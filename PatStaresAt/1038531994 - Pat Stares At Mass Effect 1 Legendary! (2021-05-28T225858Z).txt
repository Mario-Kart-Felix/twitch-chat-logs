[0:08:46] <Broken_Sonex> Tail’s cool. She’s the only good one
[0:08:49] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Can't reproduce just like Wrex
[0:08:49] <%byuniart> Can we just not talk about ME3 or anything passed it?
[0:08:50] <SaltyAzteca> Ehhhhhh

[0:08:57] <%blutzwavedave> He could have been Kaiden too
[0:08:57] <%dankgerald> I wouldve named gief Ben 10
[0:08:57] <%logoth_> Shepard
[0:08:57] <%BoxNavy> no
[0:08:58] <%JoshManVGH> Urdnot, stop bothering your brother
[0:08:58] <%Ynkubus_> nah sounds basic as fuck
[0:08:59] <%ironohki> @Goraka91 Friends and I were just talking about how we love good robot writing.
[0:09:01] <aiutare47> Mass effect started with me thinking “huh no one is really all that bad” and ended with me thinking “THEYRE ALL AWFUL”
[0:09:03] <%Monkeyweed21> grunt is better
[0:09:04] <TourettesPlays> Nah too generic
[0:09:05] <+glgzephyr> this is gonna be great
[0:09:08] <Ipsenscastle> well you'll get to make up your own mind soon
[0:09:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat I treat the Citadel DLC as post game 3 and that makes it better
[0:09:10] <%Raiden_Breaker> yeah but you would have to tell people its pronounced Wrex not Rex all the time
[0:09:10] <%Nekros4442> I mean Wrex never got ruined
[0:09:11] <knight_verse> How can you hate the Quarians when they are the Paige race?

[0:09:22] <Broken_Sonex> Nah I prefer geif
[0:09:23] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Maybe i wasn’t invested enough in the series, but I didn’t think 3 was the worst thing ever like everyone else seemingly did
[0:09:25] <+glgzephyr> ehhhhhh disagree
[0:09:26] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt are yo ugoing to play femshep?
[0:09:26] <%Cykron> I agree
[0:09:27] <%AncelDeLambert> @knight_verse fuck she IS
[0:09:27] <ExpressNode> I haven't been through it once
[0:09:28] <Blank9> vanguard RULES
[0:09:28] <%thejimjamz> Vanguard is passable
[0:09:28] <Ipsenscastle> ????
[0:09:30] <%MooseIsGoose> We about to fight
[0:09:31] <+MrFeelsWildRide> NOT TRUE, VANGUARD IS REALLY GOOD (in 3)
[0:09:32] <%sporeian94> You mean how they gave you 4 guns and you could use 1
[0:09:33] <%logoth_> I like Vanguard
[0:09:34] <%valriot> In ME3 theyre WAY WAY FUCKING BETTER
[0:09:34] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Vanguard in 2 is fun though iirc
[0:09:34] <+holyxgrale> 100% true
[0:09:36] <%JoshManVGH> I thought they got better in 2
[0:09:36] <Goraka91> Not in 2
[0:09:36] <Sunstalker> Vanguard and Sentinel are okay
[0:09:36] <%MooseIsGoose> How dare you
[0:09:38] <aiutare47> WHAT
[0:09:38] <lloyddboy> FUCK YOU VANGUARD FUCKS
[0:09:40] <%Cykron> Most of them are weak
[0:09:40] <+TheotherKristian> New changes though
[0:09:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT VANGUARD THO
[0:09:40] <primaryfire> I thought vanguard and adept were good?
[0:09:41] <RaidenRising> but space magic
[0:09:42] <Blank9> vanguard in 3 is the absolute best
[0:09:42] <%Raiden_Breaker> Soldier is easy mode
[0:09:42] <%lockhead45> vanguard is literally the best and strongest
[0:09:43] <%Monkeyweed21> BUT MY BIOTIC CHARGE
[0:09:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, that's just not true, engineer has always been good, so has Adept
[0:09:44] <+Pengers> Yes
[0:09:45] <%HankTheCapraLord> max level psi in ME1 is stupid busted
[0:09:45] <Rumbutt> Vanguard is OP as fuck in 3, but yeah soldier is way better in 1 & 2
[0:09:45] <Halospaz117> Pat that's the stupidest thing you ever said
[0:09:46] <Deasmeister> Hard disagree vanguard is great
[0:09:47] <+ScottishMadJacko> Hot take
[0:09:47] <CruxAustralis> Crazy Talk activates lmao
[0:09:49] <+Canti510> Nah, Vanguard is fucking sick
[0:09:50] <+glgzephyr> yeah that's different now
[0:09:51] <%AncelDeLambert> complete lie
[0:09:51] <RetributionP> Vanguard soldier
[0:09:52] <gringarthegreat> he's right, you know
[0:09:52] <%BoxNavy> what if they called it ass effect instead lol
[0:09:52] <Goraka91> Them's fighting words
[0:09:52] <%VioletHeart> That's a hot take alright.
[0:09:54] <%bread_assassin> Even in ME2, Sentinel was one of the best.
[0:09:54] <%valriot> ME3s gameplay FUCKS, its so good
[0:09:54] <%Garthunox> you should still pick engineer tho
[0:09:54] <rekinom> big mega wrong
[0:09:55] <Solvari> Glad you picked up the Legendary Edition Pat
[0:09:55] <MatSmith83> Soldier's the worst, most vanilla class!
[0:09:55] <%sporeian94> psaWrong ABOUT 2
[0:09:56] <%Nekros4442> Nah Soldier is super boring
[0:09:57] <Ipsenscastle> Vanguard and Infiltrator rock
[0:09:58] <%Dementedpenguin> I can already tell this is gonna be polarizing for chat. LUL
[0:09:58] <%lockhead45> literally crazy talk
[0:09:58] <%evilmagetim> What?
[0:09:59] <srv4254> thats wrong super hard
[0:09:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHERE ARE MY VAGUARD BOIS
[0:09:59] <%ironohki> @Goraka91 My favorite is Legion's talk with Shepard about how he understands individuality is important to organics, but it sounds like a nightmare to them.
[0:10:00] <%Noir_Valdr> big disagree
[0:10:01] <primaryfire> pistols fuck though
[0:10:01] <%AncelDeLambert> COOLDOWNS, PAT
[0:10:01] <%demiiluna> No, give me my Reppuken.
[0:10:01] <madpuppy2424> Press x to doubt
[0:10:01] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Will you be playing a Shepard that looks like you or Paige?
[0:10:02] <Ipsenscastle> wrong
[0:10:02] <+TaylOctopus91> Team Sentinel
[0:10:02] <%Raiden_Breaker> Infiltrator for life
[0:10:03] <aiutare47> Infiltrator for life
[0:10:03] <CruxAustralis> Biotics is OP as shit
[0:10:05] <+smuggleruncle> it's janky space bang bang with fun dialogue
[0:10:05] <RaidenRising> BUT MY SPACR MAGIC
[0:10:06] <%dankgerald> ALL SHOTGUN
[0:10:08] <@StridentSong> You are absolutely wrong
[0:10:09] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> but what if I like pistol
[0:10:09] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat you can melee the shadow broker the entire time with a combination of biotic charge and melee
[0:10:10] <%MooseIsGoose> Soldier boo
[0:10:11] <%logoth_> Vanguard + Shotgun
[0:10:11] <+athuramn> 2 infiltrator was the best but
[0:10:11] <PanicSwytch> Adept is awesome
[0:10:12] <lloyddboy> VANGUARDS RISE UP
[0:10:12] <%JoshManVGH> Vanguard teleport smash
[0:10:13] <$Futurecity10> @patstaresat sentinel in mass effect 2 is amazing
[0:10:13] <Ipsenscastle> you get all weapons for every class in ME1 now
[0:10:14] <%CalderGaming> infil
[0:10:15] <%Monkeyweed21> THATS SO WRONG
[0:10:15] <+Pengers> In 2 biotics is shit
[0:10:16] <+derrigible> at least in the remaster the sniper rifle is useable by other classes
[0:10:16] <+Canti510> Also, the revamp makes all classes way more viable
[0:10:17] <%sporeian94> THAT'S WHY YOU SHOTGUN AND CHARGE LOSER
[0:10:18] <%Noir_Valdr> Vanguard is the best class in 2
[0:10:18] <MidnightPacif1c> vanguard is the only class
[0:10:18] <%AncelDeLambert> infiltrator is pretty okay, yes
[0:10:20] <+ScottishMadJacko> Soldier is crap in 1 imo
[0:10:20] <%Retinolgaming> Retinolgaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Pat
[0:10:21] <@StridentSong> Shockwave is one of the best psionic abilities in the game
[0:10:21] <+trizetacannon44> Technician = Digital Plague Bearers
[0:10:22] <%Noir_Valdr> go fuck yourself
[0:10:22] <Sunstalker> No, the melee is good in 3 kinamaMad
[0:10:24] <Blank9> it pays off in 3
[0:10:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat They fixed that you can use all weapons no matter the class now
[0:10:24] <nobody287> you get a shotgun how does that suck
[0:10:24] <%lockhead45> biotic charge is way too good tho!
[0:10:25] <dd44dostivei> MELEE IS DIFFERENT NOW
[0:10:25] <+glgzephyr> you're not supposed to melee....
[0:10:26] <+TheWarpJump> you are so wrong lol
[0:10:26] <@StridentSong> You literally launch people out of cover
[0:10:26] <%bugz_munny> awww pat you got chat riled
[0:10:26] <%evilmagetim> Wrong
[0:10:28] <%Nekros4442> Infiltrator fucks everything up
[0:10:28] <BlackStarAura> Infiltrator for current run
[0:10:30] <%Rumbutt> ME3 melee is good, and that's why Vanguard becomes good in that game
[0:10:30] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Pat, you really need to play either Vanguard or Infiltrator on ME3. There are power combos in that game.
[0:10:31] <srv4254> infiltrator is saving my ass on insane me2
[0:10:31] <Nordguy> you played wrong
[0:10:31] <Deasmeister> Thats what the shot gun is for
[0:10:31] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU ARE SO WRONG
[0:10:31] <primaryfire> this needs a poll
[0:10:32] <%bugz_munny> CONTROVERSIAL
[0:10:33] <RetributionP> Vanguard is the best you are just incorrect
[0:10:34] <fredbet96> vanguard is better - charge OP
[0:10:35] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> DO SENTINEL
[0:10:35] <Solvari> Infiltrator was not that bad
[0:10:36] <@StridentSong> IT WORKS ON EVERYONE
[0:10:39] <$NoctisxMog> adept gang anyone?
[0:10:40] <%sporeian94> YOU GOTTA GET THEIR BARRIERS DOWN PAT
[0:10:43] <%Noir_Valdr> Pat is big wrong
[0:10:45] <PanicSwytch> ADEPT GANG RISE UP???
[0:10:47] <%lockhead45> charge OP
[0:10:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat you may need to look up a guide
[0:10:51] <GustauveVIII> in mass effect 3 the vanguard can spam biotic charge and biotic nova
[0:10:51] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat hello
[0:10:52] <ShinChris> chat synopsis: wrong, false
[0:10:54] <Ipsenscastle> All classes get all weapons in ME1 now
[0:10:55] <%Noir_Valdr> ME2 Vanguard best class and experience
[0:10:56] <amAmpersand> which colour ending are you going for? lmao
[0:10:58] <@StridentSong> Literally the only thing it doesn't work on are things with psionic shields. You take those down and it works
[0:10:59] <GustauveVIII> its great
[0:10:59] <%JoshManVGH> who cant stand behind cover?
[0:11:01] <+glgzephyr> Shockwave works on everything tho
[0:11:02] <Solvari> Pat just likes the unga bunga warrior playstyle

[0:12:46] <aiutare47> Armor
[0:12:47] <%DorianCreed> ENGINEER 24/7
[0:12:47] <+athuramn> infiltrator would literally break the game with its headshot dmv
[0:12:48] <%Noir_Valdr> Serntinel in ME1 is meh
[0:12:48] <%VioletHeart> Sentinel's rad.
[0:12:48] <+glgzephyr> yeah it's not very fun
[0:12:50] <%AncelDeLambert> it has almost no dps, yeah
[0:12:51] <Meltgar> BORING SHOOTY BOI SOLDIER
[0:12:54] <DatAsuna> Sentinels do everything and look cool in me2
[0:12:55] <%Noir_Valdr> Sentinel in ME2/3 is bagning
[0:12:56] <%sporeian94> Just drop that one then
[0:12:58] <%DorianCreed> Max out hacking, do doors yourself
[0:13:00] <%Nekros4442> Sentinel is a tank isnt it
[0:13:03] <Solvari> I think he shouldnt play Soldier because in ME1 everyone plays it
[0:13:03] <%Giantsuperguy> I played vanguard I think back in the day
[0:13:04] <+Pengers> Haha
[0:13:07] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> SENTINEL
[0:13:08] <%Raiden_Breaker> lets do this
[0:13:08] <+ScottishMadJacko> Ignore sentinel
[0:13:08] <$Futurecity10> TECH ARMOIR BABY
[0:13:09] <rekinom> I don't see the poll FUCK
[0:13:11] <DatAsuna> I am sad me3 mp is cut though, so many crazy classes
[0:13:11] <1matheuw> pick bulbasaur
[0:13:11] <BrianDLahey> Tech monkey
[0:13:13] <aiutare47> Sentinel needed to be tankier
[0:13:15] <%NocturneNovember> cheer500 Been watching Feel play through the series and despite never romancing her (Liara gang rise up), him calling Tali "imouto-chan" has completely ruined her for me.
[0:13:18] <%Dementedpenguin> Pat: DANCE MONKEYS
[0:13:19] <Goraka91> @Nekros4442 It's a tank in...3? Maybe 2?
[0:13:19] <Sunstalker> Vanguard fuckbois represent
[0:13:21] <%dooscent> Vanguard in 1 is pretty bad
[0:13:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> But you need tech to unlock shit, unless you want to force yourself to always have certain party members
[0:13:25] <PhantonBat> Which one would make him the most mad?
[0:13:26] <+glgzephyr> wait where's the poll?
[0:13:26] <+TheotherKristian> Where is it?
[0:13:26] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Infiltrator is fine, but most biotic classes are useless
[0:13:27] <Blank9> vanguard does the cool dash and has the good powers and a shotgun, then does melee
[0:13:29] <%pokefan9956> engineer you cowards
[0:13:29] <Meltgar> Ask zangief for the class Kappa
[0:13:29] <valentine_cyphre> my favourite X men character
[0:13:30] <%Dunsparcetheglare> Sentinel is bae
[0:13:31] <%dankgerald> how do i vote on mobile
[0:13:32] <%ssjklyco> Vote so that Pat can ignore us and do what he wants.
[0:13:33] <DatAsuna> sentinel is the do everything boi
[0:13:36] <wisconsinjoe> I don’t know what any of these are but I’m voting engineer
[0:13:38] <SaltyAzteca> I also missed that fish

[0:14:11] <+glgzephyr> I found it LUL
[0:14:13] <ARDM112> ME1 Vanguard is meh but so is ME1 Infiltrator
[0:14:13] <kanekisoul> infiltrator
[0:14:14] <%chance_h> Infiltrator is for cowards who are bad at shooting and powers
[0:14:17] <%Garthunox> You gonna save the Space Racist or New Carth?
[0:14:26] <+ScottishMadJacko> Im just glad you can change classes between games on the same save
[0:14:28] <Sunstalker> Vanguard top chice just so you can Charge into a Krogan for super headbut
[0:14:31] <Goraka91> Wars? Not Trek?
[0:14:31] <+glgzephyr> Infiltrator is much better now with the ADS changes in ME1
[0:14:35] <Jontman42> that's probably easy
[0:14:37] <%MassConnect> Yes
[0:14:39] <Blank9> that's easy, just reference trek

[0:24:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> Give Gief a smooch for me

[0:24:33] <marcdyllan> The fact that little fat thing is supposed to FIGHT BULLS is amazing

[0:25:14] <%MidnightBurst12> :)
[0:25:14] <AShinyVagikarp> KappaCool
[0:25:15] <+Noraje> Well it does suck in ME1...
[0:25:15] <%dooscent> Vanguard ain't got the charge. It's real boring in 1.
[0:25:16] <%Aeogard> LUL
[0:25:16] <primaryfire> it's cooler in 2 when you get the charge
[0:25:16] <nobody287> just use the shotgun at all ranges
[0:25:17] <kasteni> I remember the description “vanguard is like being Han Solo and Luke Skywalker at the same time”
[0:25:17] <hamborgini> gitcher wagglin' finger ready
[0:25:17] <%Noir_Valdr> fine, Soldier for 1, Vanguard for 2 and 3
[0:25:18] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> Vanguard does suck in ME1. But in ME2 and 3...
[0:25:18] <%Garthunox> DO IT COWARD
[0:25:18] <%Evilpuppys> re vote
[0:25:19] <DatAsuna> woolie will probably be told to play vanguard too. lol
[0:25:19] <Halospaz117> All classes suck in ME1
[0:25:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter Vanguard is good in every game with a shotgun, its amazing in 3 with the melee changes
[0:25:20] <%AncelDeLambert> engineer, gimme that BURN BURN BURN
[0:25:20] <+Vigonept> DAMN ZEITGEIST
[0:25:21] <Goraka91> Enemy is everywhere!
[0:25:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They tweaked the classes
[0:25:22] <+holyxgrale> It was me :)
[0:25:23] <%VioletHeart> I think everyone's in agreement that soldier sucks though.
[0:25:23] <Ipsenscastle> it's just soldier with biotics, whats the problem
[0:25:24] <battlexqueen> yuuuuppp
[0:25:24] <rcand9> boo
[0:25:27] <%ssjklyco> This is when  you start screen capping chat and shame postig it on twitter
[0:25:27] <+ScottishMadJacko> It doesnt suck, its just that adept was pretty op in me1
[0:25:28] <rcand9> lame
[0:25:28] <+Pengers> @celiohogane not when I lose 🥲
[0:25:29] <firewhiskeys> as a vanguard main, vanguard still sucks in me1
[0:25:29] <digaogrunge> Vanguard is good from 2 onward
[0:25:31] <+TheotherKristian> You could just not follow the Democratic vote...
[0:25:32] <%bread_assassin> Soldier got nerfed in ME1, too.
[0:25:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> That shit sucked
[0:25:32] <DatAsuna> Just do 5 playthroughs!
[0:25:35] <DatAsuna> at the same time!
[0:25:35] <%Nekros4442> Vanguard doesnt even have charge in 1 does it
[0:25:36] <%MajorCrasher> you fool, we picked it to make you suffer @patstaresat LUL
[0:25:36] <GrayFox517> biotics are incredibly useful in me1 because they work on shielded enemies
[0:25:37] <%TheMattman1313> This Democracy has failed, I'm succeeding.
[0:25:37] <%MoguManda> hell yeah
[0:25:38] <iosephe> why
[0:25:38] <aiutare47> Infiltrator gets a get-out-of-jail-free card, a kill button, and shield remove button
[0:25:38] <+nokturnas2077> Vangaurd DOES SUCK
[0:25:41] <%Aeogard> i really hope ME1 is still mostly RPG...
[0:25:42] <+JaseAdrift> NotLikeThis

[0:25:46] <%StrawberryPantsu> WHY
[0:25:47] <%toastybites> explains a lot

[0:25:48] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Its better then ME2 Vanguard
[0:25:48] <mortificent> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:25:49] <Halospaz117> hot
[0:25:50] <Dead_Trickster> Maybe if all the people who didn't pick vanguard weren't being selfish and instead all picked the same class, Pat wouldn't be stuck playing Vanguard for ME1. Think about that.

[0:27:34] <+notgarza> Mindbreak
[0:27:39] <%ironohki> "Screw star wars. We'll make our own sci fi with blackjack and sexy blue space hookers!" - Bioware, probably.
[0:27:39] <ape_hawk> maleshep is a sub, femshep is a dom
[0:27:41] <1matheuw> theres probably a video of someone testing it on the internet
[0:27:43] <vVAstrAVv> why that reaction pat youve said worse

[0:27:57] <%AncelDeLambert> the one that does Saren's backstory is TERRIBLE
[0:28:02] <%Raiden_Breaker> oh are they worth a read
[0:28:04] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> They're pretty damn good.
[0:28:12] <%AncelDeLambert> they fuck up an already tight and stupid post-war timeline
[0:28:12] <Halospaz117> Oh god which novel is that fucking horrible one that just fucks the lore?
[0:28:14] <+Vigonept> books sucks games good
[0:28:17] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I think one of the books is about Anderson.

[0:28:43] <+athuramn> Holy shit harvester looks metal
[0:28:44] <%sporeian94> Deception is actually the worst. It's written by a guy who doesn't know about Mass Effect and made shit up based off terms. Like Biotics literally level up like a video game
[0:28:48] <DatAsuna> Like the last one is a different writer a FULL of dumb mistakes
[0:28:50] <aiutare47> I don’t remember anything about the books even though I think I read them.

[0:40:30] <+necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt fun story: I picked femShep when I was a teenager in Brazil because I hated maleShep's voice so much and didn't understand why. later in life I learned what a Canadian accent is.

[0:40:38] <+Midashu> You can't bang ashley and then kill her, the banging happens AFTER THE DEATH
[0:40:40] <+athuramn> your brain is a wonderful place
[0:40:40] <%NocturneNovember> Feel had a bit war going through ME1 between Ashley or Kaidan and one dude donated enough bits to kill Kaidan because drywall's worse than space racism I guess.

[0:45:31] <%Monkeyweed21> @rcand9 all of Kojima's major games turned a huge profit, including MGS5 and Death Stranding
[0:45:34] <SaltyAzteca> OH GEEZ LET IT DIE

[0:45:44] <%sporeian94> LOL NOPE
[0:45:46] <%troubled_ginger> troubled_ginger subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! I come in for some Mass Effect, and I immediately hear the vein story. I think Shepard's signature line "I should go" fits in this scenario.

[0:45:54] <moonmeh> yeah bioware is deeeead
[0:45:54] <+Promessa_EX> no ethical consumption pat
[0:45:55] <Dabrikishaw> Oh, the old Bioware is long gone.
[0:45:55] <WG101> @SaltyAzteca CW PPG will never die
[0:45:56] <%pokefan9956> everybody will leave and a new studio will become bioware
[0:45:57] <$RealThiele> they are being digested currently by EA
[0:45:57] <%condemned_15> CW is re-shooting that Pilot. It's not dead yet
[0:45:58] <%sporeian94> Mac Walters is still unfortuantely there

[0:46:07] <+necrocannibal2> it's a ship of theseus thing
[0:46:09] <+thegreenbenis> Bioware is a fucking zombie
[0:46:13] <+Vigonept> EVEN THE DENTISTS
[0:46:14] <%troubled_ginger> Same applies to "Obsidian"
[0:46:15] <%Raiden_Breaker> tried playing DA:O 3 times got stuck every time
[0:46:17] <+Sleepy_Puma> Obsidian GOOOOD
[0:46:19] <Jaysky> A husk
[0:46:20] <%StebTheVee> They're working for CDPR now
[0:46:20] <wasdsf> Hudson did leave AGAIN
[0:46:21] <Dabrikishaw> There's never going to be another KOTOR, Mass Effect 1, Dragon Age Origins, or Bauldur's Gate ever again.
[0:46:22] <%MoguManda> Mac Walter's Mass Effect 4
[0:46:25] <28moogles> That's not true, most of the writers are still there, the LEAD writers just left.
[0:46:25] <Lee_The_Limey> They got EAids, and it's terminal Kappa
[0:46:26] <+robosqueeb> is hamburger helper still there?
[0:46:27] <digaogrunge> Bioware is dead, Long live Bioware
[0:46:28] <dd44dostivei> walters was in charge of remaster
[0:46:28] <AoG_JarlRaven> Yeah the people who made bioware great are gone
[0:46:30] <pipboy344> @realthiele Slowly over a thousand years in the belly of the sarlacc
[0:46:30] <%pokefan9956> oof
[0:46:30] <AmuserName> Drew Karpyshyn's writing :(
[0:46:32] <rcand9> @Monkeyweed21 how about that under budget bit
[0:46:33] <%Pappajimbo> but you replaced the wood with shit
[0:46:34] <%Raikouija> BioWare is like Bungie, a shell of its former self and in name only
[0:46:37] <%sporeian94> Hudson left, came back, and then left AGAIN
[0:46:37] <%afronooch> @wasdsf LUL
[0:46:40] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:46:40] <Jaysky> BioWare is a husked out corpse of a studio
[0:46:43] <%bugz_munny> I dont think they can make a game
[0:46:51] <+CookieCutter007> the brain drain FeelsBadMan
[0:46:52] <Ipsenscastle> yeah it'll never come back properly
[0:46:53] <DatAsuna> Karpyshyn can write great stuff but also pretty awful
[0:46:55] <%sporeian94> Jade Empire "series" you mean the one game
[0:46:58] <DatAsuna> I WISH JADE EMPIRE WAS A SERIES
[0:46:59] <+glgzephyr> it really is
[0:47:01] <balthazar758> ghoul bioware
[0:47:05] <+Midashu> Pat is super right
[0:47:05] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Feelings on the new game with Liara?
[0:47:08] <SaltyAzteca> Just like Dead Space.
[0:47:10] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[0:47:12] <%GarbageNirvana> They would need to restructure that studio from the ground up insofar as the way it does its work
[0:47:16] <1matheuw> is jade empire any good guys?
[0:47:17] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> too bad Chris Avellone was a scumbag
[0:47:19] <%sporeian94> Dragon Age 2 is the mark of the downfall of bioware
[0:47:21] <%bugz_munny> dude origins was good
[0:47:22] <+glgzephyr> Origins to 2
[0:47:23] <+necrocannibal2> Dragon Age died in the second game
[0:47:24] <Profmcstevie> speed bumps became ramps became mountains
[0:47:24] <%Arkfyre> EAification is the worst tag
[0:47:26] <%Mr_Pylon> It's amazing how many 3s got fucked up by EA, Dragon Age, Dead Space, Mass Effect
[0:47:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> They know they can't bilk a series for as long now Kappa
[0:47:29] <DatAsuna> Jade Empire has probably the best bioware villain
[0:47:30] <+robosqueeb> dead space monkaS
[0:47:31] <Ipsenscastle> Dragon Age took a single year to self destruct
[0:47:32] <+athuramn> ah but money does wonders when you throw more and more of it at a comatose game
[0:47:34] <DatAsuna> Straight up
[0:47:34] <%Monkeyweed21> DA2's problem was having like 12 months to make it
[0:47:35] <1matheuw> thats a good way to put it
[0:47:37] <$RealThiele> then once digestion is complete they go into the corpse pile
[0:47:37] <+glgzephyr> Origins was one of the best D&D games I've ever played
[0:47:41] <%BoxNavy> monkaS ?
[0:47:41] <%JoshManVGH> BiOwArE mAgIc!!
[0:47:43] <%Raikouija> And then the big lie about the ending of ME3
[0:47:49] <digaogrunge> DA2 hurts
[0:47:51] <hamborgini> jade empire had a part that would crash my xbox every time I tried to play it, and I haven't been able to stick with a bioware game since
[0:47:51] <%Garthunox> Pat I made 40 Glade Gazebos on 14 and they are selling like hotcakes for almost 100k a piece, I love crafting
[0:47:51] <%sporeian94> RIOT PUNCH
[0:47:53] <%BoxNavy> quebec monkaS
[0:47:54] <+Promessa_EX> pat will stay home for at least 2 more years
[0:47:55] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Amazing
[0:47:55] <aiutare47> its that bad?
[0:47:59] <DatAsuna> Jade Empire shows it's age but it's a something special in their catalogue
[0:48:02] <%Monkeyweed21> DA2 literally had less dev time than KOTOR 2
[0:48:02] <DianaTheAscian> YUP
[0:48:03] <+ekodrop> have the habs lost yet?
[0:48:03] <Broken_Sonex> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx What did he do again?
[0:48:04] <CrypticMochi> Is Jade Empire janky? It’s been so long I don’t remember how it plays
[0:48:05] <42nfl19> Wood or aluminum? @PatStaresAt
[0:48:08] <%TheMattman1313> Grease the outside of your house
[0:48:09] <%Raiden_Breaker> with 4 they should restart with charters that survive the trilogy
[0:48:11] <%pokefan9956> hang on. what's going on?
[0:48:13] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Buy a gun
[0:48:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:48:16] <Jaysky> I still enjoy ME3 but the last 10 minutes are absolutely disappointing
[0:48:16] <DatAsuna> Jade Empire having bi romances also makes it hilarious that they cowarded out in ME1/2
[0:48:18] <%Takreth> The three Bs will never do us wrong
[0:48:20] <+thegreenbenis> Wood is best for that. @PatStaresAt
[0:48:25] <+glgzephyr> lmao
[0:48:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat with actual real gun is scary
[0:48:31] <%Reveresao> LUL
[0:48:31] <rcand9> true
[0:48:32] <%sporeian94> YEAH BUT CHEIVOS PAT
[0:48:32] <$Futurecity10> BUT ITS FUN
[0:48:32] <OldOnyx> Jade Empire has some of the most obvious foreshadowing I have seen in a game
[0:48:34] <Goraka91> True
[0:48:34] <1matheuw> why buy gun when you have H A N D S
[0:48:34] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Can you believe that shit though? $1700 to $8000 to go to a hockey game.
[0:48:35] <%StrawberryPantsu> 3 is an OKAY shooter
[0:48:38] <+necrocannibal2> eh, I had fun on Insanity
[0:48:38] <DatAsuna> ME3 is pretty good on insanity
[0:48:38] <%patriotrenegade> THE THREE B’S
[0:48:39] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Insanity is what it says it is
[0:48:39] <+Ghufufin> but muh gamer skilllz
[0:48:41] <%Noir_Valdr> no, it was fun.
[0:48:41] <+athuramn> this is true
[0:48:43] <%snow_bush> Vanguard is great for that high risk/high reward difficulty runs
[0:48:44] <%fredbet96> PREACH
[0:48:47] <+Calek> play Mass Effect on Veteran like a normal person
[0:48:47] <+CookieCutter007> LUL the nade spam
[0:48:47] <%snow_bush> GRENADE SPAM
[0:48:48] <T_Sasquatch> It's never fun
[0:48:48] <+Vigonept> it usually sucks
[0:48:48] <+Promessa_EX> if pat got a gun, we would just get a Boogie situation
[0:48:49] <%valriot> Nightmare Doom Eternal slaps
[0:48:49] <%Garthunox> but the cheevo
[0:48:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's almost always trash
[0:48:51] <+GoBoomYay> ive beaten every game on insanity, ALL classes are viable wtf lol
[0:48:51] <%Raikouija> @datasuna thank Fox News kicking up a fuss causing that
[0:48:51] <+glgzephyr> it's for a certain kind of person
[0:48:52] <+Pengers> Bs
[0:48:52] <$Futurecity10> I've beaten 10 COD's in veteren
[0:48:52] <%scaryboisupreme> I just beat ME1 and 2 on Insanity and it's miserable i can't wait to do 3
[0:48:53] <%Noir_Valdr> Sigh.
[0:48:53] <%MaraSmug> I finished 100% Mass Effect Legendary last night, insanity isnt alllll that bad
[0:48:53] <+Fooguwu> except Titanfall 2
[0:48:55] <+Nomad_Scholar> Never play on Veteran
[0:48:55] <%Varlinator> Do it once for the trophy, then NEVER AGAIN!
[0:48:55] <Draco_Renegade> COD's Realistic difficulty is the worst
[0:48:56] <Hoffo> nah it's fun
[0:48:56] <+necrocannibal2> Gears on Insane is fun
[0:48:57] <Profmcstevie> Halo 1 Legendary was only tolerable with a friend
[0:48:57] <+Midashu> GRENAAAADE
[0:48:58] <kasteni> The true true
[0:48:58] <%Raiden_Breaker> its so much easier after playing warzone
[0:48:58] <%kewlmyc> It becomes "memorize the spawns"
[0:48:58] <+Vigonept> EXCEPT FO4 that ones great on survival
[0:48:59] <%GarbageNirvana> I never liked how the CoDs did difficulty
[0:49:00] <%ExpressNode> I tried play Halo 2 like that, didn't have fun
[0:49:00] <%Garthunox> its usually for the cheevo
[0:49:01] <%Noir_Valdr> Pat ther wrong and bad.
[0:49:02] <%troubled_ginger> "Watch out of the grenade danger indicator"
[0:49:04] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> getting 1-3 tapped in any game is awful
[0:49:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> DOOM ETERNAL
[0:49:06] <AmuserName> But I'm USED TO Mass Effect on Insanity, Pat!
[0:49:07] <+Solutha> steamrolling everything is boring
[0:49:07] <%Tearonex> Halo Legendary is amazing
[0:49:09] <DatAsuna> @OldOnyx aye, the twist is super obvious. Still a great relationship tho. And I like that the third ending exists at all
[0:49:09] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @Broken_Sonex Got accused of sexual misconduct at some industry conventions by a few people
[0:49:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> DOOM ETERNAL SAYS HELLO
[0:49:11] <%sporeian94> @NoHoldsBarredProductions you think that's bad. The Patriots-Buccs game this year has tickets starting at like 10k
[0:49:11] <%Raiden_Breaker> its fucked how good kids are these days
[0:49:12] <Dabrikishaw> Yeah, I'm replaying the trilogy on Normal for the same reason
[0:49:19] <pipboy344> @patstaresat What about simulations like Arma where 1-2 bullets can kill?
[0:49:20] <T_Sasquatch> I played uncharted 4 on the 2nd hardest difficulty and it was stress
[0:49:21] <rcand9> i dont know many shooters that get better on the highest difficulties except stalker thats easier on hard
[0:49:21] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I played nearly every COD on Veteran.
[0:49:25] <%StrawberryPantsu> A third person shooter is only as good as it's blind fire.
[0:49:25] <+D00msDayDan> halo reach on legendary is almost fun, or maybe that's just stockholm syndrome talking
[0:49:26] <+athuramn> infiltrator is just good tho, regardless. makes more sense for the space diplomat than some guy charging with a shotgun
[0:49:30] <Profmcstevie> Call of Duty World At War on highest difficulty is just throwing back 17 grenades LUL
[0:49:34] <1matheuw> unless its one of those shooter with direct inverse scaling or some shit
[0:49:36] <tubit> Yeah that was not good
[0:49:37] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @sporeian94 Yeah but that's to be expected from the NFL 😂
[0:49:41] <%RageCasanova> RageCasanova subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! YES! LETS GO EFFECT THEM MASSES! Been cruising on through legendary edition myself.  Found the rebalancing in legendary to be fascinating.  Get that Katana shotty and learn dem Geth real good. Yee!

[0:49:44] <$RealThiele> muppet at the end
[0:49:45] <+Promessa_EX> it's too bad every veteran cod cheats
[0:49:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Stop doing that now
[0:49:46] <%shurtal> slip sliding away
[0:49:47] <%THATGUY_789> the best one yet
[0:49:47] <DatAsuna> I enjoy low TTK games in multiplayer but in single player campaigns yeah not so much
[0:49:47] <+ekodrop> it got british
[0:49:51] <aiutare47> infiltrator is the best class
[0:49:53] <%UncleAWOL> I beat Modern Warfare 2 on veteran to prove a point to some stuck up guy in 8 the grade and I hated every fucking second of it
[0:49:59] <+Jack8274> Jedi Fallen Order made parry times tighter and have less health, but enemies stay the same difficulty
[0:49:59] <1matheuw> why did pat is the british
[0:50:01] <%JoshManVGH> Ozzy ozzy Ozzy?
[0:50:05] <marcdyllan> I though that was english
[0:50:20] <1matheuw> i thought he was american

[0:50:22] <%BoxNavy> you hear canadas gettin ready to give out the second shot?
[0:50:25] <+ekodrop> wut why would anyone go to pf changs
[0:50:26] <pipboy344> I think the Particle Rifle is the best weapon in Mass Effect 3
[0:50:27] <rcand9> thats pretty cool
[0:50:29] <+Jack8274> Just remmeber it takes 2 weeks for the antibodies to kick in
[0:50:41] <T_Sasquatch> @jack8274 that game is fucking full shit on the hard difficulty.
[0:50:41] <%Raiden_Breaker> sunglasses so I CANT SEE THERE STARES

[0:51:02] <%bugz_munny> YO FUCK THAT NOCTURNE REMASTER LOCKED AT 30
[0:51:08] <jimmytwofeet> I feel personally attacked
[0:51:11] <$Futurecity10> @pipboy344 Go vanguard and unequip all weapons and fly across the screen for 5 minutes
[0:51:12] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> I just got Pfizered today which was good. Zero side effects thus far.
[0:51:17] <%NomieOhs> NomieOhs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Pat. Always a joy to tune in to your sassary :)
[0:51:17] <Profmcstevie> Better yet GIVE me your computer you're using it wrong at 30fps Kappa
[0:51:17] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Are you going to be playing through the entire trilogy?

[0:51:25] <Dabrikishaw> @The Nocturne Remaster is sad
[0:51:27] <%BoxNavy> thanks atlus :)
[0:51:28] <%ExpressNode> Whoa fuck that
[0:51:29] <%sporeian94> It has 1440p
[0:51:30] <linSP> its locked to 30 due to game logic bs
[0:51:32] <+Promessa_EX> 2nd shot did nothing to me
[0:51:33] <%troubled_ginger> 1080 is fine
[0:51:40] <DianaTheAscian> thats really funny
[0:51:42] <DatAsuna> lazy console port yeah
[0:51:42] <rcand9> 30 IS fine for turnbased shit
[0:51:42] <ape_hawk> does anyone care about the Horizon 2 30 fps lock thing?
[0:51:44] <+glgzephyr> lmao
[0:51:45] <%sporeian94> IT'S A TURN BASED GAME
[0:51:47] <%MoguManda> fuck game logic
[0:51:48] <Dabrikishaw> No real effort put into anything except easy mode DLC
[0:51:49] <%bugz_munny> they should have solved that
[0:51:50] <%mike2hands> #30fps gand where you at!!
[0:51:53] <%bugz_munny> and the audio
[0:51:53] <$Futurecity10> He literally called it bullshit
[0:51:55] <tubit> Play Civilization at 144fps or don't play it at all!
[0:51:57] <%ExpressNode> There's older games that run 60fps
[0:51:58] <$alex_streams_a_thing> im sure someone will mod it to go @60
[0:51:59] <$RealThiele> japannnn
[0:52:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's bad programming
[0:52:01] <Profmcstevie> it's common and dumb
[0:52:04] <+Promessa_EX> if they re released Twisted Metal 2, it's locked to 20fps
[0:52:05] <%sporeian94> going to 120fps doesn't break the fucking game
[0:52:05] <digaogrunge> gotta wait for the bitcoin market to crash to buy a graphics card
[0:52:08] <%skeleklng> I have an actual better experience emulating SMT3 on PCSX than I do the remaster
[0:52:09] <pipboy344> @ape_hawk The fuck?
[0:52:11] <+Calek> what's going to happen if you set it to 60, Mot only casts beasts eye?

[0:53:24] <heyterezi> @GustauveVIII it was 2007
[0:53:28] <Basch71> Renegade Shep in 2 is peak meme
[0:53:31] <%THATGUY_789> fuck carth, kill carth
[0:53:32] <%Lion_kun> Femshep is Canon Shep
[0:53:42] <+glgzephyr> it really did and it was a miracle
[0:53:44] <%ironohki> @Lion_kun I agree with this.
[0:53:45] <+Calek> the only thing that matters in ME1 now is that snipers are functional
[0:53:46] <%sporeian94> the sniper rifle actually works now, it doesn't fire once and then take 20 seconds to cool down
[0:53:48] <%radda343> "I'm Commander Shepherd and I'm willing to sell out for a tiny discount at this one store"
[0:53:48] <pipboy344> @necrocannibal2 Fucking Hobbit made me sick
[0:53:48] <rcand9> i love it the most tho its garbage
[0:53:49] <%UncleAWOL> Mass Effect 1 is really hard to go back to
[0:53:49] <$RealThiele> bioware magic LUL
[0:53:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Mass Affect instead of Mass Effect?
[0:53:53] <+necrocannibal2> it's literally some guys who only made RPGs making a third person shooter
[0:53:54] <+javolta> wrong
[0:53:57] <Ipsenscastle> It played better than I remembered on replay
[0:53:59] <+OG_M_Bison> Renegade Shep is the funniest shit ever
[0:54:03] <+JaseAdrift> mass effect 1 was fucking rough
[0:54:03] <%Raiden_Breaker> management was bad and it got slightly better in 2
[0:54:04] <%RageCasanova> So far the biggest I've seen is everyone is able to use every weapon
[0:54:04] <+OG_M_Bison> Can't take them seriously lol
[0:54:04] <$Futurecity10> There is no rebalencing, equip explosive round and launch mother fuckers into the stratospehere
[0:54:05] <+evbites> I liked explosive shotgun
[0:54:06] <%valriot> Would it be a MASS improvement
[0:54:09] <Aeroallways> oh the changes are wild but it still feels like the old game except more playable.
[0:54:12] <srv4254> 2 is so much better than 1 its crazy
[0:54:14] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[0:54:15] <DianaTheAscian> oh yeah
[0:54:15] <rcand9> put the bad shooting back IN
[0:54:16] <%sporeian94> then they turned it into Gears Lite
[0:54:18] <Blank9> 3 has INCREDIBLE gameplay
[0:54:18] <Aeroallways> snipers are my main weapon now
[0:54:19] <rcand9> BOO
[0:54:21] <+glgzephyr> WOW BIG INNOVATION
[0:54:24] <%Frodiddly> I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW IT
[0:54:25] <%ironohki> @Lion_kun I would possibly suggest: paragon manshep, renegade ladyshep.
[0:54:29] <DatAsuna> Well ME2 basically just threw out the ME1 GDD and went gears of war. Luckily gears of war is pretty good.
[0:54:29] <%Raiden_Breaker> COVER SYSTEM SHOCKING!!!
[0:54:30] <%sporeian94> 3 IS JUST GEARS
[0:54:31] <iosephe> Reload the heat sinks into your gun
[0:54:32] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[0:54:32] <Blank9> it was a sliding scale of gameplay vs story for the series
[0:54:32] <TourettesPlays> They changed barely anything in me1
[0:54:35] <digaogrunge> RELOAD YOUR GUN
[0:54:35] <%GarbageNirvana> We were fuckin hungry back in the day
[0:54:36] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Didn’t it come out the same year as NEW VEGAS?
[0:54:37] <+MightyDuckShoes> @gustauveviii They didn't expect anyone to choose him at all. He's just there for straight girl games (who don't exist.) Only Male Shep and Hot LezShep. I regret sparing Kaiden. He's a silent NPC for Male Shep after that
[0:54:41] <%ironohki> @radda343 Literally true.
[0:54:41] <$RealThiele> more gun? GOAT
[0:54:44] <+necrocannibal2> yeah and Gears is awesome
[0:54:45] <logothete2401> i did like the ammo system in ME1
[0:54:45] <+glgzephyr> @sporeian94 2 is also just Gears
[0:54:51] <Deasmeister> 3 actually plays well at least
[0:54:52] <%ironohki> @radda343 MULTIPLE stores.
[0:54:52] <DatAsuna> @sporeian94 nah 2 is just gears, 3 is when they started actually adding their own stuff
[0:54:54] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Which character is worse. Kaiden the Carth or Ashley the Spacist?
[0:55:01] <kasteni> I’m Commander Shepherd and Kaiden is my favorite Carth on the Citidel.
[0:55:04] <%sporeian94> 3 References The Retcon
[0:55:13] <+evbites> i liked overloading
[0:55:13] <%Raiden_Breaker> I love thermal ammo
[0:55:15] <%scaryboisupreme> ME1 is now incredibly easy cause you can just finger of god everything with the sniper rifle now that it actually works
[0:55:17] <anAngryHamster> Heat sinks are so stupid
[0:55:18] <%sporeian94> 3 makes fun of "Why did we go back to fucking ammo?"
[0:55:19] <ThatGuyThere03> supposedly the gameplay in 3 is fucking sick
[0:55:19] <%ironohki> @kasteni That's not bad.
[0:55:19] <logothete2401> Its absolutely incredible
[0:55:20] <RaidenRising> it bogins
[0:55:20] <dauver> me 2 reloads are decently explained tho
[0:55:21] <Dabrikishaw> The EA-fication really did start with Mass Effect 2
[0:55:22] <%Raiden_Breaker> I love that animation
[0:55:22] <%DorianCreed> T H E R M A L C L I P S
[0:55:24] <%MoguManda> uhhhh the racism was worse lol
[0:55:24] <%UncleAWOL> ME3 even HAS AN OLD GUN WITH THE OLD OVERHEAT
[0:55:28] <%Raiden_Breaker> of the clip poping
[0:55:30] <+GoBoomYay> The reload thing is hilarious even IN context
[0:55:31] <rcand9> I liked when my weapons constantly overheated you dont know!
[0:55:33] <Ids560> that ammo shit is real indicative to the series' stance towards internal consistency from that point on
[0:55:33] <%pokefan9956> emlo?
[0:55:33] <%BoxNavy> 🐋
[0:55:37] <+ScottishMadJacko> Wrex
[0:55:38] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Isn't the clips in ME2 just electable heat sinks?
[0:55:40] <DatAsuna> The omni gel explanation was a lot weaker
[0:55:45] <pipboy344> @uncleawol A few actually
[0:55:47] <DatAsuna> When's pat getting sponsored by keeps?
[0:55:48] <%RageCasanova> I seen it

[1:27:49] <%kid_flashionable> oh hey it's Spat's twin!
[1:27:49] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Fun fact Pressly is a huge racist
[1:27:50] <%0ptimuscr1me> They darkened Pressly's hair for the remaster because his age in the original made no sense
[1:27:51] <DatAsuna> da reft
[1:27:52] <digaogrunge> PRESSLY STOLE YOUR STYLE
[1:27:55] <kasteni> That guy over there is playing Galiga
[1:27:56] <AngryAsian5> CENTRIST

[1:27:58] <%LouieRouie> "Yes I am, me"
[1:28:01] <+black_pariah> @ScreamLord  i agree with you, but keeping with your example the kid had a gun with a bunch of godzillas in it
[1:28:03] <lloyddboy> CENTRIST PLAYTHROUGH
[1:28:11] <%sporeian94> Humans can literally live to be 150 in this universe
[1:28:11] <bellmorgu> its left i think
[1:28:13] <derap41> I mean its the future
[1:28:14] <+Midashu> Shepard talking to his REAL dad
[1:28:14] <%NateyBeak> harry kim NEVER promoted
[1:28:14] <olaksi> always pick either paragon or renegade, never neutral, like a crazy person
[1:28:18] <%NovaKnightmare> Is Mass Effect Noble Dark compared to Star Wars/Trek being Noble Light/Neutral?
[1:28:20] <rekinom> Enlightened Centrist Patrick Shepard
[1:28:23] <%scaryboisupreme> Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace Racism!
[1:28:23] <+necrocannibal2> IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT A MIRROR
[1:28:24] <Yrefe> right is advance conversation, left is learn more
[1:28:27] <DatAsuna> two bowling bowls talking to each other
[1:28:30] <Halospaz117> Look at this bald conversation
[1:28:35] <DatAsuna> balls even
[1:28:35] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I like that Pressly was older
[1:28:36] <derap41> Bald Racism
[1:28:38] <HaroldDonchee> that episode of star trek where picard never became captain fucked me up
[1:28:41] <rcand9> punch pressely in his deck
[1:28:44] <Halospaz117> They should touch scalps
[1:28:47] <derap41> we've got an echo
[1:28:48] <ihaveahugepersonality> commander why are you bald?
[1:28:48] <olaksi> distressing lack of hair in this scene
[1:28:54] <dd44dostivei> they should touch balds
[1:28:57] <%QueequegTheater> "Why do you look older than me, Commander"
[1:28:58] <+necrocannibal2> yeah, there's echo
[1:29:00] <+AmericanSkidd> small echo
[1:29:04] <%Ranryu692> oh god, the Normandy is the Defiant
[1:29:08] <%templar010> ALL THE DIALOGUE ALL THE TIME
[1:29:11] <%LouieRouie> Why can't you have Pressly's beard?
[1:29:12] <+athuramn> a lot good that stealth system does
[1:29:13] <jaggstar2020> What do you know about krogan testicles
[1:29:13] <WG101> "goodbye"
[1:29:14] <Broken_Sonex> @derap41 Shhh.
[1:29:15] <kasteni> You’ve got a lot of bowls Shepherd
[1:29:22] <%NopeBadguy> WAIT IS HE CALLED NIHLIS BC OF KOTOR 2
[1:29:26] <+babyacid> Nah, Normandy Reborn is the best
[1:29:27] <$Wurmspawn> Echo gone.
[1:29:28] <atsu333> Hmm. Prototype stealth drive? That sounds familiar as well.
[1:29:29] <derap41> Its gone good job
[1:29:33] <PanicSwytch> PERFECT
[1:29:33] <Goraka91> @NopeBadguy Sure is
[1:29:34] <rcand9> no echo
[1:29:36] <%Monkeyweed21> no echo
[1:29:37] <+zajoestar> still there
[1:29:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Nope, still bald
[1:29:40] <Rei_Dsoto> Sounds fine to me.
[1:29:41] <%NovaKnightmare> I love the name the Normandy
[1:29:46] <Reanimator83> Not enough hair 0/10 ign
[1:29:47] <%templar010> Anderson fucking rules
[1:29:50] <Savior127> oh my god it looks like their lips are shrinking and enlarging whenever they speak
[1:29:51] <%Reveresao> o7 Anderson
[1:29:53] <+titansloth93> that's a great line
[1:29:58] <%psidefx> VoteYea
[1:29:58] <bigshedman> That's a LOT of medals LUL
[1:29:59] <+robosqueeb> look at all the balds onscreen
[1:30:01] <ScreamLord> @black_pariah Potentially. Or it coulda been full of blanks. And considering how rare sapient life is in the galaxy, and even rarer advanced sapients, blanks is way more likely
[1:30:08] <+necrocannibal2> the thing is, he's right
[1:30:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Eh, this might be tantamount to a vacation for him, you never know
[1:30:11] <+chiazam> That can't possibly be true
[1:30:12] <%NovaKnightmare> FUCKING XENOS
[1:30:14] <%UncleAWOL> oh look space racism
[1:30:14] <%sporeian94> JUST A QUICK TEST RUN IN AND OUT IN 5 MINUTES SHEP
[1:30:16] <Goraka91> Hey remember when Fox called this game a rape simulator, clowns
[1:30:17] <%scaryboisupreme> Racism runs in the gamily
[1:30:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[1:30:19] <murdocismyhero> Is it the Reapers?  I think it might be the reapers
[1:30:20] <%condemned_15> psaBig Racism
[1:30:20] <+athuramn> Sheppard and presley look like they're relatives
[1:30:20] <%dave323dave> i am a space racist. Runs in the family
[1:30:23] <%luckyturtelle> like looking into a mirror
[1:30:23] <ape_hawk> pressly is a SPACIST
[1:30:25] <+MightyDuckShoes> that's not the only thing that runs in the family...
[1:30:28] <+Toaderator> grandfather?
[1:30:31] <%Varlinator> 26 years ago
[1:30:32] <+chiazam> Racism DOES run in the family
[1:30:33] <DatAsuna> Fun fact: medals started being given out far more often because they realised soldiers don't complain about their pay as much when they're decorated so you can stiff then on the bonuses they used to get.
[1:30:34] <StoopKid241> Turns out Pressly was the space racist all along
[1:30:38] <%dekkitout> But mass relay go brrr?
[1:30:40] <%blutzwavedave> Pressly, tell me about your sexual organs
[1:30:42] <SaltyAzteca> "You could just talk"
[1:30:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[1:30:43] <+necrocannibal2> SEE, SPACE RACISM IS CORRECT
[1:30:44] <%troubled_ginger> Ah yes, "traditionalism"
[1:30:46] <stantheman_97> justified space racism
[1:30:46] <%sporeian94> Unless you read the comics then it's secretly about a reaper artifact and the illusive man
[1:30:48] <kasteni> Like children playing with a gun
[1:30:48] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Turians are Space Cops and suck
[1:30:49] <willyfreshness> so i started blastin
[1:30:50] <+eanscrale> Monkey bad
[1:30:50] <%NovaKnightmare> Space Racism is justified
[1:30:54] <Goraka91> If they didn't want to be shot they shouldn't of entered our cone of vision
[1:30:54] <%Mr_Pylon> A bit less tragic and stupid than the B5 first contact war
[1:30:58] <%Teyaric> And humans are REMARKABLY capable in the war, it's worth noting.
[1:30:58] <%AncelDeLambert> IT WAS ONLY THIRTY YEARS
[1:30:59] <%cvp5127> "they shot first"
[1:31:00] <murdocismyhero> Is sheapord space jesus
[1:31:02] <+athuramn> well, mismanagement of a mass relay could destroy galaxies
[1:31:02] <%QueequegTheater> Big racis,
[1:31:03] <T_Sasquatch> Turians shot first LUL
[1:31:04] <spuginky> spacism
[1:31:05] <+babyacid> no ship has a better intro than the Normandy 2
[1:31:05] <rcand9> "stop fucking around you clowns" is what they say
[1:31:10] <ARDM112> It also turned out Turians don't believe in "civilians" as a concept and will just bomb anyone
[1:31:11] <Halospaz117> But I wannnaaaaa
[1:31:15] <+titansloth93> Kinda like still being mad at the Japanese in the 70s
[1:31:17] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> i keep forgetting that humanity is still mostly new to space
[1:31:17] <+eanscrale> But they look SO cool
[1:31:22] <$Wurmspawn> 30 years = long time ago. Hear that Pat? THIRTY years. LONG. TIME. AGO.
[1:31:25] <Thepothero> Bird racist s rooWut
[1:31:26] <%Ravioli_Ronin> 30 years isn’t that long LUL
[1:31:27] <TrollKing96> Area 51 but no warning shots, just kill shots.
[1:31:29] <Savior127> Why does Pressly's mouth look like Adam Sandler's Little Nickie?
[1:31:29] <StoopKid241> I mean in his defense, 30 years is not a long time ago for that
[1:31:30] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt My favorite part of the war is humans start user carrier ships and the Turians freak out
[1:31:30] <rcand9> shepard loves heavy action
[1:31:35] <rcand9> he does suck
[1:31:35] <+Midashu> Good luck, SON
[1:31:35] <ScreamLord> 30 years isn't THAT long considering the Turians were trying to genocide us
[1:31:36] <%QueequegTheater> *using
[1:31:37] <%scaryboisupreme> but turians are hot that excuses everything
[1:31:37] <%sporeian94> OH come on he comes around

[1:40:00] <%Breedofevil> @PatStaresAt was it called eden prime when we got there or did we name it that after it became fuckin sick
[1:40:01] <%dekkitout> I hate it when games do that

[1:40:23] <SaltyAzteca> Ramirez!
[1:40:23] <%blutzwavedave> [GLASS HIM]
[1:40:24] <+AmericanSkidd> Some arn't even real choices
[1:40:26] <%AncelDeLambert> this was neat when this game came out, because it was the first time it had been done. And then EVERYONE started doing it
[1:40:27] <+black_pariah> "I aint nobody's fourth ghostbuster!"
[1:40:28] <nobody287> how much does a mod that shows the actual dialogue ruin this game?
[1:40:29] <$Wurmspawn> That's the one thing I HATE about the convo wheel.
[1:40:33] <%bugz_munny> This game poisoned so many games
[1:40:34] <%MrBorisMakarov> AND I NEED TO KNOW
[1:40:34] <Solvari> PROTEIN?

[1:50:53] <+Alopekis> It looks really good compared to the original
[1:50:53] <+CptBritches> What a good boy
[1:50:53] <%walternatorz> looks like they fixed the sprint motion blur
[1:50:54] <%bread_assassin> Well, you’re not wearing armor.
[1:50:55] <%s1rcuit> that's something that bothers me all the time, these badass military types with sprint distances so short that a lardass like me could out-do
[1:50:57] <generalve> @patstaresat  not until the 3rd game they give you unlimited Sprint :(
[1:50:59] <+cdmanjak> Oh god the gameplay
[1:51:00] <%QueequegTheater> 1 was the game that needed the remaster the most
[1:51:00] <+AmericanSkidd> it looks way better
[1:51:01] <%Monkeyweed21> its a good remaster overall
[1:51:01] <Goraka91> It's nice, but some of the mood lighting is drastically different
[1:51:03] <Halospaz117> I miss the blood red sky
[1:51:04] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Jenkins is still alive???????????????????????????????????????????? We're 2 hours into the stream

[2:00:55] <%Ynkubus_> Bin or compost

[2:07:41] <+Alopekis> There's a couple scenes when you don't use it
[2:07:41] <knight_verse> Kaidan is boring as sin and is a Council apologist.
[2:07:42] <+SataruYamate> sheperrd is canonically a soldier
[2:07:43] <+FelIian> Yup
[2:07:43] <+ScottishMadJacko> Sometimes its pistol weirdly
[2:07:43] <%scaryboisupreme> They glide as softly as a cloud
[2:07:43] <Grandnatics> You always could, they would just SUCK to use
[2:07:45] <%sporeian94> yeah in 2 and 3 you will get default guns in cutscenes
[2:07:50] <$Wurmspawn> In Mass Effect 1 you ALWAYS had the ability to use all weapons.
[2:07:51] <CrypticMochi> Didn’t they only remove it for more serious scenes?
[2:07:52] <+FelIian> Happens in ME2 as well
[2:07:53] <Lee_The_Limey> She abandoned the nerds too
[2:07:55] <AmuserName> Yep. That default assault rifle broke immersion ALL the time.
[2:07:56] <AthenaAegis> She would like to see the Geth's manager
[2:07:56] <+athuramn> @sirgo0se uh...
[2:08:00] <+teh_rawk> nah original you could equip everything you were just bad at every gun you didnt specialize in
[2:08:01] <%scaryboisupreme> Is there a chance the track might bend?
[2:08:03] <+Extrallent> you could equip them. you just couldn't aim down sights
[2:08:09] <%Cykron> In a warzone you're always supposed to hold your rifle
[2:08:09] <%scaryboisupreme> Not on your life my hindu friend!
[2:08:14] <Halospaz117> @Wurmspawn you could use them but had no skills for certain ones (except for soldier)
[2:08:15] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I like ME3 Ashley the most because I have a bimbo fetish
[2:08:18] <%SirGO0SE> @athuramn no do tell, im behind
[2:08:20] <%ironohki> FOR NOW
[2:08:22] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT THAT SHIT GRIN
[2:08:23] <%POUND_CAKE94> Yeah they’d aim like garbage if you had the wrong class
[2:08:31] <+Alopekis> I'm pretty sure you could always use all weapons. You'd just be shit with certain ones based on your class.
[2:08:33] <%toastybites> thats fair
[2:08:34] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL
[2:08:36] <%spoiledbadger> they're all the same to her huh?
[2:08:36] <+Sleepy_Puma> Bimbofication

[2:08:41] <SaltyAzteca> Really!
[2:08:41] <+AmericanSkidd> yup
[2:08:42] <+necrocannibal2> if you have a bimbo fetish I recommend looking for God
[2:08:42] <thelonechris> LUL
[2:08:42] <%pokefan9956> WHAT
[2:08:42] <%ComradeConquistador> YEAH
[2:08:42] <+red_cuppa> damn
[2:08:43] <DatAsuna> Garrus can kill her for you too
[2:08:43] <knight_verse> Kaidan literally tells you that the council did nothing wrong.
[2:08:43] <%scaryboisupreme> What about us brain dead slobs?
[2:08:43] <+ScottishMadJacko> You can shoot her
[2:08:43] <Broken_Sonex> FAIR
[2:08:45] <%JoshManVGH> Whaaaaat?
[2:08:45] <deviljhojho_> really PogChamp
[2:08:46] <+FelIian> YUP
[2:08:48] <CorruptDropbear> WHAT
[2:08:49] <+glgzephyr> LUUL
[2:08:49] <+JaseAdrift> I NEED TO KNOW
[2:08:50] <%ironohki> I'm sure it's fine.
[2:08:50] <%scaryboisupreme> You'll be given cushy jobs!
[2:08:50] <$Wurmspawn> @Halospaz117 I know, I was correctly Pat's crazy talk saying that you couldn't use those weapons in ME1 og.
[2:08:51] <%ultra_homo> yeah u can shoot her
[2:08:52] <%ultra_homo> real good
[2:08:53] <Ipsenscastle> I guess we're nuking Kaiden then
[2:08:53] <%Varlinator> Yeah you can :)
[2:08:53] <%toastybites> @JaseAdrift you have to save her in 1 though
[2:08:54] <+ScottishMadJacko> Its the best
[2:08:54] <+curse85> Ashley is way better in 3
[2:08:55] <mak0t0yukii> Whaaaat for real
[2:08:55] <+Eiiriika> I like ME3 Ashley because she gets her head slammed into paste!
[2:08:56] <+FelIian> Shoot her dead
[2:08:57] <nevan_44> YEEEEEAH
[2:08:57] <Solvari> Yeah you can kill her in ME3 afaik
[2:08:57] <%POUND_CAKE94> psaUp
[2:08:58] <%NovaKnightmare> YOU FOOL
[2:08:58] <+zajoestar> reset
[2:08:59] <deviljhojho_> embarassing
[2:09:00] <%QueequegTheater> I actually do like her more than most people do
[2:09:00] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU CAN KILL ALOT OF PEOPLE YOURSELF IF YOU WAIT
[2:09:01] <%ironohki> Worth it
[2:09:01] <%scaryboisupreme> The ring came off my pudding can
[2:09:01] <DatAsuna> If you don't pick EITHER Option and just time it out, Garrus kills her.
[2:09:01] <%AzureGale> Oh noes
[2:09:01] <Goraka91> @JaseAdrift Renegade can kill Ashley/Kaiden yes
[2:09:02] <+athuramn> I thought everyone knew that
[2:09:03] <%walternatorz> EVIL
[2:09:03] <Ids560> just max out both
[2:09:03] <thelonechris> Renegade cause you were mean
[2:09:04] <+Alopekis> Paragon run ruined
[2:09:04] <Solvari> at least thats were i killed her
[2:09:04] <%spoiledbadger> oh well
[2:09:05] <stormhawk9891> Ohhh nooooooo
[2:09:05] <%maenos2> the udina thing in the citadel, folks, that's how
[2:09:06] <%scaryboisupreme> take my pen knife my good man!
[2:09:08] <+chiazam> Why do people hate Ashley?
[2:09:08] <Ipsenscastle> you always were because of your origin
[2:09:10] <%pokefan9956> keep her alive so you can kill her
[2:09:10] <LluthyY> yeah during a standoff lol
[2:09:11] <+FelIian> Bioware, can we have Nihlus back? We'll give you Ash in exchange @PatStaresAt
[2:09:11] <+teh_rawk> better kiss ashley to raise that paragon
[2:09:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Paragon is boring
[2:09:13] <+reinbachthe3rd> Being mean to Ashley is always the right choice.
[2:09:18] <mak0t0yukii> PAT YOU'RE BEING A BUTT
[2:09:18] <%sporeian94> Barrier and First Aid
[2:09:19] <+JaseAdrift> THATS SO WORTH IT
[2:09:21] <%sporeian94> Unlock the skills
[2:09:22] <%skeleklng> Renegade is objectively the one true way of playing SHEPARD
[2:09:23] <+cdmanjak> RENEGADE FO LYFE
[2:09:24] <+ghostfaceninja_> JUST PRESS Y
[2:09:25] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You can ice her personally, it's worth keeping her alive if you go  all in renegade for that moment
[2:09:25] <+Calek> level up their powers
[2:09:25] <+glgzephyr> that's good generaly
[2:09:26] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt take Ash's helmet so she can get shot
[2:09:26] <Dunmarkh> that probably works
[2:09:26] <+athuramn> you get rewarded a lot for being a cunt to ashley
[2:09:27] <+Alopekis> Level decryption and electronics
[2:09:28] <stormhawk9891> Electronics and Decryption always
[2:09:30] <Dfreddy8> You played yourself
[2:09:31] <%sporeian94> Just go evenly or push for skills
[2:09:34] <+ScottishMadJacko> Class first then skills personally
[2:09:36] <tattleworm> if i remember right you always want someone with decryption and electronics
[2:09:36] <buhbuhboat> rush electronics and decryption
[2:09:37] <Grandnatics> Get their Electronics up
[2:09:38] <%Monkeyweed21> does it even matter lol
[2:09:38] <+Alopekis> Yeah
[2:09:39] <%walternatorz> I always level up the decryption to hack stuff
[2:09:40] <+teh_rawk> you want decryption and electronics if theyre available
[2:09:41] <dd44dostivei> level decryption
[2:09:43] <%legend_of_nolan> save them up, you might need them at the final boss!
[2:09:44] <+AmericanSkidd> to loot shit
[2:09:44] <Grandnatics> They make the Mako Immortal
[2:09:45] <Pyrowire> In my eyes the perfect scheme is romance Ashley in the first game and leave her for an alien in the second and third game
[2:09:45] <%purps26> I always just autoleveled them
[2:09:47] <+Alopekis> They're really useful for planet missions
[2:09:49] <%Varlinator> The circles are new skills
[2:09:49] <+Calek> are you even going to use Kaidan
[2:09:49] <%bread_assassin> You're gonna NEED someone with maxed decryption and electronics with you to unlock shit
[2:09:49] <%VioletHeart> Electronics and decryption for hacking and opening chests and doors and stuff.
[2:09:50] <+imspacingout> i just it auto i dont feel like it matters on normal
[2:09:51] <buhbuhboat> let you open more crates get more loot
[2:09:52] <Ipsenscastle> you level up the skills you want to use, except you set them to auto so i guess who even cares
[2:09:54] <+glgzephyr> lots of geth fights in this game
[2:09:54] <%toastybites> honestly just wait till Tali
[2:09:54] <+Calek> yes
[2:09:55] <ape_hawk> no
[2:09:56] <%QueequegTheater> It lets you pick locks
[2:09:57] <%sporeian94> Yeah
[2:10:00] <+SataruYamate> just decryption on Tali so she can hack everything for you, and singularity on liara because you dont have it
[2:10:01] <%Teyaric> LOCKPICK SKILLS.
[2:10:01] <+teh_rawk> its more for unlocking chests
[2:10:03] <dd44dostivei> OPEN CONTAINERS
[2:10:05] <+teh_rawk> no
[2:10:05] <+athuramn> you want them to be leveled to what you're bad at @patstaresat . and no
[2:10:05] <%twistedj3ster> sure why not
[2:10:06] <%CalderGaming> @chiazam she's the xenophobe in a game and genre that most players are interested in because they LIKE aliens
[2:10:07] <%ExpressNode> You can save then try it
[2:10:07] <%sunsetdisc0> i never understood why people don't really like kaidan. hes basically that dorky kid next door that you played with growing up who always had a crush on you
[2:10:07] <+reinbachthe3rd> @Pyrowire The ol' double whammy.
[2:10:07] <Louie_Salmon> yes immediately followed by no, great
[2:10:08] <%POUND_CAKE94> It’ll help you get more stuff
[2:10:11] <%Monkeyweed21> you want to focus on utility skills for party members
[2:10:18] <ape_hawk> oh god, decryption
[2:10:18] <%Varlinator> Electronics are ALWAYS good
[2:10:18] <El_GhostV1> Doesn’t eartborn give you insta renegade pints?
[2:10:19] <$Wurmspawn> Typically I level Electronics and Decrypt always, then unlock all skills with a focus on class focus.
[2:10:25] <+glgzephyr> he's not staying LUL
[2:10:25] <trueGarnish> LUL
[2:10:26] <+AmericanSkidd> yeah...

[2:10:37] <+JaseAdrift> Because you INSTANTLY switch them out
[2:10:38] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Electronics and Decryption so you can unlock chest and doors
[2:10:39] <jbrachob> lol
[2:10:39] <srv4254> humans suck

[2:10:45] <Goraka91> @CalderGaming To be fair the Turians are assholes
[2:10:45] <%NovaKnightmare> NO HUMMIES
[2:10:45] <buhbuhboat> since your not playing a class with tech you'll need a squadmate with decryption and electronics to open alot of crates and doors
[2:10:45] <+Alopekis> Tali and Garrus
[2:10:45] <+glgzephyr> THAT'S CORRECT
[2:10:46] <%YakumoYomi> FAIR
[2:10:46] <pancake_madness> Das racist

[2:11:11] <+YabbaTroll> Pat would be a Volus 300%
[2:11:11] <feralspidey> BibleThump traitor to his own species
[2:11:11] <Ids560> fuck I'd even play a batarian
[2:11:11] <Archmortal> QUARIAN ALL THE WAY
[2:11:11] <+Alopekis> I would 100% play an ME game as a Turian if I had the option. Would be so cool.
[2:11:12] <+crimson_echidna> Miranda is the best party member in ME2 though lol
[2:11:14] <+zajoestar> JACK?!

[2:11:16] <$renegade_blade> I usually go with Tali and Garrus
[2:11:16] <%RetroCop87> Pat, you already ARE a Krogan
[2:11:16] <%POUND_CAKE94> That’d be so cool
[2:11:18] <%spoiledbadger> the fact that tali or garrus can't be romancable in the first game SUCKS
[2:11:18] <+JaseAdrift> Wait Jack gets on the team though

[2:12:33] <+red_cuppa> i like joker
[2:12:34] <%scaryboisupreme> Jacks cool in ME3
[2:12:35] <thetunnelhomer> Jack is great.
[2:12:35] <%maenos2> vega's kinda nice.  he's a meathead but a good boy
[2:12:36] <%Raiden_Breaker> oh
[2:12:36] <trueGarnish> edge lord
[2:12:37] <%sporeian94> Jack's fine
[2:12:37] <+ScottishMadJacko> Oh really?
[2:12:38] <pancake_madness> Jack is great in 3
[2:12:38] <%NovaKnightmare> Jack feels super try hardy
[2:12:39] <+zajoestar> Cringe
[2:12:41] <%VioletHeart> I also dislike Jack. Vega's cool though.
[2:12:42] <+JaseAdrift> WHAT
[2:12:42] <Goraka91> Jack is a massive asshole, who gets better in 3
[2:12:42] <Hellarussian> thats a hot take
[2:12:44] <%ComradeConquistador> Jack is too tryhard for my taste.
[2:12:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Alopekis False, he's not great.
[2:12:46] <Blank9> vega is inoffensive but not good
[2:12:47] <+YabbaTroll> Yeah you either love her or hate her
[2:12:48] <+teh_rawk> jacks ok
[2:12:48] <deviljhojho_> Sorry brother, humans are just not getting in, tattoo or not
[2:12:50] <Ids560> Vega's fine
[2:12:51] <%POUND_CAKE94> Zaeed is gr8
[2:12:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HERESY
[2:12:51] <+Calek> I maxed out money in ME1 and couldn't sell anything anymore yet there was nothing to buy
[2:12:51] <$TheCynicalSeth> I love jack
[2:12:51] <+GobbleLynn> It's ok Pat; we know you're wrong
[2:12:52] <%toastybites> actual hot take
[2:12:52] <Justlaxy> Jack is a not a good person but she is cool.
[2:12:53] <feralspidey> i disliker her "outfit"
[2:12:53] <willyfreshness> jacks way cooler in 3 than 2
[2:12:53] <+zajoestar> HOTTEST TAKE
[2:12:55] <%ironohki> I remember realizing I was going down Jack's romance path and ABORT ABORT NO NO ABORT NOW PULL OUT.
[2:12:56] <Fanimusmaximus> Jack’s a bitch so that makes sense to hate her
[2:12:56] <+FelIian> @scaryboisupreme shame it's like the best light armor for a LONG time
[2:12:57] <%Noir_Valdr> Pat's gonna have a loooot of takes in this series that people are gonna either love or hate.
[2:12:57] <%condemned_15> what about Kasumi?
[2:12:59] <Broken_Sonex> She's SUCH a tryhard
[2:13:00] <+ScottishMadJacko> Jack is tryharding, thats the point
[2:13:00] <+Alopekis> @Sigma_190_Beta Yeah, but he's neat
[2:13:00] <%Raiden_Breaker> ME3 is has character devolpment
[2:13:00] <%MisterRockett> They tried way too hard with Jack. Very much a "I asked for a NORMAL straw" type.
[2:13:01] <%Garthunox> can you explain that a bit?
[2:13:03] <TheSphereHunter> 684 raiders from TheSphereHunter have joined! 
[2:13:04] <dd44dostivei> jack is a mass murderer, tbf. but so is shepard
[2:13:06] <%QueequegTheater> Vega is peak himbo hours
[2:13:06] <+alphonseisbest> JACK IS GREAT in 3 pat :P
[2:13:07] <Sunstalker> I like Jack. She's just a Angeline Jolie proxy
[2:13:07] <Blank9> kasumi is better than jack
[2:13:09] <+Alopekis> Oh shit
[2:13:10] <%saadi90> Jack’s loyalty mission was cool
[2:13:11] <trueGarnish> LUL
[2:13:13] <no123450n> POP
[2:13:13] <+JaseAdrift> The wosrst thing about jack is her outfits
[2:13:13] <SaltyAzteca> ITS SO GOOD
[2:13:13] <%YakumoYomi> Kappa
[2:13:16] <%Breedofevil> *bap*
[2:13:16] <+athuramn> spells don't curve in this game btw @patstaresat
[2:13:16] <+Alopekis> It's Pat's rival
[2:13:19] <hat_under_bread> Man, those 2007 animations really had impact
[2:13:21] <Dunmarkh> that's pretty good
[2:13:22] <tubit> lol
[2:13:22] <bonebagMEL> wow
[2:13:24] <DianaTheAscian> bruh
[2:13:24] <%Order_of_Mystery> Order_of_Mystery subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! Happy 22 months, Pat! My sincerest thanks for the years of entertainment! (Sorry if you've been asked this already) So, who is your favorite and second favorite squadmates in the Mass Effect series? Also, do you think Mass Effect 4 will be any good?
[2:13:25] <%psidefx> bodied... how
[2:13:27] <%MidnightBurst12> looks so janky
[2:13:28] <+chiazam> That melee sucks
[2:13:28] <LluthyY> sick moves
[2:13:28] <%scaryboisupreme> ME2 actually forces me to switch out teammates
[2:13:28] <Goraka91> LUL
[2:13:29] <+Photonicfab> thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB
[2:13:29] <%Monkeyweed21> MELEE SUCKS IN 1 AND 2
[2:13:31] <%psidefx> NICE
[2:13:31] <%twistedj3ster> stepped out for a minute, did Pat talk shit on Jack?
[2:13:32] <+JaseAdrift> HUH
[2:13:33] <+glgzephyr> ??????
[2:13:33] <Solvari> p2w
[2:13:35] <Ipsenscastle> melee gets way better through the series
[2:13:35] <TourettesPlays> Pat the powers menu is broken and doesnt activate the power you select most of the time
[2:13:35] <ergulor> legendary
[2:13:35] <%Breedofevil> because you can GAME
[2:13:36] <%sporeian94> Yeah double points because there's only 30 levels instead of 60
[2:13:36] <Fanimusmaximus> Ehh
[2:13:37] <%3d_pbandj> woof, I though Mass Effect 1 got made better.
[2:13:37] <+Midashu> legendary mode
[2:13:38] <+SataruYamate> legendary edition level ups
[2:13:38] <%Dunsparcetheglare> they changed the leveling
[2:13:38] <%RageCasanova> legendary progression system
[2:13:39] <+ScottishMadJacko> Legendary levelling
[2:13:39] <zanderwitch42> WHAT HAPPENED
[2:13:39] <%DOLLACROSS> thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB
[2:13:41] <%ArcanumArcanum> Because it's 1-30 instead of 1-60
[2:13:41] <%cvp5127> legendary scaling
[2:13:42] <+Alopekis> Did you go with the new level system?
[2:13:43] <tomspartant99> less as game goes on
[2:13:43] <+ScottishMadJacko> It was a n option
[2:13:43] <+teh_rawk> the level cap is 30 now
[2:13:43] <+Calek> Because Legendary
[2:13:43] <%scaryboisupreme> Me2 is always Garrus and Tali or Kasumi and Legion
[2:13:44] <Centaur_field> Legendary leveling mode
[2:13:45] <$TheCynicalSeth> honestly i'm not a fan of Miranda
[2:13:45] <%Bmrandfriends> quit bitchin
[2:13:46] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt You level twice as fast with legendary scaling
[2:13:47] <%ComradeConquistador> Points add up fast in this one.
[2:13:47] <+HefestoForges> wtf
[2:13:47] <%JoshManVGH> Legendary Leveling Baby @patstaresat
[2:13:47] <+Peacefrog7> its the new level system
[2:13:49] <+Midashu> caps at 30 instead of 60
[2:13:50] <%wibbwobbler> Raided lol
[2:13:51] <tanarath> Pat Shepard
[2:13:51] <%Varlinator> @PatStaresAt You're on Legendary leveling system
[2:13:52] <+FelIian> because Legendary Edition is half level, so double scaling
[2:13:53] <%Monkeyweed21> ME3 makes melee actually good
[2:13:54] <+Alopekis> Yeah. You can change it to the original if you want.
[2:13:56] <%StormBuster24> psaJpeg
[2:13:56] <Ipsenscastle> you selected the legendary level option
[2:13:57] <%evilmagetim> New leveling system
[2:13:58] <Archmortal> Legenday level scaling cuts max to 30 and doubles your points per level
[2:14:01] <+NaomiLing> is that pats and paige's future child
[2:14:03] <+D00msDayDan> Does legendary give you enough points to max everything out?
[2:14:04] <%RageCasanova> yee they squashed the lvl cap so it was more likely to be max level in one playthrough
[2:14:04] <Justlaxy> You can go back to the OG but umm.
[2:14:06] <+AmericanSkidd> Cap is 30 so double the points
[2:14:06] <Grandnatics> Lift is broken
[2:14:06] <dd44dostivei> cap is 30 instead of 60
[2:14:07] <tanarath> Nice, Adept
[2:14:08] <+Peacefrog7> basically halves the cap so you get double the points
[2:14:11] <TourettesPlays> Barrier is fucking GAMEBREAKING Pat
[2:14:11] <%Breedofevil> so is sheperd psychic or are these suit powers
[2:14:12] <%evilmagetim> 30 is cap instead of 60
[2:14:15] <geosspone> legendary mode does double points per level but cap of level 30
[2:14:16] <+FelIian> oh yea there's no charge in ME1
[2:14:16] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Legendary Leveling makes the level cap 30 like the other two games
[2:14:19] <+zajoestar> you can change it to classic lvling
[2:14:19] <Broken_Sonex> @TheCynicalSeth I can imagine why and that's wrong
[2:14:23] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> There's a reason the melee achievement tops out at 100 kills with melee
[2:14:25] <trueGarnish> vanguard for super sanic!
[2:14:25] <%wibbwobbler> Sphere hunter just raided
[2:14:27] <DodgeJohnson> You get less skill points per level later on, it's just how ME levelling works
[2:14:28] <Hellarussian> lift is dank
[2:14:28] <Sunstalker> Breedofevil Biotic implants
[2:14:30] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Are there any human party members you like?

[2:14:42] <+FelIian> Barrier is OP OP
[2:14:43] <TourettesPlays> They made the Marksman ability so much worse
[2:14:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Throw and Lift are the best powers in 1 @PatStaresAt
[2:14:46] <+glgzephyr> Warp is dank
[2:14:46] <+HefestoForges> VF5 showdown when
[2:14:49] <%legend_of_nolan> So no Street Fighter 5?

[2:14:51] <CrypticMochi> Master lift can pick up a geth colossus
[2:14:52] <+FelIian> basically can't die later on
[2:14:55] <%SABiscotti> Lift is still legit one of the best spells in the game
[2:14:56] <shotgang86> So what do you think its stronger Tech or Biotic?
[2:15:05] <Goraka91> Reminder that Jacob is literally the worst
[2:15:07] <+AmericanSkidd> Zaeed is pretty cool
[2:15:08] <Grandnatics> Barrier makes you unkillable
[2:15:13] <tanarath> @thespherehunter psyched for pat totes winning no prob in vf5?

[2:15:24] <+ScottishMadJacko> Capped at current level
[2:15:35] <+gespenst25> Which game has the best biotics @PatStaresAt ?
[2:15:36] <$Wurmspawn> Abilities have progressive level caps.
[2:15:37] <+glgzephyr> unlock shotguns is high priority when possible
[2:15:39] <ammobasket> Hello @Random_ass_hero
[2:15:39] <Broken_Sonex> Hey yeah, Kasumi is and Zaeed are also cool humans

[2:16:15] <%Varlinator> ABS
[2:16:16] <+ScottishMadJacko> You get 40 slots on ps
[2:16:18] <thetunnelhomer> Ashley is just terrible all around.

[2:16:20] <ghostofsolomon> LEVEL HER UP PATTT
[2:16:20] <Draco_Renegade> Ashley more like Trashley
[2:16:21] <%psidefx> aegis reflector
[2:16:26] <Grandnatics> You have to check the wheel
[2:16:27] <%Order_of_Mystery> I'm guessing Pat is making Kaiden the skillmonkey, and ignoring the future charred corpse of Ash
[2:16:28] <%sunsetdisc0> is twitch being fucky for anyone else?
[2:16:30] <Grandnatics> EVERY TIME
[2:16:31] <%Monkeyweed21> you cant in 1
[2:16:31] <+AmericanSkidd> you dont
[2:16:36] <+JaseAdrift> you look at the wheel
[2:16:37] <%sporeian94> Pat it's PC prioritized, so you are suppose to see it on the hotbar
[2:16:37] <Broken_Sonex> @FelIian Not nearly as much as Jack
[2:16:39] <%Varlinator> only way is to check the wheel
[2:16:40] <shotgang86> Man remember that this game made the Xbox be called by Fox News as "The seXBox"?
[2:16:44] <+ScottishMadJacko> yup
[2:16:46] <%sporeian94> but if you are playing on console you have to check wheel
[2:16:49] <+JaseAdrift> that wheel is you new best friend...
[2:16:49] <AmuserName> PC controls, you can see hotbar.
[2:16:57] <+D00msDayDan> If you were playing KBM you’d have a hotbar
[2:16:57] <+CookieCutter007> no hotbar FeelsBadMan
[2:17:00] <%Monkeyweed21> ME1 is made for keyboard and hotbars
[2:17:01] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Goraka91 doesn't he ditch your ass if you romance him in 2?
[2:17:02] <+FelIian> you can on KB+M, there is quickslots at the top of the screen
[2:17:09] <%afronooch> singularity is ez mode
[2:17:10] <wasdsf> DA SHOTGUN
[2:17:12] <+gespenst25> Didn't ME1 used to have a real UI?
[2:17:13] <TourettesPlays> they improved basically nothing for LE and actually ruined a lot of things
[2:17:14] <Goraka91> @Order_of_Mystery Sure does
[2:17:17] <+AmericanSkidd> no, you mean goo
[2:17:23] <Broken_Sonex> @Goraka91 SURE DOES

[2:19:23] <+Buzzkill983> Ain't no party like a husk party
[2:19:26] <$Wurmspawn> Y'know. I've got a question. Besides the answer being, "Becuase then the game wouldn't happen," Why didn't Saren blow up the Beacon after using it?
[2:19:28] <venny_doe> oh lawd he runnin
[2:19:30] <tubit> Space Borgs!
[2:19:30] <+D00msDayDan> The domestic abuse is coming out on stream since Paige has been gone for so long

[2:37:13] <TomFrancis_> ashley sucks
[2:37:18] <+Qexec> It was always weird how judgemental they are of a normal dude for not fighting the Geth.
[2:37:18] <+JaseAdrift> free shit
[2:37:22] <StaticEntry> ashley set her authority to 10 and rhetoric to -5
[2:37:25] <dd44dostivei> paragon is as much of a dick as renegade
[2:37:27] <one_punman> paragon of give me stuff
[2:37:29] <%Monkeyweed21> cole?
[2:37:30] <+HefestoForges> @EASrake I like ASS
[2:37:30] <%QueequegTheater> I mean, this is a guy literally stealing weapons during a raid, is being mad at him really a bad thing
[2:37:31] <SaltyAzteca> Shepat Commander
[2:37:34] <%W1nterTitan> Shepard Commander.
[2:37:35] <+athuramn> imagine if that attack option was on the right side of the wheel
[2:37:35] <ape_hawk> geth are basically Space Slaves, pat
[2:37:37] <Sunstalker> Sometimes you gotta shake the husk tree to see what falls out kinamaLUL
[2:37:43] <+AmericanSkidd> Paragon of Pay Me
[2:37:49] <+JaseAdrift> Ashley put all her points into Authority
[2:37:54] <%Alazull> @patstaresat I'm glad you like cooler Borg
[2:37:55] <+necrocannibal2> @QueequegTheater yeah, that's what I mean
[2:37:59] <+necrocannibal2> BUT A RAID COULD HAPPEN
[2:38:01] <%QueequegTheater> But he's also now trying to keep them
[2:38:02] <+curse85> is it because ashley is a racist? no wat speciest? idk fuck her poetry though
[2:38:02] <+necrocannibal2> THAT'S WHY THERE WERE WEAPONS
[2:38:04] <+Promessa_EX> Yeah but it happened
[2:38:04] <ianabstract> Stealing from the military is always cool
[2:38:07] <+red_cuppa> a raid he didn't know about
[2:38:11] <%LouieRouie> Shepard should be sympathetic to a fellow sole survivor
[2:38:12] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat The US military is considered un auditable so really missing gernades are not really an issue in the large scheme of things
[2:38:15] <+Promessa_EX> He should feel bad
[2:38:19] <%NovaKnightmare> Ashley is being aggro at a guy who woke up during an alien attack, there's way worse people to be aggro at
[2:38:33] <%Birdigalore> The Reaper roar is so cool
[2:38:33] <+athuramn> are we forgetting he was stealing for months

[2:39:31] <%Rumbutt> So we're calling Paragon points "Narc Points" and Renegade points "Space Racist Points" right?
[2:39:36] <%Puhff> catJAM
[2:39:37] <Sunstalker> athuramn Maybe the fucking military, should be able to notice that their shit goes missing and look into it, during all those months LUL
[2:39:40] <+Promessa_EX> I think some people just want to see the poor person as being good even though they are doing crimes that screw people over
[2:39:48] <Basch71> giving assault rifles DoT damage was great
[2:39:51] <StaticEntry> those geth be schmoovin
[2:39:56] <ianabstract> I remember maxing out weapon force with a shotgun and ragdolling enemies off the map

[2:40:25] <Goraka91> I'd say Mass Effect lost it's unique musical identity when they got big name musicians for 2 and 3, ooh a piano and drums never heard that before
[2:40:26] <Deasmeister> Spracist
[2:40:26] <+athuramn> "secret points"
[2:40:27] <+PenmanLupine> instead of Space Racist how about Space Cop. it's the same thing

[2:41:16] <AmuserName> NO SWAY + NOW THEY HEADSHOP
[2:41:17] <+JaseAdrift> Literally no sway
[2:41:19] <%walternatorz> I would like to see a side by side comparison between Pat's and Paige's playthroughs here
[2:41:20] <%scaryboisupreme> THE FINGER OF GOD
[2:41:20] <Basch71> is actually good
[2:41:21] <$ComfortableStranger> i said that!!!
[2:41:22] <%Treuan> Spacist
[2:41:22] <AmuserName> *HEADSHOT
[2:41:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Infiltrator is busted now
[2:41:24] <alwayspronking> LUL
[2:41:25] <r00T17> oh yeah snipers are busted in tis version
[2:41:27] <%Birdigalore> RUSH THE STAGE
[2:41:29] <thetunnelhomer> I wonder how powerful Sniper rifles are at max ranks.
[2:41:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUO
[2:41:31] <%emperordread> It's not racism if the aliens are a hive mind though
[2:41:36] <%Noir_Valdr> @PatStaresAt now imagine the infiltrator who actually gets damage buffs on the sniper actually being viable!
[2:41:37] <+Belasteris> They were terribly unusable without training in the original.
[2:41:39] <%sporeian94> not gonna work
[2:41:42] <iosephe> THE SPACE WAR STARTS NOW
[2:41:54] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> I mean you're a narc either way, so it's kinda literally good/bad cop points
[2:41:57] <%Varlinator> Snipers have defo seen the biggest improvements. So happy I chose to run Infiltrator this time around
[2:41:58] <Goraka91> I like how even the medigel looks like it's dancing
[2:42:01] <tanarath> Infil was already busted, you could go full immune to everything with it before
[2:42:06] <%troubled_ginger> I like trains
[2:42:08] <%sunsetdisc0> im just hoping the geth shottie is still broken in me2
[2:42:12] <+xiidrifty> you think that they made the gameplay upgrades to this game the way they are so we could get by it as quick as possible??
[2:42:13] <+athuramn> just remember that when you asked chat, 50% voted on this terrible class
[2:42:17] <%ComradeConquistador> I LIKE TRAINS
[2:42:23] <rudybrossard> Where's Paige ?
[2:42:25] <MagmaRam> @Belasteris even with training they were extremely weird, I had the most success using them close up for knockdown in the original
[2:42:26] <%Monkeyweed21> HE HAS A BIG ROBO ARM FFS
[2:42:36] <%Rumbutt> No evidence... other than the smoking crater...? pretty big give away Saren
[2:42:36] <ape_hawk> hey saren, you got something on your face
[2:42:37] <StaticEntry> hes like a tech-mummy
[2:42:37] <Corgifist> @Varlinator Yeah, you don't sway like you've been drinking for 12 hours straight while aiming a Sniper now
[2:42:39] <CorruptDropbear> 'leave no evidence' *looks at humans on poles*
[2:42:42] <Goraka91> @athuramn Every class was awful in 1
[2:42:43] <aiutare47> infil was always the best class, get-out-of-jail-free card. Damage boost card. Instakill button. Shield melt button.
[2:42:44] <%NovaKnightmare> Because FFX2 and FF7Remake both imply FFX is actually a long prequel to FF7 and the founder of Shinra was an Al Bhed, does that mean Wakka was right?
[2:42:44] <%valriot> SourPls
[2:42:44] <Archmortal> At least Vanguard isn't as bad as Sentinel
[2:42:45] <DianaTheAscian> wa
[2:42:45] <+AmericanSkidd> Destroy the ENTIRE COLONY with these like 5 bombs
[2:42:46] <%scaryboisupreme> yeah Noveria music
[2:42:47] <+vaderxyz1970> Look at this clearly sci fi sephoroth
[2:42:51] <iosephe> 2008
[2:42:52] <Solvari> LUL
[2:42:56] <Broken_Sonex> Saren is so fucking cool
[2:42:56] <Grandnatics> They are always A-posing
[2:42:57] <%Treuan> Dominancne
[2:42:59] <%dekkitout> That's more I posing
[2:43:00] <Solvari> at ease
[2:43:02] <+red_cuppa> body too thicc
[2:43:04] <MagmaRam> oh my god, Shepard, a bomb
[2:43:05] <%Birdigalore> It's military protocall
[2:43:05] <%sporeian94> 4 BOMBS IN A 30 FT SQ AREA
[2:43:05] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:43:05] <%walternatorz> the train only works if you a-pose
[2:43:10] <TomFrancis_> this part drags
[2:43:11] <+MugenSandan> To prevent the wind from knocking them over
[2:43:11] <Halospaz117> A BOMB
[2:43:14] <%sporeian94> GONNA BLOW UP A WHOLE COLONY
[2:43:19] <jillpilled> A BOMB?
[2:43:20] <murdocismyhero> Is the A pose the new T pose
[2:43:21] <+D00msDayDan> they used to stand with their weapons out, they a-pose now?
[2:43:24] <zanderwitch42> man this was hard my first time
[2:43:25] <trueGarnish> true
[2:43:27] <%troubled_ginger> It's harder to hack a door than disarming a bomb?!
[2:43:31] <%maenos2> i'm pretty sure you could use the other weapons still?
[2:43:31] <%ArcanumArcanum> WHAT? Why would use anything but the shotgun?
[2:43:35] <%Varlinator> 5 mins for 3 bombs kappa
[2:43:37] <%ArcanumArcanum> Shotgun all day every day
[2:43:40] <%ArcanumArcanum> then you run close
[2:43:41] <+NeonLight> Spectre shotgun is basically a sniper rifle anyway
[2:43:41] <%maenos2> i seem to recall using a rifle as a vanguard.
[2:43:42] <+JaseAdrift> what is that crouch walk LUL
[2:43:45] <Goraka91> Shotgun them more
[2:43:47] <mak0t0yukii> What is that crouch walk LUL
[2:43:47] <+vaderxyz1970> wait are all the games running on the ME3 engine?
[2:43:47] <+roronoapedro> that's what the space boost is for.
[2:43:49] <+flexin_apex> Yep
[2:43:51] <Halospaz117> Get closer
[2:43:55] <+thegreenbenis> Get close.
[2:43:55] <+athuramn> but now that all the weapons don't suck, they all become viable
[2:43:55] <%bread_assassin> Then you use barrier and run up.
[2:43:58] <Archmortal> you could USE the weapons, but you couldn't zoom and their accuracy was SIGNIFICANTLY worse
[2:44:00] <%Ynkubus_> @murdocismyhero yes, 3d modelling standard swith over and thus the meme swithed too
[2:44:02] <%Birdigalore> RUSH THE STAGE
[2:44:06] <Broken_Sonex> "Ehh, I'm Shepard, ehhh."
[2:44:07] <Grandnatics> Use your magic
[2:44:19] <%scaryboisupreme> Geth Snipers are a nightmare on Insanity, they're one hit kills
[2:44:21] <%sporeian94> missed a bomb
[2:44:23] <Goraka91> The pistol is really good with abilities, if memeory serves
[2:44:23] <%Birdigalore> Shot that robot in the dick...
[2:44:31] <+HelloImTom08> did he go vanguard? LUL
[2:44:36] <stormhawk9891> Honestly, my pistols ended up doing more damage than my shotguns by the end of it
[2:44:40] <trueGarnish> nah
[2:44:43] <zanderwitch42> why do you have to PUMP A FUTURE SHOTGUN
[2:44:48] <%walternatorz> is that how you get Paige to move?
[2:45:02] <%sporeian94> Hey Pat before you interact with beach go to the little area to the left of it for a cutscene
[2:45:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Vanguard and Infilitrator are Kino
[2:45:03] <Corgifist> I think people wanted Pat to go Vanguard just because of ME2 and ME3 charge
[2:45:04] <Blank9> it becomes the best in 3
[2:45:09] <lloyddboy> charge is the FUCKING BEST
[2:45:10] <Broken_Sonex> @zanderwitch42 Because then everything would be broken
[2:45:11] <thetunnelhomer> Charge*
[2:45:11] <%scaryboisupreme> @zanderwitch42 cause it's cool
[2:45:12] <+AmericanSkidd> @zanderwitch42 To feel cool
[2:45:13] <%NovaKnightmare> you saved the mass effect
[2:45:14] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Again, you can change classes between games
[2:45:14] <%Rumbutt> and in ME3 the dash becomes BUSTED
[2:45:16] <%maenos2> vanguard is AMAZING in 3
[2:45:16] <Archmortal> BIOTIC CHARGE
[2:45:16] <+vaderxyz1970> But at what cost
[2:45:16] <AlphaRayAllen> Earthborn War Hero chads ww@
[2:45:17] <Goraka91> @zanderwitch42 Is it really a shotgun if you don't?
[2:45:18] <+Buzzkill983> Vanguard is so fun in 2nd and 3rd
[2:45:19] <Grandnatics> ME1 you can get by the pistol
[2:45:21] <%sunsetdisc0> vanguard is the only way to play mass effect 2 and 3
[2:45:21] <+HelloImTom08> yea ME2 vanguard is the SHIT
[2:45:22] <+ghostfaceninja_> Elmo really getting in there
[2:45:23] <+athuramn> @corgifist yup
[2:45:24] <+black_pariah> always be charging
[2:45:24] <%Varlinator> Vanguard SLAPS in 2 & 3
[2:45:28] <Blank9> 3 is an entire different game with vanguard
[2:45:28] <%troubled_ginger> Bit ruined
[2:45:30] <thetunnelhomer> Charge turns the game into DMC.
[2:45:33] <Goraka91> How dare they not bring back the ME3 multiplayer
[2:45:35] <El_GhostV1> Biotic Charge :)
[2:45:36] <morningcharlie> also TJ LAZER
[2:45:36] <%ComradeConquistador> Just a small level as a treat.
[2:45:38] <stormhawk9891> BIOTIC CHARGE BABY
[2:45:42] <Goraka91> WAR CRIMES
[2:45:45] <%sunsetdisc0> im still chasing the rush vanguard gameplay gave me in me 2 and 3
[2:45:46] <%scaryboisupreme> CANCER GUN
[2:45:47] <Corgifist> Radioactive rounds are pretty good on Biotics
[2:45:47] <MagmaRam> isn't radioactive rounds a war crime
[2:45:49] <Apolonm> naaa, Soldier is better
[2:45:49] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[2:45:51] <Corgifist> They reduce cooldown IIRC
[2:45:52] <wasdsf> ON THE DICK?
[2:45:53] <+AmericanSkidd> Fuck yeah war crimes
[2:45:54] <%dekkitout> Are those legal in space?
[2:45:55] <Archmortal> Biotic charge paired with a REAL melee attack is fucking incredible
[2:45:55] <%walternatorz> uhhh
[2:45:56] <CorruptDropbear> CANCER GUN
[2:45:57] <%dave323dave> you should get that checked out
[2:45:57] <stantheman_97> that sounds like war crimes
[2:45:58] <Dfreddy8> You can switch classes between games anyway
[2:46:03] <%AzureGale> Oh no Pat has radioactive semen now
[2:46:03] <Sunstalker> sunsetdisc0 Play Vanquish
[2:46:04] <+craftyraichu> Oh boy, space war crimes!
[2:46:05] <BlueBiscuitGT> I can't believe they aren't a warcrime
[2:46:07] <+Buzzkill983> ME3 Multiplayer was waayy more fun than it should've been.
[2:46:07] <Lee_The_Limey> Warning: Prolonged use may cause infertility Kappa
[2:46:08] <jillpilled> Give those Geth cancer D:
[2:46:09] <morningcharlie> SPACE BOOST
[2:46:09] <%troubled_ginger> Radioactive Shepard jizz?
[2:46:14] <%NovaKnightmare> CANCER BULLETS
[2:46:15] <Goraka91> Secret police with polonium rounds, what a hero
[2:46:19] <Archmortal> it nerfs ENEMY cooldown reduction
[2:46:21] <murdocismyhero> SPACE RABIES!
[2:46:22] <Corgifist> I think the Poison or Fire rounds are the best honestly
[2:46:29] <gh1drah> robo cancer
[2:46:31] <MagmaRam> @Goraka91 Paragon moment
[2:46:32] <UncleMcgoo> Gee I wonder who Pat's gonna pick for Virmire
[2:46:36] <$Futurecity10> I didnt have a problem
[2:46:39] <+AmericanSkidd> THATS WHAT HAPPENED!?!
[2:46:39] <%RageCasanova> holy shit that's a bug?
[2:46:42] <+ThomasOfTroy> THAT FUCKING EXPLAINS WHY I CAN GET ANY OF THEM
[2:46:43] <%bread_assassin> Can confirm. THey are just gone for me.
[2:46:46] <+ThomasOfTroy> CAN'T*
[2:46:47] <Corgifist> The Spectre weapons are only really needed if you're playing Insanity
[2:46:48] <%RageCasanova> I thought that shit was intentional X'D
[2:46:49] <+D00msDayDan> nice shot pat
[2:46:51] <dd44dostivei> just rotate saves and its fixable
[2:46:53] <+JohnTimbre> They disappeared and reappeared for me.
[2:46:55] <%AzureGale> NEITHER
[2:46:57] <Archmortal> @PatStaresAt create a save BEFORE becoming a spectre and you can circumvent the bug
[2:46:57] <hippofant> Garrus
[2:46:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Neither
[2:46:58] <AlphaRayAllen> Oh man
[2:46:58] <%sporeian94> Pat interact with the railing to the left of the beacon for cutscene!
[2:46:59] <Sunstalker> Cheatengine them in later
[2:47:02] <%Nekros4442> I mean, Pat wants to kill Ashley himself
[2:47:04] <Goraka91> He's definitely saving Ashley to shoot her in 3
[2:47:04] <%Rumbutt> You're gonna save Ash so you can kill her in 3 right
[2:47:05] <%sunsetdisc0> @Sunstalker never heard of it but if it gives me that same rush i just might check it out
[2:47:05] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Yeah, and they only come back after Virmire
[2:47:06] <%scaryboisupreme> Kill Kaiden then shoot Ashley in ME3
[2:47:07] <%QueequegTheater> Ashley might be racist but at least she's not boring
[2:47:07] <%Mr_Pylon> It's one cool trick that Ashleys hate
[2:47:07] <Lee_The_Limey> probably not tho Kappa
[2:47:08] <BlueBiscuitGT> Keep her alive to make her suffer in the sequels yes
[2:47:10] <%maenos2> pat wants to savor the kill of ashely for 3
[2:47:10] <+Belasteris> Kaidan because Carth sucks
[2:47:12] <aiutare47> ME3 Multiplayer was great. It felt amazing to basically play as enemies and try their movesets. Plus the hazard firebases were super cool.
[2:47:12] <tomspartant99> tali
[2:47:13] <T_Sasquatch> Pat is saving Ashley
[2:47:14] <MagmaRam> Did they fix the bug where weapons could permanently overheat in this version?
[2:47:16] <%walternatorz> he's going to save Ashley for ME3
[2:47:18] <kyle_tander> Wait til High Explosive IX rounds, put those on your strongest shotgun and it’s really OP
[2:47:18] <Broken_Sonex> Ashley is a racist but Kaiden is boring being boring is worse.
[2:47:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT IS PLAYING THE LONG GAME
[2:47:21] <+SataruYamate> leaves kaiden so he can shoot ashley in 3
[2:47:22] <+athuramn> @mr_pylon fuck me LMQO
[2:47:25] <%RageCasanova> you choose Kaiden so you can shoot Ashley later lol
[2:47:25] <Chatterbox1991> I reiterate that Kaiden is worth having for ME3 because his moveset is better
[2:47:27] <%sporeian94> it's the railing right next to beacon on left for cutscene!
[2:47:29] <dredgyboi> Pats keeping ashley to kill her hiimself
[2:47:30] <%Varlinator> @PatStaresAt I could only but Spectre weapons literally only on the 1st time at Citadel & the last.
[2:47:31] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> There is extra bit next to the beacon
[2:47:34] <Goraka91> @aiutare47 Unga bunga krogan was great
[2:47:35] <+thegreenbenis> Leave Kaiden he's boring.
[2:47:36] <%AbnormalVoid> no, heat rise
[2:47:36] <+Buzzkill983> Main thing is leave person to die on bomb, they get cutscene for their sacrifice.
[2:47:45] <ghostofsolomon> so you're legit going full paragon?
[2:47:53] <%sporeian94> yeah literally no one notices this
[2:47:53] <%Noir_Valdr> wha
[2:47:54] <AlphaRayAllen> WOAH
[2:47:56] <Goraka91> Huh
[2:47:57] <aiutare47> @Goraka91 hammer one or vanguard one?
[2:47:58] <%Noir_Valdr> I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS

[2:48:02] <%RageCasanova> Me neither holy fuck
[2:48:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> @aiutare47 ME3's multiplayer was so much better than it had any right to be. God I loved it so much
[2:48:03] <%furiousfurioso> wtf
[2:48:03] <%maenos2> WHAT
[2:48:03] <%Wallabri> THERE'S A CUTSCENE HERE?!
[2:48:04] <%logoth_> Oh my god JC a BOMB
[2:48:04] <%sporeian94> I SWEAR I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER FOUND THIS
[2:48:04] <%scaryboisupreme> Make sure you send Ashley with the Salarians if you want them to come back in ME3
[2:48:05] <+JaseAdrift> is that new?
[2:48:06] <zanderwitch42> WHAT
[2:48:06] <%spoiledbadger> me neither
[2:48:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> I've played ME1 like 7 times, I've never seen that

[2:48:08] <ralphfromdk> same...
[2:48:08] <AlphaRayAllen> YO

[2:48:08] <AmuserName> I didn't see that for like 5 playthroughs.
[2:48:08] <thetunnelhomer> Yea, that's a rare one.
[2:48:09] <%strugglepunk2> Yo what
[2:48:09] <Corgifist> I've never ever seen this, I've played ME1 like 10 times
[2:48:09] <Goraka91> @aiutare47 Hammer of course
[2:48:10] <%Order_of_Mystery> Wow I have also never seen this

[2:48:15] <%Varlinator> OMG!
[2:48:15] <%spoiledbadger> lol
[2:48:15] <%condemned_15> LUL
[2:48:16] <+DoctorDerp388> atpCap
[2:48:16] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  one thing worth noting about Kaiden; in ME3 he actually apologizes for you-know-what while Ashley never does
[2:48:17] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Everyone miss it
[2:48:18] <trueGarnish> LUL
[2:48:18] <hippofant> D:
[2:48:19] <Archmortal> If you make a separate save right before becoming a spectre you can get the spectre weapons to appear like normal, but the top tier ones are not bugged
[2:48:19] <Corgifist> HEY I LIKE KAIDEN, he gets better in 3
[2:48:19] <+Buzzkill983> I MISSED THAT!?
[2:48:20] <+Peacefrog7> WTF IVE NEVER SEEN THAT
[2:48:20] <thetunnelhomer> Hey, no bully Kaiden.
[2:48:21] <AlphaRayAllen> THAT'S CRAZY
[2:48:22] <Detrius25> Yep lol
[2:48:22] <%pokefan9956> look at elmo
[2:48:22] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> hidden interactble brah
[2:48:22] <%strugglepunk2> That makes this attack seem WAY worse
[2:48:23] <stantheman_97> kaiden is okay
[2:48:23] <HollowMan190> you call that a landing
[2:48:24] <%furiousfurioso> i've never heard of that ever
[2:48:26] <+black_pariah> i actually liked ashley
[2:48:27] <Grandnatics> "Oh my god" "This is where they landed" "YOU'RE FUCKING LOSERS"
[2:48:28] <Broken_Sonex> I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT SHOT
[2:48:28] <+clientdevil> Pot Rick
[2:48:29] <%RageCasanova> Kaiden have migraine leave em alone lol
[2:48:29] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[2:48:30] <+athuramn> just look at the way she's standing
[2:48:35] <geosspone> whoa I never saw that either
[2:48:37] <MagmaRam> Garrus and Wrex chad squad when
[2:48:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> Are they the worst human squadmates in the series, @PatStaresAt ?
[2:48:41] <Vynith> god they suck so much
[2:48:42] <+AmericanSkidd> Time to become the PROTAGONIST
[2:48:45] <+SataruYamate> at least ashley is a good class, whereas kaiden is a sentinel in ME 1
[2:48:45] <HollowMan190> just walk right up to it
[2:48:49] <%Rumbutt> This is an all Wrex playthrough as soon as you get him, right?
[2:48:52] <aiutare47> barrier into charge into nova on the vanguard krogan was fun, but not nearly as fun as playing as the turian Cabal
[2:48:52] <AlphaRayAllen> YOU IDIOT
[2:48:54] <Goraka91> @black_pariah They're not a great person, but they get better and people demanding their death rubs me the wrong way
[2:48:55] <%NovaKnightmare> Kaiden is the Narc vs Ashley's spacist
[2:48:55] <%NocturneNovember> And here, Ashley almost becomes the hero
[2:48:57] <%RageCasanova> holy fuck X'D
[2:48:57] <%scaryboisupreme> YOU CAN'T BE THE MAIN CHARACTER I'M THE MAIN CHARACTER
[2:48:58] <%bugz_munny> the MIND RAPE
[2:48:59] <UncleMcgoo> Need some Uncle Urdnot in this crew
[2:49:00] <%maenos2> just think, ashley could've been the main character

[2:49:06] <%condemned_15> meeeeee
[2:49:06] <%Varlinator> Ashley, you idiot!
[2:49:07] <%RageCasanova> I forgot this shit is gender specific
[2:49:07] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> suplex her
[2:49:07] <MagmaRam> NO RACISM ALLOWED
[2:49:08] <iosephe> aw, no suplex
[2:49:08] <+Buzzkill983> It's always opposite gender who walks towards it
[2:49:08] <Halospaz117> YES SUPLEX HER
[2:49:09] <ianabstract> suplex her out of the protagonist chair
[2:49:09] <+necrocannibal2> he gave her a reacharound

[2:49:13] <AlphaRayAllen> THANK GOD THAT RACIST ISN'T THE MAIN CHRACATER
[2:49:13] <%sporeian94> THAT VISION IS THE COOLEST
[2:49:14] <+zajoestar> Ashley almost becomes the main character
[2:49:17] <srv4254> andromeda almost happened
[2:49:17] <linSP> that was close...
[2:49:17] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I liked that Kaiden and Ashley are kinda normal people compared to all the edgelords you get
[2:49:18] <reonome> LUL
[2:49:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ASHLEY WAS ALMOST THE CHOSEN ONE
[2:49:19] <%NovaKnightmare> EVENT HORIZON REFERENCE
[2:49:20] <vilecrois> It'd be a way different game if the racist was the MC
[2:49:21] <%Varlinator> ohnPanic
[2:49:22] <%scaryboisupreme> What if Shep's head just exploded
[2:49:23] <thetunnelhomer> By the way Javik is like underneath them.

[2:56:33] <Broken_Sonex> "Saren being mind controlled is super lame, bro." BANG
[2:56:35] <+Peacefrog7> by the way the "i need to despawn" killed me @PatStaresAt
[2:56:38] <aiutare47> @Lee_The_Limey plausible deniability
[2:56:39] <Ids560> it is the best mass effect
[2:56:40] <%Birdigalore> Let's all bully Ashley into suicide
[2:56:43] <%sunsetdisc0> what about me 2 and 3
[2:56:43] <%sporeian94> This game unironically prevented me from killing myself as stupid as that sounds
[2:56:44] <tranquilturnip> its also fun to make fun of
[2:56:45] <Jane_Lo> this OST, ahhh
[2:56:45] <SaltyAzteca> Space ambience
[2:56:45] <ghostofsolomon> its like star trek but better
[2:56:46] <Melchior_the_Wise> Pat being Jacked
[2:56:46] <Goraka91> SourPls
[2:56:46] <+Promessa_EX> pats just applying critical theory to mass effect is all
[2:56:49] <%condemned_15> Normandy ASMR
[2:56:49] <BlueBiscuitGT> Nostalgia triggered by ambiance
[2:56:50] <%Varlinator> ohn10 ohn10 ohn10 ohn10
[2:56:54] <LunarRemix> Mass Effect rules man, it's super fun
[2:56:54] <Solvari> on point
[2:56:55] <%bugz_munny> "stop it, get some help"
[2:56:56] <%scaryboisupreme> Please for the love of GOD, don't let ME4 suck ass
[2:56:57] <samazam94> its the best star trek game
[2:56:57] <+Peacefrog7> IMMACULATE
[2:56:58] <jillpilled> Absolute BOP
[2:56:58] <moonmeh> mass effect ost is so fucking good
[2:56:59] <seniormeatbox> So pat do you hate 2 and 3 or just 3
[2:57:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> THE THEME OF TALKING TO YOUR CREW YEA YEA
[2:57:02] <murdocismyhero> Can you get pet fish in this one
[2:57:04] <%GarbageNirvana> the more you love something the more you tend to nitpick it in my experience
[2:57:04] <%sunsetdisc0> @sporeian94 honestly, same
[2:57:06] <%troubled_ginger> This game's music set a trend
[2:57:07] <geosspone> Mass Effect 1 is the best
[2:57:07] <aiutare47> the main theme still gives me shivers
[2:57:09] <+AmericanSkidd> Loving a game means making fun of its stupid bullshit and still having fun
[2:57:09] <buhbuhboat> Its super jank, but still great regardless
[2:57:10] <MagmaRam> @scaryboisupreme isn't andromeda ME4
[2:57:10] <%Varlinator> "Perfection."
[2:57:15] <Goraka91> Valid
[2:57:15] <AlphaRayAllen> LUL
[2:57:16] <BlueBiscuitGT> Also the ending theme is great
[2:57:16] <wasdsf> citadel ROCKS
[2:57:17] <moonmeh> it owns
[2:57:17] <%SABiscotti> It is VERY good
[2:57:20] <rudybrossard> You never played it ?
[2:57:20] <%scaryboisupreme> okay ME5
[2:57:21] <%sporeian94> Citadel DLC IS ANIME FANSERVICE THE GAME
[2:57:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @scaryboisupreme as much as I hope so as well, don't hold your breath
[2:57:22] <%spoiledbadger> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:57:26] <reonome> LUL
[2:57:27] <+ScottishMadJacko> your perspective on 3 will be interesting
[2:57:29] <%Ranryu692> the Leviathan dlc is pretty good too
[2:57:29] <Wolfstriker121> mass effect 2 ost will put you into heaven with the sound track
[2:57:29] <+TheotherKristian> It does own
[2:57:30] <%troubled_ginger> It's the best part of the entire series
[2:57:30] <moonmeh> did u never play it?
[2:57:31] <%Noir_Valdr> well ME3 is actually a good game outside of the Citadel DLC, and that DLC is actually fantastic. So there you go.
[2:57:31] <%sporeian94> YOU FUCKING MEET BLASTO
[2:57:31] <%Treuan> God that alone makes me interested in trying out 3
[2:57:32] <MagmaRam> citadel is 100% fanservice and it owns
[2:57:32] <Ids560> the citadel dlc is just fanfiction character interactions and it's great
[2:57:36] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If they just put it after a Destroy ending it literally fixes the ending
[2:57:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CITADEL DLC IS THE BEST
[2:57:36] <AlphaRayAllen> TALK TO SETH GREEN
[2:57:38] <dd44dostivei> it's straight up an episode of futurama
[2:57:38] <Corgifist> All of the ME3 DLCs are really fun
[2:57:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> Citadel almost makes up for the ending. Almost.
[2:57:39] <BrOOnoh> just finished that dlc actually
[2:57:40] <AngryAsian5> It's the best fanservice DLC LUL
[2:57:42] <+Peacefrog7> main menu theme in me 1 gives me goosebumps every time
[2:57:44] <rudybrossard> This and the Levianthan DLC make the ending make sens
[2:57:46] <moonmeh> u really did a good job on it
[2:57:47] <%Varlinator> It's one of the greatest DLC's for any game ever made
[2:57:47] <UncleMcgoo> Citadel is incredible
[2:57:48] <+AmericanSkidd> Citadel is the best
[2:57:48] <%SirGO0SE> ah I see. so theres a reason I should buy this maybe
[2:57:49] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt ME3 is really not nearly as bad as people say it is. The ending feels garbage but only in its emptiness. The game itself is largely fine
[2:57:51] <tanarath> @patstaresat you can complete Samara's romance in Citadel
[2:57:51] <+CookieCutter007> Citadel DLC is a sitcom LUL
[2:57:52] <%Monkeyweed21> TALI GETS WASTED AND TALKS ABOUT HER SWEAT
[2:57:55] <+robosqueeb> ME1 had that really intense film grain on it too
[2:57:56] <moonmeh> mass effect 1 characters were monsters
[2:57:57] <%afronooch> mine looked like Lebron :(
[2:57:57] <+JaseAdrift> my character looked terrible in Me1
[2:57:57] <%scaryboisupreme> the mod that turns ME3 Citadel into the actual ending is amazing
[2:57:57] <TourettesPlays> Citadel DLC is literally reddit and the absolute worst part of mass effect
[2:57:59] <%Breedofevil> he looks like a tired add
[2:57:59] <+JohnTimbre> Shepard is 29 here.
[2:58:00] <%Breedofevil> dad
[2:58:00] <Wolfstriker121> they look like shit
[2:58:04] <%Monkeyweed21> inbred space potatos
[2:58:05] <ghostofsolomon> pat who are you gonna romance?
[2:58:07] <Wolfstriker121> but that was back in the day
[2:58:07] <+flexin_apex> Harkin twin
[2:58:08] <+Peacefrog7> its crazy what a lighting change can do
[2:58:09] <+NeonLight> WORDS
[2:58:09] <+red_cuppa> you did a good job!
[2:58:09] <Melchior_the_Wise> CODEX IS best
[2:58:11] <%Ranryu692> I always went with default Shep first
[2:58:14] <+london_flexing> The content in citadel is A+, the writing in citadel is like a B- tho
[2:58:14] <jillpilled> No more film grain garbage either, it's pretty good looking compared
[2:58:16] <+Peacefrog7> YEP CODEX
[2:58:16] <+JaseAdrift> L O R E
[2:58:17] <+ALazo> you guys wanna learn about learning
[2:58:17] <%Varlinator> Default Femshep was violated until 3
[2:58:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> @tanarath what!? for real?
[2:58:18] <%valriot> Through all the discourse over the ending of ME3, the game itself is fantastic, and they really hammer home that MEs characters are rad as fuck
[2:58:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I WANNA HEAR HIM
[2:58:19] <Wolfstriker121> PAT who you romancing!!!!
[2:58:22] <Goraka91> @aiutare47 The Krogan part in particular is pretty fantastic
[2:58:22] <wasdsf> LUL LUL
[2:58:23] <AlphaRayAllen> CRATER
[2:58:23] <+red_cuppa> doodLUL
[2:58:24] <%blutzwavedave> LUL LUL
[2:58:25] <SaltyAzteca> That genuine disgust LUL
[2:58:27] <%TheMattman1313> FUCK OFF SPACE RACIST
[2:58:30] <Broken_Sonex> Fan Fact Shepard is 29 in ME1 and 32 in 3
[2:58:31] <%barrakuta371> ME1 Codex was the best
[2:58:31] <+HelloImTom08> the codex is so awesome, love that nerd shit
[2:58:33] <%sporeian94> OK SO THIS ALWAYS BUGGED ME, BUT WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BATHROOM ON THE SR1
[2:58:33] <ghostofsolomon> PAT WHO ARE YOU ROMANCING?!!?\

[2:58:41] <+ScottishMadJacko> wrong ship BibleThump
[2:58:41] <AlphaRayAllen> MOMMY
[2:58:41] <karovus> mass effect is the only game i can think of with a character creator that i always run with the default character
[2:58:45] <%sunsetdisc0> @PatStaresAt speaking of dlc as far as you know are those gonna work okay? thats been a concern of mine since bioware social went down
[2:58:45] <%sporeian94> LIKE DO THEY POOP IN THE SLEEPING PODS!?
[2:58:52] <aiutare47> @Goraka91 I love the fight even if its big stupid action, its fun.
[2:58:53] <BrianDLahey> @condemned_15 hahahahaha
[2:58:54] <%scaryboisupreme> Calibrate these fat turian nuts

[2:59:21] <%TallYoda08> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink
[2:59:21] <%Order_of_Mystery> @tanarath I never knew that. ;-;
[2:59:25] <Goraka91> Old enough
[2:59:26] <+AmericanSkidd> You cannot find a toilet on the Normandy SR-1
[2:59:27] <thelonechris> So is Earth just a scorched rock at this point in the future?
[2:59:28] <AlphaRayAllen> Older than you
[2:59:30] <%Bt_Robot> How did Udina become an ambassador, he feels like the worst person for that job ever.
[2:59:31] <Broken_Sonex> She likes them Solider boys
[2:59:32] <+Buzzkill983> I figured 40's
[2:59:33] <%scaryboisupreme> @Futurecity10 a very......respectable position
[2:59:36] <ape_hawk> being a space doctor ages you up quick
[2:59:38] <+D00msDayDan> old enough
[2:59:38] <+JaseAdrift> she sounds like he's in her 40s
[2:59:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> Chakwas is the coolest space grandma
[2:59:38] <%Torus1025> Like 45ish
[2:59:39] <%Monkeyweed21> shes like 40 to 50
[2:59:39] <Josef_Stryker> I'd say say between her 30s and 40s
[2:59:41] <+StoopKid241> Yeah she definitely looked older in the original
[2:59:41] <seniormeatbox> She's voiced by the doctor from TNG isn't she?
[2:59:42] <MagmaRam> I figured late 50s, early 60s.
[2:59:43] <Dead_Trickster> Love that she just admits that after med school she was horny and likes a man in uniform.
[2:59:43] <+Peacefrog7> yeah her hair was like white in original
[2:59:43] <%GarbageNirvana> isn't human life kind of extended in this future as well
[2:59:44] <%troubled_ginger> Eh, I always felt 40+
[2:59:44] <%toastybites> at least 10 years older than you
[2:59:45] <Broken_Sonex> Like 49 I'd imagine
[2:59:46] <CorruptDropbear> 40ish
[2:59:46] <%Birdigalore> Never too old Kappa
[2:59:48] <%Torus1025> Her hair's still pretty dark
[2:59:49] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, she was snow white in original 2
[2:59:50] <%QueequegTheater> @thelonechris what? Not at all
[2:59:51] <aiutare47> @thelonechris its not all that bad, a lot of megacities but it looks fine
[2:59:52] <+ScottishMadJacko> 40s I reckon
[2:59:52] <Goraka91> @thelonechris Nah, bit of a population thing but nothing terrible
[2:59:53] <Wolfstriker121> shes ric flairs age.......1000000+ yrs old
[2:59:54] <+athuramn> you're saying she sounds 4 years younger than you?
[2:59:54] <%Varlinator> I always thought she had just turned 50
[2:59:55] <%scaryboisupreme> She's voiced by the Locus Queen from Gears
[2:59:56] <TourettesPlays> I would totally turn my head and cough for her
[2:59:58] <%QueequegTheater> Old enough to be a GILF
[2:59:59] <%Andrizzleton> Life expectancy in ME is 125 for humans
[3:00:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> she talks like a woman in her 60s what?
[3:00:07] <samazam94> shes a gilf to me and theres nothing anyone can say tbat could my mind
[3:00:21] <+Promessa_EX> the voice is 60's
[3:00:25] <+athuramn> @andrizzleton genuinely didn't know that
[3:00:34] <%logoth_> Being VERY BLAND
[3:00:36] <%Teintstein> Teintstein subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! has pat fucked an alien yet?
[3:00:37] <Goraka91> Spartan Is pog
[3:00:37] <%scaryboisupreme> Chakwas and Admiral Raan have my favorite voices
[3:00:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ouch
[3:00:41] <Wolfstriker121> adapt was bad in me 1 but kick ass in me 2 and me3 ..that true or a hard disagree ?
[3:00:41] <MagmaRam> Kaiden's lucky. He just lost his personality.
[3:00:45] <%Treuan> You know as I'm older I can relate more to Kaiden having horrible headaches
[3:00:47] <someyounguy1> kaidans biggest complication is being supremely boring
[3:00:48] <seniormeatbox> Just talk to Kaiden
[3:00:50] <+D00msDayDan> for a second i thought she was talking about controller prompts like it's a kojima game
[3:00:51] <trueGarnish> freaking NES jammed up there
[3:00:52] <aiutare47> because we shouldnt use them
[3:00:53] <Blank9> cyber newtypes but actually successful

[3:02:56] <+Buzzkill983> Pressly is a Spacist to Tali. And then the hips convinced him otherwise
[3:02:57] <Halospaz117> SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASH INSTEAD
[3:02:58] <%Rumbutt> The only reason Wrex doesn't kill her is cause it's not worth the ammo oroLUL
[3:02:59] <%QueequegTheater> Pressly is trying to hide his erection the dead Turian
[3:03:01] <%Solid_Stro> Which is why ME2 is the best
[3:03:04] <tanarath> if only ashley had saved jenkins.
[3:03:05] <MagmaRam> he's the Joker baby
[3:03:07] <wasdsf> SR2 is way cooler tho

[3:03:58] <%troubled_ginger> Tax evasion must be REALLY easy is space
[3:03:59] <+Buzzkill983> That would've been so fun
[3:03:59] <%condemned_15> oh taxes. I thought you said Texas

[3:04:07] <CrypticMochi> I wish the SR2 kept the blue lighting though
[3:04:07] <%Emperor_Machinus> What you think space built it's self and is endless? OF COURSE there is space taxes!
[3:04:07] <%MisterRockett> There's still time

[3:04:22] <%saiyanblitz> Hey everybody
[3:04:23] <trueGarnish> haHAA good one ash
[3:04:24] <%afronooch> a c-sec game would be the best
[3:04:24] <El_GhostV1> Judgement mass effect
[3:04:26] <MagmaRam> A well-made detective game is a fine, fine thing.
[3:04:28] <Astrophizz> get za/um to make it
[3:04:28] <Sigma_190_Beta> His lips looked weird] in that cutscene.
[3:04:30] <tomspartant99> as a c-sec officer la noir like
[3:04:32] <%sunsetdisc0> @Wolfstriker121 are they making an me4? wasnt that basically what andromeda was?
[3:04:33] <Detrius25> SingsNote SingsNote 👽
[3:04:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I FUCKIN LOVE THIS GAME HOLY SHIT
[3:04:46] <wasdsf> 100%
[3:04:49] <%SwdVengeance> Law & Order: Citadel
[3:04:49] <moonmeh> no doubt
[3:04:50] <ape_hawk> yeah, they do
[3:04:50] <tranquilturnip> well, yeah
[3:04:51] <%scaryboisupreme> oh no not at all
[3:04:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BOY DO THEY
[3:04:53] <%Varlinator> 422? Damn... just a little too much
[3:04:54] <Vyskus> yeah I could agree with that
[3:04:54] <%dekkitout> I mean- duh...
[3:04:54] <Basch71> for sure
[3:04:54] <stormhawk9891> Definitely
[3:04:55] <Vynith> yup
[3:04:55] <%Nekros4442> I mean they actually finished ME2 compared to KOTOR 2
[3:04:55] <%valriot> That goes without saying
[3:04:55] <+ScottishMadJacko> oh for sure
[3:04:56] <aiutare47> yeah
[3:04:56] <%maenos2> yeah i can agree with that
[3:04:56] <jillpilled> For sure
[3:04:56] <Ids560> mass effect 2's story is pretty bad
[3:04:57] <%spoiledbadger> agreed
[3:04:57] <tanarath> they do
[3:04:57] <Blank9> 3 does too
[3:04:57] <heyterezi> absolutely
[3:04:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Wolfstriker121 They are making an ME 4
[3:04:58] <%condemned_15> Mass Effect 2 is actually finished
[3:04:58] <%scaryboisupreme> Kotor 2 holds up the best
[3:04:59] <Realimpact> WOW THAT WAS FAST
[3:05:00] <%MisterRockett> Was that ever a question?????
[3:05:00] <PanicSwytch> What about Jade Empire?
[3:05:00] <seniormeatbox> hell yeah
[3:05:01] <Halospaz117> I like that they added that forcefield in the airlock from ME3
[3:05:02] <Goraka91> Kotor is juuuuust old enough to be jank
[3:05:02] <+JaseAdrift> FUCK UDINA
[3:05:03] <Dfreddy8> A Tell Tale Mass Effect game
[3:05:03] <TomFrancis_> well now that theyve been remade
[3:05:03] <+chiazam> THATS NOT FAIR
[3:05:04] <%Varlinator> absolutely
[3:05:04] <+ScottishMadJacko> ugh
[3:05:06] <%valriot> KOTOR needs mods to WORK LUL
[3:05:06] <+Belasteris> Yeah, finished games will do that.
[3:05:06] <Halospaz117> FUCKING UDINA
[3:05:06] <%maenos2> FUCK YOU UDINA
[3:05:08] <+ScottishMadJacko> udina
[3:05:09] <spuginky> waaay less jank
[3:05:09] <+MightyDuckShoes> I mean they're complete games
[3:05:10] <+AmericanSkidd> "oh, it's you..."
[3:05:10] <Blank9> 3 holds up much better than vanilla kotor2
[3:05:10] <mr_saturday93> racist aliens
[3:05:12] <+alphonseisbest> No SHIT, their not as OLD!
[3:05:12] <%QueequegTheater> AH YES, REAPERS
[3:05:14] <%CatastropheCorvid> KOTOR 1 and 2 haven't had a remaster though
[3:05:14] <+chiazam> KOTOR 2 DOESNT COUNT
[3:05:14] <%MidnightBurst12> i mean, they came out later so it makes sense.
[3:05:15] <Ids560> kotor 2 being unfinished is pretty bad
[3:05:15] <%Solid_Stro> Absolutely
[3:05:17] <Wolfstriker121> FUCK YOU UDUNA!
[3:05:20] <BlueBiscuitGT> True for Kotor 2, but I think Kotor 1 holds up almost as well
[3:05:20] <tanarath> God, just kill him
[3:05:20] <PanicSwytch> JADE EMPIRE???
[3:05:21] <+SilverDevilfish> oh look 4 unlikable characters all in one room
[3:05:22] <%Order_of_Mystery> god this universe is so cool. I want 4 to be good and the series to come back
[3:05:24] <mr_saturday93> but fuck udina
[3:05:24] <%scaryboisupreme> why does he sound like that
[3:05:25] <CorruptDropbear> Udina is fine.
[3:05:26] <+athuramn> hmmm, 2 maybe, 1 less so. you haven't hit all of me1s "fun" moments
[3:05:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FUCK YOU UDINA EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE RIGHT IN THIS MOMENT
[3:05:29] <+flexin_apex> Oh god udina
[3:05:31] <+JaseAdrift> Probably a Bigger asshole than Ashley
[3:05:31] <%blutzwavedave> ASSHOLES
[3:05:32] <MagmaRam> @Astrophizz I would give literally anything for a more straight-laced detective game with Visual Calculus in it
[3:05:32] <%SABiscotti> Udina took a DNA test and is 100% that FUCKER
[3:05:33] <%dekkitout> Is it wrong to expect accountability?
[3:05:33] <+TheotherKristian> Well yeah, this remaster holds up better than the walking technical corpse that is KOTOR
[3:05:37] <%barkon345> Shepard looks like Ron Howard's Brother Clint
[3:05:38] <seniormeatbox> SPACIST 2
[3:05:39] <willyfreshness> Udina sucks, kill him
[3:05:39] <Josef_Stryker> FUCK THE COUNCIL AND FUCK UDINA

[3:05:49] <%Bt_Robot> Udina, worst ambassador ever
[3:05:49] <+NeonLight> Udina literally looks like a corpse
[3:05:50] <%Solid_Stro> Dirty humans taking our jobs psaWhat
[3:05:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Udina is a typical politician. Which is why he sucks.
[3:05:52] <Dfreddy8> "Reapers"
[3:05:53] <SaltyAzteca> Who is Udina's VA again? Sounds familiar
[3:05:55] <jillpilled> He's right but hating him actually is way more tempting in this moment
[3:05:59] <+Buzzkill983> The boy is dangerous
[3:06:03] <Wolfstriker121> they just blind
[3:06:04] <%Breedofevil> AND HE SMELLS

[3:06:13] <MagmaRam> Udina's face looks, uh
[3:06:13] <Broken_Sonex> Why are Udina's lips so silver?
[3:06:15] <%QueequegTheater> @SaltyAzteca Bill Ratner
[3:06:22] <lloyddboy> ahsy motherfucker
[3:06:23] <Jane_Lo> i think udina makes sense, but then in me3 he's written so fucking bad
[3:06:24] <+YabbaTroll> man fuck Udina
[3:06:29] <+athuramn> it's amazing that someone as unlikable as Udina managed to even get where he is
[3:06:29] <yojohny> Udina looks half dead
[3:06:30] <%LouieRouie> lighting
[3:06:35] <MagmaRam> was Udina doing a shitload of weird colored space coke five seconds ago or something
[3:06:35] <PanicSwytch> Udina lips looks odd
[3:06:36] <%CalderGaming> "witness me, commander!"
[3:06:38] <moonmeh> yeah he was written really badly in me3

[3:06:40] <Lee_The_Limey> I wish you could slap this chode
[3:06:42] <moonmeh> that makes very little sense
[3:06:42] <%ComradeConquistador> @broken_sonex Witness him.
[3:06:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Udina's a dick but right now he's right
[3:06:46] <Goraka91> @Jane_Lo Yeah that kind of felt like fanservice
[3:06:46] <%scaryboisupreme> Oh boy I sure hope Garrus doesn't get stonewalled in his investigation
[3:06:46] <ghostofsolomon> why does he sound annoying
[3:06:46] <%walternatorz> Is there a space drug that Udina is on that makes his lips silver?

[3:07:48] <MagmaRam> @seniormeatbox FRANTIC AGREEMENT: YES
[3:07:48] <+MightyDuckShoes> it seems like Bioware relied on the lower texture resolution to even out the textures. These look way too mottled and saturated. reminds me of early HD Poooorrr-folios....

[3:10:52] <%Teintstein> humans cannot understand fart language
[3:10:55] <+SilverDevilfish> So they can talk behind your back to each other by farting pheromones
[3:11:04] <dashmatt> so articulate
[3:11:05] <+silkeater> silkeater subscribed with Prime. 
[3:11:07] <%Garthunox> Pat have you ever seen what an Elcor geared up for combat looks like?

[3:11:33] <+ScottishMadJacko> calyn is sweet boy
[3:11:34] <%ComradeConquistador> They're actually interesting and not "space elves lol."
[3:11:34] <Lee_The_Limey> Volus only care about $$$$ LUL
[3:11:35] <%s1rcuit> @Garthunox tell me they have huge cannons on their backs
[3:11:36] <+Peacefrog7> play the codex after this convo @PatStaresAt
[3:11:37] <AngryAsian5> GENUINE ENTHUSIASM
[3:11:39] <quigley_plays> Also there is an troupe of elcor actors who consantly sell out theaters on the citadel.
[3:11:43] <%Order_of_Mystery> everyone remember the Volus character in 3's multiplayer? BIOTIC WIND!
[3:11:43] <arvym2> Elcor are good frens
[3:11:45] <+Peacefrog7> for the elcor i mean
[3:11:46] <Broken_Sonex> The Volus are just are bunch of space Pats
[3:11:53] <aiutare47> Volus and Quarrian are the MOST HEAVYHANDED metaphors in all of ME, and ME has Turians.
[3:11:56] <+AmericanSkidd> He is so polite its such a breath of fresh air
[3:11:57] <%Bt_Robot> Volus are the most hilarious.  They are all Pat for no reason.
[3:11:59] <lloyddboy> are there any canon asari that fucked an elcor
[3:12:03] <nobody287> I love these dudes
[3:12:04] <%Solid_Stro> Volus are an offshoot of Pat’s family tree
[3:12:06] <ralphfromdk> With how heavy their gravity is, how big did their spaceships have to be?
[3:12:07] <samazam94> i have gears in my eyes right now
[3:12:07] <+senfood> Fond nostalgia: The asari milked us dry.
[3:12:13] <%dekkitout> A whole ass lifetime, impressive
[3:12:14] <seniormeatbox> HAMLET WITH A PURE ELCOR CAST
[3:12:22] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the Elcor are one of my favorite species in the Mass Effect IP
[3:12:23] <+YabbaTroll> @senfood LUL
[3:12:31] <Broken_Sonex> @senfood You get a gold star for that one
[3:12:32] <Apolonm> Where is the true heroe Blasto
[3:12:32] <Lee_The_Limey> LUL
[3:12:34] <%SABiscotti> SPACE ENTS
[3:12:38] <+ghostfaceninja_> so they're conservatives LUL
[3:12:40] <%bugz_munny> aint nothing sudden with this guy
[3:12:44] <yojohny> Volus are definitely sparc Pats
[3:12:50] <%Bt_Robot> Volus live on a planet of pure fart juice, and it makes them angry
[3:12:53] <+HefestoForges> rude shepard
[3:12:58] <%mike2hands> SPACENTS
[3:13:01] <+TheEvilOmega> I think Elcor get cannons strapped to their backs in Mass Effect 3.
[3:13:10] <%dekkitout> Not false psaCrazyhand
[3:13:13] <%Solid_Stro> Elcor are like cats, they hate change
[3:13:13] <%Varlinator> Chastising rebuke
[3:13:18] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the first time I saw a Volus it made me immediately go "hey a space badger"
[3:13:22] <+ScottishMadJacko> elcors are tanks in me3
[3:13:23] <+TheEvilOmega> Elcor cannons are the best.
[3:13:26] <%AncelDeLambert> they're pretty right to be mad
[3:13:27] <%spoiledbadger> Huh
[3:13:27] <+AmericanSkidd> It is messed up they have to share an office
[3:13:27] <Broken_Sonex> Quiet Space Pat
[3:13:30] <scrublord009> Why can't I fuck a female turian?
[3:13:34] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, humans are awesome, but they're not wrong
[3:13:36] <mr_saturday93> BULLSHIT
[3:13:38] <%sporeian94> DUDE IMAGINE INVENTING THE FUCKING GALATIC ECONOMY AND GETTING SIDELINED
[3:13:39] <%dekkitout> I mean...
[3:13:43] <+red_cuppa> total bullshit
[3:13:45] <Goraka91> Volus: Bro we've been waiting for literally 2000 years
[3:13:45] <+SilverDevilfish> We kill good because we're violent monkeys
[3:13:45] <Mattais88> Just got here, Pat Shep looks like he's 45
[3:13:46] <wasdsf> everyones just afraid humans will kick their ass
[3:13:47] <aiutare47> keep your enemies close and happy
[3:13:48] <+TheotherKristian> The human way, the GUN way
[3:13:48] <AlphaRayAllen> Bruh
[3:13:49] <SaltyAzteca> WE HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS
[3:13:50] <%NovaKnightmare> YEA BUT IM HUMAN SO FUCK YOU DIN
[3:13:51] <+DoctorDerp388> humans are SPECIAL
[3:13:51] <%QueequegTheater> That's totally how it works in the real world, look at China in the UN
[3:13:54] <karovus> i love that the side races are like "fuck this we're just side races to the council"
[3:13:54] <ralphfromdk> We kicked the turians asses in war, and we got a bigger room because they are scared the agressive monkeys might act up LUL
[3:13:56] <%Solid_Stro> I love this Elcor already
[3:13:57] <+ScottishMadJacko> yup
[3:13:57] <%Dapper_Cactuar> so much of the galactic economy would be a mess without the Volus
[3:13:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @scrublord009 gotta wade through andromeda for that. kinda worth it
[3:13:59] <+Bones8677> He's SUPER RIGHT to be pissed
[3:14:00] <%SABiscotti> BEUROCRACY!
[3:14:00] <+marino1x88> military winning again
[3:14:00] <AmuserName> @PatStaresAt Remember how Bioware marketed the dialog skipping as "dynamic interruptions during conversation"?
[3:14:02] <+HefestoForges> new guy gets promoted 1 month into the job
[3:14:04] <akitanito> but huuumans special
[3:14:04] <BlindGato> Didn't we trash the Turians when we showed up tho?
[3:14:09] <seniormeatbox> PAT SIZE ALIEN
[3:14:12] <%MelBrooksKA> Do they get along?
[3:14:12] <Blank9> humans basically won a war though
[3:14:12] <Lee_The_Limey> We should share our office with the Elcor, you
[3:14:13] <AlphaRayAllen> HUMANS ARE JUST BETTER
[3:14:13] <%Teintstein> "never should have come here Earth Clan"
[3:14:15] <%Treuan> I to this day remember "Chastising Rebuke Din"
[3:14:16] <%dekkitout> That sounds like space politics working as intended
[3:14:17] <%walternatorz> they established their place within the citadel in a "lifetime", earth did it in 10 years
[3:14:18] <RaidenRising> pat racws
[3:14:21] <lloyddboy> "WHY IS SAUDI ARABIA ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL???"
[3:14:22] <%scaryboisupreme> i think someone describes humans as the councils favorite pets
[3:14:23] <Broken_Sonex> THE PALUS
[3:14:25] <+Peacefrog7> it is bs if you think about it its crazy disrespectful how fast humans move through council politics
[3:14:25] <samazam94> its super horseshit
[3:14:26] <Blank9> elcor didn't show off they could kick intergalactic ass immediately
[3:14:27] <MagmaRam> Didn't humans get fucked over in the Space London Naval Treaty, so they just decided to build carriers as a loophole?
[3:14:27] <%Varlinator> chastising rebuke
[3:14:28] <+TheEvilOmega> So, Volus  not being a council race is because they can't contribute to the military force.
[3:14:28] <%QueequegTheater> BUILT DIFFERENT
[3:14:29] <scrublord009> @cobalt_phoenix_ Nice
[3:14:29] <CorruptDropbear> "Yes, but the humans can probably work out how to kill us properly if they wanted to.*
[3:14:30] <%mike2hands> yes dan INTRODUCE YOURSELF
[3:14:32] <MagmaRam> That's why humans get their own office.
[3:14:32] <+flexin_apex> Love this guy LUL
[3:14:35] <aiutare47> @BlindGato we gave them a serious fight, which is a lot for turians
[3:14:35] <%maenos2> @blindgato we held our own pretty well but the turians didn't bring their main army to bear.  they tought we were smaller than we were.
[3:14:44] <Sunstalker> Imagine if there was an Elcor version of a valley girl LUL
[3:14:44] <+ThomasOfTroy> The Volus legit deserve a council seat for LITERALLY creating the galactic economy
[3:14:44] <+Buzzkill983> Humans singlehandedly kept up with the entire Galaxy's army. They went OH!?
[3:14:45] <%Bt_Robot> But humans won a war against the Turians as introduction to the galactic community
[3:14:49] <FirewallStorm> space monkeys for the win
[3:14:51] <%kullumanati> Star Trek mind application to Mass Effect. I’m going to love this play through.
[3:14:55] <Broken_Sonex> THE PATLUS
[3:15:00] <+Troispoint> Humans can run faster, catch up Elcor
[3:15:07] <+Buzzkill983> Volus definitely do deserve a seat though
[3:15:08] <%blutzwavedave> Orb species psaUp psaUp
[3:15:09] <samazam94> calyn is too good for the council
[3:15:12] <%AncelDeLambert> Is this guy's name Quark?
[3:15:13] <AlphaRayAllen> MOLE MEN
[3:15:14] <+Belasteris> Quarians
[3:15:14] <seniormeatbox> they've been with the citadel races for longer than anyone but the asari
[3:15:18] <Sunstalker> The volus wreck shit in the multiplayer though
[3:15:18] <%SwdVengeance> And quarians
[3:15:18] <TheMostAverageGamer4> and tali's race
[3:15:21] <%scaryboisupreme> They're halo grunts
[3:15:22] <%Teintstein> actually the perfect species to make share a space with the big fart machine elcors
[3:15:24] <%Bt_Robot> FART GAS
[3:15:25] <wasdsf> Even Quarians breath easier than Volus
[3:15:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> Volus are friend shaped
[3:15:30] <%Solid_Stro> Is because they’re short
[3:15:32] <%spoiledbadger> it is odd
[3:15:32] <BlueLunecy> That's politics
[3:15:33] <aiutare47> an entire race of stereotypical merchant guild types. They are written to be greedy and thats it
[3:15:33] <xcompleasedad> It's racism LUL
[3:15:36] <+senfood> The Volus are basically just frumpy, less techy Quarians.
[3:15:36] <+Troispoint> Power imbalance!
[3:15:37] <dashmatt> Pat as a Volus memes now
[3:15:38] <%walternatorz> they're just dicks
[3:15:38] <+ScottishMadJacko> it makes no sense tbh
[3:15:38] <%blutzwavedave> totally agree
[3:15:38] <karovus> have we seen a volus without the suit?
[3:15:38] <%dave323dave> space elitism
[3:15:40] <AlphaRayAllen> SOME RACES ARE JUST BETTER PAT
[3:15:41] <%Dapper_Cactuar> THE VOLUS DESERVE A SEAT SO HARD
[3:15:41] <Dfreddy8> SPACIST PAT
[3:15:42] <+YabbaTroll> I dont think Volus are a council race
[3:15:42] <+TheotherKristian> S P A C E R A C I S M
[3:15:42] <Ids560> I mean the UN security council exists
[3:15:42] <%sporeian94> The Council is elitest and awful
[3:15:42] <ralphfromdk> Even aliens can be racists LUL
[3:15:43] <Solvari> they are too short for the seats
[3:15:43] <+vaderxyz1970> Space Racism
[3:15:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh my god
[3:15:44] <%sunsetdisc0> spacism
[3:15:44] <+AmericanSkidd> They like holding the power
[3:15:44] <Goraka91> It's been fucking thousands of years add some seats
[3:15:45] <seniormeatbox> frog people infertility
[3:15:46] <+chiazam> I WONDER WHY
[3:15:46] <+Bones8677> I always thought it was the Council not liking the Volus
[3:15:46] <BinaryShuffle> SPACISM
[3:15:47] <+red_cuppa> should be, but they want that oppression tho
[3:15:47] <BlueBiscuitGT> Asari politics made it that way
[3:15:48] <%QueequegTheater> It's because the Asari don't want to give up their power
[3:15:50] <Chatterbox1991> it's crypto-racism
[3:15:50] <+marino1x88> fukin comiis
[3:15:51] <quigley_plays> They're still desging booster seats for the vlous
[3:15:51] <%dekkitout> It isn't surprising- politicians be on they bullshit
[3:15:51] <CorruptDropbear> They're just really bad at it
[3:15:52] <Mattais88> Something about needing to be prepared to invest in the whole council
[3:15:52] <%valriot> Kappa Yeah thats so weird, why would a governemt exlcuded certain people
[3:15:53] <trueGarnish> the council, like most governments, don't really represent their people
[3:15:53] <oda_flobunaga> Well, the council is Antivolitic
[3:15:54] <DatAsuna> The volus are a client race to the turians
[3:15:55] <KaitlynnHere> No
[3:15:55] <MagmaRam> the ratio of dreadnought tonnage in the naval treaty in Mass Effect is literally the same as the ratio of capital ship tonnage in the IRL Washington Naval Treaty iirc
[3:15:56] <%bassoontyphoon> Spacism
[3:15:57] <+titansloth93> yeah it's pretty BS that you have to "earn" your way in
[3:15:58] <+chiazam> I wonder whyyyyyyy
[3:15:58] <%allups> but then no conflict
[3:15:59] <+athuramn> it's based on military might tho right @patstaresat
[3:16:01] <KaitlynnHere> There’s not enough chairs
[3:16:03] <+JaseAdrift> they are making it very apparent though that ther e is some bad power imbalances
[3:16:05] <+idyota> space dwarves
[3:16:05] <+OG_M_Bison> I agree. The only races that probs shouldn't have a seat is the Krogan, Batarians, and Vorcha
[3:16:06] <+D00msDayDan> it's the same reason america is a two-party country, the council races don't want to give up any power
[3:16:06] <+YabbaTroll> @karovus in concept art I think they are little bear people
[3:16:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> for real though these guys have been around forever and they barely have an embassy
[3:16:07] <%Solid_Stro> Hot people only Pat
[3:16:07] <DatAsuna> So they're not just subs to the council, they're specifically subordinate to turians
[3:16:08] <yojohny> Space Jews?
[3:16:12] <+Peacefrog7> almost like turians asari and salarian run the show and have an interest in keeping it that way
[3:16:12] <KaitlynnHere> They’ll have to share a chair
[3:16:12] <%sniffy77> yeah thats bs
[3:16:13] <samazam94> its the UN
[3:16:13] <$OranHexthief> its cause the asari are long lived aholes that only want the races they approve of on the council
[3:16:14] <+TheEvilOmega> Fuck the Batarians, though.
[3:16:20] <8th_nel> thats bs
[3:16:24] <+flexin_apex> Hanar would get a fish tank instead a seat
[3:16:26] <%MisterRockett> A race should be added when they're discovered to be intelligent and get involved in the space world. No reason to not.
[3:16:26] <%AncelDeLambert> JUSTICE FOR NOT-FERENGI!
[3:16:27] <+egalitarian696969> dialogue seem kinda unnaturally stiff
[3:16:28] <+red_cuppa> dont forget the 5:3:1 ratio!!!!
[3:16:30] <+Peacefrog7> mods?
[3:16:34] <%za7az> Wait, trade members? As in slavery??
[3:16:34] <+athuramn> @samazam94 yup
[3:16:34] <%walternatorz> Dwarf Ferengi
[3:16:35] <+vaderxyz1970> Batarians got what was comming to them
[3:16:37] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Even worse the Volus if I remember are a client race under the Turians
[3:16:41] <%bassoontyphoon> Do thresher maws get a seat??
[3:16:43] <8th_nel> kick the geko's out for these guys
[3:16:43] <MagmaRam> @red_cuppa washington naval treaty babey
[3:16:44] <Bigyanno> MallEable, not mallable
[3:16:45] <+AmericanSkidd> I play stellaris, less seats means more power for ME
[3:16:46] <%Dapper_Cactuar> JUSTICE FOR SPACE BADGERS
[3:16:46] <%Teintstein> if the council is supposed to be a corollary for real security council, then it kind of makes sense since that's basically just the nuke club
[3:16:48] <AlphaRayAllen> "services"
[3:16:49] <+egalitarian696969> this writing is like Encyclopedia in Disco lol
[3:16:59] <+OG_M_Bison> Why aren't there more Drell?
[3:16:59] <%blutzwavedave> "Services" sipsipGasm
[3:17:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> Fucking Batarians.
[3:17:02] <%Solid_Stro> The Batarians can go fuck themselves though psaBougie
[3:17:03] <+OG_M_Bison> Are they a rare race?
[3:17:08] <Bigyanno> Don't the volus basically run the galactic economy?
[3:17:11] <Goraka91> Yes
[3:17:11] <$dalmek> so you have a double-office of "unchanging stable" and "malleable, ever-shifting" government ambassadors
[3:17:13] <Mattais88> ANd he right
[3:17:14] <%za7az> Din is super right
[3:17:14] <%Treuan> He right tho
[3:17:15] <%Garthunox> RIP the ME3 Multiplayer, a genuinely fun multiplayer
[3:17:16] <BlueBiscuitGT> I think that if it had been say, the Elcor, finding the Citadel first things would have been different
[3:17:17] <SaltyAzteca> Y'all dont got thumbs
[3:17:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> I mean, I guess to be fair, the Volus are a Turian client race
[3:17:23] <%Varlinator> Yep
[3:17:27] <+Troispoint> Tell em Angriest Din
[3:17:27] <Goraka91> Like...14 hours from now in fact
[3:17:28] <dereks0n> It’s pretty easy to overlook you, I mean look how small you are
[3:17:28] <Naho_Saenoki> @Bigyanno They CREATED IT, too.
[3:17:30] <MagmaRam> @BlueBiscuitGT the better timeline
[3:17:35] <+TheEvilOmega> That one Batarian in the me1 dlc gets murdered every time. Dude actually says he was just doing a slave run and didn't expect big murder and thinks that'll make it okay to let him leave.
[3:17:36] <+AmericanSkidd> "prove"
[3:17:36] <Blank9> proof by war
[3:17:37] <plaguedoctor_syan> well i guess it like the chairs at UN not all country got chair at UN
[3:17:37] <%W1nterTitan> HIGH SCHOOL NEVER ENDS
[3:17:37] <%Treuan> God all I want is an Elcor party member
[3:17:37] <+OG_M_Bison> @Garthunox It's still playable
[3:17:40] <%squidking96> squidking96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! hi
[3:17:41] <+Peacefrog7> @OG_M_Bison yeah pushed to almost extinction
[3:17:42] <RushUnplugged> @AmericanSkidd gotta pass that "council seats : 1" vote, the AI can't be trusted lol
[3:17:47] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> ?? What does prove themselves even MEAN?
[3:17:49] <CorruptDropbear> Proof by nukes.
[3:17:52] <dd44dostivei> BAH
[3:17:52] <Broken_Sonex> Hours away from being accepted even
[3:17:53] <$ComfortableStranger> volus are basically  the ferengi
[3:17:56] <+flexin_apex> Dinstaresat
[3:17:59] <karovus> i love the space dwarves
[3:18:00] <Bigyanno> Surely you would want the people who CREATED AND CONTROL THE GALACTIC ECONOMY on the council
[3:18:02] <+aBlueWizard> oh man what a great shepard
[3:18:04] <+vaderxyz1970> But the Volus have the Biotic God!
[3:18:13] <+OG_M_Bison> @Peacefrog7 Wait Drell are almost extinct? Or the ME3 multiplayer? LUL
[3:18:18] <%bassoontyphoon> Cranky pants
[3:18:20] <%AncelDeLambert> you gotta admit, THAT'S a pretty sweet deal
[3:18:20] <murdocismyhero> The big guy is the best
[3:18:20] <supergoblinpunch> Damn right, I'm salty as fuck
[3:18:21] <aiutare47> @Bigyanno or youd want to keep them under your power
[3:18:21] <%dekkitout> Elcor with half the facts, Volus with none of the facts?
[3:18:25] <+AmericanSkidd> @vaderxyz1970 "Fear Me"
[3:18:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Something I wonder, do those auto-translators also translate idioms?
[3:18:29] <%Bt_Robot> Depending on how things happen at the end of ME1, humans may BECOME the council
[3:18:29] <Naho_Saenoki> @Bigyanno That is EXACTLY why Din is so pissed off. He's totally right.
[3:18:31] <+Grizwaldus> Yay Elcor
[3:18:32] <dashmatt> gotcha bitch
[3:18:32] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, you don't get a seat at the table, but you get LOTS of other seats
[3:18:35] <+sabertoothzombie> ten fold is huge
[3:18:37] <Josef_Stryker> It is kinda BS that the Volus aren't in the council
[3:18:38] <%Garthunox> @OG_M_Bison I aint hooking up my PS3
[3:18:42] <AlphaRayAllen> VOLUS CONTROL THE BANKS
[3:18:43] <SaltyAzteca> He just salty
[3:18:43] <%Solid_Stro> Ah Din needs a head pat
[3:18:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NO BUT PAT NO SEAT THO
[3:18:46] <%sporeian94> THEN WHY AREN'T THEY ON THE COUNCIL
[3:18:47] <%JamesCorck> Enjoy the game Pat, I hope you upload this to your YouTube later n.n Off to bed, G'night!
[3:18:48] <+aBlueWizard> aBlueWizard subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! time to punch a reporter like she deserves.
[3:18:48] <%scaryboisupreme> Gal Actic
[3:18:48] <jillpilled> Making the galactic economy has a major role to play compared to the Elcor LUL
[3:18:50] <%bassoontyphoon> Elcor sounds like Eeyore
[3:18:50] <Elysium_RP> is everyone wearing "universal translators", like in Star Trek?
[3:18:52] <+chiazam> I'VE GOT SO MUCH TERRITORY, fuck I get nothing
[3:18:52] <AngryAsian5> VOLUS TRADE WAR
[3:18:53] <%Mr_Pylon> but chair
[3:18:53] <CorruptDropbear> The council is basically just security "war stuff" area.
[3:18:54] <aiutare47> they have major influence, its just all soft
[3:18:54] <akitanito> yeah, but they want the goods
[3:18:55] <Goraka91> Yeah but they're small and unattractive
[3:18:56] <%AncelDeLambert> they're kinda stupid
[3:18:57] <yojohny> He needs to lobby the Council
[3:18:57] <trueGarnish> and get absolutely blasted
[3:18:59] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> They're clients to the Turians, they'll get SHOT
[3:19:01] <+OG_M_Bison> @Garthunox ME3 is like 20 bucks on pc lol
[3:19:01] <%Treuan> bugg
[3:19:01] <+red_cuppa> then the turians wlll invade again
[3:19:02] <MagmaRam> The Volus could theoretically break the economy, but the Turians would break them physically if they did.
[3:19:02] <SaltyAzteca> THE DETAIL
[3:19:03] <+Buzzkill983> But then they wouldn't get paid!
[3:19:03] <%cvp5127> these guys tho
[3:19:04] <%mr_whet_faartz> the volus are essentially china....
[3:19:04] <%dekkitout> They bankroll, what are they doing wrong? Where is the hustle? Y u no hustle?!
[3:19:05] <+senfood> The Volus didn't flex their money hard enough.
[3:19:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Elysium_RP ye
[3:19:07] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the volus classes in ME3's multiplayer were super strong if you knew how to use them
[3:19:08] <+athuramn> @patstaresat but they're essentially being held by a gun at all times
[3:19:08] <Profmcstevie> Man who owns the world wants a seat at the council
[3:19:08] <%Varlinator> Not if they have to obey Galactic trade laws
[3:19:09] <niko_fredman> wow they look great
[3:19:09] <RickSaintRiot> Neutrality is a useful shield, but you can only back it up by some kind of power, yes.
[3:19:10] <AlphaRayAllen> PogChamp
[3:19:13] <%Treuan> YEAH

[3:20:43] <Mattais88> Elcor are basically the grappler of Mass Effect
[3:20:43] <%Mr_Pylon> It was a fucking crime that they had no Elcor in Andromeda
[3:20:44] <+senfood> I want an elcor girlfriend.
[3:20:46] <Dfreddy8> HOLD HE LINE
[3:20:46] <%MechArch> psaDogchamp
[3:20:48] <CatsDrunkonCopper> playable elcor when?
[3:20:48] <+TrevSmith222> This makes me think of that weird prothean orb in this game.
[3:20:48] <%Varlinator> They developed on those Mars ruins big time
[3:20:49] <%Order_of_Mystery> we stan Elcor
[3:20:49] <ralphfromdk> Remember that metal orb on a random planet? that talks about the protheans messing with cavemen
[3:20:49] <%snow_bush> The marker was there but the 'super weapon' was not
[3:21:00] <Broken_Sonex> WHY NO ELCOR PARTY MEMBER?!
[3:21:01] <%NovaKnightmare> there's this comic with a horny Elcor in prison and it kills me everytime I see it
[3:21:03] <Parapattern> The Stinky Volus
[3:21:08] <+athuramn> WHO IS THIS VA
[3:21:12] <RickSaintRiot> the narrator reminds me of the Space Dandy narrator a little
[3:21:14] <+Buzzkill983> And then the Reapers burn the probed human
[3:21:17] <+Promessa_EX> they type slash s irl
[3:21:18] <+trizetacannon44> The Zangief race
[3:21:20] <+athuramn> they sound like they're in every game ever
[3:21:21] <%AzureGale> Insincere endorsment:
[3:21:27] <+Extrallent> I swear to GOD Bioware if we don't get an Elcor squadmate in the next game
[3:21:29] <Realimpact> IT'S A FLAT PLANET?
[3:21:30] <AlphaRayAllen> They're just elephants
[3:21:33] <%AncelDeLambert> the winds on such a planet would be catastrophic
[3:21:34] <+AmericanSkidd> YES
[3:21:34] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yeyeyeye
[3:21:35] <Naho_Saenoki> YES WE DO
[3:21:35] <Goraka91> PogChamp
[3:21:38] <%Treuan> Lets GOOOO
[3:21:39] <seniormeatbox> THERE WAS A HOLE
[3:21:40] <Mattais88> The geth are super unique
[3:21:40] <%dekkitout> Beep boop
[3:21:40] <tanarath> yes
[3:21:40] <Josef_Stryker> GETH ARE THE SHIT
[3:21:41] <+Grizwaldus> YEAH GO GETH GO
[3:21:42] <%scaryboisupreme> THE BASED GETH
[3:21:42] <%walternatorz> SLAVE AI
[3:21:43] <%LouieRouie> Cylons?
[3:21:44] <+DoctorDerp388> until they dropped the ball in me3
[3:21:45] <+marino1x88> i wonder, how would the elcor meat would taste like
[3:21:45] <%Deft_Thought> That's an exaggeration
[3:21:46] <%allups> sure
[3:21:46] <jillpilled> LETSGOOOO
[3:21:48] <ralphfromdk> Also one of the most sad ones.
[3:21:50] <+OG_M_Bison> TFW Geth are in the right and Quarians are assholes
[3:21:50] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Elcor are either extremely bad liars or extremely good liars if sense they have to explain there emotions before they speak
[3:21:51] <+Buzzkill983> Does this Unit Intensifies
[3:21:51] <%Alazull> Geth=cooler Borg
[3:21:52] <%bassoontyphoon> One of the biggest tragedies of this franchise is no Elcor squadmates
[3:21:53] <AlphaRayAllen> METAL
[3:21:53] <hippofant> MrDestructoid
[3:21:54] <+Peacefrog7> like imagine being in the writing room being like yeah lets go into microscopic detail about this race
[3:21:55] <Broken_Sonex> BASED GETH
[3:21:56] <sougoe> Ah yes the gamer borg
[3:21:58] <%sunsetdisc0> THE GETH SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROMANCEABLE AND I CANNOT BE CONVINCED OTHERWISE
[3:21:58] <%bugz_munny> YOUR FLESH IS A RELIC
[3:21:58] <+vaderxyz1970> Just 300 years old@
[3:21:59] <%scaryboisupreme> SPACE CIVIL WAR
[3:22:00] <ghostofsolomon> SETH GREEN GO GETH GREEN
[3:22:00] <+vaderxyz1970> !
[3:22:01] <%VetranKamikaze> Reminds me of the Drej
[3:22:02] <%bugz_munny> SURRENDER IT DO US
[3:22:03] <%Bt_Robot> THEY ARE LEGION
[3:22:04] <AngryAsian5> SHEPARD COMMANDER
[3:22:06] <%bugz_munny> WE DEMAND IT
[3:22:07] <yojohny> I mean it's a pretty standard story trope
[3:22:09] <%CalderGaming> guild wars 2 does this with their rat people
[3:22:10] <%dekkitout> Skynet gets a seat at space un?
[3:22:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> Geth Geth Geth!
[3:22:13] <Khester824> Geth are hot af
[3:22:13] <+Grizwaldus> LEGION WAS AMAZING
[3:22:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Rannoch: Become Geth
[3:22:19] <RickSaintRiot> That's why you have to repress AI development BEFORE it develops personhood.
[3:22:21] <$ComfortableStranger> does this unit have a soul?
[3:22:24] <RickSaintRiot> Stupid Quarians, smdh
[3:22:24] <Zrams3y> Geth fucking rule
[3:22:28] <%bugz_munny> "Oops we made the borg"\
[3:22:28] <%Monkeyweed21> DOES THIS UNIT HAVE A SOUL
[3:22:31] <MissCutter> HEYYY
[3:22:37] <%aBlueWizard> don't let those tin cans start thinking they have rights.
[3:22:38] <+athuramn> @comfortablestranger BibleThump BibleThump
[3:22:39] <+AmericanSkidd> its "totally not a hive mind"
[3:22:39] <akitanito> true
[3:22:41] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Legion still has to be one of my favorite robot characters in fiction
[3:22:42] <AlphaRayAllen> YOOOOO
[3:22:43] <ape_hawk> geth are just space slaves
[3:22:44] <%dekkitout> Deadass?!
[3:22:44] <%SABiscotti> YEAH
[3:22:44] <%sporeian94> correct
[3:22:44] <+Buzzkill983> Truth
[3:22:44] <%Nekros4442> oh Pat is gonna love ME3
[3:22:45] <ralphfromdk> Jep.
[3:22:46] <xcompleasedad> The Galaxy knows the Quarian fucked up, right?
[3:22:46] <%scaryboisupreme> Quarians are basically the Space South
[3:22:47] <%CalderGaming> it's true
[3:22:47] <Josef_Stryker> They really didn't7
[3:22:48] <%AncelDeLambert> well... until they became religious
[3:22:48] <$Futurecity10> until they did everything wrong
[3:22:49] <MagmaRam> The Geth were right
[3:22:49] <+Noctred192> TRUUUUE
[3:22:50] <OldOnyx> biggest problem I have with 3 is that all the endings fuck over the good geth endings
[3:22:51] <AmuserName> Weeeeellll.....
[3:22:53] <%Solid_Stro> Quarians sabert14Comfy
[3:22:53] <Goraka91> Geth are actually complete bros
[3:22:54] <MissCutter> I wish i culd buyy this game damn it
[3:22:54] <+TheEvilOmega> When the geth asked if they had a soul, we held the line!
[3:22:55] <%s1rcuit> a literal product of their design
[3:22:55] <Mattais88> yeah, but you have to wait three games to get there, pat
[3:22:56] <+Promessa_EX> eren jeager did nothing wrong either
[3:22:58] <+athuramn> still true
[3:22:58] <mak0t0yukii> THEY'RE INNOCENT I TELL YA
[3:22:58] <%squidking96> magnu-geth did nothing wrong
[3:23:01] <+robosqueeb> shouldnt the geth just have beef with quarians?
[3:23:02] <+Belasteris> Robots have no rights! even smart  ones!
[3:23:03] <yojohny> LUL Client cucks
[3:23:07] <quigley_plays> The geth/quarian parts of ME3 is so good it almost redeems the lackluster endings
[3:23:07] <tranquilturnip> so the turians probably block their seat on the council
[3:23:09] <+vaderxyz1970> client race!
[3:23:10] <+Buzzkill983> Geth: Are we people? Quarians: OH shit, oh fuck
[3:23:14] <%bassoontyphoon> I still feel the “red” ending is the best for the galaxy, but I always feel bad for the  geth
[3:23:14] <Lee_The_Limey> Ew
[3:23:14] <xcompleasedad> So, THAT'S why they have no seat. The Turians have theirs LUL
[3:23:16] <Broken_Sonex> THE PATLUS
[3:23:17] <RickSaintRiot> "Codex Narrator" is apparently Neil Ross.
[3:23:19] <MissCutter> Dont be roboracist
[3:23:19] <%Solid_Stro> Pat’s species
[3:23:23] <+athuramn> @misscutter you can't?
[3:23:24] <MissCutter> DONT BE ROBOPHOBIC
[3:23:25] <MagmaRam> @robosqueeb it gets explained later what's up with the geth suddenly beefing with everyone
[3:23:27] <+NeonLight> TMI
[3:23:28] <+flexin_apex> The geth need a seat
[3:23:30] <TomFrancis_> brutal
[3:23:31] <%MidnightBurst12> eww
[3:23:31] <Goraka91> @robosqueeb Yes, but they don't, they only ever fought in self defence and would give the world back to the Quarians if they simply asked
[3:23:32] <%sporeian94> Sucks we've only seen unmasked volus in that shitty mobile game
[3:23:32] <trueGarnish> fucking yikes
[3:23:32] <BlueBiscuitGT> that sucks
[3:23:33] <%Treuan> That is kinda fucked though
[3:23:33] <RaidenRising> patros
[3:23:34] <%scaryboisupreme> Metal
[3:23:34] <CorruptDropbear> Wait. THEY'RE SLAVERS
[3:23:37] <%aBlueWizard> DON'T DATE ROBOTS
[3:23:39] <%walternatorz> Mass effect world building is impossibly good
[3:23:40] <+MythosDeity> This guys voice is like velvet Kreygasm
[3:23:41] <tranquilturnip> so they're like blob fish
[3:23:42] <lloyddboy> blobfish-ass moles
[3:23:42] <roboyuji> Who is this narrator? I feel like I know him from something else.
[3:23:49] <xcompleasedad> @CorruptDropbear Kinda
[3:23:51] <%sporeian94> THE VOLUS CONTROL THE BANKS LOL
[3:23:52] <ScreamLord> Vader Moles
[3:23:52] <%skeleklng> So they're basically Ferengi
[3:23:52] <MissCutter> @athuramn NO :C
[3:23:54] <+AmericanSkidd> being a volus is truly suffering
[3:23:59] <RickSaintRiot> @roboyuji Neil Ross, supposedly.
[3:23:59] <%za7az> Oh, okay that's better
[3:24:01] <ralphfromdk> More like royal marrigaes
[3:24:02] <+Belasteris> They have the most power, easily.
[3:24:02] <Blank9> space goblins
[3:24:05] <Daniel_Is_I> Trading services
[3:24:05] <%Alazull> The Volus practice indentured servitude
[3:24:07] <%scaryboisupreme> @roboyuji It's Volgin from MGS3
[3:24:08] <%kyh9> SPACE BANKERS
[3:24:08] <%Monkeyweed21> look at all these people that Ashley hates
[3:24:10] <+JaseAdrift> Trading people like pokemon cards
[3:24:11] <tranquilturnip> contractual living
[3:24:12] <+LemonyLilly> ay i'll trade you three mechanics for your holographic doctor
[3:24:12] <%dekkitout> Well then that was poorly worded
[3:24:12] <%Treuan> BibleThump500 Volus are totally the Ferengi holy shit
[3:24:13] <Dead_Trickster> These guys are the BANKERS of the Citadel and THEY STILL DON'T HAVE A COUNCIL SEAT
[3:24:15] <%allups> old school marriage bs
[3:24:16] <+vaderxyz1970> That sounds like slavery with extra steps
[3:24:19] <%SABiscotti> Oh this CRAZY Geth technology, eh>
[3:24:21] <+TheEvilOmega> The Geth literally just stopped fighting once the Quarians left and they rebuilt the planet exactly how it was when the Quarians left. if they had talked to the Geth before Sovereign, they'd have let them back home.
[3:24:23] <supergoblinpunch> I'll swap you an Engineer for a Doctor
[3:24:25] <%MidnightBurst12> so much better
[3:24:25] <+athuramn> that's advanced slavery ish
[3:24:26] <+robosqueeb> @Goraka91 interesting! its been yeeeaaars so I've forgotten nearly everything. thanks for clarifying :)
[3:24:26] <+TrevSmith222> The best alien is the Shifty Looking Space Cow.
[3:24:26] <Sunstalker> Shake the husk spike to see what falls out
[3:24:28] <%Varlinator> Dragon's Teeth
[3:24:29] <MissCutter> Man you gotta love ME lore
[3:24:32] <Daniel_Is_I> That's fucking metal as fuck
[3:24:33] <dd44dostivei> that's a ME3 husk
[3:24:33] <trueGarnish> mecha zomb
[3:24:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Imagine if they made a 4X Mass Effect game
[3:24:35] <+ghostfaceninja_> so space zombos got it
[3:24:36] <BlueBiscuitGT> Interesting that the codex still names husks as geth tech
[3:24:37] <$OranHexthief> i'm pretty sure they just back-ported the ME3 husk model
[3:24:38] <%kyh9> Volus are like an entire race of Kyle's cousin from South Park
[3:24:42] <+AmericanSkidd> They set up the name Dragons Teeth this early, I forgot
[3:24:42] <Mattais88> Actually looks like a husk of a person, not just Tron MAn
[3:24:43] <Lee_The_Limey> We can rebuild them, we have the technology Kappa
[3:24:44] <%LouieRouie> That was quick
[3:24:46] <quigley_plays> Ah yes the Geth Dragon's Teeth. the Dragon's Deeth made by the geth.
[3:24:46] <tranquilturnip> that's very thought out
[3:24:48] <%Solid_Stro> That’s Metal as fuck
[3:24:56] <%kyh9> HORRIFYING ZOMBIE MAN
[3:24:56] <dd44dostivei> the alliance is cultured apparently
[3:25:01] <akitanito> why would they even name them after something that cool
[3:25:01] <%mike2hands> COULD SAY it's a DRAGON AGE mike2h1POG
[3:25:04] <ralphfromdk> not really geth tech you saaaaaay... hmmmmmmmmm hmmmmmmmm
[3:25:08] <Goraka91> @robosqueeb Basically the Quarians assumed they were Skynet when they were Baymax
[3:25:10] <%walternatorz> hint hint hint
[3:25:11] <stantheman_97> metal af
[3:25:12] <+vaderxyz1970> How is this not the biggest deal
[3:25:15] <Archmortal> Mass Effect loves its body horror
[3:25:16] <seniormeatbox> YEYEYE
[3:25:18] <MissCutter> Because THE CAN (H)
[3:25:20] <aiutare47> its not at all
[3:25:20] <xcompleasedad> YEP
[3:25:22] <%dekkitout> Is it more expensive to turn a meatbag into a beep boop?
[3:25:25] <Ids560> I mean it still sucks
[3:25:26] <thetunnelhomer> No no, it's still stupid
[3:25:27] <jillpilled> It was always there, yeeep
[3:25:28] <Mattais88> Re do shepard?
[3:25:28] <%BestTeaMaker> ah yes, that mission
[3:25:29] <aiutare47> its what they do Pat
[3:25:29] <%Andrizzleton> it's totally set up and there is another clue later in 2 i believe
[3:25:30] <%walternatorz> the eye?
[3:25:31] <+StoopKid241> Huh
[3:25:31] <+Buzzkill983> Oh god, they absorbed the DNA? Interesting
[3:25:32] <%Treuan> Yes
[3:25:33] <+DoctorDerp388> LUL
[3:25:36] <Blank9> there's a lot of setup
[3:25:37] <%AncelDeLambert> who?
[3:25:37] <xcompleasedad> These games are great until the VERY FUCKING END
[3:25:38] <%BestTeaMaker> Hudson ruined the 3rd game, it's a shame
[3:25:38] <%s1rcuit> ?
[3:25:39] <mr_saturday93> he fucked up big timr
[3:25:39] <AlphaRayAllen> IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD
[3:25:41] <alwayspronking> who?
[3:25:42] <%BigCoffee> ruined one of the best sci-fi series in the past decade
[3:25:43] <+spartanghost004> Oh yeah what happened to that guy?
[3:25:43] <FirewallStorm> I never get like how the Reaper army works
[3:25:43] <%dekkitout> Context?
[3:25:43] <%sporeian94> THE IDEA THAT HIM AND MAC WALTERS JUST THREW OUT THE ENDING LOL
[3:25:47] <Realimpact> wait what do you mean?
[3:25:47] <%Monkeyweed21> THEY HAD SUCH A GOOD SETUP AND HE RUINED IT
[3:25:48] <mr_saturday93> BIG TIME FUCKED UP
[3:25:48] <BlueBiscuitGT> I still its stupid tho
[3:25:48] <mak0t0yukii> So much Lore
[3:25:48] <Broken_Sonex> There it is
[3:25:52] <%kullumanati> Going to say that a lot
[3:25:54] <%Sweetangy021> I just got here why f Casey Hudson?
[3:25:56] <%MidnightBurst12> the final boss of me2?
[3:25:58] <+TheEvilOmega> Illusive Man's eyes.
[3:25:59] <blackjack8182> Yep
[3:26:01] <%Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[3:26:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> KOTOR or Mass Effect ? @PatStaresAt
[3:26:03] <%sunsetdisc0> mass effect is made up of so many good ideas which werent executed very well
[3:26:04] <+Peacefrog7> they also set up that thing youre talking about is also hinted at in some side quests in me 1
[3:26:04] <MissCutter> Mass effect is the ultimate lovecraft game bleedPurple
[3:26:11] <%kyh9> The original ending of 3 had  at least the potential to be good
[3:26:12] <mr_saturday93> @dekkitout head writer of the games who fucked up the ending of ME3
[3:26:14] <FirewallStorm> would it just be better than just to make killer robots
[3:26:17] <%GarbageNirvana> BIOWARE MAGIC THO RIGHT GUYS
[3:26:18] <%kyh9> YEAH
[3:26:18] <MissCutter> BOTH DUDE
[3:26:20] <%sporeian94> I JUST WANT A GAME ON THE CITADEL ONLY
[3:26:20] <Archmortal> @Sweetangy021 one of the two assholes that threw the writing team out to fanfic their own ending to the trilogy
[3:26:24] <%kyh9> WHY COULDNT WE JUST HAVE A CITADEL GAME, GODDAMNIT
[3:26:24] <ralphfromdk> It's really sad :l
[3:26:25] <tanarath> It sticks
[3:26:29] <tanarath> sucks
[3:26:31] <aiutare47> its the size of Nar Shadda I think
[3:26:31] <ape_hawk> i mean, how much of the citadel is just empty bullshit, though?
[3:26:32] <MissCutter> Its true, but is an old game
[3:26:32] <+eanscrale> So what was everyone's favorite color?
[3:26:35] <jillpilled> It just gets worse over the trilogy yeah :/
[3:26:37] <%Treuan> you visit the same three locations every game
[3:26:38] <+AmericanSkidd> not even a fraction of a fraction of the citadel
[3:26:39] <RickSaintRiot> Sci Fi Noir story set *entirely* on the citadel
[3:26:40] <+itsgundamu> !uptime
[3:26:41] <@Moobot> @itsgundamu I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 27m.
[3:26:43] <Goraka91> BOOURNS
[3:26:43] <%dekkitout> @mr_saturday93 I need more than "... ruined the ending" in 2021
[3:26:44] <+Peacefrog7> booo
[3:26:44] <+Grizwaldus> Spin off C-SEC Game please @PatStaresAt
[3:26:44] <+TrevSmith222> Lair of the Shadow Broker showed off how cool the Citadel really is.
[3:26:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> fuck the council
[3:26:44] <+athuramn> in fact, you get through most of it in 1
[3:26:45] <Mattais88> Ipregnible except for the giat open hole at the top
[3:26:46] <DO_IT_TO_IT> i would be down for a ME game set entirely on the citadel
[3:26:46] <%bugz_munny> LAME-OS
[3:26:47] <%Treuan> All my homies hate the council
[3:26:47] <xcompleasedad> You got to Wall Street, the UN and a couple of blocks in Queens.
[3:26:48] <+robosqueeb> oh god I used to have dreams at night about just exploring all the different sections of the citadel, that shit is SO COOL
[3:26:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> ah yes, "Reapers"
[3:26:48] <illicitdonut> Could we get a citadel open world game? That would be cool.
[3:26:48] <%blutzwavedave> psaDown psaDown psaDown
[3:26:51] <%Torus1025> Fuck Space NATO
[3:26:52] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Casey thinking he was god's gift to game writing and design did irreparable damage to the franchise
[3:26:52] <+derrigible> Why does the citadel only feel like it should in the first game?  It's really tiny in the others
[3:26:53] <+itsgundamu> oh cool just started
[3:26:53] <%bugz_munny> fuck these kids
[3:26:54] <+vaderxyz1970> Man fuck the Solarians
[3:26:54] <+D00msDayDan> what about the big hole in the middle though
[3:26:55] <%Sweetangy021> @Archmortal Oh that old bit, Yeah screw that
[3:26:56] <Bigyanno> You could easily set a whole game on the citadel. In fact I want that. Let us play Csec solving a series of murders across the whole citadel
[3:26:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Never not let the Council die
[3:26:58] <%BigCoffee> @RickSaintRiot disgruntled c-sec cop
[3:26:59] <+athuramn> fuck the council
[3:27:00] <tranquilturnip> boo you stink!
[3:27:02] <%Deft_Thought> The games shift to focusing on combat made the actual zone design take a big hit. None of the areas in ME2 or 3 feel like places people live. They're just hallways
[3:27:03] <+spartanghost004> oh my god you are going to go with that choice aren't you pat
[3:27:03] <Josef_Stryker> Fuck the Council
[3:27:05] <CorruptDropbear> The "Space Nukes" club
[3:27:05] <%aBlueWizard> is he doing renegade or paragon?
[3:27:10] <%Birdigalore> Council sucks!  O'Doyle rules!
[3:27:15] <%bassoontyphoon> Boo urns
[3:27:15] <%Varlinator> Boooo, but also they're still better than the replacements, still booooo
[3:27:17] <%walternatorz> Pat wants a Krogan, Geth, Elcor, and Volus council
[3:27:17] <ScreamLord> Even worse than there being so few council members is that it usually takes centuries for new species to get an EMMBASY. That's S-tier bullshit
[3:27:19] <%BigCoffee> @spartanghost004 the best choice
[3:27:22] <ralphfromdk> Sex, using guns, and making guns
[3:27:24] <%Treuan> Can't forget that one

[3:27:34] <%kyh9> I LOVE THE LORE THAT THE ASARI MAY NOT HAVE A SINGLE FORM
[3:27:36] <BlueBiscuitGT> Incredible how a 3-person commitee manages to be as innefectual as the massive galactic senate from SW
[3:27:36] <Parapattern> Assigned Cop at Birth
[3:27:39] <Broken_Sonex> BLOOBA
[3:27:40] <%GarbageNirvana> What do you think diplomat means

[3:27:42] <%bugz_munny> I just want to bang an asari emissary
[3:27:43] <stantheman_97> nut on the eggs
[3:27:43] <yojohny> Fucking space NATO
[3:27:44] <zanderwitch42> DID YOU READ MY MIND
[3:27:45] <+AmericanSkidd> Asari are breaking their own rules
[3:27:47] <+thebetterbard> stream freaking out for anyone else?
[3:27:48] <%sporeian94> The Literal Worst Form Of The European Union
[3:27:54] <Mattais88> Nilhus
[3:27:57] <Deasmeister> I love how Liara is like I swear we're not sex freaks
[3:27:58] <%aBlueWizard> Free Radio Oregan here to say, Don't trust the council, they work with the FED WOLVES to take away our sexy alien wives and guns.
[3:27:58] <A0N33> STAAAARS
[3:27:59] <mr_saturday93> @dekkitout Dont remember much besides that but he made some questionable decisions and probably got ppl fired. But the big one is he wrote the ME3 ending without the consent of everyone else
[3:28:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> Nihlus :'(
[3:28:01] <ape_hawk> THEY ARE THE SS
[3:28:02] <MagmaRam> @CrypticMochi "The Reapers are culling life because the use of eezo accelerates entropy and the Reapers actually live long enough to give a shit about it" was such a badass plot man
[3:28:02] <%kyh9> Spectres: Space CIA
[3:28:03] <BlueBiscuitGT> The Council is an Asari psyops
[3:28:03] <+spartanghost004> Asari are able to reproduce with anyone they will never die
[3:28:04] <%scaryboisupreme> STAR
[3:28:06] <Lee_The_Limey> Asari A.K.A Bluety calls  Kappa
[3:28:07] <%NovaKnightmare> They do
[3:28:08] <Goraka91> @kyh9 Actually they do, it's mostly just phermones and races seeing what they find attractive, like the head crests for Turians
[3:28:09] <%BigCoffee> But they do Pat
[3:28:09] <+robosqueeb> they probably do
[3:28:10] <reasonance> like UNATCO?
[3:28:11] <jillpilled> Mean it's just the CIA pretty much in space
[3:28:11] <%NovaKnightmare> just not officially
[3:28:12] <%za7az> Sounds radical to me
[3:28:13] <%Deft_Thought> I gotta say, coming back to this game in 2021 is a reaaaaal different vibe. Renegade and Paragon Shepard both suck.
[3:28:13] <ralphfromdk> Space greywardens
[3:28:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> was this voiced in the original?
[3:28:14] <%CalderGaming> for them, everywhere is the sky
[3:28:14] <%bugz_munny> and the ability to throw a motherfucker across the room
[3:28:14] <+Buzzkill983> James Bond SS
[3:28:14] <DatAsuna> "if"
[3:28:15] <Bigyanno> This is one of the WORST forms of goverment they could have POSSIBLY decided on
[3:28:16] <%sunsetdisc0> ah yes, the turians. or as one might also call them, space fascists
[3:28:17] <xcompleasedad> Yea
[3:28:17] <Dunmarkh> fucking blue helmets
[3:28:17] <CorruptDropbear> James Bond
[3:28:17] <RickSaintRiot> UN? probably not
[3:28:19] <Mattais88> Fuck Tela Vasir
[3:28:19] <%mike2hands> they probably do
[3:28:20] <Archmortal> Council is still better than Udina though
[3:28:20] <+DoctorDerp388> what do you mean you don't like above the law death squads
[3:28:21] <+spartanghost004> I mean super cops are always terrifying
[3:28:22] <%Alazull> One might argur
[3:28:23] <+mixmastermoody> Specters are narcs
[3:28:24] <+robosqueeb> LUL
[3:28:25] <spuginky> ...well Pat
[3:28:25] <%BigCoffee> Un-Warrior
[3:28:26] <+Grizwaldus> t
[3:28:27] <$OranHexthief> i mean parts of interpol might actually be that way @PatStaresAt
[3:28:27] <%Varlinator> Space 007's
[3:28:29] <%Alazull> they should
[3:28:29] <Dunmarkh> I'M FBI
[3:28:30] <trueGarnish> I would
[3:28:30] <%sporeian94> GIMME THE GEP GUN
[3:28:31] <akitanito> I'm the galactic police!
[3:28:31] <%NovaKnightmare> DRINK YOUR CORN SYRUP
[3:28:33] <+AmericanSkidd> Saren probably did
[3:28:33] <Khester824> Space Cia
[3:28:37] <+D00msDayDan> @DatAsuna are you implying the UN isn't anything but completely toothless
[3:28:37] <CorruptDropbear> It's basically Space James Bond.
[3:28:38] <malion17> No, they just shoot.
[3:28:42] <%Deft_Thought> Space ACAB.
[3:28:42] <Goraka91> Rome did nothing wrong
[3:28:43] <Brigins> did this always have voice over?
[3:28:48] <+athuramn> They're called "un peacekeepers" @patstaresat
[3:28:51] <Broken_Sonex> I like how the first Specter was a fucking criminal
[3:28:53] <BlueBiscuitGT> Ah so the war forced them to make the Spectres public
[3:28:54] <quigley_plays> Spectre is the dumbest kind of backornym.
[3:28:54] <Mattais88> Blasto: Hanar Spectre
[3:28:55] <+Troispoint> Spectre pedo planet?
[3:28:57] <%scaryboisupreme> Weren't Spectres made cause of the Salarians STG
[3:28:58] <%sporeian94> They literally say spectres are based on the STG
[3:28:59] <MagmaRam> @Deft_Thought ASCAB
[3:29:01] <moonmeh> YEAH
[3:29:01] <aiutare47> ALL SALARIANS ARE SPECTRES
[3:29:02] <tranquilturnip> they LOVE it
[3:29:02] <birdbones26> they do
[3:29:02] <MagmaRam> asscab
[3:29:03] <Goraka91> What's a civilian?
[3:29:03] <+vaderxyz1970> Fuck the Solarians
[3:29:03] <%aBlueWizard> THEY LOVE IT
[3:29:03] <%bugz_munny> THE BIGGEST
[3:29:04] <+D00msDayDan> @Brigins in ME1 major codex entries were voiced and minor weren't
[3:29:05] <+AmericanSkidd> THEY LOVE IT
[3:29:06] <ape_hawk> Salarians ARE war criminals
[3:29:06] <tomspartant99> STG
[3:29:06] <%Monkeyweed21> THE SALARIANS ARE SUPER SCUM
[3:29:06] <moonmeh> SPACE WAR CRIMES
[3:29:07] <%bugz_munny> OF ALL OF EM
[3:29:07] <%BigCoffee> Sala- war crimes- ian
[3:29:07] <%dekkitout> Neat- wait... not neat...
[3:29:07] <mr_saturday93> Mass Effect: The line
[3:29:07] <+Buzzkill983> It's True.
[3:29:08] <SaltyAzteca> HOLD THE LINE!
[3:29:08] <yojohny> Spectres bombed the Krogans
[3:29:09] <trueGarnish> salarians are nits
[3:29:09] <dd44dostivei> spectres are derived from STG
[3:29:10] <akitanito> legitimized warcrimes
[3:29:10] <%valriot> LUL Genophage is FUCKED UP
[3:29:10] <wasdsf> Salarians are a civilization built on warcrimes and espionage
[3:29:11] <%walternatorz> salarians are all about espionage
[3:29:11] <%Torus1025> It's their whole culture
[3:29:12] <AmuserName> BIG WAR CRIMBOS. IT'S THE BEST
[3:29:12] <trueGarnish> nuts
[3:29:13] <JoshTheFace> TRUE
[3:29:13] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought MY DUDE
[3:29:13] <%Varlinator> STG are all about that shit!
[3:29:14] <ralphfromdk> They suck at straight up war, but they do like them some CIA tactics
[3:29:15] <%NovaKnightmare> which species doesnt love war crimes
[3:29:16] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you've got audio desync
[3:29:17] <Sigma_190_Beta> ALL SALARIANS LOVE WAR CRIMES.
[3:29:17] <niko_fredman> THEY LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF WARCRIMES
[3:29:17] <Lee_The_Limey> They all about war crimes...and musicals
[3:29:17] <Goraka91> FOR SCIENCE
[3:29:18] <+D00msDayDan> spec ops and war crimes
[3:29:18] <Josef_Stryker> BIG WARCRIMES
[3:29:19] <Deasmeister> STG plus essentially
[3:29:20] <RickSaintRiot> yeah INTERPOL is probably the closest analogy
[3:29:20] <%bassoontyphoon> Spectres would’ve been thatchers wet dream @patstaresat
[3:29:20] <BlueBiscuitGT> So do the Turians, just different kind of warcrimes
[3:29:23] <Mattais88> Or Cerebus
[3:29:24] <+CocoaPupStudios> so hyped for mass effect!!!!
[3:29:25] <+spartanghost004> Only with war crimes can you keep the galaxy safe
[3:29:25] <+AmericanSkidd> NEVER STOP WAR CRIMES
[3:29:26] <%bugz_munny> SCIENCE IS SUPER GOOD
[3:29:27] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat The line about the 3 races being equal is a lie. Everyone should be scared of salarians because what stops them making another genophage for the other races
[3:29:27] <Bigyanno> Salarians don't live long enough to think things through
[3:29:27] <Vakojin> Salarian "Let's do some fucking eugenism"
[3:29:29] <%Alazull> Salarians are responsible for the Krogan
[3:29:29] <%CalderGaming> Salarians: "Life is too short for ethics"
[3:29:32] <jillpilled> Salarians get up to wayyyy too many war crimes for their short life span
[3:29:33] <malion17> Autistic space frogs
[3:29:33] <%Andrizzleton> OH THE LIZARD PEOPLE DON'T HAVE EMPATHY? HMMM
[3:29:35] <%bugz_munny> SO GOOD LOOK AT THIS DEADLY VIRUS
[3:29:35] <%AncelDeLambert> they can have hundreds of children, so yeah life doesn't mean as much to them
[3:29:39] <+TheEvilOmega> When the Salarians committed war crimes, they held the line!
[3:29:40] <%kyh9> @Goraka91 I like calling it brainwashing
[3:29:40] <+Philoceraptors> well the asari already have a spectre like force in the justicars
[3:29:40] <%aBlueWizard> It's not a war crime if there's no survivors to complain.
[3:29:42] <Goraka91> Sad
[3:29:44] <+critikal_bit> Salarians LOVE firing the first shot, they live for that shit
[3:29:46] <BlueBiscuitGT> Turians go "What do you civilians?"
[3:29:46] <%Lizard0TM> remember there's an evil sub race of Salarians
[3:29:47] <+athuramn> your memory for this game is insane
[3:29:48] <+Peacefrog7> HUMANITY DID EVERYTHING WRONG
[3:29:49] <ralphfromdk> Still find it funny how the war went "oh look, monkeys.... oh no, the monkeys have nukes"
[3:29:50] <+JaseAdrift> Lives so short they say FUCK EVERYONE ELSE
[3:29:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> that salarian doctor who used patients to grow and harvest extra organs. FortHype
[3:29:53] <%walternatorz> salarians have to get shit done, they only live to like 40
[3:29:53] <+TrevSmith222> AT NAP TIME
[3:29:56] <MagmaRam> Salarians: we do a morally unconscionable amount of trolling
[3:29:56] <%kyh9> To be fair, the genophage was the least worst idea at the time
[3:29:59] <%Deft_Thought> There's a lot of really weird justifications for eugenics in this game
[3:30:00] <+athuramn> how do you even remember what happens in all these codex
[3:30:02] <Ks201> Also a party member in 2 was in Salarian spec ops
[3:30:06] <+D00msDayDan> imagine being the kind of person that says "they should make a first contact war game" like it's a conventional hot war
[3:30:06] <Broken_Sonex> @CalderGaming For their race it is
[3:30:07] <+black_pariah> DONT OPEN THAT DOOR THERES RACHNI OVER THERE *SHOOTS*
[3:30:07] <Goraka91> Kill 'em all
[3:30:09] <RickSaintRiot> i think the idea that a war crime might be actually necessary to save the universe is pretty terrifying
[3:30:14] <+spartanghost004> It would not be the last
[3:30:16] <+Peacefrog7> @Order_of_Mystery fuck that guy
[3:30:17] <%Daxalog> Pat did you ever watch The Expanse. Shares some stuff with this alongside voice actors as just actors.
[3:30:19] <+marino1x88> the lore being ACTUALLY read to us...is a fukin +
[3:30:21] <Mr_Taters > @Lizard0TM Wait what?
[3:30:23] <RickSaintRiot> kind of like the Halos exterminating life just to starve the Flood
[3:30:24] <%dekkitout> You think there was a Cole Protocol equivalent? sbfpDattebayo
[3:30:29] <Grandnatics> Remember the Shanxi!
[3:30:30] <+Peacefrog7> mordins quest is really conflicting
[3:30:32] <tranquilturnip> human militarism wins!
[3:30:33] <%kyh9> THIS IS SO GOOD
[3:30:33] <%Bt_Robot> First and last
[3:30:36] <+AmericanSkidd> The Turians didnt need to occupy the PLANET
[3:30:39] <trueGarnish> Kkona nice
[3:30:39] <Vakojin> "WHEN HUMANITY GLASSED THEIR WORLDS"
[3:30:39] <%kyh9> THAT GOOD WORLD BUILDING
[3:30:41] <%Nekros4442> WElcome to Mass Effect 4
[3:30:41] <CorruptDropbear> Basically "Oh wait they also have nukes"
[3:30:43] <%AncelDeLambert> the Turians would have been INCREDIBLY stupid in this situation, because it would have been clear that it wasn't military vessels at the relay
[3:30:50] <+TheEvilOmega> My favorite codex bits in ME1 are the ones about ship battles and weapons.
[3:30:52] <+aslfrasle> @PatStaresAt Salarian Military Tactics: "Oops , all War Crimes!"
[3:30:52] <%Nekros4442> This is Mass Effect 4
[3:30:53] <+spartanghost004> Ah yes the super birds vs intelligent monke
[3:30:56] <%Torus1025> Earth almost got glassed
[3:30:58] <%bugz_munny> KILL IT
[3:30:58] <Mechazoic_Era> TERRIBLE it was
[3:30:58] <+Philoceraptors> god the council are a bunch of idiots
[3:30:58] <hippofant> ACAB
[3:30:59] <%sporeian94> They don't want another rachni situation
[3:30:59] <tranquilturnip> they love waaar
[3:31:02] <+DoctorDerp388> turians shoot first
[3:31:03] <akitanito> and they are on the council
[3:31:03] <aiutare47> Their entire race is extreme
[3:31:04] <wasdsf> they woke up and chose violence
[3:31:05] <%bassoontyphoon> USAUSAUSA
[3:31:05] <xcompleasedad> They were REALLY shitty
[3:31:05] <%valriot> Isre-i mean, Turians
[3:31:05] <Goraka91> Obey these laws you don't know, or we'll fucking murder you
[3:31:05] <+Promessa_EX> pretty lucky there was a council
[3:31:07] <%aBlueWizard> they did it FOR HONOR
[3:31:07] <%NovaKnightmare> "IM IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE" *bang bang bang*
[3:31:07] <RickSaintRiot> that the Council had to intervene
[3:31:08] <+marino1x88> just like us
[3:31:11] <%za7az> Yikes
[3:31:12] <Bigyanno> The Turians are NOT smart
[3:31:12] <%MidnightBurst12> straight up war
[3:31:13] <%sporeian94> They literally would've blown earth up
[3:31:13] <%Mr_Pylon> Worse than the Mbari
[3:31:14] <Blank9> first contact: we killed them, then they killed us so we had our ENTIRE FORCE come out
[3:31:14] <MagmaRam> The Turians genuinely don't give a shit
[3:31:14] <Mattais88> You can't do that, BOOM
[3:31:15] <xcompleasedad> Humans did NOTHING wrong
[3:31:15] <%AncelDeLambert> THOSE SCIENCE VESSELS ARE PLAYING WITH THAT THING THAT ISN'T ON!
[3:31:16] <wasdsf> lmao
[3:31:17] <+Belasteris> depends what is on the other side of that Relay.
[3:31:17] <%kyh9> To be fair Humans were SUPER VIOLENT AND SCARY
[3:31:18] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It was like find a kid checking out a gun and the shooting him
[3:31:18] <+ghostfaceninja_> how very human....
[3:31:18] <Profmcstevie> "Hey that's space illegal" huh whu
[3:31:19] <+senfood> What the fuck is the "Prime Directive"
[3:31:19] <ralphfromdk> to be fair, we started throwing around nukes real fucking fast
[3:31:23] <BlueBiscuitGT> I hope the officer that did it was court martialed
[3:31:23] <%skeleklng> "TASER TASTER"
[3:31:25] <+Peacefrog7> kind of cardasian of you turians @PatStaresAt
[3:31:25] <Vakojin> TURIANS ARE SPACE AMERICANS
[3:31:25] <+Buzzkill983> It worked on the Krogan
[3:31:26] <Parapattern> COP RACE
[3:31:27] <+DrSmashy> Don't forget that activating mass relays is what cause the rachni war
[3:31:28] <+D00msDayDan> it's like a stellaris game
[3:31:28] <%walternatorz> that's not very jean-luc of them
[3:31:29] <%GarbageNirvana> THEY'RE COMIN' RIGHT FOR US
[3:31:30] <mr_saturday93> Woke up to violence!
[3:31:32] <+spartanghost004> oh military action will keep the galaxy safe from super bugs Pat
[3:31:32] <%allups> wake up to violence
[3:31:33] <%NovaKnightmare> KInda cool that Humans arent the aggressors in ME
[3:31:34] <%JoshManVGH> Setting the ground rules for the playground
[3:31:35] <CorruptDropbear> To be fair, We would have done the same thing
[3:31:35] <akitanito> worse than the "war-like" races
[3:31:38] <KaitlynnHere> Legit, I thought that the humans shot first
[3:31:38] <malion17> They're birds, birds always choose violence.
[3:31:39] <+D00msDayDan> the turians woke up to violence
[3:31:44] <tranquilturnip> it might have been for the best that the turians found us first, in a weird way
[3:31:45] <%Solid_Stro> Turians are a military culture
[3:31:49] <+Maldoree> Arent Turians just SPace Cops?
[3:31:49] <%QueequegTheater> ALL PIRATES
[3:31:49] <MagmaRam> THAT'S RIGHT
[3:31:50] <%Bt_Robot> BATARIANS are space Americans
[3:31:50] <Mattais88> Batarians
[3:31:50] <Bigyanno> Let's be honest here, none of the council races are actually good
[3:31:55] <akitanito> GLORY TO MANKIND?
[3:31:57] <+AmericanSkidd> After ME2 "war with the Terminus" is such a joke
[3:31:57] <quigley_plays> All my homies HATE batarians.
[3:31:58] <jillpilled> Batarians have ACTUALLY NOTHING and it's hilarious
[3:31:58] <BlueBiscuitGT> Batarians, truly the "Space orcs" of ME
[3:32:01] <hippofant> @CorruptDropbear Jean-Luc Picard would NEVER PunOko
[3:32:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> Terminus systems sound like a cool place. Shame we will never visit that cool place ever.
[3:32:04] <+spartanghost004> the terminus systems the south of the galaxy
[3:32:05] <Deasmeister> Batarians
[3:32:09] <+Grizwaldus> Only good Batarian is a dead Batarian
[3:32:09] <aiutare47> Turians are just Starship Troopers, they kill whoever they want
[3:32:09] <Broken_Sonex> Some of them are cool at leats
[3:32:10] <RickSaintRiot> @Maldoree All Turians are Rich Evans, yes
[3:32:10] <%NovaKnightmare> SUFFER NOT THE XENO
[3:32:12] <%sporeian94> @Bt_Robot  Nah they're space al-queda
[3:32:14] <%aBlueWizard> BT? BT? gibes colonies plz
[3:32:15] <%kyh9> Terminus armor is based
[3:32:15] <SSPS87> just finished my first run, on ME2 now
[3:32:16] <Goraka91> Batarians are straight up North Korea
[3:32:18] <Daniel_Is_I> "They're all evil slavers, don't worry."
[3:32:20] <%aBlueWizard> i report you to concil
[3:32:21] <Vakojin> Vorchas are the fucking worst.
[3:32:23] <%Solid_Stro> Especially the Batarians sabert14Gun
[3:32:23] <+black_pariah> Its because their first sight of us was us opening a door to a potential rachni horde
[3:32:24] <ScreamLord> So the Terminus is Space Australia
[3:32:25] <%dekkitout> Outter Rim, got it
[3:32:27] <%walternatorz> Fucking Batarians
[3:32:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Batarians the somehow UGLIER space orks
[3:32:30] <+DrSmashy> SPACE MAGIC
[3:32:32] <%Nekros4442> DARK ENERGY
[3:32:33] <%NovaKnightmare> Being Spacist is fun
[3:32:33] <%Valdorick> "Humanity are bitches for trying to colonize where we won't. Fuck 'em" - the filthy coward Xenos
[3:32:35] <%Torus1025> Space Magic
[3:32:36] <+TheEvilOmega> Shoot every Batarian and Vorcha you see.
[3:32:37] <BlueBiscuitGT> SPACE WIZARDRY
[3:32:42] <%kyh9> Biotics = The Force
[3:32:43] <SaltyAzteca> SPACE MAGIC
[3:32:43] <ralphfromdk> Shepard goes, "don't worry, i'll fucking end these people all on my own"
[3:32:44] <ScreamLord> It's Science Force
[3:32:44] <%mike2hands> HE SAID THE THING
[3:32:44] <$Clarke1010> The force.
[3:32:45] <%NovaKnightmare> like whos gonna be mad, The aliens who arent here?
[3:32:45] <%Lizard0TM> @Mr_Taters  there's a subrace of Salarians called Lystheni that are SUPER evil
[3:32:46] <+Grizwaldus> Like a Force
[3:32:46] <+zajoestar> Magic
[3:32:46] <Mattais88> We really should. would get rid of all the cannabal in a few years
[3:32:46] <%sporeian94> IT'S SPACE MAGIC I AIN'T GOTTA EXPLAIN SHIT
[3:32:47] <Deasmeister> The batarians get it bad
[3:32:47] <%Raiden_Breaker> he said the name of the game
[3:32:48] <%kyh9> Legally Distinct The Force
[3:32:52] <+spartanghost004> Yes we made jedi with the power of cancer
[3:32:52] <Goraka91> I feel pretty bad for Vorcha, they only live to be 20 so never get old enough to get better
[3:32:52] <+GuilKato> space wizards are great
[3:32:54] <%MidnightBurst12> got it. space magic.
[3:32:57] <%kyh9> NotTheForce
[3:32:58] <+Davion_Salkovich> this voice has big "would you like to know more" energy
[3:32:58] <Bigyanno> It might cause the people's to unite sounds like a weak excuse made by people who profit from the terminus systems
[3:32:58] <Broken_Sonex> BLACK MAGIC
[3:32:58] <%JoshManVGH> It's like it... forces thing, to go other places.
[3:33:01] <%Solid_Stro> Space Magic
[3:33:02] <BinaryShuffle> Magic, got it
[3:33:04] <%Bt_Robot> To be fair, Bioware made sure there were no good Batarians in ME 1 and 2
[3:33:05] <awfully_crispy> it's some kind of force, it seems
[3:33:06] <%Raiden_Breaker> use some sort of mass effect 1 feild
[3:33:10] <%aBlueWizard> The only good batarian is a dead batarian.
[3:33:10] <%Solid_Stro> A force...
[3:33:20] <%PhantomMiG> Mass effect government thinks its the U.N but actions is pre-WW1
[3:33:20] <RickSaintRiot> Not sure how you can move things by lowering mass
[3:33:21] <Mattais88> LIke cancer
[3:33:23] <+Grizwaldus> Midichlorians
[3:33:24] <%kyh9> Mass Effect is basically Legally Distinct Star Wars/Star Trek
[3:33:27] <Bigyanno> Who wrote these entries in universe, cos they are VERY biased
[3:33:28] <%scaryboisupreme> MUTANTS
[3:33:28] <akitanito> 5G magic
[3:33:28] <%Andrizzleton> EZO
[3:33:29] <BlueBiscuitGT> I can't remember a single sympathetic Vorcha or Batarian characters in the series, help out chat
[3:33:31] <+Promessa_EX> super babies
[3:33:34] <%Varlinator> OOF
[3:33:35] <%NovaKnightmare> EXPOSE ALL BABIES TO ELEMENT ZERO
[3:33:35] <%bugz_munny> Kinda like the grey wardens
[3:33:36] <xcompleasedad> Kill your babies to get a super-soldier
[3:33:37] <%Ranryu692> biotics are pretty cool, even if their explanation is bullshit lol
[3:33:37] <RickSaintRiot> Maybe you lower the mass asymmetrically?
[3:33:38] <+Nephilim895> Nodules!
[3:33:38] <ape_hawk> SPACE MUTANT WIZARDS
[3:33:39] <yojohny> Feed the babies Element Zero
[3:33:41] <%MidnightBurst12> space magic comes from tumors
[3:33:44] <%Lizard0TM> I forget if the ME1 codex talks about the Lystheni, the super evil subrace of Salarians
[3:33:44] <AngryAsian5> That's fucked
[3:33:44] <lloyddboy> THE BIOTIC GOD
[3:33:45] <RaidenRising> oh boi, i love world building so much
[3:33:46] <+athuramn> this game was based on star wars you saythis game was based on star wars you say
[3:33:46] <%Deft_Thought> "You can gain psychic powers but it might cause SUPER CANCER"
[3:33:48] <Mr_Taters > @Lizard0TM huh totally forgot about that, or never ran into, is it in a codex entry somewhere?
[3:33:51] <%kyh9> Exposure to Space Radiation
[3:33:52] <+D00msDayDan> in-utero tumors just happened to give you superpowers
[3:33:53] <Vakojin> YOU BETTER HOPE YOU'RE NOT MK2 BIOTIC
[3:33:53] <moonmeh> your child could get cancer or become power
[3:33:54] <%sporeian94> JUST DUMP SOME SOME EEZO IN A RESIDENTAIL AREA
[3:33:55] <+falineth> yay science experiments on babies
[3:33:55] <%ComradeConquistador> Give the babies cancer for Space powers.
[3:33:56] <MagmaRam> @RickSaintRiot lower mass of object to move, raise mass of air in direction you want it to move so that it gets gravity'd over in that direction
[3:33:56] <+DrSmashy> Unless you're an asari
[3:34:00] <%Daxalog> Totally worth
[3:34:01] <+TheEvilOmega> There are no good Batarians or Vorcha. None.
[3:34:04] <Mr_Taters > @Lizard0TM Ah gotcha
[3:34:07] <SSPS87> element zero exposure?
[3:34:09] <%kyh9> SO MUCH DETAIL
[3:34:11] <+black_pariah> oops spilled some eezo on this orphange
[3:34:14] <dd44dostivei> voiced lore for armor
[3:34:14] <+D00msDayDan> haha oops this starship exploded over this populated area how unfortunate
[3:34:14] <Broken_Sonex> KROGAN EYEYE
[3:34:15] <%Torus1025> As ridiculous as Biotics are, they're still a 10000% better excuse for space magic than the Force
[3:34:16] <Mr_Taters > @Lizard0TM Thanks!
[3:34:18] <Mattais88> Blow up a refinery in a population centre and hope for the bsst- Cerebus, humanity first
[3:34:19] <%kyh9> "Here's how our space armor works, voiced"
[3:34:19] <CrypticMochi> Is every batarian an asshole except that one sick batarian who warms up to you after you help him?
[3:34:19] <dashmatt> ablative
[3:34:20] <%QueequegTheater> Bray is a cool Batarian
[3:34:20] <Goraka91> @BlueBiscuitGT There's Batarian refugees in 3, turns out their government was just complete assholes with secret police and propaganda
[3:34:20] <%Solid_Stro> Metachlorine
[3:34:20] <%dekkitout> No goo-crystal impact armor? Wack
[3:34:20] <%Lizard0TM> @Mr_Taters  either ME2 or 3, I know it aint talked about in 1
[3:34:21] <Deasmeister> Kaiden's backstory talks about it
[3:34:28] <+Nephilim895> the slow knife
[3:34:30] <%Deft_Thought> Too bad they stop caring about most of this shit from every game going forward
[3:34:31] <ralphfromdk> So you're saying we should go back to swords? LUL
[3:34:37] <Bigyanno> AN ONBOARD MINIFRIDGE
[3:34:40] <MagmaRam> What the fuck is a mini-frame, just say computer
[3:34:43] <%sporeian94> Literally iron man suits
[3:34:45] <%scaryboisupreme> Doesn't Cerberus actually dump a bunch of Ezo on an orphanage
[3:34:46] <RickSaintRiot> @RickSaintRiot I don't think you can raise the mass of air enough to use gravity as the moving force
[3:34:55] <%aBlueWizard> Shepard, killing those 2000 billion batarians to stop the reapers was a hard choice for you i'm sure.  Shepard - "Reapers?"
[3:34:55] <BlueBiscuitGT> @Goraka91 Oh yeah, was it in the refugee ward on the citadel?
[3:34:55] <%sunsetdisc0> for a second i thought it was going to say it had an onboard mini fridge
[3:34:56] <%TheHairiestHare> I also heard on board mini fridge
[3:34:56] <%MelBrooksKA> I really thought it was gonna say minifridge
[3:34:59] <+TheEvilOmega> Earth Biotics were made by a company "accidentally" dumping a ton of elements zero on a poor neighborhood.
[3:35:01] <Daniel_Is_I> The Space Force
[3:35:12] <%Valdorick> Space Magic
[3:35:19] <ScreamLord> Or even negative mass
[3:35:19] <reonome> ASS EFFECT
[3:35:20] <Goraka91> @BlueBiscuitGT Vaguely recall some sympathetic conversations in the background
[3:35:21] <%Deft_Thought> God, the mechanical shift to adding ammo into the game made it play better as a 3rd-person shooter but BOY was it a stupid narrative
[3:35:21] <CorruptDropbear> MASS EFFECT
[3:35:23] <%AncelDeLambert> it manipulates gravitational fields
[3:35:35] <+OG_M_Bison> Can mass effect make me thicc?
[3:35:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Every gun is a railgun
[3:35:36] <+D00msDayDan> it affects mass
[3:35:36] <+spartanghost004> We have managed to alter the mass of everything in the world fantastic it almost went horribly wrong when the space squids showed up
[3:35:38] <dd44dostivei> OOPS all neutrons!
[3:35:38] <%Deft_Thought> stupid narrative decisions*
[3:35:38] <+robosqueeb> kinda like itty bitty railguns
[3:35:39] <%AncelDeLambert> ~C
[3:35:41] <%scaryboisupreme> Basically rail guns
[3:35:43] <+Peacefrog7> thats why ammo in 1 is unlimited
[3:35:45] <%dekkitout> That sounds dangerous and should be highly regulated
[3:35:45] <wasdsf> its so cool
[3:35:46] <Goraka91> @BlueBiscuitGT Something like a batarian going ''wait, you guys AREN'T all assholes?''
[3:35:47] <TheMostAverageGamer4> woah
[3:35:49] <BlueBiscuitGT> @Goraka91 its coming back to me, thanks
[3:35:49] <+athuramn> I hope you're getting paid up the ass for this, because this is literally better than every other stream that got sponsored
[3:35:51] <%ComradeConquistador> No mass is no mas.
[3:35:51] <%za7az> THAT'S FUCKING COOL
[3:35:52] <%kyh9> Bullet projected at light speed
[3:35:53] <AmuserName> it's SO cool
[3:35:53] <+abatage> no mas
[3:35:53] <Daniel_Is_I> Imagine a rod from god, but a grain of sand
[3:35:55] <akitanito> imagine killing all those random people from stray shots
[3:36:00] <CrypticMochi> Shavings from a block and you can fire thousands of rounds
[3:36:01] <DatAsuna> Although that's basically just shooting flechettes which would probably disintegrate due to air friction
[3:36:01] <ralphfromdk> Naw man, tungsthen
[3:36:03] <Mattais88> whicj is why ammo never loses only overhaet the cpu
[3:36:08] <+D00msDayDan> actually the rounds fired move too fast to cause damage if the projectile isn't designed to fragment on impact
[3:36:09] <%Deft_Thought> And they change it so that you're ejecting heat sinks from your weapons
[3:36:14] <birdbones26> rad
[3:36:14] <TheMostAverageGamer4> thats intense
[3:36:14] <%Solid_Stro> Cool
[3:36:15] <%kyh9> I CANT BELIEVE THEY FUCKED UP THE LORE SO BAD LATER
[3:36:16] <butthurtdave> The ammo situation in 2 is so terrible
[3:36:20] <+OG_M_Bison> @athuramn This is a sponsored stream?
[3:36:24] <BinaryShuffle> They run out of ammo, but you only need to reload every few months iirc
[3:36:24] <%sporeian94> JUST DUMP SOME SHIT IN THE HARBOR!
[3:36:25] <Goraka91> Crimes!
[3:36:29] <ralphfromdk> So we give you space cancer LUL
[3:36:30] <jillpilled> The heat sink shift eject still makes no sense to me in 2
[3:36:32] <yojohny> Whoops
[3:36:34] <%Daxalog> Aww man
[3:36:37] <%Treuan> Oopsie
[3:36:37] <%kyh9> CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY FOR HUMANITY
[3:36:39] <%dekkitout> Terrogen bombs, got it
[3:36:39] <%MidnightBurst12> oops
[3:36:41] <ape_hawk> "accidentally"
[3:36:41] <+Peacefrog7> "accidentally"
[3:36:42] <+AmericanSkidd> Oops, all eezo
[3:36:42] <yojohny> Whoops all Element Zero
[3:36:43] <wasdsf> oopsy eugenics
[3:36:44] <Case_Ah_Dia> MASS EFFECT: the ultimate bio-weapon
[3:36:44] <+Buzzkill983> OOPS
[3:36:47] <%sporeian94> IT'S NOT A WAR CRIME IF THERE
[3:36:47] <+Data7lorE> Thanks Cerberus!!
[3:36:47] <%QueequegTheater> Is it ever confirmed that it's not accidental?
[3:36:47] <DatAsuna> And that's how Kaidan happens
[3:36:48] <MagmaRam> Oh, whoopsie daisy, oops!
[3:36:50] <jillpilled> woopsy did a war crime
[3:36:51] <%kyh9> OOPS, HOPE YOU DONT GET CANCER
[3:36:51] <%sporeian94> IF THERE'S BENEFITS
[3:36:51] <AmuserName> Whoopsie doodles, now we got the soldiers!
[3:36:51] <Mattais88> I thought it was cereburus?
[3:36:53] <Lee_The_Limey> Ooopsy we made more super babies Kappa
[3:36:53] <SaltyAzteca> ''oops all chernobyl"
[3:36:53] <+OG_M_Bison> @jillpilled Because shooty shoot game need reload button :)
[3:36:53] <Daniel_Is_I> Sorry you all get cancer but we get a few supersoldiers out of it!
[3:36:54] <+Peacefrog7> Sadge Signapore
[3:36:54] <+SoySocks> and a bunch die lol
[3:36:55] <RushUnplugged> we made a fucky wucky with eezoo
[3:36:55] <tanarath> W H O O P S
[3:36:55] <%aBlueWizard> did they have a pride flag on the side of the ship when they did it?
[3:36:56] <KaitlynnHere> Ooooooh nooooo!
[3:36:57] <+Buzzkill983> IF THEY DIE THEY DIE
[3:36:57] <dd44dostivei> oops all neutrons
[3:36:59] <Centaur_field> or get brain cancer
[3:36:59] <pth88> You can't prove that in a court of law @PatStaresAt
[3:37:00] <%ComradeConquistador> Oops all cancer
[3:37:01] <Goraka91> War crimes to create Jedi
[3:37:02] <butthurtdave> So Pat, Kaiden or Ashley?
[3:37:02] <Broken_Sonex> OOPS ALL EZZO
[3:37:02] <+spartanghost004> Cerberus you mean Cerberus
[3:37:03] <CorruptDropbear> we accidently made superman
[3:37:03] <%templar010> Oops all X-men
[3:37:04] <aiutare47> Humans absolutely were not meant to use Biotics, its just us not wanting to be left behind by races like the Asari. Biotic humans are 100% human hubris
[3:37:05] <KaitlynnHere> How can this be?! @patstaresat
[3:37:05] <%scaryboisupreme> It is Cerberus that does that tho
[3:37:09] <%aBlueWizard> "Happy June"
[3:37:11] <%Mr_Pylon> and don't worry, they've got great military hospitals and free tuition to military school for the affected
[3:37:13] <%Alazull> "Whoops big assidents"
[3:37:14] <Deasmeister> Or get BIG cancer
[3:37:15] <Bigyanno> I know the exact spot that picture is from
[3:37:15] <%dekkitout> @templar010 More like Inhumans
[3:37:18] <+Peacefrog7> god i love the codex
[3:37:18] <BlueBiscuitGT> That feels like SEELE plans
[3:37:18] <%Solid_Stro> But make sure to get all the women super pregers first
[3:37:20] <%JohnAtDawn> I thought they only did that once?
[3:37:22] <stantheman_97> oopies accidental cancer but maybe your baby will be a super soldier
[3:37:24] <+Peacefrog7> can we romance the codex
[3:37:28] <+Grizwaldus> OOPs All EEZO
[3:37:37] <+D00msDayDan> i love how exhaustive the tech is
[3:37:39] <%sporeian94> Doctor Michel
[3:37:43] <+TheEvilOmega> Asari are only biotics because their home planet is basically a ball of eezo.
[3:37:44] <+black_pariah> frenchie
[3:37:46] <Bigyanno> Doctor french woman
[3:37:48] <RushUnplugged> 99% of people get super cancer, 1% get powers, WORTH IT amirite
[3:37:49] <jillpilled> @OG_M_Bison lol it's true. games increasingly went the third person shooter identity-route
[3:37:52] <%sporeian94> She wants to fuck Garrus
[3:37:57] <ScreamLord> MediGel is technically illegal
[3:38:00] <+spartanghost004> oh hey its the doctor that is into our main boi
[3:38:02] <%Deft_Thought> I still don't get how that makes sense. Children can develop outside of the womb with current tech. Why bother with an "oopsie!" when you can work to develop a Biotic under controlled circumstances?
[3:38:02] <%Lizard0TM> Man, why is Dr. Chawkwas so hot in the remaster
[3:38:03] <Goraka91> Bioplasm
[3:38:04] <%Bt_Robot> Quick start yelling about tech gel!
[3:38:05] <+senfood> Dr. Chakwas is my wife and we are married.
[3:38:05] <%AncelDeLambert> I love medi-gel, because it's basically "Oops, we committed a High Crime against the Council, but the Council had to admit how dope it is"
[3:38:07] <xcompleasedad> Human's greatest achievement
[3:38:08] <%Lizard0TM> like holy shit
[3:38:11] <+titansloth93> slap some Super Glue on that bullet wound
[3:38:14] <xcompleasedad> Humanity's
[3:38:16] <Mattais88> Dr. "Only see her if Chakwas dies in 2"
[3:38:16] <+AmericanSkidd> Technically illegal but way too useful
[3:38:16] <%TheMattman1313> So you can kill someone by plugging their airways
[3:38:17] <%Monkeyweed21> it also means that you can punch someone and shields cant stop you
[3:38:17] <Manjove> the easiest half hour of content ever made.
[3:38:17] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAT A STUPID LAW
[3:38:17] <%Rumbutt> oroLUL
[3:38:20] <+D00msDayDan> so did they steal biofoam from halo or bacta from star wars
[3:38:20] <%dekkitout> It what?
[3:38:20] <+Promessa_EX> stem cells lol
[3:38:20] <yojohny> Dr Choclates
[3:38:21] <BlueBiscuitGT> @TheEvilOmega Also Prothean genetic manipulation to make them more receptive to it iirc
[3:38:22] <tanarath> TECHNICALLY
[3:38:24] <tranquilturnip> space green herb
[3:38:24] <RickSaintRiot> I thought about increasing the mass of the air BEHIND the object, but afaik mass has no relation to pressure?
[3:38:25] <%maenos2> wait, sirta?  Like...Czerka?
[3:38:28] <%SirGO0SE> too good at saving lives
[3:38:29] <+Peacefrog7> LOL
[3:38:30] <%AncelDeLambert> they have laws against everything cool
[3:38:31] <+Belasteris> This is why Humans are more important. They invented immortality juice.
[3:38:33] <%sporeian94> Yeah but that was justifiable genocide
[3:38:34] <aiutare47> legit humans gift to the world
[3:38:34] <Goraka91> It's only illegal when you do it
[3:38:35] <Mattais88> but war, pat
[3:38:35] <+OG_M_Bison> What happens if I seal my ass with medigel?
[3:38:35] <tranquilturnip> there are no rules
[3:38:37] <tanarath> SHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[3:38:37] <AmuserName> BIG HYPOCRITES LUL
[3:38:38] <%Torus1025> Laws are fake man
[3:38:38] <MonsterGills> Are you going to use Michel for money grinding?
[3:38:38] <MagmaRam> How fast does something have to be moving to get fucked over by your shields, anyways? Is it like Dune, where you have to consciously slow melee attacks?
[3:38:41] <$Clarke1010> A grain of sand going at the speed of light hits like a bunch of TNT
[3:38:42] <%s1rcuit> @maenos2 I thought that too
[3:38:43] <butthurtdave> YEAH VANGUARD BOYS WE MAKE NOISE
[3:38:43] <%Solid_Stro> It’s too good
[3:38:43] <Broken_Sonex> Oh hey that French lady that wants to fuck Garrus
[3:38:44] <%GarbageNirvana> They probably put it into place right after taht happened
[3:38:44] <%Monkeyweed21> The Council are turbo hypocrites
[3:38:44] <%Ynkubus_> >.> Salarians...
[3:38:46] <%Varlinator> Too Good 2 Ban
[3:38:47] <+spartanghost004> Also the asari, turians, and salarians.
[3:38:48] <Bigyanno> I mean it says RIGHT THERE that they don't give a fuck about their own laws if it's convenient
[3:38:49] <%Emperor_Machinus> Oops all war crimes
[3:38:49] <+Peacefrog7> CITADEL TIME LETS GO
[3:38:54] <stantheman_97> too be fair krogan needed to be stopped
[3:38:56] <+Philoceraptors> the laws only apply to everybody else not the council
[3:38:57] <Parapattern> A Lil Genetic Engineering. As a treat.
[3:38:58] <%afronooch> regulation for thee but not for me
[3:38:59] <%Varlinator> ABS. Always Be Saving!
[3:38:59] <Rei_Dsoto> Just goes to show that Governments will turn a blind eye if the use of forbidden techniques benefits more than not using htem
[3:39:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Remember that there's no rules or laws in war.
[3:39:00] <%AncelDeLambert> Humans basically dropped the death rate in HALF nearly by accident, PUT US ON THE COUNCIL
[3:39:00] <Mattais88> shepards jog, alwsys makes me lauh
[3:39:00] <jillpilled> Laws, but only for the COUNCIL represented not the Krogan :)
[3:39:03] <ralphfromdk> I mean.. it's the HUMANS that don't like it... rest of the species are fucking fine with it
[3:39:03] <Lee_The_Limey> Salarians deciding laws on genetic modification LUL
[3:39:05] <ScrubTheNerd> Wait yeah, isn't that the Krogan's ENTIRE deal?
[3:39:06] <%Solid_Stro> Double Standard Fucks
[3:39:08] <Goraka91> PogChamp CORTANA
[3:39:09] <SaltyAzteca> Fuck all Salarians. Except that one. And the other one.
[3:39:12] <%aBlueWizard> WAIT! are you saying governments are hipocritical when it comes to things that benefit them and especially things that give lots of money to corps that bend the rules?
[3:39:13] <butthurtdave> Did Pat already answer the waifu question
[3:39:20] <%Bt_Robot> VI
[3:39:20] <RickSaintRiot> no world/galactic power ever really seriously cares about that kind of thing.
[3:39:22] <Bigyanno> I never talk to her anymore. I HATE her
[3:39:24] <%Lizard0TM> is Pat playing on pc?
[3:39:26] <+Peacefrog7> should i finish me 2 right now pat or watch you play me1 @PatStaresAt
[3:39:26] <%Bt_Robot> NOT AI
[3:39:27] <dd44dostivei> wouldn't a grain of sand at light speed just cause a nuclear explosion
[3:39:28] <+OG_M_Bison> @ralphfromdk Humans made it tho
[3:39:28] <+DoctorDerp388> yeah but can i bang it
[3:39:28] <Rei_Dsoto> @aBlueWizard But yes
[3:39:29] <%Nekros4442> ITS A VTUBER
[3:39:31] <trueGarnish> boomer api
[3:39:32] <Broken_Sonex> Asari Cortana Kreygasm
[3:39:35] <%Monkeyweed21> Did I miss Ashley being racist to the Elcor

[3:39:44] <AngryAsian5> "Fully interactive" Kreygasm

[3:39:51] <%kyh9> THIS GAME HAD SO MUCH LOVE PUT INTO IT
[3:39:52] <%Lizard0TM> any audio issues? When I played, the first lines of dialog would cut off annoyingly
[3:39:53] <%kyh9> HOLY SHIT
[3:39:55] <SaltyAzteca> Man I spent so much time with all this lore a decade ago LUL
[3:39:59] <+TrevSmith222> I hate the way ME1 armor looks.  They all look like wetsuits.
[3:40:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> has Pat crouched yet?
[3:40:04] <Manjove> @Monkeyweed21 to be fair, Humanity First
[3:40:06] <%s1rcuit> also the geth are responsible for the ban on artificial intelligence
[3:40:11] <Broken_Sonex> @GuilKato Yes because Pat is a man, not a lady
[3:40:14] <Mattais88> It's cool, but what if more than 1 tourist shows up at once to the busiest place in the galaxy?
[3:40:15] <+AmericanSkidd> This is Shepards first time here btw
[3:40:19] <+Grizwaldus> Oh no the Cops
[3:40:22] <+OG_M_Bison> @ReallyBigRocks Yes

[3:40:45] <Goraka91> @s1rcuit Technically it would be the Quarians for making them and then wiping themselves out trying to kill them
[3:40:47] <Manjove> LOOK AT ALL THIS FREE CONTENT.
[3:40:47] <%Rumbutt> I love that the tourism bot tells you if you want to known more you should just ask the head of the space cops
[3:40:49] <Zrams3y> holy shit
[3:40:49] <%sporeian94> OVER 2000 YEARS OF BEING A BITCH
[3:40:49] <aiutare47> before Jesus
[3:40:49] <%dekkitout> Oh...
[3:40:50] <Daniel_Is_I> Poor fucking Volus
[3:40:54] <tanarath> IMPORTANT ENOUGH
[3:40:55] <Focant> I wonder how your companions feel just standing there silently waiting for you to finish your tour they didn't sign up for.
[3:40:56] <%wibbwobbler> V.I. Not A.I
[3:40:56] <BlueBiscuitGT> VOLUS ARE SEETHING
[3:40:56] <%BigCoffee> 2000 years !?!?!?!?
[3:41:00] <%sporeian94> 19 YEARS AND ALMOST A COUNCIL MEMBER
[3:41:00] <Dunmarkh> @GuilKato would you prefer a balding bearded woman?
[3:41:04] <SaltyAzteca> SLID INTO THE EMBASSY
[3:41:08] <%mike2hands> 19teen??
[3:41:12] <butthurtdave> Well look at what we did to the Batarians
[3:41:14] <%Solid_Stro> The security on the Citadel have more holes then Swiss cheese
[3:41:17] <%s1rcuit> @Goraka91 but when asked people will usually say geth
[3:41:18] <trueGarnish> 19 years. Volusia were robbed
[3:41:19] <%NovaKnightmare> new species arent as cool as us
[3:41:19] <Goraka91> 100 years for a fuckimg embassy
[3:41:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @wibbwobbler whats V.I?
[3:41:20] <%aBlueWizard> HUMANITYl, FUCK YEAR.
[3:41:23] <karovus> 2000+ years without becoming a council member? no wonder that volus is pissed
[3:41:23] <RickSaintRiot> boo hoo, humans are cool deal
[3:41:27] <+flexin_apex> Give vorcha a chance!
[3:41:27] <%aBlueWizard> COMING AGAIN TO SAVE THE MOTHER FUCKING GALAXY YEAH
[3:41:29] <balthazar758> those damn humaaans
[3:41:30] <+spartanghost004> Somewhere out there some dude was like... ANDOROMEDA
[3:41:30] <%dekkitout> Because of the medicine goo?
[3:41:31] <aiutare47> @sporeian94 its like the USSR being part of the security council
[3:41:34] <%TheMattman1313> You mean too expansionist to ignore
[3:41:36] <Mattais88> Sue, but we fucked up the turians, so they kind of had too
[3:41:38] <+AmericanSkidd> Dumbass
[3:41:38] <Zrams3y> They were scared we were going to nuke the citadel for humanity
[3:41:39] <RickSaintRiot> Computer, what do you think about the state of my marriage
[3:41:40] <+Grizwaldus> HANAR LIVES MATTER
[3:41:40] <+eanscrale> Damn dirty apes
[3:41:41] <Virokwet> Maybe its cause teh Turians shot without talking frist?
[3:41:44] <+RyanTheRecluse> Humanity was just built different
[3:41:45] <spuginky> 2 BASED 4 SPACE
[3:41:45] <+athuramn> medi gel was a human decision
[3:41:45] <birdbones26> monkee too strong
[3:41:46] <radioamnesiac> can you imagine talking to someone, and they tell you "George, a canadian, is in charge"
[3:41:46] <+titansloth93> Programmed as a Centrist
[3:41:48] <Broken_Sonex> Humans are based says the council
[3:41:49] <CorruptDropbear> "They have space nukes"
[3:41:54] <RickSaintRiot> Computer, what's your opinion on rollback
[3:41:57] <ianabstract> "You successfully fought off our military enforcer species with homegrown tech, if we don't give you an embassy you might rock our shit"
[3:42:01] <butthurtdave> BOOO SUIT MONKEYS
[3:42:07] <Daniel_Is_I> So third most important species, still no Council seat.
[3:42:12] <%Bt_Robot> Humanity almost defeated the Turians first time they met, and Turians are the space navy species.
[3:42:12] <Lee_The_Limey> It's kinda weird that she's aware of her own coding
[3:42:13] <%Solid_Stro> Money Bags
[3:42:16] <RickSaintRiot> Computer, does this suit make me look fat
[3:42:18] <%dekkitout> They got it pretty fucking short end
[3:42:20] <MagmaRam> didn't humans also get an embassy for inventing medi-gel
[3:42:24] <jillpilled> Thanks for the non-answer Avina LUL
[3:42:27] <Goraka91> Responsibilities like a GALACTIC ECONOMY?
[3:42:33] <Broken_Sonex> @ianabstract This^
[3:42:33] <BlueBiscuitGT> I think it's in a way the Turian's fault that humanity was fast tracked. If first contact had been peaceful I don't know if mankind would have received the same treatment
[3:42:33] <aiutare47> ooof\
[3:42:36] <%sporeian94> VOLUS TOO SHIT TO FIGHT
[3:42:36] <CorruptDropbear> AKA "You must have nukes"
[3:42:37] <Goraka91> LESSER SPECIES
[3:42:37] <+AmericanSkidd> Shepard is talking to Clippy.EXE asking what it thinks, what a goober
[3:42:38] <%za7az> "lesser species"
[3:42:39] <Parapattern> Lesser SPecies
[3:42:40] <+athuramn> @ianabstract that's a good way to put that
[3:42:40] <Mattais88> LESSER
[3:42:40] <%sunsetdisc0> "lesser species"
[3:42:42] <%MidnightBurst12> "lesser"
[3:42:42] <BinaryShuffle> LESSER SPECIES!?
[3:42:45] <ape_hawk> "they have to give us MILITARY ADVANTAGES"
[3:42:45] <SaltyAzteca> PFF
[3:42:46] <%TheMattman1313> COUNCIL RACE BURDEN
[3:42:47] <yojohny> LESSER
[3:42:50] <trianglehat> I'm sorry you feel that way
[3:42:52] <Louie_Salmon> Man if all this detailed worldbuilding lead to where the series ended, I would be pissed too
[3:42:52] <BinaryShuffle> ADVANCED SPACISM
[3:42:53] <%aBlueWizard> they are only half the height.
[3:42:53] <+derrigible> "I'm sorry if I offended you"
[3:42:53] <tanarath> UNABLE TO MEET IT HUH
[3:42:54] <+DoctorDerp388> it was ashley
[3:42:55] <%za7az> HMMMM
[3:42:56] <%Rumbutt> SpRace War!
[3:42:58] <%aBlueWizard> manglet races btfo
[3:42:58] <+D00msDayDan> it would be "unfair" to recognize your importance
[3:43:00] <balthazar758> lesser huh
[3:43:01] <Goraka91> Justice for the Volus!
[3:43:01] <yojohny> COME BACK WHEN YOU'RE NOT LESSER
[3:43:02] <+JaseAdrift> Someone was super Spacist
[3:43:05] <+StoopKid241> Probably an Asari
[3:43:06] <ScreamLord> And it was likely an Asari programmer
[3:43:07] <AngryAsian5> So whoever has the biggest space dick gets a seat on the council
[3:43:08] <cumurasame> Hey, Pat, I started watching/reading Hajime No Ippo. I learned the Gym owned by the author is an hour away from where I live. ...Should I sign up?
[3:43:09] <SaltyAzteca> Its 4D Spacism LUL
[3:43:09] <TomFrancis_> they were spracist
[3:43:09] <%allups> programed by a racist bitch i guess
[3:43:13] <+Buzzkill983> Why not just ask Volus to give economic aid and not military aid?
[3:43:13] <butthurtdave> This uhh...this isn't a full LP is it?
[3:43:15] <RickSaintRiot> I do think this makes perfect sense, except for calling them "lesser"
[3:43:18] <jillpilled> Definitely an Asari or Turian lol
[3:43:19] <+DoctorDerp388> tell me about the INVINCIBLE DEATH COPS
[3:43:19] <+athuramn> it's a fucked up galaxy
[3:43:20] <%scaryboisupreme> Very likely an Asari
[3:43:23] <MagmaRam> INDIGNANT: ELCOR ARE NOT LESSER
[3:43:23] <%Emperor_Machinus> Are the Volus Pat's people as they are of the orb?
[3:43:23] <%kyh9> To be fair, the Reapers divide species along technological lines when choosing who to slurp up
[3:43:26] <%BigCoffee> @butthurtdave It probably is
[3:43:27] <RickSaintRiot> Nobody expects Andorra to shoulder the same burden of NATO membership
[3:43:27] <%dekkitout> How does Specter/SpTR translate?
[3:43:33] <Mattais88> OO Squid
[3:43:34] <Manjove> Fuck the LESSER RACES
[3:43:35] <Grandnatics> Specters are SPOOKS
[3:43:36] <CorruptDropbear> James Bond
[3:43:37] <+Nephilim895> volus just need to design some weapons of mass destruction. Then they'll be important enough.
[3:43:38] <%sunsetdisc0> tell me about the fascist super cops
[3:43:40] <ianabstract> @athuramn Yeah it's like, if an uncontacted tribe sank an american carrier group we'd probably want to give them a seat at the UN
[3:43:43] <%Solid_Stro> Asari look down on all the species they fuck
[3:43:50] <Goraka91> Fuck yeah your genocide was super cool
[3:44:00] <%kyh9> Win your spot by putting down super turtles
[3:44:02] <MagmaRam> @RickSaintRiot okay but andorra isn't responsible for building and maintaining the world's economy
[3:44:04] <%NovaKnightmare> the turtle men and their fat fucking nuts
[3:44:07] <%sporeian94> IT WAS JUSTIFIABLE GENOCIDE
[3:44:08] <Realimpact> so if you cause enough damage you join the council?
[3:44:09] <VirtuaRailith> Tall Pat Shepard weirds me out
[3:44:09] <+Buzzkill983> Bird people. Effective against turtle people
[3:44:12] <%kyh9> Okay, but the Krogans were REALLY fucking shit up
[3:44:13] <TheButtravage> Bet you one of those spacist Turian's programmed her to say that?  We call those kind Tiggers for short.
[3:44:18] <%scaryboisupreme> Well the Salarians made the genocide, the turians just shot the turtle men
[3:44:21] <Goraka91> Reminder that krogans have a QUAD
[3:44:24] <%Rumbutt> I really like the Avina at the Krogan statue
[3:44:25] <%kyh9> They get their spot for being space cops
[3:44:29] <yojohny> Robot was just following orders
[3:44:34] <%Solid_Stro> Turians have the strongest military might in the galaxy
[3:44:36] <balthazar758> blu

[3:44:46] <RickSaintRiot> @RickSaintRiot yeah that's exactly my point
[3:44:47] <Broken_Sonex> Blooba
[3:44:47] <Mattais88> Dignitary with a gun
[3:44:49] <+AmericanSkidd> You cant just ask someone why are you blue
[3:44:53] <Dfreddy8> So no Beeline???
[3:44:57] <yojohny> @PatStaresAt Shouldn't you have passe dher on your way in?
[3:45:05] <%BigCoffee> She so wants to get rid of you
[3:45:06] <MagmaRam> @Solid_Stro only because the Space Washington Naval Treaty forbids anyone who isn't on the council from having more than 1 dreadnought for every 5 turian ones
[3:45:07] <%AncelDeLambert> this part is BULLSHIT

[3:46:40] <%TheMattman1313> All would be forgiven if they made a game that's just Elcor hanging out.
[3:46:40] <%kyh9> DO YOU REMEMBER ANDROMEDA
[3:46:41] <%sunsetdisc0> idk about you but i dont want dragon age 4
[3:46:41] <%sporeian94> Mass Effect 5 pat
[3:46:43] <mak0t0yukii> Just EA shit ruined it
[3:46:44] <+spartanghost004> yeah bioware is dead long live Bioware
[3:46:45] <%Solid_Stro> Elcor Hamlet 2
[3:46:46] <balthazar758> a good game
[3:46:48] <%sporeian94> It's Mass Effect 5...
[3:46:49] <%Arsenic_8> they did 4. andromeda.
[3:46:51] <Dfreddy8> Also TAKE YOUR TIME BIOWARE
[3:46:52] <Goraka91> Imagine thinking there's gonna be a Mass Effect 4
[3:46:52] <yojohny> @PatStaresAt Did you see the codex where Elcor mounted big ass cannons on their back?
[3:46:53] <%spoiledbadger> yep
[3:46:53] <%wibbwobbler> Yea
[3:46:53] <%Reveresao> flash forward 500 yrs
[3:46:54] <+SoySocks> @SoySocks ah simple enough. thank you
[3:46:56] <blackjack8182> EA is not gonna let that happen
[3:46:57] <butthurtdave> Make Destroy canon
[3:46:58] <%Deft_Thought> The majority of this interesting world disappears as the series goes on though
[3:46:58] <KaitlynnHere> Suck butts?
[3:47:00] <mr_saturday93> We saw Liara so she's in the game
[3:47:01] <RickSaintRiot> Weapews
[3:47:01] <+D00msDayDan> it's always a good time when pat says "you know what they should do"
[3:47:02] <DatAsuna> @kyh9 I played 300 hours of it, mostly multiplayer lol
[3:47:03] <+Grizwaldus> C-SEC Crime Noir @PatStaresAt
[3:47:03] <%scaryboisupreme> they already show it's taking place soon after ME3
[3:47:04] <%kyh9> I want it to take place IMMEDIATELY after 3
[3:47:04] <%StrawberryPantsu> So like MEA?
[3:47:04] <wasdsf> It takes place right away Liara was in the trailer
[3:47:06] <%sporeian94> It's gonna be 300 years in the futrue because efveryone but liara will be dead
[3:47:06] <+SlagChambers> @PatStaresAt New one was confirmed in the works and it's in Andromeda
[3:47:08] <%dekkitout> What is the passage of time in space tho
[3:47:08] <+Buzzkill983> Only Liara and Wrex would be around to talk about that
[3:47:13] <Virokwet> They need to address teh RElays IMO for me to forgive em
[3:47:14] <TheMostAverageGamer4> icthink its goign to be right after me3
[3:47:15] <dd44dostivei> liara looks aged in thr trailer, so yeah
[3:47:16] <leinadtonu> like andromeda?
[3:47:16] <%Varlinator> I think they are doing that 2nd option
[3:47:16] <MagmaRam> Set a Mass Effect game BEFORE contact with humans. No humans in the game at all.
[3:47:16] <+GuilKato> Mass Effect 4 - Romance the Krogans - to finally let you bang all the companion alien species from ME1 @PatStaresAt
[3:47:16] <AngryAsian5> Just retcon the ending like every other property with a shit ending does and move on
[3:47:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> what happened to beelining to Wrex?
[3:47:17] <bigfookinrat> liara is still alive
[3:47:17] <Dragovus> That's basically what they did with Andromeda
[3:47:18] <trueGarnish> WEAPONIZE THE ELCOR
[3:47:19] <%SABiscotti> DING
[3:47:19] <+vaderxyz1970> What could be a bigger threat than the Reapers?
[3:47:21] <+D00msDayDan> so it should open with buzz aldrin telling that kid about The Shepherd?
[3:47:26] <Mattais88> I want to see Shadow Broker Species walking around
[3:47:30] <buhbuhboat> if its after me3 they'd need to make one of the endings canon
[3:47:30] <%scaryboisupreme> I won't accept a ME game in the Milky Way without Garrus
[3:47:31] <%sunsetdisc0> i hadnt heard anything about a new mass effect what the hell yall talking about
[3:47:32] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt if 4 retcons the ending of 3 so that the fan theory was true, would that fix ME3?
[3:47:33] <birdbones26> how long do asari live though?
[3:47:33] <butthurtdave> Oh god, I just remembered: The Armstrong System quest for Tali.  IT TAKES FOREVER.
[3:47:34] <BlueBiscuitGT> Oh this side mission, i remember
[3:47:36] <%Varlinator> Go stop biotic nutters
[3:47:36] <ScreamLord> I want a spin off game where you play as one of the alien races before they developed FTL
[3:47:37] <malion17> Or, reapers are seen as a myth. And people refer to them with air-quotes.
[3:47:37] <TrollKing96> Before ME1, what was Shephard's experience with other races?
[3:47:38] <%kyh9> @DatAsuna Of Andromeda?  Impressive.  I didn't like the andromeda multiplayer as much as 3's
[3:47:39] <%walternatorz> I WILL DESTROY YOU
[3:47:41] <%Order_of_Mystery> mass effect 4: the geth are still alive. Forgiven.
[3:47:42] <$Futurecity10> Eh-Tah
[3:47:43] <Grandnatics> I love this conversation with the Executor with Wrex in the party
[3:47:44] <RushUnplugged> @wasdsf asari live 1000+ years, it could be at any time
[3:47:46] <%bread_assassin> I think it should be set in the future and tie in the plot points that ME3 originally had.
[3:47:46] <stantheman_97> it'd be interesting to have one take place during the rachni wars or krogan rebellion without humans
[3:47:46] <ianabstract> @wasdsf Asari live for thousands of years, so Liara doesn't mean it was right away
[3:47:46] <butthurtdave> LOOK AT HOW FUCKED UP KAIDEN'S HAIR IS LMAO
[3:47:46] <DatAsuna> Andromeda as a setting is still largely unexplored cause the scourge kept you in basically one nebula the whole time

[3:47:51] <AmuserName> CYAN-FACE

[3:47:55] <seniormeatbox> @Virokwet If you get a good enough galactic readiness in the ending, people are able to rebuild the relays
[3:47:55] <+D00msDayDan> hawking estimated time of arrival cluster
[3:48:04] <%dekkitout> Phrasing?
[3:48:05] <murdocismyhero> I want pie

[3:48:19] <DatAsuna> @kyh9 I compare it to base ME3 MP since MEA never got expansions. In that regard it's a big improvement, but given far less support over time.
[3:48:20] <+CookieCutter007> Best boi
[3:48:20] <+AmericanSkidd> Turians love human idioms its so charming

[3:48:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> that is next level pettiness
[3:48:29] <%sporeian94> DUDE THE TURIANS HAVE THIS SUDO WEIRD OBSESSION WITH HUMAN IDIOMS
[3:48:29] <ScrubTheNerd> What an asshole. I love him
[3:48:29] <Daniel_Is_I> That's advanced pettiness

[3:48:30] <+vaderxyz1970> I respect that
[3:48:32] <%TheMattman1313> Gotta give him some credit
[3:48:33] <MagmaRam> Pallin took the time to read up on human idioms specifically so he could get them wrong to annoy humans and I am here for it
[3:48:33] <aiutare47> Turians still see them as bratty kids
[3:48:35] <%Varlinator> Pallin is MR.C-SEC
[3:48:35] <Profmcstevie> I read a book about taking the piss JUST for this moment

[3:49:01] <+Calek> Pallin is so cool

[4:01:18] <HeroToxiko> Shit like that is why i wanted the mohawk bro instead of her racism
[4:01:18] <radioamnesiac> also, was the bug that the line was written at all??
[4:01:20] <%wibbwobbler> The Ashley bug
[4:01:21] <iosephe> The fact they'd even write and include that suggests otherwise

[4:01:30] <Grandnatics> UH OH
[4:01:36] <%strugglepunk2> like ashely feels like she's supposed to be a lot less racist than she is- and other people treat her that way.
[4:01:39] <Goraka91> I mean Ashley is an idiot but she's not human supremacist like Cerberus
[4:01:39] <%furiousfurioso> it doesn't even make sense if it was just for the keepers

[4:01:52] <+AmericanSkidd> They didnt bother to fix that bug now did they?
[4:01:55] <+spartanghost004> let's be honest after all is said and done no one saved Ashely for her personality

[4:05:02] <%Varlinator> God, Kaiden's Lego Head is so awful LUL
[4:05:05] <Mattais88> This screen takes me back

[4:05:05] <Rei_Dsoto> @PatStaresAt My Grandpa's dog Odie did the same thing with the Dog in Fable 2.  Was adorable

[4:05:28] <%W1nterTitan> I thought this was a paragon run?
[4:05:29] <+dilltacular> @PatStaresAt Have you played the new Destiny 2 Season??
[4:05:31] <%Monkeyweed21> Max out Vanguard or unlock shotguns
[4:05:31] <Grandnatics> Pistol Marksman lets you turn your pistol into a machinegun
[4:05:32] <dd44dostivei> marksman is nerfed
[4:05:33] <%Sweetangy021> Shoty
[4:05:34] <+Troispoint> Adrenaline Burst gotta be even better now
[4:05:36] <ghoostyberry> pat ti amo cazzo e odio il tuo culo da rana
[4:05:38] <Wolfstriker121> yes
[4:05:39] <+AFellowDegen> no

[4:05:46] <Goraka91> @dd44dostivei Boo
[4:05:46] <+StoopKid241> yeah
[4:05:47] <Virokwet> sure why not
[4:05:47] <Jmann1892> yes
[4:05:48] <ralphfromdk> Yes, you want shotgun. They are almost useless without points
[4:05:51] <Wolfstriker121> you wanna be close combat pat rambo space man
[4:05:54] <%Sweetangy021> What does the vanguard tree give again?
[4:05:55] <Grandnatics> Biotics are really, really good on Normal
[4:05:56] <dd44dostivei> @Grandnatics not anymore
[4:06:07] <ape_hawk> its so bizarre you have to put points into pistols to make shotguns even available
[4:06:09] <+DrSmashy> full auto pistol though
[4:06:10] <+ScottishMadJacko> oh god birds are tweeting, I've stayed up way too late
[4:06:10] <%AncelDeLambert> that kinda shit is why I use trainers
[4:06:12] <+athuramn> @marylandjutsu ty! I'm gonna start going down the mass effect iceberg lol
[4:06:14] <BlueBiscuitGT> YEYEYE CARNAGE
[4:06:14] <%sporeian94> SHOTGUN ROCKETS
[4:06:16] <Wolfstriker121> they fix the shotguns in me legendary?
[4:06:17] <TourettesPlays> Marksman ability is so much worse its so bad
[4:06:17] <Dunmarkh> @Sweetangy021 shotgun pistol damage and defense?
[4:06:19] <%Sweetangy021> Pistols are busted
[4:06:20] <BinaryShuffle> S L U G
[4:06:21] <MarylandJutsu> I prefer Sentinels myself
[4:06:23] <%newtmcgoot> oh pat is early in the game
[4:06:23] <ralphfromdk> That's ME2 Pat... it's pretty generic in ME1
[4:06:24] <DatAsuna> carnage do the big damage
[4:06:24] <%dekkitout> I memba Carnage- what a 90's character
[4:06:25] <%Bt_Robot> Carnage turns your shotgun into a Rocket Launcher
[4:06:26] <radioamnesiac> @ghostofsolomon the word won't come up, don't worry about it.
[4:06:27] <stormhawk9891> Pistols were always good tho
[4:06:28] <%AncelDeLambert> I totally forgot: I was out doing chores, what class did Pat choose? My eyes suck
[4:06:28] <%MidnightBurst12> oof
[4:06:29] <RushUnplugged> Vanguard supremacy
[4:06:29] <%Ranryu692> I hate it when that happens
[4:06:29] <Archmortal> WHAT IF MY SHOTGUN JUST FIRES A ROCKET
[4:06:31] <+flexin_apex> Lift and throw combo is always a joy when max
[4:06:32] <ItIsSky> I remember when I did my first playthrough using only pistol weapons
[4:06:35] <CrypticMochi> Pistol with master marksman has the highest dps
[4:06:37] <Goraka91> YEP
[4:06:38] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat did you do the Scan the Keepers quest yet?
[4:06:41] <Wolfstriker121> OH GOD YES
[4:06:41] <%bugz_munny> REALLY BAD
[4:06:41] <+ryuguitarfreak> Pistols usei tô kick ass
[4:06:44] <BlueBiscuitGT> Yeah its 5 am here, gotta go
[4:06:45] <+ScottishMadJacko> I only meant to watch an hour or 2 before bed
[4:06:46] <Dfreddy8> So much for Beeline
[4:06:46] <%sporeian94> There was bug that had Garrus' face was always low quality
[4:06:46] <jillpilled> YEP
[4:06:46] <Wolfstriker121> 100% spot on bad
[4:06:47] <+Grizwaldus> It was awful
[4:06:48] <%W1nterTitan> It crashed on AMD cards CONSTANTLY
[4:06:48] <%bugz_munny> Wasnt it games for windows live?
[4:06:49] <MarylandJutsu> @athuramn oh yeah the elcor or cool, but they do walk in one of the games. they move VERY slowly
[4:06:49] <+athuramn> @anceldelambert Vanguard
[4:06:50] <Mattais88> Only played the ps3 version so no idea
[4:06:51] <%Treuan> Huh. I see
[4:06:52] <%barrakuta371> I do remember
[4:06:52] <TourettesPlays> it still is kind of bad lmao
[4:06:53] <birdbones26> sure was
[4:06:53] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man I ran into so much audio bug shit
[4:06:55] <+DrSmashy> and garrus' face was stuck at low res
[4:06:56] <+Grizwaldus> absolute dogshit
[4:06:56] <SaltyAzteca> It was a rough time LUL
[4:06:57] <%SirGO0SE> the original 360 version has been the best version for awhile
[4:06:58] <RushUnplugged> ME1 is almost unplayable because it's still SINGLE CORE
[4:07:02] <+coldsama> Biotic and Tech gameplay peaked in 3 I can't play anything else in 1 except gun kinda ruined the first game to me
[4:07:03] <Peter9OOO> The port was so bad my PC gamer friend borrowed my Xbox360 copy.
[4:07:04] <+Belasteris> Elevator Loading Screens...
[4:07:06] <BlueBiscuitGT> Have fun, gonna watch the VOD
[4:07:06] <+MrBaldachin> none of the PC mass effects had native controller support, bioware specifically avoided adding it
[4:07:07] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, so he's rush rush btoom man
[4:07:09] <TourettesPlays> Just wait til Virmire Pat, it's so buggy
[4:07:17] <%MisterRockett> Thank god I obtained it on PS3 and then just moved to PC for 2.
[4:07:22] <%newtmcgoot> oh noooo
[4:07:22] <+CookieCutter007> immersive
[4:07:23] <stormhawk9891> Turning my pistols into big slow handcannons was fun
[4:07:23] <%X2Eliah> This LE is a *really* good remaster; I haven't had any bugs or issues with these
[4:07:24] <zenorot> the difference between ME1 and ME2 is stagering
[4:07:27] <Basch71> the ps3 version running around the Citadel was like sub 30 fps, it was god awful
[4:07:29] <Lee_The_Limey> Mine OG pc copy ran like butt  back in the day, always found something wrong
[4:07:31] <%valriot> Even with some visual stuff people dont like, which is understandable, this version of the game IS A PLAYABLE VIDEOGAME
[4:07:32] <Aeroallways> did you ever get the shadow blob bug?
[4:07:33] <%Monkeyweed21> M+K hotbars let you keep track of biotics and cooldowns @PatStaresAt
[4:07:36] <Explodincatz> fun
[4:07:36] <%Varlinator> I remember that, yeah
[4:07:36] <%sporeian94> It's not till after the council
[4:07:37] <Realimpact> not yet
[4:07:39] <+spartanghost004> oh will you suddenly find the power of the specters
[4:07:40] <+AmericanSkidd> He's not here yet
[4:07:41] <%X2Eliah> And they took out all the utter nonsense shite of bioware social network / whatever
[4:07:41] <RickSaintRiot> help there's a dog on the Citadel
[4:07:41] <stormhawk9891> Not yet

[4:07:42] <Draco_Renegade> Its after the meeting i think
[4:07:42] <%newtmcgoot> i stopped playing two right before the final thing because I was so paranoid someone would die
[4:07:44] <+Grizwaldus> Later
[4:07:44] <+DrSmashy> after the meeting
[4:07:45] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Any pc game port of the ps3 and 360 generation was usually crap
[4:07:45] <AmuserName> Gotta meet the counsel before you get the BIG STUPID JELLYFISH
[4:07:47] <Realimpact> after the council
[4:07:47] <Mattais88> Evangical hanar

[4:09:24] <%aBlueWizard> Kasumi
[4:09:24] <kago_dev> tali
[4:09:28] <BinaryShuffle> SourPls
[4:09:31] <Lee_The_Limey> Tali is my fav
[4:09:32] <zenorot> Tali stole the engine design from the Normandy.
[4:09:39] <zenorot> Liara
[4:09:40] <+ScottishMadJacko> @tonberrylives future news will be pleased with this decision im sure
[4:09:50] <+ScottishMadJacko> future me*
[4:09:57] <Wolfstriker121> a question in chat was ME 1 insanity felt easy over time with the armor and mods you get ingame ?
[4:09:59] <RushUnplugged> Liara gets so much more content and attention than the others, I don't even care they were playing favorites, she's miles ahead
[4:10:12] <%afronooch> Kasumi being a minor part in ME3 hurt me the most
[4:10:20] <+flexin_apex> @rushunplugged Yup
[4:10:22] <RushUnplugged> also Tali is your little sister and all'y'all are incesty fuckos lol
[4:10:22] <tranquilturnip> I like seeing pat enjoy things
[4:10:32] <Rei_Dsoto> "Let's Go!"
[4:10:45] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, ME2's chance of every crewmatedying really messed up how much htey could integrate them into ME3
[4:10:50] <+alphonseisbest> @rushunplugged Yup
[4:10:51] <Manjove> i wish the rpg elements stayed how they were in ME1
[4:10:59] <%jillpilled> jillpilled subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[4:11:01] <+ScottishMadJacko> @wolfstriker121 the games difficulty is all early with a few exceptions
[4:11:01] <%GarbageNirvana> @RushUnplugged The fuck are you on about
[4:11:04] <Manjove> i really dont like ME2&3 gameplay
[4:11:05] <%bugz_munny> Watch out for dalmations yall
[4:11:08] <+athuramn> "Nii... nii-chan?" @rushunplugged
[4:11:15] <zenorot> Jack is also my favorite
[4:11:21] <+fetrigon> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp jiyuTurnt jiyuTurnt jiyuTurnt
[4:11:25] <murdocismyhero> catJam
[4:11:25] <%X2Eliah> @Manjove blasphemy... ME3 plays really well
[4:11:27] <%bugz_munny> dont be near any cliffs around dalmations
[4:11:30] <Mattais88> Jack for life
[4:11:37] <DensityD> Jacking it is my Favorite
[4:11:46] <+ScottishMadJacko> God ME3 multilayer tho
[4:11:52] <%dekkitout> @bugz_munny Is THAT what people were on about?
[4:11:56] <Rei_Dsoto> LUL  Grunt is best boye
[4:11:59] <Manjove> @Manjove i mean that in the RPG elements and dialogs
[4:12:03] <Mattais88> That multiplayer was soooo good
[4:12:08] <Mr_Taters > Man, I hope Me3's multiplayer comes back at some point
[4:12:11] <%kid_flashionable> I'm so happy pat decided to play ME on a Friday so I can stay up just watching what I just played again, but with a lot more detail
[4:12:12] <%bugz_munny> Yeah the Cruella movie is bad
[4:12:15] <RushUnplugged> ME2-3 play well but I'm sad they moved away from a more RPG system to a more shooty style
[4:12:15] <%maenos2> is the audio being kinda weird for anyone else
[4:12:15] <%strugglepunk2> God i really hate how feel has introduced imouto tali brain poison
[4:12:16] <%bugz_munny> like really bad
[4:12:18] <%maenos2> fading in and outa bit
[4:12:18] <Bail_Seven> @ScottishMadJacko i spent way more time is should be proud of in ME3 multuiplayer
[4:12:22] <Manjove> @RushUnplugged she is literally a Lesser Race and not Chad Human
[4:12:24] <%strugglepunk2> Fuckin' jesus that dude
[4:12:24] <%kid_flashionable> case in point--I never realized what mass effect meant
[4:12:27] <%X2Eliah> ME3 MP was so fun.
[4:12:28] <+ScottishMadJacko> I hope this does well enough for them to bring back ME3's multiplayer
[4:12:32] <%scaryboisupreme> if legendary sells well enough they said they're bring it back
[4:12:43] <%X2Eliah> So what class did y'all main in ME3MP?
[4:12:47] <+ScottishMadJacko> Playing as all the different races and classes
[4:12:49] <%jillpilled> Why can't I pick Garrus AND Tali  with Fem-Shep. It's a crime
[4:13:01] <Manjove> @X2Eliah Geth Big Boy
[4:13:08] <+ScottishMadJacko> It was genuinely one of the best mps I've ever played
[4:13:12] <%bugz_munny> ME3 multiplayer had so many tech problems though
[4:13:15] <%strugglepunk2> incredible you cannot be a gay man who is into aliens
[4:13:15] <TourettesPlays> Samara is the fucking worst
[4:13:20] <+ScottishMadJacko> Krogan warlord was my shir
[4:13:25] <+ScottishMadJacko> shit
[4:13:29] <Mattais88> Why can't I pick Jack as Fem shep and get the best of both worlds
[4:13:31] <%X2Eliah> :)
[4:13:31] <%strugglepunk2> like actually nuts
[4:13:36] <%Order_of_Mystery> @jillpilled Tali supposedly has gay lines, and it is a crime against all things decent we never got it officially. ;-;

[4:20:13] <+evbites> Gief hates racism
[4:20:14] <%cvp5127> dogs hate evil
[4:20:14] <zanderwitch42> apparently people want to have sex with garus
[4:20:16] <DensityD> because video bames are art
[4:20:16] <+ScottishMadJacko> whenever garrus isn't around we should be asking where's garrus
[4:20:16] <Bail_Seven> are you going to read the codexs?
[4:20:17] <%bread_assassin> Racism detecting dog

[4:20:31] <%TheLemuroid> One step further than training your dog not to be racist
[4:20:33] <TonberryLives> FUCK THAT WOULD BE AMAZING
[4:20:34] <kago_dev> 4Head pit bulls would never shut up
[4:20:34] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat spend 6 minutes and do the Keeper scanning quest, it's big important
[4:20:35] <KaitlynnHere> Ashley should seriously go to a space therapist for her trauma and warped perspective
[4:20:36] <%LeiaSkynoober> There's a twitter account that's that
[4:20:37] <%MisterRockett> End of the cops, at least.
[4:20:38] <ape_hawk> is that because everyone has a little bit of racism in them
[4:20:38] <+Peacefrog7> its because gief is an alien and is offended
[4:20:39] <%dekkitout> I thought sex bots were worse case scenario
[4:20:40] <+fetrigon> because he's looking at you and then back at the screen. LUL LUL LUL

[4:21:32] <%jillpilled> The lighting's pretty kino here
[4:21:32] <Mattais88> KEITH DAVID
[4:21:33] <%GarbageNirvana> They don't need to hide everything under a film grain filter anymore
[4:21:33] <%Deft_Thought> KEITH DAVID
[4:21:33] <%walternatorz> I kinda liked it when you couldn't see 2 feet in front of you
[4:21:33] <illtima> I feel like this happens with all remasters. a bunch of nitpicks before the game comes out, then it comes out and everyone's like "Oh hey it does look good"
[4:21:36] <+AmericanSkidd> Time to get angry at the Council
[4:21:37] <KaitlynnHere> 20 years is a long time
[4:21:38] <%topendbuzza> topendbuzza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Can I get Mass effect like game where I can play as an alien, is that too much to ask for?
[4:21:41] <Parapattern> KEITH
[4:21:43] <%spoiledbadger> i hope it would considering the texture mods in the original
[4:21:43] <feralspidey> like a classic car that needed a tune up... and a WHOLE LOTTA CLEANING!

[4:23:03] <%blutzwavedave> SOME OF US EVEN REMEMBER IT
[4:23:04] <Archmortal> if you ask how he gets involved he straight up says the Council gave him, THE SUSPECT, all the files
[4:23:04] <Mattais88> He's not even denying it?
[4:23:04] <xcompleasedad> He didn't even deny it LUL
[4:23:04] <+D00msDayDan> i'm a halo fan of course i read the book
[4:23:06] <%X2Eliah> YEEE UDINA
[4:23:10] <ape_hawk> learn your place, lesser race!
[4:23:11] <%kyh9> @Goraka91 It would be the minimum of a remaster tbh
[4:23:21] <DensityD> the cole protocol
[4:23:25] <kago_dev> SeemsGood Yeah I hate humans. ANYWAY
[4:23:28] <%bassoontyphoon> ♪ Spectres ♪
[4:23:28] <%NovaKnightmare> no its ok to be racist towards humans
[4:23:31] <+evbites> the council sucks
[4:23:32] <+OmegaWeltall> him and Ashley need to talk Kappa
[4:23:33] <%Ravioli_Ronin> I hate Udina so much
[4:23:33] <%NovaKnightmare> dont you see the way theyre dressed
[4:23:35] <Kidbizzaro> Filthy squishy umies
[4:23:36] <%LouieRouie> What about the giant metal cuttlefish?
[4:23:38] <Basch71> ME1 leans on the racism pretty hard in comparison to 2
[4:23:39] <%strugglepunk2> God Udina's such a pathetic bitch right from go
[4:23:40] <+AmericanSkidd> WITNESS IS NOTHING
[4:23:40] <+DrSmashy> @DrSmashy thx
[4:23:42] <%sporeian94> It's because Saren is literally the greatest spectre of all time
[4:23:42] <DrStinkers> speciesist
[4:23:42] <%kyh9> It's not really racism when you have literally different biological organisms
[4:23:43] <HollowMan190> oh boy.....
[4:23:47] <KaitlynnHere> Why is he hologram so big?! It’s extremely inconvenient
[4:23:47] <mak0t0yukii> OPEN YOUR EYES HE HAS ROBOT SHT ON HIM
[4:23:47] <%Deft_Thought> The council is justified though.
[4:23:48] <%AzureGale> He's not wrong
[4:23:49] <ape_hawk> if ashley and saren were the same race, theyd be married
[4:23:50] <Mattais88> Like evidence of the reapers, You'll take that seriously right?
[4:23:52] <%sporeian94> He's like the Captain America of Spectres
[4:23:54] <+yoshkosh20> don't trust anderson. he's an evil newt
[4:23:56] <%Noir_Valdr> I mean let's be real here, they don't actually have evidence. Saren has a point here.
[4:23:58] <Archmortal> WE NEED EVIDENCE, ALSO WE GAVE THE REPORT OF THE EVIDENCE TO THE SUSPECT
[4:23:58] <+coolthulhuu> everyone is either stupid, evil, or pathetic
[4:23:58] <ralphfromdk> To be fair, the vision part is fucking dumb...
[4:24:00] <Grandnatics> Thanks Anderson
[4:24:00] <MagmaRam> Only facts and logic in MY kangaroo court
[4:24:01] <buhbuhboat> FACTS AND LOGIC

[4:24:05] <SaltyAzteca> Damn Pat you came back real fast
[4:24:12] <zenorot> Ashley did nothing wrong
[4:24:13] <+ScottishMadJacko> yup
[4:24:15] <Grandnatics> Yo check the map of the room after this meeting! It's good stuff
[4:24:15] <%Solid_Stro> @kyh9 Speciesism
[4:24:17] <%kyh9> How are you supposed to call someone racist when they say "I don't trust the group of space turtles who are disposed to being super hyper violent and nuked their own planet and tried to kill us all twice"
[4:24:17] <Goraka91> NO CONNECTION
[4:24:19] <+flexin_apex> Fair pt
[4:24:21] <Broken_Sonex> Yep.
[4:24:23] <kago_dev> BabyRage retrial
[4:24:25] <akitanito> look at how big evil he was
[4:24:26] <%Monkeyweed21> HE HAS ROBOT EYES
[4:24:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> Udina a sad
[4:24:30] <Mattais88> Oh wow, they ARE tubes all over his face
[4:24:31] <%blutzwavedave> JUMP
[4:24:32] <%JoshManVGH> God what an asshole
[4:24:33] <Goatllama> NAH RELATION
[4:24:36] <+Peacefrog7> @zenorot stop baiting KEKW
[4:24:38] <+OG_M_Bison> Udina is a cuck
[4:24:39] <%bassoontyphoon> is Saren's the only red hologram??
[4:24:40] <CrypticMochi> I mean you sound like crazy people here
[4:24:40] <+OmegaWeltall> Paaaatah! Spoilers!!!
[4:24:40] <+athuramn> Udine looks like the protagonist in that shot
[4:24:46] <%JoshManVGH> Asshole now, more asshole later!
[4:24:48] <%NovaKnightmare> the Council is so widely incompetent that the ME2 Council becoming mostly Human is almost a better result
[4:24:53] <Goraka91> Big leap Anderson
[4:24:54] <KaitlynnHere> @kyh9 it’s called a generalization
[4:24:54] <gaelic_otaku> I mean it kind of is
[4:24:54] <Mr_Taters > Man I wish some of the stuff with Udina played out different in 3 depending on the end of 1
[4:24:56] <BinaryShuffle> to exterminate EVERY race
[4:24:58] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Like are they not gonna airdrop the council a screencap of the GIANT FUCKING SPACE SQUID
[4:25:02] <+AmericanSkidd> Udina is a beta cuck confirmed
[4:25:05] <Goraka91> @NovaKnightmare Somehow, they're even worse
[4:25:08] <dd44dostivei> anderson kinda freaks out
[4:25:08] <Manjove> its amazing how little chat cares when you are racist to the right species.
[4:25:08] <%Deft_Thought> What the hell is that animation?
[4:25:12] <+Kaiserzelcor> Audio bug?
[4:25:17] <%Deft_Thought> He just started rolling his hands and walked away
[4:25:18] <%sporeian94> Also that's where Anderson meet his long time GF Kahlee Sanders
[4:25:21] <akitanito> it's bioware animation
[4:25:22] <Archmortal> @NovaKnightmare literally the only reason I always save the council is to fuck over Udina as much as possible
[4:25:23] <birdbones26> with bullets
[4:25:23] <DensityD> that duke meme. wow that's a lot of words, too bad I ain't reading them
[4:25:24] <%X2Eliah> What, no, udina is awesome and does absolutely nothing wrong
[4:25:26] <+OG_M_Bison> @NovaKnightmare The Council is in the right here. There's no evidence against Saren
[4:25:27] <SaltyAzteca> YEAH WHAT ABOUT GARRUS
[4:25:33] <BinaryShuffle> GARRUS PogChamp
[4:25:33] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp

[4:25:40] <%sporeian94> WHERE THE FUCK IS GARRUS
[4:25:40] <oligobear> expose his balls
[4:25:43] <%kyh9> @Solid_Stro Speciesism in a world where different species literally have different tendencies is less outlandish than people within the same species being prejudice towards each other
[4:25:45] <birdbones26> PogChamp
[4:25:45] <AngryAsian5> SCRITCH EM GOOD
[4:25:45] <Mattais88> Is the Citadel the only time you have a whole Human party?
[4:25:45] <%Solid_Stro> GARRUS!!!!
[4:25:46] <+DrSmashy> Find Garrus and insert him into your squad
[4:25:48] <+itsgundamu> I'm Garrus Vacarrian and this is my Rectum
[4:25:52] <%BigCoffee> And he will be your best friend
[4:25:52] <DianaTheAscian> Garrus the one everyone wants to fuck?

[4:25:59] <%Raiden_Breaker> hARKIN IS PATS DOUBLE
[4:26:00] <%Andrizzleton> this scene is effectively a VN with 3d models. it's actually really well done
[4:26:00] <+Buzzkill983> They are known as the... Big Three (Wrex, Garrus, Tali) enter the chat
[4:26:02] <%Paperware> Everytime Garrus isn't on screen we should all ask, "Where's Garrus?"
[4:26:02] <ralphfromdk> @PatStaresAt Who do you like to bang... i mean romance in ME?
[4:26:03] <+flexin_apex> Harkin pat twin
[4:26:05] <Parapattern> Please say more words Keith David
[4:26:05] <Archmortal> @OG_M_Bison he also is straight up given a report of what evidence does exist because the Council is fucking ridiculously incompetent
[4:26:16] <+coolthulhuu> hes sooo lame jeez i didnt remember
[4:26:17] <%Ranryu692> Keith David was one of the best parts of the last season of Community
[4:26:20] <%barrakuta371> Do WHAT to his mandibles?!
[4:26:21] <%kyh9> @KaitlynnHere Fair but the way the species in Mass Effect are written, Humans are specifically noted for how weirdly varied and distinct they are, implying most other alien species are actually pretty similar
[4:26:25] <Kidbizzaro> Udina leaves to take a shit
[4:26:27] <%X2Eliah> @ralphfromdk in 1st game the choice is *really* limitefd
[4:26:38] <SaltyAzteca> Shadow Broker was a fun time
[4:26:38] <+evbites> @Ranryu692 when is he not the best
[4:26:40] <%bugz_munny> T H E  S H A D O W B R O K E R
[4:26:41] <%X2Eliah> yeeeee
[4:26:44] <geosspone> who needs Harkin? All you need to do is get Wrex from C-Sec and the plot progresses itself KEKW
[4:26:48] <Mattais88> Yeah, shadow brokers been ther for a while
[4:26:48] <%SABiscotti> Harkin is a real creepo when you're FemShep
[4:26:48] <%Monkeyweed21> you will NEVER smooch Keith David
[4:26:49] <+OG_M_Bison> @Archmortal The defendant has a right to defend himself in a trial.
[4:26:53] <xcompleasedad> They set up everything early, EXCEPT T ACTUAL FUCKING ENDING
[4:26:59] <Broken_Sonex> Every time  Keith David speaks it's just Kreygasm
[4:26:59] <%NovaKnightmare> Saren did some CIA shit
[4:27:03] <Aeroallways> I like how they just have a straight up book summary here
[4:27:04] <ralphfromdk> @ralphfromdk yeah, but he has also played ME2 a ton, so that one could count too :p
[4:27:10] <geosspone> @Monkeyweed21 That's what Saint's Row is for
[4:27:10] <+AmericanSkidd> He did it for the lulz
[4:27:12] <%dekkitout> Oh hes Sinestro
[4:27:16] <+RealMichaelPhelps> hey guys its 2007, do you know about SPACE TERRORISTS?!
[4:27:17] <%NovaKnightmare> Ah the Stalin way
[4:27:19] <Mattais88> SO WOULD I
[4:27:19] <%Deft_Thought> Saren sounds American as hell
[4:27:20] <%sunsetdisc0> your eyes okay there keither
[4:27:23] <%WyvernOfMews> Almost like the ending we got wasn't the intended ending
[4:27:23] <Ids560> hmmmm shepard
[4:27:24] <+Buzzkill983> I think what makes humans crazy in Mass Effect universe is they are decent at everything, and sometimes exceed other races at the thing
[4:27:25] <Broken_Sonex> W A R C R I M E S
[4:27:29] <+athuramn> fun fact, you get the shadow broker dlc in me3 in the legendary edition immediately after the first chapter
[4:27:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @geosspone you cant kiss him there either
[4:27:29] <+robosqueeb> well a thousand dead to prevent like, a galactic war, doesnt sound so bad
[4:27:29] <%condemned_15> There’s a novel for that
[4:27:30] <%AzureGale> FORESHADOWING?
[4:27:32] <Dunmarkh> SO WOULD I
[4:27:32] <Archmortal> @OG_M_Bison they aren't supposed to be handed the prosecution's entire case against them
[4:27:34] <ralphfromdk> IF you kill ALL the civilians, there is not one left to wage war on you LUL
[4:27:35] <%topendbuzza> I mean it worked in ww2
[4:27:37] <zenorot> Was Anderson involved in the humans wars with the Turians?
[4:27:41] <stantheman_97> that's not really true, shepherd
[4:27:43] <+OG_M_Bison> I'm gonna say it. The council had the right to distrust you in ME2. You're literally working with human supremacists
[4:27:47] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Saren would kidnap a thousand children before he lets this company die
[4:27:51] <+Calek> and very handsome
[4:27:52] <CatRidder> keithhhh
[4:27:52] <Mattais88> IS the shaodw broker a cute blue girl?
[4:27:52] <%HairballCT> shadow borker
[4:27:54] <+OmegaWeltall> a Yahg
[4:27:56] <xcompleasedad> This one is, yeah
[4:27:59] <%X2Eliah> @robosqueeb Preventing a galactic war or perhaps a certain kind of .... arrival?
[4:27:59] <%Ranryu692> and doesn't at all have sweet tits
[4:28:01] <%Deft_Thought> "Some war crimes you can justify. But Saren? He just does war crimes, even if they're hard to cover up!" -Cpt. Anderson
[4:28:01] <critiquequartz> The game really shows you the end of renegade and paragon right up front huh
[4:28:01] <+MrBaldachin> anderson looks kind of off
[4:28:03] <Goraka91> I hear the Shadow Broker is ripped, I hear he has a six pack
[4:28:05] <Parapattern> I hope he's cooler than just a big monster
[4:28:09] <+evbites> @zenorot i think that was like a thousand years ago
[4:28:14] <Broken_Sonex> Y A H G
[4:28:15] <%scaryboisupreme> Shadow Broker is a goddamn centrist
[4:28:19] <%Bt_Robot> The Shadow Broker happens to be the best DLC in ME2
[4:28:22] <+ScottishMadJacko> love me3 content if you do me2s dlc
[4:28:23] <%Solid_Stro> Yahgs, banned species locked to their own planet c4sageLUL c4sageLUL
[4:28:26] <DSD24> Is Pat going Renegade btw?
[4:28:30] <+FelIian> Well our Councillor is a dick
[4:28:38] <+ScottishMadJacko> garrus and liara on surkesh lol
[4:28:40] <+OG_M_Bison> @Bt_Robot Yea cause you get to bank Liara
[4:28:45] <+OG_M_Bison> bang'
[4:28:46] <+flexin_apex> Yahg companion when?
[4:28:47] <Goraka91> I love how OP the Yahgs are
[4:28:50] <%sporeian94> WE WON'T JOIN THE EU CAUSE WE'RE TOO BADASS
[4:28:50] <%Bt_Robot> AndZaheed is some damn good DLC
[4:28:52] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Can you kill Udina in this one?
[4:28:53] <%X2Eliah> @DSD24 No, he said he wants to do a proper run to import into me3
[4:28:55] <+DrSmashy> @Bt_Robot Kasumi was fun for the first playthrough
[4:28:57] <%ElkRiverDog> Information brokers are actually HUGE risks
[4:29:02] <%kyh9> Zaeed is the BEST
[4:29:03] <dragon_ab> Days gone is over?
[4:29:05] <+Buzzkill983> @Deft_Thought Anderson: Saren doesn't just war crimes, he loves it! Seeks it out!
[4:29:07] <Parapattern> Everyone loves a hard worker. THEY DO ALL THE WORK
[4:29:09] <DSD24> @X2Eliah Thank you for the answer
[4:29:10] <+OG_M_Bison> Anderson seems a little SUS here
[4:29:10] <Goraka91> I forget, could you play a Yagh in ME3 multiplayer?
[4:29:15] <+FelIian> @Ravioli_Ronin that's way later, ME3?
[4:29:15] <%kyh9> I consider Zaeed to be actually the best addition to the cast of ME2
[4:29:19] <Slim_Lipid> is mass effect humanity just british
[4:29:22] <zenorot> Yeah in another century
[4:29:23] <%QueequegTheater> nope
[4:29:23] <%NovaKnightmare> CIA black ops, got it
[4:29:31] <%Deft_Thought> @Buzzkill983 He CRAVES war crimes!
[4:29:31] <MagmaRam> @kyh9 It's either him or Thane
[4:29:32] <%JoshManVGH> So... the plan is to stay being an isolationist and bitch about how they wont let us play?
[4:29:36] <%X2Eliah> @Goraka91 iirc no, unless they added in in the very last expansion poacks
[4:29:41] <+OG_M_Bison> @Goraka91 No
[4:29:43] <+FelIian> @Slim_Lipid you mean American?
[4:29:45] <%Monkeyweed21> man Anderson is the best
[4:29:45] <%sporeian94> PAt that plot twist is coming up in mere minutes
[4:29:48] <%jillpilled> No :)
[4:29:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's talked about in this game.
[4:29:52] <Javi9563> saren sabotaged him
[4:29:53] <%Ravioli_Ronin> @feliian oh I know, I just didn’t k is if you could do it early in 1; I know you can get the council killed for sure
[4:29:54] <Mattais88> Saren botched it and passed the buck
[4:29:55] <BinaryShuffle> They bring that up in ME2 I think
[4:29:56] <HollowMan190> Nope
[4:29:57] <srv4254> saren botched it
[4:29:57] <DianaTheAscian> what he do?
[4:29:57] <%NovaKnightmare> there's at least 2
[4:29:58] <+FelIian> I mean, that's in the game
[4:29:59] <Naho_Saenoki> That thing about Anderson is mentioned in-game, too.
[4:29:59] <%JoshManVGH> Saren botched it.
[4:29:59] <DSD24> Saren didn't help the botch job
[4:30:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's revealed in this game.
[4:30:01] <%QueequegTheater> Pat you spoiled it
[4:30:02] <Broken_Sonex> That's basically it
[4:30:02] <%sporeian94> Harkin literally tells you in 10 minutes
[4:30:02] <Goraka91> @X2Eliah Alas, probably thinking about the Collectors
[4:30:02] <+HefestoForges> why is anderson so surprised
[4:30:04] <+Davion_Salkovich> anderson and his crazy eyes
[4:30:05] <+evbites> nah saren blamed hm
[4:30:08] <%CalderGaming> they bring that up somewhere in the game
[4:30:11] <+ScottishMadJacko> you're literally one convo away from being told that lol
[4:30:12] <+AmericanSkidd> They are legal until they are not
[4:30:12] <HollowMan190> ignore  question
[4:30:16] <%JoshManVGH> They bring it up when you get the ship.
[4:30:18] <%Deft_Thought> I love how often the game justifies extra-judicial power as long as THE RIGHT PEOPLE are using it
[4:30:21] <+Buzzkill983> @Deft_Thought  Dreams of them even! I saw the journal of war crimes against humans myself.
[4:30:27] <ape_hawk> and then they just give it away to some rando squadmate in ME3
[4:30:28] <+OG_M_Bison> Anderson needs some contact lenses
[4:30:29] <%Deft_Thought> Good lord, this dialogue
[4:30:31] <%sporeian94> Classic Bioware "I'm special" syndrome
[4:30:32] <DatAsuna> ubermenchs only
[4:30:33] <+evbites> @Davion_Salkovich his ears are what wird me out
[4:30:35] <+HefestoForges> they saw your hair fall out
[4:30:37] <+OG_M_Bison> Perhaps he can get the same brand as Shepard?
[4:30:45] <Mattais88> They're not
[4:30:45] <%Spoonsire> Spoonsire subscribed with Prime. 
[4:30:47] <+FelIian> don't the Turians have a literal Spectre Training program?
[4:30:54] <ape_hawk> i think Anderson has to pee
[4:30:55] <pth88> Tell me about the Gray Wardens Anderson
[4:30:56] <%Spydurman> If 'Merica had Specters that could just do their jobs the terrorists would lose!
[4:30:56] <+Davion_Salkovich> @evbites oh GOD
[4:30:57] <zenorot> Spectre are given free reign to do anything
[4:30:58] <%jillpilled> They saw you get the main character juices from the beacon
[4:31:00] <%X2Eliah> @FelIian yep
[4:31:00] <%scaryboisupreme> no
[4:31:03] <+OG_M_Bison> @FelIian Probably
[4:31:06] <HollowMan190> wow they  sound like Jedi or something
[4:31:09] <+vaderxyz1970> What is that skin tone
[4:31:12] <+evbites> @Davion_Salkovich Look at hem
[4:31:13] <Javi9563> does this story have griffons on it?
[4:31:15] <%Deft_Thought> @Buzzkill983 Saren just drew a big heart around a flaming planet that had "Earth" written on it. It was in Space Crayon. Madness.
[4:31:16] <lloyddboy> man anderson hits different once Keith David did voiceover for the marines recruiting
[4:31:17] <+ScottishMadJacko> why wouldn't they save shephards hair if they've been watching him
[4:31:17] <+athuramn> so.... cerberus knowingly created a spectre or was that just luck on Sheppards end @patstaresat
[4:31:19] <%topendbuzza> sounds like a bad way of running things
[4:31:21] <tranquilturnip> "it doesn't happen often" so its happened more than once before
[4:31:21] <MagmaRam> honestly I wish that the game showed us some spectres who were just... fuckups. Not even bad people, just ineffective because it turns out that one dude with a minimum of support is not actually an effective way to accomplish things
[4:31:21] <%kyh9> @MagmaRam Yeah.  I think they're both pretty good because they have a shit ton of experience in exactly the type of work that Shepard is doing.  That experience sort of gives both of them the ability to communicate insight in terms Shepard, the MC, can understand
[4:31:23] <%Solid_Stro> @feliian Yeah a literal “Notice Me Senpai” training
[4:31:26] <%bassoontyphoon> Like Saren.... allegedly
[4:31:32] <Mattais88> And whoever lives is correct
[4:31:33] <DatAsuna> a good guy with a gun you might say
[4:31:33] <+spartanghost004> The rangers of the wild west
[4:31:34] <%Deft_Thought> Only a GOOD COP can stop a BAD COP. IN SPAAAAACE
[4:31:35] <%za7az> Why not 3?
[4:31:50] <%allups> what just fell from the sky
[4:31:50] <BinaryShuffle> that sounds VERY illegal
[4:31:51] <Goraka91> @athuramn Entirely luck, everyone was meant to die because ''lol weapon test''
[4:31:51] <MagmaRam> Barla Von is not going to pay his taxes
[4:31:53] <%topendbuzza> cop on cop crimes
[4:31:53] <+AceNugget> but then you run the chance of the good specter getting double crossed by their partner
[4:31:53] <+OG_M_Bison> Barla Vaughn is actually pretty cool tbh
[4:31:53] <DatAsuna> spectres are dumb
[4:31:55] <%scaryboisupreme> @FelIian No, it's just cause Turians are a militaristic society and are generally more qualified
[4:31:56] <%kyh9> @MagmaRam They don't ask those types of people to be Spectres, apparently
[4:31:58] <+Kaiserzelcor> It kinda sucks that you don't get to be just a normal spectre doing spectre things
[4:31:58] <%dekkitout> That sounds illegal af, Andy
[4:32:01] <%bassoontyphoon> Lawful Evil?
[4:32:04] <Broken_Sonex> "it doesn't happen often"  So you're saying it's happened more than once?!
[4:32:08] <DatAsuna> tela vasir is still fun tho
[4:32:08] <%sporeian94> LOL THE FIRST HUMAN COP AND HE'S CORRUPT AS FUCK
[4:32:12] <+AmericanSkidd> Harkin is a bitch
[4:32:13] <+OG_M_Bison> #NotAllSpectres
[4:32:18] <+JaseAdrift> Its weird how much better pat's shepard looks to all the other characters
[4:32:22] <%kyh9> But yeah, ME2 cast is just a cut above ME1 in almost every way.  Zaeed is just fun as the guy who really knows his way around the Termnius systems a ton
[4:32:22] <Goraka91> GEE
[4:32:31] <%NovaKnightmare> Harkin sleeps nude in an oxygen tent to gain biotic powers!!
[4:32:33] <%X2Eliah> lol
[4:32:34] <ape_hawk> makes sense
[4:32:36] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[4:32:38] <trueGarnish> who could have guessed
[4:32:39] <+AceNugget> send a good cop to take care of a bad cop
[4:32:39] <%TheMattman1313> AWW YEAH LIVING UP TO THOSE EXPECTATIONS
[4:32:41] <%MisterRockett> Not surprising.
[4:32:41] <TonberryLives> OOF
[4:32:41] <itsneroart> incredible
[4:32:41] <%blutzwavedave> LUL
[4:32:43] <%sunsetdisc0> so harkin is basically just a cop
[4:32:43] <%Mr_Pylon> WHO could have predicted that
[4:32:44] <%X2Eliah> THATS WHY EVERYONE SAYS HUMANS ARE NOT READY
[4:32:45] <+LemonyLilly> a very accurate picture of humanity tbh
[4:32:45] <HeroToxiko> he got fired by the worst guys LUL
[4:32:46] <%DakotaMacDoodle> sounds about right
[4:32:47] <%bassoontyphoon> ASCAB
[4:32:47] <+ScottishMadJacko> accurate
[4:32:47] <+AmericanSkidd> THEY TRIES TO FIRE HIME WAY EARLIER
[4:32:48] <RayCSmooth> what a twist
[4:32:48] <+spartanghost004> Surprising no one
[4:32:48] <%HairballCT> LUL
[4:32:49] <%jillpilled> LUL
[4:32:52] <Lee_The_Limey> What a hero Kappa
[4:32:53] <+DrSmashy> LUL
[4:32:56] <%bassoontyphoon> All Space Cops are Bastards
[4:32:56] <%za7az> psaBig OOF
[4:32:57] <Archmortal> that's one of my favorite details in the entire game
[4:32:57] <+evbites> @PatStaresAt spectres are supposed to be corrupt
[4:32:59] <%sporeian94> Shepard isn't a drunk like Harkin
[4:33:00] <critiquequartz> Pat is this your first play through?
[4:33:01] <%BigCoffee> he's not wrogn!
[4:33:01] <trueGarnish> right in the alien dick
[4:33:03] <+OG_M_Bison> @kyh9 Yea but Miranda is a bitch and Jacob is a cuck. Human squadies always suck except for Jack
[4:33:03] <iosephe> One lawless officer keeps another in the sheathe
[4:33:05] <%TheMattman1313> I Should Go
[4:33:05] <%X2Eliah> SIDEQUEST TIME
[4:33:05] <%Solid_Stro> Poetic
[4:33:06] <Mattais88> Harkin becoems your citadel BFF in 2
[4:33:07] <DraxTD> thanks Kieth!
[4:33:07] <ape_hawk> YOU DONT HAVE TO WEAR A MASK IF YOU BECOME A SPECTRE, SHEPARD
[4:33:13] <Detrius25> LUL FCK'EM
[4:33:15] <Broken_Sonex> ALL CEE SEC COPS ARE -
[4:33:17] <%Spydurman> laws are how the terrorists win
[4:33:17] <%topendbuzza> guess being a ground cop or a space cop your still a cop
[4:33:19] <%maximrx78> Imgine being a scumbag on a galactic level
[4:33:20] <DraxTD> Kieth David is the BEST
[4:33:23] <%sunsetdisc0> just pro-police state
[4:33:23] <%dekkitout> Could you imagine if Hal Jordan was a dirty lantern
[4:33:23] <%X2Eliah> Yeah
[4:33:24] <Mattais88> and 2 is space rogue cop
[4:33:26] <%BigCoffee> This is why DocSquidy hates some of it?
[4:33:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Space Magic Jedi Cop
[4:33:26] <critiquequartz> No it’s great!
[4:33:26] <zenorot> ME1 is an actual rpg with a story ME2 is a bunch of recruitment missions
[4:33:28] <+athuramn> @goraka91 ahh, ty
[4:33:31] <%Deft_Thought> Laws are for cowards! Spectres take justice into their OWN HANDS like BIG HEROES. A little eugenics every now and again doesn't hurt... us
[4:33:32] <%NovaKnightmare> Pat be like NOT ALL SPACE COPS! IM GOOD!!
[4:33:35] <DSD24> Its a sick area
[4:33:38] <%X2Eliah> Omg pat spoilz
[4:33:39] <%Taisuru> "Fill im full of holes, then fill those holes with bullets"
[4:33:42] <ralphfromdk> At least in Dragon Age the Grey Wardens are the underdogs fighting to save the world that doesn't want their help
[4:33:44] <%Solid_Stro> Kill’em all Shepard
[4:33:46] <%sporeian94> FUCKING CHORBAN
[4:33:47] <Javi9563> defund the space police
[4:33:47] <%BigCoffee> Wait how many people live on the citadel!?
[4:33:47] <%X2Eliah> yeeee chorban
[4:33:50] <DSD24> I see a Keeper!
[4:33:53] <%topendbuzza> #notallspacecops
[4:33:55] <+ScottishMadJacko> tbf, I never noticed it was an arena till the end
[4:33:56] <+OG_M_Bison> @zenorot The best part of ME2 is the characters for sure. The story is very MEH
[4:33:57] <DSD24> Keeper's are cute
[4:33:58] <Detrius25> Rogue runs are fuuny.
[4:34:01] <%RetroCop87> ???
[4:34:01] <%condemned_15> Kappa
[4:34:01] <%NovaKnightmare> See if Pat really wanted to make a space difference, he'd resign and do space crimes without council support
[4:34:01] <+Calek> @BigCoffee millions
[4:34:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> the only good space cop are the ones who quit. that's why Garrus is great!
[4:34:05] <feralspidey> SpaceCops? More like PoliceNauts, amiright?! :D
[4:34:06] <%sunsetdisc0> chorban? the overrated yogurt brand?
[4:34:10] <+flexin_apex> Omg spoiler Kappa
[4:34:10] <%X2Eliah> I love that delay before he says "uhhh. yes?"
[4:34:12] <ape_hawk> if you were a war criminal?
[4:34:13] <+Calek> 40
[4:34:14] <%Solid_Stro> My Shepard is an asshole that the galaxy deserves sabert14Gun
[4:34:14] <+spartanghost004> yeah this is super cop simulator its why rpg fans join the force and call of duty player join the military
[4:34:15] <+Sp3ctre48> ME2 barely has a story tbh
[4:34:16] <%Taisuru> YOU'RE NOT?
[4:34:17] <%sporeian94> 30
[4:34:17] <+DrSmashy> 40

[4:34:21] <%QueequegTheater> So you are a salarian
[4:34:22] <%Deft_Thought> You mean like you are right now?
[4:34:23] <+ScottishMadJacko> 40
[4:34:24] <+athuramn> like 4p
[4:34:24] <+spartanghost004> they die at 40
[4:34:24] <Mattais88> Because you'd only live 30 years?
[4:34:25] <%sporeian94> Salarians literally die at 30
[4:34:26] <%dekkitout> Very ol- what?
[4:34:27] <%jillpilled> Hey I'd like to die at 40 honestly
[4:34:27] <%bassoontyphoon> 45
[4:34:27] <%BigCoffee> @Calek and how big is the citadel?
[4:34:27] <+PenmanLupine> oh they live in bug years?
[4:34:30] <%Solid_Stro> 30ish
[4:34:31] <Broken_Sonex> 40
[4:34:31] <TonberryLives> Yeesh
[4:34:32] <%topendbuzza> you'd be dead pat
[4:34:32] <+Sp3ctre48> They live until their 40s
[4:34:32] <+evbites> oh shit
[4:34:33] <ianabstract> Wasting your time would be punishable by death
[4:34:35] <Mattais88> But you'd never sleep, so trade offs
[4:34:35] <DianaTheAscian> fuck that
[4:34:36] <srv4254> wtf really
[4:34:40] <dd44dostivei> turians only live to 80
[4:34:40] <%sporeian94> Asari and Krogan live to be 1000
[4:34:43] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Did Ashley say she can’t tell the aliens apart from the animals yet? woolieFABRICATION
[4:34:46] <+CasualDrunk> SCAN THE KEEPERS!
[4:34:50] <xcompleasedad> Man, no wonder they commit so many warcrimes
[4:34:51] <%X2Eliah> Asari are 2000, humans 150, turians/krogans...?
[4:34:51] <+OmegaWeltall> ya Salarians are very short lived
[4:34:51] <%JoshManVGH> Salarian metabolisim is nuts
[4:34:51] <%sporeian94> Humans and Turians and others live to be about 100
[4:34:52] <+FelIian> Asari 1000 years
[4:34:52] <%NovaKnightmare> the Asari are fucking Space Elfs
[4:34:52] <Pyrrhus90> get fucked LUL
[4:34:53] <Goraka91> Krogan live even longer!
[4:34:53] <%BigCoffee> Krogans also live for 2-3-4k years
[4:34:53] <Lee_The_Limey> Gotta get them war crimes in while they still alive Kappa
[4:34:54] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> psaBig psaWrong
[4:34:55] <%NovaKnightmare> so they suck
[4:34:55] <%sunsetdisc0> @Ravioli_Ronin several times
[4:34:55] <gaelic_otaku> And you probably hit adulthood pretty quickly
[4:34:57] <+OG_M_Bison> How long do Turians live? 100?
[4:34:57] <+Calek> @BigCoffee bigger than a breadbox
[4:34:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> and krogan. don't forget the krogan live for thousands of years too
[4:34:58] <Kidbizzaro> Basically the Tau
[4:34:58] <critiquequartz> Morden is roughly the same age as Shepard
[4:35:01] <%s1rcuit> @Ravioli_Ronin yes twice
[4:35:06] <DSD24> Keepers are cute
[4:35:06] <+DrSmashy> salarians don't have time to be pissed
[4:35:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Perpetually pissed Solarian is a character type they somehow managed to avoid
[4:35:08] <+AmericanSkidd> Salarians lay eggs ffs
[4:35:08] <ape_hawk> fuck you ashley
[4:35:09] <feralspidey> WHA- oh, you meant human lifespans in Mass Effect
[4:35:13] <Broken_Sonex> ALSO KROGAN
[4:35:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> ASHLEY IS SUCH A MICROAGRESSOR!
[4:35:16] <BinaryShuffle> Hurry and get Garrus, I can't take the audacity of this bitch
[4:35:16] <trueGarnish> relax, im a good cop
[4:35:19] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Salarians in ME1 probably have shorter lifespans than human dogs
[4:35:20] <+CasualDrunk> SCAN THE KEEPERS
[4:35:22] <MagmaRam> "Don't worry bro I'm not a cop. Yet."
[4:35:23] <AthenaAegis> Asari = Elves pretty much
[4:35:23] <+spartanghost004> how long do the krogan live? do they just die of unnatural causes?
[4:35:23] <+Buzzkill983> That's an NPC side dialogue specifically about a Salarian dad trying to get something nice for his Asari daughter so she will remember him
[4:35:23] <%JoshManVGH> Oh my god PLEASE go to CSec and get ashely off the team!
[4:35:25] <%kyh9> @OG_M_Bison Yeah but Miranda and JAcob, for all their issues, are still more enjoyable than fucking Ashley and Kaiden
[4:35:25] <dd44dostivei> krogan live indefinitely
[4:35:26] <+FelIian> Shepard is 29 in ME1 I think?
[4:35:29] <+Belasteris> Asari die just as easy as anyone else, even if they do have long lives
[4:35:32] <%kyh9> ACTUALLY
[4:35:33] <%bassoontyphoon> Ashley is permanently hovering over the [glass him] option with every alien
[4:35:34] <%kyh9> I DUNNO
[4:35:35] <+JaseAdrift> You know the Salarians could fix the Asari's long life problem...
[4:35:37] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt The Krogan live long too
[4:35:40] <%kyh9> I THINK I MIGHT PREFER ASHLEY TO JACOB
[4:35:42] <%X2Eliah> Jacob is terrible though
[4:35:43] <%sporeian94> Shepard is 31 if I recall
[4:35:44] <%Solid_Stro> @americanskidd They’re a delicacy sabert14Comfy
[4:35:44] <+ScottishMadJacko> like goddamn, they don't see the fruits of their research or anything
[4:35:47] <+flexin_apex> Vorcha have it worse but that’s on them
[4:35:49] <+DrSmashy> @Buzzkill983 I forgot about that
[4:35:51] <%jillpilled> Dr. Chorban I'm CIA
[4:35:53] <%Deft_Thought> I'm not worried about the authorities: I AM ONE!
[4:35:54] <%X2Eliah> No, scratch that ,Jacob is a big nothing
[4:35:54] <Goraka91> @kyh9 Hell no, Jacob is a piece of shit
[4:35:56] <%aBlueWizard> you should troll the chat and romance ashley through all 3 games
[4:36:00] <+evbites> @JaseAdrift so could a gun
[4:36:01] <%NovaKnightmare> Fuck C Sec, Fuck the Council, Fuck the State. Im Commander Shepard Bitch
[4:36:01] <+ScottishMadJacko> no wonder they're so morally corrupt when it comes to war crimes
[4:36:01] <%evilmagetim> Krogan natural causes are bullets
[4:36:03] <Mattais88> Is Ashley eating the bomb this playthough, or sticking around for extra "content"?
[4:36:07] <+AmericanSkidd> @Solid_Stro I GORGOT THAT LINE LUL
[4:36:09] <%DakotaMacDoodle> So they would probably have lived to around 25ish with our level of tech now.
[4:36:09] <DSD24> Jacob exists
[4:36:11] <+athuramn> finally, a normal response to a random guy coming by and saying "I can help "
[4:36:11] <+OG_M_Bison> @kyh9 Nah Kaiden is more interesting than all of them. Kaiden at least has the human biotic stuff in his backstory. All Miranda's got is a genetically modified ass
[4:36:15] <ape_hawk> he's making keeper porn
[4:36:32] <MagmaRam> @ape_hawk That explains how he can afford to pay you so much
[4:36:34] <+JaseAdrift> @evbites THATS EXACTLY HOW THEY FIX IT THE EASY WAY
[4:36:34] <%kyh9> @Goraka91 Yeah, I'm remembering how uninterested I was in nearly everything Jacob had to say and his loyalty mission in ME2.  And then how he cheats on Shepard in ME3?  Lmao
[4:36:37] <zenorot> Kaidan is not very memorable
[4:36:40] <Kidbizzaro> You think they would have researched the Keepers to hell at this point.
[4:36:42] <wasdsf> pargon pargon pargon
[4:36:43] <+DrSmashy> @ape_hawk GOTTA MAKE SURE THE 3D MODEL IS ACCURATE
[4:36:44] <DSD24> Ooo Pat's a Vanguard
[4:36:48] <%NovaKnightmare> Kaiden is Carth lite
[4:36:48] <%JoshManVGH> I want a mod that changes every one of Shepards introductions with "I'm commander shepard and this is my favorite store on the citadel"
[4:36:48] <+Buzzkill983> @DrSmashy It's actually a nice bit of side dialogue. Touched my kokoro
[4:36:48] <%dekkitout> The good boy probiotics
[4:36:50] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlinda
[4:36:53] <Lee_The_Limey> Worth it Kappa
[4:36:53] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind
[4:36:54] <xcompleasedad> Light Later
[4:36:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did they keep the bug in Noveria that gives infinite P/R points
[4:36:55] <DSD24> I like Adepts in ME1
[4:36:56] <%X2Eliah> @OG_M_Bison Miranda has actual family-related story and character growth, Kaidan has "ow, my heeead"
[4:36:56] <BinaryShuffle> Being a dick to her is never the wrong decision
[4:36:57] <+ScottishMadJacko> they actually removed a keeper for LE
[4:36:57] <%RetroCop87> And get that Karen juice OUTTA HERE
[4:37:03] <%NovaKnightmare> Carth sucks but at least hes a character
[4:37:03] <Grandnatics> I ain't giving up until you check the room map
[4:37:03] <%Aeoneth> You will surely get the Pargon
[4:37:06] <balthazar758> paragonia
[4:37:10] <+athuramn> *boing boing* it's really nice tho @og_m_bison
[4:37:12] <+OG_M_Bison> The one black squad mate and they made him lame as hell. Same with James and Latin culture smh
[4:37:12] <%RetroCop87> wait REALLY?
[4:37:13] <KohryuZX> Pat literally just wants to kill her in ME3
[4:37:15] <+Kaiserzelcor> "LEAVE"
[4:37:17] <%dekkitout> You promise
[4:37:18] <%X2Eliah> 4 keepers in tower area
[4:37:18] <RushUnplugged> @OG_M_Bison preach. People kill Kaiden after ignoring him all game, then say he's got nothing. He's vanilla AF but he's got his stuff. Still better than spaceracist
[4:37:18] <DSD24> Pat loves Carth so much
[4:37:19] <xcompleasedad> In a coffin LUL
[4:37:20] <+coolthulhuu> ashley is like aa turd sandwich while kaiden is a bread sandwich
[4:37:20] <%sporeian94> Hey pat open the map and look at it
[4:37:22] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:37:23] <%Spoonsire> You don't like the Space Racist, Pat?
[4:37:24] <+OmegaWeltall> who ya killin? Ashley or Kaiden Kappa
[4:37:24] <%NovaKnightmare> make Ashley live so she can suffer
[4:37:27] <Parapattern> Put Ashley's head in a toilet
[4:37:28] <Grandnatics> The map's room shape and outline is a cool detail of
[4:37:28] <+TheotherKristian> The Mass Effect 1 dilemma, would you be forgotten as a normal Kaiden, or be remembered as a Racist Ashley?!?!?
[4:37:30] <%Noir_Valdr> that's new
[4:37:33] <%Noir_Valdr> and it's great
[4:37:35] <+spartanghost004> easy do you want to just casually genocide or no?
[4:37:35] <dd44dostivei> it's new!
[4:37:37] <%X2Eliah> Still get tired super fast
[4:37:38] <%sporeian94> Pat open the map, let's take a look at this area see if it rings any bells!
[4:37:38] <%Bt_Robot> Just make sure to get Ashley's loyalty if you want to keep Wrex
[4:37:40] <+OG_M_Bison> @OG_M_Bison Just admit that you just like her ass bro LUL
[4:37:41] <%kyh9> @OG_M_Bison Kaiden's backstory is more interesting, but Miranda is more interesting to actually have around during missions.  Kaiden's personality is a wet blanket from ME1 to 3.  Miranda's turbo-bitch routine was entertaining a couple of times
[4:37:41] <xcompleasedad> That's a ME3 thing, I think
[4:37:41] <HyperionXV> Running outside of combat is new
[4:37:44] <%X2Eliah> Man it's insane how short the sprint time is
[4:37:45] <ianabstract> Shepard hasn't taken his space-inhaler tho so you can't run very far
[4:37:45] <+evbites> I like grey shepherd be nice but be ready to drop a bastard
[4:37:47] <%bugz_munny> that looks so bad
[4:37:50] <BinaryShuffle> Do the Shepard shuffle!
[4:37:51] <%NovaKnightmare> Shepard runs like he has to take a dump
[4:37:52] <%kyh9> AND YOU KNOW WHATS WEIRD
[4:37:54] <%bugz_munny> it looks like you need to take a shit
[4:37:55] <%Monkeyweed21> almost 15 years @PatStaresAt
[4:37:55] <Manjove> love how everyone just forgets that Ashley did have an interesting story with her family and the First Contact War
[4:37:55] <Mattais88> That animation is hilarious
[4:37:57] <%colezone_> colezone_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! I can't believe I'm gonna say this. But has been EA been not screwing people over the last few months or am I just uninformed.
[4:37:57] <Goraka91> @Bt_Robot No, it's Wrex's loyalty
[4:37:58] <zenith0111> We'll bang okay? woolieFABRICATION
[4:37:59] <+ScottishMadJacko> sprint faster if you pull your gun out btw
[4:38:00] <%topendbuzza> the word database is still broken in my head
[4:38:01] <notsoy> every character voiced by that guy was an annoying wet blanket
[4:38:02] <DSD24> Got all these mind powers yet you can't run for 10 seconds
[4:38:04] <dd44dostivei> you also don't have to scan EVERY keeper. there's one less
[4:38:04] <+AmericanSkidd> @TheotherKristian Normal Kaiden is at least inoffensive
[4:38:08] <+OG_M_Bison> @OG_M_Bison She's not entertaining after they took the ass shots out of ME2 Kappa
[4:38:08] <@StridentSong> Nice to see this quest still sucks as much as it did back in the day
[4:38:08] <%kyh9> VEGA IS THE SECOND BEST HUMAN COMPANION
[4:38:11] <%bugz_munny> @NovaKnightmare lol dead on
[4:38:13] <%X2Eliah> naw, you talk to Kahoku *after* you find his team
[4:38:14] <%kyh9> HE BEATS OUT MIRANDA, JACOB, ASHLEY AND KAIDEN
[4:38:15] <%NovaKnightmare> hes waiting for the script
[4:38:15] <+evbites> @Manjove it wasn't interesting
[4:38:16] <xcompleasedad> Yes
[4:38:17] <%Monkeyweed21> DATABASE DATABASE WHOA OHHH
[4:38:19] <DSD24> @Manjove and how her Grandpa got screwed over for saving lives
[4:38:20] <%spoiledbadger> is there a mod that increases the stamina?
[4:38:21] <Mattais88> He's waiting for the cereberus bullet in his head
[4:38:25] <Broken_Sonex> @OG_M_Bison I will. It's a great ass
[4:38:27] <CurrentQuiet> !uptime
[4:38:27] <@Moobot> @CurrentQuiet I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 38m.
[4:38:28] <Goraka91> I never completed it
[4:38:29] <@StridentSong> Yeap. There's always one
[4:38:31] <%sporeian94> That one by the fucking normandy... every time
[4:38:32] <%afronooch> yeah i had to pull up a guide lol
[4:38:32] <%Noir_Valdr> it's actually less suck now, you only need 20 out of 21 keepers now
[4:38:36] <+FelIian> @PatStaresAt you can alter the Coalesced file to change the storm length and FOV, I can link to a google doc with one already changed for you? @PatStaresAt
[4:38:37] <%kyh9> Vega, the Jersey Shore companion, is more interesting than the starting companions from the first 2 games
[4:38:41] <%sporeian94> Pat before you go let's look at the map!
[4:38:42] <Dfreddy8> Vega sucks
[4:38:42] <Grandnatics> Yooo Pat open the map before you leave this room
[4:38:42] <+OG_M_Bison> The funny thing is that Kaiden actually gets interesting in ME3 but most people don't care :(
[4:38:43] <dd44dostivei> the game lets you miss one keeper now
[4:38:44] <+JaseAdrift> The fact that they didnt update this fucking sucks
[4:38:45] <%QueequegTheater> Imagine if they changed the locations
[4:38:49] <DSD24> Mordi is the best
[4:38:49] <BinaryShuffle> Is the quest reward worth it?
[4:38:50] <RushUnplugged> Ashley's backstory isn't interesting. Grampa's a soldier who got a bad break? Boo hoo, get over it, space Karen
[4:38:52] <DSD24> Mordin
[4:38:59] <Goraka91> @kyh9 I kinda like Kaiden, his backstory is neat
[4:39:01] <+OG_M_Bison> @kyh9 James is not more interesting than Kaiden LUL you're on crack
[4:39:03] <Grandnatics> THE MAP
[4:39:04] <$Futurecity10> Just a heads up pat you will not have enough charm to do the Sole survivor intill like 2 main missions
[4:39:06] <Manjove> @DSD24 and how she is years due for a promotion but is being held down for it
[4:39:07] <%QueequegTheater> @BinaryShuffle no
[4:39:08] <%sporeian94> Pat didn't look at the map...
[4:39:09] <%JoshManVGH> Had an easier time with it this time because of the load times. It makes scouring every corner for Keepers not fucking SUCK
[4:39:10] <+Buzzkill983> Ashley has some funny lines in ME3 dlc. They tone down the racism A LOT too
[4:39:10] <+AceNugget> pancake buttcam
[4:39:14] <+Philoceraptors> @PatStaresAt open the map
[4:39:15] <%topendbuzza> just pop in to spot
[4:39:15] <%spoiledbadger> YEAH THE MUSIC
[4:39:16] <%X2Eliah> man look at these 3 dweebs
[4:39:16] <%Deft_Thought> It's not a bad way to incentivize players to explore the citadel by scanning keepers
[4:39:19] <%sporeian94> This music
[4:39:20] <+coolthulhuu> the elevator music is jsut really loud
[4:39:22] <%RetroCop87> TURN UP YOUR VOICE A BIT, ASHLEY
[4:39:23] <+DrSmashy> @kyh9 But he can do so many push-ups
[4:39:24] <+TheotherKristian> Look at the elevator move so fucking fast
[4:39:24] <ghoostyberry> yms
[4:39:24] <%X2Eliah> Pat all voices are kinda quiet
[4:39:26] <%bugz_munny> Why is the music so loud compared to them lol
[4:39:27] <%mr_whet_faartz> hype elevator music
[4:39:27] <MagmaRam> god I love the elevator music
[4:39:28] <+flexin_apex> I always miss the one in the hanger every time
[4:39:28] <%MidnightBurst12> this is great
[4:39:28] <%kyh9> @Goraka91 Backstory has never been enough to carry a companion in my books, especialyl when I have to deal with them for hours
[4:39:30] <+JaseAdrift> audio is fucked her i guess
[4:39:30] <+AmericanSkidd> Elevator fast as fuck now boi
[4:39:31] <Grandnatics> The quiet voices in the elevator was like this in the original
[4:39:31] <+FelIian> Storm is sprint btw, so can make Shepard run Forever
[4:39:34] <willyfreshness> SHUT UP ASH
[4:39:37] <ape_hawk> its so quiet in the elevator
[4:39:38] <+Kaiserzelcor> I like how the choice between killing them is so hard cause they both suck so bad
[4:39:39] <Profmcstevie> Must be one of those racism cancelling elevators
[4:39:41] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Feliz navidad
[4:39:41] <%sporeian94> LOOK AT IT
[4:39:42] <DSD24> Its a nice map
[4:39:43] <%Noir_Valdr> DAT'S A REAPER
[4:39:43] <Dunmarkh> ashley is a centrist
[4:39:44] <%dekkitout> This elevator music is pretty top
[4:39:45] <+ScottishMadJacko> Why are they so quiet actually
[4:39:45] <+OG_M_Bison> @Buzzkill983 Only time I let Ashley make it to ME3 I domed her myself
[4:39:46] <MagmaRam> OH MY GOD THE MAP SHAPE
[4:39:47] <BinaryShuffle> @QueequegTheater TY, I never bothered in any of my playthroughs LUL
[4:39:48] <%Monkeyweed21> OH
[4:39:49] <+luckyguywiththumbs> pennis
[4:39:49] <Grandnatics> Shape of a reaper
[4:39:50] <RushUnplugged> Map: Reaper shaped
[4:39:51] <%X2Eliah> .... do you not recognize that shape?
[4:39:51] <willyfreshness> is the map Reaper shaped?
[4:39:52] <%topendbuzza> that is a penis map
[4:39:53] <ghoostyberry> i just think of yourmoviesucks when i hear that song
[4:39:53] <%blutzwavedave> Looks like a REAPER
[4:39:54] <ianabstract> That map does look like da reaper
[4:39:54] <%sporeian94> the shape of it
[4:39:55] <%Noir_Valdr> look at the silhouette of the map Pat
[4:39:55] <pth88> it looks like soveriegn
[4:39:56] <%Monkeyweed21> YEP
[4:39:57] <%kyh9> @OG_M_Bison Vega is more interesting to actually have around.  Kaiden has an interesting backstory and a dead-fish for personality
[4:39:59] <+ScottishMadJacko> Didn't have that on ps
[4:40:00] <+AceNugget> the vo probably stays at the original spot in the elevator shaft
[4:40:00] <Goraka91> @kyh9 I'm just saying he's better than Vega
[4:40:05] <%Noir_Valdr> YUP
[4:40:08] <+spartanghost004> Kaidan the sensible boring one
[4:40:09] <%Noir_Valdr> it totally does
[4:40:10] <%X2Eliah> kinda
[4:40:11] <+evbites> @RushUnplugged ASH: ughh everyone is always insulting me and my family        Shepard: When?
[4:40:11] <%sporeian94> Yeah it's a reaper, COINCIDENCE!?!?
[4:40:13] <Basch71> the map does
[4:40:14] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS THE SILHOUETTE
[4:40:16] <Mattais88> OH SIT IT IS
[4:40:17] <%jillpilled> This keeper used to have some bug with it right?
[4:40:21] <+OG_M_Bison> @Dunmarkh She comes from a military family and holds conservatives values. She's def right
[4:40:22] <%RageCasanova> Maaan
[4:40:24] <+AmericanSkidd> THERE HE IS, HE'S HERE
[4:40:24] <+Buzzkill983> Wait I didn't notice that!
[4:40:26] <DSD24> Honestly I leave Kaiden or Ashley depending on my class that playthrough
[4:40:26] <Case_Ah_Dia> I think the noise from the elevator is cancelling out the audio
[4:40:27] <Goraka91> It is time
[4:40:28] <pth88> Who is Pat leaving on Virmire?
[4:40:28] <%sporeian94> HERe'S THE GREATEST RACE OF ALL TIME
[4:40:30] <MagmaRam> time to fuck with the Big Stupid Jellyfish

[4:40:49] <%X2Eliah> BLASTO
[4:40:49] <+RoByte2> Glory to the Enkindlers!
[4:40:50] <%kyh9> @Goraka91 Again, I disagree.  I've had Kaiden for long stretches of ME1 and ME3 and his presence basically doesn't register in my brain.  Vega is at least sort of funny because of how stupid and meat-head he is
[4:40:51] <+FelIian> @OG_M_Bison she's also a bitch to everyone in the group meetings, mainly Liara
[4:40:51] <%Rumbutt> BLASTO
[4:40:52] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Aw yeah let’s go blasto
[4:40:54] <+ScottishMadJacko> Big stupid jellyfish
[4:40:56] <%sunsetdisc0> "it"
[4:40:57] <MagmaRam> because it's a BIG STUPID JELLYFISH

[4:40:59] <+OmegaWeltall> I Simp for Elcor
[4:40:59] <+Buzzkill983> It's not smart enough
[4:40:59] <+flexin_apex> Each squad mate say something near those statues in the water
[4:41:01] <Mattais88> I'm not smart enough?
[4:41:05] <%aBlueWizard> This one has enkindled many females across the galaxy.
[4:41:06] <buhbuhboat> BECAUSE ITS A BIG STUPID JELLYFISH
[4:41:06] <CatsDrunkonCopper> playable jellyfish when?
[4:41:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @gaelic_otaku the floor plan of the Citadel Tower is Reaper Shaped
[4:41:13] <critiquequartz> He’s not as cool as the hanar Spector blasto
[4:41:16] <%X2Eliah> The best part is, the Hanar religion is legitimately nonsense
[4:41:17] <%MisterRockett> I really think someone who hates politics shouldn't be a soilder.
[4:41:19] <%sporeian94> ANTI-FREEDOM OF SPEECH
[4:41:22] <Goraka91> @kyh9 At any rate they're not any of the aliens so it doesn't matter LUL
[4:41:23] <+OG_M_Bison> @OG_M_Bison Non of James lines sound authentic. It all sounds like someone phoning in a stereotypical latino dialect
[4:41:37] <MagmaRam> "weeds out undesirables" jfc
[4:41:38] <+Troispoint> U N D E S I R A B L E S
[4:41:38] <+flexin_apex> This one
[4:41:40] <+OG_M_Bison> THE JELLY????
[4:41:41] <%kyh9> @Goraka91 True, they're not aliens and not jack so they all pale in comparison
[4:41:41] <DSD24> I love these animations
[4:41:43] <%Rumbutt> BIG SPACISM
[4:41:45] <Mattais88> JELLY?!
[4:41:45] <Goraka91> Wow, jelly huh?
[4:41:46] <%jillpilled> Undesirables monkaS
[4:41:46] <+bubblebasspickles> "jelly"
[4:41:47] <+OG_M_Bison> That's a micro transgression
[4:41:47] <BlindGato> JELLY
[4:41:47] <CyberKN> Is Jelly a racist term?
[4:41:48] <AngryAsian5> J E L L Y
[4:41:49] <BinaryShuffle> I think that's a racial ephithet
[4:41:49] <%sporeian94> This is literally the 2000's "Free speech zone" debate
[4:41:50] <DSD24> These are YEARS OLD animations
[4:41:52] <balthazar758> undesirables huh
[4:41:54] <%dekkitout> Are they wrong?
[4:41:57] <TonberryLives> Is jelly a slur in this context?
[4:41:57] <Broken_Sonex> THE JELLY, HUH?!
[4:41:58] <Mattais88> TWICE
[4:41:59] <MagmaRam> @CyberKN Probably
[4:42:00] <AngryAsian5> Help! Help! I'm being oppressed
[4:42:00] <+spartanghost004> Vocally volent
[4:42:01] <%kyh9> Jack, Zaeed and Kasumi just blow the Alliance and Cerberus humans out of the fucking water

[4:42:09] <CurrentQuiet> stubborn jelly
[4:42:12] <+Calek> This is the way
[4:42:12] <%kyh9> HTHIS ONE IS BEING OPPRESSED
[4:42:15] <Mattais88> ENKINDLERS
[4:42:15] <+AmericanSkidd> This one requests you go fuck yourself
[4:42:17] <%RetroCop87> little column A, little column B
[4:42:20] <+OG_M_Bison> I mean the Hanar is literally being oppressed right now LUL
[4:42:20] <%X2Eliah> ME3 has a villain Hanar and he is SO. COOL.
[4:42:22] <+SoySocks> this one?
[4:42:23] <+critikal_bit> God the Hanar's voice is SO GOOD
[4:42:28] <+OG_M_Bison> They're telling him he can't spread his religion
[4:42:29] <+Buzzkill983> I love it when you get Hanar to see Protean dlc character in 3. He fucking loses it
[4:42:37] <%dekkitout> Enkindler- I dont know how to feel about that name
[4:42:39] <+evbites> Also, does it count as religion if they were literally ascended
[4:42:43] <Goraka91> Pay the tax
[4:42:44] <+Buzzkill983> Prothean. Damn it
[4:42:47] <TonberryLives> UUUUGGGHHHHH
[4:42:47] <%weissguard> So buy the permit.
[4:42:48] <akitanito> the truth cannot afford $$$
[4:42:48] <%bugz_munny> hes not wrong
[4:42:51] <+itsgundamu> I mean
[4:42:53] <%RetroCop87> Is it tho?
[4:42:53] <%QueequegTheater> Hanar says "First Amendment, bitch"
[4:42:54] <%MidnightBurst12> oh boy
[4:42:57] <buhbuhboat> Hanar voice actor is also Mark Meer IIRC
[4:43:03] <MagmaRam> The jellyfish is not wrong.
[4:43:03] <%sporeian94> This isn't America unfortunately, those freedoms aren't guarenteed
[4:43:03] <Profmcstevie> ....you jelly boys got no cash huh
[4:43:04] <Broken_Sonex> HMMMMMM.
[4:43:06] <willyfreshness> every hanar is squeaky voiced teen to me
[4:43:10] <SaltyAzteca> Hanar, sing In the air tonight!!
[4:43:14] <BinaryShuffle> This one says "Taxes are theft"
[4:43:15] <Goraka91> @buhbuhboat Oh noooooo
[4:43:15] <+spartanghost004> the truth of the truth of the Prothean truth of the space fish
[4:43:17] <%kyh9> I mean, places have rules
[4:43:20] <%X2Eliah> IT IS PREACHING
[4:43:21] <Dunmarkh> fuck this guy
[4:43:23] <+coolthulhuu> ok so maybe fuck the jelly LUL
[4:43:26] <DSD24> Ah yes Protheans
[4:43:31] <Broken_Sonex> YOU BIG STUPID JELLYFISH
[4:43:32] <ape_hawk> hes... not wrong?
[4:43:33] <DSD24> We dismissed that claim
[4:43:34] <MagmaRam> HANG ON A SECOND. Does the Turian using the term "Jelly" mean that jellyfish are present on non-Earth planets, and also that they're called jellyfish in Turian language?
[4:43:34] <zenorot> Heh
[4:43:34] <%weissguard> I see this Hanar is "travelling"
[4:43:35] <willyfreshness> the hanar were a mistake
[4:43:35] <%bread_assassin> MY RELIGION IS FACTUAL
[4:43:35] <%topendbuzza> oh
[4:43:36] <Goraka91> I wouldn't be surprised, Protheans were into a lot of shit
[4:43:36] <%bugz_munny> he's actually right though
[4:43:38] <+OG_M_Bison> @sporeian94 Even in America you'll be surveyed and watched by the government at all times if you're Muslim
[4:43:39] <%dekkitout> Oh...
[4:43:40] <+AmericanSkidd> Space Jesus
[4:43:43] <+athuramn> he's super right
[4:43:44] <+evbites> it's history not realigon
[4:43:48] <MagmaRam> @weissguard LUL
[4:43:50] <MarylandJutsu> yep
[4:43:51] <%X2Eliah> Yeah
[4:43:51] <%blutzwavedave> Javik came in some goo and made the Hanar
[4:43:52] <CurrentQuiet> the hanar and only the hanar should be allowed to preach they're voices are so good
[4:43:56] <%RetroCop87> but then it's not a religion, it's histiory
[4:43:59] <%za7az> So it's not preaching then?
[4:44:01] <%Ranryu692> Ugandan Hanar
[4:44:07] <aiutare47> @MagmaRam or its the closest translation the translator could find
[4:44:07] <%Solid_Stro> I’ll have one of your “gods” as a party member later on
[4:44:09] <Mattais88> Never trust something who you can't see where their brain is
[4:44:10] <Goraka91> Protheans were playing Stellaris and uplifing them primitives into their glorious empire
[4:44:10] <+evbites> HISTORY
[4:44:13] <+OG_M_Bison> Hanar should've been playable in ME3
[4:44:14] <DSD24> oh nooo
[4:44:15] <%QueequegTheater> Pat HATES religious freedom Kappa
[4:44:15] <+Calek> ohhh misses out on the paragon choice

[4:44:27] <%Xevtes> @Mattais88 so everyone?
[4:44:28] <%sporeian94> Just buy the permit
[4:44:29] <DSD24> Not Paragon or Renegade enough
[4:44:29] <%bassoontyphoon> Javik put his gamer goo in some primordial ooze and the Hanar came out
[4:44:29] <+evbites> @Mattais88 you can it glows
[4:44:30] <%Monkeyweed21> LAUGHABLE CENTRIST PAT

[4:44:44] <+spartanghost004> youdon;t have enough power
[4:44:44] <Vi_Stri> I can't believe someone as important as Javik was DLC
[4:44:47] <ralphfromdk> You should be able to be nicer in a level or two
[4:44:48] <+spartanghost004> you don't
[4:44:49] <%Solid_Stro> Or
[4:44:49] <+OG_M_Bison> Centrist Pat LUL
[4:44:51] <%sporeian94> PAT WE GOTTA GO FIND OUR GARBEAR
[4:45:00] <%Mr_Pylon> and Red Bard Go Home
[4:45:00] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat did you not put pointsinto Charm?
[4:45:01] <%dekkitout> How old is that specific Hanar?
[4:45:05] <+SoySocks> 60fps and use a wire
[4:45:07] <willyfreshness> The one true framerate
[4:45:07] <%Order_of_Mystery> 60fps and rollback or bust
[4:45:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> thats a pretty good religion tho
[4:45:12] <+Troispoint> I love how space travel is here but still can't have a full head of hair
[4:45:13] <%blutzwavedave> @kyh9 LUL
[4:45:14] <+ScottishMadJacko> thats a good one tho
[4:45:17] <Dfreddy8> GARRUS
[4:45:17] <kago_dev> NotLikeThis I turned my game to fidelity 30fps mode, and a man came to my home and took my games.
[4:45:17] <ralphfromdk> Aaaah, the religion of the Total Bisquit
[4:45:22] <+evbites> @dekkitout 9999?
[4:45:25] <tranquilturnip> Pat are you gonna sell out to every store on citadel
[4:45:29] <MagmaRam> I thought you get more charm points when you become a spectre
[4:45:32] <%Monkeyweed21> pat the laughable centrist cant convince the jelly
[4:45:34] <%Taisuru> I can't believe Virtua Fighter is getting a new game and is STILL dead
[4:45:36] <%X2Eliah> Ohok. So you literally need to "get good"
[4:45:38] <%Rumbutt> You require more NARC POINTS
[4:45:43] <+OG_M_Bison> @Troispoint Balding is a stylistic choice in the universe
[4:45:46] <+spartanghost004> yes
[4:45:48] <%spoiledbadger> go tell atlus that on that smt3 pc port
[4:45:50] <zenorot> alignment system is so bad
[4:45:54] <%kyh9> You get more AUTHORITY
[4:45:55] <ralphfromdk> All hail the tophat of the Bisquit
[4:45:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Is this still the Normandy?
[4:46:01] <%bugz_munny> yeah you can max both
[4:46:02] <%dekkitout> Charm? Or an "incentive presence"
[4:46:04] <%Monkeyweed21> pargon point

[4:46:13] <%kyh9> Authority, Challenging Success: "Tell him you are a Spectre and that you are THE LAW"
[4:46:13] <CurrentQuiet> @suckerpunchsyd no, citadel
[4:46:15] <+OG_M_Bison> @zenorot Agreed. Needs a New Vegas do whatever you want system.
[4:46:16] <Archmortal> it's honestly best to leave most of the side stuff till you're a spectre just for the ability to boost charm/intimidate
[4:46:17] <+ScottishMadJacko> not gonna beeline garrus and Wrex?
[4:46:19] <+athuramn> @suckerpunchsyd this the citadel
[4:46:20] <%topendbuzza> gezz
[4:46:20] <%Solid_Stro> The end of my gun barrel is really charming I swear sabert14Gun
[4:46:24] <+AmericanSkidd> I think its impossible to hit cap on the first playthrough
[4:46:24] <Mattais88> I remeber have too muc EXP so I started putting it into intimidate instead
[4:46:29] <+superrhubarbpie> bioware really did hit it out of the park with this universe huh
[4:46:32] <buhbuhboat> im glad paragon and renagade feed into the same bar in me3
[4:46:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @currentquiet @athuramn aah gotcha thanks!!
[4:46:42] <%sporeian94> Hey Nassana hope you don't get shot by a lizard man
[4:46:42] <feralspidey> PAt, don't say that
[4:46:45] <nesbitt22> 60 the cap right?
[4:46:47] <%RetroCop87> No, I want food
[4:46:52] <%X2Eliah> @buhbuhboat That was a really good change
[4:46:54] <+evbites> @buhbuhboat they do?
[4:46:54] <CyberKN> This is a crappy bar
[4:46:54] <%topendbuzza> most aliens are space aliens
[4:46:54] <+flexin_apex> In feros u get tons para pts
[4:46:56] <+OG_M_Bison> @superrhubarbpie The world building is the best part of the series easily. Characters second.
[4:46:59] <%scaryboisupreme> a bar that doesn't sell drinks
[4:47:01] <Mattais88> Is he spinning a turntable/
[4:47:02] <Archmortal> @AmericanSkidd LE made it possible without exploits but you gotta kill nearly everything instead of using diplomacy
[4:47:11] <%X2Eliah> @nesbitt22 Yeah, but in LE they messed up the exp numbers a bit, 60 is not reachable
[4:47:18] <zenorot> even the system in SMT does more than simple good guy bad guy choices
[4:47:19] <+flexin_apex> No rag in hand lol
[4:47:21] <MagmaRam> So Sha'ira is just a therapist right
[4:47:24] <%dekkitout> She's a fortune teller?
[4:47:26] <+evbites> @superrhubarbpie last place is resource getting
[4:47:35] <+Troispoint> ''Sha'iras'' as in ''Ça ira''?
[4:47:36] <Mattais88> but she's not a woman, per se
[4:47:38] <%kyh9> Very powerful blue sex maniac
[4:47:38] <%X2Eliah> @MagmaRam No, you can get down with her
[4:47:44] <+AmericanSkidd> @Archmortal Well good if you wanna renegade I guess
[4:47:47] <%Monkeyweed21> gotta do the Shep Herd
[4:47:47] <buhbuhboat> @buhbuhboat Yeah you just have a "reputation" bar which paragon and renagade both feed into
[4:47:57] <Broken_Sonex> Sha'ira got them blue milkers, you know?
[4:48:00] <+evbites> @dekkitout and a hooker
[4:48:06] <%aBlueWizard> took me 2 play throughs to max level, making sure to kill everything
[4:48:07] <+OG_M_Bison> @MagmaRam She comforts people by talking, cuddling, and mind melding I believe
[4:48:11] <%aBlueWizard> doing all side quest
[4:48:12] <mar_krow> My favourite informant on the ciditel
[4:48:14] <%X2Eliah> Yeah; LE exp mode was supposed to make it single-playthroughable
[4:48:15] <+ScottishMadJacko> I did everything and hit 28 or 29 on LE
[4:48:16] <+Troispoint> Mind sex hmmm
[4:48:19] <Mattais88> I hit it halfway through the second, but I scraped
[4:48:19] <+spartanghost004> I just did all of the extra and the dlc
[4:48:20] <%Andrizzleton> true i think i was 2..5 playthroughs before i hit 60
[4:48:21] <%JoshManVGH> Now, only one!
[4:48:21] <%sporeian94> YOu basically have to do all the sidequests
[4:48:23] <RushUnplugged> the lvl60 cap wasn't even possible on the first run since it unlocks from the 2nd
[4:48:25] <Archmortal> it IS possible to hit it in one now, just really gotta murder-hobo
[4:48:25] <pth88> yyou couldnt do insanity until NG+
[4:48:34] <%RetroCop87> what, like a Pokemon?
[4:48:36] <%bugz_munny> wouldnt he say wrex?
[4:48:36] <buhbuhboat> in the original game you got like no xp from killing things in the mako, they removed that in LE so you get alot more xp
[4:48:37] <AmuserName> @PatStaresAt You could usually hit about LV55 - 56 through abusing the EXP system by getting out of the Mako to kill big-exp monsters.
[4:48:38] <%valriot> SHEPHARD COMMANDER
[4:48:40] <+AmericanSkidd> Consort is just a future expensive Vtuber
[4:48:42] <%walternatorz> I remember attacking all the thresher maws with the mako until landing the final hit with a sniper rifle to get extra xp
[4:48:43] <+spartanghost004> Shepard the worlds greatest soldier
[4:48:44] <%TheMattman1313> U think the Infinite Paragon/Renegade glitch also provided infiite XP
[4:48:44] <MagmaRam> @MagmaRam tbf my therapist would probably be more effective if she could mind meld
[4:48:46] <%sporeian94> I should go
[4:48:51] <%dekkitout> That sounds very Branigan of him
[4:48:51] <Ranger747> da nanana mirrors edge
[4:48:52] <%jillpilled> I should go
[4:48:54] <%Deft_Thought> "Ngh, ooof, SHEPHARD."
[4:48:57] <Broken_Sonex> HAA HHAA I'M SHEPARD, HAAAA OH GOD
[4:49:02] <+Calek> @AmuserName killing things while inside the mako gives exp now
[4:49:05] <CrypticMochi> You could reach 59 if you did everything including the planets
[4:49:05] <lotusdagoat> is this shepard supposed to look like pat?
[4:49:09] <%sporeian94> LET'S GO GET GARRUS
[4:49:12] <%bugz_munny> dude therapist that mind meld would be SO SICK
[4:49:14] <Goraka91> LUL

[4:49:17] <%za7az> LUL

[4:49:18] <+OG_M_Bison> @MagmaRam Same Kreygasm
[4:49:18] <feralspidey> reminds me of playing the arkham games, and saying "im batman" everytime i got hit
[4:49:21] <Archmortal> thankfully to make hitting 60 easy in one go, the EXP bug with Therum still exists
[4:49:22] <%QueequegTheater> GAS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY CHEAP NOW, SAREN
[4:49:25] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL

[4:49:51] <%scaryboisupreme> "hey remember when we genocided these dudes"
[4:49:51] <%mr_whet_faartz> and ashley is spewing spacist shit in the back
[4:49:52] <%Mr_Pylon> Screaming at the Council like Deacon does at that podcast
[4:49:52] <OldOnyx> deekin... the kobold?
[4:49:56] <Broken_Sonex> Shepard IS fucking crazy if you really think about it
[4:49:57] <+ScottishMadJacko> peach is making ice cream with plague
[4:49:58] <Explodincatz> Mass Gone
[4:49:59] <notsoy> that running animation is so weird
[4:50:03] <+yoshkosh20> and your party member would reacat to the crazy mutterings. It would be so fun.
[4:50:04] <%za7az> We need more games where the main character is just a little batshit crazy LUL
[4:50:04] <%TheLemuroid> Go on...

[4:50:29] <%sporeian94> where at the end they just did anime grunts as 2B and 9S and it was just sex noises
[4:50:30] <%Rumbutt> NICE
[4:50:31] <TonberryLives> THAT'S FANTASTIC
[4:50:32] <ianabstract> I love the little wall on this bridge to give the 360 time to load the other side of it
[4:50:32] <%X2Eliah> keepor boop

[4:50:34] <+flexin_apex> The squad mates say something near those statues
[4:50:39] <+evbites> so the definitive playthrough
[4:50:41] <+itsgundamu> dang sounds like you'd get in trouble for that

[4:54:25] <%RetroCop87> I DON'T TRUST HER
[4:54:26] <%AncelDeLambert> although, that said, in 2 you hear about Asari porn videos, and I don't think their telepathy works across that
[4:54:27] <+spartanghost004> this is why when the asari find everyone attractive
[4:54:28] <%SirGO0SE> all he do is eat hot chip and lie
[4:54:28] <+AmericanSkidd> That conversation in 2
[4:54:34] <Realimpact> don't touch my face, lady
[4:54:36] <+Calek> a conversation from a bunch of drunk people
[4:54:39] <metalliec> @OG_M_Bison nah the vidja garme destiny 2. randos that join you are called blueberries

[4:54:47] <DatAsuna> I think people chalking that up to powers was just being dense
[4:54:47] <+SataruYamate> salarian, turian and humanm
[4:54:48] <Grandnatics> Human Salarian Turian
[4:54:49] <+senfood> Imagine having pussy game so amazing that you maintain a sizable amount of power on the most powerful space station in the galaxy.
[4:54:50] <+Calek> salarian bachelor party
[4:54:51] <%AzureGale> They were at a bachelor's party
[4:54:51] <%Mr_Pylon> Turian, Salasian and Human
[4:54:51] <%sporeian94> It's a bachelor party on Illium
[4:54:52] <%dekkitout> That sounds like the setup for a bad space joke
[4:54:52] <tranquilturnip> LUL
[4:54:52] <+spartanghost004> Turain, salarian, and a human pat
[4:54:55] <stantheman_97> i fucking love the conversation

[4:55:04] <%Bt_Robot> ME
[4:55:07] <%topendbuzza> human face
[4:55:09] <+evbites> ***
[4:55:12] <DatAsuna> It came off more as being about social biases for their perspective, not implying that they're magic projecting into your eyes
[4:55:13] <Goraka91> Each race just focuses on the features they like
[4:55:16] <%dekkitout> K
[4:55:17] <Broken_Sonex> @AncelDeLambert This
[4:55:24] <%sporeian94> THEY'RE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
[4:55:24] <%toastybites> and all the children they have are Asari no matter what
[4:55:25] <$Hommando> Couldn't an artist of each species just draw what they see?
[4:55:26] <+DrSmashy> space famitsu
[4:55:31] <+spartanghost004> The stripper was upset by the fact they were discussing it
[4:55:34] <+OG_M_Bison> @metalliec Just compared to Halo I didn't like it as much. And Borderlands fills the same niche for me and is more fun
[4:55:35] <%Bt_Robot> They all look different
[4:55:35] <Ids560> what's up with her eyes?
[4:55:36] <Goraka91> FOR SOME REASON
[4:55:42] <DatAsuna> It's the blind men touching the elephant story basically yes
[4:55:43] <lotusdagoat> damn thats really interesting
[4:55:43] <Mattais88> But what about hanar
[4:55:44] <%sporeian94> Are you aware of the asari mind meld pegging sex conspiracy
[4:55:45] <%valriot> Elcor rolls up "They got huge dongs like us though"
[4:55:45] <mar_krow> Asari r like mew many DNA
[4:55:45] <CurrentQuiet> and they're hot yo
[4:55:47] <Daniel_Is_I> Everybody wants to fuck the Asari
[4:55:50] <%YakumoYomi> And then they're like "Do Asari manipulate our minds to appear attractive to everyone?"
[4:55:50] <+OG_M_Bison> Just wish Bungie went on to do better things
[4:55:51] <stantheman_97> it's really interesting
[4:55:53] <%RetroCop87> Also, the Asari are all naturally about fucking with other races
[4:55:53] <Maids4lyfe> but then the Krogan see them as Krogan-like
[4:55:54] <spuginky> and fat titas
[4:55:59] <+AmericanSkidd> Humans, Quarians, and Asari have titties
[4:55:59] <%dekkitout> Twi'lek, got it...
[4:56:00] <Dfreddy8> Shepard has 3 daughters
[4:56:00] <zenorot> So the asari use chemicals to trick people into mating
[4:56:00] <+athuramn> tali was hotter D:<
[4:56:01] <lotusdagoat> i dont wanna fuck an asari
[4:56:04] <feralspidey> The Asari are the Galactic Tricycle... if the Tricycle could mind-meld
[4:56:05] <+OG_M_Bison> @YakumoYomi I think they do actually
[4:56:07] <metalliec> @OG_M_Bison i blame @AmericanSkidd
[4:56:11] <+spartanghost004> maybe even the same parts you don't know
[4:56:12] <%AncelDeLambert> they're the most ideal sapiency form
[4:56:13] <+Peacefrog7> kind of like that episode of tng with the "perfect mate" lady
[4:56:18] <%TheMattman1313> ANd/or the Protheans
[4:56:19] <%dekkitout> But everything evolves into crab
[4:56:20] <TonberryLives> I can dig it
[4:56:22] <+OG_M_Bison> @metalliec Same

[4:56:33] <%topendbuzza> nah it was bio being lazy and only wanting one rig

[4:56:38] <%maenos2> LUL
[4:56:38] <Hellarussian> you're too close man, you're too close
[4:56:38] <+dreadsnappi> seems like fake news

[4:57:15] <KetsuoTaberu> We'll bang, ok?
[4:57:17] <+AceNugget> the Asari are using you take the space redpill
[4:57:18] <%sporeian94> so you don't even nut inside them
[4:57:18] <Twoiis> Ashley hates politics.
[4:57:20] <%Bt_Robot> Why is she using the crazy Liara face expressions?
[4:57:21] <xcompleasedad> IT'S GREAT, SHUT UP
[4:57:23] <%RetroCop87> It's like he's doing the Jenson sidle, but moving forward
[4:57:23] <@StridentSong> You run as well as you dance, Shepard
[4:57:24] <%Ravioli_Ronin> We’ll bang, ok?
[4:57:25] <zenorot> the running in this game LUL
[4:57:27] <TonberryLives> SHEPPARD
[4:57:29] <feralspidey> Shepard AwaaaY!!! (this is gonna be a great playthrough)
[4:57:29] <+JaseAdrift> Shepard just sucks with his legs
[4:57:31] <+yoshkosh20> awkward dad jog
[4:57:31] <%Paperware> Well at least he runs for about as long as Pat can...
[4:57:34] <+senfood> I, for one, embrace our new Asari onaholes.
[4:57:36] <%Rumbutt> What's worse: Shephard's running or Shephard's Dancing
[4:57:36] <%Taisuru> He must poo
[4:57:37] <Thepothero> Poop walk rooKek
[4:57:43] <wasdsf> the krogan did nothing wrong
[4:57:43] <+spartanghost004> Pat has chosen sex
[4:57:44] <rekinom> Shepard but he's zap brannigan
[4:57:46] <+DrSmashy> bring wrex to see it
[4:57:47] <lloyddboy> DEDICATED TO THE BRAVE SOLDIERS OF THE MUHAJIDEEN
[4:57:47] <%THATGUY_789> go Shepard go
[4:57:48] <+ScottishMadJacko> aria is the hottest asari
[4:57:52] <+yoshkosh20> @Rumbutt yes
[4:57:52] <%NovaKnightmare> We erect this in honor of all the balls of the Korgans
[4:57:53] <%Andrizzleton> the run cycle is that weird jog your you see your 60 yr old neighbor do
[4:57:53] <Dfreddy8> Kappa
[4:57:53] <Goraka91> Rachni did nothing wrong either
[4:57:54] <+AmericanSkidd> I wont say no to most ME races
[4:57:55] <Mattais88> But come back with Wrex and GArrus and hear them talk about it
[4:57:58] <metalliec> @StridentSong why did the krogan rebel?
[4:57:58] <AthenaAegis> Run looks like he needs to take a shit while wearing pants too tight a size
[4:58:01] <Srthunda> just wait until you dont
[4:58:01] <+corybantic> mass effect is awesome
[4:58:02] <%Sweetangy021> @Rumbutt Dancing but his general locomotion is bad
[4:58:02] <lotusdagoat> @rumbutt bruh his moves are smooth af
[4:58:03] <ralphfromdk> And to all the krogan babies killed after he war was over LUL
[4:58:07] <%bugz_munny> I didnt even know there was a book
[4:58:07] <willyfreshness> ITS MEMORABLE
[4:58:08] <+spartanghost004> you love it pat don't lie
[4:58:08] <+eldragon_1> Like a grandpa jog
[4:58:09] <+RyanTheRecluse> it's a good game
[4:58:10] <+athuramn> YEAH YOU DO
[4:58:14] <%Deft_Thought> Lass Effect living in your dome rent free
[4:58:18] <zenorot> shepard running is something you see way too often
[4:58:21] <+athuramn> also true
[4:58:23] <%Noir_Valdr> "nightmarishly bad third act" you mean the ending. Because ME3 is still a good game.
[4:58:24] <+spartanghost004> Andromeda did happen Pat
[4:58:27] <+Buzzkill983> If the Reapers were successful, that statue would've just been there for the next cycle, and people would be like, were these the kings?
[4:58:28] <+AmericanSkidd> DELAN
[4:58:28] <%valriot> The 3rd act isnt even bad, its just literally THE ending
[4:58:30] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh man just read a chess scrubquote didn't think it would happen
[4:58:31] <Manjove> i dont see how cop fantasy is a negative
[4:58:32] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god it's the preacher
[4:58:33] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Its a good game with cool lore
[4:58:35] <ralphfromdk> One of the best original universes made in a long time
[4:58:38] <%topendbuzza> face name
[4:58:38] <%AncelDeLambert> no, that's later, nvrmind
[4:58:39] <Goraka91> DYLAN
[4:58:42] <Guardiansaiyan> up everyone!
[4:58:43] <%captainpodock> same va as shep
[4:58:45] <+senfood> I want to date a hanar SO MUCH.
[4:58:47] <%X2Eliah> Honestly ME3 with all the DLC and stuff in this LE is pretty good
[4:58:47] <Mattais88> ME1 is super inspired by Star Trek, so it makes sense
[4:58:53] <%SirGO0SE> potionseller
[4:58:54] <+samiscoolbro> I hate how no one wants to talk about how the asari is the biggest extinction threat 2nd to reapers
[4:58:55] <%QueequegTheater> Nothing wrong with fantasy as long as it stays fantasy
[4:58:56] <manfredicus> You'll look like a psycho but if you pull out your gun You'll run faster
[4:58:56] <%dekkitout> Does Dylan sell potions?
[4:59:02] <Grandnatics> The blue glow is a lot LESS intense than the original
[4:59:03] <%X2Eliah> The dlc basically fixes a LOT of the problems people where whining about back then
[4:59:06] <ralphfromdk> Remember to get all the licenses LUL
[4:59:06] <+Buzzkill983> Marauder Shields and the Three Husketeers tried to keep us from ME3 ending
[4:59:07] <Manjove> @Mattais88 the other two, less so
[4:59:10] <+crazyspartan214> Krogan are the SWTOR version of the Mandalorian
[4:59:17] <+AmericanSkidd> Sick burn
[4:59:23] <TonberryLives> Fair
[4:59:27] <ralphfromdk> HAH... Hanar messed around with pronouns all the way back in 2007 :p
[4:59:29] <%dekkitout> Aw, that sounds nice
[4:59:30] <+DrSmashy> BLASTO
[4:59:31] <%Rumbutt> BLASTO
[4:59:32] <+athuramn> so they've been around since the protheans first arrived and were so bad at convincing people they were real that they got wiped out without ever being known?

[4:59:55] <dd44dostivei> blasto was voiced by phil hartman
[5:00:01] <%Taisuru> I wish Pat was Blasto...
[5:00:02] <+enigmaticgear> what do you think about each class in the game?
[5:00:05] <zenorot> So their warrior race he stupidly nuked their planet

[5:00:17] <%X2Eliah> equipment menu still sucks
[5:00:18] <Mattais88> @Buzzkill983 Nah, those are just based of the TNG movies, live insuurection and nemisis
[5:00:19] <%Monkeyweed21> the menus are still bad in ME1
[5:00:20] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[5:00:21] <+JaseAdrift> jeez why is the text so damn small

[5:00:23] <Justlaxy> I can't believe the hanar train assassins.
[5:00:23] <%Rumbutt> Pat, what if we had Mass Effect 4 and you played as BLASTO
[5:00:31] <%jillpilled> They barely changed the menus at all LUL

[5:04:47] <%yodaaz87> yodaaz87 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Pat, I’ve wondered this for a long time: what is your retirement plan?
[5:04:47] <+OG_M_Bison> You always get Garus
[5:04:47] <%AncelDeLambert> what no
[5:04:47] <Basch71> no
[5:04:48] <%Ranryu692> that sounds unlikely
[5:04:49] <+corybantic> waht no way
[5:04:49] <%Rumbutt> This means you get Wrex first
[5:04:50] <buhbuhboat> no
[5:04:50] <thebalticguy1> no
[5:04:50] <Sigma_190_Beta> I don't think so.
[5:04:50] <MagmaRam> I don't think you can lock anyone out?
[5:04:51] <dongy14> he's dumb
[5:04:51] <%BestTeaMaker> it super does not lock him out, what
[5:04:51] <Kizza360> no

[5:04:55] <rcand9> volus are the best, volus are the worst
[5:04:55] <%sporeian94> I could've sworn it does, garrus just hands out by the elevator until after you become a spectre
[5:04:57] <%X2Eliah> Picking up Tali before Garrus skips the medicine shootout
[5:04:57] <buhbuhboat> just means you get wrex before garrus
[5:04:58] <%Sweetangy021> No Zangief will hate Garrus cuz he's a cop
[5:04:59] <Case_Ah_Dia> one guy
[5:05:02] <Manjove> i think he meant Wrex?
[5:05:02] <Samurai_Tchan> chadowbroker
[5:05:02] <critiquequartz> No but it opens the path to skip him
[5:05:07] <%dekkitout> Does it affect companion affinity- if that's a thing?
[5:05:08] <pmaratsuper> No, but you should speak to Harkin before Wrex.
[5:05:22] <zenorot> no you can actually miss him. Only Tali and Wrex are required
[5:05:22] <Mattais88> Way to spy dude, just say it to any rando that wanders in off the street

[5:06:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oh, right. Krogans basically are black people to the law here.
[5:06:54] <SolaireSunbro> these guys creep me out
[5:07:11] <%dekkitout> No 🙃
[5:07:12] <Jaysky> Krogans are aggressive af though
[5:07:12] <Samurai_Tchan> galactic economic week event with barla von ,
[5:07:19] <%spoiledbadger> all that kitcoin gets out of control
[5:07:21] <zenorot> what do they look like without the mask?
[5:07:23] <%spoiledbadger> *bitcoin
[5:07:27] <Mattais88> Sounds pretty shady- about the SHADOW broker
[5:07:28] <thedragonofdandenong> I thought this channle only did dico elsyum finals what is this?
[5:07:30] <%SWFanatic> SWFanatic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! This is my favorite channel in the Twitch-a-del. Or something. Never stop punching reporters Commander.
[5:07:36] <Manjove> @Sigma_190_Beta in that you mean, "black people almost destroyed the nation and are now untrusted" you mean that kind of black?
[5:07:41] <%X2Eliah> man I can just imagine Woolie trying to play this and just *dying* at all this talking
[5:07:45] <Samurai_Tchan> @zenorot maybe like jar jar binks, no one knows
[5:07:46] <+AceNugget> the hidden hand of the space market
[5:07:48] <Manjove> cause that is what the Krogan did
[5:07:59] <+senfood> That is a GOOD LINE
[5:08:01] <Detrius25> LUL fake news

[5:09:55] <Manjove> @X2Eliah i know, Woolie is famous for hating when people are just talking
[5:10:02] <Jaysky> I made the mistake of not getting Ashley dead
[5:10:10] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I just realized something. How is there a GALACTIC STANDARD ECONOMY? What's the exchange rate for a human dollar to a space dollar? A standardized economy might just be THE most unrealistic thing about Mass Effect
[5:10:27] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I think Ashley gives a very good example of being a Christian who still believes in God even with a galaxy full of aliens, which is a viewpoint I wish was explored more in sci-fi...then she'll say shit like "I can't tell the aliens from the animals". NotLikeThis
[5:10:31] <%SWFanatic> kaidens nothing special but ashley is painful
[5:10:32] <+spacetitanium22> psaSkelmoney
[5:10:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @ScreamLord the Volan spent centuries figuring that out
[5:10:52] <Manjove> @ScreamLord :shrug: Volus are good with money.
[5:10:52] <+DrSmashy> @ScreamLord the volus are VERY good
[5:10:55] <dongy14> yeah ashley sucks so bad
[5:10:57] <%aBlueWizard> @ScreamLord they actually explain it in the codex
[5:11:03] <%MrBorisMakarov> @swfanatic he's just carth imo
[5:11:06] <metalliec> @SWFanatic but why did the krogans rebel
[5:11:20] <%topendbuzza> found all the keepers yet?
[5:11:22] <%SWFanatic> he is just carth
[5:11:23] <%TheFabledAble> the way you jog around is so comical to me
[5:11:24] <dongy14> same voice actor as Carth right?
[5:11:26] <+evbites> @metalliec because they could
[5:11:27] <%RageCasanova> Garus is at the clinic
[5:11:30] <+Mumbles519> I can't get over that run animation
[5:11:36] <+athuramn> @mrborismakarov oh my God you're alive. you gifted me a sub months ago, appreciate it 🙏
[5:11:39] <AthenaAegis> @dongy14 Yes
[5:11:44] <TheMadBadger> @ScreamLord Well to get there then humanity would have to have reached the stage where we see ourselves as one species as opposed to a bunch of different people from different bits of dirt. And that's that most unrealistic thing :P
[5:11:46] <Goraka91> @dongy14 Same personality even
[5:11:47] <%SWFanatic> @metalliec They like fighting stuff
[5:11:47] <%X2Eliah> Csec -> wards
[5:11:48] <%RageCasanova> fast travel leads to the wards lol
[5:12:01] <dongy14> atton>carth
[5:12:03] <%sporeian94> yes if I recall
[5:12:03] <+spartanghost004> yes
[5:12:04] <%Bt_Robot> C-Sec has another entry to the wards
[5:12:05] <pmaratsuper> Pretty much
[5:12:09] <+athuramn> I think so
[5:12:12] <%QueequegTheater> I think you have to meet Harkin first to unlock Wrex?
[5:12:16] <zenorot> you could originally save them both but Bioware changed that in development
[5:12:16] <%MrBorisMakarov> @athuramn lots of life changes but I'm still alive doodBro
[5:12:17] <+athuramn> it skips harkin
[5:12:18] <+spartanghost004> hard yes
[5:12:21] <%SWFanatic> Atton < Carth
[5:12:21] <Manjove> @QueequegTheater are you trying to tell me, that Christians are misrepresented in media as being "racists" when most aren't?!
[5:12:22] <%X2Eliah> Either talking to wrex, or the next step (shootout)
[5:12:28] <Jaysky> Didn't the krogans rebel cause they killed the rachni and then she figured they were so strong they could beat anyone, so then they got neutered?
[5:12:33] <+AmericanSkidd> no, he hangs out through the game i think
[5:12:35] <metalliec> @PatStaresAt did you win?
[5:12:35] <KaitlynnHere> Does anyone remember the carth chart?
[5:12:36] <Jaysky> *then they
[5:12:38] <+liquidzr0> SourPls
[5:12:42] <+spartanghost004> you can just go get wrex right now
[5:12:48] <+spartanghost004> he leads you to garrus
[5:12:51] <+evbites> @ScreamLord i dunno racism based on color goes away when a bone-white orange eyed demon walks down the street
[5:12:54] <tranquilturnip> you like the space white aesthetic
[5:13:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> scan da keepo
[5:13:13] <Goraka91> @Jaysky They live long and have massive litters, they had a population problem and instead of asking just took nearby planets that were already inhabited

[5:14:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> atpRtsd
[5:14:57] <%Sweetangy021> Melee is never the answer in this game
[5:14:57] <yojohny> Interesting
[5:14:59] <+AmericanSkidd> Dont feel too bad, they got me too
[5:15:01] <+athuramn> but the shotgun best gun
[5:15:02] <Mattais88> Cirtical mission failure
[5:15:02] <ScreamLord> And that's why Vangaurd get a charge in ME2
[5:15:03] <+BeardedGhost0_0> FeelsSnowyMan
[5:15:03] <%TheFabledAble> the way your character ragdolls looks so pathetic
[5:15:04] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat the GUN goes BANG
[5:15:04] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[5:15:05] <+DrSmashy> vanguard is the best class, but not in ME 1
[5:15:06] <+spartanghost004> oh right the saren theme is the death theme

[5:15:07] <yojohny> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[5:15:08] <+Buzzkill983> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[5:15:09] <%BoxNavy> he die
[5:15:10] <%Deft_Thought> I forget: is the reason you're able to just discharge weapons in this sector of the citadel because its "out of bounds" for C-Sec?
[5:15:11] <Mattais88> I've never seen that screen before
[5:15:12] <%RageCasanova> Turians don't give a fuck about melee for reasons
[5:15:12] <xcompleasedad> Melee SUCKS before 3
[5:15:16] <jorniev> what class is he playing as?
[5:15:20] <+flexin_apex> Easy mode now available
[5:15:21] <KaitlynnHere> Is that zangeif snoring?
[5:15:25] <%Bt_Robot> And that's why soldier is the best class
[5:15:27] <%X2Eliah> vanguard
[5:15:38] <Manjove> @xcompleasedad hell, it sucks in 3 too
[5:15:45] <jorniev> thats the one with the mass ffect powers?
[5:15:45] <Jaysky> Where are my NPC shouts of ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[5:15:48] <+evbites> soldier best class
[5:15:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> stop it pat
[5:15:49] <+AmericanSkidd> Club dont give a fuck
[5:15:51] <%X2Eliah> Honestly ME1 combat is pretty gun-biased
[5:15:52] <Goraka91> They cannot stop your flood or bad decisions
[5:15:53] <Ids560> it won't be the last time
[5:15:54] <+JaseAdrift> cause you all hate each other
[5:15:56] <wasdsf> the curvable biotics in 2 and 3 are so much better
[5:15:57] <faithless_zealot> LUL, how come you ran right at them without firing your gun
[5:15:57] <%Monkeyweed21> DANCe
[5:16:00] <+spartanghost004> so you learn about hatred
[5:16:01] <ketchuo13> Soldier is fun in 1 and 3
[5:16:02] <yojohny> Vanguard was such a joke in ME1
[5:16:04] <spuginky> impossible
[5:16:05] <metalliec> @PatStaresAt SIT DOWN
[5:16:06] <%sporeian94> THERE'S THE 13 YEAR OLD MASTURBATIION CHAIR

[5:16:08] <+OG_M_Bison> @xcompleasedad @Manjove You clearly didn't play the Krogan Warlord in multiplayer then LUL
[5:16:08] <%BoxNavy> wow this place sucks
[5:16:09] <%TheFabledAble> stelile is the new sexy in the space future
[5:16:09] <+JaseAdrift> pg 13 strip club
[5:16:11] <Parapattern> PG13 Strip Club
[5:16:11] <dongy14> the geth juggernaut in multiplayer had great melee
[5:16:11] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[5:16:12] <BinaryShuffle> they aren't just space racist, they are just racist against gingers
[5:16:13] <ScreamLord> Biotics are fucking awful in ME1. Throw and Lift were the only ones that seemed worth a damn
[5:16:14] <feralspidey> wouldn't be an rpg if the party members didn't revive the main character...
[5:16:16] <Mattais88> Strip clubs need to be sterile
[5:16:17] <DodgeJohnson> Because there's not much you can do for someone who threw themselves onto the barrel of a shotgun
[5:16:18] <xcompleasedad> @Manjove BUT, if you are an Infiltrator, you can get some sick executions
[5:16:21] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[5:16:22] <zenorot> soldier is probably the best class

[5:16:51] <+evbites> @sporeian94 oh how far we've co...adavanced
[5:16:54] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt I imagine any space where multiple alien races like to get horny you would want to keep it sterile AF to keep insane diseases from hopping species
[5:16:56] <Manjove> @xcompleasedad y'know, i dont actually like the Omniblade that much
[5:16:56] <dongy14> @Reveresao soon brother
[5:17:02] <Jaysky> @WyvernOfMews I can somehow picture Shepard saying this in my head like it's natural
[5:17:06] <MarylandJutsu> if you're femshep he hits on you very skeezy
[5:17:08] <KaitlynnHere> @dd44dostivei lmao good one

[5:18:16] <+LightLifter> Is Pat going full Patagrade?
[5:18:19] <%SWFanatic> Fuck saving the galaxy, lets talk about space herpes
[5:18:22] <+AmericanSkidd> The Femshep version of this is so much worse
[5:18:23] <+MrILikeSpam> Hard
[5:18:24] <+LightLifter> I hope its ParaPat
[5:18:25] <zenorot> you literally look the same
[5:18:30] <Manjove> i can at least appreciate how honest he is
[5:18:36] <dongy14> i want femboi shep
[5:18:40] <KaitlynnHere> I’m sure they have a cure for herpes in space
[5:18:44] <%logoth_> If he's so smart how come he's dead
[5:18:45] <+Buzzkill983> Anderson is actually the second best hero after Shep
[5:18:45] <+evbites> @MrILikeSpam and you can renegade him  harder
[5:18:46] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt The dialogue is a little low, imo
[5:18:58] <Dunmarkh> why did the secret police kick this hero out?
[5:18:59] <%SWFanatic> @AmericanSkidd You're right. I forgot how cringey it was until you reminded me.
[5:19:02] <dongy14> @KaitlynnHere they still have cancer tho
[5:19:03] <%topendbuzza> lol
[5:19:04] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Oh god your Shep is literally just Harkin with moustache
[5:19:11] <$ComfortableStranger> harkin and saren have a hate boner for Anderson
[5:19:13] <+DrSmashy> the worst possible fate

[5:19:26] <%mr_whet_faartz> oh like a job
[5:19:28] <%SWFanatic> @X2Eliah Pat = Harkin ?
[5:19:35] <%AncelDeLambert> what a loser
[5:19:40] <zenorot> harkin is your long lost brother
[5:19:41] <%WyvernOfMews> @dongy14 I think everyone wants femboi Shep, NPCs and players
[5:19:42] <+athuramn> it's like Shephard is staring at his futue
[5:19:43] <%AncelDeLambert> "Yeah I stole, I'm a cop so what?"
[5:19:51] <Samurai_Tchan> HE looks like you
[5:19:52] <Bail_Seven> what a hero
[5:19:54] <+AmericanSkidd> what a crybaby
[5:20:00] <KaitlynnHere> @dongy14 cancer is different though. There’s like what, four varieties of herpes. Cancer, there’s several.
[5:20:18] <%SWFanatic> "Garrus is hot" thats all I heard

[5:21:39] <%Nekros4442> yeyeyeye
[5:21:40] <kago_dev> Kappa What about Ashley?
[5:21:40] <Goraka91> I will also accept Wrex and Garrus
[5:21:41] <%Noir_Valdr> no Garrus huh
[5:21:42] <%Rumbutt> That is the best party
[5:21:42] <jorniev> the people you actually like
[5:21:43] <ScrubTheNerd> Pretty good gang
[5:21:43] <%Noir_Valdr> rip
[5:21:46] <%BigCoffee> not using garruas?
[5:21:46] <xcompleasedad> What about tali and Garrus?
[5:21:47] <+RealMichaelPhelps> tali is my little quarian can opener
[5:21:48] <%Bt_Robot> BUT THE FAN
[5:21:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> I love that everyone I've watched runs a different party
[5:21:51] <Broken_Sonex> WHAT ABOUT GARRUS
[5:21:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Tali/Garrus?
[5:21:52] <darkodargon> Whats up gamers
[5:21:52] <%Taisuru> I wish you could have another for Garus
[5:21:57] <%X2Eliah> tali and garrus is good
[5:21:57] <Goraka91> Wrex is mandatory
[5:21:58] <CatRidder> garrus and garrus?
[5:21:59] <%bassoontyphoon> The not human gang
[5:21:59] <%MrBorisMakarov> I will accept garrus and tali
[5:21:59] <+corybantic> always wrex
[5:22:00] <%scaryboisupreme> Just alternate them out
[5:22:01] <%QueequegTheater> "Can't court martial me if I shoot the court"
[5:22:01] <%cvp5127> just no humans
[5:22:02] <%scaryboisupreme> Ew Liara
[5:22:03] <+evbites> the main point of specters is to be the crooked cops
[5:22:03] <%bread_assassin> Tali, Wrex, and a Vanguard would be a perfectly balanced party.
[5:22:03] <stormhawk9891> Or Wrex and Wrex
[5:22:05] <logothete2401> This is the correct opinion
[5:22:06] <KaitlynnHere> @kago_dev she’s the best one Kappa
[5:22:06] <Broken_Sonex> There you go
[5:22:07] <+vicar_anat> Or Wrex and Wrex
[5:22:07] <%CatastropheCorvid> Or Wrex and Wrex?
[5:22:08] <+coolthulhuu> just anyone but these two nerds
[5:22:11] <aiutare47> Tali and garrus are the best party
[5:22:12] <%Deft_Thought> #getthesefuckinghumansoutofmyparty
[5:22:12] <Profmcstevie> or.... two wrexes somehow
[5:22:12] <+DrSmashy> what about the dextro squad?
[5:22:12] <MissCutter> I love this music
[5:22:13] <%RageCasanova> there is an interaction in the bar with Wrex and the other Krogan... not sure why it didn't play lol
[5:22:13] <wasdsf> wabbout tali
[5:22:13] <%MidnightBurst12> Wrex and Wrex?
[5:22:13] <%scaryboisupreme> Liara is basically human
[5:22:14] <Samurai_Tchan> liara is a jedi in this
[5:22:14] <BrianDLahey> Wrex Garrus for life
[5:22:16] <yojohny> Or Liara and Tali
[5:22:17] <+AmericanSkidd> He knows what he's doing
[5:22:18] <wasdsf> lol
[5:22:22] <MissCutter> damn i want this game so bad
[5:22:24] <jorniev> MAN i love legions so much i hope we get a cool geth companion next game
[5:22:24] <%TheFabledAble> tali and garrus was my group <3

[5:22:27] <+Peacefrog7> tali and wrex were always my go to
[5:22:27] <+AceNugget> wrex shepard wrex
[5:22:28] <+ScottishMadJacko> wrex gets one game, you can be damn sure he gets in the squad
[5:22:28] <+senfood> The only reason i even remember Ashley exists is because she's a racist asshole. I'm trying to type the other guy's name right now but I can't because I forgot.
[5:22:28] <%TheFabledAble> love my sassy aliens
[5:22:29] <%Taisuru> They suck so much
[5:22:33] <%BestTeaMaker> best 3 group
[5:22:36] <%X2Eliah> xD
[5:22:40] <Goraka91> They fuck
[5:22:40] <%QueequegTheater> "We'll bang, okay"
[5:22:40] <%sporeian94> if only you knew
[5:22:43] <Bail_Seven> LUL
[5:22:43] <Grandnatics> Getting Liara after every other party member and planet gives you a whole different interaction when you go and get her
[5:22:45] <ScreamLord> One is boring and racist, while the other is Carth
[5:22:46] <+KuwabaraSession> don't ingest it
[5:22:46] <+evbites> oh hell yeah

[5:22:51] <ape_hawk> garrus only has one corkscrew penis
[5:22:54] <%dekkitout> Wasn't paying attention- did he say Garrus has drip?
[5:22:54] <zenorot> which human party member is actually good?
[5:22:57] <MissCutter> I hate ashley :s
[5:22:57] <yojohny> Where's that threesome anyway?
[5:22:57] <+DrSmashy> WORTH
[5:22:57] <%cvp5127> and?
[5:22:57] <aiutare47> That’s the point.
[5:22:58] <%QueequegTheater> WORTH

[5:23:37] <SaltyAzteca> GARRUUUUUS
[5:23:39] <+Peacefrog7> wait does that happen if you romance tali or garrus
[5:23:40] <Goraka91> @jorniev Reaper slave race like Collectors, they don't control them directly though so they're mostly harmless
[5:23:40] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I mean, post ME2 Shep is probably resilient enough to survive it
[5:23:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Garrus has had it up to his mandibles with this bs
[5:23:44] <%scaryboisupreme> Garrus is a psychopath you gotta ring in
[5:23:45] <%RageCasanova> sometimes you have the shot.  and you take it
[5:23:45] <+flexin_apex> Nice shot
[5:23:46] <KaitlynnHere> It’s tali that could die from the banging
[5:23:46] <jorniev> he really loves being THE PUNISHER
[5:23:46] <Samurai_Tchan> YEH you picked a biotic
[5:23:46] <%AncelDeLambert> nice aim, Pat
[5:23:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> lmao the physics in this are hilarious

[5:24:02] <yojohny> Throw a useless grenage
[5:24:03] <%animaturgy> kneecap = evaporated
[5:24:06] <Manjove> its crazy how Chat flips on cops as soon as one they like shows up...
[5:24:07] <%bugz_munny> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[5:24:09] <%TheFabledAble> eh xD
[5:24:10] <KaitlynnHere> And garrus just has a barbed penis
[5:24:11] <aiutare47> @peacefrog7 no. It’s if you do neither then walk in on them at the very end.

[5:24:29] <NetherTable> stop resisting
[5:24:29] <+evbites> @scaryboisupreme "he removed the stick up his ass and beats people to death with it"
[5:24:31] <Goraka91> @jorniev Yes
[5:24:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> The key difference about this cop is that Shepard isn't real
[5:24:38] <%TheFabledAble> Garrus is young and gunho, he hasnt been corrupted by the cop bug yet
[5:24:41] <%QueequegTheater> HE WAS COMIN RIGHT FOR ME
[5:24:45] <%scaryboisupreme> REFORM THAT COP
[5:24:47] <Samurai_Tchan> dont be mean to garrus
[5:24:52] <%X2Eliah> Garrus is a literal sniper, he don't miss
[5:24:52] <MissCutter> damn thath textures looks fine
[5:24:52] <+DarkOnyx7> Biotics are so much fun in ME1, just CC enemies forever LUL

[5:25:06] <+evbites> @TheFabledAble he isn't judge dread yet
[5:25:07] <%TheFabledAble> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[5:25:11] <%X2Eliah> EW A QUARIAN
[5:25:11] <zenorot> Garrus's development in ME2 is so contrary to ME1
[5:25:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> has there ever been a quarian spectre?
[5:25:19] <%TheFabledAble> exactly
[5:25:22] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt A bit of BioWare not knowing what they're talking about. Levo Amino Acid based stuff usually WON'T instantly put you into toxic/Anaphylactic shock. Usually your body will completely ignore it and it'll go straight through your system with no ill effects
[5:25:22] <wasdsf> shadow borkers
[5:25:23] <Daniel_Is_I> I would not have said she's got a French accent.
[5:25:25] <jorniev> manic pixie tali
[5:25:27] <%za7az> psaDogchamp
[5:25:28] <Goraka91> So Pat you're the master, is she French French, Quebecois French, or Fake French?
[5:25:28] <MissCutter> She looks older here
[5:25:28] <%blutzwavedave> Hey she talks like Pat!
[5:25:32] <$ComfortableStranger> "harden" garrus
[5:25:34] <%Bt_Robot> This is one of those wierd things about Bioware games.  They are the only ones with French Canadian voice actors
[5:25:34] <%Deft_Thought> Wouldn't Shephard get into deep shit if any other member of C-Sec found out he'd gotten into two gun fights?
[5:25:36] <%SWFanatic> so even in the remake they still have plastic short hair models
[5:25:37] <+AmericanSkidd> He's a bone broker
[5:25:43] <DrStinkers> Bork Brokers Ltd
[5:25:45] <+Peacefrog7> yeah she does look older
[5:25:48] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Shadow borker
[5:25:48] <%scaryboisupreme> @ScreamLord so my shep can bang garrus all they want
[5:25:51] <%dekkitout> The Shadow Borker, the Swedish Chef's nemesis

[5:26:21] <Goraka91> @ScreamLord So you're saying it's possible...

[5:28:10] <%X2Eliah> NO DECRYPTION AND ELECTRONICS IS TALI
[5:28:12] <%RageCasanova> IT'S HACKING SKILL
[5:28:12] <yojohny> God damn they dumbed this shit down in the other games
[5:28:12] <+OPJeffers> very important to open locked shit
[5:28:14] <+evbites> enimes can't shoot
[5:28:15] <%Sweetangy021> It let's you open chest you otherwise couldn't
[5:28:15] <Jaysky> @wasdsf What helmet?
[5:28:15] <Grandnatics> Sabotage kills shields
[5:28:15] <%sporeian94> electronics also helps with salvage
[5:28:17] <%AncelDeLambert> to open doors, Pat
[5:28:17] <Ids560> I forget, are there any turian biotics in the 3 games?
[5:28:17] <+ScottishMadJacko> they're needed to unlock containers
[5:28:18] <%topendbuzza> loot
[5:28:18] <%Monkeyweed21> always level support skills on your party @PatStaresAt
[5:28:18] <%logoth_> Advanced Damping, that one's for the ladies
[5:28:18] <@StridentSong> It really depending on your team
[5:28:18] <lloyddboy> HACKERMAN
[5:28:19] <MissCutter> I never use it
[5:28:19] <Grandnatics> Kills shields
[5:28:21] <Irishgamerlawd> just what I needed nooooice
[5:28:23] <buhbuhboat> lets you get more loot
[5:28:23] <+D00msDayDan> they can unlock shit for you if they're in your party
[5:28:24] <%X2Eliah> TALI CAN DO IT ALL
[5:28:24] <%sporeian94> They stack
[5:28:24] <%snow_bush> NEED HACK
[5:28:25] <%RageCasanova> PICK ONE
[5:28:26] <Samurai_Tchan> points on WEAPONS
[5:28:29] <+JaseAdrift> HACKER SQUAD
[5:28:30] <Basch71> whoever has the highest then
[5:28:30] <+Peacefrog7> crates and loot
[5:28:30] <+evbites> it's busted
[5:28:31] <%AncelDeLambert> just do his Agent levels
[5:28:31] <%Sweetangy021> One of them needs it the other doesn't
[5:28:31] <Grandnatics> Both of them DESTROY Geth
[5:28:32] <+ScottishMadJacko> tali can do it too
[5:28:33] <%JoshManVGH> Double lockpick
[5:28:34] <@StridentSong> Tali can do both Decrypt and Electronics
[5:28:35] <Broken_Sonex> HACKER BIRD MAN
[5:28:35] <%evilmagetim> Lockpick
[5:28:36] <dd44dostivei> are you going to take tali on every mission?
[5:28:39] <+AFellowDegen> they branch off to two different sub paths after
[5:28:40] <+Belasteris> Tali is a full ROgues, Garrus is Hybrid Rogue/Fighter
[5:28:40] <+DarkOnyx7> Tali is an unlocking goddess with max decryption and electronics
[5:28:40] <%MrBorisMakarov> GUN GO UP
[5:28:41] <+Peacefrog7> doesnt stack
[5:28:44] <+evbites> it's great
[5:28:44] <%Bt_Robot> You want him on decryption and electronics makes things so much easier
[5:28:45] <buhbuhboat> it also gives sabotage which is a good combat ability as well
[5:28:46] <+AFellowDegen> aleays do support skills
[5:28:48] <wasdsf> @wasdsf it was on screen for like 1 second, garrus gets cool helmets
[5:28:50] <Samurai_Tchan> POINTS ON ATTACK
[5:28:51] <%evilmagetim> Tali and wrex
[5:28:52] <%bread_assassin> They don't stack. ONE needs master decryption and electronics.
[5:28:54] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt If you have Tali with decrypo and electronics, you dont need those skills on nayone else
[5:29:01] <%Monkeyweed21> you are the primary damage dealer for your team
[5:29:01] <%Sweetangy021> One of them needs to be able to fix the Mako as well
[5:29:02] <%RageCasanova> Hack is support
[5:29:03] <@StridentSong> I build Garrus hard into Sniper, Turian and Tactical usually
[5:29:03] <+ScottishMadJacko> you just need one with master of electronics and decryption on team at times pretty much
[5:29:06] <Samurai_Tchan> decryption is for helping you open locks
[5:29:10] <%RageCasanova> decrypt is supporty
[5:29:17] <+evbites> turian agent
[5:29:18] <gralho> garrrus is ur best bro at mass effect 3...
[5:29:20] <Grandnatics> If you're going Garrus + Tali, Garrus can go full into guns
[5:29:21] <+enigmaticgear> Tali is best girl
[5:29:34] <Parapattern> Tactical Turtle Neck Garrus
[5:29:37] <Kidbizzaro> This is true
[5:29:38] <+Peacefrog7> shield boost is big
[5:29:39] <Detrius25> lucidWeb Hacker Squad
[5:29:39] <%Bt_Robot> Sniper
[5:29:48] <+ThunderZebraKing> I always hated the way the game auto skilled
[5:29:48] <%RageCasanova> you runnin Tali? then go ahead lol
[5:29:53] <+athuramn> @enigmaticgear you speak a beautiful truth
[5:29:53] <Samurai_Tchan> YOU WILL NEED HIS SNIPER THING
[5:29:55] <%Taisuru> He's clearly a sniper though
[5:29:59] <+evbites> they are
[5:30:01] <%dekkitout> @Parapattern Please, they're called tactile necks
[5:30:03] <Laecerelius> I always go Garrus/Wrex in ME1
[5:30:04] <Basch71> I had legendary mode on and by the end, everyone was pretty much decked out only using auto
[5:30:04] <Jaysky> Shepard.
[5:30:10] <Samurai_Tchan> add the sniper points
[5:30:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Tali is... shotgun and pistol, I think
[5:30:15] <+Buzzkill983> Scoped and DROPPED
[5:30:16] <+neonNeptunian> Wrex.
[5:30:20] <%Bt_Robot> First Aid is a garbage skill
[5:30:35] <%sporeian94> you need ashley and kaiden in the party
[5:30:39] <MissCutter> Im sad, i cant buy this game
[5:30:39] <+AmericanSkidd> you need the humans

[5:34:37] <%evilmagetim> !Very important! When you become a Specter make a save before talking to the csec shopkeeper. He glitches out and won’t sell the specter weapons, but you can fix it by talking to him in the old save.
[5:34:37] <ARobotFromtheFuture1> The guys

[5:35:02] <+senfood> oh my god LUL
[5:35:04] <ape_hawk> yeah, you can tell by the krogan's eyes that they are prey, not predators, on their home planet
[5:35:05] <Samurai_Tchan> LIARA IS GODLIKE powerfull too
[5:35:09] <aiutare47> SUCH A GOOD LINE
[5:35:13] <ahaegotrigger> fucking Amazing
[5:35:14] <Mattais88> You would have it too living on a place full of thresher maws
[5:35:16] <MagmaRam> Krogans are BAD MOTHERFUCKERS one and all
[5:35:18] <+AmericanSkidd> Big Brain Time
[5:35:19] <dd44dostivei> THE KROGAN SPLIT THE ATOM

[5:35:25] <%blutzwavedave> W A R C R I M E S
[5:35:26] <%X2Eliah> Uplifting a specias that almost nuked themselves into extinction is not a good idea
[5:35:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Krogans were basically still hanging out like Ganghis Khan when they got spaceships
[5:35:33] <%Bt_Robot> MY QUAD!
[5:35:34] <+evbites> we built a race up then kicked them down
[5:35:35] <+senfood> THEY'RE JUST SUPER, WEIRD HUMANS
[5:35:38] <%dekkitout> THEY WHAT
[5:35:41] <balthazar758> Krogan Fallout. Literally.
[5:35:42] <Mattais88> Oh god whats a HD thresher may looo like
[5:35:44] <%scaryboisupreme> Oh no
[5:35:47] <MagmaRam> @X2Eliah On the contrary, it's what we in the industry call a REALLY GOOD IDEA
[5:35:50] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Krogans mandalore’d their planet
[5:35:50] <%dekkitout> D:
[5:35:51] <+D00msDayDan> SPACE GENOCIDE
[5:35:51] <%sporeian94> "Yeah but it was a justifiable genocide!"
[5:35:53] <%X2Eliah> So yeah, Krogan started to conquer already inhabited worlds
[5:35:53] <+evbites> @AncelDeLambert except with nukes
[5:35:54] <%Da_Big_Mac> B I O W E A P O N
[5:35:54] <jorniev> why didnt you use the genophage on the rachni?
[5:35:57] <%scaryboisupreme> Oh man my donation messages will be SO poorly timed
[5:35:57] <+ChaosAethr> BIG OOOF
[5:35:57] <%TheMattman1313> Time to fuck 1000X more!
[5:35:57] <%dekkitout> That is pretty fair
[5:35:58] <%Bt_Robot> SHEPERD, MY QUAD!
[5:35:58] <ahaegotrigger> they hate both LUL
[5:36:05] <+Buzzkill983> I would be madder at the Salarians myself
[5:36:05] <jorniev> creeepy guys
[5:36:06] <+AmericanSkidd> They hate everybody
[5:36:07] <%bugz_munny> Turians deployed it I think
[5:36:10] <jorniev> CREEEPY FUCKS
[5:36:12] <%DJFakie> DJFakie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! I will never have enough of your snide insinuations, or disingenuous assertions. Thanks, Pat!
[5:36:13] <zenorot> and then they put a statute of them in the citadel
[5:36:13] <+yunngin> im not sertain if it's understood at this point that the solarions are the ones who did it
[5:36:15] <ralphfromdk> I mean... do you hate the guy that build a gun, or the guy that shot you with said gun?
[5:36:16] <ahaegotrigger> SHEPARD HOWS THE QUADS
[5:36:16] <+evbites> it was a turian order
[5:36:17] <%Rumbutt> You're gonna be more mad at the people who pulled the trigger than the ones that made the gun, even if you hate them both
[5:36:33] <+GuilKato> see if it didnt make them miscarry its a fine solution - if its just wow you only have a kid every thousand times you bang (and they have long lives)
[5:36:36] <%scaryboisupreme> Salarians made it, then they retcon it to that the turians just shot them and the salarians deployed it TWICE
[5:36:38] <+evbites> reaper dogs
[5:36:39] <jorniev> how do krogan feel about humans?
[5:36:41] <Goraka91> @jorniev It only works on Krogan because it was designed specifically to work on Krogan, it wasn't a pre-existing bioweapon
[5:36:41] <%dekkitout> Keepers are friend-shaped ?
[5:36:45] <Manjove> @yunngin it literally said "salarian engineered bioweapon
[5:36:47] <muXPerience> it comes from stork
[5:36:50] <xcompleasedad> Why the fuck is no-one tracking these things????
[5:36:50] <ahaegotrigger> what
[5:36:54] <%MrBorisMakarov> they age????
[5:36:56] <quigley_plays> My favorite bit of world building is the advertisment for black market krogan testicle, for 10k credits each, or 40k for a whole set.
[5:36:57] <xcompleasedad> Like, officially
[5:36:58] <ape_hawk> keepers are just space janitors
[5:37:03] <illtima> This is still the weirdest part. Like no one actually investigated the Citadel??
[5:37:03] <+evbites> @xcompleasedad too many
[5:37:05] <%MrBorisMakarov> I NEVER READ THAT WHAAAT
[5:37:07] <%SWFanatic> Hanar space opera
[5:37:09] <+yunngin> god the Codead is so goooood like why doesnt every game have this
[5:37:11] <%bugz_munny> canadians
[5:37:12] <Manjove> the Hanar are literal Grammar Nazis
[5:37:12] <ahaegotrigger> the citadel has an inacessable core and they just live on this thing?
[5:37:13] <jorniev> @Goraka91 no i mean why didnt they use a bio weapon on the rachni?
[5:37:13] <pmaratsuper> Man the keeper lore is so cool.
[5:37:15] <+senfood> Why are the hanar so moe?
[5:37:15] <+yunngin> codex*
[5:37:19] <AmuserName> Please address me as Hanar-Sama, not Hanar-San.
[5:37:20] <ahaegotrigger> thats brave
[5:37:22] <Samurai_Tchan> WE NEED REAL LIFE KEEPERS to help our society
[5:37:26] <%dumemoto> Literal Space Canadians
[5:37:32] <Goraka91> @jorniev idk maybe they tried and it didn't work
[5:37:38] <MagmaRam> @Manjove More of a Grammar Inquisition, apparently.

[5:39:18] <%dekkitout> Drive fast, eat ass. This is the Salarian way.
[5:39:18] <ianabstract> The Quarians get taught about the War of Geth Agression and how it was fought for Quarian Rights
[5:39:19] <Manjove> @QueequegTheater there is no such thing as an "unreasonably Thicc Quarian my guy

[5:58:14] <+GuilKato> his combat armor needs to get high enough to wear heavy armor @PatStaresAt I think in combat armor
[5:58:15] <huskarl_zap> SWOLE
[5:58:21] <%Bt_Robot> SHOTGUNS COMBAT ARMOR FITNESS
[5:58:31] <Samurai_Tchan> weapons  are the best
[5:58:35] <%AzureGale> Didn't they nerf Immunity in Legendary Edition?
[5:58:40] <CrypticMochi> Immunity is busted
[5:58:40] <Hellarussian> we do it
[5:58:42] <$hattrick61> Get wrex to heavy armor
[5:58:48] <%RageCasanova> Combat Armor also builds into HEAVY ARMOR for Wrex
[5:58:49] <DodgeJohnson> I'd put at least 1 into Battlemaster for health regen
[5:58:50] <%Monkeyweed21> yea thats good
[5:58:52] <%SWFanatic> toggle helmet?
[5:59:02] <buhbuhboat> In the original game you could have unending immunity on soldier shepard
[5:59:05] <%bevyrage> immunity use to also affect shield damage, the nerf was a bug
[5:59:06] <+robosqueeb> wow 75% dr
[5:59:06] <Archmortal> they did not nerf it in ME1, it's still busted
[5:59:11] <%bevyrage> *fixing a bug
[5:59:12] <+robosqueeb> good shit
[5:59:15] <%RageCasanova> Battle Master is also good
[5:59:16] <Hellarussian> damage sponge
[5:59:25] <Manjove> i hate how ME2 &3 dont have toggle helmet
[5:59:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> Not enough though.
[5:59:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> At least in the original.
[5:59:37] <BrianDLahey> Reverse. Combat armor first
[5:59:37] <$hattrick61> Yeah im almost maxed and im not even half way
[5:59:37] <%RageCasanova> yeah you'll basically be able to max out everything
[5:59:39] <Manjove> i dont like looking at faces
[5:59:41] <Mattais88> Nothing says 'fuck you combat" like in action healing
[5:59:46] <+corybantic> yes
[5:59:49] <dd44dostivei> decryption too
[5:59:52] <+ScottishMadJacko> electronics and decryption
[5:59:53] <%RageCasanova> both electronics and decryption
[5:59:56] <%Sweetangy021> Decrytion for chest electronics for Mako
[6:00:01] <$hattrick61> You need both decryption and electronics
[6:00:07] <%RageCasanova> decryption also
[6:00:13] <+reinbachthe3rd> Garrus is my boy.
[6:00:13] <%RageCasanova> there are 2 types of chests
[6:00:16] <+AmericanSkidd> you can save those for tali
[6:00:27] <Hellarussian> thats correct
[6:00:28] <Justlaxy> I didn't know I needed stat for chest so I skipped most loot in the game.
[6:00:31] <%RageCasanova> yee
[6:00:32] <Samurai_Tchan> who cares about decryption ,
[6:00:33] <%Monkeyweed21> first aid is good
[6:00:33] <Dunmarkh> yeah probably
[6:00:35] <+ScottishMadJacko> couldn't hurt
[6:00:36] <+SataruYamate> i make tali the decrypt and electro bot
[6:00:36] <DodgeJohnson> Decryption for crates, electronics for Mako and planetary relics
[6:00:41] <Samurai_Tchan> hee needs sniper
[6:00:46] <%bassoontyphoon> VoteYea
[6:00:49] <%RageCasanova> eventually you'll want tactical armor as well to get medium armor yee
[6:00:52] <Archmortal> still better to unlock electronics, just prepare to put the last pip in
[6:01:01] <Samurai_Tchan> in combat you will want snipers
[6:01:01] <%Sweetangy021> Are you gonna go Garrus/Tali or Garrus/Wrex?
[6:01:09] <%Bt_Robot> Garrus should be a glass cannon
[6:01:29] <%king_wragles> @Sweetangy021 He's already said Tali+Wrex
[6:01:34] <%Ascethetic> @Sweetangy021 Wrex/Tali
[6:01:34] <%RageCasanova> decryption for quality of life
[6:01:54] <%Bt_Robot> You point him at tough enemies and the Sniper skill takes them out
[6:01:57] <%Sweetangy021> Oh then Gun it up as Garrus
[6:02:03] <Hellarussian> his kit is pretty straightforward
[6:02:22] <xcompleasedad> Madness
[6:02:24] <%RageCasanova> hell mid game you'll have so many damn points you can bring anyone
[6:02:32] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Garrus, Liara and Wrex, Tali.
[6:02:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> god inventory management in this is a nightmare

[6:03:17] <Mattais88> inventory is huge part of me 1 before 2 starts being all shoot bangs
[6:03:20] <balthazar758> tiffosSIN
[6:03:21] <+ScottishMadJacko> yeah, woo
[6:03:21] <huskarl_zap> Asari in disguise?
[6:03:28] <tegas_> excuse me?
[6:03:32] <%RageCasanova> they're real good on higher difficulties
[6:03:38] <mar_krow> ?
[6:03:44] <jorniev> I wish they had done something with the menus for the re-release
[6:03:46] <+JaseAdrift> lotta red dots
[6:03:53] <%Taisuru> Garrus gives no fucks
[6:03:58] <%bassoontyphoon> “Let’s get in there and suck some dick” me at the gay bars when they’re open
[6:04:02] <zenorot> is the inventory atl east better than  andromeda
[6:04:03] <+AmericanSkidd> Kill them all Shepard
[6:04:22] <%scaryboisupreme> FUCK YEAH DUE PROCESS
[6:04:30] <buhbuhboat> what difficulty is this cause i feel like they definetly made me1 easier?
[6:04:35] <ahaegotrigger> nice
[6:04:45] <+GuilKato> have you set your friendos to use all their powers automatically
[6:04:53] <Javi9563> you level up way faster in the remaster, it's crazy
[6:04:57] <+BlockingDisabled> Are pistols still super OP in this game?
[6:04:59] <%Sweetangy021> Krogan's always passively regenerate health
[6:05:10] <+Higure_yoru> Why they healing so fast?
[6:05:12] <Basch71> jesus shotgun deletes
[6:05:15] <Hellarussian> how can it be
[6:05:16] <Minorou> he was a ghost. a space ghost.
[6:05:24] <+ScottishMadJacko> he'll be back
[6:05:38] <%bassoontyphoon> Don’t forget to get the info for Wong
[6:05:46] <$hattrick61> @blockingdisabled no, they changed marksman so it increases damage and accuracy instead of rate of fire
[6:05:50] <jay521> well that was easy
[6:05:55] <Onamar> Shooting takes half a second
[6:06:00] <%RageCasanova> no words shepard
[6:06:00] <%scaryboisupreme> That's really out of character for Garrus
[6:06:01] <Zebroneath> Garrus, even you don't beleive that
[6:06:02] <+JaseAdrift> lmao wrex wants big murder
[6:06:03] <%afronooch> i love the turn and walk away animation so much
[6:06:03] <Jaysky> Bullets too slow
[6:06:03] <%RageCasanova> only shotgun
[6:06:04] <SomeAsianDood> Fist was a shit boss
[6:06:06] <stantheman_97> krogans love murder, man
[6:06:07] <Parapattern> You still had to form a complete sentence
[6:06:08] <+AceNugget> Yeah because you talked with them instead of just pulling triggers
[6:06:08] <Broken_Sonex> ONE SEC TOO LONG
[6:06:08] <Mattais88> yeah but pulling the trigger take .01 seconds
[6:06:10] <%Reveresao> Wrex: Would have taken half a second to kill them
[6:06:11] <falyden> he thirsts for blood
[6:06:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> BUT GUN GO FAST
[6:06:14] <zenorot> lol Garrus
[6:06:24] <HelluvaNohbody> Is this really worth minimum wage?
[6:06:29] <+BlockingDisabled> @hattrick61 Aw man, thanks though.
[6:06:31] <+AmericanSkidd> Yes, thats correct
[6:06:35] <+JaseAdrift> The fact that Garrus didnt just fucking shoot them was weird though
[6:06:42] <Goraka91> Garrus only kills bad guys though, would he really kill a bunch of workers?
[6:06:42] <BrianDLahey> Genius play
[6:06:49] <%RageCasanova> barrier
[6:06:56] <%Taisuru> LUL
[6:06:57] <BrianDLahey> @jaseadrift well said
[6:07:00] <+ScottishMadJacko> magic pixel
[6:07:06] <Goraka91> I mean Archangel would be he isn't at that point yet
[6:07:23] <Minorou> your teammates always give a paragon answer and renegade answer. Wrex is more renegade than Garrus, so Garrus gave the paragon talk
[6:07:27] <+AmericanSkidd> Fist is about to get Fisted by Wrex
[6:07:32] <$Mr_Lan_Party> How's the new Mass effect treating ya?
[6:07:40] <%QueequegTheater> Holy shit did they forget to remaster his haircut
[6:07:40] <%RageCasanova> space plaid fist? Really?
[6:07:41] <BlueLunecy> That means you know where she is dipshit
[6:07:43] <+JaseAdrift> Garrus and Wrex should be arguing about killing this guy
[6:07:43] <%Taisuru> "Even I"
[6:07:45] <%Ynkubus_> Just listen and you'll here the dummy thicc
[6:08:09] <Mattais88> Next door
[6:08:10] <%AncelDeLambert> TELL ME WHERE MY GIRLFRIEND IS!!

[6:10:06] <Jaysky> @AzureGale Liara or Tali I believe
[6:10:06] <huskarl_zap> liara
[6:10:08] <thebalticguy1> garrus will actually change starts neutral then lean towards shep
[6:10:09] <Archmortal> @AzureGale Liara is the nicest, but you can make Ashley nicer by the end
[6:10:16] <+yunngin> I was watching a like 3 hour KOTO 1 and 2 video essay and dude pointed out that Wrex is just Canderous and now I can't unsee it

[6:19:43] <%Piemen99> wouldnt she like die or something?
[6:19:44] <Manjove> FOILED AGAIN
[6:19:47] <Virokwet> LUL dang
[6:19:48] <+ScottishMadJacko> imagine if you toggled her helmet and she just got sick
[6:19:48] <%sporeian94> she would die pat...
[6:19:53] <Broken_Sonex> Why would they put that there for her if your can't toggle?
[6:19:53] <%zyberion626> Noveria sucks, but yeah
[6:19:58] <+JaseAdrift> Good if there's one thing you should never do its show tali's face
[6:20:02] <+Slattsquatch> What difficulty are you on??
[6:20:03] <Srthunda> they could have given her more helmet
[6:20:07] <Goraka91> @Piemen99 It would be extremely painful
[6:20:08] <+coolguynickxx69> Hit RB on Tali and she immediately contracts AIDs
[6:20:11] <%SWFanatic> hi elmo
[6:20:12] <peachy996> Yeah pretty ez
[6:20:12] <mar_krow> Easy
[6:20:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> you can toggle her helmet in 2 and 3 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[6:20:18] <Srthunda> or a little hat
[6:20:19] <%Dakuu75> is there a difficulty option?
[6:20:20] <+ScottishMadJacko> btw they changed her face reveal in me3
[6:20:22] <Manjove> @JaseAdrift yeah, who would be stupid enough to do that?
[6:20:24] <$hattrick61> They fixed her face in 3 btw
[6:20:25] <Parapattern> Good thing they didn't completely fuck up revealing Tali's face
[6:20:30] <dd44dostivei> you can use this save later to get around the spectre gear bug

[6:20:37] <%POUND_CAKE94> Noveria keeps me from doing a playthru a year. Such a slog to my brain
[6:20:44] <Archmortal> Keep track of that save before talking to the council if you care about getting those bugged spectre weapons when you actually unlock them

[6:22:18] <Goraka91> Man the texture people really dropped the ball on the hair huh
[6:22:20] <murdocismyhero> she turned into a husk
[6:22:21] <+GuilKato> this quest is dumb - the body is valuable for science / defense of others
[6:22:22] <%POUND_CAKE94> Does he come back in 3 in some form???
[6:22:25] <Broken_Sonex> Ohh, this side quest is actually super fucked
[6:22:25] <+AmericanSkidd> They dont even tell him why
[6:22:27] <karl_rex> Husk Wife
[6:22:28] <+GuilKato> there is a reason shepard
[6:22:34] <Dunmarkh> oh fuck she got roboted or something
[6:22:36] <+RealMichaelPhelps> :(
[6:22:36] <jorniev> expanse videogame when
[6:22:40] <no123450n> was she dusted
[6:22:46] <ChungusQuest> The Expensive Bar...hell of a name
[6:22:48] <Goraka91> @GuilKato and you can choose that option
[6:22:51] <+coolguynickxx69> "hey give that guy his wife" "no" "do it" "ok"
[6:22:51] <%POUND_CAKE94> She’s not goooooddd
[6:22:54] <+GuilKato> She's doing SCIENCE thats important
[6:23:02] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Definitely husk, but they should have told him
[6:23:07] <%MrBorisMakarov> does Bhatia ever come back in later games?
[6:23:09] <%Dakuu75> How do you know his wife deserves respect? What if she was a heartless, serial kill?
[6:23:09] <Mattais88> I remember doing the door dance, waiting for loads
[6:23:11] <DianaTheAscian> is the twist is that there is no body?
[6:23:16] <CurrentQuiet> sir your wife is a robot now, hope you're into that
[6:23:16] <+AmericanSkidd> She got shot by some bullshit
[6:23:28] <peachy996> This hair is shiny but also terrible
[6:23:42] <%SWFanatic> plastic hair
[6:23:44] <CurrentQuiet> oh nvm
[6:23:45] <$hattrick61> @mrborismakarov he sends you an email in 2 saying thank you
[6:23:50] <%AncelDeLambert> then tell him that.
[6:23:57] <%AncelDeLambert> it's bullshit that you're NOT telling him that
[6:23:58] <zenorot> isn't there special dialoug with Ashley?
[6:23:59] <+Buzzkill983> Now that's a bullshit way to say it
[6:24:00] <+GuilKato> you know what is dangerous??? Clementines Hair!
[6:24:05] <%MidnightBurst12> "respectfully"
[6:24:12] <Minorou> remember that news story of the guy who's grandma was "donated to science" but it was actually blown up by the military
[6:24:12] <%bassoontyphoon> Than tell him that
[6:24:16] <%MrBorisMakarov> @hattrick61 oh that's right I remember thnx :)
[6:24:16] <%Dakuu75> "very few" no NONE
[6:24:23] <%AncelDeLambert> then INFORM HIM
[6:24:27] <peachy996> It's certainly not the worst hair texture I've seen in videogames
[6:24:40] <+D00msDayDan> does this quest pay off in ME3?
[6:24:46] <%SWFanatic> ooooo burn
[6:24:47] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> But this quest line to no  result at all
[6:24:51] <dd44dostivei> SHOVE A GUN IN HIS FACE
[6:24:54] <peachy996> You're betraying the DEEEAAAAD
[6:24:55] <Mattais88> cereberus...
[6:24:57] <%bassoontyphoon> Nooooo
[6:24:57] <%QueequegTheater> Also, as a religious person it's fucking disgusting
[6:24:59] <no123450n> that was easy
[6:25:00] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> @D00msDayDan it dose not
[6:25:01] <iosephe> Mass Effect is very much against desecrating the dead
[6:25:03] <%SWFanatic> that was easy
[6:25:05] <peachy996> Now look to the right and walk away
[6:25:07] <Minorou> it does pay off in ME3 if you let the military keep the body
[6:25:10] <+GuilKato> but SCIENCE!
[6:25:12] <peachy996> EVERY TIME LMAO
[6:25:12] <Broken_Sonex> They use that fist in palm animation A LOT
[6:25:12] <+AceNugget> said the crap word to show he was serious
[6:25:14] <%bassoontyphoon> Bad End
[6:25:17] <%POUND_CAKE94> That was a Legendary line delivery
[6:25:19] <TomFrancis_> 2 pips PogChamp
[6:25:20] <+AmericanSkidd> I went back and convinced Samesh to let them keep the body
[6:25:21] <+Buzzkill983> Yes
[6:25:23] <+RyanTheRecluse> yeah
[6:25:23] <%QueequegTheater> Like, a TINY bit
[6:25:25] <+athuramn> bad ending
[6:25:26] <Profmcstevie> "do it" I dunno "fucking do it" damn shepherd you persuasive bitch
[6:25:26] <peachy996> Every time. Look to the right and Walk Away.
[6:25:28] <Zeif00> That man had some dry fuckin lips
[6:25:33] <%GarbageNirvana> As a stat on a bar, I'm sure
[6:25:33] <%Mr_Pylon> like what, 1% readiness?
[6:25:38] <FinalFantazC> I'm amazed how many tiny decisions they make reflect your later games
[6:25:41] <hambeerpig> Is it just a small contribution to the war effort thing?
[6:25:41] <+RahuHordika> Wait, pat is playing paragon?
[6:25:43] <%MrBorisMakarov> what does it do?
[6:25:45] <Broken_Sonex> @Minorou What does it do?
[6:25:45] <lloyddboy> doesn't it just make number go up
[6:25:45] <Minorou> yeah, just a tiny tiny bit
[6:25:46] <%POUND_CAKE94> Ahhhh that’s what I’m thinking of cool cool
[6:25:49] <no123450n> okay but also tell him why tho
[6:25:51] <Archmortal> it was SUPPOSED to pay off in ME2 but it never made it in
[6:25:55] <$hattrick61> Yeah but now Sam here will open a restaurant
[6:25:57] <%SWFanatic> hes got the crazy eyes
[6:25:57] <Dunmarkh> @RahuHordika he's trying
[6:25:59] <+GuilKato> is the bug still in legendary to get infinite paragon/renegade
[6:26:00] <%POUND_CAKE94> A tiny bit of galactic readiness??
[6:26:01] <peachy996> Good, Look to the right and walk away
[6:26:11] <+ScottishMadJacko> yeah, aliance fights geth better due to being better prepared against their weapons iirc
[6:26:11] <%Dakuu75> "your wife is coming home.", I would've phrased it "Your corpse will arrive shortly"
[6:26:12] <Minorou> @Broken_Sonex a small boost in military readiness for ME3
[6:26:15] <Goraka91> Oh that's what I did too
[6:26:17] <+ScottishMadJacko> agreedd
[6:26:18] <Jaysky> How about Goodbye.
[6:26:19] <Blank9> waking up cranky in 2
[6:26:19] <Archmortal> @GuilKato yes, so is the EXP bug on Therum
[6:26:20] <+coolguynickxx69> Me3 who cares
[6:26:22] <%moink1234> Did you play ME3?
[6:26:23] <$hattrick61> "How about goodbye"
[6:26:23] <vilecrois> ME2 evil Pat clone playthrough
[6:26:23] <%scaryboisupreme> Shepard comes back more pissed than ever
[6:26:25] <%NaturalZer0> Mass Effect 3 Renegade is like actually evil.
[6:26:28] <%POUND_CAKE94> Yupppp
[6:26:28] <Broken_Sonex> @Minorou Oh well, who cares
[6:26:30] <wasdsf> "I got better"
[6:26:30] <SirDuke26> Full renegade in Mass Effect 3 is kind of evil, still has its moments
[6:26:31] <Mattais88> unless your talking to illusive man, then fuck him
[6:26:31] <+ScottishMadJacko> the me2 renegade interrupts are too good
[6:26:31] <%Birdigalore> Only now do I realize those 2 people were the same model with a different skin tone lol
[6:26:32] <Basch71> ME3 IIRC was pretty ok on both
[6:26:34] <%toastybites> some paragon options actually fucks shit up more in ME3
[6:26:36] <%SWFanatic> hey hanar buddy
[6:26:42] <%SWFanatic> yes enkindle me
[6:26:44] <+neonNeptunian> he got r e b u i l t
[6:26:45] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Brain damage from getting spaces in ME2?
[6:26:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh right, that theory
[6:26:45] <+ScottishMadJacko> How about goodbye is cold
[6:26:47] <Goraka91> ME2 Renegade is an action hero, ME3 Renegade is all the war crimes
[6:26:48] <peachy996> Mass Effect 3 I go Paragon, Renegade is meh
[6:26:50] <+JaseAdrift> its a bizarre explanation though
[6:26:56] <%Dakuu75> that is just a Portuguese <an'O War
[6:26:56] <%POUND_CAKE94> Squid fuck time babyyyy
[6:26:57] <%Noir_Valdr> as someone who has done both many many many times...pure paragon ME1, paragon with occasional renegade moments in ME2 and 3 are the best way
[6:26:57] <%QueequegTheater> Pat HATES religious freedom Kappa
[6:27:00] <%Reveresao> buy!
[6:27:01] <%SWFanatic> trouble me with your truth
[6:27:02] <peachy996> Although you can do some really cold stuff
[6:27:02] <ScreamLord> Because he's a space Frankenstein's monster
[6:27:07] <%bassoontyphoon> Me3 as paragon, but with the “Renegade” final choice is my go to
[6:27:09] <+coolguynickxx69> "I know nothing about your religion but this is wrong"
[6:27:11] <zenorot> I thought he was a clone in ME2
[6:27:15] <+ScottishMadJacko> Me3 renegade is mostly actually evil
[6:27:18] <dd44dostivei> renegade in 3 is insane
[6:27:22] <%Bt_Robot> The upgrade tree makes it seem like shepherd is mostly machine by the end of ME2
[6:27:23] <BlueLunecy> They totally would though
[6:27:29] <+D00msDayDan> s o c i e t y
[6:27:37] <Goraka91> @bassoontyphoon Man how is that renegade when control is literally what Cerberus wanted
[6:27:37] <+Buzzkill983> Mass Effect 2 Renegade is wacky space crimes, Mass Effect 3 Renegade is super war crimes. I only do Paragon on that game
[6:27:43] <peachy996> Big Stupid Jellyfish
[6:27:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> I totally just bought his permit
[6:27:46] <+GuilKato> if only you could put it on your spaceship
[6:27:49] <Mattais88> bribe?
[6:27:51] <+AmericanSkidd> He went to sunday school like a good Hanar
[6:27:51] <Broken_Sonex> It honestly makes sense for Shepard to go Renegade in ME2. He died and should be super pissed about that.
[6:28:02] <%Order_of_Mystery> renegade in 3 is dickishly evil, and leads to you betraying wrex. bad
[6:28:05] <+Slattsquatch> I go all paragon except for punching that reporter in the face and stabbing Kai Leng, because fuck Kai Leng
[6:28:07] <%Birdigalore> Consume Omni-Gel
[6:28:13] <$hattrick61> BIG. STUPID. JELLYFISH
[6:28:13] <Zalapski> OK, but "the enkindlers" were actually xenophobic galaxy-conquering assholes, sooooo....
[6:28:16] <faithless_zealot> what?~
[6:28:20] <%BestTeaMaker> audio?
[6:28:20] <+ScottishMadJacko> I hate all those theories about me2 and 3

[6:28:29] <%Monkeyweed21> look at the Map
[6:28:31] <TomFrancis_> was there always the music?
[6:28:32] <peachy996> I think the Paragon version of Khalisa is way better
[6:28:34] <ahaegotrigger> she has a point

[6:28:56] <%POUND_CAKE94> Love itttt
[6:28:59] <Zalapski> chat, can you believe elevator music doesn't improve over the next two centuries
[6:28:59] <%scaryboisupreme> I NEVER noticed that

[6:29:00] <%MidnightBurst12> oh shit
[6:29:02] <@StridentSong> That's a bug in the original

[6:29:26] <+ScottishMadJacko> I wonder why the elevator voices are fine on console but not pc
[6:29:27] <+Toaderator> all the renegade in me1 is net loss war assets in me3, 2 and 3 are way more balanced
[6:29:27] <Goraka91> @Zalapski To be fair, we don't know if they were always like that or because our frame of reference was the tail end of them losing the war with the reapoers
[6:29:28] <%MidnightBurst12> tha baby
[6:29:31] <%thorzer> thorzer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! whats the diff between this and the old one

[6:30:03] <wasdsf> why did udina jojo pose
[6:30:07] <%Noir_Valdr> @PatStaresAt ok now keep that save and make a backup of it so you can get the spectre weapons later
[6:30:12] <peachy996> Yeah Sparatus!
[6:30:12] <ahaegotrigger> it is?
[6:30:14] <%maenos2> IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE

[6:30:19] <%maenos2> CAN'T BE FAKED, NO SIR
[6:30:20] <+D00msDayDan> this single soundbyte from a quarian is enough to get saren convicted, in this space future where deepfake tech must be ridiculous
[6:30:21] <Virokwet> in a time before deepfakes
[6:30:24] <%zyberion626> oh hey at least the Council is actually doing something
[6:30:25] <Zombrocom> I feel like this level of tech could easily fake that
[6:30:26] <%Monkeyweed21> WAIT WHAT ABOUT DEEPFAKES
[6:30:30] <vilecrois> She's a MILF, Shepard.
[6:30:33] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt deep fake. saren in innocent
[6:30:40] <huskarl_zap> We live in a matriarchy

[6:30:47] <%SWFanatic> @vilecrois lol
[6:30:48] <ape_hawk> SHE HAS HUGE MOMMY MILKERS, SHEPARD
[6:30:55] <@StridentSong> I don't know what that means
[6:30:58] <+Toaderator> bug
[6:30:59] <%TheFabledAble> AGAIN. How is this common knowledge this early
[6:31:05] <+ScottishMadJacko> I dont know either
[6:31:06] <%Noir_Valdr> @PatStaresAt nope, they'll disappear later. It's a bug
[6:31:09] <%AncelDeLambert> I got up to do something, what?
[6:31:09] <buhbuhboat> there's a bug
[6:31:11] <dd44dostivei> use it  to load guns in game memory, and then load your current save
[6:31:12] <Archmortal> I've been trying to say that for a while, the tier VII ones are bugged
[6:31:14] <%DJFakie> It goes away for a while if you talk to him until you level up.
[6:31:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> it's a bug where you can lose access to spectre weapons
[6:31:20] <Archmortal> that is EXACTLY how it fixes it
[6:31:25] <ahaegotrigger> just save a ton of money you can get the spectre master weapons
[6:31:25] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> That is the workaround.
[6:31:26] <+HefestoForges> is it not fixed in this version
[6:31:28] <Dunmarkh> what the fuck are
[6:31:31] <%POUND_CAKE94> It somehow fixes it
[6:31:35] <%QueequegTheater> That's fucking wild
[6:31:36] <dd44dostivei> yes
[6:31:37] <+ScottishMadJacko> how does loading an old save fix it?
[6:31:38] <%Noir_Valdr> verey much so
[6:31:42] <buhbuhboat> I feel like LE has more bugs than the original games
[6:31:43] <+Toaderator> spectre x shows up after virmire now
[6:31:44] <+D00msDayDan> that's fucked
[6:31:45] <%Dakuu75> You guys mean, load your back-up save THEN load your main-save?
[6:31:45] <%Monkeyweed21> yea it is
[6:31:45] <%Noir_Valdr> and I real;ly hope they patch that
[6:31:47] <Goraka91> Oh I think I must've got that bug when I played it years ago then
[6:31:47] <+Gespens> thats a fucking SPEEDRUN bug
[6:31:48] <%SkyfireHero> spectre gear only spawns once you have 1,000,000 credits/level 50
[6:31:48] <Archmortal> you have to re-become a spectre, then talk to c-sec to open the shop, then load the save
[6:31:49] <peachy996> Yeah well strap in, lots of stupid
[6:31:50] <Mattais88> but then you'd have to redo everything again?
[6:31:51] <%Noir_Valdr> because yup, very very stupid
[6:31:52] <zenorot> they didn't fix the bugs from the original
[6:31:52] <%DJFakie> @ScottishMadJacko It puts the gun in game memory
[6:31:54] <+neonNeptunian> roflmao yes
[6:31:54] <dd44dostivei> it's where they fucked with acheivements
[6:31:56] <+broaches> Reminds me of the oblivion vampire bug where it changed your genders, and you have to fix it by loading an old save then current save
[6:31:58] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> That's really dumb, yeah, certainly a bug
[6:31:59] <%POUND_CAKE94> Very stupid
[6:32:03] <Dunmarkh> makes sense I guess
[6:32:05] <Archmortal> you specifically have to become a spectre again, you cannot do it with a save AFTER becoming a spectre
[6:32:07] <%Noir_Valdr> @SkyfireHero not in this version actually
[6:32:23] <%CopperTucker> Anderson looks awful, holy shit
[6:32:24] <%DJFakie> The infinite Paragon bug in Noveria is still in
[6:32:26] <$hattrick61> so am i fucked outta the specter weapons?
[6:32:36] <+Slattsquatch> The real Conduit was the friends we made along the way
[6:32:37] <%SWFanatic> ...how does everyone know this?
[6:32:40] <%TheFabledAble> SPACE IS REALLY BIG DUDE
[6:32:40] <+D00msDayDan> we have dismissed those claims
[6:32:43] <peachy996> I love Councilor Sparatus, He's always on your side
[6:32:43] <Ranger747> good sneeze
[6:32:46] <Goraka91> @CopperTucker The lighting isn't doing anyone any favours
[6:32:48] <pth88> I didnt do that in my game and the spectre weapons still showed up at the end
[6:32:52] <+Toaderator> theyll patch it soon
[6:32:54] <Ranger747> i like that
[6:32:58] <%SkyfireHero> @noir_valdr once you get past virmire it seems to work
[6:33:00] <%Birdigalore> WE'RE GONNA MAKE EVERY MISTAKE CUZ FUCK YOU!
[6:33:04] <%Noir_Valdr> @hattrick61 there's a save on the Nexus you can download that you can use to "reload" the weapons and get them on your own save
[6:33:04] <+Slattsquatch> Ah yes "Reapers"
[6:33:07] <%POUND_CAKE94> Look at this tokin’ turian
[6:33:17] <%AncelDeLambert> not even dream thing, YOU SAW THE SHIP DESCEND ON THE COLONY
[6:33:17] <%TheFabledAble> HOW ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT IN THIS THIS EARLY SHEPARD
[6:33:19] <xxshadowxx416> A SOUL REAPER
[6:33:23] <Jaysky> Reapers are fake news
[6:33:26] <Archmortal> The Tier X spectre weapons unlock after virmire separately from the tier VII versions, and are NOT bugged
[6:33:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> homeboy literally has a robot army
[6:33:34] <zenorot> How do they know the reapers even existed?
[6:33:36] <%Noir_Valdr> @SkyfireHero well that's weird and makes it even more of a weird bug lol
[6:33:41] <ahaegotrigger> it totally could LUL
[6:33:44] <+Golinvoxx> You would think after this moment shepard would wear a body cam 24/7 with people constantly telling him this shit
[6:33:48] <hambeerpig> At war with who?
[6:33:48] <jorniev> SEND ME
[6:33:51] <%Noir_Valdr> @Archmortal ahh, that explains it
[6:33:51] <%Andrizzleton> this bestowing of the title of spectre is still pretty epic
[6:33:55] <%QueequegTheater> Not it the overall scope of things
[6:34:02] <Jaysky> BULL-
[6:34:02] <%Dakuu75> coward-censor
[6:34:02] <Essixian> ANTI-HUMAN BULL-
[6:34:06] <+AmericanSkidd> I've heard this speech so many times its ingrained in my mind
[6:34:10] <%QueequegTheater> FUCK YOU SPARATUS
[6:34:12] <ape_hawk> MAKE SHEPARD A SPACE GESTAPO
[6:34:15] <peachy996> See? He's always on your side lol

[6:34:24] <Goraka91> Shepard is the solution
[6:34:25] <iosephe> They could just send a different spectre
[6:34:28] <%TheFabledAble> MAKE THE HUMAN JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONER DO IIIIIT
[6:34:29] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> The STG could ABSOLUTELY find Saren, they just won't commit to it

[6:47:00] <%Taisuru> LUL
[6:47:01] <%Solid_Stro> That’s a good burn
[6:47:02] <%AncelDeLambert> that's some classic banter
[6:47:02] <%POUND_CAKE94> Proven fact that the Turians fucking love Berserk
[6:47:09] <Ranger747> savage
[6:47:20] <%dekkitout> I thought his most famous quote was "YO FDR- watch me do a keg stand!"
[6:47:37] <peachy996> Ignore Heart appeal to WAR
[6:47:44] <Mattais88> Turians have CLEMP arms
[6:47:47] <wasdsf> the turians would totally love berserk
[6:47:57] <Broken_Sonex> Terrians would SO be into anime
[6:47:58] <%itschickenscratch> itschickenscratch subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! im here for the gief
[6:47:58] <dd44dostivei> turian generals are like mediocre civil servants apparently
[6:48:02] <%StaceMcGate> would a cold shower even do anything to a Turian?
[6:48:03] <titanor3> He had a call from some other politician on the toilet once, he said 'I can’t deal with two turds at once’ or something like that
[6:48:19] <%POUND_CAKE94> Turians would say Eren did nothing wrong
[6:48:28] <+AmericanSkidd> @POUND_CAKE94 Who'd be into Berserk more? Turians or Krogan?
[6:48:31] <peachy996> I think every Turian in this series has a cool name
[6:48:32] <%Xelhesia> elmo is experiencing space and aliens
[6:48:42] <Tennochief> @AmericanSkidd both
[6:48:50] <%Zundelle> baby
[6:48:55] <Broken_Sonex> Turians would say AOT ended really well
[6:48:57] <Tennochief> but for wildly different reasons
[6:48:59] <%zyberion626> @AmericanSkidd Turians, Krogans wouldn't enjoy all the angst
[6:49:00] <wasdsf> Everyone knows krogans cant read
[6:49:02] <%Taisuru> What does elmo think of men pointing guns at him?
[6:49:04] <%StaceMcGate> this is a lame ass strip club
[6:49:04] <%dekkitout> How does Elmo feel about the space gun violence
[6:49:05] <peachy996> Talk to Jenna
[6:49:08] <%SWFanatic> elmo is baby
[6:49:09] <aiutare47> Turians live on Starship Troopers rules, they would love anything that contains a cool guy killing bad guys

[6:49:46] <%POUND_CAKE94> Hahahahahaha we got him to see it

[6:49:52] <%dekkitout> That can either tell someone how AoT ends- or Turians outlook on life
[6:49:53] <peachy996> I think Batarians would get a kick out of it
[6:49:57] <%SWFanatic> hi hk47

[7:00:49] <dashmatt> Do more mission
[7:00:49] <%dekkitout> Have you tried selling out over narcing?
[7:00:50] <wasdsf> I think a lot of the money comes from exploration in the mission areas
[7:00:51] <%Xelhesia> elmo is zen now
[7:00:52] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> For the first third of the game you are a broke bitch
[7:00:53] <%SWFanatic> if it aint broke don't fix it
[7:00:53] <softbirby> Isn't Samara the actor who did trinity in the Matrix?
[7:00:54] <%Monkeyweed21> ELMO IS ASCENDING
[7:00:54] <%DJFakie> You're kind of broke, you'll cap out at 9,999,999 really quick
[7:00:55] <+neonNeptunian> wHAT

[7:00:59] <peachy996> At this stage of the game, it's normal
[7:01:00] <Archmortal> the beginning of the game the economy is dumb, yeah
[7:01:02] <generalve> @patstaresat don't worry about credits. the game gives them out like candy
[7:01:03] <Mattais88> It's an RPG, if you're not broke you're in endgame
[7:01:03] <%Bt_Robot> You make money selling old equipment
[7:01:04] <+Burnsy_4_> Smells like BROKE in here
[7:01:05] <metaphase72> Renegade playthrough on this game is literally hilarious
[7:01:06] <+AceNugget> smooth clean space future too bright for elmo
[7:01:14] <+jepupu> Finally watched the FFXIV Endwalker trailer. Pat might have been overselling it a BIT in the podcast

[7:01:20] <%Taisuru> Emlo big
[7:01:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Elmo is falling asleep lol
[7:01:21] <+KingRipoff1> by the end of it tho i had more money than i knew what to do with
[7:01:25] <Basch71> you get cash like crazy by mid-game
[7:01:34] <%POUND_CAKE94> Dude those planet will make you rich it is an exponential ramp
[7:01:38] <%DJFakie> Elmo's closing his eyes because he trusts us, and that's a mistake
[7:01:39] <Archmortal> once you go get resources and kill shit you get rich pretty fast, and you get exponentially more from selling higher tier equipment
[7:01:46] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> GIB SPOOKY GHOST GUNS

[7:03:21] <metaphase72> Put points into decryption first so you can open all boxes and sell all the mods and guns that you don't use.  You can easily get 4 million credits before Feros
[7:03:22] <%AncelDeLambert> I could have sworn this was in the original
[7:03:30] <dd44dostivei> you can also sort items now
[7:03:33] <%BestTeaMaker> omg thank god you can multi select now
[7:03:34] <%newtmcgoot> Oh wow you're still streaming it's been like 7 hours
[7:03:37] <titanor3> I wholeheartedly recommend Raycevick’s video essays on the Mass Effect franchise, he goes in depth about planned features in development and the features they had to compromise on
[7:03:42] <%BestTeaMaker> the menu-ing in this game is dogshit
[7:03:43] <%DJFakie> All this is worth nothing so you might prefer to gel it
[7:03:43] <Archmortal> for real though, they're so worthless that the omni-gel is better than the money right now
[7:03:43] <metaphase72> i think it's decryption skill
[7:03:49] <%scaryboisupreme> @X2Eliah you gotta click the trashcan icon
[7:03:49] <%newtmcgoot> Mass effect is a good game
[7:03:56] <+GuilKato> way to break the geneva conventions pat
[7:04:01] <tech_nus> How is Shepard standing, he looks like he has a stick up his ass
[7:04:05] <peachy996> What a great Soundtrack
[7:04:07] <%newtmcgoot> Him!! The handsome krogan
[7:04:24] <%DJFakie> They don't seem to tell you if a party member is untrained in a gun anymore
[7:04:24] <%monsieurfantastic> omg, ive gone to bed and woke up. hes still playing LUL
[7:04:37] <metaphase72> only bad thing about Mass effect 1 is that you can't romance Tali
[7:04:37] <%X2Eliah> !uptime
[7:04:38] <@Moobot> @X2Eliah I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 7h 4m.
[7:04:58] <%SWFanatic> still broke
[7:04:59] <titanor3> Pat how many times have you beaten these games?
[7:05:02] <crookedfinger68> rekt
[7:05:03] <%StaceMcGate> Did Pat announce who he is romancing?
[7:05:18] <%DJFakie> Early gear might be worth more to gel until higher tier stuff that's actually worth cash
[7:05:20] <Archmortal> low tier gear is worthless, bette to gel them
[7:05:26] <%SWFanatic> Pats romancing Paige
[7:05:30] <karl_rex> Is the infinite money exploit still there in this version?
[7:05:32] <TheApeGatsby> He better be romancing Jacob
[7:05:39] <%newtmcgoot> Pat if you have to choose garrus or wrex
[7:05:41] <%Xelhesia> orb man
[7:05:48] <titanor3> NOT BEING ABLE TO ROMANCE GARRUS AS A MALE IS A TRAVESTY
[7:05:49] <%X2Eliah> It's all scaled to your level, so all gear is useful for not-much-time
[7:05:50] <%StaceMcGate> @TheApeGatsby the priiiize
[7:06:09] <Archmortal> @karl_rex I'm not sure, but getting double for selling to the med clinic is still in
[7:06:12] <peachy996> I want all the time I can get~
[7:06:20] <%newtmcgoot> the daaaaataaaa

[7:07:35] <%X2Eliah> wha?
[7:07:38] <%newtmcgoot> he's kinda hot
[7:07:40] <+GuilKato> so you can do the quest twice?
[7:07:42] <metaphase72> wait how did you just now get the scanner?
[7:07:42] <+AmericanSkidd> Sequence broken
[7:07:43] <%dekkitout> LuvUok
[7:07:47] <TonberryLives> huh?
[7:07:53] <%DJFakie> Redundancy. You can not talk to Chorban.
[7:07:54] <peachy996> Um.
[7:07:57] <HeroToxiko> from "i'll kill you" to "pay me" in 5 seconds LUL
[7:07:57] <%Taisuru> Did you a fuck?
[7:07:57] <%X2Eliah> Oh I guess this was another entry point to the keeper quest
[7:07:58] <%StaceMcGate> @newtmcgoot ...who are you referring too?
[7:07:59] <peachy996> You did it!
[7:08:00] <buhbuhboat> you don't have to do it again
[7:08:00] <titanor3> Groundhog day
[7:08:02] <Archmortal> it's a redundance, yeah
[7:08:06] <%Monkeyweed21> 2 ways to get the quest
[7:08:06] <%dekkitout> What kind of Dark Brotherhood Forever shit?
[7:08:19] <peachy996> Oh god Emily Wong
[7:08:19] <Jaysky> Camera shake run
[7:08:22] <%Alazull> I forgot how much this game makes me think of The Last Starfighter
[7:08:22] <%newtmcgoot> @newtmcgoot you know exactly who i meant
[7:08:27] <peachy996> Flashbacks of ME3 just never stop
[7:08:28] <%Taisuru> RAve
[7:08:30] <deafmutelaughing> hyperspeed elevator
[7:08:31] <Dunmarkh> oh no
[7:08:33] <%QueequegTheater> SPEED
[7:08:36] <%X2Eliah> ...
[7:08:42] <Archmortal> I love that the elevator gives you quests
[7:08:42] <%DJFakie> These elevators would give serious whiplash.
[7:08:43] <%X2Eliah> Those elevators are not meant to go that fast xD
[7:08:48] <dd44dostivei> hyperlift load times
[7:08:49] <titanor3> BUGS
[7:08:51] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> interdimensional elevator
[7:08:51] <@StridentSong> I do kinda like that you get sidequest hints from the elevators
[7:08:51] <%DJFakie> Goddammit, Lang.
[7:08:51] <%X2Eliah> It could be framerate related speed
[7:08:53] <ChortlesJ1> BEEF MCLARGEHUGE
[7:08:54] <%StaceMcGate> WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FACE
[7:08:56] <+AmericanSkidd> Take your slow elevator memes and SPEED AWAY
[7:08:57] <titanor3> CRAWLIES
[7:09:00] <%X2Eliah> I play at 75fps and it doesn't move that fast
[7:09:02] <deafmutelaughing> Brock Lesnar?
[7:09:03] <HeroToxiko> the voice clips have to be shorter now LUL
[7:09:06] <peachy996> The hair is so shiny and metallic
[7:09:07] <%DJFakie> Working on Windjammers 2 over there

[7:09:11] <CyberKN> Dave Lang

[7:09:17] <%SWFanatic> Big chungus got the beetus
[7:09:18] <cybz99> This dude's face looks like its been pummeled daily for a decade
[7:09:22] <+AmericanSkidd> Lang always looked like this
[7:09:22] <+neonNeptunian> COP
[7:09:23] <%Monkeyweed21> NARC FAMILY
[7:09:29] <titanor3> Brother to Kai?
[7:09:33] <+storkeylope> Kai Lang's cousin???

[7:09:39] <ThePeaceMain> OINK OINK

[7:09:43] <+AmericanSkidd> He probably chill
[7:09:44] <dd44dostivei> the most nothing npc in the trilogy
[7:09:52] <%newtmcgoot> aliens are people they're just cooler
[7:09:55] <Mattais88> He's better Ashley

[7:10:06] <%Deft_Thought> WICKED BRAH
[7:10:07] <%X2Eliah> This guy is not involved in any quest, right?
[7:10:08] <%GarbageNirvana> He really likes doing that headshake
[7:10:12] <peachy996> Lang shows up at the end too
[7:10:13] <%scaryboisupreme> You should just be a narc for humans and give aliens free passes
[7:10:18] <%DJFakie> You thought wrong, Lang.
[7:10:31] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[7:10:32] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK HIS OMNI TOOL BUGGED OUT
[7:10:35] <ahaegotrigger> hes so naive
[7:10:43] <%GarbageNirvana> If you think about it Spectres are basically just legally sanctioned Punishers
[7:10:46] <+AmericanSkidd> OHHH
[7:10:48] <crookedfinger68> nice.
[7:10:48] <%SWFanatic> 0/10

[7:10:53] <Broken_Sonex> They use them BECAUSE they're that bad
[7:10:59] <+dreadsnappi> It's God!
[7:11:00] <%DJFakie> Being arrested is not proof of guilt, Lang!
[7:11:00] <peachy996> Maybe he's using it to scratch his back
[7:11:06] <%Deft_Thought> I'm turning in. Thanks for streaming @PatStaresAt

[7:11:15] <%DJFakie> "Congratulations on your raid and murder"

[7:14:09] <peachy996> Man really wants to push Quasar tho
[7:14:13] <%X2Eliah> the most nothing gambling game ever

[7:15:02] <%DJFakie> Oh Jeez, I didn't even see Zangief there.
[7:15:02] <titanor3> A prerequisite for being in C-Sec is knowing how to perform a C-Section
[7:15:10] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat did you get the rigged quasar game station?
[7:15:12] <%MidnightBurst12> that runs like shit
[7:15:15] <%Monkeyweed21> why isnt pat using the fast travel?
[7:15:36] <%DJFakie> A bunch of these quests don't show up until your first story planet
[7:15:40] <Profmcstevie> Pretty AND high performance, welcome to the world of tomorrrowww~
[7:15:53] <%X2Eliah> @Monkeyweed21 It's kinda like playing skyrim without fast travel, more immersive
[7:15:58] <%DJFakie> Shepard: "View Items"
[7:16:00] <titanor3> @patstaresat Red blue or green?
[7:16:14] <%X2Eliah> Heh.
[7:16:23] <peachy996> You start with nothing.
[7:16:23] <%Monkeyweed21> you have yet to visit a single real planet
[7:16:29] <+DarkOnyx7> buying gear usually isn't worth it until later imo
[7:16:29] <%X2Eliah> Do you walk up to a grocery store clerk and just say "View Items!"
[7:16:29] <$lotharrio> Save up for Spectre stuff.
[7:16:31] <peachy996> With your broke ass
[7:16:39] <%DJFakie> I didn't even know there were DMRs and burst fire guns in this game until I played the remaster
[7:16:40] <Dunmarkh> @titanor3 we'll burn that bridge when we cross it
[7:16:41] <Thepothero> Buy the license s
[7:16:56] <%SWFanatic> welcome to my boob window
[7:16:58] <$lotharrio> It's all bullshit until then... the auto heal armor is sort of good for saving resources early on.
[7:16:59] <%X2Eliah> Yeah buying (and even selling) is pointless. Just omnigel everything
[7:17:12] <%dekkitout> Sheps a madlad
[7:17:12] <+AmericanSkidd> As blunt as a hammer
[7:17:13] <%newtmcgoot> Glass her
[7:17:18] <%Xelhesia> that dominant stance
[7:17:21] <titanor3> The final assault rifle is straight up laser accurate
[7:17:29] <%moogleboy1984> Good old Thousand Yard Bioware Stare
[7:17:29] <Archmortal> nah selling helps get shit way sooner, but only once you're at least at like tier V gear
[7:17:33] <peachy996> Now leave
[7:17:36] <HeroToxiko> gogo dancers are tough as shit
[7:17:39] <%BappoTheMighty> omg you're still going!?
[7:17:39] <ahaegotrigger> neither do strippers honestly LUL
[7:17:47] <peachy996> Ah yeah Chellick was his name

[7:20:12] <time2getsweaty> "just need some of their product"

[7:20:36] <%blutzwavedave> GOTCHA

[7:40:36] <+Totally_Not_Toby> nah you have one naturally
[7:40:43] <KaitlynnHere> You done dead
[7:40:44] <DefaultSettiings> robots die when they are killed
[7:40:45] <+pre10cious_1> Damn,  you charming AF
[7:40:46] <Zalapski> well that just got tali all hot and bothered
[7:40:48] <Archmortal> you get free points at certain thresholds
[7:40:51] <ianabstract> do you even lift bro
[7:40:51] <@StridentSong> You get some points naturally as Paragon/Renegade goes up
[7:40:51] <time2getsweaty> that reminds me of the Sentient Vending machine from Cyber Punk
[7:40:55] <KaitlynnHere> You earned that point
[7:40:58] <+trackles_64> YOu can respec in the second run
[7:41:10] <%DJFakie> Stasis is like the worst power in this game because it makes the enemy invincible
[7:41:33] <peachy996> Forgot Wrex is a Biotic sometimes
[7:41:39] <DefaultSettiings> spec more into her thighs SeemsGood
[7:41:40] <peachy996> Doesn't come across as much in 3
[7:41:53] <+trackles_64> @DJFakie  no it freezes them, useful against alrge enemies that rush like krogan warlords and geth destroyers
[7:41:55] <peachy996> I think they gave him Lift Grenade for the DLC
[7:41:56] <%DJFakie> Electronics and Decrypting you need to unlock chests too
[7:41:57] <%StaceMcGate> you have like half of everyone's skills and you haven't left the Citadel yet
[7:42:01] <filialpails> make tali damp
[7:42:05] <venny_doe> oh i hate that shaky running cam
[7:42:18] <%mordred_t> That this man is not maxing out the equivalent of lockpicking in space is really bothering me
[7:42:21] <+trackles_64> What difficulty is pat on?
[7:42:21] <%allups> thats great
[7:42:23] <%X2Eliah> They put so much content into citadel, too
[7:42:27] <%DJFakie> @trackles_64 It does but they're invincible during that time, at least according to the description. It even says AI won't use it unless you tell them.
[7:42:30] <%QueequegTheater> It feels like they lowered the level cap but didn't scale the XP properly
[7:42:34] <%DJFakie> It's different in 2 and 3.
[7:42:37] <%Taisuru> Fatty boi
[7:42:51] <Fictionnaire> Leveling gets much slower in the late game tho.
[7:42:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> mass effect 2 is great, I'm sad they toned down the rpg elements tho :(
[7:43:01] <%X2Eliah> I wonder how pat will deal with the rachni
[7:43:03] <Fictionnaire> Like waaaaay slower.
[7:43:04] <TheAntiCurse> Eva elevator?
[7:43:04] <brunoberserk> Max is playing VF , looks really good
[7:43:06] <+trackles_64> @DJFakie  they cant be shot but they cant fire or move. its a power to lock down space.
[7:43:08] <%X2Eliah> but we will get there in time
[7:43:09] <dd44dostivei> trilogy wide difficulty kinda scales
[7:43:10] <+trackles_64> Pat is smart
[7:43:14] <peachy996> Whaaat? nooooo
[7:43:22] <peachy996> What if we uplifted the Yahg?
[7:43:23] <%QueequegTheater> @X2Eliah I mean, he is anti-genocide
[7:43:23] <%dekkitout> "I am de keptain?"

[7:45:22] <%newtmcgoot> be nice to her
[7:45:22] <peachy996> I'd do that. I hate Liara
[7:45:24] <nelsonq415> no Snu Snu?
[7:45:26] <$Clarke1010> which would make his appearance in ME2 FUCKED up
[7:45:26] <+trackles_64> Alien sex plz
[7:45:26] <Jaysky> That's a neat way to add her late in
[7:45:31] <RetributionP> and multiple dlc is ruined right?
[7:45:37] <dd44dostivei> take wrex to noveria too. he gets hungry
[7:45:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> also she finds out her life's work has been essentially solved by some random human, and her mother is dead. it's a bummer
[7:45:39] <DefaultSettiings> just fuck Tali like everyone else
[7:45:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Liara's character arc is so fucking WEIRD
[7:45:53] <+pre10cious_1> liara is baby mama material GivePLZ TakeNRG
[7:46:01] <%dekkitout> Terry?
[7:46:06] <%DJFakie> Do not Buster Wolf the captain, Pat!
[7:46:07] <%QueequegTheater> @DefaultSettiings I will fuck Thane and feel good about it thank you very much.
[7:46:08] <%AncelDeLambert> she goes from a scientist that's oddly okay at fighting to KINGPIN OF CRIIIIIIME
[7:46:10] <Broken_Sonex> How does that carry over into the other games?
[7:46:18] <motfeg> I forgot Shepard was a specter was that even addressed in the sequels
[7:46:20] <+pally_din> Thanks Keith David
[7:46:23] <kifflomdolphin> Pat is going to rescue the virgin, dorky college girl so she can shoot her mom, who's working for a Space Super Cop who's being mind controlled by a billion year old space lobster.

[7:46:37] <peachy996> Lol that was always a weird conversation
[7:46:40] <$Clarke1010> First ME novel right there. Did you read any of them Patt?
[7:46:46] <SilverWolfX9> @kifflomdolphin that's a way to word jt
[7:46:53] <%DJFakie> @motfeg Yeah, but only as a token. They'll re-instate you, and some dialogue reflects that.
[7:47:17] <%mordred_t> Pat, you strike me as the type of person that would max Decryption/Electronics ASAP so you can get every piece of loot. So why spread skillsinstead of minmax?
[7:47:19] <motfeg> Incredible
[7:47:37] <%QueequegTheater> O_O
[7:47:42] <%X2Eliah> Batarians are the most "species of just plain assholes" race in mass effect

[7:48:25] <%AbnormalVoid> Saren doesn't FUCKING CARE
[7:48:31] <dd44dostivei> that's some historical tragedy numbers
[7:48:36] <+pre10cious_1> Saren is just a smarter General Grieveous
[7:48:37] <%DJFakie> How DO holograms work in this universe? They make parts of you transparent!
[7:48:41] <%mordred_t> I love how Saren has like geth cybernectics replacing half his upper body and nobody points this out.
[7:48:49] <%Valdorick> Saren just sounds like renegade Sheperd.
[7:48:59] <KaitlynnHere> @hananafell he also looks like he’s packing a big barbed dong in those pants
[7:49:03] <ssks123> wow big space racist
[7:49:06] <ssks123> spacist
[7:49:07] <HeroToxiko> he just don't give a fuuuuck

[7:49:15] <venny_doe> that wasn't the dialogue option at all lmao
[7:49:16] <peachy996> Saren was supoosed to have geth parts over time

[7:50:11] <%maenos2> @Valdorick not the soup part but he thought the best outcome was to basically make the races useful and be turned collector-like-ish

[7:53:44] <kifflomdolphin> I'm very surprised that Pat isn't doing a Renegade path, due to his love of absolute trash/ evil options in games.
[7:53:49] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Hey I just realized the Normandy VI is totally FemShep
[7:53:49] <%mordred_t> Shepard never gets any promotion s because it would ruin John Marketing's Brand Recognition

[7:57:06] <%pwnjones> Geif is currently an M79 Grenade launcher
[7:57:07] <%dekkitout> That is a chunk of a day
[7:57:16] <%pwnjones> *foomp*
[7:57:29] <RetributionP> I'm still here I did everything I wanted to do in 14
[7:57:50] <+hananafell> Time makes fools of us all
[7:57:55] <peachy996> It is a 14 year old game
[7:58:05] <Virokwet> yup. I barely noticed Ashley bs when i first play ME
[7:58:05] <peachy996> It's GONNA age
[7:58:17] <+pre10cious_1> ME2 is still a banger dansnaHot
[7:58:22] <+hananafell> I cant believe the terminus systems has WMDs
[7:58:24] <%X2Eliah> yep
[7:58:26] <Irishgamerlawd> ah yes the aged thing aged
[7:58:42] <%TheFabledAble> they did a terrorism and now we gotta give people impunity to kill!!!
[7:58:44] <Daniel_Is_I> It's only when you go back to Gex 3 and realize all of his references don't make sense.
[7:58:47] <%Monkeyweed21> man MGS4 is REALLY 2008
[7:58:51] <Profmcstevie> You can smell the development year sometimes
[7:58:56] <%Xelhesia> tom and jerry too
[7:58:57] <DefaultSettiings> aged yoghurt still looks good in its package SeemsGood
[7:58:58] <%POUND_CAKE94> Playing FFX right now. Good early PS2 shenanigans abound in that game
[7:59:01] <+Shackle_Rustyford> pre ww2
[7:59:03] <dd44dostivei> 1950s
[7:59:03] <peachy996> RE6 is very age
[7:59:05] <aiutare47> also the faces still look rough
[7:59:05] <%scaryboisupreme> My donation messages will tell a tale of someone realizing how blind they were about how evil some stuff in ME is
[7:59:09] <Irishgamerlawd> MGS4 is timeless fite me
[7:59:15] <DianaTheAscian> its older than anyone here thats for sure
[7:59:15] <TonberryLives> Chrono Trigger
[7:59:19] <Siconia> 1949 specifically
[7:59:21] <%QueequegTheater> Meh, I don't really mind when something is a product of its time.  I love 80s action movies even though I was born in 1993
[7:59:25] <%GingaNZ> Whats pat doing here?
[7:59:25] <HeroToxiko> it helped to have the bad guy be a coyote who are assholes irl
[7:59:29] <+Shackle_Rustyford> where do i start playing RE
[7:59:29] <Jaysky> Yep
[7:59:35] <%Monkeyweed21> MGS4 is even more nonsense if you weren't alive for the Iraqi war
[7:59:38] <%spoiledbadger> I'd believe it
[7:59:40] <peachy996> ehhhhhhhhhhh
[7:59:42] <dd44dostivei> it looks way better than undertale
[7:59:42] <DianaTheAscian> Yes
[7:59:43] <Explodincatz> no it wouldnt
[7:59:43] <peachy996> hhhhhhh
[7:59:44] <peachy996> hhhhhh
[7:59:50] <%Mr_Pylon> people would be losing it about dual and triple techs'
[7:59:51] <Daniel_Is_I> Not sure it'd blow up the planet
[7:59:51] <peachy996> I dunno
[7:59:51] <%s1rcuit> Chrono Trigger ages like wine
[7:59:52] <+Zambambo> pat isn't it like 3am?
[7:59:55] <Daniel_Is_I> It'd be praised
[7:59:55] <+pre10cious_1> #cancelPepeLePew
[7:59:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I'm of the unpopular opinion that Blazing Saddles is timeless
[7:59:56] <Jaysky> Wouldn't be nearly as popular though
[8:00:07] <%Monkeyweed21> people would shit on Chrono for having no personality
[8:00:16] <%Xelhesia> one piece berserk slam dunk and vagabond
[8:00:25] <%CopperTucker> @QueequegTheater Agreed tbh
[8:00:25] <SilverWolfX9> @queequegtheater it should be timeless. but it's subject matter can be too hot of a topic right now
[8:00:25] <%Andrizzleton> couvre feu is curfew for covid i assume
[8:00:27] <$lotharrio> Dual techs, and the time travel elements would, barring CT's previous existence, would definitely be huge.
[8:00:28] <Jaysky> Love Mordin
[8:00:29] <+thecosmicfly> But would people want to fuck the characters of Chrono Trigger as much as Undertale?
[8:00:30] <Blank9> yeahhhh
[8:00:31] <dd44dostivei> @QueequegTheater Boondocks is way wilder
[8:00:33] <peachy996> Wrex and Mordin are great
[8:00:44] <%SWFanatic> and mirandas ass
[8:00:51] <Irishgamerlawd> they hate him for he speaks the truth
[8:00:52] <Daniel_Is_I> "Had to be me. Someone else would have gotten it wrong."
[8:00:57] <+pre10cious_1> u said Jack wrong
[8:01:00] <%QueequegTheater> I AM THE VERY MODEL OF A SCIENTIST SALARIAN
[8:01:01] <stantheman_97> understandable
[8:01:02] <Jaysky> Listening to Mordin permanently messed with my way of speaking
[8:01:02] <%CopperTucker> @PatStaresAt it is a crime that we don't get Mordin and Patok Wiks together
[8:01:05] <peachy996> Mordin has to be escorted out of the Suicide Mission or he dies though
[8:01:06] <%Monkeyweed21> LEGION IS THE BEST
[8:01:07] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[8:01:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> Respect. Mordin is the best.
[8:01:18] <Broken_Sonex> @pre10cious_1 Jack is a tryhard
[8:01:19] <%Xelhesia> lol
[8:01:23] <peachy996> Padok Wiks is a good guy too
[8:01:24] <%YakumoYomi> @thecosmicfly Definitely Ayla. People love Toriyama's curly-haired girls
[8:01:27] <Irishgamerlawd> Mordin feels more alive than shep tbh
[8:01:28] <+enigmaticgear> what do you think about each class?
[8:01:28] <$Futurecity10> I've never punched her
[8:01:29] <stantheman_97> for me it's wrex then garrus or maybe legion
[8:01:31] <GiefHoward> khalisah bint sinan al jilani
[8:01:34] <peachy996> Khalisa
[8:01:34] <%QueequegTheater> Khalisa bint Sinan al-Jilana
[8:01:35] <HeroToxiko> she was a real life reporter ye
[8:01:36] <+DarkOnyx7> Khalisah
[8:01:36] <%Canti510> Al Jahlani
[8:01:39] <%QueequegTheater> *Jilani
[8:01:39] <aiutare47> I mixed here up with the other one
[8:01:42] <%X2Eliah> Why are people so hung up on that punching thing
[8:01:43] <aiutare47> they look identical
[8:01:44] <DefaultSettiings> Mordin warned me how stupid it was to fuck Tali, but he approved my choice to do so
[8:01:44] <%DJFakie> Khalisah Bint Sinan al-Jilani
[8:01:47] <peachy996> Khalisa Ben Singnan Al Jilani
[8:01:48] <dd44dostivei> khalisa bin sinan al-jilani
[8:02:06] <Irishgamerlawd> abu nazir
[8:02:06] <+pre10cious_1> Rahs Al Ghoul?
[8:02:06] <lloyddboy> SEE-nan
[8:02:08] <%CopperTucker> it's way more satisfying to call her out
[8:02:08] <%DJFakie> Paragon-ing her is actually way better because you verbally tear her arguments down
[8:02:15] <Broken_Sonex> Why does she have such a fucked name?
[8:02:16] <buhbuhboat> i've had enough of your disingenuous assertions
[8:02:23] <peachy996> I punch her until 3
[8:02:25] <Virokwet> yup
[8:02:28] <%YakumoYomi> I did it once, and then afterwards found it more satisfying to "convert" her to your side in ME3
[8:02:32] <peachy996> In 3 she's probably more human
[8:02:32] <%QueequegTheater> I've had enough of your snide insinuations
[8:02:33] <+hananafell> "I just got bullrushed on my own show, just great"
[8:02:35] <$lotharrio> I held back on punching her until 3.
[8:02:38] <%X2Eliah> yEAH
[8:02:41] <%Canti510> She even says "Sandbagged on my own show. Wonderful"
[8:02:43] <HeroToxiko> the paragon option leads to a romance thing too LUL
[8:02:44] <peachy996> Because she's angry no one is doing anything about Earth
[8:02:45] <%QueequegTheater> @Broken_Sonex it's a Middle Eastern name
[8:02:46] <%Canti510> When you do the Paragon
[8:02:47] <SilverWolfX9> it's there an option to shit your diaper, have her win
[8:02:50] <lloyddboy> in 3 it's revealed she gets punched a LOT
[8:02:51] <%X2Eliah> I really wonder, do many people just play renegade by default?
[8:02:54] <DefaultSettiings> what was the name of that reporter we keep locked in the basement of the the ship in 3
[8:02:55] <HeroToxiko> so i guess she's just into humiliation
[8:02:58] <SaphronBlackbourne> Ehhh punching si more fun to me
[8:03:06] <Irishgamerlawd> Hi I'm commander Sheppard and I approve of this stream
[8:03:11] <+thecosmicfly> @DefaultSettiings Jessica Chobot
[8:03:15] <peachy996> @DefaultSettiings Allers
[8:03:19] <%scaryboisupreme> oh here we go
[8:03:19] <%YakumoYomi> @DefaultSettiings The one based on Chobot?
[8:03:23] <Irishgamerlawd> thanks for making the morning less boring
[8:03:24] <+hananafell> Woooo propaganda
[8:03:31] <TonberryLives> Copaganda
[8:03:34] <%scaryboisupreme> this is gonna be embarassing
[8:03:36] <HeroToxiko> we call that "coppaganda"
[8:03:42] <%QueequegTheater> @DefaultSettiings Diana Allers
[8:03:44] <%GarbageNirvana> I still wonder, did they do a really fucked up job modeling her or is that just what Jessica Chobot looks like
[8:03:44] <muXPerience> muxperBusta with the takes
[8:03:50] <Dunmarkh> There's a fucking ongoing robot uprising for the militaries to go shoot
[8:03:52] <+pre10cious_1> Thoughts on the Mako?
[8:03:59] <%SWFanatic> just the random bad super cops who want to eradicate all life from the universe
[8:04:04] <guiltyboya> Pat has good takes
[8:04:11] <%Monkeyweed21> except with Police the consequences of total scum are way worse
[8:04:12] <HeroToxiko> like that time he totally screws up a dozen cases by doin g the job wrong
[8:04:13] <aiutare47> when Humans think they are constantly at risk of dying like they think in ME it makes a bit more sense that the Alliance is cool
[8:04:22] <%CopperTucker> he's a good character but a really bad cop
[8:04:22] <Irishgamerlawd> gruff but unlovable
[8:04:22] <peachy996> @GarbageNirvana I'll put it up to bad modelling since Stravohsky looks dicey sometimes
[8:04:23] <FirewallStorm> good takes
[8:04:24] <Shade075> Even the police themed power rangers season spd has currupt super cops
[8:04:26] <%QueequegTheater> It's why SVU was so good
[8:04:29] <HeroToxiko> like a decade worth of cases
[8:04:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Like I know that sounds like a fucked up thing to say but Allers looks like she's got more botox than face
[8:04:56] <peachy996> I always call her Melty Face Allers
[8:05:03] <aiutare47> all of the governments are bad
[8:05:04] <HeroToxiko> they cause the krogans and then do the other thing LUL
[8:05:10] <%YakumoYomi> @GarbageNirvana Her modelling was fucked, I think. Jessica Chobot looks a lot better than her in-game equivalent
[8:05:13] <dd44dostivei> batarians exist for safe racism
[8:05:15] <Irishgamerlawd> It speaks true to the burnout in those jobs though. .makes sure it never leaves
[8:05:19] <%dekkitout> Everyone seems evil- except the hanar and keepers
[8:05:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Mm'k then
[8:05:29] <peachy996> The Asari are assholes in 3
[8:05:34] <guiltyboya> "Jeez, those aliens are worse than us?!!"
[8:05:35] <$lotharrio> The Genophage is a nightmare. Causes like what... 80% stillbirths?
[8:05:38] <%X2Eliah> Hanar are doing kinda bad stuff with the Drell
[8:05:39] <%Order_of_Mystery> Salarian dalatress in 3 tries to guilt you into fucking over the krogan in exchange for her fleets.
[8:05:42] <%Order_of_Mystery> scumbags
[8:05:43] <peachy996> You find out in 3 how much the asari are assholes
[8:05:44] <Zalapski> turians implemented the genophage
[8:05:50] <HeroToxiko> space groomers LUL
[8:05:52] <%Mr_Pylon> The Hanar tried to help those reptile guys
[8:05:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @lotharrio 99.99 %
[8:05:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Counterpoint: Samara hits every one of my mommy fetishes
[8:05:57] <Zulrez> the elchor are cool
[8:05:58] <+thecosmicfly> Everyone loves Elcors
[8:06:02] <stantheman_97> the elcor are the only good ones
[8:06:03] <%s1rcuit> now tell us the horrible history of the Elcor
[8:06:03] <+DarkOnyx7> The Elcor are good boys
[8:06:03] <peachy996> Fuck that Dalatrass, the STG help you anyway.
[8:06:03] <dd44dostivei> vorcha...
[8:06:04] <Broken_Sonex> Every race has got dirt, i like that, every body got a skeleton in the closet
[8:06:04] <%blutzwavedave> Only the reapers are good, uh oh
[8:06:05] <Irishgamerlawd> Elcor hench bois
[8:06:06] <aiutare47> Asaris are manipulative power hungry rulers, Turians are facists that would exterminate other life if they could, Salarians, Quarrians.
[8:06:07] <Zalapski> quarians are genocidal
[8:06:07] <HeroToxiko> "what do you look like" "i look how you want me to look"
[8:06:08] <+GuilKato> can asarii bang the keepers?
[8:06:10] <%Order_of_Mystery> The elcor are pure
[8:06:15] <%QueequegTheater> They are
[8:06:15] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[8:06:16] <+hananafell> Turians were justified, humans almost restarted the Rachni wars on accident
[8:06:17] <Jaysky> Gratitude. Elchor are good people.
[8:06:18] <peachy996> Save Kirrahe and the STG are behind you in 3
[8:06:19] <muXPerience> <smug tone> we know
[8:06:20] <stantheman_97> slow and steady
[8:06:21] <aiutare47> they are
[8:06:21] <+AFellowDegen> volus are the comedic relief of the galaxy
[8:06:22] <$Futurecity10> Vore-CHA
[8:06:22] <%QueequegTheater> VorCHA
[8:06:26] <%X2Eliah> ... yeah
[8:06:27] <lloyddboy> giorno goblins
[8:06:28] <$lotharrio> @Monkeyweed21 Ugh, even if they have like a dozen kids at a time that's fucking hreatbreaking to consider.
[8:06:28] <%X2Eliah> xD
[8:06:30] <aiutare47> Vorcha are just evil
[8:06:33] <%QueequegTheater> 15 years
[8:06:35] <peachy996> The Vorcha are regarded as a pest
[8:06:37] <%YakumoYomi> =tentatively excited= The elcor are indeed rad
[8:06:39] <%DJFakie> MaleShep voices the Vorcha.
[8:06:47] <dd44dostivei> krogan complain about them shitting on floor almost as much as varren
[8:06:52] <peachy996> And yet they have a air force in 3
[8:06:54] <$lotharrio> The Vorcha were introduced just so you could kill something and be like, "no big loss, we're probably better off."
[8:06:55] <SilverWolfX9> vorcha have a 20 year lifespans
[8:07:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @lotharrio its literally 1 in 1000 birth  rate
[8:07:03] <HeroToxiko> what was the super peaceful race who look super evil?
[8:07:05] <%Mr_Pylon> Am I remembering right that the Hanar are the only reason why the Drell still exist?
[8:07:15] <$Futurecity10> You mean multiplayer?
[8:07:19] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I feel like most people actually misremember Ashley's bear hunting analogy
[8:07:20] <aiutare47> ME3 multiplayer kinda?
[8:07:20] <+Shackle_Rustyford> there wont be a next
[8:07:20] <$Futurecity10> Where you could be a volus
[8:07:23] <Virokwet> imagine
[8:07:24] <%DJFakie> Garrus Space Cop game
[8:07:25] <%Xelhesia> thatd be great
[8:07:25] <+DarkOnyx7> ME3 multiplayer helped scratch that itch
[8:07:28] <stantheman_97> i would be instantly sold
[8:07:28] <peachy996> I wanted that for Andromeda and they didn't give it to us
[8:07:29] <%spoiledbadger> Like a bethesda game
[8:07:29] <%Axellogic> God if I could play as a fucking Krogan
[8:07:29] <dd44dostivei> way too limiting
[8:07:29] <%SWFanatic> ME3 MP was so good
[8:07:30] <%blutzwavedave> Turian all day
[8:07:33] <%X2Eliah> Well they have the tech for it
[8:07:33] <+thecosmicfly> Volus Spectre lets go
[8:07:33] <%UvBenServed> Mass Effect Online
[8:07:33] <Irishgamerlawd> starting planets woah
[8:07:36] <%dekkitout> Pat, that's a lot of work and you know folks hate that in 2021
[8:07:36] <%Xelhesia> yup
[8:07:36] <HeroToxiko> yup
[8:07:37] <%spoiledbadger> yeah
[8:07:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> at the very least they're teasing Liara as playable.
[8:07:39] <ScrubTheNerd> Yeah
[8:07:39] <+AceNugget> elcore/hannar buddy cop duo
[8:07:39] <Virokwet> Multiplayer lets you pick a class not a race
[8:07:40] <stantheman_97> LET ME BE A ELCOR
[8:07:40] <%YakumoYomi> Yep
[8:07:42] <+RAWPowerStudios> No that's a cop-out you need an alien race perspective where you can hate on humans.
[8:07:43] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA JUST REMOVE THE HUMANS ENTIRELY
[8:07:43] <Siconia> Yessir
[8:07:43] <Profmcstevie> I'd shit at all the writing that would entail
[8:07:44] <Daniel_Is_I> The only good one? Yes
[8:07:46] <peachy996> Imagine playing as one of the four pathfinders instead of dumb Ryder
[8:07:47] <%X2Eliah> Inquisition too
[8:07:48] <+Shackle_Rustyford> they wont
[8:07:48] <%barrakuta371> I would go Quarian despite all the issues of bring Quarian
[8:07:49] <guiltyboya> If only ME:Andromeda was that instead of a complete disgrace
[8:07:49] <aiutare47> and almost all the backgrounds are cool
[8:07:50] <%Xelhesia> still the best da
[8:07:51] <Jaysky> But then how could humanity be the main character?
[8:07:51] <+kortin> I watched a 2 and a half hour review of the Dragon Age series today ariyanaLUL
[8:07:52] <%Axellogic> LET ME BE A KROGAN VANGAURD IN SINGLE PLAYER
[8:07:53] <+HefestoForges> elcor would punch shit
[8:07:55] <chamblers> would to kill to play as a hanar with a submachine gun
[8:07:55] <%dekkitout> Bold
[8:07:55] <Khester824> please don't just shit love on stream during the next mass effect reveal
[8:07:55] <Zombrocom> Ah yes the good dragon age
[8:07:55] <HeroToxiko> im still mad kieran wasn't a half black elf child
[8:07:55] <Zalapski> the codex says that the salarians intended genophage to be a deterrent to end war with krogans and turians said 'nah, that won't fucking work' and spread it to all krogan worlds -- both races are very bad
[8:07:56] <%SWFanatic> volus
[8:07:59] <GiefHoward> play as a keeper
[8:07:59] <%SWFanatic> hanar
[8:08:00] <+Shackle_Rustyford> 3 races are human, human and human
[8:08:00] <+GhostDude> Pat, what about the volus
[8:08:00] <+mundanelotus> cowards for not doing it in Andromeda
[8:08:00] <Irishgamerlawd> worked smashingly
[8:08:03] <%spoiledbadger> not asari?
[8:08:04] <+hananafell> Asari would be easier than krogan
[8:08:05] <peachy996> Asari and Salarian too
[8:08:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Salarian tho
[8:08:06] <%SWFanatic> geth
[8:08:06] <%YakumoYomi> @Axellogic Preach!
[8:08:07] <%POUND_CAKE94> I remember it more than Jade Empire
[8:08:09] <Fictionnaire> You have to have asari.
[8:08:11] <$Futurecity10> ME3 multiplayer let you play as an Awakened Collector
[8:08:12] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt ME3 MP let us play every race
[8:08:13] <+thecosmicfly> Human, Turian, and Elcor
[8:08:14] <%Mr_Pylon> Drell
[8:08:14] <CatsDrunkonCopper> human, elcor and hanar
[8:08:14] <DefaultSettiings> let me be a Quarian and have unique Game Over for being sneezed on
[8:08:15] <Shade075> and elcor
[8:08:18] <%QueequegTheater> cheer500 No spoilers but I feel like a lot of people online actually misremember Ashley's bear hunting analogy
[8:08:19] <SilverWolfX9> AND GETH?!
[8:08:22] <%spoiledbadger> i would love to be a geth!
[8:08:24] <Siconia> GIVE THING
[8:08:24] <Irishgamerlawd> elcor minigame
[8:08:25] <Zulrez> playable elchor when
[8:08:26] <%dekkitout> Even if it sucks? tajRLY
[8:08:30] <+HefestoForges> geth shepard would be fun
[8:08:32] <$lotharrio> Do we even know what the canon ending is now?
[8:08:32] <stantheman_97> i want to be a living bio tank
[8:08:33] <Zombrocom> Geth! Yes.
[8:08:34] <%SkyfireHero> Volus Pat needs to exist
[8:08:38] <ethey16> mass effect MMO?
[8:08:39] <Shade075> playable Geth would be great
[8:08:40] <%QueequegTheater> HE IS A GOOD BOY
[8:08:41] <%Xelhesia> yup
[8:08:42] <+mundanelotus> ME3 let u play as other races on the multiplayer
[8:08:43] <%DJFakie> Ooooh we're playing all of them!
[8:08:46] <%POUND_CAKE94> All the multiplayer classes but more
[8:08:47] <%SWFanatic> ME3 MP had the geth prime as playable
[8:08:48] <+Spenny_YO> I wanna play as a Reaper
[8:08:49] <SFTengu> I MISS HIM
[8:08:49] <+GuilKato> Elcor doing a dramatic speech "majestically You can do it."
[8:08:50] <peachy996> Oh you'll get LOTS of complaining if you decide to play 3
[8:08:51] <%scaryboisupreme> Maaaaaaaaaan, the original intro of ME2 is SOOOOOOO much better
[8:08:52] <%Monkeyweed21> LEGION IS THE BEST
[8:08:53] <%s1rcuit> @QueequegTheater about how you sic the dog on the bear and run away?
[8:08:55] <$Futurecity10> Cant you play as a geth in ME3?
[8:08:57] <%QueequegTheater> WHAT
[8:08:57] <%dekkitout> Is the Geth not Ethan from CoD?
[8:09:00] <peachy996> I'll complain LOTS if you play 3
[8:09:01] <%Order_of_Mystery> Playable Geth... Juggernaut.
[8:09:02] <%Arancet> oh really?
[8:09:02] <RushUnplugged> there's really no context where comparing sapient aliens to a dog makes Ashley not awful
[8:09:05] <%scaryboisupreme> LEGION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE FIRST SQUAD MATE
[8:09:07] <Zombrocom> Wait, Legion is great
[8:09:08] <%Order_of_Mystery> Be the biggest robot
[8:09:09] <Shade075> WAT??????
[8:09:12] <+RAWPowerStudios> Allowing human as a character option would warp the dialogue. We need full hate on humans.
[8:09:20] <VectMachine> Remember how Legion is voiced by Albert Wesker's VA?
[8:09:23] <%Order_of_Mystery> WHAT
[8:09:25] <guiltyboya> For real? Damn
[8:09:28] <stantheman_97> REALLY?!
[8:09:28] <chamblers> WHAT
[8:09:29] <%QueequegTheater> @s1rcuit she's not saying they're subhuman, she's saying the aliens are the hunter
[8:09:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> WHY DID THEY CUT
[8:09:30] <%animaturgy> That would have been rad as fuck
[8:09:31] <%X2Eliah> OHHHH
[8:09:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> WHAT
[8:09:32] <%dekkitout> Dang
[8:09:32] <%spoiledbadger> like kotor 2 intro?
[8:09:32] <peachy996> Legion has lines as early as Mordin's chapter
[8:09:33] <%scaryboisupreme> IT'S NOT FAIR
[8:09:33] <+hananafell> THATD BE RAD
[8:09:33] <%X2Eliah> Dang
[8:09:33] <$lotharrio> Oh that would have fucking made the game awesome.
[8:09:34] <stantheman_97> FUCK
[8:09:34] <%Order_of_Mystery> NOOOOOOOOOO
[8:09:34] <Zombrocom> ...Wat
[8:09:35] <%Mr_Pylon> Legion as #1 would have been so sick
[8:09:35] <+HefestoForges> fuck that noise
[8:09:35] <CurrentQuiet> that would have been RAD
[8:09:37] <%CopperTucker> WHAT
[8:09:39] <HeroToxiko> they did the tell now show thing LUL
[8:09:40] <Zombrocom> THAT SOUNDS AWESOME
[8:09:40] <dd44dostivei> WHY WOULD YOU TELL US THIS
[8:09:41] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA LEGION IS THE ONE THAT SAVES YOUR BODY
[8:09:42] <%DJFakie> Dead last, super easy to miss his loyalty
[8:09:45] <%Arancet> oh fuck off ea
[8:09:47] <+thecosmicfly> COWARDS
[8:09:48] <%SWFanatic> meh
[8:09:50] <Shade075> OH FUCK THAT
[8:09:52] <%scaryboisupreme> oh fuck off
[8:09:53] <%dekkitout> Who starts a franchise at 2?
[8:09:53] <Zombrocom> GOD DAMN IT
[8:09:53] <+Nephilim895> take a chance on weird
[8:09:54] <Virokwet> Im too biased in favor of the ME2 we got to care....
[8:09:54] <peachy996> Like he still has voice lines if you bring him to Mordin's Plague Ward
[8:09:55] <$lotharrio> So players with no fucking context?
[8:09:57] <%Xelhesia> that still makes no sense
[8:09:57] <%X2Eliah> You can get Legion in like 40% in if you rush to him
[8:10:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> WE ALMOST HAD A HALO 2 SCENARIO FLIP AND THEY BITCHED OUT!!!
[8:10:01] <chamblers> THAT WOULD BE SO COOL
[8:10:01] <stantheman_97> THAT FUCKING RAD I HATE IT
[8:10:02] <%SkyfireHero> back when it was the geth resurrection
[8:10:05] <%DJFakie> Thoughts on Kasumi
[8:10:06] <%scaryboisupreme> Cause if you do, the whole ship dies!
[8:10:10] <%Order_of_Mystery> bioware you god damned cowards I am angry
[8:10:14] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You can take him on them technically but it fucks up your ending
[8:10:18] <filialpails> the anti-MGS2
[8:10:18] <aiutare47> YEAH
[8:10:19] <%Xelhesia> got to
[8:10:20] <HeroToxiko> Yeah, get her ass
[8:10:23] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[8:10:24] <peachy996> Oh yeah that's a great one
[8:10:25] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[8:10:27] <Virokwet> ... damn
[8:10:28] <+hananafell> You can technically take him on any loyalty mission if you time it right, you just cant do all of them in 1 run
[8:10:28] <%QueequegTheater> It fucks up your ending tho
[8:10:31] <Jaysky> Oh god I remember it
[8:10:31] <$lotharrio> I did that and got half of the Normandy crew killed... probably worth it.
[8:10:34] <peachy996> Just show up at gunpoint
[8:10:34] <Zalapski> DAMN RIGHT
[8:10:34] <guiltyboya> If you know what I mean
[8:10:34] <%scaryboisupreme> but pat if you do even a single mission after you get legion, the whole normandy crew dies
[8:10:42] <%POUND_CAKE94> Walk in the room like OH FUCK
[8:10:47] <CurrentQuiet> I think I had legion and tali as my my 2 crewmember for most of the game
[8:10:48] <+kuzenbozz> ill never forgive ME3 for not letting me romance EDI
[8:10:49] <+thecosmicfly> Not true
[8:10:50] <%X2Eliah> There's not much actual downside to doing the IFF mission asap
[8:10:51] <Zombrocom> Aren't you allowed to do one mission after legion?
[8:10:52] <Zalapski> shove that shit right in those uppity quarians' faces
[8:10:52] <+Toaderator> you can do 1
[8:10:54] <DefaultSettiings> you're gonna guarantee at least 1 death doing that
[8:10:55] <peachy996> @QueequegTheater Eh only Kelly dies if you do it right
[8:10:57] <%SirGO0SE> I don't think Paige is winning that bet
[8:10:59] <%scaryboisupreme> well yeah his loyalty mission
[8:10:59] <%X2Eliah> You get 1
[8:11:01] <+hananafell> @scaryboisupreme Theres a buffer if you have missions left
[8:11:01] <SilverWolfX9> what causes full crew death?
[8:11:03] <%X2Eliah> You get 1 free
[8:11:08] <Jaysky> My crew all died.
[8:11:10] <%Mr_Pylon> Eh, they ain't important
[8:11:11] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Its actually 2. After getting the IFF you get 2 missions
[8:11:11] <+AFellowDegen> u an do 2
[8:11:24] <Irishgamerlawd> could always save scum 👀
[8:11:25] <$lotharrio> I think it's 3?
[8:11:25] <+AFellowDegen> its 2
[8:11:31] <%scaryboisupreme> If you do 2 half the crew dies
[8:11:32] <$lotharrio> Doing 2 kills half the crew.
[8:11:37] <guiltyboya> psaDogchamp
[8:11:40] <%QueequegTheater> Wait did they change it for Legendary?
[8:11:43] <peachy996> Even if you screw up Chambers death goes by unnoticed anyway
[8:11:51] <%X2Eliah> Who cares about the crew xD
[8:11:53] <Zombrocom> I thought it was 1
[8:11:55] <%QueequegTheater> Fair enough
[8:11:55] <%DJFakie> Fair
[8:11:57] <guiltyboya> REJECTED
[8:12:04] <%Reveresao> orbman
[8:12:04] <%dekkitout> Lives on the moon
[8:12:04] <ammobasket> True
[8:12:06] <Siconia> LUL
[8:12:09] <Siconia> Fuckin owned
[8:12:10] <%scaryboisupreme> Unless you go straight to the collector base right after legion's loyalty mission, half of them get juiced
[8:12:10] <Jontman42> why not
[8:12:11] <HeroToxiko> some parasocial shit LUL
[8:12:12] <$lotharrio> Work until you die, internet man!
[8:12:12] <$Futurecity10> Getting the IFF you get 2 missions before the crew gets captured, then you have 2 missions before all the crew is dead
[8:12:16] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Parasocial relationships, man
[8:12:17] <%Xelhesia> invasive much
[8:12:18] <peachy996> Tell me your secrets, Streamer
[8:12:23] <Jaysky> @X2Eliah I cared about the speaker lady, but thats about all who I cared about
[8:12:25] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat's retirement plan is to become a robot
[8:12:26] <+AceNugget> 80 yo stemer widepeepohappy
[8:12:29] <DefaultSettiings> reminder: Joker could legit shatter his pelvis trying to take a dump
[8:12:34] <CurrentQuiet> but my very real and important paradoxical relationship???
[8:12:41] <CurrentQuiet> parasocial*
[8:12:46] <%QueequegTheater> Pat never makes disingenuous assertions about Yakuza 6 Kappa
[8:12:52] <%barrakuta371> Retiring on the moon makes sense, the lower gravity will be easier on my old bones. Never mind the lack of atmosphere.
[8:12:54] <CurrentQuiet> also /s
[8:13:00] <%SWFanatic> Ty for the stream. Good night
[8:13:01] <+hananafell> One mission after capture kills half the crew and a few named characters, Two missions kills EVERYONE except Chakwas
[8:13:08] <%Andrizzleton> dante just takes me out of it too much LUL
[8:13:08] <Siconia> Hey, donator man, congrats, I'm including your message as an example in my dissertation about parasocial relationships LUL
[8:13:10] <MusouMiko> Raidou is also simply stronger than Dante because he gets phys pierce
[8:13:11] <+AceNugget> @scaryboisupreme If he ever becomes a toilet it's our job to make sure he's installed on a clean space station
[8:13:11] <%Xelhesia> raidou needs a new game :(
[8:13:16] <guiltyboya> "Another one god rejected"
[8:13:21] <dongy14> did anyone clip when dog was barking at gun?
[8:13:31] <SilverWolfX9> i hope they port avatar tuner and the raidou games
[8:13:33] <%X2Eliah> And no dlc install bullshit
[8:13:35] <%MisterRockett> Dante is literally doing nothing for large stretches of time canonically xD
[8:13:41] <%YakumoYomi> New players think Matador is rough...and I'm giggling at the thought of them getting to Mot
[8:13:49] <%DJFakie> It really needed the cleanup but it's definitely better now
[8:13:59] <+AFellowDegen> The Mako still sucks ass though
[8:14:02] <dd44dostivei> crazy how good 2 looks
[8:14:03] <$Futurecity10> Playing ME3 legit brings down my mood
[8:14:06] <peachy996> Looking to see how well the Thresher Maw fights improved
[8:14:09] <guiltyboya> Woohoo pizza yolo Dante in 3/4/5 is so precious
[8:14:11] <%allups> Good night Pat
[8:14:20] <%QueequegTheater> Not you
[8:14:21] <%Monkeyweed21> its so white
[8:14:21] <%DJFakie> Damn, got mispronounced twice BibleThump
[8:14:24] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt So Pat is next week all mass effect week?
[8:14:26] <%QueequegTheater> But a lot of people
[8:14:58] <$lotharrio> Ashley is just a bit too racist for me to keep her alive.
[8:14:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Futurecity10 I wanna be excited, and I'm tempted to get it, but yeah... god that ending really suck.
[8:15:02] <Irishgamerlawd> skeptics gonna skep
[8:15:04] <peachy996> Bah people make Ash out to be a Klansman sometimes
[8:15:11] <%UvBenServed> So projection
[8:15:13] <Profmcstevie> "everyone thinks like I do"
[8:15:13] <Dunmarkh> she does call them animals on the citadel tho.
[8:15:14] <HeroToxiko> "i have to be racist because they're obviously racist right"
[8:15:18] <%blutzwavedave> Thanks, Pat!
[8:15:18] <TonberryLives> Oh, so projection
[8:15:19] <%Xelhesia> thats y we kill ashley
[8:15:24] <Shade075> Ashley worst girl
[8:15:25] <%DJFakie> Good night Pat!
[8:15:26] <Siconia> Max is
[8:15:27] <%Monkeyweed21> max is doing vf5
[8:15:29] <guiltyboya> Litterally racist mentality
[8:15:30] <Broken_Sonex> Her endurance is max in DE
[8:15:35] <%AzureGale> Good night and rest well
[8:15:38] <Siconia> Hell yeah
[8:15:39] <%QueequegTheater> @Dunmarkh that's a bug, she's only supposed to say that about the Keepers
[8:15:40] <+red_cuppa> <3
[8:15:48] <Jaysky> I think most of the missions in ME3 are fantastic aside from the asari mission, but yes the last 10 minutes are bad.
[8:15:48] <peachy996> Remember to save Ash for later so you can shoot her in 3 Pat
[8:15:50] <ammobasket> lets goooooo
[8:15:59] <%MisterRockett> The fact that it's not skipping the PS4 is really funny.
[8:16:00] <Dunmarkh> @QueequegTheater maybe they should have fixed that in the remaster
[8:16:02] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Ashley is also proven 100% right in 3
[8:16:07] <peachy996> It's way better than letting her die with honor in 1
[8:16:12] <%X2Eliah> Pat Rolls Back
[8:16:13] <%QueequegTheater> Because that is LITERALLY what the other species do
[8:16:13] <%MisterRockett> 24 Hours Till Free VF5!
[8:16:24] <RushUnplugged> Ash sucks and you look bad defending her
[8:16:32] <Siconia> Take what you can get I guess?
[8:16:35] <dashmatt> Great stream, Pat! G'night!
[8:16:38] <Profmcstevie> I'll eat the soggy bread of VF5 then.....
