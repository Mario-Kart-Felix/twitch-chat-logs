[0:25:41] <%kiiiirsten> He wasn't worried, but he probably should have been
[0:25:41] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You gonna play Lunar Advanced??? For eight decades.
[0:25:42] <%Tyonidus> idk man I seem to remember frequently restarting my pc every few hours of gameplay because the fps would steadily drop over time
[0:25:44] <%PenmanLupine> Pat could just do Dead Money, Honest Hearts and Old World Blues before finishing the game, then do Lonesome Road.
[0:25:45] <%Kahnicus> man, won't be seeing any more legion troops any time soon
[0:25:45] <Worldbrand> blood geyser out of his sunglasses that he's wearing at night
[0:25:47] <%Tyonidus> because of the memory leak thing obv
[0:25:49] <%PenmanLupine> but that's just how I would play it
[0:25:52] <TalisKanju> Why do you have seething hatred for Resident Evil 1? @AngriestPat
[0:26:01] <%kiiiirsten> @Worldbrand Tha'ts the name of my band
[0:26:02] <zafooru> and they dont stop coming and they dont stop coming
[0:26:04] <%ronyncato87> That's wat she said
[0:26:05] <shurtal> And they don't stop coming, and they don't stop coming
[0:26:07] <dekkitout> and they dont stop coming cause they dont stop coming
[0:26:08] <%Johnothon> And they don't stop coming
[0:26:08] <alrobot2014> are you sure?
[0:26:11] <%Kahnicus> i'm actually trying to knock the base game companion quests out before i hit dead money
[0:26:14] <%topendbuzz> yeah?
[0:26:14] <%kiiiirsten> Pat streaming nothing is my favorite so far
[0:26:16] <%OwlLightningMage> It's not like you knew or any of us LUL
[0:26:17] <KangarooCyborg> that is highly doubtful
[0:26:18] <%thewordofhelix> 1

[0:29:01] <FracturedImage> Quarry when???
[0:29:03] <Moisthoodie> how can you tell if a deathclaw is male or female?
[0:29:05] <natebud> You look good, get smoked
[0:29:07] <%NoMoreHero51> currently watching pat stream while watching pats resident evil 2 video while hearing pat on the podcast
[0:29:09] <%Kahnicus> go back to deadwind cavern and play with the legendary deathclaw
[0:29:13] <aiyobro> those guys look alot cooler than the centurions he was fighting
[0:29:19] <zafooru> the female ones have huge honkers
[0:29:20] <Gruhunchously> The alternate route to the Boomers is such bullshit. First there are deathclaws, then there's a Very Hard Locked door, and then there's a tunnel full of mines and Ghoul Reavers. And you STILL have to deal with the bombardment when you get out.
[0:29:23] <CrabSlacks> those were the last of the friendly talking deathclaws :(
[0:29:27] <dekkitout> you can distinguish deathclaws by horns and hide color
[0:29:27] <%PaladinDupre> Try Paciencia
[0:29:28] <Moisthoodie> huge deathclaw honkers
[0:29:28] <%MadSkulll> @FracturedImage i wanna see him clear out the quarry so bad lol
[0:29:32] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Little close.
[0:29:34] <sparkboy777> @AngriestPat TAKE THE EGG for later.
[0:29:39] <Revawo> DEATHCLAW HONKERS
[0:29:40] <%Kahnicus> or go play with the deathclaws at the deathclaw promontory
[0:29:43] <%soycanadiense> bo8CIA
[0:29:48] <%Kahnicus> or quarry ridge
[0:29:48] <KeystoneA1> The lady at Sloan wants it for an omlette
[0:29:52] <sparkboy777> @AngriestPat its for the fight club later in the sewers.
[0:29:54] <%Count_Long> Deathclaw EGg is for the ommelette at Sloan
[0:29:55] <Gruhunchously> @CrabSlacks Nah, the Enclave wiped them all out in Fallout 2, except for Goris.
[0:29:55] <Reckeler> thorn quest is what you need the egg for
[0:29:57] <zafooru> deathclaw egg is for omelett quest north of goodsprings

[0:32:46] <+Noxybaru> boon pls
[0:32:46] <+Gravity_Gunner> Deathclaws like quarries because they're old school Doctor Who fans
[0:32:47] <%OwlLightningMage> The noises get them all porked up
[0:32:48] <Gruhunchously> Did you know that there's an area crawling with Deathclaws on the other side of the Colorado Rive.
[0:32:56] <%Laecerelius> I'm disappointed they didn't have an intelligent deathclaw in this
[0:32:56] <dekkitout> daredevildeathclaw
[0:32:59] <%Kahnicus> this here's the most aggro deathclaw in the world! She' a beaut!
[0:33:00] <coldparty> Picking on the disabled, that's low.
[0:33:00] <satyr_king> That poor deathclaw BibleThump
[0:33:01] <%Jjrossman> poor thing is blind
[0:33:03] <%PaladinDupre> Deafclaw
[0:33:04] <%pillcosby101> apatCaw
[0:33:04] <%TombstoneTTromboners> please stop killing all these poor blind deathclaws pat
[0:33:06] <Maleicus> "where am i going"
[0:33:06] <%TombstoneTTromboners> you sick fuck
[0:33:07] <%Count_Long> I played New Vegas prior to join the AF, and when i got stationed out here, I was hyped cause you know, vidya. Its not nearly as cool as New Vegas.
[0:33:11] <$HentaiSenpai9K> It's a PaigeClaw
[0:33:11] <KeystoneA1> They aren't blind for shit
[0:33:12] <%Tyonidus> Paige Deatchlaws? Kappa
[0:33:12] <FracturedImage> Look at all that FREE XP
[0:33:13] <%TheSpiritof2277> This is pretty sad
[0:33:13] <satyr_king> You cant kill Paiges kid like that Pat
[0:33:16] <%psychodave1234> @coldparty is it a new low though
[0:33:16] <%Count_Long> Primm is shit, goodsprings, shit
[0:33:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> @laecerelius Goris was the best
[0:33:21] <%Count_Long> Nellis, MEGASHIT
[0:33:22] <%PaladinDupre> A Blind Deafclaw named Hell'n Killer
[0:33:22] <%topendbuzz> dont worry about it
[0:33:22] <%Remery_> Lupus?
[0:33:24] <%TombstoneTTromboners> global warming
[0:33:24] <wsintai> "Who's shooting?" - Paigeclaw
[0:33:25] <Gruhunchously> Paige Deathclaws
[0:33:26] <zafooru> they guessed on their glasses prescription
[0:33:27] <+Noxybaru> Regular Vegas is a letdown
[0:33:29] <Weeabooninja> OMG, Pat you can't just ask why they're blind
[0:33:30] <stratfel112> "this is pretty easy" famous last words
[0:33:37] <KRSG> I think there's one behind you.
[0:33:37] <Zalthia> I mean @laecerelius there is only one left, MAYBE
[0:33:40] <%Kahnicus> @Count_Long but you could help the boomers raise the lady of the lake though
[0:33:41] <Parapattern> While not as scary as regular Deathclaws, I'd say blind Deathclaws are much creepier
[0:33:44] <dekkitout> they blinded themselves cause killing was too easy, little did they know, that made them MORE DEADLIER
[0:33:46] <%Count_Long> Yea right
[0:33:48] <grayjammer> Oi'm Diseehbled
[0:33:53] <VeryTricky> the blindness gives them POWER
[0:33:53] <%Laecerelius> I thought that the ending where you save them was the canon?
[0:33:56] <%Count_Long> considering 70 percent of the aircraft piping is ducttape
[0:33:57] <slothslayer828> Disabledclaws
[0:33:59] <%Count_Long> i doubt it would float
[0:34:05] <%psychodave1234> shouldnt any of these shots be a sneak attack? they LITERALLY cannot see you coming
[0:34:05] <natebud> They're like regular deathclaws except they know how to read braile
[0:34:08] <+Bad1uck> They're blind because the eyes are the window to the soul
[0:34:11] <Gruhunchously> This is like, shooting elephants on Safari. Picking blind Deathclaws off from three miles off.
[0:34:12] <+iwasJase> ironsight sniper rifles are doo doo
[0:34:13] <%Kahnicus> float like a rock
[0:34:19] <Zalthia> @laecerelius didn’t they all get wiped out by the enclave though?
[0:34:20] <arcaderabbit48> @psychodave1234 They HEAR and then they SEE
[0:34:22] <Moisthoodie> wow pat killing disabled animals
[0:34:26] <+iwasJase> scopes are the best
[0:34:27] <zafooru> AAAnTS
[0:34:30] <Zalthia> Hang on I need to look this up
[0:34:32] <%lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Bump the difficulty up nerd
[0:34:33] <%TombstoneTTromboners> why was there deathclaws around this building full of ants
[0:34:36] <dekkitout> ants and deathclaws living together WutFace
[0:34:37] <Parapattern> These ants were minding there own gotdamn business
[0:34:37] <stratfel112> god fallout ants freaked me out as a kid
[0:34:40] <%Tyonidus> I did a complete crit/luck/sneak build and the unique bb gun was my favorite weapon in the game because I could one-shot deathclaws with it
[0:34:40] <CrabSlacks> someone left a doughnut under a chair
[0:34:41] <%Laecerelius> You can save them, though that requires a mod since the event was bugged or something like that
[0:34:43] <%psychodave1234> @arcaderabbit48 but they dont see, theyre blind
[0:34:43] <sparkboy777> bless you.
[0:34:44] <%Mikatonic> what're ants doing in my New Vegas?!?!

[0:34:54] <+fatal_penguin_> Use your Demon Summons, Pat
[0:34:56] <seyren86> squidsneeze
[0:34:58] <zafooru> this is the paige zone
[0:34:58] <Estuko> @stratfel112 the cazadores scared me into using the fatman accidentally at close range
[0:35:01] <%Shady_Zaku> Bleesss you
[0:35:01] <%psychodave1234> @arcaderabbit48 oh fuck that daredevil ass shit man
[0:35:05] <seyren86> squidSneeze
[0:35:05] <arcaderabbit48> @psychodave1234 Their Percepption is actually higher than the standard Deathclaw
[0:35:06] <+iwasJase> it's Vegas, before it got nuked it was already a shithole LUL
[0:35:11] <+kevinr220> @count_long lol. Btw you got any advice for joining the AF? Veteran at work told me about becoming a jet engine mechanic and getting trade certified? Been thinking bout it.
[0:35:13] <arcaderabbit48> @psychodave1234 Yyyyyyup!
[0:35:14] <%Remery_> House is a giant ant hill
[0:35:16] <Coystick> I forget were there ants in F4?
[0:35:20] <+PraiseTheSun20> Ed-E's quest always breaks for me
[0:35:20] <%Count_Long> Yea mate
[0:35:20] <majindusto> FUCK THOSE ANTS, JEEZUS!
[0:35:20] <dekkitout> Ed-E, do the thing!
[0:35:21] <PumaOfDarkness> It's like a fucked petting zoo for your gun.
[0:35:22] <KangarooCyborg> I think you have to wait a few days
[0:35:25] <%Kahnicus> You have to take him to places with dialogue triggers pat
[0:35:27] <%Count_Long> just dont cry a lot, its EZ
[0:35:29] <arcaderabbit48> Takes a few days
[0:35:30] <Gruhunchously> Isn't there a timed delay between the first and second time?
[0:35:32] <KRSG> It's triggered at certain areas.
[0:35:34] <%Count_Long> its more mental than anything
[0:35:36] <VeryTricky> is the E-DE you meet in lonesome road the same one?
[0:35:36] <arcaderabbit48> Unlike damn near every other companion
[0:35:37] <natebud> nothing but a star cap in there
[0:35:39] <arcaderabbit48> Its weird
[0:35:41] <%Count_Long> and dont get put in nellis
[0:35:41] <zaptar13> Considering insects populations are in the trillions wouldn't the planet just be absolutely swarmed?
[0:35:41] <Estuko> Or if your brave, your dick
[0:35:49] <Revawo> Different one @VeryTricky
[0:35:49] <ahbhajit> @Coystick ants were in nuka world in f4, iirc
[0:35:50] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat what do you call a Blind Deafclaw? Hell'n Killer
[0:36:00] <%psychodave1234> literally pointless
[0:36:02] <VeryTricky> ah thanks
[0:36:02] <Gruhunchously> Maybe the real New Vegas was the Deathclaws we killed along the way.
[0:36:04] <%Count_Long> Aircraft sucks especially cause you work outdoors.
[0:36:07] <dekkitout> they werent Gi-ants in fo4

[0:37:13] <Radski5> "Is New Vegas falling apart." At all times.
[0:37:13] <Etherealizer> Hey Pat, don't worry about the monitor thing, shit happens. At least New Vegas still works. :)

[0:37:26] <+kevinr220> @count_long Dang. I see. Could I actually choose where to get stationed? Or do they decide for you?
[0:37:30] <+SimplyPandaz> so wait i was gone, whats the deal with the graphics card?
[0:37:37] <stratfel112> that face...
[0:37:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What Fallout game after 2 isn't always falling apart
[0:37:44] <satyr_king> Wait who is this voice actor again?
[0:37:47] <%Count_Long> You get a "Wishlist". Good luck. I listed what are considered the shitest places and they put my in vegas
[0:37:50] <Zalthia> So, the wiki says it’s unclear because the only possible ending for them in 2 was them dying, and they may or may not be able to reproduce. But there was a bugged out good ending for them.
[0:37:59] <%Count_Long> Other people got germany and hawaii
[0:38:00] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat Go to The Thorn first before vault 22! Start Bleed Me Dry!
[0:38:03] <%Count_Long> so its not all bad
[0:38:11] <%Count_Long> and jet fellas can go all over the world
[0:38:14] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat That is a weird notion, from my knowledge the PC uses the graphics card OR the internal gpu, for you to use both would mean you fiddled with the BIOS settings.
[0:38:27] <Gruhunchously> @Breakfast_Megapowers As if Fallout 2 wasn't already coming apart at the seam
[0:38:27] <Chester_goes_Berserk> He took being a pos really well
[0:38:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bullshit! The threat assessment clearly ahould be way higher than initially advertised!

[0:44:13] <%NovaKnightmare> Super Mutants WITH TINY PEEPEES
[0:44:14] <poweredscoot> Eh, could be worse
[0:44:14] <trbrovah> implying you wouldn't want to be a super mutant
[0:44:14] <%OwlLightningMage> The Enclave also wanted to kill everyone that wasn't them LUL
[0:44:15] <zafooru> pat if you became a super mutant you wouldn't have to worry about dying
[0:44:15] <landsharkRAWR> i like how you kinda were walking out into the wilderness and went "oh gotta talk to a scientist" and walked all the way back
[0:44:15] <%Nobrev> the enclave are a bunch of old-government facist bootlickers change my mind
[0:44:15] <%nicos143> But you live forever
[0:44:15] <$Mendin> What, no, the yjust kill people
[0:44:15] <+Noxybaru> Enclave are too caught up in werid pet projects and human purity to be an actual organization for progress of human kind
[0:44:16] <IminyourBase> super mutants are the FUTURE PAT
[0:44:17] <%TheSpiritof2277> They also wanted to cleanse the wasteland in FO2. LITERALLY RACE WARS
[0:44:17] <%psychodave1234> pat youre just wrong again man
[0:44:19] <%Laecerelius> Also a single primitive was all that was required to wipe them out
[0:44:20] <+fatal_penguin_> Wilson Fisk is the best Hope for Humanity
[0:44:20] <+mgskomododragon> Pat over here giving the Wasteland the JFKExperience
[0:44:20] <+TheMattman1313> Yeah but also Arcade Gannon
[0:44:21] <%Daidis> apatWink
[0:44:21] <ahbhajit> enclave kills most of what everyone else considers humanity, dafuq
[0:44:22] <%kiiiirsten> If your entire planet is gonna be super mutated you might as well adapt and become a super mutant
[0:44:23] <%crimsonharvest> Enclave as best hope only works if youre racist enough to buy their genetic purity arguement.
[0:44:24] <KangarooCyborg> BIG AND STRONK
[0:44:24] <$SGrim> @satyr_king your genetals fall off
[0:44:24] <%LogothX> You dont like being a super mutant?
[0:44:24] <%InfinitumImmortalis> is pat saying he wouldn't take that deal?
[0:44:26] <+Flambage> If they turned them into immortal toilets then they might be on to something
[0:44:26] <satyr_king> LUL Pat
[0:44:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> LUL
[0:44:28] <%sparrrow_> Super Chungus Mutants
[0:44:29] <%OwlLightningMage> The Enclave are so bad LUL
[0:44:29] <natebud> They tried to kill literally EVERYONE in D.C.
[0:44:29] <%topendbuzz> thats just evolution man
[0:44:30] <NME_Dom> the chinese nuked the planet
[0:44:30] <+RushUnplugged> dudes, supermutants never fuck anymore
[0:44:30] <zeroraider> Pat don't want you to be SUPER folks
[0:44:30] <%psychodave1234> how could super mutants have tiny weiners, theyre so BIIIIIIIG
[0:44:31] <%Ragnarok_Flames> enclave are rightwwing fucknuts
[0:44:32] <Jkhmn12> I always went independent for this game
[0:44:35] <blankwaffle> you become the hilarious hulk
[0:44:36] <randomp141> @AngriestPat They also make people into Ghouls and Centaurs.
[0:44:36] <satyr_king> @SGrim i dont get laid whats the point
[0:44:37] <%thishere2103> he said to change his mind pat
[0:44:37] <Squidbit> @AngriestPat aren't you always saying you want to be a cyborg?
[0:44:38] <%Real_Todd_Howard> Jacobstown would like a word with you
[0:44:39] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> They...literally want to pollute the water supply? That's...not how hope works???
[0:44:39] <poweredscoot> what if we were all super mutants?
[0:44:43] <Rezignator> they're big and strong and immune to radiation, all upside
[0:44:43] <KRSG> It's the Best Boyz!!!
[0:44:45] <zaptar13> The Enclave did nothing wrong
[0:44:45] <%kiiiirsten> @RushUnplugged That's cause they can't tell who has the bepis and who doesn't
[0:44:46] <HeadsHeldHigh> Have fun with NO GENITALS
[0:44:47] <%Real_Todd_Howard> monkaS
[0:44:48] <%punch_ghost> But Pat what if super mutants lived forever?
[0:44:48] <+shady520> ain't no 4 foot supermutants
[0:44:48] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Don't they become sterile?
[0:44:49] <%Theophilus567> But pat if you were a super mutant you’d get taller and live longer.
[0:44:50] <%valriot> YEEEE
[0:44:50] <$Piemono> Listen if Super Mutants weren't crazy and sterile they'd rule the wastes
[0:44:56] <%king_of_beggars> @AngriestPat The Institute is best chance for humanity except for their random "Let's Nazi all our own robot men" ideas.
[0:44:57] <dekkitout> mind controlled. deathclaws. thats a pretty good deal LUL
[0:45:01] <+AncientToco> Enclave are the only faction that would understand the power of dabbing
[0:45:01] <satyr_king> I bet Brenen Williams voted for Eden
[0:45:02] <%kiiiirsten> if I was a super mutant I'd want to be Lily
[0:45:03] <%SiameseSneeze> GUYS, they also tried to modify the water that would kill any mutants, so counter-productive!
[0:45:04] <+fatal_penguin_> I'm surprised there's not a Redbull mod for this game
[0:45:05] <Zalthia> Whaaaat noooo. Death is our only hope!
[0:45:05] <Radski5> Enclave alongside a group like The Followers or Legion would be best tbh.
[0:45:05] <blankwaffle> ugh
[0:45:08] <%Jjrossman> you feel woozy
[0:45:10] <talkwiththedead> they also are usually CRAZY!?
[0:45:10] <blankwaffle> the worst
[0:45:12] <%punch_ghost> Aren't they immune to death by old age?
[0:45:12] <%Kahnicus> FUCK CAZADORES
[0:45:14] <%Kahnicus> BASTARDS
[0:45:15] <arcaderabbit48> @dekkitout And the Deathclaws could speak! Well, some of them anyway
[0:45:18] <natebud> What is your stance on unique miniguns?
[0:45:19] <%nofestu2> yay
[0:45:20] <+RushUnplugged> SM lose bepis and bagino, they get no fukyfucky anymore
[0:45:22] <%crimsonharvest> Hey how about that grenade rifle now eh its perfect for these fuckers
[0:45:24] <CrabSlacks> Snipe them with explosives
[0:45:25] <$SGrim> @satyr_king the problem is your hormone balance doesn't change, so you get all the pent up aggression of never being able to masturbate, with no way to relieve it.
[0:45:25] <%kiiiirsten> I can't handle all these frames we're getting now, I feel like I have been blessed with rain after a drought
[0:45:25] <valachi> @Ragnarok_Flames I mean if I had to choose between being right wing or having my insides become my outsides because of a super mutant I think I'd rather have my right wing opinions please.
[0:45:25] <%Jjrossman> time for woozy everybody
[0:45:27] <viciousgrim> Enclave have the same ideas as the old word gov right?
[0:45:28] <+zaworldo> hopE YOU brought ANTIVENOM
[0:45:30] <a_mad_dragon> cazadores NotLikeThis
[0:45:31] <Meltgar> @AngriestPat fight those cazadores BARE handed

[0:45:55] <Gruhunchously> Creeping up behind us.
[0:45:55] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat, install Cazeclaws
[0:45:56] <Estuko> I leaned back lmao
[0:45:58] <dekkitout> now i wanna see the less darkest timeline where the institute and enclave teamed up
[0:45:58] <+Punchasaur> AND CUBES
[0:45:58] <+Noxybaru> Enclave is basically "What if the Illuminati were real and survived the apocalypse and were also a little Hitler-y"
[0:45:59] <AlasterAngelo> the Enclave wouldn't let Cazadores exist
[0:45:59] <blankwaffle> close
[0:46:01] <satyr_king> @SGrim can I not just massage my ken doll area? What replaces it?
[0:46:03] <valachi> Pat just shoot the wings
[0:46:04] <%SiameseSneeze> So yeah, fuck the enclave LUL
[0:46:08] <%kiiiirsten> I've never seen new vegas run so smoothly, it's almost like THIS makes the game broken, the unbreaking of it

[0:46:24] <%ramielthe5th> surprise buttsecks
[0:46:26] <+RushUnplugged> Cazadores: Tougher than Deathclaws™
[0:46:27] <dekkitout> if anything the enclave would put cazadores in power armour
[0:46:29] <%Jon64s> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[0:46:33] <Radski5> W O O Z Y
[0:46:34] <dekkitout> which is also cool
[0:46:34] <+mr_zombiefetish> The kings faction is the best hope for humanity. change my mind
[0:46:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Sneaky stab attack at the start of the second tound
[0:46:34] <DanOfHonor> oh FUCK
[0:46:36] <ahbhajit> liking the enclave is weird to me because they literally try to kill you at every opportunity
[0:46:36] <KRSG> @AngriestPat Download Cazaclaws. Do It You Coward!!!!!
[0:46:37] <talkwiththedead> seriously, enclave are only good for looting their stuff
[0:46:37] <jeecay> asshead bugs
[0:46:38] <%Bane_Kaikyo> pew pew pew pew pew
[0:46:39] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat kept the antivenmon this time PogChamp
[0:46:42] <%nofestu2> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[0:46:42] <+Bad1uck> Does explosive items still cripple them really well?
[0:46:44] <%kiiiirsten> @mr_zombiefetish Can't argue with facts
[0:46:46] <satyr_king> @SGrim when you pu it like that I have some issues with this plan LUL
[0:46:50] <%Theophilus567> So. Pat why not ever use semi automatic rifles?
[0:46:54] <blankwaffle> arent cazadores real just obviously not that big
[0:46:58] <Gruhunchously> The Enclave want to kill anyone who isn't them.
[0:46:59] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> The Enclave would make a cazador the president if they could.
[0:47:00] <+fatal_penguin_> Use your Daedric Bow, Pat
[0:47:02] <mr_slaide> Hollow bullets are better for Cazadores.
[0:47:02] <depressedpepega> he just wants to show you his kazador bepis
[0:47:03] <$SGrim> @satyr_king it's a raw fucking deal. rooWut
[0:47:04] <randomp141> @AngriestPat What faction do you think is best for the future in Fallout?
[0:47:05] <talkwiththedead> @owllightningmage he CAN learn! 🕺
[0:47:06] <valachi> @blankwaffle Yeah, they're called Tarantula Hawks
[0:47:08] <%kiiiirsten> Cazador 2020
[0:47:08] <baconlord38> I hate cazadors so much.
[0:47:11] <a_mad_dragon> because he's a filthy coward sniper
[0:47:14] <%Laecerelius> Fucking Cazador bullshit!
[0:47:17] <+Krawzwaka> seriously tough downsides to being a supre mutant? magically become fit af, also no balls to expose on stream
[0:47:17] <+RushUnplugged> yeah it's a giant version of a real bug
[0:47:18] <%SiameseSneeze> Pat was using the Service Rifle a bit when he started the playthrough
[0:47:18] <dekkitout> Hawk Wasp 2240 SeemsGood
[0:47:20] <+mmSoTasty> tarantula hawks are actually pretty chill though
[0:47:23] <%kiiiirsten> Fuck bugs!
[0:47:24] <Gruhunchously> Is this the Counterfiet shack?
[0:47:26] <zafooru> cult of atom is obviously the best
[0:47:26] <natebud> The vice president of the enclave WAS a cazador
[0:47:26] <%Theophilus567> @a_mad_dragon But he’s not using it like a sniper
[0:47:30] <satyr_king> @SGrim crikWow atleast you have muscles
[0:47:34] <talkwiththedead> smoothest framerate ♥️♥️♥️4
[0:47:35] <%valriot> LUL
[0:47:35] <%emillionghost> he's not over it
[0:47:35] <poweredscoot> Cazadores are real and they aren't that big, but you'd think they were if you saw one
[0:47:36] <Estuko> Cazadores are the worst
[0:47:38] <%Real_Todd_Howard> Tarantula hawks have like the second most painful sting on earth
[0:47:39] <%Caidezes> LUL
[0:47:39] <arcaderabbit48> So I just looked up what a Cazaclaw is, and I've never been more turned on in my life
[0:47:41] <+mmSoTasty> they don't have the psychopathic wasp killing instinct unless you're a tarantula
[0:47:42] <VeryTricky> say it
[0:47:42] <+fatal_penguin_> New Vegas runs great on a VooDoo Graphics Cad
[0:47:45] <+fatal_penguin_> Card
[0:47:45] <Estuko> WutFace they're so fast
[0:47:48] <%OwlLightningMage> I love that Pat isn't over it LUL
[0:47:48] <Meltgar> NCR weapons suck
[0:47:51] <stratfel112> Tunnel snakes is the best faction change my mind.
[0:47:52] <$SGrim> @satyr_king but you can get those with drugs that don't knock your dick off rooThink
[0:47:52] <lotharrio> Yeah! Cazadors!
[0:47:52] <mr_slaide> Switch to hollow bullets, nerd.
[0:47:54] <$daveronald> what gpu you running
[0:47:57] <%kiiiirsten> I know the second monitor was the issue but seriously what the fuck was that big glowing framerate death rock?
[0:48:00] <satyr_king> Id like to see Coyote Peterson get stung by one of these things LUL @AngriestPat
[0:48:06] <jeecay> it's time for total bug murder 2019
[0:48:07] <%Theophilus567> Can we start a poll to force pat into downloading cazaclaw?
[0:48:12] <%Daidis> real fake bottlecaps
[0:48:13] <natebud> This is for a caravan mission
[0:48:14] <lotharrio> There's something good in this shack.
[0:48:16] <Gruhunchously> There are skill books in here. Two i think.
[0:48:19] <%hawk_rush> night guys, have fun!
[0:48:22] <zeroraider> REALly fake
[0:48:25] <alrobot2014> @kiiiirsten that was a result of a ghoul overhaul
[0:48:25] <%StooEsq> There's very few combinations of words worse than "Tarantula Hawk Wasp".
[0:48:27] <%crimsonharvest> rifle on the shelf
[0:48:27] <Estuko> FeelsBadMan there was a kid here
[0:48:28] <landsharkRAWR> i like the couriers power to sense what a building is for just by looking at the door
[0:48:30] <%Radski5> Am I a big dick cool guy yet with my emotes n' shit? apatDab
[0:48:30] <CrabSlacks> @AngriestPat Use explosive rounds to snipe cazadors, they move around too much to be easy to hit from far away
[0:48:33] <PabuPanda> Steal all the real fake real caps
[0:48:34] <Kataguro> Cellar Door
[0:48:35] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You already have enough money to own everything in the universe, why more?
[0:48:39] <KRSG> Can't actually Counterfeit. Unless you mod it. Kappa
[0:48:45] <satyr_king> PogChamp MONE
[0:48:47] <Sinister_Aglet> he see
[0:48:48] <%Tyonidus> how do you..."counterfeit"...aluminum bottle caps...
[0:48:50] <%manwithboxonhead> I’m sure making fake bottle caps is incredibly easy.
[0:48:52] <$SGrim> @CrabSlacks shoot at the wings. Easier to hit.
[0:48:58] <%TheSpiritof2277> AH~
[0:48:59] <Reckeler> how do you counterfeit bottle caps exactly
[0:49:01] <dekkitout> @landsharkRAWR when i first heard those words together, nothing cooler could be said, then i googled it...
[0:49:08] <a_mad_dragon> TWO stars
[0:49:12] <Futurecity10> did pat just get fucking TWO stars?
[0:49:13] <%Radski5> With a bottlecap printer NERDS.
[0:49:16] <AlasterAngelo> sunset sarsparilla is filled with caffeine and basically poison
[0:49:17] <+fatal_penguin_> Upgrade to VooDoo Graphics Card, Pat. Your problems will be solved.
[0:49:22] <%Jjrossman> @VeryTricky get out of here you schmuck
[0:49:28] <%kiiiirsten> @Reckeler How many bags are people carrying around to haul their hundreds of bottlecaps
[0:49:28] <Zalthia> It’s wild that there were so many soda bottles that the lids of those bottles can be used as currency
[0:49:29] <satyr_king> @AlasterAngelo its tasty tho :)
[0:49:30] <HeadsHeldHigh> gee pat how come mom lets you have TWO STARS
[0:49:35] <Gruhunchously> How many Star Bottlecaps does he have?
[0:49:38] <%dmdyne99> Did Pat clean out another casino yet?
[0:49:41] <zeroraider> Boone just stares at couch for an hour
[0:49:46] <satyr_king> Boone is dead inside
[0:49:46] <Estuko> ANOTHER STAR
[0:49:57] <Gruhunchously> "Reminds me of Bitter Springs"
[0:49:57] <AlasterAngelo> @satyr_king Pat's character is gonna have a heart attack
[0:49:57] <%PaladinDupre> TAKE THEM
[0:50:02] <%Jon64s> Boo
[0:50:02] <%crimsonharvest> Every 14 bottles of that stuff is a gallon
[0:50:04] <KangarooCyborg> If the wasteland had credit cards, they'd be from CAPital One
[0:50:05] <blankwaffle> take them
[0:50:05] <%NumbusPlays> oh that's a pretty cool little thing
[0:50:06] <st_jimmy456> this is such a weird/cool concept
[0:50:11] <ahbhajit> take
[0:50:14] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat full bottles and star caps on table
[0:50:15] <%Radski5> hey look it's the equivalent of Pat's Red Bull consumption. apatSmug
[0:50:16] <blankwaffle> why not
[0:50:17] <Reckeler> @kiiiirsten At least 3 if you count player characters
[0:50:19] <Squidbit> they weigh nothing why would you not take them
[0:50:20] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Those sas on the first table are full of sas
[0:50:20] <+mgskomododragon> they dont weigh nothing
[0:50:21] <%SiameseSneeze> eh, they're weightless
[0:50:26] <Zalthia> “I used to sit on couches... with my wife...”
[0:50:27] <Dehlome> Im pretty sure its for a quest anyways
[0:50:31] <%psychodave1234> literally no reason not to
[0:50:33] <%BrazenMask> ITs what the government does
[0:50:35] <Meltgar> Elmo will like them
[0:50:44] <+fatal_penguin_> Quantum Nuka Cola, son
[0:50:45] <lotharrio> Well, they are "real"
[0:50:47] <%PaladinDupre> THEY COUNT
[0:50:50] <natebud> What is your stance on unique miniguns?
[0:50:50] <%jiin6> real fake caps
[0:50:51] <satyr_king> How can you tell ? 🤔
[0:51:03] <%Beerswithbears> Take them you coward
[0:51:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> And all the bottles rise up an inch after you take a cap off the table.
[0:51:05] <Mnightshyamallama> how many blue star caps do you have now @AngriestPat ?
[0:51:08] <Gruhunchously> To be fair to Boone, he lost his wife literally weeks ago. It's probably still raw.
[0:51:08] <+mgskomododragon> how can you counterfeit a bottlecap anyhow?
[0:51:21] <Dehlome> make one from scrap
[0:51:22] <blankwaffle> shoulda just taken the counterfeits
[0:51:26] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You gonna play with the turn based combat mod?
[0:51:26] <valachi> Pat just hit their frigging wings
[0:51:26] <+fatal_penguin_> @GeneralSCPatton The good ol' Creation Engine
[0:51:31] <satyr_king> @AngriestPat favorite pistol in the game?
[0:51:31] <CrabSlacks> EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS
[0:51:32] <Estuko> @mgskomododragon prob some paint
[0:51:33] <CastellanVon> That's why you take a shotgun to them
[0:51:34] <Gruhunchously> Holy shit
[0:51:35] <alrobot2014> this is deathclaw, cazador, and nightstalker territory
[0:51:38] <%jiin6> you never seen the world frak up in RL before?
[0:51:39] <FracturedImage> Get better at sniping
[0:51:40] <%crimsonharvest> If only you had a way to launch a long range explosive and cripple their wings before they could notice you
[0:51:46] <satyr_king> LUL
[0:51:47] <%Theophilus567> That’s why you bring a semi automatic rifle.
[0:51:50] <thebestestkevin> i still cant believe how absurdly deadly cazadores are
[0:51:56] <PabuPanda> TENTOMON, NOOOOOOOO
[0:51:56] <%psychodave1234> @mgskomododragon so the reason that caps are considered money is because there will only ever be so many of them. it's a perfect economy in that there can never be inflation
[0:52:01] <%Kodpol> Night everyone
[0:52:08] <arcaderabbit48> @mgskomododragon Pound a bit of aluminum into the vague shape, add some paint with a fine-tipped paintbrush, and then just excuse the inconsistencies with the fact that bottlecaps are fucking old.
[0:52:11] <natebud> night to you
[0:52:13] <%Radski5> you have to gat those mf'ers with an uzi or some shit
[0:52:14] <%Kodpol> duckHey duckHey duckSleep duckSleep
[0:52:16] <Coystick> Nice
[0:52:18] <zeroraider> the literal worst
[0:52:19] <lotharrio> Going to big MT to get poison immunity makes Cazadors less awful.
[0:52:19] <%jiin6> to space with ya cazadork
[0:52:21] <randomp141> @Kodpol Have a good sleep
[0:52:26] <Coystick> WINGS MAN
[0:52:26] <AlasterAngelo> @psychodave1234 what about NCR bucks?
[0:52:32] <Meltgar> Where's mah Cazador riding deathclaws??
[0:52:36] <blankwaffle> that propulsion
[0:52:42] <Estuko> what'd be scarier to look at from a safe distance? Deathclaws or Cazadores?
[0:52:54] <+fatal_penguin_> You could of thrown the fake bottlecaps at them, might of hurt them more
[0:53:00] <Gruhunchously> If you see those wasp cocoons, it's probably a next
[0:53:05] <VeryTricky> what tipped you off? was it the giant egg sacks on the wall?
[0:53:11] <%jiin6> i love the Cazaclaws(can't remember its name) mod?
[0:53:11] <thebestestkevin> @Estuko At least you can hit deathclaws at a distance
[0:53:14] <zaptar13> EDF! EDF!
[0:53:14] <%Theophilus567> @estuko Deathclaws have so much perception there is no safe distance lol
[0:53:14] <%TheSpiritof2277> Cazadores, since they're fast as shit @Estuko
[0:53:15] <%Jjrossman> WOOZY
[0:53:16] <%crimsonharvest> Cazador in your face? Man up and take drugs.
[0:53:17] <randomp141> @Estuko Cazadores, they don't have a safe distance.
[0:53:17] <%nofestu2> its woozy time
[0:53:19] <arcaderabbit48> So when do we find the Cazador queen?
[0:53:20] <dekkitout> iirc the caps used for currency are exclusively nuka cola caps
[0:53:21] <%psychodave1234> @AlasterAngelo considering the ncr wasnt a thing before the war, the ncr has a way to print paper, meaning that they can be subject to inflation by over producing the cash
[0:53:22] <KRSG> @Chat Alice McLafferty says that the Crimson Caravan or whomever will regularly make new caps.
[0:53:22] <%kiiiirsten> @Estuko Deathclaws if you are ignorant about the power of WOOZY
[0:53:27] <%Radski5> Pat just has basics like Project Nevada and the Community Patch.
[0:53:29] <natebud> grab some eggs for later
[0:53:31] <+fatal_penguin_> Where's the Cazardor Hive Mind
[0:53:32] <Meltgar> @AngriestPat you have mustard in your bloodstream
[0:53:39] <sgtlaggy> never understood why cazadors have such ridiculous hp + damage
[0:53:42] <Estuko> It's 50/50 from chat LUL as far as I know, Cazadores pretty much flashstep behind you
[0:53:45] <VeryTricky> what are cazadors mutated from anyway?
[0:53:45] <Gorgen> well they're dead
[0:53:46] <%manwithboxonhead> Hello there, my name is Cazador. What’s your name?
[0:53:46] <%psychodave1234> @solidoutlaw hey fucker welcome
[0:53:49] <CrabSlacks> it's not

[0:54:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> @estuko Nothing personnel
[0:54:01] <slothslayer828> not anymore
[0:54:01] <a_mad_dragon> they'r mutated from cazadores
[0:54:04] <arcaderabbit48> I feel like Deathclaws have a smaller aggro radius?
[0:54:04] <Gruhunchously> They move so fast
[0:54:05] <natebud> grab some eggs for later
[0:54:06] <%kiiiirsten> great sniping.........
[0:54:08] <solidoutlaw> ive def been on before
[0:54:10] <%Count_Long> Cazadores are mutated from tarantula hawks, which are fucking terrifying anyhow
[0:54:14] <dekkitout> tarantula hawk wasp + big mt = cazadore
[0:54:16] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat kinda the exact opposite really. it's full of the people the NCR don't care about losing. rooShrug
[0:54:17] <%Count_Long> yes
[0:54:19] <AlasterAngelo> what is THAT
[0:54:21] <Gruhunchously> Oh no a gecko. Whatever will we do.
[0:54:23] <AlasterAngelo> oh it's a gecko
[0:54:27] <%Count_Long> my dog tried to eat a tanantula hawk
[0:54:31] <%Count_Long> ive never been more scared
[0:54:31] <Futurecity10> rip?
[0:54:35] <+AncientToco> Cazadors were created in 2003
[0:54:38] <alrobot2014> i think we're close to vault 34
[0:54:39] <AlasterAngelo> 21 SUCK MY DICK
[0:54:40] <%psychodave1234> @Count_Long how'd that go for him
[0:54:42] <grayjammer> s u c k m y d i c k
[0:54:42] <%Radski5> Cazadors are hawks, wasps and tarantulas.
[0:54:45] <%Jjrossman> @Futurecity10 you're in here too?
[0:54:49] <%Jjrossman> jesus christ
[0:54:50] <stratfel112> nah it's filled with hopeless a-holes who can can't save themselves
[0:54:52] <%Count_Long> i grabbed him by the neck before he clamped oni t, and RAN
[0:54:52] <thebestestkevin> cazadore poison does like a million dps, and lasts 20,000 years without antivenom
[0:54:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> oh shit... tarantulas are bad foodstuffs
[0:54:56] <%PaladinDupre> GECKO
[0:54:57] <Gruhunchously> Are we going to be doing Red Lucy's quest anytime soon?
[0:54:57] <Futurecity10> I uh, have no idea who you are rossman
[0:54:59] <%kiiiirsten> GECKO PAT

[0:55:02] <%AllyBeeBoo> its anor londo
[0:55:03] <CrabSlacks> I think it's a mole rat
[0:55:04] <CrimsonFox777> Gecko
[0:55:05] <%jiin6> 1 deathclaw + 1 cazador + 1 crazy modder = nightmare fuel
[0:55:08] <randomp141> Night Stalker or Coyote.
[0:55:09] <+TheMattman1313> Infinite Nightstalkers piled one ach other
[0:55:10] <%kiiiirsten> @Meltgar i don't think so
[0:55:12] <WackyXmand> @AngriestPat when you planning on head to Jacobstown?
[0:55:12] <Estuko> PogChamp did we get to the Pit? No that's a geck from a weird angle
[0:55:14] <CrabSlacks> welp
[0:55:15] <%Tyonidus> LOL
[0:55:18] <VeryTricky> "a wasp that hunts tarantulas" dang thats fucked
[0:55:25] <randomp141> Night stalker
[0:55:26] <+mmSoTasty> doesn't eat them though
[0:55:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> If it bleeds you can shoot it
[0:55:27] <alrobot2014> oh god that's nightstalker cave
[0:55:32] <Stratiotai2> jesus fuck. I just googled tarantula hawk
[0:55:36] <Mnightshyamallama> the idea that the gecko and the cazadors give you the same xp is silly
[0:55:37] <Meltgar> @kiiiirsten oof can't wait to see it
[0:55:38] <%Count_Long> Sacry innit
[0:55:40] <%Radski5> Cazadore venom does a brazillion damage and lasts until the next nuclear winter
[0:55:41] <alrobot2014> there's like amillion of them
[0:55:41] <Gruhunchously> @Stratiotai2 Yeah?

[0:55:42] <%Thatghostpepper> has pat played blue mage in FF14
[0:55:43] <+mmSoTasty> lays an egg on the paralyzed tarantula and the baby eats it alive
[0:55:45] <%jiin6> Snake dogs
[0:55:49] <a_mad_dragon> SNEKPUP
[0:55:50] <%kiiiirsten> Claims to be a night stalker yet stalks during the day
[0:55:52] <%Count_Long> Coyote Peterson made a sting video for it, go watch taht shit after the stream
[0:55:56] <dekkitout> the insect kingom is full of things that xenomorh their babies
[0:56:00] <+mmSoTasty> but it prioritizes less essential organs to keep the tarantula alive longer
[0:56:02] <Estuko> FeelsBadMan doggos that never got a chance to get petted
[0:56:05] <%jiin6> alone in the world is a little snake dog
[0:56:05] <arcaderabbit48> I feel like efforts should be made to domesticate Nightstalkers
[0:56:05] <Futurecity10> okay well, apparently my internet is dead
[0:56:11] <Stratiotai2> fuck those things with fire
[0:56:11] <natebud> grab some eggs for a quest later

[1:16:49] <%jiin6> We get it Boone, you need a psychiatrist
[1:16:51] <%Count_Long> No, Im just saying... War is largely, you know KILLING HUMANS. So how exactly are you going to say, you may have murdered a bunch of folks in combat, and thats fine, But you did it the wrong way, so now, youre going to die or go to jail. You fuckin what?
[1:16:51] <PSI_Guy95> time to crash the party!
[1:16:55] <+Flambage> If only Great Khans gave good Karma. Then Boone wouldn't feel so bad
