To help you see how old you are, I was in the 6th grade when I started watching your content, and I am now a college graduate with a salaried Software Engineering position. Thank you for so many years of couch-goblin insanity! <3

[0:06:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> @pokefan9956 something like that

[0:06:50] <foulfoamz> pat's only getting shorter from here on out

[0:15:06] <%ElkRiverDog> Happy Birthday, Geif‚Äôs dad! I‚Äôve had a blast watching you play Disco Elysium, but I also noticed that my anxiety was really high during the streams. Then I realized I took big sighs of relief whenever Kim spoke, and it clicked. Almost every voice in the game triggers my ‚Äúthis person is untrustworthy and I need to get away from them‚Äù response, except Kim‚Äôs. Is that supposed to happen, or am I being weird?

[0:15:53] <%JoshManVGH> Cheer500 Aging has a weird effect on ones perspective of Time. Was thinking to myself the other day about how far FFXIV has come mechanically from "WAY BACK" when it had TP and non-standardized MP pools, only to realize those just went away at the start of Shadowbringers. Enjoy your warping perspective of Time, and have a Happy Birthday!

[0:23:35] <DianaTheAscian> man... why are there no good shlooters
[0:23:37] <Ravioli_Ronin> What did they do, I can‚Äôt be bothered to even read destiny news
[0:23:37] <%ssjklyco> How do you fuck up transmog?
[0:23:41] <@commanderclaw> How the fuck is their system worse than XIV's? It's incredible
[0:23:44] <%depressed_skeleton> **Internally screaming**
[0:23:46] <%shurtal> 33 years worth of seasons to transmog all legendaries
[0:23:46] <%Valdorick> Never get in the way of people dressing up their paper dolls
[0:23:47] <%Alazull> No
[0:23:47] <Visorak6> Oh god its as bad as we feared?
[0:23:48] <%Alazull> Why
[0:23:49] <%Alazull> No
[0:23:51] <%W1nterTitan> or just give them moneyyyy
[0:23:51] <penitentpendant> Wow, that's extra dumb
[0:23:53] <+GaiaGreen> That is SO dumb
[0:23:53] <%ShogunNoonto> How
[0:23:54] <%tusk102> WHAT???
[0:23:55] <%tusk102> WHY
[0:23:56] <%JoshManVGH> How do you fuck glamours up THAT badly

[0:24:14] <Ravioli_Ronin> Like who actually thinks that‚Äôs fun?
[0:24:21] <$realm_forge> It‚Äôs a 5 step dmv feeling process
[0:24:22] <%valriot> Its fucked, but also alien shoot
[0:24:27] <+lukausedsteal> as someone who just started this season i dont think i'll be effected too much but yeah that sucks major dookie shit
[0:24:37] <nmaten> thank god i quit before that
[0:24:38] <jorniev> LIKE the worst even by the standards of a regular non pat person
[0:24:42] <+Mrbaconator> GOD i have a friend who firmly believes sunsetting was good
[0:24:45] <UniteUltraPlatinum> Destiny needs an ARR style kick in the ass and  will never get one
[0:24:50] <%crimsonharvest> live services will always betray you 100% of the time
[0:25:02] <%Alazull> Your friend is dumb
[0:25:05] <Namillus> sunsetting more like sundowning
[0:25:08] <+anovertmoose> I hope you have a wonderful birthday
[0:25:12] <farrellcityking> Happy Birthday to the Lord of the Goblin Trolls!
[0:25:17] <%SirGO0SE> what a mess
[0:25:18] <+lukausedsteal> the sunsetting, even as a new player, made me vastly upset
[0:25:20] <%hax_metatron> HAPPY BIRTHDAY
[0:25:23] <Ranryu692> I'm so glad I touched the Destiny 2 beta and said "nope"
[0:25:23] <jorniev> what even is sunsetting? all i heard is thats it was terrible
[0:25:30] <+lukausedsteal> i dont want to grind new currency for old broken guns
[0:25:40] <%Draleokong> Pat JoJolion Villain is 95% to be a Milf
[0:25:42] <%valriot> Its very bizarre, but some of the 3 year old stuff needed to go
[0:25:47] <Ravioli_Ronin> It sounds like you have to be an actual psychopath to get into Destiny/ other MMOs, cause none of this sounds fun at all
[0:25:49] <%crimsonharvest> his power grows
[0:25:51] <%walternatorz> Pat lives off of spite.
[0:25:54] <%Alazull> FUELED BY ANGER AND DISTASTE!
[0:25:57] <Profmcstevie> HE LIVES THROUGH RAGE
[0:25:59] <%Jeshk0> let the anger cure your hangover

[0:27:08] <%trllly> Just make every gun bad. Then you dont have to worry about people hoarding good gun.
[0:27:11] <ZE_Count> Anger has injected energy into the pat.
[0:27:18] <%psidefx> HBD PAT!!
[0:27:26] <%valriot> Its complicated, since for stuff thats nearly 3 or more years old? Its fucked, how do you make new stuff?
[0:27:28] <%depressed_skeleton> i am now dead
[0:27:29] <jorniev> SO YOUR GUNS DIE OF OLD AGE!?
[0:27:29] <Visorak6> Its a lazy solution to power creep caused by poor game design
[0:27:35] <+lukausedsteal> oh thats even worse then what I thought!!!
[0:27:36] <%Das_Bass> lol

[0:28:19] <%JoshManVGH> @yourliteraldog Oh that's good!
[0:28:23] <%tusk102> Cheer500 How do you feel about having the same bday as Shrek Kappa
[0:28:27] <%psidefx> Oh no Destiny talk that has me weeping
[0:28:27] <jorniev> so all the weapons got crapier
[0:28:39] <%JoshManVGH> Magic The Gunnering the Business model
[0:28:39] <yourliteraldog> That sounds fucking terrible
[0:28:47] <jorniev> what
[0:28:47] <Ravioli_Ronin> So what you‚Äôre telling us is that Bungie is staffed by a bunch of robots who don‚Äôt know what fun is?
[0:28:48] <%valriot> Was more like 20
[0:28:48] <Visorak6> THE EXACT SAME ROLLS TOO
[0:28:48] <%thedankestmeeme> YO did you see the PSO 2 New genesis stuff?!
[0:28:54] <MonsterGills> jonahs1Really
[0:29:05] <+lukausedsteal> There still aren't any good Scout Rifles!
[0:29:07] <$realm_forge> It‚Äôs a good shooter but a shitty mmo
[0:29:18] <+lukausedsteal> but nobody uses scout rifles
[0:29:21] <%valriot> That was the shitty part LUL
[0:29:22] <%Das_Bass> what a shitshow
[0:29:22] <%logoth_> lol
[0:29:24] <+MisterAvry> fuck right off
[0:29:24] <jorniev> UUUUUGH
[0:29:25] <%Alazull> That's disrespectful
[0:29:28] <yourliteraldog> Sunsetting sounds like the game has alzhiemers
[0:29:28] <rekinom> how about fuck you bungie
[0:29:29] <+MisterAvry> that's awful
[0:29:30] <%Valdorick> GAAAAAAH

[0:29:43] <+rdark_ksu> so "fuck you do it again"
[0:29:46] <%Kirby_Sauce> oh. i didn't even know he was on
[0:29:48] <+PkSilent01> That's why I stopped playing Destiney and stoped playing Forsaken
[0:29:50] <%psidefx> SAME!
[0:29:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And thats why u never play MMOs kids
[0:29:52] <%Kirby_Sauce> !sellout
[0:29:52] <@Moobot> "If you *ever* have the opportunity to sell out you sell out as hard as you can it will be the best thing that ever happened to your fucking life! No one ever regretted selling out, except for 'artists' who care about their 'integrity' 'n shit." ~Pat 2016
[0:29:52] <Ravioli_Ronin> That‚Äôs actually fucking insane
[0:29:58] <%psidefx> Trench Barrel
[0:30:03] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt as a dumb person how does XIV handle this better? is it how you can turn stuff into glams?
[0:30:05] <farrellcityking> That‚Äôs when you tell them to suck your taint
[0:30:13] <afromonk666> Happy birthday man
[0:30:16] <%Das_Bass> What a fucking nightmare
[0:30:16] <+acridpaladin> I still miss my Trophy Hunter. I loved that sniper
[0:30:20] <%jorniev> WHY not JUST put a max cap to stats upgrades
[0:30:24] <%Monkeyweed21> I ran so many BA forges FOR NOTHING
[0:30:27] <BobbyHopp> Happy Patday
[0:30:29] <%vitoxxi> happy cake day pat
[0:30:32] <Archmortal> "hey motherfuckers, time to grind out NEW perfect shit because fuck you"
[0:30:33] <+MisterAvry> keep it? how are you going to be incentivized to purchase more product if you have something you can just keep?
[0:30:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> fuck you for being a month and a half older than me pat
[0:30:37] <Profmcstevie> Have nothing
[0:30:45] <rekinom> @BIumen you get an item you want for glam and you slap it onto whatever you want and it doesn't consume the item so you can use it over and over
[0:30:46] <%valriot> Its fucked, cos they do eventually have to phase old stuff out, cos otherwise whats the point, but they phased TOO MUCH out and fumbled the weapon options
[0:30:46] <%radda343> @BIumen weapons in FFXIV are just stat sticks, in Destiny weapons do different things
[0:30:48] <%Alazull> This makes me not want to play your game
[0:30:51] <%Alazull> iLvl
[0:30:52] <penitentpendant> Stat Stick system
[0:30:58] <+SignScratch> you need mmonclass consciousnesses
[0:31:01] <%DashXero> Just like being on a terrible charm table?
[0:31:05] <Visorak6> Loot is almost entirely cosmetic in 14
[0:31:07] <Archmortal> this is why any time I ever play Destiny 2 I just fucking stick to unranked Crucible.  Fuck this grinding horseshit
[0:31:24] <%isa_sensei96> This doesn't Produce my D O P A M I N E
[0:31:25] <Profmcstevie> FF is just number stick, looks nice but doesn't do anything different
[0:31:31] <+BIumen> understood, i forgot guns arent swords thank you
[0:31:36] <%logoth_> number go up
[0:31:38] <ZE_Count> Now I kinda wanna play warframe
[0:31:58] <%valriot> FFXIV is low attachment but throw away, Destiny is high attachment but harder to balance
[0:31:59] <+lukausedsteal> @Archmortal PvP will never not be a shitshow in that game. Fucking stasis made sure of that.
[0:32:03] <marcdyllan> @PatStaresAt Wow sounds like ppl who make this game need to take a class in loss aversion 101
[0:32:05] <%Garthunox> NAH DESYNTH EVERYTHING!
[0:32:06] <%Broand> In All points bulletin, you could buy a gun for a week, and then you have to buy it again when the week is up
[0:32:16] <%jorniev> GOOD job destiny for just machine gunning your foot
[0:32:32] <%JoshManVGH> That 2019 Perfect Paradox is moldy, use fresh new 2021 Perfect Paradox
[0:32:32] <+SignScratch> renting a gun really at that point
[0:32:33] <%valriot> They are tbf
[0:32:34] <%depressed_skeleton> "They're ok."
[0:32:48] <Archmortal> @lukausedsteal oh yeah for sure, it was real fun going in WITHOUT that while everyone rocked my shit.  But it's possible to still deal with Stasis compared to re-grinding everything
[0:32:51] <ebrion> Gun subscription, you just lease it for the season!
[0:32:52] <+DinnerCalzone> man destiny sounds kinda fucked
[0:33:05] <cardamomo88> LUL
[0:33:07] <Visorak6> "oh cool can I get my arsenal back?"
[0:33:07] <%depressed_skeleton> "You can't get your old guns back tho."
[0:33:12] <+SignScratch> rent a center tactics
[0:33:12] <%vitoxxi> destiny sounds like borderlands 2 the mmo but bad
[0:33:13] <%tusk102> except the ones we already sunsetted?
[0:33:16] <Archmortal> @DinnerCalzone it is
[0:33:18] <%Kaask> if only
[0:33:26] <+acridpaladin> They did say they might bring sunsetting back when they figure out a "better" version
[0:33:27] <%logoth_> get them ONE MORE TIME
[0:33:40] <+CammerTime21> GET EM AGAIN
[0:33:43] <%valriot> Keeping old stuff is a bad idea to be fair, you cant balance 1000s of gun, there needs to be some kind of refresh, its a super fucked online game issue
[0:33:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> pat, if you can just infuse your best shotgun to max power forever *Then why grind for anything if you already have a godroll?*
[0:33:45] <%depressed_skeleton> Bungie = clowns
[0:33:47] <%caramelatte1> dead game
[0:33:49] <%walternatorz> that's so lazy
[0:33:50] <%jorniev> THANKS I HATE IT
[0:33:50] <+bugz_munny> i hate it
[0:33:55] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they also said they might bring back sunsetting later if they "find a betterversion"
[0:33:55] <%Monkeyweed21> why should you even trust them after that
[0:33:57] <+OmegaWeltall> yea i was done with destiny years ago
[0:33:58] <LocalRobyn> sosGame
[0:34:02] <Basch71> by the time that happens, Endwalker drops LUL
[0:34:04] <Archmortal> Clearly Activision was not the only problem with Bungie
[0:34:05] <%valriot> Recluse wasnt unique
[0:34:08] <+SignScratch> run that hamster wheel, you'll get a treat
[0:34:11] <vile_brand> are they trying to lose players? cause they're succeeding.
[0:34:12] <+OhioNitsud> Destiny gets super boring after a while. On top of all those bad decisions
[0:34:33] <%harry_macdougall> harry_macdougall subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 15 months of mind goblins, burgers, and shit lord behavior. happy birthday
[0:34:38] <%valriot> Recluse is the reason sunsetting happened to be fair
[0:34:38] <+acridpaladin> recluse and mountaintop feel like theyre the reason sunsetting was brought back
[0:34:40] <%jorniev> naw man
[0:34:41] <+Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt it seems very much like a ou gather these resources to be strong and then someone gets strong and the devs say "not like that"
[0:34:53] <%depressed_skeleton> "Give us More money and we'll consider it."
[0:34:53] <+OmegaWeltall> give money BACK!? LUL
[0:34:56] <+GrayMatterMiner> happy birf man
[0:34:58] <yourliteraldog> Magic the Gunnering
[0:34:58] <kazadog> i played like 30 hours of destiny 1 and dont remember a single thing about that game because its the gaming equivalent of grey gruel
[0:34:58] <+spongeofmystery> Hey Pat, just want to let you know that for your birthday I went out and did a bunch of littering, just like you asked
[0:35:00] <%JoshManVGH> A dollar has never been more gone.
[0:35:06] <%logoth_> Look at the cat!!
[0:35:09] <Archmortal> they're about to hyper-nerf something just like the Recluse.  I forget which one but same deal, a pinnacle PvP weapon that they just want to screw over.  They also did it to Luna's Howl and Long Forgotten (but partially undid the nerf recently)
[0:35:12] <%jorniev> god everything about this sounds awfull
[0:35:12] <%trllly> "STOP ENJOYING OUR GAME YOU DICKS"
[0:35:14] <+CammerTime21> like warframe does sometimes?
[0:35:17] <%psidefx> Luv mah guns
[0:35:17] <Discount_CJ> And this is the studio that once made Halo :(
[0:35:19] <%crimsonharvest> on top of it destiny's peak of fashion is a tron football player it looks so boring
[0:35:19] <%tusk102> but not that gun! @PatStaresAt
[0:35:23] <Pt_Kamen> Happy Birthday!
[0:35:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Man I can't believe people bitch about Warframe when stuff like this exists
[0:35:26] <Visorak6> No its more the devs release an over-tuned gun that everyone wants to use and then they go "we should punish the players instead of learning from this"
[0:35:31] <%Das_Bass> Remember Black Hammer from D1 and how they killed it @PatStaresAt
[0:35:32] <$realm_forge> They really have a bad habit of nerving anything remotely effective
[0:35:33] <%logoth_> Monster hunter avoids this by just making a new entry
[0:35:37] <%valriot> I genuinely struggle to think of a solution that isnt just make a new game
[0:35:46] <+CammerTime21> Being a warframe and D2 player is suffering
[0:35:54] <penitentpendant> Warframe: Welcome to being OP
[0:35:55] <+acridpaladin> zaw?
[0:35:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's so weird how those guys made the OG Halo series
[0:35:56] <%jorniev> prime?
[0:35:59] <+Mrbaconator> zaw?
[0:36:01] <+SignScratch> your fun is affecting our profits. Stop that
[0:36:04] <%JoshManVGH> Stop sending thoughts and prayers to my Guardian, you are making him too powerful. The devs can no longer stop him.
[0:36:05] <%ElkRiverDog> psaWink
[0:36:14] <Sunstalker> all the melees are busted
[0:36:18] <%jorniev> melee is busted, also its boring
[0:36:20] <+PkSilent01> When they nerf the Recluse, I died inside because I grinded for a month straight, all gone in the blink of an eye.
[0:36:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Now you can just mash anything and win forever
[0:36:23] <%MisterRockett> @JoshManVGH LOL
[0:36:24] <+RealMichaelPhelps> girls love my long zaw
[0:36:25] <@SoFarFetched> its the baby psaGib psaGib psaGib psaGib
[0:36:29] <%trllly> "B-but, what if they go up against new players and absolutely destroy them?" Well... maybe down pair up new players with people who have been playing since launch.
[0:36:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt destiny keeps making their weapons worth, but warframe never makes anything weaker to match
[0:36:36] <AFlyingTaco1> @patstaresat If you want a good laugh, go check out Bungie's latest TWAB. Boy do I love grinding for shit that I already earned.
[0:36:36] <%valriot> That USED to be the Destiny problem
[0:36:40] <%tusk102> worse*
[0:36:44] <+Gespens> Couldn't this have been avoided by changing guns so they have a base stat and then bonus stats/effects as their variations and you do server resets on the variations that you own, then you need to pass on better stats? Give you a reason to minmax, do content and you can still keep your favorite weapons
[0:36:47] <+GrayMatterMiner> he's asking for pets PET THE BABY
[0:36:49] <%Ranryu692> Warframe is still great until you hit that point, though
[0:36:52] <+OmegaWeltall> ye fuck ballance
[0:36:55] <LocalRobyn> [True Old Baby]
[0:36:56] <+acridpaladin> dude its not even zaws. Ive been crushing the hard mode stuff with just a Mire, a old and terrible sword
[0:36:59] <%Valdorick> That seems more like a problem of the players optimizing fun out of the game. Just use the inferior pretty looking weapons.
[0:36:59] <Teyaric> Oh they CARE they just BAD at it
[0:37:00] <+GrayMatterMiner> yis
[0:37:01] <%crimsonharvest> Destiny is also obsessed with squeezing the mass instead of fishing for whales
[0:37:02] <Visorak6> Which is HILARIOUS because bungies REFUSES to balance PVP and PVE separately enough to matter
[0:37:04] <%jorniev> shotguns fot nerfed though
[0:37:04] <Archmortal> Warframe is like "you'll get bored of using that eventually."  Destiny is like "EVERYTHING MUST BE SHIT"
[0:37:04] <+Mrbaconator> the problem with power creep based action RPG video games is you strive to reach the top but the devs don't know what to do with the people that reach it @PatStaresAt
[0:37:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> bo no-one cares about pvp in warframe
[0:37:05] <%valriot> Mountaintop fucked Destinys balance forever
[0:37:06] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh did you just hear about it? LUL
[0:37:06] <+OhioNitsud> its teh baby!
[0:37:08] <%ssjklyco> One is at least Free
[0:37:08] <+OmegaWeltall> the old baby
[0:37:09] <Teyaric> They'd need to redo the whole game in order to attempt balance
[0:37:10] <cardamomo88> BibleThump
[0:37:11] <@SoFarFetched> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[0:37:15] <%tusk102> @Gespens no because some destiny guns have unique perks that no other guns have
[0:37:17] <%walternatorz> is there a freighter in the background?
[0:37:18] <sora2025> DONT LET IT SET IN
[0:37:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> aw the purring
[0:37:26] <%radda343> MercyWing1 psaPorgmo MercyWing2
[0:37:26] <%trllly> Teach the boys to swim pat
[0:37:28] <+lukausedsteal> pat dont drown your animals
[0:37:30] <%Garthunox> @ssjklyco both of em are free
[0:37:31] <%depressed_skeleton> yw. :)
[0:37:32] <+GrayMatterMiner> he purr
[0:37:38] <+OmegaWeltall> ah WutFace BRIGHT
[0:37:42] <%Valdorick> This has been the Destiney TED Talk.
[0:37:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Warframe updated literally every melee to be usable infinitely
[0:37:44] <koffeemancer> Warframe devs only care about making new stuff so the games doesnt just die
[0:37:45] <%valriot> Im still gonna pplay it next month LUL LUL LUL gun shoot good pewpew Titan punch
[0:37:47] <%trllly> That wasnt a sex joke but whatever
[0:37:54] <%jorniev> OOOF
[0:38:00] <Archmortal> Also, besides just the gun balance problem and Stasis, Destiny 2's PvP is STILL atrocious and revolves around Heavy Ammo the way Dark Souls 1 PvP revolves around backstabs
[0:38:01] <$realm_forge> Spite infusion successful
[0:38:12] <AFlyingTaco1> Wait did he hear about how they're handling transmog yet?
[0:38:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> So now I'm using a rivened dark sword and it's stronger than broken war
[0:38:21] <%walternatorz> numbers.

[0:57:58] <penitentpendant> Yeah, the fast travel kinda sucks
[0:58:00] <arkv01> max travel
[0:58:02] <ARobotFromtheFuture1> Smoker on the roof
[0:58:04] <%walternatorz> fast travel seems to only work at the fast travel locations
[0:58:07] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the fast travel in this game is weird
[0:58:09] <ZE_Count> only can fast travel at fast travel points
[0:58:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 i was forced to buy the remaster, since xbox will not allow me to buy the artorias dlc for the 360 version. i hate the remaster, since she'll get to go though blighttown at 60 fps, instead of the god-intended 13
[0:58:16] <trickster721> No fast travel, explore for extra content
[0:58:21] <+drakthebest> Fast travel is super inconsistent, only works at the fast travel locations and sometimes it doesn't even do that
[0:58:25] <%feign___> they're like warp points
[0:58:28] <vadnhi> This game can be frustrating like that, cause - yes - you sometimes get free heals that you waste if you use healing items right away, but then, you 8also* take negatives to your rolls if you're 'wounded' in any way.
[0:58:29] <%Dakuu75> Only thing I remember from the last stream is "Cock Carousel".

[1:58:18] <Hanyusha> @JobbedBone so just walk out with kim, go to THE WALL and get art cop?
[1:58:19] <ConflagrationsGaming> or is kim just elsewhere,
[1:58:20] <HeroToxiko> @aiutare47 perfect
[1:58:25] <%toolofparanoia> Go get your gun first then kill Cuno's dad
[1:58:31] <@commanderclaw> Kim's taking the body to the coroner
[1:58:32] <%Garthunox> phew
[1:58:35] <ingman112> Kim's just delivering the body
[1:58:37] <%toolofparanoia> Gun beats steroids
[1:58:39] <Estwilde> @ConflagrationsGaming Kim took the body to the station and went home
[1:58:44] <%Garthunox> PS4 has so many soft locks before the most recent patch
[1:58:47] <HeroToxiko> @aiutare47 that does explain the lack of hover pronunciations tho
[1:58:49] <ConflagrationsGaming> PHEW
[1:58:50] <%Garthunox> it was rediculous
[1:58:58] <ConflagrationsGaming> thanks for telling me guys
[1:59:02] <vadnhi> Remember, tho... If Kim is with you, he'd probably put up a fuss over *confiscating* the drugs, rather than taking them back to C\uno.
[1:59:04] <HonterThompson> @ConflagrationsGaming Kim's delivering the body to the RCM coroner and is probably sleeping in a hotel in Jamrock or somewhere
[1:59:05] <ingman112> By your shack
[1:59:07] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> did pat ever check the buzzer on the front of the building ?
[1:59:08] <ingman112> Literally right by
[1:59:11] <penitentpendant> East of your shack
[1:59:11] <%hax_metatron> Did you happen to click the broken fence already?
[1:59:11] <%rrratbastard> theres a dock by your shack

[1:59:12] <ConflagrationsGaming> i came in mid stream, heard pat talking abt it on the podcast, and i got SUPER worried
[1:59:13] <NewWillinium> Right by your shack.
[1:59:13] <+JobbedBone> @Hanyusha art center is different, you can't get it until the waterway opens so it means delaying doing a lot
[1:59:14] <+JustToWatch> close to shack
[1:59:14] <aiutare47> @herotoxiko He did fantastic for an amateur IMO
[1:59:15] <%walternatorz> She's on the dock by the shack

[2:02:01] <%jorniev> MORE PERCEPTION
[2:02:06] <%Jeshk0> yesMORE percerption
[2:02:09] <+JobbedBone> if you have thoughts that give bonuses while researching you can put them on and take them off for free before internalization, like clothing
[2:02:13] <Blank9> so much free stuff, everywhere
[2:02:16] <PartyFavors> Yeah, shivers actually mentioned the boots during a chat with Klaasje iirc
[2:02:20] <%Mendin> Pat do you remember a Shivers check that mentioned Boots Under The Fish from a day ago when you thought about the fishing village
[2:02:30] <Hanyusha> why do you need a prybar before talking to Joyce?
[2:02:49] <%toolofparanoia> @DSD24 more like Gaijin Gadget with that hat
[2:02:57] <%Mendin> Short-haired Fishergirl, Woolie will enjoy

[2:04:57] <Broken_Sonex> @aiutare47 If they're legal, than why not?

[2:20:48] <Archmortal> what's the Jamrock Shuffle even give again?
[2:20:48] <vadnhi> Adopting this and slurring the word 'Law' all the time might not help your case in convincing Joyce that you *aren't* a stroke-victim. :P
[2:20:49] <%thetunnelhomer> Unless it messes with your shivers
[2:20:51] <+illusiveSaint> :(

[2:21:20] <+JobbedBone> @jorniev they're thoughts. they can contradict reality
[2:21:25] <%MidnightBurst12> We have evolved beyond the hobocop
[2:21:27] <ingman112> He'll be fine, no worries
[2:21:27] <dukenux> You will be missed, Hobocop
[2:21:31] <PartyFavors> @aiutare47 You're misinterpreting; it makes passive physical checks *easier*

[2:25:38] <aiutare47> Hmm what should you do Pat?
[2:25:39] <%Deft_Thought> Accepting that closure is an illusion and that sorrow is self-serving is about as close to truth as "time heals all wounds" gets

[2:25:49] <%Piemono> find a spot
[2:25:58] <vadnhi> "My love for you, is like a truck..."

[2:28:41] <HonterThompson> So far Harry's had the hots for a foreign corporate spy, a poor widow, and a twink who wears kimonos and sleeps with feds
[2:28:44] <HonterThompson> Interesting taste
[2:28:47] <Sunstalker> Rhetoric, we need to get the dick wet

[2:29:30] <+projectmanatees> Mines
[2:29:31] <vadnhi> @SignScratch Not gonna lie. As a kinda-despondent post-33 yo, this lady was pushing *ALL* of my buttons in my playthrough.
[2:29:32] <+illusiveSaint> wtf are you going to need a mine for?
[2:29:44] <Archmortal> How are you going to start the next Communist Revolution without mines, Pat?
[2:29:45] <PartyFavors> Mines are cool
[2:29:54] <%toolofparanoia> Sea mine!
[2:29:59] <EternalJedi> ah, navy mine
[2:30:05] <+ALazo> what do you NOT need a mine for?
[2:30:11] <Sunstalker> illusiveSaint You know how hard it would be to get a mine when you DO need it?
[2:30:23] <+senfood> @illusiveSaint Who knows but it's better to have one than to nnot have one.
[2:30:32] <yourliteraldog> I need a mine to protect my freedom from space lizards
[2:30:43] <%hax_metatron> she‚Äôs a sunbro!
[2:30:58] <%psidefx> Car?
[2:30:59] <Blank9> what about cuno's dad?
[2:30:59] <ingman112> Seems like a nice lady
[2:31:00] <+lukausedsteal> NOOOOOOO DATE HER
[2:31:01] <%Quigsies> did you forge that letter yet?
[2:31:02] <vadnhi> @yourliteraldog Ordoliberal Space Lizards.
[2:31:04] <penitentpendant> Check the floorboards!
[2:31:05] <HonterThompson> But you need to murder Cuno's dad
[2:31:05] <%Mendin> CUNO'S DAD
[2:31:05] <%Mucmaster> Forge some signatures in you shack
[2:31:08] <%bread_assassin> What about Cuno's dad?
[2:31:08] <%toolofparanoia> Wait what about Cuno's dad?
[2:31:09] <laserbeaming> time to sleepy time
[2:31:10] <ingman112> This would be the time
[2:31:11] <ZE_Count> FORGE FORGE
[2:31:15] <+illusiveSaint> harass cunos dad
[2:31:18] <penitentpendant> Curses!
[2:31:19] <danteftw20> have you ever thought of playing Battle Fleet Gothic Armada 2 for a stream?
[2:31:21] <penitentpendant> (Odd)
[2:31:25] <+Saggitori> kill cunos dad yet
[2:31:26] <+emperri> disco inferno~
[2:31:27] <NewWillinium> Are you set on forging the letter instead of getting it actually signed?
[2:31:27] <%VyperVic> cuno's dad with kim tomorrow
[2:31:27] <%Monkeyweed21> need a gun for cuno's dad
[2:31:27] <Visorak6> I legit dont know why the floorboards arent interactable
[2:31:28] <ingman112> Woof
[2:31:30] <bettysharkface> The song
[2:31:31] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its not time yet
[2:31:32] <AvroEltz> Its not time, yet
[2:31:32] <laserbeaming> lol, who stopped you? Inland?
[2:31:34] <%VatgrownHobo> need to speak to old lady first
[2:31:36] <%Lion_kun> Low perception
[2:31:40] <%Garthunox> did you talk to old woman?
[2:31:43] <%toolofparanoia> Can we boost that?
[2:31:45] <HonterThompson> Gauntlets are better for interfacing, right?
[2:31:48] <penitentpendant> @Visorak6 I THINK it's because it's 'sleep time' rather than 'day'
[2:31:49] <+illusiveSaint> talk to the villagers about the letter first
[2:31:49] <trickster721> I think the floor is an impossible passive check that you get a modifier to later
[2:31:49] <ingman112> It's definitely not low perception
[2:31:50] <%jorniev> wouldnt it be better if you fuck it up?
[2:31:51] <fedemachado96> if you are gonna do cuno's dad with kim
[2:31:53] <+JobbedBone> take speed
[2:31:54] <ingman112> His perception is 10
[2:31:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt level it up?
[2:32:00] <Psyramics> are you wearing any -interface gear
[2:32:01] <+SignScratch> speed?
[2:32:05] <%Mucmaster> Do speed
[2:32:06] <NeroInfinite> cheat cheat cheat
[2:32:06] <+emperri> Kim, turn on Sad FM
[2:32:06] <dinnydanny777> take slow
[2:32:08] <Visorak6> Nah it wasnt here earlier during the day @penitentpendant
[2:32:09] <ingman112> We'll juice you, just give it your best shot
[2:32:09] <%Das_Bass> do drugs
[2:32:12] <penitentpendant> @Psyramics Gloves
[2:32:14] <+Tacowavable> you have to ask the grandma about a certain someone to interact with the floor boards
[2:32:17] <Archmortal> No defeating of Cuno's dad?
[2:32:21] <%Monkeyweed21> you have skill points
[2:32:21] <Alfred_Waaghur> Skill point, sure!
[2:32:22] <danteftw20> come on pat all the KOOL KIDZ are doing it!
[2:32:27] <penitentpendant> @Visorak6 Well yes, but that was before the other trigger was flagged
[2:32:33] <ZE_Count> oh man shivers low
[2:32:34] <%VyperVic> go on
[2:32:35] <laserbeaming> a shot of speed would let you spend 2 skill points on Interfacing
[2:32:37] <penitentpendant> Don't level interfacing!
[2:32:39] <HonterThompson> Why is he hoarding these skill points
[2:32:40] <%Mucmaster> If you level that up and chat boosts motor you'll have a better chance
[2:32:41] <%toolofparanoia> level up?
