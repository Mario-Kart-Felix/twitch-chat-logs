[0:09:00] <lithogensnake> CVX vs 5 and 6?
[0:09:02] <%heroicspiritavenger> Hey Pat, you should rename Skelmo to Pro-Bono so that his name matches you, Paige, and Peepee

[0:09:28] <+Remery_> this game is the equivalent of a fat man eating a deli sandwich.
[0:09:30] <%Piemen99> \
[0:09:33] <+MelancholicMasochist> might as well get it out of the way lol
[0:09:42] <+Wooden_ben> Bearable

[0:10:10] <%Darthwaffler> Darthwaffler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! I aborted my sub-baby months ago because I don't need that kind of responsibility. Is CVX the DS2 of RE?
[0:10:12] <%MelBrooksKA> Zero seemed to have a pretty good start
[0:10:14] <rickyjones47> Really enjoying these earlier streams Pat. Can finally watch n the UK
[0:10:17] <%LaughingCatt> RE6 is SO LONG
[0:10:18] <%theKingRamses> but it has fun gameplay
[0:10:21] <%scaryboisupreme> You gotta admit tho, Alexia has some bomb as music
[0:10:21] <%LaughingCatt> why is it so long
[0:10:31] <+gustavozxd> 6 you can delete everything and leave the mercenaries mode in
[0:10:35] <%Conyst> it is such along game
[0:10:37] <FG_Leo106> CVX is boring and RE0 is frustrating to play, both are bad imo
[0:10:38] <%Agami23> re6 has some really, really weird tech that makes that game super complex
[0:10:43] <lithogensnake> CVX or Zero remake?
[0:11:01] <%Conyst> zero remake would be great

[0:13:37] <%Typhaeon> I still think your argument about censorship vs self-censorship is a false dichotomy. It's just a matter of soft (corporate/boards) vs hard (government) power

[0:15:18] <%Darthwaffler> Yeah, I watched that podcast yesterday. I was wondering why nobody mentioned the cut content.
[0:15:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> GRAVURE
[0:15:20] <%DetroitSentai> DetroitSentai subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:15:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WTF is GRAVURE?

[0:15:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> AYO HOL UP
[0:15:36] <+worthwhile_off> pat Kappa
[0:15:37] <%Typhaeon> Unfortunate implications
[0:15:37] <+gustavozxd> LUL ITS HILARIOUS
[0:15:37] <tuesti> yeah that was real bad
[0:15:40] <%bluebiscuit94> Really? WTF
[0:15:40] <%NovaKnightmare> What about Persona 2's take on the Fuhrer?
[0:15:41] <ScreamLord> ?
[0:15:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLACK KID
[0:15:43] <%MelBrooksKA> Eat you donuts
[0:15:44] <%NovaKnightmare> @AngriestPat
[0:15:45] <%valriot> Graveur is a word people just use to scam people into thinking they sell nudes, but the don't
[0:15:48] <+SodiumPatrol> Persona 1? you mean persona 3 Kappa
[0:15:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TRUDEAU?
[0:15:49] <SoaringLettuce> oh man chat didn't know
[0:15:49] <%crimsonharvest> its really bad that 'black kid' is even an archetype fuckin christ
[0:15:49] <%passthehanky> persona 1's is INSANE
[0:15:51] <%DetroitSentai> Wait y'all dont know about mark?
[0:15:51] <mistspade> Gravure just seems less honest and makes it sound worse as a result.
[0:15:54] <thatWaulfyguy> SHADOW ARE YOU FO' REAL?
[0:15:58] <%MelBrooksKA> The Furher
[0:15:59] <%Agami23> fate/ has a big issue with self censorship and changing to fit marketting standards. the entire game had to be redone to fit fetishy waifu trash
[0:16:00] <%thegreenbenis> HahaThink
[0:16:00] <%the_vedo_show> atpCarl atpCarl atpCarl
[0:16:02] <+Roundelay11> the worst part of the #FE stuff is that it's badly done
[0:16:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BallerSwagBro9k It's just women posing in skimpy clothes for teenage boys to whack it at
[0:16:05] <LunarRemix> He wear shades though
[0:16:06] <%Garthunox> I was just about to mention that
[0:16:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> BASED PS2 HITLER
[0:16:11] <%trevsded> They hamburgered his character
[0:16:12] <%Taisuru> It's hilarious
[0:16:12] <%Wrashis> and they removed the stache too
[0:16:13] <+gustavozxd> that wasn't just the western version though
[0:16:13] <$joylent_blue> lmfao
[0:16:13] <cureneckbeard> cool hitler
[0:16:15] <%Typhaeon> They put Hitler in COOL GUY SHADES
[0:16:15] <%SummonerMagno> WutFace
[0:16:16] <Ner234> OH NOOoo
[0:16:17] <%Aydarkzero> oh
[0:16:19] <oniwahoo> Cool ass Hitler
[0:16:20] <%CopperTucker> cool hitler
[0:16:20] <%Darthwaffler> COOL HITLER
[0:16:21] <+CavemanInCave> hotler
[0:16:22] <tuesti> Hitler but COOLER
[0:16:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> SUNGLASSES HITLER
[0:16:24] <%MayorRev> DO NOT MAKE HITLER COOL
[0:16:25] <thatWaulfyguy> COOL GUY HITLER UH OH
[0:16:25] <%theKingRamses> MAYBE HE WAS COOL
[0:16:26] <%Taisuru> Rad Hitler
[0:16:27] <%bluebiscuit94> Hitler with sunglasses is the hypest shit
[0:16:28] <%MalekDracarus> @AngriestPat I joined and the first thing I heard was "14 year olds in bikinis."
[0:16:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> COOLTLER
[0:16:29] <%deviljhojho_> tomatoCool put your glasses on
[0:16:29] <%thegreenbenis> Hitler is a pretty cool guy. @AngriestPat
[0:16:30] <%DetroitSentai> He was the coolest
[0:16:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rumtumtugnutz So...softcore? Where did gravure come from? LUL
[0:16:32] <Fenlig> Nazis were all ways cool looking though
[0:16:33] <internetexplorer11> this fuhrer guys seems cool, thanks atlus
[0:16:35] <mistageeza> Hitler did nothing wrong tho
[0:16:35] <neveton> radical Hitler!
[0:16:36] <Ipsenscastle> COOL HITLER FOR TEENS
[0:16:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> HITLER DOES A WILLIE
[0:16:36] <thatWaulfyguy> JoJo Rabbit
[0:16:41] <djazo> pat chan is live
[0:16:44] <Fep3> did you see your CHOESE clip is now front page on youtubehaiku?
[0:16:46] <Zekuu69> Kamina Hitler
[0:16:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Remember FUHRER BRADLEY?
[0:16:50] <+SodiumPatrol> I mean, Japan and nazi Germany were allies Kappa
[0:16:53] <%Agami23> the fire emblem fates localization changes were REAL BAD
[0:16:53] <cureneckbeard> remember the Captain Planet episode where they couldn't show Hitler so they had a guy who looks like Hitler with a Mexican moustache
[0:16:54] <%MelBrooksKA> @MalekDracarus Expect nothing, get less
[0:16:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BallerSwagBro9k No, less than softcore. And it's a japanese thing?
[0:16:54] <NaturalGear> just don't censor, that's it
[0:17:04] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Wasn't that the problem with the Nazi look in general? They look cool but they are monumental shitholes
[0:17:07] <exglebster> Lmao, I knew there would be the backtracking stream after that podcast LUL
[0:17:11] <Balsty> Hey @AngriestPat I want to get back into FFXIV and I stopped near the end of shadowbringers. what should I know before jumping back in?
[0:17:11] <%crimsonharvest> I hate when the localization just straight up cuts content i'll probably never get over the Gamecube Tales of whatever
[0:17:12] <%DetroitSentai> Problem is that people/fanbases kneejerk the small shit like "vagina bones" and dont looks at what actual changes
[0:17:14] <jerree66> So for you it's changes that fundamentlly change the game then? @AngriestPat
[0:17:15] <%Katalist_> I just googled a picture and that's a really cool Hitler
[0:17:17] <thatWaulfyguy> We're not the third reich! We're the Dai-Third Reich!
[0:17:24] <%Typhaeon> You have a lot of young, pubescent men whose interest in abstract sexuality makes their reactions that way
[0:17:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT MUH BIG TIDDIE WAIFU THO
[0:17:28] <%VashyronM> Steve sucks
[0:17:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> I NEED MY ANIME TITS
[0:17:33] <%deviljhojho_> kind of embarassing
[0:17:33] <oyyzzo> anime is dumb
[0:17:37] <%CopperTucker> Vagina bones
[0:17:39] <%Katalist_> I couldn't care less about the anime girls but censorship is always bad
[0:17:40] <djazo> BUT BOOBS THO
[0:17:40] <%Aydarkzero> it's almost not even getting into most of the time
[0:17:41] <Ghostbody> It's all about tone
[0:17:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAT EMPIRE OF DUST CHINESE MAN
[0:17:45] <%thegreenbenis> Fuck off, I want my anime titties. I'm paying full price to not get anime titties
[0:17:49] <%Madbearv> I just want old fashioned zambies Pat
[0:17:49] <%filialpails> I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT MYSELF, I WANT TO LOOK AT TITTIES
[0:17:49] <@commanderclaw> NO
[0:17:49] <+CrowGuy> is pat mad at anime tiddies?
[0:17:52] <%Typhaeon> There are still some more principled arguments to be made
[0:17:53] <+gustavozxd> from what I heard, shades Hitler happened because of Japanese laws, not because of the western localization, so the JP PSP version also had him
[0:17:55] <%Aydarkzero> guys remember to not let your dick control you
[0:17:58] <Stillchr> i dont want the game story changed, i want the original intent from the creators, not some weird changes made by a group outside
[0:17:59] <yeetdabsenpai69> MAH ANIMO BOOBS!
[0:18:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> It basically boils down to that a gravure idol is literally just a pretty girl they take pictures of for people to look at.
[0:18:00] <%valriot> @angriestpat FF8 had people screeching cos they "censored" Siren summon, even though they're playing a bad FF game
[0:18:00] <%crimsonharvest> the inability to reflect on your own bullshit is big boomer energy
[0:18:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah they take it waaaaay to far. And this is coming from a waifu enthusiast
[0:18:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAT LIKE "ITS ALL SO TIRESOME" CHINESE MAN
[0:18:04] <+BigCoffee> Ok but what if my dick is always away, and I'd really just want to see cute things not hidden?
[0:18:05] <@commanderclaw> It won't be okay! I need those specific tiddies!
[0:18:06] <+Tokanova> lol
[0:18:07] <%jillvxlentine> self care is not looking in the comments section of anime games
[0:18:08] <%sporeian94> I'm only about that anime ass cleavage
[0:18:11] <cureneckbeard> Just learn Japanese fluently and import the Japanese game
[0:18:14] <%Mr_Pylon> Like an actual nuanced conversation on this stuff is some of the localization updates to Yakuza 2 to Kiwami 2 where they changed stuff because they wanted to, not because of CENSORSHIPS!
[0:18:16] <%Agami23> fate legit had the opposite of most of this. where it had hot guys and they had to change it to tiddy ladies to fit otaku trashy culture
[0:18:16] <Reaganball_Z> Maybe it shouldn't though
[0:18:17] <%bluebiscuit94> EXACTLY
[0:18:19] <+gustavozxd> BUT PAT THE ART
[0:18:19] <+Tokanova> You can get the tiddies you want, you don't need to get mad about the tiddies that were censored
[0:18:19] <ScreamLord> This goes both ways
[0:18:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> REALLY?
[0:18:21] <thatWaulfyguy> Dark Phrases by Pat
[0:18:22] <+Remery_> infinite tiddy
[0:18:23] <%VashyronM> I can't put my dick away once it's out.
[0:18:23] <igodex13> one click away
[0:18:24] <+SodiumPatrol> wait the ppl talking about it should put their dick away, or the anime girls.
[0:18:25] <gensoukaizou> just learn japanese
[0:18:29] <Captain_Joe1911> carciSmug carciYatta carciGasm
[0:18:30] <%Aydarkzero> it's not that hard
[0:18:30] <%Madbearv> Did you kick the beehive Pat
[0:18:32] <%thegreenbenis> Pat supports censorship, because he hates anime titties
[0:18:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE ART IS SUFFERING PAT LUL
[0:18:36] <london_flexing> REAL TALK
[0:18:38] <ohgodscorpions> i dont know pat all this that you're saying just sounds like privilege
[0:18:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> BUT I WANT THAT SMUT PAT
[0:18:44] <%Typhaeon> I resent the tampering with of artistic intent by foreign translators or a de facto politburo, high or low art
[0:18:44] <%passthehanky> yeah it was play asia
[0:18:45] <%DetroitSentai> yeah playasia did that
[0:18:46] <%redrins> and it WORKED
[0:18:47] <+gustavozxd> "but Pat the intention of the artist"
[0:18:51] <%antshadow14> doa valleyball
[0:18:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> I WANT THAT SPECIFIC SMUT
[0:18:52] <%thegreenbenis> You are paying not to get smut.
[0:18:52] <Balsty> anime was a mistake
[0:18:53] <%Aydarkzero> it was triple3
[0:18:53] <%Agami23> wait, what did they do?
[0:19:02] <%MayorRev> i can google big smut faster than you can complain about your anime titties
[0:19:03] <%Madbearv> Outrage is more eyeballs on your product
[0:19:04] <+CrowGuy> Pat supports censorship because he's a dirty CANADIAN
[0:19:07] <internetexplorer11> final fantasy oof!
[0:19:08] <%crimsonharvest> Riling up nerds is pretty easy so I'm glad someone can profit from it
[0:19:11] <%DetroitSentai> But also it is dumb that sexual stuff is frowned upon in the west
[0:19:20] <NeonBleu> Galaxy brains all around
[0:19:22] <%Aydarkzero> wait really?
[0:19:23] <Reaganball_Z> She's a lshrine maiden
[0:19:24] <Captain_Joe1911> YES
[0:19:24] <%Typhaeon> Also I own Devotion, and it's NEVER leaving my hard drive
[0:19:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Twitter isn't for yelling at people for doing their job badly. It's for yelling at Pat because he thinks the thing you like is dumb.
[0:19:25] <$joylent_blue> hmmm
[0:19:26] <%Aydarkzero> OH
[0:19:28] <%DetroitSentai> THANK YOU
[0:19:29] <Balsty> OOOOHHH
[0:19:30] <$joylent_blue> i suppose
[0:19:33] <NaturalGear> yeah that's also a thing
[0:19:34] <oniwahoo> What?
[0:19:37] <cureneckbeard> yuna is adorable moeblob it's fine
[0:19:39] <xSHARKPUNCHx> ff10 sucks anyway
[0:19:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> YOU BLOW A GUY IN A MILLION PIECES BUT YOU CANT SHOW A TITTY-THE WEST
[0:19:46] <+Remery_> wait really?
[0:19:47] <ohgodscorpions> yep its terrible
[0:19:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Japanese
[0:19:50] <jerree66> wow would never guess that from her english av
[0:19:55] <+SodiumPatrol> didn't know that
[0:19:56] <+Roundelay11> Yamato Nadeshiko
[0:19:57] <mistageeza> feminin strength Kappa
[0:19:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yuna's run cycle in FFX-2 is painful.
[0:19:58] <%bluebiscuit94> YAMATO NADESHIKO to 11
[0:19:58] <$joylent_blue> ohhhhh
[0:19:59] <%Aydarkzero> big strong gals
[0:20:00] <+gustavozxd> hmm Japan
[0:20:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> SURVIVE
[0:20:05] <%SummonerMagno> dancing
[0:20:05] <+albedo455> then X-2 happen
[0:20:09] <ScreamLord> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[0:20:12] <thedank> But the American VA makes her seem autistic instead, sad
[0:20:14] <+gustavozxd> Yuna just keeps dancing
[0:20:18] <cureneckbeard> Yuna's English voice inspired Nyanners to become a voice actress
[0:20:18] <%MelBrooksKA> @sonofthedeepsouth USA*, Europe and Canada don't give a shit about the tiddy
[0:20:22] <$joylent_blue> Hedy Buress
[0:20:24] <internetexplorer11> hiedi klum
[0:20:27] <%Typhaeon> Stomach churning in English
[0:20:37] <thatWaulfyguy> Hanibal Buress
[0:20:37] <+CavemanInCave> hannibal burres
[0:20:38] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, sorry for asking if you've already answered, but any plans for Persona 5 Scramble?
[0:20:39] <Reaganball_Z> "Yes. Yes. Yes."
[0:20:48] <%thegreenbenis> So?
[0:20:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> YES
[0:20:55] <$joylent_blue> i can see that
[0:20:58] <%crimsonharvest> she comes across as utterly without her own will
[0:20:59] <@commanderclaw> That game was translated, not localized
[0:21:00] <%Typhaeon> "Hai" doesn't necessarily mean "yes"
[0:21:05] <Ner234> Huh
[0:21:09] <FacetiousAF> "lost in translation"
[0:21:10] <+Roundelay11> This is always a problem with Japanese directors trying to instruct on English VO
[0:21:10] <%Aydarkzero> huh, never noticed that...
[0:21:10] <cureneckbeard> yuna is kind of like spira's ray of light pat
[0:21:19] <Reaganball_Z> I like when she has to say "yes" really fast while bowing at warp speed.
[0:21:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Persevere
[0:21:21] <%bluebiscuit94> Pure translation is different from localisation
[0:21:26] <Dovakhin573> Yeah there are a ton of people who dont get stuff like
[0:21:26] <LunarRemix> Funny you say that, she's my cousin's favorite FF girl. He adores her.
[0:21:27] <+Remery_> wasn't that what priest were in ff10?
[0:21:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Like a good Japanese woman Kappa
[0:21:35] <djazo> @angriestpat that.s why subs are better then dubs
[0:21:35] <%jillvxlentine> some things in japanese wont make sense in english
[0:21:39] <oniwahoo> I mean, she is literally going to her own death for an organization that is manipulating the world tho so her being a doormat kind of makes sense
[0:21:48] <Reaganball_Z> Was she stoic when Tidus' severed head landed near her?
[0:21:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> And yet in Persona and SMT you can fight a demon on a toilet
[0:21:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Trad Asian Gf that is all the rage
[0:21:53] <%Agami23> the fire emblem fates one was real bad. where they changed two assassins talking about the horrors of war to "..." over and over until the scene ended
[0:21:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SUBS ARE GOD
[0:21:55] <%Aydarkzero> i don't wanna read give me dubs Kappa
[0:21:55] <%sporeian94> Only The Ghost Story dub is objectively superior to the sub
[0:21:55] <+Roundelay11> depends on the dub
[0:21:56] <%Darthwaffler> I love my creepo shit, Pat!
[0:22:00] <%Piemen99> both are good until they arent
[0:22:00] <+pectusumbra> The one that sticks out to me is a support conversation in Fates that got changed from talk about being assassins to literally just ellipses
[0:22:01] <%crimsonharvest> Do you think thats why they suddenly changed course with FF12 and DQ8
[0:22:06] <%valriot> Even the laugh scene suffers the same issue, but it's also shit in Japanese
[0:22:06] <%CopperTucker> Does anyone remember the pedos getting mad that an anime translated lolicon properly and screamed about "bad translations"?
[0:22:08] <+NitronStreams> Subs can still miss the point 9f the original version
[0:22:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dubs have gotten way better
[0:22:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @sporeian94 Very True
[0:22:10] <Kiraklene> But what about the DOA softening gel?
[0:22:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLACK LAGOON DUB IS CHAD
[0:22:11] <%thegreenbenis> Dubs are bad because I have no interest in supporting the funimation cartel.
[0:22:12] <ScreamLord> Kaede in Onimusha Warlords going "Understand" at the beginning sticks out to me for some reason
[0:22:13] <$shadow1man9> Depends on the dub honestly
[0:22:14] <%heroicspiritavenger> @agami23 yeah that was fucking atrocious
[0:22:14] <%Nina96> ilike the fmab dub more than the sub
[0:22:18] <+Krawzwaka> love ya pat
[0:22:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT NO
[0:22:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLACK LAGOON DUB IS THE BEST
[0:22:20] <@commanderclaw> The internet is where nuance goes to die
[0:22:21] <CSeriesJTYPE> LOL
[0:22:22] <+CloniiCory> When I was doing subtitling work for my internship, I learned very fast you want to translate with subtly. Not the equivalent of smashing a wall down with a sledgehammer. Blunt force translation is bleh my Nakama (Nakama means friends)
[0:22:22] <+Remery_> sick commies dude
[0:22:23] <+albedo455> when CVX come to steam?

[0:24:05] <%Typhaeon> I disagree that you can make a distinction, but I'm an absolutist
[0:24:08] <%FacetiousAF> its hard to argue about video game censorship when the vast majority are pointing to sexual changes.
[0:24:11] <%BlueMoonBlues> But Pat, they're not 10-years old, they're 10,000-years old
[0:24:12] <%heroicspiritavenger> Who the fuck cares about the agency of FICTIONAL CHARACTERS

[0:24:26] <%Chatterbox1991> John Wolfe's lp of Devotion is radical

[0:26:19] <+Remery_> A dick wrangling
[0:26:22] <%aishman> aishman subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 18 Months?! TWO Stream babies?! It feels like it was just yesterday I let the goblin king inside. Thank you for your amazing content that always brightens up my day.

[0:26:28] <%DetroitSentai> america is weird about sex stuff, which is weird in the age where anyone can access anything from their phone the mainstream tries to downplay stuff
[0:26:28] <+TopTieramisu> GET ME MY TICKET
[0:26:28] <%Aydarkzero> touch the titty
[0:26:30] <@commanderclaw> Touch tha fishy

[0:26:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> CAUSE WHORES
[0:26:33] <Reaganball_Z> There are tons of "massage" parlors in America too.
[0:26:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IMMIGRATION PENDING
[0:26:35] <butthurtdave> There was some prostitution bust in my podunk ass town like two years ago and it was the funniest thing ever. Hookers in a cow town of less than 5000 people is really hilarious
[0:26:36] <%DesertPenguin> and the strippers can touch you
[0:26:37] <%VashyronM> Titties make men horny and is thus immoral and women serve to draw women toward immorality. Men are paragons...or some shit because we live in the fucking 1800's still.

[0:26:50] <Nenatab> If companies stopped censoring sexual themes nobody would need to complain about that type of censorship in the first place. It is not the customer's fault for wanting the product they are paying for to be untouched.

[0:33:31] <+Remery_> @zanzibar_junker unless it's hentai games
[0:33:32] <%trueherobappo> Or TOFU
[0:33:33] <EvanAlmighty210> nemesis

[0:33:55] <natebud> You think it's easy going to the penis doctor? Just wait until they get out the tiny vice.
[0:33:57] <FG_Leo106> Pat, imagine if a Sexy Doctor invites you to her place to play some... CVX

[0:36:05] <biomegabear> HI PAT
[0:36:05] <FG_Leo106> i personally think that the 2nd half of CVX is better but still the game aint good imo
[0:36:07] <%Mahatiggy> Mahatiggy subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:36:08] <%Capta1n_H3nry> 6 no doubt feels better to play
[0:36:12] <+Rishnix> Just got here. So am I at the beginning or end of the stream?

[0:36:30] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat you should have played darkside chronicals instead of CVX
[0:36:36] <+gustavozxd> RE3 looks nuts
[0:36:38] <%scaryboisupreme> I can't believe that Capcom has a life size Nemesis at the HQ now
[0:36:41] <+Rishnix> @RocketShot_ Nice. Thank you for the info.
[0:36:47] <+BionoidLCR> @Rishnix dude its 3:28 pm est he just started
[0:36:53] <%RocketShot_> 👍
[0:37:08] <ohgodscorpions> oxycontin takes care of that pat its fine
[0:37:11] <+gustavozxd> Capcom bio engineered an actual nemesis just for the game
[0:37:12] <+albedo455> and sauske on darkside in CVX
[0:37:19] <%dukenux> thats rad

[0:37:53] <%deviljhojho_> heeeey
[0:37:54] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Sounds almost similar to crazy talk
[0:37:55] <cureneckbeard> Jesus was already dead when the spear pierced his side. That's why they didn't have to break his legs so he would die before the Sabbath

[0:43:16] <%dukenux> turn on your flashlight, geez Kappa
[0:43:16] <biomegabear> I guess they expected you to keep the lighter
[0:43:17] <%MayorRev> Hey silent hill did the same thing Kappa

[0:43:21] <+machshop> bruh pick a start time

[0:43:21] <%adventurerjess> just a teeny dark
[0:43:21] <%ghostofsolomon> i thought the lines were the screen tearing up or something
[0:43:22] <BluBox> Squinting to see anything
[0:43:23] <%Jane_Lo> Like I'm pretty sure this is A PORT problem
[0:43:24] <+zanzibar_junker> GAME OF THRONES

[0:43:44] <%Agami23> wait, i fell asleep during the last stream. why the fuck does claire have tonfa???

[0:43:47] <ahmz1404> is there a whale in this room
[0:43:47] <+G_Thunders> Didn’t they want you to equip the lighter? To show off the fancy lighting or whatever
[0:43:47] <%dukenux> watch out for penis monsters
[0:43:52] <oniwahoo> Can't wait for the CVX remake with even more STEVE
[0:43:53] <%bigdumbidiotguy> sPoOoOokY

[0:44:11] <%Starwarp08> looks like mgs2
[0:44:11] <+SilverDevilfish> Kryptonite fog
[0:44:12] <mistageeza> this game is so dark that its subverting my expectations
[0:44:12] <%dukenux> knock off SH
[0:44:14] <natebud> And hides the untextured walls
[0:44:15] <oniwahoo> *Steve will also be even creepier
[0:44:16] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat Welcome to Silent Hill
[0:44:20] <oyyzzo> don't breathe that in
[0:44:22] <+gustavozxd> is it as bad as the green shit in 5 though?
[0:44:26] <FG_Leo106> i played CVX on Dolphin the other day and didnt looked like this tbh
[0:44:27] <%Kilagn> Says this right before entering a room filled with mist LUL
[0:44:29] <%Gogetta159> You can turn on the lights later
[0:44:32] <%adventurerjess> how else to make it spooky
[0:44:32] <Reaganball_Z> Imagine being a zombie in an Antarctic base that nobody even wants to bother nuking or anything
[0:44:33] <%Aydarkzero> it's shrouded in mystery
[0:44:34] <%jillvxlentine> they get up in a minute
[0:44:36] <+SilverDevilfish> "Can you solve may maze Claire" - Lex Luthor
[0:44:38] <$joylent_blue> Agami23 they are guns disguised as tonfas
[0:44:39] <+SilverDevilfish> ^my
[0:44:39] <ahmz1404> that smoke is from australia, sorry guys
[0:44:41] <natebud> Oh no. I hope they don't wake up.
[0:44:42] <%Jane_Lo> @FG_Leo106 same thing
[0:44:43] <TurtleButter> okay, pat.
[0:44:43] <%michingmallecho> apatSmug
[0:44:43] <%Basch71> the fart gas room
[0:44:44] <Fenlig> fart gas
[0:44:46] <%SilverFaustX> u can remove the green filter in re5
[0:44:48] <+TheDeadpoolDash> Good old video game fog. I remember those days.
[0:44:49] <%Aydarkzero> ahhhh a zombie
[0:44:49] <%dukenux> dark
[0:44:52] <%segonian> was it a single shell on the street?
[0:44:52] <Reaganball_Z> Boink
[0:44:53] <FG_Leo106> also yes CVX isnt a great looking game
[0:44:53] <rytisone> oh no, a zombie
[0:44:54] <Picia000123> HAHAHAA
[0:44:54] <%michingmallecho> Silent hill fog
[0:44:55] <biomegabear> boo?
[0:44:56] <%SoySocks> good afternoon pat and chat
[0:44:57] <+PanicSwytch> Maybe they tried copying the mist environment from Silent hill
[0:44:59] <+CloniiCory> Man, the guy in charge of the fog machine for the rave really went hard.
[0:45:00] <oyyzzo> u kno how it be
[0:45:02] <CassyASG> it wasn't like this on the ps2 version
[0:45:03] <mistageeza> its literally steve's fart gass
[0:45:04] <+Wablafarga> did you fly to silent hill?
[0:45:09] <Decimated_body> :/
[0:45:10] <Picia000123> AMAZING
[0:45:10] <ScreamLord> Why the fuck does a BOW gun need gunpowder?
[0:45:13] <mobiusnightshade> The RE/Silent Hill crossover nobody asked for.
[0:45:14] <oniwahoo> I love this knife tbh
[0:45:16] <%baronblank> just in, what'd i miss
[0:45:16] <%Conyst> Claire got a letter
[0:45:17] <natebud> Prepare for that exact scare at least 7 more times.
[0:45:18] <$joylent_blue> shank a bitch, Claire
[0:45:19] <%dukenux> Aaah, a MONSTER
[0:45:21] <%Aydarkzero> @ScreamLord to explode duh
[0:45:21] <%Starwarp08> remember kids, more zombies = more scary
[0:45:22] <Graxe_> Which is funny, because I think the fog disappears when the power's back on and the lights are working.
[0:45:23] <thatWaulfyguy> just checked out that game boy argument animation, that's some good shit
[0:45:24] <+DiabloDeAzul> GET THE AMMO
[0:45:25] <%michingmallecho> They did something weird in the ps4 hd version
[0:45:25] <+gustavozxd> RE5 without the filter looks stunning honestly, the game looks really pretty
[0:45:27] <AllTheZibas> Are those zombies mooing?
[0:45:27] <oyyzzo> br-br-br-br-br-br
[0:45:27] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat Pat this game fucking sucks
[0:45:29] <+CavemanInCave> prison fight the game
[0:45:32] <biomegabear> That knifer
[0:45:32] <%jillvxlentine> explosive arrows
[0:45:32] <+RenoDeGeneric> Why was this super remote artic base full of zombies again?
[0:45:32] <Graxe_> Or this room at least
[0:45:32] <ohgodscorpions> the duel uzis really bother me it just seems way too cheezy action movie and it ruins any semblance of survival horror
[0:45:33] <+WaywardSera> Claire "Dickstabber" Redfield
[0:45:34] <ahmz1404> wow knife is op
[0:45:36] <$shadow1man9> MENACING
[0:45:40] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Prison Break 2
[0:45:42] <Ner234> Is the knife good in CVX? Why is Pat using it?
[0:45:43] <%Darthwaffler> I wish Steve was a zombie, then he would be the die
[0:45:43] <happyface699> It’s basically black and white
[0:45:44] <%adventurerjess> claire stabbin those dicks
[0:45:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> cut your shit
[0:45:44] <%michingmallecho> Best knife for best girl
[0:45:45] <Reaganball_Z> Oh shit
[0:45:46] <AllTheZibas> MOOOOOOOO
[0:45:49] <%trevsded> they sound so sad
[0:45:51] <%MayorRev> moooo
[0:45:51] <%thegreatbambe> Look into his eyes, you only see pain
[0:45:52] <%Starwarp08> i assum ORC is next
[0:45:52] <apolitenoob> It's goin great, I see
[0:45:52] <+DRAGKUDO> can we get some cows in the chat
[0:45:53] <biomegabear> @Ner234 yes
[0:45:54] <Picia000123> It would be really funny if Pat died from this
[0:45:55] <+PanicSwytch> Good ol' dick slice
[0:45:55] <%trevsded> sad zombie cows
[0:45:59] <%rickyjones47> Knife seems buggy as fuck. 10 hits in 1
[0:46:01] <mistageeza> riveting gameplay
[0:46:03] <GameOver_Here> Which is worse this or Zero?
[0:46:03] <+saadi90> Gameplay!
[0:46:04] <+RenoDeGeneric> Knife was the best it had ever been in CV until the RE2 frame thing
[0:46:06] <%michingmallecho> Castrating zombies. It’s the only way
[0:46:08] <+Cory_the_Dinosaur> 🐄
[0:46:08] <oniwahoo> @starwarp08 If only
[0:46:11] <+Exyoh> I was about to say that the zombie's hat falling off was impressive for the time, but I can't let the game win
[0:46:12] <+johnny_gogo> knife wife OP
[0:46:13] <%trueherobappo> Why are you swiping at their feet?
[0:46:14] <%baronblank> @AngriestPat is this the worst game on the initial list for the RE marathon?
[0:46:16] <mistageeza> we're gaming u guys
[0:46:21] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat I don't think a RE game has ever been this boring to watch for me
[0:46:22] <%Conyst> this is worse
[0:46:22] <natebud> Were you scared chat?
[0:46:24] <+TheDeadpoolDash> Camera angles have always been the scariest thing in the RE games. Can't see where the bad guys are at.
[0:46:25] <%42nfl19> Is @AngriestPat suppose to have a flashlight or lighter for these sections?
[0:46:29] <$joylent_blue> trueherobappo makes 'em fall down
[0:46:35] <%michingmallecho> How about this...RE6 or Code Veronica?? apatSmug
[0:46:38] <%trueherobappo> @joylent_blue That's stupid.
[0:46:40] <%Aydarkzero> is damage to the player random like in 3?
[0:46:43] <+Remery_> more hungry than scared
[0:46:44] <ohgodscorpions> MIGHT
[0:46:45] <biomegabear> The lighter
[0:46:45] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @42nfl19 yes but he is a poopman
[0:46:46] <+Drfunkenstein7> vidya game
[0:47:00] <%jillvxlentine> he doesnt have the lighter anymore
[0:47:01] <%Gogetta159> I feel the need to say this is the shitty PS2 version of the game and not the HD version which was much brighter
[0:47:04] <Reaganball_Z> Probably not. I see people gooed to the wall all the time
[0:47:04] <$joylent_blue> that rat is strong
[0:47:05] <mobiusnightshade> A monster might have been the killer, because we can't rule out fucking Spider-Man apparently.
[0:47:06] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> RATTO
[0:47:06] <Miss_Ebola> CHOESE
[0:47:06] <%Starwarp08> AAA sound quality
[0:47:07] <XelGel> ratto
[0:47:08] <natebud> yeah fuck you too buddy
[0:47:09] <rytisone> feisty rat
[0:47:12] <%SoySocks> is it true that Code Veronica was going to be RE3, but then it was decided that Nemesis would be 3 instead?
[0:47:13] <+Jaysky> Rats rats
[0:47:13] <%Agami23> bye clemps
[0:47:14] <+Exyoh> That's a good rat
[0:47:15] <%NovaKnightmare> I smoel choese
[0:47:16] <Picia000123> You would think they would do it in reverse
[0:47:16] <AllTheZibas> Oh sheeet a rat!
[0:47:16] <oyyzzo> wow
[0:47:16] <+gustavozxd> the guy from Kim Possible
[0:47:17] <%rickyjones47> Pale rat
[0:47:20] <munchkay> Rattatooio
[0:47:20] <%michingmallecho> That rat
[0:47:21] <Kiraklene> Rats, rats we're the rats
[0:47:21] <%Wrashis> why do i remember there being weird swarms of flies around here?
[0:47:23] <%Starwarp08> fucking hate rats
[0:47:25] <%bigdumbidiotguy> that was that damn monkey squirrel from Deadly Premonition
[0:47:26] <oniwahoo> CVX Knife Claire is needs a greater challenge
[0:47:28] <%Gogetta159> That rat has a name and is a full character
[0:47:30] <%jillvxlentine> theyre moths
[0:47:33] <%Quigsies> Clemps?
[0:47:34] <%Conyst> RE6 is worse because it's jrpg length
[0:47:36] <+TheDeadpoolDash> That SMASH envelope
[0:47:37] <natebud> @Wrashis prepare for moths
[0:47:37] <%Starwarp08> READ THAT FILE
[0:47:39] <michingmallecho> our dear alexia
[0:47:42] <+HouseofNonsense> Hey dudes, hey Pat
[0:47:42] <%Gogetta159> He shows up in like 5 different areas
[0:47:44] <%Jane_Lo> @Wrashis in a next few corridors, but yes they are in this area
[0:47:44] <$joylent_blue> blah blah blah ALEXIA, blah blah blah
[0:47:46] <ahmz1404> i'm guessing this doesnt have a graphics mod
[0:47:53] <%mistermastergreg> @AngriestPat So you can't see anything? is this how Paige feels like?
[0:47:54] <%adventurerjess> LORD
[0:47:56] <Miss_Ebola> @Gogetta159 When's he getting a card in Teppen?
[0:47:58] <%Aydarkzero> was the Rat the Butler monkaS
[0:48:00] <%Wrashis> ok im not crazy. i guess i made it passed this part
[0:48:00] <oyyzzo> your enthusiasm is palpable
[0:48:00] <natebud> Moths are the worst enemy in any RE game. They're just poison crows.
[0:48:25] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Poison Crows monka@
[0:48:32] <biomegabear> I try to have as much room as I can
[0:48:34] <mobiusnightshade> The rats, the rats~ We're the rats~
[0:48:42] <%Starwarp08> did u play re2 with the updated graphics?
[0:48:43] <Graxe_> Code Veronica has the worst moths, but I still like their Hunters the best.
[0:48:49] <InvisibleMan101> jermaRat jermaRat jermaRat
[0:48:52] <%AncelDeLambert> but they fluffy
[0:48:59] <oniwahoo> Are the moths better than a giant scorpion tho?
[0:48:59] <%Starwarp08> machine learning
[0:49:00] <%valriot> They just want lamp
[0:49:04] <%rickyjones47> Moths freak me out irl
[0:49:09] <munchkay> but they are super cute
[0:49:16] <%adventurerjess> and soft
[0:49:19] <dan_g_v> that buttler dude sounded british, or irish
[0:49:22] <mobiusnightshade> @valriot In this area, everyone wants lamp.
[0:49:23] <%bigdumbidiotguy> moths eat doodoo
[0:49:26] <oniwahoo> damn
[0:49:32] <%trekkie11041> BUT ELEIMINATORS
[0:49:32] <%jillvxlentine> and leave babies on your back
[0:49:36] <%FacetiousAF> but what if there was a mothman
[0:49:36] <Fujiwara_92> damn
[0:49:48] <$joylent_blue> can't see shit
[0:49:49] <%Gogetta159> The Rats name is D.I.J and he has a file you can find in the battle game
[0:49:50] <+HouseofNonsense> Sure is grey
[0:49:53] <Decimated_body> is code veronica the last tank control game in the resident evil series? not counting 4 ofcourse
[0:49:54] <lithogensnake> Respawning enemies in this game are the fucking annoying.
[0:50:02] <%Starwarp08> looks like silent hill 2 HD
[0:50:02] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Decimated_body 0 is
[0:50:05] <mistageeza> moths are a failure of the game designer
[0:50:11] <%bigdumbidiotguy> stuart little you absolute fucking cretin I hate u
[0:50:18] <biomegabear> FUCK THESE THINGS
[0:50:19] <+ChiefWilly> D: Watch out!
[0:50:19] <TurtleButter> probably due to somewhat rushed development, to hide the low quality textures? I dunno
[0:50:21] <%rickyjones47> RE with a Silent Hill filter
[0:50:23] <dan_g_v> infinite enemies are the worst
[0:50:26] <%Starwarp08> GET REKT
[0:50:26] <FG_Leo106> these Early Dreamcast Real time 3D backgrounds aged like shit tbh
[0:50:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Decimated_body RE5 also has tank controls, but also dual stick
[0:50:30] <%passthehanky> this is a great time to have a moth phobia
[0:50:40] <biomegabear> And you can kill it
[0:50:42] <+SilverDevilfish> they haven't stopped with the tank controls, they just shifted to a view that works better
[0:50:43] <%Jane_Lo> @TurtleButter it's the HD version that does this, dreamcast port sure looked fine
[0:50:44] <mistageeza> just like real life
[0:50:44] <%FacetiousAF> oh its elmo
[0:50:45] <biomegabear> but it respawns
[0:50:45] <%Gogetta159> THese moths nearly ruin every run
[0:50:46] <natebud> And it has a command grab
[0:50:46] <%trueherobappo> at the same time?
[0:50:47] <%Wrashis> this is where i stopped i think
[0:50:48] <%jillvxlentine> only the babies on your back can poison you
[0:50:49] <%bigdumbidiotguy> it's just those big moths from DS2
[0:50:49] <+Remery_> the piss vapors
[0:50:49] <%trueherobappo> Oh no
[0:50:57] <%michingmallecho> Life sucks and then you die🌝
[0:50:59] <$joylent_blue> they knew it was a problem
[0:51:00] <Picia000123> You should go to the doctor if your piss is posion gas
[0:51:01] <$joylent_blue> and just left it
[0:51:01] <munchkay> Breakdown Breakdown Breakdown
[0:51:03] <biomegabear> Why not just take it out of the game
[0:51:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah
[0:51:11] <%Wrashis> and i didnt see the herbs i guess
[0:51:13] <FaytLeingodz> why not just remove it...what a hassle
[0:51:14] <%Starwarp08> i see no problem
[0:51:16] <%Aydarkzero> nah leave it Kappa
[0:51:16] <%takiyami> Enemy variety yo
[0:51:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> enemy type quota?
[0:51:17] <%Mr_Pylon> time
[0:51:18] <+CavemanInCave> now flip off the camera
[0:51:20] <%Starwarp08> shut up though
[0:51:21] <+gustavozxd> pat there's no time
[0:51:21] <%jillvxlentine> to take your other healing items and to piss u off
[0:51:21] <%Gogetta159> They also attach a baby on your back that doesnt do damage till a few screens later
[0:51:24] <jjjkopf> at least they aren't Cazadors
[0:51:28] <%Jane_Lo> are they infinite though???
[0:51:28] <%FacetiousAF> this is turning into a deconstruction of why CVX is shit
[0:51:31] <%bigdumbidiotguy> tell us how you really feel, pat
[0:51:31] <+zanzibar_junker> yo pat been watching Cocokiryu stream Yakuza 7 and it's looking god
[0:51:34] <+Exyoh> Gotta show off the particle effects on this tech demo of a game
[0:51:36] <ScreamLord> Moooooo
[0:51:40] <%iggdrafolium> Is like they didn't care at all! Crazy right?
[0:51:40] <+HouseofNonsense> Has Pat shot a single bullet that wasn't against a Bandersnatch?
[0:51:40] <+Mitchellsocks> This knife sounds like the uncapped FPS RE2make knife
[0:51:43] <Decimated_body> HOT TAKE code veronica is better than res 0
[0:51:48] <apolitenoob> MoooooOOOoOOOo
[0:51:51] <%Darthwaffler> MOOOOooooo
[0:51:54] <natebud> You'd think there'd be some music here or something
[0:51:54] <%bigdumbidiotguy> "the cow says"
[0:51:55] <Picia000123> Why do you gotta turn this shit on first, it should be the other way around
[0:51:59] <Ner234> Betterer
[0:52:00] <%michingmallecho> They probably spent a long time programming and said “well we can’t just take it out” and hence the blue herbs🌝
[0:52:01] <%scaryboisupreme> ain't the knife the best ever in CVX
[0:52:03] <lithogensnake> Infinite herb glitch is the best way to suffer through this
[0:52:08] <%Wrashis> @HouseofNonsense he shot a couple dogs and then knifed them when they fell over
[0:52:08] <%jillvxlentine> get ready for spiders
[0:52:11] <biomegabear> Im bad with the knife though
[0:52:22] <$joylent_blue> his pathing's not great ok
[0:52:22] <munchkay> It is ended, better-er
[0:52:26] <%AncelDeLambert> can't see SHIT
[0:52:26] <%jillvxlentine> which are hard to kill funny enough
[0:52:29] <%rickyjones47> That machine gun knife man
[0:52:30] <AutechreTwinAphex> the game was outsourced to a Sega subsidiary called NexTech - Capcom did not make this game other than faxing them some concept art and design ideas
[0:52:34] <+SilverDevilfish> Why bite her when I can just walk into her
[0:52:36] <Artista_AF> that sounds like a "we don't have time to redesign the whole thing, so we will just rush a solution"
[0:52:36] <+HouseofNonsense> @Wrashis lol
[0:52:37] <Graxe_> The fact that the RE2 Remake knife needs the high framerate to be better makes it worse than Code Veronica's knife.
[0:52:39] <%passthehanky> wtf is with this it is SO dark
[0:52:40] <+zanzibar_junker> I have to pull the blinds to see this shit heap game
[0:52:40] <%trueherobappo> YO HORIZON ZERO DAWN IS THE SHIT
[0:52:41] <biomegabear> Theres a speed run achivement for this game and I dont know why?
[0:52:45] <%Starwarp08> i imagine this is similar to watching how sliced turkey is made
[0:52:54] <%bigdumbidiotguy> theres no music
[0:52:58] <%Aydarkzero> but it's scary!
[0:53:00] <mobiusnightshade> Gee. It's almost like slashing apart muscles and tendons is more effective against zombos than merely perforating them. Kappa
[0:53:01] <%Wrashis> not a 1 music
[0:53:05] <%jillvxlentine> spiders!!!!
[0:53:05] <+hopsoverfrogs> betterer...wtf stay in school kids
[0:53:06] <biomegabear> Could the dreamcast not do FMV?
[0:53:08] <$joylent_blue> LMAO
[0:53:12] <%Gogetta159> Easier to make
[0:53:13] <AutechreTwinAphex> well compared to PS1 Dino Crisis graphics, this was super high detail back then
[0:53:15] <%Aydarkzero> why is it zooming out!
[0:53:15] <Ner234> Spider WutFace
[0:53:16] <%passthehanky> camera???

[0:53:22] <%jillvxlentine> grenade launcher for the
[0:53:24] <%rickyjones47> Giant garden spider
[0:53:26] <%bigdumbidiotguy> at least the music made backtracking around the older games less of a hassle
[0:53:31] <biomegabear> RE1 spiders are back
[0:53:31] <Dragovus> Well fuck my donkey
[0:53:32] <+CloniiCory> I'm only able to keep up with the DARKNESS because my TV is pretty bright.
[0:53:32] <%Gogetta159> But then they went right back to prerender backgrounds right after this game
[0:53:35] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> welp
[0:53:35] <%passthehanky> is this game just freaking the fuck out bc of camera angles or enemies
[0:53:35] <FG_Leo106> RE Outbreak Real time 3D backrounds looks like 50 times better than CVX's

[0:55:05] <lithogensnake> People forget before REmake the classic formula was being handled like garbage.

[0:55:25] <oniwahoo> SOUL CRUSHING
[0:55:26] <FG_Leo106> Re0 has the best Pre-Rendered and Gif backgrounds of the series, too bad the game sucks. its a shame

[0:55:29] <Picia000123> There was nothing you could do Kappa
[0:55:30] <%GunEden> you chose this
[0:55:30] <munchkay> Let's just say you did your best, and skip to REmake
[0:55:32] <%MayorRev> There's a super exploitable skip in this section: turn off the game and boot up RE4
[0:55:33] <+StooEsq> You can tell CVX is actually making Pat genuinely annoyed, because he's actually quiet

[0:55:55] <CassyASG> didnt someone say this game was easy its not
[0:55:56] <mistageeza> fun fact : they used turtle mating sounds for these enemy types
[0:55:59] <%jillvxlentine> theres some more things as well that you missed down by the zombie on the floor i think
[0:56:00] <%scaryboisupreme> Court did a great job
[0:56:06] <Picia000123> Pat is done
[0:56:06] <%wsintai> wsintai subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 10 month streak! I'm always happy to watch Pat play his favorite RE game. I can't believe some idiots think RE2 is better than this masterpiece
[0:56:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> this game does the same lame scare tactic over and over again
[0:56:09] <%michingmallecho> What’s so bad about RE0, I started it recently and got past the train. Haven’t gone further than that yet
[0:56:10] <oniwahoo> @mayorrev Easily the best way to play the game
[0:56:16] <+HouseofNonsense> I miss Alyson Court as Claire

[0:56:59] <Serge_12> ResidentSleeper
[0:57:03] <cant_pick_a_name> the Wesker parts are the best and even those are dumb
[0:57:04] <%Taisuru> Steve is pretty cool
[0:57:05] <$joylent_blue> michingmallecho i think it comes down to item management being tedious and enemies are annoying
[0:57:05] <%takokasa> tomatoRat
[0:57:06] <%JJCheeker> This game does a lot of things over and over and over
[0:57:09] <%theKingRamses> @42nfl19 there was a reason they changed the names around
[0:57:11] <+Vermunder> Always goods to join a stream and the first thing you hear is about ass sucking. Thanks Pat
[0:57:16] <%bluebiscuit94> Loosing your cool
[0:57:16] <Hellarussian> Steve is cooler than Leon
[0:57:18] <tuesti> why is steve the worst? i acutally don't know anything about this game
[0:57:19] <%Aydarkzero> does the story in this game even matter?
[0:57:28] <+Mitchellsocks> Steve Burnside should be shoved in a locker
[0:57:28] <FG_Leo106> im glad CVX became the Spin off. its so bad and weird that dont deserved to have 3 in the title
[0:57:33] <biomegabear> Does RE0 Need a remake?
[0:57:35] <%CrimsonCore90> So is this the one where you couldn't finish it because you left the magnum it Antarctica?
[0:57:37] <+CavemanInCave> RE 8 is steve backstory
[0:57:39] <%rickyjones47> What RE is after this one anyway?
[0:57:49] <+Mitchellsocks> 0
[0:57:52] <%jillvxlentine> @tuesti steve has bad voice acting and says some really cheesy crap
[0:57:55] <+Cory_the_Dinosaur> doesthe story in any game matter?
[0:58:00] <%michingmallecho> If they remade RE0 and Code Veronica, that’d be cool
[0:58:08] <%michingmallecho> I like Rebecca apatSmug
[0:58:09] <Graxe_> If you didn't keep the extinguisher from the beginning, you can't get the magnum in Antarctica, yes.
[0:58:10] <%wsintai> This is actually the prequel to RE9
[0:58:10] <Hellarussian> Steve is the pin holding up the RE franchise
[0:58:12] <oniwahoo> @tuesti Also trying to kiss Clair in her sleep isn't helping
[0:58:13] <+Mitchellsocks> When REREmake
[0:58:18] <natebud> Steve in the linchpin to this all.
[0:58:22] <rytisone> Steve matters
[0:58:23] <tuesti> @oniwahoo oh no
[0:58:26] <FG_Leo106> @cory_the_dinosaur without spoiling, the ending connects directly to a later RE
[0:58:31] <StromkoPenguin> Bad voice acting and cheesy lines? That never stopped RE before
[0:58:31] <Serge_12> @angriestpat Good thing they switched names and RE:CV became a spinoff pianodUrien pianodUrien pianodUrien
[0:58:33] <Dragovus> This was the return of Wesker
[0:58:35] <$joylent_blue> tuesti he's an immature idiot who thinks he's the coolest thing ever, also he tried to kiss Claire in her sleep and felt her up when she fell
[0:58:36] <%BioHunter> only thing that matters is wesker
[0:58:38] <%rickyjones47> Is 0 better than this? Never played it
[0:58:41] <munchkay> I was going to say, why didn't you play DMC2 if you're playing this? But DMC2 is just the worst kind of worst
[0:58:49] <+CavemanInCave> they gonna remake dino crisis then re 1 then re 8
[0:58:55] <tuesti> @joylent_blue wthhhh
[0:58:57] <%BlankKhun> Steve needs a cameo in the next RE, where it is revealed he runs a political podcast
[0:58:58] <+MogarEpoch> MogarEpoch subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:59:02] <%michingmallecho> DMC2 is straight up boring bad though
[0:59:08] <+CloniiCory> RE8 is about Ashley Weekend at Berniesing Steve's skeletion. 10/10 concept.
[0:59:08] <%jillvxlentine> i think sony wanted 3 resident evils on their console but i could be wrong
[0:59:11] <+HouseofNonsense> Steve "Nheh my daddy" Burnside
[0:59:11] <%Wrashis> you would think they looked at it and were like yeah make the other game 3
[0:59:12] <%valriot> I can see Sony being that much of a prick
[0:59:14] <%Taisuru> YOU
[0:59:15] <%Chatterbox1991> YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
[0:59:18] <%MayorRev> MOTHMAN
[0:59:19] <mistageeza> ah shit, here we go again
[0:59:20] <%Aydarkzero> YEAH
[0:59:21] <FG_Leo106> Real talk. which one is worst Code Veronica or 0?
[0:59:21] <%takokasa> Oh no, now you're MOTH PREGNANT
[0:59:22] <Zekuu69> enbBlock
[0:59:22] <Fujiwara_92> UUUUUUUUUUU
[0:59:23] <%bluebiscuit94> UUU
[0:59:24] <SMuffinMan> people that say this game is better than 3 baffle me
[0:59:25] <biomegabear> that thing lays eggs on you
[0:59:27] <Hellarussian> souljaboy tell em
[0:59:27] <Ner234> Ban mothman
[0:59:28] <+albedo455> then 4 was GC first
[0:59:30] <+saadi90> Uuu
[0:59:30] <%JJCheeker> Claire looks like she had wings for a second
[0:59:31] <Graxe_> Poisoned when it hatches
[0:59:31] <%MogarEpoch> Is RE4 next?
[0:59:31] <%Taisuru> MOTHMAN ON STREAM
[0:59:35] <AllTheZibas> MOOOOO
[0:59:35] <Graxe_> And it stays on you across rooms
[0:59:36] <Picia000123> Boo haunted house noises
[0:59:37] <%michingmallecho> The mothman prophecies
[0:59:40] <%Aydarkzero> if re0 did get remade should it have co-op is the real question
[0:59:45] <Dragovus> Slice and dice, my brother
[0:59:48] <anAngryHamster> Can't see shit captain
[0:59:50] <Graxe_> These moths suck ass
[0:59:51] <%Gogetta159> Yeah it should
[0:59:51] <%trueherobappo> apatBig Brave
[0:59:55] <%bluebiscuit94> FUCK
[0:59:55] <rosabellamelantha> Can't see fucking anything
[0:59:57] <biomegabear> mothman in game
[0:59:59] <%trueherobappo> You can do it brother.
[0:59:59] <darthriven501> fuck
[0:59:59] <Graxe_> More than the few you find in RE2
[1:00:00] <Fujiwara_92> Cow zombies
[1:00:01] <%michingmallecho> RE4 remade in the RE engine...oh baby apatGib apatGib
[1:00:02] <rosabellamelantha> can we PLEASE skip this one
[1:00:05] <munchkay> @mogarepoch REmake 1 is next i believe
[1:00:05] <natebud> Find a room with lighting and check Claire's model for egg.
[1:00:05] <oniwahoo> I would like for Steve to make a cameo appearance in RE8 and it be revealed he somehow survived only to get eaten by zombies or something
[1:00:07] <mistageeza> sounds like my visit to the penis doctor
[1:00:11] <%jillvxlentine> i miss elmo
[1:00:12] <+DiabloDeAzul> Pat needs to work on his footsie games
[1:00:15] <%BlankKhun> Actually, wonder if RE3R is gonna still have the annoying rng elements
[1:00:16] <$joylent_blue> remember when people wanted him to play CVX
[1:00:16] <CassyASG> pat you have plenty of ammo why!?
[1:00:17] <%Mr_Pylon> epic low visibility battle
[1:00:19] <$joylent_blue> i remember
[1:00:21] <Fenlig> Zombies making some big sex noises
[1:00:21] <%MogarEpoch> @munchkay thanks bb
[1:00:23] <%bluebiscuit94> apatBig GREAT
[1:00:28] <%dukenux> :(
[1:00:34] <SuperHoppedUp> I would rather watch the water pump puzzle
[1:00:35] <+chase959> Hey saw the podcast before I started my iceborne pc run about and like to thank you for saving 220 hours of my life
[1:00:42] <%michingmallecho> I feel like REmake doesn’t need a reremake though. HahaBall
[1:00:44] <cant_pick_a_name> wait what???
[1:00:45] <%Gogetta159> RE has way too many side characters that just disappear forever
[1:00:49] <%Wrashis> if they remade 0 and they could only include one change would you prefer an item box or scenarios instead of constantly switching characters? @AngriestPat
[1:00:51] <%eiightbiitt> where is emlo?
[1:00:53] <oniwahoo> @joylent_blue Honestly, I didn't remember it being this rough at all
[1:00:54] <rytisone> cheap bastard
[1:00:55] <%theKingRamses> wait what
[1:00:55] <rosabellamelantha> why are the spiders even in this game, this isn't even the right fucking umbrella lap
[1:00:55] <Graxe_> And there's a third spider you can't kill under the floor
[1:00:56] <%bluebiscuit94> WUT?!
[1:00:56] <+Mitchellsocks> There's no Steve Burnside, you gotta be kidding me, I got boxes full of Steve! All right, so I start marching my way down to Alexia in H.R. and I knock on her door and I say, "Alexia, Alexia! I gotta talk to you about Steve!" And when I open the door, what do I find?
[1:00:57] <rosabellamelantha> lab
[1:01:17] <Dragovus> From under the floor, really?
[1:01:17] <+CloniiCory> Resident Evil Remake REMAKE would be some top tier meta 200 iq play by Capcom.
[1:01:18] <$joylent_blue> chase959 damn, lucky PogChamp
[1:01:18] <AutechreTwinAphex> I really don't want any more remakes after 3 - after 3 any interesting lore or story is gone anyway
[1:01:21] <%eiightbiitt> !uptime
[1:01:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 1m.
[1:01:24] <Graxe_> Yep, under the floor
[1:01:28] <Fujiwara_92> oooo man
[1:01:31] <Graxe_> That's why you always hear one
[1:01:31] <%passthehanky> i'd be okay with an RE engine remake of 1
[1:01:31] <SuperHoppedUp> @rosabellamelantha there are spiders all over the place
[1:01:32] <+Cory_the_Dinosaur> @chase959 HahaSweat
[1:01:33] <natebud> There is no alexia @Mitchellsocks
[1:01:33] <CassyASG> you didnt bring heals?
[1:01:40] <oniwahoo> @chase959 Nice
[1:01:49] <%Gogetta159> I want to see what Capcom does with RE8 after RE3make
[1:01:50] <+chase959> @joylent_blue are you an unfortunate soul?
[1:01:53] <%dukenux> is this entire area that dark?
[1:01:54] <%michingmallecho> I’d still buy a RE1 done in the RE engine. yeeSip
[1:01:59] <%jillvxlentine> yeah i
[1:02:02] <+mystery_flower> is CVX really that bad or just bad for RE games
[1:02:06] <%jillvxlentine> yes*
[1:02:07] <+Dre_> @autechretwinaphex What if they did 1 again
[1:02:07] <Graxe_> The sticker is for that box, yes
[1:02:09] <%Wrashis> i think i never got to this box
[1:02:09] <AutechreTwinAphex> I know a lot don't want them to go back but I'd really like to see RE8 return to firstperson and VR again
[1:02:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> NO DONT
[1:02:19] <$joylent_blue> chase959 no thank god, i'm on ps4 BlessRNG
[1:02:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> NOT THAT BOX
[1:02:21] <%Jane_Lo> @mystery_flower it's not bad. it's just fine
[1:02:26] <%Gogetta159> CVX isnt that bad its just tedious and long.
[1:02:31] <Graxe_> It is
[1:02:31] <biomegabear> This looks like you're doing someoes job
[1:02:37] <+Mitchellsocks> Tedious, long, and hideous
[1:02:43] <SuperHoppedUp> I want RE8 to just be punching
[1:02:49] <$joylent_blue> LUL

[1:02:57] <Graxe_> The box will return if you don't use that sticker on that box because the sorter doesn't know where to send it
[1:02:58] <oniwahoo> Chat is not to be trusted
[1:02:58] <%jillvxlentine> it goes on that box what you talking about
[1:02:59] <$joylent_blue> the duality of twitch chat
[1:03:03] <%crazy_laughter> WRONG BOX!
[1:03:04] <%Gogetta159> You totally do use it on that box lol
[1:03:04] <%Wrashis> dont worry pat, 4 ppl said yes that box, and one guy said no @AngriestPat
[1:03:06] <%dukenux> WHATS IN THE BOX?
[1:03:07] <%jillvxlentine> there are no other boxes
[1:03:07] <%valriot> One guy LUL
[1:03:07] <%michingmallecho> RE8 having Chris and Jill on a adventure together again would be nice. Just like old times with two REALLY REALLY GOOD FRIENDS HahaBall
[1:03:08] <natebud> I think that delivers BOW gas to the room you just killed all the spiders in.
[1:03:09] <biomegabear> Chat is good 65% of the time
[1:03:09] <AutechreTwinAphex> back in the day most of these complaints didn't bother me but maybe it was the graphics at the time that didn't make it seem so bad
[1:03:10] <%Mr_Pylon> Damn you, One Guy!!
[1:03:11] <cureneckbeard> one guy
[1:03:11] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> yovgLUL

[1:03:19] <AutechreTwinAphex> in retrospect though it's bad yeah
[1:03:20] <Ner234> Always sometimes never trust chat Kappa
[1:03:21] <%bluebiscuit94> I WANT RE8 TO BE A FIGHTING GAME says Woolie
[1:03:23] <%wsintai> Its never a bad time to drink amirite

[1:03:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I just wanted to troll our favorite PAt lol
[1:03:37] <%Ixiah> just buy a drinkhat with 5 monster cans
[1:03:37] <%dukenux> Why not get drunk BEFORE you play CVX
[1:03:41] <%BlankKhun> Boxes do nothing but hold you back
[1:03:42] <Decimated_body> I can't see shit
[1:03:44] <cureneckbeard> literally can't see anything
[1:03:46] <+Roundelay11> god, those moans
[1:03:47] <%valriot> Because the game lacks any real threat or urgency
[1:03:48] <%crazy_laughter> The user must be nearby
[1:03:49] <+Cory_the_Dinosaur> you drink to numb the pain
[1:03:49] <%BioHunter> can't see shit
[1:03:49] <natebud> Because the game is so slow and boring that it felt like a lull where you could get away with drinking @AngriestPat
[1:03:52] <%jillvxlentine> oh yeah pat should get drunk for one of his streams
[1:03:53] <%Darthwaffler> Replace the RE knife with a Virtua Fighter low punch
[1:03:58] <AutechreTwinAphex> the knife is more overpowered than RE2 Remake's knife at 120fps LOL
[1:04:00] <%dukenux> Can see shit, cap'n
[1:04:02] <%happyface699> I CANT SEE
[1:04:04] <%PunishedMercer_> this guy moaned at least this loud.
[1:04:06] <%Hilleltaco> this is the stance
[1:04:07] <%SilverDevilfish> Wow it's like playing Skyrim with one of those stupid "realistic dark" mods
[1:04:07] <%dukenux> can't
[1:04:09] <oyyzzo> zombie moans Kreygasm
[1:04:09] <DracaenaLeaf> HAHAHA
[1:04:09] <$joylent_blue> PATHING
[1:04:10] <biomegabear> I dont remember it being this dark on the 360 version
[1:04:11] <Decimated_body> BLACKOUT
[1:04:12] <Picia000123> This is so stupid
[1:04:14] <Fujiwara_92> DARKNESS ALL THAT I SEE
[1:04:16] <%Ixiah> but the tv is perfectly calibrated
[1:04:16] <cureneckbeard> HIDEO
[1:04:18] <%michingmallecho> I didn’t even touch resident evil games until RE4. I just knew it as the zombie game with unwieldy controls. Then I bought RE0 for the GameCube along with 4🌝
[1:04:24] <AutechreTwinAphex> this area honestly looks so much like that bad game Blue Stinger
[1:04:24] <%wsintai> IMPRISONING ME
[1:04:26] <%dukenux> this is ASMR stream at this point
[1:04:26] <cureneckbeard> blindfolded kakyoin "I see"
[1:04:29] <%crazy_laughter> ABSOLUTE SAVINGS
[1:04:30] <+StooEsq> Can't see shit, captain
[1:04:32] <Zekuu69> He cant see neither
[1:04:32] <%BioHunter> emulator problem?
[1:04:38] <$joylent_blue> puke noises
[1:04:40] <CassyASG> this would be less tedious if he just shot them
[1:04:44] <%happyface699> @crazy_laughter Can’t believe the price
[1:04:46] <+Jonami90> Wow, you weren't kidding about the knife in this
[1:04:50] <%passthehanky> @BioHunter it's ps4
[1:04:50] <%BlankKhun> No, the game is actually just this dark
[1:04:51] <%jillvxlentine> check those lockers
[1:04:51] <mistageeza> its not dark enough for my taste
[1:04:51] <%michingmallecho> God damn that’s dark
[1:04:53] <happyface699> YOU PAY
[1:04:58] <+mystery_flower> i can get CVX on offer for £10 rn and idk if i should pay that or they should pay me
[1:05:01] <%Gogetta159> I will never get people who cant use tank controls
[1:05:03] <natebud> Someone asked how the music was in this game. I ask that person, what music?
[1:05:03] <%michingmallecho> It’s like you can’t go blacker than black
[1:05:07] <%jillvxlentine> the assault rifle pat!
[1:05:11] <%happyface699> NOTHING CAN SAVE YOU
[1:05:13] <%42nfl19> Pat said that it is possible to turn on the lights. Is he not there yet? Cause what would be the point of the lights AFTER you traverse something?
[1:05:14] <SMuffinMan> this game is so much worse than I remember
[1:05:15] <%jillvxlentine> WAIT
[1:05:17] <Graxe_> Oh right, there's a thing in those lockers on the right
[1:05:19] <darthriven501> HEAT THE KEY
[1:05:22] <%jillvxlentine> THE ASSAULT RIFLE
[1:05:27] <Graxe_> The weapon lockers
[1:05:28] <%wsintai> @42nfl19 To mock you
[1:05:29] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat You've got the key to the pachinko mines, now you can save the Konami employees
[1:05:33] <%Ixiah> omg the locker :D
[1:05:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FREEZE AND THEN HEAT THE PAL KEY
[1:05:36] <%happyface699> apatDab

[1:05:57] <%D3rrtyD4n> this sucks atpRtsd

[1:06:09] <%Chatterbox1991> HEAL PAT
[1:06:10] <%happyface699> Can’t believe I beat this
[1:06:14] <+shatteredsaint> moths are assholes
[1:06:15] <%jillvxlentine> you can pick it up as claire
[1:06:18] <%jillvxlentine> and leave it for chris
[1:06:19] <$joylent_blue> the biggest ass
[1:06:23] <%CrimsonCore90> The most dangerous enemy...a moth!!
[1:06:24] <%Gogetta159> I would just shoot them and save yourself the trouble
[1:06:24] <%michingmallecho> Now I’m imagining this section with a flashlight like how the RPD dark hallways were done in R2make. Now I really want a CVX remake
[1:06:26] <cureneckbeard> see what
[1:06:29] <%jillvxlentine> ASSAULT RIFLE
[1:06:29] <%dukenux> well...
[1:06:32] <+Roundelay11> did you ever think you would have to suffer through CVX again?
[1:06:34] <munchkay> It really does
[1:06:34] <%Wrashis> the assault rifle apparently
[1:06:35] <biomegabear> ASSULT RIFLE

[1:06:51] <%Skittlesoul> no i can't see anything this game is so fucking dark
[1:06:52] <%trekkie11041> @jillvxlentine needs the lighter
[1:06:52] <%happyface699> IT SUCKS
[1:06:53] <%jillvxlentine> ITS IN THE LOCKER

[1:11:42] <oniwahoo> I can't believe that Jill Valentine knows what's up in a Resident Evil scenario
[1:11:42] <$joylent_blue> to be fair Claire would freeze to death in what she's wearing
[1:11:46] <+Remery_> or yetis
[1:11:48] <Fenlig> Zombie Polarbears?
[1:11:49] <AutechreTwinAphex> D2 on Dreamcast did snow well
[1:11:51] <cureneckbeard> they should just occasionally have her be like, "brr!"
[1:11:52] <+Cory_the_Dinosaur> @oyyzzo but this game is Japanese
[1:11:52] <Arek_1> That would be gross. Kappa
[1:11:54] <%JJCheeker> What's in the box

[1:12:06] <%BlankKhun> Zombies trudging through 20ft snow would've been funny
[1:12:06] <%dukenux> nothing
[1:12:07] <%Gogetta159> Revelations is great until you arent playing Jill
[1:12:08] <%CrimsonCore90> Have there been zombie Orcas? That would be really cool
[1:12:12] <%Tearonex> Man would've loved to kill zombie peguins

[1:12:31] <%Aydarkzero> hmm
[1:12:31] <%Wrashis> well rev2 was made much later, to be fair

[1:12:46] <biomegabear> Who worked on code veronica?
[1:12:47] <oniwahoo> Rev2 was a solid experience
[1:12:52] <%theKingRamses> or compare it to re3
[1:12:54] <%takiyami> Just from a design perspective too
[1:12:55] <%bigdumbidiotguy> CoolStoryBob
[1:12:55] <AutechreTwinAphex> it was made by NexTech - this entire game was an outsource job
[1:12:56] <%dukenux> i think switching to 3d enviroments really gimped them
[1:12:59] <+reycharles75> if only the rev2 had online coop
[1:12:59] <+gustavozxd> now i want to play rev2
[1:13:00] <Graxe_> Oh, the mining room was downstairs. The machine room's up here.

[1:14:46] <%Darthwaffler> I looks like you're under water
[1:14:49] <JoeBecomesJoe> She forgot to bring octagon
[1:14:49] <RichardButt1> is lisa a mummy
[1:14:50] <KaijuVania> this is absolutely stunning
[1:14:55] <%mistermastergreg> @AngriestPat Where is Elmo?
[1:14:59] <%dukenux> whoa
[1:15:00] <AutechreTwinAphex> RE3 aged much better
[1:15:04] <$joylent_blue> what a good camera angle
[1:15:05] <SocialMisfitGamer> WOW
[1:15:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> understandable
[1:15:09] <%bluebiscuit94> Oof this camera angle
[1:15:10] <%Mr_Pylon> what's happening?
[1:15:11] <djazo> well time changes people LUL
[1:15:15] <FG_Leo106> you turn lights on in this room iirc
[1:15:17] <%jillvxlentine> in my unbiased opinion re3 is awesome
[1:15:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you were young, you didn't have a good enough frame of reference.
[1:15:21] <chambatron> Pat: "They don't think it be like it is, but it do"
[1:15:21] <%Wrashis> this is the first time ive heard you loved this. i guess by the time of the channel youd realized it was garbage.
[1:15:22] <oyyzzo> now you're like this is the sickest shit ever
[1:15:26] <SocialMisfitGamer> YES THEY ARE
[1:15:29] <+Roundelay11> PUP SNUFFERS
[1:15:47] <KaijuVania> i cant see shit honestly
[1:15:48] <SocialMisfitGamer> EWW
[1:15:54] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat Part 1 of this game was kinda meh but this is BAD, the game just got REALLY bad after the tyrant
[1:15:54] <%bluebiscuit94> Surprise dog
[1:15:55] <natebud> what was that dog doing?
[1:15:57] <%lethallunacyx> Yeah same for me, watching Max play made me realize this one is not so great.
[1:15:57] <ha2ken> Camera shift is jarring
[1:15:57] <Hal10k> So you only loved this game because it was Resident Evil but WOW 3D?
[1:15:58] <%enickma11> Oof
[1:15:59] <Deadbulky> THe godknife
[1:15:59] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat but Pat, zombies MADE the game.
[1:15:59] <oniwahoo> Bork Breaking: Knife edition
[1:16:01] <Fenlig> Those were just normal dogs
[1:16:01] <biomegabear> Also the Moth hallway cuts as you run into it which sucks
[1:16:06] <%jepupu> Better not show this to the can-you-pet-the-dog twitter
[1:16:16] <AutechreTwinAphex> I guess over the shoulder cameras before RE4 all sucked
[1:16:18] <FG_Leo106> RE3 is as good as RE2 imo
[1:16:22] <RichardButt1> is Lisa Trevor a mummy
[1:16:24] <%Wrashis> the shifting was probably them trying to use some money, but if they wanted to show the money, there shouldnt be 5 other instant transitions in this room @AngriestPat
[1:16:28] <%Mr_Pylon> please tell me there are lights now that the power is on
[1:16:32] <rytisone> and then they were like "shit, it's gotta be over the shoulder camera from now on"
[1:16:32] <thewhiterice92> What was that dog doing while his friends were fighting
[1:16:34] <SocialMisfitGamer> It does, and that is a terrible idea
[1:16:35] <+Xevtes> stabbing those zombie dogs somehow feels worse than shooting them
[1:16:36] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> It makes sense
[1:16:38] <%bluebiscuit94> Early 3D movies made the same kind of mistakes IMO
[1:16:38] <%Gogetta159> You're probably right about that one Pat
[1:16:40] <natebud> Yes it does, after the fact direction
[1:16:43] <AutechreTwinAphex> with camera angles like this you might as well do it pre-rendered
[1:16:46] <%bigdumbidiotguy> the whole big thing about Resident Evil CV was that they were bringing in actual zombies to make the game @angriestpat
[1:16:50] <%jillvxlentine> so they didnt build the rooms around camera angles they built the camera angles around the rooms?
[1:16:51] <$joylent_blue> the lights are on and i didn't even notice
[1:16:55] <biomegabear> @AngriestPat Is the rail shooter for code veronica better than the game?
[1:16:56] <%rickyjones47> Are they?
[1:16:56] <+CloniiCory> Nobody working on this game understood good blocking it seems.
[1:16:56] <Deadbulky> How hard would the game be Pat if the knife wasnt op?
[1:16:57] <+SlappyMeats> which honestly should still work, but not if no foresight is applied
[1:17:04] <%dukenux> another problem is that youve been playing it for like 20 minutes? and it feels like nothing happened
[1:17:05] <%Mr_Pylon> bullshit the lights are on
[1:17:07] <+DlGi_> there are lights
[1:17:10] <+DlGi_> ?

[1:18:27] <%antshadow14> apatSmug
[1:18:28] <AutechreTwinAphex> LOL the environments look like something the N64 could have done
[1:18:29] <mobiusnightshade> Oh, I saw THAT part, yeah. Your rendition of SPEEN was quite spoy-on.
[1:18:31] <%Wrashis> its not even the look of it that triggers me, its the walking noise with clearly no foor movement
[1:18:33] <%bread_assassin> How does it look in RE3 when you spin in place?
[1:18:34] <Juilce> looks fine
[1:18:38] <%bluebiscuit94> What year did CVX come out?
[1:18:44] <%passthehanky> the atmosphere is way better with music but wow the environments are still boring as fuck
[1:18:46] <%dukenux> 2003?
[1:18:49] <%Gogetta159> Pat don't they just rotate like that in RE2?
[1:18:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> Hey how long has Pat actually been playing the game? (Not pre-game chat)
[1:18:49] <oyyzzo> 2001?
[1:18:51] <$joylent_blue> bluebiscuit94 2000
[1:18:51] <+SlappyMeats> what's weirdest is that she is in fact picking up her heels, so they did actually pay attention to some kind of animation, but it still looks like nothing
[1:18:54] <cant_pick_a_name> god there's still so much game left too
[1:18:55] <%BlankKhun> There are a ton of games where you can spin like that, tho
[1:18:57] <darthriven501> ?????
[1:18:57] <AutechreTwinAphex> @bluebiscuit94 Code Veronica came out in 2000 - CVX about a year later but it's nearly the same game
[1:18:58] <%bigdumbidiotguy> @angriestpat not everyone can make RE2 again pat. I mean they had literal zombies making the game
[1:18:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> Also notkohWave chat
[1:19:05] <%rickyjones47> Atleast its a bit better with the music
[1:19:07] <%jillvxlentine> that box is for chris i believe
[1:19:10] <%bluebiscuit94> Ooof, this is bad even for 2001
[1:19:12] <darthriven501> the fuck is going on here
[1:19:12] <EmpyreanMAULER> I thought I didn't see foot movement even tho I was hearing it hahah
[1:19:15] <FG_Leo106> also i found annoying how you can freely walk on stairs like in RE3 but for some reason only zombies can do it CVX lol
[1:19:18] <%CrimsonCore90> So 2001, near Metal Gear 2?
[1:19:19] <Graxe_> And there's the magnum
[1:19:19] <oniwahoo> A fIrE?!
[1:19:20] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpCap what do now?
[1:19:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> CVX was 2004 wasn't it? Cause it was a remake.
[1:19:22] <FG_Leo106> cant*

[1:20:38] <djazo> this game gets worst and worst LUL
[1:20:39] <+HouseofNonsense> In nature, it is common for the giant moth to engage in the act of "stun locking" and "cheek-clapping".

[1:21:59] <deswescappy> this game is amazing
[1:22:00] <%trekkie11041> i actually really like nosferatus boss theme
[1:22:02] <buffmurffy> what a twist
[1:22:02] <%dukenux> stare down into CBT dungeon
[1:22:04] <Oxybe> le gasp!
[1:22:05] <%Tracazoid> Pat's Silent Hill would be Code Veronica
[1:22:05] <xvalltendo> No joke, when i watched my mom play this game she thought the nosferatu was actually Chris
[1:22:05] <+nwo_angel_101> leave the grenade launcher for Chris
[1:22:05] <djazo> @deviljhojho_ peek survival horror is RE1 REMAKE
[1:22:06] <SuperHoppedUp> A secret facility put a fucking key under their planter?

[1:22:08] <AllTheZibas> i did...
[1:22:10] <+professormorrigan> is this better than Resident Evil 6 :)
[1:22:11] <natebud> I can't believe someone hid a key in the only item in the room. The inginuity
[1:22:11] <%trueherobappo> this game is now called silent evil

[1:22:32] <%bluebiscuit94> Silent Evil: Resident Veronica
[1:22:33] <apolitenoob> Resident Hill, definitely

[1:22:51] <%BlankKhun> Evil of the Hill
[1:22:52] <%Wrashis> its this small and i couldnt even finish it
[1:22:54] <natebud> And it still feels way too long somehow
[1:22:56] <%heroicspiritavenger> Cloaca and Ball Torture

[1:23:03] <rytisone> the WHOLE stream for this section, huh?
[1:23:04] <%bluebiscuit94> Resident Veronica: Evil Hill
[1:23:06] <+SlappyMeats> the fact that you haul off and go to god damn Antarctica in the first place is a joke
[1:23:07] <darthriven501> silent resident
[1:23:08] <$joylent_blue> the only game my mom ever played was mario kart 64, she still remembers rainbow road
[1:23:08] <%dukenux> Silent Evil: DownVeronica
[1:23:15] <%takiyami> I now totally want a RExSH crossover called Silent Evil. It has to be at least as good as Cross Tekken and I won't complain.
[1:23:19] <%deviljhojho_> the horror element of this game is how long it takes to beat
[1:23:22] <+SlappyMeats> it's like ax cop, written by a 5 year old
[1:23:27] <lithogensnake> I don't understand how people say this should've been RE3 over Nemesis
[1:23:37] <+HouseofNonsense> Resident Hill: Veronica Coming...wait.
[1:23:38] <%Skittlesoul> what's the deal with the empty fire extinguisher in the case
[1:23:38] <FG_Leo106> Same
[1:23:56] <buffmurffy> probably graphics for the time
[1:24:02] <Glaicus> How much forward is this game like a year or two?
[1:24:05] <Glaicus> in the timeline*
[1:24:06] <rytisone> eehehehe
[1:24:06] <+SlappyMeats> Nemmy's my sexy boy slappy2Happy
[1:24:07] <%Wrashis> i mean wesker is cool
[1:24:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpRtsd
[1:24:07] <+shatteredsaint> @lithogensnake because it was supose to be 3 and 3 was going to be a spin off but their deal with sony meant they had to swap them
[1:24:10] <%dukenux> the graphics were impresdive for the time, and takes storyboutta Racoon City
[1:24:12] <%trekkie11041> nosferatus cool tho
[1:24:14] <+professormorrigan> 🐬
[1:24:14] <%deviljhojho_> crikWorm
[1:24:14] <SailingSaturn> Love Ya Alfred cirREE
[1:24:16] <%deviljhojho_> crikWow
[1:24:19] <FG_Leo106> this looks like a spin off, it has dumbed down gameplay, looks bad and its boring
[1:24:20] <+CloniiCory> Also Jill > Claire. We all know I'm right.
[1:24:20] <%Conyst> couple months forward
[1:24:21] <%bluebiscuit94> What if we dubbed Alfred over Nemesis?
[1:24:22] <%takiyami> The mainline RE story has been shit since 3 anyways. RE4 might as well be a spinoff just in terms of canon.
[1:24:26] <oniwahoo> Just wait til RE3make has the CVX knife to use against you
[1:24:27] <Graxe_> Oh no
[1:24:28] <+SlappyMeats> behold, the worst character in Resident Evil!
[1:24:29] <%Skittlesoul> kill him

[1:24:37] <xvalltendo> @KaijuVania she had me at a fairly young age so when I was little I used to watch her play the RE games a lot. it's one of the reasons I love the series so much.
[1:24:37] <JoeBecomesJoe> Look at the nerd neck on schteve
[1:24:38] <%dukenux> STFU STEVE
[1:24:40] <darthriven501> why does re4 fell like a side story so hard
[1:24:42] <$Jmann1892> Nosferatu, Alfred, and Wesker are not enough to carry this game
[1:24:43] <absdaddy> this dialogue
[1:24:43] <+CavemanInCave> they might have a chance...
[1:24:44] <Glaicus> NO WAY LADY YOU'LL ONLY SLOW ME DOWN!
[1:24:44] <%Nope80808> You know what would make this game 10/10? If all the music was just Down With the Sickness by Disturbed.
[1:24:44] <natebud> This shit, you thought steve wasn't bad enough
[1:24:45] <Graxe_> If you wall hug it, you can get the valve handle before triggering Steve
[1:24:47] <%rickyjones47> Digging vehicle

[1:25:05] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol

[1:25:06] <%Shadowpint> What were you going to say before Steve rudely interrupted you

[1:27:04] <Dragovus> The Moths are masters of DO COMBO
[1:27:04] <%deviljhojho_> oh no no no
[1:27:08] <StromkoPenguin> At what point does it become worthwhile to just shoot the moths? Do they respawn or something?
[1:27:11] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat I think the game is "BUGGED" cirDerp
[1:27:11] <+StooEsq> Where's a flamethrower when you need it?
[1:27:14] <%AmericanaRed> MOTHMAN
[1:27:15] <%BlankKhun> Man, all that could have been avoided by dodging
[1:27:18] <+professormorrigan> Does this game have any cool monstar designs
[1:27:18] <ShadowZiggy> I love video games
[1:27:18] <$joylent_blue> the moth wants to offer you an egg in these trying times
[1:27:19] <%jillvxlentine> they always respawn because its a nest
[1:27:19] <%rickyjones47> Umbrella should of just made more moths to kill everyone
[1:27:22] <indig0bird> I feel the series can't stop shitting on one of their best characters to suck Chris and Leon dick
[1:27:27] <Graxe_> See, this gas is fine because it's BOW gas
[1:27:27] <munchkay> @sailingsaturn LUL LUL LUL
[1:27:27] <%FirearmsInstructor> @commanderclaw FeelsOldMan .jpg
[1:27:28] <%Mr_Pylon> Need Moth emote for patmad

[1:27:44] <%Wrashis> oh you
[1:27:44] <%bluebiscuit94> Thats useful
[1:27:45] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> har
[1:27:46] <AllTheZibas> On replay he says
[1:27:47] <+terlerkun> REPLAY
[1:27:49] <KaijuVania> music reminds me a little of T2
[1:27:51] <%Nope80808> Capcom still at it with the fucking grabsboid. They crammed a version of those in MHW as well.
[1:27:53] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I know I would @wsintai
[1:27:54] <absdaddy> good one
[1:27:54] <Oxybe> anti bad odor?
[1:27:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> HahaCat
[1:27:55] <MoonObscure> reeeplayyy
[1:27:58] <%XeroSigmaPrime> How does a toxic gas kill BOWs but not Jill?
[1:28:02] <buffmurffy> you joke, but isnt this a replay?
[1:28:04] <natebud> best joke is the fire extinguisher.
[1:28:07] <SMuffinMan> FUNYYYYYY JOKE
[1:28:08] <%dukenux> Everybody laugh. Curtains.
[1:28:09] <Doomguy137> The only thing claire has nowadays is her cat, Albert Whiskers
[1:28:11] <%Aydarkzero> stay tuned for Pat's replay of cvx in 2024 when the remakle comes out Kappa
[1:28:16] <cureneckbeard> it's anti-bow gas, not anti-claire gas
[1:28:17] <$joylent_blue> lmao
[1:28:19] <Oxybe> reverse fart gas?
[1:28:23] <natebud> BOW's hate green, claire loves it
[1:28:24] <StromkoPenguin> It doesn't seem to be killing the BOWs either, maybe it's just really ineffective
[1:28:25] <AutechreTwinAphex> deep lore
[1:28:26] <indig0bird> I just think Jill is consistently a good caring charaacter but they always go back to the beefcake or Leon
[1:28:27] <rytisone> claire is not a bow
[1:28:27] <+professormorrigan> redfield bloodline is immune
[1:28:31] <indig0bird> I'm ok with Leon tho
[1:28:36] <+SlappyMeats> the gas is made of human, so it make human stronger
[1:28:38] <munchkay> Protag Armour!!
[1:28:41] <%michingmallecho> Leon, why don’t you want to make super babies. Leon apatFist
[1:28:43] <ohgodscorpions> how does chocolate kill dogs but not humans
[1:28:44] <AllTheZibas> That we know of
[1:28:44] <Deadbulky> Inject me with the fart gass
[1:28:45] <%jepupu> Wow the moth room gets a lot of use
[1:28:45] <%takiyami> The Redfield bloodline is too strong
[1:28:45] <CassyASG> lololol
[1:28:46] <%dukenux> Redfield Bloodline is strong
[1:28:46] <oniwahoo> I really don't like Leon
[1:28:49] <+CavemanInCave> the ultimate bio weapon
[1:28:49] <lithogensnake> She is to Steve
[1:28:58] <%D3rrtyD4n> its like pesticides, perfectly safe for human consumption LUL
[1:29:00] <%aeravon> Dat booty is a bio organic weapon
[1:29:03] <Lionkevinson> Oh Steve....
[1:29:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @ohgodscorpions Chocolate can kill humans
[1:29:06] <%Taisuru> More like bio orgasmic weapon right steve?
[1:29:06] <+Remery_> why can't Wesker have kids?
[1:29:07] <AutechreTwinAphex> is there no way to avoid getting hit by the moth?
[1:29:09] <+arancet> c'mon, claires related to chris, shes at least a little bit of a bioweapon
[1:29:10] <+nwo_angel_101> Before you fight the boss, leave handgun ammo and the grenade launcher in the item box. Use explosive bolts to fight the boss.
[1:29:12] <biomegabear> I dont know this game says no
[1:29:13] <indig0bird> True!
[1:29:15] <%michingmallecho> I’ll take Leon over steve any day of the week
[1:29:15] <Lionkevinson> She has big butt
[1:29:16] <+professormorrigan> leon, impregnate my sister 😡
[1:29:16] <%dukenux> Jill and Leon are my fav protags actually
[1:29:19] <Deadbulky> Rebbecca tho
[1:29:19] <%deviljhojho_> LEGENDARY game RE4
[1:29:21] <AxelCezar> everyone loves claire, and jill
[1:29:21] <%dukenux> Claires fine too
[1:29:22] <+CloniiCory> @indig0bird I feel like they are scared of moving her story along past 5 for some reason, even though there's alot you can do with her overcoming all that Wesker bullshit.
[1:29:22] <%Mr_Pylon> Claire got Steve
[1:29:25] <+machshop> Claire got a HUGE ASS in RE2make
[1:29:28] <bluefooddye1> Actually chocolate is dangerous for humans, you just need to eat a fuckton of it to have any effect
[1:29:30] <%deviljhojho_> And LEGENDARILY BAD game Code veronica
[1:29:30] <djazo> @remery_ wesker has kids LUL
[1:29:31] <Captain_Joe1911> jill and claire got buried
[1:29:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ohgodscorpions The toxic component of chocolate is theobromine. Humans easily metabolize theobromine, but dogs process it much more slowly, allowing it to build up to toxic levels in their system.
[1:29:35] <%bluebiscuit94> Give her RE8
[1:29:37] <kite1haseo> Barry didn't get a game tho :(
[1:29:37] <+SlappyMeats> This was Claire's game, and the Chris stomps in on it halfway through
[1:29:38] <%Wrashis> i thought you were gonna say claire got stuck with the shit guys
[1:29:39] <biomegabear> DOES CLAIR NEED MORE PLAY?
[1:29:40] <%dukenux> but Claires game SUCK
[1:29:41] <AutechreTwinAphex> she got revelations 2 as a mid 30s hag
[1:29:41] <natebud> Fuck off this game takes place three months after RE2! Claire is 19 @AngriestPat
[1:29:48] <+HouseofNonsense> I'm STILL shocked Claire wasnt in RE6 at all
[1:29:49] <Graxe_> Also a good game for Barry
[1:29:51] <%deviljhojho_> yeah moira and barry kicked ass
[1:29:51] <+G_Thunders> When Chris shows up here Claire literally becomes helpless and I hate it
[1:29:52] <%wsintai> When are we gonna be playing Megan Man Revalaitons on here?
[1:29:53] <+Remery_> @djazo that bald kid?
[1:29:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ohgodscorpions It's like heavy metals for humans. (Lead, etc)
[1:29:57] <Deadbulky> Rebecca got deleted
[1:30:00] <%MayorRev> @AngriestPat Barry got his own game?
[1:30:01] <%Shadowpint> I really hope Barry is in RE8
[1:30:01] <%scaryboisupreme> I wonder whatever happened to Billy
[1:30:01] <+Eddy21forsaken> Rev2 is a Moira game Kappa
[1:30:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> what was Barry's game? not Revalations
[1:30:02] <%BioHunter> claire and jill. need more ppay
[1:30:02] <%BlankKhun> I'd be fine if Chris never appeared again
[1:30:03] <%dukenux> PogChamp
[1:30:04] <%Agami23> pat, you need to open the sloose
[1:30:04] <%MayorRev> which one?
[1:30:06] <%Dementedpenguin> Barry was fucking great in Revelations 2. That ending sequence. Beautiful.
[1:30:06] <djazo> @angriestpat well barry was the star of rev2
[1:30:06] <absdaddy> Barry got GAIDEN
[1:30:09] <+machshop> whaddya think of it?
[1:30:09] <Kouseo> need more rebecca
[1:30:09] <LunarRemix> Wesker never got his game
[1:30:10] <%GunToad> We will never see Billy again FeelsBadMan
[1:30:12] <KaijuVania> Revelations 2 is fun.
[1:30:13] <+arancet> still need to make it up to jill for re5
[1:30:14] <djazo> @remery_ yes
[1:30:15] <%jillvxlentine> barry is old man coolness
[1:30:15] <AutechreTwinAphex> Rebecca starred as a 38 year old in that CGI movie
[1:30:15] <%MayorRev> ooooooooh
[1:30:15] <Deadbulky> FeelsBadMan
[1:30:15] <+ChiefWilly> Hunk game when?

[1:30:16] <%sporeian94> Becca got her own movie though
[1:30:17] <indig0bird> I mean, I don't think they're scared @CloniiCory , they just don't know what to do
[1:30:18] <+CloniiCory> Barry got a Gameboy game tho lol
[1:30:18] <%dukenux> was it good, or Barry good?
[1:30:19] <+Remery_> berry smells like roast beef and cigarettes
[1:30:22] <rytisone> Rebecca is damsel in distress
[1:30:23] <Lionkevinson> Barry?
[1:30:24] <Alluringcrest> Rebecca got her own movie LUL
[1:30:25] <%michingmallecho> I like a Chris but not drunk RE6 Chris. No no.
[1:30:26] <zayasu> FeelsBadMan
[1:30:27] <%Psych_man13_13> Do you think Capcom still hates Rebecca?
[1:30:28] <+CavemanInCave> fused with the trees
[1:30:28] <+SlappyMeats> Barry's game was RE: Gaiden falcMorty
[1:30:31] <%scaryboisupreme> HUNK really isn't a main character
[1:30:31] <+machshop> @Remery_ yes we know he's a MAN
[1:30:32] <Doomguy137> Whats with resident evil and 99% of the female characters get really bad games lmao
[1:30:34] <%DetroitSentai> I enjoyed Rev 2 as an episodic game a lot, but that's because i sunk a ton of time into raid mode
[1:30:35] <+HouseofNonsense> Hey now, Rebecca got a movie. A movie with shitty gun fu...
[1:30:38] <Alluringcrest> Too bad the BSSA kill over 4 million people in that movie
[1:30:38] <GameOver_Here> They got into Teppen tho
[1:30:39] <%trekkie11041> rebbecca was in the re vendetta movie
[1:30:39] <%scaryboisupreme> I can't see Hunk getting their own game
[1:30:40] <SMuffinMan> you mean Revelaitons
[1:30:41] <+CavemanInCave> SEAAANNN
[1:30:41] <Deadbulky> Barry everywhere system
[1:30:42] <%MayorRev> OH BARRY!
[1:30:46] <%dukenux> BERRY
[1:30:46] <SocialMisfitGamer> BARRY-SAN
[1:30:46] <Graxe_> If we're counting Gaiden, that's also Leon's game
[1:30:46] <oyyzzo> featuring the memorable character moira
[1:30:46] <%Taisuru> I hope this isn't CHRIS'S blood
[1:30:49] <xSHARKPUNCHx> rebecca was in one of the cgi movies
[1:30:50] <SuperHoppedUp> Angry Bear Chris in RE6 is pretty great
[1:30:51] <%MayorRev> That was TOO CLOSE!
[1:30:52] <%Shadowpint> Rebecca isn't very good IMO
[1:30:54] <%wsintai> When is the full retail priced Tofu game
[1:30:59] <Lionkevinson> Barry with that weird kid
[1:31:02] <BlueKaixa> Rebecca got to be in that one movie
[1:31:02] <AutechreTwinAphex> they did a weird shift with Rebecca too from RE1 to Remake - she became totally Asian
[1:31:02] <iamnotaparrot> Barry and Leon got Gaiden on GBC first
[1:31:05] <CassyASG> too close man!
[1:31:05] <%scaryboisupreme> Fuck it bring back Carlos
[1:31:06] <djazo> WATCH OUT BARRY THERE'S A MONSTER
[1:31:08] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat We might just have to accept that Billy and Rebecca just never really existed
[1:31:08] <%Chatterbox1991> Sheva is great
[1:31:11] <Kouseo> tbh the movie wasnt that bad
[1:31:14] <%Chatterbox1991> Josh is better
[1:31:14] <Graxe_> You need to cut the valve handle because it's the wrong socket
[1:31:15] <%Agami23> know what was a cool pull? alex wesker
[1:31:16] <rytisone> Rebecca became a basketball star Kappa
[1:31:17] <Kouseo> it could of been worse
[1:31:19] <%Aydarkzero> Sheva is cool
[1:31:20] <%MayorRev> Here's a lockpick
[1:31:21] <Deadbulky> Shevas cool
[1:31:22] <%scaryboisupreme> Carlos and Sheva should get a co-op game
[1:31:23] <%dukenux> i miss Sheva
[1:31:24] <+machshop> Sheva is cool and also hot
[1:31:29] <%Psych_man13_13> Man, whens Sheva's spin off game?
[1:31:29] <+Remery_> super hot
[1:31:30] <dalishprince> god i miss sheva
[1:31:32] <KaijuVania> reminder alex wesker is still inhabiting the body of that little girl
[1:31:32] <+SlappyMeats> Josh is a cool guy in RE5
[1:31:33] <oniwahoo> Didn't Rebecca appear in one of the live action movies and then die in the same movie?
[1:31:33] <+BionoidLCR> Kreygasm sheva
[1:31:33] <%dukenux> oh ya
[1:31:33] <savagedeviljayho> radical?
[1:31:34] <Lionkevinson> Sheva
[1:31:35] <darthriven501> @angriestpat didnt barry end up raising the antagonist from rev2
[1:31:36] <natebud> Ark Thompson though
[1:31:37] <%scaryboisupreme> Josh is cool yeah
[1:31:40] <%passthehanky> sheva fuckin rules she's cool and way hot
[1:31:41] <+HouseofNonsense> Man, Sheva's never coming back, is she? BibleThump
[1:31:41] <%dukenux> SHEVA HURRY
[1:31:42] <Fenlig> What if Sheva and tiny hate?
[1:31:43] <%BioHunter> I want a sheva jill team up
[1:31:43] <djazo> the second cgi movie is the good
[1:31:45] <Oxybe> billy and rebecca's fart gas induced hallucinations
[1:31:45] <Deadbulky> XD
[1:31:45] <+InuOblivion> Sheva best girl
[1:31:47] <%dukenux> CMON
[1:31:48] <lithogensnake> Sheva gets one reference in a letter in 6, it sucks
[1:31:49] <Graxe_> That's a square valve handle
[1:31:49] <Lionkevinson> Josh and Sheva
[1:31:49] <Fenlig> hat*
[1:31:50] <rcand9> has pat lost his tiny mind yet?

[1:31:52] <%michingmallecho> Who was Chris’ partner in Rev1? Oh yeah no one remembers either kaceyHEH HahaBall
[1:31:52] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Wrong shape valve
[1:31:53] <+CavemanInCave> i hope shes in 8 best female character in series
[1:31:55] <%Jane_Lo> Well it's a different Valve LMAO
[1:31:55] <biomegabear> YOU NEED SOMETHING ELSE
[1:31:56] <+machshop> at least we know Sheva's alive, probably
[1:31:56] <AutechreTwinAphex> I think Sheva was just put in there to address accusations of racism
[1:31:57] <+G_Thunders> You have to use the machinery to change the shape of the valve. I just beat this yesterday and that was the one puzzle I had to look up
[1:31:57] <munchkay> Bring back Sheva and Lucia Capcom!
[1:31:57] <%jillvxlentine> its still a square one pat
[1:32:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> not octagon
[1:32:02] <%takiyami> Wrong valve?
[1:32:02] <%scaryboisupreme> Actually you have to go get the valve carved to fit it @AngriestPat
[1:32:02] <%Jane_Lo> LUL
[1:32:04] <Deadbulky> Ooooooh no
[1:32:06] <+Eddy21forsaken> LUL

[1:32:12] <Deimos002> Jebaited
[1:32:12] <StarlitStunner> Does Wesker even know Sheva’s name
[1:32:12] <natebud> Shut up, find a lathe loser. Ha good joke CVX
[1:32:12] <AllTheZibas> Square cannot fit in circle
[1:32:13] <+CloniiCory> Sheva is stuck in the void along with Helena, Jake, and all the other forgotten characters.
[1:32:13] <%trekkie11041> i would have prefered the chris josh team up for re5
[1:32:14] <oniwahoo> @darthriven501 That's the bad ending
[1:32:14] <KaijuVania> nah you just suck Kappa
[1:32:15] <InvisibleMan101> you need octogon
[1:32:15] <%Mr_Pylon> More moths!
[1:32:17] <%crimsonharvest> is this game bullshit

[1:32:23] <Deadbulky> Back to the moth party cave
[1:32:25] <+BomaZero> geometry makes it better
[1:32:25] <%Agami23> pat, would you say 80% of sheva's hotness is the accent?
[1:32:26] <FG_Leo106> You need to find a new Valve Kappa
[1:32:26] <deswescappy> cvx baybeeeeeee
[1:32:26] <MoonObscure> LOL
[1:32:27] <%Tracazoid> CV has the best backtracking. Kappa
[1:32:29] <@commanderclaw> This game needs a remake
[1:32:29] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> RE: Backtracker
[1:32:29] <AutechreTwinAphex> you had a game with Chris the white guy killing black people as zombies and to offset the racism accusation they put an African girl in as co-op partner
[1:32:30] <%scaryboisupreme> wait did he examine the valve hole
[1:32:31] <absdaddy> what a great game
[1:32:31] <darkbotle> just why?
[1:32:32] <Graxe_> It's too much
[1:32:35] <%MayorRev> It's like a metroidvania! Kappa
[1:32:35] <+SlappyMeats> @trekkie11041 def
[1:32:36] <CassyASG> thats what RE games are lol
[1:32:38] <%jillvxlentine> yeah its the wrong shape
[1:32:39] <rytisone> play the benny hill theme
[1:32:39] <Dragovus> Back to the room with the zombie in the cage for a new crank hole
[1:32:39] <%BlankKhun> Code learning how shapes work
[1:32:40] <KaijuVania> i love when Pat gets annoyed/ angry
[1:32:43] <%scaryboisupreme> cause you need to examine it to know what shape to carve it into
[1:32:43] <oyyzzo> can your boredom survive this unending horror?
[1:32:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> A remake to surpass Metal Gear
[1:32:43] <$joylent_blue> i also vote for Teppen instead Kappa
[1:32:44] <djazo> running back in RE games was never this awful
[1:32:44] <%marsproject> I thought Pat liked back tracking?
[1:32:44] <biomegabear> BUT ITS 3D THOUGH SAID DEVS
[1:32:45] <enby_shout> pat no like recv
[1:32:46] <Graxe_> Too much busywork to extend the game length
[1:32:47] <Artista_AF> HahaReindeer
[1:32:47] <%Typhaeon> Oops, All Backtracking
[1:32:48] <%jillvxlentine> need to change it with the metal machine upstairs

[1:33:08] <biomegabear> THIS NEEDS TO BE REMADE SO CLAIR CAN HAVE 2 GOOD GAMES
[1:33:10] <ohgodscorpions> super veronica troid
[1:33:10] <Deadbulky> Been down that moth halway like 6 times in the past 15 mins
[1:33:12] <+SlappyMeats> @trekkie11041 well wait, nah the RE5 teamup was fine, but it would have been rad to have Josh show up in RE6 and erase Piers from history
[1:33:13] <%takiyami> Wasn't it Matthewmatosis who did a breakdown of the map design and determined that it was just a giant corridor?
[1:33:14] <oyyzzo> wonder where steve-o went
[1:33:18] <+CavemanInCave> youre spoiled on the good RE's
[1:33:19] <%Aydarkzero> ugh
[1:33:20] <%dukenux> although Silent Hill nailed it in the first game
[1:33:20] <AutechreTwinAphex> don't remake it - make a new game
[1:33:23] <Lionkevinson> Shut up
[1:33:25] <rcand9> sounds like you aren't having fun Kappa
[1:33:27] <+G_Thunders> If this was your first Dreamcast game I can understand why people loved it.
[1:33:28] <%jillvxlentine> you fight him as chris dont worry
[1:33:31] <%DetroitSentai> this is silly
[1:33:31] <biomegabear> At least now you can see
[1:33:32] <natebud> Look on the bright side, you're almost half done.
[1:33:33] <%MayorRev> oh wow thats clever
[1:33:33] <djazo> @angriestpat but this the best RE PAT Kappa
[1:33:36] <%Theycallmenerf> Hello again stream. I just got back from the vets office with Naomi’s ashes. She’s finally home again.
[1:33:37] <%Wrashis> i would have never throught of that
[1:33:39] <%MayorRev> just SHAVE IT OFF
[1:33:43] <%trekkie11041> @SlappyMeats fair i just personally dont like sheva
[1:33:45] <%MayorRev> thats smart
[1:33:47] <$MildConviction> power through it, pat. think of REmake.
[1:33:48] <AutechreTwinAphex> why remake something that has a bad foundation? just make something new
[1:33:48] <%jillvxlentine> you fight him as chris
[1:33:50] <KaijuVania> dude Code Veronica Remake will be amazing calebPog
[1:33:50] <Graxe_> Yeah, he's stuck in there
[1:33:55] <%MayorRev> lemme in
[1:33:58] <ohgodscorpions> dont worry pat 9nce you get through this you get to play 4

[1:34:02] <%Psych_man13_13> So what your saying Pat is that ORC is better than this?
[1:34:02] <Dragovus> He's saving himself for Chris
[1:34:03] <Graxe_> And zombies are back
[1:34:08] <%dukenux> that looked like a zombine
[1:34:13] <+professormorrigan> Will Ashford's dolphin laugh be in the remake?
[1:34:15] <FG_Leo106> the difference with RE2 and 3 is that if they Remake this. they should replace most of the boring warehouses and training facilitie, fix the annoying backtracking and make the game actually good
[1:34:15] <Lionkevinson> Veronica, I love you
[1:34:17] <munchkay> That's Aric Andre
[1:34:21] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @AutechreTwinAphex let's be honest, when we mean remake, we mean make the whole game over from scratch, but better.
[1:34:22] <%Jane_Lo> @Psych_man13_13 hell no?
[1:34:28] <oniwahoo> God, I really wanted ORC to be amazing
[1:34:29] <$joylent_blue> he's doing REmake and Zero before 4

[1:34:50] <lithogensnake> Is there a place now for Revelaitons 3?
[1:34:52] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Zaphire_Saucypants I get it but unlike RE2/3 there is no interesting lore or setting here - what could a remake of this bring to the table? the environments suck, the characters suck
[1:34:52] <+SlappyMeats> stop it furry birds!

[1:35:01] <oniwahoo> @joylent_blue If I remember correctly, yes
[1:35:02] <%BlankKhun> Outbreak needs a remake, but since Project Resistance is a thing that seems more and more unlikely
[1:35:06] <rcand9> hes getting big mad
[1:35:07] <djazo> i mean RE2 holds up really well and it.s like 5 year older then this game LUL
[1:35:08] <Lionkevinson> Nice
[1:35:09] <%michingmallecho> These grunts
[1:35:10] <AxelCezar> how many tives have you walked through that corridor???
[1:35:10] <%scaryboisupreme> that moth is our old partner ya know
[1:35:10] <+CavemanInCave> they should just remake every RE including survivor and dead aim
[1:35:17] <Graxe_> Putting the valve is a point of no return, I think
[1:35:19] <%FirearmsInstructor> Pat: "I'm not mad. I'm not mad." *HE'S SUPER MAD*
[1:35:21] <natebud> How do you remake a game that has like no redeemable qualities?
[1:35:22] <Deadbulky> Let the hate flow through u pat
[1:35:22] <Graxe_> So take what you need

[1:35:51] <%Mr_Pylon> apatBig moth apatBig mad
[1:35:52] <+Trulawjick> Pat your rage snorts are making me uncomfortable
[1:35:54] <AutechreTwinAphex> you're going to run into diminishing returns too if you just keep remaking every one of the old games - RE has to continue moving forward to survive
[1:35:54] <%passthehanky> that's not even a hard call
[1:35:56] <rcand9> cant you wait to play it again as chris?
[1:35:56] <%Jake_Protagonist> I geniunely love RE1 still
[1:36:02] <%dukenux> yuup
[1:36:02] <%Jake_Protagonist> and I only played it laster year
[1:36:05] <rytisone> more than two weeks
[1:36:06] <FG_Leo106> I legit believes that Code Veronica and Re0 belows the OG trilogy
[1:36:07] <Deadbulky> I have my ps2 copy of code veronica still never opend it lol
[1:36:10] <%crimsonharvest> From now on I'm only going to be a fan of series that only improve in quality

[1:36:14] <+Gogglenator> What was the re4 spin off called
[1:36:16] <+BomaZero> @AngriestPat In 7th grade I wrote an entire journal entry over my hype for this game coming out on the dreamcast
[1:36:17] <Graxe_> RE1's great
[1:36:19] <+Gogglenator> similar to code veronia
[1:36:19] <@StridentSong> Look at those sick animations where Claire rocks back and forth slowly when a moth lands on her back
[1:36:20] <AutechreTwinAphex> with RE3 its' a good time to call it quits on the remakes and go back to RE8
[1:36:21] <%jillvxlentine> do you have herbs for this boss fight pat?
[1:36:24] <pixelandarilho> this is the first time i see someone playing RECV; is this one good or bad compared to the rest of the franchise??
[1:36:24] <+SlappyMeats> I do like that the knife is downright viable in this one
[1:36:29] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat the only tactic this game has is to rush you with zombies and it's boring as shit
[1:36:30] <jeffthesequel> Wow this game seems bad. Looks like I just dodged a bullet.
[1:36:40] <djazo> yes it RE1 get.s fucked by the remake but it's still great
[1:36:42] <%Tenchi_G> RE:CV gets a bad rep. it actually not bad
[1:36:44] <FG_Leo106> at least the mansion is nice to look at and the enemies are annoying like these stupid moths
[1:36:48] <%dukenux> @pixelandarilho overall so far: bad

[1:38:46] <%FirearmsInstructor> @machshop It's super good :)
[1:38:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you know, if they did remake this game, a nice lil twist would be that instead it was the sister crossdressing as the dead brother.

[1:43:51] <AutechreTwinAphex> i notice this just now - in RE3 Nemesis could grab you and there were unique animations for it - here it's just the default 'getting hit' animation that triggers on everything
[1:43:51] <%Theycallmenerf> I miss my cat.

[1:45:08] <%vectorless_peon> Is the grab just instant death?
[1:45:08] <%ElenaManetta> He does look KIND OF cool when you're just watching him stumble
[1:45:08] <%takiyami> Are there even any like sound mechanics since he's blindfolded?
[1:45:08] <try_it_sis_> uh oh ooh
[1:45:15] <Graxe_> It'd be a cool boss if the mechanics of the fight weren't what they were

[1:45:18] <Fujiwara_92> wait we playing silent hill now? wtf
[1:45:20] <AutechreTwinAphex> @michingmallecho yeah this is the part most people don't get - this is literally not even made by Capcom - and it shows
[1:45:22] <Renuarb> UH! UH! UH! UH!
[1:45:23] <%Wrashis> this is far from the end unfortunately

[1:45:50] <%shiplord13> Poison too
[1:45:51] <+G_Thunders> This sucks, don’t get me wrong. But are we really gonna pretend that “run away from the thing then auto-aim shoot” is great boss design? As with every other RE boss before this
[1:45:51] <Picia000123> A lot of money was thrown off the bridge for this game huh
[1:45:55] <%DesertPenguin> uhn uhn uhn uhn

[1:46:00] <CrypticMochi> HahaHide
[1:46:00] <%ElenaManetta> I dont understand what the grape soda is. Is he spitting at you?
[1:46:02] <AutechreTwinAphex> probably why that poison is so cheap too - why bother with unique attack animations when you can just cheap it out like this
[1:46:02] <%DesertPenguin> uhn uhn
[1:46:03] <%nathandiel> He’s just bad at this game
[1:46:05] <oyyzzo> jaws? LUL

[1:55:24] <zal_silverfang> backdown
[1:55:27] <%sporeian94> @miakhalifaisoverrated Pat hasn't had to declare Bankrupcy just yet
[1:55:27] <%Aydarkzero> so why the reset?

[1:55:44] <zal_silverfang> brain goblin time?
[1:55:45] <+nwo_angel_101> Before you fight the boss, leave handgun ammo and the grenade launcher in the item box. Use explosive bolts to fight the boss.
[1:55:46] <Graxe_> So if there's anything you don't want Claire to have, put it in the box before putting the valve handle in.
[1:55:46] <jellssssss20> Wait what
[1:55:48] <FaytLeingodz> @BionoidLCR i just looked it up, he gives u the lighter back if claired gave it to him

[1:55:50] <+officialprisonmike> @AngriestPat make sure to give all the shit to chris after nosferatu or your fucked.
[1:55:50] <%Dementedpenguin> I blame the Nintendo Direct.
[1:55:51] <AutechreTwinAphex> why the fuck does this game not warn you before that you need to leave your equipment in the box?

[1:56:54] <%Darren716> How far back did Pat have to go?
[1:56:55] <Deadbulky> Its the worst
[1:56:56] <%bluebiscuit94> pretty bad
[1:56:56] <%Sartastic> no
[1:56:57] <TioXyco> wait.... why you're so far back again?

[1:57:02] <Wan6Saber> ha
[1:57:02] <rcand9> awful
[1:57:03] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Counter hit Deathfist mental damage
[1:57:04] <%Jane_Lo> @jillvxlentine but he wants the chris part ot be easy, so he can complain bawkAy
[1:57:04] <%DesertPenguin> Did you and Matt do this one for the channel?
[1:57:07] <djazo> it least the should have thrown all of Clair.s weapons in the box LUL
[1:57:08] <CassyASG> but you knew tho
[1:57:09] <nepwar> players expecting a warning is a failure of the game design
[1:57:10] <rytisone> why did they respawn?
[1:57:10] <oniwahoo> That's rough
[1:57:11] <%jillvxlentine> you could of got them back later just not whilst chris is on the island
[1:57:11] <natebud> Yes, it's almost as if this game is terrible.
[1:57:12] <%Sartastic> its great game design!
[1:57:14] <oyyzzo> maybe
[1:57:14] <+Fyre_link> this game was never good, I hope a remake happens to fix the mess it made of itself
[1:57:15] <biomegabear> MORE REASON IT NEEDS A REMAKE
[1:57:17] <+Eiiriika> somehow its real easy to forget how bad cvx is
[1:57:18] <%JJCheeker> Can we talk about it dumb that hallway is
[1:57:21] <rcand9> my brother never beat it for the same reason
[1:57:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh my god Patrick! I thought you were dead!
[1:57:24] <Lionkevinson> Antarctica
[1:57:25] <tearsaurther> Just got here, what happened?
[1:57:26] <%Darren716> DesertPenguin They did it for a Shitstorm, played it for about an hour
[1:57:27] <Maxknightosb> happened 2 me as well
[1:57:27] <+professormorrigan> Is it worth remaking a garbage game
[1:57:28] <FG_Leo106> Terrible game desing yup
[1:57:29] <%StaceMcGate> "Code: Veronica released to critical acclaim; many critics believed it to be the best entry in the Resident Evil series at the time, and a "must-own" for the Dreamcast"
[1:57:30] <%happyface699> ITS AWFUL
[1:57:31] <AxelCezar> tomatoDisgust tomatoDisgust
[1:57:33] <+SlappyMeats> like there are definitely ways around it: maybe have a metal detector you have to go through to get to the digger, and the only gun you can get is Alfred's rifle?
[1:57:34] <%scaryboisupreme> Chris has to deal with way more annoying enemies
[1:57:36] <%DesertPenguin> This definitely is a Shitstorm
[1:57:41] <CoffeeSlice> I just hope the remakes somehow uncanon this game
[1:57:46] <%Sartastic> Bio pengins
[1:57:48] <%Aydarkzero> the game is literally saying "figure it out 4Head "
[1:57:52] <%dukenux> apatPorgmo
[1:57:52] <Mcgack2> thats what Chris gets the shotgun for
[1:57:52] <ohgodscorpions> you skipped the only good part 9f the game
[1:57:53] <%Dementedpenguin> apatPorgmo
[1:57:55] <rcand9> ii beat it because i was warned which is lame
[1:58:02] <FG_Leo106> i remember when that shit happened to me the first time i played CVX
[1:58:03] <%Darren716> How much progress did he lose? I came in late
[1:58:05] <%NovaKnightmare> Is Chris's Model a recolor of Wesker's in this game?
[1:58:07] <%Kegeto> did pat knife tthe boss?
[1:58:07] <djazo> @coffeeslice the remakes made this canon LUL
[1:58:08] <natebud> You easily can kneecap yourself by giving Claire all the good weapons before a boss fight. But that's how you're supposed to play RE.
[1:58:09] <%ranarath> And to think, this was originally gonna be labeled RE3.
[1:58:14] <%Sartastic> WHAT
[1:58:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> who is that chode?
[1:58:16] <%dukenux> LUL
[1:58:17] <+Eiiriika> FUCK OFF STEVE
[1:58:18] <%jillvxlentine> it is handy to have the GL for the spiders though
[1:58:22] <CoffeeSlice> @djazo aw hecc
[1:58:22] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Uncanon the game Capcom LUL
[1:58:27] <AutechreTwinAphex> nah the RE3 project was Devil May Cry
[1:58:29] <Graxe_> @tearsaurther Claire's items don't get moved to the item box when you switch characters, so Pat reloaded the save
[1:58:29] <Deadbulky> Ok lel
[1:58:32] <Mcgack2> you can knife the spiders
[1:58:32] <%MayorRev> OKAY
[1:58:34] <%Darren716> Oh it wasnt thaaat much
[1:58:36] <oyyzzo> SPEEDRUN
[1:58:39] <eldragon_1> Shut up, Tai from Digimon
[1:58:41] <TheMirai> this looks like the shittiest Silent Hill clone, holy shit
[1:58:46] <Jonny_Uppercut> Hey Pat why is Steve the fucking worst?

[1:59:02] <%Dementedpenguin> D2 eat your heart out. Kappa
[1:59:06] <MattDemers> Mind goblin: defeated
[1:59:14] <AutechreTwinAphex> @ranarath I'm not joking - look at the wiki entry for Code Veronica and you can read about it
[1:59:15] <%D3rrtyD4n> im enjoying myself
[1:59:17] <%Dementedpenguin> It's fine. The game just sucks.
[1:59:17] <%Jane_Lo> It's not really tho
[1:59:17] <%JJCheeker> It's OK
[1:59:19] <$joylent_blue> this shits great

[1:59:31] <%rickyjones47> Just a shit game Pat
[1:59:32] <natebud> No problem. This is the only RE game that punishes you for loading up before the 'final' boss.
[1:59:32] <%Dementedpenguin> You're still entertaining, Pat.
[1:59:32] <%MayorRev> SNIPED
[1:59:32] <TheMirai> I always wanted to know why this game sucks, now I know

[1:59:56] <+Mitchellsocks> Wait, why the hell are we back here?
[1:59:59] <%Darren716> @AngriestPat Reminder that Screwattack said this is the 4th best game on the dreamcast
[2:00:00] <AutechreTwinAphex> the real RE3 was originally called BIO1.9, and BIO3 was what turned into Devil May Cry, then they had to make a new RE4
[2:00:01] <FG_Leo106> its ok. you are doing god's work. you are showing how bad this game is and prevent more people to play it
[2:00:03] <%jillvxlentine> aw crap
[2:00:05] <%happyface699> It’s not your fault @angriestpat
[2:00:06] <%Tearonex> Nah, its still great Pat

[2:00:50] <oniwahoo> Claire is great
[2:00:53] <Maxknightosb> i've been playing thru all the RE's i never beat CVX was 1 of em
[2:00:57] <+officialprisonmike> you need to get a serum you don't if you don't get poisoned
[2:00:59] <AutechreTwinAphex> Kamiya also fucked up with BIO3, because the game had nothing to do anymore with RE they just had to make a new franchise Devil May Cry - they were pretty mad at him for that
[2:01:01] <rcand9> he is a man after all
[2:01:02] <%jillvxlentine> dont worry you get another sidepack

[2:04:11] <%Jaxnos> YOU CAN DO IT, KEVIN BACON
[2:04:11] <natebud> Optional Boss 1
[2:04:12] <AutechreTwinAphex> @ranarath Code Veronica is just an outsourced side project done as a favor from Capcom to Sega - that's why a Sega subsidiary even made it
[2:04:13] <%bigdumbidiotguy> what is that gunshot noise
[2:04:16] <%Ixiah> Dark souls boss :E
[2:04:16] <+Eiiriika> THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE'S SECRET TECHNIQUE?

[2:04:49] <%jillvxlentine> really?
[2:04:54] <AutechreTwinAphex> @ranarath google "The Development History of Resident Evil CODE: Veronica" and you can read it yourself - the game is a total outsource job and it was made by Sega devs, not Capcom
[2:04:55] <%scaryboisupreme> I think he's already over the time
[2:04:59] <%D3rrtyD4n> hmm
[2:05:06] <oyyzzo> the end credits?

[2:05:13] <EddieBrock> The graboid is about to doodBarf something up.

[2:07:52] <%Ixiah> So Pat started Blasting
[2:07:59] <natebud> sure, why not. Solve this ancient uzi puzzle.
[2:08:02] <%scaryboisupreme> actually saving Rodrigo is required to get an A rank

[2:10:33] <%Darren716> Is the knife supposed to be this good or are the multiple hits a fuck up?
[2:10:40] <Amasepyt> This part of the game is horrifyingly boring

[2:16:20] <djazo> THIS IS SO FUCKING DUMB
[2:16:21] <%rickyjones47> Its full of goo Pat
[2:16:22] <%StaceMcGate> You need HM Strength to move that barrel
[2:16:22] <%Sartastic> too heavy
[2:16:23] <thelonechris> Chris can punch a gigantic rock with his bare hands, but he can't move a barrel?
[2:16:25] <+Roundelay11> Chris "Boulder Punch" Redfield

[2:16:46] <$joylent_blue> uhhh
[2:16:46] <%takokasa> It was just a prank
[2:16:47] <zamzoph> it was all a Jebaited
[2:16:47] <%marsproject> Think it just destroyed the house.
[2:16:49] <$joylent_blue> FUCK LOL
[2:16:50] <oniwahoo> Leon and Chris! I can't type!

[2:16:57] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:16:58] <warmnoid> just a dream bro
[2:16:58] <%StaceMcGate> It was a modest self-destruct @AngriestPat
[2:16:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> bad Storytelling.
[2:17:01] <fugnuggets01> just a prank bro
[2:17:01] <rytisone> a self destruct that failed?
[2:17:02] <FaytLeingodz> its a studry crate man LUL
[2:17:03] <Deadbulky> Chris is weak, he cant move that barrel even tho he just solo climbed up a cliff with no equipment
[2:17:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> jabooty
[2:17:08] <RoyallyFlushed> Code Veronica is a bad game, yes
[2:17:16] <tearsaurther> Plus he can punch boulders
[2:17:17] <Shillk> the UI reminds me of PC-98 pixel art
[2:17:17] <Milo_Oda> that was the other secret island facility Kappa
[2:17:23] <flyingavocad0s> It’s the self destruct for the the mansion
[2:17:25] <oniwahoo> @gameover_here I believe he said he prefers Zero
[2:17:26] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat You see Steve thought is said self-destruct, but what it really said was security breach.
[2:17:29] <natebud> The self destruct caused some things fell off a shelf.
[2:17:29] <$RealThiele> just got it and never seen cvx, how far in are we as a %
[2:17:29] <EddieBrock> Realism... in my videogame!? Nonsense.
[2:17:31] <%nathandiel> Shit he’s right
[2:17:31] <+Grayhammatter> so, what you're saying is this is a bad game?
[2:17:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Chris can punch boulders but barrels.... that shit is too much
[2:17:32] <djazo> @angriestpat is there a reason why some people say this is the best one ?
[2:17:36] <pixelandarilho> so the game is saying that crhis is not able to MOVE A FUCKIN BARREL!!!! WutFace
[2:17:39] <burstaxe> this is the OTHER rockfort
[2:17:41] <+machshop> Game Informer ranked Code: Veronica as 69th in their "Top 100 Games of All Time" in 2001.

[2:19:50] <+jK00215> doodWesker doodWesker
[2:19:50] <AutechreTwinAphex> Wesker is really out of place here and adds nothing to thes tory
[2:19:52] <AutechreTwinAphex> story*
[2:19:54] <$RealThiele> wesker loves chris' boulder punching hands
[2:19:56] <%Typhaeon> C Douglas that is
[2:20:03] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Wesker fucks monkey frogs
[2:20:03] <oniwahoo> @oyyzzo Would that lead to him getting double super powers?
[2:20:07] <MSN04_Sazabi> C'mon guys, that can't be Wesker, he died in RE1, that's just his brother, or uncle or something
[2:20:10] <+StooEsq> Wesker likes blondes, though
[2:20:11] <nepwar> huh this track reminds me of KOTOR
[2:20:12] <%SirGO0SE> apatGib
[2:20:15] <AutechreTwinAphex> Wesker should have stayed dead in RE1
[2:20:15] <%scaryboisupreme> I think the best thing about these hunters is the weird purple and red ones are INSTANT poison
[2:20:17] <rcand9> let it play out
[2:20:24] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat would this playthrough be possible without a cat to pet?
[2:20:24] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Emotional support cat
[2:20:24] <AutechreTwinAphex> turning him into the major villain with superpowers was so stupid
[2:20:25] <MSN04_Sazabi> Rebecca isn't blonde
[2:20:27] <buffmurffy> it can't be wesker, it must be the original character, blester
[2:20:27] <tearsaurther> True cannon are the movies
[2:20:29] <+Eiiriika> there's no way zero is worse than this, it has the ZAPPING SYSTEM
[2:20:30] <%michingmallecho> Albert Wesker just wants a quiet life
[2:20:30] <+primax104> It can never not be Wesker

[2:21:22] <EddieBrock> Which RE had the best knife. GO.
[2:21:22] <%scaryboisupreme> Zero is fine until the giant bat
[2:21:24] <Dragovus> Why not just have him start with the side pack?
[2:21:24] <RoyallyFlushed> this is the game where Wesker shows off he has super powers and changes the concept of "bioweapon" in the series forever
[2:21:36] <warmnoid> omnicutting knife
[2:21:37] <Graxe_> That lightning sound that played when the eagle plate fell? That's the albinoid.
[2:21:39] <+parrotman01> @EddieBrock RE4
[2:21:47] <Milo_Oda> i love the rapid fire sound of the knife hits
[2:21:50] <djazo> man i have been thinking about dmc3 style switching all day
[2:21:50] <oniwahoo> I love the idea of this being a prog knife
[2:21:55] <%jillvxlentine> @Dragovus probably so you can make the game a little harder for yourself by not picking it up
[2:21:58] <Fujiwara_92> what, nah
[2:22:00] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[2:22:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 22m.
[2:22:07] <DuoScratch> So far it looks less like a self-destruct, and more like some jackass tossed some grenades here and there.
[2:22:08] <natebud> Prepare for the worst shotgun puzzle in any RE game.
[2:22:16] <Dragovus> @jillvxlentine fair enough
[2:22:25] <+TDotGoat> wait, was he walking down two steps at a time?
[2:22:28] <%StaceMcGate> apatBlep
[2:22:30] <%mistermastergreg> enbSwoleL apatElmo enbSwoleR
[2:22:41] <nepwar> more like an aftermath of a frat party
[2:22:42] <MSN04_Sazabi> You'd think Umbrella would catch on a lot quicker that making Captain Americas is gonna be a lot more appealing to their clients than barely controlled monsters that have to be cleaned up by a nuke
[2:22:45] <AutechreTwinAphex> and if you think the backtracking here is already bad, wait until chris gets back to antarctica
[2:22:57] <Fujiwara_92> damn
[2:23:05] <+arancet> clearly you havent pet fuggins enough
[2:23:08] <$RealThiele> pat has already let it be known that cat is best boi and he will sacrifice all other for him
[2:23:08] <Zekuu69> enbSwoleL enbMona enbSwoleR
[2:23:09] <%Ixiah> When will fuggings return to the stream ? :)
[2:23:21] <natebud> Everyone knows that if you shoot C4 it explodes LUL
[2:23:23] <biomegabear> I was worried that knife would be worse if chris used it
[2:23:26] <rcand9> free fuggins
[2:23:26] <%wsintai> When will Pat and Fuggins sex tape come out?
[2:23:29] <%dukenux> apatWink_SQ
[2:23:30] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> uwu
[2:23:31] <oyyzzo> people playtested this
[2:23:31] <bleugh> so the knife hits the enemies like 400 times in one swing?
[2:23:32] <AutechreTwinAphex> I have the feel that for this game they added A and B campaigns together to pad out the length
[2:23:42] <nepwar> pat has given fuggin's bag a good shake so his statement is not accurate
[2:23:44] <+Grayhammatter> stupid sexy skeleton
[2:23:44] <oniwahoo> Has Pet ever done a one dangerous zombie run?
[2:23:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I want Rebecca Chambers and Sheva to get a game together
[2:23:57] <MSN04_Sazabi> Fuggins was banished to the shadow run
[2:23:57] <%StaceMcGate> I can barely make out what is happening in these dark corridors
[2:24:01] <oniwahoo> Makes sense
[2:24:04] <MSN04_Sazabi> *shadow realm, lol
[2:24:06] <%JJCheeker> enbSwoleL doodWesker enbSwoleR
[2:24:14] <Manjove> i want Chambers in anything,
[2:24:19] <Fujiwara_92> one dangerous zombie?
[2:24:25] <+HouseofNonsense> Yo, what if RE8 is Sheva's game? Kreygasm
[2:24:26] <%mistermastergreg> enbSwoleL doodWesker enbSwoleR
[2:24:27] <rcand9> invisible one dangerous zombie runs now thats it
[2:24:31] <Shillk> not the fart gas
[2:24:37] <$RealThiele> wesker getting all sweaty being surrounded by big, beefy arms
[2:24:38] <djazo> @angriestpat do they tell you if the zombie explode or is it dumb
[2:24:38] <%passthehanky> if you have RE:REV2 on steam, do you have to buy the episodes individually or is it the full package? i've always been confused by it
[2:24:41] <fuchard1996> doesn't gas rise?
[2:24:46] <Graxe_> Zombie Forest follows you throughout the game, but he's strapped with bombs.
[2:24:47] <nepwar> @MSN04_Sazabi down to the shadow realm where he must play raid shadow legends TM forever
[2:24:50] <+Javaa01> Depends on the gas
[2:24:51] <%Jane_Lo> @HouseofNonsense if only capcom cared enough about her
[2:24:52] <natebud> I'll die from gas if I enter this room
[2:24:54] <ShichiNoBushi> I just got home, and Pat's apparently playing as Chris. I he already finished with Claire in Antarctica?
[2:24:54] <oyyzzo> heavy zombie gas
[2:24:56] <+arancet> re8 i imagine would be ethan or another new guy
[2:24:56] <ProfessorLitmus> FART GASSSSS
[2:24:56] <Graxe_> So if you shoot him, you die.
[2:24:58] <Milo_Oda> smoke rises
[2:25:02] <+MrLittleSam> Depends on the gas
[2:25:05] <%shiplord13> That is actually true
[2:25:05] <%DetroitSentai> depends
[2:25:05] <+Javaa01> Some gas is lighter then air, some gas is heavier then air
[2:25:08] <oniwahoo> @fujiwara_92 It's a bonus run in remake where you get chased by a zombie with explosives on it and if you shoot it you die
[2:25:08] <InvisibleMan101> the poison is too heavy
[2:25:09] <+Grayhammatter> gas, Gas, GAS
[2:25:10] <Fujiwara_92> this gas is more dense than air, so it doesn't rise
[2:25:10] <djazo> this is RE gas LUL
[2:25:15] <%Jane_Lo> @passthehanky you can do both, it has full option and one by one, since the first episode is cheaper
[2:25:15] <+HouseofNonsense> @Jane_Lo sigh, yeah...
[2:25:21] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[2:25:23] <%jillvxlentine> go to the other side of the water for some herbs and access to the save room
[2:25:25] <Graxe_> If you want the stairs down, you need to put the shotgun back there.
[2:25:26] <Milo_Oda> do you rike, mai CA-r
[2:25:28] <MSN04_Sazabi> Hey guys, remember when companies thought episodic games are gonna be the hottest shit ever? Fun times LUL
[2:25:31] <%passthehanky> @Jane_Lo rad thank you, i think i got the full one
[2:25:32] <Graxe_> Which means the shotgun was gone
[2:25:32] <%SilverFaustX> apatWhat
[2:25:35] <Fujiwara_92> @oniwahoo oh cool
[2:25:37] <+G_Thunders> I wouldn’t mind if new RE games put the story back in the late 90’s/early 00’s and kept the core characters
[2:25:38] <FG_Leo106> this part is tricky yup
[2:25:41] <rcand9> most wanted protag for re8?
[2:25:43] <SocialMisfitGamer> YES
[2:25:45] <%jillvxlentine> maybe it fell down because of the blast?
[2:25:47] <nademonkey1100> is that a fucing spas 12
[2:25:49] <+NormenKD> Is this Patrick "AngriestPat" Boivin of YoutubeHaiku fame? moon2CUTE moon2CUTE
[2:25:50] <%ranarath> Gotta protect the shotgun.
[2:25:54] <$RealThiele> they didnt want jeff to get it cause hes an asshole
[2:25:56] <natebud> maybe that's what that guy called wesker about earlier
[2:25:58] <%bluebiscuit94> It's always a Spas-12
[2:25:59] <SocialMisfitGamer> dont worry about it
[2:26:02] <%theKingRamses> the graboid left it there on it's smoke break
[2:26:06] <%Kegeto> pat dont think about too much it magic
[2:26:07] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat maybe they did that so they could get to the escape plane?
[2:26:13] <djazo> this game is dumb that.s why LUL
[2:26:15] <pixelandarilho> because game writers
[2:26:16] <+DiabloDeAzul> RE8 better involve hunk
[2:26:20] <Maxknightosb> you cant get the shotgun till almost the end of this part
[2:26:22] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat It was Rodrigo. Everything being weird and different was Rodrigo.
[2:26:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It was Terminator
[2:26:29] <%logoth_> RE7 Remake!
[2:26:31] <%SilverFaustX> Cause anime

[2:29:08] <+albedo455> hunters are assholes
[2:29:09] <natebud> The Albanoid will turn everyone around on this game. I just know it.
[2:29:10] <phatballlz54> i love it. no joke i actually fucking love this game!
[2:29:10] <+Grayhammatter> i can't believe pat got killed by battletoads
[2:29:11] <FG_Leo106> Speaking of Hunters. do you guys like how they look in RE3 remake? they are huge, have big claws and even a tail
[2:29:12] <djazo> i like actually lime that ost a lot
[2:29:12] <%rickyjones47> Skip this game. fuck it. it doesnt deserve to be completed
[2:29:14] <%CollinsOfBodom> Don't give up skeleton
[2:29:15] <+Eddy21forsaken> anything other than this game time
[2:29:16] <+whackashack> Yeah, Chris's part made me quit, since I had no weapons or health items.

[2:29:29] <%Hilleltaco> remember spider tho
[2:29:32] <rcand9> AAAAH SPIDER AGAIN
[2:29:32] <%scaryboisupreme> i missed it did pat die

[2:29:35] <%DetroitSentai> oh shit its a spider again
[2:29:36] <+G_Thunders> I just ran away from the hunters and they weren’t there when I came back
[2:29:40] <natebud> Local pushover dies in one push
[2:29:40] <%JJCheeker> spiders don't even look scary
[2:29:42] <RoyallyFlushed> leaping jumps are a lot of animation effort
[2:29:54] <rcand9> spiders look awful
[2:29:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Some of yall have bad jokes
[2:29:55] <Manjove> there was no time
[2:29:55] <oniwahoo> Man, that spider just whooo, I almost had a heart attack there
[2:30:07] <Shillk> funny fish man slapped him and he died @scaryboisupreme
[2:30:14] <ohgodscorpions> it decafinates you
[2:30:24] <nepwar> that says a lot about society
[2:30:25] <$RealThiele> capcom need money, cut developer
[2:30:26] <EddieBrock> RE3 is better.
[2:30:26] <%JJCheeker> This game is a bad joke
[2:30:28] <CassyASG> there is two different in this too
[2:30:30] <rcand9> almost like re3 is a better game and was mainline
[2:30:32] <natebud> Oh just wait until you see the second model for CVX Hunters LUL
[2:30:34] <%Taisuru> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhand_HF
[2:30:35] <%scaryboisupreme> Enhanced sweepers are red and green

[2:30:38] <%scaryboisupreme> and glowy
[2:30:40] <%chiluzza> fuck when was the last time you sdaved
[2:30:41] <Milo_Oda> is the game dark to hide how shit models actual are
[2:30:42] <%scaryboisupreme> but they still suck
[2:31:03] <oniwahoo> Aren't the frogs in this game as well?
[2:31:04] <djazo> @tracazoid darkside skips a lot of stuff still bad but better then running all over the place in this game
[2:31:06] <+toadlyy> LUL
[2:31:07] <%Kegeto> lol
[2:31:08] <%Nina96> Is this what DMC2 would have been just u and woolie becoming miserable and mad @AngriestPat
[2:31:10] <Huntercd> Did Mikami direct this?
[2:31:13] <%CollinsOfBodom> it ain't no FF6 opera, that's for sure
[2:31:16] <%rickyjones47> imagine if they remade this next. what a waste of time and money that would be
[2:31:17] <%spoonbruh> I don’t remember that bit in the cut scene
[2:31:21] <natebud> At least DMC2 is short
[2:31:26] <%JJCheeker> There are frogs in the game but they end up turning gay
[2:31:31] <FG_Leo106> Pat, after you get the Shotgun you unlock a path that connects you with the Spider Save room iirc
[2:31:39] <%Nina96> yup
[2:31:40] <rcand9> cowards dont skip dmc2
[2:31:50] <nepwar> naw DMC2 would just be crowbcat's video
[2:31:51] <oniwahoo> Claire did it way easier
[2:31:54] <%SilverFaustX> HotPokket
[2:31:56] <djazo> @huntercd i don.t think he had anything to do with this
[2:31:59] <%spoonbruh> That’s because he’s silly and still uses his resi one knife duhbhhh
[2:32:00] <%rickyjones47> is chris slower with the knife?
[2:32:01] <Deadbulky> That zombo really want chris
[2:32:07] <phatballlz54> turbo zombie
[2:32:11] <oyyzzo> reset
[2:32:16] <JxsFusion> is chris taller?
[2:32:18] <+pectusumbra> maybe it's because he's a little taller?
[2:32:18] <natebud> Is Chris taller effecting the hitbox?
[2:32:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Everyone runs faster with a knife
[2:32:41] <%spoonbruh> @natebud actually that could be a thing
[2:32:43] <oniwahoo> Remake is awesome
[2:32:44] <%jillvxlentine> are you gonna play as jill or chris?
[2:32:45] <%Ixiah> remake or remake remake ?
[2:32:46] <%terminallyCapriciousz> according to this game, Chris is 5'9"
[2:32:47] <%Darren716> Fuck you thats why
[2:32:50] <rytisone> You gonna play Remake as Chris this time?
[2:32:58] <EddieBrock> Capcom really thought the bowgun was that good that they brought it back twice...
[2:33:01] <%jillvxlentine> yay!
[2:33:03] <ProfessorLitmus> wait shouldn't you play Zero before remake?
[2:33:03] <%ChaosAethr> yey bowgun ammo
[2:33:04] <%SilverFaustX> I just played re1 jill
[2:33:07] <%passthehanky> jill is just better to play as anyway
[2:33:08] <%spoonbruh> Yesssssss
[2:33:09] <rcand9> 5'9 is massive Kappa
[2:33:10] <oniwahoo> @garbagenirvana Everyone knows that

[2:33:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Chris's campaign also Sucks
[2:33:32] <%Nina96> prob
[2:33:35] <%Tomfom25> is it true that the zombies are less interested in killing Jill
[2:33:36] <%sporeian94> It upsets me that even this piece of poop game gets digital releases on modern consoles, yet Silent Hill 2 and 3 are literally unavailable on modern consoles
[2:33:36] <natebud> Just a reminder that this is 3 months after RE2.
[2:33:38] <%passthehanky> short hair AND a hat dude

[2:33:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Barry adds alot more to the narrative than REbecca does
[2:33:46] <nepwar> but when did the tiny aspect come into play?
[2:33:48] <phatballlz54> but REmake 3 is Nemmy time from the looks of it
[2:33:48] <%dukenux> you mean "fetish"
[2:33:51] <Red_Zelaroth> to be fair, berets on women are 🔥

[2:33:58] <Huntercd> Jill has jiggle physics
[2:34:00] <oniwahoo> It's weird, I don't think I've ever actually considered a beret a hat for some reason
[2:34:02] <%scaryboisupreme> Shame her hat dies in RE3
[2:34:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> At this point. Is Evil truly in a Residence?

[2:34:20] <EddieBrock> Her STARS uniform better be an option in Remake 3..
[2:34:24] <+primax104> the evil was in our hearts all along
[2:34:24] <phatballlz54> imagine Jill with Jotaro's hat
[2:34:26] <%sporeian94> Is resident in the sense of it's with the residency of the characters in their physical locations
[2:34:30] <+HouseofNonsense> I kinda wish Jill wore hats more often. She has one in RE5, but eh.
[2:34:30] <%king_strongstyle> 3rd strike announcer voice yea that makes sense
[2:34:31] <Fujiwara_92> vanilla fetishes LUL
[2:34:38] <%Kegeto> are you going to skiping reverlations 1
[2:34:39] <lotharrio> reRE1?
[2:34:41] <%scaryboisupreme> Man I hope you get all the extra costumes in RE3
[2:34:41] <ohgodscorpions> chicks with hats is good but chicks with dicks now THATS a kink
[2:34:42] <%dukenux> That actually explains tubetops for me, since i played RE3 first
[2:34:42] <rytisone> League
[2:34:47] <+primax104> will pat play digimon?
[2:34:51] <%happyface699> @turtlesandtentacles Re 7 was the baker residence
[2:34:52] <Fujiwara_92> the bad CVX taste
[2:34:52] <%meltdown547> More NMS.
[2:34:57] <darthriven501> !uptime
[2:34:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 34m.
[2:35:00] <rytisone> or Kakarot
[2:35:00] <rcand9> re 1 jill will be in guys if not an unlock dlc
[2:35:02] <Fujiwara_92> play dbz kakarot
[2:35:03] <+primax104> or TMS?
[2:35:03] <Dragovus> Gotta complete that FF7 too
[2:35:04] <%Tomfom25> is it true that the zombies are less interested in killing Jill
[2:35:05] <+StooEsq> gotta cleanse the palate following CVX
[2:35:14] <%Aydarkzero> eh
[2:35:14] <Terrabyte_The_Terrible> eh
[2:35:14] <%DetroitSentai> no
[2:35:15] <%NovaKnightmare> eh
[2:35:15] <Meekest> Hell no LUL
[2:35:15] <%Nina96> meh
[2:35:18] <rcand9> eh i heard mixed
[2:35:19] <@commanderclaw> I hear it makes Gohan better
[2:35:19] <EddieBrock> People on Steam think it's good. So no.
[2:35:20] <%SilverFaustX> Yes
[2:35:20] <biomegabear> It feels bettere than XENOVERSEW
[2:35:21] <+RenoDeGeneric> Doesnt really look good but seems fun
[2:35:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @happyface699 It was Truly an Evil Residence
[2:35:26] <+TheStarvingGood> I like it
[2:35:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I heard it is
[2:35:27] <+PanicSwytch> Not worth $60
[2:35:28] <%ChaosAethr> eh
[2:35:28] <Deadbulky> It seems to be good not great but good
[2:35:29] <BurdRightsActivist> More like DBZ Krako-shit am I right? 4hEAD
[2:35:30] <%happyface699> @turtlesandtentacles Truly
[2:35:31] <%Darren716> I hear it's a solid 6.5
[2:35:31] <+HouseofNonsense> All I've heard about is that there's a lot of tutorials
[2:35:33] <%bread_assassin> It looks repetitive.
[2:35:33] <%michingmallecho> eh
[2:35:35] <munchkay> What other two new features do you think DMC3 will have?
[2:35:36] <%Rngiddion> its mid
[2:35:38] <nepwar> eh its something for people that wanted dbz but not a fighting game
[2:35:40] <%Nina96> wait for a sale tbh
[2:35:40] <biomegabear> ITS FINE BUT NOT AMAZING
[2:35:41] <SocialMisfitGamer> I mean, do you want to go through all the sagas again? @AngriestPat
[2:35:43] <%michingmallecho> So-so
[2:35:44] <%DetroitSentai> It's mediocre, not trash enough for a laugh but the cutscenes are cool looking but infrequent
[2:35:46] <%Tearonex> it's 'meh'
[2:35:47] <Fujiwara_92> it's a 6.8 I'd say
[2:35:48] <+PanicSwytch> Alot of fetch quests
[2:35:48] <%ChaosAethr> How about more No Man sky?
[2:35:49] <%dukenux> more like Crap-a-lot amirite?
[2:35:51] <%SilverFaustX> Its exactly like the tv show
[2:35:54] <$MildConviction> why ask a bunch of bunch who likely haven't put more than 30 minutes into it?
[2:35:56] <biomegabear> THE FLYING IS GOOD THOUGH
[2:36:00] <$MildConviction> bunch of people*
[2:36:04] <%dukenux> (didnt play it btw, only a joke)

[2:36:38] <%wsintai> @BurdRightsActivist Dragon Ball shit is cool though
[2:36:38] <%CollinsOfBodom> @angriestpat I watched a stream of Kakarot last night, it has a super slow beginning to it but the fighting aspect looks really good

[2:37:23] <devanmuse> hang on: this game started because claire was trying to track down her brother (Chris) right? but she's in contact with leon, who can just send Chris info at any time? why didn't she just get leon to tell her where he was?
[2:37:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> nothing to do with chat lol
[2:37:29] <rcand9> will max stream a non fighting game dbz you think? prob not huh?
[2:37:49] <%trekkie11041> @AngriestPat theres a shortcut in the shotgun room
[2:37:50] <Graxe_> Max has no interest in DBZ if it's not a fighting game
[2:37:51] <%happyface699> @turtlesandtentacles How bout resident evil in a similar structure as silent hill 2? Streets and apartments and such
[2:37:53] <%Aydarkzero> ye
[2:37:54] <+albedo455> Max LUL
[2:38:02] <EddieBrock> Max would never stream it.
[2:38:05] <%Binary_Fireball> is Pat gonna play kakarot??
[2:38:09] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @devanmuse so the game can happen
[2:38:09] <oniwahoo> Pat is having a blast
[2:38:12] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> A bullet saved is a bullet earned
[2:38:13] <%jillvxlentine> yeah behind where the stairs were
[2:38:13] <Graxe_> He's said so because people ask him
[2:38:14] <%happyface699> Just make resident evil like early silent hill
[2:38:22] <%Binary_Fireball> yaaay
[2:38:24] <natebud> So glad I emulated this first time through. Shameless savestating

[2:39:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @happyface699 That would add to the absurdity that people couldnt tell shit was going wrong. I love it. I hear most of the Silent Hill guys worked on RE7 so here's hoping for some overlap
[2:39:09] <oyyzzo> mrow
[2:39:16] <%happyface699> fuck it just rip off early silent hill I dont care

[2:48:46] <%Hilleltaco> I hate it when Hunters flndhn
[2:48:47] <%JJCheeker> You would think they had guns or something on them instead of calling in hunters
[2:48:48] <%jillvxlentine> a hunters like "surprise bitch"
[2:48:52] <Deadbulky> Hunter everywhere system
[2:48:54] <+jackraiden23> @AngriestPat hey pat what happened to league of legends, are you not playing it anymore

[2:49:15] <natebud> A monster closet right next to the save room
[2:49:16] <SleepyMaribo> wtf is that knife?
[2:49:23] <Deadbulky> How hard would be the game if the knife wasnt bugged?
[2:49:24] <+worthwhile_off> knife op
[2:49:27] <+worthwhile_off> pls ban
[2:49:33] <person181> magic knife
[2:49:33] <Daxalog> Fully Automatic Knife
[2:49:34] <$RealThiele> knife is like automated rotary hammer
[2:49:35] <Fujiwara_92> auto knoife PogChamp
[2:49:38] <Huntercd> high frequency knife
[2:49:38] <%ChaosAethr> Ban Knife
[2:49:39] <+Shacklebox> it's a bad game with a really good knife
[2:49:41] <Daxalog> Auualt Knifal
[2:49:42] <+G_Thunders> @deadbulky not hard at all because there’s tons of ammo
[2:49:46] <%dylanhack> We're gonna be needing Joe Baker for this shit
[2:49:49] <%jepupu> *slash* *slslslslslslslslslslash* *slash*
[2:49:50] <rcand9> knife is the best part of the game
[2:49:52] <%terminallyCapriciousz> uwu coding
[2:49:56] <Alluringcrest> Is it as good as that RE2 knife tho
[2:49:56] <natebud> Weapons are OSP chris
[2:50:02] <EddieBrock> Everyone knows a knife is bad for kneecaps.
[2:50:03] <oniwahoo> Better question is why can't all RE knives be so amazing
[2:50:04] <Shillk> man wesker, these are some really shitty motion sensors
[2:50:08] <+jackraiden23> im confused, so no more league streams? or did you answer this already
[2:50:09] <%Nina96> thats sad
[2:50:10] <%CollinsOfBodom> I realized today in REmake2 they even change the model for the knife
[2:50:13] <djazo> it buts the RE4 knife to shame LUL
[2:50:14] <nepwar> bring knife to smash
[2:50:22] <+BrooklynAIA> i like the safe room music in this game
[2:50:23] <djazo> puts
[2:50:27] <%passthehanky> aren't there a couple different models for knives in RE2R?
[2:50:29] <$RealThiele> jill final smash knife spam
[2:50:29] <Daxalog> he uninstalled league no space
[2:50:34] <SleepyMaribo> if you tell me the knife can down bosses im gonna cry
[2:50:36] <%JJCheeker> The pacing in this game is the worst
[2:50:37] <ohgodscorpions> claire slashes her way into battle
[2:50:40] <fuchard1996> man jill could've been in smash
[2:50:41] <%spoonbruh> This Chris is so blocky but I still prefer him to the shit show that was 7
[2:50:43] <%CollinsOfBodom> like if you use the original costumes I guess
[2:50:44] <%StaceMcGate> this whole Chris part of the game feels like padding
[2:50:45] <rcand9> close second is matrix wesker
[2:50:46] <+Shacklebox> you should
[2:50:49] <+Xooler67> Xooler67 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:50:55] <GameOver_Here> Prefer this or Zero?
[2:50:56] <%passthehanky> that's because it is
[2:50:57] <%Nina96> it is
[2:51:03] <phatballlz54> you can put down two bandersnatches with knife and only be in caution
[2:51:04] <%wsintai> More like PATTING amirite?
[2:51:06] <+Estuko> PogChamp plus I also had acrush on a girl named Veronica in school. I recall the crush being better than the game. lol
[2:51:12] <%passthehanky> and billy
[2:51:13] <+jackraiden23> How come chris gets so much ammo, yet he basically has like 20 enemies to fight in his entire section
[2:51:14] <Shillk> two mansions? is this luigi's mansion 2?
[2:51:15] <$RealThiele> padding like chris' big beefy muscles
[2:51:15] <%NovaKnightmare> and Billy
[2:51:15] <%passthehanky> don't forget billy
[2:51:16] <%Basch71> 0 is more interesting
[2:51:16] <natebud> 0 has far less bullshit
[2:51:19] <Daxalog> 2nd....mansion?
[2:51:20] <+primax104> also Rebecca
[2:51:21] <%Vikken141> O has great art
[2:51:21] <%passthehanky> and rebecca
[2:51:23] <%JJCheeker> This game makes zero look like a masterpiece
[2:51:24] <rytisone> Pat loves eliminators CONFIRMED
[2:51:30] <%passthehanky> 0's not terrible it's just weird
[2:51:31] <%Nina96> @AngriestPat so is this the worst RE game or just up there?
[2:51:32] <Graxe_> The best parts of Code Veronica is Claire's island section in the beginning and Chris's Antarctica section at the end
[2:51:33] <+worthwhile_off> RE 0 needs a balance patch
[2:51:33] <EddieBrock> Capcom doesn't remember Billy.
[2:51:40] <+RenoDeGeneric> Pat did you see League's new punch boy?
[2:51:41] <%passthehanky> capcom should remember billy
[2:51:45] <Huntercd> Rebecca in Wesker mode tho
[2:51:52] <rcand9> zero has leech zombos and they scare the shit out of me
[2:51:52] <phatballlz54> 0 was way more frustrating to me i'm weird idk
[2:51:53] <%passthehanky> dead aim and gaiden
[2:51:53] <xanderfist> at least in 0 you can see what's happening
[2:51:58] <%StaceMcGate> gun survivor
[2:52:01] <+jackraiden23> whats your least favorite mainline game pat, mine is RE0 for sure
[2:52:03] <%ChaosAethr> Umberlla Corps is the worst
[2:52:04] <gusdabus91> survivor?
[2:52:04] <fuchard1996> re2 gamecom
[2:52:05] <%linkster291> What about the ORC.
[2:52:06] <%marsproject> Outbreak?
[2:52:09] <%spoonbruh> Dead aim
[2:52:09] <+moink1234> raccoon city
[2:52:09] <%passthehanky> gun survivor is nowhere near as bad as gaiden
[2:52:11] <bleugh> guy-den
[2:52:12] <$RealThiele> RE:0 for me is one foot over the animu line from zombie survival to dafaq
[2:52:15] <Deadbulky> FK i forgot about gainden
[2:52:16] <EddieBrock> ORC is worse than this by far.
[2:52:17] <djazo> gun survivor
[2:52:22] <cyberblueneon> gun survivor is apparently considered good in japan
[2:52:22] <%passthehanky> ORC and UC are actual trash
[2:52:24] <%spoonbruh> Outbreak is awesome, dead aim is awfullllll
[2:52:30] <%passthehanky> gun survivor has a cool speedrun
[2:52:35] <%Xooler67> gun survivor not trash?
[2:52:36] <%spoonbruh> Oh god I forgot about ORC
[2:52:37] <%StaceMcGate> Alfred's spirit lives on
[2:52:39] <Graxe_> But what Alexia
[2:52:41] <+whackashack> I forgot that those even existed.
[2:52:42] <%FalseEyeD> @AngriestPat Legit, I love this extra effort for performance
[2:52:42] <FG_Leo106> 0 has annoying shit like the lack of item boxes, billy cant mix herbs or the fact that weapons like a Shotgun takes 2 slots of the inventory
[2:52:42] <bleugh> unwashed LUL
[2:52:43] <Graxe_> She's in Antarctica
[2:52:52] <$RealThiele> aaaaayyyyuuuuuuuusssssssssss
[2:52:53] <Graxe_> She's not even on Rockfort

[2:53:09] <3Xgilly> Does Operation Raccoon City count?
[2:53:10] <djazo> we need a outbreak on ps4 capcom doodStare
[2:53:11] <SleepyMaribo> Ddamn has this bitch ever heard of NDA's?
[2:53:14] <$RealThiele> simpsons butler
[2:53:14] <%godzookylives> EEEHHHEEEEEEE
[2:53:14] <natebud> Fuck off, the mansion is the only thing in the skyline
[2:53:21] <3Xgilly> as one of the wierd classes
[2:53:22] <SleepyMaribo> you gotta kill the construction crew, the fuck?
[2:53:27] <+Dingalow> Hello Pat
[2:53:27] <3Xgilly> of RE
[2:53:29] <%spoonbruh> Ok trump 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
[2:53:33] <Vitoria90> hellos
[2:53:35] <%FalseEyeD> Is this... Chris' Blood?
[2:53:37] <Deadbulky> Oh boi
[2:53:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ah, like a pharaoh.
[2:53:42] <+worthwhile_off> Drunk Umbrella Corps. with friends online is a good time, anytime.
[2:53:43] <Vitoria90> I finally beat REmake 2 a few days ago, hooray
[2:53:44] <jorniev> oooooooooo kaaaaaaaayyyyyyy
[2:53:45] <+jackraiden23> pat, least favorite mainline RE?
[2:53:46] <Wan6Saber> ResidentSleeper
[2:53:50] <rcand9> woolie is gonna be a screamlord again
[2:54:00] <biomegabear> Umbrela corp Code: Veronica
[2:54:00] <%ChaosAethr> Umbrella Corps Wins Worst because it can be unplayable at times
[2:54:03] <%Aydarkzero> @rcand9 you mean he wasn't already?
[2:54:04] <%Kegeto> so navy army and air force again?
[2:54:06] <%spoonbruh> Worst canon game?
[2:54:08] <%FalseEyeD> You're doing great, slugger
[2:54:10] <jorniev> oh shit he is chris now?
[2:54:11] <Deadbulky> Cant wait for the hot mess that is RE6 stream
[2:54:13] <Vitoria90> Umbrella Corpse isn't mainline tho
[2:54:16] <%passthehanky> so many things are canon
[2:54:20] <EddieBrock> Worst canon is RE6.
[2:54:22] <%passthehanky> it's hard to even keep track
[2:54:25] <jorniev> man i really dont remember shit in this game
[2:54:29] <oniwahoo> It's almost like Alfred wrote that with the intention of someone else reading it
[2:54:35] <%FalseEyeD> Nearly everything in RE is Canon, right?
[2:54:37] <rcand9> @Aydarkzero a professional one this time
[2:54:39] <natebud> Neo Umbrella though
[2:54:43] <Vitoria90> yeah but RE6 drags on until you want to give up
[2:54:44] <Tucker0603> Jake is cool
[2:54:45] <theaterunderground> re 6 is fine
[2:54:51] <%Aydarkzero> @rcand9 monkaS
[2:54:54] <rytisone> Teragrigia
[2:54:55] <Deadbulky> i like re6 gameplay but bleeeeeeeh
[2:54:57] <Vitoria90> while Zero and CVX are atleast short
[2:54:59] <Graxe_> The idea of what the C-Virus is and can do is kinda cool
[2:54:59] <oyyzzo> TPFufun
[2:55:00] <%spoonbruh> I like 6
[2:55:01] <+jackraiden23> @AngriestPat Pat don't say that, i beat it a week ago, its even worse than i remember
[2:55:01] <Vitoria90> like normal RE games
[2:55:04] <Daxalog> RE6 Aka Giraffe getting a blowjob
[2:55:06] <%Shadowpint> Either CVX or RE6 is the worst canon by far
[2:55:07] <%Aydarkzero> when did that camera patch happen?
[2:55:11] <Graxe_> Since it's a hybrid of G and T-Veronica
[2:55:12] <natebud> CVX is not short enough
[2:55:13] <Amasepyt> i wish RE6 wasn't 50 hours long
[2:55:14] <%happyface699> Grown up sherry is cool
[2:55:15] <jorniev> wooooow
[2:55:16] <tearsaurther> best cannon is the Live Action Movies
[2:55:16] <%JJCheeker> The game is awful to play split screen Co op
[2:55:16] <%FalseEyeD> Looking forward to your stream, big time
[2:55:18] <+PalmtopNami> MASH ON THE BUTTON AND WIGGLE THE STICK
[2:55:22] <Graxe_> So you got fire blood, rapid mutation, and bug stuff
[2:55:24] <GameOver_Here> I played it last year and still couldn't stand it
[2:55:25] <3Xgilly> oh geez thats late asf
[2:55:30] <%Aydarkzero> don't worry about it
[2:55:32] <Shillk> did you see the RE5 but with no color filter?
[2:55:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> Oh shit there was a camera patch? I played it like 2 years after it came out.
[2:55:33] <EddieBrock> The camera patch took Chris's massive arm out of our faces.
[2:55:36] <MassConnect> you played RE6 more than once?
[2:55:37] <KeiPrime> wiat he gonna do every scenario in re6? that'll tkae like a month
[2:55:38] <theaterunderground> jake is cool, sherry is cool, helena is cool
[2:55:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I like RE6. Not Jake snow board part
[2:55:41] <rcand9> thats cool still not touching it again
[2:55:42] <assman1234> I find no redeeming quality in RE6. Fuck that game
[2:55:44] <%trekkie11041> pat the stairs are down
[2:55:46] <+Dingalow> I checked out of RE6 after playing the demo and seeing that cutscene of Chris getting drunk at a bar, then all the bar patrons stood up to grant him support
[2:55:49] <Vitoria90> God Chris' run animation in this game looks worse than in RE1 og
[2:55:49] <+fillmydarksoulwithlight> the dumb part about re6 was the ada romannce shit with the villian
[2:55:51] <Vitoria90> he's so stiff
[2:55:56] <natebud> Shotgun puzzle LUL
[2:55:58] <%passthehanky> honestly this is the worst canon game
[2:55:59] <%Shadowpint> woops CVX or RE0 I meant
[2:56:00] <%FalseEyeD> LUL
[2:56:01] <%ChaosAethr> That was the Time when RE was just imitating Dead Space and got it wrong
[2:56:01] <%Aydarkzero> i think the problem is b/c i finished re6 so fast i never experienced the camera patch
[2:56:04] <%spoonbruh> Worst for me was 5, EXCEPT when playing co op
[2:56:08] <$RealThiele> someone get the shaker we mining slat
[2:56:08] <tearsaurther> @angriestpat Resident Evil needed Mila Jovovich
[2:56:11] <%JJCheeker> You're almost up the Hill
[2:56:11] <+storkeylope> Favorite thing about RE6 is Sherry’s G stuff
[2:56:17] <%FalseEyeD> 5 is night and day with Co-Op
[2:56:18] <fuchard1996> you can stop any time you want to pat
[2:56:19] <KeiPrime> BOLD STATEMENT
[2:56:20] <+Estuko> I remember when I played RE6, my friend and I got mega super hype when we manned the giant drilling machine Vs that tyrant thing monster
[2:56:20] <$Jmann1892> hashD
[2:56:22] <EddieBrock> Nice.
[2:56:23] <biomegabear> YOU SAY THAT BUT WAIT TILL YOU PLAY RE 6
[2:56:25] <Vitoria90> that's rough
[2:56:26] <%Nina96> yup
[2:56:26] <oyyzzo> hater's paradise today
[2:56:26] <%Aydarkzero> i love Simmons Boss Fight theme
[2:56:26] <+Dingalow> Ouch
[2:56:27] <Deadbulky> PogChamp
[2:56:27] <rcand9> 5 is wayyyyy beter than 6
[2:56:28] <+razielhex> Wait, how long occurs between this game and RE5? How many steroids was Chris Redfield taking in that duration?
[2:56:28] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> Same
[2:56:29] <+jackraiden23> pat you remember wrong i swear, when you play re6 you will remember how horrible it is
[2:56:30] <jorniev> and then dead space started imitating RE 6
[2:56:30] <natebud> Trying to solve the shotgun puzzle just makes it worse.
[2:56:30] <Meekest> Just wait
[2:56:31] <theaterunderground> yea
[2:56:31] <+professormorrigan> jesus LUL
[2:56:31] <KwameWithThePowerOfEarth> oof
[2:56:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> daaaamn
[2:56:31] <Vitoria90> I really hope we get CVX Remake
[2:56:32] <$RealThiele> all we need is BOULDER PUNCH
[2:56:32] <%vaporousTippler> RE 6 at least has fun moments.
[2:56:32] <FennecZephyr> Yea this game looks like the big poopy
[2:56:33] <%DakotaMacDoodle> fair
[2:56:34] <rytisone> that's not what you said in the beginning
[2:56:35] <Vitoria90> it needs it really bad
[2:56:35] <%D3rrtyD4n> yup
[2:56:35] <%takiyami> It's official
[2:56:35] <+G_Thunders> I played RE6 for the first time a year ago, and I couldn’t believe how tedious it was
[2:56:36] <%passthehanky> 5 is a fuckin blast
[2:56:36] <+RenoDeGeneric> RE6 is fun gameplay wise.
[2:56:37] <%Zebroneath> There you have it, folks
[2:56:37] <DracaenaLeaf> Re6 is a fine shooter just a shitty horror game
[2:56:39] <+Javaa01> RE6 is fucking stupid, but at least it's a laugh
[2:56:40] <+worthwhile_off> I want Leon and Ada to have kids that become B.O.W. fighter agents.
[2:56:40] <%jillvxlentine> yeah cause at least re6 isn't boring
[2:56:43] <natebud> Wise choice
[2:56:45] <+HouseofNonsense> RE6 has Mercenaries, if nothing else.
[2:56:46] <+PalmtopNami> atleast it has some cool mechanics and is dumb fun.
[2:56:48] <+arancet> i played re6 after the patch and never thought it was awful, but the tone and pacing is all over the place and it DRAGS bad
[2:56:48] <%JJCheeker> I'm excited to watch you play RE 6 because I never played it
[2:56:49] <%spoonbruh> What about 5?
[2:56:50] <%Sartastic> RE6 has sick matrix moves
[2:56:54] <$MildConviction> ANGRYIEST PAT SHOOTS HARD ON CVX
[2:56:55] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> sugoiSmugsnake
[2:56:56] <jorniev> man dead space got it so fucking bad
[2:56:58] <biomegabear> This is more RE than 6 though in terms of tone
[2:56:59] <%happyface699> At least re 6 is dumb fun
[2:56:59] <EddieBrock> @AngriestPat Why is RE5 the best on PS4?
[2:57:00] <%passthehanky> 5 isn't even in the conversation for "bad RE" to me
[2:57:00] <Deadbulky> 5 is dumb but fun dumb
[2:57:00] <Renuarb> RE6's Mercanary Mode can't be disupted though. It's a lot of fun
[2:57:00] <%OldOnyx> There's a single good campaign worth of content in 6... spread across 4 and a half campaigns
[2:57:01] <jorniev> fuck ea
[2:57:02] <+BonusSkeleton> RE6 gets a lot of shit but its honestly a fun game just a shit resident evel itlte
[2:57:02] <KeiPrime> 6 mercs is better than cvx battle mode yes, but damn
[2:57:06] <cureneckbeard> but pat, if you don't finish this game, nobody will
[2:57:07] <%Garthunox> RE6 has dumb moments, but it's that kinda dumb that's so dumb you laugh
[2:57:08] <murilo182x> If you look at RE6 like a fun action game to screw around with friends, it's actually not that bad
[2:57:11] <djazo> if RE6 wasn.t 100 hours i would have liked a lot
[2:57:12] <+Jumpie8> LUL
[2:57:15] <%passthehanky> the PC version is super fucked up but it works
[2:57:17] <%Shadowpint> I didn't think Dead Space 3 was that bad
[2:57:17] <KwameWithThePowerOfEarth> saves getting deleted n stuff
[2:57:22] <%passthehanky> co-op works and that's all that matters
[2:57:22] <Vitoria90> PC version died of Games For Windows Live
[2:57:22] <%Garthunox> like that tiger thing
[2:57:25] <+Dingalow> Now hang on. You're gonna play 6 and remember just how bad it is
[2:57:25] <djazo> it
[2:57:26] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you shoot the ceiling sensor bot things? Also, if a hunter triggers, does it then persist?
[2:57:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you know, Doiyin' ain't so bad
[2:57:29] <rcand9> i love 5 its a bad re but fun as shit
[2:57:33] <%spoonbruh> Didn’t it all kick off about 5 because of “racism”?
[2:57:33] <%passthehanky> @Vitoria90 it actually works on steam now
[2:57:36] <natebud> RE6 would have been a lot better without the reused sections.
[2:57:36] <%scaryboisupreme> imma head out, dinner must be consumed
[2:57:38] <Vitoria90> nice
[2:57:38] <$Jmann1892> If RE^ gave you more ammo I would like it more
[2:57:40] <+Javaa01> Yes it does
[2:57:43] <$Jmann1892> *RE6
[2:57:43] <%passthehanky> i played co-op on PC last year

[3:01:16] <Graxe_> The lore of Bandersnatches being a shitty attempt to mass produce even cheaper Tyrants is funny because they're such a failed product.

[3:02:03] <Renuarb> UUUUUUHHHN
[3:02:03] <ProfessorLitmus> hey Pat did you know that the Balrog gauntlets in DMC5 turn into those stupid hulk fists from DMC reboot when you use the sword master straight punch?
[3:02:11] <natebud> Wesker was scared by a video of Alexia. he knows she's in Antarctica.
[3:02:11] <%Aydarkzero> man Pat sure is having a great time
[3:02:11] <jorniev> SHANK THE ZOMBIE
[3:02:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Female zombie
[3:02:12] <%Nina96> remember when Pat was happy before playing this?
[3:02:18] <+worthwhile_off> @Cyoctane I don't see why they would put spiders in R3make when RE2make does not.
[3:02:21] <%FalseEyeD> STAB THE BUTT
[3:02:21] <+G_Thunders> Wouldn’t you get through this faster if you just shotgun’d these guys?
[3:02:23] <$RealThiele> having a wonderful time
[3:02:29] <+Estuko> punch the zombie in the boob, instant victory
[3:02:38] <+razielhex> @G_Thunders Pat has OCD and doesn't want to waste the bullets in case he needs them later.
[3:02:38] <the_gaming_bros1989> from memory i think the kinfe in this is better then all the kifes in RE history
[3:02:46] <%ranarath> @G_Thunders But then he'd use his precious item bullets.
[3:02:48] <+razielhex> (he will never need them later)
[3:02:51] <natebud> Did you turn off the gas in that last room? @AngriestPat
[3:02:58] <%Aydarkzero> lmao

[3:04:49] <EddieBrock> Silent rage is best rage.
[3:04:50] <%ospreyworks> Non controversial opinion: Billy is better than Steve.
[3:04:55] <%Aydarkzero> Dead Space has my all time favorite ambiance in a horror game

[3:05:14] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @Aydarkzero Yeah, it was great.
[3:05:16] <RoyallyFlushed> Steve is unironically one of the worst parts of this entire game
[3:05:16] <natebud> It's a little know fact that the people who made this game were actualyl evil

[3:06:10] <djazo> it is weird how a character can ruin a game this much
[3:06:11] <%ospreyworks> RE8 should bring Sheva back.
[3:06:11] <$RealThiele> cvx is low value so gotta add extra
[3:06:13] <@commanderclaw> "value"
[3:06:14] <cureneckbeard> Is FE# Encore the one that censors vagina bones or something
[3:06:16] <+BionoidLCR> @sporeian94 fuck god why
[3:06:18] <%shiplord13> What kind of value for this
[3:06:18] <nepwar> "give"

[3:06:24] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> That's nice of you Pat

[3:06:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> nah dude, this has been value enough. Please, rest your brain.

[3:06:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> @RealThiele LUL

[3:06:54] <Gamblor69> Come back when you got some money, buddy!
[3:06:56] <%ospreyworks> @happyface699 I’d play that.

[3:07:11] <majima666> i want to see pat go through the metal gear games
[3:07:13] <%DakotaMacDoodle> hope that new one is good
[3:07:17] <%Shadowpint> Code Veronica was part of the Biohazard Value pack tho
[3:07:19] <MassConnect> that achievement before the game even started was all the value I needed
[3:07:19] <natebud> CVX is scientifically designed piss you off.
[3:07:22] <majima666> i can live without mgs5 though
[3:07:24] <+lilgarbage_> This makes me want to play RE4
[3:07:25] <%happyface699> @ospreyworks Rebecca and wesker would be there
[3:07:27] <+Cyoctane> I have to confess... CVX was my first RE game
[3:07:28] <cureneckbeard> I like the metal gear.

[3:07:46] <%Nina96> yeah :(
[3:07:47] <%FalseEyeD> apatBig Bad Read
[3:07:48] <%DakotaMacDoodle> big let down
[3:07:49] <Meekest> Yeah the father we get away from MGSV the less highly anyone thinks of it
[3:07:53] <%Beough> that game pisses me off so fucking much
[3:07:56] <%harry417> But we gotta get to da albinoid at least
[3:07:57] <%Zebroneath> It gave us D-Dag, at least
[3:07:57] <ohgodscorpions> i cant agree enough
[3:07:58] <%dukenux> CV stands for CORE VALUE
[3:07:58] <%Nina96> also where did that come from?
[3:08:00] <fuchard1996> holy shit i was looking at the case of mgsv
[3:08:01] <EddieBrock> They use elevators now.
[3:08:02] <Takanub> Ah MGSV A game a played 80 hours of just to be like meh on it.
[3:08:02] <biomegabear> Ground Zeroes was better than 4
[3:08:02] <oniwahoo> But Cyborg Ninja vs Vampire!
[3:08:02] <DeaconTNR> Just need to replace that monster with alcohol
[3:08:03] <%PunishedMercer_> pointless as far as story content goes, but the gameplay was fine.
[3:08:04] <%ChaosAethr> What was pointles?
[3:08:05] <%Zebroneath> D-Dog*
[3:08:08] <%sporeian94> Metal Gear Solid 6 will have Grey Fox as the protag
[3:08:08] <%valkuma> The shame about MGS5 is its the natural progression of Peacewalker and also the best gameplay of a metal gear.. just horrible everything else
[3:08:08] <Arisato_II> Listen the memes that came out of MGS5 weren't pointless
[3:08:10] <%JJCheeker> Yeah the story of MGS 5 is kind of ughhh
[3:08:14] <$Jmann1892> Great Soundtrack tho
[3:08:16] <oniwahoo> Oh wait, he said 5
[3:08:18] <ithirstforfreddurst> hard agree
[3:08:18] <%Garthunox> @rcand9 pointless in terms of the story, mgsv is dogshit
[3:08:21] <%Sartastic> Never be game over
[3:08:22] <biomegabear> Ground zeroes or phantom pain?
[3:08:23] <$RealThiele> fire whale best boi
[3:08:26] <rcand9> kojima hasnt made a good game since 3
[3:08:26] <%ghostofsolomon> mgsv ENDING WAS SHIT
[3:08:27] <natebud> MGS5 is like 1/3 of a good game
[3:08:28] <%Nina96> yes
[3:08:29] <%StaceMcGate> People hate Pat because he spoke the truth
[3:08:31] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> MGS5's story was a letdown
[3:08:31] <nepwar> that one mission though
[3:08:32] <%AncelDeLambert> but Pat, woah ho
[3:08:33] <djazo> mgs5 his the best gameplay and worst everything LUL
[3:08:35] <%Divryne> Yikes.
[3:08:37] <%ospreyworks> I’m okay with Rebecca coming back in the mainline series if they remake 0 first and make her less irritating
[3:08:42] <%DakotaMacDoodle> open world was a mistake
[3:08:45] <%ghostofsolomon> THE LAST ACT OF THE GAME SUCKS ASS
[3:08:52] <%happyface699> @ospreyworks I love her she cute
[3:08:52] <Manjove> nah, Rebecca is hot
[3:08:55] <xanderfist> we will never get another good metal gear
[3:08:56] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> DID YOU RIKE IT?
[3:08:56] <fuchard1996> i liked the part where you fought tanks for 6 hours with quiet
[3:08:57] <RoyallyFlushed> Rebecca is cool, just not a good primary protagonist
[3:09:03] <%FalseEyeD> MGS4 should have just been a movie
[3:09:05] <+Estuko> @valkuma Yeah, though TBH Peace Walker is still my personal favorite. the coop and goofy side quests are a blast too. Dating Kaz
[3:09:13] <$RealThiele> open world is kojima being excited that MMOs bring people 'together' or some strand junk
[3:09:18] <%Darth_Buttz> Darth_Buttz subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:09:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't you have a +50% Magazine? Is that for the AK or AR?
[3:09:18] <%rufus2k2> Sheva needs to come back before Rebecca I'm bias but fuck it!
[3:09:32] <%Beough> The fact that MGSV got so many 10/10's with how narratively empty it is and just flips the fanbase off with the fucking end twist and the fact that the last act is just replays of previous missions, it sucks, so fucking bad, and this is coming from someone who loves Metal Gear Solid to death.
[3:09:33] <%happyface699> As I said make RE 8 have Rebecca, billy, sheva, and wesker
[3:09:33] <%sporeian94> Guys National Treasure 3 just got confirmed!
[3:09:34] <+Estuko> @FalseEyeD it's an interactive movie, lke those old ones where you use the universal remote to press a directional button LUL
[3:09:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> oh shit I didn't notice
[3:09:42] <%dukenux> Introducing Kojima to Open World was a mistake
[3:09:43] <biomegabear> are we 50% through the game yet?
[3:09:47] <Loving_Fox> Why does Pat have such good opinions? Maybe cause he is usually surrounded by bad ones ALL the time.
[3:09:50] <%Darth_Buttz> I picked the perfect game to subscribe with ayyyy yeah
[3:09:50] <nepwar> MGS5 gave birth to the unicorn zombie game
[3:09:51] <djazo> @estuko that game was great but the online is dead doodSad
[3:09:55] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> say whaaaa? Nat Treas 3?
[3:09:58] <natebud> It was like this with Max's stream, eventually just boredom and silence.
[3:10:01] <%ospreyworks> @royallyflushed She’s more likable in remake, but the fact that she goes from a capable main character in 0 to utterly helpless in 1 is weird.
[3:10:01] <warmnoid> LUL
[3:10:02] <%FalseEyeD> @Estuko MGS4 for the CD-I would be legit
[3:10:04] <fuchard1996> mgs3 tho
[3:10:06] <%Aydarkzero> something about those things having that much reach feels shitty
[3:10:13] <$grandark_z317> more like Coomersnatch
[3:10:14] <%rickyjones47> @biomegabear i think over 50% by now, just
[3:10:16] <%JJCheeker> I really hate those things
[3:10:18] <+Cyoctane> MGSV's twist made me retroactively un-enjoy everything I thought I liked before
[3:10:18] <ha2ken> That looks pretty hilarious when he hits you off-screen
[3:10:22] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Loving_Fox notkohThink
[3:10:26] <%JJCheeker> Their design is awful
[3:10:27] <+razielhex> It's a gentle push
[3:10:30] <%FalseEyeD> I feel bad for Pat, playing MGS5 is where all the fun is at
[3:10:33] <%JJCheeker> They look like s***
[3:10:35] <+junkheade227> This is the re game that needs a remake
[3:10:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> abuse stairs
[3:10:43] <majima666> @FalseEyeD funny you should say that, originally there was going to be a metal gear 3 on the 3do
[3:10:44] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> then they're ezpz
[3:10:45] <rcand9> i was just kidding about kojima i was hoping for more FUCK YOUSSS

[3:10:49] <+Estuko> @djazo Yeah FeelsBadMan my best friend who's went into the army played that damn game for hours and hours. xlink kai works + if you use the emulator and a friend who wants to play, there's a way to host and get coop to work. Did it before
[3:10:51] <majima666> imagine how different the series would have ended up
[3:10:54] <cureneckbeard> yuri's sister
[3:10:54] <rcand9> ture
[3:10:55] <trianglehat> huh
[3:10:56] <thatWaulfyguy> OH YA
[3:10:56] <RoyallyFlushed> @ospreyworks yeah it makes no sense for her to live thru the events of RE0 then be a cowering lil girl in the plot of 1, but that's prequels for you I guess
[3:10:57] <%StaceMcGate> You don't backseat MGS V
[3:10:57] <%FalseEyeD> YEP
[3:10:57] <rcand9> true
[3:10:57] <%ospreyworks> I’d love to see Claire and Sheva as a team, actually
[3:10:59] <%dukenux> ???
[3:11:01] <fuchard1996> liam gunjumping
[3:11:06] <+SkaiVibration> oof
[3:11:07] <%FalseEyeD> NOPE
[3:11:08] <rcand9> yeah kinda hell
[3:11:09] <%JJCheeker> Nope
[3:11:16] <%ranarath> That sounds horrible.
[3:11:16] <%Aydarkzero> @ospreyworks that would be amazing
[3:11:17] <rcand9> gameplays dope
[3:11:18] <+BionoidLCR> your not even snake
[3:11:21] <%DakotaMacDoodle> the game feels great everything else sadness
[3:11:22] <+BionoidLCR> just some fuck ass meddic
[3:11:23] <StarlitStunner> Gun Jumper Liam
[3:11:25] <cureneckbeard> who needs story when you have WOLBACHIA
[3:11:26] <thatWaulfyguy> Drop the Shield was never more applicable...
[3:11:28] <%Aydarkzero> i stopped playing mgsv after two missions
[3:11:28] <%NovaKnightmare> How do you feel about Death stranding in comparasion? @AngriestPat
[3:11:28] <natebud> ChipCheezum LP is the best thing we got out of MGSV
[3:11:30] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> didn't Pat and Liam end the last episode with a positive view?
[3:11:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I forgot... did you guys play it on the channel? I think I remember a dog on a balloon or a parachute or something?
[3:11:35] <SMuffinMan> Does anybody still say this game is better than 3?
[3:11:36] <EddieBrock> The series was never any better after 3.
[3:11:36] <$MildConviction> i couldn't even finish that LP
[3:11:37] <nepwar> yeah wathcing mgsV is the worst way to expierence it
[3:11:37] <%marsproject> Playing MGS5 by proxy? Yea that's not fun
[3:11:37] <%takiyami> I'm replaying it right now because I'm bored and it doesn't really hold up. The world is just so barebones. Even Death Stranding felt like it had better stealth dynamics.
[3:11:43] <%ospreyworks> Also, is it bad that I’d also love to see Chris killed off?
[3:11:50] <ha2ken> Ddog best doggo
[3:11:56] <%Aydarkzero> @ospreyworks kind of
[3:12:03] <majima666> mgs2 will always be my favourite. loved it back in 02 and love it even more today
[3:12:04] <%happyface699> @ospreyworks Kind of yeah
[3:12:07] <%ospreyworks> Like, it’d be one hell of a swerve and actually create some stakes
[3:12:08] <%FalseEyeD> I used some Gun Jumper tactics from that playthrough in my own run
[3:12:08] <DevilsLuck> Glad people woke up to realizing MGSV is trash
[3:12:08] <%rufus2k2> shoot him in the butt!
[3:12:11] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> To be fair 3 was basically the best MGS
[3:12:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> apatBig FRUSTRATION AMMO DUMBS
[3:12:19] <%FirearmsInstructor> *DUMPS
[3:12:19] <MassConnect> there are two types of franchises: everybody dies, nobody dies
[3:12:19] <natebud> 200% mad
[3:12:20] <RoyallyFlushed> Chris is the most boring RE protag, no doubt
[3:12:20] <cureneckbeard> MGSV is good, actually, and cool
[3:12:22] <%Aydarkzero> mgs2 is my favorite metal gear
[3:12:24] <%happyface699> @ospreyworks True but keep em
[3:12:25] <Tucker0603> Liam taking the absolute bare minimum kinda killed it for me
[3:12:30] <+storkeylope> Man those zombies
[3:12:30] <%StaceMcGate> MGS 3 remains best in the series
[3:12:33] <cureneckbeard> MGS2 sucks because of the fatman fight
[3:12:37] <djazo> @estuko oh man that must felt bad
[3:12:40] <%Shadowpint> It's fun, I don't play Kojima games for story because he's bad at writing
[3:12:42] <+storkeylope> Those zombie noises don’t get old do they?
[3:12:42] <rcand9> only mgs 3 had better gameplay than 5 and 5 was still an overall bad game
[3:12:43] <EddieBrock> Lol.
[3:12:44] <trianglehat> isn't there?
[3:12:45] <SuperHoppedUp> I've played MGSV for the last four or fives years in a row. I can say the best thing about that game is the extreme levels of bullshit you can do that adds almost nothing to the actual gameplay. Like being able to kill bosses by rolling into them in a barrel.
[3:12:46] <cureneckbeard> you can paurse the tapes. they're tapes
[3:12:46] <$RealThiele> so same old same old
[3:12:46] <fuchard1996> YOU'RE GONNA EXTRACT HIM?

[3:13:05] <%Shadowpint> If he makes a movie it's going to suck ass
[3:13:06] <ProfessorLitmus> you can pause those tapes Pat
[3:13:07] <red_blaster> VOCAL CORD PARASITES
[3:13:11] <%dukenux> @angriestpat it weird cause i enjoyed watching you and others play Death Stranding, which seems to have similar open world structure
[3:13:11] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I wish 1,2 and 3 would get a pc release
[3:13:11] <%takiyami> That too, not having any shortcuts for the cassette player was a really bad oversight.
[3:13:11] <Arisato_II> Damn women ruining MGS5 for Pat
[3:13:12] <DevilsLuck> Its just an unfinished mess , and I miss the original VA
[3:13:12] <King_thunder365> WORDS THAT KILL
[3:13:13] <worldbrand> you can pause them but it's kind of a hassle if you're trying to listen to them while, like, stealthing iirc
[3:13:13] <ThorgrimFunhammer> oh hey fart gas
[3:13:14] <majima666> fatmans great
[3:13:15] <natebud> Frankenburger
[3:13:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> the decision to include important story elements in those tapes was a mistake since Peacewalker.
[3:13:17] <%dukenux> and pacing
[3:13:17] <%StaceMcGate> Quiet's theme is dope tho
[3:13:18] <srkAres> you can totally pause the tapes pat
[3:13:18] <%Aydarkzero> LANGUAGE
[3:13:18] <%MayorRev> @AngriestPat is ground zeroes okay?
[3:13:19] <SuperHoppedUp> Wait I'm thinking of 4... ncm :P
[3:13:19] <SleepyMaribo> the fact that they had this huge battle plannedout for the finale and you only see it in stencil and drawn art angeredme so bad.
[3:13:20] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I had fun, but I had fun because I literally stole every single person and piece of equipment that it was possible to steal
[3:13:20] <ithirstforfreddurst> @AngriestPat friendly reminder of the Quiet playing with Venom Snake in the rain scene
[3:13:20] <%FalseEyeD> VOCO CORD PARA SITES

[3:13:43] <chasew801> man the limp looks kinda dumb
[3:13:43] <Texascourierlive> Add
[3:13:44] <%ospreyworks> Would it have been better to have Jill actually perma-killed or have Chris die? I’m curious as to who people like more.
[3:13:45] <King_thunder365> WITH YOUR BRRRRRRRRRRREEEATH SOOO STILL, IT MAAAAAAAAAAAAKES ME BELIEEEEEEEEEEVE
[3:13:46] <theaterunderground> quiet wont shut up though
[3:13:46] <+BlockingDisabled> I didn't like the whole base development stuff...
[3:13:46] <%FirearmsInstructor> WHAT JUST HAPPENED

[3:13:47] <DevilsLuck> @ithirstforfreddurst Kill me.... i forgot about that

[3:14:42] <SirAlan76> yeah
[3:14:43] <%StaceMcGate> good lord, how much of this game is left?
[3:14:46] <oyyzzo> you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn
[3:14:50] <$Jmann1892> hells yeah it was
[3:14:51] <KingKZ> This game doesn't seem worth it.
[3:15:00] <fireking900> @AngriestPat what other games do you feel like LPing ruined for you and what games were better becuase you LPed?
[3:15:02] <%FalseEyeD> LUL
[3:15:03] <natebud> At least a third of the game left.
[3:15:04] <DevilsLuck> I like how nice Emu make ps2 games look
[3:15:06] <RoyallyFlushed> @StaceMcGate lots
[3:15:09] <%sporeian94> How much did you pay for it?
[3:15:10] <%FirearmsInstructor> THIS GAME AIN'T WORTH A BUCKET O PISS!!
[3:15:10] <%JJCheeker> I hate being low health
[3:15:13] <majima666> imagine if this ended up to be the actual re3
[3:15:14] <%ospreyworks> Seems like such a cop-out thay none of the primary characters have died when the series has been going on for 23 years
[3:15:15] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat I just played MGSV like a kidnapping simulator, and its fucking great for that. No one to fight or detect you when they're all floating through the stratosphere
[3:15:21] <Jrocy247> So wait, what exactly happened?
[3:15:26] <King_thunder365> "Only a couple hours left guys, right?"

[3:15:51] <biomegabear> I perfected RIDE 2 HELL
[3:15:52] <%Chatterbox1991> Ride to Hell is probably the best one of that

[3:15:52] <%dukenux> Sadness Series Kappa
[3:15:55] <ProfessorLitmus> bugmisland was great as an LP
[3:15:57] <%Storm_Samurai> Random fact: This was last of the canonical Resident Evil titles to use the names of actual gun manufacturers (excluding Magnum) and firearms within the game. All the subsequent Resident Evil titles (Resident Evil remake, Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil 4) used generic or made-up names for their weapons (i.e: Silver Serpent, Broken Butterfly, Blacktail).
[3:16:00] <%King_floppy> I have no mouth and I must scream was a big damned winner @angriestpat

[3:16:11] <%Garthunox> LA Noire is already great but the lp was so amazing
[3:16:11] <%Psyramics> if you play a bad game by yourself, you sit there thinking 'wtf am i doing with my life' and drop it

[3:16:22] <tuesti> @Storm_Samurai that's interesting!
[3:16:24] <RoyallyFlushed> a "remake" of CVX would have to be the most start from scratch effort seen so far to turn it into something of value

[3:16:44] <%ospreyworks> @zaphire_saucypants I mean, compare the lackluster original RE1 to the remake. Just imagine starting from the ground with this one, and added scenarios like the Lisa Trevor plotline.
[3:16:47] <+Estuko> @biomegabear the painful awkwardness of watching the human princess kiss sonic's enormous face is still burrowed within me
[3:16:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Omikron was the beginning of the end
[3:16:51] <%mrcelab> @AngriestPat Pat, Offtopic question, sorry in advance, do You still keep in touch with Mat an Liam? Just havent heard You mention them in a long time.
[3:16:53] <%trekkie11041> @AngriestPat you should take the glock
[3:16:54] <%jillvxlentine> the silent hill 2 lp was good
[3:17:05] <%happyface699> @ospreyworks Definitely
[3:17:11] <Renuarb> Way of the Samurai 4 LP was underrated
[3:17:17] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> the bowgun does less damage with Chris
[3:17:18] <nepwar> wheres the TMP?
[3:17:22] <natebud> Because it works like the grenade launcher should.
[3:17:30] <biomegabear> @Estuko compared to watching Jake fuck several girls via dry hump?>
[3:17:30] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Kiefer Sutherland was a mistake
[3:17:31] <djazo> @angriestpat the funniest thing about mgs5 that if you skip all of the cutscene the game becomes better LUL
[3:17:34] <%rufus2k2> LOL Chris is a manlet!
[3:17:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why would you even *CONSIDER* the handgun anymore???
[3:17:40] <MassConnect> I'm getting severe deja vu. Didn't pat already say days ago that he "already had enough ammo to beat whatever game he was playing"
[3:17:41] <%Garthunox> @mrcelab they ain't friends dude, do you keep in touch with people you arent friends with?
[3:17:42] <RoyallyFlushed> to be fair, original RE1 wasn't lackluster in its respective time
[3:17:45] <%ospreyworks> @happyface699 like, the shit that is this game is making me want to just sit down and draw concept art for the idea of a remake
[3:17:45] <SuperHoppedUp> Deadly P was definitely better LPed
[3:17:48] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Kiefer Sutherland was unironically better than David Hayter
[3:17:53] <%jillvxlentine> whats pat gearing up for?
[3:17:54] <%rufus2k2> still taller than me tho :(
[3:17:55] <%JJCheeker> kotor was a good
[3:17:59] <nepwar> way of the samurai was an unfinished LP because they didn't get the true end
[3:18:05] <$DevilsLuck> Never @ThatOneGuyYouSaw
[3:18:06] <trackles_64> Rememer when we had to save in videogames i do
[3:18:08] <%takiyami> Kiefer's performance was fine for like the 5 minutes total of dialogue he had
[3:18:12] <%StaceMcGate> ???
[3:18:12] <%Aydarkzero> sounds like a whole lotta nothing
[3:18:12] <%FirearmsInstructor> LOL
[3:18:13] <This_is_Marco> D:
[3:18:15] <reonome> FUCK
[3:18:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> Ink ribbons
[3:18:17] <Kiraklene> LUL
[3:18:17] <%rufus2k2> post MGS3 Haytr's snake became parody tier
[3:18:17] <SleepyMaribo> forgot the ribbins
[3:18:17] <+CarlosEoM> LUL
[3:18:17] <CoffeeSlice> D:
[3:18:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I enjoyed Kiefer Sutherlands performance....just wish there had been more of it.
[3:18:19] <%croxeye> ayyy lmao
[3:18:20] <%Ion_Laser> LOL
[3:18:23] <+Estuko> @biomegabear That was also terrible, difference is the budget thrown right into it and how serious it took itself .. lol
[3:18:23] <xanderfist> no way David Hayter all the way
[3:18:23] <%marsproject> Resident Evil Walking Simulator anyone?
[3:18:25] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[3:18:26] <%dukenux> LUL
[3:18:29] <Jack964b> I like this save room theme. Is there anything else worthwhile in this game?
[3:18:32] <oyyzzo> crankiest pat
[3:18:35] <%Kegeto> no worries
[3:18:39] <%Garthunox> @nepwar by that logic neither is Cat Lady or KoToR
[3:18:40] <ithirstforfreddurst> pretty sure it was less than that
[3:18:41] <%ospreyworks> @royallyflushed Nah, for its time it was the shit, but after seeing Pat play 2 so much and then going back to 1, it’s amazing how much better the sequel was
[3:18:42] <Arisato_II> He says things like "D.D!"
[3:18:43] <%Aydarkzero> Kept ya waiting tripleHUH
[3:18:45] <rcand9> yup
[3:18:49] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah great actor barely used
[3:18:50] <warmnoid> Boss saying nothing to Skullface during the ride is the highlight of the game
[3:18:53] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan "Santa's real!"
[3:18:59] <Arisato_II> Snake?
[3:19:00] <rcand9> he does a great job just so little of it
[3:19:02] <natebud> I would have been fine with Kiefer if David Hayter voiced real snake.
[3:19:03] <Arisato_II> Shuting up?
[3:19:07] <SailingSaturn> and Peace Walker cirNom
[3:19:07] <cureneckbeard> snake should be the one called "Quiet"! !
[3:19:09] <nepwar> @Garthunox yes
[3:19:11] <djazo> @angriestpat remember rule of the rose how everything in that game was good but the gamplay was shit
[3:19:11] <Arisato_II> Voice acting?
[3:19:12] <biomegabear> @Estuko At least Level design in 06 and the music is good and plays when it shoul. Ride 2 hell sometimes has no music playing
[3:19:13] <%Aydarkzero> thanks Kojima
[3:19:13] <majima666> hayter might not be the BEST voice actor. but he is the voice of snake, full stop
[3:19:15] <%Jane_Lo> cause it would require money, but konami (or kojima?) is like "nah but we want a star tho"
[3:19:15] <%sporeian94> Death Stranding kinda had that to. That's the problem with real actors they don't wanna speak that much
[3:19:15] <%Storm_Samurai> Why do they not talk at all
[3:19:17] <worldbrand> thinking about that ride makes me a little upset
[3:19:18] <warmnoid> WORDS THAT KILL
[3:19:19] <rytisone> didn't he win an award?
[3:19:20] <thatWaulfyguy> OHHHH WOOOOOAH
[3:19:20] <%rufus2k2> but the thing is wouldn't the JP voices be done first
[3:19:21] <fuchard1996> the SIIIIIIIINS NEVA DIE
[3:19:21] <%Tracazoid> Yeah and it was some excuse to make it like Fury Road with Max or something.
[3:19:22] <$DevilsLuck> Let me forget about this game
[3:19:24] <+whackashack> Cause it wasn't snake!
[3:19:24] <EddieBrock> And Kojima acts like everyone loved Kiefer.
[3:19:25] <%ospreyworks> Original 2 holds up so much better than 1
[3:19:26] <%Zebroneath> It's baffling why they didn't cut the truck scene
[3:19:26] <majima666> its such an iconic gravelly voice
[3:19:27] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> b-but self insert!
[3:19:28] <%rufus2k2> so Akio Otsuka got screwed harder
[3:19:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Maaaan the truck ride
[3:19:30] <%MayorRev> @AngriestPat i've only played Twin Snakes and V, which ones should i play
[3:19:32] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat but I have the same issue with Norman Reedus in DS. He barely interacts with 90% of cutscenes/radio calls
[3:19:37] <%spongeofmystery> Took that trip at night and it looked embarrasing
[3:19:37] <%FalseEyeD> Kojima is a Star Fucker, to be sure
[3:19:39] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I made it funnier by constantly turning on and off my night vision
[3:19:39] <trackles_64> I miss metal gear tactics
[3:19:40] <SoaringLettuce> oh but don't you get it? it's because it's NOT SNAKE lol
[3:19:41] <fuchard1996> he keeps mugging at the camera too
[3:19:41] <%takiyami> Anyways I gotta go to work, enjoy the suffering everybody
[3:19:43] <%dukenux> WHOHOOOOOAAAA
[3:19:46] <cureneckbeard> he didn't even have a bath song. that's what MGSV needed. ba ba ba ban ban ban
[3:19:46] <+Estuko> @biomegabear you're right, christ. parts of ride to hell lmao, what fun.
[3:19:52] <majima666> i want david hayter to read me bedtime stories
[3:19:55] <rcand9> BUUT BUTT medic is a different character BLEH
[3:19:55] <EddieBrock> I'm shocked Norman talked as much as he did.
[3:19:55] <HorribleHog> It woulda been so intense if they had argued good point the whole way there
[3:19:55] <%Aydarkzero> cause he's a nerd Kappa
[3:19:56] <red_blaster> But that goes with that character
[3:19:57] <%Garthunox> @angriestpat I unironically love you shitting on stuff
[3:19:59] <%jillvxlentine> hes the stoic type
[3:19:59] <%FalseEyeD> It's in character at least
[3:19:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> David Hayter was good in 1 and 2, then he went to shit by PW
[3:19:59] <%Verd_254> At least that fits with his character
[3:20:05] <natebud> Now this is a minecraft lp
[3:20:08] <%dukenux> he just grunts
[3:20:08] <jinking79> well yeah your not playing the Boss
[3:20:11] <NickHatesSnow> This is a negative game to stream huh
[3:20:17] <%VashyronM> Movie and tv actors are expensive
[3:20:24] <%VashyronM> Voice actors are underpaid
[3:20:31] <djazo> minecraft lp was godlike LUL
[3:20:31] <%meltdown547> I honestly prefer the better stuff.
[3:20:31] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[3:20:32] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yyyup...if paying big name actors is such a chore that you HAVE to write them as monosyllabic or whatever, don't even bother.
[3:20:33] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Your criticisms are accurate and justified and reasonable.
[3:20:34] <%jillvxlentine> youre the most critical about the stuff that you love
[3:20:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:20:35] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you're at peak salt levels right now with the Smash reveal and playing this game
[3:20:36] <%Hilleltaco> That's the happy sound
[3:20:38] <MassConnect> I think Pat is best known for being super wrong
[3:20:38] <%MayorRev> Do you think they'll put MGS on switch?
[3:20:38] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:20:40] <%Aydarkzero> bleh
[3:20:41] <%Ixiah> just put a small hat on the spider
[3:20:42] <%Garthunox> You're fairly critical, but you're critically fair too
[3:20:43] <%ospreyworks> I love when Pat finds enjoyment in the midst of his hatred.
[3:20:43] <+Estuko> monkaS 4
[3:20:45] <%Darth_Buttz> I always heard this game was boring, holy shit was I not ready for it. apatWhat

[3:20:48] <tuesti> its never safe

[3:20:49] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I just want an MGS3 pc port
[3:20:49] <nepwar> its never see in CVX
[3:20:50] <rytisone> the blood puddle
[3:20:51] <%JJCheeker> This no happy
[3:20:51] <DavidSanChan> what do you think this is a video game
[3:20:51] <Renuarb> REEEEEE
[3:20:52] <%Verd_254> why does a grenade launcher sound like a suppressed pistol?
[3:20:52] <RoyallyFlushed> Wesker trained them to die silently, with HONOR
[3:20:52] <biomegabear> @Estuko Yeah I found that you can make the casino object in a level dissapear because they dont close a dor so its a en empty scary room
[3:20:53] <natebud> Fuck off with this game
[3:20:53] <$Jmann1892> thats so bad
[3:20:54] <KwameWithThePowerOfEarth> it's never safe :)
[3:20:55] <Explodincatz> make a death scream for it
[3:20:55] <HorribleHog> it's for enhance the horor
[3:20:56] <%rufus2k2> that was a well trained Hunter
[3:20:58] <%spongeofmystery> death scream was patched out
[3:21:00] <Arisato_II> I love how the grenade launcher sounds like suppressor
[3:21:02] <%passthehanky> man i gotta be real i have not actually paid attention to the screen in like... 25 minutes
[3:21:04] <%Frostydough1> Death Sranding: Diehard - Man: Yo go interact with this person Sam: NO
[3:21:05] <majima666> sadly any future releases of mgs2 and 3 will be gimped because none of the controllers have pressure sensitive buttons
[3:21:07] <oyyzzo> this particular one was a mute
[3:21:08] <+BubbaRands> “””influencer”””
[3:21:09] <%passthehanky> i'm just here for the pat at this point
[3:21:09] <%dukenux> apatFist
[3:21:10] <%MayorRev> I wish MGS was good
[3:21:12] <%Aydarkzero> Enhanced Handgun monkaS
[3:21:13] <$DevilsLuck> have to take a leap of faith is all
[3:21:14] <rytisone> 1.99 for death screams
[3:21:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I now understand why you took the handgun :) LUL
[3:21:15] <%FalseEyeD> This was the only game this director directed
[3:21:17] <xanderfist> in space no one can hear hunters scream
[3:21:17] <trackles_64> Anyone looking forward to the new Resident Evil movie?.
[3:21:17] <%Kegeto> it was very lw
[3:21:19] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:21:22] <KaijuVania> Trophy calebPog
[3:21:29] <natebud> Modified, it's modified.
[3:21:30] <+TheBeanHole> I love and hate this game all at the same time.
[3:21:31] <djazo> i mean that.s why 1.3 thousand people are watching
[3:21:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat That's a Glock 17C now
[3:21:33] <%Kegeto> low*
[3:21:36] <%rufus2k2> big guns for big boys!
[3:21:37] <nepwar> the bullets go faster
[3:21:38] <ohgodscorpions> Glock perfection
[3:21:38] <SoaringLettuce> ok so I'm gonna ask: why is this game so bad?
[3:21:40] <%StaceMcGate> If RE3 Remake is delayed, was this whole endeavor pointless?
[3:21:43] <%Aydarkzero> @trackles_64 live action or cgi?
[3:21:43] <MSN04_Sazabi> Patriarchy at work, Claire only gets 70% of firepower
[3:21:47] <cureneckbeard> Do you get Claire back after this? Can you put his gun in the box and now Claire has good gun?
[3:21:49] <+REDtheBEAST> Glock Kappa
[3:21:52] <+Wizardism> I never got this far in this game because I was just sick and tired of it after you leave the mansion.
[3:21:54] <natebud> Well there green goo in that last room?
[3:21:57] <rcand9> i love handguns upgrading in RE games
[3:21:59] <%rufus2k2> @StaceMcGate well it means RE4 isn't off the table now
[3:22:04] <majima666> so this or 0 pat?
[3:22:08] <Milo_Oda> clairs gun was just kinda lying around outside
[3:22:09] <majima666> id still pick this over 0
[3:22:10] <FG_Leo106> im glad This section is almost over
[3:22:15] <%TheSphereHunter> RE3R is done already
[3:22:17] <trackles_64> @Aydarkzero I think live action reboot is next, we just had an animated one.
[3:22:19] <%voidthieff> voidthieff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! code veronica is bad
[3:22:20] <rytisone> it will not get delayed, capcom said
[3:22:21] <Meekest> You would if you stuck to your schedule LUL
[3:22:21] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat get some cocaine
[3:22:21] <SoaringLettuce> like, what circumstances led to this game being so poorly designed?
[3:22:26] <%FalseEyeD> thesph1SUELUV thesph1SUELUV thesph1SUELUV
[3:22:26] <oniwahoo> I believe in Pat
[3:22:27] <%ospreyworks> Man, there are so many good Pat moments from old LPs where he managed to pull out a laugh in the middle of suffering.
[3:22:29] <%passthehanky> hey suzi!
[3:22:29] <sugarveins> @thespherehunter
[3:22:29] <%marsproject> @AngriestPat I dunno I think you're making good progress.
[3:22:31] <sugarveins> VoHiYo
[3:22:35] <%FalseEyeD> Yeah, RE3R is basically done
[3:22:36] <RoyallyFlushed> well step 1 is to quit dying
[3:22:38] <%dukenux> schedule Kappa
[3:22:40] <Meekest> But we wanna watch you play RE6
[3:22:40] <%AdmiralHats> AdmiralHats subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:22:43] <FG_Leo106> Suzi!!!
[3:22:44] <Vitoria90> Yo Suzi~
[3:22:44] <+SixxMakaveli> With how CVX is, this is a big stall
[3:22:45] <rcand9> hey suzi
[3:22:46] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> OH NOOOOOOO
[3:22:49] <indig0bird> Oh it's Suzi! She's cool
[3:22:49] <%Garthunox> woo
[3:22:50] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> Oh shit
[3:22:53] <%dukenux> yeyeye
[3:22:53] <natebud> Who would have thought?
[3:22:54] <SoaringLettuce> why aren't we calling it 3MAKE?
[3:22:55] <%ospreyworks> Especially on Peach’s stream
[3:22:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> @TheSphereHunter notkohWave
[3:22:57] <ohgodscorpions> like when tfs was worried they wouldnt be able to get through all the k8ngdom hearts and then it was delayed 2 years
[3:22:57] <%Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:22:57] <%FalseEyeD> WHUT UP WITH THAT
[3:23:00] <oniwahoo> I'm pretty sure Pat could beat RE4 in 2 streams
[3:23:00] <%Ion_Laser> lol
[3:23:01] <djazo> SUZI IS BACK YAY
[3:23:03] <%Zebroneath> A Sphere Hunter has appeared
[3:23:03] <%mistermastergreg> SUUUUUUZZZ
[3:23:06] <trackles_64> The nemesis trailer in the remake is terrifying
[3:23:09] <%StaceMcGate> SOUND OF SILENCE
[3:23:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> laaaaame
[3:23:15] <%Darth_Buttz> Nemesis in the remake looks AWESOME
[3:23:17] <nepwar> whats the deal with these silent hunters
[3:23:18] <+Schlomogoldbergsteinowitz> why is this game so limp
[3:23:18] <FG_Leo106> Suzi, when are you streaming CVX?
[3:23:20] <%mrcelab> What? Pat, You are RE Pro, what the hell? You must know where every spinel is. Youll make it!
[3:23:20] <%Garthunox> she does great videos, go watch her
[3:23:22] <AudaxSmoke> but that pool of blurd tells a thousand stories silently
[3:23:22] <SoaringLettuce> 3MAKE has a nice ring to it
[3:23:26] <+G_Thunders> Did the hunters have a death noise in RE3?
[3:23:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck no
[3:23:28] <biomegabear> Maybe young pat
[3:23:28] <%Verd_254> that grenade launcher sound is what gets me
[3:23:29] <BluBox> Bruh
[3:23:30] <%vaporousTippler> The hunters are big name actors by the point CVX came out and they couldn't afford lengthy recording sessions.
[3:23:30] <%Aydarkzero> Pat is clearly a pro Kappa
[3:23:32] <%jillvxlentine> thats ambitious
[3:23:33] <$RealThiele> RE3R just got a lot more play time from people on release after all the delays this week
[3:23:33] <martmartez> feed nana?!
[3:23:34] <%AdmiralHats> How long has the stream been going? I always miss the beginning
[3:23:34] <%Darth_Buttz> You don't understand, RE 4 is LONG
[3:23:35] <rcand9> pats negativity is effecting chat
[3:23:35] <%DetroitSentai> RE4 is way longer than most people remember
[3:23:37] <%dukenux> 3
[3:23:37] <%FirearmsInstructor> @oniwahoo That's an extremely high vote of confidence
[3:23:40] <%GunEden> two streams worth of safety dance
[3:23:40] <+lilgarbage_> We saw the LP
[3:23:40] <%Mariakko> People forget how long RE4 is.
[3:23:40] <%StaceMcGate> Graveyard puzzle
[3:23:41] <%Garthunox> 2 words, water, room
[3:23:42] <%passthehanky> just learn speedrun strats 4head
[3:23:42] <worldbrand> PUZZLE
[3:23:45] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but I beat RE4 in one sitting
[3:23:46] <%rufus2k2> silent hunters? what is this a submarine sim?!
[3:23:47] <NickHatesSnow> Pat can do it in one
[3:23:51] <majima666> i went through the ps4 version of re4 not that long ago. i wasn't big on re4 at the time of release.....but man, is it a GOOD game
[3:23:53] <+SixxMakaveli> re4 is a good 3, 4 streams
[3:23:54] <%Darth_Buttz> The whole path through the castle and shit alone would take an entire stream
[3:23:57] <+CarlosEoM> that a good video game
[3:24:01] <nepwar> pat pro gamer only drops the weight when he must protect his ninja way
[3:24:01] <natebud> sure why not
[3:24:03] <SoaringLettuce> I finished re4 in 17 hours this month
[3:24:04] <%Darth_Buttz> But it's a good ass video game
[3:24:05] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> twice I think
[3:24:06] <rcand9> is good game to play it man
[3:24:07] <%Hilleltaco> Don't worry it was good words
[3:24:07] <%Aydarkzero> Castle feels like it takes forever sometimes
[3:24:08] <DeniedPants> @AngriestPat If you do get to RE5, would you consider doing it co-op with Paige?
[3:24:09] <$DevilsLuck> hmm maybe it is longer than i remember
[3:24:10] <+albedo455> 3rd pact meh
[3:24:10] <%FalseEyeD> gud game play et
[3:24:12] <%Verd_254> you're the one who said it don't look at us
[3:24:13] <djazo> you can beat it in one stream i bleve in you
[3:24:15] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat What direction could RE8 take the series?
[3:24:15] <SoaringLettuce> wasn't rushing
[3:24:16] <Deadbulky> Pat since ur league streamer now u gonna play some legends of runeterra on the 23rd
[3:24:16] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Good feely button push
[3:24:17] <%passthehanky> cvx is breaking your brain pat maybe it's time for 0
[3:24:17] <+Wizardism> I think re4 is good, not perfect, just really good though
[3:24:19] <%DakotaMacDoodle> re4 is always a good time
[3:24:23] <%ospreyworks> @angriestpat you gonna use the Remake and 4 HD texture mods?
[3:24:24] <codesounds> Re4 = the best pace ing in gaming
[3:24:24] <%ghostofsolomon> ahhhh the cvx virus is kicking in
[3:24:26] <$RealThiele> spanish napoleon creates parasite to kill enemies, ezpz
[3:24:28] <+Eddy21forsaken> plus pat has to do the ada side content too, right?????
[3:24:29] <%dukenux> @rufus2k2 theres actually a submarine in previous chapters
[3:24:30] <+Grayhammatter> a good game to play it
[3:24:32] <%mrcelab> Have You ever streamed with Woollie at Your place?
[3:24:34] <%Darth_Buttz> RE 4 stays at like a 9 the whole time and most games can't say that.
[3:24:35] <fairore> hey chat hows it going
[3:24:38] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I would say RE4 is the most fun out of all RE
[3:24:40] <majima666> pat should do re1.5 just for shits and giggles
[3:24:42] <%FalseEyeD> RE4 isn't for me, but I respect the hell out of it
[3:24:42] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat I dunno. Aside from the Regenerators, the Military Island just feels like a boring slog
[3:24:43] <oniwahoo> Guess we'll see what happens ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[3:24:48] <%rufus2k2> you know what I just thought of, a Resident evil spinoff using cards like MG Ac!d
[3:24:49] <$MildConviction> @AngriestPat How do you feel about people who hate RE4 because they blame it for the series's shift into action?
[3:24:59] <FG_Leo106> i like RE5 more than RE4
[3:24:59] <%happyface699> @mildconviction Idiots
[3:25:05] <%Aydarkzero> JJ is rad

[3:25:20] <%rufus2k2> THAT WAS A SCREAM
[3:25:21] <%spongeofmystery> Game stops being horror after the giant Salazar statue
[3:25:23] <%rufus2k2> Y'ALL HEARD IT
[3:25:25] <djazo> and the regin are really cool
[3:25:27] <%Darth_Buttz> Then it feels like a cheesy bad horror movie after Salazar
[3:25:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Meester Kennedy
[3:25:29] <fairore> is pat almost done with code veronica
[3:25:29] <Ipsenscastle> I also like 5 more than 4
[3:25:29] <HorribleHog> Vulcan JJ
[3:25:30] <RoyallyFlushed> each RE game shifted more and more to action, anyway
[3:25:31] <natebud> Raiders fans
[3:25:31] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @FalseEyeD agreed, I enjoy the game, but as an action romp, not a resident evil
[3:25:33] <%Darth_Buttz> either that or an 80s movie
[3:25:42] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> RE4 was just campy and dumb, RE5 took a turn for the stupid
[3:25:45] <majima666> what baffles me is why they just didnt have it with chris and jill instead of sheva. not that sheva herself is a bad character though
[3:25:45] <RoyallyFlushed> RE2 has way more action than RE1, and 3 amped it up from 2
[3:25:45] <ohgodscorpions> nonsence
[3:25:45] <+Estuko> PogChamp hi pat
[3:25:46] <%mrcelab> Are You gonna coop other Re's with Paige?

[3:25:56] <+Cyoctane> @AngriestPat Iceborne 2020 roadmap is tomorrow, how many/which monsters do you expect?
[3:25:56] <%Storm_Samurai> What is Pat?
[3:25:56] <%spoonbruh> Maybe the hunters don’t scream because enemies respawn? @angriestpat
[3:25:59] <$DevilsLuck> @AngriestPat Stop you're talking in third person again
[3:26:00] <nepwar> wait i thought this was louis ck?
[3:26:00] <biomegabear> When I was on the outside of the castle is a hard part
[3:26:01] <+REDtheBEAST> You are Pat?! tomatoD
[3:26:04] <$RealThiele> pat make BIG funny
[3:26:05] <%dukenux> it gets back to being horror when you encounter Regenerators
[3:26:05] <%Aydarkzero> yeah it's fun
[3:26:07] <%Storm_Samurai> Baba is Pat?
[3:26:07] <%DakotaMacDoodle> why is Pat?

[3:26:12] <%FalseEyeD> his mind is going, again
[3:26:13] <majima666> do you smell what the pat is cooking
[3:26:14] <%miguelrod777> Pat thinks he smells
[3:26:14] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> sugoiLain Pat?
[3:26:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The huge walking Salazar statue is PRETTY STUPID
[3:26:15] <rytisone> Is this Patrick?
[3:26:16] <cureneckbeard> I think that's humourous also. My favourite is when Pat says "I'm Pat".
[3:26:17] <%Storm_Samurai> Pat is Baba
[3:26:18] <FG_Leo106> oh this puzzle haha
[3:26:19] <+Estuko> @happyface699 Ahh, I remember watching them jump at me from the ground the first time. Or that fucking body bag in the huge garbage bin
[3:26:19] <%dukenux> no im Pat :)
[3:26:21] <%ospreyworks> It could be argued that the shift to action started with this game? It’s not nearly as scary as it’s trying to be.
[3:26:21] <fairore> @natebud that's not wanted to see DansGame FailFish
[3:26:22] <%Razputin217> Where is Pat?
[3:26:24] <%Shadowpint> I love when Pat talks in the 3rd person so much
[3:26:25] <HorribleHog> No this is Pat
[3:26:25] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ehhh...almost every RE game starts out spooky, but there comes a point where the puzzles and silliness ramp up till it become Sillytown Action, USA
[3:26:27] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy, here we go
[3:26:27] <%StaceMcGate> If Baba is you, if you get rid of Baba
[3:26:28] <This_is_Marco> No Me :)
[3:26:28] <%rickyjones47> finished RE 4 about 5 times. i love it
[3:26:29] <nepwar> why is pat?
[3:26:30] <majima666> the pats laying the smackdown
[3:26:31] <munchkay> You're not Pat, we're all Pat
[3:26:32] <djazo> anything would be fun after this
[3:26:34] <%Aydarkzero> are there any other Pats i should know about?
[3:26:36] <worldbrand> Is this the Krusty Krab?
[3:26:36] <DavidSanChan> Pat is many, we are few
[3:26:36] <$RealThiele> the sun will go down, on pats stream, betcha bottom dollar

[3:26:53] <%Aydarkzero> uhh
[3:27:04] <djazo> the gameplay loop in RE4 is godlike
[3:27:05] <%dukenux> 2*
[3:27:08] <rcand9> fill it up good
[3:27:11] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> But its stupid in a funny way, not stupid in the "ancient laser beam puzzle" kind of way
[3:27:11] <oyyzzo> is chris near-sighted?
[3:27:13] <%FalseEyeD> Die Hard with a Vengeance up in here
[3:27:13] <%Shadowpint> What even is this puzzle

[3:28:35] <MassConnect> You know, I'd like to see a game where a zombie falling backward actually knocks other zombies over
[3:28:36] <%QuietusPlays> did I miss the part where chris yells about the redfield bloodline?
[3:28:37] <nepwar> the person holding the gun is chris instead of jill so theres a difference

[3:46:55] <%marsproject> How come Chris is not slipping on the ice?
[3:46:58] <$RealThiele> tell them to FREEZE
[3:46:59] <FG_Leo106> revisiting the Artatic Base is the best part of the game imo
[3:46:59] <%Aydarkzero> doesn't somebody at Capcom hate Rebecca or something?
[3:47:01] <%CalderGaming> I may have been very wrong
[3:47:02] <%Shackle_Rustyford> in release i mean
[3:47:02] <%theKingRamses> @majima666 they could always put 0 and 1 together to remake in the new engine
[3:47:04] <%Shadowpint> Imagine if it was tank controls plus being slippery on ice
[3:47:05] <+lilgarbage_> The foot sliding makes sense now cause of the ice
[3:47:05] <%dukenux> why does this look like Antarctic?
[3:47:09] <$RealThiele> never have to cum

[3:47:36] <%D3rrtyD4n> byeee
[3:47:38] <%ospreyworks> Considering how fast the RE2 remake outsold the lifetime sales of 2, Capcom would be silly not to think about remaking as many of these as possible.

[3:47:38] <oniwahoo> Zombos are super stronk
[3:47:40] <Daxalog> He would have no leverage to move holy shit

[3:48:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> He just did it
[3:48:04] <+Javaa01> So what you're saying is that most scares in this game aren't scares
[3:48:06] <%dukenux> WTF ZOMBIES? IN THIS GAME?
[3:48:13] <FG_Leo106> Pat, dont forget the Fire Extinguisher :)
[3:48:16] <%spongeofmystery> Oh no, more pistol fodder
[3:48:18] <+Drivingatank> @AngriestPat What would you say is the worst resident evil?
[3:48:20] <%FalseEyeD> No one told me there would Zombies in a RE game!
[3:48:21] <+Grayhammatter> zombies? in my resident evil game?
[3:48:26] <RoyallyFlushed> "I can't believe this dead enemies I have never fought are actually alive"
[3:48:28] <$RealThiele> only plants, dogs, crows, and spiders in my resident evil
[3:48:29] <+StooEsq> Do all the "scares" have the same music, or is it just me?
[3:48:34] <%Darren716> What exactly went wrong between 3 and this? Did they have a different team or something?
[3:48:36] <biomegabear> Umbrella Corp
[3:48:36] <%Darren716> ORC?
[3:48:36] <%CalderGaming> @AngriestPat what was Chris's best showing in the franchise, in your opinion?
[3:48:41] <+CarlosEoM> ORC?
[3:48:42] <Pseudonymity> operation racoon city tho
[3:48:44] <@commanderclaw> How's the DS remake of 1?
[3:48:49] <majima666> ya know considering the tech, i think i can give gaiden a pass
[3:48:49] <%Aydarkzero> Orc was just weird
[3:48:51] <%Kegeto> dead aim
[3:48:52] <+PalmtopNami> they can barely even be considered games
[3:48:53] <biomegabear> Its liked a 4 way tie
[3:48:56] <%Aydarkzero> it wasn't the worst
[3:48:59] <%jillvxlentine> @commanderclaw very good!
[3:49:00] <+machshop> the DS remake was cool it had the knife thing
[3:49:00] <%FalseEyeD> Dead Aim is RE 3.5
[3:49:02] <MSN04_Sazabi> Umbrella Corps
[3:49:03] <djazo> ORC multiplayer is great
[3:49:04] <+Javaa01> I mean, Umbrella Corps doesn't even really have a single player, it's just deathmatching with no-one
[3:49:05] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You played RE: Project REsistance yet?
[3:49:06] <%Shadowpint> Gun Survivor 2 is even worse graphically than actual CV
[3:49:07] <EddieBrock> It has better character models.
[3:49:12] <%happyface699> THERE IS AMMO IN THE LOCKER @angriestpat

[3:50:28] <%senordingdong2> Okay, even though the existence of zombies is undoubtedly unrealistic, the premise of dead bodies with negligible core temperatures having any ability to move in below-40 degree weather is just fucking dumb

[4:00:54] <djazo> it.s
[4:00:56] <Graxe_> It's a weird programming thing where the death noise doesn't play if you kill them in certain ways.
[4:00:57] <Grennold> CV is designed to fuck you over LuL
[4:00:57] <ScreamLord> Where's Paige?

[4:01:10] <+worthwhile_off> @BurdRightsActivist That is legit the funniest stream i've ever watched
[4:01:12] <natebud> At the start of the first stream someone said this game was better than 2 and 3
[4:01:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Storm_Samurai He gets way angrier
[4:01:16] <Graxe_> Usually they do make the noise, but sometimes they don't.
[4:01:19] <+StooEsq> For all the reused sounds, it's funny that there's no Hunter death sounds in CV
[4:01:22] <Scatter0> pat is having the time of his life

[4:01:45] <Graxe_> They do have death sounds. We've heard them. Just not all the time.
[4:01:53] <FG_Leo106> CV was designed to piss people off LOL
[4:01:55] <Graxe_> Which for Hunters is the worst part
[4:01:57] <%Aydarkzero> i wish the remake save room theme was longer tripleBT
[4:02:02] <+Bipolarhernandez> HIT THE LEVER

[4:02:17] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat A hunter without a deathscream reminds me of fucked people who cut their pitbull's vocal cords so they can't growl / bark, and are just surprise attack people. :(

[4:03:33] <%happyface699> Save room should be inviting and refreshing as soon as you walk in. You shouldn’t have to do a stupid puzzle for the lights to turn on.

[4:10:06] <Graxe_> "There's this old ant virus I found in a queen ant. Fused it with the T-Virus."
[4:10:07] <%logoth_> Is this how Woolie got poisoned by killer ants?
[4:10:08] <NBD_Rab> ants are way cooler than leeches, screw that leech guy

[4:10:27] <Ahk_90> "A gas formed inside its body" It's fart gas, isn't it?
[4:10:28] <%senordingdong2> 99% of the RE universe is non-main characters, which means it's all just people horribly dying with a few dozen genuine survivors who keep fighting among themselves over stupid shit like manbearpig zombies
[4:10:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ants is better than Bugs Life

[4:10:50] <RC_S3kshun8> @NBD_Rab I mean. I wouldn't want to screw the leech guy. Seems like your dick would get sucked off in all the wrong ways
[4:10:53] <%JJCheeker> Why not a serum for aaaaaaaaaiiids prerecRich
[4:10:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Rolandknight Either he wants it to be over or this is the most fun I've seen Pat have with a game in ages.
[4:10:54] <%jillvxlentine> this room is optional pat
[4:10:55] <$RealThiele> brown and dark or icy and dark rooms
[4:10:55] <%Darren716> Remember Pat, you chose to play CVX
[4:10:55] <%FalseEyeD> Love this lighter effect
[4:10:56] <tiaramaki> I wasn't here when Pat fought him, did Claire get poisoned by the boss?
[4:10:59] <KaijuVania> @Pookiedaexzile you are not wrong
[4:11:04] <%FalseEyeD> This Lighter Effect WAS AMAZING
[4:11:05] <natebud> For your modified enchanced modified pistol

[4:11:27] <%logoth_> This is so dumb
[4:11:28] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Are you SURE that RE6 is worse than CVX?
[4:11:33] <$RealThiele> ants say stay away from our queen dick virus
[4:11:33] <djazo> QUICK SUCC THE POISON OUT OF HER
[4:11:35] <natebud> Holding a lighter in the shower

[4:11:46] <%FalseEyeD> I volunteer to suck
[4:11:52] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ScreamLord he said he'd rather be playing RE6 now, and places CVX below it about an hour ago.
[4:11:52] <%JJCheeker> Suck the poison out of her box
[4:11:53] <$RealThiele> WEAR THE SUIT CHRIS
[4:11:56] <%D3rrtyD4n> smelmo apatGib
[4:12:01] <%jillvxlentine> its a special type of poison thats resistant to blue herbs
[4:12:02] <%Aydarkzero> this room looks familiar...

[4:12:09] <%QuietusPlays> bruh just reach up and grab it
[4:12:10] <%Aydarkzero> but i just can't put my finger on it
[4:12:16] <%senordingdong2> I'd suckthe poison out of Claire's box any day
[4:12:20] <+Roundelay11> would you say this is your least fav RE?
[4:12:21] <ScreamLord> @FirearmsInstructor LUL guys I missed that bit
[4:12:21] <%FalseEyeD> @Aydarkzero You're imagining things Kappa

[4:12:33] <%D3rrtyD4n> low effort puzzles atpRtsd
[4:12:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Chris Can punch Boulders
[4:12:34] <%Laecerelius> Knock it down with your huge muscles Chris!
[4:12:36] <%ospreyworks> I remember a movie reviewer saying you can tell a script is weak by the number of times characters say each other’s names.
[4:12:38] <trianglehat> when were they believableM?
[4:12:38] <majima666> i mean i like this games story because of how bat shit stupid it is, but the game itself....meh
[4:12:39] <artoflec> RE has always been about totally realistic puzzles
[4:12:39] <+Estuko> ??? YOU COULD'VE JUST CLIMBED AND GRABBED IT
[4:12:42] <%croxeye> who would put the map in there lmao
[4:12:42] <%spongeofmystery> Yawn had to bite through the floor
[4:12:42] <%FalseEyeD> Most RE puzzles... Aren't really...
[4:12:43] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat what's your all time favorite RE puzzle?
[4:12:44] <+chaumiester> Apparently, a step ladder did not exist
[4:12:46] <anAngryHamster> this is the worst box pushing noise ever
[4:12:47] <%Aydarkzero> chat i know i've seen that room from somewhere else Kappa
[4:12:47] <$RealThiele> contractor making subfloor puzzles
[4:12:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ScreamLord notkohSip
[4:12:55] <%Frostydough1> Nah as soon as items start to stack that breaks my immersion
[4:12:58] <RoyallyFlushed> >implying CVX had even mildly believable puzzles to begin with
[4:13:00] <RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat Now could you Pat, could you really?
[4:13:00] <%chiluzza> you dont even need to climb just reach up
[4:13:01] <natebud> No lighter effect in this room though
[4:13:03] <%happyface699> @aydarkzero No your crazy what are you talking about
[4:13:07] <FG_Leo106> You can use the square valve now
[4:13:09] <$RealThiele> just punch a wall and hit the switch in it ez
[4:13:09] <%JJCheeker> All of these call backs is making me think of better Resident Evil games
[4:13:10] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat white guys can;t jump
[4:13:12] <oniwahoo> Nah
[4:13:13] <rytisone> Chris wants to start training by pushing things
[4:13:14] <%Aydarkzero> yeah you all are probably right
[4:13:15] <%Gogetta159> lol is any RE puzzle "believable"?
[4:13:15] <tiaramaki> Just knock the sculpture over. It could be Chris' training for boulder-punching
[4:13:16] <%AdmiralHats> Chris can’t jump, never learned how
[4:13:17] <%jillvxlentine> the valve
[4:13:18] <%Kegeto> that why i said magic
[4:13:23] <%jillvxlentine> steve battle game
[4:13:23] <person181> to have it
[4:13:26] <%FalseEyeD> Jumping is for the weak
[4:13:26] <%D3rrtyD4n> its an unlockable for something?
[4:13:26] <Graxe_> Unlocks Steve in Battle Mode
[4:13:27] <oniwahoo> @tearonex I was just gonna make that joke lol
[4:13:28] <biomegabear> ?
[4:13:30] <%Gogetta159> To unlock steve in battle mode
[4:13:31] <%trekkie11041> unlocks steve for the battle game
[4:13:31] <RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat I think it was placed in something else
[4:13:33] <FG_Leo106> Luger unlocks Steve in Battle mode
[4:13:35] <djazo> @angriestpat a lit of thing in the RE universe could be solved by climbing or jumping LUL
[4:13:37] <%croxeye> time to get valve?
[4:13:37] <biomegabear> FUCK OFF
[4:13:38] <Graxe_> That drawer puzzle can be skipped entirely
[4:13:38] <+captain_history> The puzzles only made a bit of sense in RE1.
[4:13:39] <djazo> lot
[4:13:39] <FG_Leo106> yes
[4:13:39] <%D3rrtyD4n> ye
[4:13:41] <$RealThiele> chris traded jump perk for
[4:13:42] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat All that luger does for you is unlock 'Steve' in the battle game. It serves no purpose in the game itself so just put it away.
[4:13:42] <%happyface699> @aydarkzero Silent hill 4 maybe
[4:13:43] <MSN04_Sazabi> That's negative value
[4:13:43] <biomegabear> thats sucks
[4:13:44] <%rickyjones47> For Pats sake and sanity i cant wait for him to play RE 4
[4:13:45] <worldbrand> in what mode
[4:13:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> We wanted some Nazi shit in the game to keep it Japanese
[4:13:46] <$RealThiele> BOULDER PUNCH
[4:13:48] <%Tracazoid> An anti-reward
[4:13:48] <%Aydarkzero> wait why would it be an actual item in game
[4:13:50] <xanderfist> pat no like this game
[4:13:50] <%D3rrtyD4n> just like steve, stupid as shit
[4:13:55] <majima666> this game has pretty shitty unlockables too
[4:13:57] <%FirearmsInstructor> @MSN04_Sazabi LUL
[4:13:57] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Does that fuck that designed the Spensor Estate just build EVERYTHING related to evil BioEngineering?
[4:13:59] <%Aydarkzero> and not a collectible?
[4:13:59] <%Nina96> idk if i hate this game or it just makes me sad
[4:14:02] <%FalseEyeD> The last unlock you would ever want
[4:14:07] <oyyzzo> steve is da bomb
[4:14:08] <FG_Leo106> Its unnecesary just like Steve is
[4:14:10] <ScreamLord> *did
[4:14:13] <majima666> not even bonus costumes or anything. just a shitty first person mode
[4:14:15] <Grennold> More Steve PogChamp
[4:14:20] <%FalseEyeD> Can we RELOCK Steve?
[4:14:21] <%happyface699> WHAT FUCK THIs GAME EVEN MORE
[4:14:23] <%Aydarkzero> FPS mode Pog
[4:14:26] <natebud> You have to play at least one round of extra battle, it is unbelievable how terrible it is.
[4:14:27] <%FirearmsInstructor> @FalseEyeD LUL
[4:14:32] <%StaceMcGate> I'm getting the idea that there are no Steve stans in chat
[4:14:35] <%JJCheeker> Elmo is keeping you sane
[4:14:36] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> TrevyWeaponsGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[4:14:42] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> What a good kitty
[4:14:44] <%Ion_Laser> apatWink
[4:14:48] <ScreamLord> Elmo makes this slog-fest bearable.
[4:14:53] <%happyface699> @stacemcgate You go try and kiss a sleeping girl
[4:14:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> I think Elmo was unconscious and Pat just picked him up and gave him whiplash LUL
[4:14:55] <%Voidwyvern> Voidwyvern subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! I remember thinking CVX was a good game back when I first played it as a kid, but I struggled on the final boss so hard. Pet the baby to power you for the rest of this game
[4:14:56] <%Aydarkzero> Elmo once again keeps Pat sane
[4:14:57] <MSN04_Sazabi> Honestly Pat watching all the cutscenes on Youtube would be better than this, but then CV apologists wouldn't shut up about how the game is actually great LUL
[4:15:04] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> sugoiPunk sugoiPunk sugoiPunk

[4:15:14] <RC_S3kshun8> I mean I liked CVX
[4:15:17] <%StaceMcGate> @happyface699 I missed that, he tried to kiss Claire when he was asleep?
[4:15:24] <%happyface699> @stacemcgate Yep
[4:15:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> What if every time a bug bit you you had to throw your head back and moan
[4:15:24] <+sir_austinism> Chris getting hurt by Ants sounds like a lil car horn
[4:15:24] <%jillvxlentine> AA, CROWN, HEART, SPADE
[4:15:27] <FG_Leo106> AA- Crown - Heart - Spade
[4:15:29] <%Gogetta159> Sometimes I wonder how many ppl in chat have actually played this or if their opinion is just based on Pat's
[4:15:32] <FG_Leo106> yeah
[4:15:35] <%JJCheeker> I love it when alexia feeds me

[4:16:33] <%Tearonex> you didi it
[4:16:35] <Abok6> @Gogetta159 I played the HD version on PS3 when it came out in like 2011-2012 and I was bored to tears. To this day I can't believe that I managed to beat it

[4:16:55] <%Nina96> Chris x Boulder-chan is a unhealthy relationship

[4:17:27] <%CollinsOfBodom> the alfred
[4:17:30] <Graxe_> Yeah, Alexia shoved him in her old tube
[4:17:31] <+chaumiester> Did she grow into her clothes? How was she in there for 15 years with clothes that fit her?
[4:17:32] <%JJCheeker> I can't live without my prerecRich
[4:17:34] <Fujiwara_92> THE OL DICK TWIST
[4:17:36] <%StaceMcGate> Is Alfred british? Where exactly is he from?
[4:17:40] <%Aydarkzero> he should have laughed one last time as you left the room
[4:17:41] <%FalseEyeD> @JJCheeker Worth it
[4:17:43] <$joylent_blue> that voice pat did just now made me think of potion seller
[4:17:43] <RC_S3kshun8> @chaumiester I dont think she aged
[4:17:45] <natebud> If it makes chat feel better, Alfed never got any.
[4:17:47] <%JJCheeker> It is worth it
[4:17:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> @SocialMisfitGamer I've never played it either. :)
[4:17:54] <%Aydarkzero> @AngriestPat thank you Pat
[4:17:55] <%AdmiralHats> Stole Alfreds Juul
[4:17:58] <%D3rrtyD4n> @JJCheeker you can still sub to that channel?
[4:17:59] <%trekkie11041> @chaumiester she was naked
[4:18:01] <%Gogetta159> @D3rrtyD4n I mean I don't like the game that much, but its something I think about when a streamer goes "this game sucks" and chat just agrees
[4:18:05] <%Nina96> @AngriestPat how far are u through this right now?
[4:18:06] <+StooEsq> Here lies Alfred. He never scored.
[4:18:09] <djazo> @gogetta159 this game fucked my save it the final boss so i had to play it all over again and it sucked twice
[4:18:11] <%spongeofmystery> Has anyone ever cosplayed Alfred cosplaying as Alexia?
[4:18:11] <ScreamLord> @chaumiester Bio-Knitting
[4:18:12] <%dukenux> my opinion is based on how this game looks
[4:18:20] <Graxe_> But Chris is like, "Eh,"
[4:18:24] <Graxe_> Just another room
[4:18:26] <FG_Leo106> Save just in case Pat haha
[4:18:30] <%JJCheeker> I guess so I still sub
[4:18:33] <$RealThiele> chris is too busy looking for claire and GUN
[4:18:36] <%Aydarkzero> Chris is only interested in dealing with Wesker and his hate boner
[4:18:40] <%ospreyworks> Also, how does Claire know who Wesker is?
[4:18:42] <+captain_history> this game is a lot of wasted ideas
[4:18:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> Chris Who can punch boulders, should have more of a recaction
[4:18:46] <%Laecerelius> You can’t understand the fucks Chris doesn’t give
[4:18:48] <SixthSun2> You assuming Chris recognizes it is funny, since we know now he's the big musclehead he is
[4:18:54] <MSN04_Sazabi> Claire saw the script
[4:18:56] <RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat How long after Raccoon got nuked does this take place? I notice Chris is wearing his old STARS fatigues and web gear
[4:19:00] <%rickyjones47> You can do it Pat!
[4:19:02] <%Aydarkzero> @ospreyworks i always figured Claire would have met all the Stars members at some point
[4:19:02] <+StooEsq> At least you get a bit of that "this shit again" in Lost in Nightmares for RE5
[4:19:02] <%ospreyworks> Like, she knows him pretty much on sight.
[4:19:03] <%jillvxlentine> yeah it goes in the main hall
[4:19:06] <Fujiwara_92> Chris only want two things, to fuck Wesker and to get Leon to fuck Claire
[4:19:07] <+chaumiester> I don't understand how any of the RE character at this current point and time just don't always have a gun on them at all points and times
[4:19:09] <%dukenux> i watched pat plays other REs that Pat played and they didnt look as bad ad this one
[4:19:10] <oniwahoo> Chris is here to find Claire and take her to Leon
[4:19:13] <%trekkie11041> @RC_S3kshun8 like 3 months
[4:19:19] <rytisone> Wesker is Chris's old partner, you know
[4:19:21] <natebud> It's a popular statue, they probably sell them at garden centers.
[4:19:25] <flyingtentaclemonster> wtf there is a Chris campaign in this game?
[4:19:31] <$RealThiele> this is what, after 2, but before 3 then?

[4:19:49] <djazo> @angriestpat you know what chris is better then Clair in this game cause there is no steve
[4:19:49] <%dukenux> this is after 3
[4:19:50] <natebud> One would wonder why they put two right next to each other
[4:19:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Weskers been a naughty officer and only his best partner can bring him in
[4:19:51] <%Aydarkzero> @RealThiele three months after the event of two and three
[4:19:55] <+chaumiester> You think RE8 is gonna be Rebecca Chambers?

[4:31:57] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you can put the shotgun on the hooks and the picture by the door raises revealing some Flame rounds and some Normal rounds for your GL
[4:32:02] <%trueherobappo> So, I'm still hoping for Kiryu for Tekken. anyone else?
[4:32:03] <%jillvxlentine> you need health to run away from steve
[4:32:10] <djazo> @luftraumm1 RE was never serious LUL
[4:32:12] <Doomguy137> why was there only six bullets in a big ass case
[4:32:26] <%Psych_man13_13> So did I miss the explanation of what T-Veronica does?
[4:32:27] <%FalseEyeD> Reminds me of the Berserk DC game
[4:32:36] <%jillvxlentine> AT LEAST 2
[4:32:36] <%TheSphereHunter> go put the bowgun back
[4:32:44] <%Basch71> she's the only case that healing is required for that bit
[4:32:48] <%TheSphereHunter> chris can kill the final boss quick ith the fire bolts

[4:52:00] <%Valdorick> Biohazard™ Key
[4:52:01] <dredshift> Shouldn't those be called Resident Evil doors in the US version
[4:52:04] <faithless_zealot> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, g'evening
[4:52:05] <%Aydarkzero> wait what
[4:52:06] <%dukenux> Veronica was the friends we made on the way
[4:52:09] <%JJCheeker> You must save
[4:52:10] <%FalseEyeD> How we all doing GAMERS?!
[4:52:10] <oyyzzo> my gamer fluids are a biohazard
[4:52:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> It's the sex-press bed!!
[4:52:15] <%OldOnyx> Think events here are only lightly hinted at in Rev 2 (which is an actually decent game) but thats about it
[4:52:16] <%Skittlesoul> you should save
[4:52:16] <MSN04_Sazabi> We truly were the Biohazard: Code Veronica
[4:52:18] <TioXyco> wow, pat is going strong with code veronica
[4:52:22] <RavenHellkite> just a reminder that this was gonna be RE3 LUL
[4:52:23] <Manjove> Rev1 Jill is best Jill, fight me
[4:52:26] <%FalseEyeD> Getting your GAME on I hope!
[4:52:26] <%AdmiralHats> What are behind the biohazard doors? @angriestpat
[4:52:28] <%Valdorick> Theme of incest.
[4:52:28] <%Aydarkzero> weren't we just in antartica?
[4:52:28] <Mishal21S> They’re just shitting on the game too much
[4:52:30] <SleepyMaribo> why wouldnt you put all your biohazrd stuff in one spot, why is the architect so fucking dumb?
[4:52:32] <+yay_waffles> that thing is too big shut up
[4:52:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why can't you just break open one of these locks?
[4:52:39] <%barkon345> So was RE3 the only one of the fixed camera RE games that only let you play as 1 character?
[4:52:41] <+jj92> im really glad this wasnt re3.....thank fuck
[4:52:47] <%FalseEyeD> "This part"
[4:52:49] <%JJCheeker> This part does
[4:52:59] <Vitoria90> RE3 still has the part where you play as Carlos
[4:53:02] <oyyzzo> every part has been a banger
[4:53:02] <%VashyronM> This part sucks as opposed to?
[4:53:02] <Fujiwara_92> just this part 4Head
[4:53:02] <biomegabear> What part didnt suck?
[4:53:05] <+ecolli37108> Pat youve said that about the whole game.
[4:53:06] <%Aydarkzero> @AngriestPat you can just say the whole game
[4:53:07] <%jillvxlentine> the only biohazard room is the one downstairs
[4:53:13] <%trekkie11041> why isnt he saving after what we just did oh my god
[4:53:14] <+HouseofNonsense> The Ashfords seem like a bunch of fucking dumbasses.
[4:53:15] <+RowenCleric> man the last boss in this is even worse
[4:53:17] <+buffn99> @barkon345 You play as Carlos
[4:53:18] <djazo> @mishal21s I wonder why LUL
[4:53:21] <%FalseEyeD> Dog it in a tweet again
[4:53:21] <ScreamLord> Pat is slowly fading away
[4:53:28] <lautalocos> i just tuned in, why does pat look like he is about to die?
[4:53:30] <%dukenux> RE3 lets you play as Carlos, albeit for a short time
[4:53:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> I really want a RE game where you see some doors with a key you can't get....then you get a sledgehammer or something and just bust them down
[4:53:37] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> THIS GAME IS SOOOOO GOOOD
[4:53:39] <%coldinnovation> hows it hanging gang
[4:53:42] <%jillvxlentine> now you gotta go back to the previous save room and turn off the power
[4:53:43] <%Jeemukun> 743`;l;
[4:53:44] <Vitoria90> this game a shit
[4:53:44] <FG_Leo106> Final "Puzzle" incoming
[4:53:46] <Goldteddy> Its the room, that says BIOHAZARD when you enter
[4:53:48] <%Valdorick> Wait wait wait... I had just woken up when I turned the stream on, and on a stupid moment to... Did Steve overpower a FUCKING ZOMBIE VIRUS through the power of BONER!?
[4:53:49] <%FalseEyeD> Short, shriveled, and to the left
[4:53:50] <%barkon345> yea but you dont get to chose to play as him for the whole game
[4:53:51] <%jillvxlentine> you gotta turn off the power pat
[4:53:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> This game will make you Sterile
[4:53:52] <SixthSun2> That feels like something that would have been changed in localization cuz of the Japanese name of the series
[4:53:54] <Fujiwara_92> how dumber can this game get LUL
[4:53:56] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat put back, turn off power
[4:53:57] <+yay_waffles> I mean this is Biohazard Code Veronica right
[4:53:58] <%Jeemukun> +
[4:53:58] <+DRAGKUDO> So why was this seen as the best resident evil?
[4:54:01] <+Rand0mselect> oh yeah the dumb power LUL
[4:54:02] <%coldinnovation> Yes the power of love saved steve
[4:54:03] <%jillvxlentine> in the save room
[4:54:03] <%ospreyworks> Claire’s been alone with Steve’s body for awhile now...
[4:54:05] <HorribleHog> Well, not every resident evil game has to have a lab... but if they do they could name it something other than "sterile room"
[4:54:06] <%Aydarkzero> FeelsBadMan
[4:54:06] <fairore> @lautalocos playing veronica will do that to you
[4:54:08] <%jillvxlentine> the dark save room
[4:54:14] <Mishal21S> @djazo There are some negatives but it’s still a decent game and I love it bawkGlad
[4:54:15] <Arweynn> So, did they make this as RE3, saw how horribly it sucked, pushed out Nemesis with the RE3 tag, then went through and added the fixes like infinite blue herb and boss retry before letting it out?
[4:54:18] <KaijuVania> HOW much more of this game is there?????
[4:54:21] <Manjove> this game is killing us all
[4:54:24] <%trekkie11041> THE SAVE ROOM PAT
[4:54:31] <FG_Leo106> i remembee getting stuck here my first time playing it lol
[4:54:35] <+Rand0mselect> I dont hate CVX but its pretty dull overall
[4:54:37] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @KaijuVania yes
[4:54:38] <Goldteddy> Wait does everything in the mansion use gems and sockets to run?
[4:54:38] <Mishal21S> This is just not fair
[4:54:39] <%barkon345> @DRAGKUDO who in gods name ever said this was the best resident evil game?
[4:54:40] <FG_Leo106> remember*
[4:54:45] <ScreamLord> And for some reason you can't just remove both at the same time with your TWO hands?
[4:54:47] <Manjove> i did
[4:54:47] <%asgard147> This game really needs a remake, it could be so much better. limesFeels
[4:54:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Finish us Pat! Pleeeaase...
[4:54:51] <%FalseEyeD> Thank Christ
[4:54:52] <+RowenCleric> this game is killing Pat and Dirge of Cerberus drained Max's soul
[4:54:57] <%FacetiousAF> its almost over?!
[4:54:57] <%Alexisonfires> The save room with the power generator in that cold ass zig zag corridor
[4:55:00] <%FalseEyeD> Time to Climax us

[4:55:11] <RavenHellkite> i want dino crisis remake before this game gets one
[4:55:13] <jeffthesequel> Man it feels like your taking damage from this game.
[4:55:14] <%spongeofmystery> What's the final code, Pat?
[4:55:16] <Fujiwara_92> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeye we finish this shit tonight bois PogChamp
[4:55:24] <%FacetiousAF> sweet jesus pat will get his freedom apatGib
[4:55:24] <+Rand0mselect> I want Steve to be exactly the same if they remake this
[4:55:25] <TonberryCrunch> can a remake even save this?
[4:55:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Honestly Pat just give the game its fair shot and I'm sure you'll see its underrated
[4:55:31] <FG_Leo106> maybe
[4:55:34] <%barkon345> that goes to either RE4 or RE1 depending on your preference
[4:55:39] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat how many times have you beaten this game?
[4:55:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Coward
[4:55:51] <fairore> @rand0mselect but why good sir
[4:55:52] <FG_Leo106> if they replace 90% of the areas with new ones
[4:55:57] <biomegabear> wanna bring the sub machine guns for the final boss?
[4:55:57] <%Pukenasty> fire em now
[4:56:00] <+lilgarbage_> Our work here is done- Mind Goblins

[4:56:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> BOW GUN
[4:56:07] <%Psych_man13_13> After seeing you play this, I no longer want a CVX remake
[4:56:13] <%FalseEyeD> BOW GUN
[4:56:14] <%jillvxlentine> the other side
[4:56:16] <trulythedude> you better be sorry you drocklick
[4:56:17] <djazo> @pookiedaexzile this is a fair shot LUL
[4:56:19] <Fujiwara_92> what are you looking for?
[4:56:22] <%jillvxlentine> yeah there
[4:56:25] <biomegabear> bow gun
[4:56:26] <%Psych_man13_13> Just forget it even exists
[4:56:28] <%rickyjones47> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw pretty sure he said 3 times at the start of the stream. but the last time was in 2008
[4:56:34] <Nightweaver20xx> Nobody needs Valve anymore
[4:56:36] <+Rand0mselect> @fairore hes so good LUL
[4:56:37] <%ospreyworks> @djazo i think they were being sarcastic
[4:56:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Nightweaver20xx but they keep steam going
[4:56:58] <%FalseEyeD> Fire Arrows baby
[4:57:01] <biomegabear> @Nightweaver20xx did you see valvue announce they're not making Left 4 dead 3
[4:57:03] <Fujiwara_92> don't forget the shotty
[4:57:04] <FG_Leo106> Instead of remaking CVX, just make a new game with Claire and someone else as protagonists using the RE2 and RE3R formula
[4:57:05] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Equip gun
[4:57:08] <%jillvxlentine> i dont think you have anything equipped
[4:57:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> What the FUCK are they even writing on these typewriters?!
[4:57:25] <%FalseEyeD> @doc_ock_rokc Shhhhhh, just go with it
[4:57:26] <%ospreyworks> All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[4:57:34] <oyyzzo> big ol problem solving
[4:57:41] <djazo> @ospreyworks it.s to risky to not use kappa
[4:57:41] <%jillvxlentine> fml
[4:57:42] <faronmcsalty> i like to imagine the characters are writing out real dry dialogue about their adventures on the typewriters
[4:57:42] <RavenHellkite> put claire in dino crisis that's the remake
[4:57:42] <+Outlaw451> i sure can
[4:57:45] <trulythedude> Ivan bronchoesky loser
[4:57:47] <+Ryallen> What do the dragonfly wings do
[4:57:47] <%Taisuru> Alexia! Her teeth are big and green! Alexia, she smells like gas-o-line!
[4:57:59] <+yay_waffles> now thats what we need dino crisis remakes
[4:58:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> To the Chris of the next time loop. This is everything I did! Heart Chris
[4:58:03] <%cowardman93> I get in from work and Pat has somehow forced himself back to CVX
[4:58:08] <%cowardman93> proud
[4:58:13] <%jillvxlentine> they look like candies
[4:58:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> Don't compare this game to asssucking, someone might enjoy ass sucking
[4:58:22] <TioXyco> but what if they fix it?
[4:58:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> DC 1, 2 or 3?
[4:58:23] <Vitoria90> I imagine a remake of this would be significantly different

[5:05:14] <%barkon345> @AngriestPat are you going to play Devil May Cry and Haunting Ground as they were both supposed to be Resident evil 4?

[5:17:01] <+AXL808> the eye would just grow back anyway
[5:17:01] <%Aydarkzero> wait he was suppose to lose an eye? that would have looked really cool

[5:17:06] <%DetroitSentai> why not just give him a virus eye with an eyepatch reveal
[5:17:07] <KaliasTV> In resident evil you can only gain eyes
[5:17:11] <%Valdorick> It really wouldn't make sense if BEAMS OF STEEL didn't remove a eye, but then a flaccid fire did.
[5:17:14] <eldritchmoeblob> SUPER EYEPATCH WESKER would be sick

[5:19:22] <olaksi> they should be all hiding in a hole somewhere after that
[5:19:23] <+Tswoooh23> Louis
[5:19:23] <%Gogetta159> Blame RE4 for that
[5:19:25] <rytisone> so yesterday was 25%?
[5:19:28] <%TomDanksEGOT> you could argue the first 3 games were what exposed their evil doing to the president and UN for them to actually act
[5:19:31] <jinking79> then NeoUnbrella happens
[5:19:31] <Nightweaver20xx> Which it did.
[5:19:31] <+Tswoooh23> CK
[5:19:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Breakdown Breakdown
[5:19:38] <+AXL808> that's how you know it's fiction, real companies are stronger than the government
[5:19:39] <biomegabear> Satoshi you suck
[5:19:39] <oniwahoo> How would it not have happened like right After Raccoon City?
[5:19:41] <%AmericanaRed> thanks bush SeemsGood
[5:19:42] <%ospreyworks> And then the cool idea with Tricell dies after one game
[5:19:45] <Ahk_90> The magic of videogames, in which a government ACTS on Evil Corporations
[5:19:47] <%LaughingCatt> That wouldve happened within hours
[5:19:48] <Meekest> That's the USA for you Pat
[5:19:51] <zamzoph> it was clearly an accident
[5:19:51] <Manjove> that would have been next day
[5:19:52] <Asuxley> zombie money
[5:19:53] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat In reality it wouldve taken 3 years
[5:19:54] <%Aydarkzero> That's How America works Kappa
[5:19:55] <%D3rrtyD4n> moon2SHRUG
[5:19:57] <eldritchmoeblob> i feel like if the US nuked one of its own cities the geopolitics of the RE earth would be absolutely jacked up
[5:19:57] <%dukenux> i mean, bureaucracy
[5:19:58] <%cowardman93> I'm fairly certain that piece of paper gets signed BEFORE the nuke gets launched
[5:19:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat ☼ YOU ☼ DID ☼ IT ☼
[5:19:58] <biomegabear> that would get fillibutsered hard
[5:19:59] <$ggbhtg> NA LUL
[5:19:59] <%chiluzza> it would have been fucking approved literally 3 seconds after that happened
[5:20:01] <%ospreyworks> Gets built up in Degeneration
[5:20:03] <Grennold> They are though LuL
[5:20:03] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean...given how stupid people are today? Yeah I'd believe it'd take even longer.
[5:20:05] <Meekest> No Pat that's just how long it takes for bureaucracy in America
[5:20:06] <SixthSun2> Eh, 3 months seems like a reasonable amount of time to gather sufficent evidence
[5:20:06] <%Dementedpenguin> Thanks for taking the time to beat this, Pat. Like really. It looked painful.
[5:20:09] <outis94> Our bureaucracy is kinda Bullshit pat
[5:20:09] <Nightweaver20xx> Time is convoluted.
[5:20:10] <%GunEden> paperwork usually takes years
[5:20:12] <ittla> welcome to bureaucracy
[5:20:12] <Stillchr> I think they are going after the remnants that refuse to stop working
[5:20:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> did you know Both Donald Trump and Bill Clinton took multiple Trips To jeffery Episteins Island, Little Saint James
[5:20:15] <%Psych_man13_13> No but we gotta kill Spencer
[5:20:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> WELL the nuke did fucking wipe out most evidence
[5:20:17] <$ggbhtg> NA LAW LUL
[5:20:18] <+MajorCrasher> honestly yeah, American government is slow as shit

[5:20:22] <pixelandarilho> politics as its finest
[5:20:22] <natebud> Claire was looking for Chris even though Leon just knew where he was and emailed him
[5:20:23] <%jillvxlentine> maybe by umbrella chris means wesker personally
[5:20:24] <%FalseEyeD> Patriot Act went by Hella Quick
[5:20:24] <+RowenCleric> I mean... America's government is known for being fast and effective, totally...
[5:20:25] <%barkon345> the part that breaks down is that the government would never shut down a giant corporation especially if it was evil.
[5:20:26] <%D3rrtyD4n> president zombo
[5:20:26] <Kristoffers> SMART
[5:20:26] <%TheSphereHunter> Mikami literally said during RE4's development FUCK THE STORY

[5:20:36] <+davejales> RE6 IS A GOOD GAME, THERE I SAID IT
[5:20:37] <%cowardman93> I feel like RE4 kind of tried to remove CVX from existence
[5:20:37] <JxsFusion> Umbrella Chronicles has the true end to Umbrella
[5:20:39] <rytisone> Dont forget a mission in Umbrella Chronicles
[5:20:41] <%Aydarkzero> Resident Evil has a Story?

[5:23:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITs so sad pat finished his FAVORITE RE GAME right now
[5:23:34] <%ospreyworks> RE6 also has Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey. That bumps it up by a point at least.
[5:23:36] <%FalseEyeD> Katoh never directed another game

[5:23:39] <natebud> @Mishal21S You are wrong though
[5:23:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @FG_Leo106 Not even close to true. Infact, Steve was deliberately changed to look more like Leon in CVX since everyone hated him in CV...
