[0:31:21] <Jarvanii> a panic button for porn?
[0:31:21] <+AngriestAngryArtist> @AngriestPat Vesa Mount is a mount especially made for monitors that has 4 screw holes in the back.
[0:31:23] <dukenux> no, that's VASEline
[0:31:25] <dukenux> for the port
[0:31:26] <%Shooterboy23> UPDATE: After careful examination it has been confirmed that yes it does in fact blow you.
[0:31:26] <TheAkex> vesa mount means you can add a new stand that can low profile

[0:41:47] <grayjammer> <message deleted>
[0:41:48] <CopperTucker> hold on
[0:41:49] <CelioHogane> BLUE MAGE, FUCK IT
[0:41:54] <%ShaneWhite> Is Paige sick again
[0:41:55] <+MisterCrimson> @Arclight2879 while I would like to agree since an anarchy would be a nice experiment, it does leave about 800,000 people without paychecks for a while.
[0:41:55] <HellboundHeartless> I like to Tank, so I started with Gladiator
[0:42:00] <%TombstoneTTromboners> yeah
[0:42:01] <%CJett92> So just go Warrior, ok?
[0:42:03] <dekkitout> except blue mage
[0:42:04] <flyinghobo> if you have no fuckin life you could do that
[0:42:05] <%BeardedLuchador> PLD is boring
[0:42:05] <Bouldus> @ShaneWhite always?
[0:42:06] <Crimpson> Wanna lvl fast? lvl WHM or Tank
[0:42:07] <mrjohncarlton> Go Play Blue Mage Kappa
[0:42:07] <%Owkono> do every job
[0:42:08] <DocMadfox> I played it for a little while as a Black Mage
[0:42:10] <@SSaryn> Beginner - Warrior, Paladin, Red Mage, White Mage, Dragoon.
[0:42:10] <dukenux> Ain't nobody got time for that!
[0:42:11] <$tsundere____> if you dont play WAR you're a babby
[0:42:14] <Kingtut9009> Does that class put the Glad in Gladiator?
[0:42:16] <CopperTucker> I went straight for Dragoon
[0:42:17] <%Gogogolem> Pick a tank class cause Mmorpgs suck your dick if you're willing to tank
[0:42:21] <%Kazooki_Kazami> unlock potd, play with a bunch of jobs
[0:42:21] <Bailey__gaming> @shanewhite she's always afflicted by big BIO
[0:42:25] <DocMadfox> My friends said they'd hang out with me, but they didn't so I fell out with the game =<
[0:42:26] <%some_sunflowers> Summoner, then you can just swap to Scholar and let your fairy heal if need a group
[0:42:26] <%Eaglestrike117> DRAGOON IS NOT SIMPLE
[0:42:27] <meatgeneral69> that’s a terrible way to do it
[0:42:27] <+MisterCrimson> Dragoon simple LUL
[0:42:30] <Crimpson> or just play BRD
[0:42:32] <Shoudesuka_mechadork> Ninja bay-beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[0:42:32] <%moogleboy1984> Paladin/Black Mage/Scholar
[0:42:33] <+BioHunter> white mag is sooooo boring
[0:42:34] <%Cavumentum> Oh hey we're 1080p now
[0:42:37] <+boomboxvillain> You got it
[0:42:37] <%mrgaster8> apatSmug apatSmug apatSmug
[0:42:38] <%Noponiz> dragoon EARLY is simple
[0:42:38] <$modelofrags> cheer280 whats the over under on re2 having a streaming embargo on it?
[0:42:38] <%ShaneWhite> Thanks guys
[0:42:39] <+BioHunter> pick sch or ast
[0:42:39] <graemecrackers1> Crazy talk
[0:42:40] <%crimsonharvest> I would recommend against pat's recommendation, play Marauder, Summoner, and Archer for easy times
[0:42:40] <HellboundHeartless> working to that Dark Knight
[0:42:41] <Maldoree> PLAY SCHOLAR YOU COWARD!
[0:42:41] <+NeonLight> Every class is easy as heck before 30
[0:42:47] <LiquidMathew> If you are scummy play dps
[0:42:48] <+BioHunter> anything other than white mage
[0:42:48] <$DavidCrimsonHeidern> No Level 30
[0:42:48] <%TheShal> BLM/AST/DRK
[0:43:01] <%BlackJack607> @AngriestPat Whata you think about them reworking Dark Knight
[0:43:01] <Bailey__gaming> I like Pats shirt! what's it from?
[0:43:02] <%BeardedLuchador> Just go DPS to learn all the content
[0:43:05] <+Thunderhawk47> The community is pretty nice so it helps to actually talk to people, unlike WoW
[0:43:07] <@SSaryn> And if you play DRK, you'll already know what your problem is Kappa
[0:43:07] <%trez_> healers adjust apatDab
[0:43:10] <%moogleboy1984> Scholar is best healer, Black Mage is best Caster, fite me
[0:43:12] <00raln00> SAM/DRK baby
[0:43:14] <+DrTomT18> hey party people,whats happening
[0:43:18] <%Owkono> pull mobs for the tank if you are a dps
[0:43:19] <$Sayie> DPS is piss easy and boring though
[0:43:19] <%thewinged7> just play lancer apatElmo
[0:43:22] <Calamity2007> I use WAR mostly
[0:43:23] <Rezroc> Easy Modes: Paladin - Ninja - Astrologian fite me
[0:43:23] <CopperTucker> Dragoon forever. Because I want edgy stupid armor.
[0:43:27] <%thewinged7> level 99 lancer
[0:43:27] <XyraFhoan> but if you play black mage, you can't backflip off ledges like a champ
[0:43:29] <HeadsHeldHigh> fools can't keep up with my BIG WAR
[0:43:31] <CopperTucker> Au Ra Dragoon on Siren, yo
[0:43:32] <Yukasmarvin> @AngriestPat I like your shirt!
[0:43:33] <Maldoree> @moogleboy1984 my man! *armbear hugs*
[0:43:35] <Bouldus> i only find tanking and healing interesting in mmos
[0:43:38] <%megamonmon123> i like magic cause im a huge coward
[0:43:39] <Bailey__gaming> oh its an EVEE shirt
[0:43:40] <DominoFrancisco> dragoon armor is just recolors of tank armor
[0:43:41] <%Kazooki_Kazami> YEYEYE
[0:43:43] <+BioHunter> get everything to 70 like i am
[0:43:43] <@SSaryn> GIVE ME DANCER YOU FUCKERS
[0:43:45] <Shoudesuka_mechadork> Ninjas because I like to whoosh like fast and stab things a lot
[0:43:47] <ScreamingMeat> S&B is the strongest weapon in Monster Hunter
[0:43:48] <Bouldus> dps is god awful boring
[0:43:50] <%TombstoneTTromboners> i haven't played ffxiv in ages
[0:43:51] <%Ilpala271> fuck combat classes, land/hand for life
[0:43:52] <Darren716> Its a yes
[0:43:52] <CopperTucker> Shou why
[0:43:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> *lip smack*
[0:43:53] <CopperTucker> Shou no
[0:43:54] <DominoFrancisco> im a dragoon main, I know the pain
[0:43:54] <%CJett92> Confirmed
[0:43:56] <%NovaKnightmare> confirmed
[0:43:56] <arcaderabbit48> Summoner is in a really weird place because it starts out super easy and you get a free healer class with it, but its endgame rotation is very specific. Not hard in a mental sense, but surprisingly taxing in a reflex sense. You're slapping as many buttons as you can every .8 seconds in a very specific time frame.
[0:43:58] <dawnengel> flogging drunken peasents
[0:43:58] <CaptainKarite> Is it still a sub game? FFXIV?
[0:43:59] <%GohanEgret> announcement of an announcement

[0:44:29] <FairyShy> does anyone remember what datacenter Pat plays on for FFXIV?
[0:44:31] <+JoshuaOneal> I just like these streams cause it's basically "Pat has gaming A.D.D." and I can relate
[0:44:31] <judgementmegaface> Hey Pat do a heat move on Skelml
[0:44:33] <%Remery_> peasants
[0:44:35] <+rubywitchd> DPS can be super fun, I mained BRD for most of 4.X not main AST
[0:44:36] <%ECRead> Dedicated healers are very close to babysitters
[0:44:38] <flyinghobo> is paige not on screen because of the black eye?
[0:44:39] <rabidmonkey32> ok
[0:44:41] <%Garthunox> Just caught up on the ME1 vod
[0:44:43] <$Sayie> Don't let retail destroy you and turn you into a cynical asshole
[0:44:44] <%CyborgAV> Pat's on Primal
[0:44:45] <%Garthunox> hoo boy
[0:44:47] <@SSaryn> MANBEAST
[0:44:48] <Bouldus> @ECRead i know :/ lol
[0:44:49] <Finakala> BRD is best
[0:44:49] <%Ilpala271> Yea I loved Summoner through Heavensward, but the Stormblood changes threw me off hard and with Red Mage RIGHT THERE I slotted into that
[0:44:53] <%sparrrow_> Pat's been apatHoldon 'ing for 45 minutes huh
[0:44:53] <%topendbuzz> MANBOST
[0:44:54] <XyraFhoan> Ultros is on Primal DC and won't get split off onto Crystal when the great DC restructuring happens

[0:45:00] <$StaleLoaf> cheer500 So, I just finished Neon Genesis Evangelion for the first time and this stream is the perfect thing to help me relax after those last 2 episodes. Thanks, Lavabeard dad.
[0:45:02] <@SSaryn> FIX MAH LANYARD, YE FUK
[0:45:04] <Bouldus> @ECRead i nearly always heal, its like looking after 3 yr olds
[0:45:04] <Djinn247> i've been away for a while, is there gameplay yet ?
[0:45:06] <arcaderabbit48> @megamonmon123 It actually kinda is? Like the sequence of buttons is really specific, but it is pretty easy to memorize. Its all about shooting off the highest possible number of spells in the smallest possible time frame.
[0:45:06] <dekkitout> You doth not know what I ith
[0:45:08] <%SaltyDongs> MAHBEAST
[0:45:11] <dukenux> Sneaksy manbeastie

[0:45:53] <b1gboss007> PLAY FES
[0:45:53] <+dyedeme> Also if you're on mobile it won't auto sync
[0:45:55] <%megamonmon123> junpei is worst boy
[0:45:56] <mr_slaide> @Shoudesuka_mechadork INDEED!
[0:45:57] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Fujiwara_92)
[0:45:57] <%thewinged7> play as a girl, get the pocket watch
[0:45:58] <%ArcanumMBD> Go into discord settings, Connections, link your twitch, wait an hour for discord to update, go back to Connections, join channel
[0:46:01] <+chief413> P5R reveal was a bit of a cock block
[0:46:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Rotate your saves
[0:46:02] <%Keyd00d> Play FES instead
[0:46:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> You can go out at night, that is SUPER important for social stats
[0:46:13] <%RaikenTB> Play as girl then lez out with Aegis and Elizabeth.
[0:46:22] <b1gboss007> Fest is way better
[0:46:22] <+cvp5127> TAKE THE DRUGS
[0:46:22] <%ECRead> @Bouldus I know the feeling lol
[0:46:23] <CptBartholomeow> Hello father

[0:46:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yikes

[0:46:28] <%MisterTylerrr> also play as female protag
[0:46:29] <%Noahccountingfortaste> oof
[0:46:32] <bendatron> also prioritize the school social links because of the school breaks
[0:46:32] <+Yokuho> God, he's still reading
[0:46:35] <%sparrrow_> Digital Devil Saga is worth playing more than Raidou imo
[0:46:35] <$StaleLoaf> I'll do it later, I'm exhausted after watching the series.
[0:46:37] <@SSaryn> Never let it set in.
[0:46:41] <briscobrongo> I didn't die and you entertained me. Thanks.
[0:46:44] <%GohanEgret> keep the faith, duder
[0:46:45] <$awsomesaucekirby> God i love my dread and depression
[0:46:46] <romanticzomedy> DDS is fantastic
[0:46:47] <ComradeConquistador> Just play 4.
[0:46:47] <that_owl_guy> Also, be ready for Mitsuru to cuck you with poorly timed Marin Karin
[0:46:47] <Bouldus> @ECRead gets you a good rep though, if you can effectively take care of the children Kappa
[0:46:48] <+ren173> so what should I play after P5. P4, P3, or the DMC Quadrilogy
[0:46:50] <Shoudesuka_mechadork> @sparrrow_ hot take: why not both?
[0:46:55] <%PenmanLupine> Pat looked at Paige when he said distraction....oh no
[0:46:58] <CopperTucker> I don't really care for FemMC's design, despite how much I wanna bone Akihiko. I haven't even decided who I'm gonna play
[0:46:58] <@SSaryn> CAPCOM would be fucking idiotic to do that as well.
[0:46:59] <arcaderabbit48> Oh my god they did!
[0:46:59] <romanticzomedy> @ren173 p3
[0:47:00] <+JoeStillLife> you!
[0:47:02] <JDRK> LUL
[0:47:02] <%TeraMercier> And Pat would burn down their headquarters for making him choose
[0:47:03] <%Keyd00d> HIM
[0:47:03] <%Garthunox> Paige will you play more ME1?
[0:47:04] <Finakala> P4 is a masterpiece @ren173
[0:47:05] <%topendbuzz> HIM!!?!?!?!
[0:47:06] <%ssjklyco> Can you contact them to have them sponsor the stream?
[0:47:06] <danknugglit> LUL
[0:47:07] <%sparrrow_> @Shoudesuka_mechadork do both, but do DDS first
[0:47:10] <+Ssaik> <--- HIM
[0:47:10] <LiquidMathew> Pat wants Leon's Jacket
[0:47:12] <%Remery_> But they heard about you PAt :)
[0:47:17] <$modelofrags> pog
[0:47:17] <emillionghost> I like you.
[0:47:17] <%GohanEgret> c ra zy talk incoming
[0:47:18] <gustavozxd> getting dmcv early PogChamp
[0:47:20] <+VVardy> Think you can get DMC5 a day early?
[0:47:21] <%BeardedLuchador> RE7 was a massive viral hit for them
[0:47:23] <%TeraMercier> Pat wants to fuck leon's jacket you mean
[0:47:24] <%Alexplosion35> Everyone wants Leon's jacket
[0:47:24] <%DarkSodaMcFaceHead> Alot has changed from Capcom pulling Darkside Chronicles LPs
[0:47:26] <%JGardner88> I see that Detroit Become Human sitting there, can we expect a Third Impact?
[0:47:30] <%Tostky> poop
[0:47:31] <Eye_of_Hades> big fluffy pat in leon's jacket is something i want to see now
[0:47:31] <%Noahccountingfortaste> is Paige still feeling big sick?
[0:47:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat instinctively rubbed his hands together just talking about REmake2
[0:47:36] <+CarlosEoM> also its a remkae what the fuck are you gonna spoil
[0:47:36] <Shoudesuka_mechadork> @sparrrow_ I mean tbf I lean more towards cyberpunk demons just automatically vs old timey nihons demons
[0:47:40] <%CJett92> Perfect
[0:47:41] <kingofasgard> skip 6, it ain't great
[0:47:41] <gustavozxd> play the original Yakuza 1 and 2 though
[0:47:42] <+JoeStillLife> jeez
[0:47:43] <%XzileGaming> Capcom has really redeemed themselves this past year
[0:47:43] <%Keyd00d> oh boy
[0:47:43] <+ilpeggiore_> yakuzi? Kowami?
[0:47:44] <%Garthunox> @jgardner88 Paige did third impact
[0:47:44] <grayjammer> Grindless
[0:47:45] <TheEnablerr> grindless
[0:47:47] <@SSaryn> Honestly, Pat, you might wanna stream the end of 5 because of what starts up in 6. That's all I'll say.
[0:47:48] <%Cavumentum> The answer is I'd let Dante fuck Leon's Jacket
[0:47:49] <DrkJP520> Capcom doesn't min getting paid in exposure

[0:57:17] <%bluemorning104> oh shit, bacchus
[0:57:18] <@SSaryn> Also totally don't hear an echo so idk.
[0:57:21] <arcaderabbit48> @Shoudesuka_mechadork The Yakuza families have their own Twitch channels, and also stream them there. There are a lot of yakuza fights in this world.
[0:57:22] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> though theyre talking quieter now I guess
[0:57:23] <alexandrecau> gold star
[0:57:30] <kingofasgard> that'd take work
[0:57:31] <%TheShal> Are there fucking posters of Baccus on the walls OF BACCUS!?
[0:57:36] <Bouldus> Majima sneaking round filming hype footage of Kiryu, sounds about right
[0:57:42] <HeadsHeldHigh> BibleThump
[0:57:43] <TranquilTurnip> Crime is a form of business there
[0:57:44] <Darren716> Well isnt homicide always the top?
[0:57:44] <%sparrrow_> Homicide is always the top Pat
[0:57:45] <CheekyBirb> @RollCritFail isn't this whole game just a slow version of that whole sequence? Kappa
[0:57:45] <TheBigO75> because money
[0:57:47] <RollCritFail> It's because of GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION
[0:57:47] <alexandrecau> well yes the police loves the yakuza
[0:57:49] <Prevot> FeelsBadMan
[0:57:50] <Scotaku> Homicide is pretty bad.
[0:57:50] <mercado94> In Japan you dont question your superiors
[0:57:51] <blakeway> Yeah, cuz everyone just puts up with the yakuza, no one gives a shit
[0:57:52] <fruitloop89> Vikings cant beat the Bears gotta get my pat/kiryu beating the shit outta jobbers fix
[0:57:52] <%AncelDeLambert> yes, OF COURSE Vice is below homocide
[0:57:53] <Penatron> Cause organized crime is where all the nice boys are
[0:57:55] <Worldbrand> Well because the crime is so organized they bought out the cops
[0:57:56] <%rdark_ksu> @patstaresat
[0:57:56] <+CarlosEoM> he's explaining the shit
[0:57:59] <%NovaKnightmare> gotta check the hooker vaginas for crime
[0:58:02] <Chester_goes_Berserk> That's true for all white collar crime divisions
[0:58:02] <LiquidMathew> Aren't murders less common in Japan?
[0:58:06] <%Noahccountingfortaste> hey guys, remember that time Majima invented the tax?

[0:58:10] <arcaderabbit48> That's a very fancy bottle
[0:58:10] <alexandrecau> so they don't have much organized crime actually investigated
[0:58:10] <%Imperial_Madman> good
[0:58:11] <ConLin_Plays> they do a lot of crimes but they sometimes help out
[0:58:12] <%sparrrow_> apatHoldon apatWrong apatSmug
[0:58:13] <%TheDude8D> good
[0:58:13] <%GohanEgret> apatHoldon
[0:58:13] <+twohitgood> why is vice an upgrade? @AngriestPat
[0:58:14] <%Remery_> good
[0:58:14] <Tevvy> the yakuza have a pretty weird interaction with the culture and society compared to our organized crime

[0:58:22] <%Chatterbox1991> Because why the fuck is random murder less important than civil/criminal conspiracy?
[0:58:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Kiryu, do you have $10 billion yen from Real Estate I could use"
[0:58:23] <that_owl_guy> Maybe because the Japanese gov didn't want to fuck with the yakuza, because they are wimps
[0:58:24] <ConLin_Plays> YEYE

[1:04:50] <%fFailureatlife> why was the empty lot important anyway? Kappa
[1:04:50] <%gespenst25> would street punks actually fight a yakuzi? that seems like a bad plan to do....
[1:04:50] <CheekyBirb> vo/
[1:04:51] <%TheDude8D> oh yeah they just all get up

[1:05:00] <+namillus> @blakeway Yeah so if they glow red you're boned for a while because you don't get the Dragon Kiwami Finisher until a while into the MAJIMA EVERYWHERE system.
[1:05:01] <dukeoftime> Shit has been thoroughly slapped.
[1:05:01] <TheEnablerr> Faces of steel those guys
[1:05:02] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> especially the tree pop in
[1:05:05] <@SSaryn> All that blood and they're not even dead, because Kiryu doesn't kill Kappa
[1:05:07] <DaBigVitus> It's been like 6 months since I played a looooot of Yakuza games and got burned out. Looks like it's abotu that time again

[1:05:13] <%ThatGuyfromMars> This is as realistic as it gets! *trees pop in*
[1:05:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Can you imagine if Majima found a knife on you, and was like "What's this Kiryu chan? uwu"
[1:05:13] <$drfaustisdead> I can't believe Millennium Tower was just an empty lot that caused a massive gang war a decade ago.
[1:05:15] <Huntercd> At least one of those guys is dead
[1:05:16] <majima666> my theory about kiryu not being in tekken is that he mostly associated with sony
[1:05:17] <that_owl_guy> Giant gang battles with zero interference from law enforcement? Total realism Kappa

[1:18:22] <thetruenicster> if there's one thing I wasn't that much of a fan of in Kiwami 2, its the fact that there was a limit to how much you could eat
[1:18:23] <Dante_the_spooks_man> @angriestpat you’ll need to defeat majima on pocket circuit to get an ability for the dragon style
[1:18:23] <Sunstalker> Don't be a coward from Majima rooFite

[1:18:54] <krymzen5> i thought the idol part was fun
[1:18:55] <$QuanticEline> Idol singing is rad pat.]
[1:18:57] <@SSaryn> Always remember that Jo Amon hired his daughter to become an Amon to defeat Haruka at Idoling because fuck it.

[1:19:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Kiryu is responsible for 30% of Kamurocho's injuries
[1:19:16] <%OldCrustyGeezer> apatDab
[1:19:16] <%spacedroner1> Fair enough
[1:19:16] <+nharliecash> The idol part went on for a long ass time

[1:38:32] <%AlasterAngelo> he kills like 30 people in this game
[1:38:33] <devanmuse> Not even all those people he shot on the highway
[1:38:34] <Worldbrand> NEVER. Not even that one helicopter
[1:38:34] <jarf100> Untrue!!!
[1:38:35] <$Piemono> He shot a helicopter with a rocket launcher

[1:38:38] <Djinn247> It
[1:38:38] <GummyDavidson> This feels weird to watch after playing 6 and Kiwami 2

[1:38:42] <+ilasper1> he shot a bunch of people in the head in 0?
[1:38:42] <VritraReiRei> SPOILERS!? D:
[1:38:43] <emillionghost> that one guy got shot
[1:38:43] <Djinn247> It's in this game i think
[1:38:43] <jarf100> And all those other guys
[1:38:44] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> That scene not for a minute
[1:38:44] <Darren716> He murdered like 50 people on the high way
[1:38:44] <+linSP> HE'S killed EVERYBODY
[1:38:45] <silvcrest> Not. Even. One.
[1:38:45] <Thoravis> except for that one sequence where he shot like a million people
[1:38:45] <mercado94> THE HELICOPTER ONE LUL
[1:38:46] <Big_King_Coconut> didn't he kick somebody out a window?
[1:38:46] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Naaahhhhh
[1:38:46] <%spacedroner1> I mean to be fair, Kiryu didn't shoot the gun
[1:38:47] <+CuttleCrow> NEVER KlLLED
[1:38:47] <randomp141> I was thinking Yakuza 0, the one who flys out a window

[1:38:49] <synthcutter> GET EM BOYS

[1:38:50] <bendatron> yeah that guy
[1:38:51] <%Noahccountingfortaste> and that whole gunning people down on the freeway in 0 @AngriestPat
[1:38:51] <gustavozxd> except for that one guy that he dances around while he's getting shot to death
[1:38:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Also there's a whole stretch of highway gun murders in this game
[1:38:52] <+namillus> He's probably gonna end up killing Nishiki.
[1:38:52] <gunzerkingdunce> using a human shield don't count
[1:38:53] <mongol_800> <massage deleted>
[1:38:53] <krymzen5> he avoids the vital bits
[1:38:54] <alexandrecau> pretty sure he killed that chopper guy in 6
[1:38:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> That one video with taht scene and DAME DAME in the background is priceless
[1:38:55] <+HypotheticalWalrus> he only killed the helicopter
[1:38:55] <itesket> Majima?
[1:38:55] <%Remery_> ????
[1:38:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...what
[1:38:57] <%AncelDeLambert> ..... what?
[1:38:57] <Shisno27> what about when he shot a gun at those people on the highway?
[1:38:58] <BMPixy> In the highway scene his gun was filled with the rubber bullets from Y4.
[1:39:00] <+StrawberryPantsu> HE DROP KICKS A GUY OUT OF A 3RD STORY WINDOW

[1:39:05] <+200percentdad> n....nani
[1:39:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> That's not in 0, that's in this one
[1:39:06] <DaBigVitus> He's used plenty of human meat shields tho
[1:39:07] <eldritchart> Kiryu would do great in the bicycle sales industry. with his luck he would always beat someone with a bike he sold
[1:39:07] <AllTheZibas> STOP HOGGING IT THO
[1:39:08] <Daniel_Is_I> I was hoping he'd just fight with kicks and hold the child the entire time
[1:39:08] <gustavozxd> @randomp141 he survived that fight and comes back later
[1:39:08] <CelioHogane> What the fuck is wrong with this people
[1:39:09] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat Kiriyu didn't kill that man, that other man's gun's bullets killed that man!
[1:39:09] <+InugamiTheHound> didn't kiryu blow up cars with his pistol in yakuza 0??
[1:39:09] <%NWR_James> The highway involved murder
[1:39:10] <GodlyLuigi> you mean that time he blew up multiple cars and helicopters WITH A PISTOL in zero didnt kill ANYONE?
[1:39:11] <TheEnablerr> He just wanted to say something
[1:39:13] <Dante_the_spooks_man> 6 games and we never got to eat a NY style hod dog
[1:39:18] <Sunstalker> He also chainsawwed some dudes in O rooBlank
[1:39:20] <Thepothero> JOBBERS cirSlain
[1:39:22] <$Tuskor13> Use the child to Triple H the goons
[1:39:25] <+InugamiTheHound> BRB
[1:39:25] <KleptoBismol45> Even if he did kill anyone, it'd be in self defense most of the time, so it's fine @angriestpat
[1:39:26] <mrjohncarlton> Kiryu just sent that guy to the Shadow Relm along with those guys in the helicopter
[1:39:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> I mean the gun killed those people... And the rockets...\

[1:39:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> bUT STILL
[1:39:32] <Shoudesuka_mechadork> why is it that holding a child seems to attract all the trouble?
[1:39:33] <%Spec7re> Hold on guys let me upgrade my heat move
[1:39:34] <%Remery_> @Dante_the_spooks_man we don't deserve it :(
[1:39:34] <Baron_von_Turkeyfish> welp i gotta go to work bye everyone
[1:39:34] <+HypotheticalWalrus> those were all non lethal warning shots
[1:39:36] <majima666> dont blame kiryu because they are too thick to move out of the way of his bullets
[1:39:36] <randomp141> @gustavozxd What about when he shoots down the helecopter in one of the other games (4 I think but I could be wrong)
[1:39:36] <+Gamerdude951> He pulled a gun out in Y0 in a fucking CUTSCENE!

[1:40:03] <+Vikken141> MAjima aka ex fountain
[1:40:03] <%SuzakuRising> Kiryu never killed that guy... he just used him as a human shield to defend himself. lol the other guy was the one that pulled the trigger..

[1:40:04] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat Majima is BIG EXP
[1:40:05] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> For sure. You start getting a SHIT ton more, especially from Majima.

[1:58:45] <%Solidnick18> yakuza 5 was alright
[1:58:48] <%BeardedLuchador> imo the combat isn't as satisfying as Y0

[1:59:25] <+LeaIsChill> yare yare
[1:59:25] <artoflec> I think the combat's better in this one because you have instant style switches for things
[1:59:25] <thelonechris> Those guys were just waiting for you
[1:59:27] <%Cavumentum> Thanos and his Echofighter, Mr. Fortnite
[1:59:28] <majima666> well at least 3 does

[1:59:36] <DougintheTrench> Big boys are a bit meatier and have super super armor.
[1:59:38] <%AlasterAngelo> the combat in this game is terrible comparatively. the kiwami moves are the worst offenders
[1:59:40] <+ChaosVulpes> I love how the entire Yakuza storyline can just be summed up with that one Spongebob picture of the fish yelling, "How many times do we have to teach you this lesson OLD MAN!?!"
[1:59:42] <bearwagon> its the same but has style switching mid combat
[1:59:42] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[2:01:45] <%RaidenKyrielite> Uhhh...doesn't the Trouble Finder detect street attacks on civilians,not side stories? Or am I wrong?
[2:01:46] <DaBigVitus> did he break his brain?
[2:01:48] <AzirothTheGreat> It's your sub story finder
[2:01:48] <%aishman> Trouble = side quests dude
[2:01:49] <$ooblagis> Yes
[2:01:49] <thedepreshun> Why does this sound like the American Idol theme
[2:01:50] <RamenRiderZ> This Tekken music tho
[2:01:50] <DaltbotO1> I think you need to move forward in the plot right now
[2:01:53] <CastellanVon> @AngriestPat Might need to progress the story a bit more

[2:02:12] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat The trouble finder causes the substory symbol to appear on your minimap when you pass them by instead of just stumbling onto them
[2:02:13] <$ooblagis> Keep in mind, lots of shit needs story progression
[2:02:14] <dukenux> PogChamp
[2:02:14] <Charlie99993> I think you despawned it

[2:03:30] <%KaironFortressKnight> Pat, if you dash cancel before the last hit of Rush, you can repeat the combo and get easy stuns.
[2:03:32] <Yrefe> get all the KIWAMI!
[2:03:34] <%Toynota10> What chapter are you in?
[2:03:39] <%KaironFortressKnight> You can then do a siiiiick Heat move.

[2:03:42] <Mangahero18> I think the new more simplified combat system in Yakuza 6 and Kiwami 2 is garbage...and Im right so shut up.

[2:09:40] <+KENTASHIRO> Kiryu out here killing dudes
[2:09:41] <%ssjklyco> @serpenttucker Its just a PS4 release of 3. Not a Kiwami. Same engine as the original 3
[2:09:42] <majima666> saejimas old move
[2:09:42] <Jarvanii> he'll be fine
[2:09:43] <+InugamiTheHound> F

[2:09:47] <isaackeifer331> Rip.
[2:09:48] <silvcrest> Hes fine. Its just kayfabe
[2:09:51] <$Tuskor13> He's a fisting artist PogChamp
[2:09:52] <arfsm95> His brain is basically in his stomach right now
[2:09:53] <DougintheTrench> @AngriestPat Yeah, that's the excuse you can use for the creepy sex rock paper scissors that the kids play!
[2:09:55] <%Johnothon> non lethal takedowns
[2:09:55] <Charlie99993> Finally Pat will be jailed for his crimes
[2:09:55] <majima666> yeah, 3-5 are just remasters
[2:09:56] <thetruenicster> Kiryu "has never killed a man" Kazuma strikes again
[2:09:57] <%Klefth> NO HE'S NOT. Kiryu would never kill anyone!
[2:09:59] <CrowbarFacelift> The bosses are worse
[2:09:59] <%spacedroner1> I mean it's just the same engine is it not
[2:10:00] <Cardboard96> It's a bit more polished than 0
[2:10:00] <IronEncore> Just sleeping upside down and inside out
[2:10:01] <%Solidnick18> i liked when money flew out of them
[2:10:01] <alexandrecau> nah he'll live, painfully
[2:10:04] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Chapter 4 is when side quests start opwning, but i guess you need to do Haruka's thing first
[2:10:05] <%brave_sj> I think Zero
[2:10:05] <sackerkappa> Essence of Fisting.
[2:10:05] <reiju_22> except the bossfifhts
[2:10:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You didn't win, those guys just sold super hard
[2:10:06] <+augurgewalt> Kiryu didn't even kill the dudes in the helicopter he blew up, those guys are fine
[2:10:07] <majima666> running in 1080p and 60fps
[2:10:07] <sangi53> I mean it's basically the same as 0
[2:10:08] <silvcrest> See! Just fine!
[2:10:08] <danknugglit> Hes just sleeping
[2:10:09] <%KaironFortressKnight> Bosses are the issues in this one Pat
[2:10:09] <jarf100> The shattered skull only made him big to sleep
[2:10:11] <%Keyd00d> the kiwami move thing is bad
[2:10:13] <+mcjimbles> the fighting is the same I think they meant the boss fights are just moveset swaps from zeeero
[2:10:18] <%brave_sj> I think Zero's music was better
[2:10:18] <zepelinnn> worse bossfights
[2:10:22] <giogio346> The bossfights are much worse in Kiwami
[2:10:23] <TootPirate> what about that time kiryu used a guy as a human bodyshield to stop bullet
[2:10:25] <WayneTheNerd> Pat Must play Fist of the North Star : Lost Paradise
[2:10:30] <%youngjuiceman> Street fights are good, boss fights are trash garbage
[2:10:30] <bearwagon> the Kiwami system actually makes boss fights more annoying than they should br
[2:10:30] <Dante_the_spooks_man> Beast style got nerfed on kiwami
[2:10:31] <gustavozxd> 1 is better than kiwami though....
[2:10:34] <+metalsiren31> The normal movesets are all good. Dragon of Dojima style feels baaaad
[2:10:34] <%aishman> Well, was it 5 that had those issues with it being on the PS3?
[2:10:35] <+augurgewalt> this one has actually worse boss fights than before though
[2:10:35] <majima666> i prefer the original ps2 soundtrack in all honesty
[2:10:36] <+Fallout48> the game plays a lot better moment to moment on the whole over 0
[2:10:37] <tpb847> the best thing in kiwami is that u can change styles during other actions now, like evading, without pause
[2:10:37] <krymzen5> 3s writings a bit meh
[2:10:38] <%aishman> Where the framerate would just tank?
[2:10:38] <+DietKane> the most 3-5 need are the resolution and framerate boosts
[2:10:39] <jarf100> The Kiwami moves aren’t my favorite
[2:10:41] <majima666> same for kiwami 2
[2:10:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Does anyone else think the battle win sound effect sounds a lot like the Dark Souls you died sound effect?
[2:10:43] <ClutchPython> tfw we may not get 3-5 remasters in the west for a very long time FeelsBadMan
[2:10:44] <$Tuskor13> I've noticed a lot of deleted comments this stream aka2S
[2:10:45] <%burkey0307> i hope we get a sequel to 0
[2:10:49] <nutdustcrusaders> That one youtube video of the helicopter bit in 6 is hilarious
[2:10:50] <roflwaffleauthoritah> Didn't 3's western release get butchered?
[2:10:51] <%AlasterAngelo> no
[2:10:51] <Djinnazz> no?
[2:10:51] <%spacedroner1> Yakuza 3 had some weak sauce writing imo but some good moments

[2:26:07] <Shisno27> wait, is he just T-posing in the beast logo in the top left?
[2:26:08] <dukenux> Haruka is a figment of Kiryu's imagination
[2:26:10] <%CubicPhantom> she works the opposite of final fantasy party characters: in the overworld she's around, but in fights she fades away
[2:26:13] <%Solidnick18> did his punch do a stinger
[2:26:15] <Djinn247> i found Beast mode surprisingly useless on higher difficulty
[2:26:18] <%NovaKnightmare> the ooooole dick twist

[2:27:01] <+augurgewalt> the actual worst dude in the entire game is the one that's dual wielding handguns though
[2:27:03] <Dante_the_spooks_man> Kiryu and the cop lady beat the crap out of this guy in 2
[2:27:03] <%jaggiesama> investing in themselves

[2:27:07] <kiryuuva> seeing the name "Kiryu" so many times when my name is Kiryu is so weird.

[2:27:30] <%Keyd00d> Haruka set up an energy barrier
[2:27:31] <dekkitout> behind her magic ward
[2:27:32] <%vaporousTippler> She put down a line of salt like it's fucking Supernatural.
[2:27:32] <bearwagon> protected by the magic red invisible wall

[2:27:56] <Djinn247> OOF
[2:27:56] <+JayEarly> Beast mode lets you end encounters almost instantly in 0
[2:27:57] <+MechaBaphomet> It would be shame if he used the game's mechanics
[2:27:58] <%brave_sj> @AlasterAngelo Beast mode is super good it does good damage and shit
[2:27:59] <AirlineFood74> Pat you need to big heal
[2:27:59] <mayorrev> START PLINKING
[2:28:00] <Cardboard96> mid fight sippy
[2:28:00] <Blank9> 6's bosses were pretty good if you spam dodge strike to stay permanently aggressive
[2:28:02] <jarf100> Make him purple
[2:28:03] <%laserbeaming> Haruka is protected by Infernal Enerfy coming out of the floor

[2:28:19] <%SulfurousAcid> Kiryu drinks Monster Pat
[2:28:21] <%TheShal> In the middle of a fight, Kiryu just chugs down a Monster
[2:28:21] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat how hard would this game be if enemies could use energy drinks?
[2:28:22] <%brave_sj> That's not a sofa
[2:28:23] <vexicbayn> or does pat like redbulls just like Kiryu
[2:28:23] <DaBigVitus> yeah but it wont kill Kiryu
[2:28:23] <%Alexplosion35> Haruka set up a CP field
[2:28:26] <ClutchPython> doesnt yakuza 1/kiwmai have that one boss that is the worst in the entire series?
[2:28:26] <%the_solarflare> using green orbs pat? for shame
[2:28:26] <thelonechris> Pulls out energy drink mid fight and slams it
[2:28:26] <%CubicPhantom> for who can defeat the man chugging Toughness Infinity?
[2:28:28] <$Plutt_bug> PISS MODE
[2:28:30] <CheekyBirb> No, japanese energy drinks aren't as bad as red bull
[2:28:30] <%walternatorz> @AngriestPat don't let paige know you had another red bull
[2:28:32] <%Solidnick18> boom
[2:28:32] <+augurgewalt> to be fair, nishika tried healing in that one bossfight in 0 like this
[2:28:33] <+VoytekBus> i often get pat and kiryu mixed up

[2:28:44] <+ChaosVulpes> GEEZ man... that was brutal
[2:28:44] <%Reizie_Etherealm> THAT'S RAD
[2:28:45] <ecksbockstreefitty> Pat, I suck with Rush mode for most of the game but as I'm sure you know... better get good with brawler mode for "that" boss fight

[2:29:04] <%Remery_> the Kiryu buns
[2:29:05] <sileo_patronus> KIWAMI MEANS MORTIS
[2:29:07] <$Tuskor13> Headbutting someone with excessive force has to be the most double-edged sword you could ever do in unarmed combat
[2:29:12] <vingadivo> rush was wag better
[2:29:13] <Dante_the_spooks_man> This theme is SICK
[2:29:17] <dukenux> KIwami means CHAOS REIGNS
[2:29:21] <Djinn247> The Rush version is wayy better
[2:29:23] <CheekyBirb> kiwami means YAMERO

[2:55:41] <%Toynota10> Make sure you fight Majima as much as you can, caude he gets some very specific quests later
[2:55:41] <%Solidnick18> it goes kiryu chan when he is near by
[2:55:44] <$2Metronomes> You can spot him from a mile away when he walks down the street because he’s always in heat mode

[3:04:52] <ministarbury> holy crap

[3:04:54] <VeryTricky> kiryu never killed anyone

[3:04:58] <dking0000> i"ll bury you in this ally
[3:04:58] <+Omegasinnocence> I see someone picking up a motorcycle and I just stop fighting immediately
[3:04:58] <%Gogogolem> I would just run seeing that shit
[3:04:59] <+Arbal3st> ...And then they all died. The End.
[3:05:00] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> hope that guy had Kiryu insurance!
[3:05:00] <Graywolf_the_45th> Didn't they use this quest for a Yakuza 6 trailer?
[3:05:01] <lefty2k1> "white knight bitch" he says as kiryu FUCKS HIM WITH A MOPED
[3:05:03] <%happyface699> 0 deaths
[3:05:03] <BreakfastMan117> kiryu has murdered hundreds of men
[3:05:03] <%0dokuro> Remember, Kiryu has killed ANYONE...except that one guy
[3:05:04] <+IronPickle> That was somebody's motorcycle
[3:05:08] <%Das_Bass> Why would you fight a guy that can lift a fucking scooter over his head
[3:05:10] <%0dokuro> hasnt*
[3:05:11] <JayPastaForce> If I saw him pick up the a VEHICLE I'd immediately run away.
[3:05:15] <SilverFaustX> WAS someones bike
[3:05:16] <%Spec7re> Nah they aer fine
[3:05:18] <heybenice> Now someone’s going to ask for 10000 yen for his motorcycle
[3:05:20] <%mornerboi> @Omegasinnocence right? like if a dude picked up a fucking motorcycle, i'd straight up be like 'yeah no, nevermind, you win'
[3:05:21] <+CuttleCrow> the problem here is that, after seeing that, these jobbers are still trying to fight him
[3:05:23] <Dante_the_spooks_man> I think kiryu’s suit is the thing that gives him his powers
[3:05:24] <flame_of_udun_> These guys are fucking suicidal
[3:05:24] <%Big_Dream> dead

[3:26:10] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Theres like a cooldown timer but yeah
[3:26:11] <ApocRage> @AngriestPat Most times Majima will just be wandering the street, but he can also spawn in weird places and surprise you.
[3:26:11] <gustavozxd> he might just nto
[3:26:12] <edgymacaroon> yes. sometime in fights
[3:26:15] <DXLelouch24> he can appear and beat your ass while your literally eating a burger

[3:26:47] <Texeu> He gets more regular further you go in his side quest
[3:26:50] <BallisticMeerkat> @AngriestPat kind of, you unlock more of his scenarios as you level him up and do the story, and some sub quests
[3:26:51] <+ilasper1> no one truly understands the innerworkings of the majima everywhere system
[3:26:51] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat yes, but if you want to get dragon moves back, you have to do certain shit

[3:26:54] <%tank7013> @AngriestPat The real joy of the Majima Everywhere system is constantly unlocking more ways for him to ambush you

[3:30:02] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Kiwami 2 is new Dragon engine
[3:30:03] <Worldbrand> He actually gets a big hammer
[3:30:03] <+CuttleCrow> its a singlar style
[3:30:03] <N1netbattler> So you need time to be like a DRAGON
[3:30:04] <+Raidou24> What ever he used in 6
[3:30:04] <alexandrecau> kiwami 2 is back to dragon style
[3:30:04] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> no styles

[3:30:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> tbh i like Dragon Combat more than Zero
[3:30:12] <Dapper_Cactuar> he uses the dragon style, and it's called Legend
[3:30:13] <%jiin6> 6 moveset, cause the engines different
[3:30:13] <OkamiDude15> kiryu rocks the dragon
[3:30:14] <yaboybennyd> Rock the Dragon
[3:30:15] <BanishedLink> Styles are gone in Kiwami 2
[3:30:16] <DougintheTrench> @AngriestPat Kyriu big smash
[3:30:18] <+Fallout48> Dragon but 6's version of it
[3:30:19] <Dante_the_spooks_man> It’s the same move set from 6
[3:30:20] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Weapons Style
[3:30:20] <alexandrecau> dragon engine
[3:30:21] <dking0000> 6 has it's own fighting system which can't really even come close to any of the styles
[3:30:31] <dking0000> Ragdolling is ridiculously fun
[3:30:32] <dukenux> Change here
[3:30:33] <jarf100> Good. I’m kinda getting tired of the 0 and Kiwami styles
[3:30:35] <AirlineFood74> @arfsm95 yes. 0 is a prequel to the original and this, which is a remake of 1
[3:30:38] <%afronooch> @arfsm95 yeah it's after 0. Kiwami is yakuza 1
[3:30:40] <$Plutt_bug> Jiggle her titties in front of everyone
[3:30:43] <%Alexplosion35> Back to the Lupus club
[3:30:48] <+StrawberryPantsu> Or rather I like Judge Etes Combat
[3:30:48] <CastellanVon> Kiwami 2 tightened up 6's fighting system. Feels really good, worthy of being compared to 2.
[3:30:49] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat 6 and Kiwami 2's fighting styles are "Make enemies ragdoll into bowling balls"
[3:30:49] <arfsm95> oh, thanks guys

[4:48:36] <AirlineFood74> He is near

[4:48:51] <AirlineFood74> that's the majima sensor, remember?
[4:48:51] <TyrantSlime> It's the Majima Harassment System

[4:49:13] <+Fallout48> Open your map when you hear it
[4:49:13] <BallisticMeerkat> @AngriestPat THIS IS HOW MAJIMA WORKS, if hes on the map when that goes off go fight him, if hes not on the map it means theres something nearby (sidequest to unlock more situations for majima) or a fight that he will interrupt, and finally theres conditions while walking around that allow him to ambush you
[4:49:15] <+kakita_onimaru> @AngriestPat Magima calls you if one of his spawn points is near you on the radar

[4:49:33] <%ThePuddingDead> look up maybe?
[4:49:33] <randomp141> @AngriestPat It's to alert you a potential fight is near
[4:49:34] <%SulfurousAcid> they'll be moving if he's in 'em
[4:49:36] <CastellanVon> @AngriestPat CHECK THE PORN BUILDING
[4:49:37] <Cannondancer> Maybe hes in the building?
[4:49:37] <benjiFG> He might be in an alleyway
[4:49:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Novembermagnus ...Close
[4:49:39] <%DavidSanChan> in your shoes
[4:49:39] <+Gamerdude951> He despawned
[4:49:40] <gunzerkingdunce> alleys
[4:49:40] <mercado94> is there a truck?
[4:49:41] <takiyami> He despawned because of the fight
[4:49:44] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @Novembermagnus he can kinda jump from the rooftops I think
[4:49:47] <%BeardedLuchador> Fight will get despawned by punks, just like Mr. Shakedown
[4:49:47] <StormShaun> E V E R Y W H E R E

[4:50:05] <%Big_Dream> TO SHINE
[4:50:05] <orphanmonster> Majima might be on the roof somewhere you need to look up
[4:50:07] <randomp141> It only happens after you run into someone.
[4:50:07] <DaltbotO1> There's no point looking he'll show up when he wants to
[4:50:08] <%CubicPhantom> he doesn't like seeing you fight other people
[4:50:13] <%Keyd00d> get him to the MEB
[4:50:14] <0nett> He's in the street cone
[4:50:15] <roflwaffleauthoritah> SKELLMO IS MAJIMA
[4:50:16] <%RadRegice> if you go into and leave a building he'll usually respawn somewhere
[4:50:16] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Paige is actually Majima, thus it continuously goes off on the radar

[4:51:36] <+StrawberryPantsu> KIRYU CHAN
[4:51:36] <%dickbuttwoman> It's not 0 heat
[4:51:44] <%WingBuffet> you just need less than the first bar
[4:51:45] <%tank7013> Isn't there a button combination to vent heat?
[4:51:45] <%joylent_blue> Majima gets jealous when kiryu fights other guys and skulks off
[4:51:46] <disflipmat> There's a calming towel you can equip that negates heat buildup
[4:51:47] <@SSaryn> There's a skill that allows you to reduce heat.
[4:51:47] <+SPplayer> @AngriestPat it isn't 0 heat, its just "not enough for a heat move"
[4:51:47] <JestingAverage0> Yup
[4:51:49] <BallisticMeerkat> @AngriestPat its not 0 heat its just not a full bar

[4:51:56] <sileo_patronus> x + R2 in Dragon Style for 0 heat
[4:51:56] <drewslo> not zero heatjust not in battle
[4:51:58] <%ThatRandomGuy661> @AngriestPat calm means you aren't glowing in a fight
[4:52:00] <bearwagon> calm state just means the bar isnt glowing blue or red

[4:53:42] <randomp141> @AngriestPat the tone just tells you a randombattle has spotted you and is chasing you, Majima's tone is much faster and repeated
[4:53:42] <person181> that did nothing
[4:53:42] <LongLivetheEmpire> Reina is basically "I'm a lesbo I got a gaydar"
[4:53:45] <+hoenhime344> gold champage costs more than a solid gold plate?
[4:53:45] <+namillus> And then after that you can get the specific event

[4:54:09] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat There are two clubs in this game, you need to max out both hostesses for both there substories
[4:54:12] <valentinostand> best girl is actually Chinese
[4:54:12] <Novembermagnus> so can you watch porn in this game too?
[4:54:12] <%DavidSanChan> Sensually headbutt her

[4:54:21] <itesket> THIS IS A TRAP
[4:54:22] <Dante_the_spooks_man> The hostess on this game did not came out well
[4:54:22] <%RadRegice> i wish one of the options was kiryu asking what a tv was

[4:54:42] <$codussalpha> DADDY ISSUES AWAY!
[4:54:43] <%WingBuffet> the Majima Sensor indicates something is on the map in general, it has nothing to do with actual proximity to you. It can literally be across Kamurocho when you hear the Majima noise.
[4:54:43] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Shes actually Majima!
[4:54:43] <+CaptainJax> GIRLS LOVE THE OLD
[4:54:44] <$Plutt_bug> Girls love anal
[4:54:44] <Shaggy087> Is that Rina Hashimoto??
[4:54:46] <itesket> Majima crossdress
[4:54:48] <%PenmanLupine> Show me Anri Okita! We need her
[4:54:49] <+Batvision> Her eyes are like that sad cat meme
[4:54:49] <%TheDude8D> she does love a skeleton
[4:54:49] <WaxWitch> just your girl LUL
[4:54:50] <%joylent_blue> Novembermagnus you can go into a porn booth and just end up watching titanic instead, kiryu cries at the end
[4:54:51] <+Skatedeandre> WHENS YUI

[5:02:41] <%NovaKnightmare> E R E C T
[5:02:41] <+DangerMan83> Majima didn't need to buy a single new item to throw this ensemble together
[5:02:43] <benjiFG> ! wet !
[5:02:43] <tj_timbs> foreshadowing
[5:02:44] <%TheMilhouseExperience> He bought a gold statue of himself. Kiryu was loaded.

[5:03:13] <+Baalem> What did I just tune into lol
[5:03:13] <hazardkujacker> @AngriestPat Probably the Bubble bursting and Kiryu Going to Jail for a decade was the reason he lost the buildings
[5:03:13] <%gespenst25> i guess the real yakuza zeros were the friends we made along the way

[5:23:07] <%TeraMercier> Doytchland
[5:23:12] <SpiritOf_TheFox> Elmo means Extremeee!!!
[5:23:12] <+Answer_Moose> @MisterCrimson probably
[5:23:13] <%maskedriderhero> @sparrrow_ To absorb the sadness

[5:23:31] <alrobot2014> Kiwami means family
[5:23:37] <%CJett92> So it throws it off
[5:23:39] <%Aitch971> Because they are tiny people

[5:24:59] <Bouldus> PILLARS
[5:24:59] <Falketh> div 2
[5:24:59] <+Yokuho> Dragon quest 11
[5:25:00] <%WheatlyXT> Pat is closer to becoming Paige’s perfect man, a skeleton.
[5:25:03] <%AlasterAngelo> I hear PoE2 is poo poo
[5:25:03] <%hatesdps> div 2!
[5:25:04] <%ThePuddingDead> 1
[5:25:06] <%DrPancakeMD> Oh fuck hearing my name come out of those lips got me hard as a rock
[5:25:07] <%blazymaniac> i fell off battlechasers pretty hard right after act 1
[5:25:08] <%OwlLightningMage> Play Outer Worlds on stream
[5:25:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer200 Ok then, GERMAN OPTOMETRY IS ZE GREATEST IN ZE VORLD! The contact lens can shoot a UV laser!
[5:25:10] <+redanimator> what up w Lady in DMC V gaing weight her face is twice the size of 4 model
[5:25:13] <$spacehouse> Dragon Quest 11
[5:25:14] <%faegbeard> Divinity 2 is probably the best cRPG in the last decade.
[5:25:16] <dukenux> Play Tyranny
[5:25:21] <MisterGrowing> dq11
[5:25:22] <Bouldus> pillars 2 is way better then DOS 2
[5:25:26] <%ThePuddingDead> cool ill grab divinity 2
[5:25:28] <%ThePuddingDead> thanks dude
[5:25:30] <HyperBomb21> Have you considered classic Fallout?
[5:25:33] <alrobot2014> wait DOS2 or Divinity 2?
[5:25:39] <laguerrilha> @AngriestPat So i should buy Divinity 2 instead of Pillars 2?
[5:25:39] <%hatesdps> @bouldus get outttt
[5:25:39] <%pimpinahz> yeah play Tyranny you coward
[5:25:40] <mr_slaide> He means DOS2.
[5:25:40] <HeadsHeldHigh> Thats ORIGINAL SIN 2
[5:25:45] <HeadsHeldHigh> Not just divinity lol
[5:25:46] <Fynale> @redanimator i mean look at her art from 3-4 she got a larger chest and in 5 her chest went back to 3 size
[5:25:52] <%TeraMercier> Classic fallout would be really slow and have a steep learning curveish
[5:25:54] <+Answer_Moose> @ThePuddingDead I mean you should still get Pillars. It's great.
[5:25:59] <Bouldus> its very "gamey"
[5:26:01] <+JenovasPuppet> Pi2ars
[5:26:02] <Zombrocom> Everyone is talking about DOS2
[5:26:02] <%sparrrow_> Original Sin 1 is only $10 right now
[5:26:02] <%bluetocho13> ew Paige looked at Pat and smile with loving eyes
[5:26:04] <Bouldus> @hatesdps also no?
[5:26:05] <%aishman> So, Divinity 2 is an amazing game, especially if you play it with friends
[5:26:08] <+Yokuho> Obsidrones never learn, pillars is BORING
[5:26:10] <mr_slaide> They're both good games.
[5:26:11] <smallboops> pat needs to just straight up play dnd or shadowrun
[5:26:13] <agiantpileoftrash> brain toot
[5:26:15] <nathorz1> Hi mestr Strimmer!
[5:26:15] <fatalDestiny> Divinity 2 has a weak 3rd quater, but the definitive versions fixed a lot of that,
[5:26:17] <%low_hell_key> Yo pat you hear about that Granblue fantasy relink game?
[5:26:23] <%ThePuddingDead> okie doke
[5:26:24] <$codussalpha> Plus it basically lets you be Ainz ooal Gown with the skeleton head
[5:26:27] <+megaotter> Pat would you ever consider playing Legacy of Kain games on Stream? Always wanted to see you LP those
[5:26:29] <StormShaun> Honestly, just both are good. Get both if you can. crikGood
[5:26:29] <%aishman> There's no game, none, that gave me the sensation that a tabletop rpg does other than OS2.
[5:26:37] <%Big_Dream> the sun down is spreading to pat
[5:26:38] <BeeNoons> get for the elmo in game
[5:26:40] <%hatesdps> yeah i mean thats totally a fair reason though theres a lot of weird stuff in it like the physics damage conversion
[5:26:48] <%aishman> Also shame that Pillar 2 did so bad commercially
[5:26:54] <HyperBomb21> I don't real-time-with-pause combat, so i cant get into Pillars
[5:26:55] <%CJett92> Ora is Star Platinum, Dora is Crazy Diamond
[5:26:58] <%TeraMercier> It's almost like JoJo inspired tons of shit
[5:26:59] <+Skatedeandre> Wait...
