If Silent hill ever gets rebooted, I would love to see the radio and flashlight combined into one of those hand-cranked emergency tools. That way the player would have to recharge itevery so often for its use.
[0:06:50] <%Sora20030c> Pyramid head has another 10 days I think?
[0:06:52] <%Sora20030c> 16th iirc

[0:08:59] <%SpcOpsBear> Sweet we get to see Pat's beautiful face again. I am saying that with not an ounce of irony.
[0:09:14] <%Sora20030c> I used to hate DBD because I only tried survivor, Pat playing killer made me try it again and now I own all DLC for the game so...
[0:09:26] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Pat is a qt tbh
[0:09:26] <+evilmagetim> Ayy
[0:09:28] <%YakumoYomi> I want to see him slap his orb to assert dominance.
[0:09:30] <%Starotter70> Hullo
[0:09:30] <Darren716> Is Pat doing the Pyramid Head stuff?
[0:09:38] <nilla_24> yes
[0:09:45] <%arancet> no
[0:09:49] <%Kataguro> I look forward to Pat not understanding how Overwhelm works in all games
[0:09:57] <%arancet> the beta with PH in it was taken down, so he cant use him atm
[0:09:57] <@SoFarFetched> Couldn't do Pyramid head since it's offline now.
[0:10:12] <@SoFarFetched> so he had a poll yesterday asking if people still wanted to see Dead by Deadlight today still

[0:13:46] <%Typhaeon> Godawful Destiny event - you mean all of them?
[0:13:49] <@SSaryn> I watched people witness it. Wasn't that cool and took 80 minutes longer than it should.
[0:13:49] <+MidnightBurst12> wear a mask, people
[0:13:52] <%Nordguy> You hear they're rolling out sound weapons that get so loud the can burst your eardrums? shit's fucked
[0:13:54] <+Rheyr> @SpcOpsBear I hold your fate in my hands!
[0:14:01] <+D00msDayDan> but there's a little crater near zavala now
[0:14:09] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> sounds very "original"
[0:14:09] <Deadmanslegacy> we've been having protests in my home town, I got a 12 gage next to me every night.
[0:14:12] <%redrins> there's that tiny crater by zavala LUL

[0:14:33] <+patrickng714> what was the whole point of it anyways?
[0:14:40] <%Bailey__gaming> Big lies
[0:14:44] <+evbites> WHY
[0:14:56] <%nofestu2> 1 aeiou?
[0:14:58] <+xenoriddley36> @PatStaresAt when you gonna trim that beard bush?!
[0:15:03] <%Typhaeon> The sun is pretty big too
[0:15:03] <+evbites> who blows up a sun
[0:15:03] <%Ninestempest> 1 AU
[0:15:12] <%Ninestempest> someone who wants to wipe out a solar system?
[0:15:13] <ShichiNoBushi> Crowd: "How big is it?"
[0:15:17] <%cvp5127> the mission or the sun?
[0:15:21] <%sniffy77> isnt it the size of mercury or something
[0:15:24] <%Aydarkzero> tghe mission
[0:15:26] <%Starotter70> Fan go Brrrrrrrr
[0:15:28] <%Ninestempest> it's like half of mercury
[0:15:32] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> crash!!! crash what!!! omg!
[0:15:33] <ethanjbennnett> ORB
[0:15:33] <%Ninestempest> so it's like half of a planet
[0:15:34] <%Plus_On_Black> What's really really good, Pat?
[0:15:36] <blackbaron98> Indentation
[0:15:37] <$boomboxvillain> I see the cat!
[0:15:38] <HologramInteractive> eyyyyyyyyy
[0:15:39] <DracaenaLeaf> Orb zoom
[0:15:42] <%Aydarkzero> yeah it's wing span is roughly the size of Mercury
[0:15:42] <%DappercatEsquire> Crash and the Boys?
[0:16:03] <$QueequegTheater> THATS WRONG
[0:16:13] <majindusto> Man, Pat looks Scraggly AS FUCK!!!
[0:16:21] <%redrins> nice fireworks tho Kappa
[0:16:24] <%patriotrenegade> only
[0:16:29] <jase__x> took 2 hours too happen
[0:16:33] <Futurecity10> Bungi hasnt made a good game since Reach
[0:16:35] <$QueequegTheater> How is the City not literally glassed
[0:16:35] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Destroying it like that would only spread the same mass of debris across a wider area
[0:16:37] <%W1nterTitan> LUL
[0:16:38] <%Aydarkzero> it was kind of in the atmosphere though
[0:16:39] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> smart smart smart
[0:16:39] <@SSaryn> Or at least like, half of it completely ruined.
[0:16:41] <%valriot> It wasnt that big
[0:16:46] <@SSaryn> Like, The Farm should be DSTROYED.
[0:16:47] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt The Guardians only made it worse
[0:16:52] <%Ninestempest> lmao the farm
[0:16:52] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, an extinction level event would occur
[0:16:56] <%DappercatEsquire> I dunno, space wizard shit
[0:16:59] <+D00msDayDan> my favorite part was when palpatine showed up to give a speech
[0:17:01] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> science is har I guess
[0:17:04] <%Ninestempest> even if not earth, the last city for sure
[0:17:07] <%Ninestempest> It was blown up yes
[0:17:10] <%Typhaeon> Apart from that one really difficult exotic quest is there even a reason to visit the Farm
[0:17:14] <%Fooguwu> fuckin The Farm. Even I remember that shit from like 12 years ago
[0:17:15] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt It was a chunk, like Star Wars destroyer size
[0:17:22] <%Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt some of it's wing span was left behind i believe
[0:17:23] <ShichiNoBushi> A colony drop is a common threat in Gundam.
[0:17:30] <%patriotrenegade> the asteroid the killed the dinosaurs has to be 6 miles, and that didnt glass the planet @PatStaresAt
[0:17:32] <%Ninestempest> So whoever said it wasn't mercury can fuck off
[0:17:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> earth should have been vaporized
[0:17:36] <%Aydarkzero> wait the Levithan?
[0:17:36] <Senselessvirus> "But Pat" says Bungie "The Traveler is awake so it clearly protected the city and teh earf!" GOD I hated this season.
[0:17:46] <+MidnightBurst12> earth would be a dust cloud
[0:17:47] <%patriotrenegade> 1 mile isnt enough
[0:17:47] <$QueequegTheater> @patstaresat That's NY to like Oklahoma
[0:17:48] <%Aydarkzero> you mean the Almighty?
[0:17:52] <j0ustar> would've shifted the goddamn planet
[0:17:57] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt It didn't look like it was even broken up that much. It was like 80% intact
[0:17:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> maybe Earth is a Guardian.
[0:18:01] <%tumzfestival> Ya'll hear about the 2 superearths?
[0:18:03] <%patriotrenegade> SOME STUFF LIVED
[0:18:06] <%Typhaeon> If it was a solid object that didn't break up at all on reentry
[0:18:06] <%sniffy77> The really should of began stopping it before it was on Earths doorstep.
[0:18:09] <%Aydarkzero> no but Space Magic though shut up
[0:18:11] <%Ninestempest> @FennecZephyr the wings are in the atmosphere now, but the main engine is gone
[0:18:12] <BrachyZoid> Howdy~
[0:18:13] <%Jeemukun> Sci-Fi Writers have no sense of scale
[0:18:13] <%cvp5127> lit
[0:18:14] <%Starotter70> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[0:18:15] <+evbites> SICK
[0:18:15] <%GrumblePlays> ahoy fuckers
[0:18:16] <%tumzfestival> ... "Lit"
[0:18:16] <%Typhaeon> The City would not exist
[0:18:18] <%patriotrenegade> IT LIT
[0:18:20] <%Kataguro> It's lit
[0:18:26] <Captain_Joe1911> cakee5Tuntun
[0:18:29] <%Ninestempest> the point is the city woudl be gone and so would all of humanity
[0:18:34] <HologramInteractive> it really is anyway
[0:18:34] <$QueequegTheater> The planet shouldn't even be here after the Almighty hit it
[0:18:36] <ShichiNoBushi> It blocked out the sun with all the dust it threw into the atmosphere.
[0:18:37] <@SSaryn> So even at a mile, the structural integrity of the Last City shouldn't even be able to be afloat now.
[0:18:42] <+JustToWatch> The Almighty was made entirely of styrofoam, that explains everything
[0:18:45] <%sniffy77> Now we got the pyramid ships which are approaching super slowly
[0:18:46] <%tumzfestival> hehehe
[0:18:50] <%Aydarkzero> Next Season though PogChamp
[0:18:52] <+D00msDayDan> thanks fomo
[0:18:53] <%valriot> ??? No it didnt?
[0:19:02] <%Typhaeon> We've seen the equivalent of like 5 miles on this one planet, clearly that's all to do there
[0:19:02] <%DappercatEsquire> @rumtumtugnutz Yeah, maybe Earth is actually a god and there's a giant sword through it nobody noticed until recently
[0:19:03] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 10 in the channel!

[0:19:25] <%YakumoYomi> If the ship is has a wingspan the width of Mercury (which is 3000 miles in diameter), then Earth should be gone
[0:19:27] <j0ustar> yep.
[0:19:29] <%Fooguwu> Fuggins4ThePeople
[0:19:31] <%Typhaeon> Fuggins for all of you
[0:19:34] <derekwst3> well black hole is on my bingo card for 2020
[0:19:39] <%MajorCrasher> no shut up tho
[0:19:41] <%valriot> Like we're talking about literally space magic, its star wars. Noone cares. The only people who care are the people looking to shit on Destiny cos their shitty Recluse is getting sunset
[0:19:41] <%TrollKing96> So what you're saying is that Bungie should've closed shop after Halo Reach.
[0:19:41] <%Typhaeon> also fuggins for wii u
[0:19:42] <%MidnightBurst12> Ayyy
[0:19:43] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> I can feel my anxiety tingling
[0:19:46] <Futurecity10> All destiny is, is space magic
[0:19:47] <%Jeemukun> shit falling on your planet from SPACE is gonna ruin your day yo
[0:19:47] <%Agami23> huh. even the horror ARG i follow on twitter is stopping for abit to tell people to donate to BLM charities.
[0:19:47] <%Aydarkzero> the Eyslsuim ship from X5 caused a bigger explosion to the earth than the almighty LUL
[0:19:50] <@SSaryn> Nah Traveler said NO to that shockwave.
[0:19:52] <%DappercatEsquire> Fuck dude space wizard shit *shrug*
[0:19:53] <tonfirean> One of the things that annoyed me about Firefly was how close the Reaver ship passed to Serenity in outer space.
[0:19:55] <%MajorCrasher> THERE'S NO TIME PAT
[0:19:55] <%Keyd00d> it's fine tho
[0:19:55] <$QueequegTheater> Halo 4 was good
[0:20:00] <megaman_sentinel> its space magic tho
[0:20:00] <+skylerpilot> the Traveler though Pat, The Traveler though
[0:20:02] <%tumzfestival> THATS THE WORST
[0:20:03] <BrachyZoid> I believe that
[0:20:04] <%redrins> eh the light protected shit or smth, they can just handwave it
[0:20:05] <%Fooguwu> Fuggins now available on the Nintendo Switch
[0:20:07] <Futurecity10> Halo 4 was trash
[0:20:09] <%Fooguwu> true of warframe too
[0:20:10] <%Piemono> But Pat by raising Earth's Light lvl it can over come anything
[0:20:11] <%Keyd00d> Destiny is Destiny
[0:20:11] <%Typhaeon> Destiny is an object lesson on why sci-fi and fantasy should remain separate genres
[0:20:11] <@Fuggins4U> I enjoyed playing Destiny a lot, especially with Pat and Strident and other friends
[0:20:11] <%valriot> You take months off from FFXIV
[0:20:11] <swipperswapper> like warframe
[0:20:13] <%cvp5127> whats the good bad ratio?
[0:20:16] <SkeIeking> "Bungie should've stayed with Activision" ~ Patrick Boivan Kappa
[0:20:18] <+xenoriddley36> Hey pat, should I play DS2 or Scholar of the first sin?
[0:20:18] <@Fuggins4U> but I echo his frustrations
[0:20:22] <+pectusumbra> oh boy, tornado warnings for hte next 35 minutes. yaaaay -_-
[0:20:27] <$QueequegTheater> @xenoriddley36 Scholar
[0:20:29] <%patriotrenegade> i stopped after the first game
[0:20:29] <%Typhaeon> Because you need plausibility to have sci-fi work, at least a little
[0:20:33] <@SSaryn> Yeah same, I wish I played more before I didn't.
[0:20:40] <%valriot> You play controller, its broken on controller
[0:20:41] <Jodoxk1> LUL
[0:20:42] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[0:20:43] <%Aydarkzero> thought it was mostly nerfed on k&m
[0:20:45] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt they knew you'd be unstoppable
[0:20:45] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @xenoriddley36 ik you didn't but I will just yes 2x
[0:20:49] <derekwst3> @pectusumbra hope you are able to stay safe
[0:20:51] <%patriotrenegade> the sword part in Destiny 1 was the coolest part of the entire series and you cannot convince me otherwisew
[0:20:53] <LordPhol> Destiny is great when ur just enjoying the fun gameplay, it's awful when u actually try to farm anything or get into the "story"
[0:20:59] <%optimasmaximas> same thing happened to me in d1 with last word lol
[0:20:59] <+pectusumbra> just chilling in my room
[0:21:00] <BrachyZoid> Controller is not an issue with bad gameplay
[0:21:01] <%sniffy77> I started playing Halo 5 again. Gotta get used to the new mechanics.
[0:21:11] <%valriot> its literally only nerfed on PC, and it was doing like 0.4s body shot kill. Shut up, youre being suh a fucking baby
[0:21:11] <$QueequegTheater> @patstaresat Destiny should've ended at Taken King
[0:21:17] <%Starotter70> It's Nerf or Nothing
[0:21:19] <%JumboCrunchies> Hey Pat, I'm looking at picking up DBD But I am scared I'll be bad. Is it still fun if you are bad?
[0:21:20] <%redrins> we getting that armor rebalance AND armor sunsetting making the sunsetting MUTE and POINTLESS
[0:21:20] <%thelonechris> Pat looks extra crusty today
[0:21:21] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Pat just got me to not wanna play this game
[0:21:21] <%optimasmaximas> @queequegtheater fax
[0:21:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> !uptime
[0:21:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 21m 33s.
[0:21:33] <%valriot> DBD, a buggy shit pile
[0:21:33] <%Typhaeon> Bungie remains a hollowed-out shell of the company that made Marathon, news at 11
[0:21:35] <%YakumoYomi> @Starotter70 psaUp
[0:21:36] <+FennecZephyr> Scifi writers have no sense of scale
[0:21:37] <Hayato182004> Destiny is Destiny.
[0:21:37] <+StooEsq> Debbie Daylight
[0:21:38] <zamzoph> "competitive"
[0:21:39] <%Sora20030c> the meme about Pig getting nerfed still stands
[0:21:44] <megaman_sentinel> thorn was a bit op tho
[0:21:45] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Density 2
[0:21:48] <%TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt So what you're saying is that Bungie should've closed shop after Halo Reach.
[0:21:49] <XdaXcaptainX> yayaya time to watch baby killer? or is pat a big strong murderer
[0:21:50] <%GrumblePlays> it's survivor
[0:21:53] <%GrumblePlays> there's no question
[0:21:53] <+D00msDayDan> that means they're doing it right
[0:21:55] <%Kataguro> It's definitely Survivor
[0:21:55] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Sup patron
[0:21:58] <+evbites> Des:NO YOUR A DIRTY SPACE HOBO WITH A PEA SHOOTER AND A LIMP CARBOARD TUBE
[0:21:59] <$boomboxvillain> Do you think destiny would be better without pvp?
[0:22:00] <@SSaryn> I should mention someone came up with a way better way of shoving the Almighty back into space by just using ships and putting a whole bunch of Titans on it and using their Titan Crash on it. And it would totally work.
[0:22:02] <BrachyZoid> I mean.... have you seen what they did to Toolboxes???
[0:22:08] <$QueequegTheater> @patstaresat It's because they're balancing PvP and PvE but only catering to PvP
[0:22:09] <Sora20030c> I feel like the blatantly favor survivors, mainly because there is MANY more survivors than killers
[0:22:11] <+Kataguro> Paige is a survivor main. Of course she complains
[0:22:12] <@SoFarFetched> Damn
[0:22:12] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> real talk
[0:22:12] <+evilmagetim> Dead hard agrees
[0:22:20] <edodar> toolboxs work in bursts
[0:22:24] <+Nostalgiatron_> Tool boxes repair faster now but go out super fast

Hey Pat, I should thank you for getting me into 14 because it's been my happy place during the recent end times. Just got WHM to 80 and I'm working on DRK. Any tips for someone who keeps falling off tank classes?
[0:22:34] <%valriot> The only people who complain about being underpowered in Destiny, are the trash players, who think Recluse should be meta till the game dies
[0:22:44] <%Mendin> *holds the corpse of Ruin* "Look at him... look what they've done to my boy..."
[0:22:47] <BrachyZoid> NotLikeThis
[0:22:53] <%GrumblePlays> yeah killers get a rough deal, devs favour survivors because most new players are survivors and want the experience to be easy for them
[0:22:54] <+gazingeye1> Survivors could each be given a monster killing gun and theyd still complain....

[0:23:10] <rekinom> I've never played dead by daylight, what's barbecue and chili?
[0:23:14] <%Sora20030c> still upset about Ruin being nerfed like, the week after I finally leveled hag enough to get it
[0:23:27] <%Starotter70> Basically already in the wheelchair
[0:23:28] <%JumboCrunchies> JumboCrunchies converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:23:29] <XdaXcaptainX> the single most important killer perk in the game
[0:23:31] <%spiritofmojave> look like?
[0:23:35] <%Sora20030c> BBQ and Chili is a real good perk that gives you more of the farmable currency (BP)
[0:23:37] <%dekkitout> 34's the new 87
[0:23:37] <%thelonechris> And they're right
[0:23:37] <XdaXcaptainX> doubles blood points

[0:23:50] <+EyeFarted> UH OH
[0:23:50] <%Sora20030c> while also making it so when you hook a survivor it reveals the location of the other survivors
[0:23:52] <%Bishop_Shidux> SHAVE EVERYTHING
[0:23:53] <marvel877> Shave your head so you can transform from ORB into EGG.

[0:24:10] <Mariakko> Just shave it yourself
[0:24:11] <@Fuggins4U> @PatStaresAt careful she doesn't spit in your hair
[0:24:12] <megaman_sentinel> DIY
[0:24:12] <%bendatron> never shave the beard ever again
[0:24:13] <ShichiNoBushi> It'll take a weak to cut all your hair?
[0:24:14] <%GrumblePlays> @rekinom it's a perk that gives more points and lets the killer see where the survivors are for a few seconds when they hook someone

[0:33:42] <%cvp5127> stream snipe got it
[0:33:43] <%JumboCrunchies> Is it too late to get into DBD as a new player? I hear the community is mean.
[0:33:44] <%Mister_McDerp> GUN
[0:33:44] <xWanderingFlame> devilnDIO devilnDIO devilnDIO
[0:33:45] <Futurecity10> I'm gonna buy the game just to stem snip
[0:33:46] <@SSaryn> I'm gonna Rainbow Map and Flashlight so hard
[0:33:46] <%GrumblePlays> i'm pretty sure i'm rank 20 anyway
[0:33:46] <BrachyZoid> Is it even possible to snipe in this game? the matchmaking is garbage xD
[0:33:49] <%Fooguwu> pat's pussy is like a desert
[0:33:49] <%BudaBryan> you don't pay my sub
[0:33:49] <%tumzfestival> UGh I forgot this game had that nonsense
[0:33:52] <%wjones0415> no dice!
[0:33:52] <%ChaosAethr> So Stream Sniped?
[0:33:54] <Badpest> vineSchut
[0:33:57] <+michingmallecho> Snipers no sniping
[0:33:58] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:34:01] <%texaporte> pat is so dry, he's not actually that pale, he's just ashy as fuck
[0:34:01] <zeif00> Deathsilnger main?
[0:34:02] <Gutsandlove> wash your hands chat
[0:34:02] <%Starotter70> Cleeeeeeeean
[0:34:07] <wyrdboy21121> @JumboCrunchies no, though toxic communities are common no matter what you play
[0:34:08] <%thelonechris> ...
[0:34:10] <%tumzfestival> @texaporte LULW
[0:34:12] <%Lizard0TM> "Hey why's that guy nstanding over there with a gun breathing hard?"
[0:34:15] <+michingmallecho> lets all do a hand wash 🧼
[0:34:19] <swipperswapper> he has a basement sink?
[0:34:19] <jimmytwofeet> WHERE IS PATO-CHAN
[0:34:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JumboCrunchies you'll get styled on by killers but its not that toxic
[0:34:23] <Futurecity10> gonna go piss on my hands and visit my local fishery
[0:34:34] <%rideroftraps1> Water Time
[0:34:41] <PanicSwytch> Clean the mouse and keyboard and controller while ur at it
[0:34:42] <kazoomageddon> looks like we got elmo cam back after all, even if briefly
[0:34:44] <+Plus_On_Black> I hate the movie but Jeepers Kreepers would be a good addition to this game.
[0:34:45] <%rideroftraps1> psa1guy
[0:34:50] <+evbites> i feel like the bayonet is over kill
[0:34:54] <%mield916> Pat, Could you confirm that a fucking enormous metal case crashing into earth would cause more damage than a rock a 10th of the size
[0:34:55] <%Sora20030c> survivors are usually more toxic to me in DBD, I get tbagged after pallet stuns etc
[0:34:58] <+Kennentebest> since when did you play dbd pat
[0:35:02] <BrachyZoid> Oh yeah to get them points
[0:35:06] <%Kataguro> It's challenges
[0:35:07] <@SSaryn> @mield916 Already has
[0:35:08] <%GrumblePlays> oh god the challenges make some games unbearable
[0:35:12] <%thelonechris> It's the Krypt
[0:35:20] <%Sora20030c> you complete the challenges to get BP and points for the rift which is the battle pass
[0:35:26] <%Sora20030c> you can also access the past tomes
[0:35:34] <%mield916> Thats what I thought stinkboi
[0:35:35] <%Sora20030c> if you go to the compendium
[0:35:40] <BrachyZoid> I may or may not have sold my team just to get a few of the challenges
[0:35:41] <%Laecerelius> Pat big on murder!
[0:35:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> What killer is pat I say Clown
[0:35:56] <%Sora20030c> there's certain items you can only get from pass
[0:35:57] <wyrdboy21121> killer is so frustrating at higher ranks
[0:36:00] <%DappercatEsquire> ANTI #SPONSORED
[0:36:00] <zeif00> Only get it if you're already way far ahead
[0:36:04] <Misfit_Tempo> why do so many girls play this game btw?
[0:36:04] <ShichiNoBushi> *Killed* it.
[0:36:04] <Gutsandlove> could be better
[0:36:05] <Zebroneath> Compared to other games battle passes, it's not great.
[0:36:07] <+Kennentebest> i bought every single one so far :(
[0:36:09] <%dekkitout> As battlepasses tend to be
[0:36:18] <rissaleigh14> It totally is I bought the first one and it was so not worth it
[0:36:18] <%BoneofMalkav> Pat is Goblin psaGoblin
[0:36:21] <%Mendin> Ezekiel Rage
[0:36:24] <Gutsandlove> im about to finish it
[0:36:26] <%Sora20030c> the tier... 27? I think on this one has a nice legion shirt
[0:36:30] <%JumboCrunchies> Do they give you the option to spend more money to skip levels? Like CoD does?
[0:36:34] <%GrumblePlays> ah man you're making me want to play this for the first time in like three months
[0:36:34] <Thewoodentree> Genuinely surprised this game is still being played
[0:36:35] <%Sora20030c> everything else is kind of meh
[0:36:42] <socratetris> currently I'm playing Red Dead Redemption 2. This game is... very slow paced
[0:36:57] <%dekkitout> Ooo, what's this cool guy's lore?
[0:36:58] <%rideroftraps1> Pop
[0:37:04] <weirdducks> pat what are your thoughts on pig
[0:37:33] <Ujean917> Will you be prestiging or dont care for bloody guns?
[0:37:34] <%Sora20030c> doesn't help they nerfed her a ton
[0:37:35] <%thelonechris> Is it too late to start playing DBD?
[0:37:37] <%Starotter70> That'll do Pig
[0:37:37] <+SlightlySychotic> Do you get STBL stacks on hook hits?
[0:37:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout A engineer turned bounty hunter who hated a rich and powerful asshole that killed his dads business
[0:37:37] <@SSaryn> Better than Ghostface honestly.
[0:37:45] <zeif00> Ever try Nemesis+STBFL speed builds?
[0:37:47] <%Sora20030c> I love the concept of pig so much, just wish she felt better to play
[0:37:48] <wyrdboy21121> she's good at stopping loops with ambush ability
[0:37:49] <zeif00> wait
[0:37:50] <%GrumblePlays> I've wanted to get into Ghostfast but the pressure of being killer gets too much for me
[0:37:57] <%dekkitout> @doc_ock_rokc What a hero~
[0:37:58] <Thewoodentree> Terror Radius vs Ground FEAR-o
[0:37:58] <XdaXcaptainX> is that a joke, ghostface can actually secure hooks
[0:37:59] <%JaydenSai> As someone who actually likes Clown, his buff is welcome
[0:38:11] <%tumzfestival> I want corny Halloween costume skins for some of them...
[0:38:16] <+witchdoctornatyli> man nemisis from re3 would be an interesting killer
[0:38:26] <Zerotoad5> How does Q ing work in this
[0:38:34] <zeif00> Nemesis+PWYF Kreygasm
[0:38:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout Ehhhh he also murdered people, robbed people and more
[0:38:41] <weirdducks> I asked because I'm thinking about playing this game and pig just looks fun to me
[0:38:42] <Nomad_Scholar> @PatStaresAt Do you think Cheryl could off the Entity? she's killed one God before.
[0:38:50] <%Sora20030c> in the PTB
[0:38:53] <wyrdboy21121> it's coming next patch
[0:38:53] <hoopray> Clown Buff?
[0:38:54] <%dekkitout> @doc_ock_rokc Cannibal stuff?
[0:38:56] <%Sora20030c> he doesn't get slowed down while throwing bottles iirc
[0:38:57] <%GrumblePlays> it'll probably come in with the dlc
[0:39:00] <%Mendin> They're buffing the clown?!?
[0:39:02] <%Fooguwu> buff clowns
[0:39:04] <%JaydenSai> @PatStaresAt Its in PTB, he doesnt get slowed by reloading bottles
[0:39:05] <+Kennentebest> previously he slowed down when he threw his slowdown bottles LUL
[0:39:14] <%Starotter70> Stronk Honk
[0:39:16] <zeif00> Clown is so slow
[0:39:16] <wyrdboy21121> I love playing clownman
[0:39:17] <wrightlight94> zentreClown buff clown
[0:39:19] <%DappercatEsquire> I'm a little bit of a clown buff, if I do say so myself
[0:39:20] <%JaydenSai> Clown good
[0:39:27] <%rideroftraps1> remenber CHERYL can negate pop when she Launches
[0:39:29] <%ChaosAethr> PAT IS IT TIME TO GUN
[0:39:30] <lilferniee> he loves suckin on them fingers
[0:39:38] <LordPhol> yeeehaaaw!
[0:39:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout I don' t think so but more sadistic shit like making a gun that doesn't kill you via harpoon....
[0:39:40] <xWanderingFlame> devilnGasm devilnGasm devilnGasm
[0:39:44] <+Kennentebest> Do you play this game often?
[0:39:50] <+CptCreampuff16> embrace you american in you
[0:39:51] <%DesertPenguin> Is Clown their version of IT?
[0:39:52] <Kazzackthuul> Any Kaiju Killers?
[0:39:57] <+cyberpunk998> Killer queue pepega
[0:39:58] <$personmanthingg> how does the DLC work for this game?
[0:40:02] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Just Runeterra while you queue and we can get both done at once
[0:40:03] <@SoFarFetched> No Kaiju
[0:40:08] <%dekkitout> Yeah, but harpoons's are cool- unless you're an aquatic mammal
[0:40:19] <%Sora20030c> the matchmaking at this time blows, I tend to play late at night when I get instant queue
[0:40:21] <hoopray> how is Freddy now?
[0:40:22] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't like how much it costs to get everybody
[0:40:23] <%GrumblePlays> @personmanthingg you can play with/against any dlc character but you can't play as them
[0:40:23] <pumpkinspicepunch> Do you play survivor a lot?
[0:40:27] <$personmanthingg> ah
[0:40:27] <Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt Hope youre having a good one
[0:40:33] <MarylandJutsu> Pat as Killer: YOU KIDS GET off my LAWN
[0:40:35] <%GrumblePlays> if you don't have the dlc i mean
[0:40:36] <Dingalow> This game looks preddy kewl
[0:40:37] <%ChaosAethr> ????
[0:40:42] <hoopray> oh that's smart
[0:40:47] <%Kataguro> Big cheats
[0:40:48] <%ChaosAethr> Oh
[0:40:50] <%AncelDeLambert> mostly I don't like the fact that if I wanted to buy a killer with real money, I have to buy a useless survivor at the same time
[0:40:57] <wyrdboy21121> you get sound cue when you start chase with obsession
[0:40:58] <%DesertPenguin> ?
[0:40:58] <zeif00> Get those sweet stacks
[0:41:02] <Ghostduck01> is that bill from left 4 dead?
[0:41:02] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't play survivor, I don't want to buy them
[0:41:05] <%tumzfestival> Pat's a good killer..... Ummm
[0:41:11] <Dingalow> You like to take pics of people in lobby so you can doxx them? Wow, Pat
[0:41:16] <BunnyEmperor> yeah that's Bill from L4D
[0:41:21] <rissaleigh14> You can buy killers and survivors separately with the auric cells
[0:41:22] <Ghostduck01> ah
[0:41:39] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, and they cost an OBSCENE number of cells
[0:41:40] <%tumzfestival> the science of MURDER
[0:41:42] <%Typhaeon> You have a lot of crossover content in this game but most of them feel like very loose adaptations of characters
[0:41:43] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat takes pictures of people so he know who to kill and not to kill, don't get it twisted folks
[0:41:46] <dinnydanny777> So what have the Dead by Daylight characters done to be hunted by Pyramid Head anyway
[0:41:57] <+Kennentebest> and non-licensed killers you can earn in-game
[0:42:00] <%AncelDeLambert> indoor maps suck in general
[0:42:02] <Gutsandlove> oh boy
[0:42:12] <SGrim> Kill bill?
[0:42:14] <Dingalow> That's how he be irl lol
[0:42:15] <+Kennentebest> although it can take a while
[0:42:15] <%AncelDeLambert> did they add grass?.. no
[0:42:16] <@SSaryn> OH KILL BILL? Kappa
[0:42:16] <%ChaosAethr> KILL BILL
[0:42:16] <rissaleigh14> Rip
[0:42:16] <MarylandJutsu> Don't Kill Bill, the sequel to kill bill no one wanted
[0:42:17] <%dekkitout> (Don't) Kill Bill
[0:42:18] <+D00msDayDan> my favorite movie, don't kill bill
[0:42:18] <BunnyEmperor> DON'T kill bill 2
[0:42:21] <%AncelDeLambert> so, trapper sucks STILL indoors
[0:42:21] <xWanderingFlame> Ocelot
[0:42:22] <Nomad_Scholar> Don't do the thing the Bride did
[0:42:23] <$insaneintentionsyo> are ya winnin, son?
[0:42:24] <%Mendin> Not like oyou could kill Bill anyway
[0:42:25] <%Starotter70> We watching Kill Bill?
[0:42:25] <%Movemeister> Pat is... The Widow
[0:42:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do not use the Five fingered exploding death punch
[0:42:28] <narusao> kill bill? i loved that movie!
[0:42:34] <%GrumblePlays> man, the Lery's rework made it look so much better
[0:42:37] <%DappercatEsquire> need headphones badly
[0:42:40] <%VashyronM> I don't play DBD, why don't you want to kill the Obessession target?
[0:42:42] <%tumzfestival> I thought you were talking about the X rated "THIS AINT Kill Bill"
[0:42:50] <+gildedangel> !specs
[0:42:55] <olaksi> Big whiffs
[0:43:11] <%GrumblePlays> @VashyronM he gets a speed bonus of his actions if he doesn't hit the obsession
[0:43:12] <+CptCreampuff16> i never played this whats up with the scratches all over the place
[0:43:13] <BunnyEmperor> juked
[0:43:15] <%Movemeister> LUL
[0:43:24] <%GrumblePlays> @CptCreampuff16 shows where the survivors have ran
[0:43:28] <%DappercatEsquire> "I didn't even want to kill her"
[0:43:32] <%VashyronM> @GrumblePlays Ah. Thanks!
[0:43:36] <+witchdoctornatyli> remember to lead those shots the gun isnt hit scan
[0:43:37] <+Kennentebest> I imagine this game can be rough to stream because one little mistake can cost you the game as killer
[0:43:38] <@SSaryn> THE JUKES
[0:43:45] <%Jekado> these are some slow bullets
[0:43:46] <reavingd00m> what a nathanGodstiny
[0:43:47] <+secondsigma> Is it fun to soloe queue in DBD?
[0:43:48] <$Wafflum> They leave it behind for a few seconds while sprinting only
[0:43:52] <zeif00> Red Ranks+SWF SeemsGood
[0:43:53] <+Qsmash_> Is there more than one killer usually?
[0:44:00] <illtima> is your entire schtick just having a gun??
[0:44:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CptCreampuff16 when you are killer you see scratches when survivors run
[0:44:06] <MrSyne> oh wow this map seems awful for deathslinger.
[0:44:06] <%GrumblePlays> @secondsigma depends on the players you get

[0:47:44] <Dingalow> That scream she does when getting hooked sounds so weird
[0:47:44] <%GrumblePlays> inb4 Kate accuses you of tunnelling her
[0:47:52] <OvaltineDream> Lööps
[0:47:52] <BrachyZoid> Leave them hanging
[0:47:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why does pat not kick the generators?
[0:48:00] <+GhostDude> All killers are hook ers LUL

[0:48:25] <%GrumblePlays> i was gonna say, remember Bill

[0:48:49] <Thewoodentree> NOT ENOUGH COATS TO HIND UNDER
[0:48:50] <BrachyZoid> That's one itchy trigger finger
[0:48:54] <%Sora20030c> does shooting them with the hook bring down your STBFL stacks?
[0:48:58] <zeif00> Greedy probably
[0:48:58] <dinnydanny777> Your gun seems really bad
[0:49:00] <%Birdigalore> Cuz they baby potatoes
[0:49:01] <+SlightlySychotic> Goodbye Kate
[0:49:03] <%dekkitout> Because?
[0:49:10] <%Sora20030c> iirc shooting someone still injures them but doesn't decrease your stacks
[0:49:11] <%lethallunacyx> Hit gen you fool
[0:49:14] <Ipsenscastle> That looked super goof
[0:49:18] <%dekker21> So is this the COD monster?
[0:49:19] <%AncelDeLambert> HAHAHA
[0:49:22] <BunnyEmperor> needs more ragdoll
[0:49:25] <Dingalow> Probably thought you were shooting at someone else
[0:49:28] <$Wafflum> If they had both kept healing they could have gotten her before you reloaded, but they didn't. Commit or don't
[0:49:44] <+witchdoctornatyli> windows are your best friend as this killer
[0:49:49] <+CptCreampuff16> watching this makes me miss deathgarden
[0:49:52] <rissaleigh14> Yeah sometimes you need to commit super hard in this game
[0:49:53] <+BobBaudoin> Aw heck yes pat's playing DbD
[0:49:58] <californaya> goteem
[0:50:01] <BunnyEmperor> grabbed by the butt
[0:50:01] <StripesUltimateEdition> no DS surprisingly
[0:50:06] <%MelBrooksKA> Do they have a way to get the scratches off?
[0:50:09] <%Kaji04> i see them getting off the hook like nothing, what's the win condition?
[0:50:09] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I haven't played DBD in a hot minite.... kinda almost wanna go back to it but I have so much on my slate already
[0:50:16] <%Sora20030c> they disappear over time
[0:50:16] <%arancet> i'm not sure this is my type of game but i'd give it a try if it were like $5 or something
[0:50:21] <%Sora20030c> there is perks that decrease how long they are there for
[0:50:25] <srkAres> man, pat is great at murdering women
[0:50:28] <%GrumblePlays> NICE

[0:50:46] <j0ustar> Pat be a killer
[0:50:47] <+mikesapartment> god pat murdering people is so hot
[0:50:48] <MrSyne> I kinda want to see Pat play this against some of the RT people. He would murder them very hard.
[0:51:29] <%dekker21> Anyone else's Twitch freezing on their side? i keep having to pause and play
[0:51:50] <%Birdigalore> OOF
[0:51:51] <%MelBrooksKA> One weird trick, survivors hate it

[0:52:23] <$luckypineapple> Definite swf group
[0:52:24] <dinnydanny777> Who was that character
[0:52:25] <%Movemeister> Just that start ruined you
[0:52:27] <%TheActuallyGuy> Do you have an overlay that puts you at the top left of the screen. So we can see the generators?
[0:52:33] <rissaleigh14> Pretty good for first game
[0:52:34] <%Shady_Squid> So is the killer pat's playing on based on anything?
[0:52:38] <%Birdigalore> Yeah they super gen rushed ya
[0:52:39] <californaya> I love watching people play this, I would probably hate playing it
[0:52:45] <$Wafflum> Not bad for not having played a while on a map that's terrible for you
[0:52:47] <ShichiNoBushi> I read that as "Rift Fragment Poggers".
[0:52:48] <+BobBaudoin> Friggin SAME naya

[0:52:54] <%GrumblePlays> BASEMENT BUBBA LESGO
[0:52:54] <vvitchguy> Good shot through the window.
[0:52:55] <Silly_Duckling> The STRONGEST
[0:52:55] <Deadmanslegacy> are there any left 4 dead monsters in this?
[0:52:56] <%Typhaeon> Terrible killer, best Brutality in MK10
[0:52:57] <viewtifulr> oh boy perks
[0:52:58] <californaya> I did some time in Friday the 13th and other people killed the game for me, so
[0:52:59] <+BobBaudoin> I love watching other folks play it lmao
[0:53:00] <HarraceHarrison> Bubba is top tier
[0:53:01] <%TrollKing96> I'm kinda getting Caleb from Blood vibes from the gun killer.
[0:53:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> DELET TTHIZ
[0:53:06] <BunnyEmperor> i smokes the meats
[0:53:10] <rissaleigh14> Oh boy
[0:53:11] <%Sora20030c> bubba is worse hillbilly
[0:53:14] <zeif00> He's not terrible, he's just incredibly plain
[0:53:15] <%Sora20030c> he cant even sprint
[0:53:21] <$luckypineapple> Bubba is almost as bad as Clown or Demo
[0:53:24] <MrNoobMcSalt> ha ha chainsaw go brrrrr
[0:53:26] <DracaenaLeaf> Baba is killer
[0:53:28] <%Sora20030c> (i still like bubba tho)
[0:53:28] <+BobBaudoin> Bubba is you
[0:53:29] <%atgithursdays> Did I miss Triangle Man?
[0:53:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Sora20030c Can't even....sprint
[0:53:34] <%Shady_Squid> He's got a nice little tie tho
[0:53:35] <%GrumblePlays> can confirm, every time i play against a Bubba it's a terrible experience
[0:53:38] <%GrumblePlays> so much camping
[0:53:42] <%Sora20030c> yeah hillbilly can chainsaw dash
[0:53:42] <%Keyd00d> Bubba is stop
[0:53:43] <+Qsmash_> Pleather Face
[0:53:44] <%rideroftraps1> Billy is top tier
[0:53:46] <Romantic_Legion> Freddy is real top tier.
[0:53:48] <HarraceHarrison> Hillbilly can't even down 4 people at once, checkmate hillbilltheists
[0:53:50] <%MajorCrasher> Bubba is awful. his perks are the only good part of his kit
[0:53:52] <rissaleigh14> Yep Bubbas seem to be campers
[0:53:53] <+moistborne> is the demogorgon any good?
[0:53:55] <%Keyd00d> You is Bubba
[0:54:06] <%Typhaeon> But B U B B A
[0:54:07] <armchairmaster_> Bubba got outclassed by the character made to HOMAGE him ironmo1REE
[0:54:07] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt what makes you keep coming back to this game?
[0:54:08] <BackwardCap> I heard that Legion was the worst.
[0:54:11] <dinnydanny777> Get in very small corridors
[0:54:18] <%Sora20030c> legion is weird
[0:54:19] <%Dementedpenguin> He's horribly designed as a Killer
[0:54:22] <Thewoodentree> scans
[0:54:24] <Wizdom_Cube> i knew it
[0:54:29] <OvaltineDream> Bubba is you
[0:54:29] <%tumzfestival> it soubds fun
[0:54:32] <$Wafflum> He's decent for learning the game, not much else
[0:54:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> He is one of the best Basement guarders
[0:54:34] <rissaleigh14> Makes sense
[0:54:35] <%Sora20030c> Otzdarva was on like, a 49 win streak with him (win being 4k, 3k if last gets hatch)
[0:54:36] <wyrdboy21121> bubba is underrated imo
[0:54:40] <%Kaji04> which monster is the most monster ass monster?
[0:54:47] <narusao> he's got eraserhead hair
[0:54:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> give him a small hat
[0:54:56] <$Wafflum> Literally make him Hillbilly LUL
[0:54:57] <vvitchguy> This is the Dark Souls of Evolve games.
[0:54:59] <%tumzfestival> ^^^
[0:54:59] <%sniffy77> give him a machine gun fuck it
[0:55:00] <+mikesapartment> delete him
[0:55:02] <$thesickestzak> Pls buff leather face
[0:55:02] <%tumzfestival> hat
[0:55:07] <%PirateMike_> I thought that cowboy guy was The Saint of Killers
[0:55:11] <Ericgi231> I usually have Bubba hook one person then stand licking their feet until they bleed out
[0:55:12] <HarraceHarrison> TWO chainsaw
[0:55:12] <BackwardCap> Instead of downing, his chainsaw Mori's you
[0:55:13] <Thewoodentree> he needs a make up power up
[0:55:17] <+TestAnon> give him a gun
[0:55:18] <%sniffy77> make leatherface a hillbilly skin
[0:55:29] <%Raiden_Breaker> chainsaw juggling
[0:55:29] <%Dementedpenguin> Hillbilly was Leatherface, then they got the licensed to Bubba, so that screwed him up LUL
[0:55:33] <rissaleigh14> Merge them into one beast
[0:55:34] <%Bailey__gaming> @th3smartalec tiny hat on the chainsaw too
[0:55:36] <%tumzfestival> From TX can confirm there are people who don't wear masks that are scarier than leatherface.
[0:55:36] <BrachyZoid> Leatherface is so awful to go against
[0:55:44] <%GarbageNirvana> It's the weirdest thing having ersatz characters and the actual licensed characters in the same game
[0:55:50] <EmpyreanMAULER> maybe give him something passive for the hooks
[0:55:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Bailey__gaming fuck it, let's get Chainsawman in here
[0:56:01] <EmpyreanMAULER> since idk...he hooked people in the movie
[0:56:02] <+SlightlySychotic> Bubba would be 300% better if he didn’t stop in place for five seconds every time he bumped into something while chainsawing.
[0:56:03] <%tumzfestival> The actor who played the OG leatherface was giant sweetheart.
[0:56:09] <pth88> Can we see some pyramid head gameplay?
[0:56:15] <%GrumblePlays> no
[0:56:15] <narusao> needs a hello kitty picture on his smock
[0:56:16] <rissaleigh14> Yeah he seems super hard to control once he’s charged up
[0:56:16] <%Sora20030c> PH isnt out yet
[0:56:18] <armchairmaster_> Maybe have Leatherface's chainsaw insta-break pallets during its' swinging?
[0:56:22] <%PirateMike_> Thats a long ass "searching for match"
[0:56:24] <%Sora20030c> it does
[0:56:25] <pth88> Oh
[0:56:28] <%Bailey__gaming> @th3smartalec oops all chainsawe
[0:56:31] <BunnyEmperor> there is pyramide head in this game?
[0:56:35] <%Sora20030c> it just stops the chainsaw
[0:56:36] <%Starotter70> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[0:56:39] <EmpyreanMAULER> it does instabreak pallets
[0:56:40] <%nofestu2> da bb
[0:56:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Maybe give him an anti-pallette manuver? where he can sorta throw it and it breaks the pallette faster and potentially hit and damage a survivor
[0:56:47] <+Kennentebest> @BunnyEmperor in like 2 weeks
[0:56:48] <%damienlunas> psaPorgmo
[0:56:49] <+TestAnon> how about stacking buffs when he hooks someone though that's probably in the game
[0:56:51] <%Kaji04> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[0:56:51] <%weissguard> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo He SCREM psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[0:56:53] <Wizdom_Cube> that sucks
[0:56:55] <$luckypineapple> June 16th!
[0:56:56] <$thesickestzak> Does this have cross platform multiplayer?
[0:56:57] <%Dementedpenguin> The best thing about Leatherface is his one perk, sadly. LUL
[0:56:57] <MrNoobMcSalt> F
[0:56:58] <dinnydanny777> What have these people done to be chased by Pyramid Head
[0:56:58] <%tumzfestival> BABEH SCREM
[0:57:01] <ThorgrimFunhammer> emlo scremlo
[0:57:01] <%Kataguro> Kill him
[0:57:04] <%TheActuallyGuy> KILL HIM
[0:57:04] <NoirePanzer> Is this the Elden Ring stream? Pog
[0:57:04] <%Typhaeon> Bruh
[0:57:04] <+Vegaburd> you got me playing runeterra again you fuck
[0:57:06] <%tumzfestival> NOTED
[0:57:06] <%GrumblePlays> hell, even getting rid of the bumping into everythingwould improce
[0:57:09] <%Starotter70> How do you do, fellow Streamers?
[0:57:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> how do you do, fellow streamer
[0:57:11] <Deadmanslegacy> it would be awesome to see a blood drunk hunter from bloodborne as a killer.
[0:57:13] <VJdarkworld> can we see pyramid head kiss the nurse?
[0:57:14] <rissaleigh14> They gotta balance him first
[0:57:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Starotter70 dammit
[0:57:20] <armchairmaster_> I got it pat: THROWABLE HAMMER. Bonk people across the map
[0:57:22] <XdaXcaptainX> i hate ttv names so much
[0:57:26] <Mortal_Wombat_I> A hunter must hunt...
[0:57:26] <Silly_Duckling> Palettes are like the only way for a survivor to keep a killer at bay. If you take that away, things get weird.
[0:57:28] <%Starotter70> @Th3SmartAlec Gotcha
[0:57:28] <HarraceHarrison> Bubba is a good boy
[0:57:36] <dinnydanny777> Why is the flying bed not in the game
[0:57:39] <%Typhaeon> That's not even a valid URL is it
[0:57:45] <%GrumblePlays> for me, putting your twitch name in your steam name is asking for trouble
[0:57:52] <%Birdigalore> Maybe give Leatherboi some additional power that works with the hook, since meat hooks are kind of a big deal in Chainsaw Massacre
[0:57:55] <%wjones0415> what is leatherface's perk?
[0:57:58] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Spydurman) (warning)
[0:57:58] <Deadmanslegacy> flying bed?
[0:58:02] <%tumzfestival> did they add ttv? did they add it to their twitch/! ???
[0:58:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:58:08] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:58:09] <zeif00> TTV people are usually super spicy in post game chat
[0:58:10] <%Typhaeon> I guess if Twitch had a subdomain URL shortener and some ICANN exemption it would work
[0:58:10] <%DappercatEsquire> Spite the competition, Pat
[0:58:13] <%Typhaeon> But nope
[0:58:13] <rissaleigh14> Ttv people are usually horrible to play with

[0:58:52] <BunnyEmperor> Unga Bunga
[0:58:53] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> AEUG_Ace_Kamille subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! Apparently I can say another sub message for some reason. How's things Pat? Still good. Stay cool, Pat.
[0:58:56] <%TrafficCohen> It's a fucking Tuscan Raider
[0:58:58] <%Sora20030c> i think spark plug?
[0:58:59] <%dekkitout> He's got the voice of an angel
[0:59:00] <%tumzfestival> Elmo doesn't mean it tho he's a silly boy
[0:59:00] <VJdarkworld> i mean, ive seen cats turn off computers on stream before......
[0:59:02] <HarraceHarrison> Do you have Caurburator tuning guide?
[0:59:05] <+GhostDude> iM tTv BtW BabyRage
[0:59:06] <%Sora20030c> that too
[0:59:21] <+evbites> why not just switch the hillbilly and Lf's movesets
[0:59:28] <%PirateMike_> I looked up a guy that killed me in a game with a twitch name and their stream was complete garbage to the point I wondered why he bothered
[0:59:30] <BunnyEmperor> that last hit slowdown sucks
[0:59:35] <%tumzfestival> Skin Your Ass Raw
[0:59:40] <%Sora20030c> some tips for that, breath down their neck before you start charging
[0:59:45] <%Birdigalore> oof
[0:59:45] <%Sora20030c> otherwise you wont hit
[0:59:46] <%Mister_McDerp> oof
[0:59:49] <%Starotter70> But Chainsaw go brrrr
[0:59:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> That voice LUL
[0:59:51] <blackbaron98> Break somthing
[0:59:53] <ZeeJiggle> You really just gotta be on their ass once you start revving.
[0:59:59] <%dekkitout> Do the swings give you foward momentum?
[1:00:00] <%GrumblePlays> I've only rage quit DBD once on stream and that was because i was getting clowned by a 4-man flashlight-clicking SWF as wraith
[1:00:14] <%tumzfestival> give pat sumthin to BREAK
[1:00:21] <%Typhaeon> Those swing animations have no sense of momentum
[1:00:21] <%Sora20030c> the only thing that can make bubba good is mind gaming with your saw
[1:00:26] <%GrumblePlays> like, playing killer is bad enough on it's own
[1:00:28] <zeif00> Yeah but charging it up slows you right?
[1:00:33] <%DesertPenguin> Get 'em!
[1:00:34] <SomeOtherNeb> ah yes, bright blue hair, the sneakiest of hairs
[1:00:35] <%gluemanofficial> Blue hair makes it really easy to get spotted

[1:00:43] <HarraceHarrison> Usually they don't ditch Shack like that
[1:00:43] <rissaleigh14> Yeah I feel for people playing killer sometimes

[1:00:45] <FirearmsInstructor> potastHi chat! himepePAT himepeMOKKE
[1:00:49] <ZeeJiggle> Ye, charging it slows you down and you have to ramp the speed back up once you start swinging
[1:00:49] <%PirateMike_> Reminds me of that dude that was threatening protestors with a chainsaw
[1:00:51] <XdaXcaptainX> wow that was the worst play ive ever seen in killer shack by a survivir
[1:00:54] <blackbaron98> @tumzfestival I was watching the woodstock99 show the other day. That song is when white people peaked lol
[1:01:05] <XdaXcaptainX> they just let themselves die
[1:01:07] <%GrumblePlays> that Ace outfit is gross
[1:01:10] <SomeOtherNeb> LUL
[1:01:13] <+theTasdingo> please dont use the word spaz :(
[1:01:18] <%tumzfestival> @blackbaron98 It really kinda is. Ima whisper you something if you dont mind
[1:01:24] <%Fooguwu> :(
[1:01:29] <FirearmsInstructor> Wait why is the hook gold / yellow?
[1:01:31] <FirearmsInstructor> Some perk?
[1:01:36] <%Sora20030c> nah its base
[1:01:38] <%riantDeliration> the amount of clowning survivors can pull is why i never really picked this game up, i know id just get really frustrated. kinda fun to watch at least
[1:01:42] <%Sora20030c> if someone is hooked it glows yellow for you
[1:01:46] <%GrumblePlays> just shows that a survivor is on the hook
[1:01:46] <Silly_Duckling> best bet is to literally just get right up on them before revving, taking the m1 if they're near a window.
[1:01:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> noice
[1:01:54] <%Typhaeon> Sweet
[1:01:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @Sora20030c thanks. Is that an ability or all the time?
[1:02:03] <%Sora20030c> all the time for all killers
[1:02:05] <%PirateMike_> what is this sort of hammer even for
[1:02:09] <rissaleigh14> Does chainsaw improve range a bit at least?
[1:02:15] <Silly_Duckling> Not really DEEP gameplay, but yeah
[1:02:15] <SomeOtherNeb> why does she sound like Paige trying to play DS2?
[1:02:23] <$serpenttucker> Is gremlins considered a horror property?
[1:02:23] <%Sora20030c> there are addons that do that, but they suck
[1:02:26] <zeif00> Might as well pressure gens
[1:02:26] <%Sora20030c> it just makes you hit walls more often
[1:02:29] <%Starotter70> Does she also have balls in her ass?
[1:02:39] <%Fooguwu> @SomeOtherNeb oh wow she does lol
[1:02:39] <%Typhaeon> What.
[1:02:39] <+evbites> you know what would be cool if they added scooby doo characters
[1:02:46] <+MrFancy_Pants487> @MrFancy_Pants487 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:02:51] <dinnydanny777> You should be able to throw the hammer
[1:02:53] <%Bailey__gaming> @evbites Jinkies what a good idea
[1:03:02] <+GenesisKnight> Dude's got the jukes
[1:03:03] <armchairmaster_> Wait...that MISSED?
[1:03:03] <PanicSwytch> I hate the sound fx when they get hooked. It sounds like a wet fart
[1:03:05] <HarraceHarrison> Yeah the last swing has no hitbox
[1:03:11] <%PirateMike_> F
[1:03:12] <zeif00> I think tilting down slightly extends the chainsaw hit box a bit yeah?
[1:03:20] <Thewoodentree> chainsaw beaten by logs, how ironic
[1:03:21] <%PlagueOfGripes> that's Dead by Daylight in clip form
[1:03:21] <%weissguard> That's horseshit.
[1:03:21] <%Starotter70> oh
[1:03:30] <rissaleigh14> Oof
[1:03:35] <%GrumblePlays> did they ever fix grabs btw?
[1:03:35] <%PlagueOfGripes> run in circles around this small spot for 5 minutes, idiots
[1:03:39] <armchairmaster_> At least you have the power of BONK to smack survivors
[1:03:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:03:45] <+evbites> don't know what the killer could be
[1:03:50] <%dekkitout> All the which is to Benny Hill chase music
[1:03:52] <ZeeJiggle> Feels Bubba
[1:03:52] <FirearmsInstructor> what is happening
[1:03:59] <BunnyEmperor> yeah this is not great
[1:04:01] <%Typhaeon> Well that's 3
[1:04:04] <SomeOtherNeb> chainsaw go BRRRRRR
[1:04:06] <ezack4> pat is so n00b.....
[1:04:10] <$thesickestzak> Reee reeee reeee
[1:04:12] <%baronblank> never played the game, but holy crap that chainsaw looks like garbage
[1:04:13] <Silly_Duckling> which lets you m1 if you need to
[1:04:15] <%Mendin> That's 3?
[1:04:17] <Thewoodentree> when in doubt, cut their knee caps out
[1:04:18] <%spitelite> git good
[1:04:22] <ChoculaUltra> I wish I knew how to play any killer competently tbh
[1:04:25] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Kkigomm heart2Jumjum
[1:04:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> gettttem
[1:04:32] <%PlagueOfGripes> DbD is a very stressful game
[1:04:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[1:04:37] <ZeeJiggle> Unluckers.
[1:04:41] <BunnyEmperor> wow thats punishing
[1:04:41] <ChoculaUltra> some killers make it look so easy!
[1:04:45] <SomeOtherNeb> JUKED
[1:04:46] <%Shady_Squid> wow
[1:04:48] <Keeeney> @Keeeney is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:04:49] <%nofestu2> that a fuck
[1:04:50] <ezack4> ???????????
[1:04:51] <%dekkitout> Tell ya hwut
[1:04:52] <ZeeJiggle> This Nea prolly has DS
[1:04:56] <rissaleigh14> I’m absolute trash at killer, fair play to anyone that clan play them
[1:04:57] <FirearmsInstructor> ok I didn't even SEE her against the gen there LUL
[1:04:58] <ZeeJiggle> No? Wow.
[1:04:58] <%weissguard> I gotta respect it.
[1:05:02] <ZeeJiggle> They just rly wanted the gen
[1:05:06] <HarraceHarrison> Surpised she didn't have Decisive Strike
[1:05:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> Gen Wunners
[1:05:12] <%wjones0415> seriously!? leatherface is crap!
[1:05:13] <SomeOtherNeb> seriously 3 of them near the old hangspot?
[1:05:13] <%Sora20030c> as a killer, sometimes you just got to respect the husle of the survivors
[1:05:16] <%Sora20030c> *hustle
[1:05:19] <zeif00> These guys are def SWF
[1:05:21] <%Typhaeon> These guys are well organized
[1:05:23] <%PlagueOfGripes> they did a good job of repairing those mid gens early
[1:05:25] <$thesickestzak> Is this the Dark Souls of asymmetrical multiplayer games?
[1:05:27] <Irkallu> How do people actually die in this game? They have to bleed out on the hook?
[1:05:28] <%GrumblePlays> Killer is way more stressful than survivor
[1:05:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> solid
[1:05:34] <FirearmsInstructor> nice lol
[1:05:34] <ZeeJiggle> Ye woulda been good to just get rid of it at that point.
[1:05:34] <%Birdigalore> All SWF, all day for ol' Pat
[1:05:37] <%Typhaeon> Chainsaw actually doing work
[1:05:39] <BunnyEmperor> why does he keep going LUL
[1:05:39] <%Dementedpenguin> @thesickestzak I mean, you joke, but.... Kappa
[1:05:40] <rissaleigh14> 3 hooks kill them
[1:05:41] <%PirateMike_> Fun fact, Deadlight, Dying Light, and Dead by Daylight are three different games!
[1:05:42] <ZeeJiggle> God damn, they're workin
[1:05:42] <+ShinyBisharp1> @PatStaresAt if i get this game should i just get all the dlc or try and get it for free?
[1:05:44] <+GenesisKnight> It'd be nice if you could cancel that after a hit
[1:05:45] <SomeOtherNeb> you and this girl are on some Benny Hill bullshit
[1:05:46] <rissaleigh14> Or moris
[1:06:10] <$thesickestzak> @dementedpenguin LUL
[1:06:15] <seclusivechain1> is pyramid head already in thig game? or did they only announce him?
[1:06:19] <%Jhylla81> I miss having a good pc because this game looks fun
[1:06:27] <ChoculaUltra> he'll be out soon, he was on the PTS
[1:06:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Get his ass
[1:06:38] <ZeeJiggle> @seclusivechain1 Not yet.
[1:06:39] <%PirateMike_> You don't need a good PC for this shit
[1:06:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:06:41] <ZeeJiggle> Nah, DS was changed a bit ago to kick in right when you get picked up, so you can't juggle them anymore.
[1:06:42] <Silly_Duckling> @Irkallu You have a meter when hooked, if it runs out, you die. Each time you're hooked after the first, it gets reduced by half its max, so you can get hooked twice, third time is death
[1:06:42] <%PlagueOfGripes> haha
[1:06:44] <%DappercatEsquire> why do all these damn college kids keep killing themselves on your property?
[1:06:46] <%Birdigalore> womp womp
[1:06:48] <%Treuan> Almost
[1:06:49] <%weissguard> That was close.
[1:06:50] <Ujean917> YEA YEA YEA YEA
[1:06:51] <BunnyEmperor> DISPLEASED
[1:06:51] <+Westlemania26> Oh god dammit
[1:06:53] <reavingd00m> what a shit character
[1:06:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Entities Mad x24
[1:06:58] <%Dementedpenguin> @thesickestzak let's just say there has yet to be a game similar to DBD that has done it "better" so far
[1:07:00] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Whats your stance on camping a hooked victim
[1:07:02] <+MorphinePandaa> why no chainsaw
[1:07:02] <%PirateMike_> Pat bad at video game
[1:07:03] <rissaleigh14> Oof that’s rough
[1:07:05] <%manwithboxonhead> LUL LUL LUL
[1:07:06] <XdaXcaptainX> bubba, more like, bubad
[1:07:08] <+Man_bot64> sbfpSOB sbfpSOB sbfpSOB sbfpSOB
[1:07:09] <%Starotter70> I dunno, wanna do another round with him?
[1:07:10] <ChoculaUltra> @PatStaresAt how's your Michael Myers game?
[1:07:12] <%PlagueOfGripes> It tried to make me play the same ritual as Nurse that it made me do the day prior
[1:07:13] <%TrafficCohen> @PatStaresAt What's your favourite killer?
[1:07:13] <%sniffy77> Who is the best
[1:07:18] <%GrumblePlays> camping is a no no
[1:07:20] <ZeeJiggle> Only do it if you got nothin else
[1:07:23] <Thewoodentree> lol
[1:07:25] <+WarbossMetal> No pyramid head? :<
[1:07:26] <SGrim> Pig is significantly worse than Bubba
[1:07:26] <SomeOtherNeb> as it should, it's anti-fun
[1:07:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> This Assassin's Creed character looks nuts
[1:07:27] <%Birdigalore> Only do it when you know someone is lag cheating cuz fuck them
[1:07:29] <EmpyreanMAULER> the thing is, you have to know when to chainsaw and when to whack with hammer
[1:07:30] <Silly_Duckling> I mean, bubba's better than pig
[1:07:31] <dinnydanny777> Don't camp like a CoD player
[1:07:36] <%gluemanofficial> I hate how the points system is just "dont play the game optimally"
[1:07:39] <rissaleigh14> Also not fun to watch camping on stream
[1:07:40] <MonstarGrrrl> oink oink
[1:07:41] <zeif00> Surveillance is pretty good
[1:07:42] <FirearmsInstructor> How does it fuck up points?
[1:07:42] <Thewoodentree> Its immoral to camp when mass murdering
[1:07:42] <HarraceHarrison> Boop Snooting time
[1:07:43] <SomeOtherNeb> oh no it's Pat's mom
[1:07:49] <%Typhaeon> Not fat eough
[1:07:55] <EmpyreanMAULER> as bad as you wanna get those insta downs and complete daily rituals
[1:07:57] <Silly_Duckling> not by much, but still
[1:07:59] <zeif00> Make your Choice too
[1:08:01] <ZeeJiggle> Surveillance + Ruin is a good combo till Ruin dies
[1:08:04] <$thesickestzak> When are they adding Jack Frost?
[1:08:09] <%GrumblePlays> ruin LUL
[1:08:14] <%Kataguro> Spies
[1:08:14] <%Typhaeon> Rawhead Rex when
[1:08:17] <%Typhaeon> No, seriously
[1:08:20] <%Birdigalore> But Hex:Ruin is so good! It slows the game down...just a little bit!
[1:08:22] <HarraceHarrison> Sloppy is good
[1:08:30] <%DappercatEsquire> She got a stinger?
[1:08:31] <%weissguard> However...?
[1:08:36] <Starotter70> When are they adding Birds!? psaCaw
[1:08:38] <FirearmsInstructor> Is this the reverse-bear trap helmet killer?
[1:08:38] <rissaleigh14> Remember when ruin was the standard for killers?
[1:08:39] <%PirateMike_> huh didn't expect "The Pig"to be a woman
[1:08:39] <%YakumoYomi> @thesickestzak Will he shout "Hi-ho!" at survivors?
[1:08:41] <EmpyreanMAULER> surveillance and ruin is a good combo indeed
[1:08:42] <@SoFarFetched> @FirearmsInstructor I assume camping fucks up points so it helps prevent a lot of bad games. Though I assume theres people who don't care about points.
[1:08:45] <+ausl0> Range on her dash is pretty big
[1:08:45] <%weissguard> Oof.
[1:08:51] <%ElkRiverDog> !uptime
[1:08:51] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 8m.
[1:08:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PirateMike_ ...
[1:08:58] <Captain_Doomsday> Sloppy's a staple, but Pig can't apply effects on lunge attacks, right?
[1:08:59] <%PlagueOfGripes> also she looks stupid!
[1:09:00] <%Jhylla81> I never saw any of the Saw movies past 3
[1:09:04] <+patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Have you seen the movie "The Ritual"? Creepiest monster design in recent history imo
[1:09:07] <%BubbaRands> OH SNAP WE PLAYIN DEVIL GAMES
[1:09:09] <%DappercatEsquire> She has the hidden blade
[1:09:14] <rissaleigh14> That snoot though
[1:09:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched hey man. Yeah I guess that makes sense. Seen a few hours of this game, but never played.
[1:09:19] <Silly_Duckling> Reverse bear traps can range from "a nice addition" to "a complete waste of time" so there's that
[1:09:19] <EmpyreanMAULER> sloppy only works for basic
[1:09:19] <%Birdigalore> This pig is no nearly sexy enough
[1:09:20] <+evbites> and apparently she is apart of the assassins
[1:09:21] <%PlagueOfGripes> she's from one of the assassin's creed games right
[1:09:22] <+captain_elsewhere> the way to negate the slowness of her sneak is to use wispers so that when whispers lights up you go into sneak and walk around normally
[1:09:22] <%Birdigalore> *not
[1:09:24] <armchairmaster_> Mikey Boy will always stay in my heart
[1:09:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched also ty. Hope you're well
[1:09:28] <+witchdoctornatyli> boop the snoot
[1:09:28] <ZeeJiggle> @PlagueOfGripes Ye
[1:09:34] <+SlightlySychotic> Oink!
[1:09:36] <HarraceHarrison> Yeah not for the dash
[1:09:39] <weirdducks> I've seen people do dash mid chase to do mind games
[1:09:41] <wyrdboy21121> sloppy butcher is really good perk
[1:09:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes It has the ubisoft face....but I don't know
[1:09:48] <Captain_Doomsday> BHVR HATES Pig. And Legion, but mostly Pig.
[1:09:50] <%PlagueOfGripes> definitely a black flag character
[1:09:50] <wyrdboy21121> adds 25% more heal time each time
[1:09:53] <$thesickestzak> @yakumoyomi lol I meant the snowman from the movie, but they should totally add that Jack Frost as well!
[1:09:54] <wyrdboy21121> so it adds up
[1:09:55] <Wondabarrapa> would recommend wraith
[1:10:04] <Deadmanslegacy> isn't that from saw?
[1:10:05] <rekinom> She's from Assassin's Creed: Brotherhog
[1:10:06] <EmpyreanMAULER> ruin pat, trust. surveillance and ruin will help you apply that gen pressure
[1:10:09] <%DappercatEsquire> It's Diogenes in disguise
[1:10:13] <%GrumblePlays> wraith is good for low ranks
[1:10:15] <zeif00> Wraith is super add-on dependent
[1:10:18] <Silly_Duckling> wraith is a great starter killer
[1:10:18] <+captain_elsewhere> wraith uses a different playstyle than 90% of the killers
[1:10:33] <Captain_Doomsday> Wraith is the worst Stealth killer. He's completely visible in cloak.
[1:10:41] <%Mendin> Wraith with add-ons is Fun. Wraith in a vacuum is eghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:10:42] <%PlagueOfGripes> it's DbD, so you probably won't have all her recommended perks until 40 hours from now. (bicycle horn)
[1:10:46] <armchairmaster_> Should have had her power be reverse shotgun
[1:10:49] <Captain_Doomsday> He's like a faster Myers with no oneshot.
[1:10:55] <rissaleigh14> Did they make any other changes to ruin recently?
[1:10:55] <%Starotter70> psaGib
[1:10:56] <EmpyreanMAULER> surveillance allows you to see when gen is no longer being regressed
[1:10:56] <%YakumoYomi> @thesickestzak I totally forgot that movie was a thing.
[1:11:00] <%DappercatEsquire> Play Runeterra while you wait

[1:11:50] <%Sora20030c> @CptCreampuff16 it depends, later in the night it queues faster
[1:11:53] <%Kataguro> When's Zzat?
[1:11:53] <ShichiNoBushi> We love him the MO-st.
[1:11:53] <EmpyreanMAULER> just pay attention to your ruin too.

[1:11:59] <%Sora20030c> Like, once it hits 10 I get instant queues as killer
[1:11:59] <%BoneofMalkav> Pumpkin Head would be lit for this
[1:12:01] <%vaporousTippler> What, the Great Pumpkin from Peanuts?
[1:12:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Give him a suplex
[1:12:03] <%Typhaeon> Get Pumpkinhead in, get Rex
[1:12:03] <%Bailey__gaming> He Scream
[1:12:04] <underFreddy> Imo they need to work a couple of the killers before adding more
[1:12:05] <%Birdigalore> WHEN'S RAWHEAD REX
[1:12:06] <%thelonechris> When's Ice Cream Man?
[1:12:07] <%atgithursdays> Whens The Thing
[1:12:07] <count_bob> So I heard a really good argument the other day.
[1:12:09] <+captain_elsewhere> the way to play wraith at high levels is to hit someone, make them drop a pallet, break it find another person, uses nurses calling to find people healing outpositioned
[1:12:09] <+BobBaudoin> MEOW moon2E
[1:12:09] <rissaleigh14> The Pumpkin
[1:12:10] <%GrumblePlays> pumpkinhead would be a cool killer to reveal at halloween
[1:12:11] <californaya> THE ONLY THING THAT CAN KILL A STREAMER IS ANOTHER STREAMER
[1:12:11] <%Dementedpenguin> I remembered when the devs lied about never going to include a clown killer
[1:12:12] <%dekker21> Whens Jack Skeleton

[1:12:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt BTW since I wasn't here when you read it I still appreicate that you use No Sympy of the night as your Desktop Wallpaper

[1:12:58] <+TraitorousAlf> Why do they all have Dwight Fairfield under their name
[1:13:00] <%TrafficCohen> is DBD free?
[1:13:01] <Armadelus> I was hoping for Pinhead from Hellraiser
[1:13:04] <EmpyreanMAULER> thr rift challenge stuff is based around huntress and legion. easy bp
[1:13:06] <%PlagueOfGripes> Pat's basic bitch style repulses us
[1:13:08] <%BoneofMalkav> The Blob would probably be too OP for DBD LUL
[1:13:09] <%W1nterTitan> 4 dwights
[1:13:10] <%TrafficCohen> KILLER KLOWNS WHEN?
[1:13:13] <Thewoodentree> WHENS LEPRECHAUN (BACK TO DA HOOD) EDITION

[1:13:19] <Skeleton_Boner_Lord> Too many Dwights

[1:13:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> @trafficcohen no, but the base game is on Gamepass.
[1:13:29] <%tumzfestival> PAY FOR A GAME?!
[1:13:30] <+captain_elsewhere> best places for dash attack is short loops but you need to learn how to mindgame by switching directions
[1:13:33] <%spiritofmojave> WHENS THE BAZ
[1:13:37] <$thesickestzak> You can get it on Game Pass
[1:13:38] <%Sora20030c> minus the last two, which I bought on release

[1:13:43] <%TrafficCohen> @rumtumtugnutz Nice to hear
[1:13:43] <thewhiterice92> It’s on sale A LOT tho
[1:13:43] <Captain_Doomsday> I would NEVER recommend DbD at full price. Licensed characters are also paywalled.

[1:13:53] <rissaleigh14> Yeah they’ll want to entice people for the pumpkin
[1:13:53] <+captain_elsewhere> eeew dying light, never use dying light
[1:13:54] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> oooh
[1:13:56] <%Kataguro> Swiggity Swooty
[1:13:57] <dinnydanny777> That is actually a wristblade
[1:14:01] <Andrizzleton> Candyman would be amazing
[1:14:03] <%JaydenSai> DBD is on sale on PSN, if consoles are peoples jam @PatStaresAt
[1:14:03] <%PlagueOfGripes> all the youtube videos about how to play characters start with 20 minutes of talking about perks you don't own
[1:14:06] <Thewoodentree> WHENS JUST REGULAR STEPHEN KING
[1:14:06] <%BoneofMalkav> Better yet, When's Postal Dude? LUL
[1:14:07] <vvitchguy> When's Higgs?
[1:14:08] <%GrumblePlays> Licensed characters are never not gonna be paywalled
[1:14:11] <dinnydanny777> That is actually just an Assassin's Creed knife
[1:14:11] <rekinom> she oink 🐷
[1:14:12] <%Plus_On_Black> The guy from American Psycho?
[1:14:12] <+evbites> WHENS THAT GUY WHO ATE MY LUNCH
[1:14:14] <RootVeggie> I don't like that Heather is in the game because of the implication that she's stuck in a trial of eternal torment
[1:14:15] <BunnyEmperor> ManBearPig
[1:14:15] <%tumzfestival> HIGGS
[1:14:17] <SnaKemuho> why does she roar LUL
[1:14:29] <+Pyrophant> if you spam the ambush attack button, it sounds like youre barking
[1:14:30] <%spiritofmojave> stock roar sounds LUL
[1:14:30] <+witchdoctornatyli> its a sound effect in the movie
[1:14:32] <Ericgi231> She is a lion dressed like a pig
[1:14:32] <%PlagueOfGripes> why is it a lion roar
[1:14:33] <Captain_Doomsday> Because BHVR never watches the movies characters they add are from.
[1:14:34] <%GrumblePlays> the roar is from Saw film
[1:14:34] <SomeOtherNeb> I was gonna get this game but there's over 100 euros of DLC???
[1:14:36] <%DappercatEsquire> @PlagueOfGripes The amount of time investment required to have a competent set up sounds like garbage.
[1:14:37] <%tumzfestival> WHENS CARNOSAUR?
[1:14:37] <%Birdigalore> Cuz she roared in the movie...and it was stupid
[1:14:37] <SomeOtherNeb> jesus
[1:14:39] <%GrumblePlays> I never got it
[1:14:39] <%Dementedpenguin> Weirdly the lion roar was in the movies
[1:14:40] <ohio4987> When's the Hoppin' Hesian from Rocko?
[1:14:41] <zeif00> psaBlind psaBlind
[1:14:41] <jase__x> because they have a pig squeal in the movie
[1:14:44] <+captain_elsewhere> from the movies
[1:14:50] <%dekkitout> Piggies can be quite ferocious
[1:14:51] <Silly_Duckling> probably would just be better off play pig as a MwM
[1:14:53] <%tumzfestival> whens suburban sasquatch
[1:14:57] <%dekkitout> Kings of the mud jungle
[1:14:58] <seclusivechain1> who is your favorite killer to play?
[1:14:58] <%tumzfestival> I KNOW WHY THE LION ROAR
[1:14:59] <%DappercatEsquire> Especially for a PvP game
[1:15:00] <%gluemanofficial> They couldnt get the rights to the pig noise
[1:15:01] <Thewoodentree> cuz jump scare sounds
[1:15:02] <%GrumblePlays> Nah the lion roar is in the first film when the doctor gets grabbed
[1:15:05] <+Excelumin> piggu
[1:15:05] <BunnyEmperor> goldwyn mayer collab
[1:15:07] <%tumzfestival> I actually think I do
[1:15:07] <underFreddy> I've got this map the last four times I played Killer and now Pat gets it as well. So boring
[1:15:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> HUMAN BLANKET
[1:15:18] <SulfurousAcid> piggu is the best wytb
[1:15:19] <%PlagueOfGripes> what's your most hated killer
[1:15:19] <SomeOtherNeb> @gluemanofficial pigs are notoriously litigious
[1:15:20] <Captain_Doomsday> Why...did you play the character you hate?
[1:15:23] <Silly_Duckling> but ya gotta get those dash hits in
[1:15:23] <%Treuan> Good thing everyone is out protesting pigs right now damn gotem
[1:15:26] <%Sora20030c> he has a challenge for them
[1:15:26] <%Dementedpenguin> The Pig has three abilities and still sucks.
[1:15:26] <%GohanHitsugaya> bunbeeOk
[1:15:28] <jase__x> Sucks that it isnt the pig squeal like in the movie
[1:15:28] <%weissguard> Yeah, this walk speed seems frustrating.
[1:15:30] <GameOver_Here> Is Pig from SAW?
[1:15:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Leatherface
[1:15:30] <%Sora20030c> he wants the big currency
[1:15:33] <%Kataguro> Cute
[1:15:37] <Captain_Doomsday> You're playing Dead by Daylight as Killer. You've filled your suffering quota. Also yes she's from SAW.
[1:15:38] <Thewoodentree> to get back up
[1:15:40] <%TrafficCohen> Light kivk
[1:15:40] <%GrumblePlays> Yes, this is the Pig from Saw
[1:15:42] <%PlagueOfGripes> I despise Hag
[1:15:44] <HarraceHarrison> Pig does have the cutest stun sound, so she's top tier
[1:15:46] <%JaydenSai> @GameOver_Here Yep
[1:15:47] <%PlagueOfGripes> er, Nurse
[1:15:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hag can be Broken
[1:15:55] <%GrumblePlays> Playing against Hag sucks because of the constant jumpscares
[1:15:57] <%Sora20030c> I love playing Hag
[1:15:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nurse IS broken
[1:16:01] <SulfurousAcid> hag's playstyle is just kinda boring
[1:16:05] <+Pyrophant> he 100% saw you
[1:16:08] <+witchdoctornatyli> its honestly better to sneak up and m1 them you keep stealth for a second or two you can pull them off gens if they arent paying attention
[1:16:14] <%tumzfestival> I could be wrong, but when they were making the first SAW for like a tiny budget, it was their first movie and they moxed a bunch of animal noises to make the pig abduction scarier even though you don't remember it being in the first movie probably.
[1:16:17] <%PlagueOfGripes> Nurse feels like shit to play despite being both OP and somewhat balanced
[1:16:18] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @GrumblePlays jumpscare mayers laughs maniacally
[1:16:19] <%JaydenSai> I like it when Paige has to deal with Hag
[1:16:26] <%tumzfestival> MIXed
[1:16:32] <rissaleigh14> Depends how aware of their surroundings they are yeah
[1:16:36] <%Kataguro> Swing and a miss
[1:16:38] <HarraceHarrison> Remember trap
[1:16:40] <Captain_Doomsday> Baby Dweet
[1:16:40] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if they just started putting super weird and random characters in the game
[1:16:40] <%DappercatEsquire> whoops
[1:16:41] <%Valdorick> Get dunked on, bro
[1:16:41] <HarraceHarrison> TRAP
[1:16:43] <vvitchguy> Maybe T-1000 would be cool for this game?
[1:16:47] <%Mendin> Dwayno Mars
[1:16:48] <Thewoodentree> fucking hipster
[1:16:49] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> give him a hat
[1:16:50] <zeif00> HAT TIME
[1:16:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> anyone looking for a job send me a whisper, i'll direct ya to some jobs in the video game industry where you might be able to work from home if you are 18+ and in certain areas of the world
[1:16:53] <SulfurousAcid> PARTY HAT
[1:16:54] <+captain_elsewhere> hats zekeFGM
[1:16:59] <%tumzfestival> AROUND THE HAT
[1:17:02] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> free hat!
[1:17:02] <Captain_Doomsday> If you really want to "win", just slug everyone with a trap on them.
[1:17:04] <Thewoodentree> HOWS THIS FOR A FEDORA
[1:17:05] <$personmanthingg> what does that do?
[1:17:05] <HarraceHarrison> But also hook him
[1:17:05] <%Starotter70> What's Pig from?
[1:17:11] <%GrumblePlays> Saw
[1:17:12] <primaryfire> what's this character?
[1:17:13] <%JaydenSai> Saw
[1:17:15] <%TrafficCohen> @Starotter70 Saw
[1:17:15] <%Starotter70> Ah
[1:17:16] <%weissguard> Seems like Pig gets knee-capped if the map isn't a favorable one.
[1:17:16] <%GrumblePlays> Pig
[1:17:19] <$personmanthingg> oh damn
[1:17:20] <zeif00> No hook?
[1:17:20] <%thelonechris> Rips their face apart
[1:17:21] <%Starotter70> Thanks Chat
[1:17:22] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @personmanthingg its a reverse beartrap
[1:17:23] <%PlagueOfGripes> I can never get the hat off
[1:17:27] <Nomad_Scholar> "Let me clean my weapon, something that will get dirty after I use it again."
[1:17:29] <Ujean917> The timer only starts AFTER a generator is finished
[1:17:30] <%PlagueOfGripes> takes too long to RNG it off
[1:17:33] <MrSyne> My problem with this character I was keep thinking how she's just the receptionist from Becker.
[1:17:34] <+abrupt_abe> So Pig wants to juggle traps and hooks?
[1:17:37] <Romantic_Legion> @PatStaresAt Don't you have to hook them first?
[1:17:38] <californaya> That was sick
[1:17:38] <Silly_Duckling> They can remove it by going to certain spots on the map, sometimes it removes it, sometimes it doesn't. RNG
[1:17:40] <%wjones0415> oh man!
[1:17:44] <fluffy_sauce> any way for them to take it off?
[1:17:45] <SomeOtherNeb> HOW
[1:17:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Reverse beartrap device from Saw.
[1:17:49] <+garudapanzer> Hey Pat!!
[1:17:51] <XdaXcaptainX> the head trap hasnt killed anyone over rank 15 sinve 1983
[1:17:51] <%GrumblePlays> i swear it's always the last Saw box you find that'll get the RBT off
[1:17:55] <+Pyrophant> @Romantic_Legion the trap becomes active when a gen is completed
[1:18:00] <lilferniee> the timer doesnt activate until someone completes a gen each time theres a new trap
[1:18:03] <%Mendin> There's four(?) trap boxes on the map that they have to search and the key is in one of t hem
[1:18:05] <%PlagueOfGripes> have to go do a puzzle. and if you win, it may tell you to fuck off and die anyway
[1:18:06] <+Excelumin> they have to go around the map and interact with these trapped boxes, only 1 of the boxes has the key in it tho
[1:18:07] <Captain_Doomsday> The boxes around the level take off the trap, but only one of the three will.
[1:18:08] <rissaleigh14> It’s either the last or first one you find
[1:18:09] <FirearmsInstructor> What's with the black smoke cloud vignetting sometimes?
[1:18:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GrumblePlays that statement is true even if you only get one box
[1:18:15] <+evbites> everything about Pig is so weird
[1:18:17] <PanicSwytch> Can u put a hat on all of them or is there a limited amount?
[1:18:19] <%Mendin> Shows t hat you're in ~~stealth mode~~
[1:18:23] <zeif00> It went white boi
[1:18:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kick then gens pat
[1:18:26] <Captain_Doomsday> Pig can bodyblock the puzzle, too, if you figure out which matters.
[1:18:26] <californaya> do you run faster when the blade is out
[1:18:26] <%tumzfestival> That'd be cool if they could take off the traps by killing eachother, like the movie
[1:18:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @Mendin thanks
[1:18:32] <%GrumblePlays> Also if the RBT is active and you try to leave you die instantly
[1:18:32] <%Owkono> are you winning?
[1:18:33] <Silly_Duckling> AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM
[1:18:33] <rissaleigh14> You can put it on all of them I think
[1:18:41] <+captain_elsewhere> yeah you put a trap on their head then hook them and if a gen is done any time they have the trap on it activates and they have iirc 2 minutes to get it off by messing with the white boxes
[1:18:43] <%Jhylla81> I wish the killer could climb inside that fisher price toy car and chase victims
[1:18:48] <Captain_Doomsday> You run faster while standing, yes. But she doesn't have a giant heartbeat announcing her location crouching.
[1:18:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tumzfestival it would be cool if to remove it you get a debuf for a while
[1:18:53] <EmpyreanMAULER> when the gen is white it regresses. when the gen is yellow, people are working on it
[1:18:59] <Captain_Doomsday> YOOOO Leprechaun with the toy car
[1:19:00] <Anger_Panda> Ezio's pissed
[1:19:08] <%Sora20030c> ghostface is the superior stealth killer
[1:19:12] <dinnydanny777> I want them to put super weird characters in the game
[1:19:14] <%PlagueOfGripes> I have fun as killer when I'm able to consistently do *something* instead of getting stuck in loops or not finding anyone. don't care too much about killing everyone
[1:19:19] <+evbites> Leprechaun or chucky
[1:19:21] <Captain_Doomsday> Ghostface is the strongest Stealth killer in the game.
[1:19:35] <%tumzfestival> @doc_ock_rokc I don't play the game enough to really comment on mechanics, I just like the idea of translating ideas from movies and this game is ripe
[1:19:40] <FirearmsInstructor> How many does he need to stealth jump punch?
[1:19:42] <%Sora20030c> wish I liked playing him, even though he's worse I like playing wraith more
[1:19:43] <$thesickestzak> You should just make a big pit of syringes. That was the best trap in all of the Saw movies.
[1:19:49] <%tumzfestival> RAWHEAD REX
[1:19:51] <%thelonechris> Evil Bong for DBD
[1:19:52] <Captain_Doomsday> Actually, DbD is bad for adaptation because the core mechanics are really limited.
[1:19:53] <%Sora20030c> I also get to ring the bell psaUp
[1:19:54] <+demon1103> So long as 1 person dies, I view it as good enough
[1:19:55] <%Starotter70> I wanna know the Meta behind the Leprechaun's Tricycle
[1:19:57] <armchairmaster_> @captain_doomsday but does he got the big S T A R E ?
[1:19:58] <%GrumblePlays> Low rank killer was fun, when i started playing against higher ranks it got rough
[1:20:04] <ChoculaUltra> I imagine if you don't remove the party hat and go through the exit gate it goes snap?
[1:20:11] <Captain_Doomsday> So everyone is kind of the same, though Killers are getting better.
[1:20:15] <dinnydanny777> "We're allowed to add Silent Hill monsters so I guess now we're adding that flying bed monster from Silent Hill 2"
[1:20:16] <FirearmsInstructor> it doesn't even 1 shot them
[1:20:19] <+shinpete> Ambush seems waay sitautional, it should just knock down
[1:20:21] <rissaleigh14> Yeah you die if you don’t get it off
[1:20:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> Amanda's Creed
[1:20:23] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @ChoculaUltra not all the tome...dont ask why
[1:20:23] <%Sora20030c> once you start going against red ranks the game just gets so stressful as killer man
[1:20:28] <%GrumblePlays> @tumzfestival would Rawhead Rex's power be pissing on the survivors?
[1:20:29] <%Kataguro> Well you have no terror radius
[1:20:30] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> time*
[1:20:31] <ChoculaUltra> d'awww
[1:20:32] <zeif00> No hat?
[1:20:33] <Captain_Doomsday> @armchairmaster_ Michael seems like the most fun character to not-play. Just creep on people all match with.
[1:20:33] <+Pyrophant> no trap?
[1:20:36] <Wondabarrapa> ambush is for mindgaming around pallet loops
[1:20:37] <californaya> yeah, considering how long the charge time is for that, absolutely
[1:20:39] <%Dementedpenguin> High ranks can be rough. I remember going against a team that finished all gens in 3 minutes
[1:20:39] <%PlagueOfGripes> the leap? pretty easy to land though
[1:20:42] <boomstickery> is it really that hard a skillshot?
[1:20:47] <weirdducks> too easy for a down
[1:20:50] <EmpyreanMAULER> get out of range with make your choice and go back to get the rescuer
[1:20:52] <Ericgi231> @ChoculaUltra It only kills you if you try to escape through the gate while it is active
[1:20:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tumzfestival Don't you have to sacrifice a part of yourself to survive jigsawz traps?
[1:20:56] <+captain_elsewhere> im at high levels and i can get dash attacks very reliably and it would be a bit bs
[1:20:59] <Anger_Panda> Dan Ackroyd's character from Nothing But Trouble for DBD
[1:21:02] <garbageheaphound> what character is Pat playing as?
[1:21:05] <$thesickestzak> That would be kinda StinkyCheese
[1:21:05] <%Valdorick> Yeah there was totally someone in there.
[1:21:06] <%GrumblePlays> Pig
[1:21:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Pig
[1:21:07] <Shonen_hero> ayyy
[1:21:09] <Shonen_hero> sup chat
[1:21:10] <%tumzfestival> @doc_ock_rokc That's what I mean by kill a teammate to survive, hehe
[1:21:11] <%JaydenSai> @garbageheaphound Pig
[1:21:13] <garbageheaphound> aight
[1:21:13] <dinnydanny777> "We've added Pyramid Head and now for our next Silent Hill character, here's Dog"
[1:21:14] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat never kicks generators
[1:21:15] <%PlagueOfGripes> like a lot of killers it's more that the moves are awkward af when used, even if they're good and/or balanced
[1:21:20] <SoySocks> @Anger_Panda lol the judge throwing people into the Bone-Stripper
[1:21:22] <jase__x> gotta love that hard to see geometry
[1:21:25] <FirearmsInstructor> @dinnydanny777 PH is in the game?
[1:21:29] <Captain_Doomsday> Kicking gens is often a waste of time without Pop goes the Weasel
[1:21:29] <nockmaar6> did Pat try RE Resistance?
[1:21:29] <+captain_elsewhere> he cant Bane_Kaikyo he has ruin
[1:21:30] <HarraceHarrison> Ruins really good when no one finds it for some reason
[1:21:31] <%tumzfestival> PWAGUE AYAYA
[1:21:35] <%JaydenSai> @FirearmsInstructor As of next week, yes
[1:21:37] <Captain_Doomsday> At least, Otz doesn't kick much.
[1:21:37] <rissaleigh14> PH will be in the game soon
[1:21:39] <dinnydanny777> He will be yeah
[1:21:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @JaydenSai awesome ty
[1:21:47] <%PlagueOfGripes> this poor guy again
[1:21:48] <+SlightlySychotic> The bigger issue is that Spine Chill exists which counters stealth and has no drawbacks.
[1:21:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> Shantae drawing looks great Plague
[1:21:50] <Captain_Doomsday> I HOPE Pat tried REsistance. It's WAY better than DbD.
[1:21:59] <%Kataguro> How did that work

[1:22:01] <Shonen_hero> that was pretty good
[1:22:02] <%gluemanofficial> GOTTEM
[1:22:02] <Wizdom_Cube> nice!
[1:22:03] <%Treuan> NICE
[1:22:04] <%FusRoDom> Clap
[1:22:05] <%R3Roundabout> good one
[1:22:05] <%Mendin> Designated Bait Survivor
[1:22:05] <SGrim> 8.2/10
[1:22:06] <%PlagueOfGripes> either he's feeling victimized right now or he wants to be the sacrifice
[1:22:06] <%Starotter70> Alright
[1:22:06] <%JaydenSai> Good shit
[1:22:07] <underFreddy> Looking at the range and turnability on the dash attack, it seems really good
[1:22:08] <+shinpete> Outplayed PogChamp
[1:22:09] <KingKZ> That was acceptable
[1:22:09] <Captain_Doomsday> Poor baby Dwightus
[1:22:10] <seclusivechain1> Clap
[1:22:10] <+heretostream> PogChamp
[1:22:11] <%Jhylla81> The Thing would be a cool killer. Just make him kinda like the Spy in tf2 with tentacles
[1:22:11] <+GenesisKnight> Just put the hipster out of his misery
[1:22:12] <Shonen_hero> get fucked
[1:22:12] <%Lizard0TM> seems like he let you hit him
[1:22:13] <+captain_elsewhere> thats the best places to use dash attack, those short loops
[1:22:13] <HarraceHarrison> yer traps
[1:22:13] <jase__x> GOOD SHIT
[1:22:13] <viewtifulr> pro plays pat
[1:22:13] <%weissguard> 8/10
[1:22:16] <+evbites> Cujo that dog with super bat rabies would be cool
[1:22:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @PatStaresAt Why no helmet traps?
[1:22:16] <%tumzfestival> AIRHOLED
[1:22:18] <dinnydanny777> How about the guy from the Shining?
[1:22:18] <%nofestu2> horrible
[1:22:21] <garrulousAuthority> can we get some Hellraiser in here
[1:22:22] <Silly_Duckling> The high-end play involves making survivors use palettes a herding them to one side of the map. Without that, games can feel random at times.
[1:22:28] <$thesickestzak> 6/10
[1:22:29] <Thewoodentree> @PlagueOfGripes Thats what he gets for having a pizza key chain
[1:22:29] <+EyeFarted> SHAAAAAAAUUUUUUUNNNNNN!
[1:22:30] <%weissguard> But for real, he probably wants to just be a distraction.
[1:22:30] <Shonen_hero> Man Dead By Daylight has gotten real good
[1:22:32] <+CyroGhostX> 3 out of 5
[1:22:32] <Silly_Duckling> helmet traps are a waste of time
[1:22:33] <%tumzfestival> @dinnydanny777 Nicholson? Jack Torrance?!
[1:22:34] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Expert
[1:22:35] <%Kataguro> Pat, you can put the trap on them and then hook them
[1:22:35] <FirearmsInstructor> Good reason LUL
[1:22:36] <Shonen_hero> I member when this shit was hot trash
[1:22:37] <ChoculaUltra> rip
[1:22:37] <zeif00> Fair
[1:22:38] <dinnydanny777> Yep
[1:22:40] <%ChaosAethr> Pat How would you feel if the Killer got an Enraged State, Where palletes cant stop you
[1:22:45] <%Starotter70> Nic Cage in a Bear Suit as a Survivor
[1:22:47] <%OmegaWeltall> OH if they had Pinhead i'd buy t he FUCK outtta this game Kreygasm
[1:22:54] <rissaleigh14> Yeah that’s fair
[1:22:54] <armchairmaster_> LUL LUL LUL
[1:22:57] <Captain_Doomsday> That guy was on second hook. The closer someone is to dying, the less valuable the trap is, anyway.
[1:22:58] <+BobBaudoin> Pinhead would be AMAZING
[1:23:03] <mrblack499> head gear for late game
[1:23:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ChaosAethr Oni
[1:23:05] <BackwardCap> One thing this game likes to do is lock what should be balance adjustments behind add-ons.
[1:23:06] <+Excelumin> @ChaosAethr that's what Jason would have if he were in DBD instead of F13
[1:23:06] <%tumzfestival> If they made The Shining a horror game, it should feel like PT.
[1:23:08] <$thesickestzak> When are we getting the evil hand for Idle Hands?
[1:23:09] <+razielhex> Praise Sigmar.
[1:23:09] <+BobBaudoin> The moveset he'd have would be crazy
[1:23:10] <%nofestu2> @starotter70 and he can punch the killer
[1:23:13] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @OmegaWeltall in 15 days pinhead will be in the game
[1:23:14] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat, Kick generators... It degrades their progress
[1:23:15] <%weissguard> Who you callin' Pinhead?
[1:23:16] <%Starotter70> Yes
[1:23:17] <tusk102> how much did i miss? like, how long ago did he actually start gameplay
[1:23:19] <%weissguard> Kappa
[1:23:19] <%OmegaWeltall> "No tears please, its a waste of good suffering"
[1:23:19] <dinnydanny777> I can't wait for them top start scraping the bottom of the barrell though
[1:23:25] <ChoculaUltra> oh man, what about the cane from Citizen Kane
[1:23:27] <%GrumblePlays> It's such a shame about F13
[1:23:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Bane_Kaikyo He is using hex ruin so its already regressing
[1:23:33] <+captain_elsewhere> you got your 4 dash attacks you dont have to worry about getting more
[1:23:34] <%Valdorick> OH NO THAT FOOL
[1:23:37] <HarraceHarrison> Greedy boy dwight
[1:23:39] <%OmegaWeltall> oh word?! @lwpabloelenano2hc
[1:23:40] <%PlagueOfGripes> I was telling Paige the last we talked about it, I wish the game was less about dominating the other team, and finding and downing people was more guaranteed, but without the long hook states of inactivity or total death. more about scoring, less about total victory
[1:23:42] <%tumzfestival> CHARLES FOSTER KANE
[1:23:42] <%Dementedpenguin> Dwights 4Head
[1:23:42] <zeif00> Thought you would respect the palette LUL
[1:23:50] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @OmegaWeltall yeah
[1:23:56] <jase__x> He wants the hit so he can heal
[1:23:56] <%GrumblePlays> F13 is less competitive and more based on survival but it's so... wrong
[1:23:57] <%dekkitout> Queue up the Benny Hill music
[1:23:59] <%OmegaWeltall> oh cool thanks SeemsGood
[1:23:59] <underFreddy> Never Respect Pallets
[1:24:00] <+evbites> if they do pinhead can it be the one from the book cause reasons
[1:24:00] <%Valdorick> Trap Dat head
[1:24:01] <+Pyrophant> traptraptraptraptrap
[1:24:01] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, the pip system is based on points earned, not kills.
[1:24:03] <BunnyEmperor> the hell LUL
[1:24:06] <%Sora20030c> hes trying to body block?
[1:24:06] <%Starotter70> WHAT A HERO
[1:24:06] <$thesickestzak> @tusk102 like maybe 45ish minutes ago gameplay started
[1:24:07] <XdaXcaptainX> that dude was greedy
[1:24:10] <SomeOtherNeb> ?????
[1:24:15] <SomeOtherNeb> what the frick
[1:24:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:24:19] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @OmegaWeltall you can see the ptb to play him or look for the experience videos
[1:24:20] <rissaleigh14> Bodyblocking
[1:24:21] <%tumzfestival> @PlagueOfGripes It does seem to rely on stuff like hooking too much
[1:24:22] <jase__x> Are they trying to get more points
[1:24:22] <%manwithboxonhead> WaowWaowWaow
[1:24:23] <%Dementedpenguin> This..... THIS HERO Kappa
[1:24:24] <%Lizard0TM> They're fucking with you
[1:24:25] <apolitenoob> Love the balls on that guy
[1:24:26] <+GenesisKnight> that was interesting
[1:24:26] <Wondabarrapa> protip, if you look down at the pallet sometimes you can trick them into thinking you're breaking it and get a head start into chasing them
[1:24:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Trap people
[1:24:31] <@SoFarFetched> !uptime
[1:24:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 24m.
[1:24:34] <ChoculaUltra> I love how two love taps of the foot completely destroys pallets
[1:24:35] <%Treuan> Was that Full House?
[1:24:35] <%PlagueOfGripes> the scoring doesn't, but that's backend, not really the objective
[1:24:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @doc_ock_rokc so like... kicking them helps degrade them more dude... like, bruh?
[1:24:36] <%tumzfestival> @PlagueOfGripes If it's one of the few ways to finish someone
[1:24:37] <FirearmsInstructor> @PlagueOfGripes What would you do, gameplay mechanics wise to fix it? (If anything)
[1:24:46] <Captain_Doomsday> Faking breaking is an Otz tech. 60% of the time, it works every time.
[1:24:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> That guy LUL
[1:24:53] <FirearmsInstructor> ROFL
[1:24:53] <%Aracon_> oh wow this game looks way different since I've last seen it
[1:24:54] <dinnydanny777> They should add the greatest serial killer of all, time.
[1:24:56] <BunnyEmperor> the struggle LUL
[1:24:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @Th3SmartAlec LUL
[1:25:00] <SomeOtherNeb> he's just workin out
[1:25:00] <ChoculaUltra> ain't no one going back for that guy LUL
[1:25:02] <%Sora20030c> I got so much better at killer by watching Otz
[1:25:02] <%Bailey__gaming> hgnnngnngggh
[1:25:08] <%spiritofmojave> omg that boi is screwed LUL
[1:25:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Bane_Kaikyo Did they change that? I remember it being a problem for a while
[1:25:11] <%Sora20030c> learning his mind games is so helpful
[1:25:13] <%Aracon_> doesn't look as crusty
[1:25:16] <%tumzfestival> @dinnydanny777 DEEP lul
[1:25:18] <%Valask> psaWhat woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:25:22] <Wondabarrapa> i have no idea how that spaniard is so good at spotting survivors
[1:25:23] <Mako_Kreutzev> i havent seen this game in years
[1:25:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Gottem
[1:25:26] <rissaleigh14> He warned them off
[1:25:29] <%Mendin> That far out of the way generator is gonna become one of the final three and make your patrol fuck
[1:25:29] <+WarbossMetal> traps stop people from escaping through exits anyway so its usually good to save one or two till the end
[1:25:31] <Mako_Kreutzev> what character is he playing as?
[1:25:35] <%tumzfestival> PIGGY
[1:25:36] <%manwithboxonhead> Players: welp you are on your own good luck chief.
[1:25:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @PatStaresAt Friendly trap reminder <3 (Just this once)
[1:25:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Mako_Kreutzev Ezio

[1:25:52] <%gluemanofficial> Pat dont be mean he just wants to show you some more pallets
[1:25:59] <underFreddy> Pat is playing as Killerman from Illbleed
[1:26:00] <jase__x> What the hell are these guys doin?
[1:26:01] <bluefooddye1> I liked it better when they had original killers instead of featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series
[1:26:01] <%BubbaRands> do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior?
[1:26:04] <Mako_Kreutzev> are there any ara ara monster girls you can play as?
[1:26:05] <%DappercatEsquire> take that, streamer
[1:26:11] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Josef_Stryker the pig, AKA amanda from saw
[1:26:14] <Josef_Stryker> Oh is it Amanda from Saw?
[1:26:14] <%kewlmyc> ATTACK AND DETHRONE GOD
[1:26:15] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @doc_ock_rokc I don't know? I mean I haven't played in ages, but a kick still does a flat amount of degradation
[1:26:18] <+captain_elsewhere> man i forgot how bad survivors were outside red ranks, a mean there are some boosted potatoes but this is crazy
[1:26:19] <Ujean917> Yes the Huntress @DappercatEsquire
[1:26:20] <%tumzfestival> Is it Amanda specifically? So stupid to have the series randomly switch up jigsaw when Amanda was always there.
[1:26:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched OH shit thanks bro I needed that! OW FUCK ! Y U STAB D: ;-;
[1:26:21] <Captain_Doomsday> Spirit and Huntress are basically monster girls.
[1:26:21] <%manwithboxonhead> What is this monster?
[1:26:24] <AmericanaRed> VALPhoenix
[1:26:28] <tusk102> what character is this?

[1:26:32] <AmericanaRed> VALJett
[1:26:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Grabby hands
[1:26:33] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Mako_Kreutzev hmm you can play as demigorgon from stranger things
[1:26:36] <%JaydenSai> @tumzfestival Yeah its supposed to be Amanda
[1:26:37] <venomfury86> is this the guy from Aeon of Ruin?
[1:26:40] <BunnyEmperor> what
[1:26:40] <HarraceHarrison> They are just not touching gens, wonder if they're struggling to find ruin
[1:26:41] <Mako_Kreutzev> that's pretty hot
[1:26:41] <Mr_Strut> Is Pat just camping?

[1:26:59] <%Mendin> He learned the Claudette cloaking field
[1:27:02] <SomeOtherNeb> tbh shouldn't Pig lose automatically as a symbolic gesture these days?
[1:27:02] <%miguelrod777> flash stepping in the killer
[1:27:05] <+Excelumin> he fraked your mind, he went criss angel on your ass
[1:27:09] <Razgrizenl> wow the new assasins creed gameplay D:
[1:27:10] <%ChaosAethr> I saw him he ran left
[1:27:10] <zeif00> He went to the school
[1:27:25] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Lol criss cross angel does it again
[1:27:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Is Pat's facecam location fixed? It'd be better in the top corner for this game.
[1:27:29] <%Jhylla81> You Fist of the North Star'd him into a red mist with that stab
[1:27:29] <dinnydanny777> Woops
[1:27:34] <%tumzfestival> MIND FREAK
[1:27:34] <DracaenaLeaf> is that guy laggy?
[1:27:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Bane_Kaikyo Yeah but new hex instantly regresses at the time when they stop working on it so I know there was a time when you couldn't kick a regressing gen.
[1:27:38] <+captain_elsewhere> you will hear them from a decent distance if they are on a jigsaw box, they consantly make pained noises
[1:27:41] <FirearmsInstructor> Is it faster to crouch jump / ambush pounce around? Or net-distance-time-netural?
[1:27:44] <%Lizard0TM> Having watched TrU3Ta1ent and Otzdarva play DBD for so long, can absoltutely say that Survivors love to fuck with you and be toxic af
[1:27:46] <AmericanaRed> bamboozled
[1:27:55] <%tumzfestival> run amok
[1:28:00] <Captain_Doomsday> OH, btw, crows are disturbed when a player comes by. Killer or Survivor.
[1:28:01] <SomeOtherNeb> run a muk
[1:28:03] <%PlagueOfGripes> good plan though
[1:28:03] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Lizard0TM agreed
[1:28:06] <+evbites> the funny part of the assassin creed joke is the fact the hidden blade is now on top in valhalla
[1:28:07] <Mako_Kreutzev> why he laughing
[1:28:08] <RemnanTaka> The guy screams when impaled sound kind of like the screaming sun in Rick and Morty.

[1:28:55] <%manwithboxonhead> I thought he might get away.
[1:28:56] <FirearmsInstructor> Which one of these guys is the streamer?
[1:28:57] <Captain_Doomsday> Trap instakills after enough time not being chased.
[1:29:10] <dinnydanny777> I actually don't watch many horror films I can't think of who would be good they could add
[1:29:12] <$Ziegsy> 'I kick arse for the lord!'
[1:29:13] <%Aracon_> aww look at amanda's nail polish :)
[1:29:14] <zeif00> Surprised they haven't found ruin by now
[1:29:14] <TopTierHarley> Has Pat been bullying survivors?
[1:29:14] <%Mendin> @dakotachipmath Built-in slowdown to prevent instant double-stabs
[1:29:24] <%miguelrod777> bamboozled
[1:29:24] <tusk102> @dakotachipmath all characters do so that the survivor gets a second to run away
[1:29:27] <AmericanaRed> REAL PAT
[1:29:39] <FirearmsInstructor> How many ambush pounces does Pat need? I think he has 3?
[1:29:40] <%TrafficCohen> It's a trash movie but I'd like to see the kid from Brightburn
[1:29:40] <%tumzfestival> Wait... Is Kevin McAllister NOT in this game?
[1:29:42] <dinnydanny777> What if they added the Tyrant from Resident Evil
[1:29:42] <+captain_elsewhere> he cant help it they are playing very badly TopTierHarley
[1:29:42] <%Aydarkzero> LUL
[1:29:46] <Wondabarrapa> the stab cooldown looks really silly with maxed STBFL
[1:29:47] <Captain_Doomsday> Did they nerf window swings or did Pat just not lunge?
[1:29:52] <TopTierHarley> lol @captain_elsewhere
[1:29:56] <%GrumblePlays> shit, this game's still going? thought pat would have pulverised them now
[1:29:57] <+evbites> @dakotachipmath also to prevent rust
[1:29:59] <%Ner234> I'm so used to seeing Dbd only streamers play this that it feels weird when Pat plays.
[1:30:00] <%tumzfestival> I want Kevin from Home Alone
[1:30:07] <dinnydanny777> Their antisocial
[1:30:09] <%gluemanofficial> Healing takes too long Kappa

[1:30:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> @tumzfestival As the killer
[1:30:17] <dinnydanny777> They're* antisocial
[1:30:17] <HarraceHarrison> This madman doing gens with a trap on
[1:30:20] <FirearmsInstructor> Need to social distance because of COVID
[1:30:20] <ChoculaUltra> oooo Kevin McAllister for DbD. Make it happen.

[1:30:33] <%tumzfestival> @Th3SmartAlec WHAT OTHER ROLE?!
[1:30:36] <%WhereIsWill> kinda ridic to think a 100 pound woman can pick a dude up with one hand LUL
[1:30:38] <$thesickestzak> Have they said when they are going to add the turkey from Thankskilling yet?
[1:30:38] <Captain_Doomsday> I was scared they made window cheese easier than ever. Kevin McAllister would be a Killer, not a Survivor.
[1:30:39] <%Bane_Kaikyo> K E E K the J E N
[1:30:41] <CarelessWhimper> Which killer is Pat playing as?
[1:30:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @tumzfestival LUL
[1:30:46] <%dekkitout> @ChoculaUltra As a killer, or-?
[1:30:47] <ChoculaUltra> and the 2 thief guys can be survivors LUL
[1:30:47] <Captain_Doomsday> Pig from Saw.
[1:30:49] <%Lizard0TM> Pig
[1:30:49] <AmericanaRed> yeyeye
[1:30:50] <CarelessWhimper> I haven't looked at this game for like a year

[1:30:58] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:30:58] <%thelonechris> Wet Bandit Survivors
[1:30:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WhereIsWill Ideology is one hell of a drug
[1:30:59] <+GenesisKnight> LUL
[1:31:00] <%Nickmobox> Maybe give the pig the ability to apply the Trap in different ways? like of generators or something
[1:31:00] <Nomad_Scholar> Amanda is surprisingly strong
[1:31:00] <underFreddy> Are the Saw movies worth watching? Pig seems cool
[1:31:02] <viewtifulr> one job
[1:31:05] <%ChaosAethr> Good hustle
[1:31:06] <%spiritofmojave> right back to it LUL
[1:31:06] <+Excelumin> FARMEED
[1:31:08] <%tumzfestival> Amanda was a QT

[1:31:09] <Mr_Strut> He is not having a good day
[1:31:09] <%weissguard> Big plays from the survivors here.
[1:31:09] <Captain_Doomsday> SAW 2 is good.
[1:31:10] <%PlagueOfGripes> fuck friends
[1:31:10] <%Ner234> FARMED
[1:31:11] <heart_ablaze> who's pat playing as?

[1:31:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Damn
[1:31:14] <rissaleigh14> Welp
[1:31:15] <%GrumblePlays> @underFreddy watch the first three
[1:31:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oof
[1:31:16] <%Aracon_> vineMortis
[1:31:17] <%JaydenSai> @underFreddy First two are good, the rest? Not so good
[1:31:17] <+zepelinnn1> wow nice tunnel Kappa
[1:31:17] <%BubbaRands> back on the hook he goes
[1:31:17] <AmericanaRed> FRIEND
[1:31:17] <%GrumblePlays> stop there
[1:31:17] <%miguelrod777> he gave up
[1:31:18] <tusk102> @underFreddy it's a mixed bag
[1:31:18] <%Dementedpenguin> These survivors are really bad at team work
[1:31:19] <jimmytwofeet> PAT YOU MONSTERRRR
[1:31:20] <Josef_Stryker> So is this game primarily a PC game or is there a community on console?
[1:31:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> ?????
[1:31:20] <BunnyEmperor> lmao that flip
[1:31:22] <Captain_Doomsday> InB4 camping accusations
[1:31:24] <%riantDeliration> @underFreddy the original movie was pretty good, dunno about 2 and 3, pretty sure the rest are trash
[1:31:25] <%dekkitout> That ragdoll was fierce
[1:31:26] <Mr_Strut> fucking shadow clones
[1:31:27] <%PlagueOfGripes> he vanished for a second. I saw
[1:31:27] <FirearmsInstructor> TURBO-CRAWL
[1:31:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @underFreddy EHHHhH its okay 1 and 2 but 3 onwards goes...nuts
[1:31:28] <%kewlmyc> Did he teleport?
[1:31:28] <+razielhex> craaaaaaawwwwwling in my skiiiiiiin
[1:31:29] <%Ner234> I love it when they flip LUL
[1:31:31] <rissaleigh14> Framed that poor bastard
[1:31:34] <T_Sasquatch> Fast crawl
[1:31:38] <rissaleigh14> Farmed*
[1:31:38] <%Treuan> Nice work
[1:31:42] <zeif00> Gonna give this guy hatch?
[1:31:42] <%Plus_On_Black> I want to see Jimmy Jones
[1:31:44] <%PlagueOfGripes> his animation freaked out like the game misplaced his coordinates
[1:31:45] <Wondabarrapa> instant transmission dwight
[1:31:46] <%PettyFunk> Which killer is Pat playing as?
[1:31:47] <%tumzfestival> Trapped n Hooked
[1:31:48] <Captain_Doomsday> Hatch open!
[1:31:48] <+captain_elsewhere> now for trap door roulette
[1:31:48] <seclusivechain1> damn jigsaw really rigged those head traps to last forever huh?
[1:31:51] <%Mendin> Pats refusal to kick that generatro for some points is hurting me
[1:31:52] <%Plus_On_Black> Jimmy Bones
[1:31:56] <%weissguard> Yeah, he glitched out. Then he was around that stuff.
[1:31:58] <ChoculaUltra> dat pallet tho
[1:31:58] <%GrumblePlays> Saw 3D is genuinely one of the worst films I've ever seen in my god damn life
[1:31:58] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Was that generator done? if not it was close, it needed kicking!!
[1:32:01] <underFreddy> Thanks for the answers! Sounds like I'll watch the first two alone and then the last one with friends and alcohol
[1:32:01] <Thewoodentree> ....
[1:32:03] <%gluemanofficial> Every time I think there couldnt be more pallets on this map
[1:32:03] <Captain_Doomsday> A true master can slug to greed against hatch
[1:32:04] <+captain_elsewhere> he has ruin Mendin he cant kick them
[1:32:09] <+NitronStreams> ping crimson
[1:32:14] <Ujean917> PAT
[1:32:18] <Captain_Doomsday> He's probablt getting it in the basement
[1:32:19] <+Excelumin> I've had infections that haven't lasted as long as this Ruin has
[1:32:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> I like the hatch can be closed now
[1:32:35] <%JaydenSai> @Bane_Kaikyo He's using Ruin, so I think he'll be okay
[1:32:40] <%GrumblePlays> yeah he's got this unl;unless he has no idea where it is
[1:32:40] <Wondabarrapa> sometimes its best to not kick gens as it wastes time as well
[1:32:43] <FirearmsInstructor> Is hatch a constant? Or does it appear after time? Is it there from the start?
[1:32:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Excelumin I think they are new
[1:32:50] <underFreddy> Why are they sprinting all the time
[1:32:56] <Captain_Doomsday> Hatch has been closable for a long time. It appears after two kills I think.
[1:32:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> noice
[1:32:58] <Thewoodentree> GER GOT
[1:32:59] <BunnyEmperor> gg
[1:33:00] <%JaydenSai> @FirearmsInstructor Its there on match start, you CAN find it before it opens
[1:33:00] <%ChaosAethr> I saw the hatch
[1:33:02] <boomstickery> bad luck buddy
[1:33:02] <%weissguard> For him. LUL
[1:33:03] <Ujean917> TRAP PAT TRAP
[1:33:03] <%Lizard0TM> I feel like they handed over the game on a sliver platter
[1:33:05] <@SoFarFetched> WHU HAPPEN?
[1:33:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> How unfortunate for you
[1:33:06] <Mr_Strut> He tried so hard and got so far
[1:33:08] <%Ner234> He dead harded into the wall?
[1:33:08] <+Taglog7> Assassin's Creed?!
[1:33:08] <%spiritofmojave> 4U
[1:33:09] <%TheActuallyGuy> trap him for more points
[1:33:09] <Captain_Doomsday> There's no stamina in DbD. Probably should be.
[1:33:09] <TopTierHarley> has anyone cursed you out yet @PatStaresAt
[1:33:09] <+demon1103> how UNfortunate......XD
[1:33:10] <SomeOtherNeb> OOPS
[1:33:11] <%Kaji04> You hate to see it
[1:33:13] <+evbites> could one of the killer clowns from outerspace work or is the one clown enough
[1:33:14] <BunnyEmperor> trap and hook LUL
[1:33:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @JaydenSai thanks. I heard there's a key or something to unlock it, too, at some point.
[1:33:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> passive-aggressive serial killer Pat
[1:33:19] <%tumzfestival> The first SAW is a genuinely good horror movie when you take into account they had a TINY budget, it was the first film for the writer and director plus they filmed in the same studio the original Leprechaun was shot.
[1:33:19] <%luketrapwalker> Oh, I hope they'll be okay
[1:33:20] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @JaydenSai Even if the degradation doesn't stack, a kick still does flat damage
[1:33:21] <AFlyingTaco1> So do pallets respawn after the killer breaks them?
[1:33:21] <%Lizard0TM> Or maybe I'm just used to seeing galaxy brain gameplay
[1:33:24] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe they put Ezio in this game
[1:33:24] <Captain_Doomsday> Watch him break out now
[1:33:27] <%Kataguro> You did it
[1:33:30] <%Dementedpenguin> @AFlyingTaco1 no
[1:33:30] <%dekkitout> Unfortunate
[1:33:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AFlyingTaco1 no
[1:33:32] <Captain_Doomsday> Dropping someone progresses their struggle.
[1:33:33] <Thewoodentree> DOUBLE WAMMP
[1:33:34] <%PlagueOfGripes> go kick a gen
[1:33:35] <%WhereIsWill> ggs

[1:33:45] <%dekker21> Wow pig super op, plz nerf
[1:33:46] <%GalacticLatte> @PatStaresAt How many hours do you have in this game?
[1:33:47] <%Starotter70> That'll do Pig
[1:33:47] <Captain_Doomsday> Nice work, bone daddy.
[1:33:48] <HarraceHarrison> See Pat, Pig is actually top tier better than nurse billy spirit combined
[1:33:48] <%BubbaRands> gg
[1:33:49] <%Treuan> Hooray
[1:33:49] <@SoFarFetched> kick all the generators
[1:33:50] <zeif00> Legion time?
[1:33:51] <+VoytekBus> evil rules
[1:33:51] <%tumzfestival> peepoClap
[1:33:53] <%Nickmobox> Pig seems real fun
[1:33:53] <%weissguard> Pretty sure you're good.
[1:33:54] <%GrumblePlays> @FirearmsInstructor two gens have to be done before the hatch spawns
[1:33:54] <underFreddy> @FirearmsInstructor Hatch becomes visible when number of repaired generators exceed number of survivors I think.
[1:33:55] <toyforus235> play the new killer yet?
[1:33:55] <Nomad_Scholar> Your least favourite, and you killed it
[1:33:56] <+BobBaudoin> DANG
[1:33:56] <%Aracon_> yay pig lady
[1:33:58] <SoySocks> gj
[1:33:58] <+Excelumin> Nice work Ham Mommy
[1:33:59] <Silly_Duckling> @AFlyingTaco1 finite resource, that's part of the meta game, reducing survivor resources and survivors conserving them
[1:34:00] <%weissguard> That's a lot of time.
[1:34:01] <+RowenCleric> hows our boy triangle man
[1:34:01] <Cymen90> Ah, so still beginner :)
[1:34:04] <Captain_Doomsday> Rookie numbers
[1:34:06] <+SlightlySychotic> Happy oink!
[1:34:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> How many were Paige?
[1:34:07] <%Nickmobox> They could have gone super crazy with the trap premise of the pig
[1:34:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Blind
[1:34:10] <%W1nterTitan> So early days
[1:34:10] <%PlagueOfGripes> can't blame him. kicking gens isn't terribly fun
[1:34:14] <%BubbaRands> Pat would make a great murderer 4Head
[1:34:15] <%Mendin> blind
[1:34:16] <Valor_13> Is pyramid head out yet?
[1:34:16] <zeif00> No Surge?
[1:34:16] <dinnydanny777> What is this guy from?
[1:34:20] <+TraitorousAlf> What movie is the legion from
[1:34:20] <ImmaCanuck> we r leejun
[1:34:20] <+evbites> og
[1:34:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Smiley?!
[1:34:23] <%Sora20030c> reminder that discordance is better at level 1 than level 3
[1:34:23] <Captain_Doomsday> Legion's an OC
[1:34:23] <ChoculaUltra> is the Legion supposed to be Purge guy?
[1:34:24] <@SoFarFetched> I would thinkin kicking gens would be satisfying
[1:34:25] <%GrumblePlays> he's original
[1:34:25] <%Plus_On_Black> Ham Mommy is too good.
[1:34:25] <%Kataguro> He's an original killer
[1:34:25] <FirearmsInstructor> @GrumblePlays @underFreddy ahhh ok thank you that makes sense. Never actually knew. Cheers.
[1:34:26] <%Nickmobox> Not the Purge Purge guy
[1:34:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> =)
[1:34:28] <Thewoodentree> WHATS THAT CREEPY PASTA SHIT?
[1:34:29] <SulfurousAcid> so what killers are your favorite
[1:34:29] <+Mintios> What's legion about @PatStaresAt
[1:34:29] <%tumzfestival> Who was next to Demogorgon?
[1:34:30] <Mako_Kreutzev> @BubbaRands just stand on a stool and he cant reach you
[1:34:30] <zeif00> He's not bad
[1:34:30] <%GrumblePlays> but inspired by The Purge
[1:34:32] <@SoFarFetched> and Pyramid Head will probably take a week or two.
[1:34:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ChoculaUltra yeah
[1:34:33] <+captain_elsewhere> take monitor off the fuck now
[1:34:33] <%dekker21> Whats Legions deal?
[1:34:35] <ChoculaUltra> ah I see
[1:34:36] <%Dementedpenguin> Original character. Not every Killer is from a movie
[1:34:38] <televisedrevolting> Is Pyramid a thing in game yet?
[1:34:39] <%PettyFunk> Oh yikes I have that
[1:34:43] <Wondabarrapa> legion isn't that bad
[1:34:45] <AFlyingTaco1> From Mas Effect, right?
[1:34:47] <dinnydanny777> He literally just has a knife
[1:34:47] <Captain_Doomsday> He runs and stabs people but gets tired a lot
[1:34:47] <tusk102> @dekker21 there's 4 of them
[1:34:49] <+GenesisKnight> Pat the liar
[1:34:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah Legion is king with Thanatophobia
[1:34:52] <+evbites> gunslinger s the best
[1:34:53] <%JaydenSai> @PatStaresAt DBD on PSN is 60% off, if you wanna call that out
[1:34:55] <zeif00> Surge, Pop, Thrilling, Nurses
[1:34:55] <%GalacticLatte> Nooo keep discord
[1:34:57] <%PettyFunk> Wait Pat definitely has thanatophobia, he'd literally become a toilet to not die
[1:34:58] <%thelonechris> I like how this guy is just a dude with a knife
[1:35:00] <Captain_Doomsday> Missing makes him tired, pallets make him tired.
[1:35:01] <%tumzfestival> @televisedrevolting The testing event is over I believe
[1:35:05] <+Excelumin> Legions power is "I am speed"
[1:35:05] <%Nickmobox> Psn is dead for DBD
[1:35:06] <%Piemen99> Piemen99 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! beep beep you're a pat beep-beep You're a pat. Pet the baby for me
[1:35:07] <venomfury86> original killer, it's actually multiple people
[1:35:08] <%kewlmyc> Pat, you said you had BBQ and Chili on the podcast....
[1:35:08] <%dekker21> @tusk102 ah, neat thanks!
[1:35:08] <%GrumblePlays> Legion is four original characters, who you play as depends on which skin you pick
[1:35:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> But what does Legion do in gunslinger?
[1:35:11] <%PirateMike_> This guy looks like a creepy pasta a 12 year old would think is really spooky
[1:35:12] <%Plus_On_Black> Who's that guy?
[1:35:14] <%GalacticLatte> Surge is Demogorgon
[1:35:16] <%tumzfestival> STAB MAN aka KNIFEY BOY
[1:35:22] <zeif00> Surge is good on Legion
[1:35:26] <Thewoodentree> DISCOUNT JEFF THE KILLER
[1:35:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> He isn't really
[1:35:30] <+GenesisKnight> What does he do
[1:35:33] <%Aracon_> oh the purge movies
[1:35:35] <Captain_Doomsday> I love how this is Pat's Scrub Killer Corner
[1:35:36] <+Excelumin> he runs fast
[1:35:37] <%Kataguro> He sprints and stabs
[1:35:38] <+Excelumin> stabs fast
[1:35:38] <%GrumblePlays> he's the not-Purge Purge guy
[1:35:38] <tusk102> he literally has nothing to do with the purge
[1:35:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GenesisKnight Stabby then goes crazy fast
[1:35:40] <FirearmsInstructor> Was the purge any good? Or any similar type movies?
[1:35:40] <televisedrevolting> @tumzfestival Is Pat checking him out today or has he already done so.
[1:35:40] <Wondabarrapa> Original character
[1:35:41] <tonfirean> Purgemn
[1:35:44] <televisedrevolting> *?
[1:35:46] <rissaleigh14> He run and stab
[1:35:47] <+evbites> i thought he was discount ghost face
[1:35:47] <ChoculaUltra> I'd pay for a level themed around The Cube
[1:35:48] <Captain_Doomsday> Leave Discordance at level 1!
[1:35:48] <+captain_elsewhere> yeah like spirit isnt from ring/grudge just based around that theme
[1:35:49] <BunnyEmperor> dem riffs
[1:35:50] <Sotetsu> Yay, Legion is the best! raging132Smile raging132Hi raging132Smile
[1:35:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GenesisKnight also can jump over pallets
[1:35:51] <%ChaosAethr> OC

[1:35:54] <%Shady_Squid> Legally distinct from The Purge man.
[1:35:55] <%Tearonex> OC do not steal
[1:35:56] <SulfurousAcid> I play dbd on ps4, matchmaking is a bit wonky but the playerbase is fine
[1:35:58] <+Excelumin> he can do parkour
[1:35:58] <dinnydanny777> They should add Wesker
[1:36:00] <HarraceHarrison> Become woman, pick Julie instead of smelly Frank
[1:36:00] <marsghoul> gang killers? its weird
[1:36:01] <%Ner234> CAT
[1:36:03] <zeif00> Yeah discordance tier 1 is better than tier 3
[1:36:03] <%tumzfestival> @televisedrevolting I think he was late to stream it yeah but he will when he can
[1:36:04] <+GenesisKnight> Not bad for a killer moveset
[1:36:04] <weirdducks> nope
[1:36:05] <Thewoodentree> The Strangers is dog shit
[1:36:06] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt they're four people. they killed a person and hid it

[1:36:10] <toyforus235> edgdy teen who kills
[1:36:10] <%GrumblePlays> pretty sure the look is inspired by the Purge but the backstory is original
[1:36:11] <underFreddy> Legion is the bored small-town teenagers wanting to have fun
[1:36:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @dinnydanny777 Does he teleport or run real fast?
[1:36:15] <BackwardCap> He's an Anon

[1:36:31] <%GalacticLatte> Remember @PatStaresAt Discordance level 1 is better than level 2 and 3
[1:36:37] <%Bailey__gaming> Boop goes the snoot
[1:36:41] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt there's 4 people, not just 1. Kind of a psycho with 3 friends who are stuck with him since they're part of the murder
[1:36:42] <%GrumblePlays> Susie best girl
[1:36:42] <%xxshadowxx416> elmo good content
[1:36:42] <Wondabarrapa> literally the only thing similar to the purge is they wear a mask
[1:36:43] <CatmanIX> legally distinct purgeman
[1:36:43] <venomfury86> that's why he's called legion, there is more than one

[1:36:56] <HarraceHarrison> It gives more frequent updates, its minor but true
[1:36:57] <DrRyder> Discordance 1 gives you a notification more often
[1:36:57] <Captain_Doomsday> Discordance 1 notifies you more often.
[1:36:58] <zeif00> Discordance pops less often at higher tiers
[1:36:58] <rissaleigh14> Consume his powers
[1:37:00] <Silly_Duckling> The game's not exactly what you'd call "balanced"
[1:37:02] <%Lizard0TM> there's already a clown
[1:37:04] <+DrPoxx> never upgrade it
[1:37:04] <+captain_elsewhere> because the cooldown is longer on higher tier
[1:37:06] <%GalacticLatte> @PatStaresAt Because it procs every 8 seconds at level 1 and 12 seconds at level 3 it goes off more often
[1:37:08] <%Aracon_> that's goofy
[1:37:09] <%BubbaRands> boop boop psaProgmo snoot snoot
[1:37:09] <%Dementedpenguin> Cooldown is quicker
[1:37:12] <Captain_Doomsday> It's more specific info
[1:37:12] <Sotetsu> @grumbleplays She suuuure is.
[1:37:13] <SulfurousAcid> discordance 1 gives you notifications more often
[1:37:15] <zeif00> It's stupid
[1:37:15] <%BubbaRands> psaPorgmo
[1:37:16] <+evbites> when cujo
[1:37:18] <televisedrevolting> Ah fuck when's Hellevator in Dead by Daylight?
[1:37:21] <%PirateMike_> Whens man bear pig
[1:37:23] <+captain_elsewhere> they will be changing that
[1:37:25] <%Ner234> Why is it like that?
[1:37:27] <Thewoodentree> @Lizard0TM But are they aliens?
[1:37:27] <%tumzfestival> WHENS DEATHBED?
[1:37:29] <ChoculaUltra> can they add the robo waifu from Deus Ex Machina? asking for a friend
[1:37:33] <%ChaosAethr> Well
[1:37:33] <Sotetsu> It is very stupid
[1:37:33] <%Piemen99> Damn
[1:37:34] <zeif00> Could always prestige LUL
[1:37:34] <%Aydarkzero> whoops
[1:37:35] <HarraceHarrison> Its not a huge deal, but yeah its dumb
[1:37:37] <%GalacticLatte> You can if you prestige the character
[1:37:37] <%TheActuallyGuy> gotta prestige them
[1:37:38] <rissaleigh14> Ah video games
[1:37:44] <legacy0117> Oh snap.
[1:37:46] <Captain_Doomsday> I WISH you could use lower levels of perks you have improved
[1:37:48] <%GalacticLatte> But yeah I figured they'd change it
[1:37:50] <%GrumblePlays> ah yes, horror classic Death Bed: The Bed That Eats
[1:37:53] <BackwardCap> Pres5i
[1:37:57] <%Starotter70> When's Bunnicula?
[1:37:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> isn't Frank Morrison a comic book writer?
[1:37:59] <%tumzfestival> Prestige? YOU CAN PLAY AS HUGH JACKMAN?
[1:37:59] <+CayreI> He's a fast stabby boi
[1:38:00] <zeif00> You just cant down people, you can injure them tho
[1:38:00] <Mr_Strut> What does that mean?
[1:38:07] <Captain_Doomsday> Legion's run-stabs ALSO don't apply on-hits, btw.
[1:38:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Mr_Strut you bleed out
[1:38:12] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> if they dont heal they go down
[1:38:12] <dinnydanny777> If they have to put the enemies on hooks aren't they forced to only add characters who are humanoids
[1:38:13] <%patriotrenegade> cuz hes a weak bitch
[1:38:20] <%GalacticLatte> @Captain_Doomsday It's very situational that level 1 is better than level 2 and 3
[1:38:20] <EmpyreanMAULER> how did the match with piggy go?
[1:38:24] <%GrumblePlays> Legion is stabby gang
[1:38:32] <legacy0117> Wesker just Weskers, the game never explains how he dodges bullets or his speed.
[1:38:32] <zeif00> Feral Frenzy stabs aren't basic attacks so they don't work with STBFL ect.
[1:38:33] <rissaleigh14> If you don’t mend they go down, it’s different from healing
[1:38:34] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt which member of the legion do you like best?
[1:38:36] <dinnydanny777> Like no Xenomorphs or monsters because they can't put people on hooks
[1:38:38] <SulfurousAcid> however, any frenzy hit counts as a won chase so points
[1:38:40] <Captain_Doomsday> @GalacticLatte True, but there are situations, as we've just seen.
[1:38:41] <Silly_Duckling> Basically, Tunnel the survivor: the movie, the game
[1:38:53] <%GalacticLatte> @PatStaresAt Yeah I messed up and wasn't paying attention and got it to level 3 on Legion who I main LOL but I hate the idea of prestiging in this game
[1:38:54] <%GrumblePlays> Xenomorph can work in DBD if Demogorgon is in
[1:38:55] <%tumzfestival> My favorite identity of Legion is Susan and Sunshine...........
[1:38:57] <EmpyreanMAULER> hell yeah, the ruin and surveillance hehe
[1:38:58] <SulfurousAcid> Susie best legion
[1:38:58] <+evbites> WHEN KID TV SHOW ABOUT TEEN INVESTIGATORS AND AN ANIMAL MASCOT
[1:39:02] <ChoculaUltra> have they thought of an insane killer vs killer vs survivor mode yet? Kinda like a Freddy vs Jason thing
[1:39:03] <%manwithboxonhead> I have known dead by daylight for a while. Would you say it’s worth buying?
[1:39:04] <Captain_Doomsday> Legion's power is supposed to be anti-tunnel, but makes him best at tunnelling.
[1:39:05] <HarraceHarrison> You should have Julie unlocked by default
[1:39:12] <%Eaglestrike117> Eaglestrike117 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:39:12] <+MessyBristles> @dinnydanny777 then whats the demogorgon lol
[1:39:13] <zeif00> The Legion outfit in the Rift is pretty top tier tho
[1:39:13] <%GalacticLatte> @Captain_Doomsday For sure, but if they're changing it, makes it less so
[1:39:14] <+captain_elsewhere> deep wound is an effect where a bar appears under the survivors icon the bar slowly drains if they are not running and outside the killers terror radius, if it hits 0 they go down, you can get rid of this status effect by mending
[1:39:14] <Captain_Doomsday> It's not! Don't buy Dead by Daylight!
[1:39:14] <RevolverBobkat> Some lovely campers. Time to shower them in love and affection
[1:39:17] <jnapier42> would Tums defeat a xenomorph?
[1:39:20] <televisedrevolting> When's Bray Wyatt in DBD
[1:39:20] <Thewoodentree> WHEN SKELETON
[1:39:21] <+razielhex> Ayyyyyyy Paisaiiiinos
[1:39:26] <%GrumblePlays> Frank and Julie are default Legion, Joet and Susie are DLC
[1:39:27] <dinnydanny777> Oh I guess I'm just wrong then
[1:39:31] <+evbites> the ones with shark and a werewolf for some reason
[1:39:33] <$Mekhet09> Is there any survivor you hate fighting against?
[1:39:38] <%tumzfestival> Rich Evans clones is what you want
[1:39:43] <%patriotrenegade> You're a cold-blooded killer, you must be insaaaaaaane, stupid man of hate!
[1:39:43] <televisedrevolting> I'm still thinking about Hellevator in DBD.
[1:39:49] <%tumzfestival> what everyone needs
[1:39:50] <%GrumblePlays> ah yes, Blendette
[1:39:53] <+zepelinnn1> Doing gens, you?
[1:39:55] <%GalacticLatte> Just get Nurses for Claudette ezpz
[1:39:56] <Wondabarrapa> claudette players are despicable
[1:39:58] <dinnydanny777> How about if they add those horrible dogs from every single game ever made
[1:39:59] <%Starotter70> @televisedrevolting Oh, that's a strong one
[1:39:59] <Captain_Doomsday> Blendettes are notoriously awful, even for other Survivors.
[1:40:04] <ChoculaUltra> is Claudette the one with the camo? Cuz she can eat a bag of dicks.
[1:40:05] <EmpyreanMAULER> I rather enjoy thanataphobia, dying light, sloppy, and pop. use the green pin for his frenzy
[1:40:06] <+Excelumin> Claudette: Will it blend?
[1:40:11] <primaryfire> is this the most succesful asymmetric multiplayer game of all time
[1:40:11] <jase__x> why are they the worst?
[1:40:12] <+captain_elsewhere> what i hate most in dbd are smurfs/derankers
[1:40:16] <rissaleigh14> Even survivors hate Claudette
[1:40:23] <%PlagueOfGripes> being very helpful to other survivors
[1:40:25] <EmpyreanMAULER> the survivors will never heal and barely get any gen progression
[1:40:27] <+BobBaudoin> Nah it is
[1:40:27] <+MessyBristles> I actually really like legion
[1:40:27] <%patriotrenegade> Revolting against the human race, Don't give a damn about anyone, What gives you the right, To put man's life in your hands? You're a cold-blooded killer, You must be insaaaaaane
[1:40:30] <Captain_Doomsday> There's no competition!
[1:40:30] <+BobBaudoin> it definitely is
[1:40:31] <%Ner234> It might be
[1:40:32] <%GrumblePlays> any Nea with a bright outfit you just know is gonna be toxic
[1:40:33] <+razielhex> Does L4D Multiplayer count?
[1:40:34] <%GrumblePlays> yeah it is
[1:40:34] <jnapier42> we would need enough folding chables for all the rich evans clones to lay on
[1:40:36] <%TrafficCohen> More successful than EVOLVE
[1:40:36] <garbageheaphound> it might be
[1:40:37] <%Jekado> what about EVOLVE!
[1:40:37] <+abrupt_abe> L4D was assymetric
[1:40:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> AH!
[1:40:37] <%Aracon_> seems like it
[1:40:38] <+mikesapartment> l4d totally counts
[1:40:39] <jase__x> Yeah
[1:40:40] <%Dementedpenguin> There's literally no competition
[1:40:40] <%Starotter70> AH
[1:40:41] <+evbites> whens eric andre and hannibal lecture
[1:40:41] <dinnydanny777> brzztt
[1:40:44] <Dreigun> I was kinda thinking of getting into this, but I'm worried about not knowing the community etiquette since it's been going for a while
[1:40:44] <BunnyEmperor> insight gained
[1:40:45] <Captain_Doomsday> People just really love horror icons and no other game can get off the ground.
[1:40:46] <+captain_elsewhere> woah dont frenzy untill you see survivors
[1:40:47] <+heretostream> I love DBD
[1:40:49] <+razielhex> L4D1 was pretty successful.
[1:40:53] <+WarbossMetal> Successful? Yeah, the best? idk
[1:40:56] <%Dementedpenguin> Every game that tries to mimic it doesn't commit to new content
[1:40:57] <%PlagueOfGripes> none of them are terribly amazing, but
[1:41:03] <%GrumblePlays> @Dreigun don't worry about it, you'll pick it up pretty quickly
[1:41:07] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt l4d might beat it
[1:41:08] <ChoculaUltra> I love how Amanda and Purge guy are literally just "we have knives and shit"
[1:41:10] <homosexualavian> hey pat how much longer you playin ?
[1:41:11] <+razielhex> TECHNOTHYME
[1:41:14] <%Kataguro> That Dead Hard
[1:41:16] <+egalitarian696969> thaty was quick
[1:41:20] <Captain_Doomsday> Friday the 13th ate copyright problems, White Noise 2 was never marketed, Last Year had a PR disaster on Discord...
[1:41:21] <%Kataguro> What is this man doing?
[1:41:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> L4D is amazing!
[1:41:23] <tusk102> wowie
[1:41:25] <BunnyEmperor> yeeeehnnnggh
[1:41:25] <%tumzfestival> Stabbo Gang
[1:41:26] <FirearmsInstructor> YNGGGGGGGGGGHHH YOUGHHHHHHHH YNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGNHNN
[1:41:27] <+MessyBristles> pat don't stab injured surviors while in frenzy or it ends it
[1:41:28] <+razielhex> yeeeummm
[1:41:29] <Captain_Doomsday> REsistance is packed in with 3 Remake.
[1:41:29] <sharpington_> !uptime
[1:41:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 41m.
[1:41:32] <%Starotter70> Yegheghgeghennnnnnnnn
[1:41:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> YEAHHHH
[1:41:32] <HarraceHarrison> A lot of people expect you to leave and go for other guys so they just mend in your face
[1:41:33] <%Kaji04> wow, that looked whay easier than what Pig's toolkit had
[1:41:33] <jase__x> More stabbies
[1:41:34] <@SoFarFetched> this guy is MASSIVELY constipated.
[1:41:34] <%GrumblePlays> assymetrical games are pretty tough to get right
[1:41:37] <%GalacticLatte> People who mend in front of Legion literally just asked to be downed with no stress
[1:41:39] <legacy0117> Isometric/Asometric? This isn't Final Fantasy tactics.
[1:41:40] <Dragon_Batman> Heya, been a while. how's everyone doing
[1:41:44] <Silly_Duckling> The problem with l4d is that when a person wants to play the zombies, they queue up for the versus mode..., but not when they want to play survivors.
[1:41:44] <Wondabarrapa> because they were an idiot and didn't run
[1:41:44] <+captain_elsewhere> yeah dont stab people in deep wound just cancel frenzy
[1:41:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched lol yeah that's what I was getting at LUL
[1:41:45] <@SoFarFetched> and sounded like he let a painful poo out LUL
[1:41:47] <Wondabarrapa> also wasted deadhard
[1:41:49] <neVan0> these noises LUL
[1:41:50] <Captain_Doomsday> Go to the farthest hook so escaping is harder for them when you basement. If you have time.
[1:41:50] <ChoculaUltra> nice!
[1:41:50] <AFlyingTaco1> That Predator game seems to be doing fine though
[1:41:52] <+BobBaudoin> Idk is Resistance alive on pc? I thougth steamchart gave it really low playercount
[1:41:55] <BunnyEmperor> damn legion fast
[1:41:58] <%Kataguro> It never did
[1:42:00] <FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched like.... breaking a major sweat LUL
[1:42:00] <%manwithboxonhead> I spent a lot of time playing Nosgoth and got great at it, until it was shutdown because it wasn’t profitable to run it. Still bitter about that.
[1:42:01] <zeif00> It never did
[1:42:01] <+CayreI> Don't forget about Evolve, that was an assymetrical game
[1:42:02] <%Ner234> I never did
[1:42:02] <+captain_elsewhere> it never did
[1:42:02] <%PlagueOfGripes> maybe it'll do more fine when it's allowed to be on Steam
[1:42:04] <dinnydanny777> Oh Predator would be a character to add
[1:42:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> L4D normally isn't assymetric, but every mission can be played assymetrically
[1:42:07] <rissaleigh14> Legion encourages leaving survivors so the deep wound can take effect
[1:42:08] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> no
[1:42:12] <jase__x> no
[1:42:12] <%Kataguro> That would be OP as shit
[1:42:15] <Cymen90> @SoFarFetched Don't talk about Pat like that. You know he had surgery because of that :(
[1:42:18] <%GalacticLatte> @PatStaresAt Nope they changed it, it's better to drop your power, it doesn't reduce deep wound anymore
[1:42:18] <+SlightlySychotic> Legion isn’t too bad. His power isn’t great but he’s small so he’s hard to see.
[1:42:20] <rissaleigh14> And the frenzy can keep going
[1:42:23] <+heretostream> LUL
[1:42:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @rissaleigh14 deep wound = ??
[1:42:25] <ChoculaUltra> lmao, Predator just uses the shoulder mounted cannon - insta gibs but on a cooldown LUL
[1:42:27] <+BobBaudoin> Aw man I miss nosgoth, I loved playing the sentinel vampire
[1:42:27] <EmpyreanMAULER> no, use the killer frenzy to deep wound other survivors
[1:42:28] <HarraceHarrison> It used to deplete their deep wound timer, but now it doesn't
[1:42:28] <+Ceromidas> @PatStaresAt they nerfed legion into the dirt a while back
[1:42:31] <+WarbossMetal> That would be huntress levels of bs
[1:42:33] <Captain_Doomsday> Resistance is alive. I think it's relatively strong, but being gimped by not having standalone sale.
[1:42:36] <+egalitarian696969> against good players he's the worst
[1:42:36] <Dragon_Batman> Predator has his own game with this style, so I doubt it
[1:42:40] <tusk102> i kinda wish legions "theres four of them" thing was used more
[1:42:43] <%Piemen99> This character seems hella broken since he can so fast
[1:42:46] <+Ceromidas> unless you run franks mixtape i think you cant accelerate the bleedout at all
[1:42:48] <rissaleigh14> Deep wound means that if they don’t mend themselves, they will get downed
[1:42:49] <@SoFarFetched> @Cymen90 and Pat's poops were never the same since sipsipHellmo
[1:42:49] <Captain_Doomsday> Legion is still good with Nemesis, right?
[1:42:52] <%GrumblePlays> Yeah, Predator and Jason are NEVER getting in
[1:42:55] <legacy0117> This character has to be fast if the knife doesn't down in two stabs
[1:42:56] <HarraceHarrison> The second hit NEEDS to be a regular down
[1:43:05] <dinnydanny777> When people talk about Resistance do they mean the old PS3 game or something else
[1:43:09] <%Starotter70> Yeeeeeghhnnnnn
[1:43:09] <%tumzfestival> Jason already had his own game
[1:43:12] <ImmaCanuck> EUUYYYYYY
[1:43:14] <FirearmsInstructor> HNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
[1:43:14] <+evbites> i will never understand why single player games always push bad online modes
[1:43:15] <%PirateMike_> Yuuuuuup
[1:43:15] <Mr_Strut> Is he taking a shit?
[1:43:16] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Piemen99 he gests owned by teamwork and gen rush has no presure in map and has to eat all the loops annyway
[1:43:17] <%Aracon_> eeeeuuuuunnnnnnn
[1:43:19] <AFlyingTaco1> Hey, do any of you guys know if Planetside 2 is still alive on PS4?
[1:43:19] <Dragon_Batman> Also I find it funny that the Predator game got Arnie but not MK
[1:43:20] <%Dementedpenguin> @dinnydanny777 the REmake 3 multiplayer
[1:43:21] <%Kaji04> AEIOU
[1:43:21] <@SoFarFetched> just let the poop come out naturally
[1:43:22] <%Aydarkzero> @dinnydanny777 Resident Evil multiplayer that came w/ re3r
[1:43:25] <%spiritofmojave> BRAAAP
[1:43:26] <neVan0> YEEEEEuh
[1:43:26] <@SoFarFetched> never force it
[1:43:30] <%Piemen99> Ah
[1:43:30] <+EySoyCoco> No cube?
[1:43:31] <%GalacticLatte> I really don't like Lery's as legion
[1:43:32] <dinnydanny777> Ah ok
[1:43:32] <%GrumblePlays> @dinnydanny777 probably the Resident Evil game that came with RE3
[1:43:33] <%Shady_Squid> AEIOU
[1:43:33] <+MessyBristles> your supposed to stab one person then move on to the next
[1:43:33] <Captain_Doomsday> You have just a little more than you think, Pat. But Break Out can change that.
[1:43:37] <%xxshadowxx416> re resistance is a good game
[1:43:43] <Wondabarrapa> I love running iron grasp and agitation and always dragging people to the basement from across the map
[1:43:45] <+zepelinnn1> nice pallet man
[1:43:47] <%GalacticLatte> The map is awkward for their power
[1:43:51] <Captain_Doomsday> WHAT WAS HIS PLAN!?
[1:44:02] <johnbonne97> i reallly wish this game had crossplayh
[1:44:02] <%Starotter70> Remember kids chug as much Fiber as possible
[1:44:05] <johnbonne97> so much fun
[1:44:06] <%PirateMike_> @SoFarFetched I hear forcing it can make your ass bleed
[1:44:08] <%xxshadowxx416> re resistant feel better as a survive
[1:44:09] <ChoculaUltra> I'd give RE Resistance a shot it it was sold standalone :/
[1:44:17] <$personmanthingg> the power of the slav squat sprint
[1:44:18] <+BloodyBurney> really digging the normal-type vibe of this killer, just a guy that stabs
[1:44:20] <+NotSoSmokey> what guy is he playing
[1:44:21] <%Kataguro> That's more like it
[1:44:24] <Reanimator83> Why does it take forever to connect to a match of DBD on console now? Feels like they fucked something up with an update
[1:44:25] <+Excelumin> Legion
[1:44:26] <%Kataguro> @NotSoSmokey Legion
[1:44:26] <+captain_elsewhere> legion NotSoSmokey
[1:44:29] <dinnydanny777> So this guy's power is the power of running I guess
[1:44:31] <+evbites> whens raptor from Jurassic park
[1:44:31] <legacy0117> Oh yeah he can sprint, way faster.
[1:44:33] <HomebaseRED> what killer is this?
[1:44:35] <%Kataguro> Good DH
[1:44:39] <%GrumblePlays> i get the feeling Resistance will be standalone sooner rather than later
[1:44:40] <+NotSoSmokey> that from a film or something
[1:44:41] <Captain_Doomsday> I'm buying REsistance if it ever comes out standalone, but I'm not dropping $70 on RE3r
[1:44:42] <%GalacticLatte> @HomebaseRED The Legion
[1:44:42] <EmpyreanMAULER> they got your ruin
[1:44:42] <rissaleigh14> Legion
[1:44:43] <+Excelumin> he can also vault pallets like a survivor
[1:44:44] <+captain_elsewhere> legion
[1:44:44] <dinnydanny777> "My power is, I can sprint"
[1:44:46] <underFreddy> @BloodyBurney You can also be a girl who just stabs. Good character
[1:44:52] <+NotSoSmokey> dont really know that killer
[1:44:55] <%Scooterbug9000> you winning? @PatStaresAt
[1:44:58] <%Aydarkzero> @Captain_Doomsday that's exactly my issue w/ re3r
[1:44:59] <XelGel> he can sprint and jump over downed pallets
[1:44:59] <zeif00> Wait you're running M&A, wouldn't that conflict with his power?
[1:44:59] <FirearmsInstructor> deadhard?
[1:45:01] <rissaleigh14> I can sprint but only for a little bit
[1:45:03] <%tumzfestival> THEY NEED TO REMAKE THIS GAME WITH STANDS
[1:45:05] <tusk102> are ya winnin son?
[1:45:07] <+captain_elsewhere> are ya winnin son KKona
[1:45:09] <%Kaji04> "Good job, you get HOOK as reward"
[1:45:12] <HomebaseRED> @GalacticLatte thx
[1:45:19] <%PirateMike_> I want the ring girl as a monster
[1:45:19] <%Ner234> LUL
[1:45:20] <Wondabarrapa> trappers power is that he can just use bear traps so it's not that ridiculous
[1:45:23] <ChoculaUltra> Legion seems to be themed around The Strangers/The Purge type of "everyday joe but off the fucking shits with a knife" type of archetype
[1:45:24] <%Aydarkzero> wow sick juke Kappa
[1:45:24] <apolitenoob> That was just depressing
[1:45:24] <%kewlmyc> Why would they do that?
[1:45:25] <%Piemen99> damn
[1:45:28] <KingKZ> This has a shockingly good mobile port that people should check out if the console/PC version is unavailable to you.

[1:45:41] <Captain_Doomsday> @Aydarkzero Right? Capcom is really overselling 3r and running a good game into the ground to do it.

[1:46:13] <%PirateMike_> @lwpabloelenano2hc cool
[1:46:17] <Captain_Doomsday> Scissor man is possible now! They added Pyramid Head, the first good Killer since...Spirit?
[1:46:21] <%GohanHitsugaya> Make em scream Pat.
[1:46:22] <+ItsAGundamu> Which monster is Pat playing as?
[1:46:27] <KingKZ> I demand Pumpkinhead get added!
[1:46:28] <$personmanthingg> he was thinkin the double duke
[1:46:28] <%Kataguro> Legion
[1:46:29] <FirearmsInstructor> LOL WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:46:29] <%Ner234> I'm so used to rank 1 killer streamers going up against godlike survivros that watching this potato team feels ... weirdd LUL
[1:46:30] <%xxshadowxx416> it to bad pat never did a stream of re resistant pat should do a stream of re resistant
[1:46:30] <%GalacticLatte> @ItsAGundamu The Legion
[1:46:30] <Captain_Doomsday> The greatest monster of all: MAN
[1:46:32] <+GenesisKnight> Well that was unfortunate for him
[1:46:33] <CrazyMedicine> LUL
[1:46:35] <+mikesapartment> why do people keep trying to juke
[1:46:36] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:46:39] <legacy0117> Also does this guy emit a red light? He might just be way fast and stealthy.
[1:46:40] <+captain_elsewhere> oni is latest is good
[1:46:41] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Captain_Doomsday ph is not that good. he strong but not that good
[1:46:43] <%Shadicara> On the hook ye go
[1:46:47] <%Kaji04> Man, Pat just likes hunting people down
[1:46:48] <%Scooterbug9000> anyone else notice how cute pat looks?
[1:46:52] <+captain_elsewhere> oni is latest good killer Captain_Doomsday
[1:46:53] <Wondabarrapa> all killers have the redstain
[1:46:54] <Cactuskris> I don´t why anyone would ever want to play survivor in this
[1:46:54] <%GalacticLatte> @legacy0117 Yes every killer has as red stain
[1:46:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @KingKZ If they dont have a decent pc, ((% they wont have a phone to run the mobile version even close to decent
[1:46:57] <%tumzfestival> Tryna be click
[1:47:01] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> and again freddy is already in the game he is the nightmare
[1:47:04] <j0ustar> fuck fancy fancy kills
[1:47:06] <%GrumblePlays> @legacy0117 all killers have that
[1:47:06] <SomeOtherNeb> Pat plays like Jack in RE7 acts
[1:47:06] <Silly_Duckling> There's literally nothing else they can do if there isn't a palette nearby.
[1:47:08] <Captain_Doomsday> Oni seems like just Hillbilly but better.
[1:47:15] <%Dementedpenguin> @Cactuskris it's less stressful than playing killer for most
[1:47:17] <%GalacticLatte> @legacy0117 Except for stealth killers
[1:47:17] <underFreddy> Survivor is pretty fun in this.
[1:47:21] <%tumzfestival> Why juke? Some mofos always trying to iceskate uphill.
[1:47:23] <+evbites> whens old timey ghost in a sheet with eye holes
[1:47:24] <legacy0117> Okay, just asking.
[1:47:40] <Captain_Doomsday> I'm sad PH isn't good though. I quit DbD long ago but he looked actually fun.
[1:47:42] <+captain_elsewhere> inconsistant but stronger imo Captain_Doomsday
[1:47:43] <%tumzfestival> @evbites Right?
[1:47:46] <Silly_Duckling> @Captain_Doomsday Oni has the slow wind-up, he doesn't start with his power. Billy gets his mapcontrol immediately
[1:47:46] <zeif00> Remember Killer Instinct is dependent on your Terror Radius which you reduced with M&A
[1:47:48] <+CayreI> Hatch time
[1:47:49] <venomfury86> WHERE'D SHE GO
[1:47:50] <rissaleigh14> Oof
[1:47:52] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I wonder if Nemesis has potential in this game
[1:48:11] <dinnydanny777> Mr X would be perfect
[1:48:11] <rissaleigh14> Can you find the hatch before them though?
[1:48:13] <ChoculaUltra> someone mentioned Jack from RE7 and now I want him in the game
[1:48:14] <legacy0117> Then find th he hatch.
[1:48:15] <%GalacticLatte> Wait it was bugged LOL
[1:48:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> @venomfury86 GET BACK HE- WHERE'D SHE GO?
[1:48:18] <%Scooterbug9000> can those exits be even closer? lol
[1:48:19] <%Dementedpenguin> WTF, those doors LUL
[1:48:20] <Captain_Doomsday> @Silly_Duckling But Oni has blood orb tracking and can instadown from standing once his power's up. He also has no wall collision, right?
[1:48:21] <+GenesisKnight> that's unlucky
[1:48:21] <+pectusumbra> would you want nemesis or Burkin though?
[1:48:22] <%GalacticLatte> The hatch had no hole LOL
[1:48:24] <Dragon_Batman> Didn't realize you can close the hatch
[1:48:27] <dinnydanny777> Mr X would probably actually be really good
[1:48:33] <Captain_Doomsday> You can't close the hatch in Identity V.
[1:48:34] <%tumzfestival> Jack from RE7 was acting like he was playing this game already hehe
[1:48:37] <+captain_elsewhere> PH is good Captain_Doomsday trust me ive been playing a while
[1:48:38] <rissaleigh14> Ayyy you got it
[1:48:38] <%Ner234> LUL
[1:48:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> yeet
[1:48:42] <%Kataguro> Almost made it
[1:48:44] <%Ner234> yoink
[1:48:45] <FirearmsInstructor> lmao
[1:48:47] <%Aydarkzero> @Mortal_Wombat_I they do that they lose any player population in Resistance they can't even use Tyrant
[1:48:47] <Captain_Doomsday> Right, yes! Identity V is basically this same game for free on mobile, everyone.
[1:48:50] <rissaleigh14> How close
[1:48:52] <%Shadicara> To the hook ye go
[1:48:54] <%ryome> Oh goodie- St. Cloud
[1:48:57] <%Scooterbug9000> got'em
[1:49:00] <HarraceHarrison> And an EGC kill for your challenge
[1:49:01] <wix964> Mr X would have to have a constant incredibly loud STOMP STOMP STOMP accompanying him lol
[1:49:04] <Captain_Doomsday> Except the killers are cooler in ID-V
[1:49:04] <+evbites> @Mortal_Wombat_I nah that would be an oc called mutant
[1:49:05] <%tumzfestival> BOB from TWIN PEAKS
[1:49:07] <%Shadicara> Who needs friends when you have a hook
[1:49:10] <%Aydarkzero> Bob monkaS
[1:49:11] <Dragon_Batman> Congrats
[1:49:13] <+luomato> I really need to get back into this game, loved playing Michael myers
[1:49:13] <%GrumblePlays> Mr X or Jack Baker would be really cool in DBD but since RE has Resistance I doubt it woudl happen
[1:49:18] <+tigerfang86> R U T H L E S S
[1:49:18] <DamnGoodCake> easy peasy lemon STABBY
[1:49:18] <rissaleigh14> Good job
[1:49:19] <jimmytwofeet> AAAURGHHA
[1:49:20] <%Kaji04> MURDER
[1:49:20] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Have you play Last Year: The Nightmare, its like this.
[1:49:21] <ChoculaUltra> Another win for Satan!
[1:49:21] <@SoFarFetched> "This place is off the hook!"
[1:49:22] <%Starotter70> Bob still scares the shit outta me
[1:49:22] <SoySocks> gj
[1:49:24] <Silly_Duckling> @Captain_Doomsday Correct, it's just that initial phase where he will probably lose at least 1 gen, after that, he's probably better than Billy, but not before. both are probably at a similar tier
[1:49:26] <jase__x> Good game
[1:49:28] <+akira_chong> So which killer is Pat right now?
[1:49:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> woo
[1:49:29] <primaryfire> the hook sound played while I was watching a clip where you drank from a mug
[1:49:30] <primaryfire> hate that
[1:49:33] <Reanimator83> When are they going to add the Tall Man from “Phantasm” in this
[1:49:34] <%Scooterbug9000> legion @akira_chong
[1:49:36] <%GohanHitsugaya> GG
[1:49:37] <Captain_Doomsday> Imagine Killer BOB just getting teabagged around a pallet.
[1:49:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> @akira_chong Origami
[1:49:42] <%Piemen99> damn you hate to see it
[1:49:43] <%GalacticLatte> As a Legion main I NEVER get daily's for Legion FeelsBadMan
[1:49:44] <legacy0117> The Pat man. x3
[1:49:44] <%PirateMike_> Can you show off The Spirit
[1:49:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @Shadicara That's what I keep telling my psychologist!!! Glad someone gets it.
[1:49:49] <%Mornaka> Mornaka subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:49:50] <+akira_chong> @scooterbug9000 thanks
[1:49:55] <dinnydanny777> They should add the Raincoat Killer from Deadly Premonition
[1:49:57] <Hoot_Patoots> the yeehaw man
[1:50:01] <%GalacticLatte> @PatStaresAt Not gonna save your bloodpoints for The Executioner?
[1:50:03] <+BloodyBurney> so who's pat"s favorite?
[1:50:07] <seclusivechain1> yoooooooo, is that a Mfing ghost cowboy?
[1:50:08] <%Piemen99> Oh man this gun has a GUN Dope
[1:50:12] <Wondabarrapa> top tier insidious plays
[1:50:14] <%PlagueOfGripes> Hunt Showdown man is at level 48
[1:50:15] <%GalacticLatte> @BloodyBurney Hilllbilly I believe
[1:50:18] <%Scooterbug9000> he likes the hillbilly @BloodyBurney
[1:50:25] <%tumzfestival> DYK Bob from Twin Peaks worked on the crew and Lynch like the image of him in Laura's room- So he asked if he happened to be an actor, but wasn't sure what part he'd play until they finished editing the pilot....
[1:50:26] <wix964> I don't understand this perk system
[1:50:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Is Deathslinger any good? His power seems to be gimping himself for a prayer at getting one Survivor closer.
[1:50:34] <jnapier42> they should add richard nixon
[1:50:35] <ChoculaUltra> wait, there's a killer with a GUN? Isn't that like, not allowed for slasher flicks
[1:50:35] <%Aydarkzero> whens the Graboid being added?
[1:50:35] <%manwithboxonhead> Imagine if they added the Orgiami Killer from Heavy Rain.
[1:50:39] <Captain_Doomsday> Deathslinger and Clown seem like worse Huntresses.
[1:50:41] <+Excelumin> Monstrous Shrine LUL
[1:50:48] <%Starotter70> WAIT GUYS, Mystery Inc. as Survivors!
[1:50:48] <%tumzfestival> Bob from Twin Peaks was unplanned...........
[1:50:57] <%GalacticLatte> @manwithboxonhead The Clown is the closest thing LOL
[1:50:59] <Silly_Duckling> Deathslinger is worse Huntress, yeah, basically
[1:51:00] <rissaleigh14> I might get back into this game to see what facing Deathslinger is like
[1:51:01] <Captain_Doomsday> The mori, Pat!
[1:51:03] <underFreddy> Deathslinger doesn't seem to be based on any horror archetype. Or am I just dumb on the genre
[1:51:07] <Captain_Doomsday> Perpetuate the cycle of hate!
[1:51:09] <XdaXcaptainX> huntress has a much steeper learning curve than either
[1:51:19] <dinnydanny777> This guy isn't even scary
[1:51:20] <%PirateMike_> This monster is a total "Saint of Killers" ripoff
[1:51:21] <%GalacticLatte> Pop is one of the best perks in the game currently
[1:51:22] <%Kataguro> Play With Your Food is cool
[1:51:23] <+captain_elsewhere> clown is absolute garbiage @Captain_Doomsday slinger can at least semi reliable down people at pallets
[1:51:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @wix964 Each killer has a random web you have to play commonly grinded materials known as blood points to move along the web and unlock ablities
[1:51:25] <Wondabarrapa> play with your food can be good though
[1:51:26] <%Scooterbug9000> coffvvee

[1:59:41] <Axle13j> WutFace
[1:59:43] <Captain_Doomsday> @captain_elsewhere I figured with Last Year and REsistance getting shot down BHVR would feel no need to actually make the game better.
[1:59:45] <legacy0117> Oh Pat. Silly.
[1:59:47] <SomeOtherNeb> WOAAAH

[2:00:00] <%Valdorick> Dat Netcode
[2:00:01] <%PlagueOfGripes> that hook looks really unreliable
[2:00:06] <dinnydanny777> I like how this character just has the power of having a really really bad gun
[2:00:07] <Captain_Doomsday> He's Deathslinger. Second newest char.
[2:00:08] <+mikesapartment> aiming good helps
[2:00:13] <legacy0117> YEAH. GUN....AND MISS.
[2:00:14] <+BKNPham> psaCrazyhand

[2:00:32] <+BloodyBurney> trick shot
[2:00:32] <Silly_Duckling> The deadslinger's spear is actually SUPER precise, the survivor hitboxes aren't
[2:00:32] <KeystoneA2> Woolie Aim: Engage
[2:00:33] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes That's why Pat calls it "Ol' Unreliable" though it does seem like you REALLY need to be precise with it.
[2:00:34] <%Tearonex> wiff LUL
[2:00:35] <+NitronStreams> remember even with a mouse someone can have shitty aim
[2:00:37] <jase__x> That Woolie Aim

[2:00:50] <BluBox> Trying to MW2 quickscope with these shots
[2:00:50] <@SoFarFetched> Pat missed the testing for PH

[2:00:52] <%BoneofMalkav> Heeeeah!

[2:00:55] <jase__x> lmao right into the tree
[2:00:55] <dinnydanny777> Yyayayay
[2:00:57] <%SirGO0SE> heeeeeeeeeeeee

[2:01:00] <%SirGO0SE> yaaaaaa
[2:01:00] <Axle13j> those grunts lmao
[2:01:01] <fuji_92> hiiiahs
[2:01:02] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Livelinne yes it is just its still in the ptb not in the main

[2:01:04] <SomeOtherNeb> HIIIYAA
[2:01:06] <%Livelinne> @pectusumbra I see, thanks!
[2:01:06] <Bonte__> @Livelinne He's releasing soon, he was on the test server earlier.
[2:01:08] <%Aydarkzero> a girl & her favorite generator nice
[2:01:09] <sharpington_> Kinda surprised Pat's not playing pyramid head, did he try him out and not like him?
[2:01:14] <+BloodyBurney> this killer seems dope
[2:01:18] <jase__x> some link noises
[2:01:21] <Dragon_Batman> I thought the plague woman was the newest
[2:01:21] <%SirGO0SE> she talks crazy talk
[2:01:26] <legacy0117> Wh as t if you hit someone in the head with a harpoon shot?
[2:01:26] <rissaleigh14> PH isn’t out yet
[2:01:28] <%spiritofmojave> @sharpington_ he's not out yet
[2:01:30] <rufus2k2> what killer is this?
[2:01:32] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes Pat would pretty much have to shoot the survivor right in the face to get a secure hit,unless its got like Xcom percentages behind it.
[2:01:32] <NoirePanzer> When's vommy mommy
[2:01:33] <SomeOtherNeb> @sharpington_ think it's not available anymore, the beta ended
[2:01:36] <%Tearonex> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:01:36] <%Livelinne> @lwpabloelenano2hc See, I should’ve checked first. Ty!
[2:01:37] <%GalacticLatte> @PlagueOfGripes You can predict it and you can mind game survivors by just holding the aim and make them walk where you want
[2:01:38] <Captain_Doomsday> This Killer is like Huntress but for COD addicts
[2:01:40] <sharpington_> oooooh that explains it thanks gang
[2:01:44] <%Livelinne> Thanks guys!
[2:01:51] <+SlightlySychotic> They closed the PTB and he releases on the 16th.
[2:01:56] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Captain_Doomsday and more blue baller
[2:02:02] <%PlagueOfGripes> amazing
[2:02:12] <%Ner234> It bothers me a bit that Pat's overlay always cuts off something.
[2:02:15] <%Kaji04> why are you not hitting that guy?
[2:02:16] <%Starotter70> Heeeeeeeeee
[2:02:18] <rufus2k2> that laugh reminds me of Caleb from Blood
[2:02:18] <Dragon_Batman> Neat there is a release date
[2:02:20] <%Dementedpenguin> David at least actually block the path, not run past it......
[2:02:22] <@SoFarFetched> Because of the obsession perk
[2:02:23] <%GalacticLatte> The best part of DeathSlinger is his laugh
[2:02:23] <Axle13j> HEEE
[2:02:30] <%Livelinne> @bonte__ I see, that’s neat tho. Thanks
[2:02:31] <%SirGO0SE> that "HEEEE" is the sound i make before a poopy
[2:02:36] <%PirateMike_> Sneaky boi
[2:02:39] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, Pat needs a top corner webcam if he's going to stream this regularly. Everyone's status is a big part of the game.
[2:03:03] <rufus2k2> oh fuck it is Caleb, just not THAT Caleb
[2:03:03] <Dragon_Batman> True
[2:03:06] <rufus2k2> what a coincidence
[2:03:07] <underFreddy> the power of not panic sprinting
[2:03:09] <rufus2k2> or is it
[2:03:10] <%Ner234> The bottom left of the screen is were most games put hud stuff. he should change it.
[2:03:16] <legacy0117> Call of Duty addicts, unfortunately includes Fortnite addicts too, so basically the majority of the shooting game addicts out there.
[2:03:26] <+EySoyCoco> yoink
[2:03:27] <heart_ablaze> all the weird moans and noises people make in this game is really funny to me and I don't know why

[2:03:33] <rufus2k2> you grabbed her by the butt!
[2:03:37] <Bonte__> Mighty unfortunate that is.

[2:03:49] <@SoFarFetched> sounds like she's trying to do karate moves but doing horribly LUL
[2:03:55] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[2:03:57] <@SoFarFetched> with all this "HIYAHH"
[2:04:03] <rufus2k2> I wonder if the DBD devs have thought about making a single player horror game
[2:04:04] <ChoculaUltra> did they add a survivor with Ghostface? Like Sidney Prescott? Randy?
[2:04:05] <Dragon_Batman> I thought the same
[2:04:06] <%Livelinne> Voices are hilarious LUL
[2:04:17] <underFreddy> Ghostface is by himself
[2:04:22] <ChoculaUltra> ah lame.
[2:04:24] <%kewlmyc> MIND GAMES
[2:04:25] <%BoneofMalkav> LUL
[2:04:27] <%PirateMike_> I want a horror game where instead of just killing people you need to jumpscare them do death

[2:04:38] <%TheActuallyGuy> nice. maxed out your stbfl
[2:04:42] <encrouched> When are they gonna add AM to this game?
[2:04:43] <%GalacticLatte> Kick a gen pat for Pop value
[2:04:48] <ChoculaUltra> ah I see
[2:04:51] <venomfury86> this guy reminds me of Caleb from Blood
[2:04:52] <Dragon_Batman> Ooo fucked up the check?
[2:04:55] <DamnGoodCake> psaCanada
[2:04:57] <BunnyEmperor> went right
[2:04:57] <+captain_elsewhere> also its not even any ghostface from any of the movies @ChoculaUltra its just the costume
[2:05:02] <%GrumblePlays> @PirateMike_ there are games like that, I think Hide & Shriek is one of them
[2:05:06] <%SirGO0SE> OMG he was RIGHT next to you
[2:05:07] <StarkMaximum> heh. killin' it.
[2:05:13] <rufus2k2> @PirateMike_ so a better version of Gamecube's Geist?

[2:05:17] <ChoculaUltra> that takes the wind out of my Scream loving sails
[2:05:18] <Cactuskris> why would you ever play survivor with randos if they basically kill you even if you´re a good survivor
[2:05:18] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> she has ds..
[2:05:21] <Captain_Doomsday> Hide & Shriek is a F2P on Steam.
[2:05:22] <@SoFarFetched> man this place is literally poppin'g off with all those explosions
[2:05:23] <dkthefriend> I don't think Ash came with a Killer either

[2:09:41] <%xcompleasedad> That is wrong?
[2:09:43] <+WarbossMetal> Why does that Zombie Ghost have a sword?
[2:09:43] <rufus2k2> Big cats can

[2:10:10] <+AnthraxJohnson> I bet Elmo smells like Smelmo
[2:10:10] <dkthefriend> rats can't swim, thats why they needed boats to get here
[2:10:12] <studleydoorite> Pat projecting his inability to swim to cats
[2:10:13] <%patriotrenegade> Impressive. Almost everything you said was incorrect.
[2:10:14] <socratetris> rats are actually remarkable swimmers though
[2:10:15] <+EyeFarted> I want to glue her back together... with my semen
[2:10:15] <rufus2k2> is this dogs can talk again
[2:10:15] <rissaleigh14> Pat is super wrong

[2:10:46] <%MisterRockett> Lifeguard training!?
[2:10:46] <+TOONFOOD> the orb is buoyant
[2:10:46] <StarkMaximum> That thing Pat just said sounds like the sort of thing someone who was wrong told Pat and he never looked it up and assumed it was true because he can't comprehend why anyone would lie to him
[2:10:46] <srkAres> pats orb makes him float
[2:10:47] <RevolverBobkat> Is it The Lying hour?
[2:10:48] <%xxshadowxx416> pat a big fat cat
[2:10:48] <Captain_Doomsday> Pat does look buoyant.
[2:10:49] <%Piemen99> wow new lore
[2:10:49] <%PirateMike_> When was the last time you swam
[2:10:49] <rissaleigh14> Prove it
[2:10:49] <+not_draven> new lore?
[2:10:49] <%Treuan> It's a pretty boring job
[2:10:50] <%walternatorz> it looks like pat filled his brain with shit since shitting it out last night
[2:10:50] <%spiritofmojave> A LANDWELLING FISH MAYBE
[2:10:51] <WolfemanMaverik> it does suck
[2:10:51] <+EyeFarted> a puffer fish
[2:10:52] <%Plus_On_Black> Fish ass Patt lol

[2:10:57] <@SoFarFetched> Plague tail
[2:10:58] <%spiritofmojave> THEY CAN THO
[2:11:02] <fuji_92> yeah, y'all need to study the L O R E
[2:11:02] <%StaceMcGate> Pat wouldn't give you CPR, he'd just call it on the scene
[2:11:02] <absentking> RATS CAN SWIM PAT
[2:11:02] <%manwithboxonhead> Lore Unlocked.
[2:11:02] <encrouched> Orb lifeguard
[2:11:03] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Lifeguard training????
[2:11:03] <%Scooterbug9000> true
[2:11:03] <%BubbaRands> Its not baywatch thats for sure...
[2:11:04] <rufus2k2> big sigh
[2:11:04] <%YakumoYomi> The orb is buoyant
[2:11:04] <%Jhylla81> FISH CAN SWIM?
[2:11:05] <BluBox> Baywatch Pat
[2:11:06] <%Starotter70> But, what if you were a Buffass Lifegaurd tho!?
[2:11:07] <Dragon_Batman> I think they were just lazy
[2:11:07] <ChoculaUltra> sounds logical enough.
[2:11:08] <%IncredibleMeh> rat learn to swim from boat
[2:11:09] <studleydoorite> but people can swim and they built the boats
[2:11:10] <%Valdorick> Rat Facts
[2:11:10] <+Walopoh> That's not how oceans workj
[2:11:12] <rufus2k2> wipe hands clean
[2:11:13] <%D00msDayDan> fish aren't real
[2:11:14] <dkthefriend> they took the boats from europe
[2:11:14] <%walternatorz> it's basic arithmetic
[2:11:15] <+xmetalicdemonx> Than we would all be dead.
[2:11:15] <venomfury86> fair point
[2:11:16] <+beardy_foxbear> GALAXY BRAIN
[2:11:16] <+Ondartyr> So humans can't swim either?
[2:11:17] <Axle13j> oh fuck he's right doodBigBrain
[2:11:17] <%PlagueOfGripes> what about those rats that swam from africa to south america prior to humanity existing as a species
[2:11:18] <+Snorlax321> rats cant swim across an ocean
[2:11:18] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt THEN WHY DO HUMANS NEED BOATS
[2:11:18] <rufus2k2> and exit convo
[2:11:19] <%scrumbotime> I can confirm, if you have Orb swimming is second nature. You're bouyant and powerful if you are Enorbed in the water.
[2:11:19] <%spiritofmojave> Pat, rats don't have compasses
[2:11:20] <%PirateMike_> IF RATS SWIM THE FISH WALK
[2:11:20] <broaches> humans can't swim, otherwise they wouldn't need to take the boats to europ LUL
[2:11:22] <CatmanIX> so does that mean people can't swim either?
[2:11:23] <%dave323dave> true facts from patrick boivin
[2:11:24] <fuji_92> it's basic math really
[2:11:24] <%Tearonex> the logic is sound
[2:11:24] <%Ner234> FACTS
[2:11:25] <Thewoodentree> They didnt take a boat, they hitched a ride on the mongol invasion
[2:11:27] <+EyeFarted> FROM WHERE!?!?
[2:11:28] <%spiritofmojave> but they can swim
[2:11:29] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> THEY JUST CAN'T SWIM SEAS PAT
[2:11:29] <DamnGoodCake> @PatStaresAt But people can swim and we still take the boat. Rats are just lazy like us!
[2:11:30] <ChoculaUltra> does that mean rats are rather skilled boatsmen?
[2:11:34] <EuropanLamprey> I know this is a bit, but I want to spam Pat's twitter with videos of Rats swimming
[2:11:34] <%ElkRiverDog> Dude my mom’s cat was in our local paper because some tourist discovered that she liked to swim.
[2:11:34] <%Piemono> Prove it
[2:11:41] <dkthefriend> rats used to know, but they forgot
[2:11:41] <%Starotter70> Rats can't pilot a boat
[2:11:42] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt why did humans need boats to get to america if we can swim
[2:11:44] <%PlagueOfGripes> Paige is awake. Don't let her move
[2:11:44] <Sir_Dolphinian> can you swim all the way to the EU?
[2:11:45] <%Livelinne> psaSmug_FF
[2:11:51] <rissaleigh14> Can you swim that good?
[2:11:54] <dkthefriend> like how whales used to know how to have hooves
[2:11:55] <%Ner234> She's ALIVE>
[2:11:57] <Dragon_Batman> Good day to her
[2:11:58] <+captain_elsewhere> jusst blow up the ocean
[2:11:58] <encrouched> Rat do have instant transmission, but they cant touch their forehead to activate it
[2:11:59] <%BubbaRands> Yep cause we all know humans swam hundreds of miles to get to the new worlds
[2:11:59] <@SoFarFetched> She's play "YOU'RE PLAYING WITHOUT MEEEUUHHH"
[2:12:00] <Captain_Doomsday> I wish each Killer had its own ranking.
[2:12:01] <%Mitchellsocks> The wiki has Ash listed as originating from "2015's Ash vs the Evil Dead" and frankly I find that insulting
[2:12:01] <%patriotrenegade> do u want a video of a rat or a cat swimming, or....?
[2:12:04] <%Starotter70> She has arisen once more
[2:12:04] <AFlyingTaco1> I mean they can swim short distances
[2:12:04] <%Scooterbug9000> tell her hello @PatStaresAt
[2:12:04] <%weissguard> Hopefully she isn't in too much pain today.
[2:12:04] <rissaleigh14> Hi Peaches
[2:12:06] <srkAres> good morning paige
[2:12:07] <StarkMaximum> oh this POV is UNCOMFORTABLE
[2:12:07] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Starting
[2:12:08] <Captain_Doomsday> aaaaaand 3 gens done
[2:12:09] <%YakumoYomi> You heard Plague: restrain the Mustard Queen.
[2:12:13] <ChoculaUltra> the bride of skeletor has awakened monkaS
[2:12:14] <%Tearonex> I'm sure this is fine
[2:12:14] <Captain_Doomsday> GIVE EM THE WIGGLES
[2:12:15] <%patriotrenegade> does it say "rats can totally swim you dumb nerd?"
[2:12:15] <@SoFarFetched> Ring u not Ringu LUL
[2:12:15] <+Snorlax321> water fucks with a cats balance so they usually hate it
[2:12:20] <%PirateMike_> Help her with the sex
[2:12:20] <%Ynkubus18> on a stretcher
[2:12:21] <venomfury86> Can rats talk?
[2:12:22] <Thewoodentree> RATS CANT SWIM WATCH AN AMERICAN TAIL: FIVEL GOES WEST
[2:12:22] <%Jekado> RINGU
[2:12:22] <Superior_Spidermon> Not Hisako
[2:12:22] <%Keyd00d> Pat it's ringu not ringyu
[2:12:23] <%walternatorz> is paige's back still broken?
[2:12:24] <+NitronStreams> ringyoo
[2:12:24] <tusk102> patuhhhhhhh
[2:12:27] <%SaiyanShoto> With dick
[2:12:27] <rosemon5001> demon rats cant regular rats can crossing the ocean is a whole other thing
[2:12:29] <%Scooterbug9000> tiger actually like to swim @PatStaresAt
[2:12:29] <%Starotter70> Did she fall on her butthole again?
[2:12:31] <%Overloard> most land mammals cant swim cross oceans but are still capable of swimming
[2:12:45] <ChoculaUltra> I like her hand placement
[2:12:49] <%manwithboxonhead> The hand movement is unsettling.
[2:12:57] <%Ner234> Paige's butthole is in a perpetual state of ruin. Pray for this poor woman.
[2:12:57] <Dr_Suddenboner> is pyramid head in the game yet?
[2:12:59] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Paige is unfortunately having more trouble moving
[2:13:08] <@SoFarFetched> and no not yet,think a week or two until he comes out.
[2:13:09] <%Mendin> That sounded exactly like Paige
[2:13:09] <%PirateMike_> lol that ghost yell is hilarious
[2:13:09] <srkAres> MYAAA
[2:13:12] <%Mister_McDerp> jermaChomp AAAaaaa
[2:13:20] <jase__x> The ghost is just Paige
[2:13:21] <%spiritofmojave> HEEEEE
[2:13:21] <%GalacticLatte> Her sword is made up of the shards of glass that her dad used to kill and sever her with
[2:13:25] <%Scooterbug9000> hopefully paige gets better soon :(
[2:13:34] <+AXL808> so that's how phasewalk works, I thought it was more like Nurse teleport
[2:13:35] <%BubbaRands> good job
[2:13:36] <ChoculaUltra> thats sick as hell - ghost glass sword
[2:13:37] <Dragon_Batman> Something happened to Paige?
[2:13:38] <@SoFarFetched> those swords fill her up with honor
[2:13:40] <tusk102> wait what happened to paige
[2:13:41] <AFlyingTaco1> @galacticlatte That's metal
[2:13:42] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt have you done the classisc void walk and stand still juke? never works for me
[2:13:45] <rissaleigh14> LUL
[2:13:46] <%PirateMike_> @Dragon_Batman She died
[2:13:50] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah hope Baige's butt gets unwrecked
[2:13:58] <socratetris> Does her sword play VHS or Betamax?
[2:13:59] <%crimsonharvest> oh man tom morello is dunking on clowns again today i love it
[2:14:00] <legacy0117> Dang she takes down in one swing? I think?
[2:14:02] <+AnthraxJohnson> What does phase walk do?
[2:14:03] <StarkMaximum> So are the survivors rescuing the people who get hooked? Isn't the hook going through them? Does that not kill them? (I've never seen this game played)
[2:14:03] <%Starotter70> @Dragon_Batman Her lower backs been fucked for like a week or two now
[2:14:04] <Dragon_Batman> @PirateMike_ The Mustard in her veins won't let her
[2:14:06] <%GalacticLatte> @AFlyingTaco1 The lore for her is pretty sad but the concept of her is awesome
[2:14:19] <+captain_elsewhere> yeah dont use phase to hit uninjured survivors
[2:14:21] <%ChaosAethr> WE see
[2:14:21] <tusk102> @AnthraxJohnson lets you walk and phase Kappa
[2:14:24] <%Jekado> Predictaboo
[2:14:27] <Captain_Doomsday> Uh ohhhhh
[2:14:27] <%GalacticLatte> @AFlyingTaco1 In fact most of the killers have a really bad past
[2:14:27] <ChoculaUltra> you think actual serial killers would be decent at playing killer in this?
[2:14:28] <legacy0117> Phase walk does what it says I assume.
[2:14:36] <Thewoodentree> lol that pause and stare
[2:14:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> ded
[2:14:40] <Dragon_Batman> @Starotter70 Aaah shame to hear hope she gets better quick
[2:14:46] <@SoFarFetched> @StarkMaximum When you play as the Survivor the hook IS through them,when they get off the hook they are still injured and can be healed. I believe once you've been hooked 3 times, its a for sure death.
[2:14:48] <legacy0117> Phasing through obstacles and walls.
[2:14:49] <%DappercatEsquire> How come when she does creepy Ringu/VHS shit it's "cool" but when I do it my girlfriend says it's "lame" and "get out of my apartment"
[2:14:50] <%ChaosAethr> Mind Game
[2:14:54] <Captain_Doomsday> Actual serial killers don't run around with melee weapons in plain sight and a magical heartbeat
[2:14:56] <Silly_Duckling> Spirit's power phases her into another plane where she can't be seen by survivors and gets a speed boost, leaving a copy of her behind to stand there. Thing is, she can't see the survivors in the plane either, so she has to listen for them.
[2:15:00] <%TioXyco> OH! Pat-cam is back
[2:15:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Zandatsu
[2:15:07] <StarkMaximum> @SoFarFetched I too tend to die when I get stabbed three times.
[2:15:07] <Hoot_Patoots> oh shit are we playing a japanese ghost
[2:15:07] <%GalacticLatte> @PatStaresAt You need to use your pop at times dude LOL
[2:15:09] <%Ner234> @DappercatEsquire monkaS
[2:15:11] <Mr_Strut> Pat using his psych degree to cheat in video games
[2:15:12] <ChoculaUltra> oh right, uhm, real spree killers then?
[2:15:15] <%Valdorick> Bad juke, Surv Bruh
[2:15:18] <%Jekado> that was a bad juke
[2:15:18] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, we're Not The Grudge
[2:15:19] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> @TioXyco AC FIXED
[2:15:19] <legacy0117> And yeah, she totally knocks people down in one swing.
[2:15:22] <encrouched> Knife to meet you
[2:15:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Captain_Doomsday Thats a badtake if ive ever seen one
[2:15:26] <@SoFarFetched> Once you pop you just can't stop.
[2:15:26] <rissaleigh14> Oof
[2:15:27] <%ChaosAethr> What was that persons plan
[2:15:31] <Hoot_Patoots> my favourite movie, not the grudge
[2:15:35] <tusk102> wow she breaks shit fast
[2:15:36] <%Scooterbug9000> dang hes slugging
[2:15:36] <%Starotter70> The balls
[2:15:40] <%Valdorick> The bad juke
[2:15:42] <%Scooterbug9000> I disapprove
[2:15:43] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt You seem to be doing MUCH better with this one
[2:15:47] <+UltraViolet371> I love the image of an evil spirit kicking the shit out of a generator
[2:15:52] <encrouched> its a knife day for a knife wedding
[2:15:54] <Silly_Duckling> Spirit is top tier
[2:15:55] <%Starotter70> Heyaaaaaah
[2:15:56] <Captain_Doomsday> She uses her katana
[2:16:00] <sexdrugsvideogames> ouch
[2:16:01] <+heretostream> Nothing wrong with slugging
[2:16:10] <rissaleigh14> He’s been playing mostly bad killers
[2:16:16] <legacy0117> She also has a Katana, which is pretty cool too.
[2:16:20] <rissaleigh14> This is a good one
[2:16:22] <%DappercatEsquire> She study the way of the blade
[2:16:22] <Hoot_Patoots> just beat the shit out of rubble with a sword
[2:16:23] <encrouched> knife try
[2:16:29] <%Mister_McDerp> damn thats a good ability
[2:16:30] <%GalacticLatte> @AFlyingTaco1 One thing you should note is that there is a killer in this game called Oni and he is Spirits ancestor, he literally fills her with rage as a kid to beat a bunch of bullies to near death
[2:16:33] <Dragon_Batman> Is it?
[2:16:35] <tusk102> the palette breaking animation is terrible lol
[2:16:36] <Stofil42> i was about to say she seems really strong
[2:16:37] <Silly_Duckling> Like, I think only nurse is really any competition to Spirit
[2:16:37] <j0ustar> you THOUGHT
[2:16:37] <Cymen90> Top Waifu indeed
[2:16:40] <%GalacticLatte> Nurse then Spirit
[2:16:41] <ChoculaUltra> all these knife puns are really cutting me down guys
[2:16:41] <+captain_elsewhere> no, best killer is nurse but nurse is insanely hard to use
[2:16:42] <%weissguard> She seems pretty good. Good walk speed at least.
[2:16:42] <Captain_Doomsday> Top tier, arguable #1
[2:16:46] <legacy0117> Ice Katana? It seems.
[2:16:46] <%PirateMike_> Walking through walls helps
[2:16:50] <madogod> pat the tier whore
[2:16:50] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you don't think nurse is better?
[2:16:51] <%ChaosAethr> I can see why
[2:16:52] <%Plus_On_Black> Why is she the best?
[2:16:54] <encrouched> sugar, spice, and everything KNIFE
[2:16:54] <+BloodyBurney> high skill high reward?
[2:17:04] <Captain_Doomsday> Freddy, Oni, Nurse and Billy compete for top.
[2:17:04] <Dragon_Batman> Ooh yea Nurse has the teleport swipe right?
[2:17:05] <%DappercatEsquire> crepey
[2:17:05] <rissaleigh14> Didn’t nurse get nerfed?
[2:17:12] <Zombrocom> She is covered in shards of glass that pop out and form into a sword, it's kinda rad
[2:17:12] <Captain_Doomsday> Nurse had her addons reworked
[2:17:13] <%GalacticLatte> The Nurse and The Spirit are like contesting number 1, but I'd say Spirit is way easier to play
[2:17:13] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @GalacticLatte yeah thats why her father kil her and her mother
[2:17:15] <+Skelegroove> Pat misses a lot of survivors moving in the background
[2:17:18] <%TioXyco> lag movements
[2:17:20] <Hoot_Patoots> i love ow her sword disintegrates
[2:17:25] <StarkMaximum> If someone happens upon where your body appears to be can they fuck with you and end it early
[2:17:26] <%GalacticLatte> @rissaleigh14 She did but she can still go through walls LOL
[2:17:29] <Dragon_Batman> Wow Freddy jumped from worst to first?
[2:17:29] <ChoculaUltra> thats that streamer blindness for ya
[2:17:29] <Thewoodentree> WHAT
[2:17:31] <srkAres> Super Sonico?
[2:17:35] <rissaleigh14> Fair enough
[2:17:36] <%Jekado> why?
[2:17:37] <%GalacticLatte> @lwpabloelenano2hc Yup
[2:17:40] <@SoFarFetched> damn
[2:17:41] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you don't think nurse is better?
[2:17:42] <%DappercatEsquire> Is it just like an instant blink, or are there creepy transition movements between the start location and the final location?
[2:17:42] <Captain_Doomsday> Sadako
[2:17:44] <legacy0117> Yeah, I got that impression.
[2:17:48] <+WarbossMetal> Nah, huntress with her one hit kill axes is the best, unless that was changed
[2:17:48] <Stofil42> who's the worst right now, is it the clown?
[2:17:51] <SaltyAzteca> Sack Ree Feist!
[2:17:52] <%Jekado> these survivors are being like... movie... survivors...
[2:17:52] <legacy0117> Pretty sweet.
[2:17:59] <%ChaosAethr> There just too FREE
[2:18:00] <%GalacticLatte> Nurse is defacto better but way harder to master
[2:18:00] <%Buzzard42> Buzzard42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! psaGib
[2:18:05] <@SSaryn> LUL
[2:18:06] <broaches> @WarbossMetal you need a specific "rare" add-on for that though
[2:18:09] <@SoFarFetched> oooo nice
[2:18:11] <%Starotter70> Ah
[2:18:11] <Captain_Doomsday> @DappercatEsquire You can hear Spirit phasing if she's far and see grass move when she passes through it.
[2:18:17] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you don't think nurse is better than spirit?
[2:18:17] <%MisterRockett> Would you say that makes it mechanically a teleport or mechanically a dash?
[2:18:20] <+theKingRamses> you can also hear survivor audio
[2:18:21] <+captain_elsewhere> you are effectively invisible during phase DappercatEsquire
[2:18:24] <Covil91> How many humans are there? I swear you've killed like 7 since I got here
[2:18:28] <BlkFlameKami> NOTHING PERSONAL
[2:18:32] <rissaleigh14> I could see that, saw a lot of bad nurse killers at low ranks
[2:18:35] <Dragon_Batman> There is only 4 people
[2:18:37] <%Jekado> mechianically its would be a dash because you can't walk through objects
[2:18:38] <Silly_Duckling> Killers are generally rated without perks or addons, (if an addon drastically changes something, then it might be noted).
[2:18:38] <%xcompleasedad> @MisterRockett Sprint
[2:18:40] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt man her palette breaking animations not great huh?
[2:18:47] <%TheActuallyGuy> is there no terror radius when phase walking?
[2:18:47] <%GalacticLatte> @rissaleigh14 Yeah Nurse isn't a low rank killer at all
[2:18:50] <%Ner234> @Covil91 It's 4. you have to hook them 3 times.
[2:18:51] <Cymen90> @Covil91 4. They can be saved from hooks by their friends
[2:18:54] <FirearmsInstructor> Do you physically bump into them or do you go through them in phasewalk?
[2:18:55] <Captain_Doomsday> Nurse, Hag and Huntress are the highest skill/reward
[2:18:58] <GarettLefebvre> your movement speed seems to increase too
[2:19:07] <%DappercatEsquire> I can see how that's more useful, but man it would be cool to see her blink and contort little by little towards you super quickly
[2:19:08] <%GalacticLatte> Hag is also one of the best killers in the game
[2:19:10] <SaltyAzteca> Hang around for a while 4Head
[2:19:10] <Nomad_Scholar> Now Now, back to your hook
[2:19:11] <%Ner234> @Covil91 Or one if no one saves them
[2:19:14] <Captain_Doomsday> Spirit and Freddy have some of the best map pressure.
[2:19:18] <Irkallu> That finger thing she keeps doing is kinda creepy
[2:19:23] <+theKingRamses> @TheActuallyGuy sorta, there's a slight audio cue if she's phasing right next to you i think
[2:19:23] <legacy0117> Too b as d there isn't a tournament mode for hunters in this game.
[2:19:23] <rissaleigh14> And saw a lot of good Spirit ones
[2:19:25] <+captain_elsewhere> her husk has a TR but if you are in the TR you dont hear the phase sound effect @TheActuallyGuy
[2:19:32] <Covil91> Feels like it'd be better to just slit their throat
[2:19:33] <Captain_Doomsday> @DappercatEsquire Spirit's normal walking has her phase and "stutter-step"
[2:19:35] <%GalacticLatte> Hag is completely underrated because people don't find her "fun to play"
[2:19:36] <legacy0117> That'd be fun.
[2:19:36] <+AXL808> how do you juke Spirit?

[2:20:37] <SaltyAzteca> I got you hook line and sinker 4Head
[2:20:37] <Silly_Duckling> Nurse is good because she ignores the one thing survivors have to stop killers: palettes
[2:20:40] <broaches> at most you can hear the "wind" sound as a survivor while the killer is phase walking
[2:20:41] <%GalacticLatte> Spirit also has the best combination of add ons that make her the best killer
[2:20:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> AAAAAA-
[2:20:44] <Dragon_Batman> HAve a good one Cozy
[2:20:49] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Oh man is Pat winning?

[2:20:54] <+Skelegroove> It feels like phase walk should have a delay on exit
[2:20:57] <+GarrusAngel> Anyone excited for Pyramid Head?
[2:21:01] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you don't think nurse is better than spirit?
[2:21:01] <%GalacticLatte> Yakuyoke Amulet and Mother-Daughter Ring make her actually unfair
[2:21:02] <Captain_Doomsday> Pat appears to be at baby ranks so he's crushing it.

[2:27:51] <encrouched> Pat is actually just part of the paranormal activity cult and this is the first step
[2:28:04] <+bugz_munny> They were on a trip, there was a 2 day old cheesecake out, and woolie ate it day 3

[2:28:15] <+UltraViolet371> oh man they should add literally any killer or monster from the Evil Within. Stefano would mechanically be sick in particular

[2:37:41] <@SoFarFetched> Welcome to the Billy Club
[2:37:41] <rissaleigh14> Ooh mori time
[2:37:42] <themisticmist2000> OH NOOOO
[2:37:45] <Nomad_Scholar> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna tell the survivors to squeal like a pig?
[2:37:48] <Captain_Doomsday> Queues are pretty bad but right now people are in because of Pyramid Head
[2:37:48] <%Ner234> S P E E D
[2:37:52] <Cymen90> @Covil91 lots
[2:37:54] <encrouched> Crack Billy was invented by the CIA
[2:37:55] <%huskarl_zap> #BRINGBACKBILLY
[2:37:55] <+NitronStreams> wheres BECKY tho?
[2:37:56] <+Excelumin> @apolitenoob Mori allows you to directly kill Survivors that you've hooked at least once
[2:37:59] <apolitenoob> oh SHIT
[2:38:02] <%Keyd00d> Drop the crack Billy
[2:38:05] <Captain_Doomsday> Yes, these killers can't kill anyone without a rare offering.
[2:38:08] <%Birdigalore> Don't have to 3 hook people with Mori, just hook once then kill
[2:38:12] <+Kairi__> Heavy chain.
[2:38:12] <+pectusumbra> Put down the Crack Pat
[2:38:13] <@SoFarFetched> Heeyyyy the survivors ALSO got a Billy
[2:38:18] <marvel877> was cooking and eating dinner, what I miss?
[2:38:24] <socratetris> apparently some turkish retailer leaked that all ps2 abs ps3 games will work on ps5... maybe look into this for podcast?
[2:38:27] <%Dementedpenguin> Remember when you could do Moris after the first down? That was.... swell.
[2:38:27] <Captain_Doomsday> And then you depip because you didn't get enough points.
[2:38:34] <fuji_92> that seems busted
[2:38:34] <encrouched> Yo Crack Billy hook a brother up
[2:38:35] <studleydoorite> Memento Mori is a special ability that causes survivors to hit themselves in the face and they die
[2:38:40] <@SSaryn> I don't believe that.
[2:38:42] <%Mendin> Wait the red mori isnt hidden?
[2:38:43] <Captain_Doomsday> They see that you used a HIDDEN offering. They don't know if it's a mori or which
[2:38:44] <andrei11dr> Ah ,i see Pat has to wear clothes again , how disappointing

[2:38:48] <fuji_92> hmmmmmmmmmm
[2:38:49] <j0ustar> I WANT to believe that
[2:38:49] <Animal_Farm4> They just see that you used SOMETHING, but everyone will assume a mori

[2:58:00] <+Kaiserzelcor> She went all super terf for no reason again
[2:58:00] <+BeezusHrist> She's become a meme
[2:58:00] <+JustToWatch> she's Glinnering
[2:58:02] <NoirePanzer> It's Terf O'clock
[2:58:03] <+lethallylactic> lol
[2:58:03] <indig0bird> Why can't she shut up?

[2:58:06] <+samoorai> TERF shit again
[2:58:07] <%DappercatEsquire> Ughhhh
[2:58:08] <rissaleigh14> What
[2:58:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Terf?
[2:58:09] <narusao> suuure you have
[2:58:10] <%InugamiTheHound> did the radical left attack her for not being WOKE enough?
[2:58:14] <+BeezusHrist> JK memeing
[2:58:14] <indig0bird> Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist
[2:58:15] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Stupid TERF biiiiiiiiiiiitch
[2:58:15] <%Mendin> ***
[2:58:17] <+BloodyBurney> she's saying shitty things about trans people
[2:58:19] <%Starotter70> LUL
[2:58:20] <$ragingbrachy> I FUCKING THOUGHT SHE MEANT THE FUCK SEX TOO
[2:58:21] <narusao> LUL
[2:58:25] <narusao> sounds legit
[2:58:26] <%spiritofmojave> IT IS
[2:58:26] <+The_Protagonist> reminder she literally made jew stereotypes a race, and also named the asian girl "Cho Chang" which is like 2 letters away from the racist asian term
[2:58:26] <+SausageShogun> LUL
[2:58:27] <%miguelrod777> true
[2:58:29] <Cymen90> PAT IT IS NOT
[2:58:29] <%MisterRockett> I mean she didn't need to.
[2:58:29] <%Starotter70> OH YEAH
[2:58:29] <%manwithboxonhead> What
[2:58:31] <Dragon_Batman> Ooh so that is what she is doing
[2:58:31] <%Mister_McDerp> they were already ruined though
[2:58:32] <+lethallylactic> What is there to ruin?
[2:58:32] <@SSaryn> Nice
[2:58:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound Pretty much
[2:58:33] <%spiritofmojave> That and her stupid LORE additions
[2:58:35] <%Sir_stride> for those that dont know, TERF is a Trans Exclusion Radical Feminist
[2:58:35] <Cymen90> NOT THIS AGAIN PAT
[2:58:36] <%Spydurman> TERF = Trans-exlusionary-Radical-Feminist aka Feminist against Trans people
[2:58:36] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt She's the Darth Vader of Harry Potter
[2:58:38] <+Skelegroove> Put lid on coffee
[2:58:38] <Animorphimagi> yuuuuup
[2:58:38] <%Klownkommander> Oh absolutely
[2:58:38] <DracaenaLeaf> Hatsune Miku is the author of Harry Potter now!
[2:58:39] <SchroedingersFerret> At least she isn't a TERF
[2:58:40] <sugarveins> True
[2:58:40] <%GummiBunnies> miku now owns the harry potter series
[2:58:40] <rissaleigh14> Hahaha
[2:58:41] <andrei11dr> Some old people shouldn't have Twitter
[2:58:41] <%MisterRockett> She's a mormon so you can kinda just assume.
[2:58:41] <marvel877> I know it stands for 'Kathleen', but I feel like the K in J.K. Rowling should be changed to 'Karen'.
[2:58:42] <%Mekhet09> Yeah but twilight was rock bottom.
[2:58:42] <Ipsenscastle> tainted by all the pooping themselves they were doing
[2:58:44] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt WHY DOES JK ROWLING LOOK LIKE AN OLD PAIGE???
[2:58:45] <indig0bird> Means trans women don't exist but they're wrong and we don't like dem peeps
[2:58:46] <%Binary_Fireball> you know what's NOT tainted? LOTR... the hobbit doesnt count
[2:58:46] <tusk102> For yall not wanting to look up her twitter, this is what she said "If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth."
[2:58:47] <%wjones0415> that because her book sucked from the get go
[2:58:47] <Cymen90> THINGS DO NOT GET TAINTED RETROACTIVELY
[2:58:49] <%Agami23> yeah its just JK saying some stupid terf shit on twitter again.
[2:58:50] <%weissguard> Yeah, but I'd still look at Harry Potter stuff. Twilight is a big yikes that people I've spoken too are sort of ashamed that they knew.
[2:58:52] <%Starotter70> I heard Terfs, I heard the Turks
[2:58:53] <FirearmsInstructor> @Sir_stride thanks
[2:58:59] <$ragingbrachy> @Thewoodentree SHE DOES
[2:59:00] <%Mister_McDerp> wait, Rowling hates trans people?
[2:59:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DappercatEsquire she is the Kathline Kennedy of Harry potter
[2:59:03] <sugarveins> No but Meyer treats indigenous people like shit
[2:59:05] <+The_Protagonist> she might as well be one of the Turks
[2:59:06] <%Overloard> can't ruin it if its already shit
[2:59:09] <%Sir_stride> @firearmsinstructor not a problem
[2:59:09] <%king_wragles> @Mister_McDerp apparently, ya
[2:59:17] <tusk102> @Binary_Fireball that's bc Tolkiens dead so he can't use twitter
[2:59:22] <%Overloard> but at least its consistent
[2:59:23] <$ragingbrachy> you have to shoot him pat
[2:59:25] <marvel877> I don't know, HIMYM got tainted for me because of that last episode.
[2:59:27] <NoirePanzer> Ewww dayvid
[2:59:31] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt thats my name and im doing dabs please stop
[2:59:36] <andrei11dr> Thank God Tolkien is dead and can't tell us that Saruman shits his pants LUL
[2:59:38] <SGrim> @Starotter70 excuse me teacher, what's a terf?
[2:59:41] <$ragingbrachy> you have a bullets and gun
[2:59:41] <indig0bird> @Mister_McDerp We don't have the capacity to read her mind and know for sure but we can make an educated guess because of all the shitty things she has said and the horrid people she has supported
[2:59:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> OR DID YOU
[2:59:48] <%Mister_McDerp> well I guess I hate Rowling now
[2:59:49] <%Binary_Fireball> @tusk102 very true
[2:59:52] <ImmaCanuck> Oh jeez, David please. Stick to the plan let's go let's go
[2:59:54] <TheBraveLittleClaptrap> I would of thought Pat would be playing pyramind head.
[2:59:55] <+pectusumbra> Can't let you do that Dave
[2:59:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tusk102 Tolkien was a huge asshole though he hated alogories
[3:00:01] <Djinnazz> Pat SUX
[3:00:03] <%Kataguro> That Slow Vault
[3:00:03] <%DappercatEsquire> You guys wonder if Jesus shit his pants?
[3:00:04] <$ragingbrachy> ahh!
[3:00:10] <%Kaji04> DAvid BUDDY you hate to see IT
[3:00:12] <Captain_Doomsday> Did Jesus wear pants?
[3:00:17] <%Binary_Fireball> so remind why tolkein was an asshole?
[3:00:18] <@SoFarFetched> Pat can't play Pyramid Head cause he missed out on the testing period,so has to wait for full release.
[3:00:20] <%Klownkommander> @thebravelittleclaptrap he can't since the orb was taken down
[3:00:21] <NoirePanzer> David I thought you were supposed to at a creek of some sort
[3:00:25] <%DappercatEsquire> @Captain_Doomsday touche
[3:00:26] <%Starotter70> Jesus definitely shit his robes, but he cleaned it up with magic
[3:00:27] <dan_g_v> aww yeah grunting
[3:00:28] <deaddogsinrivers> Jesus didn't wear pants, he wore a robe, learn your lore
[3:00:29] <SGrim> @Starotter70 nvm I googled it.
[3:00:33] <%Klownkommander> *ptb
[3:00:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @Sir_stride wait does that mean ... she's not a feminist against trans? Or doesn't consider someone who's t... god damnit shit's complicated and stupid
[3:00:35] <Nomad_Scholar> "STuDEntS DOn"t NEeD TO gO To thE bATHroOM, thEY shIt THEmSeLVES in cLASs"
[3:00:36] <andrei11dr> Nah ,Jesus is divine, he don't need to shit
[3:00:37] <+BeezusHrist> Jk rowling said something about transgender]

[3:00:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 48s.
[3:00:43] <%Valdorick> RIP
[3:00:43] <$Dakuu75> Man, I was up until like 6am watching Kenny and YoVideoGames play Warzone, so I woke up late for Pat's stream
[3:00:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:00:44] <+BeezusHrist> That's all I know
[3:00:47] <SquigglyLizard> LUL
[3:00:50] <hoopray> rip
[3:00:50] <AFlyingTaco1> @patstaresat Hard Drive already made an article about JK
[3:00:51] <FirearmsInstructor> @Sir_stride nevermind it doesn't matter and isn't important, lol thx anyway
[3:00:51] <%Mister_McDerp> got em
[3:00:51] <indig0bird> She has been mithologized a lot but it happens that people who have put effort into the things they've done can be shitty people too
[3:00:53] <Captain_Doomsday> Always just assume they're on voice chat in DbD
[3:00:59] <%StaceMcGate> J.K. Rowling "If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth."
[3:00:59] <TheBraveLittleClaptrap> @Klownkommander orb?
[3:01:00] <%Starotter70> @SGrim Yeah, just googled it a bit ago too
[3:01:08] <dan_g_v> oh yeah, jesus is supposed to be a wizard in HP world, right?
[3:01:11] <%Pappajimbo> @DappercatEsquire if he did the vatican would keep it in a chest. the devine poop
[3:01:12] <%DappercatEsquire> "Truth," right
[3:01:13] <%StaceMcGate> she being transphobic again
[3:01:17] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt i have a friend who plays ds3 ONLY while cindered, to the point that they will farm the knights in front of the dancers boss room for embers or buy them from the store
[3:01:19] <Captain_Doomsday> Survivors are huge scumbag cheaters. And JK is a knob who doesn't know what genders are.
[3:01:20] <koolaid_kevster> I feel like pat and paige love this game cause its ez to foreplay I could see pat creepin saying "swiggity swooty I'm coming for that booty"
[3:01:22] <deaddogsinrivers> Jesus is a Stand user in HP world
[3:01:34] <@SoFarFetched> So then Pat would harpoon Paige's ass? Kappa
[3:01:36] <+AnthraxJohnson> Those grunts lmao
[3:01:44] <Saltmeisterr> god these screams are goofy
[3:01:46] <$Dakuu75> what killer is this?
[3:01:51] <$ragingbrachy> gun man
[3:01:53] <%Starotter70> Harry Potter but instead of Magic, it's just Stands
[3:01:53] <tusk102> @deaddogsinrivers you see, jesus used his stand, three days grace to come back to life
[3:02:00] <FortuneEX> LUL
[3:02:01] <+BeezusHrist> @StaceMcGate Eh, I wouldn't call that transphobic, just a disagreement
[3:02:01] <dan_g_v> aww yeah, wet grunts and squishy
[3:02:02] <%DappercatEsquire> Wait, if they did have some of Jesus's shit preserved, do you think it would've shown up in Jojo?
[3:02:03] <+BKNPham> Really?! on the rocks?!
[3:02:04] <+egalitarian696969> rip that guy
[3:02:04] <%GummiBunnies> LUL
[3:02:08] <+The_Protagonist> man david can't catch a break haha
[3:02:09] <%Mister_McDerp> sucks for him
[3:02:12] <@SSaryn> I think David just really wants to die
[3:02:13] <$ragingbrachy> so much for voice comms
[3:02:15] <+pectusumbra> "What's up? You like the kind of girl that can give me the good long suck." Man, Ken Ashton's great
[3:02:20] <ursusbearrammage> david is having a bad day
[3:02:24] <+BloodyBurney> he seems good on this map
[3:02:26] <$Dakuu75> this looks OP lol
[3:02:26] <apolitenoob> They sacrificed him, for sure
[3:02:27] <$ragingbrachy> monkaS
[3:02:29] <%Klownkommander> wow he's being farmed by his buddies so badly
[3:02:31] <tusk102> STAND USER: Jesus of Nazareth STAND: [THREE DAYS GRACE]
[3:02:35] <%Kaji04> C'mon davey, you know better than to be bad at videogames
[3:02:38] <%YakumoYomi> @deaddogsinrivers I could see that. Shaman King essentially says that a lot of prominent spiritual leaders throughout history (including Jesus) were previous Shaman Kings.
[3:02:38] <NoirePanzer> The audacity of these gamers
[3:02:43] <%BubbaRands> I appreciate David's Drip tho
[3:02:43] <legacy0117> Awesome you feel them in like a damn fish!!
[3:02:44] <+The_Protagonist> ?? wait why did Pat just ignore her
[3:02:44] <%king_wragles> So why not the girl?
[3:02:50] <legacy0117> reel*
[3:02:57] <%king_wragles> @The_Protagonist I think it's a buff thing she has, but I don't know for sure
[3:02:58] <Morbidmort> @tusk102 Actually, it was [LOVE TRAIN]
[3:03:00] <%StaceMcGate> @BeezusHrist I wouldn't call it transphobic without her having a history of debating the existence of trans identity. Because its a recurring issue I called it that
[3:03:05] <deaddogsinrivers> You could see it??? It's straight up canon dude
[3:03:06] <%BubbaRands> Dude's got style for a dead man
[3:03:13] <%Kataguro> Especially against living things
[3:03:14] <%DappercatEsquire> especially against living etc
[3:03:15] <%InugamiTheHound> can't shoot gun?
[3:03:20] <+theKingRamses> aren't you able to shoot her and ignore that penalty
[3:03:27] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I think Pat has Obsession on
[3:03:33] <%PlagueOfGripes> the survivors sure can shake off a hook through their ribcage and organs like a champion
[3:03:35] <tusk102> @Morbidmort no no that's what three days grace became after he used it to come back to life three days after the devil killed him with his stand, [DOWN TO GEORGIA]
[3:03:43] <$ragingbrachy> heh 4Head
[3:03:45] <dinnydanny777> Isn't Jesus's stand really just having the ability to befriend prostitutes
[3:03:46] <@SSaryn> OK
[3:03:48] <%Buzzard42> ????
[3:03:48] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes Plot Armor can only last so long.

[3:04:32] <%king_wragles> They are 100% lagging away from you
[3:04:34] <legacy0117> She vanished. For real.
[3:04:38] <deaddogsinrivers> Isn't this whole genre based on a Gmod?
[3:04:39] <%Starotter70> Only Redbars can defeat The Horrors
[3:04:42] <%DappercatEsquire> What is this, Halo 2?
[3:04:42] <$ragingbrachy> its a valid strat
[3:04:46] <Fep3> wtf, you got a gun?

[3:04:54] <$Dakuu75> can't believe lag-switching is still a thing 2020
[3:04:56] <Covil91> Tactical lag spike
[3:04:57] <%Klownkommander> I literally saw that earlier today when I was playing
[3:04:59] <legacy0117> This killer does.
[3:05:06] <EuropanLamprey> Lag switching is still a thing?
[3:05:06] <dinnydanny777> There's nothing better than beating people who lag switch
[3:05:07] <%Klownkommander> just up and bamf
[3:05:07] <+Excelumin> Yeah this killer's power is GUN
[3:05:13] <Decarcassor> Its just the dedicated servers being fucky. No cheating involved.
[3:05:14] <+BeezusHrist> @StaceMcGate Well the abolition of sex in a biological sense is a direct assault on people who feel sex IS an important aspect of their own identity. Getting rid of Gender as a social concept is fine, but trying to say there is no biological differences between men and women is a huge leap especially considering we as apes are quite sexually dimorphic
[3:05:15] <+Blargimazombie> Gun go up
[3:05:16] <+Excelumin> american magic
[3:05:18] <FirearmsInstructor> What's lag switching? (I can kinda guess but how does it work?)
[3:05:19] <j0ustar> Lag > Gun
[3:05:19] <dinnydanny777> If you beat people who lag switch it's like "yeah you suck"
[3:05:27] <legacy0117> It is a Harpoon gun though, so it is lot more fair.
[3:05:27] <%Starotter70> Gotta go now, have fun with the DBD guys! KonCha
[3:05:27] <+SlightlySychotic> Not lag switching. WI-FI
[3:05:29] <+The_Protagonist> is the killer's gun called "Big Chungus"?
[3:05:37] <+Jasek7> dbd for evo
[3:05:37] <TheBraveLittleClaptrap> What is Lag Switch? never heard the term.

[3:06:39] <FirearmsInstructor> PatHatesAt
[3:06:44] <%DappercatEsquire> Girls that wear chokers LOVE lag switching
[3:06:55] <%Laecerelius> Only Pat is allowed to cheat!
[3:06:56] <viewtifulr> also break ankles
[3:06:58] <Fep3> or, since he said they're lag switching, it stopped working

[3:07:10] <dan_g_v> is there a compilation of the amazing voice acting of this game?
[3:07:13] <rissaleigh14> Basement time
[3:07:14] <EuropanLamprey> @FirearmsInstructor Used to be a switch attached to your internet cable that you can hit to stop your internet and people used it to King Crimson in FPS games back in the 90s-2000s
[3:07:14] <j0ustar> Only trust your fists Lag will never save you
[3:07:15] <GarettLefebvre> It's like he was waiting for you to play FF7 again.
[3:07:17] <Stofil42> ca't believe they added pudge to this game
[3:07:23] <+BloodyBurney> shootman is so proud of himself after getting his shot, its great
[3:07:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> It's very greasy .

[3:07:36] <%Typhaeon> Diet Pudge
[3:07:42] <SGrim> Girls that wear chokers want you to snap them. SeemsGood
[3:07:45] <corepercentlives> pat could be a character in this game with very minor additions
[3:07:57] <Morbidmort> @SGrim Bruh
[3:07:57] <+pectusumbra> Redcap Pat would be fantastic
[3:07:58] <Stofil42> is pyramid head in the game yet?
[3:08:00] <%InugamiTheHound> is "the spoony one" down there?
[3:08:01] <%KishinGrek> KishinGrek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! what's up , favorite Canadian shitposterthanks for the years of entertainment, wanted to give something back bromuch love to Elmo and Paige
[3:08:02] <dinnydanny777> So do chokers actually choke
[3:08:09] <dinnydanny777> Or is it just a name
[3:08:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:08:12] <Decarcassor> @dan_g_v Killers don't have any dialogue, and survivors are moslty just grunt of pain.

[3:08:27] <FirearmsInstructor> @EuropanLamprey thanks. So basically the packets all surged and caught up and rapid fire hit?

[3:08:41] <thwak> time to find the hatch
[3:08:42] <$ragingbrachy> entity summoned monkaS
[3:08:42] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat, you say that, but I haven't played this game yet
[3:08:45] <%king_wragles> It's almost like they cheated the game, and themselves
[3:08:54] <%Tearonex> You'll never reach the truth with Ping Crimson
[3:09:01] <HarraceHarrison> That "people shift when they hit the ground" thing is an issue, I don't think they're intentionally causing it
[3:09:02] <legacy0117> Oh wow two in the basement? Stay there!
[3:09:05] <+goryloles> Why would people use a lag switch in this game? Is there a ranked mode or something?
[3:09:08] <+theKingRamses> probably hiding in a locker somewhere
[3:09:11] <EmpyreanMAULER> Feng is either gonna save or look for hatch
[3:09:13] <legacy0117> Silly Pat.
[3:09:13] <%Kataguro> Probaly just crouching on the hatch
[3:09:18] <EuropanLamprey> @FirearmsInstructor Sort of. You know how people with bad internet teleport around? Lag Switching is just that but timed and intentional.
[3:09:20] <EmpyreanMAULER> they 3 genned themselves
[3:09:23] <$Dakuu75> "smart but pathetic" lol
[3:09:23] <%DappercatEsquire> Smart but pathetic is the winning strategy for all horror movies
[3:09:26] <rissaleigh14> Everything is ranked in this game
[3:09:28] <%king_wragles> Wouldn't you do the same thing if you liked playing survivor?
[3:09:28] <%Klownkommander> @goryloles game is permanently in ranked mode
[3:09:36] <FirearmsInstructor> @EuropanLamprey so rubber banding, basically?
[3:09:41] <dinnydanny777> The winning strategy to a horror movie is never having had sex
[3:09:44] <@SSaryn> waow
[3:09:44] <%Kataguro> What a hero

[3:11:01] <FirearmsInstructor> What's "Exposed"? LUL
[3:11:04] <%fobitbswo> fobitbswo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:11:04] <studleydoorite> @Mekhet09 when a killer gets close enough to hit, I'm sure it helps survivors juke easier
[3:11:07] <%Kataguro> Exposed means you go down in 1 hit
[3:11:09] <rissaleigh14> Down in one hit
[3:11:18] <HarraceHarrison> The max range on it is like 18 meters so it's a tricky distance to hit
[3:11:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @Kataguro ty :)
[3:11:31] <EuropanLamprey> @FirearmsInstructor King Crimson is a stand that can Skip Time, causing everything to teleport around. It gets referenced any time something "skips" due to lag
[3:11:41] <$og_reesetti> Cheer1000 Hearing the section of the podcast about this encouraged me to get it. I got to watch Paige to learn a bit about survivor so now you can teach me about Killer. Hope you're having a good one and both of you are staying safe.

[3:15:42] <rissaleigh14> Maybe they are not in their right mind in the first place
[3:15:43] <Captain_Doomsday> Ironically, Obsession perks tend to mean "Don't attack the Obsession"

[3:15:55] <%Aydarkzero> bonk
[3:16:02] <MarkUriah> Do the different survivors have unique abilities?
[3:16:06] <%Aydarkzero> so melee first then gun
[3:16:10] <SGrim> Since we're obviously talking about JK, what did she mean by sex not existing? Is that a comment on transitioning?
[3:16:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> YOU DID EFFED
[3:16:16] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Roasted_Pheasant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 1 month streak! If red orb is Rorb and purple orb is Porb, and you are also an orb, does this question PATORB you?
[3:16:17] <Dragon_Batman> Doesn't the shoot have a bleed effect?
[3:16:27] <Captain_Doomsday> JK Rowling doesn't know the difference between sex and gender.
[3:16:38] <legacy0117> Harpoon Gun stops griefs sitting on the second floor taunting you.
[3:16:46] <legacy0117> from*
[3:16:49] <Captain_Doomsday> Survivors are IDENTICAL except in sound and look, but each has 3 "Teachable" perks they start with.
[3:16:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dumbledore was a glazed donut by JK twitter
[3:16:51] <$Dakuu75> so, some survivors can buff others, with their perks?
[3:16:56] <HarraceHarrison> Sprint burst baybee, always safe
[3:16:58] <SGrim> @Captain_Doomsday that would make sense. And also be fittingly stupid, so I'll take your word for it!
[3:16:59] <rissaleigh14> Yeah she called it sex throughout the whole tweet which really confused me at first
[3:17:02] <FirearmsInstructor> Why is he ON FIRE??
[3:17:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dumbledore beard was always covered in man juice
[3:17:05] <Covil91> Of course there's a hospital level. Hospitals are creepy
[3:17:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @Captain_Doomsday JK Rowling never read up on John Money.
[3:17:15] <Katorskay> From state farm?
[3:17:16] <+BeezusHrist> @SGrim Some activists are pushing the notion that there is no dfference between biologicval sex between males and females. It works with gender because gender is a social construct; it does not work with a biological fact like sex
[3:17:17] <Dragon_Batman> That would have been funny

[3:18:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> My favourite Dead By Daylight killer, SnapShotKing
[3:18:04] <%Roasted_Pheasant> If his gun is actually a harpoon, why is he a cowboy and not a sailor?
[3:18:04] <dan_g_v> pat's mlg training is paying off
[3:18:16] <SGrim> @BeezusHrist internal medicine would have a field day if biology was entirely consistent between the sexes. We'd have panacea's in a year tops.
[3:18:19] <AFlyingTaco1> @clundy What the fuck? Do they like stabbing themselves?
[3:18:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Because he was hunting Graboids
[3:18:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> see
[3:18:31] <Dragon_Batman> Cowboys are kooler probably
[3:18:32] <Ipsenscastle> @Clundy if nothing's breaking or injuring you, you're not doing it wrong

[3:19:02] <rissaleigh14> Oof
[3:19:04] <+MessyBristles> @Roasted_Pheasant thengun is meant to shoot railroad spikes
[3:19:05] <%Mister_McDerp> you miss every shot you don't take
[3:19:08] <legacy0117> At least it isn't as brutal of a killer as that monster from Stranger things. It just eats people sometimes.
[3:19:11] <Thewoodentree> Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Societaly Enforced Heteronormativity
[3:19:23] <lilferniee> hyaaaah
[3:19:24] <%Clundy> @aflyingtaco1 probably @ipsenscastle good point
[3:19:28] <Fanciful_Unicorn> there are a lot of damn chase blockers in here
[3:19:28] <FirearmsInstructor> Apparently Pat misses every shot he does take, too. womp womp
[3:19:30] <+ararebeast> They got some gens done really fast, did they bring spare parts?
[3:19:33] <%Roasted_Pheasant> But it's a railway spike on a chain. So it's a harpoon
[3:19:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Harry Potter and the Order of the Glazed Donut kappaPride

[3:20:34] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> What's BBQ and Chilli?
[3:20:39] <SGrim> @BeezusHrist medically speaking? I would assume that to be the case.
[3:20:44] <+anthonywilde1994> what map is this ?
[3:20:55] <+ultimafullmetal> It's amazing how many hooks in the back these people live through
[3:20:58] <+mikesapartment> theres way too many palettes here
[3:21:08] <$ragingbrachy> man. there sure are alot of wooden palates here
[3:21:11] <Captain_Doomsday> The bloodweb system is terrible. IT's pure RNG with a lot of grinding for income
[3:21:11] <+theKingRamses> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense a perk from leatherface that lets you see survivors auras for a limited time after hooking someone
[3:21:14] <%Treuan> Nice hit
[3:21:16] <+AnthraxJohnson> Pat can you try ghostface after?
[3:21:19] <+ararebeast> @Treuan You have to get the killer who owns it up to a certain level, then it randomly appears in trees for every other killer
[3:21:21] <BrachyZoid> You can get it if you level up the respective killer for its perk enough
[3:21:22] <Decarcassor> @anthonywilde1994 Léry Memorial Institute. The Doctor's map.
[3:21:22] <%ChaosAethr> You poor Foo
[3:21:27] <%ChaosAethr> l
[3:21:32] <%Mekhet09> There's no way to unhook yourself right?
[3:21:33] <+InEzrealwetrust> hey pat finally got his gun
[3:21:33] <FirearmsInstructor> AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[3:21:34] <redial_nick> what is the level cap here?
[3:21:34] <ImmaCanuck> AHHHHHHhhhh
[3:21:36] <%DappercatEsquire> If I left this many pallets around when I worked at a hardware store, I'd be fuckin done
[3:21:38] <%Mister_McDerp> jermaChomp AAAA
[3:21:39] <$Dakuu75> that screeam didn't sound like pain, lol
[3:21:40] <Dragon_Batman> That man sounded like he was trying to sing
[3:21:41] <$ragingbrachy> AAAAAAhhhhhh....
[3:21:41] <tiaramaki> aaaaaaaaaaaaa
[3:21:42] <lilferniee> HAAAAAaaaaaaaah
[3:21:42] <suitangi021> Do you think they'll leave leather face as the worst killer BECAUSE he gives the best perk?
[3:21:42] <+Vegaburd> they gave steve the worst scream
[3:21:43] <figleafplays> there is so much going on right now
[3:21:43] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> @theKingRamses Oh wow, that sounds vital for a killer to have
[3:21:44] <+vampireinarm> WTF was that scream LUL
[3:21:44] <%TheActuallyGuy> Lery Memorial is the worst map
[3:21:45] <%Buzzard42> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[3:21:49] <tetriata> Does Pat not have the perk on the bloodweb yet, or does he not have the perk at all?
[3:21:53] <%Clundy> Splorch
[3:21:54] <+ararebeast> @redial_nick 50 but you can keep leveling afterwards
[3:21:54] <+Jasek7> efforts in this game are silly
[3:21:55] <Captain_Doomsday> There isn't a real level cap. YOu can keep levelling for more perks, but you can prestige at 50
[3:21:56] <legacy0117> Two is good for that fast of caps.
[3:21:57] <%Aydarkzero> Kappa

[3:24:11] <%bevyrage> pat why would they try to get the buddy if you keep camping it
[3:24:14] <MarkUriah> Their compassion towards each other is killing them

[3:25:07] <Dragon_Batman> Good shot tho
[3:25:07] <%Mister_McDerp> damn
[3:25:10] <Decarcassor> @PatStaresAt If you stay withing 16 meters of the hook while no survivors are around you lose point toward one of your emblems. I think its the Malicious one.

[3:25:15] <+heretostream> LUL
[3:25:16] <+worldbrand> damn
[3:25:17] <HarraceHarrison> You actually could've used the addon there
[3:25:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:25:22] <%Mekhet09> That's bullshit they need to fix that.
[3:25:23] <%bevyrage> gonna admit, i like this dude and his harpoon
[3:25:23] <legacy0117> SICK
[3:25:30] <legacy0117> WHAT?
[3:25:30] <TalekAetem> Is that Caleb from Blood?
[3:25:37] <rissaleigh14> Harpoon is sick
[3:25:39] <%Mekhet09> The fact that you can body block the harpoon is unfair.
[3:25:40] <DSD24> @TalekAetem He looks like Caleb
[3:25:47] <legacy0117> They can break your harpoon pull?
[3:25:47] <%BoneofMalkav> Sadly not Caleb
[3:25:47] <+BeezusHrist> Beezus Hrist
[3:25:48] <$Dakuu75> looks like a shitty sphere grid
[3:25:49] <+AnthraxJohnson> Can you try a different killer?
[3:25:50] <Captain_Doomsday> I sure hate it.
[3:25:55] <%Pilzkun> what's wrong with it?
[3:25:58] <BlacSoul> cant you hit from harpoon?
[3:25:59] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, try a Stalky Boi
[3:26:00] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Is there anything that lets you hit two people at once?
[3:26:00] <+ararebeast> Ohhh. The Entity is displeased because you're only hooking the same people and not hooking everyone
[3:26:01] <legacy0117> That sucksss
[3:26:02] <BettyMwwaahh> that looked really dumb that they can stand inbetween the harpoon and the survivor?
[3:26:04] <Decarcassor> @Mekhet09 Its designed to work that way.
[3:26:12] <%BoneofMalkav> Caleb would probably be a good killer for DBD though
[3:26:12] <suitangi021> @PatStaresAt Do you think Leather face will stay the worst since he gives BBQ and Chili?
[3:26:26] <tetriata> @PatStaresAt Who's your favorite killer?
[3:26:44] <wyrdboy21121> do you play survivor sometimes?
[3:26:45] <legacy0117> Terrible killer for killing groups, great for 1 vs 1.
[3:26:47] <+Struggleful> BBQ and Chili's? Kreygasm
[3:27:02] <maxpasta> What’s a bloodweb
[3:27:06] <Captain_Doomsday> There are also a ton of garbage perks they should just remove or merge.
[3:27:10] <Dragon_Batman> So your just cycling through a list of trash to get the good list?
[3:27:10] <%Pilzkun> hhhuhhh
[3:27:13] <%chambatron> and so torth
[3:27:15] <rissaleigh14> Bloodweb is the levelling system
[3:27:19] <%Pilzkun> that's interesting thanks Pat
[3:27:20] <%ChaosAethr> Thats sound terrible
[3:27:22] <+MillerLowlife> internet for vampires

[3:27:59] <Thewoodentree> Can you hit two people at once with anyone?
[3:27:59] <Captain_Doomsday> You have to BUY the Killers you wan tperks for, though, and many pay perks are meta.
[3:28:01] <%BoneofMalkav> @MillerLowlife Nah, only Malkavians have that, and that's called the Malkavian Network LUL
[3:28:02] <Dragon_Batman> And Yup @Dakuu75

[3:28:48] <$ragingbrachy> 🤡 👍
[3:28:55] <Ujean917> OHTofu is a pretty great streamer to look up for all around general info for this game
[3:28:55] <@SoFarFetched> @Dragon_Batman Probably because it's been so long since SH3 came out,that might as well use real name.
[3:29:05] <andrei11dr> At least he tried more than Woolie "meet your Makyr"
[3:29:12] <tusk102> wowie
[3:29:22] <NoirePanzer> Pog 4.X patch notes?! Any new primals

[3:29:35] <Captain_Doomsday> @theKingRamses You can, but the shrine is weekly, random, and includes garbage base game perks. It also uses Shards, which you need to unlock OCs without paying..
[3:29:36] <+blacktomcruise2> Page is with pat still wow
[3:29:38] <rissaleigh14> Welp
[3:29:39] <Dragon_Batman> @SoFarFetched I guess that's fair, tho I'm always a stickler for there is always time for people to have not known
[3:29:47] <+BeezusHrist> LUL
[3:29:48] <rissaleigh14> Nice idea though
[3:29:49] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Konami isn't really doing much with the Silent Hill seriese these days.

[3:31:15] <lucastheludius> Nah trapper is a winner

[3:33:02] <%KnivesEve> what killer is pat using? never seen one with a gun
[3:33:05] <Captain_Doomsday> You'll PROTECT these people if you tilt them off the game.
[3:33:06] <maxpasta> Cull the herd
[3:33:07] <+superkeaton> They can't be new blood until they're bled
[3:33:08] <+Excelumin> Deathslinger
[3:33:11] <og_reesetti> Man I'm glad I didn't get Pat for my first match lol
[3:33:13] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to BunnyEmperor! They have given 245 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[3:33:17] <+Struggleful> "Man that's broken" - New Scrubs
[3:33:27] <%bevyrage> that hit seemed sus
[3:33:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Be as toxic as possible vs. noobs so they don't get investment fallacy by red ranks
[3:33:31] <Dragon_Batman> She doesn't know the map it seems
[3:33:44] <Thewoodentree> Like a deer in front of a convoy
[3:33:52] <%bevyrage> doesn't paige main killers
[3:33:54] <%CalderGaming> i get that the "wiping the blood off the gun" thing is meant to balance the melee attack rate, but is there a lore reason for it too?
[3:33:54] <%Buzzard42> why does the killer always pick up survivors by the asshole
[3:33:55] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Sounds like Peach "Johns" Saliva to me
[3:33:57] <rissaleigh14> I wanna see these guys ranks
[3:33:57] <Meekest> Pat that's wrong
[3:34:02] <Captain_Doomsday> To be fair, Clown is pretty dumb and bad.
[3:34:02] <+worldbrand> no that is ironic
[3:34:05] <$ragingbrachy> lole
[3:34:07] <mark_collins45> what do you mean...community
[3:34:11] <%Kataguro> He's right
[3:34:21] <+SlightlySychotic> Last game was against rockstars. This game is against potatoes. Equivalent exchange.
[3:34:22] <andrei11dr> Pat ,you are a dank meme
[3:34:23] <tetriata> Survivor favoritism has died down a fair bit. It used to be so disgustingly one sided
[3:34:23] <%BunnyEmperor> pat may be the killer, but paige survives him
[3:34:24] <ammobasket> He's pat

[3:36:24] <%bevyrage> so close
[3:36:28] <Thewoodentree> This is what it must feel like to be an actual killer against a bunch of stupid teenagers
[3:36:45] <Decarcassor> This meg seem to know the basics of looping at least.

[3:37:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> Paaaaaige
[3:37:46] <Captain_Doomsday> Survivor mains were ecstatic that Killers have a winrate over 50% (across all platforms), but ignored that the game snowballs massively after a single kill.
[3:37:46] <%CalderGaming> i get that the "wiping the blood off the gun" thing is meant to balance the melee attack rate, but is there a lore reason for it too?
[3:37:49] <j0ustar> Pat used: GET OVER HERE!
[3:37:50] <%LordSDB> BASEMENT TIME
[3:37:50] <andrei11dr> @thewoodentree I don't know, teenagers know Jiu Jistu and shit now at day's, it probably pretty hard

[3:38:04] <%tumzfestival> sry if im late chat
[3:38:04] <%TrafficCohen> @CalderGaming Killers like to gloat
[3:38:06] <+CounterBeard> polish it reel good
[3:38:08] <%Mister_McDerp> the killers have OCD obviously
[3:38:08] <%Buzzard42> f
[3:38:11] <Dragon_Batman> They want to keep their tools intact
[3:38:13] <%walternatorz> you need to be sanitary
[3:38:13] <%CalderGaming> fari enough
[3:38:13] <%BubbaRands> It's just cool that way
[3:38:15] <%D00msDayDan> gotta style on them
[3:38:15] <Captain_Doomsday> Ghostface's wipe is from the Scream movies, at least.
[3:38:16] <%Kaji04> What the point of murder if you ain't gonna be stylish about it
[3:38:19] <%Aydarkzero> it gives it some personality
[3:38:19] <mark_collins45> blood clogs p your gun
[3:38:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> If ya dont polish your tools they start to rust and don't cut as good
[3:38:25] <+Target616> Itd be rude to get someone elses blood on someone your killing
[3:38:25] <rissaleigh14> It’s gotta look good you know
[3:38:26] <+superkeaton> All Killerd are weebs, gotta clean the blood off their Katanas
[3:38:30] <mar_krow> killers r weird they like clean murder tools
[3:38:33] <Decarcassor> @Captain_Doomsday There is no such thing as win rates. Only KIll rates, wich don't accuratly reflect the emblem system.
[3:38:35] <armchairmaster_> I think a better animation would be if they kiss their weapons
[3:38:59] <%miguelrod777> swigtty swooty
[3:39:04] <%bevyrage> @armchairmaster_ leave a lipstick print on the side too
[3:39:08] <andrei11dr> heee
[3:39:13] <Dragon_Batman> I think that would look weird in a pov
[3:39:16] <%tumzfestival> The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset.
[3:39:19] <Captain_Doomsday> @Decarcassor Oh, right. Which is even weirder to focus on when their scoring system will depip someone who cleans house too fast.
[3:39:20] <maxpasta> Look at her go
[3:39:21] <Thewoodentree> Does the killer have any way to taunt the other players?
[3:39:23] <GyroBrando> Wow just wiping them out
[3:39:24] <%Fooguwu> the crying only entices the killer more :)
[3:39:31] <%bevyrage> oh man the footsies
[3:39:35] <Decarcassor> @Captain_Doomsday Exactly.
[3:39:43] <+ararebeast> Did he bring Self Care and a flashlight?
[3:39:44] <HarraceHarrison> They fixed that building so much
[3:39:56] <TalekAetem> He even chuckles like Caleb
[3:39:57] <Captain_Doomsday> @Thewoodentree Ghostface can teabag back, nobody else can taunt except Wraith's bingbong.
[3:40:05] <%BubbaRands> Dwight You Ignorant Slut!
[3:40:11] <%Mister_McDerp> no one can defeat GUN
[3:40:15] <Decarcassor> @Captain_Doomsday Not mention, survivor suicides and DC massively affecting the kill rate stats.
[3:40:16] <pandainvazn> Hi @PatStaresAt how's everything going good sir? :D
[3:40:17] <+superkeaton> He's not all Dwight
[3:40:26] <%tumzfestival> NO MERCY
[3:40:28] <dinnydanny777> The most absurd thing about American horror movies is that no one is ever carrying a gun
[3:40:29] <+Estuko> FeelsBirthdayMan I turn 25 tomorrow, this year felt like the longest
[3:40:32] <j0ustar> Big Moidorer
[3:40:33] <Captain_Doomsday> @Decarcassor ALLEGEDLY, they discarded DCs, but suicides would've stuck.
[3:40:34] <%kewlmyc> THAT STRUT
[3:40:35] <%bevyrage> i just realized in this stride animation, the killer is moving twice as fast as his gait allows
[3:40:35] <andrei11dr> The gun is stronk indeed
[3:40:37] <Dragon_Batman> He's got the Dwight stuff
[3:40:37] <%tumzfestival> YO

[3:57:18] <Thewoodentree> Bill wishing he was back in 'Nam right about now
[3:57:24] <+Tunamanguy> @Fep3 survivor and killer are just different skillsets
[3:57:27] <rissaleigh14> And that’s coming from a bad survivor

[3:58:40] <Captain_Doomsday> God, I hope not. Survivor's depressingly boring.
[3:58:41] <Decarcassor> Its hilarious seeing everybody just hold forward and drop pallets near immediatly. Boy is it different in red ranks.

[3:58:50] <tusk102> AHAHAHHAAA

[3:59:52] <Dragon_Batman> Yep
[3:59:53] <rissaleigh14> Hatch
[3:59:57] <%Aydarkzero> yes Bill died in l4d2
[3:59:58] <%fizuth> @Thewoodentree yeps
[4:00:00] <%Treuan> @Thewoodentree This is where he went after
[4:00:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:00:01] <%CalderGaming> that's ROUGH
[4:00:02] <%DappercatEsquire> they did him dirty
[4:00:03] <%spiritofmojave> He got isekai's
[4:00:03] <%Mister_McDerp> bill is in hell
[4:00:06] <Captain_Doomsday> Yeah, but the Entity running DbD is omnipotent because bad writing
[4:00:08] <Sogeki_Dan> Clown!
[4:00:10] <+tigerfang86> Bill Got Isekai'd
[4:00:10] <Thewoodentree> He didnt deserve this....
[4:00:11] <%miguelrod777> life hates him
[4:00:15] <%Ynkubus18> Bill was also in Payday 1
[4:00:16] <+AnthraxJohnson> Ghost face!
[4:00:16] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt BILL IS IN AN ISEKAI?
[4:00:16] <+AXL808> all the survivors are actually dead i think
[4:00:16] <%bevyrage> i can't believe DBD is an isekai
[4:00:17] <GarettLefebvre> Demigorgon?
[4:00:19] <+GenesisKnight> Not all of the survivors are dead but some are I guess?
[4:00:27] <penitentpentwitch> Is it known if Pyramid Head's unique capture mechanic triggers BBQ & Chili yet?
[4:00:28] <%Aydarkzero> @tigerfang86 that's pretty cool
[4:00:28] <%Fooguwu> he came here and his voice changed
[4:00:28] <Mr_Rakjo> RIP
[4:00:29] <+TheEighthNobody> @PatStaresAt you should moonwalk more at loops, you could have gotten Meg at Shack
[4:00:29] <rissaleigh14> Usually survivors are either dead or gone missing
[4:00:30] <%Mister_McDerp> I would read a Bill isekai
[4:00:31] <%BoneofMalkav> Bill now owns Big Bill Hell's Cars
[4:00:33] <%Emperor_Machinus> iut of the frying pan into the fire
[4:00:35] <+BloodyBurney> imagining the oni dashing at you at full speed seems honestly terrifying
[4:00:36] <%Tearonex> The Walking Dead helicopter picked him up so he could be in video games
[4:00:39] <+worldbrand> i mean tbf i cant imagine assembling all of these characters into dbd in a way that isnt stupid
[4:00:40] <MrCyan> How does this work? It looks like when you use all your points it just rerolls and that sounds terrible
[4:00:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> neeed BLUD
[4:00:51] <tusk102> walking backward dingo
[4:00:51] <rissaleigh14> Pretty much
[4:00:52] <armchairmaster_> Bamboozle LUL
[4:00:52] <Decarcassor> @penitentpentwitch It doesn't. Thats the whole point of his cages.
[4:00:57] <+theKingRamses> @Thewoodentree the cinematic this game made for bill is him waking up right after the l4d2 event
[4:00:59] <penitentpentwitch> Fair enough
[4:00:59] <+tigerfang86> Y E P
[4:01:03] <$Quiet__Viking> it hides your red light from survs
[4:01:10] <Dragon_Batman> LUL oooh
[4:01:11] <MrCyan> Fair enough
[4:01:13] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @PatStaresAt you can mindgame your red glow by moonwalking
[4:01:16] <+TheEighthNobody> @PatStaresAt if you walk backwards when you break line of sight, they can't see your red light
[4:01:18] <%jobbedbone> :)
[4:01:21] <+feMC_is_best_girl> chimona
[4:01:21] <tetriata> @PatStaresAt Moonwalking hides the bright red light that's always in front of you
[4:01:24] <+Tunamanguy> playing deathslinger LUL
[4:01:26] <$Quiet__Viking> it's good for simple mind games
[4:01:27] <og_reesetti> smile yep
[4:01:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Fun fact: Nobody wants half of the offerings and perks in the web. The system forces them to waste BP on them.
[4:01:32] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Check out the JK Rowling roastfest on twitter
[4:01:33] <Dragon_Batman> Alrighty , Gotta head out, have a good one everybody
[4:01:36] <GarettLefebvre> What is the max level cap for killers?
[4:01:50] <Ujean917> 50
[4:01:51] <Captain_Doomsday> 50, but you can keep getting stuff off the bloodweb.
[4:01:58] <%Aydarkzero> Not now j.K
[4:01:59] <+Rekinsinn> No cube?
[4:02:03] <%TheFramedWarlock> What did J.K Rowling do now ?
[4:02:06] <+PenmanLupine> Have you seen the Stone Cold Steve Austin stuff on twitter? Dude owning racist shit heads
[4:02:07] <+not_draven> theres no way she isnt doing it on purpose
[4:02:08] <+tigerfang86> like REGULAR WORDS
[4:02:10] <+tigerfang86> but BITCHY
[4:02:10] <%corgispudmen> you should watch Brickys DeadbyDaylight case files
[4:02:11] <Decarcassor> Level does not really mean much in this game.
[4:02:14] <Captain_Doomsday> JK Rowling doesn't know the difference between sex and gender.
[4:02:14] <%Aydarkzero> is Paige on the case?
[4:02:18] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> FUCK TERFS
[4:02:18] <Jodoxk1> Can we just put her back in the alley they found her in? stripThink
[4:02:19] <GarettLefebvre> 50? but Pat's character is 51
[4:02:23] <indig0bird> I can't believe Hatsune Miku wrote Harry Potter!
[4:02:24] <%MagicBeanBurrito> she's using this time to attack trans ppl
[4:02:25] <tetriata> What information we didn't need to know did she grace us with this time?
[4:02:25] <MarkUriah> People are still roasting her? In the middle of Current Events?
[4:02:26] <+tigerfang86> TERFS rooKek
[4:02:27] <+joshujoestar> waaat, since when has pat played DBD?? Pog
[4:02:29] <%Treuan> @TheFramedWarlock Decided now was a great time to go after Trans rights
[4:02:30] <rissaleigh14> She’s transphobic and blamed all the hate on her being a woman
[4:02:30] <Phrickshun> According to google 31 minutes ago JK Rowling said simething anti-trans?
[4:02:37] <%Roasted_Pheasant> OOOOOOOOOH BOY
[4:02:38] <%Keyd00d> turf
[4:02:39] <Captain_Doomsday> Pat's account is level 51. That goes to 100 and resets, giving nothing
[4:02:39] <+dmtjinni> Trusty Pat
[4:02:41] <%DappercatEsquire> @MarkUriah She threw herself into the firing line
[4:02:42] <@SoFarFetched> Well she's being mentioned now because of her recent tweet.
[4:02:43] <T_Sasquatch> @captain_doomsday alot of people don't
[4:02:45] <Thewoodentree> WHAT IS TERF and why is it a thing
[4:02:47] <%Roasted_Pheasant> We in TERF Land now?
[4:02:49] <rissaleigh14> I hope people broke the news to her
[4:02:50] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> everyone is welcome in pats house of crust
[4:03:01] <%TheFramedWarlock> @thewoodentree Trans exclusionary radical feminist
[4:03:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> posted a think saying you're only a woman if you fire blood out your lady dick.
[4:03:03] <%Pilzkun> @Thewoodentree trans exclusive radical feminist
[4:03:06] <%Aydarkzero> lmao
[4:03:11] <%Pilzkun> exclusionary*
[4:03:12] <+Pendragwn> @Captain_Doomsday next to no one does
[4:03:12] <@SoFarFetched> these people look familiar
[4:03:14] <Jodoxk1> Are we gonna get a Paige vs Pat DBD stream at some point?
[4:03:14] <%xxshadowxx416> she threw herself into fire line agien
[4:03:16] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @Thewoodentree a transphobe who hides behind claims of feminism but just spends all their time online attacking trans people
[4:03:17] <+theKingRamses> that meowkitty person was in a game before
[4:03:17] <@SoFarFetched> Cause that Adam F rancis is dressed the same too
[4:03:17] <HarraceHarrison> That looks like the same Adam
[4:03:18] <figleafplays> is it jake from state farm?
[4:03:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @Thewoodentree Basically big pieces of shit that think trans people aren't the gender they are
[4:03:25] <$connos_procrastination> Mabye she saw the riots and remembered she hates oppressed people
[4:03:25] <@SoFarFetched> and Kate looks the same
[4:03:26] <+joshujoestar> You grinding for BP for Pyramid Head pat?
[4:03:26] <%Mister_McDerp> the only people playing this game
[4:03:31] <+Struggleful> Holyknight wants the RUNBACK
[4:03:36] <%spiritofmojave> No one plays this game now D:
[4:03:43] <%spiritofmojave> just 3 people
[4:03:45] <+Estuko> I want PyramidHead to snap my spin with his dick
[4:03:46] <@SoFarFetched> Then I boot up DbD and such shit for barely starting LUL
[4:03:47] <%TheFramedWarlock> Basically "Feminists" that claim that Trans people existing is a danger to women and that Trans women are male predators
[4:03:48] <rissaleigh14> Maybe
[4:03:48] <Thewoodentree> THAT SEEMS SUPER COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO SOMEONE WHO IS BLISTERINGLY "PROGRESSIVE"
[4:03:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Flo from Progressive should be a D/BD killer
[4:03:50] <@SoFarFetched> suck shit*
[4:03:56] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Play more, Pat, play more!
[4:04:03] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @Thewoodentree That's right, Jay!
[4:04:05] <%vaporousTippler> Figures we never got to see Tolkien on twitter, but we get this twit instead.
[4:04:08] <PanicSwytch> They should put the monster from Jeepers Creepers
[4:04:14] <ittla> put rawhead rex in dbd
[4:04:15] <Phrickshun> JK Rowling: ‘People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud? Lol, that's a rough one
[4:04:18] <%DappercatEsquire> Ellen Page from Hard Candy should be in DbD
[4:04:22] <%MagicBeanBurrito> eldritch garfield should be a killer
[4:04:32] <+Estuko> @Phrickshun wyyymyyn
[4:04:32] <+joshujoestar> the new set for spirit and oni are amazing
[4:04:36] <%Mister_McDerp> there's an unfortunate amount of "progressives" who are anything but progressive
[4:04:47] <+tigerfang86> Extra large pat streams
[4:04:49] <+tigerfang86> usedSweat
[4:04:51] <%xxshadowxx416> if pat ever play re resistant he a Daniel player
[4:04:51] <%Binary_Fireball> so are they going to put jk rowling in DBD?
[4:04:56] <%Binary_Fireball> because that would be hilarious
[4:05:00] <Kain5707> imagine a Winter Lantern from BB in this game
[4:05:01] <%TheFramedWarlock> What does this killer's gun do ?
[4:05:03] <+tigerfang86> !BACK AT RISK!
[4:05:04] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah and it sucks trying to stream while feeling pain
[4:05:08] <%BoneofMalkav> @Mister_McDerp exactly.
[4:05:09] <rissaleigh14> Just because your characters are all gay does not make you progressive lady
[4:05:09] <GarettLefebvre> Did she try to figh tBane?

[4:07:08] <rufus2k2> IT'S A TRAP
[4:07:14] <Captain_Doomsday> Okay so this right here is why I don't see the appeal of Deathslinger.
[4:07:21] <+tigerfang86> @SoFarFetched PrideCheers
[4:07:25] <+heretostream> Why does chat dislike DBD? It's great
[4:07:25] <StarkMaximum> @SoFarFetched heck you. jk. love you.
[4:07:29] <Captain_Doomsday> Huntress: Hit -> Damage
[4:07:33] <+joshujoestar> thoughts on the survivor being heather over james for the SH chapter?
[4:07:38] <+feMC_is_best_girl> @sofarfetched atpQuan
[4:07:44] <%bevyrage> if you think a flashlight isn't bright enough to stun you've only dealt with those kiddy-flashlights that you can buy at a dollar store. proper flashlights are BRIGHT AS FUCK
[4:07:53] <%ChaosAethr> Whats the Gen Count?
[4:07:55] <%mMayrro> why did she make opera noises LUL
[4:08:00] <rissaleigh14> Pat loves Megs
[4:08:04] <Captain_Doomsday> @heretostream DbD is one of the most awful games I've ever suffered an addiction to but it's fun at really low ranks where you don't feel the sweat and hatred.
[4:08:04] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @SoFarFetched no thank YOU tbh we dont have jack for power to shape the atmosphere in chat and good modding helps keep good people and yeets the shitters
[4:08:05] <%jobbedbone> DBD is the lays potato chip of streams Kappa
[4:08:13] <+tigerfang86> yeah like super high power flashlights can set stuff on fire
[4:08:14] <%bevyrage> wait did he hit both
[4:08:16] <%weissguard> @SoFarFetched I only mean roast duck jokes in jest. It's been fun. psaUp
[4:08:17] <rufus2k2> HEY NOW LAYS SOUR CREAM IS GOOD
[4:08:25] <tetriata> @Captain_Doomsday Deathslinger has no windup and gets results out of very aggressive shots that Huntress can't make
[4:08:30] <%DesertPenguin> shoot her!
[4:08:39] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> i still dont know how i feel about DS
[4:08:51] <+tigerfang86> The huntress' hits are actual hits too right
[4:08:57] <+DontMindMee> did they ever update the game to encourage not just camping
[4:08:58] <+tigerfang86> you gotta drag the guy to you to hit them for DS
[4:08:58] <%TheFramedWarlock> DBD looks cool on stream, but when I tried it it felt really horrible to play
[4:08:59] <%Kataguro> I'm really feeling it
[4:09:05] <HarraceHarrison> You can avoid losing STBFL by breaking the chain on her, but if she realizes what's going on she wont struggle and wastes a ton of time
[4:09:11] <Gutsandlove> dont jinx it
[4:09:11] <%Pilzkun> they're caught in pat's rhythm
[4:09:19] <rissaleigh14> Camping is still a thing
[4:09:19] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> its a late stage pvp game
[4:09:19] <Captain_Doomsday> @tetriata Those shots have to be on open terrain though or he'll just stun himself. Only Trapper, Legion, and this guy can gimp themselves.
[4:09:21] <Joem1k> i really wonder when DBD2 will be made
[4:09:22] <+theKingRamses> @sashagreenspiderqueen it's a perk you can wait out the timer for if you have a good enough memory
[4:09:24] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> its always like that to get into
[4:09:24] <%deviljhojho_> wait this guy has a gun?
[4:09:26] <%deviljhojho_> Why?
[4:09:33] <Flea_of_Flames> That just sounds like horror game controls in general
[4:09:36] <%Binary_Fireball> to impale people with
[4:09:40] <+tigerfang86> TRY HARDER THO
[4:09:40] <%deviljhojho_> oh thats all right then
[4:09:46] <%Mister_McDerp> because GUN is the ultimate power
[4:09:47] <%Binary_Fireball> yup haha
[4:09:47] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @deviljhojho_ its not super long range but its still pretty busted
[4:09:51] <%DappercatEsquire> pro gamer strats
[4:10:01] <%deviljhojho_> @sashagreenspiderqueen hey man as long as it aint using bullets fine by me
[4:10:01] <hartbot10> KAPOW
[4:10:03] <+tigerfang86> @deviljhojho_ it's for dragging people to him scorpion style cause that shit owns
[4:10:04] <lostcolors> nice try on the red glow manipulation
[4:10:05] <+BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Xenoblade YOU COWARD]\
[4:10:07] <Thewoodentree> If you think about it guns are just realy fast knives
[4:10:07] <%mMayrro> who's he playing as?
[4:10:08] <Captain_Doomsday> Everyone memed guns on the reddit, so they made someone with a knife on a chain.
[4:10:09] <%corgispudmen> @PatStaresAt you should watch DBD case files by Bricky
[4:10:11] <+tigerfang86> LMAO
[4:10:12] <EmpyreanMAULER> q
[4:10:16] <tetriata> @Captain_Doomsday Terrain problems aren't usually that bad, and for first hits it doesn't matter anyways
[4:10:16] <+pectusumbra> So I'm looking at the new silent hill stuff, and I don't understand one of Cheryl's perks. Apparently she can block a generator herself for some reason?
[4:10:18] <%deviljhojho_> @tigerfang86 If it works, it works
[4:10:18] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> yeah its at least creative design more than just SHOOT
[4:10:19] <Decarcassor> @DontMindMee If all you do is camp, you are not going to rank up as killer. But the camping discussion is a complicated matter.
[4:10:24] <%bevyrage> aw
[4:10:27] <Joem1k> @PatStaresAt Have you or paige tried playing Hunt : Showdown ?
[4:10:34] <+tigerfang86> CRAZY TALK
[4:10:37] <rissaleigh14> Camping will definitely be a problem in low ranks
[4:10:40] <Joem1k> i've heard that's a pretty good PVP PvE game.
[4:10:43] <+tigerfang86> AHAHAHAHA
[4:10:46] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan imagine running towards the hooks twice
[4:10:46] <%Kataguro> Look up

[4:11:00] <+zepelinnn1> he cant look uo chat, he was animation locked
[4:11:00] <Thewoodentree> @corgispudmen And he should watch his Warhammer 40K lore videos
[4:11:00] <SnapKick> haha fleshlight is a fun fair mechanic (:
[4:11:10] <Decarcassor> @pectusumbra While a generator is blocked, it does not regress and the killer can't touch it either. It can be advantageous in some situations.
[4:11:19] <Captain_Doomsday> He had a moment to look up. I know what a perfect flash looks like.
[4:11:21] <+pectusumbra> got ya
[4:11:30] <Reanimator83> Pat when are you gonna play Hunt: Showdown?
[4:11:40] <+tigerfang86> S U P
[4:11:43] <%DappercatEsquire> revegeance
[4:11:52] <+zepelinnn1> when you pick up a survivor from the ground you are locked in for a while and prime flashlight targer
[4:11:54] <%DesertPenguin> That turned into Vanquish
[4:11:56] <+tigerfang86> is it really revengeance when you're a horror movie villain

[4:12:36] <koolaid_kevster> pat ever gonna do a skull girls stream to brush up for evo?
[4:12:46] <Captain_Doomsday> "Bitch! How dare you live!?"
[4:12:52] <lostcolors> you should be more mindful of your pop goes the weasel or consider taking it off
[4:12:58] <ManfredA> Skullgirls might be a bad idea to touch for a bit
[4:13:09] <Captain_Doomsday> To be fair, Pat was slamming gens constantly that Oni game.
[4:13:14] <rufus2k2> pat you should use Caleb's lines from Blood for this
[4:13:17] <%DappercatEsquire> Didn't the co creator of Skullgirls say some dumb shit?
[4:13:18] <%Bailey__gaming> hey guys what I miss
[4:13:18] <$Dakuu75> @koolaid_kevster I think he's jsut gonna go in raw, for the lols.

[4:13:42] <+theKingRamses> that pallet drop
[4:13:44] <+OhioNitsud> get over here!
[4:13:47] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> just the tip
[4:13:52] <Captain_Doomsday> If Pat switches from declarations to commands, can he trick Crazy Talk?
[4:13:56] <Thewoodentree> Everytime he says Meg all I can think about is the Jason Stathem Shark movie
[4:13:56] <StarkMaximum> @DappercatEsquire He like immediately apologized
[4:13:58] <+tigerfang86> Deathslinger can have a little bit of stabbing
[4:13:59] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> she wasted the godpalet
[4:14:00] <+tigerfang86> as a treat
[4:14:07] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> we've seen that trying to trick crazy talk backfires
[4:14:13] <%DappercatEsquire> @StarkMaximum Fair enough
[4:14:20] <$Dakuu75> can you shoot someone on a second floor and drag them down to the ground floor?
[4:14:20] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> the only thing that matters to crazy talk is that pat be a fool
[4:14:26] <+tigerfang86> what a scream
[4:14:29] <Captain_Doomsday> Why do Survivors always think drops are their friend? Only if you have Balanced.

[4:32:09] <%Ner234> LuL
[4:32:10] <KingKZ> Do another match. You can't have that bootyjuice be the end.
[4:32:12] <$Afterman_> face camp that bvitch
[4:32:12] <SGrim> What did you think they were doing?
[4:32:14] <+SausageShogun> great job pat LUL
[4:32:15] <SnapKick> You were just walking to a door that clearly had no one on it
[4:32:16] <+lethallylactic> You kind of handed them that one.
[4:32:16] <%chronotriggerhappy123> because they were waitying?
[4:32:17] <%TheWinged7> GG pat only 7 missed harpoons
[4:32:18] <SnapKick> Why did you just give her up
[4:32:18] <Ujean917> WHAT A GAME
[4:32:19] <%Kataguro> Stream Displeased
[4:32:19] <+Estuko> D I S P L E A S E D
[4:32:22] <+FOGSHIE> Start camping hooks, my guy.
[4:32:24] <Thewoodentree> AYYYYY
[4:32:24] <+AXL808> "Entity Pissed"
[4:32:26] <rissaleigh14> They likely just followed you
[4:32:27] <$Dakuu75> bummer
[4:32:28] <%Kaask> psaWrong
[4:32:28] <TyrantBelial> Why are you not camping hooks.
[4:32:28] <%DappercatEsquire> AUDIENCE DISPLEASED
[4:32:29] <hoopray> clown?
[4:32:31] <%spiritofmojave> Entity HATES it
[4:32:37] <+Rararachan> entity big mad
[4:32:37] <+Estuko> isn't camping hooks like, just bad play?
[4:32:38] <+BeezusHrist> Jane splashed her booty juices in your face @PatStaresAt
[4:32:40] <lostcolors> no need to camp at all
[4:32:41] <$Afterman_> not at that point
[4:32:41] <+pectusumbra> maybe can end on a clown game then it doesn't matter how bad it goes
[4:32:41] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> whoever says camp hook piss off
[4:32:43] <+TheEighthNobody> Once the exit gate's open it's not
[4:32:43] <%Aydarkzero> nah
[4:32:43] <+Infernal_Dalek> She was teabagging at the gate
[4:32:43] <+SinisterBroccoli> What happened to play to win?
[4:32:45] <+Infernal_Dalek> BM the BMer
[4:32:46] <ThirdPersonPhil> Play To Win
[4:32:47] <%dekkitout> Bowel movements?
[4:32:49] <%Ner234> Not at endgame
[4:32:49] <yeetdabsenpai69> that was like the only case camping is understood tho
[4:32:50] <$Dakuu75> against the survivors that tea-bag at the exit? fuck um. \
[4:32:51] <+RenoDeGeneric> Ain't no such thing as BM when you win
[4:32:51] <%chronotriggerhappy123> at that point camping is not bm, because they already had the door open
[4:32:52] <Thewoodentree> NOW YOU CARE ABOUT HONOR?
[4:32:55] <TyrantBelial> PLAY TO WIN.
[4:32:55] <rissaleigh14> We don’t BM here
[4:32:56] <aeonicvector> yeah, but they were being bitches and trying to score extra on you, punish THAT atleast
[4:32:56] <$Caped_Eggy> You need the BM with all those misses LUL
[4:32:57] <%Kataguro> Haunted Ground is fun
[4:32:59] <penitentpentwitch> They were BMing you by healing at the gate
[4:33:00] <koolaid_kevster> pat got smacked
[4:33:01] <%MajorCrasher> camping is bm, boring, and makes you lose points
[4:33:06] <EmpyreanMAULER> pat, you are aware that you don't have to reel them in all the way before lunging to hit with basic, right?
[4:33:08] <Reanimator83> If a door is already open camp
[4:33:09] <Decarcassor> @PatStaresAt There is no shame in protecting hooks during the endgame. Its not like you have anything else to do.
[4:33:14] <%chronotriggerhappy123> i could care less about honor
[4:33:18] <Zeldrick> Bowel Movement?
[4:33:21] <SnapKick> @PatStaresAt When you harpoon someone, walk backwards while reeling them in. They get zero left/right movement
[4:33:23] <+AXL808> ah DBD, a game that I genuinely like to play but hate at the same time
[4:33:25] <+TheEighthNobody> @PatStaresAt it's generally not considered BM to camp hook once the Endgame Collapse has triggered
[4:33:25] <+BeezusHrist> Camping shrinks the size of your penis. True story
[4:33:26] <rissaleigh14> Not camping means more points and that’s what matters
[4:33:27] <@SoFarFetched> to be a man you must have honor,honor and a peeeeeeeenis
[4:33:28] <%Kataguro> Sets up fake totems. If they break one, it makes everyone Exposed for a minute
[4:33:30] <TyrantBelial> I thopught this was about winning.
[4:33:40] <+feMC_is_best_girl> ive always wanted to play haunting ground from suzis vid, so expensive tho
[4:33:42] <%bevyrage> that makes sense actually
[4:33:44] <%Mister_McDerp> just like fishing
[4:33:45] <%Dementedpenguin> That's a thing? o_O
[4:33:46] <EmpyreanMAULER> like you could cancel the reel in
[4:33:46] <+The_Butterfly_Man> yea walking back and winding is what you gotta do
[4:33:50] <+nvschultz1325> nvschultz1325 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:33:51] <%Dementedpenguin> I need to tryb that next time
[4:33:55] <%king_wragles> @SoFarFetched Action Bastard? You're on Twitch?
[4:33:55] <EmpyreanMAULER> that way you don't get stunned
[4:33:56] <%Ner234> @SoFarFetched I haven't heardd that n a lng time LUL
[4:33:56] <TyrantBelial> Or is it more important to just gain points, regardless of the losing?
[4:33:57] <penitentpentwitch> Insight Gained!
[4:33:58] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @PatStaresAt dosnt work if they play with a macro
[4:34:00] <+bugz_munny> yo thats cool
[4:34:07] <Thewoodentree> Ah yes, the wild west, well known for its whaling industry
[4:34:14] <@SoFarFetched> @king_wragles @Ner234 psaDab
[4:34:17] <+anthonywilde1994> he sitting like the guy from the wow ep of southpark xD
[4:34:20] <HarraceHarrison> To be fair, when the gates are open and you've got someone on a hook, it's not like you have other things to look after. That's the time when I can totally understand a killer hanging around the hook, because where else are they gonna go?
[4:34:21] <Glaicus> Yee and I cannot stress this enough HAW
[4:34:33] <+SinisterBroccoli> God I could never like this game LUL
[4:34:55] <%Dementedpenguin> I have a like/hate relationship with this game
[4:34:56] <+TheEighthNobody> @PatStaresAt Whispers is good on Slinger
[4:34:59] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @PatStaresAt they can bound keys combinationsto only 1 to habe full control on the keyboard/mouse
[4:35:06] <Sotetsu> I love this game.
[4:35:14] <+The_Butterfly_Man> whispers is good on pretty much everyone
[4:35:17] <penitentpentwitch> There's probably race conditions for if the game loads while at the same time the store is open
[4:35:22] <+The_Butterfly_Man> its just a infromation perk
[4:35:25] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt So.....about more Warhammer....
[4:35:34] <T_Sasquatch> I'm still amazed this game got so popular
[4:35:34] <Decarcassor> @PatStaresAt Don't listen to Whispers advocates. They will tell you the perk is good for everything.
[4:35:35] <%Kataguro> You hear when someone is in your terror radius pretty much
[4:35:35] <EmpyreanMAULER> next time you have them reeled in most of the way, try holding down your basic to cancel the spear and start lunging forward with basic
[4:35:38] <+The_Butterfly_Man> the perk also glows @PatStaresAt
[4:35:40] <HarraceHarrison> Just look at the icon, it glows when people are near
[4:35:42] <lostcolors> the whispers don't matter, the perk lights up when someone is within range
[4:35:47] <+TheEighthNobody> @PatStaresAt Because he's 110% the less map exploration you have to do the better. So if you can identify when someone is within 32 meters of you and use that to figure out which section of the map someone is hiding in
[4:35:48] <%Piemono> Stop reading, then you'll be able to hear
[4:35:48] <Captain_Doomsday> Whispers lights up when it's active.
[4:35:52] <SnapKick> >that nea xenoConcern
[4:35:56] <@SoFarFetched> Man Nea is gonna be SO easy to spot with that hair LUL
[4:35:56] <HarraceHarrison> There are whisper sounds, but people just use the perk icon lighting up
[4:36:01] <%TheHeroAppears> just use your eyes
[4:36:03] <+SinisterBroccoli> I feel like this is a game where if you have really good survivors, it's almost impossible for the killer to win
[4:36:09] <%코코꾸라> David King - YEET
[4:36:10] <@SoFarFetched> YEAH ITS LIKE HOT PINK
[4:36:11] <%Fooguwu> hear and THEN see
[4:36:13] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> ohnGasm ohnGasm
[4:36:14] <%DappercatEsquire> why do they look so short
[4:36:21] <ManfredA> @SinisterBroccoli it's basically stacked in their favor and they get to voice chat
[4:36:22] <%TheIrritableDespicable> use those peripherals
[4:36:23] <%Fooguwu> is that cool lightning?
[4:36:24] <rissaleigh14> Neas don’t care about being spotted
[4:36:25] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @SinisterBroccoli thats basically red ranks wit coms and swf
[4:36:27] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @SinisterBroccoli most of the time depends on layout most of the time
[4:36:28] <Thewoodentree> She has....opinions
[4:36:29] <%BunnyEmperor> the attack here hairstyle
[4:36:30] <rissaleigh14> They do the loops
[4:36:33] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> ohnKoji ohnKoji ohnKoji ohnKoji ohnKoji ohnKoji
[4:36:33] <+zepelinnn1> depends on what you call 'win'
[4:36:34] <%spiritofmojave> Bright light-up sketchers pink LUL
[4:36:36] <zamzoph> You mean that if a team is good, they win?! D:
[4:36:43] <+anthonywilde1994> grrr
[4:36:45] <%Dementedpenguin> Survivors = 16 perks and communication. Killer = 4 perks. 4Head
[4:36:46] <StarkMaximum> discord, i'm howling at the moon
[4:36:52] <theloganbrand> But I play alone
[4:36:53] <%TheHeroAppears> let the killer do a spooky voice
[4:36:58] <+RenoDeGeneric> add voice chat but make the killer be able to hear it
[4:36:58] <+The_Butterfly_Man> don't think they will ever add voice chat
[4:37:00] <koolaid_kevster> your a great killer though pat
[4:37:00] <+Skelegroove> It seems like the map makes a pretty big difference too
[4:37:00] <Manjove> let the killer hear the Voice Chat when in his radius
[4:37:04] <+BloodyBurney> evolve was the same, good tteam of hunters could crush you no matter what
[4:37:05] <+anthonywilde1994> let the killer hijack comms
[4:37:11] <ManfredA> good idea but they'd just use discord to cheat
[4:37:13] <rissaleigh14> I would not join voice chat anyway
[4:37:16] <Captain_Doomsday> The devs are STUBBORN.
[4:37:18] <Djinnazz> that doesn't make sense, even L4D/2 has voice chat.
[4:37:18] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Manjove mute the game jump on discord
[4:37:18] <+LoyalHeretic> someone said warhammer
[4:37:19] <StarkMaximum> isn;t that exactly how Friday the 13th works? The killer can hear the survivors' voice comms if they're nearby
[4:37:27] <%TheIrritableDespicable> chat was toxic in friday the 13th, would not do it here
[4:37:27] <Thewoodentree> Cant add voice chat, universal fear of TOXIC behavior across the board
[4:37:28] <+azure22900> Joining as a group should nerf the survivors depending on how many players are in that group.
[4:37:28] <Captain_Doomsday> They will commit to every bad decision they've ever made and then be smug about it.
[4:37:35] <%DappercatEsquire> new tech
[4:37:42] <$Dakuu75> lol
[4:37:43] <BlacSoul> or add voice chat, and let the killer hear them
[4:37:46] <+The_Butterfly_Man> yup walking back is just what you gotta do
[4:37:46] <ha2ken> Do combo
[4:37:48] <%Dementedpenguin> Basement Wars begin
[4:37:51] <%Mister_McDerp> I bet deathslinger loves fishing
[4:37:53] <%DappercatEsquire> Let the killer call survivors a dumb bitch
[4:37:56] <rissaleigh14> At least we can reel in the toxicity without comms am I right?
[4:37:59] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @BlacSoul mute the game jump on discord
[4:37:59] <%Fooguwu> D:
[4:38:05] <+anthonywilde1994> noice
[4:38:08] <StarkMaximum> Pat I think that's just you
[4:38:08] <blue6sub6remnant6> Don't worry. They rarely die on the first hook.
[4:38:08] <+The_Butterfly_Man> untill after game chat thats the toxic zone
[4:38:09] <Captain_Doomsday> Just make voice chat optional. It'll still have Discord if there's ANY downside to the in-game
[4:38:11] <%Nekros4442> Imagine if the Killer could voice chat to survivors close to them
[4:38:12] <%Typhaeon> Let the hate FLOW through you
[4:38:13] <$ragingbrachy> yeah thats... great...
[4:38:15] <studleydoorite> but I want them to know how mad I am
[4:38:15] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> thats just any pvp game tbh but the lack of chat just means go off bitch
[4:38:17] <%bevyrage> oh lawd she zoomin'
[4:38:18] <theloganbrand> DBD rule 1: Never stick around for post game chat
[4:38:24] <Thewoodentree> PLUS VOICE CHAT OPRESSESS. SOMETHING SOMETHING DEERGIRL
[4:38:29] <%TheIrritableDespicable> people do points and im already tilted as killer
[4:38:35] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> I think a lot of the Dbd matches by youtubers have it right, you can voicechat with fellow survivors, but the killer is in the call too
[4:38:38] <%bevyrage> he hair was a tactical advantage
[4:38:40] <+BloodyBurney> feel like the pink hair is actively detrimental to survival
[4:38:42] <SnapKick> DBD rule 1: always stick around for post game chat, especially if you lose
[4:38:45] <%TheWinged7> at lleast they ar eusing them all up for their team
[4:39:01] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> god the backpedal is busted
[4:39:12] <+worldbrand> i didnt know there was a fishing minigame in this, that's dope
[4:39:18] <$ragingbrachy> ?
[4:39:25] <+The_Butterfly_Man> god pallet down
[4:39:27] <+anthonywilde1994> THATS ALOTA DAMAGE
[4:39:29] <BlacSoul> @lwpabloelenano2hc then put it in anyways and make whispers stronger
[4:39:40] <%YaBoiShamoi> YaBoiShamoi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Yee to da Haaawww!
[4:39:43] <%dekkitout> That's quite a bit of damage
[4:39:53] <%TheWinged7> 1
[4:39:53] <%DappercatEsquire> 1 damage, please
[4:39:53] <+feMC_is_best_girl> YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT
[4:39:56] <%bevyrage> what if whispers gave the killer access to the person's mic
[4:40:01] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> is pat lagging?
[4:40:06] <%bevyrage> so the killer can hear people talking
[4:40:11] <Sotetsu> God DAMage it!
[4:40:19] <Captain_Doomsday> Just make BBQ reveal Survivors IRL
[4:40:22] <%BunnyEmperor> MLG
[4:40:25] <Captain_Doomsday> SNIPED
[4:40:26] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @BlacSoul you will see survivors bitch and cry for it to not happend and since more of the game is played by survivors...behavr will complain ike thei did with ruin
[4:40:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> There's should be voicechat but the killer can hear too
[4:40:38] <rissaleigh14> Surely they can add comms without wasting a perk slot though?
[4:40:47] <Captain_Doomsday> They can't do that, though. IF the Killer would hear in-game chat, everyone will keep using Discord
[4:40:49] <%Fooguwu> why
[4:40:53] <+anthonywilde1994> that killer gets super devastated when the line snaps
[4:40:56] <+Estuko> that hair colour is a debuf
[4:40:57] <Bamcrash> @bevyrage Then folks would just use discord or party chat anyway to avoid giving killer an advantage
[4:40:58] <+SinisterBroccoli> ttrue
[4:41:09] <Joem1k> LUL
[4:41:09] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> D:
[4:41:10] <Thewoodentree> lol
[4:41:11] <Captain_Doomsday> That's the mood
[4:41:12] <rissaleigh14> True
[4:41:14] <T_Sasquatch> REKT
[4:41:14] <Joem1k> they are trolling him at this point.
[4:41:14] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> for every one thinking to add comms in game, survivors swf will mute the game and jump to discord...
[4:41:15] <%Keyd00d> D:
[4:41:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pat about to have a heated gamer moment
[4:41:25] <%bevyrage> @Bamcrash no i mean, the game just turns their mic on for the killer, not that the person willingly turns it on
[4:41:27] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's gonna catch this pop star sooner or later
[4:41:28] <%TheWinged7> 3
[4:41:33] <%bevyrage> though i realize now that's an invasion of privacy
[4:41:34] <hoopray> Pat on tilt
[4:41:35] <+anthonywilde1994> gonna have 2 go scream in the mirror
[4:41:37] <%bevyrage> and can lead to some real bad shit
[4:41:43] <+anthonywilde1994> get out all the mad
