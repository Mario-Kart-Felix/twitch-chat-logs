[0:29:06] <$Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 seeing as Paige is here, i wanted to alleviate her fears and rebuke the outrageous accusation that i am, somehow, a "Foot Person." I wrote that disgusting Sonic tirade primarily to underline how gross the Sonic design from the movie was, aiming specifically for creepy weird Sonic, at the same time, i dindt want to go too explicit for fear of getting banned ect, so that id figure id go for something innocuous, but still icky, i so went with feet TL;DR Pat is a Foot Person not me

[1:13:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's never lupus.
[1:13:21] <+Nomicro4u> RACE WAR
[1:13:23] <+OkamiDude15> @1matheuw its when you surface from going too deep in water but you surface too fast so your body doesnt have time to adjust so it fucks you up
[1:13:25] <SkyPirateArcane> Essentially
[1:13:30] <dukenux> Also, like Oregon and Washington states sometimes
[1:13:34] <%Gray_skies1993> that mayflower shit LUL
[1:13:35] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s essentially the plot of IT
[1:13:37] <%stovetopism> Yeah shits fucked up here in New England. I actually deal with the fish people daily @AngriestPat

[1:13:49] <hntronium> hot fuzz mine
[1:13:50] <1matheuw> oh i think ive heard that before
[1:13:53] <acedeone> Christopher Columbus musta been the head priest
[1:13:53] <%RioGascar> I think it has to do with being the first place pilgrams landed?
[1:13:54] <%ShichiNoBushi> Maine gets it pretty bad if Steven King is to be believed.
[1:13:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> the bends is air bubbles in your brain that make you have a stroke.
[1:13:59] <%arcaderabbit48> I have been to Maine before. Stephen King undersold it
[1:13:59] <Major_monotone> It’s true, east coast is beast coast
[1:14:00] <Manly_BeardedOne> ok, sleep time. I'll catch the rest of this later

[1:14:06] <Badgerconda_> Florida would be fucking terrifying. have you met the people from florida, Paige?
[1:14:08] <EuropantLamprey> Flordia doesn't need anything to be spooky
[1:14:08] <InugamiTheHound> Florida is already scary
[1:14:09] <dekkitout> Florida Man assimilates Elder God
[1:14:09] <alrobot2014> this would be an everyday occurannce in florida
[1:14:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Florida is cursed enough in real life
[1:14:12] <dukenux> Cause Florida Man could easily beat up Cthulhu
[1:14:13] <FatherGreyBeard> Florida Man monkaS
[1:14:15] <@lewdskeletor13> Maine is literally hell on earth in Stephen Kong’s mind
[1:14:17] <Tucker0603> as a new englander...Im a mountain, forest, and lake man
[1:14:17] <Doodle_Taco> "The Florida Area"

[1:14:30] <%Teintstein> look up even more
[1:14:31] <%zombie_goasts> Floridian Lovecraftian horror is just a naked man covered in syringes, screaming/charging at you
[1:14:32] <WonderSign> florida is already a scary place lol
[1:14:33] <%Hasmuffins92> @AngriestPat The bends is a build up of nitrogen bubbles in your blood. As long as you are helicoptered to a hospital in a decent time they can put you in a decompression chamber and dissolve the nitrogen in your blood. Its painful but not wholly leathal. Certified diver.
[1:14:33] <aimlesshealer> Cosmic Horror game "Florida Man awakens elder god", let's get on it poeople
[1:14:34] <xelomaimhov> Alligator Gods are the reason behind "Florida Man."

[1:31:58] <ミュウレ4242> the flood happened in this town. innsmouth was raided by the national gaurd and burned down.

[1:46:26] <captainnathaniel> must had been a garlic festival went wrong
[1:46:29] <%arcaderabbit48> So is it a pun that the camera turns into a fisheye lens in the game about crazy fish people?
[1:46:34] <%ElenaManetta> Why is it when people worship sea gods, entire towns get fucked, but when people worship satan, maybe your family or first-born just gets fucked
[1:46:34] <+Grayhammatter> wha happun?

[1:46:54] <+BubbaRands> Looks fine
[1:46:56] <rytisone> weird dildo
[1:46:58] <DjFrostBite95> That's some old god shit right there
[1:47:01] <turf_wind_and_fire> Losing sanity = being in a late 90’s early 2000’s music video
[1:47:03] <%arcaderabbit48> @ElenaManetta Satan plays the long game. Sure its just your family now, but it'll be the whole world later on. Maybe
[1:47:04] <%marsanta> Bob the monkey
[1:47:06] <NewWillinium> . . .Why don't these guys just worship the Sun or FIRE like normal people. Praise Rh'llor
[1:47:07] <%RupanSen> it's just a kotobukiya statue

[1:47:15] <%puhff> Ol' Bob Throggy
[1:47:19] <Parapattern> When the doctors open up Paige's brain it'll be at one of those massive arena operating rooms. all the experts of the medical community will be there to look on in horror of what they find.
[1:47:22] <elrey745> Maybe you should go back and speak to the black-man for more info?
[1:47:27] <%PanicSwytch> Is this a sequel to shadowbringer
[1:47:27] <NewWillinium> Titania is a great ship name

[1:48:21] <+Grayhammatter> some sweet dames
[1:48:23] <dukenux> wait
[1:48:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's a gross bote
[1:48:34] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Much like zombie fiction, Cthulu crap falls apart when these artifacts are so transparently evil and the fact no one just says ""boy thats evil screw this I am going home'" makes some eldritch media feel silly
[1:48:36] <natebud> Use your smell-o-vision
[1:48:42] <dukenux> Fatal Frame!
[1:48:43] <$Jungos60> The bodies on the pier may reveal something

[1:48:50] <+BubbaRands> *vapors
[1:48:58] <Zereaux> fatal frame 0
[1:48:59] <aimlesshealer> @Jack_of_No_Trades People ignore obviously evil shit all the time
[1:49:06] <%MagickBurritoh> okay
[1:49:07] <dukenux> Space time Ripple
[1:49:13] <Doodle_Taco> @jack_of_no_trades I would pick some creepy shit if I saw it tbh
[1:49:14] <ミュウレ4242> trivia: a dame is a lady knight.
[1:49:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> the map is shaped like a map
[1:49:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> la!
[1:49:27] <zenith0111> @jack_of_no_trades In the Lovecraft novels they run away from the problem a lot! Eldrich Horror is a joke nowadays
[1:49:27] <CalderGaming> [Obra Dinn intensifies]
[1:49:27] <dukenux> la! la!
[1:49:30] <natebud> they must work for the mayor
[1:49:31] <NewWillinium> . .So are the Giant Blue Portals and magic powers something that the character knows about or is it just a gameplay thing?
[1:49:33] <SilverFaustX> capcom just did a huge backpedal and posted the leak on yt
[1:49:38] <dukenux> W-why is the rum gone?
[1:49:40] <thelonechris> Why is the rum gone?
[1:49:47] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @Doodle_Taco @aimlesshealer These are fair points.
[1:49:50] <turf_wind_and_fire> @caldergaming I want pat to play that game SO BADLY.

[1:50:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> I got the rum right here
[1:50:15] <mr_slaide> Power of gun.
[1:50:19] <Parapattern> Respect for a man who brings hatchets to a gun fight
[1:50:20] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @zenith0111 I actually had no idea that is really cool. Practical cowardice is tremendously respected.

[1:51:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> the rum has cthulhu in it
[1:51:37] <turf_wind_and_fire> Is ALWAYS because of the rum
[1:51:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just destroy any artifact you see
[1:51:39] <Doodle_Taco> The rum IS the artifact
[1:51:41] <+Estuko> FeelsGoodMan went back to my old job I was fired from to grab some things, learned almost everyone including two of the managers fought to keep me there
[1:51:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sea creatures? The one died by falling into water
[1:51:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Have we found a Cthulu?
[1:51:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> or yog shoggoth
[1:52:04] <Parapattern> The rum is Cthulu's Cthussy juice

[1:53:06] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @rumtumtugnutz stop taking my cthulu artifacts then jerk
[1:53:09] <+Grayhammatter> no
[1:53:13] <tanarath> MIND APACE
[1:53:14] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @zenith0111 See that is much more logical to me, I know very few works of horror hold up under the pressure of common sense, but that is what iI think is cool about Eldritch stuff. Acting realistically is what is your downfall when the evil is incomprehensible.
[1:53:16] <sparky77> !uptime
[1:53:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 53m.

[1:54:52] <@lewdskeletor13> Tis only a scratch
[1:55:00] <+BubbaRands> It's a flesh wound
[1:55:22] <ArmoredViking> I am going to say that it was old man Jinikens
[1:55:27] <turf_wind_and_fire> Man all I can think about now is the song the obra Dinn plays when you enter three journal entries
[1:55:34] <captainnathaniel> how many people must be in a hospital on this hellhole of a city?
[1:55:34] <@lewdskeletor13> @armoredviking That’s a good guess
[1:55:36] <Y2Jsan> yes
[1:55:40] <Doodle_Taco> @armoredviking Not old man Jinikens!
[1:55:42] <zenith0111> @jack_of_no_trades I love Lovecrafts writing style. The characters feel grounded in their actions and they make sense. Sometimes they are handling so rationally they don't have any deaths but instead find people go insane from the pressure or the realisation what they're fighting.
[1:55:47] <+KoyaMusa> oh, pat's barefoot
[1:55:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't tell me the swerve is that the protagonist is a fish person.

[1:59:06] <%juxtest> Axe wounds are the hot new fashion trend in the Sinking City
[1:59:09] <aimlesshealer> It's a quantum bottle
[1:59:15] <%marsanta> But why should he do work when he can make you do it?
[1:59:15] <%vectorless_peon> its an important bottle
[1:59:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you don't write my checks.
[1:59:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Got time to catch these hands
[1:59:31] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @zenith0111 Honestly I never actually tried reading his stuff because I feel overwhelmed by all the works based off his stuff, maybe I will give his original stuff a shot knowing it has those strengths. Thanks for telling me about it.

[2:00:26] <GalaxyCrusher> !uptime
[2:00:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 28s.
[2:00:30] <Lurantis_> you’re right
[2:00:34] <Novillion> To be fair almost every song about California is by RHCP
[2:00:37] <%marsanta> To hide from the people who went with him with axes?

[2:00:47] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Newcommers are not welcomed. removing a trail would be advisable.
[2:00:49] <InugamiTheHound> are you sure that glitch wasn't a feature in this game?
[2:00:50] <Doodle_Taco> What a funny fellow
[2:00:56] <mrvidicus> "Free beds left," hahahahaha. It's funny because a hospital charges you at least 2000$ just to lay in the bed, even if it's for an hour, hahahahaha.
[2:01:04] <mrvidicus> killme
[2:01:06] <%arcaderabbit48> This actually looks really good for the time period the game is set in
[2:01:08] <+JohnMarkley> good evening everyone :)

[2:01:13] <Lurantis_> Ambulance bill is $15,000

[2:01:18] <captainnathaniel> this hospital makes you worse, not better
[2:01:30] <turf_wind_and_fire> “This is our leech room! Brand new leeches and state of the art!”
[2:01:32] <%arcaderabbit48> why
[2:01:33] <zenith0111> @jack_of_no_trades You're welcome. His works are usually short stories and at most take like an hour to finish. My favorite story from him is "The Colour from Space" the pacing is amazing.
[2:01:33] <StripesUltimateEdition> insurance copay is 3k
[2:01:36] <NewWillinium> Whoooooo! Look at those Grisly fucking scars!
[2:01:37] <Y2Jsan> so much Staph
[2:01:37] <%arcaderabbit48> why would you do that
[2:01:41] <+bubblebasspickles> not paying 15k to ride the weeyoo wagon
[2:01:42] <%Gray_skies1993> and remember kids: never fish with dynamite

[2:02:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> leeches are rife with parasites
[2:02:16] <%snow_bush> She was asking for it.
[2:02:20] <%king_wragles> @MagickBurritoh hey, she doesn't go to your job and question your life choices does she?
[2:02:23] <EuropantLamprey> Leeches ARE parasites
[2:02:24] <TastySammiches> leeches literally ARE parasites
[2:02:24] <elrey745> Ah yes, the bloodborne hospital
[2:02:24] <+Estuko> I can't imagine leeches would feel going down your throat
[2:02:28] <@lewdskeletor13> Why tf you eating leeeches
[2:02:28] <dukenux> YOure doing it all wrong
[2:02:31] <%ShichiNoBushi> Mmmmm... juicy leeches.

[2:02:46] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @zenith0111 Okay, that one will go to the top of the list, thanks for the recommend. I never know where to start with prolific authors.
[2:02:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hmmm
[2:02:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> doubt
[2:02:51] <+Estuko> "I also happen to be a ... Vampire Slayer.."
[2:02:52] <+YabbaTroll> that man has pointy nipples
[2:03:04] <%happyface699> Nice abs
[2:03:09] <dukenux> must be cold in here

[2:03:20] <+Double_Tap_That> Abs-braham Lincoln
[2:03:21] <StripesUltimateEdition> nipples strong enough to pierce bandages
[2:03:26] <%Kahnicus> Captain Ahab won't come clean. His great white whale is the dreamer.
[2:03:28] <aimlesshealer> @Jack_of_No_Trades My favorite is At the Mountains of Madness. It's fascinating all the way through
[2:03:28] <%demegodz> @lewdskeletor13 The same one that knocked on Pat's roof!

[2:04:34] <+Grayhammatter> wtf?
[2:04:37] <@lewdskeletor13> 4 score and 7 abs ago
[2:04:40] <zenith0111> @jack_of_no_trades His stories are usually self contained events that don't need any prior knowledge to know what's happening. There is some overlap but nothing that makes it daunting
[2:04:45] <Ner234> THINGS
[2:04:46] <dukenux> The horror. The horror.
[2:04:48] <%Gray_skies1993> @lewdskeletor13 nice
[2:04:49] <Doodle_Taco> @jack_of_no_trades Check out "The Sahdoe out of Time" if you like the style, its a personal favorite
[2:04:53] <NewWillinium> . .Huh. Usually the Crew mutinies if the Captain tries to abandon the crew. Not the other way around
[2:04:54] <%happyface699> Does he have the ab v pointing to his dick
[2:04:58] <%juxtest> Do you know what those Throgmortons smell like when they're cooped up for days?
[2:05:02] <Doodle_Taco> Shadow*
[2:05:07] <+Estuko> "We saw an old bald man, with a farm filled with nothing but big tiddy eldritch women"
[2:05:30] <NewWillinium> In Vero Veritas
[2:05:37] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @zenith0111 Excellent that makes this much easier to start.
[2:05:38] <dekkitout> Can't riot if you're shitfaced
[2:05:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> area 51 is hiding all the big tiddy octopus women
[2:05:48] <+Binary_Fireball> i disagree

[2:06:30] <@lewdskeletor13> So they did crack
[2:06:32] <%happyface699> Pat is doing a Jojo pose
[2:06:36] <+Estuko> I have a deep fear of learning that something from the deep is looking at me
[2:06:43] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @Doodle_Taco And that will be added as well. My note page hates that spelling for some reason. Autocorrect hates the eldritch
[2:06:44] <aimlesshealer> Pat looking regal
[2:06:49] <%Aerkk> He's got those pinhole-pupil drug eyes
[2:06:52] <mrvidicus> That choice of facial hair is suicide. The fuck is that. Grew a beard, didn't get the stache? You Abraham Lincoln lookin motherfucker.
[2:06:54] <%Kahnicus> elder godding needs a good drunk or high to manage
[2:07:19] <Doodle_Taco> @jack_of_no_trades It was Shadow, sorry about the typo
[2:07:22] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @zenith0111 Thank you again, I suspect I will!
[2:07:25] <+Binary_Fireball> Ha Ha! you'll never get past these simple requirements that can be met by completing a series of side quests!

[2:20:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hey @Binary_Fireball
[2:20:19] <dekkitout> So in terms of Lovecraftian power scaling, where does the devil rank?
[2:20:20] <+Estuko> @TastySammiches LUL they love the fucking devil
[2:20:22] <aimlesshealer> @Binary_Fireball Cool Ranch is the flavor of poverty and regret
[2:20:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fuck u too guy
[2:20:23] <%happyface699> cool ranch is better
[2:20:25] <%colouroftheiris77> Cool ranch Doritos are an abomination
[2:20:27] <%GarbageNirvana> You ever think about how many of the Devil's body parts are just scattered around Earth
[2:20:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Cool Ranch is vile
[2:20:33] <+Estuko> @dekkitout he's a bully
[2:20:34] <Doodle_Taco> The cooler Ranch
[2:20:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Dude's gotta be having a hard time
[2:20:35] <+icekept> the true answer to that question is PURPLE DORITOS!
[2:20:36] <Lurantis_> @doc_ock_rokc didn’t they say they’re patching that out soon?
[2:20:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh, now the race war is on
[2:20:43] <%happyface699> cOOL RANCH IS BETTER
[2:20:44] <+Binary_Fireball> Im glad there are sane people here
[2:20:49] <dekkitout> So A-tier?
[2:20:50] <+KingGilbertIV> cool ranch is fine
[2:20:51] <+Tokanova> ranch, or cool ranch
[2:20:58] <aimlesshealer> I bet Cthulhu eats cool ranch
[2:20:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Lurantis_ Yeah apparently they did but I still want to make a cheap jab because i'm petty
[2:20:59] <+Binary_Fireball> Cool Ranch tastes like a hobo's armpit jelly
[2:21:01] <%Ferakin> Cool Ranch Doritos are the best ones, you uncutured swine
[2:21:12] <%happyface699> @ferakin Thank you
[2:21:16] <+Binary_Fireball> neither cool nor ranch
[2:21:16] <Lurantis_> @doc_ock_rokc pettiness gives all of us life uwu
[2:21:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh are we having Dorito's arguments? Nothing tops salsa verde
[2:21:21] <%RioGascar> look cool ranch makes you 😎 so what does every other flavor do for ya
[2:21:26] <+Estuko> @dekkitout there's a god that'd basically wipe out existence just by waking up because in that universe, we're all it's dream if I recall
[2:21:28] <%RioGascar> Nothing
[2:21:28] <Jolnir> lightly salted
[2:21:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you would know what hobo's armpit jelly tastes like, huh
[2:21:34] <Doodle_Taco> @garbagenirvana Based and greenpilled
[2:21:36] <weewii> sweet purple Doritos ain't bad, but I like my Doritos either cheesy, spicy, or spicy-cheesy
[2:21:38] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat are you still liking the game?
[2:21:41] <+Estuko> @dekkitout the devil is prob A-tier tho, since it'd go up to SSS tier
[2:21:43] <%Kahnicus> @GarbageNirvana Basically, if it's not Cool Ranch, it's good.
[2:21:44] <turf_wind_and_fire> 3D Doritos were great and i don’t care what you all say
[2:21:45] <Lurantis_> The best doritoes are Taqis fucking bring it chat
[2:21:45] <+Binary_Fireball> @Sphincter_Spelunker I read the review your mom gave on it

[2:22:21] <%RioGascar> What tier is jesus in lovecraft?
[2:22:22] <haisho> speaking of videogames, I watched E4S videos and it looked SICK. Too bad I'm hella casual to do that kind of content.
[2:22:22] <Badgerconda_> see also: Vampire the masquerade: bloodlines.
[2:22:28] <+Estuko> @king_wragles ye
[2:22:30] <%GyroBrando> Said vampire the masquerade
[2:22:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Like the witcher
[2:22:36] <%king_wragles> @Estuko balls
[2:22:37] <Ner234> @Lurantis_ ALL of us
[2:22:37] <dekkitout> I'd rate Big J A~
[2:22:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> and mass effect 1
[2:22:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> My mom's dead
[2:22:40] <12gagerager> Or STALKER
[2:22:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I win
[2:22:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Very low tier
[2:22:47] <haisho> jesus is like E tier
[2:22:47] <Lurantis_> @ner234 AT THE SAME TIME.
[2:22:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Jesus is super low teir
[2:22:48] <%Aerkk> The Witcher 1 and 2 also had top comedy
[2:22:51] <%waltzqueen> LOL
[2:22:55] <+timblenaut> lol @GyroBrando that's the best example
[2:22:55] <SoySocks> are you calling jesus a low tier god?
[2:22:56] <Ner234> @Lurantis_ NotLikeThis
[2:22:58] <+Estuko> jesus is pretty much F
[2:22:58] <aimlesshealer> Fuck you, Jesus is the toppest tier
[2:23:01] <+Estuko> @SoySocks get out
[2:23:03] <%RupanSen> @Badgerconda_ Bloodlines also had top tier writing and quest design tho
[2:23:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> and your brain wouldn't boil
[2:23:10] <%happyface699> @soysocks He just smokes weed all day
[2:23:11] <unclerizla> "there's something about fear it pushes me*
[2:23:13] <dekkitout> Wait, the Megatron?
[2:23:16] <+sixcubit> jesus's presence doesn't drive you insane
[2:23:17] <Doodle_Taco> We SMT now
[2:23:18] <%Kahnicus> Metatron
[2:23:18] <+ArcLifth> metatron
[2:23:20] <TheBlankAce> He can walk on water he's at least D
[2:23:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout yes
[2:23:21] <%Aerkk> Pretty sure if you hit Jesus he doesn't even counter you, he just lets you combo.
[2:23:21] <turf_wind_and_fire> AND HE WAS ALAN RICKMAN
[2:23:23] <Mr_Strut> No they weren't
[2:23:24] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Jesus is low tier because he doesn't try to fuck over the world, imo
[2:23:26] <weewii> you guys like Doritos with any particular dip, or do like them by themselves (like I do)
[2:23:26] <+KoyaMusa> yeah its like talking to a seraphim, you just can't
[2:23:28] <InugamiTheHound> metatron
[2:23:28] <dukenux> Jesus hang out with regular people, that's pretty low tier for an elder god
[2:23:29] <unclerizla> MEATRONE ONE
[2:23:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Jesus made himself low-tier so that we may be high-tier
[2:23:29] <+Estuko> He's translator
[2:23:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Jesus is B- and Azathoth is SSS+
[2:23:30] <dukenux> LUL
[2:23:30] <haisho> remember that angels were crazy SMT shit like a spinning sword of fire
[2:23:33] <TastySammiches> what about the starscream
[2:23:33] <+YabbaTroll> metaton?
[2:23:34] <%Nymphonomicon> Megatron?
[2:23:36] <%weissguard> That's not how it worked in muh SMT. Kappa
[2:23:37] <+Intolerable> METTATON?
[2:23:37] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Not when he's the iteral Lion of the Tribe of Judah with his robes soaked in the blood of his enemies, Pat
[2:23:38] <zenith0111> Are we talking about SMT?
[2:23:41] <dekkitout> Aw! I was this close to reading the bible...
[2:23:42] <%ShichiNoBushi> The ore in Zone of the Enders?
[2:23:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The fact that you can interact with Jesus means he's a low-tier god
[2:23:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Does he cast Almighty spells
[2:23:46] <weewii> migration?
[2:23:46] <filialpails> Noble Voice: FUCK YOU
[2:23:46] <rytisone> Metatron is my favourite decepticon
[2:23:47] <turf_wind_and_fire> Dogma is a great movie and you should watch it
[2:23:47] <InugamiTheHound> metatron ore is from zone of the enders
[2:23:47] <+Estuko> @GeneralSCPatton that's the... dumb idiot blind god right lol
[2:23:48] <Mr_Strut> No one understands how he divided the loaves and fishes or walked on water
[2:23:48] <%happyface699> Omikron
[2:23:56] <%RupanSen> I prefer Starscreamer
[2:23:57] <trainedtarget> just what we hear about. Jesus probably mind broke some people and that didn't make it in to the book
[2:23:57] <2Kidkinobi2> Who would win? Megatron or Metatron
[2:23:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Angels has to announce "FEAR NOT" because they were literal 7 winged monsters
[2:23:59] <DracaenaLeaf> "fresh"
[2:24:00] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat but it's fresh
[2:24:00] <%Ferakin> Jesus was a Stand User though, so people couldn't see his powers work but they saw the effects
[2:24:01] <$Taisuru> @king_wragles Ctchulhu doesn't try to fuck over the world either, it just happens if he exists
[2:24:01] <aimlesshealer> Jesus is so high-tier he can make himself pseudo-low-tier to talk to you
[2:24:03] <%gigglefists> Alan rickman best metatron
[2:24:03] <captainnathaniel> metatron is a curious one, he is the only angel that was once human, all other angels were original from god
[2:24:06] <@lewdskeletor13> Jesus is low tiered you cowards
[2:24:07] <+Estuko> @RupanSen Shockwave is my boy.
[2:24:08] <Ner234> I'd rather starve than eat ANYTIHTNG here
[2:24:08] <%RioGascar> Didnt they kill jesus cause of his powers in a sorta “burn the witch” style thing?
[2:24:08] <Maleicus> eat da fish gain its freshness
[2:24:10] <unclerizla> anyone ever listen to the ziggurat, Ninja from Die Antwoord earliest project?
[2:24:10] <dukenux> what a dingy ass boat
[2:24:13] <dekkitout> Though I'm more of a Galvatron mark
[2:24:13] <dukenux> i love it
[2:24:13] <Morsuzado> in that setting, there would either be the worst or best fish.
[2:24:13] <Doodle_Taco> Rememeber when Metatron shot lazer with his eyes in Nocturne?
[2:24:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @estuko Yup. All of reality is his dream, and when he wakes up... poof
[2:24:19] <VirtuaRailith> Would Pat be a fishman if he would be taller as a fishman than a Patman?
[2:24:22] <turf_wind_and_fire> @gigglefists doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro you’re goddamn right
[2:24:27] <%Aerkk> Combat?
[2:24:31] <+Estuko> @GeneralSCPatton there we go, you can't really go above that in terms of power lol
[2:24:32] <%Kahnicus> Asathoth!
[2:24:33] <QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> monkaS
[2:24:34] <Lurantis_> @doc_ock_rokc catholic teaching says that most of the angels who appeared are the lower leveled ones, that just look like humans with wings
[2:24:40] <%RioGascar> Alright if jesus is low tier whats the Highest tier he could fight and have a chance at winning
[2:24:40] <QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> oh bye
[2:24:42] <Lurantis_> The high tier angels that look weird stay in heaven
[2:24:44] <DracaenaLeaf> Cya

[2:24:54] <trainedtarget> PISS OFF GHOST
[2:24:54] <%king_wragles> @Taisuru that's true, but he also doesn't try not to either. Also aren't there more elder gods than just Cthulhu? I thought he was just the main name
[2:24:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Lurantis_ depends on your catholic school then
[2:24:57] <%happyface699> Can you tell me why you always look up at the night sky - pat(silent hill 3)
[2:24:57] <+Binary_Fireball> ooo calamari
[2:24:58] <mrvidicus> It was just fucking breakdancing!
[2:25:00] <ミュウレ4242> jesus might be a high tier lovecraftian wizard because of the depth of his arcane knowledge, but he's no abstract or living star in terms of power level.
[2:25:02] <haisho> are these things...doing fucking ROUNDHOUSES
[2:25:04] <VirtuaRailith> I think those things would be a lot scarier irl
[2:25:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Are those headcrabs
[2:25:09] <%Aerkk> It just wantsed to show you its sick lovecraftian moves
[2:25:12] <%Bt_Robot> Read "Kill Six Billion Demons" if you want to learn more about Metatron.

[2:26:03] <NumbusPlays> same thing but unironically

[2:26:09] <Lurantis_> New zealand is the wales of australia
[2:26:10] <+Binary_Fireball> One does not simply call a kiwi a dropbear
[2:26:17] <%happyface699> That silent hill 3 rap is great
[2:26:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> New Zealand is the Puerto Rico of Australia

[2:26:25] <%sshen> If it was Aussie it would still be english quiettKek
[2:26:26] <%GarbageNirvana> I still need to see Thor Ragnarok
[2:26:33] <+Estuko> @GarbageNirvana it's fun
[2:26:36] <$Taisuru> @king_wragles Yeah, there's a bunch, most would be as aware of earth and the life on it as we are to dust mites upon our person. The only one that comes to mind that would interract with us is Nyarlathotep.
[2:26:37] <@lewdskeletor13> @garbagenirvana Issa good movie
[2:26:38] <%rytyoung> in a Scottish show called still game a character calls a ghost a "spooky bitch" which is the best retort to a ghost
[2:26:38] <DracaenaLeaf> Yes
[2:26:40] <%Aerkk> I gotta admit I have said "PISS OFF GHOST" more than once in games after seeing Thor
[2:26:41] <MaeMae94> Fuck the ocean
[2:26:42] <Lurantis_> @doodle_taco it’s hard to describe because wales doesn’t really exist
[2:26:42] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat can John Carpenters the thing face off against one of the lovecraft monsters and win? Or what matchup does it need
[2:26:43] <%happyface699> @garbagenirvana FUCKING WATCH IT NOW
[2:26:43] <captainnathaniel> thats some powerful cthulurely on this house
[2:26:44] <$Jungos60> New Zealand is Australias Australia
[2:26:45] <+TridentBerryBurst> Nothing good ever came out of the ocean
[2:26:47] <%Ferakin> The ocean's unbelievably freaky
[2:26:47] <dekkitout> Lower atmospheric pressure does that
[2:26:48] <+Estuko> I still am terrified of the fucking ocean
[2:26:51] <dukenux> Mainly
[2:26:53] <Jack_of_No_Trades> We left it for a reason
[2:26:53] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Wait, .38 round? Is this guy running a revolver or a semiauto?
[2:26:53] <%RupanSen> I like clams
[2:26:55] <unclerizla> Not a fan of shellfish i tell you what

[2:27:21] <@lewdskeletor13> @icepickxiii The main character? Definitely not
[2:27:26] <+Estuko> @Binary_Fireball he'd nuke many things, people even.
[2:27:29] <trainedtarget> I only get noticed when I shitpost and I don't know what that means
[2:27:33] <ababyduck44> more like the Stinking City with all this gross stuff
[2:27:33] <%Aerkk> In Lovecraftian lore, the anus is basically endless and unfathomable, as in, it contains infinite fathoms. Pure storage.
[2:27:34] <unclerizla> pat you are gross

[2:27:40] <zenith0111> Why does this game have so many guns?
[2:27:40] <+IcepickXIII> @lewdskeletor13 Ah gotcha, kind of sounded like him for a sec lol
[2:27:41] <%king_wragles> @Taisuru Ya, can't really do much to impress the old ones. And if we could that would defeat the theme of Lovcraftian writing. Thanks for the info too!
[2:27:42] <%RioGascar> i both love the ocean and hate it, was struggling with going through stormblood recently cause theres a trench i had to swim to for a dungeon. Had to set auto walk and walk away form the screen. once i was down there CAMERA LOOKS DOWN AND ONLY DOWN
[2:27:43] <dukenux> just put that Power Armor in your inventory
[2:27:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @haisho no it was a click
[2:27:55] <weewii> I can't eat shellfish on account of my body refusing it's existence in my body
[2:27:58] <+Binary_Fireball> I love sea shanties and robbing people
[2:28:02] <%Aerkk> @king_wragles you can prance around playing a sick ass flute
[2:28:02] <+Binary_Fireball> I hate squid
[2:28:08] <californaya> god, this movement/camera just reminds me of so many games in the 360/PS3 era
[2:28:13] <+Estuko> @Binary_Fireball had a lot of fun in Black Flag lol, that game was a fucking blast for me
[2:28:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @weewii I'm so sorry
[2:28:17] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Well then that makes more sense.
[2:28:17] <%Aerkk> They love that flute shit
[2:28:23] <Lurantis_> Hey chat is calamari squid or octopus
[2:28:26] <%king_wragles> @Aerkk leave bard, your kind has no welcome here!
[2:28:28] <+Estuko> doots
[2:28:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> squid
[2:28:31] <InugamiTheHound> squid
[2:28:33] <californaya> Calamari is squid
[2:28:34] <%king_wragles> *one encounter later* Come back bard!
[2:28:35] <+Estuko> @Lurantis_ squib
[2:28:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Lurantis_ octopus
[2:28:40] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I am going to say this, with how jank this game is, the boat physics are pretty spot on.
[2:28:43] <+icekept> octopus
[2:28:44] <+Binary_Fireball> @Estuko Black Flag was the best AC because it had very little to do with AC and a lot to do with pirates
[2:28:47] <@commanderclaw> Hellmouths are good fun for the whole family
[2:28:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> No wait it is squid
[2:28:50] <Lurantis_> @doc_ock_rokc you’re the only one who said octopus, so you must be right
[2:28:52] <%ElenaManetta> This seems like a short game in general though
[2:28:56] <captainnathaniel> can't be worse than this hellhole on land
[2:28:57] <Doodle_Taco> Remember that Azatoth is the BIG DUMB
[2:28:58] <weewii> calamari is tentacles
[2:28:58] <%ElenaManetta> How long to beat
[2:28:59] <rytisone> gotta show off them features
[2:28:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Disreguard my madness
[2:28:59] <+Binary_Fireball> Squid is the enemy
[2:28:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Buffy the Vampire Slayer
[2:29:04] <captainnathaniel> maybe the master are nice
[2:29:12] <Lurantis_> Could you imagine colossal squid calamari?
[2:29:13] <haisho> kinda makes sense though. Makes you start knee-deep in the madness compared to most Lovecraft stuff
[2:29:15] <+Estuko> @Binary_Fireball I enjoyed the pirate stuff a lot more BECAUSE it wasn't assassin's shit involved lmao, I have the collector's item
[2:29:17] <%RioGascar> Nah pat we are going to devil teeth Not his mouth silly pat
[2:29:18] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat you have to backtrack through the ocean floor stage like 5 times and it ruins it, honestly
[2:29:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> from marvel 2
[2:29:27] <%gigglefists> my favorite horror film <3
[2:29:27] <Mr_Strut> It's just a slime
[2:29:28] <Y2Jsan> @AngriestPat don't inspect the wall murals down there too closely if you don't want your stream banned
[2:29:30] <$Taisuru> SHogoths are bitch tier by comparison
[2:29:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> The thing was origianlly pitched as a lovecraftian movie
[2:29:34] <%Aerkk> What about the John Carpenter movie "In the Mountains of Madness" whats that based on
[2:29:36] <+Estuko> @Binary_Fireball came with the figure and super cool flag and art book. love that shit
[2:29:38] <Mr_Strut> It's a cute maid slime.
[2:29:39] <ZazzyDoesStuff> So aparently the cyclops was a diving ship and judging from the little boat. your ass is jumpin off the dingy.
[2:29:50] <+Binary_Fireball> tbh John Carpenter's thing just sounds like a dick joke
[2:29:55] <+Estuko> @Mr_Strut yeeee I love that shit too lol
[2:29:56] <Doodle_Taco> You were going to say The thing about The Thing but you were a COWARD
[2:29:59] <+sixcubit> @Aerkk that's an original story, actually
[2:29:59] <Djinnazz> Well, Untill they don't.
[2:30:05] <%Cybermancer> @Mr_Strut I see you are a man of culture as well
[2:30:05] <%ryome> And it has a motive
[2:30:09] <@lewdskeletor13> But the Thing is a remake of a movie that was based on a book
[2:30:10] <%happyface699> @djinnazz Pretty much
[2:30:10] <Hyp3r4ctive> it may seem unnatural, but the "Thing" has a cohesive logic, like learning it jumps away from fire
[2:30:13] <%Mrbaconator> what about cthulu in power armor?
[2:30:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> the lovecraft monsters are horrible nonsense and i love that.
[2:30:15] <Charuzu> Shoggoths make sense. They are bio robo slaves made by aliens
[2:30:16] <%RupanSen> still the best monster in movie history
[2:30:16] <+Binary_Fireball> @Estuko I have so many mixed feels about that
[2:30:18] <+Estuko> doodBro Eldritch women need love too
[2:30:19] <@commanderclaw> Non Euclidean geometry is just geometry on a curve Lovecraft you moron

[2:30:35] <+timblenaut> not terrifying at all...
[2:30:36] <MoulesFritz> you'll end up going to this ocean floor level like 5 times, it's lame
[2:30:37] <mrvidicus> Oh yeah, here we go. The REAL JANK starts now!
[2:30:39] <%Aerkk> UNDA DA SEA
[2:30:40] <+Estuko> If there's gameplay in this deep sea shit I'm going to go fucking nuts
[2:30:43] <%GarbageNirvana> It's like you could be looking at this thing's ass while it's eating some dude in Cambodia or something
[2:30:43] <%ElenaManetta> That looks
[2:30:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> bring the stupid
[2:30:44] <+Grayhammatter> oh good, can't see a damn thing
[2:30:45] <%ElenaManetta> so fucking funny
[2:30:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> into the abyss
[2:30:48] <rytisone> weeeee
[2:30:48] <aimlesshealer> All jank originates from the sea
[2:30:50] <SoySocks> i hope there is a bends mechanic

[2:30:51] <NeroInfinite> Under the sea
[2:30:51] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I JUST had this nightmare
[2:30:52] <%ElenaManetta> The model is awkwardly placed inside the helmet
[2:30:55] <haisho> the viewports on that helmet look non-functional
[2:30:57] <%RioGascar> but what about the original form of the THE THING? Or is it implied there is no original form? And that the form it took in that spaceship was from another alien race and it changes to suit the host

[2:31:49] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah
[2:31:49] <%Gray_skies1993> @ElenaManetta we literally know more about Space than the deep ocean, so I'd say the ocean is scarier for sure

[2:32:25] <mield916> pull up your weapon wheel, pat
[2:32:25] <%ElenaManetta> It should be illegal to make any type of "exploration" vehicle that you cannot stand up in
[2:32:27] <%Deft_Thought> TIME TO GO
[2:32:28] <%RioGascar> ...wait @angriestpat what if THE THING took the shape of a lovecraft monster

[2:32:31] <chronoxgp> this water is suprisingly clear
[2:32:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commanderclaw I mean, technically there a bunch of different things that qualify as non-euclidean. You would learn about them in a high level math course on Topology. And any space that fails to adhere to mathematical laws would also count as non-euclidean.
[2:32:31] <+Tokanova> SQUAD MORALE BROKEN

[2:36:59] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I think the answer to his puzzle is to shoot him in the back of the head
[2:36:59] <%abakkus> don't like that
[2:36:59] <Dementedpenguin> If I went underwater and saw THAT shit.....
[2:37:01] <mrvidicus> "There is something odd about being near the scientists." Yeah, they're all proto-weaboos, look at them.

[2:37:41] <+hoenhime344> i like that sub animation.
[2:37:46] <natebud> Yeah i wouldn't take my eyes of the crazy guy
[2:37:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> All scientists are are weebs that never discovered anime and thus fel in love with physics instead
[2:37:47] <%marsanta> Why would they want to leave, their god is here
[2:37:47] <%abakkus> put him uhhhh out of his misery
[2:37:54] <%UncleAWOL> good thing you're a video game protagonist and can withstand some eldritch influence without going totally nuts
[2:37:55] <trainedtarget> Did anyone else see Apollo 19?
[2:37:56] <leargo> VIERA BOIS!

[2:38:11] <%Cn_alpha_02> camera
[2:38:13] <%Aerkk> @UncleAWOL I think its more that he is already totally and completely nuts.
[2:38:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @riogascar I think most ghosts are already losing it, but they would lose it even harder in the face of hardcore shit. There are lesser gods that traverse other dimensions, but get insano-annihilated when a bigger god throws them into even whackier dimensions.
[2:38:18] <%snow_bush> CAMERA
[2:38:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> eyes on the inside
[2:38:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Astrophysics is best waifu

[2:38:31] <ミュウレ4242> i wonder if his ape heritage helped him resist the tentacle madness.
[2:38:31] <natebud> They're putting on some kind of stage show
[2:38:35] <%weissguard> Eyes on the inside.
[2:38:35] <SoySocks> our eyes have yet to open
[2:38:35] <MoonObscure> Grants us eyes
[2:38:38] <Lurantis_> I love how there’s like 300, ”complete collection of HP Lovecraft’s work” books and none of them have all of them
[2:38:40] <+ArcLifth> is also stabbed in the head
[2:38:42] <eldritchart> whats in his mouth?
[2:38:46] <+Walopoh> Why'd ya spill yer beans?

[2:39:36] <%GoogleyGareth> Kreygasm
[2:39:37] <turf_wind_and_fire> Is his head weird or am I crazy?
[2:39:38] <SoySocks> snail girl
[2:39:41] <%RioGascar> Would a vampire that has immortality be able to fight lovecraftian monsters?
[2:39:43] <InugamiTheHound> chakra?
[2:39:47] <mrvidicus> "Cthulhu, huh? How does he taste?"

[2:40:07] <natebud> pain don't hurt
[2:40:07] <2Kidkinobi2> Glass him
[2:40:11] <zenith0111> I realise Lovecraft loved to show how the only way we stay sane is from not knowing the full truth. Just what works.
[2:40:12] <Lurantis_> This man is the wokest
[2:40:13] <+Grayhammatter> GLASS HIM
[2:40:14] <mrvidicus> Grima Wormtongue looking motherfucker.
[2:40:19] <InugamiTheHound> can you just kill them?
[2:40:22] <dekkitout> A vampire hopped up on elder god blood sounds like a recipe for an uber-lich
[2:40:22] <Deekman> Is that pat with hair?
[2:40:24] <mrvidicus> Peter Pettigrew son of a bitch.
[2:40:25] <sentientvin> @RioGascar are we talking alucard or dracula tho
[2:40:25] <captainnathaniel> i gotta give this game credit, I was never called a holy worm before
[2:40:27] <+Irkallu> @AngriestPat I bs'd the essays. 10/10 advice. Hopefully I did well on the MC today to pass. Find out in late October
[2:40:28] <%Aerkk> Depends on the type of vampire, you've got like Dio style vampires, classic Dracula style vampires, Castlevania Dracula style, etc
[2:40:31] <+Grayhammatter> oh man
[2:40:33] <MoonObscure> oh boi
[2:40:43] <%jerree66> Abandon them
[2:40:43] <%arcaderabbit48> BURN THEM
[2:40:44] <QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> nah quarantine this shit
[2:40:45] <mrvidicus> Kill them all Pat.
[2:40:47] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Leave them. they will only bring harm
[2:40:48] <MoonObscure> leave them
[2:40:50] <NewWillinium> Save them all!
[2:40:52] <InugamiTheHound> leave them
[2:40:54] <Bogart4321> more crazies :D
[2:40:54] <%Arxel1> Kill them all, even the children
[2:40:54] <Lurantis_> Kill em all
[2:40:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fuck em
[2:40:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Binary_Fireball) (warning)
[2:40:55] <$Taisuru> Abandon
[2:40:55] <2Kidkinobi2> Glass him Glass him
[2:40:55] <%Artimadare> chaos ending
[2:40:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> save them
[2:40:56] <Blank9> abandon, you're not killing them
[2:40:57] <turf_wind_and_fire> Kill them Peter. KILL THEM ALL
[2:40:57] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat If I recall once your mad yu are screwed
[2:40:58] <mrvidicus> Purge the quarantine. They live and die by your orders, Boss!
[2:40:59] <+ArcLifth> Both options make sense
[2:41:00] <%arcaderabbit48> Actually no, reswcue them for MAXX CRAZY
[2:41:00] <%Aerkk> Take Uncle Ben's advice: Kill them all peter, kill them all.
[2:41:00] <leargo> mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:41:01] <MaeMae94> let 'em starve
[2:41:02] <%SergeantSov> Leave them all
[2:41:02] <natebud> start a for profit asylum
[2:41:06] <%mh9s> kill em all
[2:41:07] <+Binary_Fireball> madness harem
[2:41:07] <SoySocks> do kill
[2:41:07] <%Gray_skies1993> normally I'd save them, but under these circumstances I say leave them
[2:41:08] <%crimsonharvest> in the books those affected by this madness almost always kill themselves
[2:41:08] <+JackMillerTime> what are those ? above?
[2:41:09] <%king_wragles> Eat them so you can still take them with you @AngriestPat
[2:41:09] <captainnathaniel> can't you nuke the whole place?
[2:41:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @riogascar Anything that even remotely derives from a human mindset can not handle the true nature of what the cosmos contains. Mammal brain just won't cut it.
[2:41:11] <Doodle_Taco> Take them to infect them, then kill them
[2:41:12] <%RioGascar> Do we know if the madness is in infectious?
[2:41:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> but pat you are now infected asw ell
[2:41:13] <NewWillinium> Save them Pat!
[2:41:13] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm no snail
[2:41:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kill them all, Pat
[2:41:16] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Given it's seems to spread by proximity, yeah
[2:41:19] <Macmo696> hmm take or leave the crazy men. seems like an easy answer
[2:41:20] <Djinnazz> I't kinda is.
[2:41:21] <+beetus_unlimited> If Peach had tentacles could you still love her?
[2:41:25] <dero45> Take a chip and eat it
[2:41:37] <mrvidicus> Do you have Albert in a can?
[2:41:40] <mrvidicus> Hehehehehehe
[2:41:45] <%crimsonharvest> is that factual or just what they told you
[2:41:47] <+hoenhime344> @beetus_unlimited watch drawn together. peach does have tentecals
[2:41:48] <+beetus_unlimited> You better let him out
[2:41:49] <%arcaderabbit48> So Albert Throgmorton started exuding a madness aura
[2:41:51] <+spiegelspike> not enough info yet, you might be able to cure it
[2:42:00] <InugamiTheHound> he went down and saw the old gods first and infected everyone else
[2:42:00] <eldritchart> but where is the oberon
[2:42:00] <%RioGascar> So wait this madness is CONTAGIOUS
[2:42:06] <MoonObscure> ooof
[2:42:08] <Lurantis_> Original pennywise was best pennywise
[2:42:13] <zenith0111> So madness was radiating from his body???
[2:42:13] <Ner234> CURSED
[2:42:14] <natebud> that voice does not fit that model
[2:42:14] <%Bt_Robot> The only way to avoid succumbing to the madness is to fight it with the fervor of a madman.
[2:42:17] <turf_wind_and_fire> Call Mermaid Man!!!
[2:42:23] <SoySocks> cursed amanyte shell
[2:42:24] <mrvidicus> Maybe Albert caused this madness. But who is the Arkham Knight?
[2:42:25] <Doodle_Taco> OCEAN MAN
[2:42:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Alright, look for a Dr. Dekker
[2:42:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> So technically, having that fishman put to death helped contain the spread.
[2:42:32] <Moonlight_Grimoire> wait, where's her? Where's that artifact?
[2:42:33] <%Maids4lyfe> that rock almost looked like a face
[2:42:34] <NewWillinium> Be a big hero Pat!
[2:42:34] <+Taglog7> BibleThump leaks
[2:42:35] <natebud> take them by the hands
[2:42:38] <%RioGascar> is radiation a lovecraft monster? We cant see it nor really comprehend it?
[2:42:39] <%UncleAWOL> Oh no! Look at this clearly clursed eldritch icon, better remove it for further study
[2:42:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> EVERY VILLIAN IS LEMONS
[2:42:51] <%Bt_Robot> Statue!
[2:42:52] <+hoenhime344> @RioGascar thats basically all lovecraftian dooms day vehicle explainable contagious madness.

[2:58:49] <%foreverN2dust> He wants you to fuck his wife to continue the bloodline
[2:58:49] <filialpails> I thought he was about to say herbert west
[2:58:50] <TastySammiches> the race war starts later
[2:58:51] <%ColonelRozum> @turf_wind_and_fire dont forget his uncle a Mr. Kong Donkey
[2:58:53] <+AXL808> CHOOSE YOUR HOUSE: House Apemen or House Fishpeople
[2:58:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mule4242 Wait, does the name actually show up? Or is the story concept just recycled?
[2:58:54] <+hoenhime344> you know why they call them al bed right? its cuz they laze around all day in bed
[2:59:02] <natebud> Who would win in a fight? One monkey-sized fish or ten fish-sized monkeys?
[2:59:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I'm not a thief, I'm a treasure hunter
[2:59:09] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Why do all Cthulhu games have you play as a detective type character?
[2:59:10] <captainnathaniel> lol, okay that was cool
[2:59:10] <eldritchart> so much hidden details
[2:59:16] <%arcaderabbit48> @natebud Is the battle underwater?
[2:59:21] <%Artimadare> "I want you to find out why someone disappeared in this hell hole"
[2:59:25] <%ColonelRozum> @hoenhime344 i say we go down there to those fish ghettos with some blitz balls....
[2:59:29] <ミュウレ4242> GeneralSCPatton, not the name, but the backstory.
[2:59:29] <turf_wind_and_fire> @ColonelRozum I think the whole family has a large home in the CONGO
[2:59:29] <+Estuko> @42nfl19 mystery/investigation type stuff
[2:59:32] <%Gray_skies1993> @42nfl19 my guess is it fits the genre best
[2:59:39] <natebud> @arcaderabbit48 there's a pool in the middle
[2:59:39] <Zombrocom> "I am a a collector of fine art" "So you want me to steal art" "Uhh... no. I want you to find a missing person, dick."
[2:59:44] <tanarath> Aww yeah, 1.35k exp.
[2:59:47] <Dementedpenguin> cthulu saves the world?
[2:59:49] <%ColonelRozum> @turf_wind_and_fire holy shit that movie is amazing LUL
[2:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:54] <+Shaggnar> Film noir vibes
[2:59:58] <miamimackjr> i think you drop a Dorito near your foot
[2:59:59] <+hoenhime344> @ColonelRozum BOOM! like fireworks!
[2:59:59] <%arcaderabbit48> @natebud Probably the fish then
[3:00:01] <%NWR_James> noir shit
[3:00:03] <haanss1> detectives are cool?
[3:00:05] <Hyp3r4ctive> attempt to rationalized the incomprehensible as a mechanic
[3:00:05] <%marsanta> Plus aren't most Lovecraft protags detectives?
[3:00:08] <+GreatBrightBlack> I want to play as the cosmic horror
[3:00:09] <%Aerkk> In the Fantasy Flight Arkham games they kinda just call everyone "Investigators"
[3:00:10] <turf_wind_and_fire> @ColonelRozum I've only seen reviews and clips of it. I really need to take time to watch it lol
[3:00:11] <+GreatBrightBlack> damn it
[3:00:15] <+PenmanLupine> Journalists and Doctors are also good Cthulu protagonists for the same reasons
[3:00:16] <%PinkSuprende> good excuse to know self defense in some capacity, etc
[3:00:16] <+AXL808> because no one else would stay around this crazy shit
[3:00:18] <%Aerkk> And they are investigating the mythos due to personal ties in some way
[3:00:21] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah, a banker would see this shit and go, "Maybe I should join"
[3:00:22] <+Swaggamanca> Playing the Call of Cthulhu pen and paper, my character was an Archeology professor and a bulk of it was looking for ancient cities
[3:00:22] <rytisone> Doom guy in 'Call of Cthulu'
[3:00:24] <%Artimadare> basically just need a reason to not nope the fuck outta there
[3:00:25] <%NWR_James> You could do a scientist
[3:00:25] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Get high time
[3:00:27] <%Nobrev> pat if you don't stop chewing into the microphone I'm going to have a gamer moment
[3:00:29] <%SergeantSov> Detective is one of many default "Inquisitive mind" archetypes.
[3:00:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just have your autistic son figure it all out and then the fish people will weaponize his autism
[3:00:30] <+Intolerable> LUCK
[3:00:32] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Air hike
[3:00:33] <%arcaderabbit48> Detectives in general make for fantastic player characters, narrators, and PoVs in general
[3:00:37] <natebud> In every other Lovecraft story the protagonist just runs away when things get too spooky.
[3:00:37] <%ColonelRozum> @turf_wind_and_fire boy is it somethin lol
[3:00:40] <+HyraFukit> Pat, are you a detective?
[3:00:46] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Some cthulu games have you as a journalist. Same reasonings.
[3:00:46] <%ShichiNoBushi> Cthulu kills like 1d8 Investigators per round.
[3:00:47] <%Aerkk> Doom Slayer would do really wel lfor himself @rytisone
[3:00:48] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Better save the level up points and never use them
[3:00:49] <Sitromxe> You said last time you wanted to complete the xp gain tree.
[3:00:49] <%foreverN2dust> Wasn't there one that increases quest rewards?
[3:00:52] <Moonlight_Grimoire> PI or Journalist are the two go to things, that or a Archaeology Professor, but, that's a little harder to rope in (look at Eternal Darkness for how to do it)
[3:00:58] <Doodle_Taco> Man imagine if you were reading Lovecraft and the protag goes "Okay I have two knowledege points"
[3:01:00] <+AXL808> old timey detectives are also notorious alcoholics
[3:01:05] <captainnathaniel> can't you, like, call the army on this place? are nukes a thing yet?
[3:01:06] <%NWR_James> doubt
[3:01:06] <tanarath> There are two that increase quest rewards.
[3:01:08] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I mean is he wrong?
[3:01:09] <%RioGascar> Even lovecraft itself has their characters be detectives or people of scientific minds
[3:01:09] <42nfl19> I would be interested in being the Ghost Busters of Cthulhu town where you clean up the daily mess of monsters.
[3:01:09] <+Sulfur_Boride> I come in, and the first thing that's presented to me is chip eating ASMR
[3:01:10] <ArmoredViking> I am so happy to catch your stream @AngriestPat
[3:01:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Save up for EX-Provocation!
[3:01:17] <tanarath> Pat didn't feel like them before.
[3:01:18] <TastySammiches> @captainnathaniel nukes are not a thing, this is lovecraft times
[3:01:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Detectives work well as protagonists because they are proactive rather than passive
[3:01:22] <+hoenhime344> no detective shovels doritos and redbull in their gullet as much as pat
[3:01:23] <%Gray_skies1993> @captainnathaniel it's the 1920's, so no nukes
[3:01:25] <%Dr_DangerPhD> detectives are also transient, reclusive by nature of their job
[3:01:37] <nerdblase> Detectives are logical individuals full of sanity, Cthulhu settings love to chip away at that.
[3:01:42] <%arcaderabbit48> Would a nuke work on Cthulhu?
[3:01:47] <natebud> @Gray_skies1993 just barrel-fulls of deathgas
[3:01:54] <Doodle_Taco> @arcaderabbit48 Nah
[3:01:56] <%Gray_skies1993> @arcaderabbit48 my guess is no
[3:01:57] <%Aerkk> Yeah, they dynamited the reef in one of the stories @arcaderabbit48
[3:02:02] <+palebluedots> Is this an early build @AngriestPat
[3:02:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If a boat can work on Cthulhu, a nuke might as well
[3:02:04] <+AXL808> @nerdblase bursting with sanity
[3:02:09] <%Gray_skies1993> @natebud fair enough
[3:02:17] <Nina96> oof
[3:02:19] <+hoenhime344> @arcaderabbit48 no. he technically dosent live in out plane of existance.
[3:02:19] <lethallylactic> LUL
[3:02:21] <+Estuko> FUCK ULL
[3:02:21] <%foreverN2dust> LUL
[3:02:22] <nerdblase> @arcaderabbit48 Cthulhu works on nukes.
[3:02:23] <+Estuko> LUL
[3:02:41] <tanarath> It's the rich part of town, Pat.
[3:02:42] <InugamiTheHound> they got cars and money
[3:02:42] <@lewdskeletor13> THIS IS GOOD EURO JANK DAMMIT
[3:02:46] <%Aerkk> Ghostbuster proton packs work on Cthulhu as seen in the documentary "The Collect Call of Cthulhu"
[3:02:47] <%UncleAWOL> The rich part of town isn't flooded
[3:02:50] <dekkitout> Nukes and Cthulhu also reminds me of the current Hulk series, man good stuff...
[3:02:51] <%UncleAWOL> color me surprised
[3:02:51] <natebud> choice eurojank
[3:02:55] <Youwereeatenbyalid> We do like our eurojank here
[3:02:58] <ミュウレ4242> cthulhu wasn't expecting a boat. a nuke he might notice and magic away, but steam engine has no electrical components or mind.
[3:02:58] <TastySammiches> wonder what lovecraft would've thought of nukes. Probably be ok with them since they only killed asian people.
[3:03:08] <%ElenaManetta> My standards for games must be really low because I see this and go, "Yeah, what's unfinished about it".
[3:03:10] <ShoggothLord> Does Throgmorton have a gay lover that ghosted on him? 'Cause I feel like he's having you track down a gay lover that ghosted on him.
[3:03:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShoggothLord I think that is what glover is
[3:03:34] <+Estuko> @ShoggothLord spot on that I'd gotta assume you've seen earlier parts
[3:03:35] <natebud> Not flooded, but the cars are all destroyed.
[3:03:37] <%Nobrev> it doesn't really seem unfinished but maybe unpolished
[3:03:40] <%UncleAWOL> who needs firemen in a town that's flooded
[3:03:43] <%UncleAWOL> and perpetually raining
[3:03:47] <%arcaderabbit48> @ShoggothLord Yes, with the addendum that we are tracking down one of many
[3:03:56] <haisho> @Nobrev Welcome to eurojank.
[3:03:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @arcaderabbit48 Nothing we can do would stop Cthulhu from respawning when the time is right. And if we're unlucky, he would respawn hella radioactive and not give a single fuck about his face-melting cancer aura.
[3:03:59] <einSynd> It never happened
[3:04:00] <ShoggothLord> Ahh, neat.
[3:04:01] <%miamimackjr> miamimackjr subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:04:02] <%foreverN2dust> @ShoggothLord I dunno, but there is something fishy going on
[3:04:02] <einSynd> Complete fabrication
[3:04:05] <%ElenaManetta> sTAND ON THE SPIKEY FENCE, IiDIOT
[3:04:11] <%RioGascar> Are monsters in that trendy blindfold movie lovecraft monsters? supposedly upon seeing them they make you want to kill yourself
[3:04:18] <Doodle_Taco> Our writers made this one up
[3:04:21] <captainnathaniel> the people intros part of town even look healthy
[3:04:29] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> oh wow i caught a live stream, dope!
[3:04:37] <+hoenhime344> water!?!?!? not redbull!!!?!?
[3:04:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> @riogascar Absolutely
[3:04:44] <+hoenhime344> is pat going healthy ?!?!?
[3:04:48] <%Aerkk> Pat wasn't streaming last week cause his computer caught on fire
[3:04:49] <natebud> Even if it's raining, they still need firemen. Ever hear about that fire at the Seaparks?
[3:04:51] <TastySammiches> @RioGascar go look up the leaked picture of the birdbox monster and you'll see why
[3:04:57] <%arcaderabbit48> @GeneralSCPatton That's a very good point. I hadn't considered if Cthulhu would remain radioactive upon reforming
[3:04:57] <rytisone> ahh, delicious hydrogen dioxide
[3:05:00] <ZazzyDoesStuff> hydration is a big theme
[3:05:06] <%Aerkk> Pat is just seeing all of the water falling from the sky and flooding everything in game
[3:05:11] <%Aerkk> The Thirst has started to consume him.
[3:05:18] <Doodle_Taco> Is Hydrobot a Cthullu cultist?
[3:05:22] <+hoenhime344> dihydrogen monoxidie
[3:05:24] <+Estuko> T H I R S T
[3:05:34] <@lewdskeletor13> Hail Hydrate
[3:05:37] <%Artimadare> apatBig sips
[3:05:37] <+hoenhime344> H20....not H02
[3:05:39] <%templar010> The change begins
[3:05:47] <leargo> the conspiracys
[3:05:57] <%RioGascar> Now with lovecraft is it viewing them with your eyes that brings madness OR can you watch a video or recording of it and be fine?
[3:05:57] <%Aerkk> Soon, what we know as Pat will be gone... he will be replaced with mostly water.
[3:06:00] <Dementedpenguin> Look at that IT house.
[3:06:05] <%Artimadare> it's a fixer-upper
[3:06:07] <+LeonPup> Pat look for the hobo signs so you don't have to try each door
[3:06:10] <%Aerkk> House Flipper DLC
[3:06:13] <+Schrodingers_Box> Sharknado
[3:06:13] <natebud> completely unrelated hobo house
[3:06:26] <natebud> did he just bump into jerry seinfeld?
[3:06:31] <+palebluedots> I Thought this game comes out in 2020 @AngriestPat
[3:06:37] <+hoenhime344> just a grown man parkuring over waist high fences
[3:06:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @riogascar Pretty much any depiction is a hazard
[3:06:46] <+AXL808> @Aerkk that means he will be one step closer to the fishy old great ones
[3:06:56] <%bread_assassin> Also, why did that house have a deck, but no back door?
[3:07:02] <InugamiTheHound> the handle was shining and that's why you can tell what you can interact with
[3:07:03] <Bogart4321> nice house tbh
[3:07:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> At least to some extent
[3:07:08] <%RioGascar> I find it odd that a lot of lovecraft takes place in 1920’s. A modern lovecraft could be interesting in that it uses modern tech and even has a massive dilemma. like say someone uploads a lovecraft monster onto to Twitter and it goes trending
[3:07:09] <ZazzyDoesStuff> yellow. yellow everywhere.
[3:07:13] <natebud> be a shame if someone looted it
[3:07:37] <captainnathaniel> i smell puzzle
[3:07:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> This deal gets worse all the time
[3:07:45] <%RioGascar> So even a drawing would be hazardous? Or a low resolution photo?
[3:07:46] <Doodle_Taco> @riogascar There is a Call of Cthullu mod that is about this
[3:07:48] <+SuperiorDelta> I'm seeing a lot of yellow in this house
[3:08:03] <+bubblebasspickles> eligable bachelor OwO
[3:08:06] <+Estuko> take a ump on his table
[3:08:07] <%MattDemers> Front page news!

[3:08:43] <%MonsieurHedge> nice
[3:08:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I think the monkey dude is an escort. He took an ad out in the paper to announce being single
[3:08:48] <+Estuko> it's a fucking PARTY in here
[3:08:49] <%Roasted_Pheasant> There's some schlormpy boys here.
[3:08:51] <natebud> lit fire, someone's been here recently... or eurojank
[3:08:51] <%Artimadare> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[3:08:53] <%MonsieurHedge> good noises
[3:08:54] <+AXL808> sopping bullshit upstairs
[3:08:55] <%MattDemers> Oh god fuck this game
[3:08:55] <Dementedpenguin> oh god.... of course there's a basement....
[3:09:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Shoot the madness away
[3:09:06] <LegatusLeone> That gun... it sounds so weird!
[3:09:07] <%Aerkk> They were all just having a cool house party
[3:09:12] <rytisone> cap those fools
[3:09:15] <+hoenhime344> watch him be insane and they are real people
[3:09:19] <mrvidicus> Come join the Cthulhu Cult! It's fine, really! You get to turn into literal cancer, it'll be fun!
[3:09:19] <garbageheaphound> fuck all of that
[3:09:19] <haisho> GUN. Sanity Maker.
[3:09:22] <%RioGascar> Did that thing, just shoot brains at you
[3:09:24] <42nfl19> Don't worry, @AngriestPat has the power of God and Anime on his side!
[3:09:24] <captainnathaniel> holy shit, this house is infested
[3:09:25] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Very very schlormpy
[3:09:29] <%MonsieurHedge> they look like MONSTERS to you?
[3:09:30] <natebud> they look like cthulus to you?
[3:09:33] <limeyprick> nice awkward reload
[3:09:38] <Dovakhin573> Well i hope those things I just shot were actual monsters and not real people
[3:09:44] <Doodle_Taco> @natebud Beat me to it
[3:09:44] <%PinkSuprende> I like that hobos have been IN HERE and marked up that crate
[3:09:49] <2Kidkinobi2> SHOOT THE MOTHERFUCKERS

[3:10:14] <Jack_of_No_Trades> weird comment
[3:10:21] <%salty_syd913> ???
[3:10:22] <+Estuko> lmfao why did he say that
[3:10:26] <+Estuko> "You fucking like that painting don't you"
[3:10:43] <Invisoguy> HOLY SHIT. I think i just placed it, is this MC Voice actor the same MC voice actor for The Long Dark??
[3:10:43] <captainnathaniel> he has a portrait of himself, he is making a joke about it
[3:10:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that painting's a slut
[3:10:51] <%gigglefists> take a pic of the body
[3:10:54] <+hoenhime344> sloot*
[3:10:59] <+Shaggnar> Well that's plain to see
[3:11:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> innsmouthers called him an ape
[3:11:02] <+TridentBerryBurst> I mean, it is pretty obvious
[3:11:05] <+AXL808> hard not to notice the ape-ness
[3:11:08] <Doodle_Taco> @sphincter_spelunker Thanks, it was confusing
[3:11:09] <Bogart4321> do you have melee attacks pat?
[3:11:13] <%RioGascar> can you view cuthulu through a mirror or nah you big fucked
[3:11:16] <tanarath> Such prejudice against winston's uncle.
[3:11:17] <Bogart4321> just in case you run out of bullets?
[3:11:17] <%Aerkk> It was The Mirror of Galadriel and the apeman wants it to give it to tiny ape-men with furry feet.
[3:11:22] <%Gray_skies1993> @RioGascar big fucked
[3:11:23] <%juxtest> Shoot him a couple times just to be sure
[3:11:24] <natebud> voodoo running from my magic

[3:11:26] <%foreverN2dust> nice erotica
[3:11:27] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat I think it was just a dig at his appearence. Like how I might call you a gaming Leprechaun.
[3:11:28] <%gigglefists> eh worth a shot
[3:11:28] <ミュウレ4242> Bogart4321, he can hit thingss w/ a shovel.
[3:11:43] <+hoenhime344> thats cool

[3:12:22] <captainnathaniel> I only see heresy up on this bitch
[3:12:23] <+RenoDeGeneric> This dude has the stone mask, 100%
[3:12:26] <+hoenhime344> its strong euro jank
[3:12:26] <%RioGascar> Is the ark of the covenant a love craft horror? At least going by Indiana jones and raiders of lost arks depiction
[3:12:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> @riogascar There are no loopholes. The more information you obtain, the worse off you are.
[3:12:49] <%juxtest> Nice
[3:12:56] <TheMorilo> Oh my god that exact statue model is in sherlock holme
[3:13:04] <tanarath> Pat, make boolit.
[3:13:09] <alexandrecau> shovel time
[3:13:12] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Okay, I think I see how it is now. The pistol runs the .38 Auto, revolver is a .44-40 model. Kay.
[3:13:19] <%Artimadare> magic-vision?
[3:13:25] <natebud> now shoot the revolver to pick up those bullets

[3:17:13] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat So I might have missed it but does the MC recognize that he gained weird batman vision powers or does he never acknowledges it?
[3:17:19] <beetbo2> @tennochief but can big ink take on strong terry
[3:17:25] <captainnathaniel> police archives?
[3:17:28] <natebud> Excuse me sir, i'm looking for the most irish man.
[3:17:32] <haisho> @42nfl19 He knows. It's why he became a detective in the first place.
[3:17:43] <%mister___doctor> mister___doctor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hey Pat. It's been a minute. Ever think about how Sticky Fingers is perfect for stealing wallets?
[3:17:45] <42nfl19> So he gained it BEFORE coming here, weird
[3:17:48] <Thalchampz> I KNOW RIGHT
[3:17:50] <%castarts> PogChamp
[3:17:51] <nerdblase> Batman powers? That's just crazy.
[3:17:51] <mrvidicus> I've gotten that exact same vibe watching this.

[3:17:56] <haisho> ah yes Evil Within 2
[3:17:57] <laguerrilha> Because EW2 plays better?
[3:17:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> then you'll play evil within for a few minutes and drop it
[3:17:58] <Bogart4321> i just beat it a day ago
[3:18:00] <%ColonelRozum> yeeeea Evil Within 1 and 2 are great
[3:18:00] <Thalchampz> evil within 2 is REALLY good
[3:18:03] <haisho> when Crazy Talk struck HARD
[3:18:06] <redial_nick> yeah 2 is the one that pops
[3:18:06] <%luftraumm1> 2 is pretty good
[3:18:07] <natebud> This game makes me want to play Pathologic
[3:18:07] <chronoxgp> ew1 has more gore in the headshots
[3:18:10] <42nfl19> But pat, there is also evil within too!
[3:18:14] <Ranger747> excited for Ghostwire
[3:18:14] <%ColonelRozum> i love both of them
[3:18:16] <InugamiTheHound> remember how dumb and evil the main badguys were in that game?
[3:18:17] <%GarbageNirvana> It's ~spooky~
[3:18:18] <Tennochief> @beetbo2 probably
[3:18:26] <+r_Foeburden87> Tiiiime

[3:18:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @garbagenirvana She is a delight
[3:18:39] <Ranger747> ye
[3:18:40] <+AXL808> Pat saying that makes me remember when he got electrocuted in Evil Within
[3:18:50] <chronoxgp> the e3 lady designed the monsters
[3:19:05] <QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> That guy is NOT 21
[3:19:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's a rough 21

[3:19:23] <chronoxgp> lollygagging
[3:19:23] <%Gray_skies1993> the guy in the picture is in his 40's guys

[3:19:33] <%Aerkk> I have a free t-shirt for Murdered: Soul Suspect, the bad game Sony made. This game is about equal jank but feels much more... sincere? They're clearly trying to make a good game here.
[3:19:37] <%tweedler92> That's a tweaker's 21
[3:19:41] <%UncleAWOL> dodging jury duty is a big deal
[3:19:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> nah, there's two pictures Kappa
[3:19:48] <captainnathaniel> lollygagging? careful pat, he is the Dragonborn!
[3:19:49] <SilverJakler> @AngriestPat Would you be down for possibly streaming any of the main PS2 platformers (Ratchet, Sly or Jak)?
[3:19:49] <%RioGascar> An idea i hope they go for at some point, what if they use a person who saw lovecraft shit and put them in the machine and try and use their brains madness to try and create their own cuthulia thing? Sorta like how dead space 2 used isaac crazyiness to build a marker
[3:19:56] <$Jungos60> The pic is from Squint, the 46 year old dude

[3:21:20] <graemecrackers1> FF7 is trash
[3:21:27] <Jack_of_No_Trades> It will be my first time seeing it
[3:21:34] <%foreverN2dust> @graemecrackers1 snowso1Ban
[3:21:35] <+Intolerable> Final Fantasy 7? Is that one of those Indie games?

[3:21:43] <RealThiele> oops, all edges
[3:21:43] <%ColonelRozum> @Jack_of_No_Trades yea shes a concept artist worked on a bunch of awesome games, she also worked lead design on evil within 1 and 2 and is a apprentice director to shinji
[3:21:46] <%aishman> Also I'm so closed to beating Judgement, 54 hours in. Fuck.
[3:21:49] <+AXL808> and it's working
[3:21:49] <@commanderclaw> It's not trash, but it's kinda weird to go back to
[3:21:52] <$notEisiger> FF7 is trash in the same way Taco Bell is trash. That could be good thing.
[3:21:52] <rytisone> play crisis core
[3:21:53] <Jolly_Adventurer> Ban that edgy guy
[3:21:54] <%templar010> it gun be gud
[3:21:55] <MoonObscure> ban da bitch
[3:21:56] <+KoyaMusa> and then realize that it's okay
[3:21:56] <+HyraFukit> The same people who think older rpgs are trash are the same people who think MGS3 is the best.
[3:21:56] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Let's Mosey
[3:21:57] <natebud> I just started playing it. Got up to disc 3
[3:21:57] <%aishman> I really wanna go back and play the last/new Prey
[3:21:57] <Zombrocom> Me
[3:21:58] <%Aerkk> I hear FF7 has got tons of polygons looking forward to its graphical glory
[3:21:58] <beetbo2> Last legend 7?
[3:21:58] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I need to do some stuff in MHW to do some prep work for Iceborne, though I have forever due to PC player
[3:22:00] <$SirTerribleh> Hi everyone
[3:22:00] <%UncleAWOL> well, I've never played it OR seen it
[3:22:01] <worldbrand> there is so much more than I remembered
[3:22:02] <Tennochief> It is deceptively long, like really LONG
[3:22:03] <chronoxgp> i like the first disc of ff7
[3:22:05] <%gigglefists> never played 7. 9 is my fav tho
[3:22:05] <%tweedler92> I just played it through for the first time!
[3:22:06] <%ColonelRozum> @Jack_of_No_Trades sorry for the late reply
[3:22:09] <Madbearv> I've never played 7, I was a N64 kid
[3:22:09] <MaeMae94> @AngriestPat my only FF game has been 14, how does the story of 7 compare?
[3:22:12] <%MonsieurHedge> i want to see if tifa's honkers are REALLY that big
[3:22:12] <+Intolerable> It's jank, but good jank
[3:22:14] <wicketpelican> Ff 6 is better
[3:22:18] <InugamiTheHound> wow a lot salty ff6 fans hating on ff7 LOL
[3:22:19] <%castarts> FF6 Kappa
[3:22:21] <%SWFanatic> But it has chocobo racing. Spend 100 hours to get this 10 minute summon
[3:22:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell yeah, FF6
[3:22:25] <%mistspade> @AngriestPat we gonna grind to kill the weapons?
[3:22:26] <Sitromxe> FF7's story is nonsense.
[3:22:28] <%Faustgesicht> Actually voiced in Rufus in one of the many abridged FF7s
[3:22:30] <%RioGascar> i’ve got it on plate to play. But first i need to finish 14...or well catchup to 14
[3:22:34] <%miamimackjr> are you gonna do a one off of it, or till completion?
[3:22:34] <captainnathaniel> knock knock motherfuckers!
[3:22:36] <+KoyaMusa> yeah ff6 is better
[3:22:36] <SilverJakler> @Sphincter_Spelunker I meant more the main trio
[3:22:36] <natebud> He's got a big house
[3:22:38] <%dalmek> @angriestpat "Huge Earthbound fan excited to play it for the first time"
[3:22:38] <$notEisiger> How can you have a trashy final fantasy if you can't see Tifa's honkers wiggle while some fat fuck is thrusting his dick at her
[3:22:41] <laguerrilha> FF 9 is my fav too. 9>6>7
[3:22:43] <%Dr_DangerPhD> FF9 is prob my fav of the series but FF7 is pretty good, long as hell game though
[3:22:44] <2Kidkinobi2> SHOOT THE MOTHERFUCKERS
[3:22:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The flippin remake announcement was over 4 years ago NotLikeThis People have started and completed school in that time
[3:22:48] <Bogart4321> i like the heat wave coming out of the gun
[3:22:51] <SilverJakler> Plus I think TY and Tak are multiplatform
[3:22:51] <RealThiele> 7 story is similar to ARR in quality, only 7 did it first
[3:23:00] <%koriedacoward> thats a lovecraft
[3:23:02] <ミュウレ4242> you'll be suprised to find that ff7 has a story, and that the main character, cloud strife, is remotely likable.
[3:23:11] <wicketpelican> Ff 6 is the best story after Tactics
[3:23:12] <haisho> bitches don't know how to High Shovel
[3:23:15] <%arcaderabbit48> They're honestly kinda cute
[3:23:16] <@commanderclaw> And you thought wall centipedes were bad
[3:23:18] <%Kahnicus> Oh man it's those Tzimisce fleshcrafted things from VTMB
[3:23:19] <%MonsieurHedge> but what about the HONKERS
[3:23:19] <+ArcLifth> bullets?
[3:23:20] <+darkflight55> Is that Cthulu face hugger?
[3:23:22] <%Aerkk> I like the Open Layout here, with the bathroom connected to the dining room
[3:23:24] <+Intolerable> Just pistol whip the cthulu monsters
[3:23:29] <QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> WutFace
[3:23:32] <Tennochief> EW
[3:23:33] <%Aerkk> They use bullets as money what
[3:23:34] <Kalinflip> likable characters in final fantasy huh?
[3:23:34] <+AXL808> does anyone know what Pat plays ff14 on PS4, PC (non-steam), or PC (Steam)?
[3:23:39] <graemecrackers1> is that a H.P Lovecraft design or someone elses
[3:23:40] <eldritchart> cat crab
[3:23:45] <SilverJakler> Good ole roasted lovercraftian
[3:23:47] <SilverJakler> my fav
[3:23:56] <Doodle_Taco> TehePelo
[3:23:57] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay yeah, eating a cthulhu spawn is probably not good for your physical mental, or spiritual wellbeing
[3:23:58] <Tennochief> @graemecrackers1 everything in this game is Lovecraft
[3:24:03] <%Hilleltaco> It wasn't even cut up, just the whole thing on a plate
[3:24:03] <%UncleAWOL> should I play ff7, or will stream be a decent stand-in if I just want to see it before remake
[3:24:04] <natebud> Alternate currency aside, why would a morgue need bullets?
[3:24:04] <+Grayhammatter> and got stabbed
[3:24:10] <Deekman> @angriestpat is it a French thing to pronounce Hearth like earth not Like heart?
[3:24:13] <InugamiTheHound> so the murder became murdered??
[3:24:17] <beetbo2> The plot thickens
[3:24:18] <RealThiele> the dunkirk stabber
[3:24:19] <Moonlight_Grimoire> killed in the same way, how... curious
[3:24:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SilverJakler oh, right, trio. I forgot about 2003's Acclaim's Vexx. How silly of me
[3:24:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> @arcaderabbit48 Probably gives you tapeworms, in your soul
[3:24:24] <graemecrackers1> but like is it designed creature wise by Lovecraft himself ?
[3:24:24] <%Kahnicus> Is there some kinda dagger cult of fish people? Holy shit.
[3:24:25] <laguerrilha> @commanderclaw I prefer those monsters than house centipedes
[3:24:33] <lammasurex> I'm waiting for this to come out on Game pass
[3:24:38] <%MonsieurHedge> @Deekman what the fuck no thats just how its supposed to be pronounced
[3:24:40] <haisho> WHO

[3:24:55] <+Intolerable> APE LOVER
[3:24:55] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @ColonelRozum That is so cool, I hadn't heard her work details before. I am excited for her next game and impressed with what she has already done.
[3:24:57] <mrvidicus> Who is fucking monkeys now?
[3:24:57] <natebud> was that a ghost chicken?
[3:24:58] <RealThiele> raccoon face humped him
[3:25:01] <graemecrackers1> he forgot too order McDonald's
[3:25:04] <eldritch_kev15> fucking APE LOVERS
[3:25:04] <+Estuko> It's that grandma assassin from that one game
[3:25:04] <SilverJakler> Knives have memories now
[3:25:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> grandma stabbins, the scourge of the lower east end
[3:25:20] <captainnathaniel> bet he wishes he had put his mother on the asylum now
[3:25:20] <%SWFanatic> @UncleAWOL If you want to play it yourself go ahead. But I'd think just watching a LP would be enough for now. It was a PS1 game. Sharp polygons.
[3:25:22] <CalderGaming> "I'm disabled! Knife disabled!"

[3:25:51] <%falineth> just stare at the wall
[3:25:51] <%Aerkk> Try walking into it while using the vision ?
[3:25:52] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @ColonelRozum No worries at all, I am extremely slow at this. Chat conversations are pretty new to me.

[3:26:11] <%SWFanatic> the wall was sobbing
[3:26:11] <+niknikmcsneakerton> hows this game look?
[3:26:13] <mrvidicus> With a Level 4 Light Sword, you can just hit the crack in the wall to break it, Link!
[3:26:13] <+AXL808> i get the cthulu shit going on but what's with the birds?
[3:26:14] <mield916> look at the symbol

[3:26:22] <haisho> fucking hell Chthulhu-vision stop being cryptic as hell
[3:26:25] <+Foxfire710> look at the symbol up close
[3:26:30] <tanarath> Is Pat not understanding what Baba is?
[3:26:30] <%Hilleltaco> I think you just gotta look at it, you misunderstood the first time it happened because you hit it while it was opening
[3:26:30] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> So has Pat sucked Chuthulu's dick yet?
[3:26:32] <mrvidicus> wait what just happened
[3:26:33] <%Kahnicus> Odin trying to figure out what Cthulhu'd up to.

[3:27:32] <$notEisiger> or was it Hugh Laurie
[3:27:34] <%arcaderabbit48> I appreciate that our detective is totally willing to admit to magic existing. That's usually a serious sticking point with these stories
[3:27:44] <%Aerkk> Hocus Pocus, so it was done by Bette Midler
[3:27:46] <%Gray_skies1993> @arcaderabbit48 agreed
[3:27:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "she"
[3:27:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> sure bud

[3:28:34] <natebud> who the hell is kay
[3:28:36] <$rdark_ksu> So I know Kay means god but have they explained that any more?
[3:28:37] <RealThiele> 21 in smoker years
[3:28:39] <Tennochief> take his shit and rat him out anyways
[3:28:40] <mitzieter> is 'K' cthulu or something else?
[3:28:42] <+BubbaRands> Every kiss begins with...
[3:28:43] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Manslaughter.
[3:28:51] <%foreverN2dust> @Aerkk "philosophy club"
[3:28:53] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @AngriestPat Pat loves snitching
[3:28:58] <alexandrecau> You'll do the same if you were on the ropes Pat
[3:29:00] <Doodle_Taco> But he did it for his Mama...
[3:29:05] <DKDiamantes> HE'S GONNA GET THE CHAR FOR THIS
[3:29:07] <corepool> mash x to snitch
[3:29:08] <%Kahnicus> And now detecto becomes murderer!
[3:29:08] <+BuriasDempsey> you murdered a man, you deserve the chair
[3:29:09] <Jack_of_No_Trades> 2nd degree
[3:29:09] <worldbrand> I did it for my MAMA
[3:29:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I was literally typing bullshit manslaughter
[3:29:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Manslaughter at BEST
[3:29:12] <natebud> but geez pat it was just an accident.
[3:29:12] <Tennochief> Hey DK is here
[3:29:12] <+Sulfur_Boride> Is that Xander Mobus as the detective?
[3:29:15] <RealThiele> literal man slaughter
[3:29:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> damn it
[3:29:21] <+Grayhammatter> gonna get the CHAR
[3:29:29] <%MagickBurritoh> 2nd degree murder
[3:29:31] <%Aerkk> It was done during a home invasion and burglary so its automatically 1st degree murder in most places.
[3:29:32] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Doby did mean to kill, only maim or seriously injure.
[3:29:32] <+JackMillerTime> was it in self defense?
[3:29:35] <natebud> he didn't mean to stab him 21 times
[3:29:37] <lammasurex> You saw Once Upon a Time in Hollywood too?
[3:29:38] <mitzieter> maybe it's man slaughter in 1940's terms
[3:29:39] <+BubbaRands> You're goin to jail
[3:29:42] <$SirTerribleh> Those Doritos? You some sort of Gremlin now?
[3:29:44] <%Kahnicus> Yeah but have you ever tried to cut through a sternum? It takes doing.
[3:29:48] <%MagickBurritoh> he shot like 4 times didn't he?
[3:29:54] <%SWFanatic> apatGoblin
[3:29:59] <+AXL808> "You murdered a man in his own home, but it was an oopsie daisy and you said sorry so I guess I'll let you go"
[3:29:59] <tanarath> Pat, you know how most PIs go to college and take criminal justice classes?
[3:30:03] <%Dr_DangerPhD> murder in the first bois, you could argue it was premeditated because he brought the knife with him
[3:30:07] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Still a crime regardless.
[3:30:16] <worldbrand> so uh... you tell him he's going to jail and then leave him there huh
[3:30:19] <RealThiele> bake em' away toys
[3:30:25] <%RioGascar> I believe murder of the home owner or home occupants in a home invasion is automatic murder one
[3:30:34] <+BubbaRands> Most not ALLL
[3:30:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> yeah
[3:30:49] <worldbrand> it cursed your CPU cooler
[3:30:50] <captainnathaniel> @worldbrand he can't really flee from this town
[3:30:50] <+Intolerable> Pat's slaughtering those Doritos
[3:30:51] <haisho> maybe the jank fried your cooling
[3:30:53] <%UncleAWOL> cthulhu cursed your PC
[3:30:58] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Technical showcases like this can do that
[3:31:01] <%ElenaManetta> Have you noticed games about evil tend to crash your PC and console?
[3:31:02] <eldritchart> is the ff7 going to be the remake, is that even out yet?
[3:31:13] <%Kahnicus> Oh man, that mannequin run.
[3:31:18] <InugamiTheHound> remember that android that stabbed a man 21 times in Detroit become human
[3:31:23] <%UncleAWOL> remake isn't out yet
[3:31:23] <%arcaderabbit48> Popped open the computer and found all this weird fish slime gumming up the fan and cooler. Was really weird!
[3:31:23] <Badgerconda_> You say all this like normal human laws matter to these weird fucking citizens of CTHULHUVILLE.
[3:31:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Texas yeah death in a felony is treated as murder
[3:31:26] <+AXL808> Your PC couldn't handle the madness
[3:31:28] <KingVantq> @eldritchart original
[3:31:28] <Tennochief> 21 TIMES
[3:31:30] <SilverJakler> I"ll rob your shit, bitch
[3:31:33] <+BubbaRands> Just yell self defense
[3:31:34] <tanarath> It's why burglars don't carry weapons.
[3:31:36] <SilverJakler> rob it good
[3:31:38] <+Grayhammatter> but i only stabbed him!
[3:31:39] <mrvidicus> @InugamiTheHound Gonna be real, I barely remember anything about Detroit: Beyond Human
[3:31:42] <RealThiele> fell on it 21 times
[3:31:49] <Tennochief> *TABLE SLAM*
[3:31:54] <alexandrecau> And you brought the knife
[3:32:01] <%Artimadare> why does this man never sit
[3:32:01] <%SWFanatic> heya throbbo
[3:32:03] <+BubbaRands> whoever yells self defense first wins.
[3:32:07] <Jathspuh> On this special episode of Clone High tpYGOcreepy
[3:32:07] <%nyghtmare42> And no castle doctrine in Massachusetts either
[3:32:08] <%Aerkk> Which is why most places define 'weapon' as nearly anything - the crowbar becomes a deadly club etc.
[3:32:10] <%UncleAWOL> GOOD burglars don't carry weapons. Drug people looking to make money do
[3:32:12] <Blank9> serial self defense
[3:32:17] <mitzieter> i think it's manslaughter because he wasn't going into the house intending to kill anoyne he only did it to stop himself from dying @AngriestPat
[3:32:20] <%Kahnicus> The fuck? Why is Gorilla Grod in this game?
[3:32:23] <+niknikmcsneakerton> how does this game look?
[3:32:26] <mrvidicus> I was going to say that David Cage needs to make a Cthulhu game. Then I fucking remembered.
[3:32:28] <TastySammiches> carrying a weapon as a burglar sounds like the worst idea
[3:32:29] <$rdark_ksu> oh come on "squid pro quo" was right there and they didn't do the pun?
[3:32:30] <InugamiTheHound> @mrvidicus oh god the force plot twitch with kid was so bad and mad me hate that game
[3:32:31] <%arcaderabbit48> @Artimadare His bones are too fucked up. Notice how his posture is always super stiff? Inbreed bones
[3:32:35] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> WTF IS THAT?!
[3:32:41] <Tennochief> monkey man
[3:32:42] <%MattDemers> Monkey Man would be voiced by Tony Jay if he was still alive
[3:32:46] <alexandrecau> @UncleAWOL that guy was paid to burglarized, hardly a drugged guy
[3:32:53] <Tennochief> the fish people are worse
[3:32:54] <ZazzyDoesStuff> reporting
[3:33:00] <%UncleAWOL> Yes, which is why he's a bad burglar
[3:33:01] <%foreverN2dust> @AmaniIsYourBoss a man of "robust" lineage
[3:33:06] <+SuperiorDelta> But in some places, you can also get in trouble for killing or harming an intruder
[3:33:07] <%ColonelRozum> yeeea woop his ass
[3:33:08] <+NobuuNobuu> so is the ape man some kind of a monster or just a norrmal human?
[3:33:08] <+Intolerable> Pat, you snitch
[3:33:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> should have told the police
[3:33:10] <TastySammiches> don't be racist against the fish people
[3:33:13] <%Niney_Who> Pat the snitch
[3:33:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @arcaderabbit48 He is a literal ape-human hybrid
[3:33:17] <%Kahnicus> holed misspelled as hold
[3:33:17] <+AXL808> gimme muh money
[3:33:19] <+BubbaRands> gib money
[3:33:20] <Tennochief> Fish people deserve racism
[3:33:22] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Yeesh, that's some fucking lineage
[3:33:29] <%Aerkk> @NobuuNobuu This game is about the eternal struggle of Fishmen vs Apemen

[3:33:32] <Jack_of_No_Trades> snitch for cash is private eye MO
[3:33:33] <%Artimadare> apatGib
[3:33:33] <captainnathaniel> that... doesn't sound like law enforcement
[3:33:33] <%SWFanatic> aren't humans already ape hybrids
[3:33:34] <SilverJakler> MC's eyes are super droopy
[3:33:38] <SilverJakler> like geez
[3:33:38] <zettig> !uptime
[3:33:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 33m.
[3:33:42] <+AXL808> he's tired
[3:33:43] <%arcaderabbit48> @GeneralSCPatton Its a miracle his posture is as good as it is!
[3:33:43] <$Kenzo2000> Uncle Andross!
[3:33:50] <+BuriasDempsey> so do can you take sides in this family feud or can only really work for the ape looking guy?
[3:33:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @nobuunobuu Someone literally fucked an ape somewhere in his family tree
[3:33:59] <mrvidicus> Who is Kay.
[3:34:01] <+jjhoho> his eyes are the correct amount of droopy for his character tbh, for all the things this game fucks up i really like his characterization
[3:34:03] <%Aerkk> Whoa my mind palace just had a new wing constructed: Innsmouthians/Cthulians/Fish People are just Reverse Mermaids.
[3:34:05] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> I didn't know Donkey Kong was apart of the Old God lore
[3:34:06] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Magilla Gorilla looking more like Manila Gorilla
[3:34:08] <SilverJakler> I'd assume messing with cthulu shit would do that to ya
[3:34:12] <%Gray_skies1993> @mrvidicus Kay is the name of the local "God"
[3:34:13] <+jjhoho> @mrvidicus unclear at this point i think?
[3:34:14] <%puhff> Hey Pat, what brand of baby wipes do you use to clean your controller?
[3:34:24] <Tennochief> I bet it was the fishpeople
[3:34:27] <%UncleAWOL> Game Baby Wipers
[3:34:30] <thattallguy47> Al da KONG il al di DONKY
[3:34:31] <natebud> What about kids of enemies.
[3:34:34] <TastySammiches> ooh nice stutter/hitch
[3:34:37] <%Artimadare> "this doesn't spark joy"
[3:34:38] <%MelBrooksKA> Massachusetts seems to have a felony murder clause
[3:34:39] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat wouldn't your guy get fed up with being paid in bullet by that point, like gonna amount to jack shit when he goes back to the city
[3:34:40] <%SWFanatic> Gamers Rise Up brand baby wipes
[3:34:45] <Doodle_Taco> He is so m a d
[3:34:49] <captainnathaniel> his father must be full on tax evasion
[3:34:49] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat aren't shells money?
[3:34:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> and TRAPS
[3:34:50] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Spooky
[3:34:52] <Ner234> WHY don't you have shotgun?
[3:34:54] <Blank9> throw the shells
[3:34:54] <EuropantLamprey> Just use those a money
[3:34:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Yay! Rifle through all of his father's possession! Find the good scotch!
[3:34:54] <chronoxgp> i thought you got one undewater?
[3:34:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> guess you'll need em later
[3:34:56] <%MagickBurritoh> F O R E S H A D O W
[3:34:59] <mield916> complete the main quests to get it.
[3:35:00] <InugamiTheHound> Geoff from achievement hunter had a shotgun
[3:35:00] <alexandrecau> especially ammo for that doesn't fit your gun
[3:35:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat did you level up off screen?
[3:35:01] <%NWR_James> throw them at him
[3:35:03] <ne0bunny> is there a gun store?
[3:35:04] <TastySammiches> what kind of detective gets paid in bullets
[3:35:07] <%Niney_Who> oof
[3:35:07] <+bubblebasspickles> just get one at walmart duh
[3:35:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @angriestpat be sure to remind Paige that August 3rd is International Mustard Day
[3:35:11] <+KoyaMusa> oh, BIG give up
[3:35:12] <mayorrev> F
[3:35:12] <tanarath> Not coming back to the Sinking City?
[3:35:12] <mitzieter> hit the shells with the back of a hammer
[3:35:13] <%Kahnicus> But you WILL have a shotgun. Unless you neglect to swap it with the broken one
[3:35:14] <IronGlorfindel> aww
[3:35:14] <+Foxfire710> you need to progress the story to get better weapons
[3:35:15] <%puhff> :'(
[3:35:15] <worldbrand> There are shotgun shells here... they've already hatched
[3:35:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> WE WANT MORE!
[3:35:18] <thattallguy47> bye
[3:35:19] <mrvidicus> Yeahhhh, this is one of those games where the first 3 hours are the best.
[3:35:21] <tanarath> Fair.

[3:35:25] <%Artimadare> ;_;
[3:35:25] <%Arxel1> hello
[3:35:27] <%tweedler92> F
[3:35:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Unfortunate, but alright
[3:35:28] <%ElenaManetta> Sinking City's gameplay is not as interesting
[3:35:28] <%salty_syd913> thats fair
[3:35:29] <corepool> hell yeah outer wilds
[3:35:30] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Thank you for showing what you did of it. It was a fun time
[3:35:30] <%Aerkk> Outer Wilds is very good but it won't take super long
[3:35:33] <Pixel_gee> Outer Wilds is a total Pog
[3:35:33] <+RenoDeGeneric> Damn, atpToiler
[3:35:34] <$raziel391> yaaaaaaaaaaaaay
[3:35:34] <%ElenaManetta> If it moved faster for us to digest the story though
[3:35:35] <%waltzqueen> F
[3:35:36] <$raziel391> DS2
[3:35:36] <Tennochief> yay
[3:35:37] <ZazzyDoesStuff> weeew!!
[3:35:38] <alexandrecau> @TastySammiches the city being flooded sent them back to metro currency so he gets paid in bullets
[3:35:40] <%galaxyswirl> YOOOOOOO
[3:35:42] <+BubbaRands> nope never
[3:35:42] <%UncleAWOL> oh shit dark souls 2 ???

[3:36:10] <TastySammiches> from what I've heard the first few hours of sinking city are the peak anyway
[3:36:10] <%Bt_Robot> Is Peach playing SotFS
[3:36:12] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Here we go again
[3:36:15] <Tennochief> oh boy
[3:36:16] <%UncleAWOL> Do you have a "drop your shield" poster ready
[3:36:22] <+KoyaMusa> it's been a while since pat's given up hard on a game, nice to know he's still got it
[3:36:25] <haisho> I have no idea how that is related to Dark Souls 2
[3:36:29] <chronoxgp> rough i was enjoying that lp
[3:36:35] <Blank9> peach is not going to use a shield
[3:36:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> not blonde...
[3:36:36] <%Mrbaconator> i have never heard of it it sounds obscure

[3:36:48] <%brickwall35> God awful hints Pat

[3:36:50] <%trips___> trips___ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Sup! 3 months for the Elmo! Also, Pat is ok too, I guess.
[3:36:52] <%nyghtmare42> And Jon from Garfield?
[3:36:52] <haisho> that's just stretching it
[3:36:54] <+AXL808> what about the trumpet?
[3:36:54] <%NWR_James> Pat going too far
[3:36:57] <Snookasaurus> so awful
[3:37:01] <Mythundare> *sees a ladder* is that a dark souls reference?
[3:37:01] <%puhff> I still think you're lying and you're actually gonna play Garfield Racing
[3:37:04] <%Aerkk> There is a talking cat in DS2?
[3:37:06] <%TheSniperJoe> No, shame on you pat, shaaaame.
[3:37:07] <%SWFanatic> i like the majula music
[3:37:09] <sakeydo> ??????????????
[3:37:09] <%Bt_Robot> Is she playing Scholar or Vanilla?
[3:37:13] <%brickwall35> that's true I'll take that
[3:37:15] <Jaller101514> horn?
[3:37:15] <EuropantLamprey> To be honest, the Ladder made me think Dark Souls 2, but the next hints through me off
[3:37:15] <haisho> ...was there EVEN a talking cat in DS2?
[3:37:17] <+UmoLoco> @mythundare 😂
[3:37:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Aerkk shalquior or whatever the spelling
[3:37:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Welp
[3:37:24] <mrvidicus> Alright, but Pat, I seriously have a question on behalf of EVERYONE here that you have to answer before you go: What the FUCK do you mean NO DOORKNOBS?!
[3:37:24] <+r_Foeburden87> Ruby sea and theres a dungeon
[3:37:28] <haisho> ah right fluffy
[3:37:29] <%Gray_skies1993> @haisho yeah there is
[3:37:29] <%UncleAWOL> There is a talking cat in DS2 yes
[3:37:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> in the house in Majula
[3:37:33] <SilverJakler> So what did those images mean? The trumpet, feather and emerald?
[3:37:35] <%Arxel1> Of course there was a talking cat in DS2
[3:37:37] <+Grayhammatter> there's a dungeon
[3:37:40] <%waltzqueen> @AngriestPat Thanks to you DS2 was my first DS and i'll always love Majula. Thanks
[3:37:43] <%Mrbaconator> talking cat is the only plausible clue you have
[3:37:46] <SilverJakler> What do they have to do with DS2 I mean?
[3:37:48] <haisho> I was thinking of the chonky DS cats
[3:37:51] <ZazzyDoesStuff> DS2 falls apart when you do a minimum bonfires run.
[3:37:55] <worldbrand> Those were like La-Mulana tiers of hints. Like, "oh there was a tablet that shows up if you wait for 30 seconds in this spot that tells you how to do this"
[3:37:56] <chronoxgp> dark souls 2 is actually demon souls for the first half
[3:38:00] <rytisone> 720 30
[3:38:02] <TastySammiches> depends on the game and the size of your screen
[3:38:08] <%Mrbaconator> pat why didn't you give her a picture of a random dude there are people in dark souls 2 also
[3:38:09] <%trips___> 4k 120hz pls.
[3:38:11] <+Grayhammatter> you are
[3:38:12] <%Mrbaconator> very strong hint
[3:38:16] <InugamiTheHound> we remember the dragon age stream with "hold on"
[3:38:20] <TastySammiches> if you're on a TV, 4k 60fps is better
[3:38:23] <%Aerkk> Buy one of those $6,000 Nvdia gaming 70" gaming TVs Pat
[3:38:35] <ArmoredViking> I am so happy to catch your stream @AngriestPat thank you for an awesome night
[3:38:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @InugamiTheHound there was a line. but chat couldn't see it. pat did tho
[3:38:45] <%RupanSen> 120hz+ are really evident on FPS
[3:38:51] <%FoulNightingale> You're nuts. 2K 144hz
[3:39:04] <chronoxgp> sony 50" 4k non hdr
[3:39:09] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:39:10] <haisho> I once played a tank, missed a bunch of mobs and let the healer die. I feel terrible.
[3:39:15] <Tennochief> LUL
[3:39:27] <InugamiTheHound> @Sphincter_Spelunker please don't validate pat and his stand [crazy talk]
[3:39:28] <%UncleAWOL> That's fine
[3:39:31] <%MagickBurritoh> 60 is all you need
[3:39:37] <Jack_of_No_Trades> thats good
[3:39:38] <%RupanSen> not untli you try it
[3:39:38] <haisho> to be fair, it was Copperbell where mobs had weird ass tethers
[3:39:39] <%UncleAWOL> 60 is where it just FEELS good
[3:39:42] <%Typhaeon> Frame timings are more important
[3:39:47] <Moonlight_Grimoire> give me consistent, don't care if 60 or not
[3:39:47] <haisho> ...Copperbell Hard
[3:39:51] <%FoulNightingale> People saying 60 is all you need have never seen stable 144.
[3:39:54] <chronoxgp> i'd love to play a racing game at 144hz
[3:39:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @haisho group with people who are patient, or you warn beforehand. everyone's new at some point
[3:39:56] <%ElenaManetta> are you feeling it now, mister boivin
[3:40:01] <KageAruki> rhythm games are great at 144
[3:40:01] <%s_xylocalsingles> 8=D
[3:40:02] <ArmoredViking> I use vodka cooling for my PC @AngriestPat
[3:40:07] <+Shaggnar> Once you use it more often you can't go back
[3:40:07] <+Intolerable> 480p @ 24fps is all you need
[3:40:09] <%Aerkk> I could tell 60 vs 120hz only when playing FPS like Battlefield
[3:40:15] <+Grayhammatter> it's free real estate
[3:40:16] <%bakiinthedemon> 120 is about the max i care about. shit looks so smooth when I can get a game to run that
[3:40:16] <TastySammiches> don't boink the fish thats how you get reverse-mermaids
[3:40:17] <haisho> I hate the golem in Copperbell hard and I pray I never get it in roulettes again
[3:40:18] <%Aerkk> I can't tell in other games
