[0:01:58] <%FrostMass22> @lyzejag A Kojima
[0:02:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> like...I was on board for everything else, but then...wow.
[0:02:05] <HyperBomb21> what part did pat get to last time?
[0:02:14] <+zanzibar_junker> Lan-Di escapes. Nothing meaningful happens in Shenmue 3
[0:02:15] <lyzejag> @FrostMass22 Mmmmmh
[0:02:18] <jimmytwofeet> THIS IS PURGATORY NOW
[0:02:18] <ataxia72> that scene is clearly not meant to be taken seriously
[0:02:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> very clearly.
[0:02:30] <%thebiganxiety> @zanzibar_junker Wait seriously
[0:02:30] <nobody12349> I have only watched part 1 and kept intending to catch up with the vods but never actually caught up. I'm now going to watch the final part and be really confused.
[0:02:35] <%TheCallousKing> TheCallousKing subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[0:02:38] <HyperBomb21> What episode is Pat on now?
[0:02:40] <megakruemel> at least the purgatory has nice waiting music
[0:02:53] <spicy_2na> He’s on episode “Higgs”
[0:02:55] <%Mekhet09> More like nothing happens in shenmue 3.
[0:02:57] <%FrostMass22> @nobody12349 Don't worry, it is all very simple and easy to understand
[0:02:58] <HyperBomb21> Sweet
[0:03:00] <lyzejag> Episode 10 right ?
[0:03:10] <HyperBomb21> Did he beat he connect edge knot?
[0:03:22] <+DesertPenguin> Still not live yet right?
[0:03:23] <spicy_2na> Not yet I think
[0:03:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> He has not connected Edge knot yet
[0:03:29] <%Meow0369> @HyperBomb21 He crossed the tar pit
[0:03:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> about to tho
[0:03:33] <HyperBomb21> ok cool I ahvent missed it then
[0:03:37] <+DesertPenguin> oh snap i'm loading back in, got an ad...
[0:03:41] <nobody12349> Roadbuildman(final)
[0:03:43] <+zanzibar_junker> You train for hours and only play patty cake with Lan-Di
[0:03:46] <+Freelance7> @FrostMass22 Funny enough, Death Stranding is the easiest of Kojima's work to understand.
[0:03:50] <+DesertPenguin> I watch on TV through PS4 app and keep chat popped out on my laptop
[0:03:50] <HyperBomb21> Yeah, connecting Edge Knot is the point of no return
[0:03:54] <rytisone> We will not finish the game at this pace

[0:03:56] <jimmytwofeet> PAT HAS FORSAKEN HIS FLOCK
[0:03:59] <HyperBomb21> Im in episode 12 now
[0:04:00] <lyzejag> Last time Higgs licked Sam and Amelie was reveiled to be kinda a big deal
[0:04:09] <+DesertPenguin> Amelie is the EE
[0:04:12] <redrins> what even is the point of shenmue 3 if lan-di just escapes AGAIN
[0:04:22] <+DesertPenguin> Extinction Entity, meaning she's the catalyst for it?
[0:04:23] <RushUnplugged> more like SCAMmue 3
[0:04:27] <nobody12349> Did Higgs taste the taste of a liar?
[0:04:28] <spicy_2na> BBs, BTs, and EEs oh my!

[0:14:43] <lyzejag> Prepper*
[0:14:47] <ataxia72> where did you get the monster??
[0:14:47] <%Meow0369> Bell at this point might be a tad bit useless
[0:14:48] <rytisone> everything was muted to not risk of getting sex noises out
[0:14:48] <%xcompleasedad> Where did he get the Monster thinger from?
[0:14:50] <startstoprepeat> that's probably the best one but i need my big like number to increase so love knot forever
[0:14:52] <+ekimthegib> I used the bell the whole game, still don't know what it actually does
[0:14:54] <nukle0nik> i'd put on the ammo holder
[0:14:55] <+mr_dangus> I love how well the product placement worked
[0:14:57] <Djinnazz> How???
[0:14:59] <+NitronStreams> Amazon Prime Black Friday shipping simulator

[0:15:02] <lyzejag> Is there a LVL 3 cover Btw ?
[0:15:03] <nukle0nik> instead of the grenade bag and extra blood bags
[0:15:13] <Run44forrest> anyone else drining monster rn
[0:15:13] <nukle0nik> more ammo is way more useful than grenades and all those blood bags
[0:15:18] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> Who sets up the cans of monster in sam's room??
[0:15:25] <%Meow0369> "Hi sam let me creepily smile at you"
[0:15:25] <%Animorphimagi> did he five star every place?
[0:15:26] <Run44forrest> monkaS
[0:15:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @DesertPenguin I don't see why you would if there's only 1 time you don't have BB
[0:15:28] <+ekimthegib> Only a few things get to LVL 3

[1:05:39] <%derap41> Piss glass is strong
[1:05:42] <ahegotrigger> thats what bulletproof glass does
[1:05:43] <dukenux> BB okay
[1:05:45] <MessyBristles> I mean it survived a voidout
[1:05:45] <+Shadicara> Baby proof glass is unbreakable Kappa
[1:05:50] <arkv01> its gotta be bulletproof gorillaglass
[1:05:52] <+ekimthegib> survived three rockets too
[1:05:52] <%connos_procrastination> has to be given how much you fall on it
[1:05:53] <%derap41> Should use BB cans as armor
[1:05:53] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Use BB as a shield more often
[1:05:54] <%Laecerelius> BB is Unbreakable
[1:05:55] <%nofestu2> Made out of Pyrex

[1:06:09] <%Meow0369> @XeroSigmaPrime The last are from the specific mission
[1:06:09] <Idon__> The glass is strong because it needs to keep the baby in, not the bullets out
[1:06:11] <Run44forrest> if it was cybertruck glass BB would be dead Kappa
[1:06:11] <Demon_chann> i cant belive lou blocked bullet like shit man that crazy reflexes
[1:06:12] <%KillerKalamari> BB meatshield
[1:06:12] <%cha0tic_klutch> Cyber Truck Glass
[1:06:13] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Hell yeah when it has to endure the intense deep ocean like pressure of THE WOMB
[1:06:14] <+Sogeki_Dan> BB is fragile, but not that fragile
[1:06:18] <+D00msDayDan> gotta get to amelie. amelie. gotta get to amelie.
[1:06:19] <+Shadicara> Sam's bizarre adventure: Baby is Unbreakable

[1:06:23] <Lutre> balloon, balloon, gotta get the balloon
[1:06:23] <%Meow0369> @XeroSigmaPrime Does it reveal that it's higgs before the last ones?
[1:06:24] <$FluffiTamamo> It better be considering how many times Sam falls and eats shit
[1:06:25] <scottishwolf> That tower on his back is ridiculous
[1:06:28] <sergentjc> BB wants to fucking strangle Higgs
[1:06:30] <arkv01> naps will repair the glass
[1:06:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Meow0369 Yea

[1:06:51] <+ekimthegib> YOU MUST HURRY!, after this nap
[1:06:53] <vicious_rage> @cha0tic_klutch I had a conspiracy theory that Elon would feature the CyberTruck in this to promote it

[1:57:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Also, don't yet @zenith0111 still spoilers aboot
[1:57:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[1:57:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 57m.
[1:57:49] <%derap41> @chaospudding you don't think I've finished this game more than once already?
[1:57:49] <+QueequegTheater> Holy shit that ending sequence
[1:57:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> like...BIG spoilers
[1:57:52] <+QueequegTheater> !raffle
[1:57:55] <zenith0111> @zaphire_saucypants No worries :)
[1:58:07] <zenith0111> @zaphire_saucypants He's super close to the end
[1:58:10] <corpsegoo> I'm mildly excited to find out if I can handle the ending for a second time when the first time wrecked me for like two weeks
[1:58:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Kojima writes cool sounding stuff first and does his best to make it all make sense after
[1:58:15] <Hellarussian> 5 more chapters
[1:58:15] <%Meow0369> @derap41 If you don't get it after finishing it you weren't paying attention mate
[1:58:16] <+QueequegTheater> !society
[1:58:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @zenith0111 I'm so excited for his reaction
[1:58:21] <+NitronStreams> These cutscenes are fucking dumb tho. whether or not the plot makes sense at the end.
[1:58:32] <%GarbageNirvana> He doesn't always succeed
[1:58:39] <%derap41> @Meow0369 Not getting it is the worst fucking excuse
[1:58:42] <vapeking42069> Boy I didn't expect death stranding to be a JESUS metaphore but here we are
[1:58:42] <zenith0111> I like thematic endings
[1:58:43] <Bigbossman91> @corpsegoo i beat the game last night, so i know how you feel
[1:58:46] <Demon_chann> idk whyy people are so surprise as how dumb this game is is kojima for fuck sake
[1:58:47] <chaospudding> @derap41 if you finished the game then I'm not sure how it didn't all make sense to you in the end
[1:58:50] <+QueequegTheater> Well yeah, Kojima isn't a good writer, he just has good presentation of his awful writing
[1:58:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> same @zenith0111
[1:58:53] <%DatGuyJimbo> I actually really enjoyed the ending cutscene
[1:59:05] <tr00ly_> I bet this loser is gonna wash his hanfs
[1:59:06] <%BurningLlama777> I'm still smiling over Sam and Amelie frolicking merrily down the coastline
[1:59:09] <%chiluzza> aww did he finish it
[1:59:10] <VidulaSaix> I disagree, I do think he's a good writer but he despertely needs editing
[1:59:11] <Hellarussian> this is the most Kojima Kojima game
[1:59:13] <%GarbageNirvana> He's more about symbolism than substance
[1:59:13] <%DisGuyOvahEre> i really hope this game ends like metal gear 1/3/4/5 instead of like how it did in 2
[1:59:18] <nukle0nik> finish it? he has like 4 hours left
[1:59:20] <Demon_chann> i woudlnt call him awful he has his moments
[1:59:23] <SethAm_> piss break
[1:59:23] <%iaraCatunda> @chiluzza nope justa break
[1:59:25] <%wydamn> Pat, Skelmo, Elmo, and "Beach"
[1:59:26] <%SvenHolgersson> this is the ONLY Kojima game that matters
[1:59:30] <vapeking42069> @chiluzza no we still got a whole movie to watch
[1:59:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @QueequegTheater While I enjoy Kojima, I do feel he needs to have an editor at all times. Can be a GREAT director, but...
[1:59:31] <+QueequegTheater> @Demon_chann So does David Cage
[1:59:34] <+NitronStreams> Kojima has never made me physically groan before this game.
[1:59:34] <%Meow0369> @derap41 For real, if you think the plot fell apart you clearly either didn't play it and just skipped around cutscenes or didn't pay attention
[1:59:46] <ProfessorLitmus> see the sun set, the day is ending. let that yawn out, there's no pretending.
[1:59:52] <SomersaultJustice> it's time to strand the death!
[1:59:55] <%BurningLlama777> I'm half wondering if Death Stranding came around because Kojima finally learned what "heat death" was and got super freaked out.
[1:59:57] <%GarbageNirvana> The only reason he gets more respect than David Cage does is cause his games are actually fun
[1:59:57] <$Mothman742> What is chats greatest weakness and biggest strength?
[1:59:58] <corpsegoo> I am fond of kojima for the same reason I am fond of tarintino, because they manages to match my incredibly trashy tastes
[1:59:58] <VidulaSaix> Yeah this plot is very disgestable. If you dont get it, you just didnt pay attention
[2:00:01] <zenith0111> This game is cool if you're a person about metaphors and themes. If you're just here for ghosts then you're going to be disappointed
[2:00:06] <lewisnlm> This is a real gamer pee
[2:00:19] <Hellarussian> hullo
[2:00:19] <%Meow0369> I was shocked at how much sense it made by the end of the game
[2:00:20] <vapeking42069> It's not that the plot falls apart its just unsatisfying and awful
[2:00:21] <%Alpha8087> WB sir
[2:00:23] <%DisGuyOvahEre> death stranding is that one episode of family guy where peter tricks death
[2:00:23] <lyzejag> Was the piss good
[2:00:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yea
[2:00:26] <%thegreenbenis> PAT DADDY

[2:00:34] <%mister___doctor> Wheres your cube, boi
[2:00:34] <+LtSergei> baby yoda
[2:00:38] <%KillerKalamari> did you weaponize your piss?
[2:00:38] <+QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Reminder that Kojima is just David Cage with better gameplay

[2:01:14] <%derap41> @vapeking42069 what do you think falling apart mean? Its a story not a display of events if you can't tell it well its not worth hearing
[2:01:15] <Plugman86> how long does reading donations usually go o
[2:01:16] <$FluffiTamamo> Wasting that quality piss on a toilet and not Higgs’ face
[2:01:17] <zenith0111> Keep On Keepin' On
[2:01:17] <corpsegoo> the difference between tarantino and kojima is that kojima understands how much I want to fuck lee van cleef
[2:01:19] <%bigstupidjellyfish1337> Hey don’t tell Elmo to shut up!!!!!! 😡😡😡
[2:01:19] <koolaid_kevster> aall this pizza talk got me ordering pizza

[2:01:27] <%DisGuyOvahEre> @AngriestPat is it true that woolie still cant use ladders like a normal person
[2:01:28] <KeystoneA1> !uptime
[2:01:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @QueequegTheater Nah. David Cage WISHES he was Kojima...hell, he might actually wish that. At least Kojima manages to keep my attention with his brand of weird shit.
[2:01:29] <%thegreenbenis> ELMO
[2:01:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 1m.

[2:01:48] <ovan20> DAH BABY! rooCry
[2:01:50] <%silvery_cricket> Tell Elmo ghosts arent scary you can defeat them with pee
[2:01:53] <%Flightedwings> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[2:02:01] <marvel877> You also can not use ladders for trucks.
[2:02:06] <%AngriestAngryArtist> sounds like power supply problem there
[2:02:07] <%SvenHolgersson> Okay mister moneybags
[2:02:07] <%Divryne> That's probably a PSU wattage issue.
[2:02:15] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Probably overheating or Power supply
[2:02:17] <%Keyd00d> I've never seen woolie and a ladder in the same room...
[2:02:18] <Demon_chann> same thing happing with my laptop screen randomly goes black
[2:02:21] <%velemi> YOU SHOULD HAVE PISSED
[2:02:21] <%AngriestAngryArtist> @Divryne LOL right?
[2:02:25] <%crazyspartan214> crazyspartan214 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat! Been following you guys since "Two Best Friend Play" Thank for many years of laughter and bullshit moments
[2:02:25] <WolfHavocX> jaboodyLurk
[2:02:27] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[2:02:27] <Demon_chann> i may have to buy a new one
[2:02:37] <%cureneckbeard> abipopSNACK
[2:02:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pretty obvious
[2:02:40] <lyzejag> TIP : DO
[2:02:46] <+코코꾸라> yeah but don't get too close
[2:02:51] <%Maids4lyfe> he means don't go to lake knot
[2:02:51] <+QueequegTheater> @Zaphire_Saucypants Both are great scene directors, who have interesting ideas, bogged down with stupid nonsense often involving ghosts, and leave more questions than answers. The only difference is Kojima makes decent gameplay
[2:02:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Tippo: DO DA THANG
[2:02:56] <Rotabrutsama> atpBigot time of reckoning is coming atpBigot
[2:03:03] <+QueequegTheater> LOOK HIS NAME IS HEARTMAN
[2:03:25] <%SaiyanShoto> Merge with the couch!
[2:03:28] <Demon_chann> my name is hotdogman
[2:03:31] <+thewellroundedgamer99> LUL
[2:03:32] <%SvenHolgersson> more like Fartman
[2:03:34] <+LtSergei> Peter Englert is the most obscure name in this game
[2:03:34] <Demon_chann> i make hotdogs
[2:03:34] <%SvenHolgersson> #gottem
[2:03:36] <chronoxgp> so this will take like 2 seconds...
[2:03:37] <+QueequegTheater> YOU SEE, HIS NAME IS HEARTMAN BECAUSE HE HAS ZE HEART CONDITION. EMOSHUNZ
[2:03:44] <%mister___doctor> Reminder that in the time it took you to use the bathroom and read those donations Heartman probably died
[2:03:44] <FalseEyeD> SMELLMO
[2:03:51] <MSN04_Sazabi> @QueequegTheater Does Kojima make the gameplay though? Maybe his studio is just better than Cage's.
[2:03:54] <Shwepie> When's the 2 hour cutscene where Elmoman explains his nice feet?
[2:03:55] <+QueequegTheater> You are now reading that in Cage's voice
[2:03:59] <%crazyspartan214> ROBOT HORSE!!!!!
[2:04:00] <%derap41> @QueequegTheater You can't seriously call the last hour Pats been playing "decent gameplay"
[2:04:17] <munchkay> Is his name Die-hardman cuz he's "hard to kill"?
[2:04:21] <+QueequegTheater> @derap41 I'm thinking more of MGS
[2:04:28] <morningmoondude> wait, those things are just horizon zero dawnborgs
[2:04:28] <%derap41> XD
[2:04:29] <chronoxgp> cage and kojima both do the shower thing
[2:04:30] <%xcompleasedad> @munchkay Yes, but NOOOOOO
[2:04:30] <Hellarussian> pretty good
[2:04:35] <%Keyd00d> The final hour of this game made me feel emotions which is more than I can say for Cage
[2:04:36] <%thegreenbenis> @munchkay He dies hard, man.
[2:04:39] <Kongro_> Imagine if David Cage and Kojima made a game together
[2:04:40] <%PinkSuprende> No his name is DIe-Hardman because his name is fucking John Blake McClaine
[2:04:48] <%megabrogus> Sam is a pos what a dick

[2:05:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Hit the Terrorist camp!
[2:05:43] <%derap41> @chaospudding it was thematically weak and the gameplay was running up to him and parrying his predictable attack
[2:05:43] <chronoxgp> cats love doritos salt
[2:05:44] <%abakkus> elmo is anti-gamer
[2:05:46] <Badgerconda_> He just want little a salami

[2:06:05] <chaospudding> higgs is hilarious and over the top, why shouldn't his boss fight be the same?
[2:06:08] <Gruntini> Death Stranding; but Sam in a lineman instead of a deliveryman
[2:06:08] <+QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I hope Kojima's next project is a joint with David Cage so we can all drown in the combined self-importance and blatant imagery

[2:08:56] <Shwepie> @QueequegTheater I don't think they can work together. When David Cage pulls this shit it feels pretentious as fuck. When Kojima does it, it feels like he is saying, "I like this and thought it was cool."
[2:08:56] <Demon_chann> @CelioHogane excuse me?
[2:08:56] <marvel877> I too remember Woolie's racist cat story.

[2:10:57] <Zereaux> BITE THE DOG BACK ASSERT DOMINANCE
[2:10:58] <FalseEyeD> Paige's Kojima name is Face/Off
[2:11:00] <chronoxgp> if a dog bites you in the face it's pretty violent
[2:11:00] <ProfessorLitmus> dont get a bulldog, they tend to have eye problems that involve you having to push them back into their heads whenever they sneeze or bark too hard
[2:11:01] <mikewrobe> yea and a cat scracthed my balls when i owned one
[2:11:01] <+Evitron1> i dont mean to be rude paige but why were you in fucking Cujo
[2:11:01] <+AXL808> the dog had Paige's face for lunch
[2:11:03] <sergentjc> DESU IS BREEDIST AGAINST PITBULLS
[2:11:03] <+かしくら> that's fair you win this contest :) I wasn't locked in a car with the dog

[2:11:09] <%DisGuyOvahEre> Nicholas Page
[2:11:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YO CHAT @DESUDESUDOKIDOKI HATES PIT BULLS, GET HIM
[2:11:10] <%KillerKalamari> you should have bit the owner's face
[2:11:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Kojima is blatant and refreshing while Cage is more insincere about the politics in his games.
[2:11:11] <+QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Was the dog not female, so Paige couldn't kill it back
[2:11:13] <marvel877> Compare dog mauling notes with Maximillian
[2:11:13] <%Meow0369> Yes
[2:11:14] <%Soulbishop> That dog was in 5 nights at Freddies.
[2:11:16] <mikesapartment> yes
[2:11:17] <KingKZ> That Revelations 2 stream was nuts. Finding out how broken Paige is was surreal.
[2:11:17] <%SvenHolgersson> feed the rich to the dogs

[2:11:19] <chaospudding> my sister got mauled by a dog when she was like 12, it totally messed up her shoulder for years, she still isn't comfortable around dogs even 15 years later
[2:11:19] <+MechaBaphomet> You report that shit and it gets taken care of. How the fuck does it go on to bite 7 people
[2:11:21] <Nina96> rip
[2:11:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> permenent rain
[2:11:22] <%ekimthegib> It's a little rough
[2:11:23] <NotHereToStream> shits fucked
[2:11:23] <%Sephirios> smol dogs usually are more bity, but on the othe hand big dogs eat your entire face in 1 sec

[2:11:43] <SharKinStereo> when I was very young, my mom got a pet dog for the family. I took it out for a walk once and it dragged me down the sidewalk. We didn't have the dog anymore after that. Dogs are like people...some are good, some are bad.
[2:11:43] <Daskolin> In RUSSIA we are breaking dogs neck if its even look wrong way at child!!!
[2:11:44] <%FrostMass22> Bite Face-Dog

[2:12:21] <Dutchpotato> @wynnewake yes
[2:12:22] <corpsegoo> small dogs being arsehole is usually because people refuse to teach them manners and don't breed for friendliness because people don't take their bites seriously
[2:12:23] <Djinnazz> Why was there no lawsuit involved?

[2:13:42] <%ekimthegib> Good Call
[2:13:43] <sauce_boss_88> My friend successfully sued their old neighbors because their dog came and attacked his face one day while they were outside. It left a permanent scar on his face. Lawyer gave him a choice of one-time payment or gradual payments with interest. He took the long-term and it’s paid for his home and car.
[2:13:45] <Demon_chann> cuz it tried to bit my lil sis
[2:13:47] <corpsegoo> I'm fond of pomeranians because when I was like twelve I got assaulted and the person who helped me after had poms, and the poms tried to bring me the toilet brush to make me feel better
[2:13:49] <%Maids4lyfe> good thinking

[2:14:09] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat Fuck when I think about it I've been attacked by dogs A LOT in my life.
[2:14:09] <Casavilla458> it wouldn't have hurt the game if the world map was a bit smaller
[2:14:10] <%derap41> 4-6 left

[2:49:50] <Sol_Install> HAHHA
[2:49:52] <%Soulbishop> was he falling through time?
[2:50:03] <%derap41> @StaceMcGate fucking thank you
[2:50:14] <nukle0nik> notlikethis
[2:50:19] <NotHereToStream> shame higgs was pretty 1 dimensional
[2:50:20] <arkv01> higgs watched A LOT of anime
[2:50:23] <%keyworthe> i hate kojimbos info dumb
[2:50:25] <%keyworthe> i fucking hate it
[2:50:35] <%Animorphimagi> SUPER spoilers here
[2:50:38] <+boki_86> why?
[2:50:40] <HoIlywood_SN> @keyworthe i mean this is all optional
[2:50:40] <%ekimthegib> I love it
[2:50:41] <%derap41> I know Kojima backloads his stories but fucking hell
[2:50:43] <arkv01> mmm dadddy kojamjam
[2:50:45] <+Rolandknight> ugh read this later
[2:50:49] <nukle0nik> THERE'S 28 OF THESE
[2:50:50] <+MechaBaphomet> Kujombodoes it again
[2:50:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WOW HIGGS WAS GOOD?!
[2:50:52] <nukle0nik> PAIGE STOP HIM
[2:50:52] <waifoong98> "SoCiEtY"
[2:50:56] <%netrac> Having a cohesive narrative is a lost art it seems
[2:50:56] <zenith0111> Higgs represented Nihilism rmzLURK
[2:50:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @derap41 sam's main goal has always been centered around Amelie, trying to "rescue" her. And over the course of the game he goes from an isolated man to one who's less afraid to connect to others. Not spoilers by this point btw.
[2:50:59] <%ekimthegib> KEEP READING
[2:51:00] <Aydarkzero> oh Christ
[2:51:01] <OuterHades> I wish for tapes to be back Kappa
[2:51:10] <%keyworthe> @HoIlywood_SN but what if i want to know about him but not read a book?
[2:51:17] <%keyworthe> fucking kojumbo

[2:51:40] <%derap41> @Zaphire_Saucypants yes that sam but I was speaking of the main characters not our vector into the narative
[2:51:44] <%velemi> oh fuck off
[2:51:46] <%netrac> I want a mod for the pc version with TTS for the journals
[2:51:49] <nukle0nik> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:51:51] <%StaceMcGate> This is a ridiculous amount of story for a red herring villain
[2:51:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @derap41 And yeah, I know you're just being a shit, but I figured I might as well answer you seriously.
[2:51:55] <herfaintsmile> thats not why people built sarcophagus and coffins dipshits
[2:51:55] <MrDonTacos_> oh wow
[2:52:00] <Demon_chann> WOW
[2:52:00] <%ekimthegib> I love this anime shit
[2:52:04] <King_thunder365> Komm Susser Tod
[2:52:04] <%cureneckbeard> life mask
[2:52:05] <%Valdorick> Later - ALWAYS TAKES OFF HIS MASK TO SHOW HIS FUCKING FACE
[2:52:07] <HoIlywood_SN> @keyworthe i mean, where would that have fit in the story with his role as a crazy bad guy?
[2:52:11] <zenith0111> 5/24
[2:52:11] <%MegboyManuel> yknow the best thing is, none of this is voiced like in phantom pain
[2:52:14] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but why does he wear make up?
[2:52:15] <%derap41> @Zaphire_Saucypants I am being a lot of a shit right now but fuck look at this
[2:52:15] <%Meow0369> @Zaphire_Saucypants I blocked him, he's just an asshole
[2:52:22] <HoIlywood_SN> like either its a forced exposition dump ina cutscene, or optional reading material
[2:52:31] <%Meow0369> @Zaphire_Saucypants Just spoiling shit too
[2:52:32] <+QueequegTheater> BTS ARE COMING FOR OUR TIME GUNS
[2:52:36] <Aydarkzero> @Valdorick it's like none of it mattered!
[2:52:39] <+professormorrigan> did we have princess beach already
[2:52:40] <%Aeoneth> Aeoneth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Pat, Enjoying Death stranding right alongside you. Keep making the postmen proud and complete your manifest destiny by becoming America
[2:52:40] <arkv01> finally woke after the apocalypse
[2:52:43] <arkv01> burgers never did shit
[2:52:45] <%derap41> @Meow0369 I haven't spoiled shit
[2:52:49] <zenith0111> OOF
[2:53:00] <%otakuisaiah> OOF indeed!
[2:53:07] <%Meow0369> Something I never found out, is higgs a repatriate?
[2:53:09] <%MadMatt2099> @professormorrigan Yup
[2:53:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Zaphire_Saucypants Yea, its pissing me off that Mods haven't banned that spoiling little shit
[2:53:21] <+professormorrigan> what did pat think of it
[2:53:23] <zenith0111> @meow0369 He straight says it LUL
[2:53:24] <nukle0nik> pat are you really gonna read all of this jesus
[2:53:25] <King_thunder365> The true America was the Friends we made along the way.
[2:53:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Meow0369 I think so.
[2:53:34] <%StaceMcGate> Demens reminds me of Charles Barkley Shut up and Jam Gaiden
[2:53:35] <%keyworthe> @HoIlywood_SN lots of ways, im not a game dev but i can see from miles away that +100 pages of lore, which is mostly formed of bad writing is not it.
[2:53:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Meow0369 It's what I gathered from his diary
[2:53:43] <%Meow0369> @zenith0111 I can't remember, I remember vaguely that he implies it at that boss battle but not outright saying it
[2:53:52] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> so, how bout them local sports teams?
[2:54:04] <arkv01> oh higgs was MAD jelly
[2:54:06] <%MadMatt2099> @professormorrigan Didn't have a big reaction.
[2:54:11] <waifoong98> Fragile eh
[2:54:14] <%DatGuyJimbo> jesus stop whining about the interviews it's an optional thing in the game
[2:54:22] <%Teintstein> the beach the beach let's go get away
[2:54:22] <%cureneckbeard> She's not that fragile
[2:54:23] <zenith0111> @meow0369 For a game like this that's your job as the player to pick up on it. If not oh well
[2:54:23] <%derap41> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw doing well have won the last 5 games and with a min 4 point lead
[2:54:24] <+MechaBaphomet> Who needs story telling when you can dump it into text files
[2:54:28] <seainspace> lets go to the beach beach
[2:54:29] <+professormorrigan> damn, thought that line was peak kojima :/
[2:54:38] <%netrac> LORE.txt
[2:54:40] <%keyworthe> @MechaBaphomet right?
[2:54:46] <%derap41> This isn't how you tell a good story
[2:54:49] <+QueequegTheater> peak Kojima, yes. A good thing? No
[2:54:58] <arkv01> I don't know what the rest of you come for but I live for ASMR lore
[2:54:59] <%FrostMass22> @datguyjimbo Not knowing the story unless you read 1000+ words' worth of story in side-content is bad writing
[2:55:02] <%Meow0369> @zenith0111 Sure, I just wasn't sure. They made a big deal of talking about how sam is a dooms and a repatriate and how that's the only one in the world they know of
[2:55:04] <%keyworthe> it's fucking awful, dont care if it's optional
[2:55:04] <+professormorrigan> i didnt say that was a good thing lol
[2:55:06] <ChrisM341> ReadHardman
[2:55:06] <nukle0nik> fuuuuuuuck

[2:55:14] <%reonome> SAMANTHA
[2:55:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmhmmm....
[2:55:16] <AliceAstro> why
[2:55:17] <%reonome> SAM???
[2:55:18] <Hellarussian> EEEEEVIl
[2:55:18] <+REDtheBEAST> walrusMeow WutFace walrusF
[2:55:22] <%iaraCatunda> SAMANTHA
[2:55:23] <%Valdorick> Incest baby.
[2:55:25] <%reonome> fucking really
[2:55:25] <%miguelrod777> HMMMMM
[2:55:27] <%crazyspartan214> THE BABY!!!!
[2:55:28] <%Meow0369> @zenith0111 Also I never found every single diary, just some early ones and the last ones
[2:55:30] <Kejang> literally just make this an audiobook while you walk
[2:55:34] <%cureneckbeard> sipsipBaby
[2:55:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i kew sam was bb
[2:55:39] <SuperCreeperBlocks> aleksCheck
[2:55:44] <%FrostMass22> Palpatine was behind it all
[2:55:48] <NotHereToStream> should of been audio logs for truckin'
[2:55:50] <%derap41> This sure is a cool way to find out this amazing twist
[2:55:51] <+professormorrigan> What organic storytelling.
[2:55:53] <Run44forrest> im not paying attention what happened
[2:55:58] <%StaceMcGate> Is Amelie's stand [DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP]?
[2:56:00] <%keyworthe> why wasn't these fucking audio logs you're right
[2:56:01] <%miguelrod777> JAR JAR WAS THE TRUE EMPEROR
[2:56:03] <+QueequegTheater> faith of the earth
[2:56:06] <%keyworthe> what th efuck kojimbo
[2:56:07] <%Meow0369> They should have made these audio codecs like MGS5 tbh
[2:56:09] <+MechaBaphomet> Even MGS didnt do this lazy shit. MGV at least had voice logs.
[2:56:12] <Run44forrest> amelie has a stand??
[2:56:15] <+Freelance7> THe thing is, the twist came to me, even without reading.
[2:56:20] <phatmac16> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:56:24] <Shwepie> @Kejang Spent too much money on one of celebrities to have voice acting for diaries.
[2:56:26] <%FrostMass22> @run44forrest Kojima wrote a novel to explain the character of Higgs instead, you know, actually writing a single coherent story
[2:56:26] <%derap41> I mean I like this game why the fuck do I like this game
[2:56:28] <+Freelance7> The game actually tells you, not through this. But Pat is like this, soooo
[2:56:29] <zenith0111> @meow0369 His diary doesn't explain his powers LUL just his backstory and motivation
[2:56:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> probably would have run out of road by this point @keyworthe before it even finished
[2:56:43] <herfaintsmile> yeah just dump essential characterization of a major villain into the codex WHY NOT
[2:56:44] <%netrac> It's not like this game has long streches of just walking that could be suitable to an audiolog
[2:56:47] <waifoong98> casually nuke
[2:56:48] <valriot> @mechabaphomet These were available early in the game before we even knew it was Higgs, dumb fuck. learn to read.
[2:56:49] <megakruemel> "dear diary, today i did some shit"
[2:56:49] <%DatGuyJimbo> if you didn't figure this out before reading this you are super brain dead it's not spoilers
[2:56:51] <%keyworthe> @Zaphire_Saucypants yeah..
[2:56:52] <%reonome> dear diary
[2:56:53] <NotHereToStream> its fine to like a game and still critique the shitty aspect of the game
[2:56:56] <%StaceMcGate> Plot Twist: The woman who sang London Bridge is Falling Down in your dreams may be a baddie
[2:56:58] <Hellarussian> so Amilie made him super evil
[2:56:59] <+professormorrigan> Death Stranding: Vol I
[2:57:01] <ChrisM341> The Kazuhira Burger
[2:57:04] <%Meow0369> @valriot Woah no need for that level of hostility
[2:57:05] <%FrostMass22> I beat the game and I still don't know what DOOMS does or what exactly a Death Stranding is
[2:57:10] <Run44forrest> ok higgs sounds like a DOOMER freak
[2:57:13] <%Aeoneth> Because Higgs wasn't anything in Sam's story. He's a footnote, an obstacle that Sam overcame
[2:57:14] <%Meow0369> @FrostMass22 Were you paying attention?
[2:57:15] <NotHereToStream> I like this game too, and yeah, it fucking flawed beyond high hell
[2:57:20] <OuterHades> ohnWeird ohnMAKEITSTOP
[2:57:21] <%ekimthegib> The real Death Stranding is the friends we made along the way
[2:57:22] <seainspace> loooool
[2:57:22] <phatmac16> Kojima doesn't get show don't tell
[2:57:25] <%keyworthe> ADOPTED
[2:57:26] <%derap41> @herfaintsmile must have taken steps from Final Fantasy 14 why tell a story when you can just write it out
[2:57:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Theres so much shit in the cutscenes and hints in the dialogue. Interviews are great, they just make it easy for others who didnt pick up on this stuff during the cutscenes
[2:57:27] <AliceAstro> he looooves him
[2:57:29] <MSN04_Sazabi> NOT BLOOD RELATED MEANS INCEST IS OKAY Kappa
[2:57:30] <OuterHades> ohnKoji ohnMAKEITSTOP
[2:57:31] <%FrostMass22> @meow0369 To what was actually in the game? Yes
[2:57:31] <%keyworthe> HE CAN FUCK HIM THEN
[2:57:32] <%medusasghost> of couuuurse
[2:57:33] <zenith0111> Motherfucker LUL
[2:57:33] <%ekimthegib> Adopted so it's all good
[2:57:36] <%keyworthe> THAT'S WHAT THE PORNHUB SAID
[2:57:36] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> so this is where the story begins?
[2:57:36] <+QueequegTheater> Higgs, it's only an act if you're a sociopath
[2:57:38] <%cvp5127> incest is a go
[2:57:40] <phatmac16> INCEST IS WINCEST
[2:57:40] <%Meow0369> @FrostMass22 Death stranding = extinction event causing beaches. DOOMS is explained either already or later don't wanna spoil
[2:57:42] <%Keyd00d> Chat needs to chill a bit
[2:57:44] <%keyworthe> *she
[2:57:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> While I love me some Kojima, he DOES need an editor badly.
[2:57:46] <%HRDSalami654> MAWA.
[2:57:46] <Vertigheist> death stranding is kojima's diary
[2:57:52] <+SammyKiller> This guy was out to get me man
[2:57:57] <redrins> so higgs is a whiny jealous baby
[2:58:07] <megakruemel> jup
[2:58:08] <%derap41> Did someone stamp when he began reading?
[2:58:08] <%ekimthegib> @Meow0369 Yeah, they kind of explain DOOMS soon
[2:58:14] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Can we stop complaining about interviews, they just highlight what you should already know/assume from the cutscenes and dialogue
[2:58:16] <%keyworthe> man death stranding is fun
[2:58:17] <HoIlywood_SN> you guys remember the game isnt over yet right?
[2:58:18] <%keyworthe> but holy shit
[2:58:23] <%keyworthe> kojima is awful
[2:58:25] <%keyworthe> at writing
[2:58:25] <%Valdorick> So... Higgs is to Sam what Amelie is to Fragile?
[2:58:26] <%FrostMass22> @xerosigmaprime No
[2:58:29] <megakruemel> 9.3 best game of the series
[2:58:35] <%Meow0369> @ekimthegib I thought it was later ye I think it's in maybe an hour
[2:58:36] <phatmac16> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:58:36] <Sokumotanaka> @redrins IT seems like everyone but reedus and deadman seem petty and whiny
[2:58:37] <%netrac> This would be a fine novella with some editing
[2:58:44] <AliceAstro> reading simulator 7
[2:58:44] <Kejang> @XeroSigmaPrime how can you surmise all this backstory from Higgses cutscenes?
[2:58:46] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Kojima is quoting the bible again?
[2:58:46] <+MechaBaphomet> 40/40 perfect
[2:58:49] <seainspace> sa,,y boy
[2:58:52] <%netrac> or if it was given over the course of the game
[2:58:57] <%derap41> @XeroSigmaPrime I can promise you no one would know shit about anything without these
[2:58:58] <+Freelance7> I mean, it's actually my game of the year.
[2:58:59] <%deviljhojho_> Man higgs is such a jackass
[2:59:00] <PraiseHemra> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:59:01] <%Meow0369> Deadman is the best character, no bullshit, just a guy trying to live his life
[2:59:03] <%Bailey__gaming> Big Reading
[2:59:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Kejang Actually, yes. you can
[2:59:09] <+Fynale> so i totally just remembered that League has a Gurren Laggan skin
[2:59:11] <+QueequegTheater> THIS IS FUCKING TERRIBLE
[2:59:14] <OldManDeckardCain> truth tapes it ain't
[2:59:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:59:17] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> eh whatever
[2:59:19] <+Freelance7> @derap41 I knew this, and I never read this shit
[2:59:20] <megakruemel> I still love this game. But this is hilarious.
[2:59:21] <%cvp5127> LUL
[2:59:21] <%cureneckbeard> it's called Edge Knot City because Higgs is an edgelord
[2:59:21] <zenith0111> @kejang You don't need his backstory to understand the themes he represents for the story
[2:59:22] <neekocheeko> it doesnt end
[2:59:23] <+zanzibar_junker> Amelia is METATRON
[2:59:23] <%StaceMcGate> My disguise LUL
[2:59:26] <waifoong98> sore loser LUL
[2:59:26] <Hellarussian> LUL
[2:59:29] <VidulaSaix> Why is it terrible? God damn chat is too stupid to follow anything LUL
[2:59:30] <%Maids4lyfe> NOT SEE THROUGH HIS DISGUISE WHAT
[2:59:30] <%Valdorick> Likely the fact I'm Nolan North.
[2:59:30] <Demon_chann> LUL
[2:59:31] <%reonome> "disguise"
[2:59:32] <+Darren716> Yeah who does read that shit
[2:59:32] <Heartless_01> LUL
[2:59:33] <+professormorrigan> Die-Hardman has a god-tier performance later. That's all I got from watching a full playthrough :)
[2:59:33] <+MechaBaphomet> Does this have any voice logs or is it all text files?
[2:59:33] <AliceAstro> ma boyees
[2:59:35] <ataxia72> these docs are great, Higgs is hilarious
[2:59:38] <%Meow0369> That disguise literally everyone saw through INSTANTLY
[2:59:38] <phatmac16> LUL
[2:59:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @derap41 I can promise you can. I guess you didnt really pay attention?
[2:59:43] <17sevens> he literally wrote and registered the package as small nuclear weapon
[2:59:45] <%PinkSuprende> "Maybe writing thermo nuclear weapon" on the tag was a bad idea Higgs
[2:59:47] <%netrac> Would be great if you did get to know higgs via the logs during the game instead of a postkill infodump
[2:59:50] <%StaceMcGate> "I put on a trucker hat, no way could they have seen through that"
[2:59:57] <Sokumotanaka> True bumble king here
[3:00:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> E D G E
[3:00:03] <+SammyKiller> I don't wanna suffer tho
[3:00:14] <Kejang> @XeroSigmaPrime sure love smelling your own farts huh
[3:00:14] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> we're not so different, you and I
[3:00:18] <+Darren716> Fuck i just wanna go eat lol
[3:00:18] <%Meow0369> G-MAN?
[3:00:19] <Tha_Mik> what
[3:00:21] <AliceAstro> she is a nuke
[3:00:23] <%FrostMass22> Just ripoff Half-Life I guesd
[3:00:25] <%Aleate> Wake up, Mr. Freeman...
[3:00:26] <ChrisM341> Shadow The Hedgehog Man
[3:00:28] <phatmac16> We're not so different you and I
[3:00:32] <%netrac> I called the we're not so different
[3:00:37] <Djinnazz> So Higgs didn’t have a clue about Cliff.
[3:00:38] <%keyworthe> man, they should have just wrote sam to be all "I JUST WANNA DELIVER THE FUCKING PACKAGES, GIMME COOL GEAR" all game, would be much better
[3:00:38] <startstoprepeat> higgs has real "that nothing antagonist from mass effect 3" energy
[3:00:40] <artoflec> i know i said it before, but why did they format the text to be the most annoying way to read.
[3:00:40] <King_thunder365> WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE. WE GOT FUN AND GAMES!
[3:00:41] <%reonome> SUBTLELY
[3:00:47] <+Freelance7> It's a good thing he's reading here. Making up for all the time he skipped by using that zipline.
[3:00:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @kejang, no I love smelling Kojima's rather than complain about reading some story in excerpts
[3:00:52] <+awalkingdude> People defend the game saying you don't understand it, but no it's the actual story and plot points that are baaaaad
[3:00:53] <%deviljhojho_> lmao get fucked
[3:00:54] <+Loyks> THE CHIP
[3:00:54] <CrypticMochi> All the pizza powered his crazy
[3:00:55] <phatmac16> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:00:56] <Shwepie> @StaceMcGate Yes, the guy who never saw Higgs' face and only heard his voice onces was fooled by the trucker hat disguise.
[3:00:56] <NeroInfinite> SUbtlty
[3:00:57] <herfaintsmile> its literally a death monologue in text i hate this so much
[3:00:57] <zenith0111> BibleThump
[3:00:58] <Jflaskd13> LUL
[3:00:59] <%StaceMcGate> Even the game acknowledges Higgs was pointless
[3:00:59] <alwayspronking> Clap
[3:01:01] <%cureneckbeard> look at this shakespeare-quoting edgelord
[3:01:02] <%theAncopro> that is correct
[3:01:03] <Demon_chann> YAY
[3:01:03] <zenith0111> NIHILISM
[3:01:04] <Delenay> but when did he write that?
[3:01:04] <%Valdorick> D-did he fucking... Teleport to his hide out as he was getting his ass kicked... just to write in his journel?
[3:01:07] <BRBN310> half life? "wake up and smell the ashes"
[3:01:07] <%vaporousTippler> This confession is meaningless.

[3:01:19] <AliceAstro> very beatable
[3:01:19] <Asuxley> and the dick
[3:01:20] <+QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat That was worse writing than anything Cage has written except MAYBE Omikron
[3:01:22] <Tha_Mik> but didn't pee on him
[3:01:22] <waifoong98> he is a sore jobber LUL
[3:01:24] <VidulaSaix> No, hes alive. That last mail was written after the Beach
[3:01:29] <zenith0111> @sergentjc His Diary stated it.
[3:01:29] <savagedeviljayho> is this post game?

[3:01:33] <ChrisM341> Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the BB
[3:01:35] <karl_rex> So what was in Higgs' bunker?
[3:01:35] <%Soulbishop> the first game with a bumble win?
[3:01:37] <redrins> at least he's hot
[3:01:38] <Mastigias> Sam is a Boomer and Higgs is a Doomer?
[3:01:38] <Jflaskd13> his mistake was having a lifebar, all too common
[3:01:39] <%keyworthe> watch this game win game of the year
[3:01:40] <AliceAstro> looks fine
[3:01:40] <neekocheeko> @savagedeviljayho no

[3:01:55] <ataxia72> it is goty
[3:01:56] <CelioHogane> Oh shit i got the perfect name for that tornado, IT'S A TIME STORM.
[3:01:58] <HoIlywood_SN> there is still game left also
[3:01:59] <+QueequegTheater> I don't like Kojumbo's writing
[3:02:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw YOURE GOD DAMN RIGHT
[3:02:01] <+Freelance7> At least Kojima uses his writing better.
[3:02:02] <%Deft_Thought> So if the Timefall was persistent like this for days or weeks, that'd be game over for everything, right?
[3:02:05] <OuterHades> @keyworthe You mad bruh? ohnKoji

[3:02:11] <%StaceMcGate> CRAB

[3:02:51] <zenith0111> @queequegtheater Fair enough he's more like those writers that make stuff like Gattaca, Moby Dick, and such. So if you're not a fan of themes and metaphors it will be a grind

[3:03:08] <%Maids4lyfe> you're wrong but shut up
[3:03:11] <%FrostMass22> @hoilywood_sn It's bad because Higgs' character has no depth in the game. If you want to actually know the character's motivation, you can only do it through side shit
[3:03:12] <Demon_chann> @arkv01 yes
[3:03:12] <%cureneckbeard> Dead Dadman

[3:03:38] <%derap41> @phatmac16 depends a bit on how much Pat endures but I'm guessing Pat will go all the way so 4-5 hours

[3:03:45] <Blank9> Kojima's always been bad at writing, this game has a lot of that MGS5 jeep ride energy to it.

[3:04:00] <%Keyd00d> Good line
[3:04:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> At least Kojima owns up to his metaphors...while Cage deflects and runs away so as not to offend.
[3:04:03] <+QueequegTheater> @zenith0111 No, he thinks naming a character what their theme is counts as subtext. Last time I checked Herman Melville didn't call his main character HATES WHALEMAN
[3:04:09] <%Valdorick> "Sam"
[3:04:11] <MrDonTacos_> BibleThump
[3:04:12] <+RestlessCorpse> So people think it's cheesy when an antagonist lays out his entire plan and motivation in a monologue, but NOW yer bitchin' that Higgs didn't do that, and you have to find out in a diary? Can't win.
[3:04:13] <Hellarussian> oh
[3:04:15] <%FrostMass22> Let the Legend come back to life!
[3:04:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @FrostMass22 I donty really get the critique where people can be disappointed about not learning shit if they dont do side stuff.

[3:04:54] <herfaintsmile> @RestlessCorpse or... and here's a revolutionary thought... both are bad. how about that.
[3:04:57] <%silvery_cricket> Die Hardman pulls off his mask and he was in white face the whole time

[3:08:14] <+Freelance7> I say it's better when a game gives you the capacity to theorize, then just giving you a huge twist at the end and claim you could solve it when you couldn't.

[3:11:41] <Ultimatefool> Will this actually end on order 69 LUL
[3:11:41] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat That second cool entrance is a reference to a scene in Apocalypse Now with Martin Sheen.

[3:11:51] <mikesapartment> is this an elaborate ad for Chili's
[3:11:51] <ProfessorLitmus> you can play this one straight uyp like the end fight in mgs3
[3:11:54] <%Maids4lyfe> gold bullets are good I see
[3:11:55] <%Laecerelius> THE GUN IS GOOD
[3:11:55] <%skizzuto> he wants some BB back ribs

[3:12:05] <+D00msDayDan> @PeachSaliva tell pat he can use the strand on the skeletons
[3:12:09] <%DatGuyJimbo> I love that paintball sound
[3:12:10] <cheesedburgers> Cliff gets multiple intros every time because kojima had too many ideas for scenes in which Mads is sexy and dirty he couldn’t cut it down
[3:12:10] <+Fynale> firing a piss super soaker
[3:12:10] <ALazo> Where you at... BB
[3:12:10] <%ekimthegib> Skeleton Warriors

[3:12:23] <VidulaSaix> You can
[3:12:24] <neekocheeko> yoeah you can
[3:12:25] <%marsanta> Just ban us all paige and enjoy the skeletons
[3:12:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, this boss fight did make me think of The End just a lil bit
[3:12:27] <%shootbang_exe> use the strand for some cool executions
[3:12:28] <%xcompleasedad> Paige, stop humping bones
[3:12:29] <%Laecerelius> Paige just wants herself some big, strong skeleton warriors
[3:12:29] <+LtSergei> their skulls come off
[3:12:30] <vapeking42069> quick paige is distracted spam chat
[3:12:31] <+Freelance7> You can totally stealth this section
[3:12:32] <Vertigheist> paige wants the marrow
[3:12:35] <%Meow0369> I feel like using a strand against 4 armed soldiers shooting might go poorly
[3:12:35] <waifoong98> you prob can just ignore chat during bossfights Paige
[3:12:36] <+CrowGuy> Sexy Skeleton Times
[3:12:36] <%derap41> This really is the worst sections in the game I want to go back to walking over rocks no joke
[3:12:36] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> wait, where are the other mods?
[3:12:37] <Demon_chann> @ProfessorLitmus you can actually use stealth in this part
[3:12:39] <@commanderclaw> Paige would totally be down for a scottish sex ghost if he looked like a skeleton
[3:12:39] <$FluffiTamamo> Still calling it BB. He didn’t name it so he clearly doesn’t love it.
[3:12:41] <%Niney_Who> It's apparently super easy to stealth Cliff's boss fights
[3:12:42] <%iamtrlly> Hey guys, quit being dicks to Paige mkay
[3:12:42] <%Bailey__gaming> I love the fire skeleton
[3:12:47] <%ekimthegib> Kill chat so Paige can watch skeletons
[3:12:47] <%Faustgesicht> combining a uniform fetish and skeleton fetish is a dangerous game
[3:12:48] <Demon_chann> @ProfessorLitmus like full on
[3:12:49] <%DisGuyOvahEre> @PeachSaliva i hope me saying "Nicholas Page" was not interpreted as sass
[3:12:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is Pat hunting Cliffy B
[3:12:57] <%This_is_Marco> Could just do emote only
[3:12:57] <skeletonknifefight> launch the nuclear sass
[3:12:57] <ProfessorLitmus> I knows it
[3:12:58] <+Bob_Tom> cliff has the floating umbilical cords around him
[3:13:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> jesus christ dude @derap41 really? It's like you have an aversion to fun at this point.
[3:13:00] <Ipsenscastle> @PeachSaliva If you had to choose: Pat, or Pat's skeleton?
[3:13:02] <@PeachSaliva> @disguyovahere naw, that’s funny
[3:13:04] <Jrockoni> Kill them with your decadence pat
[3:13:04] <%keyworthe> LUL
[3:13:05] <%nofestu2> When is snake going to show up?
[3:13:12] <%DatGuyJimbo> you have to kill the adds or he just mindjacks into them
[3:13:13] <ALazo> Gold bullets came from Higgs, right? What are they again?
[3:13:13] <allanmiri> Those things have really shitty aim.
[3:13:15] <+MajorCrasher> why do people dislike these sections? it's not amazing but I think they're good
[3:13:18] <%deviljhojho_> gold colored bullets or bullets made of gold?
[3:13:19] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Ipsenscastle skeletons aren't fat or balding
[3:13:23] <+Freelance7> Chiral Bullets
[3:13:23] <%Meow0369> @Zaphire_Saucypants Block and move on, you'll be happier not knowing that spoiling nerd is in here shitting it up
[3:13:26] <%DazzlingFuhrer> Historical depiction of hunting down Cliffy B to force him to finish Radical Heights
[3:13:26] <nukle0nik> these sections are cool
[3:13:27] <%Maids4lyfe> you're out of blood
[3:13:29] <SethAm_> Bullets made of chiralium I think
[3:13:31] <%Meow0369> Chapter 51
[3:13:32] <Crimpson> Would be funny if you ran into a character named Snake
[3:13:33] <%Meow0369> :(
[3:13:34] <MoulesFritz> bullets coated in piss
[3:13:34] <%skibadaa> @PeachSaliva Tell Pat to optimise his load
[3:13:34] <%MrBorisMakarov> @PeachSaliva hey peach hope you're good rooHappy
[3:13:34] <Spectatorlo_ol> I ain't call you a gold digger....
[3:13:36] <Ipsenscastle> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Pat's might be
[3:13:40] <+Evitron1> i like these sections, they don't overstay their welcome at all
[3:13:40] <%keyworthe> dont make me feel pat
[3:13:41] <zenith0111> F for Metal Gear...
[3:13:41] <+MrIntake> IT COULD'VE BEEN A THRILL :(
[3:13:42] <%StaceMcGate> Metal Gear is dead, now Snake delivers packages
[3:13:42] <%keyworthe> chrsit
[3:13:42] <+MajorCrasher> the bullets are made from choral crystals
[3:13:42] <%deviljhojho_> BB....
[3:13:42] <Demon_chann> bb
[3:13:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Everyone just ignore @derap41 , Hes just classic troll trying to get a rise out of us
[3:13:43] <SethAm_> S'what people said earlier
[3:13:44] <mikesapartment> Yeah but MGS5 is actually a video game
[3:13:44] <VidulaSaix> @MajorCrasher People get hard over hating everything about this game. I've seen names in here I've seen in other streams. They just go to DS to hate on it LUL
[3:13:44] <%cureneckbeard> Snake Solidman
[3:13:45] <Blank9> because they're a linear worse-than-uncharted-1 third person shooter section
[3:13:46] <%FrostMass22> @meow0369 Could you please stop spamming about someone you blocked
[3:13:46] <+Shadicara> This is Kojima's 'what could have been' for metal gear
[3:13:47] <+QueequegTheater> Imagine if Kojima had ever had a good editor
[3:13:48] <Vertigheist> shh let metal gear die...
[3:13:50] <coracor> BB :(
[3:13:51] <+Toblo1> @AngriestPat This stage is giving me big Kingdom Of The Flies vibes
[3:13:53] <nukle0nik> you have plenty of fucking crystals pat
[3:13:54] <+QueequegTheater> Kappa
[3:13:54] <%iamtrlly> @Ipsenscastle Obviously Pat would never allow Paige to see his skeleton so shes here for him.
[3:13:55] <marvel877> These are just The Sorrow style fights.
[3:13:57] <NotHereToStream> schuut
[3:14:01] <%Keyd00d> Chat continues to wild out
[3:14:02] <%Bailey__gaming> Oh Hai @mrborismakarov sending a hug buddy
[3:14:03] <Artista_AF> Featuring the SKULLS Ghost Unit
[3:14:05] <DRAGKUDO> wait which war was Boss in/
[3:14:06] <KeystoneA1> Imagine an MGS3 remake with Fox engine or this game engine; that fucking pachinko machine doesn't count.
[3:14:06] <%ekimthegib> Make sure pat doesn't bleed out with bullets
[3:14:10] <%shootbang_exe> would snake be sneakkillman?
[3:14:10] <NotHereToStream> boss was in ww2
[3:14:10] <%Faustgesicht> I'm honestly surprised there hasn;t been a MGS reference here by now
[3:14:12] <+코코꾸라> guerrilla tactics PogChamp
[3:14:13] <%StaceMcGate> Atmosphere is great, but combat gameplay is bad.....
[3:14:15] <+MrIntake> i just want kojima to make a mech game, he knows we are waiting
[3:14:15] <Djinnazz> @angriestpat Is Pat actually using a recourse gun?? Has the goblin been defeated?
[3:14:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DRAGKUDO ww2
[3:14:17] <%Laecerelius> Pat, why you only play BB games?! Why you no shuut?!
[3:14:20] <ALazo> Really, they could make bullets out of those crystals, but the first time a BT was killed they used Sam's fluids for it?
[3:14:23] <%derap41> I for real don't think the gun play in this game is good but I enjoyed the travel and transport aspect that isn't being disingenous or "trolly"
[3:14:23] <superd4v3> @DRAGKUDO The Boss ir Big Boss?
[3:14:26] <%ekimthegib> It's all good actually
[3:14:27] <+Imn0tacop> I feel like this game is a big Metalgear/silent hills rolled into one as a fuk u from Kojima.
[3:14:28] <MoulesFritz> pat show femur
[3:14:30] <Kghaleon> Grenades+Bullets just melts him
[3:14:31] <%DatGuyJimbo> I wonder where Sam is? not the cargo coming out of the bushes
[3:14:33] <artoflec> it basically has the same problems that the new pokemon does. Stuff should be exciting and fun, it's not.
[3:14:34] <DRAGKUDO> The boss
[3:14:34] <+Dragon4234> @majorcrasher because there done three times and aren’t interesting once you get past the spectacle?
[3:14:35] <Vertigheist> how do kill a boner trooper
[3:14:35] <%MrBorisMakarov> @Bailey__gaming rooHug Hope you're doing good
[3:14:35] <nukle0nik> ok waste your bullets on the only rifle that can shoot gold bullets
[3:14:36] <katocrimson> blood and gold
[3:14:38] <+dredayy56> No more for metal gear. It's eaither pachinko or cavity searches
[3:14:38] <%DazzlingFuhrer> I really would've preferred die-hardbaby.
[3:14:40] <fairore> @mrintake Zoe 3?
[3:14:40] <Hellarussian> BIG blind
[3:14:41] <ProfessorLitmus> if you dipped a pig in chiridium and the roasted it would that mean you made chiral ham?
[3:14:42] <%AbnormalVoid> he's going into Dangerous President mode
[3:14:51] <tr00ly_> fart haha
[3:14:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he currently has teh BLOOD bullets equipped
[3:14:54] <superd4v3> @DRAGKUDO K, The Boss fought in WW2, Big Boss in 'Nam
[3:14:58] <%I_need_pants> Pat I won't blame you for putting the game on very easy for this part. its what I did apatJpeg
[3:15:00] <zenith0111> We just want Silent Hill and Metal Gear again :(
[3:15:02] <%ekimthegib> As someone who doesn't like survival horror, I'm kind of glad this game got made instead of Hills
[3:15:04] <%StaceMcGate> If only Volgin could show up rightnow
[3:15:06] <%Bailey__gaming> @mrborismakarov much better the last few days, thank you <3
[3:15:13] <Spectatorlo_ol> Did you know bullets are faster than Laser?
[3:15:13] <%Valdorick> Cliff... why does your aim suck so hard?
[3:15:15] <DRAGKUDO> shofuScheme good
[3:15:17] <Nested_Dreams> !uptime
[3:15:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 15m.
[3:15:19] <%Meow0369> @ekimthegib Same, I love horror but it spooks me too much
[3:15:23] <%MrBorisMakarov> no problem at all that's great to hear <3 @Bailey__gaming
[3:15:23] <%Soulbishop> That does not look like a bt whale
[3:15:24] <%Faustgesicht> Is Mads just gonna grab Sam's dick out of nowhere? That'd be neat
[3:15:26] <nukle0nik> your gun is out
[3:15:29] <Nested_Dreams> :<
[3:15:31] <NeroInfinite> Why is there a whale innam
[3:15:34] <nukle0nik> just use the chiral guns :v
[3:15:38] <%ekimthegib> @Meow0369 <3
[3:15:40] <%Keyd00d> I would totally swap to the timeline Silent Hills got made. i like this game too tho
[3:15:41] <%Meow0369> Drop empty guns
[3:15:43] <ALazo> For an eternal soldier kinda guy, he seems kind of ineffectual
[3:15:47] <%Laecerelius> normal-ass guns
[3:15:47] <fairore> @dragkudo who emote is that?
[3:15:48] <%shootbang_exe> you can totally stealth this section
[3:15:54] <%derap41> @NeroInfinite its not really nam is the idea of nam
[3:15:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah you can!
[3:15:57] <%shootbang_exe> if you wanna try it
[3:15:59] <MrDonTacos_> Hey Paige if someone took Pat away from you would you create a skeleton army to get him back?
[3:16:05] <NeroInfinite> Oh.
[3:16:06] <Crimpson> Tango
[3:16:12] <%StaceMcGate> Tango Down
[3:16:13] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> kimi mi to
[3:16:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> stealth was super satisfying for me in this battlefield setting
[3:16:14] <Hellarussian> Waltz
[3:16:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Holy shit, if you shoot thru tall grass, itll literally cut the grass in front of you
[3:16:19] <%Bailey__gaming> @mrborismakarov I hope you had a nice thanksgiving if you were celebrating.
[3:16:19] <neekocheeko> tango sucka!
[3:16:20] <zenith0111> @alazo The boss fights are way better on hard
[3:16:21] <+QueequegTheater> @MrDonTacos_ She would make skeletons purely to have the skeletons
[3:16:24] <DRAGKUDO> Shofu's
[3:16:26] <%deviljhojho_> the bb
[3:16:26] <@PeachSaliva> @mrdontacos_ Nobody takes my Paddy away without me making skeletons.
[3:16:27] <Blank9> if paige had a skeleton army, do you think she'd need pat?
[3:16:29] <ataxia72> yeah the stealth here on hard mode was really good
[3:16:30] <Shwepie> @MrDonTacos_ She would replace him with a skeleton.
[3:16:33] <%Keyd00d> Yeah I preferred stealthing thi one
[3:16:36] <Kghaleon> The AI in this game is pretty bad, tbh
[3:16:43] <+Freelance7> @peachsaliva WHat is Pat is a skeleton?
[3:16:44] <NotHereToStream> true
[3:16:46] <+Freelance7> *if
[3:16:48] <eco419> Awww cute
[3:16:49] <MrDonTacos_> NICE 😄
[3:16:49] <OToole42> you guys keep saying skeleton army, you mean skeleton harem
[3:16:56] <%shootbang_exe> would paige be cliff, who summons and fights with skeletons, or higgs who cosplays skeletons?
[3:16:57] <%Meow0369> To be fair these are weird ghost things, it's not like they should act like normal people
[3:16:57] <Thepothero> xxxSHH no BB here
[3:16:58] <%xcompleasedad> These sections are SO fucked
[3:16:59] <+Jaysky> Jesus Pat just give him his BB already
[3:16:59] <%ekimthegib> It can be both
[3:17:02] <%shootbang_exe> that's the real question
[3:17:05] <+QueequegTheater> What a talented soldier Cliff is Kappa
[3:17:07] <%Laecerelius> Big bad special forces man can't handle UPS badass
[3:17:09] <%Faustgesicht> Harem army
[3:17:11] <%MrBorisMakarov> @Bailey__gaming unfortunately I've been working that retail grind yesterday and today :( but it honestly wasn't too bad only a few rough apples ;)
[3:17:13] <tr00ly_> delivery man better soldier than trained marine..
[3:17:15] <%bevyrage> yeah there's no way she'd have a skeleton army. harem is more appropriate given it wouldn't be organized
[3:17:15] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what if Cliff accidently shot his BB?
[3:17:17] <+Simketh> "Making Skeletons" sounds like a gross new bodily function
[3:17:18] <+machshop> he wants his baby back baby back
[3:17:18] <%ekimthegib> Stealthy
[3:17:19] <artoflec> there have been non human enemies in games with better AI before. There's no excuse.
[3:17:19] <allanmiri> How was BB formed?
[3:17:19] <eco419> Skeletons Kreygasm
[3:17:21] <%Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva do you have a list of top 10 skeletons?
[3:17:21] <+MechaBaphomet> This just makes me wish it was a metal gear game
[3:17:25] <%Meow0369> Let's not forget that sam is literally invincible
[3:17:27] <nukle0nik> you're walking past a guy
[3:17:34] <ProfessorLitmus> she already has a skeleton army she just makes them all wear col dude shirts and pose in place all day
[3:17:35] <blackesteagle> dafaq, now in NAM after ww2?
[3:17:36] <%Meow0369> Repatriate all day every day
[3:17:36] <Ipsenscastle> @Simketh brb gotta make some skeletons
[3:17:36] <zenith0111> @allanmiri They answered that like 5 chapters ago
[3:17:38] <%ekimthegib> "what is that tower of boxes over there in the grass?"
[3:17:39] <%miguelrod777> eternal warriors vs ups man
[3:17:45] <Demon_chann> i mean if you have a kids dont you literally make a skeleton
[3:17:50] <%StaceMcGate> Camo Index: 100%

[3:52:23] <+jake_protagonist> you mean the reviewers who hated this game. I wonder
[3:52:23] <TafferAA> thats not possible
[3:52:23] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat NPCs
[3:52:24] <superchronicc> it wouldve been more helpful to run the speed skeleton instead
[3:52:25] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> he played on easy
[3:52:26] <+boki_86> you mean the reviewers
[3:52:27] <+Edrem> kojima staff would have filled some things in

[3:52:32] <%cureneckbeard> apatGoblin sipsipGoblin
[3:52:32] <%FrostMass22> Is there a point to getting crystals at this point? Isn't crafting turned off?
[3:52:33] <%SvenHolgersson> Just like his daddy

[3:52:37] <corpsegoo> ziplines don't actually enable full skippage, it'll pull you off the zipline and force the encounter
[3:52:38] <Crimpson> I am sure that these were all made by NPC's
[3:52:40] <+QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I'll tell you when I play it because I'm going to play it offline
[3:52:41] <%Rumbutt> Seems similar to what the first person to get ending E in Autotomato would've had to deal with
[3:52:41] <%cureneckbeard> apatGib apatGoblin
[3:52:42] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat NPCs like how the tutorial has NPC coonstructions
[3:52:42] <+Bob_Tom> @AngriestPat it's just YOUR structures, not all players, so probably not that bad entirely
[3:52:42] <Louie_Salmon> It's probably an Automata situation where there was like some dev things
[3:52:45] <scottishwolf> Pat for the love of god your container is going to break
[3:52:46] <DmoTraz> its all stuff from the beginning of the game so not that bad lmao

[3:53:38] <+QueequegTheater> @ekimthegib I just hate enforced multiplayer. Same reason I hate certain Dark Souls 3 bosses that are clearly balanced for 3-4 players
[3:53:39] <cheesedburgers> He has a cover on it it should be ok right
[3:53:40] <DmoTraz> its the backpack cover lol

[3:55:41] <neekocheeko> yeah the all terrain skelli is op
[3:55:43] <$realm_forge> That doesn’t look like the area where a truck explosion juggled you down a mountainside
[3:55:44] <%derap41> This was a really cool part of the game
[3:55:45] <Garry_Guyface> Scientifically made for running on goo!
[3:55:45] <+Freelance7> PAT HAD A VOIDOUT?
[3:55:45] <%razielhex> having to pewe increases running speed
[3:55:47] <waifoong98> jesus christ
[3:55:48] <mikesapartment> Nice shame marker
[3:55:49] <%ekimthegib> that's a big handprint

[3:55:53] <%Animorphimagi> duh
[3:55:54] <nukle0nik> i beat the game without ever seeing the voidout
[3:55:54] <DmoTraz> theres a giant handprinit in that crater BTW
[3:55:55] <scottishwolf> I never realised just how crazy the voidout craters were
[3:55:59] <NotHereToStream> ghosts mad
[3:56:00] <%Valdorick> NON-PERFECT GAME! Kojima is saddened
[3:56:02] <%netrac> I thought that would regen over time
[3:56:02] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @PeachSaliva are we there yet?
[3:56:03] <vicious_rage> "can't catch me i'm the gingerbread pat!"
[3:56:03] <Run44forrest> D: thats what a voidout looks like
[3:56:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> same @nukle0nik
[3:56:05] <%Mekhet09> You'd have out speed him on speed skeleton and never gotten in the goo
[3:56:09] <%StaceMcGate> Does the game limit the number of voidouts you can have?
[3:56:13] <+Nanocomputer> @nukle0nik Thas Pat's personal viod out
[3:56:14] <VidulaSaix> No
[3:56:14] <Crimpson> I void out by the windmil building lol
[3:56:16] <Delenay> i wonder if you can just destroy the map in voidouts
[3:56:17] <scottishwolf> >TFW was panicking about the cargo when it was just the cover. SHIT
[3:56:18] <waifoong98> @Valdorick S rank goes down
[3:56:20] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @nukle0nik pats just big dumbo LUL
[3:56:20] <VidulaSaix> You can
[3:56:22] <%ekimthegib> Take me home, country roads
[3:56:22] <+Nanocomputer> he legit died there
[3:56:29] <eco419> Is actually helping him making it a good void out
[3:56:29] <phatmac16> Can you void out most of the map
[3:56:30] <nukle0nik> made big boom boom
[3:56:31] <%derap41> @Delenay You can sure make a mess of it
[3:56:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh the cover's gone
[3:56:33] <%GarbageNirvana> I saw only one voidout in my game and it was the spot where you had to cross the tar
[3:56:36] <OuterHades> Please save
[3:56:37] <Delenay> can you layer them on top of each other
[3:56:39] <Hellarussian> does Elmo have DOOMs?
[3:56:46] <%StaceMcGate> Can you use voidouts to destroy facilities?
[3:56:46] <Kghaleon> I got attacked by like 4-5 of those giant BT wolfs at the same time on my way through this map.
[3:56:46] <Delenay> and just void out to the center of the earth
[3:56:47] <%theAncopro> i havent voidout yet because i usually load back when shit hits the fan
[3:56:50] <Crimpson> Right into one
[3:56:51] <Louie_Salmon> Well technically the perfect playthrough would have one voidout just to see it
[3:56:52] <Aydarkzero> not gonna lie mules are kind of a joke
[3:56:53] <Ipsenscastle> SCARY ELDRITCH SKY
[3:56:54] <+RestlessCorpse> You actually have to try really hard to get a voidout, I'm impressed.
[3:56:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> not in MULE territory
[3:57:05] <zenith0111> @stacemcgate That's a game over
[3:57:08] <%DatGuyJimbo> these are the baby shit mules
[3:57:08] <IndoorSitup> WUBBA WUBBA I'M IN THE PINL
[3:57:09] <agumon9000> THOSE ARE NOT MULES THEY ARE TERRORISTS
[3:57:10] <karl_rex> What happened to all the roads and stuff?
[3:57:11] <coracor> don't you mules have anything better to do
[3:57:12] <waifoong98> ah yes, freaking RESINS
[3:57:12] <+berserker_103> played the game for 60h and didn't know that voidouts stays in the map
[3:57:15] <beetbo2> MULES NEVER DIE
[3:57:15] <IndoorSitup> FUCK

[3:57:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> MULES get better as you get more equipment
[3:57:31] <DmoTraz> did he kill someone?
[3:57:31] <eco419> Pew pew

[3:57:36] <%DatGuyJimbo> bag cover is kill
[3:57:39] <%StaceMcGate> Homo Demens still trying to burn the world I see
[3:57:40] <SethAm_> Repatriates still void out if a BT eats them
[3:57:40] <%marsanta> Postman Pat and his black and white cat successful again!
[3:57:42] <nukle0nik> you still voidout if the BTs get you as a repatraite
[3:57:42] <+BadTastingPoison> @DmoTraz BT ate him
[3:57:42] <alwayspronking> Can MULES drown?
[3:57:43] <%razielhex> @DmoTraz Non-lethal.
[3:57:44] <Crimpson> They aren't even going to you
[3:57:44] <SethAm_> They can just come back after the fact
[3:57:45] <%theAncopro> Mules don't give a fuk about the end of the world
[3:57:45] <%Meow0369> @DmoTraz Repatriatesstill void out, they just coime back
[3:57:45] <%afronooch> @DmoTraz BT eating Sam causes voidout
[3:57:49] <DmoTraz> really
[3:57:49] <+Nanocomputer> @DmoTraz Got lost to the BT boss
[3:57:52] <agumon9000> @DmoTraz Voidouts only happen if a BT eats you. So repatraites can still voidout
[3:57:53] <+Nanocomputer> he*
[3:57:57] <%FrostMass22> @dmotraz Sam can still make a voidout, it's just that he comes back anyway.
[3:57:59] <%DedlokPM> @wydamn by using rubber pellets or beanbags
[3:57:59] <Ipsenscastle> Terra doesn't have to be spelled with ORIST

[5:02:25] <NinjaTB> Finkle is Reinhorn! Reinhorn is Finkle! Reinhorn is a man!
[5:02:26] <%FrostMass22> The weirdest part so far is that Amelie didn't know she was a cosmic entity
[5:02:27] <Twistedwolfie> SURE DOES
[5:02:27] <VirtuaRailith> you haven't started the 2 hour movie yet
[5:02:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IT GETS BETTER I PROMISE

[5:02:36] <%Animorphimagi> best cutscenes in 15 minutes
[5:02:36] <+freezydude> Gee its almost like kojima without a leash is terrible even if the konami leash was also terrible
[5:02:36] <%FrostMass22> How did Amelie figure out she was an EE?
[5:02:37] <Aydarkzero> Roxas! Nobodies Heartless you all thought!
[5:02:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> What we've learned is that Bridget has TERRIBLE naming sense. America AmeLie

[5:02:42] <%ekimthegib> All tuckered out
[5:02:42] <%umbypokochan> i feel like Kojima read a bunch of bad creepypastas when making this
[5:02:42] <coracor> What the fuck
[5:02:42] <+krawtch> hideous kojima everybody
[5:02:43] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat remember how MGS was boring as fuck? well, I sure don't

[5:02:56] <waifoong98> no it doesn't LUL
[5:02:57] <%DedlokPM> @necrocannibal2 Right, but like I said, story wise this is the same as what Kojima has always doen. And I guarantee I have read something with Kojima said he probably would have taken guns out of MGS a long time ago if it weren't for publisher insistence it be there "to sell units"
[5:02:57] <$arcielardor> he's in a monster-deprived psychotic state!!
[5:02:58] <%ekimthegib> This is good isn't it?
[5:02:59] <SpellCatty> KAIRIIII
[5:02:59] <phatmac16> HACK KOJMBO
[5:03:00] <%FrostMass22> Here's a question: how doed anyone know what an EE is?
[5:03:00] <+krawtch> "no, this is the way you should go"
[5:03:00] <mankeytennis> Namine
[5:03:01] <korth367> wat

[5:03:01] <%Animorphimagi> NOPE
[5:03:02] <%edgeyberzerker> keep yelling pat
[5:03:02] <Aydarkzero> Kairi's a princess?
[5:03:02] <Dragovus> The wall does nothing
[5:03:03] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Big Brain JoJimBOB
[5:03:03] <%netrac> YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FROM CROSSING FATE
[5:03:06] <+RestlessCorpse> Hitting the wall makes it take LONGER because you have to watch the repositioning "cutscene"
[5:03:06] <herfaintsmile> i am lord voldemort i guess
[5:03:08] <%Owkono> cant wait for kojima to make a movie, lol
[5:03:08] <%Strider222> stop running to the back it will just take longer
[5:03:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> If shes his sister why is she a cosmic space entity and not him?
[5:03:08] <ataxia72> keep calling. pat
[5:03:08] <+Andrizzleton> why not run to the water??
[5:03:09] <%SaiyanShoto> You will watch our credits and like it!
[5:03:09] <+Edrem> it just teleports you back
[5:03:09] <Maverick2736> THE ULTIMATE ENDING: AN ANVILICIOUS INFODUMP
[5:03:10] <+allups> this is the shit no one lieks in games
[5:03:12] <seainspace> yell
[5:03:12] <%derap41> You know what creates intrigue? Mysteries you know what doesn't create intrigue? Explain every fucking facet and motivation of your character in monolouge after the fucking game is done
[5:03:13] <%Animorphimagi> @fragdar he's dead
[5:03:14] <coracor> scream to the heavens
[5:03:14] <Frozilla15> I didn't know David Cage produced this
[5:03:16] <$realm_forge> Only the ingredients on monster energy kept the final stranding at bay
[5:03:17] <Grennold> "btw I killed your parents Raiden 4Head "
[5:03:17] <TundraOW> CAN'T ESCAPE FROM CROSSING FASTE
[5:03:18] <+jake_protagonist> It really ruins the mystical and scary part of the game when they reveal the cause is just some bitch was impatient
[5:03:19] <%reddpop_> "I've ... been having these weird dreams lately "
[5:03:19] <Run44forrest> is this just devilman? ResidentSleeper
[5:03:21] <%DisGuyOvahEre> climb the mountain
[5:03:21] <Namillus> So in Egyptian religion one's Ha is your body and your Ka is your soul. There are other soul components - Ba is your Personality, for instance - but those two are the most important.
[5:03:22] <JoshTheFace> yeah this part sucks
[5:03:22] <%Meow0369> Ahh well pats gonna mis some funny callouts
[5:03:23] <+Jaysky> Chat is Fragile fragile or not fragile?
[5:03:23] <Cdjgamer> coxSeafood coxSoup
[5:03:25] <Ipsenscastle> this is just garbage now
[5:03:26] <HoIlywood_SN> @derap41 the game is not done
[5:03:27] <fragdar> oh..
[5:03:27] <hansomeataru> yes, skip gameplay please
[5:03:27] <VigilantShield> so couldn't you just stand still and wait?
[5:03:28] <Nina96> hes dead
[5:03:28] <rytisone> put on some dmc music Kojima
[5:03:29] <%ekimthegib> Cause it looks cool
[5:03:30] <Crimpson> i'm blue aba di aba die
[5:03:31] <Elsewize> What's the gun for?
[5:03:31] <+earthboy2k> KAIRI IS PART OF THE DARKNESS NOW
[5:03:32] <%I_need_pants> Might as well put controller down
[5:03:32] <$arcielardor> no monster =final stranding!!
[5:03:33] <%afronooch> not his beach
[5:03:34] <Gabbycat> Cuz he's dead maybe
[5:03:34] <+jake_protagonist> I THINk it's her beach
[5:03:35] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> it's still not over?
[5:03:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> So if you ended up being two people would one of them be Reedan Normus?
[5:03:35] <+Akabane101> That means he's dead. Like in the flashback with Heartman and his family.
[5:03:36] <SpellCatty> KAAA MEEEE
[5:03:36] <+DiabloDeAzul> You'll know why soon enough
[5:03:37] <%Strider222> this should be on ride with norman reedus on AMC
[5:03:38] <phatmac16> WRITTEN BY DAVID CAGE
[5:03:39] <42nfl19> what's the point of running around? Does it make the credits progresss?
[5:03:39] <SSBBfan666> @AngriestPat he's trapped in the Beach
[5:03:39] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> cuz its sad and blue is sad
[5:03:40] <%FrostMass22> @jaysky She's fragile but not that fragile
[5:03:40] <Delenay> cant run into the water?
[5:03:41] <marvel877> You mean like Heartman was on his beach, Pat?
[5:03:41] <Aydarkzero> @Jaysky not that fragile Kappa
[5:03:42] <Kongro_> Because he's dead inside
[5:03:42] <tr00ly_> lionSleep1 lionSleep2
[5:03:42] <+Imn0tacop> Is he on his own beach?
[5:03:42] <l3ffectsl> CUZ HE DIED WITH HIS MOM IN HIS ARMS NOW HES DEATH STRANDED
[5:03:43] <%Valdorick> Sam got Norted!?
[5:03:43] <Louie_Salmon> You see Sam, "Sa" is a greek word meaning "connection", and "m" is like Mario, because she is your princess beach.
[5:03:43] <+krawtch> on the beach of exposition, we are all desaturated
[5:03:43] <%Keyd00d> one sucky part but the rest is good
[5:03:44] <+zanzibar_junker> You still have a delivery after this
[5:03:45] <%JellyT89> Blue is dead, just like Heartman before he revived
[5:03:45] <%DatGuyJimbo> he's in limbo
[5:03:45] <%derap41> @HoIlywood_SN I know its not done trust me I know
[5:03:45] <startstoprepeat> i think the intention is to show you what amelie meant when she said she ended it all because she was bored, but ehhhhh
[5:03:45] <Crimpson> You are in Purgatory
[5:03:47] <%Solidus_113> It's titled Sam's Beach
[5:03:47] <+bubbli97> they could've just made this a monologue while the credits roll, instead you have to run around just to do smth and waste minutes
[5:03:47] <Dragovus> Are we the dead one?

[5:04:06] <Manwad> I don't get the issue with names like that. Meaningful names is a thing that many peeps do, liker how Bioshock's main dude, Andrew Ryan, is named after Ayn Rand.

[5:05:18] <DmoTraz> @VidulaSaix got it on the nose
[5:05:18] <SSBBfan666> @AngriestPat Sam is reflecting what Amelie explained to him with that fade to black before he made his choice.
[5:05:19] <+necrocannibal2> @DedlokPM I understand what you're saying. also, I just find the military/political themes of MGS more entertaining in general than this.
[5:05:19] <%Animorphimagi> she didn't know anything Pat
[5:05:21] <%1kenny30> ROUTE YOUR WIFI THROUGH THE GHOST DIMENSION!
[5:05:21] <Aydarkzero> your packets will never reach the truth!

[5:05:39] <+earthboy2k> Kojima is a terrible writer
[5:05:39] <VirtuaRailith> Stadia causes the death stranding
[5:05:40] <%Keyd00d> no she didn't
[5:05:43] <Namillus> The thing is, having your Ka and Ha split is REALLY BAD because your Ha is supposed to carry your Ka into the afterlife
[5:05:44] <phatmac16> She was trying to save the world
[5:05:45] <hansomeataru> THIS NEVER ENDS
[5:05:48] <Run44forrest> wait so why did we build the network?
[5:05:48] <%deviljhojho_> haHAA
[5:05:49] <%BlueMoonBlues> HA
[5:05:49] <%Strider222> HA KA

[5:05:52] <%ekimthegib> Cancer, HA
[5:05:54] <vaderxyz1970> She's Gendo!
[5:05:54] <Ipsenscastle> If you have to explain your story this much, while literally nothing else happens, your story is fucking junk
[5:05:54] <+loukemia83> mostly climate change or meteors
[5:05:55] <waifoong98> it's always cancer Kappa
[5:05:55] <$Dakuu75> "my Ha" what?
[5:05:57] <morningmoondude> "How do I stop my house from catching fire? I must set it on fire to find that answer."
[5:05:57] <%netrac> It was nibiru kojima?
[5:05:59] <l3ffectsl> MOM DIES ;/

[5:06:13] <VidulaSaix> We built the network because she wanted to speed up the extinction so humanity didnt have to suffer through the long death
[5:06:13] <HoIlywood_SN> Ha and Ka are Egyptian terms or some shit, body and soul
[5:06:13] <%ekimthegib> Ka is soul

[5:06:43] <Aydarkzero> that sounds cool
[5:06:43] <SetsuRyuu> in my dreams I kinda see everything desaturated too, so I guess Kojima must dream like that too so he did these colors for Sam's beach (?)
[5:06:45] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Zaphire_Saucypants why does this lady have such a huge boner for Egypt?

[5:07:01] <Namillus> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Kojima has the Egyptboner
[5:07:02] <agumon9000> The Chiral Network didn't cause the Last Stranding. Her very existence is the last stranding. The network allowed her to sever herself from the beach and keep the connected beaches of the network.
[5:07:02] <%Laecerelius> CHAAAAOOOOS!

[5:08:12] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Imagine a dinosaur or velociraptor EE trying to explain all this shit to you
[5:08:12] <vaderxyz1970> Modern problems require modern solutions
[5:08:12] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Well Rats are super smart
[5:08:12] <SvenHolgersson> NO IT IS NOT

[5:08:15] <Arkus187> Hey Pat, I hope that you make a spoilercst with Woolie about this game.
[5:08:16] <SSBBfan666> the fuck is Homestuck?
[5:08:16] <+Ilpala> HOMESTUCK MADE MORE SENSE THAN THIS
[5:08:16] <+jake_protagonist> Listen Pat Kojima read a history book once. Once.
[5:08:16] <korth367> dinos are ded now cus they arent smrt
[5:08:16] <+necrocannibal2> IT'S LIKE NO SENTENCE HAS ANY CONNECTION TO THE PREVIOUS ONE
[5:08:16] <bomfiz> cause they can deal with the cold :)
[5:08:17] <Picosunloaded> I mean they kind of are they can drive cars pat
[5:08:17] <%netrac> only if you fuck up and don't kill everyone
[5:08:17] <+LtSergei> they evolved into humans you dip
[5:08:17] <narusao> GENIUS!
[5:08:17] <phatmac16> BRAVO KOJUMBO
[5:08:17] <%Madbearv> yea, this isn't how any of this works
[5:08:18] <DmoTraz> @AngriestPat because they survived and the dinosaurs didnt
[5:08:18] <%This_is_Marco> the rats make rockets to go to space
[5:08:19] <%dreamfillah> Because MAMMALS man
[5:08:19] <haisho> I'm pretty sure extinction means EVERYBODY DEAD
[5:08:19] <%Niney_Who> Death Stranding is just AntiSpirals then?
[5:08:19] <%ekimthegib> It was a death stranding, not meteors
[5:08:20] <Illiobillium> they talked about this in the lore you didn't read, Pat.
[5:08:20] <+ArcLifth> Are there any dinosaurs anymore pat?
[5:08:21] <%roxikat> Elmo evolved to be fluffy and strong
[5:08:22] <red_blaster> THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING
[5:08:22] <%DisGuyOvahEre> CLIMB MOUNTAIN

[5:08:25] <Ipsenscastle> THE BIG RATS MAKE ALL THE RULES PAT
[5:08:25] <SvenHolgersson> GO IN THE WATER
[5:08:25] <%Animorphimagi> they could adapt Pat
[5:08:26] <srkAres> i hear it. its kojima fapping
[5:08:26] <SolverCODO> I think it's an opportunity for whatever comes in the afterlife
[5:08:27] <+krawtch> turns out the thing I liked about Metal Gear was Kojima's Editor
[5:08:28] <BunnyEmperor> MAKE EXTINCTION NOT LOVE
[5:08:28] <seainspace> yell
[5:08:28] <%wannabemoogle> Kojima misses his mom
[5:08:29] <Grennold> Pat being Pat again 4Head
[5:08:29] <Heartless_01> how does evolution work
[5:08:29] <Vertigheist> It gets rid of humans, sounds good to me
[5:08:29] <%This_is_Marco> She's saying words
[5:08:29] <AliceAstro> EXTINCTION IS GOOD FOR MORALE
[5:08:30] <haisho> because Dodos are pretty damn extinct
[5:08:30] <Dragovus> I really wish we could use that gun to shoot this bitch
[5:08:32] <%oceanmatt> bunch of kojimbo jumbo
[5:08:32] <The_Whispered_One> Well, everything died, but I guess well take this arbitrary annihilation of everything weve ever known for no reason as a learning experience
[5:08:32] <Tunykun> I'm ready to hear more French
[5:08:32] <%reddpop_> she's trying to make up her mind
[5:08:33] <%cureneckbeard> Plot Dumpman
[5:08:33] <herfaintsmile> she's a fucking sociopath
[5:08:34] <Artista_AF> Dinosaurs put pinneapple on Pizza

[5:08:36] <+Caped_Eggy> We are the rats pat
[5:08:37] <Crimpson> She is explaining what her purpose is
[5:08:38] <allanmiri> So this is why people were making the Evagelion comparisons earlier.
[5:08:39] <Zombrocom> This is fucking nonsense
[5:08:40] <narusao> it all makes perfect sense now!
[5:08:40] <+jiggy_snipe> this is Gurren Lagaan and Eva and some other bs
[5:08:40] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat how's he liking the game?
[5:08:41] <%medusasghost> extinction is literally the opposite of an opportunity
[5:08:41] <%razielhex> Skaven are better than man-things at kill-maiming and dig-scratching
[5:08:41] <+PanicSwytch> I think shes trying to force evolution or adaptation
[5:08:41] <HyperBomb21> This is all filler information
[5:08:42] <bleugh> let's watch the credits some more
[5:08:42] <+Jaysky> She's saying hyperbolic deep shit
[5:08:42] <Vertigheist> Pat dinosaurs turned into birds
[5:08:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> BEATINGS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL MORALE IMPROVES
[5:08:43] <Monkey_D_Judd> If the Dinosaurs were so smart HOW COME THEY'RE DEAD?
[5:08:43] <Psykoknight65> she literally just said that world ending events cause the world to evolve
[5:08:44] <+earthboy2k> IM A DUMB AMERICAN PLEASE HELP

[5:08:44] <bahamut1010> I think it's official, YOKO TARO > KOJIMA

[5:09:07] <%Meow0369> SHE WAS ALWAYS an EE, AND a person
[5:09:08] <%deviljhojho_> Perhaps crikObject

[5:09:09] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat i think she was describing evolution
[5:09:09] <%netrac> you could say that is a giant broken window fallacy
[5:09:10] <Nina96> its stupif
[5:09:11] <%dave323dave> she was a person I think?
[5:09:11] <Illiobillium> Pat the egyptian gods were people before they were gods.

[5:09:13] <zenith0111> BUT NOW SHE'S AN ELDRITCH GOD
[5:09:13] <+BoomerTiro> Pat, she has a split personality in conflict with itself. One half wants to destroy everything, one half wants to save it all, and the more you take actions to put her together the more obvious the conflict becomes
[5:09:13] <%Valdorick> I think Kokima might be taking the piss.
[5:09:13] <nicks220> she is an entity that has a human personality
[5:09:13] <%derap41> Pat is correct
[5:09:13] <MoulesFritz> this is stupid and boring
[5:09:13] <shiny_prinny> yes
[5:09:13] <Garry_Guyface> Game Theory: Does Amelie be Otocon's Sister?????

[5:09:14] <TheBlankAce> She knows what an EE is what are you talking about
[5:09:15] <l3ffectsl> SHES WAS A PERSON, BUT SHE WAS ALSO AN EE! LIKE MAMA WAS A PERSON BUT ALSO A PART OF ANOTHER BEING
[5:09:15] <Manwad> She's a warlock. That's her deal, she dug too deep into the beach and became a warlock to the beach.
[5:09:16] <ape_hawk> ITS FUCKING STUPID
[5:09:16] <%Tahstachio> it dumb
[5:09:16] <%SaiyanShoto> Go back in time and kill baby her

[5:09:20] <+remagoediv> One vote for stupid
[5:09:20] <coracor> it's stupid but pat is being intentionally dense
[5:09:20] <morningmoondude> she's more of a facsimile
[5:09:21] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Genocide is a good thing- Bridget, probably
[5:09:21] <%reddpop_> this is the dumbest its ever been
[5:09:21] <Run44forrest> IM GONNA START LITTERING
[5:09:22] <+D00msDayDan> yeah it's stupid
[5:09:22] <Novillion> Possibly a lot of it is stupid
[5:09:22] <+Freelance7> IT'S AMAZING
[5:09:22] <HoIlywood_SN> i think it was Evolution, pat, she was describing Evolution
[5:09:23] <MSN04_Sazabi> SHE ONLY FIRST SAW THE BEACH IN HER 20s SHE'S A PERSON
[5:09:24] <Ipsenscastle> it's stupid
[5:09:24] <%Meow0369> EXACTLY
[5:09:25] <+Imn0tacop> Np, she's a regular person like Rei is a regular person, pat.

[5:09:34] <ramphs> BECAUSE SHE IS HUMAN
[5:09:34] <Basch71> Paige gets it

[5:09:40] <agumon9000> Paige is right
[5:09:41] <%chiluzza> Paige is right
[5:09:41] <+Freelance7> PAige is right
[5:09:41] <Namillus> So Amelie wasn't trying to blow up the world, she was trying to avoid killing everybody and the backlash against her breaking her nature is what's causing the Last Stranding
[5:09:42] <l3ffectsl> AT THIS POINT SHE IS DEAD
[5:09:42] <nukle0nik> like pat, can you help breathing in air?
[5:09:42] <AliceAstro> paige is right
[5:09:42] <BluBox> Pat can't help that he is a small man :)

[5:09:45] <HellsCherry> paige is right.
[5:09:45] <StarlingSilence> it's in her nature to kill everything, but she isn't happy about it

[5:09:48] <Gabbycat> Pat stop taking things so damn literally omfg
[5:09:48] <+necrocannibal2> Paige is right but the game is wrong, if that makes sense
[5:09:48] <+Imn0tacop> Np, she's a regular person like Rei is a regular person.
[5:09:48] <%Zulrez> pat she was always an "entity", she just took the form of a human
[5:09:48] <+Akabane101> Paige is 100% right.

[5:09:52] <42nfl19> Paige is right
[5:09:53] <rada_victor> god pat is dumb
[5:09:54] <OuterHades> Paige is right
[5:09:54] <Crimpson> She grew a conscience
[5:09:54] <%Meow0369> It's her existence, but she likes reality
[5:09:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Its her nindo
[5:09:56] <%ArtemisCroc> she's a person but she can't help her nature
[5:09:56] <Grennold> Pat super smert 4Head
[5:09:56] <waifoong98> Boy Pat is gonna really hate Saya no Uta LUL
[5:09:57] <Illiobillium> It's like how biblical angels are intelligent and know things BUT they can't break out of their purpose because they don't have free will.
[5:09:57] <bleugh> are we the entities
[5:09:57] <Deimos002> Pat dumb, Paige smart

[5:09:58] <beetbo2> just reakin wait Pat
[5:09:58] <%derap41> Paige are you reading the wiki?
[5:09:59] <%Solidus_113> Kojima goes far beyond Galaxy Brain. Nobody can understand this
[5:09:59] <SolverCODO> She's an embodiment of it. The previous EEs didnt have consciousness but humans just happen to
[5:09:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> but why
[5:09:59] <Demon_chann> paige is right holy shit shes right
[5:09:59] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> so Amelie is Angra Mainyu?
[5:09:59] <2daygamer> thanks paige
[5:09:59] <+ccwettr123> @AngriestPat you can try not to shit, but eventually you WILL have to shit
[5:10:00] <+necrocannibal2> PAIGE, THE GAME IS DUMB
[5:10:00] <MoulesFritz> this is so fucking boring

[5:10:01] <+hkey_local_machine> Even if you're right, I hate it
[5:10:01] <tri3dgE027> Paige has more of a soul than Pat (as a Ginger) MingLee
[5:10:01] <jetvillain> God this game is dumb
[5:10:02] <+plasticss> paige is right
[5:10:02] <%ekimthegib> She can't die until the extinction happens
[5:10:03] <%skizzuto> She's the anti-christ but doesn't want to be
[5:10:04] <shiny_prinny> ok but why tho
[5:10:04] <%Valdorick> Nope, I agree with Pat here, Kojima is thinking he's thinking big, but he's thinking so fucking small.
[5:10:04] <krymzen5> she is right
[5:10:05] <RunningNGunning> Paige is right
[5:10:05] <+DiabloDeAzul> Huzzah page Clap
[5:10:05] <l3ffectsl> SHE IS THE NATURAL END OF LIFE
[5:10:05] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> oh wait, no
[5:10:05] <+Freelance7> @peachsaliva You fucking nailed it
[5:10:05] <+MechaBaphomet> no its just dumb

[5:10:08] <%velemi> NO YOURE WRONG
[5:10:08] <+Dr_Mooose> Paige genius
[5:10:08] <Mastigias> Paige is right on
[5:10:09] <nukle0nik> paige is basically right
[5:10:09] <devanmuse> Christ, pat is incapable of thinking abstractly
[5:10:10] <beetbo2> youll hate her soon enough @peachsaliva
[5:10:10] <CoffeeTableBlack> she got tired of waiting for the apocalypse so she decided to just say fuck it
[5:10:11] <%Meow0369> Those saying you're wrong are one guy
[5:10:11] <+freeizone> pretty much she is the inevitable
[5:10:12] <%1kenny30> PAIGE WINS
[5:10:12] <+Malogor> i agree with pat
[5:10:12] <SolverCODO> Paige is right
[5:10:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> No, Paige is totally right
[5:10:12] <Novillion> 50/50
[5:10:13] <+코코꾸라> Paige is right
[5:10:13] <duskrush> paige is right
[5:10:13] <hansomeataru> Pat is right and the world is ending
[5:10:14] <nicks220> youre right
[5:10:14] <Basch71> Sam is basically the reason for not going full nuclear
[5:10:14] <Vertigheist> Pat no get
[5:10:14] <Zombrocom> I don't fucking know
[5:10:15] <MaeMae94> Paige is right, but it's still dumb
[5:10:15] <Tunykun> paige is an entity
[5:10:15] <%Meow0369> You're 100 percent correct paige
[5:10:16] <l3ffectsl> SHE FOUND SAM!
[5:10:16] <Jrockoni> well then what the fuck created her then?
[5:10:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> ewwww

[5:10:21] <SvenHolgersson> BB SAM
[5:10:22] <Heartless_01> this is the important part!
[5:10:22] <+DiabloDeAzul> YOU'RE BLUE NOW
[5:10:22] <+LtSergei> a baby
[5:10:22] <%ekimthegib> She lives alone on the beach until the stranding happens
[5:10:22] <%TheSniperJoe> Life ALWAYS chooses to hold off the end, everytime "Everything Ends" life chooses to fight on, that's what life is.
[5:10:23] <+rorschachsjournal505> Paige wins
[5:10:23] <%medusasghost> GROSS
[5:10:24] <+Jolnir> kojima likes throwing all the darts at once and you all just go "wow genius" anyway he really needed the MonsterTM money
[5:10:24] <arkv01> because My Chemical Romance
[5:10:25] <+krawtch> she found you on the ground! hurrah
[5:10:25] <zenith0111> @vaudevillevillain93 Because the end is inevitable. And a lot more symbolism and metaphors
[5:10:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this shit's about to get explained
[5:10:26] <%Madbearv> Its like
[5:10:26] <l3ffectsl> ZOOM IN!
[5:10:26] <%Divryne> PAIGE IS ACTUALLY RIGHT.
[5:10:27] <+Freelance7> PAT WRONG? WHAT?
[5:10:27] <%afronooch> yeah Amelie is the Reapers.
[5:10:28] <marvel877> 1
[5:10:29] <narusao> LUL
[5:10:29] <Delenay> i knew it
[5:10:30] <%silvery_cricket> this is making me hate the game
[5:10:30] <PatchySouls> what a boring bad ending
[5:10:30] <+jake_protagonist> What she is a shit character they're we're supposed to care about when he have only one scene of her acting weird with child Sam
[5:10:30] <+Mondeiya> you could easily portray this better if the writing wasn't filled with stupid terms
[5:10:32] <red_blaster> Paige 10000000 IQ
[5:10:32] <hansomeataru> nah, pat is right
[5:10:33] <%1kenny30> S h e s h o t. t h e b a b y
[5:10:33] <Cranky_Construct> So basically, this is just the plot to Kamen Rider Gaim.
[5:10:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ITLL MAKE SENSE WHEN WE GET TO THE ENDING
[5:10:34] <VigilantShield> okay but why is she this way?
[5:10:34] <Garry_Guyface> This isn't even the end Pat!!!!
[5:10:35] <Mastigias> Wait...was Sam a BB before BB tech?
[5:10:35] <AliceAstro> pat is mad
[5:10:36] <SvenHolgersson> ITS JUST SO DUMB
[5:10:37] <%reonome> pat big stumbo
[5:10:37] <%Meow0369> Pat is trying to find meaning somewhere where it isn't
[5:10:39] <nobody12349> UnderSTRAND?
[5:10:39] <herfaintsmile> it sure is stupid
[5:10:40] <SSBBfan666> her like for Sam and seeing him connect everyone is what causes her to go with his choice rather then go full EE
[5:10:40] <Delenay> she sent him back in time
[5:10:41] <%derap41> "I understand...kinda"
[5:10:41] <l3ffectsl> THIS WHOLE GAME WAS A FIGHT VS NATURE!
[5:10:41] <rekkn91> ok, im out
[5:10:41] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Paige is just reading the chat
[5:10:42] <+remagoediv> A R T
[5:10:42] <+Dr_Mooose> wellllll
[5:10:42] <nauticalgypsy> It’s just pseudo intellectual bullshit
[5:10:43] <+FrenchTact1cs> Not the stupidest
[5:10:43] <krymzen5> oh its dumb
[5:10:44] <Basch71> basically
[5:10:45] <%Madbearv> She's cthulu who was forced to experience human life
[5:10:45] <bahamut1010> THIS IS STUPID YES
[5:10:46] <+krawtch> SWADDLE THE BB
[5:10:46] <%televisedrevolting> At this point, all I want to know is what's the correct opinion to have for this game, so I can't be wrong?
[5:10:46] <+freeizone> the god of destruction
[5:10:46] <%Valdorick> This ending has ruined the game. TRUCKING IS RUINED
[5:10:46] <tijikiotecalt> don't defend a poorly written story by injecting your own meaning into it
[5:10:46] <+jake_protagonist> Paige is right and Pat is right that its dumb
[5:10:47] <Sp3ctre48> It probably makes sense but its not really being delivered in the best way imo
[5:10:47] <%dickbuttwoman> Pat, wait and have someone explain it to you
[5:10:47] <%ekimthegib> She doesn't want to be alone for all eternity
[5:10:47] <+necrocannibal2> it is the stupidest
[5:10:48] <Deimos002> Pat is dumb and now also salty
[5:10:48] <+TheBigO75> art
[5:10:48] <hansomeataru> this is so stupid
[5:10:49] <MoulesFritz> this is garbage
[5:10:49] <jetvillain> Interpretation? Game spells out everything
[5:10:49] <%Aleate> IS REDDUS LOU?
[5:10:49] <Garry_Guyface> We are on ending 2 of 4
[5:10:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THIS ISNT THE ENDING, ITLL MAKE SENSE
[5:10:49] <42nfl19> Wait IS THAT bb?
[5:10:49] <+Andrizzleton> it's not vague it's overwrought
[5:10:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> I mean it's still bullshit, mainly because of HOW we're being fed this info
[5:10:50] <+desfore> @AngriestPat Under - STRAND?
[5:10:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> She's SUPPOSED to bring about an extinction event, but she doesn't want to. she needs to, yet she would rather not. Nature versus nurture
[5:10:51] <cherrycottontail> reemember kojima said it would take 20 years to figure this game out
[5:10:51] <+theonebuns> a person is chosen to be an ee
[5:10:51] <Tunykun> it's avaaaaant gaaaaaarde
[5:10:52] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> biggest cheater
[5:10:52] <@commanderclaw> Then nature is evil
[5:10:52] <%BlueMoonBlues> Pat WILL be mad
[5:10:53] <allanmiri> I'm with Pat. Fuck this bitch.
[5:10:53] <korth367> no u
[5:10:53] <Psykoknight65> To Paige, she literally just told pat that the world tries to end us and we evovle to fight back and live on
[5:10:53] <$sassyquatch963> kojima? leaving something up to interpritation?
[5:10:54] <MessyBristles> wow Paige is actually right
[5:10:54] <BunnyEmperor> KOJIMAS FANTASY IS INFINITE
[5:10:54] <therealritzreal> she is not nature
[5:10:54] <night__monkey> YOU'RE STUPID HAHA GOTTEM
[5:10:54] <BlackermanZX> ITS KOJIMBO PAT
[5:10:55] <%DatGuyJimbo> I don't understand so it's bad
[5:10:55] <TuxedoNash> I don't understrand.
[5:10:56] <Ipsenscastle> both are correct
[5:10:56] <%1kenny30> IT IS AND IT'S AWESOME
[5:10:56] <%umbypokochan> it's just like The Happening
[5:10:56] <%This_is_Marco> It just happens 4Head
[5:10:56] <%Maids4lyfe> no it's Sam
[5:10:57] <+zanzibar_junker> Reviving you triggered the Last Stranding
[5:10:57] <+Freelance7> I think this is the best game of 2019
[5:10:57] <DRAGKUDO> then what would be better?
[5:10:58] <+jiggy_snipe> why did she act like a human tho?
[5:10:58] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[5:10:59] <Hellarussian> yes
[5:10:59] <Blank9> pat is right it's just not well defined or written
[5:10:59] <%chiluzza> yeah

[5:11:00] <vapeking42069> paige is super wrong NATURE DOES NOT HAVE AGENCY
[5:11:00] <Gabbycat> The fuck were you expecting Pat?

[5:11:13] <OuterHades> Pat big dummy
[5:11:13] <VaudevilleVillain93> I guess the apocalypse can change its mind
[5:11:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Paige is right but it's also stupid
[5:11:13] <+Jolnir> @AngriestPat Not yet Pat! It's not over yet!
[5:11:13] <%velemi> It's kojima jacking himself off over how smart he thinks he is
[5:11:14] <Crimpson> Just because you don't understand Pat, does not make it stupid
[5:11:14] <+rorschachsjournal505> Goddamnit pat stop

[5:13:13] <vapeking42069> NO TIME FOR QUESTIONS PAT
[5:13:13] <narusao> DOOMS are supernatural abilities that characters in Death Stranding use to interact and perceive the otherworldly entities of BTs (Beached Things) and The Beach (the liminal space between our world and that of the dead).
[5:13:14] <IndoorSitup> PAT IS TURNING INTO CINEMASINS

[5:13:26] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> DOOMS is just a condition where certain individuals share Amelie's nightmares and have certain Death Stranding related abilities
[5:13:26] <BustRobot> Why does this game feel the need to repeat the same exposition SO MANY TIMES?!?!??!?!

[5:13:32] <%Meow0369> It's already explained, she's an EE, it's her instinct, but she's smart enough to be able to make some effort towards preventing her own nature from succeeding
[5:13:32] <$sassyquatch963> pee on her
[5:13:32] <ramphs> previous ee's were not human, so this is the first time an EE would show emotion/compassion @AngriestPat

[5:16:09] <+dredayy56> Mayb e it's all just sequel bait
[5:16:10] <Crimpson> Kojima's name is posted like 100 times

[5:16:22] <%Mekhet09> Go into the water
[5:16:23] <Virokwet> why even move tho
[5:16:23] <valriot> @angriestpat Pat the idea is that rather than just "pop" life ends, return to nothing, you fight death and evolve into something that can appreciate the time you have
[5:16:24] <sirrice77> You just have to wait out the credits
[5:16:24] <%cvp5127> grab some food?

[5:17:10] <Amesa3420> kogumbo make you jump for story peanuts lolol
[5:17:10] <Illiobillium> I said this above but like Amelie's deal is similar to angel biblical lore; they are intelligent enough to know what they're doing is fucked up, but they have no free will beyond what God made them for, and if they break out of that they become demons or whatever.
[5:17:11] <sirrice77> Also theres still more ending stuff

[5:17:22] <%reddpop_> look out to the water
[5:17:22] <+Imn0tacop> Well this is either gonna be a huge dissapointment or one of the best things I've ever seen in a game. I can't wait for Kojima to pull some wierd shit with this.
[5:17:23] <Zombrocom> Maybe?
[5:17:23] <corpsegoo> I continue not being ready for the next chapter
[5:17:23] <arkv01> HIDEO HACKJIMA, duh

[5:17:24] <BlackermanZX> wrong
[5:17:24] <bathoi> they were the past EEs
[5:17:24] <+Edrem> Kappa
[5:17:24] <Auriel_Astrum> this is so poorly executed, the game is wasting the players time we've been at this part for like 20-30 mins, it's so badly designed from a gameplay standpoint, a good game engages the player rather than sit them down and take all power away from them, a game is a dialogue between the player and creator but the player has no control in this at all
[5:17:24] <cheesedburgers> I sure hope that the afterlife doesn’t look like an Icelandic coast
[5:17:25] <%ekimthegib> if he's wrong, what are they?
[5:17:25] <Stormo> no the five figures in the sky are EVEN DUMBER than what you think they are
[5:17:26] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean maybe
[5:17:26] <+LtSergei> you'll see what the five guys are
[5:17:26] <StarlingSilence> i thought they were the five previous EEs
[5:17:27] <l3ffectsl> LOOK AT THE BIG BRAIN ON PAT, YOU A SMART MOTHERFUCKER THATS RIGHT
[5:17:27] <SvenHolgersson> THIS MUSIC IS TOO GOOD TO BE IN THIS GAME

[5:17:29] <+butch_deadlift> this game could have been so cool
[5:17:30] <Decimated_body> SILENT HILLS DIED FOR THIS LUL

[5:17:32] <vampireinarm> man this was way cooler as just trailers than as an actual game
[5:17:33] <%crazyspartan214> can you equip gun now?
[5:17:33] <bestwaifuritsu> Have you tried killing yourself though, you have the gun
[5:17:33] <rytisone> Will Woolie enjoy this?

[5:17:37] <Hellarussian> if you look up you can see Kojima dabbing
[5:17:38] <astrofalcon1> i don't think mgs 3 can even compare
[5:17:39] <NotHereToStream> don't do it 4Head
[5:17:39] <%Meow0369> That's what she's trying to do
[5:17:39] <candidateplays> They;re not the past EEs, the past EEs weren't human.
[5:17:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> TI just fucking joined and I am so confused
[5:17:40] <coracor> BECOME HOMO DEMONS

[5:17:46] <Ssguy10> JUST DONT DO IT 4Head
[5:17:46] <+freeizone> D.O.O.M.S = 5 characters PogChamp
[5:17:46] <VaudevilleVillain93> Why does an EE need to be personified?
[5:17:47] <%silvery_cricket> This sucks
[5:17:48] <l3ffectsl> THATS HER PURPOSE
[5:17:48] <artoflec> your good paige, the song is REALLY loud though
[5:17:48] <%Animorphimagi> thanks Paige
[5:17:49] <MSN04_Sazabi> If she can start it early she can start it late
[5:17:49] <%ekimthegib> The game's fine guys, it's just weird
[5:17:50] <morningmoondude> loud music
[5:17:51] <+Buzzkill983> She needed Sam to take her down, cuz Paige is right
[5:17:51] <Mendin> Here @AngriestPat , Amelie is Kaworu Nagisa from Evangelion
[5:17:52] <%medusasghost> The music is slowly drowning paige out
[5:17:53] <SolverCODO> Pat is being obtuse
[5:17:53] <VigilantShield> how can she not have a choice is she gives him the choice?
[5:17:54] <Timurine> Just defy god 4Head
[5:17:54] <+rorschachsjournal505> PAT, DID YOU EVEN BOTHER TO PAY ATTENTION
[5:17:55] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Are you sure. Kojimbo never explained it.
[5:17:56] <%razielhex> @Illiobillium You're using apocryphal/pseudo-epigraphical sources like the Book of Enoch and Milton's Paradise Lost.
[5:17:57] <IndoorSitup> PAT HAS BECOME CINEMASINS
[5:17:58] <SummonerMagno> PAt is in angry mode, he will not accept more information anymore
[5:17:58] <krymzen5> she saw every scenario. it all ended bad
[5:17:59] <%DisGuyOvahEre> go to the MOUNTAINS
[5:17:59] <CrypticMochi> What did I miss? Was Pat being stubborn about something?
[5:17:59] <VidulaSaix> It's almost like it's a fictional story Pat LUL
[5:18:00] <%1kenny30> LMAO People think this is the end
[5:18:00] <arkv01> dude tis just evangelion, theres no need to analyze this
[5:18:02] <bahamut1010> @freeizone IQ2000
[5:18:02] <ObsidianSolitaire> Pat, YOU don't understand YOURSELF!
[5:18:03] <Cdjgamer> Dooms is five letters
[5:18:04] <BigHugs> Wrong
[5:18:04] <+Freelance7> @hoilywood_sn He is just hating on it because the chat called him wrong. He doesn't understand it, so it's bad.
[5:18:05] <MessyBristles> she causes extinction whether she wants it to happen or not
[5:18:05] <+jiggy_snipe> God made an angel have it's body and soul split then get it's body cancer
[5:18:05] <%HRDSalami654> God is making you do this.
[5:18:06] <%derap41> It doesn't matter how well its explained outside of the game if the game can't tell its story its a fucking bad story
[5:18:06] <Lutre> AS OPPOSED TO THE NEBULOUS CONCEPT OF FREE WILL?!
[5:18:07] <DRAGKUDO> It's fantasy pat.
[5:18:07] <medril07> avatar
[5:18:07] <corpsegoo> nah silent hill died for konami's pachinko boner
[5:18:07] <%Keyd00d> Just do what I want lol
[5:18:08] <SvenHolgersson> Also she aged to 20 before she got to the beach?
[5:18:09] <Skatedeandre> Pat being obtuse is nothing new though
[5:18:09] <+LtSergei> if you paid attention to the emails you'd get it
[5:18:10] <Aydarkzero> that was her avatar
[5:18:10] <%skizzuto> we've reached peak stumbo
[5:18:10] <%Meow0369> What no
[5:18:11] <riotshark> thats literally not at all what happened
[5:18:11] <%reonome> a kojima game is nonsense? You don't say Kappa
[5:18:11] <%HRDSalami654> But don't though!
[5:18:12] <+Caped_Eggy> Wasn't she human to begin with?
[5:18:13] <Kghaleon> There's like an hour more, this ain't the end.
[5:18:13] <+CrowGuy> She loves humanity, AMERICA made her realize that
[5:18:13] <valriot> Pat you saying "Don't do it" is the same as people going "Just don't be sad BRO"
[5:18:14] <$Nobody404> But all the umbilical cord ghosts aren't nonsense?
[5:18:14] <+thewellroundedgamer99> It is nonsense, but I love it
[5:18:16] <nukle0nik> they weren't split, they shared a conscience
[5:18:16] <Dio_TR> KOJUMBO HAS DONE IT AGAIN
[5:18:16] <%Alpha8087> Just them existing sounds like it is going to happen. The body they present themselves in is just an attempt to let them know or something
[5:18:16] <Artista_AF> "they can't Not do it" "Just don't do it!" LUL
[5:18:18] <+DiabloDeAzul> IT'S NONSENSE THAT'S BEEN DONE A BILLION TIMES PAT
[5:18:18] <+RestlessCorpse> No, that's literally what happened lol
[5:18:18] <Zinax7> this is final fantasy tactics advance pat
[5:18:18] <%Owkono> just watch tv
[5:18:19] <SvenHolgersson> WAS SHE HUMAN WTF
[5:18:19] <%Keyd00d> ...WHAT
[5:18:20] <zenith0111> @auriel_astrum Yeah that's the point. Sometimes, like death, you have no choice. It is what it is.
[5:18:21] <%Meow0369> paige you're right
[5:18:23] <l3ffectsl> THAT HAPPENED TO HER! SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN
[5:18:23] <RunningNGunning> Pat, do you remember the guy in MGS3 WHO CONTROLLED BEES?
[5:18:24] <%Animorphimagi> if Amelie EXISTS she creates the apocalypse. even once dead
[5:18:24] <%silvery_cricket> BUT SHE WASNT AN EE SHE WAS A LADY
[5:18:24] <Illiobillium> @razielhest Oh I'm aware, but just trying to put it into vague words that Pat might understand right.
[5:18:25] <17sevens> She was on the Beach for literal eternity until she did it. Literally no choice.
[5:18:25] <+코코꾸라> Paige is right
[5:18:27] <+Freelance7> Paige is right
[5:18:27] <MillaMoks> @AngriestPat Are you not describing Virgil from DMC5 with that summary of the EE Pat?
[5:18:28] <VidulaSaix> God listening to him poorly explain this to Woolie is going to hurt NotLikeThis
[5:18:30] <+locutus_of_the_porg> KINO
[5:18:30] <Decimated_body> I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON!
[5:18:30] <marvel877> Pat's mad he didnt read the same psych books Kojima did.
[5:18:30] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but then who made Amelie?
[5:18:31] <HoIlywood_SN> Paige is right
[5:18:31] <+Buzzkill983> Essentially, she can''t stop it, so she gave Sam the tools to stop her?
[5:18:31] <+jake_protagonist> The fact she tried to act all human and emotional is what ruined it
[5:18:32] <%FrostMass22> @svenholgersson Yes and no
[5:18:32] <+DAURAGON_C_MIKADO> Wow it’s almost like Kojima is a big hack
[5:18:32] <PE4X> she just didn´t wanted to wait
[5:18:32] <+Arsimckhoi> I don't know why this game is
[5:18:32] <%Keyd00d> okay pat has no idea
[5:18:33] <gensoukaizou> imagine how great PT would've been
[5:18:33] <Heartless_01> big brain paige
[5:18:33] <IndoorSitup> PAT HAS BECOME CINEMASINS HOLY SHIT
[5:18:34] <night__monkey> i like how Pat is just trolling and he really isn't this stupid Kappa
[5:18:34] <Picosunloaded> paige is super right
[5:18:34] <+Imn0tacop> this song is still great tho
[5:18:37] <Lutre> paige is RIGHT
[5:18:38] <+BoomerTiro> "I guess I'm just not intellectual enough to get it" These are simple concepts that were over explained
[5:18:39] <%ekimthegib> I mean, she accidentally caused ghosts to enter the world
[5:18:39] <%1kenny30> IT'S EVANGELION PAT
[5:18:41] <DRAGKUDO> that would have been worse
[5:18:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh wow we closin in on 2000 viewers
[5:18:42] <+jake_protagonist> Ia gree
[5:18:42] <+HarryWizard> kojumbo is right
[5:18:43] <neekocheeko> paige schooling pat right now
[5:18:45] <rhydwings> amelie is the only one to be split, every one else was one whole being
[5:18:45] <+hkey_local_machine> Yeah!
[5:18:45] <+zanzibar_junker> Humanity will die but life on Earth will continued
[5:18:45] <SSBBfan666> BTs, Timefall. It all stems from Amelie's refusal to do what she was supposed to do.
[5:18:45] <%Meow0369> This isn't the ending
[5:18:46] <Hellarussian> a little bit
[5:18:47] <Jkhmn12> @AngriestPat all this stuff your hearing is inaccurate
[5:18:47] <VigilantShield> agreed
[5:18:48] <+Imn0tacop> Paige is right, but Pat is right that it's bad
[5:18:48] <+FrenchTact1cs> These things are actually being told to you
[5:18:48] <%dave323dave> Agreed
[5:18:48] <%cureneckbeard> This is like that thing where Ragnarok is interpreted as a cycle
[5:18:49] <zenith0111> IT'S LITERALLY EVANGELION
[5:18:49] <Stormo> you *csn't* shoot her
[5:18:50] <EuropanLamprey> What were the EEs like when all life was just algae?
[5:18:50] <haisho> but it's Kojumbo though
[5:18:50] <%GarbageNirvana> I like out of everything else that has happened in this game this is what Pat gets hung up on
[5:18:50] <%reddpop_> Shes like NIA from TTGL, she wasnt aware she was the instrument of the end when she started
[5:18:51] <+freezydude> agreed
[5:18:52] <+krawtch> if you don't do the thing you're supposed to do, maybe you are trapped running around a rocky beach forever
[5:18:54] <Kouseo> @AngriestPat its one thing to not like it but youre not even trying to understand it
[5:18:54] <Psych_man13_13> Well thats because your a basic bitch Pat
[5:18:54] <Crimpson> He is Paige
[5:18:55] <hansomeataru> pat is right this is stupid
[5:18:55] <%keyworthe> this isn't CLOSE to the ending
[5:18:55] <+necrocannibal2> definitely
[5:18:55] <LeninCake> he already doesnt understand, i cant wait until he gives woolie an awfulrecap of this awful ending xd
[5:18:55] <%reonome> LUL
[5:18:56] <%silvery_cricket> THIS IS TERRIBLE
[5:18:56] <%Meow0369> paige we can't hear you over the music
[5:18:56] <%deviljhojho_> tomatoBWL
[5:18:56] <+berserker_103> They just give someone of the species that needs to die, the role
[5:18:57] <BlackermanZX> Damn LUL
[5:18:57] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[5:18:57] <%keyworthe> my friend
[5:18:58] <+Andrizzleton> She was a lady then had surgery and died and split and became an EE
[5:18:58] <CoffeeTableBlack> also being born a EE game her the power to make the chirial network
[5:18:59] <+DankDreamTeam> Pat cant be serious
[5:18:59] <RunningNGunning> LUL
[5:19:01] <Droofasa> nah, this shit dumb
[5:19:01] <Aydarkzero> i've never seen Evangalion so i have no idea
[5:19:02] <%afronooch> LUL
[5:19:02] <SvenHolgersson> Paige is the closest to right but I agree with Pat it;s fucking STUPID
[5:19:03] <Stormo> there is NO choice there even though the game says there is
[5:19:03] <%ArtemisCroc> pat that would undermine the whole theme of connections lol
[5:19:03] <VidulaSaix> Pat it's fine if you dont like it but you LITERALLY aren't getting it at all
[5:19:04] <lethallylactic> LUL
[5:19:04] <+Dr_Mooose> "listen"
[5:19:04] <%silvery_cricket> THE IDEAL DEATH STRANDING PLAYER
[5:19:06] <%Divryne> I can’t believe Paige understands Death Stranding better than Pat.
[5:19:06] <tijikiotecalt> this is legitmately poor story telling
[5:19:07] <BYAKURENLOVER763> s'bad writing
[5:19:07] <ramphs> HOW?
[5:19:07] <MessyBristles> pat this is a new form of crazy talk
[5:19:08] <Zombrocom> It's pretty dumb though
[5:19:09] <+freeizone> did you rike it?
[5:19:09] <narusao> embrace the nonsense
[5:19:09] <+Freelance7> No guys, he really is this stupid
[5:19:10] <l3ffectsl> SUBJECTIVE
[5:19:10] <Arblaster_> Kojima is a hack
[5:19:10] <%ekimthegib> She revived Sam, and caused ghosts to flood in
[5:19:10] <Crimpson> Pat thinks it's stupid because he doesn't understand
[5:19:11] <+RestlessCorpse> I mean yeah, it's dumb, but that's what happened
[5:19:11] <%DisGuyOvahEre> @AngriestPat MOUNTAINS
[5:19:12] <Ipsenscastle> Pat's right. It's just wankery
[5:19:12] <+Ilpala> "I would've literally had nothing"
[5:19:12] <coracor> KOJIMBO DOES IT AGAIN
[5:19:13] <+rorschachsjournal505> That sounds legitimately worse
[5:19:14] <%Valdorick> Its really dumb. Its not deep. He's thinking he's deep; Kojima is not deep.
[5:19:15] <%xcompleasedad> THIS BIT SUCKS DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK
[5:19:16] <+sabertoothzombie> or you just don't get it
[5:19:16] <%Meow0369> "almost done" hahahaha
[5:19:16] <Drivershaft> the extinction is a natural unavoidable process that Amelie can trigger or stave off, like death, its a motivation for life to do more with the time it has
[5:19:17] <+TheSaintJohn> just end all your explanations with 'maaaaaaaan'
[5:19:17] <SSBBfan666> I get it Pat, its not stupid
[5:19:18] <%Strider222> they're not that long
[5:19:19] <valriot> That would've been stupid, like the entire game has been against "dur just kill them"
[5:19:19] <+krawtch> how many times was Kojima in the credits
[5:19:19] <%razielhex> Hideo Kojima
[5:19:19] <+MechaBaphomet> KOJUMBO DOES IT AGAIN
[5:19:20] <+BoomerTiro> Pat your questions were answered which means you do not get it.
[5:19:20] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> She's a literal personification of extinction brought about by the vague "will" of the cosmos
[5:19:20] <phatmac16> PAT IS RIGHT
[5:19:20] <%derap41> Its about it being told so fucking bad and having so many fucking holes in it
[5:19:21] <%1kenny30> IT'S NOT AN ENDING
[5:19:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Bane_Kaikyo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! just got home from muh thunksgivin shit... love muh fambily but WOW the anxiety.... glad to be home.... Hope you guys (chat included) had/are having a gud Thankersgibbink
[5:19:21] <+Tyonidus> People who don't understand how bad this is are the stupid ones....this is as bad a story as the new STAR WARS movies LMAO
[5:19:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> @AngriestPat How? Why? When? The answer is: WE need a sequel, PAt
[5:19:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> SNAKE, ITS NOT OVER YET
[5:19:22] <+necrocannibal2> Konami was right, Pat
[5:19:23] <red_blaster> 2 HOURS LEFT
[5:19:23] <%nmaten> made by bideo Kojimbo
[5:19:23] <+Qsmash_> YOu mean the whole game wasn't like that?
[5:19:23] <LeninCake> DAMN KOJIMA IS A GENIUS
[5:19:24] <+jiggy_snipe> there was a dinosaur who was an extinction entity?
[5:19:24] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Aydarkzero its very dumb
[5:19:25] <Timurine> This is the worst part of the game
[5:19:25] <SvenHolgersson> Maybe the next two save it?
[5:19:25] <zenith0111> What is the thing that you're supposed to get then Pat?!
[5:19:25] <Zinax7> THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T DRINK MONSTER PAT
[5:19:25] <+ArcLifth> It can be dumb and you dont get it
[5:19:25] <IndoorSitup> PAT HAS BECOME CINEMASINS
[5:19:26] <42nfl19> It is the notion of am I born evil or can I choose to be not evil I think Paige.
[5:19:26] <%oceanmatt> DEATH STRANDING AFTER STORY
[5:19:26] <PE4X> like a little child but why ... but why,.... but why though
[5:19:27] <cheesedburgers> Honestly nothing that lies at the end of this story was ever gonna be as cool as what we all individually came up with in our heads over the past 3 years.
[5:19:27] <Arblaster_> Wait this isn't the ending? NotLikeThis
[5:19:29] <Jflaskd13> you can understand something and still find it dumb
[5:19:30] <$realm_forge> Does that mean there’s a beach with a melodramatic T-Rex stomping around somewhere?
[5:19:31] <waifoong98> Infinite is fucking stupid tho
[5:19:31] <rytisone> But wait, there's more
[5:19:32] <+D00msDayDan> everything after this EE crap is so much better
[5:19:32] <+justianxix> Did you not want an explaination?
[5:19:32] <%FrostMass22> So the chiral network caused BTs? I beat the game and still don't know
[5:19:33] <dalante323> Play league of legends
[5:19:34] <+idyota> dammit i just tuned in, what happened, why is he blue?
[5:19:34] <astrofalcon1> bioshock infinite is a masterpiece
[5:19:35] <%Keyd00d> CinemaSins pat
[5:19:36] <+necrocannibal2> KONAMI WAS RIGHT
[5:19:36] <Zombrocom> Bioshock Infinite is awful
[5:19:37] <%TheSniperJoe> You literally don't though.
[5:19:37] <+CrowGuy> Bioshock: Infant
[5:19:38] <%razielhex> GUN
[5:19:39] <+Andrizzleton> Before Amelie became an EE there were VOIDOUTS(how did voidouts start?!?!)
[5:19:39] <VidulaSaix> Like I said Pat it's fine if you don't like it but you LITERALLY aren't getting it at all
[5:19:39] <%Animorphimagi> best chapters incoming
[5:19:39] <candidateplays> The rest of the game is great, though. Really love the end.
[5:19:40] <Aydarkzero> Infinite was just an okay game didn't care for the story
[5:19:41] <%Meow0369> Trailer moment
[5:19:42] <l3ffectsl> it makes sence in its world
[5:19:43] <%Valdorick> Shoot yourself
[5:19:44] <marvel877> No, Bioshock shit the bed hard.
[5:19:44] <skeletonknifefight> they hated pat because he told the truth
[5:19:45] <Storm_Samurai> Two more?????
[5:19:46] <SvenHolgersson> Bioshock Infinite made sense it was just a little stupid THIS IS FULL ON STUPID
[5:19:46] <Ipsenscastle> Bioshock Infinite had a much more effective ending than this
[5:19:46] <rhydwings> evangelion is people being turned into a whole being not everything gets wiped clean
[5:19:46] <Crimpson> Soooo the gun is loaded?

[5:19:49] <neekocheeko> paige is right but pat is also right. I hate everything with amelie but the rest is kino
[5:19:50] <+VanaSkiller> yep
[5:19:50] <%Keyd00d> no Infinite is way worse
[5:19:50] <zenith0111> IT'S SUPER STRAIGHT FORWARD
[5:19:51] <SethAm_> tfw I went afk for like 10 minutes max and probably missed the biggest thing
[5:19:51] <night__monkey> this is actually kojima's most straightforward story
[5:19:51] <+freezydude> watch this be kill yourself
[5:19:52] <Sp3ctre48> They spoiled lots of stuff
[5:19:53] <+TheSaintJohn> infinite was garbo and I loved it

[6:42:16] <marvel877> Pat's mad Kojima read different psych books then him.
[6:42:17] <%Animorphimagi> that is BULLSHIT
[6:42:17] <%crimsonharvest> i think hes invoking heraclitus
[6:42:18] <%Keyd00d> huh
[6:42:19] <SvenHolgersson> Well it is a Kojima game
[6:42:20] <Kghaleon> FYI, there are post-game files that tell you what happens to each of the characters.
[6:42:21] <Virokwet> oh kojima stuff you mean
[6:42:22] <HiggsV> You called?
[6:42:24] <%dickbuttwoman> Pat, did you fail phil 101?
[6:42:24] <duskrush> @angriestpat So is getting shot by Mads why Lisa is missing an eye in P.T.?
[6:42:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Thaaaaat's Kojima
[6:42:25] <%derap41> Rules of the universe tend to stay the same
[6:42:25] <%Meow0369> You missed the uhh email from the mother
[6:42:26] <+DAURAGON_C_MIKADO> Yeah no lol
[6:42:27] <+jake_protagonist> Thats Kojima for ya
[6:42:27] <nobody12349> Dogs can conversate but not read?
[6:42:27] <waifoong98> FailFish
[6:42:32] <$vincerocmm> what about the 5 wight baby's were they the extinctions
[6:42:35] <%DisGuyOvahEre> apatSkelmo
[6:42:36] <%ItsRatman> @AngriestPat So Pat... what's the verdict? Good game or bad game?
[6:42:38] <IndoorSitup> HERE WE GO.....
[6:42:42] <%Animorphimagi> All magic comes from Amelie
[6:42:43] <dreu81> dogs have big sniff good
[6:42:45] <Artista_AF> i mean it would be a close aproximation but all the more abstract shit would be different, like Language & Myths & shit
[6:42:47] <%DisGuyOvahEre> theunc69GRIMMACE
[6:42:52] <Namillus> Psst. How come Sam's body, BB, Lou, is a girl
[6:42:52] <SnaKemuho> @vincerocmm probably some rando BTs that looked cool
[6:42:52] <nobody12349> @ItsRatman It's a goodbadgame
[6:42:55] <+awalkingdude> A creationist story. A God urges evolution along with extinction events. ok
[6:42:56] <%megabrogus> Pat thinks up humans have the highest possible perception of reality. that's a little narcissistic
[6:42:56] <nevan0> oh no
[6:43:01] <+Hussias> So I just bought this game and I’ve been playing for a couple of hours- I cant get into it. Am I just a UPS driver??? Wtf? Did I just spend $60 at GameStop for nothing or does it get better. I’m thinking of stopping now. What do u think?
[6:43:08] <zenith0111> @bensonplayspokemon Then it's not for you LUL
[6:43:10] <HeroToxiko> Bad nihilism is real apocalyptic
[6:43:12] <%mield916> highs is room kid
[6:43:14] <Nested_Dreams> This is just Dio back story
[6:43:16] <Charuzu> guys gravity is not subjective...
[6:43:17] <%Meow0369> And now higgs is stuck for all of eternity in some shithole. The punishment doesn't really fit the crime if you ask me
[6:43:18] <munchkay> !uptime
[6:43:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 43m.
[6:43:19] <IndoorSitup> @hussias n00b
[6:43:21] <tigerfang86> BUBBLE KID HIGGS
[6:43:22] <Explodincatz> HOMO demons
[6:43:22] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @awalkingdude so he's like Wesker (and Gil)
[6:43:25] <Idon__> But he's not WRONG though
[6:43:26] <GreenEggsAndSlam> Yeah that explains Higgs
[6:43:36] <DRAGKUDO> Levi?
[6:43:39] <eco419> D:
[6:43:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Meow0369 He nuked whole cities and infected the world with even more BT's
[6:43:40] <%derap41> @Charuzu it kinda is relativity and all that
[6:43:52] <HeroToxiko> D:
[6:43:53] <%LouieRouie> nah fuck that guy
[6:43:54] <%Laecerelius> So this guy had the usual anime bad guy upbringing
[6:43:57] <braaklyn> Do we know what year this game takes place?
[6:43:58] <Mendin> Yowza
[6:44:05] <IndoorSitup> Man, chat was toxic as FUCK tonight.
[6:44:13] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @IndoorSitup no u
[6:44:14] <%mield916> he hates connection because he was beaten as a kid
[6:44:14] <randomness_yo> Has Pat beat Star Wars yet?
[6:44:15] <Lutre> fucking hell Higgs
[6:44:16] <HeroToxiko> Crapsack world European Extreme
[6:44:16] <%reonome> yikes
[6:44:18] <AMUSERNAME> This sounds like the backstory of GYRO from HXH.

[6:44:42] <%Seraphile> craaaaawling in my skin
[6:44:46] <$QueequegTheater> THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAL
[6:44:49] <Charuzu> relativity refers to frames of reference but the curvature of mass making gravity is not subjective perception it's fact
[6:44:52] <+Hussias> Koonami was right to fire Hideo
[6:44:54] <braaklyn> More like FUCKING pain eyyyy
[6:44:54] <%Valdorick> Higgs walks the lonely road, for its the only one he has ever known

[6:46:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh man, I cannot believe that fucking Chiral Artist conclusion, what a shitshow, Kojima
[6:46:02] <%Meow0369> @AngriestPat There are post game emails that come through explaining the fates of each character
[6:46:03] <rhydwings> most of this games script was in kojimas broken understanding of english, a lot of thing would be better understood if he actually had an editor
[6:46:05] <DeadRuins> @AngriestPat read the one about john
[6:46:05] <%derap41> no bb dreams
[6:46:07] <Crimpson> You have BB

[6:46:09] <randomness_yo> IN THE END. IT DOESNT EVEN MATTER
[6:46:10] <+Hussias> This game was just a Hideo kojima cum stain
[6:46:10] <+AFrostyCookie> Go and find the thing that says what die hardman's full name is
[6:46:11] <SnaKemuho> Konami was right but they're also shitheads
[6:46:12] <mankeytennis> SAVE ME FROM THIS NOTHING IVE BECOME
[6:46:12] <Twistedwolfie> @AngriestPat did you get the Lisa PT reference?
[6:46:14] <%takiyami> You do, you just don't get the Madlad cutscenes
[6:46:16] <$QueequegTheater> @zenith0111 It's badly understood college freshmen psychology drivel but pretends it's the cutting edge of philosophy
[6:46:17] <%reonome> BB is right there
[6:46:19] <SethAm_> People not liking this game means konami being abusive were actually the good guys
[6:46:21] <medril07> Did he say Louise?
[6:46:21] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat go cause some void outs
