[0:02:53] <%Mr_Pylon> dropped off of this like 10 hrs in back in the day so looking forward to seeing what happens
[0:02:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I have to wonder how many people who say "ME3 is good, tho!" played it first before the others
[0:03:01] <knight_verse> YEEAAAHH, Time to go to way with the Batarians.
[0:03:03] <darthtriceretops4aby> Murder the batarians super hard
[0:03:04] <%Dakuu75> Juronimoooooo~
[0:03:08] <knight_verse> *war
[0:03:20] <%James_Quivers> Time for Based Vega, the best human crewmate in the series
[0:03:27] <sapphomet777> rev up those turian fryers
[0:03:34] <%count_bob> ...eeeehhhh.
[0:03:35] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> are you guys ready for 90% less dialogue wheels
[0:03:38] <secret_npc> ME3 is great, I played it after 1 and 2
[0:03:40] <4DLuvOfLuthy> Here it is!
[0:03:41] <%jtdobyns> wish you could have romanced legion haha
[0:03:44] <%JamesCorck> cheer500 Yo Pat, hype as fuck to see you play Mass Effect 3. Now, before you get into it, is it okay for you to tell us, what do you know of Mass Effect 3, what are you familiar with or what have you heard about it over the years?
[0:03:44] <+Soliloquy123> I do think ME3 is *good* but absolutely weaker than the other two
[0:03:48] <%Rumbutt> Rumbutt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! DIED TO BORN WOLRD IS A FUCK KILL EM ALL 2186 I am Pat Shephard 410,757,864,530 DEAD BATARIANS
[0:03:51] <PunchSlugfest> I wonder if pat has considered the dragon age series as a potential let's play
[0:03:52] <darthtriceretops4aby> Press Rt to John wick
[0:03:54] <%Dakuu75> REEEEEEEEE~!
[0:03:57] <sapphomet777> im excited to see pats reaction more than that fucking Child
[0:03:59] <%GarbageNirvana> quick hide star child in the badement
[0:04:03] <secret_npc> Opening is weak but picks up immediately at Mars
[0:04:03] <%count_bob> @ItsYaGirlMaria That's a good thing.
[0:04:07] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> YEAH MASS EFFECT
[0:04:10] <%AncelDeLambert> god, Dragon Age would take FOREVER to play
[0:04:11] <sapphomet777> i cant wait for Child
[0:04:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @sapphomet777 I fucking forgot about that kid
[0:04:17] <%count_bob> 90% of the time, the options are all the same thing.
[0:04:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Fuck
[0:04:29] <darthtriceretops4aby> Explanation of the ending is what I’m super hype for
[0:04:33] <%machshop> machshop subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! shepard
[0:04:35] <%SpcOpsBear> Javik pls stop pressing the snooze button on your stasis coffin
[0:04:35] <%count_bob> Yes, Yes but rude, No.
[0:04:36] <+LumberjackJack> I'm very curious of the overall reaction during the playthrough. ME3 rightfully deserves the backlash for the faults it has, but over time, I feel that the positives are resurfacing again
[0:04:39] <%James_Quivers> I played the series in order, each on release, and what puts ME3 just over the top for me is that it's actually fun to play as a video game, as opposed to (largely) the other two
[0:04:40] <dd44dostivei> everybody be sure to yell at pat for not playing vanguard the right way
[0:04:44] <%Lizard0TM> Lizard0TM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! I've been awake for 25 hours to fix my sleep schedule, hopefully watching this stream can help me make it to like 9pm or something
[0:04:45] <sapphomet777> imagine paige saying shes gonna do something dry as inquisition instead of just originsing
[0:04:47] <darthtriceretops4aby> Beat the game already geez
[0:04:47] <+Scevda> Did he fix his issue with the ME3 face transfer?
[0:04:50] <darthtriceretops4aby> Jk
[0:04:52] <+Soliloquy123> @count_bob Honestly agree, the neutral options always felt utterly useless and went against the gameplay wanting you to go all in on paragon or renegade
[0:04:53] <28moogles> Mass Effect 3 is good, I don't care what Internet People say. I will die on this hill.
[0:05:00] <%Romuken> IT BEGINS
[0:05:00] <%pilgrimsayswhat> LIZARD GO TO SLEEP
[0:05:00] <GuyverTypeL> TIME TO FILL TALI WITH LOVE YE
[0:05:05] <PunchSlugfest> @anceldelambert yea, but damn is Origins great
[0:05:05] <%Lizard0TM> ME3 is great
[0:05:05] <%machshop> i can't wait til he sees Anderson run
[0:05:08] <knight_verse> Shepat will go to war with the Batarians... it will be glorious.
[0:05:08] <%Lizard0TM> NO
[0:05:09] <sapphomet777> @28moogles THEN PERISH
[0:05:13] <darthtriceretops4aby> Not the hill to die on
[0:05:14] <%Lizard0TM> I WILL STAY AWAKE
[0:05:16] <%maskofmichael> maskofmichael subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Pat, is it wrong to say that you get to have that VTussy every night?
[0:05:16] <%Rookie_Balboa> Rookie_Balboa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Oh boy ME3! I can't wait for people who have never played the game to say how it's the worst shit ever! Having beaten it recently again, I'd say it's a 10/10 despite fumbling the last 1% a little bit
[0:05:16] <%Romuken> drops?
[0:05:19] <%Dakuu75> It's not Paige's birthday anymore, we can make fun of all her jackbox spelling mistakes now
[0:05:28] <stantheman_97> 90% of 3 is good
[0:05:30] <%JamesCorck> Yeah backwards intro!!!
[0:05:33] <sapphomet777> moogles, you forget  you forget Child
[0:05:33] <+LumberjackJack> ANIMEEEEEEE
[0:05:34] <%lumporr> WOOOO ANIME OST
[0:05:34] <dd44dostivei> @machshop Anderson runs like a cactuar
[0:05:36] <%Lizard0TM> hwat
[0:05:38] <%machshop> good stream guys
[0:05:44] <%Lizard0TM> is this intro new?
[0:05:49] <secret_npc> Excited to watch and eventually hear Pat say "this is fine"
[0:05:51] <+Scevda> @rookie_balboa how can it be 10/10 if it fumbled?
[0:05:51] <darthtriceretops4aby> Big redbull
[0:05:53] <%RealThiele> he wants the big expensive video first
[0:05:53] <%Dakuu75> yeah but, this intro doesn't say "Give money"
[0:05:54] <+flying_hipp0> the fuck
[0:05:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ye this is his new intro
[0:06:00] <sapphomet777> newish? been here for a month or so
[0:06:04] <+flying_hipp0> i've been gone a while
[0:06:05] <%JamesCorck> God, this intro/outro is fucking hilarious.
[0:06:05] <%lumporr> god i desperately want to see pat Naruto Run IRL
[0:06:08] <%Shubreaker> perfect timing
[0:06:08] <Dunmarkh> @Dakuu75 that's the outro now
[0:06:09] <ExpressNode> This is the secret opening from the McDonald's VHS
[0:06:09] <%lumporr> i wonder what his price is
[0:06:10] <%Rumbutt> Mass Effect 3 ending got upgraded
[0:06:11] <%Lizard0TM> yo this shit is HYPE AF
[0:06:11] <ttc_lover> Wrong button pat
[0:06:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> And his old intro is his outro now
[0:06:16] <Meltgar> THE BONE ZONE
[0:06:16] <%cade_calrayn> I thought this was the outro
[0:06:16] <datlambo458> This opening is so dumb I love it
[0:06:16] <%capnbeefs> I will never get over the production quality for this dumbass video.
[0:06:23] <%Rumbutt> this is way better than the original oroLUL
[0:06:25] <Mattais88> Wait ME3? I thought it was mod souls tonight?
[0:06:28] <%Shubreaker> bold of you to assume Pat can still run
[0:06:30] <sapphomet777> pat arms would not allow him to naruto run he needs to hold orb
[0:06:32] <darthtriceretops4aby> War readiness baby
[0:06:33] <Dunmarkh> @ttc_lover this is the intro now old man
[0:06:37] <%mike2hands> pat is now starting with this now
[0:06:38] <+Havictos> @GuyverTypeL Too bad she's locked behind the second half of 2 and 3
[0:06:40] <%Dakuu75> Can't believe Paige's Vtuber model has that fucking Wc'Donalds hat, lol
[0:06:43] <%MrMegaJackpots> why does pat have so much hair
[0:06:45] <%Rookie_Balboa> @Scevda Because a 98% rounds up to a 10
[0:06:48] <%Rumbutt> @Mattais88 Schedule changed due to Paige borth
[0:06:56] <+flying_hipp0> wut is this fever dream???
[0:06:58] <sapphomet777> I wouldnt beive if you said it DIDNT
[0:06:59] <Meltgar> @Shubreaker Legally how fast can pat "run" if he has to charge someone?
[0:07:01] <%RealThiele> last night was hella fun
[0:07:02] <Meltgar> A dwarven sprint?
[0:07:06] <darthtriceretops4aby> Leviathan dlc?

[0:07:18] <darthtriceretops4aby> That’s the coolest name ever
[0:07:19] <%Romuken> just noticed Paige never shoots the missiles.  Is it cause she didn't read the super large tutorial ox that says "press X to shoot?"
[0:07:20] <Meltgar> COMMIE
[0:07:22] <Meltgar> Kappa
[0:07:23] <%king_wragles> Is there ever going to be a sequel to that?

[0:08:06] <%James_Quivers> Based
[0:08:08] <Treasure_Vault> Is Mass Effect 3 good?
[0:08:08] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> He did it for honour tho
[0:08:09] <%strakillias> Prepare for a shit 1st hour -hour and a half. Then the game will get good
[0:08:09] <%RealThiele> as worf does
[0:08:10] <sapphomet777> THIS IS THE ONE WHERE THE DEVS LEFT!

[0:08:29] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Treasure_Vault! They have given 444 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:08:29] <%maskofmichael> @Treasure_Vault Yes, but actually no
[0:08:30] <secret_npc> The opening is clearly for new players, but the mission after is good
[0:08:31] <%HaroldDonchee> oh wow. this'll be fun
[0:08:31] <%JamesCorck> Whaaaa
[0:08:33] <28moogles> It's a good game and the ending hate is overblown.
[0:08:33] <%NovaKnightmare> Its not as bad as it was initially but its still not good!!
[0:08:34] <+AmericanSkidd> as you do
[0:08:36] <%Rookie_Balboa> is the camera slightly delayed?
[0:08:36] <dekkitout> I started watching the original series. Question, why is a majority of the crew so inept and all around madcap?
[0:08:36] <drippinduckie> what's up big man upstairs?
[0:08:36] <+Sadira_snack_attack> can you imagine Obrien dealing with mental trauma and being treated by councilor Troy?

[0:08:38] <FassieFons> i heared about the babidiboo
[0:08:39] <sapphomet777> I cant wait to VISIBLY see where the devs just LEAVE
[0:08:40] <+Scevda> Get the item guide up preemptively!
[0:08:41] <%Wurmspawn> @Treasure_Vault Depends on multiple facotrs to whether that answer is yes or no.

[0:08:45] <%JamesCorck> There's no drama.
[0:08:46] <%andrewofbob> @Treasure_Vault Gameplay is great; story starts ok then fades out
[0:08:47] <Dunmarkh> @ItalianWaifu there's a fan archive, you can find it on the subreddit

[0:08:55] <+AmericanSkidd> the middle stuff is the best stuff
[0:08:55] <%Monkeyweed21> the game is mostly good with a really bad ending
[0:08:57] <secret_npc> You Will Have Fun Playing Mass Effect 3

[0:09:49] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> online
[0:09:50] <Mattais88> X: Doubt
[0:09:50] <+TristonObv> ME3 has the highest highs and some major lows
[0:09:51] <%trackles_64> Mass effect lets go, plz dont dlete vods again
[0:09:51] <stormhawk9891> Fuck no
[0:09:51] <+hatok> you get more Legion contrent so who can say if it's good or bad
[0:09:51] <%JamesCorck> Legendary is better.
[0:09:52] <%RealThiele> One guy
[0:09:55] <%VictorVonLouche> one guy?
[0:09:55] <%James_Quivers> why you lie
[0:09:56] <%AncelDeLambert> nah but fuck classic, tho, mod it up
[0:09:56] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I just meant that it takes me back.
[0:09:57] <+Scevda> Online!
[0:09:58] <+AmericanSkidd> sus
[0:09:58] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Mods is the only thing I can think of as a reason
[0:09:59] <%strakillias> Cause it has the multiplayer is the onlything I can think of
[0:10:01] <%Wurmspawn> Way to invalidate your point straight out the gate.
[0:10:01] <+Havictos> one guy
[0:10:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> uno hombre
[0:10:05] <mikeriffic> idk what that man is saying
[0:10:06] <datlambo458> It fucks up how you get the endings
[0:10:08] <valriot> God, one guys
[0:10:08] <%andrewofbob> We modded ME1's money and ME2's scanner???
[0:10:08] <+Scevda> Lol
[0:10:08] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Next stream download the instant scan and no reapers mod so you won't have to deal with annoying bullshit
[0:10:09] <%Lizard0TM> Also MP
[0:10:10] <%Dakuu75> ...
[0:10:10] <mikeriffic> Classic has more mods sure
[0:10:11] <%machshop> another hot take from Juan Guy
[0:10:12] <%SpcOpsBear> Classic ME3 is only better than Legendary ME3 because it has multiplayer horde mode and IT'S FUCKING RAD
[0:10:14] <datlambo458> The values are super fucked
[0:10:14] <mikeriffic> and Multiplayer but
[0:10:15] <Mattais88> The Multiplayer was amazing
[0:10:17] <%Romuken> psa1guy

[0:12:33] <Conscript_Gary> renegade pat
[0:12:35] <%Wurmspawn> @KeiganOfAstora He has never fully played through it, no. I think he's said he's played a little bit of it, but didn't get far before stopping. Than he heard all the stuff on the ending.
[0:12:35] <Meltgar> I think i heard that
[0:12:36] <%scaryboisupreme> scaryboisupreme subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 19 month streak! I get why people are skeptical about the new Mass Effect and Dead Space remake, but until I see bad gameplay I'm gonna remain cautiously optimistic. Maybe new dev teams are better for the games, who can say yet?
[0:12:40] <%trackles_64> Not in the beginning iit wasnt lol
[0:12:41] <%Treasure_Vault> I didn't know they could do that
[0:12:42] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> oh no wonder i never hear anything about Siege anymore
[0:12:45] <+Alig200> @andrewofbob they're expensive as all hell in LE ME3.
[0:12:45] <iosephe> what
[0:12:45] <+AmericanSkidd> that sounds like a poor idea
[0:12:47] <Sirtimbob> Cheer500 Hey Pat! I was scrolling on my twitter feed today and saw a video that had a skippable ad. I waited the 5 seconds to slam the skip button…only to discover the video I was waiting for was just an ad. This blew my mind for tricking me. What stupid things have got you lately?
[0:12:48] <dekkitout> I thought R6S got better? Or was this very recent?
[0:12:49] <ExpressNode> I honestly don't care about Destiny since I never played it
[0:12:50] <%Monkeyweed21> BECAUSE UBISOFT
[0:12:51] <feefer_drunk3rland> because they missed by 2 cents
[0:12:58] <+ItalianWaifu> doesnt the new op have a new AR
[0:12:59] <%Rumbutt> wow
[0:13:00] <%mike2hands> because MONEY
[0:13:01] <%somekindofsam> Some of the early side missions are time sensitive and you have to do them before Priority: Tuchunka
[0:13:03] <dekkitout> Two years? That sounds exactly like Destiny 2 then
[0:13:04] <%RealThiele> Ubisoft was worried about a SaaS game lasting longer than 2 years
[0:13:04] <darthtriceretops4aby> Massive
[0:13:07] <secret_npc> Fuck Siege, Mass Effect
[0:13:10] <%trackles_64> OPeration Health fucked things up
[0:13:11] <+ItalianWaifu> sor machine gun whatever it is
[0:13:12] <+D00msDayDan> he said no new map in 2 years and i thought he was talking about destiny for a second
[0:13:16] <%Romuken> put the Crash Bandicoot team on it
[0:13:20] <+even_the_yuenglings> side missions are time sensitive so be careful
[0:13:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> literally better to just play the siege collab in arknights Kappa LUL
[0:13:24] <+daddysbelthurts> thar ya go
[0:13:27] <%Frodiddly> Frodiddly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! nothin' to say today due to climate anxiety; thanks for the stream my dude

[0:17:39] <DatAsuna> @trackles_64 he did, yes
[0:17:43] <%teefpal> You should raise the difficulty or you're gonna stomp the whole game
[0:17:43] <%ahomeschooldropout> bro I could literally rant about how much Siege got trashed. I put literally 2000 hours into that game
[0:17:47] <datlambo458> The games poopoo garbage
[0:17:50] <+vaderxyz1970> booooooooo
[0:17:53] <%andrewofbob> So, 9.9/10?
[0:17:55] <darthtriceretops4aby> Ediusssy
[0:17:58] <valriot> 10/10 is wrong, but it is an 8/10
[0:18:01] <DatAsuna> I like it, but if you think it only bumbled a bit then it can't be a 10/10
[0:18:02] <%James_Quivers> The first level is great for ASMR if you love BWAAAAAH
[0:18:05] <%RealThiele> thats not how 10/10 works
[0:18:06] <%Ancopro> Ancopro subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! mass effect 3 more like mass effect free prime sub here you go
[0:18:06] <+condemned_15> Stream is now titled: Bulldog Piss Stomps and Space Man Pat
[0:18:07] <dawarw0lf> ME3 shill here….not 10/10
[0:18:10] <$Faustgesicht> A LITTLE BIT
[0:18:11] <+Havictos> Endings are REALLY important though
[0:18:12] <%strakillias> Fumbles the first 2% and the last 5%
[0:18:13] <datlambo458> No
[0:18:15] <+tinytinykittycat> last 10 min are THAT bad
[0:18:15] <%Rumbutt> it fumbles the last 10% A LOT
[0:18:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hell naw, without the ending, it's a 5 at BEST
[0:18:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL he said the meme thing
[0:18:18] <+AmericanSkidd> we fucked up
[0:18:19] <Blank9> mass effect is just a sliding scale for 1-3 on quality
[0:18:20] <datlambo458> The game has a lot of problems
[0:18:21] <%teefpal> The game's story and lore was falling apart by the end
[0:18:21] <dawarw0lf> It’s a strong 8/10
[0:18:22] <%James_Quivers> I say a high 8 for me
[0:18:23] <%AncelDeLambert> the majority of the game is underwhelming, and the ending is a TRAINWRECK
[0:18:24] <%maskofmichael> @DeezINC Pat totally sandbagged that VTussy
[0:18:25] <%Lizard0TM> I LOVE ME3
[0:18:27] <yourliteraldog> SUP HOMIES
[0:18:29] <GuyverTypeL> oops
[0:18:31] <%Lizard0TM> ME3 is not a 10/10
[0:18:32] <secret_npc> The whole game is an ending 🤷♂️
[0:18:32] <Blank9> gameplay one side, story other side
[0:18:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> The last 15 minutes of the game is so nonesensical that the only explanation is that it's all a dream
[0:18:33] <Profmcstevie> The very CONCEPT of pissing away the ending for a trilogy cos "oh no they figured it out" upsets me, I don't need to play it for that
[0:18:37] <+kortin> if that's a fumble, what's a fuckup
[0:18:39] <%Lizard0TM> it's like
[0:18:40] <%afronooch> they had to release dlc to fix the end of the game lol
[0:18:41] <dawarw0lf> Extended cut is ok though
[0:18:42] <ryderbootz> like a 7, id give it an 8, but really its like a 7
[0:18:42] <+BlackIronVengarl> ME3 is fantastic up until the ending then it just trips on it's own dick
[0:18:44] <datlambo458> There are some big fuck ups in this game that are not the ending
[0:18:45] <%Lizard0TM> 7.5/10
[0:18:50] <%Lizard0TM> maybe 8/10
[0:18:50] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Ending aside its worth playing
[0:18:50] <marcdyllan> authorial intent may not apply
[0:18:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Maybe to that guy it isn't that bad
[0:18:52] <+Scevda> Its a spit in the face of the players who were there from the beginning
[0:18:54] <Mattais88> I'd say 9/10.
[0:18:55] <+AmericanSkidd> Just headcanon your own ending its fine
[0:18:57] <$lotharrio> They knew they botched it. That's why they went back and revised it.
[0:18:58] <%RealThiele> Lost did that when someone at a con guessed the end during S1
[0:18:58] <darthtriceretops4aby> Rekt self roast
[0:19:01] <artoflec> its like a 7 yeah, mass effect 3 is easily the buggiest game on the collection
[0:19:03] <%teefpal> It's a game where mods that REMOVE the ending are significant improvements
[0:19:06] <%valstriam> Yeah, ending is a bit more than 1%. Still a great game though
[0:19:06] <secret_npc> Last 15 minutes are not enough to ruin an entire trilogy
[0:19:06] <DatAsuna> Playing Leviathan first changes a lot
[0:19:07] <PunchSlugfest> I always feel weird saying that the ending to ME3 never bothered me as much as it does tons of others
[0:19:11] <%trackles_64> There are people who straight up defend Anthem
[0:19:12] <darthtriceretops4aby> Yeah canon never mattered to me
[0:19:13] <valriot> Definitely doesnt shit that hard in succession
[0:19:14] <$Faustgesicht> Rewritten at the last minute by 2 people who shouldn't have been anywhere near the writing stations
[0:19:16] <Profmcstevie> Context matters, shocking
[0:19:16] <%ahomeschooldropout> The game completely falls apart after Thessia where like nobody gives a fuck about all the other planets the Reapers obliterated yet SUDDENLY WHEN IT'S THESSIA EVERYONE CARES
[0:19:21] <%teefpal> very true
[0:19:21] <$Futurecity10> nah that persons an idiot
[0:19:23] <%machshop> it definitely makes it better to binge imo
[0:19:24] <datlambo458> I feel like the revisions make it worse
[0:19:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> It would hit worse b/c your memory of the good parts is fresh.
[0:19:26] <yourliteraldog> Ending sucks but alot of plot threads do get wrapped up
[0:19:30] <%count_bob> @PunchSlugfest I agree with you here.
[0:19:34] <Blank9> 3's advertising was insane
[0:19:34] <%bravebravesrobin> The addition of an epilogue narration helped immensely Cheer500
[0:19:40] <Blank9> it was so much of a hype cycle
[0:19:40] <darthtriceretops4aby> Omni blade is cool
[0:19:45] <ExpressNode> True
[0:19:46] <$lotharrio> When you haven't been following it for most of a decade, it's not so bad.
[0:19:47] <+Scevda> “If your general audience is begging you to retcon the ending as ‘its all a dream’, you KNOW you fucked up”
[0:19:49] <%aWanderingKaivo> Yuito let an enemy combatant psyhack him
[0:19:51] <%ahomeschooldropout> I played as the girl because she's just such a bitch I love it
[0:19:52] <+hatok> ME3 has kinda been memed to be worse than it is in some ways, like games like this tend to be, where people start to find dumb reasons why actual good parts are bad actually
[0:19:56] <%Treasure_Vault> That game has one unbelievably hilarious double reveal
[0:19:56] <%Woodywoo0100> Yo
[0:19:57] <%RealThiele> yea 3 had a shitton of ohnoes reapers are here save us sherpard ads
[0:19:57] <stormhawk9891> That's why you play Kasane instead
[0:19:59] <dawarw0lf> @punchslugfest My brother just the other day told me he doesn’t understand the hate. He hates TLJ, got s8 and all the other things everyone hates.
[0:20:00] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt More than Ajna?
[0:20:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dumber than Dante?
[0:20:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> dumber than Ichiban?? @patstaresat
[0:20:03] <Mattais88> I also went Red at the end, becasue Fuck the Reapers
[0:20:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> "How stupid is he??"
[0:20:12] <stantheman_97> that's a fucking statement
[0:20:14] <%ssjklyco> I hate the guy who cries because he can't be the leader
[0:20:16] <yourliteraldog> Dumber than Kasuga
[0:20:20] <NorwegianForestCatboy> oh me oh my
[0:20:20] <+Dova573> As someone who played the trilogy back to back the ending pissed me off
[0:20:21] <Blank9> how could they block me
[0:20:22] <%Eaglestrike117> Eh, he isnt that dumb
[0:20:26] <darthtriceretops4aby> Heavy rain character
[0:20:31] <darthtriceretops4aby> Allen
[0:20:31] <ChloeFleurage> yeah, let's end this massive trilogy where all your choices are supposed to matter and accumulate into massively different endings and just boil all of that shit down into red, blue, and green. and you can only see shepherd live through the ending if you pick the worst ending and have max military readyness
[0:20:32] <%teefpal> I played ME3 for the second time YEARS later, and the gap in time helped make the good parts stand out more, but there's still a gradual de-evolution
[0:20:35] <PunchSlugfest> @dawarw0lf s8?
[0:20:36] <%pilgrimsayswhat> hey thats me
[0:20:41] <%aWanderingKaivo> He's pretty naive and gullible though
[0:20:45] <%hewlettfan96> Happy Birthday to Paige!!!
[0:20:47] <DatAsuna> It's a shame the best part of ME3 isn't in the LE
[0:20:52] <yourliteraldog> What about Ichiban  Kasuga he is so dumb.
[0:20:54] <%tizz86> had to help hype train lol
[0:21:03] <%Rookie_Balboa> The ending 100% could have been better but what we got was not the "this series SUCKS NOW" that so many people said it was
[0:21:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Guys, I haven't even PLAYED the game past Rannoch b/c I dread the ending so much
[0:21:06] <%tizz86> aww shucks
[0:21:07] <secret_npc> @chloefleurage Did you play the game?
[0:21:07] <+condemned_15> a gift to themself

[0:21:39] <%Lizard0TM> Jacob is SO LAME
[0:21:39] <%jillpilled> That's an investment to wait that long to punch him LUL
[0:21:39] <%trackles_64> THere has to be one bad charachter in every RPG
[0:21:40] <%scaryboisupreme> That's what i call a Halo Reach
[0:21:42] <datlambo458> Yeah
[0:21:42] <%pilgrimsayswhat> JAMES VEGA RULES
[0:21:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> James is neato burrito
[0:21:43] <notsoy> yeah tbh, if you really pick jacob, you deserve everything that happens to you
[0:21:43] <%lumporr> @DatAsuna like michael jordan
[0:21:43] <secret_npc> Don't write off James immediately
[0:21:43] <yourliteraldog> Jacob is bad
[0:21:44] <%afronooch> james rules
[0:21:44] <DatAsuna> James is great
[0:21:45] <mikeriffic> james is generic
[0:21:47] <+Scevda> VICTIM BLAMING?
[0:21:47] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Liam form andromeda is even worse.
[0:21:48] <%greencapps> psaDab
[0:21:48] <%RealThiele> she. . .  deserves it?
[0:21:50] <+AmericanSkidd> hes right if you choose jacob you deserve it
[0:21:51] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> James was a himbo ahead of his time
[0:21:51] <%DrTomT18> I like Jacob. He's just a totally normal dude in a ship full of werdios
[0:21:52] <%teefpal> Jacob's most memorable trait is that he cheats on your shep
[0:21:52] <+ItalianWaifu> James is bro incarnate
[0:21:52] <+even_the_yuenglings> hes straight out of jersey shore
[0:21:52] <%Blackleafx> HIMBO
[0:21:52] <+FoolsArcade> James cool? I disagree
[0:21:54] <darthtriceretops4aby> Who is his voice actor
[0:21:55] <dawarw0lf> @punchslugfest Season 8 of thrones. He’s the most I wanna say also hates everything everyone else is in agreement with. Doesn’t think me 3 ending was as bad.
[0:21:55] <$Faustgesicht> James has a rough start, but he gets good
[0:21:55] <%jillpilled> Vega is pretty great
[0:21:56] <%scaryboisupreme> James just...shows up
[0:21:56] <%shurtal> shurtal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hey Pat, have fun with Me3, may it provide you the good content.  And happy bday to paige
[0:21:56] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Vega gets way to much hate. He's fine
[0:21:57] <+tinytinykittycat> not THAT cool
[0:21:57] <%Monkeyweed21> He's durable Jenkins
[0:21:58] <dd44dostivei> james is a satire of ea's target audience
[0:21:59] <buhbuhboat> GRAVITY IS ONE MEAN MOTHER
[0:21:59] <+Havictos> James is not generic
[0:22:00] <%pilgrimsayswhat> THATS WHY HE RULES
[0:22:01] <PunchSlugfest> James is better than most human squadmates
[0:22:01] <datlambo458> Only black character cheats

[0:22:05] <mikeriffic> english guy in big ben is more interesting, Major coats in that first trailer at VGAs
[0:22:05] <%Lizard0TM> James is alright
[0:22:06] <dawarw0lf> James…is ok
[0:22:07] <%andrewofbob> Jenkins was the meathead?
[0:22:07] <stantheman_97> i don't remember much about him
[0:22:07] <+Dova573> Man Vega looks like Brian Cage
[0:22:07] <+Soliloquy123> James was made to be a CoD fan's intro to Mass Effect but he's actually kinda great
[0:22:08] <%NCC1701Dave> NCC1701Dave subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hi Pat
[0:22:09] <+condemned_15> is the Mass Effect anime worth checking out?
[0:22:10] <%Wallabri> Good Ol' Freddie Prinze Jr.
[0:22:11] <artoflec> james actually has like..some memorable moments, he's still a dumbass but its SOMETHING
[0:22:12] <%machshop> Jenkins was a big dumb marine
[0:22:12] <darthtriceretops4aby> Pull ups and fistfights
[0:22:13] <+Scevda> Vega is much better than Jacob
[0:22:13] <secret_npc> That's James
[0:22:14] <+Buzzkill983> James is best human who plays like a Krogan
[0:22:14] <+kimo313> Ashley is a dumbass
[0:22:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh they're around they just don't talk or have names
[0:22:15] <+even_the_yuenglings> best human squadmate
[0:22:15] <+AmericanSkidd> I never thought of that
[0:22:15] <dd44dostivei> james is  a GOW fan
[0:22:16] <%James_Quivers> James is the best human crewmate across the series, no cap
[0:22:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Marines are typically smart tho aren't they?
[0:22:17] <$lotharrio> I don't like James, because we got him instead of a Krogan.
[0:22:17] <%RealThiele> umm krogan
[0:22:17] <$Futurecity10> Not enough crayons onboard the normandy
[0:22:19] <Conscript_Gary> James is important himbo representation
[0:22:20] <%warpath1911> glad i got Pat to laugh lol
[0:22:20] <%ssjklyco> You mean Ashely
[0:22:21] <%Eilocke> i find him to still be pretty boring, but the least boring of the boring humans
[0:22:21] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> arguably the best human teammate
[0:22:23] <+vaderxyz1970> Isn't that Ashley?
[0:22:25] <Profmcstevie> A dumbass marine who stares at the engine and just laughs
[0:22:25] <FassieFons> james is the normal human McSoldierman done right
[0:22:25] <datlambo458> James is arguably the best human crew mate
[0:22:26] <buhbuhboat> Watch the bad James Vega anime movie
[0:22:26] <Blank9> as low a bar as it is, james is probably the best human in the series
[0:22:26] <GuyverTypeL> Vega is a bro
[0:22:27] <+LumberjackJack> James is good... for a human character. Still prefer the aliens, but he's not bad like Jacob or post ME1 Ashley
[0:22:27] <+Fooguwu> it's weird to include a "token black character" and make them the most boring, stereotype-ridden character
[0:22:27] <Flame_Water> hes dom from fnf
[0:22:28] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> It sucks that he's the Krogan replacement in terms of stats and powers.
[0:22:31] <%Ipsenscastle> @condemned_15 nope. dull.
[0:22:32] <dekkitout> There were no crayons on hand, we wouldnt know otherwise
[0:22:33] <PunchSlugfest> @dawarw0lf ahhh gotcha. I never got into GoT personally, but I understand why the last season was so dreadful
[0:22:33] <DatAsuna> James is actually a great character with his arc, and if you're femshep, he's actually one of the few characters who's actually uncomfortable being hit on and turns you down. lol
[0:22:35] <%teefpal> James is a generic shooter protagonist brought into the ME universe and I love him for it
[0:22:35] <knight_verse> Pat just saying, but you might want to look up a list of item locations whenever you reach a map, you can miss some good shit if you're not careful.
[0:22:35] <yourliteraldog> James looks like he would suck but, he is pretty cool dude
[0:22:36] <+even_the_yuenglings> NOVA Kreygasm
[0:22:36] <secret_npc> James is a human Krogan, kind of
[0:22:39] <+Scevda> Ya! And they were racist! Just like real life
[0:22:40] <+hatok> James is boring as fuck but he's actually probably still the best human squadmates
[0:22:42] <$lotharrio> ME1 had Jenkins(dead) and Ashley(dead). ME2 had Grunt.
[0:22:44] <tommyboy96> Way better than Jacob or Ash
[0:22:45] <%afronooch> yeah 200% is good
[0:22:45] <%RealThiele> BIOTIC CHARRRRGE
[0:22:45] <Mattais88> You'll See

[0:22:55] <%trackles_64> THe movie paints James Vega in a way better light than the game
[0:22:56] <secret_npc> You'll get the weight thing, Pat
[0:22:59] <Profmcstevie> Do you do more as a big heavy man when chagring?
[0:23:04] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt he means +200% as in 200% spare capcity
[0:23:04] <Mattais88> You'll see
[0:23:04] <+even_the_yuenglings> you'll see
[0:23:05] <%teefpal> @knight_verse That is actually some really great writing
[0:23:05] <%hewlettfan96> wha the fuck os Paige doing??
[0:23:05] <%afronooch> 200% is recharge rate
[0:23:06] <%DrTomT18> I only carry a shotgun and an assult rifle lmao
[0:23:07] <%Lizard0TM> Stay at 200%
[0:23:07] <secret_npc> You'll get it
[0:23:07] <gerrymond> Just pack a pistol, then CHARGE, NOVA, REPEAT
[0:23:08] <%andrewofbob> Cooldowns are altered be carrying more/heavier weapons: it scales from -200% to +200%
[0:23:09] <Profmcstevie> IS BIG HEAVY MAKE CHARGE GOOD?!
[0:23:09] <DeezINC> 200% lightness
[0:23:11] <%valstriam> Yep
[0:23:12] <%DodgeJohnson> You'll understand when you see it
[0:23:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt the percentage is the power recharge modifier, more weight lowers it
[0:23:13] <vicepresidentrichardhawk> thats good advice
[0:23:14] <+Havictos> Whose worse Jacob or Liam as party members
[0:23:14] <hippofant> <200% weight, >200% recharge
[0:23:16] <TEANTACLES> Pat are you going to play Andromeda too?
[0:23:16] <Aiutare47> That’s like impossible isn’t it?
[0:23:17] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Weapons have weight in this game, more weight means slower power regen
[0:23:19] <+LumberjackJack> Guys, chill with the tips until he actually plays
[0:23:19] <TEANTACLES> Pat are you gonna play Andromeda after this?
[0:23:21] <+Scevda> YOULL SEE
[0:23:23] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt because +200% =200% cooldown reduction
[0:23:23] <%James_Quivers> you'll see ingame
[0:23:23] <buhbuhboat> Staying at max recharge speed is broken for vanguard
[0:23:23] <%RealThiele> that stat block sounds like garbage
[0:23:26] <Saffry_Ruzin> Liam
[0:23:28] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:23:30] <%Jmann1892> LUL
[0:23:31] <%teefpal> Dead Space Extraction was good
[0:23:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> You can use any weapon on any class but they have weight,  the more you weigh the slower your cooldown on your powers. Best to use Pistol + SMG or one weapon with ultralight material mod
[0:23:33] <mikeriffic> Pat nooooooo
[0:23:33] <dawarw0lf> ACTUALLY ITS NOT THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS DIMINSING RETURNS GUYS. There is a cap on cool down.
[0:23:33] <%trackles_64> #savethequarians
[0:23:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:23:35] <%DrTomT18> Dead Space Extraction was pretty good
[0:23:36] <%Wurmspawn> Hey guys, so you remember the whole NO BACKSEATING rules?
[0:23:36] <%scaryboisupreme> Dead Space Extraction was good tho
[0:23:36] <+condemned_15> Dead Space remake has an Andromeda writer
[0:23:36] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[0:23:38] <+Vigonept> THEY COULD THO
[0:23:38] <%hewlettfan96> sarcasm lmao
[0:23:39] <%Reveresao> Story>>>>>>>>Gamplay for ME
[0:23:41] <Saffry_Ruzin> Jacob is boring, Liam is annoying af
[0:23:45] <spicyramengaming> Andromeda aint that bad, people just bandwagoned against it.
[0:23:45] <+hatok> the lower your percent the faster you can use your powers
[0:23:45] <mikeriffic> dont take it away from meee
[0:23:47] <secret_npc> Legendary Edition did gangbusters, if they make a new ME it'll probably be similar to these, at least
[0:23:47] <GuyverTypeL> They tried I guess
[0:23:48] <yourliteraldog> New Unexperinced dev teams
[0:23:48] <+AmericanSkidd> Gameplay is not what made me play Mass Effect
[0:23:49] <+cinder_chan> it has worked for plenty of games though...
[0:23:50] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah the cap is 200% lol
[0:23:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wtf is extraction?
[0:23:51] <artoflec> extraction is a much better game than what andromeda did lol
[0:23:51] <dawarw0lf> +150% is FINE FOR VANGUARD
[0:23:52] <%Ipsenscastle> Extraction was great
[0:23:54] <%PocketBearIllustrator> PocketBearIllustrator is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 3 in the channel! 
[0:23:55] <Blank9> wasn't extraction the wii lightgun game
[0:23:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> PocketBearIllustrator gifted a Tier 1 sub to Mahuloq! 
[0:23:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> PocketBearIllustrator gifted a Tier 1 sub to flying_hipp0! 
[0:23:56] <$Faustgesicht> Sweet christmas, that was a shotdown
[0:23:59] <%DrTomT18> DA3 is alright.
[0:24:01] <%Lizard0TM> what is Dead Space Extraction?
[0:24:01] <%snugglepuggs> Extraction was good
[0:24:02] <%andrewofbob> Who played the Multiplayer as Volus Vanguard Pinball?
[0:24:03] <+hatok> each mass effect game has better gameplay than the last
[0:24:10] <PunchSlugfest> But Origins tho
[0:24:11] <peachy996> Desperate Optimism I'd say fits better
[0:24:12] <yourliteraldog> Andromeda was the first game alor of those people worked on.
[0:24:13] <PunchSlugfest> that shit is great
[0:24:16] <Profmcstevie> the optimism from any studio under EA is not high
[0:24:18] <totorno> hello chat! 👋 hey Pat
[0:24:20] <+Havictos> I have andromeda is it that bad
[0:24:21] <%RealThiele> inquisition was great except for the fucking table
[0:24:21] <+shapeforn> Inquisition was okay, I just have the slightest hope for DA4 nestled away
[0:24:21] <RedPlasticCup> ratchet and clank was a new team, wasnt it?
[0:24:21] <%teefpal> The DLC made DAI's story and characters way better
[0:24:25] <TEANTACLES> Inquisition is very good but VERY long
[0:24:25] <28moogles> You ever play the Tresspasser DLC? Shit was fire.
[0:24:27] <%Garthunox> you mean the game with THE LINE?
[0:24:29] <%snugglepuggs> ME3 multiplayer is still super a,I
[0:24:30] <%Monkeyweed21> DA: I is squeezing blood from a stone for Bioware Magic
[0:24:32] <%teefpal> But overall it's forgettable
[0:24:32] <+Havictos> And I don't mean just because of the bugs
[0:24:33] <%Ipsenscastle> Inquisition was okay, but eh
[0:24:33] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt You can use any weapon on any class but they have weight, the more you weigh the slower your cooldown on your powers. Best to use Pistol + SMG or one weapon with ultralight material mod
[0:24:34] <%aWanderingKaivo> I feel like a lot of people never learned to leave the Hinterlands in DAI and hated on it based just on that zone
[0:24:34] <Mattais88> dragon Age 2 is my favourite, despite it being a trash fire
[0:24:38] <DatAsuna> yeah it's fine, it's not great either. Also fuck Solas
[0:24:39] <+ThomasOfTroy> I literally can't play inquisition and I wish it wasn;t such trash
[0:24:39] <spicyramengaming> Andromeda has some of the best feeling combat of the series, full stop.
[0:24:41] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I really like Inquisition ;-;
[0:24:42] <gerrymond> I just want a new Milky Way Mass Effect without Casey Hudson
[0:24:44] <ExpressNode> Mass Erect
[0:24:46] <darthtriceretops4aby> 1 2…….3!!!!
[0:24:49] <%andrewofbob> Bioware has made a lot of staff changes
[0:24:49] <+Buzzkill983> I am on standby as well for more information than none at all
[0:24:49] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @Mattais88 BASED AF
[0:24:50] <%hewlettfan96> Controversial opinion I like THE ME3 Ending
[0:24:51] <%teefpal> @Mattais88 brave take
[0:24:51] <dd44dostivei> an attempt will be made
[0:24:52] <secret_npc> Showing Liara says a lot tho
[0:24:54] <%ahomeschooldropout> I would totally be down with an entire Mass Effect reboot if they didn't fuck it up
[0:24:54] <PunchSlugfest> @Mattais88 how can you say something so controversial yet so brave?
[0:24:55] <%DrTomT18> If EA is really turning around its ideaology to embrace single player games, I am mildly hopeful
[0:24:55] <peachy996> That Dead Space remake will suck for sure
[0:24:56] <+Dova573> I'm currently playing andromeda right now and I dont get how people say its gameplayer is better than 3
[0:25:04] <ChloeFleurage> to be completely real, even if a new game comes out under the name of "mass effect" any of the people who worked on what you like about ME are long gone
[0:25:05] <+AmericanSkidd> That is fucked
[0:25:10] <dekkitout> LuvUok
[0:25:12] <peachy996> Nothing about that remake sounds good

[0:25:21] <%Dakuu75> Jackbox "PENIS"
[0:25:21] <%ahomeschooldropout> Andromeda has more mechanics but all the animations are so shitty and weightless it brings it down

[0:25:26] <%GarbageNirvana> PENIS
[0:25:29] <%strakillias> strakillias subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! Hey Pat, wanted to say thanks for all the streams and shit. Also going into ME3 careful talking with Liara you can accidentally lock yourself into her romance. Also do the Omega DLC ASAP b/c it gives a fun power and is a solo mission so no need for team.
[0:25:29] <%MrMegaJackpots> @Mattais88 you're right and you shouldn't be ashamed
[0:25:31] <%scaryboisupreme> I mean most sequels and prequels aren't worked on by the original team
[0:25:31] <%Monkeyweed21> you can just say Space Jam 2
[0:25:38] <%Lizard0TM> imagine not using adblock
[0:25:43] <ExpressNode> There's no adblock for mobile
[0:25:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Dova573 Saaame, 3 has such better gunplay, better, you can use more powers more often, lots more variety.. I really prefer it

[0:25:50] <dekkitout> Is BC still melting?
[0:25:56] <%scaryboisupreme> ME2 was a completely different team from ME1 and it's leagues better
[0:25:57] <%Lizard0TM> @ExpressNode yes there is
[0:25:59] <%DrTomT18> the power we all all using to watch this and you are using to stream this is probably less than fucking Times Square
[0:26:01] <%RealThiele> Florida will die first, i take comfort in that
[0:26:02] <yourliteraldog> Space Jam 2 is ad we all watched
[0:26:03] <secret_npc> The worst thing they can do to Dead Space is fuck with the lighting, but this kind of sounds like it's different from typical remasters?? Probably wrong.
[0:26:11] <+AmericanSkidd> radical
[0:26:18] <ExpressNode> @lizard0tm Really?
[0:26:20] <%teefpal> psaBlep

[0:26:42] <tanarath> @scaryboisupreme I'm gonna agree and disagree with you.
[0:26:45] <Profmcstevie> "It's about the journey" says man who hated his destination
[0:26:49] <%RealThiele> California almonds RIP LUL
[0:26:52] <%lumporr> THE CENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
[0:26:52] <%scaryboisupreme> the Dead Space remake is in the same vein as the SOTC remake, complete ground up remake
[0:26:57] <%James_Quivers> I actually know very few pieces of media where the ending was 'great'
[0:26:59] <knight_verse> The ME3 multiplayer is the best tacked on feature ever.
[0:27:00] <%teefpal> OH NO
[0:27:07] <%trackles_64> geefy destroys stream
[0:27:08] <tanarath> ME1 had a better set of missions leading to the finale.

[0:27:12] <secret_npc> the dog thing is going great
[0:27:13] <%RealThiele> pat likes that deal
[0:27:16] <DatAsuna> even less than the ios games?
[0:27:19] <gerrymond> Did yall know there's a Mass Effect Theme Park Experience with live action Conrad? It's in California
[0:27:22] <+Peacefrog7> I'm here for the characters and citadel dlc to be honest @patstaresat
[0:27:23] <sapphomet777> zanGRIEF
[0:27:24] <%Dakuu75> yep
[0:27:24] <+AmericanSkidd> i wonder if thats binary for something
[0:27:25] <Profmcstevie> That dogs gonna cost you so much in tech repairs eventually
[0:27:26] <%Lizard0TM> ME3 MP is great
[0:27:31] <%Rookie_Balboa> okay the star child SUCKS
[0:27:31] <peachy996> you will at least have fun playing the game
[0:27:33] <28moogles> :)
[0:27:34] <%LumberjackJack> LumberjackJack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Yo, can't wait to see you play through ME3. While the negatives are still really bad, ME3 also contains a lot of the best positives of the franchise. Also, there is a way to ascend Garrus and other soldiers into godhood and have them carry you. Enjoy
[0:27:37] <%Rookie_Balboa> I cant defend that
[0:27:37] <tanarath> I also felt like it went more into the more interesting races.
[0:27:37] <dekkitout> The who?
[0:27:38] <peachy996> because vanguard is radical in this
[0:27:39] <%teefpal> @gerrymond no way, that cant be real
[0:27:41] <%RealThiele> AND I WILL
[0:27:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> family family family
[0:27:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> @knight_verse It was such a surprise, like no one wanted multiplayer in ME. But then it came out and it was great
[0:27:46] <secret_npc> Pat, meet that child and tell me that's not fake as fuck
[0:27:46] <%SaiyanShoto> Complaining is the true Pat way!
[0:27:47] <+even_the_yuenglings> the star child is only there for 5 minutes
[0:27:47] <+AmericanSkidd> Good
[0:27:50] <NorwegianForestCatboy> can't wait for slow motion running dreams
[0:27:51] <mikeriffic> as you should
[0:27:51] <%Ipsenscastle> of course
[0:27:51] <%Lizard0TM> Does anyone remember the Dead Space 2 MP?

[0:27:57] <tanarath> @lizard0tm it's the B E S T
[0:27:58] <PunchSlugfest> shoot the starchild
[0:27:59] <+Peacefrog7> hahaha
[0:28:00] <darthtriceretops4aby> Doesn’t he die in the opening
[0:28:00] <yourliteraldog> ME3 muliplayer was fun distrubingly do
[0:28:04] <%Solid_Stro> Honestly there’s some good shit in this game despite the ending
[0:28:04] <valriot> True tbh :)
[0:28:08] <dawarw0lf> I WISH HE DIDNT HAVE A CHILD ACTOR
[0:28:10] <%RealThiele> abort the star child
[0:28:11] <%andrewofbob> Pat's going to shoot the Starchild and fumble into Refuse ending
[0:28:11] <PunchSlugfest> best ending is when you fail to stop the reapers
[0:28:12] <%intestinal_bleeding> god I remember we were coping so hard with the ME3 ending the indoctrination theory came about
[0:28:12] <JetpackMcQuack> I hope he blows up in a space ship
[0:28:12] <+condemned_15> he's a staaaaar child waiting in the skyyyyy
[0:28:13] <+Scevda> ME3: The olive garden of video games
[0:28:15] <stantheman_97> go back to old 40k lore where he belongs
[0:28:15] <%teefpal> sure buddy
[0:28:17] <%YakumoYomi> Starchild sucks, but ME3 isn't nearly as terrible as people make it out to be
[0:28:25] <+AmericanSkidd> Is Gief part Goat?
[0:28:26] <%lloyddboy> DOG TREE DOG TREE
[0:28:30] <dekkitout> 10 years is a long time. You sure you were the same person? tajWHY
[0:28:30] <gerrymond> @gerrymond Mass Effect New Earth, it's real, live action Conrad and 4D unique movie
[0:28:30] <%GarbageNirvana> God it has been about a decade hasn't it
[0:28:33] <%RealThiele> 40k is now robotech
[0:28:39] <JetpackMcQuack> added ending best ending
[0:28:39] <%scaryboisupreme> Gonna hard disagree on that ending narration being a good thing
[0:28:40] <spicyramengaming> Mass Effect was kinda always about the journey than the destination.
[0:28:41] <tanarath> Zangief is exploring the next frontier.
[0:28:41] <dawarw0lf> half of the reason starchild sucks (ok like 1/10) is his child voice.
[0:28:42] <peachy996> Oh man remember the endings from base?
[0:28:43] <+Scevda> All the DLC helps to shore up ME3.
[0:28:43] <%jillpilled> The Starchild is about as bad as THE BABY in Other M
[0:28:45] <%scaryboisupreme> feels more like a taunt
[0:28:46] <%Ipsenscastle> it was so close
[0:28:47] <%trackles_64> They had to ship it for holiday release
[0:28:50] <+TheotherKristian> As long as one can erase the ending in their mind, ME 3 is great!
[0:28:52] <%LumberjackJack> It was obvious it was rushed compared to ME2, yeah Sadge
[0:28:53] <%DrTomT18> JUST DRAGON AGE ORIGINS THE ENDING. TEXT SLIDE SHOW.
[0:28:55] <%intestinal_bleeding> wasn't another reason the ending felt off was because key writers left during development?
[0:28:55] <WDxDracor> Agreed
[0:28:56] <+even_the_yuenglings> the dlc helps
[0:28:56] <knight_verse> @awanderingkaivo Literally one in a million.
[0:29:01] <tanarath> Oh yeah, it would have been SOOOOOO MUCH BETTET
[0:29:05] <secret_npc> I love ME3, it just needed a little more time
[0:29:05] <valriot> Yep, theres really weird things of "oh thats weird why was it like that?"
[0:29:06] <%RealThiele> the EA story
[0:29:06] <%teefpal> Just make another ending
[0:29:07] <%ahomeschooldropout> bro can you imagine if the indoctrination theory was real
[0:29:07] <+ryuguitarfreak> That is such a big truth...It just needed more time...
[0:29:07] <%strakillias> Imagine if it shipped with Citadel
[0:29:08] <knight_verse> Gief wants to return to monke.
[0:29:08] <+Dova573> Man I'm still pissed about the dlc teamate
[0:29:09] <dawarw0lf> Like imagine if new Vegas didn’t have the slideshow. That’s base mass effect!
[0:29:11] <%Solid_Stro> @yakumoyomi Played it recently and it has some really good shit in it despite the ending, which is what people remember the most about it unfortunately
[0:29:11] <PunchSlugfest> @scaryboisupreme ending narration is when writers can't show so they resort to tell
[0:29:12] <JetpackMcQuack> The story dlc really pissed me off
[0:29:14] <peachy996> the trilogy originally ended at the normandy crash and the tell me another story about the shepard
[0:29:15] <%blistexthief> Cheer500 Would you rather spend an afternoon watching John Leguizamo movies or sit in on a dramatic reading of the entire "Cloud Mows the Lawn" series?
[0:29:16] <tanarath> But they LET it suck
[0:29:17] <%lloyddboy> day ONE: the LAST thing you see after the credits is the game BEGGING you to buy future DLC
[0:29:26] <%Monkeyweed21> BUT BIOWARE MAGIC
[0:29:28] <%bravebravesrobin> BIG FACTS
[0:29:29] <spicyramengaming> I consider the final moments on Earth before the last assault to be the actual ending.
[0:29:30] <Thepothero> Good side reaper ending was a fucking trip seeing shep go reaper god
[0:29:32] <+Havictos> @even_the_yuenglings Citadel feels like a prefect end to the trilogy
[0:29:35] <JetpackMcQuack> I sounded like an idiot for 10 years
[0:29:39] <+AmericanSkidd> Citadel gives you an ending that is acceptable
[0:29:39] <%PhysicsLB> PhysicsLB subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! This is my favorite stream on the Citadel!
[0:29:44] <secret_npc> Yeah it's pretty different
[0:29:48] <Saffry_Ruzin> 3 was made in 18 months and Andromeda was made in 6 years
[0:29:48] <datlambo458> They had 18 months to work on this
[0:29:50] <%andrewofbob> Extended Cut does lift the ending to not-total-shit
[0:29:52] <%teefpal> @lloyddboy the gall of bioware to do that
[0:29:53] <+Dova573> Never got to play citadel
[0:29:56] <datlambo458> It’s insane
[0:30:01] <gerrymond> The GB crew back then didn't play Citadel
[0:30:02] <%bravebravesrobin> Citadel DLC was awesome too
[0:30:03] <+Scevda> Ya
[0:30:09] <%RealThiele> bioware magic!
[0:30:10] <IntrepidEye> Citadel itself bumps the game up a few points
[0:30:10] <peachy996> Liara?
[0:30:11] <VentWilsn> my perspective is that if the ONE thing non ME fans know about ME3. is that the ending sucked, that should tell you something
[0:30:14] <%Romuken> adoreScream
[0:30:16] <%LumberjackJack> Director's Cut ending still sucks, but isn't the nothingness that was the vanilla-ending. Citadel DLC is everyone's headcanon ending
[0:30:17] <secret_npc> Can't imagine not getting Javik
[0:30:17] <%DrTomT18> I don't understand why they didn't completely overhaul the ending with Legendary Edition
[0:30:19] <28moogles> You had to buy it on new copies too, it was just Day 1 DLC.
[0:30:19] <%intestinal_bleeding> paige's b day? awesome
[0:30:23] <knight_verse> People really need to get over the ending, it happened and there's no changing it.
[0:30:28] <%James_Quivers> For 18 months, I think they did about the best job they could've
[0:30:28] <peachy996> Because the games make you think it's Liara
[0:30:29] <%trackles_64> gey cake
[0:30:29] <%teefpal> @datlambo458 originally they were only going to have 1 year, EA wanted Mass Effect to be a yearly franchise
[0:30:29] <+ryuguitarfreak> I love Leviathan and Citadel
[0:30:30] <%Ipsenscastle> Happy borfday Skelegirl
[0:30:33] <%intestinal_bleeding> wow the dog is going full stinky mode today heh
[0:30:33] <tanarath> There is no final boss, when the star child could have been a final boss and it sucks.
[0:30:34] <%trackles_64> get cake
[0:30:37] <%hewlettfan96> Paige makes her own cake??
[0:30:39] <%DrTomT18> Javik is an asshole but I would be too in his shoes
[0:30:40] <+ryuguitarfreak> Omega is very meh though
[0:30:47] <%RealThiele> he must consume
[0:30:51] <DatAsuna> the thing is, because he was DLC, he's the most interesting but also does nothing to further the plot. Liara is in fact the most important even if she isn't as unique.
[0:30:52] <dd44dostivei> mst3k
[0:30:56] <+zanz_san> lol
[0:30:56] <+Ches_Neckbeard> MST3k reference

[0:30:58] <%machshop> Space Mutiny PogChamp
[0:31:01] <%maskofmichael> MST3K bit
[0:31:02] <Saffry_Ruzin> Rannoch Reaper is basically the final boss, if you can call that a boss
[0:31:02] <%Wurmspawn> Mystery Science Theater 3000 Space Mutiny.
[0:31:04] <DatAsuna> Simply because the story forces Liara to do all the main plot things
[0:31:04] <%RealThiele> YEAHHH
[0:31:05] <%machshop> riffRyder
[0:31:07] <%count_bob> MST3K

[0:31:24] <%Wurmspawn> Butch Deadlift!
[0:31:28] <peachy996> Ironically Vega is not the worst
[0:31:28] <tanarath> Vega is fun, you'll like him, Pat.
[0:31:29] <%Wallabri> Big McLargeHuge
[0:31:33] <%Solid_Stro> God, James is the worst addition to ME3 c4sageLUL
[0:31:34] <gerrymond> James is the best human squadmate in all 4 ME games
[0:31:35] <DatAsuna> Big meh on explosives builds
[0:31:36] <DeezINC> biotics own
[0:31:37] <Mattais88> Citadel Boss is the hardest in teh game.
[0:31:37] <%Eilocke> Blast Hardcheese
[0:31:37] <+even_the_yuenglings> NOVA pog
[0:31:40] <%hewlettfan96> ahh mtsl3000!! haha
[0:31:41] <%machshop> @Zero_Jacks lionNice
[0:31:41] <+AmericanSkidd> one shotgun will do the job
[0:31:43] <dd44dostivei> guns are fanstistic now
[0:31:44] <retrosadness> vanguard is literallly immortal in me3
[0:31:45] <Saffry_Ruzin> Vega is actually not bad
[0:31:46] <BTR_NOODLE> @Zero_Jacks the good ol X Com days lionNice
[0:31:47] <Blank9> james is fine
[0:31:48] <%DrTomT18> Give Garrus that N7 LMG and watch him become a god of war
[0:31:48] <wolfen091> space wizard?  so a destiny then
[0:31:49] <knight_verse> Man, a lot of people on here spoiling the game already...
[0:31:49] <tanarath> Pat is going to go super saiyan
[0:31:49] <%Wurmspawn> Punch Rockgroin!
[0:31:50] <secret_npc> @solid_stro Wrong.
[0:31:51] <%RealThiele> fuck yeah charrrge
[0:31:51] <peachy996> He's actually one of the better human men compared to Kaiden and Jacob (and Liam)
[0:31:51] <+even_the_yuenglings> biotic explosions are the shit
[0:31:53] <Blank9> you're going to be a melee build
[0:31:56] <secret_npc> James is great
[0:31:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @datasuna  BUT IT GO BOOM THO
[0:31:57] <DatAsuna> @Solid_Stro Ah you confusing james with steve? lmao
[0:31:57] <+Havictos> @get Reeger carbine murder everything in close range in seconds
[0:31:59] <+tinytinykittycat> charge and nova are a busted combo
[0:32:04] <%YakumoYomi> Vanguards are so good in ME3 with Biotic Charge+Nova
[0:32:06] <darthtriceretops4aby> A SiTh lord!
[0:32:06] <%bravebravesrobin> I mean we grumble about Boomers now, imagine one brought back from 50k years ago (Javik) Cheer500
[0:32:07] <gerrymond> It's ironic that ME3 guns are great yet VANGUARD CHARGE NOVA REPEAT
[0:32:08] <%blistexthief> Garrus god of war build is the best
[0:32:08] <%DrTomT18> NO
[0:32:14] <Saffry_Ruzin> I actually liked Vega alot compared to other Human characters
[0:32:15] <tanarath> @saffry_ruzin Vega is Kaidan/Ashley but good
[0:32:15] <GustauveVIII> nooooo
[0:32:16] <IntrepidEye> Space wizard is the absolute best in this game. Too bad they never added the MP powers into the campaign
[0:32:20] <%teefpal> Citadel feels like an epilogue
[0:32:21] <%DrTomT18> Citidle AFTER Sanctuary
[0:32:23] <%intestinal_bleeding> NO
[0:32:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> MAYBE
[0:32:25] <%hewlettfan96> whyyyy
[0:32:25] <GustauveVIII> citadel after sanctuary
[0:32:27] <peachy996> Interesting placement after the monastery
[0:32:27] <%RealThiele> as chat will
[0:32:28] <%DrTomT18> YES
[0:32:32] <DatAsuna> @BallerSwagBro9k Instead, Do the ALL ARMOUR PIERCING build and shoot people through 5m walls, entire rooms away
[0:32:35] <+even_the_yuenglings> yes
[0:32:35] <+AmericanSkidd> dont worry about it
[0:32:36] <DatAsuna> Yes, last
[0:32:36] <28moogles> Just do Citadel before the last mission
[0:32:37] <%DrTomT18> Yes please
[0:32:38] <peachy996> Don't do Citadel last
[0:32:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes
[0:32:39] <GustauveVIII> you miss party members that dont show up in the story yet
[0:32:39] <buhbuhboat> Citadel last thing before end of game
[0:32:40] <%intestinal_bleeding> jk I just wanted to fit in
[0:32:42] <%strakillias> Citadel before point of no return yeah
[0:32:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> sanctuary! please give us sanctuary!
[0:32:43] <%LumberjackJack> Citadel DLC I recommend doing AFTER the ending. Make a seperate save if needed
[0:32:44] <+tinytinykittycat> yeah
[0:32:44] <secret_npc> Citadel last, then the Ending
[0:32:45] <wolfen091> citadel after sanctuary otherwise you miss mirander
[0:32:46] <%Jmann1892> Do Citadel in the post game and make that the ending
[0:32:47] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You trust me right
[0:32:48] <peachy996> Chat is trying to trick you into having good feelings

[0:33:12] <DatAsuna> I also say these people are crazy don't play citadel at all until after you hit credits
[0:33:13] <+Scevda> Lol
[0:33:13] <bob900000> Jesus christ
[0:33:14] <peachy996> Citadel should NOT be treated as the ending
[0:33:14] <$Faustgesicht> Do citadel IMMEDIATELY after the tutorial
[0:33:15] <Saffry_Ruzin> Romance Legion
[0:33:16] <+AmericanSkidd> Dont listen to us dont BELIEVE OUR LIES

[0:33:21] <Mattais88> poor Woolie got spoiled on the insulindian phasmid
[0:33:26] <peachy996> You will end your trilogy experience with Starchild
[0:33:26] <%DrTomT18> wait no
[0:33:27] <%bravebravesrobin> Pat throws Woolie completely under the bus
[0:33:28] <%Lizard0TM> LUL
[0:33:28] <rekinom> Chat spoiled the Phasmid for Woolie, chat should never be trusted
[0:33:29] <28moogles> D:
[0:33:30] <%LumberjackJack> D:
[0:33:32] <+Scevda> Make sure to Peg legion
[0:33:34] <%MidnightBurst12> WOW D:
[0:33:37] <DatAsuna> Citadel was released as the final note on Me3 and should be consumed in the context it was released
[0:33:38] <%ahomeschooldropout> Doing Citadel after Thessia makes sense to me cause every character goes on about how stressed Shepard is
[0:33:38] <CrimsonFox777> Look, Woolie tried to spoil his chat on FF14, so it's only fair they do it to him on Disco Elysium. Kappa
[0:33:40] <dekkitout> Damn
[0:33:42] <%Romuken> THEY WHAT
[0:33:45] <zhenthrim213> acciendently banged liara
[0:33:46] <%blistexthief> Chat is here to whisper lies in your ears
[0:33:52] <JetpackMcQuack> it was a ok
[0:33:53] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt So why did you romance Liara in the first place I forgot.
[0:33:56] <%MidnightBurst12> WTF
[0:33:58] <gerrymond> Reputation system, not being strictly tied to Paragon/Renegade is legit HOW IT ALWAYS SHOULDA BEEN
[0:33:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO THE DLC B4 LAUNCHING THE GAME
[0:33:59] <%TheCynicalSeth> man Omega sucks
[0:33:59] <tanarath> @rekinom god damnit
[0:34:00] <valriot> It was genuinely really good
[0:34:00] <$Faustgesicht> IF THAT HAPPENS
[0:34:01] <DatAsuna> we do
[0:34:01] <peachy996> Oh yeah Geth Primes love to choke
[0:34:01] <knight_verse> Pat dlc goes: Javick after Palaven, Omega after Citadel II, Citadel dlc after Rannoch, Leviathan after Horizon, and Citadel Party before the last mission.
[0:34:03] <stantheman_97> impregnate liara then go right back to tali
[0:34:03] <%RealThiele> Grima Chattounge
[0:34:03] <28moogles> MULTIPLAYER WAS SO GOOD I BOUGHT SO MANY LOOTBOXES
[0:34:04] <%Rookie_Balboa> That would be SICK
[0:34:06] <%lloyddboy> IRON BILL
[0:34:06] <%DrTomT18> Iron Bull is the best
[0:34:06] <%Treasure_Vault> Be careful what you're yelling Woolie got spoiled on for people who haven't seen it
[0:34:07] <4DLuvOfLuthy> I actually had a lot of fun with multiplayer
[0:34:08] <JetpackMcQuack> hard 7/10
[0:34:08] <%intestinal_bleeding> people like ME, believe it or not
[0:34:11] <Laecerelius> I'd buy LE if they brought back ME3 MP
[0:34:11] <secret_npc> Leviathan should probably be played late, too
[0:34:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> I bet he was
[0:34:12] <+ItalianWaifu> Iron Bull makes that game bearable
[0:34:13] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU COULD BE A VOLUS BIOTIC
[0:34:14] <%LumberjackJack> Iron Bull was fucking dope
[0:34:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> chill bull man giant
[0:34:16] <%andrewofbob> Reminder for @PatStaresAt: there are weapons and weapon mods that let you shoot through cover, in particular you can fuck over the the Cerberus mooks carrying cupboard doors
[0:34:16] <%RealThiele> IRON BULL IS THE BEST
[0:34:17] <%teefpal> Best companion in that whole game
[0:34:17] <dawarw0lf> JUST DO DLC ALL AT THE END. There. Fixed it.
[0:34:18] <Saffry_Ruzin> I always loved playing Awakened Collector in the MP
[0:34:22] <+cinder_chan> wait you can console in multiplayer gear?
[0:34:22] <%Treasure_Vault> Don't spoil people by telling people what woolie got spoiled on
[0:34:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Iron Bill
[0:34:23] <yourliteraldog> Suck his dick
[0:34:27] <+Soliloquy123> Actually a fascinating character
[0:34:29] <zhenthrim213> IRON BULL
[0:34:38] <$Faustgesicht> Yeah, Iron Bull was easily best character in that game
[0:34:39] <dawarw0lf> He’s cool in the Star Wars
[0:34:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ride the  Bull LUL
[0:34:39] <ExpressNode> The iron bulge?
[0:34:40] <%radda343> Iron Bull FUCKS, but only with implicit consent
[0:34:41] <%snugglepuggs> YOU CAN STILL PLAY ON PC AND IS STILL ALIVE (ME3 MULTIPLAYER)
[0:34:42] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I wanna ride the Bull. myself.
[0:34:42] <%Ipsenscastle> Iron Bull spiced up that game a ton
[0:34:43] <DSD24> Iron Bull had cool stuff
[0:34:44] <%DrTomT18> N7 LMG
[0:34:45] <%blistexthief> Suck that iron D
[0:34:46] <%Lizard0TM> Make sure to fuck Garrus
[0:34:49] <valriot> Garrus is SO BUSTED LUL
[0:34:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Highest highs Lowest lows
[0:34:52] <DatAsuna> Garrus is become death, destroyer of worlds
[0:34:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> Yeah Garrus can just kill everything by himself
[0:34:57] <dawarw0lf> I don’t think pat needs carries guys
[0:34:58] <+AmericanSkidd> You WILL be given advice
[0:35:04] <peachy996> Won't need to be carried with Vanguard
[0:35:05] <%Blackleafx> DROM LEGUABLOBLOB
[0:35:08] <RedPlasticCup> protip: vega can do everything garrus can do with more health
[0:35:10] <%RealThiele> good advice though? no
[0:35:14] <VentWilsn> these donations got a lot of ME3 copium in them
[0:35:17] <ChloeFleurage> sounds like paige bait
[0:35:19] <%Solid_Stro> Garrus enjoys the big murder, so the gameplay reflects that
[0:35:19] <%ahomeschooldropout> Sentinel is fucking OP as fuck in 3. You get busted power armor, overload, AND Biotic powers
[0:35:22] <%blistexthief> Oh no, I thought you knew what that was
[0:35:24] <+even_the_yuenglings> fanfic ResidentSleeper
[0:35:32] <%blistexthief> Don't google it
[0:35:33] <+AmericanSkidd> is it a Final Fantasy 7 X King of the Hill Fanfic?
[0:35:35] <Saffry_Ruzin> Vega and Garrus with the Typhoon can solo the whole Reaper war
[0:35:35] <%RealThiele> Cloud is more of a hero than batman?
[0:35:36] <%craigb31> What's wrong with The Pest?
[0:35:42] <%blistexthief> What have I done
[0:35:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> They kind of made everyone OP in 3
[0:35:44] <%LumberjackJack> My serious advice: be sure to clap Garrus's ass cheeks. They are dumby-THICC
[0:35:45] <%teefpal> its gross
[0:35:46] <%Ipsenscastle> ....
[0:35:47] <yourliteraldog> Engineers get turret that fucking shreds
[0:35:50] <+condemned_15> Finally watched Baz Lurrman's Romeo + Juliet. Leguizamo is great in it
[0:35:50] <+tinytinykittycat> john lequisamo was in spawn
[0:35:54] <%Treasure_Vault> Oh no why did i read that
[0:35:55] <$Faustgesicht> Look at that NSFW warning
[0:36:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Cloud mows the lawn? Wha--oh god it's another Dipper Taco Bell thing!
[0:36:04] <Saffry_Ruzin> Tali with the Suppressor is broken too
[0:36:11] <PickledParsleyParty> The ME3 story doesn't change at all if you skip the Javik DLC. He's not the most important character.
[0:36:27] <dawarw0lf> @ventwilsn I mean as pat mentioned people like what ME3 is now. It’s a a different game now. A lot how hate ME3 haven’t tried it since they first played it.
[0:36:31] <ChungusQuest> Yeah, but at least it sucks in a fun way
[0:36:37] <%LumberjackJack> LUL
[0:36:38] <secret_npc> We can talk all day about OP classes, but we all know it's Soldier baby
[0:36:39] <+AmericanSkidd> BUT HE IS THO
[0:36:40] <%Ipsenscastle> @PickledParsleyParty he was planned to be before he was turned into DLC though
[0:36:42] <%DrTomT18> fuck you hes great
[0:36:46] <$Futurecity10> He is super important oh my god fucking that guy
[0:36:47] <%andrewofbob> Jakiv enhances the story
[0:36:48] <%aWanderingKaivo> he's a god damned Prothean tho
[0:36:48] <%AzureGale> get sandbag'd
[0:36:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES HE IS
[0:36:50] <%Ipsenscastle> he was originally supposed to BE the Catalyst
[0:36:51] <JetpackMcQuack> but he should be
[0:36:52] <DatAsuna> You did say those words
[0:36:52] <ExpressNode> I'm watching Bubblegum Crisis and the robots are called Boomers
[0:36:54] <peachy996> lore wise he is pretty importan
[0:36:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PickledParsleyParty dude he has a bunch of super important conversations
[0:36:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ONE GUY
[0:36:58] <PickledParsleyParty> Fair enough
[0:37:00] <tattleworm> he make airlock joke
[0:37:00] <dekkitout> Isn't boomer from the past Khan from Star Trek?
[0:37:02] <wolfen091> he is important, cause he's an asshole
[0:37:02] <+even_the_yuenglings> fuck off one guy javik is great
[0:37:04] <%somekindofsam> He's super grumpy and cynical. I love it.
[0:37:04] <%Wurmspawn> No matter what order you do things in (I don't personally think there's a good preference), so long as you DON'T start the Priority mission AFTER Priority: Horizon, you can finish all the DLCS by that point.
[0:37:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:37:05] <%ahomeschooldropout> Thing I hate about Javik is that I love him so much I don't want to bring all the other cool people
[0:37:07] <ske1eman> No that's Shepard
[0:37:08] <knight_verse> Not really.
[0:37:08] <%Solid_Stro> Javik’s boomer talk is the best
[0:37:10] <+Havictos> thats a real shit take my god
[0:37:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Bane_Kaikyo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! Holy shit thas a lotta munths wow... crazy... So anyways, I'm really glad My Wii isn't a brick so I can attempt playing through the Metroid Prime Trilogy (I have the collector's edition with the metal case, it's dope) to hype me up for Dread. Pew Pew
[0:37:13] <DatAsuna> I think you're just using important in place of interesting
[0:37:16] <secret_npc> If you care, he is
[0:37:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> He should've been the Catalyst instead of that kid that made you want to sterilize the human race
[0:37:21] <+AmericanSkidd> Dont listen to us, that includes me
[0:37:21] <%LumberjackJack> Not to mention Javik's voice is awesome
[0:37:30] <+Peacefrog7> when is paige planning on playing? @patstaresat
[0:37:30] <+even_the_yuenglings> mystery box ResidentSleeper
[0:37:31] <knight_verse> Javiick isn't anything special.
[0:37:31] <+gksnipa> i still cant believe he was dlc
[0:37:33] <dawarw0lf> Take javik on thessia and say he’s not “important”
[0:37:34] <+gksnipa> like day one
[0:37:36] <valriot> But Javik cool unlike anything in Halo 4 and 5
[0:37:40] <%Ipsenscastle> @GarbageQueenEllie BIG YEP
[0:37:41] <stantheman_97> it depends on how you handle it imo
[0:37:43] <peachy996> Javik's attitude endeared people to him despite being DLC Squadmate
[0:37:43] <CrimsonFox777> I know nothing about Javik besides his quote about honor. That's pretty rad though.
[0:37:43] <%pilgrimsayswhat> agreed
[0:37:48] <%andrewofbob> Javik being an asshole does a number on Liara's perspectives
[0:37:49] <%blistexthief> Him being an asshole is the best part for sure
[0:37:50] <%aWanderingKaivo> Yeah, that aspect is fun. You'd expect Javik to be this wise sage, but he's just an asshole warrior
[0:37:50] <%NeoCre> Sup Pat, how are you doing? I’m enjoying all the pretty fog (smoke) from the massive Canadian wild fires. Reminder that Kai Lang ate Anderson’s cereal in the books when he was placing bugs in his apartment.
[0:37:51] <+Peacefrog7> don't do that
[0:37:52] <ChungusQuest> Yeah but what about that portal guardian dude in TNG season 1?
[0:37:54] <yourliteraldog> Javik exists to show how wrong everyone is
[0:37:58] <+D00msDayDan> yeah javik's way better than the didact
[0:38:00] <28moogles> People need to chill with the DLC play order before he touches the game lol
[0:38:03] <VentWilsn> @dawarw0lf i can understand that me3 coulda been changed from how it was originally, but they forgot to change the biggest blunder
[0:38:03] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt The game itself will tell you where the point of no return is so just don't worry about it.
[0:38:04] <%LumberjackJack> And we will scream, yes, we're weirdos like that
[0:38:05] <dekkitout> The rugpull of "ancient advanced assholes" is my fav

[0:38:13] <peachy996> TAKE JAVIK with you to Thessia
[0:38:17] <$Faustgesicht> His rank and knowledge is a fantastic subversion
[0:38:19] <peachy996> I cannot stress that enough
[0:38:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> DIDN'T READ THE PARENTHESES!!
[0:38:32] <%DrTomT18> no one

[0:38:40] <darthtriceretops4aby> Keith david
[0:38:40] <%bravebravesrobin> take Liara and Javik to the mission on Liara's homeworld; super good dialogue in the temple Cheer500
[0:38:41] <ChloeFleurage> literally none of the old guard are there anymore
[0:38:42] <dawarw0lf> @ventwilsn I mean but they did? Extended cut isn’t perfect but it was an attempt to fix the “biggest blunder”
[0:38:45] <%somekindofsam> Do the side quests before Priority: Tuchunka.
[0:38:46] <%blistexthief> Maybe some of the janatorial staff?
[0:38:47] <%DrTomT18> literally no one, ME4 is being made by robots
[0:38:47] <28moogles> A lot of the core writers are still there actually, it's all the project leads that left.
[0:39:01] <+even_the_yuenglings> take javik to thessia 100%
[0:39:04] <%Solid_Stro> Pat hasn’t even touched the game and chat is already screaming what to do or not do, fuck this is gonna be a mess

[0:41:42] <mr_saturday93> they actually had ideas for DP4
[0:41:43] <Tracazoid> "Then Isaac killed 30 Moons."
[0:41:44] <$Futurecity10> also heads up this game is super depressing
[0:41:45] <+Buzzkill983> DLC literally ends with EVERYONE dead
[0:41:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mass Effect 4: There is no more money

[0:41:50] <%SABiscotti> the MOON
[0:41:52] <+Havictos> dead space 3 was you're fucked the end
[0:41:52] <ChloeFleurage> because deadspace was an exercise in "how much can we pigeon hole our horror series into an action series before it dies"
[0:41:52] <scrumbotime> Please make shepard a freakbeast

[0:42:04] <M0untain_wolf> Dead space ended with the Ultra bad end of "Everyone fucked"
[0:42:04] <dawarw0lf> Oh how bad is he going to look
[0:42:11] <mr_saturday93> Funny enough they had ideas for a bittersweet ending for a dead space 4
[0:42:15] <dawarw0lf> Blue and red for good and bad!
[0:42:19] <ChungusQuest> Dark blue aesthetic: Paragon, but kinda tired

[0:42:34] <DatAsuna> You can afford to turn it up one
[0:42:34] <spicyramengaming> Normal is pretty damn easy.
[0:42:35] <%teefpal> VETERAN or HARDCORE
[0:42:35] <28moogles> Normal is good, Hardcore is pretty tough.
[0:42:37] <dawarw0lf> It’s not. All of them are easier!
[0:42:37] <valriot> Do Hardcore, the combat is WAY BETTER
[0:42:39] <tanarath> Veteran
[0:42:42] <+even_the_yuenglings> its so easy esp with vangaurd
[0:42:42] <%Ipsenscastle> hardcore is about right
[0:42:44] <+Peacefrog7> thats true
[0:42:45] <+Havictos> not true
[0:42:45] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Oh right, they took out veteran here

[0:42:51] <%Lizard0TM> in classic there was veteran
[0:42:52] <GustauveVIII> insanity hard at the beginning
[0:42:52] <%SABiscotti> Normal is easy
[0:42:53] <%intestinal_bleeding> ZONK mode
[0:42:54] <+Peacefrog7> hardcore
[0:42:55] <DSD24> Insanity is fun
[0:42:56] <%NitronStreams> play in the mode that makes all the choices for you Kappa
[0:42:57] <M0untain_wolf> hardcore!
[0:42:57] <%jillpilled> narrative LUL

[0:43:01] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Insanity is not FUN

[0:43:15] <%andrewofbob> Insanity will stab you through the chest a few times
[0:43:15] <%NeoCre> Corehard
[0:43:18] <+Alig200> god bless the options for removing helmets during conversations or even gameplay.
[0:43:19] <%RealThiele> those difficulties just sound like damage sponging
[0:43:20] <M0untain_wolf> No limits!
[0:43:22] <DSD24> Hardcore to the max
[0:43:26] <+Goraka91> What
[0:43:26] <%hewlettfan96> WHAT DID HE DO?
[0:43:27] <spicyramengaming> Kai Leng plays on Narrative
[0:43:27] <dawarw0lf> Just the first missions will be kinda hard but it will even out for sure
[0:43:27] <%Wurmspawn> @abrupt_abe That's how Paige hiccups.
[0:43:28] <+Chaos_Aether> Auto Level up : ON
[0:43:28] <tommyboy96> I hate these menu colours for some reasons
[0:43:29] <+even_the_yuenglings> no decisions LuL
[0:43:32] <%SABiscotti> Hardcore is like Normal+, but Vanguard makes it lol
[0:43:32] <%intestinal_bleeding> NO thinking
[0:43:33] <%Aleate> No Decisions tfuPout
[0:43:36] <scrumbotime> Who in god's name would go Auto Level Up and No Decisions
[0:43:38] <4DLuvOfLuthy> "play the game for me"
[0:43:40] <%jillpilled> Wait what is that setting, like it decides FOR YOU?
[0:43:41] <%YakumoYomi> It's for people that just want to do the shootbangs
[0:43:41] <%hewlettfan96> Did Zangief fart and make her ill
[0:43:42] <knight_verse> The big baby doesn't want to play insanity.
[0:43:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> the helmet options are great in 3 tbh
[0:43:44] <%LumberjackJack> Best options ever
[0:43:45] <zhenthrim213> just dont play the game button
[0:43:46] <%Ipsenscastle> no decision Mass Effect is so deviant
[0:43:47] <+Havictos> yes
[0:43:48] <Profmcstevie> Everybody take it off~
[0:43:51] <ianabstract> They were scared of conversation choices weirding out the mainstreeam audience so they made them mean nothing
[0:43:51] <+condemned_15> I'm Dumb. NO DECISIONS
[0:43:52] <+Scevda> Journalist mode
[0:43:53] <Laecerelius> Take that helmet off during a conversation in space
[0:43:54] <+Havictos> off in convos
[0:43:56] <+even_the_yuenglings> I like the helmets
[0:43:59] <%trackles_64> @scrumbotime  Game Journalists
[0:44:00] <+AmericanSkidd> I HATE that setting is there
[0:44:03] <%ahomeschooldropout> off in coversations means you have your helmet on in game but not during convos
[0:44:04] <dawarw0lf> Yeah. It counts breather masks
[0:44:09] <dd44dostivei> take helmet off, never holster gun
[0:44:12] <%AJ_Cherenkov> oh hey, you can kinda hear the me1 menu theme, like real quiet in the background hre
[0:44:14] <datlambo458> It’s because EA wanted cod bros to play the game
[0:44:16] <dawarw0lf> Liars is dumb with a “helmetl
[0:44:19] <secret_npc> The helmets look sick tho aw

[0:49:14] <peachy996> This is such a non-option
[0:49:15] <DatAsuna> It's not renegade, hence it not being red
[0:49:16] <%Wurmspawn> You jsut got done saying "you look like shit"
[0:49:17] <%DrTomT18> "house arrest"
[0:49:21] <ShiningAxis> the paragon and renegade is a tiny bit different in 3
[0:49:22] <%blistexthief> He's missing the charismatic orb
[0:49:23] <RoldanDgr8> Bald shepard
[0:49:24] <$lotharrio> Dead for a year or so, in fancy jail for six months.
[0:49:26] <%andrewofbob> 300000 dead batarians, go to jail
[0:49:27] <+AmericanSkidd> thats funny coming from you shepard
[0:49:28] <dd44dostivei> i prepped by killing the batarians that deserved it
[0:49:29] <secret_npc> RENEGADE in 3 is wayyyyy more grey
[0:49:30] <%jillpilled> Renegade "Yeah :) "
[0:49:31] <LunarRemix> The game's a little low
[0:49:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's not always a matter of renegade-paragon
[0:49:34] <AxelCezar> bitterLUL bitterLUL bitterLUL
[0:49:35] <%DrTomT18> Btw Pat, this is Canada!
[0:49:36] <M0untain_wolf> That goo is future water
[0:49:37] <+OG_M_Bison> This game got rid of the neutral options @PatStaresAt . A lot of it is just renegade and paragon choices
[0:49:39] <+FennecZephyr> Wait, is Anderson the same VA as Zavala?
[0:49:41] <SaltyAzteca> OOF
[0:49:43] <%machshop> GOOD
[0:49:44] <TourettesPlays> Paragon/Renegade goes out the fucking WINDOW in this game it does not matter
[0:49:44] <$lotharrio> IF ONLY MORE DIED!

[0:49:47] <%RealThiele> also aborteda reaper baby
[0:49:47] <%scaryboisupreme> Honestly are they ANY body cameras in this universe
[0:49:48] <%AzureGale> F for Lilith
[0:49:48] <spicyramengaming> Renegade dialog options are not always red, just interrupts
[0:49:49] <%lloyddboy> WARCRIMES YEAH
[0:49:49] <mr_saturday93> Ya genocide!
[0:49:51] <$lotharrio> I'D KILL THEM ALL IF I COULD!
[0:49:51] <%strakillias> Imagine if you didn't do arrival
[0:49:51] <ttc_lover> Game is way too quiet
[0:49:52] <%SABiscotti> This is Vancouver BC
[0:49:52] <%AncelDeLambert> I want to know how they had the authority to do that when you were still technically KDA
[0:49:54] <%Lizard0TM> @PatStaresAt Jesus that face, ME3 Patron is the missing link
[0:49:54] <+OG_M_Bison> THEN WHY BRING IT UP???
[0:49:55] <stormhawk9891> No
[0:49:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> A tad

[0:49:58] <%scaryboisupreme> How the fuck does shepard have NO video evidence
[0:49:58] <%machshop> it's fine
[0:49:58] <Maids4lyfe> @FennecZephyr no different actor
[0:49:58] <+Buzzkill983> Should've gotten a medal for hundreds of thousands of Batarians dead
[0:49:58] <%Aleate> Its kinda low
[0:49:59] <+Goraka91> My only regret was not killing them all
[0:49:59] <%Wurmspawn> No volume is fine.
[0:49:59] <peachy996> Nobody touches my backdoor

[0:50:16] <DatAsuna> @DrTomT18 the US state of canada, vancouver
[0:50:16] <secret_npc> Kaidan baby
[0:50:19] <%machshop> "not kelly"
[0:50:20] <SaltyAzteca> LOOK ITS SOAP
[0:50:21] <VentWilsn> i thought that was Kelly
[0:50:23] <4DLuvOfLuthy> Best boi!
[0:50:23] <DSD24> Eyy its Kaiden!
[0:50:26] <%Ipsenscastle> that lady looks more like Kelly than new Kelly
[0:50:27] <+AmericanSkidd> oh, its you
[0:50:27] <%LumberjackJack> Hey, Kaiden
[0:50:29] <%trackles_64> Kainden Alenko
[0:50:29] <ChungusQuest> Dirk Vanderhuge
[0:50:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> or rather, the dialogue is good but everything else is a bit low
[0:50:31] <%Aleate> SHEPERD
[0:50:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYYEYEYEY
[0:50:33] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder if that line about the batarian relay even comes up if you didn't do the Arrival DLC
[0:50:33] <Laecerelius> Hey, it's Boring McHuman
[0:50:34] <%DrTomT18> If memory serves me right, this is in Vancouver!
[0:50:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Eww look it's Ross
[0:50:35] <tattleworm> kaiden give reave pls
[0:50:35] <Lancaster_H> BLAST HARDCHEESE
[0:50:35] <+condemned_15> Roll Fizzlebeef!
[0:50:38] <+tinytinykittycat> nope
[0:50:43] <%AncelDeLambert> oh wow he looks like SHIT
[0:50:44] <%Zeif00> Such a psaBig chest on that one
[0:50:45] <%trackles_64> Pt old
[0:50:46] <%Rookie_Balboa> I'll say that I thoroughly enjoy Shepard's dialogue in this game, he's a lot more of his own character than the previous 2
[0:50:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Hello Bread.
[0:50:50] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt By the way kaidan acts real catty for bit
[0:50:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> Right this is where you find out Ashley got all Sexed up for ME3
[0:50:51] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAAACE
[0:50:53] <+Goraka91> Those are literally the same option
[0:50:53] <RoldanDgr8> Kaiden gets no glow up
[0:50:58] <%andrewofbob> @DrTomT18 It is, there's even a multiplayer map in the city
[0:50:59] <+condemned_15> TRUNK SLAMCHEST
[0:50:59] <knight_verse> UGH, it's Kaidan, quick kill it with fire.
[0:51:00] <valriot> I like Kaiden in ME3
[0:51:00] <dawarw0lf> He nicer then bitch Ashley
[0:51:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES SO MUCH BETTER THAN ASHLEY
[0:51:01] <%GabeSweetMan> I do NOT like the faces in 3.
[0:51:02] <secret_npc> You can be Renegade worh Kaidan, it's actually neat
[0:51:03] <%SABiscotti> Kaidan is so much better than Ash in this
[0:51:05] <peachy996> Weird how Ashley is the Spectre in 3 but Kaiden isn't
[0:51:06] <%RealThiele> Flint Ironstag!
[0:51:07] <%pilgrimsayswhat> sincere or chiding
[0:51:07] <DSD24> Ashley gets a worst haircut
[0:51:08] <%machshop> Ashley's makeover for this game is fuckin frightening
[0:51:15] <%subparSamaritan> Is the in-game lip syncing kind of off for anyone else?
[0:51:17] <%LumberjackJack> Ashley looks AWFUL in ME3, dunno what they were thinking
[0:51:19] <%DrTomT18> Kaiden was already perfect. Ashley remains the worst ever
[0:51:19] <+Goraka91> monkaS
[0:51:19] <+Chaos_Aether> Our ear are going to get blown out when the reaper come
[0:51:20] <DSD24> Uh ok
[0:51:20] <%Aleate> @goose_attack_almanac They sexed her up hard, its terrifying
[0:51:22] <DSD24> oh
[0:51:23] <Oqzar> faces are fine
[0:51:23] <stormhawk9891> Kaiden's cool in this game
[0:51:23] <tattleworm> be nice to kaiden, he is a vehicle for reave
[0:51:24] <dawarw0lf> The eyes are the worst
[0:51:24] <+polothegreatest> tired pat
[0:51:24] <%ahomeschooldropout> Ashley is Bimbofetish bait
[0:51:25] <dd44dostivei> stream over
[0:51:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> d i n g
[0:51:26] <secret_npc> That's why you don't customise in ME
[0:51:28] <%conchthechimera> All of Pat Shep's Gingeriness is gone
[0:51:29] <Profmcstevie> They're a little...blobby?
[0:51:30] <Laecerelius> Ashley got all bimbofied
[0:51:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Hey, let's slap lipstick on this pile of SHIT"
[0:51:32] <stormhawk9891> I thought that was me
[0:51:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Something about the skin under the eyes and around the nose is just slightly off.
[0:51:33] <VentWilsn> @goose_attack_almanac i did remembered ashley's haircut in ME3
[0:51:33] <%AzureGale> This is a screenshot
[0:51:34] <ExpressNode> Did it freeze?
[0:51:34] <%SABiscotti> The only good thing about Ashley in this is her and Vega hook up in a DLC
[0:51:35] <peachy996> Because Kaiden is better suited to Spectre work than Ash who is better suited to the alliance.
[0:51:35] <%LumberjackJack> The eyes are the worst. Like Andromeda
[0:51:36] <mikeriffic> some faces tranfer over better then others...
[0:51:36] <%DrTomT18> Fuck Ashley that is all
[0:51:36] <%watts121> Sad that we get to miss Ashley's bimboification
[0:51:37] <TourettesPlays> @Rookie_Balboa Play it again and you might notice that at many point Shepard speaks and will say both a Paragon and a Renegade thing, the direction the player has over him is thrown out the window
[0:51:39] <Aiutare47> They all look greasy
[0:51:42] <%JohnAtDawn> They made Ashley look like Miranda
[0:51:43] <Alkiryas> what class did he pick?
[0:51:46] <ske1eman> @peachy996 What? No their ranks are just different, neither gets the specte offer til later in the game
[0:51:46] <M0untain_wolf> 2!!!
[0:51:49] <knight_verse> Kaidan acts like scorned ex in this game, Ashley makes a lot more sense for this.
[0:51:50] <%Garthunox> Pat, in this one top and bottom dont really reflect paragon and renegade, so go with whatever, the red and blue options are still obviously hard either way
[0:51:55] <+Bigbossman91> @peachy996 both become Spectres after the coup
[0:51:57] <spuginky> where GINGE
[0:51:57] <ChungusQuest> So chat, we're committed to those names every time Vega shows up on screen, right?
[0:51:58] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Alkiryas Vanguard
[0:51:59] <M0untain_wolf> These arnt para or ren options
[0:52:02] <+Scevda> But they still changed the engine version so ya, totally different effect
[0:52:09] <peachy996> Ah yeah
[0:52:09] <secret_npc> The dialogue is more grey for both
[0:52:10] <+Goraka91> ???
[0:52:11] <M0untain_wolf> YES
[0:52:11] <stormhawk9891> Yup
[0:52:11] <karl_rex> Thats a lie
[0:52:12] <thewrathofscience> doggo
[0:52:13] <tommyboy96> WRONG
[0:52:14] <%DrTomT18> some are just rude and not rude
[0:52:17] <+AmericanSkidd> not always
[0:52:17] <SaltyAzteca> CHANGES
[0:52:18] <+tinytinykittycat> sometimes
[0:52:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wrong
[0:52:21] <%Dakuu75> true?
[0:52:22] <Dre_> thats not true
[0:52:22] <+Havictos> @knight_verse At least he only does it until after mars
[0:52:22] <Mattais88> Sort of, it's one combined reputation bar
[0:52:23] <%Lizard0TM> that's only partly true
[0:52:24] <%Ipsenscastle> eh
[0:52:24] <%Shubreaker> one guy
[0:52:25] <knight_verse> Not always.
[0:52:25] <Alkiryas> @aWanderingKaivo charrrgeeeeee!
[0:52:25] <Profmcstevie> Prove it
[0:52:26] <%RealThiele> not always
[0:52:27] <%watts121> THEY STILL DO PAT
[0:52:29] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Sometimes it's just flavor, but that is otherwise bullshit
[0:52:29] <M0untain_wolf> So ture
[0:52:30] <mr_saturday93> CHANGES and sometimes
[0:52:30] <%count_bob> Lie.
[0:52:30] <%weissguard> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[0:52:33] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Just say whatever you wanna say
[0:52:33] <karl_rex> Thats a lie it affects interrupts
[0:52:33] <RedPlasticCup> paragon/renegade doesnt matter in this one
[0:52:33] <secret_npc> There are Paragon and Renegade points
[0:52:34] <+Peacefrog7> it changes throughout the game
[0:52:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> @VentWilsn she also got larger, glossier lips and longer lashes and make up. And boobier armour
[0:52:36] <+Scevda> ONE GUY
[0:52:36] <28moogles> It's complicated, there's para and rene choices, but also just base reputation.
[0:52:36] <gerrymond> SOME are neutral, SOME DO REFLECT IT
[0:52:37] <retrosadness> they do for the most part
[0:52:37] <TourettesPlays> Pat compared to 1 and 2 there are BARELY any dialogue choices in 3 it kind of sucks
[0:52:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt Paragon and Renegade don't matter as much in 3, they combine to form your overall reputation score or whatever its called
[0:52:40] <tattleworm> there are also times where just auto picking paragon will screw you over
[0:52:41] <%SABiscotti> They still do MOST of the time
[0:52:42] <ShiningAxis> 3 isn't strict about paragon and renegade like the other two
[0:52:46] <%Garthunox> its not 100% either way
[0:52:47] <%Aleate> Not ALWAYS, but often they don't matter iirc
[0:52:47] <ChungusQuest> SMASH LAMPJAW
[0:52:47] <+condemned_15> ew
[0:52:47] <dekkitout> Why aren't they labeled?
[0:52:47] <+AmericanSkidd> better
[0:52:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kaidan's hair still looks like SHIT
[0:52:51] <zhenthrim213> good
[0:52:51] <M0untain_wolf> kinda low still
[0:52:52] <Dunmarkh> can't tell the difference
[0:52:53] <%ahomeschooldropout> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[0:52:53] <%NitronStreams> sound good
[0:52:54] <buhbuhboat> No its just that paragon and renagade points go towards the same meter
[0:52:54] <LorcaNomad> better
[0:52:55] <+condemned_15> touch butts
[0:52:55] <%andrewofbob> Pretty much the same
[0:52:55] <knight_verse> @havictos Only because he spends half the game in a coma.
[0:52:55] <%RealThiele> nuked corpse
[0:52:55] <%MidnightBurst12> good
[0:52:56] <%Monkeyweed21> good
[0:52:56] <%Wurmspawn> Sound was fine before, but it's fine still.
[0:52:57] <ttc_lover> Not really changed
[0:52:57] <+akscully> kaidan giving you the eyes
[0:52:57] <+tinytinykittycat> good
[0:52:57] <churropoppa> Still a bit low
[0:52:59] <TourettesPlays> @ShiningAxis and thats why it SUCKS
[0:53:01] <%Lizard0TM> treat Kaidan like shit
[0:53:02] <secret_npc> Bit more
[0:53:03] <%Lizard0TM> fuck him
[0:53:05] <%LumberjackJack> Wrong. Still Paragon and Renegade choices, only that the reputation is combined into one meter rather than 2 seperate ones. Allows more RP-ing
[0:53:05] <dawarw0lf> Wait until loud noises
[0:53:06] <28moogles> It sounds fine
[0:53:07] <mikeriffic> only mild
[0:53:08] <$lotharrio> It was the most mild terrorism.
[0:53:08] <M0untain_wolf> no u
[0:53:08] <wolfen091> when did kaidan become fucking batman, whats with that voice
[0:53:08] <%Aleate> k
[0:53:09] <+Scevda> Good
[0:53:10] <Dunmarkh> sounds good
[0:53:11] <28moogles> It's loud as hell
[0:53:11] <%Blackleafx> A bit of terrorism and tomfoolery
[0:53:12] <PanicSwytch> Don't believe One Guy
[0:53:12] <blackjack8182> u suck Kaiden
[0:53:13] <+condemned_15> "I used to fuck him too"
[0:53:13] <mikeriffic> its good
[0:53:13] <%scaryboisupreme> I think this is an "ignore chat" moment
[0:53:14] <%Ipsenscastle> it's more that the dialogue isn't always necessarily moral options
[0:53:16] <%AncelDeLambert> these snap-zooms are goddamn STUPID
[0:53:17] <+EmptyMug> It's good
[0:53:18] <mr_saturday93> Remember ppl: Emily Wong died in a twitter post
[0:53:18] <%LeiaSkynoober> That's good ty
[0:53:19] <+AmericanSkidd> everyone in this room is a hoe
[0:53:22] <%Ynkubus_> now its good
[0:53:22] <%MidnightBurst12> oh god
[0:53:25] <%trackles_64> we told u fuckers
[0:53:25] <%DrTomT18> "Reapers are here and we are all gonna die."
[0:53:26] <%HaroldDonchee> is shepherd still a spector?
[0:53:27] <stantheman_97> YOU never partook in the terrorism
[0:53:28] <%Treuan> Situation: Shits fucked
[0:53:28] <+ThomasOfTroy> This is legit one of my favorite scenes in gaming
[0:53:29] <dawarw0lf> @lumberjackjack Exactly. It was too help not dumb down.

[0:53:38] <4DLuvOfLuthy> If only they had been warned...
[0:53:38] <%Torus1025> It's ALL gone
[0:53:38] <%LochieXCIX> it's the motherfucker committee
[0:53:40] <tommyboy96> It's not terrorism if it's Batarians
[0:53:40] <SaltyAzteca> Doesnt that mean theyre RIGHT THERE
[0:53:44] <blackjack8182> Karl Reeger also died on twitter
[0:53:45] <+Havictos> I love how they're shitting their pants
[0:53:48] <%machshop> Ah yes, "Reapers"

[0:53:56] <%greasypete00> shoot gun at them
[0:53:58] <+EmptyMug> Shepard still sounds insane
[0:53:59] <DSD24> That is about tactics
[0:54:00] <%teefpal> That is such a dumb line
[0:54:00] <%AzureGale> AH YES, "REAPERS"
[0:54:02] <mikeriffic> time to tell them how they all fucked up
[0:54:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> World governments being inept and ignoring global threats? IMAGINE THAT

[0:54:09] <ChungusQuest> What is it with Councils and being useless and dying?
[0:54:09] <Alkiryas> "reapers"
[0:54:12] <TourettesPlays> Does ME lore ever explain how it took humanity so long to discover the Relay in our Solar System?????
[0:54:15] <SaltyAzteca> STAND TOGETHER, POWER OF FRIENDSHIP
[0:54:15] <+AmericanSkidd> thay cant kill all of us
[0:54:17] <secret_npc> Survival
[0:54:17] <%strakillias> Listen to this pro strategy to win.

[0:58:25] <blackjack8182> Weight
[0:58:25] <Laecerelius> WEIGHT CAPACITY LETS YOU CARRY BIGGER GUNS
[0:58:25] <secret_npc> Weight = Power Recharge Speed
[0:58:26] <+tinytinykittycat> how many guns you can carry
[0:58:27] <%DrTomT18> idiot
[0:58:27] <peachy996> Weight Capacity affects power cooldown
[0:58:28] <+Scevda> Rep bonus is fine
[0:58:28] <%Torus1025> @patstaresat You have encumbrance now
[0:58:29] <dawarw0lf> Reputation isn’t as useful. As long as you do everything you’ll be fine
[0:58:30] <%SpcOpsBear> Weight Capacity is how big of guns you can bring without affecting your power cooldowns.
[0:58:30] <%RealThiele> item load LUL
[0:58:31] <%aWanderingKaivo> weight capacity = less negative effect on power recharge from weapon weight
[0:58:33] <%YakumoYomi> Weight Capacity affects power cooldown, because weapons have weight
[0:58:33] <+fetrigon> like extremely fucking peeved PunOko PunOko PunOko PunOko
[0:58:34] <+TheBlack0ni565> weight affects cooldown its op
[0:58:35] <falyden> oh boy weight capacity
[0:58:35] <+Chaos_Aether> @PatStaresAt Weight = Power Recharge time
[0:58:36] <spuginky> Vancouver just dying in the background
[0:58:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat more weapons u carry the slower your power recharge
[0:58:40] <tattleworm> good choices
[0:58:41] <$Futurecity10> NO
[0:58:41] <$Faustgesicht> Weight capacity affects power cooldown
[0:58:43] <%AncelDeLambert> goodbye, Shotgun
[0:58:44] <+gliph13> @patstaresat  can you recreate the machinima episode and shoot the reaper plz
[0:58:45] <%watts121> Charge and Nova time
[0:58:46] <DatAsuna> He said he wants to use mostly powers, so
[0:58:47] <GustauveVIII> NOVA
[0:58:50] <GustauveVIII> GET NOVA NOVA GOOD
[0:58:51] <%watts121> Max Charge and Nova
[0:58:51] <+tinytinykittycat> you can respec anytime too
[0:58:53] <%idyota> Weapons have weight that reduces cooldown
[0:58:54] <Oqzar> nova and charge is all you need
[0:58:55] <peachy996> Alright time to argue lol
[0:58:55] <%Eilocke> Pat, make sure you have a guide for missable stuff. otherwise you'll end up with incomplete side quests sitting in your journal forever
[0:58:56] <+fetrigon> how could you have done that pat? PunOko PunOko
[0:58:56] <DSD24> Power of the NOVA FORCE
[0:58:56] <williamrooster> Has future Vancouver been destroyed yet

[0:58:57] <%strakillias> Charge and nova
[0:58:58] <%Aleate> Biotic charge tfuHYPERBONK
[0:58:58] <secret_npc> Don't you want Melee?
[0:58:58] <%Wurmspawn> Weight capacity determines what types and how many weapons you can take with you without suffering static debuffs and or granting static buffs if you carry under that capacity.
[0:58:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Friendship with Shotgun ended, now Tackle is my best friend
[0:58:59] <M0untain_wolf> welp weapons will be weak as shite but power!!
[0:59:00] <mikeriffic> there really isnt a reason to worry about rep bonus @PatStaresAt as youll get enough points for everything. Also Nova go boom
[0:59:00] <+Scevda> Correcr!
[0:59:02] <4DLuvOfLuthy> Nova stronk
[0:59:03] <tanarath> @patstaresat weight is how the balance weapon use, casters have less carry cap, it effects power cooldowns A LOT
[0:59:04] <+tinytinykittycat> explosion
[0:59:04] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt This is your Super saiyan shit
[0:59:04] <%AJ_Cherenkov> nova is rad
[0:59:09] <Mattais88> Shield based nuke
[0:59:09] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Your weapons have weight that affects how fast your powers recharge; the less you weigh, the faster your powers recharge and vice-versa. You can also use any weapon on any class. Best to do pistol+SMG or one gun with ultralight
[0:59:10] <+akscully> charge and nova are your bread and butter

[1:05:45] <SiriusLeeLost> The fuck is wrong with the music?
[1:05:45] <tommyboy96> DESTROY THE CHILD
[1:05:46] <MidnightPacif1c> original me2 ui was tini and unreadable on old TVs at the time so me3 ui big
[1:05:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Fuck off Quantic Dream Child
[1:05:48] <+rafaelba93> BIO GHOST
[1:05:52] <%SABiscotti> and we never see him again
[1:05:57] <blackjack8182> Lame
[1:05:59] <Aiutare47> Fuck that kid!
[1:06:00] <+Egg0fTheKing> He's not real it's indoctrination trust me
[1:06:00] <AthenaAegis> Fuck them Star Kids Kappa
[1:06:01] <zhenthrim213> you mean MILLIONS
[1:06:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> Only thousands?
[1:06:02] <%snugglepuggs> How is the kid alive?! The building exploded and should be super hot in there!
[1:06:03] <+vaderxyz1970> YO LETS PARTY
[1:06:03] <Gelphaze> he's not real!
[1:06:07] <ianabstract> this game needs a 'dead humans' clock
[1:06:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why do shitty game devs always have to put little kids in here
[1:06:08] <%DrTomT18> NO DEFEATING THE REAPERS. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIE.
[1:06:09] <dawarw0lf> You can’t fuck them all
[1:06:11] <+Scevda> Step two in the indoctrination theory see
[1:06:14] <%CollinsOfBodom> maybe not the best time to monologue, shepard
[1:06:16] <kjb343> kid's not real
[1:06:16] <%watts121> Shepard get's pretty preachy in this one.
[1:06:17] <%AzureGale> Probably not the time to be talking
[1:06:19] <mr_saturday93> cringe
[1:06:22] <Maids4lyfe> also why did Shepard not tell Anderson about the kid?
[1:06:22] <+Soliloquy123> "Shepard was that a trailer line"
[1:06:22] <Daxalog> Get used to that
[1:06:23] <%RealThiele> "i assume no responsibility" LUL
[1:06:26] <PunchSlugfest> oh god the indoctrination theory will run rampant in during this let's play, isn't it?
[1:06:27] <%LumberjackJack> Man, isn't it great that the kid will never be relevant ever again? ... right?
[1:06:27] <%Rookie_Balboa> The indoc theory was disproved by writers
[1:06:28] <tommyboy96> @DrTomT18 and if they don't?
[1:06:28] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't imagine why we all 180d back to "fuck you, give me exactly what I'm going to say in the option."
[1:06:32] <dawarw0lf> Gamer poop has ruined a lot of scenes for me
[1:06:36] <%MightyDuckShoes> Wow. Pat looks better in this one.
[1:06:38] <+vaderxyz1970> FCK the council
[1:06:39] <secret_npc> The game picks up as soon as you leave Earth
[1:06:40] <%DrTomT18> you go the the Council and they still deny the Reapers
[1:06:40] <%Wurmspawn> What about THEY ARE SUPER ADVANCED did you NOT understand Anderson?
[1:06:41] <Laecerelius> Considering all the upgrades you figured out you'd think they would've put up more of a fight
[1:06:43] <+Ghufufin> something is wrong with Anderson's jaw, is he a hallucination too?
[1:06:44] <%c0usinv1nny> Really wanted to hear Keith David say “Shepherd! Fuck that kid let’s get out of hear!”
[1:06:45] <+TheMadeMember> Julius, let's move
[1:06:47] <%DrTomT18> yes
[1:06:48] <DatAsuna> you mean gamer poop has enhanced these
[1:06:48] <blackjack8182> Go renegade more
[1:06:49] <valriot> Actually no
[1:06:50] <+Chaos_Aether> it kinda is
[1:06:50] <%watts121> @Rookie_Balboa cuz Bioware writers suck.
[1:06:51] <%lloyddboy> nah earth special
[1:06:52] <%Higure_Yoru> Higure_Yoru subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hello Pat
[1:06:52] <%Torus1025> @maids4lyfe Fuck that kid
[1:06:52] <%somekindofsam> nope
[1:06:53] <peachy996> And it is
[1:06:53] <Mattais88> like 80%
[1:06:54] <%DrTomT18> the Baterians are already gone
[1:06:54] <%strakillias> All the capitals yes
[1:06:55] <wolfen091> nope
[1:06:55] <%SABiscotti> you would be wrong, but yes
[1:06:55] <28moogles> That is the plot, yes.
[1:06:55] <SaltyAzteca> Weeelll
[1:06:56] <M0untain_wolf> Have to get the peoples of the galaxy to FIGHT
[1:06:56] <PunchSlugfest> Remember @PatStaresAt SHOOT THE STAR CHILD
[1:06:56] <ape_hawk> youll find out
[1:06:57] <%Wurmspawn> Not just yet, but soon.
[1:06:57] <Minorou> "so it turns out you were SUPER right the whole time, but we're still not gonna help"
[1:06:57] <+even_the_yuenglings> the galaxy is a big place
[1:07:00] <%LumberjackJack> We'll find out in a bit
[1:07:00] <tanarath> You're correct, Pat
[1:07:02] <Dunmarkh> only humans have killed reapers
[1:07:02] <+akscully> reapers take time
[1:07:02] <%DrTomT18> Earth and Palavin
[1:07:02] <+shapeforn> ehhh
[1:07:02] <+OG_M_Bison> Yea earth got fucked first
[1:07:03] <%weissguard> About that LUL
[1:07:03] <+FoolsArcade> not every single system, but most of em
[1:07:03] <dawarw0lf> More than one
[1:07:04] <%AncelDeLambert> not even the Reapers have the infinite resources that would require
[1:07:04] <+even_the_yuenglings> the batarians got hit first
[1:07:04] <valriot> Reapers attack based on threat priority
[1:07:05] <+tinytinykittycat> not quite
[1:07:06] <$lotharrio> They want human goo the most.
[1:07:06] <TioXyco> nah, we are TOO important
[1:07:07] <%ahomeschooldropout> nah man they're attacking Earth first despite arrival taking place in the Batarian space
[1:07:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, they started here
[1:07:08] <dd44dostivei> and palaven
[1:07:08] <%shadowace2400> because they hate shepard
[1:07:09] <%Rookie_Balboa> Remember HArbinger said Humans were fucked
[1:07:09] <+Ghufufin> Hoomans too scary must kill first
[1:07:10] <Profmcstevie> They're hitting core locations first
[1:07:10] <ChungusQuest> "Our numbers will darken the sky of every world" -Famous Bullshit Artist
[1:07:10] <%AncelDeLambert> We're REALLY close to the rim
[1:07:10] <%Ipsenscastle> Batarians already dead
[1:07:12] <+Scevda> Correct
[1:07:12] <%Monkeyweed21> Humanity is #1 on the list
[1:07:12] <+vaderxyz1970> Harbinger has a bit a grudge
[1:07:13] <%blaccbird914> shepard pissed off the reapers
[1:07:13] <+Ches_Neckbeard> humanity shared a boarder with the Batarians
[1:07:13] <peachy996> Earth is the priority
[1:07:14] <%somekindofsam> Batarians were first
[1:07:14] <Laecerelius> They don't want to fuck the other species like they fucked us
[1:07:14] <%RealThiele> he grabbed your boob, hot
[1:07:15] <%Torus1025> The reapers hate YOU specifically
[1:07:16] <%DrTomT18> and as I said, the Batarians are GOEN
[1:07:16] <+gliph13> They spread slowly
[1:07:16] <$LightningLynx89> Technically the Batarians were first
[1:07:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Earth is first because Humanity's dick is sooooo huge
[1:07:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> Harbinger has a hate boner for Shep
[1:07:19] <%Eaglestrike117> Earth is first cause reapers fucking HATE SHEPARD
[1:07:20] <knight_verse> They haven't helped in the past, why would the Council help now?
[1:07:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is all new for Pat, right?
[1:07:20] <dawarw0lf> Na those batarins first
[1:07:21] <%Wurmspawn> Earth is AMONG the first. The Tuarian homeworld is also being attacked.
[1:07:22] <%capnbeefs> Reapers are like fuck da humans
[1:07:22] <+even_the_yuenglings> the batarians got FUCKED
[1:07:24] <%MightyDuckShoes> It's really Stupid, Pat. The focus on Earth is just the worst
[1:07:25] <Daxalog> Its only some
[1:07:27] <$lotharrio> Quick, punch it, Pat!
[1:07:27] <+daedazrael> You destroyes the relay that would have let the Reapers do that
[1:07:29] <mikeriffic> Well the batarians got hit first @PatStaresAt but they got torn apart FAST
[1:07:30] <%LumberjackJack> Incorrect. Batarians were hit first. In a few missions, we'll see the state of the galaxy
[1:07:30] <secret_npc> Batarians were first and on the way out
[1:07:31] <%watts121> Reapers attacked Earth first cuz Shepard has been kicking their ass.
[1:07:32] <SaltyAzteca> aw gawd
[1:07:33] <%idyota> Bavarian’s were first and are already dead
[1:07:33] <%Eilocke> Batarians were first but who cares
[1:07:33] <%andrewofbob> You know that political shitstorm with the baterians? Good news, it's solved: THE BATERIAN HOMEWORLD IS DEAD
[1:07:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GIANT LOBSTER
[1:07:34] <dekkitout> Sol system is at the edge of the milky way
[1:07:34] <%James_Quivers> Military centers are the first targets
[1:07:36] <%Wurmspawn> They took on the two main military powerhouses of the galaxy first.
[1:07:37] <28moogles> I love the Reaper noise.
[1:07:38] <knight_verse> No, the Batarians were first, Earth is just their actual priority.
[1:07:39] <blackjack8182> Batarians got it hard
[1:07:39] <+TheBlack0ni565> @ahomeschooldropout Shepard took out the batarians lol
[1:07:40] <%DrTomT18> I tried to do the math ones and I think there are like 50,000 Reapers in total
[1:07:40] <+AmericanSkidd> Because of you they cant do it simultaniously
[1:07:40] <+Ghufufin> You DIDNT LIke and Subscribe, Sheperd
[1:07:41] <%GabeSweetMan> That slide is STILL terrible looking.
[1:07:42] <%watts121> well technically the Batarians were in the way
[1:07:43] <blue8moon> giant alien robot squid-bug
[1:07:43] <TioXyco> why reapers sounds like massive farts
[1:07:43] <%c0usinv1nny> I can’t listen to Keith David the same way anymore thanks to Rick and Morty
[1:07:44] <TourettesPlays> Pat one of the worst parts of ME3 is that the destruction the Reapers cause is too insanely massive that the Save the Universe plot NEVER justifies itself
[1:07:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, if I wrote this game, Earth would be LAST
[1:07:49] <+Birdigalore> I love the Reaper roar SO MUCH
[1:07:49] <Javier9563> batarians are supper fucked, thessia is kinda fucked, earth and palaven are starting to get fucked super hard, sur'kesh is fine for now
[1:07:50] <%RealThiele> the shockwave from that would kill everything around it sheesh
[1:07:50] <+even_the_yuenglings> yes
[1:07:51] <%Rookie_Balboa> the reapers are SUPER petty
[1:07:53] <CISphil> These things aren't very good at their jobs
[1:07:54] <%SABiscotti> Precisely
[1:07:56] <M0untain_wolf> Oh you need like 500ps in paragon to get the Geth and Quarian good end
[1:07:56] <SaltyAzteca> BWOOOOOOOOOM
[1:07:57] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah, it does
[1:07:57] <Maids4lyfe> YOU WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM BEING SMALL IS THAT SMALL PAT?
[1:07:57] <+fetrigon> real good sense of scale
[1:07:58] <ianabstract> the orphan grinder can only go so fast
[1:08:01] <AluxStreams> The Inception bwomp as the Reapers' motif works only for this imo.
[1:08:01] <+tinytinykittycat> yeah
[1:08:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> I know it's silly for me to think, but that Reaper displaced NO water
[1:08:02] <peachy996> I loved the Reaper noises until the Galaxy Map made me sick of them
[1:08:03] <Dunmarkh> ow your fucking neck
[1:08:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> Depends on how many ships they have
[1:08:06] <+Chaos_Aether> The Prothens Took a Long time
[1:08:06] <ThatGuyThere03> hence why you come back later
[1:08:06] <+OG_M_Bison> Legs would totally be broken
[1:08:09] <mikeriffic> @KeiganOfAstora Moooostly, he knows the ending contorversy, some bits here and there but not much
[1:08:09] <%aWanderingKaivo> their goal isn't to blow up planets, their goal is to harvest everyone and leave the planets for new life to evolve
[1:08:09] <secret_npc> Frieza could do it
[1:08:09] <Oqzar> they harvest. takes much longer
[1:08:10] <+akscully> welcome to javik's story
[1:08:12] <%RealThiele> 8 bilion meatbags is a lot of grinding
[1:08:14] <valriot> Youll find out, the Reaper attack is NOT a short process and goes on for a LONG TIME
[1:08:16] <%watts121> you would at least have a broken wrist from that fall
[1:08:16] <%DrTomT18> Yeah pat, Reaper Harvests take centuries
[1:08:17] <wolfen091> their goal is harvest not mass destruction, they only doing this to military spots
[1:08:18] <SaltyAzteca> Go to the burger town!
[1:08:20] <+tinytinykittycat> you can level up anderson
[1:08:22] <falyden> I look that exploding ship part
[1:08:24] <blue8moon> why don't the reapers shoot at the planet from space instead of landing on it?
[1:08:26] <%GabeSweetMan> WHEN IS THE BATHTUB STREAM SHEPARD?
[1:08:28] <+Ghufufin> i mean if the reapers were serious couldnt they just drop rocks from orbit?
[1:08:28] <+even_the_yuenglings> BATARIAN HUSKS
[1:08:29] <falyden> love*
[1:08:29] <%NateyBeak> BATARIANS
[1:08:30] <%LumberjackJack> RAMIREZ, GET UP AND SHOOT THOSE CANNIBALS
[1:08:30] <TourettesPlays> What up John Freeman 1 and John Freeman 2?
[1:08:30] <karl_rex> Say hi to the Batarians
[1:08:31] <tommyboy96> BATARIANS
[1:08:32] <%andrewofbob> The baterian homeworld flaunted being really powerful North Korea style, so the reapers were like "Just in case you're telling the truth, you die first"
[1:08:33] <%SABiscotti> And there's what's left of the Batarians
[1:08:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SHOOT BATTARIAN
[1:08:34] <+Ches_Neckbeard> the Reapers initial strategy appears to be overwhelm the isolated fleets before they can muster
[1:08:35] <peachy996> Batarian Husks
[1:08:35] <AluxStreams> Time to shoot some batarian zombies. :)
[1:08:37] <ChungusQuest> #NotAllBatarians
[1:08:40] <blackjack8182> Defend burger town Shepard
[1:08:41] <mikeriffic> this is what become of the Batariens
[1:08:41] <Profmcstevie> STINKIN BATARIANS
[1:08:43] <%NateyBeak> OH NO, NORMAL BATARIANS
[1:08:46] <%watts121> I mean if it's like Witcher 3 this may be people's first game
[1:08:46] <$LightningLynx89> BATARIAN ZOMBIES
[1:08:46] <knight_verse> Pat, read the Codex entry about the Batarian home planet.
[1:08:47] <DSD24> Feels good to shoot
[1:08:47] <%Rumbutt> THOSE ARE BATARIAN HUSKS GET EM
[1:08:48] <Mattais88> Rememebr how cool it was in Gundam where no one blew up a mech in atmoshpere because the power supply would fuck everything up big time?
[1:08:50] <%Wurmspawn> Thyey didn't expect new fans to play the older games first.
[1:08:51] <%Aleate> Look at that boi shimmering around cover
[1:08:51] <%DrTomT18> these are the Batarians.
[1:08:51] <peachy996> Reaper Husk designs were great
[1:08:52] <%RealThiele> #especiallybatariansthough
[1:08:53] <%Caped_Eggy> LUL
[1:08:53] <%CollinsOfBodom> Batarian Killer 3
[1:08:54] <Conscript_Gary> even in death, we get to kill batarians
[1:08:54] <%James_Quivers> Yeah, Virgil in ME1 mentions how the Reapers took centuries to fully exterminate the Protheons, they are slow and methodical
[1:08:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> I can't believe Batarians became more repulsive
[1:08:56] <Shade075> Batarian hushs are slightly more evil than normal batarians
[1:08:59] <%LumberjackJack> RAMIREZ
[1:09:00] <valriot> MAN MW2 WAS GREAT
[1:09:00] <+Scevda> Nope! Hand
[1:09:00] <falyden> bastards in live and in death
[1:09:01] <+even_the_yuenglings> what batarians? KILL THEM ALL
[1:09:02] <SaltyAzteca> WHERE'S DUNN
[1:09:04] <%Piemono> I did like all the Husk designs
[1:09:10] <%DrTomT18> Pat, remember to scan every planet and every system
[1:09:13] <%NitronStreams> They really wanted to new players to hop in to the last game in a trilogy of rpgs
[1:09:13] <%jillpilled> The only threat worse than the Reapers, BATARIANS
[1:09:17] <mr_saturday93> Being a batriaian must be shit rn. Some asshole human kills like 100,000+ of your race and then some squids come in and finish the job
[1:09:20] <%DrTomT18> every point counts
[1:09:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Am I the only one that kind of likes being racist against Batarians? Or do I need to have a talk w/ Joel again?
[1:09:25] <peachy996> Cannibals named as such because they'll eat dead bodies and get armor
[1:09:25] <choocheess> I like how even in being reaperified the batarians are monstrous cannibals
[1:09:26] <dawarw0lf> Read the cannibal codex pat when you get a chance
[1:09:31] <%GabeSweetMan> That's NOT the main fight lol
[1:09:35] <valriot> LUL
[1:09:36] <%GabeSweetMan> JOKER IS THE REAL HERO
[1:09:37] <$lotharrio> Pew-pew it, Pat
[1:09:37] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the stakes are WAY too high, now
[1:09:43] <falyden> we need mecha!!!
[1:09:44] <secret_npc> REAPER BATARIANS
[1:09:44] <VentWilsn> ok now u can check anderson's stats
[1:09:45] <+even_the_yuenglings> LuL
[1:09:45] <Laecerelius> FUCKING BATARIANS!
[1:09:45] <Profmcstevie> his THREAT is galaxy annihilating creatures
[1:09:45] <notsoy> they clearly need gundams
[1:09:45] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYEYEYE HE BACK
[1:09:47] <M0untain_wolf> Biggetst dickkest ships
[1:09:47] <tanarath> Pat, THAT IS THE POINT
[1:09:47] <Dunmarkh> LUL get fucked
[1:09:48] <+OG_M_Bison> Yea something more like Legends of the Galactic Heroes would be apt
[1:09:48] <+D00msDayDan> god imagine a mass effect naval combat game
[1:09:49] <iosephe> BATARIANS
[1:09:51] <peachy996> Hey codex guy is back
[1:09:51] <%AncelDeLambert> SHUT UP let me read!
[1:09:51] <%DrTomT18> Pat, thats the whole point of Mass Effect 3, GETTING ENOUGH SHIPS TO FIGHT THEM
[1:09:52] <$lotharrio> Thank god... we get to murder many Batarians.
[1:09:53] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:09:55] <%count_bob> That's the issue with Mass Effect.
[1:09:56] <%RealThiele> Triage effect
[1:09:56] <%GabeSweetMan> ewwwwww
[1:09:56] <%snow_bush> Should've invested in Gundams
[1:09:57] <secret_npc> THERE ARE A LOT OF REAPER BATARIANS
[1:09:59] <DatAsuna> I wonder where they got all those batarians hmm
[1:10:02] <+Goraka91> Fuck dem Batarians
[1:10:03] <%Deano8817> it'd be fucking rad if Mass Effect was a large scale space RTS
[1:10:05] <%NateyBeak> this is just what batarians always do tho
[1:10:07] <+rafaelba93> even as husks batarians are the worst
[1:10:09] <choocheess> look at the little mouth on their right shoulder
[1:10:11] <+akscully> eat them to gain their power
[1:10:14] <%jillpilled> Hmmm how'd all these Batarians become husks, really makes you think
[1:10:14] <%RetroCop87> iS THAT THE iLLUSIVE MAN NARRATING?
[1:10:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Indoctrination only made the batterians stronger
[1:10:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> that parts a lie, cannibals are basically mindless
[1:10:16] <valriot> DUDE, THEYRE SO FUCKING COOL
[1:10:17] <+gliph13> so as of today, Batarians are all but Extinct
[1:10:19] <%Dakuu75> it's no Disco VA
[1:10:19] <%Rumbutt> The Reapers actually made batarians smarter
[1:10:20] <%SABiscotti> BOY do you
[1:10:23] <AxelCezar> should have killed more batarians
[1:10:24] <%Aleate> You get a lot of that in this game
[1:10:25] <knight_verse> Read the Fall of Karshann in rhe secondary codex.
[1:10:25] <spicyramengaming> Marauders are sick.
[1:10:26] <%CollinsOfBodom> Batarians Everywhere System
[1:10:26] <%AncelDeLambert> dude, wait until you see the Asari ones
[1:10:26] <%watts121> basically humans are the weakest husks
[1:10:26] <peachy996> And they all look cool/ nightmarish
[1:10:27] <%Archmortal> Batarigeth
[1:10:28] <%James_Quivers> THEY SOMEHOW MADE BATARIANS EVEN WORSE
[1:10:29] <%LumberjackJack> Human husks are the lamest
[1:10:30] <%Ipsenscastle> there's some excellent codex entries in 'the reaper war' section
[1:10:33] <%RealThiele> martin sheen sound-alike
[1:10:34] <%JoshManVGH> JoshManVGH subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 7 Months of Pat branded content! Good luck saving the galax- HOLY HELL what are those!? Batarian mutated freak beasts!?
[1:10:35] <Javier9563> wait until asari husks
[1:10:37] <dawarw0lf> “Batarians are fucked”
[1:10:39] <TourettesPlays> Humans get turned into the worst monster DansGame DansGame
[1:10:40] <dekkitout> Are there hanar husks?
[1:10:42] <valriot> Beta Human Reapers
[1:10:44] <$lotharrio> If only we could have wiped out ALL of the Batarians...
[1:10:44] <+D00msDayDan> if only there weren't any batarians left to be turned into cannibals
[1:10:44] <%teefpal> Batarians are down to tens of thousands.
[1:10:45] <Mirrorcatch> i like that humans make the loser zombies and everything else is way cooler

[1:10:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> cannibals will sit around and eat their allies in the open and let you shoot them while they do it
[1:10:52] <%Wurmspawn> Cause they were the first husks.
[1:10:52] <mr_saturday93> Shepard did nothing wrong
[1:10:53] <%Ipsenscastle> humans suck
[1:10:53] <+AmericanSkidd> its like Halo Spartans, they can win individual battles, but not wars
[1:10:54] <+even_the_yuenglings> the asari ones are monkaS
[1:10:54] <%DrTomT18> swarm tactics

[1:11:35] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt The timer won't complete unless you stay with Anderson. Try to avoid doing normal vanguard things.
[1:11:35] <%Frodiddly> Can Reapers make husks of other creatures? Like birds and deer and roaches and shit?

[1:11:38] <%LumberjackJack> We playin' Doom now!

[1:13:32] <AxelCezar> space magic is the best
[1:13:33] <+TheBlack0ni565> hes beginning to believe...
[1:13:33] <%SABiscotti> Vanguard basically salvaged this game for me
[1:13:34] <TourettesPlays> Hey Pat remember when you argued with us about choosing Vanguard in ME1 LUL LUL
[1:13:34] <secret_npc> Feel it out, fair enough
[1:13:43] <%DrTomT18> Although I do miss the infinitely firing guns of Mass Effect 1
[1:13:46] <+even_the_yuenglings> into the drink
[1:13:48] <%Ipsenscastle> this is why we told you to play Vanguard
[1:13:49] <+tinytinykittycat> charge refills shields
[1:13:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, maybe keep in mind WHERE you're dashing to
[1:13:51] <Blank9> charge to get shields, nova to use them for DAMAGE, infinite mobility
[1:13:54] <%Wurmspawn> No
[1:13:54] <%andrewofbob> Nope
[1:13:54] <+even_the_yuenglings> no health regen
[1:13:55] <M0untain_wolf> nope
[1:13:55] <%DrTomT18> no, you have to heal
[1:13:56] <%Aleate> Nope
[1:13:56] <%Wallabri> nOPE
[1:13:56] <retrosadness> no
[1:13:56] <%AJ_Cherenkov> only up to pip
[1:13:57] <valriot> No medigel only
[1:13:57] <DSD24> No you need heals
[1:13:58] <SaltyAzteca> I dont think so
[1:13:58] <%AncelDeLambert> health? hell no
[1:13:58] <dd44dostivei> Use the weapon wheel like its VATS
[1:13:58] <Javier9563> you get back segments
[1:13:59] <%watts121> basically you need charge immediately after Nova
[1:13:59] <4DLuvOfLuthy> ME3 Vanguard is op lol
[1:14:00] <GuilKato> in vanilla this is infinite until gun empty
[1:14:00] <dawarw0lf> No medi gel
[1:14:00] <M0untain_wolf> medigel
[1:14:01] <secret_npc> Vanguard still sucks in ME1
[1:14:01] <+tinytinykittycat> nope
[1:14:01] <%Wurmspawn> That's what health packs are fo now.
[1:14:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> just the segment
[1:14:02] <%DrTomT18> Risk/Reward system, Pat
[1:14:02] <+gliph13> oh right, in this health dosnt regen
[1:14:02] <Laecerelius> Nope.  No regen
[1:14:03] <%SABiscotti> Segmented Recharge
[1:14:03] <%count_bob> NO.
[1:14:05] <%lloyddboy> health is pips now
[1:14:05] <spicyramengaming> Yeah, Vanguard can get fucked over if you aren't careful, especially early on.
[1:14:06] <%andrewofbob> Halo 1 style health
[1:14:07] <$lotharrio> Pips of health.
[1:14:07] <JudgeParadox> !uptime
[1:14:07] <@Moobot> @JudgeParadox I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 14m.
[1:14:08] <%ahomeschooldropout> this part keeps going until you run out of ammo
[1:14:10] <valriot> Its the old Halo health system
[1:14:10] <%LumberjackJack> Health regen is more limited now!
[1:14:11] <Mattais88> regrow that current pip, but thats it
[1:14:11] <Minorou> good shootbangs
[1:14:12] <%BlackStarAura> Nope
[1:14:14] <%RealThiele> medigel LIVES
[1:14:14] <+tinytinykittycat> level up anderson
[1:14:14] <M0untain_wolf> aka UNITY
[1:14:19] <%ahomeschooldropout> you can literally just shoot at the sky and finish this
[1:14:19] <DatAsuna> @even_the_yuenglings It's segmented regen, so you only get the current block of health back
[1:14:19] <blackjack8182> No
[1:14:21] <tanarath> @patstaresat up to that chunk, you have 5 health chunks
[1:14:22] <TourettesPlays> Pat are you starting to understand how gamebreaking Power Cooldown is yet????
[1:14:22] <buhbuhboat> Need medigel to heal health
[1:14:22] <%AzureGale> The health regeneration runs on Resistance rules
[1:14:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The guns in this game are amazing
[1:14:23] <%DrTomT18> there are so many guns in this game Pat, can't wait for you to try them all out
[1:14:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @secret_npc barrier is immortality in ME1
[1:14:26] <+condemned_15> SourPls
[1:14:27] <secret_npc> The sequence ends when your ammo runs out
[1:14:30] <%strakillias> health is the one gameplay thing they made worse
[1:14:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> this ends until you run out of ammo
[1:14:35] <+MrATheGreat> You get 3 pips of health per medigel iirc
[1:14:35] <%James_Quivers> Kaiden has a headache
[1:14:36] <%LumberjackJack> Shoot da gun
[1:14:36] <ThatGuyThere03> pretty sure you need to run out of ammo to trigger the next cutscene
[1:14:37] <tanarath> so 81% ->100%
[1:14:41] <%GabeSweetMan> eep
[1:14:41] <falyden> with the right upgrades, the avenger rifle can be the best assault rifle in the gane
[1:14:41] <+even_the_yuenglings> monkaS

[1:14:47] <falyden> game*
[1:14:48] <blackjack8182> Shoot at the sky
[1:14:50] <+ThomasOfTroy> iirc this sequence ends when you run out of ammo, so you can just mag dump to end it
[1:14:51] <%demiiluna> oh your last pip recovers
[1:14:53] <%AncelDeLambert> keep shootsing
[1:14:55] <%Ipsenscastle> Unity is your heal

[1:15:01] <choocheess> @DrTomT18 LUL
[1:15:01] <dawarw0lf> @strakillias I very much disagree. No more regen health is great
[1:15:03] <%strakillias> run out your ammo
[1:15:05] <+gliph13> i think you have to use up ALL your ammo
[1:15:06] <+tinytinykittycat> empty your ammo
[1:15:06] <%RealThiele> shoot more to trigger
[1:15:09] <+Thedoobiousone> waste ammo
[1:15:09] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt the squence only ends when you're out of ammo

[1:18:51] <humble_hill_dweller> Why didn't they blow up the Normandy, ship of the only nuisance they've faced in all this?
[1:18:52] <Maids4lyfe> rip vancouver
[1:18:53] <+traximus_s> like that one guy from my hero
[1:18:56] <%DrTomT18> Pat, those are the debris of Earths Feel, not more Reapers
[1:18:57] <tanarath> Yeah, naaaaah
[1:18:57] <%weissguard> Hey, here's a fun thought: Why didn't that Reaper aim at the Normandy?
[1:18:57] <Laecerelius> Now that's a 7 hour war
[1:18:57] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Alexa play "Reignite" by Malukah
[1:18:58] <falyden> nah it's just Canada
[1:18:58] <Psyramics> reapers walking around on the planet is so dumb, just glass it from orbit
[1:18:59] <%Treasure_Vault> Save and then load Earth
[1:18:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> This writing is so bad
[1:19:00] <%hrbeck_> hrbeck_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Why is time a nightmare? How did M. Night fuck up so badly to make it not seem as such?
[1:19:00] <$Mekhet09> They went in too fast.
[1:19:00] <SaltyAzteca> AAAAAND
[1:19:00] <%capnbeefs> Earth Fucked
[1:19:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> they aren't destroying it though
[1:19:01] <Zebroneath> Earth is fucking dead at this point
[1:19:02] <blue8moon> What's even the point of the reapers landing? Why not just shoot from space?
[1:19:02] <dawarw0lf> It takes months
[1:19:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Shit's fucked.
[1:19:02] <+akscully> just vancouver

[1:19:04] <dd44dostivei> the earth is getting GLASSED
[1:19:05] <Maids4lyfe> It's fine, it's just Canada

[1:19:06] <+even_the_yuenglings> dont worry about  it

[1:19:06] <SaltyAzteca> TITLE DROP
[1:19:10] <murdocismyhero> Is this climate change?
[1:19:11] <%JoshManVGH> We're going to "take back" Earth would have been more accurate
[1:19:12] <%lumporr> also they're like, shooting guns at it. we not gonna pull out the *bombs* at least?
[1:19:13] <%AzureGale> EARTH K.O.
[1:19:13] <secret_npc> OKAY, THE NORMIES HAVE LEFT, THE GAME CAN BE GOOD NOW
[1:19:15] <TourettesPlays> Didn't The Combine conquer earth in 8 hours? Combine > Reapers
[1:19:16] <dawarw0lf> Best title drop
[1:19:17] <M0untain_wolf> Earth is soo fucked afterwards

[1:19:18] <$Mekhet09> Bad writing is why this is happening.
[1:19:18] <+even_the_yuenglings> remember they want to harvest the people
[1:19:18] <%Rookie_Balboa> good opening
[1:19:19] <+RainFerret> Why can't the reaper ships just shoot the planet from space? Why even land?
[1:19:19] <%Jeemukun> it's just a little burnt! it's still good! it's still good!

[1:19:29] <ChungusQuest> STUMP CHUNKMEN
[1:19:30] <%DrTomT18> My math says that there are somewhere between 50,000 to 150,000 Reapers in the Galaxy.
[1:19:30] <Javier9563> also why does shepard want to bring every fleet back to save earth, it has already been established you can't beat the reapers conventionally, he doesn't know about the super weapon yet
[1:19:31] <SaltyAzteca> SOAP

[1:23:12] <%watts121> Alliance just stole what I assume was a privately owned vessel at this point since Shepard leaves Cerberus.

[1:24:08] <%IamGrapes> DONT
[1:24:09] <+Scevda> Just tweeted the item guide for you @patstaresat
[1:24:10] <blackjack8182> Grenades

[1:24:11] <%gliph13> TANK james, at least
[1:24:11] <%strakillias> You'll get good team mates soon and never use them again
[1:24:11] <karl_rex> Reave and overload is the way to go
[1:24:12] <%rockcentuar> you wont use them
[1:24:12] <%RealThiele> one guy
[1:24:13] <Laecerelius> WEapon damage for shoot man
[1:24:13] <tanarath> REAVE IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD
[1:24:16] <%Monkeyweed21> all damage
[1:24:17] <dawarw0lf> Passive and at least one of each
[1:24:18] <%rockcentuar> just auto
[1:24:20] <Brandon__Brando> are you really going to use humans?
[1:24:21] <secret_npc> James is a tank man, just make him healthy
[1:24:22] <peachy996> Undo Upgrade exists
[1:24:24] <Laecerelius> Weapon damage for shoots
[1:24:24] <+even_the_yuenglings> biotic combos are the name of the game
[1:24:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why is respec not a thing in every game??
[1:24:26] <%SABiscotti> Yeah
[1:24:26] <+rafaelba93> too many hoomans

[1:24:32] <GuilKato> you will almost never take them off the ship and you know it Pat
[1:24:33] <secret_npc> Health and armor
[1:24:33] <%teefpal> Tank
[1:24:34] <%DrTomT18> don't bother with his powers
[1:24:34] <Maids4lyfe> TANK HIM UP
[1:24:34] <%Jmann1892> big tank man
[1:24:35] <DatAsuna> sure tank him up
[1:24:35] <%watts121> I mean with James does it really matter?
[1:24:35] <+akscully> sure, you'll never use him again
[1:24:35] <Conscript_Gary> James is a Krogan
[1:24:35] <Oqzar> they rarely die
[1:24:36] <%DrTomT18> just make him a brick
[1:24:36] <%Shubreaker> TANKM
[1:24:36] <secret_npc> Tank tank
[1:24:38] <%demiiluna> Beef Thicksteak
[1:24:38] <dekkitout> Tank up the Man Slab
[1:24:40] <falyden> this music is great!
[1:24:41] <%watts121> He's gonna be in 3 missions tops
[1:24:41] <+tinytinykittycat> that and carnage
[1:24:42] <%gliph13> Big Boy, Big Tank
[1:24:42] <%LumberjackJack> Yup, first respec for each character is free. After first respec, it's like 500 credits, then 1000, etc
[1:24:43] <%ShawnTK_> James is your Krogan
[1:24:44] <%capnbeefs> BIg tank much gains
[1:24:46] <blackjack8182> Pat is never gonna use Kaiden again
[1:24:47] <+DracosMagala> James is the human Krogan
[1:24:47] <Lancaster_H> HARD MCHUGE
[1:24:48] <tattleworm> he's your krogan
[1:24:49] <%GabeSweetMan> I am genuinely glad you're doing this one since I never bothered playing it back in the day either (even though I bought it). Played the shit out of ME2+DLC and read up on basically everything.
[1:24:49] <secret_npc> Melee Tank
[1:24:51] <%aWanderingKaivo> try having Kaidain use Reave on a target, then Charge it yourself, you'll get a biotic combo detonation
[1:24:52] <dawarw0lf> Make sure you get all skills to 1 first
[1:24:52] <%IamGrapes> Beef up the dank tank
[1:24:52] <falyden> listen to those keystrokes
[1:24:53] <%AzureGale> Yeah, make James tank
[1:24:55] <ChungusQuest> TRUNK SLAMCHEST
[1:24:56] <+Kyma1020> BEEF
[1:24:57] <%Rumbutt> THICC
[1:24:57] <+tinytinykittycat> Carnage is good too
[1:24:58] <DatAsuna> Get lvl 1 of everything before you max
[1:24:59] <%SABiscotti> MAX BRICK
[1:24:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bricc
[1:25:01] <%gliph13> HUGE UP!
[1:25:03] <psidefx> oH NO
[1:25:04] <Laecerelius> Shit brick house
[1:25:04] <4DLuvOfLuthy> carnage is really good
[1:25:06] <valriot> CARNAGE GO UP
[1:25:06] <blackjack8182> Grenades for James
[1:25:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Thicc bricc
[1:25:10] <dawarw0lf> All skills to 1 pat!
[1:25:11] <%DrTomT18> god, Wrex was the best tank
[1:25:11] <%watts121> @ShawnTK_ jeez I just realized he is wasting the Krogan slot with his human bullshit
[1:25:12] <+TrevSmith222> I've always liked James.  He gets too much hate.
[1:25:12] <HyperionXV> Bro-gan
[1:25:12] <peachy996> Ugh yeah....he is your Krogan
[1:25:14] <+even_the_yuenglings> carnage fucks
[1:25:15] <%LumberjackJack> James < Grunt < Wrex
[1:25:16] <dekkitout> He's our little krogchamp
[1:25:16] <secret_npc> Fortification good
[1:25:19] <%Eilocke> BULK IRONHIDE
[1:25:21] <peachy996> Cuz you don't get a real one
[1:25:25] <%DrTomT18> fire ammo to squad
[1:25:27] <FassieFons> just think of james as the least interesting krogan squadmate (which is still good)
[1:25:28] <%gliph13> effectivly he is your Krogan
[1:25:28] <%somekindofsam> Krogan but boring
[1:25:33] <dawarw0lf> Then choose what to upgrade
[1:25:34] <%andrewofbob> Might want to get your ammo power to 1
[1:25:36] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Unlike the other ME games you DO get enough skill points to max out every stat
[1:25:39] <%RealThiele> Dirk Hardpec!
[1:25:39] <%LumberjackJack> Carnage is back! It rules in this game, too!
[1:25:40] <+TristonObv> all skills to 3
[1:25:40] <anAngryHamster> Señor Fist
[1:25:45] <Maids4lyfe> Krogan Latino
[1:25:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Chud Manly
[1:25:48] <%SABiscotti> 150% total
[1:25:48] <+MrATheGreat> Just because he’s latino doesn’t mean he’s a frog man Pat.
[1:25:49] <%DrTomT18> you fool
[1:25:54] <%BlackStarAura> Carnage is super good
[1:25:54] <knight_verse> Make fore ammo explosive
[1:25:56] <$homelesstwinky> Carnage busts armor
[1:25:56] <%gliph13> he's not boring, but not as cool.
[1:26:01] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Get one level of pull for Shepard. It can help defeat SHIELD-WIELDING ENEMIES.
[1:26:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can undo upgrade w Y
[1:26:02] <secret_npc> Honestly if you're on Normal, just do whatever
[1:26:05] <Maids4lyfe> yeah carnage fucks
[1:26:05] <peachy996> Kaiden will not matter right now imo
[1:26:07] <tattleworm> the explosive upgrade on incendiary ammo is busted on shotguns
[1:26:07] <dekkitout> @GabeSweetMan Chonk Manly
[1:26:07] <+AmericanSkidd> big brain
[1:26:08] <%Rumbutt> brute smarts
[1:26:09] <choocheess> @Maids4lyfe Krogina Latogan
[1:26:13] <+even_the_yuenglings> hes on hardcore
[1:26:15] <%SABiscotti> BIG WIZARD
[1:26:17] <DatAsuna> Kaidan is an armour shredder
[1:26:19] <Laecerelius> He's a sentinel
[1:26:22] <choocheess> Krogino
[1:26:23] <+even_the_yuenglings> el krogano
[1:26:30] <tattleworm> reave aoe, charge, nova
[1:26:31] <%andrewofbob> Always has been
[1:26:33] <atema128> I remembered James being boring but when I replayed recently I grew to like him.
[1:26:35] <DatAsuna> You want Kaidan to drop their defenses
[1:26:55] <%andrewofbob> Ammo to 1
[1:26:58] <tanarath> Vega is fun
[1:26:59] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Get one level of pull. It'll help against shield-wielding enemies.
[1:27:00] <%VioletHeart> Barrier is a toggle-able defense buff with no time limit now, if you wanted to use it again.
[1:27:01] <%GabeSweetMan> @GabeSweetMan Mm that one's better
[1:27:01] <Reverend_Godshyne> Kaidan fuckin rules in 3, gameplay-wise
[1:27:05] <%DrTomT18> Fitness and Shockwave are all you need, Pat
[1:27:06] <secret_npc> Fitness is a good tree for Vanguard
[1:27:11] <%SABiscotti> More Barrier = Bigger Nova
[1:27:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Sentinel is worst class
[1:27:13] <DatAsuna> You could stand to have a third skill so your LB isn't empty
[1:27:14] <+DracosMagala> This on hard???
[1:27:15] <%Ipsenscastle> I just don't like James because they write femshep to be thirsty at him by default. Also the 'Lola' thing is puke.
[1:27:19] <+MrATheGreat> Overload and reave is where it’s iirc
[1:27:29] <+even_the_yuenglings> overload is solid
[1:27:32] <%DrTomT18> you  can't pick your weapons yet
[1:27:32] <%andrewofbob> Hardcore difficulty
[1:27:32] <GustauveVIII> KATANA SUCKS
[1:27:34] <+Bigbossman91> @GarbageQueenEllie *best
[1:27:35] <%DrTomT18> next mission
[1:27:35] <spicyramengaming> James is okay, just wish they had added more squadmates in general.
[1:27:35] <%ahomeschooldropout> Engineer is the most underrated ME class
[1:27:36] <Laecerelius> Kay-tana
[1:27:37] <secret_npc> Time for ME3 to be good finally
[1:27:40] <dawarw0lf> Turn on barrier and fortification. They stay on forever
[1:27:40] <$homelesstwinky> Some ammo power effects will combo with charge
[1:27:40] <%lloyddboy> IT MAKES AN UNSHEATHE SOUND
[1:27:41] <+Soliloquy123> James has limited grenades? I forgot about that
[1:27:43] <peachy996> Femshep is so thirsty for Vega it legit makes Vega uncomfortable
[1:27:47] <%Lizard0TM> I love the sword sound the Katana makes
[1:27:47] <4DLuvOfLuthy> reave is the best
[1:27:52] <dekkitout> Sausage Fest- move out!
[1:27:53] <%LumberjackJack> Katana's meh, but you'll find much better, much crazier weapons soon
[1:27:57] <%SABiscotti> Kaidan's really useful
[1:27:59] <tanarath> Reave is G O O D
[1:27:59] <tattleworm> he teaches you it, so be nice to him @PatStaresAt
[1:28:02] <Reverend_Godshyne> Katana means Japanese shotgun
[1:28:02] <Profmcstevie> He's been studying the ways of the monk
[1:28:04] <+BlackIronVengarl> Do the easter egg quick!
[1:28:05] <+akscully> asari matriarchs and kaidan know reave
[1:28:05] <%Ipsenscastle> @peachy996 WITHOUT ANY PLAYER INPUT
[1:28:06] <%count_bob> Did you get the the guide.
[1:28:08] <%Wurmspawn> @PatStaresAt Sent you a link on twitter for upgrades. There are upgrades in this mission, btw.

[1:28:32] <peachy996> It's wild @Ipsenscastle
[1:28:42] <%AzureGale> Shepard can upgrade Twitter?
[1:28:43] <Profmcstevie> Deliver me the twitter updates Shepard
[1:28:44] <%watts121> @peachy996 I feel like Vega's seeming aesexuality is the reason why Bull was a huge himbo in DAI, to make it up to Freddie.
[1:28:47] <+Scevda> As did i…
[1:28:48] <%RealThiele> twitter upgrades to racism 2.1
[1:28:50] <Brandon__Brando> @ahomeschooldropout whats the one that mixes biodics with it engineer thats the best class
[1:28:53] <%LumberjackJack> Upgrade the Twitter to provide big gun and big qussy, ASAFP
[1:28:59] <AvroEltz> upgrade twitter by pressing the uninstall button
[1:28:59] <%CollinsOfBodom> Is nobody going to question what paige was doing with her face and glass?
[1:29:05] <%CollinsOfBodom> lol
[1:29:14] <peachy996> Vega isn't asexual though, he's just not into you, the player
[1:29:17] <Brandon__Brando> no
[1:29:21] <peachy996> He's happpy to hit on Ashley
[1:29:21] <+Scevda> @collinsofbodom were used to it
[1:29:22] <%RealThiele> seems like normal paige stuff
[1:29:28] <+Mrbaconator> eating it going by precedent
[1:29:34] <+AmericanSkidd> Consume the glass
[1:29:35] <+YabbaTroll> hey yall is this the first me3 stream, and has he actually started playing the game yet?
[1:29:43] <%CollinsOfBodom> You all make fine points

[1:30:07] <+YabbaTroll> Thank yall
[1:30:11] <Blank9> nice refreshing glass of spiders
[1:30:12] <%watts121> @peachy996 a NPC not into the player may as well just be sexless tho
[1:30:14] <peachy996> He's already done Part 1 of the tutorial and he's doing part 2 now
[1:30:18] <+YabbaTroll> ooh sexy robot lady inc
[1:30:33] <churropoppa> R E A L O A D

[1:30:50] <+YabbaTroll> its classy
[1:30:59] <%watts121> Oh you don't like the Sexdoll we buy for Joker?
[1:31:04] <%andrewofbob> Is chat spoiling the sexbot?
[1:31:07] <+AmericanSkidd> @YabbaTroll Illusive man absolutely had a synthetic vag installed
[1:31:21] <peachy996> I prefer EDi as the ship ai over the sexbot personally
[1:31:24] <+Scevda> If rather they had kept the relationship asymmetric.
[1:31:26] <%LumberjackJack> EDI's body is sexy, sure, but compared to FISTO? Nah
[1:31:31] <DatAsuna> He saw the sexbot
[1:31:36] <%Lizard0TM> y'all, stop spoilin
[1:31:37] <+Scevda> Same @peachy996
[1:31:37] <%watts121> @AmericanSkidd I mean it is meant to infiltrate...yo dick!
[1:31:38] <peachy996> But I can respect the idea to steal from Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda
[1:31:43] <terrible35> @LumberjackJack What a studly Bot.
[1:31:45] <+YabbaTroll> @AmericanSkidd I mean, it was built for infiltration right? gotta be able to pass xrays
[1:31:50] <peachy996> Since Andromeda is very Mass Effect 2 ish
[1:32:05] <%Lizard0TM> stop spoiling this... 9 year old game
[1:32:23] <%watts121> stop spoiling a game Pat already played but his boomer brain forgot?
[1:32:24] <+Scevda> By the hair actually being robot as well, it shouldnt have been able to pass at all.
[1:32:28] <%Lizard0TM> OH NO
[1:32:33] <%Lizard0TM> no signal
[1:32:34] <+AmericanSkidd> @Lizard0TM to be fair pat doesnt know most of it so we should behave
[1:32:39] <%AzureGale> Hello yello
[1:32:42] <%SABiscotti> You'll be fine, seriously
[1:32:42] <%Treuan> Fair
[1:32:43] <dekkitout> "GameFAQs guide" sounds like an oxymoron
[1:32:45] <28moogles> hell yeah wingin it
[1:32:50] <%LumberjackJack> Sounds good. If anything, "grind" for credits off-screen Kappa
[1:32:55] <+Saggitori> Robot fuckers league
[1:32:58] <Profmcstevie> Livin on the edge
[1:33:03] <%count_bob> As long as you have unlimited credits, sure.
[1:33:05] <DatAsuna> @peachy996 andromeda is very ME1ish
[1:33:06] <Dunmarkh> @watts121 he only played 90 minutes for a machinima episode
[1:33:06] <+Scevda> I sent you one as well @patstaresat
[1:33:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> gamefaqs for old games IS the best
[1:33:08] <valriot> Omikron guide LUL
[1:33:09] <$homelesstwinky> You'll be good as long as you scrape
[1:33:10] <Conscript_Gary> gamefaqs guides are the best
[1:33:14] <%watts121> Most Gamefaq guides are better then those damn books you find in Walmart.
[1:33:15] <dekkitout> "Used to" 💅🏿
[1:33:15] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Missed items in Omega will NOT appear at the shop.
[1:33:19] <+akscully> cyricZ's gamefaqs for yakuza are incredible
[1:33:20] <+toastybites> pre 2010s gamefaqs ruled
[1:33:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GAMEFAQS HAS CARRIED MY DUMB ASS FOR 15 YEARS
[1:33:24] <PanicSwytch> Gamefaqs guides are the best
[1:33:32] <%DrTomT18> you're on mars
[1:33:33] <%watts121> cuz Mars is red and eviil
[1:33:34] <%DrTomT18> idiot.
[1:33:34] <AluxStreams> the gamefaqs half of the two Omikron walkthroughs is okay.
[1:33:35] <+AmericanSkidd> because mars
[1:33:37] <anAngryHamster> Remember when gamefaqs was big enough to actually have good guides
[1:33:37] <%LumberjackJack> Thought Pat was gonna do the easter egg for a second
[1:33:40] <$lotharrio> Oh true, DLC items may not show up in stores.
[1:33:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> couldn't they have parked that ship somewhere that's not in massive storm range
[1:33:40] <peachy996> @DatAsuna parts of that too, but I'm thinking of the Magog, Beka Valentine, Tyr and Andromeda the character
[1:33:40] <%andrewofbob> I personally prefer a well written wiki, but a game needs a dedicated fanbase for that
[1:33:46] <Profmcstevie> Obscure PS2 game Gamefaq guides are peak internet
[1:33:47] <GustauveVIII> CHANGE LOADOUT
[1:33:47] <%Eilocke> cause it's Mars
[1:33:49] <%Monkeyweed21> the dust is renegade
[1:33:50] <GustauveVIII> oh well
[1:33:50] <%Lizard0TM> BOO THIS WEAPON
[1:33:51] <%aWanderingKaivo> cause some nerd on gamefaqs is going to be very eager to tell other nerds everything in full detail
[1:33:53] <peachy996> A lot of it reminds me of stuff in ME2
[1:33:54] <%DrTomT18> you do not need a sniper
[1:33:56] <%watts121> note the more weapons you equip the slower your powers
[1:33:57] <%andrewofbob> RuneScape's wiki is bonkers good
[1:34:01] <PanicSwytch> Gamefaqs helped me 100% ff7 and 8
[1:34:03] <DSD24> There are Markers here
[1:34:04] <%LumberjackJack> Tip: always hit "change loadout" when finding a new weapon
[1:34:08] <GuyverTypeL> Isn't here a easter egg?
[1:34:10] <+YabbaTroll> anyone else love big ass holes in the landscape? its cool every time
[1:34:11] <%Wurmspawn> *skeptical that Pat actually loaded up the link I sent, but w/e* It's the detailed mission by mission brakedown of where all the upgrades are fan written wiki.
[1:34:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> I know because I am that nerd
[1:34:15] <DSD24> There they are
[1:34:20] <sapphomet777> why does James
[1:34:20] <+YabbaTroll> like that dead space boss
[1:34:20] <psidefx> Feels like bungo stole the mars set up from here
[1:34:22] <%andrewofbob> Bad guys are bad again, yay
[1:34:31] <%Frodiddly> lol that sound delay
[1:34:31] <%LumberjackJack> CERBERUS DEAD
[1:34:32] <%SABiscotti> HELL YEAH
[1:34:34] <awfully_crispy> and then they're gonna execute ME
[1:34:36] <peachy996> Behold the second group of enemies you fight all game
[1:34:38] <+Scevda> @wurmspawn sent the same
[1:34:38] <Laecerelius> Cerberus dead!
[1:34:40] <+Goraka91> Cool outfits though
[1:34:40] <%Ipsenscastle> I FUCKING LOVE THIS TRACK
[1:34:42] <+AmericanSkidd> Cerberus bad!?! I cant believe it
[1:34:44] <Kivros> Cerberus was always bad
[1:34:45] <SaltyAzteca> Throw down OUR weapons? HA
[1:34:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> RRRAAGH
[1:34:46] <Minorou> did you just AoE in the middle of a bunch of civilians
[1:34:46] <choocheess> cerberus picked a great time to kill humans
[1:34:48] <TourettesPlays> Welcome to one of three exciting enemy types you fight in this game
[1:34:56] <%rockcentuar> did he get the sniper
[1:35:00] <%rockcentuar> or did i miss it
[1:35:00] <$KnivesEve> so what i miss? is pat still with tali?
[1:35:00] <%Lizard0TM> Fuck Kaidan
[1:35:01] <%Frodiddly> Love that they have angry eye slots on their helmets
[1:35:02] <CrimsonFox777> "Throw down your weapons, we won't hurt you." - guy immediately after executing a prisoner.
[1:35:05] <%hewlettfan96> cheer500 Hey Pat! just wanted to state THE Unpopular opinion i actually like the ME3 Ending, also I wish Paige the happiest of Birthdays!! hope you take care of her as. her husbando! also Paige has to make her own Cake how sad!! psaWrong
[1:35:05] <Gelphaze> Indoctrination is very simpler to the Marker from Deadspace, which came first?
[1:35:08] <%Ipsenscastle> oh man you don't get nearly enough of that piece of music, it's so fucking good
[1:35:10] <awfully_crispy> who the fuck is kaiden
[1:35:11] <%Lizard0TM> he's such a piece of shit
[1:35:12] <Profmcstevie> Kaiden I'll slap you with my shep dick
[1:35:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> types? its a whole group, with a bunch of different types.. more varied than all the mercs in 2
[1:35:23] <+TrevSmith222> Believable from his perspective.
[1:35:23] <%watts121> I love replaying this part with the Cerberus Nightmare Armor and Shepard looks so fucking guilty.
[1:35:31] <GuyverTypeL> with my bionic shep dick
[1:35:33] <%andrewofbob> We're the new, sexier security
[1:35:33] <TourettesPlays> @Ipsenscastle ME3 OST is weak as hell man it sucks
[1:35:34] <%Lizard0TM> yeah it does
[1:35:36] <+MrATheGreat> It’s almost as if you have to fight an enemy here or something
[1:35:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> this is just the first level, so we don't see all the troops types Cerb has yet
[1:35:41] <Profmcstevie> Can't target this
[1:35:48] <DSD24> No more "Can't reach the target"
[1:35:48] <anAngryHamster> Shepherd was never Cerberus, he just took advantage of their hospitality
[1:35:49] <%CollinsOfBodom> thanks space carth
[1:35:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Gelphaze ME1 release like 6 months earlier I think
[1:35:58] <+Qexec> As god intended
[1:36:01] <peachy996> ME3 OST is not appealing for me. Even the club tracks don't hit the same way
[1:36:02] <%Bt_Robot> Speedrunners turn ME3 into a platformer
[1:36:02] <%Ipsenscastle> @TourettesPlays in general yes, but Mars is the best track in the series and I'll stand by that
[1:36:07] <%AJ_Cherenkov> weapon proficiencies are gone, equip any type you want!
[1:36:15] <$lotharrio> "I told them to show up here, Kaidan."
[1:36:15] <GuyverTypeL> NO MAN, CHILL
[1:36:18] <peachy996> Straight answers to Bisexual Questions
[1:36:20] <%watts121> @TourettesPlays I mean nothing is gonna beat M4 Part 2 so it was always gonna be downhill.
[1:36:29] <+Egg0fTheKing> they didn't attack Earth first, they attacked and destroyed the Batarians first, that's why there are BATARIAN reaper enemies
[1:36:31] <%Ipsenscastle> you don't really hear it in-game though unfortunately, it's really badly implemented
[1:36:38] <dawarw0lf> That’s a lie!
[1:36:39] <%LumberjackJack> And TIM fucking hated me after I blew that shit up
[1:36:41] <+Dova573> I told them to Fuck off Kaiden
[1:36:41] <+AmericanSkidd> Kaiden always sounded less like an asshole as opposed to Ashley
[1:36:43] <+Scevda> @peachy996 its good symphonic music but ya its definitely not the same feel to it
[1:36:43] <TourettesPlays> @Ipsenscastle oh yea Mars sets this game off to a really strong start its a great level
[1:36:46] <%DrTomT18> hes a big boy
[1:36:47] <%cvp5127> himbo armor
[1:36:49] <%GabeSweetMan> He crushed their Cerbussy.
[1:36:50] <valriot> Blue Doomguy
[1:36:51] <%SABiscotti> Sentinels are magical tanks
[1:36:52] <+Soliloquy123> God, the armor designs in this game are AMAZING
[1:36:53] <HyperionXV> raysBeef
[1:36:54] <%Lizard0TM> I hate Kaidan so much
[1:36:55] <peachy996> There's beefier armor out there
[1:36:56] <GuilKato> Kaidan needs a straight answer about this, but he wants a gay/bi/pan answer later on
[1:37:00] <DSD24> Angry Shepard
[1:37:02] <choocheess> I know that you feel this Shepherd
[1:37:05] <Psyramics> special beefcake sized armor
[1:37:06] <+akscully> smooch kaidan and you'll see how beefy he is
[1:37:09] <vraskuu> that eyebrows are angry
[1:37:11] <SaltyAzteca> yeaaah get used to things meaning one thing and Shep saying the other
[1:37:11] <%pilgrimsayswhat> >:C
[1:37:11] <peachy996> It was preoder armor but I forget the name. But MAN is it beefy looking
[1:37:11] <%LumberjackJack> Uh oh, it's my ex
[1:37:12] <%demiiluna> "I'm sorry Shepard. It's just that I'm a Carth, and Carths have trust issues."
[1:37:14] <valriot> BLUSSY
[1:37:16] <TheAntiNihilist> BETRAY HIM NOW
[1:37:16] <+Scevda> @guilkato lol
[1:37:17] <GuyverTypeL> Shepard is just tired man
[1:37:18] <%andrewofbob> Batarian homeworld was a big unknown, so Reapers cheesed them then spread out
[1:37:22] <peachy996> comically beefy
[1:37:23] <stantheman_97> BLUSSY
[1:37:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Sup girl
[1:37:25] <%Frodiddly> SHADOW BROKER
[1:37:25] <$lotharrio> Look at that vent rat.
[1:37:28] <%andrewofbob> Oh, no, girl in trouble?
[1:37:28] <+AmericanSkidd> how the fuck did this end up like this?
[1:37:28] <%CollinsOfBodom> Shepard: "Bro just trust me bro please bro"
[1:37:29] <DSD24> Look at these Cerberus assholes
[1:37:29] <SaltyAzteca> She got WEAK
[1:37:32] <Laecerelius> GIVE ME THAT MATTOCK!
[1:37:33] <Profmcstevie> HEY THATS MY EX BLUSSY
[1:37:34] <%watts121> That's how Liara gets her info
[1:37:34] <Dunmarkh> LIARA FOUGHT A SPECTRE
[1:37:34] <+YabbaTroll> anyone else see that one gif of this sequence with certain mods?
[1:37:36] <%cvp5127> old blussy
[1:37:38] <%Shubreaker> ayy they got mattocks
[1:37:39] <$lotharrio> Liara is bad at being a Shadow Broker.
[1:37:40] <FleshFriend> lol this bumble chase
[1:37:42] <+MrATheGreat> Yo she a gremlin now!
[1:37:43] <SaltyAzteca> THERE WE GO
[1:37:44] <%DrTomT18> Liara is probably really fucking mad at you
[1:37:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> I love how this kind of turns stealthy vent usage on its head its so fucking loud lol
[1:37:44] <choocheess> Shepherd looked like Will Poulter for a sec on that elevator
[1:37:46] <peachy996> Don't send your agents or anything Broker
[1:37:48] <Dunmarkh> that's more like it
[1:37:48] <%lemuhollow> lemuhollow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months!

[1:38:15] <%nobodybutalex> it's lightning!
[1:38:16] <DSD24> Look at that face
[1:38:16] <%AzureGale> Liara sure got more confident
[1:38:17] <choocheess> Dude biotic canon gets stronger every game
[1:38:18] <+kortin> That was really awkward lol
[1:38:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Eyes straight to the boobs
[1:38:19] <+AmericanSkidd> wtf is that face shepard
[1:38:20] <%DrTomT18> "Hey, I may or may not fucked Tali."
[1:38:21] <peachy996> That stare Right to her boobs
[1:38:21] <$lotharrio> The game wants you to be in love with her, so bad.
[1:38:22] <PanicSwytch> Be gone thot
[1:38:22] <AxelCezar> bad blussy
[1:38:23] <%DrTomT18> "Just a heads up."
[1:38:24] <hippofant> Did Pat just look at her boobs?
[1:38:25] <+spaceroyalty> is shepard just staring at her tiddies?
[1:38:26] <%snugglepuggs> By the goddess
[1:38:27] <%Eilocke> oh god
[1:38:27] <+toastybites> I forgot about this
[1:38:27] <Minorou> she's become much more morally gray
[1:38:28] <%strakillias> Remember, when caught in a singularity, stop shooting at the person who put you there.
[1:38:28] <%capnbeefs> Fuck off Kaiden!!!
[1:38:31] <AluxStreams> This is the most cardboard scene in the game.
[1:38:32] <%SABiscotti> There's a reason she's crawling around on mars lol
[1:38:35] <%Bt_Robot> Wow, was he leering at he tits?
[1:38:36] <%MugenSandan> Is it just me or are her boobs bigger
[1:38:38] <$Teh_Un> The opening to the conversation feels so weird
[1:38:38] <%watts121> @peachy996 I mean they look amazing in this game.
[1:38:41] <%LumberjackJack> Time to explain the Deus Ex of the entire gaaaaaaaaame
[1:38:44] <+MrATheGreat> “You too liara,” Shepard says as he eyes up her tits.
[1:38:44] <%ssjklyco> Did her breast get bigger?
[1:38:45] <%JoshManVGH> "Kaiden why are YOU here!?"
[1:38:48] <Javier9563> so convenient
[1:38:51] <+AmericanSkidd> better than nothing
[1:38:53] <DSD24> @MugenSandan Biotic Buff
[1:38:57] <+Scevda> Her tits be huge now
[1:38:57] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @ssjklyco probably
[1:38:59] <%LumberjackJack> Such bullshit, ugh
[1:38:59] <choocheess> @ssjklyco YES
[1:39:00] <%DrTomT18> @MugenSandan Everyone gets bigger boobs with each installment
[1:39:00] <dawarw0lf> Reaper doomsday device “oh shit”
[1:39:00] <atema128> Yeah they made her boobs bigger.
[1:39:03] <%andrewofbob> Humans are noobs
[1:39:04] <+Birdigalore> Cuz they found the script
[1:39:07] <+RoByte2> We didn't need this McGuffin until now, duh
[1:39:08] <Brandon__Brando> LUL
[1:39:09] <%watts121> THE PLOT NEEDED US TO FIND IT
[1:39:13] <%CollinsOfBodom> we just didn't look at the "reapers" section
[1:39:14] <TourettesPlays> that's a hype fucking rhyme Liara just made
[1:39:15] <%AzureGale> Hand wave'd
[1:39:16] <+critikal_bit> That explains NOTHING
[1:39:19] <BigFingerRo> WHERE'S TALI?
[1:39:20] <peachy996> WAIIT
[1:39:20] <tanarath> BIG MCGUFFIN
[1:39:23] <%pilgrimsayswhat> THAT WAS SUCH A NON ANSWER
[1:39:25] <+AmericanSkidd> wtf did they tell him
[1:39:27] <%Ipsenscastle> why does Hackett know you're the Shadow Broker????
[1:39:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Why come YOURSELF THO?
[1:39:32] <+even_the_yuenglings> LuL
[1:39:34] <peachy996> Hackett KNOWS you're the Shadow Broker
[1:39:37] <$Teh_Un> Shot down
[1:39:38] <ThatGuyThere03> CURVED
[1:39:38] <%capnbeefs> Tsoni is the best.
[1:39:39] <%andrewofbob> You're just going to say that in front of the 2 alliance loyalists?
[1:39:40] <Profmcstevie> .....that answered nothing
[1:39:43] <+Mrbaconator> FRIEND ZONED
[1:39:46] <FassieFons> bluessy denied
[1:39:47] <%sonuke_draws> Tali for life
[1:39:49] <%radda343> avoid first wife, go all in on second wife
[1:39:49] <%watts121> Cuz Liara is horrible at hiding that she's the shadow broker
[1:39:52] <Reverend_Godshyne> “We fucked up the trilogy’s narrative so it’s this now”
[1:39:52] <BigFingerRo> SWERVE ON A QUARIAN
[1:39:55] <+Birdigalore> "Shepard, I found the script!"
[1:39:56] <%JoshManVGH> "We need shepard to find something that in a place that doesn't require a Mass Relay..."
[1:39:57] <%LumberjackJack> Could be... a plot device, if you would.
[1:40:03] <$Faustgesicht> TBF that little drone was doing most of the shadow broker's work
[1:40:03] <%DrTomT18> yeah why doesn't she have a fucking battalion of armed guards
[1:40:04] <wibbwobbler> I like Vega a lot more now that I know who his actor is for some reason lmao
[1:40:06] <AxelCezar> NO HUMAN DICK FOR YOU
[1:40:11] <%LumberjackJack> Liara, what's over there, IS THAT THE SCRIPT?!
[1:40:14] <%marusux> Man all I can hear is fucking Lightning talking now. Fuck FF13 that trilogy is garbage.
[1:40:28] <%DrTomT18> Liara is OBSESSED with Shepard and it's kinda creepy
[1:40:30] <+AmericanSkidd> The Device is called: The Maguffin
[1:40:31] <$lotharrio> Man, too bad we didn't spend like three games just building up an army and connections to fight the Reapers, geared up by killing one or two of them and jury rigging their tech onto our fleets...
[1:40:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @wibbwobbler He voices Iron Bull in Dragon Age Inquisition too
[1:40:37] <Profmcstevie> A plan that never got off the ground is still a plan
[1:40:39] <peachy996> It's not like Liara has Shadow Broker agents at her disposal or anything
[1:40:40] <+Goraka91> It's pretty obvious that Liara is the writer's favourite
[1:40:44] <choocheess> it's not a walk and talk because that's too hard to animate
[1:40:48] <SaltyAzteca> WE HAVE BLUSSY, WE DONT NEED YOU
[1:40:55] <ChungusQuest> get outta here, Thunk Blastblob
[1:40:56] <scrumbotime> Did pat just call her Old Blussy
[1:41:00] <%scaryboisupreme> SHEPARD SHEPARD THAT'S TOO VALUABLE AN ASS TO LOSE
[1:41:00] <%LumberjackJack> Sorry, James, BioWare say 2 companions max for this franchise, not 3
[1:41:05] <peachy996> Liara is the creator's pet and it shows the most in this game
[1:41:05] <+MrATheGreat> JAMES GOT BENCHED
[1:41:05] <$dalmek> like that old timey show, I Love Blussy?
[1:41:07] <%SABiscotti> LEVEL HER
[1:41:09] <%CollinsOfBodom> wouldn't you want the tank over the biotic that doesn't fucking trust you
[1:41:11] <DSD24> Biotic Combos!
[1:41:13] <%AzureGale> BUSSY
[1:41:17] <choocheess> jeez way to brag
[1:41:19] <+even_the_yuenglings> DO COMBO
[1:41:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> Try reave after they are caught in singularity
[1:41:29] <thesejeanns> patty boiiiii8iiiiii
[1:41:30] <%aWanderingKaivo> or charge
[1:41:32] <peachy996> They wanted a short ME1 reunion
[1:41:34] <choocheess> body body body body body
[1:41:34] <DSD24> Now Pass It!
[1:41:42] <peachy996> So that's why Kaiden stuck
[1:41:48] <%aWanderingKaivo> also Liara's instant singularity is so OP
[1:41:50] <%LumberjackJack> "PURE"
[1:41:54] <%watts121> "Pure" get it?
[1:41:55] <DSD24> Liara is more Blue now
[1:41:57] <%DrTomT18> shes a mage
[1:42:00] <%watts121> PUREBLOODED BITCH!

They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! 31 months, 3 years soon psaDab psaDab I just played through ME2 and 3 recently, just a bit before the Legendary announcement, and while 2 looks a lot better, 3 still looks almost the exact same to me
[1:42:01] <%DrTomT18> power upgrades
[1:42:06] <peachy996> But....benching the VS would have worked better in sowing distrust from them
[1:42:07] <%CollinsOfBodom> dirty, filthy biotic
[1:42:08] <+MrATheGreat> Hey Pat use the Kinect to command your party members!
[1:42:08] <$lotharrio> Pure cause of the racism.

[1:42:15] <%Lizard0TM> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:42:15] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[1:42:16] <Dunmarkh> POWER
[1:42:16] <Brandon__Brando> that aiming reticle for the shotgun is hilarious
[1:42:16] <+Goraka91> Not even pure though
[1:42:18] <%AJ_Cherenkov> okay, but whole squad bonus
[1:42:19] <DatAsuna> digustic pureblood
[1:42:21] <Profmcstevie> WIZARD
[1:42:21] <%SABiscotti> Yeah
[1:42:22] <+akscully> yeah
[1:42:22] <%LumberjackJack> Power, yup. Recharge speed for Liara is always really good
[1:42:24] <rytisone> need more power
[1:42:25] <%strakillias> Pargon, Pargon, Pargon
[1:42:26] <Laecerelius> Liara lieks it raw
[1:42:28] <Oqzar> singularity isnt that good
[1:42:32] <%DrTomT18> get Warp
[1:42:32] <+MrATheGreat> Singularity is super good
[1:42:32] <tanarath> Pat, you can choose from either line, btw
[1:42:32] <Storm_Samurai> Looks like he found a way to fix face?
[1:42:36] <%GabeSweetMan> @LumberjackJack Then where's my polyamorous option with Garrus AND Tali so I can have my Cloaca-Qussy fuck pile?
[1:42:37] <+Scevda> Squad upgrade
[1:42:37] <%DrTomT18> Warp Good
[1:42:39] <choocheess> @strakillias LUL
[1:42:41] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I presume everyone made it through ME2, yes
[1:42:43] <%AzureGale> UNLIMITED PO-WER
[1:42:45] <%watts121> Singularity is great for Biotic Explosions
[1:42:45] <%aWanderingKaivo> singularity is GREAT what are you talking about lol
[1:42:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> @TourettesPlays ...No
[1:42:45] <peachy996> You'll want Warp
[1:42:46] <%Ipsenscastle> @strakillias lol that still gets me
[1:42:50] <+AmericanSkidd> Our favorite incest baby
[1:42:51] <peachy996> In the future
[1:42:52] <GuilKato> raw power yeah
[1:42:55] <%SABiscotti> Charge will detonate people caught in a Singularity
[1:42:58] <BigFingerRo> WARP IS FUCKIN SICK GODDAMN
[1:42:59] <%Lizard0TM> Didn't even level the singularity
[1:43:00] <%Lizard0TM> smh
[1:43:03] <%aWanderingKaivo> probably the best biotic power for squadmates period
[1:43:05] <tanarath> Warp is HUGE now
[1:43:05] <%andrewofbob> @PatStaresAt Use warp on someone lifted by singularity
[1:43:09] <TourettesPlays> @TourettesPlays yea you're right most people kissed Garrus
[1:43:12] <dawarw0lf> Put barrier on Kaiden
[1:43:14] <valriot> LUL WHAT WAS THAT
[1:43:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Warp can also detonate
[1:43:15] <%aWanderingKaivo> or reave
[1:43:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and prime
[1:43:18] <+even_the_yuenglings> its so cool
[1:43:20] <DSD24> Movement feels so good in this game
[1:43:22] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt There are power combos in the game. You can cause an explosion if you Charge into a guy who's affected by Reave.
[1:43:24] <%LumberjackJack> Or reave someone just before charging into them
[1:43:25] <%rockcentuar> charge singularity targets for the big boom
[1:43:26] <+D00msDayDan> yeah they had to make it smoother because you can't pause to use the wheel in MP
[1:43:26] <dawarw0lf> Barrier is permanent
[1:43:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> reave can detonate too
[1:43:30] <peachy996> When do those awful screaming bitches show up anyway
[1:43:32] <DatAsuna> Think of it like the Genshin Elemental Reaction system
[1:43:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> @TourettesPlays Correct, at least I did
[1:43:41] <$Teh_Un> Chaos
[1:43:42] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt When you get the chance, try hitting an enemy with warp, then Kaiden's reave
[1:43:45] <DatAsuna> you want to prime and detonate powers for reactions
[1:43:45] <+even_the_yuenglings> absolutely
[1:43:45] <dekkitout> CHAOS?!
[1:43:46] <Storm_Samurai> Hmm
[1:43:49] <%LumberjackJack> HMMMMMMMMMM
[1:43:52] <+Goraka91> We needed human villains to shoot
[1:43:53] <hippofant> Press F to doubt.
[1:43:55] <+AmericanSkidd> Yeah thats CRAZY
[1:44:02] <%capnbeefs> Cause they are such
[1:44:06] <+condemned_15> UNLIMITED POWERRRRRRR
[1:44:06] <%SABiscotti> Yoomanity
[1:44:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> hugh manatee
[1:44:08] <tattleworm> if you see someone under a biotic effect, charge that shit
[1:44:10] <+D00msDayDan> hugh mannity
[1:44:10] <%ahomeschooldropout> The Cerberus 180 bugs me so much
[1:44:10] <peachy996> You Manity
[1:44:11] <homestylewaffles> HUGE MANATEE
[1:44:11] <%LumberjackJack> All about Huge-Man-Titties
[1:44:12] <Mechazoic_Era> hugh manatee
[1:44:12] <hat_under_bread> Yeah. They'd have to be mind controlled or something to act that dumb.
[1:44:15] <%watts121> "HYUKmanity?"
[1:44:15] <%somekindofsam> Because the Illusive Man is a jerkass
[1:44:16] <%QueequegTheater> I love how Vega is LITERALLY a Call of Duty man isekai'ed into ME
[1:44:17] <choocheess> they're working for the humans so hard that they reached all the way around to where they're actually working for the reapers
[1:44:17] <RoldanDgr8> Umanity
[1:44:18] <+AmericanSkidd> UMadity
[1:44:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Man, I got an itch for ME3's multiplayer
[1:44:21] <+Scevda> Because the new plot demands
[1:44:24] <+condemned_15> LUL
[1:44:26] <+even_the_yuenglings> PogChamp
[1:44:26] <dawarw0lf> Same reason saren and his Geth are the bad guys in 1
[1:44:29] <peachy996> I forgot about those!
[1:44:32] <%AgniBrandt> I COMPLETELY forgot those existed
[1:44:37] <%AzureGale> Hugh Manity
[1:44:41] <+AmericanSkidd> crush their damned skulls
[1:44:45] <choocheess> jeez cerberus is full of beef cakes
[1:44:46] <KaitlynnHere> Hue-manity
[1:44:47] <peachy996> You can do that MP too
[1:44:49] <mr_saturday93> Pat words
[1:44:51] <$lotharrio> Peach kabloey.
[1:44:52] <+MrATheGreat> Illusive man has to betray someone every month to retain his youthful looks.
[1:44:53] <%James_Quivers> those are huge in the MP
[1:44:58] <+Goraka91> Pretty sure Cerberus even before 3 killed more humans than the First Contact War
[1:44:59] <SaltyAzteca> There are a lot of things I forget in 3
[1:44:59] <%Wallabri> A Kflutey?
[1:44:59] <%AgniBrandt> The stealth kills didn't return for Andromeda did they?
[1:44:59] <+condemned_15> nailed it
[1:45:01] <VentWilsn> a "foodian"?
[1:45:04] <%Ipsenscastle> they love saying pedway
[1:45:04] <williamrooster> Humanity for me but not for thee
[1:45:07] <BTR_NOODLE> the room with the pinky?
[1:45:07] <%ForlornCarton> Doom3 Shotgun!
[1:45:09] <%Eilocke> just say it in french
[1:45:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> droom
[1:45:11] <KaitlynnHere> Slap her butt as a reward
[1:45:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Humanity's history summarized: "U mad @ me?"
[1:45:17] <%LumberjackJack> Shuriken SUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS in this game
[1:45:22] <GustauveVIII> Power Recharge 200% gogogog
[1:45:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> Oh god, I forgot about this equip system
[1:45:24] <$lotharrio> Power Recharge Speed at 200%
[1:45:26] <+condemned_15> you got the collectables list?
[1:45:30] <%Ipsenscastle> oh here we go
[1:45:31] <%watts121> There are ALOT of guns in this game
[1:45:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> shurikan is sub machine
[1:45:37] <%watts121> Especially with DLC
[1:45:37] <Aiutare47> you can just run shotgun assault rifle and be good tbh
[1:45:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> 125-200 is fine tbh
[1:45:42] <peachy996> You can play missions with one gun if your setup is good enough
[1:45:43] <%andrewofbob> If you're an idiot, you can equip 5 weapons
[1:45:44] <+MrATheGreat> Smh
[1:45:47] <%LumberjackJack> A lot of strong, great guns in this game, Shuriken is not one of them
[1:45:51] <choocheess> hopefully you can get that SMG from the Kasumi mission
[1:45:57] <GustauveVIII> 195% good enough
[1:45:57] <peachy996> And the weight capacity makes your cooldown shorter
[1:45:59] <%lloyddboy> NO GUNS PAT
[1:46:02] <%Theycallmenerf> Get Garrus to become God
[1:46:02] <+Scevda> I aim for above 150%
[1:46:06] <+AmericanSkidd> More weapons or more cooldown
[1:46:07] <%AJ_Cherenkov> THIS MADMAN
[1:46:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> Jesus Christ, I'm getting flashbacks of the devs talking about how wonderful the mod system was going to be
[1:46:08] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt No weapon Vanguard is a legit build
[1:46:08] <peachy996> So Vanguard can get even nuttier
[1:46:10] <%aWanderingKaivo> locust is not really as good in 3 as it was in 2 though
[1:46:11] <%SABiscotti> you took off your shotgun lol
[1:46:13] <%andrewofbob> 5 weapons is ok for soldier, since they only get 1 power
[1:46:18] <%QueequegTheater> ZERO
[1:46:19] <%Aleate> Yep
[1:46:21] <TourettesPlays> THAT SMG SOUNDS SO COOL SHOOT IT AGAIN
[1:46:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> most smgs suck, except the hurricane
[1:46:22] <Profmcstevie> You can be a magic man with no guns if you're feeling wild
[1:46:22] <peachy996> ye
[1:46:23] <williamrooster> You can carry any weapon
[1:46:25] <%Aleate> Light shotcun or pistol
[1:46:25] <Minorou> less weapons = more powers
[1:46:27] <peachy996> Yeah man
[1:46:27] <tanarath> ZERO
[1:46:28] <$Futurecity10> yeah, vanguard is so powerful I unequiped all my weapons
[1:46:28] <%QueequegTheater> ZOOM ZOOM
[1:46:29] <%Eilocke> equip only the lightest of guns so you can transcend into biotic godhood
[1:46:30] <%Ipsenscastle> punchmagic
[1:46:30] <Aiutare47> youre stuck with that until you find a bench
[1:46:31] <%snugglepuggs> There’s a mod that gets rid of weight
[1:46:31] <Mattais88> Charge Nova charge nova
[1:46:32] <%aWanderingKaivo> you CAN'T use no weapon..
[1:46:32] <+D00msDayDan> there's a pistol that weighs almost nothing and you can carry just that
[1:46:33] <Laecerelius> weapons are for weaklings and cowards
[1:46:33] <Dunmarkh> PURE MELEE BIOTIC
[1:46:33] <Profmcstevie> No weapon, hyper power regen speed, ZOOM ABOUT
[1:46:33] <Javier9563> the lightest pistol you find
[1:46:34] <%watts121> @SABiscotti shotgun is worthless to ME3 Vanguard until you can make it weightless
[1:46:34] <%LumberjackJack> More like "take the lightest pistol and that's it" Vanguard
[1:46:41] <peachy996> You have to carry one but you don't have to use it for Vanguard
[1:46:42] <+MrATheGreat> Isn’t that a nice little compromise to what it used to be?
[1:46:43] <Conscript_Gary> as an Adept I like to just bring a pistol and an Avenger and never use either
[1:46:48] <%HeadAsianInCharge> charge nova is so OP.
[1:46:52] <+chimaera24> More weapons = longer power cooldowns
[1:46:52] <%Rumbutt> Vanguard doesn't need guns that shoot bullets, vanguards ARE bullets
[1:46:53] <%Treuan> Hmm
[1:46:53] <terrible35> tieSonci Gotta Vanguard fast
[1:46:54] <$lotharrio> Weapons are for mortals. You've got punch magic.
[1:46:55] <%LumberjackJack> Not suspicious at all, Liara?
[1:46:57] <%ahomeschooldropout> who is that woman and why is she DUMMY THICC
[1:46:57] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt There are no-weapon Insanity difficulty playthroughs
[1:46:59] <+condemned_15> monkaS
[1:47:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hmmm
[1:47:02] <%SABiscotti> @watts121 fair, it's your ranged weapon only
[1:47:03] <Grimmaru> 8:46 reppin
[1:47:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> CAREFUL, Shepard! that ass is fatter than it looks!

[1:47:10] <%watts121> Pat your EST is showing.
[1:47:11] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> son of a goat man ,hes already playing
[1:47:15] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> oh man, me and Pat are in the same time zone, we should make plans
[1:47:17] <+Fooguwu> why does that new doc have such a fat ass
[1:47:18] <+ComfortableStranger> @Sphincter_Spelunker blood pacck punisher is great for armor, also the hornet can wreck when modded right
[1:47:19] <KeystoneA2> @GarbageQueenEllie Damn that thing's big!
[1:47:19] <+AmericanSkidd> hm
[1:47:26] <secret_npc> I don't care, the overall dialogue in this game is the best in the series
[1:47:28] <%Theycallmenerf> Hey look it’s EDI
[1:47:28] <%ACRAZEDMONKEY> quick chase down that sex bot!
[1:47:29] <peachy996> Between Edi and Ashley, they clearly wanted Miranda back
[1:47:31] <Grimmaru> Vanguard is the superior choice for real gamers
[1:47:38] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> LAOD yo gameh
[1:47:43] <secret_npc> Better than ME2 anyway
[1:47:45] <+Buzzkill983> Illusive Man likes girls with a Heavy rear
[1:47:45] <%Ipsenscastle> already missing datapads, this man's goblins are going to riot
[1:47:47] <%Theycallmenerf> Chase down the sentient blowup doll
[1:47:47] <%rockcentuar> I used a sniper solo for my vangaurd playthrough
[1:47:51] <+ComfortableStranger> @GarbageQueenEllie I feell a shit coming
[1:47:53] <peachy996> Maybe Yvonne didn't have enough time to be a full squadmate
[1:47:53] <%QueequegTheater> @peachy996 Bimbo Ashley > Miranda, all day
[1:47:57] <%rockcentuar> loved seeing the heads pop
[1:48:00] <choocheess> cerberus is the batarians of humanity
[1:48:03] <%andrewofbob> Given that weapon upgrades take longer to get than ability upgrades, I imagine power playthroughs are more viable on insanity
[1:48:12] <peachy996> @QueequegTheater Oh nononono I hate Bimbo Ash
[1:48:13] <choocheess> or jackals
[1:48:16] <%QueequegTheater> @peachy996 Probably more about $$$
[1:48:20] <dekkitout> When did James become fluent in dial up modem
[1:48:20] <%Theycallmenerf> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind Datapads give XP
[1:48:22] <%Lizard0TM> @PatStaresAt Having played the previous games and now ME3, how does ME3 feel compared to the others? I personally love the feel of ME3's gameplay the most
[1:48:24] <peachy996> Bimbo Ash is why I'm glad Pat killed her early
[1:48:29] <%LumberjackJack> We playin' Doom 3, now?
[1:48:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mohawk Jack tho
[1:48:38] <%LumberjackJack> D:
[1:48:38] <Grimmaru> Better MELEE if u takin that
[1:48:40] <+even_the_yuenglings> look at this doom shit
[1:48:43] <choocheess> Does Kaiden become an asshole spectre like ash?
[1:48:44] <secret_npc> Power is good for Insanity, but good weapons late game are invaluable
[1:48:46] <SaltyAzteca> thats dark
[1:48:48] <+Goraka91> Is it though?
[1:48:52] <peachy996> Yeah Mohawk Jack is cool
[1:48:56] <%QueequegTheater> BRUTALITY
[1:49:02] <stantheman_97> ashley bimboification is the only good thing about her tbh
[1:49:08] <%Theycallmenerf> @choocheess He is an asshole but then stuff happens and he’s not an asshole
[1:49:09] <+AmericanSkidd> hm
[1:49:10] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> who did this

[1:49:52] <$lotharrio> Also you're level 30.
[1:49:52] <GustauveVIII> Get one level of pull. It'll help against the Guardian variant of Cerberus troops.
[1:49:52] <choocheess> @Theycallmenerf i guess between the 2 of them they both need to give shep shit for cerberusing in ME2
[1:49:54] <+MrATheGreat> This was actually just a giant  game of among us when you thjnk about it.
[1:49:54] <rytisone> and this is on hardcore

[1:50:40] <+AmericanSkidd> You mean Morally Grey?
[1:50:42] <Lancaster_H> morally gray
[1:50:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> OH NO! Her breasts are huge that means she's evil!
[1:50:49] <+MrATheGreat> Blam headshot!
[1:50:50] <peachy996> Yeah
[1:50:56] <valriot> "Wow lady, you look very hot and robotic"
[1:50:56] <%Ipsenscastle> I should have realised it when her hair was a solid metal helmet
[1:50:58] <%Theycallmenerf> @choocheess I mean due to how ME2 is written you can’t get a word edgewise about why you’re with Cerberus, they just believe you betrayed them, betrayed the Alliance.
[1:50:58] <+Scevda> Theres an upgrade in the dark room. @patstaresat
[1:51:00] <peachy996> There's a lot of things she should have realized sooner
[1:51:02] <$lotharrio> Then shut up, Liara.
[1:51:04] <dawarw0lf> Yeah the game is easy because not all of the types are here
[1:51:08] <ChungusQuest> bloo-hoo
[1:51:08] <+vilecrois> "guess I'll just die then"
[1:51:08] <%Piemono> Did Cerberus make a robot so realistic that it could act human?
[1:51:09] <Grimmaru> Liara simpin
[1:51:10] <%HaroldDonchee> loser talk
[1:51:12] <%Wurmspawn> Liara was blinded by Dr. Eva's "hotness" and convinced herself that the doctor was simply morally gray.
[1:51:12] <%Theycallmenerf> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[1:51:14] <%QueequegTheater> "We should have a bunch of orgies instead"
[1:51:14] <dawarw0lf> I love steak, liara

[1:51:18] <+ComfortableStranger> @PatStaresAt  charge an nova give you i-frames, you can cancel nova to abuse this
[1:51:19] <+AmericanSkidd> uh

[1:51:25] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> you have no choice but to bang
[1:51:26] <%DrTomT18> No Choice
[1:51:27] <+tinytinykittycat> no
[1:51:27] <%Quigsies> i think so
[1:51:28] <+shapeforn> Ehhh I dont think so
[1:51:28] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> a KOTOR game like these mass effect games could be phenomenal
[1:51:28] <+RJay80> not a lock in
[1:51:28] <28moogles> say no choice
[1:51:29] <%watts121> Granted I'm pretty sure ME3's big tititus problem is the fact they only have one humanoid model, so everyone has rocking tits
[1:51:30] <+Goraka91> Nice choise? Oh so you wanna fuck?
[1:51:30] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> HARD
[1:51:31] <%QueequegTheater> I never romance this basic bitch, not sure
[1:51:31] <%LumberjackJack> No choice
[1:51:33] <choocheess> @Theycallmenerf yeah. Just Talk denied
[1:51:33] <%capnbeefs> Do it
[1:51:35] <peachy996> No Choice. Just to be sure
[1:51:35] <stantheman_97> just ping pong relationships
[1:51:35] <Grimmaru> Pick no choice
[1:51:37] <Laecerelius> say no choice
[1:51:39] <%aWanderingKaivo> lol
[1:51:39] <%weissguard> It's more explicit than this, iirc.
[1:51:39] <tommyboy96> I FUCKING LOVE STEAK
[1:51:40] <VentWilsn> nice timing liara with "ur always so focused" Kappa
[1:51:41] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> KISS THE WOMAN
[1:51:41] <+Soliloquy123> This game tries REALLY hard to make you love Liara and it honestly made me dislike the character.
[1:51:41] <+Scevda> Do it nerd
[1:51:42] <dawarw0lf> It won’t mess it up do it
[1:51:42] <wolfen091> duh pat
[1:51:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> "I just think of that sweet poisonous Qussy"
[1:51:44] <%HaroldDonchee> ha

[1:54:06] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Ha! She has no friends
[1:54:09] <%watts121> and this game is obviously old
[1:54:09] <%Piemono> Javik, a character so important that he shouldn't be DLC
[1:54:13] <+ComfortableStranger> are yall dreading the ending yet? cuz ya fucking should be
[1:54:17] <Grimmaru> Just btw Pat if you see this I've been watchin your stuff for like a decade and you're my favorite streamer on the citadel
[1:54:19] <+Getter404> Everyone keeps leaving scopes in the cafeteria. Read the damn memo folks
[1:54:22] <%Theycallmenerf> @piemono RIGHT?!
[1:54:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> You'd think she'd learn how to network as the fucking shadow broker
[1:54:26] <randoli_spugoli> @patstaresat if you don't give your old love interest A definitive answer, they have a catfight with your current love interest
[1:54:30] <peachy996> I'm dreading Kai Leng more
[1:54:38] <%LumberjackJack> Crazy that Vigil never mentioned this plot device in ME1
[1:54:41] <choocheess> i wish they've mod a complete retconned ending
[1:54:44] <+Buzzkill983> Jenson, you saved the Prothean McGuffin, right?
[1:54:45] <%Rain_Mage> Fling a light into the future
[1:54:47] <Profmcstevie> The future fighters might win this war
[1:54:49] <DSD24> I love the Biotic Punch
[1:54:50] <+AmericanSkidd> It took hundreds of years when the Reapers came in the way they always did
[1:54:51] <+condemned_15> You got a guide for the armor and gun mods?
[1:54:51] <SaltyAzteca> that run LUL
[1:54:53] <dawarw0lf> There a thing about the plot device that makes me like it more that’s later revealed
[1:54:56] <%QueequegTheater> Kappa
[1:55:02] <%Theycallmenerf> PAT YOU GOTTA RENEGADE INTERRUPT KAI LENG
[1:55:03] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Vanguard has a unique dashing heavy melee
[1:55:03] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> @Sphincter_Spelunker I just want a game that you could romance star wars aliens and use blasters, but not lightsabers ,because they always break games
[1:55:04] <%DrTomT18> Vigil was made long after the Reaper War ended and Javik was frozen
[1:55:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> shhh don't worry about it
[1:55:08] <choocheess> wtf is this fallout 4 crafting bench?!
[1:55:14] <%count_bob> He didn't know about them. @PatStaresAt
[1:55:17] <%lloyddboy> DO IT
[1:55:17] <%DrTomT18> he probably didn't know about the Weapon
[1:55:20] <dawarw0lf> The plot device and how “long” it’s been a thing makes me like it more.
[1:55:22] <Grimmaru> NO WEAPON NOW
[1:55:23] <%Theycallmenerf> Javik is the shit
[1:55:23] <+Goraka91> He didn't know due to the collapse of Prothean civilization which makes sense, but yeah still retcon vibes
[1:55:24] <DatAsuna> Vigil wouldn't know, he said the planets were cut off an isolated from each other at the start of the invasion and that ilos went dark to avoid detection
[1:55:26] <%count_bob> That was just one cut off group of scientists.
[1:55:27] <secret_npc> Can only go no weapon in Multiplayer
[1:55:29] <%MidnightBurst12> no balls
[1:55:29] <peachy996> Oh yeah you can find mods on guns to make them lighter
[1:55:31] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Vigil and the protheans on ILO were isolated remember?
[1:55:32] <%Ipsenscastle> I mean you can't expect Vigil to know everysingle thing that happened in the galaxy, shit's compartmentalised
[1:55:32] <Marakami_Sadaneo> cirYep I forgot about this shit in ME3
[1:55:38] <VentWilsn> MELEE ONLY RUN Kappa
[1:55:40] <secret_npc> Only in Multiplayer
[1:55:41] <Grimmaru> Never use it
[1:55:43] <%Aleate> Pistol AND SMG is still the same +200%
[1:55:43] <%Theycallmenerf> Chat when should Pat do Citadel DLC :0

[1:55:50] <peachy996> So you won't ALWAYS need a pistol for 200+ Weight Capacity
[1:55:54] <%NeoCre> @lumberjackjack To be fair, he was only familiar with what that specific small group of protheans that had cut all contact
[1:55:55] <Marakami_Sadaneo> LUL
[1:55:56] <+AmericanSkidd> wow
[1:55:57] <Grimmaru> WOAH WATCH YOUR PROFANITY
[1:55:58] <stantheman_97> this was probably a completely separate batch of survivors
[1:55:59] <karl_rex> missed an upgrade
[1:55:59] <DatAsuna> Vigil says in ME1 Ilos was shut off from the rest of the empire
[1:55:59] <SaltyAzteca> BUTTHEAD
[1:56:01] <%James_Quivers> the vigil group of protheons and these ones were completely cut off from one another

[2:02:41] <KeystoneA2> @peachy996 Only when you can't hack them
[2:02:46] <%Romuken> Man, someone make that turret's fire cycle from target to target down to .2 for real.  My shadowrun rigger would be ashamed.
[2:02:53] <DatAsuna> BTW you can combo the non-heavy melee for 3 regular hits

[2:03:16] <4DLuvOfLuthy> its extremely fun lol
[2:03:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also you have a three hit melee combo
[2:03:21] <+Buzzkill983> Apex Predator Shepherd
[2:03:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @peachy996 I hate the collector swarms and abominations more
[2:03:24] <dawarw0lf> This is also one class pat. 5 others.
[2:03:27] <%DrTomT18> man, the fact that there is no Botic Lightning power is bullshit
[2:03:34] <rytisone> curse you Kakarot, I mean Shepard
[2:03:35] <%MugenSandan> Okay but where's the mod to make Shepherd shout POWAAA DUUNK
[2:03:37] <DatAsuna> Only on targets
[2:03:38] <%andrewofbob> Have to hit someone
[2:03:38] <%Romuken> how he do it
[2:03:38] <%NeoCre> Go no gun, become punch
[2:03:39] <+Goraka91> Need to actually hit things
[2:03:41] <%aWanderingKaivo> only if it connects
[2:03:42] <DatAsuna> You can't combo it on thin air
[2:03:42] <%captain_kirkhammer> the heavcy melkee
[2:03:42] <+DracosMagala> Scions suck in mp
[2:03:44] <%LumberjackJack> Yeah, but it's inferior to heavy melee or Nova
[2:03:44] <%QueequegTheater> Tippy taps
[2:03:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> on hit
[2:03:46] <LunarRemix> Only when you hit things
[2:03:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, but you need a target @PatStaresAt

[2:04:14] <%ssjklyco> Imagine getting the Cerberus memo to kill  Shepard, the man who was hard to kill before and they rebuilt into a more unkillable Cyborg.

[2:05:36] <dekkitout> It seems very reasonable to assume Shep was Winter Soldier'd
[2:05:36] <%Wurmspawn> WHY would you destroy the collector base if your were a mindless puppet?
[2:05:37] <$lotharrio> You should have the option to just shoot him at that question.
[2:05:38] <Grimmaru> Why does his character model look worse than the rest
[2:05:38] <%QueequegTheater> >rubs sweat off forehaed skin with sharp metal plate
[2:05:38] <choocheess> Kaiden can fuck off back to Earth, just shutup or leave
[2:05:40] <+akscully> let's smooch instead
[2:05:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Kaiden, if you'd open your damn EYES for two seconds, you'd see he hasn't changed
[2:05:47] <AluxStreams> Kaidan sounds like a conspiracy nut.
[2:05:47] <%Piemen99> You gotta fuck him

[2:05:52] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> "I don't know what you are, but don't explain it". I want a bullet in Kaiden's head already.

[2:07:08] <%QueequegTheater> Because you're bad at melee
[2:07:11] <%DrTomT18> Only with Rifles I think
[2:07:12] <FlyguyJP> Vanguard is an all or nothing build. Either you are OP as fuck or get rocked instantly
[2:07:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt I guess it's a level up reward.
[2:07:13] <peachy996> Doing it wrong then
[2:07:14] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Pat never reads
[2:07:14] <+fetrigon> nice
[2:07:15] <Grimmaru> powerful shield
[2:07:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> that, uh, doesn't work
[2:07:16] <+condemned_15> wack em
[2:07:16] <%king_wragles> STOP PUNCHING HIS SHIELD
[2:07:18] <KeystoneA2> his health melted though
[2:07:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh no we lied
[2:07:20] <SaltyAzteca> IM FUCKIN INVINCIBLE
[2:07:21] <%andrewofbob> Those shields are pretty good
[2:07:21] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL WHAT THE FUCK HE HAS A SHIELD PANIIIIIC
[2:07:21] <HyperionXV> Those are some tough shields
[2:07:23] <%Lizard0TM> you gotta spam b when trying to do the 3 hit
[2:07:24] <Sigma_190_Beta> Sorry about that.
[2:07:24] <%MugenSandan> Sheppard KNUCKLE
[2:07:26] <secret_npc> YOU HAVE LIARA, PAT, USE HER
[2:07:27] <DatAsuna> that is not it yeah, the three hit combo is 2 hooks
[2:07:33] <Grimmaru> YOU CANT HIT ME JACK
[2:07:34] <peachy996> Mash
[2:07:37] <$Mekhet09> Too bad they didn't ad melee weapons.
[2:07:45] <%lloyddboy> reave is sick it can start and end biotic combos iirc
[2:07:46] <Mattais88> Thessia Smash!
[2:07:47] <%AncelDeLambert> I'M FUCKING INVINCIBLE
[2:07:47] <+ComfortableStranger> @secret_npc sexually
[2:07:48] <+AmericanSkidd> oh no a piece of metal, my one weakness
[2:07:49] <choocheess> @secret_npc use the liara!
[2:07:49] <Saffry_Ruzin> I remember it wouldn't work for me either, maybe it's not in LE?
[2:07:53] <secret_npc> singularity the shield man
[2:07:54] <Dunmarkh> @Mekhet09 those are in andromeda
[2:07:56] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat are you telling me YOU can't mash enough to activate the combo
[2:07:58] <Profmcstevie> I do think a biotic blade woulda been cool
[2:07:58] <DSD24> Didn't a Krogan in the multiplayer get a hammer?
[2:07:59] <%Romuken> The fuck's a guy suppose to do when you come at him and start BREAKING HIS SHIELD with your bare fist?
[2:08:00] <+Scevda> Mash, this isnt a fighting game
[2:08:01] <lancer1314> I had to download a mod that restored the three hit combo.
[2:08:01] <+ComfortableStranger> @lloyddboy yup
[2:08:04] <%andrewofbob> @Mekhet09 Some MP characters have swords and hammers
[2:08:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat uses Liara, it's super effective
[2:08:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> singularity > shields
[2:08:11] <DatAsuna> it would be stupid to remove it in LE
[2:08:18] <%Ipsenscastle> zoom zoom
[2:08:20] <FlyguyJP> Power Walk
[2:08:21] <DatAsuna> @lancer1314 wait LE seriously broke the combo???
[2:08:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> SUPER BIOTIC SPEED
[2:08:27] <+ComfortableStranger> @Profmcstevie prefer to smash
[2:08:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat trying to Kill Bill that dude's shield
[2:08:31] <peachy996> You have to mash it
[2:08:31] <DatAsuna> Man fuck this remaster
[2:08:31] <SaltyAzteca> Runs like a constipated turtle
[2:08:34] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can kill Guardians immediately after you charge if you move behind them while you nova.
[2:08:35] <%Lizard0TM> they did not remove it from LE
[2:08:36] <peachy996> Is what I think it is
[2:08:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the sunset has rubbed off
[2:08:41] <%Lizard0TM> if it's not working, it's a bug
[2:08:44] <Saffry_Ruzin> it worked just fine when I did it in OG ME3 MP, but I couldn't do it yesterday in LE
[2:08:48] <peachy996> You have to mash it so you get the combo
[2:08:49] <%aWanderingKaivo> lol the three hit basic melee is not that big a deal man
[2:08:54] <%QueequegTheater> OH MY GOD THE LE BROKE THE MELEE COMBO
[2:08:59] <%QueequegTheater> YOU FUCKING CLOWNS
[2:09:01] <lancer1314> @lancer1314 Yeah, but a small mod adds it back in.
[2:09:02] <FlashFennec> Vanguard is seriously the best player class in any shooter, ever
[2:09:05] <AthenaAegis> DOOM 3 Kappa
[2:09:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 0/10
[2:09:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> heavy melee is almost always better anyway
[2:09:10] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Bakoom
[2:09:12] <dawarw0lf> I’m pretty sure the three hit thing is a MP THING GUYS.
[2:09:12] <%GabeSweetMan> That looked like shit!
[2:09:14] <+Havictos> @QueequegTheater for real?
[2:09:15] <+Goraka91> @QueequegTheater It did?
[2:09:16] <+JustToWatch> Pat just use Heavenly Shepard Buster
[2:09:17] <%Blackleafx> Somebody set us up the bomb
[2:09:17] <peachy996> It's not a big deal but it does make the Vanguard more fun
[2:09:20] <%AncelDeLambert> BWAAAAAAAAM
[2:09:22] <dawarw0lf> Like god
[2:09:22] <choocheess> man im really glad the music's more like ME1's
[2:09:22] <%RetroCop87> BWWOOOOOMMMM
[2:09:23] <+Scevda> @awanderingkaivo true
[2:09:27] <DatAsuna> @aWanderingKaivo There's no reason for there to be any missing content whatsoever
[2:09:28] <Grimmaru> This stream in particular is clip heaven
[2:09:32] <FlyguyJP> It also looked like shit in ME3 originally. Good remaster
[2:09:34] <Saffry_Ruzin> I can live without the combo, but still sucks it's fone
[2:09:37] <secret_npc> If any mod needs to be added, it's to remove that hideous vignette
[2:09:43] <peachy996> Weird
[2:09:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> no but its not like it ruins the game
[2:09:49] <peachy996> Oh well!
[2:09:53] <+Buzzkill983> Why send a tram then?
[2:09:54] <+ComfortableStranger> @aWanderingKaivo sure there is, laziness
[2:09:59] <peachy996> Heavy Melee is what you want more anyway
[2:10:02] <%AncelDeLambert> this decade's overuse and subsequent bastardization of horns is exasperating
[2:10:03] <+AmericanSkidd> it was very cool of them
[2:10:03] <dawarw0lf> MP had melee combos chat your dumb
[2:10:04] <dd44dostivei> ive never seen a combo. was it MP only?
[2:10:05] <%afronooch> noo tramics
[2:10:08] <FlyguyJP> Yeah. All they had to do was NOT send a team to kill you and you would have died
[2:10:10] <DatAsuna> Sure, but don't make fun of people for having small complaints
[2:10:13] <$realm_forge> I love the Mummy style sandstorm that’s rolling in on the horizon in this area
[2:10:15] <%JoshManVGH> Tram Upgrade courtesy of Space Assholes
[2:10:15] <%AncelDeLambert> I HATE horns now, thanks Hollywood
[2:10:15] <Marakami_Sadaneo> They cant aim that's why
[2:10:17] <%gliph13> Y'know had they they just left them there, Cerberus would have totally won.
[2:10:17] <+tinytinykittycat> they could have just left you there
[2:10:21] <+even_the_yuenglings> the combo isnt a big deal
[2:10:24] <tengel66> new tram, fam
[2:10:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> your small complaint was "fuck this game" man
[2:10:27] <%Ipsenscastle> I only ever did the combo in MP
[2:10:28] <dawarw0lf> @dd44dostivei Yes I don’t know why everyone is being so dumb
[2:10:31] <peachy996> ARRRRRGH
[2:10:31] <%aWanderingKaivo> or remaster rather
[2:10:37] <peachy996> Shep is angry
[2:10:38] <%NeoCre> Big deal, terrible
[2:10:39] <%JoshManVGH> God damn Vanguard is so much cooler in this game!
[2:10:39] <KeystoneA2> HWAAAAUGH
[2:10:41] <%QueequegTheater> Christ, it's like if you gave John Wick the Force
[2:10:42] <%LumberjackJack> "HOLY SHIT, IT'S SHEPARD!" There's a Rogue One-ish moment
[2:10:43] <+Goraka91> LUL
[2:10:49] <%Lizard0TM> lmao
[2:10:50] <DatAsuna> @aWanderingKaivo And?
[2:10:52] <+ComfortableStranger> Pat understands soft cover, yes?
[2:10:53] <stantheman_97> LUL LUL LUL
[2:10:56] <+Tizona824> RAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:11:00] <+akscully> love that they recognize you
[2:11:04] <akitanito> what's the cooldown on these abilities
[2:11:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> so I'm gonna make fun of an overreaction
[2:11:05] <DSD24> Pat solos ME3 L
[2:11:06] <%lloyddboy> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:11:06] <FlyguyJP> God damn the Vanguard rush spam is so broken
[2:11:08] <%Blackleafx> Shepard RAWR
[2:11:08] <Marakami_Sadaneo> LUL
[2:11:11] <Profmcstevie> More vocal than an arcsystem game
[2:11:13] <+AmericanSkidd> Shepard is finally letting loose
[2:11:16] <rytisone> come on and slam
[2:11:17] <+Havictos> @dawarw0lf They're not it's in single player too
[2:11:18] <%JoshManVGH> Was this all shit you could do in Multiplayer?
[2:11:20] <%cvp5127> shepard smash
[2:11:20] <DatAsuna> Nova has no cooldown
[2:11:20] <AthenaAegis> POWER.......GEYSER!!!
[2:11:21] <Marakami_Sadaneo> man really kept shooting at the glass
[2:11:21] <dawarw0lf> The fact that combo melee was only in MP yet it’s why “this remaster sucks” is being sad is baffling. You WANT to hate this game.
[2:11:23] <secret_npc> If you go into Photo Mode, you can see what the game looks like without the vignette around the border, it looks soooo much better, god
[2:11:28] <President_Pariah> oh god...it's gonna be the same voice clip of 'AAAAUUUUUGGG!!!' for 30 hours
[2:11:30] <%DrTomT18> the burst boy
[2:11:31] <%Rumbutt> @JoshManVGH yes
[2:11:33] <KeystoneA2> @JoshManVGH yes -- and more
[2:11:33] <choocheess> Whoever said vanguard wasn't as good in ME3 was full of shit
[2:11:34] <DatAsuna> @JoshManVGH MP had waaaaay more shit than this
[2:11:36] <%DrTomT18> Pat do you plan on using weapons at all
[2:11:40] <%andrewofbob> AR
[2:11:40] <dekkitout> Vindicator? I barely knew her?
[2:11:42] <FlashFennec> You could do MORE than this in Multiplayer. Krogan Vanguards, man
[2:11:42] <%gliph13> Someone in ME2 streams said Vanguard wasn't as good in ME3. that person was a HUGE LIAR!
[2:11:43] <Saffry_Ruzin> @joshmanvgh  Way more
[2:11:46] <+tinytinykittycat> good riffle
[2:11:47] <FlyguyJP> Burst rifle I think?
[2:11:48] <peachy996> The combo is just more fluff to the Vanguard meat, it's no big deal
[2:11:49] <choocheess> SMG
[2:11:50] <+even_the_yuenglings> you guys are just trying to hate the game at this point
[2:11:52] <%lloyddboy> burst
[2:11:53] <%QueequegTheater> @DrTomT18 Why would he
[2:11:55] <%Shubreaker> my beloved
[2:11:55] <+MrATheGreat> 3 round burst
[2:11:56] <+ComfortableStranger> its burst
[2:11:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> good ole Vindi
[2:11:58] <%LumberjackJack> Weight capacity upgrade is good for that reason
[2:11:59] <+D00msDayDan> hell yeah avenger
[2:12:00] <+Buzzkill983> Yes
[2:12:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 3 burst
[2:12:02] <peachy996> Yeah
[2:12:04] <%DrTomT18> because the gun play is GOOD
[2:12:06] <+MrATheGreat> it not bad
[2:12:09] <%Lizard0TM> it's a battle rifle
[2:12:10] <peachy996> 200% is because you have the one gun
[2:12:10] <secret_npc> Vindicator is a good
[2:12:11] <+Scevda> One of them
[2:12:12] <DSD24> I like going Assault shotgun with a Vanguard
[2:12:14] <DatAsuna> It's not a big deal, but the legendary edition shouldn't be missing any content in the first place
[2:12:16] <%JoshManVGH> God damn it! And they didn't bring it back for LE!? Im sorry retroactively salty now!
[2:12:17] <Saffry_Ruzin> @joshmanvgh  I always played a Collector that had Frieza's death ball
[2:12:20] <tattleworm> vanguard with no shotgun doesn't feel right
[2:12:21] <%snugglepuggs> Ur favorite Pat
[2:12:22] <FlyguyJP> Full Auto for life. I follow the philosophy of MOAR DAKKA
[2:12:25] <%ahomeschooldropout> say what you will about the story but the gameplay changes they made for ME3 are phenominal
[2:12:26] <+MrATheGreat> more health damage iirc
[2:12:29] <rytisone> Krang hates it
[2:12:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> EQUIP THAT
[2:12:31] <%captain_kirkhammer> Mods are back! In POG form!
[2:12:36] <DSD24> Shotgun SMG is a good combo too
[2:12:36] <+kastev> How far into the ME3 story are we?
[2:12:38] <%DrTomT18> I mean watching him use the same three moves is kinda lame. You gotta mix thinks up
[2:12:38] <Sp3ctre48> A lot of the base game weapons in ME3 are really bad unfortunately
[2:12:40] <%andrewofbob> You can have assault rifle vanguard. YOU CAN HAVE ASSULT RIFLE ENGINEER
[2:12:41] <Aiutare47> honestly having decent guns is better than having 200% cooldown
[2:12:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Sphincter_Spelunker He can't yet.
[2:12:45] <%JoshManVGH> @saffry_ruzin What!?
[2:12:47] <+condemned_15> makes Turtle Soup
[2:12:50] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[2:12:51] <DSD24> @kastev Still in the Intro basically
[2:12:51] <+ComfortableStranger> @tattleworm talon pistol is acceptable
[2:12:52] <%afronooch> @kastev the start
[2:12:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> like if the heavy melee was gone I'd agree, maybe there are situations where the combo is better but I always felt like the heavy melee is better
[2:12:55] <homestylewaffles> it's a PS5 Pro
[2:12:57] <choocheess> man i really wish i could inhale that green air
[2:13:00] <FlyguyJP> Careful chat, CAREFUL.
[2:13:00] <%QueequegTheater> @Aiutare47 Lol no
[2:13:00] <+Buzzkill983> I think Avenger is the lightest rifle if I am remembering right? I think you can do Avenger with the lighter shotguns
[2:13:01] <peachy996> A Vanguard is not a vanguard without a shottie in their hands. That's just me though
[2:13:01] <mighty_fine_trousers> Didn't he miss something in that little room?
[2:13:01] <+AmericanSkidd> Oh, its you...
[2:13:02] <dekkitout> Videogames taught me to not trust thus color of green
[2:13:04] <secret_npc> Hey guys, should Pat go for Melee armor or Power armor?
[2:13:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> @drtomt18 it's an RPG, who cares tho
[2:13:06] <GuyverTypeL> @kastev The very beggining really
[2:13:06] <DSD24> Its the Ellusive Dick
[2:13:06] <tattleworm> @tattleworm true
[2:13:08] <dawarw0lf> “I can’t believe ME3 LE doesn’t have this thing that was never in the original”
[2:13:08] <%Blackleafx> timmy boi
[2:13:09] <%JoshManVGH> Oh goddamn it
[2:13:09] <$Faustgesicht> Hey buddy!
[2:13:10] <%DrTomT18> His name is Jack, actually
[2:13:11] <$Teh_Un> Paragon him
[2:13:14] <akitanito> liara pls, what's the point of the gun
[2:13:15] <%QueequegTheater> @secret_npc power
[2:13:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> drip man
[2:13:17] <Seth_Tek> Martin sheen we me again...
[2:13:17] <+kastev> ty
[2:13:17] <%LumberjackJack> TIM got a downgrade this game, writing-wise
[2:13:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Liara wtf are you doing
[2:13:18] <%JoshManVGH> Tim?
[2:13:18] <DatAsuna> @Aiutare47 Not really, you can only shoot one gun at a time, so it's better to have a super power gun or two AND the 200%
[2:13:19] <peachy996> The start of idiocy
[2:13:23] <+Scevda> @aiutare47 outright false but its not exactly a hard game so all sorts of valid builds.
[2:13:23] <KeystoneA2> @JoshManVGH Oh yeah MP had loads of awesome shit. Like biotic whips, Krogan Battlemasters with giant hammers, Geth Primes, teleporting attacks like Kasumi's in ME2. Best part of ME3.
[2:13:23] <stantheman_97> long time no see fuckface
[2:13:24] <%Romuken> clean?
[2:13:24] <Saffry_Ruzin> @joshmanvgh  Look up ME3 Awakened Collector, it was a character you could play
[2:13:24] <choocheess> speaking of air why were they wearing helmet if they never needed it to breathe
[2:13:24] <+condemned_15> ME2 music
[2:13:25] <dekkitout> Larry, he's a ghost. Put the gun away
[2:13:26] <DatAsuna> rather than 5 guns and shit cooldown
[2:13:26] <dawarw0lf> Make sure to info him
[2:13:27] <+Dova573> Shoot him now
[2:13:28] <LunarRemix> He's so handsome
[2:13:31] <%JoshManVGH> Oh the illusive man
[2:13:37] <+AmericanSkidd> He wants the 5 Gum
[2:13:42] <+ComfortableStranger> weapons get lighter  as you level the, you can only level them up half way in one playthrough
[2:13:44] <Mattais88> Hey you know hwat helps people, not killing an entire base of them
[2:13:45] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> protean juice

[2:13:58] <+MrATheGreat> reapa'd
[2:13:59] <FlyguyJP> Illusive Man was morally grey in ME2 but he went full crazy in 3. Bioware made him drink the magic coolaid
[2:14:00] <Aiutare47> 200% cooldown on charge is no good against shit like brutes and banshees
[2:14:02] <%QueequegTheater> FUCK I FORGOT

[2:21:37] <dekkitout> "And then Joker can get in me"
[2:21:37] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> The senate will decide your fate
[2:21:37] <FlyguyJP> EDI wastes literally zero time to steal that shit
[2:21:38] <%Piemen99> are there no doctors on the ship?

[2:21:42] <%Wurmspawn> Chackwas left the alliance to be on the ship before. This is now an alliance crewed ship.
[2:21:43] <williamrooster> The robot is a bad design it’s to top heavy
[2:21:44] <%SaiyanShoto> 5second rule on the robot
[2:21:44] <+ComfortableStranger> @YakumoYomi not yet
[2:21:51] <%NeoCre> Everyone got kicked off the ship, it was in storage
[2:21:51] <+tinytinykittycat> It should have been Legions new body
[2:21:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> He still got picked up by the face and whipped around
[2:21:55] <%demiiluna> "I can learn how to fuck Joker in that thing."
[2:21:59] <atema128> I like Liara but I hate that she’s a creator’s pet the game forces onto you.
[2:21:59] <choocheess> what if Kaiden was in the rest of the game with a big goofy neckbrace?
[2:22:03] <secret_npc> Imagine playing ME3 for the first time and not knowing who the fuck Joker or Edi were
[2:22:04] <+Thedoobiousone> for stealth missions the hair can change to be more like real hair
[2:22:04] <+Egg0fTheKing> there's dialogue later talking about how the robot hair mesh can convert to strands when in disguise
[2:22:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> why would you be worried about cerberus?
[2:22:13] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> Admiral keith davis ?

[2:22:39] <+unhuggable1> Deathstar for sure
[2:22:39] <dawarw0lf> @williamrooster I know it’s just a joke but it’s because it’s an infiltration unit. It was designed to have sex appeal
[2:22:39] <choocheess> Pat romance Liara in 1 and Tali in 2

[2:23:10] <$hattrick61> @kastev liara and tali. the correct (mshep) choices
[2:23:11] <holyxgrale> Was there any reason why the Reapers came to earth first?
[2:23:11] <+kastev> How is Shepard not like one of the most highest rank people in the military
[2:23:11] <KeystoneA2> Vigil's theme plays softly in the War Room's ambient
[2:23:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> What if it was just a galactic suicide bomb as a "fuck you, you don't win" to the reapers
[2:23:13] <FlyguyJP> Real-Talk they start building that thing with no idea what it does. And it is MASSIVE.
[2:23:13] <%JoshManVGH> It's a blueprint, a weapon to surpass Metal Gear!

[2:23:22] <%andrewofbob> SR2 got a refurbish
[2:23:23] <blue8moon> maybe they redid the com room
[2:23:24] <%cvp5127> "but are you sure earth is being attacked"
[2:23:25] <%dooscent> the alliance fucked around with the ship a bit
[2:23:28] <+OG_M_Bison> Uh.... yea
[2:23:29] <%Wurmspawn> This is where the old com room used to be.
[2:23:30] <+OG_M_Bison> What???
[2:23:30] <+kastev> @hattrick61 That is correct
[2:23:32] <wolfen091> ship is much different
[2:23:33] <IntrepidEye> The Alliance basically rip the internals apart and rebuilt it
[2:23:33] <peachy996> So I'm not crazy
[2:23:35] <peachy996> Good
[2:23:36] <+OG_M_Bison> Liara what the fuck are you talking about???
[2:23:37] <%CalderGaming> how far did pat get in me3 last time?

[2:23:39] <+AmericanSkidd> like waaaaay worse
[2:23:41] <secret_npc> I miss the ME1 Normandy music
[2:23:42] <FlyguyJP> Galactic Apocalypse
[2:23:42] <+condemned_15> Mordin's Lab was gutted and turned into the War Room
[2:23:42] <%Romuken> Liara.  Camera pans across Shepard.  Miranda's there instead with a gun yelling THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE
[2:23:43] <%JoshManVGH> It looks like it's part of the cargobay or something, under where Zaveed or Grunt were @patstaresat
[2:23:45] <%MightyDuckShoes> LENSFLARES
[2:23:47] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, it's been a year and a half

[2:23:55] <+Havictos> nope war room
[2:23:56] <Mattais88> nope
[2:23:56] <$realm_forge> One thing I like about ME3 is that a lot of Shepard’s victories are messy
[2:23:57] <narusao> next to the disco ball
[2:23:57] <%Ipsenscastle> nope
[2:23:57] <+tinytinykittycat> remodeled to fuck
[2:23:57] <teebos> nope

[2:24:00] <choocheess> it's the ebon hawk now
[2:24:02] <wolfen091> no, this is war room, where morning was
[2:24:03] <%weissguard> You're in a room that Wrex would love

[2:24:04] <Maids4lyfe> new room
[2:24:04] <$LightningLynx89> War Room
[2:24:05] <+AmericanSkidd> You'll enjoy the tour
[2:24:05] <wolfen091> mordin
[2:24:07] <tattleworm> this room's very BSG inspired
[2:24:08] <%dooscent> Big... Gun...
[2:24:08] <%LumberjackJack> It's behind the briefing room. Galaxy map room and most of the ship is still the same
[2:24:11] <ShiningAxis> alliance was refitting the ship to get rid of the cerberus paint
[2:24:12] <FlyguyJP> They added a security checkpoint to the ship.... for some reason
[2:24:13] <%captain_kirkhammer> @CalderGaming firstr dream sequence
[2:24:13] <secret_npc> Aw
[2:24:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt It's actually Jacob's room.
[2:24:14] <+Scevda> Nooe
[2:24:15] <williamrooster> the alliance renovated it
[2:24:17] <falyden> a galaxy gun
[2:24:18] <$realm_forge> Not quite
[2:24:20] <%andrewofbob> What if the weapon is a sword?
[2:24:21] <DSD24> Shepard has the big sad
[2:24:24] <%Blackleafx> Mr Evrart is helping me find-
[2:24:25] <%MightyDuckShoes> Hit the Blussy
[2:24:25] <%Wurmspawn> They took out mordin's lab and the conference room and replaced them with a smaller conference room, this room and a much smaller com room.
[2:24:28] <choocheess> it's a little energy girl to fight the little energy boy
[2:24:32] <+tinytinykittycat> He looks soo tired
[2:24:34] <@commanderclaw> "Reapers"
[2:24:34] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:24:34] <dawarw0lf> Can’t yet
[2:24:38] <%GabeSweetMan> ME3: No.
[2:24:40] <%mister___doctor> mister___doctor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! Hey Pat. Yo, ain't this that poopy assdick game that everyone hates? Never played it myself, but it seems like it had a mass effect on the community.
[2:24:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wonder which outfit Pat'll pick?
[2:24:42] <Profmcstevie> Let Shep sprint in his SHIRT
[2:24:44] <peachy996> Citadel first
[2:24:44] <dawarw0lf> After this part you can pat
[2:24:45] <+even_the_yuenglings> theres tone of crew interactions around the shipe
[2:24:45] <+unhuggable1> @PatStaresAt is this your first playthrough of ME3 or naw
[2:24:47] <wolfen091> too bad, citadel first
[2:24:47] <VentWilsn> do u think that line was used for the trailers?
[2:24:48] <%JoshManVGH> How did they get to Citadel Space to fast!?!?
[2:24:49] <KeystoneA2> "Nah."
[2:24:49] <+AmericanSkidd> No citadel first to do chores
[2:24:50] <+Chaos_Aether> yet
[2:24:50] <blackjack8182> Nope
[2:24:51] <+Scevda> @flyguyjp loading space
[2:24:52] <+ComfortableStranger> @commanderclaw we've dismissed this claim
[2:24:52] <ErikFeral> you assumed too much of Mass Effect 3
[2:24:53] <FlyguyJP> Reapers too busy fucking Earth
[2:24:55] <+Havictos> you can go back on
[2:24:55] <+tinytinykittycat> soon
[2:24:55] <dd44dostivei> no sovereign pollination
[2:25:01] <DSD24> @GarbageQueenEllie The Hoodie for sure
[2:25:02] <Mattais88> It is the middle of nowhere
[2:25:02] <%ssjklyco> Shepard needs to see if his sheets still smells like Tali
[2:25:02] <falyden> ah the original music
[2:25:04] <willyfreshness> "Pffft Fuck off Shepard, What Reapers?"
[2:25:04] <%JoshManVGH> Aren't the Mass Relays offline?
[2:25:05] <+unhuggable1> ok so yes basically
[2:25:08] <%YakumoYomi> Batarian's got hit first, then Earth (I think)
[2:25:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah I forgot how on rails the beginning of this is
[2:25:09] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> Reapers are colossal ships that leave in space ???
[2:25:10] <%captain_kirkhammer> He got to the first dream sequence
[2:25:11] <peachy996> You played as far up to the Citadel if I recall
[2:25:11] <+Chaos_Aether> you never finished it?
[2:25:11] <Sp3ctre48> Still not sure WHY the Reapers aren't attacking the Citadel but whatever
[2:25:13] <%GabeSweetMan> Same. All the ending backlash killed my enthusiasm.
[2:25:13] <JetpackMcQuack> oh dam
[2:25:14] <fluffy_sauce> why only 90mins?
[2:25:16] <secret_npc> "Hey normies, here's the Citadel, it's big but not as cool as ME1"
[2:25:17] <$hattrick61> the old machinima video
[2:25:19] <Marakami_Sadaneo> But you do know the endings right?
[2:25:20] <hippofant> @PatStaresAt Why did you stop after 90 minutes? did something happen?
[2:25:22] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:25:23] <peachy996> That's when Matt dropped the much needed Kung Pow reference
[2:25:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> @DSD24 I'm quite fond of the Citadel leather jacket, myself
[2:25:25] <%captain_kirkhammer> @YakumoYomi they got fucking *wiped*
[2:25:27] <+unhuggable1> nice
[2:25:30] <SaltyAzteca> @Sp3ctre48 They got they ass whooped the first time
[2:25:32] <+AmericanSkidd> a fast 90 minutes im sure
[2:25:33] <ErikFeral> imagine the Council still be sh!ts about acknowledging the Reapers even existing
[2:25:34] <+flexin_apex> Oh wow that’s barely anything
[2:25:35] <FlyguyJP> @JoshManVGH No you are thinking of something else
[2:25:35] <TourettesPlays> Mashitima? Whats that???
[2:25:37] <%Blackleafx> WHY
[2:25:38] <peachy996> Let me know if you see a Radioshack lol
[2:25:38] <GuyverTypeL> We'll bang okay?
[2:25:40] <%Wurmspawn> @JoshManVGH If that was true then interstellar travel would be screwed.

[2:28:38] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt There are some ambient conversations on the Citadel that can complete over time. If you finish all their dialogue, you can complete some of them for positive or negative outcomes.

[2:28:57] <secret_npc> I hate Avina
[2:28:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Can we sandbag Allers super hard and just not have her on the ship?
[2:29:02] <Marakami_Sadaneo> creepy AI
[2:29:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Like at all?
[2:29:05] <peachy996> I swear Avina looked creepier as the games went on
[2:29:09] <ExpressNode> What's the story behind Chobo or whatever?
[2:29:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> What a great way for soldier morale to evaporate instantly, don't allow them to really contact their loved ones
[2:29:15] <%QueequegTheater> "Yeah, that's pretty much fair"
[2:29:18] <Sp3ctre48> You can but we need the content
[2:29:19] <%MidnightBurst12> I don't like her eyes
[2:29:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Chocobo
[2:29:23] <+condemned_15> C-Sec can C-SUCK MY NUTS
[2:29:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> You also have to wear your helmet to all Citadel buildings
[2:29:24] <%Ipsenscastle> @GarbageNirvana that's how I did it
[2:29:24] <+unhuggable1> wonder why
[2:29:25] <%QueequegTheater> O_O
[2:29:26] <+Scevda> @patstaresat gotta enter and exit an area to go through a full convo
[2:29:26] <%JohnAtDawn> She means refugees
[2:29:33] <dawarw0lf> Avina used to have nips in the og me3
[2:29:34] <FlyguyJP> Just a few influx given the... trouble on Earth
[2:29:36] <secret_npc> Chobotics is content, Pat would never ditch her
[2:29:39] <%Blackleafx> Woah the echo fucked up
[2:29:44] <+unhuggable1> i like the old avina
[2:29:44] <%gliph13> @PatStaresAt  Keep note that Citadel and it's Side missions change after every "Priority" mission.
[2:29:46] <peachy996> Cita Dil
[2:29:48] <hippofant> Building a hospital in the giant skybridge doesn't seem like the best idea in case of an emergency.
[2:29:49] <%captain_kirkhammer> @Scevda naw you just gotta walk away and come back
[2:29:52] <Saffry_Ruzin> You can press RB when on the map to see different levels, that'll be VERY useful later @patstaresat
[2:29:56] <choocheess> those or resident evil lasers
[2:30:02] <+tinytinykittycat> I've never talked to Avina in any playthrough
[2:30:14] <$StrawberryPantsu> gEt tHeSe iMmIgRaNtS OfF MuH CiTaDeL
[2:30:17] <FlyguyJP> Avina is great for Lore dumps
[2:30:20] <ExpressNode> Cita Dilf
[2:30:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> Bailey fixed that
[2:30:23] <dekkitout> You got better
[2:30:24] <%Blackleafx> No but shush
[2:30:27] <peachy996> @tinytinykittycat there's a funny line with Avina and Kasumi in ME2
[2:30:29] <TourettesPlays> in 2 the citadel is sort of a police state and in 3 it's a SUPER DUPER Police State
[2:30:33] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat, that was literally the first thing you got fixed when you came here in ME2
[2:30:37] <%captain_kirkhammer> What happened to the voice filter on that one line
[2:30:37] <stantheman_97> Bailey fixed it when you met
[2:30:38] <peachy996> Kasumi does the Reaper Fingerquotes
[2:30:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> Avina freaks me the fuck out
[2:30:42] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> You fixed it in ME2.
[2:30:43] <%QueequegTheater> Kappa
[2:30:44] <+Havictos> nah
[2:30:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> I think it wasx
[2:30:47] <$Faustgesicht> Shit now you gotta pay taxes
[2:30:47] <choocheess> I wonder how Earth is doing
[2:30:50] <secret_npc> Ha, yes
[2:30:52] <%NeoCre> Vault fixed it for you in 2
[2:30:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's in space, there's literally only ONE vista
[2:30:53] <%Blackleafx> ;)
[2:30:55] <dawarw0lf> Her model probably
[2:30:57] <FlyguyJP> Talk to the IGN woman. You must.
[2:31:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah they un-deaded you in 2 the first time you went on the Citadel
[2:31:08] <%NeoCre> Bailey fixed it in 2
[2:31:09] <peachy996> AHHHH there she is
[2:31:09] <+MrATheGreat> Gotta get yelled at by the boss before you can leave
[2:31:11] <GustauveVIII> ew no god

[2:31:34] <Alzero83> Why does Chobots face look busted??
[2:31:35] <blackjack8182> So Bad!
[2:31:36] <4DLuvOfLuthy> Boooo, Hissss
[2:31:37] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt At the very least chobot just hangs out in a side room she's inoffensive.
[2:31:37] <%LumberjackJack> Who is a game reviewer
[2:31:38] <%JamesCorck> Don't pick her up! You don't need her.
[2:31:39] <%MidnightBurst12> uh oh

[2:31:39] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> CHOBOT

[2:31:41] <$hattrick61> GET HER OOOOOUUUUUUUTTTTTAAAAAAA HERE
[2:31:42] <peachy996> Face Capture did her no justice
[2:31:42] <secret_npc> Allers is fine
[2:31:43] <KetsuoTaberu> Battletits
[2:31:43] <%radda343> you can romance her too iirc
[2:31:44] <KeystoneA2> THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN EMILY WONG DAMMIT
[2:31:44] <%GarbageNirvana> I think you can still run into her if you didn't imprison/kill her in 1
[2:31:45] <Reverend_Godshyne> chobot the robot
[2:31:47] <%QueequegTheater> BOOOOOO, HISSSSS
[2:31:48] <willyfreshness> they really botched her model
[2:31:48] <+even_the_yuenglings> JUSTICE FOR EMILY WONG
[2:31:49] <TheMostAverageGamer4> shes cool
[2:31:49] <SaltyAzteca> Chobot?
[2:31:49] <ExpressNode> I don't know the backstory on that
[2:31:49] <choocheess> She was named after a Manga
[2:31:50] <%sunsetdisc0> ah yes, the video games journalist which was added to the game for reasons which im sure had nothing to do with EA
[2:31:50] <blackjack8182> So dated
[2:31:51] <IntrepidEye> oh yeah......
[2:31:51] <+AmericanSkidd> she did not come out unscathed
[2:31:51] <+vilecrois> Still gonna punch her?
[2:31:51] <Mechazoic_Era> HIDEOUS model
[2:31:52] <+Tizona824> Ehhh

[2:31:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she has funny name
[2:31:53] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> SHES A PRE HISTORICAL FIGURE
[2:31:54] <+MrATheGreat> She was on g4 back in the day
[2:31:56] <+JerseyBleek> we'll bang ok
[2:31:57] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking SCI FI SNOOKIE
[2:31:57] <%bread_assassin> Pat....ALL of these people are played by real world people. Kappa
[2:31:58] <+Scevda> Tell her to fuck off
[2:31:59] <@commanderclaw> She looks waxy
[2:31:59] <%watts121> Where do you think Jessica Chobit's off button is?
[2:31:59] <%YakumoYomi> Yes, the face capture makes her look fucked up
[2:32:00] <triangularblasphemy> Poor lady
[2:32:01] <%MidnightBurst12> nope
[2:32:01] <Aiutare47> and they gave her a manikin's body and a weirdo melty face
[2:32:02] <%Ynkubus_> Was IGN and is now a ghost hunter on youtube i think?
[2:32:02] <Sp3ctre48> I'm sure she's a cool lady but this is awful and she looks so bad
[2:32:03] <Saffry_Ruzin> I always ignored her in all playthroughs
[2:32:04] <+akscully> face capture was terrible
[2:32:04] <+Birdigalore> Nah her face looks swollej
[2:32:05] <ToneBacas> agreed
[2:32:05] <%gliph13> it did not
[2:32:07] <SaltyAzteca> Wait who is she?
[2:32:08] <Laecerelius> Yeah her model is horrible
[2:32:08] <%GabeSweetMan> mm
[2:32:09] <Mattais88> yeah, it's not great
[2:32:09] <+flexin_apex> The psp licker
[2:32:10] <%Extrallent> isn't every character played by an actual person
[2:32:12] <4DLuvOfLuthy> It really didnt
[2:32:13] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Chobot is a very pretty lady but HO BOY DID THEY DO HER DIRTY
[2:32:13] <dawarw0lf> You can just leave her
[2:32:13] <secret_npc> Jessica Chobot is a normal good person, I bet getting put into ME3 was really cool
[2:32:14] <%Ipsenscastle> it was awful at the time
[2:32:17] <Marakami_Sadaneo> cirYep
[2:32:19] <+DracosMagala> No. It. Didn't
[2:32:19] <williamrooster> shes got bad potato head
[2:32:21] <%Aleate> BattleTits
[2:32:21] <IntrepidEye> aged like milk? it sucked at the time
[2:32:24] <%captain_kirkhammer> They fucking killed Emily Wong in a goddamn Twitter thread
[2:32:25] <%Blackleafx> Wong died on the way back to her home planet
[2:32:25] <+Havictos> @commanderclaw she looks puffy like allergy puffy
[2:32:26] <Draco_Renegade> They did Emily Wong so dirty.
[2:32:26] <AxelCezar> bitterShrug bitterShrug
[2:32:28] <FlyguyJP> Wong mistake
[2:32:28] <+unhuggable1> it was such a weird fuckin choice
[2:32:29] <DatAsuna> Jessica chobot went on to write some indie games
[2:32:29] <%AncelDeLambert> when I first played this game I legitimately thought they had brought in Snookie as a character because Jersey Shore was popular
[2:32:29] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> SHES A PRE HISTORIC PERSONALITY ON THE INTERNET
[2:32:29] <$hattrick61> Emily Wong killed on Twitter
[2:32:30] <+ComfortableStranger> PAT, that would take work
[2:32:30] <Sp3ctre48> Sorry Emily Wong died off screen
[2:32:31] <peachy996> Emily Wong is dead by the way
[2:32:32] <+tinytinykittycat> character model looks like shit and real lady looks nice
[2:32:32] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @SaltyAzteca she was on G4 back when it existed.
[2:32:34] <%Romuken> NYEH
[2:32:35] <falyden> butterface
[2:32:35] <+even_the_yuenglings> bruh
[2:32:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt They totalled Wong'd us
[2:32:36] <GustauveVIII> OH GOD THAT MODEL HOLY SHIT
[2:32:36] <peachy996> Oof
[2:32:36] <+unhuggable1> no one likes Diana
[2:32:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ugh
[2:32:36] <Mechazoic_Era> CHEEKS
[2:32:38] <%MidnightBurst12> jesus christ
[2:32:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Battle Tits
[2:32:38] <%watts121> Her body also looks rough
[2:32:38] <%Lion_kun> I had sex with her and my friend never lets me live it down. He says I had sex with a potato.
[2:32:39] <%count_bob> @IntrepidEye AND IT ONLY GOT WORSE.
[2:32:39] <blackjack8182> I miss Wong
[2:32:39] <stantheman_97> i don't even know who jessica chobot is
[2:32:40] <28moogles> Should have been Emily Wong, 100% agree. Diana is... inoffensive but doesn't add much.
[2:32:40] <%Rumbutt> Yeah Emily Wong was so cool
[2:32:41] <willyfreshness> Worstly they shove her on the Normandy
[2:32:41] <%GabeSweetMan> That is NOT Jessica.
[2:32:42] <akitanito> don't zoom into the face, STOP
[2:32:42] <%lloyddboy> HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[2:32:42] <+AmericanSkidd> plus she is barely anything in the game overall
[2:32:43] <iosephe> jesus christ that suit
[2:32:44] <HyperionXV> raysClerk
[2:32:44] <peachy996> Oh don't zoom in
[2:32:45] <olaksi> I played this game like 3 times and I still never remember this character exists
[2:32:45] <mr_saturday93> Has Jessica done anything recently?
[2:32:45] <Marakami_Sadaneo> BATTLE TITS
[2:32:46] <%JoshManVGH> whaaaaaaat the fuck!
[2:32:47] <Profmcstevie> Nice cheeks
[2:32:47] <FlyguyJP> Battletits

[2:32:49] <ExpressNode> Oh fuck
[2:32:49] <PanicSwytch> Oh god she looks bad
[2:32:49] <+DracosMagala> God her cheeks WutFace
[2:32:49] <+condemned_15> back when G4 had clout
[2:32:49] <Alzero83> EWWW KILL IT!
[2:32:49] <%Lizard0TM> you can see her nips
[2:32:49] <+wmeldrum> it's the animation, not the face
[2:32:49] <%LumberjackJack> DansGame
[2:32:50] <%sunsetdisc0> but the who would have died in the marketing leading up to the release???
[2:32:50] <choocheess> Im convinced her featuring in ME3 plunged Chobot into obscurity
[2:32:51] <+ComfortableStranger> we'll bang okay?
[2:32:51] <+OG_M_Bison> BATTLE TITS
[2:32:52] <%AncelDeLambert> HEY SNOOKIE TELL ME ABOUT THE PICKLES
[2:32:52] <DatAsuna> "We'll bang okay?"
[2:32:53] <%afronooch> hearing this normal is so weird for me
[2:32:54] <%bread_assassin> Emily Wong may have died offscreen, but at least she went out like a boss.
[2:32:54] <+unhuggable1> its just so out of place
[2:32:56] <%maskofmichael> She looks like a puffy Megan Fox
[2:32:56] <%Blackleafx> WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAACE
[2:32:58] <+even_the_yuenglings> NotLikeThis
[2:32:58] <%count_bob> BATTLE TITS.
[2:32:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> They kept her nips in I see
[2:32:58] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> WE BANG OK
[2:33:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ) 👄 (
[2:33:01] <tommyboy96> REPORT TO THE SHIP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
[2:33:02] <+Scevda> Fucking whore
[2:33:02] <$hattrick61> BEGONE, BOT
[2:33:02] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Christ, at least Bimbo Ashley is attractive
[2:33:02] <+condemned_15> We'll bang okay
[2:33:02] <KeystoneA2> Next up: drugs. I want that shit.
[2:33:03] <VentWilsn> wtf is that outfitm
[2:33:04] <+OG_M_Bison> Her voice acting is so bad too
[2:33:04] <blackjack8182> Emily Wong died on Twitter
[2:33:04] <+SilverDevilfish> God Bioware was really bad at putting real faces into the game
[2:33:05] <DatAsuna> Gamer poop enhanced this so much
[2:33:05] <+AmericanSkidd> we'll bang ok
[2:33:05] <+Birdigalore> Did she get stung by several bees?
[2:33:06] <%CalderGaming> not a voice actor
[2:33:06] <%AncelDeLambert> I HATE that this character just shows up on your ship
[2:33:07] <$realm_forge> Anyone remember G4tv?
[2:33:08] <olaksi> you can bond over how messed up your faces are
[2:33:08] <%Piemen99> Wow this shit is terrible
[2:33:09] <peachy996> I would rather have had Khalisa Ben Singan Al Jilani
[2:33:09] <secret_npc> Allers is from Bekenstein, same as Donovan Hock
[2:33:10] <%Ipsenscastle> that latex dress is so embarrassing
[2:33:11] <$StrawberryPantsu> BUT PATRICK YOU KNOW HER FACE AND VOICE!
[2:33:12] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Manslay3r ruined my brain
[2:33:12] <+MrATheGreat> Chobot now stars in Expedition X which premiered on February 12, 2020 on the Discovery Channel.
[2:33:13] <AxelCezar> good god that looks horrible
[2:33:13] <GustauveVIII> jesus no
[2:33:15] <%Lizard0TM> We'll Bang OK?
[2:33:17] <+AmericanSkidd> pls say no
[2:33:19] <+Kyma1020> HER NIPS ARE JUST POKING OUT AND IT'S WEIRD
[2:33:21] <%LumberjackJack> Her only purpose is to get a little extra war assets
[2:33:21] <%bravebravesrobin> include that ass
[2:33:21] <+vaderxyz1970> Manslaye1r has runned this scene forever
[2:33:25] <SaltyAzteca> @Ches_Neckbeard wow G4, thats a relic of the past. Kinda looks familiar now that you reminded me
[2:33:25] <peachy996> Khalisa actually supports your effort in this game
[2:33:26] <stantheman_97> that doesn't apply when your enemy doesn't care about publicity
[2:33:27] <TheMostAverageGamer4> she worked for nerdist for years but left like 2 years ago
[2:33:31] <doggieo> Those cheeks
[2:33:31] <%Ipsenscastle> it just doesn't make sense
[2:33:34] <%Romuken> 90% chance to punch her in the face
[2:33:36] <peachy996> So even Khalisa is on your side
[2:33:36] <FlyguyJP> It also smacks of WAY too much of reviewer/developer collusion
[2:33:37] <Laecerelius> We'll bang, okay?
[2:33:39] <+even_the_yuenglings> EXACTLY
[2:33:40] <%LumberjackJack> And you owe Emily Wong a favor, if you did the paragon influence
[2:33:40] <+wmeldrum> WHY WOULD YOU LET SOME RANDO ON YOUR SHIP
[2:33:42] <+AmericanSkidd> for real
[2:33:42] <secret_npc> HER ROMANCE IS SO AWKWARD AND DOESN'T IMPACT OTHER RELATIONSHIPS, IT'S FUNNY
[2:33:42] <%JoshManVGH> Fuck YEAH Emily, Welcome aboard! Have a gun!
[2:33:43] <KeystoneA2> @vaderxyz1970 "ruined" is an odd way of saying "improved"
[2:33:44] <%Blackleafx> NO BUT SHUT UP THO
[2:33:44] <dd44dostivei> emily wong wasn't really a talking head like allers, though
[2:33:46] <%Blackleafx> IGN LADY
[2:33:46] <Psyramics> and like, 80% of players have punched her in the face, so...
[2:33:46] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> just punch chobot
[2:33:48] <tanarath> AND HE OWES HER
[2:33:49] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They killed Emily offscreen IN A TWEET
[2:33:50] <+Getter404> Emily Wong died as part of the marketing campaign. In a Twitter Thread.
[2:33:50] <%captain_kirkhammer> @Romuken That's the other one
[2:33:51] <+OG_M_Bison> @PatStaresAt Shut up you're making too much sense
[2:33:52] <%QueequegTheater> A TWEET
[2:33:52] <ape_hawk> NO BUT THEN EA WOULDNT GET MONEY FROM IGN
[2:33:52] <JetpackMcQuack> no put her in
[2:33:53] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> GLASS CHOBOT
[2:33:53] <choocheess> her model makes her look like she has a thyroid issue
[2:33:53] <peachy996> They killed Wong off in Twitter
[2:33:53] <+akscully> ton of people that bought me3 never played the others
[2:33:57] <%MightyDuckShoes> BUT CHOBOT THO
[2:33:58] <+condemned_15> yeah but IGN tho
[2:33:59] <+Scevda> Wong would have been awesome
[2:33:59] <28moogles> guys, Emily Wong isn't the one you punch
[2:34:01] <+OG_M_Bison> WE'LL BANG OKAY
[2:34:01] <FlyguyJP> Report to the ship. We'll bang, ok.
[2:34:02] <%Romuken> ah mb
[2:34:02] <dekkitout> Pat, that makes sense though. So it can not be done/
[2:34:03] <+vaderxyz1970> Well bang ok
[2:34:03] <+even_the_yuenglings> or even the one you get to punch wouldve been better
[2:34:03] <%demiiluna> We'll bang okay
[2:34:03] <+Birdigalore> HE SAID THE LINE

[2:44:59] <%afronooch> some sidequests are time limited others are time locked btw
[2:44:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah, it's dead
[2:44:59] <scrumbotime> It's horseshit that in the megafuture they can't fix that leg anyway

[2:45:08] <%Shubreaker> been there
[2:45:10] <%NateyBeak> robot leg tho!
[2:45:11] <$realm_forge> MAKE MY LEG INTO A GUN BITCH
[2:45:12] <%Ranryu692> ME3's ambient dialogue is amazing
[2:45:13] <choocheess> @Buzzkill983 com'on it'll be good for the both of us!
[2:45:14] <%Lizard0TM> who even cares if its gotta go
[2:45:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> This whole game is filled with shit like that and I LOVE it
[2:45:15] <BlindGato> We're in the future, just give him a robot leg
[2:45:17] <%gliph13> good thing this is the future and we totaly have cyborg Implants

[2:45:22] <ErikFeral> just 3D print a new leg
[2:45:22] <Ravioli_Ronin> Mega future should be fixing Kaiden like two hours ago
[2:45:24] <Profmcstevie> We'll get you a cool reaper leg dude
[2:45:24] <+AmericanSkidd> but cyber leg
[2:45:28] <+even_the_yuenglings> theres tons of good npc dialogue
[2:45:29] <%watts121> @Dova573 "Sir...your insurance doesn't cover that."
[2:45:32] <%valstriam> I prescribe you with the choppies
[2:45:32] <+coldsama> He can get a future robo leg
[2:45:33] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt You should see Ashley's Bimbofication in ME3. She looks and acts like someone took a fetish fanfic to her
[2:45:37] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt it stays excellent
[2:45:38] <28moogles> Yeah it's almost like this game is good.
[2:45:38] <+MrATheGreat> No it's great
[2:45:38] <+D00msDayDan> big throbbing reaper leg
[2:45:38] <$realm_forge> Give him full auto knees
[2:45:40] <%LumberjackJack> Ambient dialogue in this game is the best in the franchise
[2:45:40] <Sp3ctre48> ME3 has a lot of good atmosphere
[2:45:41] <peachy996> Yeah the Ambient Dialogue is great
[2:45:41] <%QueequegTheater> Like 90% of the game is great
[2:45:41] <Ravioli_Ronin> Slap some Kolto on those orbital fractures and traumatic brain damage
[2:45:44] <KeystoneA2> game has a lot of faults but the ambient stuff is quite good
[2:45:44] <FlyguyJP> Atmopshere was pretty sick in ME3
[2:45:46] <secret_npc> Don't buy the fish VI, Pat, for the love of god
[2:45:52] <Sp3ctre48> Ashley's design sucks in this game
[2:45:53] <%Wurmspawn> It's great. And a few of the convos lead to sidequests.
[2:45:55] <Profmcstevie> The plot has ample opportunity to write fun stories now we're in BIG WAR
[2:45:56] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah if you keep coming back the ambient dialogue is like mini storylines
[2:45:58] <+vaderxyz1970> @watts121 What is this SPACE BCBS
[2:45:58] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I LOVE Bimbo Ash but I have a fetish
[2:45:58] <holyxgrale> Yea they have Chak loads of ambient dialogue in this
[2:45:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Kylie Jenner ass lips
[2:45:59] <%CalderGaming> me3 is a great journey to a hackjob ending
[2:46:00] <+AmericanSkidd> The make up is what urks me
[2:46:03] <+Havictos> @FlyguyJP Mass Effect is oddly low tech for a sci-fi setting it's mostly just stuff we have now but better
[2:46:04] <Ids560> like the people who say 3 is fine until the ending aren't right but there is a lot of pretty good stuff there
[2:46:05] <%JamesCorck> They straight up copied Sandra Bullock, for Ashley's re-design.
[2:46:05] <%LumberjackJack> Remember that name: Tiptree
[2:46:06] <%ahomeschooldropout> ME3 has the best ambient dialogue IMO
[2:46:06] <%NeoCre> Ambient dialogue has some of the best stories
[2:46:07] <%Lizard0TM> or just walk between rooms lmao
[2:46:08] <%gliph13> I like her hair, don't like her face
[2:46:10] <ape_hawk> HEY, LAURA BAILEY
[2:46:11] <+flexin_apex> It is more busy in this mass effect
[2:46:13] <%andrewofbob> My favourite ambient conversation  is the N7 Fury arguing with gacha-man
[2:46:14] <peachy996> Remember Tiptree
[2:46:23] <secret_npc> Laura Bailey sounds like Ashly Burch here
[2:46:25] <Ravioli_Ronin> Oh no dnmSadge dnmSadge dnmSadge dnmSadge dnmSadge
[2:46:27] <$Teh_Un> Do not give the Asari a gun
[2:46:27] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> VIOLA bailey
[2:46:30] <JdotSweapA> it tipped!! harharr
[2:46:31] <%JoshManVGH> If the ending is as bad as people say, I'm stsrting to see why they may have received it poorly. This has been a strong opening.
[2:46:32] <+even_the_yuenglings> tiptree huh? must me unimportant
[2:46:34] <DatAsuna> remember tiptree, yes
[2:46:39] <%Rain_Mage> Give her a squirtgun
[2:46:41] <%snugglepuggs> Tiptree was Joker’s homeworld
[2:46:44] <%gliph13> GUN is Good, Human is BAD
[2:46:46] <stormhawk9891> This is Laura
[2:46:47] <+wmeldrum> tamber?
[2:46:47] <DatAsuna> ashly burch has been hired to voice match ahsley on non union gigs before
[2:46:49] <SaltyAzteca> Laura Burch
[2:46:50] <ape_hawk> not all white women sound the same
[2:46:54] <JetpackMcQuack> there are 5 voice actors
[2:46:58] <DatAsuna> *to voice match laura
[2:47:00] <%IamGrapes> oooh, husks. husks are human
[2:47:01] <secret_npc> QUICKSAVE WITH SELECT
[2:47:04] <+Scevda> Laura better
[2:47:05] <pr0phetrahl> You have to leave the level
[2:47:06] <JdotSweapA> Ashley Bailey
[2:47:08] <%gliph13> she's what Matt Mercer is to Troy Baker.
[2:47:13] <DatAsuna> So she's literally been replacing laura when games go non-union
[2:47:15] <%Solid_Stro> Shepard’s hears all at the Citadel…
[2:47:18] <Vadrigar1994> Pretty sure that's Laura
[2:47:20] <KetsuoTaberu> FeelsBadMan
[2:47:21] <%QueequegTheater> @JetpackMcQuack Thank the voice actor union for that one
[2:47:24] <+AmericanSkidd> ...

[2:47:42] <DatAsuna> Fun fact: the real reason everyone got recast in resident evil is also union shit
[2:47:42] <JdotSweapA> least its not Michelle ruff again
[2:47:43] <FlyguyJP> I don't like where this is going....
[2:47:43] <+MrATheGreat> tbf Ashley Burch replaced Laura Bailey's role twice so you're not the only one who thinks that
[2:47:43] <Marakami_Sadaneo> man
[2:47:47] <Profmcstevie> Just biotic away the filth
[2:47:49] <dawarw0lf> Might want to walk away first to not ruin the beginning
[2:47:54] <DSD24> Imagine how shitty it would be to be called PTSD Solider
[2:48:00] <Mattais88> What! I didn't know that existed
[2:48:00] <DatAsuna> But pat, wouldn't quicksave be better if you had to shout QUICKSAVE out loud to your microsoft kinect?
[2:48:04] <%JoshManVGH> Uh oh...

[2:48:38] <%gliph13> i don't like wher this is gong
[2:48:44] <%Wurmspawn> Having looked it up on IMDB Laura Bailey does in fact voice the PTSD Asari.
[2:48:46] <@commanderclaw> No, worse
[2:48:48] <choocheess> how can you confuse it for someone you knew
[2:48:48] <%Blackleafx> :)

[2:48:57] <%Ranryu692> Banshee
[2:48:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> how do mistaken a lanky ass Banshee for a normal Asari
[2:48:58] <%bread_assassin> Why was an Ardak-yashi allowed to be a commando?
[2:48:59] <dawarw0lf> Man pat is listening to everything I say today. Good pat
[2:49:02] <secret_npc> Just inject the ardat yakshi

[2:49:15] <choocheess> humans are juiced

[2:49:21] <%JoshManVGH> Oh wait! They Husked the Ardat Yakshi! Fuuuuuck
[2:49:24] <%TheotherKristian> So it wasn't racism, it was PTSD!
[2:49:32] <+vilecrois> That's a motherfucker
[2:49:33] <%gliph13> BANSHEE's are legit the most horrifying of the reapers.
[2:49:37] <Ravioli_Ronin> PTSD SOLDIER
[2:49:40] <FlyguyJP> Well PTSD is in her name.
[2:49:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gib her therapy gun
[2:49:50] <KeystoneA2> Horror stories like this are happening while people on the Citadel are partying hard lol
[2:49:50] <DatAsuna> Reloading this all up front is kinda bad because the thing this is meant to link to is way later in the game
[2:49:51] <choocheess> @JoshManVGH :O
[2:49:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> man being a future soldier with high tech armor and guns and being caught without any of that, not a good situation
[2:49:54] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Specifically this is a Husked-Ardat Yakshi.
[2:49:58] <+Buzzkill983> Psych Consultant is like, Jesus
[2:50:00] <%weissguard> Neiara isn't an Ardat Yakshi, idk wtf chat is on about LUL
[2:50:01] <%andrewofbob> Reapers specifically go after ardakt-yashi for building husks
[2:50:15] <%Wurmspawn> Chat you're getting ahead of yourselves here. Stop "correcting" pat's assumptions. He hasn't played through the whole game.
[2:50:15] <%QueequegTheater> Marauder Shields PogChamp
[2:50:15] <Ravioli_Ronin> “That’s rough, buddy”

[2:50:39] <%NitronStreams> Dont fuck with Farmers
[2:50:41] <teebos> love farm girl
[2:50:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> Farm Girl was also only 15.
[2:50:42] <%Rumbutt> Make farm girl a SPECTRE
[2:50:44] <secret_npc> Fake Ardat Yakshi Husk
[2:50:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and a rusty spoon
[2:50:47] <Alzero83> why you doing this NotLikeThis
[2:50:52] <Profmcstevie> It could be a rad DLC
[2:50:53] <$realm_forge> AND HER NAME IS JOHN CENA
[2:50:55] <%QueequegTheater> @Lancaster_H BibleThump 7
[2:50:57] <+condemned_15> give em the stick DONT GIVE EM THE STICK
[2:51:01] <KeystoneA2> Mass Effect could've had so many in-universe spinoffs
[2:51:02] <SaltyAzteca> WITH A FUCKIN PENCIL
[2:51:02] <Ravioli_Ronin> Like everything but the main story is pretty good tbh
[2:51:06] <+Scevda> Yep
[2:51:07] <atema128> Farm Girl sounds badass.
[2:51:09] <%gliph13> MASS EFFECT Survival Horror
[2:51:10] <+toastybites> @weissguard its implied she was aka her "medical condition"
[2:51:12] <+Havictos> @weissguard Yes she is all banshees are ardat yakshi
[2:51:13] <+SilverDevilfish> limesGun
[2:51:14] <FlyguyJP> It's a TRAP
[2:51:18] <+skyheys> why cant we play this game instead???
[2:51:23] <CrimsonFox777> So it's not just suicidal thoughts that makes her more comfortable with a gun then.
[2:51:23] <secret_npc> We'll remind Pat when the thing gets brought up
[2:51:26] <+even_the_yuenglings> a comic of this would be cool
[2:51:28] <Ravioli_Ronin> It’s kinda Soma
[2:51:29] <Marakami_Sadaneo> christ
[2:51:29] <+AmericanSkidd> dude i missed this when i played this is crazy
[2:51:30] <%capnbeefs> i wanna play that game
[2:51:32] <peachy996> This is a good way to max this dialogue out
[2:51:32] <+vaderxyz1970> Big Galaxy
[2:51:35] <%LumberjackJack> Oooooooooor... an Asari banshee
[2:51:37] <dawarw0lf> @ravioli_ronin Except that half that is good
[2:51:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> kind of intended to see these over time as you visit the location, but uh, yeah
[2:51:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Imagine if farm girl had a sword: Top tier.
[2:51:41] <%Ranryu692> yeah Samara was kind of stupid, considering there are more Ardat-Yakshi in the monastery WITH her daughters
[2:51:41] <ThatGuyThere03> there's an entire sactuary full of them
[2:51:41] <GuyverTypeL> Many more
[2:51:43] <SovPho> So this is Pat's first time with ME3?
[2:51:43] <Ids560> like this is good stuff, but this does seem tedious
[2:51:45] <+tinytinykittycat> bunches
[2:51:50] <%snugglepuggs> NO
[2:51:50] <+Scevda> Yep
[2:51:51] <secret_npc> I thought the Reapers just made into a Yakshi equivalent, but in husk form
[2:51:56] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> SHEPARD IS HEARING
[2:51:57] <%QueequegTheater> @LumberjackJack Banshees are explicitly ONLY Ardat-Yakshi
[2:52:04] <choocheess> are all asari biotic?
[2:52:04] <+AmericanSkidd> had to be done
[2:52:05] <Mattais88> It's more like these are genetic carriers. nt there quite, but the wrong spouse and boom
[2:52:09] <peachy996> @aWanderingKaivo yeah but revisiting Huerta can be a chore. I like it better this way for the stream
[2:52:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> monkaS
[2:52:13] <%QueequegTheater> Oof
[2:52:13] <+even_the_yuenglings> RIP AND TEAR
[2:52:16] <%snugglepuggs> it’s just people with potential in their ressesive genes
[2:52:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> Misattribution of arousal is pretty common
[2:52:18] <FlyguyJP> Yeah Shepard is just super shoving himself into this super personal conversation
[2:52:19] <SaltyAzteca> BERSERK
[2:52:20] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Asari Doom
[2:52:20] <+dustyjordans> @choocheess yes, asari are naturally biotic
[2:52:22] <+Havictos> @choocheess yes
[2:52:23] <+Bigbossman91> @LumberjackJack Banshees can only be created from Ardat Yakshis
[2:52:26] <P1PressStart> In ME2 Samara says she only knows of three ardat-yakshi but that it is possible more exist without the knowledge of the Asari government
[2:52:26] <%Deft_Thought> Why are they just having this discussion out in the open
[2:52:28] <Mattais88> like 3 i thinl
[2:52:29] <%aWanderingKaivo> @peachy996 yeah plus this one is kind of long actually
[2:52:33] <holyxgrale> You might be able to check in on lost leg man as well
[2:52:34] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @choocheess yes. it's just a matter of how much they train
[2:52:40] <+AmericanSkidd> oh no
[2:52:42] <+Scevda> 2
[2:52:45] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> you cant be hearing this
[2:52:56] <stantheman_97> it's really fucked that shepard is just watching her tell this story
[2:52:58] <AxelCezar> she just saw humans like we do to batarians
[2:53:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Deft_Thought There's probably no free spaces that aren't filled by wounded soldiers
[2:53:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Deft_Thought probably because its in the middle of a galactic crisis and space at hospitals is hard to come by
[2:53:03] <+RelikaNox> Oh no
[2:53:04] <+unhuggable1> uh oh
[2:53:04] <%LumberjackJack> BibleThump

[2:53:32] <+even_the_yuenglings> OH GOOD A MEDAL
[2:53:36] <VentWilsn> IM ON THE EDGE OF MY FUCKING SEAT
[2:53:36] <SovPho> Yeah, this game is good it just has a dogshit ending
[2:53:42] <%JamesCorck> I'm glad you're enjoying the game so far.
[2:53:43] <+Scevda> @jdotsweapa lol
[2:53:45] <+D00msDayDan> Reminds me of drebin’s stories in mgs4
[2:53:48] <%andrewofbob> Confirmed dead children: 2
[2:53:52] <choocheess> man things really escalated from ME2
[2:53:52] <tanarath> Yeah ME 3 combines the best of me1 & 2,then builds on it.
[2:53:53] <+Allyofwar> Mass Effect 3 is a genuinely good game, its just that the last 10 minutes almost game of throned the series.
[2:53:54] <peachy996> She doesn't want a medal just a gun.
[2:54:00] <%ahomeschooldropout> The Ardak-Yashi had information that could lead to the arrest of the  Cl-
[2:54:01] <rytisone> It's almost like it just needed more development time
[2:54:02] <+AmericanSkidd> fuck
[2:54:03] <+MrATheGreat> NO
[2:54:05] <%weissguard> Almost like people have embellished how bad the game is overall, instead of emphasizing the problem is the ending.
[2:54:07] <+MrATheGreat> NO GUN FOR YOU
[2:54:09] <tanarath> Shames about the rushed dev.
[2:54:10] <+even_the_yuenglings> dont let her near a gun
[2:54:11] <$Teh_Un> Do NOT give the Asari a gun
[2:54:11] <DatAsuna> do not give her the gun
[2:54:12] <stantheman_97> well...
[2:54:12] <GustauveVIII> thats enough
[2:54:14] <+Havictos> give her a nerf gun
[2:54:14] <%QueequegTheater> NOPE
[2:54:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> The answer to that question is FUCKING no
[2:54:17] <%greasypete00> youd usually say no
[2:54:19] <+akscully> do not give them a gun
[2:54:19] <+Buzzkill983> Never give them the gun
[2:54:19] <%LumberjackJack> One more?
[2:54:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:54:21] <%QueequegTheater> NOT FOR YOU, MA'AM
[2:54:23] <+akscully> it's not
[2:54:24] <%Blackleafx> DO NOT
[2:54:25] <$Faustgesicht> Placatation
[2:54:25] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @weissguard Hey no shut up
[2:54:25] <%NitronStreams> Hide ALL THE GUNS
[2:54:25] <%GabeSweetMan> No rope either.
[2:54:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> She gonna kill herself
[2:54:26] <ErikFeral> DO NOT give them a GUN
[2:54:26] <CrimsonFox777> The gun is more of a safety blanket than a means out for her.
[2:54:27] <%CalderGaming> that was therapist speak for "now but I don'
[2:54:27] <SaltyAzteca> Guilt
[2:54:28] <%shadowace2400> she's not gonna give her a gun
[2:54:28] <@commanderclaw> Different reason, same answer
[2:54:30] <Sp3ctre48> I find of a lot of ME3 pretty mediocre outside of the ending but these background storylines were always very good
[2:54:30] <%CalderGaming> t want to upset you"
[2:54:31] <+MrATheGreat> Give her a nerf blaster
[2:54:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Giver a gun, don't tell her it's empty
[2:54:33] <%gliph13> COMPLICATED
[2:54:33] <+Scevda> The end!
[2:54:33] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt go to the embassies, and look out the railing at the end of the hallway
[2:54:34] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @weissguard game bad
[2:54:34] <+vaderxyz1970> GIVE HER A SWORD
[2:54:34] <Profmcstevie> Give her an airsoft gun
[2:54:35] <%andrewofbob> And don't give Dick Mullen a gun either
[2:54:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> not a loaded one
[2:54:37] <%CalderGaming> *no
[2:54:39] <faiz_saad> ariW WHY
[2:54:39] <%PineapplePlatypus> Farm girl is Jokers sister i think
[2:54:40] <SovPho> do you think that's moral injury or ptsd
[2:54:40] <+akscully> no, not that either
[2:54:41] <+Scevda> Or is it?
[2:54:42] <%king_wragles> Unloaded AND disabled
[2:54:42] <DatAsuna> exactly what you think happens if you give her a gun
[2:54:43] <good_gremlin_sr> cool motive, still ptsd with a gun
[2:54:45] <+Zpaztic> Things get so much worse once you figure out who its implied that Asari killed.
[2:54:46] <ThatGuyThere03> I'd give her a plastic prop gun
[2:54:46] <+kortin> It's kinda annoying that you had to reload it repeatedly to listen to it, though
[2:54:46] <FlyguyJP> Creeper Shepard
[2:54:47] <peachy996> We'll remind you of Tiptree much later in your playthrough if you don't remember..
[2:54:49] <+critikal_bit> It's Nerf or nothing!
[2:54:49] <choocheess> hahaha it sounded like the welcome commander shepherd was responding to your hello darling
[2:54:52] <+StrikeTheErf> "listen ma'am, it's Nerf or Nothing"
[2:54:53] <$Faustgesicht> Unloaded, missing the firing mechanism
[2:54:56] <%king_wragles> Actually, wood gun

[2:56:55] <+Zpaztic> As far as memory serves that's not something most people would notice by themselves unless pointed out. Still shouldn't spoil stuff.
[2:56:59] <dd44dostivei> fuck that guy
[2:57:00] <%BlackStarAura> Fucking children
[2:57:00] <+twohitgood> it's like they gotta let out spoilers like someone's gotta take a shit. probably means they can't be trusted with secrets, either.
[2:57:01] <karl_rex> Imagine being a what a fucker to spoil  this
[2:57:03] <$LightningLynx89> Guys remember Pat hasn’t played more than 90 minutes of the game
[2:57:05] <JetpackMcQuack> We using disco as a metaphor now? LUL
[2:57:05] <%zeroarturia> Actually does Shepherd have his fish buddies too?
[2:57:05] <good_gremlin_sr> spoilers are now disco elysiums
[2:57:09] <+AmericanSkidd> yeah you were way closer to the water
[2:57:11] <%TheotherKristian> Poor Woolie, though, them gosh darn spoilers
[2:57:12] <%Lizard0TM> there was actually 2 people
[2:57:12] <%gliph13> well at least it wasn't a Main story spoiler
[2:57:14] <+toastybites> @artoflec someone spoiled a major part of the ending for Woolie
[2:57:16] <peachy996> Couldn't even dance around the subject just had to spoil the whole thing
[2:57:17] <28moogles> Last time you were here it was bombed by Sovereign, no?
[2:57:18] <Meekest> That guy, later: "I've been a sub for so long, I'm a huge fan, I'm so sorry"
[2:57:20] <DianaTheAscian> Man I can't believe someone ruined that part for Wooile
[2:57:24] <%aWanderingKaivo> volus bros
[2:57:25] <%GarbageNirvana> If we have not or are not currently seeing it happen on screen in front of our eyes right now, SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT IT
[2:57:26] <%Lizard0TM> psa2guy psa2guy
[2:57:29] <Sp3ctre48> I forgot the crackheaded way sidequests work in this game
[2:57:30] <%GalacticaPhanto> So dumb question, without spoiling it if it's a big deal, by this point are Keepers a thing still?
[2:57:30] <%LumberjackJack> Oh, look, a fetch quest. 80% of the game.
[2:57:32] <%GarbageNirvana> That simple
[2:57:33] <$LightningLynx89> I know you all Wanna tell Pat about all the cool shit. But please remember Pat has not seen much
[2:57:35] <+Birdigalore> This Volus has the smoothest voice
[2:57:36] <ape_hawk> a volus that doesnt sound like a nerd!
[2:57:37] <+AmericanSkidd> side mission
[2:57:37] <+MrATheGreat> Btw FUCK SPOIL PEOPLE
[2:57:37] <Laecerelius> Our alien Pat bros!
[2:57:38] <good_gremlin_sr> @gliph13 tats the one part he already kinda sorta knows so this is worse
[2:57:38] <artoflec> @toastybites that fucking sucks, for how long they've been at it with that game. I'm glad that didnt happen with 13 sentinels
[2:57:38] <rytisone> codex
[2:57:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Meekest it's only a week long timeout, not a ban
[2:57:41] <choocheess> that's got the most charismatic volus voice
[2:57:41] <murdocismyhero> What about the crab people
[2:57:43] <+Scevda> @28moogles 2.8 years ago
[2:57:44] <%LumberjackJack> 80% of side quests, sorry
[2:57:44] <peachy996> THESE SUCK, But I want you to do them on stream
[2:57:47] <FlyguyJP> Oh right. Sidequests just work by Shepard just showing up "Hey I eavedropped on you and heard you needed thing. Here is thing."
[2:57:49] <+AmericanSkidd> a fetch quest of sorts
[2:57:49] <%Wurmspawn> Certain side missions you get from these convos won't be doable till later chapters of the game. So don't stress too much.
[2:57:49] <peachy996> Feel my pain
[2:57:54] <+polothegreatest> woolie disco then ruined? DansGame PJSalt
[2:57:55] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You will get a metric ass ton of random side quests that are locked behind story progress, dont worry about them
[2:57:59] <%SABiscotti> Priority missions move things forward, do them last (generally)
[2:58:02] <%Ranryu692> you still do
[2:58:03] <blackjack8182> Abysmal side quests!
[2:58:06] <DatAsuna> yeah you do, just not the shitty sidequests
[2:58:06] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm also not thrilled, I have played ME1 and 2 but NOT 3 so this is all fresh for me too.
[2:58:06] <%Lizard0TM> you still can
[2:58:08] <28moogles> @Scevda That was the last time though, this is rebuilt, that's why it's different.
[2:58:09] <+tinytinykittycat> half your sidequiests are just overhearing stuff on the citadel
[2:58:10] <+AmericanSkidd> oh this one though
[2:58:12] <+MrATheGreat> Son's dead ma'am NEXT
[2:58:13] <dawarw0lf> This is a reminder to SHUT UP ABOUT THE CITADEL DLC. LET HIM EXPERIENCE YOUR T
[2:58:14] <%Lizard0TM> but sometimes you can overhear sidequest
[2:58:17] <williamrooster> @GalacticaPhanto keepers are needed to maintain the station
[2:58:18] <GuyverTypeL> VOLUSSSS YEYEYE
[2:58:18] <tanarath> Oh no
[2:58:19] <%Ranryu692> this is my favorite ambient dialogue
[2:58:20] <%LumberjackJack> Oooof
[2:58:20] <+RyanTheRecluse> BibleThump
[2:58:21] <Ralyks9117> inoperative knows who the farm girl in the story is.
[2:58:23] <%QueequegTheater> Uh oh
[2:58:26] <stantheman_97> maaaaaaaan
[2:58:27] <DatAsuna> there's proper side quests, and then the "tertiary" quests basically
[2:58:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh god
[2:58:32] <+AmericanSkidd> sadness
[2:58:33] <+akscully> hope you like thinking about aging parents!
[2:58:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> too fuckin real
[2:58:37] <%afronooch> side quests will either have to be done before a certain mission, or cant be done until after a certain mission
[2:58:37] <+Chaos_Aether> maam he is dead
[2:58:38] <DatAsuna> and all this stuff is the lower tier tertiary stuff
[2:58:38] <Laecerelius> This can't end well
[2:58:45] <%QueequegTheater> @Ralyks9117 Dude, shut up
[2:58:46] <Profmcstevie> War time is such a good place to write tragedy
[2:58:46] <+AmericanSkidd> I feel for this asari
[2:58:48] <28moogles> YEP
[2:58:49] <+vilecrois> Don't tell me that bullshit is still a thing in the future c'mon

[2:58:55] <SaltyAzteca> I think I remember this one. This one hurts
[2:58:57] <%DrTomT18> one thing I really like with the Citidel in 3 is that it gets more and more crowded
[2:58:58] <tanarath> R i p
[2:58:59] <choocheess> it's not like him to get killed
[2:59:03] <holyxgrale> FeelsBadMan

[2:59:05] <+kastev> In other news, war SUCKS
[2:59:06] <Sp3ctre48> Like I wish THESE were the sidequests cause they're deadass some of the best writing in the game

[2:59:14] <$Mekhet09> These small moments are the only good thing about ME3.
[2:59:14] <+Scevda> @28moogles you give it too much credit. Its because they made this hub area this small.
[2:59:14] <%Ranryu692> this one is so rough
[2:59:15] <Mattais88> Another one/
[2:59:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> I live in a military town, I've had a customer come into my store and do this, her family told me and it was awkward and sucks man

[3:00:32] <+codgerleggings> that is totally doc mitchell
[3:00:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> I think the funniest thing about the Ashley stuff is that because of the make up and stuff she still has it on in the hspital

[3:01:00] <KeystoneA2> again
[3:01:01] <DianaTheAscian> damn
[3:01:03] <%GalacticaPhanto> Why is she mad at you? like wasn't it public knowledge that Shep was in the clink?
[3:01:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Wait, I thought you picked Anderson as your council member.
[3:01:06] <+Birdigalore> He can smell the cirruption on you.  It gives him a boner
[3:01:16] <%QueequegTheater> @Sigma_190_Beta doesn't matter
[3:01:17] <holyxgrale> FeelsBadMan
[3:01:19] <choocheess> man this is sad
[3:01:20] <+AmericanSkidd> you can see it from here
[3:01:22] <%afronooch> yep
[3:01:23] <PraiseHemra> I can only hear tne gamer poop version
[3:01:24] <%sunsetdisc0> cjoices matter!
[3:01:24] <%count_bob> @Sigma_190_Beta Anderson resigned.
[3:01:26] <%miguelrod777> yup
[3:01:26] <nivlac_555> wtf
[3:01:27] <Marakami_Sadaneo> that stupid
[3:01:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> @GalacticaPhanto she just has it in for Sheperd because protagonist
[3:01:29] <secret_npc> Anderson is a shit council member
[3:01:29] <omniv_of_g0r> Yup
[3:01:30] <akitanito> anderson gets bored
[3:01:30] <BlockingDisabled> Same...
[3:01:31] <28moogles> Anderson steps down to be war man
[3:01:32] <Mattais88> It happens in a book I think
[3:01:32] <FassieFons> udina is inevitable
[3:01:32] <%Rumbutt> Anderson always quits
[3:01:34] <%LumberjackJack> They try to explain it in Anderson and Udina's codex but eeeeeeeh
[3:01:35] <P1PressStart> Anderson hated being councilor too much
[3:01:35] <4DLuvOfLuthy> yea he does
[3:01:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GalacticaPhanto the invasion started during his trial, they should
[3:01:36] <robosqueeb> yeah cus anderson is busy saving erff
[3:01:38] <medoodoo> who are you romancing for this game pat/
[3:01:39] <+OneGorillionDollars> I love bailey's character
[3:01:39] <omniv_of_g0r> Thanks to a book
[3:01:39] <%NitronStreams> Anderson is a little busy
[3:01:40] <KeystoneA2> Anderson says "fuck it" and quits so he can be an Admiral between 2's end and 3's start
[3:01:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> @QueequegTheater Huh, I guess I forget more than I thought about Mass Effect 3.
[3:01:41] <+tinytinykittycat> ya
[3:01:42] <%Eaglestrike117> Yeah, in ME3 Anderson decides "FUCK IT" and stays on earth to be a badass
[3:01:43] <Sp3ctre48> Something Something your choices mattered
[3:01:45] <%Wurmspawn> Yes. Udina ends up in his current postion no matter that decision.
[3:01:46] <+Scevda> Anderson is a military man!
[3:01:47] <%kastev> kastev subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:01:48] <%gliph13> but BioWare's like FUCK YOU, UDINA THO
[3:01:49] <+codgerleggings> Yeah Michael Hogan. doc mitchell. cool guy
[3:01:51] <secret_npc> Just pick Udina in ME1, tbh
[3:01:54] <choocheess> what's the point of picking anderson?
[3:01:59] <%GalacticaPhanto> @goose_attack_almanac Yeah sounds like a "hard news" journalist
[3:02:05] <Sp3ctre48> There's no point
[3:02:10] <%Lizard0TM> @choocheess paragon points
[3:02:13] <%GabeSweetMan> The best strategy for the war effort is the Zap Brannigan Technique! You see, the Reapers have a set kill limit, so if you simply send wave after wave of your own men at them, they'll eventually hit their limit and shut down!
[3:02:13] <%JoshManVGH> wouldn't that be a political shitstorm? First Human council member and you're like "fuck it I'm out!"
[3:02:14] <+Bigbossman91> @choocheess to fuck over Udina
[3:02:18] <%Tearonex> Is that Doc Murphy from New Vegas!?
[3:02:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> @choocheess pissing off Udina
[3:02:22] <akitanito> so you have a "your choice matters!" for one game
[3:02:23] <secret_npc> Picking Anderson = babby Paragon
[3:02:23] <%Eaglestrike117> isnt the point of picking Anderson getting specture back?
[3:02:30] <%Axellogic> Doc mitchell when will we get to new vegas
[3:02:34] <secret_npc> BITS OF LEAD OUT
[3:02:34] <FlyguyJP> How does the keyboard not freakout whem you shove your entire arm through it
[3:02:36] <+codgerleggings> yeah it is tearonex
[3:02:37] <+Kingtut9009> I never noticed but that's the Doc's voice actor from New Vegas @PatStaresAt
[3:02:39] <+Scevda> @gabesweetman just about done at the end
[3:02:44] <%gliph13> @secret_npc I refuse to give that man ANY Benfits, even if it delays the inevitable
[3:02:44] <choocheess> he's become an even bigger shit around here
[3:02:50] <%Tearonex> @Axellogic thatk you thought it was murphy
[3:02:55] <%Rumbutt> that seems fucking shady
[3:02:56] <%LumberjackJack> THAT SOUNDS IMPORTANT
[3:02:58] <DSD24> This sounds dire
[3:02:58] <+MrATheGreat> DEAD
[3:02:59] <+Ches_Neckbeard> STOP RESISTING
[3:03:00] <peachy996> Yeah that's from a Comic I think
[3:03:01] <%NitronStreams> ...
[3:03:01] <+Chaos_Aether> @PatStaresAt how much time has pass since ME1?
[3:03:01] <+AmericanSkidd> what book was this?
[3:03:02] <P1PressStart> Honestly I just say Udina for councilor just because I feel bad for giving Anderson a job he loathes
[3:03:02] <%JoshManVGH> Uhhhhhh.....
[3:03:03] <Dunmarkh> that's fucked
[3:03:04] <blue8moon> hmm

[3:04:11] <+AmericanSkidd> its rough
[3:04:15] <%logoth_> Yes Reapers would make Canada a high value target
[3:04:16] <+vilecrois> what if it were just french canada tho

[3:05:00] <DatAsuna> quarians arming up
[3:05:01] <$realm_forge> @patstaresat The specter terminal is your best friend if you miss side quest items
[3:05:02] <P1PressStart> One thing ME3 did really well was the general "background" conversations really selling how fucked up the war feels.
[3:05:03] <choocheess> float'illa
[3:05:06] <%Taisuru> Specterminal
[3:05:06] <%Blackleafx> DONT
[3:05:06] <%James_Quivers> This game does an excellent of job of selling the scope and horror of this war, an aura of depression is always present
[3:05:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> god I love Quarians
[3:05:11] <$Teh_Un> No gun
[3:05:11] <Sp3ctre48> Shocking news the Quarians may be about to do something really stupid
[3:05:11] <FlyguyJP> Quarians going full Lerroy
[3:05:17] <+AmericanSkidd> Mass... whats the opposite of an exodus?
[3:05:19] <peachy996> Give PTSD Asari a Gun? That's your choice now

[3:05:31] <DatAsuna> You know what will happen
[3:05:31] <blue8moon> I feel like that's a bad idea
[3:05:32] <+critikal_bit> That is a BAD idea
[3:05:32] <robosqueeb> DO IT
[3:05:33] <williamrooster> Floatillidie
[3:05:33] <teebos> NOOO
[3:05:33] <+ThomasOfTroy> Why is that even on the Spectre terminal
[3:05:34] <+MrATheGreat> So yeah what it is is that you over hear stuff and you make decisions on those matyters
[3:05:34] <Dunmarkh> DO IT
[3:05:34] <%afronooch> DO IT
[3:05:35] <%Blackleafx> Phew
[3:05:35] <DSD24> That's a dumb idea
[3:05:35] <peachy996> Up to you, I don't remember
[3:05:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> UM
[3:05:36] <%Romuken> LIKE A TOY GUN
[3:05:36] <%andrewofbob> Some of these choices lose galactic readiness
[3:05:36] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[3:05:37] <+Ches_Neckbeard> RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS
[3:05:37] <+DracosMagala> Do It
[3:05:37] <iosephe> That seems real questionable
[3:05:37] <xcompleasedad> GIVE HER A GUN
[3:05:38] <+OneGorillionDollars> YEYEYE
[3:05:38] <+condemned_15> NO

[3:05:40] <%LumberjackJack> YEYEYEYEYEYE GUNS GUNS GUNS
[3:05:42] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt BUY THE TYPHOON; BEST GUN FOR TEAMMATES, ESPECIALLY GARRUS when you have the money.
[3:05:42] <dawarw0lf> @james_quivers The fact that I was told otherwise last stream.
[3:05:44] <peachy996> LOOK AT DA GUNNSS
[3:05:44] <Laecerelius> Super power guns!

[3:05:47] <+Buzzkill983> Just because you can, doesn't mean you should lmao
[3:05:48] <xcompleasedad> Good idea
[3:05:48] <stantheman_97> GIVE THE PTSD VICTIM A GUN
[3:05:48] <P1PressStart> Look at all this DLC!
[3:05:49] <+RahuHordika> BUT IT'S SO GOOD THO
[3:05:49] <ErikFeral> Big NO
[3:05:51] <dekkitout> Guns!
[3:05:51] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Even for Renegade authorizing that request is an objective loss of assets
[3:05:52] <peachy996> GUNS GUNS GUNS
[3:05:52] <KeystoneA2> The Cerberus Harrier is the pussy destroyers
[3:05:53] <stormhawk9891> LOOK AT ALL THIS DLC
[3:05:57] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt The best SMG in the game is the N7 Hurricane, which is a DLC weapon
[3:05:57] <%andrewofbob> Crusader
[3:05:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> BEHEMOTH TYPHOON
[3:05:58] <+vilecrois> I mean she's still pretty dangerous with just her Biotics, no?
[3:06:00] <%Lizard0TM> CHEAT
[3:06:00] <%LumberjackJack> Most of those guns are the best guns in the game Kreygasm
[3:06:00] <akitanito> just give her a nerf gun
[3:06:01] <+Thedoobiousone> typhoon on garrus is amazing
[3:06:02] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Cerberus Harrier is the shit.
[3:06:03] <%DrTomT18> Love the Defender Armor, hate the helmet
[3:06:03] <AxelCezar> ALLWAYS GUN
[3:06:03] <choocheess> downloard money!
[3:06:04] <DatAsuna> You know EXACTLY what will happen
[3:06:05] <%Aleate> All those guns are like the BEST weapons in the Multiplayer tfuGasm
[3:06:06] <+vaderxyz1970> Im pretty sure youd get a pass cuz of all the money from 1 and 2
[3:06:07] <%afronooch> NO GIVE T'GONI the T'GUNI
[3:06:10] <DatAsuna> there's no need to do it
[3:06:10] <peachy996> This is good for testing out diff guns
[3:06:10] <%Hemmy99> DLC guns
[3:06:11] <+Ches_Neckbeard> respect her space 2nd amendment rights!
[3:06:13] <+Scevda> They put all the dlc in there?
[3:06:13] <%Blackleafx> psaDogchamp Father!
[3:06:14] <%rockcentuar> You will need to cheat
[3:06:15] <+MrATheGreat> MOD UP
[3:06:17] <+OneGorillionDollars> TYPHOON GOD GARRUS
[3:06:17] <SovPho> you're my favorite customer
[3:06:17] <$Faustgesicht> For real, check out those weapon descriptions
[3:06:19] <%DrTomT18> You need to go buy better guns, Pat
[3:06:21] <+polothegreatest> maybe next stream LUL
[3:06:23] <%rockcentuar> YOU HAVE TO CHEAT
[3:06:23] <blackjack8182> Cerberus Harrier is op
[3:06:25] <+Scevda> That sucks, they were free
[3:06:28] <+AmericanSkidd> You'd think there would be one on the Normandy
[3:06:32] <%rockcentuar> NOT ENOUGHT MONEY IN THE GAME
[3:06:33] <peachy996> There's no need to do it but it's nice to have. Test out what you like and don't like
[3:06:36] <DatAsuna> You can get weight reducing mods too
[3:06:37] <%Hemmy99> You used to get all those guns right off the bat. Bummer
[3:06:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Black Widow fucks. The gun not the movie. The movie is midling
[3:06:40] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt The Typhoon is the best gun for teammates in the game.
[3:06:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I never found the Typhoon on my MP save. Every other N7 weapon was almost maxed and still hadn't gotten it
[3:06:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> the shooting room in 3 is such a nice feature, like a training room in an action game. test out your guns, powers, compare damage..
[3:06:44] <Laecerelius> Yeah
[3:06:46] <%cha0tic_klutch> cha0tic_klutch subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 24 month streak! Much love and good wishes to you and yours sir
[3:06:46] <%QueequegTheater> NOT OPTIMAL REEEEE
[3:06:52] <holyxgrale> Wait wtf only 5%
[3:06:53] <%kastev> BUT PAT 5%
[3:06:55] <holyxgrale> It's a shotgun
[3:06:55] <%andrewofbob> Shredder mod - guardian shields don't exist anymore
[3:06:56] <stormhawk9891> Just try all guns, cuz shooting in this game feels GOOD
[3:06:58] <$realm_forge> The ARs in this game are really fun
[3:06:59] <%watts121> Yea if you call that living...living at 5% disadvantage
[3:07:00] <choocheess> do you want a little tube on your shotgun?! CoolCat
[3:07:00] <%somekindofsam> BUT IT'S NOT 200
[3:07:03] <rytisone> Assemble
[3:07:03] <Aiutare47> harrier is one of the best guns in the series IMO, and giving the typhoon to a squadmate with armor piercing makes most fights easy as shit
[3:07:04] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> WOOOOOOOOW
[3:07:04] <+AmericanSkidd> a pew pew
[3:07:06] <+Scevda> Solid
[3:07:07] <Laecerelius> true
[3:07:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Did he get the shotgun upgrade on the skill tree?
[3:07:15] <%DrTomT18> shot gun, assult rifle. Can't go wrong
[3:07:16] <williamrooster> you can get mods to make weapons lighter
[3:07:17] <%Aleate> There is a light sniper too that you can get that is great for that
[3:07:17] <%Mr_Pylon> yeah right in the dick
[3:07:18] <%capnbeefs> Use the vindicator
[3:07:19] <Profmcstevie> Dick shots
[3:07:20] <artoflec> why is it on the dick
[3:07:21] <+D00msDayDan> right in the dick
[3:07:21] <%kastev> Why are the targets in the dick
[3:07:22] <+MrATheGreat> And this is the problem with this system. Always ALWAYS have the assaulkt rifle
[3:07:22] <%Lizard0TM> vindicator is better?
[3:07:22] <Profmcstevie> dick shots for all
[3:07:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> shoot the dick
[3:07:24] <secret_npc> it is very, very, very, very, very, very easy to run out of money in this game, Pat, save and spend wisely
[3:07:24] <%lloyddboy> why not snipe?
[3:07:26] <dekkitout> Work on your dick shot grouping Shep
[3:07:26] <+Scevda> You were doing better with the vindicator
[3:07:32] <Laecerelius> Dick shots only
[3:07:33] <%andrewofbob> Mantis is pretty light
[3:07:33] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> YOU SHOULD had been the soldier
[3:07:34] <satiresatyr> we can go guns a-blazing?!
[3:07:34] <GuyverTypeL> TWIST THEIR DICKS
[3:07:35] <artoflec> more like vinDICKator
[3:07:37] <%aWanderingKaivo> nah, remember the Viper?
[3:07:38] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> you can get attachments that will make your guns lighter.
[3:07:39] <+Havictos> you get it later
[3:07:40] <DatAsuna> @Aiutare47 if you stack AP mods on AP ammo on inherent AP guns like the javelin, you can kill people from outside the combat room lol
[3:07:42] <%watts121> You don't have it yet.
[3:07:44] <+Scevda> Vindicator is dope
[3:07:44] <+MillerLowlife> every shooting range has the dicks only guy
[3:07:45] <Mattais88> The viper i think
[3:07:47] <+ComfortableStranger> don't use the raptor
[3:07:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The Raptor
[3:07:48] <%watts121> Raptor is my favorite.
[3:07:49] <+vaderxyz1970> Center Dick Mass
[3:07:50] <zerointelligence000> I forgot, did Pat say he never played ME3?
[3:07:51] <+Buzzkill983> Avenger is surprisingly good in ME3
[3:07:53] <%DrTomT18> Shot gun, Assult Rifle, pistol, put them all together with the weapon weight mod
[3:07:57] <satiresatyr> shepard is robo cop lmfao
[3:07:58] <+AmericanSkidd> pretty good
[3:08:00] <%capnbeefs> Tighter spread and great accuracy
[3:08:02] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Press the button to put targets farther
[3:08:04] <+MrATheGreat> Pistol
[3:08:04] <Mattais88> Until you find the mattock
[3:08:06] <%maskofmichael> Why are you just shooting the dicks?
[3:08:06] <%LumberjackJack> He doesn't even have that yet
[3:08:06] <%watts121> Raptor turns the game into easy mode.
[3:08:06] <%andrewofbob> We don't have the raptor yet
[3:08:07] <peachy996> I prefer full auto over burst fire personally
[3:08:07] <DatAsuna> the grenade launchers are anovelty but all lame
[3:08:08] <artoflec> just attach the Loudener to make it louder
[3:08:11] <%QueequegTheater> Center Dick Mass
[3:08:12] <secret_npc> If we cared about guns we'd be playing Soldier
[3:08:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> the raptor is actually pretty good, at least in multiplayer, its not as bad as it seems
[3:08:13] <+ComfortableStranger> you'll get it on surkesh
[3:08:14] <DatAsuna> I wonder what LE did with the pre order items
[3:08:17] <%Aleate> I love the Raptor. Raptor gang rise up PogChamp
[3:08:23] <%watts121> Raptor+Harrier is my go to tho
[3:08:24] <+Chaos_Aether> The Black Widow though
[3:08:24] <Aiutare47> @Aiutare47 Using AP ammo and the barrel mod on the typhoon made insanity bearable
[3:08:25] <+Peacefrog7> oh my god sheperd IS robocop
[3:08:28] <+AmericanSkidd> why? does it no read the tutorials?
[3:08:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Wait how does amd ATTACHMENT cause a gun to LOSE weight???
[3:08:30] <+Scevda> No mods?
[3:08:41] <Aiutare47> lighter parts
[3:08:41] <blackjack8182> Save up for the Harrier
[3:08:42] <%afronooch> @DatAsuna i think you get them from spectre store
[3:08:43] <peachy996> It's a really good room to test your guns
[3:08:43] <GuyverTypeL> "This one is to takedown police choppers"
[3:08:43] <psychoteletubby7> i miss the multiplayer so much
[3:08:43] <%DrTomT18> lighter materials
[3:08:46] <Laecerelius> ultralight materials
[3:08:46] <+unhuggable1> ez
[3:08:48] <%GabeSweetMan> aaaaah
[3:08:49] <+AmericanSkidd> or frame
[3:08:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Peacefrog7 dude. you JUST got that? atpRtsd
[3:08:51] <%andrewofbob> Pat got it right
[3:08:52] <%AncelDeLambert> typically the stock, not the barrel
[3:08:54] <Profmcstevie> Biotic magic
[3:08:54] <%GarbageNirvana> I imagine you're taking a part off to replace it
[3:08:57] <artoflec> but...
[3:08:58] <+ComfortableStranger> only thing good about the raptor is no hipfire pentalty
[3:08:58] <DSD24> You need better armor
[3:08:59] <ThatGuyThere03> and a whole bunch of other shit
[3:09:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah.. harrier is OP
[3:09:00] <%GarbageNirvana> and/or eezo
[3:09:00] <+MrATheGreat> What about anti grav systems
[3:09:02] <%lloyddboy> no you shove mass effect juice into it
[3:09:03] <%kastev> Wouldn't that make the gun weaker
[3:09:04] <%GabeSweetMan> Fair enough!
[3:09:04] <ThatGuyThere03> like skeletonizing
[3:09:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's lighter because you effect the mass
[3:09:06] <+RoByte2> Could be an attachment with a permanent mass field as well
[3:09:06] <holyxgrale> Also it's the future
[3:09:07] <tanarath> Better me mods to reduce weight, etc
[3:09:09] <Storm_Samurai> Hairy
[3:09:09] <%Arweynn> also Mass Effect antigrav
[3:09:11] <%capnbeefs> Fuck Udina
[3:09:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Typically they just use a Wire Stock instead of a solid one.
[3:09:14] <+Chaos_Aether> Smack Udina
[3:09:14] <KeystoneA2> Udina's assistant is in LotSB video
[3:09:14] <+vaderxyz1970> but the bulllet explosion break gun
[3:09:15] <tanarath> Smaller ammo block
[3:09:18] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you know Rowena in FFXIV is based off a real woman
[3:09:18] <+AmericanSkidd> These ME guns are really modular
[3:09:19] <+Peacefrog7> @Sphincter_Spelunker i just was like cool cyborg hero man
[3:09:20] <+MrATheGreat> Probably not
[3:09:21] <$Faustgesicht> Councilor BITCH
[3:09:22] <%Taisuru> @gabesweetman obviously it's filled with helium
[3:09:22] <ape_hawk> BOOOO-DINA
[3:09:22] <%LumberjackJack> "Ah, yes, humans"
[3:09:24] <Yuroshi> or the parts can have material removed
[3:09:28] <satiresatyr> i think all of us wont too
[3:09:30] <peachy996> Oh good they fixed his hair.
[3:09:31] <+ScrapKingKeita> How long has Pat been playing for?
[3:09:34] <psychoteletubby7> would blue man group be racist in this universe?
[3:09:34] <+Scevda> @kastev sometimes, sometimes it makes recoil more an issue or heat something of a concern
[3:09:36] <AluxStreams> This is the most chill Udina has ever been in his life.
[3:09:36] <ThatGuyThere03> THE COUNCIL CAN KISS MY ASS
[3:09:37] <+vaderxyz1970> Wait how is he on the council!?!
[3:09:42] <dd44dostivei> ME1 rooms make me happy
[3:09:46] <%GabeSweetMan> @Taisuru Oh of course, how silly of me.
[3:09:46] <secret_npc> "first Council world" get fucked Batarians
[3:09:47] <+ScrapKingKeita> Ah yes, "Reapers."
[3:09:47] <akitanito> earth isn't attacked, earth is gonnnnnnnne
[3:09:50] <peachy996> He used to have Jet Black/Brown Hair in the old version
[3:09:50] <Laecerelius> TURIAN GUY.  REAPERS.  HERE.
[3:09:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "Reapers"
[3:09:52] <FassieFons> UDINA DUM
[3:09:53] <%UvBenServed> Ah yes """"Reapers""""
[3:09:53] <DSD24> Oh god this is the worst
[3:09:56] <+Tizona824> Your choices matter Kappa
[3:09:57] <+Scevda> “Still gonna do nothing”
[3:09:57] <peachy996> It looked like he was using Just For Men
[3:10:00] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @vaderxyz1970 happens no matter what
[3:10:01] <%YakumoYomi> "But me, tho!"
[3:10:01] <FlyguyJP> Not Attack, INVADED
[3:10:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fake news
[3:10:05] <+MrATheGreat> I mean are they wrong?
[3:10:09] <holyxgrale> HELL YEAH
[3:10:10] <+AmericanSkidd> Then whats the point of a Council?
[3:10:11] <%DrTomT18> DO YOU HAVE A BETTER PLAN?
[3:10:15] <+MrATheGreat> fuck earth LUL
[3:10:15] <Mattais88> Undina talking sense for once
[3:10:19] <%watts121> Oh I don't know sir...what about these "reapers"?
[3:10:19] <KeystoneA2> "My planet is literally being glassed right now as we're speaking"
[3:10:24] <secret_npc> Welcome to the Council, Liara
[3:10:25] <GuyverTypeL> MAYBE
[3:10:26] <+ThomasOfTroy> Uniting the fleets is better than fucking NOTHING
[3:10:30] <$realm_forge> Politicians are the most unnecessary people to ever exist both in game and irl
[3:10:34] <+vaderxyz1970> DIVIDE AND DIE
[3:10:35] <FlyguyJP> Real Talk, nah they'd get rocked it they tried right now
[3:10:36] <Sp3ctre48> Shepard and Udina are being kinda silly here honestly

[3:10:45] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> SHUT UP UDINA what do you eve do ?
[3:10:46] <%count_bob> So at this point, Ashley is right. The Council literally threw humanity out to protect themselves.
[3:10:46] <%maskofmichael> But Me though, ME
[3:10:47] <holyxgrale> I'm amazed half of humanity thinks the reapers are real. Could have been a hoax
[3:10:48] <peachy996> I know for a fact the Salarians have a SHIT plan, The Asari have NO plan and the Turians are busy with their own burning world
[3:10:49] <dekkitout> Alright gang, split up and look for clues
[3:10:53] <%strakillias> But who decides who gets the help first is their problem
[3:10:54] <+Scevda> Split up and look for clues!
[3:11:03] <secret_npc> Ashley died for this
[3:11:06] <+Peacefrog7> mcguffin alert

[3:11:15] <+D00msDayDan> earth must be built like goddamn cadia to be able to keep fighting the reapers for like this whole game
[3:11:16] <satiresatyr> no~
[3:11:17] <%DrTomT18> Does ANYONE have a better plan, at all?
[3:11:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> that is not what that option said
[3:11:19] <+Chaos_Aether> Fuck  you Udina
[3:11:19] <FlyguyJP> Ok, if you know how HUGE this thing is, you would not use the word "Feasible"
[3:11:22] <KeystoneA2> #AshleyWasRight
[3:11:24] <satiresatyr> :)
[3:11:26] <GuyverTypeL> Yes?
[3:11:27] <Profmcstevie> Just chuck in that "usually fuck Udina"
[3:11:31] <$realm_forge> The catalyst is Miranda’s ass

[3:11:42] <Laecerelius> THey won't kill ALL the organics, just the sapient ones in space
[3:11:46] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Reminder that Ashley is being proven 100% right by their actions
[3:11:47] <ThatGuyThere03> they're just throwing earth to the wolves?
[3:11:48] <P1PressStart> Can't believe Ashley was right
[3:11:49] <+Chaos_Aether> Welp Earth is Fucked
[3:11:49] <IntrepidEye> Stand together! Leave your own worlds undefended and rush to Earth!
[3:11:52] <Mattais88> Udina faceplam
[3:11:55] <DSD24> The best we can do is nothing
[3:11:56] <+Peacefrog7> @MrATheGreat i take offense to that

[3:12:05] <+flexin_apex> If javik was in this scene ..he would shut everyone up
[3:12:05] <%count_bob> Ashley was 100% right.
[3:12:06] <$Faustgesicht> Welcome to the Council. You get to be the meatshield

[3:12:07] <+akscully> ashley was right
[3:12:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> your best sucks
[3:12:11] <DSD24> Ashley was right
[3:12:14] <akitanito> this is why destroy ending is canon
[3:12:17] <+unhuggable1> what happens if the council is human there?
[3:12:18] <+StrikeTheErf> it's not unfair to point out "why would we trade Earth getting glassed for our planet getting glassed"
[3:12:18] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> I AM THE SENATE
[3:12:19] <dekkitout> OH ARE THEY NOW
[3:12:19] <%kastev> Just like every politician!
[3:12:20] <knight_verse> Oh look, the hunter is sacrificing the dog to save themselves.
[3:12:21] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That scene literally just proved Ashley right
[3:12:21] <+MrATheGreat> @MrATheGreat Sry peacefrog
[3:12:21] <blackjack8182> Ashley was right!!!!!!
[3:12:22] <SovPho> Udina may be an asshole but he cares about Earth
[3:12:23] <%tank7013> And YOU aren't Udina?
[3:12:25] <LightningLynx89> I mean Ashley is right
[3:12:25] <+alphonseisbest> SHLEY WAS SUPER RIGHT
[3:12:27] <+AmericanSkidd> weve tried nothing and we are all out of ideas
[3:12:27] <+Peacefrog7> ASHLEY WAS RIGHT
[3:12:30] <%NeoCre> ASHLEY WAS FUCKING RIGHT!
[3:12:31] <FlyguyJP> When the chips are down, it's ever man for themselves

[3:12:40] <secret_npc> Let's be specific, ME1 Ashley was riggt
[3:12:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Udina would TOTALLY do the same in their shoes.
[3:12:41] <ThatGuyThere03> oh wait
[3:12:42] <Sp3ctre48> Like it's weird that they act like Earth is super important here when the Turian homeworld is also being invaded right?
[3:12:48] <Profmcstevie> It was not about humans, it's about "no I'm not being the meat shield"
[3:12:48] <tanarath> Ashley was W R O N G
[3:12:49] <peachy996> For once Sparatus and Udina are talking sense. That's wild
[3:12:49] <%lloyddboy> FEDORIAN?
[3:12:50] <ThatGuyThere03> is he secretly...based?
[3:12:53] <$realm_forge> We are convening a summit for a meeting for a gathering for a discussion to send the Reapers an angry letters
[3:12:54] <+senfood> Heh, Fedorian
[3:12:59] <+unhuggable1> hes based
[3:12:59] <Laecerelius> Off to Turian town!
[3:12:59] <%Ranryu692> @vaderxyz1970 you're leaving out the part where the reapers showed up and attacked council worlds
[3:12:59] <M0untain_wolf> Palavon!
[3:13:01] <FlyguyJP> Oh right. Palavin
[3:13:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> OH NOW IT'S YOUR PROBLEM
[3:13:05] <%tank7013> Interesting that the one most on your ass in the previous games is the one to come to you
[3:13:05] <%CollinsOfBodom> m'space lady
[3:13:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> See, this is eminently reasonable. Bullshit, but reasonable
[3:13:14] <+Scevda> M’turian
[3:13:16] <peachy996> Think about it the two biggest Politcal jackasses in the series are trying to help you first
[3:13:18] <ThatGuyThere03> yes
[3:13:20] <Mattais88> "reapers" huh?
[3:13:23] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> PALAVON ?
[3:13:24] <%QueequegTheater> FUCK SPARATUS
[3:13:25] <%YakumoYomi> "Solve our problems, while your planet is dying, and we'll help save the smoldering husk of your world"
[3:13:26] <+Chaos_Aether> Sigh
[3:13:27] <%GabeSweetMan> The Fedorians are so silly. Obviously they meant to call themselves the Trilbians.
[3:13:28] <secret_npc> Palaven is a great mission
[3:13:28] <DatAsuna> yup
[3:13:30] <%capnbeefs> He's not wrong
[3:13:31] <%kastev> BECAUSE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PLAY POLITICIAN
[3:13:31] <williamrooster> Oh boy Palavan....................................'s moon

[3:13:40] <+MrATheGreat> Turians are cool
[3:13:40] <%CollinsOfBodom> "is this reaper bothering you"
[3:13:43] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> UDINA looks like a crazy person
[3:13:43] <%watts121> Except we don't have the damn treaties
[3:13:45] <+Tizona824> It's dragon age but worse
[3:13:45] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt #AshleyWasSuperRight
[3:13:49] <%Larry_Q> wow it is isn't it

[3:13:51] <%Solid_Stro> You scratch my balls, I scratch yours
[3:13:53] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Pat, why does ME3 shepard look worse than the last 2? HES GOT ANIME EYES PAT
[3:13:54] <%LumberjackJack> ME3 is basically Origins, yup. Hence why the ending was a big WTF by BioWare vets
[3:13:55] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 thats my favorite thing about this beginning
[3:13:56] <Mattais88> The one you already had?
[3:13:56] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> UDINA CRAZY EYES
[3:13:56] <%Axellogic> Thats always been one of my complaints
[3:13:59] <M0untain_wolf> YEAAAAAH
[3:14:01] <Sp3ctre48> Bioware uses this plot structure a lot
[3:14:01] <TheSphereHunter> Patpard is perfect
[3:14:08] <%Torus1025> This whole game is just D tbh
[3:14:10] <$realm_forge> I love they just ripped off the term Primarch from 40k…..also fuck Games Workshop
[3:14:10] <%andrewofbob> Wait, Pat walked into the Spectre office BEFORE the conformation?
[3:14:11] <%count_bob> I love how the Turian councilor is like, the most reasonable person now.
[3:14:13] <FlyguyJP> I mean it
[3:14:15] <%GabeSweetMan> That was a good look at Shepards SPECIAL EYES.

[3:14:31] <GuyverTypeL> Punch Udina before leaving
[3:14:32] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> THIS COULD had been STar wars plot
[3:14:33] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat You should get Garrus in this mission before Javik. Both Liara and Garrus will give proper callbacks when you get Javik.

[3:16:23] <%castlerock42> God, I love that line from Udina. Hate him, love that line.
[3:16:24] <+StrikeTheErf> little oirish there
[3:16:25] <FlyguyJP> Udina is actually totally right here
[3:16:28] <peachy996> Udina is likable here which makes later all the more infuriationg
[3:16:28] <Minorou> great line

[3:16:34] <$Faustgesicht> Why's hhe slightly irish
[3:16:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> 11 billion? huh I thought there would be more humans
[3:16:38] <peachy996> infuriating*
[3:16:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Grey goo is terrifying to me because being "disessembled" on a nano scale sounds like the most painful way to die ever.
[3:16:39] <robosqueeb> udina be lookin ashy
[3:16:42] <Sp3ctre48> Their own worlds are being invaded Udina you're not special
[3:16:44] <Laecerelius> Only 11 billion?
[3:16:45] <%aWanderingKaivo> @DatAsuna yeah, they got it right :p
[3:16:53] <%QueequegTheater> CONCERN
[3:16:54] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder what the new council does
[3:16:56] <peachy996> He is reasonable
[3:16:57] <FlyguyJP> Udina is 100% a Politian but he is in his element here
[3:17:00] <%Hemmy99> 11 billion is just earth
[3:17:01] <peachy996> Love that line
[3:17:02] <AngryAsian5> He is reasonable here, he just gets the idiot ball later LUL
[3:17:02] <M0untain_wolf> PAT
[3:17:04] <LightningLynx89> He's totally right!
[3:17:05] <AluxStreams> Udina's a dick but he's a good politician.
[3:17:06] <pr0phetrahl> I love Drew Karpyshyn
[3:17:07] <%miguelrod777> it humanity last stand he's not crazy just an asshole
[3:17:07] <Vadrigar1994> Udina was always an ass, but wasn't unreasonable
[3:17:08] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna I'm so used to games using the wrong words. Also fuck soma.
[3:17:08] <dd44dostivei> sparatus was reasonable too
[3:17:09] <Mattais88> It's real surprisng that it's coming from UDINA
[3:17:09] <peachy996> "Constant News. All of it bad"
[3:17:11] <+tinytinykittycat> its a bad sign
[3:17:15] <Alzero83> Udina Trump....nah
[3:17:15] <SovPho> yeah 11 billion after the discovery of compatible mating with certain aliens is laughably low
[3:17:16] <M0untain_wolf> you should worry
[3:17:20] <%watts121> @Laecerelius on Earth, which has been going through an Exodus as people leave the homeworld for greener worlds.
[3:17:20] <%teefpal> Oh boy, Udina's characterization is saved!  I bet Bioware writers wont fuck this up with stupid shit AT ALL
[3:17:22] <%Hemmy99> Completely reasonable for once
[3:17:23] <robosqueeb> Heartbreaking
[3:17:26] <dawarw0lf> Udina was super right in me 1 in the beginning too remeu
[3:17:27] <NorwegianForestCatboy> woah what is that camera angle
[3:17:28] <%gliph13> @PatStaresAt  a broken clock is right at least twice a day.
[3:17:28] <+StrikeTheErf> Shepard, they're after our Lucky Charms
[3:17:31] <DatAsuna> @pr0phetrahl I like half his stuff, he didn't write ME3 though, he was writing swtor about now
[3:17:31] <%MidnightBurst12> Desperation brings clarity
[3:17:32] <Laecerelius> Oh, just earth
[3:17:34] <%Ranryu692> they're rather squishy
[3:17:34] <%snugglepuggs> Pat Sheperd’s anime eyes are distracting lol
[3:17:36] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt btw are you fully blind now?
[3:17:37] <M0untain_wolf> NUK'em is not a option
[3:17:39] <Zombrocom> By the way here is there names
[3:17:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ME2 mentions human colonies in the hundreds of thousands.
[3:17:41] <dawarw0lf> Udina became an asshole later
[3:17:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> They're dead but still

[3:18:38] <+Scevda> Special eyes
[3:18:40] <P1PressStart> Udina is now God Emperor of Humanity
[3:18:40] <%teefpal> @pr0phetrahl I really like this version of Udina.  Shame the writers didn't
[3:18:44] <dd44dostivei> Udina is the most powerful human in history

[3:19:21] <%QueequegTheater> ARE YOU IRISH OR NOT, UDINA? STOP SWITCHING ACCENTS.
[3:19:23] <Mattais88> It takes three games for Udain to get a character
[3:19:25] <draca23> I don't buy that he could do all this behind the council's back...Unless the Taurian is hiding his dealings.
[3:19:25] <peachy996> That's the last of good Udina.
[3:19:26] <%watts121> Udina: My networking is ruined!

[3:27:43] <Ravioli_Ronin> Like you couldn’t have a PTSD dream about anything that actually mattered to Shep?

[3:27:49] <Sp3ctre48> I wish Shepard cared this much about those 50,000 Batarians he killed

[3:27:56] <alcmo> renegade just means your an asshole, but still good at heart
[3:27:56] <+AmericanSkidd> To complete the dream you must touch the child

[3:28:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What do you think of this, Zach?
[3:28:00] <+RJay80> Renegade shep wanted to kill the child first and he regrets it
[3:28:01] <geckko12> because children are traumatizing
[3:28:01] <satiresatyr> a clone tbh
[3:28:02] <+D00msDayDan> kid's a fuckin brain parasite for the writers
[3:28:02] <Minorou> indoctrination is better than this

[3:28:22] <+ComfortableStranger> preaching to the choir pat
[3:28:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> Nothing made me happier to have Shepard hook up with Tali than the fact they can't have kids
[3:28:22] <secret_npc> The vignette is always there
[3:28:23] <$homelesstwinky> Renegade Shep's version of the child should be a Batarian he's trying to shoot
[3:28:23] <FlyguyJP> Remastered looks worse than I remember
[3:28:25] <draca23> This feel as slapped together as the ending lol
[3:28:26] <%Baby_Hotpockets_> Wait, it's a disproven theory?

[3:29:25] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can get your fish back later.
[3:29:26] <%Romuken> what if the child is you?  Renegade should be able to beat it up.  Also, your ship was impounded for MONTHS.  them fish be dead
[3:29:27] <secret_npc> Don't waste money on fish, Pat, please god!
[3:29:27] <%maskofmichael> You didn't feed them and they died
[3:29:28] <DefaultSettiings> dear god its like crayon
[3:29:29] <ThatGuyThere03> Now THAT'S in-character
[3:29:29] <blue8moon> fish died cause you haven't fed them for 6 months Kappa
[3:29:29] <FlyguyJP> Yeah the Theory that the Reapers are fucking with Shepard to make him buckle and lose hope is just too good
[3:29:29] <holyxgrale> THE REAPERS GOT EM
[3:29:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> Detained by the alliance for possible treason chrages
[3:29:30] <+tinytinykittycat> getting vaporized is a quick way to go
[3:29:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> At least Shepard doesn't look like he put a fire out with his face this time

[3:29:46] <%Monkeyweed21> HEY GURL YOU WANNA BANG ON THE ASHES OF THE CHILDREN
[3:29:47] <%LumberjackJack> Wouldn't that scene be a lot more horrifying to the player and Shepard if we saw someone like Ashley burning? Or your LI?

[3:30:42] <GohansBeforeHohans> @LumberjackJack Literally could have been any character we cared about but they picked some kid we met in the first 10 minutes scjLaugh
[3:30:42] <%ahomeschooldropout> Traynor is the doctor lady researching the mold in Control
[3:30:42] <%NeoCre> DOES THE DEATH OF YOUR FISH HURT YOU SHEPARD?
[3:30:43] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Traynor is GREAT
[3:30:43] <%Quigsies> brussy
[3:30:48] <FlyguyJP> Sadly, as a Man, you will not Bang, Ok
[3:30:49] <Profmcstevie> EXPELIARMUS SHEPARD
[3:30:50] <%gliph13> luv ya Traynor
[3:30:51] <%andrewofbob> She has a Kensington accept?
[3:30:52] <DatAsuna> neva thought
[3:30:52] <+condemned_15> Fookin Barmy
[3:30:53] <mikeriffic> Kelly was a simp
[3:30:54] <Mattais88> I went femshep exclusively for traynor
[3:30:55] <dekkitout> So is she your new Yeoman?
[3:30:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> Fun fact Shepard's first name is actually Commander, when you input a name you're inputting the middle name
[3:30:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pip pip
[3:30:57] <+tinytinykittycat> no such thing
[3:30:58] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Posh London accent, I think.
[3:30:58] <peyodogo> @Quigsies brushy
[3:30:58] <Marakami_Sadaneo> CAM ON INGERLAND
[3:31:01] <ShiningAxis> Traynor will never escape her sins of replacing Kelly for no reason
[3:31:03] <+AmericanSkidd> This bit is good
[3:31:08] <+Alig200> Alix Wilton Regan, her VA, is british iirc.
[3:31:13] <DefaultSettiings> shes saying words that sound better sofiePog
[3:31:18] <FlyguyJP> @ShiningAxis Kelly has that mad PTSD
[3:31:19] <%Ranryu692> Traynor is adorable
[3:31:19] <DatAsuna> Traynor isn't a varren fucker
[3:31:21] <%watts121> Old Kelly was fine, but new Kelly...jeezus
[3:31:21] <peachy996> Yeah Traynor is fine
[3:31:22] <Laecerelius> She doesn't fuck dogs like Kelly
[3:31:22] <+AmericanSkidd> that was fast
[3:31:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Britishness helps.
[3:31:23] <%Mikewrobe> shes so much better
[3:31:23] <+ScrapKingKeita> Kelly, the gal who boinked a varren
[3:31:23] <+Fooguwu> kelly is a thot
[3:31:24] <DatAsuna> just gay
[3:31:25] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> My dick is quantum argumented
[3:31:27] <akitanito> kelly just wants to hump everything
[3:31:28] <%somekindofsam> She's very gay
[3:31:29] <valriot> Traynor is great and is also THE BIG GAY
[3:31:29] <%MidnightBurst12> Understandable
[3:31:29] <%kastev> Kelly was too sexual
[3:31:30] <%bread_assassin> But SHE won't feed your fish for you.
[3:31:31] <%ahomeschooldropout> Her voice actress is the same as the mold lady from Control
[3:31:32] <$realm_forge> She’s the dominatrix romance option
[3:31:35] <+AmericanSkidd> EDI likes her
[3:31:36] <+Scevda> Anderson wanted your sex suite
[3:31:37] <mikeriffic> Traynor has a lot of personality
[3:31:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Traynor is best robosexual
[3:31:40] <peachy996> Nothing against Kelly
[3:31:40] <sirrice77> @ScrapKingKeita im sorry what?
[3:31:41] <mikeriffic> like her much more then kelly
[3:31:48] <Minorou> everyone seems to take the AI thing in stride
[3:31:49] <%Wallabri> I love you Traynor
[3:31:50] <+tinytinykittycat> lol
[3:31:57] <%Lizard0TM> uh oh

[3:32:01] <JetpackMcQuack> oh, my
[3:32:02] <%Blackleafx> Whats happening?
[3:32:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> @DatAsuna Yeah, you're right. We gotta get Kelly back
[3:32:03] <olaksi> bioware writing
[3:32:03] <wolfen091> she purposely hid herself
[3:32:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> first name basis huh
[3:32:04] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:32:04] <%Romuken> that was odd
[3:32:05] <%cade_calrayn> uh

[3:32:05] <Profmcstevie> hmmm?
[3:32:05] <%weissguard> EDI can just pretend they're a VI
[3:32:06] <Laecerelius> Amazing
[3:32:06] <KeystoneA2> Weird.
[3:32:07] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[3:32:07] <TourettesPlays> ya it does that sometimes
[3:32:07] <Dunmarkh> we felt that
[3:32:10] <geckko12> wow LUL
[3:32:11] <%Romuken> EDI IS GAINING CONTROL
[3:32:12] <%GabeSweetMan> WEIRD
[3:32:14] <FlyguyJP> Game is falling apart infront of our eyes
[3:32:14] <%Rumbutt> GAME COULDN'T HANDLE HER HORNINESS FOR AI LADY
[3:32:16] <%andrewofbob> New room
[3:32:17] <%JoshManVGH> While she was flirting with EDI
[3:32:18] <ThatGuyThere03> TRAYNOR'S TERMINAL THIRST KICKED YOU OUT
[3:32:19] <homestylewaffles> Legendary
[3:32:20] <%Monkeyweed21> COULDNT HANDLE THE GAY
[3:32:20] <DracaenaLeaf> froze for us until you went back
[3:32:21] <DianaTheAscian> we saw it
[3:32:21] <sougoe> it really wanted you to look at traynor
[3:32:21] <Profmcstevie> ASSUMING CONTROL
[3:32:21] <+tinytinykittycat> odd
[3:32:23] <mrtanaka111> whens legion
[3:32:23] <%shurtal> There's no fighting in the war room
[3:32:24] <%Blackleafx> LesbianPride
[3:32:24] <+condemned_15> EDI had enough of your shit
[3:32:25] <peyodogo> game is homophobic, didnt like traynor bein hot for edi
[3:32:25] <Profmcstevie> THIS IS MY STREAM NOW SHEPARD
[3:32:28] <%JoshManVGH> Why the photo tour!?
[3:32:28] <GohansBeforeHohans> Wait Kelly fucked a varren? Wtf atpCarl
[3:32:29] <BlockingDisabled> The scene was too cringe
[3:32:29] <+Scevda> He just missed it lol
[3:32:29] <draca23> I hate the Normandy in this game, only because of one (1) door/pathway...
[3:32:33] <DatAsuna> the ship is so much better in 3
[3:32:34] <%GabeSweetMan> At least we heard everything even if the volume dipped a couple seconds.
[3:32:34] <rytisone> Harbinger is taking control of the stream
[3:32:34] <+ScrapKingKeita> @sirrice77 One of Mordin's "Talk to me later" lines talks about how there is a rash going around, which only shows up as an STD from Varren, and Kelly fucks every alien she could
[3:32:38] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> The game couldn't handle the gay
[3:32:38] <%NeoCre> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[3:32:39] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Is this game cursed? Its being buggier than normal
[3:32:39] <DatAsuna> SR3 is the best normandy
[3:32:39] <williamrooster> ands the alliance confiscated your fish
[3:32:41] <dawarw0lf> Yes and it’s better for it
[3:32:43] <+AmericanSkidd> Her gaming setup is fuckin sick
[3:32:47] <%gliph13> Game could not handle Bri-ish Horniness.
[3:32:49] <DatAsuna> Hakcet is progress
[3:32:53] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA FUCK OFF MIRANDA THAT SHITS FOR LIARA
[3:32:55] <%LumberjackJack> Sounds good

[3:33:57] <Vadrigar1994> Lance Henrikson!
[3:33:58] <Aiutare47> @peachy996 during my replay, I forgot how short the main story is
[3:33:58] <JetpackMcQuack> He cool
[3:33:58] <dawarw0lf> I love hackket
[3:33:58] <%Eaglestrike117> God i fucking love how dire this shit is. "JUST GET ME SHIT, BEFORE I DIE" the game
[3:33:58] <+D00msDayDan> and you see his face while he talks to you
[3:33:59] <FlyguyJP> Hacket is the highest ranking Alliance man left alive
[3:34:00] <Laecerelius> Hackett's a super bro
[3:34:07] <dd44dostivei> hacket is your illusive man now
[3:34:07] <+flexin_apex> The point of authority
[3:34:10] <falyden> from a nameless admiral to a character
[3:34:13] <blackjack8182> Hackett is cool
[3:34:15] <TheIronBrass> RIP Lance
[3:34:22] <IntrepidEye> Hackett Out
[3:34:24] <%aWanderingKaivo> HACK IT OUT, SHEPARD
[3:34:31] <FlyguyJP> HACKETT OUT
[3:34:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> fuck Earth. I'm always a Colony kid
[3:34:35] <Psyramics> he wasn't nameless, he was in the first game with a name and everything
[3:34:48] <+AmericanSkidd> deep in the back
[3:34:50] <GohansBeforeHohans> This the only game you actually see him giving orders and shit besides the ending of the first game
[3:34:53] <%DrTomT18> He was, however, faceless
[3:34:55] <+Scevda> @psyramics truth
[3:34:57] <sougoe> don't let your soul be tied down by Earth's gravity
[3:35:05] <dawarw0lf> For later I think he meant
[3:35:05] <secret_npc> There is more than one Vid Com conversation
[3:35:07] <mrtanaka111> passive afressive pat
[3:35:09] <+AmericanSkidd> No fighting in the War Room
[3:35:12] <%DrTomT18> the whole ship looks like that
[3:35:13] <+akscully> cables everywhere
[3:35:15] <%SilverJakler> SilverJakler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! First playthrough I didn't know Galactic Readiness was tied to the multiplayer lol. Kinda cool feature though, had to have sucked for people without internet.
[3:35:17] <peachy996> This ship is very grungy
[3:35:18] <%aWanderingKaivo> @DrTomT18 you see him in ME2, Arrival
[3:35:19] <%DrTomT18> no look at it
[3:35:19] <%andrewofbob> TOUCH IT
[3:35:20] <draca23> This ship feels gutted and half finished
[3:35:20] <tanarath> War room is great
[3:35:20] <FlyguyJP> TOUCH IT
[3:35:20] <%miguelrod777> they finished it in a hurry
[3:35:20] <%QueequegTheater> LOOK AT IT
[3:35:21] <TourettesPlays> Pat did you remember your Galaxy At War code?????
[3:35:22] <%LumberjackJack> It's fine, you can touch it
[3:35:22] <wolfen091> you left mid construction
[3:35:22] <Profmcstevie> It certainly looks.....cleaner in aesthetic now
[3:35:22] <+akscully> touch it!
[3:35:24] <%CollinsOfBodom> someone call space osha
[3:35:24] <+tinytinykittycat> you should do that with tim
[3:35:28] <KaiserMario> Pat if you so smart how come you not want have not get now?
[3:35:29] <LightningLynx89> You can look a the war trminal
[3:35:30] <%rockcentuar> six months
[3:35:31] <%gliph13> BOOOOOOOO!
[3:35:34] <secret_npc> I meant for future Vid Com talks, sometimes Investigation questions look the same in later conversations
[3:35:35] <+condemned_15> touch it
[3:35:36] <%rockcentuar> remember this
[3:35:39] <Mattais88> Good old stangelove
[3:35:39] <%Shubreaker> I do like how piecemeal the SR3 looks
[3:35:40] <%Mikewrobe> a lot of empty consoles
[3:35:41] <%watts121> So how does War Assets work now if there is no Multiplayer?
[3:35:41] <peachy996> Meet your Goblins
[3:35:42] <%Rumbutt> make big number
[3:35:43] <%rockcentuar> six months to do this
[3:35:49] <+DracosMagala> Time to get the Spanish Inquisiton
[3:35:49] <%Rumbutt> number go up
[3:35:50] <draca23> What a pittance
[3:35:50] <+AmericanSkidd> Your Dick size against the Reapers
[3:35:51] <+RelikaNox> Oh god remember when you had to do multiplayer for this
[3:36:07] <williamrooster> opps
[3:36:08] <Sp3ctre48> I miss having the multiplayer factor into war assets so you didn't need to pay attention to this
[3:36:10] <+Scevda> Some of the retrofit makes no sense. Lets replace the warroom with a slightly different warrom and move the old one to the old lab room.
[3:36:11] <+condemned_15> oof
[3:36:14] <%andrewofbob> 5
[3:36:17] <FlyguyJP> 5 LUL
[3:36:17] <peachy996> 5 War Points lol
[3:36:20] <Profmcstevie> .....my baaad
[3:36:22] <+tinytinykittycat> babys first fleet
[3:36:23] <dekkitout> Dope
[3:36:24] <+AmericanSkidd> Hell yeah
[3:36:25] <Laecerelius> Of course
[3:36:25] <%Ranryu692> it kept everything
[3:36:31] <tanarath> Yeah!
[3:36:32] <akitanito> properly calibrated too
[3:36:33] <Sp3ctre48> Imagine being 5 points, get owned
[3:36:35] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt In the original you HAD to do multiplayer to get the best ending because there weren't enough assets
[3:36:35] <%LumberjackJack> 100 ASSETS, HOLY SHIT
[3:36:36] <ThatGuyThere03> Why would they get rid of ANY of that?
[3:36:36] <%Mikewrobe> no way they gonna get rid of free upgrades
[3:36:37] <KeystoneA2> and the cock and ball torture shields
[3:36:39] <%DrTomT18> just little extra!
[3:36:40] <%watts121> Note the Normandy by itself is worth more than an entire fleet.
[3:36:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> Normandy worth more than a whole fleet
[3:36:40] <+flexin_apex> The 2nd fleet got rekt
[3:36:41] <FlyguyJP> The Normany is worth TWO entire Fleets
[3:36:41] <dawarw0lf> That should be like 10000
[3:36:41] <+Scevda> Tits morale
[3:36:43] <%DrTomT18> Every bit helps
[3:36:43] <%andrewofbob> Get upgrades for living squadmates AND BETTER ENDING
[3:36:48] <peachy996> Khalisa is 10, double the Allers
[3:36:49] <%DrTomT18> TIME TO SCAN PLANETS PAT
[3:36:50] <dekkitout> One whole ass person has a fraction of a weight of an entire fleet huh
[3:36:51] <%RealThiele> Alliance: "thanks for the upgrades, suckers"
[3:36:53] <HyperionXV> The war corespondent is worth 1/13 of a fleet.
[3:36:55] <%Shubreaker> KHALISAH WAS WORTH MORE THAN ALLERS LUK
[3:37:01] <+AmericanSkidd> Yeah
[3:37:02] <dawarw0lf> BILLIONS OF METALS-100
[3:37:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> @QueequegTheater they changed that in a patch but it was like that originally yeah
[3:37:08] <blue8moon> Ship isn't finished LUL
[3:37:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yeah but MP was fun. Krogan soldiers headbutting all day
[3:37:13] <%LumberjackJack> Yup
[3:37:15] <DSD24> The Ship looks way better color scheme wise
[3:37:15] <+flexin_apex> The joker hole
[3:37:16] <peachy996> It's clunky and it feels that way
[3:37:19] <Profmcstevie> Military all the way
[3:37:21] <+Scevda> For no fucking reason
[3:37:22] <sougoe> just slap a glass box in there
[3:37:22] <draca23> The ship is half finished. You're driving a car without floor mats
[3:37:25] <Sp3ctre48> I hate this room
[3:37:25] <%Eaglestrike117> ITS THE WORST ROOM IN THE GAME
[3:37:25] <homestylewaffles> Military Grade
[3:37:25] <%afronooch> excuse me while i load
[3:37:27] <%watts121> Kinda shitty that they just threw all of Morridin's shit away
[3:37:27] <+AmericanSkidd> A in the Middle of a War Warship
[3:37:27] <%QueequegTheater> Yeah, the designers did a GREAT job
[3:37:27] <%RealThiele> shepard can finally look forward
[3:37:28] <+Ches_Neckbeard> I fucking love these 2
[3:37:29] <%TheotherKristian> oh LOOK its the LOADING door
[3:37:29] <dawarw0lf> These twooooooooo
[3:37:30] <%Ranryu692> Load Screen!
[3:37:31] <peachy996> Not a complaint but a design decision they got across well
[3:37:32] <williamrooster> the load sceen room
[3:37:33] <DSD24> Nice loading screen
[3:37:35] <FlyguyJP> Disguised loading screen
[3:37:35] <draca23> I HATE THIS DOOR SO MUCH
[3:37:36] <zerointelligence000> this room is horrible
[3:37:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Tim Gunn
[3:37:39] <+tinytinykittycat> they wrent done
[3:37:39] <blackjack8182> I prefer the ship in 2
[3:37:39] <wolfen091> it was still in the middle of being refitted, so shit is just lying around
[3:37:41] <+condemned_15> loading room
[3:37:42] <%ahomeschooldropout> There's a mod to skip that
[3:37:42] <%watts121> Also they just blocked of Jacob's room
[3:37:43] <DSD24> Oh cool its Traynor
[3:37:43] <%Quigsies> That used to be like half a minute
[3:37:45] <%gliph13> you'll be hearing alot from those 3
[3:37:46] <+Scevda> But that didnt need to be changed from the center
[3:37:47] <Ravioli_Ronin> Air Force one in space with CANONS
[3:37:48] <dd44dostivei> can't see shit in here now
[3:37:51] <%maskofmichael> ORANGE LIGHT
[3:37:54] <+Ches_Neckbeard> the door guards own and I love them
[3:37:55] <+Scevda> LOADING SCREEN
[3:37:56] <%DrTomT18> these extra missions give you war assets, do them
[3:38:04] <secret_npc> N7 Missions are the multiplayers maps, always worth doing
[3:38:05] <%lloyddboy> LUL
[3:38:06] <FlyguyJP> Oh right. The TOOTHBRUSH

[3:38:28] <dd44dostivei> chat shut the fuck up
[3:38:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oh no, not her toothbrush.

[4:10:41] <%sunsetdisc0> steve is actually pretty cool. shame hes just some shmuck they threw together in a character creator instead of an actual character
[4:10:44] <FlyguyJP> @stormhawk9891 Stumbling into becoming Gay is classic Pat
[4:10:45] <KeystoneA2> Pity we never meet Garrus' sister
[4:10:46] <+Havictos> Cortez is weird second conversation and it you have a chance to come on to him

[4:11:17] <%DrTomT18> I mean - he's fine.
[4:11:17] <peachy996> EXACTLY
[4:11:19] <%tusk102> YEAH
[4:11:20] <%Rumbutt> yeah
[4:11:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Garrus is manly man
[4:11:25] <%tusk102> YOU SUPER COULD
[4:11:26] <olaksi> new very minor characters
[4:11:26] <%gliph13> your not wrong
[4:11:29] <%Mikewrobe> kaiden
[4:11:29] <P1PressStart> They did it for Kaiden lmao
[4:11:29] <+jojo_abob> make him BI????
[4:11:29] <+WutangchickeN> LET ME GAY UP UDINA LUL
[4:11:29] <tanarath> You C A N
[4:11:29] <%demiiluna> They changed it for Kaiden
[4:11:30] <DatAsuna> They made Kaidan bi, so
[4:11:30] <secret_npc> Kaidan can be gay now but not Ashley
[4:11:31] <%watts121> I mean they did it for Kaiden.
[4:11:31] <%lloyddboy> STILL no gay romances for male aliens
[4:11:31] <Sp3ctre48> Well Kaiden is bi too now for reasons
[4:11:31] <Blank9> they do make kaiden bi
[4:11:31] <28moogles> Kaiden is bisexual now, you can do whatever you want.
[4:11:32] <%RealThiele> Latpandering with random spanish
[4:11:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> They did for Kaidan
[4:11:32] <KeystoneA2> mod him to take the D
[4:11:32] <%aWanderingKaivo> they did that for Kaidan
[4:11:33] <%Blackleafx> psaDogchamp
[4:11:33] <AluxStreams> I imagine everyone is bi in the future.
[4:11:34] <+AmericanSkidd> Shepard can as it turns out
[4:11:34] <%rockcentuar> Not really
[4:11:35] <+StrikeTheErf> they literally did in this game
[4:11:35] <%afronooch> i mean they kinda did with someone
[4:11:36] <Mattais88> They do it for KAiden IN THIS GAME
[4:11:36] <zerointelligence000> honestly... should have just made everyone available for everyone
[4:11:36] <%tusk102> you could literally just say garrus is bi
[4:11:36] <%tank7013> They did it for Kaiden
[4:11:36] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They did, Kaidan is bi in 3
[4:11:36] <Profmcstevie> That sends the wrong message
[4:11:37] <%Jeemukun> they made kaiden Bi
[4:11:37] <4DLuvOfLuthy> yea I was extremely glad when they finally let males romance Kaidan
[4:11:39] <%cvp5127> make every character player sexual
[4:11:40] <%JoshManVGH> Who says the space turkey can't love the D?
[4:11:40] <%trackles_64> shoehorned sexuality = bad writing'
[4:11:41] <%RealThiele> ITS EASY
[4:11:41] <FlyguyJP> Kaiden has a natural progression
[4:11:42] <peachy996> NOBODY WOULD PICK STEVE OVER GARRUS
[4:11:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Kaiden *cough*
[4:11:45] <%andrewofbob> Oh, they writer can change it, but then that's what the writer decides
[4:11:45] <Laecerelius> Bird wanna fuck ape
[4:11:45] <robosqueeb> You can change it but you shouldnt
[4:11:45] <draca23> As a bisexual, I disagree with changing a character's sexual orientation for the sake of satiating my game fantasy.
[4:11:46] <Virokwet> almost like this is a work of fiction
[4:11:46] <+robuttastic> HES AN ALIEN, CONCEPT OF HUMAN GENDER IS NOT THE SAME
[4:11:46] <+JaseAdrift> THATS A JUMP
[4:11:47] <%The_Protagonist> unless the character straight up says "i don't like dudes" they are not canonically hetero
[4:11:47] <%Puhff> Voice Acting is expensive but yeah, just change the pronouns
[4:11:47] <stantheman_97> there's nothing that says he not bi
[4:11:48] <dekkitout> Garry finds humans breedable
[4:11:48] <%teefpal> TRUTH
[4:11:49] <%Gorshum> Thanks.. I think?
[4:11:49] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Tali wasnt even romanceable in the first game
[4:11:49] <%DrTomT18> don't worry about it
[4:11:49] <Sp3ctre48> I WISH Garrus was Bi
[4:11:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you fucked Tali
[4:11:50] <stantheman_97> true
[4:11:51] <%UvBenServed> Toxic jizz
[4:11:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Kaidan is Bi here.
[4:11:52] <%Hitman0257> fair
[4:11:53] <+ScrapKingKeita> not only that, but a HUMAN WHO HE COULD KILL WITH HIS SPLOOGE
[4:11:54] <%DrTomT18> Cortez is cool
[4:11:54] <%tusk102> kaiden is bi at least
[4:11:55] <mrtanaka111> being gay is weird,pat said it
[4:11:55] <%andrewofbob> Ashley and Kaiden are now gay options in 3
[4:11:55] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[4:11:56] <%Blackleafx> Why would aliens have the same ideas of sexuality as us
[4:11:56] <%LumberjackJack> GayPride
[4:11:58] <%RealThiele> LITERAL ALIENS
[4:12:01] <+condemned_15> uuuhhh
[4:12:02] <%JoshManVGH> What even is human sexual identity to an alien?
[4:12:02] <%bravebravesrobin> make everyone bi; problem solved
[4:12:02] <Laecerelius> GARRUS IS A REVERSE FURRY
[4:12:05] <+condemned_15> phrasing
[4:12:08] <williamrooster> Garrus is basically pan
[4:12:08] <%watts121> I've seen both romances, and Kaiden honestly sounds more into Male Shep than he does into Female Shep.
[4:12:10] <akitanito> "these are the same things"
[4:12:11] <$realm_forge> To Garrus we’re all squishy
[4:12:11] <%trackles_64> THey fucked it up even more in Andromeda
[4:12:11] <Dabrikishaw> Remember almost every MaSS Effect 2 squadie was going to be Bi until Fox put the fear of God in Bioware
[4:12:12] <falyden> dextro animo acids too!
[4:12:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hahahaha
[4:12:13] <%LumberjackJack> LUL
[4:12:13] <%sunsetdisc0> they didnt even bother to make the new gays actual characters, they just threw them together in the character creator
[4:12:13] <%Ranryu692> LUL

[4:12:18] <+Alig200> @andrewofbob Ashley isn't a gay option.
[4:12:18] <+Scevda> That was done often in the bioware games following me3. Just adding gay characters for the hell of it
[4:12:19] <+StrikeTheErf> a smoothy
[4:12:19] <+JaseAdrift> NOOOO
[4:12:19] <%teefpal> LUL

[4:12:21] <TourettesPlays> FLESHY
[4:12:21] <DatAsuna> fleshy
[4:12:21] <knight_verse> That makes no sense.
[4:12:22] <Profmcstevie> FLESHY
[4:12:22] <peyodogo> A FLESHY
[4:12:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> GARRUS IS A FLESHY
[4:12:22] <Ravioli_Ronin> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:12:22] <zerointelligence000> Skinny
[4:12:23] <sirrice77> a fleshy
[4:12:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Kaidan is Bi here, they did change it.
[4:12:24] <%king_wragles> I mean, he'd still be a furry to other Turians
[4:12:24] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[4:12:24] <RedPlasticCup> Garrus: "Oh sure, I'll stick my weird bird dick into a human, but not a male one no homo bro"
[4:12:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> A fuckin Skinny
[4:12:26] <%afronooch> HE WANTS THAT HUSSY
[4:12:27] <Ids560> Garrus is also willing to fuck a Quarian
[4:12:28] <Deasmeister> Fleshy
[4:12:28] <%QueequegTheater> REVERSE SCALY
[4:12:28] <%tank7013> What would you even call that, a Skinny?
[4:12:29] <%AncelDeLambert> he's a Fleshy
[4:12:29] <+teg88> technically still a furry
[4:12:29] <%JoshManVGH> Cause of the exo skeleton!
[4:12:30] <+OneGorillionDollars> BONEY
[4:12:30] <$Faustgesicht> FLESHY
[4:12:30] <%gliph13> FUCK! don't tell me that!
[4:12:30] <wizardmanse> kaidan alenko shouldve been gay
[4:12:30] <%lloyddboy> FLESHY
[4:12:32] <+ScrapKingKeita> Just a reminder, that Garrus' semen can send you into ANAPHALAXYS
[4:12:32] <Sigma_190_Beta> HE'S A FLESHY!
[4:12:33] <mikeriffic> NO he is a reverse paige with her skeletons @PatStaresAt
[4:12:33] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt also the fact that garrus nut can literally kill you
[4:12:34] <%RealThiele> Fleshy lover
[4:12:34] <DatAsuna> TBF, Kaidan was bi in ME1 but they cut it
[4:12:34] <GustauveVIII> why ashley no gay tho
[4:12:34] <secret_npc> Garrus fuckin lady Turians too tho
[4:12:35] <%pilgrimsayswhat> SKINNY
[4:12:35] <%aWanderingKaivo> he's a mammaly
[4:12:36] <peachy996> They did it to Jaal in Andromeda
[4:12:37] <%GarbageNirvana> lmao
[4:12:38] <%DrTomT18> Kaiden has a mega boner for Shepard
[4:12:42] <P1PressStart> Imagining turians walk around with some weird human suit is... upsetting
[4:12:43] <Sp3ctre48> They DIDN'T do that for Ashley though, shits weird
[4:12:44] <%za7az> FLESHY
[4:12:46] <%Gorshum> Oh that's cursed.
[4:12:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Also these characters are fictional you can do whatever you want with em
[4:12:52] <$realm_forge> GARRUS LIKES EM SQUISHY
[4:12:52] <Maids4lyfe> kaidan's fly on the bi
[4:12:52] <FlyguyJP> But Ashley is pure hetero because of course she is
[4:12:55] <4DLuvOfLuthy> that sounds unpleasant lol
[4:12:56] <%AzureGale> I come back in on "penis". PERFECT
[4:12:57] <+D00msDayDan> furry isn't a strong as mammaly
[4:12:58] <Mattais88> Just pull a DA2 and make everyone Bi
[4:12:58] <earthgolem115_> where all my Fleshys at?
[4:13:00] <%tusk102> garrus nut can literally kill you also @PatStaresAt
[4:13:01] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Reverse Furry implies he has a skinsuit
[4:13:04] <%lloyddboy> MEATY
[4:13:04] <+akscully> he's a skinner
[4:13:05] <%Mathochism> DOES GARRUS HAVE A SKINSONA?!?
[4:13:07] <DatAsuna> CAG
[4:13:09] <%teefpal> @P1PressStart "It's my humansona, Shepard!"
[4:13:10] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Steve is fine
[4:13:10] <%captain_kirkhammer> "Grooming me for CAG" sounds wrong
[4:13:14] <%RealThiele> Garrus loves that soft, quishy flesh all over his thorax
[4:13:14] <olaksi> there's that part where Wrex makes a "women!" joke and they really missed a beat not making him unaware shepard might be a female human
[4:13:15] <%LumberjackJack> True
[4:13:15] <%RetroCop87> GARRUS ISN'T A FURRY, HE'S A HUMEKIN
[4:13:16] <+vilecrois> Does Garus have suspicious ammounts of disposable income?
[4:13:17] <+AmericanSkidd> I do like Cortez as a character
[4:13:17] <%DrTomT18> thats fucking terrifying
[4:13:19] <tanarath> Ashley is super catholic.
[4:13:19] <%trackles_64> @wizardmanse  He was there was  a cut cutscene on ME1, but EA said no cause controversey, the lead charachter was supposed to be Femshep as well.
[4:13:19] <FlyguyJP> Garrus in a human suit. Please stop.
[4:13:20] <%Varlinator> The only way the new Mass Effect will be any good is if we the player are able to sex ANYTHING & ANYONE!
[4:13:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you guys saying Skinny confused the fuck out of me. I thought you meant skinny as in weight
[4:13:24] <%Ranryu692> you are technically correct
[4:13:27] <AluxStreams> "I need to calibrate my skinsuit Shepard."
[4:13:29] <secret_npc> Garrus will canonically fuck Turians, humans and Quarians
[4:13:29] <%pilgrimsayswhat> NOPE DONT LIKE THAT AT ALL
[4:13:31] <+StrikeTheErf> Garrus doesn't yiff, he groans
[4:13:32] <peachy996> In Andromeda, They patched an alien romance so that men could romance him. It was that easy.
[4:13:33] <+AmericanSkidd> OH GOD I PICTURED IT YOU BASTARD
[4:13:34] <DianaTheAscian> thats nightmarish stop
[4:13:34] <mikeriffic> I HATE THIS STOP
[4:13:34] <%tank7013> Tali is also a massive reverse furry
[4:13:35] <%DrTomT18> fuck that ship lol
[4:13:35] <%bravebravesrobin> goes to fleshy conventions
[4:13:36] <%JoshManVGH> Garrus spent a LOT of time on Omega... weird shit happens on Omega...
[4:13:39] <Conscript_Gary> Cortez and Traynor are great, pandering or no
[4:13:40] <satiresatyr> im stealing your skin shephard
[4:13:45] <%Varlinator> & a minibar
[4:13:45] <FlyguyJP> Kodiak Cameras?
[4:13:48] <%teefpal> @secret_npc Garrus is a FREAK
[4:13:50] <dawarw0lf> It was WEAK AS FUCK
[4:13:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt garrus will also bang quarians
[4:13:51] <GustauveVIII> i mean technically as male shepard, garrus isnt a reverse furry
[4:13:51] <%Shubreaker> HE GROANS LUL
[4:13:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> @peachy996 plus modders do the same thing all the time
[4:13:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I, sadly, neither hate or like this character. I always felt meh about him. Like...they gave him the BARE minimum of rep, just to say they had the rep.
[4:14:01] <$Ziegsy> did i just see A DOG?!
[4:14:02] <%RealThiele> its no mako
[4:14:05] <FlyguyJP> HIMBO
[4:14:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @peachy996 Andromeda has about two drops of personality in it total
[4:14:09] <%trackles_64> Get a room
[4:14:09] <Meekest> This is so awkward
[4:14:10] <satiresatyr> pubby
[4:14:11] <peachy996> @aWanderingKaivo yep
[4:14:11] <dekkitout> I like the show...
[4:14:16] <+AmericanSkidd> LUL
[4:14:16] <%RealThiele> share the load
[4:14:16] <+akscully> lmao fuck off jacob
[4:14:22] <Meekest> They had zero gays in the writers room
[4:14:22] <secret_npc> Mako Squad rise up
[4:14:22] <%DrTomT18> Honestly, just do with Dragon Age 2 did. Everyone is bi.
[4:14:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah and?
[4:14:24] <Sp3ctre48> tbh I hope the next Mass Effect just gives you a love interest without a choice gay or not, if only to avoid the "Liara gets all the budget" problem
[4:14:27] <%za7az> psaDogchamp
[4:14:27] <+robuttastic> as a fem shep, i did not enjoy james
[4:14:27] <%Varlinator> Well.... not exactly
[4:14:28] <%teefpal> He's very normal
[4:14:30] <%tusk102> @Ziegsy yeah thats a robo dog
[4:14:34] <%JoshManVGH> Dude just working out while watching someone fix the shit he broke.
[4:14:35] <TheFramedWarlock> Now that I think about it, it's weird I've never seen a sci fi thing where aliens have a human fetish
[4:14:36] <%tank7013> James is actually just a better Jacob isn't he?
[4:14:36] <peachy996> @doc_ock_rokc that's the same amount of personality Cortez has
[4:14:37] <AluxStreams> James is super charming in his daily life.
[4:14:38] <%MightyDuckShoes> This game series was always going to look goofy with time. The chickening out on gay relationships while you're fucking weird squid pussy is a big incongruous bit of writing.
[4:14:39] <tanarath> Vega is GREAT
[4:14:42] <%Romuken> Family
[4:14:42] <%DrTomT18> James is great.
[4:14:43] <%Ranryu692> Vega is actually pretty decent
[4:14:43] <P1PressStart> James is underrated tbh
[4:14:43] <Blank9> james rules
[4:14:43] <%Blackleafx> Blessed Himbro
[4:14:44] <%Deft_Thought> YOU LOVE IT
[4:14:44] <%Broand> constant horny
[4:14:44] <JetpackMcQuack> he's all in
[4:14:44] <draca23> I do like their playful relationship. Not gay for each other, but Vega knows and is cool about his gay friend.
[4:14:44] <%Rumbutt> Vega's alright
[4:14:45] <%teefpal> "Family"
[4:14:46] <Vadrigar1994> James is great
[4:14:47] <+AmericanSkidd> Now go beat his ass
[4:14:47] <secret_npc> James fucking rules
[4:14:47] <%miguelrod777> James is fun
[4:14:47] <%tusk102> james is fine actually
[4:14:47] <Deasmeister> James is great
[4:14:48] <+teg88> Vega's awesome
[4:14:48] <%Varlinator> James is much better than Jacob
[4:14:50] <%Deft_Thought> Watch me get PUMPED
[4:14:50] <FlyguyJP> James is so outrageous I warm up to him
[4:14:51] <%demiiluna> At least James is better than Jacob
[4:14:52] <%Torus1025> James is amazing
[4:14:53] <+Havictos> @Dabrikishaw I'll be honest I actually liked the player centric sexuality of dragon age 2. Because characters falling in love with you because of you as a person rather your gender I actually kind of like
[4:14:53] <+ScrapKingKeita> Will Pat beat his pull up record?
[4:14:54] <dekkitout> Jimmy must be protected
[4:14:55] <%count_bob> James is pretty awesome.
[4:14:56] <ThatGuyThere03> THEM BICEP PEAKS
[4:14:59] <%DrTomT18> ROBO DOG IN BACKGROUND

[4:14:59] <wibbwobbler> LUL LUL
[4:15:00] <TourettesPlays> Who's James? You mean Slab Bulkhead????
[4:15:01] <secret_npc> James is the funnest party member
[4:15:01] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt He is a himbo who existed before people started to appreciate himbos
[4:15:01] <%trackles_64> Husbando
[4:15:02] <%LumberjackJack> James is the only "normal soldier dude" character BioWare got pretty well
[4:15:02] <%Shubreaker> Family

[4:24:15] <+condemned_15> Legendary Edition by the way
[4:24:15] <FlyguyJP> The LE is even buggier than the original.

[4:24:36] <%crimsonharvest> @Sphincter_Spelunker that makes a lot of sense she looks kind of uh... bursting at the seams like an oversize sofa
[4:24:36] <peachy996> BRAAAAAP time
[4:24:37] <+AmericanSkidd> the worst part of the galexey map
[4:24:38] <%DrTomT18> Scan planets = WAR ASSETS
[4:24:38] <%teefpal> Time to get Javik
[4:24:40] <%NeoCre> HAMSTER
[4:24:42] <%Torus1025> Get Javik
[4:24:42] <%dooscent> Eden Prime!
[4:24:42] <+NekoTheSneko> psaUp
[4:24:43] <%maskofmichael> Those are massive Reapers
[4:24:44] <%RealThiele> oh no tiny reaper icons
[4:24:47] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Eden Prime is your first mission Patrick
[4:24:50] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Sidequests has a time limit. Do sidequests first before the main missions.
[4:24:51] <+walternatorz> Day1DLC baby
[4:24:53] <%captain_kirkhammer> lmao anus basin because it's the salarian world
[4:24:53] <%LumberjackJack> The gameplay of searching with stealth kinda sucks, sadly. No consequence
[4:24:54] <P1PressStart> Honestly... hated the scanning game in this one
[4:24:56] <P1PressStart> Yes
[4:24:59] <KeystoneA2> Yes, you really should.
[4:25:00] <%Torus1025> Call it after Javik
[4:25:02] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt You can mod out the Reaper alertness or increase you're scan range if you get annoyed
[4:25:02] <Aiutare47> Palavan is short as far as missions go
[4:25:02] <28moogles> Nah, scanning is cool.
[4:25:07] <%metalsiren31> Yes
[4:25:07] <%afronooch> Absolutely
[4:25:14] <%teefpal> I don't think there's any mods for Legendary Edition
[4:25:14] <peachy996> Scan one a
[4:25:20] <+AmericanSkidd> OH YEAH
[4:25:21] <peachy996> YEAH SUFFERING
[4:25:22] <+Havictos> Alertness is so bad
[4:25:24] <28moogles> Suffer? It's a super cool mechanic.
[4:25:26] <+Scevda> Ya the scanning is prettt weak in this one
[4:25:26] <%Monkeyweed21> JAVIK JAVIK
[4:25:27] <+TheBigO75> yaay
[4:25:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Get Javik before you do any mission.
[4:25:27] <Laecerelius> Just a little suffering.  As a treat!
[4:25:28] <KeystoneA2> @teefpal But there are. Lots.
[4:25:29] <%Varlinator> Or, you could just... play the game normally?
[4:25:31] <%ahomeschooldropout> Instant scan and it prevents reapers from kicking you out of systems if you scan too much
[4:25:33] <secret_npc> Priority Missions last every time
[4:25:35] <%NeoCre> Do it legit this time
[4:25:36] <RushUnplugged> mission
[4:25:36] <RedPlasticCup> Scanning is fine in this one
[4:25:36] <peachy996> Reset the map by exiting the galaxy when the reapers come running
[4:25:37] <dd44dostivei> plot
[4:25:37] <+StrikeTheErf> mission based
[4:25:37] <+Kyma1020> none
[4:25:38] <%DrTomT18> mission based
[4:25:38] <Sp3ctre48> Mission based
[4:25:38] <$Faustgesicht> Mission
[4:25:39] <%LumberjackJack> Mission based
[4:25:39] <+Chaos_Aether> mission
[4:25:40] <%captain_kirkhammer> @PatStaresAt anything marked "priority" must be done last to do everything
[4:25:40] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Mission based
[4:25:43] <mikeriffic> none
[4:25:44] <%gliph13> missin
[4:25:44] <%AJ_Cherenkov> missions AFAIK
[4:25:44] <4DLuvOfLuthy> mission
[4:25:44] <%Torus1025> YEAH
[4:25:45] <P1PressStart> Mission based
[4:25:45] <+AmericanSkidd> Priority is just story mission
[4:25:47] <+StrikeTheErf> yes
[4:25:48] <+Peacefrog7> mission based
[4:25:48] <Mattais88> Just main quests
[4:25:48] <+OneGorillionDollars> @PatStaresAt mission based, whenever you want to get to them
[4:25:49] <%LumberjackJack> Yes
[4:25:51] <%afronooch> priority is plot
[4:25:51] <+cheesemun> yeah
[4:25:51] <+akscully> there's one timed mission though
[4:25:52] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Do all sidequests first.
[4:25:53] <%DrTomT18> you can recruit Javik right before the last mission
[4:25:54] <+Scevda> Depends on the system.
[4:25:55] <Dunmarkh> @teefpal pat was using mods in 2, I'd be suprised if there's none in 3
[4:25:56] <secret_npc> Priority = Main Campaign
[4:25:57] <%DrTomT18> lmao
[4:25:57] <+Havictos> @teefpal There are some mostly value and texture edits
[4:25:58] <Aiutare47> Priority just means main quest
[4:25:59] <%gliph13> yup
[4:25:59] <%DodgeJohnson> By the way you can quicksave on controller by pressing select
[4:26:00] <+myriad_truth> I don't remember anything timed in this game.
[4:26:00] <+walternatorz> so non-priority
[4:26:01] <%andrewofbob> There are acts that are hard cutoff on set missions
[4:26:02] <%Ranryu692> Priority is "important"
[4:26:02] <%captain_kirkhammer> HUGE ludonarrative dissonance
[4:26:05] <%NeoCre> None
[4:26:06] <%ahomeschooldropout> Priority is a main mission, N7 are side-quests
[4:26:06] <secret_npc> You will lose sidequests
[4:26:06] <FlyguyJP> Think of a dungeon. You WANT the dead ends first
[4:26:07] <+AmericanSkidd> its bass akwards
[4:26:07] <%RealThiele> the flying around with tiny reapers chasing your tiny normandy is dumb
[4:26:11] <+cheesemun> priority advances main story
[4:26:12] <28moogles> The scanning in this game is cool. Risk/reward stuff. Mods to take away mechanics are lame.
[4:26:13] <Mattais88> There's a few sidequests that are time gated
[4:26:13] <%count_bob> Priority means main quest.
[4:26:14] <%lloyddboy> MIND GOBLINS SCREAMING
[4:26:14] <%Monkeyweed21> Priority means japanese sword
[4:26:15] <%LumberjackJack> It's not too bad. Besides, chat will yell at you about certain timed missions
[4:26:16] <peachy996> Exit the galaxy when chased by reapers to reset their pathing
[4:26:22] <peachy996> It's the worst
[4:26:24] <Blank9> (low) priority missions
[4:26:26] <%andrewofbob> However, Eden Prime is TRUE PRIORITY
[4:26:29] <%hewlettfan96> its nearly 4 30 here in britbong land
[4:26:31] <%The_Protagonist> yeah it sounds like if you don't do priority quests soon enough you'll fuck them up or something
[4:26:31] <+Scevda> @28moogles theres no risk.
[4:26:31] <TourettesPlays> no reapas in dis system pat
[4:26:35] <+akscully> reapers aren't here
[4:26:36] <$Faustgesicht> This gets very silly
[4:26:36] <%The_Protagonist> bad naming
[4:26:36] <dd44dostivei> they're not in this system
[4:26:38] <peachy996> It's the worst way to scan
[4:26:39] <%captain_kirkhammer> @28moogles once you figure out how to game it the risk/reward goes away and you might as well just download the mod
[4:26:40] <+RyanTheRecluse> yes, but there are missions you need to complete and turn in before certain priority missions. pretty sure there's a list online.
[4:26:41] <%sunsetdisc0> a lot of times sidequests will disappear if you do a priority which ends the current act/begins the next one
[4:26:41] <+akscully> so they won't appear
[4:26:41] <Sp3ctre48> Narritively the Reapers chasing you is cool but it gets old really fast
[4:26:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> its kind of like any other game that has side quests but a main plot that is super urgent, the name "priority mission" just really points it out
[4:26:43] <%DrTomT18> this is a safe system
[4:26:46] <%DrTomT18> where you get fuel
[4:26:47] <+Soliloquy123> God, the reaper scanning thing was the worst
[4:26:47] <P1PressStart> This game can really fuck you if you aren't completing shit properly. You can just not be able to turn in a quest.
[4:26:49] <KeystoneA2> The Reaper icon above a system means there's Reapers there that will attack if you over scan. This system has no Reapers.
[4:26:49] <28moogles> @Scevda The Reapers
[4:26:51] <T_Sasquatch> @hewlettfan96 fucked up sleep schedule gang , wooo !
[4:26:51] <+Alig200> this system isnt reaper occupied
[4:26:52] <Mattais88> Empty system
[4:26:52] <secret_npc> The Reaper Chases are broken, they're no threat whatsoever
[4:26:54] <+OneGorillionDollars> @PatStaresAt as a warning, some priority missions act as points of no return when it comes to sidequests
[4:26:59] <%Ranryu692> it doesn't really work in ones where there's only one system
[4:26:59] <+akscully> try kite's nest?
[4:27:03] <28moogles> Go to a different cluster.
[4:27:04] <%captain_kirkhammer> only reaper systems have this stuff
[4:27:05] <%DrTomT18> This is safe system
[4:27:05] <pr0phetrahl> Every planet has interesting lore
[4:27:08] <28moogles> No
[4:27:08] <KeystoneA2> Correct.
[4:27:08] <%DrTomT18> yes
[4:27:09] <%LumberjackJack> Not yet
[4:27:09] <+Ches_Neckbeard> the Mass Effect wiki makes scanning stuff barable I highly suggest it. Yes there are cool things and War Assets to be found
[4:27:11] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> LanceCorpralScottBukake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Please dont drink the vaccine, please. I begging everyone in chat please dont butt chug or snort the vaccine, it will not wotk and everyone at Walmart will look at you. Love ya pat
[4:27:12] <LightningLynx89> You can find war assets
[4:27:12] <teebos> yes
[4:27:12] <$Futurecity10> No, there is stuff in non-reaper areas
[4:27:17] <28moogles> This is a mandatory one so they won't chase you
[4:27:19] <KeystoneA2> This is the Salarian home system though
[4:27:21] <%DrTomT18> there are no longer fuel stations in every cluster
[4:27:23] <%gliph13> @PatStaresAt if they catch you its GAMEOVER, but it check points you immediately before you enterered the system.
[4:27:23] <28moogles> Go to a different one.
[4:27:24] <Maids4lyfe> fly out of the red ring
[4:27:24] <KeystoneA2> The planet descriptions are neat though
[4:27:24] <Dabrikishaw> No Reapers and Unlimited Scan range on Galaxy Map Mod.
[4:27:25] <%teefpal> Look around, explore
[4:27:26] <$realm_forge> Correct
[4:27:28] <+Scevda> @28moogles ya? What happens?
[4:27:29] <+Havictos> @P1PressStart I fucked up the eden prime colony resistance quest because of that
[4:27:32] <$Futurecity10> Some systems are empty
[4:27:34] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You enter solar systems the at the same angle your ship points at. Redirect your ship to shortcut your way to key points in the area.
[4:27:36] <Conscript_Gary> There's stuff in nonreaper areas but some systems just have nothing
[4:27:43] <secret_npc> You'll get a % rating for each system, so you'll know if there's studf
[4:27:44] <+Scevda> Answer: fucking nothing happens.  Nothing is loss
[4:27:45] <dawarw0lf> Never buy fuel. You get free refills from the citadel
[4:27:47] <knight_verse> There's nothing in Annos Basin
[4:27:48] <%afronooch> Palaven is plot
[4:27:50] <DatAsuna> yes
[4:27:50] <%ahomeschooldropout> TES
[4:27:51] <+Chaos_Aether> Yes
[4:27:51] <%Ranryu692> No
[4:27:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt homeworld systems are usually empty
[4:27:53] <zerointelligence000> yes
[4:27:53] <+OneGorillionDollars> YES
[4:27:55] <Sp3ctre48> It should be yes
[4:27:55] <+DracosMagala> yes
[4:27:55] <Mattais88> yeah
[4:27:55] <$Futurecity10> YES
[4:27:55] <%RealThiele> ok one scan per system mod might help psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:27:55] <%LumberjackJack> Yes
[4:27:55] <+Ches_Neckbeard> yes Eden Prime first
[4:27:55] <secret_npc> Eden or N7
[4:27:56] <Laecerelius> yeah
[4:27:57] <%Ranryu692> You can't take Javik to Palaven
[4:27:57] <%afronooch> eden prime is dlc
[4:27:57] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[4:27:57] <mr_saturday93> YEE YES YES
[4:27:57] <%DrTomT18> Don't miss the intel on eden prime!
[4:27:58] <teebos> YEAHH
[4:27:59] <%demiiluna> 100%
[4:27:59] <%QueequegTheater> PALAVEN FIRST
[4:27:59] <+akscully> palaven is plotty
[4:28:00] <%count_bob> Yes.
[4:28:00] <tommyboy96> PALAVEN
[4:28:01] <Maids4lyfe> DO EDEN FIRST
[4:28:01] <%gliph13> EDEN PRIME all the way
[4:28:02] <%Monkeyweed21> YEYEYEYE
[4:28:03] <Ravioli_Ronin> Yes
[4:28:05] <dawarw0lf> Palven then Eden
[4:28:07] <%andrewofbob> Eden Prime won't cut anything off
[4:28:08] <knight_verse> Palaven, then Eden Prime
[4:28:08] <28moogles> That's not how scanning works
[4:28:09] <+Fooguwu> gross
[4:28:09] <DatAsuna> burfday
[4:28:09] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:28:09] <+Ches_Neckbeard> ewww smooching
[4:28:10] <P1PressStart> @Havictos I fucked up the same one. It was stuck in my quest log the rest of the game and it killed me.
[4:28:10] <%Varlinator> I prefer doing Palavan 1st personally
[4:28:11] <%captain_kirkhammer> "smooch"
[4:28:11] <$realm_forge> YES
[4:28:12] <28moogles> Scan non story areas
[4:28:13] <dawarw0lf> so you can have garrus
[4:28:18] <%demiiluna> "Smooch"
[4:28:18] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt you can't take Javik to Palaven so you might as well do Palaven first
[4:28:20] <FlyguyJP> It's Paige's Bday?! Where's the Birthday Girl at?
[4:28:21] <+Peacefrog7> eden prime should be first
[4:28:21] <%count_bob> "Smooch"
[4:28:22] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you do palaven first you get extra dialogue
[4:28:24] <%hewlettfan96> hope you sae my cheer!!!
[4:28:24] <peachy996> BRAP
[4:28:26] <TourettesPlays> kiss that wife FootGoal FootGoal FootGoal FootGoal
[4:28:26] <Aiutare47> Eden Prime is dlc
[4:28:27] <%Varlinator> exactly
[4:28:29] <+myriad_truth> Yes!
[4:28:30] <+AmericanSkidd> Priority: Kiss your Wife
[4:28:31] <+Scevda> Nice
[4:28:33] <%RealThiele> Smooch with Bepis
[4:28:33] <$realm_forge> Subtle pat
[4:28:41] <%DrTomT18> yes
[4:28:41] <28moogles> Go to one of the other places in this system
[4:28:41] <KeystoneA2> YUP
[4:28:42] <%Monkeyweed21> VEGA HAS AMAZING LINES FOR THIS
[4:28:43] <%andrewofbob> Palavin is kinda the last thing of the prologue
[4:28:45] <dd44dostivei> yeeeep
[4:28:45] <%hewlettfan96> subtle Paat
[4:28:46] <+KShirahama> Yes
[4:28:47] <secret_npc> Palaven, Eden Prime, N7
[4:28:48] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[4:28:51] <%teefpal> Yeah, mind goblin time
[4:28:51] <%AncelDeLambert> just get a mod or look at a guide
[4:28:51] <%captain_kirkhammer> And half of them are just fuel! Yay!
[4:28:52] <Sp3ctre48> Yeeeah
[4:28:52] <%DrTomT18> its usually just fuel
[4:28:55] <+Goraka91> Sure does
[4:28:55] <%somekindofsam> it does
[4:28:55] <rytisone> goblins rise up
[4:28:55] <zerointelligence000> yeah but I think the important stuff is always on planets
[4:28:56] <Botman_R> Just planets, I think.
[4:28:56] <+akscully> non-planet ones are almost always fuel
[4:28:56] <KeystoneA2> Good luck finding fuel depos in the vast darkness of a system's space
[4:28:57] <%RealThiele> YEA
[4:28:57] <%gliph13> LOAD up the MOD PAT!
[4:28:58] <FassieFons> VoteYea
[4:28:59] <%teefpal> It's to encourage exploration
[4:29:00] <4DLuvOfLuthy> yep it does lol
[4:29:00] <%RealThiele> MOD INC
[4:29:00] <+OneGorillionDollars> thats why the mod was recommended
[4:29:03] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Any time you see a object that's in the middle of nowhere it's usually a fuel station
[4:29:03] <%count_bob> There's guides for it.
[4:29:03] <+D00msDayDan> they really didn't need to add more gameplay to this part of the game
[4:29:05] <peachy996> they'll go BRAAAAP and enter from the outside rim
[4:29:05] <knight_verse> Always takw the fuel last.
[4:29:06] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt the floating ones are usually fuel, so sometimes it's better to save them for last because there are fewer fuel depots in this game
[4:29:06] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Seriously Pat save yourself from the mind Goblins the wiki entry on scannable stuff will save you
[4:29:07] <%metalsiren31> You're right it does suck
[4:29:09] <TourettesPlays> why the fuck would a shitty gas giant be called Zion
[4:29:09] <%DrTomT18> pat
[4:29:09] <mr_sups> Scanning in ME3 sucks boooty
[4:29:10] <+condemned_15> time for GameFAQ
[4:29:10] <28moogles> Hold the scan?
[4:29:10] <P1PressStart> follow the arrow
[4:29:11] <mr_saturday93> pat.....
[4:29:13] <valriot> Pat..
[4:29:14] <Ravioli_Ronin> It’s not as bad as having to scan EVERY planet in 2
[4:29:14] <AngryAsian5> Follow the line
[4:29:14] <$Faustgesicht> White cursor
[4:29:15] <%Quigsies> No more resources from probing
[4:29:15] <Mattais88> Single point
[4:29:17] <RushUnplugged> white line is a direction
[4:29:17] <%DrTomT18> follow. the. white. line.
[4:29:17] <%teefpal> See the line
[4:29:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> launch when its a dot
[4:29:18] <+Scevda> Yep its poor
[4:29:18] <+akscully> follow white line
[4:29:18] <%AzureGale> Fair
[4:29:25] <Maids4lyfe> FOLLOW THE LINE
[4:29:28] <%bread_assassin> It kinda sucks that Kaiden is gone for now, since I'm sure he'd have a ton of unique dialogue if you brought him to Eden Prime, but I don't wanna wait to get Javik.
[4:29:30] <%Ranryu692> this planet is done
[4:29:35] <+D00msDayDan> no more resources to probe for because you already bled the galaxy dry in 2
[4:29:35] <%DrTomT18> you did it! your first war arrest
[4:29:36] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Major quests in reaper-infested system WILL NOT be infested.
[4:29:36] <%QueequegTheater> NUMBER GOES UP
[4:29:37] <P1PressStart> number go up
[4:29:37] <28moogles> Go to a different cluster in this system
[4:29:39] <%DrTomT18> congrats
[4:29:40] <%Ranryu692> only one probe needed per planet
[4:29:41] <%teefpal> I dunno why people dislike this stuff, it's very chill
[4:29:44] <secret_npc> If there's a mod to skip scanning ... yeah that might be good
[4:29:57] <%Varlinator> yeah you can
[4:30:02] <secret_npc> Fuel costs money
[4:30:11] <+myriad_truth> Get best boy first!
[4:30:12] <+akscully> sometimes systems open up after priority missions too
[4:30:14] <%DrTomT18> REAPERS ARE COMING
[4:30:18] <KeystoneA2> Systems with Priority/playable side missions won't trigger a Reaper chase, but all others will
[4:30:18] <mr_saturday93> REAPERS
[4:30:19] <%teefpal> Reapers
[4:30:19] <AngryAsian5> Reapers
[4:30:21] <peachy996> BRAP
[4:30:23] <%RealThiele> this is the worst part of the game
[4:30:24] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Reapers
[4:30:24] <%barrakuta371> monkaS
[4:30:25] <stantheman_97> reapers
[4:30:25] <28moogles> Scan again and find out
[4:30:25] <+Scevda> @teefpal its best version was still wonky in me1. Exploration was always me’s weakest game pillar
[4:30:26] <Maids4lyfe> reapers
[4:30:26] <%AncelDeLambert> if you ping again, Reapers show up
[4:30:28] <%YakumoYomi> Red Arrows are where the reapers will approach from
[4:30:28] <+Ches_Neckbeard> the red arrows are where Reapers enter the system
[4:30:28] <dawarw0lf> You can get free refills from the citadel every time you dock there
[4:30:30] <%Ranryu692> Headphones users turn down your volume
[4:30:32] <+condemned_15> Reapers!
[4:30:32] <Ravioli_Ronin> Beepers
[4:30:37] <%teefpal> Yep
[4:30:37] <secret_npc> If the Reapers chase you, you can just exit and reenter
[4:30:39] <+AmericanSkidd> big mods for big boys
[4:30:41] <%Ranryu692> why did you tell him?
[4:30:42] <$realm_forge> Save the fuel drops in the first system for when you come back
[4:30:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> idk I really didn't find it that bad myself
[4:30:49] <%andrewofbob> Make sure you ping accurately
[4:30:50] <%YakumoYomi> Red arrows show where they will come from
[4:30:51] <peachy996> Ping again, you can reset them and leave
[4:30:51] <RushUnplugged> the mod makes the system scan wider so you need 1-2 to reveal stuff, and planet scanning much faster
[4:30:54] <%teefpal> You can leave the system and come back
[4:30:59] <peachy996> They don't chase you to another galaxy
[4:31:01] <28moogles> It's super cool lol
[4:31:01] <ErikFeral> did the audio distort during those zooms??
[4:31:02] <stormhawk9891> guess
[4:31:03] <FlyguyJP> Just know it, nerd.
[4:31:04] <%captain_kirkhammer> You infer
[4:31:06] <%Ranryu692> don't spam it, space them out
[4:31:07] <%count_bob> GUides.
[4:31:09] <%DrTomT18> thats an upgrade
[4:31:13] <%andrewofbob> There's a noise around stuff (including planets)
[4:31:14] <+condemned_15> don't spam
[4:31:15] <secret_npc> Also the direction your Normandy is facing will determine what side of the system you'll enter
[4:31:15] <+Ches_Neckbeard> wiki entry on scannable objects will let you ping the scanner accurately
[4:31:17] <P1PressStart> Also sucks there are way fewer fuel depots and you end up relying on finding fuel through your pings
[4:31:17] <%captain_kirkhammer> @ErikFeral Twitch doies that shit sometimes
[4:31:18] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt try not to overlap your pings when possible
[4:31:20] <Aiutare47> On that one is good
[4:31:20] <28moogles> Ping again do it
[4:31:21] <%QueequegTheater> Do it coward
[4:31:21] <%DrTomT18> you can
[4:31:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just ping accurately 4Head
[4:31:25] <%DrTomT18> just be careful
[4:31:26] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Reapers will start off slow and accelerate until they kill you. You have leeway for like 10 seconds.
[4:31:26] <%Varlinator> there's one on Terra Nova
[4:31:27] <%ahomeschooldropout> Do it again and see what happens
[4:31:27] <+akscully> no you can ping more
[4:31:31] <%afronooch> do it
[4:31:31] <KeystoneA2> You can do whatever you want, but Reapers will come for your booty.
[4:31:31] <%Ranryu692> just do it and stay ahead of them
[4:31:32] <+AmericanSkidd> you are just run after
[4:31:32] <secret_npc> No just scan whenever
[4:31:32] <%teefpal> I'm waiting for the Expanded Galaxy Mod
[4:31:32] <+akscully> reapers will show up
[4:31:34] <+RyanTheRecluse> there's a little audio cue when your near something you can scan I think?
[4:31:36] <JetpackMcQuack> They chase you like pacman ghosts
[4:31:36] <peachy996> Get to 100% and then ping them for funsies, then leave the system
[4:31:37] <+Goraka91> monkaS
[4:31:37] <FlyguyJP> BWAAAANG
[4:31:37] <dawarw0lf> You can you just have to juke the reapers
[4:31:38] <%Varlinator> ping scan & run
[4:31:39] <Profmcstevie> try it out :)

[4:31:49] <ErikFeral> pat run
[4:31:49] <%teefpal> Ok now FLEE
[4:31:51] <AngryAsian5> They just chase you

[4:31:53] <TourettesPlays> you leave, go to another cluster entirely, and then come back LUL LUL LUL
[4:31:55] <peachy996> Now leave the system to reset their pathing

[4:31:57] <%RealThiele> leave and come back being the solution is also hilarious
[4:31:58] <+xerotwo> BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[4:31:59] <%LumberjackJack> It's a really dumb mechanic. No real tension. If you get caught, it game overs, then you just reload in the system
[4:31:59] <%andrewofbob> Just parked there
[4:32:05] <secret_npc> The Reapers aren't a threat, honest to god, just leave through the green border and reenter
[4:32:05] <FlyguyJP> The Inception reapers

[4:33:50] <KeystoneA2> You can exit a system, then angle which way you want to enter it
[4:33:52] <+akscully> have to do a mission first
[4:33:53] <+xerotwo> BWAAAAAAAAA
[4:33:53] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt when you enter a system, the Normandy will maintain its orientation, so you can pick where you want to start
[4:33:54] <28moogles> No

[4:34:06] <+JaseAdrift> God this system is just the worst
[4:34:06] <%sunsetdisc0> enter the system from a different angle
[4:34:08] <%andrewofbob> The direction you face is were you enter
[4:34:08] <+AmericanSkidd> BWAAAA
[4:34:08] <+Ches_Neckbeard> how can this be
[4:34:09] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Your position resets depending on where you point when you enter. Point up to come from the bottom.
[4:34:09] <+condemned_15> BRRRRRR
[4:34:10] <TourettesPlays> turn your ship in a differen direction
[4:34:11] <%HaroldDonchee> just fuck with them
[4:34:11] <%Ixiah> @PatStaresAt  later
[4:34:12] <%afronooch> if you turn so your facing up you'll come in from the bottom
[4:34:12] <notsoy> come back after a mission

[4:34:14] <+condemned_15> LUL
[4:34:16] <TheIronBrass> Amazing
[4:34:16] <Mattais88> You enter based on what way the ship is pointing
[4:34:16] <%maskofmichael> Reapers fart on the galaxy
[4:34:16] <dd44dostivei> APPROACH SYSTEM FROM THE SOUTH
[4:34:16] <%gliph13> depends on the ships position when you enter the system
[4:34:17] <%CarrowayFashonti> You don't
[4:34:17] <%DrTomT18> do a mission
[4:34:17] <secret_npc> The direction your Normandy faces determines where you'll enter
[4:34:18] <+xerotwo> ONLY REAPERS
[4:34:19] <rytisone> come back later
[4:34:19] <%Varlinator> You'll have to come back to this later
[4:34:20] <4DLuvOfLuthy> it resets after a mission
[4:34:21] <tengel66> lol
[4:34:21] <choocheess> just gonna keep tiptoeing it?
[4:34:22] <karl_rex> Come back later
[4:34:22] <Reverend_Godshyne> You enter at the point your ship is facing
[4:34:22] <psychoteletubby7> different angle
[4:34:24] <KeystoneA2> @PatStaresAt You can control what angle you enter a system from; it was in ME2.
[4:34:24] <+D00msDayDan> reapers lewded
[4:34:24] <+xerotwo> ONLY BWWWWAAAAAAAA
[4:34:25] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the angle you enter the system matters
[4:34:26] <mr_saturday93> Come back later....
[4:34:26] <+traximus_s> woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:34:26] <%RealThiele> you start based on ship poisition maybe

[4:34:28] <+EmptyMug> "That's the neat thing, you don't"
[4:34:28] <Mattais88> yeah
[4:34:28] <peachy996> Welcome to why I shat on this so much in previous stream
[4:34:29] <+condemned_15> just come back later
[4:34:30] <%shurtal> the direction the normandy is facing when entering the system determines where you appear @PatStaresAt
[4:34:31] <%Piemono> Come back later
[4:34:33] <secret_npc> Or mod it
[4:34:33] <+akscully> have to do a mission first to reset reapers
[4:34:34] <%teefpal> Not really
[4:34:34] <Sp3ctre48> yep
[4:34:34] <%LumberjackJack> Like I said, it's really dumb. You can still can and still collect quickly, but the annoying reapers will always harass
[4:34:35] <+AmericanSkidd> so you mod it
[4:34:36] <%DrTomT18> you need every war arrest to  get the best ending
[4:34:37] <mr_saturday93> No...
[4:34:39] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt they leave after you do some missions
[4:34:41] <P1PressStart> Best not
[4:34:42] <%count_bob> Or mod it.
[4:34:43] <mr_saturday93> Come back later
[4:34:45] <Virokwet> good idea
[4:34:45] <tanarath> Not after every mission
[4:34:45] <karl_rex> Just come back later
[4:34:47] <dawarw0lf> No it’s possible to get them even if your being chased
[4:34:49] <%NeoCre> Angle yourself Pat
[4:34:49] <dekkitout> Grind it offscreen
[4:34:49] <+myriad_truth> Don't fear the Reaper
[4:34:50] <Mattais88> Awww
[4:34:50] <%Ixiah> install a mod
[4:34:50] <%RealThiele> SURE DO
[4:34:51] <secret_npc> Every new system, and sometimes new ones appear in existing systems
[4:34:54] <28moogles> There's only so many assets
[4:34:54] <peachy996> Hell yeah you're not! they suck!
[4:34:57] <+Scevda> Reccomended
[4:34:57] <$homelesstwinky> bUt CoNtEnT
[4:34:58] <dd44dostivei> ITS SUPER EASY TO CHEESE ONCE YOU GET IT
[4:34:59] <%DrTomT18> you should read the War Asset description before the final mission, some of them are interesting
[4:35:00] <%andrewofbob> Maybe there's a mod to slow the reapers down
[4:35:01] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt you'll be able to juke them with practice
[4:35:02] <TourettesPlays> @DrTomT18 not in LE you don't
[4:35:03] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Pat just use the wiki for scannable stuff it becomes so simple

[4:43:28] <Profmcstevie> Delete her opinion

The fact that you're reading this sub message means that our energies are aligned. Happy 29 months Patricia. Also, glad to hear you're gonna check out Forgotten City!

[4:43:57] <%Puhff> hehehe ass
[4:44:11] <Zombrocom> Man, I don't remember kai lang at all. Like, AT ALL. Not even that he existed. Who the fuck is kai leng.
[4:44:15] <GustauveVIII> you mean the president?
[4:44:16] <+D00msDayDan> were it so easy
[4:44:17] <%afronooch> Keith David is amazing
[4:44:25] <Profmcstevie> so this is your fault
[4:44:25] <T_Sasquatch> kai leng is a chaacter thats meant to be cool but is a complete bitch
[4:44:25] <%Puhff> yes
[4:44:27] <peachy996> Man made Spawn way better
[4:44:28] <RushUnplugged> you mean Keith Fucking David
[4:44:28] <%maskofmichael> He's the Prez in RAM
[4:44:29] <%weissguard> I remember when he was in Saint's Row IV, and I liked it.
[4:44:29] <%AncelDeLambert> VICE President
[4:44:31] <%afronooch> 100% the reason why I even played Mass Effect originally
[4:44:32] <%AzureGale> Keith David is a cool dude
[4:44:33] <Mattais88> Keith David, Mark Hamill,...
[4:44:33] <%lloyddboy> YEAAAAAAAAAAAH
[4:44:34] <rytisone> that's why aliens steal him in Saints Row 4
[4:44:35] <$KnivesEve> YES
[4:44:38] <%HaroldDonchee> gargoyles was the fucking shit
[4:44:38] <KaiserMario> THEY LIVE
[4:44:44] <GustauveVIII> i think keith david's only problem is that i always know its keith david
[4:44:45] <peachy996> Or The Thing
[4:44:49] <peachy996> Or Gargoyles
[4:44:51] <+vaderxyz1970> Kieth David is best playing Kieth David
[4:44:55] <%AzureGale> I <3 Goliath
[4:45:01] <$realm_forge> Every time I have a cold I crave a hot mug of his voice
[4:45:02] <%somekindofsam> or just watch They Live
[4:45:02] <+D00msDayDan> but that's the best part
[4:45:05] <satiresatyr> so true
[4:45:07] <RushUnplugged> that's why Saint's Row is the best because he just plays himself
[4:45:16] <%AzureGale> It's the Nolan North effect
[4:45:17] <Mattais88> Right he's the voodoo villain
[4:45:23] <%hewlettfan96> keith david is the man
[4:45:25] <%cvp5127> neither does disney
