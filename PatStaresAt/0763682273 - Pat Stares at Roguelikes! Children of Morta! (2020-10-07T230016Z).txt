[0:18:01] <%shruke> Why aren't you playing a rouge in Baldurs Gate good lord
[0:18:02] <MattyValor> what type of game is this gonna be
[0:18:02] <drinkmoxie> Pat the snitch
[0:18:08] <%AnDyLV> a snitch is better than a criminal so...
[0:18:21] <+chkrailtracer> Pat joins a crime family and goes RIGHT to the cops. Immediately. No hesitation. Just kicks in the police dept's door with his stubby leg and spills everything
[0:18:28] <zamzoph> Dude, weed
[0:18:33] <+Taglog7> EVERYDAY
[0:18:38] <%goatbait> weed lmao
[0:18:43] <+BallerSwagBro9k> GET THE KIDS HIGH
[0:18:56] <%RyTYoung> My brother once told me to not tell my parents and the hospital that he was involved with breaking my arm and I finally told my parents after two weeks how; it was from hitting my head off a pull up bar when I was on my brothers shoulders, I was grabbing onto it and swinging and fucked up
[0:18:56] <%ClutchRoadagain> Hot box the kids
[0:18:59] <ShichiNoBushi> If my kid was paid not to snitch and snitched anyway, I'd give them a pat on the back.
[0:19:02] <+Dova573> really reasonable rule
[0:19:03] <+Taglog7> Do heroin
[0:19:03] <%Typhaeon> Very simple rules
[0:19:07] <%nofestu2> blow the smoke into the childrens face
[0:19:09] <%justinjones1989> Okay hear me out!..... Give the kids the weed!
[0:19:10] <+Dova573> like super reasonable
[0:19:11] <%TheWiggly> that seems to be the general consensus on parents and weed
[0:19:12] <@SoFarFetched> @shruke I mean he could almost be a sonic character Kappa

[0:19:56] <%ClutchRoadagain> It's that easy.
[0:20:03] <rcand9> big dumb energy
[0:20:12] <Psyramics> thats not stupid, thats apathetic
[0:20:17] <armchairmaster_> Don't do drugs, kids. Spend money on sex and videogames like a real winner.
[0:20:17] <MultipleJiggs> Punch the children. Got it.
[0:20:17] <@SoFarFetched> start banking some people?

[0:20:28] <%AzureGale> What a segue
[0:20:29] <rcand9> perfect child gets a 3080
[0:20:42] <%AnDyLV> ''get the iron punch glove hon , i have to educate these kids''
[0:20:43] <Make_me_mad> My brother, an adult, near-fatally electrocuted himself because a hacked-together welding device he was working on started to overheat, so he stuck it into a pool of water to cool it off. While it was active.
[0:20:44] <%gruff_gridof> you dont rule zangief with an iron fist @PatStaresAt
[0:20:52] <%devanmuse> it's actually called children of MORTA
[0:20:53] <Frostydough1> @PatStaresAt you literally tortured your ocd mother by moving her pictures slightly off tilt
[0:20:53] <Make_me_mad> Brothers are STUPID.

[0:21:07] <%StaceMcGate> your child Zangief rules you @PatStaresAt
[0:21:10] <%ExpressNode> He used his snitch money to buy a 3080
[0:21:13] <%ClutchRoadagain> I got lucky and my brother is a big powerful good lad who buys me lunch

[0:22:31] <%AnDyLV> most animals are better than most people u.u

[0:22:34] <+CannonHeroBrett> yes you can
[0:22:34] <+Kurt_0> Maybe 80%
[0:22:35] <+SilverDevilfish> Dog just wants to live a quiet life
[0:22:35] <%ClutchRoadagain> I would own a cat or dog over a child always

[0:22:51] <flatty1000> oh a dog can lie
[0:22:51] <%ssjklyco> A dog can only lie down
[0:22:53] <%ClutchRoadagain> But dog WOULD lie
[0:22:53] <BlacSoul> Dogs ABSOLUTELY lie
[0:22:53] <$sniffy77> Dog has no concept of lying.
[0:22:56] <%ClutchRoadagain> If they could
[0:22:57] <@commanderclaw> DOG IS EASY TO KILL
[0:22:57] <%Ranryu692> my dog totally lies

[0:23:17] <oniwahoo> @ballerswagbro9k Thanks for uploading those trash cast videos, those are great
[0:23:19] <Frostydough1> @commanderclaw SO ARE CHILDREN
[0:23:19] <+Dova573> That means you sucked at lying

[0:23:28] <Frostydough1> WAIT NO DONT PUTME ON A LIST
[0:23:29] <A_Cat_Herder> ***
[0:23:32] <+Taglog7> They just do the guilt face
[0:23:33] <%Bobbledygook> the closest dogs get to lying is feeling really bad and not making eye contact
[0:23:33] <+Dova573> You gotta know what to lie about
[0:23:37] <rcand9> lying rules and is fun
[0:23:39] <%Agami23> so the time before 14
[0:23:42] <+gustavozxd> atpFeelsBeardMan

[0:23:53] <%SirKeigan> Musta been nice. I miss hair too
[0:23:57] <%ssjklyco> I just think you looked the same, jsut smaller
[0:23:57] <oniwahoo> Pat: I bet I could kick a dog so hard, it would just explode
[0:24:00] <%rdark_ksu> as i got older I quit lying because i found if fucking tedious. i dont wanna keep a bunch of stuff stright in my head
[0:24:03] <EndgameContent> Can't stick around tonight but I hope Pat likes it

[0:31:02] <+michingmallecho> PS3’s Download store basically cobbled into the system. It’s dreadfully slow because it wasn’t built for the digital ps store. They definitely updated and made it better but it was still slow
[0:31:03] <%AzureGale> Could be the player trying to catch you up to the current moment
[0:31:04] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> I'm sure Elmo big mad pee everywhere two-person cleanup required
[0:31:11] <rcand9> the stream was prob catching up
[0:31:13] <@SoFarFetched> YEAh so usually best to refresh
[0:31:14] <%ExpressNode> Do you have playback speed above 1.0?
[0:31:18] <@SoFarFetched> if it gets wonky
[0:31:21] <%RyTYoung> @phrickshun It's fits very well with everyone
[0:31:32] <%Bobbledygook> man hope everything's ok
[0:31:38] <%StaceMcGate> is Pat killing the largest of bugs?
[0:31:45] <+mmack093> I hope everyone is ok
[0:31:50] <%Aarseth> Maybe Paige needs Pat's help setting up the 12 foot skeleton?
[0:31:54] <%Bobbledygook> Pat's killing a Mothra that got in
[0:31:55] <Phrickshun> @RyTYoung Yea, it's a good job
[0:32:18] <%stephaniesadgirl> Did Paige hurt herself trying to mount the 12 foot skeleton?
[0:32:24] <slix3431> Pat is now Skellmo
[0:32:26] <%sporeian94> sporeian94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! hey pat would you consider doing a phasmophobia stream for spooktober? it's a spooky ghost hunting game you can play with up to 4 people
[0:32:33] <chhdez> "Trying to"
[0:32:38] <drinkmoxie> I bet Paige hid Pats step stool and he can’t climb up on the couch again
[0:32:51] <smiggyballs13> SeemsGood
[0:32:53] <TheArrow_> now we're just bi ourselves
[0:32:53] <%AzureGale> Is pat saving saving the city as Patman
[0:32:54] <%Bailey__gaming> So what is children of MORTIS
[0:33:03] <%Aarseth> "Paaaaaat! I can't climb down from this huge skele-dong!"
[0:33:18] <%RyTYoung> Is the mould back? Ahti is gonna be pissed at Paige for eating it
[0:33:24] <+michingmallecho> I forgot Shadow of War was a 100gb download. God damn
[0:33:24] <%ExpressNode> Wow this must actually be serious if it's taking this long
[0:33:28] <%Profmcstevie> Paige is divorcing Pat, the large skeleton satisfies her mustard and skeleton needs
[0:33:31] <smiggyballs13> “Be right there, honey”
[0:33:31] <+Kurt_0> Zangief did a doodoo
[0:33:31] <%YakumoYomi> Phasmophobia even has VR support (wink wink nudge nudge)
[0:33:34] <%Bailey__gaming> @aarseth I heard that in her voice
[0:33:40] <$Afterman_> did paige eat something toxic again
