[0:19:45] <%Hilleltaco> Hilleltaco subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Hey, it's up to you whether you read this out loud or not, but as an autistic person, I really appreciated you taking a moment to separate that detail from the stalker story on the podcast. I don't think the intent was bad, but it still felt good to hear.
[0:19:49] <%Fooguwu> I still wanna push a Tim Rogers X Pat Fornite Fridays

[0:20:19] <%MisterRockett> A lot of the alternate outfits in that game terrible lets be honest. Mostly cause of the shit they staple to her forehead.
[0:20:19] <+Exicuren> I think at this point we should really ask why is Goku not in Fornite?
[0:20:20] <%ramielthe5th> who we playing with today PAt?

[0:20:41] <mortificent> Toei is shit
[0:20:43] <crowspeak> Why isn't Geno in Fortnite?
[0:20:45] <+MelodyMedley> It could happen?
[0:20:47] <%Hobojo153> Is Fortnite just a more legitimized version of all those flash Smash games
[0:20:48] <%Dakuu75> LOL to make it FAIR HAHAHAHA

[0:20:54] <%AzureGale> Why not add Ghost in the Shell to Fortnite
[0:20:55] <+LordAngry> But Goku could never die or get hit
[0:20:57] <%JoshManVGH> "oh no you shit me... I guess I lay down now?"
[0:20:58] <%ssjklyco> Pat should make an only fans, but it's called "OnlyPats"

[0:21:07] <%Dementedpenguin> whoa
[0:21:08] <+MelodyMedley> You did them all?!
[0:21:08] <+MayorRev> Mortal Kombat might show up in Fortnite
[0:21:10] <+BusterRepukken> why isnt Scrimblo Bimblo in Fortnite
[0:21:10] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> why isn't Genocyber in fortnite?
[0:21:12] <%valriot> Thats a really cool shoot
[0:21:16] <+LvckyLvc> God, I hope we get Vegeta with the Badman shirt as a skin
[0:21:20] <%VoidBaronJules> that's a sick chute
[0:21:23] <generalve> DID YOU FEEL GOOD BUYING THOSE V BUCKS
[0:21:27] <mortificent> Gundam will be in when the movie comes out

[0:21:35] <DianaTheAscian> damn mid jump
[0:21:36] <%justmildlilac> Gpttem
[0:21:37] <%AzureGale> Or Girls' Frontline
[0:21:37] <+BusterRepukken> BODIEDS
[0:21:41] <thelonechris> Fortnite is the purgatory that all rejected Smash fighters go to
[0:21:41] <%justmildlilac> *Gottem
[0:21:43] <%SteinsApprentice> ohhhh that was pretty good
[0:21:44] <%patriotrenegade> Aloy, BUT WITH A GUN.
[0:21:47] <+MelodyMedley> Owned right away
[0:21:50] <+Exicuren> yeyeyeye
[0:21:58] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> yeah fuck player 246!!
[0:22:09] <+MayorRev> @patstaresat are you making bank off the creator code
[0:22:11] <@commanderclaw> Boy do we
[0:22:16] <%Hobojo153> They get it real bad
[0:22:17] <%MisterRockett> Was that the first kill of the game????
[0:22:20] <iosephe> Yup
[0:22:21] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[0:22:21] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Why the Horizon Zero Dawn killing children in battle royale video game, papa?
[0:22:22] <Aydarkzero> oh man almost missed fortnite fridays!
[0:22:26] <mayormanders> so true
[0:22:29] <Mehless> horror movies be like
[0:22:29] <%JoshManVGH> Hardcore demonized
[0:22:30] <+MelodyMedley> Oh yeah...
[0:22:31] <%AzureGale> It's the internet, you have to be overly blatant and obvious
[0:22:31] <Aydarkzero> of course they have
[0:22:34] <$purifiedmadness> What? Who talks shit on Autistics?
[0:22:36] <%valriot> America demonised mental illness? Noooo, what, thats craaazy
[0:22:37] <Tracazoid> "You gotta mental illness, how can we fuck it up in media?"
[0:22:37] <+traximus_s> my dad has it
[0:22:39] <generalve> every hollywood writer thinks they are serial killers
[0:22:46] <$Ziegsy> Yup, I have paranoid schizophrenia and its.. yeah
[0:22:47] <Bathtub_Surfer> Where’s the lie?
[0:22:52] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt They did that in Heavy Rain right?
[0:22:53] <@commanderclaw> People don't understand that Schizophrenics are more likely to harm themselves than other people. They are just really florid when they do hurt other people
[0:22:54] <iosephe> Pretty much every mental disorder gets it awful
[0:22:54] <+vaderxyz1970> who's the guest tonight?
[0:22:55] <%VoidBaronJules> I really love/enjoy when you talk psych
[0:23:08] <+BusterRepukken> bodied x 2
[0:23:11] <+Promessa_EX> depression = school shooter
[0:23:13] <%BoxNavy> @purifiedmadness i mean, autism is used as an insult on the internet pretty frequently
[0:23:21] <+Promessa_EX> or so tv says
[0:23:23] <%justmildlilac> Ah, Pat being based once again
[0:23:32] <%Hobojo153> Are there even people without mental illnesses? Are there?
[0:23:33] <Bathtub_Surfer> atpQuan
[0:23:36] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @PatStaresAt Yo your maps exposed
[0:23:36] <Mehless> today i will agree with pat
[0:23:39] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I had depression and I didn't shoot up my school
[0:23:39] <%thelaxinator> meanwhile, many savants are made to seem saintly
[0:23:51] <%SABiscotti> I mean they probably had their reasons
[0:23:55] <codizle> Hey Pat, is being evil a form of mental illness?
[0:23:55] <redhotdivekick> yooooo pat rocking the evil within goo backpack
[0:23:58] <%psidefx> Right on time
[0:24:01] <thelonechris> There's some pretty fucked up people out there who act perfectly normal
[0:24:04] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> Noelle_of_the_Nova subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Hey Pat, I'm curious what you think of Apex Legends. Also one of my best friends have schizophrenia and yeah, he gets it rough and it sucks to see him have to deal with it.
[0:24:06] <@commanderclaw> Except self harm
[0:24:07] <%Dakuu75> oooh, ppl saying "we can see your map" because of stream-snipers
[0:24:10] <%walternatorz> but what about the fat evil?
[0:24:13] <%valriot> Mental illness is usually like, a modifier for people who already have issues
[0:24:15] <generalve> hey pat if you want to just completely stomp children in fortnite. just use a gamepad playing the mobile ports. you get such a advantage is baffling that its not banned
[0:24:30] <+Promessa_EX> i'm keeping up wth the 53+ part chris chan documentary
[0:24:30] <winner_92> no one will stream snipe pat because none of his viewers play fortnite
[0:24:32] <%Fooguwu> Behavior like that is it's own many-sourced mental illness though. Mental illnesses aren't really a binary thing
[0:24:39] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> juvenile delinquency?
[0:24:42] <%Daxalog> Kuno is real?
[0:24:51] <$purifiedmadness> There always has to be an out or something to blame. "That murder-rapist can't just be a piece of shit, he's gotta have one of these conditions!"
[0:24:55] <%Daxalog> The kuno is actually real?
[0:25:02] <%Hobojo153> Kuno *is* real, and it sucks
[0:25:05] <Zero_Jacks> Im glad i can learn something while seeing the same man stomp on some kids
[0:25:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> iirc, people with more serious mental illnesses (like bipolar and schizophrenia) are significantly more like to be the victim of a violent crime than a member of the general public
[0:25:18] <lemon_lover28> we should be able to spend channel points to make you chug 3 red bulls
[0:25:22] <+Promessa_EX> mental conditions are easier to write than a backstory
[0:25:40] <%Fooguwu> Pat is obsessed with and compulsed to MURDER
[0:25:47] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaMenace psaMenace
[0:25:48] <+mczarklesby> Yeah, Disco reviews were divided into people horrified at the possibility of Cuno, and people who knew a Cuno or were a Cuno growing up and were like "wait, you've never met this kid?"
[0:25:49] <+MayorRev> @generalve I think Switch players are matched with phone players, Switch port is essentially the same thing because of the touch controls
[0:25:52] <%Treuan> I hate when I do that
[0:25:56] <Zeif00> that's a zero dawn
[0:26:01] <+athuramn> I just joined, is he talking about his ocd
[0:26:06] <%valriot> I dont think that uncommon
[0:26:11] <%BoxNavy> nebulous anxiety monkaS
[0:26:11] <+RyTYoung> Shotty first for me
[0:26:13] <Mehless> you might be able to autosort the medicine in settings
[0:26:19] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt most players do that i think
[0:26:23] <%valriot> People just like menu order. Attaché Case go
[0:26:26] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I think most people like to have things in a certain order @patstaresat
[0:26:31] <%SABiscotti> It's what made RE4 have a secret minigame for only some of its playerbase
[0:26:32] <%Hobojo153> Well there is an argument that it makes doing the video game easier as you know exactly the button combo to get to it
[0:26:34] <%BoxNavy> monkaS !
[0:26:36] <+vitoxxi> hey this is a podcast by this point right?
[0:26:37] <%psidefx> LUL
[0:26:37] <Tracazoid> I don't even have OCD, at least diagnosed but I basically need to inventory tetris all my crap in RE4
[0:26:39] <%walternatorz> against children
[0:26:39] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:26:40] <Major_Lee_> The shotgun has to be on the 4 key for me in any game.  HL2 fucked me up on that
[0:26:44] <+MayorRev> I have rifle, backup, tool, meds, shields, for my usual arrangement
[0:26:45] <%ChestMimik> Gotta shoot them kids to prove youre not crazy
[0:26:46] <+Promessa_EX> untill those people on the sidewalk are just a bit out of place, and all i need to do is trun the wheel
[0:26:47] <+Joestar_SSB> I have OCD too, so I totally understand
[0:26:47] <%thelaxinator> Sort buttons exist to serve a function, not because of mind goblins
[0:26:48] <%twistedj3ster> Pat broke into my home and arranged all my socks
[0:26:49] <%JoshManVGH> Tim Rogers was talking about committing reverse crimes today.
[0:26:49] <%justmildlilac> @vitoxxi yes
[0:26:50] <lemon_lover28> I am gonna have to watch your disco vods, I haven't been keeping up with the steams because I am currently doing my first playthrough
[0:26:52] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> yo, where my crying babies at chat?
[0:26:53] <+LvckyLvc> Jeez, I unlock a random emote for 24hrs and of course it's the psaCrazy one
[0:26:53] <%AzureGale> Pat beats up children, news at 11
[0:26:56] <Zeif00> LUL
[0:26:56] <generalve> so a co worker stole 90$ bucks of my tip money this week. cameras caught him red handed
[0:26:59] <%Fooguwu> Violent tendencies or "being a dick" are just a mental illness we can't conclusively categorize
[0:26:59] <Aydarkzero> @vitoxxi yeah he pretty much said these are mini podcasts
[0:27:09] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> *crime babies
[0:27:09] <%BoxNavy> @DavidCrimsonHeidern yee but with ocd its more of an "i have to do this" as opposed to "i like it this way :) "
[0:27:09] <+MelodyMedley> Getting killed by wolves sucks
[0:27:10] <+BusterRepukken> raptors are even worse
[0:27:12] <+vitoxxi> cool
[0:27:17] <$realm_forge> I’m faaaar less inclined to forgive narcissistic types but that’s just me
[0:27:21] <julrave> is it weird that I have been looking forward to fortnite friday this whole week?
[0:27:22] <%MisterRockett> PAT STOP YOU'RE DESCRIBING ME
[0:27:29] <generalve> Hollywood writers fucking hates the mentally ill
[0:27:30] <$purifiedmadness> I know the legal process thing, but as we have seen over the last... long time... a lot of the time there are a lot of lies
[0:27:32] <+traximus_s> for me it's gun, gun, anything, shield, health
[0:27:39] <Bail_Seven> ever been tempted break into a store to rearrange the display stock?
[0:27:44] <$purifiedmadness> I phrased that terribly
[0:27:53] <generalve> and DAVID CAGE really mistreats them to the max
[0:27:55] <%Treuan> @julrave No, I've been waiting too. I'm in a weird spot where I want to watch fortnite but only when Pat is playing
[0:27:58] <@commanderclaw> @generalve Boy do they. It's obnoxious how hard script writers go on mental illness and how wrong they get it
[0:28:00] <%thelaxinator> A lot of fiction, like Heavy Rain, seems to posit that you have to be mentally ill to break the law
[0:28:03] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:28:08] <DianaTheAscian> DAVID CAGE
[0:28:11] <%ssjklyco> *couh* David cage *cough*
[0:28:13] <+MelodyMedley> Very true
[0:28:21] <Mehless> horror movies?
[0:28:21] <crowspeak> More than horror movies?
[0:28:21] <%blistexthief> Like how multiple games have the mentally ill shuffling like zombies?
[0:28:29] <Tracazoid> Yeah, games are pretty bad for mental illness representation
[0:28:31] <$purifiedmadness> Aw man Alzheimer's and dementia scare the shit out of ,e
[0:28:32] <%LonePlus_> wasnt hellblade super good
[0:28:32] <mortificent> hey remember Batman beating the shit out of those mentally ill people??
[0:28:35] <2DSuperiority> Go home Gamer Girl
[0:28:36] <reddpop_> SVU has got some doozeys
[0:28:37] <%Hobojo153> I think that's because video games (AAA ones anyway) are just bad about talking about shit
[0:28:40] <@commanderclaw> Crime shows act like mental illness is Warhammer Chaos Corruption
[0:28:41] <julrave> do you think Senua's Sacrafice is a good example of mental illness in the video games?
[0:28:43] <%AzureGale> What about Hellblade
[0:28:44] <+Delenay> csi did it too
[0:28:47] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt you should look at Omori, a game that is very good at looking at mental illness and depression
[0:28:49] <iosephe> Even when games want to get it right they...have issues
[0:28:49] <+MayorRev> @patstaresat what's your favorite weapon btw?
[0:28:51] <lemon_lover28> @2DSuperiority the classic
[0:28:51] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> hullo am david cage and I like to make the bad gems and make fun of people that I think are weeird
[0:28:52] <%shad8snake> man the evil within upsets me so much
[0:28:54] <+MayorRev> in FN
[0:28:55] <%blastyoboots> You're forgetting about SOAP OPERAS
[0:28:57] <thelonechris> Is it better than Civ 5 with Brave New World expansion?
[0:28:59] <%asgard147> So Pat, how's Fortnite treating ya?
[0:29:04] <generalve> @PatStaresAt pat do you like svu Ironically or unironically. its prob the biggest hit or miss show ive ever seen
[0:29:06] <+mental_mashup> yeah beat up the guy in straight jacket batman, best his depression out of him
[0:29:13] <winner_92> what do you think are the worst examples of games treating mental illness poorly
[0:29:16] <%psidefx> Same
[0:29:17] <%kyh9> Pat, talk about how good Falcon and Winter Soldier is with its character work
[0:29:17] <+traximus_s> blue AR
[0:29:20] <%valriot> Halo DMR Kreygasm
[0:29:22] <+MayorRev> P90 is rad
[0:29:22] <reddpop_> Calling people "H*\she" in the first episode. it got a physical reaction
[0:29:25] <%AzureGale> Assault rifles are p good
[0:29:26] <+MelodyMedley> Bows are pretty cool in the game
[0:29:27] <+Joestar_SSB> @blastyoboots YOU’RE RIGHT
[0:29:28] <%bustawof> explosive is so good when you get used to it
[0:29:34] <%bustawof> bow*
[0:29:35] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:29:51] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:29:53] <generalve> but ICE T thoguh....
[0:29:58] <%Treuan> nice
[0:29:59] <generalve> LUL
[0:29:59] <%thelaxinator> wow they had a longer run of good episodes than the simpsons?
[0:30:02] <Aydarkzero> 14 seasons seems pretty solid haha
[0:30:02] <%SteinsApprentice> no ice T
[0:30:04] <%blistexthief> Why does Meloni have all that cake?
[0:30:04] <%AzureGale> GOTEM

[0:30:09] <+traximus_s> the duelies when they were in the game
[0:30:10] <crowspeak> SVU X Fortnite coming soon
[0:30:11] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so whats gonna happen when a new season starts and they get rid of some of the weapons u like?
[0:30:12] <mayormanders> so true king
[0:30:12] <$purifiedmadness> In video games, some are more acceptable than others.  Like Dead Rising. I think the portrayal of mental illness is so outrageously cartoony that it's not even worth mentio
[0:30:14] <%BoxNavy> damn
[0:30:14] <%asgard147> But what about ICE T Pat?
[0:30:15] <%Treuan> Damn gottem
[0:30:15] <HitoBeat> Woooow
[0:30:16] <mortificent> is Chris Meloni with the big cheeks?
[0:30:18] <%psidefx> REKT
[0:30:21] <%walternatorz> how nice of them to give you a car
[0:30:21] <%the38bandit> is he on organized crime now? ive seen him in commercials
[0:30:22] <BlueLunecy> Sweet car
[0:30:24] <winner_92> @PatStaresAt what do you think are the worst examples of games treating mental illness poorly
[0:30:25] <+MelodyMedley> Putting Aloy and Lara in a season of fortnite with bows was a great idea
[0:30:27] <%AzureGale> LEVEL UP
[0:30:27] <%justmildlilac> If there's no Ice T, it's not for me
[0:30:29] <+Slushsoup> i'm still not used to this timeline of Pat the fortnite player NotLikeThis
[0:30:29] <dragoon001914> Finn and Munch were the better partner duo in SVU
[0:30:31] <$purifiedmadness> mentioning in the conversation of portrayals in medial
[0:30:35] <%JoshManVGH> Which one had Vincent DeNophreo?
[0:30:35] <mayormanders> omg double cheeked up

[0:30:55] <+BusterRepukken> @MelodyMedley theres a special vendor on the map that sells dual pistols if you wanna complete the Tomb Raider look
[0:31:01] <reddpop_> too close to home?
[0:31:05] <mayormanders> criminal intent was vincent
[0:31:10] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:31:10] <%SteinsApprentice> "gimme one of those treats... mmm"
[0:31:18] <$purifiedmadness> Boo

[0:31:37] <BurdRightsActivist> FLOATIN CAR PogChamp
[0:31:43] <+BigHooppaw> Stalking is not epic
[0:31:45] <+D00msDayDan> at least they're not a hive mind
[0:31:52] <%asgard147> yeah, that's kinda fucked
[0:31:55] <$purifiedmadness> Like the dude from 50 Shades
[0:31:56] <%AzureGale> Look at that tower growing
[0:31:56] <generalve> Pat do you think you would ever win games if you played with KB+M players ? i only ever won 4  solos in 18 months while consoles and mobile versions are cake walks

[0:33:53] <2DSuperiority> Uganda be kidding me
[0:33:54] <Aydarkzero> Black Panther has a cape?
[0:33:55] <%ItsCaptainDisco> ItsCaptainDisco subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! When will you get to play as a David Cage character in Fortnite?
[0:34:15] <thelonechris> Connor for Fortnite
[0:34:21] <%shurtal> @crowspeak that would almost be enough to make me start playing
[0:34:21] <%Bailey__gaming> so pat is ALL IN on fortnight eh?
[0:34:33] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah...
[0:34:33] <%TheShortSwede> TheShortSwede subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! 28 months that is more months than wins I have in Fortnite
[0:34:36] <%BoxNavy> not once has telling anyone about myself gone well
[0:34:42] <+BigHooppaw> Telling people you have schizophrenia makes those symptoms worse
[0:34:47] <broostmonkey> you can queue solo in Apex but everyone else will be in teams sadly
[0:34:48] <28moogles> Fortnite is great so it's fine.
[0:34:51] <+athuramn> people should hear things like that more
[0:34:53] <+MayorRev> @patstaresat You know about creator lockers? if you're a prominent Fortnite streamer you might get a loadout pack put on the store
[0:34:56] <%thelaxinator> Being visible doesn't mean people will accept you. Others might feel alienated
[0:35:00] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> This is Pat's new favorite game, confirmed
[0:35:05] <@commanderclaw> The part that kills me with Schizophrenia is people acting like you're going to launch into violence or a tirade at any moment
[0:35:10] <LeiaSkynoober> Hey Pat, I love you for this mental health talk. It's so so good. First and foremost, you should think about your own safety and comfort level with disclosing if you got something like that
[0:35:11] <$realm_forge> @patstaresat any insights on narcissism? This is fascinating
[0:35:13] <generalve> pat how much cash have you spent in v bucks now ?
[0:35:13] <+traximus_s> eww
[0:35:14] <%foxrock8> I'm so sorry Boxnavy
[0:35:17] <%shurtal> man, what if Enter the Gungeon crossover?
[0:35:19] <thelonechris> Brie cheese
[0:35:19] <%BoxNavy> thats a sick fuckin glider
[0:35:21] <Aydarkzero> ngl these fortnite streams are cozy
[0:35:23] <$purifiedmadness> I saw that
[0:35:23] <+MelodyMedley> Yep
[0:35:28] <+MayorRev> yep
[0:35:30] <DominoAxiom> Representation works better if you’re already famous
[0:35:34] <+alexanderthefine> ...I like brie larson
[0:35:36] <+Kurt_0> What if big mommy in fortnite
[0:35:37] <%Treuan> I got that pack, shrub guy was alright
[0:35:38] <KeiPrime> cheese?
[0:35:38] <Aydarkzero> wut
[0:35:40] <+BusterRepukken> I dont blame Brie Larson, Carol Danvers is just an awful character.
[0:35:41] <%AncelDeLambert> cheese?
[0:35:43] <KeiPrime> oh brie
[0:35:45] <+MelodyMedley> The car thing is pretty cool
[0:35:47] <$purifiedmadness> She only got in because of Disney
[0:35:47] <%BoxNavy> jermaVenus
[0:35:47] <generalve> Pogchamp
[0:35:49] <%Garthunox> no one joining you tonight?
[0:35:50] <+Valtorias> Quite comfy
[0:35:51] <+MayorRev> bush ranger
[0:35:51] <+athuramn> wow that's fortunate
[0:35:52] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Why, this is NO CHEESE WOMAN macawOmg
[0:35:53] <skyentombment> STINKYYYY
[0:35:53] <%xcompleasedad> That guy is MALDING
[0:35:55] <$purifiedmadness> Awwww sad for her
[0:36:00] <+LvckyLvc> I missed pat's RE stream yesterday, what was the Over Under on who'd be in the RE DBD chapter?
[0:36:05] <%baka_sugoi> FREE
[0:36:08] <generalve> did they get rid of the snake smote ?!@
[0:36:10] <Aydarkzero> OOF
[0:36:13] <+MayorRev> f r e e
[0:36:17] <%psidefx> Potate-oes
[0:36:21] <Aydarkzero> they are for sure mad
[0:36:22] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> IS Hellboy in Fortnite?
[0:36:24] <skyentombment> HOPS GOPS BGOPS
[0:36:27] <Qsmash_> why is she a 'cheese' woman?
[0:36:28] <VirtuaRailith> Everytime I watch Pat play fortnite, he has bought more skins
[0:36:30] <thatlolifrompersona1> What a nice skin does it support your code if I buy the $15 pack?
[0:36:31] <skyentombment> SKOPS BOPS
[0:36:35] <%Bailey__gaming> Zangief or Elmo Backpack please
[0:36:41] <%the38bandit> ever since civil war 2 carol danvers sucks, she even drags jessica drew down with her which sucks
[0:36:54] <%justmildlilac> @lvckylvc It's definitely gonna be Nemesis, imo. They make the most sense
[0:36:54] <+MelodyMedley> So do you think you can explain why you like fortnite Pat?
[0:36:56] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Hellboy would kinda fit in this art style
[0:36:57] <skyentombment> As Austin Eruption would say "Dat's what happen"
[0:36:59] <johnnycripple10> hallo
[0:37:12] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Civil War 2 was such a shitty cash grab
[0:37:15] <@commanderclaw> And doesn't wipe your inventory like Outriders
[0:37:21] <thelonechris> And you can floss
[0:37:28] <%thelaxinator> hate the fanbase if you want, but the game looks immaculate
[0:37:34] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat did u see falcon winter man this week?
[0:37:35] <Aydarkzero> has actual support
[0:37:38] <28moogles> I started playing Fortnite a week ago and I can't get enough. Turns out it's popular for a reason.
[0:37:39] <+MayorRev> he WOULD play apex if it had solo
[0:37:39] <Bail_Seven> tried speelbreaker yet?
[0:37:42] <winner_92> if apex had a generic pilot and solo mode would you drop fortnite for it
[0:37:43] <%twistedj3ster> HEARTBEAT SENSORS ARE THE DEVIL
[0:37:45] <$purifiedmadness> PUBG can eat my balls
[0:37:46] <dragoon001914> Call of Duty BR is also like 100 GB right?
[0:37:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Civil War 2 turned Captain Marvel into Captain Karen
[0:37:49] <2DSuperiority> I can't wait for the Final Fantasy 7 BR to feel like absolute shit
[0:37:54] <gothmanmothman> cannot believe how bad Pubg Boofed it lmaooo
[0:37:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Fortnite's only downside is that Epic is intensely evil
[0:37:58] <%Garthunox> and its like 500 TB
[0:37:58] <mr_mister0> F
[0:38:00] <%Treuan> I really struggle with the bow
[0:38:01] <%baka_sugoi> cod trash
[0:38:01] <%monsieurfantastic> monsieurfantastic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Orbmon. Thanks again for the REmarathon, love hearing you talk about the stupid ass RE lore. I tried watching the old mgs pp playthrough but i cannot deal with Liams gameplay. Any plans for a mgs marathon still? #whenspatstaresatREverse. Pet babies❤
[0:38:03] <generalve> bow is to weak
[0:38:03] <DominoAxiom> What about Roblox
[0:38:04] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Have you seen Invincible @PatStaresAt ?
[0:38:05] <$StrawberryPantsu> You watchin Invincible?
[0:38:05] <+glgzephyr> @the38bandit Man, I'm really glad I'm not into Marvel comics. Every time a fan speaks up it seems like they're complaining about something or other being ruined. I'm just over here enjoying the MCU having a good time
[0:38:06] <%justmildlilac> F
[0:38:09] <%Fooguwu> shoulda not used a bow at all
[0:38:13] <Aydarkzero> 3rd person is fun shooty
[0:38:15] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Is Birdman and Human Popsicle good this week?
[0:38:16] <ToneBacas> blame the skin
[0:38:16] <+MayorRev> Does PUBG still use stock assets? not to shame or anything
[0:38:17] <ToneBacas> Kappa
[0:38:18] <Aydarkzero> rip
[0:38:18] <+MelodyMedley> Got a quest done at least
[0:38:23] <%xcompleasedad> It is REALLY good.
[0:38:25] <Mattais88> It just doesn't feel like a third person shooter  anymore without cover shooting
[0:38:26] <thelonechris> Well then
[0:38:27] <morningmoondude> i tune in and you get 70, damn, you'll never be a proniteman
[0:38:28] <+Kurt_0> LUL
[0:38:28] <%shad8snake> Invincible is really good
[0:38:30] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Oh man, so good tho rgtSad rgtSad rgtSad
[0:38:42] <%asgard147> That's sad
[0:38:44] <+adamthreetimes> Invincible is great
[0:38:45] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> i cannot believe how cheap that game feels still
[0:38:49] <+MayorRev> ahahahaha
[0:38:51] <winner_92> pubg should have done so much more with the crazy money they made and they just didn't, so fortnite just wiped the floor with them
[0:38:53] <$purifiedmadness> PUBG is the single biggest fumble in the history of video games
[0:38:57] <+TheotherKristian> Just finished watching invincible, it's pretty good.
[0:38:58] <+LvckyLvc> @justmildlilac Yeah, that's what a lot of people have been betting on tbh, I wonder how his power would work, I hope he just says stars every now and again like Huntress' singing
[0:38:59] <+tempo__0> isn't pubg mobile literally the biggest game in the world
[0:39:02] <dragoon001914> There's nothing wrong with using store assets if the game is fun :)
[0:39:07] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> last time i played the lobby system was still completely broken
[0:39:07] <DominoAxiom> Have you seen Legion? If so, sorry.
[0:39:07] <%Bailey__gaming> Falcon and winty mam contains ample amount of boat fixing this week
[0:39:20] <Astrophizz> how's tomato town tonight
[0:39:21] <+athuramn> is this a skeleton halo man
[0:39:21] <%invalid_robin> Hunt is pretty good, and it looks great
[0:39:22] <winner_92> @tempo__0 even if this is true, would it be true if fortnite could legally be on iphones
[0:39:27] <masterfire23> totally accurate battlegrounds is the next BR
[0:39:28] <%Dakuu75> Question: is there a specific place to post Pat/Paige fanart? Like a reddit or something?
[0:39:28] <Octocon> what level are you in the battle pass?
[0:39:31] <%monsieurfantastic> psaDab psaDab
[0:39:35] <%AzureGale> mmmm, that smell. What is that smell.
[0:39:36] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Is it actually good, or is it at the bar this whole series has been at where it's basically just a 2000's action movie?
[0:39:36] <+BusterRepukken> Hunt games take forever to start though.
[0:39:37] <+D00msDayDan> mmm money
[0:39:50] <%the38bandit> i just hope hawkeye is good
[0:39:53] <+MelodyMedley> 93? Wow
[0:39:53] <28moogles> I still respect PUBG more than Fortnite since Fortnite just ripped it off but Fortnite is way more fun.
[0:39:55] <+Kurt_0> Triple A
[0:39:57] <winner_92> how much monster hunter rise have you played pat
[0:39:58] <$purifiedmadness> PUBG owned the market, and then tripped on their own dick face-first into a toilet
[0:39:58] <%invalid_robin> @BusterRepukken tru, but they are fun.
[0:39:59] <+JasonTheJazz> isnt PUBG story like League? League devs came from dota2 and PUBG from H1Z1?
[0:40:01] <%radda343> radda343 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! so how long until you're bigger than Ninja?

[0:40:22] <+MelodyMedley> Nice golden skeleton
[0:40:24] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Hawkeye would be good if they had someone more likeable than Jeremy Renner
[0:40:26] <%BigDumBeak> @PatStaresAt  whats the best cheese cuz i love gouda

[0:41:16] <28moogles> I find it so weird how most people never crouch walk in this game. A tiny bit of stealth goes a long way.

[0:41:20] <Superblooms> any interest in the STW portion of the game?

[0:41:27] <DominoAxiom> Did hunger games simulators start the battleroyale craze or did they exist beforehand?
[0:41:28] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> they ruined dad nier FeelsBadMan
[0:41:29] <ryman_official> that hoodie you're wearing makes it look like your torso has been chroma key'd

[0:41:36] <+JasonTheJazz> can I get any skin in this game without paying money?
[0:41:36] <+MelodyMedley> The bone crown on the skeleton is majestic
[0:41:38] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no Paige juice everywhere
[0:41:38] <%WhereIsWill> LUL

[0:41:54] <%MelBrooksKA> sipsipGasm skelmaton
[0:41:55] <%Dakuu75> @SoFarFetched Cool. Much thanks.
[0:42:06] <%ItsCaptainDisco> I just think he's not got the comedic chops for the series they're adapting. I hope they get Kate Bishop right tho
[0:42:06] <morningmoondude> CHUG JUG LIKE THAT MEME
[0:42:10] <+MayorRev> Gold pistol is quite good imo
[0:42:14] <@commanderclaw> Paige panik
[0:42:16] <%BigDumBeak> she can join on the couch though!
[0:42:17] <%Fooguwu> even worse than Woolie, somehow
[0:42:18] <%twistedj3ster> she would do the fortnite flip
[0:42:20] <%AzureGale> And yet you played outriders :[
[0:42:21] <%AncelDeLambert> her bones break because she drinks malk
[0:42:21] <$purifiedmadness> Who said she had to be good?
[0:42:22] <reddpop_> she got that chicken dinner
[0:42:24] <%Rumbutt> that makes it better Pat
[0:42:29] <+MelodyMedley> What are you hoping for with next season Pat?
[0:42:31] <%AzureGale> :p*
[0:42:32] <generalve> Are you planning on streaming the mass effect trilogy ?
[0:42:35] <%Bailey__gaming> I always try for 6 grenades and blue bow to make explosion bow
[0:42:38] <%the38bandit> that Matt Fraction run of the comic was pretty great
[0:42:38] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Is she worse that Woolie or is it around the same?
[0:42:42] <+kewlmyc> That was a child
[0:42:45] <$purifiedmadness> Wow

[0:42:52] <ToneBacas> how could you kill a walking christmas tree?
[0:43:08] <mortificent> ohhh Matt Fraction and David Aja's Hawkeye is one of the best mainstream comics ever
[0:43:09] <kylecorr> pat kills all of Christmas
[0:43:11] <DominoAxiom> When will you stop holding b and let Paige evolve into Book?
[0:43:12] <skyentombment> How goes the killing of shitchildren pat?
[0:43:19] <Reanimator83> Still can't believe she won a game of PUBG NotLikeThis
[0:43:24] <Fluffy_Tamamo> I see why Pat likes Fortnite now, these babies can't shoot for shit.
[0:43:30] <+MayorRev> how do you enjoy the new crafting? it feels kind of clunky to me imo
[0:43:42] <+BusterRepukken> @Fluffy_Tamamo until you run into the PC players
[0:43:45] <+MayorRev> feel about the new crafting, I should say
[0:43:46] <+withguac> Imagine if Pat encounters ninja

[0:51:46] <winner_92> seeing someone build like a huge tower in this game only to get blasted as soon as they peek their head out reminds me of that scene from indiana jones where he just shoots the swordsman in the face

[0:56:29] <skyentombment> I'm more or less disappointed this Raven doesn't have a massive ass/peepor like all the fanarts have
[0:56:32] <+BusterRepukken> Deathstroke is definitely gonna be a skin soon, he's in that Fortnite DC comic crossover
[0:56:33] <%MechArch> fuck em
[0:56:35] <DominoAxiom> They’ve been teen titans for decades now
[0:56:36] <%the22cstomp> mando was charging you with a pickaxe

[0:57:34] <winner_92> this directional sound option is really nice
[0:57:39] <Aydarkzero> when the movie comes out
[0:57:44] <%VoidBaronJules> and maybe a DC animated film and, forgot about the live action series
[0:57:53] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Has Pat met Ninja in game yet?
[0:57:55] <thelonechris> When they get the teleporting Mustang in FF10

[0:58:59] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> All carpenters must die
[0:59:00] <%MechArch> every time pat kills a child i imagine their soul disintegrating into the sky like shigechi
[0:59:01] <%asgard147> You ain't SHIT, elf limesGun

[0:59:22] <%Bailey__gaming> Pat is much better than I am 4 sure
[0:59:24] <%Taisuru> If you're playing on gamepad does fortnight match you with other pad players?
[0:59:35] <Major_Lee_> It is incredibly satisfying to kill a guy who built a skyscraper but cant aim for shit
[0:59:36] <thelonechris> It's like that part from Always Sunny where Mac and Charlie beat the shit out of those kids
[0:59:43] <AmericanaRed> actually....
[0:59:47] <+MayorRev> @patstaresat you hear what Takaya Imamura said about F-Zero? he said it's not dead, just "hard to bring back" without a "grand idea."
[1:00:02] <%Daxalog> Do you think youll try the League MMO? I expect it to be garbage on release. Like the fighting game will be.
[1:00:09] <skyentombment> @BusterRepukken My eternal hatred for the big 2 is rekindled once more
[1:00:10] <%AzureGale> Well done

[1:00:32] <DianaTheAscian> is Pat wiping out the tomato town?
[1:00:32] <rufus2k2> @MayorRev nice of a guy who doesn't work at nintendo anymore to comment on something he ain't in charge of
[1:00:34] <+athuramn> ah reloading in the open to lower the enemy's guard. good tactic
[1:00:34] <Mattais88> Who would have ever expected windows?
[1:00:35] <%stan4apples> So F-Zero is still dead then, got it
[1:00:37] <+MelodyMedley> fish
[1:00:38] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Isn't the LoL fighting game being developed by Arcs?
[1:00:43] <Clundy> League mmo? Wtf?
[1:00:48] <%BoxNavy> whos pat?
[1:00:48] <%WhereIsWill> are there no more flying shopping carts??
[1:00:57] <%Bailey__gaming> if I can be a temo I'll try league mmo
[1:00:59] <Reanimator83> Pat loves making kids cry
[1:01:01] <+BusterRepukken> yeah F-Zero is gonna stay super dead because Nintendo cant come up with a stupid periiphal for it.
[1:01:01] <$REDrder312> Does it help that the shot gun is good in fortnite because it is the grappler of guns
[1:01:02] <+MayorRev> rare chest near? :o
[1:01:08] <%invalid_robin> ... you're converting me god dammit, just downloaded the game
[1:01:10] <%Monkeyweed21> are you on the pleasent park streets
[1:01:12] <winner_92> @Clundy yeah people from riot talked about hiring people for one a while ago, it's confirmed to be in the works but it's very early
[1:01:15] <mortificent> I expect the fighting game to be pretty good, because they will have a good online interface
[1:01:20] <%BoxNavy> lemme be a yordle in the league mmo thats apparently a thing
[1:01:21] <%Mythicalbrit> @Daxalog MMOs not coming out for years also what makes u think both it and the fighting game will be bad? Lol is a good moba and LOR is a really good cardgame
[1:01:25] <+MayorRev> Harpoon + Shotgun is funny
[1:01:34] <+BigHooppaw> f-zero or kirby airride comeback plz

[1:02:13] <%Ozavic> Eating butter chicken and watching Pat murder children, what a good night
[1:02:29] <skyentombment> I like how the arrow waypoint gets a weird erection when you charge the shit
[1:02:34] <thelonechris> Wasn't Cyber Jason going to be in the Ft13th game before the IP owners killed it?
[1:02:36] <%VoidBaronJules> i feel like even if the league mmo and fighting games launch bad they'll get good in a single cycle
[1:02:42] <%invalid_robin> what's the creator code?
[1:02:50] <%AzureGale> Well done
[1:02:51] <%BoxNavy> yooo
[1:02:53] <skyentombment> Lot of work for a one-shot

[1:04:29] <ThirdPersonPhil> May the Fishier Net Wins!
[1:04:31] <+samsarasage> Yoooo Raven skin?
[1:04:34] <+BIumen> now woolie will play
[1:04:35] <%W1nterTitan> because of the short hair
[1:04:40] <winner_92> that popular skin looks like one of the valorant characters. raze i think?
[1:04:41] <@commanderclaw> Pat wouldn't cut an Avocado wrong, so he has that over Ninja
[1:04:44] <AmericanaRed> LEGGO X FORTNITE WHEN?
[1:04:45] <mortificent> Olivia Wild skin Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:04:48] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> OMG LARA IS SO HAWT, YOU GUYS Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:04:52] <%blistexthief> When are they going to add Juno and the burger phone?
[1:04:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat is tiny and small he would be devoured
[1:05:02] <skyentombment> @W1nterTitan Something something Woolie
[1:05:06] <Broken_Sonex> Short haired sci-fi woman. Woolie is hungry.
[1:05:15] <DominoAxiom> What if Daft Punk reunited but only for a Fortnite event
[1:05:23] <Major_Lee_> I hate the noise that chute makes
[1:05:32] <mortificent> When are they adding the Droogs from A Clockwork Orange??
[1:05:34] <%dork_doggler> any guest today?
[1:05:42] <winner_92> @DominoAxiom this is some monkey's paw shit
[1:05:45] <crowspeak> Brush your teeth and go to bed little Jimmy
[1:05:47] <thelonechris> I like that they went with this Laura rather then the torture-porn version
[1:05:57] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Olivia Wild from Tron is the closest Woolie can get to Dot Matrix, chat.
[1:06:03] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> That's how come the thirst
[1:06:04] <%Treuan> you do what you gotta do
[1:06:04] <+BigHooppaw> @mortificent That would be so powerful
[1:06:08] <+CaptainPyron> Man I hate the building in this though.
[1:06:11] <crowspeak> @thelonechris Both are in
[1:06:29] <+MelodyMedley> @thelonechris Well there's multiple Lara skin versions actually
[1:06:29] <+morphinepanda> pat wins build battles right?
[1:06:43] <%dork_doggler> @morphinepanda by shooting yeah
[1:07:06] <DominoAxiom> @winner_92 You know it’d be a lit event though
[1:07:06] <+BusterRepukken> @thelonechris There's  New Lara, theres Classic Lara Fortnite style, then theres PS1 lara that you see here
[1:07:29] <winner_92> @DominoAxiom if im being honest it would make a great skin
[1:07:36] <%AzureGale> There they is
[1:07:46] <skyentombment> My only actual gripe with fortnite is that it looks/created the trend of games having this weird, slightly grown up skylanders lookd
[1:07:48] <+CaptainPyron> I always get destroyed by builders with their half second of making a window, shooting, and closing it stuff.
[1:07:49] <Broken_Sonex> Wait i thought Lara was a boob lady. What's she doing with all this ass?
[1:07:52] <Reanimator83> If they added a mode without the building I would play the fuck outta this
[1:07:55] <DominoAxiom> Alive 2027 exclusively in Fortnite
[1:07:56] <+taren817> The thing is though, when will Pat get to play Aloy
[1:08:01] <crowspeak> What FF character do you guys see getting in? My money is on Squall or Noctis
[1:08:12] <+BusterRepukken> he already played aloy
[1:08:18] <DingasKhan> dude chug jug am i right
[1:08:21] <%VoidBaronJules> oh wow this sandwich is off to a bad start
[1:08:22] <+morphinepanda> cloud for sure??
[1:08:24] <winner_92> @crowspeak surely it would be cloud

[1:18:45] <+BusterRepukken> your foster parents are dead'
[1:18:51] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> What;s the matter with wolfie, mom?
[1:19:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Hey Pat, what's your least liked pizza style: normal style, New York style, Chicago deepdish, or Detroit deepdish?
[1:19:09] <MrChaosDoughnut> Oh no, puppies.
[1:19:10] <%JoshManVGH> Ive definitvley kicked Jonesys ass 3 times and I keep drawing and not getting the quest credit.
[1:19:10] <+kewlmyc> MY DOGS ARE HUNGRY
[1:19:19] <%AzureGale> All's fair in love and war
[1:19:26] <Aydarkzero> yep
[1:19:29] <+trackles_64> peeking is the worst part of fps
[1:19:32] <%AzureGale> Gotta download them in the moment
[1:19:40] <Aydarkzero> they can't help themselves sometimes
[1:19:41] <%WhereIsWill> pat with the STRATS....agaisnt 8 yr olds
[1:19:42] <burgerbeast53> hey man
[1:19:45] <Lancaster_H> its basically what counter strike is built upon
[1:19:49] <+BusterRepukken> @JoshManVGH yeah several quests are bugged
[1:19:49] <ToneBacas> @AzureGale even murder? monkaS
[1:19:49] <namisrot> they should do a fortnite crossover with dead by daylight i want to default dance as dwight
[1:20:01] <burgerbeast53> your really  good at fortnite
[1:20:03] <%MistyMntns> You should play Destiny 2 PVP with peaking
[1:20:13] <Aydarkzero> they are getting rid of sword peeking in destiny for pvp now
[1:20:21] <ToneBacas> you mean netcode in fps games?
[1:20:23] <%dork_doggler> well explain it to us
[1:20:24] <ferbeholds> i think its fine for that game
[1:20:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Siege is based around making holes in walls to peek
[1:20:26] <%Ozavic> Details?
[1:20:26] <%MistyMntns> You can still peak wtih  Emotes
[1:20:27] <Lancaster_H> oh yeah r6s has some disgusting peeker's advantage
[1:20:28] <%AzureGale> That is SUPER meta
[1:20:30] <+BusterRepukken> I only play Siege once a while, cant stand the community.
[1:20:30] <+RowenCleric> what about it? explain
[1:20:32] <DianaTheAscian> packing what?
[1:20:33] <$realm_forge> Destiny 2 pvp is a fucking nightmare full of god awful people
[1:20:35] <%invalid_robin> You would not like Hunt then if you don't like peeking. That game has so many little holes you can instantly just die through
[1:20:43] <Aydarkzero> any peekers? LUL
[1:20:44] <namisrot> peeking like looking around corners?
[1:20:56] <%invalid_robin> ahh that's lame
[1:21:01] <Aydarkzero> ye
[1:21:07] <+RowenCleric> ew
[1:21:11] <namisrot> ohhhhhh
[1:21:14] <+RedQueensAce> thats a thing in all fps games aint it?
[1:21:15] <%thelaxinator> Siege went to great lengths about it's hitboxes but it's netcode was awful
[1:21:19] <+trackles_64> its super frustrating
[1:21:26] <burgerbeast53> say daddy chill and I will donate $500
[1:21:31] <%thelaxinator> Also a few of the maps were terrible. Favela in particular
[1:21:38] <+athuramn> yeah, it's called peeker's advantage

[1:22:01] <Vortigon> mmmmmmoney
[1:22:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, peaking around corners/how fast your model appears from behind cover is highly dependent on FPS. Otherwise I see no major differences
[1:22:02] <linSP> do it no balls
[1:22:03] <CrimsonFox777> Give money or banned
[1:22:03] <Lancaster_H> @RedQueensAce yeah but r6's is exceptionally bad and it's a 1 hs with anything = dead game

[1:37:11] <MrChaosDoughnut> He Madoff with a lot of money over the years.
[1:37:14] <molens90> that's a common tactic amongst companies to keep people from getting paid more.
[1:37:18] <%Monkeyweed21> He ruin the retirement funds of countless thousands
[1:37:18] <+Veraverse> He did a Jeffreym
[1:37:23] <+CalicoKai> only reason he ever went to jail is because he was scamming rich people too
[1:37:24] <+glgzephyr> @BigHooppaw Compared to most of us, Pat IS rich. He's a HOMEOWNER
[1:37:25] <$RealThiele> this is his new car house
[1:37:27] <RyuuAoi> Probably fucked over your grandma.
[1:37:27] <%baka_sugoi> ded
[1:37:27] <+BusterRepukken> PC Player tried it

[1:37:53] <RyuuAoi> LET THEM BUILD
[1:37:53] <ThirdPersonPhil> All you need is Kill!
[1:37:57] <Sotetsu> If only there was a version of this game without the buildings.
[1:38:00] <%floniac> Lmao all that just to get shit on
[1:38:06] <%ssjklyco> Destruct, not construct
[1:38:06] <%baka_sugoi> just kill
[1:38:08] <kylecorr> child was trying to build pat a nice condo
[1:38:12] <%ashenfrenzy> i know building is like the unique mechanic but damn does it get annoying
[1:38:13] <coreroma> I see ur build and raise u a bullet
[1:38:15] <MrHeph> Fortnight is the only true MVC game right now
[1:38:19] <MrHeph> and that sucks
[1:38:19] <%dork_doggler> @Sotetsu buildings or building? i rather enjoy the buildings
[1:38:24] <thatsocrunchy> More like Bernie Made-Off with all your monies LUL
[1:38:25] <%Agami23> god damn. the news article that popped up when i googled who bernie madoff is. "bernie madoff died in prison, where he belonged."
[1:38:28] <%floniac> It’s always funny to shit on people that build like that
[1:38:28] <+CallmeLyra_> I'm surprised the cybertruck isn't in this game LOL
[1:38:31] <+kewlmyc> WAIT, NEYMAR JR IS AN ACTUAL PERSON?
[1:38:34] <Mudstone12> this sound desighn is satisfying as hell
[1:38:35] <%solracc25> Should have run you over
[1:38:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> Is it a unique mechanic or is it just a left over from some other game
[1:38:44] <+Veraverse> Neymar Jr is a football player
[1:38:44] <DrkJP520> What platform are you playing on?
[1:38:47] <+Veraverse> THE REAL FOOTBALL
[1:38:58] <+kewlmyc> Suddenly, I don't really care about unlocking him in the battle pass
[1:39:02] <RyuuAoi> @veraverse And he's hot
[1:39:07] <%AzureGale> Only weenies hide in bathtubs
[1:39:08] <$RealThiele> camping is too strong
[1:39:08] <+glgzephyr> yeah how dare people do the most natural thing there is to do in a battle royale
[1:39:08] <%dork_doggler> Didn't Bernie Madoff only scam rich people?
[1:39:17] <%twistedj3ster> it's smart not to cross Pat
[1:39:17] <+Veraverse> Is he tho?
[1:39:19] <%ssjklyco> When's Ellie for Fortnite
[1:39:19] <AmericanaRed> OWL2019200iq
[1:39:20] <+BusterRepukken> Bernie Madoff scammed everyone
[1:39:21] <Dommykins> audio storytelling
[1:39:22] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> But hiding in a house is basically all I do in real life! DO PEOPLE HATE ME???
[1:39:28] <$RealThiele> @dork_doggler also people with 401ks run by rich people

[1:39:38] <Ape_Law> I'm so mad that Pat is hiding in a house
[1:39:39] <+kewlmyc> I came from PUBG, so my main playstyle in this game is hiding in buildings.
[1:39:39] <ThirdPersonPhil> colapse their little fort
[1:39:43] <%dork_doggler> @dork_doggler oh okay that's bad thank you
[1:39:43] <Mattais88> Wall
[1:39:44] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Never forget that Bernie Madoff is partly responsible for the greatest sports contract of all-time, Bobby Bonilla; a contract that will continue to pay Bonilla $1.2 million every year until 2035, a full 34 years after he stopped playing baseball.
[1:39:48] <%Agami23> you should shoot out the base of his tower just to fuck him over

[1:40:11] <28moogles> Playing Fortnite like it's PUBG wins me a lot of games. Get loot, hide in houses, stealth up on people.

[1:41:44] <Octocon> rick
[1:41:44] <MrChaosDoughnut> I just hope both teams are having fun.
[1:41:49] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Don't believe it, chat. He's gonna go wipe more thoroughly
[1:41:52] <28moogles> @28moogles You're trying to kill people in both situations but sneaking up on someone with a shotgun is faster than a shootout.

[1:41:58] <Octocon> pat-rick
[1:42:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Gief has started licking his pepperonis, he's gotta get them out of there

[1:42:45] <%blistexthief> Twitter stopped being dead
[1:42:47] <StaceMcGate> Gief is getting as much use out of dem balls before they're removed
[1:42:47] <+BusterRepukken> so about that Shermie trailer
[1:42:47] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Is Gief's most prominent character trait sleeping?
[1:42:51] <%shad8snake> damn rip
[1:42:57] <coreroma> Dying to use the bathroom that is
[1:43:13] <+BigHooppaw> If we all peed at the same time, would the world flip up-side-down?
[1:43:16] <+athuramn> Gief's inland empire is like 20. Makes him tired a lot

[1:45:23] <%AncelDeLambert> good, once you start there's no going back
[1:45:23] <linSP> its amazing it only takes ONE scrap to ruin a dog forever
[1:45:24] <+BigHooppaw> That's honestly impressive af
[1:45:27] <dragoon001914> You mom is definitely going to give him table scraps.
[1:45:27] <%blistexthief> Is that a Suzi skin?
[1:45:27] <killswitchjohn94> How dare you
[1:45:28] <Meltgar> Gief will become BIGGER
[1:45:30] <+Ataraxis9> but he wants it
[1:45:32] <%Garthunox> make sure you show him pictures of your brother and train him to bite on command
[1:45:33] <%Monkeyweed21> you wont stop her
[1:45:33] <%walternatorz> if he gets any scraps, he will immediately forget all his training
[1:45:34] <%shad8snake> he'd become too powerful
[1:45:48] <+Catoclystic> What skin is this and is it available so I can start playing right now
[1:45:54] <namisrot> my dog gets table scraps at the end of every meal lol

[1:46:02] <%AncelDeLambert> alright, who put this boat here
[1:46:10] <%walternatorz> his entire life will be devoted to the food fairy that summoned food at the table in that one room
[1:46:10] <+Kenzo2000> He'll use the scraps to regenerate his balls
[1:46:13] <%Infernal_Dalek> Infernal_Dalek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Is Fortnite's performance really that bad on PC?? It doesn't look super demanding.

[1:46:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Is this the Suez Canal?
[1:46:30] <%BoxNavy> he will
[1:46:32] <%AzureGale> wat
[1:46:34] <Meltgar> Probably make GIef get food by doing his trikcs, but only small amounts, make the GIEF WIN the snacks
[1:46:36] <%BoxNavy> and when he does... monkaS
[1:46:37] <%AncelDeLambert> but what if he DOES, Pat?

[1:48:02] <namisrot> wh y is every woman in this game a pixar mom
[1:48:06] <Broken_Sonex> Beaten by BUMBA
[1:48:07] <Tracazoid> What about her SFV Alpha costume, she super thicc in that?
[1:48:09] <julrave> I wish she looked like that in Alpha
[1:48:11] <Octocon> she was 2d
[1:48:12] <%DedlokPM> I do
[1:48:13] <Sol_Install> if no blood then T most of the time
[1:48:14] <+DrTribal> no blood no cigars no cusswords
[1:48:17] <coreroma> Rated T for Thicc
[1:48:18] <%ssjklyco> This was before she had giant muscle legs in 4
[1:48:24] <crowspeak> Did that due donate 500 dollars yet?
[1:48:26] <+Kenzo2000> no blood and the bodies immediately disappear
[1:48:28] <Sol_Install> Alpha chun li is best tbh for design
[1:48:29] <%thelaxinator> technically you don't kill anything in this game, you just make them get teleported away
[1:48:30] <ergulor> Jill or leon
[1:48:33] <%BoxNavy> verdugo killer :)
[1:48:38] <Sol_Install> hate all other costumes
[1:48:41] <%the22cstomp> what if the map is the re7 house
[1:48:44] <+PkSilent01> The killer is gonna be Jack Baker
[1:48:49] <%Monkeyweed21> RPD would make a better map
[1:48:55] <%emperordread> Calling it: Map is first village in RE4, killer is burlap sack chainsaw man
[1:48:55] <+Fidranth> it's gonna be the re5 volcano
[1:48:59] <tukds> They would never
[1:49:00] <killswitchjohn94> You eliminate them not kill
[1:49:01] <+Shubreaker> killer is gonna b nemesis ez
[1:49:06] <$RealThiele> Leon and claire skins cause they always seem to be
[1:49:09] <Sol_Install> what if the map was just all the REs together
[1:49:12] <%walternatorz> what assets are the easiest to implement?
[1:49:13] <@Velyndra> killer is leon
[1:49:14] <%blistexthief> What if its lady D's closet?
[1:49:15] <%Monkeyweed21> MAYBE the lab from RE1
[1:49:16] <28moogles> they might do one from each of the first three games like silent hill
[1:49:17] <%emperordread> fair point
[1:49:21] <%AzureGale> We all know it would be Nemesis
[1:49:22] <%dj_xo98> Watch the killer be the ustanak LUL
[1:49:27] <%blistexthief> Hide under a pile of her coats
[1:49:27] <dragoon001914> The next killer will be RE5 Wesker
[1:49:28] <StaceMcGate> Make it Ivan to annoy Woolie
[1:49:28] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt would the rpd make a good map?
[1:49:31] <%saladin1911> It should be "Europe"
[1:49:31] <Aydarkzero> but if they used Mr Salvador he would have two chainsaw baldes!
[1:49:33] <s1rcuit> what about hammer dude from RE5?
[1:49:35] <+Delenay> is there someone with a tentacle grip like nem?
[1:49:36] <Sol_Install> @Velyndra Killer is the Boulder
[1:49:37] <ergulor> Uroboros wesker
[1:49:39] <DodgeJohnson> Watch the killer be Ustanak from 6 or something
[1:49:40] <TheHeroAppears> can't wait for jake to be the character Lappa
[1:49:41] <$RealThiele> if lady D is the killer people will come to you
[1:49:49] <%Pappajimbo> re5 boulder
[1:49:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Chris and Leon
[1:49:58] <%BoxNavy> fuck
[1:49:58] <illtima> Salazar as the killer or riot
[1:50:02] <%AzureGale> Leon and Claire would fuck?
[1:50:03] <ergulor> hahaha
[1:50:04] <%AncelDeLambert> good thing that chiyald can't aim
[1:50:04] <Tracazoid> Oh man, a Dead by Daylight RPD would be cool
[1:50:07] <Mattais88> Wekser would be a mold breaking pick
[1:50:09] <AmericanaRed> NO FUCK OWL2019Tracer
[1:50:13] <+NickHatesSnow> id prefer leon and jill
[1:50:15] <%Cn_alpha_02> What about Albert Wesker
[1:50:15] <PanicSwytch> What if its actually Lady Demiscu?
[1:50:15] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[1:50:17] <KeiPrime> its gonna be the ogrodemon from re6
[1:50:17] <coreroma> Yes, this is Fuknut
[1:50:22] <ThirdPersonPhil> Will he have a fucking bazuka?
[1:50:25] <Meltgar> Stream SNIPED LUL
[1:50:28] <+DarkShadow124> Did we buy Aloy?
[1:50:28] <%Infernal_Dalek> Really? Taunting an unarmed guy you shot in the back? I didn't know cops played this game.
[1:50:29] <MuffinMastr> at the end of the trailer i thought i heard a nemesis sound, like when he throws a punch
[1:50:31] <%shad8snake> wow they killed someone without a gun, so cool
[1:50:33] <StaceMcGate> Lady D is too new for a crossover
[1:50:45] <%AncelDeLambert> I feel like if you emote celebrate within the first five minutes you don't get many kills
[1:50:46] <tukds> Nyx Killer, Jill survivor, Re4 Village quote me
[1:50:51] <KeiPrime> the survivors will be carla radames and derek simmons from re6
[1:50:53] <%dork_doggler> plague of gripe's vomit?
[1:50:55] <Mudstone12> is it graunteed that fortnight players will mock you
[1:50:55] <%BoxNavy> ofgripes
[1:50:56] <%ChestMimik> Plague of Gripes?
[1:50:57] <%Deft_Thought> But what if its RE5 Wesker
[1:50:58] <28moogles> Elaborate but sounds fun
[1:51:00] <+Fadedblank247> watch it be the first two player monster, the ivans
[1:51:02] <%Daxalog> What will the tvirus do?
[1:51:10] <reddpop_> are you ready for Leon to fight Pyramid Head?
[1:51:10] <%Deft_Thought> And you get to zoom around the map doing his Rhino Tackle
[1:51:14] <%AzureGale> They gotta put Jill in there though
[1:51:19] <Octocon> thats too cool for dbd pat LUL pull it back
[1:51:20] <+LvckyLvc> The survivor's gonna be Steve
[1:51:22] <namisrot> t virus could give hinderd effect
[1:51:23] <someyounguy1> wow its busy round here
[1:51:25] <%BigDumBeak> @PatStaresAt survivor is chris and the monster is giant boulder and he punch it
[1:51:29] <%thelaxinator> it had a similar effect in outbreak
[1:51:36] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe the G parasites from 3
[1:51:41] <RaidenRising> plague of gripes vomit ?
[1:51:42] <%AzureGale> X gon' give it to you
[1:51:44] <someyounguy1> its gotta be nemesis right? hes the grosser villain
[1:51:45] <$RealThiele> "Give it to ya"
[1:51:46] <KeiPrime> its gonna be forrest from re1
[1:51:46] <28moogles> There's too many dash killers already, your Nemesis idea sounds better
[1:51:47] <+Kenzo2000> What about the guy from 5 who turns into a whale. He turns into the whale and crushes everyone on the map
[1:51:50] <%valriot> What if its Wesker? LUL
[1:51:52] <StaceMcGate> how about Jack Baker with a shovel
[1:51:55] <+puffinup> breaks obstacles maybe?
[1:51:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Mr X would move slower but not flinch from pallets and break them faster
[1:51:59] <%JoshManVGH> What if it ends up being Salazar
[1:52:00] <XelanArdel> what would be the worst picks for the dbd crossover
[1:52:06] <%thelaxinator> I never understood why lying down on the ground in outbreak made your virus count skyrocket
[1:52:06] <+LvckyLvc> I'd love for the killer to be Wesker with teleport dash
[1:52:08] <corepercentlives> plague vomits covers you in sexy flurries suffocating you
[1:52:13] <+Shubreaker> why do all the players have bot names
[1:52:15] <+Svennigan> The killer should be Salazar lmao
[1:52:15] <coreroma> Clearly Chris turns into a werewolf and is the final boss.
[1:52:15] <%AncelDeLambert> is it possible to pancake into the ground?
[1:52:17] <RaidenRising> re6 china and ustankd
[1:52:18] <tukds> Wouldn't it be similar to silent hill where multiple games got representation for each killer survivor and location given?
[1:52:20] <someyounguy1> we live in a fortnite society
[1:52:21] <intestinal_bleeding> joemker
[1:52:21] <%BoxNavy> jokaire
[1:52:24] <+BusterRepukken> you live in a fortnite society
[1:52:26] <KeiPrime> the killer is gonna be a gamma hunter and it eats you
[1:52:27] <%AzureGale> Worst would be that dude from RE6
[1:52:35] <DrStinkers> @Shubreaker  streamer mode
[1:52:47] <Ravioli_Ronin> Jo-car
[1:52:53] <crowspeak> Melvin Brother of the Joker
[1:52:53] <+BigHooppaw> Pat has three balls confirmed
[1:52:55] <Broken_Sonex> That does look like a Society, yes
[1:52:58] <Mr_Ease> that wasn't very pleasant at all
[1:53:07] <Mudstone12> confirmed pat has taken in his dogs balls for more balls
[1:53:13] <+DarkShadow124> Pat so good now
[1:53:15] <someyounguy1> oh you can kill 1 RE boss now
[1:53:18] <%AncelDeLambert> VROOOOOOOOM
[1:53:19] <%saladin1911> Did he not hit you once?
[1:53:20] <coreroma> Whoever gets the most balls, wins Fortnut
[1:53:23] <Meltgar> ROCKET
[1:53:25] <+max_radical> these dudes are dying so quick, has the TTK in fortnite always been so low?
[1:53:39] <%thelaxinator> Are chests client-side? Why did they open that one?
[1:53:40] <killswitchjohn94> Double shotty ayoooooooo
[1:53:40] <+CelioHogane> @max_radical yes
[1:53:47] <+BusterRepukken> Pat when will Shermie be real
[1:53:49] <KeiPrime> with no shields, you die quick
[1:53:53] <Mattais88> Worst pick would be Ehthan as survivor, Eveline as Killer, and Racist Africa town as map
[1:53:56] <+LvckyLvc> OK real shit, what would ANY of the RE DBD perks be ?
[1:53:57] <Meltgar> Why are there respawn vans when it's SOLO's?
[1:54:02] <StaceMcGate> Pat is legitimately becoming a pro-fortnite player huh
[1:54:06] <onlydonsilva> Double shotgun is not a thing
[1:54:09] <%AncelDeLambert> what kind of weird Genji elf is Pat playing?
[1:54:10] <thatsocrunchy> Tree always wins
[1:54:10] <MuffinMastr> feels like every game is shotgun meta rn..
[1:54:10] <%baka_sugoi> RPG THAT CAR
[1:54:18] <Octocon> is pat getting hit by stream snipers??
[1:54:26] <$RealThiele> rip that guy

[2:00:24] <DianaTheAscian> that looks like a bug

[2:16:30] <%darklordfodder> Kino is definitely new to North  America...
[2:16:31] <%Skelefellah> The language is being patched as we speak with new words
[2:16:32] <%thelaxinator> Kino means "high class art for a niche audience"
[2:16:32] <TheHeroAppears> I love all the answers saying it's different things
[2:16:34] <%Daxalog> Its just another way of saying good or cool
[2:16:35] <ShinChris> it's 4chan slang for a good movie, something critically acclaimed
[2:16:38] <%blistexthief> It's all made up words, do whatevs
[2:16:38] <RyuuAoi> Why is based good?
[2:16:50] <%MelBrooksKA> Based is like a million years old, they were saying that when I was in highschool

[2:17:46] <linSP> baste
[2:17:47] <%DedlokPM> Based is based on being based.

[2:17:54] <mrlastchance1> what do you think shield pot tastes like?
[2:17:55] <+MayorRev> "Based" i think Lil B described was "being happy with yourself and doing what you want
[2:17:57] <%AncelDeLambert> You're not based, you're alkalined
[2:17:57] <KeiPrime> language is malleable
[2:17:58] <coreroma> Based on Rap Lore G
[2:17:59] <tukds> meaning is decided by the collective conscious if he put it out there and everyone accepted it then that is what based now means
[2:17:59] <%blistexthief> Wait, Woolie is hip, he'd know
[2:18:03] <cis_eraser_420> @Skelefellah i mean tbh english is one big incremental patch lmao

[2:18:56] <%Deft_Thought> Tastes like a blue quarter-water from a bodega
[2:18:56] <fritz_dacat> Like a snowcone with not real flavor
[2:18:59] <%Monkeyweed21> It tastes like Vergil's lips
[2:19:00] <%Emperor_Machinus> Delicious delicious coolant fluid?
[2:19:01] <+MayorRev> Do you still drink purple btw?

[2:20:19] <%Skelefellah> People are more than willing to help people out in the community, so always ask if you're curious.
[2:20:21] <%Monkeyweed21> do the story and any quest with a blue +
[2:20:23] <+StickonATree> and do your job quest when available
[2:20:25] <$RealThiele> also if you want the real answer say the wrong one really loud
[2:20:26] <%dork_doggler> @MayorRev i think it makes the sound mono instead of stereo
[2:20:27] <%ElkRiverDog> And everyone calls cling wrap seran wrap

[2:25:47] <+dereksbales> you two are made for eachother
[2:25:48] <%Deft_Thought> While I'm sure there's truth in that, Pat is also a crazy person
[2:25:52] <+DynDimAcsiwn> subsistence came after
[2:25:53] <%twistedj3ster> Oh not this again

[2:26:12] <$RealThiele> Style goblin vs number goblin
[2:26:12] <%twistedj3ster> twelve years for Death Note
[2:26:13] <Brandon__Brando> stonks
[2:26:15] <%Monkeyweed21> 12 years
[2:26:17] <Meltgar> Huh....... Is it why the let's play was a little bit late?
[2:26:21] <%Skelefellah> 'But it's hype now, striking while the iron's ice cold'
[2:26:22] <@commanderclaw> A child is in middle school that was born after that game
[2:26:24] <%Boxortoo> LOL
[2:26:25] <%ChestMimik> He has played Hollow Knight, right?
[2:26:25] <%Boxortoo> holy shit
[2:26:26] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Dammit Pat stop setting off my Google 🤣
[2:26:27] <MuffinMastr> oof. 1 shot
[2:26:27] <tukds> but fighting games though
[2:26:27] <%batpick> It's a matter of principle for him.
[2:26:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Asylum is so damn good I love it so much
[2:26:28] <+kewlmyc> DIE ANIME
[2:26:28] <+traximus_s> oof

[2:26:30] <DazzlingFuhrer> DUNKED

[2:26:32] <Meriokingston> DAAAAMN
[2:26:32] <RyuuAoi> Didn't he hit DS2 pretty late?
[2:26:32] <%AzureGale> CLEAN KILL
[2:26:32] <+Itselguapo> YOU NEVER PLAYED ARKHAM ASYLUM?!
[2:26:34] <%Boxortoo> That person got fucking deleted
[2:26:34] <+MayorRev> it took him 12 years to m ake!
[2:26:34] <%MisterRockett> He doesn't really like shooters so without a specific hook to draw him in it's probably gonna be a while. Something being GOOD isn't enough it has to appeal to his specific interest.
[2:26:35] <%Taisuru> pop
[2:26:35] <%baka_sugoi> psaDab evo15MindBlown sbfpSetIn sipsipDab
[2:26:36] <%thelaxinator> you bipped that guy
[2:26:37] <+polothegreatest> chat gave woolie bad tips
[2:26:38] <Lancaster_H> "played" is a strong word
[2:26:41] <xxshadowxx416> @lancaster_h  it would be woolie first
[2:26:43] <Meltgar> GOD DANG
[2:26:46] <%AncelDeLambert> and that principal is Skinner
[2:26:50] <TheHeroAppears> CasteSuperBeast the only podcast where neither of the hosts have seen deathnote
[2:26:50] <+MayorRev> it took him longer than it took to make the GREAT WALL OF CHINA-
[2:26:53] <Broken_Sonex> He's such a stubborn guy.
[2:26:58] <+BusterRepukken> the shockwave stuff is the worst in this game
[2:26:59] <%MisterRockett> ???????
[2:27:02] <+BigHooppaw> hes worried he will have fun
[2:27:02] <Meltgar> LOL POPPED
[2:27:05] <+BusterRepukken> people abuse it so hard
[2:27:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie never beat the White Palace or Radiance tho
[2:27:06] <%MisterRockett> Where the hell did he go?
[2:27:07] <%AzureGale> At least they're not killing you
[2:27:13] <$RealThiele> joestar secret technique
[2:27:13] <KeiPrime> it took 12 years to make
[2:27:14] <+DrTribal> he shot through the roof
[2:27:17] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> @BigHooppaw Fucking BINGO
[2:27:18] <%Taisuru> Can someone explain what just happened?
[2:27:20] <tukds> Half life was even longer
[2:27:21] <@commanderclaw> He waited until it had ages poorly
[2:27:27] <coreroma> Ninja Vanish
[2:27:31] <%Skelefellah> Woolie fears progress sometimes, but in other times he's trying too hard to be ahead of the curve
[2:27:33] <%Skelefellah> It's amazing
[2:27:35] <%thelaxinator> but teppen though
[2:27:36] <vile_brand> he might have forgot for most of that time
[2:27:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie did the Halo series LAST YEAR
[2:27:38] <choopercabra> Maybe he just didn't care about Batman?
[2:27:40] <Ravioli_Ronin> Why is the menu UI So goddamn atrocious
[2:27:40] <+YharnamNighthawk> @PatStaresAt funny enough, last night I was listening to the clip where you were giving him shit for not playing it
[2:27:41] <thatsocrunchy> This skin just infuriates me every time I look at it
[2:27:42] <T_Sasquatch> Woolie is "busy"
[2:27:44] <marvel877> He waited 2 decades for Half Life 1.
[2:27:44] <%ChestMimik> Wasn't part of the reason he played it at all was Disco taking a while to patch?
[2:27:46] <+dereksbales> 20 years to play halo
[2:27:49] <ferbeholds> @Skelefellah true
[2:27:51] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, that's Woolie all right
[2:27:53] <%Gogogolem> Its the hipster in Woolie.
[2:27:53] <%MisterRockett> Watching him play AA it seems to be that he actually hasn't watched/read a lot of Batman xD
[2:27:54] <xxshadowxx416> patstaresat played halo 21 year later
[2:27:54] <%Taisuru> He's a hipster this is known
[2:27:55] <%BoxNavy> ehhhh im the same way in that regard. theres no rush.
[2:27:56] <Jrocy247> FIGHTING GAMES
[2:27:57] <%VoidBaronJules> but the court of owls teasers
[2:27:59] <%SirGO0SE> he's just being kind and letting us play the games first :)
[2:28:01] <%blistexthief> But fighting games tho
[2:28:07] <+DrFacilier> lmao good times
[2:28:07] <Devbob98> I hope he never plays city tbh
[2:28:09] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will NEVER get to Yakuza 6
[2:28:09] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[2:28:11] <%weissguard> Yeah, that clip was great
[2:28:11] <+JasonTheJazz> THATS MY FAVORITE CLIP
[2:28:11] <%thbluewarden> Yeah that one of my favorite clips
[2:28:11] <vile_brand> you mean the single most infamous clip ever?
[2:28:11] <dragoon001914> Man that was a great bit
[2:28:11] <%thelaxinator> teppen has a few jpgs that he likes and it consumed his life
[2:28:14] <%AzureGale> LUL
[2:28:15] <DrkJP520> That's a great podcast moment
[2:28:19] <%Dakuu75> good times
[2:28:19] <Broken_Sonex> "I'm busy, doing nothing guys." @PatStaresAt
[2:28:22] <%Fooguwu> not having played Hollow Knight yet is a bad one
[2:28:23] <%saladin1911> To be fair, sometimes that just happens. Plenty of classics that I'm sure we've all missed
[2:28:27] <%Taisuru> Pat just present fortnight as if it was fighting games
[2:28:27] <%MelBrooksKA> Yeah, but you were being that guy
[2:28:27] <+DrTribal> @Taisuru he used a jump grenade and shot through the roof. It breaks walls as you fly.
[2:28:30] <%MisterRockett> That was a good burn on you at the time but you've become retroactively justified in you befuddlement.
[2:28:30] <tukds> You never watched the Netflix movie!?
[2:28:31] <%Skelefellah> He lives a very strange counter-intuitive life sometimes
[2:28:31] <coreroma> Woolie likes retro games, even if he has to wait for it to become retro!
[2:28:32] <%dork_doggler> I honestly don't "get" that clip
[2:28:32] <+MayorRev> ahahaha yessss
[2:28:34] <KeiPrime> to be fair, PAt was RIGHT to do that
[2:28:34] <Qsmash_> woolie waits until the hype dies down b/c he doesn't like hopping on "popular thing" is my guess
[2:28:36] <+MayorRev> the bullseye
[2:28:42] <marvel877> When's the RE2 Remake Claire B run going to happen for Woolie?
[2:28:45] <%thbluewarden> You Haven't seen death note!?
[2:28:49] <ergulor> is this the stinks man?
[2:28:50] <%Boxortoo> LOL
[2:28:51] <xxshadowxx416> @blistexthief is fight game food
[2:28:52] <%dork_doggler> I think Woolie is just an enormous hipster
[2:28:53] <+skeletonmilk> @PatStaresAt who has a cuter belly: zangief or elmo?
[2:28:54] <$RealThiele> EAT YOUR GREENS WOOLIE
[2:29:00] <RyuuAoi> Love going back to old podcast. Podcast should stay five hours long. It's bitter sweet. I go through a lot of good memories!
[2:29:00] <%Dakuu75> only option is to keep quiet about it
[2:29:01] <%ChestMimik> ALL of my friends are like that, goddamned Fate
[2:29:01] <+polothegreatest> got s8 pat
[2:29:02] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Woolie is a particular type of annoying that i hate.
[2:29:06] <%Taisuru> @Taisuru That sounds extraordinarily annoying to deal with
[2:29:07] <+kewlmyc> I know that feeling
[2:29:11] <%psidefx> I know that all TOO well
[2:29:17] <ThirdPersonPhil> I have a friend that refuses to watch "western anime" and i will never be able to make him watch Avatar
[2:29:17] <KeiPrime> You can lead a horse to water, man
[2:29:21] <%weissguard> Honestly, with how Woolie will "eventually get around to things", it baffles me how he'd even think doing that Yakuza 7 thing was a good one. He went from 0 to 7 with no inbetween.
[2:29:22] <+BusterRepukken> @Broken_Sonex bro chill
[2:29:25] <vile_brand> saw that clip
[2:29:25] <%Skelefellah> Pat, there's no reasoning with a mind that's ever-against its own preferences and ideas
[2:29:28] <%AncelDeLambert> you mean the best boss fight of the genre?
[2:29:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat woolie has to stop playing Yakuza 7 so he can stream CVS Chaos
[2:29:38] <Mattais88> You won't watch Attack on Titan but you watched every Fate sreies?
[2:29:39] <radiosanchezz> how are you getting so many gold bars? i'm struggling keeping over 1000
[2:29:39] <%AzureGale> Mr. Freeze is like one of the best bosses in videogames
[2:29:44] <%twistedj3ster> that Beyond suit DLC was amazing
[2:29:44] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt Thinking about it, you would consider Woolie the Fighting game guy, what about you pat? FPS's?
[2:29:45] <tukds> Woolie HATES "spiolers"
[2:29:50] <+MayorRev> Don't be afraid to use dumpsters or porta pottys btw, they do make noise sometimes but players are too stupid to notice ngl
[2:29:52] <Devbob98> It’s wild Woolie is surprised by spoilers from a decade ago
[2:29:54] <marvel877> And he's getting upset about SPOILERS.
[2:29:56] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a lolno moment
[2:29:56] <@commanderclaw> It's been 8 years Woolie!
[2:29:57] <%AzureGale> wtf
[2:29:57] <%ChestMimik> @Mattais88 OH MY GOD tell me about it
[2:30:01] <DianaTheAscian> yeah he did that
[2:30:02] <%Skelefellah> It's old enough to talk about freely.
[2:30:03] <%Taisuru> Woolie is WAY crazier than pat it's just that pat SOUNDS crazier
[2:30:03] <choopercabra> Hes never going to play Arkham city
[2:30:04] <marvel877> FREEZE WAS IN THE TRAILERS.
[2:30:05] <%MisterRockett> You fight MR. FREEZE IN A BATMAN GAME?!?!?!?!
[2:30:06] <%VoidBaronJules> it was spoiled in trailers trho
[2:30:08] <+kewlmyc> Woolie's definition of "spoilers' baffles me
[2:30:12] <Meltgar> Woolie will perfect parry you if you use spoilers Kappa
[2:30:12] <Drivershaft> thats like saying "you spoiled this monster from monster hunter 2 for me"
[2:30:15] <%radregice> i feel like just hearing about it is different than seeing or playing it
[2:30:17] <Tracazoid> He did manage to avoid the shitty Asylum Joker fight for 10 years somehow
[2:30:17] <RyuuAoi> Pat used to be BAAAD with spoilers back in the day Tho!
[2:30:19] <%LeiaSkynoober> @weissguard He got sponsored to do Yakuza 7 which tbh, super fair
[2:30:24] <%thelaxinator> Woolie just explained on one of his streams that he intentionally doesn't pay attention when talking about a game he hasn't played, to avoid being spoiled
[2:30:24] <+traximus_s> and he's never going to get to it
[2:30:27] <marvel877> FREEZE'S IN THE TRAILERS.
[2:30:28] <KeiPrime> you mean KHEZU in MHRISE?
[2:30:31] <+DynDimAcsiwn> it's one of the most talked about fights in the franchise
[2:30:35] <+polothegreatest> batman origins is good
[2:30:35] <%Boxortoo> LOL
[2:30:35] <%AncelDeLambert> friendship over
[2:30:37] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:30:43] <%Boxortoo> That's hilarious
[2:30:44] <%snackcanary> he already knows the biggest spoiler, which is who's the villain in  Knight.
[2:30:45] <%BoxNavy> YOU BITCH!
[2:30:45] <Meltgar> "YO, BATMAN IS BRUCE WAYNE?!"
[2:30:46] <crowspeak> YOU BITCH
[2:30:47] <$RealThiele> SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE
[2:30:49] <+NickHatesSnow> LUL
[2:30:50] <dragoon001914> Yeah but Harry Potter is bad
[2:30:51] <crowspeak> YOOOOU BITCH
[2:30:52] <%Deft_Thought> IT'S DIFFERENT! He doesn't CARE about Harry Potter!
[2:30:53] <%AzureGale> But Woolie doesn't give a crap about Harry Potter
[2:30:56] <%Boxortoo> I fucking remember that shit
[2:30:57] <%VoidBaronJules> oh god, thats not a good look
[2:30:58] <%Boxortoo> That was hilarious
[2:31:00] <cis_eraser_420> lmao
[2:31:01] <tukds> We make our own rules
[2:31:01] <Devbob98> Woolie is getting old
[2:31:04] <Mattais88> Wait that's where "You BITCH" comes from/
[2:31:06] <$RealThiele> but if doesnt affect ME
[2:31:08] <%baka_sugoi> LUL LUL LUL
[2:31:09] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> Woolie contains multitudes
[2:31:10] <KeiPrime> YEah its funny when its NOT YOu
[2:31:11] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt He's changed a lot man.....
[2:31:13] <+dereksbales> it only feels good to be the bully
[2:31:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Harry Potter's pretty bad in retrospect
[2:31:13] <Sol_Install> I stop caring for it
[2:31:19] <gitdweezzy> i love that clip
[2:31:24] <%Taisuru> The line is this circle around myself
[2:31:24] <RyuuAoi> Chocking. Dying. Ha awe Woolie
[2:31:24] <+MayorRev> funnier when it happens to other people
[2:31:25] <%Fooguwu> woolie is not a smart man
[2:31:26] <+BigHooppaw> say something nice about the man
[2:31:26] <Mr_Ease> okay but thats because its legitimately one of the funniest videos of all time
[2:31:27] <%AzureGale> Welcome to Castle Boomer Beast with Boomerie and Boomerat
[2:31:27] <%Skelefellah> He's always in a state of conflicting thoughts that both do and don't rep him - it's a fun thing to see sometimes
[2:31:37] <+BusterRepukken> people in chat are taking your woolie stories a bit seriously
[2:31:40] <%Boxortoo> I don't mind harry potter but I'll be the first to admit it's fuckin' aged like garbage.
[2:31:44] <+ClickyButtons> wait is that the stonks guy?
[2:31:45] <+JustToWatch> Pat, you're forgetting the basic principal. Tragedy is when I stub my tow, comedy is when you fall in an open sewer and die
[2:31:50] <Lancaster_H> spidey in mcu thing
[2:31:51] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Is sleeping in trash another Harry Potter reference?
[2:31:51] <%AzureGale> 13 Sentinels
[2:31:56] <%VoidBaronJules> that was baffling
[2:31:59] <DazzlingFuhrer> I thought you meant the actual civil war for a second.
[2:31:59] <%ChestMimik> DON'T TELL US SPIDER MAN IS IN THE TRAILER PAT
[2:31:59] <Devbob98> I had final fantasy 7 spoiled for me for years and I still enjoyed it
[2:32:03] <%Boxortoo> @ClickyButtons yes
[2:32:11] <%AzureGale> It's like people who get all bent out of shape with Pokemon spoilers
[2:32:13] <%BoxNavy> pat is murdering woolie tonight. hes dead.
[2:32:20] <T_Sasquatch> Looool
[2:32:23] <%thelaxinator> I will never be able to forget that he forgot his own favorite game's ending.
[2:32:26] <KeiPrime> you can spoil a pokemon game?
[2:32:27] <Sulliman34> oh i just realized hes the Stonks man
[2:32:29] <RyuuAoi> Doesn't Woolie read comics?
[2:32:30] <Sol_Install> what happen?
[2:32:31] <Tooniearcade> Lol
[2:32:32] <%Boxortoo> The FF7 shit is wild to me because there's a lewd art site literally named after a character dying
[2:32:38] <Meltgar> LUL
[2:32:41] <%Taisuru> Spoilers nearly never matter because it's the context that makes those moments
[2:32:43] <tukds> if you can still pretend to be surprised then you can say you avoided spoilers
[2:32:44] <%walternatorz> Pat's busting woolie's balls because he won't murder children with him.
[2:32:44] <%ssjklyco> Toilet paper
[2:32:46] <$RealThiele> Z-target the mind goblin bag
[2:32:47] <KasiCrafter> Just a LITTLE cbt
[2:32:48] <%darklordfodder> like dishonored mana
[2:32:49] <marvel877> When Woolie gets around to Arkham City, anyone thinking he's gonna play it without the Catwoman DLC?
[2:32:56] <%logoth_> lol
[2:32:57] <%VoidBaronJules> z targeting....
[2:32:57] <%SirGO0SE> 100% accurate
[2:32:58] <%saladin1911> We have heard these over the years, yes LUL LUL
[2:32:58] <%AzureGale> Woolie puts up with Pat better
[2:33:01] <Devbob98> If fortnite causes the death of castle super beast, it’d be fitting
[2:33:03] <%MisterRockett> I don't believe spoilers actually ruins an enjoyment of a thing it just shifts your perspective on first view to something different. It's not inherently a WORSE experience. Like playing Yakuza out of order.
[2:33:06] <Sol_Install> Z targeting
[2:33:08] <%Skelefellah> Own it - double-down on it.
[2:33:09] <%AzureGale> Unless it's TWEWY
[2:33:10] <tukds> Is this "THE" bridge
[2:33:10] <%Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt Remember Woolie shitting on jojo because of LOVE
[2:33:14] <%Taisuru> LUL
[2:33:15] <%Monkeyweed21> what about Kzx
[2:33:16] <%ChestMimik> Thats way funnier than getting defensive
[2:33:19] <%walternatorz> had?
[2:33:21] <+dereksbales> gottem
[2:33:21] <Lancaster_H> youre both different flavours of crazy
[2:33:22] <RyuuAoi> Oh Pat and Woolie used to be ENEMIES at beginning of SBFP
[2:33:22] <%logoth_> z target the bag for max damage
[2:33:23] <%AzureGale> Woolie will NOT put up with TWEWY bashing
[2:33:23] <@commanderclaw> Spoiler culture has gotten out of hand to be honest
[2:33:25] <%Deft_Thought> "Had"
[2:33:25] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:33:26] <ShinChris> we've all got our problems
[2:33:27] <%twistedj3ster> Pat had a "senior  moment"
[2:33:28] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Yeah I've noticed he tries to like comeback at you by deconstructing your crazy
[2:33:29] <ZE_Count> had?
[2:33:30] <+Krecart> at the time
[2:33:30] <%Boxortoo> That whole discussion was hilarious
[2:33:35] <Devbob98> You got better
[2:33:37] <%jaybombdotcom> jaybombdotcom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Hey you're pretty great. keep being cool.
[2:33:38] <Mr_Ease> that said, like if you didn't tell him that the mr freeze boss exists and is incredible there was a possibility he might not play the game because of bad boss fights
[2:33:39] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL Pat used to get so fucking pissed watching Mr. Rogers as a kid
[2:33:41] <MillionStabz> @PatStaresAt Which is weird because co-op LPs on the old channel were the most popular ones
[2:33:43] <xxshadowxx416> @misterrockett 100%
[2:33:51] <hl98> what is neo gaf
[2:33:52] <choopercabra> I dont mind spolers that much since I still want to see how the story leads to it.
[2:33:52] <%Taisuru> We know you too love each other you don't need to prove anything pat.
[2:33:53] <T_Sasquatch> Resetera is digusting
[2:33:54] <Jrocy247> Oh neogaf....
[2:33:57] <%ChestMimik> DONKEY KONG SPOILERS
[2:33:57] <%saladin1911> @misterrockett It depends on the person and the thing.
[2:33:58] <tukds> Woolie has a different type of goblin to deal with, he just chooses to pretend like they don't exist
[2:34:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Oh boy
[2:34:11] <Jrocy247> @hl98 Neogaf is Resetera
[2:34:11] <KeiPrime> dk spoilers?? how
[2:34:12] <Capn_Trips> Rhino?
[2:34:14] <ZE_Count> snape sephiroth killing aerith dumbledore is a classic.
[2:34:14] <Devbob98> People in comments really asking what is neogaf. I feel old
[2:34:15] <SomersaultJustice> rambi is a rhino
[2:34:15] <%weissguard> I still like seeing his content here and there, but frankly, it's one of the things that throws me for a loop with Woolie.
[2:34:20] <marvel877> RHINO
[2:34:21] <Tracazoid> Rambi the Rhino?
[2:34:24] <$RealThiele> rambi? you bitch!
[2:34:24] <%Monkeyweed21> I miss old neo gaf that didnt call people pedophiles and ban them for having opinion
[2:34:28] <crowspeak> Ramby's Back Mother Fuckers!
[2:34:31] <gitdweezzy> Cocaine hella a drug
[2:34:34] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[2:34:35] <%thelaxinator> Those NEOGAF references in Sunset Overdrive must have aged great by now...
[2:34:36] <marvel877> Rhino
[2:34:39] <tukds> Some peiple don't even want to know the name of the gamr
[2:34:39] <%BigCoffee> WHAT WHY
[2:34:40] <+MayorRev> chicken!!
[2:34:41] <%Skelefellah> Woolie doesn't call them goblins, because calling them otherwise keeps the sanity in a safe spot for him about it
[2:34:41] <+RedQueensAce> who?
[2:34:42] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:34:48] <%AzureGale> I remember when someone got mad about people talking about the time skip in Fire Emblem Three Houses, despite it being mentioned in official trailers
[2:34:48] <RyuuAoi> Ram. Rhino. Same difference.
[2:34:50] <%Aldurin_> ruining our decades-long Donkey Kong narrative with these spoilers
[2:34:51] <%hrbeck_> I thought Ramby might have died in DKC3
[2:34:56] <%darklordfodder> hey, the next Mario is going to have jumping
[2:34:58] <%BoxNavy> for me, i dont mind spoilers too much cus half the time i dont know the context so who cares
[2:34:59] <Tracazoid> It's even odder for a non-narrative game like Donkey Kong
[2:35:00] <+dereksbales> "I didnt want to know the game was a game"
[2:35:02] <%Skelefellah> Woolie came to fight it sounds like
[2:35:02] <Broken_Sonex> Woolie is crazy, but not like....a good crazy.
[2:35:06] <ThirdPersonPhil> Lurking
[2:35:06] <KeiPrime> rhinos will ram you so ic ansee the train of thought
[2:35:09] <+traximus_s> isn't that the rhino?
[2:35:14] <%ssjklyco> I think I remember someone got upset saying whether a game is good or bad and considering that as spoilers.
[2:35:15] <%Deft_Thought> I used to get burned up about spoilers before I realized that, absent of context, they don't matter that much.
[2:35:17] <hl98> people with bad opinions should stay off the internet
[2:35:22] <%ChestMimik> Twitter functions WAY different than a Specialized forum
[2:35:22] <%weissguard> If you didn't want the game results?
[2:35:26] <MillionStabz> Speaking of, hope people manage to avoid AOT manga spoilers for A YEAR
[2:35:27] <%Boxortoo> Fucking TIVO
[2:35:30] <JayEarly> I can’t fucking believe the characters from the old game are in the new game how dare you spoil that
[2:35:31] <%Boxortoo> Holy shit I forgot that was a thing
[2:35:35] <%Skelefellah> "I showed up to fight because I want to fight everyone in here"
[2:35:36] <+BIumen> a very 2004 example
[2:35:37] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> VHS, what's that??
[2:35:39] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> Kappa
[2:35:42] <tukds> I don't give a fuck I spoil everything to make sure it's good. If I'm going to comit to a long rpg or show I need to know how it ends beforehand
[2:35:44] <%hrbeck_> Why are you in the strip club and upset there are tiddy?
[2:35:45] <KeiPrime> HOnestly, AOT is not even worth spoiling
[2:35:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember when Woolie thought the basic premise of Obra-Dinn was spoilers
[2:35:46] <%twistedj3ster> For glory and riches?
[2:35:48] <%SWFanatic> paaaaatuh
[2:35:49] <usoto215> i miss sports bars
[2:36:01] <Mattais88> Remmeber when bars existed?
[2:36:02] <TheSphereHunter> you wanna play sports ball?
[2:36:04] <RyuuAoi> I miss dive bars...
[2:36:13] <$alex_streams_a_thing> From what I've seen, pat always own up to his quirks while woolie thinks hes the most sane person making him the true psychopath
[2:36:15] <%Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt I knew a guy who would want to always talk about the new thing be it game or movie and instead of playing or watching he'd just read a summary on wikipedia.
[2:36:15] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt It's more like listening to the radio and having a commercial or the hosts spoil the ending of the BIG GAME that you taped
[2:36:17] <DazzlingFuhrer> spoil mr. freeze to own the libs
[2:36:19] <Mattais88> I haven't had a good chicken wing in years
[2:36:21] <aero160h> why even use social media, it's just toxic garbage
[2:36:23] <%Garthunox> I thought purple orbs in DMCV were spoilers
[2:36:23] <%BigCoffee> As someone who spoils a lot, is there something you personally never want to get spoiled by?
[2:36:24] <%darklordfodder> I want to go to a bar...
[2:36:29] <+polothegreatest> aot final reminds me of other hyped finale
[2:36:31] <%twistedj3ster> NOT A SCRATCH
[2:36:34] <+BigHooppaw> speaking of children
[2:36:35] <%Taisuru> Tried building :V
[2:36:35] <tukds> same
[2:36:36] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Like, you think spoilers should get government subsidies?
[2:36:37] <Lancaster_H> wee child, like the one you just killed
[2:36:38] <hl98> how old is patrick
[2:36:39] <KeiPrime> speaking of children
[2:36:39] <+JustToWatch> as opposed to now when you are a wee adult
[2:36:40] <%ChestMimik> Okay that's a little insane
[2:36:40] <KingKrampus> yo, has anyone pointed out to pat that Lady D is what happens when Paige is twice as tall and 3X times as Thicc?
[2:36:40] <%MisterRockett> Same
[2:36:41] <Devbob98> Pat dies in infinity war
[2:36:42] <$RealThiele> slappy did it
[2:36:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie is Spoiler Fascist while Pat is Spoiler Communist
[2:36:44] <%blistexthief> I did the same damn thing
[2:36:44] <%SWFanatic> paaaaaaatuhhhh
[2:36:45] <+Iggysteve> SAME
[2:36:45] <doctordinkus> you monster
[2:36:46] <Mattais88> I've done that
[2:36:47] <Zebroneath> Pat, you bitch  LUL
[2:36:51] <%SirGO0SE> same
[2:36:52] <%thelaxinator> I never watched game of thrones because I wanted to know the ending first
[2:36:54] <+Matantara> saaaaaaaaame
[2:36:54] <Devbob98> You psycho
[2:36:55] <%jaybombdotcom> No guest this week?
[2:36:57] <%thelaxinator> that worked out great for me
[2:36:58] <Knifefarty> lil detective
[2:37:01] <ThirdPersonPhil> what if it was a mistery?
[2:37:01] <%Daxalog> Some people do that for most books
[2:37:01] <marvel877> They lay an egg at the end.
[2:37:02] <%hrbeck_> studies have shown that's a better way to enjoy media actually
[2:37:02] <Sol_Install> YES
[2:37:03] <%batpick> The Game boy argument.
[2:37:05] <+MayorRev> you're so stupid
[2:37:09] <doctordinkus> twilight zone is the exact same
[2:37:09] <+DynDimAcsiwn> I still do that with most books
[2:37:09] <Sol_Install> That the reason why I got into JOJO
[2:37:10] <%BigCoffee> Yeah but that's not interesting litterature, it's just goosebumps
[2:37:10] <Mr_Ease> yeah I can get the appeal to that
[2:37:11] <%Skelefellah> So the resolution's the primary kicker for ya
[2:37:11] <%legend_of_nolan> ist most last pages past the spoiler?
[2:37:13] <shiibbae> remember chat, this is the same person that seperates milk from cereal
[2:37:13] <%darklordfodder> the only spoilers that annoy me are production spoilers
[2:37:16] <+Shubreaker> i did that with 1984 lok
[2:37:20] <MillionStabz> @PatStaresAt Yoko Taro writes his endings first, because he wants to think of how characters end up there
[2:37:21] <%legend_of_nolan> and I do that too
[2:37:21] <%Fooguwu> I value surprise, so spoilers are bad for me
[2:37:23] <%BigCoffee> I wiki dive most shows and then I enjoy seeing it happen
[2:37:23] <Mattais88> Must really like In media res stories, huh?
[2:37:25] <cis_eraser_420> yeah i've had things' endings spoiled to me and they were still engaging and interesting regardless
[2:37:25] <%twistedj3ster> OHHHH That's why! That's bothered me for YEARS
[2:37:28] <marvel877> The mask attached to a costume, danced a jig, and ran off.
[2:37:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> Also What if its a terrible last page? do you even read the book?
[2:37:29] <%dork_doggler> @batpick woolie was super wrong, OG game boy had fuck-all for games
[2:37:32] <%Jaxnos> wait, is that why you wildly theorize now?
[2:37:44] <%Treuan> I want to be where the people are
[2:37:44] <$RealThiele> YOU TELL HIM BLANCHE FUCK YEAH
[2:37:45] <+dereksbales> so if you could play the last mission of games first would you?
[2:37:45] <%DedlokPM> I remember trying to dodge Spider-Man Homecome trailer talk because I hadn't seen EndGame yet. Saw a tweet from someone talking about it and said it was spoiler-free impressions of the trailer. Read the tweet and it told me the spoiler from the trailer without actually saying the trailer because they said "I like how REDACTED is the new Uncle Ben for MCU Spider-Man"
[2:37:51] <%Jaxnos> aaah got it
[2:37:53] <RyuuAoi> Well they tell you to do that, Pat. You read the last page of books to see if it jumps out at you. That's how you know if the book is worthy to you.
[2:37:54] <fritz_dacat> What one of fav goosebumps books
[2:37:55] <ammobasket> Evolved into wanting to know what people think about the ending first
[2:37:55] <$Garthunox> even if its schlock like a David Cage game?
[2:37:57] <%Skelefellah> @MillionStabz Somehow that makes way too much sense, not even considering how crazy the guy is
[2:37:58] <Devbob98> Wandavision fucked me up on waiting
[2:38:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt didn't woolie think the basic premise of Obra-Dinn was spoilers
[2:38:03] <hl98> is he playing as stonks guy?
[2:38:07] <%VoidBaronJules> i still do that with books occasionally. as for films I'm the same and our mas hates watching films with us for that reason
[2:38:09] <KeiPrime> gameboy had some good games but most were based on a bigger game
[2:38:10] <Zebroneath> You ever try those choose-your-own adventure books?
[2:38:15] <%saladin1911> Nah, I couldn't do that. I rarely watch movies and TV but when I do, I mostly need it to turn my brain off
[2:38:15] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:38:17] <%DedlokPM> @hl98 ye
[2:38:25] <%extradopeness> yo
[2:38:29] <%Skelefellah> You just described th emechanic
[2:38:30] <KeiPrime> like The megaman games on gameboy are good and they're different from the nes ones but they're kinda the same gameplay wise
[2:38:31] <+dave323dave> marketing = spoliers lol
[2:38:32] <%Skelefellah> And that wa sit
[2:38:34] <tukds> "It's good"
[2:38:40] <$RealThiele> insurance sim
[2:38:41] <+traximus_s> someone's there
[2:38:43] <%MelBrooksKA> To be fair the basic premise of Outer Wilds is spoilers
[2:38:43] <%BigCoffee> I love episodes and shows that start near the end, and the entire show/movie is "how did we end up there"
[2:38:44] <%ChestMimik> Is the basic premise of Outer Wilds a spoiler?
[2:38:47] <hl98> just don't interact with the fans
[2:38:52] <%hrbeck_> How DARE you discuss video game mechanics on this video game podcast between us, video game people!
[2:38:54] <RyuuAoi> I don't watch trailers.
[2:38:55] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Get off the friggen internet, ya goof!
[2:38:56] <Devbob98> Don’t go online
[2:38:58] <%Skelefellah> Ooooh fancy builder
[2:39:03] <%Skelefellah> But hows the shootin'
[2:39:06] <DianaTheAscian> long story short Woolie smells
[2:39:07] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Stop all the downloadin'!
[2:39:07] <DazzlingFuhrer> EXPLODED INTO TOWERS
[2:39:09] <SpaceManHotepIV> ooh dat boy sweatin
[2:39:09] <KeiPrime> STEAL HIS CAR
[2:39:12] <julrave> On the other hand the Switch trailer for Outer Wilds was really bad at spoiling shit
[2:39:13] <%Aldurin_> lol that backdown when he took the shotgun to the face
[2:39:17] <%Taisuru> A BUILDOMAN
[2:39:20] <%ChestMimik> Spoilers
[2:39:20] <%AncelDeLambert> well shit
[2:39:25] <tukds> lost to the tryhard
[2:39:25] <%ChestMimik> Pat died
[2:39:26] <%AzureGale> ONE SHOT WAS ALL THEY NEEDED
[2:39:26] <%Boxortoo> I mean atleast trailers that spoil a full movie save you the trouble of watching garbage
[2:39:28] <%SWFanatic> stonks
[2:39:30] <%blistexthief> Top 10 tho
[2:39:31] <+traximus_s> DAMN
[2:39:33] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I like this skin tho
[2:39:35] <Mr_Ease> Also like, its really becoming obnoxious because spoiler culture is absolutely exploited to keep discussion of media down
[2:39:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> Peaker's Advantage
[2:39:44] <MuffinMastr> that pump shotgun is too strong -_-
[2:39:46] <@SoFarFetched> the steam page for Outer Wilds says the premise for it.
[2:39:49] <Devbob98> All that building was pretty worthless lol
[2:39:50] <leinadtonu> killed by children
[2:39:59] <%Skelefellah> Things can change from the earlier visualization of the game which often happens before release
[2:40:03] <reddpop_> would you say that the new cap's character arc is a spoiler? I feel like it's the most obvious thing as soon as that dude speaks
[2:40:07] <danpc5> @PatStaresAt I think Suzie was asking if you wanted to play with her
[2:40:07] <thatsocrunchy> You just got Hemmingway’d
[2:40:07] <%Boxortoo> @PatStaresAt My favorite was every new KH3 trailer just SPOILED THE FUCK OUT OF MAJOR EVENTS
[2:40:12] <+polothegreatest> anime dgaf about spoilers
[2:40:14] <%Boxortoo> That shit was the BEST
[2:40:15] <Explodincatz> OW is so good
[2:40:24] <%AncelDeLambert> well get her in here
[2:40:26] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[2:40:27] <TheSphereHunter> thesph1MistyScared thesph1MistyScared thesph1MistyScared
[2:40:28] <%Taisuru> More like fartnight
[2:40:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Anime ops having spoilers in them is STILL happening
[2:40:31] <%doomunderthestairs> @PatStaresAt would you consider a hotdog a sandwich?
[2:40:31] <%valriot> D Cord?
[2:40:32] <%AzureGale> Dee Cord
[2:40:32] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt there's two spoilers i always avoid, the culprit in P4 and DIO's stand
[2:40:33] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> game doesn't sound nearly as interesting with out spoiling it
[2:40:34] <%saladin1911> "Spoiler culture" sounds like a completely bullshit term. People super don't like spoilers, others don't mind them. People are different folks
[2:40:35] <%MelBrooksKA> I recall you not being able to talk about anything when playing OW
[2:40:37] <%blistexthief> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:40:38] <%bustawof> fuck yeah tomatoPog

[2:41:11] <xxshadowxx416> @boxortoo kh3 was only like 2hours os good game
[2:41:11] <%extradopeness> suzi i loved your REmake stream earlier this week
[2:41:12] <tukds> Pat did you spoil Attack on Titan and Evangelion for yourself yet?
[2:41:13] <mike2hands> Did you see the bayo cosplay suzi did? Is awesome????
[2:41:14] <MrChaosDoughnut> Yaay, kitty!
[2:41:15] <mike2hands> !!!!
[2:41:19] <JayEarly> The central fucking mechanic never counts as a spoiler and you’re wrong if you disagree
[2:41:21] <Devbob98> A little bit
[2:41:23] <%valriot> OH MAN LUL
[2:41:23] <%BoxNavy> DUDE
[2:41:25] <%walternatorz> oh god, the fucking trailers
[2:41:28] <%SirGO0SE> i wonder if dog think cat is dog
[2:41:29] <marvel877> How about when Smash Bros introduces characters by also making spoiler references in their reveal trailer or even their Final Smashes?
[2:41:30] <%Boxortoo> @xxshadowxx416 As a KH fan 3 was just like 90% garbage lol
[2:41:32] <%BoxNavy> I GOT SPOILED ON SO MUCH OF SHB
[2:41:33] <%Skelefellah> HOO BOY
[2:41:41] <%ChestMimik> @tukds He was talking about AoT on Twitter
[2:41:41] <%Garthunox> YEAH HOLY FUCK THE TRAILERS
[2:41:44] <hl98> amazing LUL
[2:41:46] <%bustawof> those trailers got BEEEG SPOILERS
[2:41:48] <MuffinMastr> Pat, what's your juiciest spoiler?
[2:41:50] <+BIumen> ShB?
[2:41:51] <%shad8snake> lmao
[2:41:52] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[2:41:52] <%ChestMimik> @tukds Using an ROT13 cipher
[2:41:54] <T_Sasquatch> Tbh i never noticed
[2:41:55] <%Boxortoo> Yeah I learned in Stormblood to just never watch any new trailer
[2:41:56] <%weissguard> That's a big way to spoil for those trailers.
[2:41:58] <%Taisuru> Taisuru subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! Are you ever worried about Suzi comin after your orb? She is a self proclaimed Sphere Hunter after all.
[2:41:58] <Wildpandaman> On the topic of spoilers for this  a fun one is you do not play it anymore, but genshin impact patch notes and trailers has SUPER MEGA Spoilers to things
[2:41:59] <+GDM117> spider man 3 was spoiled for me I was so mad Harry died but then the movie was garbage.
[2:41:59] <KeiPrime> but theres no context
[2:42:00] <tukds> They hope you forget by the time you get there
[2:42:02] <%Skelefellah> The whole 'primals' thing for ShB was a stretch by a margin, too
[2:42:02] <+MackFighters> someone got paid to edit that trailer
[2:42:02] <Tracazoid> I do like that the Warframe community seems go out of their way not to spoiler THAT thing though. Though yeah FFXIV doesn't give a shit.
[2:42:02] <KeiPrime> so it doesnt matter
[2:42:04] <%walternatorz> ...
[2:42:04] <%Aldurin_> I can't wait for the next expansion's first trailer to be a VaatiVidya lore breakdown of the expansion
[2:42:04] <%za7az> @xxshadowxx416 So much wasted potential :(
[2:42:06] <%BoxNavy> damn
[2:42:08] <SpaceManHotepIV> gottem
[2:42:09] <%Agami23> wait. they didnt show the best boy scene in the trailer for heavensward, did they?
[2:42:11] <%Boxortoo> Becasue I was still in fucking Heavenward
[2:42:11] <MuffinMastr> LUL
[2:42:11] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> How did you get Emlo and Gief used to each other, @PatStaresAt ? Is it difficult?
[2:42:12] <%ChestMimik> Pat's Jucy Nuts will grind the children
[2:42:13] <%blistexthief> Man, Horizon was such a great game
[2:42:13] <dragoon001914> I love being spoiled, it just makes me excited to see how we get to the moment.
[2:42:13] <+JobbedBone> D: Karen Zero Dawn is in this? D:
[2:42:14] <Explodincatz> thats Jpana allright
[2:42:14] <%Deft_Thought> Talk about POGGERS am I right
[2:42:16] <%darklordfodder> coconuts have liquid
[2:42:17] <$RealThiele> spoiled nutt
[2:42:17] <+sillyschlub> mmmm
[2:42:17] <+BusterRepukken> you weren't sorry at all
[2:42:19] <T_Sasquatch> I watched all those trailers and never felt spoiled
[2:42:19] <RyuuAoi> Haha
[2:42:22] <%za7az> GOT'EM
[2:42:23] <Jrocy247> That was actually funny for once pat
[2:42:24] <ZE_Count> Hey Pat you ever beat Horizon Zero Dawn?
[2:42:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> Was that the Flash, couldnt he run any faster?
[2:42:25] <$spleekle> fort NUT
[2:42:26] <hl98> do spoilers really matter in an mmo?
[2:42:26] <reddpop_> Is it a spoiler if you have no context? Nier Automata has the last lines of the game in it's debut trailer but you can't know they're significant
[2:42:31] <Mattais88> Biggest Spoiler: Jesus Dies
[2:42:33] <Mr_Ease> I can't believe you all spoiled that Tomato town got wiped out
[2:42:33] <marvel877> Your nuts are aerodynamic like a car spoilers?
[2:42:35] <xxshadowxx416> @boxortoo that right
[2:42:35] <thatlolifrompersona1> That guy suffered
[2:42:38] <%za7az> psaDab
[2:42:45] <%batpick> That's not juicy that's salty.
[2:42:47] <%Skelefellah> There's a difference between being an asshole about spoiling and not, y'know
[2:42:48] <%Garthunox> @hl98 It has a story dude
[2:42:49] <Devbob98> @mattais88  But he got better
[2:42:50] <$RealThiele> be kind to one another spoilers gonna happen
[2:42:50] <%Boxortoo> @hl98 FFXIV is the only mmo I know of that has a story that matters so in that context it does.
[2:42:53] <%Garthunox> Yes ofc
[2:42:55] <+BIumen> What was the spoiler in the ShB trailer? I mean it's got stuff obviously but what did Pat mean?
[2:42:59] <Explodincatz> @hl98 imo no, mmo's are built to never end
[2:43:00] <%Monkeyweed21> or a bad ending to a manga recently
[2:43:20] <%Garthunox> @hl98 That's a ludicrous statement
[2:43:20] <+JobbedBone> but WHY doesn't japan care about spoilers? is it the same reason why anime plots tend not to have central themes
[2:43:24] <%valriot> Bioshock is kinda trash honestly
[2:43:24] <@SoFarFetched> Pat only said ShB and HW trailer showed post credits stuff
[2:43:25] <Devbob98> Ten years is fair game tbh
[2:43:41] <%Taisuru> @BIumen Pretty sure someone answering that is banable in this chat :V
[2:43:41] <KeiPrime> how would you know
[2:43:42] <$RealThiele> Randian utopia with no public services and murder hobo gangs
[2:43:42] <T_Sasquatch> Getting mad about decade old games is silly
[2:43:42] <Ralfclogs> Maybe Woolie is defensive about spoilers because so many woolie vs let's plays are blind
[2:43:44] <%JoshManVGH> Does Woolie do it for the content though?
[2:43:45] <@SoFarFetched> He's not  gonna go into specifics in case people in chat haven't gotten to HW or ShB
[2:43:45] <%Deft_Thought> Absent of context the spoiler is meaningless
[2:43:50] <%Agami23> i really need to play bioshock
[2:43:50] <JayEarly> @reddpop_ the original Nier has parts of the last ending in its intro but it spoils mothing
[2:43:50] <marvel877> But remember, NEVER WATCH A LAUNCH TRAILER FOR AN RPG! Looking at you FFVII Remake.
[2:43:53] <%Agami23> i just suck at it
[2:43:53] <%darklordfodder> Vader is Luke's father
[2:43:54] <%ssjklyco> The Cake is a Lie
[2:43:54] <%SirGO0SE> spoilers: peach is in another castle
[2:43:57] <%BoxNavy> you have to just shrug it off at that point
[2:43:59] <%ramielthe5th> whrere's suzi?
[2:44:09] <%Skelefellah> There's a level of how you say it that can be spoiler-esque, but not actually covering the spoiler completely.
[2:44:15] <RyuuAoi> OH FUCK. WOOLIE SPOILED "HEAT" FOR ME. IM PISSED.
[2:44:17] <+dereksbales> how do you feel about the cop raids on businesses in Canada right now
[2:44:20] <%weissguard> That's gonna be a couple decades in about 2 years, holy shit
[2:44:23] <Ralfclogs> Cool
[2:44:28] <suckasurprise> dspPepe
[2:44:31] <Devbob98> It’s Woolie, that’s how he be
[2:44:32] <dragoon001914> God Heat is a fantastic movie
[2:44:35] <Mattais88> I remember walking out of LotR 1 and people getting mad at me for spoiling Gandalf didn't die.
[2:44:38] <cis_eraser_420> @RyuuAoi oh man. f
[2:44:42] <+eanscrale> Like if a spoiler really ruins the whole story, the story probably isn't that good.
[2:44:43] <Tracazoid> It's funny because all I know about Jojo past part 2 is from you and Woolie
[2:44:48] <+JobbedBone> is it still a spoiler if you think the work is stupid though
[2:44:48] <%darklordfodder> Speed has a bomb on a bus that will go off it it drops below 55 mph.
[2:44:49] <BerryliciousDefinition> Some people just dont want to be spoiled
[2:44:50] <%MelBrooksKA> From the sounds of it it sounds like he was way more anal about spoilers back in the day
[2:44:58] <%Garthunox> @Mattais88 out of theatres?
[2:45:00] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> ?
[2:45:00] <hl98> bully woolie more
[2:45:00] <+Gespens> Like, 2006 or 2007?
[2:45:01] <%shad8snake> 13?
[2:45:02] <%ExpressNode> Came out in 2008
[2:45:03] <DrkJP520> If I had a stand, it would be to blur/bleep any spoiler I wouldn't want to see/hear.
[2:45:03] <ItIsSky> 12?
[2:45:03] <Broken_Sonex> More than 10 at least
[2:45:04] <+fuchard1996> ~13
[2:45:05] <%Monkeyweed21> 2006
[2:45:06] <ZE_Count> ps2
[2:45:07] <%ChestMimik> Came out in 2008
[2:45:07] <MrChaosDoughnut> It's a PS*2* game.
[2:45:08] <%baka_sugoi> old
[2:45:10] <+swid_harry> i think 2008
[2:45:10] <BigHugs> P4 is like 2008
[2:45:11] <%doomunderthestairs> damn
[2:45:11] <suckasurprise> This conversation is making me feel mega old dspPepe
[2:45:11] <%blistexthief> Older than some of the people in chat
[2:45:11] <%AzureGale> psaBig old
[2:45:11] <%Emperor_Machinus> Someone spoiled me about the Heat death of the universe. I am angry. I didn't want how it ended, only got to humans so far
[2:45:13] <%za7az> 69
[2:45:13] <Devbob98> Really god damn
[2:45:15] <JayEarly> @ryuuaoi Heat is unspoilable, it’s just as good the 100th time you watch it
[2:45:15] <%BigCoffee> there are levels of spoilers too, some singular spoilers can ruin an entire plot, while others are important details
[2:45:18] <xxshadowxx416> p4g is like 8 year old
[2:45:18] <AsterisTV> P4 is 2008
[2:45:21] <%BoxNavy> is there a "reset the clock" moment when a game gets re-released or a large scale remake?
[2:45:24] <Tracazoid> The culprit
[2:45:26] <%doomunderthestairs> I just got P3P too thinking that was only 10 years back
[2:45:28] <DianaTheAscian> imo time shouldn't count as a pass to spoil something
[2:45:31] <%ExpressNode> 2006 was P3
[2:45:33] <$RealThiele> 13 years old uff
[2:45:34] <Mattais88> @Garthunox Yeah.
[2:45:36] <cis_eraser_420> though tbh the entire value of Heat is actually watching the movie and soaking it in. the movie's pretty obvious about how it's all gonna end up
[2:45:37] <%ChestMimik> Atlus VERY MUCH does NOT
[2:45:37] <+fuchard1996> still can't believe Nanako was the killer
[2:45:38] <RyuuAoi> Pat DONT SPOIL P4 I'm on P2 Eternal Punishment! PLEASE
[2:45:42] <+polothegreatest> YOU HAVE 20 MINUTES UNTIL THE SOLAR SYSTEM...
[2:45:42] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> 0000000000000000
[2:45:47] <%AzureGale> they did?
[2:45:49] <%Deft_Thought> CULPRIT is everywhere, man
[2:45:50] <tukds> dancing
[2:45:52] <+kewlmyc> Lol here is culprit dancin
[2:45:52] <%shad8snake> P4 Arena Ultimax shit was wild
[2:45:52] <+Gespens> BBTAG
[2:45:53] <%Garthunox> @Mattais88 Cant blame em then, thats a dick thing to do
[2:45:55] <+Itselguapo> dancing all night he's playable
[2:45:56] <+fuchard1996> dancing
[2:45:57] <CaptainBright> 14+ years, in JP release
[2:45:58] <Tracazoid> Remember that time Hitler showed up in Persona 2, good times
[2:45:58] <dragoon001914> And Golden has a social link with them too
[2:46:02] <+swid_harry> I cant play P4 Ultimax with my friend because it would spoil him lol
[2:46:03] <Sol_Install> oh yea
[2:46:03] <Devbob98> Murder mysteries should be left out of spoilers
[2:46:04] <+JobbedBone> ZELDA IS MY WHAT?!
[2:46:09] <%Lion_kun> The culprit is super predictable lol
[2:46:11] <%darklordfodder> it's 2008, but at the same time the PC release is recent.
[2:46:11] <%BoxNavy> john culprit that motherfucker
[2:46:16] <tukds> Japanese don't give a fuck about spoilers
[2:46:17] <JayEarly> @dianatheascian no fuck that once something is years old its fair game for people to talk about like fucking human beings
[2:46:19] <Sol_Install> the reveal is a good moment
[2:46:21] <%Skelefellah> There's a CULPRIT? Spoiler.
[2:46:26] <marvel877> DAMN YOU SPOILER OWL
[2:46:26] <+eanscrale> arcsys went hard
[2:46:27] <blue8moon> well as someone who doesn't know that's very nice
[2:46:29] <Mattais88> @Garthunox The book was 80 years old
[2:46:32] <hl98> its junko
[2:46:35] <+MisterRockett> The entire FGC knows who the culprit is and they hate turn based JRPGs they're the community LEAST likely to have played the original game before it had come out.
[2:46:36] <MuffinMastr> Spoiler, everyone DIES
[2:46:43] <%Garthunox> @Mattais88 How old was the movie?
[2:46:44] <%AzureGale> Yeah that makes sense
[2:46:46] <+JobbedBone> his mom is dead he dresses up as her and kills people
[2:46:49] <%Agami23> man, the scene where you have to say who culprit is is the best
[2:46:53] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt At this point it's less about knowing who it is but finding HOW they find out who it is.
[2:46:56] <DianaTheAscian> @JayEarly yeah no
[2:47:00] <%ChestMimik> Why does The Bible spoil Passion of the Christ?
[2:47:01] <+kewlmyc> It just released on the PC
[2:47:06] <%Skelefellah> If they cared enough about it, they had more than ample time to consume that media.
[2:47:06] <+DrTribal> emulated as well
[2:47:06] <%Garthunox> @Mattais88 Did you walk out of a book reading or a movie?
[2:47:07] <%Monkeyweed21> what about children?
[2:47:08] <%dave323dave> would someone get upset at the mere mention of the culprit?
[2:47:08] <xxshadowxx416> rip ps vita
[2:47:10] <$RealThiele> the what-a?
[2:47:11] <mrlastchance1> yeah but no one played those games
[2:47:13] <marvel877> His wife is his arm, this game is fucking dumb.
[2:47:14] <%ExpressNode> I still have my Vita copy
[2:47:16] <%AzureGale> These two guys are the same person
[2:47:17] <%shad8snake> well the game did just come out on steam now, plenty of people that probably never touch it
[2:47:18] <reddpop_> I had p4 spoiled before I even knew what P4 was. killed any desire to play it
[2:47:18] <Meltgar> VITA? WHAT'S THAT? Kappa
[2:47:22] <%saladin1911> But tbf, a ton of people only got introduced to the Persona series with P5. AND these games are SUPER long.
[2:47:22] <%dork_doggler> Rosebud was Citizen Kane's sled, btw
[2:47:23] <T_Sasquatch> And its been emulateable for years LUL
[2:47:29] <KeiPrime> vita means life
[2:47:32] <RyuuAoi> I'm trying, Pat! I'm stuck on Sugawara in P2!!
[2:47:32] <+JobbedBone> Anything older than fight club is okay to spoil
[2:47:33] <%bmoral64> I got spoiled on a One Piece moment and it still hit just as hard as it would've otherwise. It definitely depends on the specific moment
[2:47:33] <Octocon> p4 wasnt on ps3 lol only the fighter
[2:47:36] <DrkJP520> In Europe, Persona 4 was only on PS2 and Vita for the longest time. Never got the game digitally on PS3
[2:47:37] <JayEarly> I knew who the villain was in Persona 4 before I played it and it didn’t ruin shit
[2:47:39] <thatsocrunchy> Vita I knew her so
[2:47:39] <%AzureGale> That lady is actually a man
[2:47:40] <+DrTribal> @dork_doggler DUEDDEDE OMG
[2:47:42] <%darklordfodder> Vita? I hardly know her.
[2:47:44] <%Garthunox> NieR is a good upcoming example
[2:47:48] <%ssjklyco> I still don't know who Culprit. And I think I even heard your P4 spoiler cast with woolie
[2:47:51] <%ExpressNode> Changed the battery in my Vita to for the long haul
[2:47:56] <Qsmash_> I know so much about p4 bc p4 fans wouldn't shut the fuck up about it
[2:47:58] <hl98> spoiling stuff is funny tho
[2:48:00] <+kewlmyc> Jojo Part 6 is a good example
[2:48:01] <%Garthunox> @Mattais88 :)

[2:49:13] <+eanscrale> wait why, what happens?
[2:49:14] <+gespenst25> Romeo and Juliet says how it's going to end on the first page
[2:49:15] <Mattais88> @Garthunox I see you're point but LotR is THE fantasy book.
[2:49:15] <%ChestMimik> PAGE ONE IS SAYING THEY'RE FUCKED
[2:49:15] <Tracazoid> God Pat, how could you I was just reading through that play LUL
[2:49:17] <ammobasket> Although, going into a performance of Tempest benefits from you reading it first
[2:49:18] <coreroma> Spoilers, Romeo & Juliet kiss
[2:49:19] <JayEarly> @tracazoid yeah and I’m sure people will take no responsibility to avoid spoilers and whine anyway
[2:49:20] <blue8moon> romeo and juliet tells you at the beginning of the story in the first place

[2:49:43] <%Agami23> if someone tells you jesus dies in the end, wooh boy.
[2:49:44] <%Aldurin_> spoilers for ancient literature is weird because anything you might care about you probably read in high school
[2:49:49] <vile_brand> baldur
[2:49:52] <motn_plays> Take longer than not at all to think if the person may enjoy the surprise  before you go into any details.

[2:49:56] <%weissguard> Oh yeah, that was kinda wild
[2:49:56] <+fuchard1996> How long did it take you guys to finish Romeo must die mode?
[2:49:56] <hl98> not everyone is as cultured as you patrick
[2:49:59] <tukds> It was pretty obvious
[2:50:00] <+eanscrale> goes to show storytelling is not dependant on surprise
[2:50:00] <%Garthunox> THAT WAS HILARIOUS!

[2:51:32] <%Jaxnos> there's quite an obvious thing that can be spoiled about God of War though because it is a thing they remixed.
[2:51:33] <RyuuAoi> Then that mean....Luke and Ren related!
[2:51:33] <%ssjklyco> The 2nd is Luke made out with his Sister. Twice
[2:51:33] <%Deft_Thought> How could you spoil that Christ nailed to a cross bro wtf
[2:51:34] <%Taisuru> All that building for 10 damage
[2:51:37] <+Shillk> why do they always jump off their ramp, it never seems to work?
[2:51:39] <+glgzephyr> that guy did 10 whole damage to you!
[2:51:40] <%JoshManVGH> Spoilers for Noah ahead...
[2:51:44] <Sol_Install> I agree
[2:51:47] <Kratok> nuh
[2:51:47] <%Deft_Thought> I haven't gotten to that part of the Bible I'm still on the Old Testament
[2:51:49] <+NickHatesSnow> i knew the first 6 films before watching them
[2:51:49] <%BoxNavy> me :)
[2:51:49] <%strakillias> Homer spoiling empire coming out of the theater may be my favorite Simpsons joke.
[2:51:50] <El_GhostV1> I haven’t watched a single star war and I know that
[2:51:53] <dragoon001914> It's crazy because Vader being Luke's father is such a huge fucking reveal for the story but because it was so huge that it's so well known now.
[2:51:57] <Agami23> you know whats weird? spoilers for D&D
[2:51:59] <%Taisuru> Never
[2:51:59] <%weissguard> It's all a balancing act
[2:52:00] <%Garthunox> i love this conversation
[2:52:00] <Sol_Install> Some people need to like chill a bit about being pissy and being an asshole about spoilers
[2:52:01] <%BoxNavy> :) ok
[2:52:02] <marvel877> And God Of War was made for the US, a country that focuses on teaching Greek and only Greek myth in school, so Norse myth was not known to that audience very well.
[2:52:05] <%ExpressNode> I never been pissy but I do understand people wanting a fresh experience
[2:52:05] <%bmoral64> Aerith is also the first thing I learned about FF7, in fact I thought it happened much earlier in the game before ever playing it since it was so well known
[2:52:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Dont spoil what happened to Aerith god
[2:52:08] <+glgzephyr> nah, be respectful of us spoiler babies
[2:52:10] <%thesaltiestscrublord> thesaltiestscrublord is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 10 in the channel! 
[2:52:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ermegerd I can't belive Pifa dies at the end of Fantasy Hero 24

[2:52:11] <%thesaltiestscrublord> thesaltiestscrublord gifted a Tier 1 sub to GeneralMetaG! 
[2:52:12] <%Skelefellah> It ranges from astonishing to unreasonable, but there is a level of approach you should consider
[2:52:16] <BerryliciousDefinition> Be excellent t each other
[2:52:18] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> But Pat, what if I hate people?
[2:52:18] <RyuuAoi> Common curtesy
[2:52:22] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> I forgot the last time I wasnt spoiled on any story before i got to the "thing"
[2:52:27] <T_Sasquatch> But i do !
[2:52:33] <T_Sasquatch> I do want that !
[2:52:36] <+StickonATree> yea no one spoil the ending of marvel vs capcom infinate for me
[2:52:36] <Jrocy247> Sephiroth is Cloud's Father
[2:52:37] <+dereksbales> apocalypse now is old and popular but I don't know it, so is it my fault for spoilers?
[2:52:39] <Sol_Install> GOD
[2:52:39] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:52:40] <%Aldurin_> fair
[2:52:41] <TheSphereHunter> I DM
[2:52:43] <%Xevtes> say waaat
[2:52:43] <tukds> The Woolie asshole blowout our
[2:52:43] <Sol_Install> so many are shite
[2:52:43] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the rules on spoilers change from franchise to franchise tbh
[2:52:46] <+BusterRepukken> dont spoil Cod's story
[2:52:47] <%walternatorz> fortnite's story is impeccable
[2:52:48] <+terry_quest> BUT THE LORE
[2:52:49] <%shad8snake> they are
[2:52:49] <%Deft_Thought> It's still an experience
[2:52:50] <Wak033> are ya winning son?
[2:52:50] <DracaenaLeaf> i love genshin and its story telling is ass
[2:52:50] <%BigCoffee> What about the spoilers to say, SH2 ?
[2:52:52] <Mattais88> And most of the ones that aren't you can see comingf rom a mile away
[2:52:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Aerith gives birth to Red XIII
[2:52:54] <reddpop_> yeah but fuck anyone who spoils nier
[2:52:55] <$RealThiele> Suzi activate
[2:52:55] <Sol_Install> and it hurts me cause they could be good or even great
[2:52:56] <BerryliciousDefinition> ehhhh
[2:52:59] <+GDM117> Thanks for the Jesus spoilers guys! I just started the manga :[
[2:52:59] <%hrbeck_> @dereksbales yes
[2:53:01] <coreroma> You can't avoid spoilers. Even my car has spoilers!
[2:53:01] <%MelBrooksKA> Don't be my cousin at Thanksgiving going "that epidsode from the Mandolorian was like a week ago, how can it be spoilers"
[2:53:02] <%ChestMimik> I had a friend get mad that I spoiled Miles Morales was Spider-Man, when I didn't even get far enough to know he was IN the PS4 game
[2:53:04] <%Emperor_Machinus> @BusterRepukken Guy shoots gun
[2:53:05] <%Taisuru> Suziiiiiiii
[2:53:08] <dragoon001914> Morrowind's STORY is amazing but the presentation of it is fucking terrible because it's an open world game.
[2:53:11] <+DynDimAcsiwn> gameplay stuff can be spoilers too, like cool mechanics or enemies
[2:53:12] <%intestinal_bleeding> Wait what
[2:53:18] <%Fooguwu> Pyramid Head is your father D:
[2:53:21] <+JobbedBone> I've learned to stop caring about giving people the exact same experience I got with the game, when I share things I like with people
[2:53:25] <RyuuAoi> Just watch Pat's LP....
[2:53:27] <%Aldurin_> Your podcast and video series have thoroughly spoiled the Resident Evil series for me, and I can't even be mad considering the writing in that franchise
[2:53:29] <Ravioli_Ronin> Does pat have a matchmaking code or did he coward out?
[2:53:32] <Lancaster_H> silent hill's execution of the story is way better than it's finale
[2:53:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I forget that part of the LP, does SH2 even have spoilers
[2:53:35] <+MackFighters> the hill wasn't actually silent
[2:53:37] <tukds> Say the gamer word pat
[2:53:41] <%Agami23> i should watch jacobs latter
[2:53:51] <KeiPrime> i cant believe silent hill fucked that horse
[2:53:55] <T_Sasquatch> I remember watching Jacobs ladder blind. Still don't know wtf i watched
[2:54:02] <MuffinMastr> Jacobs ladder, i didnt know whos ladder that was, spoilers.
[2:54:04] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Spoiler: Tim Robbins doesn't actually wear glasses
[2:54:05] <%Lion_kun> Usual Suspects
[2:54:06] <namisrot> i actually know literally nothing about jacobs ladder
[2:54:06] <+BusterRepukken> silent hill salted my crops
[2:54:08] <marvel877> Remember the spoilers for Spec Ops: The Line?
[2:54:09] <%Fooguwu> I cant believe it was actually a loud hill the whole time
[2:54:11] <%Deft_Thought> Most spoilers, absent of context, aren't going to impact your experience with a piece of material
[2:54:17] <%ChestMimik> Don't enjoy product, only consume product
[2:54:19] <tukds> people like to pretend to be shocked
[2:54:23] <dragoon001914> I love Spec Ops: The Line
[2:54:24] <Tracazoid> Did you know the plague doctor lady in RE5 is Jill? *He says as if RE's story matters*
[2:54:26] <Ravioli_Ronin> Maybe the real ladder was the Jacob’s we met along the way
[2:54:30] <%BigCoffee> doesnt breaking bad start at the end?
[2:54:31] <reddpop_> I heard the spoiler to the last star wars and it saved me hours of my life
[2:54:33] <DianaTheAscian> its really good
[2:54:33] <%BoxNavy> breaking bads ending is the least interesting thing about that show
[2:54:34] <%Lion_kun> I knew the twist in the Usual Suspects and still enjoyed the film
[2:54:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Oh yeah the very verrry end of Breaking Bad
[2:54:39] <%LeiaSkynoober> There was a study done where spoilers can actually enhance most people's experiences
[2:54:45] <hl98> breaking bad is ResidentSleeper
[2:54:46] <comicalmond9135> the best show of all time
[2:54:51] <+MisterRockett> There's nothing you could have spoiled for me in BB that would have ruined it for me. I probably would have enjoyed it MORE knowing the ending.
[2:54:56] <%JoshManVGH> There's also something to be said about fomulaic stories or genres. Spoil a Romantic Comedy... I dare you.
[2:54:58] <+BusterRepukken> My first experience with Breaking Bad was the finale episode and it got me into the series.
[2:54:59] <%BigCoffee> breaking bad is one of the rare shows where the ride > the ending
[2:55:01] <Ravioli_Ronin> I’ve spoiled so much shit for myself
[2:55:04] <coreroma> Breaking Bad is BASED on a true story
[2:55:05] <+traximus_s> I'm playing through FF7 for the first time.I know a bit but I'm still being surprised
[2:55:10] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt breaking bad is really predictable but every seen is great
[2:55:12] <+JobbedBone> but it feels good to go D:
[2:55:26] <%BoxNavy> cranston is amazing
[2:55:26] <%UvBenServed> I got spoiled on the end of Breaking Bad season 4 by a fucking trailer for season 5
[2:55:29] <%Treuan> Cranston is a treasure
[2:55:35] <Lancaster_H> i was spoiled on the BB ending before I started and I still loved it
[2:55:36] <%BoxNavy> now i gotta rewatch that show. again.
[2:55:37] <%ChestMimik> Aren't the original Greek plays built on the audience knowing the end?
[2:55:38] <%SABiscotti> Crack Ping
[2:55:40] <ZE_Count> Who knew the Malcolm in the middle dad had it in him
[2:55:40] <reddpop_> Breaking Bad ruined all other tv. bar was set too high for me
[2:55:43] <RyuuAoi> Meth is a hell of a drug...
[2:55:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ahhh, good ol' Virginia meth labs. Smells like home.
[2:55:50] <%foxrock8> He can't keep getting away with it!
[2:55:54] <%Dakuu75> question: aren't you able to craft death-traps in fortnight-O?
[2:55:58] <%ssjklyco> A different man from Malcoms dad
[2:56:01] <coreroma> Lets all have a nerdgasm for cranston420
[2:56:03] <DrkJP520> I somehow watched Breaking Bad 2-3 years ago without being spoiled. 'Twas awesome
[2:56:08] <Sol_Install> YEP
[2:56:10] <%Agami23> the spoiler of whats under kratos's floor in god of war is less important than the action of him getting it
[2:56:13] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt did you spoil yourself on the killer of disco wisco?
[2:56:13] <%shad8snake> tragic or happy
[2:56:13] <T_Sasquatch> Everyone dieeessss
[2:56:14] <+MisterRockett> They would sometimes just tell the audience what the ending i- yeah.
[2:56:15] <+Shubreaker> important reminder that before BB, Cranston was just the dad from Malcolm in the Middle
[2:56:16] <Sol_Install> spoil from the start
[2:56:19] <%DuskSymphony01> Honestly there are a lot of movies that improve on the second watch since you get to focus on the acting and production details instead of guessing what comes next
[2:56:20] <+BusterRepukken> trap crafting isnt in this season of Fortnite
[2:56:22] <comicalmond9135> @patstaresat yakuza judgment is coming to xbox is it worth playing?
[2:56:24] <Mattais88> Man, I love Twelfth Night.
[2:56:25] <%BubbaRands> End in Tragedy or Happily ever after
[2:56:36] <%Emperor_Machinus> Bad marrige = happy ending?
[2:56:40] <Virokwet> you know whatll happen to deku if you watch the first episode of MHA
[2:56:42] <Kratok> That's because Shakespeare's a hack tho
[2:56:52] <+NickHatesSnow> MacBeth is the worst
[2:56:55] <+MisterRockett> I was a C-section! Yeaaaah!
[2:56:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Macduff was a C Section baby
[2:56:59] <lloyddboy> MacBeth should've been mauled by a dog
[2:57:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Nier Automata gets MASSIVELY recontextualized if you know the big spoiler, and that recontext is way better
[2:57:00] <%foxrock8> don't forget midsummer night's dream ending
[2:57:05] <%ChestMimik> @Kratok Maybe but he's the most famous hack
[2:57:05] <+JobbedBone> mAn bOrN oF wOmAn
[2:57:07] <ohnogino> No shut up, the macbeth twist is good
[2:57:07] <xxshadowxx416> deku a drop out
[2:57:09] <killswitchjohn94> Just look at that PS5 grass
[2:57:12] <%weissguard> @Agami23 and that's a great moment for the reason he goes to that stuff!
[2:57:12] <%ssjklyco> Is  "in media res " technically a spoiler made by the show/game?
[2:57:15] <%saladin1911> Shakespeare's a hack? The fuck is this guy? LUL LUL LUL
[2:57:15] <%walternatorz> I just remember Shakespeare's great twist about the giant flies
[2:57:16] <KeiPrime> i learned macbeth from fucking gargoyles
[2:57:19] <RyuuAoi> @foxrock8 WOW. SPOILER
[2:57:21] <%ElkRiverDog> But it inspire Tolkien so that’s a plus
[2:57:23] <vile_brand> i read macbeth and didnt understand a single thing about it.
[2:57:29] <%hrbeck_> Macbeth is a kojima twist, isn't it?
[2:57:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The thing about old classical theatre is that you have to WATCH it to understand what's happening
[2:57:58] <Devbob98> He’s going change the canon ending I bet
[2:58:00] <ZE_Count> Should I play original Nier or wait for the remake?
[2:58:01] <Saltmeisterr> yo pat did u see himbo Papa Nier?
[2:58:05] <%BoxNavy> im so excited for next week man. thank you for the lp of the original game :)
[2:58:05] <hl98> even the full story is terrible
[2:58:06] <%mormond13> People who get hung up on spoilers are the same people that use cliff notes. if you aren't going to get into any media for the whole ride. why are you even taking part in it
[2:58:10] <comicalmond9135> @patstaresat yakuza judgment is coming to xbox is it worth playing?
[2:58:22] <DianaTheAscian> Just watch clemps videos
[2:58:23] <syanplague> i wonder how that wolf screen is going to happend
[2:58:27] <tukds> Otamata = Sakumoto
[2:58:28] <+polothegreatest> is kojima porting death stranding to xbx?
[2:58:29] <Devbob98> I personal think automata has a strong ending A
[2:58:29] <xxshadowxx416> @comicalmond9135 yes
[2:58:30] <%BoxNavy> good to watch though
[2:58:32] <RyuuAoi> @comicalmond9135 Yes
[2:58:32] <%shad8snake> remake might be different tho, seems like Papa will be there too
[2:58:33] <%ssjklyco> I didn't know about the diffences in the ending until yours and liams LP of it.
[2:58:36] <+eanscrale> That's like all of his games aside from automata
[2:58:39] <Wak033> original nier is a quickbread
[2:58:41] <%Dakuu75> the remake goes for brother-nier instead of papa-nier, right?
[2:58:44] <Mattais88> I'm waiting to see if the gameplay is good before buying
[2:58:45] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> lol imagine literally walking away from Nier Automata thinking Ending A was the real ending. it would be like a 2/10
[2:58:47] <%JoshManVGH> But he also has built a career on writing a story that pretty much requires exhaustive spoilers, for shit you may never see or play.
[2:58:47] <%Taisuru> Drakengard 1 and 3 have stuff goin on with their multiple endings
[2:58:53] <%Aldurin_> Do you think the new Nier will fix the fishing tutorial quest that caused too many people to get stuck?
[2:58:54] <tukds> Is the Nier remake a ff7R?
[2:58:56] <+eanscrale> it's a good recap
[2:58:56] <+chrispunchesboulder> Should I play Replicant or Automata first?
[2:58:59] <comicalmond9135> ok thanks
[2:59:00] <+chaumiester> .... I still don't get Nier's story. So are they in a different world? The soul and body? Can you explain it to me in stupid terms @PatStaresAt
[2:59:02] <Jrocy247> Just like Original Demon Souls
[2:59:07] <+MisterRockett> Is Replicant a Platinum joint?
[2:59:07] <%blistexthief> Raw dog it all the way
[2:59:07] <%VoidBaronJules> getting real ff7re vibes tho
[2:59:07] <%ChestMimik> @CarpeDeezKnuts People HAVE done that tho!
[2:59:10] <vilecrois> I'm not waitin' and gettin spoiled by twitter tbh
[2:59:10] <$RealThiele> r a w Kreygasm
[2:59:12] <+JobbedBone> How will Cliff graduate when people keep stealing his notes BibleThump
[2:59:19] <%JoshManVGH> The gameplay they posted today looked pretty good.
[2:59:21] <syanplague> or watch the old channel playthough
[2:59:30] <RyuuAoi> Raw is best but risky
[2:59:31] <TheSphereHunter> Rep first I'd say just for one part
[2:59:32] <%ssjklyco> Assuming there is no new plot stuff in the remake.
[2:59:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'd say watch an lp of it from one of your favs.
[2:59:34] <TheSphereHunter> Yea
[2:59:35] <Mattais88> Twins get way more tragic
[2:59:35] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> The thing that sucks about McBeth's twist is that it's a technicality.
[2:59:36] <TheSphereHunter> OH YEA
[2:59:37] <DrkJP520> You'll appreciate some stuff in Automata more if you play original Nier first.
[2:59:41] <+Gespens> Automata takes place so far into the future of Replicant/Gestalt, that it is not important to know Replicant/Gestalt
[2:59:41] <+KiwamiKiryu> The old channel LP was really good, made me buy the game and re play it myself on PS3
[2:59:43] <Devbob98> They’re so far apart
[2:59:54] <%Dakuu75> dude, Pat has been walking around for like 10 minutes without finding anyone. all these kids hidding in houses?
[2:59:58] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> What about that FFXIV raid thingy?
[3:00:01] <%Fooguwu> You'll feel very confused at some parts in automata though
[3:00:01] <+JobbedBone> wow ho
[3:00:02] <%blistexthief> We are friends now
[3:00:03] <+BIumen> yeah the old LP of it was very well done with the editing for the subsequent runs
[3:00:03] <%ChestMimik> LOL
[3:00:06] <+StickonATree> that poor child
[3:00:06] <%Dakuu75> -nvm
[3:00:07] <Silvance> Silvance subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:00:07] <Jrocy247> WOW HO
[3:00:12] <greencapps> Did you hear that Replicant will have new story content and a new boss
[3:00:12] <%BubbaRands> HAWKEYE PAT
[3:00:14] <%baka_sugoi> psaDab
[3:00:14] <DracaenaLeaf> i have drakengard 3 on my screen right now :)
[3:00:14] <Wak033> get in that ass
[3:00:16] <%Aldurin_> carpet bomb the child
[3:00:17] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> LIke, ok Bill, I think yer being a little pedantic there
[3:00:19] <%twistedj3ster> Pat, think of the children...and then kill them
[3:00:22] <%DedlokPM> So "!wow hO"?
[3:00:24] <ZE_Count> So the bow works like the gears of war one?
[3:00:28] <Devbob98> Child didn’t even move
[3:00:30] <%thesaltiestscrublord> psaDown
[3:00:32] <+Das_Prints> Hell of a shot.
[3:00:38] <+chrispunchesboulder> Thanks for the detailed answer to my question!
[3:00:39] <%DuskSymphony01> I played automata first and there was only like one room where  I was confused by lack of og nier context
[3:00:42] <%iroh20> nice try
[3:00:54] <%Boxortoo> real sweat
[3:00:56] <%dork_doggler> The best thing about MacBeth's ending is it inspired rthe ents storming isengard
[3:00:59] <RyuuAoi> Ambushed
[3:01:00] <%VoidBaronJules> hey Suzi
[3:01:01] <ohnogino> @PatStaresAt How do the PS5 special triggers feel with this game?

[3:08:58] <+JobbedBone> @milhousego something somewhere has probably made the connection between the matrix and alice in wonderland, but I was joking
[3:09:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The twins fuckin broke my goddamn heart in Automata
[3:09:04] <DrkJP520> Speaking of spoilers, I searched for the JoJo part 6 anime teaser on youtube, and after watching it, part 6 spoilers started appearing on my fuckin' home page. Careful, people

[3:12:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> But what about Terragrigia Pat?
[3:12:43] <Devbob98> She’s Paige
[3:12:52] <Jogsy29__> Wesker's horny for global saturation= RE 5
[3:12:55] <%ChestMimik> They took Pyramid Head's ass off from DbD and it grew into Lady D
[3:13:03] <%baka_sugoi> zombie 4.0
[3:13:09] <%BubbaRands> It's just Wesker in a wig LUL
[3:13:11] <+JobbedBone> at the end of pokemon you return home to find your mother has early stage alzheimer's. You swallow your pride and give up adventure to care for her
[3:13:12] <Devbob98> Witch hunter umbrella
[3:13:14] <%BigCoffee> Spencer dated Lady D 80 years ago and he made umbrella from them
[3:13:17] <tukds> Pat have you seen the RE8 spoilers yet?
[3:13:18] <Lancaster_H> remember guys Africa is the birthplace of evil in REverse
[3:13:19] <$RealThiele> im willing to allow big mommy milkers umbrella
[3:13:27] <%Monkeyweed21> thats where Dante and Vergil were born
[3:13:29] <Devbob98> It’s Spencer’s grandfather or something
[3:13:30] <%mormond13> Wesker was Jean Parmesan all along
[3:13:33] <%Boxortoo> LOL
[3:13:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That one's too good.
[3:13:38] <+JustToWatch> the U in Umbrella stands for Strand

[3:14:04] <%baka_sugoi> wesker on stilts
[3:14:05] <%BigCoffee> Hey remember Wesker's Sister? Who possessed the loli in Rev 2? And now she's just....gone?
[3:14:07] <@SoFarFetched> My guess for who the Resident Evil survivor is, Im putting my money on Rebecca. Because that would explain why she's been MIA LUL
[3:14:08] <%hrbeck_> wesker needs the big booba to trick chris redfield into continuing the redfield bloodline
[3:14:13] <hl98> maybe don't think too hard about a videogame story
[3:14:13] <Devbob98> Man wesker is looking good
[3:14:13] <+glgzephyr> I would be disappointed if she were Wesker
[3:14:15] <%Dakuu75> Mrs. Big Mommy Milkers
[3:14:16] <%ForlornCarton> What is the chance that Ethan Winters is Ethan Wesker?
[3:14:17] <vilecrois> Do think hard about it, but in a different way
[3:14:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Wesker cloned himself into a giant busty vampire woman, more likely than you think!
[3:14:20] <marvel877> If that happens, can't wait to see Mike over at YoVideogames dress the part...
[3:14:24] <%bmoral64> Lady D is Weskers Mom
[3:14:24] <Mattais88> Unless it's an inherited title
[3:14:25] <theosmeo> meanwhile that dude is dantes cousin
[3:14:29] <%Cozy90> that re4 vr announcement was abit disappointing
[3:14:33] <Jogsy29__> Lady D is just Claire mutating into menopaused state
[3:14:38] <%Monkeyweed21> how is Chris going to be not evil this time?
[3:14:46] <marvel877> @GarbageQueenEllie Worked for Seth in Street Fighter!
[3:14:54] <%BigCoffee> @Monkeyweed21 what if he finally is evil
[3:14:55] <%saladin1911> What the hell is Jill doing in RE lore after RE5?

[3:20:24] <KeiPrime> you're not a dish, you're a man
[3:20:25] <+JobbedBone> Loot crate was helped by hapless relatives who don't know what gift to get
[3:20:46] <%BubbaRands> @YakumoYomi Honestly probably the most effective advertising ever.
[3:20:49] <+JobbedBone> "oh get him the gaming lootcrate he likes games"
[3:20:54] <+glgzephyr> @KasiCrafter The thing about a subscription-based service that sends you random bullshit is that eventually your subscribers *run out of room in their domiciles*

[3:24:18] <%shad8snake> CDs?

[3:24:45] <DianaTheAscian> @Boxortoo ....k?
[3:24:48] <%BubbaRands> Legitimately feared for her life during that album
[3:24:48] <Zebens> the angriest album for the angriest pat
[3:24:51] <%ssjklyco> Some Japan or Korean companies have a clause that allow you to request a day off if your favorite band/idol leaves

[3:25:22] <Devbob98> He legally got away with it too

[3:26:38] <Devbob98> Do they? I thought it was used as an insult
[3:26:39] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> Yeah but "fan" means "fanatic" anyway. Language evolves
[3:26:40] <%logoth_> I hate the word Stan
[3:26:41] <+glgzephyr> I have no idea where stan even comes from
[3:26:41] <TurtlesAndTentacles> the term Stan is really stupid

[3:26:47] <+glgzephyr> that's why I don't use the word

[3:29:23] <+BusterRepukken> @kewlmyc that means literally nothing
[3:29:28] <+glgzephyr> recasting is not the same thing as making a different character BP
[3:29:29] <vilecrois> puppeteering his corpse isn't better than recasting
[3:29:30] <%walternatorz> they can't edward norton jr him
[3:29:30] <+SargentToughie> They already did it once when they got Don Cheadle
[3:29:31] <Virokwet> do they have to call it it out mid movie?
[3:29:32] <$RealThiele> multiverse black panther as michael b jordan it could work
[3:29:33] <xxshadowxx416> OLNY CG HIM
[3:29:36] <Explodincatz> just res the actor from the dead

[3:29:50] <%mormond13> Just bruce lee it and airbrush his head over a body double actor
[3:29:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> The Title name. They arent Recasting TChalla
[3:29:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Just CGI a scene of Black Panther dying during Endgame
[3:29:55] <+glgzephyr> they're just going to have a funeral for the character then move on with the sister. Done deal
[3:30:00] <+kewlmyc> @BusterRepukken Feige saying "we won't recast Black Panther" means nothing?

[3:33:54] <Devbob98> What could V stand for?
[3:33:54] <leinadtonu> loud sweating ensues
[3:33:55] <%ssjklyco> It's kinda obvious in the trailer though.
[3:33:57] <%bustawof> max pretty much found vergil from the reveale trailer LUL
[3:34:03] <GoodnightSnek> I love how it was so obviously virgil the community had to convince themselves it wasn't virgil prior to release
[3:34:10] <hl98> why are we bullying woolie again
[3:34:15] <DianaTheAscian> Woolei can't guess for shit
[3:34:19] <%BigCoffee> LUL

[3:34:26] <%doomunderthestairs> waiting
[3:34:28] <%ChestMimik> He tries to big brain and plays himself
[3:34:29] <KeiPrime> when are we not bully woolie
[3:34:30] <Mattais88> PLAY IT SUZI
[3:34:30] <CrimsonFox777> @hl98 Why not?
[3:34:35] <Broken_Sonex> @hl98 We don't need a reason
[3:34:36] <%baka_sugoi> suzi's lvl POG
[3:34:38] <LorcaNomad> watched the full LP, can confirm
[3:34:39] <%walternatorz> @hl98 woolie turned down pat's offer to play fortnite
[3:34:39] <Devbob98> @hl98 this is what happens without  the shitstorm
[3:34:45] <%YakumoYomi> PSA: Go buy 13 Sentinels
[3:34:46] <+dereksbales> booli madden
[3:34:48] <MuffinMastr> in a rare case i didnt watch that playthrough cause i didnt want spoilers ahaha. game looks GOOD
[3:34:50] <$RealThiele> (X)
[3:34:52] <leinadtonu> boolie the woolie friday's
[3:34:53] <%weissguard> He spends a lot of time to just speculate and Galaxy Brain, only to be  told otherwise by the game LUL
[3:34:54] <%Boxortoo> LOL
[3:34:55] <%hrbeck_> he has weakened himself to make himself immune to spoilers, pat
[3:34:55] <Explodincatz> @BusterRepukken thats every day
[3:34:56] <%Boxortoo> holy shit
[3:34:58] <%Jamejarrs> I still need to beat it, but so far I've never seen something drop bombs chapter after chapter like it
[3:35:00] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah go buy 13 Sentinels
[3:35:01] <Zebens> LUL
[3:35:07] <LorcaNomad> amazing
[3:35:09] <+JobbedBone> I don't care about guessing, but I think having an untainted, pure experience like you get at a movie is special
[3:35:15] <+kewlmyc> 1 hour analysis that gets disproven 2 minutes afterward. That was Woolie's 13 Sentinels playthrough in a nutshell.
[3:35:16] <T_Sasquatch> @hl98 sbfp is built on the foundation of bullying woolie LUL
[3:35:24] <%blistexthief> Slick fashion sense, that guy
[3:35:25] <ZE_Count> IS IT ON PC YET?
[3:35:33] <%doomunderthestairs> not yet
[3:35:37] <%hrbeck_> @JobbedBone you're wrong, but fine
[3:35:41] <DianaTheAscian> how many copies has it sold now?
[3:35:42] <%Boxortoo> Yeah woolie the killer and pie stealer were like the biggest memes for awhile
[3:35:45] <LailahQueenx> LUL
[3:35:47] <ZE_Count> Disco is my game of the year
[3:35:48] <%Boxortoo> back in the sbfp days

[3:35:57] <%doomunderthestairs> vanillaware hasn't been great about PC ports though
[3:35:57] <%BigDumBeak> I just beat 13 sentinals last night, LOVED it
[3:36:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Devil May Cry 5
[3:36:05] <hl98> smart move
[3:36:05] <%blistexthief> Do you think Woolie's hatred of spoilers stem from his inability to read?
[3:36:06] <%YakumoYomi> And it got robbed by TLoU2 at the Game Awards for "Best Narrative"
[3:36:09] <+JobbedBone> @hrbeck_ I'm wrong about what I care about?
[3:36:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Blacklisted
[3:36:16] <leinadtonu> a wise business move
[3:36:16] <$RealThiele> the himbo character in 13 <3
[3:36:16] <ThirdPersonPhil> Shadow banned
[3:36:16] <DianaTheAscian> and Pat is now black listed
[3:36:16] <%MechArch> to be fair it shit on itself
[3:36:18] <Zantetzuken> #blacklisted
[3:36:32] <+BusterRepukken> sony also loves killing old things
[3:36:35] <%Taisuru> Good riddance
[3:36:39] <%logoth_> no God of War 2 early access for you
[3:36:39] <Broken_Sonex> @blistexthief Absolutely
[3:36:40] <LailahQueenx> #bannedbysony
[3:36:43] <Mattais88> They are a movie studio
[3:36:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Big boy companies don't wanna play your games LUL
[3:36:46] <%Boxortoo> I'm surprised you still have a creator code even after shitting on Tim The Rat Sweeney
[3:36:48] <Devbob98> The cool kids list
[3:36:54] <%Cozy90> sony hates fun
[3:36:55] <+BusterRepukken> PS5 is the HBO console
[3:37:02] <%hrbeck_> @JobbedBone you are wrong to think it is special, it's a thing you prefer and that's all
[3:37:02] <%shad8snake> thats a good way of putting it
[3:37:03] <%baka_sugoi> evo15MindBlown
[3:37:04] <%YakumoYomi> Especially with regard to TLoU2. Sony/ND were bending over backwards to defend that game from anyone critical of it.
[3:37:11] <+Shubreaker> the quintessential vn
[3:37:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> What genre?
[3:37:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Visual novel or RTS?
[3:37:23] <%Dakuu75> wtf kind of dragon wings are those
[3:37:29] <%BigCoffee> yeah but tlou2 still sold like 10 mill :/
[3:37:31] <%doomunderthestairs> Hijiyima is the 13 senitinel himbo and is the same english va as in himbo Ichiban in Yakuza 7
[3:37:33] <+BusterRepukken> @YakumoYomi they were winning awards left and right yet kept calling regular Joe Schmoe on twitter for criticing it
[3:37:37] <%Deft_Thought> Nah man, Melty Blood is the Visual Novel quantum leap
[3:37:42] <Devbob98> Suzi going make a 13 sentinels video now
[3:37:47] <%Monkeyweed21> its a Sci Fi mystery
[3:37:52] <hl98> danganronpa
[3:37:57] <%BigCoffee> It's inception-grade of spoils, the spoilers have more layers then it should be possible
[3:38:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Visual novel unfortunately not hold my attention well
[3:38:06] <vilecrois> If you try to spoil 13 sentinels people will think you're pulling a "mew is hiding under the truck" sort of lie
[3:38:12] <%logoth_> Ppaaaaatt~
[3:38:13] <LorcaNomad> stop being bad at
[3:38:13] <%ChestMimik> The children are stealing Pat's milk money
[3:38:28] <%Boxortoo> Pat getting shaken down by the school bully
[3:38:29] <%saladin1911> @hrbeck_ It was explicitly the dudes own opinion from the start. Why be an elitist asshole based around subjective experience?
[3:38:30] <+JobbedBone> @hrbeck_ special is so vague that trying to refute this is pretty cringe bro
[3:38:50] <leinadtonu> These children are aggressive
[3:38:55] <%hrbeck_> oh no, I'll lose followers
[3:39:02] <tukds> oh god no
[3:39:07] <Jrocy247> I agree but I don't agree with that
[3:39:09] <%YakumoYomi> @BusterRepukken It was the weirdest thing. Despite all the awards, they were going out of their way to try and discredit ALL criticism. Yet, with Ghost of Tsushima, they just let the game stand on its own.
[3:39:09] <%Dakuu75> Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you
[3:39:10] <DianaTheAscian> is that a warframe?
[3:39:12] <%ChestMimik> Ace Attounrey?
[3:39:33] <$RealThiele> hatoful boyfriend
[3:39:34] <DrkJP520> Play the Zero Escape series.
[3:39:35] <Devbob98> Not even DDLC
[3:39:44] <Lancaster_H> i thought everyone played Bible Black
[3:39:49] <Mattais88> Hotel Dusk
[3:39:52] <%Taisuru> Fuckin love Ace Attorney
[3:39:53] <%BubbaRands> No You! Don't type Fate!
[3:39:53] <+JustToWatch> oh shit Kamiya just retweeted Suzi's cosplay
[3:39:54] <LorcaNomad> ace attorney is a great VN
[3:39:57] <leinadtonu> Pat's about to introduce Suzie to otomes...
[3:40:01] <%BubbaRands> You know who you are!
[3:40:06] <%shad8snake> i wish i could play through them again!
[3:40:07] <hl98> danganronpa is the only vn that matters
[3:40:07] <+polothegreatest> pwaa series are great
[3:40:10] <DickieWoodsmall_279> are we still doing "the children" bit? is it still funny? should I make a joke about children playing the video game?
[3:40:12] <$RealThiele> its sooo good
[3:40:12] <+DrZanzabar> Death Mark
[3:40:13] <Cravemaster> Spirit  Hunter Death Mark
[3:40:17] <+Shubreaker> OOOOO
[3:40:17] <%ChestMimik> You could easily play the first two in a couple days
[3:40:26] <LailahQueenx> hotel dusk
[3:40:30] <+BusterRepukken> the slurm chicken
[3:40:30] <%ExpressNode> I was just playing Apollo Justice.
[3:40:30] <%YakumoYomi> Eat your hamburgers, Apollo
[3:40:32] <DianaTheAscian> ew
[3:40:34] <ergulor> Danganronpa is way better than zero escape (Ai the somiun files is great tho9
[3:40:35] <supergoblinpunch> Hotel Dusk and Last Window are really good.
[3:40:39] <+polothegreatest> even the fan translations
[3:40:40] <syanplague> even the "recent" Ace attorney games are good
[3:40:40] <CrimsonFox777> Why does that bird have "SLURP" on its butt?
[3:40:41] <Saltmeisterr> except the last zero escape game
[3:40:42] <+DrZanzabar> NG, Raging Loop
[3:40:44] <tukds> "Game" VLR and especially ZTD are just jokes at this point
[3:40:51] <+JobbedBone> layton was so comfy
[3:40:53] <BigHugs> Yeah Cing super dead
[3:40:54] <%AzureGale> F
[3:40:57] <+JustToWatch> I think I played the first Ace Attorney as an ipod game
[3:40:57] <GoodnightSnek> Zero Escape fans wake up we've been acknowledged!!!
[3:41:01] <PartyFavors> Raging Loop is terrible
[3:41:02] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yeah, Cing went bankrupt
[3:41:07] <LorcaNomad> VA-11 Hall-A is also a fucking banger of a VN
[3:41:08] <tukds> Complex motives
[3:41:10] <ThirdPersonPhil> Is to the Moon a visual novel? and if not what is it then?
[3:41:16] <%shad8snake> there are dozens of us, Zero Escape fans!
[3:41:21] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Hotel Dusk and Trace Memory were set in the same world.
[3:41:22] <%weissguard> Zero Escape games?
[3:41:25] <DrkJP520> You said Zero Escape something
[3:41:29] <%weissguard> Think that was it?
[3:41:35] <+DrZanzabar> Tsukihime
[3:41:40] <+Shubreaker> pat has become blug, the chugger of jugs
[3:41:43] <hl98> @justtowatch, I played the first trilogy on my moms phone
[3:41:47] <Cravemaster> Death Mark and NG are great
[3:41:48] <PartyFavors> Danganronpa has some serious fundamental issues but also a lot of interesting stuff and is one of the last few fully proper closed circle mysteries
[3:41:49] <%Dakuu75> jesus, these revives take forever
[3:41:50] <Devbob98> Pat blocked suzi from leaving lol
[3:41:54] <PartyFavors> Zero Escape is spectacular
[3:42:02] <+DrZanzabar> Steins;Gate
[3:42:06] <hl98> Danganronpa has better waifus
[3:42:09] <tukds> No VLR wasn't fine, it was a massive cliffhanger that caused fans to cry for a decade
[3:42:10] <%saladin1911> Suzi hasn't played a single VN, no problem. Woolie hasn't played the Arkham games, he's fucking crazy! psaHoldon
[3:42:11] <dmtjinni> is this the 2nd podcast?
[3:42:15] <Devbob98> Steins gate is the shit
[3:42:16] <%shad8snake> Pat likes yakuza?
[3:42:25] <+JustToWatch> @hl98 lol good to know I didn't hallucinate that
[3:42:31] <%Cozy90> ive only played 7 and i love it
[3:42:39] <%twistedj3ster> I burned out at 5
[3:42:41] <DrkJP520> Virtue's Last Reward ends on a stinger/cliffhanger
[3:42:57] <%bustawof> oh yeah
[3:43:00] <Broken_Sonex> @saladin1911 It's called double standard and it's fine if it's Woolie
[3:43:02] <%shad8snake> people fucking die

[3:43:21] <+MackFighters> I'm so excited for the ps5 version of judgement next week
[3:43:23] <%bustawof> I can't wait for judgment 2
[3:43:26] <dragoon001914> It's fine, they're just rubber bullets :^)
[3:43:29] <%Lion_kun> That shit with the window was sick
[3:43:38] <aero160h> it ends in a cool way lol

[3:44:09] <%bustawof> bad guy was a BAD GUY
[3:44:11] <%saladin1911> @broken_sonex Yeah LUL Woolie says and does some dumb shit but people constantly shit on him over non-issues and I don't get it lmfao
[3:44:15] <+JustToWatch> aside from that part where Kiryu was shooting down helicopters with rpgs over crowded city streets
[3:44:22] <+MisterRockett> Cause they know they CAN'T
[3:44:22] <aero160h> he literally becomes a Baine boss
[3:44:27] <$RealThiele> those non-serious ILL KILL YOUs
[3:44:30] <%Dakuu75> plot armor
[3:44:39] <iosephe> Judgment 2 when
[3:44:41] <VritraReiRei> SPOILERS D:
[3:44:47] <%ChestMimik> How many games kill their protagonists anyways?
[3:44:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh we got Suzi on board?
[3:44:51] <%shad8snake> Judgment 2 is coming
[3:44:54] <+chaumiester> ...... Are you talking about Paige or Woolie?
[3:44:54] <Lancaster_H> @saladin1911 a better comparison would be if suzi was a big fan of the VN genre and hasnt touched any Ace Attorney games
[3:44:57] <thatlolifrompersona1> Games old anyway
[3:45:00] <%BigCoffee> Wait are you saying Woolie isn't a human?!
[3:45:04] <%valriot> I never understood the idea of "Person didnt die, so theres no tension", you can have tension and everyone survive
[3:45:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Who cares. Just  spoil it all
[3:45:06] <hl98> bully :(
[3:45:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> Suzi looked dope as Bayo
[3:45:08] <%Dakuu75> don't say his name. you mgiht summon him
[3:45:10] <%Monkeyweed21> yea PAIGE
[3:45:22] <Devbob98> Elmo?
[3:45:28] <%BigCoffee> Try the House in Fata Morgana (it's on the switch now!)
[3:45:37] <Broken_Sonex> @saladin1911 Also VN aren't really a thing a lot of people are interested in
[3:45:42] <+JobbedBone> NO START WITH KATAWA SHOUJO
[3:45:43] <%MidnightBurst12> Elmo HATES spoilers
[3:45:45] <%ChestMimik> Are they translating Great Ace Attorney yet?
[3:45:49] <%Monkeyweed21> 13 sentinels AA and 999 are the big ones, with Steins Gate on the side
[3:45:50] <LorcaNomad> Is Disco Elysium a VN because of the Final Cut?
[3:45:52] <+glgzephyr> 13 sentinels is more of a side scrolling adventure game than it is vn
[3:45:57] <ManaSpurt> That skin makin me thirsty.
[3:46:06] <%BigCoffee> @LorcaNomad No it's still a rpg
[3:46:11] <GoodnightSnek> Speaking of Visual Novels how about that Silver Case: 25th Ward Kappa
[3:46:24] <%saladin1911> @lancaster_h but Pat made the point that they're tangential to a genre that she does love. Also, an ENTIRE genre. I don't have a problem with her missing out, my point is that people just don't get around to obvious things sometimes.
[3:46:26] <%Monkeyweed21> 2-4 is the best case in the series
[3:46:27] <%BigCoffee> @GoodnightSnek wait for the switch release
[3:46:29] <%Dakuu75> stolen? from where, like... your work locker back int he grocery store days?
[3:46:32] <RyuuAoi> On the bus ha
[3:46:40] <syanplague> Have you played the 3DS ones?
[3:46:41] <leinadtonu> a sound strategy
[3:46:42] <%ExpressNode> Yeah my memory got corrupted for the trilogy on 3DS and I didn't touch the games bfor 5 years
[3:46:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Justice for all kinda sucks BUT THAT LAST CASE THO
[3:46:57] <hl98> Suda51 pog
[3:47:01] <+JobbedBone> art cop day 1 is insane
[3:47:05] <LailahQueenx> in justice we trust
[3:47:15] <%valriot> I got the Emerald Weapon mount, 14 is now 2000% better cos i never have to run that garbage ass fight
[3:47:15] <syanplague> like Dual destines and spirit of justice?
[3:47:15] <dmtjinni> LUL
[3:47:17] <%BigCoffee> @JobbedBone how do you get it
[3:47:20] <RyuuAoi> Pat is in training mode
[3:47:23] <%MidnightBurst12> instant house
[3:47:25] <ZE_Count> build a house around you
[3:47:25] <%hrbeck_> oh pat
[3:47:29] <supergoblinpunch> Chicken Arise
[3:47:37] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:47:41] <+DinnerCalzone> they put him in gbj
[3:47:43] <@SoFarFetched> Justice for All had such a short development time.
[3:47:44] <Devbob98> That was amazing
[3:47:44] <%Dakuu75> one shot
[3:47:47] <+traximus_s> T R A S H!!!
[3:47:47] <RyuuAoi> BUILD
[3:47:54] <%Cozy90> is that like a buy back?
[3:48:03] <%BigCoffee> @valriot was it that bad? cause I gotta do it...
[3:48:03] <+DrZanzabar> Macrod a house on pat
[3:48:05] <Lancaster_H> @saladin1911 thats fair, but you have to admit being a huge metroidvania fan and a decent comic book fan and not touching arkham for 11 years is not the same thing compared to a genre like VNs
[3:48:07] <%Dakuu75> minimap too, yeah?
[3:48:14] <+glgzephyr> did they copy that from Apex too? LUL
[3:48:24] <%ChestMimik> JFA's last case is top 3 in the whole series
[3:48:26] <LorcaNomad> @glgzephyr yes
[3:48:27] <Devbob98> Suzi back is going break from this carry
[3:48:29] <hl98> who is suzy
[3:48:31] <ThirdPersonPhil> the ones outside the circle works still
[3:48:35] <+JobbedBone> @BigCoffee theres a set of interactions you can do early that get you enough points to unlock it. theres guides
[3:48:36] <%Cozy90> Suzy floss all over those kids
[3:48:46] <%weissguard> Bridge to the Turnabout (?) I think was that last case in AA 3, and BOY, was that worth it. Especially for that one thing coming back.
[3:48:55] <%valriot> @valriot Its just a time consuming fight, its so boring
[3:48:56] <ItIsSky> The reboot vans were like one or two months after apex was released
[3:49:05] <%Cozy90> ARE CAWN DOO THEWS
[3:49:10] <%BigCoffee> @JobbedBone does it change your words and itneractions a lot? I'm trying to be a magic inner empire cop
[3:49:12] <LorcaNomad> LUL
[3:49:12] <hl98> gamer
[3:49:15] <%Cozy90> AYE*
[3:49:20] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[3:49:21] <nevan_44> LUL
[3:49:21] <Broken_Sonex> She IS dumb tbf
[3:49:24] <Devbob98> Pat preachy? No!
[3:49:24] <%saladin1911> @lancaster_h Yes and no. I'm not super into RPGs, VNs, or murder mysteries and yet even I've played a handful of VNs.
[3:49:29] <dragoon001914> Like all the death scenes for Lara?
[3:49:31] <+MisterRockett> Lara and her 5 dads!
[3:49:32] <%ChestMimik> BUT YOU WANT TO PROTECT HER THO
[3:49:36] <+polothegreatest> i despise ch2 of jfa and the samurai one
[3:49:38] <%Monkeyweed21> the Guro tag is STRONG
[3:49:44] <hl98> that was their fetish
[3:49:44] <Devbob98> The death scenes are gross
[3:49:45] <+Shubreaker> they love beating the fuck outta Lara
[3:49:47] <%valriot> PROTECT. LARA.
[3:49:47] <SpaceManHotepIV> mamoru~
[3:49:48] <ItIsSky> there was that and the first trailers
[3:49:50] <leinadtonu> not the game as much as the way they present it
[3:50:00] <LorcaNomad> monkaS
[3:50:03] <%BigCoffee> Lara has a body count in the triple digits
[3:50:05] <Broken_Sonex> IMPALED THROUGH THE MOUTH BY A SPIKE
[3:50:07] <PanicSwytch> Always Zig zag
[3:50:07] <fatlystackedmac> it made me scared of rebar lol
[3:50:09] <$RealThiele> torture porn
[3:50:15] <%ChestMimik> "Misogyny is hilarious" -Pat
[3:50:18] <hl98> quiet breathing through her skin
[3:50:18] <Shinning_Tiger> Bro you have a creator code? Hell yeah
[3:50:23] <iosephe> Even Pat
[3:50:36] <Devbob98> That’s a hell of a quote Pat
[3:50:39] <+DrZanzabar> Gold gun
[3:50:42] <Lancaster_H> mamoru with a dash of ryona
[3:50:42] <%blistexthief> THE BABY
[3:50:50] <leinadtonu> You know  the bad kind of misogyny
[3:50:52] <+JobbedBone> @BigCoffee it gives you bonus for some int passives, doesn't override anything
[3:50:53] <RyuuAoi> WHENS THIRD BIRTHDAY?
[3:50:54] <DavidSanChan> lara croft huh, let's mislodge her knee
[3:51:11] <Broken_Sonex> @Lancaster_H It's devs favourite genre
[3:51:11] <GoodnightSnek> Some of those game over screens in TR reboot were REAL uncomfortable
[3:51:12] <%hrbeck_> "Here's this kitten. Do you love it? Would you love it more if we hurt it?"
[3:51:21] <T_Sasquatch> ITS VERY CREEPY
[3:51:27] <%Monkeyweed21> its some Shadman Shindol shit
[3:51:29] <%BigCoffee> @JobbedBone So its broken?
[3:51:29] <Devbob98> That almost rape scene was so gross
[3:51:30] <%baka_sugoi> vore
[3:51:31] <Shardlab> Someone was a hardcore guro fan
[3:51:34] <+glgzephyr> IT'S STILL THERE
[3:51:35] <%Ynkubus_> It was a little snuff-ish for some reason
[3:51:35] <%ChestMimik> Mortal Kombat was less into the gore
[3:51:37] <+Shubreaker> then they tuned it back up in the third
[3:51:42] <+MisterRockett> To be fair, you could make the argument that she had some gruesome deaths in the originals for the time.
[3:51:43] <Ravioli_Ronin> Like dead space or RE4?
[3:51:45] <T_Sasquatch> It was pure guro
[3:51:49] <leinadtonu> it was on the level of what Isaac Clark went through, but they made it gross
[3:51:51] <Broken_Sonex> That one where she gets a big spike through her mouth was REALLLLLY oooof
[3:51:55] <%weissguard> And then you gun down 100s of dudes
[3:52:18] <Devbob98> Not having double guns until end drove me wild
[3:52:30] <T_Sasquatch> @MisterRockett yes but those games didnt make it cinematic to the point of multiple seconds of animation showin her struggle to die
[3:52:31] <+polothegreatest> bow and arrow only
[3:52:36] <%Cozy90> when Conan o Brian played the game and he got her stuck in a death loop and the audience is loosing their shit made me laugh so hard. The audience was horrified.
[3:52:43] <%TheLakinessMonster> It seems like the level of violence exponentially jumps past the narrative.
[3:52:49] <%saladin1911> I think that first Tomb Raider reboot game is largely meh, the sequal is fucking awesome tho.
[3:52:49] <$RealThiele> the 2nd new tomb raider is not great either
[3:52:49] <hl98> LUL
[3:53:01] <LorcaNomad> LUL
[3:53:05] <hl98> that's what happens when videogames try to be deep
[3:53:06] <%BigCoffee> tonal dissonance
[3:53:06] <T_Sasquatch> nu-tomb raider just isnt good
[3:53:09] <%BigCoffee> like TLOU2
[3:53:13] <vilecrois> That's some tonal dissonance
[3:53:14] <%baka_sugoi> TRASH
[3:53:15] <+MisterRockett> @T_Sasquatch True I do think they went too far but there's precedent for there BEING death animations at all. I hated them too tho.
[3:53:22] <T_Sasquatch> they removed her dual wield pistols to give her A FUCKING BOW
[3:53:23] <%Dakuu75> feel bad about killing... also, kill them all. TLOU motto
[3:53:27] <xxshadowxx416> 2000 TOMB RAIDER WAS FUN
[3:53:27] <+JustToWatch> that's some heavy Ludo narrative dissonance right there
[3:53:28] <ytbmorales> Revenge is bad >:(((( @BigCoffee
[3:53:29] <%JoshManVGH> How DARE you make Laura do this.
[3:53:31] <%BigCoffee> Ellie don't kill people! Revenge is bad! Proceed to murder 100 people
[3:53:32] <T_Sasquatch> they made her iconic weapon a BOWWWW
[3:53:33] <+Saggitori> ludonarrative dissonance
[3:53:36] <Devbob98> They took the adventure out of the game
[3:53:38] <Jaysky> lirikTHUMP But stab is bad
[3:53:47] <%Noir_Valdr> it's a good game but it has some serious tonal dissonance
[3:53:49] <%Monkeyweed21> SHIT SQUARE ENIX
[3:53:51] <Garrison27> What was it called? Ludo-narrative dissonance?
[3:53:53] <cis_eraser_420> at least lara doesn't do weird moans all the time
[3:53:54] <%Noir_Valdr> Tomb Raider I mean
[3:53:56] <SpaceManHotepIV> hmmmm
[3:53:56] <%ChestMimik> WOOF
[3:53:57] <%AzureGale> BRUH
[3:53:58] <$RealThiele> actual dissonance
[3:53:58] <hl98> wtf is third birthday
[3:53:59] <Ravioli_Ronin> Games like that should be smart enough to not even try that
[3:54:01] <dmtjinni> is fortnite actually good? I\m confused
[3:54:02] <+JobbedBone> OwO
[3:54:03] <LorcaNomad> are you fucking kidding me
[3:54:05] <%Noir_Valdr> 3rd Birthday is utter garbo
[3:54:06] <VritraReiRei> DansGame
[3:54:09] <+traximus_s> thats creepy
[3:54:12] <KeiPrime> and they gave that guy final fantasy
[3:54:14] <%ExpressNode> Did they want a horror game or porn?
[3:54:14] <%Monkeyweed21> UUUUUUGGGG
[3:54:14] <+Quack_of_Dawn> DM, I don't want to go through the piss forest
[3:54:15] <Shardlab> Thanks Sessler
[3:54:18] <T_Sasquatch> @BigCoffee Game about revenge, doesnt do the revenge to the person that literally started the revenge train
[3:54:19] <KeiPrime> for a bit, fucking 13 series
[3:54:20] <%BigCoffee> Nackey Jackey's TLOU2 video is one of the best thing I've seen in a while
[3:54:22] <Broken_Sonex> At that point why not just make it a porn game?
[3:54:29] <+SoySocks> Uncharted 2 popularized it, but doesn't fit the original definition
[3:54:30] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the interupt between the tone of the gameplay and the tone of the story
[3:54:34] <RyuuAoi> Pat should stare at it
[3:54:39] <ZE_Count> I mean Indiana jones killed a decent amount fo people
[3:54:43] <$RealThiele> use the white phosphorus nathan!
[3:54:48] <cis_eraser_420> hey! you can see one of the guys swimming away!
[3:54:48] <Devbob98> Nathan destroyed so much history
[3:54:52] <%AzureGale> The guard swims away though
[3:54:53] <%MelBrooksKA> What the fuck is Pat's character
[3:54:55] <vilecrois> And that's why spiderman auto-webs people now when he tosses them
[3:54:59] <Dwarven_Gaming> and they were NAZIS
[3:54:59] <Shardlab> And Nathan goes to jail for it
[3:55:00] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Most of them were nazis
[3:55:01] <+traximus_s> I don't mind clothes break but shit man
[3:55:02] <+NickHatesSnow> AND THEY WERE NAZIS
[3:55:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> So whacky
[3:55:03] <LorcaNomad> there's no comparison
[3:55:04] <+polothegreatest> tlous2 would it be a better game if ellie wasnt the protag, you know, expanding the lore
[3:55:05] <Mattais88> And they were 90% Nazis
[3:55:05] <leinadtonu> treating people like goombas in mario
[3:55:06] <ZE_Count> also like half of those were nazi
[3:55:07] <KeiPrime> lot of those guys indy killed were nazis
[3:55:10] <%Ynkubus_> Most were Nazis
[3:55:10] <%DuskSymphony01> The security guards were a bit much, but most of those enemies were literally soldiers working for a warlord that razed a few city blocks to the ground
[3:55:11] <+JustToWatch> also they were Nazis
[3:55:12] <+Shubreaker> and they were NAZIS
[3:55:12] <%AzureGale> Oh
[3:55:14] <RyuuAoi> 3rd Birthday
[3:55:16] <Devbob98> Fuck nazis though
[3:55:16] <cis_eraser_420> but yeah it's a valid point of critique but it got mega overused
[3:55:18] <+MisterRockett> Ludo-narrative dissonance was ORIGINALLY about Bioshock but people take it to say games are bad for being games, which is the issue people have with it now.
[3:55:19] <%TheLakinessMonster> Indiana Jones also fought people who HAD to go
[3:55:21] <FuzzTime> Also 60% of the people Indy killed were Nazis lol
[3:55:23] <%Cozy90> shooting nazis is ok
[3:55:24] <+Funkbuster_G> @MelBrooksKA Blue chicken.
[3:55:28] <KeiPrime> nazis or child slavers
[3:55:37] <BigNerdSam> What Fortnite Fridays is real??
[3:55:38] <Broken_Sonex> @AzureGale Wasn't in the original game. That was a patch.
[3:55:42] <SMuffinMan> Oh noes are we playing the Fork Knife again?
[3:55:44] <Shardlab> @FuzzTime Or henchmen in a death cult
[3:55:48] <KeiPrime> dont forget the thugee cult in temple of doom enslaved children
[3:55:49] <%MelBrooksKA> Jesus Joel!
[3:55:52] <+glgzephyr> Indy also didn't set out *specifically to kill people*
[3:55:52] <+SoySocks> @MisterRockett Thanks for mentioning this. I forgot which game it was originally used for
[3:55:56] <%ChestMimik> And then they overdid it in 2
[3:55:56] <+MisterRockett> Cause Bioshock you have no choice in the game but to go along with the "Would you Kindly" twist.
[3:56:02] <FirewallStorm> nazis aren't people
[3:56:07] <$RealThiele> Joel becomes a shitlord quite rapidly
[3:56:13] <Devbob98> Joel was better because he knew he was a monster
[3:56:20] <%Monkeyweed21> thats the impetus behind Drakengard and NIER
[3:56:20] <tukds> then tlou2 backtracked the random enemies don't mean shit but you can't kill Abby
[3:56:22] <%BigCoffee> Hey Pat since you play games for a living, how do you manage not to get tired of the other games on your own time?
[3:56:30] <+Saggitori> phrasing
[3:56:31] <LorcaNomad> wording pat
[3:56:31] <leinadtonu> just like Rambo then
[3:56:41] <DrkJP520> Ellie followed in Joel's footsteps pretty spectacularly, I have to say
[3:56:48] <GoodnightSnek> She definitely did it
[3:56:53] <Dwarven_Gaming> when she kills she should freak out for a second
[3:56:56] <+Gespens> Dad of Boy, when Atreus STOPS listening to you on that mountain ascent
[3:56:58] <cis_eraser_420> the only thing tomb raider really fuckin nailed was the enemy barks though, they go from "lol we'll kill you lady" to "OH FUCK ITS HER"
[3:56:58] <%AzureGale> Yeah but bad controls are garbo
[3:56:58] <%ExpressNode> Oh I played that
[3:57:04] <T_Sasquatch> @tukds no you dont understand the enemies scream ranom names !, therefore its human
[3:57:04] <%Skelefellah> Automata does that to a degree, too
[3:57:05] <%DuskSymphony01> brothers?
[3:57:06] <RyuuAoi> Believe it though. Imagine double guns.
[3:57:06] <%shad8snake> god of war did it that one time with boi
[3:57:06] <+polothegreatest> they need rewrite jjoel to be a dumb coward pat
[3:57:08] <T_Sasquatch> brothers is godlike
[3:57:08] <+MisterRockett> I always talk about how the way Alloy's character is handled in Horizon is actually a SUPER good direction they could have done for Reboot Lara she's so much better.
[3:57:08] <hl98> sounds annoying
[3:57:16] <%Dr_DangerPhD> shortly after Lara's first kill freakout she brains a dude with the climbing axe as a stealth kill
[3:57:20] <%Daxalog> Or the new god of war when boy has his momment
[3:57:23] <leinadtonu> spec ops: the line did a good job too
[3:57:24] <Devbob98> Or metal gear 3 and punish you for killing
[3:57:25] <KeiPrime> but the reboot tomb raider plays really well tho
[3:57:26] <%BigCoffee> Except Horizon is kind of a bad game anyway
[3:57:26] <%ChestMimik> Atreus ignoring the button presses was a cool way to do it
[3:57:27] <DrkJP520> Brothers made me cry, omg
[3:57:29] <+logoth_> Pee gas
[3:57:30] <+Gespens> FFIX when Garnet got really moody
[3:57:31] <%shad8snake> uh oh stinky
[3:57:33] <$RealThiele> it takes two princess scene was heavy as hell
[3:57:39] <%miguelrod777> hubris
[3:57:41] <T_Sasquatch> @hl98 dude i promise you its the best gaming moment ive had in decades
[3:57:41] <KeiPrime> SMELLY STINKY BURNY
[3:57:46] <DianaTheAscian> damn
[3:57:46] <dmtjinni> F
[3:57:48] <LorcaNomad> good try
[3:57:56] <%YakumoYomi> So close!
[3:57:57] <VritraReiRei> that was pretty darn close
[3:58:00] <%shad8snake> DAMN YOU ANIME
[3:58:04] <hl98> killed by anime again?
[3:58:16] <%twistedj3ster> I haven't looked at the game in a while, the discussion is great
[3:58:17] <%ChestMimik> Anime can't keep getting away with this
[3:58:22] <Devbob98> Play as Lara now
[3:58:27] <%ChestMimik> Sincerity?
[3:58:30] <bigben01> MUSIC CUES
[3:58:33] <%MidnightBurst12> sincerity?
[3:58:34] <vilecrois> When you notice it
[3:58:34] <Dwarven_Gaming> trying to CHANGE it
[3:58:36] <%DuskSymphony01> the difference is the work you put in to properly justify it
[3:58:36] <Dwarven_Gaming> ?
[3:58:38] <leinadtonu> sincerity
[3:58:39] <$RealThiele> railroaded feeling
[3:58:42] <JeysJumbleJams> sincerity and handling
[3:58:44] <%dave323dave> cliches
[3:58:47] <cis_eraser_420> yeah, it's gotta be sincere and/or subtle
[3:58:47] <%BigCoffee> Pat are you excited about the RE anime netflix show?
[3:58:48] <ThirdPersonPhil> More tough put into it
[3:58:49] <T_Sasquatch> because its not earned its forced
[3:58:49] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> IMO it is entirely how much you personally relate to it
[3:58:50] <%TheLakinessMonster> Poor taste in when to use it as a narrative device
[3:58:52] <hairtoday> the overwatch trailers ride that line for me
[3:58:52] <DavidSanChan> when the feet are drawn just right
[3:58:53] <%YakumoYomi> Sincerity? Execution?
[3:58:55] <MuffinMastr> i think that is arguable. i think its the intention and the experience of the designers
[3:58:57] <DrkJP520> Sometimes it can be your mindset
[3:58:59] <%hrbeck_> The suddeness? Like a jumpscare of emotion?
[3:58:59] <hl98> 98 gang SeemsGood
[3:59:01] <KasiCrafter> Heartdtring tugging is about reality and IRL life lessons
[3:59:01] <fatlystackedmac> well don't give yourself away
[3:59:02] <+glgzephyr> there's no difference at all, the way you asked the question
[3:59:08] <Devbob98> That’s just the writer
[3:59:09] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> the author trying to actually say something
[3:59:11] <Calek> stop tugging at my heatstrings, fill my dark soul with liiiiight
[3:59:13] <T_Sasquatch> oh no dog died , why ? for sadness (looks at the last of us 2)
[3:59:16] <fatlystackedmac> cuz mommy's alright
[3:59:29] <syanplague> like Pat can i ask you what you think about that Haruka director in yakuza 5 called Park?
[3:59:30] <%Dr_DangerPhD> honestly? it depends on whether or not you like it
[3:59:44] <+JustToWatch> if they kill a dog its cheap. One of the very clever things that Adios did was the dog had died a while ago.
[3:59:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> it has to do with if you resonate with the character vs them trying to make you care about a character.
[3:59:50] <Devbob98> Remember when Watch dogs 1 tried to make you feel
[3:59:56] <thatlolifrompersona1> oh that was out of nowhere 100
[4:00:15] <KeiPrime> you mean you're told and not shown? like anankin and obiwan's friendship
[4:00:22] <%VoidBaronJules> big yikes
[4:00:24] <Devbob98> Sleeping dogs does that too
[4:00:27] <lloyddboy> DANNYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

[4:00:43] <LorcaNomad> it won't, it'll just make me hate you
[4:00:46] <ThirdPersonPhil> Except the Horse survived!
[4:00:46] <%MechArch> dammit araki
[4:00:47] <DianaTheAscian> "this character exist to die"
[4:00:49] <%Agami23> yeah
[4:00:50] <cbdhempwraps> that and the “dead gay love interest” gets on my damn nerves
[4:00:51] <%ExpressNode> That felt like the last guardian
[4:00:51] <JeysJumbleJams> YUUUO
[4:00:52] <T_Sasquatch> @Devbob98 to be fair the game made it obvious , you could see it coming
[4:00:53] <%BigCoffee> it is Burry the gays
[4:00:55] <JeysJumbleJams> YUUUP.
[4:00:55] <%Dakuu75> fucked
[4:00:56] <RyuuAoi> Okay play Apex next
[4:00:56] <%hrbeck_> the tragic lesbians
[4:00:57] <Calek> @Dakuu75 it's a trope
[4:00:57] <DavidSanChan> a 50 hour epic where you play as a Goomba only to get stomped by mario in 1-1 at the end
[4:01:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Killing the cat in romance anime.
[4:01:01] <+MisterRockett> Being gay is SUFFERING
[4:01:04] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Or even both
[4:01:10] <FirewallStorm> thats fucked
[4:01:15] <leinadtonu> can't have too many gays
[4:01:16] <$RealThiele> damnit permutter
[4:01:18] <KeiPrime> fridging comes from Green Lantern, when fuckin MAjor Force kills Kyle Rayner's girlfriend and stuffs her in the fridge for cheap heat
[4:01:21] <Devbob98> The gay must suffer is so annoying
[4:01:22] <%YakumoYomi> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[4:01:22] <%weissguard> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink
[4:01:23] <%ChestMimik> IT SUCKS
[4:01:24] <%valriot> TLOU2 is SO FUCKING BAD with LGBT rep
[4:01:24] <RyuuAoi> Yuri on Ice?
[4:01:27] <+preppyposs> IT WAS *BAD*
[4:01:28] <+london_flexing> Trope named after Green Lantern comic plotline, guys chill out
[4:01:29] <DianaTheAscian> oh that happens?
[4:01:32] <%Puhff> gay people don't get happy endings
[4:01:32] <JeysJumbleJams> @BigCoffee it actually is bury your gays, the 'your' is referring to the showrunners
[4:01:36] <nevan_44> SO BAD
[4:01:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> EMLO
[4:01:36] <dragoon001914> The new Voltron show was fucking garbage
[4:01:37] <LorcaNomad> also trans representation in media is also uber fucked
[4:01:38] <+MordoPrime> the gay bait tho
[4:01:38] <%Agami23> man, i still cant believe walking dead changed things to specifically kill off the gay characters
[4:01:38] <leinadtonu> what if they reproduce? what then?
[4:01:40] <%ChestMimik> DID IT TWICE
[4:01:44] <%shad8snake> the baby
[4:01:44] <+tempestzephyr> walking dead game S2 totaly did that
[4:01:46] <DianaTheAscian> Never touching that I guess
[4:01:46] <hl98> gay characters make me uncomfortable
[4:01:47] <Calek> Voltron only lasted two seasons, you can't change my mind
[4:01:49] <+Gespens> TWO TIMES
[4:01:53] <+MisterRockett> It's the only character I know of who even died.
[4:01:56] <%BigCoffee> @JeysJumbleJams tyty
[4:01:57] <+Stormzcales_Lair> gen:lock starts a black guy... who dies in first episode
[4:01:58] <T_Sasquatch> im almost under the impression that shera and voltron are just about being gay LUL
[4:01:59] <Jaysky> The fanbase brought it to life Pat, it was never meant to happen
[4:01:59] <%valriot> TLOU2 acts as those LGBT people are constantly suffering due to bigots, when thats like, a minor footnote in their life
[4:02:00] <%baka_sugoi> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[4:02:00] <thatlolifrompersona1> That dude was blind
[4:02:03] <+JobbedBone> the mainstream always turns to martyrdom as a cheap ploy for their white savior shit
[4:02:03] <Saltmeisterr> @hl98 to bad lol
[4:02:04] <%VoidBaronJules> new shera had problems but the do the reverse
[4:02:09] <Onatamana> Volton's animators and junk apparently super queerbaited the fandom on social media.
[4:02:11] <%Agami23> i heard that the characters in voltron that were gay got tortured WAY more than anyone else as well
[4:02:15] <%Monkeyweed21> props to IBO for letting gay and poly characters get a happy ending
[4:02:15] <+preppyposs> @PatStaresAt it was the same gay couple and it happened twice
[4:02:16] <FirewallStorm> etf
[4:02:17] <%VoidBaronJules> they cap it with a gay kisss
[4:02:19] <+tempestzephyr> queer baiting gets attention
[4:02:19] <FirewallStorm> wtf
[4:02:24] <+MordoPrime> @hl98 only when literally thats their only identity
[4:02:28] <LorcaNomad> BABY
[4:02:29] <its_kleine> elmo baby
[4:02:30] <T_Sasquatch> bigot sandwich YUM
[4:02:31] <Devbob98> Can we please have a gay character that just has a great life and succeeds in love
[4:02:32] <Dwarven_Gaming> thought he was dead
[4:02:35] <%ChestMimik> No, two different couples!
[4:02:35] <%legend_of_nolan> ELMO
[4:02:37] <RyuuAoi> Blacula. Watch it
[4:02:37] <Dwarven_Gaming> then ACTUALLY dead
[4:02:39] <vilecrois> But people die when they are killed»
[4:02:39] <+MisterRockett> One got brought back to life and then the other died?
[4:02:40] <%BigCoffee> who was the queer/gay couple on voltron? was it the twink boy that was actually a girl?
[4:02:42] <+preppyposs> @PatStaresAt one came back from the dead and then we found out his boyfriend died in a timeskip
[4:02:43] <JeysJumbleJams> they added a love interest that showed up in one scene, never expressed any love to each other, and then died off screen
[4:02:49] <BentArcher> The lead in the cartoon is gay and he doesn't die
[4:02:51] <%TheLakinessMonster> These pieces of media try to sell internationally, some places aren't ok.
[4:02:54] <%DoktorZee> psaPorgmo
[4:02:56] <+walt_chocolate> EMOTIONS MAKE U WEAK!!🤧
[4:02:58] <%MidnightBurst12> that sounds like a slur
[4:03:02] <+kewlmyc> WOOF
[4:03:04] <+MisterRockett> OH NO
[4:03:05] <DrkJP520> hah wow
[4:03:06] <T_Sasquatch> LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
[4:03:06] <Qsmash_> jeez...
[4:03:07] <hl98> logic LUL
[4:03:08] <%UvBenServed> NotLikeThis
[4:03:08] <LorcaNomad> hmmmm
[4:03:09] <T_Sasquatch> HHAHAHAHAH
[4:03:10] <%MidnightBurst12> oof
[4:03:10] <Mattais88> no racism, no gays
[4:03:11] <cis_eraser_420> lmao
[4:03:11] <Saltmeisterr> yikes
[4:03:11] <nevan_44> WOW
[4:03:13] <%Mathochism> I'd just like it if we'd get to the point where a gay couple just exists and it has no bearing on the story at all. It'd resemble my actual existence, y'know?
[4:03:15] <%Puhff> Or you get shit like the nonbinary trans jedi who are just bald gray people or that superhero literally named Snowflake
[4:03:18] <%saladin1911> That sounds hilarious. What?! LUL LUL
[4:03:22] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Still always laughing at how nuclear tumblr was at the end of Supernatural
[4:03:25] <Devbob98> Gravity falls did have a gay couple that was happy
[4:03:28] <RyuuAoi> Oof
[4:03:30] <T_Sasquatch> You see the future the gay gene has been removed
[4:03:30] <+CaptainPyron> I feel like SheRa is a good example of representation.
[4:03:33] <%BubbaRands> If anything there'd be less straight people LUL
[4:03:34] <+kewlmyc> A BLACK
[4:03:34] <%Cozy90> A BLACK
[4:03:36] <LorcaNomad> monkaS
[4:03:39] <KeiPrime> a black
[4:03:41] <%octavian_wolf> octavian_wolf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! one year with uncle Pat, not bad
[4:03:44] <nevan_44> OH NOOOO
[4:03:49] <Calek> he's a little confused but the spirit is there
[4:03:51] <%UvBenServed> One WHOLE black
[4:03:51] <%Puhff> Rodenberry originally wanted Deana Troi to be a 3 breasted hermaphrodite.
[4:03:52] <leinadtonu> the times were fucked
[4:03:52] <%ChestMimik> We've got an n word on the bridge
[4:03:52] <%AzureGale> Damn, son
[4:03:54] <Devbob98> It’s okay, it’s the future
[4:03:56] <ZE_Count> it was the 60s
[4:03:57] <KeiPrime> as was the style at the time
[4:03:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Iron Blooded Orphans is shocking for having gay and poly characters and letting several of them live happily ever after
[4:04:04] <+preppyposs> raven just guzzling juice is so funny
[4:04:10] <RyuuAoi> Yes, Gene
[4:04:10] <Devbob98> Twilight zone does it better
[4:04:11] <+MakishimaWolf> It was the early 1960's
[4:04:16] <%BubbaRands> a ONE black
[4:04:16] <+MordoPrime> and still, it was the wokest show on tv
[4:04:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> 1966
[4:04:17] <%BigCoffee> @Monkeyweed21 that show is still depression fuel
[4:04:21] <ZE_Count> 66 to 67
[4:04:26] <RyuuAoi> #
[4:04:29] <+JobbedBone> thats what happens when your society has NO CONCEPT OF MONEY
[4:04:31] <JeysJumbleJams> gpmFear
[4:04:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> TOS was 1966 to 69
[4:04:37] <ZE_Count> I remember because MLK talked about star trek
[4:04:39] <+rocketaku> why would you want to have sex with another man when you have super crazy alien sex
[4:04:41] <RyuuAoi> I mean it was still bad, Pat
[4:04:41] <T_Sasquatch> progressiveness is in steps
[4:04:42] <fatlystackedmac> GAY PEOPLE IN SPACE????
[4:04:44] <nevan_44> why tho?
[4:04:48] <%Mathochism> Dax.
[4:04:52] <Lancaster_H> so wait, is the thought that they would die out??
[4:04:53] <RyuuAoi> The times...
[4:04:55] <KeiPrime> gene died after season 1 of tng man
[4:04:57] <leinadtonu> Do the gayness killed him?
[4:04:58] <%Fooguwu> "We 'fixed' gay people in the future, but also genetic modification to remove birth defects is WRONG"
[4:05:09] <%ChestMimik> Wait I've never watched the original series, are Kirk and Spok not a couple?
[4:05:16] <%TheLakinessMonster> Can't expect old era people to be 100% on everything.
[4:05:18] <dragoon001914> Didn't Gene die before DS9 was a thing?
[4:05:20] <%Puhff> julien is bi as fuck too
[4:05:21] <Mattais88> Gou'ld in SG1
[4:05:23] <%UvBenServed> Nice
[4:05:32] <+twin_Egoist> Gene was already dead, dude
[4:05:33] <%Cozy90> Man Gul Dukat was such a cool character until the end.
[4:05:38] <KeiPrime> about 5 or 6 years before ds9 yeah
[4:05:38] <cis_eraser_420> moral: gays>old assholes
[4:05:39] <SmolBluGhost> lmao
[4:05:39] <hl98> stop talking about start wars shit
[4:05:43] <%toastybites> i thought pat was talking about Animorphs for a moment
[4:05:44] <Devbob98> Gene’s ghost did it
[4:05:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Roddenberry died in 89
[4:05:49] <+senfood> Tailor/Badass Spy
[4:05:50] <%Mathochism> God bless Garak. Best Trek character ever.
[4:05:55] <+JobbedBone> is he still talking about space balls?
[4:06:00] <%Puhff> friendship Kappa
[4:06:03] <RyuuAoi> I gotta get in!
[4:06:05] <%BigCoffee> wait wh's gay?!
[4:06:06] <KeiPrime> yeah he barely got s1 of tng off the ground
[4:06:09] <%Cozy90> Garak was an awesome character
[4:06:20] <leinadtonu> they were gay behind his back
[4:06:20] <Devbob98> Remember when Poe and Finn weren’t allowed to be gay
[4:06:27] <Broken_Sonex> Just this one gay thing
[4:06:28] <FuzzTime> I loved Garak, him and Dax were my favourite characters
[4:06:30] <hairtoday> Garak got a novel written by the actor, it's awesome
[4:06:35] <EuropanLamprey> That first meeting has so much subtext its nuts
[4:06:35] <%valriot> MAAAAN LUL
[4:06:37] <Shardlab> And everyone was down
[4:06:38] <%shad8snake> cuz China
[4:06:42] <+senfood> They were SO on board.
[4:06:43] <Shardlab> The actors were down
[4:06:50] <$RealThiele> Finn got fucked so badly
[4:06:52] <AEnemyStandUser> remember when they burn John boyega so hard that he hate Star Wars now
[4:06:54] <%BubbaRands> Wasted opportunity there
[4:06:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> No. John Boyega did not want that. He wanted Rey
[4:06:55] <Shardlab> The audience were down
[4:06:57] <+JustToWatch> Poe and Finn should have absolutely been gay
[4:06:57] <Devbob98> Their chemistry
[4:06:59] <nevan_44> FeelsBadMan
[4:07:01] <%Mathochism> Oscar Isaac.
[4:07:01] <%BigCoffee> Arent the 2 actors hetero too? But they where so down to be a cool gay character
[4:07:03] <%TheLakinessMonster> @Devbob98 Finn wasn't allowed to be on the poster too much
[4:07:03] <Mattais88> Issac
[4:07:04] <%Agami23> remember when finn wasent allowed to be important?
[4:07:04] <%Cozy90> i loved all the interactions with gul dukat and kira
[4:07:06] <dragoon001914> lmao
[4:07:09] <hl98> china hates gays too?
[4:07:11] <%ChestMimik> Get PAID to make out, too
[4:07:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Oscar Issac wanted that.
[4:07:14] <Devbob98> They made sure to show you they weren’t gay too lol
[4:07:15] <Broken_Sonex> FNN SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE HERO
[4:07:15] <%jaybombdotcom> I mean Im a huge progressive but Furries get out LOL
[4:07:15] <Shardlab> Everyone was down with it, but then they went full on cowardly
[4:07:18] <$RealThiele> oh man that wouldve been amazing
[4:07:22] <DrkJP520> It's OK though, cuz we got some interracial love instead. Nothing unchristian about that
[4:07:26] <RyuuAoi> They got it in, Pat KappaClaus
[4:07:28] <%hrbeck_> let the space bois kiss
[4:07:29] <Virokwet> whyd he keep jumping

[4:07:30] <DianaTheAscian> pika boo
[4:07:32] <$RealThiele> furry barge can never leave
[4:07:34] <+Onionchamp> literal skeet shooting
[4:07:39] <+MordoPrime> but...oh yeah, disney still wanted china money
[4:07:49] <%UvBenServed> No gay in Star Wars, only incest
[4:07:51] <%ElkRiverDog> Sooo, Trekkers were basically prepared to walk their kids through divorcing JK from their fandom?
[4:08:04] <Devbob98> Finn got done so dirty in every way
[4:08:07] <ammobasket> Duck Hunt
[4:08:14] <$RealThiele> rick berman can fuck off
[4:08:21] <%ChestMimik> Bully the children!
[4:08:27] <Broken_Sonex> @Devbob98 He should've been the hero
[4:08:30] <Explodincatz> jesus
[4:08:33] <RyuuAoi> @uvbenserved Right

[4:08:36] <Ravioli_Ronin> What is it with Ricks?
[4:08:38] <+polothegreatest> i just wanted atrooper becoming a cool jedi
[4:08:39] <RyuuAoi> Gross
[4:08:48] <%Cozy90> jake sisko kinda sucked though
[4:08:51] <SpaceManHotepIV> LUL
[4:09:02] <mrlastchance1> remember that one episode when riker dated that alien that wanted to be a gender?
[4:09:03] <%Puhff> even the women
[4:09:08] <Devbob98> He be right though
[4:09:16] <%Monkeyweed21> hey Naughty Dog
[4:09:21] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[4:09:23] <%shad8snake> thats why diversity important in a team
[4:09:24] <oceanmatt> u gonna use those shields pat?
[4:09:25] <%Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt How goes the children beating
[4:09:27] <KeiPrime> remember that episode where dr crusher fucked that ghost
[4:09:30] <leinadtonu> in and out
[4:09:30] <Shardlab> It does
[4:09:33] <Shardlab> So much
[4:09:35] <%Agami23> last of us
[4:09:35] <nevan_44> OOF LUL
[4:09:36] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man TLOU2 does that really bad
[4:09:37] <Calek> write them like they're people bam done
[4:09:40] <hl98> men can't write women
[4:09:43] <Devbob98> Tolkien was pretty honest about not knowing how to wrote women
[4:09:47] <%ChestMimik> Probably better than accidentally writing a racism
[4:09:52] <+Kyma1020> And that’s when you hire sensitivity consultants
[4:09:59] <Broken_Sonex> @hl98 And women can't write men
[4:10:04] <DavidSanChan> licks sweat off eye, mm girl
[4:10:05] <DrkJP520> You haven't?!?!
[4:10:08] <RyuuAoi> Ask Uhura?
[4:10:11] <+MackFighters> wait, Pat isn't a lesbian?
[4:10:12] <+Quack_of_Dawn> You should really try it sometime, Pat
[4:10:16] <+Shubreaker> "i really want to kiss you rn"
[4:10:17] <Devbob98> Ellie was such a bitch to her girlfriend, like chill
[4:10:19] <%neroforte177> the best friend from invincible just seems like a dude who happens to be gay
[4:10:19] <%walternatorz> the apocalypse redefined lesbianism, duh
[4:10:21] <leinadtonu> it's hard for us men to be in lesbian relationships
[4:10:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Theres no Black love ever so you all can cry me a river
[4:10:27] <%Monkeyweed21> there are multiple cases of minority men getting shot and killed and never mentioned again in that game @PatStaresAt
[4:10:30] <hl98> he just looks like a lesbian
[4:10:39] <%Gogogolem> Sometimes nothing is better.
[4:10:45] <%Puhff> i am also not a lesbian, but i imagine they have a lot in common with literally any other relationship between two people that involves sex
[4:10:47] <Jrocy247> But at the same time, Ellie Girlfriend, might as well not existed anywhere in the story
[4:10:48] <%TheLakinessMonster> Imagine if Amy Henig wasn't pushed out of Naughty Dog.
[4:10:48] <+senfood> With representation, it's about taking what you can get with the hope that it'll get better over time.
[4:10:48] <KasiCrafter> Sometimes you'd rather have nothing
[4:10:53] <+rocketaku> There's nothing better about a lesbian romance than just smoking a tonne of weed
[4:10:57] <+Stormzcales_Lair> @TurtlesAndTentacles hell not even black character customization let alone love.
[4:10:59] <%Lion_kun> Druckmann tried for the wrong reasons
[4:11:06] <dragoon001914> Hennig took a story about time traveling vampires and made it good.
[4:11:08] <ytbmorales> Oh my god, when REDACTED gets shot in the face and never mentioned again? @Monkeyweed21 That was TERRIBLE
[4:11:11] <Shardlab> @senfood Every damned day
[4:11:17] <+YeetOfTheMoment> @hl98 can you stop being homophobic please
[4:11:19] <%Lion_kun> Druckmann is a hack who fails upwards
[4:11:22] <Devbob98> She deserved better
[4:11:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @ytbmorales it literally happens 3 times
[4:11:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Stormzcales_Lair EXACTLY. Right on the head
[4:11:45] <Devbob98> Her dialogue was so good
[4:11:48] <+senfood> @Shardlab Truth.
[4:11:49] <$Monkeyweed21> yea I loved Nosgoth
[4:11:58] <hl98> @yeetofthemoment, didn't mean for that to be homophobic NotLikeThis
[4:12:02] <%jaybombdotcom> How much do i have to donate to get pat to pay all the kain games
[4:12:03] <pajamarammaslamma> Is Legacy of Kain that Nosgoth spinoff?
[4:12:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Nosgoth was great back in the day
[4:12:14] <%Agami23> does blood omen hold up?
[4:12:16] <Lancaster_H> holy shit i forgot about Nosgoth

[4:24:53] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cis_eraser_420 I feel that's not the case for Minecraft since I still feel that it's been going strong for a long time
[4:25:08] <%TheLakinessMonster> @cis_eraser_420 Of course, that's because literal children are playing.
[4:25:16] <elicoy> @saladin1911 LUL hell yeah or best DOOG
