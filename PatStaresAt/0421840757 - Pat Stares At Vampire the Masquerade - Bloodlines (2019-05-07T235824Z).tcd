[0:06:56] <%0dokuro> Ya
[0:06:58] <%Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid500 So glad that you and Woolie are at the point i'm at with GoT; i've been seeing the shit snowball rolling as far back as three years ago; atm all i want from GoT is for ether you or Plague to go through it so i get to hear you complain about it; hope you enjoyed my "Marvels of German Engineering" meme attempt. PS do you think female vampires drink their own period blood?
[0:07:00] <%Davenofport> be careful he might assault you at a hotel then do a shitty magic trick

Unlike those small birds who start chirping outside my window at 3am. Pat, radiation can be a particle, wave, or both (looking at that asshole; light) because it's a spectrum. Some of them are particles, others are waves. By this metric, even sound is technically radiation!

You know you can just equip the pickaxe and just melee the vein to get the stuff right? Just dual wield that shit and shred those minerals like unprotected chickens. Question 2: You're playing as elmo, but you already exist in the game as a fully voiced character mod, so why not install that? Plus with your resources, connections, and fans, I'm sure someone can squeeze out a paige mod in time too, or at l

[0:15:59] <%Niney_Who> but 2 was da best oneee
[0:16:01] <%Fadedblank247> 3 and 4 are great but very sameish
[0:16:05] <PortableBoredom> Saints Row 2 is still the best Saints Row game ever made. I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.

[0:16:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> bleedpurple500 bonus50 I'm sure someone can squeeze out a paige mod in time too, or at least for next week, so you can all adventure together! Throw in some marriage mod, and taunt paige with the thing you'll apparently never do irl! (Optional: play as Paige, marry your NPC follower, then use that one mod that adds khajiht orphans, so you can adopt elmo as your son.) That and forgotten city is a cool quest mod. It's decently lore friendly, fully voiced, and got a shit ton of awards.
[0:16:39] <nevertrustcheez> I liked 3 the most, personally
[0:16:42] <BunnyEmperor> Pat's ASMR red bull lip smackin

[0:16:44] <%AncelDeLambert> 2 is just another GTA knockoff

[0:20:56] <%0dokuro> You don't become a cube, the cube becomes you.
[0:20:58] <xeros720> enter the cube, then naturally expand until you fill its geometry
[0:20:59] <%CJett92> MrDestructoid become as cube MrDestructoid become as cube MrDestructoid
[0:21:00] <+Spec7re> @Eepravenous I was just about to say
[0:21:02] <%TenderBabyBacon> Whenever i think about vampire noises, my mind instantly goes to HoM&M 3
[0:21:07] <%crimsonharvest> yeah the 'deluge' in antedeluvian is the flood from Genesis

[0:21:32] <%spiritofmojave> Hey it's finally succ-time, how are y'all
[0:21:35] <$SGrim> Japanese Iron was relatively low quality, but slag is mineral waste, Different things.
[0:21:36] <%LymanAl> I am become cube, defender of the polyverse
[0:21:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's poor-quality iron, but it isn't the same thing as slag
[0:21:39] <+drakthebest> Modern katanas are carbon steel, don't know about old ones

[0:21:52] <%AbnormalVoid> 11 hours is too much sleep lol
[0:21:56] <+drakthebest> Carbon steel is actually extremely high quality
[0:21:56] <%skizzuto> The secret to not being sleepy is to have a consistent sleep schedule
[0:21:58] <+cvp5127> oh boi
[0:21:58] <%Svanyr> Shaaaaaaaaaaaft
[0:22:01] <%CJett92> Monogatari is really cool but fuckkin wierd

[0:22:07] <+Zereaux> NOT RELATED AT ALL
[0:22:07] <IndoorSitup> TOOTHBRUSH
[0:22:09] <%Nikopol1717> Good shit
[0:22:11] <starotter70> katanagatari is pretty neat
[0:22:11] <%crimsonharvest> That's not a series you should discuss in polite company its uh... quite something
[0:22:13] <Midnight188> not related but okay
[0:22:13] <%Faustgesicht> it'... ok
[0:22:14] <Patzzki217> ore monogatari da bes
[0:22:16] <%spiritofmojave> Monogatari is a fucking trip, and actually good
[0:22:16] <yourliteraldog> I'd rather be wizard but become tv magician al la chris angel. That way I can get around paradoxes right quick.
[0:22:16] <NotHereToStream> the most pretentious shit and i love it
[0:22:21] <+drakthebest> Monogatari is a completely different series, but also, look up "Toothbrush scene monogatari"
[0:22:22] <%Kavtech> The Monogatari series is pretty good.
[0:22:24] <%Typhaeon> Pat solved Timecube by embodying it
[0:22:25] <simulationbard> That's such a weird show and I love it
[0:22:26] <Psyramics> Ore Monogatari has absolutely nothing to do with Bakemonogatori and its sequels
[0:22:33] <ithirstforfreddurst> fuck randy lol
[0:22:35] <+SolverCODO> It IS good though
[0:22:35] <aimlesshealer> Time is convoluted in the cube. Also, time IS the cube.
[0:22:36] <%CJett92> Pat's already said he's seen the toothbrush scene
[0:22:39] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Zereaux) (warning)
[0:22:41] <Eepravenous> Tales is the only good borderlands game, and the best telltale game
[0:22:42] <IndoorSitup> t o o t h b r u s h
[0:22:46] <+TeraMercier> Yeah, me neither, until it had me in stitches in the first lp episode
[0:22:50] <raxes8> @angriestpat Yea. All the world warriors get character sheets. E Honda can have dynamite thrown at him and maybe take damage from it.
[0:22:51] <%0dokuro> T o o t h b r u s h
[0:22:53] <+PenmanLupine> Monogatari just means "Story" or "Tale" so a bunch of different shows have Monogatari in their name.
[0:22:56] <$castcode> what
[0:22:56] <%Piemen99> @Moobot Fuck you moobot
[0:22:57] <+BisoromiBear> I cast Hadoken at 5th level

[0:23:12] <lionmanguy> Do....they mean burn legend?
[0:23:16] <yourliteraldog> In one your an actual mummy

[0:32:08] <%crimsonharvest> @Kavtech most of the 80s and 90s rpgs have that kind of twist at the end, i'd recommend Shin Megami Tensei 3 on the ps2.
[0:32:08] <$cureneckbeard> Pat can't discard a card because WHAT IF I NEED IT LATER THOUGH

[1:12:33] <%manwithboxonhead> There could be another sarcophagus of an ancient Mesopotamian King
[1:12:34] <%LymanAl> What is this dark carnival?
[1:12:35] <Eepravenous> use the Icarus Drop or whatever
[1:12:36] <Atzros> and they lived lmao
[1:12:37] <washington1806> what if the sarcophagus is just full of copies of Shrek the Third
[1:12:38] <voyagerwitch> do the deus ex thing where you turn your kinetic energy into- that also works
[1:12:42] <+Spec7re> Drinky time
[1:12:45] <切捨御免> that didn't do a lot of damage at all
[1:12:46] <$Mighty_observer> no fal ldamage?
[1:12:49] <+ChrisAlgoo> succ
[1:12:50] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh my god he ate him
[1:12:50] <%Laecerelius> Man these guys are pretty beefy
[1:12:52] <ooblag> Don't forget your BLUD shield
[1:12:54] <Ion_Laser> The SUCC
[1:12:56] <omen_setter> do they gotta put the barrel back every time they come here
[1:12:57] <Atzros> Fall damage is a thing, but it's really low
[1:13:00] <washington1806> vampies have hollow bones, like birds
[1:13:02] <natebud> 13 damage
[1:13:02] <DracaenaLeaf> nope
[1:13:05] <pmtriox> were blown clear
[1:13:05] <washington1806> so they don't get fall damage
[1:13:07] <DracaenaLeaf> right?
[1:13:08] <Shotred> I remember this mission get ready to die a lot from the boss
[1:13:10] <twistedj3ster> Why are there tuna cans down here
[1:13:12] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Maybe Shaggy is in the sarcophagus
[1:13:14] <%CaptainTubaki> @Mighty_observer he landed on that tall box think that ate the damage
[1:13:15] <+alphonseisbest> the great pat stopable
[1:13:21] <mojokingizakku> gunmin are resistant to explosive damage
[1:13:23] <+dukenux> What good is being a vamire if a fall can kill you?
[1:13:24] <Youwereeatenbyalid> This music reminds me of the Grimme Troup
[1:13:31] <Combat_Data> Pat, has anyone told you that weapons on do good damage when you have met their skill requirements?
[1:13:32] <CrabSlacks> vampires are dead so of course there isn't fall damage
[1:13:34] <切捨御免> this looks a lot like the nossie neet caves
[1:13:38] <$Mighty_observer> @DK_Rance Dev excuses
[1:13:43] <Youwereeatenbyalid> And DOOM.
[1:13:43] <xeros720> the new Doom did too
[1:13:44] <+Manjove> aren't human bones technically hollow too
[1:13:44] <+dukenux> DEAD ON!
[1:13:46] <Eepravenous> kinda DOOMish as well
[1:13:49] <Flare3500> Kingdom Hearts too
[1:13:52] <DracaenaLeaf> Who's peeing
[1:13:52] <$Mighty_observer> must peeeeeeeee
[1:13:53] <%wolfofsound> It's like that in the real world if you're brave enough
[1:13:56] <starotter70> Hey man
[1:13:58] <%VioletHeart> Bloodborne also, kinda? And any game where enemies drop health packs.
[1:13:59] <$PaleBloodInk> They branded him.

[1:14:07] <Mnightshyamallama> so enemies are consumables?
[1:14:08] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh shit. It IS this dude
[1:14:08] <+dukenux> What's thehaps, BRUH
[1:14:14] <+Fynale> he has fangs
[1:14:14] <+dukenux> oh right, this guy
[1:14:15] <tinypouf> they got the boy oh no
[1:14:15] <%Elemntion> Elemntion subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:14:17] <%spiritofmojave> Gotta take his Faceoff
[1:14:19] <%manwithboxonhead> Toreador guy
[1:14:20] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's fine. Just get a bigger tattoo.
[1:14:22] <yourliteraldog> Kill 2 heal is great mechanic in games
[1:14:22] <$Mighty_observer> the inquisition!!!!!!!!!!
[1:14:23] <natebud> What a pleasant surprise
[1:14:24] <SnaKemuho> no more acting for the boy
[1:14:25] <%Frost_Quill> Pat if this game followed the lore more closely this coming boss would FUCK you up no question. You shouldn't even be able to touch them.
[1:14:27] <omen_setter> you look like shit
[1:14:29] <Doodle_Taco> This wounds will not heal
[1:14:32] <RetributionP> "You fucked up my face"
[1:14:39] <ravenconspiracy> He could join a metal band with that face
[1:14:41] <yourliteraldog> 3
[1:14:42] <Matufreak> Did you know, aggravated damage in the tabletop game takes 5 blood points and a day to heal ONE damage?
[1:14:43] <Youwereeatenbyalid> 3
[1:14:44] <%wolfofsound> 3
[1:14:44] <starotter70> Well that plan didn't work...
[1:14:44] <JayEarly> seems like every mid-2000s shooter had to have a Deagle as the ULTIMATE WEAPON
[1:14:47] <DracaenaLeaf> you don't get anything for this
[1:14:52] <%mh9s> what happened to your FAAAAACE
[1:14:57] <Mushball> its the CS effect
[1:14:58] <fusedforms> Deagle is inferior to Anaconda tho
[1:15:00] <%augusm> @AngriestPat in regards to less fall damage than expected Vamps are super resistant to bashing damage because they are just big ol' bags of blood so when you hit them they just kind of jiggle, so it translates into fall damage as well
[1:15:00] <starotter70> Rude
[1:15:05] <切捨御免> 'don't go anywhere' ahahahaha
[1:15:09] <ScreamingMeat> BLOOD BUFF
[1:15:15] <Wonky_Chicken_Room> they don't make games with this much SOUL anymore :(
[1:15:17] <SnaKemuho> humanity earned for feeding a vampire 🤔
[1:15:17] <natebud> Good thing he save the item
[1:15:20] <IndoorSitup> Pat you should shoot their motherfucking heads off with your own head and then you should shoot your own head off with your headshot shoot.
[1:15:20] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Lock picking 10 AKA "Find the key fucker"
[1:15:21] <Eepravenous> he couldnt unlock a 9, this one is 10
[1:15:21] <$Mighty_observer> shoot the lock
[1:15:22] <Meekest> You tried
[1:15:22] <Atzros> He can't do 9 with Blood Buff, so I doubt he could do 10
[1:15:22] <washington1806> what do you think it's like to be full of blood
[1:15:23] <Tampaoster> jump in the shit water
[1:15:24] <ooblag> Blood Buff only gets him to like 8
[1:15:24] <RupanSen> blood buff isn't enough
[1:15:26] <切捨御免> worth a SHOT, eh?
[1:15:27] <%Laecerelius> He can't pick it even with blood buff on
[1:15:29] <+Diabetic> so what generation is your player?
[1:15:29] <Weeabooninja> Worth "A shot" eh?
[1:15:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Don't guns solve everything? Movies lied to me?
[1:15:32] <shamblerhero> worth a shot LUL
[1:15:33] <+ShadowArcangel> worth a shot eh? haha
[1:15:36] <%spiritofmojave> Eyyy @切捨御免
[1:15:36] <voyagerwitch> @washington1806 wish i knew
[1:15:36] <Mushball> points for thinking outside the box
[1:15:40] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ...
[1:15:40] <washington1806> guns only salve problems that matter
[1:15:40] <%TheKekromancer> after a certain distance in vampire fall damage turns from bashing to aggrivated tho
[1:15:42] <$PaleBloodInk> @Diabetic 8th gen, I think.
[1:15:43] <count_bob> @Diabetic 8th
[1:15:45] <pmtriox> "they enjoyed it" is the part I don't get, why the hell wouldn't they?
[1:15:47] <SunshineCaboose> Those scars shouldn't last. Only sunlight scars and special Tremere tattoos last forever on a vampire
[1:15:47] <%RadicalPirate> @Diabetic 8th
[1:15:48] <$Mighty_observer> poop vampire
[1:15:48] <+Diabetic> ah ok
[1:15:50] <%wolfofsound> @Mushball you mean outside the cube? Kappa
[1:15:50] <+alphonseisbest> @diabetic 7 or 8
[1:15:51] <%OldOnyx> Fan Fact: some vampire hunters in this setting alter their blood so that drinking from them will burn a vampire from the inside
[1:15:52] <%Frost_Quill> @Diabetic Like 8th or 7th based on the blood pool.

[1:16:32] <Dr_Mooose> that voice acting
[1:16:34] <%Luna_Ashford> Is anyone else getting video freezes?
[1:16:34] <%MightyMaxT> This game has changed me forever. It proved to me that video games didn't have to be about killing people. They could evoke complex themes and subtle emotions, resonate differently with different people
[1:16:42] <superd4v3> GREAT ACTING THERE!
[1:16:46] <theshillman> speaking of janky source engine, it would be fun to get pat to play E.Y.E divine cybermancy some time

[1:17:04] <LtSergei> you aren't really taking advantage of your blood pool pat
[1:17:07] <washington1806> do you think italians get a native danage to vampires who try to give them the suck
[1:17:10] <Kirbachev> @MightyMaxT And just as you say that Pat charges in with a Deagle blazing. Perfect timing LUL
[1:17:15] <Atzros> no but he might NEED that blood later!
[1:17:17] <+dukenux> I can't believe that until David Cage all videogames were about killling
[1:17:23] <Matufreak> falling in the tabletop converts from bashing damage to lethal at 100 feet, to a maximum of 10 dice of damage
[1:17:24] <+dukenux> what a great man
[1:17:35] <washington1806> what if you had a pool filled with blood
[1:17:37] <+Spec7re> We now have EMOTIONS
[1:17:41] <washington1806> whos blood?
[1:17:44] <切捨御免> crazy talk ACTIVATE
[1:17:45] <washington1806> does it matter?
[1:17:47] <$Mighty_observer> @SnaKemuho i still hear the fighting music in my sleep
[1:17:50] <%TheKekromancer> you can chuck blood salvos and fire gun at same time
[1:17:53] <aimlesshealer> If you wear full plate armor, vampires can't bite you
[1:17:55] <%spiritofmojave> Games like Omikron aren't about killing, it's about soul-succing Kappa
[1:18:10] <Eepravenous> If these guys are catholic, are there vamp hunters from all the weird shitty offshoot Christian churches?
[1:18:13] <SnaKemuho> I can't believe until killing that guy to move a rock in Omikron videogames were all about killing

[1:23:32] <sindegra> pat you gotta use blood salvo against bosses.
[1:23:33] <+Shonen_hero> It's not god it's his faith in god, but yes in World of Darkness God is also real
[1:23:33] <Youwereeatenbyalid> OH SHIT
[1:23:33] <%manwithboxonhead> Jesus Christ our first j Idol
[1:23:34] <BigCoffee> True faith in any god works, but a fraction of a fraction of a percentage has actual true faith
[1:23:34] <silver__viii> He really isn't putting up much of a fight now is he
[1:23:36] <%augusm> There's supposed to be a blinding flash of light every time he does that teleport but it looks like it fucked up

[1:23:41] <+Shonen_hero> and depending on canon also a machine?
[1:23:42] <%stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Yes, but only if you have TRUE FAITH. Around 90% of people don't have TRUE FAITH anymore.

[1:33:07] <%Shikari21> OPEN THAT SHITC
[1:33:08] <Atzros> They got their asses ate
[1:33:08] <LtSergei> they got killed by the third generation
[1:33:09] <+ShadowArcangel> Not anymore
[1:33:09] <+CaptainJax> 2nds are all dead, 3rds are documented
[1:33:10] <jonathandemel> All killed by 3rd
[1:33:10] <+Diabetic> all were killed by the 3rd
[1:33:10] <@Pandora_Prime> Anything lower than 6 is stupidly powerful
[1:33:10] <%spiritofmojave> Because they were consumed
[1:33:11] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> 2nd generation got killed by the 3rd
[1:33:11] <ooblag> 3rd gen killed the 2nd gen
[1:33:11] <deviljhojho94> Not alive at least....
[1:33:11] <%SolidusRex> The third generation killed all their sires
[1:33:12] <%castcode> super dead
[1:33:12] <count_bob> All dead.
[1:33:12] <Mr_Rakjo> @AngriestPat 2nd gen got killed and eaten
[1:33:13] <RupanSen> 3rd gens killed them all
[1:33:14] <%Frost_Quill> They got killed by third.
[1:33:14] <Etherealizer> They got nom'd on
[1:33:15] <natebud> @washington1806 dude... cmon
[1:33:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nope
[1:33:16] <+FortunesBlack> 3rd gen ate them
[1:33:16] <%TheKekromancer> thats why 3rd is ebil
[1:33:17] <%augusm> 3rd Gen killed all the 2nd Gen, its why Caine cursed them
[1:33:18] <count_bob> The third gen ate them.
[1:33:18] <pmtriox> got ate
[1:33:18] <$PaleBloodInk> they were killed by the 3rds.
[1:33:18] <%PaladinDupre> Explosions seems to be very effective against Vampires. Why not just strap the sarcophogas to a nuke?
[1:33:19] <DingusMcBaseball> @AngriestPat be careful with spoilers man
[1:33:21] <deviljhojho94> Got merc'd
[1:33:21] <%manwithboxonhead> They are dead
[1:33:22] <+CaptainJax> 3rds were jerks and killed em
[1:33:24] <Dr_Mooose> well then
[1:33:26] <Atheistpreacher> Got ated
[1:33:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There was only a few @nd gen vamps, they're all dead
[1:33:30] <%SolidusRex> That's why the clan curses exist
[1:33:30] <+dukenux> Kars killed them
[1:33:31] <ooblag> Pretty much
[1:33:32] <Ominnous> 3rds became the strongest 2nd to cain
[1:33:32] <Meekest> That's lore stuff it's not spoilers
[1:33:32] <+Diabetic> yeah enoch's kids rose up and beat their asses
[1:33:32] <Psyramics> thats some real ancient myth shit
[1:33:33] <%augusm> all the clans weaknesses stem from Caine getting pissed off at them
[1:33:33] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> the 3rd are assholes
[1:33:35] <heybenice> Don’t vampires evaporate when they die?
[1:33:36] <washington1806> @natebud really i thought they just had the torah. one testament
[1:33:37] <%Frost_Quill> And Caine was PISSED by that.
[1:33:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> And then the Tremere ate a 3rd generation vampire
[1:33:40] <$Mighty_observer> no 2nd gen? thats stupid, like why halo only have 4th gen armor
[1:33:42] <%manwithboxonhead> Great fellows 👍🏻
[1:33:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> banana hammocks
[1:33:43] <fallacy8> 3 ate the 2nd and the curse is the punishment dealt by the first
[1:33:44] <zamzoph> Seven ate Nine
[1:33:46] <Mr_Rakjo> Cain is still BIG DADDY V
[1:33:47] <Etherealizer> That's why the Clans got cursed
[1:33:48] <jonathandemel> @AngriestPat That's why there's curses like Malkavian insanity
[1:33:49] <%SolidusRex> Cain cursed all the third generation for killing the second genration
[1:33:56] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat did you ever finished bloodlines back in the day?
[1:33:58] <%TheKekromancer> well there were onlly 3 seconds and 13 or 15 3rds to divide thier juice
[1:34:03] <+Diabetic> yeah Cain got mad and cursed the children to have the different clan shit
[1:34:03] <%CaptainTubaki> @heybenice turn into ash pretty much the same thing
[1:34:05] <DefaultSettiings> can this weird looking creature stop staring at us. and the npc could stop it also
[1:34:05] <yourliteraldog> @PaladinDupre it took an army vampires and a magic nuke to take one out when it woke up in india
[1:34:08] <SnaKemuho> Before the juice is spilled
[1:34:09] <%WackyGear> is cain alive?
[1:34:13] <natebud> @washington1806 Yeah, but it's referred to as the old testament by christians, catholics, ect.
[1:34:18] <deviljhojho94> Yeah give him a hand
[1:34:18] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat The 3rd Generations ate the 2nd generation to survive Noah's Flood and that pissed off Cain so he cursed their bloodlines, making the clans we have now
[1:34:19] <%stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Technically. 2nd gens got ate by 3rd gens. This is actually why the clans have their specific curses. Caine cursed all of the 3rd gens and their bloodlines. It's why Caine hates diablerie.
[1:34:20] <%Frost_Quill> @ZZCooldown He said in the first stream he played like to the end of Santa Monica or something.
[1:34:21] <$Mighty_observer> its the apple of eden, cut to assassins creed
[1:34:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> In WOD can female vampires get pregnant?
[1:34:26] <deviljhojho94> no

[1:34:47] <washington1806> @natebud ah. he said "jewish old testament" so that threw me for a loop but thats just that
[1:34:52] <joneworldbeater> The second generation ended when Picard split the timelines and they had to use the technobabble to undo the extinction of humanity
[1:34:53] <%Sovspot> Sovspot subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! When you play Skyrim, who are you going to side with? I personally wish there was a yes man option to tell everyone to fuck off.

[1:42:02] <%DSD24> @切捨御免 I am pretty sure Pat only did that cause that was his only option he never liked Lacroix
[1:42:05] <Matufreak> "my sarcophagus"
[1:42:06] <ooblag> The Sabbat are dicks, but they're dicks who want to kill the bigger, badder dicks

[1:42:57] <%thebonebard> i dont know the conversion rate for time though
[1:42:59] <Flare3500> daily reminder we got 400 dollars for killing a guy in a side quest

[1:44:11] <%stabbityrabbit> HOLY SHIT. Beckett perfectly summed up my thoughts on the Sabbat. Yeah, he's pretty cool.

[1:44:14] <turf_wind_and_fire> Hey gang, how's everything going?
[1:44:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Beckett's a swell dude.
[1:44:14] <%spiritofmojave> Beckett a smart boy
[1:44:15] <gkingsausagelink> woah
[1:44:15] <切捨御免> he's still a vampire
[1:44:17] <%Shikari21> Becket is a cool guy
[1:44:18] <LtSergei> he's euphoric
[1:44:19] <Flare3500> I think Jack says "it's been a crazy couple of nights " later
[1:44:24] <HeadsHeldHigh> Beckett is a furry
[1:44:26] <shlaggori> becket <3
[1:44:26] <%Edgy_Macaroon> classy man
[1:44:28] <%Solidnick18> 🤔
[1:44:32] <natebud> he's smug, but he hates the people I hate 4Head
[1:44:34] <%SunshineCaboose> I tried to flirt with him on my plythrough and that did NOT go well.

[1:45:45] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Ask Beckett about himself and say you're a scholar; you'll get a free research point
[1:45:47] <+dukenux> Beckett serves mostly as a lore dump
[1:45:51] <Shotred> in the lore I feel bad what happens to Beckett I hope they talk it in the next game, they dont say it here.

[1:47:38] <%augusm> Dracula is like 4th or 5th Gen, he got away with the Masquerade Violation cause there isn't really anybody strong enough around to actually pull him up to task
[1:47:39] <切捨御免> all the time
[1:47:39] <LtSergei> he forced his sire to embrace him and then diablerised his sire's sire
[1:47:40] <%Frost_Quill> No you'll know when you get to the point of no return.

[1:54:20] <fusedforms> ah, maybe you had to talk to her before LaCroix
[1:54:22] <Atheistpreacher> I thought this wasn;t supposed to happen yet?
[1:54:24] <lotharrio> She got clean and didn't want to live with her dealer anymore?
[1:54:26] <%AllyBeeBoo> I love how chat has to explain whether it's a bug not not
[1:54:27] <Mushball> wtf strauss you are the worst regent eve3r
[1:54:28] <$Mighty_observer> shes feral now
[1:54:29] <jonathandemel> She fixed herself and fucked off
[1:54:32] <%Frost_Quill> It's just a prop.
[1:54:33] <%spiritofmojave> It's a story thing if you don't tell her something in dialogue
[1:54:34] <%Frost_Quill> I think.
[1:54:34] <hntronium> there was a book on the bed
[1:54:36] <fusedforms> book fake
[1:54:39] <%brackboi> ! LUPUS !
[1:54:40] <%augusm> see if strauss has anything on the subject of Vampire Daddies
[1:54:42] <+Rolandknight> Did someone lose a ghoul. Tsk tak
[1:54:43] <hntronium> Book fake?
[1:54:43] <%Ilpala> it was huge
[1:54:46] <Matufreak> ah, right, I think she might be around if you feed her enough for a blood bond?
[1:54:47] <%konekoryugamine> Did he read through other posts?
[1:54:49] <%konekoryugamine> Or donations
[1:54:51] <%Frost_Quill> You did this when you got the haven too.
[1:54:53] <Flare3500> I thought you might have a chance to tell her to go home
[1:54:53] <flubber3d> it happens to the best of us, pay
[1:54:54] <%Pacup97> @turf_wind_and_fire don't mention it. it's a really good store.
[1:54:56] <%TheKekromancer> Strauss let it happen bc she was a distraction to his young apprentace
[1:54:56] <+TONYOO101> The line in the sand was left behind a while ago, your choices are now set in stone @AngriestPat
[1:54:56] <$Mighty_observer> the luous killed her LUL
[1:54:56] <natebud> Wiki says last chance you had to release her was before the church.
[1:55:02] <切捨御免> you can't dump yourself in there so...
[1:55:03] <%konekoryugamine> Because I legitimately wanted an answer for my question I had about my sister.
[1:55:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait why is she gone for no reason tho
[1:55:09] <gorillahandz> hey gamers, can I get a howdy
[1:55:11] <%konekoryugamine> She;s 11 but she's already calling herself an edgelord
[1:55:14] <$Mighty_observer> lupus
[1:55:19] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Like why isn't the game saying why she's gone?
[1:55:21] <gorillahandz> also hello Pat, hello chat!
[1:55:21] <%Frost_Quill> Does he still need the tremere book?
[1:55:22] <Tampaoster> howdy
[1:55:22] <MakeshiftSurgeon> Nyet!
[1:55:22] <%konekoryugamine> And enjoys Sonic the Hedgehog WAY too much
[1:55:23] <%ECRead> howdy
[1:55:24] <Run44forrest> howd
[1:55:26] <turf_wind_and_fire> @Pacup97 That's seriously good to know. I really only knew about a few services (the big ones primarily)
[1:55:28] <%Frost_Quill> Also does he need to talk to Strauss?
[1:55:28] <%manwithboxonhead> Heather BibleThump
[1:55:30] <godsabove> Hewwo?
[1:55:31] <silver__viii> howdy
[1:55:31] <yourliteraldog> you can use the console command to get her back G.Heather_Haven is set to 1
[1:55:33] <%spiritofmojave> howdy
[1:55:36] <sindegra> @Youwereeatenbyalid because that costs money because voice acting
[1:55:42] <Flare3500> Well it's too late now
[1:55:43] <%PaladinDupre> @konekoryugamine i believe thats called autism
[1:55:44] <gorillahandz> 'preciate it, pardners
[1:55:47] <unclerizla> to just survive as a human, would you need anything more than a blood "snus"?
[1:55:48] <+saltpiggu> @Youwereeatenbyalid I think its because he's not in the original apartment
[1:55:51] <%augusm> @Youwereeatenbyalid The game hints at why
[1:55:53] <%TheKekromancer> i think strauss is all set until endgame
[1:55:55] <Run44forrest> strauss wheres my hoe
[1:56:02] <jonathandemel> Do you still not know your way around?
[1:56:02] <Eepravenous> thank god thesel oading screens are quick
[1:56:03] <Youwereeatenbyalid> yeah good question
[1:56:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> What's the console command for the armor?
[1:56:07] <%spiritofmojave> n e o n a t e

[1:56:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @augusm where tho
[1:56:22] <%Pacup97> @turf_wind_and_fire it's also good to have them DRM free. you can technically share them with people, if you know how to.
[1:56:25] <natebud> Strauss used the console commands to make her disappear
[1:56:27] <skeleklng> Part of the quest @AngriestPat
[1:56:28] <$Mighty_observer> call her on her cell phone
[1:56:28] <%augusm> @Youwereeatenbyalid Spoilers
[1:56:30] <%konekoryugamine> @PaladinDupre No it's not. I have high functioning Autism and even I never went through that phase. I just wanted to know what to do about playing Sonic games with her. What does this have to do with my mental diagnoses?
[1:56:34] <+Rolandknight> Check your email
[1:56:34] <%brackboi> Listen to the sounds of the defense bees
[1:56:36] <%ECRead> ya girl went to Ram Ranch

[1:57:08] <yourliteraldog> are you still feeding info to the anarchs?
[1:57:09] <ooblag> Pat already bought the armor she can give you. It's fine
[1:57:10] <Mushball> I am more concerned is that she should be safe cause she's in a tremere chantry

[1:58:02] <DomunDomunDomun> goth gf?
[1:58:02] <%konekoryugamine> @PaladinDupre Never heard of it. And that's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. Aside from Sonichu.
[1:58:03] <ooblag> She was being followed
[1:58:03] <Atzros> God, I wish Damsel would throw me in a gulag and call me a filthy Cammy piggy
[1:58:05] <LtSergei> you'll find out
[1:58:06] <+drakthebest> She gets kidnapped by Sabbat
[1:58:09] <%augusm> @AngriestPat Spoilers
[1:58:09] <+dukenux> I AM OMEGA
[1:58:10] <tinypouf> sabbat took her
[1:58:11] <GoldeNOVA> That music is so edgy that if people write some parts of the lyrics they'll get banned Kapp
[1:58:13] <skeleklng> @AngriestPat She gets kidnapped and eat by Sabbat
[1:58:16] <%OldOnyx> @AngriestPat She should have mentioned that she was being stalked
[1:58:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @augusm that's not how that works tho
[1:58:16] <DracaenaLeaf> she heard noises
[1:58:17] <natebud> My guess is kidnapped
[1:58:17] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@GabeSweetMan)
[1:58:20] <Eepravenous> chat loves spoilers, huh
[1:58:20] <Matufreak> If bodily functions don't work, how long has Jack kept that beard undamaged?
[1:58:24] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat heather gives you the best armor too before dissapearing
[1:58:25] <fusedforms> she says she thought she was being followed iirc
[1:58:28] <+Taglog7> oh, now you care about heather
[1:58:30] <Flare3500> You'll see her in the main story
[1:58:30] <Run44forrest> aaah who cares just get a new heather
[1:58:32] <mesamus> @tinypouf SSSSSHHHH
[1:58:33] <$Mighty_observer> @dukenux I am Alpharius
[1:58:37] <%puhff> sHE DID
[1:58:38] <%konekoryugamine> That depends. How long should the bear get before he's mistaken for a member of ZZ Top?
[1:58:40] <thepowerofpinsol> she already mentioned that
[1:58:40] <+Mondeiya> another door
[1:58:41] <ミュウレ4242> in the plus patch, there are more things that can happen to heather.
[1:58:43] <thepowerofpinsol> chat is stupid
[1:58:44] <%puhff> Whoops
[1:58:44] <yourliteraldog> you cant save her?
[1:58:44] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ...uh oh
[1:58:46] <%PaladinDupre> @konekoryugamine my next idea was going to be to show her the Down The Rabbit Hole video on Chris Chan as a cautionary tale
[1:58:46] <%spiritofmojave> Sewer entrance
[1:58:50] <Dhurkst> Oh boy. Here we go.
[1:58:52] <natebud> She did mention the stalking previously
[1:58:53] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh my fucking god
[1:58:55] <silver__viii> She was bugged but she might still show up in the Hotel somewhere right?
[1:58:57] <KeystoneA1> @Matufreak Vampires always revert to how they were when they got embraced. So when Jack got embraced when he was a pirate in the 1600's, he had that beard.
[1:58:57] <jonathandemel> Convenient
[1:59:00] <%TheKekromancer> she must have gone out cause i think any sabbat who steped inside the chantry would just exploode
[1:59:00] <TwinBat> we go up
[1:59:01] <+ArmaIy> @yourliteraldog you can
[1:59:02] <@commanderclaw> The most jank shit ever
[1:59:03] <fusedforms> oh boy this fucking hotel
[1:59:05] <Mushball> is Pat using the unofficial patch or is this stock GOG
[1:59:09] <$Mighty_observer> Teen age mutant ninja vampires
[1:59:09] <%konekoryugamine> @PaladinDupre No, I don't want to scar her. She already knows Sonic 06 is garbage, so that's a bonus.
[1:59:11] <Dhurkst> Good luck, Pat.
[1:59:12] <+ArmaIy> @yourliteraldog gotta tell her to leave
[1:59:14] <tinypouf> @mesamus D: sorry i have a huge dumb mouth
[1:59:16] <KeystoneA1> @Matufreak If he shaved it off one night it'd be back like he didn't the next night
[1:59:17] <Youwereeatenbyalid> holy shit what a nightmare
[1:59:19] <Flare3500> @AngriestPat There was suppose to be a conversation where she kinda wants to go home
[1:59:20] <%spiritofmojave> Prepare for monotonous level design
[1:59:23] <+TONYOO101> hope pat's ready for the shittiest part of the game
[1:59:24] <Run44forrest> jacks 400 years old? cool
[1:59:24] <@commanderclaw> Stock GoG Is standard unofficial patch
[1:59:26] <%spiritofmojave> yes it is
[1:59:26] <Dhurkst> Yyyup
[1:59:29] <%nikoloas_> yeah
[1:59:32] <hntronium> flamethrowers!
[1:59:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Use Flamethrower
[1:59:36] <friendlyrogue> that boy's got some long-ass arms
[1:59:37] <+TONYOO101> cause this level goes on and on and on for eternity
[1:59:37] <%konekoryugamine> @TONYOO101 IS this this shittiest part of the game?
[1:59:38] <%DSD24> Honestly? its gonna suck
[1:59:44] <Marpolo13> that sick combat roll bruh
[1:59:44] <sindegra> pat! you liked conversations and lore? how about a big house full of nontalking generic enemies!
[1:59:44] <digaogrunge> SUCC
[1:59:47] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL the high gorund sucks
[1:59:48] <%DSD24> Cause you are a vampie
[1:59:49] <%PaladinDupre> @konekoryugamine anyway see if she likes Sonic Adventure 2 for GameCube
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:50] <natebud> probably ghouls
[1:59:50] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Welcome to die I guess
[1:59:52] <%spiritofmojave> Least you're geared pretty well for it
[1:59:52] <TwinBat> ghouls
[1:59:54] <mayorrev> thank u bot

[1:59:56] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I forget, did you bloodbuff?
[1:59:59] <ooblag> Ghouls
[1:59:59] <mayorrev> hail hydrate
[2:00:00] <%Frost_Quill> @konekoryugamine No, sewers are worse.
[2:00:01] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, Sabbat don't give a shit about the masquerade
[2:00:02] <Dhurkst> @konekoryugamine There's definitely worse
[2:00:02] <+Diabetic> What are you the Blood T-1000?
[2:00:02] <jonathandemel> Look for people without eyes
[2:00:02] <%OldOnyx> @yourliteraldog you can only prevent it with the plus patch if you want to keep her, other wise she would have needed to leave before now
[2:00:02] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ghouls apparently
[2:00:04] <%konekoryugamine> @PaladinDupre She's playing it on my PS3. Got it for sale.
[2:00:05] <gorillahandz> pat drink you gonna die
[2:00:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @konekoryugamine Nah, that's Nosferatu Warrens
[2:00:13] <%thebonebard> @AngriestPat look at the eyes of the passive humans
[2:00:14] <alexandrecau> in this location, in this time of the year
[2:00:17] <digaogrunge> Your punches are stronger

[2:00:18] <$Mighty_observer> just do the dirty fireworks
[2:00:21] <%konekoryugamine> Seems chat has varying opinions on which part of this game is the shittiest.
[2:00:24] <ZZCooldown> the sword does less dmg than the fists LUL
[2:00:26] <mojokingizakku> yo he final deathed that guy
[2:00:27] <+TONYOO101> @konekoryugamine yea, this was the part i figured they ran out of money and decided to copy and paste things out for like an hour
[2:00:29] <+Mondeiya> the game starts to become noticeably rushed around here unfort
[2:00:30] <%augusm> The humans are living blood bags
[2:00:31] <sindegra> "aw yeah"
[2:00:33] <%Frost_Quill> @Valentinius_Anodyne The warrens themselves are fine, it's the sewers that suck.
[2:00:35] <%spiritofmojave> Honestly there comes a point in this where you're better off just running for the exit than killing them all
[2:00:37] <%Pacup97> gonna use these emots all I can before my gift sub ends
[2:00:38] <%konekoryugamine> @TONYOO101 I can tell.
[2:00:40] <Atheistpreacher> Pat put nothing into melee
[2:00:43] <+Diabetic> This makes me miss Blood Omen 1
[2:00:50] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Blood Boil will work on most of the enemies in this arena
[2:00:52] <natebud> Now he chooses not to use guns

[2:01:09] <%augusm> FLAMMEN*
[2:01:12] <%PaladinDupre> @konekoryugamine well then monitor it as she moves through this phase and keep the chris chan video as a last resort
[2:01:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @waj9876 Eh, fair enough. I just tend to associate the two
[2:01:13] <Marpolo13> rad
[2:01:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> *final death*

[2:45:29] <%OldOnyx> @JenovasPuppet Beckett makes a lot of sense to show up anywhere given enough time. Being where all the shit is going down is kind of his deal half the time
[2:45:31] <jonathandemel> @Renkage098 I don't think that's physically possible
[2:45:32] <DingusMcBaseball> i would love it

[2:45:40] <+bear_breaker20> Id bbeleive it
[2:45:42] <Thirtine> no fuckin WAY
[2:45:42] <%ssjklyco> uses the fallout engine
[2:45:43] <GyroBrando> That would be great
[2:45:44] <ミュウレ4242> the sequel will launch w/ modding optionss, i hear.
[2:45:45] <%king_wragles> It would delete itself the instant you bought it
[2:45:45] <shamblerhero> I expect it to be more JANK
[2:45:46] <SnaKemuho> they should do it out of respect for the original
[2:45:47] <BoneofMalkav> Do we even know what engine Bloodlines 2 will be on?
[2:45:47] <natebud> This is still one of the jankiest games I've ever seen.
[2:45:48] <blackbaron98> if its playable IDGAF
[2:45:49] <kingra> Please let it be
[2:45:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Time for some apatBig Decisions.
[2:45:49] <xeros720> the sequel just starts up Stalker: Shadow of Cherynobyl
[2:45:50] <%sshen> Then it would be anthem
[2:45:50] <$cureneckbeard> don't antedeluvian open inside
[2:45:50] <InugamiTheHound> are they using source engine or unreal for new bloodlines game
[2:45:52] <$CarlosEoM> Vampire 76
[2:45:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> It uses the Fallout 76 Engine
[2:45:54] <%valkuma> the only thing the sequel is gonna have more of is Current day politics that become old and irrelevant after 3 months
[2:45:57] <mesamus> 1
[2:45:59] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I want it to be 10 times more expansive than this game and 10 times more broken
[2:45:59] <+kraajkase> There HAS to be some level of jank
[2:45:59] <+TONYOO101> surprise, its actually on the quake engine this time
[2:46:00] <%Das_Bass> with all my hear
[2:46:00] <SpookyBeef7> The sequel would have to be Anthem levels of broken.

[2:53:45] <silver__viii> Oh wow this save point is fucked
[2:53:46] <shotgang86> LUL
[2:53:47] <CptBritches> Smooooth
[2:53:47] <outis94> Seduce the wolf pat
[2:53:49] <jonathandemel> Autosave would be nice
[2:53:51] <alwayspronking> but what about the backup save?
[2:53:54] <the_hexe> Wolf'd LUL LUL LUL
[2:53:55] <silver__viii> Quicksave when the wolf spawns i think
[2:53:56] <natebud> That wolfboy is an environmental hazard.
[2:53:58] <mannywatcha> God damn it
[2:54:00] <+Estuko> @theshillman TwitchCop
[2:54:02] <Renkage> @ShadowArcangel No. They are just a hard counter to anything involving physical activities. Including beating yo ass. Vampires have magic though, but that can only do so much
[2:54:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> WoD Fera are super badass
[2:54:04] <%Das_Bass> So even Vampires are not the Apex hunters
[2:54:04] <sindegra> pat therei s a way to kill the werewolf. but it doesn't involve combat directly
[2:54:05] <%MagickBurritoh> so bloodboil doesn't work on wolf?
[2:54:06] <%TheKekromancer> only gens like around 8 and higher can 1v1 werewolves
[2:54:08] <SnaKemuho> yeah, should've leveled seduction Kappa
[2:54:09] <flubber3d> doubt we're getting to skyrim tonight

[2:54:26] <godzookylives> "who even needs a shit"
[2:54:26] <bigles000> vampires in world of darkness are kinda low on the foodchain
[2:54:26] <+TheBigO75> Vampires piss thier pants around them
[2:54:27] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Nines got yeeted
[2:54:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> There is an environmental puzzle kill
[2:54:28] <Hazlet95> maybe run like 9S was telling you to
[2:54:33] <Archmortal> using Bloodboil on a Werewolf is about as potent and Captain Marvel being in space
[2:54:33] <Madbearv> lower gen vamps can take them

[3:16:11] <skeleklng> 5 Endings, but really only like 2. Anarch ending is the same as LaCroix except what happens to you at the end. Struass ending doesn't tell you everything at the end, and the other ones are bad ending (Join the Chinese Vamps you get killed, join Sabbat you die, or just leave)

[3:16:43] <%TheKekromancer> ask mercurio about people
[3:16:45] <%SolidusRex> Ask him about people
[3:16:47] <jonathandemel> BEST ending
[3:16:54] <%augusm> The only time in the game that you need ammo more than blood and its the only time he starts spending all his cash on blood

[3:17:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> @buffmurffy it's called captain marvel
[3:17:58] <%stabbityrabbit> Huh, had no clue this game let you be proper independent. It really is the best choice in setting. Every part of kindred society is terrible.
[3:18:00] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Insert flashback to policenauts "no time to fuck around!"
[3:18:03] <Atzros> look out, he has a knife
[3:18:04] <$Big_Dream> no dmg
[3:18:04] <Archmortal> @SirKamBam PC. You can still use a controller, you just have to set up the cross-bars
[3:18:06] <Run44forrest> is this vampire HATRED now?
[3:18:07] <%QuadraticGravity> @SirKamBam has crossplay, but you can use controller or M&K on PC
[3:18:08] <mannywatcha> We just gonna straight up kill everyone?
[3:18:08] <%Laecerelius> Eat those bitches!!
[3:18:09] <Animal_Farm4> @SirKamBam You can use controller for PC version if that matters
[3:18:09] <PerrinIsDead> Whey?
[3:18:12] <GothicLoveBlood> Kue jin actually
[3:18:12] <skeleklng> @AngriestPat Strauss is my favorite ending but I'd recommend you do it after doing the independent ending, that way you get the full picture.
[3:18:13] <reiju_22> I hate this part
[3:18:14] <%manwithboxonhead> LUL LUL LUL
[3:18:14] <fairore> I hope more crazy shit in the next game
[3:18:15] <%Frost_Quill> @SirKamBam You can plat pc version with controller.
[3:18:16] <therakishsage> This is going to be rough, Pat. Nah, these guys are Kuei-Jin. They just don't burn up like Kindred do.
[3:18:17] <LtSergei> i would suggest melee to save ammo
[3:18:18] <%SolidusRex> If only this were the plus patch
[3:18:20] <Vestrai> @SirKamBam Its dependant on your rig, PC is better by far, PS4 is a safe option and you can use Keyboard and Mouse or controller for both
[3:18:22] <%idyota> i just came in, who is he siding with?
[3:18:22] <AlasterAngelo> did he do the yukie quest
[3:18:22] <%augusm> swooord
[3:18:28] <%nekodelic> SWORD
[3:18:29] <@commanderclaw> Katana would work
[3:18:30] <%SolidusRex> In the plus patch, Yukie will co-op this part
[3:18:31] <%spiritofmojave> wait isn't that OC weeb character supposed to be here
[3:18:31] <+brakkathoom> is Yuki there to help or is that only in plus patch

[3:19:52] <mesamus> stop using melee, he has no points in it
[3:19:53] <%spiritofmojave> That guy just phased out of reality
[3:19:53] <Sokumotanaka> This isn't jade empire
[3:19:55] <+thebloodbottler> yeah the plus patch is a bit of a mess
[3:19:59] <yourliteraldog> full auto shotty
[3:20:03] <%augusm> @Eepravenous This isn't plus patch
[3:20:08] <%theneosloth> the plus patch lets you shoot the werewolf in the last section. That should tell you enough

[3:20:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> You killed Goku!!
[3:20:47] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Try and stealth kill one of them with a sword if you get the chance. It's neat.
[3:20:49] <%DSD24> What about that Katana?
[3:20:53] <+saltpiggu> @theneosloth that sounds like a bad addition
[3:20:53] <+Manjove> Pat should play Jade Empire, i agree
[3:20:54] <%Sulliman34> wow this looks fun
[3:20:55] <Zombrocom> Can you pick and choose what the plus patch adds? Or is it all or nothing?
[3:20:56] <%nekodelic> CROSSBOW

[3:21:23] <%Promessa_EX> you're in the shit so chug
[3:21:23] <Jack8274> @sindegra He might need those later. Mind goblins at play\
[3:21:24] <%theneosloth> @saltpiggu it's that times a thousand. Lots of unnecessary and sometimes baffling changes
[3:21:25] <kingra> Siiiiip
[3:21:25] <silver__viii> Sippy on blood boy

[3:22:23] <+SodiusChubz> wheres kain when you need him
[3:22:25] <+thebloodbottler> the plus patch also "restores" some cut quests that are less than stellar
[3:22:26] <DracaenaLeaf> no @JenovasPuppet /late
[3:22:26] <Lurantis_> Can you do a stealth build for this game or does it not really support it?
[3:22:29] <%Binary_Fireball> but he also prosucc
[3:22:30] <LtSergei> blood strike and salvo dude, also i don't think slow mode is neccessary any more
[3:22:33] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Plus patch adds shortcuts that let you skip most of this
[3:22:38] <+ArmaIy> up your brawl to feed on these guys
[3:22:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is that a colon?
[3:22:42] <%blastazoid26> Pat is using consumables?
[3:22:42] <+ShadowArcangel> just remembered: this place has the worst puzzle in the gmae
[3:22:43] <Mr_Rakjo> @Lurantis_ if you play nosferatu the game becomes a sealth game
[3:22:43] <+SpiceMastah> Pat is in his gamer CUBE
[3:22:43] <%DSD24> I wish you got the Soul Reaver right now
[3:22:44] <+Afrobrawler> does pat still have his flamethrower?
[3:22:51] <aristomuse> i hate this place so much lmao
[3:22:53] <shamblerhero> mingmingmingming
[3:22:53] <Animal_Farm4> @Lurantis_ It works for some sections but this and a few others there's no way to stealth
[3:22:53] <+saltpiggu> @theneosloth noted. And here I thought I was missing out with the plus patch
[3:22:54] <%DSD24> @Afrobrawler Pretty sure he does
[3:22:55] <%nekodelic> @lurantis_ you can, but you'll struggle on the Hollowbrook Hotel mission
[3:22:55] <%theneosloth> I think clan quest mod adds the shortcuts too and it has actually passable quests too
[3:22:56] <%Laecerelius> Why waste the flamethrower on humans?
[3:23:02] <%manwithboxonhead> @sodiuschubz Sitting on the throne with the Pillars of Nosgoth.
[3:23:03] <%TheKekromancer> welcome to my personal least favorite part
[3:23:05] <+Estuko> @shamblerhero Banana Phone
[3:23:05] <%MonsieurHedge> this place is a blast with a brawl/protean gangrel
[3:23:08] <takiyami> btw bloodshield went away
[3:23:10] <ValidVenasaur> Nosferatu is a stealth build i believe @lurantis_
[3:23:10] <PerrinIsDead> Whey
[3:23:20] <NocturnalRites> I hated the boss fight for this area so much, the puzzles werent that great either
[3:23:23] <Zombrocom> Why are we in 2 minute slow mode anyway? Never seen any chat modes on this channel before, that's mew
[3:23:25] <%QuadraticGravity> is that Anakin Skywalker
[3:23:36] <@absolute_weapon> You have to have blood packs to win the game, Pat
[3:23:38] <kingra> Slooooooow chaaaaaat
[3:23:40] <%ElenaManetta> Because that's how it is on this basement we call Earth
[3:23:42] <%theneosloth> this area is probably my least favorite in the game. I like the next section a fair bit more
[3:23:42] <GothicLoveBlood> They're Kuei jin
[3:23:42] <%Sulliman34> @Zombrocom maybe cause its the end of the game? unsure
[3:23:42] <%thebonebard> because the place is sacred
[3:23:43] <sindegra> they're not huamn beings possibly, they[re kue-jin that don't dissolve?
[3:23:45] <@absolute_weapon> here be blood packs
[3:23:46] <%copyritetm> those are all kue jin
[3:23:47] <%logoth_> Guy in robes doing dodge rolls to someone with a heavy weapon, wtf

[3:23:55] <%brakkathoom> They don't really turn people like vamoires do.
[3:23:55] <%JenovasPuppet> Kuei Jin aren't human, but they aren't vampires either.
[3:24:02] <切捨御免> not buddha reeeeee
[3:24:03] <$CarlosEoM> so you can s u c c
[3:24:05] <%TheKekromancer> theyre not kuei jin auspex tells u
[3:24:08] <Doodle_Taco> "Hey man"
[3:24:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> Kuei Jin are a different type of monster
[3:24:10] <ItsKitKat_> you made a good choice filling up with blood packs

[3:24:27] <Lurantis_> tfw u wanna thank the 5 people giving you information about the game but you have to wait 2 minutes for each of them
[3:24:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Master Oogway is waiting for you to become the dragon warrior at the jade palace
[3:24:35] <Run44forrest> 2 min slow mode. ok mods
[3:24:35] <%Ilpala> fuckin rude
[3:24:37] <%QuadraticGravity> Imagine being restricted by slow mode cause you didn't use Twitch Prime on Pat
[3:24:41] <%Laecerelius> That has a nice radius to it
[3:24:42] <Eepravenous> Ill waste as many minutes as i like!
[3:24:44] <+Lolsoar> Why the FUCK would anyone use a crossbow in this situation
[3:24:55] <AlasterAngelo> Is "hey yu" mandarin for something?
[3:24:56] <%Bupkis7> @Lolsoar It's a fire crossbow and vampires are weak to fire.
[3:24:58] <%Ilpala> I'm eatin here!
[3:25:00] <%theneosloth> crossbows do more damage to vampires
[3:25:01] <+thebloodbottler> because guns are dishonorabru
[3:25:03] <the_hexe> Mods = BrokeBack for 2 Min slow mode.
[3:25:10] <Finakala> Crossbow literally fires stakes

[4:05:56] <ミュウレ4242> i missed it, did he put the body armor back on?
[4:05:57] <+Spec7re> Hey LaCroix your goons are just making me STRONGER

[4:05:59] <RickyRelucent> i wonder how much time its gonna take to kill the behemoth
[4:05:59] <energywarning> augmo
[4:05:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> bleedpurple500 bonus50 Troika says that he's Caine. White Wolf says he's a Malkavian Primogen that thinks he's Caine. Malk players do have a freakout revelaiton during these endgame rides. Interesting sidenote: La Croix Dominates you if you refuse his jobs, but for the last job, he tries and fails, almost as if your Generation number became superior to his... and that Tzimisce did mention your blood was more potent than the last time you met. Caine absolutely could juice you up.
[4:06:00] <SoaringLettuce> swat? more like SWAT THE FUCK CAN YOU DO?
[4:06:02] <Jack8274> I'm just waiting for the music to say "Smack my bitch up"

[4:06:12] <%manwithboxonhead> @thekekromancer It is through the non-Kevlar parts
[4:06:14] <Conky89> Did you just give HUNK a deadly hickey?
[4:06:15] <T_Sasquatch> succed
[4:06:27] <+Reizie_Etherealm> No amount of tactical military tech can amount to GUN MAGE
[4:06:28] <%TheKekromancer> it is actually a joke
[4:06:31] <Ion_Laser> Freeze!
[4:06:39] <Bogart4321> lol they bounce around
[4:06:42] <unclerizla> @Jack8274 oof, a harder scene with that era of electro would be sick

[4:07:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> HOW!?
[4:07:48] <+saltpiggu> @GeneralSCPatton Age can also increase potency, so perhaps just by the end of the game you've gotten strong enough to push out Lacroix's dominate
[4:07:49] <shotgang86> man its non-stop jank in the final parts of this game, I love it
[4:07:49] <mojokingizakku> it's a me, blood vampire

[4:08:05] <+thebloodbottler> its almost like they didnt get to finish this game
[4:08:07] <+Manjove> GUN
[4:08:08] <%BlueMoonBlues> no shut up it's COD now
[4:08:10] <+bear_breaker20> You forgot this game is the matrix
[4:08:12] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> I mean it might still be at the very end
[4:08:14] <%crimsonharvest> mass suicide is fun
[4:08:14] <flubber3d> the last few hours is pure murder
[4:08:14] <Croetec> and he didn't want to gun Kappa
[4:08:15] <mesamus> that would be stupid pat
[4:08:16] <ミュウレ4242> this is another very rushed part of the game.
[4:08:16] <InugamiTheHound> can some clip that animation of the guys dancing when they get shot
[4:08:17] <Thirtine> then you shoudl play Planescape Torment
[4:08:18] <unclerizla> @AngriestPat You know the dude youre killing, hes gonna try to argue

[4:08:26] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat it said 8, buff and do it
[4:08:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Like with the Pillars of Eternity boss, or Saren?

[4:10:42] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Conky89 he's the AC:Unity vampire
[4:10:45] <Mushball> Sheriff is the big guy with the sword

[4:10:51] <Bogart4321> splinter cell?
[4:10:53] <Jack8274> @flubber3d Because then he would have to use blood bags and that means using items

[4:11:42] <切捨御免> ridiculous overconfidence?
[4:11:42] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> noshutuptho

[4:13:06] <+Estuko> their death noise reminds me of Jedi Academy
[4:13:08] <T_Sasquatch> I didn't expect it to turn into fps man LUL

[4:18:55] <natebud> FLAMETHROWER
[4:18:55] <%QuadraticGravity> You just randomly turned them on
[4:18:58] <shotgang86> I think you have to use when the bat passes

[4:26:43] <%Binary_Fireball> hahahahaha
[4:26:43] <cayvalentine> yep it was literally a shitty plan just to bomb lacroix
[4:26:43] <GothicLoveBlood> Jack opened it on the ship switched out for c4 for the mummy
[4:26:43] <%ElenaManetta> it's symbolic of video games
[4:26:43] <seth45er> jack came to town the same day the dane showed up
[4:26:44] <%SunshineCaboose> Perfect Game
[4:26:44] <ミュウレ4242> jack is a pirate. he raided a ship. not a suprise.
[4:26:44] <%MagickBurritoh> YES YES YES
[4:26:44] <shotgang86> LUL
[4:26:45] <@commanderclaw> That's Correct
[4:26:45] <EuropantLamprey> It went Raiders on us
[4:26:45] <%logoth_> It had the mummy named Kiwan
[4:26:45] <%manwithboxonhead> NOOoOoOo
[4:26:45] <+Th3SmartAlec> It had the mummy until Jack pulled him out
[4:26:45] <Coystick> The real vampires were the friedns me made along the way
[4:26:45] <%Laecerelius> You murdered so many assholes!
[4:26:46] <Sokumotanaka> Jack was joseph joestar the whole time
[4:26:46] <GodzScrtAgnt> great way of looking at it ;)
[4:26:46] <therakishsage> Wasn't pointless - it made you STRONG.
[4:26:46] <Jack_Nightshadow> Yes it was
[4:26:46] <simulationbard> it was just a mummy like the guy said
[4:26:46] <GyroBrando> Yea
[4:26:47] <Megapikman132> That guy with him was the mummy
[4:26:47] <beetbo2> But it was I, Jack
[4:26:47] <%weissguard> Game OVER YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
[4:26:48] <%s_xylocalsingles> @angriestpat Jack took the corpse a long time ago
[4:26:48] <%Over_ninek> that's fuckign hilarious
[4:26:48] <+kojibeoulve> basically jack was playing everyone
[4:26:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Jack got it first
[4:26:49] <fusedforms> it's THE BEST
[4:26:49] <%butch_deadlift> just like life
[4:26:49] <ooblag> This was all a ploy by Jack and Caine
[4:26:49] <ameraaaaaa> we did it!
[4:26:50] <+Tadashi047> yes
[4:26:50] <Resonance86> KINO
[4:26:50] <%thebonebard> yep, well at least you fucked with that fuck
[4:26:50] <+TheGreatCrusader> Told you that opening it was fine
[4:26:50] <+Strigiform> Jack hates politics
[4:26:50] <Bogart4321> he timed those bombs perfectly too
[4:26:50] <Renkage> Point was to kill LaDouche
[4:26:51] <AnacondaVirtue> Jack used the box as bait to rile up the different factions in the city
[4:26:51] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Just a prank bro
[4:26:51] <%IDTheftVictim> Everyone told you not to open it.
[4:26:51] <%theneosloth> it's not pointless, whoever opens the box is the biggest asshole and they'll die
[4:26:51] <efratzy> truth is, the game was rigged from the start
[4:26:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Jack PLAY US LIKE A DAMN FIDDLE
[4:26:51] <Valask> almost like a masquerade
[4:26:52] <lotharrio> It was full of bombs the whole time! That's got points.
[4:26:52] <Atzros> The point was killing LaCroix
[4:26:52] <unclerizla> dude let the credits play ffs
[4:26:52] <$Mighty_observer> how did they open it the first time?
[4:26:52] <%nekodelic> WHEN YOU'RE TAAAAAAAAUGH
[4:26:52] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat expectations = subverted
[4:26:52] <%Freelance7> You killed an asshole, how is that pointless?
[4:26:53] <Archer27> oh mercurio was literally talking about the devs LUL i'm oblivious
[4:26:53] <mar_krow> Just think Dio
[4:26:53] <natebud> Would have ended sooner if someone didn't steal the key early on.
[4:26:53] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat But what about the friends you made along the way?
[4:26:53] <%rdark_ksu> lots of blood for literally no reason
[4:26:54] <+McSnazzyPants> beckett was scared of c4
[4:26:54] <flubber3d> "pointless"
[4:26:54] <candidateplays> Yep. What everyone felt, the Presence? That was the Driver. jack was manipulating you the whole time
[4:26:54] <Dramtheater> dramthFeelsHei
[4:26:54] <Frostydough> just like life
[4:26:54] <GoldeNOVA> THE DUDE WAS RIGHT THERE
[4:26:55] <+TheSaintJohn> pat got got
[4:26:55] <Run44forrest> das how vampire work
[4:26:55] <Dhurkst> Ring a ding, baby!
[4:26:56] <+Mondeiya> ye, bc the sarco was meant to turn the city into chaos
[4:26:56] <GodzScrtAgnt> the 2 biggest factions died
[4:26:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Shut up! Buttrock tho!
[4:26:56] <%spiritofmojave> Jack is a mastermind
[4:26:56] <%crimsonharvest> Yes except you got to kill the guy who could end you on his say so
[4:26:57] <Eepravenous> Not really, it still needed to get to the top of the tower
[4:26:57] <+sourceofall> well, it was to kill lacroix in as funny a way as jack could come up with
[4:26:57] <lionmanguy> No
[4:26:57] <Lolcola34> Jack did it for the lulz
[4:26:57] <RupanSen> Jack-in-the-Box
[4:26:58] <sindegra> you happy pat?!
[4:26:58] <theshillman> played like a damn fiddle
[4:26:59] <+Mondeiya> which it did
[4:26:59] <lionmanguy> Pat
[4:26:59] <PappdaddySr> Pat Blew uo the Millenium tower, its always Yakuza
[4:26:59] <yourliteraldog> So no antideluvian
[4:27:00] <Conky89> No. It was all a setup on LaCroix.
[4:27:00] <%copyritetm> it was all jack just fucking with everyone, he won from go
[4:27:00] <%MonsieurHedge> the visions of damnation were probably the presence of Caine
[4:27:01] <skeleklng> @AngriestPat If you did the Strauss ending you put it in a warehouse and never found out about Jack's plan
[4:27:01] <mannywatcha> what happens to your character after this game/ does he just fuck off?
[4:27:01] <%TheKekromancer> its still the end times just not from the coffin
[4:27:02] <lionmanguy> There was a dude in it
[4:27:03] <Senenryu> It back an antiduluvean mummy
[4:27:03] <%Promessa_EX> so was the mummy alive
[4:27:03] <%AncelDeLambert> Time to read the wiki lore!!
[4:27:05] <lionmanguy> Jack took him out
[4:27:05] <%Rngiddion> i love this game
[4:27:07] <Patzzki217> jack REALLY hates lacroix
[4:27:07] <%Agami23> ballsy move, i'll give them that
[4:27:08] <KitsuneSidhe> @AngriestPat Not really pointless per se. It was just all part of Jack's plan to spread a bit of chaos.
[4:27:09] <lionmanguy> And replaced him with c4
[4:27:10] <%thebonebard> just a corpse
[4:27:11] <%Niney_Who> 🖕

[4:27:39] <DracaenaLeaf> that a look at what
[4:27:39] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat remember that everyone keep saying they felt something weird in town, it was not the sarcophagus it was cain in the cab LUL
[4:27:39] <EuropantLamprey> Raider's of the lost Sarcophagus
[4:27:40] <Tucker0603> jack plays everyone.
[4:27:41] <therakishsage> Also the cabby's Caine - he can play everybody just the same.
[4:27:42] <%thebonebard> at least jack won
[4:27:42] <majindusto> Can't wait for the sequel
[4:27:43] <SnaKemuho> check a look
[4:27:43] <skeleklng> The father of all vampies is a fucking cab driver
[4:27:44] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat The Cab driver is totally caine
[4:27:45] <VJdarkworld> Based jack
[4:27:52] <%ssjklyco> It MASQUERADED as a valuable item
[4:27:54] <metalwater8> Can you do the other endings?
[4:27:56] <%Promessa_EX> i bet the contents change if you open it

[4:28:17] <%SvenHolgersson> Do the shit one
[4:28:18] <InugamiTheHound> So the guy in sarcophagus is a mummy
[4:28:19] <DracaenaLeaf> time to die
[4:28:19] <%TheKekromancer> cabbie is either cain or an old malkavian who thinks hes caine
[4:28:21] <Dhurkst> @Spec7re Never gets old.
[4:28:22] <+cahv123> When you've done it all there is a pleasure in something so mundane as being a cab driver.

[4:29:23] <%thebonebard> yep dont open
[4:29:23] <Archer27> that's some WIL E coyote shit
[4:29:24] <majindusto> Big Oops
[4:29:26] <Eepravenous> "youre probably wondering how i got here"
[4:29:28] <%SunshineCaboose> The fortune teller gives away the whole game
[4:29:31] <%Sulliman34> i feel like jack is more than jack
[4:29:32] <lionmanguy> Oh wait
[4:29:34] <+Mekhet09> that's the corpse by the way.
[4:29:35] <+TheSaintJohn> awoooo
[4:29:35] <mar_krow> mr cain
[4:29:38] <lionmanguy> That's a methusula not an antideluvian?
[4:29:41] <%SvenHolgersson> Its V Man
[4:29:42] <T_Sasquatch> seriously what's the mummy for
[4:29:43] <skeleklng> The fortune teller at the beach was right all along
[4:29:43] <+SolverCODO> Look at all that flowing evil juice
[4:29:44] <+thebloodbottler> its a corpse
[4:29:45] <Megapikman132> That other guy is the mummy, yeah
[4:29:45] <GothicLoveBlood> @AngriestPat there's also a secret easter ending
[4:29:47] <ScreamingMeat> It was never a Vampire Coffin to begin with, LUL
[4:29:47] <+thebloodbottler> just a corpse
[4:29:47] <ItsKitKat_> hi cane
[4:29:48] <Jack8274> So stupid LUL
[4:29:48] <%thebonebard> @AngriestPat go back to the decision part in the cab to get a cool thing with nines
[4:29:49] <DracaenaLeaf> n odifference?
[4:29:49] <%Sulliman34> watch all endings on youtube patron
[4:29:50] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat remember that everyone keep saying they felt something weird in town, it was not the sarcophagus it was cain in the cab LUL
[4:29:50] <fusedforms> it's just an old corpse
[4:29:51] <RantingRavager> LUL
[4:29:51] <flubber3d> missing dialog?
[4:29:51] <%copyritetm> OH thats glitched
[4:29:52] <%SunshineCaboose> She's always right
[4:29:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Jack is old as fuck, he's possibly Black Beard
[4:29:52] <Wan6Saber> no third option?
[4:29:52] <+Reizie_Etherealm> That chad aura tho
[4:29:53] <candidateplays> Literally a Jack in the Box
[4:29:53] <jonathandemel> So dumb
[4:29:54] <mannywatcha> Game finished
[4:29:54] <zamzoph> But what about hte last one?
[4:29:55] <Dhurkst> @AngriestPat Jack is supposed to comment on your final choice, not sure why he isn't.
[4:29:56] <Meekest> The mummy is just an old-ass vampire mummy
[4:29:58] <Jack8274> GG
[4:29:58] <+ahegotrigger> it is
[4:29:59] <natebud> Nah, that's great. You got played.
[4:29:59] <%ssjklyco> Get it, a masquerade
[4:30:03] <%SunshineCaboose> "You have been, no you are going to china:
[4:30:05] <$Mighty_observer> LP ova
[4:30:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> big poop
[4:30:06] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh noooo
[4:30:06] <RupanSen> I think it's a great ending
[4:30:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Of course the fortune teller was right, she's a Malk
[4:30:07] <unclerizla> Pat you are such an ass, did not even watch the credits
[4:30:08] <$Big_Dream> booooooooo
[4:30:08] <%SunshineCaboose> "Is it the father behind him?"
[4:30:09] <flubber3d> SKYRIM
[4:30:10] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Yeah fair
[4:30:15] <%copyritetm> that was glitched, he is supposed to say too bad about the kid
[4:30:19] <Coystick> Skamram
[4:30:19] <%theneosloth> this ending is so fitting for the setting
[4:30:20] <SnaKemuho> skipped the best song NotLikeThis
[4:30:25] <mar_krow> DovahPat
[4:30:26] <ooblag> That's great. It's not a story about some super powerful McGuffin, it's a story about factions destroying themselves and each other in pursuit of more power
[4:30:34] <%theneosloth> you get played by vampires older and more powerful than you
[4:30:35] <+drakthebest> There's another ending where you side with the kuei-jin. They give you concrete boots and dump you into the ocean after you give them the city.
[4:30:36] <%thebonebard> so for those that want to know what happens with nines if you choose anarchs you meet nines in the hotel in hollywood and he has the corpse of the werewolf on the bed
[4:30:39] <+ahegotrigger> I dont blame pat for being salty about that ending
[4:30:40] <%Wrashis> people should know pat is not a fan of "the entire game was for nothing" endings
[4:30:41] <unclerizla> @SnaKemuho yeah for fucking realz
[4:30:45] <DomunDomunDomun> Has pat posted a modlist for skyrimjobs?
[4:30:47] <ooblag> Not even more power, the HINT of more power
[4:30:47] <Sokumotanaka> @ooblag What you said
[4:30:49] <Doodle_Taco> Well everyone, I should have asleep since long see you KonCha
[4:30:50] <+ahegotrigger> it was funny though
[4:30:52] <+BigBruthaThunda> Why are we still here, just to suffer?
[4:30:53] <%Niney_Who> The entire game WASN'T for nothing
[4:30:56] <%Niney_Who> You got to kill La Croix
[4:30:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I love how Jack is just chilling out, he knows he could rule the world, but he knows better than to try
[4:30:58] <%SunshineCaboose> But it isn't for nothing
[4:30:59] <natebud> The game was for something because LaCroix is dead.
[4:31:06] <NocturnalRites> Well in laCroixs case he screwed everyone over for power cause hes a Ventrue and thats how they do
[4:31:06] <%SunshineCaboose> You watch a society implode
[4:31:08] <Run44forrest> so 3 endings?
[4:31:15] <%spiritofmojave> I mean the pursuit of nothing-power is hilarious for all the factions pettiness
[4:31:17] <therakishsage> That implies that "the entire game was for nothing", which is wasn't. But hey - it's easy to see how it could appear that way.
[4:31:21] <GothicLoveBlood> Everyone was fighting for nothing over a regular old ass corpse LUL
[4:31:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> The real La Croix was the friends we made along the way.
[4:31:28] <%GabeSweetMan> You still DO a LOT of stuff in this game. The ending doesn't change that.
[4:31:34] <%theneosloth> the idea is that whoever opens the sarcophagus is the most power hungry asshole in LA so the whole game is just jack playing 5d chess
[4:31:37] <%GabeSweetMan> You destroy entire factions!
[4:31:41] <%SeveredWing> SeveredWing subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:31:41] <SnaKemuho> the entirety of Dark Souls is for nothing, and Pat loves it
[4:31:45] <%AncelDeLambert> the actual macguffin is control of the city, that's the real plot
[4:31:50] <Wan6Saber> 5d chess indeed athEZ
[4:31:53] <%SunshineCaboose> you're bossed around the whole game by vampires who think they have the answers, or are more important than you, and you watch their world collapse
[4:31:53] <Sokumotanaka> Well I was satisfied with killing LAcroix and blowing him up I don't see the problem here
[4:31:54] <Run44forrest> so was beckett just in on it
[4:31:58] <%idyota> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib emlo wants sarcophagus
[4:32:00] <%AncelDeLambert> This game is basically the end of FONV in LA
[4:32:06] <therakishsage> Jack probably just told Beckett what the deal was.
[4:32:08] <natebud> The chest is just a huge red herring.
[4:32:13] <therakishsage> And he decided to do you a solid and warn you.
[4:32:14] <mar_krow> i wanted power but but i got nothing in the end
[4:32:16] <%TheKekromancer> Jack told beckett
[4:32:17] <Latija> in vampire over? time for skrim?
[4:32:17] <%Wrashis> the ending implies that one of the primary plot points was for nothing, which leaves pat with the impression that "i did all that to get this shit for nothing?"
[4:32:18] <ooblag> The other three endings are Anarchs: Pretty much the same, but more friendly with Nines, Camerilla: Strauss locks it the coffin away, Raider of the Lost Ark style, and Kuejin: they throw you, and the sarcophogus into the bottom of the see, Dio style
[4:32:19] <%Hammerknife> Hammerknife subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hi Pat, I'm making an indie game and I'm going to make a Pat mode, where all items are consumables, consumables are required to progress at any point in the story, nothing regenerates naturally, and 90% of all items are useless but are suspiciously named.
[4:32:24] <JayEarly> I hated the ending at first but now I love it
[4:32:25] <MasterDecoder> He still going? Or finishing up?
[4:32:37] <%Kirby_Sauce> bleedpurple500 bonus50 So TTS did a joke where the dark eldar called each other their "main melf" a play on words of main man and elf. I wanted to do something like that for you, involving your gingerhood, but that word already means something... any last surprises for us pat? "Sure kirby! Hey paige, shotgun wedding?"
[4:32:41] <+Th3SmartAlec> good night
[4:32:48] <natebud> There's also an ending where you side with the Chinese vampires.
[4:32:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @ooblag what dumbass allies with the fucking Kuei-jin?
[4:32:58] <%thebonebard> AND NOW YOU the chat can tell future generations of vampires not to open it

[4:33:06] <ooblag> I was like 15
[4:33:20] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL you dork
[4:33:20] <Monkeyweed21> I get to say
[4:33:23] <therakishsage> End spoilers? Pat's not gonna bother playing through this terrible ending part of the game.
[4:33:30] <mar_krow> always open it for the power
[4:33:30] <%SeveredWing> this game taught me what a "Donkey Show" is....
[4:33:40] <natebud> @ooblag one who gets locked in the sarcophagus and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
[4:33:41] <Wan6Saber> Kappa
[4:33:42] <%TheKekromancer> the events of the end are the same regardless its just what faction is alive
[4:33:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> Snape killed dumbledore
[4:33:50] <JayEarly> @pandora_prime We finished the game
[4:33:52] <SnaKemuho> don't spoil the giant dancing werewolf
[4:33:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Now that he's gotten AN ending he probably won't mind just being told the other paths.
[4:33:57] <%SeveredWing> SeveredWing subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Good lord...three months.
[4:34:01] <Run44forrest> end spoilers...... the games over no?
[4:34:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> bleedpurple500 bonus50 It wasn't for nothing. It was Jack and Caine having a giggle while their keikaku destroys the bullshit faction and shakes things up, while a lowly Pawn with a raw deal becomes a super-powered freak-beast.
[4:34:06] <%AncelDeLambert> @SnaKemuho is that real? Can I be shown that?
[4:34:06] <Eepravenous> just dont spoil Paige
[4:34:10] <NocturnalRites> Isnt the Kuei Jin ending different?
[4:34:11] <Eepravenous> though pat probably is as we speak
[4:34:16] <Monkeyweed21> i get to say IBO is better written then game of thrones AND vtm bludlines now
[4:34:17] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't Paige asleep?
[4:34:26] <Run44forrest> no
[4:34:27] <SnaKemuho> @anceldelambert search on YouTube or maybe Pat will watch it now
[4:34:27] <%GabeSweetMan> IBO?

[4:36:08] <Run44forrest> what if paiges already a vampire :0
[4:36:11] <Monkeyweed21> @alphonseisbest i get the point it's just really akward and poorly paced

[4:43:36] <%weissguard> LUL LUL LUL
[4:43:36] <MasterDecoder> Because Holy
[4:43:39] <%rdark_ksu> Belief = Power
[4:43:39] <%TheKekromancer> 10 dots true faith can strit up cure vampires
[4:43:40] <+bear_breaker20> So Vampires are just nonbeleivers
[4:43:42] <therakishsage> It's because of TRUE FAITH.
[4:43:42] <%ssjklyco> You can then litterally kill a vampire with friendship
[4:43:42] <Eepravenous> faith = power
[4:43:43] <+SolverCODO> It's like American Gods
[4:43:43] <alrobot2014> the power of faith is stronk
[4:43:43] <jonathandemel> Because FUCK YOU
[4:43:44] <EuropantLamprey> 12 inch is about 30 cm
[4:43:44] <%SeveredWing> anything you have faith in is like vampire repellant
[4:43:46] <%AncelDeLambert> why WOULD that beat a vampire?
[4:43:46] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat FAITH is what works, NOT God specifically
[4:43:47] <NocturnalRites> True Faith is some weird shit
[4:43:49] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat Vampires lose to faith. It hurts them
[4:43:50] <%SolidusRex> Faith = Power
[4:43:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Good job pat
[4:43:52] <+PenmanLupine> Because Faith=Holy energy even if its faith in money
[4:43:57] <%AncelDeLambert> how is faith the antithesis of vampirism?
[4:43:58] <Sokumotanaka> wait so that guy with the card is a warhammer ork?
[4:44:02] <fairore> holy money
[4:44:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> So what you're saying is that Pockets' natural aura would destroy all vampires
[4:44:07] <+dougrayman> the cube :O
[4:44:10] <%thackattack00> Skyrim ResidentSleeper
[4:44:13] <bonzosan> True Faith makes your bible float, and vampires hate it
[4:44:17] <%CrackedPipe457> It's your belief in a thing, not a vampire's
[4:44:19] <%krispen_wa> Yes Man Skyrim Ending!
[4:44:20] <InugamiTheHound> correct choice
[4:44:21] <Ion_Laser> @AncelDeLambert I guess faith in a higher power to smite evil

Vampire actually obliges, but when the Rabbi starts to test holy symbols on him, he starts to have a crisis of faith when he reacts to the crucifix. The vampire just reacted to fuck with him.
