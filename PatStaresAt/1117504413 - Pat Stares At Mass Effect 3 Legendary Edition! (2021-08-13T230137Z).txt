[0:06:01] <%Saffry_Ruzin> I wish Andromeda kept the brutal shit you can do in 3
[0:06:02] <%cvp5127> spoilers therws a robot in eva
[0:06:05] <Madinki> Remember when this was supposed to be the Outro?
[0:06:10] <knight_verse> eww Eva.
[0:06:11] <%Ziegsy> Having never seen an EVA thing in my life, I always assume people are talking about the foam
[0:06:16] <$StrawberryPantsu> Shinji may or may not get in the robot
[0:06:18] <@SoFarFetched> yeah thats fair
[0:06:18] <ScreamLord> The Pat Mech kinda reminds me of that Vital Suits from Lost Planet. The main one
[0:06:20] <@SoFarFetched> with the EVA foam

[0:06:41] <%peachy996> True Andromeda took out a lot of the crunchy part of combat in favor of mobility and jumping
[0:06:41] <Vantesla> @mistymntns No need to worry about any EVA spoiler from me. Given 3.0 killed my interest. As the creator wanted LUL
[0:06:41] <GuyverTypeL> Paige doesn't sound good, is she all right?

[0:07:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> But why?
[0:07:47] <%Saffry_Ruzin> Yeah, people always praise Andromeda's gameplay, but I always preferred 3 and 2's way more
[0:07:55] <DianaTheAscian> Patsatresat disarmament
[0:07:56] <+Gamblor69> Eva is good
[0:07:58] <%king_wragles> @KeiganOfAstora he just TOLD you

[0:07:59] <%psidefx> He got PREMOTED TO VIEWER
[0:07:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh no, I was telling people not to spoil shit dude
[0:08:00] <+kewlmyc> It's already out, when you watching it?
[0:08:01] <%Raiden_Breaker> all of the rebuild stuff is on prime video and the og series is on Netflix
[0:08:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm with you man
[0:08:03] <%Ziegsy> was paige de-modded too?
[0:08:05] <%Agami23> zangief looks so chonk
[0:08:05] <%dawarw0lf> How long is the wait for the dub on EVA
[0:08:06] <@tizz86> i haven't watched 3.33 yet
[0:08:06] <%Xevtes> Xevtes subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Here's a sub! can't wait for your Pasta Rat vtuber debut jk. Thanks for all the great laughs and good times. also hi Paige
[0:08:08] <+BigbysOffice> can you tell plague to stream
[0:08:11] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt How's your MHS2 and Great Ace Attorney playthroughs going?
[0:08:11] <%JoshManVGH> Watching it now.... I don't even know how to spoile it.
[0:08:13] <@commanderclaw> It's been out for 1 day, I will also come to your house and shit in your bathtub if you spoil Evangelion
[0:08:17] <%Arek_1> atpLaw atpWind
[0:08:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> the "but why" was in response to something else
[0:08:18] <%cvp5127> spoilers shinji and kaoru fuck
[0:08:22] <%NopeBadguy> OH SHIT IT'S FRIDAY THE 13TH
[0:08:22] <GustauveVIII> nepotism too much?
[0:08:22] <+vaderxyz1970> Where were you all in the Mod Civil War?
[0:08:26] <mikeriffic> best part of Adromeda is the movement speed but the power usage is simpler then 1-3 so its also worse while being better?
[0:08:27] <%SovPho> fine you?
[0:08:31] <28moogles> Andromeda's combat is good. Shame half of the game is spent driving a bad vehicle around boring fields.
[0:08:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> I might watch it tomorrow
[0:08:34] <%mads_valentine> Are the rebuild movies worth watching? I've only seen the original series and EOE.
[0:08:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wait is Evangelion still ongoing? I thought it was from like 20 years ago?
[0:08:35] <@SoFarFetched> @KeiganOfAstora no it was when you said "3.0 +1.0 spoils?" Cause I recently saw the movie and well geefAwk
[0:08:36] <@MistyMntns> All the mods will legit find you and kill you if you SPOIL THINGS GOD DAMN
[0:08:36] <%NopeBadguy> Yo, I started RingFit back up and I'm in pain
[0:08:38] <%Agami23> i watched some cool horror videos on the youtubes
[0:08:40] <devanmuse> Is the new EVA movie able to be streamed in Canadaland?
[0:08:45] <i_chevalier> she is fiance,  she is the ultimate moderator
[0:08:48] <KaiserMario> Hey Pat, did you get the captain crunch and the giant vat of butterscotch pudding for your wedding yet?
[0:08:49] <viewtifulr> eva the deconstruction? How bout they construct some bihces
[0:08:51] <%JoshManVGH> Been watching all of Rebuild of Evangelion in one sitting... my head is in a weird space...
[0:08:52] <%Scevda> What happened with the modding?
[0:08:55] <%Saffry_Ruzin> I just don't like how Andromeda feels, it's objectively better, but I hate it
[0:08:55] <@goose_attack_almanac> jesus I forgot I was given power
[0:09:01] <%peachy996> I do not care about the evangelions anyway. Unless there's some ShinjiKaworu banging somehow
[0:09:03] <@MistyMntns> @PatStaresAt THis is me all the time.
[0:09:03] <%Ziegsy> My favorite EVA character is Evan.
[0:09:05] <%dawarw0lf> I still need to watch all the rebuild movies
[0:09:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm confused now. Also very stoned. I'll cool guys, I swear
[0:09:07] <Parapattern> Does the new EVA advertise KFC to me?
[0:09:13] <GuyverTypeL> KILLER GOOSE
[0:09:19] <@SoFarFetched> @goose_attack_almanac now you need to play MIGHTY GOOSE
[0:09:23] <knight_verse> Good thing I don't care for EVA.
[0:09:28] <%peachy996> My favorite character from Evangelion is the orange juice
[0:09:28] <@commanderclaw> I've been rewatching all of Eva in preparation for this, please no spoil
[0:09:29] <DianaTheAscian> I HOPE IT DOES
[0:09:31] <%AmericanSkidd> I just woke from a two hour nap so I can try and fix my sleep schedule
[0:09:34] <@SoFarFetched> I saw the movie 12 hours ago so I can find the spoilers geefPoint
[0:09:36] <@tizz86> i do have a bunch of airline points just sitting around... just saying lol
[0:09:37] <%NopeBadguy> The fuck
[0:09:40] <anAngryHamster> I've seen so many EVA spoilers and they're so crazy I can't even understand without context
[0:09:41] <Nightwolf656> That shit was so confusing
[0:09:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Remember Pizza Hut in Code Geass?
[0:09:48] <%Agami23> theres some weird advertizements for eva.
[0:09:54] <%Arweynn> remember the creepy gendo shaving ad
[0:09:55] <+Gamblor69> I finished the film about an hour ago
[0:09:56] <%NopeBadguy> RingFit made me sore today so now I'm just chilling with the stream
[0:09:56] <@MistyMntns> I watched like the first 10 minutes and I went, I should watch the first two movies.
[0:10:03] <%ShawnTK_> @SoFarFetched But that also means you have the power to spoil
[0:10:06] <Nightwolf656> Shut up... are you for real Baller?
[0:10:06] <%Agami23> like the evangellion wedding rings that came out a while ago. which was cool
[0:10:07] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat Is there a Canadian KFC equivalent?
[0:10:08] <%Saffry_Ruzin> If I had to choose between Andromeda and 3's gameplay, I'd pick 3's dated gameplay Everytime just because it feels right and the cover system isn't straight out of Dead Space 3 like Andromeda's
[0:10:12] <+GuilKato> Gilette razor with Gendo finally shaving from Eva was a wtf advert
[0:10:13] <DianaTheAscian> The new Gundam movie has a product placement as well
[0:10:15] <%peachy996> Nothing in Evangelion will top EoE's "And then the Tang happened"
[0:10:17] <%Solid_Stro> I saw a Boss Coffee with Gendo on it and I drank it sabert14Sip
[0:10:24] <ExpressNode> QFC
[0:10:27] <@SoFarFetched> @ShawnTK_ Im not an asshole. And if I spoiled when pat's literally watching chat that would be stupid.
[0:10:27] <stantheman_97> oh god i somehow keep forgetting about pizza hut and code geass
[0:10:28] <Vantesla> @mads_valentine Yes and no. First one is pretty much a very well polished and very slight difference to say first half. Second goes into a definite new direction, 3 either people stook around or said F it as again it was designed to make people f off LUL
[0:10:30] <$StrawberryPantsu> REKT
[0:10:31] <%Monkeyweed21> my favorite part of 3.0+1.0 was when Gendo shaved his beard and got super happy
[0:10:31] <@tizz86> KFP

[0:12:30] <$StrawberryPantsu> Popeye once got his ass beat in a dream by Bluto, then he woke up and whopped his as IRL.
[0:12:31] <knight_verse> Not my favorite type of robot.
[0:12:34] <%James_Quivers> Eva is just Gurren Lagann but worse
[0:12:34] <GamerWorlock> Thats me rite now
[0:12:36] <i_chevalier> Yes, but I just watched bad gundam
[0:12:36] <@commanderclaw> Have you ever wanted to be emotionally scarred and then listen to "Fly me to the Moon"?
[0:12:39] <%peachy996> I sadly missed the boat on Evangelion. Saw Blue Gender
[0:12:39] <mikeriffic> ITS AN ANGERUUUU!
[0:12:41] <%JoshManVGH> Eva, parental abandonment, the anime
[0:12:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I have enough depression dont need more
[0:12:43] <%peachy996> Hey Blue Gender sucks
[0:12:46] <%Agami23> cat tail
[0:12:47] <%Xevtes> sounds like a bummer
[0:12:47] <%dawarw0lf> Eva looks so good till this day. It doesn’t look outdated compared to other anime at the time
[0:12:47] <+Gamblor69> Im ok with dad, but defo bad with women
[0:12:48] <%NopeBadguy> IS THAT AN ELMO TAIL
[0:12:50] <GustauveVIII> remember that time when shinji masturbated over the body of a comatose girl in end of evangelion
[0:12:50] <stantheman_97> yeah i watched eva as a depressed loner 14 year old so i was the PERFECT audience for it
[0:12:50] <%peachy996> Come at me Blue Gender fans
[0:12:50] <AthenaAegis> Elmo tail
[0:12:51] <%Scevda> Some mother issues may apply
[0:12:51] <%Dakuu75> Did Pat not stream the past few days or am I crazy?
[0:12:53] <SaltyAzteca> @cvp5127 I cant believe it. I am the shocked.
[0:12:53] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I only watch the anime but remenber very little of it
[0:12:53] <GuyverTypeL> @sofarfetched kuruch1Heart kuruch1Heart
[0:12:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:12:55] <DianaTheAscian> only yes to 1 of those things
[0:12:57] <santafer> what about trauma?
[0:12:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea sounds about right
[0:12:57] <%Solid_Stro> Daddy Issues, Puberty, Robots
[0:12:59] <%JehutyVer2> Pen Pen is the real draw
[0:13:00] <%UvBenServed> psaElmo
[0:13:00] <Vantesla> The creator of EVA practically hates his creation due to crazed fans and his bosses demanding more EVA....
[0:13:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Clip that
[0:13:01] <+vaderxyz1970> You ever been horny but depressed?
[0:13:04] <%Meekest> @PatStaresAt should i watch Gundam before Eva
[0:13:05] <Madinki> So don’t watch it got it
[0:13:06] <%Saffry_Ruzin> I like how 3 doesn't have hacking puzzles, but it still has auto bypassing where Shepard fails 1-3 times so the game can load
[0:13:07] <devanmuse> Do you have a frankly unhealthy desire to swim in an ocean of Orange Tang? Watch EVA
[0:13:08] <%Dakuu75> <3
[0:13:08] <%MagnusXP> @commanderclaw Ah understood.
[0:13:14] <knight_verse> I don't find any of the girls in EVA interesting at all.
[0:13:19] <anAngryHamster> EVA was more appealing when it was railing against the crowded mecha genre
[0:13:19] <+kewlmyc> ?
[0:13:20] <tanarath> bork
[0:13:20] <@SoFarFetched> @Meekest Gundam it REALLY depends where you start on.
[0:13:21] <%NopeBadguy> How're your MHS2 and Great Ace Attorney playthroughs going?
[0:13:22] <Dunmarkh> fuck no
[0:13:22] <%Dakuu75> y... yes?
[0:13:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> noooooooooooooooooooooooo
[0:13:27] <@SoFarFetched> I'LL WATCH IT WITH YOU GUYS AGAIN
[0:13:31] <DianaTheAscian> Oh its done done done?
[0:13:31] <%Raiden_Breaker> Shinji has to catch a train while wearing headphones
[0:13:32] <%Mr___Pillow> talking about all Eva four movies being on Prime Video?
[0:13:32] <+D00msDayDan> until they want more money
[0:13:32] <%cvp5127> sure
[0:13:33] <stantheman_97> do you love CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS
[0:13:36] <@ssjklyco> I don't beleive that
[0:13:36] <%dawarw0lf> But actually not
[0:13:37] <@Lion_kun> Can't you ignore the movies?
[0:13:39] <%watts121> Until we want more money.
[0:13:40] <GamerWorlock> You ever gonna get back on Gundam?
[0:13:41] <%Solid_Stro> Yes I’ve watched Wisecrack too sabert14Box
[0:13:43] <@commanderclaw> Anno can't make his fucking mind up
[0:13:45] <i_chevalier> lol
[0:13:45] <%Dakuu75> See you space cowboy~
[0:13:50] <%Monkeyweed21> PAIGE IS GONNA LEARN WHY PAT MARRIED HER
[0:13:52] <tanarath> UNTIL ANO NEEDS $
[0:13:55] <@SoFarFetched> Movies,Manga,and anime are THREEE DIFFERENT THINGS
[0:13:55] <%peachy996> Money, the great Lazarus device of fiction
[0:13:56] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Anno's got that Godzilla money doesnt he
[0:13:58] <+dd44dostivei> see you space cowboy
[0:13:58] <+D00msDayDan> i've gone my whole life ignoring evangelion and look how i turned out
[0:13:59] <%JoshManVGH> The first movies probably
[0:14:02] <@SoFarFetched> THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN DIFFERENCES
[0:14:02] <28moogles> No it's not?
[0:14:03] <@commanderclaw> I need to read the Manga
[0:14:04] <%Ynkubus_> Eh, Anno is doing Shin Ultraman and Kamen Rider so it'll be a while
[0:14:04] <%PhantomMiG> It is my theory that any add only works in the country that made it. My time in the u.k as an american I saw soon madness like the kid who wants to fuck his friends mom in an Irn-Bru Ad
[0:14:05] <%peachy996> Everybody LOVES money.
[0:14:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> But the movies are so cool
[0:14:06] <oda_flobunaga> Disney Sure did
[0:14:08] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> What's the viewing order?
[0:14:09] <@Lion_kun> I thought the movies were a reboot not a sequel.
[0:14:09] <%Scevda> Damnit
[0:14:10] <JunkyardCrow> I know I do
[0:14:12] <@SoFarFetched> But they like share similarities
[0:14:13] <Thrashcrow> Anno just wants to make Kamen Rider in peace
[0:14:13] <%JoshManVGH> But rebuild is all movies
[0:14:14] <+GuilKato> everything is cannon even the ps2 japan only game
[0:14:14] <%Ziegsy> He need that canned bread monies
[0:14:14] <i_chevalier> @dakuu75 ah man. that still hurts. I miss cowboy bebop
[0:14:17] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt but Return of the Jedi isn't that good
[0:14:19] <@tizz86> there's one after 3.33? I'm outta the loop since 2.22
[0:14:19] <+DracosMagala> Hello HeyGuys
[0:14:21] <$StrawberryPantsu> Release order
[0:14:23] <Talhee> I honestly could not care less about it after the last 2 disasters.
[0:14:25] <@ssjklyco> I honestly don't know either
[0:14:28] <%AmericanSkidd> its a meme
[0:14:32] <%SaiyanShoto> We'll have to deal with people overanalyzing the eva movie for a good few months
[0:14:32] <Conscript_Gary> You can ignore the first two recap movies but not the rebuilds
[0:14:33] <Vantesla> Anno was rushed and made 3.0 purposely bad. But yet many people take it as some deeper meaning LUL
[0:14:34] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Isn't some of the Movies just Recaps?
[0:14:37] <%Dakuu75> @i_chevalier doodShake
[0:14:40] <%Scevda> Nope
[0:14:40] <@SoFarFetched> I can't explain anything with new knowledge from the movie.
[0:14:42] <%Monkeyweed21> start with 2.22
[0:14:43] <+unhuggable1> then u stop
[0:14:43] <%peachy996> I miss Cowboy Bebop but I'm glad it will never get a sequel series like FLCL did.
[0:14:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BRUH
[0:14:44] <%dawarw0lf> Then 10 right
[0:14:44] <oda_flobunaga> then you stop watching
[0:14:45] <+D00msDayDan> you've lost me
[0:14:45] <%AmericanSkidd> its the meme of the week on the subreddit
[0:14:47] <%Raiden_Breaker> is this the pat order lol
[0:14:47] <+GuilKato> Series - then Death and Rebirth, then End of Evangelion, then the Rebuilds
[0:14:48] <stantheman_97> i hear that new movie is real good actually
[0:14:49] <%UvBenServed> Woah woah, let me write this down
[0:14:49] <@Lion_kun> I've only watched the original Eva and EoE.
[0:14:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> 1-26
[0:15:00] <DianaTheAscian> Is it true the Manga is required reading? @PatStaresAt
[0:15:03] <%JoshManVGH> @tizz86 3.0 - 1.0 came out today on Amazon Prime. It's a ride
[0:15:04] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt What about the manga?
[0:15:05] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[0:15:05] <+kewlmyc> 1-26, EoE, then the Rebuilds. Death and Rebirth isn't really necessary.
[0:15:06] <%NopeBadguy> Are you gonna check out the FF PIxel Remasters? @PatStaresAt
[0:15:07] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> theres EOE and rebuild and shit
[0:15:07] <@SoFarFetched> @OfficioPrefectusCorgi old movies were recaps,then EoE. Then we got the new Studio Khara that does the old series but new changes.
[0:15:09] <%Interface23> Interface23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:15:12] <%Hitman0257> woah slow down I need to write this down
[0:15:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Netflix is fine too
[0:15:17] <%dawarw0lf> Dub or sub tho?
[0:15:18] <%JohnAtDawn> You watch rebuild 1 and 2 and then read fan fiction.
[0:15:18] <%Dakuu75> which one censors shinji being a sex offender?
[0:15:20] <%Mr___Pillow> thx @tixx86 for the free sub psaDogchamp
[0:15:24] <%JehutyVer2> then stop
[0:15:27] <JunkyardCrow> 1-24 and then EoE then you're done.
[0:15:27] <%peachy996> Orange Juice
[0:15:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Death'
[0:15:31] <@Jekado> do i have to play a Neir game to learn the true ending?  Is there some weird cross over i assume.
[0:15:32] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> @SoFarFetched Thx
[0:15:32] <%Caped_Eggy> Yea, no
[0:15:32] <@tizz86> @joshmanvgh ah, I have 1.11 and 2.22 on BD
[0:15:34] <GustauveVIII> evangelion is literally just one man's spiral into tax evasive depression
[0:15:36] <Vantesla> @dakuu75 EoE
[0:15:38] <@MistyMntns> That is a Movie title
[0:15:40] <%toastybites> this is some kingdom hearts shit
[0:15:40] <%Agami23> i fucking love that title
[0:15:40] <@Lion_kun> This is worse than Kingdom Hearts
[0:15:41] <%Dakuu75> that last one sounded so made upo
[0:15:42] <+GuilKato> Pat what about Death and Rebirth!
[0:15:43] <+kewlmyc> 3.33 is so fucking bad
[0:15:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's it
[0:15:45] <GuyverTypeL> off that naming
[0:15:45] <%Ziegsy> K-kingdom hearts
[0:15:46] <@SoFarFetched> @GustauveVIII Its about Yoshi? PogChamp
[0:15:46] <%AmericanSkidd> kingdom hearts got it
[0:15:47] <mikeriffic> IT makes sense IF YOU DONT THINK ABOUT IT
[0:15:50] <$StrawberryPantsu> Rebuilds are optional
[0:15:52] <%SaiyanShoto> Thats super simple
[0:15:52] <knight_verse> The boring incest clone, the bitchy redhead, the older girl that never had a chance and the OC... yeah, no thanks.
[0:15:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Thrice upon a time is nuts
[0:15:54] <SaltyAzteca> and then you cry
[0:15:54] <%Meekest> But what order to I read Jojo
[0:15:54] <%Deano8817> it's so much easier then kingdom hearts
[0:15:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> as a title
[0:15:57] <%Agami23> you do the same for kingdom hearts
[0:15:57] <digaogrunge> So... in release orde?
[0:15:58] <DianaTheAscian> I watched all of UC Gundam this should be easy
[0:16:02] <%Scevda> Wtf is that last title
[0:16:05] <mikeriffic> Rebirth is just a recap though isnt it?
[0:16:07] <%charp35> Literally just watch in order
[0:16:07] <@commanderclaw> No, rebuilds are *not* optional
[0:16:07] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU DO THAT WITH KINGDOM HEARTS TOO
[0:16:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Why do i hate everytning you just said
[0:16:08] <@SoFarFetched> @Lion_kun kingdom hearts was worse to deal with cause different games on different platforms LUL EVA is all one media
[0:16:09] <digaogrunge> NO
[0:16:10] <@ssjklyco> Eva wasn't on different media that required different hardware
[0:16:10] <%peachy996> @PatStaresAt Hey what are your thoughts on Blue Gender, sucks or not sucks?
[0:16:11] <%SaiyanShoto> The rebuilds were optional at first but not anymore
[0:16:11] <JunkyardCrow> Where does 'Girlfriend of Steel' factor in? Kappa
[0:16:16] <%JoshManVGH> Rebuilds are.... important for reasons.
[0:16:17] <@commanderclaw> You can (Not) Skip Rebuild
[0:16:17] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Not anymore
[0:16:18] <KaiserMario> Isn't that true for KH too? Just play i the order they cameout?
[0:16:18] <%JehutyVer2> everything's optional Kappa
[0:16:22] <%Raiden_Breaker> its kinda the goal at this point to catch up with modern takes of the media
[0:16:26] <Nightwolf656> Its just the Titles that are fucky and make most newcomers confused
[0:16:28] <digaogrunge> REBUILD IS INTEGRAL
[0:16:31] <linSP> (No)
[0:16:32] <@commanderclaw> "The last book is optional"
[0:16:33] <%Solid_Stro> Numbers are easier to understand then complete nonsensical subtitles
[0:16:40] <%Agami23> obviously the ps1 game of evangellion where rei is your tamagachi is needed
[0:16:44] <oda_flobunaga> Where does a God Warrior Descends on Tokyo fit in?
[0:16:45] <28moogles> No it's not. lol
[0:16:49] <Tracazoid> You could make End of Evangelion optional if you want, End of TV is pretty good
[0:16:49] <%AmericanSkidd> now imagine Shinji instead of Sora and how fucked Kingdom Hearts becomes
[0:16:51] <blue8moon> I mean, it's all optional, it's an anime LUL
[0:16:52] <@goose_attack_almanac> It's optional for George
[0:16:53] <@SoFarFetched> "Hey Im gonna play KH 2 now" "WAIT I WAS SUPPOSED TO PLAY THE GBA GAME TO UNDERSTAND THINGS!?"
[0:16:53] <@MistyMntns> I'm just gonna watch the movies because my attention span is not great
[0:16:57] <%dooscent> anything is optional, if you believe in yourself
[0:16:57] <+goblinking92> Dead Space 3 is optional
[0:16:58] <$Futurecity10> movies only matter if you started watching the movies
[0:17:05] <28moogles> The story of the show ends with End of Eva. Rebuild is it's own thing.
[0:17:05] <%Saffry_Ruzin> The final Game of Thrones book is optional because it'll never come out
[0:17:11] <@commanderclaw> 3.33 is fucking weird
[0:17:12] <%mads_valentine> The story is complete at End of Eva.
[0:17:13] <%Xevtes> @goblinking92 yea it is
[0:17:14] <%dawarw0lf> I need to watch the movies pronto
[0:17:15] <williamrooster> dose rebuild take place after eoe?
[0:17:15] <generalve> @patstaresat  you really should bring Javik for the sur kesh mission for some funny dialogue
[0:17:16] <GuyverTypeL> @goblinking92 Always was
[0:17:22] <%peachy996> EoE is a great stopping point if you desire pain
[0:17:23] <%SaiyanShoto> One complaint I've seen someone say about Eva is that in the show Shinji never goes through an arc, he stays the same throughout the show
[0:17:23] <%JoshManVGH> Evangelion Rebuild ***: You Can (Not) Skip
[0:17:24] <%Hitman0257> rebulids are sequel correct I have watched them and can't tell
[0:17:25] <%Monkeyweed21> the extended ending of AOT is unfortunately not optional
[0:17:26] <%Scevda> Is Rebuils the new normal Pat?
[0:17:26] <%JohnAtDawn> 1 and 2 are great
[0:17:27] <Latija> are the rebuilds even canon?
[0:17:30] <+GuilKato> death and rebirth is mostly a recap - but does have some content not in the base 01-26 episodes
[0:17:30] <stantheman_97> 3 is visually great and the music is fucking phenomenal
[0:17:31] <dekkitout> Bad attention span? GOOD LUCK
[0:17:32] <+vaderxyz1970> Whats GOT? Im missing like 8 years of my life for some reason
[0:17:33] <@Lion_kun> Aren't the rebuilds, just a retelling of 1-26?
[0:17:33] <%cvp5127> spoilers shinji bust a nut
[0:17:34] <Vantesla> Anno literally kept making to spite people LUL Mind more complicated as he had depression and to many crazed fans. Rebuild is and isn't it own thing. first two good then 3 is when Anno said F it I'm sick off it again.
[0:17:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Then maybe this isn't the series for you
[0:17:46] <$antibonehurtingjuice> Oh boy I cant wait to watch my favorite turret hugger play my favorite game
[0:17:46] <@MistyMntns> uuughhhhhhh fine
[0:17:48] <$StrawberryPantsu> Death and Rebirth->End of Evangeloion->Rebuilds
[0:17:48] <Profmcstevie> Turn away from EVA period if attention span is an issue
[0:17:51] <%peachy996> Always consider stopping at EoE and then make that decision yourself if you want to continue from there
[0:17:54] <Talhee> @PatStaresAt Berserk died in my soul 15 years ago, Eva for me finished just as long ago.
[0:17:54] <@MistyMntns> I have nothing better to do this weekend.
[0:17:56] <%metalsiren31> I've watched everything and the third movie is STILL an uncomprehensible mess
[0:17:57] <%SaiyanShoto> just watch the cum part
[0:17:57] <@MistyMntns> Guess i'll binge it
[0:17:59] <%InternetShis> Hey Pat, I know you'll still be talking to money givers by the time I end my break, but yeah colonize that xenophilic qussy and make the stupid frog woman mad
[0:18:01] <@SoFarFetched> @Lion_kun No because shit changes.
[0:18:01] <dekkitout> @Latija They're all canon, the manga, lite novels, anime, the shaving commercial, it's all canon
[0:18:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Watch the original series, it's worth it
[0:18:08] <%Treasure_Vault> Has Pat talked about the 7 hour RE retrospective yet?
[0:18:11] <$StrawberryPantsu> OH YEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:18:18] <marvel877> Anyone know where I can find the old dub of EVA?
[0:18:22] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat He is something that will probably get me a lot of hate, but I don't star wars as a series isn't very good. Rogue One, and Mando were good, but that's cause they didn't have jedi.
[0:18:23] <@SoFarFetched> Its why I say the Anime,the Manga,and the new Movie series are 3 different things. But they share some similiar details.
[0:18:23] <%Scevda> Is Rebuild the new normal?
[0:18:27] <%metalsiren31> That's the BEST SHOT
[0:18:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh yeah no thanks
[0:18:27] <%Solid_Stro> Oh that elevator
[0:18:28] <%JoshManVGH> The hospital room that's blindingly bright. ..
[0:18:28] <dekkitout> The second half of the 4TH movie is UBER DENSE
[0:18:28] <marvel877> The elevator.
[0:18:28] <%dudeitsray> should I watch it at 1.75x then?
[0:18:29] <%Mr___Pillow> general rule for OG anime is to skip ep. 23 onward due to the behind the scenes budget going out the window with absurd meta commentay for 4 or 5 episodes and go to End of Eva iirc
[0:18:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat, that happens once
[0:18:31] <+Mage_Doug> Hope you like elevators
[0:18:31] <%peachy996> But hey Congratulations
[0:18:31] <%AmericanSkidd> congratulations
[0:18:32] <DianaTheAscian> HOLD FOR TIME
[0:18:33] <linSP> I remembered being left off before end of eva was a thing
[0:18:35] <jbrachob> elevator scenes mother fuckers
[0:18:36] <KaiserMario> Gotta save as much as possibler
[0:18:36] <%Mr_Pylon> Hell yeah hanging budget shot
[0:18:37] <@ssjklyco> Just like modern anime
[0:18:38] <Vantesla> EVA demands you attention. Even if it isn't as deep many people make it out to be LUL
[0:18:39] <SaltyAzteca> OH THAT SHOT
[0:18:40] <knight_verse> Translation: "It's boring AF."
[0:18:40] <%Monkeyweed21> BOY DID THEY
[0:18:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> That elevator scene is a rare occurance
[0:18:43] <stantheman_97> GAINAX MONEY PROBLEMS BABY
[0:18:48] <blue8moon> elevator
[0:18:50] <%Agami23> the elevator shot is so iconic
[0:18:51] <+D00msDayDan> @i_chevalier genndy's clone wars is the only good star wars i'll die on this hill for free
[0:18:52] <@SoFarFetched> when's extended elevator shot
[0:18:52] <%peachy996> SQUAWK SQUAWK (Congratulations!)
[0:18:55] <%maenos2> elevator shot with Carl from athf
[0:18:55] <%dooscent> did you ever see the elevator shot with Carl from Aqua Teen goin "it don't matter... none of this matters
[0:18:55] <%Monkeyweed21> THE ORIGINAL ENDING WAS LIKE A SHITSHOW BEFORE EoE
[0:18:55] <digaogrunge> LOVE ANNO
[0:18:55] <@ssjklyco> Speed run of elevator shot
[0:18:55] <Madinki> (Askua flips her hair) WOW
[0:18:58] <Parapattern> Especially when Carl is in the mix
[0:19:02] <@MistyMntns> Man I just got called out Okay
[0:19:04] <%Hitman0257> its not boring it takes its time
[0:19:04] <jbrachob> Is WAY too real
[0:19:06] <%Scevda> Is it pixelated hand holding?
[0:19:06] <@goose_attack_almanac> It's a relatable scene
[0:19:06] <dekkitout> "Ya gotta say which floor you want- 11!"
[0:19:08] <%SovPho> my cousin just told me she uses bobby pins to clean her ears instead of q tips, which are already bad
[0:19:10] <%SaiyanShoto> No you don't understand! They didn't run out of money! It's high art! Kappa
[0:19:12] <Vantesla> Elevator shot redux three or four times I believe now...
[0:19:12] <Tracazoid> Were you Asuka or Rei?
[0:19:15] <viewtifulr> not the hospital bed hand bed one?
[0:19:15] <%dawarw0lf> I watched EVA three years ago ish and I loved it. I thought it was overhyped garbage
[0:19:15] <$KnivesEve> my favorite scene is that elevator shot with carl from aqua tenn
[0:19:15] <%peachy996> I fucking love that Pen Pen gets in that scene, it's so goofy lol
[0:19:19] <stantheman_97> the elevator scene is the only one of those i like
[0:19:26] <%Mage_Doug> Mage_Doug subscribed with Prime. 
[0:19:31] <DianaTheAscian> so 200 years ago?
[0:19:32] <+dukeofhammer> I dont know anything about Evangelion except for the elevator shot.
[0:19:33] <knight_verse> The only good thing out of EVA are the memes.
[0:19:33] <@SoFarFetched> back when it aired on KQED
[0:19:35] <@ssjklyco> 2003 I think
[0:19:36] <marvel877> And then Xenogears did the same thing EVA did with the second disc.
[0:19:37] <i_chevalier> @d00msdaydan I salute your bravery good sir! ExtraLife
[0:19:37] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt But did you read the manga? And should I read it? LUL
[0:19:37] <SaltyAzteca> my favourite shot is that shot. You know the shot.
[0:19:37] <@commanderclaw> You mean the most psychologically damaging time?
[0:19:38] <Madinki> @Tracazoid Were you crazy or a doll?
[0:19:40] <digaogrunge> 97?
[0:19:46] <%JoshManVGH> 2000 ish?
[0:19:47] <%dawarw0lf> My brother still thinks it’s overhyped garbage
[0:19:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Toonami
[0:19:48] <%AmericanSkidd> when you could imagine banging asuka and not be a huge creepo
[0:19:48] <Vantesla> Gah.
[0:20:01] <%Agami23> i watched evangellion on tv when i was a child. that was a bad idea it fucked me up!
[0:20:03] <@MistyMntns> @PatStaresAt  Novemeber 1997
[0:20:03] <@SoFarFetched> think I was 8 when it came out on TV geefThink
[0:20:04] <blue8moon> I think I was too young for that show, and I didn't watch it when it first aired in the us LUL
[0:20:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> It originally came out in 1993 or so?
[0:20:07] <%DEETRz> DEETRz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[0:20:09] <%xcompleasedad> I was born in 97. Jesus
[0:20:10] <%vonepic> I’ve never seen evangelion outside a clip on YouTube called “Shinji the homophobe”. I think I got the jist of it
[0:20:12] <$StrawberryPantsu> Last year bro
[0:20:14] <$StrawberryPantsu> :kappa
[0:20:15] <dekkitout> Where was the "wall" at in the original series, episode 16, 19?
[0:20:17] <linSP> you think Eva fucked up some kids childhoods
[0:20:23] <$antibonehurtingjuice> I wasn't even alive lol
[0:20:24] <%peachy996> I once played Komm Susser Tod at the end of a playthrough in ME3. It's very effective
[0:20:24] <knight_verse> @americanskidd Well, he has his own mixed with some fucked up dna Rei in her.
[0:20:25] <%Monkeyweed21> there's a manga series where the release date of EVA is a major plot point
[0:20:28] <%SaiyanShoto> I was 6 years old at that time
[0:20:35] <%peachy996> Great song. Wow it hurts
[0:20:36] <%maenos2> YAY SHOUT OUT TO 86 GET FUCKED OTNER YEARS
[0:20:36] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I watched the first episode but dropped it afterwards
[0:20:37] <Vantesla> I recall in 98 toys in the old style GameStop stores. with bootleg VHS tapes.
[0:20:38] <stantheman_97> i was a baby
[0:20:38] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I saw it in the Philippines when it came out. I was so weirded out but I kept watching.
[0:20:45] <%Scevda> OLD
[0:20:46] <%NopeBadguy> You're so fucked up\
[0:20:47] <%Hitman0257> MAN 97 IS A HELL OF A YEAR FOR MEDIA
[0:20:47] <%JoshManVGH> Woof
[0:20:49] <%Solid_Stro> I saw Evangelion at a time that I probably shouldn’t have, along with Ninja Scroll. I think it jump started puberty for me. sabert14Sip
[0:20:49] <%baka_sugoi> EGDGEY LORE
[0:20:51] <%Raiden_Breaker> I get that feeling with persona 4
[0:20:52] <%firemage96> the way you make it sound is yeah they ran out of money but they did the most with no money
[0:20:53] <%dawarw0lf> I was 20
[0:20:54] <GuyverTypeL> fuuuuuuck, time is weird man
[0:20:54] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Cruel Angel's Thesis is BOP tho
[0:20:56] <DianaTheAscian> I didn't exist
[0:20:56] <%Fooguwu> Pat watched it when he was "so fucked up"
[0:20:57] <%Mr___Pillow> second coming of anime in the West with the Ghost In the Shell movie as well. Like Akira all three did so much for the medium to get popular
[0:21:00] <@ssjklyco> Get in the robot, Pat
[0:21:01] <$antibonehurtingjuice> @maenos2 thats a weird way to say 98
[0:21:03] <digaogrunge> Im exactly the same age as them
[0:21:12] <%JoshManVGH> That's heavy shit to watch in thr 5th grade
[0:21:14] <rekinom> Watching Eva in your formative years will fick you up
[0:21:14] <dekkitout> Pat woulda made a decent pilot given his goblins
[0:21:16] <%peachy996> Yeah Cruel Angel's Thesis but Fly Me To The Moon though
[0:21:17] <marvel877> I watched it on Adult Swim and recorded EoE with VHS tape off a movie channel late at night. I wish I still had that tape.
[0:21:19] <knight_verse> @dawarw0lf So he is smart?
[0:21:21] <%dooscent> it's been 20 years...
[0:21:22] <$StrawberryPantsu> MISATO
[0:21:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Did you watch it going "That's me! That's me FR!"
[0:21:26] <%andrewofbob> Oh no, I missed the best part of the stream: the pre-game talk
[0:21:26] <Nightwolf656> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis  Wow...I watched this series when i was way younger than i realized
[0:21:26] <%thesickestzak> nliL1 nliL2 nliL3
[0:21:28] <%peachy996> And then someone says Kaworu
[0:21:29] <JunkyardCrow> I saw Eva when I was like 8, probably why I have such fucked up taste now LUL
[0:21:29] <%Scevda> This is the same effect as Harry Potter for many of us. @patstaresat
[0:21:30] <stantheman_97> 20 YEARS

[0:21:34] <%PhantomMiG> It beens 20 year
[0:21:34] <%maenos2> @antibonehurtingjuice man I'm turning 35 next month let me have this before I dissolve into dust T_T
[0:21:35] <%Ynkubus_> And then the Waifu WArs raged eternal
[0:21:35] <%dudeitsray> "thats the thing about these anime girls maaan"
[0:21:36] <Vantesla> I will say 3.0 made a good joke on the aging and fandom LUL
[0:21:38] <%Monkeyweed21> HOW DID SO MANY MISS THE POINT
[0:21:39] <%AmericanSkidd> The Waifu Wars are never OVER
[0:21:39] <@commanderclaw> Misato tho
[0:21:39] <linSP> being slightly younger than the kid protagonist is the best time to consume the anime
[0:21:41] <dekkitout> Outta left field come the Mari degeneracy
[0:21:41] <+D00msDayDan> and that post was in like 2016
[0:21:42] <SaltyAzteca> FOR 20 YEARS
[0:21:43] <dekkitout> Like me
[0:21:46] <stantheman_97> but rei is best
[0:21:47] <%Pappajimbo> so the cycle continues
[0:21:47] <i_chevalier> My very first big mechanic anime was BiG-O
[0:21:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> isnt it almost 30 years now?
[0:21:49] <Talhee> I was the same age as the Persona 4 cast when it came out.
[0:21:49] <@DakotaMacDoodle> My first time watching Eva was catching the ending of the Og Series at like 4 am I was so confused.
[0:21:50] <%Mr_Pylon> god I had roomates who argued about this shit once
[0:21:50] <%demiiluna> EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S ASUKA
[0:21:53] <%Treasure_Vault> I was too old when I watched it. Misato was the only one not a literal child.
[0:21:53] <%Hitman0257> the war is enteral
[0:21:55] <@MistyMntns> Man I dont have the emojis to show my distraught at it
[0:21:57] <$antibonehurtingjuice> @maenos2 the future is now old man
[0:22:00] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Eva seems like a weird series to have Waifu battles in
[0:22:00] <oda_flobunaga> Lucille Ball or Gracie Allen?
[0:22:03] <%peachy996> Kaworu bros just watching the eternal Asuka vs Rei fights
[0:22:03] <%SaiyanShoto> Yeah we all already know Asuka is the best
[0:22:08] <%BigBlackBankai> @king_wragles Thank you handsome stranger.
[0:22:08] <SaltyAzteca> Robots are temporary, waifus are FOREVER
[0:22:09] <%maenos2> @antibonehurtingjuice nooooo
[0:22:10] <%xcompleasedad> Because they were designed in a lab to be fought over.
[0:22:12] <%PhantomMiG> And heres for 20 years more
[0:22:15] <marvel877> Anyone see the RE:Death gagdub of EVA?

[0:23:20] <%Ynkubus_> He's doing Shin UIltraman and Shin Kamen Rider right now, let him have that
[0:23:20] <+vaderxyz1970> Wouldn't a relationship with either Rei or Auska be like the most emotionaly messed up not worth it really relationship?
[0:23:20] <jbrachob> He needs to make another godzilla movie...with Del Toro
[0:23:21] <Vantesla> Anno is free for now is the true statement LUL
[0:23:22] <@Jekado> thats like saying Yoshi P will be free... geefSmugAF
[0:23:23] <%peachy996> I remember lots of Evangelion fans having opinions on 3
[0:23:23] <marvel877> Anno is free till he decides nah, I got more things to say.
[0:23:28] <%dukeofhammer> good name
[0:23:29] <linSP> bring back anno!

[0:24:44] <marvel877> SHUT THE FUCK UP, that's what you say.
[0:24:46] <%Scevda> STFU
[0:24:49] <%Monkeyweed21> Asuka is a toxic bitch that actively exacerbates both Shinji and her's self-loathing, Rei is unsettlingly emotionless and only starts developing self determination right before death, and Misato is a bordline sexual predator that uses sexual teasing as a replacement for actually taking care of Shinji
[0:24:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LAWYER UP
[0:24:53] <%baka_sugoi> OBJECTION
[0:24:53] <Dannzzyy> Shut the fuck up fridays

[0:26:52] <%SaiyanShoto> That's fine it'll be like a new experience
[0:26:56] <28moogles> tbh you were wrong about half of it, no offense.
[0:26:56] <%Fooguwu> the goblins have left but will still call and harass you
[0:26:56] <DianaTheAscian> So it would be perefct then

[0:27:04] <%Treasure_Vault> That's good too though
[0:27:05] <%BigBlackBankai> BACK IN!!!
[0:27:06] <DianaTheAscian> perfect*
[0:27:07] <luftraumm1> let sh2 live  in our memories
[0:27:14] <SaltyAzteca> FIRST TIME
[0:27:14] <%MidnightBurst12> just do more research Kappa
[0:27:19] <blackjack8182> Play Silent Hill 4
[0:27:23] <%dawarw0lf> I hope man
[0:27:23] <%peachy996> KroGuards were great
[0:27:26] <%MagnusXP> That makes it more fun @patstaresat .
[0:27:27] <+ultimafullmetal> That sounds like it would be worth playing without prep then
[0:27:27] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Stream stream stream 🤔
[0:27:35] <%cvp5127> just plagiarize your own work
[0:27:37] <%Ches_Neckbeard> ME3 multiplayer still runs you just have to install the original game
[0:27:37] <+SimplesRock> Yo same
[0:27:39] <%Grimdogx> I don't trust modern Bioware enough to want it
[0:27:39] <Mattais88> I'd rather them unlock romances for any gender
[0:27:49] <%peachy996> Hell Kroguards in Andromeda are wacky nuts (but not as durable)
[0:27:55] <%dawarw0lf> My favorite was the Warlord that should totally have been immune to synckills
[0:28:06] <%maenos2> LUL
[0:28:07] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Pissboy
[0:28:08] <stantheman_97> LUL
[0:28:10] <Aiutare47> @Doug_episodes
[0:28:10] <@goose_attack_almanac> I've been playing the MP off Origin. I just cheated and got all the stuff for free. Not like they're going moderate it
[0:28:11] <%AmericanSkidd> omg
[0:28:17] <%Xevtes> haha
[0:28:18] <luftraumm1> @patstaresat youcould legitimately play andromeda,  the gameplay really carries the game
[0:28:19] <+kewlmyc> I'd watch it
[0:28:20] <%demiiluna> that was my favorite episode
[0:28:22] <SaltyAzteca> WTF
[0:28:22] <Nightwolf656> LUL LUL
[0:28:24] <%Mr_Pylon> I'm on board with this
[0:28:24] <@tizz86> I'd watch that
[0:28:29] <dekkitout> Where can I watch Doug anyways?
[0:28:31] <blackjack8182> Doug? Like Doug Funny?
[0:28:36] <%peachy996> But Kroguards in 3 are great to have on the team next to Geth Primes, Volus Shield Regenerators and literally any kind of Infiltrator
[0:28:49] <%maenos2> Disney owns it so ask them
[0:28:50] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Fucking haven't see Doug in years
[0:28:50] <$StrawberryPantsu> Disney +?
[0:28:53] <dekkitout> Apparently it's on disney plus, according to google
[0:28:57] <%crimsonharvest> did anyone see those videos on youtube about beating mass effect with no friends
[0:28:59] <%kingofasgard> moshi moshi, anikis, what did i just tune into
[0:29:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT IS DOUG?
[0:29:02] <@MistyMntns> @dekkitout Disney+
[0:29:03] <%psidefx> nice
[0:29:04] <%Xevtes> @dekkitout disney+
[0:29:09] <Astrophizz> disney+ just has the newer seasons
[0:29:12] <@goose_attack_almanac> @BallerSwagBro9k older cartoon
[0:29:18] <%SovPho> he probably sat a computer
[0:29:18] <marvel877> WHAT DOES THE DOUG BUTTON DO?
[0:29:23] <dekkitout> @dekkitout Found it and the movie
[0:29:28] <Parapattern> Doug was my actual favorite show when I was little
[0:29:29] <%AmericanSkidd> you got divorced from the airforce thats rad
[0:29:31] <Profmcstevie> Some parts of the airforce just fix planes
[0:29:31] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> @BallerSwagBro9k Feel old yet
[0:29:36] <+FlareTitan> Okay so we talked about Doug but whens the Pepper Ann conversation?
[0:29:39] <loosecanoness> what had a worse ending: ME3 or GoT?
[0:29:39] <@tizz86> @ballerswagbro9k nickelodeon cartoon from the 90s
[0:29:50] <+D00msDayDan> THEY DESERVE IT
[0:29:51] <%Deano8817> fuck mosquitos
[0:29:52] <%zuzuxiv> holy shit that's scary
[0:29:53] <%Xevtes> amazon for early seasons
[0:29:53] <%peachy996> Neat.
[0:29:55] <%peachy996> Fuck em
[0:29:55] <%KetsuoTaberu> Hooray for the genophage!
[0:29:57] <Latija> good
[0:29:57] <%SovPho> @Profmcstevie most parts of the airforce just sit in front of a monitor
[0:29:59] <%count_bob> GoT
[0:30:00] <+Bigbossman91> @loosecanoness GoT
[0:30:02] <%peachy996> Wasps are next
[0:30:03] <%Dakuu75> no?
[0:30:05] <$StrawberryPantsu> Bats?
[0:30:06] <%AmericanSkidd> GENOPHAGE THE MOSQUITOS
[0:30:07] <blue8moon> but what about the bats?
[0:30:08] <%metalsiren31> Bats do
[0:30:09] <+fetrigon> fuck em
[0:30:09] <@commanderclaw> Just bats
[0:30:09] <DianaTheAscian> COOL LETS KILL EM
[0:30:09] <dekkitout> They -mosquitoes- contribute nothing to the ecosystem
[0:30:11] <%crimsonharvest> mostly only bats and a couple kinds of spiders
[0:30:12] <%greasypete00> craneflies do
[0:30:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @tizz86 OH GOD I REMEMBER THAT
[0:30:13] <Profmcstevie> That's the problem
[0:30:13] <%Grimdogx> Mosquito genocide is morally correct
[0:30:14] <%Solid_Stro> 🦟 sabert14Gun
[0:30:14] <%Mr___Pillow> not even fish?
[0:30:17] <i_chevalier> frogs
[0:30:17] <ZComiX> that me know
[0:30:18] <%dawarw0lf> @loosecanoness I like both but GOT hands down for real. Maybe if the og ending of 3 has a shot but
[0:30:18] <@goose_attack_almanac> some dragonflies
[0:30:19] <Latija> mosquitos are disease spreading monsters, nuke em
[0:30:19] <%zuzuxiv> fuck you pat
[0:30:21] <%KetsuoTaberu> LUL fair enough
[0:30:22] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Only mosquitoshawks
[0:30:22] <%HaroldDonchee> plenty of things do but they THINK other insects would take their place
[0:30:23] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[0:30:23] <%UvBenServed> Damn
[0:30:24] <mikeriffic> Also WASPS, fuck Wasps
[0:30:24] <+FoolsArcade> is it cause you live with a bat?
[0:30:24] <$StrawberryPantsu> Bat's are flying dogs.
[0:30:24] <ZComiX> what about amphibians
[0:30:24] <@SoFarFetched> Well you batter believe it
[0:30:25] <+D00msDayDan> bats can find something else to eat
[0:30:25] <%SovPho> bats kinda gave us this whole deal
[0:30:25] <Madinki> Bat's do but fuck bats
[0:30:27] <%za7az> get rid of the bats, fuck it LUL
[0:30:27] <%peachy996> Bats can eat other stuff
[0:30:27] <%demiiluna> Bats are my favorite bug though!
[0:30:27] <$Futurecity10> Bats are incredible important
[0:30:28] <%zuzuxiv> no pats
[0:30:28] <dekkitout> Some bat poop feeds beetles
[0:30:29] <%BigBlackBankai> Bats have never affected humans, hurr burr
[0:30:29] <blackjack8182> F Mosquitoes
[0:30:29] <%Treasure_Vault> Turtles eat mosquitoes
[0:30:31] <%Cykron> Bats are chill
[0:30:32] <GuyverTypeL> Mosquitos don't provide to anything?
[0:30:33] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt but some Bats are cute
[0:30:35] <%MelBrooksKA> Bat's are pretty sick of you
[0:30:35] <%trackles_64> Bats are omnivores
[0:30:36] <Profmcstevie> I eat fucking spiders by accident, they aren't a staple of my diet either chat
[0:30:36] <%Ches_Neckbeard> save the bee's, genocide the mosquitos
[0:30:36] <%crimsonharvest> but i dont think any insectivore will ever starve because those niches will expode with something else
[0:30:36] <loosecanoness> @bigbossman91 fair
[0:30:37] <%Deano8817> mosquito genocide is a net positive for the entire planet
[0:30:39] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I don't trust it since it started "In China..."
[0:30:39] <+FlareTitan> do it to wasps instead
[0:30:42] <@goose_attack_almanac> This seems like it'll have a landslide effect
[0:30:42] <+dd44dostivei> extermintate fleas
[0:30:43] <%Mr_Pylon> how dare you hate on skydogs
[0:30:43] <%king_wragles> There's a few species, but with actual effort I'd imagine they could be replaced
[0:30:43] <%BigBlackBankai> Definitely
[0:30:44] <Dunmarkh> Fuck mosquitos it's worth it
[0:30:44] <@MistyMntns> Pat No
[0:30:45] <JunkyardCrow> Fuck em, Nuke em
[0:30:45] <williamrooster> mosquito larva is really important for fish
[0:30:45] <DianaTheAscian> Many things can go wrong
[0:30:46] <blue8moon> might have some unintended consequences LUL
[0:30:48] <stantheman_97> don't a lot of things eat the larvae?
[0:30:50] <Vantesla> @loosecanoness GoT. Because nobody talks about it or cares about that series now. Mass Effect even with it's crap ending was talked about and brought back even.
[0:30:51] <%zuzuxiv> global sterilization
[0:30:51] <%ForlornCarton> Dragonflies eat 'em.
[0:30:52] <%dudeitsray> super mosquitos
[0:30:52] <%Ziegsy> has pat seen the japanese shut up gun?
[0:30:52] <Profmcstevie> Cut their numbers in half, see what happens

[0:31:00] <%zuzuxiv> COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION
[0:31:01] <i_chevalier> it could fuck with the bees
[0:31:09] <marvel877> There's literally a Magic School Bus episode showing what could go wrong
[0:31:11] <causewaybob> Nah ice dem bitches
[0:31:14] <MaesePC> it mutated and now it's killing bees !!!
[0:31:15] <%SaiyanShoto> idk mosquitos really serve no purpose, theres more insects to eat
[0:31:17] <%knight1210> good idea

[0:31:26] <@SoFarFetched> At least you know there's different versions of EVA compared to knowing kingdom hearts stuff Kappa
[0:31:27] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> thats the point
[0:31:29] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Yo, Rebuild 3+1 is streaming btw
[0:31:29] <%trackles_64> Karou is best girl
[0:31:30] <%SaiyanShoto> Even Pen Pen?

[0:31:34] <marvel877> They're all bad.
[0:31:34] <dekkitout> I'd say Maya is the most well adjusted
[0:31:37] <%peachy996> I choose the Orange juice
[0:31:39] <%dawarw0lf> Don’t kiss children people

[0:31:42] <luftraumm1> everyone.mp4
[0:31:43] <marvel877> DOOR BELL
[0:31:45] <Latija> my favorite part of eva is misato lures shinji in by sending him sexy pics
[0:31:45] <%MidnightBurst12> yes, but my nightmare is best nightmare
[0:31:45] <Vantesla> Misato is an adult sexually advancing on a minor LUL
[0:31:49] <%peachy996> Glorious Sunny D
[0:31:54] <dekkitout> And Katsuragi... fucking christ...
[0:31:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Misato is a bordline sexual predator
[0:31:55] <%baka_sugoi> ORB
[0:31:55] <Madinki> But Misato is the lesser evil
[0:31:55] <%AmericanSkidd> The real choice is to love yourself
[0:31:59] <blackjack8182> Toji’s sister seems nice
[0:32:04] <%Xevtes> happy bday to that person!
[0:32:08] <+fetrigon> paige go away PunOko

[0:35:00] <%andrewofbob> When the volume of ok stuff is too high and marketing effort becomes a must, the gatekeeping is pointless

[0:35:43] <%trackles_64> I learned aobut Alan Jones cuase of that shit
[0:35:45] <dekkitout> Somehow youtube recommends me stuff based on the things you and Woolie said on the podcast
[0:35:46] <i_chevalier> @davidcrimsonheidern wait? is that just a bidet
[0:35:49] <%crimsonharvest> or if you click even one Warhammer video it's instantly tons of fash and fash-adjacent channels
[0:35:51] <@MistyMntns> That is my Youtube but with Cold Cases and Murder Cases

[0:50:10] <%DrTomT18> You don't survive the end of the world by being polite
[0:50:11] <williamrooster> In my cycle we followed facts and logic commander

[1:00:40] <%jillyrancher> PROMPT
[1:00:41] <Aiutare47> youre distracting him from brooding'
[1:00:42] <%Birdigalore> You've got him so hot talking about shipsd
[1:00:42] <%AmericanSkidd> Shepard feels most like a Shonen protagonist in this game
[1:00:47] <%kingofasgard> OOH SHIP
[1:00:50] <%trackles_64> Bromance
[1:00:52] <+dd44dostivei> shepard looks like socrates
[1:00:52] <%Mr___Pillow> cause space cops marking out on toys
[1:00:53] <%dawarw0lf> Renegade doesn’t care about sentimental things
[1:00:53] <%Ipsenscastle> only good people can recognise spaceships
[1:00:53] <tattleworm> mostly just hit every prompt in 3
[1:00:54] <%James_Quivers> Renegade cares not for ship nerds
[1:00:56] <%JoshManVGH> Cause you're... engaging with his hobby, I guess?
[1:00:58] <Latija> i guess seeing a military ship used by civilians gives them hope??
[1:00:59] <tattleworm> there's 0 logic
[1:00:59] <%RealThiele> makes him feel good about himself?
[1:01:04] <%CoffeeKaiju> was literally just thinking "patshep looks exhausted"
[1:01:07] <%jillyrancher> it distracts Cortez from his grief a bit
[1:01:09] <%teefpal> ACCEPT DEATH
[1:01:12] <%akscully> dude, your husband died months ago, you don't have to move on immediately
[1:01:12] <hereiam407> Feel better steve

[1:01:20] <%Ipsenscastle> repotato
[1:01:24] <%peachy996> I'll say this about Steve, He's boring but he's not as badly written as Gil in Andromeda
[1:01:25] <Lamokmok> Yeah
[1:01:29] <tanarath> Rep is independent.
[1:01:30] <%dawarw0lf> For better RP
[1:01:31] <+D00msDayDan> no more getting fucked because you didn't commit to being a scumbag
[1:01:32] <%peachy996> His romance that is
[1:01:35] <%andrewofbob> Reputation is a way of stopping half-and-halfs getting fucked over
[1:01:39] <%kingofasgard> REPPU-tion
[1:01:40] <%king_wragles> Is there more with the PTSD Asari?
[1:01:42] <Sameriarix> Pfft, you think pat uses his powers
[1:01:42] <%moonmintparadise> Pat Shep in nventory screen and in dialogue looks like a different person lmao
[1:01:44] <Madinki> Your rep makes PARAGON GO UP
[1:01:44] <%Monkeyweed21> it always goes up but its either paragon or renegade flavored
[1:01:44] <DatAsuna> yeah reputation is an improvement over paragon/renegade
[1:01:45] <%James_Quivers> Yeah, to avoid the situation where people couldn't break up the miranda/jack and tali/legion fights
[1:01:46] <%trackles_64> rub em hard
[1:01:46] <%hatok> yeah there's an old director interview where they said they were annoyed people just did all paragon and all renegade, so this was the solution
[1:01:46] <+aartbastiaan> @akscully but there's a war with billions dying tho
[1:01:47] <%Ipsenscastle> sand down his nips
[1:01:47] <%AzureGale> ME3 does morality the best
[1:01:48] <cpt_langosta> rub them with omnigel

[1:01:55] <%AJ_Cherenkov> maybe thane's too
[1:01:58] <DatAsuna> it's hard to be locked out of choices now if you're doing all the quests
[1:01:59] <%NopeBadguy> DONT TIDDY TWIST KAIDEN
[1:01:59] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Reputation determines if you can pick charm or Intimidate in this game
[1:01:59] <BurdRightsActivist> CARTHHHHH TIME
[1:02:00] <%RealThiele> like the award winning MMO FF14?
[1:02:01] <%Puhff> Steve isn't boring; he's just anormal human in a world of borderline superheroes

[1:05:53] <%jillyrancher> mark meer is half the background guys
[1:05:55] <%Puhff> Yeah between that and the rando turian voiced by Mark Near, the choice to have your main VA's voice rando NPCS is wild
[1:05:56] <%kingofasgard> thane?
[1:05:58] <hereiam407> Citadel adds a lot of side stories progressively, its kind of nice, but you have to keep checking the same rooms
[1:06:01] <cpt_langosta> you need to scan every keeper, don't forget thtat
[1:06:04] <%teefpal> @Dunmarkh shes become what she hates most

[1:06:54] <dekkitout> Faish
[1:07:00] <%Ipsenscastle> MORE BLASTO
[1:07:10] <%andrewofbob> Good VAs will get many roles. In guild wars 2, Nolan North plays the human PC and two villains.

[1:07:17] <cpt_langosta> Blasto continues!
[1:07:23] <hereiam407> ooooh
[1:07:29] <RoldanDgr8> you missed septimus
[1:07:30] <%peachy996> There's a reason Steve Blum gets so much work
[1:07:34] <%jillyrancher> nolan North voices multiple characters in every game hes in lol

[1:07:43] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Edi watching all the porn
[1:07:44] <%Dakuu75> who thought that was a good idea
[1:07:46] <%Birdigalore> welcomewelcomewelcome
[1:07:48] <M0untain_wolf> She looking at porn
[1:07:51] <BigFingerRo> @cpt_langosta better blasto than sporto
[1:07:51] <%dudeitsray> im at capacity shepard
[1:07:54] <M0untain_wolf> ROBO PORN
[1:07:55] <%Mr___Pillow> probably cheaper to pay your main voice actor to do random NPC's due to the high volume they're doing already compared to hiring and paying for another voice actor
[1:07:58] <@goose_attack_almanac> why is no one freaking the fuck out over EDI's massive robot honkers walking freely around the Citadel
[1:08:03] <BurdRightsActivist> EDI ain't on the hub, she's on E621 4Head
[1:08:04] <GuyverTypeL> @bigfingerro he will
[1:08:08] <olm46> She's looking at specialized brittle bone disease porn
[1:08:10] <%peachy996> It's wild you can just kill Oraka if you wanted
[1:08:16] <+dd44dostivei> why didn't shepard just shove a gun in that salarians face
[1:08:19] <%RealThiele> shes a diability sex robot for joker is her cover story
[1:08:20] <%jillyrancher> PAT YOU BOUGHT EVERYTHING
[1:08:21] <hereiam407> Weird question, but does EDI feel human, or metallic?
[1:08:22] <Madinki> @goose_attack_almanac Because Robussy
[1:08:26] <williamrooster> giving cops black market wepons ftw
[1:08:26] <%Ipsenscastle> @goose_attack_almanac she's Joker's medical assistance honkers
[1:08:28] <%Alig200> @goose_attack_almanac shes acting as Joker's mobility robot basically, hes entitled to it because of his disability.
[1:08:31] <BigFingerRo> @olm46 ah, boneitis
[1:08:37] <+cermo55> defence is good
[1:08:39] <%DrTomT18> The General isn't at all curious about WHY Shepard cares?
[1:08:44] <+alphonseisbest> @goose_attack_almanac they go over this last stream
[1:08:58] <%jillyrancher> killing Septimus is psychotic when you can save him with just a bit more work
[1:09:06] <%dawarw0lf> She has new things to say but it’s done
[1:09:07] <%AJ_Cherenkov> As you should be

[1:10:44] <1faber> only someone with shepard's confidence could dance like that
[1:10:48] <%teefpal> I like how Shepard's horrible dancing is Canon no matter what you play them as
[1:10:48] <%jillyrancher> one of the multiplayer classes is a Collector, did you know @patstaresat
[1:10:49] <dekkitout> Shep, every time you dance a reaper gets stronger
[1:10:49] <%Arek_1> atpDance
[1:10:50] <+Felremi> Felremi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Keep it up Pat.

[1:10:58] <%Ipsenscastle> @BigFingerRo well he for sure wasn't dancing WITH her
[1:11:03] <%idyota> its a dlc thing
[1:11:03] <Aiutare47> "Awakened collector"
[1:11:03] <%dawarw0lf> He’s “awokenl
[1:11:03] <%AJ_Cherenkov> IT WORKS AWESOME IS HOW
[1:11:06] <%DrTomT18> Levithan spoilers
[1:11:07] <%VioletHeart> It's explained well enough.
[1:11:08] <%DrTomT18> kinda
[1:11:10] <mikeriffic> They "woke" up
[1:11:10] <%James_Quivers> its a WOKE collector
[1:11:10] <%andrewofbob> The collector broke free from indoctrination
[1:11:11] <%teefpal> @dekkitout SHEPARD: Boogies harder
[1:11:12] <%DrTomT18> but not really
[1:11:12] <%AmericanSkidd> oh that is a can of worms
[1:11:12] <Mcjiggyjay> shut it chat
[1:11:12] <godila2> uhhhh spoilers
[1:11:14] <%andrewofbob> somehow
[1:11:18] <mr_saturday93> Something about being free some control
[1:11:19] <kingra> WOKE
[1:11:22] <Mcjiggyjay> SHHH
[1:11:22] <BigFingerRo> @Ipsenscastle HAH true
[1:11:24] <williamrooster> woke collectors
[1:11:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Organic Jerks
[1:11:25] <stormhawk9891> It's  explained in Leviathan dlc
[1:11:26] <%Jmann1892> Reapers abandoned the collectors at the end of ME2 now they're out for REVENGE
[1:11:27] <+NicheNova> How will that help against giant ships?
[1:11:30] <%jillyrancher> ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL OF MY HEART SHEPARD
[1:11:31] <hereiam407> And I know dance
[1:11:31] <Pookiedaexzile> That's the sticking point
[1:11:36] <+aartbastiaan> @andrewofbob that makes no sense lore wise
[1:11:40] <Conscript_Gary> It's Javik in a halloween costume
[1:11:40] <Pookiedaexzile> GANGSTA ARMY
[1:11:41] <dekkitout> Here's an idea- teach Vorcha to be mech pilots
[1:11:42] <%jillyrancher> leviathan DLC explains it
[1:11:45] <Pookiedaexzile> SHut up
[1:11:49] <%Treasure_Vault> Pocket sand is infinitely scaleable
[1:11:51] <%Birdigalore> Kick em in the shins
[1:11:54] <%Mr_Pylon> how do you play dirty against big robot and zombies
[1:11:55] <%trackles_64> BE more agressive with the civillians
[1:11:55] <%DrTomT18> A professional solider might hesitate to do some nasty shit
[1:11:58] <%AzureGale> Personal satisfaction
[1:11:58] <Pookiedaexzile> They're gonna turn their space guns sideways
[1:11:59] <%Puhff> yeah i was just wodering that
[1:12:00] <Profmcstevie> What's the point of playing non dirty
[1:12:00] <Lamokmok> Kick them in the reaper balls!
[1:12:01] <%idyota> shoot their indoctrinated non-combatants
[1:12:01] <%hatok> also why wouldn't the military play dirty in this situation
[1:12:02] <+vaderxyz1970> We're going to use Civilians as bait
[1:12:02] <%Agami23> shoot your own troops to kill the enemy
[1:12:02] <%Ipsenscastle> trick the reapers into running into afake tunnel you painted on a wall
[1:12:02] <@ssjklyco> Kick them in the nuts and bolts
[1:12:03] <godila2> shut up about that character
[1:12:03] <%DrTomT18> like bomb a city to slow down the reapers
[1:12:04] <dekkitout> Bait them with citizens
[1:12:04] <%peachy996> Aria thought it sounded cool
[1:12:04] <williamrooster> they'll shoot the reapers in the nuts
[1:12:04] <+RowenCleric> call them names
[1:12:06] <+FoolsArcade> we're gonna shoot ourselves and go "YOU DIDN'T WIN" to the Reapers
[1:12:07] <+tinytinykittycat> theyre not all a hivemind
[1:12:08] <cpt_langosta> DON'T BREAK THE GENEVA CONVENTION AGAINST... *checks notes* evil space robots...?
[1:12:09] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Mercs will twist all the dicks
[1:12:10] <tanarath> Throw them into the meatgrinder & not shed a tear?
[1:12:14] <thewhiterice92> "I sent wave after wave of my own vorcha until the kill bots reached their kill quotas"
[1:12:15] <%teefpal> Just hire Krenel
[1:12:15] <%AmericanSkidd> Scorched Earth, idk
[1:12:17] <%RetroCop87> call them robot slurs
[1:12:17] <@goose_attack_almanac> Make fun of their smaller tentacle.
[1:12:21] <%Retinolgaming> They are literally trying to genocide us, everything is already on the table. There are no war crimes against reapers LUL
[1:12:23] <stantheman_97> war crimes shouldn't matter against certain eldrich genocide
[1:12:23] <Aiutare47> I mean thats kinda the point that the two door guards mention, Reapers are scary because you cant just nuke their planet, their people are your people.
[1:12:24] <RoldanDgr8> lightly jog
[1:12:25] <%peachy996> Omega Logic I guess to call it playing dirty
[1:12:34] <%peachy996> When no one will be complaining
[1:12:34] <%andrewofbob> @aartbastiaan Yeah, I feel it's excuse-level to make a "protean" playable, but having a 2nd Javik would be even more extreme
[1:12:35] <Pookiedaexzile> They're gonna sell drugs in the Reapers communities
[1:12:38] <Profmcstevie> I suppose the thought is that you might hesitate to risk a planet of civvies to take out a reaper or somethin
[1:12:38] <teridax4> Use willy pete on the robots
[1:12:40] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> indoctrinated people would be a taboo target probably
[1:12:43] <BigFingerRo> I like that shep doesn't run looking down anymore, he corrected his posture
[1:12:45] <olaksi> has any tried throwing pocket sand at the reapers
[1:12:46] <%DrTomT18> yee
[1:12:49] <hereiam407> Shepard speeding by everyone in the Citdael
[1:12:51] <%RealThiele> Aria probably says it that way so the stupid vorcha agree
[1:12:51] <%teefpal> Shepards doing the Jamrock Shuffle
[1:12:55] <%AJ_Cherenkov> makes sense
[1:12:58] <Dunmarkh> yeah that seems ethical
[1:13:02] <cpt_langosta> ye
[1:13:04] <+tinytinykittycat> go for it
[1:13:06] <tanarath> sounds good
[1:13:07] <%Ipsenscastle> follow your heart

[1:13:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt theres a codex entry or something that describes how the Reapers are totally incapable of dealing with the Vorcha cuz they breed too fast to harvest and adapt to whatever they try
[1:13:16] <%jillyrancher> unfortunately
[1:13:17] <%DrTomT18> you should always approve them, save for like one. The one where the Asari wants a gun, don't do that one
[1:13:17] <BigFingerRo> @hereiam407 does he say VROOM VROOM when he does it?
[1:13:17] <ToneBacas> @Pookiedaexzile what is this, the Reagan administration? also interesting name

[1:14:48] <dekkitout> "I leaked our tapes, Shep"
[1:14:50] <+senfood> It's ok, Kelly. You saved my fish.
[1:14:52] <Pookiedaexzile> She was fucking for intelligence
[1:14:52] <+D00msDayDan> is her collarbone fucked up or is that part of her top?
[1:14:53] <@ssjklyco> They did a good job on Kellys model. She REAAALY looks like she's seen some shit.
[1:14:53] <FassieFons> not evil, just dumb
[1:14:53] <ToneBacas> as if it weren't super obvious she would do that eventually
[1:14:54] <%Ipsenscastle> @kingofasgard that really got me, haha
[1:14:56] <M0untain_wolf> and we banged

[1:14:59] <%dawarw0lf> What about tail SHEPARD
[1:14:59] <%Zalapski> she literally kills herself if you mess that up
[1:15:00] <%Mr___Pillow> don't the Husk spikes mine for certain minerals while replacing others to make them cyborgish?
[1:15:00] <stantheman_97> that's not really a betrayal given that it's assumed
[1:15:00] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt If you don't forgive her, she kills herself.
[1:15:00] <%RealThiele> i mean shes pretty dumb
[1:15:00] <%Deft_Thought> God, this game
[1:15:01] <%bassoontyphoon> Was that not her job
[1:15:01] <%Birdigalore> Get some of that humussy
[1:15:01] <+tinytinykittycat> you fed my fish

[1:15:10] <%HaroldDonchee> how did you not realize that could be uncool kelly
[1:15:11] <ape_hawk> its true; its in the bible
[1:15:12] <arkv01> make up and bang
[1:15:13] <SaltyAzteca> SHE SAVED THE FISH GUYS
[1:15:13] <%AmericanSkidd> but did she fuck your fish?
[1:15:15] <%Treasure_Vault> Had you blamed her, she would have not ended well
[1:15:17] <%DrTomT18> hey, she's basically your secratary. You're expected to flirt with her
[1:15:17] <%maenos2> SHE FUCKS SHARKDOGS THOUG
[1:15:21] <FassieFons> but she gave varen stds to your crew
[1:15:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Kelly showed your dick holograms
[1:15:24] <%kingofasgard> @Ipsenscastle then me staying up past 2am was worth it
[1:15:25] <%jillyrancher> Forgive her!
[1:15:27] <BurdRightsActivist> @AmericanSkidd KappaPride
[1:15:27] <+allups> she looks like a RE protagonist
[1:15:33] <hereiam407> Shepard, look at this photograph
[1:15:35] <%RetroCop87> HI HUBBAND
[1:15:37] <olm46> Kelly will give the reapers diseases
[1:15:38] <%Rumbutt> someone saying "What about Tali" as though Kelly is 1000% aiming for a threesome here lbr
[1:15:40] <HeroToxiko> @Treasure_Vault she is down diabolical
[1:15:43] <%dawarw0lf> Time for big meeting

[1:15:44] <%bassoontyphoon> He is over it
[1:15:44] <stantheman_97> it's safe to assume everyone one the crew except joker and the aliens are snitching
[1:15:45] <+aartbastiaan> Kelly had that varren STD
[1:15:46] <%peachy996> We need to shoot GUNS
[1:15:46] <M0untain_wolf> still bang kelly
[1:15:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Kelly is a Silent Hill protag
[1:15:47] <%Rumbutt> isn't*
[1:15:48] <%Birdigalore> Kelly kept spamming the Illusive man with Shepard dick pics.
[1:15:53] <cpt_langosta> It's time to bully Salarians
[1:15:56] <Alzero83> Space fish suck
[1:15:57] <%Ipsenscastle> @kingofasgard I'm also sleep deprived, I think we're probably on the same stupid tired wavelength

[1:16:38] <+Sadira_snack_attack> personally I enjoy delaying going through the relay in ME2 to watch Kelly turn to goo
[1:16:40] <Pookiedaexzile> between you

[1:25:31] <%Monkeyweed21> JAVIK IS GREAT HERE PAT
[1:25:33] <%dawarw0lf> EVERYONE HAS GOOD LINES
[1:25:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat don't need no man
[1:25:33] <%James_Quivers> Javik generally has good dialogue, but some options are usually better
[1:25:35] <%peachy996> Liara needs to die is what she needs
[1:25:35] <williamrooster> OG CREW
[1:25:35] <%maenos2> GARRUS HAS A GOOD LINE THER AND THERE'S A GOOD JOKE BETWEEN LIARA AND GARRUS GO THE OG CREW
[1:25:35] <%CanadianAdam> javik has the best dialogue on every single mission
[1:25:36] <DatAsuna> People are gonna scream javik at you for literally every mission, they are wrong
[1:25:36] <Profmcstevie> Chat we physically can not have every dialogue holy shit
[1:25:38] <$Futurecity10> Javik has so many good lines, its a shame
[1:25:40] <Jaysky> Javik is fuckin DLC you don't need him for shit
[1:25:40] <+Slydc> javik shits on the salarians its great
[1:25:44] <Madinki> BUT JAVIK NEED YOU
[1:25:45] <%Ipsenscastle> Javik is genuinely great here
[1:25:46] <cooldude69xx> Shut it about Javik, its one joke
[1:25:50] <%bassoontyphoon> The two Krogan squadmates are back together
[1:25:50] <blue8moon> If javik was actually necessary for main story missions, he wouldn't be a dlc character LUL
[1:25:51] <mikeriffic> number go up
[1:25:53] <%bread_assassin> OG CREW
[1:25:54] <Zombrocom> Stop yelling :(
[1:25:55] <%gliph13> ah well, Javiks best line is if Wreeve is clan leader anyway.
[1:25:56] <godila2> javic is only must for very late mission
[1:26:01] <GustauveVIII> hurricane
[1:26:04] <HyperionXV> Might want some sort of long range weapon as backup
[1:26:07] <%peachy996> I think the shottie will go better for you than last time
[1:26:07] <generalve> DELICACY
[1:26:09] <QuestlordJake> ebryone like the damage
[1:26:11] <%barrakuta371> All Javik does is poop on the Salarians
[1:26:11] <+senfood> Put a good gun on Liara's butt.
[1:26:13] <%teefpal> Do you think a warlike species thats been spat on for a thousand years is going to peacefully rejoin galactic society?  When krogan birthrates explode, that human colonies aren't going to be burnt to the ground and replaced by krogan colonies?
[1:26:13] <GustauveVIII> N7 Hurricane is the only gun
[1:26:13] <%peachy996> Thinking on this map
[1:26:14] <%jillyrancher> I almost never use Javik
[1:26:16] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Og Crew is better then one joke
[1:26:17] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Pat Javik makes the Salarians very uncomfortable
[1:26:17] <%JoshManVGH> The Typhon is an assult rifle!?
[1:26:18] <Vantesla> can give her better trash LUL
[1:26:18] <%Mr_Pylon> I still can't get over that bullying line, holy shit
[1:26:19] <%dawarw0lf> I need an smg or pistol
[1:26:21] <+fetrigon> nerd liara vs chad javik
[1:26:22] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt So how are you liking the game?
[1:26:23] <%CanadianAdam> I stand with the NoPats
[1:26:24] <%homelesstwinky> hurricane brrrrt
[1:26:25] <%toastybites> ASS
[1:26:28] <%teefpal> One Gun
[1:26:28] <%Ipsenscastle> Javik basically lists all the ways he would eat a salarian right to their faces
[1:26:29] <$Futurecity10> Hurricane is a monster
[1:26:29] <Ekaelis> Javik is best on Thessia
[1:26:31] <+aartbastiaan> @jaysky false
[1:26:31] <Sameriarix> +power mod
[1:26:31] <tattleworm> acolyte's an asari weapon, it fits
[1:26:32] <Aiutare47> For what its worth, companions do not have any weight penalties
[1:26:34] <%andrewofbob> Nurrican is nutty; you should try it some time
[1:26:36] <tanarath> POWER
[1:26:37] <%kingofasgard> "in my cycle, i was a killjoy too"
[1:26:38] <blackjack8182> Hurricane
[1:26:38] <%jillyrancher> hurricane
[1:26:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Javik gets SUPER racist in this mission
[1:26:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Give her the Acolyte pistol too
[1:26:40] <DatAsuna> smgs are generally the most underhwelming class in me3
[1:26:48] <%DrTomT18> N7 guns are good
[1:26:49] <+tinytinykittycat> power magnifier is good
[1:26:49] <%jillyrancher> I like the punisher too
[1:26:51] <%CanadianAdam> at least watch Javik's dialogue on youtube after
[1:26:52] <%lloyddboy> GUN HELP YOU BRAIN HARDER
[1:26:53] <Jaysky> @teefpal Wouldn't be human colonies in this case thats for sure
[1:27:02] <+aartbastiaan> @datasuna amd gain tons
[1:27:08] <%DrTomT18> It's a good gun
[1:27:12] <%jillyrancher> Javik is racist on every mission dont always bring him
[1:27:12] <Jaysky> @aartbastiaan What's false? That he was DLC? He was.
[1:27:16] <mikeriffic> N7 one
[1:27:19] <tattleworm> love me some piranha
[1:27:19] <%dawarw0lf> Venom
[1:27:21] <%CanadianAdam> the katana is the worst thing ever
[1:27:25] <+DracosMagala> Piranha?
[1:27:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Acolyte is basically a mini grenade launcher
[1:27:27] <blackjack8182> Harrier!
[1:27:28] <%andrewofbob> Use the best sniper: the Crusader shotgun
[1:27:30] <dekkitout> Not the flamey-shockey crime engine?
[1:27:31] <%CanadianAdam> wraith > eviscerator
[1:27:33] <%dawarw0lf> Wraith is a better version
[1:27:35] <vicepresidentrichardhawk> Piranha
[1:27:36] <%Monkeyweed21> the N7 is great
[1:27:39] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Wait

[1:28:17] <%jillyrancher> you cant unfortunately
[1:28:18] <%DrTomT18> You'll just have to tough it out Pat
[1:28:21] <%homelesstwinky> you can change at a bench or gun pickup
[1:28:22] <+alphonseisbest> do it later
[1:28:22] <williamrooster> I think there is a weapons beach early on
[1:28:27] <%RetroCop87> ARE YOU READY TO CHARGE SOME TURRETS!?!?!?

[1:28:31] <%CanadianAdam> restart and bring javik
[1:28:32] <%dawarw0lf> Each time you pick up a weapon you can change
[1:28:33] <Jaysky> @aartbastiaan And he isn't necessary for this mission nor the full game. I do agree however that he adds a LOT to certain missions.

[1:36:24] <$realm_forge> Wrex are you my grandpa?
[1:36:27] <%DrTomT18> Wrex has had a ton of character development
[1:36:28] <intestinal_bleeding> oof

[1:36:29] <HeroToxiko> wrex he brute he shoot

[1:36:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Came good out the box
[1:36:30] <%peachy996> And yet Wrex is still better
[1:36:31] <%dawarw0lf> He’s had some character development
[1:36:31] <+unhuggable1> some people never change
[1:36:34] <Sol_Install> wrex was perfect already
[1:36:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AND YET HES STILL THE BEST
[1:36:34] <wolfen091> don't need development if you're perfect already
[1:36:35] <%James_Quivers> Wrex is only slightly less crazy now
[1:36:35] <olaksi> you cant get character development when you are already max level
[1:36:36] <choocheess> i think wrex has a lot of char development in this game
[1:36:39] <+alphonseisbest> He was BORN perfect
[1:36:41] <%dawarw0lf> He used to not care about his people
[1:36:42] <IvanMistwalker> I love Liara

[1:36:53] <digaogrunge> Wrex is king now, thats char dev
[1:36:54] <DatAsuna> @aartbastiaan He says the same race shit here he does in every other scene. I like race jokes but ruining every quest in the game to get the same joke is silly.
[1:36:56] <Pookiedaexzile> He wasn't born perfect, he needed the scar
[1:36:59] <%Rumbutt> Well Liara is essentially a baby while Wrex is what, middle aged?
[1:37:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> YIKES

[1:49:01] <%dukeofhammer> Stupid idiot

[1:49:11] <FassieFons> SNIFF

[1:49:13] <Madinki> ALMOST BLINE MOMENT THERE

[1:49:17] <Mattais88> Reminder that maelon went crazy after accidently commiting warcrimes
[1:49:20] <%YakumoYomi> Not allowed!

[1:49:44] <1faber> everyone important survived
[1:49:44] <%andrewofbob> Red shirt
[1:49:49] <%RealThiele> BAMB
[1:49:51] <%Ipsenscastle> still blind
[1:49:52] <%HaroldDonchee> that wasn't very impressive for a space bomb
[1:49:52] <DatAsuna> I like that your shields refresh after you get up
[1:49:52] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Missed Item
[1:49:53] <cpt_langosta> Did Cerberus just... put the bomb in there and send the elevator down? Why do it like that?
[1:49:55] <hereiam407> @peachy996 Lol, its burned into my brain
[1:50:02] <%Dakuu75> does a female krogan have boobs?
[1:50:10] <%jillyrancher> For real this story arc is by far my favorite section of the game
[1:50:17] <choocheess> wow they fucked up the place fast
[1:50:18] <TheAntiNihilist> imagine if the bomb didn't beep
[1:50:19] <%DrTomT18> @Dakuu75 No, they lay eggs, I believe
[1:50:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> FUCK THE KIRBEES
[1:50:19] <%YakumoYomi> Ya'll remember this multiplayer level?
[1:50:21] <dekkitout> Not comrades, former coworkers
[1:50:23] <Latija> oh no, turrets
[1:50:29] <%kingofasgard> then it's a good thing we have kirrahe
[1:50:30] <Explodincatz> looks like Halo 2
[1:50:31] <%RealThiele> krogan give birth to egg piles, so no booba needed
[1:50:36] <%RJay80> I will shoot anything and everyone to get the female out. Even the salarians
[1:50:37] <hereiam407> @Dakuu75 how may quads do they have?
[1:50:39] <%peachy996> The MP version of this Map is NOT fun on High Difficulties
[1:50:39] <%Deft_Thought> I like that Cerberus is powerful enough to just attack the fucking Salarian home planet
[1:50:41] <+redthebaron> like the salarians talk a lot about their science but they did eat shit real fast on their homeplane
[1:50:41] <%jillyrancher> really cant Express how much I love the Krogan saving
[1:50:56] <%count_bob> this was my second favorite level
[1:51:02] <choocheess> that guy popped
[1:51:05] <%peachy996> the MP version of this map can kick your ass lol
[1:51:08] <%kingofasgard> melted

[1:51:11] <DatAsuna> good music, good stage
[1:51:20] <karl_rex> This is time based
[1:51:23] <%jillyrancher> @deft_thought They are using a ton of Reaper tech. and its probably a small strike force

[1:52:27] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Make ALL the bad decisions lol
[1:52:27] <%Zalapski> I think what I like best about mass effect is that EVERY species is generally horrible

[1:59:14] <%NopeBadguy> why is garrus floor tanking bro
[1:59:16] <%SovPho> When did [Gold Experience] become the default vanguard punch?

[2:02:08] <%dawarw0lf> I want to see if it works
[2:02:10] <%AmericanSkidd> turret mode activate
[2:02:11] <Aiutare47> Venom is a lot of fun, and can kill even behind cover
[2:02:11] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt No point, you can manually make him use it

[2:04:56] <%kingofasgard> gun on the blacony
[2:04:58] <tanarath> dunno, main area?
[2:05:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> So I just realized that both Liara and her mother's type is himbos
[2:05:02] <+alphonseisbest> SHEPARD KROGAN
[2:05:03] <+GuilKato> wait isn't shepard already an honorary korgan

[2:05:07] <%JoshManVGH> @alphonseisbest No I've been unable to deal with those bastards effectively. Haven't bought pull. But if that works I'm buying the Hell out of it!
[2:05:08] <%dawarw0lf> Semi auto sniper
[2:05:11] <%afronooch> raptor was my baby in multiplayer
[2:05:12] <%Deft_Thought> "Once you're honorary Krogan, you can say the really bad slurs!"
[2:05:19] <%jillyrancher> PAT YOU MISSED THE RAPTOR
[2:05:21] <%dawarw0lf> I don’t like it
[2:05:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt theres a computer log you missed
[2:05:28] <%DrTomT18> hopefully that computer log wasn't important
[2:05:29] <DatAsuna> it's too weak for my taste, I still want some power on my semi autos
[2:05:29] <+GuilKato> I mean he did grunt's rite with him, is the best bro forever with Wrex etc,
[2:05:34] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Still miss the Log
[2:05:34] <%andrewofbob> He unmissed it
[2:05:37] <syd_fishes> raptor takes too many clicks for me
[2:05:37] <+Goraka91> @ErikFeral In fact 2 makes it pretty obvious with notes from the Elusive Man that the team is custom made to make Cerberus look as least evil as possible
[2:05:37] <cpt_langosta> more like CRAPtor
[2:05:46] <Conscript_Gary> Krogan slurs must be fucking crazy
[2:05:48] <%dawarw0lf> He doesn’t need to get every single log
[2:05:54] <%peachy996> Why is her voice labored? The Pod Integrity is fine
[2:05:56] <%peachy996> ish
[2:05:56] <hereiam407> Damn Krogees
[2:06:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I cant believe Pat missed the Raptor Kappa
[2:06:02] <jorniev> reminder that typing behind you to a streamer is beyond useless
[2:06:02] <syd_fishes> @cpt_langosta true
[2:06:13] <%jillyrancher> I like how Nemesis use the semi auto AR Sniper as a one shot Widow
[2:06:16] <IvanMistwalker> who did Pat romanced?
[2:06:17] <%dawarw0lf> Fun fact: If you wait reinforcements show up
[2:06:26] <cpt_langosta> time for robot

[2:24:01] <+alphonseisbest> HERD ONTO PISS
[2:24:02] <akitanito> paragon interrupt pee
[2:24:02] <Explodincatz> PISS THE LINE
[2:24:10] <%AmericanSkidd> I wonder
[2:24:11] <Sp3ctre48> Kirrahe really loves that speech he made that one time
[2:24:16] <%RealThiele> ..
[2:24:17] <Alzero83> Jeezus pat, you may wanna get your colon checked
[2:24:17] <%teefpal> 'Hey guys so I got some upgrades [God Mode: Enabled]
[2:24:18] <+alphonseisbest> HARD PISS PAT HARD, WE'LL KNOW IF IT ISN'T
[2:24:22] <%jillyrancher> I have to go now unfortunately but I'll catch the rest later tonight
[2:24:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Quickly now: which party member has the sexiest voice? GO
[2:24:34] <%dukeofhammer> Garrus
[2:24:34] <Sp3ctre48> Garrus
[2:24:35] <@MistyMntns> Thane
[2:24:35] <hereiam407> Can he keep it under his previous piss time
[2:24:39] <Shatterthought> @tattleworm no, it's an actual paragon option in 3
[2:24:40] <IntrepidEye> Garrus duh
[2:24:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Thane
[2:24:43] <%teefpal> @Alzero83 There's nothing funny about colon cancer.
[2:24:43] <%dawarw0lf> I CANT WAIT FOR PAT TO PUNCH A QUARIAN
[2:24:44] <+Bigbossman91> Garrus duh
[2:24:44] <%MightyDuckShoes> Aww. I liked Rana.
[2:24:47] <+alphonseisbest> @GarbageQueenEllie Liara, its lightning's va
[2:24:48] <%CatastropheCorvid> Tali
[2:25:01] <dekkitout> Samara really does it for me
[2:25:03] <hereiam407> Tali
[2:25:10] <$antibonehurtingjuice> TIL they made a season to of Titans
[2:25:10] <hereiam407> Wait, Samara
[2:25:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> @alphonseisbest Good choice. I like most of them, but for some reason Grunt's hits different
[2:25:25] <%afronooch> Samara or [Redacted from DLC]
[2:25:27] <%teefpal> Samara is the one who got away for me
[2:25:33] <williamrooster> I think the asari scientist is the only time paragon choices lead no a negative outcome
[2:25:34] <hereiam407> Grunt sounds like a baby a little though
[2:25:43] <+alphonseisbest> @GarbageQueenEllie steve blum's still got it!
[2:25:47] <%teefpal> Garrus is my fav for FemShep, no competition
[2:25:48] <Shatterthought> @williamrooster it's not.
[2:25:55] <%CatastropheCorvid> @antibonehurtingjuice Yeah and it was so edgy it cut my internet bill in half.
[2:25:56] <@goose_attack_almanac> Tali.
[2:26:01] <@goose_attack_almanac> She hits the Velma zone
[2:26:03] <%dawarw0lf> If you kill the Queen the paragon choice is the worst one
[2:26:08] <dekkitout> @teefpal The one fossil record that'll never be carbon dated
[2:26:08] <%peachy996> Garrus for Femshep
[2:26:18] <%peachy996> (Should be MShep but whatever)
[2:26:21] <IntrepidEye> Tali is a close second followed by Mordin
[2:26:23] <@QueequegTheater> Ashley, because my love of bimbos overrides the logical thinky part of my brain
[2:26:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> @alphonseisbest That must be it. Gotta check out his other work
[2:26:26] <%dawarw0lf> Kelly also dies if you do the paragon
[2:26:39] <%peachy996> Thane is fun to make you Femshep just suffer all sorts of losses.
[2:26:42] <%peyodogo> tali is the ultimate space racist
[2:26:43] <hereiam407> No one is picking EDI, no robot love
[2:26:59] <@MistyMntns> EDI is kinda just there and she is there for Joker
[2:27:01] <@goose_attack_almanac> @QueequegTheater this is a person who knows themself. I still laugh about how she has lip gloss and eye shadow after getting put into the hosptal.
[2:27:03] <williamrooster> @dawarw0lf true but you have to do a renegade choice before in order for that to be bad
[2:27:09] <%CatastropheCorvid> @hereiam407 They said voice, not body?
[2:27:11] <%peachy996> Do the Suicide Mission with a few  key survivors and Thane and watch it all come tumbling down in ME3
[2:27:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Traynor's thirst for Edi's voice more than makes up for all of us
[2:27:37] <hereiam407> @CatastropheCorvid She sounds too much like Siri I think
[2:28:04] <%peachy996> I think the Jack romance is pretty good overall
[2:28:04] <%CatastropheCorvid> @hereiam407 Which Siri? Kappa
[2:28:06] <hereiam407> Also, EDI just feels like metal, right? Not human? It's been bothering me ever since I played ME3
[2:28:21] <%dawarw0lf> I guess Legion’s mission also has a negative effect too if done paragon
[2:28:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Traynor's accent tho... reminds me of Bastila...
[2:28:33] <hereiam407> @CatastropheCorvid Standard female British Siri
[2:28:41] <stormhawk9891> @hereiam407 More like Siri sounds too much like EDI (EDI did come first right?)
[2:28:59] <@goose_attack_almanac> @hereiam407 I think she can manipulate how her outer layer feels. She can harden her hair into the shell thing she has at will.
[2:29:03] <%Alig200> what was that one game recently that actually used the original voice of Siri in their game? trying to remember
[2:29:18] <+Fallensymbol> P5 strikers?
[2:29:21] <hereiam407> @stormhawk9891 Siri was first by a few months
[2:29:32] <Sp3ctre48> Usually Paragon is the option they really want you to pick so there aren't many times where that'll have actual consequences
[2:29:34] <%Alig200> @Fallensymbol yes! thank you!
[2:29:42] <hereiam407> @goose_attack_almanac I thought the same
[2:29:44] <%dawarw0lf> Edi is an infiltration bob meant to disguise with humans and made by Cerberus. You better believe it has EVERYTHING
[2:29:55] <stormhawk9891> @hereiam407 Eh, close enough I guess
[2:30:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @hereiam407 based on Dr. Eva, EDI can get fake skin and become more or less indistinguishable from a human
[2:30:06] <Shatterthought> You let a killer get away in Samara's recruitment if you pick the paragon option
[2:30:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> @dawarw0lf "everything"...? Kappa
[2:30:35] <hereiam407> Fully functional
[2:30:36] <%Alig200> @Shatterthought Oh yeah, that merc Elnora who ends up being the one responsible for murdering a volus
[2:30:39] <perfectharbinger> The big one, for me, is Rana Thanoptis. Sparing her is the Paragon option and, spoiler alert, it's a bad option lol.
[2:30:51] <stormhawk9891> @GarbageQueenEllie How else is Joker gonna hit that puss?

[2:32:04] <Sp3ctre48> That was a weird thing to say Shepard
[2:32:05] <hereiam407> Man, we should make some sort of birth control for the krogans
[2:32:07] <akitanito> use baby krogans as ammo

[2:37:05] <@QueequegTheater> Does he even have lips
[2:37:06] <%andrewofbob> S-tier in multiplayer are geth infiltrator and geth juggernaut
[2:37:07] <stantheman_97> does that mean anderson and shepard have fat asses?
[2:37:08] <hereiam407> Krogan lips are rough
[2:37:12] <Sp3ctre48> @Shubreaker A few of the Batarian classes were super good in the multiplayer since they had tons of invulnerability on their heavy melee
[2:37:12] <%AmericanSkidd> We never learn where it was being built do we?
[2:37:14] <%SovPho> on tali? damage
[2:37:15] <%HaroldDonchee> wrexs laugh might be the best thing in this game

[2:37:19] <%andrewofbob> 200 is the cap
[2:37:21] <IntrepidEye> no

[2:37:23] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> it caps
[2:37:24] <+RyanTheRecluse> it has a cap

[2:37:26] <%count_bob> not really
[2:37:26] <+Soliloquy123> I'm so glad the NPCs talk to each other so much in this game
[2:37:26] <Shatterthought> nope
[2:37:28] <DatAsuna> there's also a cap on what the 200% is relative to
[2:37:33] <%andrewofbob> But you can bring bigger guns

[2:41:54] <%teefpal> @Shubreaker It seems like he'd be WAY more pissed off given how he reacts to Shep's renagade choice on Tuchunka

[2:43:55] <cooldude69xx> based
[2:44:03] <+alphonseisbest> damn
[2:44:07] <Pookiedaexzile> The Cum is stored in the have a sad
[2:44:12] <+D00msDayDan> calling her eve is so on the nose it made me sneeze
[2:44:18] <Sp3ctre48> Asks Mordin to save the data: "Mordin how could you use the result of those terrible experiments" BabyRage
[2:44:31] <%Shubreaker> :(
[2:44:31] <ToneBacas> aww
[2:44:34] <%peachy996> Good thing Eve not her real name
[2:44:36] <+redthebaron> damn
[2:44:41] <%AmericanSkidd> I love that line
[2:44:43] <%dawarw0lf> He made a mistake
[2:44:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Bitch
[2:44:46] <Latija> ok yeah yeah whatever Mordin
[2:44:48] <hereiam407> And I can change my mind at anytime shepard
[2:44:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> @D00msDayDan Should have named her Ishtar or some shit
[2:44:55] <retrosadness> salarians fuckin suck
[2:45:00] <$hattrick61> i made him a steak
[2:45:11] <%Treuan> He said the line
[2:45:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Second best Salarian
[2:45:16] <%peachy996> mmm steaks
[2:45:19] <+D00msDayDan> @GarbageQueenEllie man that's a way better name for a krogan
[2:45:22] <Jaysky> THE LINE
[2:45:26] <cpt_langosta> time for seashells
[2:45:29] <ToneBacas> hmmm
[2:45:30] <Maids4lyfe> had to be him
[2:45:34] <1faber> i wish a salarian would read me a bedtime story sometimes
[2:45:37] <%moonmintparadise> he is so fucking cool
[2:45:37] <Sp3ctre48> This plot is great but I kinda wish Mordin stayed on the pro genophage side since two fan favorites being on the same side means there's no real debate on which one is right
[2:45:38] <tanarath> Ishtar fits SO much better
[2:45:44] <%miguelrod777> seashell experiments LUL
[2:45:47] <%za7az> LUL
[2:45:48] <Pookiedaexzile> "Hey mordin sure you aint got four eyes"
[2:45:48] <hereiam407> yay
[2:45:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> @D00msDayDan Ikr and she literally raises hell for petty bs
[2:45:54] <%HaroldDonchee> Solis sells seashells
[2:45:59] <%walternatorz> Mordin is the most influential man in the galaxy
[2:46:07] <stantheman_97> love my little war criminal
[2:46:13] <%Mr_Pylon> that was Gief sounding like a squeeky door?
[2:46:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> dude Ishtar is a badass name
[2:46:23] <Alzero83> how many breaks is that so far
[2:46:27] <Mattais88> Mordins bit in Citadel is great
[2:46:27] <%teefpal> Gief has found the Chaos Emeralds
[2:46:28] <%castlerock42> @Sp3ctre48 He can stay pro genophage if conditions are right.
[2:46:42] <%dawarw0lf> Sucks that Mordin’s outburst only happens in a renegade playthough
[2:46:50] <%CalderGaming> @walternatorz BEHIND sHEPARD
[2:46:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ishtar's easily my favorite Lovers Persona
[2:46:57] <%CalderGaming> whoops, caps
[2:47:07] <%AmericanSkidd> I'm sure its because of an image from a long time ago but I imagine Mordin at the beach in one of those striped body swimsuits from the 50's
[2:47:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat lives for five seconds we got defenders of the krogan genocide
[2:47:18] <%Dakuu75> wait... is this still his first brb after starting the game?
[2:47:19] <%teefpal> @Sp3ctre48 It take Wrex AND Eve dying , so most players wont get it
[2:47:20] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 I know but like..in general it would have been more of a interesting choice if we was consistently against Wrex
[2:47:22] <@goose_attack_almanac> Mordin on a beach like Hojo
[2:47:42] <%dukeofhammer> Baby
[2:47:43] <%Treuan> Aww

[2:47:51] <Profmcstevie> He want eat batteries
[2:47:54] <Aiutare47> @Sp3ctre48 I mean, I kinda agree with Mordin the whole way through. Original Genophage was valid, but now it doesn't matter with the Reapers exterminating life

[2:48:11] <%Birdigalore> I really wish digs had even a little object permanence lol
[2:48:16] <@QueequegTheater> You mean every bulldog?
[2:48:18] <hereiam407> Teach Gief to rollerblade
[2:48:20] <Sp3ctre48> As it is we have Wrex and mordin against....the Salarian Dalatrass, and it's like, who is going to argue for the latter? lmao
[2:48:22] <QuestlordJake> cause they're rad
[2:48:24] <%justcallmebobplease> Oh for real?

[2:48:27] <%MostFrank> Hell yes
[2:48:27] <stantheman_97> because they're lazy?
[2:48:28] <%lloyddboy> RADICAL
[2:48:28] <@QueequegTheater> They're literally constructed to be able to skateboard
[2:48:30] <ErikFeral> get gief a skateboard
[2:48:31] <williamrooster> thats like asking pat if he has internet
[2:48:31] <Frade> get him one
[2:48:32] <%HaroldDonchee> desire the speed
[2:48:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pro skater bulldogs
[2:48:32] <%JoshManVGH> Dog fear of "Gone forever!" is equal parts sad and adorable.
[2:48:32] <Frade> nowww
[2:48:32] <DianaTheAscian> do we know why?
[2:48:33] <%MostFrank> that's great
[2:48:35] <thep3asantking> Hey pat, seen the new Evangelion film?
[2:48:35] <Profmcstevie> Because they can move better than their little legs can?
[2:48:37] <%teefpal> It's easier for them to breathe

[2:48:43] <Jaysky> Bulldogs? More like skatedogs
[2:48:43] <+fromnibelheim> just a pure passion for shredding
[2:48:44] <%Ches_Neckbeard> get gief a board to be a big skater boi so he can say see you later boi
[2:48:46] <@QueequegTheater> Their body shape lends them to balancing easily

[2:48:47] <%dawarw0lf> They lazy
[2:48:48] <@Ranryu692> there's a skateboarding bulldog in my neighborhood. it is very cute
[2:48:49] <choocheess> its the power of the lazy
[2:48:50] <%MidnightBurst12> science can't explain it
[2:48:51] <+MillerLowlife> they evolved in nature alongside skateboards
[2:48:57] <akitanito> low rida
[2:48:58] <%justcallmebobplease> BULLDOG BALANCE POWERS
[2:48:58] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> They have a need for speed
[2:48:58] <%dudeitsray> picturing gief with a little skater helmet
[2:48:59] <+VantaXIV> generically breed to be rad as fuck
[2:49:01] <Profmcstevie> When moving is a nightmare, automation feels fun
[2:49:05] <dekkitout> Can they kickflip?
[2:49:06] <ShiningAxis> gief didn't try to steal some dude's skateboard, that was tony hawk he tried to steal from
[2:49:08] <choocheess> i thought she was about to bow lol
[2:49:08] <%teefpal> Cant wait to see a dog to a kickflip
[2:49:09] <%Dakuu75> *Superman by Goldfinger, intensifies*
[2:49:11] <+bear_breaker20> avoiding movement is based
[2:49:11] <@QueequegTheater> Reminder that the Dog Whisperer never beat the bulldog
[2:49:24] <%moonmintparadise> wow the females are not so bulky huh
[2:49:28] <Pookiedaexzile> He aint no bull
[2:49:32] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 i don't disagree with Mordin at all, I just wish the conflict wasn't so one sided
[2:49:35] <%peachy996> Eve is cool because you get a perspective from the females
[2:49:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ahh hence the nun outfit
[2:49:41] <%Dakuu75> that's not what I expected a female krogan to sound like. Some how.
[2:49:44] <Vi_Stri> I love her
[2:49:58] <perfectharbinger> You can feel the difference between female krogans and male krogans already.
[2:49:59] <+Sadira_snack_attack> victory is life?
[2:50:06] <Aiutare47> @Sp3ctre48 fair enough. I see what you mean.
[2:50:09] <%dudeitsray> thats cool as hell ma'am

[2:50:19] <%BlackStarAura> Bakara is so beautiful
[2:50:25] <stantheman_97> fun fact: the reason she wears that outfit is because they didn't havd a female krogan model
[2:50:31] <Pookiedaexzile> gotta pop a multi before you start
[2:50:33] <%dawarw0lf> Don’t show it tho
[2:50:33] <+redthebaron> her design is so cool
[2:50:34] <@commanderclaw> The Krogan are so fucking metal
[2:50:35] <cpt_langosta> *object not rendered*

[2:50:40] <%CalderGaming> THE KEY TO THE GURREN
[2:50:45] <%maenos2> i love how they frame the camera so you can't see and it looks like she's showing you her dick or something
[2:50:47] <DatAsuna> that sounds way too personal to just give away to someone you just met lol
[2:50:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> The male Krogan are a hurricane, while the female Krogan are the calm before the storm

[2:52:46] <%Shubreaker> this voice actress sounds familiar
[2:52:59] <tattleworm> it's so very clear that completely different writers handled the intro/ending and everything else
[2:53:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Shubreaker "What's the meaning of this interruption? Jarl Balgruff is not receiving visitors!"
[2:53:21] <M0untain_wolf> Yeah fuck you patriarchy
[2:53:24] <Flame_Water> what an amazing game to have a story line like this
[2:53:40] <viewtifulr> so they need to nut up to get the post rage calming

[2:54:45] <+alphonseisbest> @tattleworm 90% of the game was written by a team, the last 10% was written by one looking to please his higher up who wanted a certain endding for the games and then they had to meet a deadline
[2:55:02] <Pookiedaexzile> That was a office scene

[2:55:49] <M0untain_wolf> He is a science !

[2:55:52] <stantheman_97> very interesting insight

[2:56:08] <%peachy996> That's a hell of a pairing.
[2:56:08] <cpt_langosta> "Asari-Vorcah offspring have an alargy to dairy"
[2:56:09] <Aiutare47> Asari-vorcha offspring are allergic to dairy

[2:56:26] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Major Genral Song

[2:56:30] <akitanito> so asari vorchas are just asians?
[2:56:32] <tranquilturnip> Vorcha have a cursed existence
[2:56:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> What would a Vorchasari even sound like
[2:56:41] <%Shirousuke1989> ... I wonder what Mordin's opinion on Javik would be?
[2:56:42] <%Agami23> if eve and one of those purple people had a kid do you think the immune system would be so fucked up that nothing could kill them?
[2:56:45] <dekkitout> "WE DIED, WOMAN."
[2:56:46] <%James_Quivers> Javik: "My people were dumb as fuck"

[2:56:49] <viewtifulr> you idiots im saying traits like how you can tell when more has krogen
[2:56:50] <%peachy996> raspy
[2:56:51] <perfectharbinger> Didn't you already get this dialogue?
[2:56:54] <%Shirousuke1989> "HOLY SHIT PROTHEAN BIOLOGY!?"
[2:56:58] <Sp3ctre48> I love Liara slowly learning that the Protheans were space facists

[2:57:22] <hereiam407> Lol
[2:57:22] <%AzureGale> Excuses, excuses
[2:57:23] <dekkitout> Javik seems to struggle with the concept of "big picture"
[2:57:25] <cpt_langosta> wait, he DOES absorb edgelord energy?
[2:57:27] <+redthebaron> javik is a power makes might dude
[2:57:28] <%MidnightBurst12> sure buddy
[2:57:28] <@commanderclaw> Literal jarhead who fought a war his entire life and he's the only one still alive
[2:57:29] <@Ranryu692> Javik absorbed Grunt's splooge
[2:57:30] <FassieFons> mmm grunt residue
[2:57:31] <%AmericanSkidd> He found Grunts cummies
[2:57:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> The Protheans are just as barbaric and assholish as any other civilization or race. That's kind of the point
[2:57:34] <%Dakuu75> uhh...
[2:57:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He absorbs emotions
[2:57:38] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[2:57:38] <%count_bob> Gunt cummed all over the walls.

[2:57:44] <akitanito> pfft
[2:57:44] <%MightyDuckShoes> Grunt rubbed off on him
[2:57:47] <Sp3ctre48> He probably could though
[2:57:48] <DatAsuna> javik is very problematic
[2:57:50] <ErikFeral> This sounds like Vegeta
[2:57:50] <+alphonseisbest> based
[2:57:51] <SaltyAzteca> HE CAN'T WIN
[2:57:53] <@QueequegTheater> Javik that might not go how you think it will
[2:57:58] <cpt_langosta> DON'T LET HIM INTO JACOB'S ROOM HE'LL BECOME BORING
[2:57:58] <+PenmanLupine> Grunt grunted all over the ship
[2:58:00] <%peachy996> Yeah its kind of stupid isn't it Javik
[2:58:01] <+GuilKato> the solution is put Javik in the louge so he gets samara chill
[2:58:07] <+PenmanLupine> and its in Javiks skin now
[2:58:11] <%RJay80> mordin dont want to damage the goods
[2:58:13] <%peachy996> yes
[2:58:14] <%Shubreaker> yes
[2:58:14] <%lloyddboy> Yes
[2:58:16] <+RoByte2> He doesn't understand why your own species would fight you? He was fighting collectors!
[2:58:20] <%DrTomT18> I would say that Javik is a pragmatist.  He understands that this war hasn't even started yet. This is day one to him.
[2:58:21] <%HaroldDonchee> Javik knows de way
[2:58:21] <+alphonseisbest> @cpt_langosta FUCK U JACOB IS A TREASURE
[2:58:22] <DatAsuna> javik saying that kinda becomes stupid considering another conversation he has about his era
[2:58:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh! Did Pat pop a cap in Keiden yet?
[2:58:24] <Maids4lyfe> Javik had some funny dialogue if you brought him to the STG base
[2:58:28] <chainsaw105> Grum
[2:58:29] <%Ches_Neckbeard> just rolling around in Grunts jizz
[2:58:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> UGH
[2:58:31] <@QueequegTheater> BOOOOOO HISS
[2:58:31] <hereiam407> oh god
[2:58:34] <%James_Quivers> Javik wants to skip this whole game and jsut force everyone to play nice at gunpoint, and IMO? BASED.
[2:58:35] <%dawarw0lf> Javik is racist but he is also having Grunt time
[2:58:38] <+GuilKato> grunt was a teenager - so yeah there would be grunt juice everywhere
[2:58:39] <Pookiedaexzile> The EA room
[2:58:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> god, I hate her so fuckin much

[3:01:31] <dekkitout> Gun do good big
[3:01:32] <+GuilKato> i always liked the scorpion it was a fun gun
[3:01:32] <%BlackStarAura> Cortez?
[3:01:38] <%dawarw0lf> It has a damage mod on it
[3:01:40] <Aiutare47> they are the same gun really,
[3:01:44] <%James_Quivers> Only with that mod on
[3:01:44] <hereiam407> @MightyDuckShoes They have
[3:01:50] <perfectharbinger> No lol.
[3:01:50] <Mattais88> no damge mod on wraith
[3:01:53] <stormhawk9891> Eviscerator has mods equipped
[3:01:53] <Sp3ctre48> The Wraith is just the Eviscerator but good
[3:01:58] <%Scevda> DOUBLE BARREL THOUGH
[3:02:00] <%Monkeyweed21> its straight up worse
[3:02:00] <ExemplarKyle> Minus mods, the wraith is better
[3:02:08] <TheMostAverageGamer4> how much does weight actually affect gameplay?
[3:02:15] <%DrTomT18> Wraith does more damage
[3:02:16] <stormhawk9891> Mods
[3:02:19] <@goose_attack_almanac> @TheMostAverageGamer4 a lot actually if you use your abilities
[3:02:24] <%MightyDuckShoes> @hereiam407  Mother  of God... I never came across it then.
[3:02:25] <%DrTomT18> I hear the Crusader is good
[3:02:26] <Sp3ctre48> Weight affects your power cooldowns
[3:02:28] <%Retinolgaming> Wraith is a better gun, they just have similar stats.
[3:02:31] <@QueequegTheater> Crazy Talk just nerfed the Eviscerator in real time
[3:02:32] <%andrewofbob> @TheMostAverageGamer4 It significantly shifts how much you can rely on powers
[3:02:34] <%Alig200> @TheMostAverageGamer4 heavier weaponry makes your powers take longer to be used again
[3:02:41] <%Scevda> @themostaveragegamer4 depends on you your balance of power usage vs gun usage. Its a great system.
[3:02:43] <%James_Quivers> The Krogan shotgun is the msot based of all
[3:02:44] <$OranHexthief> wraith is just the N7 version of the eviscerator pat
[3:02:47] <stormhawk9891> @DrTomT18 Crusaders weird
[3:02:51] <+OneMoreCarlos> weigh affects power recharge speed @themostaveragegamer4
[3:02:53] <hereiam407> @MightyDuckShoes The cheeks on her face just don't look right
[3:02:54] <M0untain_wolf> Harpoon gun is drunk
[3:02:54] <Sp3ctre48> So you don't want heavy weapons on biotic classes
[3:02:57] <M0untain_wolf> but fun
[3:02:58] <Aiutare47> @TheMostAverageGamer4 depends on class and playstyle. If you arent running a power heavy class you can get away with more weight.
[3:03:00] <+condemned_15> get outta here stalker
[3:03:01] <JohnA83> How far is he?

[3:04:43] <chainsaw105> it makes a kind of "whumwhumwhumwhum" whereas the old Normandy was more of a "tkuhtkuhtkuhtkuh"

[3:04:55] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Fun fact, that line from James about the hum is a lynchpin of the Indoctrination Theory
[3:04:58] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Citadel DLC won't be for a hot minute
[3:04:58] <%andrewofbob> @TheMostAverageGamer4 It also has native penetration, so it's like a baby Black Widow with no scope

[3:06:48] <hereiam407> Does Tali wear the visor inside her helmet if you equip it?
[3:06:55] <williamrooster> no colour
[3:06:56] <%DrTomT18> you don't want power bonus, Pat?
[3:06:57] <+alphonseisbest> @QueequegTheater huh. always thought it was something more
[3:06:58] <ExemplarKyle> Space Hamster is the real MVP.
[3:06:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> Change color
[3:07:04] <%peachy996> You look like some dweeb in cosplay armor
[3:07:09] <BigYanno> as opposed to what?

[3:07:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Change the color so you can look even MORE like an asshole
[3:07:25] <+GuilKato> i pretty much always wore the collector armor because it looked cool
[3:07:25] <%dawarw0lf> You don’t need to worry about armor
[3:07:26] <28moogles> ... I like the Dragon Armor... lol
[3:07:26] <cpt_langosta> whos borking

[3:08:23] <%dawarw0lf> That’s the korgan team

[3:09:21] <TourettesPlays> Did I miss a lot of ME3 or did Pat spend an hour and a half talking about FRIENDS again?
[3:09:24] <stantheman_97> attican traverse is in between citadel space and terminus space

[3:15:20] <%za7az> Stream poison is best poison
[3:15:20] <%Dakuu75> Everyone: you need to get the stream poison. It's how you build an immunity.

[3:15:28] <%dukeofhammer> Good combo

[3:15:38] <%Monkeyweed21> sounds good
[3:15:40] <perfectharbinger> Javik and Garrus is solid.
[3:15:42] <%RealThiele> The Nontic dream game
[3:15:42] <%teefpal> I want the poison pat, put it in my viens
[3:15:46] <%dawarw0lf> Javik is good choice
[3:15:53] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> humankind is a stream i am into but that i acknowledge is going to do crap numbers
[3:15:55] <+GuilKato> I feel sorry for edi she gets a body asks to go into combat and then you dont take her to combat
[3:15:56] <blackjack8182> Yes
[3:15:56] <digaogrunge> 12 minutes looks dope
[3:16:05] <cpt_langosta> equip kruber
[3:16:08] <Dunmarkh> wall hack time
[3:16:12] <%peachy996> look how handsome garrus be
[3:16:13] <TourettesPlays> GOD GARRUS
[3:16:14] <@MistyMntns> I've heard good things about 12 Minutes
[3:16:16] <@Ranryu692> aw yeah, more penetration LUL
[3:16:18] <%RealThiele> LOBOT SHEPARD
[3:16:22] <DatAsuna> weakeneing armour and cover penetration is godlike
[3:16:22] <+redthebaron> 1 meter penetration on garrus
[3:16:32] <digaogrunge> COVER LUL
[3:16:32] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> garrus become god
[3:16:40] <DatAsuna> Javik is bugged and needs a mod to respec yes
[3:16:40] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> you can.
[3:16:43] <%NopeBadguy> You can't respec him?
[3:16:43] <%dawarw0lf> Maybe you can cheat Engine it?
[3:16:44] <@QueequegTheater> idk I never use him
[3:16:44] <tattleworm> pretty sure you can respec everyone at the medbay
[3:16:44] <%andrewofbob> If you want to swap, you need to reset
[3:16:44] <TourettesPlays> Buy respec in med bay
[3:16:47] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, you can't reset Javik for some reason.
[3:16:49] <tattleworm> oh my bad
[3:16:49] <alrobot2014> did pat see that garrus becoming god video?
[3:16:49] <cpt_langosta> Javik is a stinky baby and refuses to let you change him
[3:16:55] <%JoshManVGH> Change what?
[3:16:56] <perfectharbinger> You can't respec Javik.
[3:16:56] <%homelesstwinky> the armor piercing actually countering the cover system is great
[3:16:58] <DatAsuna> He's not in the medbay menu
[3:16:58] <$StrawberryPantsu> He is a bug lol
[3:16:58] <olaksi> bugged, get it
[3:17:02] <%Shubreaker> you get one respec
[3:17:03] <@Ranryu692> We tried to tell you to pick recharge speed
[3:17:05] <TourettesPlays> @perfectharbinger lmao cool more bugs they just didnt patch
[3:17:07] <%Solid_Stro> He must still have that DLC dna in him
[3:17:10] <%JoshManVGH> Oh, bawls
[3:17:10] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> he's bugged 🐛
[3:17:15] <FassieFons> respec-ing is not the prothean way
[3:17:27] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> is that only LE? I remember being able to do it in the original.
[3:17:32] <DatAsuna> Yeah shepard giving squadmates ammo kinda conflicts with them bringing their own
[3:17:38] <Aiutare47> Garrus now has a light machine gun that shoots through walls and never misses.
[3:17:49] <perfectharbinger> Ammo capacity on ammo powers is actually really good for Shepard.
[3:17:51] <$realm_forge> What’s the better insult for Javik? Four eyes or forehead?
[3:18:04] <SaltyAzteca> your eyes look weird!
[3:18:07] <%NopeBadguy> GOOD TO HEAR THEY KILLED THOSE BATARIANS
[3:18:09] <wasdsf> then put a helmet on?
[3:18:10] <Garry_Guyface> @realm_forge water bug
[3:18:14] <%JoshManVGH> I've been using slam with incendiary ammo, for hilarious firebomb spikes.
[3:18:22] <DatAsuna> @Ranryu692 I still say nah, his recharge speed is plenty high and damage feeds into base damage which increases the multiplier for combos
[3:18:23] <%AmericanSkidd> holy shit
[3:18:23] <%James_Quivers> RACHNI BEEN AROUND FOREVER DUDE
[3:18:25] <%akscully> protheans suck
[3:18:31] <%dukeofhammer> Yup
[3:18:32] <ExemplarKyle> Casual genocide
[3:18:33] <Sp3ctre48> Thank you for your input Javik
[3:18:34] <Profmcstevie> NO WONDER YOU LOST
[3:18:34] <%miguelrod777> rachni are also super durable for some reason
[3:18:37] <wasdsf> the protheans did nothing wrong
[3:18:38] <DatAsuna> rachni roll deep
[3:18:39] <cpt_langosta> Jeez, Javik
[3:18:39] <dekkitout> That doesn't merit a response, Jav
[3:18:41] <+Buzzkill983> Protheans: If they resist, they get the stick

[3:19:05] <%Solid_Stro> Turns out the Protheans broke a lot of eggs to make an omelette, because they’re terrible cooks
[3:19:06] <@Ranryu692> I love how hyped he is to see you
[3:19:06] <%dukeofhammer> My baby boy!!!

[3:19:12] <santafer> PAPA
[3:19:15] <%BlackStarAura> I LOVE HIM
[3:19:27] <+rafaelba93> grunt looks next gen
[3:19:31] <cpt_langosta> for some reason, grunt always reminds me of sour gummy worms...
[3:19:37] <%RealThiele> turns out noone actually cared about the batarians
[3:19:53] <%OrangeMDT> Isn’t he like 15?
[3:19:55] <hereiam407> What's a Bavarian? Never heard of one
[3:19:58] <+cermo55> @RealThiele cause they died
[3:19:59] <ape_hawk> @RealThiele i mean, they ARE space north korea
[3:20:02] <%JoshManVGH> And Killed the thresher maw!
[3:20:05] <SaltyAzteca> he
[3:20:06] <Pookiedaexzile> HE"S A GENETIC FREAK
[3:20:06] <+Buzzkill983> Batarians have literally not changed from being assholes over millenia
[3:20:11] <%RealThiele> LUL
[3:20:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mah booooi
[3:20:21] <SaltyAzteca> he fought a maw. Damn right he's respected
[3:20:24] <Parapattern> He likes Sharks and Dinosaurs
[3:20:26] <%miguelrod777> @orangemdt  he's younger he was born fully grown he's like one
[3:20:26] <%peachy996> He's hype
[3:20:26] <Sp3ctre48> The Batarians are basically an endangered species now and literally no one cares, it's so weird LUL
[3:20:28] <cpt_langosta> @OrangeMDT he's like 3 or 4
[3:20:33] <$realm_forge> Is it weird that I really want to touch Grunt’s face?
[3:20:38] <zerointelligence000> I took your room bro
[3:20:45] <%AmericanSkidd> LUL
[3:20:47] <%andrewofbob> Hearing a lot of Rytlock Brimstone in this voice performance
[3:20:48] <hereiam407> He's harassing my buzz she shep
[3:20:48] <%AzureGale> LUL
[3:20:58] <dekkitout> Shep, who's this fkn boomer?
[3:21:04] <Pookiedaexzile> "You Grunt you into older Women
[3:21:12] <Zombrocom> Grunt's like: "What the fuck is that thing?"
[3:21:14] <TourettesPlays> Grunt would totally want to kill Javik just so he could say he drove the Prothean race to extinction
[3:21:16] <%Shubreaker> grunt: BOOMER DETECTED
[3:21:17] <+hybridcode7> The Brogan
[3:21:18] <28moogles> JUST LIKE OLD TIMES
[3:21:18] <AngryAsian5> It's like you rented your son's room out to an asshole LUL
[3:21:20] <stormhawk9891> IT'S GREAT
[3:21:20] <%RealThiele> we unfroze Red Skull grunt, oops
[3:21:21] <+NeonLight> heh heh heh
[3:21:22] <%dukeofhammer> Theres a lot
[3:21:22] <DatAsuna> and this is technically a sidequest
[3:21:24] <santafer> heh heh heh
[3:21:25] <%DrTomT18> There are hundreds of possible outcomes lol
[3:21:26] <Mattais88> It's kind of crazy
[3:21:27] <%Birdigalore> Woooah neck broke there
[3:21:28] <%James_Quivers> It really highlights how they was BARELY ANY in 2
[3:21:28] <+D00msDayDan> imagine passing up all these interactions to bring along, like, jacob or something
[3:21:29] <%dawarw0lf> How many times does garrus say “just like old times” it’s like half his dialogue
[3:21:29] <+Buzzkill983> The smaller party really helped them focus dialogue
[3:21:31] <hereiam407> Breeding camps were asking about you shep shep
[3:21:33] <%barrakuta371> It's why chat is always arguing who to bring
[3:21:34] <wasdsf> makes it worth replaying just to see all the dialogue
[3:21:34] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Old times were like 6 months ago, right? LUL
[3:21:34] <%peachy996> That's why Chat was insistent on Javik before
[3:21:37] <@Ranryu692> it's worth re-playing ME3 just for the other dialogue alone
[3:21:39] <%homelesstwinky> thats the great part about not having 12 of them to write for
[3:21:41] <%teefpal> A lot of it is reused or repurposed
[3:21:46] <%robuttastic> garrus especially since hes been with us all trilogy
[3:21:48] <santafer> Normandy has the best party in all games
[3:21:50] <%dawarw0lf> It’s heavy
[3:21:52] <+Goraka91> Aw baby
[3:21:54] <+redthebaron> like it is kinda insane how many lines everyone has
[3:21:55] <%James_Quivers> This is the benefit of the small crewmate size, really
[3:21:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> MMMMmmm
[3:21:58] <%peachy996> Not just the salarians thing but they disregard the last prothean as a genetic plastic surgery thing
[3:21:58] <dekkitout> BEEG
[3:21:58] <blackjack8182> Shotgun
[3:21:58] <ExemplarKyle> OUR BABY
[3:21:59] <%RealThiele> Javik as DLC is 110% shitty EA
[3:22:00] <santafer> can't wait for the r the Citadel DLC
[3:22:02] <+RyanTheRecluse> Ol bessy is back
[3:22:02] <Garry_Guyface> We'll bang ok
[3:22:05] <Jaysky> ME3 can also be played through pretty quickly
[3:22:07] <%JoshManVGH> Heavy as shit
[3:22:07] <%GarbageNirvana> Hello gorgeous
[3:22:10] <DatAsuna> See when reviewers said the sidequests in ME3 sucked it's because they forget that stuff like this is sidequests
[3:22:13] <ExemplarKyle> It's SO. GODDAMN. HEAVY THOUGH.
[3:22:18] <perfectharbinger> Finally getting that Clussy.
[3:22:24] <%hatok> you're going to get an INCREDIBLY specific piece of dialog for Tali later based on several of your choices
[3:22:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Best Party in all Games is a Spoiler
[3:22:37] <dekkitout> They are just built different, Jav
[3:22:37] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:22:38] <Pookiedaexzile> :)
[3:22:41] <%Deft_Thought> Three whole videogames worth
[3:22:42] <%DrTomT18> Javik might be an ass hole but he is usually right
[3:22:43] <$Faustgesicht> Makes sense tho
[3:22:47] <hereiam407> Prefab buildings are common in space
[3:22:48] <DatAsuna> prefabs are handy
[3:22:50] <+PenmanLupine> you know, they say that all Krogan are created equal, but you look at Grunt and you look at Warlord Okeer and you can see that statement is not true!
[3:22:52] <Sp3ctre48> I'm really down on ME3 for more reasons than just the ending but the interaction between it's characters is some of the best i've seen in a rpg
[3:22:54] <+ryuguitarfreak> Javik will absolutely NEVER calm down
[3:22:55] <cpt_langosta> javik is peak boomer: fucked up the galaxy, then sticks around to complain about how people these days aren't solving his problems right
[3:22:59] <%RealThiele> gotta put people into space somehow
[3:22:59] <%Monkeyweed21> A POSE
[3:23:03] <DatAsuna> @hereiam407 and just real life too lol
[3:23:06] <Goatllama> It's heavy. And long. And gonna pump you full of hot lead!
[3:23:07] <alrobot2014> they learned how to reuse boxes from ME1
[3:23:09] <%Puhff> yeah it's almost as if the level design is terrible!
[3:23:10] <%GarbageNirvana> That's what prefabs are for, set em up anywhere
[3:23:16] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Weapon bench in the building behind you btw if you wanna try the Claymore
[3:23:18] <%NopeBadguy> That one Krogan had his arms crossed so tight I thought he was armless
[3:23:22] <Pookiedaexzile> KWO
[3:23:38] <%RealThiele> and by we he meant you grunt
[3:23:39] <stormhawk9891> Fair enough
[3:23:40] <hereiam407> @DatAsuna my school had too many for too long
[3:23:42] <RiverBirch> Grunt has nice eyes...
[3:23:49] <%Puhff> I love krogan hemets
[3:23:51] <QuestlordJake> his fucking BLOOD demands it
[3:23:52] <Aiutare47> also reload canceling in 3 is quicker than in 2, so the claymore is even better
[3:23:54] <hereiam407> He's beautiful
[3:23:55] <QuestlordJake> metal
[3:23:57] <Pookiedaexzile> That guy without the mask must have a story
[3:24:10] <+chuckthecanuck> wow your shepard looks like shit lmao
[3:24:12] <Goatllama> I want to pull on those scaly cheeks
[3:24:25] <Jaysky> Mistakes? Not perfect
[3:24:26] <Sp3ctre48> not really though
[3:24:27] <Sol_Install> why are all korgan allies cool?
[3:24:27] <%Sartastic> Shepard.
[3:24:29] <thewhiterice92> DID YOU SEE SHEPARD'S BODY FREAK OUT WHEN THE CONVO ENDED?
[3:24:31] <28moogles> Mass Effect has a good cast.
[3:24:34] <+PenmanLupine> See normally when you go 1 on 1 with another Krogan, you got a 50/50 chance to win it! BUT GRUNTS A GENETIC FREAK!
[3:24:34] <Parapattern> Give your large son a kiss on his giant ass forehead
[3:24:36] <wasdsf> bumbleking shepard
[3:24:37] <%Puhff> Jebaited
[3:24:37] <Pookiedaexzile> An Uncharted
[3:24:38] <perfectharbinger> I'm pretty sure the krogan without a mask replaces Grunt if he dies.
[3:24:39] <%RealThiele> KHorne sheds an approving tear
[3:24:39] <%demiiluna> "Don't make it weird, Shepard."
[3:24:43] <+Goraka91> Imagine
[3:24:45] <%James_Quivers> It's an involitary response
[3:24:46] <M0untain_wolf> Yep
[3:24:48] <+Goraka91> IMAGINE
[3:24:48] <%twistedj3ster> yes
[3:24:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[3:24:48] <%NopeBadguy> You're making me regret not bringing Javik to things but Singularity from Liara is just too good
[3:24:49] <hereiam407> It's the future
[3:24:52] <godzookylives> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:24:52] <M0untain_wolf> Best
[3:24:53] <28moogles> I get it
[3:24:53] <%twistedj3ster> I'd love it
[3:24:55] <%homelesstwinky> how ridiculous
[3:24:56] <%Deft_Thought> Still better than the ME3 Ending
[3:24:57] <JunkyardCrow> Kirk LUL
[3:24:58] <williamrooster> it be very poetic
[3:24:59] <+redthebaron> shepard canon death being this would rule
[3:25:00] <%peachy996> Indignified?
[3:25:00] <notsoy> it would piss off so many fans
[3:25:00] <%teefpal> LUL
[3:25:00] <Conscript_Gary> lmao
[3:25:01] <cpt_langosta> Grunt buried him under rocks. It's only a matter of time... before the wolves come.
[3:25:01] <Jaysky> Would suck wouldn't it
[3:25:01] <%Puhff> shepard fell on a rock up his ass and died
[3:25:01] <%AmericanSkidd> oops his brain broke
[3:25:02] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Like Tarkus.
[3:25:02] <Alzero83> cause all these characters are lovable @PatStaresAt
[3:25:02] <Mattais88> Watched generations recently?
[3:25:03] <hairtoday> he's gotta die one the bridge, right?
[3:25:03] <%Rumbutt> oroLUL
[3:25:03] <wasdsf> WHAT A TERRIBLE IDEA, I WOULD NEVER PUT THAT IN A MOVIE
[3:25:04] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL
[3:25:04] <Ardailec> Who is bit referencing?
[3:25:05] <TourettesPlays> Wait are you talking about Han Solo or Kirk????
[3:25:06] <LunarRemix> What are you talking about

[3:30:40] <ExemplarKyle> Wouldn't be the first time the Reapers took control of a hive mind.
[3:30:45] <hereiam407> These songs won't be pretty
[3:30:47] <%RealThiele> WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?
[3:30:51] <zerointelligence000> The reaper enemy types are so cool but they feel so underused throughout the series
[3:30:52] <%walternatorz> I hated that so much
[3:30:54] <Sp3ctre48> The mortal enemies of bad vanguards in the MP Keepo
[3:30:58] <%strakillias> Why did they put wall arms in this room?
[3:30:58] <%peachy996> Reaper Mosquitoes
[3:30:59] <+archangel9889> they become drones either way Pat
[3:30:59] <+D00msDayDan> if you killed the rachni queen this mission would happen anyway

[3:32:00] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt We'll explain later
[3:32:02] <Jaysky> FFS
[3:32:04] <blackjack8182> Clone
[3:32:04] <%Scevda> Hmmmmm Pat hmmmm
[3:32:05] <%DrTomT18> or not
[3:32:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they clone a rachni breeder
[3:32:06] <%Rumbutt> It didn't matter
[3:32:10] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “Your choices matter” was BS
[3:32:10] <+RyanTheRecluse> a clone queen
[3:32:12] <Maids4lyfe> the clones are worse
[3:32:13] <%snow_bush> Your choice "Matters"
[3:32:15] <blackjack8182> Super lazy
[3:32:16] <%SovPho> the reapers develop retcon tech
[3:32:17] <1faber> it has a health bar, garrus
[3:32:19] <+Goraka91> Also chat don't say shit
[3:32:21] <%peachy996> It's stupid. They should have just taken the enemy out if you didn't save the Rachni
[3:32:24] <LunarRemix> They haven't made those 3D models for you to not see them
[3:32:24] <Pookiedaexzile> and In the end it didn't even matter
[3:32:24] <tanarath> They clone an evil queen
[3:32:26] <M0untain_wolf> What if GUN
[3:32:29] <wasdsf> WHAT
[3:32:29] <hereiam407> You can't save everyone
[3:32:31] <+beansoup> Garrus
[3:32:31] <%dawarw0lf> Your choice does matter but we can explain latwr
[3:32:32] <AthenaAegis> lol
[3:32:33] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:32:35] <Shade075> LUL
[3:32:35] <perfectharbinger> Well your choice actually does matter at the end of this mission depending on if you saved the Rachni or not.
[3:32:35] <Sp3ctre48> It's like Bioware always wants you to pick the Paragon choices or something lmao
[3:32:36] <ExemplarKyle> "Yo dawg, we heard you don't like rachni, so we invalidated your choice and you get to still kill rachni."
[3:32:37] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> jank

[3:41:48] <+Goraka91> It is :)
[3:41:49] <@QueequegTheater> It is
[3:41:50] <Mattais88> It is
[3:41:50] <DatAsuna> It is
[3:41:50] <%DrTomT18> you can ignore it
[3:41:50] <%Retinolgaming> It is LUL
[3:41:51] <%peachy996> it is
[3:41:51] <%teefpal> It is
[3:41:52] <williamrooster> it is
[3:41:53] <%castlerock42> It is.
[3:41:54] <%dukeofhammer> It is!
[3:41:54] <zerointelligence000> I think it still is
[3:41:54] <%dawarw0lf> This is a “side mission”
[3:41:54] <mattynezz> it is
[3:41:54] <MarylandJutsu> I love you grunt
[3:41:56] <ShiningAxis> It is a side mission.
[3:41:56] <+redthebaron> it is
[3:41:59] <1faber> grunt's gonna slip on a banana peel for that one
[3:41:59] <SaltyAzteca> thats a good line
[3:41:59] <HeroToxiko> ye grunt
[3:42:00] <%Rumbutt> it's a side mission the way loyalty missions are
[3:42:01] <DatAsuna> It's just a GOOD side mission
[3:42:02] <Latija> this is like grissom
[3:42:04] <%James_Quivers> the side missions in this game are ACTUAL MISSIONS tho
[3:42:06] <%DrTomT18> you can ignore a lot of side missions and completely fuck your self
[3:42:08] <Profmcstevie> Fewer side content, more polish
[3:42:16] <ape_hawk> B A D A N A S
[3:42:16] <%hatok> there's basically no difference in budget between main and side missions unless they're N7 missions
[3:42:18] <%SovPho> b-a-n-d-a-n-a-s
[3:42:19] <M0untain_wolf> But grunt and qween
[3:42:21] <%DrTomT18> like, that mission with Victius' son? You can ignore that
[3:42:21] <Aiutare47> this series is full of super important damn near critical stuff you can skip or miss
[3:42:24] <williamrooster> you can do priority tuchanka right away
[3:42:25] <@QueequegTheater> Damage
[3:42:26] <TourettesPlays> Pat chain overload is really OP
[3:42:28] <Latija> headshot
[3:42:29] <%count_bob> headshot
[3:42:29] <%andrewofbob> ME3 side missions are just as good as the main missions
[3:42:30] <M0untain_wolf> Ammo
[3:42:31] <MarylandJutsu> look at that LOW level shockwave
[3:42:34] <%peachy996> You have a shotgun
[3:42:34] <dekkitout> Can you hit your shots?
[3:42:34] <cpt_langosta> Banderas?
[3:42:35] <anAngryHamster> Do these things even have heads?
[3:42:35] <DatAsuna> you're not running out of ammo like ever anyway lol
[3:42:38] <%ZephynM> So I remember Pat once talking about seeing things in grocery stores like people stealing food or whatevers. I've seen a lot of that in the past week where I work.
[3:42:39] <Mattais88> Ammos everywhere
[3:42:40] <%DrTomT18> You shouldn;t, but you can
[3:42:40] <mattynezz> Headshot, you never run out of ammo
[3:42:43] <KnightOfTrousers> You use shotguns, I'd say ammo
[3:42:46] <HeroToxiko> that was the year of the mandatory "optional" sidequest
[3:42:47] <M0untain_wolf> i mean okaayy
[3:42:48] <%peachy996> Are you sure you're gonna make those shots to the head
[3:42:51] <@QueequegTheater> Baby shockwave for baby gamer Kappa
[3:43:00] <%walternatorz> aren't you required to hit the headshot, pat?

[3:45:02] <+Troispoint> Old baby
[3:45:32] <%ZephynM> @DatAsuna Why would the manager yell at an old lady for not being able to catch a guy running? That's horrible.
[3:45:34] <%dawarw0lf> Pull is a primer
[3:45:34] <MarylandJutsu> babyyyy grandpa hes the very best
[3:45:37] <Jaysky> @DatAsuna My workplace would get mad if we did try to chase cause it means we could get injured and that's a big no no
[3:45:41] <%DrTomT18> Pull only worked on normal enemies that do not have armor or shield up
[3:45:44] <%AzureGale> HrrraaAAAAA
[3:45:49] <cpt_langosta> jesus, joel

[3:47:31] <Gruhunchously> Gotta say, the segmented health system this game uses is really cool and I'm actually surprised more cover based games don't use it

[3:50:08] <%miguelrod777> they are both sensitive to the indoctrination but also resistant to it
[3:50:08] <%andrewofbob> The best option is to stick with your decision on Novaria - spare the queen
[3:50:14] <QuestlordJake> moon2H
[3:50:14] <%BlackStarAura> She is a major war asset
[3:50:15] <+GuilKato> help queen!
[3:50:16] <Badgerconda_> surely this can only end well. right?

[3:50:19] <kingra> Help her :(
[3:50:20] <SaltyAzteca> ALIEN QUEEN

[3:50:30] <hereiam407> Free the queen
[3:50:34] <+senfood> Based queen!
[3:50:38] <ExemplarKyle> She's a mother scorned. Imagine a rachni army at your disposal.
[3:50:38] <Profmcstevie> If something that big gets indoctrinated...
[3:50:38] <HeroToxiko> YEAH
[3:50:42] <tyrano_the_wise> yaay

[3:51:12] <Zombrocom> Grunt'll be fine
[3:51:12] <%TheQuadrupleS> You killed Grunts team

[3:51:35] <mattynezz> she's still covered in gamer LEDs
[3:51:38] <Gruhunchously> I do like the contrast between the asari in ME1 with the krogan in this
[3:51:38] <hereiam407> I just hope she figures out how to make rachni that aren't fucked up
[3:51:39] <+destro_223> Grunt just lost his whole team BibleThump
[3:51:43] <+GuilKato> because hes grunt

[3:51:46] <wasdsf> @cpt_langosta he's just that cool
[3:51:47] <%andrewofbob> On the other hand, the clone queen kills all your engineers

[3:53:39] <mattynezz> Ye
[3:53:39] <zerointelligence000> loyalty is a hell of a drug

[3:53:42] <Mcjiggyjay> yeah
[3:53:43] <santafer> yep
[3:53:43] <viewtifulr> Grunt like Zoro from thriller Bark
[3:53:44] <@goose_attack_almanac> Grunt is covered in acid

[3:53:49] <%akscully> yes, you taught him to live, laugh love
[3:53:50] <Alzero83> no
[3:53:50] <digaogrunge> YEP
[3:53:50] <hereiam407> It is complicated Hackett
[3:53:52] <%andrewofbob> ME3 has a fair number of loyalty checks
[3:53:54] <%ZephynM> Grunt "Rachni Slayer" Badass has returned.
[3:53:54] <%dudeitsray> tears
[3:53:56] <Gelphaze> FUCK YEA HE LIVES!
[3:53:56] <Goatllama> well that was dumb as hell
[3:53:57] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> yep
[3:53:57] <Gruhunchously> We got burned because she got indoctrinated
[3:53:58] <chainsaw105> time to eat some noodles and crash a C-SEC car
[3:54:00] <%BlackStarAura> LOVE YOU GRUNT
[3:54:00] <%DrTomT18> If you take the clone you get fucked super hard
[3:54:02] <+daedazrael> If he’s not loyal he dies
[3:54:05] <+GuilKato> Grunt son is best son
[3:54:06] <Alzero83> loyalty means nothing in the outcome here
[3:54:08] <fauxmachine> HACK IT OUT
[3:54:08] <KokiriKid07> How, she did nothing wrong until getting corrupted
[3:54:11] <%Ches_Neckbeard> the Rachni are totally going to help this time for real no really
[3:54:12] <+redthebaron> shepard is out here doing some wild deals
[3:54:15] <%AmericanSkidd> God Grunt is such a badass
[3:54:16] <%BlackStarAura> OUR BEAUTIFUL SON
[3:54:17] <@ssjklyco> Grunt is best ME character
[3:54:35] <%Dakuu75> the fight was intense, I had to save scum so hard. What? Nothing.
[3:54:35] <Gruhunchously> My Krogan son
[3:54:39] <@ssjklyco> His arm isn't loaded
[3:54:44] <@ssjklyco> never mind
[3:54:48] <hereiam407> Grunt will fight you for the throne
[3:54:56] <SaltyAzteca> few scratches
[3:55:01] <Gruhunchously> If a krogan doesn't end the day covered in acid and blood, is he really a krogan?
[3:55:04] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:55:07] <+destro_223> Uncle Urdnot
[3:55:07] <%peachy996> Grunt is another one that annoys me he doesnt join up later
[3:55:13] <%MelBrooksKA> It's a flesh wound
[3:55:15] <dekkitout> You can fix their dicks!
[3:55:16] <Gruhunchously> They changed Mordin's VA for this didn't they?
[3:55:20] <Jaysky> As fast as his collector bee research
[3:55:27] <@QueequegTheater> @Gruhunchously no
[3:55:31] <+RowenCleric> Goldlewis wants to cure the genophage
[3:55:43] <+Buzzkill983> Ah the McGuffin
[3:55:48] <+condemned_15> giant penus
[3:55:56] <Flame_Water> i think we all hate this mission
[3:55:56] <Shockmaster182> @gruhunchously He’s voiced by the dude who  does rigby and doc ock
[3:55:56] <+condemned_15> pingas
[3:56:01] <santafer> oops
[3:56:02] <dekkitout> tajWHY
[3:56:07] <%Piemono> Devious and Clever are like the same thing
[3:56:07] <mattynezz> There's a mod for original ME3 that adds Grunt to squad selection. Along with Wrex and a couple others
[3:56:09] <%DrTomT18> What if no Krogan were on the planet when the Genophage was activated? What if they never returned? Would they just not have it?
[3:56:13] <santafer> awkward
[3:56:18] <SaltyAzteca> how ironic
[3:56:19] <%toastybites> Mordin "War crime boring science now"
[3:56:22] <MarylandJutsu> @QueequegTheater actuallly yeah its a dif VA for Mordin
[3:56:24] <%Foopoof> oh shii, undo the warcrimve time?
[3:56:28] <%Dakuu75> I can't believe in 3 games. the genophage is STILL a huge plot point
[3:56:33] <%Shubreaker> KEITH
[3:56:37] <HeroToxiko> @DrTomT18 yup
[3:56:38] <zerointelligence000> talk to dad
[3:56:41] <Gruhunchously> I'm honestly surprised that this massive tower survived this long on Tuchanka without getting blown up
[3:56:41] <KokiriKid07> Hey space dad how's earth
[3:56:43] <%Shubreaker> snapcubeKeith
[3:56:43] <%peachy996> @DrTomT18 Well all the females are on Tuchanka
[3:56:47] <%AmericanSkidd> LUL
[3:56:47] <+Troispoint> The way Mordin 180s from creating the genophage doesn't add up imo
[3:56:48] <IvanMistwalker> dad
[3:56:53] <AngryAsian5> HI SPACE DAD
[3:56:53] <@ssjklyco> The key to winning the war. A giant Krogan sex party
[3:56:55] <stantheman_97> i really like his resistance outfit
[3:56:55] <+DracosMagala> GOLIATH
[3:56:58] <+destro_223> Papa Anderson
[3:57:00] <IvanMistwalker> space dad
[3:57:01] <%Scevda> Please dont call him andy
[3:57:05] <@QueequegTheater> @Troispoint He didn't create the genophage.
[3:57:11] <hereiam407> @Troispoint He knows they are needed to fight the reapers
[3:57:14] <%GarbageNirvana> That was in a book
[3:57:15] <%JohnAtDawn> GOD KIETH DAVID IS SO GOOD
[3:57:15] <MarylandJutsu> oh myyyyy
[3:57:16] <cpt_langosta> they're parsecs apart. his dick can't be that big.
[3:57:18] <SaltyAzteca> SPACE SPAWN
[3:57:19] <+senfood> OH THEY FUCKIN
[3:57:19] <ape_hawk> yeaaaaaaaaaah, they held hands once
[3:57:20] <wasdsf> "He was evil back then too."
[3:57:20] <%Dakuu75> they FUCKED~!!!
[3:57:24] <Gruhunchously> @Troispoint Yeah it sadly feels a little underdeveloped
[3:57:29] <%ospreyworks> Keith David is a king.
[3:57:30] <+destro_223> C L A P dem cheeks
[3:57:30] <Shatterthought> @Troispoint if you push him hard enough with Renegade you get his reasoning
[3:57:32] <+Troispoint> @QueequegTheater pretty sure he was on the team that created it
[3:57:34] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Anderson hadx flexiblity
[3:57:39] <SaltyAzteca> OH THEY CALIBRATIN
[3:57:44] <+redthebaron> anderson is gonna get it
[3:57:47] <%LeiaSkynoober> I love Anderson so much
[3:57:50] <hereiam407> No just dancin
[3:57:50] <%miguelrod777> go get em dad
[3:57:51] <%Foopoof> @Troispoint mordin and his subordinate starts the 180, but yea i agreee. it feels like we missed somethjing
[3:57:54] <Sp3ctre48> Mordin going through that change offscreen is the problem I think
[3:57:56] <@QueequegTheater> @Troispoint The genophage is two thousand years old, Mordin is 43
[3:57:59] <Aiutare47> @Troispoint it was created a thousand years ago, he was on the team the modified it so it still worked
[3:58:03] <IvanMistwalker> love you space dad
[3:58:03] <chainsaw105> he has reach, she has flexibility
[3:58:04] <MarylandJutsu> Montreal is now a sinkhole
[3:58:07] <akitanito> montreal's first one to cede
[3:58:08] <+Goraka91> Quebec is a blazing firestorm
[3:58:08] <%Dakuu75> Welcome to Space Canada, eh?
[3:58:09] <DatAsuna> the reaoers got quebec first
[3:58:09] <Sp3ctre48> @Troispoint They modified the cure not created it
[3:58:12] <Badgerconda_> even the reapers don't want to be around the quebecois, Pat.
[3:58:15] <@ssjklyco> They  stopped the reapers with road construction
[3:58:17] <%James_Quivers> Montreal ain't worth the reapers effort
[3:58:19] <%shurtal> FUCK NON
[3:58:19] <+DracosMagala> What about Edmonton?
[3:58:21] <Gruhunchously> Also, I don't really get what Anderson is trying to do on Earth. How have the Reapers not just obliterated everything by now?
[3:58:22] <Dunmarkh> man I hope the reapers got quebec
[3:58:23] <cpt_langosta> montreal was already indoctrinated before the war. french, y'know?
[3:58:23] <+Troispoint> oh ok that's what I got mixed up @Aiutare47
[3:58:24] <SaltyAzteca> SPACE CANADA NOO
[3:58:25] <TourettesPlays> @Troispoint no MOrdin was on the team that would modify the genophage every few years as the Krogan became immune to it
[3:58:26] <KokiriKid07> Canada is probably fine don't worry
[3:58:27] <@QueequegTheater> "Montreal is gone, so nothing of value has been lost yet"
[3:58:27] <%greasypete00> as far as I'm concerned if Vancouver got fucked Vancouver Island probably didn't do well either
[3:58:28] <%Solid_Stro> The Reapers are using Montreal as a base of operations actually
[3:58:28] <@goose_attack_almanac> Yo Toronto got fucked I bet
[3:58:28] <%Scevda> Montreal was dead before the reapers came
[3:58:30] <TheAntiNihilist> naw they were big traitors
[3:58:31] <Mattais88> Maybe it got hit like in Gundam?
[3:58:46] <TourettesPlays> @Gruhunchously the answer is shut up
[3:58:47] <%peachy996> The constant construction is stifling the Reapers efforts in Montreal
[3:58:53] <HeroToxiko> didn't montreal become new new york tho?
[3:58:57] <Shade075> MOTIVATED
[3:59:01] <+Goraka91> Space is big
[3:59:03] <Profmcstevie> The protheans were armed well
[3:59:05] <%Dakuu75> Oh, I thought it was instant, like Halo
[3:59:06] <%AmericanSkidd> at least
[3:59:06] <DatAsuna> every hole and every cave
[3:59:07] <%DrTomT18> the Prothans were also fucked right from the start, they didn't have the Citidal
[3:59:07] <Jaysky> It's a matter of HOW fucked
[3:59:07] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah it's not Halo
[3:59:11] <Aiutare47> because they have to harvest every single sapient in the entire galaxy
[3:59:11] <hereiam407> A lot of planets, a lot of gorund
[3:59:13] <Sp3ctre48> The Reapers are trying to harvest the populace so I guess they aren't just glassing the planet like they could be
[3:59:13] <%AzureGale> Yeah the logistics are weird
[3:59:13] <%miguelrod777> the Galaxy is wide
[3:59:15] <%Scevda> @peachy996 they didnt pay their invasion permits
[3:59:19] <%Deft_Thought> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaSkelmo
[3:59:20] <alrobot2014> yeah no 7 hour wars happening here
[3:59:22] <cpt_langosta> *Reaper looks at Earth* Now I'm motivated.
[3:59:26] <digaogrunge> SPACE BIG
[3:59:26] <%MrMegaJackpots> it looks worse than it is
[3:59:31] <TourettesPlays> There's a shit ton of unoccupied land mass on Earth, all reapers do is wipe out planets they're good at it
[3:59:33] <zerointelligence000> it's one-sided but not sudden
[3:59:35] <Gruhunchously> But like, all Anderson and his crew is dong is not dying - I can't really see them doing anything to even slow the Reapers down
[3:59:35] <KeystoneA2> Javik says it took that long because they took the Soviet approach of throwing legions of people for every yard lost
[3:59:35] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt why dont they just blow up the planets
[3:59:36] <dekkitout> *He says while I look at my poster scaling the earth to the sun*
[3:59:36] <stantheman_97> actually it's probably decades to get tiny pockets of resistance and people hiding in bunkers
[3:59:39] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah I like that little fact a lot actually. Reapers are dangerous, but they too are limited by their size and scale
[3:59:39] <Jaysky> Definitely not instant. It would be instant if the Reapers wanted to destroy the planets, but they do not evidently.
[3:59:40] <%Foopoof> fookin spooders
[3:59:40] <+Buzzkill983> If they were going Covenant, it would be faster, but they want all that human goo
[3:59:42] <%James_Quivers> once the opposing force is small enough to go guerilla, the time to full extermination expands dramatically
[3:59:44] <%Shubreaker> the prothens were also much more advanced and spread out
[3:59:44] <%hax_metatron> Mass Effect needs more Jojo energy honestly
[3:59:45] <@QueequegTheater> "It's odd, the people in Chicago aren't even running away when the Reapers shot at them, it's like they're used to it or something."
[3:59:46] <%dukeofhammer> yup
[3:59:46] <%DrTomT18> weird that you don't get Rachni warriors
[3:59:46] <%JohnAtDawn> YEP LUL
[3:59:47] <kingra> Based
[3:59:47] <%dawarw0lf> They won’t betray you
[3:59:48] <perfectharbinger> I really like that the Reapers focus on the heavy populated areas first because *of course* they would.
[3:59:50] <%Solid_Stro> Gotta send a lot of Husks into holes to finish the 1% of survivors
[3:59:51] <%akscully> all that chittering
[3:59:51] <+Goraka91> With their tentacle hands
[3:59:52] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Web designers
[3:59:53] <Parapattern> Odd
[3:59:54] <dekkitout> Doing what?
[3:59:55] <%Scevda> @keystonea2 true
[3:59:55] <+RoByte2> They also have to spend a lot of time falsifying the fossil record of every world
[4:00:00] <ExemplarKyle> Javik did say their technology was impressive.
[4:00:00] <%Foopoof> how are spiders helping
[4:00:03] <dekkitout> @hraezlyrnoyaiba Boo
[4:00:03] <%James_Quivers> THEY'RE BUILDING IT WITH THEIR ACID TENTACLES SOMEHOW
[4:00:04] <Aiutare47> @GustauveVIII they multiply their forces by harvesting life
[4:00:04] <%BlackStarAura> Huge war asset
[4:00:07] <%miguelrod777> they're super smart surprisingly
[4:00:12] <%peachy996> Rachni workers holding datapads
[4:00:13] <ape_hawk> the female
[4:00:14] <%Ches_Neckbeard> sacrificed aralakh company for some dumb bugs
[4:00:15] <%RonaldMcDownload> Grunt is worth 1/4 of an entire fleet
[4:00:15] <alrobot2014> can just imagine rachni bugs holding wrenches
[4:00:15] <+squeejiro> fookin prawns
[4:00:17] <%Foopoof> oh
[4:00:19] <santafer> grunt has the war assets of 1/3 of a fleet
[4:00:23] <%hax_metatron> YES MAKE IT MORE video game bullshit
[4:00:25] <%MidnightBurst12> the rachni build ships
[4:00:26] <viewtifulr> grunt HUGE war assist
[4:00:33] <%Scevda> @ronaldmcdownload about accurate
[4:00:45] <%RealThiele> War is X
[4:00:46] <+Goraka91> We never really see it but I assume Rachni tech is big into the bio-organic stuff
[4:00:48] <Gruhunchously> @Ches_Neckbeard Dumb bugs that almost conquered the galaxy once
[4:00:50] <cpt_langosta> Talk to Wrex about choppa-choppa da peepee
[4:00:50] <@QueequegTheater> Grunt is like 30 ships' worth of war assist
[4:00:56] <KokiriKid07> cut his dick!

[4:01:35] <+TheJubbernaut> NAAWWTT THE BAWWWLLLSSS
[4:01:36] <%DrTomT18> >BENNING
[4:01:37] <%Scevda> LIKE A GOOD CHRISTIAN LIZARD
[4:01:39] <TourettesPlays> Mordin cut a slice of skin off Wrex's quad like a grocery store deli clerk
[4:01:40] <FassieFons> won't he just regenerate his ball back?
[4:01:42] <DatAsuna> anything N7 is generic
[4:01:44] <%Solid_Stro> He cut Wrex’s Dick-tator
[4:01:45] <+goblinking92> for the krogan race
[4:01:48] <%DrTomT18> That's  where that dudes son was!
[4:01:52] <Jaysky> WHat order are the missions on the guide Pat?
[4:02:03] <Sp3ctre48> Excuse me Ms.Soldier dropping asteroids is against the space geneva conventions
[4:02:03] <%DrTomT18> things to want
[4:02:07] <Maids4lyfe> he's the Lance Armstrong of Krogan now, he's more aerodynamic and thus now has a physical advantage
[4:02:11] <hereiam407> Time travel
[4:02:16] <akitanito> korgans
[4:02:17] <Jaysky> The Reapers 2.
[4:02:18] <%DrTomT18> Pat, wait for it
[4:02:18] <Gruhunchously> Lady, when this war is over there's going to be nothing left
[4:02:19] <%AzureGale> Super Reapers
[4:02:19] <%Foopoof> small scale for sure
[4:02:20] <wasdsf> THE SUPER REAPERS
[4:02:20] <ape_hawk> ALTERNATE UNIVERSE REAPERS
[4:02:21] <DatAsuna> saving the galaxy is not welcome again
[4:02:21] <M0untain_wolf> Batarians
[4:02:22] <+DracosMagala> The Yahg
[4:02:24] <%Treasure_Vault> One actual wizard
[4:02:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Space COVID
[4:02:25] <+Goraka91> Probably why Andromeda was in another galaxy, where do you even go after 3?
[4:02:26] <%Foopoof> nothing can top the reapers
[4:02:27] <Maids4lyfe> racism
[4:02:27] <%peachy996> It has to balance the scale
[4:02:27] <SaltyAzteca> Cerberus?
[4:02:27] <santafer> well, galactic politics would collapse
[4:02:27] <%AmericanSkidd> The Yahg would be a contender
[4:02:29] <%snow_bush> Go street level
[4:02:29] <%toastybites> The Batarian Revengence
[4:02:30] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Mass Effect 4 needs to be just a rebuilding adventure
[4:02:30] <Dunmarkh> wonder what green asari is doing these days
[4:02:31] <%DrTomT18> The Yahg, yeah
[4:02:32] <hereiam407> Time travel to fix the past
[4:02:33] <Deoxplosion> Dark matter?
[4:02:33] <+D00msDayDan> you don't need a galaxy-ending threat, or even a planet-ending threat, personal stories are good too
[4:02:33] <%Scevda> CITADEL STORIES
[4:02:33] <ExemplarKyle> The better question is what ending will be canon. It's gotta be the Destroy ending, right?
[4:02:34] <Profmcstevie> Bits and pieces
[4:02:34] <%robuttastic> FIRST CONTACT WAR?
[4:02:35] <cpt_langosta> You have to literally fight EA
[4:02:35] <%dukeofhammer> Yeah
[4:02:35] <%AzureGale> The Sith Empire
[4:02:35] <Madinki> GET THE YAHG
[4:02:36] <%James_Quivers> The Burning Legion shows up
[4:02:37] <KeystoneA2> Literally nothing, really. The only threat could be other species' warring with each other for galactic dominion
[4:02:37] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Hard FTL travel to reconstruct the Mass Relay Network?
[4:02:37] <hairtoday> just rebuilding would be a hell of a story
[4:02:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt We've only seen Liara, it could be 900 years later
[4:02:38] <%Scevda> JUST LIKE DS9
[4:02:38] <M0untain_wolf> Racism? again?
[4:02:39] <%Retinolgaming> Honestly just the undertaking of trying to rebuild is enough.
[4:02:40] <%miguelrod777> literal magic would exist by that point
[4:02:40] <+MillerLowlife> citadel noir detective game
[4:02:42] <blackjack8182> Eviler Council
[4:02:42] <stantheman_97> it would take thousands of years to recover
[4:02:43] <Ardailec> They tried smaller for Andromeda. I think they'd have to Starcraft 1 it and just have one of the dominant factions go crazy
[4:02:43] <santafer> Prothean Reclamation
[4:02:43] <%DashXero> Wait. There's gonna be a ME4?!
[4:02:44] <digaogrunge> Stop shepard in me4
[4:02:44] <@goose_attack_almanac> Mass Effect 4: oh no the DarkSpawn!
[4:02:44] <M0untain_wolf> or worse
[4:02:44] <olaksi> it would be fascinating so of course they didn't explore it
[4:02:45] <viewtifulr> The space wizard MIRASMES
[4:02:45] <%RealThiele> Rise of the spidermen
[4:02:46] <+ryuguitarfreak> The Kett in Andromeda were a joke
[4:02:46] <Sp3ctre48> idk but Bioware has had a REALLY bad trackrecord with antagonists recently so I'm kinda worried
[4:02:46] <%peachy996> The scale in Andromeda was smaller than reapers but at the same time boring
[4:02:47] <%Shubreaker> small scale galactic reparations make a great setting
[4:02:47] <%walternatorz> Krogan actually rise up again and take over the galaxy
[4:02:48] <TourettesPlays> I would argue that Mass Effect 4 is nearly impossible to write
[4:02:48] <steve_the_suus> first contact war would be legit
[4:02:48] <zerointelligence000> Maybe a race that evolved from dark energy?
[4:02:49] <%AzureGale> Q
[4:02:49] <KokiriKid07> I mean ME3 is my favorite but like anything might be better than andromeda right?
[4:02:49] <%BlackStarAura> Benning is where the Human Ambassador’s son was
[4:02:50] <perfectharbinger> The only thing I can think of is something in one of ME3's DLCs that we can't discuss yet.
[4:02:50] <%rockcentuar> true
[4:02:52] <oda_flobunaga> The Dominion Show up
[4:02:52] <M0untain_wolf> Mega racism
[4:02:53] <%lloyddboy> MASS EFFECT 4: ATTACK OF THE BLUSSY
[4:02:53] <williamrooster> maby they'll bring back the dark energy plot
[4:02:53] <Gruhunchously> It's actually kind of fascinating how Bioware bascially locked themselves out of future endings
[4:02:53] <AngryAsian5> Imagine if they bring back the Dark Energy shit they threw away LUL
[4:02:55] <%Puhff> very curois to see what magic they replace mass effect fields with
[4:02:55] <%rockcentuar> more krogan
[4:02:56] <luftraumm1> it wouldn't the writers couldn't handle the complexity
[4:02:57] <Parapattern> I almost wish the reapers had been neutralized without an invasion. Then it would just be games of inane space adventure
[4:02:58] <%Treasure_Vault> All this space tomfoolery and one guy yelling "abra cadabra" and causing a ruckus
[4:02:58] <28moogles> That's why Dragon Age 2 is the best one. ;)
[4:03:04] <+cermo55> A threat from a new galaxy? New magic element?
[4:03:04] <Aiutare47> I'm guessing it will be about the fractured factions and the utter apocalypse that theyre rebuilding from
[4:03:06] <%AzureGale> You have to fight Kirby
[4:03:06] <%AmericanSkidd> EDI can smell dick
[4:03:10] <%Scevda> @sp3ctre48 same, dont count on it
[4:03:10] <Sp3ctre48> Andromeda tried to make it personal and that villain was super not good
[4:03:10] <DatAsuna> racist
[4:03:12] <TheAntiNihilist> Andromeda was the good way to go, but there should've been WAAAY more story carried over from 3
[4:03:13] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Dealing with the aftermath could make threewhole games
[4:03:15] <KeystoneA2> "I have amusing sex memories of her tentacles and your cock. Oops."
[4:03:15] <cpt_langosta> Asari bondage process?
[4:03:18] <$Spydurman> You could do something like Spiderman Homecoming where it's centered around rebuilding and post Reaper tech
[4:03:19] <%rkbinder> Andromeda Krogan still have genophage
[4:03:21] <HeroToxiko> LUL
[4:03:27] <%RealThiele> henis penis behavior
[4:03:29] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:03:30] <%peachy996> She has not
[4:03:31] <Gruhunchously> Can't she just look it up on Space Google? She is an AI after all
[4:03:33] <+ryuguitarfreak> Andromeda in the end tried to setup something really huge though
[4:03:34] <stantheman_97> not private enough
[4:03:35] <HeroToxiko> @cpt_langosta sex she means sex
[4:03:37] <+Goraka91> F those guys LUL
[4:03:38] <%peachy996> Everyone knows she's the broker
[4:03:39] <SaltyAzteca> SHHHHH DAS A SECREEET
[4:03:39] <kingra> LUL
[4:03:40] <cpt_langosta> They left before the cure
[4:03:40] <@QueequegTheater> "Whoops"
[4:03:41] <DatAsuna> If shepard doesn't know she's the shadow broker, EDI lets it slip there lol
[4:03:41] <+Buzzkill983> They are recovering slowly though
[4:03:41] <alwayspronking> LUL
[4:03:41] <%andrewofbob> ME4 will probably be a bunch of ultra-xenophobic isolationists or supremacists; kinda be relevant to today's nationalism
[4:03:42] <+dd44dostivei> she was an open book for shepard
[4:03:43] <+senfood> Yeah, just talk about her being the Shadow Broker, EDI.
[4:03:43] <%AmericanSkidd> oh, yeah
[4:03:44] <Shockmaster182> I’d like mass effect 4 to move away from you being like a military bro
[4:03:44] <@ssjklyco> Future mass effect should have them take place on single planets instead of full galaxy
[4:03:45] <hereiam407> Why would they send them?
[4:03:46] <santafer> they cured it in the 600 years travel
[4:03:47] <+ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt if you do that line without doing the Shadow Broker DLC, Shepard goes, "EXCUSE ME? Shadow Broker?"
[4:03:47] <%homelesstwinky> that's dark
[4:03:48] <%hatok> if Shepard doesn't know Liara is the shadow Broker that conversation with EDI is how he finds out
[4:03:50] <%hax_metatron> Andromeda did well with its sense of scale IMO. Felt like a good palate cleanser. But not enough at the same time.
[4:03:51] <%Dakuu75> TANK BABY~! lol <3
[4:03:51] <%moonmintparadise> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:03:52] <@Ranryu692> WOW OF COURSE
[4:03:53] <%DrTomT18> heheh
[4:03:54] <%peachy996> Actually the Andromeda Krogan are slowly working on a soft cure
[4:03:57] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[4:03:58] <KokiriKid07> baby boi kicked ass heh heh heh
[4:03:58] <%BlackStarAura> LOVE YOU DRACK
[4:03:59] <%kettleroot> no they dont, they fucking talk about curing it in andromeda
[4:04:02] <$Faustgesicht> What's stupid now?
[4:04:03] <%Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[4:04:03] <$StrawberryPantsu> When did they leave for Andromeda?
[4:04:03] <$Spydurman> LUL
[4:04:07] <%teefpal> I hope the Krogan are the morally-grey badguys
[4:04:08] <$StrawberryPantsu> Before the War?
[4:04:09] <%peachy996> They talk about it on Elaaden
[4:04:10] <Sp3ctre48> I thought they had some kind of cure in Andromeda
[4:04:10] <chainsaw105> if you don't do the Shadow Broker DLC EDI drops the bit of her being the Shadow Broker and Shepard is like "wait what?"
[4:04:12] <%hax_metatron> NOOOI
[4:04:15] <+beansoup> Andromeda wasn't that bad tbh. I got it cheap and it was a solid 6/10
[4:04:16] <HeroToxiko> what if the andromeda folks are the villains' of 4 LUL
[4:04:17] <ExemplarKyle> Makes sense. Krogan are wide-spread conquerors and only the Krogan on Tuchanka get cured.
[4:04:17] <%Shubreaker> jermaMustard
[4:04:18] <+Goraka91> The concept of Andromeda was good, but the writing was just...mm
[4:04:21] <MarylandJutsu> the Elmo note/
[4:04:22] <williamrooster> bringing krogon to Andromeda is the pointless thing ever
[4:04:23] <+TrevSmith222> Well...yeah.  They left before the events of 3.
[4:04:24] <DatAsuna> @kettleroot they talk about potentially curing it iirc
[4:04:25] <%teefpal> Like a Galactic Cold War
[4:04:26] <Shatterthought> @StrawberryPantsu sometime around ME2
[4:04:26] <@QueequegTheater> @Faustgesicht the krogans in Andromeda still have the genophage because they left the galaxy before the cure
[4:04:29] <+D00msDayDan> the reapers deploy their ultimate weapon: the brown note
[4:04:29] <%rkbinder> Andromeda left between me2 and me3
[4:04:31] <%Puhff> the genophage doesn't get "cured" anyway, even is mass effect 3
[4:04:32] <%moonmintparadise> so they went all the way out there, to live escaped from a galaxy that was safed, and all the bottled up issues are just in a different system now? BACK TO SQUARE !
[4:04:34] <%Scevda> @kettleroot thats also stupid. Its stupid either way. Andromeda Is stupid.
[4:04:35] <%sunsetdisc0> shout out to my boy Nakmlr Drack love you grampa
[4:04:36] <%afronooch> the krogan in Andromeda had a semi immunity that they worked on during the trip. So it's "cured"
[4:04:38] <%AmericanSkidd> soon
[4:04:38] <M0untain_wolf> Sour notes of Nanomachines
[4:04:40] <%DashXero> Are the fish in need of food?
[4:04:42] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Pretty sure the Andromeda Initiative left before the Reaper invasion in 3
[4:04:43] <Ks201> Actuall in the andromeda lore because they were frozen there bodies adapted to it and eventually the genophage cured itself
[4:04:44] <Maids4lyfe> the Reaper brown note, the galaxy shits itself and has to surrender out of embarrassment
[4:04:45] <cpt_langosta> use the laptop to call up grunt
[4:04:47] <M0untain_wolf> Not yet
[4:04:48] <+Buzzkill983> I like the Krogan in Andromeda are like fuck it, we can do a lot of shit ourselves
[4:04:52] <KokiriKid07> Shepard and his dumb spaceship toys lol
[4:04:53] <DatAsuna> @williamrooster the purpose is henchmen, so they served it
[4:04:53] <%Treasure_Vault> It's fucked up that Liara and Tali don't make out even once
[4:04:54] <M0untain_wolf> ***
[4:04:56] <Parapattern> No :(
[4:04:56] <Profmcstevie> Edi, locate Tali immeditely. I'm horny
[4:04:56] <+ScrapKingKeita> Doesn't the Andromeda Krogan genophage raise the survival rate of Krogan babies to 4%? Which is massive?
[4:04:58] <perfectharbinger> The people in Andromeda leave just after 2.
[4:04:59] <dekkitout> "Where are the purple women at?"
[4:05:02] <%peachy996> The writing for the Krogan in Andromeda is wonky.
[4:05:04] <Mcjiggyjay> @PatStaresAt they talk about how they picked a bunch of krogen who are becoming immune
[4:05:12] <%peachy996> Some things are good some things are dumb
[4:05:13] <@QueequegTheater> Yes, they were
[4:05:17] <@QueequegTheater> Huge cowards
[4:05:23] <+dd44dostivei> ADAMS WHY AREN'T YOU IN ENGINEERING
[4:05:23] <alrobot2014> didn't the andromeda initiative leave back during the time between 1 and 2
[4:05:24] <DatAsuna> Drack and his granddaughter are solid yeah
[4:05:27] <Profmcstevie> Also fuck Kaiden
[4:05:27] <+condemned_15> Kaidan was BIG coward
[4:05:29] <%BlackStarAura> Fuck Kaidan
[4:05:30] <+Buzzkill983> Greg getting that Dussy?
[4:05:31] <Sp3ctre48> Liara got an entire video game that happened off screen
[4:05:32] <%andrewofbob> Wrex, too
[4:05:33] <%DashXero> Doc is so cool!
[4:05:34] <%Shubreaker> Kaidan was def a huge coward
[4:05:37] <%Ches_Neckbeard> @peachy996 the writing all around was just bad
[4:05:37] <M0untain_wolf> This is why the Doc is Best
[4:05:38] <%AzureGale> Hello, commander
[4:05:40] <KokiriKid07> Kaiden mad, Liara sad not cowards
[4:05:41] <SaltyAzteca> Wrex.
[4:05:45] <+senfood> oh god II'm shipping it.
[4:05:45] <MarylandJutsu> @QueequegTheater liara literally got Shepards dead body
[4:05:47] <%machshop> sometimes
[4:05:49] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It's kind of amazing you never got promoted to Captain or something at least
[4:05:49] <%peachy996> The Krogan fight scene in Andromeda is criiiiiiinnnnnge

[4:05:58] <BlindGato> Where. Is. TALI???
[4:05:58] <+RoByte2> It's not like you have a map that tells you where people are...
[4:06:00] <DatAsuna> @alrobot2014 yeah that's meant to explain why they still have omni gel .etc but use thermal clips
[4:06:00] <+DracosMagala> I do wanna see a Space Werewolf
[4:06:00] <Mattais88> Samara room gets some in there later
[4:06:01] <stantheman_97> crazy talk
[4:06:04] <santafer> Garrus loves bragging
[4:06:04] <+RyanTheRecluse> this is the hangout room
[4:06:05] <Gruhunchously> It's kind of sad how so much of the dialgoue in this game is non-interactive, but I guess that was the price of rushed development
[4:06:07] <alrobot2014> @Scevda ah thanks
[4:06:08] <tanarath> Liara had to sieze control a galactic spy network.
[4:06:08] <%kettleroot> @kettleroot im like 90% sure they said that something in the cryo process massively increased their birth success
[4:06:09] <%SaphronBlackbourne> If only there was a map
[4:06:09] <Sp3ctre48> Garrus stop being so sexy
[4:06:11] <%peachy996> Look at Garrus being all cool
[4:06:12] <dekkitout> Garry's not calibrating for once?
[4:06:12] <@QueequegTheater> @MarylandJutsu After he was dead. Coward.
[4:06:14] <%AzureGale> Hello, raiders!
[4:06:19] <%machshop> Garrus flexing his big dick
[4:06:19] <+PenmanLupine> Garrus got himself a fanboy
[4:06:23] <%machshop> or cloaca i gues
[4:06:24] <perfectharbinger> I think this dialogue changes depending on whether you take Garrus to Noveria or once.
[4:06:28] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:06:28] <zerointelligence000> Garrus is in a fuck me pose
[4:06:28] <DatAsuna> garrus flexing on the ensigns

[4:06:44] <+redthebaron> we will never stop
[4:06:45] <%MidnightBurst12> Garrus's penis
[4:06:49] <Sp3ctre48> I will never stop talking about Garrus' dick

[4:06:55] <%peachy996> Big Blue Popsicle
[4:06:55] <%DrTomT18> did you know you can NOT recruit Garrus in Mass Effect 1?
[4:07:01] <%Scevda> @dakuu75 thats a little video game system.

[4:07:12] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt And he still shows up as Archangel
[4:07:13] <%DrTomT18> it changes your relationship with him a lot
[4:07:14] <%NopeBadguy> You don't have to recruit Garrus or Wrex
[4:07:14] <DatAsuna> Yeah it makes his mission in ME2 weird
[4:07:19] <chainsaw105> you must take Garrus or Wrex in ME1
[4:07:19] <%lloyddboy> GHOST SPIDERS
[4:07:24] <%AmericanSkidd> Real talk, the Rachni Queen, if you could, would you?
[4:07:26] <Parapattern> They talk as though the Krogan's physical strength will help in battling robots the size of battleships
[4:07:28] <+D00msDayDan> you can turn down garrus, wrex, and tali in ME1 and just have the humans and liara
[4:07:31] <Maids4lyfe> angel spiders
[4:07:32] <Gruhunchously> Grunt is worth more than 1/4 of a fleet
[4:07:35] <santafer> you can be racist in ME1 and tell the turian to get lost
[4:07:37] <%demiiluna> @AmericanSkidd yes
[4:07:37] <%DrTomT18> @AmericanSkidd uh. No.
[4:07:39] <hereiam407> @AmericanSkidd What?

[4:07:53] <%lloyddboy> @AmericanSkidd would I what? zerk off onto her eggs?
[4:08:00] <DatAsuna> @Parapattern It's an annoying thing I dislike in this game where they count husks as reapers
[4:08:00] <$KnivesEve> @AmericanSkidd maybe
[4:08:01] <stantheman_97> LUL
[4:08:03] <Sp3ctre48> Funny how being racist in ME1 gets you stuck with all the bad characters
[4:08:08] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[4:08:09] <M0untain_wolf> Not the orignal voice actor
[4:08:10] <%UvBenServed> Yeah...
[4:08:11] <+senfood> oh god I'm shipping it.
[4:08:21] <+Kobi_Robi_Tobi> She don't have a squid mouth for nothin
[4:08:23] <%AmericanSkidd> For the record, I would
[4:08:24] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @strakillias unconsidered but now im on board
[4:08:33] <%peachy996> He still does a good job with Mordin
[4:08:35] <perfectharbinger> For a different VA, this guy does such a good job as Mordin.
[4:08:44] <+SinnerEbru> wow the shot reverse-shot is WAY better than it was in ME2
[4:08:46] <ExemplarKyle> Boy that technology would be helpful when the human race inevitably glasses each other.
[4:08:52] <%X2Eliah> yes
[4:08:52] <hereiam407> Yep
[4:08:53] <Gruhunchously> I'm still surprised that the krogan didn't just blow it up eventually out of spite
[4:08:55] <MarylandJutsu> yeah different VA for mordin
[4:08:56] <Shatterthought> @M0untain_wolf does a damned good job imitating the original. Couldn't tell the difference my first playthrough
[4:08:56] <M0untain_wolf> YEP
[4:08:56] <%X2Eliah> different VA
[4:08:57] <+Goraka91> Yeah they do a good job
[4:09:00] <28moogles> Yeah I didn't notice when playing
[4:09:03] <Jaysky> It's so close
[4:09:04] <Maids4lyfe> he sounds the same
[4:09:06] <Sp3ctre48> Was either that or get genocided by the bugs
[4:09:07] <Aiutare47> god imagine it from a human perspective, aliens just show up, fix climate change, cure cancer, then ask us to kill bugs
[4:09:09] <%Dakuu75> get that Krogussy
[4:09:09] <cpt_langosta> huh!?
[4:09:10] <%dawarw0lf> The voice actor did other salarian in 2
[4:09:11] <stantheman_97> i also didn't notice. huh
[4:09:11] <perfectharbinger> What happened to Mordin's original VA?
[4:09:12] <@goose_attack_almanac> not with that attitude
[4:09:12] <%Shubreaker> imagine if after we demolish the ozone layer, the aliens show up
[4:09:13] <blackjack8182> Rigby
[4:09:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Man Pre Uplift Krogan would ave been the hardest core
[4:09:17] <hereiam407> EDI hasn't added any mods yet
[4:09:19] <Dunmarkh> I thought he sounded off
[4:09:21] <Ks201> Yeah I never noticed ethier
[4:09:21] <%Scevda> @perfectharbinger its mark meer and he did as good as one could expect. Still like the original’s inflections more.
[4:09:24] <Profmcstevie> It's like slightly higher than the old VA, very close
[4:09:30] <Gruhunchously> Eve is played by Lani Manella if I recall - aka, the go-to for gravelly female voice roles
[4:09:39] <%SaphronBlackbourne> When you compare the two Mordin VAs he sounds little different but when playing it feels the same
[4:09:40] <KokiriKid07> How does that chair move with that big ol wire on the floor
[4:09:42] <MarylandJutsu> Gief no like hiding Prothean technoloy
[4:09:43] <chainsaw105> the easiest way to tell is that the new guy doesn't talk as fast
[4:09:52] <shadespiral> @dawarw0lf And also the Turian politician who Thane's son tried to assassinate.
[4:09:55] <hereiam407> galaxy
[4:09:55] <dekkitout> Liara is a fan of Operation: Paperclip
[4:09:58] <Jaysky> Probably possibly
[4:10:02] <%NopeBadguy> She's basically the secondary protagonist in this game
[4:10:02] <Profmcstevie> She's lesser EDI for our cause
[4:10:06] <cpt_langosta> Next to Pretor Gavorn, of course
[4:10:07] <DatAsuna> She's one of only 3 characters that CANNOT die before earth
[4:10:11] <%andrewofbob> I mean, she has Miranda's old room...
[4:10:14] <M0untain_wolf> The Shadow broker is the second important person
[4:10:17] <Shockmaster182> Do you think Margaret Thatcher had girl power?
[4:10:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Hand motions
[4:10:18] <DatAsuna> So yeah, she's important lol
[4:10:20] <Sp3ctre48> Liara is Bioware's waifu so she gets all the extra content
[4:10:23] <%Treasure_Vault> What were those hand motions?
[4:10:25] <TheAntiNihilist> all crimes FORGIVEN! How could this go wrong?
[4:10:25] <%AmericanSkidd> This is a rough Idea to think about
[4:10:30] <%Treasure_Vault> Pull the rope?
[4:10:34] <holyxgrale> Strategic hand movements
[4:10:34] <%peachy996> You just might
[4:10:37] <%X2Eliah> MASS EFFECT 4 TEASER
[4:10:37] <%toastybites> she basically is
[4:10:37] <hereiam407> Practically a baby
[4:10:39] <%Scevda> @nopebadguy its kind of irritating how much she gets focused on.
[4:10:41] <M0untain_wolf> Shes like 19
[4:10:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Nobody Say it
[4:10:45] <M0untain_wolf> human years
[4:10:49] <@QueequegTheater> Literally right in front of you
[4:10:52] <%Retinolgaming> Edi is probably the most important. Half the stuff this crew does isn't possible without Edi.
[4:10:52] <digaogrunge> Shes THE character in the ME4 teaser and the cannon love interest
[4:10:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Nobody Say it....
[4:10:55] <williamrooster> Liara is becoming a defeatist
[4:10:59] <%teefpal> Uh ok liara
[4:10:59] <Madinki> She's like....22 i think
[4:10:59] <@goose_attack_almanac> what IS te average human lifespan now
[4:11:04] <KeystoneA2> Steak, Liara. I fuckin' love STEAK.
[4:11:07] <@QueequegTheater> @goose_attack_almanac 120
[4:11:07] <perfectharbinger> There is no canon love interest.
[4:11:08] <%DrTomT18> LIKE TALI
[4:11:09] <holyxgrale> Isn't shepherd immortal at this point
[4:11:09] <Shatterthought> @Scevda right? If there were a way to kill her early on I'd probably take it, consequences be damned
[4:11:10] <M0untain_wolf> Naw bra 19
[4:11:10] <kingra> STEAKS
[4:11:11] <+bubblebasspickles> i think of steak
[4:11:11] <Dunmarkh> she's like 10
[4:11:13] <+vicar_anat> STEAK
[4:11:14] <Gruhunchously> SO here's a question, why don't the Reapers just go straight for the Citadel and use it to lock down the rest of the Mass Relays?
[4:11:14] <%peachy996> Maybe we can finally kill her off in 4
[4:11:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Steak
[4:11:15] <%demiiluna> I think about when there's SO MUCH STEAK.
[4:11:17] <Jaysky> @digaogrunge Canon my bussy
[4:11:18] <SaltyAzteca> my fish
[4:11:18] <Maids4lyfe> @goose_attack_almanac still less than 100
[4:11:21] <%Deft_Thought> Shepard you're so strong and so wise and so powerful and heroic
[4:11:22] <%peachy996> That'd be fun
[4:11:22] <dekkitout> "And it got better with the bionics"
[4:11:23] <%sunsetdisc0> I thought it was 150
[4:11:26] <Maids4lyfe> oh I was wrong
[4:11:28] <%moonmintparadise> yeah its nuts man
[4:11:28] <%teefpal> Nah she's considered early 20s
[4:11:28] <Maids4lyfe> ignore me!
[4:11:36] <DatAsuna> It's only that long if you're rich
[4:11:37] <Mattais88> Anderson says somewhere that 70 is the new 30
[4:11:37] <Goatllama> Steak keeps me going , Liara. Steak.
[4:11:38] <%andrewofbob> Warp is good
[4:11:38] <+dd44dostivei> turians are only 80 i think
[4:11:38] <hereiam407> Up to 150 years old
[4:11:42] <ExemplarKyle> In Mass Effect canon, human life expectancy is around 150.
[4:11:43] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> i think about steak liara.
[4:11:43] <stantheman_97> shepard said 150 is lucky, so probably like 130
[4:11:44] <M0untain_wolf> we'll bang okay
[4:11:44] <xenoutbreak> SHEPARD I'M A REAPER DOOMSDAY DEVICE!
[4:11:48] <%teefpal> 105 years is a good est
[4:11:48] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's 150
[4:11:53] <%teefpal> *150
[4:11:56] <alrobot2014> it gets brought up once in ME1 as well
[4:11:59] <cpt_langosta> WTF SPIDERS
[4:11:59] <%X2Eliah> Reapers don't control citadel, so if reapers fly to citadel, citadel closes up and cannot be entered
[4:12:00] <%ospreyworks> am I crazy, or does Pat!Shep kinda look like the dad from heavy rain?
[4:12:00] <TourettesPlays> @ExemplarKyle that sounds fucking miserable i dont even want to live past 30
[4:12:00] <Goatllama> OH SHI
[4:12:04] <psilent_p> im lovin all the gamer poop quotes chat knows by heart. LUL
[4:12:05] <@ssjklyco> Does it also slow the aging process as well? or are you still useless once you reach 80?
[4:12:05] <Sp3ctre48> Gets an offscreen adventure where she gives Shepard's corpse to Cerberus, gets her own DLC, gets all the high quality romance scenes. Being a Tali bro is suffering
[4:12:06] <Madinki> @xenoutbreak OH SHI-
[4:12:06] <@QueequegTheater> Sure Pat Kappa
[4:12:06] <%X2Eliah> thats why reapers are ignoring it
[4:12:10] <holyxgrale> Did cerberus rebuilding shepherd give him the ability to live longer or something?
[4:12:17] <@goose_attack_almanac> still like 80 more years than I'll reach lol
[4:12:22] <hereiam407> How dare you
[4:12:23] <%CalderGaming> i want to read a vignette about a rachni worker at the crucible, man
[4:12:23] <M0untain_wolf> 150 galactic cycles
[4:12:24] <+GuilKato> shepard is full of tech to make him live longer
[4:12:26] <%Scevda> @shatterthought nah, she reminds me too much of myself but she shouldn’t be protagonist 1-b considering everyone having made their other love choices in the prior game.
[4:12:29] <+GuilKato> just needs some brain implants
[4:12:29] <%strakillias> 175 seems like a decent max with a normal expectancy of 150
[4:12:32] <zerointelligence000> Hi Battle Tits
[4:12:34] <%teefpal> @goose_attack_almanac same
[4:12:37] <%Shubreaker> cry more allers
[4:12:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Learn to do number baby man
[4:12:38] <%X2Eliah> Oh yes the rachni, SPLOOSH
[4:12:41] <M0untain_wolf> Which is like fuck how many actual earth years?
[4:12:42] <KnightOfTrousers> Do they not carry the same codex logs from ME1 and 2??? I thought ME3 was the PerFeCt PlACe to StaRt?!
[4:12:44] <perfectharbinger> You deserve so much better, Traynor lol.
[4:12:47] <%andrewofbob> Does the crew talk through her camera?
[4:12:50] <ExemplarKyle> @TourettesPlays We already look like a pile of flat tires when we reach 70-80. I can only imagine how ancient/brittle we are at 150. It must suck ass.
[4:12:50] <Goatllama> O__O
[4:12:51] <ape_hawk> such a great voice actress
[4:12:52] <%Meekest> Can you do us a favor and never talk to her again
[4:12:55] <%peachy996> Real useful she is
[4:12:58] <Ner234> Naturally
[4:12:59] <@goose_attack_almanac> Grunt is equal to five Diana Allers
[4:13:01] <holyxgrale> LUL
[4:13:02] <%machshop> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:13:03] <@ssjklyco> She's dealing wiith her own grunt
[4:13:04] <M0untain_wolf> Big struggles
[4:13:06] <MarylandJutsu> doesn't she always lose these fights/
[4:13:10] <hereiam407> @ExemplarKyle Future tech helps prevent the sagging
[4:13:11] <+geekjacob> could we be put into robot bodies by then
[4:13:12] <%miguelrod777> @andrewofbob  intercom system
[4:13:13] <%peachy996> Nah he has to keep jawjackin at diana
[4:13:14] <%akscully> he is looking at you
[4:13:16] <notsoy> paige/gief is an 8:2 matchup
[4:13:17] <KeystoneA2> I mean he is looking at you with 2 eyes.
[4:13:18] <Profmcstevie> Bulldog is the perfect pet for Paige "brittle bones" Salive
[4:13:18] <%lloyddboy> don't talk to him he angy
[4:13:19] <+SinnerEbru> he's trnya flag,pat
[4:13:19] <%homelesstwinky> he needs his goo
[4:13:21] <%Scevda> @sp3ctre48 but much love as well.
[4:13:21] <Jaysky> He's like a cat. He shows you his ass when he trusts you @PatStaresAt
[4:13:23] <notsoy> in gief's favor, ofc
[4:13:25] <$Spydurman> why is she there???
[4:13:26] <M0untain_wolf> Dat his dominate stance
[4:13:33] <%DrTomT18> man the Rachni can't catch a break
[4:13:35] <%X2Eliah> ...
[4:13:35] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[4:13:39] <AngryAsian5> So it's all THEIR fault LUL
[4:13:39] <@QueequegTheater> Wow, fuck your scientists
[4:13:39] <%robotoken> Do Protheans have wings or is that just a collectors thing?
[4:13:41] <%DrTomT18> It's HIGHLY suggested that Soverign started the Rachni Wars
[4:13:41] <+Goraka91> They fucking uplifted the Rachni
[4:13:41] <Sp3ctre48> Javik is so funny
[4:13:47] <%AmericanSkidd> They made Rachni Pit Bulls
[4:13:47] <%miguelrod777> protheans are morons
[4:13:48] <%X2Eliah> So the Proteans made the rachni evil
[4:13:49] <cpt_langosta> stick it in that prothean prolapse
[4:13:50] <%akscully> protheans are the worst
[4:13:50] <%Jeemukun> WHOOPISE
[4:13:52] <zerointelligence000> They fucked the bugs for our cycle
[4:13:52] <dekkitout> Literally made them into xenomorphs
[4:13:52] <ExemplarKyle> Interesting that humans have cured disease to the point that life expectancy is 150, but Joker still gets fucked by brittle bone disease.
[4:13:54] <chainsaw105> imagine going completely celibate for the entire trilogy, only to romance Diana Allers in the end
[4:13:55] <+redthebaron> really should just stop doing this messing with species thing
[4:13:57] <xenoutbreak> The weird part is where the fuck did Javik get this weird Prothean goo?
[4:13:57] <@ssjklyco> Are Protheans just old school Saiyans?
[4:13:57] <KnightOfTrousers> IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT YOU FUCKING NERD
[4:13:57] <SaltyAzteca> thanks Javik
[4:14:00] <%peachy996> Those whacky Protheans
[4:14:02] <Madinki> I COULD BE QUEEN AMONG MY MEN
[4:14:02] <M0untain_wolf> oh no our weapons turned against us whyyy?
[4:14:02] <%Meekest> There was no such thing as a coincidence
[4:14:03] <+dd44dostivei> i think i almost like the reapers more than the protheans
[4:14:03] <Profmcstevie> Not so primitive now huh dumbass
[4:14:07] <KokiriKid07> Nice
[4:14:11] <%Scevda> @ssjklyco about so
[4:14:12] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Ripple effect on display
[4:14:17] <hereiam407> Cute
[4:14:26] <xenoutbreak> NO I WOULD NEED A KING...
[4:14:28] <FassieFons> never stop uplifting them species to fight for you, never goes wrong
[4:14:30] <$Spydurman> are Protheans what would happen if Salarians had longer life spans?
[4:14:33] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah Grunt will show those giant space ships
[4:14:36] <%Shirousuke1989> Javik all you're teaching us is that the Protheans fucking sucked.
[4:14:38] <%peachy996> you are pretty primitive
[4:14:39] <%strakillias> So technically the Genophage is the Protheans fault for making the rachni too OP
[4:14:40] <cpt_langosta> me no dumdum, you dumdum
[4:14:45] <@goose_attack_almanac> crunt
[4:14:46] <%Deft_Thought> Crunt?

[4:15:03] <%Shubreaker> Grunk
[4:15:03] <ExemplarKyle> They advanced to the point of having a collective consciousness and the technology to store that entire consciousness. Fuck yeah we're primitive by comparison.

[4:15:45] <%DrTomT18> can you survive without 200% Pat?
[4:15:47] <viewtifulr> Grunt will bust through a reaper with a BIG STRONK punch
[4:15:48] <ExemplarKyle> Who needs reload speed when you have BIG FUCKING GUN
[4:15:50] <KeystoneA2> Baby arms
[4:15:50] <@commanderclaw> It's the best tho!
[4:15:51] <Aiutare47> but the damage
[4:15:52] <%VioletHeart> It's barely any weight at all.
[4:15:54] <dekkitout> psaBig
[4:15:56] <%castlerock42> Pat, you remember that the lore for that shotgun was that it was heavy?
[4:15:57] <%zuzuxiv> sadge

[4:16:02] <Jaysky> WELLLLLLLL he ain't my boy but the brother is HEAVY
[4:16:04] <+vaderxyz1970> Should rename it to the compensator
[4:16:06] <%Scevda> Acceptable

[4:16:17] <%X2Eliah> I dont think so
[4:16:20] <%AmericanSkidd> At the firing range
[4:16:20] <KeystoneA2> Firing range on the Citadel.
[4:16:22] <xenoutbreak> A krogan voiced by Patrick Warburton would be rad
[4:16:22] <QuestlordJake> you get bar
[4:16:22] <@ssjklyco> Description maybe?
[4:16:22] <Aiutare47> Wraith holds 2 shots
[4:16:25] <%homelesstwinky> ev has 3, wraith 2
[4:16:25] <%peachy996> gun range
[4:16:25] <%rkbinder> 3 to 2
[4:16:26] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun
[4:16:26] <%Scevda> @queequegtheater he doesnt care, he never cares.
[4:16:27] <cpt_langosta> no
[4:16:27] <%lloyddboy> check the wiki!
[4:16:27] <%strakillias> Go to the citadel and whip it out
[4:16:28] <%andrewofbob> Read the wiki or go to the firing range
[4:16:29] <%Shubreaker> not unless you take it to range
[4:16:29] <oda_flobunaga> CAPACITY
[4:16:32] <M0untain_wolf> 2 vs 3
[4:16:34] <%Scevda> Gun tange
[4:16:34] <williamrooster> youll have to look it up
[4:16:35] <perfectharbinger> The Eviscerator has a little more but the Wraith does more damage overall.
[4:16:36] <Aiutare47> its in its description that Wraith holds two
[4:16:36] <ExemplarKyle> Maybe 1-2 extra shots by comparison?
[4:16:36] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Eviscerator has 3.
[4:16:37] <KokiriKid07> shooting range and wraith is 2 ev is 3 yeah
[4:16:45] <Profmcstevie> The genophage, the genophage for the Krogans, the genophage chosen especially to stop the Krogans, Krogan genophage. barbChad
[4:16:49] <%VioletHeart> For reference, a 0% power recharge is about the same as ME2. By sticking at 200% you're going for an extremely castery Vanguard.
[4:16:50] <macavells> N7 crusader best waifu
[4:16:56] <+RyanTheRecluse> wraith is double barrel, I think eviscerator is single shot
[4:17:02] <%Scevda> @profmcstevie that genophage?
[4:17:04] <M0untain_wolf> I like the crusader myself as it a slug thrower
[4:17:05] <Gruhunchously> STEEEEEEVE
[4:17:08] <%rkbinder> Try Crusader
[4:17:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Eh Steve!
[4:17:16] <%capnbeefs> N7 crusader is best shotgun
[4:17:16] <%AzureGale> Good to see you, Commander
[4:17:21] <perfectharbinger> The Crusader is great.
[4:17:24] <@goose_attack_almanac> The wiki lists the clip sizes and reserve ammo. Which ones did you want to look at?

[4:20:11] <williamrooster> thats a big if
[4:20:17] <Profmcstevie> We'll lay a rug over the ending
[4:20:19] <Jaysky> That's if it's good.
[4:20:25] <Tracazoid> Shut up, rubber bullets!
[4:20:26] <cpt_langosta> stories about the shepard
[4:20:26] <Shatterthought> what if they Invisible War it
[4:20:29] <DatAsuna> nah people will still never stop complaining, they'll just complain more briefly now
[4:20:30] <Dunmarkh> No, make them all canon and branching
[4:20:31] <%Scevda> Just like DMC2
[4:20:31] <oda_flobunaga> Mass Effect is Just BSG
[4:20:31] <%DrTomT18> they will likely be a completely different ending than any of the options we get
[4:20:33] <RushUnplugged> "after all that mess with the Reapers, it was hard to rebuild"
[4:20:33] <%lloyddboy> THE PHOTOSHOP KID IN 3
[4:20:34] <Dunmarkh> do it cowards
[4:20:34] <%Agami23> so like dues ex into invisible war?
[4:20:38] <xenoutbreak> Do the Daggerfall, and say ALL the endings are canon.
[4:20:39] <boggycrook> Shepard dies of old age. Liara is alive still
[4:20:43] <ErikFeral> "Here's what really happened... everyone DIED. The End!"
[4:20:43] <%lloyddboy> SEND ORB
[4:20:44] <%teefpal> It'd be an actual miracle if ME4 was good
[4:20:44] <%YakumoYomi> Please?
[4:20:45] <dekkitout> Could make up a whole new ending, who knows
[4:20:50] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[4:20:56] <%X2Eliah> Pasta Rat nudes plz
[4:20:58] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Reaper War Happen and thats it
[4:21:03] <ExemplarKyle> Imagine if it was the refusal ending and ME4 was an XCOM-style resistance game.
[4:21:03] <%afronooch> they have a way to do it and keep shepard, though its a bit of an ass pull
[4:21:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Send helpful nudes
[4:21:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> SalLADYan
[4:21:14] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:21:21] <Jaysky> I want them to bring the child back in Mass Effect 4 so they can sit on the main menu screen
[4:21:32] <SaltyAzteca> all four of their reaper balls
[4:21:35] <%Scevda> @officioprefectuscorgi “They were on vacation”
[4:21:38] <@ssjklyco> He was gimped
[4:21:42] <xenoutbreak> Theyll retcon it so that the reapers aren't canon anymore
[4:21:50] <%shurtal> Heres what happened in ME3 ending:  Revan came back and she punched everyone in the dick
[4:22:15] <%X2Eliah> A batarian couldn't have been worse than Jacob
[4:22:16] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt The idea was turned into that Batarian hacker that Garrus talks about
[4:22:17] <%HaroldDonchee> filth
[4:22:17] <%DrTomT18> kinda, yeah
[4:22:17] <%teefpal> Religious Space North Korea
[4:22:21] <%Scevda> @shurtal and filled thooooose pockets
[4:22:22] <Tracazoid> Alien and learning history>learning about Jacob at his best
[4:22:23] <Maids4lyfe> At least Battarians won't cheat on you
[4:22:25] <stantheman_97> the batarian would have probably had a personality
[4:22:26] <BlooBirdo> not much nuance
[4:22:27] <Aiutare47> thats because of the censorship
[4:22:28] <%DrTomT18> Jacob isn't THAT bad
[4:22:31] <Mattais88> Literal slavers
[4:22:35] <%teefpal> And there no exploration of their lore *whatsoever*
[4:22:36] <+dd44dostivei> they're the dominion
[4:22:37] <%moonmintparadise> batarians are rutheless
[4:22:40] <+SinnerEbru> u always need one unproblematically bad enemy
[4:22:40] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:22:41] <%GarbageNirvana> I feel like by ME3 they realized it was weird to have a whole race of Hitlers which is why they all died
[4:22:41] <%Scevda> Just like cardasians
[4:22:43] <%AzureGale> HOL UP
[4:22:44] <%strakillias> No Batarians are Space Al-Queda
[4:22:59] <boggycrook> Batarians are a race of Renegades
[4:23:00] <%Scevda> Lewd
[4:23:01] <xenoutbreak> Or do a Old Republic and have a  random evil space empire appear, and Shepard jobs to the new OC villain.
[4:23:08] <ExemplarKyle> Honestly, kinda wish Zaeed was a Batarian instead of human. As the leader of the blue suns, it would have made sense.
[4:23:08] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I  Hate Lacus Litore
[4:23:16] <%Agami23> aka the egglord
