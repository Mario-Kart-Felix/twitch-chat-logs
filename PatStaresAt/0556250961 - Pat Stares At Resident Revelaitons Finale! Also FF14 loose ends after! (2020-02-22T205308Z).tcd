[0:09:22] <SoySocks> the calendar isn't real either
[0:09:23] <jettybandit> days have flavors and texture?
[0:09:23] <+griffball13> how can days be real if time isn't real
[0:09:24] <BoneofMalkav> And that texture: FIREBLU LUL
[0:09:25] <%GorboMcDuggins> Thyme is an illusion man
[0:09:26] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> I know what you mean

[0:09:26] <%Nordguy> Saturday has a good Mouth feel
[0:09:28] <%sniffy77> Saturday is when I get a break from 10 hour days so its always great
[0:09:31] <%Mister_McDerp> saturday is chill
[0:09:31] <Pwgregory> Are you on the weed?
[0:09:31] <+Lunarhawk> Time is an imaginary concept
[0:09:33] <+tuchpi> forsen1 forsen2
[0:09:34] <%cureneckbeard> pat right
[0:09:34] <mattrutland> I think its a nstalgia texture thats left over from childhood Pat
[0:09:35] <%armandolorian> suuuuuup
[0:09:38] <astroasis> sunday is the most stressful for that reason
[0:09:39] <+DesertPenguin> LUL ?
[0:09:39] <%Typhaeon> Sunday is "fucking work is X hours/minutes/seconds away" panic
[0:09:39] <+SenorCounter> It's the first day off from school. It's basically ingrained during growing up.
[0:09:39] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Saturday is like, I'm free but tomorrow's free too
[0:09:39] <%D3rrtyD4n> evo19MindBlown

[0:09:51] <wruce_> it's the remnants of your childhood indoctrination towards a five-day workweek
[0:09:55] <%tank7013> I don't like that. Describing days as having a texture. That's some Eldritch Horror shit.
[0:09:55] <%krawtch> common opinion of the chat seems to be one of no sympy to your "work" on Saturday

[0:15:13] <+DesertPenguin> The only way Pat will say pog is in reference to the actual physical pogs we had in the 90s
[0:15:18] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Tarkov is not PUBG, chat. It doesn't have battle royale elements

[0:16:08] <terribleusername> it gives you wings
[0:16:08] <Malziel> We all know it's the giant weed cloud just offscreen, don't lie to us LUL
[0:16:09] <Jolly_Adventurer> You sounded like my chain-smoking neighbor
[0:16:09] <%Jekado> what a coward
[0:16:10] <%ZComiX> Poggers
[0:16:10] <+landmammal> happened to me in the sauna at the gyma nd i inhaled boiling air by accident on the inhale...
[0:16:11] <%shurtal> Pat, dying on stream violates TOS, don't do it, it's not worth the clout
[0:16:12] <WamenaScrub> Was watching the Thing last night. I realized you, and Bennings have a striking resemblance lol
[0:16:17] <%rytyoung> sounds like you've got the weed cough there pat
[0:16:18] <Psyramics> You swallow and the water makes a bubble over your windpipe and you almost die
[0:16:18] <+DesertPenguin> "wrong pipe" is the worst
[0:16:20] <%Maids4lyfe> I sometimes I forget to breathe
[0:16:21] <mattrutland> It was unexpected liquid!
[0:16:22] <%cowardman93> I legitimately started choking at work the other day on absolutely nothing, which was embarrassing
[0:16:23] <%wruce_> you should get book lungs like arthropods
[0:16:23] <terribleusername> don't forget to breathe

[0:16:41] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck you Pat
[0:16:41] <+DesertPenguin> C-Pap machine?
[0:16:43] <%rytyoung> I breath semi automatically
[0:16:43] <%Aracon_> damn bro
[0:16:46] <%roundii> I get that when I draw...just...forget to breath
[0:16:48] <+tuchpi> Pat doesn't even like inhaling smoke, he's not smoking weed LUL
[0:16:48] <%Docblargle> jokes on you! I can't breath at all........help me
[0:16:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> LOL
[0:16:51] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Oh yeah?! Then you're blinking manually now, Pat!
[0:16:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> Awake Apnea
[0:16:52] <%cureneckbeard> Pat has such a good memory that someone told him he was breathing manually in 2006 and he never forgot
[0:16:54] <%valriot> @patstaresat You need that Day 1 patch
[0:16:54] <Captain_Joe1911> cakee5Tuntun
[0:16:55] <%cowardman93> it's that fucking comic of you!
[0:16:55] <%SoFarFetched> AND THEN SC ARE PAIGE
[0:16:55] <%Ner234> Oh PAt
[0:16:56] <%Maids4lyfe> I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
[0:16:56] <%Jumpie8> remember to breathe Pat
[0:16:56] <%ittla> pat isnt creative because he's spending brain cells on keeping his lungs movine
[0:17:00] <%ittla> moving*
[0:17:04] <trianglehat> always never forget
[0:17:06] <%king_wragles> I'm amazed you and Paige made it this far.
[0:17:06] <+DesertPenguin> Oh yea breathing
[0:17:07] <graemecrackers1> just play the game
[0:17:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt you now have to pee
[0:17:09] <terribleusername> just breathe 4Head
[0:17:10] <%Valdorick> Forget breathing! Learn video game Mechanics!
[0:17:10] <DocMadfox> @DesertPenguin C-Pap helps with the physical apnea, not psychological apnea
[0:17:11] <+Lunarhawk> But less important than you might think
[0:17:11] <gade177> Pat have you seen El Camino.
[0:17:12] <%CallMeNamelesS> CallMeNamelesS subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! hey Pat thank you , Peach and Elmo for all the fun times
[0:17:12] <Pwgregory> Forgetting to breathe sucks. Or doesn‚Äôt suck because that‚Äôs dragging in air.
[0:17:12] <ranarath> What was done before breathing was invented?
[0:17:16] <%Aracon_> that only happens to me in stressful situations
[0:17:16] <%Jekado> at least you don't breath for a living....wait
[0:17:19] <%sniffy77> You can't breathe. Peach eats poisonapple.
[0:17:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, when Pat says something crazy is it because there's no oxygen going to his brain?
[0:17:23] <SoySocks> involuntary auto-erotic asphyxiation
[0:17:23] <TwinBat> pass out to make easy mode selectable
[0:17:25] <graemecrackers1> PAT ARE YOU OKAY
[0:17:34] <DocMadfox> I do that too!
[0:17:35] <TomFrank> those are just old man noises
[0:17:36] <%cowardman93> no he is not okay
[0:17:37] <ALTRNico> clip that
[0:17:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> it happens ü§∑
[0:17:38] <terribleusername> natural choke jerking
[0:17:41] <%GinAndRoses> i'd forget my ass if it wasnt attached to my back
[0:17:43] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Breathing is only important to organics, You're just super ready for our robot future
[0:17:43] <%roundii> To breath is a sign of weakness and anyone who breathes while gaming has lost twice
[0:17:44] <%Aracon_> for some reason my brain thinks holding my breath will help me focus
[0:17:44] <gade177> Remembering to breathe is hard.
[0:17:48] <%Maids4lyfe> the brain goblins are merely lack of oxygen
[0:17:49] <+DesertPenguin> I think being overweight may affect it to an extent
[0:17:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> pat isn't creative because the degenerates in chat turn everything into a thing.
[0:17:51] <theKingRamses> you should get a thing to replace your lungs and make you sound like vader
[0:17:54] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt how can you breathe when air isn't real?
[0:17:55] <%cowardman93> hold breath for fish
[0:17:56] <%newmanq22> does pat do shout outs, we are doing a charity stream RN and we are looking for donations to children's hospital of Cincinnati
[0:18:27] <%Agami23> my guess has always been ex-umbrella
[0:18:30] <%Aracon_> there's no way ethan is just some rando
[0:18:33] <%ittla> it sure would be cool if ethan was cool
[0:18:36] <%ittla> like leon
[0:18:39] <%ittla> or anyone else
[0:18:39] <%Ziegsy> I wonder if it is possible to ff14 with pat at all
[0:18:41] <Pwgregory> Or he‚Äôs just a dude.
[0:18:42] <%wruce_> Ethan is HUNK confirmed
[0:18:44] <%Maids4lyfe> Ethan is a secret Wesker I bet
[0:18:44] <%InugamiTheHound> where's my WIFE!!!
[0:18:45] <%DracaenaLeaf> throught he was just a hubby
[0:18:47] <%SoFarFetched> yeah cause random guys panic and DIE
[0:18:48] <+NitronStreams> I wanna see what a post re7 Ethan looks like
[0:18:49] <%rytyoung> yeah bro imma go find my missing girl in the Bayou
[0:18:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I mean he got super infected and could reattach limbs
[0:18:51] <mattrutland> I still dunno how i feel about Werewolves for 8
[0:18:52] <%Ganerumo> Ethan also just knows Chris' group
[0:18:55] <%cowardman93> who in all of RE history has been "Some guy"
[0:19:00] <%Meekest> What if he survived THE TERRAGREGIA PANIC
[0:19:01] <%TheSniperJoe> SEAN
[0:19:02] <chidere> Early stream today?
[0:19:11] <boomstickery> apart from knowing a lot about guns ethan never seemed insane competent
[0:19:14] <+Lost_Zombie> ethan is just leon with the new face
[0:19:14] <DocMadfox> @Ganerumo That made me think he either works with Redfield or New Umbrella
[0:19:23] <chidere> !uptime
[0:19:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 19m 25s.
[0:19:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @cowardman93 I think LEON was the closest in RE2.
[0:19:39] <%CalderGaming> @cowardman93 the Outbreak characters?
[0:19:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> He was just some cop.

[0:20:59] <%Typhaeon> what big revelaitons are left
[0:20:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Caffeine, but not oxygen, NEVER oxygen.

[0:21:04] <%cureneckbeard> psaBig
[0:21:06] <Deadman_Reborn> no Paige?
[0:21:06] <+saltytyrz> Breathing can be challenging
[0:21:14] <%cureneckbeard> Old Pat was thinner.

[0:21:17] <%cvp5127> you had more hair

[0:21:28] <trianglehat> sex noise
[0:21:28] <%cureneckbeard> Pat grunt is one of my top five Pat noises.
[0:21:28] <SoySocks> a weak half-assed grunt of effort
[0:21:30] <%Maids4lyfe> keep smacking
[0:21:30] <StripesUltimateEdition> pantomiming your throws helps
[0:21:31] <DocMadfox> Wait, that's automatic and not a bit?
[0:21:32] <MayorRev> I just go YEET
[0:21:33] <+NitronStreams> *effort noises*

[0:21:44] <%GinAndRoses> "becoming"
[0:21:47] <%Docblargle> We need to make a tier list of Pat noises
[0:21:47] <Dr_Mooose> get that immersion
[0:21:48] <SkyPirateArcane> Whenever I jump in a game, I tense my legs. We all have weird quirks when playing
[0:21:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> "becoming"
[0:21:50] <mattrutland> because Screen PAT shrinks!
[0:21:53] <Su_Nes> that's because you baby
[0:21:53] <%Ziegsy> now hes to scale!
[0:21:57] <theKingRamses> pat wants to become tinier confirmed

[0:22:02] <%Aracon_> it's time to revelate

[0:22:25] <boomstickery> he sometimes makes an attack noise
[0:22:26] <%D3rrtyD4n> that voice
[0:22:26] <%sporeian94> Did you hear about the new FF7 NPC named Chadley?
[0:22:28] <+NitronStreams> Previously on Friends
[0:22:31] <@commanderclaw> Is Crazy Talk just a modern Leprechaun power?
[0:22:31] <SoySocks> woah they do a tv show thing?
[0:22:35] <%wruce_> is that Zack Braff
[0:22:39] <%Aracon_> oh that's right jessica shot this guy
[0:22:40] <seaechiowai> @maids4lyfe that's not a weird dream thats just every man's wish
[0:22:44] <%Aracon_> and NO ONE talked about it
[0:22:44] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:22:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> That guy sounds like discount Buscemi

[0:22:55] <%Typhaeon> Evil Conan was evil the whole time
[0:22:57] <Louie_Salmon> Man resident evil is fuckin' dumb
[0:23:04] <s1rcuit> that dude looks like shit
[0:23:12] <$Hommando> That dude looks like Chucky from Child's Play
[0:23:12] <%Ganerumo> this is especially stupid when you actually did miss out on the previous episodes
[0:23:13] <%GorboMcDuggins> Nope, Grinder got a promotion and now leads the BSAA in South Africa or some shit
[0:23:16] <SoySocks> it's so fucking stupid and it's great for it
[0:23:16] <%Aracon_> it actually might be
[0:23:18] <%optimasmaximas> It‚Äôs Thursday pat!
[0:23:19] <%chhdez> Paige is your treasure, feel free to tell her that and gain relationship points
[0:23:22] <Pwgregory> She wants the D. Unfortunately for her Chris doesn‚Äôt know what sex is.
[0:23:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Resident Evil 1 and 2 were okay
[0:23:23] <%Ilpala> No Exit
[0:23:24] <%wruce_> MGS may beaty it out for dumbest
[0:23:26] <+NitronStreams> RE just turned into an actual cartoon after re4
[0:23:26] <%sniffy77> no way in no way out
[0:23:27] <%ittla> bad resident evil is embarrassing
[0:23:33] <%Typhaeon> It's gone from bad dumb to good dumb with RE2 remake though
[0:23:43] <%Aracon_> eeeewwww
[0:23:45] <%Jekado> thats a lot of virus
[0:23:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Holy shit that's a lot of virus.
[0:23:46] <boomstickery> a fuckign moat fo virus
[0:23:48] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> That's a lot of juice
[0:23:48] <SoySocks> time to go swimming
[0:23:49] <+professormorrigan> look at all that virus juice
[0:23:50] <%NovaKnightmare> so this is what's China's been up to
[0:23:50] <%theotherkristian> I'm expecting Vince Mcmahon emerging as the next villain for Re8
[0:23:52] <s1rcuit> he did say he was prepared
[0:23:53] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> LOOK AT ALL THAT JUICE
[0:23:55] <%Typhaeon> 7 was kind of a turning point but still leaned way too heavily on edgy profanity
[0:23:55] <%Omegaanimus> Wow what a virus
[0:23:55] <boomstickery> who needs a blood moat?
[0:23:56] <%Ganerumo> Chris looks so muck like Iroquois Plisken
[0:23:58] <+prime_name> IT'S BLUD
[0:23:59] <%ittla> the entire ocean would still dilute it
[0:23:59] <%SoFarFetched> Pats like "Im glad I was proven wrong"
[0:24:05] <StripesUltimateEdition> chris!
[0:24:05] <%sonofdamnation37> forbidden kool-aid

[0:25:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> DS puzzles
[0:25:03] <californaya> You have completed my Laser Puzzle. Congratulations.
[0:25:09] <trianglehat> "smell my finger"
[0:25:09] <CrypticMochi> Would small infected fish turn whales into giant carriers?
[0:25:10] <%Aracon_> that worked?
[0:25:12] <Marpolo13> @PatStaresAt when are you going to design your home with various moving puzzles for your guests to solve?
[0:25:15] <Deadmanslegacy> pat what do you think it would take to get woolies to suffer through an entire lp of Deadly Premonition.
[0:25:16] <%Jekado> why is it so easy to enter a new finger print scanner?
[0:25:19] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Yeah, that worked?
[0:25:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love how her utility belt separates her ass and thighs from the unimportant parts of her character model.
[0:25:22] <%Ziegsy> I wanna see zombie whales
[0:25:24] <AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Newtype?
[0:25:31] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Does it mean her finger is on the boat database?
[0:25:31] <+LordSDB> You can set it up for any finger pat
[0:25:32] <%Jekado> before the finger print doors too?
[0:25:44] <%optimasmaximas> @commandersqueaks yup LUL

[0:25:52] <%Ner234> But y tho?
[0:25:54] <%Jekado> @ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº no she goes to a computer that registers her finger print
[0:25:58] <%sporeian94> How is Jill not got a fuckton of Chaffing from that battlesuit?
[0:26:02] <red_blaster> Virus is too OP

[0:26:25] <%Maids4lyfe> okay so Abyss virus wasn't a big deal, but T-Abyss is bad
[0:26:26] <+Kingtut9009> "Can't predict" the hell you mean you'd destroy aquatic life
[0:26:27] <trianglehat> what is their goal tho with the bioterror?
[0:26:32] <%Ran196> did they ever explain why all of this was on a passenger cruise ship?
[0:26:33] <Marpolo13> because they want to feel as relevant
[0:26:36] <%R3Roundabout> big stupid
[0:26:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> to sell it
[0:26:38] <+prime_name> To be remembered?
[0:26:39] <SoySocks> because they're not important, so people get free reign
[0:26:40] <Vikken141> importance since it has no number
[0:26:41] <%Mister_McDerp> to try to be relvant
[0:26:42] <%sniffy77> they want to make a impact
[0:26:42] <%Ilpala> How else would you know they're important?
[0:26:42] <boomstickery> the stakes should be lower so that they feel higher
[0:26:45] <%dave323dave> bc they can get away with it?
[0:26:48] <%sonofdamnation37> because they have more room to experiment
[0:26:55] <%Aracon_> end of the world into SUPER end of the world
[0:26:58] <Pwgregory> I mean RE 3 ended in an American town getting hit by a nuclear bomb.
[0:26:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt some don't but many writers need to up the stakes
[0:26:58] <+professormorrigan> HIGH STAKES
[0:27:01] <%Jekado> world ended 3 times already
[0:27:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> They did, with RE6

[0:27:11] <DocMadfox> RE7's just Shrek's fucking Swamp
[0:27:11] <bear_breaker20> because extra extra effort was put in to find side content vs main content
[0:27:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> That's why I liked the silent hill 2 side story
[0:27:13] <%Kage_96> or a island'\

[0:27:35] <theKingRamses> to be fair this game mostly takes place on a ship
[0:27:36] <%Maids4lyfe> that's the tongue worm I think
[0:27:40] <%sporeian94> Got The T-Virus from eating chipotle lettuce
[0:27:52] <%D3rrtyD4n> resident evil shines when they focus on events at a smaller scale
[0:27:55] <%ittla> resident evil, while it was bad, seemed to have been far more influenced by those terrible movies than anyone would like to admit
[0:27:57] <%Mister_McDerp> oh the weird tongue crab thing fish get sometimes
[0:28:06] <%InugamiTheHound> anal parasites?
[0:28:09] <%Jekado> cold as ice
[0:28:13] <NocturnalScotsman> RE in city's WOULD be world wide if it didnt spill and cause the outbreak
[0:28:20] <%Docblargle> good shot chris
[0:28:22] <%Docblargle> real big help
[0:28:24] <%sniffy77> if you're infecting whales with virus, please understand that you're doing something evil
[0:28:25] <%Ner234> Goopy
[0:28:26] <s1rcuit> if a whale were infected with the G virus we'd probably be fucked
[0:28:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is that what the tenacle boss was? Whale parasite?
[0:28:31] <TomFrank> i notice a lot of sound effects are from re4
[0:28:34] <Pwgregory> Wait...it‚Äôs dependent on the size of the being infected but there‚Äôs no limits on the size?
[0:28:40] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah, fuck CVX
[0:28:42] <%cowardman93> everything is better than CVX
[0:28:47] <+professormorrigan> cvx is butts

[0:28:50] <mattrutland> over CVX for Story?
[0:28:54] <+badjab326> This is my 3rd favorite RE
[0:28:59] <%NovaKnightmare> ha
[0:29:00] <%cowardman93> a dog turd in a box is better than CVX
[0:29:10] <%rytisone> it's a syrup
[0:29:11] <%InugamiTheHound> operation raccoon city and umbrella corps are better than CVX
[0:29:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is not an RE inventory screen.
[0:29:16] <Pwgregory> The best Die Hard you mean?
[0:29:20] <dullvivid> Chris is hacking the FBI on his 3DS @patstaresat
[0:29:26] <%D3rrtyD4n> @InugamiTheHound atpRtsd

[0:29:29] <%cowardman93> let's not be crazy now @InugamiTheHound
[0:29:35] <%MajorCrasher> this game is very mediocre but still better than CVX in every way

[0:29:41] <trianglehat> "narrow" so, a choke?
[0:29:41] <%happyface699> Die hard 3 is second best

[0:30:24] <%Mister_McDerp> computer expert chris
[0:30:25] <%cowardman93> well he was an air force pilot when he was 6
[0:30:26] <%Docblargle> that's ridiculous. clearly this room is just the pinnacle of architecture

[0:30:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh so this is how you do that Evil Within 2 room badly.
[0:30:42] <%Ran196> Only thing Chris can't do is play the piano and force Leon to bone Claire
[0:30:46] <Pwgregory> What happens if you shoot the glass? Does virus juice shoot up your bunghole?
[0:30:48] <%Jekado> he's gonna have to fight someone in here
[0:30:50] <%happyface699> This bit sucks
[0:30:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ah yes this room
[0:30:54] <%InugamiTheHound> @cowardman93 CVX sucks same with zero. I rather play those games instead. IMO outbreak file 1 and 2 are so damn good

[0:56:18] <%Keyd00d> Oh you mean all Jessicas
[0:56:18] <faithless_zealot> Witha name like Jessica, who would have though!
[0:56:20] <Dragovus> She was trying to cheat on Tony
[0:56:20] <%AncelDeLambert> WOMEN. ARE. EVIL.
[0:56:20] <%Dementedpenguin> This scene was 1000% avoidable
[0:56:21] <%baronblank> curse her sudden yet inevitable betrayal

[0:56:22] <CosmosDeity> Typical Jessica
[0:56:23] <theKingRamses> rip parker
[0:56:23] <M4T1A5> Actually knowing what happens in the end that scene doesn't make any sense
[0:56:23] <%theAncopro> cant spell evil without jessicaevil
[0:56:23] <%cowardman93> IS JESSICA BEING EVIL THE REVELATION?
[0:56:24] <%InugamiTheHound> will Jessica get killed by Racheal?
[0:56:24] <%rytisone> Jessica wait!
[0:56:25] <%krawtch> the last few are super short
[0:56:25] <%Sir_stride> this game is too damn long
[0:56:26] <Psych_man13_13> But why?
[0:56:26] <YamadaZero> Jessica did nothing wrong, Pat.
[0:56:27] <%valriot> White Ada isn't leaving much of an impact
[0:56:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Is there a woman? Evil.
[0:56:30] <%Typhaeon> RIP Big Carlos

[0:56:59] <%happyface699> YES
[0:57:00] <+NitronStreams> The answer is us for indulging this game
[0:57:00] <YamadaZero> Jessica is just doing her job. Not her fault Porker is an idiot.
[0:57:02] <M4T1A5> Now the ships is extra sinking
[0:57:03] <%Aracon_> this is now all parker's fault
[0:57:05] <%SoFarFetched> WAIT

[0:57:41] <Aydarkzero> ggwp
[0:57:42] <karl_rex> Who is this Christopher Lee looking mf?
[0:57:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> CANNOT BE ABORTED atpRtsd
[0:57:47] <AnacondaVirtue> do you know how MANY times these people have escaped self-destructs
[0:57:48] <Coystick> "Ah yes, the proud Queen Seramaisfnfgsdkdniufgdmis"
[0:57:49] <%Jekado> when has a self destruct anything killed an RE hero tho?
[0:57:50] <%SaiyanShoto> So he showed them that to spoop them?
[0:57:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, question: if Pat played Revelations 2, who should play the little girl? Pat or Paige?
[0:57:51] <pixelkenj> but did they have a virus factory on that ship too??
[0:57:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why does Self Destruct not have a abrotion feature
[0:57:58] <gade177> No not at all.
[0:57:58] <%krawtch> why did he even reveal himself
[0:57:58] <%Sir_stride> like a boulder
[0:57:58] <%happyface699> @desertpenguin So same people
[0:57:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and LADY
[0:58:02] <%Aracon_> I am so confused
[0:58:03] <%cvp5127> ?
[0:58:10] <Shonen_hero> bitch Chris ain't going to die. He's basically a superhero
[0:58:11] <xeros720> we'll get you Goldman!
[0:58:13] <Pwgregory> Jill‚Äôs a lady.
[0:58:13] <Stab_master_ars0n> So is Parker super dead or not? Never played this one.
[0:58:16] <+DesertPenguin> Ha he slammed the door on you
[0:58:18] <Coystick> Finally, Jass
[0:58:20] <%BalloniWright> gentlemen? HotPokket
[0:58:21] <M4T1A5> No timer though
[0:58:23] <%cowardman93> Chris and Jill as a team seems unstoppable
[0:58:23] <pixelkenj> woah camera shakes!!!
[0:58:24] <+bitwolf> RE protagonists have self-destruct immunity
[0:58:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YO ITS KIRK
[0:58:26] <%Dingus_Tickler> Jill's ass atpGasm
[0:58:27] <Vikken141> KIRK
[0:58:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Stab_master_ars0n You'll...lots of fakeouts
[0:58:29] <%krawtch> noted chivalrist Chris Redfield
[0:58:29] <%SoFarFetched> CHRIS STOP CLOSING THE DOOR ON JILL
[0:58:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> KIRK
[0:58:31] <Pwgregory> Kirk!
[0:58:32] <alexandrecau> no one died, even rachel is alive
[0:58:33] <%Docblargle> god damn, chris keeps shutting the door in your face
[0:58:37] <%walternatorz> wtf, why is chris shutting the door
[0:58:37] <%DracaenaLeaf> Chris loves slamming the door haha
[0:58:38] <42nfl19> I blinked, are the chuckle brothers dead?
[0:58:39] <mattrutland> Chris, stop slamming the doors in my face you A-hole!!
[0:58:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Stab_master_ars0n *see
[0:58:45] <%happyface699> THE SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED
[0:58:46] <gade177> Yay a running sequence with no time limit...
[0:58:48] <Coystick> No i see jill's ass
[0:58:50] <%espanishcanamurciana> chris is being quite rude w those doors
[0:58:51] <yourliteraldog> More dumb shit in a RE game perish the thought
[0:58:54] <pixelkenj> thanks pequod
[0:58:55] <%krawtch> because then you'd just turn it off
[0:58:56] <Shonen_hero> unabortable
[0:58:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ITS KIRK BEFORE HE DIES IN RE5
[0:58:56] <%Aracon_> no :)
[0:58:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yes
[0:58:57] <+DesertPenguin> Y'know, just in case?
[0:58:58] <%ElenaManetta> no
[0:58:59] <rcand9> no
[0:59:00] <%Mister_McDerp> that would be a huge design flaw too
[0:59:01] <+snausages_> Because it's like Alien
[0:59:01] <%Keyd00d> no
[0:59:02] <Dr_Mooose> no chickening out
[0:59:03] <trianglehat> can't be patched
[0:59:03] <%trustycoyote> YES! Engineering 101
[0:59:04] <%Shadowpint> What the fuck could Episode 12 possibly be and what purpose could it serve at this point
[0:59:05] <%miguelrod777> Destroy evidence maybe?
[0:59:05] <karl_rex> NO TAKE BACKS
[0:59:06] <%ElenaManetta> why would you want to abort a nuke, that's stupid
[0:59:07] <%Ner234> For cowards yeah
[0:59:10] <M4T1A5> Well doesn't that defeat the whole point though
[0:59:10] <%consistentlylistless> Go big or go home
[0:59:11] <Shonen_hero> Get the wire hanger and abort that sequence
[0:59:11] <%cureneckbeard> no take backsies
[0:59:11] <Finaldragoon> oh hey it's the song that is used in Project X Zone
[0:59:13] <%cowardman93> SHUT UP is the reason
[0:59:16] <%Mister_McDerp> imagine accidentally blowing up the lab
[0:59:16] <%SaiyanShoto> And be a coward? No way!
[0:59:18] <%happyface699> I love aborting
[0:59:18] <CappuccinoGuil> What if Jimmy from accounting accidentally pressed the self-destruct button, huh?
[0:59:18] <%Keyd00d> Only cowards do that
[0:59:18] <%Ynkubus18> NO you gotta commit
[0:59:20] <%walternatorz> the zombies may be smart and learn how to use a computer
[0:59:20] <%afronooch> American made self destructs cant have aborts, cause the constitution
[0:59:22] <theKingRamses> they already pressed the button pat
[0:59:23] <%GorboMcDuggins> Especially when the self destruct is initiated by single button. What if an intern presses it by accident?
[0:59:25] <+tweedler92> Self destruct sequences are fucking stupid LUL
[0:59:25] <rcand9> dont pussy out
[0:59:25] <+broth_elemental> Especially since the self-destruct is activated by JUST A BIG BUTTON
[0:59:25] <+NitronStreams> BUT WHAT ABOUT THE EARTH SHATTERING KABOOM
[0:59:26] <%rytisone> there is no second guessing that
[0:59:26] <%D3rrtyD4n> rude
[0:59:26] <%Shadowthedigger> Cause usually for these things you turn it on when you know you want it gone
[0:59:27] <%ElenaManetta> going underwater in RE games feels weird
[0:59:30] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Because DRAMA, PAT
[0:59:32] <+DesertPenguin> ok?
[0:59:32] <HealingMind> Well, everyone not jill is gonna be a mega mutant
[0:59:32] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[0:59:33] <trianglehat> aborting self destruct is for quitters
[0:59:37] <%chhdez> You gotta place a lock on that button
[0:59:37] <%VashyronM> only cowards abort self destruct mechanisms
[0:59:38] <Wintorz> Pat is wearing blue fhaeUh
[0:59:39] <%krawtch> im sure that part will come in handy for the final boss
[0:59:44] <trulythedude> whoops
[0:59:45] <+azure22900> Like what if a dudes at the controls like sneeze, hits the button and like, welp guess we'll all die for nothing.
[0:59:46] <CraZ80> go big or go home!
[0:59:51] <%Sir_stride> nice FLCL shirt pat
[0:59:52] <%happyface699> Good work pat
[0:59:53] <Viny_Mars> Even that droid on the mando could abort its self destruction
[0:59:54] <+DesertPenguin> Aborting a nuke is what my mom called her pregnancy Ooooooooooooooooooo
[0:59:55] <%VashyronM> The Federation are made up of cowards
[0:59:56] <saiyan24675> Yeah it would be great in Metroid games if you can stop the countdown
[0:59:57] <%Dementedpenguin> Exactly, Picard is a coward.
[0:59:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Someone had a bad day, went postal, and hit the self-destruct. Guess the whole lab is a loss.
[0:59:58] <%Ner234> ???
[0:59:58] <%SaiyanShoto> Cowards!
[0:59:59] <+bitwolf> what happens if someone accidentally presses the self-destruct button?
[1:00:00] <AnacondaVirtue> 10 days a week, Patrick?
[1:00:00] <+lethallylactic> ???
[1:00:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no
[1:00:00] <mattrutland> you cant unabort an abortion.
[1:00:01] <%AdmiralButtloaf> lol
[1:00:01] <%D3rrtyD4n> thats right, 10 days a week
[1:00:01] <%Keyd00d> no
[1:00:01] <%lutefiiisk> peter parker
[1:00:02] <%tank7013> Were you ever?
[1:00:02] <Treuan> Just go with it
[1:00:02] <%SoFarFetched> ten days a week
[1:00:03] <%xxshadowxx416> no
[1:00:03] <%asgard147> no :)
[1:00:03] <rcand9> no
[1:00:04] <Shonen_hero> LUL
[1:00:04] <Coystick> A romulon week
[1:00:05] <+cowardman93> seriously Jill's ass is so huge it's like she stapled someone's legs onto her body
[1:00:06] <%tusk102> 10 DAYS
[1:00:06] <%GinAndRoses> Eight Days a Weeeeek
[1:00:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> Self destruct builders are anti-abortion
[1:00:07] <+NitronStreams> No thats right
[1:00:09] <%DarkestDawn64> Weeks are weird in the future
[1:00:10] <%TDotGoat> metric time
[1:00:10] <%ElenaManetta> self-destruct sequences in general are stupid because it's often for locations that are so big it would cause nearby disasters.
[1:00:11] <%InugamiTheHound> a ten day work week
[1:00:11] <Mariakko> Weeks are longer in space
[1:00:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> In space there could be more than 10 days in a week.
[1:00:12] <CappuccinoGuil> I can't believe they give you an ammo case at the last level LUL
[1:00:13] <%rytisone> Pat is from another planet
[1:00:15] <+Remery_> No, just say what's on your mind :)
[1:00:15] <pixelkenj> its been one week since you looked at me
[1:00:15] <%Docblargle> Pat has been infected by the fishing virus
[1:00:17] <+Felto3> fishing in 7 mins pat
[1:00:17] <DashXero> Whoops! Wesley rested his drink on the self destruct button again. Gotta abort that shit.
[1:00:18] <M4T1A5> Did you fish 10 days a week?
[1:00:18] <DraxTD> picard was like "I just need to blow this bitch up"
[1:00:19] <%happyface699> 20 days a day
[1:00:20] <%Mister_McDerp> fishing? what a boomer
[1:00:20] <%Piemen99> No
[1:00:21] <+FrostyAri> why the fuck would you make a self destruct button that can be accidentally pressed
[1:00:21] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Patrick "Fishes 10 Days A Week" Boyvin
[1:00:23] <%Sir_stride> thinking about them fish
[1:00:23] <+garagon31> Galactic week
[1:00:23] <%Katashi25> It depends on the self destruct sequence. if it's already slowly blowing up, theres really no turning back
[1:00:25] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> I like to imagine Jill in this life or death situation and her just thinking about fishing lmao
[1:00:26] <%tusk102> JILL THIS WAY
[1:00:26] <Basch71> times convoluted
[1:00:27] <Wintorz> Still haven't fished once colaBlank
[1:00:29] <+NitronStreams> Time is fluid in star trek
[1:00:30] <anAngryHamster> That's my favorite Beatles song
[1:00:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> who was that
[1:00:32] <Pwgregory> I can‚Äôt wait for the questions raised in this game to be answered in the sequel.
[1:00:34] <%D3rrtyD4n> wat
[1:00:34] <Shonen_hero> Peaches aren't real and I certainly can't eat them ten days a week
[1:00:34] <pixelkenj> loading quakes
[1:00:36] <gade177> DAD STOP HUMMING!!!
[1:00:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Teh FUCK

[1:00:44] <%rytisone> teleported
[1:00:44] <M4T1A5> Reasons
[1:00:44] <%Dementedpenguin> Parker continues to be stupid.
[1:00:45] <%Typhaeon> How the hell is he here
[1:00:46] <Captain_Joe1911> cakee5Tuntun
[1:00:46] <pixelkenj> explosion teleport

[1:00:48] <+bitwolf> how the hell did parket get there?
[1:00:49] <%baronblank> did he crawl down here?
[1:00:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> WTF
[1:00:50] <+DesertPenguin> Where was he seen last?
[1:00:51] <gade177> How?
[1:00:51] <%cvp5127> ??
[1:00:52] <rcand9> HOW
[1:00:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> FOR THE DRAMATIC SCENE UP AHEAD OF COURSE
[1:00:55] <%happyface699> Poka
[1:00:56] <+griffball13> IT"S FINE
[1:00:56] <CappuccinoGuil> FUCK YOUR GUNS, USE PISTOLS
[1:00:56] <Coystick> Quick support the fatass with your fat ass
[1:00:57] <rcand9> clone?
[1:00:57] <trianglehat> wait WHAT
[1:00:59] <%cowardman93> is that the script?
[1:00:59] <%camsool> how the hell did he get down there?
[1:01:00] <%tusk102> @DesertPenguin the bridge
[1:01:00] <%trustycoyote> Wait.... wasn't he like on the other side of the boat?!
[1:01:01] <+lethallylactic> JESSICAAAA
[1:01:01] <NocturnalScotsman> to tell em
[1:01:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> WAIT
[1:01:02] <trulythedude> suck my diiiiiiiick
[1:01:05] <%tank7013> Stupid powers?
[1:01:06] <%InugamiTheHound> how did he get down and how did he not bleed out?
[1:01:08] <+NitronStreams> Hee a trooper
[1:01:08] <yourliteraldog> They have a deal with the contractor. If they don't have that sequence then these labs would be too expensive to be viable.
[1:01:08] <pixelkenj> its a mimic!
[1:01:08] <%krawtch> TEH DRAMA tho
[1:01:09] <%BTRNDL> don't worry about it
[1:01:09] <%Dementedpenguin> But..... but CARRYING MECHANIC.
[1:01:09] <%Ran196> how?
[1:01:09] <M4T1A5> For this gameplaya part I guess
[1:01:10] <Drusain> Because he teleported
[1:01:11] <rcand9> he exploded too
[1:01:12] <%Rngiddion> did he crawl through the chest high water?
[1:01:12] <%tusk102> @trustycoyote yeah he was at the main deck
[1:01:12] <%asgard147> THAT WAS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SHIP FOR FUCKS SAKE!
[1:01:13] <%Rngiddion> what?
[1:01:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> THATS TAINTED WATER. AND HE HAS AN OPEN WOUND AND NO VACCINE
[1:01:15] <%ElkRiverDog> Plot teleport?
[1:01:15] <KingVeeo> what if there is only 1 boat reverse twist
[1:01:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's for drama
[1:01:15] <%shurtal> Little do anyone at the BSAA know, but Parker has Wesker's teleportation ability
[1:01:15] <mattrutland> she shot him with a teleportation bullet
[1:01:16] <CappuccinoGuil> FUCK YOU, IT'S DRAMA
[1:01:17] <%Kegeto> how you even got down here
[1:01:19] <%Aracon_> well now he's gonna die of an infection with all this dirty water
[1:01:19] <%happyface699> ITS FINE
[1:01:20] <+DesertPenguin> You're thinking too hard Pat, just shut up about it
[1:01:22] <%consistentlylistless> He fell down the plot chute
[1:01:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's for future drama

[1:03:21] <jeffishype> do you move faster while aiming?
[1:03:24] <%krawtch> chris is an award winning marksman, why would he miss the target
[1:03:27] <%Jekado> shouldn't big stronk chis be helping parker?
[1:03:28] <%rytisone> Parker had time to walk here, cause his sequence happened earlier than Jill and Chris
[1:03:30] <+Parrish_broadnax> Horror series btw

[1:03:39] <+Kilik_> how about big strong man carry him and you get out your actually useful guns
[1:03:44] <Shonen_hero> People will say 4 is the best, but honestly Resident Evil 2 remake is a really strong contender imo

[1:04:50] <+Brentsei> wait what why
[1:04:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I repeat, he is NOT dead.
[1:04:51] <%ElenaManetta> That wasn't all Chris
[1:04:52] <Sartastic> he's deeeeead
[1:04:53] <yourliteraldog> There is probably an official weight and bust size because this game is Japanese
[1:04:53] <TwinBat> there's two of you just lift him up
[1:04:53] <%Aracon_> yeah parker looked pretty fucking heavy
[1:04:54] <pixelkenj> but chris can punch big rock

[1:05:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> No one DIES in this game.
[1:05:05] <%tusk102> didn't show him burn he's still alive smh
[1:05:06] <%Laecerelius> This is what pushed Chris to over use steroids
[1:05:08] <%ForlornCarton> check edge for gun
[1:05:08] <%cowardman93> there's 2 of you and you're strong as shit
[1:05:10] <%Aracon_> but then again chris punches boulders
[1:05:10] <HyperBomb21> still alive
[1:05:11] <%ittla> rip that guy i guess
[1:05:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> I guess if she fell flat on her chest she could do it but it would pull a shoulder out weird
[1:05:12] <mattrutland> BOO
[1:05:14] <%Kegeto> well that was a waste
[1:05:14] <%Katashi25> bye Parker, see you in the Sequel as a bad guy resurrected
[1:05:15] <%Pesuto> This is before Chris punches boulders harder than he punches Wesker
[1:05:16] <%consistentlylistless> It's ok he fell down the other plot chute to safety
[1:05:18] <red_blaster> Everybody's favorite character is dead ;_;

[1:05:26] <%SilverDevilfish> MUH MEN
[1:05:27] <%Maids4lyfe> chris stop making friends
[1:05:27] <%rytyoung> Jill doesn't exist after this game in the franchise
[1:05:29] <%SoFarFetched> Chris can only be super strong when Plot calls for him
[1:05:30] <concretenj> why did they have him in this scene if he was gonna just die
[1:05:30] <rcand9> why didnt he die in the explosion in the first place???
[1:05:30] <%Aracon_> chris really only needs jill
[1:05:30] <%DowntownDrunk> such BS, resident evil is known for realism
[1:05:31] <%Mister_McDerp> hes a friendly guy

[1:05:42] <%Aracon_> he never shuts up about her
[1:05:43] <%BalloniWright> they are best friends
[1:05:43] <Pwgregory> Pat thinking that Jill Valentine is a normal human being...
[1:05:44] <+snausages_> RE4 really is the only good action RE
[1:05:45] <%ittla> chris has two good girlfriends, jill and sheva
[1:05:48] <%InugamiTheHound> chris and jill both failed parker and parker is is dumb for not trusting raymond and not shooting Jessica!!!
[1:05:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Wait, I forgot, can't you add gun mods at the box?
[1:05:50] <%ittla> he should really hang out with them more

[1:05:58] <%D3rrtyD4n> timer decided to kick in
[1:06:01] <mattrutland> Why does everyone i love die from being close to me in my zombie hunting job??!?!
[1:06:02] <zk_nails> Chris' only friends are his guns and muscles
[1:06:02] <%Maids4lyfe> Pierce is a bio electric goo monsters in the bottom of the ocean
[1:06:03] <CraZ80> "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOR?!!"
[1:06:07] <%SilverDevilfish> The rule is if you have a penis don't go near Chris or you die
[1:06:15] <%cowardman93> man why wouldn't Chris hang out with both Jill and Barry. The 2 people he was friends with for YEARS
[1:06:18] <%Huntercd> Sex friends with Jill
[1:06:19] <silverira> isn't Chris mad at RE6 because of the amnesia?
[1:06:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> Curiously attractive.

[1:09:09] <Darren716> Wait then what the fuck does Rebecca weigh?
[1:09:10] <%king_wragles> To be 115 pounds and look like that, she would need less than 0% body fat

[1:12:41] <%ElenaManetta> I gotta go out in the freezing cold to buy a light bulb but i GOTTA see if Jill and Chris rescue the pilot
[1:12:44] <+DesertPenguin> Now I can see how RE7 final boss fight is a copy of this in a way. Giant tentacle monster
[1:12:47] <%Kegeto> is laughably bad

[1:16:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Why are you applying logic to a game series such as Resident Evil?
[1:16:04] <%Sneakman98> @PatStaresAt That's because ever since Resident Evil 4 they've been ripping off Parasite
[1:16:04] <%Kegeto> agreed

[1:16:11] <Ordinary_Who> zombies have big breakfasts, my dude
[1:16:12] <+DesertPenguin> They're just reproducing their cells at an exponential rate. It's just accelerated growth
[1:16:13] <%worldbrand> all of the carbon in a tree comes from the air. think about that.
[1:16:13] <%ittla> the cells reproduce REALLY FAST okay
[1:16:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> this is like universal studios or some shit
[1:16:15] <%ElenaManetta> well it is!
[1:16:15] <SkyPirateArcane> The amount of heat that would be dispersed from those virus transforms would combust anything near it
[1:16:16] <Sapphire_Breeze> THEY ARE MAGIC
[1:16:17] <%ElenaManetta> It's sci-nonsense
[1:16:19] <%cureneckbeard> They're in a helicopter. That's dangerous in a RE
[1:16:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt You think that is eqgregious you should see the nonsense with Energy regarding zombies!
[1:16:19] <%JJCheeker> penis boss
[1:16:20] <Ether101_Prime> How much of this story does Pat know?
[1:16:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> The BIOCURSE is drawing from the MEAT DIMENSION
[1:16:20] <%Sir_stride> like how Simmons became a fucking tiger, t rex and then giant fly?
[1:16:21] <Coystick> I think the only time "giant zombie monster" has ever done it for me was Grandma for RE7 they did her scale well.
[1:16:22] <%jorgamund> they're just converting energy into mass, what's so magical about that Kappa
[1:16:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> I appreciated that in RE7 they straight up say they have no idea how Evelyn was creating so much mass
[1:16:24] <%spiritofmojave> Remember when this wasn't a marine biology series
[1:16:24] <ThorgrimFunhammer> it's a curse remember
[1:16:27] <+DesertPenguin> It's literally accelerated cell growth
[1:16:27] <Pwgregory> Kirk dodged all this shit but gets taken out by one rocket.
[1:16:27] <%toolofparanoia> its the Warp
[1:16:27] <%Sneakman98> That's because they are ripping off Parasyte
[1:16:29] <s1rcuit> BIO CURSE
[1:16:29] <+RayMan799> Thats what I like about the flood in halo. Everything about them is about them having enough biomass to grow
[1:16:31] <%D3rrtyD4n> we on a roller coaster
[1:16:31] <xeros720> science magic
[1:16:32] <%Mister_McDerp> I'd love a resident evil game that decides to throw in magic shit
[1:16:32] <Drusain> How exciting
[1:16:32] <%TDotGoat> just... fly away
[1:16:34] <+FrostyAri> ah yes, please tell me more about how Resident Evil is unrealistic
[1:16:34] <%dreu81> It was ok for birkin because he wasn‚Äôt the size of a building
[1:16:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Is this Darkside Chronicles lol
[1:16:36] <BoBoCatBurger> @PatStaresAt i always thought of it as magic tumors
[1:16:37] <%SilverDevilfish> "Imma dog, now imma T-rex, now I'm fuckin' Beezlebub." - Simmons
[1:16:39] <Mexrage> seeing how fast they melt or evaporate, i asume it is very low density, high volume biomass
[1:16:41] <yourliteraldog> B.O.W can readily violate the Laws of Conservation of Mass and Energy. SO yeah they magic.
[1:16:44] <%RowenCleric> you can kinda blame Akira for that honestly it did the mass out of nothing first @PatStaresAt
[1:16:45] <bear_breaker20> just think of it like a fleshy biollante
[1:16:45] <%happyface699> RIVETING
[1:16:46] <%toolofparanoia> Its demons
[1:16:50] <%Dementedpenguin> This is basically an R-Type boss
[1:16:50] <%sniffy77> pilot dude needs to gtfo away from the zombie whale
[1:16:51] <+WarbossMetal> Couldnt Eveline from RE7 make bio-goo from nothing too?
[1:16:52] <%krawtch> imagine if this was your first RE game you ever played and you got to this garbage
[1:16:53] <+azure22900> Yeah like G virus I would give a pass, as its some sort of deformed cell division and the creature just gets more fucked up as it evolves
[1:16:53] <%denmonari> Why isnt the chopper just keeping its distance and be completely safe?
[1:16:53] <CraZ80> Turret Sections in RE really suck
[1:16:55] <%Keyd00d> there's like 50 parasites
[1:16:56] <+DesertPenguin> You would think some other country in the world would notice this thing and try to figure out what it is
[1:16:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah there's TOO many wormies in this whale.
[1:17:00] <%saadi90> It looked arright on the 3ds
[1:17:01] <%Rngiddion> how the actual fuck is this still going?
[1:17:01] <Ether101_Prime> Does this game have Co-Op?
[1:17:03] <%Typhaeon> How was Re:Re2 so much better than this
[1:17:03] <%ElenaManetta> I think its part of why I like Evil Within and Silent Hill a bit more than RE world because those two former things admit, "Yeah this is dumb magic mental bulldshit and makes no sense"
[1:17:04] <%Maids4lyfe> it's dead
[1:17:08] <+Parrish_broadnax> its just a Tumor
[1:17:10] <%vectorless_peon> Concervation of mass is not a rule RE has followed consistantly
[1:17:11] <%consistentlylistless> How is this still not done
[1:17:12] <%Jekado> if one helicopter with 2 miniguns can take this out T abyss seems like a failure
[1:17:13] <HealingMind> It's just vibing
[1:17:15] <%Meekest> And they keep on comin and they don't stop comin
[1:17:15] <%D3rrtyD4n> its time to stop atpCap
[1:17:16] <%Agami23> its just a kinda sad whale
[1:17:17] <alexandrecau> it's a tube
[1:17:18] <pixelkenj> its a deviljho mouth
[1:17:20] <SPKTR34> the dumb anime shit is a staple of resident evil
[1:17:20] <AnacondaVirtue> Please end
[1:17:23] <bleugh> is this on a loop
[1:17:23] <%TDotGoat> this blows
[1:17:25] <%denmonari> it's just a big sad water Deviljho
[1:17:26] <%Mister_McDerp> are we done yet?
[1:17:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just shoot missiles at it from 10 miles away.
[1:17:28] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt at least in RE7 they were like "evelyn making all this mass makes no sense wtf"
[1:17:28] <KingVeeo> why is there so many
[1:17:28] <pixelkenj> sad deviljho
[1:17:29] <Shonen_hero> Yeah Resident Evil pretends this is all science based horror
[1:17:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Or Conservation of Energy
[1:17:30] <%krawtch> it could just be a big barrel with parasite snakes coming out
[1:17:32] <Shonen_hero> or the square cube law
[1:17:33] <%Kegeto> whale
[1:17:36] <%Docblargle> yeah, this is very much just a ball of parasites in a trench coat
[1:17:37] <%Keyd00d> no
[1:17:40] <%Maids4lyfe> the virus turns the flesh into super cancer so it keeps growing uncontrollably
[1:17:40] <redrins> wesker opened the game
[1:17:42] <redrins> gate
[1:17:43] <silverira> can we play RE6 now.?.. I know it not good but boy I think its better than this
[1:17:43] <%Keyd00d> BLOOD SMOKE
[1:17:43] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[1:17:44] <%Ner234> This sequence should've ended like five minutes ago
[1:17:44] <%MayShip> there's gonna be a lot of dead giant worms in the ocean
[1:17:45] <+Parrish_broadnax> how has the ship not tipped over or sunk
[1:17:47] <%ittla> at least the G virus takes a long time to become huge
[1:17:48] <%Cn_alpha_02> All that infected blood falling in the ocean.
[1:17:48] <%denmonari> FARTING PICKLE
[1:17:48] <Vikken141> blow hole
[1:17:51] <+nictron90> watch out for that poo gas

[1:17:58] <mobius_won> Looks like a deviljho ate Jhen mohran
[1:17:59] <%ElenaManetta> Did Pat know it was gonna make a fart sound when he said that
[1:18:00] <rcand9> poor whale
[1:18:00] <yourliteraldog> Its a sea cucumber that farts
[1:18:02] <SailingSaturn> Is this Just Graboids? cirThink

[1:18:11] <%tusk102> wow
[1:18:11] <$ItsRatman> THE ONION
[1:18:11] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Is this why Paige checks her burgers for worms?
[1:18:11] <%jorgamund> it's simple: the viruses figured out a way to convert energy into mass
[1:18:12] <RatherUninteresting> so many centipedes
[1:18:13] <%Keyd00d> that loading screen
[1:18:13] <mattrutland> HAMMER OF DAWN??

[1:18:34] <%JD_Lars> It‚Äôs just sea Tremors. There‚Äôs even a guy named Bert.
[1:18:35] <+broth_elemental> Just dropping this thing into the ocean seems ill advised
[1:18:35] <%dalishprince> we saved the world :)
[1:18:36] <%Kegeto> it so bad
[1:18:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> THERE IS SO MUCH VIRUS LEAKING INTO THE OCEAN

[1:18:51] <%Sneakman98> Poor Kirk is gonna die in RE 5

[1:18:52] <+Parrish_broadnax> Nuke the Ocean
[1:18:52] <M4T1A5> but guns solve all the problems
[1:18:53] <Louie_Salmon> We have to bleach the ocean
[1:18:54] <bigbrothergannon> that face rig suc
[1:18:54] <%spiritofmojave> OCEAN IS ZOMBIE
[1:18:55] <EuropanLamprey> Don't worry, Ocean Currents are just a myth

[1:18:56] <HyperBomb21> COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION
[1:18:57] <SPKTR34> YOU MEAN LIKE IN RE6?
[1:18:57] <+azure22900> That was ONE infested WHALE as well.
[1:18:57] <AnacondaVirtue> This is literally all your fault
[1:18:57] <TakesGuts> the ocean is big tho
[1:18:58] <%Mister_McDerp> just vaccinate the fish
[1:18:59] <mobius_won> Just dump vaccine in the ocean
[1:18:59] <%tusk102> yeah right
[1:19:01] <Ether101_Prime> Remember that one time the BSAA decided to using a railgun on New York city?
[1:19:02] <Ion_Laser> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT USE BLEACH OR WHATEVER
[1:19:02] <%Dementedpenguin> Did that ass get bigger?

[1:19:03] <karl_rex> Goodbye fishing industry!
[1:19:05] <%sniffy77> i don't think a nuke would stop this stuff
[1:19:06] <+bitwolf> the ocean may have virus. but not the land. so it's okay
[1:19:07] <%JJCheeker> It's alright the plankton will eat it
[1:19:08] <Aydarkzero> WHAT

[1:19:17] <%tusk102> HERE WE GO
[1:19:19] <%miguelrod777> More?!
[1:19:19] <Pwgregory> He did all this to uncover ONE mole.
[1:19:20] <%Shacklebox> it's so hard to care about anything they're saying
[1:19:21] <Ether101_Prime> I'm sure these games are canon.
[1:19:21] <clonexsniperx> nah all that fish piss is more powerful
[1:19:21] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ONE MORE SUCK LEVEL
[1:19:21] <%Shadowpint> This is canon, though
[1:19:22] <%lutefiiisk> THE BAD GAME!
[1:19:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> @PatStaresAt I want to point out that Parker had a bullet wound going through the infected soup when Jill found him
[1:19:22] <Louie_Salmon> Man that is an intense hourglass figure
[1:19:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[1:19:23] <+professormorrigan> Revelations isn't canon?
[1:19:24] <%Aracon_> this game is awful
[1:19:24] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[1:19:25] <%rytyoung> holy fuck anyone actually know what the end credits for this game is about?
[1:19:25] <Ketronox> Aren't all the RE games full of nonsense? Why is this one any different?
[1:19:25] <%jorgamund> "yeah... my bad fam"
[1:19:26] <%Ilpala> WAS THAT NOT THE END??
[1:19:26] <xeros720> good job pat
[1:19:27] <Shonen_hero> Good
[1:19:27] <%Jekado> your memory
[1:19:27] <+dredayy56> Oh let's just ignore that the science to bring back the dead exists
[1:19:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> What?
[1:19:27] <%SoFarFetched> Taths fair
[1:19:29] <trianglehat> head non-canon
[1:19:29] <%SoFarFetched> thats*
[1:19:29] <+DesertPenguin> Why was it in the first place?
[1:19:30] <+Parrish_broadnax> No way
[1:19:30] <%Sir_stride> also, are we just gonna forget the space laser?
[1:19:31] <+lethallylactic> FeelsBadMan
[1:19:32] <$Hommando> It is canon though
[1:19:32] <%Jekado> remove the game from your memory
[1:19:33] <+Parrish_broadnax> its so canon
[1:19:34] <%happyface699> Boo
[1:19:34] <Marpolo13> the WHOLE thing was we CANT let the bioevil into the ocean. BUUUT THEN LUL
[1:19:35] <%Kegeto> same
[1:19:35] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt like CVX?
[1:19:36] <%rytyoung> yeah it's not canon at all
[1:19:37] <%Mister_McDerp> theres no way it is
[1:19:37] <+dante_must_die_exe> it can be tho
[1:19:37] <%theAncopro> but then chris never grabs Jills but
[1:19:37] <Shonen_hero> Yeah fuck this is nonsense
[1:19:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> keep in mind Rev2 actually references Terragregia
[1:19:40] <yourliteraldog> If the virus could covert energy to mass the surrounding would be frozen over. Which would be a cool premise for RE4
[1:19:41] <%ShichiNoBushi> Head canon?
[1:19:41] <gade177> Yeah good choice.
[1:19:41] <%D3rrtyD4n> rev2 way better
[1:19:42] <Shonen_hero> It's like NIGHT AND DAY
[1:19:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it's fine they never mention it again anyway
[1:19:43] <+azure22900> Rev 1 non canon, Rev 2 super canon
[1:19:44] <%Maids4lyfe> CVX was a better story
[1:19:45] <%rytyoung> its major nonsense
[1:19:45] <xeros720> it is "canon"
[1:19:47] <%cureneckbeard> I could believe all the giant monster shit, but how do you explain Jill's ass
[1:19:49] <+professormorrigan> Rev2 references rev1
[1:19:49] <+NitronStreams> I dont think this game is even canon in rev2
[1:19:49] <%MajorCrasher> nah chat, there's like another hour left
[1:19:50] <yourliteraldog> I mean RE 8
[1:19:51] <superchronicc> just because it doesnt live up to your expectations?
[1:19:52] <comicalmond9135> BIO TERROR
[1:19:53] <%MayShip> which kind of sucks for it
[1:19:53] <MalignantUpper> canon erasure
[1:19:54] <%Aphex_0> I'm so glad I'm drunk enough to forget this
[1:19:54] <trianglehat> tiny hat
[1:19:54] <+professormorrigan> so its canon surely
[1:20:02] <+Clik404> The final boss is fucking insane by the way, get ready to see that game over a bunch
[1:20:03] <%optimasmaximas> lil hat PogChamp
[1:20:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> okay SPAI

[1:21:45] <%BalloniWright> Japan FailFish
[1:21:47] <$SuperiorDelta> Wait, if the virus in this game is a special one that makes weird sea creature type *** why are normal Hunters here?
[1:21:48] <alexandrecau> @Pnutz409 stalker fan
[1:21:48] <%krawtch> Jessica has a tiny hat so you should probably hear her out and not jump to conclusions.
[1:21:49] <Sartastic> he's got that hot evil ginger energy
[1:21:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[1:21:56] <%tusk102> kill hunters with a fucking pistol idiot
[1:21:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> what a fun section
[1:21:58] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[1:21:59] <Coystick> Why invest untold billions to create frog monsters that a pistol can defeat??
[1:22:04] <trianglehat> so much "content"
[1:22:05] <Pnutz409> thanks chat. I figured but i was like... this is new.
[1:22:06] <%D3rrtyD4n> why are they making us do this evo19MindBlown
[1:22:06] <%espanishcanamurciana> wiat why didn't the game end after the final boss?
[1:22:06] <%rytyoung> yeah it's super rough
[1:22:09] <yourliteraldog> It be cool if the villian of this game was K.Rool
[1:22:10] <pixelkenj> this multi billion dollar island being wiped out had no impact on the economy
[1:22:11] <spacechannel4> Pat melee lol, axe
[1:22:12] <%Mister_McDerp> pistol > bioweapon
[1:22:13] <gade177> There's zero reason why he shouldn't be dead right now.
[1:22:13] <King_Kth> He's fine
[1:22:14] <Captain_Joe1911> cakee5Tuntun
[1:22:15] <%ShichiNoBushi> Parker: "Oops. I shot you Jessica."
[1:22:15] <%ittla> did you just go from final boss to shooting at shitty hunters with a bb gun
[1:22:15] <+lethallylactic> Honestly, Umbrella should have just quit while they were ahead when they made the Hunters.
[1:22:16] <+RayDaug> Remember when Hunters were threatening? Like "Oh shit, A hunter!"
[1:22:20] <%roxikat> Conan O'Brien?
[1:22:21] <yourliteraldog> CONAN
[1:22:22] <%krawtch> hope that's not Raymond's blood
[1:22:23] <%MayShip> "i'll be fine. OWWWW"
[1:22:23] <%D3rrtyD4n> just show us a cutscene
[1:22:25] <Shonen_hero> That is too much blood to lose
[1:22:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they looove it
[1:22:27] <+charlieroday> this looks grreeeeeeeaaattt
[1:22:28] <%TDotGoat> "somebody"
[1:22:28] <Timurine> SOMEBODY
[1:22:28] <%optimasmaximas> @espanishcanamurciana cuz that wasnt the final boss LUL
[1:22:29] <%sjay449> Conan no!
[1:22:29] <Shonen_hero> He should be fucking dead
[1:22:30] <+IShadowStrykerI> to be honest RE seems like it stopped caring about its story after RE4
[1:22:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> DRAMA
[1:22:33] <Pnutz409> so stan is a big fan... like cry boy band kind of fan
[1:22:34] <+NitronStreams> This truly was the survival horror
[1:22:36] <%roxikat> Team CoCo
[1:22:37] <+Parrish_broadnax> Who likes these
[1:22:37] <spacechannel4> Nvm lol other skin. Feelsbad
[1:22:37] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the amount of blood on the wall from him would fucking kill a person if they lost it
[1:22:39] <+Parrish_broadnax> stop doing this
[1:22:40] <%asgard147> Is that your blood dude? I don't think you'll be fine limesS
[1:22:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> History, REPEATING itself.
[1:22:43] <Zeldrick> "Somebody lend him a shoulder" speaking to the only other person there.

[1:23:14] <SailingSaturn> Gotta Save Conan cirBaka
[1:23:15] <%theAncopro> Brain blast

[1:23:19] <Sapphire_Breeze> WAKE UP TO JUSTICE
[1:23:20] <%rytisone> woken up to justice
[1:23:21] <Coystick> These male asses are less pleasing than Jill's
[1:23:22] <42nfl19> Wait I thought Parker was also shot?
[1:23:23] <%sniffy77> dude theres zombie monsters running around. it's okay to say fuck
[1:23:23] <+NitronStreams> Gotta wake up to justice
[1:23:23] <%Sir_stride> who the fuck says blast it ?
[1:23:25] <%sjay449> There are so many bio-terrorists in RE. It's crazy
[1:23:26] <%ElenaManetta> This music is really sad
[1:23:28] <%baronblank> wow this sucks
[1:23:30] <%ElenaManetta> Or somber, rather
[1:23:32] <%SoFarFetched> @DaBigVitus He's doing RE6 after by popular vote.
[1:23:35] <%Mister_McDerp> god this game is bad
[1:23:37] <42nfl19> oh flashback
[1:23:39] <%valkuma> This guy is all over the fucking place
[1:23:39] <%Agami23> every time they say terragresia im reminded about terrasave and it upsets me
[1:23:39] <%krawtch> remember when Hunters popped out and went BOO
[1:23:40] <%Shacklebox> like him?
[1:23:42] <+Parrish_broadnax> Lady. Keep firing!
[1:23:44] <%sjay449> Veltro, Neo-Umbrella, The Connections, etc
[1:23:49] <Pnutz409> @alexandrecau Oooohhhhh ok... now i get it. man thats crazy.
[1:23:49] <%valkuma> "We need to go save more people" " leave me behind to die" What is his fucking motivation
[1:23:51] <%Owkono> peekaboo
[1:23:55] <gade177> Yeah like Parker.
[1:23:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this game loooves its flashbacks. And yeah, they did.
[1:23:56] <DaBigVitus> @SoFarFetched oh...that's a shame LUL
[1:23:57] <SailingSaturn> Is Pat gonna fuck that ladies Hat? cirISee
[1:23:58] <pixelkenj> Ooops all Hunters
[1:24:01] <%ElenaManetta> And the hunters show up during dialogue
[1:24:02] <%Aracon_> yeah
[1:24:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> @sjay449 connections is the re7 one?
[1:24:03] <+Parrish_broadnax> Jessica shoots and then stares at you
[1:24:04] <%ElenaManetta> It kills the mood
[1:24:06] <%Aracon_> it was a strange time
[1:24:08] <King_Kth> Oh shit that flip tho
[1:24:10] <+WarbossMetal> Yeah but RE6 is garbo
[1:24:10] <Dr_Mooose> eww fast zombies
[1:24:10] <%krawtch> C-virus makes better zombies i guess
[1:24:13] <%Maids4lyfe> I hate fast zombies
[1:24:13] <ambadev> Dem flip+s
[1:24:16] <%RowenCleric> lickers have always been > hunters
[1:24:16] <%ShichiNoBushi> They're overused like Pyramid Head.
[1:24:18] <%isolex_> why do they melt
[1:24:19] <%ittla> lmao what was that death animation
[1:24:21] <%SoFarFetched> @DaBigVitus Think he will start on Rev 2 after Doom or RE3Make though
[1:24:22] <trianglehat> that deflate is goofy
[1:24:22] <Coystick> I'm really looking forward to RE6
[1:24:22] <superchronicc> hunters, just add water
[1:24:24] <%sjay449> @Sapphire_Breeze yeah
[1:24:25] <%TDotGoat> bloody meetings
[1:24:26] <+lethallylactic> I hate how they melt into torsos. Or melt at all.
[1:24:27] <HyperBomb21> RE2 remake zombies are great
[1:24:27] <Sapphire_Breeze> @isolex_ there is no time
[1:24:28] <%Sir_stride> and then RE2 remake perfected zombies and everyone was happy
[1:24:28] <mattrutland> @RowenCleric Truth!
[1:24:28] <Shonen_hero> zombambos aren't dumb enough
[1:24:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> who cares about zombies
[1:24:35] <Iggeh0> you can't escape RE6 forever coward
[1:24:35] <%sjay449> The guys Lucas works for
[1:24:35] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt "let's take these super tough super expensive monsters in canon and just make them generic enemies"
[1:24:35] <+Kriptin> SUPER RUNNY JUMP ZAMBOS
[1:24:36] <%Sir_stride> man. re2 remake is great
[1:24:38] <BanSenpai> wait why does this look so good, i thought this was a super old game
[1:24:40] <42nfl19> Huh, they bring back Parker in a Manga where he works with Claire.
[1:24:43] <%sjay449> Then there is Blue Umbrella
[1:24:44] <%vectorless_peon> Hunters are trash mobs in this game
[1:24:47] <M4T1A5> RE2 remake probaably has best zombies
[1:24:49] <%happyface699> Even 7 didn‚Äôt have zombies
[1:24:51] <Drusain> Because making multiple zombie models is expensive
[1:24:53] <%sjay449> There are like 2-3 different Umbrella's
[1:24:54] <%Jekado> I like how your have a side story where all 3 people here are dead
[1:24:56] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt he has 0 blood on his model
[1:24:57] <%ElenaManetta> Wait does RE still even use zombies anymore? RE7 doesn't have zombies, does it?
[1:24:57] <s1rcuit> anyone else remember the gross bone zombies from earlier in the game? me neither
[1:24:59] <superchronicc> that dude has a scarecrow face
[1:25:00] <%jorgamund> Pat defines progress by adversity
[1:25:05] <%Keyd00d> Very safe
[1:25:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he's not
[1:25:06] <Ether101_Prime> RE6 did comical action zombies that did that silly leap thing like the one did at the start of Majima's section of Dead Souls.
[1:25:06] <%Mister_McDerp> shut up
[1:25:06] <%espanishcanamurciana> Revelations turned hunters into jobbers :(
[1:25:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> how is the game still going
[1:25:08] <%Docblargle> don't worry about it
[1:25:09] <pixelkenj> at least let him inside
[1:25:10] <SweetCuppingCake> the door will help
[1:25:12] <+bubblebasspickles> its fine
[1:25:14] <Shonen_hero> no it's fine shut up
[1:25:14] <%miguelrod777> shut up
[1:25:15] <%krawtch> SHUT UP.
[1:25:16] <%ElenaManetta> They're just being nice. They plan on leaving him
[1:25:17] <%tusk102> shut up
[1:25:18] <trianglehat> shut up Pat
[1:25:18] <+azure22900> Long corridor, with a wall at his back
[1:25:18] <yourliteraldog> Jessica's arm band is making uncomfortable. I worried she is going to start shouting about genes and shit
[1:25:18] <Sapphire_Breeze> shut up
[1:25:18] <King_Kth> He'll be fine
[1:25:19] <%SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta 7 was molded so yeah they've been changing up the enemies
[1:25:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat ammo
[1:25:21] <superchronicc> SHUT UP
[1:25:23] <Timurine> Item
[1:25:24] <%Keyd00d> Absolutely safe hallway
[1:25:24] <trianglehat> it's fine
[1:25:24] <%Jekado> also do hunters also suck because they can't open doors?
[1:25:25] <mattrutland> No its Fine Tho!
[1:25:26] <Ether101_Prime> Missed some ammo.
[1:25:27] <Sapphire_Breeze> don't worry about it
[1:25:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> shhhhh
[1:25:29] <M4T1A5> Plota rmor
[1:25:30] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt i wouldn't worry about it
[1:25:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> back in the boardroom
[1:25:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> He'd be safer stuffed in one of those lockers.
[1:25:35] <silverira> BIO SAFE
[1:25:37] <%Kegeto> jessica purple stocking is gone
[1:25:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> Wait these are the exact same levels as before aren't they
[1:25:40] <%walternatorz> coference room table
[1:25:42] <%DracaenaLeaf> in the room you pased there was ammo, not this one
[1:25:43] <Khorneflakes_> You know Pat """SAFE"""
[1:25:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> boardroom table
[1:25:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just think back to Jill's ass and all will be better.
[1:25:49] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Ammo on the table you walked past Pat
[1:25:50] <%ElenaManetta> uhhh WOW THE STORY
[1:25:52] <Ether101_Prime> There is ammo here but you missed some after Raymond.
[1:25:52] <%ElenaManetta> rude
[1:25:55] <%Ran196> He's in a dead end, so he sees everybody coming
[1:25:55] <%ElenaManetta> skipping through FLAVOR TEXT
[1:25:59] <%espanishcanamurciana> raymond protag for RE8
[1:25:59] <BigManLugan> why cant they just use an herb on him
[1:26:03] <%espanishcanamurciana> canon
[1:26:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @krawtch It kinda does from a logistics standpoint. Zombies can only be infected by gas they have hyper metabolisms so they die out in a few hours. So you get a crowd of zombies that swarm enemies that then die in a few days for quick clean up
[1:26:14] <%Sir_stride> same
[1:26:15] <%Keyd00d> same
[1:26:20] <Shonen_hero> I kinda want Jessica and Ada to get into a big dumb spy fight with gadgets and shit
[1:26:23] <%ElenaManetta> You were thinking about how dumb it was that this area is safe for some reason
[1:26:25] <%ShichiNoBushi> Camoflaged.
[1:26:25] <+joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Your brain is stupid
[1:26:29] <%tusk102> hunters in the old games: take 2-3 grenade rounds to kill Hunters here: 1 single pistol magazine
[1:26:30] <%sjay449> Shame confession... I only bought this game in 2012 when I was still a teenager because of Jill's ass in 3D.
[1:26:41] <%sjay449> This games not good
[1:26:42] <%Sir_stride> wow all empty?
[1:26:43] <trianglehat> who else whould she mean?
[1:26:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeayeayea
[1:26:45] <%Keyd00d> yeah I want jessica and ada to get in a "fight" too
[1:26:46] <%krawtch> Parker loves his hazing
[1:26:47] <yourliteraldog> Dose Re 8 have to be racially insensitive for Sheva to come back?
[1:26:47] <mattrutland> Hot Spy Cat Fight? Yes please @Shonen_hero
[1:26:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> okay Jessica
[1:26:50] <$Dakuu75> sexist
[1:26:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> all this complaining. remember this is a ds game
[1:26:57] <%tusk102> boys are so stupid
[1:26:58] <%MayShip> @sjay449 understandable
[1:26:59] <Ether101_Prime> Raymond's face is really fucked up.
[1:27:02] <Sartastic> I hope Natalia, Vester and Jessica's bus comes back
[1:27:02] <gade177> It's not a game you dumb bitch.
[1:27:09] <%ElenaManetta> She's so obsessed with "dumb boys" it makes me think she's had crappy boyfriends for years in the past
[1:27:10] <californaya> is there a word for foreshadowing for shit that already happened, considering this is a flashback
[1:27:11] <%ElenaManetta> and she just cant let it go
[1:27:14] <%espanishcanamurciana> this game never gets mentioned again because it was weskers lava fever dream...
[1:27:14] <M4T1A5> big punch

[1:27:46] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> the hunter said "THE FOURTH FLOORS THAT WAY"
[1:27:47] <yourliteraldog> Kremlings
[1:27:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's not sealed
[1:27:48] <%Docblargle> should have gone to the fourth floor
[1:27:49] <+DesertPenguin> This is the way
[1:27:50] <%rytisone> Pat is bad at video games
[1:27:51] <%Keyd00d> this is the way
[1:27:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I killed that guy
[1:27:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's not sealed
[1:27:56] <mattrutland> Guess so
[1:27:56] <Dragovus> the codex astartes does not support this action
[1:27:56] <%Jekado> PUNISHED FOR EXPLORING THE GAME
[1:27:59] <%D3rrtyD4n> unbelievable atpSpiner
[1:28:00] <%Kegeto> ........this game
[1:28:01] <+professormorrigan> nah u can go there
[1:28:05] <%snausages_> Wait I thought this guy was dead
[1:28:06] <%spiritofmojave> this game is whack
[1:28:07] <%saadi90> Bad end
[1:28:09] <%ShichiNoBushi> Now I want to see a hunter styled like Ugandan Knuckles.
[1:28:11] <+DesertPenguin> Just grab some shirt and rip it off
[1:28:12] <%SoFarFetched> USE A GREEN HERB TO HEAL HIM
[1:28:15] <spacechannel4> Rags ftw
[1:28:16] <M4T1A5> not it has to be professional
[1:28:17] <%Docblargle> but shut up tho
[1:28:17] <$Dakuu75> brand-names are better though, that's a fact
[1:28:20] <%miguelrod777> and ruin my design hell no
[1:28:20] <%Sir_stride> that's literally survival 101
[1:28:20] <%sniffy77> they need not-umbrella brand torniquets
[1:28:21] <%xxshadowxx416> she has a shirt
[1:28:21] <%Mister_McDerp> no that would ruin their clothes
[1:28:23] <yourliteraldog> Or use the arm band
[1:28:23] <%krawtch> applying a tourniquet basically guarantees the limb is lost also
[1:28:24] <%worldbrand> Great Value brand tourniquet
[1:28:26] <Sapphire_Breeze> @PatStaresAt but Pat, that means creating a new model with ripped clothes
[1:28:26] <Darren716> Bitch you know how much Jessica paid for that?
[1:28:28] <+DesertPenguin> The herbs are magic though
[1:28:30] <mattrutland> No, their unifroms come out of their wages PAT!
[1:28:30] <%marvel877> You can use your hair.
[1:28:30] <theKingRamses> they're all covered in biogoo though
[1:28:31] <Dr_Mooose> but they need brand recognition
[1:28:31] <%Keyd00d> hey that's game stuff
[1:28:33] <%MajorCrasher> yeah just rip up Jessica's skirt. she seems to not need it
[1:28:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they only work on protagonists, Pat, you know this.
[1:28:37] <%trustycoyote> torn shirt, belt, rag... anything really! come'on!
[1:28:38] <+NitronStreams> shhhh you know herbs arent real
[1:28:39] <Shonen_hero> Give him some shit to pack in the wound. Put super glue in it to seal it up
[1:28:41] <DaBigVitus> tourniquet brand deal
[1:28:43] <yourliteraldog> Smoke them herbs
[1:28:44] <%SoFarFetched> Green Herbs are only for Main Characters everyone else can suck it
[1:28:47] <%Sir_stride> yup
[1:28:48] <+DesertPenguin> magick herbs dude
[1:28:49] <Jaysimss> just give him the green top
[1:28:50] <$Hommando> Imagine running around with a gun all day and not having a tourniquet
[1:28:51] <%RowenCleric> re7 takes that to the next level
[1:28:51] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Green Herbs are LITERALLY MAGIC.
[1:28:52] <%ShichiNoBushi> Aren't those herbs supposed to be local to the Arklay Mountains?
[1:28:53] <silverira> EAT GRASS
[1:28:54] <Shonen_hero> Green Herbs are magic fucking potions
[1:28:54] <King_Kth> Yeah but Tournie brand Tourniquets trap 10% more blood more than other competing brands.
[1:28:54] <%Keyd00d> Yeah that's kinda weird
[1:28:54] <%Maids4lyfe> that was the mold
[1:28:54] <+griffball13> re7 lets you seal severd leg
[1:28:55] <+dante_must_die_exe> mostly 7 and the green herb juice
[1:28:55] <spacechannel4> Re7 magic
[1:28:56] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah its great
[1:28:57] <faithless_zealot> Yeah, but only when combined with chemicals
[1:28:57] <$Dakuu75> gloop-juice
[1:28:58] <Dr_Mooose> them dank erbs
[1:28:59] <%tusk102> re7 literally is like "this shits fucking bullshit what the hell?"
[1:28:59] <StingtheKing> Nono, that's PLANT GROWTH JUICE.
[1:28:59] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> green herbs are only compatible with plot armor
[1:28:59] <+Parrish_broadnax> its stupid good
[1:29:00] <%valkuma> Thats RE7 and it doesnt count
[1:29:01] <%the_vedo_show> atpSuspect atpSuspect atpSuspect yessir
[1:29:02] <%YakumoYomi> No weeds for bit players
[1:29:03] <%krawtch> that might only have been because Ethan was infected by mold shit
[1:29:04] <%ElenaManetta> I love the chopped leg moment
[1:29:04] <%tank7013> That also had to do with the virus though didn't it?
[1:29:05] <%snausages_> That is because of THE GIFT
[1:29:05] <%BalloniWright> say word? atpSuspect
[1:29:05] <%ittla> nailed it
[1:29:06] <Mexrage> this is the RE world, i am sure medical science advanced so much by proxy from all the BOW development @PatStaresAt
[1:29:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea RE7 and RE2R literally establish that
[1:29:07] <%Ner234> LUL
[1:29:08] <Timurine> LUL
[1:29:09] <%isolex_> Nailed it
[1:29:09] <%Agami23> green herbs are straight up regenerative
[1:29:10] <%rytisone> in RE6 green herb heals Helena
[1:29:13] <%tusk102> THAT PUNCH IS SO SHITTY LOOKING @PatStaresAt
[1:29:14] <+koraialstrasz> got him!
[1:29:22] <%Keyd00d> Oh yeah wasn't ethan molded up
[1:29:25] <%Sneakman98> Green Herbs are thought to contain a particular strain of the T-Virus that doesn't make you a zombie
[1:29:26] <%espanishcanamurciana> DANGER
[1:29:28] <%nmaten> that enemy looks like rash in killer instinct
[1:29:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> RE7's bullshit was also because Ethan was infected with mold tho
[1:29:28] <DaBigVitus> was that a freaking lariat?
[1:29:30] <%espanishcanamurciana> PELIGRO
[1:29:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what?
[1:29:34] <s1rcuit> have green herbs ever been used or mentioned in cut scenes?
[1:29:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> That was totally the MOLD
[1:29:37] <%Archer2150> Archer2150 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:29:37] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> holy shit pat, the RE7 protag is infected with the MOLD,
[1:29:39] <Drusain> yes
[1:29:41] <DarknessD42> I thought Pat was going to suffer for us in RE6, I guess we‚Äôre getting it early
[1:29:41] <%ForlornCarton> yes
[1:29:42] <%Docblargle> yes
[1:29:42] <%Jekado> couldn't they just use jessica's clothes it doesn't seem like she likes wearing legs
[1:29:42] <%the_vedo_show> yes
[1:29:43] <+berserkscarlett> I really don't remember this game being so "meh" story wise
[1:29:43] <%tusk102> guys ethan wasn't infected
[1:29:43] <Shonen_hero> don't ask questions just consume product
[1:29:44] <%Sir_stride> yes
[1:29:44] <+IShadowStrykerI> only cause ethan was molded tho
[1:29:44] <yourliteraldog> Green Herbs are made of Stem Cells
[1:29:48] <%Meekest> Thats dishonorable
[1:29:50] <%Kegeto> yup
[1:29:52] <42nfl19> NO MAN LEFT BEHIND CLICHE
[1:29:53] <%marvel877> Magic green herbs that should be a rare commodity given they were only found in the Arklay Mountains and that whole area was bombed with Raccoon City.
[1:29:54] <%ElenaManetta> Well you dont KNOW there are more hunters
[1:29:54] <%Mister_McDerp> nah you got herbs tho
[1:29:54] <Reckless_Rob> Probably
[1:29:57] <+Parrish_broadnax> gotta spend money to make money pat
[1:29:58] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt just play the video game
[1:30:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, he was seeing hallucinations
[1:30:00] <%Meekest> Ethan was SUPER infected
[1:30:03] <%krawtch> theres no point in the campaign where Ethan is obviously infected so its most likely to have happened right after "welcome to the family, son"
[1:30:06] <+griffball13> thats why he can see the girl
[1:30:07] <%tusk102> then why didn't he need a cure? @PatStaresAt
[1:30:08] <%vectorless_peon> Fan theory is that Ethan was in early stages of being molded so his regeneration due to herbs is atypical
[1:30:08] <+DesertPenguin> Was he infected from the beginning?
[1:30:09] <%Keyd00d> Yeah that's why he can snap his body back on
[1:30:12] <Reckless_Rob> I dont remember much of that game
[1:30:14] <Aydarkzero> i liked Ethan
[1:30:14] <Ether101_Prime> That's why he can see the little girl.
[1:30:14] <%worldbrand> yeah that's why he can heal right?
[1:30:18] <Pwgregory> But you‚Äôre heading to the hospital. Best place to be sick.
[1:30:19] <%ShichiNoBushi> I thought Umbrella became a successful medical company because of the herbs. That's why they were set up outside Racoon City.
[1:30:20] <Shonen_hero> that's why Ethan is able to see the mushroom ghost
[1:30:23] <Shonen_hero> he's infected
[1:30:26] <OldOnyx> a lot of the stuff that was even remotely grounded in the series has been flanderized in to straight up magic
[1:30:27] <%rytyoung> As soon as he enters the bayou he's infected
[1:30:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @krawtch Yea there is. WHEN HES LOSING HIS FUCKING ARM AND GETS IT BACK
[1:30:29] <%Maids4lyfe> ethan is probably immune or assimilated the mold
[1:30:30] <%croxeye> when he got knocked out he got infected
[1:30:31] <%Keyd00d> kinda moldy
[1:30:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> he was Wolverine
[1:30:33] <BurdRightsActivist> Ethan isn't infected, he put a lot of green juice on that arm stub. He's fine!
[1:30:35] <StingtheKing> @tusk102 He did.
[1:30:35] <%Sir_stride> makes sense
[1:30:38] <%Mister_McDerp> the mold is good, but only a little mold
[1:30:39] <%TDotGoat> why do the monsters have the same jump-back-up animation as the people
[1:30:40] <%Sir_stride> kinda
[1:30:41] <M4T1A5> I actually always thought that's how it worked
[1:30:42] <StarlitStunner> Fungal magic
[1:30:45] <%Ilpala> hey it's all da ammo
[1:30:46] <%Keyd00d> Ethan can have a little mold
[1:30:47] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Ethan was a MOLDY BOY and he got the BIG JUICE.
[1:30:49] <%dalishprince> he loses an arm and gets it back omg
[1:30:50] <%Keyd00d> as a treat
[1:30:50] <+DesertPenguin> @PatStaresAt From a purely gameplay perspective, is RE7 a good game?
[1:30:51] <%tusk102> @StingtheKing when?
[1:30:51] <%krawtch> @XeroSigmaPrime you mean the exact point i said
[1:30:52] <%xxshadowxx416> this office
[1:30:52] <Aydarkzero> i mean it explains why they were able to staple is hand back on him
[1:30:52] <Ether101_Prime> Ammo.
[1:30:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> WHOA a Rev2 Tourniquet!
[1:30:53] <%worldbrand> we need more protagonists that are a little moldy
[1:30:53] <+griffball13> pat ammo
[1:30:54] <%espanishcanamurciana> Ethan can have a little mold, as a treat
[1:30:54] <%Sir_stride> ammo
[1:30:55] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt no, go get the name brand one.
[1:30:55] <%rytyoung> the first instance of seeing Evelyn is an illusion, and therefore Ethan is infecred
[1:30:55] <Shonen_hero> good enough
[1:30:55] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Everyone in re7 needs a huge bath
[1:30:56] <mattrutland> I thought that was super clear from the game? Is it not clear Ethan was infected?
[1:30:57] <%marvel877> ...A tampon?
[1:30:58] <%isolex_> WHY NOT TAKE THE GIANT FIRST AID BAG
[1:30:59] <%miguelrod777> shut up
[1:31:02] <$Dakuu75> man, that's super dumb lol
[1:31:03] <Reckless_Rob> Yeah, just what we needed though
[1:31:03] <%SoFarFetched> Yeah shoot him
[1:31:04] <%Sir_stride> ye
[1:31:05] <%croxeye> he got curedish when his ex did the whole ship sequence
[1:31:05] <%SoFarFetched> take him out
[1:31:06] <Aydarkzero> like Jessica would rip her clothes Kappa
[1:31:06] <%rytisone> rip Jessica's skirt a little
[1:31:06] <earthgolem115> leave the first aid kit though
[1:31:06] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:31:07] <Ether101_Prime> Machine gun ammo on the ground.
[1:31:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> No, they need a Rev2 brand tourniquet, Pat.
[1:31:09] <Shonen_hero> Yeah he would have probably bled out at this point like jesus
[1:31:11] <%marvel877> a cloth and a rope's a tampon.
[1:31:13] <pixelkenj> have you ever gone to doctor school pat
[1:31:13] <%AdmiralButtloaf> only the infected have Evelyn in their minds
[1:31:16] <%Kegeto> This game hurts my brain
[1:31:18] <%Sir_stride> we got eyes everywhere pat
[1:31:19] <%king_wragles> but that tourniquet is made with non-GMO cloth
[1:31:21] <%Maids4lyfe> I hate how the bodies are dissolving
[1:31:22] <%TDotGoat> take a chair to wheel him around
[1:31:23] <%MajorCrasher> Ethan was infected, but I'm pretty sure herbs work on normal people too
[1:31:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @krawtch Oh sorry, I only saw the point you said it wasnt obvious when he got infected
[1:31:30] <+professormorrigan> But he was so safe!
[1:31:31] <%Mister_McDerp> nah hes good
[1:31:34] <s1rcuit> there's a company online that makes good ass tourniquets and various trauma kits
[1:31:38] <%DracaenaLeaf> it really isn't lmao
[1:31:41] <%Sir_stride> oh so that hallway wasnt safe after all?
[1:31:41] <%Keyd00d> that looked good
[1:31:44] <+Parrish_broadnax> why can you just do that
[1:31:45] <Drusain> that punch didn't even hit him
[1:31:46] <Dragovus> The first aid bag has too many medical supplies, it would only slow us down
[1:31:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @krawtch <3
[1:31:50] <%ElenaManetta> How DARE THAT ROOKIE ASSIGN HIMSELF to our mission
[1:31:51] <Aydarkzero> ugh saving people in a crisis is so dumb Kappa
[1:31:56] <%RowenCleric> would this scene instantly be better if Parker was just replaced by Barry instead
[1:31:57] <%krawtch> tourniquets are to save a life at the cost of the limb
[1:31:58] <%espanishcanamurciana> lol
[1:31:59] <black_pariah> that is straight up a dead or alive animation
[1:32:00] <%SoFarFetched> Man that would be hilarious if Jessica only turned evil because she got real tired of parker's nonsense LUL
[1:32:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> kills living things
[1:32:06] <%tusk102> "how dare we have new members"
[1:32:11] <Shonen_hero> The fat protected Parker from the point blank explosion
[1:32:17] <%marvel877> We could have just cauterized the wound with the heat from your guns like in that Vampires movie starring James Woods.
[1:32:17] <VirtuaRailith> I thought this game was over after you blew up the worm whale?
[1:32:19] <%vectorless_peon> hed be dead or unconcious from bloodloss yeah
[1:32:19] <%ElenaManetta> it's surrounded from the forward position
[1:32:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> god, I hate this.
[1:32:21] <+Fynale> idk how hunters can be a major threat when they go down to small arms fire
[1:32:24] <%the_vedo_show> ELBOW
[1:32:27] <%Keyd00d> He just geass'd him
[1:32:28] <BurdRightsActivist> I ORDER YOU TO NOT-DIE
[1:32:29] <%Mister_McDerp> I order you to live LUL
[1:32:31] <+NitronStreams> they opened the door behind him somehow
[1:32:32] <%happyface699> How can this be
[1:32:32] <+dante_must_die_exe> "He will be safe here." "I"M SURROUNDED!"
[1:32:33] <Ether101_Prime> Wouldn't hand guns be mandatory in RE world?
[1:32:39] <Shonen_hero> Man Hunters in this are a fucking joke.
[1:32:40] <zayasu> holy shit this section is still going? or did he restart
[1:32:42] <Shonen_hero> It makes me sad
[1:32:44] <%MajorCrasher> idk why there's so much tension here. we know Raymond survived
[1:32:46] <+Clik404> SUZAKU
[1:32:46] <Kill_Your_CoWorkers> Did it have to be EXCLUSIVELY hunters?
[1:32:50] <%Keyd00d> SO MANY
[1:32:51] <%marvel877> It is not satisfying killing these Hunters.
[1:32:55] <rcand9> hunters suck after 3
[1:32:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @zayasu this section just kinda drags is all.
[1:32:58] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[1:32:58] <%tank7013> LUL
[1:32:58] <%the_vedo_show> were they playing leap frog
[1:33:02] <karl_rex> Why are there no zombies in this game?
[1:33:06] <Jaysimss> i order you to commit not die
[1:33:08] <+trekkie11041> did pat fight the whale yet?
[1:33:08] <+DesertPenguin> They were just there for you
[1:33:10] <yourliteraldog> Rember that gunfu scene in the RE Movie
[1:33:10] <Shonen_hero> LUL
[1:33:13] <Kemmybelle> this would have more tension if we didn't know everyone lives.
[1:33:16] <%krawtch> wasnt it cool when RE took hunters from being badass enemies to total jobbers
[1:33:17] <+Parrish_broadnax> "he'll be safe here." he couldnt have been more ANTI safe
[1:33:19] <%Mister_McDerp> you'd think a bioweapon would be resistant to human punches and pistol rounds

[1:36:57] <%espanishcanamurciana> I hate you raymond
[1:36:58] <yourliteraldog> It was a ds game

[1:37:00] <%krawtch> shut UP
[1:37:01] <%croxeye> he's got that stank face lmao
[1:37:01] <%valkuma> i really want Parker to die because of how awful his haircut is
[1:37:02] <%Aracon_> because
[1:37:03] <%consistentlylistless> Tiny hat love
[1:37:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz he's consistent.
[1:37:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ramand is old school
[1:37:06] <M4T1A5> Maybe he liks thos clothes
[1:37:07] <%Jekado> cuz he's a rookie?
[1:37:07] <Pwgregory> Leave Ginger Matt Smith alone.
[1:37:09] <Dr_Mooose> Pat stop asking questions
[1:37:11] <Ether101_Prime> Isn't he wearing different cloths?
[1:37:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and continued to work for the FBC, supposedly.
[1:37:13] <$Dakuu75> WTF is wrong WITH HIS FACE. looks like a SSJ3 face
[1:37:13] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> cuz females need to be stylish
[1:37:16] <pixelkenj> Vast, huh
[1:37:16] <%jillvxlentine> maybe he likes his hair
[1:37:18] <+Kriptin> Raymond found an outfit he likes
[1:37:20] <+DesertPenguin> THAT FACE
[1:37:21] <rosemon5001> you dont change perfection
[1:37:21] <+DesertPenguin> so good
[1:37:21] <%YakumoYomi> Cuz Raymond's a bitch
[1:37:22] <%rytisone> he likes default clothes
[1:37:22] <%MajorCrasher> because no one cares about Raymond enough to develop a second model
[1:37:22] <+DesertPenguin> no eyes
[1:37:23] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt because he stayed with the FBC
[1:37:24] <%tusk102> @Jekado he meant why is raymond the exact same in the future

[1:37:46] <%BalloniWright> psaBig
[1:37:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat
[1:37:48] <Ether101_Prime> Jessica's supposed to be an evil Jill, right?
[1:37:49] <gade177> But investigating would keep it from happening again....
[1:37:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ammo
[1:37:51] <%D3rrtyD4n> conan: become giant
[1:37:52] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd1 atpRtsd2
[1:37:53] <Slimeking_Mike> NYEHHHHHHHHHHH
[1:37:53] <Dragovus> He's wincing because of the pain, Pat
[1:37:54] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt he is in intense pain
[1:37:54] <%bigboy3d> He makes those elder scroll faces
[1:37:57] <Pwgregory> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to investigate.‚Äù What an absolutely moronic sentiment.
[1:37:58] <%nmaten> you did just fuck up his leg tho
[1:37:58] <%Jekado> @tusk102 maybe he's still a rookie in the future? psaSmug
[1:38:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> eh, nevermind, you'll be fine
[1:38:03] <shockmaster3> man conan o brian has seen better days
[1:38:04] <Shonen_hero> Do you think this game should be on the Stadia?
[1:38:04] <%jillvxlentine> jillvxlentine subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! also hello
[1:38:05] <%ShichiNoBushi> He just smells something that really stinks.
[1:38:06] <%Aracon_> why isn't this game over
[1:38:10] <%Mister_McDerp> got save time and money
[1:38:10] <%Aracon_> why are we here right now
[1:38:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it is
[1:38:12] <Sapphire_Breeze> A MILLION HUNTERS
[1:38:15] <%espanishcanamurciana> remember survival horror guys?
[1:38:15] <WhatzePh> Why is he so salty?
[1:38:15] <MucousMembrain> Hello friends
[1:38:17] <yourliteraldog> I h8 this
[1:38:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt he's wincing in pain
[1:38:20] <+WarbossMetal> As was everything RE at that time
[1:38:21] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> keep moving pat
[1:38:26] <spacechannel4> 3ds game
[1:38:28] <DashXero> I stepped away for a second. Why are we back here?
[1:38:28] <%ChaosAethr> worst than CVX?
[1:38:29] <+professormorrigan> non-jill segments are all garbage
[1:38:30] <%snausages_> that was a pretty cool flip by the hunter
[1:38:30] <Timurine> Is he upset?
[1:38:31] <spacechannel4> LUL LUL
[1:38:32] <Slimeking_Mike> Dire-ass level economy
[1:38:34] <+Parrish_broadnax> Why can you just Hit a Hunter
[1:38:34] <+DiabloDeAzul> At least it's better than gaiden
[1:38:35] <californaya> all these hunters doing Shooting Star Presses
[1:38:36] <%espanishcanamurciana> Pat where's elmo? I want his opinion on this
[1:38:37] <%marvel877> This IS trash... and you still have to play 6 after this!
[1:38:37] <%the_vedo_show> goodluck with the RE6 playthru atpCap
[1:38:38] <%Sir_stride> and after this is re6!
[1:38:40] <M4T1A5> the flip they do when they go the punch position is so stupid though
[1:38:42] <qo_op> i shoot gun
[1:38:43] <Shonen_hero> they just evaprated
[1:38:48] <%SoFarFetched> dizzying
[1:38:48] <%happyface699> Oh look more hunters
[1:38:51] <Ether101_Prime> I wonder if the original teaser for this game actually had a story and if so what it would have been about.
[1:38:52] <ha2ken> !uptime
[1:38:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 38m.
[1:38:54] <%Razputin217> DELETED
[1:38:56] <%ElenaManetta> I dont like this music
[1:38:56] <Shwepie> Just wind up that arm and punch a Hunter in the face.
[1:38:57] <%krawtch> the end of this game is like a trash plate sampler before the feast of RE6
[1:38:59] <trianglehat> CVA is bad and long but was it this LAZY?
[1:38:59] <%rytisone> Who's Pat?
[1:39:01] <santafer> hai hai pat desu
[1:39:06] <Shwepie> Perfect survival horror.
[1:39:08] <%espanishcanamurciana> hey the gun store standoff is kinda cool in leon's campaign in 6
[1:39:11] <Shonen_hero> It's only been an hour and a half? Jesus it feels longer
[1:39:12] <+blasterprime> why are the hunters so ripped?
[1:39:13] <doster504> Did Pat say if he is doing coop with Paige like RE5?
[1:39:13] <Jolnir> re6 is going to be sooooo good
[1:39:13] <%snausages_> When this came out everyone was like 'this is so good it's like a classic RE'. Where this that ever come from?
[1:39:16] <%Meekest> No
[1:39:17] <Buzzard42> no
[1:39:17] <yourliteraldog> Conan looks like he breathing in the most heinous of farts continuously.
[1:39:17] <%Aracon_> no
[1:39:18] <+griffball13> no
[1:39:18] <+Parrish_broadnax> No
[1:39:19] <%isolex_> no
[1:39:20] <%Mister_McDerp> nope
[1:39:20] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt no
[1:39:21] <%Sir_stride> no
[1:39:21] <%ittla> how did someone look at this entire sequence and think "yeah this is acceptable game design"
[1:39:21] <Darren716> Nope
[1:39:21] <+Parrish_broadnax> Not at all
[1:39:21] <santafer> no
[1:39:22] <%worldbrand> of course not
[1:39:23] <%xxshadowxx416> no
[1:39:23] <%MajorCrasher> no
[1:39:23] <%Valdorick> None
[1:39:23] <yourliteraldog> no
[1:39:24] <Aydarkzero> no
[1:39:24] <%Docblargle> no
[1:39:24] <%DarkestDawn64> No
[1:39:24] <Ether101_Prime> They got to blow it up.,
[1:39:25] <%Aracon_> literally not a single part
[1:39:25] <$Literal___Nobody> No
[1:39:26] <%shurtal> SPace laser?
[1:39:26] <+Kriptin> no
[1:39:26] <s1rcuit> NO
[1:39:26] <+trekkie11041> nope
[1:39:26] <%krawtch> Terragrigia only exists to die
[1:39:26] <BurdRightsActivist> Yes :)
[1:39:27] <pixelkenj> it had no impact on the economy
[1:39:27] <ranarath> nope
[1:39:28] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> the final chapter is pretty cool, it has some redemption value
[1:39:28] <%Cn_alpha_02> No
[1:39:28] <%miguelrod777> none
[1:39:29] <Darren716> This could have been in New York
[1:39:29] <tigerfang86> NO
[1:39:30] <+Parrish_broadnax> No One Actually cared
[1:39:30] <%tank7013> The part where hunters aren't roaming America?
[1:39:30] <M4T1A5> no
[1:39:31] <%the_vedo_show> no
[1:39:31] <+berserkscarlett> NOPE
[1:39:31] <santafer> a floating mansion
[1:39:32] <yourliteraldog> The space laser?
[1:39:32] <%ForlornCarton> Evil water virus, so water city
[1:39:32] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt The Space Laser
[1:39:33] <%BalloniWright> more questions huh psaSmug
[1:39:34] <%Meekest> It could've literally been Raccoon City
[1:39:34] <MucousMembrain> Hello friends
[1:39:34] <Marpolo13> because NO
[1:39:35] <startstoprepeat> terragrigia is a single office
[1:39:35] <%rytisone> you can't sink it
[1:39:36] <alexandrecau> yes
[1:39:36] <Ether101_Prime> They couldn't blow up real cities.
[1:39:36] <Vikken141> The OCHEAN i guess
[1:39:37] <+blasterprime> would have been cool to have seen it
[1:39:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz Japan?
[1:39:38] <Viaquez> but magic is cooler
[1:39:38] <%baronblank> not as far as I can tell
[1:39:38] <%sniffy77> hell, make it just a town even
[1:39:39] <%gespenst25> Quebec
[1:39:39] <%Sir_stride> all citys are man made pat
[1:39:39] <%happyface699> @patstaresat prepare because the last boss fight of this game is terrible
[1:39:39] <%cureneckbeard> because boats
[1:39:39] <Pwgregory> Yes they tell you in Revelations 2...
[1:39:40] <%Keyd00d> that's not COOL enough
[1:39:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Solar powered laser and isolation
[1:39:41] <%Kegeto> probaly
[1:39:42] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt i feel like most stories in resident evil don't matter
[1:39:42] <%jillvxlentine> i mean they kill all the bows with its solar power
[1:39:43] <+professormorrigan> BUT AQUAPOLIS THO
[1:39:44] <%juxtest> Trash Panda City
[1:39:45] <VirtuaRailith> I always thought this game was just on a cruise ship lab
[1:39:45] <qo_op> less ppl?
[1:39:47] <+WarbossMetal> Regular cities cant sink into the ocean and never be mentioned again
[1:39:47] <%MajorCrasher> the reason is so that it's forgettable for the main canon
[1:39:50] <+koraialstrasz> atlantis ref?
[1:39:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, I'mma say cuz Japan.
[1:39:50] <alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt FRONT MISSION WAS COOL - re devs
[1:39:51] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt QUIT MAKING SENSE
[1:39:52] <BurdRightsActivist> @professormorrigan AQUAPOLIS ZONE
[1:39:53] <+Tornix> but man-made islands tho Kappa
[1:39:53] <%vectorless_peon> no
[1:39:53] <%dustingunn> it's WATER THEMED, Pat
[1:39:53] <%sniffy77> Have some random fishing town get fucked up. nothing changes
[1:39:54] <Ether101_Prime> Well the cruise ships couldn't have happened.
[1:39:55] <Joestar1890> Because TRAGEDY
[1:39:55] <$Dakuu75> Pat-of-Gripes, over here
[1:39:55] <%Mister_McDerp> they had to make it more like anime
[1:39:57] <%baronblank> wait how was the giant worm thijng NOT the final boss?
[1:39:58] <%ShichiNoBushi> It's so they could invent a city and immediatly destroy it without impacting anything.
[1:39:59] <%ZComiX> BUT SOLAR LAZER PAT
[1:40:00] <KingVeeo> easier to remove from the story probably
[1:40:03] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> it needed to be a disposable city so it wouldnt interupt main game cannon
[1:40:03] <alexandrecau> to not be too real life terrorism
[1:40:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that and maybe they DID want a modern day Atlantis.
[1:40:07] <rcand9> casually walk past hunters
[1:40:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Oh dear, I've missed some slorb action
[1:40:09] <BigManLugan> JUST WALKED PAST THE HUNTERS
[1:40:11] <%Owkono> they thought the name was cool and worked backwards
[1:40:11] <%worldbrand> there was secretly also a duplicate, identical city
[1:40:12] <Shonen_hero> Listen the people at SG1 need a place to base their missions in
[1:40:15] <%marvel877> Couldn't we have had a game where you're trying to get out of Terrgregicia a la RE3?
[1:40:16] <%heartlesshealer> psaWrong
[1:40:18] <%krawtch> Terra Grigia in Italian translates to "land" and "gray"
[1:40:18] <%espanishcanamurciana> Remember the anchor / boat themed keys? What if the game was in the playboy mansion? Oh we need the boobs key, the ass key...the soul key
[1:40:20] <pixelkenj> probably the sun laser beam would be harder to do on mainland
[1:40:21] <%vectorless_peon> you kownow there was no reason other than raising stakes
[1:40:28] <$Literal___Nobody> Terargrigia being a self contained island keeps them from having to explain why the virus didn't spread
[1:40:32] <+DesertPenguin> You never actually go through a door
[1:40:39] <Shonen_hero> there it is
[1:40:40] <%baronblank> what was the purpose of that level
[1:40:40] <+griffball13> Wesker
[1:40:42] <%Keyd00d> MISTER PRESIDENT
[1:40:42] <%DracaenaLeaf> EEeeeeeeeviiiiiiiiiillll

[1:40:55] <%tusk102> A THIRD BOAT

[1:58:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but after he dies, we can give him some pointers. I wanna watch him fail first

[2:11:39] <Captain_Joe1911> Go Pat! BloodTrail
[2:11:39] <Fro5tburn> Chris is 4Head
[2:11:40] <spacechannel4> Yeah pat 1st
[2:11:40] <%BionoidLCR> pat what are you aiming for?
[2:11:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pirate tyrant
[2:11:43] <RadShiro> AIM BOIVIN AIM
[2:11:44] <+Qsmash_> nice aim
[2:11:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pyrant
[2:11:47] <%sjay449> THEY ALL DO THIS
[2:11:48] <Manjove> this is an actually cool design though
[2:11:48] <+Kairi__> STANDO POWAAA
[2:11:50] <%Dementedpenguin> I want to believe
[2:11:50] <+trekkie11041> @Docblargle this is before re5
[2:11:50] <yourliteraldog> YEAH THAT MAKES MORE SENSE
[2:11:50] <%croxeye> AMMO
[2:11:52] <Coystick> Pyrant
[2:11:52] <+NitronStreams> WHY CAN FISHMAN USE SHADOW CLONES
[2:11:54] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> SoSerious
[2:11:56] <ALTRNico> shoot the chandelier?
[2:11:57] <%CalderGaming> actually okay this is before RE5 so... HAS he seen anyone infect themselves before?
[2:11:57] <Louie_Salmon> This is the most nonsense I have seen RE get
[2:11:59] <Aydarkzero> Chris tripleTISM
[2:11:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nice strat, try aiming instead
[2:12:06] <%krawtch> time to get good
[2:12:06] <captnbellybutton> paige could do a better job
[2:12:09] <Zombrocom> Maybe try dodging
[2:12:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> charged shot might hurt instead of help here
[2:12:11] <+prime_name> Teleporting behind you
[2:12:13] <CappuccinoGuil> The part I hate about this is how his arm gets in the way of aiming, so if he spawns to your right, you're fucked
[2:12:13] <Coystick> Does him teleporting prove that Wesker was magical?
[2:12:15] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Poor Jill
[2:12:17] <saiyan24675> This can‚Äôt be Chris Redfield this is a Chris Robot and the actual Chris is still bulking up for RE5
[2:12:20] <%miguelrod777> this theme is cool thi
[2:12:21] <cheezbass> is this rly the whole fight?
[2:12:22] <%Aracon_> so this guy sits under water for an entire year and gains the power of a zombie god somehow
[2:12:24] <+dante_must_die_exe> Ye ye ye Chris do big good job
[2:12:26] <%xUmbraNinja> Dodge like Bayo
[2:12:28] <Captain_Joe1911> Get em' Pat! >(
[2:12:28] <mattrutland> Do you have to shoot the heart and then the thing on its back?
[2:12:29] <natebud> dodging is ideal
[2:12:32] <Zombrocom> Well that sucks
[2:12:32] <+Qsmash_> mix ups
[2:12:37] <ALTRNico> get good tho
[2:12:38] <%SoFarFetched> Green herb next to chris
[2:12:38] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> It's is tho just get good
[2:12:38] <+WarbossMetal> Jill's dodge is 'unreliable' you say? hm
[2:12:40] <natebud> it is very reliable
[2:12:43] <Deadbulky> Back is also a weakpoint
[2:12:43] <%the_vedo_show> that tracking
[2:12:44] <alexandrecau> his will of revenge make him too strong
[2:12:46] <%heartlesshealer> if there's a front and back, it's always the back
[2:12:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[2:12:48] <Captain_Joe1911> :O
[2:12:50] <+Justlaxy> scan for healz?
[2:12:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Taking the shot instead of not doing that, is reliable tho
[2:12:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The corner traps and such are kinda bs
[2:12:56] <%wampa661> This fight seems almost entirely reliant on having a partner
[2:12:59] <$Literal___Nobody> Dodging is the best way to beat this boss
[2:12:59] <%Valdorick> F
[2:12:59] <%Mister_McDerp> F
[2:13:00] <AntChodeny> if they wanted magic in RE then they should've gone with the original DMC3 concept
[2:13:01] <gade177> This started out okay then got boring.
[2:13:01] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> PAT BAD AT GAMES SoSerious

[2:13:05] <%SoFarFetched> There was a green herb next to chris.
[2:13:05] <mattrutland> thats what i figured, the back is a bigger weak point
[2:13:06] <+NitronStreams> TAKE 2
[2:13:06] <Heartless_01> lmfao
[2:13:08] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> bodied

[2:13:09] <silverira> MORTIS
[2:13:09] <%Aracon_> chris you could help instead of asking dumb questions
[2:13:13] <pixelkenj> you can scan him for an extra heal
[2:13:14] <ALTRNico> DOOODGE
[2:13:14] <%BionoidLCR> pat its not hard at all

[2:13:28] <+Justlaxy> fitzShrug One shots aren't that cool anyway.
[2:13:29] <%dustingunn> @PatStaresAt use the machine gun until the last phase
[2:13:31] <%InugamiTheHound> pat wasted so much of magnum ammo
[2:13:32] <+Clik404> @bionoidlcr YES IT IS
[2:13:36] <spacechannel4> Dodge is moment of hit but dodge is not reliable
[2:13:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Try pulling the trigger instead of not pulling the trigger
[2:13:37] <Louie_Salmon> Why does his forehead glow before he teleports and makes a false clone?
[2:13:38] <Shonen_hero> honestly this boss is kind of fun
[2:13:38] <%BionoidLCR> @Clik404 LUL

[2:14:44] <$Literal___Nobody> Give him some slack its Pre Re5 Chris
[2:14:46] <Shonen_hero> He's also the strongest ever so it balances out I guess
[2:14:46] <%SoFarFetched> I think for those you HAVE to shoot the front
[2:14:46] <santafer> what is this DMC shit?!
[2:14:47] <BurdRightsActivist> He's DOING HIS BEST. LEAVE HIM ALONE
[2:14:50] <quasiplaying> wait what did he say?
[2:14:51] <%PerrinIsDead> ‚ÄúBRUWBRHWBRUWBRWU‚Äù - Veltro
[2:14:52] <%cowardman93> RE1 and CVX still happened
[2:14:53] <kingbaconcrispy> Yeah but after CVX Chris should know
[2:14:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The AOE is also godawful
[2:14:55] <%dustingunn> move to the right to shoot past his arm
[2:14:59] <mattrutland> It would be cool if you could shoot the chandelier on top of it
[2:15:01] <Shonen_hero> Also he can stand in the cauldera of a volcano and be fine because whatever I guess
[2:15:03] <%happyface699> Dumb but capable
[2:15:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so yeah, if you haven't caught on yet, purple smoke = real. No purple smoke? Not real.
[2:15:10] <nuane> it waS a hologram
[2:15:10] <Pwgregory> How can Chris be a himbo. He literally doesn‚Äôt know what the sex is.
[2:15:11] <%CalderGaming> who infected themselves in front of chris in CVX again?
[2:15:12] <%xUmbraNinja> What a revelation
[2:15:19] <%PerrinIsDead> Oh wow shadow clone jitsu this never happens in boss fights
[2:15:19] <+professormorrigan> Tracking LUL
[2:15:24] <%krawtch> tracking overheads are what we call FUN

[2:15:31] <%Mister_McDerp> hes a souls boss
[2:15:32] <AntChodeny> @santafer at this point they should just crossover DMC and RE
[2:15:32] <+Jonesman64> Ah.. over head swing tracking... excellent
[2:15:33] <vivaldiva> good thing Woolie isn't playing
[2:15:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @xUmbraNinja Revel lay a ton
[2:15:37] <%jillvxlentine> a himbo is someones whos jacked as fuck but also dumb
[2:15:39] <%Tearonex> Wait, the first attack he did this attempt was a turn
[2:15:41] <%heartlesshealer> chimney chest is always the real one
[2:15:41] <OldOnyx> wow, this is bad even for pat
[2:15:44] <kingbaconcrispy> Not in front of him but Wesker was infected, with t ebola
[2:15:47] <%jillvxlentine> you dont need to know what sex is to be a himbo
[2:15:48] <nuane> souls bosses wish they were this hard
[2:15:48] <%dustingunn> this is not a good strat
[2:15:51] <rcand9> WESKER infected himself not once not twice but thrice
[2:15:54] <natebud> It's because he was running around the fake one before, wasn't getting hit
[2:15:54] <%happyface699> You u have 450 holy shit bro that‚Äôs alot
[2:15:54] <M4T1A5> just use shotgun for heart
[2:15:55] <%baronblank> just shoot his heart to stun him
[2:15:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just shoot his heart. It's a more sure thing.
[2:15:59] <%dustingunn> stop trying to cheese it, pat!
[2:16:00] <%Aracon_> oh he has a cmd grab
[2:16:00] <%D3rrtyD4n> the actual design isnt half bad, but this fight....i dunno
[2:16:02] <%YakumoYomi> I believe in you, Stumbo
[2:16:02] <%the_vedo_show> cmd grab LUL
[2:16:02] <+professormorrigan> whoa a grab?
[2:16:03] <%DracaenaLeaf> remember you can always aim at the front if you can't hit the back
[2:16:05] <%PerrinIsDead> Pat drop your shield
[2:16:05] <turth3> Stop Pretending Weirdchamp
[2:16:07] <+trekkie11041> backs not a good idea for this part
[2:16:08] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Resident Evil protags are basically super heroes if you think about it LuL
[2:16:10] <%xUmbraNinja> @doc_ock_rokc true lol
[2:16:13] <%PerrinIsDead> Drop that shield roll roll roll

[2:24:34] <Fro5tburn> they're not here to babysit? DansGame then what am I paying them for
[2:24:37] <%MajorCrasher> this fight is not cool, he takes way too much ammo to kill
[2:24:40] <daemos123> here's a hint chat. just because your favorite streamer isn't good at a game doesn't mean its bad
[2:24:43] <%xUmbraNinja> Best RE obviously
[2:24:44] <Sapphire_Breeze> do the RE spin
[2:24:51] <KaraRedgrave> @PatStaresAt the real ones heart is exposed

[2:24:51] <kingbaconcrispy> @xenoriddley36 He did and promplty deleted it
[2:24:52] <+trekkie11041> YOU DONT DODGE IT YOU STUN HIM
[2:24:53] <Deadbulky> Why no quick turn LUL

[2:25:04] <%radda343> pat you turn faster when you'r not aiming
[2:25:04] <+Clik404> @daemos123 yes, I played this myself and thought it sucked then too
[2:25:06] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, that auto-hit quake is dumb
[2:25:06] <%krawtch> it wouldnt be bad if the range didnt matter
[2:25:09] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie, you have to hit them
[2:25:11] <%Mister_McDerp> if a bossfight sucks just because someone is "playing it wrong" then its still a shitty bossfight
[2:25:13] <+xenoriddley36> @kingbaconcrispy I was wondering. He went on and on about how long it was, but I only see 2 parts on YT
[2:25:15] <%Dementedpenguin> Someone's defending REV 1? LUL
[2:25:17] <Fro5tburn> just win Pat 4Head
[2:25:18] <spacechannel4> Dodge attack, your to far. I assume
[2:25:18] <rcand9> why does he attack slow
[2:25:19] <natebud> you have to be close to dodge
[2:25:22] <+professormorrigan> i fought for the first time recently and thought he was rad
[2:25:22] <+ClothoBuer> Just shoot him 4Head
[2:25:22] <%the_vedo_show> just hit him 4Head
[2:25:23] <%nmaten> pat just hit him and dont get hit it easy
[2:25:24] <%Typhaeon> *incoherent mumbling*
[2:25:27] <vivaldiva> just shoot the biocurse until it dies
[2:25:28] <+Fynale> i think it's a frontal cone he's missed before
[2:25:28] <%xUmbraNinja> Pat‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ drop shield
[2:25:28] <M4T1A5> shothung super best for hitting him
[2:25:29] <spacechannel4> You have dodge slambefore
[2:25:33] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Nothing human remains

[2:25:49] <kingbaconcrispy> @xenoriddley36 He didi it all and shortly played the attack mode thingy
[2:25:51] <spacechannel4> Raid a challenge
[2:25:52] <M4T1A5> quick turn though
[2:25:53] <+Parrish_broadnax> nothing Human remains btw :)

[2:26:02] <Hellarussian> N-NANI
[2:26:04] <%CJett92> This seems like a really fun and not at all repetetive boss fight
[2:26:04] <42nfl19> so what aquatic creature has ILLUSION POERS
[2:26:04] <%Estuko> monkaS
[2:26:07] <%isolex_> Hey Chris, maybe if you infect yourself, leon will sleep with your sister to console her from the loss
[2:26:12] <+xenoriddley36> @kingbaconcrispy thanks for the update!
[2:26:14] <Deadbulky> LUL
[2:26:14] <Heartless_01> lol
[2:26:17] <+BurkeBigsby> Is there no quick turn?
[2:26:20] <OldOnyx> would pat even make anymore money doing stuff for polygon?
[2:26:30] <Deadbulky> There is quick turn
[2:26:31] <natebud> there is a quickturn
[2:26:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> @BurkeBigsby not for Pat it seems
[2:26:35] <%heartlesshealer> no
[2:26:35] <%D3rrtyD4n> no
[2:26:35] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt At this point in the series how many people has Chris seen infect themselves?
[2:26:35] <+Parrish_broadnax> he would make Anti Money
[2:26:36] <%Aracon_> no
[2:26:37] <ALTRNico> phase 3 is the consecutive shit
[2:26:37] <+trekkie11041> nope
[2:26:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nope
[2:26:37] <%Sir_stride> no
[2:26:37] <%Docblargle> no
[2:26:37] <%Mister_McDerp> nah

[2:26:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, he sucks in this
[2:26:40] <%heartlesshealer> He's there for flavor
[2:26:40] <Sapphire_Breeze> no
[2:26:40] <xhawkeyeninja> no
[2:26:41] <%SoFarFetched> @BurkeBigsby there is but pat is forgetting to use it LUL
[2:26:41] <Shonen_hero> no
[2:26:41] <+xenoriddley36> LUL
[2:26:41] <%tank7013> Not really, no
[2:26:41] <%Nina96> no
[2:26:42] <%Aracon_> he is accomplishing NOTHING
[2:26:42] <+Chewygamer> he's doing his best
[2:26:43] <%Estuko> LUL
[2:26:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Chris does NOT need to be here.
[2:26:44] <%krawtch> if he wasnt here who would tell you to keep your head in the game
[2:26:44] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's moral support.
[2:26:44] <%rytisone> for the story
[2:26:44] <+SolverCODO> pat isnt quick turning so he can charge the gun. its a bad strat tho
[2:26:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> chris adds nothing to this fight
[2:26:45] <%miguelrod777> he adds sound effects
[2:26:45] <+Parrish_broadnax> Is Chris Really here?
[2:26:45] <$Caped_Eggy> He's moral support
[2:26:46] <alexandrecau> moral aupport
[2:26:46] <Shonen_hero> like what is he even doing
[2:26:47] <+WarbossMetal> At the bottom of the ocean? yeah
[2:26:47] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Remember you get to play RE6 after this :)
[2:26:47] <pixelkenj> hes trying
[2:26:47] <Dr_Mooose> moral support
[2:26:47] <Zombrocom> He's providing valuable moral support
[2:26:47] <theKingRamses> no but i think he's gotten some backshots occasionally
[2:26:49] <%TDotGoat> who would ask the important questions?
[2:26:49] <%dalishprince> you need ur himbo sidekick
[2:26:49] <%MajorCrasher> he might as well not be LUL
[2:26:50] <kingbaconcrispy> @xenoriddley36 No problem, now endure this
[2:26:51] <Ether101_Prime> I thought this game had Co-Op.
[2:26:54] <%InugamiTheHound> could he do any damage to the boss?
[2:26:54] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> HE'S DOING HIS BEST
[2:26:55] <Louie_Salmon> He's on commentary
[2:26:56] <%Estuko> It's fucking dumb how unhelpful chris is
[2:26:56] <+Lunarhawk> Chris has never needed to be in any of the games other than cv:x if you really think about it
[2:26:56] <Shonen_hero> Chris is your emotional support partner
[2:26:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you're doing better, tho.
[2:26:58] <%jillvxlentine> chris is there to shoot his back so you can shoot the front
[2:27:01] <%D3rrtyD4n> demoralizing support
[2:27:01] <%MajorCrasher> @ether101_prime nope
[2:27:01] <+badjab326> this game should have been co-op
[2:27:02] <%SoFarFetched> @Ether101_Prime it was Raid mode that did for thos
[2:27:03] <+trekkie11041> @Ether101_Prime only in raid mode
[2:27:03] <Sunstalker> RE6 next vadeAww
[2:27:03] <%heartlesshealer> he's part of the background music
[2:27:03] <OldOnyx> partners are pretty worthless in this, yeah
[2:27:05] <%SoFarFetched> This*
[2:27:05] <+professormorrigan> These are his pre-boulder days :)
[2:27:06] <%Aracon_> I guess moral support is all he's good for
[2:27:06] <xeros720> it does have coop in raid mode
[2:27:07] <Louie_Salmon> Chris is a screamlord on this match
[2:27:07] <ha2ken> He's just there to raise the show ratings...
[2:27:07] <%AquilaHarukaze> He's here for atmospheric gunshot noises
[2:27:08] <Zebroneath> Is he actually doing ANY damage at all?
[2:27:08] <%sjay449> @Ether101_Prime that's REV 2.
[2:27:11] <mattrutland> Chris is not real. he was your ghost friend all along
[2:27:11] <%Kegeto> for fan service
[2:27:11] <%krawtch> he occasionally does damage and staggers him
[2:27:13] <%Estuko> PogChamp pat is beating his Stand!
[2:27:14] <+xenoriddley36> @kingbaconcrispy I actually really like Revalations 1 & 2. I thought they were great spinoffs
[2:27:18] <%supersugoisenpai1> Resident Evil is infamous for shitty writing, but "how can a man be driven to infect himself?" is the dumbest I have heard
[2:27:21] <%Aracon_> jill never stops thinking about him and vice versa
[2:27:22] <%sniffy77> Pat, apparently this boss moves so fast it looks like its teleporting, and also it slows down to attack you with a big ground pound
[2:27:22] <natebud> At least he always shoots the right one
[2:27:23] <%kenji_not_genji> Does Chris even do damage?
[2:27:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He's your Emotional Support Himbo
[2:27:24] <%D3rrtyD4n> @Kegeto thats the correct answer
[2:27:25] <Ether101_Prime> I could have sworn the DS version had Co-Op.
[2:27:26] <Fro5tburn> BAD TOUCH SwiftRage
[2:27:27] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, a touch triggers a swift attack
[2:27:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Phase 3
[2:27:38] <%Mister_McDerp> are we done with this yet?
[2:27:39] <+UnpronounceableName> slapped LUL
[2:27:40] <+DesertPenguin> Just stand there and take that bitch slap
[2:27:43] <alexandrecau> Honesty do ANY OF you need to be here, just says langdal confessed and tried to kill you
[2:27:43] <HyperBomb21> he punched?
[2:27:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Man that dodge is too fuckin unreliable
[2:27:47] <Hellarussian> hasnt every villain so far infected themselves?
[2:27:47] <%D3rrtyD4n> wtf
[2:27:47] <kingbaconcrispy> @xenoriddley36 I think they're okay, I prefer one.
[2:27:49] <%EuropanLamprey> He's the little brother you hand the unplugged controller to
[2:27:52] <OldOnyx> quick, run in a straight line towards the charging boss
[2:27:54] <%Aracon_> I guess
[2:27:55] <%jillvxlentine> changing phases
[2:27:57] <M4T1A5> I think the flash is supposed to basically be a flash bang, se they can't seem the boss move
[2:28:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> He is Blinding and changing positions
[2:28:02] <+Parrish_broadnax> who cares
[2:28:02] <natebud> the dodge is pretty reliable
[2:28:03] <%Jekado> just like wesker
[2:28:05] <%sniffy77> yep he sonics you, and also he cant hit you
[2:28:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> He ran
[2:28:07] <+joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> YOU MIGHT WANT THAT HERB BUDDY
[2:28:09] <Hellarussian> H-HES FAST
[2:28:10] <%Jekado> its like they never fought wesker
[2:28:11] <alexandrecau> he is charging
[2:28:13] <dullvivid> how the heck did he run that's crazy??
[2:28:18] <yeildingthought> Phase 3 PogChamp
[2:28:19] <Zombrocom> This is not how flashbangs work
[2:28:22] <+NitronStreams> How could he have ANOTHER phase
[2:28:29] <%heartlesshealer> It's presented wrong, but it's sensory overload with the flashlight face
[2:28:30] <SheefEatsBeef> he is The Big White Evil
[2:28:32] <+xenoriddley36> I still hope that Revelations 3 happens ones day
[2:28:35] <%krawtch> STOP RELOADING WHEN HE DROPS TO A KNEE
[2:28:38] <mattrutland> I guess saying that is just a phase transition
[2:28:39] <Heartless_01> chris is trying his little heart out BibleThump
[2:28:39] <UndeadManatee> what could drive a man to infect himself?
[2:28:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh wow

[2:28:46] <Sapphire_Breeze> ??
[2:28:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he whiffed hard
[2:28:51] <%krawtch> YOU ARE THROWING DAMAGE IN THE TRASH
[2:28:51] <Ahk_90> he whiffed like a bitch
[2:28:55] <C24U> @Jekado Jill hasn't fought Wesker at this point in time
[2:28:58] <%InugamiTheHound> aiming too hard

[2:41:23] <%Nobrev> FF14 5.2 has some of the best new music the game has ever gotten
[2:41:24] <+berserkscarlett> RE6 is such a drag man
[2:41:26] <%YakumoYomi> I think I'll boot up RE6 myself

[2:41:34] <%tusk102> @berserkscarlett no but its fine tho
[2:41:44] <+DesertPenguin> I just did some wiki stuff and after Umbrella dismantled it came back but they're trying to right their wrongs. That happened in 2007, yet RE5 and RE6 are in 2009 and 2013 and never mention anything
[2:41:48] <LustrousEudemon> reminder that the game he just played because he's playing mainline is no longer mainline in his head so it was all for nothing
[2:41:50] <mattrutland> Man, I never played Rev all the way through before, so that was cool for me to finally see it
[2:41:51] <%tusk102> @Shonen_hero chris i need you to fuck my sister
[2:41:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> someone in this chat has convinced themselves they love RE6 because they bought it at launch.

[2:55:36] <%spiritofmojave> Please don't for the sake of those around you
[2:55:37] <%snausages_> Jump potions are fine for alts
[2:55:41] <%valriot> People are bad enough at the game
[2:55:42] <%genowyn> Do not boost
[2:55:43] <%cowardman93> too late for me!
[2:55:44] <Ciglossonjr> Dont jump first time through you'll stop playing
[2:55:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Sounds like they're gonna streamline the shit out of it, yeah
[2:55:53] <%genowyn> Yeah wait for 5.3
[2:55:59] <%dasmause> jump potion for warrior cause leveling warriors is ass
[2:56:01] <Ciglossonjr> Titan Banquet will still totally be in though
[2:56:09] <%cowardman93> I'm doing Realm Reborn right now!
[2:56:12] <%spiritofmojave> Alts make sense long as you know the class/have money ig
[2:56:17] <%snausages_> Like once you've levelled a tank, healer and different type DPS there's no real prob with jump potion as long as you can read skill descripts and can learn a rotation
[2:56:23] <RyuuAoi> Fun Fact: Pat was born the same day as Hitler. 4/20 The more you know. twitchRaid
[2:56:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> I made the mistake of jump potioning a marauder.
[2:56:35] <Dieworc> jump potion is fine the jobs arnt hard to play unless youre bad at MMO combat in general
[2:56:35] <+Justlaxy> I jump potion my lancer and regret it now cause class quests are gone now.
[2:56:45] <%isolex_> pat is just saying words

[2:56:54] <+DesertPenguin> none of that makes sense
[2:56:57] <%isolex_> pat is literally just saying random words
[2:56:58] <+DesertPenguin> but sure do it all
[2:56:58] <%GarbageNirvana> As someone who hasn't gotten that far into fishing, those sure are words he's saying
[2:57:00] <FutaSnek> Same
[2:57:01] <Shonen_hero> proper nouns everywhere
[2:57:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> THAT'S A LOT OF WORDS
[2:57:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THOSE ARENT WORDS
[2:57:03] <Psyramics> And then you take the tingerbacker, and give i a good wallop. make sure to rub your onion on it, cause its the style right now
[2:57:03] <accusedphoenix> He is speaking the language of Gods

[2:57:25] <%SoFarFetched> HOOKING COOL FISH
[2:57:25] <+DesertPenguin> Why fish?
[2:57:26] <%spiritofmojave> fishing is legit fun
[2:57:28] <Ashecroft> Ive used jump potions on alt jobs because WoW killed any love for leveling for me
[2:57:30] <%snausages_> Fishing (Savage)
[2:57:30] <%genowyn> It's rainbow time baby psaLiz
[2:57:32] <%Nina96> i miss 14...
[2:57:39] <+DesertPenguin> We didn't ask you to explain it
[2:57:40] <bear_breaker20> Y tho
[2:57:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt random words from pat
[2:57:43] <+HelloImTom08> Save double hook for rainbow
[2:57:43] <%Verd_254> i double hook on which one?
[2:57:44] <Ciglossonjr> fishing is the best gathering job
[2:57:44] <RyuuAoi> That's not real @patstaresat you can't double hook.
[2:57:47] <+projectmanatees> what 14 stuff will pat be doing?
[2:57:47] <Darkrenai> Will it make more sense once we do it
[2:57:48] <%KnivesEve> i understand these. all i do in ff14 is fishing

[3:11:19] <%trustycoyote> I can see the gambling feelings firing in your brain lol @PatStaresAt
[3:11:20] <Darkrenai> Ocean fishing gives you tons of exp
[3:11:20] <Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat I started yakuzz 6 and path of exile yoday
[3:11:21] <%Ner234> I thought you were max

[3:11:28] <Ciglossonjr> How fast will this get me from 35 to 80?
[3:11:30] <+2DSuperiority> And Pat says he doesn't understand Animal Crossing
[3:11:31] <NemokillerV> @Ner234 It's for leveling up the fishing class
[3:11:31] <MayorRev> HYPE ASS FISHIN
[3:11:31] <%Lapinelis> Got my shit to 80 before 5.1 hit, I'm mad salty about the changes to exp
[3:11:33] <islandoasis> the stream's content is actually watching the viewer count drop
[3:11:33] <%rdark_ksu> horray gambling
[3:11:38] <%worldbrand> can i get to lv80 fishing while staying a low level in a real class? like, sub 30?
[3:11:41] <@JustinianKnight> fishing is always gambling tho
[3:11:41] <%Shadicara> Big gambling
[3:11:43] <apolitenoob> Is there an "Aetherite Earring" equivalent but for gatherers and crafters?
[3:11:44] <%rytisone> @GarbageNirvana We should thank the Leader for this nice day
[3:11:46] <%Piemen99> hooray fish gambling

[3:11:48] <%DedlokPM> @Ner234 he is not max on every class
[3:11:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Fishing is gambling with nature.
[3:11:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> This mad man really did it
[3:11:56] <islandoasis> mining for fish
[3:12:01] <%isolex_> @PatStaresAt Is the score shared for the party?
[3:12:02] <%Kiiper> I know a guy called River king
[3:12:03] <bestwaifuritsu> crafting and gathering exp is the highest its ever been
[3:12:04] <+Yakobro> @worldbrand you CAN but you'll be locked out of later abilites that need you to go to further zones
[3:12:06] <+Ell1ot> is fishing just Loot Boxes that take forever to open?
[3:12:07] <ethey16> @patstaresat what's the end game?
[3:12:08] <%Kiiper> Only has an 80 fisher
[3:12:09] <+projectmanatees> Also do your GC turn ins they pay out really well
[3:12:11] <%Shadicara> Look at a guide Kappa
[3:12:12] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt isn't fishing in real life already gambling since you throw your bait out and hope for a good fish?
[3:12:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Which is funny because Ocean fishing in real life is FUCKING EASY
[3:12:13] <%worldbrand> that's tempting
[3:12:13] <+Fynale> the only problem is you can't fish high level zones w/o getting those zones
[3:12:19] <%Vanessa_Ui> All I can imagine is all the discarded fish on that dock.
[3:12:20] <%genowyn> You won't be able to get a lot of abilities though
[3:12:23] <CrimsonFox777> 300k a pop, it looks like
[3:12:23] <%worldbrand> that is tempting to just gun it and try
[3:12:26] <Ciglossonjr> Holy shit
[3:12:27] <%genowyn> Many of them come from the class quests
[3:12:32] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> how often do the fishing raids go up? 30 minutes? An hour?
[3:12:34] <%afronooch> I picked up Division 2 since it was 3 bucks. Its cool but not GaaS cool.
[3:12:35] <Shonen_hero> man I love fishing mini games. Star Dew, Persona 4, WoW, Zelda, etc. There's a lot of good fishing to be done
[3:12:39] <%YakumoYomi> The only games where I've sunk a lot of time into fishing were Breath of Fire games.
[3:12:41] <+Yakobro> @ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº 2 hours

[3:13:08] <BoneofMalkav> @Shonen_hero Breath of Fire series has some good fishing too.
[3:13:12] <+Yakobro> pretty sure it does
[3:13:13] <@JustinianKnight> only GP is good
[3:13:14] <+Arnschen> @PatStaresAt Did you get the shark mount or minion yet?
[3:13:15] <+HelloImTom08> Except GP

[3:13:17] <MayorRev> So big fish = big $$$?
[3:13:20] <islandoasis> go back to Rev2
[3:13:20] <+NeonLight> So aside from fishing, what other gatherers are worth looking into?
[3:13:21] <ethey16> @patstaresat what's the end game?
[3:13:23] <MayorRev> or do you eat em
[3:13:28] <islandoasis> or Rev1
[3:13:29] <seaechiowai> no I mean undergeared for pvm for his level

[3:26:33] <%DedlokPM> The phrase ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a game‚Äù is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you‚Äôve lost twice. There‚Äôs always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

[3:51:30] <Monkeyweed21> welcome to babies first finale
[3:51:32] <geneshaft_flcl> i miss being able to skip the cutscenes
[3:51:43] <+xGreenflame> It's the last 2 missions of the base game
[3:51:45] <Lt_Campbell> such important lore
[3:51:47] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah just wait till you meet jesus
[3:51:47] <%heartlesshealer> required and yet also unskippable
[3:51:47] <%spiritofmojave> I remember when the cutscenes weren't mandatory and people jumped/left me behind first time
[3:51:48] <+metalsiren31> 90 ilvls below the ilvl cap at 50
[3:51:48] <@JustinianKnight> that was awful for new players tho
[3:51:48] <%heartlesshealer> damn
[3:51:51] <%cowardman93> damn this might be my next dungeon if it's 50. I'm like level 46
[3:51:54] <FutaSnek> SALAMI

[3:52:16] <RazHarvey> lol lame
[3:52:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> gross
[3:52:20] <%cowardman93> the Caestrum right?
[3:52:22] <Basch71> this shit was like less than 10 minutes long
[3:52:23] <Psyramics> this is the climax of the base game, btw
[3:52:24] <+necrocannibal2> I honestly prefer that, actually
[3:52:26] <%heartlesshealer> they should have just not made it mandatory
[3:52:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 Didn't the President of the US put him together and is also the main villain of the chapter with the universe breaking "spin" ability thing?
[3:52:29] <+necrocannibal2> fuck cutscenes
[3:52:30] <%joeobo2> happened on my first time through
[3:52:33] <%isolex_> yeah, the other castrum
[3:52:35] <%cowardman93> I think I'm building up to Caestrum right now
[3:52:44] <%heartlesshealer> oh
[3:52:47] <super_robo_mg> they should have just made this singleplayer
[3:52:48] <+Fynale> can't skip cutscenes on ocean fishing either
[3:52:49] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger no no johnny and gyro are the spin. the president is the universe hopper.
[3:52:55] <Lt_Campbell> big Chunky rewards
[3:52:57] <%heartlesshealer> yeah that's a lot
[3:52:58] <errasos> thats actually pretty smart
[3:53:05] <%madskull456> my first time doing this as tank i got left behind super fast lol
[3:53:07] <errasos> award them for doing the longer one they hate
[3:53:14] <vVAstrAVv> "solution"
[3:53:16] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger also johnny can't walk
[3:53:22] <+metalsiren31> I've run Castrum with 3 people before and still barely broke a sweat
[3:53:26] <geneshaft_flcl> its so easy that you can do this without healers if the party just knows what to do
[3:53:34] <%cowardman93> it's fine
[3:53:34] <%CJett92> ITS FINE
[3:53:35] <%YakumoYomi> Poetics? Tonestones? Those aren't words!

[3:54:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 Ah okay. Man, I can't wait. I get hype just thinking about that stuff. Doesn't Johnny have a horse that he rides on? I played the old fighting game YEARS ago and remember something like that.

[3:54:41] <BusterWoIf> 50 GET ABOUT 1 AND 1/2 LVL
[3:54:43] <super_robo_mg> but the cutscenes make me crave the release of death

[3:58:58] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger reminder that overwatch turned healing into a kink
[3:59:02] <%Tucker0603> @patstaresat I still have Power Slash on my DRK bar out of spite
[3:59:05] <%Muzzle131> What data center is Pat on?
[3:59:05] <%spiritofmojave> Except if you're summoner now
[3:59:06] <errasos> also mage > vampir
[3:59:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm pretty excited for ti tho.
[3:59:08] <+metalsiren31> What I really want back is Sole Survivor. I feel like it's the only thing missing from DRK's current kit
[3:59:09] <Ravoric> @PatStaresAt is dots why you are moving to a bard?
[3:59:10] <RazHarvey> lol nice
[3:59:12] <super_robo_mg> don't worry guys, pat is almost a quarter of the way through this dungeon
[3:59:12] <DAIROCKETTO> hey look it's char
[3:59:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 Do I want to know?
[3:59:13] <Drusain> MORE DOTS
[3:59:16] <%Ilpala> EVERYONE, THROW MORE DOTS
[3:59:16] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I'm pretty unenthused with all of the things the game will NOT allow you to do
[3:59:19] <Monkeyweed21> But DoTs are the opposite of big number
[3:59:24] <Azathotic> @tusk102 I thought that was a joke when I first saw that in OW. I wanna go back to those innocent days
[3:59:29] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> I haven't played XIV since Stormblood came out
[3:59:30] <+Fynale> I still have a gauss barrel on a bar to remind me of how stupid it was
[3:59:30] <Darkrenai> Still unfortunate they havent given us these garlean armour suits
[3:59:31] <RazHarvey> gotta level everything
[3:59:32] <%isolex_> no astro :((((((((((((
[3:59:33] <geneshaft_flcl> they should add Timemage and make its were it heals with nuthing but DOTS
[3:59:35] <%Calern> level mech coward
[3:59:37] <+skylaryeah> what do you think of red mage?
[3:59:37] <%falineth> more DOTs?
[3:59:38] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Wonder how my character is doing
[3:59:38] <Monkeyweed21> but MCH has BIG NUMBER
[3:59:40] <%Ilpala> Level Red Mage instead of Summoner, it's so much better
[3:59:40] <%valriot> FUCK OFF MCH IS BIG DICK
[3:59:44] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger basically they started "healslut" in which you do sex shit and sex punishments while playing mercy
[3:59:45] <@JustinianKnight> MCH is great
[3:59:45] <%heartlesshealer> it's the entire reason I had so much fun playing scholar when I had an account. Dot management made sure I was always engaged and felt like I was actually doing something
[3:59:47] <%spiritofmojave> Dancer is fun af, but laughable damage
[3:59:53] <HairballCT> ‚ñ™Ô∏è
[3:59:53] <+Arkfyre> Imagine not liking automaton queen or giga drill breaker
[3:59:54] <Azathotic> MCH GETS A ROBOT STAND PAT
[3:59:55] <Monkeyweed21> MCH IS BIGG NUMBER
[3:59:58] <%Rumbutt> Dancer hurts my hand
[4:00:01] <Lmsd944> You can summon the terminator what machinist
[4:00:04] <@JustinianKnight> yes
[4:00:05] <@Velyndra> yes

[4:00:10] <%Calern> big dick MCH represent
[4:00:14] <%SomeSageAdvice> justinian has it
[4:00:17] <%Muzzle131> here's an idea for a new healer: a melee healer
[4:00:17] <Monkeyweed21> I have the Char mount
[4:00:18] <%Owkono> I just have to level 2 of the healers, then all 80
[4:00:21] <%spiritofmojave> Justnian was showin it earlier
[4:00:22] <yourliteraldog> Heal Dominatrix
[4:00:24] <Lt_Campbell> the Camel Bird
[4:00:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 I don't understand. Why they do dis?
[4:00:36] <%cureneckbeard> The Umaru mount?
[4:00:38] <vVAstrAVv> amaro is lamw
[4:00:40] <yourliteraldog> Those tanks gotta take it
[4:00:42] <%Swampykins> Evil looking?!
[4:00:47] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger for porn. they'd moan into the mike and suck a dild into it it was wack as shit
[4:00:48] <@JustinianKnight> my good boi Amaro
[4:00:50] <BlueLunecy> Amaro shoulda been a reward for clearing the Crystalline Mean quests
[4:00:50] <%spiritofmojave> It's pretty shutup
[4:00:50] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[4:00:52] <%Rumbutt> Amaro is cool af
[4:00:53] <+Fynale> amaro's are good boys
[4:00:54] <+Malacious> "evil looking"
[4:00:54] <Azathotic> I like Amaros, but not that much...
[4:00:55] <%Swampykins> Amaro are cute as hell.
[4:00:55] <Ciglossonjr> Including crafters and gatherers?
[4:00:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 lol wow
[4:00:57] <RazHarvey> lol
[4:00:59] <@JustinianKnight> I just wish you could have it out like Chocobo
[4:00:59] <+metalsiren31> Amaro is ugly pvpSass
[4:01:01] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> pat smackin his lips like paige
[4:01:02] <%cappyd33> SETO IS COOL AS SHIT
[4:01:03] <%heartlesshealer> weird pre-req for a bird type mount, but if it looks like a dark chocobo then that's fine
[4:01:03] <Monkeyweed21> pat you are the lame
[4:01:05] <SweetCuppingCake> They are super precious
[4:01:05] <cherrycottontail> I don't know why they make the amaro amount so high on requirements
[4:01:05] <Lt_Campbell> thats just hate speech from soneone without an amaro
[4:01:07] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Amaro is really cute...
[4:01:08] <bigunclebungus> hey pat, hows the club foot doing?
[4:01:08] <%LaughingCatt> Amaro is blessed
[4:01:10] <Ciglossonjr> Alright cool
[4:01:14] <super_robo_mg> amaro should be a companion like chocobo
[4:01:18] <%SoleilAstier> SoleilAstier subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 8 months. god damn.
[4:01:18] <+Fynale> they're talking chocobos
[4:01:21] <%madskull456> is it weird to level up another tank before dps?
[4:01:22] <redrins> they'd prolly make a good steak
[4:01:26] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger dude there's like. fuckin pictures if you look up "healslut" that has a list of punishments and rewards about riding dildos and shit its so insane
[4:01:28] <Monkeyweed21> Did you whitewash history or not?
[4:01:29] <%Alpha8087> I prefer Yojimbird
[4:01:29] <%Rumbutt> @super_robo_mg you're right and you should say it

[4:01:49] <errasos> is there is sonic armor
[4:01:53] <vVAstrAVv> they just look plain to me. unless the player mounts different from the ones npcs use in the msq
[4:01:54] <geneshaft_flcl> If only your could go fast here
[4:01:57] <%Rumbutt> Weirdos in MSQ roulette are the best, I take a screenshot every time that Praetorium opens
[4:01:58] <%ArchimerDreatect> 10 minutes of Nero monologuing whilse he waits for hsi hammer to unstick form the ceilign with the experimental gorilla glue
[4:01:59] <RazHarvey> very nice bargin bin lightning
[4:02:01] <%Shadicara> Maybe they should step their game up Kappa
[4:02:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @madskull456 Not at all. I have DRK at 80, and PAL at 67. It's good to have tank variety.

[4:02:16] <+AXL808> Always annoys me to get this raid because of the cutscenes
[4:02:20] <%Rumbutt> I love this song

[4:02:29] <errasos> cool hammer

[4:02:31] <super_robo_mg> giant plastic Playskool hammer
[4:02:33] <+skylaryeah> this roulette is like time to put on a movie in another window
[4:02:33] <Lt_Campbell> I always liked Nero. He has conviction
[4:02:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 I guess I HAVE to go do research now...
[4:02:34] <%Tucker0603> @patstaresat I call lahabrea Lahablablabla cause he never shuts up
[4:02:34] <%Valdorick> Did that hammer just make a slashing noise?
[4:02:34] <Ashecroft> Dont question it Pat
[4:02:35] <RazHarvey> i want nero for smash
[4:02:36] <%Shadicara> NO SKIP
[4:02:37] <+AXL808> aetherspace
[4:02:37] <Azathotic> Nero duct-taped it to the ceiling
[4:02:39] <%SomeSageAdvice> and where does it go? he never touches it again
[4:02:39] <%heartlesshealer> from Heavenward
[4:02:43] <hoodedlefty> Oh yes, I remember when Nero was just a lame baby
[4:02:44] <%Rumbutt> If Warriors can't get that hammer they need to add it for them
[4:02:46] <%Owkono> from shut up
[4:02:47] <+RenoDeGeneric> The same place Garland's sword and Terry Bogard's hat go
[4:02:49] <HairballCT> that hammer is such a kh design LUL
[4:02:55] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger look up healslut and you'll see a bunch of images listing punishments for dying/not healing people properly and shit. its so insane and they even had a logo that was the demon mercy skin
[4:02:57] <bestwaifuritsu> It comes from...Hammer Space. Cuz nero totally has that kind of technology.
[4:02:59] <%madskull456> I love tanks LuvCool
[4:03:04] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt They should have set it up so that if everyone in the party already saw the cutscene the you can skip it
[4:03:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> His hammer reminds me of the Gunhammer from Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.
[4:03:06] <geneshaft_flcl> remember when you had to try to clears these.
[4:03:07] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt 30 seconds?

[4:03:32] <+NitronStreams> "murder committed live on stream"
[4:03:40] <super_robo_mg> Pat: this fight is a joke *immediately goes down to half HP*
[4:03:40] <@JustinianKnight> this track is great and you hear it like once
[4:03:41] <%Calern> @ScreamLord people would kick new players or leave if they did that
[4:03:44] <%joeobo2> when do you think the last limit break was used in this dungeon
[4:03:50] <%chambatron> Pat will yuo ever play overwatch again or it's run its course?
[4:03:53] <%tusk102> @super_robo_mg but did he die tho
[4:03:59] <RazHarvey> so is nero a red knight? Kappa
[4:04:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Helljump3r6 Even a party of folks who are just barely level 50 can still crush him.
[4:04:08] <%heartlesshealer> orb of cards?

[4:16:15] <+Helljump3r6> deaf people can talk on the phone....
[4:16:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Stop talking to me
[4:16:16] <@SSaryn> Why is she complaining about the best part.
[4:16:17] <ThDark> Good? You're not paying to talk to him, just to get a ride. How weird
[4:16:18] <%spiritofmojave> you're literally there to get a ride and maybe nothing else, FUCK OFF
[4:16:28] <%trustycoyote> You paying for a ride, not a conversation.
[4:16:28] <$Dakuu75> Yeah
[4:16:31] <Ciglossonjr> Did they implement that "Shut the fuck up driver" button yet?
[4:16:32] <%isolex_> I propose that you have the option for a quiet or talkative driver on uber or lyft
[4:16:35] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Dead silence >>>>>> any talking at all
[4:16:35] <FalseEyeD> Ew, gross
[4:16:35] <RazHarvey> women :)
[4:16:36] <bear_breaker20> actually talking on the phone while driving was the problem...
[4:16:38] <FutaSnek> MAYBE YOUR GOING SOMEWHERE SHITTY
[4:16:39] <%heartlesshealer> Your driver is not your bartender
[4:16:39] <%cowardman93> if that driver says nothing I tip 5 stars
[4:16:40] <%EpsilonDSC> yeah nah
[4:16:41] <undagi> i prefer them not talking to me, but if they do that's fine

[4:16:51] <+AXL808> fuck that and those people who want a conversation
[4:16:53] <@mothmandraws> cant remember
[4:16:53] <Aydarkzero> whenever i get in an Uber i don't say a word
[4:16:53] <%D3rrtyD4n> pay a therapist
[4:16:54] <$Dakuu75> Wrong
[4:16:54] <%EpsilonDSC> I'm glad every uber drive i get does not talk
[4:16:55] <%spiritofmojave> forced chats are butt
[4:16:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> I don't mind a conversation.
[4:16:59] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i've never used an uber in my life because i just drive or ride a bike
[4:16:59] <@mothmandraws> think being on phone and driving is ilelgal in uk
[4:17:00] <%rdark_ksu> Just put up a sign that says tap once for talk twice for stfu
[4:17:01] <%cvp5127> 0/10 did not talk to me
[4:17:07] <RazHarvey> especially you
[4:17:07] <%valriot> If it's a regular driver, chat it up, but otherwise no
[4:17:08] <Ciglossonjr> Says you Pat
[4:17:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I'm already miserable, don't talk to me stranger.
[4:17:12] <@SSaryn> Unless you strike up a conversation with the driver themselves, why the FUCK would you wanna talk to the driver.
[4:17:12] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[4:17:12] <FutaSnek> I see

[4:17:17] <+AXL808> Our Savior Pat
[4:17:17] <%skizzuto> says the man who advocates for littering
[4:17:18] <yourliteraldog> Said like a true american
[4:17:18] <TofuNyan> I agree with you. Whenever I'm in a Cab/Taxi w/e i don't want to talk, just take me to my destination, PLEASE.
[4:17:19] <%tusk102> PAT YOU LITTER
[4:17:20] <Whiteowlsmith> to be fair you shouldn't be talking while driving but also you're not entitled for conversation
[4:17:21] <bleugh> TRUUUU
[4:17:21] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I agree, though.
[4:17:23] <Iamdenril> i make light conversation with them but if they dont wanna talk thats super cool
[4:17:23] <+NitronStreams> but what if pat was the bad?
[4:17:24] <$Dakuu75> 10/10 did not talk to me
[4:17:25] <bear_breaker20> "its your fault" - Pat the litterer
[4:17:26] <%heartlesshealer> that's the worst person to have talk to you on a forced ride
[4:17:27] <RazHarvey> pat is perfect in every way
[4:17:27] <%cowardman93> I had one Uber who tried talking to me but I was drunk out of my ass at 4AM so just chatted shit for the ride
[4:17:29] <%tusk102> LITTERING IS A MINOR PROBLEM
[4:17:30] <Whiteowlsmith> *talking on your phone
[4:17:32] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> That, but unironically.

[4:17:40] <%YakumoYomi> Where the hot Viera, tho?
[4:17:45] <ha2ken> They need a TALK/DON'T TALK button and also signs for whether the driver is/is not a talker...
[4:17:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SSaryn what if the driver knows something about your destination like if the resturant you are going to failed its health check?
[4:17:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I wonder why
[4:17:49] <redrins> a little ball of spite, pat is
[4:17:49] <%rdark_ksu> @PatStaresAt You like fishing, how bout camping?

[4:18:25] <ha2ken> Pat is not paying taxes for them obviously...
[4:18:27] <redrins> people who litter abroad are assholes
[4:18:27] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat isn't upset that he's the worst, because he's the best at being the worst
[4:18:27] <CrypticMochi> They should shove that litter down your orb cracks
[4:18:28] <FalseEyeD> Litter on Bunny Island = Death Sentence
[4:18:30] <%Zulrez> pat you're gonna make that one old ass indian from the 80s commercial cry
[4:18:32] <BlackMage66652> Littering is for cunts, tbh

[4:19:26] <Katorskay> streets are fucked then
[4:19:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I bet Logan Paul littered a lot
[4:19:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt when you buy a drink or something, you stand next to the trash can, drink it, and throw it away right?
[4:19:30] <$Dakuu75> Not wrong
[4:19:31] <%Shadicara> I mean if they're gonna assume it anyway...
[4:19:31] <Sol_Install> hunterxhunter guy lives in a trash pile

[4:19:39] <Lt_Campbell> Japan has a cultural expectation of 'Take care of your shit, we are an island'
[4:19:42] <+AXL808> AND STREAM YOURSELF DOING IT
[4:19:42] <%SomeSageAdvice> even when there is litter in Japan, its all set in a pile, by the edge of the street usually by a thing that will keep it from blowing around
[4:19:42] <@commanderclaw> Social Moors?
[4:19:43] <%heartlesshealer> If you get a drink from the vending machines, finish it nearby so you can put it in the recycle.
[4:19:44] <FalseEyeD> Sounds like a scapegoat, but also dipped in truth
[4:19:48] <+JavaManJoJo> But what if Paige and Fuggins were around? Then you could annoy them and then blame them too.
[4:19:54] <%Puhff> social morays
[4:19:55] <%heartlesshealer> YES
[4:19:56] <%rdark_ksu> vending machine

[4:20:08] <yourliteraldog> CHUGG IT
[4:20:08] <%cureneckbeard> Why can't you just walk to the next machine and drop your can off there
[4:20:08] <%Verd_254> did they do anything for gathering to make leveling easier the way they did for crafting?
[4:20:13] <%heartlesshealer> important tourist info
[4:20:14] <%trustycoyote> They expect you to pound it?!
[4:20:14] <%spiritofmojave> that's why Kiryu does it!
[4:20:18] <yourliteraldog> I do like chugging culture
[4:20:20] <%tusk102> kiryu does it!
[4:20:21] <%snausages_> Oh its like Shem,ue
[4:20:22] <FalseEyeD> My... Bag?
[4:20:23] <FutaSnek> DRINKING ON THE GO IS ROOD AF
[4:20:25] <%snausages_> Shenmue
[4:20:25] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the drinks are smaller than you think though
[4:20:26] <ThDark> Just like my Shenmues
[4:20:29] <MattoBii> walking and eating/drinking is considered improper in Japan, yeah
[4:20:32] <%cowardman93> there's often a bench nearby vending machines from my time out in Japan
[4:20:36] <@SSaryn> They're there to hang out and grab a drink basically.
[4:20:37] <Anr1ck> Such devastation, this was not my intention!
[4:20:40] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt what word are you saying?
[4:20:40] <@JustinianKnight> no eating or drinking on the street usually yeah
[4:20:42] <$Hommando> No
[4:20:42] <%MegboyManuel> this was not my intention, ascian
[4:20:43] <%isolex_> LITTERING
[4:20:43] <%heartlesshealer> If you do not pound the drink right there, there is no where to throw it into
[4:20:47] <+DesertPenguin> Every place of business has a garbage you fool
[4:20:47] <Dr_Mooose> or just find a trash can
[4:20:49] <+JadeKapa> yeah eating while walking is generally a nono
[4:20:51] <%trustycoyote> That just a rude assumption!
[4:20:51] <%heartlesshealer> so littering by default
[4:20:52] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> crazy to think youll keep the trash one you
[4:20:55] <+DesertPenguin> Trash cans are not that rare dude
[4:20:56] <%Shadicara> So what you're saying is japan has mind goblins
[4:20:56] <%JackKrauser> I would not survive in Japan as a tourist alone.
[4:21:00] <MattoBii> Dotombori
[4:21:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Uh, in a trash can? Or just stuff it in your pants until you come across a trashcan.
[4:21:01] <CrypticMochi> I like enjoying my drinks, not chugging it
[4:21:05] <%MegboyManuel> pat thats a terrible bard glam
[4:21:05] <APsaull> you'd throw it out at the other trash by the literally hundreds of other vending machines?
[4:21:06] <%D3rrtyD4n> i wont eat or drink in store, but on the streets? little too strict for me
[4:21:10] <+DesertPenguin> I always walk around with a messenger bag so I could stash it in there
[4:21:10] <MattoBii> Sotenbori is the fake name
[4:21:12] <@SSaryn> Crab place.
[4:21:12] <bestwaifuritsu> oh god, the ultima particle effect is still in the cutscene
[4:21:14] <%CalderGaming> the real one is dotenbori

[4:21:39] <%rdark_ksu> Weird as I'm watching your Japan vids right now
[4:21:42] <%CalderGaming> ...dotonbori
[4:21:44] <+DesertPenguin> I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF THAT'S OKAY
[4:21:48] <+DesertPenguin> That's bull shit. I do what I want

[4:21:58] <FutaSnek> I love being a filthy american
[4:21:58] <+King_floppy> theres trashcans everywhere
[4:21:58] <+AXL808> i'm surprised Japan would put up with so many tourists for a major events like the Olympics
[4:21:59] <%cowardman93> I really like that in Japan. It feels rude as shit to walk around stuffing your face
[4:22:00] <Katorskay> i swear
[4:22:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I'm an adult, I can take care of my own trash.
[4:22:04] <FalseEyeD> I do what I want! I do what I want!
[4:22:04] <%rdark_ksu> @PatStaresAt Kansai or Tokyo man?
[4:22:07] <%chambatron> This mission on stream is the chillest fucking thing ever
[4:22:08] <+JadeKapa> easily found public toilets is the price we pay for clean streets
[4:22:10] <+DesertPenguin> I AM AN ADULT!!!
[4:22:10] <%heartlesshealer> but Japan is confident that gaijins cannot adult just fine
[4:22:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Fuck Rome, they dead
[4:22:13] <+AXL808> that statement alone shows how wrong they are
[4:22:15] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> That is a distinctly Canadian view
[4:22:16] <@commanderclaw> When in rome fuck a cute greek dude
[4:22:17] <Dr_Mooose> what if you got places to be and that's your only time to get food.
[4:22:18] <%valriot> I feel like drinking while walking is just annoying anyway, you can't drink properly like that
[4:22:20] <illicitdonut> Love ultima weapons theme
[4:22:20] <Sol_Install> fuck that, most people walk with their cellphones 24/7 in their face
[4:22:20] <%crimsonharvest> Sorry Japan thats bullshit, I live my live being ground down under the heel of wage thieves I don't have time to only eat standing still.
[4:22:21] <%SomeSageAdvice> unless you want the Yakuza to getcha
[4:22:22] <T_Sasquatch> nah fuck that , i wont litter but i sure as hell wont chug it
[4:22:24] <%Tearonex> when in Rome, do as the Japanese do
[4:22:24] <%Shadicara> Lies
[4:22:24] <CrypticMochi> I will walk, I can take care of my own trash
[4:22:25] <%tusk102> it's not about how adultish you are, it's about if you respect their culture @PatStaresAt
[4:22:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Considering how all countries hate tourists, you gotta present your best self
[4:22:27] <+DesertPenguin> Pat, you're objectively wrong. Crazy Talk activate
[4:22:28] <bleugh> do you think majima litters
[4:22:28] <DashXero> I'd only use those rules under threat of physical force or imprisonment.
[4:22:29] <%rdark_ksu> Yea thats how it is
[4:22:30] <%JackKrauser> @DesertPenguin Damn right you are. Keepy adulting.
[4:22:34] <ha2ken> Assume the locals hate you and act accordingly
[4:22:36] <redrins> "you dont pay our taxes, be nice and dont be an asshole in your country" should be the general rule
[4:22:37] <+DesertPenguin> *hands on hips* Yea!
[4:22:39] <FalseEyeD> The Leaf has a command spell activated when you go overseas to obey
[4:22:41] <HairballCT> you're not just representing yourself, you're representing your home as well
[4:22:43] <%spiritofmojave> To be fair it's not like you represent all of Canada LUL
[4:22:43] <stevenellis386> Fair enough.I just hope no one went to jail simply because they littered.
[4:22:45] <$Dakuu75> Be diplomatic
[4:22:46] <%ChaosAethr> Dont Be a Logan Paul in another Country
[4:22:47] <BusterWoIf> It's the people who shourts that they're an Adult is the problem lol
[4:22:48] <T_Sasquatch> yea sure , i still wont litte
[4:22:51] <+King_floppy> I also literally sip my coffee for an hour. I aint staying in one place to do that unless im at a diner
[4:22:51] <%chambatron> AS a guest Japan is like "Can you fucking not"
[4:22:51] <FutaSnek> Yeah it's probably a good rule of thumb not to be a shit in forign lands'
[4:22:54] <yourliteraldog> You gotta put some specc on they culture
[4:22:55] <+DesertPenguin> Haha
[4:22:55] <%valriot> This song is an OmegaBanger
[4:22:58] <%ShawnTK_> Pat represents the entire west when he goes to Japan because they don't know where the fuck he's from
[4:23:03] <%JD_Lars> This music is great
[4:23:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Fuck Logan Paul, that pos
[4:23:05] <MattoBii> yeah Singapore's the one that'll jail you for that
[4:23:06] <%rdark_ksu> No jail in Singapore only death
[4:23:07] <%bevyrage> psaBig REMINDER: Japan values the community over the individual. Tourists brandishing their individual rights and trampling over the Japanese standards are the reason why we got the Paul brothers to happen.
[4:23:08] <FutaSnek> They'll cane you
[4:23:09] <$RetroCop87> That Boss music was KICKIN
[4:23:09] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I think N Korea too
[4:23:11] <FalseEyeD> Singapore = Cane Capitol
[4:23:14] <ScreamLord> Eventually Japan is gonna get so pissed everything will have "THROW THIS IN TO THE FUCKING GARBAGE FOREIGNER!"
[4:23:16] <%SomeSageAdvice> of all the places to cause trouble, Japan is not a place you should be confident to do it
[4:23:16] <%JackKrauser> Yeah... don't go to Singapore.
[4:23:17] <%heartlesshealer> True facts

[4:23:20] <redrins> absolutely no weed there either
[4:23:24] <%nmaten> you get caned if you graffiti in singapore
[4:23:27] <Whiteowlsmith> it's an attitude like that that perpetuates americans as being rude as fuck
[4:23:31] <%tusk102> @zenraider buffs i think
[4:23:31] <%heartlesshealer> Bards are there to bard
[4:23:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> But all my lady-boys are in singapore
[4:23:36] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> They're a totalitarian police state, but rather than do purges or whatever they just make sure you don't chew bubblegum.
[4:23:38] <yourliteraldog> They excute you for drugs
[4:23:39] <%bigboy3d> Jail for littering? I kinda like that

[4:24:15] <BlackMage66652> I generally buy drinks to facilitate my relief of thirst during a day. I'm not gonna fucking chug it outside the goddamn store.
[4:24:18] <%Kiiper> Gaius doesn't start the race war
[4:24:20] <%rdark_ksu> Would you say should have a guide/ scheduled thing to visit Japan or is winging it worth the freedom?
[4:24:21] <@Velyndra> Gaius Chad Baelsar
[4:24:21] <ScreamLord> Like every other Disney villain

[4:30:55] <TioXyco> Oh yeaaaaaah... Greg has the White Raven's Spear...
[4:31:00] <@commanderclaw> Battle on the Big Bridge is a killer track
[4:31:00] <Crimpson> @PatStaresAt So why no songs bro?
[4:31:00] <%heartlesshealer> hippocerf
[4:31:01] <TioXyco> I forgot about that
[4:31:02] <%Puhff> Wtf I had no idea Gilgamesh was in FF14
[4:31:03] <Monkeyweed21> bards are lame compared to MCH
[4:31:07] <yourliteraldog> No pat is okay with mages of all races
[4:31:09] <%crimsonharvest> No vocal track is worth a single shit except for in FF14 so its hard to disagree
[4:31:13] <%Rumbutt> I really like Greg 3
[4:31:18] <%Puhff> I've never seen this Trial in my life
[4:31:19] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt what do bards do? buffs?
[4:31:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Battle of Big Bridge is so great
[4:31:23] <%snausages_> Black Mage is high skill level DPS, its the Vergil class
[4:31:24] <+projectmanatees> This is part of the the greatest sidequest line ever
[4:31:24] <deadbeat34> My orchestra performed this song!
[4:31:27] <@SSaryn> Ey to the bois who wanna know where that vod is with the hotbar shit https://youtu.be/_XjFUhaNGks

[4:31:45] <Crimpson> Apparently you don't remember how to play BRd either lol
[4:31:46] <deadbeat34> Its a bop!
[4:31:48] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Bards are just poet pickpockets when you think about it
[4:31:49] <@SSaryn> https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/uiguide/ here is also the UI guide.
[4:31:52] <BusterWoIf> @l3sovikk No
[4:31:55] <%heartlesshealer> how does confusion work in an MMO?
[4:31:58] <stevenellis386> I dont want to p2p i meant
[4:31:59] <+projectmanatees> Hildabrand questline is must
[4:32:05] <%tusk102> @heartlesshealer you hit your teammates
[4:32:08] <%crimsonharvest> it makes you attack the nearest/random sometimes target
[4:32:10] <+l3sovikk> Did Pat coward out?
[4:32:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat murdering the RDM and making me work
[4:32:15] <%Rumbutt> Really looking forward to the Hildy questline this expac
[4:32:18] <%cureneckbeard> In FFV you can skip most of the bridge fights by running along the edge, but I intentionally ran back and did all the fights just to hear more of this song
[4:32:23] <%MegboyManuel> When you kill the rezmage
[4:32:27] <@mothmandraws> honestly im fine if hilde takes a break
[4:32:31] <%sshen> people still can't get a hang of shinryu EX and got flying off the edge
[4:32:33] <%heartlesshealer> @tusk102 But is it forced, or are all your hostile actions just aimed at teammates?
[4:32:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> @heartlesshealer usually reversed controls
[4:32:37] <@mothmandraws> stormblood felt thin on material/repeating jokes
[4:32:39] <%sshen> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn

[4:42:40] <Das_Beergut> @j0ustar Do you remember the debacle from "The Division"? Body blocking people from the first door in the game.
[4:42:53] <%MegboyManuel> @depressed_skeleton so Mothman

[4:43:00] <%j0ustar> This is about as much content as staring at white rocks- oh

[4:44:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> ELMO
[4:44:06] <Das_Beergut> @j0ustar ...you'd be the one in front of the door, wouldn't you?

[4:44:12] <Lt_Campbell> shut the fuck up elmo
[4:44:12] <%Ranryu692> What do you use the money for, then? Drugs?
[4:44:12] <+necrocannibal2> what do you use the gil for?
[4:44:13] <%crimsonharvest> I've never gone below about 9 million i always buy new gear if i start to get higher
[4:44:14] <%Valdorick> Buying Elmo?
[4:44:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is why people have hids because servents are expensive
[4:44:22] <%crimsonharvest> but i never tried to buy a house those people are crazy

[4:44:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmm rocks
[4:44:54] <Edrem> Did you know there is a new action that shows every item you have that can be extracted for materia
[4:44:58] <%j0ustar> @Das_Beergut depends on the amount of jank-to-fun I'm dealing with in game
[4:45:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Where is paige?
[4:45:07] <%depressed_skeleton> 40 gold!
[4:45:09] <%Lapinelis> I feel bad about knowing where all the mining mats are by heart
[4:45:09] <%MegboyManuel> yellow alumen makes Atrociraptor skin, which sells for like, 3k each
[4:45:14] <%mMayrro> hey you're the one who said it

[4:46:15] <Das_Beergut> How much of the KFC deal do you think you could handle? Could you solo 8 large drinks, 8 sandwiches, and 4 eggrolls?
[4:46:15] <%MegboyManuel> Levelling BLU has been dumb fun
[4:46:17] <Edrem> BLU mage 1-60 stream when LUL

[4:46:45] <@mothmandraws> do the leveling glitch
[4:46:48] <Finaldragoon> imagine not liking Blue Mage
[4:46:49] <%Eaglestrike117> Eaglestrike117 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! So i see that you only have gunbreaker at 62, is that cause you only just started leveling it or you tried it and didnt like it? How do you feel about it?
[4:46:52] <%Neo_Kaiser> I thought everybody was excited for the Blue Mage.
[4:46:52] <Das_Beergut> @Ciglossonjr Have you heard about someone called the Onion Knight?
[4:46:53] <@commanderclaw> I wish BLU was a leigt class
[4:46:53] <%spiritofmojave> It's not a long leveling process lmao
[4:46:55] <%MegboyManuel> Yeah it's just a lot of grinding once you get sticky tongue on BLU
[4:46:57] <@JustinianKnight> you dont even have to glitch
[4:46:57] <%MegboyManuel> no it's not
[4:46:57] <@Velyndra> they didn't
[4:46:59] <@mothmandraws> no not that one
[4:47:00] <@Velyndra> iirc
[4:47:02] <%ClericOfSparda> makes sense
[4:47:03] <%mikesapartment> you can still get a buddy to level you
[4:47:04] <+Wildpandaman> Hope you enjoyed 5.2 This have been one of my favourite patches in ff14 in both content & Story
[4:47:06] <%depressed_skeleton> @PatStaresAt Ever wanna have a just sit & chat stream one day?
[4:47:09] <@Velyndra> they 'fixed' it
[4:47:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Didn't you say you wanted to make this a "Weekly grind"
[4:47:10] <@mothmandraws> the one where you get lvl 60s to kill stuff for you
[4:47:11] <%ShawnTK_> what leveling glitch?
[4:47:11] <%valriot> This stream is my podcast to grinding Ishgard crafting
[4:47:13] <+UnpronounceableName> no excuse LUL
[4:47:15] <@JustinianKnight> just have one other person kill the thing
[4:47:16] <+joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Ur mom is a glitch and also gone
[4:47:22] <+joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> zing
[4:47:22] <%MegboyManuel> the glitch still works, you do the 'train" in Asyz La
[4:47:24] <%kujofire990> what barding is that on your chocoboo?
[4:47:27] <@mothmandraws> you get like 7 lvl 80s and go to azys la

[4:47:39] <+necrocannibal2> I don't get MMOs, why not just have everyone at "endgame" instead of having to do boring pointless quests to get to it
[4:47:40] <bxdragon> Why is Pat beating up rocks?
[4:47:40] <@mothmandraws> you get like 5 levels a kill
[4:47:48] <%ecolli37108> they fixed being able to hit something then swap classes to get xp, but you can still just run around and tag stuff and have a friend murder it for you
[4:47:49] <TioXyco> why not use auto-gather?
[4:47:52] <bxdragon> What did they ever do to him?
[4:47:52] <Neo_Kaiser> Oh no! I'm watching the viewer count drop in real time!
[4:47:55] <%MegboyManuel> You can use like 1 level 80 to a party of blue mages
[4:47:59] <%depressed_skeleton> Sniper!

My parents used to refer to him as Fat Fuck, because he tried to get my dad, who was the super, fired for not letting him make an illegal renovation in his apartment. Fuck that guy

[4:50:34] <stevenellis386> Pat stop dying bruh
[4:50:37] <CrazyMedicine> 7 minutes before alarm
[4:50:47] <Das_Beergut> You're late because you accepted that cookie trade, the potato F'd you
[4:50:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @TioXyco I don't care for Krile
[4:50:58] <%MegboyManuel> that potato DID fuck you
[4:51:01] <%crimsonharvest> What I always couldnt figure out was how nerds were getting thousands of clusters
[4:51:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pipin is OK
[4:51:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @necrocannibal2 And honestly, you don't really need to grind stuff to keep up with the story. FFXIV at least does a good job giving you what you need to stay relevant to current story quests.
[4:51:16] <dan_g_v> revelaitons finished already?
[4:51:18] <@mothmandraws> honestly
[4:51:20] <CrazyMedicine> ye
[4:51:28] <@mothmandraws> gearing is only actually important if you are wanting to do savage

[4:51:35] <@mothmandraws> you can just wear whatever for most content
[4:51:44] <Das_Beergut> FFXIV Rule 18: If you can blame your problems on a potato, you should do so.
[4:51:46] <TioXyco> linkpearl
[4:51:47] <%MegboyManuel> well a tank should probably gear up to survive shit
[4:51:50] <Ciglossonjr> Tell that to that one Samurai job quest Moth
[4:51:53] <%Kiiper> MOTH Don't tell people that
[4:51:59] <%AquilaHarukaze> Get your psaBig HP
[4:52:00] <+necrocannibal2> @King_Wolf_Rigger what I don't get is why these low level quests have to be fetching and pointless. I actually played an MMO that I liked, DDO, but it didn't have those kinds of quests. all quests were "raid-like", had a storyline and felt like they matter. not sure if I can explain it better than this.
[4:52:03] <@mothmandraws> just ironworks all game ez
[4:52:03] <%Kiiper> That how you end up with Piety dark knights
[4:52:05] <%MegboyManuel> an under-geared tank sounds like a bad idea
[4:52:07] <Ciglossonjr> The one on the weaboo boat
[4:52:12] <+necrocannibal2> @King_Wolf_Rigger basically, I just don't like the "pure" grinding
[4:52:13] <%sshen> Haha time to go stand with the huge crowd by the fishing boat
[4:52:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @necrocannibal2 The "end game" content is just for people who beat the story, and want to have fun wasting time. In that regards, MMOs are just RPGs with a ton of time wasting stuff when you're done with the story.
[4:52:19] <%albedo455> under 15 min

[4:55:09] <TioXyco> Dwarven Cotton Balls are not timed
[4:55:12] <bxdragon> As long as he doesn't touch the balls its not gay.
[4:55:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @necrocannibal2 As for forcing you to level up from level 1, that at least teaches you how the class works. It sucks when someone pays for a full level up and joins you for end game raids when they don't know how their class works.

[4:59:09] <%Afterman_> GNB is the most fun tank class ive ever played
[4:59:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @necrocannibal2 Not that I'm trying to sell you on the game lol. There is usually a trial period up to level 30, and if you buy the game you also get a free month of subscription, so it's fairly friendly for folks who just want to give it a try.
[4:59:13] <%spiritofmojave> Get your tanks to 80 Pat! Love tanking thanks to you.
[4:59:23] <%cvp5127> can you solo this game?

[5:04:22] <kiso52> omg out of context pat saying "lots of plump worms around here" gotta be a meme template
[5:04:23] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> paige doesnt need tentacles
[5:04:24] <%mMayrro> she was probably like "what's that"
[5:04:26] <%PlainSimpleTailor> The plumpest worms with the most bountiful thuds made upon the boxspring
[5:04:26] <%Shadowthedigger> Is that what you call it with paige?

[5:04:59] <+Wildpandaman> You need some advice on Ruby Ex i have cleared it 20 times if you need anything to know before going into the fight pat?
[5:05:00] <%ArcanumMBD> Ruby EX is way easier than Hades EX. Especially since you get a checkpoint in Ruby EX
[5:05:02] <%LaughingCatt> Ruby Greatsword is neat
[5:05:06] <@mothmandraws> beat me more ramuh

[5:05:39] <Monkeyweed21> Too many deep throated Hard Rs
[5:05:39] <%ShawnTK_> Phase 1 is pretty simple and easy, Phase 2 has like 1 mechanic that might fuck some people over

[5:19:01] <truta_> ok i'm not that impressed anymore
[5:19:03] <Das_Beergut> Pat Boivin's new book: "Will there Ever be a Rainbow?"
[5:19:05] <Graxe_> Ala Mhigo is all the way east past Gridania and Ul'dah
[5:19:06] <%isolex_> psaCrazy
[5:19:06] <%Kiiper> You're in the strait between La Noscea and Thanalan
[5:19:09] <%Zepik> yeah crystarium is right next to it too
[5:19:10] <Sol_Install> it's the hat
[5:19:12] <%Calern> yule duh

[5:19:56] <%isolex_> IS IT TIME
[5:19:57] <%mMayrro> PogChamp 3
[5:20:01] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> not a cellphone in sight, just ppl living the moment
[5:20:03] <%SomeSageAdvice> im honestly super happy for all the people who actually enjoy fishing, and it looks like it could be a fun time
[5:20:06] <%isolex_> damnit
[5:20:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> dammit
[5:20:18] <%heartlesshealer> !!!
[5:20:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The RNG is absurd
[5:20:33] <%spiritofmojave> I remember catching 2 spectrals in a run and not one triggered it, it lies
[5:20:37] <%Shadowthedigger> That is fishing
[5:20:47] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> @PatStaresAt How many points do you have to get for the stuff you want?
[5:20:48] <Kahpoe_Lelou> fishing dope as shit I forget this came with the new patch. gonna have to renew my sub and save my house on top of it.
[5:20:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's like Attack Gem farming in MHW
[5:21:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> One of the reasons I can't play MMOs RNGesus has it out for me
[5:21:05] <%isolex_> @ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº minion is 5k, mount is 10
[5:21:13] <%ImmaCanuck> RNG in RNG in RNG
[5:21:15] <%spiritofmojave> Jesus
[5:21:19] <%Zepik> couldn't you also identical cast on the spectral once you catch one
[5:21:21] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> damn, 10k?
[5:21:22] <%heartlesshealer> rng to get fish, rng to proc rainbow
[5:21:23] <Das_Beergut> RNGesus
[5:21:29] <ha2ken> Life is RNG
[5:21:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> I must have done something to piss off the Good Lady
[5:21:43] <Edrem> it doesn't work
[5:21:47] <truta_> you can't identical cast the spectral fish, unfortunately
[5:21:53] <%Zepik> dunno if it works or not
[5:21:56] <%spiritofmojave> probably considered a unique or something
[5:21:59] <Kahpoe_Lelou> Did they add a relic quest step yet?
[5:22:02] <bigdrifter> Yo dawg we heard u like rng
[5:22:07] <%Valdorick> Rood
[5:22:12] <Kahpoe_Lelou> ahh okies
[5:22:18] <%mMayrro> 2 Patricks away
[5:22:27] <%heartlesshealer> pray to RNG
[5:22:31] <kiso52> plumpiest
[5:22:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Should I even finish my previous relic weapon quests?
[5:22:37] <Ciglossonjr> Is it normal to not be in an FC?
[5:22:41] <@mothmandraws> its nuts comparing how much we are getting to wow likely not getting a patch for atleast 5-6 months before expansion
[5:23:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wow is getting blueballed hardcore
[5:23:03] <%MegboyManuel> 5.2 patch is INSANE
[5:23:05] <@mothmandraws> think wow went a year at certain points new content
[5:23:11] <%isolex_> wow cool lightning is cool
[5:23:15] <Ashecroft> Multiple times, Mothman
[5:23:16] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> might it be because Square has devs that actually care about the game
[5:23:17] <%MegboyManuel> I cant believe ff14 has a better lightning than ff13 does
[5:23:18] <%valriot> LUL
[5:23:20] <RazHarvey> wow LUL
[5:23:23] <Das_Beergut> But they're willing to repackage OLD content and give it to you.
[5:23:25] <%Valdorick> The longest draught was almost TWO YEARS in wow
[5:23:25] <%spiritofmojave> I was genuinely overwhelmed/didn't know where to start with 5.2
[5:23:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Cool Lightning is so cool
[5:23:27] <%Valdorick> without a patch
[5:23:28] <%AquilaHarukaze> Fishing for spectral currents reminds me a lot of fishing for PSE Bursts in PSO2
[5:23:30] <Ashecroft> Its usual for final patches and expansion launches to be 12-13 months apart
[5:23:30] <bigdrifter> Whens the next nier raid?
[5:23:30] <%ImmaCanuck> I remember the 11 months of Siege of Orgrimmar
