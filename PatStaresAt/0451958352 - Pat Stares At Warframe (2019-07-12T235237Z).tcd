[0:09:37] <1matheuw> hey @AngriestPat didi you see the ultra cool shit on tenno live?
[0:09:39] <+bubbli97> @AngriestPat Operator Suit motivated me to do Nightwave from beginning and get to 30 as soon as possible.

[0:09:40] <%KitkatRai> BleedPurple145 bonus14 Hey pat did you know it's impossible to run through a campground? You can only ran, because it's past tents
[0:09:41] <+ThunderCloudNathan> I'm only mr7 :c
[0:09:41] <$Mendin> Pat just do minimum risk investment not the full size index
[0:09:42] <+Kareem405> just run it low risk
[0:09:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat Index is easy, go low risk and bring an Atlas
[0:09:43] <dekkitout> USE LlMBO
[0:09:43] <%BestTeaMaker> just do bronze wage
[0:09:44] <Sedrelic> just do level 1
[0:09:44] <%shadowace2400> I'll join you
[0:09:47] <Nefrette> HE NEVER DONE INDEX?
[0:09:50] <nyghtmare42> Limbo then
[0:09:52] <worldbrand> Strangledome works on them 100%
[0:09:53] <%TheWinged7> @AngriestPat if you have a range/duration khora you can just strangledomb your point
[0:09:54] <shazbot2019> limbo bubble on the index goalpost is a fun strat for the 3 game shutout
[0:09:55] <%shadowace2400> vacuum
[0:09:56] <%AncelDeLambert> strangle dome your goal, ye
[0:09:57] <%GarbageNirvana> DOn't you have to do index for a frame quest
[0:09:57] <nyghtmare42> Venari
[0:09:58] <%shadowace2400> on cat
[0:09:59] <%nmaten> gara and rhino are good
[0:09:59] <the_solarflare> gara is fine
[0:10:00] <kwall0> Xbox?
[0:10:00] <Solidus_113> Gara and Frost work great
[0:10:01] <%odiemikes> of the sand
[0:10:01] <dekkitout> Zoning on cap points
[0:10:01] <Sedrelic> and atlas can chesse the goal
[0:10:01] <1matheuw> do you have nova?
[0:10:03] <theInkShow> Gara is best
[0:10:05] <Kghaleon> Gara and Limbo could probably make it easy
[0:10:05] <Cobaltor_252> strangledome catches enemies and traps them
[0:10:05] <superbla25> frost korra limbo and gara
[0:10:05] <nyghtmare42> Venari makes it easier
[0:10:05] <%BestTeaMaker> anything with a wall
[0:10:06] <%nmaten> cause you can take 0 damage
[0:10:06] <%TheWinged7> limbo does za waldo
[0:10:07] <$Mendin> Area denial
[0:10:10] <+Mittensbro> Limbo 2 + 4 = Za Warudo
[0:10:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat set up a field in front of your own goal, the enemy can't score
[0:10:11] <nyghtmare42> Limbo-- cataclysm the goal
[0:10:11] <+CryoConduit> Anything that impairs movement. Limbo bubble can be good
[0:10:11] <%BestTeaMaker> or big area denial
[0:10:13] <+legendfather_of_giants> Rhino is great too
[0:10:14] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat block the entire goal point
[0:10:16] <+Genocalypse> Revenant with mesmer skin works really well
[0:10:17] <%sshen> Cound use slow nova
[0:10:18] <%ECRead> stop guy from scoring
[0:10:19] <%shadowace2400> Venari can use Fetch
[0:10:19] <nyghtmare42> Frost ice globe
[0:10:20] <%PaiRho> You block the goal
[0:10:22] <1matheuw> novas 4 makes evryone unable to move and take double damage
[0:10:24] <Nefrette> Slova or Rhino
[0:10:24] <shazbot2019> 2 + 4 = TIME STOP for Limboi
[0:10:25] <model_gx> jermaEarth
[0:10:26] <%BestTeaMaker> you just gotta stop them from scoring and block the goal
[0:10:31] <nyghtmare42> Hell, even Vauban can Bastille it
[0:10:32] <%THATGUY_789> I've started Warframe but plan to play after I complete FF14 so maybe next decade?
[0:10:36] <+CryoConduit> And keep 1 rhino to run points
[0:10:36] <SuperCreeperBlocks> GO GET WISP
[0:10:36] <voyagerwitch> other abilities have exceptions, limbo doesnt
[0:10:38] <StripesUltimateEdition> buy one of those roombas
[0:10:40] <%nmaten> you dont need a forma on gara
[0:10:43] <theInkShow> Oh then dont use her
[0:10:44] <mayorrev> I will rep ember till I die
[0:10:44] <+Aeoneth> Did you try to make your Inaros into an Anubis from ZOE?
[0:10:51] <$Hiro01231> I miss this game, I want my comp back so badly
[0:10:53] <%TheWinged7> not even potatoed
[0:10:54] <+Mittensbro> I dunno if it's possible to make Gara look like not shit
[0:10:54] <+AntithesisEK> neglected colgate
[0:10:55] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Hi Pat Bye Pat
[0:11:00] <the_solarflare> you basically protect the enemy base so they can't get in that's why a lot of defense oriented frames work, but gara should be more than fine
[0:11:01] <GodlyLuigi> put a potato in her lol
[0:11:03] <nyghtmare42> Go Frost
[0:11:04] <GodlyLuigi> you got 7k plat
[0:11:05] <%professormorrigan> LUL
[0:11:06] <superbla25> have atleast 2 players blocking the goal
[0:11:09] <%TheWinged7> Hah... Hah-hah
[0:11:09] <%BestTeaMaker> ha ha
[0:11:11] <mayorrev> ORDIS IS FUNNY

[0:11:13] <$OmegaWeltall> dont yell at Ordis SwiftRage
[0:11:14] <Cobaltor_252> @AngriestPat just built up my Khora so if you need any help hmu
[0:11:15] <+Genocalypse> With Revenant, you'll be invulnerable, and everytime an enemy shoots you, they'll stun themselves. Free points
[0:11:15] <loganbntn> Be nice to him!
[0:11:16] <Jeemukun> any interest in Monkey Prime Pat?
[0:11:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Saryn's good
[0:11:16] <+buttdirt> don't yell at him he's just a boi
[0:11:16] <voyagerwitch> theyre not suits ordis theyre DOLLS
[0:11:19] <%ECRead> i did Index with Limbo and just sat in front of the goal and stopped anything from scoring
[0:11:19] <%Razputin217> no bulli ordis BibleThump
[0:11:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Saryn's always good
[0:11:19] <dekkitout> Nezha?
[0:11:19] <theInkShow> Get a Saryn in party and done
[0:11:19] <shazbot2019> also Limbo can juice up his energy by rift walking. you start with 0 energy in Index and have to run straight for a blue ball, or Zenurik proc.
[0:11:20] <%Dylveryn> Just gottahave 2 people hover around their goal and the other two turning in points
[0:11:20] <benjiFG> yell more at ordis
[0:11:21] <mayorrev> Don't be mean to ordis!!
[0:11:23] <nyghtmare42> Saryn is good for killing, not so much guarding
[0:11:26] <+legendfather_of_giants> Rhino does great
[0:11:27] <$Mendin> Saryn is CC in asmuch as the C is dissolved so you dont need to C it
[0:11:28] <1matheuw> monkey is good as well
[0:11:29] <%Emperor_Machinus> Ortis is good but annoying boy
[0:11:29] <ShepardUA> Mesa is kinda CC
[0:11:32] <%demegodz> time for reeeeeading
[0:11:32] <+CryoConduit> You can run Rhino and collect points and let other people cC
[0:11:33] <%THATGUY_789> dress your dolls
[0:11:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Can't attack your points if they're dead
[0:11:39] <%TheWinged7> mokey rework is great
[0:11:44] <+Mittensbro> You can take Inaros, as long as you stay on the goal 100% of the time forever
[0:11:49] <%Dylveryn> Dylveryn converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!

[0:21:41] <+dirtyh4rr1> ora ora ora forma
[0:21:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Aura forma makes your Aura slot any polarity
[0:21:42] <%Tremuto> Aura forma is a forma that is like a forma but useless
[0:21:43] <anon_1307> lel

[0:21:46] <DeathByPoke7> ORAORAORAORA forma

[0:22:10] <%MaddyCaddy> apatDab
[0:22:24] <1matheuw> gamma colors were previously unique tho
[0:22:29] <%Zulrez> You can get aura formas in game so you didn’t really miss out
