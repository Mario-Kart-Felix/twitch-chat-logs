[0:48:49] <%Axellogic> I wish I could have played for more than an hour
[0:48:51] <+Kavtech> I love the new block-counter, but I don't know why.
[0:48:53] <+Redeyes_NI> I notice the game is just throwing up tutorial stuff at you like sekiro, no chance of you missing it like in other souls
[0:48:57] <~PatStaresAt> @loukemia83, 176 minutes

[1:02:44] <jumpyhugs> @T_Sasquatch I thought Fromsoft tweeted that it would be one of the starting classes, but I could be wrong

[1:03:57] <%bevyrage> i saw vaati show off certain secrets required you to find a vantage point then drop down on your horse, so maybe getting to the top of the building requires that

[1:05:06] <+imposter_edits> @PatStaresAt thanks for giving us a somewhat noob friendly breakdown here!
[1:05:12] <%Monkeyweed21> demo builds are always 3-6 months old at minimum
[1:05:13] <+WeLucklessJacks> Disgusting.
[1:05:18] <%RealThiele> wonder if PS5 and PC will have crossplay
[1:05:22] <BigFingerRo> @ExpressNode you mean the Pasta Rat
[1:05:28] <+OperatorPlease> @T_Sasquatch that's perfect for me
[1:05:31] <lemon_lover28> "he's a quality guy" what a compliment
[1:05:45] <+ChaosVulpes> This world looks more... alive... than any other Fromsoft game I've seen where everything is withered, dead, or dying...
[1:05:45] <cartakus> I kinda forget I'm hearing Pat

[1:06:11] <%PrimalDweeb> Good
[1:06:11] <%hax_metatron> @chaosvulpes Some item descriptions talk about a city as a destination

[1:06:19] <%tusk102> @TigerCatGo prercorded
[1:06:22] <%g0atmeal> if there's a lot more time between fights then idle music makes sense
[1:06:28] <%baka_sugoi> kill it
[1:06:31] <saddlezilla1> Elden Ring feels tonally more hopeful than Souls so far
[1:06:32] <%RealThiele> psataprocessing pat
[1:06:32] <D4N5T3P> i noticed that there's also dynamic combat music if you encounter many enemies
[1:06:34] <+sambws> Game looks technically great but I miss the feeling of dread you get from certain souls games
[1:06:35] <%TigerCatGo> Ah, ok, cool. Still neat to watch! Thanks!
[1:06:37] <huskarl_zap> chinchilla
[1:06:37] <%Prevot> I wonder, is wheather just for show or does it affect something
[1:06:41] <Treasure_Vault> I miss Prerec.
[1:06:48] <%Monkeyweed21> does pat not know what rabbits are
[1:06:51] <zashrin777> Im a fan of ambient music so thats good news
[1:06:51] <kazadog> didnt read message Madge
[1:06:55] <HarshNerf> @sambws it isn't a dark souls sequel for a reason
[1:06:56] <ExpressNode> Say that 5 times fast
[1:07:07] <D4N5T3P> guard counter is a bit op imo
[1:07:09] <%baka_sugoi> remindes me of sekiro's
[1:07:11] <+Iggysteve> oooooooo
[1:07:12] <%coward_man> holy shit the dog is just a dog
[1:07:12] <%TigerCatGo> So happy for Ambient Music. Less lonely
[1:07:13] <cartakus> That was the last thing I found before the time
[1:07:13] <iacus_> guard counter seems OP
[1:07:21] <%dekkitout> NEVER DROP THE SHIELD
[1:07:24] <+ChaosVulpes> It's nice to have something that isn't a DAMNABLE PARRY
[1:07:25] <%baka_sugoi> oh no
[1:07:25] <kazadog> yeah counter seems stupid strong
[1:07:28] <%g0atmeal> i wonder if dogs still teleport
[1:07:32] <BigFingerRo> HOoh no
[1:07:32] <%TigerCatGo> PUP SNUFFED D:
[1:07:34] <%RealThiele> its not DS4 because they backed themselves into a lore corner in DS
[1:07:34] <huskarl_zap> guard attack this casul
[1:07:38] <+Kavtech> @D4N5T3P It's only really good against enemies that stagger when you block them.
[1:07:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> nest poked
[1:07:41] <+Dives__> tough doggo
[1:07:52] <+fetrigon> aggro'd the entire outpost LUL
[1:07:52] <HarshNerf> wow these guys hit hard
[1:07:53] <%hax_metatron> I love how guard counter seems OP now, but when you hit the ‚Äúreal‚Äù bosses, you‚Äôll be super glad you have that move. I couldn‚Äôt beat the final boss without it
[1:07:58] <kazadog> yo this enemy looks sick
[1:08:02] <cartakus> Look at that spear my god!
[1:08:04] <+Nero_Cross> Holy shit that's the Red Eye spear knight moveset from DeS
[1:08:06] <%TigerCatGo> JUMP TECH PogChamp
[1:08:08] <%g0atmeal> i'm glad ds is over, from is great at making new things
[1:08:09] <+kevlarkoala> @iacus_ you say that, and then pat starts to IMMEDIATELY start fucking it up, so there's still clearly a timing window
[1:08:12] <%JoshManVGH> Did he just do a jumping spin slash?
[1:08:18] <T_Sasquatch> he just got anti aired LUL
[1:08:24] <essence_of_lariatto> finally
[1:08:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> kicks are one barehanded
[1:08:25] <Reveresao> WRONG
[1:08:28] <+ChaosVulpes> Kicks exist!!!  You need to be using a bare hand though...
[1:08:29] <%WhereIsWill> these enemies  look so cool
[1:08:32] <+RemedyofRevenge> kicks are still in the game
[1:08:34] <%valriot> Kick is on unarmed attack now
[1:08:35] <%TigerCatGo> Reggie will miss the kicking lolol
[1:08:36] <agustorm123> Just mario stomp the enemies
[1:08:37] <CriscoKnight> Kicks are the L2 of bare handed now, and it's a guaranteed guard break at full stamina
[1:08:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> isn't there a kick when you use your fists
[1:08:37] <Archmortal> it reads more to me like replacing the block once to time a parry perfectly on hit 1
[1:08:38] <%baka_sugoi> down the hole
[1:08:38] <DestroPrime83> kicking sucked in the old games If i remeber
[1:08:39] <+Kavtech> You can still kick when you have your fist out though.
[1:08:39] <Aixenn> Most people never really used kicks in Souls anyway
[1:08:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> it's the barehanded weapon art
[1:08:39] <+Dives__> You can kick without a weapon in hand
[1:08:39] <%WhereIsWill> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:08:40] <Archmortal> hit 2*
[1:08:41] <iacus_> yeah there's timing but it doesn't seem particularly tight
[1:08:43] <%antpantz> KIicks are now busted
[1:08:44] <%hax_metatron> You can kick with the bare hand move set @patstaresat
[1:08:45] <+OperatorPlease> unarmed build when
[1:08:49] <cartakus> Kick is still there when no weapon is equiped
[1:08:50] <%g0atmeal> I am so excited to see what kinda challenge runs you can do in this game
[1:08:51] <+valhallandoates> so much complaints from reviews but this game is everything i couldve asked for
[1:08:53] <%dekkitout> Where's mimic-chan

[1:09:14] <+kevlarkoala> @valhallandoates what reviews are you seeing? everyone is loving this
[1:09:19] <%hax_metatron> But you don‚Äôt have to
[1:09:32] <%g0atmeal> i've never seen such wholly positive reviews for a demo before tbh
[1:09:32] <%hax_metatron> You can keep your own scaling and still get the cool move
[1:09:35] <+FanServ> @valhallandoates there's like one review that complained
[1:09:37] <iacus_> afaik there are kicks with the unarmed moveset

[1:19:03] <Marvex> i love how his title is flying LUL. i like to think all the other dragons have some epic titles and agheel just got the participation title
[1:19:04] <+Shady_Zaku> Bait the fire breathing with horse, zoom in and slash neck
[1:19:05] <+AutechreTwinAphex> enemies knocking down trees and terrain is a huge QoL
[1:19:05] <+superchronicc> I can totally see a rathalos mod for this game in the future
[1:19:09] <%baka_sugoi> tick damage

[1:19:49] <+Shady_Zaku> Max did it first try with horse and a way worse weapon lol
[1:19:49] <BigFingerRo> Alright, I think it's been proven so far that this game FUCKS
[1:19:55] <Archmortal> this is the BABY area
[1:20:00] <+AutechreTwinAphex> the lighting already looks very good, if they do raytraced GI it's going to be sick
[1:20:04] <ExpressNode> So whats the story of the game or has it not been mentioned and its just straight gameplay?
[1:20:04] <%tusk102> @THATGUY_789 they vary between games
[1:20:07] <%hewlettfan96> Is this game a dark souls spin-off clone?
[1:20:15] <+Shady_Zaku> YEYEYE! bait the firebreath
[1:20:25] <+Shady_Zaku> zoom in and slash while he breathes
[1:20:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> does torrents damage stay after summoning?
[1:20:26] <%THATGUY_789> @tusk102 üëç
[1:20:26] <+ChaosVulpes> Fromsoft has two types of Dragons, fancy wyverns, and then the TRUE dragons that have four wings and stuff
[1:20:26] <lemon_lover28> that was cool
[1:20:27] <%tusk102> @hewlettfan96 this is made by the same company its basically dark souls 4
[1:20:29] <agustorm123> Jump the fire
[1:20:31] <dan_g_v> speed lines! So fast!

[1:20:44] <Archmortal> what if souls was wide instead of tall, and had a map
[1:20:46] <%RealThiele> yea the mounted damage is waaaay better
[1:20:47] <Jaysky> This seems like the proper way to fight him
[1:20:48] <T_Sasquatch> its literally just dark souls with improvements and open world
[1:20:57] <%THATGUY_789> @chaosvulpes good to know
[1:20:59] <%tusk102> @ChaosVulpes they also have normal wings four legged dragons like kalameet and sinh
[1:21:07] <%g0atmeal> I will probably map a single button to call torrent
[1:21:07] <Jaysky> @T_Sasquatch Good
[1:21:09] <cartakus> Fun fact while fighting this fucking lizard he bugged out and died on a cliff
[1:21:14] <%hewlettfan96> Fucking incredible moves
[1:21:16] <BigFingerRo> @T_Sasquatch and some lore changes, it sems
[1:21:20] <%SirGO0SE> I can't believe we have George R R Martin to thank for this Kappa
[1:21:22] <+AutechreTwinAphex> it makes the previous Soulsborne games feel like NES games in terms of scope and size
[1:21:24] <+sambws> This is def what I wanted DS3 to be
[1:21:25] <agustorm123> this dragon is kinda furry
[1:21:33] <SPidERMan8576> Gotta cut the tail
[1:21:34] <SaltyAzteca> IS THAT PHASE ONE PAT
[1:21:35] <%chance_h> I wonder how fast the Cinders mod team will be able to work on this when it comes out
[1:21:36] <%hewlettfan96> @t_sasquatch Wow couldn‚Äôt be any better
[1:21:37] <Archmortal> @cartakus ah, it really DOES have Dragon's Dogma in its DNA then
[1:21:37] <supergoblinpunch> Manscape his Drogonpubes
[1:21:45] <hucklberrytom> Can you cut off his tail?

[1:25:36] <cartakus> Still with the fucking endurance thing?
[1:25:38] <fjordicjordic> So I'm assuming Elden ring has a Anglo-saxon feel going for it so far? Seems like a post-Roman post-viking English setting?

[1:48:12] <+spartankzar> that little fucker has the thrall charge from DS3
[1:48:13] <%THATGUY_789> it's like people yelling at a movie
[1:48:13] <+ChaosVulpes> Funky little gargoyles
[1:48:20] <cartakus> Gagoylo
[1:48:21] <Grandma_Amari> This game is looking so good.
[1:48:22] <Calamity2007> Seems like lightning being OP is kind of a running theme in this setting
[1:48:29] <Shwepie> Adorable gargoyle gremlins.
[1:48:32] <Calamity2007> Granted I guess it was a thing every since Gwyn
[1:48:44] <agustorm123> Slay those gobos
[1:48:45] <%RaziWraith> Hold up. It doesn't cost materials to make those changes?
[1:48:49] <thestoreemporium> so... is this game good?
[1:48:56] <+Jack8274> @RaziWraith Bioe
[1:48:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RaziWraith nope
[1:48:58] <+Jack8274> Nope
[1:48:58] <cartakus> Nope
[1:48:59] <%TwistParabola> tiny gorgs
[1:48:59] <+spartankzar> yes
[1:49:01] <penitentpendant> @Calamity2007 Bonus points if the final boss is extra resistant to lightning
[1:49:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @thestoreemporium uep
[1:49:03] <nuane> @thestoreemporium no
[1:49:03] <Grandma_Amari> Rocks are resistant to electricity? Interdasting
[1:49:05] <%antpantz> nope
[1:49:05] <%RayReborne> Just lile that, observe, adapt, kick ass
[1:49:06] <grimwire1> wait lighting is not op as much anymore?
[1:49:13] <Shwepie> @RaziWraith Nope! Just free change at any Not-Bonfire‚Ñ¢
[1:49:15] <+FanServ> @thestoreemporium the concensus is yes
[1:49:15] <AngryPumpkin1995> nice
[1:49:18] <%tentavision> Pok√©mon!!!
[1:49:20] <%SirGO0SE> Pat sounds like he like it
[1:49:22] <agustorm123> Is Dark souls Remix 2.5
[1:49:26] <+Jack8274> @grimwire1 It scales with Faith now
[1:49:27] <%hax_metatron> @grimwire1 No those enemies have lightning resistance
[1:49:31] <thestoreemporium> @FanServ thanks!
[1:49:33] <cartakus> Kinda of a let down to be honest
[1:49:33] <%RaziWraith> Holy trucking shit! NotLikeThis
[1:49:36] <Calamity2007> @penitentpendant I mean we already know there is going to be a dragon boss that literally catches lightning bolts to attack you
[1:49:38] <iacus_> lmao
[1:49:41] <grimwire1> ah
[1:49:42] <+tactician0> no (lie)
[1:49:49] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> sword and board forever
[1:49:50] <+Cobaltor_252> damn the lighting in this room looks really good
[1:49:55] <+Dives__> fmgFINE
[1:50:01] <%PrimalDweeb> Teach those guys a lesson Pat.
[1:50:07] <SilverRoddo> SirShield
[1:50:08] <%Dakuu75> but your lightning sword won't do good damage unless you pump faith or w/e, right?
[1:50:09] <Jontman42> sounds like Bloodborne gems but more interesting
[1:50:11] <Solvari> mind goblin hideout
[1:50:12] <+wynnewake> burger king ass
[1:50:17] <+Dives__> Flame grilled whoppers for everyone
[1:50:20] <doster504> joking but are there any enemies in ds1 that are lightning resistant
[1:50:23] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> giant burg
[1:50:24] <dinnydanny777> This looks like a chalice dungeon
[1:50:24] <penitentpendant> @Calamity2007 Hopefully it gives the 'Lightning Stake' equivalent
[1:50:25] <%dekkitout> Oh
[1:50:25] <%TwistParabola> Oh, Flame
[1:50:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh, flame!
[1:50:27] <DracaenaLeaf> we all need it
[1:50:27] <%valriot> BECOME BRGER KING
[1:50:27] <+kevlarkoala> so I can finally learn the bosses weakness instead of looking it up
[1:50:28] <%SirGO0SE> Giant Burger Dad
[1:50:30] <Gray_LoFi> That is the best spell name
[1:50:31] <%RaziWraith> Burger King of the Tarnished!
[1:50:32] <Treasure_Vault> King Dad
[1:50:32] <cartakus> Oh, flane!
[1:50:34] <agustorm123> Can I giant Dad in this game?
[1:50:35] <Saltmeisterr> OH FLAME
[1:50:36] <Calamity2007> Regal Dad
[1:50:37] <President_Pariah> Is this actually Sneak King 2?
[1:50:38] <%UvBenServed> Huge Father
[1:50:38] <%MelBrooksKA> Burger dad
[1:50:41] <+Cobaltor_252> it's Giant Uncle now
[1:50:43] <%Bmrandfriends> looks like he can make flame grilled whoopers now
[1:50:43] <Dianaillumani> Is this commentary over his gameplay recording?
[1:50:43] <Khester824> Burger Dad
[1:50:44] <%hax_metatron> All incantations have names like that
[1:50:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> the fire effects look really nice too
[1:50:48] <+RandyFistburgers> Flame broiled
[1:50:52] <tolloponik> Gerger dad!
[1:50:54] <%antpantz> you can giant dad in the demo
[1:50:55] <%PrimalDweeb> Cool
[1:50:58] <%RayReborne> yay perma solved traps
[1:51:04] <Calamity2007> @dinnydanny777 I could see that, like there is going to probably be a lot of mini dungeons throughou the world
[1:51:07] <+NiktenKing> LEVIN SWORD!
[1:51:11] <cartakus> Taste the lightning sucka!
[1:51:12] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 no! you can, when you attach the lightning damage, choose if your weapon attack scales on faith or does your normal stats for damage
[1:51:15] <%g0atmeal> that might get nerfed
[1:51:15] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> :O
[1:51:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i love Oh, Flame! so much
[1:51:27] <+tactician0> just heal through it
[1:51:27] <dinnydanny777> @calamity2007 Yeah it's kind of cool
[1:51:29] <%PrimalDweeb> Yeah, lightning in this game actually seems worthwhile.
[1:51:30] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> does that buff boss health?
[1:51:33] <%Valdorick> Faith build Faith build!
[1:51:36] <Dr_Mooose> call in the squad
[1:51:40] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 you can also put the lightning SKILL on the weapon but not the lightning damage. so regular sword whose weapon art does a lightning strike
[1:51:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> Thanks Cinders for inventing that
[1:51:46] <Calamity2007> @dinnydanny777 As long as they aren't randomly generated I am fine
[1:51:48] <%TwistParabola> LUL
[1:51:48] <kinkade_77> is there pvp in this
[1:51:48] <%SirGO0SE> :O
[1:51:52] <nuane> I think weapon arts should use more FP, they look too spammable
[1:51:53] <+DuppyConQR> well we know now
[1:51:54] <Jontman42> wow Pat editing
[1:51:55] <%captain_thickthighs> is this live or pre-recorded Pat
[1:51:56] <+Cobaltor_252> :0
[1:51:58] <cartakus> I did not really die
[1:52:01] <Treasure_Vault> The flow of time is indeed convoluted
[1:52:01] <penitentpendant> Dog needed walkies probably
[1:52:01] <Saltmeisterr> :O
[1:52:05] <@SoFarFetched> @captain_thickthighs recording
[1:52:07] <+patel347> wow pat editing live,
[1:52:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> but coop!
[1:52:09] <+Cobaltor_252> @captain_thickthighs both
[1:52:10] <+kevlarkoala> so this is probably why they stayed on the DS3 engine, so they could work on fine tuning it rather than rebuilding it
[1:52:12] <+patel347> super human speed
[1:52:12] <%Dakuu75> @tusk102 so I could have a str build with a weapon that scales str but, the damage it does is an element?\
[1:52:13] <+Kiaayo> @captain_thickthighs he's just that good at editing
[1:52:14] <%g0atmeal> real-time pre-recorded
[1:52:17] <+Jack8274> What year are you in that you worry about internet like that?
[1:52:17] <socratitties00> Human players always just grief me Sadge
[1:52:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> always prefer coop
[1:52:19] <%SirGO0SE> damn hes good
[1:52:22] <cartakus> Yup fuck coop
[1:52:24] <+FingaLights> :O Is this Post Pat??? Just got her
[1:52:27] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 to my understanding yes
[1:52:27] <%chance_h> Pre-recorded video with a then postrecording prerecorded pat
[1:52:30] <Calamity2007> Real people ResidentSleeper
[1:52:32] <YakobMakel> That enemy looks so cool and weird
[1:52:35] <Shwepie> @Dakuu75 Yes.
[1:52:36] <+Jack8274> You wouldn't want your Dial up to drop when your mom picks up the phone...
[1:52:40] <@SoFarFetched> this is a record breaking stream Kappa
[1:52:44] <%captain_thickthighs> recorded Pat kind of sounds like a driving instructor
[1:52:47] <cuckholdberry_finn> REJECTION
[1:52:49] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 the elemental damage seems to do a raw number even if your faith is bad
[1:52:50] <%Dakuu75> @tusk102 @Shwepie that's fucking rad
[1:52:51] <%dekkitout> Aw!
[1:52:54] <%topendbuzza> is this pat a live pat or a post live pat?
[1:52:59] <%g0atmeal> it's the same as a youtube LP, he talks to nobody and uploads it all later
[1:53:04] <%hax_metatron> The lore on this sorcerer summon is HILARIOUS. It says he only managed to learn one spell in his life, and it trying his best with that spell LUL
[1:53:06] <Ipsenscastle> @captain_thickthighs a sexy driving instructor
[1:53:06] <cuckholdberry_finn> @topendbuzza post
[1:53:08] <cartakus> Recorded pat sounds sane
[1:53:08] <AngryPumpkin1995> recorded pat
[1:53:11] <Calamity2007> Is Tarkus a real player or NPC? An NPC so argument over
[1:53:12] <+FanServ> @topendbuzza neither, this is commentary at the same time as the gameplay
[1:53:17] <T_Sasquatch> this was the first place i want to unupgraded and no levels, his experience is so much different from mine
[1:53:19] <neraren> Apparently cant use them in the jail fight, so there ARE fights where you cant summon spirits
[1:53:20] <%g0atmeal> @hax_metatron Megumin LUL
[1:53:24] <%Bmrandfriends> So does that mean u cant play with others in the open world
[1:53:27] <%topendbuzza> so post live
[1:53:30] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 also again it means you can have your strength weapon just be a strength weapon that doesnt do elemental damage. but its weapon art shoots lightning
[1:53:30] <%Kevlar_Caviar> DAMN
[1:53:32] <%dekkitout> Cool
[1:53:35] <%scaryboisupreme> A door to the old labyrinth has opened
[1:53:36] <+NiktenKing> RAD
[1:53:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> cool
[1:53:48] <cartakus> Way too much FP
[1:53:53] <+FanServ> @Bmrandfriends no, you can
[1:53:53] <+covo375> A lot of things seem to have an FP cost with em
[1:53:55] <Profmcstevie> They're really stretching their legs on cool magic shit in Elden huh
[1:54:02] <+FanServ> @Bmrandfriends there's still pvp and summoning
[1:54:09] <SilverRoddo> Force points

[1:55:06] <Dr_Mooose> cat boss
[1:55:07] <%tentavision> HE'S A CAT?!?!?
[1:55:07] <ToneBacas> definitely one of the weirdest bosses i've seen
[1:55:08] <KamenWriter85> Mah! That weird cat is back
[1:55:09] <%hax_metatron> WHY IS THAT CAT CALLED WATCHDOG
[1:55:10] <ape_hawk> thats a cat
[1:55:10] <socratitties00> Wow the boys are not very good
[1:55:11] <%Kevlar_Caviar> JESUS CHRIST I HATE THAT
[1:55:11] <$realm_forge> KITTY
[1:55:14] <nuane> that jump animation
[1:55:14] <SPidERMan8576> The dance crew
[1:55:16] <Teras_ode> neko
[1:55:16] <%tusk102> THAT ANIMATION LOOKED BAD
[1:55:16] <dinnydanny777> It looks like a robot
[1:55:16] <%TwistParabola> spoooooky
[1:55:18] <cartakus> Lll
[1:55:19] <%Valdorick> CAIT SITH!?
[1:55:19] <+tsamxxx> amazing animations
[1:55:19] <%skizzuto> Why is he called a watchdog if he's a cat
[1:55:20] <tolloponik> Boss: R Kelly
[1:55:20] <dinnydanny777> Genuinely creepy
[1:55:22] <+Cobaltor_252> where the fuck is this cats animations
[1:55:23] <%greasypete00> this thing is somewhat unsettling
[1:55:24] <%Puhff> yeah pat u suck
[1:55:25] <Omentus> lmao this boss rules
[1:55:26] <%g0atmeal> 30s of aggroing the boss is incredibly good
[1:55:26] <%antpantz> he so cool
[1:55:30] <%MidnightBurst12> skull cat
[1:55:31] <SilverRoddo> Sphinx Meme cat?
[1:55:33] <fantom_flasch> This boss is so jank looking
[1:55:35] <cartakus> Yup
[1:55:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Chat you must have some weird ass cats
[1:55:38] <ToneBacas> that animation LUL
[1:55:39] <richmon__> jank af boss
[1:55:41] <%tusk102> THAT "JUMP" is so fuckin funny
[1:55:42] <%topendbuzza> he float
[1:55:44] <Parapattern> He go up and down
[1:55:45] <tengel66> hes the best thing ive seen
[1:55:46] <T_Sasquatch> its meant to be a statue thats why it animates like that
[1:55:48] <DracaenaLeaf> this boss looks jank with the animations
[1:55:49] <penitentpendant> The fact that summons distract bosses even for a moment makes them real useful. I suppose saving summons for Phase 2 will be a thing.
[1:55:50] <%Bmrandfriends> Its t-posing and floating away
[1:55:53] <+yoshkosh20> the way that thing moves bothers me.
[1:55:53] <%tusk102> @ReallyBigRocks looks like grandma the fuckin thing
[1:55:54] <tengel66> eerie
[1:55:55] <Shwepie> It's Caitsith.
[1:56:00] <%dekkitout> This fuck looks cursed
[1:56:01] <%TwistParabola> love how he moves
[1:56:01] <+Shady_Zaku> doodThirst doodGood doodGood doodGood
[1:56:01] <+LeosQuaint> it's kinda cute; reminds me of the Cheshire from Alice Returns.
[1:56:03] <cochramd1992> gottem
[1:56:03] <%scaryboisupreme> VERGIL TIME
[1:56:04] <%RayReborne> clap üëè üëè
[1:56:08] <iacus_> I love that they added low-budget boss
[1:56:08] <%g0atmeal> it's a statue, of course it looks jerky
[1:56:09] <Jontman42> it's supposed to look jank and weird, cause it's a statue
[1:56:10] <ShiningAxis> reminds of those good fortune cats that have their paw up
[1:56:14] <%PrimalDweeb> That sphinx was kinda creepy
[1:56:15] <%topendbuzza> neat
[1:56:17] <%MidnightBurst12> that death animation was oddly satisfying
[1:56:18] <+kevlarkoala> fromsoft has the best eye for design
[1:56:19] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> huh
[1:56:22] <+DuppyConQR> escape rope
[1:56:23] <@QueequegTheater> Remember, it's pronounced Kai She
[1:56:25] <cartakus> You forgot a item
[1:56:28] <SPidERMan8576> You defeated
[1:56:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> so I'm thinking like Sekirou, many named subbosses?
[1:56:36] <%tusk102> @iacus_ this build is guaranteed 3-6 months old
[1:56:36] <%hax_metatron> I love that they figured out a way to have authored chalice dungeon experiences, instead of randomized bullshit.
[1:56:40] <cartakus> Dammit pat
[1:57:00] <Dianaillumani> Yeah sick tatoo lady
[1:57:03] <@QueequegTheater> @Admiral_PopnFresh This makes me wonder whether DS2 or Sekiro has more bosses
[1:57:08] <SilverRoddo> Post-live Pat FBtouchdown
[1:57:14] <%Kevlar_Caviar> can we talk about how fucking horrifying that boss was?
[1:57:15] <%dekkitout> What's maaagic~ PridePog
[1:57:17] <iacus_> @iacus_ I bet it will be identical in the final game

[2:25:12] <definitelynotjayy> rune souls

[2:25:16] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:25:19] <WeepProphet> Souls
[2:25:23] <penitentpendant> @T_Sasquatch It's mostly the 'conventions' of most modern open worlds people hate. Formula wise.

[2:25:26] <%SirGO0SE> tbh dark souls was always open world i dont see the difference

[2:25:52] <%bruuzer12> @peachsaliva abysmal, I can't believe Pat put thus out. unsubbing and never watching again
[2:25:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> @QueequegTheater there was for a second earlier lol
[2:25:55] <Press_X_ToJASON> @t_sasquatch almost like most open world games are open world precisely so they can be filled with as little as possible, as opposed to this
[2:25:55] <kinetikpaws> this is a very enjoyable video yes
[2:25:57] <Skelex> @PatStaresAt In your opinion, does the open world nature make this game any more approachable for people who struggled with the difficulty of other souls games?
[2:25:58] <+fetrigon> @peachsaliva can this pat be the one we have on stream going forward?
[2:25:59] <Profmcstevie> Open World design from nothing tends to be gross, Open World variations of established concepts? ooh that's the good shit
[2:26:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PeachSaliva You only get to play Elden Ring once you beat the DS2 DLCs Kappa

[2:27:04] <+FanServ> @T_Sasquatch and those aren't the open world games people are sick of, so...
[2:27:06] <Jaysky> @Dakuu75 I'm cursed with the same. I feel like it's a challenge set up.
[2:27:06] <%The_Protagonist> The_Protagonist subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! A year of subbing and a bunch of years of following your content! Thanks for all the laughs, Pat. Give babbys pets for me!
[2:27:18] <penitentpendant> @T_Sasquatch You can guess who's been spamming the 'open world formula' into the ditch people want to burn
[2:27:28] <Klefth> UNfeasible
[2:27:28] <huskarl_zap> and then i killed the surrendering enemies
[2:27:33] <+kevlarkoala> I hope they give a lot of enemies that kind of character

[2:28:30] <+FingaLights> EAT CRAB EGGS
[2:28:33] <AngryPumpkin1995> It seems from watching that enemies are fairly diverse and interesting, wolves circling and backing off until they attack as a pack, enemies cowarding out and dogs blending in around them for psuedo ambush
[2:28:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Cloacussy
[2:28:36] <AngryPumpkin1995> I like it a lot

[2:33:26] <+Javaa01> @hax_metatron Chat was always pre-recorded
[2:33:26] <~PatStaresAt> Ill say this again later but I figured this'd also be a good test run for a format in case I get Elden Ring SUPER early. Cause fuck y'all I'm playing it but you'll still get that new LP smell
[2:33:29] <%JoshManVGH> Even chat was prerecorded
[2:33:29] <+inktoxicant> @savvytrue time to call on philosophy pat to guide us through the choppy waters of self-actualization

[2:38:01] <0rnan> I'm so happy the boss makes you respect his space.
[2:38:04] <@Lion_kun> man the checkpoint system is fantastic
[2:38:06] <@SoFarFetched> taking a shot everytime chat still backseats would kill everyone
[2:38:07] <0rnan> Delighted in fact.

[2:38:11] <+alphonseisbest> BIG AND STRONG
[2:38:12] <%OG_M_Bison> If Pat went electric element he would've won (I'll backseat even if it's prerecorded goddamit)
[2:38:12] <Naraki_Maul> YOU ARE RIGHT
[2:38:12] <1matheuw> the correct answer is to do an infinite amount of runs to try every single build possible
[2:38:12] <nuane> I love how they solved the problem of cheesing bosses by standing behind them by giving them hueg aoe on everything
[2:38:13] <TSBasilisk> Both on your last legs - turns out he doesn't skip leg day
[2:38:13] <ape_hawk> narrator: "he did not have it"

[2:38:18] <+inktoxicant> he got a foot, that's what he got
[2:38:20] <iacus_> no penalty for dying here I guess? no hollow/human status equivalent?

[2:38:21] <+NiktenKing> What Elden Rings you got
[2:38:22] <ExpressNode> @Marpolo13 Now I need to get a nvme drive because no one was kidding about the low space on the drives

[2:39:09] <Marpolo13> @ExpressNode yeah i figured they would release the low space version by default and the "better one" later, but at this point I don't see them even doing that
[2:39:10] <iacus_> if only he used summons
[2:39:12] <%blastyoboots> @QueequegTheater yeah but Oroboro has been streaming for like 10 hours
[2:39:13] <Profmcstevie> Oh god some of the chalice dungeon bosses in bloodborne would jump on your shit immediately, I want my blood echoes nerd back up

[2:39:56] <$Captainahab_37> hey everybody, anyone playing Pokemon: Kill God Edition
[2:39:59] <Hypnotoad0823> Glad to see Sneak King has gotten a rightful sequel.
[2:40:00] <%Alazull> You better be able to fucking joust with that motherfucker right there
[2:40:04] <lemon_lover28> something about the lance high attack at a large creature head felt very monster hunter
[2:40:05] <Marpolo13> @ExpressNode exactly
[2:40:06] <T_Sasquatch> @StaceMcGate Youre a garbage weapon
[2:40:11] <Ashecroft> The Lance seems to be best on mounted combat
[2:40:14] <$realm_forge> Pat and Paige should totally co op this
[2:40:16] <%tusk102> @StaceMcGate you seem like a grabage person /j
[2:40:16] <%greasypete00> did he just smack into the wall

[2:40:32] <cochramd1992> clutch
[2:40:32] <scarman125> @T_Sasquatch @TheButtravage I say worse because it feels like they just added a bunch of enemies in some places just for the sake of making it more difficult with seemingly zero care for whether they're well designed encounters or not.   add onto that is the glaring balance issues that have become apparent from trying to make a faith build not suck total ass and other strange choices that don't make much sense beyond just being spiteful like taking away the guaranteed drop of the Heide Knight S

[2:40:46] <+ChaosVulpes> Seems like a Faith build is going to be the way to go...
[2:40:47] <Ashecroft> Excuse me what
[2:40:49] <@Lion_kun> would have been good against the dragon
[2:40:50] <lemon_lover28> first try + hitless
[2:40:52] <%dekkitout> @Captainahab_37 I'll be playing that, this, and witch queen
[2:40:55] <kinetikpaws> that sounds like a woolie weapon
[2:40:55] <macathelo> what is a keytana?
[2:40:55] <1matheuw> kaytenna
[2:40:56] <StaceMcGate> you Lance stans are crazy, Lance-chan will never read your dms
[2:41:01] <%tusk102> @scarman125 you say that as if all of those problems werent present in the original
[2:41:05] <Jen_Spider> I'm assuming the dragonslayer isn't available in this section of the game?
[2:41:06] <+NiktenKing> A Japanese sword if you will
[2:41:06] <zerointelligence000> so how much of the map does the network test cover?
[2:41:11] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat how did recording in a setting like this again compare to the "weight of eyes" of a stream?
[2:41:14] <@QueequegTheater> @StaceMcGate >:(
[2:41:14] <%cooldude69xx> It's pronounced "Kay-TAN-ah"
[2:41:23] <%bevyrage> @StaceMcGate but what about dual lance POWERSTANCE
[2:41:29] <%Glass_Muffin> LETS GOOOOOOOOO
[2:41:31] <Hypnotoad0823> is that the same sound effect from DS1 when it shows an area name?
[2:41:34] <ExpressNode> @PatStaresAt You plan on getting this for PC or sticking with the PS5?
[2:41:34] <%xemnahort> @stacemcgate you shut up Lance-Chan loves me I know it
[2:41:36] <Blastotron> This game is gonna be hard for me to choose a build. Strength is better than ever, but magic looks WAY cooler and more useful now.
[2:41:37] <EternalJedi> cooldude69xx it's pronounced "swerd"
[2:41:40] <EternalJedi> limesGiggle
[2:41:40] <AngryPumpkin1995> It's a frozen weeb whacker?
[2:41:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @cooldude69xx Eh, tomato tomato
[2:41:52] <+CherteuseKapibara> just got here, is this pre-recorded pat?
[2:41:54] <T_Sasquatch> @scarman125 i though the sentiment of sots was that it was an improvement, thats unfortunate if you really dont like it
[2:41:55] <scarman125> @tusk102 the original had problems but SOTFS just amplified them all instead of actually making anything better.
[2:41:57] <oda_flobunaga> Its achully KAY-tam-uhh

[2:43:59] <+kevlarkoala> so do you guys think Elden Ring's dragons are drake's or are they legit dragons?

[2:45:30] <lemon_lover28> I thought the horse was mooing for a sec before Pat called out the bugle

[2:45:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> there's STILL more
[2:45:34] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if you can cut the chains
[2:45:35] <$floralkami> moo cow
[2:45:39] <scarman125> @QueequegTheater saying I'm wrong without trying to explain why doesn't do much to change my mind.

[2:46:26] <danknugglit> He stomp
[2:46:31] <@Jekado> STOMP COMBO
[2:46:34] <%tanarath> Pat should be jump attavcking
[2:46:37] <TSBasilisk> To be fair, they don't do much damage with the stomp, it's just the knockback effect
[2:46:38] <jumpyhugs> LUL maybe wait til you stop getting your shit stomped before you smack talk 'em Kapp
[2:46:39] <%tusk102> @arduousScavenger now criss cross!

[2:48:43] <toahmes> Did he say when this was recorded?
[2:48:46] <+inktoxicant> @thackattack00 elden bling is so good omg
[2:48:53] <+imadoc91> I enjoy this demanding past pat to do things
[2:48:54] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:48:54] <%smoothwood07> was that santa?
[2:48:59] <+twohitgood> i wonder if there's any kind of special upgrade types like twinkling or scale?
[2:49:00] <+kevlarkoala> oooh, so there are unique weapons then?
[2:49:01] <Louie_Salmon> Every single time I see "Limgrave", I can't help but think "Ligmagrave", the place where everyone goes to die of ligma
[2:49:04] <iacus_> yes
[2:49:04] <+imadoc91> He listens better than current Pat
[2:49:06] <+michingmallecho> Silverhand
[2:49:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @PatStaresAt Streamur, plz tell past you to do a better job. Thank you.
[2:49:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @toahmes last weekend
[2:49:17] <+michingmallecho> But...can you pet the horse though ?
[2:49:19] <@QueequegTheater> What are the odds we get legacy armor in the game like Solaire/Lucatiel/Anri's armor
[2:49:23] <%PatNTheHat> @Louie_Salmon Wait, who's Steve Jobs?
[2:49:24] <+kevlarkoala> you guys think that's a network test limitation or a real aspect of the game?
[2:49:28] <@QueequegTheater> Or at least knockoff versions
[2:49:31] <%Dakuu75> @Louie_Salmon lol, I hate that, that made me laugh
[2:49:33] <%PatNTheHat> @michingmallecho You cannot
[2:49:40] <%hax_metatron> Gotta love From's goofy animations man, make it feel so real
[2:49:41] <%dekkitout> Damn, boss weapons/spells must be flashy as hell
[2:49:52] <+michingmallecho> ....it's trash hasSmash
[2:50:07] <%tusk102> @QueequegTheater i wonder if the moonlight greatsword will be like old games where its basically see through or if itll be more solid/does some physical damage like ds3
[2:50:11] <+imadoc91> I like that the bosses seem to have unique loot instead of just soul drops
[2:50:11] <lemon_lover28> that skill doesn't seem nearly as good as the lightning
[2:50:11] <zangets1> how many bosses i can beat in the network test ?
[2:50:12] <%hax_metatron> It improves on upgrading the weapon
[2:50:15] <Louie_Salmon> @patnthehat Prince Steve of Jobs *lifebar appears*
[2:50:17] <StaceMcGate> bad weapon lol
[2:50:18] <%hax_metatron> I beat the boss by upgrading this weapon and using that art
[2:50:19] <+JustToWatch> how do you powerstance?
[2:50:34] <SilverFaustX> game could use more music
[2:50:41] <ralphfromdk> does any one know how you get more flasks this time aroun?
[2:50:44] <+inktoxicant> how much does he do per swing pat?
[2:50:44] <%hax_metatron> Just equip two of the same type of weapno, and you automaticqlly powerstance
[2:50:49] <%hax_metatron> Can be the same class of weapon too
[2:50:50] <huskarl_zap> like swinging at a doll
[2:50:54] <%tusk102> @SilverFaustX it has ambient music all the time and this isnt a boss
[2:50:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @SilverFaustX perhaps he has it turned down?
[2:50:55] <%tanarath> Do the red one
[2:50:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[2:51:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i can't believe the upgraded one does more damage
[2:51:07] <+michingmallecho> So cool
[2:51:11] <Louie_Salmon> @justtowatch Basically same as DS2, you do the input for 2Hing the left weapon with both equipped
[2:51:14] <NimbusArchon> Is stamina just... way easier in this game
[2:51:14] <SilverFaustX> hm
[2:51:14] <@SoFarFetched> demotest
[2:51:16] <zangets1> how many bosses i can beat in the network test ?
[2:51:18] <iacus_> doesn't matter. demo is fine
[2:51:20] <+imadoc91> I'm hoping it is a mix of BB MLG sword and DS3
[2:51:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh, I hear it.
[2:51:28] <fragdar> still pre-recorded or live now?
[2:51:35] <tolloponik> 55 un-upgraded compared to 63 on a plus 3 is nuts
[2:51:35] <@SoFarFetched> prerecorded still
[2:51:36] <%hax_metatron> @zangets1 10
[2:51:37] <%PatNTheHat> @Louie_Salmon It would be really funny to see an encounter like that
[2:51:37] <%tusk102> @zangets1 like 8
[2:51:38] <%blastyoboots> really need the Burger King on top of that set for full Giant Dad
[2:51:40] <@Lion_kun> Can you transfer that spinning weapon art?
[2:51:40] <SilverFaustX> nier spoiled me with music
[2:51:42] <%JoshManVGH> Why is that phrasing so important to the company?
[2:51:44] <fragdar> ok, thanks
[2:51:44] <thebehatted> I think that's the armor set from that one knight standing next to the sitting lady in that one trailer
[2:51:46] <+FanServ> @fragdar it is all prerecorded
[2:51:47] <1matheuw> lol
[2:51:49] <%tusk102> @fragdar still pre recorded no footage of elden ring will be live
[2:51:56] <NimbusArchon> It is clearly also a demo though
[2:51:57] <+imadoc91> that's what I'm saying blast
[2:52:02] <%MechArch> damn this set looks sick
[2:52:03] <+imadoc91> this is definitely new Giant dad
[2:52:05] <+kevlarkoala> @iacus_ might be an "requirement from studio" distinction

[2:52:38] <+inktoxicant> GIMME YOUR POOP
[2:52:38] <%tusk102> please put "prerecorded footage" in the name of the stream or smth jesus
[2:52:42] <sublimedeer> he didnt notice the poise

[2:53:15] <+imadoc91> us*
[2:53:15] <@SoFarFetched> @tusk102 bold of you to assume chat can read Kappa
[2:53:17] <+LeosQuaint> I just got back, that's some dope armor
[2:53:22] <penitentpendant> Now that I think about it, Bonus Points if that Weapon Arts cancels backstab animations because they're hit by the sword spin.
[2:53:24] <+buttdirt> those are fast projectiles, even for a souls game
[2:53:30] <%TigerCatGo> Become SERPENT
[2:53:31] <%JoshManVGH> Projectiles are so much faster in this!
[2:53:34] <%tusk102> @Press_X_ToJASON i know but people keep coming in and asking
[2:53:42] <lurkerletum> Wait shit school got me out of the loop. Did Elden Ring already release? I thought that was next year.
[2:53:43] <scarman125> the guard counter is so fucking sweet
[2:53:45] <+imadoc91> actually how do I know you guys are real?
[2:53:50] <%dekkitout> Out of the blast, into the tunnel
[2:53:51] <supergoblinpunch> That counter is so strong
[2:53:56] <@SoFarFetched> @tusk102 even if pat put it in as the stream title,people still don't read the title at times LUL
[2:53:57] <%tusk102> @SoFarFetched legally blind chat
[2:53:57] <+Daoshinto> q: do we know if left handing a sword or etc. would mirror the right-handed moveset or does it change the attack into a block like some of the previous games? paragraphs, shrug.

[2:54:07] <TSBasilisk> @lurkerletum This is the Network test - not until Feb. '22
[2:54:11] <@SoFarFetched> as Ive DEFINITELY experienced chat not reading the title or details below.
[2:54:12] <ape_hawk> put it into your dick
[2:54:12] <AngryPumpkin1995> @imadoc91 You don't because we aren't :)
[2:54:19] <+inktoxicant> I'm glad I'm not the only person who cycles through menus when I'm trying to decide on a stat point
[2:54:20] <StaceMcGate> existence is pre-recorded
[2:54:21] <lemon_lover28> @lurkerletum this is a network test, it comes out at the end of February
[2:54:26] <+imadoc91> actually not even joking I am legally blind tusk
[2:54:29] <%tusk102> psaBlind chat 90% of the time
[2:54:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lurkerletum this is a network test, some content creators got access early, others will get in later today
[2:54:35] <lurkerletum> Aaa I see thanks everyone for the clarification.
[2:54:42] <%JoshManVGH> @lurkerletum They let some influencers play early as part of a big promotional thing. And it may not just be them...
[2:54:43] <Hypnotoad0823> what the hell does the Death attribute do on the character stat screen?
[2:54:52] <danknugglit> Life is pre recorded
[2:54:56] <Louie_Salmon> @daoshinto left-handing swords seems to finally work how you would want, but right handing a shield still makes it swing instead of block.
[2:54:56] <+kevlarkoala> @inktoxicant i usually tab over the the reddit post i was following lol

[2:59:47] <+imadoc91> Vaati played the whole demo with it didn't he?
[2:59:47] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:59:50] <%tusk102> god if you want a str/fth build in this you only need to level 3 stats, vigor, strength, and faith
[2:59:50] <%BoxNavy> we can make grease fires
[2:59:55] <%BoxNavy> is that the same thing?
[2:59:55] <+Cobaltor_252> man twinblades were my shit in DS2 I'm so excited to see them back
[2:59:59] <scarman125> how are faith builds in Elden Ring? I haven't actually seen anybody talking about them.
[3:00:06] <+cubbywolf> grease fire was my nickname in highschool
[3:00:17] <+imadoc91> Someone else I was watching didn't two hand it and went "Well this thing's bad."
[3:00:17] <%RayReborne> @t_sasquatch hold triangle, hit right triggers for right hand left triggers for left hand
[3:00:20] <%GinAndRoses> quick what class of fire extinguisher should you use for a grease fire
[3:00:24] <loukemia83> Crafting is going to do away with all my "Using items" on boss mind goblins I hope
[3:00:26] <@QueequegTheater> @Cobaltor_252 I hope they just give us the Red Iron
[3:00:26] <+imadoc91> Its like goddamn two hand it
[3:00:27] <+covo375> Will players actually use consumables now that you can craft them?
[3:00:30] <%BlackMage66652> Grease fire is the name of my dick
[3:00:30] <Jaysky> @scarman125 Nobody had enough faith in it to try it, it seems
[3:00:36] <@Lion_kun> @tusk102 There is so much more variety in builds, it's great.
[3:00:36] <+imadoc91> they're not good with one hand
[3:00:37] <%tusk102> @scarman125 i havent seen any but they are apparently good and also apparenyl pyromancy scales with faith now so miracle people are also pyros
[3:00:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @GinAndRoses water duh :)
[3:00:42] <@QueequegTheater> @covo375 no, I might need it later
[3:00:44] <+derpumpkinking> @scarman125 Real nutty. can do some obscene things with the early faith spells

[3:01:13] <+cubbywolf> that makes sense
[3:01:14] <ElPlasa> I love that Str is the equipement cap stat, I always found it dumb that str builds had to level up 2 stats in order to use their stuff
[3:01:14] <@GeneralSCPatton> John Beastman!? sweetc2Excited
[3:01:14] <+jimmiepyle> whats up with the cut tho. did pat show his pp?
[3:01:14] <%tusk102> @tusk102 dex int is apparently even better now since dex apparently actually does effect cast speed
[3:01:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat must've gotten so owned he's ashamed
[3:01:18] <%BlackMage66652> Wait this isn't live?
[3:01:19] <+cubbywolf> wow what a bitch cut LUL

[3:01:30] <tolloponik> Murdered so hard he wasn‚Äôt even worth the edit time
[3:01:33] <+FanServ> oh my god how are people still not aware this is prerecorded
[3:01:35] <dude_bruhh> did chuck norris fast forward the stream?
[3:01:38] <%TwistParabola> that's Crazy Talk accelerating time
[3:01:38] <%Dakuu75> ok... i'm kinda glad they brought back the stupid ghost-emote-inputs from bloodborne lol
[3:01:39] <%tusk102> @ExpressNode pat played it for about 18 hours
[3:01:39] <%hax_metatron> It's a replenishable custom flask
[3:01:42] <$realm_forge> OH SHIT PAT KILLED IT SO FAST WE TIME TRAVELED

[3:01:51] <@QueequegTheater> @Hypnotoad0823 No, Pat has obtained Emperor Crimson.  He is specifically using the dub name to mess with Woolie.
[3:01:51] <%BoxNavy> margrit
[3:01:52] <%antpantz> MARGERIT

[3:01:58] <Press_X_ToJASON> @fanserv pat viewers can‚Äôt read, not a joke
[3:01:58] <+DrHentaiPhD> Lmao has it been pre recorded all along?
[3:01:58] <%tusk102> @ExpressNode i think it was a "this day to this day" thing rather than specifica hours you get to play
[3:01:59] <oda_flobunaga> Magrat Garlick
[3:02:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat did it he finally got time stop
[3:02:06] <+ultimntpenguin> He erased the fight and skipped past it
[3:02:06] <+EySoyCoco> hollow attache case
[3:02:10] <@SoFarFetched> @cubbywolf You can show a video while live
[3:02:13] <cochramd1992> he completely forgot the summon LUL
[3:02:14] <senfood> Greasy boys making noise.
[3:02:22] <+cubbywolf> where does it say pre recorded?
[3:02:22] <+fetrigon> @fanserv it's streaming. people leave and enter the stream at any time
[3:02:22] <+FanServ> @DrHentaiPhD yes
[3:02:23] <@SoFarFetched> He pretty much is just having this video play
[3:02:29] <+cubbywolf> yeah thats fine

[3:02:33] <scarman125> wait can you just fast travel to the boss fog?
[3:02:34] <+inktoxicant> I'm gonna have like three days to take in the new destiny expansion before this just takes all of my free time forever
[3:02:34] <penitentpendant> @cochramd1992 Good use of crazy talk
[3:02:38] <zerointelligence000> TARKUS
[3:02:40] <SIydoc> @PatStaresAt how are you playing right now? arent the servers down still?
[3:02:42] <+imadoc91> There is something weirdly dissonant about watching a let's play on Twitch
[3:02:42] <%Dakuu75> Elden ring estus is tomato juice now~
[3:02:46] <Marpolo13> lol
[3:02:51] <+FanServ> @fetrigon i mean it's crazy because it's been said every 30 seconds in chat at some point
[3:02:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> guys...fromsoft themselves said nobody is allowed to do live gameplay of the network test, all footage you see from anyone is pre-recorded
[3:02:58] <%Rumbutt> CHUG THAT WATER PAT
[3:03:02] <%tusk102> @Dakuu75 just wiped out tomato town
[3:03:05] <+imadoc91> well
[3:03:06] <+cubbywolf> i mean, once you know the test is down it makes sense whats going on
[3:03:16] <+RemedyofRevenge> oh no my friend just went down
[3:03:17] <+inktoxicant> that hammer is sick
[3:03:17] <danknugglit> Im really enjoying past pats commentary :)
[3:03:21] <+imadoc91> I saw quite a few livestreams on youtube earlier
[3:03:23] <kinkade_77> seems like summons will be pretty much useless for real bosses
[3:03:24] <lemon_lover28> charge attack ducked under his attack. Nice hitbox
[3:03:25] <ExpressNode> The boys of broken poise
[3:03:26] <+FanServ> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ that's not true for the test this morning or the one coming up, it was only for the test last weekend
[3:03:29] <huskarl_zap> the final area of elden ring is tomato town
[3:03:34] <+imadoc91> including Mordecai IIRC
[3:03:34] <arduousScavenger> Warrior blood must run in your veins, POTTER.
[3:03:35] <scarman125> hey who wants to bet that this set won't be in that carriage come launch day.
[3:03:36] <%tusk102> he kinda reminds me of manus just bc of his weird gross tail and the staff
[3:03:43] <%dekkitout> Get spicy
[3:03:45] <CrowbarFacelift> I just realized that voice actor is Anthony Howell (Call of Cthulhu, Vampyr, etc.)
[3:03:47] <%antpantz> SHINY
[3:03:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> still greased tho
[3:03:49] <ambig_anti> caught greasing in 4k

[3:04:10] <andiwaffles> I did like Sekiro but I can't lie that I'm more excited for another souls game
[3:04:11] <+imadoc91> That's what happens when you don't give Mordecai an Early access code
[3:04:13] <%hax_metatron> NUH UH YOU DIDN'T WIN
[3:04:14] <ambig_anti> crendorMonkaBugs
[3:04:15] <+cubbywolf> that man is greasing in the bushes watch him!

[3:04:30] <danknugglit> The bloodborne

[3:04:32] <%BoxNavy> what did he mean by this?
[3:04:33] <+fetrigon> @fanserv it's Friday. And this is really popular content. So the flow of people is gonna be much more than normal.
[3:04:33] <@Lion_kun> goes to show that if you're struggling, doing other things and buffing your power goes a long way
[3:04:35] <Darthkitten_Prime> Wow what an easy boss, can't believe they're going baby mode so game journalists can play
[3:04:36] <@SoFarFetched> TOUCH GRACE

[3:06:07] <%dekkitout> Look forwards to glycerin only runs
[3:06:10] <+imadoc91> At least strength being the equip load stat is gonna stop people from stacking havels and using a falchion to R1 Spam.
[3:06:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> yo any seals in chat?
[3:06:10] <@Lion_kun> it seems the other stats aren't as useful. Like why would you ever put points in Arcnae?
[3:06:11] <%TigerCatGo> My cats appreciate the call-out
[3:06:11] <+rheviel> seals
[3:06:17] <nuane> force of habut

[3:06:58] <Piiavc> Gilbert?!?!
[3:06:59] <%dekkitout> Sure thing, Not-Patches
[3:07:00] <%tank7013> I bet the first grace was to keep people from warping back to stock up instead of moving on to find that one
[3:07:00] <lazylazzer> 6 feet vs 5'11 right here
[3:07:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> this dude is all fucked
[3:07:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> kill him
[3:07:06] <+inktoxicant> Cor blimey mate, that main gate is mighty chuffed
[3:07:06] <penitentpendant> I wonder if there'll be unique dialogue by walking past him toward the hole
[3:07:06] <DXLelouch24> chat thats not patches, we wont see Patches comin
[3:07:07] <$realm_forge> this guy is clearly vegan

[3:07:21] <loukemia83> look at the NECK on this guy
[3:07:21] <%tusk102> @dekkitout dude patches is probably just gonna be in the game for real

[3:07:26] <+ChaosVulpes> Hi there you Patches looking mofo
[3:07:28] <+imadoc91> hardened*
[3:07:30] <Hypnotoad0823> kinda sounds like Wallace
[3:07:33] <+inktoxicant> giraffe man
[3:07:35] <VladVandal> moon2JAM
[3:07:41] <penitentpendant> @DXLelouch24 And thus, the Patches bloodline will continue~
[3:07:44] <danknugglit> That npc outta little nightmares
[3:07:45] <%tusk102> i doubt this is patches only because i assume patches is literally just gonna show up on like a goat or something like in bloodborne
[3:07:49] <%dekkitout> No doubt actual Patches will be in
[3:07:49] <Dr_Mooose> monkaS
[3:07:50] <%TigerCatGo> HEH HEH HHEH I remember this

[3:37:55] <@Lion_kun> THIS GAME LOOKS SO GOOD
[3:37:55] <olaksi> doesn't prove anything, chat is very predictable
[3:37:56] <heartlesshealer> [You are speaking to a hologram]
[3:37:58] <TangyDeliciousness> is this part prerecorded?
[3:37:59] <Dr_Mooose> what about soft cape?
[3:38:00] <+ALazo> video was live, chat was prerecorded
[3:38:03] <+cvp5127> @PatStaresAt did you use a script?

[3:38:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[3:38:32] <@ssjklyco> Gief writes the scripts
[3:38:32] <Darkfire346> using a script is basically reading but talking
[3:38:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> What is that extra sound that happens when you swing your sword sometimes?
[3:38:34] <CrowbarFacelift> Paige holds the cards
[3:38:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt how old do you think the build you were playing is
[3:38:35] <OldManDeckardCain> pat obama?

[3:39:10] <%Shirousuke1989> So who's Elden and why do we want his Ring?
[3:39:11] <%SirGO0SE> D:
[3:39:11] <MusouMiko> you pretended we were here and it tricked like 500 people
[3:39:12] <Medo3G> Using the old LP chops
[3:39:13] <@Spydurman> whussy
[3:39:14] <%Mister_McDerp> imaginary chat LUL
[3:39:14] <%Dakuu75> lol

[3:39:15] <%afronooch> so you pretended we werent there then
[3:39:16] <$realm_forge> Pat slaps words on to his orb like when you press silly putty into newspaper
[3:39:16] <CrowbarFacelift> now wait just a minute
[3:39:16] <%Rumbutt> without the funny ass shit we say too
[3:39:17] <kiiiirsten> D:
[3:39:17] <%SaiyanShoto> A lot of people I watch don't use scripts either, using a script makes it feel fake sometimes
[3:39:18] <Ranger747> LUL
[3:39:19] <%RayReborne> Love you too Pat Kappa
[3:39:20] <AngryAsian5> So you did a let's play

[3:39:22] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:39:22] <%furiousfurioso> we are dumb it's true
[3:39:23] <kiiiirsten> you love chat

[3:39:28] <%Bt_Robot> Peepee Poopoo?
[3:39:28] <%Dakuu75> LOL stfu chat! XD
[3:39:30] <%dekkitout> No "Yes, indeed" yet
[3:39:31] <+kapcommunist> thats the way TB did it nyannSadge
[3:39:33] <+imadoc91> I think we could all tell it was improved the second you made the prolapse Joke Pat...
[3:39:33] <oda_flobunaga> Its nice and soft and silky
[3:39:33] <%JoshManVGH> You can't escape our stupid annoying shit!
[3:39:37] <penitentpendant> Can't marry your Waifu without a good ring
[3:39:39] <kiiiirsten> Perfect
[3:39:43] <+imadoc91> improv-ed*
[3:39:43] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt how old do you think the network test build is?
[3:39:44] <+OotsyMahDootsie> @PatStaresAt Does poise work like it did in DS1?
[3:39:45] <@Spydurman> GRRM hasn't written it yet
[3:39:45] <+ofblueair> Chat is never annoying Kappa
[3:39:47] <%chance_h> Chat is a toxic bog, ignoring us is always a good idea
[3:39:50] <%SirGO0SE> so 85% of peoples first play through
[3:39:51] <lonosis47> Yes
[3:39:51] <guffbud> What were the 3 other bosses??
[3:39:52] <olaksi> how are you pat
[3:39:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> if thats not the first area and you jave to do a lot without the jorse or melina that'd suck
[3:39:55] <+ArCielArDor> is there equipment degradation
[3:39:56] <%SaiyanShoto> I played Dark Souls and I still don't entirely know what the flame is
[3:39:59] <oda_flobunaga> TBH, DS2 without its opening cutscene would be better
[3:39:59] <+Grayhammatter> months i'd say
[3:40:02] <%ThirdWelles> Where did Mr. Boivin go?
[3:40:03] <twistedj3ster> Do we get a Pat of our own to narrate our adventure when we buy the game?
[3:40:05] <iosephe> 1 month probably
[3:40:06] <gfuelstimshot> whats your favorite color? @PatStaresAt
[3:40:08] <%NeoCre> You also never bothered to read the item descriptions
[3:40:09] <OuijaTears> Can I go pee now
[3:40:10] <@Lion_kun> Have you tried all the classes?
[3:40:11] <%UvBenServed> Is THIS part prerecorded?
[3:40:11] <%Dakuu75> sounds right
[3:40:11] <+NiktenKing> probably
[3:40:12] <scarman125> @PatStaresAt is the thunderbolt like a Nameless King thunderbolt or a lightning spear?
[3:40:13] <@SoFarFetched> Chat still needed to backseat the pre-recorded footage,or else they'd lose their ability to backseat live streams Kappa
[3:40:13] <%tusk102> lmao
[3:40:13] <%RayReborne> if not 3 months old
[3:40:15] <Tarkara> Did you put a lot into HP or do you naturally gain more HP than in other Souls?
[3:40:16] <sio_pao2001> o√≤oh elden ring
[3:40:17] <Medo3G> That's consistent with From NTs
[3:40:17] <lonosis47> Is it Botw souls
[3:40:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> GIMME GIMME
[3:40:25] <Darkfire346> how long do you think itll last before hackers attack ppl?
[3:40:27] <sadboy_otoroshi> Chat's input is very important for the gameplay Kappa
[3:40:34] <%hax_metatron> Do you think there's more mechanics they're hiding not in this network test?
[3:40:36] <saddlezilla1> @PatStaresAt how big would u say the portion u played is compared to BotW's map?
[3:40:42] <+fetrigon> @patstaresat When will business pat be next appearing on stream?
[3:40:43] <$realm_forge> GRRM is spending his time writing Lotr length descriptions of floppy wieners
[3:40:43] <%bevyrage> i got a very important question: do you already feel the itch to hop back in and play it some more?
[3:40:44] <%ElkRiverDog> I'm afraid I got here late; will this video go up on youtube?
[3:40:45] <ralphfromdk> @PatStaresAt Have you tried a block-counter with a  spear/shield combo?
[3:40:48] <olaksi> backseating prerecorded footage is just good practice
[3:40:48] <%JoshManVGH> Does the sound prompt for Guard Counter happen to tell you to press the button, or BECAUSE you pressed the button? @patstaresat
[3:40:49] <MusouMiko> that claw miracle *shreds* margaret
[3:40:51] <loukemia83> @patstaresat Is it a concern that this is a REALLY polished area for publicity and the rest may be less dense?
[3:40:52] <%chance_h> @SoFarFetched true, we weren't awful enough. Should have backseated more
[3:40:53] <%topendbuzza> but what if you do tho?
[3:40:54] <phantompain00snake> did you get the dragonscale blade?
[3:40:55] <%barrakuta371> Does the PS5 controller's haptic do anything unique?
[3:40:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> What was that noise your sword made sometimes?
[3:40:57] <+RandyFistburgers> Not even one tiny iota?
[3:40:57] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> But what if you did though
[3:40:58] <moonmintparadise> i want to thoooo it looks great
[3:40:59] <Khester824> you start with a broken sword
[3:41:00] <%hax_metatron> Do you think there's more mechanics they're hiding that are not in this network test?
[3:41:01] <+CapnClassix> Is this gonna be the first area of the game
[3:41:03] <+twohitgood> it's way too nice to start with that. you most likely start off with heal or small heal.
[3:41:07] <%dekkitout> Hopefully you'll be better off spell wise than Blodborne starting you with a phat 0
[3:41:10] <%RayReborne> Those starting equipment sets also all seem like they'll need to be found/bought
[3:41:10] <+nicoleymcquack> is the difficulty the same as other souls games or is that hard to gage with the limited gameplay you‚Äôve experienced?
[3:41:12] <Medo3G> I bet that sorcerer lady isn't behind pumpkin head cause she doesn't even care
[3:41:12] <SuperChumps> @PatStaresAt Given the ability to swap this title with Bloodborne 2 and have it release on the same date- would you make that swap?
[3:41:14] <gyrogrey> is there any haptic feedback or is just standard vibration?
[3:41:15] <Tarkara> How do the stats feel? Did you put a lot into HP, your health bar was massive for level 22
[3:41:16] <penitentpendant> Makes sense, you have more recovery and windup frames
[3:41:19] <%RealThiele> big number
[3:41:25] <Smokin_Fish> Yo Pat I think you're cool
[3:41:27] <kiiiirsten> poise for big bois
[3:41:27] <%Bt_Robot> Could you cut off Margit's tail?
[3:41:28] <sadboy_otoroshi> @PatStaresAt Can you dodge in place with jumping? How jumping affects the gameplay?
[3:41:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> maybe
[3:41:42] <%RealThiele> no luck 0/10
[3:41:46] <saddlezilla1> What issues do you see the final game having?
[3:41:46] <+RosieOneHalf> Do you think there might be tail weapons in this one?
[3:41:48] <%tusk102> juiced to make you feel big and strong
[3:41:52] <%RayReborne> yeah hmm
[3:41:53] <AngryPumpkin1995> How have you found the hitboxes?
[3:41:57] <+imadoc91> I hope that FUGS is in, a FUGS block counter would be so Dirty
[3:41:59] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt were you able to try the Katana a bit, how was it?
[3:42:00] <%MugenSandan> Is blocking with a two handed weapon still mostly useless
[3:42:02] <%JoshManVGH> All stats are lies this time around!
[3:42:03] <Gelphaze> How many status effects are there, or what have you seen?
[3:42:07] <Darkfire346> what did you think of Giant Mom Waifu?
[3:42:11] <%hax_metatron> Do you think there's more mechanics they're hiding that are not in this network test?
[3:42:16] <%Dakuu75> oof
[3:42:19] <%tusk102> rip
[3:42:21] <Maleicus> how did you mix those up
[3:42:23] <SuperChumps> @PatStaresAt Given the ability to swap this title with Bloodborne 2 and have it release on the same date- would you make that swap?
[3:42:24] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> A scim-tana
[3:42:25] <%xemnahort> Was there a lvl cap?
[3:42:26] <%RealThiele> Skimitar
[3:42:27] <Witchtaker> Do you know if Briars of Sin scales with FTH like the the description implies in spite of being a sorcery?
[3:42:29] <%chance_h> scimatar
[3:42:32] <ralphfromdk> Does Stamina seem to last you longer than previous Souls games?
[3:42:32] <%bravebravesrobin> was Patches there at all?
[3:42:32] <%dekkitout> Puh-terodactyl
[3:42:33] <%AgniBrandt> I'd like to signal boost another question I saw: Do they do anything with the PS5 haptics?
[3:42:33] <%tusk102> are  you ready for the vergil cosplays with summon swords
[3:42:35] <%Mister_McDerp> I love skimitars
[3:42:37] <%PatNTheHat> Number 1 thing you think needs to be added?
[3:42:37] <+lupinlazlo> what next on the schedule
[3:42:39] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt do you think they'll make any changes based on feedback or data from the test?
[3:42:41] <penitentpendant> I don't think there's a hub?
[3:42:41] <%JoshManVGH> Does the Guard Counter sound happen before or after you press R1?
[3:42:44] <T_Sasquatch> Is there even a hub
[3:42:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I kinda don't think there even is a hub
[3:42:47] <%antpantz> whats A hub?
[3:42:49] <lonosis47> Theres a hub?
[3:42:49] <+imadoc91> Werewolf transformation is absolutely a thing seeing that wolf guy in the trailer
[3:42:49] <%Dakuu75> Sin-my-tar-tar
[3:42:51] <%hax_metatron> Something about a round table
[3:42:51] <+cvp5127> what hub
[3:42:54] <+CherteuseKapibara> guns
[3:42:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> theres a hub
[3:42:56] <saddlezilla1> Think the final game will let you summon bosses?
[3:42:57] <SIydoc> so is poise not a thing or is it just a hidden stat now?
[3:42:57] <oda_flobunaga> the rest of the map?
[3:43:00] <Darkfire346> more cubes
[3:43:00] <Gelphaze> Curs weapons!
[3:43:01] <+NiktenKing> the hub is after the next couple areas
[3:43:01] <@Spydurman> mecha
[3:43:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> it was mentioned
[3:43:03] <%topendbuzza> guns
[3:43:03] <+ArCielArDor> boob
[3:43:03] <%RayReborne> Wonder what the Hub would even be needed for tbh
[3:43:04] <kiiiirsten> BIG thinking

[3:43:07] <penitentpendant> Patches (The Character)?
[3:43:08] <+nicoleymcquack> does the difficulty match up to previous souls games?
[3:43:08] <%TwistParabola> we've lost him
[3:43:08] <@SoFarFetched> lemme actually put this chat in slow mode so questions can be seen easier
[3:43:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt do the haptics do anything
[3:43:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Can't emote at the level up lady 0/10 game
[3:43:11] <+OotsyMahDootsie> did u talk about poise?
[3:43:12] <%chance_h> A multiplayer lobby would be cool in a bad way
[3:43:12] <MusouMiko> armored core obviously
[3:43:14] <%hax_metatron> BB weapons
[3:43:15] <%PatNTheHat> List too big or it that good?
[3:43:15] <+eanscrale> I would not be surprised if world tendency is back and somehow even more esoteric and confusing
[3:43:17] <+sewermonk> Maiden Feet
[3:43:22] <guffbud> How weird will it be to not have a jump in dark souls now ?

[3:43:40] <+NiktenKing> it's not made for PS5 specifically chat
[3:43:41] <%SuckerPunchSyd> What was that sound effect that happened when you swung your sword?
[3:43:42] <saddlezilla1> Yeah, they said in interviews there'll be a hub, but u don't start there or return for upgrades.

[3:43:50] <DXLelouch24> do you think there will be convenant equivalents?
[3:43:51] <DynzelWashington> I think I missed it, what's the difference between INT and ARC?
[3:44:00] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt no weapon arts ever/
[3:44:06] <%tusk102> @DynzelWashington arc is luck
[3:44:09] <Hydrapissed> Beast CLAW OWNS
[3:44:10] <%RealThiele> int seems like FP,
[3:44:11] <+OotsyMahDootsie> @DynzelWashington Arcane looks to be the new Luck stat
[3:44:18] <%Bt_Robot> Did it look like enemies have limb damage like Bloodborne?
[3:44:19] <DynzelWashington> Ty
[3:44:21] <%JoshManVGH> Is the Guard Counter sound an audio que or a confirmation noise?
[3:44:27] <penitentpendant> Looks like Weapons Arts were juiced
[3:44:39] <+imadoc91> The wolves apparently absolutely fuck up the horse boss
[3:44:42] <%chance_h> A lot of the older soulsborne games tend to punish magics, so this game seems better combat wise
[3:44:52] <%cooldude69xx> I have a bad question
[3:44:53] <Hydrapissed> @PatStaresAt did u ponder ur orb today?

[3:45:08] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Does Elmo prefer a Strength or Dex build?
[3:45:08] <%PatNTheHat> With weapon elements being so easily swapped, do you see resistances and weaknesses playing a larger role than in previous games?
[3:45:09] <atomicdestruction> Is poise working?
[3:45:10] <penitentpendant> @chance_h Minus some bosses have literal magic counters
[3:45:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Wait is that what that sound is when the sword gets swung? A guard counter?
[3:45:17] <%antpantz> sugoiSadguts
[3:45:19] <AngryPumpkin1995> Did you see much in the way of bullshit hitboxes on any attacks?
[3:45:19] <+DrFacilier> game need be in hand now
[3:45:20] <KaiserMario> I was surprised you were having so much trouble with Chipp Za-Lion, he just got Blood-Starved moveset
[3:45:22] <@ssjklyco> The substitute teacher you called in smelled of booze.
[3:45:24] <$realm_forge> I really want to make that sword and armor set

[3:46:01] <%chance_h> Nyanners and pat co-op stream when?
[3:46:01] <ralphfromdk> @PatStaresAt Does stamina get you way further, or is it just juiced stats you think?
[3:46:02] <penitentpendant> "Good question." Walks away.
[3:46:03] <saddlezilla1> @PatStaresAt do u think there's a chance 1 or 2 trick weapons might end uo in the game?

[3:46:52] <@ssjklyco> Does jump have iframes?
[3:46:52] <+NiktenKing> you can crouch and jump over attacks
[3:46:54] <ExpressNode> A VTuber I think
[3:46:54] <Kivuro42> Peeve had a loop that he talked over and played some some slips when they were relevant
[3:46:58] <%RayReborne> Sweep jumping sekiro style Kappa
[3:46:58] <%Bmrandfriends> is poison as bad as dark souls
[3:47:00] <@Spydurman> will you and Nyanners play multiplayer when it comes out?

[3:50:29] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Powerful words
[3:50:30] <Archmortal> you know what the Souls recipe needed for me?  It needed what Elden Ring is doing.  I'm kinda just done with wide hallways and vertical level layering
[3:50:35] <%shurtal> it's dark souls three, now with lime
[3:50:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> Play a different game dude
[3:50:44] <SaltyAzteca> I says what I says, I says its good

[3:50:50] <ToneBacas> i can see that
[3:50:52] <azure_dunes> that sounds cool as fuck
[3:50:53] <GarbageNirvana> Basically if you were never into the Dark Souls type games this doesn't look like it's gonna do anything to change your mind
[3:50:53] <lonosis47> The jump air pads are not awesome
[3:50:55] <@Jekado> Pat Dark Souls most of the maps had a lot of what i think you said "shortcut porn" i was wondering since the game is open world do we lose that in this game?  Does it feel like the world or level feels less unique that way?
[3:50:56] <%G_Thunders> @patstaresat Do you think there will be a mid-game story twist like Bloodborne‚Äôs cosmic shit and aliens?

[3:51:12] <T_Sasquatch> open world poision swamps. fucking ew
[3:51:13] <sonicblade38> 3.......thats soul crushing
[3:51:13] <SaltyAzteca> no, two poison, one toxic
[3:51:14] <GarbageNirvana> Which like...I've never been able to break that barrier myself, unfortunately
[3:51:14] <%RayReborne> ONLY three? Kappa
[3:51:15] <+DrFacilier> i hope so
[3:51:17] <+NiktenKing> Please no Blighttown
[3:51:18] <%dekkitout> Blightcon Prime, Blightcon South, Blightcon London
[3:51:19] <%topendbuzza> sure hope so
[3:51:20] <MusouMiko> gonna be one point where the poison swamp feeds out into a Biggerer Poisonerer Swamp
[3:51:20] <RogueMinja> I'd be shocked if there was a remade Bed of Chaos somewhere in this game.
[3:51:22] <skeletonkingofmanlets> @G_Thunders something about "the night"
[3:51:24] <%notsoy> god i hope not, poison swamps are fucking shit forever
[3:51:24] <%antpantz> def gonna be some alien shit
[3:51:25] <+sewermonk> A lot of things seem to have Horns bursting out?
[3:51:25] <+CherteuseKapibara> the map turns upside down like castlevania

[3:51:30] <%SaiyanShoto> I hate the poison swamps psaFist
[3:51:30] <Archmortal> is Elden Ring easy mode Dark Souls because it has a map
[3:51:31] <AngryPumpkin1995> 4 poison swaps and a blight-metropolitan area
[3:51:36] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:51:36] <lonosis47> saying Elden ring is boring because it feels the same as the last 3 fromsoftware games is valid critcicsm
[3:51:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> At least 2
[3:51:41] <+DrFacilier> Entire map on fire

[3:51:56] <penitentpendant> Flat planet flying through the universe
[3:51:56] <%JoshManVGH> This shit aliens?

[3:52:08] <%delilah4you> And then they put de master chief in de soda
[3:52:10] <+nicoleymcquack> i‚Äôm honestly excited because it looks like they‚Äôve taken a bit from all the games to make ULTIMATE DARK SOULS
[3:52:10] <ToneBacas> imagine you wake up from the Animus and it was all a Templars' Illuminati plot
[3:52:12] <%JoshManVGH> Planet!?
[3:52:12] <MusouMiko> elden ring of symphonia
[3:52:13] <%codedoomboy> Like the moonlight great sword
[3:52:14] <+punchdrunk_donkeybooy> Elden Ring turns into Armored Core?
[3:52:15] <%Bt_Robot> So there might be a little Conan in this
[3:52:15] <DynzelWashington> It's actually a BD in Cyberpunk.
[3:52:17] <%PatNTheHat> What the fuck do you think is up with the big glowey tree?
[3:52:17] <Dr_Mooose> huh
[3:52:18] <penitentpendant> Most of the ruins seem to be indicating they FELL to where they landed

[3:52:22] <+imadoc91> Martin is obsessed with Lovecraft and so is Miyazaki
[3:52:23] <enkaisu> that sounds insane and i love it
[3:52:23] <fragdar> elden ring is bloodborne 2
[3:52:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Do weapons feel any different from other soul type games or in the same wheelhouse?
[3:52:30] <%cooldude69xx> @sniffy77 God I hope so
[3:52:31] <Profmcstevie> and then ARMORED CORE ROBOTS come in
[3:52:31] <Teras_ode> dark souls becomes a studio trigger anime Kappa
[3:52:31] <cheesefriend03> @PatStaresAt Kitao said in a stream today that the item description in the CNT and the full game will be different.
[3:52:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Will there be a Moonlight Greatsword?
[3:52:35] <%antpantz> sugoiWoah
[3:52:36] <saddlezilla1> @PatStaresAt Any weird predictions: Mine is I think Melina's the actual main character & this is her story.
[3:52:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> @lonosis47 i know what you mean, but weren't the last 3 fromsoft games Bloodborne, ds3, and Sekiro?
[3:52:37] <%EmanXLR> EmanXLR subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[3:52:37] <nuane> and its an armored core
[3:52:37] <Gorgs7> Patches kicks you off the planet, and you fall down
[3:52:38] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[3:52:38] <+cvp5127> patches is a planet
[3:52:39] <+twohitgood> that would be awesome.
[3:52:40] <@Ranryu692> Mecha Sif Chaos
[3:52:41] <sendart> we can only hope
[3:52:44] <GemeSvev> I hope patches kicks me off the earth
[3:52:45] <MusouMiko> armored core battle with patches sounds p legit yea
[3:52:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if WE ar the Moonlight Greatsword?
[3:52:47] <%Alazull> Then Eight Ball shows up
[3:52:50] <heartlesshealer> Patches will kick you back down to the starting planet as soon as you try to climb the tree to the bigger one
[3:52:51] <moonmintparadise> oh no its armored core now
[3:52:51] <%vivaldiva> and he kicks you off the planet
[3:52:55] <Cicit0ny2730> metal wolf chaos?
[3:52:56] <akitanito> I want this is be a stealth armored core sequel
[3:52:57] <%delilah4you> How much do you think is reused animations?
[3:52:58] <%JoshManVGH> Do we get to fly Jehuty there?!
[3:53:04] <enkaisu> that sounds like the original premise of Dragon's Dogma, kinda
[3:53:09] <Parapattern> The planet is the top of Patches' bald head
[3:53:09] <+NiktenKing> Metal Soul of the Blood of the Wolf Chaos
[3:53:10] <%G_Thunders> Yeah GRRM‚Äôs world is highly Lovecraft outside of main story areas in game of thrones
[3:53:11] <arkv01> @Profmcstevie YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GlitchCat
[3:53:11] <+cvp5127> what did George do?
[3:53:16] <penitentpendant> The One Ring, TO RULE THEM ALL
[3:53:16] <cochramd1992> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:53:17] <+ThighsSupreme> Wasn‚Äôt their something like that in the leaks like that early this year with the moon
[3:53:20] <KaiserMario> George's best idea was to do the opposite
[3:53:20] <T_Sasquatch> i feel like george is there as marketing
[3:53:23] <%Ynkubus_> The transition point to mech stuff is just bridged by shadow tower
[3:53:23] <%strakillias> strakillias subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! Hey Pat, This week noticed some barely noticeable burn in on my LG C9 tv. I've had it since May 2019, have screen shift, and have been using it as my computer monitor for 10+ hours a day. This TV is great, I'm surprised it took this long for burn in.
[3:53:24] <+twohitgood> it's still around because it works?
[3:53:25] <%PatNTheHat> Maybe it'll turn out the true Elden Ring was the friends we killed along the way
[3:53:26] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if the ring isn't important and it's all a dream?
[3:53:27] <%OG_M_Bison> Maybe Elden Ring is actually a Halo ring Kappa
[3:53:28] <%Alazull> Yeah, it's Norse mythology
[3:53:29] <%SirGO0SE> GRRM is only writing the description on the back of the box
[3:53:30] <moonmintparadise> well thats rather simplifying it very very hard
[3:53:30] <guffbud> Did you do much sneaking or was it mostly ignored ?
[3:53:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> WHAT IF ACTUALLY A RING WORLD?
[3:53:31] <ralphfromdk> @PatStaresAt How awesome is it that Strength raises equipload? It's awesome, right? :D
[3:53:32] <%sniffy77> Is the elden ring confirmed to actually be a ring
[3:53:33] <OldCrow11> idk, pretty sure it was mostly a marketing thing
[3:53:35] <%delilah4you> The Elden Ring is just the Halo
[3:53:35] <%hax_metatron> Watch the Elden Ring not be an actual ring, but like ... a concept
[3:53:37] <+Grayhammatter> ghost pat
[3:53:37] <skeletonkingofmanlets> GRRM just wanted to call us MAIDENLESS
[3:53:38] <DynzelWashington> He ripped everything else from Tolkien
[3:53:39] <tolloponik> But it‚Äôs broken now~
[3:53:45] <+nicoleymcquack> That pat? he‚Äôs dead now
[3:53:46] <%TigerCatGo> TRICKED
[3:53:49] <%G_Thunders> The Elden Ring is a star gate
[3:53:49] <MarlooRedd> GRR Martin was slumming it
[3:53:51] <penitentpendant> "Future Proofing"
[3:53:52] <%topendbuzza> psaBougie psaBougie
[3:53:53] <@SoFarFetched> SoFarFetched subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! This isn't Elden Ring talk but I've caught up on the MSQ for FF14 this morning! All I have left now is doing the other stuff in Shadowbringers like the Alliance Raids,Bozja quest,etc. Feels weird seeing the "To be continued..." finally on the top corner.
[3:53:53] <+michingmallecho> He was busy finishing  the books‚Ä¶ LUL LUL
[3:53:53] <akitanito> yeah but your face
[3:53:54] <lonosis47> @OneThousandTomatoes yes and Elden ring has things from sekiro, bloodborne and especially ds3
[3:53:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Also because he was naked during the recorded footage
[3:53:58] <heartlesshealer> yeah, probably be good to have left it camera-less if only for HUD elements
[3:53:58] <@Spydurman> did GRRM literally do anything? Has anything been confirmed as his writing?
[3:54:00] <%ThirdWelles> Speaking of "Mister Pat," is Mr. Boivin gonna be back in class on Monday?
[3:54:00] <arkv01> dude what if the elden ring is actually a HALO
[3:54:01] <%antpantz> the orb man
[3:54:04] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Fair
[3:54:05] <+alphonseisbest> yup
[3:54:06] <%afronooch> fuck em, show off that mug
[3:54:06] <Medo3G> They probably hate that you're talking as well
[3:54:07] <twistedj3ster> and confused by Steve
[3:54:07] <%justcallmebobplease> BUT WHAT IF IT WAS A MEME FACE
[3:54:08] <Profmcstevie> HES BLOCKING THE RUNE COUNTER, GODAMMIT
[3:54:08] <sio_pao2001> i think it might have been better if they did the story themselves
[3:54:09] <+Daoshinto> makes sense
[3:54:09] <%barrakuta371> Pat is bottom left
[3:54:11] <KaiserMario> Why is your hair grossly assymetrical today?
[3:54:11] <@TheYellowcouch> Fuck them kids
[3:54:13] <saddlezilla1> @PatStaresAt The meetings between GRRM & Miyazaki must've been them fanboying over Miura & Tolkien aggressively.
[3:54:13] <%bravebravesrobin> well deal with it pussies
[3:54:14] <Rionxgarland> you usually dont care thou
[3:54:14] <akitanito> at least put your eye in for brand
[3:54:18] <%Rumbutt> You should've done the whole thing in big Pat mode
[3:54:18] <+NiktenKing> LUL
[3:54:20] <nuane> I genuinely thing miazaki had dinner with martin once and the marketing team just made it a thing
[3:54:20] <iosephe> very sensible
[3:54:21] <%blistexthief> Come for the Elden Ring, stay for the pepperonis
[3:54:22] <+bearman414> PAT DA PROFFESIONAL
[3:54:25] <+Grayhammatter> show me potato salad
[3:54:27] <jonblnt> Pat do you have a neuromod on the right side of your head
[3:54:27] <%Alazull> Pat got that Mentat look going
[3:54:28] <+imadoc91> Just like how the audience that came for the Elden Ring Footage want the really bad prolapse joke right>
[3:54:28] <%RayReborne> exactly, i was urked by maxes face covering the menus in his footage
[3:54:29] <%dekkitout> But the algorithm says-
[3:54:29] <%TigerCatGo> SHEEEEEEETT
[3:54:32] <penitentpendant> @Spydurman If there's incest in any of the backstory, we'll know where he's been
[3:54:34] <+cvp5127> you should put yourself in the middle out of spite
[3:54:35] <Megadragoonx> @PatStaresAt When can we expect "Pat revisits Omikron" to go live
[3:54:39] <@SoFarFetched> yup

[3:55:04] <penitentpendant> Wow, Nostalgia has grown strong
[3:55:04] <+ParryLurr> stop lookling at me
[3:55:05] <+imadoc91> That's a fucking pull for a reboot

[3:55:07] <%delilah4you> nope new episodes
[3:55:07] <$StrawberryPantsu> Continuation
[3:55:07] <@Ranryu692> no, it's picking up where they left off

[3:55:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> same vas right?
[3:55:12] <%dekkitout> No clue
[3:55:14] <%cade_calrayn> It's probably a continuation
[3:55:16] <+NiktenKing> @sirgo0se lol
[3:55:16] <$realm_forge> That‚Äôs the patpuff
[3:55:18] <%KetsuoTaberu> KetsuoTaberu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! <3
[3:55:19] <@Ranryu692> the X-Men cartoon was cancelled in 97
[3:55:20] <%Alazull> No, the animation will be twice as embarassing
[3:55:21] <%Dakuu75> JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAN~!
[3:55:22] <GarbageNirvana> So are they getting all the same VAs then
[3:55:22] <%SaiyanShoto> it's continuing where it left off

[3:55:39] <%delilah4you> *JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!*
[3:55:39] <+cvp5127> will jubilee still be lame
[3:55:42] <%TigerCatGo> BIPBOPBIBIDOO
[3:55:42] <@Ranryu692> They announced it using the Wolverine caressing the photo meme
[3:55:45] <GarbageNirvana> Also does that mean we're possibly getting MvC4
[3:55:54] <%Emperor_Machinus> oh no baby Pats!
[3:55:54] <+Opal_Overture> How long has the stream been going? Just got back from class?
[3:55:58] <SocialMisfitGamer> no mean to be a downer, but it's gonna be kinda weird due to cyclops old va passing away
[3:56:14] <Profmcstevie> Knights in armour who can jump, weird muscle memory
[3:56:15] <BigFingerRo> Uhhhhhh Mr. Boivin? Mr. Pasta Rat lets us rip phat bapes in class, can we do it?
[3:56:18] <Daniel_Is_I> The guard counter feels more organically integrated.
[3:56:21] <%delilah4you> @cvp5127 Does a mall babe eat chili fries?
[3:56:39] <%SaiyanShoto> That sounds like it can be stressful
[3:56:41] <+nicoleymcquack> i forgot to grapple in sekiro for so long because i jumped back into it after beating ds3
[3:56:45] <@Ranryu692> you had it count up rather than setting a timer?
[3:56:48] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I wish we coulda been with you live for Elden ring but, thanks for the video anyway, my dude.
[3:56:50] <%JoshManVGH> Sneaking was featured a lot in the trailer, did you find any fun sneaking tools in your time playing?
[3:56:54] <%greasypete00> greasypete00 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! This game is oozing GRRM names and theming so ig its obvious where all his work went into for the people wondering
[3:56:54] <+cubbywolf> years content. feeeeed meeeee
[3:56:59] <@TheYellowcouch> thanks dad
[3:57:04] <%OG_M_Bison> @cvp5127 Do mall babes still exist?
[3:57:08] <%PatNTheHat> And we appreciate it.I am so thirsty for Elden Ring
[3:57:12] <%hax_metatron> Godric the Golden is 100% a GRRM name
[3:57:16] <%ThirdWelles> Is this one of the games you're gonna be keeping for alone time when it releases, or do you plan on running the whole game on stream?
[3:57:31] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[3:57:31] <heartlesshealer> makes sense
[3:57:32] <T_Sasquatch> wait what
[3:57:35] <%afronooch> fair
[3:57:36] <%JoshManVGH> Woo
[3:57:38] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:57:39] <guffbud> Did the monkey appear in the cave again or were you unable to play any more after this ?
[3:57:41] <+cubbywolf> cucked
[3:57:43] <%antpantz> hggFeelspiccoloman
[3:57:45] <Icedlightning> BibleThump
[3:57:45] <@Lion_kun> you did it the best way you could
[3:57:45] <%RayReborne> stream 4 minutes of it Kappa
[3:57:46] <+cvp5127> sure pat
[3:57:47] <%Alazull> Just make yourself frustrated
[3:57:50] <Medo3G> you have 8 minutes
[3:57:50] <%G_Thunders> @patstaresat fun fact: if you stagger one of the giants pulling the carriage, the other one gets pissed at him and they fight each other
[3:57:51] <%dekkitout> As someone willing to admit I've never read any of his material, that sounds good to hear from someone who knows
[3:57:57] <%TigerCatGo> SO AGRESSIVE
[3:58:00] <Daniel_Is_I> Man not satisfied with all the riches of heaven
[3:58:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe Woolie will do it in ten years or so, he's very excited about it you see
[3:58:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> oof
[3:58:06] <@Lion_kun> I hope they're still not there in the retail version.
[3:58:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> But anyone can get the network test, that's like... third party or something
[3:58:08] <%Alazull> Oh that would be infuriating
[3:58:11] <Rionxgarland> oh god
[3:58:12] <%hax_metatron> Dark Souls 2
[3:58:15] <heartlesshealer> oh man
[3:58:15] <OldCrow11> LUL
[3:58:16] <%RayReborne> @g_thunders no way what
[3:58:32] <Rionxgarland> thats evil
[3:58:37] <%G_Thunders> @rayreborne yeah I saw it on max‚Äôs stream this morning
[3:58:38] <%SaiyanShoto> I saw that you might not even be allowed to stream the network test but people are doing it anyway LUL LUL
[3:58:39] <%RayReborne> yeah they're VERY jaggy lol
[3:58:42] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, that's awful
[3:58:44] <+nicoleymcquack> not to simp but you‚Äôre lt the only streamer i was gonna watch play the tester, you‚Äôre the reason i even tried souls games way back
[3:58:44] <%JoshManVGH> Sneaking was featured a lot in the trailer, did you find any fun sneaking tools in your time playing?
[3:58:46] <+Cobaltor_252> man I fucking love that goofy game development shit
[3:58:47] <%ThirdWelles> sounds more "sharp" to me haha
[3:58:52] <%ThirdWelles> end me
[3:58:53] <+imadoc91> This game is like Dark souls 2 with a budget
[3:58:57] <%RayReborne> @g_thunders damn thats sick
[3:59:11] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:59:14] <+imadoc91> and like competent management
[3:59:20] <%BoxNavy> is it a cool windows 98 screensaved
[3:59:21] <%BoxNavy> er
[3:59:32] <%PatNTheHat> Since you can't think of anything you'd like to see added, what about features that you think should be removed/significantly tweaked?
[3:59:34] <%afronooch> they live with us ???
[3:59:39] <+Grayhammatter> BAHNING!
[3:59:47] <+imadoc91> What about Health Bars? Won't they burn in?
[3:59:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> didnt Linus do a vid on that
[3:59:53] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:59:57] <+ParryLurr> at the cost of the overall lifespan of the tv
[4:00:03] <Woombaleano> Psa man i know this is the big souls4 time but could you tell me why there 100 msqs between ARR and heavensward in ffxiv?
[4:00:07] <%BoxNavy> dude its so weird
[4:00:09] <@SoFarFetched> IT IS
[4:00:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah its weird the first time
[4:00:27] <+Cobaltor_252> @PatStaresAt don't you use some software that lets the screensaver kick in on one screen and not the other? I vaguely remember you and Woolie bringing it up on the podcast
[4:00:29] <@SoFarFetched> its weird now realizing "oh Im caught up"
[4:00:33] <%ThirdWelles> I've left it on so I don't have to check if I have Job quests
[4:00:36] <+imadoc91> I've hear about people having issues with HP bars and hud elements burning in
[4:00:37] <%Alazull> Yeah dude you'll come around to thinking of it as weird when it doesn't say To Be Continued...
[4:00:37] <@TheYellowcouch> it was fun seeing that thing disapear for the first time
