[0:04:27] <puddingpants88> apparently pickle juice isngood for weight loss
[0:04:27] <Piemen99> queston. what do the pickle long swords look like?
[0:04:28] <%Dingus_Tickler> Only game with a good Platinum is Bloodborne since all you have to do is beat the Main Game + Chalice Dungeons. And 1 or 2 side pieces that are given to you at the end of the game LUL
[0:04:28] <%spacedroner1> More subspecies pls
[0:04:29] <+superc37> wens knack
[0:04:30] <+Bupkis7> enbSwoleL NEED MORE MONSTERS enbSwoleR
[0:04:33] <Mr_LupLup> Normally the canadian time is 6 hours in the past for me, but is it now 5? Daylight savings change over there or something?
[0:04:38] <JinTheMedic95> the return of the Murder pickle!!!
[0:04:42] <CaptainSharkFace> What rank you gotsa be for deviljho? Is it over HR14?
[0:04:50] <~AngriestPat> Nah, he shws up in 6stars
[0:04:50] <shinzireael> but the real monster is man. didn't you hear?
[0:04:51] <KTDelgado> isnt deviljo tomorrow?
[0:04:52] <GrayMatterMiner> probably
[0:05:01] <~AngriestPat> He's the ground counterpoint to bagel
[0:05:10] <CaptainSharkFace> Good. I'm still only HR14...
[0:05:12] <EmptyFist> I never noticed that Paige has an iv connecting her to the mustard in this art.
[0:05:13] <+mr_zombiefetish> theres a new tab called " special assignments" but its greyed out
[0:05:13] <sovietkitty92> Good ol B-52
[0:05:13] <Psyramics> deviljho is releasing tomorrow GMT time
[0:05:16] <%spacedroner1> So now we have angry sky pineapple and angry pickle, great
[0:05:19] <ShoggothLord> I randomly test the Twitch app now that I have a smartphone, only to find Pat about to stream? Good timing.
[0:05:19] <CaptainSharkFace> Not much time to play. ;-;
[0:05:19] <JinTheMedic95> I can't wait to see him fight b 52
[0:05:24] <%Dingus_Tickler> Deviljho is the only monster that rivals Pat’s girth
[0:05:36] <%SergentSov> Even Deviljho can't match it though
[0:05:36] <puddingpants88> @angriestpat if I jump into MHW now am i going to be all alone or is there still a community for newbies?
[0:05:38] <DasFreekman> ive been getting shit on for decos.
[0:05:42] <BaronVonWolfe> I'm trying so hard not to be a pushy Warframe fanboy...but WHEN'S WAHRFRAME!?
[0:05:44] <RedMaskBandit> cant be late to your stream if youre early and take a break
[0:05:44] <~AngriestPat> There's a billion newbies pants

[0:06:21] <Theophilus567> I believe it comes out at 7 central time
[0:06:21] <soliammurr> oh boy early morning stream for me folks!
[0:06:23] <%Dingus_Tickler> @puddingpants88 I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more people whose first MH is World, than Vets, on PS4 and Xbox
[0:06:26] <Theophilus567> So 5 minutes
[0:06:28] <KTDelgado> oh wtf
[0:06:29] <Mr_LupLup> Some people seem to have lost the concept of time zones
[0:06:35] <BaronVonWolfe> Seriously though, I hope Pickleis cool.
[0:06:40] <Farples> yeah, drops today due to it going live based on japan time
[0:06:40] <GrayMatterMiner> never fought deviljho, apparently he's a fuck
[0:06:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> Time Zones are hard
[0:06:45] <%Railstone> Ive been meaning to learn charge blade, which are the better ones after this patch? I know the stronger one is getting nerfed
[0:06:47] <Janzer247> peepee
[0:06:48] <GrayMatterMiner> we shall see
[0:06:50] <%spacedroner1> Time zones are dumb
[0:06:51] <sovietkitty92> WHO'S READY FOR THE PICKLE?
[0:06:58] <KwakuAnansi> @GrayMatterMiner Yep
[0:07:03] <$coffeeabomination> yesssssssd
[0:07:04] <AngryPhant0m> woooo mhw
[0:07:06] <%SergentSov> No one is actually ready. People think they are.
[0:07:10] <Frog_of_Justic> Dont worry about being new people are always willing to help on MHW
[0:07:12] <WildSevens> lol
[0:07:15] <puddingpants88> havent had such panicked battle fun since the sega CD
[0:07:16] <%Dingus_Tickler> @railstone Charged Blade isn’t getting nerfed. It’s more of an adjustment. Nothing detrimental
[0:07:16] <Stormo> Are there any things I should know before I take on Deviljho as a bow user?
[0:07:16] <SirBlakeAJSA> IMMA FIGHT A PICKLE AND A BAGEL ALL AT ONCE
[0:07:24] <GrayMatterMiner> yknow, apparently twitch audio and soundcloud dont fight
[0:07:25] <CaptainSharkFace> What's ol jho weak to?
[0:07:26] <%Jesseplaysz> apatSkelmo apatSkelmo
[0:07:26] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I completely forgot about those timezones. PICKLE FROM THE FUTURE INBOUND...

[0:07:34] <KwakuAnansi> Dragon and Thunder
[0:07:35] <%Jesseplaysz> apatSkelmo apatOrange apatElmo apatSkelmoney
[0:07:39] <Theophilus567> @railstone nah the weapons themselves aren’t getting nerfed. The super amped discharge is getting nerfed a little
[0:07:41] <GrayMatterMiner> listening to the podcast with the music here
[0:07:42] <Mr_LupLup> @Stormo Dont get eaten
[0:07:42] <bit_guardian> Evening everyone
[0:07:45] <chocobodundee> @Stormo he likes to back step and he has sweeping beams
[0:07:46] <%Dingus_Tickler> Put the Pickle inside the Bagel and eat it SoonerLater
[0:07:47] <CaptainSharkFace> @kwakuanansi thank!

[0:09:23] <ShoggothLord> What's this super chill track that's looping?
[0:09:27] <%Dingus_Tickler> I wish Capcom would allow Female Hunters to wear the Male Commission Set, because the Female Comission Set SUCKS

[0:27:41] <T_SHAFE> WHAT?
[0:27:41] <+TsunamiPoro> BLOODBORNE DOES REQUIRE REFLEXES
[0:27:42] <+Loyks> nani
[0:27:43] <+rarvikar> how does bloodborne not need fast reflexes
[0:27:44] <umbypokochan> Undertale battles are basically Atari games
[0:27:44] <Buteman> ???
[0:27:47] <sayaman012341> SHOTS
[0:27:48] <%WorldSoup5> apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat

[0:27:53] <lord_souls> @Smyter that's a spoiler
[0:27:54] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's not REQUIRED.
[0:27:54] <%PunishedRaccoon> not really
[0:27:54] <%Remery_> It doesn't if you build yourself like a truck
[0:27:55] <+Bhpicasso1> Paige vs that final boss on genocide LUL

[0:28:00] <cherrycottontail> bloodborn doesn't require any semblance of skill
[0:28:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> Did you guys watch Paige go through Bloodborne? She tanked through it
[0:28:05] <+Rinoka> @rarvikar it doesn't require the level of finalboss reflexes tbh
[0:28:11] <grayjammer> Weird Sexy Mollusc Robots

[0:28:21] <+rarvikar> Pat what's one piece of advice for tempered Kirin solo
[0:28:27] <+OranHexthief> @JingKaisean if you really need someone to help you out either type in the region chat asking for some help or try talking to some people in a random queue. most people in the warframe community are very willing to help new players
[0:28:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> She used her chin to break through the enemies garrison
[0:28:27] <PsychedelicSnake> @AngriestPat Geoff, the Art Director of Warframe, says Warframe's weird design is intended to be a bit polarizing. Kind of like how something being memorable is better than it being forgettable.
[0:28:29] <Solidus_113> YEAAAAAAAA

[0:30:25] <+Valison> Apparently the only requirement for jho is killing pink rathian
[0:30:28] <Polengoldur> @bruno_silv0 it has to be that way. theres no story, so if u could build everything right away the game would be boring in like 2 weeks

[0:31:15] <$GohanEgret> and just like that pat is back in super hard
[0:31:15] <%Macbutters86> that's so weird
[0:31:18] <Worldbrand> I thought dark souls invented the best friends, back when warframe created it in 1467
[0:31:20] <$Bonkasaurusrex> @AngriestPat Do your fucking optional quests
[0:31:20] <+ItsAGundamu> @AngriestPat Hes in some mushroom gathering quest
[0:31:23] <%SergentSov> Anywhere that isn't an arena quest?
[0:31:27] <%President_Miyazaki> Maybe you need to see him during a Hunt?
[0:31:31] <Greywyn00> you have to encounter him first, just like with all the other monsters
[0:31:31] <%spacedroner1> I think he's in 7 star because I used to have his quests
[0:31:32] <+Rinoka> @AngriestPat find him in another quest
[0:31:32] <Shishi1205> @AngriestPat He's just a bazel 2 so just random choice
[0:31:33] <Sunstalker> @AngriestPat Any thoughts of doing a let's play for the new God of War since you'll be able to treat it like the Last of Us except shitting on both main characters? Kappa
[0:31:33] <+mechokk> is it like mh3u where hes part of a quest?
[0:31:35] <Inferno_Icon> Probly need to track in expedition
[0:31:37] <+Demon_Shadow4> why would you paly through obs the lag is shit!
[0:31:37] <%Intersceptre> You may well have to kill/capture before a quest appears
[0:31:38] <Zebroneath> It's probably one of those, "Find tracks while doing stuff" kind o fthing.
[0:31:39] <AzureDusk> Deviljho is inside you all along
[0:31:39] <+Revets315> so what's Jho's weaknesses
[0:31:40] <sayaman012341> E X P E D I T I O N S B O I I Z

[0:31:49] <bambowl> FINISH YOUR QUESTS BOI
[0:31:49] <+Armeggadon> @AngriestPat I believe that before you get the actual pickle fight, you have to encounter him in the wild
[0:31:51] <Farples> @angriestpat you probably have to go out and sight him on one of the maps first
[0:31:53] <%SaltyDongs> Hi pat and chat
[0:31:54] <+OranHexthief> the new thing @AngriestPat
[0:31:54] <+d00msdaydan> it literally told you what to do

[0:32:00] <%MaiHusbando9S> you gotta work for your pickle

[0:32:04] <%SergentSov> Time for an expedition!

[0:32:34] <WeissWyrm> Am I late for the pickle fighting?
[0:32:35] <babyridah> @AngriestPat Fuck you, Pat

[0:36:32] <Crippl3> @AngriestPat you should watch the new Noclip 2-part documentary on Warframe, it totally goes into how and why Warframe is such a huge pile of stuff bolted together, it's super informative and entertaining

[1:56:30] <$drbuttss> Don't lewd the cat

[1:56:50] <Mr_LupLup> @stirlingw17 No its clearly not out at all
[1:56:54] <cizal11> jagras probably
[1:56:55] <SwindlerOfProgress> I think Jagras hit it.
[1:56:57] <TebbyTF2> You are educated stupid, TimeCube is superior to timezones
[1:56:57] <CaptainSharkFace> Literally ignores the material drops. Every time. NotLikeThis
[1:57:00] <Deosier> i yhink jagras
[1:57:07] <+stfn893> Elmo my be tinier but he is definitely smarter than pat
[1:57:12] <stirlingw17> @Mr_LupLup didn't know if he just changed his time zone on ps4 or something
[1:57:16] <NinjaSloth1618> There is no greater shame for the once majestic predator than to be cuddled and babied in front of an audience of thousands
[1:57:19] <cizal11> hammer dude carrying super hard
[1:57:19] <CarditoSoRico> anotha wiff
[1:57:19] <+Jermatoo> That miss rooKek
[1:57:31] <GalaxyGirlChel> deh angwy pickole
[1:57:32] <Mr_LupLup> @stirlingw17 I wish that was something that one could do, but no
[1:57:50] <Bobato_Chaps> Pat when are you going to learn that the hammer is truly the most superior of weapons?
[1:57:51] <%badmr7> Pat come on, girls aew watching
[1:57:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LOL
[1:57:52] <cizal11> the hypest whiffs on youtube

[1:58:11] <cizal11> no for real hammer guy is killin it while pat is fuckin it up
[1:58:13] <+byeblackbird> Hammer dude is going to town
[1:58:16] <SwindlerOfProgress> Goddamn, hammer man is doing work.
[1:58:19] <stirlingw17> @Mr_LupLup yea i'm just thinking like the bat man calender man trick. that and just got off work and forgot you have to be connected to the internet
[1:58:22] <GalaxyGirlChel> go hammer dude
[1:58:23] <+machshop> fuckin love that slope with a hammer
[1:58:25] <corn_on_fire> this stream is making me think that greatswords just suck, cause it's hard to hit stuff with it
[1:58:27] <%SaltyDongs> Spin to win
[1:58:28] <Parapattern> Seriously, does ANY monster stand still for long enough to deliver that big GS attack Pat is trying to pull off?
[1:58:30] <%MisterCrimson> I always forget, what does dragonblight do?
[1:58:31] <+Jermatoo> Hammer players are gods, I've learned that from playing monhun for years.
[1:58:40] <+Can_Do_Kamel> lol pat missed 99% of all the hits he attempted git gud pat
[1:58:41] <Mr_LupLup> @stirlingw17 Its okay, I just like taking the piss outta people

[1:58:49] <stirlingw17> the hammer is bae
[1:58:50] <Loststoryteller> respect hammer bro
[1:58:50] <SwindlerOfProgress> @MisterCrimson Removes your elemental damage.
[1:58:51] <cizal11> that worked
[1:58:54] <+BYToady> dragonblight locks down elemental damage and status effects
[1:58:58] <+BYToady> I think
[1:59:01] <CronoMagnum> Pat got some hits in tho
[1:59:04] <+Jermatoo> That poot LUL
[1:59:06] <cereal_box_conspiracy> By the time this game comes out on PC everyone else will have moved on from the game. That shit is so annoying.
[1:59:09] <%maskedriderhero> So wait, did they take away Jho's laser, or does he do it when enraged?

[2:16:15] <Slasher9485> @AngriestPat Is it worth melding decorations with streamstones, or should I only do it with the highest ranked streamstones?
[2:16:17] <%cerass> dont want to spam this but the discord is for who now?
[2:16:29] <cizal11> it'd probably be better for woolie to play it for himself with no lp pressure anyway, like with his eventual playthrough of nier automata

[2:17:59] <Enthaarungscreme> Pat is losing the Argument, against a cat
[2:18:03] <CptHarlok> Elmo's been dead for a long time. Pat just uses him as an excuse to disquise the sound of the woman that him and Paige have in the basement.
[2:18:04] <+payatanharkonnen> Don’t waste water
[2:18:06] <%MrBoltstrike> "I'm not gonna drown Elmo" he says, then goes on to fill his tub with water.

[2:21:20] <DantesAnimus> He's actually got three of the same dumpster cat in his cake closet
[2:21:22] <+Psyco6> Pat used Crazy Talk to bring Elmo back to life
[2:21:26] <Parapattern> Pat made a sweet helmet out of Elmo
[2:21:33] <ThePuddingDead> agreed
[2:21:37] <%TheGreatBamBe> when's the dmc event quest anyways
[2:21:38] <+nepwar> its so bad that i stopped playing it
[2:21:40] <%DatAsuna> Peragus is GREAT... the first time
[2:21:42] <diiizle> I like the mining station more than Taris :(
[2:21:44] <+ArcticAsylum> KOTOR starter levels are so bad. Fuck the station and Taris
[2:21:46] <CptHarlok> Fucking takes FOREVER too.
[2:21:54] <Shastafield> worse than the first kingdom hearts?
[2:21:59] <Overloard> is it worse than taris though 🤔
[2:22:05] <%Thelvl1king> It’s the power of the toxoplasmosis.
[2:22:06] <DoctorPavel4U> Peragus is a really really good atmospheric horror kind of experience the first time, second time around not as much
[2:22:08] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat pat you need to reject your humanity to defeat Devil JOJO
[2:22:11] <lemon_lore> when did skelmo get a bra
[2:22:11] <cizal11> it's super fucking long
[2:22:23] <Afterman_> do kotor 2 lp and SKIP IT
[2:22:25] <+ArcticAsylum> I could do it in 2 hours or less maybe
[2:22:30] <mr_slaide> Skelmo is going through a phase.
[2:22:33] <%DatAsuna> Peragus is the same problem with ll linear and tight intros
[2:22:40] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat There's a mo to skip Peragus.
[2:22:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> @lemon_lore VVymyn's day celebration
[2:22:43] <Overloard> it has a pretty great outro
[2:22:44] <+nepwar> @AngriestPat also has the spacesuit section where you go so slow without mods
[2:22:47] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Why Elmo scream
[2:22:49] <+HelloImTom08> I like evil Atlan

[2:23:31] <legendarysabertooth> Pat, question, I want to calibrate my tv perfectly, what do?
[2:23:32] <MoulesFritz> PAt just has terrible taste in party memebers
[2:23:32] <CrackerJack450> @angriestpat hope Rajang is next :D
[2:23:39] <+ArcticAsylum> Please play Pat. PLEASE. FOR US.
[2:23:42] <diiizle> When's the last time you played it Pat? Taris is really bad too and you seemed fine with that
[2:23:44] <+SuichiTanaka> Math is cool when it results in BIG DAMAGE
[2:23:46] <$TheOnlyStrayCat> @ccwettr123 SHHHHHH SPOILS.
[2:23:52] <+ccwettr123> lol
[2:23:52] <+ArcticAsylum> We cant handle RPG Woolie anymore
[2:23:55] <cizal11> aren't all expedition monsters weaker than their quest counterparts
[2:23:57] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> I hate Atton and his stupid Speeth Impethiment
[2:24:00] <+valkuma> expedition versions are usually easier so you dont get wrecked on the story missions
[2:24:01] <Jaxnos> fight a tempered one?
[2:24:01] <%Thelvl1king> Crazy talk!
[2:24:07] <Garrison27> I just want to see Nargacuga
[2:24:08] <+Psyco6> Persona 3 is still the best Persona game
[2:24:08] <Parapattern> @legendarysabertooth You need Pat's special lizard eyes
[2:24:08] <+TardyClock> The expedition you fought was fighting an azure rathalos
[2:24:14] <+TardyClock> And a bunch of other stuff
[2:24:16] <%maskedriderhero> So it turns out, Deviljho fucking bodies Diablos when they fight each other. Blos get's fucking suplexed
[2:24:27] <Afterman_> no no heres what you do: record and release all of the videos of the mine level at once so ppl can power thru it
[2:24:29] <haisho> as cool as Nargacuga is, I just want myyy flippyboi
[2:24:34] <+Generalfroggy> HAs Pat played "Slay the Spire" yet? It has numbers and cards and rogue lite elements to it and I think he'll like it
[2:24:34] <Tearonex> @AngriestPat Nah, I just fought the investigation version it wasn't as tough as the expedition one
[2:24:39] <MAX116030> I feel bad for Liam he tries to comprehend Kingdom Hearts story but his brain gets hurt from it
[2:24:41] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> I need *more* RPG woolie
[2:24:43] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat The servers could be having a bit of stress because of Jho right now
[2:24:43] <+ChodicusPrime> I just wanna see D-Jo use things as weapons
[2:25:00] <prime_name> What other Turfs does he have?
[2:25:00] <+Jermatoo> Fart Pickle is really strong lore wise.
[2:25:03] <+valkuma> Diablos was the worst monster in MHW. Such a terribly made fight IMO. unless you lance or gunlance him
[2:25:07] <Slasher9485> Can deviljho fight elder dragons?
[2:25:07] <legendarysabertooth> @parapattern lol but seriously I don’t want the screen burn
[2:25:10] <+Gangnamon> jho doesnt seem to have a turf war withpaolumu. that fucked me up
[2:25:11] <%MisterCrimson> I know the Bazel turf war ends in a draw
[2:25:17] <+mobius_won> alatreon is god tho basically
[2:25:19] <%maskedriderhero> Basil is strong in that it has bombs all over itself
[2:25:19] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat pat you need to reject your humanity to defeat Devil JOJO
[2:25:29] <+crimsonharvest> Jho is like the onion's shrieking ball of white hot rage
[2:25:29] <President_valentine> Bow wrecks Diablos
[2:25:30] <TyrantBelial> it only ends in a drawe because bazel'as explosions keep him safe
[2:25:33] <Sunstalker> Did they make honeybadger style monster yet?
[2:25:36] <+mastertwin2> Doesn't Rajang square up with Elders?
[2:25:37] <TyrantBelial> iotherwise Deviljho trashes Bazel
[2:25:38] <Bobato_Chaps> Khezu is real final boss
[2:25:39] <Greywyn00> white fatalis is supposedly the strongest
[2:25:41] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Zinogre
[2:25:42] <Bardofkeys> @AngriestPat glad to see I can watch my favorite twitch streamer all the while dealing with these god awful ff14 dps que times X_X/
[2:25:43] <haisho> but Rajang spirit bomb though
[2:25:43] <gensoukaizou> monster hunter frontier?
[2:25:48] <Slasher9485> @MisterCrimson Jho does a bit more damage to Beze, so he sort of wins the draw
[2:25:48] <%Fizzeism> What about Hunter riding a KIrin in MH Stories Kappa
[2:25:50] <Megamands694> jho and ragang are the same star level as ELDER DRAGONS
[2:25:57] <SlashingIce> rajang eats kirins
[2:25:59] <cizal11> DON'T FORGET TO PICK UP DROPPED MATERIALS
[2:26:02] <AirlineFood74> GJ Pat not using the camp that's right ehre
[2:26:03] <+amurter19> has he killed deviljho a couple times already?
[2:26:05] <AirlineFood74> there*
[2:26:08] <+DespondentSloth> frontier has some hilarious monsters
[2:26:13] <Bloodbourneidentity> what about that huge leviathan snake in 4?
[2:26:18] <+zetaplus> idk i feel hellblade glavenus might give jho a run for its money
[2:26:18] <+fireking900> theres an mmo of monhun?
[2:26:21] <diiizle> He's killed him 3 times
[2:26:21] <AirlineFood74> @amurter19 capped thrice, killed none
[2:26:22] <+ChodicusPrime> Nice move
[2:26:27] <AirlineFood74> iirc
[2:26:27] <+other_badger> korea/japan only mmo yeah
[2:26:30] <%maskedriderhero> Savage Jho and Furious Rajang are as strong, if not stronger, than fucking Elder Dragons
[2:26:31] <+Digitalfw33k> !uptime
[2:26:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 26m 40s.
[2:26:34] <Kilagn> thats a big fuckin boi
[2:26:35] <AirlineFood74> he's capped him a bunch is my point
[2:26:39] <ragasquid> is this the part where we yell je suis monte
[2:26:49] <AirlineFood74> JE SUIS MONTE
[2:26:50] <+amurter19> id cap it too lol
[2:26:52] <+BrainlessViking> How is Pat punching the Jho?
[2:26:56] <KTDelgado> he takes A LOT
[2:26:56] <%Lostinafantasy> Can I get a link to Pat's discord?
[2:27:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> subs only
[2:27:14] <cizal11> rip baby jagras he just wanted to help
[2:27:14] <+other_badger> no, the part where we all yelled je suis monte was when not!guildmarm was monte
[2:27:14] <+Jigokuro> LUL that jagras got 1-shot
[2:27:15] <Bobato_Chaps> THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE
[2:27:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> option in discord
[2:27:23] <Parapattern> Jho is so angry because all his teeth make it so no one wants to smooch him
[2:27:25] <$Sayie> The fact that Pat goes for the super big charges without actually using Focus confuses me
[2:27:27] <AirlineFood74> @legendarysabertooth that person is a sub
[2:27:27] <+amurter19> What do you have to do to fight deviljho? I just got the fifth area
[2:27:29] <MAX116030> Chat did Pat Joe's tail?
[2:27:32] <Sunstalker> Pat breathing in and out with his swings is adorable

[2:28:15] <ragasquid> DEEP PICKLE
[2:28:20] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> umm
[2:28:20] <+mobius_won> mfw jho can attack in traps
[2:28:24] <%maskedriderhero> You can't out Jho in the hole! It only makes him stronger!
[2:28:29] <AirlineFood74> @amurter19 his special assignment is hr *7, I don't know if he invades lower HR like Bazel
[2:28:35] <MrHappyFunshine> The jho has always looked so funny to me
[2:28:37] <DoctorPavel4U> Only pitfalls
[2:28:39] <+fistorage> how many traps are there
[2:28:54] <%maskedriderhero> Two, pitfall and electirc
[2:28:56] <+amurter19> hmm, maybe I can fight him then
[2:28:57] <%Fizzeism> Jagras is going to eat Deviljho whole PogChamp
[2:29:00] <+amurter19> Thanks!
[2:29:21] <%AbnormalVoid> no Pat, you want to cut his tail
[2:29:22] <cizal11> why does this casino guy always trap them out of the hard knockdown instead of right when it ends
[2:29:25] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> god he's big.
[2:29:26] <ThatLoliFromPersona> Get him jagras
[2:29:27] <+Jigokuro> he got a jagras LUL
[2:29:31] <+fireking900> woaw
[2:29:32] <MAX116030> its weird how Joe's tail looks delicious to cut
[2:29:35] <+TerryTheTurret> Jagras nooo rooCry
[2:29:38] <Bobato_Chaps> Old Skidmarks
[2:29:40] <+VariantX7> Jagras...you got him on the ropes!!
[2:29:46] <+valkuma> KILL IT FOR CARVES PogChamp
[2:29:47] <Parapattern> Imagine Jagras stretching out big enough so all of Jho is in his belly
[2:29:54] <+other_badger> hot
[2:29:58] <%Fizzeism> Jagras fucked up Deviljho so bad that he is now limping Kappa
[2:30:08] <legendarysabertooth> Wow Midir sure looks different
[2:30:10] <%Poddy_> apatSmug
[2:30:18] <legendarysabertooth> Pat, question, I want to calibrate my tv perfectly, what do?
[2:30:23] <Mrbaconator> some PEACH SALIVA?
[2:30:26] <haisho> truly befitting the title of Great, fighting off a Deviljho
[2:30:29] <+TsunamiPoro> oh i get it
[2:30:34] <Bobato_Chaps> why is he so easy?
[2:30:40] <mr_slaide> Pat has a need for Saliva.
[2:30:41] <cizal11> when's demon king jagras
[2:30:42] <Quietshun13> gem?
[2:30:47] <%DatAsuna> meow
[2:30:49] <Cafe_Spider> need some saliva. cue peachsaliva
[2:30:50] <+other_badger> because he's in a team of 4 endgame chars?
[2:30:59] <%AbnormalVoid> she's in Portland @AngriestPat
[2:30:59] <+TsunamiPoro> we know hes dead now pat you dont need to pretend
[2:31:05] <+MugenSandan> DA BAY BEE
[2:31:06] <MAX116030> @AngriestPat have you seen Maximilian playing FF15? He finished it and now its his 3rd Favorite FF
[2:31:07] <%Jjrossman> Evening ya'll
[2:31:11] <MyDarkStorm> MOTHER FUCKER
[2:31:13] <CrackerJack450> @angriestpat hope we get Tajang next!
[2:31:15] <iwasJase> @AngriestPat have you seen the Jho GS? Gaijin thinks it could be the top tier for the weapon right now.
[2:31:15] <%Intersceptre> @angriestpat I've heard from some hunters and it appears the Jho weapons have some custom movement when they charge. Horn opens its 'mouth' when it does tunes, Lance apparently spins up on power guard and charge
[2:31:17] <Afterman_> PATS NOT USING GATHERING HUB
[2:31:21] <+amurter19> Also, how the heck did you get rhino warframe so quick, pat?
[2:31:26] <ragasquid> what sword does he have right now?
[2:31:26] <%AbnormalVoid> OpieOP
[2:31:30] <%MisterCrimson> I'd bet on Narga before Rajang
[2:31:32] <AirlineFood74> @amurter19 I think capping him in expedition when the game says he's been sighted skips the gathering steps part for his special assignment
[2:31:34] <%NWR_James> ...
[2:31:38] <%maskedriderhero> Ew
[2:31:41] <Jaxnos> filf
[2:31:41] <@thenefftw> I know that feeling
[2:31:43] <%Intersceptre> >moustache feels
[2:31:44] <%NWR_James> "Water"
[2:31:46] <+amurter19> I've been playing on and off and still dont have rhino
[2:31:46] <cizal11> he either rushed to phobos or got lucky with an alert dropping the right materials
[2:31:48] <MickeyMoore13> Someone explain why Pickle Charge Blade is Whirligig Saw
[2:31:50] <Wurd> PogChamp / it's Deviljho DAY!!!!!
[2:31:51] <Rellim80> Wat
[2:31:58] <cizal11> rhino is pretty quick to reach and make
[2:31:59] <%Intersceptre> i know it well, it's in my mouth 80% of the time
[2:31:59] <AirlineFood74> DRY YOUR FACIAL HAIR YOU FREAK
[2:32:04] <%AbnormalVoid> the Ball Hasack
[2:32:08] <diiizle> I just trimmed mine back because of the wetness FeelsBadMan
[2:32:15] <%maskedriderhero> It looks cool, at least
[2:32:19] <+valkuma> if you run damage calculations on weapons a lot of the harder ones are weaker than rarity 5 weapons.
[2:32:22] <fabnanman> why is it harder to get? did vaal get buffed?
[2:32:23] <WisdomHat> Pat's developing a weird as fuck southern accent
[2:32:29] <+VariantX7> I really need to get this game.
[2:32:30] <%mastermidget23> Wait, did the dante stuff come out?
[2:32:32] <funkerbuster> ball hasack my fav berserk villain
[2:32:35] <AirlineFood74> Will it fade away and be classed as OBSOLETE?
[2:32:36] <Innocuous_Goat> But fashion hunters tho
[2:32:39] <MAX116030> but is it "optimal" ? Kappa
[2:32:41] <%Intersceptre> >diablos GS
[2:32:43] <MyDarkStorm> ? thats -30
[2:32:45] <+zetaplus> but diablos gs is dead
[2:32:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> so people shouldnt use weapons if they like how they look? is it really all about stats?
[2:32:48] <Axonn1018> Go Diablos...? But there's no Diablos GS
[2:32:55] <Bobato_Chaps> Anguish
[2:32:57] <%bhbobby> How's chat doing tonight, guys? First time here live.
[2:33:00] <Banjoboozle> @AngriestPat Pat, the Longsword is fucking busted now. They overbuffed the everliving hell out of the Foresight Slash
[2:33:04] <Parapattern> Man, I wish there weren't so many dragon element weapons
[2:33:05] <%Fizzeism> Hiatus is my favorite Berserk villian
[2:33:13] <AirlineFood74> @MyDarkStorm not a big deal, the -30% can be offset with skills
[2:33:17] <cizal11> you can probably use any max rank weapon just fine, but some will always be better than others
[2:33:18] <AirlineFood74> like Pat's doing now
[2:33:20] <%Intersceptre> CRIT DRAW
[2:33:24] <+amurter19> @cizal11 I just unlocked phobos for plastids, last thing i need, but I feel liek I've put 30 hours in at least with mag lol
[2:33:26] <ThatLoliFromPersona> Us great sword users need enough buffs to crash the game
[2:33:29] <%Intersceptre> Bazel B arms you fool.
[2:33:36] <kwerddolan> What weapon was he calling shit?
[2:33:36] <+Cervantas> @angriestpat what does negative affinity do?
[2:33:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> COCK GOBBLER
[2:33:41] <+crimsonharvest> Speed Eater is my dream job
[2:33:43] <%MisterCrimson> What are good skills for Charge Blade?
[2:33:47] <+other_badger> vaal hazak GS
[2:33:49] <%Heartlander> Affinity is a crit chance, basically.
[2:33:55] <Grayhammatter> devilijho alpha has speed eater +3
[2:33:56] <AirlineFood74> @kwerddolan vaal GS
[2:33:57] <%Heartlander> Negative affinity means a chance to do LESS damage than usual.
[2:34:00] <Tensolin01> @kwerddolan Val hazard greatsword
[2:34:02] <MAX116030> @Fizzeism why pat said that manga is on hiatus again, isnt next issue should come at the end of this month?
[2:34:04] <%Intersceptre> if ypu dont use Bazel B arms youre a fool
[2:34:08] <+Cervantas> Does it really mean that?
[2:34:09] <Lionkevinson> I'm scared....
[2:34:10] <Tensolin01> Hazak *
[2:34:21] <+other_badger> yeah, it's essentially a fumble chance
[2:34:27] <+Cervantas> Ew
[2:34:47] <%Kevendithas> gobble those pickles
[2:34:50] <Parapattern> Negative affinity turns you into a bumble king
[2:34:53] <+ArcadeTrick> Only attack lv 4 LUL
[2:34:54] <%OfficerMods> BAKUNETSU
[2:34:54] <+other_badger> it's a "feel-bad" stat but it's not really that awful
[2:34:54] <%bhbobby> Gobbler sounds dirty lol
[2:34:56] <%OfficerMods> PAT C'MON
[2:34:58] <%OfficerMods> BOMBS
[2:35:00] <funkerbuster> @max116030 we read online leaks so the official release date doesnt matter
[2:35:04] <+TerryTheTurret> Speed Eating is awesome
[2:35:09] <iwasJase> Pat's a gobbler
[2:35:10] <+SpaghettiPuncher> @MisterCrimson Artillery is good for the impact phials
[2:35:18] <+Xanadirrr> The end is a chained nutsack
[2:35:18] <+honorable_captain_garlock> weird dick
[2:35:22] <+crimsonharvest> I finally got the Vaal Hazak hammer that's actually an Axe
[2:35:22] <shin_garbage> I kinda wish jho's breath attack was still a big fuck you laser and not just black smoke
[2:35:23] <%Poddy_> apatSmug "GOBBLER"
[2:35:25] <Flurbleman44> looks like a sledgehammer with teeth
[2:35:26] <+SenorCounter> Pickle gobbler
[2:35:26] <Wurd> D: It's not! it's Cool
[2:35:27] <prime_name> That's a tasty dick.
[2:35:30] <+Cervantas> That sword looks super dumb
[2:35:33] <Banjoboozle> @AngriestPat Pat the Long Sword is fucking busted now. They buffed the FUCK out of Foresight Slash
[2:35:34] <+amurter19> I want that fan design greatsword
[2:35:35] <thelonechris> Fucksword AKA dildo
[2:35:36] <%AbnormalVoid> like...how does whoever designed it look at that sword on not see a big old dick and balls?
[2:35:36] <haisho> well it comes from what's effectively a voracious vegetable
[2:35:37] <+AnotherRequiem> tge charge blade lopks sick
[2:35:39] <%Intersceptre> use Crit Draw you buffooooon
[2:35:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> Dumb Looking Fuck Sword
[2:35:42] <lord_souls> i'm a fan of speed eating to wait where talk about monster hunter
[2:35:46] <OmegaTrigun> with the balls on the end LUL
[2:35:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat Anythings a dildo if you're brave enough.
[2:35:51] <Afterman_> U HAVE GOBBLER ON UR HELM
[2:35:55] <+valkuma> "Shoring up weaknesses is the best thing you can do" "dont stack crit if you have low affinity"
[2:36:00] <+other_badger> looks more like a knot than balls
[2:36:12] <MAX116030> @funkerbuster ARE YOU SERIOUS? RIGHT WHEN ..... UUUUUGGH dont tell me that Mangaka is on hiatus because of Monster Hunter world
[2:36:21] <%DatAsuna> He might prefer some longer les
[2:36:23] <%Intersceptre> @valkuma he means Crit Boost
[2:36:29] <OmegaTrigun> @other_badger oh kinky Kappa
[2:36:34] <%bhbobby> I currently don't have a PS4 but this game and FighterZ is tempting me to get one
[2:36:36] <Parapattern> It basically has trucknuts, but for a sword
[2:36:37] <Banjoboozle> @AngriestPat Diablos Nero B are amazing arms, they're the ones I use them.
[2:36:42] <+other_badger> I mean crit is a really easy-to-calculate dps change so if the numbers don't work hey don't work
[2:36:52] <+other_badger> of course pat might still be WRONG
[2:36:52] <OmegaTrigun> swordnuts LUL
[2:36:58] <%Remery_> Just saw Jho vs Bazel apparently Bazel wins
[2:37:01] <KTDelgado> head atack doesnt knock over deviljo

[2:48:22] <+crimsonharvest> I'm going with the story that that Jho's red scars are stretch marks cause hes fat from eating so much
[2:48:24] <+valkuma> the level 3 strike is like FULL CHANCE THE FLARED STALLION mode
[2:48:24] <+Matto424> That's Jho stuff yeah
[2:48:26] <+SenorCounter> The second it fully charges it becomes engorged
[2:48:29] <DantesAnimus> eeewwww that makes me a lil uncomfortable

[2:49:04] <%Fizzeism> upsidedown01 Capture you have to capture, but hunt is just win the fight
[2:49:17] <Shastafield> PogChamp
[2:49:18] <upsidedown01> is the monster's health ever displayed as a meter or a number
[2:49:22] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> PUFF
[2:49:28] <spoofcaptain> no health barr
[2:49:30] <%bv728> @upsidedown01 No.
[2:49:33] <%DoctorPavel4U> At most it's the heart beat meter in the bottom left
[2:49:33] <upsidedown01> fuck

[2:49:52] <deviljhojho94> Kappa
[2:49:54] <+crimsonharvest> Before this game there weren't even damage numbers on hits
[2:49:54] <spoofcaptain> you can tell pretty obviously when to capture/almsot dead
[2:49:57] <cizal11> "tonight"
[2:49:58] <+Gangjute8> You usually have a good idea of health bc they run away in phases
[2:49:59] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @deviljhojho94 LUL

[2:57:25] <AirlineFood74> @TheyCallMeVawn some event quests are but monsters are perma
[2:57:27] <Tensolin01> Not a pvp game
[2:57:28] <+Strayed1> PVP LUL
[2:57:33] <EVA_Unit02> It's called Monster Hunter not Hunter X Hunter Kappa
[2:57:36] <cizal11> wow what a good prepared veteran monster hunter
[2:57:36] <Mnightshyamallama> what are some of the best items to take with you on hunts?
[2:57:39] <%Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> PvP is for plebs like Woolie
[2:57:42] <GraakosGraakos> His sword and shield, switch axe, lance, and gun lance are all really neat
[2:57:43] <%bhbobby> When are they going to add monster hunting to this game?
[2:57:43] <+HelloImTom08> the bow looks so fucking cool, its like your shooting arrows out of a big ol FIST moon2AWW
[2:57:48] <+valkuma> pvp in this game would be bows bows bows bows bows
[2:57:51] <+OranHexthief> but could you imagine competition hunts though?
[2:57:51] <KungFooMaen> what rings you use bro
[2:57:51] <+beautiful_wife_and_kids> but what if one player is a hunter n one is the monster atpRtsd4
[2:57:53] <%MadameColeen> there is pvp, its called arm wrestling
[2:57:54] <+Sonbunns> Pvp but one player controls the monster
[2:57:57] <linkwolf4> player unknown's monster hunter coxMurkeh
[2:57:58] <Flurbleman44> when does battle royal come out for it?
[2:57:59] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat did you forget you have a camp open in zone 9?
[2:58:00] <%MisterCrimson> They added PvP in MvCi
[2:58:00] <deviljhojho94> woolie would dominate the MHW PVP scene with his sick rainbow pimp style
[2:58:00] <+AGRO_91> why not just add a fucking battle royale mode while theyre at it LUL
[2:58:07] <Tensolin01> @mnightshyamallama healing items :D
[2:58:09] <TaurusOxford> @Sonbunns Now THAT I would play
[2:58:10] <AirlineFood74> zone 8*
[2:58:12] <%Fizzeism> PvP would be fun for me because I could just sick my kinsect after everyone Kappa
[2:58:12] <%AbnormalVoid> it would be cool if there was something like competetive hunts
[2:58:18] <+Strayed1> But monster hunter is just like my dark souls!!! it needs pvp
[2:58:18] <%Remery_> I've been playing with the Jho Bow and why are there chains and leather straps wrapped around my arm? xD
[2:58:27] <+creamandsugar> get his mouth?
[2:58:33] <%Remery_> So weird
[2:58:36] <GraakosGraakos> @Remery_ Is it a megaman gauntlet? It looks like one.
[2:58:39] <+skylerpilot> @GraakosGraakos his Lance and Gunlance are bonkers, their numbers make 0 sense in comparison to the rest of the options. IM MAKING THEM BOTH
[2:59:01] <bit_guardian> Jho's sevvered tail reminds me of the Hydra's neck stumps from Hercules.
[2:59:11] <%stoicman90> lol i killed jho with a waterslide
[2:59:19] <%Remery_> @GraakosGraakos a little, looks more like a cat's paw

[3:01:41] <ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat You having fun tho?
[3:01:42] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> I thought Pat was a GS user since... MH1 ? Am I remembering this wrong?
[3:01:45] <iwasJase> @Minorou the goodest of bois
[3:01:45] <shin_garbage> He's kinda a bully tbh
[3:01:48] <KTDelgado> I KILED HIM FINALLY
[3:01:52] <bit_guardian> @Minorou He is best boy behind Dodogama
[3:01:56] <Tensolin01> You got a ranged weapon to break his face?
[3:01:58] <mr_slaide> The problem is that GS is a bad weapon for Jho, he moves around too much.
[3:02:05] <%captainthunderwolf> You guys think the Deviljho items have chains and straps on them to keep the weird monster flesh contained? The way some of his weapons swell up seem to imply that his freakish meat is actually still partially alive after it becomes a weapon.
[3:02:07] <%GarbageNirvana> So is everyone rocking jho gear now
[3:02:14] <linkwolf4> I don't like how tall jho is, how am i supposed to hit with my tiny ass knives
[3:02:16] <ragasquid> time to murder
[3:02:18] <%spacekataz18> Scalps and Tallfangs I believe
[3:02:19] <Garrison27> Odogoron is the bestest boy
[3:02:24] <GraakosGraakos> @AngriestPat That can't be true. I captured 4 of them and have scalps
[3:02:34] <iwasJase> gotta break his face for the tallfang and that scalp
[3:02:36] <haisho> @linkwolf4 nip away at his feet like an angry chihuahua

[3:02:54] <%ECRead> @Garrison27 i also enjoy that flesh pupper

[3:04:24] <%TaifuDragon> If you want to build the deviljho set you're gonna need more plastids
[3:04:27] <lucentfawn06> what patch update is your NH:W?
[3:04:28] <Mnightshyamallama> @CitrusDrink how have you been dealing with the flying monsters with duel blades? I have a hard time getting them out of the air when using those
[3:04:34] <%TamsynRRD> I hate fighting deviljho
[3:04:35] <%stoicman90> use blast ammo for jhos face
[3:04:38] <lucentfawn06> MH:W
[3:04:45] <%TamsynRRD> He's another stunlocking monster.
[3:04:55] <Banjoboozle> @AngriestPat Do you want me to link you my Damascus set, Pat? It has Atk+4, Focus+3, WE+3, and a bunch of extra slots that I use for Defense+4 and Gobbler+3, with a few extras
[3:04:56] <CurrySauseBandit> @graakosgraakos Thanks. Was thinking SnS, glaive and DB would do well. Didn't consider lance though.
[3:05:03] <+Tracb01> is this quest hr100?
[3:05:04] <TimberWulfe> we bullying an angry pickle tonight?
[3:05:04] <GraakosGraakos> @TamsynRRD Make the stun charm. I did and it changed my life.

[3:05:21] <bit_guardian> @TimberWulfe It's been back and forth bully.
[3:05:22] <linkwolf4> pat about to hop in that MH lab
[3:05:25] <Slasher9485> I pray that rathalos comes in and gets his shit pushed in by Deviljho this hunt
[3:05:33] <mrblakeybear> @angriestpat hows the workouts going?
[3:05:37] <Mnightshyamallama> @valkuma do I just need to farm a ton of those are cultivate a lot of them?
[3:05:43] <shin_garbage> dude the rath turf war is so fucking cool
[3:05:44] <Psyramics> even for ranged classes, flash pods make every flying monster so much easier
[3:05:44] <cizal11> oh rathalos is there we could get some cool shit to happen
[3:05:49] <GraakosGraakos> @CurrySauseBandit As far as I can tell, getting good at Lance is like a whole other game as far as playstyle and difficulty go.
[3:05:49] <shin_garbage> he gets fucked so good
[3:05:56] <+valkuma> @AngriestPat sharpness protection is better than handicraft. sharpen before engage and good to go
[3:06:01] <iwasJase> @AngriestPat Gaijinhunter suggested Handicraft +3 on a a Jho GS.
[3:06:02] <%WorthlessSamurai> He’ll eat Jagras midfight anyway Kappa
[3:06:05] <%Fenrirlives> YEAH I MADE IT!
[3:06:07] <%TamsynRRD> @GraakosGraakos If I use that, I don't know if I'll have the attack to bring hiom down since he knocks me back everytime I get withing range.
[3:06:10] <%nowhere1976> hows the deviljho hunting going
[3:06:21] <CurrySauseBandit> Guess i'mma try out Lance then. o:
[3:06:29] <+SergeEXE> I might take out Dragon Attack in my build for Earplugs
[3:06:36] <+MrWrann> Does having more hunters buff the monster or is it just better
[3:06:43] <+valkuma> Mnightshyamallama you can cultivate flash bugs, i keep 100 on hand and rarely craft them. if you know the movements that are flash-poddable you will only use 2-3 if you dps well, and if the monster AI is being nutty maybe 5
[3:06:44] <+zetaplus> this is basically a bully episode. where your hunter bullies a bully.
[3:06:47] <+amurter19> buffs monster
[3:06:55] <GraakosGraakos> @TamsynRRD With a rank 7 or 8 weapon? I didn't have any trouble hitting him for decent numbers with the Kadachi Fang, and I think it's only rank 6. Extermination's Edge hit him for decent numbers too.
[3:06:56] <cizal11> having more than 1 makes them stronger, but 4 hunters is still better than soloing

[3:12:19] <Minorou> it's on an elder dragon power level in the sense that it disrupts ecosystems
[3:12:21] <%WackyGear> does Deviljho evolve into the gaping dragon from ds 1?
[3:12:36] <GraakosGraakos> @TamsynRRD I had good luck with Nergi Head A, Dober B chest, Nergi B belt, Nergi B legs, and I can't remember my arms. Do you have the charms and the talons for your inventory?

[3:16:55] <GraakosGraakos> @TamsynRRD There are two charms you can buy from the dude in the tradeyard that give you a static boost to attack and defense. Later you can upgrade them with a Bazelgeuse Talon. Also, use Demondrug and Armorskin when you do a High Rank hunt. It helps a lot and lasts until you die.
