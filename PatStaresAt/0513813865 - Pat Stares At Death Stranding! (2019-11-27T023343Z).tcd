[0:07:09] <%Anime_Flux> Can't say I blame you, man
[0:07:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 I'm gonna shill Epic Battle Fantasy 5 again. My favorite JRPG, and it's about to get a free update that is literally an expansion pack worth of content, including randomizer shit. One of the best things about it is that it doesn't have a linear gear progression. All equips are unique, with different stats, elements+statuses, resistances, and secondary effects like steal on hit, boosting specific things, or casting spells on hit or as a counter or randomly between turns.
[0:07:09] <MrDonTacos_> FeelsBadMan
[0:07:12] <+Zeromaru2> Night Pat
[0:07:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 You just collect and upgrade all the gear, and then do loadouts with synergies, or that exploit weaknesses for a zone or boss. And there are several super dungeons that scale to your level, so you can do them as soon as you have a good enough loadout and tactics. And it's $15.
[0:07:14] <xenoboost> night pat
[0:07:17] <%Keyd00d> knew it
