[0:03:25] <BigFingerRo> Man, I had an argument with someone over life is strange and at some point he legit told me "if you need explanations, you should just watch marvel movies, you'll like those more"
[0:03:36] <%RayReborne> wait did they actually use Time Warp for one of the trailers or nah?
[0:03:39] <+Basker17> Hey guys, did the stream just start?

[0:04:14] <+ArCielArDor> I got deathloop last night. it's alright
[0:04:15] <+Basker17> @BigFingerRo What was the argument?
[0:04:17] <Necnill> I hear good things about this game
[0:04:23] <%RayReborne> @bigfingerro wow lamer, csnt believe you couldnt understand Life is stranges convoluted bullshit Kappa
[0:04:29] <+ArCielArDor> Pat is going to lose his mind though

[0:04:37] <%Dakuu75> Dakuu75 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! I'm about 3/4 through Heavensward and I've come to the conclusion that 90% of Eorzea's problems comes from ppl trying to summon Primals. (It's literally NEVER a good idea.)
[0:04:40] <MrDemsus> To buy Rise or loop? hmmm
[0:04:45] <%nicoleymcquack> didn’t it score like a 10 on a couple review sites?
[0:04:52] <+Basker17> @DianaTheAscian Dont spread misinfo, he said he probably couldnt play it because 3d motion makes him sick
[0:04:54] <Sartastic> rubrKuge rubrKuge rubrKuge

[0:04:56] <%tortugatime214> Hey Pat. Played blood borne for the first time this week, now I really wish a sequel or pc port would find its way into existence.
[0:04:59] <+Mateba6> pog I love arcane
[0:05:03] <BigFingerRo> @Basker17 I told them I hated LiS for how poorly it was written, its obnoxious characters and how shit just came out of the blue

[0:05:31] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> I swear when you tag people in this game it sounds like a metal gear sfx
[0:05:36] <%Frost_Quill> I loved Dishonored and if this is even a quarter as good I'll be happy.
[0:05:36] <BigFingerRo> And they hit me with the good ol "It's not for you"
[0:05:36] <%DianaTheAscian> @Basker17 so yes this game would make him sick

[0:09:25] <%RayReborne> multiplayer shooter Kappa
[0:09:26] <+Basker17> Oh my god, a coop? MPFPS?
[0:09:29] <kikoeru_san> Okay so what IS it
[0:09:29] <Qu1ckyyy> I thought it was a battle royale until yesterday
[0:09:30] <%YakumoYomi> I've watched a couple of streams of it today. And I agree: the advertised the wrong parts of this game.
[0:09:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Isn't it a MOBA?
[0:09:33] <jcflyguy> I thought it was a Borderlands
[0:09:33] <PickledParsleyParty> IT'S A SHLOOPER!
[0:09:36] <+bugz_munny> At least we're free from Deathloop trailers
[0:09:37] <Dunmarkh> never seen a trailer
[0:09:37] <%JoshManVGH> @emperordread The NEW Lawsuit!?
[0:09:38] <%dekkitout> It was not that poorly communicated
[0:09:38] <%Dakuu75> I thought it would be like a Bioshock
[0:09:43] <Archmortal> The advertising has communicated to me that it's a big PvP game
[0:09:44] <%asgard147> psaDogchamp BORK
[0:09:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> theres a new blizzard lawsuit?
[0:09:47] <%tusk102> what kind of game is it? @PatStaresAt
[0:09:49] <%linSP> wtf is a deathloop
[0:09:49] <heartlesshealer> I saw a peek, the writing seems fun if nothing else
[0:09:51] <+Basker17> Deathloop is OBVIOUSLY a Strand game
[0:09:53] <BurdRightsActivist> No kai leng NotLikeThis
[0:09:56] <%MonkeyTimelord> Paul V.G Marketing made a big ball of poop and then dropped that ball.
[0:09:56] <%hewlettfan96> It’s a shlooper
[0:09:58] <+NerevaRising> Wait, deathloop is a videogame?!?
[0:10:01] <%bassoontyphoon> psaUp
[0:10:01] <DancesWitBalrog> I'm more interested in Ren and Stimpy being in that Nickelodeon Smash game
[0:10:02] <+Mateba6> it's a strand type game
[0:10:02] <%nicoleymcquack> greg said daddy no work please
[0:10:03] <%DianaTheAscian> Also something new with blizzard happened today but idk what
[0:10:05] <%tusk102> oh neat
[0:10:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Beefy Giefy boi
[0:10:08] <%RealThiele> your mind control will not work on me again father
[0:10:10] <DSD24> Where you get to kill all the enemies
[0:10:10] <kazadaz> It's a recursive strand game
[0:10:12] <Treasure_Vault> So there's a scary moon?
[0:10:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Update! I got my nails did!
[0:10:15] <%BestTeaMaker> it's hitman x dishonored x majora's mask
[0:10:15] <SilverFaustX> its a boring shooter
[0:10:15] <@SSaryn> OH FUCK DID I HEAR THE WORD/GAME DEATHLOOP
[0:10:16] <%cooldude69xx> Pat slowly trying to make immersive sim a thing
[0:10:16] <%DianaTheAscian> Majora's Mask
[0:10:17] <+bobfriskit> So what system did you go with Pat?
[0:10:18] <%asgard147> That doesn't sound too bad limesThink
[0:10:19] <TheAntiNihilist> ?
[0:10:20] <BigFingerRo> @Basker17 Strand stands for strand :)
[0:10:23] <+raideyroo> It's a Majora's Mask FPS with a PVP element
[0:10:26] <%YakumoYomi> I had no idea it had an invader system
[0:10:28] <%hewlettfan96> Majoras Mask
[0:10:29] <BurdRightsActivist> Is this a strand-like game?
[0:10:32] <%MajorCrasher> it's not though?
[0:10:35] <+hiswill98> I’m very excited for this game but I can’t play it unfortunately. No PS5!
[0:10:37] <%dekkitout> Groundhog Day. Just fucking say it.
[0:10:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pity Date Stream, let's gooo
[0:10:39] <%BestTeaMaker> it's a really fucking good game
[0:10:42] <%FacetiousAF> yikes
[0:10:44] <+bugz_munny> Thats a super bumber
[0:10:45] <scrumbotime> Vileage may mary.
[0:10:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> The inability to quicksave and lack of material scrounging has set me free woolieGASM
[0:10:50] <%Goatbait> How come it'll bomb?
[0:10:52] <%RealThiele> bullsheet it its bad to call it mm
[0:10:52] <+Toshatron> the only time Gearbox style marketing would've helped
[0:10:52] <MasterTonberry23> play game and make with the funny fat man
[0:10:52] <%BestTeaMaker> they literally made dishonored 3
[0:10:58] <DSD24> I wish I had a PS5
[0:10:59] <kikoeru_san> Oh well fuck
[0:10:59] <%Monkeyweed21> yea Dishonored 2 was rough on launch
[0:10:59] <%tusk102> acti blizzard are now in a second lawsuit for labor law violations lmao
[0:11:00] <%JoshManVGH> Oooooh that PS5 Exclusivity is gonna fuck them, huh?
[0:11:00] <%hewlettfan96> Willie got married!! Hooray!! 🔥👏❤️
[0:11:01] <%MajorCrasher> why would it bomb? it's got rave reviews
[0:11:03] <%Stratiotai2> pc version fucked up?
[0:11:04] <BurdRightsActivist> PS5 LUL
[0:11:07] <%sweatch0> hey lads
[0:11:11] <+bugz_munny> An immersive sim that doesnt run well on PC is just....,
[0:11:11] <BurdRightsActivist> A CONSOLE THAT DOESN'T EXIST LUL
[0:11:12] <%MidnightBurst12> the mythical ps5
[0:11:13] <+raideyroo> Death of the Outsider was like Dishonored 2.5. Definitely wasn't Dishonored 3
[0:11:13] <@SSaryn> BTW, it's primarily because of the Anti Tamper but there is also a weird amount of frame pacing issues on the PC version alone even with the frame cap sometimes.
[0:11:13] <+bugz_munny> bleh
[0:11:14] <%bassoontyphoon> It’s like dishonoured with guns!
[0:11:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> @tusk102 We need a podcast!!!

[0:11:15] <%Fooguwu> Why would it bomb? Every streamer ever is playing it rn
[0:11:15] <marvel877> Too bad you can't get a PS5...
[0:11:16] <kikoeru_san> I was legit interested, avoided most of the bullshit
[0:11:19] <heartlesshealer> PC version is "Mileage my vary"
[0:11:22] <Archmortal> what if Dishonored but Majora's Mask time mechanics
[0:11:22] <BurdRightsActivist> "Update your tv" what the fuck that's scary

[0:11:36] <%UvBenServed> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:11:37] <@SSaryn> Is it because it literally tells you shut the fuck up and auto saves everytime you die?
[0:11:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude
[0:11:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mmmm that sounds real good. Real good
[0:11:38] <jorniev> deathloop... REALLY!?
[0:11:39] <kazadaz> Ah, so you can go back to Dishonoured now
[0:11:40] <heartlesshealer> NICE
[0:11:41] <%JoshManVGH> Enough to play Dishonored again?
[0:11:42] <ExpressNode> Wish it came to Xbox, could do PC but if that port is as bad as you say then fuck that
[0:11:42] <JokerNewby> sucks that I'm not much of a fan of the majora's mask style of game
[0:11:45] <jorniev> DAMN
[0:11:45] <+vaderxyz1970> how
[0:11:47] <%Stratiotai2> some might even called it goblin slayer

[0:12:40] <%cvp5127> CHAOS?!
[0:12:42] <%Monkeyweed21> its badly presented and they never bother to correct themselves
[0:12:44] <%Bailey__gaming> @PatStaresAt Father May I have some L O O P S?
[0:12:45] <%RealThiele> intentions mean jackall
[0:12:47] <%MajorCrasher> high and low chaos literally mean nothing. they just affect the ending @patstaresat  they spell it out from the beginning
[0:12:48] <kazadaz> If Dishonored sells better than this game, does that mean they got it right the first time?
[0:12:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> I stopped playing 2 cuz Emily was getting super fuckin edgy
[0:12:53] <%PocketBearIllustrator> also nice to see POC main characters in an FPS.
[0:12:55] <%Frost_Quill> You could kill every single target and a surprisingly large number of guards ands till get low chaos.
[0:12:56] <+nivlac_555> NO MORALS
[0:12:58] <xbb1024> So they killed Chaos?
[0:12:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> cool

[0:13:54] <valriot> It didnt bother me at all, but gamers are big dumb
[0:13:56] <%RealThiele> the implication
[0:13:57] <%Frost_Quill> High chaos changes are logical and make sense.
[0:13:58] <%Mr_Pylon> Also stealth sucked in Dishonored
[0:13:59] <%RayReborne> yo @ballerswagbro9k

[0:14:07] <%tusk102> "kill every motherfucker" - Deathloop
[0:14:08] <%VioletHeart> The only way I could brain goblin my way through Dishonored 1 was to accept I was doing a High Chaos run and just murder *everyone*.
[0:14:11] <@GeneralSCPatton> I have a slight suspicion that minion kills COULD matter in the final loop, since those will be real.
[0:14:12] <Djinnazz> @Mr_Pylon no it didn't
[0:14:13] <%Dopamien> by giving you even dumber ai lmao

[0:14:48] <%Frost_Quill> @VioletHeart You could kill every single target and a pretty big amount of the total guards before losing low chaos.

[0:23:06] <scrumbotime> I saw the cartoon before the movie, so I had, SKEWED perceptions.
[0:23:07] <%Bluwizard21> Star Ocean Till the end of Time was literally mass effect before mass effect
[0:23:07] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt oh dont worry I learned about SO3 after wards
[0:23:09] <%blastyoboots> Star Ocean 3: ruins the entire series
[0:23:09] <%Ipsenscastle> NAPPY TIME WITH EDGEY
[0:23:10] <circular7> 4 and 5 is trash
[0:23:10] <%blastyoboots> yes
[0:23:11] <Blank9> DINNER, DINNER, DINNER, DINNER
[0:23:13] <Zeif00> Side Kick, Side Kick, Side Kick, Side Kick
[0:23:13] <%YakumoYomi> Everything! Everything! EVERYTHING!
[0:23:14] <%cvp5127> star ocean has mage girl tho
[0:23:15] <turboyabo> to do the black dynimate plan of thought thing some one else has to be there with you
[0:23:16] <%IMDRanged> "Nappy time"
[0:23:17] <Teyaric> But 2 was so damned pure tho
[0:23:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> STARRO SHIN FOR WHAT?
[0:23:22] <%thebeargoesHONK> which game are we talking about?
[0:23:22] <MasterTonberry23> EFF STAR OCEAN 3 I AM NEVER PLAYING ANOTHER SO AFTER THAT
[0:23:22] <jcflyguy> Hey 3 was good except for the twist
[0:23:22] <zanzibarian_hamster> WHAT fucking norm died?!
[0:23:25] <%DianaTheAscian> i didn't know it went up to 4
[0:23:26] <%nicoleymcquack> they made a 4 but at what cost
[0:23:28] <%thebeargoesHONK> thank you
[0:23:29] <%RayReborne> big dinner, many Rice
[0:23:30] <%hewlettfan96> Everything everything
[0:23:37] <Archmortal> Star Ocean 3 had it real bad with backtracking AND shitty plot writing.  God damn.  Star Ocean 4 is still worse though, in writing AND gameplay
[0:23:37] <%Dakuu75> I always confuse "Star Ocean" with "Phantasy Star Online"
[0:23:38] <Laecerelius> EDGE MAVERICK, MAIN CHARACTER MAN
[0:23:41] <Zeif00> That twist Jesus
[0:23:41] <%shurtal> that twist is BULLSHIT
[0:23:42] <heartlesshealer> star ocean 3 was my first and I liked it. Wouldn't say "love", but I liked it. Love 2 though
[0:23:43] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking dumb!
[0:23:44] <%DianaTheAscian> oof
[0:23:45] <$Futurecity10> SO4 is good in a vacuum honestly
[0:23:46] <%Nekros4442> i mean...Maria from 3 is cool
[0:23:46] <scrumbotime> @GarbageQueenEllie Starro is a starfish, he doesn't have shins.
[0:23:47] <BigFingerRo> Hey @PatStaresAt is the DeathLoop inside the DiscRoom?
[0:23:48] <pet_purple_panda> Anaconda malt liquor makes ya _
[0:23:48] <+Basker17> GIB TWIST
[0:23:49] <circular7> 3 was okay until the twist
[0:23:49] <%Agami23> the twist makes mass effect 3's ending look good
[0:23:49] <ExpressNode> No one talks about 5. I remember when people talked about it years ago a launch. That game tanked
[0:23:52] <bob900000> so is it like mass effect 3
[0:23:53] <%BestTeaMaker> SO3 is fun to play at least
[0:23:54] <+Fefe41> 3 was super fun
[0:23:54] <%MooseIsGoose> its bad
[0:23:55] <%JoshManVGH> It's SO fucking dumb!
[0:23:55] <%Solid_Stro> It bad
[0:23:56] <%shruke> is 3 Till the End of Time, that's the only one I played
[0:23:58] <+DeRedBaron> oh god yes lol it would be uh "fun" if it wasn't for the entire series
[0:23:58] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt is 3's twist literally the mass effect 3 ending of star ocean
[0:23:58] <%blastyoboots> you have to erase Star Ocean 3 from your mind yeah
[0:23:58] <%hewlettfan96> Why is the game so awful??
[0:23:58] <MasterTonberry23> The twist killed all interest I had in SO forever
[0:23:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Star Ocean 4 has some good parts but it is NOT A GOOD GAME
[0:24:01] <@SSaryn> Dw, Phantasy Star Online 2 got the same treatment just less so with EP4
[0:24:04] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Is it Third Birthday bad?
[0:24:05] <Zeif00> Reverse Isekai
[0:24:07] <+DeRedBaron> yes it is til the end of time
[0:24:07] <heartlesshealer> Star Ocean 3 is to be played as your LAST Star Ocean
[0:24:08] <circular7> no one should ever talk about 5
[0:24:08] <+Drega707> Star Ocean 3 up to disk disk one, is like my favorite games
[0:24:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> @scrumbotime he got widdle seastar legs tho.
[0:24:10] <jcflyguy> Exactly, it was bullshit, they had to go backwards after
[0:24:12] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt worst than beyond?
[0:24:12] <%Monkeyweed21> its not great
[0:24:14] <%RayReborne> all a space dream?
[0:24:15] <%tank7013> For the longest time I thought Star Ocean and Star Tropics were the same thing
[0:24:15] <%WhereIsWill> only played like 20 hours of SO2
[0:24:16] <+ArCielArDor> was 3 the one with the MMO universe?
[0:24:17] <%YakumoYomi> @shruke Yes.
[0:24:17] <%cvp5127> at least 5 has mage girl
[0:24:18] <dyllustrate> What is the twist
[0:24:19] <%stubborndeer> IF you didn't see the movie or the series deathloop is about time portals and how to use them
[0:24:19] <bob900000> 3rd birthday is the worst
[0:24:20] <%Mr_Pylon> Worse than Heavy Rain lying to you?

[0:25:26] <+vaderxyz1970> How does that even work?
[0:25:27] <Mvrdok_> So just time beings? LUL
[0:25:29] <%hewlettfan96> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:25:29] <+BobxRawks_> Yo I literally fucking tuned into this stream and you hit me with this what the fuck
[0:25:31] <+albertomtc> What is a five dimensional being?? What
[0:25:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> LUL
[0:25:32] <mikeriffic> No we are third, fourth is time
[0:25:33] <Treasure_Vault> They get another version of time?
[0:25:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat were 3rd dimension not 4th
[0:25:36] <xbb1024> time is a dimension
[0:25:36] <jcflyguy> EXACTLY
[0:25:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> i don't know enough to know how that ruins things
[0:25:37] <kikoeru_san> We have up down side to side and TIME
[0:25:38] <%BoxNavy> you have to take dmt to see the 5th dimensional beings
[0:25:38] <%hewlettfan96> psaPat psaWrong psaDown
[0:25:39] <mikeriffic> fifth is reality
[0:25:44] <%baronblank> oh yea I remember hearing that
[0:25:45] <MasterTonberry23> I didnt even want to finish the game after the twist but managed to push through only because I liked the combat
[0:25:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> aw that sucks
[0:25:46] <%hewlettfan96> Time is a dimension
[0:25:47] <%DianaTheAscian> we 3d
[0:25:47] <%sleeplessmetro> sleeplessmetro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Yo Pat can’t stay too long but i’m looking forward to the VOD to see this over advertised game in action. Keep on keeping on!
[0:25:47] <%baronblank> thought it was a joke tbh
[0:25:48] <@SSaryn> Nah fuck that, I can play Star Ocean 1 and 2 and be fine, never gotta worry ever again, ez.
[0:25:52] <%Pachi3000> psaDown
[0:25:52] <+teh_rawk> 3rd birthday or other m? what was more damaging?
[0:25:53] <AXL808> double down on the twist!
[0:25:53] <%Ipsenscastle> but nappy time with edgey though Pat
[0:25:53] <dd44dostivei> nappy time
[0:25:54] <%MajorCrasher> we're 4th dimensional? NotLikeThis
[0:25:54] <%dekkitout> 5th dimensional can tangibly interact with time
[0:25:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt star ocean 4 references that twist as part of the villains motivation
[0:25:55] <%RayReborne> they killed their own franchise in a single swoop
[0:25:55] <Zeif00> Maria was cool tho
[0:25:55] <+bugz_munny> I thought 4th was seeing the totality of time
[0:25:56] <BoneofMalkav> 5ever?
[0:25:57] <OneThousandTomatoes> I'd never heard of star ocean until the arise stream
[0:25:57] <BliVru> OH GOD I thought you were talking about STONE OCEAN
[0:25:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Well it IS a game Kappa
[0:25:57] <+Fefe41> They basically never addressed the twist
[0:25:57] <viciousgrim> star ocean the last hope?
[0:25:58] <%tusk102> @BallerSwagBro9k i thought third dimension was 3d animated stuff
[0:25:59] <%rekinom> 3rd was my first star ocean
[0:25:59] <%cvp5127> that so awful i love it
[0:26:00] <%cooldude69xx> Thats the worst I can think of
[0:26:00] <ReaversEdge45> 5th dimensional beings are people who got their hands on a ps5
[0:26:00] <Mvrdok_> PSO2 has something similar LUL
[0:26:01] <%superc37> also yeah thats how i feel about the eva rebuilds tbh
[0:26:01] <Virokwet> why is it the whole franchise and not just 3?
[0:26:01] <xeroslash1> we are 4th dimension because we are 3 dimensional and travel along the 4th dimension of time
[0:26:01] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah that's nowhere near as bad as Third Birthday.
[0:26:02] <kikoeru_san> we live in 4-D
[0:26:02] <heartlesshealer> I thought 4 was set chronologically earlier than 3???
[0:26:03] <Jrocy247> Dude, in SO4 I got to the end of the Secret mega level dungeon and fought, lost, and said.....NOPE
[0:26:03] <%spitelite> we are 4d because we can observe time passing
[0:26:04] <JetpackMcQuack> it was all a video game ... gameattackWut
[0:26:04] <+ZephynM> Star Ocean 2 was the tits imo
[0:26:05] <blackjack8182> Is it like .Hack?
[0:26:07] <%SharkMissile> 2 is so fucking good
[0:26:08] <%JoshManVGH> 1 exists, two is great, and it's weird the series ended after that!
[0:26:10] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Wooooo
[0:26:12] <DSD24> Big tainted
[0:26:13] <SaltyAzteca> DOUBLE DOWN
[0:26:14] <%shruke> As someone who only played half of 3, does Star Ocean have a coherent universe between games?
[0:26:14] <%linSP> now I can’t play any of those games
[0:26:14] <MasterTonberry23> SO2 was so good
[0:26:17] <@SSaryn> Oh fuck I didn't know that
[0:26:17] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> So basically, play Star Ocean 1 and 2, and then nothing else?
[0:26:17] <heartlesshealer> OH
[0:26:18] <brexdq> arnt we 3d?
[0:26:18] <%Dopamien> I am 2 dimensional calebSadge
[0:26:19] <+raideyroo> Mmm-mmm that's some good taint
[0:26:19] <%cvp5127> does 5 mention it?
[0:26:21] <Finaldragoon> I liked the twist, people who hated the twist in 3 are fucking cowards and fuck tri-Ace for never exploring that twist further
[0:26:22] <heartlesshealer> THAT'S WORSE
[0:26:23] <%RealThiele> big taint
[0:26:24] <Psyramics> is his motivation "break free from this MMO nonsense"?
[0:26:26] <%Frost_Quill> @blackjack8182 Everyone in .hack knows they're playing an MMO.
[0:26:26] <%tusk102> none of it matters
[0:26:26] <%justcallmebobplease> It's so weird for me, since Till the End of Time was my first Star Ocean game - it was 'normal' to me that Star Ocean's setting worked this way.
[0:26:30] <pet_purple_panda> so... not Warframew
[0:26:31] <tanarath> !uptime
[0:26:31] <@Moobot> @tanarath I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 26m 51s.
[0:26:33] <+drakthebest> Reminder that Outer Wilds DLC releases on the 28th of September
[0:26:33] <+bugz_munny> fuckin pso2 did that
[0:26:34] <+BigBruthaThunda> 5 dimensional taint
[0:26:35] <%superc37> so the eva rebuilds
[0:26:35] <dd44dostivei> the elder scrolls are literally the video games
[0:26:35] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt The main BBEG of SO4 is literally just an MMo Event
[0:26:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> oh. that's lame. the idea was neat in concept tho
[0:26:37] <%RealThiele> nothing you did mattered
[0:26:40] <%Monkeyweed21> The 5th dimensional beings are just humans btw
[0:26:41] <@SSaryn> At least with PSO2 you still fight cool shit fuck
[0:26:41] <pet_purple_panda> cause thats sounds like warframe
[0:26:43] <knight_verse> It's basically the Woolie ending.
[0:26:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @tusk102 I mean that to but its also used to describe our physical state
[0:26:45] <%justcallmebobplease> THE PROGRAMMER WAS EVEN CALLED NOT!LUCIFER
[0:26:45] <kikoeru_san> Is he an otaku
[0:26:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[0:26:52] <turboyabo> so its like a star space dudes pc
[0:26:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Shut up thats so dumb!
[0:26:54] <%Solid_Stro> And everything you did up into that point didn’t matter
[0:26:55] <%justcallmebobplease> That's how hamfisted Star Ocean's nonsense was.
[0:26:55] <%MajorCrasher> oh so the DRV3
[0:26:57] <+ZephynM> I would have picked up Death Loop, if I hadn't fallen for the Apex Legends trap when I saw stuff I liked.
[0:26:59] <Jrocy247> SO4 drained my soul
[0:26:59] <%YakumoYomi> You go through the Firewall into "4D Space", and come out in an amusement park/
[0:26:59] <pet_purple_panda> Korean DmC
[0:27:00] <%Dakuu75> but, is it better than Cyberpunk?
[0:27:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> the Chinese one
[0:27:01] <%cooldude69xx> Can you think of a worst twist? Like say you really dont want people to like Thing anymore, what would you do do one up Star Ocean 3?
[0:27:01] <%baphometseinfeld> The trailers for this game were all weird and the same thing 5 times
[0:27:02] <@SSaryn> A lot of people still really like the 60s mod aesthetic and got exactly that with Deahtloop.
[0:27:07] <%asgard147> Can't they just reboot the fanchise? I miss Star Oceon limesFeels
[0:27:08] <%tortugatime214> So it’s mass effect 3?
[0:27:22] <%ZeludeRose> ZeludeRose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! you shit on peanut butter & honey a few days ago so i tried it, GOOD SHIT, btw did you ever google soggy biscuit
[0:27:27] <brexdq> lost soul aside is going to be so good
[0:27:32] <Loving_Fox> It isn't a mmo for 5d being it is just a simulation. They used that wording to describe it
[0:27:36] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> @PatStaresAt Lost Soul Aside's that one character action game that was being made by one dude. He's got a team now I believe
[0:27:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> people summon primals because problems
[0:27:40] <turboyabo> when you say 5th dimension all i can think is alien x playing a mmo
[0:27:48] <kazadaz> Beaucoup aether
[0:27:53] <+Brightstreak> what are we talking aboit?
[0:27:54] <%CzeekyTV> Isn't Silvertear now basically a hole leading to Hydaelyn
[0:27:55] <%RealThiele> just shit out that aether
[0:27:57] <kikoeru_san> bro what the fuck are you talking about?
[0:27:57] <jumpyhugs> Man I bet this game's NEVER comin out Kappa LUL
[0:28:01] <%asgard147> Like what Greg did?
[0:28:01] <+BIumen> oh, land of gods
[0:28:02] <%VioletHeart> Along with the corrupted aether as a result of Bahamut, shit's fucked in Eorzea.
[0:28:05] <%shurtal> don't forget the Burn
[0:28:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the only good part of the SO3 twist is that everyone in the "real world" thinks your party are a bunch of loser cosplayers
[0:28:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> ff14 is an mmo for climate change
[0:28:10] <TheresAGoff> Is Primals are Cimate Change?
[0:28:10] <%WhereIsWill> just call some friends over, focus a bit, and BOOM, free Bahamut
[0:28:11] <+bugz_munny> We take the toxic waste and SUMMON GODS
[0:28:12] <%Dakuu75> omg... Primals are just that nega Captain Planet...
[0:28:12] <%rekinom> Which version of star ocean 2 should I play?
[0:28:13] <kikoeru_san> NO
[0:28:14] <Psyramics> eorzean tribes still gotta truck in crystals to summon their primals. they make a point of this in the early game with Ifrit
[0:28:16] <$dalmek> greenhouse gases provide the catalyst for summoning shit huh
[0:28:16] <wolfen091> if only our pollution problems summoned monsters
[0:28:16] <+Brightstreak> ah gotcha, thank you
[0:28:17] <zerointelligence000> tbf, a lot of beast tribes summon primals because they have no other choice and their lives are fucked
[0:28:17] <%Mr_Pylon> sounds like they need Captain Planet
[0:28:18] <@SSaryn> Although uh, don't right now.
[0:28:19] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Wait, FFXIV has good lore?

[0:31:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> FUCK EPIC NEVER BUYING ANYONE WHO DOES A DEAL WITH THEM
[0:31:43] <Finakala> Might pick Deathloop up soon actually
[0:31:43] <%dekkitout> And here I thought the title was Darkest Dungeon Too SeriousSloth
[0:31:44] <Rionxgarland> i boughtdeathloop on pc :(
[0:31:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> darkest dungeon is the best game that gives me anxiety attacks to play!
[0:31:53] <SaltyAzteca> Man, I cant beat DD1, I dont have the fortitude
[0:31:56] <%RealThiele> Cthulu shit also not under copyright law for the most part so im excited to see what they do
[0:31:57] <%epide> @SuckerPunchSyd lol ikr i liked the game 2
[0:32:00] <devanmuse> Is there a name for this game's kind of multiplayer integration other than "Invasion"? And can you think of any other games that would benefit from a system like that?
[0:32:06] <digaogrunge> DD2 GOTY 2021
[0:32:11] <nabs96> @patstaresat Why buy Darkest Dungeon 2 on steam again if u already own it on Epic tho? just curious
[0:32:12] <%hewlettfan96> Hades is a phenomenal game
[0:32:12] <%JoshManVGH> Woolie will be buying it day one, I imagine. Any DD marks will be
[0:32:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> pasta ras et

[0:32:31] <Sol_Install> yep
[0:32:34] <ReaversEdge45> Still stuck in that deathloop called 2020
[0:32:34] <T_Sasquatch> No joke 90% of the streamers I follow are playing it ironically
[0:32:37] <valriot> The advertising was completely wrong LUL
[0:32:41] <%boxboten> its amazing how bad the ad campaign was
[0:32:44] <%FacetiousAF> the trailers were garbage, game looks hype
[0:32:49] <karatetape> !uptime
[0:32:49] <@Moobot> @karatetape I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 33m 9s.
[0:32:50] <scrumbotime> Thanks to seeing streams of this I want to dive right the fuck into it, vs from just the ads going "eh, ok, maybe some time??"
[0:32:50] <%FacetiousAF> DO NOT
[0:32:50] <%dekkitout> @devanmuse By concept, invasion is the best name
[0:32:51] <@ssjklyco> I actually confused it with Operation Tango
[0:32:51] <T_Sasquatch> Also they aren't all being sponsored
[0:32:54] <+Brightstreak> I'm really put off by the art style. Thoughts on the art style?
[0:32:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Yeah the advertising is what killed this game for me LUL
[0:32:56] <%FacetiousAF> do not google that.
[0:32:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Makes me optimistic for positions opening in the Marketing field
[0:32:58] <BliVru> Limes seemed to like it
[0:32:59] <%AkronymCLT> I didn't realise it could be played single player until literally today
[0:33:00] <DSD24> How do play something ironically
[0:33:02] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> It's like hot brownie or icky cookie
[0:33:02] <blackjack8182> I heard this game has a shitty two power limit.
[0:33:02] <%Bailey__gaming> I dont want this game because of how often it was shown and im like no i wont play that
[0:33:06] <%CzeekyTV> I still don't actually understand what Deathloop is. Is it multiplayer only? or does it have a single player component
[0:33:09] <+vaderxyz1970> Bagle with peanut butter and honey is amazing
[0:33:09] <%epide> @SuckerPunchSyd lol its a truper ill get it working againits like the 57th time
[0:33:11] <%MidnightBurst12> smart man
[0:33:12] <heartlesshealer> if Paige told you not to, you know it's in a fanfic
[0:33:12] <+Delenay> ad guys mustn have believed in the cool shit the game does
[0:33:13] <Zeif00> Cast the Paige Signal
[0:33:13] <Sunstalker> Paige protects the children
[0:33:18] <RyuuAoi> Yeah I've NEVER heard of this game until you or Woolie talked about it. Or Kojima.
[0:33:21] <zerointelligence000> Pat explaining the game this stream was more informative than all the trailers combined
[0:33:23] <DSD24> @CzeekyTV Its got a single player story
[0:33:26] <%RealThiele> paige stuck in the twitter realm
[0:33:27] <%baka_sugoi> W E T
[0:33:29] <%JoshManVGH> DeathLoops best version is also banished to a console nobody can get their hands on! This game is gonna have a dire launch.
[0:33:29] <+mechslayer71> it's single player with invasions
[0:33:30] <%Dopamien> the honey dries
[0:33:31] <Meekest> Wet Ass Psandwich
[0:33:31] <%Dakuu75> I'm with Pat on that one
[0:33:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> what
[0:33:33] <%tusk102> i love that the dark knight quest is just your self esteem calling you a bitch for doing what everyone tells you
[0:33:34] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 Okay Pat hear me out. It's Always Sunny on Deep Space Nine. The Gang runs the bar on the DS9 station. Danny DeVito as a Ferengi.
[0:33:34] <%dekkitout> Depends on the pb really
[0:33:34] <mrshazboto> Crunchy Peanut Butter and Honey
[0:33:34] <@ssjklyco> Peanut butter is barely wet
[0:33:35] <+BIumen> is this sandwich creepy or wet?
[0:33:35] <%WhereIsWill> wet sandwitch WutFace
[0:33:36] <Treasure_Vault> Honey is kind of dry
[0:33:37] <Blank9> everything I've seen of the game makes me think it's an assassin's creed multiplayer game mode
[0:33:39] <vennythecheese> its not about dryness it's about the flavor combo
[0:33:39] <Maids4lyfe> @CzeekyTV it's single player with only one player invading to kill you among countless AI enemies
[0:33:39] <%stubborndeer> peanut butter and honey dipping in NUTELLA
[0:33:39] <RyuuAoi> Google soggy biscuit though...
[0:33:40] <%AJ_Cherenkov> I'm the weirdo who has just peanut butter
[0:33:43] <%Rumbutt> how does HONEY make it wet wtf kinda honey you got
[0:33:43] <+ALazo> too moist even
[0:33:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @epide ah thats good lol but no more deathloop for it
[0:33:43] <%linSP> my brownie fell in my spaghetti sauce, should I still eat it
[0:33:47] <%spitelite> use less honey?
[0:33:49] <%Order_of_Mystery> how about peanut butter on pepperoni pizza @PatStaresAt
[0:33:51] <%RealThiele> use a non-shit bread
[0:33:52] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> makes dry peanut better
[0:33:53] <SaltyAzteca> Awwwwww
[0:33:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Honey is not too wet
[0:33:53] <+aaymon86> Honey isn't that wet I think.

[0:34:25] <+Ynkubus_> LUL
[0:34:26] <scrumbotime> Tbh when it comes to BG3 and Pathfinder I'd suggest just reading the core books if you have the time, to understand the systems before they get filtered into game.
[0:34:26] <Archmortal> Turn your difficulty down too, fucker.  No one cares, it's fine
[0:34:26] <DSD24> Pathfinder is really fun to make characters though
[0:34:26] <nevan_44> LUL
[0:34:26] <+FemmeAndroid> That’s a good call
[0:34:27] <peyodogo> GOBLINS BEGONE

[0:34:34] <mikeriffic> Just play the game pat
[0:34:34] <+aaymon86> ..... True
[0:34:34] <%Dakuu75> I don't think that's the guides though, buddy...
[0:34:34] <+FemmeAndroid> At least for new games.
[0:34:35] <@PeachSaliva> Seriously, it makes him lose his fucking mind.
[0:34:35] <%Cerabret100> good for her, gotta assert the dominance now
[0:34:36] <tanarath> @peachsaliva Good, thanks for helping.
[0:34:36] <+bigslinglelino> Guess youll never be able to play path of exile again
[0:34:37] <%nicoleymcquack> i mean that’s very fair
[0:34:38] <@PeachSaliva> I had literally no choice.
[0:34:38] <%JoshManVGH> Ok yeah that makes sense.
[0:34:38] <DSD24> @tusk102 Yeah Pat streamed the pathfinder game
[0:34:38] <@Spydurman> @PeachSaliva how bad was it?
[0:34:39] <BliVru> Daz a good waifu
[0:34:39] <%boxboten> honestly pat most modern CRPGs have learned that trap builds fucking suck
[0:34:40] <Gorshum> Good work Paige!
[0:34:40] <$sleepystardewfarmer> btw you said you can throw cereal in the toilet right? I started doing it, and I just wanted to let you know, according to google, cereal can expand and clog your toilet :/ unfortunate
[0:34:40] <mikeriffic> as in pathfinder
[0:34:40] <+TheAdMerlin> Just play on a low difficulty and roleplay the patquisitor!
[0:34:41] <Meekest> WEDDING AT RISK
[0:34:42] <@ssjklyco> Did she say that while eating pineapple?
[0:34:42] <%hewlettfan96> Oh damn Paige what have you done
[0:34:42] <%Ipsenscastle> She's gonna storm downstairs now to rant at us
[0:34:42] <@PeachSaliva> I would never otherwise forbid him from stuff.
[0:34:43] <ExpressNode> What doesn't make you crazy?
[0:34:43] <jorniev> CRAZIER
[0:34:43] <%dekkitout> That's a pretty big commitment, you gonna be okay?
[0:34:44] <mikeriffic> no guides
[0:34:45] <RyuuAoi> Pat, when you eat a burger, you order a sprite/beer to wash it down. No dry sandwich!
[0:34:45] <%jinking79> that is Correct
[0:34:46] <%MidnightBurst12> moping?
[0:34:46] <@PeachSaliva> So I apologize.
[0:34:46] <mikeriffic> fitfo

[0:34:49] <%WhereIsWill> psaGoblin SLAIN psaGoblin
[0:34:50] <ammobasket> Time to look down them
[0:34:52] <zerointelligence000> I love the image of Pat complaining about optimal builds over a nice candle-light dinner
[0:34:52] <%JoshManVGH> She's beating up your goblins for you, that's sweet.
[0:34:53] <+Mrbaconator> not playing pathinder with a guide is insane
[0:34:54] <JetpackMcQuack> plans are for nerds
[0:34:54] <@PeachSaliva> A LITTLE?!
[0:34:55] <%baka_sugoi> BABY
[0:34:57] <%PocketBearIllustrator> oh hai @peachsaliva
[0:34:58] <+vaderxyz1970> Just make one character for everyclass till you get it right
[0:35:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> No worries paige!
[0:35:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Build guides are just suggestions not hard and fast rules
[0:35:02] <SaltyAzteca> Banned it to save him, Paige is a good wife
[0:35:02] <%nicoleymcquack> no it’s FAIR
[0:35:04] <%tusk102> she's fighting your goblins
[0:35:04] <goroke> A LITTLE SHE SAYS
[0:35:04] <%hewlettfan96> That’s absolutely a huge commitment though
[0:35:04] <@Spydurman> did you stomp your feet and cry?
[0:35:06] <RyuuAoi> @peachsaliva Show him soggy biscuit

[0:35:12] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That makes complete sense
[0:35:14] <Jrocy247> Okay Pat, you can also Ban her from eating Pinapple to close the deal
[0:35:14] <digaogrunge> Just learn D&D Pat, all it takes is 3 books
[0:35:16] <Archmortal> have you also managed to slay the mind goblin of developers of old games shaming you about lower difficulty settings
[0:35:16] <%Order_of_Mystery> my wife made me choose between her and the build guides. god I miss her
[0:35:16] <%Pachi3000> psaFist psaWhat
[0:35:17] <MrPandastic> But what if your build sucks?

[0:35:32] <TheLocalRival> Pat was Upsetti that he couldn’t eat his moms spaghetti Kappa
[0:35:40] <@SSaryn> You're gonna shrivel half way into Pathfinder I hope you know that.
[0:35:40] <churropoppa> bro there's a playlist on youtube on learning pathfinder basics and it's 13 hours long. That's like a fucking college course. LUL
[0:35:42] <%Pachi3000> angy
[0:35:43] <%FemmeAndroid> FemmeAndroid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Thank you Paige for mandating the build guide ban!
[0:35:46] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Pat loves to yell at his woman Kappa
[0:35:51] <+Mrbaconator> i am a multi year veteran of pathfinder i absolutely still use a guide for many classes

[0:36:55] <%greasypete00> The neurodivergent part or using that as an excuse to get out of blame

[0:37:13] <@SSaryn> "A relatively new term, neurodivergent simply means someone who thinks differently from the way the majority (referred to as neurotypical) expect. Neurotypical means the opposite –someone whose brain behaves in the same way as the majority of society."

[0:37:20] <RubberFistFight> @Teyaric Eh, neurodivergence is a thing - it's just been diluted into meaninglessness as a term by misuse and misappropriation.

[0:38:37] <%blastyoboots> Saying "I'm sorry, I'm trying my best to fight issues exacerbated by my neurodivergence" is very different from "lol it's not my fault cause I'm neurodivergent" they're two VERY different attitudes
[0:38:38] <Sol_Install> PRIME EXAMPLE
[0:38:39] <%SpcOpsBear> I'm neurodivergent Pat and the exact situation you describe -is- funny, just THINK before you tell a joke like that again because without context that take was nuclear.

[1:17:10] <%darklordfodder> Baby pushing muscles and shitting muscles are basically the same muscles.
[1:17:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Haptic feedback?
[1:17:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> feedback
[1:17:15] <%MidnightBurst12> I love this guy already
[1:17:15] <dukenux> Is Deathloop another Strand-type of game
[1:17:16] <+raideyroo> I believe she only appears once per Loop
[1:17:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh fuck that

[1:17:23] <Parapattern> Is that distracting?
[1:17:24] <ChungusQuest> hmmm

[1:17:25] <GrandmasterBFunk> I have had no stuttering on PC?
[1:17:25] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Where is the I got you babe song
[1:17:26] <%valerios_> huh
[1:17:27] <+mechslayer71> it doesn't stutter that much for me on PC. ending v sync in controller panel helps
[1:17:28] <+CostumedJoe> I'm here for the start if one of these for once :)

[1:17:36] <EndoMills> that seems like its gonna be annoying
[1:17:37] <%Order_of_Mystery> haptic feedback is still legit, nice
[1:17:39] <MrChaosDoughnut> That's an interesting idea.
[1:17:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt bionicles are a good mix between legos building stuff and "not destroying my feet when i step on them"
[1:17:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I have a PS5 remote, i have no PS5,  i have a dream
[1:17:48] <%spitelite> is the angled health bar bothering anyone else

[1:23:04] <%Monkeyweed21> I like how pat is already missing ammo pickups
[1:23:04] <%polothegreatest> LUL, now i get the dino context LUL
[1:23:06] <%Raikouija> Time for murder
[1:23:07] <Man_in_the_Red> Kill them all Patrick, kill them all
[1:23:10] <SaltyAzteca> GOOD, Cuz I hate kill penalties
[1:23:10] <+megaotter> if you die when your wang is out, you die in reallife
[1:23:10] <+RyanTheRecluse> all you need is kill
[1:23:10] <oddbunker> so pacifist run when?
[1:23:11] <%dekkitout> I thought the trailers were cool
[1:23:12] <+CostumedJoe> the scorch marks they leave behind can be detected btw
[1:23:13] <PanicSwytch> Is there a skill tree?
[1:23:13] <%darklordfodder> it's not Non-LethaltakedownLoop
[1:23:14] <$floralkami> @treasure_vault no, you literally weren't paying attention
[1:23:15] <+raideyroo> No non-lethal in this game <3
[1:23:15] <BlackStarAura> pretty
[1:23:19] <T_Sasquatch> I thought the trailers were fine tbh
[1:23:22] <%blue8moon> because they were trying to prove that the game was cool
[1:23:22] <%CatastropheCorvid> Sooo, this is DishonouredCrash?
[1:23:23] <kazadaz> Most irritating meme
[1:23:27] <%BestTeaMaker> pat you missed a thing
[1:23:31] <42nfl19> So what is the Immersive Sim part if all you do is kill?
[1:23:33] <%twistedj3ster> why can't he remember if he's going to remember things next loop?
[1:23:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> is it ok because they'll be back though? is this 12 minutes over again
[1:23:35] <%SWFanatic> Oh
[1:23:39] <%Ashrox117> I think the first trailer I ever saw for it was what interested me most
[1:23:39] <dukenux> Remember Colt, Lethal Takedown is the most silent takedown
[1:23:44] <a_mad_dragon_> that health bar looks like a detection notice though
[1:23:45] <$floralkami> bruh all of y'all just now figuring out the game is cool LITERALLY didn't pay attention to the trailers
[1:23:45] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Does this game have GOTY potential
[1:23:49] <%sonofthedeepsouth> paige yes
[1:23:49] <%RayReborne> this game has always been cool, just too much exposure. but ok, maybe I'll get this now
[1:23:53] <%RealThiele> paige big weeds
[1:23:53] <LorcaNomad> that's REALLY cool
[1:23:53] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Paige can only read sounds or text, not both
[1:23:54] <%Treuan> Sword Swingin' Streetfighter
[1:23:56] <%emperordread> oh cool, Sniper Eliete does that too
[1:23:58] <knight_verse> Those words are Pat's mind goblins telling him to kill.
[1:24:03] <RyuuAoi> I have absolutely no idea what this game is so this is an experience for sure
[1:24:03] <$realm_forge> Paige brain go snert
[1:24:05] <%Raikouija> Is pat online right now? will he be invaded?
[1:24:05] <jorniev> are they talking about you?
[1:24:11] <Heyestus> she says surrounded by grass
[1:24:11] <Visorak6> THERES GRASS RIGHT THERE
[1:24:15] <$floralkami> ALL of this was showed and explained TO DEATH in the trailers
[1:24:16] <%skizzuto> but there's grass, that's a plant
[1:24:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> you just walked through plants

[1:25:16] <%darklordfodder> Dishonored discourages killing
[1:25:21] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[1:25:26] <DSD24> Colt seems cool

[1:29:47] <%blistexthief> This voice actor is great
[1:29:49] <EndoMills> i have a feeling that was a end-game cutscene moment if you inverted it
[1:29:49] <stormhawk9891> Colt's a dumbass, he's great
[1:29:50] <%TOONFOOD> im never trusting floating text again
[1:29:50] <+teh_rawk> there should be a todd howard postcard that says "dont trust his lies"
[1:29:51] <42nfl19> wow this game cheats, you can't have a deathless run
[1:29:52] <%chiazam> I love time loops where you start in the middle of the time loops and not the beginning
[1:29:52] <MasterTonberry23> I was one of the haters and now I am 100% on board
[1:29:55] <T_Sasquatch> I feel like i blinked.  Why is he able to interact with himself
[1:29:55] <%tusk102> i love that he isnt just taking it in stride like a lot of protagonists
[1:29:55] <%AncelDeLambert> we'll see with the writing, it hasn't lost me yet
[1:29:56] <ChungusQuest> Okay campers, rise and shine!
[1:30:00] <%hewlettfan96> This voice actor is amazing
[1:30:00] <%Ipsenscastle> @RadioSpirit for real
[1:30:01] <+CTMathiu> I like time loop/time travel stories like this.
[1:30:02] <%AncelDeLambert> although I STILL HATE THAT ACTION SLIDE
[1:30:04] <%SWFanatic> this game is worth it just for the voice acting
[1:30:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> About how long ago did Pat start?
[1:30:08] <%Raikouija> I guess it took AAA studios long enough to make stories with Rougelites like this game and Returnal eh???
[1:30:08] <Jontman42> this seems soooo much more interesting than Dishonored did to me
[1:30:09] <circular7> this is the Time travel story I've seen in a long while so far

[1:37:01] <%Nobrev> @MasterTonberry23 it's always swordfish
[1:37:01] <DSD24> This text in game thing reminds me of Splitner Cell Conviction
[1:37:07] <+0dinpen> Is there a world timer that makes you loop?
[1:37:08] <%Aeoneth> like 2000 times and everntually you get the right one
[1:37:10] <+The_Death_Owl> the password is password tiffosZeldaShrug

[1:37:19] <MasterTonberry23> @DSD24 RIP Splinter Cell
[1:37:22] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I wasn't really interested in this game, but if Arkhane made this then maybe I will
[1:37:24] <Man_in_the_Red> @bailey__gaming loud
[1:37:24] <%bravebravesrobin> Wow, it seems insane to me that this got bad press...
[1:37:33] <%tusk102> do they have painted faces or are they weird masks
[1:37:34] <DSD24> @MasterTonberry23 Oh man its super dead
[1:37:36] <%dekkitout> Guns named after swords are neato
[1:37:37] <%HotSauceFiend> why did this get bad press?
[1:37:38] <+Nero_Cross> @Bailey__gaming Nope, gun good, entirely up to player choice
[1:37:41] <Kingsgrave_> do they ever explain why everyone is wearing masks
[1:37:42] <%sirisvirus> man the fact the bodies just disappear is great
[1:37:47] <%FrootusClopootus> it's like they're dying in the fortnight game
[1:37:49] <%RealThiele> the advertising firm that made those ads needs big fired
[1:37:51] <BurdRightsActivist> THE ROOM
[1:37:56] <+MoroseLoki> This game got press?
[1:37:58] <MasterTonberry23> @Kingsgrave_ so they dont have to animate faces Kappa
[1:38:03] <+The_Death_Owl> it only got bad press because people were tired of seeing it at showcases
[1:38:04] <%anAngryHamster> FUCK YEAH Name your guns after swords
[1:38:06] <%darklordfodder> I don't feel like the press has been bad, reviews have been mostly positive.
[1:38:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> @hotsaucefiend cauae nobody ever saw the gameplay
[1:38:20] <+BlueLeopard007> bad press? its had great reviews, just terrible ad campaign
[1:38:25] <%Bailey__gaming> does loud matter if there is no non lethal
[1:38:29] <%BioHunter> BioHunter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:38:32] <MasterTonberry23> The actual press was all positive, people hated on it for the overexposure
[1:38:34] <%blastyoboots> SHINYT
[1:38:38] <jorniev> WAIT EVERYONE IS ON YHE LOOP?
[1:38:38] <%blastyoboots> shiny on the mantle
[1:38:39] <Kingsgrave_> I dont blame Arkane for advertising this game as much as they did given how poorly their last few games did sales wise
[1:38:48] <Kingsgrave_> they make great games that people just dont buy for whatever reason
[1:38:49] <%justcallmebobplease> What was that shiny on the mantle?
[1:38:54] <%tusk102> @Bailey__gaming loud makes more enemies attack at once so you die faster, thats about it
[1:38:54] <DSD24> I wonder if Colt has a cool apartment
[1:38:57] <+The_Death_Owl> I literally don't remember seeing an ad for prey
[1:38:57] <GrandmasterBFunk> @Bailey__gaming They call in more reinforcements if you go loud
[1:38:58] <%blastyoboots> wh.... wha?
[1:39:07] <+yungkame> well now im worrying about it
[1:39:13] <boogz____> Just tuned in how does the game feel so far?
[1:39:19] <DSD24> This is pretty nice
[1:39:20] <%tusk102> KILL EVERY MOTHERFUCKER
[1:39:22] <%ape_hawk> kill them all peter, i mean colt
[1:39:23] <stormhawk9891> BEST GUN
[1:39:24] <%polothegreatest> it gave the impression of PVP ONLY for the ads. psaBlep
[1:39:27] <+the_mega_guy_> NAIL GUN vesperPog
[1:39:28] <%Raikouija> *whistles*
[1:39:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Kill them all Peter
[1:39:31] <Kingsgrave_> I didnt even know Dishonored 2 had DLC until like over a year later
[1:39:33] <%RealThiele> game is very much dishonored mixed with a roguelite aspect
[1:39:35] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He sure is cavalier about killing
[1:39:37] <+fetrigon> is the map an open world or instanced?
[1:39:37] <%bravebravesrobin> yeah, I was talking pre-launch.  maybe a strategy to lessen expectations then knock it out of the park?  But with how good this is, seems stupid
[1:39:38] <jorniev> NAILED IT
[1:39:43] <%anAngryHamster> RIP Trevor
[1:39:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> So instead of chaos and order we got quiet and loud

[1:43:52] <%Raikouija> neat!
[1:43:54] <+yungkame> its so funny that their bodies just go away. the game is actively anti stealth

[1:45:45] <DSD24> Aww that sounds like a bummer
[1:45:56] <$floralkami> it seems some people keep their memories, but only bits of it
[1:45:56] <Ner234> D: the nuts
[1:46:13] <$floralkami> probably depends on the person and what they did
[1:46:15] <vennythecheese> too much noise jesus. Will games every get recordings right?
[1:46:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> big badaboom
[1:46:38] <MayorRev> Is there a clock / alarm system in this game?
[1:46:41] <%Wallabri> hi emlo
[1:46:44] <%CapnBeefs> So is this an open world?
[1:46:56] <kazadaz> Yeah who would put a firework-making machine near the place where fireworks are made?
[1:46:57] <+Nero_Cross> @CapnBeefs Hubs
[1:47:02] <+SpoopySkeletman> @vennythecheese it's because of all those 5G waves LUL
[1:47:07] <Cajjunb> this reminds me of bioshock

[1:48:07] <+BlueLeopard007> interesting...
[1:48:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is a very silly looking game
[1:48:15] <SilverFaustX> the switch got a big update
[1:48:16] <DSD24> Far Cry 2 was cool
[1:48:19] <MayorRev> I mean, Fallout had jamming and everyone loved that
[1:48:19] <%hewlettfan96> This looks like a great game to speed@through
[1:48:19] <+vaderxyz1970> What is this Synthetic?
[1:48:23] <%nanaki_ff14> Yea I want to see if you can do a straight new game no deaths kill every boss or if thats not possible
[1:48:24] <%Raikouija> people sure this game isnt a rougelike?
[1:48:25] <jorniev> what?
[1:48:25] <MasterTonberry23> @xcompleasedad yeah your mom. heyoooo
[1:48:31] <%PyroOptional> is from the same people who made Dishonored? feels really similar.

[1:49:16] <SilverFaustX> new fw
[1:49:17] <MasterTonberry23> For everyone that doesnt know, this game was made by the same devs as Dishonored. (five minutes later) "Hey why does this game look like Dishonored?"
[1:49:20] <+Shady_Zaku> The NUMBERS Mason, WHAT DO THEY MEEAN
[1:49:20] <+JaseAdrift> lol not a quiet gun
[1:49:22] <Cruven_gladomain> They're on the walls.

[1:49:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat knows things
[1:49:24] <MayorRev> HL2 death sound
[1:49:27] <%toolofparanoia> THE NUMBERS, PATRICK WHAT DO THEY MEAN
[1:49:35] <thatdudenamedlogan> @hewlettfan96 I think this actually looks nightmarish to speedrun considering Julianna is a PC.
[1:49:42] <%Raikouija> welp
[1:49:43] <maybefalco> LUL
[1:49:47] <kazadaz> "Is X a roguelike" is about as worthwhile as shit like "would napoleon be a griffindore?"
[1:49:48] <%nanaki_ff14> DO ET
[1:49:50] <Madinki> @MasterTonberry23 It's so annoying....
[1:49:51] <MayorRev> That's very reminiscent of roadhogs reload
[1:49:51] <%nanaki_ff14> BOOM
[1:49:52] <SkeletonTown> reload just by dumping some shit in it its great
[1:49:53] <Man_in_the_Red> there are very few roguelikes since most arent grid based dungeon crawlers
[1:49:56] <+Nero_Cross> @hewlettfan96 there's an offline mode
[1:50:02] <LoneFonte> @hewlettfan96 i mean, you can just disable that.
[1:50:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> well
[1:50:12] <DSD24> We found "A Colt"?
[1:50:13] <%Raikouija> F
[1:50:13] <+TheIndigoLlama> there's a different reload for the spiker where Colt just throws a bunch in and some fall, the reload isn't even a full one because of it LUL
[1:50:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> you think
[1:50:16] <Crownaux0> gg
[1:50:17] <%CzeekyTV> nice toss

[1:50:20] <thatdudenamedlogan> Oh, I had no idea.
[1:50:20] <Man_in_the_Red> so i'll say this first person shooter is not a similar to rogue

[1:50:21] <%Raikouija> I LIVE BITCH
[1:50:22] <%linSP> yooooo its rewind time

[1:50:32] <%tusk102> OOF
[1:50:32] <thatdudenamedlogan> I honestly thought that was just a Dark Souls part of the game.

[1:50:33] <%toolofparanoia> haaaaay
[1:50:35] <%nanaki_ff14> christ
[1:50:35] <DSD24> Oh shit
[1:50:35] <MasterTonberry23> Okay if anyone asks why this game looks like Dishonored, tell people that the Dishonored devs are suing. Let's see if we can get that started LUL
[1:50:36] <%Mattais88> Tracer?
[1:50:37] <scrumbotime> OH GOD that was a neck snap

[1:51:04] <%hewlettfan96> @lonefonte Disable what??
[1:51:06] <thatdudenamedlogan> I thought Julianna was a built in part of the game
[1:51:10] <thatdudenamedlogan> I didn't realize you could turn that off
[1:51:12] <DSD24> Pat has future knowledge
[1:51:15] <%redthebaron> important numbers is the guess
[1:51:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> yes
[1:51:21] <%hewlettfan96> That neck snap was brutal
[1:51:33] <%IamGrapes> not really but go on...
[1:51:36] <$floralkami> @thatdudenamedlogan you can turn off the invasion aspect, but her AI still runs around
[1:51:36] <sweenicus> the health bar...why does this studio hate my brain

[1:52:55] <AdmiralButtloaf> wrong input
[1:52:56] <%blastyoboots> you mistyped it as 302

[1:54:49] <$floralkami> @digimonda same time period, so good
[1:54:52] <+Nomenanza> I think deluxe edition even gives you a tux
[1:54:58] <%hereiam407> 'Don't mention Xbox live to them'
[1:54:59] <Psyramics> you just thought about The Game
[1:54:59] <+broaches> there's a note next to the hack
[1:55:00] <%nanaki_ff14> This actually looks very satifying
[1:55:03] <dukenux> man, of all games NOLF could probably use a remaster the most
[1:55:14] <Visorak6> Is that weird structure in the distance the control center?
[1:55:17] <Mnemonicjohnny> Fair 'nuff
[1:55:17] <Psyramics> does the loop have a hard cut-off or is it just when you die?
[1:55:18] <%hereiam407> I've heard this game is very satisfying
[1:55:35] <%dekkitout> So many knowledge
[1:55:36] <$floralkami> @psyramics after dying times
[1:55:39] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Looks like you only got one of those tho?
[1:55:39] <mrshazboto> Unrelated - just finished WoD and wow...that fuckin raid was gold
[1:55:40] <%twistedj3ster> WOW YOU HAVE TO CONNECT ONLINE EACH LEVEL
[1:55:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Oh nvm
[1:55:49] <%stubborndeer> IF you have OCD this game is literally Crack cocaine
[1:55:52] <tanarath> 3 times
[1:55:55] <%Mattais88> Colt need like 200 more beard
[1:55:58] <%stubborndeer> because it can go on forever AND end
[1:56:01] <%Dakuu75> this is starting to look complicated
[1:56:01] <%twistedj3ster> oh
[1:56:02] <Treasure_Vault> I'm curious to see the -lite part of this roguelite, but I also know Pat is way too good to die
[1:56:04] <%hereiam407> Those online PvP enemies must be tough
[1:56:04] <Visorak6> This game has a good interface
[1:56:21] <%hereiam407> Fantastic, perfect
[1:56:22] <%SpoonheadInExile> I'm flabbergasted that CanIRunIt gave it's blessing to my outdated rig for this game
[1:56:26] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Are codes scrambled for every playthrough? But kept for loop?
[1:56:36] <%nanaki_ff14> When DS players learn FPS controls
[1:56:49] <+SirSamVimes> @Treasure_Vault even if you don't die, reaching the end of the day resets the loop too
[1:56:53] <plughead_> it feels like the audio's like coming out after each other a bit too fast
[1:57:06] <SaltyAzteca> unique codes are excellent
[1:57:06] <IntenseNerdRage> The Tunnels Mason!  Where do they go?!
[1:57:07] <+JaseAdrift> Cant wait to see the Dishonored speedrunners running around killing players
[1:57:09] <%Bailey__gaming> Tunnel Snakes Rule
[1:57:10] <Dunmarkh> death stranding.
[1:57:15] <%cooldude69xx> @Treasure_Vault Pat would NEVER die in this game
[1:57:23] <GilliamYaeger> LOUD AND PROUD
[1:57:26] <+Nero_Cross> @Treasure_Vault It's not a roguelite any more than Majora's mask is a roguelite
[1:57:26] <%stubborndeer> this was the point I felt like someone else left that message
[1:57:29] <%SpoonheadInExile> StealthGamerBR will do wonders with this
[1:57:31] <%hereiam407> Ambient feel looks good
[1:57:35] <Virokwet> cool gun
[1:57:37] <+WeLucklessJacks> LOUD AND PROUD
[1:57:41] <%Dakuu75> What are these floating words? is that game-stuff or tutorial stuff?
[1:57:43] <thatdudenamedlogan> I do like how this game makes you hurry the fuck up.
[1:57:50] <%SpoonheadInExile> @Nero_Cross Thank God
[1:57:51] <%cooldude69xx> @Treasure_Vault That sounds like a roguelite to me
[1:57:56] <thatdudenamedlogan> Dishonored felt leisurely at times, though I loved those games.
[1:58:05] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt How's the game running for you? Apparently there's a ton of negative reviews just for the DRM.
[1:58:07] <%asgard147> psaDogchamp I will follow Mom
[1:58:11] <atsu333> Just tuned in, how's the performance been so far?
[1:58:12] <%stubborndeer> @Dakuu75 If pay plays about 3 hours of this it will be explained
[1:58:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That fucking alien wooooOoOOooOoO LUL
[1:58:26] <Dunmarkh> @Havictos he's on ps5
[1:58:31] <MayorRev> oh god the switch bluetooth is ass WutFace
[1:58:33] <Psyramics> @Dakuu75 in game, the character reacts to them at the start
[1:58:35] <%RigmaroleHM> RigmaroleHM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Hey Pat! Just want to say thanks for playing through your library of old games, new games, and weird games - a lot of times it's the first time I see any of them.
[1:58:35] <%hereiam407> It's nice to see Arkane change up the pace, advance a bit more in their gameplay design
[1:58:39] <MayorRev> the latency is terrible
[1:58:46] <+broaches> one neat feature about this game is it has summaries for notes so if you're lazy you can just read the summary
[1:58:51] <%Monkeyweed21> the marning
[1:58:53] <%hereiam407> @MayorRev Staticy?
[1:58:56] <%TOONFOOD> imagine if the floating text was chat instead
[1:59:03] <MayorRev> no, delayed
[1:59:10] <+Havictos> @Dunmarkh So aside from the drm how's the actual game so far?
[1:59:13] <MayorRev> audio delayed by 1/5th of a second
[1:59:17] <%hereiam407> Oh no, Splicers
[1:59:19] <MayorRev> its so noticeable
[1:59:19] <Khester824> What is denovo and can i play this game without it?
[1:59:22] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Great people
[1:59:22] <penitentpendant> Hmm, wonder if you can get info out of him if you save him
[1:59:33] <%Dakuu75> ppl are ass holes
[1:59:48] <%kingmemelord97> Oh this is terrible
[1:59:50] <ZComiX> So is this a time loop or is it jsut everyone revives the next day? So they retain memories?
[1:59:52] <%chiazam> can you talk to Wenjie
[1:59:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> denuvo isn't the problem with the port is it?
[1:59:59] <%hereiam407> Would we all collectively remember, or have our own beaches?
[2:00:05] <$floralkami> @khester824 it's anti-chest software coded into the game.
[2:00:05] <+SirSamVimes> @ZComiX time loop
[2:00:08] <%redthebaron> you should just break everything if the whole thing is about breaking the loop
[2:00:14] <jorniev> it would basically be an office job
[2:00:16] <kazadaz> Passing kidney stones every day forever
[2:00:16] <MasterTonberry23> but being stuck in a loop means youre functionally immortal, so it cancels out
[2:00:19] <%Raikouija> I like colt
[2:00:21] <Dunmarkh> @Havictos looks good
[2:00:22] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:00:22] <+Nero_Cross> @ZComiX Time loop but a small amount of people found a way to retain memories
[2:00:22] <%TOONFOOD> bill murray die hard
[2:00:23] <LorcaNomad> dude this game fucks
[2:00:25] <ZComiX> @sirsamvimes Thx
[2:00:32] <DancesWitBalrog> BAT TAH REE
[2:00:33] <%nanaki_ff14> makes my brain chemicals feel good i like that battery meter
[2:00:42] <%maskofmichael> This is a Tired Old Man character
[2:00:42] <%Ashrox117> Pat did you unlock the armory stash with the batteries in this level?
[2:00:45] <%hereiam407> Mmm, dinner plate of dirt
[2:00:47] <+JaseAdrift> this nerd
[2:00:49] <%SpoonheadInExile> The movie Groundhog Day had a lack of imagination IMO. You know that guy did some super raw shit
[2:00:51] <jorniev> I'm guessing that's showing you how batteries work
[2:00:54] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> is that David Cross
[2:01:16] <+ProfessorMorrigan> PP
[2:01:22] <%hereiam407> @SpoonheadInExile Why do you gotta do that? There should be a movie like that
[2:01:27] <+Havictos> that tape sucks
[2:01:30] <reonome> haha pp
[2:01:32] <+Shady_Zaku> Lil PP
[2:01:34] <valriot> huehue PP
[2:01:34] <+Ynkubus_> @SpoonheadInExile I mean it does imply he did some dark stuff offscreen
[2:01:38] <+ProfessorMorrigan> el pp
[2:01:40] <%polothegreatest> psaGib psaGib
[2:01:42] <SaltyAzteca> You down with LPP?
[2:01:42] <$floralkami> YEAH YOU KNOW ME
[2:01:44] <+fetrigon> les get it
[2:01:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Can only imagine how a group of psychotic bumbling nincompoops did all of this
[2:01:46] <devanmuse> the Let's Play Play
[2:01:47] <+Slovitza> EL PIPI
[2:01:49] <%TOONFOOD> get da pp
[2:01:51] <jorniev> LPP is like the penis in Spanish
[2:02:00] <%hereiam407> @SpoonheadInExile Committing suicide is pretty dark
[2:02:01] <jorniev> PIPI
[2:02:01] <+Havictos> I'm pretty sure even tape could record more than that
[2:02:03] <%Undenizen> HI PAT. we playin some murder groundhog day?
[2:02:06] <Parapattern> Lil PeePee
[2:02:12] <+JaseAdrift> groundhog day lacked imagination is a take
[2:02:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> The El PeePee
[2:02:18] <%nanaki_ff14> dont worry about it
[2:02:18] <+xcompleasedad> Are all these mooks deaf?
[2:02:20] <%hereiam407> What was that noise
[2:02:20] <+BlueLeopard007> damn, they are deaf
[2:02:25] <MasterTonberry23> There were plans to show Bill Murray's character got into some dark stuff, but that was cut because it would have made the character unlikable
[2:02:27] <%MelBrooksKA> I like this voice actor's voice
[2:02:28] <%Anime_Flux> Approaching a Little Sister is a criminal offense. Do not approach the Little Sisters.
[2:02:31] <%logoth_> I see you've reached Half Life 2 land
[2:02:35] <%hereiam407> Whose footprints are these
[2:02:36] <$floralkami> oh man, the age group and cultural demographic of chat...
[2:02:40] <SaltyAzteca> "Mustve been the wind"
[2:02:42] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt is that a Rail Nailgun?
[2:02:46] <%kyh9> Colt's VA is pretty good.
[2:02:49] <$floralkami> only like two people got that
[2:02:59] <%kyh9> I like having a chatty VA with personality as the MC
[2:03:10] <penitentpendant> Follow the wires?
[2:03:18] <%stubborndeer> It looks like someone put a Nuematic pump on a fucking nail gun that is the most illegal weapon I can comprehend
[2:03:35] <%hereiam407> Oh god
[2:03:37] <MasterTonberry23> @stubborndeer only illegal if you get caught!
[2:03:39] <reonome> LUL
[2:03:41] <jorniev> nice
[2:03:43] <akitanito> welp
[2:03:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Not as planned
[2:03:45] <%tusk102> wait not a full loop?
[2:03:45] <+Zeromaru2> too soon?
[2:03:45] <penitentpendant> In universe quicksave
[2:03:47] <+Havictos> Turrets pat's natural enemy
[2:03:48] <%HotSauceFiend> so wait whats the penalty for dying?
[2:03:49] <%hereiam407> Those laser trip wires seem dangerous
[2:03:49] <MasterTonberry23> MELTED
[2:03:50] <Idon__> the 2nd one always gets em
[2:03:50] <%nanaki_ff14> 2 of them lol
[2:03:51] <$dalmek> ain't no OSHA in a time-loop island
[2:03:54] <Krakenoid> gotcha with the ole' double turret
[2:03:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> The power box is visible through a window
[2:04:02] <akitanito> even out of ME-verse you still get melted by turrets
[2:04:05] <kazadaz> Three strikes and you're proper dead
[2:04:05] <Krakenoid> ole johnny two turrets
[2:04:06] <jorniev> that hacking thing seems super useful
[2:04:10] <MasterTonberry23> I wish I could quick save my life. I would have punched out my boss SO many times
[2:04:10] <Psyramics> that guy's having a good time
[2:04:12] <+Shady_Zaku> ohhhh...O.P.P I see lol
[2:04:22] <%logoth_> "A feature, not a bug"
[2:04:38] <SaltyAzteca> THE MAN IN GAUZE, THE MAN IN GAUZE
[2:04:47] <%PigGuy800> so do the lasers not uurt you?
[2:04:47] <%stubborndeer> PAT STAND INSIDE YOUR BODY
[2:04:51] <%PigGuy800> hurt*
[2:05:03] <%kingmemelord97> Oh god is this like that Rick and morty ep with the save state
[2:05:04] <%hereiam407> That body is drenched in LSD
[2:05:28] <AMajorTom> Shit's locked.
[2:05:29] <%bassoontyphoon> GUN
[2:05:45] <%Agami23> huh. switch now has bluetooth audio in the newest update.
[2:05:48] <%Undenizen> so, i understand the day-looping mechanic, but what's this interim not-quite-death mechanic?
[2:05:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> i tested out the switch Bluetooth audio and while there a delay I think its fine as long as you aren't playing a rythmn game
[2:05:54] <%dekkitout> "Wait a sec, I'm Colt"
[2:05:55] <Wydamn> Agami23 for real?
[2:06:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can shoot the power box to do that part no problem
[2:06:12] <Saltmeisterr> @Undenizen 2 death defies per zone
[2:06:14] <SaltyAzteca> Was that Wilheim screaming LUL
[2:06:16] <BrickleBork> it was us along PogChamp
[2:06:20] <GilliamYaeger> @Undenizen You start off with an equippable power that gives you two extra lives per area
[2:06:20] <%Mattais88> Wow, not just Muldoon, you're full on John Hammond
[2:06:21] <%stantheman_97> on purpose, of course
[2:06:27] <%Agami23> @Wydamn yeah. update and its in settings right below controllers and sensors
[2:06:28] <jorniev> nice music

[2:06:33] <%Deft_Thought> Just finished making dinner. How's Deathloop lookin?
[2:06:34] <%Ashrox117> I feel like the show Dark inspired the designers a bit
[2:06:34] <%hereiam407> Radio?
[2:06:37] <Psyramics> O451
[2:06:39] <reonome> 4200
[2:06:41] <penitentpendant> Something for the future
[2:06:43] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> C137 Kappa
[2:06:44] <ianabstract> Is it COLT
[2:06:46] <+BlueLeopard007> colt?
[2:06:46] <%hereiam407> ABCD
[2:06:47] <%Mattais88> 1337
[2:06:47] <%Undenizen> but like... what does that mean? is it a free pass? checkpoint resurrect?
[2:06:49] <+jolista> just loop the death pat
[2:06:49] <Frogwash> Colt?
[2:06:57] <%Deft_Thought> 6969
[2:07:01] <%Deft_Thought> Probably
[2:07:03] <%baka_sugoi> pats
[2:07:03] <$dalmek> Oats
[2:07:03] <+BlueLeopard007> C014?
[2:07:03] <Krakenoid> feels good to murder
[2:07:06] <+0dinpen> Just like 12 minutes
[2:07:06] <%baka_sugoi> oats
[2:07:08] <Mnemonicjohnny> The nullifier field's visual is freakin' gorgeous -- I love the "printing dots in real life" effect.
[2:07:09] <%nanaki_ff14> Wait is the twist going to be you are the leader of the Eternalist?
[2:07:09] <%linSP> but what about morality!
[2:07:10] <SaltyAzteca> They arent even people...they look like dolls
[2:07:13] <%asgard147> limesHmm
[2:07:19] <%asgard147> limesEvil
[2:07:21] <MasterTonberry23> if these people are all gonna be revived anyway, did you really kill them?
[2:07:27] <%hereiam407> Murder man with the murder plan
[2:07:31] <+0dinpen> time morals? rip
[2:07:33] <Krakenoid> timeloop means no consequences, unless someone does something silly like collapse it.
[2:07:33] <EndoMills> they remind me of the masks in we happy few
[2:07:33] <%G_Thunders> I don’t know if the AI gets better, but these are just rando’s given guns right? LIke none of these people are soldiers
[2:07:34] <+BlueLeopard007> colt = C014???
[2:07:34] <%PigGuy800> if you don't know what the code is or what it's attached to why were you looking for it
[2:07:37] <Treasure_Vault> In a timeloop, you can kill your sister wife as many times as you want it doesn't even matter
[2:07:39] <Krakenoid> then all the consequences might come down at once!
[2:07:40] <penitentpendant> If it ends up being C 0 1 7, I'll laugh
[2:07:43] <%Deft_Thought> I thought it was a Deathloop
[2:07:49] <%nanaki_ff14> Time Morals sounds like a podcast episode title
[2:07:49] <%hereiam407> This is the better version of we happy few
[2:08:05] <+ProfessorMorrigan> this is all a therapy session in cole's head Kappa
[2:08:06] <Saltmeisterr> IS THAT FU?
[2:08:09] <%Undenizen> RUAAAAH HUHUHUHUH... AAAAH!
[2:08:12] <%baka_sugoi> broke ass
[2:08:14] <reonome> broke-ass bitch
[2:08:15] <jorniev> what is up with them?
[2:08:19] <normalcygaming> is this an... "Immersive Sim"?
[2:08:21] <Mnemonicjohnny> @G_Thunders They're *drunk* and *stoned* randos, at that.
[2:08:22] <$floralkami> Fu?
[2:08:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I see Arkane's quality dialogue is still in place
[2:08:23] <+fetrigon> yes
[2:08:24] <%DianaTheAscian> sounded like him
[2:08:24] <kikoeru_san> Fu?
[2:08:28] <%Mattais88> @nanaki_ff14 pretty sure it was
[2:08:28] <Psyramics> I also thought that was Fu
[2:08:29] <%linSP> that VA is pretty rad
[2:08:30] <+broaches> damn fu's had it rough after losing to travis
[2:08:31] <%Afterman_> it is an immersive sim
[2:08:32] <%hereiam407> I hope this isn't Cole being dead, and theDeathloop is all just chemicals in his head
[2:08:33] <Dunmarkh> @normalcygaming yes
[2:08:37] <+0dinpen> no moe heroes
[2:08:39] <%DianaTheAscian> @floralkami nmh3 character
[2:08:41] <thelonechris> So I heard the PC port is broke af
[2:08:42] <%nanaki_ff14> thats why it sounds famliar lol
[2:08:44] <%logoth_> IM ALREADY AT FULL HEALTH
[2:08:45] <SocialMisfitGamer> FU from No More Heroes 3
[2:08:46] <MasterTonberry23> Oooh whats over here?
[2:08:48] <sirrice77> @Undenizen what's confusing? You can die a maximum of two times per loop. When you die you go back a short amount of time and are alive again. If you die a third time you start the run over.
[2:08:48] <+The_Jay> Is this on PC?
[2:08:50] <+the_mega_guy_> i like the art style of this game, reminds me of TF2 a bit
[2:08:50] <$floralkami> Ah, NMHs
[2:08:50] <SaltyAzteca> 3 of em, oof
[2:08:50] <%asgard147> limesS

[2:09:14] <%twistedj3ster> in Juli's vibrator
[2:09:15] <%blastyoboots> shouldve kept the battery from the projector
[2:09:15] <tanarath> @the_jay yes, but it's not a good port, wait a bit
[2:09:18] <@GeneralSCPatton> They're all in the depot. Have to shuffle them around to open things.
[2:09:21] <$floralkami> @valriot ALL THAT I SEE
[2:09:21] <LorcaNomad> did you beat this your first playthrough pat?
[2:09:21] <+BIumen> reminds me of the spooky areas in portal

[2:09:38] <%Ashrox117> PAT TRUST ME YOU WANT WHAT IS IN THERE
[2:09:43] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Wasn't there a bunch of batteries in that projector room or am I mistaken
[2:09:45] <kikoeru_san> you are an awful shot sometimes
[2:09:46] <Visorak6> Wasnt your fault pat you were hitting the pipe's invisible hitbox in front of you
[2:09:51] <+The_Jay> @tanarath Yeah that's what I hear, disappointing
[2:09:52] <MasterTonberry23> How could you have committed suicide? I cant believe youve commited suicide!
[2:09:52] <%HotSauceFiend> I still don't understand the penalty for dying. It seems like nothing was lost
[2:09:54] <$Grimlockfly> Cheer500  Deathloop owns

[2:10:13] <%hereiam407> Perfect for a gun fight
[2:10:16] <+ProfessorMorrigan> @HotSauceFiend you get like 2 deaths before it loops
[2:10:16] <$floralkami> @hotsaucefiend again, 3 lives
[2:10:16] <%kingmemelord97> So if pat dies three times does the game restart?
[2:10:19] <%LeiaSkynoober> @HotSauceFiend That isn't your "real" death! It's like a Death's Defiance in Hades
[2:10:20] <Zebens> boomer aim
[2:10:27] <%Ashrox117> Below you left
[2:10:28] <%tank7013> I mean you can't blame Pat for the collision extending off of the pipe
[2:10:29] <%polothegreatest> majestic psaPorgmo
[2:10:33] <%stubborndeer> @HotSauceFiend It's like dark souls sort of, if you play the game without dying it's DRAMATICALLY different and only lasts like three hours
[2:10:35] <%Deft_Thought> (dies)
[2:10:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:10:38] <valriot> LUL

[2:12:47] <Wydamn> You could pee yourself anywhere that you are
[2:13:11] <%kingmemelord97> So form what I’ve seen so far games not at that 60 dollar price point I’m hoping it gets better
[2:13:18] <%TOONFOOD> loops > poops
[2:13:19] <RubberFistFight> @Dunmarkh It's not the QA team's job to fix the bugs, it's their job to identify them. The bugfixing falls to the programmers, and which bugs they fix is dictated by their managers.
[2:13:19] <%bravebravesrobin> Why not just buy a diaper @patstaresat
[2:13:20] <%Undenizen> Okay, something i dont understand in this game: you manually input codes, AND they can be auto-filled. why? wouldn't it make more sense for the game to just flag your file for having seen the code?
[2:13:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @kingmemelord97 I'm sure not getting it for at that price for PC
[2:13:42] <%G_Thunders> @kingmemelord97 Pat’s still going through the tutorial section
[2:13:43] <%PigGuy800> @floralkami getting caught peeing yourself on stream is against
[2:13:56] <RubberFistFight> @kingmemelord97 Yeah it really doesn't look like it's worth that much.
[2:14:20] <+RadioSpirit> This has to be the coolest brb screen I've ever seen

[2:14:51] <DancesWitBalrog> HungryPaimon
[2:15:08] <LoneFonte> no cut
[2:15:09] <%kingmemelord97> It’s a paimon
[2:15:20] <SocialMisfitGamer> @TOONFOOD Majority vote was No Cuts
[2:15:42] <%baka_sugoi> @DancesWitBalrog F O O D
[2:15:43] <DancesWitBalrog> bring back pat the whale HungryPaimon
[2:15:45] <%Undenizen> @RadioSpirit ngl, i kinda liked the old persona style one more.
[2:15:56] <DancesWitBalrog> EMERGENCY FOOD
[2:16:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Just gimmiie the sandwich and i'll cram the whole thing into my face hole at once like a snake
[2:16:08] <%kingmemelord97> Cutting your sandwich adds time to the prep stage just make it and eat it
[2:16:13] <sapphomet777> hpws deathguy going
[2:16:22] <%TOONFOOD> dang,  you're monsters 😅
[2:16:31] <%kingmemelord97> It’s okay sapp
[2:16:41] <raikagelord1> Just got here, how long has Pat been playing the game?
[2:16:42] <RyuuAoi> I love Pat
[2:16:52] <%Undenizen> i cut my sandwiches if i feel fancy
[2:16:55] <mybassgotblasted9000> has we syatyed playing
[2:16:57] <%kingmemelord97> About a hour
[2:16:58] <RubberFistFight> @kingmemelord97 just throw all the ingredients in a blender and drink it. It gets mushed together in your stomach anyway, doing it this way saves time.
[2:16:59] <mybassgotblasted9000> started
[2:17:02] <%Ashrox117> How am I supposed to dip a whole uncut sandwich into my cup of water
[2:17:06] <DancesWitBalrog> I do like precut sandwiches that are sold in Japan
[2:17:08] <%boofybaps> Just got here too. Does Pat like it so far?
[2:17:14] <raikagelord1> @kingmemelord97 thanks
[2:17:14] <sapphomet777> imagine not always adding a third bread slice to the sandwich to make it more filling. yall aint surviving The Winter.
[2:17:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 2 hours 17 minutes of stream, about an hour 5 of game
[2:17:23] <%baka_sugoi> @DancesWitBalrog fold it
[2:17:29] <%kingmemelord97> @rubberfistfight now that’s barbaric
[2:17:33] <%Ashrox117> @boofybaps Only when it’s cut into rectangles
[2:17:39] <raikagelord1> Wanna how far I need to go back on the Vod
[2:17:52] <RubberFistFight> @sapphomet777 considering the idea of The Winter is often found alongside the idea of food shortage, i'm not sure putting an extra slice of bread on there is a wise idea.
[2:18:01] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @sapphomet777 I just add 3 more slices of deli meat to the original 4 slices
[2:18:04] <sapphomet777> rubber, wanna spit in my food too since at that point its chyme?
[2:18:11] <RubberFistFight> @kingmemelord97 I live in Australia. Mad Max is a documentary.
[2:18:16] <%boofybaps> @ashrox117 im confused and too afraid to ask for clarification

[2:20:59] <%Agami23> @Wydamn no problem, glad it works better for you.
[2:21:00] <sapphomet777> pat cheated BUT it was because of his ADHD
[2:21:02] <+Nautilus_Bot> is dis ps5
[2:21:06] <+Rolandknight> Have you played the game with invasion on?
[2:21:09] <sapphomet777> its why he wears the mask, guys
[2:21:15] <TrollKing96> Are all codes in this game randomized?
[2:21:15] <%kingmemelord97> @sapphomet777  I mean if death have no consequences for you what’s the point of human morals
[2:21:17] <+xcompleasedad> @Nautilus_Bot Yes
[2:21:22] <Wydamn> Rolandknight potential invader wants to know
[2:21:34] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat The string and number mean anything
[2:21:34] <+MisterAvry> Hey everyone. So what IS this shit?
[2:21:38] <+Nautilus_Bot> @Nautilus_Bot ty ty
[2:21:38] <+JaseAdrift> sounds fun
[2:21:45] <%Monkeyweed21> hot
[2:21:46] <RubberFistFight> Yeah they're just gonna stomp your barnhole inside-out.
[2:21:47] <+raideyroo> @kingmemelord97 Kuz getting killed probably still hurts
[2:21:48] <sapphomet777> i mean all the more reason to grow Cool Fruits if you own land/dirt/a lawn
[2:21:50] <+Kiaayo> @MisterAvry it's an arkane game
[2:21:51] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat on the map board
[2:21:51] <Jrocy247> Can you show it off?
[2:21:51] <Zebens> so like darks souls
[2:21:55] <+Nautilus_Bot> it's like fortnite but you drop in every day
[2:21:56] <Dunmarkh> cowardice
[2:22:03] <akitanito> what do you get out of invading?
[2:22:04] <Visorak6> How does the woman's story vary from yours if all the enemies are on her side?
[2:22:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @kingmemelord97 I mean, respecting morals and life keeps you from becoming someone who needs to GO
[2:22:08] <Wydamn> Nautilus_Bot so just like fortnite
[2:22:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> even with a loop
[2:22:18] <%sjay662> been playing on friends only, it is some mario party tier levels of salt in my friend group
[2:22:19] <RubberFistFight> The audio is desynced from the gameplay
[2:22:23] <@GeneralSCPatton> WOO! Just smoked Aleksis during the first loop! psaDab
[2:22:23] <+Rolandknight> @wydamn sadly I don’t have the game yet
[2:22:24] <%Raikouija> our only hope chat is if Suzi wants to play ball with pat LUL
[2:22:25] <sapphomet777> this is dishonored 3 but the designers wanted to maybe do something mechanically distinct from dieselpunk halflife
[2:22:26] <RubberFistFight> the knife noise didn't match the animation at all.
[2:22:26] <%Deft_Thought> Where do these folks go when you kill em?
[2:22:28] <+trackles_64> Hows the  dathloop jank going chat?
[2:22:28] <%baka_sugoi> HEAD SHOT
[2:22:28] <%Trllly> Trllly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak! No more Amazon Prime so this one came out of my own pocket dammit.
[2:22:31] <+MisterAvry> top notch AI
[2:22:34] <MiamiMemory> @Wydamn  This game looks like the battle pass
[2:22:40] <%Ashrox117> Also, traumatic memories probably stick around loop to loop
[2:22:42] <Dunmarkh> @RubberFistFight you're desynced from gameplay
[2:22:42] <+raideyroo> @Visorak6 Other guns and powers to use in invasion mode, and cosmetics for both characters
[2:22:48] <raikagelord1> Was that a Machete knife?
[2:22:50] <sapphomet777> yea its probably the battlepasd
[2:22:53] <%PigGuy800> have you tried your hand at invading?
[2:22:59] <flap_junior> Is there a world clock or does time progress with story?
[2:23:05] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight eh probably. Pat's talking matches his face-flaps though so it's not the stream.
[2:23:07] <+Dannzzyy> Has pat looped death yet?
[2:23:08] <+Javaa01> @raikagelord1 It's a Kukri
[2:23:15] <+fetrigon> @misteravry you might wanna google it. It's hard to completely describe in text.
[2:23:15] <sapphomet777> its the half life 2 artist of course its a machete knife
[2:23:15] <%Undenizen> Colt, that is NOT a tight groove.
[2:23:16] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Did you just poor a bunch of bullets into that gun to reload it like a roided out BB gun?
[2:23:21] <+JaseAdrift> @flap_junior time progresses depending on the zone you are in
[2:23:22] <%LeiaSkynoober> @flap_junior Progress with story I think!
[2:23:25] <+trackles_64> is this the PS5 version?
[2:23:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I don't like how the red bar in the top right doesn't go through the middle, but slightly below it
[2:23:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> top left*
[2:23:34] <+raideyroo> @ScreamLord It's a nail gun
[2:23:34] <sapphomet777> yeah hes PSV
[2:23:36] <raikagelord1> @javaa01 really big one then
[2:23:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> fuck
[2:23:41] <%kingmemelord97> @deft_thought  probably some time limbo till their loop restarts
[2:23:43] <%cooldude69xx> @ScreamLord I think its nails even
[2:23:44] <%baka_sugoi> EZ
[2:23:46] <+MisterAvry> why do words sometimes float helpfully on walls?
[2:23:46] <RubberFistFight> holy shit why does this game look so cheap
[2:23:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> i'm becoming woolie
[2:23:54] <SPidERMan8576> Did you hear about deathloop?
[2:23:55] <%Deft_Thought> @kingmemelord97 Neat.
[2:23:58] <kazadaz> The mobs are basically friction to make it easier for julianna to fight cole
[2:24:10] <+Buzzkill983> Was
[2:24:21] <%baka_sugoi> gun
[2:24:27] <raikagelord1> Can you look at things more than once?
[2:24:31] <Wydamn> It's the Vo-You Trencher
[2:24:34] <sapphomet777> i fuckin HATE the centered UI things with big dump backgrounded images of guns. show me an outline instead?
[2:24:38] <%Undenizen> So, someone designed all these ads for the island. who's head of PR?
[2:24:44] <%Dakuu75> man, this guy is a good VA
[2:24:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The fuzz
[2:24:46] <%Trllly> Ive been playing this for a smidge and my one gripe is that it seems somewhat easy. Even when i get into some trouble, Its easy to just stand in a room and wait for everyone to run in and get shot
[2:24:52] <%TOONFOOD> Bill mumento die hard shockk
[2:24:56] <CharacterCarp08> This game looks really cheap, but the styling looks pretty good. I don't quite get it.
[2:24:59] <%LeiaSkynoober> Colt hates copes
[2:25:04] <%Undenizen> @Dakuu75 the VA is really good.
[2:25:10] <RubberFistFight> @Trllly it seems the AI is super garbage.
[2:25:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> the health bar is off-center and i hate it
[2:25:17] <%Trllly> @CharacterCarp08 Cheap???
[2:25:18] <+JaseAdrift> jesus chat has no idea what a cheap game looks like
[2:25:26] <%sjay662> I still miss the fact Colt isn't Dave Fennoy (Rodin, Lee Everet) anymore. New guy is good, but I like Fennoy's voice more
[2:25:26] <sapphomet777> ...is this an anticapitalist game?
[2:25:32] <%ScreamLord> So how are you liking the game so far?
[2:25:32] <sapphomet777> because hot
[2:25:33] <+Havictos> People just want to complain
[2:25:33] <SPidERMan8576> 70% of the budget went to marketing
[2:25:33] <thelonechris> So is this like an Illumanti society?
[2:25:38] <%Undenizen> @ChrisPlaysThing i HATE these diagonal bars
[2:25:39] <+raideyroo> Not sure if I know what you mean by cheap. But it is running on a relatively old engine. It still looks good imo
[2:25:40] <umbraawitch> @JaseAdrift LMFAO
[2:25:51] <kazadaz> @sapphomet777 Sure, if you like
[2:26:03] <RubberFistFight> @JaseAdrift There is something seriously off about this design though. I can't pinpoint it but it really honestly reminds me of much cheaper games. For some reason I get Outer Wilds vibes.
[2:26:18] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn NotLikeThis sbfpSetIn
[2:26:18] <MiamiMemory> Getting a lot of Bioshock vibes from this game.
[2:26:22] <%Raikouija> RIP Colt
[2:26:25] <%Undenizen> what's updaam?
[2:26:27] <%hereiam407> Did anyone else come up with the game idea 'Deathpoop' yet?
[2:26:28] <%Raikouija> scifriNLT
[2:26:30] <%Ashrox117> Why would you think cheap and then say a AAA game lol
[2:26:31] <%maskofmichael> It Was ME
[2:26:31] <+fetrigon> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:26:33] <Gorshum> LUL I like this dude so much.
[2:26:36] <Man_in_the_Red> getting a lot of Persona 5 vibes

[2:26:39] <+Kiaayo> @Undenizen not much, what's up with you?
[2:26:49] <raikagelord1> I love the voice acting of Colt. LUL LUL LUL
[2:26:49] <%TOONFOOD> whats updog?
[2:26:50] <Ardailec> Have you gotten all 8 targets in a single run yet?

[2:26:54] <BUNS_holt> what's updog
[2:26:56] <%Treuan> Notr much what's up with you?
[2:26:58] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt nah not the gameplay, i mean like... the actual world design. Something about it is bugging me. PARTS of the game look great, but other parts and assets look dismal.
[2:27:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> There's no way Arkane didn't know about that name
[2:27:01] <+Mrbaconator> it smells like updaam in here
[2:27:02] <%faldin> what's updoog
[2:27:03] <%GarbageNirvana> the lööps
[2:27:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Gonna fuck with people so damn hard if i get the chance
[2:27:07] <kazadaz> Whom'st've is updaam????
[2:27:09] <%Raikouija> My concern tbh is the time schedule would be difficult to follow, but maybe it isnt'
[2:27:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> speaking of Outer Wilds, are you gonna play the DLC when it comes out, @PatStaresAt ?
[2:27:12] <digimonda> whats the point of those trinket items?
[2:27:15] <+Catoclystic> updogma balls

[2:27:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Back to UpDong
[2:27:29] <+trackles_64> any major bugs yet?
[2:27:37] <%hereiam407> Why are you saying Updog?
[2:27:38] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Before I got it myself I wasn't sure how accurate the whole "Dishonored but Majora's Mask" Thing would be, and man, you were SUPER RIGHT.
[2:27:44] <Mnemonicjohnny> @raikagelord1 He's really good at selling the "In for this dumb shit, but in *way* over his head" angle.

[2:28:43] <%kyh9> I really like him
[2:28:56] <%Ashrox117> “Hey Julianna you awake”
[2:28:56] <%hereiam407> The man is practically invincible

[2:29:37] <%hereiam407> What a disappointment we happy few was
[2:29:38] <umbraawitch> @BUNS_holt twitch chat in a nutshell

[2:29:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Crimetown did not change much since Woolie left, hopefully it has since i have. But word on the street is nah
[2:29:51] <%kingmemelord97> man those are some cheap looking mask
[2:30:01] <%hereiam407> Will Arnett?
[2:30:03] <%Mattais88> Time Loop cannibals?
[2:30:03] <Saltmeisterr> its a funni button
[2:30:05] <%Faustgesicht> You going into a base of cannibals?
[2:30:06] <captainnathaniel> i bet the guy believes the apha beta wolves shit
[2:30:20] <+nial_evol> damn he was pretty blase for being shot in the face 3 times lol

[2:30:35] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Are they cannibals?
[2:30:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> I just took out Aleksis, and I'm seeing some fucked up party events that you can totally turn against him.
[2:30:43] <%Undenizen> @captainnathaniel wait till he hears about the forbidden SIGMA wolves.
[2:31:04] <reonome> CHOKEJERK TIME
[2:31:11] <%hereiam407> James Carredine's room
[2:31:12] <%kyh9> Is that Colt?
[2:31:14] <MayorRev> chokejerk button
[2:31:18] <viewtifulr> back to the tried and true choke jerk
[2:31:19] <%kyh9> That sounds a little like Colt
[2:31:23] <%hereiam407> I'm sorry, David
[2:31:41] <%Undenizen> so it's russian roulette with poison gas?
[2:31:46] <MayorRev> damn dude
[2:31:53] <%stubborndeer> OH that's right! the great fear of immortals is loosing immortality, so that's why everyone is so lethargic, is because they are afraid of the possibility that the loop will end
[2:32:07] <%kyh9> Goddamn, love this game
[2:32:21] <%Undenizen> I lowkey love the term "amortal"

[2:32:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> @Havictos Part of the party does appear to be a comedy or maybe singing contest, where they can just drop them through a trap door into a meat grinder if they suck.
[2:32:50] <%stubborndeer> DICKBAGS
[2:32:55] <Jrocy247> These Dialogues are NOT spaced out properly
[2:32:59] <%hereiam407> @stickygumbolee Someone's fetish film
[2:33:00] <%greasypete00> so far i really like colt as a protag
[2:33:08] <reonome> monkaS
[2:33:14] <%stubborndeer> I want this main character in every game now
[2:33:21] <%stickygumbolee> The ABCs of Deathpoop
[2:33:24] <%greasypete00> is this the invasion type of thing they showed off
[2:33:26] <vapelad_dabberb01> dialogue is spaced perfectly, actually
[2:33:30] <%Deft_Thought> So is this a player or an AI?
[2:33:38] <%hereiam407> Lagggg
[2:33:40] <%Deft_Thought> AI
[2:33:40] <+nial_evol> she got rollback
[2:33:42] <DS_ShockTrooper> LOL
[2:33:44] <akitanito> that was weird
[2:33:47] <%Ashrox117> Imagining Colt drop kicking zombies in Dying Light 2
[2:33:47] <%Undenizen> now, i dunno if anyone else caught that, but Julianna was talking like whoever was coming after Colt was NOT Julianna.
[2:33:49] <reonome> EZ
[2:33:53] <mr_mister0> YEAH MURDER
[2:33:53] <RubberFistFight> OK it's especially weird that the gameworld looks cheap since Void Engine is based on idTech 6. It SHOULD look fantastic. Wish I could put my finger on exactly what about it is sitting wrong with me though.
[2:33:55] <+JaseAdrift> that dialog was spaced fine
[2:33:57] <%Raikouija> Invader Defeated
[2:34:00] <%JonathLP> We dishonored now?
[2:34:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> oh hey that sounds like Blink
[2:34:05] <penitentpendant> Hi 'Blink'
[2:34:07] <Jrocy247> You sure? They literally keep snapping to next sentence within a instant, that's not really spaced out well
[2:34:08] <+nial_evol> sorta anti-climactic lol
[2:34:09] <%greasypete00> it even has the fuckin blink picture from dishonored
[2:34:12] <bananakohai> that was sorta anticlimatic
[2:34:12] <+dmbender> yo rip that guy
[2:34:15] <+trackles_64> Dark Souls much
[2:34:16] <DS_ShockTrooper> This game good?
[2:34:17] <+Havictos> @Undenizen Maybe there's something else?

[2:34:18] <+Javaa01> @JonathLP With no recharge cap
[2:34:18] <%PigGuy800> does that persist between loops?

[2:34:27] <%kingmemelord97> so thats the mr x of the game ?
[2:34:31] <%chiazam> So does she have Reprise?
[2:34:39] <%Mattais88> So what are the odds on those two being married?
[2:34:41] <+trackles_64> is there a way for chat to challenge you?

[2:34:51] <Saltmeisterr> DA LOOP
[2:34:54] <%Undenizen> @Havictos I'm thinking she can be more than one person?
[2:34:57] <%stubborndeer> Jullianna's speciality as I understand it is that she prepares WAY better than colt, or appears to, because she has had longer, so she is running forward as colt is running backwards, setting up the future encounters so she doesn't die
[2:35:02] <%Raikouija> Day 2
[2:35:03] <scrumbotime> Do A Go Go Bye Bye
[2:35:05] <@Lion_kun> So how did you make progress?
[2:35:06] <+trackles_64> Check if you got your preorder back
[2:35:09] <%hereiam407> Mmm, fast loads
[2:35:10] <+toastybites> MORE LOOPS BROTHER
[2:35:20] <TheAntiNihilist> LOOPer
[2:35:20] <Mnemonicjohnny> @RubberFistFight I dunno what the heck you're talking about, man, what does "looks cheap" even mean?  Poorly polished?  Crude graphics?  Reuse of assets?
[2:35:22] <+Javaa01> @Lion_kun You finish the rest of the tutorial
[2:35:24] <%Agami23> oh hey, the bar for blink actually shows you how many charges you have and doesent show you a shitty bar
[2:35:24] <SQDizzy> frooty loops
[2:35:25] <%cade_calrayn> SPOILERS PAT
[2:35:30] <+MisterAvry> So are all these people just living forever in a time loop on a murder-debauchery island?
[2:35:30] <%cade_calrayn> lol jk
[2:35:37] <%Undenizen> a delicious bowl of DeathLoops
[2:35:40] <%kingmemelord97> wait what , so the loop restarts even if you dont die
[2:35:41] <%hereiam407> @Mnemonicjohnny Maybe he doesn't like the art direction
[2:35:44] <%Trllly> I worried about the multiplayer component to this game when i first heard about it but so far its not been as annoying as i thought it would be
[2:35:45] <%logoth_> YEaahh
[2:35:54] <%TOONFOOD> @javaa01 ah right nice one
[2:35:55] <%Undenizen> actually for eternity Colt
[2:36:05] <UnusualHiro> LUL
[2:36:22] <BUNS_holt> colt runs like a fat grandma with shopping bags hanging off her arms
[2:36:25] <%Deft_Thought> Do you keep the passive stat bonuses?
[2:36:27] <MiamiMemory> Colt reminds me of Black Dynamite
[2:36:29] <%Dakuu75> "I'm so happy my ex jsut murdered me." wtf?
[2:36:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> Are they fuck-fighting or fight-fucking?
[2:36:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Wondering if you eventually just get to speedrunning an optimal path through most of this game
[2:36:34] <IminyourBase> he's getting faster
[2:36:39] <%hax_metatron> You ever see a piece of media you know will be an underrated classic down the line, in realtime as it is released and is happening? That is DEATHLOOP
[2:36:40] <%chiazam> So what exactly do you keep between loops?
[2:36:44] <+toastybites> Dante Raising Simulator
[2:36:45] <%cade_calrayn> @GeneralSCPatton both
[2:36:55] <%toolofparanoia> WOO MURDER
[2:37:04] <%hereiam407> Did his arm eat that?
[2:37:04] <%Order_of_Mystery> I like Colt and Juliana's relationship
[2:37:09] <SaltyAzteca> Pat welcomes murder in time loops because his time ethics dont exist LUL
[2:37:14] <+MisterAvry> You down with LPP?
[2:37:15] <%kyh9> @stubborndeer Which, ironically, as long as Colt is also immortal, means they can never rest.  Everyone has to be on high alert while he lives
[2:37:17] <+Kiaayo> you down with lpp? yeah you know me
[2:37:22] <%LeiaSkynoober> @chiazam Knawledge and abilities it looks like!
[2:37:29] <%baka_sugoi> TIME
[2:37:39] <+xcompleasedad> Because time loops aren't real?
[2:37:40] <%hereiam407> You're eventually going to be a murderer on the final loop
[2:37:41] <%kyh9> Until you break the loop and now everyone is dead permanently
[2:37:44] <akitanito> is it murder if it gets undone anyway
[2:37:45] <ChungusQuest> Is that a Spanish Elmo? El Pee Pee?
[2:37:45] <%Order_of_Mystery> time ethics are bullshit, just like the queen of england
[2:37:46] <%Ashrox117> Said like a 4th dimensional being
[2:37:47] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight I don't know. I honestly don't. My girlfriend just commented that something seems off about it as well though, so I'm not COMPLETELY insane.
[2:37:48] <%hax_metatron> Wait till you meet the final villain of Steel Ball Run LUL
[2:37:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat is one of those people i'd never trust with power
[2:37:53] <Treasure_Vault> The LPP is probably a single piece of paper titled the Loop Protection Plan
[2:37:55] <+0dinpen> Your lord and savior, knows what you've done. Because he deathloops for our sins
[2:37:56] <%angryoptimist> Time loops can't swim.
[2:37:57] <%stubborndeer> @kyh9 I don't want to spoil anything but only one of them wants the loop to end and for mortality to resume
[2:38:03] <sirrice77> @chiazam Knowledge and abilities. Later on theres a mechanic to be able to carry forward weapons and stuff
[2:38:06] <%GarbageNirvana> So how does anyone get anything done here
[2:38:12] <TheAntiNihilist> So what's the motivation in the game? Just revenge?
[2:38:13] <MiamiMemory> The past is far behind us. The future doesn't exist.
[2:38:14] <%hax_metatron> There is no time ethics: Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
[2:38:21] <%hereiam407> @GarbageNirvana Infinite time
[2:38:21] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt So you're saying if his plan worked Nox would be justified?
[2:38:30] <%logoth_> The librarby
[2:38:38] <AdmiralButtloaf> the enemies seem to have blurry textures
[2:38:38] <+xcompleasedad> @GarbageNirvana They set it all up before the Loop. The Loop is an endless party
[2:38:53] <TheFramedWarlock> Nox would totally be justified
[2:38:54] <akitanito> big deaf
[2:38:54] <+PkSilent01> I’ll just wait until this game is out for Xbox because I hate DRM and I don’t have a PS5
[2:38:57] <TheFramedWarlock> If it worked
[2:38:58] <%hereiam407> Enemies do look a little blurry
[2:39:01] <akitanito> kill em all colt
[2:39:01] <%GarbageNirvana> That sounds like a tremendous pain in the ass tbh
[2:39:03] <%logoth_> Kill em all 1989
[2:39:05] <@ssjklyco> The Genome soldiers were pretty clueless
[2:39:08] <%kingmemelord97> remeber kids d4c is totally not op
[2:39:08] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight Some stuff looks cartoony and out of place and lit weirdly, other stuff like the shot of the beach/tide going out and the rock walls looks great. Also the NPC animations are weirdly stiff.
[2:39:09] <$ImExtremelyManly> what was that noise
[2:39:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Who wants to party ALL the time
[2:39:18] <%Raikouija> a book

[2:40:42] <%logoth_> but GUN
[2:40:42] <@Moobot> @Emelyns I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 41m.
[2:40:44] <%Order_of_Mystery> This whole Other Colt thing reminds me of Timesplitters 3 and the other "you's" in that game
[2:40:57] <%toolofparanoia> BYE FUTURE COLT
[2:40:59] <+TheLastStar> hes got so much charisma
[2:40:59] <%kingmemelord97> wait
[2:41:00] <+MisterAvry> "No more handholding" BUT WAIT HERE'S A POPUP TO HOLD YOUR HAND!
[2:41:08] <%kingmemelord97> oh i know how this game ends now
[2:41:08] <DS_ShockTrooper> Is pat gonna be attacked by real players now?
[2:41:12] <kazadaz> it stands for let's player's penis
[2:41:22] <%hereiam407> Thats a lot of info
[2:41:30] <+Havictos> Had to use the bathroom what was the LPP?
[2:41:34] <%kingmemelord97> @DS_ShockTrooper no he set it to friends only so only susie can invade
[2:41:35] <a_mad_dragon_> i'm gonna guess residuum lets you keep stuff through loops
[2:41:44] <%Dommykins> Dommykins subscribed with Prime. 
[2:41:45] <kazadaz> A CANAL PANAMA
[2:41:46] <%hereiam407> Loops Per Pat?
[2:41:51] <chompl14> if you replay the game and already know everything, can you beat the game without ever looping?
[2:41:52] <%sporeian94> so wait do you gotta kill all 8 in 1 loop?
[2:41:52] <%LeiaSkynoober> @Havictos List of people to murder to break da loop
[2:42:02] <+MisterAvry> is one of them a dog?
[2:42:08] <%RealThiele> dog
[2:42:09] <%sporeian94> game answered my question lol
[2:42:10] <a_mad_dragon_> NOT THE DOG
[2:42:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @Havictos the Bombers Notebook from Majoras Mask
[2:42:13] <%Piemen99> fuck yeh
[2:42:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Speedrun murders?
[2:42:18] <%chiazam> This was in a trailer
[2:42:21] <+just_julius_who> hitman dishonored
[2:42:22] <%Order_of_Mystery> this game is *fascinating*
[2:42:23] <Dunmarkh> @MisterAvry nah they're just a furry
[2:42:26] <+MisterAvry> You gotta pup snuff to break the loop?
[2:42:29] <valriot> Gotta do the Full Flush hitman run
[2:42:29] <%Raikouija> AGDQ runs of this game are gonna be lit
[2:42:33] <viewtifulr> persona 3 forgot to crucifix the dog
[2:42:34] <umbraawitch> how is this so far
[2:42:34] <%hereiam407> If this game has a blending mechanic, we've got first person Hotman
[2:42:41] <%kyh9> I imagine they all remember the loops too
[2:42:41] <%hereiam407> Hitman*
[2:42:43] <Questiy> Is this why you put your practice in the Prey DLC?
[2:42:46] <akitanito> you will always miss one location?
[2:42:49] <%Agami23> imagine if they released a demo rather than all the trailers that didnt explain the game at all
[2:42:49] <%kyh9> Wouldn't they adjust their behavior after too many kills of the same time
[2:42:50] <+JaseAdrift> Speed runs of this game are gonna be sick
[2:42:50] <kazadaz> The ideal is to convince them all to line up and form Vishnu, then get em all with one bullet
[2:42:58] <%sporeian94> so then there's a specific order to do all these in to get everyone?
[2:43:04] <+BlueLeopard007> so Hitman Meet's Returnal
[2:43:04] <%Afterman_> @akitanito 4 time periods, 4 locations
[2:43:18] <+fetrigon> snuff pup. break loop. got it.
[2:43:23] <%chiazam> So there's a way to go to the lab in the morning
[2:43:23] <%TOONFOOD> kojima playing DS while playing MGS
[2:43:24] <Man_in_the_Red> but also all arkane games have the elevator ledge clips
[2:43:25] <Mnemonicjohnny> @kyh9 *They* don't carry over memory between loops.  You do, for some reason.
[2:43:28] <%linSP> so the best theoretical speedrun would be hell, because you'd have to guess the codes
[2:43:30] <+Javaa01> Time to kill Wenjie, and kill Wenjie, kill Wenjie and maybe still kill some more Wenjie
[2:43:33] <PerrinGoldeneyes> the randomized codes will be annoying in the any%, definitely make it a lot longer
[2:43:35] <%Raikouija> damn! thats words to live by
[2:43:35] <%Mattais88> So you basically spend some time going through a level, getting everything down, so the next loop you can walk in the front door and pop them?
[2:43:43] <+MisterAvry> Man, Sarah Lynn is a weird antagonist
[2:43:44] <%hereiam407> Colt's been dead the whole time! I got it!
[2:43:52] <Purpleleven> He died as he lived: pissing
[2:43:55] <%kyh9> @kyh9 Colt and Julianna that is.  Interesting.
[2:43:56] <akitanito> oh no, you stuck his face in his own piss
[2:43:58] <%Ashrox117> Another pusser
[2:44:02] <+Havictos> is Julianna a psychopath? She seems really into the whole murder thing?
[2:44:03] <%Ashrox117> pisser woops
[2:44:04] <%asgard147> is that how you get to keep your weapons/
[2:44:04] <%Piemen99> man killing a guy with his dick out is pretty fucked up
[2:44:04] <%chiazam> HOW MUCH DOES SHE KNOW!?!?!?
[2:44:06] <%hereiam407> He died as he lived, dying
[2:44:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @fetrigon Pup Snuffers inc. Ending time loops since 89
[2:44:10] <SaltyAzteca> That pepper Mill is totally a Rocket Raccoon favourite
[2:44:11] <+wraithtaker162> I don't know why so many guards in this game are just pissin
[2:44:13] <+Havictos> like almost sexually
[2:44:21] <%kingmemelord97> thats just a fallout gun
[2:44:22] <MasterTonberry23> Dont worry when time loops it wil be like we never murdered him and defiled the corpse
[2:44:28] <boomerjuice> dick kill complete
[2:44:31] <MasterTonberry23> uh are the textures spazzing out?
[2:44:32] <%hereiam407> That looks painful
[2:44:32] <xbb1024> This seems like a giant mindgame to get Colt to do all this
[2:44:32] <+fetrigon> @chrisplaysthing LUL
[2:44:35] <kazadaz> Man the Twitch music distortion's gettin real bad
[2:44:37] <RayMan799> so how're you liking it so far Pat?
[2:44:43] <%maskofmichael> @Havictos I bet it's a "Power Corrupts" kind of thing
[2:44:46] <+MisterAvry> She's revealing a lot of information to you when she could just keep quiet. I bet she wants to break the loop too but can't
[2:44:55] <DS_ShockTrooper> A nail gun HahaSnowhal
[2:44:57] <BurdRightsActivist> That's a COOL GUN
[2:45:04] <%hereiam407> Colt seems like a bit of a dirt bag off the bat
[2:45:08] <%Ashrox117> The music just sounds distorted in the game
[2:45:13] <%hereiam407> I bet he's the final boss, and you have to kill yourself
[2:45:18] <kazadaz> THE ass END OF EVERYTHING
[2:45:20] <%chiazam> yeah I think Julianna is really Joker-esque in the way she seems obsessed with messing with Colt eternally
[2:45:26] <%G_Thunders> The nailgun haptic feedback is some 10/10 design
[2:45:57] <BurdRightsActivist> Haptic feedback? Sounds like something which doesn't exist
[2:45:59] <%Qsmash_> nail to the back of the head
[2:46:10] <%hereiam407> Nailed it
[2:46:28] <%G_Thunders> @burdrightsactivist uh it was one of the biggest things sony was pushing about their PS5 controllers lol
[2:46:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I wonder if the loop is Colt just can't help but put put dick in Crazy an set this all off again
[2:46:45] <BurdRightsActivist> @G_Thunders PS5s? Not real.
[2:46:46] <kazadaz> If you stuck one o them nails into a board you've have a reusable nail, the ultimate weapon
[2:46:59] <%chiazam> So will there be any lore explanation to why these people don't look like people
[2:47:15] <%hereiam407> @kazadaz Not as foolproof as you think
[2:47:17] <SaltyAzteca> SAY THE COOL ONE LINER
[2:47:19] <%cade_calrayn> is she talking to herself?
[2:47:19] <kazadaz> Wens-jie

[2:47:48] <GravityMilkShake> dubstep gun?

[2:47:53] <%kingmemelord97> what the dog doin
[2:47:59] <+Havictos> @cade_calrayn It seems that they can bring in versions of themselves from different points in the loop
[2:48:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The Universe would collapse fro mthe pure Sexual Energy, Colt. that's why.
[2:48:24] <DoctorDoctorMD> I don't even believe the PS5 is real I've never been in a room with one

[2:51:50] <SaltyAzteca> last 2 lets go
[2:51:56] <%GarbageNirvana> So I came in a bit late, is that just a nail gun
[2:51:57] <DS_ShockTrooper> IDK why this game reminds me of bioshock
[2:52:07] <+MisterAvry> probably for the best
[2:52:07] <%hereiam407> How was that spelled?
[2:52:11] <%hereiam407> @DS_ShockTrooper Same
[2:52:19] <MasterTonberry23> The loops been going on since last Thursday
[2:52:21] <SaltyAzteca> Trans-At?
[2:52:26] <kazadaz> Like the company in Prey?
[2:52:29] <BurdRightsActivist> TRANS GUN? PogChamp
[2:52:32] <mistspade> Sorry a trans-what gun?
[2:52:34] <+ashesofahero> @DS_ShockTrooper their style in general for their games always gave me a bioshock feel, the art direction maybe
[2:52:34] <Psyramics> cause its got a lot of bioshock dna in it
[2:52:36] <$Futurecity10> Its a reference to Prey
[2:52:37] <%G_Thunders> I thought it was Transtar like from prey?
[2:52:43] <%polothegreatest> bioshock 2022 psaGoblin
[2:52:43] <kazadaz> Transtar?
[2:52:44] <%SpoonheadInExile> Trans-At? like an AT-AT?

[2:53:24] <RubberFistFight> Why was the gun renamed?

[2:57:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I like this theme of "Failure once is not the end, what you learned from failing is more important than an easy win"
[2:57:23] <LorcaNomad> GO COLT!
[2:57:36] <%hereiam407> Good job, congratulations!

[2:57:52] <+Shady_Zaku> THE MACCHHIIIIINE
[2:57:53] <Escherite> It's good to learn from your mistakes. But it's better to learn from the mistakes of others.

[2:59:26] <MiamiMemory> Colt is a gun weeb
[2:59:27] <kazadaz> So you're gonna go invade right?
[2:59:29] <%hereiam407> Atomic Heart is going to be the B  movie version of this
[2:59:30] <blitzmentalist> @MasterTonberry23 let him seethe and mald, even
[2:59:30] <%kyh9> ADMIRAL AMMUNITION

[2:59:46] <+toastybites> @Piemen99 to show the chat
[2:59:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @RubberFistFight I'll take it as a compliment LUL

[3:00:02] <%Piemen99> @Piemen99 ah
[3:00:19] <tanarath> wait, if you're linked to the anom, aren't you a visionary too?
[3:00:24] <%retrosadness> is non-lethal a thing in this?
[3:00:25] <TheFramedWarlock> So do you actually get powers ? Or do those not carry over and you have to find them in runs
[3:00:25] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:00:34] <%SpoonheadInExile> Oh so like the mega man
[3:00:41] <MasterTonberry23> You want powers go kill people. Life lessons folks
[3:00:51] <SaltyAzteca> So now its a Dark Souls  Bell Tower edition
[3:00:54] <RubberFistFight> @ChrisPlaysThing He made that game "Getting Over It" where you're a dude in a pot climbing a mountain with a sledgehammer, and it was littered with positive platitudes like that. Which most people switched off because MAN was it obnoxious hearing him say that when you lost 2 hours of progress in 1 second.
[3:00:57] <+MisterAvry> what is updaam?
[3:01:00] <+goldexp123> Whats updom
[3:01:04] <%HairballCT> not much, what's up with you Kappa
[3:01:04] <kazadaz> It's an Outer Wilds
[3:01:05] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> What's Updaam? Kappa
[3:01:09] <TheFramedWarlock> You're headed to Updog ?
[3:01:09] <Saltmeisterr> library time?
[3:01:10] <jorniev> UPDOG?
[3:01:15] <%TOONFOOD> what's updong?
[3:01:18] <%chiazam> UPDAM
[3:01:35] <lloyddboy> So what do you get from engaging in pvp? other than dickstomping
[3:01:35] <%polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[3:01:44] <+Havictos> She's really crazy
[3:01:50] <MasterTonberry23> Hmm thats ominous. Is it a radioactive hellscape out there?
[3:01:56] <+Soliloquy123> I like that that line was perfectly synced with the stealth kill
[3:02:01] <BurdRightsActivist> Electric butler
[3:02:03] <kazadaz> Do you have the double-jump mod?
[3:02:05] <boomerjuice> chat is the real deathloop making the same unfunny jokes every 5 minutes
[3:02:08] <jorniev> WAIT IS HE ONLY IN THIS OUT OF SPITE NOW?
[3:02:16] <%luckysteak> luckysteak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:02:32] <+wraithtaker162> the library's open in the mornings
[3:02:35] <Mnemonicjohnny> @PatStaresAt So I take it the flask you found behind the map-code safe must be worth a lot, right?
[3:02:36] <kazadaz> @boomerjuice beats complaining about the ads they watched
[3:02:41] <+wraithtaker162> it's got dope shit in the morning
[3:02:41] <%chiazam> I mean its not like he can do anything else except break the loop
[3:02:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @RubberFistFight ah, no. i meant in the way that outer wilds and this game handel fail states; the information you gained was more important than being perfect each loop
[3:02:49] <BlackStarAura> LIE-BARRY
[3:02:55] <Madinki> @jorniev Motivated by Prue Spite. Love to see it
[3:03:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> no prompts, that annoying
[3:03:20] <%hereiam407> This game moves, like no stalling for anything.
[3:03:23] <%Monkeyweed21> If Paige was in this scenario would it be called Deathloopus or Deathloop-uh
[3:03:36] <%Fooguwu> the Outer Wilds of Dishonored
[3:03:37] <MasterTonberry23> Spite is an excellent motivator
[3:03:45] <+BlueLeopard007> damn...
[3:03:48] <SaltyAzteca> fuckin moneeeeeey
[3:03:52] <Saltmeisterr> das alot
[3:03:56] <BurdRightsActivist> BIIIG RESIDIUM
[3:03:58] <Madinki> @Monkeyweed21 I like Deathloop-uh
[3:04:12] <%PhantomMiG> Does residuim respawn @patstaresat
[3:04:12] <%hereiam407> Blow it up
[3:04:18] <Saltmeisterr> boot?
[3:04:22] <%chiazam> Wait Julianna said Wenjie cracked it Day 7, but I thought the loop was stuck to Day 1
[3:04:23] <Treasure_Vault> Does it have an open window?
[3:04:24] <ergulor> do you have to re infuse weapons every loop or they're unlocked forever?
[3:04:25] <%TOONFOOD> autofill has been responsible for so many takeouts
[3:04:25] <+toastybites> maybe come back when someones home
[3:04:27] <MasterTonberry23> Did you try asking nicely?
[3:04:27] <%retrosadness> sound design seems real good
[3:04:33] <IminyourBase> the fool
[3:04:44] <%chiazam> explore every inch of the building then
[3:04:45] <Mnemonicjohnny> The TK power wouldn't work on that, right?  It only works on things made of meat, hence the name.
[3:04:50] <+BlueLeopard007> also whats the point of living in a loop if you cant remember each day you looped
[3:04:52] <+MisterAvry> yeah another streamer was kicking dudes off ledges a lot, can you do that yet?
[3:05:01] <+Havictos> @Madinki She's like a real life anime character she heven has her own verbal tic
[3:05:12] <%Piemen99> @MasterTonberry23 Is that a quote from somewhere it sounds familiar
[3:05:25] <%Broand> So if they don't keep their memories, why do they care that they're in a loop?
[3:05:31] <%G_Thunders> @blueleopard007 all the normal people think this is the loops First Day
[3:05:31] <kazadaz> Can you counter-hack while in Julianna mode?
[3:05:33] <+toastybites> the kick in this game is pretty op
[3:05:36] <%hereiam407> @Piemen99 Seinfeld?
[3:05:41] <jorniev> I LOVE THAT HACK THING
[3:05:43] <MasterTonberry23> @BlueLeopard007 Id say it has about as much meaning as living life normally Which is to say, none Kappa
[3:05:45] <+MisterAvry> maybe they didn't know that was part of the deal
[3:05:49] <+RadioSpirit> (dies)
[3:05:51] <akitanito> that's a lot of people
[3:05:54] <+wraithtaker162> time for the Whole Ass Cavalry
[3:05:58] <butthurtdave> wait i'm confused, where's the incest baby
[3:06:03] <thelonechris> There's so much happening rn
[3:06:08] <%Piemen99> @hereiam407 i guess?
[3:06:10] <MasterTonberry23> thats a lotta people, good thing theyre all dumb as hell
[3:06:12] <BurdRightsActivist> PATTTT your CHAOS THOO
[3:06:14] <Mnemonicjohnny> @BlueLeopard007 I think they got pitched the "idea" of an eternal party, but unless you're all juiced up on Residuum, you can't actually "experience" loops.
[3:06:19] <+dmbender> (dies) I think is my favorite subtitle
[3:06:23] <SaltyAzteca> LAMBS TO THE SLAUGHTER
[3:06:31] <HitchhikingThrough> oh man, those are some good sound bites
[3:06:35] <%Nekros4442> Wait...do you just have a dishonoured sword?
[3:06:37] <LoneFonte> "I'm the one!" (dies)
[3:06:38] <+MisterAvry> aww
[3:06:39] <SaltyAzteca> FECK
[3:06:44] <%hereiam407> Music bangin
[3:06:45] <DS_ShockTrooper> oof

[3:06:49] <+Shady_Zaku> RUH ROH got the snuck up ons
[3:06:49] <MasterTonberry23> Ha ha you died
[3:06:50] <Saltmeisterr> oh
[3:06:51] <HitchhikingThrough> these people have great combat barks
[3:06:53] <maybefalco> there goes all your residue stuff
[3:06:54] <Saltmeisterr> corpse run
[3:07:00] <%chiazam> wow thats brutal
[3:07:00] <Saltmeisterr> of course
[3:07:01] <+Javaa01> AWOOOGA
[3:07:01] <+BlueLeopard007> fair point @Mnemonicjohnny
[3:07:10] <maybefalco> oooo
[3:07:48] <DS_ShockTrooper> What does hacking the cameras do anything?
[3:07:50] <%chiazam> Wow there's so many left
[3:07:58] <%GarbageNirvana> So like are they all assassins then or
[3:08:08] <MasterTonberry23> Everybody dead. I like that
[3:08:11] <IminyourBase> the music lets you know you've killed everyone
[3:08:30] <+Soliloquy123> Oh wow I love how you can fire one-handed but can't pump
[3:08:35] <BlackStarAura> massacre
[3:08:40] <kazadaz> But Colt... I sell drugs to the community...
[3:08:42] <lloyddboy> neat detail on not pumping the shotty til your hand's free
[3:08:49] <Aoworth> So you're playing this BIG loud huh
[3:08:53] <%hereiam407> This reminds me of a James Bond game, like Nightfire
[3:08:54] <zenith0111> Is this actually good?
[3:08:59] <%hereiam407> Gadget hacking and the music
[3:09:01] <akitanito> nice
[3:09:26] <%chiazam> its better
[3:09:31] <%Nekros4442> @zenith0111 Just dont play on pc apparently
[3:09:46] <MasterTonberry23> Maybe someone stuck in a wall somewhere
[3:09:55] <+wraithtaker162> because of the denuvo thing?
[3:10:01] <+JaseAdrift> this music is great
[3:10:02] <kazadaz> Supposedly the PC version's better if you limit the frames to a multiple of 60
[3:10:25] <+Havictos> @Nekros4442 I checked on steam apparently drm fucked the pc version like usual it seems.
[3:10:26] <zenith0111> I can here the grunt oofing the distance
[3:10:33] <kazadaz> Fixes the frame pacing problems
[3:10:48] <zenith0111> @nekros4442 Wow.
[3:10:57] <AllenDeadman> makes sense
[3:10:57] <thelonechris> Peculiar
[3:11:01] <%Raikouija> r/gamingdetails eh? :P
[3:11:03] <Dunmarkh> dats immersive
[3:11:03] <butthurtdave> i like that reload animation lmao
[3:11:04] <jorniev> coool
[3:11:15] <kazadaz> It's one of those cases where there's denuvo but they can't tell if that's the cause of the problem, versus regular bad optimisation
[3:11:16] <+wraithtaker162> I'd use the spiker more if I could reliably get nails more often
[3:11:27] <+battle_of_the_meat> Pat would you recommend this game? I kinda want it.
[3:11:33] <%Broand> So wait, if you residium a gun, do you keep it for good?
[3:12:01] <Kurrisum> Yes
[3:12:04] <%G_Thunders> Arkane’s PC optimization has been pretty bad since Dishonored 2
[3:12:07] <butthurtdave> can you sell or breakdown gear for more?
[3:12:15] <%GarbageNirvana> You can burn guns to get more apparently?
[3:12:18] <+Jack8274> The character trinkets sell well
[3:12:38] <Meekest> Like forever forever or just until the next loop?
[3:12:43] <raikagelord1> So can you travel the whole Island and the reset at certain time?
[3:12:44] <MiamiMemory> NAILS
[3:12:50] <Meekest> Like do you need to collect 8k more residium next loop
[3:12:55] <IminyourBase> cheaty guns
[3:12:57] <Kurrisum> like forever
[3:12:57] <+Jack8274> Forever Forever
[3:12:58] <MiamiMemory> NAILS ARE FOREVER

[3:30:06] <Zebens> time to bully more children
[3:30:07] <%cooldude69xx> Isnt that the same?
[3:30:08] <+BigCoffee> because the multiplayer sucks ass
[3:30:09] <%AyotoCorp> Or a lot of people are invading and not enough are playing normal
[3:30:10] <%Fooguwu> the multiplayer seems bad
[3:30:11] <+JaseAdrift> people keep getting fucked so they tuen it off...LIKE COWARDS
[3:30:11] <jubejube56> This is the peak of the game's playerbase right?
[3:30:11] <%hereiam407> What are those fried balls of dough, its like a Greek food filled with beef?

[3:30:16] <MasterTonberry23> So yeah, multiplayer is dead
[3:30:18] <thelonechris> You killed a bunch of critics
[3:30:18] <Kingsgrave_> dont you also have to be in a specific part of a level to even be invaded
[3:30:19] <BepBepAmShep> multiplayer is kind of rough when you're just starting out
[3:30:19] <Wydamn> More likely almost everyone is playing Julianna and there's not enough Colts
[3:30:21] <+Havictos> yeah get those game journalists
[3:30:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Pfft
[3:30:28] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:30:28] <MasterTonberry23> Congrats Pat for killing all those games journalists
[3:30:31] <%greasypete00> youre probably a stupid high level compared to most people who just go tthe game
[3:30:31] <+kralec> @devanmuse from what Paige was saying, possibly Chlamydia.
[3:30:33] <kazadaz> Don't be ridiculous, there are no children with PS5s
[3:30:34] <+megaotter> hasnt been a self own on twitter like that since Ben Shapiro said his wife told him women don't get wet and it is unhealthy to

[3:31:47] <Al_aka_Fonz> @peachsaliva I think they were just called soda fountain shops
[3:31:51] <%athuramn> I wish this was crossplay
[3:31:54] <SaltyAzteca> was that the stun gun?
[3:31:55] <+battle_of_the_meat> Pat would you recommend this game?
[3:32:00] <jubejube56> And back to waiting
[3:32:01] <+JaseAdrift> @maskofmichael it just depends sometimes you get longer matches where the colt player is stealthing and trying his hardest not to dy
[3:32:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Ain't that what other him was wearing
[3:32:05] <akitanito> pat is santa claus, dying to give children presents
[3:32:08] <lloyddboy> GAS
[3:32:09] <MasterTonberry23> whats the point of cosmetics in a game where you never see yourself?
[3:32:10] <omniv_of_g0r> that coat looked like Mad Maxs' coat
[3:32:13] <%Fooguwu> 5 minute queues for 60 seconds of bad gameplay seems bad
[3:32:17] <+JackDandyTDV> Oh, costumes rewards are random? I'm lvl 20 and I don't have that second Colt costume.
[3:32:22] <%hereiam407> Malt shop?
[3:32:24] <MiamiMemory> @PatStaresAt  Does Canada have a national soft drink?
[3:32:25] <%hereiam407> ***
[3:32:32] <Wydamn> MasterTonberry23 to flex on yoru pvp opponents, and also style
[3:32:35] <+kralec> @MasterTonberry23 your opponent can see you, look good while you kill them.
[3:32:36] <Madinki> If everyone turned off the multiplayer doesn't that mean its already dead?
[3:32:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Spruce Beer
[3:32:39] <%ThomasOfTroy> Fuck no the US doesn't
[3:32:42] <%ThomasOfTroy> That's weird as shit
[3:32:45] <%Fooguwu> the multiplayer doesn't *look* fun though
[3:32:46] <devanmuse> Most of them?
[3:32:46] <Aoworth> Disgusting
[3:32:46] <%afronooch> Coke or Pepsi depending on where
[3:32:46] <jubejube56> Canada Dry
[3:32:47] <%cooldude69xx> Its coke right?
[3:32:48] <@GeneralSCPatton> Steel Lungs saved me from a gas trap puzzle room.
[3:32:49] <lloyddboy> Quebepis
[3:32:49] <kazadaz> The only people with a national soft drink are the scots
[3:32:50] <Jrocy247> Coke...
[3:32:51] <%hereiam407> Ice cream parlor
[3:32:52] <%Mattais88> Really?
[3:32:54] <%Paperware> BEPIS
[3:32:55] <+ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt We have Canada Dry
[3:32:56] <MasterTonberry23> @Wydamn @kralec that sounds really dumb and bad Kappa
[3:32:57] <DracaenaLeaf> coke > pepsi
[3:32:59] <+Nomenanza> @Madinki people would turn it back on most likely when they beat the game
[3:33:01] <+BigCoffee> what hellhole do people prefer pepsi here? It<s all about rootbeet
[3:33:01] <$realm_forge> Canada has maple syrup
[3:33:02] <Jrocy247> It's unfortunatelly Coke
[3:33:02] <maybefalco> barq's root beer is the best and no one else can tell me otherwise
[3:33:03] <xxshadowxx416> root beer
[3:33:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @PatStaresAt We do have Spruce Beer here in canada
[3:33:06] <Al_aka_Fonz> that's where they hung out in grease. malt shops
[3:33:09] <+BigCoffee> and cada dry
[3:33:09] <BurdRightsActivist> Over in my rez, they call it "Bepsi"
[3:33:15] <%chiazam> they should find a way to roll in some Colt AIs for progression
[3:33:16] <BlackStarAura> Damn, now I want a Canada Dry
[3:33:16] <+RemedyofRevenge> Julianna got some good drip
[3:33:17] <%Valdorick> I'm drinking Canada Dry right now.
[3:33:17] <%Archphronimos> Canada Dry is tasty shit
[3:33:19] <%polothegreatest> pepsi>coke
[3:33:20] <Psyramics> it probably depends on which brand is cheapest for restaurants in a particular region
[3:33:20] <mike2hands> me love canada dry
[3:33:20] <%Fooguwu> Vernors is way better!
[3:33:21] <+toastybites> they got sued for not having real ginger
[3:33:26] <Aoworth> #sponsored by Canada Dry
[3:33:28] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt yeah, that's not a national drink though, it's just a brand
[3:33:30] <%Fooguwu> canada dry doesnt even use real ginger
[3:33:30] <MoonlightWolves> So have we learned why she wants to kill colt? Or did they not care?
[3:33:35] <%Wallabri> gingerale suffers from it's proximity to "the drink you drink when you're sick"
[3:33:35] <Al_aka_Fonz> ok what's everyone's favorite ginger ale?
[3:33:36] <blitzmentalist> i like Vernor's more, personally, but Canada Dry is also good
[3:33:37] <%hereiam407> It's Clearly Canadian
[3:33:40] <BlackStarAura> good thing I just bought some CD
[3:33:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Confirmed 0% Ginger in Canada Dry
[3:33:43] <%Valdorick> Mix Cranberry Juice in with your Canada Dry
[3:33:44] <+megaotter> you cant drink a ginger ale anyway it's cannibalism
[3:33:46] <%athuramn> pop shoppe and presidents choice are also canadian
[3:33:48] <%Deekman> The answer is pamplemousse
[3:33:51] <Blank9> dr pepper is southern US's soda
[3:33:52] <+BigCoffee> Did you know Canada Dry has no ginger in it? Someone tried to sue them over it a while back .
[3:33:52] <MasterTonberry23> @MoonlightWolves he keeps leaving the seat up
[3:33:57] <%SpoonheadInExile> Has anyone here suffered the mispleasure of having their parents pack Ruby Red Squirt in their lunch during grade school?
[3:33:59] <%Bt_Robot> Isn't it Mountain Dew in America?  It's practically a way of life for some people
[3:34:00] <+fetrigon> @valdorick KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[3:34:02] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I didnt like Ginger ale until I flew to japan
[3:34:03] <mikeriffic> it feels like she just enjoys it
[3:34:04] <MoonlightWolves> lol
[3:34:04] <%NeoCre> Vernors is clearly the superior ginger ale.
[3:34:05] <Al_aka_Fonz> cannibalism?
[3:34:12] <kazadaz> Have you gotten any MP outside Updaam zone?
[3:34:12] <MiamiMemory> @Blank9  Cheerwine?
[3:34:17] <%PyroOptional> i didnt even know about this game until this stream
[3:34:18] <%Raikouija> I couldnt figure out what type of game this was tbh
[3:34:18] <%hereiam407> @BigCoffee If Pat puts his dick in it, will it have a little ginger?
[3:34:19] <xxshadowxx416> is pat a Canada dry
[3:34:21] <%ThomasOfTroy> I don't like ginger ale
[3:34:25] <%Archphronimos> @NeoCre you're not wrong
[3:34:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Al_aka_Fonz Pat is Giner/Red haired
[3:34:26] <%SaiyanShoto> I haven't had a soda in like 3 years
[3:34:29] <Zebens> I've never even heard of Death Loop until I saw this stream
[3:34:31] <Khester824> does this have team deathmatch?
[3:34:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Ginger, fuck
[3:34:32] <Al_aka_Fonz> oh ginger

[3:34:39] <%greasypete00> ever had philips soft drinks or alcoholic beverages
[3:34:41] <scrumbotime> Pat is Canada Wet, a slippery seal of a man
[3:34:41] <+JaseAdrift> this game's marketing taught me that there is such a thing as too much marketing
[3:34:43] <Al_aka_Fonz> I got it a second too late
[3:34:44] <%Valdorick> Pat is a Canada Wet
[3:34:46] <ThePeacefulDream> Hell yeah, Snapshot King their ass.
[3:34:46] <akitanito> pls no moist pat
[3:34:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat wants to be covered in delousing powder
[3:34:48] <+BigCoffee> Anyway folks avoid canada dry
[3:34:49] <%athuramn> he's got too much drip
[3:34:51] <+BigCoffee> it has no ginger in it
[3:34:51] <%dekkitout> @Bt_Robot Compared to Coke, ya know the thing in every movie scene that is in Times Square, New York
[3:34:51] <%Deekman> How could you not?!
[3:34:52] <+fetrigon> picari sweat
[3:34:53] <raikagelord1> So your not gonna play anymore? Or are you like gonna let people just buy it and play.
[3:34:53] <Blank9> @MiamiMemory I've never even seen cheerwine outside of a float, but it rules there.
[3:34:54] <+BigCoffee> despite beign a ginder ale
[3:34:54] <jubejube56> I don't understand how they showed this game so many times yet people didn't know this was a thing
[3:34:54] <+MisterAvry> how do you feel about cream soda?
[3:34:54] <churropoppa> just don't sweat. duh
[3:34:57] <homestylewaffles> Canada Sure
[3:35:01] <BurdRightsActivist> I honestly thought the game was a battle royale up until you told me what it was. Thanks trailers.
[3:35:02] <MiamiMemory> Canada Moist
[3:35:02] <Al_aka_Fonz> brunette ale anyone?
[3:35:03] <+TheAdMerlin> I'm not going to imagine moist pat no matter how much you try
[3:35:05] <ErikFeral> Canada Dry is an IRL Health Potion. Heals and Cures Disease
[3:35:06] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Bring some to the next con in never from now
[3:35:07] <%Murimlol> aren't you sweating most of the time
[3:35:07] <mr_saturday93> so pat sweats 90 percent of the time
[3:35:08] <+BigCoffee> Canada Sour
[3:35:10] <+skeletonmilk> NOT MILK
[3:35:10] <%Paperware> What about Ginger Beer?
[3:35:11] <%Valdorick> Just cover yourself in aluminum
[3:35:14] <raikagelord1> Human swear or drink sweat?
[3:35:16] <%hereiam407> You aint got no liquids Lt. Dan
[3:35:17] <belias21> i just ran out and bought it as a result of this stream. so you have at least one sale that can be accredited to you kind sir.
[3:35:17] <%Fooguwu> ginger would be a horrible word to accidentally typo badly
[3:35:18] <+RemedyofRevenge> Thats why they call it "bone dry" @PatStaresAt
[3:35:18] <%SaiyanShoto> I don't sweat I just get really hot, I'd rather sweat
[3:35:20] <+fetrigon> *pocari
[3:35:23] <marcomatame> i mean Pat at least you live in Canada, it's 30C+ and humid most of the year over here
[3:35:23] <%jinking79> still got Bone Juice

[3:35:27] <+MisterAvry> Pat the Lich
[3:35:28] <studleydoorite> liquids leave my body once a day usually
[3:35:29] <%GarbageNirvana> So correct me if I'm wrong but both these main characters are black, right
[3:35:30] <%cade_calrayn> I'm guessing it was a *lewd* look
[3:35:33] <%Valdorick> No, like, anti-perspirant
[3:35:37] <+fetrigon> nah just aluminum
[3:35:39] <%Monkeyweed21> I thought this games FPS hotline Miami/Katana Zero
[3:35:40] <Man_in_the_Red> just take a bath in molten aluminum
[3:35:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Cover yourself in the same pain as that one person in Goldfinger
[3:35:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> paint

[3:36:20] <%GarbageNirvana> @Madinki Just nice to see is all, hardly get to
[3:36:28] <smoothwood07> remember when sierra mist with cranberry was a i thing?
[3:36:32] <MiamiMemory> Gief is a def a fan of A&W
[3:36:37] <+RemedyofRevenge> Zangief in bloodborne would be Treat-Starved Beast
[3:36:40] <%maskofmichael> WHY'D HE BITE ME
[3:36:42] <%hereiam407> It's gonna get colder farther south, than a hell of a lot hotter
[3:36:47] <Al_aka_Fonz> once I realized it was just dishonored with different gameplay I was sold
[3:36:54] <%dekkitout> Sierra mist cranberry? You mean sprite?
[3:36:54] <RubberFistFight> HE'S A MANIAC
[3:36:55] <marcomatame> @TheBitingIrish that sucks, Canada is supposed to be safe from this garbage
[3:36:58] <+TheAdMerlin> Gief likes MUG
[3:37:14] <+HaunchPaunch> You would probably find more matches if Sony sold anymore PS5's!
[3:37:20] <+RemedyofRevenge> the FOV feels so close
[3:37:30] <+TheBitingIrish> I think Gief is more of a Barq's kinda dog Kappa
[3:37:36] <%hereiam407> Pat should play a Dog's Life on gif's birthday
[3:37:44] <%hereiam407> gief's*
[3:37:45] <marcomatame> but, what IS Deathloop?
[3:37:49] <Al_aka_Fonz> I'm 99% sure it was cranberry ginger ale
[3:37:53] <studleydoorite> I'm having trouble seeing the gun through the landscape, they should tone it down
[3:37:54] <%CzeekyTV> Sony has literally outsold all previous PS consoles
[3:37:58] <RubberFistFight> @TheBitingIrish Where exactly was that temperature recorded, would be my question. Since there's spots on the earth's surface that routinely get to 50 and have done for a veeeeery long time.

[3:41:50] <MoonlightWolves> Very black dynomite
[3:41:50] <RubberFistFight> @TheBitingIrish So doing some research, apparently the spot the temperature gauge was located is questionable. Additionally that area is historically surrounded by a heat bubble that forms in somewhere called Fraser Valley

[3:44:22] <RubberFistFight> @TheBitingIrish IDK man, i'm seeing people saying it hits about that hot with regularity because that area is in a string of arid deserts and surrounded by rocky canyons, which WOULD amplify the heating. As well as westerlies contributing adiabatic heating.
[3:44:26] <%YakumoYomi> @Gorgs7 He did. He streamed it.
[3:44:32] <%bravebravesrobin> yeah! duck those kids...

[3:46:27] <+JaseAdrift> this is a sneaky colt
[3:46:28] <+MisterAvry> The worst thing about a time loop would be waking up with a headache or painful shits on the morning of the loop.
[3:46:41] <DS_ShockTrooper> Its both
[3:46:49] <%baka_sugoi> psaBlind
[3:46:49] <%hereiam407> That gun look sickkkkk
[3:46:51] <Saltmeisterr> @tehbeardedbard pve with dark souls invasions
[3:46:58] <RubberFistFight> @MisterAvry like that episode of Stargate where Teal'C starts each loop with a door being opened into his face.
[3:46:58] <+Dannzzyy> He is afk taking a sh*t
[3:47:02] <%chiazam> i heard him.....
[3:47:03] <@ssjklyco> Did he AFK?
[3:47:06] <SaltyAzteca> Sneak 100 Colt
[3:47:07] <Visorak6> Is there a risk of warping into someone's session that's at the end of the game and mega spoiling yourself?
[3:47:08] <Dunmarkh> maybe he's afk
[3:47:13] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[3:47:15] <Mirrorcatch> doing a ghost run perhaps
[3:47:16] <%baka_sugoi> both are blind

[3:47:47] <Mnemonicjohnny> I can see why Pissing Mikhail had that "Revenant" song stuck in his head
[3:47:51] <+RemedyofRevenge> maybe he's doing a pacifist run in the hope that he doesnt raise his chaos
[3:47:55] <Mnemonicjohnny> shit's catchy.
[3:47:55] <jorniev> what was that guitar riff
[3:48:09] <%chiazam> oh shit

[3:51:56] <Goldenwolf98> ooooof
[3:51:56] <%dekkitout> This is why I turn vibration the fuck off
[3:51:58] <%Monkeyweed21> crafting piss
[3:51:58] <+Havictos> keep that shit plugged in
[3:51:59] <%hereiam407> How do they feel though?
[3:52:05] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yeah the haptics on those controller need to have their power use moderated a bit better i think.
[3:52:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> That sucks
[3:52:11] <HakunaGrakata> are the haptics well done?
[3:52:13] <Frade> lmao
[3:52:13] <@ssjklyco> I reallly wish controller battery got better and not worse every gen
[3:52:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> THe PS5 says the battery is low?
[3:52:17] <jcflyguy> Did it heat up?
[3:52:18] <Psyramics> i keep a charging cable by my couch cause of shit like this
[3:52:20] <%polothegreatest> dont used haptic, got it
[3:52:21] <Man_in_the_Red> almost like Haptic Feedback is a wastful gimmick
[3:52:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> damn
[3:52:33] <$tehbeardedbard> does it charge and play  alight ?
[3:52:35] <%toolofparanoia> GIEF IS MAKIN PISS
[3:52:37] <Explodincatz> the cost of the gimic
[3:52:38] <+MisterAvry> hah, let me take you back to the Game Gear days
[3:52:40] <@ssjklyco> The switch pro controller last for fucking ever
[3:52:42] <%hereiam407> Waiting for graphene batteries some day
[3:52:43] <@commanderclaw> Please be good Graphene batteries, I'm begging you
[3:52:43] <%afronooch> you get hit with ps5 drift?
[3:52:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> But we make them do more things
[3:52:45] <%CatastropheCorvid> Battery isn't worse, the features are just more demanding.
[3:52:46] <Goldenwolf98> Elite Series 2 has a decent battery
[3:52:46] <+kralec> They could make a better battery, they choose not to for MONEY!
[3:52:46] <%hereiam407> @PatStaresAt Did you imply that Deathloop would be connected to Prey via the Transtar reference they removed, that you mentioned earlier?
[3:52:47] <$tehbeardedbard> oh well lol
[3:52:50] <%Arweynn> what are your triggers set to? I had to turn mine down to weak, because of the vibration on automatic  weapons
[3:52:51] <Psyramics> yeah, I charge and play all the time
[3:52:51] <F_manS> I guess the one good thing about the ps5 shortage is that we don't have to worry about early adoption woes.
[3:52:53] <kazadaz> Honestly worth it
[3:53:02] <+Lillowh> The xbox elite controller and the switch controller have great battery life, it's just sony that has made shit controllers since the ps4
[3:53:03] <xbb1024> there's a shortage on battery materials
[3:53:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @afronooch is that a thing now? Oh no
[3:53:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> Try having a DualSense but no PS5 for firmware updates.
[3:53:08] <%hewlettfan96> they could make a bette battery but more monies for Sony hehehe
[3:53:09] <tanarath> Using two slow-reacting chemicals is a shitty idea for batteries.
[3:53:14] <%sporeian94> i'll wait for it to get patched into a better state on PC/piracy drainage removed
[3:53:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Does it use a USB-C cable or the old Mini-USB? @PatStaresAt
[3:53:26] <Sofa_King_Hype> That's why I keep a battery bank
[3:53:27] <RubberFistFight> yeah lithium battery tech is plateauing a bit at the moment. Especially portable ones. Right now device manufacturers need to focus on making power use more efficient.
[3:53:31] <$ImExtremelyManly> that would be amazing
[3:53:32] <%albobomb> This game looks so sick
[3:53:32] <Astrophizz> reminds me of The Prisoner
[3:53:34] <jorniev> is there a Dishonored reference?
[3:53:36] <jcflyguy> Well I'm way more interested in this game than I was 6 hours ago.
[3:53:38] <%Monkeyweed21> I NEED to see a whale carcass in Deathloop
[3:53:38] <Man_in_the_Red> buissiness at usual for Arkane then
[3:53:39] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt There is mention of the outside world but they just keep saying it's shithole somehow but nothing specific
[3:53:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> So far they've only referenced the world being fucked in some way.
[3:53:41] <jtsoppy137> over market
[3:53:41] <@ssjklyco> It was even on sale BEFORE it came out on PSN
[3:53:41] <tanarath> it's great
[3:53:44] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I ain't buying that shit on PC right now for the problems it apparently has
[3:53:46] <+sonofrobin73> Marketed badly AND the PC version is bad
[3:53:46] <Psyramics> cause its not Call of Duty
[3:53:47] <%Agami23> also its only really on ps5 and no one can get ps5s
[3:53:50] <%maskofmichael> A FPS?
[3:53:50] <%SaiyanShoto> Marketed it so much that people are actually turned off by it. Like me
[3:53:52] <Goldenwolf98> they marketed to much and not at all LUL
[3:53:53] <%hereiam407> I want to buy this game, but no PS5 or good graphics card
[3:54:03] <+MisterAvry> also hard for word of mouth because the spoilers start early
[3:54:04] <%NeoCre> @lillowh calling the PS4 controller shit? Nah, not when I’ve felt how trash the XBONE controller is
[3:54:09] <%hewlettfan96> cause its destroyed by COD and battlefield
[3:54:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's like Bulletstorm
[3:54:13] <%Agami23> invisible wars was shit though
[3:54:13] <%maskofmichael> Why would a First-Person Shooter sell bad?
[3:54:14] <%sporeian94> deus ex died for avengers, remember that
[3:54:15] <Zantetzuken> wolfenstein
[3:54:15] <tanarath> BOXES
[3:54:18] <Man_in_the_Red> that checks out
[3:54:20] <Goldenwolf98> oh god thats rough LUL
[3:54:21] <%ThomasOfTroy> Wasn't invisible war bad?

[3:54:31] <%SaiyanShoto> I'm not listening to a man who hates Banjo and Kazooie about people having bad taste
[3:54:32] <%hereiam407> Invisible War sucked
[3:54:33] <%topendbuzza> before I buy this game I need a ps5 1st
[3:54:35] <Psyramics> its not Call of Duty, its not Madden or FIFA 20xx, its not a F2P BR, its going to sell like shit
[3:54:38] <+Havictos> Stupid dumbasses just want multiplayer shooter crap
[3:54:38] <Man_in_the_Red> Thief and System Shock might be the only ones that profited by a significant margin
[3:54:42] <@ssjklyco> Their games tend to go around $10 really quickly.
[3:54:42] <%Valdorick> Invisible War was REALLY BAD
[3:54:51] <%RealThiele> honestly the writing had becoem garbage
[3:54:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Mankind Divided sold like over a million but it didnt sell 5 million
[3:54:57] <lloyddboy> GIVE EM BIONICLE

[4:00:18] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt if you spend a lot of time indoors, your neurotransmitters can get dodgy. Phototherapy lamps mimic sunlight so that you don't get the winter blues and stuff.
