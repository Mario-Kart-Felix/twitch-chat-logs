[0:13:52] <+ElizzGlaster> @AngriestPat how has your dungeon experiences been so far? I have run into tanks that don't know how to tank, healers still trying to dps, dps not using aoe's on large groups, and I just got kicked out of the level 73 dungeon when i told the party brb, and was only gone for at the most 3 minutes to take an important phone call
[0:13:56] <tragicjohnson84> Is this the golden age of video games for Pat?

[0:14:18] <%Typhaeon> Healers should be trying to do damage
[0:14:28] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat who do you main in SamSho or have you not put enough time in it yet to know?
[0:14:31] <BunnyEmperor> Basically Pat's Titania trial
[0:14:32] <%Cardz_> SourPls
[0:14:38] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat GarlondTools got updated btw
[0:14:41] <%weissguard> LUL
[0:14:41] <+OnyxMemory> Healers are supposed to dps lol
[0:14:45] <tealwolf26> Do it though Kappa
[0:14:48] <dekkitout> That sequence was sick as shit
[0:14:52] <MoonObscure> assholes?
[0:14:57] <BunnyEmperor> Normies? DansGame
[0:15:02] <%VioletHeart> Healers are super supposed to do DPS, as long as they don't let the party die.
[0:15:04] <jackythefrost> Yesterday pat ran into a healer who refused to heal, shit was bad
[0:15:05] <CaptainFrankincense> healers ADJUST
[0:15:14] <%Spaaaankers> Time to bring the shadows
[0:15:15] <%VioletHeart> Assuming not letting people die is possible with the size of the pull/enemies/etc.
[0:15:23] <%Typhaeon> If you think it's bad now, wait for the actual launch
[0:15:26] <%Fenrirlives> Hey Pat!
[0:15:31] <neondeon69> nice haircut
[0:15:37] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> ive seen a TON of Legends and Ultimate Legends too
[0:15:54] <%thelaxinator> I had a leviathan hard yesterday where 6 people died at once and we still pulled it out and got to full party to beat the second phase
[0:15:57] <BunnyEmperor> Not if they intend to lvl up the other jobs...
[0:16:09] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat the worst part is that new mechanics tend to come from raids/24-man raids cirISee
[0:16:19] <tragicjohnson84> I like the Ocelot hat
[0:16:20] <%jessedouglas> poifect
[0:16:21] <%Typhaeon> Levels seem good
[0:16:23] <jackythefrost> Its good
[0:16:24] <%Faustgesicht> you know, Morons
[0:16:25] <%ElenaManetta> Too competitive to play with friends, not competitive to play with experts
[0:16:34] <%ArcanumMBD> What chest armor glamour is that?
[0:16:39] <%weissguard> Alex Valle: Who? LUL
[0:16:48] <ZaibatsuFan> Did you see Jebailey get choked by a gamecube controller?
[0:16:48] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat just tried out new SMN, love the increased skill ceiling, but I don't know how to deal with constant enemy aggro! advice?
[0:16:57] <%Cardz_> crocs
[0:17:20] <BunnyEmperor> The old shit carries all the way to 80
[0:17:28] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> do you mean tanks arent holding aggro?
[0:17:54] <%trillmagical> lmap
[0:17:56] <Laycas49> Anybody in chat tried Gunblade?
[0:18:04] <%thelaxinator> scholar can heal real good now but is boring as hell
[0:18:07] <dekkitout> I don't play this and even I know tanks should always have aggro and make space
[0:18:09] <Shaotanzhiten> Yeeah....if the tank is losing aggro, that's not anything on you, it means they're not tanking so good
[0:18:14] <jackythefrost> You can just spam AoE's now too
[0:18:14] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> tank aggro is ridiculous
[0:18:14] <CaptainFrankincense> its not even a problem anymore
[0:18:17] <%Ataraxis9> it is crazy how much easier now
[0:18:17] <%Fenrirlives> soloing right now, I used to get Titan Egi to draw enemy attention alot
[0:18:19] <+RushUnplugged> not me but my friend is really loving GNB
[0:18:27] <jackythefrost> AoE's are entirely free now
[0:18:28] <BunnyEmperor> If the tank loses aggro he is not attacking the enemy... LUL
[0:18:33] <tragicjohnson84> What's your in-game doggo's name

[0:19:39] <+ner0romanov> why would a tank care about damage? i have enough stress just making sure to do my job right.
[0:19:43] <%weissguard> It has a chonky butt.\
[0:19:54] <Shaotanzhiten> People always want to be big damage boys, even when they're not meant to be big damage boys...
[0:20:06] <AscheRichard> Is this game account easy to use? I wanna buy it but i gotta get a square enix account and IDK if i'll be able to pay with steam cards
[0:20:08] <Shaotanzhiten> When really people just appreciate if you do your job well
[0:20:09] <MSN04_Sazabi> It's more like a K-cut
[0:20:23] <thwak> it's more of a t-cut
[0:20:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wait did they get a dog to replace Elmo, I will riot
[0:20:55] <+EastwindGuru> So what class is Pat right now?

[0:22:50] <%Bigbossman91> @ner0romanov No you do need a character at lvl 60/70 to unlock Gunbreaker/Dancer

[0:25:39] <BunnyEmperor> tbf its not his body
[0:25:48] <Shaotanzhiten> I mean sure, they can't kill the guy, but guards could at least be like 'Yo, this guy sure is in the middle of town'

[0:29:42] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat imagine being a new player and getting to this point and seeing a player with the mogstation coat of his LUL
[0:29:49] <+EastwindGuru> Pat's character is straight up giga beef-lord
[0:30:01] <count_bob> Minifelia is just like "Who was that guy?"
[0:30:22] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> but i dont want to talk to the ghost in my hotel room
[0:30:27] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@PinkSuprende) (warning)
[0:30:44] <+EastwindGuru> I'm surprised that Pat is playing with controller.
[0:30:51] <%PinkSuprende> Go to sleep Akira. Let's not do that right now.
[0:31:13] <%Cervantas> ....
[0:31:18] <%dreamfillah> MMO menus with a controller???
[0:31:18] <%Cervantas> mmos are meant to be played with mouse and keyboard
[0:31:23] <HonestHero> I thought only Woolie played with Controllers?
[0:31:28] <+EastwindGuru> I mean, I feel like Ive heard you talk about it on the Podcast but you're such a big PC boi.
[0:31:36] <dredshift> Is this supposed to be the final expansion?
[0:31:40] <BunnyEmperor> they made it actually incredibly well with controller
[0:31:46] <suikudo> This game plays like ass on mouse and keyboard
[0:31:49] <%TysonPG> as someone who barely used a controller in the last 7 years, this game is PERFECT for a controller
[0:31:49] <KatabolicRage> the mouse and keyboard support is as fine as any other mmo
[0:31:55] <+Xalgar> Pat is slowly becoming Woolie with his controller choices LUL
[0:32:01] <wrightlight94> i also like playing FF 14 on controller
[0:32:07] <@Squishy3> its standard m/kb controls but the controller support is exceptional
[0:32:07] <%NWR_James> Pat did you ever play 12? Was it also gamepad centric since it started on PS2?
[0:32:10] <HonestHero> Do people play MMOS on consoles?
[0:32:15] <+Promessa_EX> koopy
[0:32:16] <+Williamld> Nope, it's designed for mouse and keyboard or that Hori monstrosity
[0:32:16] <%VioletHeart> It plays fine on a mouse and keyboard but boy is it more enjoyable on a controller.
[0:32:21] <MSN04_Sazabi> Pat is a fake PC user, he's actually a console babby
[0:32:30] <MSN04_Sazabi> Don't believe his lies
[0:32:31] <%ryome> MMOs don’t have a final anything unless they die
[0:32:31] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Scare the pat
[0:32:38] <+RushUnplugged> the game is designed to be also played on PS4 and the controller support is excellent
[0:32:42] <%weissguard> And now I'm hungry.
[0:32:47] <%tyler274> ff11 has a story conclusion
[0:32:48] <dekkitout> Is that specter your friend?
[0:32:49] <+EastwindGuru> Look at this highly armored KH character
[0:32:49] <%tyler274> ff14 will too
[0:32:52] <count_bob> Ghost: "I want a sammich."
[0:32:58] <HonestHero> @rushunplugged That’s actually pretty cool and flexible for a MMO
[0:33:03] <%tyler274> ShB is taking us to the 80% on the way to that conclusion
[0:33:04] <%Bigbossman91> @NWR_James Don't you mean 11? 12 isn't an MMO
[0:33:10] <%NWR_James> Yeah i meant 11
[0:33:17] <%tyler274> after that its content and updates, but the story we started with has an ending
[0:33:28] <+RushUnplugged> @HonestHero it's scary how easy it is to actually switch from one to the other too
[0:33:40] <%dreamfillah> Mmo menus with controllers, that sounds like the most asinine thing t. played 10 years of WoW, GW2 on and off and a little bit of Neverwinter
[0:34:02] <@Squishy3> there's completely different ui options between m/kb and controller in this game
[0:34:05] <%tyler274> because most mmos have shit design
[0:34:27] <@Squishy3> pressing start just gives you a menu with everything in it instead of relying on the menu keybinds
[0:34:31] <Katorskay> He likes to play Trading card games
[0:34:32] <SailingSaturn> cirPls
[0:34:32] <+Xalgar> @dreamfillah FFXIV has really good controller support, definitely wouldn't play WoW with one though unless they removed backpedaling LUL
[0:34:40] <%NWR_James> Did Paige just throw up?
[0:34:49] <BunnyEmperor> It sounded like it
[0:35:02] <%dreamfillah> also I wager this is the best MMO on the market, if only Final Fantasy wasn't my least favourite RPG setting
[0:35:02] <%TheCrispyBoi> he big boy now
[0:35:04] <dredshift> Pat got the creeper smile
[0:35:13] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> its all fun and games until the ghost in your hotel room asks about your pets
[0:35:14] <%dreamfillah> and the anime aesthetic
[0:35:16] <+Xalgar> I don't understand at ALL how people can stand healing with a controller
[0:35:18] <SailingSaturn> Awww they're bonding cirLove
[0:35:22] <%Maids4lyfe> apatElmo
[0:35:23] <jackythefrost> Its really cool they are giving Ardbert this much development even though he only showed up in the butt end of Heavensward

[0:36:17] <%tyler274> @Xalgar you use up and down on dpad to target party members
[0:36:21] <%tyler274> them it clicks back to enemy
[0:36:26] <%tyler274> rinse repeat
[0:36:31] <%NWR_James> I don't get how I keep putting on weight when ghosts keep making the food disappear
[0:36:32] <BunnyEmperor> Pat when you see who the crystal exarch is you gonna flip
[0:36:44] <%Suchawus> I think its supposed to reference the Fey area

[0:37:11] <+RushUnplugged> practical reasons over moral
[0:37:17] <+Xalgar> @tyler274 I dunno, it just seems really unoptimal compared to Mouseover Macros and 12 button mouse
[0:37:22] <%shadybarman> Pat the hat looks good with this armor but looked like shit on the set you ended the stream with yesterday.
[0:37:29] <%Suchawus> you get <The Fey-Touched> as a title for it
[0:37:47] <%tyler274> game is on a 2.5s gcd
[0:37:49] <%dreamfillah> if only this game wasn't Final Fantasy
[0:37:50] <%tyler274> i got plenty of time

[0:38:20] <BunnyEmperor> his only intention is to be a cuntbag
[0:38:24] <%weissguard> Patron just DansGame
[0:38:30] <@Squishy3> @Xalgar people do endgame raiding on controllers, so its totally viable, its just different
[0:38:30] <Vivalabonte> He sounds like a reptile.
[0:38:35] <%shurtal> Look it's a completely sane, not evil person
[0:38:37] <Sol_Install> this is the hardest X to doubt I've ever seen
[0:38:39] <@Squishy3> if you aren't used to it of course it'll feel weird
[0:38:41] <%tyler274> you can have muscle memory on a controller
[0:38:45] <dredshift> The lip flaps are surprisingly good
[0:38:45] <%Bigbossman91> Man he's such a wannabe Ardyn
[0:38:46] <%NWR_James> I love how the WOL responds to every phrase by menacingly stepping forward
[0:38:49] <+Xalgar> I'm an old ass WoW player so of course I'm biased
[0:39:13] <suikudo> Thancred has the right to be the most pissed about him being here
[0:39:18] <jackythefrost> XIV was made with controller in mind
[0:39:38] <%tyler274> mouse and keyboard players get pissed because abilities need to be prunned for controller
[0:39:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> He is tipping the scales all the way to the other direction...
[0:39:41] <%Valdorick> Swag coat
[0:39:43] <Arth__> gonna get this game, btw Shadowbringers adds all content right?
[0:39:44] <%tyler274> but the games intended for controller
[0:39:48] <+tigerfang86> eh
[0:39:51] <%tyler274> Kappa
[0:39:57] <%Gogogolem> I dont know man you got a real punchable face.
[0:40:27] <BunnyEmperor> LUL
[0:40:31] <+EastwindGuru> It's all fun and games until (plot twist) and you realize you were the bad guy all along.
[0:40:36] <BunnyEmperor> get outta ma house
[0:40:40] <@Squishy3> most of the button removal in this expac was because of redundancies more than ability bloat, lol
[0:40:45] <%tyler274> playing mmos also fucks my hands now
[0:40:45] <+Williamld> It's the Exarch's, not your's, you squatter
[0:40:50] <+Xalgar> @jackythefrost Yeah, like DPS and Tanking with a controller is comfy with some modifications, but healing seems like it'd be really easy to mess up, also how do you swap from targeting party members to DPS then switch back to heal again?
[0:40:50] <%tyler274> just cant do it anymore
[0:40:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> Emet was the Uber Eats guy
[0:40:51] <Adaruan> this story would seem weird if you haven't raided anything before this expensaion. like "you did cross all my plans". No I didn't
[0:40:53] <%tyler274> so i use controller
[0:40:55] <%ProtagonistJake> He just Kingdom hearts villained out of there
[0:41:04] <BunnyEmperor> and gave you a villain monolgue while youre taking a shit
[0:41:05] <@Squishy3> @Xalgar dpad does enemy/party switching
[0:41:07] <Vanslainstreams> He'd scare the shit out of you then
[0:41:09] <%tyler274> you swap back automatically
[0:41:13] <@Squishy3> up/down for enemies, left/right for parties iirc
[0:41:19] <+Promessa_EX> can this be played in japanese
[0:41:19] <%tyler274> reverse
[0:41:21] <+Xalgar> @Squishy3 OH SHIT you're right
[0:41:23] <%tyler274> left right for enemies
[0:41:26] <%weissguard> "Everything come out okay?"
[0:41:28] <%tyler274> up down for party members
[0:41:40] <%tyler274> if you target an ememy and up/down ytou can one cast
[0:41:40] <jackythefrost> @Xalgar The D-Pad, Left and right switches between mobs, up and down switch between party members
[0:41:41] <@Squishy3> i'd argue targeting individual party members is easier on controller than m/kb, honestly
[0:41:43] <%tyler274> then it swaps back
[0:41:58] <%tyler274> it feels real nice
[0:42:03] <SailingSaturn> LUL
[0:42:06] <Ner234> How is Pat the tallest person in the room?
[0:42:11] <+Xalgar> Guys, I'm getting 3 @'s all telling me the same thing, chill lol
[0:42:12] <@Squishy3> because you can set the party list priority, so you can have tanks at the top, then the others below them
[0:42:19] <snowmanse> The exarch is 3 lalafells on top of each other's shoulders.
[0:42:29] <jackythefrost> I didn't see the other @'s srry
[0:42:30] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@JSebz) (warning)
[0:42:41] <@Squishy3> and most of the time dps/other healer don't need spot heals and can be covered by aoe healing
[0:43:29] <%tyler274> when you up/down target party members you lock the target with select/A
[0:43:40] <%Valdorick> "She just screams "TAKE OFF YOUR DAMN HOOD YOU JACKASS!" anytime she sees me"
[0:43:41] <%tyler274> if you dont it does the swap back after next cast. to clarify
[0:43:41] <suikudo> He tried flirting with her
[0:43:44] <+Xalgar> Why is Minfillias dress thing suctioned to her uh, bosom?
[0:43:49] <%NWR_James> Narrator: "It was a lot of trouble"
[0:43:55] <%Kirijuo> Holy shot he got invited to smash

[0:44:03] <Ner234> needest thouest
[0:44:05] <%Divryne> HELL YEAH.
[0:44:06] <suikudo> Oh shit a smash invite!
[0:44:07] <+Artemis_Scowl> hahaha
[0:44:08] <+Glyceroll> crystal exarch in smash would be hype af
[0:44:08] <KatabolicRage> people have 100% been photoshopping the smash logo onto that letter
[0:44:14] <dekkitout> Wow
[0:44:16] <%ElenaManetta> Poor Waluigi
[0:44:16] <BunnyEmperor> Dude given that he can play any role it would work
[0:44:17] <Vivalabonte> PAT IN SMASH
[0:44:18] <jackythefrost> SMASH
[0:44:19] <JSebz> The Crystal Exarch gets summoned!
[0:44:19] <count_bob> That's a fucking reveal.
[0:44:20] <corrosivePaladin> Thats just Cloud's letter
[0:44:23] <%TysonPG> PATRON FOR SMASH
[0:44:24] <+Williamld> Nintendo invented wax seals :)
[0:44:25] <%tyler274> Y;shtola in smash when
[0:44:29] <%NWR_James> Square Enix would let them get THREE songs
[0:44:31] <%VantomPayne> Crystal Exarch Teleport Into the Competition!
[0:44:42] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@IncredibleMeh) (warning)
[0:44:43] <+TheImmortal70> Since Yshtola is i dissidia, which scion gets to be in smash?
[0:44:56] <+TheImmortal70> Or would it be Ardbert?
[0:44:58] <suikudo> Did you guys see Zenos get added to Dissidia?
[0:45:03] <%VantomPayne> Godbert
[0:45:04] <BunnyEmperor> Jokes on us, this was actually a subliminal confirmation that he will be one of the DLC characters Kappa
[0:45:20] <%tyler274> yoshi p wants 14 on switch
[0:45:30] <suikudo> The entire trailer is just Zenos beating the shit out of Y'shtola
[0:45:31] <%tyler274> its not impossible
[0:45:55] <+Xalgar> So how's the Trust system?
[0:46:01] <BunnyEmperor> It is possible when warframe works on it
[0:46:01] <%tyler274> Trusts are great but slow
[0:46:11] <%KingGuthorm> KingGuthorm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! apatDab
[0:46:20] <+meatgeneral69> ran'jit is so cool
[0:46:22] <KatabolicRage> trust will not AOE or do large pulls
[0:46:37] <BunnyEmperor> Trust is great to learn the dungeon smooth and nice, since the NPCs show you how to do the mechanics
[0:46:38] <%ArcanumMBD> You get less loot drops from Trust, but you get all the drops that do happen
[0:46:39] <@Squishy3> takes about 10 minutes longer
[0:46:41] <Saunt> 1/4 the loot
[0:46:44] <Saunt> iirc
[0:46:50] <czeekyplays> This music Kreygasm
[0:46:57] <jackythefrost> Trusts also require you to know how to play your job so if you're shit you cant be carried
[0:46:57] <%Kain5707> its technically for story
[0:47:01] <%rdark_ksu> tiny sneezes
[0:47:04] <%tyler274> it takes longer than 10 minutes more
[0:47:04] <%PinkSuprende> It's about half the loot
[0:47:06] <%tyler274> that shits slow
[0:47:08] <%Faustgesicht> shame about the first run bonuses tho
[0:47:09] <%PinkSuprende> But you get all of it
[0:47:09] <Vanslainstreams> the trust system is good for when you know you can do a run before needed to do something else, but not if you have to sit in queue
[0:47:15] <cokeandasmile> Paige and I sneezed at the same time
[0:47:18] <alrobot2014> is the baby yelling or am i just hearing thing
[0:47:21] <cokeandasmile> witchcraft

[0:47:40] <tragicjohnson84> Feed him pls
[0:47:41] <%tyler274> so if you die you're going to have to reset
[0:47:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> he scream
[0:47:42] <%shurtal> if you don't know the game, you'll just do the x x x and the y y y
[0:47:44] <Ner234> He roar
[0:47:44] <%Faustgesicht> loud screm
[0:47:49] <+tigerfang86> S C R E M
[0:47:49] <TheHotStuven> How many Viera Dancers are dancing afk in town yet? Kappa
[0:48:08] <%ryome> Not enough
[0:48:11] <%tyler274> i look forward to trusts being backported
[0:48:22] <BunnyEmperor> I've used the trust system for every first dungeon run so far and it works perfectly, if you pick the right team
[0:48:26] <tragicjohnson84> I have a tort, and all it wants to do is eat. I had to put it on a diet
[0:48:45] <medril07> all these cars
[0:48:51] <Ner234> That car is ridiculous LUL

[0:49:02] <medril07> aw fat tortoise
[0:49:04] <+tigerfang86> C H O N K
[0:49:10] <+Xalgar> I'm always afraid when they add QoL stuff for Solo only players because eventually, they want it to become more and more robust and suddenly, a ton of people are just soloing dungeons in your multiplayer rpg
[0:49:10] <BunnyEmperor> Blastoise
[0:49:11] <Sol_Install> Is he name Moto Moto?
[0:49:18] <%Bigbossman91> @EastwindGuru Crossover event item

[0:50:07] <dredshift> That looks dumb as shit and I love it
[0:50:07] <+EastwindGuru> lmao thank you for that
[0:50:11] <Daxalog> Is that a batman mod?
[0:50:13] <%dreamfillah> MAOOW
[0:50:15] <+Estuko> I wish it had collision with other players so Pat could just scoop up all the wandering players with the wings LUL
[0:50:16] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[0:50:21] <medril07> I only got the normal edition of 15
[0:50:21] <Ner234> Feed Elmo
[0:50:21] <%Maids4lyfe> that's just the car from 15
[0:50:22] <+Artemis_Scowl> Elmo doing the big screm

[0:50:37] <%ElenaManetta> we've given you 18 dollars
[0:50:37] <mayorrev> :(
[0:50:38] <medril07> without all the extras and dlc
[0:50:39] <%ElenaManetta> over the course of many years
[0:50:40] <%Maids4lyfe> apatGib
[0:50:44] <+meatgeneral69> its faster than normal mouints
[0:50:50] <%weissguard> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo Big SCREMS apatPorgmo apatPorgmo

[0:50:54] <KatabolicRage> it's like 30usd or something
[0:50:55] <snowmanse> Fenrir SDS
[0:50:58] <%Faustgesicht> Fenris
[0:51:01] <mayorrev> pat you get donations like every 5 minutes u egg
[0:51:03] <%MyDarkStorm> ITS $30
[0:51:03] <%NobleJedi> apatGib
[0:51:03] <+Anonymasque> The more is see of XIV the more I realize the plan is just make a Virtual Theme Park of all Final Fanstasy shit people love.
[0:51:04] <+EastwindGuru> Do all the mounts cost $ or can some be earned in game?
[0:51:05] <+CountNebula> Yeah, that's money Pat could be spending on a different online game for different hats.
[0:51:10] <%ElenaManetta> CRAZY
[0:51:13] <tragicjohnson84> What does Elmo like more? Attention or food?
[0:51:15] <mayorrev> aw
[0:51:16] <Saunt> has build in land speed
[0:51:22] <Cpt_phantom> So much money for a mount
[0:51:27] <%ElenaManetta> you've gotten 30 dollars before because you talked about shit in your pants
[0:51:30] <%ElenaManetta> CRAZY he says
[0:51:30] <KatabolicRage> except I got it for cheap cos the dollar is WEAK and exchange rates work in my favour
[0:51:39] <+Masutasodo> @EastwindGuru majority of mounts in-game, some on the shop for $
[0:51:43] <BunnyEmperor> @EastwindGuru the most mounts are acquired in game and there are only few in the store
[0:51:46] <medril07> that's the answer?
[0:51:49] <%NWR_James> I'd only pay $30 for a mount if it would annoy everyone around me. Like, make it play music like an ice cream truck and shoot off fireworks as I drive
[0:51:52] <jackythefrost> @EastwindGuru Most of them are earned ingame but some special ones like Clouds fenrir you gotta pay$ for
[0:51:58] <devaitto> Hello
[0:52:00] <+Xalgar> @Anonymasque And they actually give enough of a shit to write lore about it to make it fit, except the mounts and glamour stuff LUL
[0:52:01] <+EastwindGuru> Nice. thanks for answering folks
[0:52:05] <medril07> Hey Paige!
[0:52:10] <devaitto> Chat/Angri, can i ask which one are the most populated servers?
[0:52:18] <%Zepik> 30 bucks but full mount speed by default
[0:52:43] <BunnyEmperor> @devaitto google ff14 census
[0:52:47] <+meatgeneral69> im glad fat evil is back in force
[0:52:55] <devaitto> Okey
[0:53:08] <+Anonymasque> @Xalgar And that makes me super confused about how Square Enix even works.
[0:53:08] <jackythefrost> Biggest server is Balmung
[0:53:13] <+Movemeister> Hey peeps, just got here. Miss anything good?

[0:53:55] <dredshift> Is a shot gonna jump out of your asshole
[0:54:01] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat Do you think adding flying in 14 was a good idea now that we're 2 expansions in?
[0:54:27] <%boomboxvillain> so I'm playing through ff12 for the first time. Is foebreaker good?
[0:55:06] <%Yadogari> His IQ is too high to speak normally
[0:55:18] <%kurensik> Hello
[0:55:23] <%Guardiansaiyan> @boomboxvillain foebreaker helps in combo plays...solo not as much
[0:55:25] <+Xalgar> You would think someone would eventually slap him and tell him to talk like a normal human LUL
[0:55:28] <%Valdorick> eh-he he… taint

[1:02:30] <KiDBrooKlynHD> is it 16x the size of Fallout 4?
[1:02:35] <%ElenaManetta> Sometimes there are police sirens that go on for so long, I get it, there's crimes, but shut up
[1:02:36] <alrobot2014> is that an overgrown tomato?
[1:02:48] <%ElenaManetta> i'm trying to listen to STREAMS
[1:02:48] <+Estuko> @KiDBrooKlynHD if you see that mountain, you can climb it.
[1:03:07] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> that thing reminds me of the tomtato boys in legend of mana
[1:03:10] <BunnyEmperor> Getting flying unlocked in this area took really long

[1:03:14] <%ArcanumMBD> You've been playing this expac for 5 levels and just noticed that??

[1:03:56] <BunnyEmperor> @doc_ock_rokc Pegasus whistle?
[1:03:59] <Ozmodyas> Atrociraptor is such a good name for a fantasy dinosaur enemy
[1:04:01] <+Fynale> btw yshtola is confirmed blind now

[1:11:42] <@Squishy3> it keeps their properties of when they were teleported
[1:11:42] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> ^^
[1:11:42] <+TheImmortal70> She was literally INSIDE the lifestream
[1:11:43] <%ArcanumMBD> The soul remembers the scars of the body
[1:11:47] <+TheImmortal70> So yea, she's magically fucked up
[1:11:48] <%Zepik> thancred explained it back at urianger's house, he said all his body's ailments came with him
[1:11:50] <AdmiralButtloaf> she has sever mako poisoning
[1:11:52] <KatabolicRage> she went blind from sitting in the lifestream too much, thancred became unable to use magic from the same thing
[1:11:52] <%Aeogard> thancred's a better tank than pat omegaLUL
[1:11:53] <dredshift> It'd be way better if she just kept her eyes closed cause she thought she was still blind
[1:11:54] <AdmiralButtloaf> severe
[1:11:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yaay more Shadowmans
[1:12:02] <TioXyco> how is she magically blind if she sees via aether/ether
[1:12:03] <%Doruben> he lied
[1:12:13] <KatabolicRage> seeing via aether is.. not ideal
[1:12:20] <+Fynale> i do have to agree with paige pat does look better with a crew cut
[1:12:20] <%mh9s> the most handsome egg in all the land
[1:12:22] <+TheImmortal70> Seeing via aether kills you
[1:12:22] <KatabolicRage> it's implied to not be great for your health
[1:12:24] <FutaSnek> Pat's haircut makes him look younger
[1:12:29] <+Fynale> his beard does look good on him
[1:12:36] <%Valdorick> Camera manipulation
[1:12:36] <Sol_Install> LUL
[1:12:40] <%ElenaManetta> Nothing on this channel is real, they're just very convincing actors
[1:12:40] <%Fatmanjoggin> All camera angles
[1:12:41] <dredshift> It's all depth of field manipulation
[1:12:44] <Retinolgaming> PogChamp
[1:12:45] <seycheles> disembodied big paige!
[1:12:51] <FutaSnek> Pat actually 7 ft tall
[1:12:53] <+tigerfang86> pat are you using echolocation
[1:12:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Elmo is actually a guy in a suit
[1:12:54] <%ElenaManetta> Elmo is actually a puppet that Pat and Paige pull the string where you can't see it
[1:12:56] <+Movemeister> Got 'em PogChamp
[1:12:59] <+TheImmortal70> There's a reason the camera isn't facing the couch directly
[1:13:10] <SatsumaVO> @AngriestPat Kinda sounds like Witcher music
[1:13:12] <alrobot2014> wait a minute, how will you see in this place when you dispel the light?
[1:13:24] <%blankwaffle> yo it does sound like the witcher music
[1:13:26] <Daxalog> No. Pat and Paige are the puppets and the cat is controlling them.
[1:13:30] <$Afterman_> im diggin the music of the xpac so far! and i usually dont give much of a shit lol
[1:13:31] <mayorrev> Elmo is actually a little person in a fursuit
[1:13:37] <+TheImmortal70> Apparently it got guest composed by the witcher composer
[1:13:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> We've all got an Elmo controlling us!
[1:13:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> The real reason they don't show feet is because they use their toes to operate Elmo. Has nothing to do with prevent gross foot beat offs
[1:13:51] <FutaSnek> @blankwaffle Funny you say that Im playing Witcher 3 rn LUL
[1:14:02] <+SickBangerzM9> Pat did you find nargacuga in the beta?
[1:14:13] <+Fynale> yeah raktiki is supposed to be the twelveswood
[1:14:14] <+Estuko> FeelsBirthdayMan knowing your existence was granted just to make THE BABY happy
[1:14:29] <seycheles> thank you pat for not being afraid to show legit mmo action
[1:14:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat, paige and elmo don't exist. You are in a coma, we are trying to wake you. Wake up.

[1:16:31] <Ozmodyas> Shorn from the world of the blazing sun, bound to the dark for the light he shuns
[1:16:39] <BappoSama> Good afternoon Pat. How goes Shadowbringers?
[1:16:43] <mayorrev> sick
[1:16:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> That implies Paige stops shitposting
[1:16:53] <FutaSnek> Paige exists in a perpetual state of shitposting
[1:16:57] <+SickBangerzM9> paige shitposts in her sleep
[1:17:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Shitposting is what gives Paige her power
[1:17:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige is a living shitpost

[1:17:25] <%Zepik> a tribe of "step on me" warriors

[1:46:25] <floatRand> He loves his daddy.
[1:46:25] <%i6bitfrost> 4.0 might be garbo though
[1:46:30] <$OmegaWeltall> Congratulations Shinji
[1:46:31] <%Dr00_PhD> i mean people have been telling me about it for years and i wanted to know why
[1:46:35] <FutaSnek> Its super not LUL

[1:46:42] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @FutaSnek Gimmie yer sem-- er I mean Serum
[1:46:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm depressed enough in real life. I don't need to watch a time capsule of a man's worst moments to add onto it
[1:47:01] <+tigerfang86> it MADE THOSE
[1:47:02] <%NobleJedi> LUL
[1:47:03] <+Sp3ctre48> Yeah cause it's super old LUL
[1:47:03] <+tigerfang86> WTF
[1:47:03] <FutaSnek> @happyfunt1me It literally parody's and makes fun of them more then it features them
[1:47:05] <+troyfitzg> LUL
[1:47:05] <happyfunt1me> No it didn't, anime is so much older than you think.
[1:47:05] <%Typhaeon> LuL

[1:47:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat it more is deconstructing those tropes...but yeah
[1:47:18] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[1:47:18] <%Dr00_PhD> that's the worst part about going back in time
[1:47:23] <+RocketBarrel> I watched Death = True2 was like isn't this just a retelling of the original anime?
[1:47:27] <FutaSnek> LOOK AT THIS DOOD
[1:47:31] <Sol_Install> But wouldn't Dororo and Astro boy be the real inventors?
[1:47:31] <%Toast_Master_General> Pat you've probably been asked this a lot by now but are having a good time playing the new expansion?
[1:47:33] <seycheles> anime was invented by australia confirmed
[1:47:34] <+spades3> LUL you just have bad taste
[1:47:35] <%Typhaeon> Stick to Lucky Star, kid Kappa
[1:47:45] <%budyd> I'll have you know animo is FAR older than EVEN YOU realize.
[1:47:46] <dredshift> Anime was a mistake
[1:47:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> But, like, Eva's OP is some of the coolest shit, so there's that.
[1:47:52] <%BlueMoonBlues> this guy is hard b8ing

[1:48:03] <%Toast_Master_General> Okay good, happy to hear
[1:48:05] <%budyd> It was invented by Darth Plagus the Wise.
[1:48:08] <happyfunt1me> It's really not that old compared to like Gatchaman / G-Force and it didn't just jump into cliche garbage.
[1:48:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Anime starts in the 1940s
[1:48:17] <%i6bitfrost> so can i be squall with gunzerker? @AngriestPat
[1:48:19] <%VanaSkiller> he wouldn't come back
[1:48:20] <+Sp3ctre48> You're wrong for enjoying something Pat SwiftRage
[1:48:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Ancient egyptians invented anime
[1:48:23] <happyfunt1me> Lupin is OLD.
[1:48:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> @doc_ock_rokc Just like the cartoons
[1:48:30] <happyfunt1me> Eva is just dumb.
[1:48:32] <+spades3> yeah stick with your shit moe anime kid
[1:48:32] <FutaSnek> Lupin is og
[1:48:36] <NotSoAccurateNo1> god invented anime, anime created the world
[1:48:37] <%TysonPG> idk i loved caveman anime
[1:48:38] <Ipsenscastle> Anime was invented by King Henry VIII between composing Greensleeves and inventing Tennis
[1:48:43] <vinceshamwowslap> Pat did you get a hair cut
[1:48:45] <%abakkus> cavemanime?
[1:48:46] <+RocketBarrel> Lupin is like from the 70s right?
[1:48:49] <%i6bitfrost> then he invented anime church lol
[1:48:50] <+Zxtole> "Thing is bad because I don't like it"

[1:49:14] <+tigerfang86> wow now I'm so much more involved
[1:49:17] <+captain_elsewhere> i think he popularised tennis
[1:49:22] <%NWR_James> tennis was the first anime
[1:49:22] <+tigerfang86> informed
[1:49:23] <%abakkus> im learning so much today

[1:49:42] <alrobot2014> didn't henry the 8th also invent divorce because he couldn't get a good son out of all his wife then ended up with a bunch of wives
[1:49:43] <FutaSnek> People just don't like EVA cause it makes them think about their life LUL
[1:49:44] <happyfunt1me> See, Anime is even older really because it's just mangas which are basiclly like a 1800s invention.
[1:49:47] <%budyd> He invented the Scots
[1:49:51] <%Tearonex> hahahahahaha
[1:49:52] <%budyd> no

[2:10:02] <Daxalog> Works out while he stares at the stars
[2:10:03] <floatRand> He is AST, but main stat replaced with STR
[2:10:16] <+BubbaRands> You saying a can't read and make G A I N S?
[2:10:26] <suikudo> The truth of the world is heavy gotta be swole
[2:10:29] <%Aeogard> @spooksy absolutely. tons of people playing, lots of hype, and the old content still gets run a lot consistently even at endgame so you dont have awful queues
[2:10:34] <NotSoAccurateNo1> do you think he's still paying off his college loans?
[2:10:41] <%Giggalith> He must needs get swole
[2:10:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> Elmo got big bag

[2:12:00] <alrobot2014> that sounds like some kinda kink
[2:12:00] <dekkitout> He's 'eccentric'
[2:12:01] <+WaywardSera> You got yourself a kinky ass kitty Pat
[2:12:02] <%Toast_Master_General> Don't kink shame Elmo
[2:12:03] <+ImTrin> kinky kitty
[2:12:09] <+BubbaRands> Elmo is slightly masochistic TIL
[2:12:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> In Pillars, you can be a Wizard and literally smack bitches with your book
[2:12:12] <%ElenaManetta> You say your cat is weird but I think your cat is just a cat
[2:12:14] <%THATGUY_789> BDSM Elmo
[2:12:14] <%miguelrod777> he knows his kink
[2:12:17] <NotSoAccurateNo1> he just wants to you get his eye boogers
[2:12:30] <%Toast_Master_General> He's just doing his best
[2:12:37] <%ac1dtr1px> ac1dtr1px subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:12:43] <keiji_maede> That song there is one of the best!
[2:12:44] <%TysonPG> BDSElmo
[2:12:45] <alrobot2014> is he weird by cat standards?
[2:13:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's true
[2:13:11] <Adaruan> YES
[2:13:22] <Koosahmii> Maybe it reminds him of when he used to nursed and groomed by his mom? Maybe she was a bit rough?
[2:13:26] <Ipsenscastle> He is glowing with prayer energy
[2:13:37] <+BubbaRands> Bring him to a Con so he can SwiftRage
[2:13:46] <%abakkus> his fur is so big because its full of our love
[2:13:52] <%THATGUY_789> he's was pulled from the dumpster before a rat could train him to be a ninja.
[2:14:09] <$valriot> LA HEE
[2:14:39] <%TysonPG> is that why he eats it so he ca be filled with love? @abakkus
[2:14:50] <%abakkus> correct
[2:15:02] <%TysonPG> dang
[2:15:14] <%Yadogari> The bees are a predator of spiders?
[2:15:20] <%THATGUY_789> he loves to eat his own love
[2:15:22] <dekkitout> Da beeeez
[2:15:22] <suikudo> The bane of Paige
[2:15:28] <Ipsenscastle> Hence the popular phrase: like a bee amongst the spiders
[2:15:40] <%Dr00_PhD> smoke trees not bees
[2:15:44] <count_bob> "Then we'll put the bees in a sandwich."
[2:15:44] <%ElenaManetta> I'm gonna go ahead and mark this box "B" so we all know it's filled with bees
[2:15:50] <%THATGUY_789> this sounds like a 10yr olds plan
[2:15:51] <dekkitout> Wait- the BEEs get the spiders? You sure those are bees and not HAWK WASPS
[2:15:51] <%Gogogolem> its 420 time for smoke
[2:15:55] <count_bob> "To torture some random girl.
[2:16:04] <%Kilagn> SourPls
[2:16:14] <MSN04_Sazabi> @Koosahmii Let's not go all Freud on poor Elmo. Also his mom left him in a dumpster.
[2:16:28] <%Lapinelis> I am, right now
[2:16:30] <%THATGUY_789> a Beenut Butter sandwich
[2:16:30] <Koosahmii> Random dancing cactus is random
[2:16:42] <%miguelrod777> ye
[2:16:46] <%Gogogolem> I finshed the maw earlier
[2:16:47] <%Mekhet09> Mine's at 76.
[2:16:50] <%THATGUY_789> I just reached 60
[2:16:52] <Arweynn> I've never touched the game or watched it before these last few streams.
[2:17:02] <%ArcanumMBD> is it Dancer now?
[2:17:31] <%Typhaeon> Holy shit
[2:17:42] <+WaywardSera> Number go UP
[2:17:51] <dekkitout> Muy gigante numero
[2:18:11] <ASleepySnek> yea dancer gets a 1000 potency at lvl 15 which is bonkers
[2:18:12] <%ArcanumMBD> Yeah dancer's technical step can hit 1500 potency, it's insane
[2:18:44] <+vizzay> I'm at 77 and haven't noticed that big numbers from Scholar
[2:18:46] <%mor_materia_company> @AngriestPat I nailed a 70k Sam finisher earlier, and that was before I got the spell that lets be double cast it at increased potency.
[2:19:32] <+skyheys> Anyone told @AngriestPat that, if he cares about character writing stuff, he needs to do Trust dungeon runs before finishing the MSQ? It morphs into a new form of grind once you beat the expansion.
[2:19:35] <NotSoAccurateNo1> you ever pull the Fenrir mount out of golden saucer?
[2:19:44] <$Afterman_> fuuuck i am hyped to get paid, lmao. Finishing up some SB quests, but I can't wait to play this.
[2:19:46] <%ArcanumMBD> The big difference is Living Shadow is mixing single target with AoE abilities most likely. While Technical Finish is a 1500 potency AOE
[2:19:55] <%Typhaeon> So that means I should give Left Eye to it
[2:20:00] <FutaSnek> Crazy Talk is finally combat ready Pogchamp
[2:20:02] <%Valdorick> That could be good or bad... or at least, that seems like it'll sperate good from... not so good... Dark Knights.
[2:20:07] <FutaSnek> PogChamp
[2:20:48] <Ipsenscastle> Yeah, slice that cloud of bees up
[2:20:54] <%THATGUY_789> I might hit LVL cap before I get ShB. hit 60 and just starting HW
[2:20:55] <Ipsenscastle> with a greatsword
[2:21:02] <%NobleJedi> not the BEES
[2:21:15] <%Valdorick> Its a Dark Infused greatsword, it like... irradiates them, or something.
[2:21:20] <$OmegaWeltall> yea i only messed around with DRK for a little bit at 70 this expansion but its fuckin dope
[2:21:27] <+WaywardSera> smash them with the flat of your sword
[2:21:28] <$OmegaWeltall> trying to lv BLM atm
[2:21:31] <+pyrojack6> stop the stinging!
[2:21:33] <%Toast_Master_General> Just smack them with the broad side
[2:21:34] <+Gruntini> "I am very accurate with my bees."
[2:21:46] <%THATGUY_789> is that your move in bed Pat lol
[2:21:50] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan for honor just bumming me out now
[2:21:58] <%THATGUY_789> the dark missionary
[2:22:00] <%miguelrod777> NOT THE BEES
[2:22:41] <Cowctus> everyone hyped for shadowbringers. I'm just here fishing
[2:22:44] <%THATGUY_789> I guess it's just sex with the lights off
[2:22:49] <Adaruan> you have to smoke out the bees before you can enter the femcave
[2:22:49] <Ipsenscastle> Lifehack: throw bees at spiders
[2:22:52] <+Woronov> @AngriestPat so finished the MSQ and it appears the Exarch is indeed Tataru standing on Pipins shoulders with a coat
[2:22:53] <+Estuko> As a peacekeeper I'm squishy and mid combat a lot of my "allies" just shove me out of the way with their heavier lads and steal the executions/kills.
[2:23:26] <%Yadogari> What the hell Woronov DansGame
[2:23:29] <suikudo> Actually scared me
[2:23:29] <Sol_Install> WOW
[2:23:32] <suikudo> Please dont do that
[2:23:33] <Quizzeh_> LUL
[2:23:34] <Daxalog> Ban HE
[2:23:35] <%Valdorick> Bees vs Spiders seems like a bad matchup.
[2:23:35] <%Unlimited_> wow

[2:23:36] <$OmegaWeltall> the fuck man! DansGame
[2:23:38] <dekkitout> R-really? That sounds hilarious
[2:23:39] <%Unlimited_> spoilers woronov

[2:23:44] <+Gruntini> LUL
[2:23:45] <%crazyspartan214> WTF MAN!!!!!
[2:23:50] <+BubbaRands> Best character
[2:23:50] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you might as well not play the game
[2:23:50] <$OmegaWeltall> guess i'll just u ninstall now thanks asshole :P
[2:23:51] <yourliteraldog> Pat your new hair makes you look like the nerdiest skin head
[2:23:51] <%ArcanumMBD> For real, the way you reacted to that Pat made my heart sink as I jerked my head away from chat
[2:23:52] <+VashyronM> unsub
[2:23:53] <%THATGUY_789> classic joke
[2:23:54] <%miguelrod777> proves tataru is the best scion
[2:24:02] <+Movemeister> Love me some Bojack
[2:24:07] <suikudo> That was really genuinly sounding
[2:24:27] <%NobleJedi> Kappa
[2:24:29] <alrobot2014> then what does that mean for pathological liars?
[2:24:31] <%Valdorick> But that's not acting or lying Kappa
[2:24:36] <+BubbaRands> It wasn't a joke, tho Kappa
[2:24:38] <dredshift> Good lying is subtle, good acting isn't
[2:24:40] <dekkitout> Okay, now he's NOT lying
[2:24:53] <%THATGUY_789> isn't AoT final ep on today
[2:24:55] <+Gruntini> @AngriestPat hey pat, i read an article saying that 14 is only good if you got in to the game 6 years ago, what do you think about that?
[2:24:57] <Calek> more like PATological liars
[2:25:06] <Ipsenscastle> LIAM
[2:25:07] <%Valdorick> They heard the phrase "the world Is a stage" and were like "THAT SHIT IS MY CREED NOW!"
[2:25:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pat-hological liars
[2:25:13] <Adaruan> pathological liars can't help but to lie. it's not really that they are shit
[2:25:16] <+TONYOO101> more like mathological liars, cause their shit dont add up
[2:25:26] <Adaruan> that's the term pathological. it is illness-like
[2:25:30] <%THATGUY_789> I work with someone like that
[2:25:39] <%Faustgesicht> i currently work with one. he sucks
[2:26:08] <graemecrackers1> how can he jump with all that armour xD
[2:26:14] <Daxalog> I feel bad for people like that. Means they got nothing going on and they arent aware of how to fix it.

[2:26:52] <Daxalog> Their brain is literally telling them to create new realities cause theirs sucks.
[2:26:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> I kind of feel bad for folks like that. Is there any way you can get therapy for it, or smthn?
[2:26:57] <NotSoAccurateNo1> these stories are why I am here

[3:30:06] <%VioletHeart> Elves live about 150 years in FF14.
[3:30:12] <Ipsenscastle> @stormingryocan220 do you remember Pokemon Conquest? That was a weird one
[3:30:24] <Belutima> so these bunnies get about 450 year old
[3:30:26] <%VioletHeart> But hyur live for 120 so everyone lives a lil longer than IRL.
[3:30:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, they're RABBITS, Pat.
[3:30:43] <dredshift> Pat, are you gonna try out the mobile FFT game coming out?

[3:32:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> I bet this bunny tribe functions like the Amazons, rounding up fertile young males to mate and continue their lineage
[3:32:45] <devaitto> I just started playing FFXIV and i just hitted lvl 10, i wanna rush to 50 to make me a Samurai
[3:32:49] <Belutima> you dont say.
[3:32:50] <devaitto> Which class would be the fastest to lvl up?
[3:32:58] <%demegodz> @GarbageQueenEllie Death by snu snu
[3:33:00] <+Estuko> @GarbageQueenEllie Yes.
[3:33:06] <%wolfofsound> @GarbageQueenEllie god I wish that were me
[3:33:08] <stormingryocan220> can you pet the bunnies thou?

[3:33:18] <$valriot> Paige LUL
[3:33:19] <jackythefrost> @devaitto They all level at the same rate from MSQ
[3:33:26] <%weissguard> It is I who NUTS to that.
[3:33:27] <BunnyEmperor> No idea for DRK
[3:33:31] <floatRand> Does it have higher damage?
[3:33:31] <%Kain5707> i think so
[3:33:32] <%Faustgesicht> @devaitto WHM, you instaque for danugeons
[3:33:38] <+donpatrondx> it's not
[3:33:42] <%crazyspartan214> no bunny men, just women!
[3:33:43] <%Suchawus> I think the one in the box is but the store-bought one isnt
[3:33:49] <+donpatrondx> it's like 3 more hp
[3:33:52] <floatRand> Marginally so
[3:33:58] <devaitto> @Faustgesicht Can i lvl up to 10 from 50 only with dungeons?
[3:34:09] <%Valdorick> Technically Stronger... the best kind of Stronger!
[3:34:11] <floatRand> Man Baelsar is so hammy
[3:34:14] <floatRand> It never gets unfunny
[3:34:19] <BunnyEmperor> I cheated my iLvl up for trials and kept some of my old gear cause of the stats
[3:34:20] <floatRand> ...I wish he was still as hammy
[3:34:59] <jackythefrost> You need to do the main story anyway and leveling your first class takes a WHILE dude
[3:35:32] <devaitto> mmmm
[3:35:45] <devaitto> Define a while.
[3:35:50] <devaitto> How much it will take me to 50
[3:36:13] <Arweynn> which game?
[3:36:21] <+Deaderhand> AHHH bunny gorls jundLove
[3:36:43] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Viera -u-
[3:36:44] <jackythefrost> Depends on how much time you are willing to put into the game
[3:36:50] <%wolfofsound> Imagine getting an ear job from a bunny girl Kreygasm
[3:36:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> ITs ELMO
[3:37:00] <+BubbaRands> Fat cat PogChamp
[3:37:05] <Sol_Install> an Elmo!
[3:37:07] <%rdark_ksu> are all the bunnies like 8 ft tall or just some of em?
[3:37:11] <spankadelic_> corpulent cat
[3:37:15] <Zombrocom> Chats being weird DansGame
[3:37:16] <floatRand> Gonna be honest, there is a hump between ARR and HW, so there is long journey. Try to enjoy it
[3:37:16] <+Estuko> I want to be married by a 6ft+ viera girl as a house wife.
[3:37:18] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @wolfofsound Not now, I'm watching on mobile
[3:37:26] <tactician0> @devaitto it took me about a week when first started playing to get to 50
[3:37:35] <skullnaught> i saw ear job and i wish i jadn't
[3:37:39] <%wolfofsound> @GreyFoxHoundDD nobody will have to know
[3:37:39] <stormingryocan220> the el elmo mobile
[3:37:40] <%snow_bush> A race built for FUCk
[3:37:50] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @wolfofsound I'm on a bus
[3:37:51] <+killer_squid1990> the max size in the character creation is 192cm or like 6ft 2 inches
[3:37:55] <%wolfofsound> Listen they can move their ears really well
[3:38:04] <+BubbaRands> Amazon Bunny Girls have started an awakening within me Kreygasm
[3:38:05] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat bad movie made popular by MST3K
[3:38:05] <+Movemeister> Those bunnies got some good GAMS
[3:38:06] <%Typhaeon> The card/aventure game series?
[3:38:06] <+Estuko> HAnd of Fate is an attack move used by Angemon from Digimon
[3:38:07] <alrobot2014> oh that's what you meant by earjob
[3:38:09] <%mastertwin2> Hand of Fate is rad
[3:38:09] <%BlueMoonBlues> Manos the Hand of Fate/stay Night
[3:38:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> ...head
[3:38:22] <%wolfofsound> EARS
[3:38:28] <%VantomPayne> its a card game with arkham combat
[3:38:32] <floatRand> I am pretty sure they keep all bunnyboys locked up in basement, fed with indiscernible slurry and kept zealously safe.
[3:38:36] <%Valdorick> Hand of Fate is... uh... hard to explain... yes... what Vantom said
[3:38:37] <%titans_ace_jerid> Head height and max height as two different stats.
[3:38:38] <+vizzay> Head, cause ear height is a separate slider
[3:38:41] <+vizzay> It's that simple
[3:38:43] <stormingryocan220> bet all these bunnie
[3:38:54] <+Estuko> @floatRand they're probably super cute.
[3:39:00] <+BubbaRands> If it's part of your flesh it's part of your height
[3:39:13] <%wolfofsound> @BubbaRands This guy gets it
[3:39:16] <BunnyEmperor> It really is
[3:39:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yes
[3:39:17] <stormingryocan220> I Bet all these bunnie girls have crazy casual orgies
[3:39:19] <Aristotlay> Paige-io Kart
[3:39:21] <katocrimson> lol
[3:39:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yea, she cool
[3:39:26] <spankadelic_> its got the ears
[3:39:27] <BunnyEmperor> LULW
[3:39:29] <Belutima> YUP, when I saw it for the first time yesterday, I thought of the same thing
[3:39:30] <$OmegaWeltall> do it got dem cans?
[3:39:30] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat I bet her big feet step really well Kappa
[3:39:31] <missingangle> not enough of the crazy, tho
[3:39:32] <%rdark_ksu> has mole
[3:39:33] <corrosivePaladin> She needs the hugebitch
[3:39:36] <$Quigsies> Na Pat, she's an archer, and we all know that Paige can't see LUL
[3:39:38] <%mastertwin2> JUST like pat
[3:39:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> I thought Paige would be a lalafell
[3:39:43] <KatabolicRage> well unless it's a special non giraffe elezen
[3:39:45] <%Valdorick> JUST like pat, even the tiny penic
[3:39:47] <%Roundelay11> but you're not a lala?
[3:39:52] <Zombrocom> So... is this an all female race or something?
[3:39:54] <BunnyEmperor> But does she have lupus tho
[3:39:58] <Belutima> @Quigsies it fits because they couldnt hit shit in the last cutscene
[3:39:59] <%Valdorick> It is
[3:40:07] <%Scarnehu> he's an optimized pat
[3:40:12] <stormingryocan220> Bunnie Paige hype
[3:40:13] <%Valdorick> To counter balance the all male race added in Stormblood
[3:40:13] <+Estuko> @Zombrocom YEah
[3:40:14] <$Quigsies> @Belutima True enough!
[3:40:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Roundelay11 In real life Pat is a lala but Paige would be a lala in ff14
[3:40:24] <jackythefrost> Male Viera do exist but they have never been seen before in any FF game
[3:40:34] <Zombrocom> So how do they not die out. Do they split like amoeba?
[3:40:36] <%Valdorick> See the moles on Viera?
[3:40:39] <spankadelic_> they wearing high heels?!
[3:40:42] <%Valdorick> That's their men. They're like Angler Fish
[3:40:47] <%wolfofsound> They are like lamia they need men
[3:41:01] <floatRand> Hit lv80 now!
[3:41:04] <Thalchampz> Viera go out of their homes to mate with other races
[3:41:09] <%Valdorick> Big Steppy
[3:41:13] <+Estuko> Steppy on Esty
[3:41:16] <%VanaSkiller> atpGasm
[3:41:17] <Zombrocom> Of course they do
[3:41:17] <+rei0> but they live on a forest
[3:41:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> They need voes
[3:41:20] <%rdark_ksu> Just give them stilts and really lean into it
[3:41:27] <Belutima> there is a foot stomp emote..... to simulate bunny women stepping on your dick doodLewd
[3:41:30] <+Amperture> Pwease no steppy
[3:41:34] <stormingryocan220> Tactical High heels made to step on the enemies
[3:42:01] <%wolfofsound> I'll take an EJ over stepping frankly
[3:42:04] <%rdark_ksu> Bunny society runs on a height based hierarchy. Tallest at the top and the not so tall at the bottom
[3:42:04] <%Scarnehu> apatWrong
[3:42:11] <KatabolicRage> it's a reskin of the old high mythrite set from HW
[3:42:14] <floatRand> Now I receive my stand「Automaton Queen」
[3:42:18] <+PenmanLupine> not every big glowing sword is a Dark Souls
[3:42:19] <KatabolicRage> though theres a melee dps version of that too now

[3:43:59] <Aristotlay> Tarkus, imprisoning me
[3:44:00] <$Afterman_> looks fuckin great
[3:44:04] <Sol_Install> can you dye the sword?
[3:44:05] <%Lapinelis> A lot of the armours are fashionable
[3:44:08] <BunnyEmperor> Pat is a regal roe
[3:44:12] <%Lapinelis> from the new expansion
[3:44:14] <KatabolicRage> thats a re-use of the HW high mythrite set
[3:44:14] <alrobot2014> do you like gold with your purple
[3:44:16] <%Valdorick> Purple is a good color to like - strong and royal.
[3:44:16] <NotSoAccurateNo1> fashion fantasy
[3:44:19] <Aristotlay> Dye the redbull
[3:44:22] <$Afterman_> purple is the color of royalty
[3:44:24] <%trillmagical> I knew that

[3:44:33] <Belutima> J WONGGGG
[3:44:38] <Zombrocom> That sword is a damn flag
[3:44:40] <stormingryocan220> Pat character looks like a Berserk villian

[3:44:46] <%VanaSkiller> Lord of Laming it out
[3:44:48] <Sol_Install> very lame
[3:44:51] <$Quigsies> Dress em in white
[3:45:01] <Ipsenscastle> Marquis of lame
[3:45:03] <Zombrocom> Lame is a fighting game term for playing zoning/defensive
[3:45:10] <+BubbaRands> It's the ears
[3:45:13] <ashe_strachan> But what about..Bunny shotas?
[3:45:13] <+Zxtole> Monster girls are cute
[3:45:14] <alrobot2014> and the tails
[3:45:18] <%wolfofsound> Yup ears can confirm
[3:45:19] <Thalchampz> eey

[3:45:26] <Calek> legs
[3:45:27] <Sol_Install> Eey~
[3:45:32] <Belutima> Jump cut to J WONG zoning out the kid in MK X LUL
[3:45:32] <+Estuko> @Calek YUH
[3:45:33] <%Valdorick> Because shy lame neets can whisper that they love them, and their fucked up animal ears will hear them anyway!
[3:45:35] <%wolfofsound> I honestly blame lola bunny
[3:45:43] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[3:45:53] <missingangle> It's so people can deny that they're furries by saying that "they still look human. They just got ears and tails, man."
[3:45:55] <%RittiFruity> That sad feeling when monk's Bootshine hit harder and more consistent than Tornado kick
[3:45:55] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat Ear Jobs pat
[3:46:00] <BunnyEmperor> LUL
[3:46:03] <skullnaught> what do you mean?
[3:46:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Did you ever want to pet your cat's ears

[3:46:16] <Sol_Install> Paige what?
[3:46:16] <+BubbaRands> If it doesn't explain it then you don't get it yet.
[3:46:22] <dekkitout> Pat is grandiloquent like that
[3:46:27] <skullnaught> animal ears on cute girls is cute
[3:46:28] <missingangle> "You keep using that word. I don't think you know what it means."
[3:46:29] <$Afterman_> this sounds like an ex of mine lol
[3:46:30] <Sol_Install> The ears mean nothing
[3:46:31] <%theturtlebar> Pat, that's not what Reductive means
[3:46:35] <%AngriestAngryArtist> oh here we go
[3:46:39] <Ipsenscastle> Pat is sesquipedalian
[3:46:41] <%titans_ace_jerid> The ears though.
[3:46:41] <%crazyspartan214> Ears are cute pat!
[3:46:42] <jackythefrost> ITS CUTE
[3:46:44] <%Roundelay11> It's more exotic than vanilla humans
[3:46:44] <alrobot2014> aesthetically pleasing
[3:46:45] <+TheImmortal70> Rabbits FUCK
[3:46:46] <+Gruntini> What are you Pat, a cop?
[3:46:47] <+BubbaRands> The ears mean E V E R Y T H I N G
[3:46:48] <corrosivePaladin> Because theyre closet furries and wont accept it
[3:46:49] <Zombrocom> Ears are dumb
[3:46:49] <+Estuko> the legs and ears, and Viera kick it up with the hairstyle and body type
[3:46:49] <NotSoAccurateNo1> ears are fucking gross
[3:46:51] <Sol_Install> Do people have Ear Fetishs?
[3:46:52] <stormingryocan220> anyone into raccoon girls?
[3:46:54] <%Valdorick> Reminder nerds - If you want a real Catgirl, Cats mate with up to 7 toms in the same period of heat. So you better not be clingy, and be ready for that NTR Kappa
[3:46:55] <Ipsenscastle> don't sesquipidalishame
[3:46:56] <Sol_Install> do you want to fuck the ear?
[3:46:58] <%shurtal> Why do people liek boobies? Or Ayemeric? Or Skeletons
[3:47:00] <$valriot> @angriestpat Cos long ears are easy to grab from behind
[3:47:04] <%ryome> Yatogame-Chan is the cutest catgirl in years and she’s just a human
[3:47:07] <%wolfofsound> @Sol_Install well be fucked by them yes
[3:47:09] <+valkuma> Ah HEE
[3:47:10] <baronvonbirman> Paige didn't know what abivilent meant
[3:47:11] <@CreepyPorpoise> What did I open the stream into
[3:47:12] <%crazyspartan214> the ears are the one part that makes bunny girl likeable!
[3:47:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Because it's kinda different without going full deviant
[3:47:15] <%shadybarman> I may hate the bunny people but I have to agree with Paige on this one
[3:47:17] <CrypticMochi> They’re handles
[3:47:18] <TheHotStuven> I like the tall thin women, can confirm Vieras are bae
[3:47:18] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan I'm too scared to ask, the chuckle I get destroys my spirit
[3:47:18] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@silvcrest) (warning)
[3:47:26] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat there ended a anime just now about some fox girl shit and that was all about the fluffyness of the years and tail
[3:47:27] <%Fatmanjoggin> Is Pat secretly U Ranger
[3:47:28] <+valkuma> Come on chat, Ah HEE with me!
[3:47:28] <silvcrest> Fuck off Moobot
[3:47:32] <baronvonbirman> I spell like an asshole
[3:47:38] <jacknerik> Why he sword pants
[3:47:39] <Wordless1412> cage match please
[3:47:39] <NotSoAccurateNo1> you open the door and find a stray bunny-girl on your door step
[3:47:40] <rosemon5001> ears*
[3:47:51] <Thalchampz> don't underestimate the level rush
[3:47:51] <baronvonbirman> Fat fingers
[3:47:53] <KatabolicRage> 60-70 is apparantly pretty quick now with the bigger armoury bonus
[3:47:54] <%Tallie> hell yeah to 80 its my new main :P
[3:47:56] <+RowenCleric> can we all agree you are both idiots and that is why we watch you
[3:47:57] <Thalchampz> big level rush
[3:48:08] <stormingryocan220> Bunnies fuck a lot irl
[3:48:08] <+valkuma> Pigtails arent organic?
[3:48:16] <%wolfofsound> but pigtails move themselves
[3:48:17] <NotSoAccurateNo1> they're pigtails you can eat
[3:48:17] <%Valdorick> See also on Catgirl ear things - Many people fetishize the idea that the ears are like touching their boobs.
[3:48:20] <%Scarnehu> it's an exotisim thing, it looks 90% familiar but with an unfamiliar/unknown factor
[3:48:28] <%wolfofsound> can't*
[3:48:31] <%crazyspartan214> look at all those quest
[3:48:36] <%Roundelay11> 100% organic free-range pigtails?
[3:48:39] <alrobot2014> what
[3:48:42] <%ryome> After Paige drags him to a furry convention (for a bit), then Pat will understand
[3:48:45] <Ipsenscastle> also they wear lingerie all the time
[3:48:49] <artoflec> i think bunny ears are cute but i dont like pigtails because of the like.. it's for little girls but im gonna put it on an adult girl and that makes me puke
[3:48:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Valdorick I cannot tell you how many fanfics I've read on the subject
[3:48:56] <katocrimson> japan likes the fluffy. mofu mofu is a thing
[3:48:57] <+d00msdaydan> i read a breakdown once of why the bunnysuit is optimized to be the sexiest thing possible
[3:48:59] <Thalchampz> LUL
[3:49:01] <$drbuttss> huh
[3:49:04] <+Estuko> @Valdorick honestly, it's always the hair barley covering the breasts that have become my favorite
[3:49:06] <JSebz> that's like the opposite of reductive
[3:49:07] <%Scarnehu> like when your girl wears lingerie when she usually doesn't
[3:49:09] <TheHotStuven> pigtail hairstyles are gross
[3:49:12] <%wolfofsound> I'll be honest I'm more into centaur women myself, but they also have the ears
[3:49:18] <+valkuma> Ahh HEEE!
[3:49:24] <GeltonZ> Out of curiosity, which server/shard is Pat on?
[3:49:24] <%VantomPayne> its a spy xcom
[3:49:28] <+Gruntini> Phantom Doctrine is cold war XCOM
[3:49:30] <TentacleTouchy_> I have. It's slav XCOM
[3:49:30] <skullnaught> but centaur is differenr
[3:49:32] <NotSoAccurateNo1> can you tie frenchbraides with just the ears
[3:49:34] <+Gruntini> It's pretty good
[3:49:35] <+Deaderhand> imagine your ear canals being in the top of your head jundFeelsBreadMan
[3:49:35] <artoflec> ive heard phantom doctrine is pretty cool
[3:49:37] <%ryome> Is there a skeleton in it?
[3:49:37] <skullnaught> thats a horse dude
[3:49:37] <+BubbaRands> I can't foof a pigtail
[3:49:42] <%sshen> That person is a PLEB
[3:49:46] <%Scarnehu> @wolfofsound like the knight girl in monster masume?
[3:49:46] <%VantomPayne> 0% skeleton content
[3:49:53] <+Estuko> @d00msdaydan shows off the figure, emphasis on the legs, a cute style with the bowtie sometimes and the bunny tail + ears, heels.
[3:49:54] <+Gruntini> You can MK Ultra people
[3:49:54] <baronvonkame> hey pat thanks for being big background noise for my dungeon grinds
[3:49:54] <$Quigsies> Alright Chat, short or long hair?
[3:49:56] <%xemnahort> I like the look of pigtails sometimes but I don’t find it attractive
[3:50:00] <%wolfofsound> @Scarnehu yes, but with abs Kreygasm
[3:50:02] <Aristotlay> Pigtails < Braids in my humblest of opinions
[3:50:05] <%theturtlebar> Pig tails are for very young girls
[3:50:06] <jackythefrost> long
[3:50:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Bunnies have really soft ears
[3:50:07] <TheHotStuven> its not the same!
[3:50:11] <JSebz> Long hair
[3:50:11] <CrypticMochi> @d00msdaydan Your close to the goods, but not quite, leaving you thirsty.
[3:50:15] <skullnaught> @quigsies depends
[3:50:18] <%lionmanguy> !uptime
[3:50:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 50m.
[3:50:19] <%VanaSkiller> whichever looks better on the person
[3:50:20] <+Estuko> PogChamp the Platinum Bosses
[3:50:21] <%Faustgesicht> and they're good for emotional expression
[3:50:22] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Chat, whats your monster masume tier list?
[3:50:25] <+BubbaRands> Not the same a foofin a bun ear
[3:50:25] <GeltonZ> I love Pigtails so much I'm literally the main character of I'm Gonna Be The Pigtail. That anime speaks to me.
[3:50:34] <skullnaught> miia is best
[3:50:34] <%Valdorick> Oh no NotLikeThis why does my brain do this to me... How does a medical x-ray of Miqote and Viera skulls look, with their ear canals ontop of their head!?
[3:50:34] <stormingryocan220> Been on the mood for medium sized hairstyle lately
[3:50:36] <%Roundelay11> I wish you could turn off fate music specifically. So sick of it.
[3:50:36] <GeltonZ> *I'm Gonna Be The Twintail I mean
[3:50:36] <%ryome> Ponytails the best
[3:50:41] <Zombrocom> Yall are weirdos
[3:50:41] <%VantomPayne> its cube, allagan in the first is just pat
[3:50:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hairstyles are cool
[3:50:48] <baronvonbirman> Ronkan almost sounds like the swedish word for masturbation
[3:50:55] <Aristotlay> Braids are easiest to pull when undergoing activities of the night
[3:50:57] <NotSoAccurateNo1> if you cut a spiral pattern into the ear, the ear becomes much longer
[3:51:06] <%wolfofsound> @JustAnotherTrapArtist Centaur, Oni, wrap girl, spider, mosquito, snake, slime, wolfgirl, lamprey, dragon
[3:51:07] <+valkuma> god this music is a banger
[3:51:29] <jackythefrost> They are ontop the towers I think
[3:51:33] <%xemnahort> While I’m not as deep into pigtails I’m super into that name “I’m gonna be the Pigtail”
[3:51:39] <%Scarnehu> @angriestpat this music really slaps. is the whole FF14 soundtrack like this?
[3:51:40] <+BubbaRands> LUL
[3:51:44] <%ovan20> women LUL
[3:51:46] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Blessed list
[3:51:50] <Shindy7> The paige that cried wolf
[3:51:51] <stormingryocan220> and by medium sized hairstyle I mean the one that reach the chin region
[3:51:54] <missingangle> Okay, but how ugly was that dress?
[3:51:54] <Sol_Install> yep
[3:51:55] <Aristotlay> Paige makes Pat wear his hair in pigtails when they do the creepy sex stuff.
[3:51:58] <Sol_Install> that sounds like a woman
[3:52:06] <%shurtal> wtf big steps, HOW DO POTATO GET UP THEM
[3:52:15] <%ryome> I just sigh sometimes, it’s my body’s response to relaxation
[3:52:17] <%wolfofsound> I think chat can all agree that ditto is the holy grail of monster girls
[3:52:18] <alrobot2014> wait how do you make pigtails with hair that short
[3:52:23] <GeltonZ> @xemnahort It's about a guy who loves pigtails so much he gets the power to turn into a pigtailed super loli to defend pigtails from aliens.
[3:52:25] <arkv01> potatos are freakish mutants
[3:52:33] <+valkuma> ya hEE
[3:52:37] <%Bane_Kaikyo> C U B E
[3:52:37] <+vizzay> Potato basketball must be hype as fuck
[3:52:37] <%Fatmanjoggin> potatos are freakish flea beasts
[3:52:39] <%shurtal> So potatos are just Giant Fleas?
[3:52:41] <+Amperture> This music is driving me crazy
[3:52:44] <+Amperture> LAH BEE
[3:52:44] <GeltonZ> @xemnahort It's dumb and most people hate it. But I love dumb.
[3:52:51] <%xemnahort> @geltonz that sounds amazing
[3:52:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> So Paige-Potato or Paige-bunny
[3:53:02] <%Valdorick> GG Pat, gawd
[3:53:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Here's the real question: Why do people love potatoes so much?
[3:53:11] <arkv01> well you know which one would make pats dick happier
[3:53:12] <dekkitout> Potatoes make me laugh every time they're mentioned
[3:53:13] <$Quigsies> I have base edition ffxiv, if I buy Shadowbringers, do I need the other expansions as well or is it included?
[3:53:17] <%Faustgesicht> good taste
[3:53:17] <$drbuttss> paige potatoe
[3:53:19] <arkv01> potato could really work it...
[3:53:19] <GeltonZ> @xemnahort I botched the name slightly, it's I'm Gonna Be The Twintail. But yeah it's out there.
[3:53:21] <%Fatmanjoggin> Roe to be BIG and STRONG
[3:53:21] <SailingSaturn> Potato 🥔 cirISee
[3:53:22] <%rdark_ksu> paige is red potato
[3:53:23] <+valkuma> GarbageQueenEllie people are attracted to trash
[3:53:24] <%wolfofsound> Good choice
[3:53:24] <%Valdorick> @GarbageQueenEllie PedoNEETs
[3:53:25] <Shindy7> What's it like to be red-headed? Does it hurt?
[3:53:27] <%Roundelay11> Yeah, thats not bad
[3:53:30] <stormingryocan220> That's some Kingdom Hearts jumping animations right there
[3:53:31] <%ProtagonistJake> The only reason I want to play this game is for the music is it worth it
[3:53:34] <GeltonZ> FUN FACT: Viera love red hair, they consider it a sign of strength.
[3:53:38] <%wolfofsound> Paige is already dating a potato LUL
[3:53:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> So what about Paige Bunny Potato?
[3:53:40] <%Roundelay11> Peaches Baba
[3:53:41] <Thalchampz> @Quigsies if you buy shadowbringers, you get all the others before it
[3:53:45] <+stella_potato> this game seems like it has insane level of cosmetic freedom. which i am a fan of. im so bad at mmo though
[3:53:45] <%ElenaManetta> When I was a kid, I named my rabbit "Josie", because we had cats. So Josie and the Pussycats
[3:53:55] <%Lapinelis> If all you want is the music, there's spotify
[3:53:56] <BunnyEmperor> LULW just rip it off youtube then
[3:53:56] <+TheImmortal70> Just buy the soundtrack
[3:53:56] <%Scarnehu> Patron does not dream of Bunny-peach senpai
[3:53:59] <$Quigsies> @Thalchampz Awesome, thanks <3
[3:53:59] <arkv01> naw dude back in the day I ran crystal tower JUST for the music
[3:53:59] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat So thats what its liek climbing stairs for you pat jump up everyoen one cause your legs are too small
[3:54:02] <arkv01> I didn't even like the raid
[3:54:05] <alrobot2014> playing games for their music led me to many a great game
[3:54:08] <skullnaught> Nier Gestalt tho
[3:54:09] <SailingSaturn> But thats why I started thjis game cirISee
[3:54:10] <$Afterman_> music aint ever been this good i think
[3:54:14] <katocrimson> unless it's a rhythem game
[3:54:14] <GeltonZ> <- Plays Sonic Forces for the music
[3:54:15] <%Valdorick> Fuck you Pat! I played Persona 3 because I heard Battle for Everyone's Soul!
[3:54:19] <Arweynn> Unless its like, Nier or SotC or something
[3:54:19] <tactician0> do it
[3:54:22] <%ryome> Music is bad and Pat hates your favorite band
[3:54:23] <%ProtagonistJake> Pat your reasoning is sound I will take this advice and run with it
[3:54:40] <+BubbaRands> Watching these jumping animations want me to say "boing~ boing~ boing~" every time i see them
[3:54:47] <$Yakobro> I hit it exactly with it, accessories
[3:54:47] <%theturtlebar> Probably higher than that. AF gear in SB was 290
[3:54:49] <jackythefrost> 4 2 0
[3:54:50] <%Dingus_Tickler> 420? atpSuspect
[3:54:53] <%theturtlebar> And you hit like 310 naturally
[3:54:54] <+TONYOO101> how the hell is she reading that
[3:54:58] <Aristotlay> Pat can I smoke weed in here?
[3:55:09] <%xemnahort> B L A Z E I T
[3:55:12] <%ProtagonistJake> I also hear the stories pretty good though and Id like a good game to just chill out with so might try it out another time
[3:55:13] <stormingryocan220> that's some 90's rock band battle music right there
[3:55:15] <Thalchampz> W E F A L L

[3:55:16] <BunnyEmperor> Oh my god I bet Pat fucks the upcoming riddle up
[3:55:33] <Aristotlay> @BunnyEmperor Thats not fair
[3:55:38] <jackythefrost> I 100% guessed on this one and got it right
[3:55:41] <tactician0> forever fall
[3:55:51] <suikudo> I literally just did it
[3:55:53] <Shindy7> that music is kinda trippy
[3:55:58] <suikudo> and also got it right
[3:56:06] <+BubbaRands> Let Paige solve she's great a puzzles LUL
[3:56:09] <+RowenCleric> Pat doesnt fuck up riddles he only fucks fairy girls

[4:13:21] <%Gogogolem> Get back to the Dps Ghettos.
[4:13:22] <Zombrocom> 22
[4:13:22] <%Valdorick> Hows it feel, Pat, to insult the Al Bed DPS?
[4:13:27] <%Scarnehu> i like the fries that are shaped like smiley faces
[4:13:28] <+BubbaRands> 22! yeah!
[4:13:32] <%wolfofsound> @ElenaManetta basically like flair
[4:13:38] <%titans_ace_jerid> What's wrong with being a tank?
[4:13:38] <%rdark_ksu> dps more fun anyway
[4:13:39] <%ElenaManetta> I thought flair was a tag
[4:13:42] <BunnyEmperor> because healer is boring now
[4:13:44] <%ryome> DPS are the pregnant women in the grocery line of MMOs, Paige
[4:13:46] <%Lapinelis> Healers are basically the nannies of the group
[4:13:47] <%yeknomlive> especially now more than ever. rip sch
[4:13:48] <%Mekhet09> Healers are now more boring than before.
[4:13:49] <floatRand> Plus healers got fucking knocked about
[4:13:50] <+BubbaRands> 16
[4:13:55] <%Suchawus> DOnt forget Rescuing people into mechanics
[4:13:57] <%sshen> Unless you are that AST from your titania battle Pat
[4:13:59] <%yeknomlive> you know what i do with aetherflows is just sacred soil on cd
[4:14:04] <dekkitout> No, healers go "STOP. DYING,"
[4:14:04] <%Mekhet09> SCH and AST got boring as fuck.
[4:14:05] <floatRand> Also, as healers we decide who lives and dies
[4:14:09] <SailingSaturn> Chemist are lame cirREE
[4:14:10] <BunnyEmperor> Chemist or Salve Maker really good choice
[4:14:11] <%ElenaManetta> There are only two types of people who play healers in every video game: Newbies who want to be useful because they're new or jaded fucks who have been playing for way too long
[4:14:12] <Daxalog> Pelting people with bottles
[4:14:12] <$NitronStreams> DRUGS
[4:14:12] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan when people depend on you but make fun of you everywhere else as a Healer
[4:14:22] <%VanaSkiller> GLASS HIM

[4:14:32] <%Dingus_Tickler> Slap the Tank in the back of the nexk
[4:14:33] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat oh less than 10 min ain't bad cirISee

[4:14:35] <Aristotlay> Glass him
[4:14:35] <%Dingus_Tickler> Neck
[4:14:35] <+buttdirt> I want doom guy as a healer, heals with brutality

[4:15:03] <%dantegus> 6
[4:15:04] <Ipsenscastle> GLASS HIM
[4:15:05] <%ElenaManetta> Hold up your six fingers
[4:15:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> We almost in there
[4:15:11] <%VioletHeart> Being a tank has made me more bitter about other players than a healer ever did, because as a healer main I can *tell* when the healer's not doing their job properly.
[4:15:15] <+Masutasodo> Oh sweet, good thing I'm a warbro
[4:15:23] <%ArcanumMBD> Which sucks. I wanted my hammer job

[4:16:22] <Ipsenscastle> feel like FF7 doesn't really require much in the way of tips, just dont stress about doing things 'right', it'll be fine
[4:16:27] <+RowenCleric> enemy skill is great have it on all the time, always steal stuff
[4:16:30] <$valriot> Patron, try to remember the basics of FFXIV
[4:16:44] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat This instance is really fucking weird
[4:16:50] <%joylent_blue> FF7 tip: always have enemy skill equipped
[4:16:58] <CrypticMochi> The thing Liam played?
[4:16:59] <%king_wragles> Anima Gate of Memories is like Anima Gate of Thought but more philosophical
[4:16:59] <%Odysseusftw> lol shot the fuck down quick
[4:16:59] <+BubbaRands> Knots. Another thing people love about animal people apparently Kappa
[4:17:07] <+Estuko> @BubbaRands TwitchCop
[4:17:18] <%wolfofsound> @BubbaRands oh boy
[4:17:18] <+Hinasil> Anima is basicaly Devil May Cry, but full of anime

[4:17:42] <%wolfofsound> [REDACTED} @RantingRavager
[4:17:43] <icosahedralAPOI> Wow, every data center in FF14 is not accepting characters
[4:17:45] <%Doruben> sbfpLiam sbfpLiam sbfpLiam

[4:17:57] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat that a fairy sword?
[4:17:57] <%Dynamoheart> Liam played it on his stream, it wasn't great.
[4:18:00] <alrobot2014> EVERY DATA CENTER?

[4:18:25] <+RowenCleric> Anima is a really bad Nier 1 clone...
[4:18:34] <Rahura159> Transistor is on Switch, right? That's good.
[4:18:36] <+RowenCleric> and Nier 1 is not great gameplay ways...
[4:18:40] <icosahedralAPOI> I literally haven't been able to make my first character in 2 days

[4:28:44] <KatabolicRage> using rescue to drop him down a pit, like a real healer
[4:28:46] <%Divryne> Get fucked by meme ability.
[4:28:49] <%Mekhet09> That's an illegal use of rescue.
[4:28:50] <%ArcanumMBD> urianger just a troll
[4:28:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Ipsenscastle Just as the prophecy fortold!
[4:28:55] <+Estuko> OH. THAT'S SUPER COOL
[4:28:56] <+Zxtole> What if you could pull bosses with rescue
[4:28:56] <KatabolicRage> 80% of rescue's I see wind up killing the target
[4:28:57] <%Suchawus> "Save from an AoE"
[4:28:58] <+BubbaRands> Now it's YOUR turn to fall into the pit
[4:28:58] <%TysonPG> they basically did what the healer did to you in the frog fight
[4:28:59] <%sshen> He did what happened to you in the pixie dungeon
[4:29:09] <BunnyEmperor> Or drag you into a pit
[4:29:11] <%Roundelay11> Shirk killing is funnier
[4:29:14] <IFlaske> healers have a god complex its awesome
[4:29:14] <BunnyEmperor> RIGHT PAT
[4:29:15] <%Bigdrifter210> JUMP IN THE PIT
[4:29:15] <CrypticMochi> Just like you in that pit
[4:29:19] <%rdark_ksu> thats actually pretty clever
[4:29:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> Shirk on that one DPS of they pull too early
[4:29:26] <dekkitout> Oh that sounds rad for a healer
[4:29:32] <corrosivePaladin> You mean like the healer that kept pulling you into that pit while you were doing a tightrope walk?
[4:29:32] <%king_wragles> so what's the over under on the mage who fell?
[4:29:38] <+vizzay> Yeah BLM don't like it when you use Rescue on them lol
[4:29:44] <gekizenbu> Y'shtola will be fine
[4:29:47] <spankadelic_> replace this background music with the mystic ruins song from sonic adventure
[4:29:50] <gekizenbu> this is normal
[4:29:58] <%RittiFruity> I got rescued into a pit at the last boss in lvl 73 dungeon boss... they they respond with "XD"
[4:30:00] <%SlowLikeThunder> I don't have any macros set up atm but I swear to god I need to make one that just says "Turn away to avoid gaze attacks!" because jesus
[4:30:02] <+BubbaRands> Let's jump in and find out
[4:30:05] <%SlowLikeThunder> no one ever does it
[4:30:11] <%weissguard> Cats always land on their feet.
[4:30:19] <+Estuko> "She has a hole punch-card for her deaths, if she dies two more times she gets a free sundae."
[4:30:19] <%Bane_Kaikyo> C U T E B U N N Y
[4:30:21] <%Suchawus> This area is such a rollercoaster
[4:30:36] <orangemdt> wtf do these beastmen's skulls look like? Those ears are confusing af
[4:30:36] <+Artemis_Scowl> a betrayed bad guy, a bad guy and a hero fell into it. that's a safety pit lol
[4:30:53] <+Estuko> @orangemdt it's fine theyre hot
[4:30:57] <Rahura159> She'll die on the 9th death
[4:31:01] <GandhiTheTerrible> yeah, pretty much
[4:31:04] <MSN04_Sazabi> They couldn't be less dead
[4:31:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> In that case, Minfilia owns a whole fucking Ice Cream Shop
[4:31:09] <%king_wragles> I thought it was a plot pit?
[4:31:14] <%Gogogolem> why you dieing , why always dying why you always fucking DyING!
[4:31:20] <+valkuma> my money is on that Ran'jit is a god inside a mortal body or something. Hes unnaturally powerful
[4:31:33] <alrobot2014> its amazing she manages to only be blind with all the times she's died
[4:31:33] <suikudo> This is what the 5th time they "killed" Yshtola?
[4:31:37] <+BubbaRands> Y'shtola is the Mista of FFXIV
[4:31:38] <NotSoAccurateNo1> down the rescue hole
[4:31:39] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat what if you just Crazy Talked her into being for real dead?
[4:31:47] <+FruitlessEndeavor> Pat how's DRK 70+ so far? Is it big fun?
[4:31:54] <lionsignal> what
[4:31:57] <Rahura159> She might as well not even be blind either
[4:32:00] <$Yakobro> wow
[4:32:07] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat holyshit theres a dark knight sword thats just a giant taser
[4:32:11] <%Faustgesicht> Death wasn't on screen. Not dead
[4:32:16] <orangemdt> this is my first ff14 stream, and I'm so confused
[4:32:29] <+StrawberryPantsu> 70+ GNB> 70+ DRK
[4:32:30] <%Divryne> I can't believe Ystola is dead FOREVER.
[4:32:46] <CrypticMochi> She would be fine even with an on screen death
[4:32:47] <%Faustgesicht> 4EVA
[4:32:53] <+BubbaRands> Keep pumping his veins
[4:32:58] <%VanaSkiller> Forevaeva?
[4:33:04] <+cephaloboss> "you poisoned him with too much antidote"
[4:33:29] <Zombrocom> We gonna need more antidote
[4:33:32] <+BubbaRands> Great, now he's addicted to the antidote
[4:33:34] <dredshift> Is Poisona not a spell in this game
[4:33:43] <Calek> Esuna is
[4:33:46] <%Gogogolem> the bunny women will give him handjobs till hes better
[4:34:00] <+RowenCleric> classic flashback to 2 seconds ago
[4:34:01] <%xemnahort> Nope but there is esuna
[4:34:03] <orangemdt> can't believe cat lady is fucking dead
[4:34:06] <+Estuko> I'm still curious about the ear jobs someone mentioned a while ago
[4:34:11] <%Faustgesicht> hey remember that sacrifice to 2 minutes ago
[4:34:15] <gekizenbu> we traded a large cat boy and too many lives in exchange for losing a cat lady
[4:34:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Estuko SO many fanfics, my dude
[4:34:30] <gekizenbu> @Estuko probably something like deepthroating the ears
[4:34:38] <Zombrocom> Chat no
[4:34:39] <lionsignal> is that squall?
[4:34:39] <+BubbaRands> @Faustgesicht No Let's flashback to it again.

[4:34:49] <+Estuko> @gekizenbu @GarbageQueenEllie Oh
[4:34:58] <%rytyoung> oh no what have I stumbled into
[4:35:10] <gekizenbu> the furry dick convention, probably
[4:35:24] <%rdark_ksu> Ok so if that guy is just a giant cat person....think he uses toilet paper?
[4:35:30] <%wolfofsound> that barbed dick is gonna get alotta work in a moment
[4:35:33] <orangemdt> @gekizenbu like they just role them up and stuff 'em like cinnabons?
[4:35:34] <+BubbaRands> Cat men or Bishi Elves?
[4:35:38] <%rytyoung> imma stick around...not for the furries...
[4:35:40] <%Faustgesicht> @BubbaRands You're right, i had to take a break to mourn the character whose died 5 or 6 times
[4:35:54] <%king_wragles> she got Goku'd
[4:36:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Cat bois are worse than cat girls because of the barbed junk. And spraying
[4:36:28] <orangemdt> I can't believe they show the mute animations XD
[4:36:34] <%xemnahort> She got goku’d is the best way to put this
[4:36:36] <%wolfofsound> @GarbageQueenEllie "Ripped for her pleasure"
[4:36:56] <floatRand> A non-spoiler spoiler: final area is real fucking cool
[4:36:57] <stormingryocan220> thing is catgirls strangely like the barbed dicl
[4:36:59] <floatRand> real chill, too
[4:37:05] <+valkuma> small cat lady is big important to these big cat men
[4:37:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> Poor C2 Daddy...

[4:37:11] <KatabolicRage> that big cat man is very sad
[4:37:13] <+BubbaRands> "Barbed for your mutilation"
[4:37:26] <Rahura159> He wants to yiff her real bad
[4:37:29] <+Estuko> I want Patron to look at him and say "This your first time? Lol"
[4:37:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> "It should've been you instead, you son of a bitch"
[4:37:35] <orangemdt> I thought she was just gonna walk in
[4:37:43] <$Yakobro> MA BOI

[4:38:05] <gekizenbu> our best friend
[4:38:07] <+cephaloboss> slime man
[4:38:20] <%mor_materia_company> Pat sighs... But Solus is easily the most entertaining charatcer in the game.
[4:38:28] <Belutima> itmejpSMUG itmejpSMUG itmejpSMUG itmejpSMUG itmejpSMUG itmejpSMUG itmejpSMUG

[4:39:06] <+Zxtole> He's going to follow you and see everything anyway, might as well have him plainly seen
[4:39:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Every mmo has that one character that nobody fucking likes. Every mmo has a solus and he is always a BITCH
[4:39:20] <%xemnahort> It’s never easy to lose the ones we love... again
[4:39:24] <CrypticMochi> “She’ll be back in an hour”
[4:39:25] <+Mottyrob> Not so best that she'd do an LP though
[4:39:26] <jackythefrost> Solus is great tho
[4:39:26] <+valkuma> yshtola spent 2 years in Big Muscle Cat forest dont tell me she doesnt have any little cat babies

[4:39:58] <%rdark_ksu> oh idk the sad thing that happened
[4:40:00] <%xemnahort> Honestly why are the characters actually not considering she survived considering how many deaths she had
[4:40:02] <corrosivePaladin> If shes died like 3 times now why does your character even care still?
[4:40:12] <Ipsenscastle> Pat you should write anime
[4:40:13] <%Tearonex> @Zombrocom Taller than irl Pat though

[4:47:26] <transporterthesequel> @AngriestPat I actually have a pretty big question. How many times have you been shouted out as a DRK in the MSQ. This is actually super important for me

[4:59:12] <SailingSaturn> @Belutima it kind of is cirLaugh
[4:59:14] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hey pat did you hear about people printing free money with the steam summer sale?
[4:59:21] <haitakaa> it means horny
[4:59:21] <SPidERMan8576> Tinklebell??
[4:59:22] <Zombrocom> producing or capable of producing an abundance of offspring or new growth; fertile.
[4:59:22] <%ryome> Fertile
[4:59:26] <KishinGrek> You can now buy a mount that was only earned now
[4:59:40] <%wolfofsound> ah that sounds about right
[4:59:41] <+BubbaRands> Bunny Fertility Ritual?
[4:59:41] <Zombrocom> In other words, bunny girls are the exact opposite of bunnys
[4:59:53] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:55] <Zombrocom> fe - cund
[4:59:58] <%rdark_ksu> Fecund, means very fertile. Likely to have a shit load of kids
[4:59:59] <KishinGrek> Feck
[5:00:02] <SPidERMan8576> Bunny girls with high heels
[5:00:06] <haitakaa> I guess when everyone is a sexy bunny girl you get tired of the constant boner and it just goes away
[5:00:32] <%MoraMiarty> viera are actually super horny and the males live separately to avoid being raped
[5:00:37] <KatabolicRage> I can't imagine how their males even continue to exist in a world full of sineaters
[5:00:45] <Mr_Strut> It means that every day is a safe day
[5:00:48] <+BubbaRands> Well that kinda ruins the fantasy
[5:00:51] <KishinGrek> Cuz devs dont like to use condoms
[5:00:52] <+Zxtole> Death by snu snu
[5:00:53] <%Lapinelis> So bunnies ain't fucking like bunnies? Truly an apocalyptic world
[5:00:59] <SPidERMan8576> Viera like snu snu so much they killed all the males
[5:01:00] <haitakaa> I can't believe the subtitles are STILL this small after all these expansions
[5:01:01] <%wolfofsound> nah just means you have to keep trying Kappa
[5:01:06] <ExpressNode> @MoraMiarty I was gonna mention that because I thought FF12 mentioned that
[5:01:33] <haitakaa> where's muh Ritz at tho
[5:02:17] <GreyFoxHoundDD> By the eyes of Panthera. Thunder! Thunder! THUNDERCATS! HOOOOOOOOO
[5:02:32] <%ryome> The bunnies do NOT get porked up
[5:02:50] <KatabolicRage> pat do you not know what northeast is
[5:02:50] <SPidERMan8576> The bunnies lay eggs
[5:02:53] <+VashyronM> Matoya #1 Waifu
[5:02:59] <+BubbaRands> The bunnies don't pork at all
[5:03:01] <haitakaa> I guarentee there's art of Viera being pregnant with like 12 kids at once like a real bunny
[5:03:10] <KishinGrek> No they do , they just dont get preggo
[5:03:28] <KatabolicRage> my understanding of the viera is they DO bang like bunnies but they can only do that when a exceedingly rare bunnyboi comes to town which is almost never
[5:03:35] <+Solshine11> That Opo-opo just slapped your ass LUL
[5:03:38] <alrobot2014> explain the easter bunny then pat
[5:03:40] <+StrawberryPantsu> Bunnies do in fact lay eggs
[5:03:42] <Daxalog> Explain the easter bunny then? Checkmate
[5:03:43] <arkv01> bunnies spawn caviar
[5:03:50] <haitakaa> all the males live in separate villages
[5:03:50] <RottenK> Not according to my fanfiction, Pat!
[5:03:51] <+BubbaRands> The male bunnies do.
[5:03:51] <+valkuma> Normal bunnies dont lay eggs but these are fantasy bunnies
[5:03:54] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Fran got pretty hot and bothered when she was in the Mist. Of course, she killed like 4 dudes in full suits of armor with her bare hands.
[5:04:01] <KishinGrek> They reproduce via mitosis
[5:04:01] <SPidERMan8576> Isekai , i was reborn into a bunny boi viera
[5:04:03] <alrobot2014> i accept that
[5:04:04] <%Sirculbs> Have you ever seen a bunny not lay an egg?
[5:04:04] <Katorskay> he's jesus

[5:09:17] <SPidERMan8576> Pat looks like a different vers of kratos
[5:09:18] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @BubbaRands I thought that too, and that makes more sense, but the actual lyrics are "Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey"

[5:11:14] <%Toast_Master_General> New lore
[5:11:15] <+BubbaRands> @GreyFoxHoundDD "There sits a greying tower alone on the sea" So it more sense to use "grey" than "grave"
[5:11:19] <%damienlunas> So that's why pat kept talking about Rose Buds.
[5:11:20] <%Zundelle> asshole exposed on stream
[5:11:21] <+ThruLidlessEye> oh lord

[5:11:48] <jackythefrost> I think Im almost at the Innocence primal fight which is cool
[5:11:48] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @BubbaRands I'll be real, i only remember the hook to that song because of Batman.
[5:11:51] <TalisKanju> Why is YOUR ROOM so bright?
[5:12:00] <$Afterman_> just dont do it to the point you make your skin dried and cracked, otherwise germs get in there better
[5:12:02] <SPidERMan8576> ( TwitchSings )
[5:12:07] <%damienlunas> And a lot of shit comes out
[5:12:08] <%Doruben> it had lights, who knew
[5:12:09] <%Valdorick> Nailed it
[5:12:13] <+sixcubit> baffling that they took so long to add viera, i'll bet it's been a fan request since launch

[5:12:53] <%xemnahort> @kishingrek farting would be awkward
[5:12:53] <alrobot2014> wait what that's news to me
[5:12:56] <+BubbaRands> @GreyFoxHoundDD Same.
[5:12:57] <alrobot2014> oh inside
[5:12:58] <ExpressNode> You mean orifice?
[5:12:59] <+ThruLidlessEye> you got spincters inside you
[5:13:04] <derap41> you have 2
[5:13:06] <@Fuggins4U> Pat is all sphincter.
[5:13:08] <+Zxtole> No one tell him about veins
[5:13:09] <haitakaa> An asshole can rip like tissue paper Paigee
[5:13:10] <%SlowLikeThunder> when you think about it you're really just one big sphincter
[5:13:13] <%damienlunas> There are over 60 types of sphincters in the human body, Pat.
[5:13:14] <dredshift> Your eyes have sphincters Pat
[5:13:17] <%ryome> You do @NotSoAccurateNo1
[5:13:18] <spankadelic_> your eye is a sphincter
[5:13:18] <InugamiTheHound> pat is full of shit LOL
[5:13:21] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat there's 2 for your stomach... I think the intestines have a few and maybe one at the base of your throat?
[5:13:23] <%dave323dave> you don't want shit going backwards
[5:13:23] <Kefkaisnotamused> It contracts and.... shit!
[5:13:27] <%MoraMiarty> AHHHHHHHH
[5:13:30] <%damienlunas> Your body is RIDDLED with sphincters.
[5:13:32] <%shurtal> IF Metal Gear Solid 2 taught me anything, it's that ships have sphincters everywhere
[5:13:33] <%mastertwin2> Pat "Entirely Sphincter" Biovin
[5:13:37] <hntronium> Your skin is just made up of countless miniature sphincters
[5:13:38] <KishinGrek> The throat is a sphincter
[5:13:43] <baronvonkame> pat what were you doing there to your duty list?
[5:13:52] <%xemnahort> I’m liking these roulettes a lot
[5:13:54] <Kefkaisnotamused> Your sphincters have sphincters everywhere.
[5:13:57] <@Fuggins4U> SphincterestPat
[5:13:59] <%weissguard> WutFace
[5:13:59] <haitakaa> Pat "Only Sphincter" "Poop God" Boyminivan
[5:14:05] <%king_wragles> A sphincter is essentially just a shut off valve
[5:14:05] <Erictron4000> your pores are holes
[5:14:06] <hntronium> You're basically one big butthole
[5:14:06] <+lucaflow> Pat's stream is just one big giant sphincter
[5:14:06] <alrobot2014> we can't ruin the human body for pat any further can we
[5:14:10] <+Williamld> Become the warrior of Sphincter @AngriestPat
[5:14:15] <spankadelic_> xd
[5:14:16] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat theres a sphincter in your throat right now
[5:14:18] <hntronium> Made up of smaller buttholes
[5:14:21] <baronvonkame> yeah but you were like flicking the duty on/off doing or something for hero in need
[5:14:22] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat what player race would you most want added to this game?
[5:14:30] <%SlowLikeThunder> what if instead of the Sin Eaters it was the Sphinct-Eaters and they were trying to bring about the flood of sphincters, that's basicallyt your body at all times @AngriestPat
[5:14:34] <%weissguard> Toll BOOTY
[5:14:56] <rosemon5001> that would make me furios having soo many undone sutff
[5:15:05] <%xemnahort> @haitakaa I know that was autocorrect but making it Boyminivan makes it so much funnier
[5:15:12] <haitakaa> damn that feel when you realize Skeletons don't have buttholes FeelsBadMan
[5:15:17] <%itschickenscratch> @baronvonkame he was just checking which roles were being requested for the roulettes
[5:15:26] <baronvonkame> Is La No-see-ya confirmed? I always say La Nos-ya
[5:15:30] <KishinGrek> Hey Pat, whats the worst expansion for FFO?
[5:15:38] <%damienlunas> There's a sphincter at the top of your stomach that keeps your gut juice from coming out so you don't just leak like a wet plastic bag every time you turn upside down.
[5:15:54] <KishinGrek> Yes
[5:16:02] <haitakaa> if you go long enough without pooping the shit will actually come up your throat and out your mouth no joke
[5:16:02] <%xemnahort> @baronvonkame they pronounce it nes ka
[5:16:03] <%Kain5707> stormblood
[5:16:14] <%Divryne> The worst FFXIV expansion is the base game.
[5:16:15] <+Zxtole> Does 1.0 count?
[5:16:24] <%Dwarven_Gaming> even then
[5:16:26] <%Dwarven_Gaming> it was BAD

[5:17:01] <%mastertwin2> Wait what even
[5:17:02] <$Afterman_> south park was right
[5:17:03] <alrobot2014> that sounds horrifying
[5:17:09] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you know of someone
[5:17:10] <%dave323dave> dont think it works like that
[5:17:11] <+Zxtole> The digestive tract is basically just a long ass tube to the outside world
[5:17:15] <MasterDecoder> That's a surprising amount of backed up, damn
[5:17:16] <TeaJayGee> was it you?
[5:17:17] <haitakaa> fecal vomiting
[5:17:23] <haitakaa> is a medical term
[5:17:25] <%king_wragles> I'd rather be eaten alive tbh
[5:17:27] <InugamiTheHound> how is that possible?
[5:17:30] <+valkuma> how do you do that? do you just stitch your butthole closed?
[5:17:32] <ExpressNode> sounds like that south park episode
[5:17:34] <%xemnahort> I remember once as a kid I vomited up something that looked like a poop still don’t know how that happened
[5:17:38] <%weissguard> I'm imagining one of the first cutscenes of this expansion, only brown now. That's rough.
[5:17:42] <Kefkaisnotamused> So.. best way to kill your enemies... glue their asshole shut and enjoy their suffering?
[5:17:44] <%MoraMiarty> wow I can't believe you failed thtat fate
[5:17:46] <Daxalog> Look whos the Patologica Liar now!
[5:17:46] <KishinGrek> Didnt the little from poltergeist die from that?
[5:17:51] <haitakaa> if you have a bowel blockage
[5:17:56] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat looking at the wiki, jesus christ there are so many DPS classes. no wonder queue is hell
[5:17:58] <%Doruben> always poop
[5:18:07] <%JGardner88> Man that reminds me I experienced my first 0.1% wipe on a Tsukoyomi roulette, that Lunacy/Fans combo still is tricky apparently
[5:18:07] <+BubbaRands> You're intentionally avoiding taking a dump if you die from that.
[5:18:18] <+valkuma> @sixcubit that and they made healers balls boring to play
[5:18:26] <KishinGrek> Didnt the little girl from poltergeist die from that?
[5:18:39] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Being a healer is fuckin stressful
[5:18:41] <%correctedsun117> Take Metamucil, that's shit's not just for old people (No pun intended). It literally makes the whole shitting process easier and cleaner.
[5:18:44] <TeaJayGee> two people have died in my hometown becuase poop got in the water
[5:18:44] <@JustinianKnight> Also Ranged/Caster/Meele are seperate
[5:18:48] <BunnyEmperor> Its normal mode
[5:18:49] <Kefkaisnotamused> Google that 'shit'.
[5:18:49] <Daxalog> I mean, how many ways can you Heal or support someone? How many ways can you take damage?
[5:18:51] <+Masutasodo> Tsukiyomi LUL

[5:19:22] <%terminallyCapriciousz> I.. don't remember this fight?
[5:19:24] <%Lapinelis> Think this, who do you want to play as? The nanny of the party (healer), the class rep (tank), or the dude that explodes shit
[5:19:29] <+Zxtole> You can do a lot of cool things with healing. Time mages, Darkest Dungeon blood healing. Shaman rituals. There's a lot of creativity to be explored
[5:19:34] <%Valdorick> You pulled threat off him at pull LUL

[5:22:39] <%terminallyCapriciousz> apatDab
[5:22:40] <baronvonkame> I forgot how pretty tsuku phase 1's music is
[5:22:45] <snowmanse> People are confusing Tsukuyomi with Yotsuyu. Yotsuyu is from the art book, Tsukuyomi is crafted
[5:22:46] <%rdark_ksu> pat is never naked because of the filth that is human body
[5:22:52] <TeaJayGee> nothing like the feeling of the wind on your schlong
[5:23:02] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat they made class changes but is machinist still ass?

[5:23:59] <+Can_Do_Kamel> holy moly the music in this game rules
[5:24:00] <GreyFoxHoundDD> She sounds like the Spider Queen from that map in HotS
[5:24:01] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @sixcubit just needs some small adjustments here and there
[5:24:03] <@JustinianKnight> Tsukuyomi crafted item is a housing doll

[5:24:56] <Kefkaisnotamused> People in this game are just really, really bad.
[5:24:57] <%mor_materia_company> How is it different in EX?
[5:24:57] <+saaneart> as someone who's only listened to the ff14 soundtrack. haring tsukuyomi's voice for the first time she sounds awful
[5:24:59] <%Doruben> wipe?
[5:25:03] <%weissguard> Jesus
[5:25:07] <GreyFoxHoundDD> That ninja just took it again
[5:25:09] <@JustinianKnight> jump pots

[5:25:27] <+Raidou24> Jesus christ
[5:25:32] <%poker4121> people jumping back in
[5:25:33] <+lucaflow> That is one bad NIN
[5:25:53] <+lucaflow> They must be the new player
[5:26:01] <%yeknomlive> maybe they're trying to learn new rotation
[5:26:13] <@JustinianKnight> rotation is not new
[5:26:16] <@JustinianKnight> for Nin
[5:26:19] <%Doruben> No dps anytime
[5:26:21] <+lucaflow> Yeah it's still the same
[5:26:24] <%VantomPayne> and learning new notation has nothing to do with not standing in bad
[5:26:30] <BigShay93> got to give square credit they can make flashy raid bosses and badass music
[5:26:42] <+lucaflow> And why would you practice a rotation on a trial boss?
[5:27:02] <%weissguard> That cone is comically huge
[5:27:08] <%damienlunas> What the fuck, that AST just used Aspected Helios when everyone was at FULL HEALTH.
[5:27:09] <+Solshine11> I forgot that she had an Akh mourn
[5:27:17] <Axle13j> Cooool

[5:28:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> There ya go
[5:28:24] <$Afterman_> LUL
[5:28:25] <%Valdorick> So, Serious question - how many bosses have tank swap mechanics? Because I've never seen Pat need to swap with the tank.
[5:28:25] <+Zxtole> Everyone keep an eye on Novice chat
[5:28:30] <gigacanuck> >salted earth Kappa
[5:28:32] <baronvonkame> refugees?
[5:28:34] <+lucaflow> When the whole squad is bad lol
[5:28:40] <KatabolicRage> tank swaps are generally the realm of savage and extreme content
[5:28:45] <@JustinianKnight> 'toxic pat' justin92NoxusFace
[5:28:45] <%Kain5707> LUL jesus
[5:28:46] <KatabolicRage> it's pretty rare in regular stuff
[5:28:47] <%JGardner88> @valdorick thats mostly a Extreme trial mechanic
[5:28:48] <%yeknomlive> dead again
[5:28:53] <%VioletHeart> This is a great fight though. Did it yesterday and it's tons of fun.
[5:28:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> THis is some class memes fam
[5:28:54] <%VanaSkiller> LUL
[5:28:55] <%Doruben> apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat
[5:28:56] <fugnuggets01> ninja lul
[5:28:56] <Jeemukun> well this got very weeb-y all of a sudden
[5:28:56] <%VantomPayne> most ex/savage have them
[5:28:59] <+lucaflow> This game is HARD Pat
[5:29:03] <%Kain5707> its really not hard
[5:29:04] <@JustinianKnight> I'm kiddin
[5:29:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nah, you're fine
[5:29:04] <+lucaflow> Stop being toxic Pat lol
[5:29:06] <%Kain5707> just look
[5:29:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> this is memes
[5:29:08] <TheHotStuven> Not even pat
[5:29:09] <+saaneart> was axl D ever alive in this battle lmao
[5:29:11] <haitakaa> A suicidal ninja sounds like a cool D&D character
[5:29:12] <$Afterman_> this is amazing
[5:29:12] <+WizardofAahz> He's just ninjitsu hiding his healthbar pat
[5:29:24] <%Valdorick> Oh god... Tank DPS, you can save it
[5:29:25] <Zombrocom> Yes
[5:29:25] <%MoraMiarty> according to square it is
[5:29:27] <%JGardner88> 0.1% Wipe HYPE
[5:29:28] <baronvonkame> imagine being a loldrg in another class
[5:29:29] <%ryome> >expecting people to be good at their chosen job?
[5:29:30] <$Afterman_> they lost
[5:29:32] <+Masutasodo> They might be all first time LUL
[5:29:32] <$Afterman_> they loist
[5:29:34] <Jeemukun> also wow, i've never seen Pat's place so bright
[5:29:37] <+xGreenflame> To be fair the ninja has died to EVERY attack
[5:29:39] <haitakaa> it'd be toxic if Pat was screaming in the chat in all caps
[5:29:40] <%mor_materia_company> Remember pat. "Some people are just trying to enjoy content"
[5:29:41] <+Solshine11> It’s not toxic so long as you don’t say it in chat.
[5:29:41] <DRAGKUDO> Yes Paige that is what the internet believes
[5:29:42] <+Zxtole> Anything less than pure happiness is toxicity, obviously
[5:29:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its become a thing for a while
[5:29:44] <+TONYOO101> its not toxic if you dont type at them in chat
[5:29:46] <InugamiTheHound> pat is being secretly toxic LOL
[5:29:53] <@JustinianKnight> oh my god living through mechanics is so toxic
[5:29:54] <%ElenaManetta> I don't like the idea of just complaining means you're being toxic
[5:29:54] <+lucaflow> Healer is not even bothering raising them again lol
[5:29:56] <%Valdorick> Fuck'n Carried
[5:29:59] <+justianxix> Pat wins it for the team LUL
[5:29:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> Great Carry fam
[5:30:01] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@sixcubit) (warning)
[5:30:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat is more of salty
[5:30:04] <Jeemukun> pat is very shiney now
[5:30:04] <baronvonkame> @AngriestPat go rub some icy hot on your shoulders mate
[5:30:06] <$Afterman_> wooow
[5:30:08] <%Doruben> they are all viewing cutscene
[5:30:11] <DRAGKUDO> Saying it's not my tempo is considered toxic
[5:30:19] <%VantomPayne> ive seen bad tsukuyomi runs, but this is just
[5:30:22] <+sixcubit> born to tank, world is a fuck, 410 billion dead DPS
[5:30:22] <gigacanuck> @ElenaManetta here here, you gotta be a special kind of complainer to be toxic
[5:30:22] <shiny_prinny> it's not toxic to be annoyed, it depends on how you communicate to the team
[5:30:25] <KatabolicRage> I feel like "toxic" is a word that gets misused, calling someone bad bad is not toxic
[5:30:28] <$Afterman_> be a good boy
[5:30:32] <BunnyEmperor> its not toxic when pat is the highest dps as drk
[5:30:33] <@JustinianKnight> hey you did it tho
[5:30:35] <Daxalog> Toxicity is when it spreads to others.
[5:30:35] <%sshen> You don't pay their sub pat
[5:30:36] <@JustinianKnight> good enough
[5:30:36] <ComboDonut> coxS
[5:30:39] <+lucaflow> Yeah those DPS were baaaaaad
[5:30:39] <%MoraMiarty> skip potions
[5:30:40] <$Afterman_> all thgat matter is you won
[5:30:44] <@JustinianKnight> justin92NoxusFace
[5:30:44] <%sshen> you pay $30 for the jump potion
[5:30:45] <gigacanuck> speed leveling mechanics
[5:30:46] <%solomonpun> Being mad isn't a bad thing, being mad and being shitty to someone is being toxic.
[5:30:46] <%Valdorick> Salt is good in small doses, but becomes toxic after too long.
[5:30:48] <Calek> they just want to enjoy the content Kappa
[5:30:48] <+Superstartee> That jump attack out of the bosses attack circle was awesome pat
[5:30:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Now Pat is Toxic
[5:30:49] <+lucaflow> Jump potions is how Pat
[5:30:49] <%damienlunas> @AngriestPat That Astro did noooot deserve a commend. He casted helios to get everyone to full, then casted aspected helios while everyone was still full.
[5:30:49] <%mastertwin2> Levelling Potion
[5:30:51] <$The_Cassowary> I'm level 15 and know how to do that lol
[5:30:53] <haitakaa> GRRM apparently said that everyone who complained about Season 8 on the internet is Toxic
[5:30:56] <+valkuma> "you dont pay their sub" is the worst
[5:30:57] <gigacanuck> so is the podcast tomorrow or Tuesday?
[5:30:57] <+Zxtole> Any word normies discover instantly gets used everywhere
[5:30:58] <frostech8> That was horrendous
[5:31:05] <+Raidou24> Jump Potions of course
[5:31:14] <MSN04_Sazabi> Honestly, they probably shouldn't pay their sub either LUL Improve the game LUL
[5:31:15] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I dunno ho to do that, but my highst is like.... 31
[5:31:18] <%VioletHeart> @damienlunas Aspected Helios does almost no healing anymore. It's all for the sect benefit.
[5:31:23] <fairore> lol
[5:31:31] <%weissguard> Dude, when I did those, it was great
[5:31:35] <%xemnahort> @damienlunas that ast was also the only one outside of tanks that knew how to dodge
[5:31:35] <%solomonpun> @AngriestPat How many of those people you think used jump potions?
[5:31:39] <%Doruben> but dodging AoEs is natural for any game
[5:31:39] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat "i played wow i know how to play mmos"
[5:31:43] <+valkuma> But even if you do dungeons you have to learn that shit, and it matters more in dungeons because theres so few players.
[5:31:43] <KatabolicRage> I did those even though I predate them cos the gear from them is great at level 15
[5:31:43] <baronvonkame> I didn't do it either I learned it on the mean streets
[5:31:45] <+lucaflow> Oh the Hall of Novices?
[5:31:45] <%weissguard> Like, I actually learned stuff from those quests. @AngriestPat
[5:31:45] <%SlowLikeThunder> you even get good at-level gear for doing it
[5:31:48] <%SlowLikeThunder> it's bonkers
[5:31:52] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat You mean that one that gives you the xp boosting ring?
[5:31:52] <%Valdorick> If you told me Elmo was toxic, I'd believe it
[5:31:52] <+lucaflow> Yeah no on does that
[5:31:52] <%damienlunas> You don't need regen when everyone's at full HP.
[5:31:53] <%Shady_Squid> I mean, that AOE circle pattern is a bit intense
[5:31:54] <ExpressNode> Mad Pat is best Pat
[5:31:56] <%spiritofmojave> hey Pat and Paige :o
[5:32:00] <NotSoAccurateNo1> it's worth completing those lvl 15 tuts tho because the gear awards helped a ton
[5:32:08] <InugamiTheHound> just LPers and streamers ignoring the tutorial is very common.
[5:32:09] <KatabolicRage> I wish people wouldn't use jump potions, they are literally skipping the main draw of the game in some misguided rush to "endgame"
[5:32:10] <%Shady_Squid> No excuse tho
[5:32:18] <%xemnahort> @damienlunas considering how much they were dying I think they did need it
[5:32:21] <baronvonkame> storm is THE BEST THO!?
[5:32:24] <haitakaa> there's a storm in muh bluud
[5:32:24] <@JustinianKnight> Stormblood is good too
[5:32:24] <%Doruben> im gonna pay to not play the game
[5:32:28] <%MoraMiarty> theyre skipping fucking heavesward
[5:32:28] <+valkuma> i wasnt doing another 200 hours of MSQ to catch up honestly
[5:32:32] <%MoraMiarty> thats a crime
[5:32:34] <corrosivePaladin> Basically dont buy jump potions because pat doesnt want to deal with you
[5:32:39] <%spiritofmojave> I see a lot of WAR jumpers for some reason
[5:32:40] <haitakaa> Stormcum
[5:32:40] <+valkuma> but i know how fucking raids and aoe mechanics work LUL
[5:32:41] <%sshen> It's better to level normally because you learn rotations/animations
[5:32:43] <KatabolicRage> The story is good, skipping the story = you won't understand whats going on in the story
[5:32:55] <haitakaa> pretty much
[5:32:58] <%TheCallousKing> What's the point in paying to not play the game?
[5:33:03] <+Solshine11> Jump potions should only be used by alt characters
[5:33:06] <haitakaa> at that point just watch it on Youtube
[5:33:07] <%MoraMiarty> some people like to raid
[5:33:09] <KatabolicRage> these people are gonna meet emet and go "I've never seen this man before"
[5:33:11] <InugamiTheHound> so its a typical ubisoft micro-transaction from AC games
[5:33:12] <%MoraMiarty> and raid only
[5:33:14] <%king_wragles> OH, jump like level jump
[5:33:18] <+Dubcrookz> i used it on ARR
[5:33:25] <%Lapinelis> TBF, I have a few people in my fc who skip every cutscene. They're here for trials and nothing else
[5:33:28] <%VantomPayne> CN server even encourage you to jump by giving you a free one on your first sub, that being said that environment is much more hash on bads so more people tend to learn mechanics
[5:33:29] <@JustinianKnight> eh
[5:33:30] <KatabolicRage> FFXIV is not a game to get into for the raiding
[5:33:33] <%MoraMiarty> I didn't say it was a good reason
[5:33:36] <@JustinianKnight> I'd say they're real good tho
[5:33:37] <+lucaflow> I would only say maybe skip ARR cause it's so damn dry
[5:33:37] <+Dubcrookz> more like main story skip
[5:33:40] <%king_wragles> Ya, Blizzard charges you like 25 USD to play the game without actually playing it
[5:33:43] <haitakaa> real men play SWTOR Kappa
[5:33:44] <%king_wragles> it's dumb
[5:33:46] <%Suchawus> Casual Raiding is what theyre going for, so thats pretty good
[5:33:54] <%ryome> If you like to raid, how can you not know the mechanics?
[5:34:02] <%Ranryu692> Some people are just bad at video games
[5:34:07] <+Zxtole> They should have a very detailed required raid tutorial for skip potions
[5:34:11] <+lucaflow> It's really not hard to learn the mechanics
[5:34:20] <%ElenaManetta> I miss big Chonk
[5:34:22] <corrosivePaladin> Does it shoot little crabs?
[5:34:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> C R A B
[5:34:24] <Thenuclearwalrus> Why are you doing dumb side quests in ARR? LUL
[5:34:28] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Dodging AoE is also just a basic of evry MMO
[5:34:29] <Calek> I skip cutscenes but play through the missions so I at least experience the mechanics the entire way
[5:34:29] <dredshift> Crab battle?
[5:34:31] <+lucaflow> It's just "get out of the way" or "stand in this spot maybe with the rest of your group"
[5:34:35] <%ElenaManetta> Whenever big Chonk jumped, it gave me life
[5:34:37] <gigacanuck> why do people who are bad at playing video games bother to go out and play videos?
[5:34:39] <TioXyco> I bet some people just began to play because of NieR raid, bought story skip and Level Potions just so they don't miss on it
[5:34:43] <+lucaflow> They're not hard at all but people still fuck it up somehow
[5:34:44] <gigacanuck> isn't watching TV more their speed?
[5:34:45] <%spiritofmojave> the tsyu fight isn't even that difficult just a lot of knowing how to balance light/dark
[5:34:46] <+GeeWilikers1> why 100% an mmo
[5:34:48] <haitakaa> yeah seriously there should be a mandatory tutorial dungeon if you use a jump potion
[5:34:49] <RamenRiderZ> Just tuned in, Pat had a bad trial run?
[5:34:58] <+lucaflow> Yes
[5:34:59] <+TONYOO101> but we need our mukbangs
[5:34:59] <%ElenaManetta> BOO
[5:35:03] <+lucaflow> All his DPS were trash
[5:35:05] <+GeeWilikers1> yes we are
[5:35:08] <+SuzakuRising> I play XIV first and foremost for the story.. then for all the MMO bits
[5:35:09] <ExpressNode> Let me see the inside of your gums
[5:35:10] <corrosivePaladin> pat is scared the lights will make him shine even more while he eats
[5:35:10] <%ElenaManetta> Sit on your food, eat with your butt
[5:35:11] <TioXyco> eat with us, let's talk
[5:35:13] <RamenRiderZ> oof
[5:35:13] <haitakaa> what's the difference between a mukbang and a bukkake?
[5:35:14] <%Valdorick> He's toxic, and must eat that food angrily
[5:35:14] <%bigboy3d> no muckbang fo us
[5:35:15] <%Doruben> tsukiyomio with 4 dead dps
[5:35:18] <MSN04_Sazabi> Pat didn't have a bad run, but pretty much everyone else sure did
[5:35:22] <%spiritofmojave> Eat and talk with your mouthful
[5:35:28] <%spiritofmojave> like the rude boy you are
[5:35:34] <+Solshine11> We would totally make fun of you tbh
[5:35:36] <%Sirculbs> Depriving us of the food porn so that we wait with baited breath. Smart move.
[5:35:37] <haitakaa> toxic man eats toxic McDonalds Kappa
[5:36:20] <%TheCallousKing> I really want to get into FFXIV, but the thought of being the noob who knows 0 about MMOs terrifies me
[5:36:26] <%ElenaManetta> Man
[5:36:28] <%ElenaManetta> I miss City of Heroes
[5:36:35] <+ninebreaker6> !uptime
[5:36:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 36m.
[5:36:56] <%sshen> You know city of heroes recently got private servers right Elena
[5:37:04] <haitakaa> @TheCallousKing as long as you start from level 1 the game will teach you everything, FFXIV is pretty unique from other MMO's as well
[5:37:13] <%ElenaManetta> I thought those private servers were being withheld from the public
[5:37:15] <haitakaa> it has its own mechanics
[5:37:20] <%ElenaManetta> And it was literally just a group who refused to invite people
[5:37:58] <%sshen> Oh no people flipped their shit and he had to make all the files public, a bunch of places have their own private servers now
[5:38:09] <haitakaa> also you will never be as dumb as the 10 yo's who have never played a FF before LUL
[5:38:19] <%TheCallousKing> @haitakaa That's useful to know. Thanks.
[5:38:31] <%ElenaManetta> Awww shit, that's cool, I'm gonna look that up, TY
[5:39:12] <RamenRiderZ> It doesnt matter if youre new. If youre that person who doesnt admit mistakes then youll have trouble
[5:39:24] <%moondog_> is he going for a 24 hour stream at this point?
[5:41:12] <%TysonPG> @TheCallousKing as someone who knew VERY little about mmos or final fantasy i just got into this like a few weeks ago and have been doing what i think is really good. id suggest watching pats tip thing for FF14 for setting yourself up to get into it
[5:41:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> I would jump back into COH private servers...but I'm kinda scared I'll get sucked back in
[5:41:55] <Arweynn> Stream ends before 10est, cause they’re doing star trek with plague then
[5:42:25] <%sshen> I think most people are on Homecoming as the CoH server
[5:42:34] <%itschickenscratch> when did he say he would be back
[5:42:50] <%TheCallousKing> @tysonpg Sweet! I'll look into eventually, when I'm in the right headspace
[5:44:35] <+FruitlessEndeavor> FFXIV is super duper easy at low levels and tries its best to teach you what you need to know and does a pretty great job of easing you into the more demanding mechanics as you level
[5:44:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bow bow, wicka wicka chicka
[5:45:18] <%TysonPG> yeah i think i first started to get nervous in things at like level 50
[5:45:49] <+TheImmortal70> Note, things at level 50 are still incredibly easy in terms of difficulty, it's just the stuff you have to manage starts increasing steadily
[5:46:11] <+TheImmortal70> So there's really nothing to fear from the game until quite literally the end of the first expansion
[5:46:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> I've been considering getting into the game, too. Though I'm a bit apprehensive at the concept of making (gasp!) friends.
[5:46:28] <%TysonPG> the moment i got the third hand gesture for ninja specifically was when i was like oh lord
[5:46:29] <Thenuclearwalrus> Yeah the amount of mechanics in the first dungeon alone, assumes you have leveled up and played through several boss mechanics before
[5:46:44] <+FruitlessEndeavor> 90% of most bosses/trials is just not standing in the AoE's
[5:47:16] <Thenuclearwalrus> Sure, but its about learning which aoe to not stand in, which aoe to stand in and which aoe to only have 1 person stand in
[5:47:27] <%TheCallousKing> Is there a recommended class for beginners? Or are they all relatively similar to grasp?
[5:47:37] <Thenuclearwalrus> All the starting classes are easy
[5:47:43] <Thenuclearwalrus> Play what looks cool to you
[5:47:53] <%TysonPG> id say choose a dps to start if youve never played an mmo
[5:47:57] <%theMrRoboto> I hear people recommend dragoon as the beginner class
[5:48:22] <%VioletHeart> Honestly all the base-game classes are fine beginner options.
[5:48:31] <%VioletHeart> Especially with the tank changes, Paladin and Warrior are extremely easy to get into.
[5:48:31] <RamenRiderZ> I started as DRG back in ARR
[5:48:35] <%TysonPG> personally i ran ninja up to samurai and now im running that
[5:49:04] <%TysonPG> but the cool thing about FF14 is you dont need a different character for your classes
[5:49:10] <%TysonPG> you can just swap on the fly
[5:49:18] <+ived_> RDM was designed to be easy to learn
[5:49:21] <%TysonPG> so if you dont like your class, just change
[5:49:26] <%LocoCrazy_> LocoCrazy_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! "They're not loot boxes, they're surprise mechanics". That's like saying "It's not pedophilia, it's early access". Too much? Nah, that's funny. Fucked up, but funny.
[5:49:40] <Thenuclearwalrus> @LocoCrazy_ LUL
[5:49:50] <%moondog_> that's a good one my man
[5:49:58] <%TheCallousKing> Ahh, ok awesome.
[5:50:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> You ser, have won five internets for that zinger
[5:50:11] <%TheCallousKing> I'll have a look into it and play around
[5:50:15] <%Ranryu692> jfc rofl
[5:50:16] <+FruitlessEndeavor> In some ways I wish there was a limit to how many jobs you could be, so I could actually have a reason to play another character as a different race
[5:50:16] <%LocoCrazy_> Haha thanks
[5:50:20] <%Bigdrifter210> i started as a PLD but i also played gla in the beta way back
[5:50:22] <+SuzakuRising> "it's not pedophilia, it's beta testing"
[5:50:26] <%spiritofmojave> I left for chili, is he eating or shitting
[5:50:31] <gigacanuck> >it's not pedophilia it's early access
[5:50:38] <Thenuclearwalrus> @TheCallousKing There is the free trial unlimited play of any class in ARR up to level 35
[5:50:40] <gigacanuck> someone needs Jesus
[5:50:54] <CrypticMochi> I swear I saw youtube comment similar to that
[5:50:56] <%LocoCrazy_> I don't need Jesus, Jesus needs me?
[5:51:10] <RamenRiderZ> Its not Jesus its a surprise hippie
[5:51:28] <%moondog_> so I just got back to watching this....where the bald man at?
[5:51:28] <blue6sub6remnant6> !uptime
[5:51:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 51m.
[5:51:48] <%TheCallousKing> @thenuclearwalrus yeah, I just saw that myself. Will give it a go. Thanks
[5:52:53] <DRAGKUDO> It's been 10 years pat
[5:52:54] <%LocoCrazy_> Sure
[5:52:54] <%ElenaManetta> You're gonna get the hiccups from eating so fast
[5:52:56] <%spiritofmojave> howdy
[5:53:02] <%damienlunas> You were gone for like 15 minutes and look at the state chat is in
[5:53:07] <+CalamitousTea> DAMN IT PAT! You got me to buy FF14.
[5:53:09] <@JustinianKnight> I spy a Suds
[5:53:11] <+StrawberryPantsu> 100 bleedin years
[5:53:12] <%trillmagical> wait you have lights in there
[5:53:13] <%TheCallousKing> I was 25, I'm an old man now
[5:53:15] <%trillmagical> what the hell
[5:53:17] <%king_wragles> OW
[5:53:18] <%damienlunas> See the kind of shit we get up to without adult supervision
[5:53:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> ohhh noo
[5:53:20] <%spiritofmojave> since the dark nut
[5:53:28] <fairore> oww
[5:53:31] <%ElenaManetta> Well when you're as tall as the coffee table, I assume that happens a lot
[5:53:35] <%titans_ace_jerid> Fuck I just realised I have to do an all-nighter now.
[5:53:39] <%moondog_> looks better with lights
[5:53:41] <Jeemukun> question by the way, as a fellow canuck, you still palnning on doing the podcast since monday is canada day?
[5:53:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> Flood of Light aesthetic
[5:53:44] <Arweynn> Elmo wash
[5:53:46] <katocrimson> that was a quick meal
[5:53:52] <fairore> hi elmo
[5:53:55] <%LocoCrazy_> Got a nice sheen goin' on there.
[5:53:59] <%king_wragles> Why is the coffee table that tall?
[5:54:01] <+misterbingo> the lights turn the reflections to ultra on pats head
[5:54:01] <%spiritofmojave> give us a photo and someone run calculations
[5:54:04] <Sol_Install> HOLY SHIT
[5:54:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> OH GOD
[5:54:08] <%Valdorick> OOF
[5:54:12] <+Zxtole> That's the best thing I've ever heard
[5:54:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> That porpoise?
[5:54:15] <MasterDecoder> Oh god
[5:54:16] <%joylent_blue> NOOOOOOO
[5:54:17] <MasterDecoder> damn
[5:54:18] <fairore> omg
[5:54:18] <@JustinianKnight> that's a Suds
[5:54:22] <%weissguard> UGH That was good. A REALLY BAD JOKE. But well done.
[5:54:47] <%TysonPG> @TheCallousKing also id suggest making a character on Primal because thats where almost everyone that plays here is on
[5:54:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> !raffle
[5:54:54] <RamenRiderZ> Jeez, its 2AM and some little fucker is driving around with a moped
[5:55:14] <%damienlunas> All my friends are on Aether but Pat is on Primal.
[5:55:18] <%damienlunas> It's a real conundrum
[5:55:27] <%LocoCrazy_> @RamenRiderZ He/she is asking to be closelined at that point.
[5:55:30] <@JustinianKnight> why Goverment names
[5:55:42] <+CalamitousTea> What do you think of the changes to a flat 10k MP for everyone?
[5:55:53] <Sol_Install> JimJimJim! Jim guy the Smart Tank Guy!
[5:55:54] <%Bigdrifter210> is hyperion on the dame world as primal?
[5:55:56] <+FruitlessEndeavor> numbers are hard
[5:56:00] <GeltonZ> Pat is on Primal too?! Man I really lucked out on picking Primal! That's 3 groups so far!
[5:56:09] <%moondog_> I honestly like the lights being on
[5:56:14] <+Zxtole> I like the MP change because it makes balancing numbers in raids much easier in case the healer is undergeared
[5:56:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> You should wear a hat
[5:56:17] <+StrawberryPantsu> I dont think Pat would look good with hair
[5:56:22] <katocrimson> time to start wearing hats pat
[5:56:24] <%TheCallousKing> @tysonpg I'll keep that in mind.
[5:56:27] <missingangle> "Bald! Bald! My eeeeyes!"
[5:56:28] <KatabolicRage> Pat your one of the most graceful balding men I've ever seen, people who try to hide it just make it more obvious
[5:56:32] <%spiritofmojave> someone said the bald look makes you look younger, they're right
[5:56:41] <%moondog_> maybe try dimmable lights and dim them down a touch
[5:56:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wear matching hats with your character
[5:56:44] <+StrawberryPantsu> No I mean a full head of hair @AngriestPat
[5:56:53] <%ElenaManetta> Look on the bright side: At least you can grow a beard and be bald.
[5:56:53] <%damienlunas> Wait, how was Clemps playing on Primal anyway? Isn't he European? Why wasn't he on an EU server?
[5:57:01] <%yeknomlive> you should get a black toupee
[5:57:04] <%rdark_ksu> Thats why i've just shaved my head for last 2ish years
[5:57:06] <%blankwaffle> Omg that pupper
[5:57:16] <%ElenaManetta> Totally hairless is weird. I think everyone needs a little bit of hair on their head or face, somewhere.
[5:57:23] <%NYCrownlessKing> i was fate grinding and i just saw u lol @AngriestPat
[5:57:42] <%LocoCrazy_> I'm bald as hell and hardly 30 myself. Meanwhile this Fabio lookin' asshole at work is 63 with 80s hair band length and fuck you guy
[5:57:43] <%NYCrownlessKing> apatDab
[5:57:52] <Jeemukun> If I ever started losing my hair i'd just say fuck it and shave the whole damn thing off
[5:57:54] <RamenRiderZ> This was a fun one
[5:57:54] <+FruitlessEndeavor> @ElenaManetta Yeah that's what eyebrows are for
[5:58:00] <%MoraMiarty> Super Garn
[5:58:04] <MasterDecoder> @ElenaManetta That's why I've started growing a beard, baby face sucks
[5:58:05] <%MoraMiarty> qarn*
[5:58:06] <DRAGKUDO> getting mad Crash bandicoot vibes from here
[5:58:08] <%Unlimited_> another mayan design, I like it
[5:58:23] <%rdark_ksu> hairline has been receding since 19, it happens
[5:58:27] <%ElenaManetta> There's a moment in Breaking Bad when Walt fully shaves his head and both his son and wife gasp at the sight of him and for some reason that pisses me off. LIKE BITCHES, YOU NEVER SEEN BALD BEFORE
[5:58:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> I got my dad's hair. So I'm gradually going bald but it won't really start till im like 32
[5:58:57] <katocrimson> those old men with long hair and ponytail are genetically blessed
[5:59:25] <KatabolicRage> I have a full head of hair but I can't grow a beard worth a shit
[5:59:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Like my brother, Grandfather (mothers side) and my uncles
[5:59:33] <%spiritofmojave> @doc_ock_rokc I get that. Mom's side of the family has a balding trend and I'm losing hair in the shower constantly
[5:59:38] <%trillmagical> i miss protect, what a busted move
[5:59:47] <%TheCallousKing> what level is Pat?
[5:59:51] <gigacanuck> man with long hair that makes his mother and sisters jealous reporting in Kappa
[5:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[6:00:04] <%Unlimited_> wow
[6:00:07] <%Unlimited_> it really is
[6:00:18] <%LocoCrazy_> If Lara Croft can solo this then you guys shouldn't have a hard time.
[6:00:27] <+FruitlessEndeavor> rock bois requiem
[6:00:44] <%damienlunas> Reminds me of the second stretch of Skalla
[6:00:46] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat desperately holding out hope they add Gria from FFTA2 even though nobody gave a shit about that game but me
[6:00:50] <%Faustgesicht> god i hate qarn. first time i met a dumbfucck tank
[6:01:02] <%spiritofmojave> protect is gone but the ritual of hesitating before going is here forever
[6:01:11] <KatabolicRage> the gear in here is interesting, i grinded out the lancer set
[6:01:25] <%NYCrownlessKing> this is so far, my favorite map in the expansion.
[6:01:31] <%NYCrownlessKing> and i love this dungeon
[6:01:45] <%Remery_> Remery_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[6:01:59] <%NYCrownlessKing> farthest i gotten, but i love Rak'Tika being part bunny village. the music etc
[6:02:03] <$psydaku> anything important happen
[6:02:12] <%Suchawus> 2nd boss is rough on healers
[6:02:13] <%SlowLikeThunder> approaching the level 77 dungeon
[6:02:23] <%SlowLikeThunder> I'm pretty sure tomoprrow's stream is gonna be INSANITY
[6:03:08] <katocrimson> podcast
[6:03:20] <%damienlunas> Ha ha you're canadian
[6:03:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> CanuckCanuck
[6:03:32] <%ElenaManetta> Play with feet
[6:03:34] <%ElenaManetta> Give hands rest
[6:03:35] <%ryome> Pat Mad
[6:03:45] <%ryome> Show feet
[6:03:50] <gigacanuck> did someone call for me
[6:03:53] <%spiritofmojave> Stumb slutz
[6:03:54] <dredshift> Hoe's mad
[6:03:59] <%Faustgesicht> bitch i cann't blow him out if i can't hear you
[6:04:18] <%ryome> From jerkin it
[6:04:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> 1-800-BIGSLUTZ
[6:04:24] <Calek> it took me till like the last 1/4 of this bosses health to understand how it's big slam attack works
[6:04:32] <%damienlunas> so I think Pat should probably turn his camera, right
[6:04:42] <%damienlunas> 'cause it seems like something is coming from the other side of the arena
[6:04:44] <%ElenaManetta> Paige should massage Pat's hands while he's playing
[6:04:47] <+EatinEden> I better see u do hand stretches xqcG
[6:04:57] <+ived_> moon2VERYSCARED
[6:04:57] <%Faustgesicht> this is a pokemon
[6:05:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gotta prevent that carpal tunnel
[6:05:04] <%damienlunas> or is it from the boss?
[6:05:05] <%Doruben> BabyRage
[6:05:06] <Retinolgaming> Do hand stretches they work. FeelsAmazingMan
[6:05:11] <%rdark_ksu> dew it den?
[6:05:41] <%ElenaManetta> I love stream moments where you're crushing on an enemy so hard, they don't even deserve your full attention and you talk about other bullshit while kicking their ass
[6:05:55] <%Kain5707> youre arguing over the good music! BabyRage
[6:05:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bruh. Bruuuuuuuuuh

[6:06:07] <Dementedpenguin> So I just came into stream 5 minutes ago. This is why I keep coming back. Kappa
[6:06:07] <%damienlunas> I'm really confused how that attack hits now.
[6:06:08] <%dave323dave> paige gaslighting pat LUL
[6:06:11] <+sabertoothzombie> Pat's in the right
[6:06:13] <gigacanuck> sundowning already huh
[6:06:16] <%Kain5707> well not the boss music
[6:06:21] <%ryome> Pat’s right
[6:06:24] <CrypticMochi> What is this thicc booty rock monster I’m just seeing now?
[6:06:26] <+Edrem> The statues behind pat shows how it will hit the arena, but he won't turn to see it
[6:06:26] <excedebuster> Did I walk in on a fight kaiaS
[6:06:27] <FriendlyLich> @sabertoothzombie pat's never right
[6:06:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> I really dont care tbh
[6:06:56] <LegendCobra> theyre arguing, people argue
[6:07:04] <%kujofire990> is this pat's first time running this one?
[6:07:04] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL
[6:07:06] <+xGreenflame> Chat always mad
[6:07:07] <%damienlunas> I thought they used that pun already
[6:07:12] <dredshift> Pat's not right, he's starboard
[6:07:13] <%LocoCrazy_> So is Pat the Schrodinger's cat of right/wrong?
[6:07:21] <%spiritofmojave> God the localization is great
[6:07:24] <alrobot2014> are you being assaulted by adobe products?
[6:07:24] <%Doruben> acro meaning above

[6:07:36] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL We know you guys are play fighting
[6:07:37] <bomi1995> seems normal to me
[6:07:39] <Sol_Install> Watch Baba

[6:08:06] <%spiritofmojave> you aren't a overgrown baby?

[6:08:51] <+xGreenflame> Pat has to be a tank in game because he can't be one in real life

[6:08:54] <+valkuma> SKINNED KNEE LUL HOSPITAL LUL

[6:09:29] <%shurtal> Deb-ree?
[6:09:30] <%VanaSkiller> a whole boulder in her knee
[6:09:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige had to fight an Onix single handedly
[6:09:39] <%damienlunas> Pour some Jack Daniels on it and walk it off.
[6:09:39] <+Fynale> pat understand she's from america we're not used to going to the doctor for everything
[6:09:40] <%angelmorphic> LULW
[6:09:41] <Sol_Install> Paige wanted to eat the dirt
[6:09:44] <%ElenaManetta> She did talk to a pharmacist, she DMed Plague on Twitter
[6:09:44] <%kujofire990> you're literally fighting just fighting normal ass animals in this dungeon lol
[6:09:48] <+sabertoothzombie> excuses
[6:09:52] <%Ranryu692> Paige's maladies make me sad
[6:09:54] <Sol_Install> after eating the Bibble

[6:09:54] <deadguyisdead> SHUT THE FUCK UP
[6:09:55] <gigacanuck> those are clearly just alligators, I don't know who the developers think they're fooling
[6:10:04] <%spiritofmojave> Glasa type tops rock type
[6:10:05] <%ryome> Paige lost a LEG!

[6:10:29] <%Kain5707> never shut the fuck up Paige
[6:10:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> If anything, you should UNshut up
[6:10:30] <%kujofire990> you did establish those rules pat
[6:10:32] <%titans_ace_jerid> Today on the misery oylmpics.
[6:10:33] <bomi1995> whos talking
[6:10:36] <%VantomPayne> its different when Paige do it
[6:10:37] <Mythundare> Sounds like she's pregnant
[6:10:38] <Thenuclearwalrus> monkaS
[6:10:40] <+RowenCleric> Paige is a mom?
[6:10:40] <excedebuster> Paige I don’t know what happened kaiaS but okay I believe you
[6:10:41] <%ElenaManetta> Sometimes you see certain enemies and you're like, "You couldn't do better than big crocodile"
[6:10:42] <%rdark_ksu> So if we use reverse psychology we can get these bants 24/7?
[6:10:46] <Thenuclearwalrus> Peach holds too much power monkaS
[6:10:50] <+Carquar> Paige is pregnant?

[6:15:27] <Jeemukun> BATSQUTACH
[6:15:33] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@SlowLikeThunder) (warning)
[6:15:34] <dredshift> Those stalagmites are spoilers
[6:15:34] <DRAGKUDO> what does it spoil?
[6:15:34] <%damienlunas> Is it because I looked at it and I don't understand it
[6:15:36] <Jeemukun> that is more fun to say then it ought to be
[6:15:37] <+valkuma> wait really
[6:15:38] <%spiritofmojave> Batsquatch is the biggest spoiler
[6:15:39] <%kujofire990> can't be spoliers if you don't know what''s going on
[6:15:45] <+EatinEden> I’m still in arr I have no idea what I’m looking at
[6:15:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DRAGKUDO Milk
[6:15:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Don't worry, Pat. The people who actually care about spoilers are playing it already
[6:15:47] <%ElenaManetta> Is it spoilers if you're ABSORBING world building AS IT HAPPENS
[6:15:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Snape snaps evangelion out of existence
[6:15:51] <+FruitlessEndeavor> Only spoilers if you look at it

[6:16:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> aka not here
[6:16:05] <+valkuma> city of dark, bad shadow, shadow vs light, light wins ?
[6:16:05] <Mythundare> It spoils the ancient origin of the batsquatch
[6:16:09] <gigacanuck> I don't understand any of that
[6:16:12] <%LocoCrazy_> It spoils Jesus from an outsiders perspective.
[6:16:20] <%TysonPG> as someone who is not at that point
[6:16:25] <gigacanuck> what are those words
[6:16:28] <%TysonPG> it looks like 2 people dancing

[6:16:41] <NotSoAccurateNo1> I don't go to church to avoid bible spoilers
[6:16:44] <%Roundelay11> Not everything needs to be called spoilers in a current expansion dungeon. It's just lore.
[6:16:44] <Sol_Install> oh sin eating gorillas
[6:16:54] <%weissguard> Gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.
[6:16:58] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> most dungeons dont update to story progression
[6:16:59] <dekkitout> FF14 spoilers to me are like JoJo spoilers back when I didn't watch Jojo "FYM A dude turns into snails?"
[6:17:00] <ExpressNode> Welcome to Yggdrasil, the tree in every video game
[6:17:03] <Thenuclearwalrus> So theres a hunt mark in RakTika called "Harambe"
[6:17:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I walked out of Endgame to avoid Endgame spoilers
[6:17:07] <Jeemukun> oh so this is still shadowlords content then?
[6:17:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> @dekkitout I don't even know what a zodiak IS!
[6:17:20] <%LocoCrazy_> "Group leaves cave and kills albinos with no remorse"

[6:18:21] <+talfurt> Was that guy riding a frog?
[6:18:23] <%damienlunas> I didn't finish stormblood, and that still doesn't feel like a spoiler. At some point in the past, Hydie dunked on Zodie? I kind of assumed she might have done that.
[6:18:24] <%Suchawus> yes
[6:18:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> I don't know how I feel about the way damage is dealt in this game. I personally like to see BIG chunks of health bars get bamf'd.
[6:18:31] <iccehot1> How long have you two been married?
[6:18:39] <$psydaku> wasn't zodiark sealed as a baby because it could warp reality? or is that ff12?

[6:22:52] <$OmegaWeltall> oh right what am i thinking LUL
[6:22:53] <+Felto3> it was formed from a monster orgy that got covered in light
[6:22:56] <%LocoCrazy_> Eros eh? Interesting name, champ.
[6:22:57] <%Valdorick> Taking doggy out for a walk then, eh?
[6:23:08] <%ElenaManetta> Because the branches sprout out from a trunk, but all three heads on a fake animal are implied to be equal!
[6:23:10] <Thenuclearwalrus> You can Arms Length the knockback
[6:23:11] <Jeemukun> I like how it's literally named "Love"
[6:23:18] <%MoraMiarty> WE FAAAAALLLL
[6:23:18] <%Divryne> WE FALL.
[6:23:19] <%ElenaManetta> A head is not sprouting OUT of a head, it's sprouting out from the same area as the main head
[6:23:20] <%weissguard> *woof* Hi doggy

[6:23:44] <Jeemukun> I don't know what this track is but it's great
[6:23:58] <$psydaku> when you beat this thing, would the song played be called a DIRGE OF CERBERUS
[6:24:08] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Jeemukun Its the boss music for ShB dungeons
[6:24:18] <+PlainClothesHero> dirge of eros
[6:24:20] <MasterDecoder> I'd then say it's because of how lines work, you always follow the middle, like a Trident
[6:24:24] <RamenRiderZ> I like how in Crystarium's night theme says stand tall instead of we fall
[6:24:27] <Jeemukun> I'll have to youtube it later or something
[6:24:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Jeemukun Almost all of the Sin Eaters are named after forgiven vices or positive things. The most powerful are virtues
[6:25:18] <Jeemukun> @doc_ock_rokc was Eros a viture? I thought it was "Erotic Love" or something, I forget the greek loves
[6:25:19] <+valkuma> this guy is hell on healers
[6:25:23] <Ozmodyas> Lightwardens seem to all be some kind of love in latin
[6:25:28] <Thenuclearwalrus> All the bosses so far have been amazing this expansion
[6:25:43] <%damienlunas> Dark Missionary Position
[6:25:48] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat this is the Git Gud expansion every single dungeon is fuck you learn mechanics
[6:25:55] <+Felto3> the origin of the name is explained in his tt card
[6:26:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Jeemukun It also means an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself
[6:26:11] <$OmegaWeltall> yea this game needs fuck you mechanics out side of ultimate
[6:26:16] <$OmegaWeltall> im sick of the bads
[6:26:18] <Ozmodyas> Philia was love for friends, Eros is romantic/sexual love
[6:26:24] <Thenuclearwalrus> You can use Arms lenth to prevent being pushed across the platform
[6:26:24] <$OmegaWeltall> ^this
[6:26:36] <bestwaifuritsu> @AngriestPat have you done Innocence yet?
[6:26:41] <+Fynale> yshstola is basically the morganna of this expac she keeps telling me to go to bed
[6:26:45] <Ozmodyas> Guessing we’ll be seeing a Storge and Agape later on
[6:26:48] <$OmegaWeltall> they'll proabbly have a boss called Agape at some point
[6:26:49] <Jeemukun> @doc_ock_rokc also the Greek name of the Roman god Cupid
[6:26:55] <%LocoCrazy_> If you were to take a cerberus out for a walk would you have to put a collar/leash on the middle head or all of them, like a sled dog team?
[6:27:11] <$valriot> It's 79 LUL
[6:27:19] <%theturtlebar> Innocence is 79

[7:15:01] <Jack_Nightshadow> Zenos body snatched a new body.
[7:15:02] <+TheImmortal70> Too horny to die
[7:15:06] <%Lapinelis> I assume 5.5
[7:15:08] <$Afterman_> this seems like a good duo
[7:15:09] <+Risingxiv> I thought the same!
[7:15:10] <%Suchawus> hmm
[7:15:10] <Thenuclearwalrus> Oh hey Zenos
[7:15:10] <$Afterman_> and aww ashit
[7:15:11] <+Masutasodo> Speaking of
[7:15:14] <graemecrackers1> Not Santas balls
[7:15:19] <tragicjohnson84> I bet you feel really tiny in it Pat
[7:15:19] <Hidashi13> hey pat hows your day
[7:15:20] <KatabolicRage> god DAMN I want that centurion armour
[7:15:29] <dekkitout> He looks pretty cool
[7:15:30] <%ovan20> it's almost like it's a dungeon...
[7:15:31] <%weissguard> Darth Katana
[7:15:38] <+solidmclovin> this guy like darth vader right
[7:15:42] <%Alopekis> My frenemy
[7:15:44] <$Afterman_> goddamn zenos
[7:15:45] <%demegodz> Darth Fantasy
[7:15:50] <NotSoAccurateNo1> most of the design feels lazy, but also there's flying mounts so get fucked
[7:15:50] <$Afterman_> this is my kinda dude
[7:15:52] <%SlowLikeThunder> I was really not feeling Zenos for most of Stormblood but like right at the end I came around on him
[7:15:56] <zenith0111> Fucking by fighting
[7:16:01] <AdmiralButtloaf> hes like sephiroth kinda
[7:16:06] <Thenuclearwalrus> 5.x maybe? PogChamp
[7:16:06] <%demegodz> Hey look a location

[7:16:08] <$Afterman_> yo ass goin there
[7:16:10] <%MagickBurritoh> yeyeye
[7:16:10] <%SlowLikeThunder> so the fact that he's still here is nice, even if I have no fucking idea what the fuck the reason could be
[7:16:10] <+TheImmortal70> Because you don't know he's alive, he's going to kill and destroy as much as it takes to get you to figure out he's alive
[7:16:17] <+solidmclovin> is that the Location
[7:16:19] <count_bob> Hey look!
[7:16:25] <count_bob> They left some fruit for you!

[7:18:47] <%EarthenLantern> apatWink apatWink apatWink
[7:18:50] <$Kotokaname> Cheer100 would you reccomend this to new people ?
[7:18:50] <$Afterman_> omg pat is a giant potato

[7:19:06] <%demegodz> mutant potat
[7:19:27] <$Kotokaname> Koto is alright owo)b
[7:19:44] <%Faustgesicht> that shirt looks like something I've seen on every Ul'dah Lalafel
[7:19:44] <+VashyronM> all the NA servers a full. good luck creating a character
[7:19:51] <+VashyronM> are full*
[7:20:25] <$Afterman_> i mean technically isnt buying it before july 2 preodering>
[7:20:29] <Hidashi13> jesus this looks pretty
[7:20:33] <+DrPoxx> I have seen Malboro as the most consistent world open
[7:20:55] <%Faustgesicht> that is a hilarous redunancy.
[7:20:55] <%Suchawus> Nah
[7:20:59] <$Afterman_> yeah i was wondering if it was like that or not
[7:21:06] <%Suchawus> I had to buy the PS4 version last night and it counted as a preorder
[7:21:08] <%TysonPG> I bought it yesterday and it was still considered early
[7:21:12] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat as long as you preorder before official launch on the 3rd you get the preorder stuff
[7:21:12] <%Ne1son> Ne1son subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Almost got the Baby
[7:21:13] <elisascarlet> @AngriestPat how much do you like the msq so far? compared to stormblood and heavensward
[7:21:24] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Fynale It launches on the 2nd
[7:21:32] <%abakkus> its kind of cool that even though servers are still full youre still able to do these fetch quests n stuff without shoving through huge crowds
[7:21:48] <Thenuclearwalrus> Dungeons have been amazing so far
[7:21:51] <%Lapinelis> Stormblood feels like a filler arc now, haha
[7:22:06] <TioXyco> AT Field
[7:22:07] <+Risingxiv> always hexagons
[7:22:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I heard an exceed
[7:22:10] <$KnivesEve> AT field
[7:22:10] <+valkuma> they instance all the quest stuff and you share quest kills
[7:22:11] <%demegodz> Shields at max power!
[7:22:19] <+valkuma> so yeah it doesnt have that WoW problem of quests being mobbed
[7:22:19] <Hidashi13> super barrierga
[7:22:20] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@demegodz) (warning)
[7:22:28] <%shurtal> Ah yes, hexagons, the shape for people that aren't fucking around
[7:22:38] <%demegodz> I'm givin all she's got captain!
[7:22:44] <+valkuma> the gargoyles from dark souls are coming
[7:22:47] <TioXyco> Are those Mass Produced EVAs?
[7:22:49] <%abakkus> @valkuma oh thats rad! and smart. good on u ff team
[7:22:52] <+BubbaRands> Oh Nuu the Deatheaters
[7:23:01] <%Deft_Thought> God damn Autonomous EVAs.
[7:23:16] <fohn_jukerbutt> why are these idiots so short
[7:23:25] <Hidashi13> ^
[7:23:42] <Thenuclearwalrus> Because they are teenagers and Pat is a giant
[7:23:52] <$Kotokaname> spooders
[7:23:59] <Thenuclearwalrus> WutFace Spoder
[7:24:02] <$Kotokaname> or crabs?
[7:24:06] <$Kotokaname> what were those
[7:24:14] <Thenuclearwalrus> Giant Scorpions
[7:24:14] <Sol_Install> it looks like we're losing tbh
[7:24:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> crabs are just sea spiders
[7:24:19] <Hidashi13> was that a fucking polar bear?
[7:24:24] <%sinfulldreaming> That barrier was just a massive Protect
[7:24:31] <elisascarlet> this song is even better after reading the lyrics to the trailer theme on lodestone
[7:24:52] <%extrwi> all the healers gave up protect to give it to the crystal exarch
[7:24:56] <%Valdorick> No, just a normal bear that was all light fucked
[7:25:18] <%Unlimited_> is that pat humming?
[7:25:21] <+Fynale> can't wait for this soundtrack to be on spotify
[7:25:21] <Thenuclearwalrus> Ye
[7:25:33] <elisascarlet> I'm so glad protect is gone, good riddance. Whenever you raise someone and there's a lot of raidwide damage you always want to reapply it
[7:25:39] <$Kotokaname> hey pat thinking of PhantasyStarOnline2 when it comes to NA finally ?
[7:25:40] <%Lapinelis> Oh, any plan to go back to Nyakuza, Pat?
[7:25:49] <%Unlimited_> oh god I thought it was the song this whole time
[7:25:51] <+BubbaRands> YO, how fucked would we be if birds had horns?
[7:25:53] <arkv01> judgment?
[7:25:55] <%Mothman742> Mothman742 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[7:25:56] <arkv01> he said its for him now
[7:26:17] <%THATGUY_789> s when silly stuff happens
[7:26:27] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Is there a punchy class in FF14?
[7:26:31] <Thenuclearwalrus> Yes
[7:26:32] <Thenuclearwalrus> Monk
[7:26:43] <KatabolicRage> they even have a invisible weaponn you can glamour on
[7:26:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought I saw a class named Pugilist
[7:26:51] <KatabolicRage> so your just barefist punching
[7:26:52] <+Edrem> Pug becomes monk at 30
[7:26:56] <Thenuclearwalrus> Pugilist is the base class that becomes Monk
[7:26:57] <%Faustgesicht> Pugilist -> Monk
[7:26:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ah
[7:27:03] <arkv01> mmm yes I do loves me some getting swarmed by pidgeons
[7:27:07] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Wish you could run this as a groupdungeon
[7:27:14] <%Mothman742> Mothman742 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! ah yea 1 month more for our beautiful sub baby to be born! unfortunately it still wont be as precious as EMLO
[7:27:25] <Thenuclearwalrus> I think this is my favorite music track of the expac so far
[7:27:39] <Thenuclearwalrus> Well, for fighting atleast, Rak Tika has the best zone music
[7:27:42] <alrobot2014> isn't that ardbert's axe?
[7:27:46] <graemecrackers1> what you eat today Pat ?
[7:27:48] <alrobot2014> w/o the blood
[7:27:48] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat think you'll finish the story before rtx?
[7:27:51] <DirtyMiser> What's your thoughts on the expansion so far? I'm hitting 79 soon
[7:28:21] <+valkuma> RTX?
[7:28:23] <%Lapinelis> The second end gets real level gatey, don't forget to do roulettes pat :<
[7:28:33] <%Lapinelis> I need 20 mil exp to continue the msq
[7:28:34] <%Lapinelis> :<
[7:28:38] <+valkuma> eww
[7:28:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Rooster Teeth X according to Paige
[7:28:49] <%Lithdoran> @lapinelis time to get grinding
[7:28:53] <+Edrem> just do MSQ roulette, it's giving tens of millions exp
[7:28:56] <thatoneicebear> Hell yeah, pat's a big boy too B)
[7:28:57] <$Yakobro> @Lapinelis main story roulette gives 15mil at 79
[7:29:04] <Thenuclearwalrus> MSQ Roulette gives half a level its great
[7:29:09] <+Capta1n_H3nry> RTX is a convention by Rooster Teeth
[7:29:10] <+valkuma> youre only level 76 sounds like you need to be 77
[7:29:14] <+EvilSoully> @AngriestPat So, how does this compare to previous expansions, in your opinion? As much as you've played anyway
[7:29:19] <Hidashi13> look at that polar bear
[7:29:29] <Thenuclearwalrus> @valkuma He's fine, im 76 and about an hour ahead of him
[7:29:29] <%Lithdoran> angel bear*
[7:29:36] <bestwaifuritsu> wow Yshtola, all that for a star shower?
[7:29:54] <arkv01> thancreds watchign from the shadows
[7:29:58] <arkv01> jerking it to your performance
[7:30:04] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL
[7:30:11] <Hidashi13> this music
[7:30:17] <%Piemen99> can i get a recap of the last 2 hours?
[7:30:44] <NotSoAccurateNo1> kill those regular bears in final fantasy
[7:31:08] <+valkuma> dont they need to wing-cacoon before turning
[7:31:21] <KatabolicRage> those guys appear to be merely dead
[7:31:22] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Every time I see this game I'm tempted to buy it, but then my brain remembers that it doesn't like MMOs because of ArcheAge and Black Desert NotLikeThis
[7:31:39] <KatabolicRage> archeage and black desert are examples of korean mmos aren't they? aka, terrible ones
[7:31:47] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Capta1n_H3nry Well, both of those MMOs suck
[7:31:51] <+valkuma> yeah korean MMOs are baddddd
[7:31:56] <+TheGooseChase> Hello Pat
[7:32:02] <Hidashi13> never buy korean mmos
[7:32:05] <KatabolicRage> they blow all their budget on making the characters pretty in korean mmos, and the rest of it tends to be shit or just pay to win
[7:32:05] <Thenuclearwalrus> ArcheAge had promise, but was killed by greedy Devs
[7:32:11] <%Deft_Thought> FFXIV really seems like an all around dope game but I have a hard time with MMORPGs and staying invested in the grind
[7:32:18] <NotSoAccurateNo1> Ragnarok Online was the shit
[7:32:22] <+TheGooseChase> First time watching your stream dude.
[7:32:23] <graemecrackers1> I hear moths like lamps
[7:32:24] <%king_wragles> TWO
[7:33:11] <Hidashi13> can you suplex the bears?
[7:33:19] <+BubbaRands> All the BEARS
[7:33:19] <%weissguard> Big Pulls for BIGGEST BOIS
[7:33:20] <Belutima> here we go time for the fuckening
[7:33:24] <+VariantX7> they're...queuing up... lol
[7:33:24] <zenith0111> BEARS
[7:33:27] <Thenuclearwalrus> Only Godbert has the power to Suplex
[7:33:31] <%ovan20> D:
[7:33:32] <$Yakobro> ^
[7:33:35] <+Punisher7771> wait is woolie still in nipon?
[7:33:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Deft_Thought Either the story or gameplay will keep you invested. I've only capped level in one MMO and played at least the beginning of 3 or 4
[7:33:47] <%ovan20> apatGib HALP!
[7:34:16] <zenith0111> Oh the boss
[7:34:23] <+BubbaRands> Boss Burd
[7:34:31] <+valkuma> how do i make sure i become one of the Seraphim Sineaters instead of the horrendous monster ones
[7:34:51] <IntenseNerdRage> by not
[7:35:17] <Hidashi13> look at that mp management
[7:35:21] <KatabolicRage> making sure people learn those mechanics aren't they
[7:35:23] <elisascarlet> deploy PogChamp
[7:35:23] <$Yakobro> he did a dmg resist buff
[7:35:26] <%Faustgesicht> I'm loving these Ironic Naming conventions for these enemies
[7:35:34] <+TheImmortal70> A special hero Adloquiem
[7:35:48] <+valkuma> Alisaeis using your Limit break as we speak
[7:36:04] <%king_wragles> how are these names ironic?
[7:36:13] <+VariantX7> time for a spirit bomb
[7:36:16] <TioXyco> she gonna LB5
[7:36:17] <%weissguard> YEAH
[7:36:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what girl is scream
[7:36:33] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Ah, well there's my problem then. After playing AA and BDO, every MMO after that felt..sour I guess. I played the free trial for FF14 twice and was kinda meh about it because my previous experience with MMOs was telling me to skip all the dialogue and run to the next quest marker.
[7:36:44] <KatabolicRage> henry those two mmos are terrible
[7:36:45] <$Dakuu75> WOO
[7:36:51] <StripesUltimateEdition> WAH
[7:36:52] <%weissguard> WOO
[7:36:56] <%RittiFruity> Woop!
[7:36:57] <+lucaflow> WOO
[7:37:07] <%Piemen99> nothing person kid
[7:37:08] <$KnivesEve> you do it
[7:37:16] <$Dakuu75> woah, language~
[7:37:17] <+TheImmortal70> @Capta1n_H3nry That's the worst thing you could do in FF 14. This game really has a good story to offer as you get in
[7:37:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> she swore D:
[7:37:23] <%Faustgesicht> don't die again min
[7:37:24] <Hidashi13> x cut the scorpion
[7:37:24] <$Dakuu75> lol
[7:37:25] <+BubbaRands> She said a swore
[7:37:36] <+valkuma> minfillia PogChamp
[7:37:55] <%VantomPayne> @angriestpat not sure if im crazy, but when im running with Urianger it seems he has a move that just murders the target
[7:38:05] <ancrest_tant> Not the bunny waifu
[7:38:06] <zenith0111> Elmo a little weirdo VoHiYo
[7:38:09] <Tampaoster> elmo's seeing the demon ghosts that inhabit your corner
[7:38:17] <$Dakuu75> DUDE, he got knocked back like 500 feet!
[7:38:23] <+tank8173> Does Elmo see the ghost of Abe Lincoln again?
[7:38:24] <Hidashi13> their eyes are throwing me off
[7:38:26] <%VioletHeart> He did the trailer thing.
[7:38:28] <+valkuma> i cant wait to fight Thancred the Sineater
[7:38:29] <+BubbaRands> Thancred still hasn't hit that yet
[7:38:49] <$Dakuu75> WHERE THE HEAALERS?!
[7:38:50] <%MagickBurritoh> Thankscred
[7:39:02] <twoface1240> anime
[7:39:06] <zenith0111> But im dead tho
[7:39:06] <Calek> what's the point of having a ghost axe if you're not going to use it
[7:39:06] <+valkuma> Tank-red now that hes a gunbreaker
[7:39:08] <HomasxualBatman> For an mmo this has some dope cutscenes
[7:39:18] <Buttku> please just clean your God damn axe
[7:39:20] <+Fynale> shits' dark yo
[7:39:20] <Tampaoster> famous last words
[7:39:24] <+VariantX7> nope.
[7:39:30] <Belutima> that one gaurd, just gave up on life, and walked backwards with no weapons
[7:39:33] <%Valdorick> I mean, having reinforcements doesn't mean you're going to be okay.
