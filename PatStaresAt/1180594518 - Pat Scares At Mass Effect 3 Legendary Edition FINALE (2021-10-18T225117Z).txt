[0:13:18] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 3 in the channel! 
[0:13:18] <%ahomeschooldropout> It makes so little sense that indoctrination is the only way to actually explain shit
[0:13:18] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin gifted a Tier 1 sub to egressanon! 
[0:13:20] <dawarw0lf> I don't think the third act is that bad
[0:13:25] <RoboticRexkek> RoboticRexkek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[0:13:28] <%bob900000> I wonder if mass effect 4 will be good?
[0:13:33] <%hewlettfan96> It all just goes derp in the final hurdle

[0:19:29] <willyfreshness> S-wording for Geif
[0:19:31] <%secret_npc> Yep
[0:19:32] <AlphaRayAllen> Parasocial relationships with dogs?
[0:19:34] <Sp3ctre48> That was the best tweet from the Canada wars the other day
[0:19:38] <%hewlettfan96> @scrumbotime I know the feel, it made even myself ill but it was such a relief
[0:19:42] <%SovPho> ff8 is my favorite and i won't back down
[0:19:45] <%Monkeyweed21> FF8 has PROBLEMS
[0:19:45] <Stipli> Music is really good in FF8
[0:19:46] <@Ranryu692> Triple triad is pretty great
[0:19:52] <%Profmcstevie> Music occurs in a void away from the gameplay
[0:19:52] <theobble> SAVE THE HOT DOGS
[0:19:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Junction is a bad system
[0:19:55] <oda_flobunaga> the Magic system is AWFUL
[0:19:56] <%machshop> FF8 is just all-around really fuckin weird and i love it
[0:19:56] <Stipli> Triple Triad is amazing!!
[0:19:56] <DSD24> FF8 has great music
[0:19:57] <%kyh9> I like the *idea* of the Junction system.  But it's very weird
[0:19:57] <Blank9> the Lunar Cry as a concept is insanely awesome for the setting
[0:19:59] <%bob900000> triple triad
[0:20:01] <Zeif00> I did not enjoy the scaling
[0:20:02] <%Puhff> Yeah Angelo is awesome
[0:20:03] <+DarkShadow124> There is only Triple triad
[0:20:04] <%Logoth_> DOLLET
[0:20:10] <+FutaSnek> *Zangief will remember this *
[0:20:11] <%Treuan> I like how you can break it so easily
[0:20:12] <DSD24> Laguna has good music
[0:20:12] <RyuuAoi> Pat, should I START at FF8? I haven't played anything.
[0:20:14] <%Treuan> Like balance wise
[0:20:18] <%machshop> the fact that you only play as the actual protagonist for about 5% of the game
[0:20:18] <Wolfstriker121> why was ff8 hated again? refresh my memory
[0:20:20] <%skeletonmilk> hi pat I'm about to start Eden Savage raids and I'm scared. Do you have any soothing words?
[0:20:21] <%RealThiele> Squall gets impaled awesome
[0:20:23] <%secret_npc> Some folks people love FF8 to spite FF7, but it's completely subservient to that game
[0:20:23] <%DJFakie> But that one guy on the internet HATED IT
[0:20:23] <thelonechris> "Killing multiple presidents is sick ass!"
[0:20:27] <%kyh9> It does not feel like FF1-7 though.  Doesn't feel like it was made by the same team
[0:20:29] <Stipli> Regnarok was a great cool looking ship
[0:20:29] <+chaumiester> How about everyone was at the same Orphanage, but everyone forgot
[0:20:30] <marvel877> A giant gun fires you into space
[0:20:32] <digaogrunge> GUNBLADES
[0:20:32] <oda_flobunaga> YUP
[0:20:34] <%kyh9> DONT DO IT
[0:20:34] <%hewlettfan96> FFVI is the greatest and ill fight anyone who says otherwise is wrong
[0:20:34] <%Garthunox> Man with the machine gun FUCKING SLAPS!
[0:20:36] <@ssjklyco> How many final fantasies are there where they go to Space?
[0:20:36] <+ALazo> whenever someone talks to me about ff8 I feel like they're on crack
[0:20:37] <%kyh9> DONT LEVEL UP
[0:20:37] <DSD24> Quistis is cool though
[0:20:37] <@tizz86> facts
[0:20:38] <Stipli> Selphie was great though
[0:20:38] <%JamesCorck> Also no furries.
[0:20:41] <%Puhff> now do FF15
[0:20:41] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's one of those skyrim games, it was released 9/9/99
[0:20:42] <Zeif00> I don't remember half the characters in 8
[0:20:46] <%bob900000> yup
[0:20:47] <%JamesCorck> FF8 didn't have any furry party member in it.
[0:20:49] <Tracazoid> The better main character
[0:20:52] <RyuuAoi> So FF8 sucks
[0:20:53] <%Laecerelius> Fix the gameplay and it's fine, basically
[0:20:54] <%kyh9> LAGUNA ROCKS
[0:20:57] <%kyh9> LAGUNA IS SO MUCH FUN
[0:20:58] <@tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to DSD24! They have given 521 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:21:01] <%RealThiele> Man with the machine gun is HOT
[0:21:01] <+DarkShadow124> Hey Pat. I just finished MSQ!
[0:21:02] <OldManDeckardCain> squall's character in a nutshell: "..."
[0:21:04] <%Monkeyweed21> remember when Rinoa and Squall just jump into space and then get saved by a spaceship that was randomly floating by them @PatStaresAt
[0:21:04] <%hewlettfan96> Why though
[0:21:04] <%machshop> Laguna is fuckin awesome
[0:21:05] <%Treuan> Laguna is A++
[0:21:06] <AlphaRayAllen> Quistis being 17 makes me irrationally angry
[0:21:07] <@ssjklyco> Their level is also who ever is in your party at the time
[0:21:07] <%JamesCorck> Laguna's the best character in that game.
[0:21:08] <%JoshManVGH> Those dudes rock!
[0:21:11] <+FutaSnek> Ahhhh the B team is way better
[0:21:12] <+luketrapwalker> The Ragnarok ship is pretty cool
[0:21:14] <Wolfstriker121> ahh laguna
[0:21:16] <rytisone> was it the one where they all forgot they were all friends in the orphanage?
[0:21:16] <@tizz86> pretty much
[0:21:18] <%JamesCorck> But seriously, no furry party members, boo.
[0:21:18] <%kyh9> Squall is like less self-aware Cloud
[0:21:18] <Zeif00> Squall is dead theory was fun
[0:21:25] <%secret_npc> Yeah why tf Quistis so young
[0:21:25] <%JoshManVGH> And the Guardian Force story shit was damn stupid
[0:21:27] <alrobot2014> @AlphaRayAllen SHE'S HWAT??
[0:21:27] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I played FF8 with my sister as my first FF game
[0:21:29] <%DSD24> @tizz86 Oh wow wasn't expecting a gift sub! Thanks man!
[0:21:30] <%Garthunox> and MAN WITH THE MACHINE GUN! ABSOLUTELY! SLAPS!
[0:21:31] <RyuuAoi> It was probably meant to feel like dat doe
[0:21:33] <Blank9> squall is a great character as long as you realize what he's saying out loud vs internal brooding
[0:21:34] <quipquest1> @AlphaRayAllen Wait, isn't she supposed to be a teacher?
[0:21:40] <oda_flobunaga> some say Kos smoe say Kosm
[0:21:41] <theobble> "Your jokes suck." *character never speaks again"
[0:21:42] <%machshop> and then you become the president of future land
[0:21:42] <%GhoulishCripple> FF8 is FF Muppet babies right?
[0:21:46] <dawarw0lf> I sure have played those final fantasys. when that thing happens wow
[0:21:47] <%DSD24> @quipquest1 Yeah she's a Teacher
[0:21:52] <AlphaRayAllen> Yeah, she is, guess what.
[0:21:57] <%hewlettfan96> FF8 is bad af
[0:21:57] <AlphaRayAllen> Doesn't matter
[0:21:58] <Rao2357> In a slightly different timeline, Squall and Rinoa would have been siblings

[0:35:17] <AlphaRayAllen> That's a dub
[0:35:17] <Wolfstriker121> so he was a huge pp head
[0:35:17] <%polothegreatest> DQ is fun, but this sour a little ngl psaSkelmo
[0:35:17] <%cvp5127> its good when bad ppl die
[0:35:18] <$Futurecity10> I mean, Koreans are monsters tbh
[0:35:18] <sapphomet777> fuggem
[0:35:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Nice of him to provide the world with another public toilet

[0:35:20] <%kyh9> And now we can end Dragon Quest!
[0:35:21] <%AncelDeLambert> also he refused to allow other countries to hear his music in the games it was licensed for
[0:35:23] <%MightyDuckShoes> So many great dead ghouls
[0:35:23] <dawarw0lf> I like how this finale stream is the only mass effect stream that was rescheduled earlier then all others and has been started early too
[0:35:24] <%machshop> and i hope dick cheney's next
[0:35:24] <%WhereIsWill> WhereIsWill subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 26 months for basically nothing, as i don't know how I'd make it without amazon prime. Anyways, if you ever wanted a tattoo, what would it be?
[0:35:25] <churropoppa> Oh like the creator of Attack on Titan
[0:35:26] <%kyh9> Finally, DQ can stop
[0:35:26] <%ScrapKingKeita> He sent a letter to Washington Post demanding a retraction on an article about Japanese warcrimes, saying that they never happened and petitioned like 2000 Japanese citizens about it @PatStaresAt
[0:35:27] <%silvery_cricket> its "We didn't do nothing to the koreans but if we did they loved and should thank us"
[0:35:30] <Archmortal> @MelBrooksKA TotalBiscuit was a huge asshole, I danced all over his grave
[0:35:30] <James_Quivers> Worst of all that, he kept good music from the rest of Japan
[0:35:31] <$realm_forge> They really baked the hate in in that era
[0:35:32] <%JamesCorck> Doing it!
[0:35:33] <+Troispoint> Remember how they lied to everybody to start a war lmao
[0:35:34] <rytisone> Kai Leng is waiting with Bury The Light playing in the background
[0:35:38] <godzookylives> Rest In Piss bozo
[0:35:42] <Brandon__Brando> spending money for anti stuff is insane to me
[0:35:46] <SilverFaustX> gen powell also died today, the wmd's guy
[0:35:59] <@commanderclaw> Which fall Paige?
[0:36:01] <%secret_npc> Let's have fun with this finale, Pat
[0:36:04] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah fuck Colin Powell
[0:36:06] <theobble> it took paige a YEAR to finish ds2
[0:36:07] <%silvery_cricket> His last 15 years of music was over produced and he was past his prime orchestrally 20 years ago
[0:36:09] <%muetank> More like bang tali out over the summer!
[0:36:13] <Tracazoid> Now Paige can move onto Final Fantasy IV and the party members she left on the floor
[0:36:14] <%silvery_cricket> costing off his past successes
[0:36:14] <%Daxalog> Citidel is over :(
[0:36:18] <+Sendrak70> While it took Paige ages, she did great. Those last few souls streams were fantastic.
[0:36:22] <+Ell1ot> is this the game with the guy with the special eyes?
[0:36:25] <@PeachSaliva> @theobble but I did it bc I am so strong!!!!
[0:36:26] <%GarbageNirvana> How much does Shepard get paid do you think
[0:36:26] <chhdez> We'll turn into reptiles, commander
[0:36:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Like, beyond all the looting
[0:36:42] <%MightyDuckShoes> I don't know how to feel for Powell though. From what I understand he got super pissed at Bush and claimed he was lied to about the WMDs and walked out to peddle those lies. But might be a lie
[0:36:42] <%silvery_cricket> Thank god Shepard doesn't deny war crimes
[0:36:44] <AlphaRayAllen> Just do it
[0:36:44] <dawarw0lf> BANG TAIL
[0:36:45] <Mattais88> should the government pay for it, seeing as it's thier ship?

[0:42:11] <quipquest1> Lots of people used The Dream Shepard as proof of his brain telling him that "he'll burn" by following the child.
[0:42:13] <@goose_attack_almanac> thats not what you said
[0:42:16] <$mattynezz> "What if we had the Batarians?"

[0:42:34] <%DJFakie> Pat's up to a 10 already yeahhhhhh
[0:42:35] <James_Quivers> But what if what's left is just 1 tho
[0:42:35] <%Rumbutt> what if only the batarians survive Pat

[0:42:37] <+SilverDevilfish> "Stop sulking Shepard, you don't act like this. It's like someone has shittly shoehorned you into mopey attitude that doesn't fit you/"

[0:46:25] <oda_flobunaga> there should be an auto aim mode that just headshots everything for you

[0:53:35] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> all ready did that they dont do things twice
[0:53:35] <%DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt
[0:53:36] <socratetris> that would require... paying employees more money??
[0:53:36] <JetpackMcQuack> PrideShrug good idea
[0:53:37] <Sp3ctre48> Cause they had no money by this point, the game is basically falling apart rn
[0:53:37] <%StoopKid241> probably BECAUSE of Mass Effect 2's Suicide Mission
[0:53:38] <%maenos2> hi Steve blum
[0:53:41] <storm_odst> That is a great question
[0:53:46] <$mattynezz> This is "we ran out of time to deal with Cerberus". Not that Earth is good, but it feels like a climax
[0:53:46] <Wolfstriker121> OMG his eyes o.o
[0:53:47] <goodheartedjake> I think it's just not wanting to repeat what they've done.
[0:53:47] <jorniev> YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS
[0:53:48] <Wolfstriker121> lol
[0:53:48] <Virokwet> it would have been a nice redo
[0:53:48] <jtsoppy137> monkaS
[0:53:48] <%terrible35> shrug
[0:53:49] <chhdez> Just slap a thousand omni-gel in there
[0:53:50] <%Ynkubus_> LUL
[0:53:53] <Hyperfludd> those eyes omg
[0:53:53] <AllenDeadman> YOU FELL INTO A PLANET
[0:53:53] <%ahomeschooldropout> can we talk about how much it still doesn't make sense how Cerberus has the largest standing army even with Horizon
[0:53:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> SPECIAL EYES
[0:53:54] <%dekkitout> Well that explains why Sheps eyes are fucked
[0:53:54] <%redthebaron> the eyes really make it
[0:53:57] <SaltyAzteca> His eyeeeeeesssss
[0:53:57] <%DSD24> He was dead by that Point
[0:53:58] <%BubbaRands> I got better
[0:53:58] <AllenDeadman> THE FUCK YOU MEAN
[0:53:58] <$realm_forge> We can’t rebuild Shepard without making his eyes hilarious
[0:54:00] <MrATheGreat> HE WAS GOO
[0:54:00] <Tracazoid> To be fair he was dead for the landing
[0:54:02] <%DrTomT18> I don't think he was aware of that
[0:54:02] <Mattais88> atmospheric reentry
[0:54:03] <%MightyDuckShoes> where is this even coming from
[0:54:03] <Azmodem> Ship of Theseus type shit
[0:54:04] <@Ranryu692> you were *dead* Shepard. Not near-death; dead
[0:54:05] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Tali: "Are you alright?" Shephard: O.O
[0:54:05] <%sniffy77> shepard should of been a puddle
[0:54:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt THE FIRST THING JACOB TOLD HIM WAS THAT HE WAS NOTHING BUT MEAT AND TUBES
[0:54:10] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the WORST time for this plot thread
[0:54:11] <Wolfstriker121> his eyes look like he seen alot of shit lol
[0:54:11] <%ahomeschooldropout> BRO YOU JUST FOUGHT YOUR CLONE
[0:54:12] <quipquest1> What is this turn?
[0:54:13] <%dalmek> why did it take so long for you to think about this?
[0:54:13] <%AncelDeLambert> why HERE
[0:54:15] <@Ranryu692> those fucking eyes LUL
[0:54:15] <zerointelligence000> or maybe you're a clone... oh wait
[0:54:15] <%Eilocke> maybe you are, shep
[0:54:16] <mesamus> those eyes really kill the drama
[0:54:17] <AllenDeadman> oop
[0:54:17] <%DXLelouch24> MINE
[0:54:17] <+Tredecian> hes so upset
[0:54:18] <%Mr_Pylon> WHO CARES ABOUT THIS NOW
[0:54:18] <%secret_npc> This would have set up the Clone being the rival really well
[0:54:19] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> THAT'S HOT
[0:54:19] <ctk96> why would it? it's literally a speed bump to the final stretch
[0:54:19] <%AncelDeLambert> why fucking at the END of the third game?
[0:54:20] <Azmodem> Tali pegs shepherd ,clearly
[0:54:21] <%maenos2> aww
[0:54:21] <pmtriox> way to ruin the last great emotional moment in the game
[0:54:22] <Blank9> this is the first time he has thought about it
[0:54:23] <PassVGC> is Shepard okay he looks like he hasn't been sober In a decade
[0:54:23] <$sleepystardewfarmer> what's wrong with his eye??
[0:54:23] <%greasypete00> <3 tali
[0:54:23] <%YakumoYomi> O.O
[0:54:25] <AluxStreams> Miranda would have said if you were a VI.
[0:54:25] <%VictorVonLouche> You are robo property Shepard
[0:54:27] <+TheotherKristian> Your eyelashes are clipping through your eyeballs
[0:54:28] <+xcompleasedad> @ahomeschooldropout I think they are running out of people at this point. Like, hundreds left. I think.
[0:54:29] <%the_glizzy_wizzy> That dick feels real
[0:54:29] <AlphaRayAllen> It gets better
[0:54:30] <SaltyAzteca> IM AS REAL AS MY SPECIAL EYES
[0:54:30] <Cal_ixo> OMG the eyes!
[0:54:31] <+Armadelus> Pat has sad eyes.
[0:54:31] <OldManDeckardCain> tali: You are real, I can tell by your eyes
[0:54:31] <+Tredecian> his eyes are full of emotion
[0:54:31] <BigFingerRo> WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR EYES, SHEPPARD?
[0:54:32] <unit24> this conversation is coming so so late
[0:54:33] <Mattais88> just like the ibternet
[0:54:33] <+JJJKopf> quick through in some random emotional trauma!
[0:54:37] <%chance_h> John Halo can space jump, so can commander Shepard
[0:54:38] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis : The Stream
[0:54:38] <alrobot2014> boy it would be a good topic go go into if we had more time
[0:54:39] <%TheBigMak> I'm new here. How does your Commander Shepard have Special Eyes?
[0:54:40] <+Aeogard> game is great until the last 5-10% lmaoo
[0:54:40] <$realm_forge> That dick was real enough for tali
[0:54:45] <%HaroldDonchee> wow lol
[0:54:46] <ape_hawk> see kids? always wear your helmet
[0:54:46] <intestinal_bleeding> I do like the slowed down illusive man theme though
[0:54:48] <+titansloth93> HAVE OYU HEARD OF THE SHIP OF THESEUS
[0:54:48] <AlphaRayAllen> HAHA
[0:54:48] <quipquest1> Member Akuze
[0:54:50] <%DashXero> Wear your helmets, kids.
[0:54:51] <socratetris> These eyes are if Rare made Mass Effect instead
[0:54:53] <%DSD24> Shepards a Vanguard
[0:54:56] <Wolfstriker121> SHEPARD I SEE YOU ASSUMED CONTROL with your eyes
[0:54:57] <natzo89> The eyes are implants
[0:55:00] <dawarw0lf> you fought a clone not days ago
[0:55:01] <SilverFaustX> wtf is wrong with his eyes
[0:55:02] <%bravebravesrobin> Going on your previous comment on the Dragon's Quest guy who supported Imperial Japan, it reminded me about the controversies surrounding the Yasukuni Shrine.  Is it really almost exclusively a shrine to war dead that were war criminals, or is it more there are a few there who were and it's more guilt by association? Cheer500
[0:55:07] <SaltyAzteca> They couldnt SEEEEEEEEE it coming
[0:55:07] <@QueequegTheater> >8|
[0:55:08] <AllenDeadman> absurd
[0:55:09] <+krispen_wa> THANKS TALI
[0:55:09] <$SGrim> Mega space helmet
[0:55:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nah
[0:55:10] <+Sendrak70> It was a real good helmet
[0:55:10] <$mattynezz> Space Helmet
[0:55:10] <%Mr_Pylon> You know, this is a great time to just chill and watch videos
[0:55:10] <Parapattern> DUMB
[0:55:11] <%BinaryFireball> his....eyes
[0:55:11] <AluxStreams> That's a hell of a helmet.
[0:55:12] <Archmortal> they're good helmets, Pat
[0:55:12] <%DrTomT18> TOASTY
[0:55:13] <Visorak6> optimistic at best
[0:55:13] <mikesapartment> it's a space helmet!
[0:55:13] <chhdez> OMNI-GEL
[0:55:13] <%dalmek> it was a REALLY GOOD helmet
[0:55:14] <@Ranryu692> it's a good helmet, Pat
[0:55:15] <kingra> Weirdly yeah
[0:55:15] <%HaroldDonchee> it was a good fucking helmet
[0:55:16] <ohno778> jesus...
[0:55:17] <JetpackMcQuack> YOU WERE DUST
[0:55:17] <+xcompleasedad> Football concussions? What are those???
[0:55:18] <+Tredecian> well space tech
[0:55:18] <%maenos2> MASS EFFECT FIELDS
[0:55:18] <Dunmarkh> It was a really good helmet
[0:55:18] <%Caped_Eggy> Wear your helmets kids
[0:55:19] <James_Quivers> But what if Cerberus just replicated his personality? I get what he's thinking about.
[0:55:19] <%Monkeyweed21> """""intact"""""
[0:55:20] <%TheBigMak> DID NONE OF YOU MOFOS RECOGNIZE THE SPECIAL EHES!?
[0:55:20] <%Rafferty3231> why those eyes
[0:55:22] <%Rafferty3231> why
[0:55:23] <%BinaryFireball> what did I miss, why are his eyes ....eyes
[0:55:23] <%sporeian94> IT WAS A LOW GRAVITY PLANET
[0:55:23] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[0:55:24] <roboyuji> Omg
[0:55:25] <+EdHeng> MAGIC HELMET
[0:55:25] <+ItalianWaifu> wouldnt the brain goop just evaporate from heat reentry
[0:55:26] <+JJJKopf> it was a good helmet
[0:55:27] <@QueequegTheater> Less UNbelievable
[0:55:27] <Treasure_Vault> mass effect memory
[0:55:29] <natzo89> wasnt th eplanet without atmosphere?
[0:55:29] <dawarw0lf> mass effect became bad when 2 started
[0:55:32] <$mattynezz> A really good modern Helmet could probably do it
[0:55:32] <theobble> Look with your special eyes
[0:55:33] <dd44dostivei> low gravity planet
[0:55:34] <%twistedj3ster> Why is Pat Scaring at this?
[0:55:34] <%DrTomT18> The Alliance builds it's ARMOR TO LAST
[0:55:35] <pmtriox> this universe's entire premise is defying the laws of physics
[0:55:36] <%Fooguwu> It's almost as if there was some kind of Mass Effect protecting him
[0:55:39] <socratetris> @Rafferty3231 It's ART!
[0:55:42] <%DSD24> We need Pat invested
[0:55:43] <Parapattern> It kept his special eyes from harm
[0:55:45] <quipquest1> The "Robot VI Shepard idea" actually might have made more sense as a twist.
[0:55:47] <%ahomeschooldropout> REMEMBER ONLY 150 OPERATIVES AT THE TIME OF THIS RECORDING
[0:55:50] <$realm_forge> But Pat….sith cultists with unlimited money
[0:55:50] <James_Quivers> I'd tap Kelly Chambers tbh
[0:55:51] <jacobknight13> devils advocate, maybe the planet had low gravity
[0:55:56] <AluxStreams> Literally got you the nicest people on their list.
[0:55:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> What a scumbag
[0:55:59] <%Caped_Eggy> LUL
[0:56:00] <Tracazoid> What they don't want to tell you is they actually got Shepard's DNA from an old colostomy bag
[0:56:00] <%DSD24> Thanks Tali
[0:56:01] <Sp3ctre48> That whole part of ME2 was stupid but can't act like it didn't happen at this point
[0:56:03] <SaltyAzteca> CHAKWAS?
[0:56:04] <%maenos2> LUL
[0:56:04] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:56:04] <AlphaRayAllen> BAMBOOZLED
[0:56:05] <%TheBigMak> holy shit it's like I solved the Da Vinci code by reading how it's a DAN BROWN NOVEL!
[0:56:06] <AllenDeadman> no duh
[0:56:06] <Azmodem> Mind Gamesd
[0:56:06] <oda_flobunaga> When your helmet is made of plot Armor...
[0:56:07] <mutantlunchbox1> gotem
[0:56:07] <willsin4fun> lets pretend by "intact" they mean incased' a nice helmet brain soup
[0:56:07] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[0:56:08] <JetpackMcQuack> >8(
[0:56:10] <dd44dostivei> the illusive man dos not know who those people are
[0:56:10] <%sniffy77> yeah tali
[0:56:10] <James_Quivers> HIS TASTE IN WINE SUCKS, HE NEEDS TO DIE
[0:56:12] <%Mr_Pylon> Oh no the obvious trick was a trick!
[0:56:13] <%Wallabri> the pain in his eyes....
[0:56:13] <intestinal_bleeding> lol
[0:56:14] <%Monkeyweed21> HE ASTROTURFED HIS TERRORIST GROUP
[0:56:17] <willyfreshness> was any of that suppposed to be a revelation???
[0:56:20] <%dekkitout> None of this information is new to Shep.
[0:56:23] <%TheBigMak> It's even the right scene with TALI RIGHT THERE!?
[0:56:24] <%DrTomT18> "We blowing shit up"
[0:56:25] <+Armadelus> Pat Shephard looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger after he got spaced on mars in Total Recall
[0:56:25] <%BubbaRands> SPECKLEDOORFED
[0:56:33] <%greasypete00> boo
[0:56:33] <%SinnerEbru> grr shepard so mayud
[0:56:35] <%VictorVonLouche> Boiler room 2
[0:56:35] <%dekkitout> He was explicitly told all of that
[0:56:37] <$zackalan> what mission is this?
[0:56:38] <%Eilocke> look at this penultimate level
[0:56:41] <%DrTomT18> How do you like that gun, Pat?
[0:56:43] <SaltyAzteca> Thats not even a word and I agree with ya @BubbaRands
[0:56:45] <%Rumbutt> they're dropping turrets, the true final boss
[0:56:45] <+krispen_wa> Why didnt the fleet just...blow this place up?
[0:56:49] <Archmortal> zero other sympathetic cells of Cerberus existed.  The only other one that didn't shoot at us was a horrific monster that abused his brother
[0:56:53] <@QueequegTheater> Doesn't TIM literally tell you he hired Joker & Co to get you invested in 2?
[0:56:54] <James_Quivers> @willyfreshness I don't think it's meant to be a 'revelation' as much as a 'confirmation'
[0:57:01] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[0:57:04] <%maenos2> @krispen_wa they need the thing in there
[0:57:06] <@QueequegTheater> TURRET monkaS
[0:57:10] <quipquest1> What's a matter, Pat? Scard of a little turret even in Baby Mode?
[0:57:20] <%DSD24> Like Gambits in FF12?
[0:57:24] <+krispen_wa> @maenos2 ah shit forgot about the shitty mcguffin
[0:57:31] <+Aeogard> ff12 gambits in Mass Effect Pog
[0:57:36] <%redthebaron> melt people yeah
[0:57:37] <%SinnerEbru> yeah thats a great feeling
[0:57:39] <Zebroneath> Having literally just finished Baldur's Gate 1/2 last week, I know exactly what you mean.
[0:57:41] <Brandon__Brando> Dragon age had that
[0:57:45] <@Ranryu692> Dragon Age had that AI settings
[0:57:46] <Archmortal> devs are terrified of a strong AI party in action games
[0:57:47] <%Caped_Eggy> Ooooh that's hot
[0:57:47] <OvaltineDream> nliRowan
[0:57:49] <%SpcOpsBear> BETTER CONSOLE
[0:57:50] <%Profmcstevie> Smart enough to cleave through the final forces
[0:57:53] <SilverFaustX> so gambits
[0:57:54] <%DSD24> I had that feeling in Pathfinder Wotr
[0:57:54] <+ItalianWaifu> is paiges mic on, there is a small echo sometimes
[0:57:54] <tanarath> It was good
[0:57:55] <%TheBigMak> Wait. Pat is in easy mode? Good! More streamers should do this when showcasing a game if it's not directly linked to skill!
[0:57:56] <%AncelDeLambert> oh yeah the cyborg area
[0:57:57] <%BubbaRands> Sounds like a good time Kappa
[0:57:58] <%maenos2> SHOVE LORE ASAP
[0:57:58] <Mattais88> yeah Dragon Age was great with those
[0:58:00] <$Futurecity10> Pathfinder doesnt have that
[0:58:01] <%DrTomT18> Dragon Age was basically Baulders Age 3
[0:58:04] <@Ranryu692> I liked Dragon Age II. There, I said it
[0:58:05] <Pt_Kamen> "Go for the Eyes BOO, go for the EYES!"
[0:58:06] <+ItalianWaifu> or is it just me
[0:58:10] <@QueequegTheater> @TheBigMak No, he's doing it out of spite
[0:58:10] <RetributionP> gambit were a good time
[0:58:12] <%DrTomT18> Origins was anyway
[0:58:12] <$mattynezz> Dragon Age also made super weak variants of enemies for the final area. They only had like 10% health
[0:58:14] <+xcompleasedad> I forgot about this
[0:58:18] <%AncelDeLambert> how do the cyborg units do? Seeing as Crusade mode doesn't fucking function
[0:58:19] <dawarw0lf> I like this logs
[0:58:20] <James_Quivers> BABY EDI
[0:58:21] <%sporeian94> IT WAS EDI ALL ALONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[0:58:24] <+rafaelba93> this is cheap af
[0:58:24] <%DSD24> Origins was rad as fuck
[0:58:25] <Azmodem> DAI was fun, it let me ride a big buff guy. 10/10
[0:58:27] <+krispen_wa> good ol eddie
[0:58:28] <%HaroldDonchee> man I don't remember fucking any of this
[0:58:30] <AllenDeadman> huh
[0:58:30] <+xcompleasedad> The whole, she's Sovereign bit
[0:58:31] <SaltyAzteca> OH MAH GAH ITS YOU
[0:58:31] <ape_hawk> BUM BUM BUUUUUUUUUUUM
[0:58:33] <%DXLelouch24> EDI was the rogue AI you fought to advance your Class
[0:58:33] <%YakumoYomi> @Pt_Kamen RAAAAAASK!
[0:58:33] <dawarw0lf> this is a cool twist
[0:58:34] <%MightyDuckShoes> the moon?
[0:58:34] <alrobot2014> @Ranryu692 da2 was my first bioware game and i loved it
[0:58:34] <%bravebravesrobin> is that HKs voice?
[0:58:37] <%AncelDeLambert> jesus CHRIST Wrath of the Righteous is a terrible game that I can't stop playing
[0:58:37] <+toastybites> THE MOON
[0:58:38] <%DashXero> That sounds highly suspect.
[0:58:39] <Brandon__Brando> oh thats cool
[0:58:45] <%cooldude69xx> @Pt_Kamen shun
[0:58:48] <%twistedj3ster> understandable
[0:58:49] <tanarath> BRAND
[0:58:49] <%Varlinator> She was the most important side mission in ME1
[0:58:50] <%TheBigMak> @queequegtheater Well that went without saying. I just think it's a good idea of games you wanna share a narrative with.
[0:58:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you THINK?
[0:58:52] <+Aeogard> sus
[0:58:52] <%secret_npc> MASS EFFECT 3 IS A GREAT PLACE TO START
[0:58:57] <Sp3ctre48> I'm sure it's fine
[0:59:00] <natzo89> so are the geth
[0:59:01] <+krispen_wa> EDI IS THE FINAL BOSS OF ENDWALKER
[0:59:02] <James_Quivers> Yeah, better choose that Destroy ending jsut in case
[0:59:03] <SaltyAzteca> So EDI and Legion can technically bang
[0:59:03] <dawarw0lf> so are the geth
[0:59:04] <%DSD24> @AncelDeLambert I just beat it and I want to go back to Kingmaker to beat that one
[0:59:07] <%SinnerEbru> ehh its nbd
[0:59:10] <%cooldude69xx> @Pt_Kamen wrong person, wanted to talk smack to Dragon Age 2 apologist
[0:59:10] <Wolfstriker121> well damn
[0:59:12] <Parapattern> Hmm...almost like...a synthesis...
[0:59:14] <quipquest1> Don't even know what they're talking about
[0:59:15] <@QueequegTheater> MASS EFFECT IS A GREAT PLACE TO START, THEY SAID
[0:59:16] <%DSD24> Boys in the lab
[0:59:19] <Mattais88> murder ai + murder ai = peace?
[0:59:23] <dawarw0lf> its pretty important for the decision later
[0:59:23] <+toastybites> Illusive Man being an ass once again
[0:59:25] <%redthebaron> ellusive man doing his robot racism
[0:59:27] <%bravebravesrobin> that's SO HKs VC right?
[0:59:29] <AngryAsian5> It's that sexy voice LUL
[0:59:32] <Archmortal> "reaper tech" is such nonsense.  How do they distinguish between programming that uses it as a basis and programming made by reapers
[0:59:32] <%maenos2> lol
[0:59:32] <+titansloth93> well ya see Boss, the boys in the lab kinda wanna bang the VI
[0:59:33] <%chance_h> AI + Reaper Tech = waifu
[0:59:34] <+JJJKopf> look he calls AI it omg so evil
[0:59:35] <pmtriox> and FUCK HIS BONES APART
[0:59:37] <%TheBigMak> So. Is Persona 3 necessary to play Persona 4 and 5?
[0:59:37] <%HaroldDonchee> lol that'll never happen
[0:59:41] <SaltyAzteca> @QueequegTheater IT WOULD BE IMMERSIVE THEY SAID
[0:59:48] <willyfreshness> cyberussy
[0:59:51] <AlphaRayAllen> He didn't know you could slap boobs on it, dumbass
[0:59:51] <%DrTomT18> Traner would
[0:59:54] <@Ranryu692> keep it in your pants, Traynor
[0:59:54] <codizle> Those fucking eyes
[0:59:54] <+krispen_wa> no p3 isnt
[0:59:55] <%Ynkubus_> The ai will use the power of horny
[0:59:56] <James_Quivers> TRAYNOR WOULDA DONE IT
[0:59:57] <%Monkeyweed21> TAYNOR WOULD HAVE
[1:00:03] <%maenos2> HE UNSHACKLED YOU BECAUSE HE WOULD DIE 9THERWISE

[1:00:12] <AngryAsian5> PORN
[1:00:14] <@QueequegTheater> @TheBigMak No, the Persona games are actual different stories.  Starting at ME3 would be like starting Game of Thrones in Season 8
[1:00:14] <AllenDeadman> OMG
[1:00:15] <%Treuan> Hell yeah EDI

[1:04:53] <Sp3ctre48> THIS IS A CHOICE THAT MATTERED
[1:04:53] <+xcompleasedad> This isn't the end
[1:04:54] <%DJFakie> psaHoldon
[1:04:55] <%Fooguwu> Pat this isn''t the end of the game
[1:04:57] <%akscully> SUIT UP
[1:04:57] <James_Quivers> This is the IFF equivalent, NOT the finale
[1:04:59] <%DSD24> Why we blew this up
[1:04:59] <%Profmcstevie> Yeah, with grav booting
[1:05:00] <%RealThiele> Climax deez nuts get readin
[1:05:01] <dawarw0lf> but so was illos

[1:05:02] <+cermo55> This if pre-finale
[1:05:02] <%maenos2> OH MY GOOOOOOD
[1:05:02] <%Saadi90> There was no time
[1:05:02] <+xcompleasedad> We keep saying this
[1:05:03] <@QueequegTheater> Even Horizon Zero Dawn's climax did a better version of note-reading
[1:05:04] <+krispen_wa> This is the Ilos
[1:05:05] <+SilverDevilfish> Did Pat forget about the Reapers...
[1:05:05] <+FoolsArcade> this  isn't the finale
[1:05:05] <CairoCopper007> the game knew most would stop here, they didn't bother
[1:05:05] <quipquest1> There's still Earth, Pat
[1:05:06] <%terry_irvin> I memba BibleThump
[1:05:06] <Sp3ctre48> I haaaaaaaate this
[1:05:08] <%afronooch> GOTTA DUMP THE LORE SOMEWHERE NO TIME TO PLAN
[1:05:09] <+Aeogard> nah this is like IFF
[1:05:10] <SilverFaustX> FAMILY
[1:05:10] <$mattynezz> This isn't the finale
[1:05:11] <Parapattern> Turned into Goo
[1:05:12] <%Mr_Pylon> That got blown up tho!
[1:05:12] <dawarw0lf> FUCKING HOW
[1:05:13] <Archmortal> imagine if more than two assholes were writing these last scenarios
[1:05:13] <SaltyAzteca> How did they get that???
[1:05:14] <%Aleate> Your choice to blow it up didn't matter :)
[1:05:15] <Mattais88> the hypest tik-toks
[1:05:15] <rytisone> you didn't blow it up good enough
[1:05:16] <PraiseHemra> Pat, theres more after this
[1:05:17] <Cal_ixo> can you believe EA crunched people for this?
[1:05:17] <tanarath> REAPER HEART
[1:05:17] <jtsoppy137> monkaS
[1:05:19] <+krispen_wa> THIS IS DUMB
[1:05:20] <Wolfstriker121> just howwww
[1:05:20] <+LiberatedPhoenix> WHAT. ARE THOSE EYES
[1:05:22] <$hattrick61> this is more like illos than the final mission
[1:05:22] <%Saadi90> Oh jeez
[1:05:22] <dawarw0lf> I STILL DONT GET IT
[1:05:24] <storm_odst> This is not the massive climactic thing
[1:05:25] <ToneBacas> no eyelids
[1:05:25] <Treasure_Vault> Is the Citadel DLC the first planet of Outer Worlds for the entire ME series?
[1:05:26] <jacobknight13> omg I forgot about this!
[1:05:27] <SilverFaustX> omg those eyes
[1:05:27] <%TheBigMak> how do you sacrifice the galaxy in the name of Galactus?
[1:05:29] <James_Quivers> You never saw that, tbf
[1:05:30] <nuane> god shep looks like donkey lkong
[1:05:30] <Reveresao> SHUT UP PAT
[1:05:31] <+krispen_wa> NO SHUT UP THO
[1:05:32] <SilverFaustX> why
[1:05:32] <SaltyAzteca> WE BLEW IT UP TEN WAYS TO SUNDAY LUL
[1:05:32] <AlphaRayAllen> So was Shepard, pat
[1:05:33] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> No sHuT Up
[1:05:33] <%Piemono> It got better
[1:05:33] <%RealThiele> nuh uhhh
[1:05:34] <%Mekhet09> OH god can we please get different eyes?
[1:05:36] <%DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt this isnt the Finale, the actual finale is much better imo
[1:05:37] <%ahomeschooldropout> HOW
[1:05:37] <pmtriox> you have no idea how stupid this all is
[1:05:37] <+cermo55> It was tougher than the base I guess
[1:05:38] <+Sendrak70> It was ADAMized Pat, totally different. its name is now Adam.
[1:05:38] <@QueequegTheater> I SHOVED A NUKE INTO ITS EYE SOCKET
[1:05:39] <%TheJaydedFox> TheJaydedFox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:05:39] <+Ches_Neckbeard> look he figured out his own tech to get defeat the gravity and time dialation of a super massive black hole SHUT UP
[1:05:40] <tanarath> @liberatedphoenix HIS BRAND
[1:05:41] <Wolfstriker121> DONT THINK ABOUT IT PAT!
[1:05:42] <+TrevSmith222> You can fight Jack and Legion here if you fuck up hard enough.
[1:05:42] <Brandon__Brando> no it wasn't its right there
[1:05:42] <+toastybites> Has Pat done Sanctuary yet
[1:05:43] <%Mr_Pylon> this is stupid
[1:05:44] <%SinnerEbru> WE'RE REUSING THIS BOSS??
[1:05:45] <scrumbotime> you blew it up, only for them to STILL be able to harvest THE HEART???
[1:05:45] <%Faustgesicht> Nah it fell into the safe spot
[1:05:46] <Sp3ctre48> So yeah they just have this shit regardless of whether you blew up the Collector base so I wonder why they even bothered
[1:05:47] <+krispen_wa> GOD ME3'S ENDGAME SUCKS DICK
[1:05:48] <%shurtal> Pat, this isn't the Citadel from ME1, this is Ilos, this games assault the Citadel is still coming
[1:05:48] <morow1ec> I HAVE SPECIAL EYES
[1:05:48] <%sporeian94> Also fun fact if you never save jack at grissom academy she is one of the phantoms coming up
[1:05:49] <%Varlinator> Shut up, it's fine
[1:05:50] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Dont think
[1:05:51] <%sniffy77> That thing has got to be indoctrinating everything aroudn it
[1:05:51] <%Bt_Robot> HOW?!!
[1:05:52] <Cal_ixo> Is this bad writing or Crunch?
[1:05:52] <%Fooguwu> This is where you fight Jack if she gets got
[1:05:53] <@QueequegTheater> @toastybites yes this is the Cerberus base
[1:05:54] <pap_pip> this feels like it should have been in the mid point of the game
[1:05:56] <%JoshManVGH> Where did TIM get another IFF!? @patstaresat
[1:05:57] <%DrTomT18> It's like the guy who made Kai Lang was so in love with the concept of a cyborg ninja rival that he forgot to write the rest of the character
[1:05:58] <thebalticguy1> If you sold legion you fight him here
[1:05:58] <%DSD24> Oh yeah Legion is here if you sold him to Cerberus
[1:05:59] <willyfreshness> YOUR CHOICES DON'T MATTER PAT
[1:06:00] <%YakumoYomi> So did you, Pat.
[1:06:00] <%Varlinator> SHUT UP IT's FINE
[1:06:00] <+LiberatedPhoenix> myyy braaaannnd
[1:06:00] <Treasure_Vault> They used the unatomizer, duh
[1:06:02] <%Mekhet09> DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:06:03] <%VictorVonLouche> Don't worry it gets worse
[1:06:03] <+Grave_Titan_D> special eyes
[1:06:06] <Minorou> Legion would be here too
[1:06:08] <dawarw0lf> CHOICES MATTER
[1:06:08] <%ElkRiverDog> It would make more sense to have the one from Tuchonka
[1:06:10] <@Ranryu692> @Cal_ixo either. both
[1:06:10] <Archmortal> Is the human reaper surviving a nuke more or less believable than ANY of Shepard's body being intact after re-entry
[1:06:11] <%Varlinator> Legion too
[1:06:13] <@Spydurman> they hid it in the Whussy
[1:06:15] <pmtriox> you have no idea how bad
[1:06:15] <%RealThiele> Somehow, Palpatine returned
[1:06:16] <+toastybites> @QueequegTheater thx, my memory of the last parts are hazy
[1:06:20] <Parapattern> It just falls to fucking PIECES
[1:06:22] <oda_flobunaga> How did the Deathstar bits show up in the Rise of Skywalker?
[1:06:24] <pmtriox> you have no idea HOW BAD AT ALL
[1:06:25] <%HaroldDonchee> memmmmberr??
[1:06:27] <Pt_Kamen> BIOWARE MAGIC
[1:06:28] <jtsoppy137> yep
[1:06:30] <Archmortal> Fuck.  Casey.  Hudson.
[1:06:30] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt Jack ISN'T a boss battle. She's a Phantom model with Jack's combat barks.
[1:06:33] <+Aeogard> "how do we wrap this up? fuck you idk"
[1:06:34] <nuane> if they can put sheperd back together, a reaper is no big deal
[1:06:35] <%maenos2> YOUR CHOICE MEANS SHIT
[1:06:36] <SaltyAzteca> NO ONE'S EVER REALLY GONE WutFace
[1:06:38] <%Bt_Robot> DIDN't YOU BASICALLY USE THE COLLECTOR SHIP TO SET OFF A SUPERNOVA AT THE END OF ME2?!!
[1:06:38] <James_Quivers> Reapers tend to leave parts even when they get blowed up real big, like with Dis
[1:06:39] <%VictorVonLouche> IN DARK SPACE
[1:06:39] <%DSD24> This song is still good
[1:06:40] <Wolfstriker121> this is pain lol
[1:06:41] <Sp3ctre48> This totally feels like a "we didn't have time to show a different outcome to your choice" moment
[1:06:42] <%cooldude69xx> We probably wouldnt make a big deal out of this heart working if the base didnt explode quite so hard
[1:06:42] <%DrTomT18> Don't worry about it
[1:06:43] <pmtriox> this is not even beginning the touch how stupid this is yet
[1:06:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt YOU SHOVED A NUKE DOWN HIS EYE SOCKET
[1:06:46] <%BigCoffee> Wasn't the exploded base in a colapsed star?
[1:06:46] <ToneBacas> callbacks mean choices matter. so deep
[1:06:46] <AluxStreams> Making two different choice-dependent environments is hard.
[1:06:48] <JetpackMcQuack> thas crazy
[1:06:48] <+krispen_wa> YOU SHOULD HAVE STOPPED AT CITADEL PAT
[1:06:50] <$mattynezz> I mean, it's made from Reaper metal, and a big explosion doesn't atomize metal
[1:06:50] <dawarw0lf> it only makes since with the emp ending
[1:06:51] <%VictorVonLouche> Didn't you break that mass effect too
[1:06:52] <unit24> hey look it's the suicide mission combat music for some reason!
[1:06:55] <%SinnerEbru> this series has a wild taste when played back to back to back lmao
[1:06:56] <Cal_ixo> What is happening????? What is that?????
[1:06:57] <+FutaSnek> thevir16SUSSY <- the devs
[1:07:00] <rytisone> it makes more sense if you not blow it up, BUT WHY WOULDN'T YOU
[1:07:02] <jacobknight13> in the middle of the galactic core
[1:07:10] <%JoshManVGH> Where the FUCK would Cerberus have gotten another IFF though!?
[1:07:10] <AlphaRayAllen> You'll wish you did
[1:07:12] <%cooldude69xx> How did they get to this?
[1:07:13] <Minorou> we deserve a big rant for the podcast
[1:07:13] <SaltyAzteca> @krispen_wa NO WE GO ALL THE WAY. ROAD TO HELL BAYBEEEE
[1:07:15] <+krispen_wa> BUT COWARDING OUT IS YOUR MOTTO
[1:07:16] <kingra> We are going to see Marauder shields <3
[1:07:16] <+TrevSmith222> That would be pretty funny, actually.
[1:07:16] <%alphonseisbest> DEW OT THO
[1:07:17] <chainsaw105> its a piece of the base
[1:07:18] <%sporeian94> It's the reaper "\brain"
[1:07:18] <mesamus> yeah
[1:07:18] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA LETS EAT THIS PLATE OF SHIT
[1:07:18] <quipquest1> Yes
[1:07:19] <%RealThiele> whussy out then
[1:07:20] <+cermo55> same
[1:07:21] <%Varlinator> But Pat, you're already on pussy-baby mode
[1:07:22] <Kivros> it's the head
[1:07:22] <jacobknight13> no
[1:07:22] <%JamesCorck> Same thing.
[1:07:22] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Same
[1:07:22] <%the_glizzy_wizzy> why? the devs did
[1:07:22] <%TheBigMak> The art of AAA development is to hide the seams in the dress, not correct the crossed stitching.
[1:07:23] <James_Quivers> It's much more intact if you didn't
[1:07:23] <dawarw0lf> plus he HAS to end a certain edgy
[1:07:23] <mesamus> its differnet
[1:07:23] <$mattynezz> It's the Head if you don't blow it up
[1:07:23] <%Aleate> Same thing
[1:07:23] <%maenos2> it's got the head
[1:07:24] <pmtriox> it would have the head
[1:07:25] <%alphonseisbest> YUP
[1:07:25] <Eger007> ye
[1:07:27] <thebalticguy1> same
[1:07:27] <%alphonseisbest> SAME
[1:07:28] <Treasure_Vault> How many hours did you spend on Judgement?
[1:07:28] <%HaroldDonchee> itd be the same. cmon
[1:07:28] <Sp3ctre48> I think it's bigger?
[1:07:29] <Azmodem> PAT "NOT A PUSSY" BOIVIN
[1:07:29] <Virokwet> finish it
[1:07:29] <Archmortal> look all I'm saying is official dev stance is headcanon the ending, and Citadel is therefor canonically post-ending
[1:07:29] <%Monkeyweed21> 12 months so its the same
[1:07:29] <%DrTomT18> It's the head
[1:07:30] <quipquest1> It's a head insted
[1:07:30] <oda_flobunaga> identical
[1:07:30] <Blank9> it'd be the brain instead of the heart
[1:07:32] <%lilytastic> you'd get a different war asset worth like 10 points more
[1:07:32] <+GenoJack28> it's the same
[1:07:33] <dawarw0lf> no its face
[1:07:35] <+cermo55> head is there
[1:07:35] <JetpackMcQuack> they just didn't try huh
[1:07:36] <natzo89> Slighly different text
[1:07:41] <KeystoneA2> You get its "brain"
[1:07:44] <Azmodem> Shiggy Miggy
[1:07:46] <Cal_ixo> I thought we were fighting the reapers?
[1:07:49] <Kivros> it gives 10 more points
[1:07:50] <%Mr_Pylon> blowing up the base popped off its pez head
[1:07:51] <%RealThiele> only the base was atomized very specific
[1:07:51] <%sporeian94> Cyberpunk 2077 is a testament to that
[1:07:52] <nuane> I think he said it once
[1:07:53] <%VictorVonLouche> 100%
[1:07:53] <tanarath> @patstaresat the brain used as the central supercomputer
[1:07:54] <dawarw0lf> BUT CYBERPUNK
[1:07:54] <%Fooguwu> "videogames were a mistake"
[1:07:55] <+Ches_Neckbeard> that base literally falling into a super massive black hole
[1:07:55] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> reapers are tough - Nanomachines son!
[1:07:57] <+cermo55> yup
[1:08:00] <%DSD24> Tuchanka
[1:08:01] <$mattynezz> It was
[1:08:02] <%greasypete00> he really said that i was there
[1:08:03] <KeystoneA2> Also you should put on that new helmet you got, it makes Shepard look like such an asshole
[1:08:05] <SilverFaustX> elden ring got delayed
[1:08:05] <%SinnerEbru> yeah
[1:08:05] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt they kept this like this because consider the alternative location?
[1:08:06] <%sporeian94> PAT GO BACK!!!!
[1:08:07] <%DashXero> Didn't apply to DNF.
[1:08:08] <%DrTomT18> And Tuchinka
[1:08:11] <%AncelDeLambert> and the Quarians
[1:08:12] <dawarw0lf> CYBERPUNK PROVES IT WRONG
[1:08:12] <@QueequegTheater> "But fuck you, no delaying Pokemon, rush it out, I have fucking CHECKS TO PAY"
[1:08:14] <%afronooch> You can feel the deadline get closer as you play
[1:08:15] <unit24> ME3 could have been so good! It upsets me!
[1:08:17] <Dunmarkh> @nuane but he was quoted millions more
[1:08:17] <%Monkeyweed21> Rannoch was also good
[1:08:18] <+TrevSmith222> And the combat is really fun.
[1:08:20] <oda_flobunaga> Rannoch?
[1:08:21] <James_Quivers> "Porn games tell you not to cum, but that seems to be the goal, so yes I would call that bad game design" - Shiggy Miyamoto
[1:08:21] <+Aeogard> geth/quarian and genophage stuff is super good
[1:08:22] <%Varlinator> Yeah, you REALLY feel the rushed parts
[1:08:27] <Hemmy99> vannilla game i think quarians and tuchanka are the only true highlights
[1:08:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Quarians and Tuchanka are the only good parts about launch game
[1:08:30] <pmtriox> Pat, you say that, but no amount of time would have fixed this. too much ego was wrapped up in ME3 and Bioware
[1:08:30] <%VictorVonLouche> They should have just retconed the ending and release a true ending DLC for free.
[1:08:31] <%peachy996> Eh Rannoch
[1:08:31] <%SpcOpsBear> NOVEL SHIT
[1:08:32] <%maenos2> eh rannoch is kinda patchy
[1:08:34] <%ahomeschooldropout> cyberpunk got remade like 6 times
[1:08:34] <huskarl_zap> default dancing at the end of ass affect
[1:08:36] <@goose_attack_almanac> I wish I had a Quarian gf
[1:08:37] <Archmortal> It's like all of the narrative BEFORE all the writers were kicked out when the endings were written was good
[1:08:38] <RyuuAoi> Final? For real this time?
[1:08:38] <%maenos2> GRAYSON
[1:08:40] <%DrTomT18> Grayson is from the books
[1:08:40] <SilverFaustX> but legendary !
[1:08:41] <Brandon__Brando> the illusive man shouldn't even be in this game the reapers are a big enough villain
[1:08:42] <%sporeian94> I believe Grayson is a character from the infiltrator mobile game
[1:08:42] <dawarw0lf> this is a good one but feels like a retread of saren
[1:08:47] <James_Quivers> DICK GRAYSON
[1:08:48] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @QueequegTheater  TBF that's Game Freak and The Pokemon Company making sure the games are out in time for the TCG
[1:08:48] <nuane> "i am Baby Bowser's mom"- Shigeru Miyamoto
[1:08:49] <natzo89> the book
[1:08:50] <%Faustgesicht> Book stuff, whoops
[1:08:51] <%maenos2> REMEMBER HIM?  FROM THE BOOKS
[1:08:52] <jacobknight13> everything thesia onward was rushed
[1:08:52] <%DSD24> Here's the dumb Reaper enhancements
[1:08:53] <$hattrick61> boo stuff
[1:08:56] <%RealThiele> his will was weak LUL
[1:08:58] <scrumbotime> IF YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH YOU CAN JUST IGNORE INDOCTRINATION
[1:09:00] <%WeLucklessJacks> Book Stuff
[1:09:00] <dawarw0lf> I wish TIM wasn't Saren 2.0
[1:09:04] <AngryAsian5> OFF THE CHARTS
[1:09:07] <%Eilocke> this mission is less dramatic and meaningful than any of the prior big missions
[1:09:08] <@goose_attack_almanac> ...no they can't
[1:09:12] <storm_odst> Yeah there’s parts you can tell where thought out way on the beginning and then parts you can tell were like “eh fuck it”
[1:09:12] <quipquest1> Can they?
[1:09:19] <@QueequegTheater> @TallGuyWithAHoodie If goddamn Shigeru Miyamoto told them to delay it to ensure a quality product they would listen
[1:09:19] <PraiseHemra> God, these eyes
[1:09:20] <%DSD24> Oh god this is so bad
[1:09:20] <Sp3ctre48> This is for the two people that read the Mass Effect books (I'm one of them)
[1:09:20] <Treasure_Vault> So how about that Tim Rogers Cyberpunk review coming out any minute now
[1:09:20] <%DrTomT18> In the original story, Shepard was suppose to give themselves Reaper Implants
[1:09:24] <+krispen_wa> SUCH A FUCKING DUMBASS
[1:09:26] <%ahomeschooldropout> when did this happen
[1:09:28] <natzo89> EXPOSITION
[1:09:30] <James_Quivers> TIM ALSO HAD A DEADLINE LOL
[1:09:33] <%Mekhet09> NO TIME
[1:09:34] <+Aeogard> illusive man is a Bioware or Blizzard Developer LUL
[1:09:35] <+Troispoint> The mastermind character just turns stupid
[1:09:36] <%AkronymCLT> It's that Cerberus Magic
[1:09:39] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @QueequegTheater  You know what fair enough
[1:09:40] <$realm_forge> Super soldiers….you know…the ones you’ve killed a million of
[1:09:41] <jtsoppy137> worst plan
[1:09:44] <%SinnerEbru> TIM here is whenever bioware had to talk to EA about this game
[1:09:46] <+cermo55> The force but not the reapers
[1:09:46] <%sporeian94> PUT THE REAPER TECH iN MY BRAIN
[1:09:46] <%peachy996> It's funny I'm sure The Illusive Man must work at EA
[1:09:48] <natzo89> JUST PUT THE CHIP IN MY BRAIN, DOCTOR!
[1:09:48] <zerointelligence000> god TIM is such an idiot
[1:09:51] <AlphaRayAllen> This shit makes no sense
[1:09:51] <tanarath> HERE WE GO
[1:09:52] <@QueequegTheater> IF WE JUST REMOVE ALL THE SEX JOKES, WORLD OF WARCRAFT WILL BE SAVED
[1:09:52] <Ravioli_Ronin> what a scrub, that TIM
[1:09:53] <RyuuAoi> Patstaresat is (not) taking a commercial break
[1:09:54] <%Forbidden_Karp> Okay but if you become a monster how are you going to shop at Publix??? Villains never think this through
[1:09:55] <sendart> god hes dumb
[1:09:55] <scrumbotime> "Indoctrinate me"
[1:09:55] <%DSD24> Where is Jana though
[1:09:55] <%Fooguwu> MAKE ME A REAPER JANA
[1:09:56] <%VictorVonLouche> Uh Oh
[1:09:57] <+krispen_wa> OH NO
[1:09:58] <@ssjklyco> Is this going to be what I think it is?
[1:10:00] <%BinaryFireball> humaaaaniity nNEEEDS Your MInd

[1:11:44] <+JonathLP> Those eyes! Those horrible, horrible eyes!
[1:11:44] <%secret_npc> Shepard should have fought the reapers in that chair
[1:11:46] <%cooldude69xx> Shepard sees TIM in space with his special eyes
[1:11:46] <%TheBigMak> Shepard's Special Eyes have a -2 Perception
[1:11:46] <%dekkitout> Looks like Judge Doom
[1:11:47] <@QueequegTheater> >8O "Cerberus is finished"
[1:11:47] <quipquest1> "I SAW EVERYTHING"
[1:11:48] <jorniev> I LOVE HIS ANGRY FAE
[1:11:48] <Brandon__Brando> I love how this place looks why didnt the whole level have a look like this
[1:11:49] <%charp35> The special eyes are really making this scene
[1:11:50] <%Varlinator> The Brand is STRONG with this one
[1:11:50] <%barrakuta371> Pointing guns is his brand
[1:11:51] <%SinnerEbru> special eyes-off
[1:11:53] <+Ardailec> Did he shove that ciggarette up his nose?
[1:11:54] <%ScreamLord> Shepard can see fucking EVERYTHING
[1:11:58] <%AncelDeLambert> this is so dumb, he's so stupid, everyone is so goddamn stupid
[1:12:02] <valiard> Its anime shepard
[1:12:03] <nuane> tell me your plan plz
[1:12:03] <%robotoken> i hate the eyes
[1:12:03] <Sp3ctre48> Actshually Shepard, controlling a husk is basically controlling a Reaper
[1:12:03] <%peachy996> I'm looking at The Illusive Man and seeing his "projects" go to shit. Is The Illusive Man based off of EA CEO Andrew Wilson????
[1:12:07] <%BubbaRands> ooooooooo
[1:12:09] <prime_name> ITS THE INTENT
[1:12:09] <%DSD24> I still love the Illusive Man theme
[1:12:11] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @Ardailec sure looked like it
[1:12:11] <%Aleate> Here we go
[1:12:12] <%DrTomT18> yes
[1:12:17] <+JJJKopf> WHEN HE REVIVED YOU
[1:12:18] <$realm_forge> Mr Shepard head AMGRY EYES
[1:12:20] <%HaroldDonchee> he brought you back to life but ok shepherd
[1:12:22] <%DrTomT18> you literally plugged the devil into your brain
[1:12:23] <jtsoppy137> earth is almost dead
[1:12:26] <RyuuAoi> The eyes, Chico. They never lie.
[1:12:26] <+cermo55> when it mind control, definately
[1:12:29] <alrobot2014> but why would the VI tell TIM if he's indoctrinated?
[1:12:35] <%RealThiele> he just happens to be the one who controls it oh boy
[1:12:35] <%peachy996> Think of the famous Andrew Wilson as Satan picture, He looks like the The Illusive Man minus the eyes
[1:12:38] <%TheBigMak> TheBigMak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Shepard's Special Eyes have a -12 Perception effect while active. So no shit he aims a gun at a hologram.
[1:12:43] <%cooldude69xx> @AncelDeLambert Illusive man at least has the excuse of being crazy
[1:12:43] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[1:12:45] <AluxStreams> The Illusive Man has his own special eyes.
[1:12:45] <@QueequegTheater> O_O hand it over
[1:12:46] <oda_flobunaga> President Bartlett got paid for this
[1:12:46] <+krispen_wa> ITS NOT THAT SIMPLE THO
[1:12:47] <murdocismyhero> Its not simple to fix those eyes

[1:12:56] <prime_name> Man, Martin Sheen still kills it
[1:12:58] <%saiyanblitz> Shepard Special eyes creep me out
[1:12:59] <%Daxalog> Its playing a version of the mision end theme in th ebckground
[1:13:00] <%akscully> gief snoring is great
[1:13:02] <@goose_attack_almanac> How has cerberus helped Humanity. Like at all.
[1:13:02] <%dekkitout> So angy
[1:13:03] <%Mr_Pylon> WHY
[1:13:05] <AlphaRayAllen> I WONDER WHY THAT IS
[1:13:06] <+Troispoint> I hate the writers
[1:13:08] <%Varlinator> He's not wrong u know
[1:13:09] <+SilverDevilfish> And then Shepard takes the spin off Tim but Tim had a gun and was lying
[1:13:12] <%RealThiele> but muh immortality
[1:13:18] <%DSD24> Its a shit idea
[1:13:19] <pmtriox> so colossally stupid
[1:13:21] <%dalmek> no Cerberus is a dog
[1:13:22] <%notsoy> I HAVE A DREAM
[1:13:22] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> TIM: "DESTROY IS CRINGE, CONTROL IS BASED"
[1:13:23] <%Laecerelius> He peepee poopoo'd for the good of humanity
[1:13:25] <+Setsuna_seiei> it's not that simple. BUT IT IS
[1:13:25] <DracaenaLeaf> An IdEa
[1:13:28] <Brandon__Brando> what will he even gain by controlling them?
[1:13:28] <AlphaRayAllen> I HAVE A DREAM
[1:13:30] <%maenos2> ideas are bulletproof
[1:13:31] <+pectusumbra> Look at this guy just opening his mouth and just wank coming out
[1:13:31] <@QueequegTheater> "What if racism?" WHAT AN IDEA
[1:13:32] <nuane> that idea is space nazis
[1:13:32] <thelonechris> It's a fucking stupid ass idea
[1:13:34] <jorniev> WHY ARE YOU SMOKING AGRESSIVELY AT ME?
[1:13:34] <James_Quivers> That idea is 'Yell at aliens on the internet"
[1:13:34] <tanarath> AN IDEA
[1:13:34] <Sp3ctre48> It literally doesn't matter, TIM is indoctrinated, nothing he says has to make sense and it's so lame
[1:13:35] <%ScreamLord> Bad Ideas tend to stick around, yes
[1:13:36] <%TheBigMak> His Special Eyes have a -12 Perception, that turns +15 when you FIND HIS BRAND!

[1:13:40] <+Troispoint> Illsive Man says don't be an idealist, my ideas the best
[1:13:41] <Cal_ixo> He doesn't care about Earth. He wants to uplift humanity to become Gods
[1:13:41] <%JoshManVGH> Human Supremacy?

[1:14:47] <Archmortal> to be fair the conduit was not the citadel, the conduit was a mini mass-relay
[1:14:47] <James_Quivers> IT'S THE DEATH STAR WOOO
[1:14:48] <%MidnightBurst12> it's gotta eat the citadel
[1:14:48] <%barrakuta371> It was the Citadel all along!
[1:14:49] <dawarw0lf> I never noticed Javik and the ai is the same voice actor
[1:14:49] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[1:14:49] <%afronooch> SO NICE WE TWIST IT TWICE
[1:14:49] <%TheWinged7> oops all old ideas
[1:14:49] <%DSD24> I like it
[1:14:50] <%peachy996> Back to your Apartment!
[1:14:50] <%Mr_Pylon> all roads lead to The Citadel
[1:14:50] <pmtriox> it is 1000x worse than you think
[1:14:53] <%Mekhet09> YEAH.
[1:14:54] <scrumbotime> Plot Twist 2: The same as the first one
[1:14:55] <oda_flobunaga> DEATH STAR 2
[1:14:57] <$realm_forge> THE CATALYST IS THE FRIENDS WE MADE ALONG THE WAY
[1:14:57] <%studleydoorite> explosion dot jpeg in the background LUL
[1:14:57] <%DrTomT18> It all comes back to the Mass Relays, Pat!
[1:14:57] <%maenos2> CONDUIT CATALYST CITADEL
[1:14:58] <%secret_npc> It could only have been the Citadel
[1:14:58] <Sp3ctre48> Idk it's funny but I'm fine with that
[1:14:59] <ctk96> I mean it makes sense why wouldn't it be?
[1:14:59] <MidnightPacif1c> LUL
[1:15:00] <ohno778> DARKNESS
[1:15:02] <%MugenSandan> AGAIN!
[1:15:03] <+krispen_wa> MY BRAND
[1:15:03] <zerointelligence000> yeyeye same shit
[1:15:05] <%TheAdMerlin> Wait, so they bulit the crucible to work on the Citadel, when every cycle starts with losing the Citadel?
[1:15:05] <dawarw0lf> DUMB TWIST BUT NKT THE WORSE YET
[1:15:06] <@QueequegTheater> I actually don't hate it in theory but the execution is bad
[1:15:08] <prime_name> THERES NO TIME
[1:15:10] <ToneBacas> they'll never expect the same twist twice
[1:15:13] <+Ches_Neckbeard> It ends up making sense though. The Reapers built the Citadel to control the Relays and nobody else has the tech to do so
[1:15:13] <+xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt They used the Reapers' bullshit Super-Stargate to fuck them over
[1:15:13] <JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis

[1:15:37] <socratetris> Isn't Asset Reuse great? All stories should be written with Asset Reuse in mind

[1:15:45] <roboyuji> Man, you looking like Homer Simpson makes this better
[1:15:48] <AlphaRayAllen> SNITCH
[1:15:49] <kingra> NICE
[1:15:50] <Sp3ctre48> That is actually weird though cause the Reapers immediately take the Citadel in every cycle except this one for some reason
[1:15:51] <Jmann1892> LUL
[1:15:53] <@goose_attack_almanac> how does the VI know all this

[1:16:26] <KeystoneA2> So yeah everyone in the Citadel is fucking dead or fighting for their lives
[1:16:26] <@goose_attack_almanac> REAPERS WERE ALREADY IN THE SOL SYSTE WHY WOULD YOU GO THERE

[1:16:27] <%RealThiele> EARTH #1
[1:16:28] <@Ranryu692> @Sp3ctre48 because the Protheans made it so that it wouldn't happen in this cycle. that was in ME1

[1:20:44] <dawarw0lf> why I understand the coming twinsies being bad the fact that the citadel was moved off screen is my biggest pet peeve
[1:20:46] <@QueequegTheater> @knight_verse The Citadel is established as a mass relay in 1

[1:21:15] <%DrTomT18> make up your own story about what happen to them!
[1:21:16] <Hemmy99> ALL THOSE PEOPLE YOU SAVED
[1:21:17] <pmtriox> no actually they're all dead, not even kidding

[1:21:24] <Kivros> brain gives 110 points
[1:21:26] <blue8moon> too bad you killed the batarians, then you'd be at 8000 Kappa
[1:21:28] <+Aeogard> LUL
[1:21:28] <$Futurecity10> Would have been 8000 if you saved the batarians
[1:21:30] <socratetris> Asset Reuse~~~~
[1:21:31] <TourettesPlays> Oh cool we're going to meet the best Mass Effect 3 character, motherfuckin MAJOR COATS PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp

[1:21:32] <MrATheGreat> you get 225 if you save iirc
[1:21:35] <James_Quivers> That's the ME2 pic, I beleive
[1:21:35] <+vaderxyz1970> If only you kept the Batarians to be meat shields
[1:21:37] <%maenos2> Omg they didn T change the image
[1:21:44] <%Mekhet09> A shitload more where they don't change situations?
[1:21:45] <+Sendrak70> Is andromeda next on the list?
[1:21:50] <%secret_npc> It's just a reference image from ME2
[1:21:55] <Vantesla> They don't say in game. But devs have said in past majority of still living named characters on Citadel lived. Supposedly hiding and avoiding Reapers...
[1:21:57] <%Forbidden_Karp> isn't that from ME2 that screen?
[1:21:57] <+Aeogard> this does happen a lot, they use me2 icons for a lot of stuff
[1:21:58] <%RealThiele> werent expecting total narc shepard
[1:21:59] <@QueequegTheater> @Sendrak70 lmao no
[1:22:02] <%Eilocke> to be fair, that's an image of it in the collector base
[1:22:02] <Brandon__Brando> but it looks cooler
[1:22:04] <unit24> I thought paragon shep didn't want to use reaper tech!
[1:22:07] <AlphaRayAllen> Cool
[1:22:08] <Sp3ctre48> I like to think they were pretty embarrassed about the Human Reaper so it's only offhandedly brought up here
[1:22:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt that shot is just from ME2
[1:22:09] <%DrTomT18> Or they are just lazy
[1:22:13] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt DAUD THO
[1:22:15] <+Cactuskris> nah they just made one cause they had no time
[1:22:18] <James_Quivers> Oh yeah I can see the pumps you break up top, this is the ME2 pic
[1:22:18] <kingra> Oh LUL
[1:22:20] <%SinnerEbru> LUL
[1:22:23] <rytisone> yeah, let's NOT have an explosive ending
[1:22:24] <%HaroldDonchee> just say it's the only image they have of it
[1:22:25] <%secret_npc> The worst offender is Shepard's cutscene assault rifle
[1:22:26] <prime_name> Gotta save time
[1:22:27] <%WeLucklessJacks> How is this already an asset when you don't have the time to properly retrieve and use it.
[1:22:28] <+krispen_wa> CHAOS
[1:22:30] <bippityjones> LUL
[1:22:32] <%valriot> I mean they dont for any level but eh
[1:22:32] <+Cactuskris> it´s kust not optemized
[1:22:32] <blue8moon> but.... why not just make a second picture?
[1:22:37] <jtsoppy137> CHOAS
[1:22:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The low chaos level also sucks in comparison
[1:22:38] <TheMostAverageGamer4> why are they using the heart. wont they be indoctrinated
[1:22:39] <%UberKingKai> Like in beyond 2 souls
[1:22:40] <Brandon__Brando> why did they even bother
[1:22:44] <+rafaelba93> low chaos is the canon tho
[1:22:44] <RetributionP> oh how was doing goblin without people?
[1:22:45] <%DrTomT18> @blue8moon no its too hard
[1:22:48] <%chance_h> We must kill Chaos
[1:22:50] <%SinnerEbru> dont wake the baby!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:22:50] <ExpressNode> Wish I was half baked
[1:22:51] <%Mekhet09> I hate when they do that. make two different scenarios or just don't bother giving me this bullshit.
[1:22:53] <%RealThiele> b o r k
[1:22:56] <James_Quivers> Guys I'm sad Kai Leng is dead, he was my favorite
[1:22:57] <blue8moon> LUL
[1:22:59] <@QueequegTheater> @TheMostAverageGamer4 it's fine shut up
[1:22:59] <pmtriox> @blue8moon can't...too hard
[1:23:00] <dawarw0lf> How is the entire rest of the reaper only 10 more
[1:23:13] <tanarath> borker is sleep
[1:23:14] <Sp3ctre48> Mass Effect has a lot of these fake choices unfortunately
[1:23:15] <%SinnerEbru> let the boye sleep
[1:23:16] <bippityjones> Wait so did you beat the DisWhussy 1?
[1:23:19] <pmtriox> like you think you've reached the bottom
[1:23:20] <Retinolgaming> I don't think it's that, would you even be able to recognize what it is if it's just a metal bolder sized heart? This lets you remember the thing it's from. There are years between these games.
[1:23:21] <+rafaelba93> low chaos is the cannon Pat
[1:23:22] <MrATheGreat> Developers assuming players will be dicks first is the stupidest thing. It's never true
[1:23:23] <+RyTYoung> I wish they followed up on your ending in the sequel, instead of just going "no this ending is the one you get to continue on from"
[1:23:25] <pmtriox> you haven't even seen the bottom yet
[1:23:28] <%BubbaRands> psaBig SCHLEEP
[1:23:36] <dawarw0lf> I'm very curious on chats reaction on Pat's choice for the ending
[1:23:37] <TheMostAverageGamer4> dont worry i will hahaha @QueequegTheater

[1:24:22] <%greasypete00> there may be a mod for it
[1:24:22] <%JamesCorck> Can you not mod it?
[1:24:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:24:23] <%spitelite> are there any mods
[1:24:23] <+Aeogard> origins is such a good game, would be great.
[1:24:24] <%DXLelouch24> @surely theres a mod by now to fix that?
[1:24:24] <%Mekhet09> Can't you mod that?
[1:24:26] <%DashXero> There might be a mod for that.
[1:24:26] <holyxgrale> there is a mod for text size for dragon age origins I believe
[1:24:26] <Brandon__Brando> that sucks
[1:24:26] <%SinnerEbru> yeah its CRPG text
[1:24:27] <$mattynezz> A mod came out for text size, didn't it? Let me check
[1:24:29] <pmtriox> ....reloads
[1:24:29] <+Cactuskris> just paly 2 :)
[1:24:30] <%MooseIsGoose> yeah the text size stinks on normal computers
[1:24:31] <%secret_npc> Dragon Age Legendary Edition when 😬
[1:24:32] <%cvp5127> aww
[1:24:33] <%MidnightBurst12> awww

[1:24:39] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Fuck yeah Mass effect
[1:24:42] <alrobot2014> the memory leak in Origins is also a pain in the dick when playing for a long time
[1:24:42] <%DSD24> There's nothing in there
[1:24:43] <+krispen_wa> LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT
[1:24:43] <holyxgrale> But dragon age 2 does not have gui scaler mod and it sucks ass
[1:24:44] <%Forbidden_Karp> maybe don't drink before the battle
[1:24:44] <%DrTomT18> @secret_npc Honestly? It could happen.
[1:24:45] <blue8moon> renegade shep is just stupid shep
[1:24:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Worth pointing out that Vanguards don't have omniblades but you just manifest one for that cutscene. They didn't even try to program in a version for biotic classes
[1:24:46] <%DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt surely theres a mod to fix that at this point?
[1:24:46] <@Ranryu692> @secret_npc DALE
[1:24:49] <ToneBacas> what did he do with that glass?
[1:24:49] <+Dives__> There's probably a text size mod
[1:24:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Cyberwarfare Pogchamp
[1:24:51] <dawarw0lf> I like this Clapping moment

[1:25:34] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Its gonna be shit
[1:25:34] <zerointelligence000> we all know it ends in one of 3 colors
[1:25:35] <%Forbidden_Karp> why did they pick that camera angle for Joker
[1:25:35] <thelonechris> Why did that look so stiff?
[1:25:37] <+unhuggable1> oof
[1:25:38] <%alphonseisbest> HOOO RAH
[1:25:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Said Joker

[1:26:01] <@Ranryu692> Yarrr
[1:26:02] <Treasure_Vault> Aren't those game stories a little heavy on the rape as a motivator?
[1:26:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> HHAHAHAHA
[1:26:05] <chainsaw105> you have to activate it manually from the game files
[1:26:05] <scrumbotime> Imagine trying to manage to import a save into inquisition
[1:26:05] <Macguffn> Yo that Ho
[1:26:06] <%Mekhet09> Literally just crack it.
[1:26:07] <%jackelzxaa> Whoever told pat that the other m intro was a metaphor or something was wrong.  It’s not a baby symbolism, its just showing samus’s chozo infusion from the manga
[1:26:08] <MrATheGreat> lmfao fuck ea
[1:26:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Anti Piracy Bs
[1:26:11] <AthenaAegis> There's a gog version of DA Origins
[1:26:11] <%DSD24> I like the Morrigan one!
[1:26:12] <+shapeforn> Im not saying you're wrong, but my Ultimate Edition is like, normal
[1:26:13] <%AkronymCLT> Oh just like ME1 original sick
[1:26:15] <Tracazoid> That's why I never played Mass Effect 3 prior, all the Bioware account stuff and the DLC I just never played it until the Legendary Edition. Same with Shadow Broker and Kasumi's DLC.
[1:26:15] <%secret_npc> just stream the 360 version iunno
[1:26:17] <+CapFlat> I literally forgot who this woman was
[1:26:18] <%MooseIsGoose> The only DLC you need is the Shale DLC
[1:26:18] <Sp3ctre48> I only ever got the Shale dlc for origins
[1:26:19] <%RigmaroleHM> Telltale games wont tell you stats at the end of chapters anymore either
[1:26:19] <ctk96> wow really?
[1:26:20] <Wanhangidyilinya> my 360 died when i tried to do the last mission, and i got a new one, that ALSO died when i tried do last mission... so this will be nice to finally see this though
[1:26:20] <pmtriox> why does bioware social network not exist again? Beacuse they couldn't handle people saying how stupid ME3 is
[1:26:24] <%sunsetdisc0> you gotta play the gog version for the dlc
[1:26:25] <Brandon__Brando> wired I dont remember it but maybe I did it and forgot about it
[1:26:30] <%mai_waifu_> I pirate Ubisoft game I OWN because I was locked outta my Uplay
[1:26:32] <$mattynezz> Just pirate it. That's the actual solution, and I think it's just a single file
[1:26:32] <%jackelzxaa> Is pat finally gonna kill the reapers
[1:26:35] <+vaderxyz1970> Your toothbrush deserves a medal
[1:26:36] <%DSD24> Shale was rad!

[1:26:58] <SaltyAzteca> I REMEMBER THAT
[1:27:06] <rytisone> Dead Space 2 had dlc that didnt release on PC
[1:27:08] <%SinnerEbru> bioware was like im controller agnostic
[1:27:08] <%MooseIsGoose> Does GOG have all the DLC for Dragon age
[1:27:10] <chancho4tierra> you already buy it, just download a version ready to play. dragon age is must play
[1:27:13] <%ScreamLord> THE WHY DO THEY HAVE CONSOLE PORTS ASS HOLE!?

[1:27:18] <chainsaw105> I just completed my first mage run of Origins and I couldn't believe I was able to litter like 30 hotbar slots with all different spells
[1:27:19] <%RigmaroleHM> cool guess I'll use a controller emulator
[1:27:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Earf
[1:27:22] <%OrangeMDT> I feel like the world wouldn't be much different if ME3 ended well, but at least ME3 would've ended well

[1:29:42] <scrumbotime> Imagine if that was a Kai Leng email
[1:29:43] <Archmortal> @Ranryu692 Liara is literally the last party member you recruit in ME1 if you don't skip anyone

[1:31:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> SHUT UP IT IS LUL
[1:31:47] <%sporeian94> Mass Effect 3's intro was suppose to have more time on Earth because Shepard was on trial and it was gonna be a whole thing before the reapre invasion
[1:31:47] <%Profmcstevie> Craters all look the same
[1:31:48] <%ScrapKingKeita> "I didnt wanna see Detroit"
[1:31:48] <%peachy996> Piece of garbage
[1:31:48] <nuane> accurate probably

[1:31:53] <Treasure_Vault> Isn't this the same problem with New Star Trek?
[1:31:54] <Tracazoid> Same with Thessia, the homeworld of the Asari is too busy getting destroyed to check it out
[1:31:55] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If I wanted that I'd go to Montreal
[1:31:55] <%TallYoda08> atpCap EA...
[1:31:56] <%RealThiele> CoDVerse
[1:31:56] <%SpcOpsBear> DIALOGUE SKIPPED AGAIN
[1:31:57] <%SinnerEbru> "fuck your level design"

[1:32:01] <%Varlinator> You get 5 mins at the start & 3 hours of rubble at the end
[1:32:01] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck you, Javick
[1:32:02] <Retinolgaming> You start on earth at game 3 start with reapers landing? Albiet briefly
[1:32:04] <%Keaton_x> You mean Detroit?
[1:32:04] <+vaderxyz1970> I wanted to go to Future Indiana
[1:32:05] <%JamesCorck> Well, too bad!
[1:32:05] <bippityjones> it is TIM-
[1:32:08] <oda_flobunaga> Well hold on toy your but
[1:32:09] <Brandon__Brando> that was a wired fade out
[1:32:09] <TheShockVox> Tekken not realizing why we loved Moonlit wilderness in Tekken 5
[1:32:11] <%twistedj3ster> Pat you say that like it won't look like that in the future
[1:32:12] <quipquest1> woah, did his dialogue glitch?
[1:32:13] <heartlesshealer> [Brown is real]
[1:32:13] <%cade_calrayn> oh snap Queequeg
[1:32:13] <%JamesCorck> You get charred burnt out battle zone.
[1:32:14] <%DrTomT18> Did you tell Javik to read the Shard?
[1:32:15] <%MugenSandan> Reminds me of Garlemald BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:32:16] <pmtriox> "back in my day we blah de blee blee me stupid 4 eyed alien man"
[1:32:18] <Hemmy99> this last mission sums up the worst parts of 7th gen tbh
[1:32:18] <Sp3ctre48> You never even get to go to the Turian homeworld lol
[1:32:19] <%DrTomT18> I missed that
[1:32:19] <Griffin2210> But you're going to london so it's accurate
[1:32:20] <rytisone> show us earth star trek academy
[1:32:20] <$hattrick61> dont worry, this burned out shithole is BLUE
[1:32:21] <%RealThiele> but WAR tho
[1:32:22] <%Varlinator> Why wouldn't it be?
[1:32:22] <KingSpunf> 7th Gen can get fucked bro
[1:32:23] <%JamesCorck> Because they ran out of time!
[1:32:26] <AlphaRayAllen> Ok bro
[1:32:30] <Virokwet> fair
[1:32:32] <@goose_attack_almanac> You get two versions of Earth. Call of Duty map, or two buildings, a hallway and some air vents
[1:32:32] <dawarw0lf> @dxlelouch24 but he's not part Reaper tech I think that's the writers reason. yes it contradicts other parts of the destroy ending but that can be said for all the endings
[1:32:33] <%shootbang_exe> this game is very undercooked, it shows how rushed development was
[1:32:33] <+BeardedLuchador> Wait is that Adam Jensen
[1:32:34] <TourettesPlays> "reskin" its asari architecture shut up
[1:32:34] <Treasure_Vault> Don't you want Star Trek to be about giant space fights and yelling?
[1:32:34] <Alzero83> Pet your Robo Doggo, you heathen
[1:32:36] <%AkronymCLT> I think the only reason they chose london was so they could have that trailer with the guy in Big Ben
[1:32:36] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt I hate how the game makes the reapers just come super fast even when it's like unrealistic.
[1:32:37] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Garlemald FeelsBadMan
[1:32:37] <%chance_h> “I’m in the space future, why da fuck do I want to go to Detroit?”
[1:32:38] <zerointelligence000> hopefully they fix that for 4
[1:32:39] <$mattynezz> Palaven was cut content
[1:32:40] <+hatok> but there's a big epic war with huge SCALE
[1:32:41] <+Dives__> Agreed
[1:32:42] <%ScrapKingKeita> yeah but it has DARK SOULS
[1:32:43] <dd44dostivei> new gun for sale
[1:32:44] <%Varlinator> But BIOSHOCK tho
[1:32:44] <alrobot2014> Palaven is just a burning rock in the sky
[1:32:46] <%alphonseisbest> YES IT DID
[1:32:46] <%Logoth_> What gen are we even on now? I stopped counting
[1:32:46] <+Cactuskris> eh.. it had rapture
[1:32:47] <arizenarkana> No matter how Mass Effect 4 turns out, at least it will probably LOOK good.
[1:32:47] <pmtriox> you got to not really see Thessia either
[1:32:48] <%WeLucklessJacks> You got new armor!
[1:32:49] <Alzero83> Pet your Robo Doggo, you heathen @PatStaresAt
[1:32:49] <$mattynezz> 7th Gen was the Turret Section Generation
[1:32:50] <natzo89> Palaven is inhospitable to humans, no?
[1:32:50] <%Monkeyweed21> at least we got to see Surkesh
[1:32:51] <quipquest1> It had Arkham City though
[1:32:52] <+sonofthedeepsouth> It sure did
[1:32:55] <+JJJKopf> remember how EA wanted this game to come out in 2011
[1:32:55] <scrumbotime> oh god its gonna show all of the upgrades
[1:32:56] <ctk96> did he skip javiks lines just now??

[1:35:52] <scrumbotime> Absolutely, you'll win and every other planet will be trashed already

[1:35:59] <%jackelzxaa> Theyre pulling out the vanguard of alot of planets
[1:36:02] <AngryAsian5> I guess so. But the idea is that the Catalyst will kill all the Reapers, so this is the "final stand"
[1:36:04] <dawarw0lf> that s why Shepard why talking with tail about it
[1:36:05] <Parapattern> The dumbest thing about the ending controversy is idiots who thought every one was complaining because it was a "sad ending"
[1:36:05] <sendart> We will hold the line?
[1:36:06] <rytisone> we're in the endgame now
[1:36:06] <Hemmy99> i never got what made earth the end goal

[1:36:29] <blue8moon> The location of the final battle should've been the Vorcha Homeworld
[1:36:30] <Sp3ctre48> You'd think if literally every Reaper moved to earth that it would be time to retake all the occupied planets while they're gathering at earth
[1:36:31] <thelonechris> Oi bruv

[1:47:15] <%TheAdMerlin> He can die there
[1:47:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they only had one line read for him dying
[1:47:16] <Chaos_Aether> He can die there
[1:47:16] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt THATS JUST THE START LUL
[1:47:16] <Rao2357> your boyfriend's in trouble
[1:47:16] <GamerWorlock> EEEEEEEEBBB
[1:47:16] <alrobot2014> that's a bug that they made sure to leave in
[1:47:16] <Brandon__Brando> This game is falling apart
[1:47:17] <%willjar313> "STEEEEEEVE oh wait you're fine? Okay..."
[1:47:17] <%maenos2> it uses the romsnxed Steve voice line
[1:47:17] <%afronooch> steve can die there,
[1:47:18] <%JamesCorck> Wait what, what happened?
[1:47:18] <PunchSlugfest> they messed up the voicelines
[1:47:18] <%shootbang_exe> I don't know if pat is ready for how dumb this is all about to be'
[1:47:18] <%jackelzxaa> Thats where steve can die pat
[1:47:18] <%secret_npc> The game did the "does he die?" check
[1:47:19] <NewWillinium> STEEVE!
[1:47:19] <Botman_R> He dies there if you don't do his sidequests.
[1:47:19] <thebalticguy1> he can die there
[1:47:20] <%JoshManVGH> Ya. Oh ok then
[1:47:20] <linSP> MIIIIIKE moment
[1:47:21] <$mattynezz> It makes more sense if you're buggering him. Also he dies there if you ignore him
[1:47:22] <%BigCoffee> what mixmatch
[1:47:22] <AngryAsian5> STEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVE
[1:47:23] <Sp3ctre48> @PatStaresAt after this you HAVE to look up how your human saquadmates react to Cortez dying, it's so funny
[1:47:23] <James_Quivers> STEVE
[1:47:24] <Ghufufin> true romance revealed
[1:47:24] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They assumed you would romance him
[1:47:25] <%RedSqurrl> STEEEEEVEEEEEEEE
[1:47:25] <%jackelzxaa> He can explode
[1:47:26] <PunchSlugfest> the lines got switcehd
[1:47:26] <%MugenSandan> STEEEEEEEVE
[1:47:26] <jacobknight13> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa

[1:47:27] <%StoopKid241> STEVE
[1:47:27] <%strakillias> He can die there lol. Its even worse if you are romancing him
[1:47:28] <+Grave_Titan_D> STEVE!
[1:47:28] <Archmortal> they expect you to not do Multiplayer and Steve dies
[1:47:28] <alrobot2014> I think Mark Mee even talked about it in an interview
[1:47:29] <Macguffn> Strap in Pat, its the ME3 ending from here on out!!!!
[1:47:30] <chainsaw105> Shepard yelling STEEEVE is because the dialogue is bugged as if you romanced him
[1:47:30] <%shurtal> they didn't record multiple steeves, so you got romance steeve
[1:47:31] <PunchSlugfest> and they never fixed it
[1:47:31] <%ScreamLord> So why did everyone switch to Thermal Clips again? The Lancer seems to blow everything apart
[1:47:32] <+JJJKopf> NO TIME GOTTA PUSH
[1:47:33] <%HaroldDonchee> JASOON
[1:47:33] <+SmigGames> They used the take where Shepard romanced Steve
[1:47:34] <%mai_waifu_> you sure :v
[1:47:34] <PanicSwytch> Bye steve
[1:47:34] <$realm_forge> ERMIGAD STERRRV!
[1:47:34] <$hattrick61> "STEEEVEEE!" "I'm okay" "oh cool"
[1:47:35] <+Cactuskris> acting baby#
[1:47:35] <%Varlinator> It's the default even if you don't romance him
[1:47:35] <+ItalianWaifu> he was worried
[1:47:36] <%DashXero> I looked away for a second. What happened to Steve?
[1:47:36] <%Bt_Robot> A rEaPeR DrAGoN?
[1:47:36] <%sporeian94> Dude if he dies the screams from your teammates are hilarious
[1:47:37] <Hemmy99> its so bad
[1:47:37] <olm46> Jason!
[1:47:37] <%secret_npc> Cause the check passed
[1:47:38] <Parapattern> That didn't even sound like him
[1:47:38] <Wolfstriker121> WHAT?!
[1:47:39] <%Profmcstevie> YOU GOOD?! Ah you good
[1:47:39] <%redthebaron> SHEP CARES MORE ABOUT STEVE THAN TALI

[1:47:40] <tanarath> Big Rushed
[1:47:40] <+FoolsArcade> cause he love steve
[1:47:40] <%afronooch> not enough time for 2 reads for multiple outcomes
[1:47:40] <%Faustgesicht> Because Rushed?
[1:47:41] <natzo89> mix and match dialogue
[1:47:41] <AllenDeadman> they just slapped lines together
[1:47:42] <dawarw0lf> oh God chat is going fast
[1:47:42] <+BeardedLuchador> I'm as dead as Steve is
[1:47:43] <jacobknight13> for the emotions pat
[1:47:43] <%BubbaRands> STEEEEEVE....y'alrigh
[1:47:43] <%Aleate> MMF THAT SCREEN SHAKE
[1:47:43] <choocheess> okay now put the equalization on the steve scream to 100
[1:47:43] <Mattais88> BEAUCES YOU GOT DRUNK AND WATCH SPACE BASKETBALL
[1:47:44] <karl_rex> Its all downhill from here
[1:47:44] <%maenos2> it bugs to the Steve romanced line
[1:47:44] <pmtriox> this entire sequence is so awful
[1:47:45] <chancho4tierra> STEEEEEEEEEEEEVE
[1:47:46] <jbrachob> no time to record a second line
[1:47:49] <pap_pip> "STEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" "i am good" "kk, got you"
[1:47:49] <%sporeian94> REMEBER THE CAIN!!!!!!

[1:47:54] <Brandon__Brando> thank god your on baby mode
[1:47:54] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[1:47:54] <Goraka91> It's immersive, allegedly
[1:47:54] <James_Quivers> They didn't expect anyone to care about Steve, very sad
[1:47:55] <SilverFaustX> SHAKE
[1:47:56] <willyfreshness> DEFEAT THE LENSLFAIRE
[1:47:57] <thebalticguy1> CAIN
[1:47:57] <%peachy996> The screen shake is less intense but still present on Tuchanka (Night) in MP and I still hate
[1:47:58] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> NUKE LAUNCHER
[1:48:01] <+krispen_wa> VIBRATION IS THE ULTIMATE REAPER TECH
[1:48:02] <PunchSlugfest> eh kinda
[1:48:03] <+unhuggable1> holy fuck that screenm shake
[1:48:04] <%Daxalog> Gotta make the Cod money
[1:48:05] <%VictorVonLouche> basically
[1:48:07] <+Cactuskris> mw2 is so muc better though
[1:48:07] <%NopeBadguy> RAMIREZ

[1:48:12] <SaltyAzteca> MY BABY
[1:48:12] <d3ltuhhh> man that scene was actually cool this is just uh....
[1:48:12] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you kill Samara in 2, Morinth shows up here as a Banshee
[1:48:12] <IntrepidEye> GET TO WHISKY HOTEL
[1:48:12] <chainsaw105> NOOOOO
[1:48:13] <%Puhff> Dude, Steve rules! I'd freak out too
[1:48:14] <%MightyDuckShoes> that used to be a meme I remember on YouTube.
[1:48:15] <%NopeBadguy> RAMIREZ DEFEND THE BURGER TOWN
[1:48:15] <LoneFonte> danisaurHypeG what the fuck is this screenshake danisaurHypeG
[1:48:16] <jtsoppy137> ....
[1:48:17] <PunchSlugfest> SHEPHARD, DEFEND BURGERTOWN
[1:48:17] <Treasure_Vault> Is there suppose to be music?
[1:48:17] <%peachy996> Tuchanka Night is the worst MP map because of the night and screen shake
[1:48:18] <%Wallabri> boom
[1:48:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> That mission was cool
[1:48:19] <%dekkitout> ...
[1:48:19] <%HaroldDonchee> I think it would sound fine if we just heard shepherd yell more than never
[1:48:20] <+BeardedLuchador> oh lol
[1:48:23] <%afronooch> If you look at the skybox close enough, you can see the deadline
[1:48:23] <%MidnightBurst12> that's a little specific but i see it
[1:48:24] <AngryAsian5> Honestly, this final level is my least favorite part to play through. I always baby-mode through this shit. LUL
[1:48:24] <choocheess> they probably used the same STEVE for the romance as for the nonromance which explains its loudness
[1:48:24] <Brandon__Brando> this is so lame
[1:48:24] <%jackelzxaa> I love xbox 360 games
[1:48:25] <SaltyAzteca> THEY NERFED THE BOOM
[1:48:25] <+krispen_wa> LUL LUL LUL
[1:48:25] <+Cactuskris> Ramirez would have killed harbringer by now
[1:48:27] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> again, THAT was pretty cool!
[1:48:28] <%SpcOpsBear> THAT LITTLE "THWOONK" AS IT HITS
[1:48:28] <Archmortal> Just need to shoot the reapers with the CAIN
[1:48:30] <+BeardedLuchador> it looked like it did nothing
[1:48:30] <%RealThiele> nice time delay
[1:48:32] <Goraka91> Why does it normally do that
[1:48:32] <%StoopKid241> Did MW2 come out around the same time as Mass Effect 3? I forget
[1:48:32] <%jackelzxaa> Theyre all the same environment
[1:48:32] <choocheess> that was a cool bit of suspence
[1:48:32] <%Varlinator> WE DEFENDED BURGERTOWN!
[1:48:34] <Make_me_mad> Why aren't you shooting the reapers with THOSE?
[1:48:34] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> shame it's surrounded by TRASH
[1:48:34] <%mai_waifu_> That was pretty cool tho
[1:48:37] <@QueequegTheater> HAMMER TIME
[1:48:37] <%Aleate> Why don't we have like 30 of those and we could just win this war...
[1:48:37] <SaltyAzteca> WHY DID THEY NERF THE BOOM :(
[1:48:38] <%MidnightBurst12> that was kinda cool
[1:48:38] <Sp3ctre48> So you would fight Banshee Morinth here if you saved her
[1:48:40] <%jackelzxaa> You killed a reaper!
[1:48:40] <thelonechris> REEEEE
[1:48:40] <jacobknight13> I hate that, why dont they do that all the fucking time!?
[1:48:40] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt One of the Banshees in this zone would have the name Morinth if she lived in ME2.
[1:48:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Why arent you using those in Space tho?
[1:48:43] <%SpcOpsBear> Current Objective: Survive
[1:48:45] <+krispen_wa> REEEEEEEEEEEEE
[1:48:45] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak!

[1:48:53] <choocheess> she's about to extract your eardrums
[1:48:54] <d3ltuhhh> @stoopkid241 2 or 3 years before
[1:48:57] <ScaryMonstersTV> ***
[1:48:58] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If it was Morinth there would be two.  She's specifically an extra one
[1:49:00] <$lotharrio> Oh, okay. Good, got ot it.
[1:49:01] <blue8moon> Garrus can just solo the reapers
[1:49:02] <+The_Death_Owl> @stoopkid241 ME3 was 2012 so no
[1:49:02] <Hemmy99> hammer is supposed to be your full army and its nothing lol
[1:49:03] <pmtriox> remember the opening of the game?
[1:49:03] <Archmortal> remember to aim garrus for maximum damage
[1:49:08] <TourettesPlays> @Sp3ctre48 Good, Shepard ensures the entire Ardat Yakshi species is wiped out
[1:49:09] <d3ltuhhh> oh hey actual music!
[1:49:09] <%bravebravesrobin> I really hope Hammer teams motto is Hammer Time
[1:49:10] <Ravioli_Ronin> Garrus, come pick me up, I’m scared
[1:49:11] <Sp3ctre48> They play this one song so fucking much in this game
[1:49:13] <AlphaRayAllen> What was the first game to use "current objective: survive"
[1:49:20] <%alphonseisbest> Wait was there no Podcast today?
[1:49:24] <choocheess> garrus is my favorite deathray
[1:49:26] <%SpcOpsBear> @AlphaRayAllen Halo: Reach

[1:49:28] <@QueequegTheater> @AlphaRayAllen Halo Reach
[1:49:28] <%peachy996> There's another Cain around here you wont need
[1:49:29] <%Forbidden_Karp> So much cooler than Kai Leng
[1:49:30] <$mattynezz> There are no pickups here, so don't feel like you have to scrape.
[1:49:31] <RetributionP> this isn't no halo reach
[1:49:33] <%NopeBadguy> Are you still on Narrative difficulty
[1:49:34] <%RealThiele> big narrative boy
[1:49:35] <chainsaw105> its THE best one
[1:49:35] <$dmdyne99> SAVE STEVE
[1:49:37] <%Profmcstevie> Reach is definitely the most famous
[1:49:39] <+Cactuskris> halo reach is sooo good

[1:54:15] <$lotharrio> He's a guy from abook or something?
[1:54:15] <tanarath> @goraka91 The same reason why Kai Pussy Leng exists
[1:54:16] <@Ranryu692> @ChungusQuest not enough
[1:54:18] <%the_glizzy_wizzy> Major coke
[1:54:19] <%peachy996> They never shut the hell up about London
[1:54:19] <%jackelzxaa> Anderson hid behind waisthigh cover to survive for so long
[1:54:20] <Goraka91> He also appears to be voiced by Hawke from DA2

[1:54:23] <%Forbidden_Karp> oh right the trailer....
[1:54:23] <nuane> you might still die

[1:54:27] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt He is the same guy!
[1:54:28] <%secret_npc> That's him
[1:54:28] <@QueequegTheater> That's him
[1:54:28] <alrobot2014> they even showed his trailer in your appartment on the citadel

[1:54:37] <%peachy996> Yeah that was Coates
[1:54:37] <pmtriox> that was the guy
[1:54:41] <%Logoth_> o h  n o
[1:54:41] <%Monkeyweed21> and then he sees Shepard
[1:54:42] <pmtriox> yeah that was him
[1:54:42] <bippityjones> Why the fuck are they "The Resistance"? The Reapers don't control the government they're straight up attacking Earth; they're The Defense
[1:54:42] <%Jeemukun> THAT'S THE GUY BEHIND YOU
[1:54:44] <knight_verse> Anderson durvived on pidt apocalyptic earth for luke a year and a half... what a badass.
[1:54:44] <%secret_npc> oh haha

[1:55:14] <+tomdwarf> My stomach didnt drop. I got hype. I did assume, however, that we would be hanging out on earth before WAR happened.
[1:55:14] <ohno778> tity
[1:55:15] <intestinal_bleeding> Huh?
[1:55:15] <%DrTomT18> I think Major Coats was meant to have a larger role in the story but it was cut.
[1:55:15] <$lotharrio> @PatStaresAt Coats was the trailer-man
[1:55:16] <AlphaRayAllen> Sir?
[1:55:16] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Fun fact, he was in Big Ben shooting any Reapers that he saw and nobody knocked the building over
[1:55:17] <+vaderxyz1970> True Love
[1:55:17] <%Aleate> "Take a look at THIS. Whatta ya think of it??"

[1:55:20] <LightningLynx89> Pat everyone liked the trailer at the time
[1:55:23] <%DXLelouch24> is Paige just topless offscreen?
[1:55:24] <James_Quivers> I LEFT IMMEDIATELY
[1:55:24] <@Ranryu692> America won, Pat
[1:55:24] <+krispen_wa> I WAS BORN IN LONDON
[1:55:26] <%jackelzxaa> Paige is naked of screen taunting pat
[1:55:29] <%VictorVonLouche> Accents can change
[1:55:29] <+JJJKopf> "Picard is french"
[1:55:30] <+monfo_the_great> Born on a military base
[1:55:30] <+ItalianWaifu> you know except the salarians
[1:55:31] <PanicSwytch> Future London
[1:55:33] <%Faustgesicht> Space stole his accent
[1:55:33] <%spitelite> space british
[1:55:33] <%secret_npc> Shepard says "really?" Bitch you already knew
[1:55:33] <%peachy996> You've only said that for 3 times the whole game Anderson
[1:55:37] <choocheess> I'm more of an Ass Effect guy myself
[1:55:37] <%RigmaroleHM> Maybe America had taken over
[1:55:38] <@QueequegTheater> Everyone else did, pat
[1:55:38] <TourettesPlays> @DXLelouch24 every stream
[1:55:41] <Sp3ctre48> He has to tell us he was born in Longdon again since the last time was optional Kappa
[1:55:41] <pmtriox> never gonna expand on the fact this black American man was born in London
[1:55:44] <$mattynezz> I liked the trailer well enough
[1:55:47] <%shootbang_exe> confirmed british bred out of existence
[1:55:47] <%jackelzxaa> Garrus loves shepard so much
[1:55:49] <%MightyDuckShoes> it was an I'll omen
[1:55:50] <+ThomasOfTroy> That trailer was GREAT
[1:55:51] <%alphonseisbest> YEA AND PICARD IS "FRENCH PAT"
[1:55:51] <%maenos2> gee Anderson your accent is so thick
[1:55:52] <%afronooch> Madge
[1:55:57] <%secret_npc> Look at this shit
[1:55:58] <oda_flobunaga> What about Mass Erect?
[1:55:59] <%HaroldDonchee> yo thats a lot of drop ships
[1:56:02] <AlphaRayAllen> something something Mighty Number 9
[1:56:03] <willyfreshness> shuttles are so non threatening
[1:56:04] <%MooseIsGoose> The Trailer was great
[1:56:04] <AngryAsian5> SPACE NORMANDY
[1:56:06] <+Cactuskris> you´re always dissapointed though
[1:56:06] <$lotharrio> Pat you start all things disappointed. This is established fact.
[1:56:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't even remember the trailer, I don't think I saw it
[1:56:09] <%sporeian94> I was in love with the ME3 teaser so much I played sick to stay outta church and watch it all day at home
[1:56:10] <quipquest1> That just means your a nihilistic douche
[1:56:10] <%alphonseisbest> YUP
[1:56:12] <$mattynezz> That was BEFORE they changed the ending, so you were wrong AT THE TIME
[1:56:13] <%maenos2> BERET
[1:56:14] <+itsKrisD> it's almost like people can be born in london and grow up somewhere else
[1:56:14] <%secret_npc> The Alliance used to be cool
[1:56:14] <oda_flobunaga> But Big Ben?
[1:56:14] <+tomdwarf> Fair, youre cynicism senses guided you.
[1:56:14] <James_Quivers> Looks foggy and blue, very much London
[1:56:15] <%peachy996> I knew when they compared THIS GAME  to Return of the Jedi
[1:56:15] <$StrawberryPantsu> I mean Pat it's London...
[1:56:16] <AngryAsian5> FUTURE D-DAY
[1:56:16] <%dekkitout> @pmtriox What's there to say? Some military kids are born abroad
[1:56:17] <Pt_Kamen> it's the Shire
[1:56:18] <dawarw0lf> Because of the Reapers
[1:56:18] <%cvp5127> paige you wont remember
[1:56:19] <PanicSwytch> Beret
[1:56:19] <%Varlinator> Bye Paige
[1:56:21] <@ssjklyco> I wonder what a Kojima mass effect would be
[1:56:21] <@QueequegTheater> This is why Woolie reactions get more views Kappa
[1:56:21] <LightningLynx89> Pat you can't spell bologna and didn't know it was spelt that way
[1:56:21] <Mattais88> Looks more like Palavan, actually
[1:56:22] <choocheess> what are you talking about, that's earth as fuck
[1:56:22] <%MidnightBurst12> good bye distant paige
[1:56:22] <%VictorVonLouche> Just humans no alien pals
[1:56:23] <Brandon__Brando> damn sucks to be that guy
[1:56:29] <Sp3ctre48> I wish they had like, faction specific ships instead of every race using alliance stuff
[1:56:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Andromeda did not happen!
[1:56:30] <%MightyDuckShoes> @pmtriox  By this point London was the 65th state of the United Continents of America
[1:56:31] <Treasure_Vault> I knew Star Trek: Discovery cribbed a lot from this game. Never realized how muc.
[1:56:33] <%willjar313> Halo did a better job with Earth than Mass Effect. That's kinda fuckin' depressing...
[1:56:33] <$mattynezz> All human mans, no Geths
[1:56:33] <%StoopKid241> What if they shot down Sheppard's shuttle? It's not any better than the others
[1:56:34] <%peachy996> Look at all of this! Do you get any RoTJ vibes off this?
[1:56:35] <+ItalianWaifu> i always feel bad for the guy that doesnt even get off the boat/ship
[1:56:35] <choocheess> super earthy
[1:56:35] <%cvp5127> pew pew
[1:56:38] <%ahomeschooldropout> Why are they blindly charging at rachni with 0 cover
[1:56:38] <blue8moon> Look at all these jobbers
[1:56:39] <%secret_npc> R-Day, cause of da reepars
[1:56:39] <%JoshManVGH> Ahh they all have the badass gun
[1:56:39] <kingra> No ayyys :(
[1:56:39] <%Forbidden_Karp> No women soldiers allowed apparently
[1:56:40] <ChungusQuest> ooh a Mako
[1:56:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Andromeda is a fever dream
[1:56:44] <%maenos2> MAKO
[1:56:45] <Meekest> I want Kai Leng to walk in NOW
[1:56:48] <Macguffn> Setting up the Mass Effect finale with the unneccisarily timed setting of an apocolyptic invasion? You better believe I was disapointed from trailer 1.
[1:56:49] <karl_rex> Should have had one last mako run at the end
[1:56:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Mass Effect ended at 2
[1:56:51] <%VictorVonLouche> yeah
[1:56:51] <willyfreshness> these dudes need shields bro
[1:56:54] <%StaceMcGate> SKY BEAM
[1:56:55] <$mattynezz> Picard also stole a bunch from the Reaper plot
[1:56:55] <%AncelDeLambert> oh boy blue and grey
[1:56:55] <%DrTomT18> The sky should be like, burning red.
[1:56:56] <choocheess> man those npc are really fighting each other
[1:56:56] <%jackelzxaa> Everyone make sure pat doesnt miss anything in the next section
[1:56:56] <mikesapartment> that's just london
[1:56:56] <%Forbidden_Karp> it's not great!
[1:56:56] <AlphaRayAllen> CLIPPING
[1:56:57] <Ghufufin> sky beam!
[1:56:57] <Virokwet> i know
[1:56:58] <Alzero83> no shuddup it looked good back then
[1:56:58] <%Faustgesicht> super unfinished
[1:56:58] <AllenDeadman> yeaaaaah
[1:56:58] <+SilverDevilfish> clip through that building
[1:56:59] <+ItalianWaifu> you dont like grey?
[1:56:59] <d3ltuhhh> oh god the beam
[1:57:00] <+JJJKopf> grey everything
[1:57:00] <ohno778> I think that's the point pat
[1:57:01] <dd44dostivei> SEE ALL THAT ARMY??!!
[1:57:01] <@commanderclaw> 14 Months dev time!
[1:57:01] <zerointelligence000> but war tho... realism
[1:57:01] <+ThomasOfTroy> Sadly, it always looked bad
[1:57:01] <olm46> The reapers set it up to demoralize you
[1:57:02] <%secret_npc> RUSHED
[1:57:03] <$StrawberryPantsu> THIS IS LITERALLY JUST LONDON ON A NORMAL DAY!
[1:57:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> it looks like a fan mod
[1:57:03] <%RealThiele> brown and grey yo
[1:57:03] <dawarw0lf> ...I like it kinda
[1:57:04] <chainsaw105> imagine being the guy that made it all the way here and the second the shuttle door opens you just get fucking domed
[1:57:05] <+dekkless> its DARK and MOODY
[1:57:05] <%ahomeschooldropout> Pat, whatever you do, TOTALLY DO NOT ACCIDENTALLY LOOK OUT OF BONDS
[1:57:05] <%peachy996> Yeah Earth looks like shit
[1:57:06] <jorniev> GRAY AND BLUE
[1:57:06] <NewWillinium> Mid 2010's Giant Hole in the Sky
[1:57:06] <%dekkitout> It looks very much of its time. Complete with sky laser
[1:57:06] <+rafaelba93> looks 7th gen af
[1:57:06] <KingSpunf> Neo-Croydon, capital of the Earth Alliance
[1:57:07] <OldManDeckardCain> pat, this is england. its accurate
[1:57:09] <$mattynezz> Hi Javik
[1:57:09] <@QueequegTheater> There was a convenient shuttle-sized hole
[1:57:11] <willyfreshness> hey its that guys voice
[1:57:12] <%DSD24> It’s pretty shit
[1:57:12] <%JamesCorck> Rushed, the keyword for the next two hours is rushed.
[1:57:14] <d3ltuhhh> hey it’s spartan locke!
[1:57:14] <+xcompleasedad> Yeah, you were just early with your complaints. YOU WERE 100% RIGHT, THO
[1:57:15] <%idyota> London just looks like that
[1:57:17] <%SinnerEbru> THIS is the final squad talk
[1:57:17] <+FattimusSlime> The shuttle clipped through the rubble
[1:57:19] <%afronooch> Andersons hat makes him look hella weird
[1:57:19] <%MidnightBurst12> this feels so scuffed
[1:57:21] <SolicitOpinions> I love not seeing anything distinctive in the enironment!
[1:57:21] <Zombrocom> This is just what london looks like
[1:57:24] <%NopeBadguy> IT'S LONDON IT'S ALL BAD
[1:57:29] <quipquest1> Okay, it's bad. But it does us nothing by nitpicking EVERYTHING we see tonight
[1:57:30] <Brandon__Brando> that last cutscene was trying to be saving privet ryan
[1:57:34] <%MugenSandan> wait what happened to the eyes
[1:57:38] <%peachy996> Talk to Trailer Man
[1:57:39] <willyfreshness> Londons always cloudy
[1:57:40] <%Monkeyweed21> the reapers rubbed loose papers and dirt on everything
[1:57:40] <$mattynezz> get ready for L I T T L E M O N E Y
[1:57:40] <Sp3ctre48> Who are you Major Coats
[1:57:42] <addictionex> @addictionex is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:57:44] <jtsoppy137> why London?
[1:57:46] <@QueequegTheater> @quipquest1 No, we need to nitpick MORE
[1:57:47] <%MugenSandan> Where is his BRAAAAND
[1:57:50] <%RealThiele> da troops
[1:57:50] <%JoshManVGH> @jamescorck Two hours of this!? Seriously?
[1:57:51] <%peachy996> Trailer Man looks so oddly intense
[1:57:51] <%secret_npc> Indoctrinated Trailer Man
[1:57:53] <natzo89> thats the guy from the original trailer,
[1:57:53] <%afronooch> @quipquest1 nah thats what were here for
[1:57:54] <@goose_attack_almanac> How much time has actually passed since the reapers attacked
[1:57:54] <Hemmy99> all the soldiers you gathered for this battle? only a handful made it
[1:57:55] <%maenos2> @quipquest1 makes me feel better tho
[1:57:56] <OldManDeckardCain> this is just london but without as many knife attacks
[1:58:00] <James_Quivers> It's a MASSive Effect
[1:58:01] <%WeLucklessJacks> What makes London so special?
[1:58:01] <choocheess> "and that's where my story ends. I never found out what happened to the reapers and the fate of the galaxy"
[1:58:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> the massive effect
[1:58:01] <%Varlinator> Time for sad goodbyes
[1:58:02] <@QueequegTheater> @JoshManVGH welcome to hell
[1:58:05] <%willjar313> "It looks bad, but there's still hope" is what I thought when I first played ME3.
[1:58:05] <%pokefan9956> a "mass" effect?
[1:58:07] <%jackelzxaa> Everyone’s favorite part of mass effect: humans
[1:58:09] <+The_Death_Owl> I bet it has a massive effect
[1:58:09] <illTemperedSeaBass> @quipquest1 It does us plenty. It's fun.
[1:58:13] <quipquest1> @maenos2 Then we're no better than Cinema Sins
[1:58:14] <Sapphire_Breeze> @James_Quivers eyyy
[1:58:15] <%JoshManVGH> That's Zaheed right?
[1:58:18] <Alzero83> no shuddup it looked good back then
[1:58:19] <jett_eyes> he almost did the thing
[1:58:20] <+vaderxyz1970> compared to an arsonal and Liverpool game this in nothing " drinks tea"
[1:58:23] <%chance_h> Why your eyes fixed?
[1:58:23] <tattleworm> shepard being all "i'm just a soldier" after all this really comes off as false modesty
[1:58:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> And some children too. Definetly some child soldiery at this point
[1:58:24] <Brandon__Brando> @quipquest1 yes it dose were being vulture tonight
[1:58:25] <+BeardedLuchador> Unreal 3 SUCKED
[1:58:28] <%maenos2> @quipquest1 I'll accept that
[1:58:29] <TourettesPlays> Give me ONE (1) Reason that Major Coats could not be replaced by Virmire Survivor
[1:58:29] <AlphaRayAllen> uh huh
[1:58:31] <dd44dostivei> this looks like a fallout
[1:58:31] <$mattynezz> Yup
[1:58:33] <kingra> LUL
[1:58:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BUT
[1:58:36] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:58:36] <%VictorVonLouche> Grabbed destroyed city landscape tile sets
[1:58:37] <%secret_npc> That's why ME1 still looks good
[1:58:37] <%Profmcstevie> Featureless metal works very well
[1:58:40] <alrobot2014> now that i remember how the next couple gameplay sections i'm REALLY glad you're playing baby mode
[1:58:41] <+TrevSmith222> Trailer Man is the best character next to Marauder Shields.
[1:58:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:58:43] <+Cactuskris> not true dragon age looks much better
[1:58:44] <%peachy996> Ooh! I can't wait for you to see the piles!
[1:58:45] <%dekkitout> As opposed to contemporary urban facades?
[1:58:45] <$mattynezz> This environment also nearly destroys the Engine
[1:58:46] <willyfreshness> We keep telling you london Just sucks balls
[1:58:48] <%JoshManVGH> Tchanka looked better....
[1:58:49] <rReizs> ewwww human architecture
[1:58:49] <%VioletHeart> Fun fact, Major Coats' VA also voices Raubahn in FF14.
[1:58:50] <karl_rex> Good old human refusal to build new shit
[1:58:51] <$hattrick61> @TourettesPlays vi could be dead
[1:58:52] <%lilytastic> where's the [Ruined Book]s?
[1:58:53] <%furiousfurioso> They could have just made Earth look more sci fi
[1:58:53] <+BeardedLuchador> Unreal 3 was basically a map editor hacked into being a game engine
[1:58:54] <%Fooguwu> Pat cannot see ladders he is blind to them
[1:58:55] <%peachy996> Please tell me the piles are unchanged
[1:58:57] <%jackelzxaa> The rio map from multiplayer looked ALOT better visually
[1:58:57] <%StaceMcGate> Welcome to mother base Command Shepard
[1:59:01] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah this final mission is very visibly scuffed compared to Ilos and the Suicide Mission
[1:59:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Tuchanka also had this problem to a lesser degree
[1:59:03] <%secret_npc> James
[1:59:04] <$mattynezz> There's a hidden loading sequence here because the engine can't fucking handle it
[1:59:05] <%peachy996> I love the final game piles!
[1:59:06] <@Ranryu692> there was a talk prompt
[1:59:06] <%secret_npc> Go back
[1:59:06] <%studleydoorite> and they just gave up
[1:59:07] <+Cactuskris> back
[1:59:07] <%AncelDeLambert> a barricade's a barricade
[1:59:07] <%maenos2> BOXES THAT'LL STOP THEM
[1:59:08] <%afronooch> talk to the peepo

[2:11:07] <$lotharrio> YEAH! JACK!
[2:11:11] <@QueequegTheater> "Who?"

[2:11:29] <%Varlinator> Goodbye Jack ohnBoss
[2:11:30] <intestinal_bleeding> she sounds unusually distraught here

[2:11:36] <@QueequegTheater> @Ranryu692 FUCK I CAN'T UNSEE IT
[2:11:38] <%maenos2> @ranryu692 Jesus fuck spot on
[2:11:39] <Darren716> Man Jack's ME3 design is so much better than her 2 one
[2:11:40] <+Setsuna_seiei> Jack got fixed but also fucked
[2:11:44] <olm46> Handsome Jack...
[2:11:46] <%peachy996> A long way from "Shit you look like a pussy"
[2:11:50] <dawarw0lf> her students do die if told to be front lines
[2:11:50] <%AkronymCLT> I fyou romance her she basically says "we'll bang okay?" here
[2:11:51] <%Treuan> Yeah :(
[2:11:52] <+toastybites> get Jacob out of the way so he's not the last person you talk to
[2:11:52] <kingra> LUL Yeah

[2:11:53] <@QueequegTheater> FUCK
[2:11:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Ranryu692 Huh, well god damn
[2:11:54] <mr_saturday93> YES
[2:11:55] <Wolfstriker121> kasmui never was a romantic option wasnt it on me 2 or 3 right?
[2:11:55] <Sapphire_Breeze> only 3's?
[2:11:55] <mr_saturday93> IT SUCKS
[2:11:57] <%sporeian94> FIGUREATIVELY WRITTEN BY REDDIT THE GAME
[2:11:58] <@QueequegTheater> NOW YOU GOT ME MAD TOO
[2:11:58] <%secret_npc> 3's in particular is bad
[2:11:59] <lord_sykos> RIGHT?!
[2:11:59] <%TheBensonator_> Fair and valid
[2:12:02] <%valriot> BL3 is a REALLY fun game, but FUCK
[2:12:03] <%Profmcstevie> Borderlands 3.....everything that isn't the shoot
[2:12:03] <+krispen_wa> OH GOD BL3 IS THE ME3 OF BL
[2:12:04] <kingra> Annoying shit kid right?
[2:12:04] <LightningLynx89> Just play Borderlands 3 on mute
[2:12:04] <metalsiren31> Yes entirely
[2:12:05] <alrobot2014> god she could totally fit in the borderlands universe
[2:12:05] <Sp3ctre48> I always forget Borderlands 3 came out
[2:12:06] <%dekkitout> Dammit, Borderlands 3's prose is friggin caustic
[2:12:06] <%Varlinator> Oh God, BL3's writing is the WORST EVER!
[2:12:07] <%the_Punktuation> Tales is great.
[2:12:07] <@Ranryu692> she even looks like she's colored and lit like a Borderlands character
[2:12:09] <%Mr_Pylon> Borderlands is a fun series that's cringe as fuck
[2:12:09] <%VioletHeart> BL3 is great to play. Just turn all the audio off. Never listen to anyone talk.
[2:12:10] <%afronooch> yeaaaah
[2:12:10] <willyfreshness> I stopped 3 after a few hours
[2:12:11] <metalsiren31> The game PLAYS super good
[2:12:11] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[2:12:11] <scrumbotime> Yeah......
[2:12:12] <+Aeogard> 3 would be fun if you put it on silent
[2:12:12] <%NopeBadguy> Borderlands is okay if you can't cringe enough to fucking seize up
[2:12:13] <choocheess> butt stallion huh?
[2:12:13] <AlphaRayAllen> Those villains are the worst
[2:12:16] <%peachy996> Jack is a great character to romance, Very wholesome
[2:12:16] <mr_saturday93> The writing is the fucking worse
[2:12:17] <Botman_R> I tapped out after they screwed over Claptrap's VA.
[2:12:17] <+rafaelba93> turn your brain off
[2:12:17] <Treasure_Vault> I love the parts of borderlands that aren't menus or talking
[2:12:18] <+shapeforn> I think it's always been that way kinda, but it's especially BAAD in 3
[2:12:19] <chainsaw105> Borderlands 3 massacred my boys Vaughn and Rhys and for that I can't forgive it
[2:12:20] <%BinaryFireball> cringy?
[2:12:20] <Aeroallways> 3 is so good to play but the fucking story oh my god
[2:12:20] <$StrawberryPantsu> So it's Just Borderlands?
[2:12:21] <+JJJKopf> the greatest muted games
[2:12:22] <$lotharrio> @Wolfstriker121 No, she's simping for her dead partner and sort of wants to bang Jacob. That's it for her.
[2:12:22] <+xerotwo> Yeah it's VERY CHATTY
[2:12:24] <%MooseIsGoose> I have no idea how I played it f2 times
[2:12:25] <$realm_forge> OH MY GOD RIGHT!?
[2:12:25] <$ItsRatman> Ugh the intro where you have to wait for claptrap kills me everytime
[2:12:26] <%peachy996> I would say Jack is the best Human Girl to romance
[2:12:27] <PanicSwytch> BL2 was amazing
[2:12:27] <%Monkeyweed21> IF WE MAKE A JOKE EVERY 30 SECONDS SOME OF THEM HAVE TO LAND
[2:12:27] <rytisone> get hyped for Wonderlands
[2:12:28] <jacobknight13> same
[2:12:31] <AllenDeadman> it plays great...
[2:12:31] <churropoppa> Borderlands 3 corrupted my ps4 pro and turned it into a brick
[2:12:31] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt 2 at least has Handsome Jack hamming it the fuck up, 3 is just cringe
[2:12:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> I apologized to Anthony Burch. Hopefully Tiny Tina's Wonderland would be better haha, haa...
[2:12:32] <%MidnightBurst12> It's real bad
[2:12:33] <%peachy996> Miranda in second
[2:12:34] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> It's funny how Borderlands 1's humor and tone is my favorite
[2:12:34] <Goraka91> Borderlands got all the wrong lessons from 2, and Tales is the best goddamn Borderlands game fight me
[2:12:35] <%secret_npc> 3 made me miss 2's campaign
[2:12:35] <$mattynezz> I hate BL3 for doing the Tales from the Borderlands characters dirty
[2:12:36] <choocheess> i did miss borderland 1's quiet moments
[2:12:36] <xerioes> i muted daiolage in that game after the fgirst mission
[2:12:37] <d3ltuhhh> I pressed on just because the combat was fun enough, the DLCs are alright too
[2:12:38] <%ConLin_Arts_> is that the Space Milf?
[2:12:39] <jorniev> BL2 over did it too but it had its moments
[2:12:40] <AllenDeadman> everything else is... no\
[2:12:40] <%Aleate> The dialogue in BL3 gets better in the DLC... but just BARELY gets better
[2:12:41] <%Varlinator> Goodbye Samara ohnBoss
[2:12:43] <%HaroldDonchee> God I love samara
[2:12:44] <@ssjklyco> You helped me kill my children, shepard
[2:12:44] <%Treuan> I can't wait for the new game to have an among us chapter
[2:12:45] <SaltyAzteca> TALK TO YOUR SON

[2:16:51] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Is Pat a secret Italian?
[2:16:51] <+WutangchickeN> Pat dry spaghetti has mold cultures on it you have to boil it to kill the mold starch off
[2:16:51] <scrumbotime> You want to know the only time I heard about eating dry pasta? from a PRANK that was done on someone to make them THINK it was normal
[2:16:52] <%HaroldDonchee> eat food like a normal person
[2:16:54] <$lotharrio> All of Shep's former crew talking about their heartfelt conversations with Shep. Jacob just has to keep quiet or lie.
[2:16:54] <dawarw0lf> but can you swim?
[2:16:54] <%Joshbored> Dry spaghetti is great
[2:16:55] <RetributionP> Pat is gonna perforated his stomach with dry spaghetti.
[2:16:55] <Jaysky> If it's the Mr Noodles with the dry bag, I used to put the flavor stuff in the back and crush the noodles to shit. Shake the bag. Then devour
[2:16:57] <Xiangchang> Patatouille
[2:16:57] <+pectusumbra> So this means Pat cant' swim, got it
[2:16:57] <Virokwet> (lol)

[2:20:21] <$SGrim> @commanderclaw That's alluded to in the Citadel DLC
[2:20:21] <%secret_npc> I liked the turret sequence
[2:20:24] <Sp3ctre48> IT IS
[2:20:25] <$mattynezz> This is a load screen, btw
[2:20:26] <churropoppa> "Garrus, you look too cute to be in cumshot distance." - Shepard

[2:20:31] <%HaroldDonchee> why wasn't a dude already on that shit
[2:20:33] <+JJJKopf> it
[2:20:33] <+WutangchickeN> This feels like a fucking mobile game
[2:20:34] <GoatArmageddon> You don't even have to do this lol
[2:20:35] <+titansloth93> it's funny when the big turret is less effective than your sidearm
[2:20:37] <%maenos2> you can do nothing
[2:20:38] <prime_name> It's a nice loading screen
[2:20:38] <$lotharrio> No it's engaging and epic. Can't you see?
[2:20:38] <@Ranryu692> the husks look like they're skating
[2:20:38] <%peachy996> Nothing changes if you do nothing
[2:20:39] <Sp3ctre48> Listen Pat they just needed to load the next area
[2:20:40] <+JJJKopf> turret section call of duty
[2:20:40] <rytisone> does this really scream final level?
[2:20:42] <choocheess> this is some game finishing gameplay right here
[2:20:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you did it
[2:20:43] <%Logoth_> A fucking turret section in the climax
[2:20:49] <willyfreshness> well that was pointless
[2:20:50] <ne0bunny> that was so pointless
[2:20:51] <%Faustgesicht> Turret section, back to talking

[2:20:54] <%MidnightBurst12> what was the purpose of this?
[2:20:55] <%Laecerelius> Well that was lame and unnecessary
[2:20:56] <mr_saturday93> I dont hate turrett sections but I do hate boring turret sections
[2:20:56] <%studleydoorite> it was just a fun carnival game they set up for you
[2:20:57] <Darren716> Hey now lets be fair
[2:20:57] <$realm_forge> Galaxy saved
[2:20:58] <makatu84> That is an absurdly large phone both

[2:20:58] <Parapattern> Wouldn't they have crashed into all that scaffolding over there?
[2:20:59] <Brandon__Brando> was there any point to that
[2:21:01] <Jaysky> It was a load screen

[2:21:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> "Jacob died"
[2:21:09] <%dekkitout> Was that turret section a loading screen pretense
[2:21:09] <%ZephynM> They could have that be a side scene NPCs could've handled lol
[2:21:11] <$mattynezz> GREAT scene coming up
[2:21:12] <%sniffy77> nah pat it was epic
[2:21:14] <%MidnightBurst12> right back to dialogue LUL

[2:37:06] <Make_me_mad> Javik should be making a jerk-off motion at you for that entire speech.
[2:37:07] <%Ipsenscastle> Mass Effect speeches are always so much less inspiring than they think they are LUL
[2:37:08] <$lotharrio> Good thing it faded to black or else it would have been awkward.

[2:37:15] <SaltyAzteca> "Yeah for the fireman!!!"
[2:37:15] <%DrTomT18> Not exactly 'fight with your backs against the wall and defend your homes and the freedom of all mankind and hold firm' but... whatever

[2:38:05] <%peachy996> @JustAnotherTrapArtist That song is scary good to use while the Synthesis ending plays out
[2:38:07] <Jmann1892> Mako is the greatest
[2:38:07] <%SinnerEbru> theyre chumps
[2:38:09] <Brandon__Brando> is this running a lower frame rate?
[2:38:09] <%Monkeyweed21> all the mako missions sucked
[2:38:10] <TioXyco> it drove like shit in the original ME1
[2:38:14] <%Ipsenscastle> The Mako is cool, people who hate the Mako are just bad at it
[2:38:15] <@goose_attack_almanac> @realm_forge BY THE DAWN OF THE NEXT DAY I WILL CLAP THOSE CHEEKS AGAIN
[2:38:15] <%alphonseisbest> TEAM MAKO

[2:38:17] <Sp3ctre48> I hate that it's the last mission and they're still using this same song
[2:38:19] <hat_under_bread> Driving it felt like ass. Conceptually, it's neat.
[2:38:21] <$SGrim> mako*
[2:38:23] <%secret_npc> It drove fine, you were shit
[2:38:23] <OvaltineDream> I love your evil forehead helmet

[2:38:26] <alrobot2014> the mako is the best greased pig
[2:38:28] <%LoganSchultz> LoganSchultz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! psaDogchamp
[2:38:31] <TioXyco> not in ME1 original, it was not fun
[2:38:32] <%Monkeyweed21> there's like 1 mako map that isnt trash
[2:38:33] <+krispen_wa> NO MANS LAND
[2:38:33] <Conscript_Gary> mako was fine, heightmap maps weren't
[2:38:33] <tanarath> The mako may be trash, but is OUR TRASH
[2:38:33] <+bassoontyphoon> It alllll returns to nothing
[2:38:36] <olm46> Such tactical finesse...

[2:38:44] <tanarath> Also the main cannon fucks
[2:38:44] <Sp3ctre48> Mako was great, it was the planets themselves that were the problem
[2:38:44] <RetributionP> mako is good the locations where you used the mako sucked

[2:38:55] <dds333a> rip
[2:38:55] <Conscript_Gary> good job protecting that tank shepard
[2:38:56] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah that's London alright

[2:39:06] <quipquest1> It looks average is what you mean
[2:39:06] <chancho4tierra> because it is
[2:39:07] <hat_under_bread> It looks better than the Mako dries.
[2:39:08] <SaltyAzteca> Nah thats just London LUL
[2:39:08] <chainsaw105> hell yeah look at all that convenient waist-high cover
[2:39:11] <GoatArmageddon> No money
[2:39:14] <+Aeogard> im telilin ya, me3 is great until it falls apart
[2:39:15] <ctk96> it was super fun in og Mass effect naysayers were just bad drivers
[2:39:16] <%spitelite> this looks like gears of war in a bad way
[2:39:18] <OmegaTheTree> why does everything have a shade of blue over it
[2:39:20] <willyfreshness> setting the expectations low
[2:39:20] <%willjar313> The Earth levels in Halo 2 look better than this...

[2:39:33] <%secret_npc> They don't mess around with bosses on Earth, the gameplay is best against lots of enemies
[2:39:34] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:39:34] <+Tredecian> lol
[2:39:34] <Macguffn> If we're supposed to be protecting the tanks, why are we sending them in first?
[2:39:35] <natzo89> No salarian husks
[2:39:36] <Jaysky> You sure as hell tried
[2:39:37] <$realm_forge> Did every game and movie from that era end with a giant sky portal?

[2:41:15] <$lotharrio> @HaroldDonchee Probably cause they already recorded a bunch of stuff from him before they knew they had to cut most of the Earth missions? I'unno.
[2:41:15] <+badhaye> Game should've opened with this and then ended with a big space battle
[2:41:17] <+tetraes> THE TRUE VERGIL OF THE GAME : MAURADER SHIELDS
[2:41:17] <+The_Death_Owl> He's a fan favorite character pat!
[2:41:23] <+krispen_wa> Never forget, Nihlus Health

[2:41:28] <%Wallabri> he was trying to save us, the brave marauder shields....
[2:41:29] <AluxStreams> It's poetry, it rhymes.
[2:41:30] <James_Quivers> BOO HAUNTED HOUSE
[2:41:32] <CairoCopper007> HIS NAME WAS MARAUDER SHIELDS
[2:41:33] <@Ranryu692> I think it's just supposed to be a callback
[2:41:33] <%DrTomT18> Does difficulty effect enemy Spawn?
[2:41:33] <%sporeian94> They just copypasted the thing from the beginning of the game
[2:41:36] <%willjar313> spoopy
[2:41:37] <%secret_npc> Marauder Shields is a Marauder with shields, you're playing on baby mode so you'll miss him
[2:41:38] <pmtriox> It's like poetry, it rhymes
[2:41:44] <%afronooch> Maurader Shields should be the protag of ME4
[2:41:47] <JetpackMcQuack> naw
[2:41:50] <Parapattern> Marauder Shields is EVERYWHERE
[2:41:51] <@goose_attack_almanac> Why would any human resistance be trouble for reapers. They could just beam all defensive encampments
[2:41:56] <Ravioli_Ronin> No no, this IS awful
[2:41:57] <dawarw0lf> Marauder Shields should have been Kai Lang
[2:41:57] <Estwilde> Meh. Looks fine to me
[2:41:58] <Darren716> Yup
[2:41:59] <AlphaRayAllen> Uh huh
[2:41:59] <pmtriox> Pat you honestly should be harsher
[2:42:00] <%Laecerelius> Yeah it's generic as fuck
[2:42:02] <SaltyAzteca> No Pat you GRILL the final areas
[2:42:02] <Jaysky> I thought it looked fine
[2:42:02] <Darren716> Welcome to 2012
[2:42:02] <Sp3ctre48> Nah this last mission sucks, it sucks in the singleplayer and the multiplayer
[2:42:03] <$mattynezz> Yup
[2:42:03] <supergoblinpunch> He just wants to save us from the ending
[2:42:04] <Archmortal> it also doesn't do well with 18 months
[2:42:05] <%sporeian94> Unreal Engine and Grey, name a better combo
[2:42:05] <%ErikFeral> It's like the opposite of Halo2/ODST
[2:42:06] <jbrachob> nah you are not being harsh enough
[2:42:07] <@Ranryu692> so they nailed their goal?
[2:42:09] <huskarl_zap> MARAUDER SHIELDS
[2:42:10] <+D00msDayDan> gears of duty
[2:42:11] <fluffy_sauce> nope, you are actually not being harsh
[2:42:11] <%ZephynM> Funny you say that right as I was thinking it.
[2:42:11] <rytisone> how many times have we seen a giant beam to the sky
[2:42:11] <+ItalianWaifu> kinda looks like heavy rain building wise
[2:42:13] <James_Quivers> Pat is very upset these aren't super high tech streets
[2:42:14] <GoatArmageddon> They ran out of money and time
[2:42:14] <%emMmDeeKay> It looks like an Unreal Asset Flip
[2:42:14] <jorniev> WHY IS FUTURE LONDON NOT HIGHT TECH TOO?
[2:42:14] <dd44dostivei> looks like fallout 3
[2:42:14] <%Treuan> Wayyauuugh street
[2:42:15] <$realm_forge> It’s very grey
[2:42:15] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Pat I don't think you'll be the first person harsh on Me3s ending
[2:42:16] <%strakillias> This should have taken place in the day time at the very least
[2:42:16] <+krispen_wa> WAAAAAGH
[2:42:18] <nuane> Doom 2016 Beta vibes
[2:42:19] <dds333a> rip
[2:42:20] <Jaysky> Wtf kinda location is that
[2:42:22] <Darren716> More grey than anythin
[2:42:23] <RetributionP> there is no music
[2:42:25] <+xcompleasedad> Better than brown, I guess
[2:42:25] <Brandon__Brando> your not I dont remember how bad it this was I thought it was just the ending
[2:42:25] <@Ranryu692> da ba dee da ba die
[2:42:27] <%ScrapKingKeita> Well, if it was green, you would die
[2:42:27] <ape_hawk> and your bullets are orange!
[2:42:27] <%SinnerEbru> it Is very blue tbf
[2:42:29] <%Cactuskris> thtat´s what you said to liara
[2:42:30] <%MidnightBurst12> feels like they didn't want to try to make a futuristic looking london
[2:42:31] <Dunmarkh> So you think about Liara
[2:42:31] <ctk96> no call of duty was brown this is grey
[2:42:33] <%SpcOpsBear> There's too much of a stylistic clash between the prefab white shit and the old world architecture
[2:42:33] <ape_hawk> its a color scheme
[2:42:35] <pmtriox> now imagine you were invested the entire time and this was brand new
[2:42:35] <%afronooch> Yeah silence
[2:42:35] <AllenDeadman> don't worry... it gets worse
[2:42:35] <oda_flobunaga> Dabu dee
[2:42:36] <%peachy996> Isn't it great
[2:42:37] <%Mekhet09> No.
[2:42:38] <SaltyAzteca> Its very soft
[2:42:38] <AlphaRayAllen> No?
[2:42:38] <%sporeian94> THE DEVS RAN OUTTA TIME
[2:42:38] <%Saadi90> This is the 360 era after all

[2:42:40] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Nope
[2:42:41] <Zeif00> Very of the time
[2:42:41] <KeystoneA2> Unless you count the air raid horn as music

[2:42:41] <$mattynezz> No
[2:42:42] <pmtriox> the entire time
[2:42:42] <oda_flobunaga> dabu die

[2:42:43] <Sp3ctre48> Well now there isn't there was some playing before

[2:42:44] <chancho4tierra> NO
[2:42:44] <mandorlalmond> theres no music
[2:42:44] <ape_hawk> NO MUSIC IN WAR
[2:42:44] <+OneGorillionDollars> not until later
[2:42:45] <@commanderclaw> No, enjoy the fucking nothing
[2:42:45] <%MidnightBurst12> very subtle

[2:42:46] <%Maids4lyfe> nope
[2:42:47] <dds333a> It's subtle
[2:42:47] <Darren716> Pat you haven't seen shit yet
[2:42:47] <dawarw0lf> there amabint sirens playing
[2:42:48] <oda_flobunaga> dabu dee
[2:42:48] <%Laecerelius> You'd think there would be some big music time for the ending fight
[2:42:48] <+miguelrod777> none it's TOO SERIOUS
[2:42:48] <+bassoontyphoon> Nope
[2:42:49] <Archmortal> Blue is Bioware's go-to atmospheric color when development is fucking up
[2:42:50] <%ahomeschooldropout> It doesn't look like 200 or something years in the future, it just looks like current day london
[2:42:50] <%afronooch> Yeah its "tense"
[2:42:50] <Ravioli_Ronin> There was music here, but it’s gone now
[2:42:52] <Wolfstriker121> this is just the silence of the game now
[2:42:52] <Explodincatz> earth is SAD
[2:42:52] <%sporeian94> THE DEVS RAN OUTTA TIME NO TIME TO MAKE MORE MUSIC
[2:42:52] <Thepothero> @patstaresat it’s silent
[2:42:54] <%BigCoffee> NO MUSIC IN WAR
[2:42:55] <oda_flobunaga> dabu die
[2:42:56] <Parapattern> Did the Reapers strip the paint off of every building?
[2:42:57] <Wanhangidyilinya> theres tone
[2:42:57] <willyfreshness> your emotions are the music
[2:42:57] <huskarl_zap> You know it's a bad day when it's not raining in engbland
[2:42:59] <%dekkitout> Best part about playing on easier modes is that you can stop to smell the roses- and smell bullshit
[2:43:01] <%Fooguwu> it's the silent horror of war patrick
[2:43:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the music scales with your style rank
[2:43:04] <$realm_forge> Unlike the first game’s finale nope
[2:43:06] <+Aeogard> BUDGET GONE
[2:43:06] <oda_flobunaga> I'm blue
[2:43:06] <+Blu_panda> why didn't the alliance set their own difficulty to casual? this could have saved so many lives?
[2:43:06] <blue8moon> What's the point in setting this in a major city that most players will recognize if you aren't gonna have the characters crawling through major familiar landmarks for the final stretch?
[2:43:06] <%Wallabri> you're not supposed to feel COOL in your SPACE HERO GAME, pat!
[2:43:07] <Hemmy99> Same problem with all EA games in the 7th gen. EVERYTHINGS BLUE
[2:43:10] <oda_flobunaga> dabu dee
[2:43:11] <%Saadi90> The reapers killed all music on earth
[2:43:12] <Pt_Kamen> do military shooters have music?
[2:43:14] <oda_flobunaga> dabu die
[2:43:15] <rytisone> embrace the depression
[2:43:18] <valiard> WHERES MAH LAZER BRIDGE *Pat probably*
[2:43:20] <chancho4tierra> now i remember this and feels like shit again
[2:43:21] <Jaysky> Pat if you die in baby mode I'll be concerned
[2:43:21] <pmtriox> tutorials in the final mission
[2:43:27] <Wydamn> There's no sounds on Space Earth, Pat
[2:43:29] <+titansloth93> not even a dent lol
[2:43:30] <Darren716> Hey remember the ending of ME1 when you were fighting on the outside walls of the Citadel?
[2:43:31] <%ahomeschooldropout> like ffs Halo 2 back ojn the OG xbox made a better looking war-torn Africa that didn't look like shit
[2:43:32] <dds333a> @wallabri correct
[2:43:32] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Halo has some hectic good music
[2:43:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> look at all that waist high cover
[2:43:32] <Darren716> That was neat
[2:43:33] <mandorlalmond> buda bu dee
[2:43:35] <Conscript_Gary> dr who gets it, you gotta show the reapers destroying big ben
[2:43:35] <Brandon__Brando> I like how your at the last mission still getting that tutorial message about skills
[2:43:36] <%Cactuskris> MW2 has incredibile msuic
[2:43:38] <Madinki> You know Guys Marauder Shields isn't even gonna show up because Pat is playing on baby mode.
[2:43:38] <@ssjklyco> Earth could have defeated the Reapers earlier if they just turned on easy mode
[2:43:40] <jtsoppy137> buggerd
[2:43:41] <%peachy996> He did already
[2:43:41] <%ahomeschooldropout> lmao audio playing over
[2:43:44] <Thepothero> Man citadel really spoiled us
[2:43:48] <+ItalianWaifu> so why didnt the reapers glass the planet like Reach?
[2:43:53] <+krispen_wa> Why are we supposed to care about generic marines dying?
[2:44:01] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYEYE GREEEEY!
[2:44:01] <%DrTomT18> Mass Effect 1 had a STRONG end level
[2:44:02] <+bassoontyphoon> I know, I know I’ve let you down……. I’ve been a fool to myself
[2:44:04] <Darren716> Is this Haze?
[2:44:05] <rytisone> FINAL LEVEL
[2:44:07] <pmtriox> remember in ME2 when you brought your entire team and coordinated them?
[2:44:07] <%ErikFeral> crime alley
[2:44:08] <%peachy996> Remember in Mass Effect 2 where you're fighting in a collector base near the Galactic Core?
[2:44:09] <%willjar313> Holy shit this looks like ass.
[2:44:09] <%dekkitout> Crime Alley, London
[2:44:09] <+tetraes> Suicide Mission from ME2 was so much cooler than this IMO
[2:44:10] <Wolfstriker121> SADDNESS
[2:44:10] <jtsoppy137> stinky london allyway
[2:44:10] <%ahomeschooldropout> PAT TURN IT UP TO NORMAL SO YOU DON'T MISS OUT ON THE BEST PART
[2:44:10] <%Xevtes> its so bland and dull
[2:44:11] <+toastybites> LINK THE FLAMES
[2:44:13] <Wolfstriker121> PURE SADDNESS
[2:44:14] <%SinnerEbru> CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED SERIES
[2:44:15] <%studleydoorite> D:
[2:44:15] <jbrachob> show it to woolie
[2:44:16] <mr_saturday93> reminds me of the alleyways in FEAR
[2:44:17] <%Monkeyweed21> OH SHIT ITS INVERSION
[2:44:17] <jorniev> WHY IS EARTH SO LOW TECH!?
[2:44:18] <huskarl_zap> looks like unity
[2:44:18] <Brandon__Brando> this is so lame
[2:44:19] <%SovPho> tak bak erf
[2:44:20] <Alzero83> no shuddup it looked good back then
[2:44:20] <+D00msDayDan> show this screenshot to a mass effect fan in 2008
[2:44:21] <%the_glizzy_wizzy> the 7th gen was a mistake
[2:44:21] <%king_wragles> Why are you in a Vampire the Masquerade alley, Pat?
[2:44:22] <%Faustgesicht> My parent's died here, Shepard
[2:44:25] <Thepothero> coxMistake
[2:44:26] <%Laecerelius> OH NOOOOO
[2:44:28] <Jaysky> I didn't get to play citadel at all
[2:44:34] <%Varlinator> NGL it's hurting me a little just how easy this is after going through on Insanity
[2:44:35] <%Wallabri> god Mass effect 2 is such a fun game
[2:44:36] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  Mass Effect 3 feels like EA trying to brute force Gears of War into a Mass Effect framing
[2:44:36] <%sporeian94> HERE YOU GO THE FINAL BATTLE
[2:44:38] <+UltimaRotad> why isn't there any cool space shit on earth
[2:44:38] <%Eilocke> this looks like the 3rd level in some awful Gears of War clone
[2:44:39] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> That just looks like a regular london alleyway but with fewer nitros canisters
[2:44:39] <+TheotherKristian> Man, you feel it in your heart that this only had 13 months
[2:44:41] <OvaltineDream> oh no~
[2:44:41] <Burger_Bonanza> @tetraes how could you say something so controversial yet brave
[2:44:41] <%demiiluna> WHERE WERE WE PLANNING TO GO IF THOSE BRUTES DIDN'T BLOW THROUGH THE WALL?

[2:44:46] <SaltyAzteca> Special eyes?
[2:44:47] <mr_saturday93> This is where i watched my parents die Shepard
[2:44:47] <pmtriox> pointless scene
[2:44:48] <+The_Death_Owl> @jorniev  Mass Effect is only 150 or so years into the future
[2:44:48] <%peachy996> This is like the Europe section of RE6 only instead of grey it's dark blue
[2:44:49] <oda_flobunaga> THANK GOD
[2:44:50] <chainsaw105> after my friend finished ME3 earlier this year I asked him what his order for the trilogy was favorite to least favorite and this motherfucker really said "3, 1, 2" because he didn't remember anything about 2
[2:44:51] <CairoCopper007> MARAUDER SHIELDS
[2:44:55] <Brandon__Brando> I can feel the crunch in the level

[2:45:41] <Macguffn> At a certain point an enemy becomes so 'invincible' that it removes all stakes
[2:45:41] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt hey can you read the mircale at palavan again
[2:45:43] <%Eilocke> do they expect to kill the reaper with morale damage?
[2:45:44] <%shootbang_exe> remind me why reapers need ground forces again
[2:45:52] <RetributionP> that's pretty raw that one moment
[2:45:53] <%peachy996> Behold your final combat arena
[2:45:55] <+toastybites> @Eilocke to be fair they dont really have anything else left
[2:45:57] <huskarl_zap> LOADS EMONE
[2:46:00] <$mattynezz> The actual video game portion ends here
[2:46:01] <%peachy996> This is the last fight of the game
[2:46:03] <+MEGACHAMPtv> @shootbang_exe harvest bodies
[2:46:03] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @shootbang_exe Route out people hiding
[2:46:04] <%MidnightBurst12> that's death laser height
[2:46:06] <Make_me_mad> Why didn't they have one of those rocket launchers that you used to one-shot the hades cannon?
[2:46:08] <AlphaRayAllen> It's so you have something to shoot
[2:46:08] <%Fooguwu> BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZY
[2:46:10] <+TheotherKristian> Because video game
[2:46:11] <%Profmcstevie> For harvesting(?)
[2:46:11] <%sunsetdisc0> to fuck with people who cant fly
[2:46:11] <Chatterbox1991> this part of the game is where Morinth will show up if you recruited her in ME2
[2:46:12] <dawarw0lf> why this spot never became a multiplayer map baffles me
[2:46:13] <%strakillias> If you're a biotic you could jump and float down
[2:46:16] <Goraka91> Video games, that's it
[2:46:17] <Jmann1892> Ground Forces for the Harvest
[2:46:17] <Botman_R> Cuz they big
[2:46:17] <Wanhangidyilinya> to get to hard places
[2:46:18] <%Maids4lyfe> TO SCOOP UP THE PEOPLE TO MAKE REAPERS
[2:46:18] <mr_saturday93> I do think they explained it
[2:46:18] <%Varlinator> This part is the WORST on Insanity
[2:46:18] <%DrTomT18> To stop ground forces from blowing up Reapers
[2:46:19] <AluxStreams> Reapers are too big to fit in tunnels and shit.
[2:46:20] <%ahomeschooldropout> this is the final combat section btw
[2:46:20] <pixelkingu> because it looks cool...right?
[2:46:23] <%Fooguwu> Reapers are above fighting tiny things
[2:46:24] <%spitelite> why are there two phone booths next to each other
[2:46:25] <Minorou> well, Shepard killed a reaper with regular gun in ME2
[2:46:25] <Archmortal> it's easier for ground forces to exterminate fleeing individuals
[2:46:25] <blue8moon> I assume it's to hunt down people in hiding that they can't reach easily
[2:46:25] <Sp3ctre48> Because planet sized ships that can glass planets means there's no game
[2:46:26] <%sporeian94> Subdue population to be reaped
[2:46:26] <%lofiwarlock> maybe if people hide underground?
[2:46:27] <%DrTomT18> with like, nukes. Missles.
[2:46:27] <%valriot> Reapers still need organic matter to build Reapers
[2:46:29] <%RigmaroleHM> To distract you
[2:46:30] <$realm_forge> To preserve the planets I guess?
[2:46:31] <James_Quivers> To be used later for organic material harvesting
[2:46:32] <AluxStreams> Also they're the next Collectors.
[2:46:33] <%gaomachine> Well the Asari was calling for fire support.  Presumably the artillery guys whose shit you just found were supposed to kill it while they distracted it
[2:46:33] <Jaysky> I think the reason was to get the small people hidden
[2:46:33] <$lotharrio> To flush out survivors an stuff
[2:46:34] <@goose_attack_almanac> How long has the fight on Earth been happening
[2:46:35] <Darren716> No
[2:46:35] <%afronooch> Technically no
[2:46:35] <%JohnAtDawn> Capture corpses?
[2:46:36] <%MidnightBurst12> they need ground forces to harvest people?
[2:46:38] <%ahomeschooldropout> yup
[2:46:39] <Brandon__Brando> yep
[2:46:39] <pmtriox> see this is why the idea that most of the game was great is bafflinng to me. what few good moments are overshadowed by so much garbage
[2:46:39] <Darren716> You still have the final boss
[2:46:39] <jtsoppy137> ....
[2:46:40] <+Extrallent> I think its to make them scared while your exterminating them
[2:46:40] <+xcompleasedad> ...........yeah
[2:46:40] <SaltyAzteca> @shootbang_exe They had a surplus of corpses, and Steve from accounting had this idea to use them cuz why not
[2:46:40] <@Ranryu692> harvest people to make new reapers
[2:46:40] <%ahomeschooldropout> enjoy it
[2:46:41] <chainsaw105> to be fair its a good combat arena
[2:46:42] <pmtriox> no its not
[2:46:42] <prime_name> OH IS IT
[2:46:42] <%strakillias> YES it sucks
[2:46:43] <%JamesCorck> Yeah.
[2:46:43] <dds333a> somewhat Kappa
[2:46:43] <%VioletHeart> Since their goal is collecting people to turn into Reaper goo they *do* need someone to round people up.
[2:46:43] <Wanhangidyilinya> to get to hard to reach places, for the crumbs
[2:46:44] <+miguelrod777> this parts a bitch in harder difficulty
[2:46:44] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes
[2:46:45] <$mattynezz> Yup
[2:46:45] <Jaysky> But you had laser beams that can glass planets
[2:46:45] <%KyJackshot> this room...
[2:46:45] <hat_under_bread> So they can capture the populace alive to turn them into Reaper goo.
[2:46:45] <morow1ec> nah there's still final boss Kappa
[2:46:45] <+tomdwarf> I assume to hit things that the death laser cant, like underground/fortified positions.
[2:46:45] <%WeLucklessJacks> Subversive warfare, to keep reapers on more important objectives.
[2:46:45] <%AmuserName> :)
[2:46:45] <%Varlinator> Yes, but no
[2:46:46] <+Aeogard> :)
[2:46:46] <Sapphire_Breeze> almost
[2:46:46] <blue_warzone> Damn straight it is!
[2:46:46] <alrobot2014> yup
[2:46:47] <@commanderclaw> It would make a modcium of sense if they were there to "Reap" and make more reapers out of organic species
[2:46:48] <zerointelligence000> oh hey you beat the game
[2:46:49] <crassletter> ENJOY
[2:46:49] <AngryAsian5> This is a horrible section to play on anything but baby mode LUL
[2:46:51] <RetributionP> To he honest. to collect people for making a few reaper
[2:46:52] <%JamesCorck> Yes Pat, this is the last combat section of the trilogy.
[2:46:52] <pmtriox> you have exactly ONE after
[2:46:53] <Thepothero> It’s asssss
[2:46:54] <Jaysky> Yep
[2:46:54] <GoatArmageddon> It sure is!
[2:46:55] <%Eilocke> @toastybites yeah, but at that point they should probably just save their ammo and try to hide. i guess they're just scurred
[2:46:55] <huskarl_zap> icbm mako
[2:46:55] <valiard> And they arnt EVEN REGULAR BULLETS
[2:46:56] <%JamesCorck> The Trilogy.
[2:46:56] <Javier9563> this part fucking suuuucks in insanity
[2:46:57] <%king_wragles> SPACE GAME
[2:46:57] <%sporeian94> THIS IS THE FINAL BATTLE OF THE GAME
[2:46:57] <%HaroldDonchee> concentrated fire did kill a reaper right? joker got the last shot
[2:46:58] <%peachy996> Yep this is your last true fight of the trilogy
[2:46:58] <ctk96> cause harvest not exterminate
[2:47:00] <+Kodkiro> what happened to the illusive man again?
[2:47:01] <dawarw0lf> l I like it
[2:47:02] <karl_rex> It sucks we know
[2:47:02] <%maenos2> DEFND THE TRUCKS
[2:47:03] <AlphaRayAllen> BWOOOOOOOOOOOMP
[2:47:04] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt the reapers were made too strong, so they needed to make a ground force so we could feel like we're "fighting back"
[2:47:04] <Wolfstriker121> get ready the best battle of all time..........goddamn it bioware...
[2:47:05] <makatu84> The reapers need ground forces to turn people into paste or somthing
[2:47:06] <%JamesCorck> The shooty shooty bang bang of the trilogy ends here.
[2:47:06] <Jaysky> This place. I remember this bollocks when I played on high difficulty
[2:47:06] <+dekkless> but pat its like independence day /s/s/s/s/s
[2:47:06] <%afronooch> This section legitimately drags on Insanity
[2:47:07] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt isn't it gray-et
[2:47:07] <alrobot2014> this section is why i'm glad you're on baby mode
[2:47:08] <+nivlac_555> what a great finale
[2:47:08] <+WutangchickeN> yeah it's bad... wutang6BEES wutang6BEES wutang6BEES wutang6BEES wutang6BEES
[2:47:10] <+xcompleasedad> It's a BITCH of a fight, too
[2:47:10] <Ks201> Round up for places the big ones can’t get to maybe?
[2:47:10] <%JamesCorck> This is ridiculous.
[2:47:10] <+MEGACHAMPtv> big final battle = protect missiles for 2 minutes in what is basically the multiplayer mode
[2:47:11] <willyfreshness> Its war its supposed to be shitty i guess
[2:47:14] <alrobot2014> its a slow slog otherwise
[2:47:14] <%afronooch> YOULL SEE
[2:47:14] <huskarl_zap> RAMEREZ
[2:47:15] <%DSD24> This part sucks ass on Insanity
[2:47:16] <Sp3ctre48> He's vibing
[2:47:16] <+UltimaRotad> this is the final battle of the space opera game
[2:47:16] <Jaysky> He's so elusive
[2:47:17] <%Varlinator> shhhhhhhhhh
[2:47:17] <Wydamn> also why aren't they as strong or stronger than Nylus from ME1?
[2:47:17] <pixelkingu> this game had so much potential...what a pity it all falls apart at the end
[2:47:18] <$realm_forge> BUT KAI LANG THO
[2:47:19] <%Laecerelius> IM peed his pants and ran
[2:47:19] <%Cactuskris> tim will be back
[2:47:20] <Goraka91> Fuck it
[2:47:20] <Pt_Kamen> the BioWare Magic was getting pretty thin by now
[2:47:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> to make genocide more thorough?
[2:47:20] <Minorou> he illused away
[2:47:21] <prime_name> You'll see
[2:47:21] <Dunmarkh> He just fucked off
[2:47:21] <crassletter> OH JUST WAIT
[2:47:21] <Zombrocom> Shhhh
[2:47:25] <Kalakukkoo> soon
[2:47:26] <+miguelrod777> elusive
[2:47:28] <supergoblinpunch> shush
[2:47:29] <+toastybites> @Eilocke i think its cuz most of them are actually decoys
[2:47:29] <Brandon__Brando> I can feel the crunch in the level
[2:47:30] <AngryAsian5> BUT CALL OF DUTY THOOOO
[2:47:30] <%Aleate> This is ACTUALLY a multiplayer map
[2:47:34] <Darren716> Yo that mission was rad
[2:47:35] <Thepothero> He’s taking a dump
[2:47:35] <Sp3ctre48> This is literally the multiplayer map btw
[2:47:35] <linSP> based ramirez
[2:47:36] <%terrible35> DEFEND BURGERTOWN
[2:47:36] <dds333a> he got away with everything LUL Kappa
[2:47:36] <%KyJackshot> LUL
[2:47:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god i forgot it was this bad
[2:47:37] <%bravebravesrobin> just you wait
[2:47:38] <%Fooguwu> burger town hell yeah
[2:47:38] <$SGrim> DEFEND THE BURGER TOWN
[2:47:39] <%shambarino> more like elusive man amiright?
[2:47:39] <quipquest1> Who?
[2:47:39] <%strakillias> THIS IS LITERALLY A MULTIPLAYER MAP

[2:47:40] <%shurtal> and they BOTH have Keith David
[2:47:40] <%stickislaw> oh fuck that's a callback
[2:47:41] <Goraka91> RAMIREZ
[2:47:43] <thelonechris> RAMIREZ
[2:47:43] <SaltyAzteca> AND KEITH DAVIDS WAS THERE TOO
[2:47:44] <%Cactuskris> ramirez is a hero
[2:47:44] <+bassoontyphoon> 3elusive5man
[2:47:45] <%MidnightBurst12> It was great
[2:47:45] <Darren716> At least in that mission you get the predator missles!
[2:47:46] <Wolfstriker121> DONT THINK ABOUT IT PAT!!
[2:47:46] <zerointelligence000> I was genuinely appalled by how garbage this mission was
[2:47:47] <%BioHunter> dragon age origins did it better
[2:47:48] <%peachy996> @DSD24 This is why you get Garrus and Javik with 2 Typhoons and you get one for yourself
[2:47:48] <%polothegreatest> ellusiive man being ellusive CoolCat
[2:47:48] <%Aleate> Burgertown was fucking rad
[2:47:49] <+D00msDayDan> man i wanna replay mw1 and mw2 now
[2:47:49] <dawarw0lf> @aleate its almost but not
[2:47:50] <valiard> Burger town?

[2:47:52] <%ScrapKingKeita> RAMIREZ, SHOOT THE HELICOPTER WITH A KNIFE
[2:47:52] <%sniffy77> it was a important buger town
[2:47:52] <%maenos2> RAMIREZ
[2:47:53] <AlphaRayAllen> Hey guys, MW2? Actually a really good game
[2:47:54] <Darren716> It's legit my favorite COD level
[2:47:55] <%SinnerEbru> oh i dont COD thats why
[2:47:56] <Wolfstriker121> agreed on that pat
[2:47:56] <%KyJackshot> I loved burger town defense
[2:47:56] <%Varlinator> that whole game owned
[2:47:56] <linSP> ramirez, do everything
[2:47:57] <%ZephynM> It's been so long since I played Modern Warfare.
[2:47:58] <+nivlac_555> i wish this was burger town
[2:47:58] <%Cactuskris> MW2 owns
[2:47:58] <%bravebravesrobin> Burger town FOREVER
[2:48:00] <+vaderxyz1970> Burger town is a cultural touchstone
[2:48:01] <huskarl_zap> HONEY BADGER Oscar MIKE
[2:48:01] <+xcompleasedad> ROCKET THAT FUCKING APC
[2:48:01] <Burger_Bonanza> god, I had kind of forgotten just how shit the London finale is
[2:48:04] <SaltyAzteca> KEITH DAVIDS WAS THERE WITH YOU DEFENDING BURGER TOWN
[2:48:05] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[2:48:05] <Zebroneath> Burgertown is a cool sequence
[2:48:05] <%StoopKid241> That game had a General Sheppard voiced by Hackett! Which was cool!!
[2:48:06] <AngryAsian5> Fuck yeah. MW2 was the shit.
[2:48:06] <jorniev> RAMIREZ WAS THE SHIT
[2:48:07] <+HaunchPaunch> It's been so long! i'm old
[2:48:08] <Darren716> You got sentrys, thermal m21, and the predator
[2:48:08] <ape_hawk> Defend Missile Battery
[2:48:09] <Wydamn> You told the Illusive Man to fuck off and then he ragequit the phone call
[2:48:10] <alrobot2014> Burgertown was surrounded by tanks APCs and helicopters
[2:48:12] <AllenDeadman> ya missed big guy
[2:48:12] <%dekkitout> How does one defend from an actual kaiju
[2:48:13] <makatu84> This is an actual multiplayer map
[2:48:13] <+eanscrale> Well, not like it can get any worse right???
[2:48:14] <Hemmy99> That mission was sick
[2:48:14] <nuane> man this is ResidentSleeper
[2:48:16] <%Laecerelius> GOTTA DEFEND THAT MISSILE FROM THE MOSTLY NOTHING, PAT
[2:48:17] <crassletter> mw2 was a great game
[2:48:18] <%polothegreatest> nah gears better than this
[2:48:20] <%Varlinator> Keith David just makes every game better
[2:48:21] <%afronooch> you should be
[2:48:21] <%bravebravesrobin> MW2 WAS THE SHIT
[2:48:22] <+WutangchickeN> NEVER FORGET BURGER TOWN
[2:48:22] <+D00msDayDan> i bet mw2 is still full price on steam
[2:48:23] <%DrTomT18> whatever happened to the target locator we got from the Quarians?
[2:48:24] <%SinnerEbru> is MW2 worth a revisit yall?
[2:48:24] <%Wallabri> the reaper "BWOOOOOM" is still a cool sound effect tho
[2:48:25] <%ZComiX> I want to play cod mw2 afain
[2:48:27] <IntrepidEye> RAMIREZ DESTROY THAT REAPER WITH YOUR RIOT SHIELD!
[2:48:27] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Ramirez deserved better
[2:48:27] <%willjar313> Again, this looks worse than the Earth levels in Halo 2. And those were LITERALLY tan desert levels in an African city. ON THE ORIGINAL XBOX.
[2:48:28] <@goose_attack_almanac> Why wouldn't that Reaper immediately shoot at you if the other reaper forces know you're there
[2:48:30] <pmtriox> this is still easy on insanity
[2:48:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I mean, who doesn't love running around suburbia and shooting BTRs with Javelins
[2:48:33] <%Ipsenscastle> This fight was the hardest part of the game for me, both playthroughs
[2:48:37] <AngryAsian5> Yeah. I always Baby mode this section.
[2:48:37] <prime_name> This shit sucks on higher difficulties
[2:48:37] <MaybeFalco> mw2 stream when, orb man
[2:48:39] <%Cactuskris> @SinnerEbru yes
[2:48:40] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Yeah I was gonna say Pat, that level is fucking cool. The mission after where you're fighting through suburbia looks great
[2:48:41] <Sp3ctre48> That mission being called Red Dawn was pretty raw tbh
[2:48:41] <@goose_attack_almanac> "Sheperds in that open space go laser the shit out of him"
[2:48:42] <%ZephynM> I should have gotten a refund for this game tbh. It was so not my cup of tea.
[2:48:43] <%ZComiX> Remember RAMEREZ memes??
[2:48:44] <+MEGACHAMPtv> the endings dont bother me so much as there not being a climax epic battle for earth that was being built up
[2:48:45] <SaltyAzteca> Particle Beam fucks in this mission
[2:48:48] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt I played it on the hardest mode... It wasn't fun.
[2:48:49] <+UltimaRotad> THAT WAS IT
[2:48:52] <Archmortal> There is absolutely no reason to play Cerberus HQ or Earth on any difficulty above Narrative unless you're going for the Insanity achievements
[2:48:52] <%BioHunter> seriously though why couldnt they just copy dargon age origins?
[2:49:00] <jtsoppy137> did you?
[2:49:00] <natzo89> you beat mass effect 3
[2:49:03] <$lotharrio> You Masse the Effect!
[2:49:03] <+bassoontyphoon> Well gg
[2:49:06] <%Fooguwu> Press small button to get to BIG BUTTON
[2:49:07] <%redthebaron> why couldn't edi just launch it remotely
[2:49:07] <Sp3ctre48> oh nooooo
[2:49:08] <$mattynezz> Nnnnnnnope
[2:49:12] <Minorou> don't you feel accomplished for this finale to the massive trilogy
[2:49:13] <+MEGACHAMPtv> DID U LIKE THE FINAL BATTLE WOOOOO
[2:49:15] <%DrTomT18> @BioHunter God the final mission for that game is awesome
[2:49:15] <+HaunchPaunch> There are just some games you want to get through, and thats what difficulty selection is for.
[2:49:16] <%Laecerelius> WHY NOT JUST SHOOT IT FORWARD
[2:49:16] <+eanscrale> wait... that's it?
[2:49:17] <%dekkitout> Rolled a Nat 1
[2:49:17] <morningmoondude> lol
[2:49:17] <SaltyAzteca> THIS IS IT LADS
[2:49:19] <%maenos2> LUL
[2:49:20] <oda_flobunaga> aaaaaaaand Roll credits
[2:49:20] <+OneGorillionDollars> that looked SO BAD
[2:49:21] <Sapphire_Breeze> ......
[2:49:21] <Sp3ctre48> No it didn't hit Garrus, put your glasses on
[2:49:21] <%afronooch> LUL that one fell so slow
[2:49:22] <%maenos2> WHIFG
[2:49:24] <AngryAsian5> I don't know Garrus. Did it? LUL
[2:49:24] <%Laecerelius> WHY NEED GUIDANCE?!
[2:49:25] <prime_name> THE BEAM
[2:49:25] <+krispen_wa> WHY IS THE REAPER JUST STANDING THERE
[2:49:27] <%ZComiX> RAMEREZ ASK FOR NO PICKLES
[2:49:29] <intestinal_bleeding> BEEM
[2:49:29] <%Logoth_> Should have brought the tresher maw
[2:49:30] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Cut scene missiles

[2:49:49] <@goose_attack_almanac> seriously why isn't the reaper just shooting sheperd here
[2:49:49] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> That's some X-Com 90% miss shit
[2:49:49] <%Varlinator> HOLD THE LINE PAT!!!!
[2:49:50] <+UltimaRotad> He's literally not even in any danger
[2:49:52] <IntrepidEye> Too incompetent to make missiles fly straight WTF
[2:49:52] <+HaunchPaunch> It's just standing there, MENACINGLY!
[2:49:53] <%studleydoorite> smack your butt at it
[2:49:54] <%DSD24> I wish we had the special eyes
[2:49:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> this is terrible

[2:50:02] <ChungusQuest> Where were these Reaper-killing missiles the rest of the game?
[2:50:02] <%sniffy77> FUCK THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM JUST POINT AND SHOOT
[2:50:03] <Jaysky> @goose_attack_almanac That would be mean
[2:50:04] <pmtriox> *Tali points a shotgun to the back of your head*

[2:53:39] <Macguffn> The weak spot was only glowing
[2:53:40] <Virokwet> but big bomb
[2:53:40] <intestinal_bleeding> THE ENDING GETS WORSE, SHEPHERD
[2:53:40] <%Eilocke> it's just a beta reaper
[2:53:41] <Jaysky> Thats a tiny reaper
[2:53:42] <+xcompleasedad> It's hard to hit the bigger ones, I guess
[2:53:42] <dds333a> too many shields Kappa
[2:53:43] <alrobot2014> now send down one out of the 40 million other reapers in atmosphere
[2:53:43] <oda_flobunaga> Its just a Cyberdemon

[3:01:42] <%redthebaron> don't worry about it
[3:01:43] <ctk96> I mean look where it came from
[3:01:44] <%Profmcstevie> .....that was fucking awful and all of chat was screaming it like 20 seconds before it was onscreen
[3:01:44] <%sporeian94> BECAUSE THEY RAN OUTTA TIME TO DESIGN A MODEL
[3:01:44] <Dunmarkh> So you know
[3:01:45] <AlphaRayAllen> Shhhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:01:46] <%Mekhet09> NO TIME
[3:01:46] <prime_name> Theres only one reaper model
[3:01:46] <+BeardedLuchador> Harbinger isn't a character any more
[3:01:46] <chancho4tierra> MARAUDER SHIELDS YOU WERE THE FINAL BOSS WE DESERVE
[3:01:47] <+Tredecian> because
[3:01:48] <jbrachob> reasons
[3:01:48] <James_Quivers> Harbinger always looked like that
[3:01:48] <%maenos2> shhh
[3:01:49] <%Varlinator> It's dumb. You're all dumb for liking Marauder Shields.
[3:01:50] <%DrTomT18> color change with the remake
[3:01:50] <+OneGorillionDollars> shut up
[3:01:50] <%SovPho> money
[3:01:50] <$mattynezz> Because shut up
[3:01:50] <Jaysky> Same reason there's no human reaper
[3:01:50] <Goraka91> Because fuck you
[3:01:51] <chhdez> Painted flames
[3:01:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> Because stuh up
[3:01:52] <%Fooguwu> Harbinger was always yellow and he was there too
[3:01:53] <%KyJackshot> because ya know
[3:01:53] <Archmortal> Harbinger had yellow eye lights
[3:01:53] <+haleford> Models are hard
[3:01:54] <%MidnightBurst12> He got a makeover for your date
[3:01:54] <%SinnerEbru> dont worry about it, pat
[3:01:55] <oda_flobunaga> Harbinger was yellow
[3:01:55] <Sp3ctre48> He looked the same I thought?
[3:01:56] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> upgrades?
[3:01:57] <intestinal_bleeding> you know it's a shame, because I do really like how hopeless it kinda feels against the reapers, if only the ending didn't botch it so hard
[3:01:57] <hairtoday> who cares about harbinger is the reason
[3:01:58] <+mr_miyagucci> I forgot about marauder shields LUL
[3:01:58] <AngryAsian5> They made that lone Maurader the literal last thing you shoot. It was the final boss. LUL
[3:01:59] <%ahomeschooldropout> You see why the indoctrination theory was so popular
[3:01:59] <huskarl_zap> space benis
[3:01:59] <%NopeBadguy> Did we ever see Harbinger in person?
[3:02:00] <olaksi> shut up chat cops
[3:02:01] <legion0047> technically they are all unique
[3:02:01] <blue8moon> cause they only have the one model LUL ?
[3:02:02] <+TrevSmith222> Insert the dongle!
[3:02:05] <thebalticguy1> @PatStaresAt we need an emote to say what is new content
[3:02:05] <Dunmarkh> cazyblind
[3:02:06] <TioXyco> because "nobody will notice"
[3:02:06] <%sniffy77> ran outta money for the main antagonist pat
[3:02:06] <%Puhff> RIP Marauder Shields, best among us :(
[3:02:07] <dawarw0lf> Harbinger always looked like that
[3:02:07] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt because bioware sucks and dropped the ball hard
[3:02:07] <Sp3ctre48> Good line Hacket
[3:02:08] <Zombrocom> Harby was always yellow
[3:02:08] <alexandrecau> kai dead yet?
[3:02:08] <%sporeian94> THIS IS ADDED BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS WHY THEY ALL DON'T RETREAT AFTER MAJOR COATS SAYS EVERYONE DIED
[3:02:08] <ohno778> NIHILUS NOOOOO
[3:02:10] <+TheAlbinoSaxon> unique models are expensive
[3:02:11] <huskarl_zap> the e CRUSSY
[3:02:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SOMEONE
[3:02:13] <Virokwet> 2013 copium got me tearing up
[3:02:14] <pmtriox> HOW?
[3:02:14] <%ahomeschooldropout> literally the only explanation was that this whole section was  a dream
[3:02:16] <%Piemono> Who's reporting that?
[3:02:20] <olm46> Let's hope the citadel's completely unguarded
[3:02:22] <%SinnerEbru> the russy
[3:02:23] <%Varlinator> Well, we're in it now. No stopping
[3:02:26] <JetpackMcQuack> you did it
[3:02:27] <%emMmDeeKay> what report?
[3:02:30] <pmtriox> no
[3:02:31] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah a bunch of these scenes were not in the original game
[3:02:31] <%peachy996> Look at the piles of bodies Pat!
[3:02:31] <prime_name> YES
[3:02:32] <Ravioli_Ronin> How are the reapers just not swarming there crucible
[3:02:33] <%secret_npc> Indoctrination yes
[3:02:34] <@goose_attack_almanac> No thats the only excuse
[3:02:34] <Zombrocom> Uh, no?
[3:02:34] <hairtoday> it should have been
[3:02:34] <PunchSlugfest> look closely at the piles
[3:02:35] <%SpcOpsBear> DREAM WAS A THEORY
[3:02:35] <Conscript_Gary> No, dream theory is a cope
[3:02:35] <Goraka91> No, that's a stupid fan theory
[3:02:35] <intestinal_bleeding> I think that's just the indoctrination theory
[3:02:36] <thebalticguy1> Thats what indoctrination theory says
[3:02:36] <Alzero83> Indoctrination dream
[3:02:36] <%sporeian94> HERE COMES THE WEIRD INDOCTRINATION NOISE WHEN SHEP WAKES UP!
[3:02:37] <%bravebravesrobin> I actually really like this part in the Citadel
[3:02:37] <Brandon__Brando> shut up one guy
[3:02:38] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the core of Indoctrination Theory, yes
[3:02:38] <%maenos2> some think it is
[3:02:38] <Burger_Bonanza> what? no.
[3:02:38] <karl_rex> NO
[3:02:39] <Wydamn> Pat, you're past the point in the game where you are rewarded for using your brain.
[3:02:39] <%ScreamLord> Indoctrination Theory
[3:02:40] <%KyJackshot> Just play it and see for yourself
[3:02:40] <+haleford> Indoctrination theory
[3:02:41] <%afronooch> That was the indoctrination thoery
[3:02:41] <%peachy996> Look at the low quality thin people
[3:02:41] <+JJJKopf> imagine if they just actually gave them another year of dev time
[3:02:41] <%akscully> no
[3:02:41] <pmtriox> Bioware said this wasn't a dream years ago
[3:02:42] <IntrepidEye> no thats a theory
[3:02:42] <$mattynezz> No, that's the indoctrination theory stuff
[3:02:42] <LightningLynx89> No
[3:02:42] <chainsaw105> so you asked what happened to the civilians on the citadel earlier
[3:02:43] <+BeardedLuchador> That's how everyone connected it together yeah
[3:02:43] <Dunmarkh> One guy?
[3:02:44] <Archmortal> no, they're saying that's the only reasonable out of universe explanation
[3:02:44] <$hattrick61> thats the indoctrination theory
[3:02:45] <%sporeian94> INDOCTRINATION NOISE
[3:02:45] <Sp3ctre48> one guy
[3:02:46] <%valriot> Man, wtf are people talking about.

[3:02:50] <James_Quivers> Chat is being MONDO fuckin stupid tonight
[3:02:50] <alrobot2014> this is how indoctrination theory coped with it
[3:02:50] <%sniffy77> what if there's a million enemies in the citadel all pointing there guns at the one weak point
[3:02:51] <Goraka91> It's a REALLY stupid fan theory
[3:02:51] <+Tadashi047> fan theory
[3:02:52] <blue_warzone> No it’s just shit
[3:02:52] <AngryAsian5> The theory is that everything after Harbinger kicked your shit in is the dream.
[3:02:52] <Zombrocom> No that's just copium

[3:02:55] <%charp35> Thats the indoctrination theory
[3:02:55] <+SmigGames> it's the indoctrination hypothesis
[3:02:56] <%emMmDeeKay> How did Anderson get on?
[3:02:56] <AllenDeadman> dusty
[3:02:56] <Wolfstriker121> the theory comes into play here
[3:02:56] <%sporeian94> HOW DID ANDERSON MAKE IT UP AFTER YOU IF EVERYONE DIED!?!?!?!
[3:02:57] <%MooseIsGoose> no dream theory is just people not accepting reality
[3:02:57] <prime_name> HOW DID ANDERSON MAKE IT?!
[3:02:57] <%secret_npc> This is clearly all some head fucky stuff
[3:02:58] <karl_rex> BIG LIE
[3:02:58] <%RigmaroleHM> woolieONEGUY
[3:02:59] <%ScreamLord> How?
[3:02:59] <pmtriox> indoctrination theory is bullshit
[3:03:00] <%Aleate> Its that Indoctrination Theory stuff that the devs deconfirmed
[3:03:00] <+thehotrefrigerator> I like how the laser blasted off Shepard's armor and that's it
[3:03:02] <Brandon__Brando> wait how
[3:03:02] <%TheAdMerlin> @PatStaresAt the fan theory of indoctrination explains everything weird and bad, but Bioware HATES it because they didn't come up with it
[3:03:02] <+toastybites> STOP WITH THE INDOCTRINATION THEORY
[3:03:03] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt no, I'm saying that the indoctrination theory was popular because the only way you could explain it was if it was a dream because nothing makes sense
[3:03:03] <chhdez> Headcanon
[3:03:03] <CairoCopper007> Yes, there used to be something called: the indoctrination theory. we tried to rationalize it was him being controlled
[3:03:04] <olaksi> "it's a dream" is always stupidest fan theory possible
[3:03:04] <$lotharrio> If you believe Indoctrination theory, then the game is already over and you're hallucinating.
[3:03:04] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's not stupid
[3:03:04] <TioXyco> there was the "indoctrination theory" for a while, but the devs said "what? no, fuck you"
[3:03:05] <%VivaLetina> first stage of grief is denial
[3:03:05] <MrATheGreat> Shep "died" on the final run if I recall the indoc theory
[3:03:05] <Brandon__Brando> HOW
[3:03:07] <dawarw0lf> indoctrination WAS DUMB AS SHIT
[3:03:07] <+BeardedLuchador> EXACTLY
[3:03:07] <%emMmDeeKay> Bullshit!
[3:03:08] <jorniev> WHY IS HE MELTING?
[3:03:08] <AlphaRayAllen> HOW
[3:03:09] <mr_saturday93> ITS SO STUPID
[3:03:09] <%sporeian94> HOW DID HE FOLLOW YOU UP IF EVERYONE DIED!?!?!
[3:03:09] <%afronooch> @James_Quivers were alwasy mondo stupid, this aint new
[3:03:09] <thebalticguy1> no shut up
[3:03:10] <%MidnightBurst12> ???
[3:03:12] <%Bt_Robot> DON'T YOU REMEMBER PAT?  EACH REAPER IS A NATION UNTO ITSELF, COMPLETELY UNKNOWABLE AND UNIQUE
[3:03:12] <%secret_npc> Head Fucky, clearly
[3:03:13] <PanicSwytch> BULLSHIT
[3:03:14] <%emMmDeeKay> HOW did anderson get on?
[3:03:14] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah he's just here somehow
[3:03:14] <JetpackMcQuack> indoctrination makes more sense
[3:03:14] <Alzero83> BS
[3:03:15] <PunchSlugfest> INDOCTRINATION
[3:03:15] <%DrTomT18> I hate the indoctrination theory. It's way to depressing
[3:03:16] <chancho4tierra> indoctrination theory to forget that this shit is the final
[3:03:17] <Wydamn> The writers already said indoctrination theory was just a fan theory and not what they intended.
[3:03:17] <+BeardedLuchador> FUCKIN EXACTLY
[3:03:17] <AngryAsian5> EXACTLY
[3:03:17] <%bread_assassin> It’s not a dream. People are just dumb.
[3:03:17] <hairtoday> he followed
[3:03:18] <Wolfstriker121> EXACTLY
[3:03:18] <%Fooguwu> PUNISHED SHEPARD
[3:03:18] <James_Quivers> They came up thru the back door
[3:03:19] <brandt_connors> so dumb
[3:03:19] <%lilytastic> couldn't you literally see your teammates' bodies in the piles in that section? is that in this one?
[3:03:21] <%afronooch> JUST WAIT
[3:03:22] <+LegacyOfTheSith> HahaThink HahaThink HahaThink
[3:03:22] <%shootbang_exe> too bad bioware doesn't like the fan theory that's better than the surface level read of the ending
[3:03:22] <%studleydoorite> how did Anderson get passed Marauder Shields??
[3:03:23] <mr_saturday93> It literally doesnt make any sense
[3:03:23] <NewWillinium> Oh yeah remember your question about everyone on the Citadel?
[3:03:23] <$mattynezz> This is a cool location at least
[3:03:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> WHAT
[3:03:27] <%bravebravesrobin> shhhh,don't think about it
[3:03:28] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Shit like this with Anderson is why the Indoctrination Theory is popular
[3:03:29] <+tomdwarf> No, its indoctrination fan theory stuff.
[3:03:29] <prime_name> THE ENDING STARTS NOW
[3:03:32] <Ravioli_Ronin> Writing so bad the wacky fan theory was 1000% better
[3:03:34] <%sporeian94> HE IS LITERALLY DESCRIBING WHAT YOU'RE SEEING, IT MAKES NO SENSE
[3:03:34] <quipquest1> Also Aria's remains
[3:03:35] <iswearimjustdandy> Indoctrination theory is the same energy as sherlock secret season
[3:03:35] <MrATheGreat> YEAH ITS FUCKKED
[3:03:36] <+haleford> There was no time
[3:03:37] <alrobot2014> you can now see why people came up with literally ANY reason to cope
[3:03:38] <%Laecerelius> Meat for the new Reaper
[3:03:38] <%MidnightBurst12> people chunks
[3:03:40] <%peachy996> Only human remains?
[3:03:40] <%AncelDeLambert> man, Indoctrination Theory is such copium
[3:03:43] <tattleworm> kelly's in that pile over there
[3:03:43] <%akscully> it's how the keepers make food
[3:03:44] <%Wallabri> Keeper's like "eh, whatever"
[3:03:45] <%ZComiX> LETS GO INDOCIMT
[3:03:47] <Brandon__Brando> @MrATheGreat Biowear said its not a true theory
[3:03:49] <%cooldude69xx> Everyone's been reduced to shitty, shitty textures
[3:03:50] <JetpackMcQuack> it's not a theory if we decide it's true
[3:03:51] <Sp3ctre48> The fan theory was fun but it's 200% cope
[3:03:54] <%secret_npc> This isn't just theory shit, this is CLEARLY presented as a mind fuck
[3:03:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Goraka91 Even the game devs said it was a really well-thought-out theory that they "weren't smart enough" to think of themselves. It might be wrong, but it's not stupid
[3:03:56] <+krispen_wa> Indoctrination theory is just as bad as the actuap ending
[3:03:57] <%SaiyanShoto> That bug is chill
[3:03:58] <%Mekhet09> Remember he arrival dlc. I just want you to remember it when you see the ending.
[3:04:00] <%SinnerEbru> is the old ME3 ending laid out anywhere?? i wasnt around for that news
[3:04:01] <+thehotrefrigerator> The ending now start bad
[3:04:03] <%afronooch> indoctrination theory was bad. It made more sense than the og ending, but it wasnt any better
[3:04:03] <pmtriox> look at those bitmaps
[3:04:06] <Ravioli_Ronin> They just moved the citadel there, what LUL
[3:04:06] <+reknownblackcat> is there going to be a CSB this week chat?
[3:04:07] <%bravebravesrobin> and the REAL reason for the Keepers
[3:04:08] <beefcakemanthrob> evacuate everybody to the citadel, people! it's safe there...
[3:04:10] <olaksi> indoctrination theory is dumb, like 99% of fan theories
[3:04:11] <%walternatorz> YEP
[3:04:12] <+JonathLP> Remember the Citadel has been here less than a day
[3:04:13] <Make_me_mad> Indoctrination theory is dumb. Just accept the ending is bad.
[3:04:14] <%HaroldDonchee> @peachy996 I mean it is earth
[3:04:14] <+SilverDevilfish> Indoctrination theory is the Squall is dead of the 2010's
[3:04:15] <%DSD24> This was added too
[3:04:16] <%sporeian94> HE IS DESCIRING LTIERALLY WHERE YOU'RE STANDING. IT MAKES 0 SENSE
[3:04:17] <brandt_connors> yeah tomorrow
[3:04:17] <%Ipsenscastle> Welp it was really worth it saving Kelly Chambers wasn't it
[3:04:18] <pmtriox> STILL not the worst it gets

[3:04:19] <%Varlinator> Just keep movin Pat
[3:04:20] <prime_name> KEEP GOING PAT, IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE
[3:04:20] <%Fooguwu> you're in INDOCTRINATION CITADEL MIND PALACE
[3:04:22] <%peachy996> Look at the piles of thin people
[3:04:22] <mr_saturday93> the indroctronation theory was just a coping mech thats it
[3:04:22] <%cooldude69xx> @afronooch That doesnt make sense
[3:04:22] <LoneFonte> @reknownblackcat tomorrow
[3:04:23] <%WeLucklessJacks> Never really liked the indoctrination theory. Just made a bad ending even worse by limiting choices.

[3:04:31] <Sp3ctre48> Shut up it's cool
[3:04:32] <Goraka91> @ThomasOfTroy I hate "it was all a dream you lost all along" as an ending
[3:04:32] <Parapattern> It is so strange that Anderson is here too
[3:04:32] <%the_Punktuation> Everyone on the Citadel Died.
[3:04:32] <jtsoppy137> yeah....
[3:04:32] <kingra> How is it stupid?
[3:04:32] <%Varlinator> It's fine. Everything is fine
[3:04:33] <scrumbotime> they sucked the juice out of living people specifically right?
[3:04:34] <%RigmaroleHM> Poor filing system
[3:04:34] <%terrible35> dont try to think pat
[3:04:34] <TioXyco> not yet
[3:04:35] <%SinnerEbru> just keep goin to the end
[3:04:35] <Mattais88> They've sucked out all the juice already?
[3:04:35] <%AncelDeLambert> do you see DO YOU SEE?
[3:04:36] <%the_Punktuation> The Keepers cleaned
[3:04:36] <Wolfstriker121> BODY SNACTHERS?
[3:04:36] <pmtriox> entirely this is wrong
[3:04:38] <$SGrim> @TourettesPlays aNDERSON
[3:04:38] <Retinolgaming> YET
[3:04:39] <%Wallabri> you know, the good ol' Citadel Corpse Pile
[3:04:39] <%polothegreatest> WHOA HOOOOO
[3:04:39] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Now it is time for you to understand the pain we felt.
[3:04:40] <%ScreamLord> Shut up
[3:04:40] <+HaunchPaunch> Pat don't think
[3:04:41] <%spitelite> EMOTION
[3:04:42] <+D00msDayDan> the bodies look like mannequins
[3:04:43] <ChungusQuest> They still have to go get the hammers
[3:04:43] <%maenos2> SEE WHY PAT
[3:04:44] <%lilytastic> they're curing the meat
[3:04:45] <Sapphire_Breeze> do you SEE
[3:04:45] <AlphaRayAllen> WOAH
[3:04:46] <%kyh9> This section of the game madae SO little sense, people assumed it was a hallucination
[3:04:46] <roughday25> remember, according to the devs, Bailey and everybody on the citadel is actually ok somehow!
[3:04:47] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt The collector bases also had corpse piles before the Processing
[3:04:47] <%sniffy77> oh boy this is it
[3:04:47] <spuginky> were in...HECK
[3:04:48] <jacobknight13> the corpses are maiden and ashly character models from me1
[3:04:48] <+miguelrod777> there's a lot of bodies there aren't enough keepers
[3:04:48] <Wydamn> Pat, using logic will only hurt you at this point
[3:04:48] <%Puhff> Keeper's just liek wow this rock sure is interesting
[3:04:48] <%sporeian94> HE IS LITERALLY DESCRIBING WHAT HE'S SEEING AT YOUR EXACT POSITION
[3:04:49] <%peachy996> THAT PILE
[3:04:49] <%HaroldDonchee> theyre a secret tool for later
[3:04:52] <knight_verse> Yet
[3:04:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I like the indoctrination theory, fans just hated that their choices didn't matter (which they didn't) So I think Bioware changed the intended ending to meet demand
[3:04:53] <%emMmDeeKay> This whole place makes no god damned sense
[3:04:53] <ohno778> Castlevania
[3:04:55] <%shootbang_exe> totally not indoctrinated according to bioware
[3:04:55] <+krispen_wa> the final boss should have been a fistfight with Harbinger in the rain
[3:04:57] <%valriot> Pat, you think they just instantly goo them
[3:04:58] <GuyNamedGatsby> Shhhhhhh Pat the old ending was leaked, this is fiiiiiine
[3:04:58] <+thehotrefrigerator> Why doesn't Shepard just eat some medi-gel?
[3:05:00] <%Eilocke> this is cool in its own way, but not really Final Level cool
[3:05:01] <TourettesPlays> @TourettesPlays YOU'RE ALREADY HIS FAVORITE
[3:05:02] <%CapnBeefs> The citadel is powered by bodies!!!!!
[3:05:03] <Jane_Lo> oh im right at the time
[3:05:04] <Alzero83> Ashley an Kaidan Armor corpses @PatStaresAt
[3:05:04] <+reknownblackcat> @LoneFonte @MaybeFalco Thank you two,
[3:05:05] <kingra> Yep
[3:05:07] <intestinal_bleeding> yessir
[3:05:07] <PunchSlugfest> JUST WAIT

[3:05:11] <prime_name> It gets worse
[3:05:11] <PunchSlugfest> THERES MORE
[3:05:11] <+BeardedLuchador> That's why everyone thought it was a dream sequence
[3:05:12] <%Bt_Robot> WHY ISN'T HE USING MEDIGEL?
[3:05:12] <%afronooch> @afronooch og ending had a bunch of plot holes. Explaining those plot holes with the indoctrination theory, doesnt make the theory good. theyre both bad
[3:05:12] <%AncelDeLambert> this is all so BADLY written
[3:05:13] <JetpackMcQuack> cause it's a dream :)
[3:05:14] <%willjar313> Just wait. It gets WORSE.
[3:05:15] <ShiningAxis> Then you ain't seen nothing yet
[3:05:16] <Sapphire_Breeze> JUST WAIT
[3:05:16] <Jmann1892> It gets more absurd
[3:05:16] <%redthebaron> anderson is the main character of his own mass effect game
[3:05:16] <%studleydoorite> yeah no way Anderson got passed Marauder Shields
[3:05:16] <Archmortal> Fuck.  Casey.  Hudson.
[3:05:17] <$SGrim> @TourettesPlays BUT MORE THOUGH
[3:05:17] <%sporeian94> PAT HE'S LITERALLY DESCIRING THE BRIDGE YOUR ON WITH NO WHERE IN SITE

[3:05:21] <jacobknight13> why cant younjust use medigel?
[3:05:23] <Goraka91> But wait there's more
[3:05:23] <%secret_npc> Tell me none of this is in Shepard's head
[3:05:23] <Wolfstriker121> you would think if HE MADE IT IN the would at least be at the same spot
[3:05:24] <tattleworm> so much of indoctrination theory was because all this shit seemed utterly ridiculous
[3:05:25] <Sp3ctre48> At least SHOW him making it
[3:05:25] <+JonathLP> It gets so much worse Pat
[3:05:25] <intestinal_bleeding> pat hasn't seen the whole ending has he?
[3:05:25] <CairoCopper007> yup, another thing the indoctrination theory tried to. rationalize as being a dream
[3:05:27] <%AncelDeLambert> you're not done, either
[3:05:27] <%peachy996> Are you sure?
[3:05:27] <TourettesPlays> Pat I refuse to believe this is the worst plot contrivance youve ever seen. It's bad, but not the worst
[3:05:27] <+HaunchPaunch> I died, but I'm alive - Yeah me too!
[3:05:27] <%Aleate> @TourettesPlays More Favoriter-er
[3:05:30] <Mattais88> Should have said he got up first
[3:05:30] <%AncelDeLambert> it gets WORSE
[3:05:31] <oda_flobunaga> Brain surviving atmospheric reentry levels of stupid?

[3:06:56] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Goraka91 I hate that trope too, but there are a LOT of things that actually do point to indoctrination. If those things HAD been intentional, it wouldn't have been just some handwave bullshit to avoid having to write a proper ending
[3:06:57] <Wolfstriker121> ITS THE THEROY!

[3:07:55] <%shootbang_exe> reaper magic

[3:07:57] <Brandon__Brando> @LightningLynx89 BIOWAER SAID ITS NOT TRUE IDK WHAT YOU WANT
[3:07:57] <%Varlinator> He's been here for ages
[3:07:57] <%peachy996> Shut up
[3:07:57] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Dont ask
[3:07:57] <Dunmarkh> Magic
[3:07:57] <Hellarussian> he was chillin around a corner
[3:07:58] <AlphaRayAllen> He ran there
[3:07:58] <blue_warzone> Shut up though
[3:07:58] <%Laecerelius> Cerberus magic, don't thinka bout it
[3:07:58] <jbrachob> SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[3:07:58] <+D00msDayDan> is he gonna say synthesis in this spiel too?
[3:07:58] <%valriot> Pat.. they already said
[3:07:59] <SaltyAzteca> He was always there I think?
[3:08:00] <knight_verse> Man, Indoctrination theory is the dumbest thing fans have ever desperately created.
[3:08:00] <Archmortal> He's the new Saryn
[3:08:00] <James_Quivers> He was already in the Citadel, Pat
[3:08:01] <%kyh9> Pacified the reaper forces and walked in
[3:08:01] <%Xevtes> DONT THINK ABOUT IT PAT
[3:08:01] <+xerotwo> ILLUSIVE MAN
[3:08:02] <Aeroallways> reapers let him in
[3:08:02] <%greasypete00> is the illusive man basically just teh outsider but more definitely malicious
[3:08:03] <%studleydoorite> Marauder Shields let him by
[3:08:03] <Ravioli_Ronin> I guess he was always there
[3:08:04] <+miguelrod777> he told the reapers remember
[3:08:04] <%AmuserName> "fled to the Citadel lol" LUL
[3:08:04] <Macguffn> Reaper magic
[3:08:04] <@Ranryu692> he got to the Citadel before the Reapers did
[3:08:05] <GizmoKSX> He's here because he read the script.
[3:08:05] <%lilytastic> he let the reapers in i thought
[3:08:05] <Jaysky> Snuck in magic
[3:08:06] <$mattynezz> He got here before the Reapers and hid in a closet or something
[3:08:06] <makatu84> Illusive mans indoctronation powers a so fucking dumb
[3:08:07] <%Eilocke> the reapers probably just rolled out the red carpet for their bitch
[3:08:07] <brandt_connors> he was already there I think
[3:08:08] <%cade_calrayn> He was on the Citadel already, he helped them take it - they said that already
[3:08:08] <%HaroldDonchee> reaper magic
[3:08:09] <%ScreamLord> He hid in the corner while the Reapers hauled off the Citadel
[3:08:09] <%ahomeschooldropout> IF HE WAS ALREADY HERE WHY DIDN'T HE ACTIVATE SHIT
[3:08:09] <quipquest1> Indoctrination theory says neither of them are really here
[3:08:10] <willyfreshness> My reaper senses are tingling
[3:08:10] <Wolfstriker121> it was me all along shepard....anderson gos "son of a.."
[3:08:11] <+TheAlbinoSaxon> Speculation for everyone!
[3:08:12] <%alphonseisbest> The fan theory was fun but it's 200% cope
[3:08:12] <%dekkitout> Does Tim know about the Leviathans?
[3:08:12] <$realm_forge> SITH CULTISTS PAT
[3:08:13] <@goose_attack_almanac> Do you like the mind control vignette ?
[3:08:13] <%sporeian94> SEE THE REAPERS ARE IN LITERAL CONTROL OF YOUR BODY
[3:08:14] <$lotharrio> Cerberus sucks like that.
[3:08:14] <+xerotwo> BULLSHIT doodScrub
[3:08:14] <mr_saturday93> I forgot how much i hated this entire section of the game
[3:08:14] <+MagmaRam> god this game is a mess
[3:08:15] <%afronooch> The illusive man using his magic reaper powers doesnt mean shepards indoctrinated lol
[3:08:17] <%DSD24> Anderson is super right
[3:08:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Listen to the Admiral!
[3:08:19] <%kyh9> BULLSHIT *Starts playing Limp Bizkit*
[3:08:19] <tattleworm> or perhaps a third way
[3:08:19] <+tomdwarf> I mean, I'd LIKE it to be true, but I know the devs think otherwise.
[3:08:19] <%peachy996> Stop asking questions, Just appreciate the ending Bioware gave you
[3:08:20] <Archmortal> you were told he went to the Citadel
[3:08:21] <Goraka91> Fucking budget Saren
[3:08:21] <+krispen_wa> MEHEM is far better than indoctrination
[3:08:22] <+bassoontyphoon> SHEPARD JUST SHOOT TIM JESUS FUCK
[3:08:23] <Brandon__Brando> is this all added?
[3:08:23] <topiodonk> people making pokemon theorys about this game is the worst copium i have seen
[3:08:25] <+TheLocalRival> LOOK AT HIS LEGS
[3:08:26] <storm_odst> Reapers are using him so they just let him in
[3:08:28] <+dementedcactus> So Wesker…
[3:08:29] <alrobot2014> @PatStaresAt remember how he somehow brought the Citadel to earth
[3:08:32] <dds333a> You're really stupid IM LUL
[3:08:33] <%stickislaw> look at your finger clip through the gun
[3:08:33] <SaltyAzteca> AH YOU STUTTERED
[3:08:33] <%Mekhet09> Hey remember what happens when you destroy a mass relay?
[3:08:35] <+TrevSmith222> Literally, if humanity didn't cross the mass relays they wouldn't have been caught up with the Reapers.  lol
[3:08:37] <ctk96> remember he went to the citadel and told the reapers
[3:08:37] <oda_flobunaga> This is Deus Ex human Revolution, but worse
[3:08:39] <@QueequegTheater> NUH HUH
[3:08:39] <%valriot> Pat you dont need to try to make this worse by not remembering stuff the game said
[3:08:39] <pmtriox> what a stupid dichotomy
[3:08:40] <Sp3ctre48> Cause they're brainwashing robots you moron
[3:08:40] <%sporeian94> @Brandon__Brando NO THIS IS ALL OG CONTENT
[3:08:45] <%AncelDeLambert> "Control, Shepard, Control. Just Control. Have I mentioned Control? You should Control the Reapers, Shepard. You just need Control."
[3:08:47] <Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Remember he ran to the reapers to snitch, which is why the citadel is at earth
[3:08:49] <%dekkitout> Dammit man, have you not seen Jurrasic Park
[3:08:49] <Jaysky> ur wrong
[3:08:49] <%sporeian94> THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER WAY PAT
[3:08:54] <Sp3ctre48> This is old stuff
[3:08:55] <GuyNamedGatsby> @patstaresat he got there because the old ending was leaked
[3:08:58] <%Cactuskris> the thing is he is right
[3:09:00] <Zombrocom> He's actually right though LUL

[3:10:17] <%DSD24> TIM gets so bad here
[3:10:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate all of this so much
[3:10:18] <Sp3ctre48> This issue is so weird, like even if you could control the Reapers, why even listen to this crazy man who's been fighting you the whole war
[3:10:20] <%secret_npc> Everyone in this room is Shepard
[3:10:22] <JonGmen5> Anderson
[3:10:22] <Brandon__Brando> this is shit
[3:10:22] <@QueequegTheater> COPIUM "I'M IN CONTROL"
[3:10:22] <Macguffn> Wait... he still needs the crucible to control it and it isn't in yet...
[3:10:23] <%peachy996> This is fanfic tier
[3:10:24] <%SinnerEbru> @xerotwo LUL
[3:10:24] <%SovPho> illusive man bad character
[3:10:24] <+Hardgames> Sheen really put in a good performance here despite how stupid it is
[3:10:25] <%Varlinator> He's so full of COPIUM
[3:10:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I N D O C T R I N A T E D
[3:10:26] <%Laecerelius> LISTEN TO YOURSELF, SAREN 2.0!!
[3:10:26] <fluffy_sauce> they made him a two bit villain
[3:10:27] <thelonechris> Jesus Christ he sounds like a fucking manchild
[3:10:27] <Hellarussian> am I out of touch?
[3:10:28] <prime_name> The acting carries this so hard
[3:10:29] <Minorou> I'm not mad! You're mad!
[3:10:29] <%dekkitout> Tim: "No! I am not cringe!"
[3:10:29] <nuane> how do they hinge the finale on such a bad idea not even worth consideration
[3:10:31] <%Buzzard42> Martin Sheen working for that paycheck
[3:10:31] <+bassoontyphoon> No!
[3:10:35] <%peachy996> This is the end of a fanfiction
[3:10:35] <jorniev> THIS IS JUST SAREN AGAIN BUT NOT AS GOOD
[3:10:35] <Ravioli_Ronin> This is the worst fucking writing
[3:10:35] <%Cactuskris> IT can
[3:10:36] <$lotharrio> "This reaper tech jammed in my throat is proof I'm NOT indoctrinated!"
[3:10:39] <+Ches_Neckbeard> I just realized after all these years that Shepard is indoctrinated enough that the Illusive Man can control him but you're the Chosen One
[3:10:40] <dds333a> He's losing it
[3:10:45] <Macguffn> YOU'RE STOPPING THEM FROM CONNECTING THE CRUCIBLE!!!!!!
[3:10:45] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU, Shepard, YOU'RE the one that belongs in this boat, not me! I'm the only sane one here!
[3:10:45] <pmtriox> so stupid
[3:10:45] <Jaysky> YOU ARE CRINGE TIM
[3:10:46] <quipquest1> This is literally a repeat of Saren
[3:10:49] <Jaysky> ACCEPT IT
[3:10:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> Martin Sheen is a treasure
[3:10:50] <%SinnerEbru> never even knew TIM was martin sheen, goddamn
[3:10:50] <kingra> Kai Leng was COOL -Illusive man
[3:10:53] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It sucks because all three actors are doing their damnedest, but it's just unsalvageable
[3:10:54] <%whyskeywolfe> Of course, he’s right. The Control ending is literally what he wants.
[3:10:57] <%alphonseisbest> @Ches_Neckbeard The fan theory was fun but it's 200% cope
[3:10:57] <+The_Death_Owl> should have gotten Charlie sheen to voice this monologue
[3:10:57] <+Aeogard> kek or cringe TIM
[3:10:57] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Hey didn’t Anderson get shot in the gut like 10 seconds ago
[3:10:58] <Ravioli_Ronin> How did they look at this and say “yeah, this is a quality script we can work with”?
[3:11:00] <+D00msDayDan> now shoot yourself and let's skip the boss fight
[3:11:02] <%DrTomT18> @Jaysky NOOOO I'M BASED

[3:11:06] <Sp3ctre48> Oh no not a predator
[3:11:07] <%ScreamLord> Saren's line
[3:11:07] <+pectusumbra> This is LITERALLY "I'm not owned! I'm not owned!"
[3:11:10] <%secret_npc> "Listen to YOURSELF, YOU'RE indoctrinated"
[3:11:10] <SaltyAzteca> YOU HAVE POWERS, WHY USE GUN

[3:11:47] <Jaysky> Ye
[3:11:47] <topiodonk> lmao it actually is
[3:11:48] <Sp3ctre48> And the conclusion to this dumb plot was him just being Saren....again
[3:11:48] <%RealThiele> but shutup tho
[3:11:48] <pmtriox> Saren -.5
[3:11:49] <+krispen_wa> Saren was so much better
[3:11:50] <AlphaRayAllen> IT SUCKS
[3:11:50] <JetpackMcQuack> D:

[3:11:54] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt There was supposed to be a big final boss fight with TIM but this was the era of 'boss fights are too video gamey' so they cut it
[3:11:55] <+Kodkiro> this happen last time

[3:11:55] <+Ancopro> worse saren
[3:11:55] <willyfreshness> ok see ya
[3:11:56] <Brandon__Brando> the illusive man shouldn't of even been in this game
[3:11:56] <Sp3ctre48> THE EXACT SAME THING

[3:11:58] <%Laecerelius> SAREN BUT WORSE!  YAY!
[3:11:58] <%Forbidden_Karp> Shep's talked two people into killing themselves
[3:11:58] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @alphonseisbest oh I don't disagree that just hit me though
[3:11:59] <%MidnightBurst12> lame
[3:12:00] <Conscript_Gary> oh I always solve this renegade and shoot him instead
[3:12:00] <huskarl_zap> it rhymes
[3:12:01] <jacobknight13> identical to saren
[3:12:01] <%AncelDeLambert> The Illusive Man would fucking NEVER
[3:12:01] <%maenos2> SAME WAY
[3:12:01] <%TheBensonator_> BITCHED OUT
[3:12:01] <$realm_forge> Yup
[3:12:01] <scrumbotime> Saren 2 but he's a nazi
[3:12:01] <%Nekros4442> PERSONA
[3:12:02] <+D00msDayDan> saren v2
[3:12:02] <+Kyma1020> it's the exact same thing
[3:12:03] <Alzero83> cause shuddup
[3:12:03] <@Ranryu692> no time
[3:12:03] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Arigato Shep-Sama
[3:12:03] <Burger_Bonanza> literally just a worse rehash of saren, yup
[3:12:03] <%ScrapKingKeita> RIP Anderson
[3:12:04] <spuginky> ok bye
[3:12:04] <+hatok> that was the plan
[3:12:04] <%afronooch> NO TIME
[3:12:04] <%sniffy77> bye tim
[3:12:04] <faldin> saren 2
[3:12:04] <mikesapartment> there's no time
[3:12:04] <MrATheGreat> JUST. LIKE. SAREN
[3:12:05] <+TheAlbinoSaxon> MAN REMEMBER MASS EFFECT 1
[3:12:05] <Darren716> Now for it to really start to suck
[3:12:05] <+lucaflowe> omg it's literally Saren
[3:12:05] <%Mekhet09> Because you literally would die.
[3:12:05] <GizmoKSX> Death Star 3.0
[3:12:05] <linSP> a man chooses btw
[3:12:05] <crassletter> SEE HOW FUCKING RUSHED THIS IS!?
[3:12:06] <%Monkeyweed21> NO TIME
[3:12:06] <prime_name> NO TIME
[3:12:06] <%notsoy> shoot him again just to be sure imo
[3:12:06] <hairtoday> TOO VIDEOGAMEY!
[3:12:06] <dds333a> that solves it
[3:12:06] <natzo89> no budget
[3:12:06] <pmtriox> because he doesnt
[3:12:07] <%Aleate> Also Anderson is dead on the ground
[3:12:07] <+hatok> they had to cut it
[3:12:07] <brandt_connors> not fully indoctrinated
[3:12:07] <Goraka91> They forgot about that part
[3:12:07] <%DashXero> Because Saren was cool.
[3:12:07] <Mattais88> Because human husks are wimps
[3:12:08] <oda_flobunaga> just wait
[3:12:08] <HipsterHarbinger> There's no time
[3:12:08] <%JoshManVGH> And now he gets up...
[3:12:08] <@QueequegTheater> It's even worse camera work
[3:12:08] <Hozak> You don't have a krogan filling him full of lead
[3:12:08] <%MidnightBurst12> cause he a bitch
[3:12:08] <@goose_attack_almanac> Because Humans get to be husks
[3:12:08] <$SGrim> The Illusive Man? more like The Suicide!
[3:12:08] <AllenDeadman> AND WE'RE HERE
[3:12:08] <TioXyco> not worth the time
[3:12:09] <%sporeian94> Because it would've been quote "too  videogamey"
[3:12:09] <%ScreamLord> Crunch\
[3:12:10] <%RealThiele> he bitch
[3:12:10] <Wolfstriker121> ITS THE SAME ENDING LIKE SAREN
[3:12:10] <lloyddboy> THEY HAD BOSS CONCEPT ART FOR HIM
[3:12:10] <AlphaRayAllen> I guess Anderson is just dead?
[3:12:10] <+toastybites> the last good scene of the game
[3:12:11] <Archmortal> he didn't have enough upgrades
[3:12:11] <%Piemono> What if he turned into Kai Leng
[3:12:11] <Sp3ctre48> Hopefully not that part though, that was kinda silly LUL
[3:12:11] <%willjar313> Because Saren was well written.
[3:12:11] <%akscully> no mandibles
[3:12:11] <AluxStreams> They were gonna do that but thought a talk-battle was better.
[3:12:11] <%ErikFeral> There's no time
[3:12:12] <LightningLynx89> NO TIME
[3:12:12] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Because that would be interesting
[3:12:12] <%emMmDeeKay> Because that was apparentely TOOO VIDEOGAMEY
[3:12:12] <%shootbang_exe> saren but lame
[3:12:13] <+nivlac_555> mass effect 1 is the better game
[3:12:13] <OtakuSnake1> Cuz he has a smaller dick
[3:12:13] <%Faustgesicht> He was but it was cut
[3:12:14] <roughday25> because a boss fight would be catharsis
[3:12:14] <+unhuggable1> WHY does shephard bleed where anderson was shot HMMMMM
[3:12:14] <%TheWinged7> they ran outta money
[3:12:14] <Darren716> Pat you haven't seen anything yet
[3:12:14] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> That's actually in the artbook Pat, robo TIM
[3:12:15] <@commanderclaw> Cause "Boss fights are too videogamey"
[3:12:15] <%MightyDuckShoes> he was supposed to
[3:12:15] <%LaughingCatt> Because that would be "too videogamey"
[3:12:15] <$mattynezz> He was going to, but they decided it was TOO GAMEY
[3:12:15] <%demiiluna> Because Sovereign assumed direct control
[3:12:16] <%Logoth_> If you clip your hand into your wounds they'll heal faster
[3:12:17] <quipquest1> Devs said it would have been "Too video-game-y."
[3:12:17] <scrumbotime> Saren 2: more racist than before
[3:12:17] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  you get a little bit more dialogue if you shoot Illusive Man
[3:12:17] <thebalticguy1> becasue marauder shields has to be the final boss
[3:12:18] <@ssjklyco> It's just poorl  recycled
[3:12:18] <+SmigGames> he can't top marauder shields anyway
[3:12:19] <blue8moon> yeah saren killed himself then turned into a cool monster
[3:12:21] <%emMmDeeKay> GET TOO VIDEO fucking GAMEY
[3:12:21] <+xcompleasedad> Because fuck you, no boss fight in a series that has final bosses for the first two
[3:12:21] <+thehotrefrigerator> Did... did Anderson just wait for that scene to be over to finally fall down from his gunshot?
[3:12:21] <%secret_npc> He pressed the button
[3:12:21] <+TrevSmith222> "Speech check" is Shepard's strongest ability.
[3:12:22] <$lotharrio> You already had a final boss. Remember Marauder Shields?
[3:12:23] <Brandon__Brando> why did they copy that and not the suicide mission
[3:12:24] <metalsiren31> THERE'S NO TIME
[3:12:24] <$realm_forge> CUZ HE’S A BITCH
[3:12:24] <%Mekhet09> TIME FOR THE COLOR.
[3:12:25] <gromitless> The renegade version of that is so much better
[3:12:25] <%VictorVonLouche> so that was pointless

[3:18:28] <%Varlinator> Yes.
[3:18:28] <Visorak6> DARK ENERGY WAS BETTER
[3:18:28] <+krispen_wa> THIS IS SO DUMB
[3:18:28] <%MidnightBurst12> that's so dumb
[3:18:29] <%secret_npc> Pretty much
[3:18:29] <Minorou> this is just antispiral but worse
[3:18:29] <+cermo55> not the geth, they're cool
[3:18:30] <duke_of_dozel> Do you think the reapers were hunting down monkeys and shit?
[3:18:30] <%DSD24> Yes they were
[3:18:30] <$MrWurmles> No.
[3:18:30] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Most
[3:18:30] <Chatterbox1991> WE JUST DID THIS SONG AND DANCE ON RANNOCH
[3:18:30] <Archmortal> FUCK YOU KID THE GETH ARE AWESOME
[3:18:30] <The_Murray_Carp> Its just like the guren laggans

[3:18:32] <thebalticguy1> PRETTY SURE
[3:18:32] <+thetunnelhomer> yup
[3:18:32] <RaidenRising> KILL CHAOS
[3:18:32] <$lotharrio> There's literally no reason for synthetics to kill organics.
[3:18:33] <%shootbang_exe> yes
[3:18:33] <%sporeian94> YEAH IT WAS JUST THE TWO ON THE RIGH TORIGINALKLY
[3:18:33] <kingra> Yeah
[3:18:33] <Sigma_190_Beta> YES THEY WERE.
[3:18:33] <LightningLynx89> Yes
[3:18:34] <%Monkeyweed21> yes
[3:18:34] <Hellarussian> mhm
[3:18:34] <brandt_connors> some
[3:18:34] <MrATheGreat> yep
[3:18:34] <+MEGACHAMPtv> the only good ending is shooting the child
[3:18:34] <%UberKingKai> This is just a shitty SMT game
[3:18:34] <+JonathLP> Some not all
[3:18:34] <prime_name> YUP
[3:18:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> KILL THE KID
[3:18:34] <jorniev> YES
[3:18:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> Not all I think
[3:18:35] <Botman_R> Some of them
[3:18:35] <Burger_Bonanza> not all of them
[3:18:36] <IvanMistwalker> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[3:18:36] <Wolfstriker121> yes
[3:18:36] <%peachy996> Also reminder: You're still outside in Space
[3:18:36] <$MrWurmles> No they weren't.
[3:18:37] <%willjar313> SHOOT THE CHILD.
[3:18:37] <Mattais88> Not all
[3:18:37] <%watts121> kinda?
[3:18:38] <tanarath> YES
[3:18:38] <%RealThiele> some
[3:18:39] <%spitelite> this is stupid
[3:18:41] <+GingerStrawhat> Yes a lot of them
[3:18:41] <pmtriox> NONE OF THESE QUESTIONS ANSWER ANYTHING THOUGH
[3:18:41] <ape_hawk> i give my penis a fair shake but i still get piss on my pants
[3:18:42] <+HaunchPaunch> Is Shepard's voice coming from the child?
[3:18:42] <$mattynezz> I think so. Some of it was anyway
[3:18:43] <+MagmaRam> The dark energy/entropy plot was way fucking cooler.
[3:18:43] <%valriot> NO
[3:18:43] <iswearimjustdandy> The universe is infinite??? Why is this a problem????
[3:18:44] <%barrakuta371> all shepard has to say is the geth
[3:18:45] <%Nekros4442> No, I remember these questions back before that update
[3:18:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> not all of them
[3:18:47] <+bassoontyphoon> most not all
[3:18:48] <jacobknight13> yes because the original was waaaaay dumber
[3:18:49] <%SinnerEbru> this kid is a piece of shit
[3:18:49] <olm46> Not all
[3:18:50] <%KyJackshot> the left ones were added
[3:18:51] <%sporeian94> GREAT SOLUTION
[3:18:54] <ctk96> then ignore chat from here on
[3:18:54] <+dementedcactus> That’s just the organic Matrix
[3:18:55] <intestinal_bleeding> "by the way you can't possibly understand our purpose, but here we are going to explain our purpose"
[3:18:55] <+Ches_Neckbeard> the reapers are god from the battlestar galactica series
[3:18:55] <%valriot> The only thing added was related to Leviathan
[3:18:56] <chancho4tierra> i remember this
[3:18:56] <+lucaflowe> There is no fair shake it stays stupid
[3:18:57] <Mattais88> Way to fail
[3:18:57] <Conscript_Gary> "Hey remember EDI and all of the Geth? Yeah no fuck those moral lessons.
[3:18:57] <%secret_npc> There were questions, dlc just expanded on them
[3:18:58] <nuane> BANG UP JOB KID
[3:19:00] <%RealThiele> peace
[3:19:01] <Dunmarkh> You're doing the literal opposite
[3:19:03] <+haleford> This makes so much less sense without the Leviathan DLC, jesus christ
[3:19:04] <AngryAsian5> God this is the dumbest shit. LUL
[3:19:04] <IvanMistwalker> bullshit
[3:19:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SO I KILLED EVERYONE
[3:19:06] <prime_name> IT'S JUST HAL
[3:19:06] <SaltyAzteca> I thought there were just plans
[3:19:06] <%greasypete00> so then hes biased
[3:19:07] <jtsoppy137> yep
[3:19:08] <Goraka91> REAPERS ARE PUNK BITCHES
[3:19:08] <jacobknight13> I hate this stupid kid
[3:19:08] <%emMmDeeKay> Save and try shooting the bastard to see what happens, if you can't save don't try it
[3:19:08] <Madinki> @HaunchPaunch Yes and the female one
[3:19:08] <MrATheGreat> don't mind that people are dying inthe background right now
[3:19:08] <James_Quivers> Yerp
[3:19:08] <+krispen_wa> WHY DIDNT THEY USE A REAPER VOICE FOR THIS
[3:19:09] <%afronooch> ye
[3:19:09] <%the_glizzy_wizzy> So on Steam you have to pay for the extended ending
[3:19:09] <thelonechris> Why is it a kid though?
[3:19:11] <willyfreshness> I hate this kid so much
[3:19:12] <ExpressNode> Is this a child from the Whites in SMT IV or what?
[3:19:13] <%Varlinator> Leviathan
[3:19:14] <Sp3ctre48> There is nothing that says multiple writers weren't talking to each other while working on this then the series acting like it's always had this Synthetics vs Organics as the main theme
[3:19:14] <duke_of_dozel> He just called Shepard a monkey
[3:19:14] <%MooseIsGoose> There is fighting happening right now in the back ground
[3:19:15] <%Mekhet09> It's stupid.
[3:19:15] <%sporeian94> ALSO WHY DOES SHEPARD'S VOICE ECHO WHEN THE CATALYST WALKS?
[3:19:15] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:19:16] <Jmann1892> One Job and it BOTCHED IT
[3:19:17] <nuane> but the geth????
[3:19:17] <%Laecerelius> This was the WORST IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF THE GALAXY
[3:19:18] <JetpackMcQuack> post mortis
[3:19:20] <$mattynezz> Imagine NOT HAVING LEVIATHAN
[3:19:20] <Dunmarkh> By idiots
[3:19:22] <%secret_npc> I'd just turn on Emote now, Pat
[3:19:23] <%polothegreatest> hes the avatar, kill him
[3:19:24] <Brandon__Brando> but why a kid?
[3:19:24] <olaksi> yeah Leviathan being DLC is the dumbest decision
[3:19:24] <%greasypete00> whyd they make you a tiny kid tho
[3:19:24] <CopingFawn> Humans ARE animals, you dumbfuck AI!
[3:19:27] <+Kodkiro> why a child?
[3:19:27] <Mattais88> GIGABOTCH
[3:19:28] <%JoshManVGH> Man... Dark Matter story would have been so much cooler
[3:19:28] <%Mekhet09> It makes no sense.
[3:19:28] <%WeLucklessJacks> The Reapers ain't very smart.
[3:19:29] <%DSD24> I hate this stupid kid voice
[3:19:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I hate you space child. Ihateyousomuch.
[3:19:30] <samuelfisk> The Reapers have never showed any inkling of concern for organic life before this
[3:19:30] <lloyddboy> This would've been more tolerable if Star Child was the Virmire Sacrifice
[3:19:31] <prime_name> WHY THE KID VA?!
[3:19:31] <Virokwet> sure
[3:19:32] <JetpackMcQuack> The war in the background is so good
[3:19:32] <+MagmaRam> Leviathan doesn't make this good.
[3:19:32] <DapperCadavr> the Leviathan stuff adds an interesting wrinkle at least
[3:19:33] <%sporeian94> LOL AND THIS ISN'T CONFLICT
[3:19:34] <+eanscrale> Damn this series is never going to come back from THIS
[3:19:37] <%Piemono> Shepard's voice is also under all the child voice lines
[3:19:38] <%Garthunox> You can hear the voice of Jen Hale and Mark Meer with the young child, which is a nice touch, i guess
[3:19:41] <%Monkeyweed21> WE TRIED NOTHING AND FAILED SO JUST KILL THEM ALL
[3:19:41] <+bassoontyphoon> I’m surprised the quarians didn’t make this guy
[3:19:44] <%afronooch> @lloyddboy oh fuck, yeah
[3:19:44] <%MightyDuckShoes> so the geniuses solved the robot problem with a super smart.... robot...
[3:19:44] <+haleford> I never saw Leviathan until this stream, makes so much more sense. Still bad
[3:19:49] <%valriot> Space Zodiark LUL LUL
[3:19:49] <Aiutare47> I would honestly hate this less if he had a cool reaper voice rather than a weedy bitch-ass one
[3:19:50] <teridax4> It would work much better if it was just Shepherds voice and not the kid’s
[3:19:53] <+thehotrefrigerator> @lloyddboy That's actually a great point
[3:19:55] <%peachy996> Why couldn't this just have been Ashley's Form? Why the stupid child?
[3:19:57] <+Ches_Neckbeard> don't use the Reapers as a peace keeping force! Fuck that commit genocide over and over
[3:19:58] <alrobot2014> @Piemono i think i hear both Shepards too
[3:20:00] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[3:20:00] <%HaroldDonchee> there was conflict so we made BIG conflict
[3:20:07] <duke_of_dozel> RyuChamp
[3:20:07] <JetpackMcQuack> both sides bro
[3:20:09] <%RealThiele> oops all genocide
[3:20:09] <+HanbaobaoZaiNar> Shephard, that's horrible for your posture. Just stand up straight.
[3:20:11] <Darren716> peachy996 Emoshions
[3:20:12] <%maenos2> @alrobot2014 yeah I do too
[3:20:13] <pmtriox> SO FUCKING STUPID
[3:20:13] <Mattais88> SO WAS YOURS
[3:20:13] <Sp3ctre48> They were kind of space tyrants tbf
[3:20:14] <%polothegreatest> So skynet
[3:20:14] <%DSD24> It should have just been Shepards voice
[3:20:16] <+miguelrod777> apex race wasn't that smart
[3:20:18] <%peachy996> Why not use the form of the dead VS instead of some shit kid you don't care about
[3:20:19] <%zanz_san> holy fuck
[3:20:20] <%afronooch> NOPE
[3:20:20] <%DashXero> "Ah fuck. I can't believe you've done this."
[3:20:20] <@commanderclaw> Pat's gotten quiet, he's actually angry now
[3:20:21] <Goraka91> Piss off ghost child
[3:20:23] <%Ipsenscastle> shhhhh
[3:20:23] <pmtriox> sure isn't
[3:20:24] <AllenDeadman> nope
[3:20:24] <duke_of_dozel> Nope
[3:20:26] <Sigma_190_Beta> IT'S NOT!!
[3:20:27] <%Mekhet09> NOPE
[3:20:27] <%peachy996> But VS was the first emotions!
[3:20:28] <AlphaRayAllen> "I'm using war as a business, so I can end war as a business!"
[3:20:29] <%afronooch> Don't expect consistency form here
[3:20:29] <+krispen_wa> NIPE
[3:20:29] <+ThomasOfTroy> Not enitrely, no
[3:20:29] <Jane_Lo> it's sure as hell not
[3:20:30] <pmtriox> it explains nothing
[3:20:30] <%Varlinator> Isn't it?
[3:20:30] <willyfreshness> they didnt put much thought into it
[3:20:31] <Thepothero> none of it is pat
[3:20:32] <+krispen_wa> NOPE
[3:20:32] <Archmortal> correct
[3:20:32] <+The_Death_Owl> rbeeS
[3:20:32] <+xerotwo> IT BEGINS doodRage
[3:20:33] <%RealThiele> but shitup tho
[3:20:33] <%redthebaron> no
[3:20:33] <%watts121> that's not even cosistant with the entire premise
[3:20:33] <Sigma_190_Beta> SHHHHHHHHHH
[3:20:35] <%SinnerEbru> the reapers suck bc theyre murdering life to "protect" them. destroy
[3:20:35] <%sporeian94> IT'S A ROGUE AI AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TREAT IT AS SUCH, SHEPARD JUST ACCEPTS IT AS SUCH
[3:20:36] <JetpackMcQuack> they just flipped
[3:20:38] <%VictorVonLouche> this is advance racism
[3:20:39] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  levithan was made after Extended Cut
[3:20:39] <$lotharrio> "Synthetics always kill organics. I wanted to stop it. So I, a synthetic, killed the organics that created me, so that Id didn't have to kill organics."
[3:20:39] <prime_name> THIS ENDING IS GONNA DO THAT A LOT
[3:20:40] <+eanscrale> Wow, there was no salvaging THIS was there?
[3:20:41] <%peachy996> Consistent Writing?
[3:20:50] <huskarl_zap> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:20:55] <hairtoday> better not argue. shepard
[3:20:55] <%DrTomT18> This is the other side of the story, I guess?
[3:20:55] <tanarath> You're right :)
[3:20:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> IT'S BAD
[3:20:55] <duke_of_dozel> Shepard also asks who the reapers creators are when he already knows
[3:20:56] <%machshop> bioware magic, shut up
[3:20:57] <crassletter> YUP
[3:20:57] <Sp3ctre48> It was from the leviathan's perspective though
[3:20:57] <Sigma_190_Beta> Consistency? This is Mass Effect 3 @PatStaresAt
[3:20:57] <%MooseIsGoose> No don't worry about it
[3:20:58] <+dementedcactus> So the hive mind can’t control them?
[3:20:59] <%greasypete00> who caaaaaares who needs writing cohesion
[3:21:00] <%maenos2> FUCK YOU CASEY HUDSON
[3:21:00] <%afronooch> Buckle up cause theres more
[3:21:01] <%Aleate> Writing :)
[3:21:02] <+Tredecian> consistent?
[3:21:02] <%ScrapKingKeita> It's operative was "Preserve Life and then the AI threw it out
[3:21:04] <Sigma_190_Beta> There is no Consistency.
[3:21:05] <%Cactuskris> it´s the end solution the AI came to
[3:21:05] <%ahomeschooldropout> WHAT
[3:21:05] <+ItalianWaifu> tbf laviathin could be bias but ya your ight
[3:21:06] <SaltyAzteca> @eanscrale Game was rigged from the start
[3:21:07] <UrsaPyro> They made a dumb dumb A.I.
[3:21:08] <%ahomeschooldropout> WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT
[3:21:10] <JetpackMcQuack> it's so fucking stupid LUL
[3:21:10] <$realm_forge> This is correct
[3:21:11] <$SGrim> Two sides of an argument from opposing factions often don't agree.
[3:21:13] <Darren716> Isnt it the opposite?
[3:21:13] <%DSD24> Form follows function
[3:21:14] <%ahomeschooldropout> YOU ALREADY KNOW
[3:21:15] <Wolfstriker121> WHYY
[3:21:15] <+hatok> Pat the Leviathan was created to preserve life not terraform
[3:21:16] <%maenos2> I WILL HATE YOU FOREGER CASEY HUDSON
[3:21:16] <Macguffn> To be fair, when you make this many mistakes, it begins hard to keep track of them all
[3:21:18] <%walternatorz> WTF
[3:21:18] <$mattynezz> They created an AI, they obviously follow the same patterns
[3:21:18] <knight_verse> So he's lyig to you? Who knew.
[3:21:19] <+tomdwarf> No, the AI was given the task "Solve organic/synth conflict, we dont like our slaves dying". The AI decided "Okay, we'll kill life before that happens!"
[3:21:21] <natzo89> They tasked them to preserve organic life against synthetics. It kills organics so that synthetics don't kill them. Math answer.
[3:21:22] <%RealThiele> squidbillies form
[3:21:22] <+ALazo> they did though. They specifically said they made it to stop the synthetics to stop killing organics. The dumb thing is that they made a synthetic for it
[3:21:26] <%ErikFeral> Solve Conflict is the last command you want an AI to try to solve
[3:21:26] <+xerotwo> doodBait
[3:21:27] <huskarl_zap> TICK TECHNOLOGY
[3:21:31] <JetpackMcQuack> EARTH IS ON FIRE
[3:21:31] <ppi1993> HE KEEPS SAYING THE SAME LINES
[3:21:32] <fluffy_sauce> Mac Walters everyone! Isn't he a great writer?!
[3:21:32] <pmtriox> "only solution"
[3:21:37] <prime_name> THE ONLY SOLUTION
[3:21:39] <kingra> Marauder shields died trying to save us :(
[3:21:41] <%AncelDeLambert> the entirety of this horseshit is to the effect that the Reapers are flying tombstones killing every species that exists at a certain intelligence in order to keep them from dying. By killing them.
[3:21:41] <pmtriox> no they donn't
[3:21:42] <%emMmDeeKay> This kid is that windows error that says "Task Failed Suscessfully"
[3:21:43] <%Mekhet09> Can I point out that the race wouldn't call themselves leviathan.
[3:21:47] <%Logoth_> Kill everyone ITS THE ONLY WAY
[3:21:47] <%Wallabri> katbamSimply NotLikeThis
[3:21:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I hate this logic "I have to save organics, so I gotta kill ADVANCED organics to prevent Synths from killing all organics" THEN WHY NOT FIGHT AGAINST OTHER GENOCIDAL SYNTHS?
[3:21:49] <%shootbang_exe> wild that casey hudson was allowed to touch projects again after this
[3:21:50] <pmtriox> NO THEY DON'T
[3:21:50] <+WutangchickeN> wutang6BEES wutang6BEES wutang6BEES
[3:21:52] <%AncelDeLambert> PARADOX
[3:21:52] <%DSD24> No?
[3:21:52] <+krispen_wa> THE ONLY FINAL SOLUTION
[3:21:53] <pmtriox> WHAT?
[3:21:57] <duke_of_dozel> Keep the quarian geth conflict in mind this entire time
[3:21:58] <%peachy996> I assume the first true reaper is Harbinger since he sort of leads
[3:21:58] <%redthebaron> this makes no sense
[3:21:58] <@goose_attack_almanac> THATS FUCKIN STUPID
[3:21:58] <%zanz_san> This is so bad
[3:21:58] <Goraka91> Geth exist motherfucker
[3:21:58] <Estwilde> It's a perpetual limbo / stalemate. The only answer an AI has
[3:22:00] <%SinnerEbru> @ErikFeral i always think about that one RTS where the AI figured out the way to solve conflict was to not begin it
[3:22:01] <$ItsRatman> CHAOS

[3:22:20] <%Mekhet09> Yes.

[3:22:20] <+Aeogard> YES
[3:22:20] <%maenos2> YES
[3:22:20] <%greasypete00> probably
[3:22:20] <%DashXero> Likely.
[3:22:20] <ape_hawk> they forgot A LOT
[3:22:20] <%shurtal> ONE WEEKEND
[3:22:21] <%Xevtes> YESSSSSS YES YES YES YES
[3:22:21] <%Treuan> Probably
[3:22:21] <+thetunnelhomer> YUP

[3:22:21] <Archmortal> Yes
[3:22:21] <%Ipsenscastle> seems like it huh
[3:22:21] <$mattynezz> Probably
[3:22:22] <Wolfstriker121> YES!!!!!
[3:22:22] <Alzero83> yes
[3:22:22] <thebalticguy1> IT MAKES NO SENSE
[3:22:22] <%charp35> Yes
[3:22:22] <Hozak> But like, you can't just reset a planet unless you rebury all the metals dug up.
[3:22:22] <pmtriox> 400% THEY DID
[3:22:22] <+toastybites> THEY LITERALLY LOCKED EVERYONE ELSE OUT
[3:22:22] <+7gryphons> definitely
[3:22:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NO THEY DIDN'T
[3:22:22] <Macguffn> Or that EDI exists
[3:22:23] <+krispen_wa> YES
[3:22:23] <%StoopKid241> LUL
[3:22:23] <%afronooch> JUST WAIT

[3:22:24] <%sporeian94> MAC THE HACK WALTERS
[3:22:24] <%bear_breaker20> lmaooooooo
[3:22:24] <Angry_Ev1L> they were too busy ripping shit off
[3:22:24] <kingra> THAT IS ADDRESSED
[3:22:24] <Goraka91> "What's a geth?"
[3:22:24] <@QueequegTheater> Yes
[3:22:25] <prime_name> THEY HAD AN HOUR
[3:22:25] <%shootbang_exe> yeah basically
[3:22:25] <+critikal_bit> Pretty much
[3:22:25] <%peachy996> Prolly
[3:22:25] <Wydamn> what even is being preserved???
[3:22:25] <chancho4tierra> we are buddies with geth and edi
[3:22:25] <LightningLynx89> Yes
[3:22:26] <Wolfstriker121> 100% THEY DID
[3:22:26] <%AncelDeLambert> a paradox a paradox a most ingenious paradox a hahahahaha this paradox
[3:22:26] <+dementedcactus> That’s a completely flawed logic that ignores evolution and education
[3:22:26] <$hattrick61> nah bro it wont last
[3:22:26] <%AmuserName> NAW IT'LL GO BAD SOMEDAY THOUGH LUL
[3:22:26] <%JamesCorck> Casey kinda forgot...
[3:22:26] <tanarath> YES
[3:22:27] <knotsundownsyndrome> @PatStaresAt it was strictly mac that was this bullshit afaik
[3:22:28] <natzo89> First peace in history
[3:22:28] <thebalticguy1> ACT 2 INVALIDATES ACT 3
[3:22:28] <Aeroallways> I feel like this is just a shittly programmed AI stuck in a logic loop
[3:22:28] <iswearimjustdandy> This is reminding me of st discovery in the worst way
[3:22:29] <Archmortal> Fuck.  Casey.  Hudson.
[3:22:29] <%maenos2> THEY FELT THEY WERE BEING DEEP
[3:22:30] <dds333a> maybe LUL
[3:22:31] <+JJJKopf> they panic about leak and ruin the ending
[3:22:31] <beefcakemanthrob> they didn't care
[3:22:34] <James_Quivers> The explaination is that the peace is only temporary and will fail given time
[3:22:34] <crassletter> THE LOCKED THEMSELVES IN A FUCKING ROOM
[3:22:34] <jacobknight13> I think they just didn't care
[3:22:38] <+MagmaRam> They literally just didn't give a shit.
[3:22:39] <Virokwet> idk man
[3:22:40] <%emMmDeeKay> "Well what if people didn't save Rannoch
[3:22:40] <%polothegreatest> the endgame is megaman ZX, cyborgs
[3:22:42] <Archmortal> You can argue they forgot EVERYTHING THAT EVER HAPPENED IN ALL THREE GAMES
[3:22:45] <JetpackMcQuack> they throw away three games for this shit
[3:22:46] <%HeadAsianInCharge> BUT SAD ENDING DEEP THOUGH
[3:22:51] <%willjar313> This fucking bullshit explanation makes me think of that Shinji rant blooper at the end of Evangelion.
[3:22:51] <+haleford> They forgot you could make an Alliance with Synthetic and Quarians as well
[3:22:51] <%kyh9> They humanized the Geth too much in ME2
[3:22:53] <+tomdwarf> I mean, seriously, we brokered serious peace. And worse case scenario, we can just adopt a no interaction policy.
[3:22:55] <+bassoontyphoon> “Danny kind of forgot about the iron fleet”
[3:22:55] <%kyh9> They make Legion too likable
[3:22:55] <%senorpapel> senorpapel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! Hey pat, glad you made it to the choose your color ending. It is awful.       Also got my titania mount a couple weeks ago, gonna try for hades. Extremes are fun
[3:22:56] <pmtriox> they sure do
[3:22:58] <willsin4fun> who decided to make this hologram nigh invisible & keep putting it against similar color backgrounds
[3:22:59] <%strakillias> That questline was probably written AFTER this. And then they didn't redo it
[3:22:59] <$realm_forge> The dark energy plot line would have been so much better
[3:22:59] <%kyh9> And too easy to understand
[3:23:01] <knight_verse> The Reapers made theor decision, BEFORE Rannoch happened in this game....
[3:23:03] <%MooseIsGoose> This is like Brainiac from DC.
[3:23:05] <knotsundownsyndrome> casey hudson wasn't so much as it was mac lol, for context mac was the same catalyst for kai leng integrating as well as this ending being a forethought
[3:23:06] <$lotharrio> Geth, EDI...
[3:23:06] <fusedforms> all this nonsense spoken with the voice of an actual child seems appropriate
[3:23:06] <jtsoppy137> Geth are good bois
[3:23:07] <%kyh9> They fucked up the Geth
[3:23:08] <Brandon__Brando> thay had a day to redo the ending
[3:23:08] <%DrTomT18> The basic jist of this, is that never give an AI a task too complex
[3:23:09] <%AncelDeLambert> the Geth are all you need to disprove this shithead
[3:23:09] <natzo89> Remember the ending changed between ME2 and ME 3
[3:23:09] <%sporeian94> EDI'S EXISTENCE COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS THIS
[3:23:11] <hairtoday> nothing in the game points to this and shepard doesn't argue it
[3:23:12] <JetpackMcQuack> look, it's right there
[3:23:12] <prime_name> UNDONE THE WHOLE THIRD OF A GAME
[3:23:13] <%Solareon_> Solareon_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! its been almost 10 years, and this has somehow gotten even dumber every single time you stop to think about it
[3:23:13] <%DSD24> How
[3:23:14] <%RealThiele> but Legion and EDI are hot shutup casey
[3:23:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck off
[3:23:15] <%Ipsenscastle> the ENTIRE GAME proves the ending is completely asinine
[3:23:16] <duke_of_dozel> Geth are trashed entirely in this ending, considering they die in the destroy ending anyway
[3:23:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> REALLY!?!?
[3:23:17] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:23:18] <%Mekhet09> Cassie hudson is probably the worst writer on the staff and he's the one who's dictating everything.
[3:23:18] <pmtriox> FIRE IS NOT SENTIENT YOU FUCK
[3:23:19] <Goraka91> Fuck off
[3:23:19] <@goose_attack_almanac> FUCK YOU
[3:23:20] <+GingerStrawhat> This was written in like a few days after the ending leak so welcome to very little fact checking
[3:23:21] <@commanderclaw> GOD, THIS IS SO FUCKING STUPID
[3:23:22] <%Logoth_> THEY TAUNT YOU
[3:23:22] <%DSD24> This is stupid
[3:23:22] <Finchit> You are breaking the cycle. You are proving them wrong.
[3:23:22] <jtsoppy137> WUT
[3:23:23] <Brandon__Brando> WHAT?
[3:23:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> FUCK OFF!
[3:23:23] <nuane> wow
[3:23:23] <Meekest> THATS STUPID
[3:23:23] <%sporeian94> GUYS IF YOU START A FOREST FIRE THAT'S NOT CONFLICT
[3:23:23] <+krispen_wa> THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN WAR?!
[3:23:23] <AngryAsian5> FUCK THIS SHIT LUL
[3:23:23] <@goose_attack_almanac> THIS IS SO DUMB

[3:23:25] <kingra> Fuck off
[3:23:25] <topiodonk> oh god
[3:23:26] <Jmann1892> FIRE DOESN'T THINK DUMBASS
[3:23:27] <ape_hawk> NOT INTERESTED IN WAR??? SOVEREIGN LITERALLY THREATENED US!!!!!!
[3:23:27] <$MrWurmles> The Leviathan said that the lesser races were too busy fighting with each other to listen to the Laviathan's race. So THEY created the intelligence to manage the lesser lifeforms. When the AI came to the determination that all organic life vs Artificial life CAN'T coexist, it developed the solution. The Catalyst is implying that the Laviathan's tried to stop this solution, but were too late to stop it. They basically tried sitting the lesser races in front of a TV as a babysitter.
[3:23:27] <%skeletonmilk> LUL
[3:23:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THAT'S NOT THE SAME
[3:23:27] <%machshop> fire is a fucking chemical reactionn
[3:23:28] <prime_name> FUCK YOU
[3:23:28] <Macguffn> Fire isn't a creation!

[3:23:28] <Jaysky> K
[3:23:29] <%ahomeschooldropout> that is so retarded
[3:23:29] <Visorak6> WHAT
[3:23:29] <dds333a> nice example LUL
[3:23:29] <shallaska> americans saying Vietnam wasn't technically a war be like:
[3:23:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> YOU ARE STUPID.
[3:23:30] <SaltyAzteca> WE DIDNT START THE FIRE THOUGH!
[3:23:31] <$MrWurmles> But the TV attacked.
[3:23:31] <ppi1993> IM 14 AND THIS IS DEEP
[3:23:32] <@commanderclaw> FIRE ISN'T SAPIENT
[3:23:32] <%AncelDeLambert> machines are not created to murder their creators on a whim, that's nonsense
[3:23:33] <Valkryna> that's not how fire works fuck you
[3:23:33] <IvanMistwalker> fuck you
[3:23:34] <hairtoday> FIRE DOESN'T HAVE A PROGRAMMED PURPOSE

[3:23:35] <%Piemono> This Robot sucks at Metaphors
[3:23:35] <%maenos2> FUCK YOU CASEY FUCKING HUDSON
[3:23:35] <samuelfisk> That is a super lie
[3:23:35] <%zanz_san> Holy fuck
[3:23:36] <+D00msDayDan> using a child as the mouthpiece is so fucking stupid
[3:23:36] <%justcallmebobplease> I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE, THIS IS OUR PURPOSE
[3:23:36] <+FatherGreyBeard> what the fuck
[3:23:36] <iswearimjustdandy> This is so fucking stupid
[3:23:37] <+krispen_wa> THE CATALYST IS SO CRINGE
[3:23:37] <%MightyDuckShoes> fire doesn't talk shit
[3:23:37] <bearalin> But them being wrong is the point right?
[3:23:38] <lloyddboy> THIS HURTS YOU, PAT
[3:23:40] <%SovPho> fire can't start a conversation
[3:23:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> BULLSHIT IF REAPERS ARE AI, THEY HAVE A CHOICE
[3:23:40] <Sp3ctre48> I think going in the direction that the Quarian's are completely moronic warmongers while the Geth are harmless cute puppies hurt this argument a lot
[3:23:41] <Chatterbox1991> THAT'S NOT HOW NATURE WORKS
[3:23:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck you so fucking much.
[3:23:41] <mr_saturday93> fire is a force... it has no thought
[3:23:41] <%sporeian94> ARSON NOT A CRIME CONFIRMED
[3:23:42] <pmtriox> none of this makes any sennse
[3:23:42] <+Kodkiro> HOW IS IT PERSERVED
[3:23:43] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Fire doesn't try to dab on you via a Zoom call
[3:23:43] <Goraka91> NotLikeThis AAAAAAAAAAA
[3:23:43] <Sigma_190_Beta> Fire isn't sapient.
[3:23:44] <%AncelDeLambert> 12 AND DEEP
[3:23:44] <prime_name> EARTH IS LITERALLY ASHES
[3:23:44] <+krispen_wa> THIS IS CRINGE
[3:23:45] <%studleydoorite> if that's true why have all the Reapers we've seen suck?
[3:23:45] <+toastybites> THAT IS FACTUALLY UNTRUE
[3:23:45] <@commanderclaw> This is some peak ass 13 year old writing
[3:23:46] <morningmoondude> A BUNCH WERE TALKING MAD SHIT DIRECTLY TO SHEPARD
[3:23:46] <%ConLin_Arts_> DansGame
[3:23:47] <shadowstreakXIII> this ending still sucks
[3:23:47] <fusedforms> TIL fire "restores balance"
[3:23:48] <+SilverDevilfish> The robot sounds like a religious nut
[3:23:49] <samuelfisk> Sovereign and Harbinger love to make war on bugs
[3:23:49] <FirewallStorm> fuck you kid
[3:23:49] <duke_of_dozel> Casey must have thought this sounded so cool LMAO
[3:23:49] <+Rofiarf> why is their only one type of reaper than?
[3:23:50] <pmtriox> Babylon 5 was a better ending for ME3
[3:23:50] <crassletter> I WANT THE DARK ENERGY ENDING
[3:23:52] <JetpackMcQuack> FIRE IS AN ASSHOLE
[3:23:53] <Dunmarkh> Is this how NFTs work?
[3:23:54] <HipsterHarbinger> The lazy answer is "the reapers are just a rogue AI so you can't reason with them", but that's unsatisfying
[3:23:55] <+bassoontyphoon> That’s not how fire wooorkkkksss that’s not how anythiinnng worrkkss
[3:23:55] <%bravebravesrobin> I'm at dinner currently for Dads birthday but hope you crush this Cheer500
[3:23:56] <%Bt_Robot> FIRE IS NOT CAPABLE OF CONSCIOUS THOUGHT OR ABLE TO EXIST WITHOUT BURNING
[3:23:56] <$realm_forge> THIS KIDIS JUST SOME ASSHOLE ON TWITTER
[3:23:58] <%polothegreatest> Make him divide by 0
[3:23:58] <bippityjones> I programmed my fire to be wet, take that biiiiiitccccch

[3:23:59] <Goraka91> I'M MAD AGAIN
[3:23:59] <%SovPho> This was written by a 17 year old and that's why I liked it as a 17 year old.
[3:23:59] <metalsiren31> I honestly feel like the only logical takeaway is that the controller AI is actually that stupid
[3:24:01] <%maenos2> THEY WANTED TO BE SO DEEP
[3:24:02] <+rafaelba93> this is dumb
[3:24:02] <%strakillias> Video games need test audiences for shit like this
[3:24:03] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Swap out sythentic to dark energy and this makes way more sense
[3:24:04] <%spitelite> someone thought they were really smart when they wrote this shit

[3:24:43] <%redthebaron> even older than leviathans
[3:24:43] <ctk96> chat is really reminding me of the reactions all those years ago
[3:24:44] <%HaroldDonchee> it was multiple iterations ago so makes sense
[3:24:45] <$lotharrio> This star child is trying to sell you on NFTs.
[3:24:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> YOU ARE LITERALLY SO DUMB.
[3:24:46] <duke_of_dozel> I like that the AI had a sarcastic tone
[3:24:48] <tanarath> WHY DIDN'T THEY BUILD IT THEMSELVES
[3:24:49] <%JoshManVGH> I wonder if it was originally intended to like balance out an overabundance of Dark Evergy
[3:24:50] <+dementedcactus> This is fanfiction now jesus
[3:24:50] <%AncelDeLambert> PARADOX
[3:24:52] <Sp3ctre48> Shepard you're friends with machines, be nice

[3:25:05] <%OrangeMDT> I hate this child voice
[3:25:05] <%Bluwizard21> Fucking retarded replies.
[3:25:06] <%DrTomT18> The only good outcome to this situation is to GET RID OF THIS FUCKING AI. SET THE REAPERS FREE FROM IT
[3:25:08] <ape_hawk> A FINAL SOLUTION
[3:25:08] <%spitelite> then its not a solution
[3:25:09] <+D00msDayDan> a new, more final solution
[3:25:10] <+Hardgames> This is unfathomably terrible
[3:25:10] <+xerotwo> WE DON'T KNOW Kappa
[3:25:11] <Wolfstriker121> ok
[3:25:12] <%RigmaroleHM> A...final solution?

[3:25:18] <dds333a> why, indeed
[3:25:19] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Er, doesn't that mean your solution was garbage from the start?
[3:25:19] <@QueequegTheater> A FINAL ONE, EVEN
[3:25:22] <GizmoKSX> Pray I do not alter it further.
[3:25:23] <jacobknight13> wow you mean you where wrong you dumb space shit?!
[3:25:24] <duke_of_dozel> FamilyMan
[3:25:24] <%DashXero> "could you please just tell the reapers to stop? We'd really appreciate it."

[3:25:43] <Chatterbox1991> PICK DESTROY
[3:25:44] <%WhereIsWill> WHY laynaWHYTHO laynaWHYTHO laynaWHYTHO

[3:25:47] <Darren716> It would be his choice
[3:25:47] <Mattais88> because its what anderson wants
[3:25:47] <%AncelDeLambert> because Anderson is the avatar of the choice
[3:25:48] <Wolfstriker121> NO TIME
[3:25:48] <James_Quivers> Because it's what he wants
[3:25:48] <Sp3ctre48> Cause he represents destroy

[3:25:52] <PinkSocks> what he would've chosen lmao
[3:25:52] <natzo89> makes no sense
[3:25:53] <%YakumoYomi> Because it's what Anderson would choose
[3:25:53] <Dunmarkh> why tho
[3:25:53] <LightningLynx89> Because Anderson wants to destroy the Reapers
[3:25:53] <AlphaRayAllen> GOOD
[3:25:54] <olaksi> don't kill the geth
[3:25:54] <+Kyma1020> Anderson Represents Destroy
[3:25:54] <%secret_npc> because fuck the reapers
[3:25:54] <%JamesCorck> Anderson is Shepard's good side.
[3:25:55] <MrATheGreat> cause anderson belikeves in robo genocide

[3:25:56] <%Jeemukun> YEAH AND WE CAN REBUILD THEM YOU LITTLE SHITLORD
[3:25:56] <+thetunnelhomer> BEST ENDING
[3:25:56] <Junkles> I still believe indoctrination theory
[3:25:57] <%sporeian94> SHEPARD IS FULLY ORGANIC MULTIPLE NPCS CONFIRM THIS
[3:25:57] <huskarl_zap> Destroy is best
[3:25:57] <scrumbotime> not even a real "we're wrong" either just "whuppo I wrong?!"
[3:25:57] <$mattynezz> Anderson-Tim-Saren
[3:25:59] <%akscully> exemplify the choices
[3:25:59] <NewWillinium> Because it is what he would choose]\
[3:26:00] <%JamesCorck> TIM is Shepard's bad side.
[3:26:00] <%AncelDeLambert> mega EMP
[3:26:00] <tanarath> It's what he'd do
[3:26:00] <%skeletonmilk> ??????
[3:26:01] <duke_of_dozel> Anderson wants the reaper destroyed, Illusive Man wants control
[3:26:02] <nuane> fuck anyone with a pacemaker
[3:26:02] <@goose_attack_almanac> WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T ACT. YOU ACTED TO START ALL THIS
[3:26:02] <pmtriox> "I want details" is an insult alsso
[3:26:03] <%Varlinator> So EDI dies & The Geth
[3:26:03] <Brandon__Brando> dont
[3:26:04] <Jaysky> Strayberry, Blueberry, or Watermelon?
[3:26:04] <Archmortal> lying piece of shit child.
[3:26:05] <Darren716> Dont
[3:26:06] <+D00msDayDan> too bad
[3:26:07] <+xerotwo> TRYING Kappa
[3:26:07] <Tracazoid> Shutting down that pacemake
[3:26:07] <%JamesCorck> You are being fair, Pat.
[3:26:07] <prime_name> DON'T
[3:26:08] <+cermo55> kill's all cyborgs?
[3:26:08] <Virokwet> ROJO LOCo
[3:26:08] <%shootbang_exe> aaaaaaaaaand here's why I didn't pick destroy even though it is CLEARLY the option they want you to pick
[3:26:08] <+castlearrrgh> The best Reaper is a dead Reaper
[3:26:09] <Aiutare47> How does plugging the crucible into the citadel reprogram all reapers in existence?
[3:26:09] <@commanderclaw> Don't be
[3:26:09] <richmon__> no dont
[3:26:10] <mr_saturday93> so ppl with cyborg implants will die?
[3:26:10] <+dementedcactus> Oh FUCK THIS
[3:26:12] <willyfreshness> FUCK FAIR THIS IS STUPID
[3:26:12] <Tracazoid> pacemaker*
[3:26:14] <+toastybites> YOU'D THINK A SUPERINTELLIGENCE COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC
[3:26:15] <natzo89> yeah, no sense
[3:26:16] <pmtriox> NO
[3:26:17] <Macguffn> Why try and be fair? Aren't you forgiving to much already?
[3:26:17] <alrobot2014> you're doing a good job at being fair
[3:26:18] <FirewallStorm> dont
[3:26:19] <Mutsu2k> Which super important COLOR will you chose @PatStaresAt ?
[3:26:20] <AllenDeadman> Destroying the crucible literally means killing EDI and all the Geth
[3:26:21] <iswearimjustdandy> Transformers did this better
[3:26:21] <Visorak6> Yes
[3:26:22] <Virokwet> ye
[3:26:22] <+krispen_wa> NO
[3:26:23] <d3ltuhhh> destroy shows anderson because it's what he wanted, control shows TIM because it's what he wanted
[3:26:23] <pmtriox> it means you brought the crucible
[3:26:24] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Anderson wants to destroy them, Illusive Man wants to control them
[3:26:24] <Estwilde> Right
[3:26:24] <+Ardailec> Essentially yes.
[3:26:27] <%redthebaron> then why keep doing it
[3:26:28] <tattleworm> it's very the architect from the matrix
[3:26:28] <%Ipsenscastle> sure
[3:26:28] <+cermo55> All implnts die?\
[3:26:29] <%Varlinator> YES! THANK YOU!
[3:26:29] <%peachy996> Anderson is Red, TIM is Blue, Saren is Green and 4th Option is The Player saying Fuck this ending
[3:26:30] <+mr_miyagucci> I can agree with that
[3:26:31] <$mattynezz> Yup
[3:26:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yes, more Organics will make their way in next time
[3:26:35] <scrumbotime> BUT HOW WOULD THIS MEGAMIND NOT FIGURE OUT THAT IT WAS *POSSIBLE*
[3:26:35] <+D00msDayDan> @Mutsu2k quit wasting your points spamming that already
[3:26:35] <olaksi> no, but they allow the crucible to exist???
[3:26:35] <jacobknight13> yes
[3:26:36] <prime_name> fine
[3:26:36] <@commanderclaw> You're giving this more thought than Casey and Hudson did
[3:26:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also, you have been confirmed not actually partially synthetic.
[3:26:37] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Matrix 3
[3:26:38] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt there are 4 choices not 3 FYI
[3:26:39] <James_Quivers> Yeah that's fine, the cycle is flawed on a big enough scale
[3:26:39] <%ErikFeral> This Ending is the Architect from Matrix Reloaded.
[3:26:40] <Angry_Ev1L> A LITERAL RIP OFF
[3:26:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...
[3:26:41] <tanarath> Yeah, makes sense
[3:26:44] <%valriot> This is essentially Plan B
[3:26:45] <%sporeian94> HE CONTROLS THE REAPERS, HE LITERALLY SAID IT, HE SHOULD JUST STOP THE REPAERS AND HAVE THEM FLY INTO THE SUN!!!!!!
[3:26:45] <+goblinking92> you are putting more thought than the writers did
[3:26:45] <jtsoppy137> why cant the reapers just Fuck off
[3:26:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> By multiple other sources.
[3:26:47] <Sp3ctre48> It will eventually reach this stage again is what it's saying
[3:26:47] <%JoshManVGH> What is "syntheitc life" if Shepard is simply augmented?
[3:26:48] <+Kodkiro> Back to formula
[3:26:48] <JetpackMcQuack> creators have surpassed you, get fucked
[3:26:48] <%dalmek> sure
[3:26:52] <@Ranryu692> Shimon Shepard
[3:26:54] <dawarw0lf> geth would be fine for a while but those quiarns would start shit agaim
[3:26:55] <28moogles> The logic of the AI is fine for a faulty antagonist, it's just the dumb synthetics vs organics stuff that's a problem.
[3:26:55] <willyfreshness> Thicc but
[3:26:55] <%afronooch> Yep
[3:26:56] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[3:26:56] <%RealThiele> oh shit this guy discovered the konami code oh fuck
[3:26:57] <%DXLelouch24> chat Shepard is part synthetic, and he survives high ems devs confirm this. Shitkid is lying dont fall for it
[3:26:58] <dds333a> @macguffn it's good to at least give THIS a chance
[3:26:58] <AllenDeadman> IT SURE IS
[3:26:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yes
[3:27:00] <%willjar313> Nonsense.
[3:27:00] <mr_saturday93> it doesnt make sense that DESTROY means all synth life dies all well as cyborgs but technology in general will be ok?
[3:27:02] <+BeardedLuchador> BOTH
[3:27:02] <$mattynezz> It sure is
[3:27:02] <+bassoontyphoon> Pat… thousands are dying in the background while you talk this theough
[3:27:03] <crassletter> YEP
[3:27:03] <Radioactive_Jam > yep
[3:27:04] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is very badly written
[3:27:04] <Archmortal> It's almost like it's lying to you
[3:27:04] <Tracazoid> Or wrong nonsense
[3:27:05] <%redthebaron> like why can't they just stop doing it
[3:27:05] <+krispen_wa> Yes
[3:27:05] <jacobknight13> yes
[3:27:06] <prime_name> IT SURE IS
[3:27:07] <Parapattern> Shouldn't that also mean they should decommission the entire Reaper plan?
[3:27:09] <JetpackMcQuack> Why are we fighting
[3:27:10] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[3:27:10] <+BeardedLuchador> Wrongsense
[3:27:13] <%WhereIsWill> kojumbo style LUL
[3:27:17] <d3ltuhhh> I literally assumed shepard would die in destroy regardless because of this line LUL
[3:27:17] <%sporeian94> EDI AND JOKER ARE FUCKING!
[3:27:19] <+krispen_wa> NO BUT IT DOESNT COUNT THO
[3:27:20] <nuane> that doesnt count shut up
[3:27:21] <Chatterbox1991> BUT IT CANT LAST PAT
[3:27:21] <$realm_forge> CORRECT
[3:27:21] <%Monkeyweed21> IT WATCHED THE GETH DO NOTHING WRONG
[3:27:22] <olm46> The geth were chill
[3:27:22] <%emMmDeeKay> Occamz Razor determinates that the solutions is that the writers are Hacks
[3:27:25] <AlphaRayAllen> Synthetics and organics can't get along, so I made synthetics to kill organics
[3:27:26] <MrATheGreat> "Your choices matter"
[3:27:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i swear there's a line for that
[3:27:27] <%AncelDeLambert> he's just WRONG, but we're supposed to entertain his mission
[3:27:27] <jacobknight13> he thinks it wont last
[3:27:27] <AllenDeadman> WEIRD
[3:27:27] <Mattais88> YEP
[3:27:27] <jtsoppy137> yeah
[3:27:28] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Because Destroy is what Anderson would do. Also for the love of god DO NOT shoot the boy when you regain control, automatic worst ending
[3:27:28] <FirewallStorm> yep LUL
[3:27:29] <pmtriox> Not only watched, convinced the Geth to attack organics
[3:27:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> YEAH ABOUT THAT
[3:27:29] <Finchit> They don't think it will be permanent.
[3:27:29] <$lotharrio> Yeah. Also, robots can just go live out in space where there's no inhabitable planets. They don't need to like... fight organic life, anywhere.
[3:27:30] <Darren716> That only happened like 2 weeks ago so they couldnt back off then
[3:27:30] <VioletRosefall> and EDI
[3:27:30] <Archmortal> The Geth WERE NEVER AGGRESSORS
[3:27:31] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt The argument is that the peace between them is ONLY TEMPORARY
[3:27:31] <%Cactuskris> yeah but geth is not forever peace in his mind
[3:27:31] <AllenDeadman> ISN'T IT
[3:27:32] <huskarl_zap> SEX BOT
[3:27:32] <%secret_npc> The geth thing might not be new tho
[3:27:32] <ElSuperNova> I CANT DO THAT SHEPARD
[3:27:33] <hairtoday> IT WILL NOT LAST
[3:27:33] <natzo89> @PatStaresAt People have been arguing this for a decade Pat. No one is completely happy with the ending
[3:27:34] <%Fooguwu> Perhaps only a temporary peace treaty
[3:27:34] <kingra> LUL IT WILL NOT LAST THO LUL
[3:27:34] <Goraka91> NAH AI BAD
[3:27:36] <+xerotwo> PEACE WAS NEVER WAS AN OPTION
[3:27:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> SHUT UP THOUGH
[3:27:38] <%ErikFeral> The AI admitted the system isn't working, and is giving you the choice. Give the Ghost Child some credit. Still crap writing, thou
[3:27:39] <jtsoppy137> good bois
[3:27:40] <+Ardailec> And for eons prior. your had people like Javik killing their synthetics
[3:27:41] <mr_saturday93> Consist writing? Whats that?
[3:27:42] <d3ltuhhh> WOW LOOK AT THAT YOU'RE USING YOUR BRAIN!
[3:27:42] <hairtoday> ASK ABOUT IT
[3:27:42] <%afronooch> If SpaceChild was painted to be dishonest it would work a lot better
[3:27:43] <nuane> Self hating AI
[3:27:43] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[3:27:43] <Sigma_190_Beta> EDI AND JOKER ARE FUCKING RIGHT NOW @PatStaresAt THAT ALSO DISPROVES IT!
[3:27:44] <%HaroldDonchee> that was once though. it saw lots of shit happen
[3:27:45] <%SinnerEbru> SHHH PAT DONT THINK TOO HARD
[3:27:45] <Macguffn> An alternate ending opened up by solving the Geth problem peacefully could theoretically work
[3:27:46] <%Aleate> But CHAOS tho
[3:27:47] <%akscully> yeah but the geth killed 99% of the quarians
[3:27:48] <%Varlinator> The kid doesn't know any better. It's assuming the peace won'tlast @PatStaresAt
[3:27:48] <%AncelDeLambert> yep yep yep yep
[3:27:49] <scrumbotime> IT HAPPENED IN FRONT OF THEM
[3:27:49] <Jaysky> SHUTUPSHUTUP
[3:27:50] <lloyddboy> didn't count lmao
[3:27:50] <mikesapartment> you can argue that that's only one example he's observed
[3:27:50] <Chatterbox1991> WELCOME TO 10 YEARS AGO PAT
[3:27:50] <%DrTomT18> 300
[3:27:51] <Estwilde> In the Reapers eyes, that peace is just for a day or two (short term / small scale, irrelevant)
[3:27:51] <chainsaw105> I like to headcanon that the higher the war assets the better calibrated the crucible is so you can just focus the Reapers and not destroy the Geth or yourself
[3:27:51] <natzo89> 10 YEARS PAT!
[3:27:52] <%willjar313> @PatStaresAt I think it's implied that this is the first time something like that happened.
[3:27:54] <Hellarussian> almost like peace was an option
[3:27:57] <James_Quivers> THE REAPERS THINK ON MASSIVE TIME SCALES, THEY DON'T THINK IT WILL LAST
[3:27:58] <+Extrallent> Uncle Tom AI
[3:27:58] <+Kyma1020> it's like someone didn't like people guessed the ending and decided to make some changes
[3:27:58] <bippityjones> But the Israel conflict is ***soooooo*** complicated Pat
[3:27:59] <Sp3ctre48> It's pretty fucked that the best way to end this conflict is to murder the Geth and EDI after all that talk about how Synthetics and Organics can cooexist
[3:27:59] <%ZComiX> YEA BUT THERE IN OTHE CYCLE, the new VARIABLE
[3:28:00] <jacobknight13> also remember edi?
[3:28:00] <+xcompleasedad> No joke, the Geth would have been fine being slaves if they could keep their souls
[3:28:01] <chancho4tierra> he doesnt believe it will hold up
[3:28:01] <willyfreshness> its almost like this is bad writing
[3:28:02] <AluxStreams> This is why people theorize the Starchild is literally lying.
[3:28:02] <knight_verse> NO, He still believes that the Geth and Quarians will go back to being qt war with each other.
[3:28:04] <Archmortal> I'm gonna keep saying it.  Fuck Casey Hudson.
[3:28:05] <MrATheGreat> I believe the game assumes the pllayer fucks the Quarian Geth war
[3:28:07] <hambeerpig> isn't sovereign the one who made the geth aggressors?
[3:28:07] <JetpackMcQuack> is that shepard?
[3:28:08] <%valriot> Yeah, Pat theyre saying organics are too racist to live essentially
[3:28:09] <olaksi> Geth also just want to go hangout in deep space, they are not inherently in conflict over resources or anything with organics
[3:28:09] <richmon__> 10 year neogaf post
[3:28:10] <+The_Death_Owl> synthesize pat,
[3:28:12] <captain_kirkhammer> ooh i got here just in time
[3:28:13] <pipboy344> @chainsaw105 That isn’t headcanon, that’s real
[3:28:13] <AlphaRayAllen> HOW
[3:28:14] <%ZComiX> This cycle is the new variable
[3:28:14] <%ahomeschooldropout> I would've preferred if the ending turned out to be Gurren Lagann and the Reapers were trying to protect the galaxy from the anti-spirals
[3:28:15] <+GingerStrawhat> Again, written in a few days. It dosn't make up for it but it explains a lot about the whole ending
[3:28:15] <jorniev> ALL THE GETH JUST GONE
[3:28:16] <duke_of_dozel> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:28:18] <$mattynezz> All Geth die
[3:28:18] <%AncelDeLambert> "little difficulty" hold onto that thought
[3:28:21] <Jmann1892> The only reason the geth attacked organics is because of Sovereign!
[3:28:22] <ElSuperNova> what's his war assets at?
[3:28:25] <%sporeian94> WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:28:27] <%JoshManVGH> So... it's a fuckoff EMP?
[3:28:27] <duke_of_dozel> Rip the geth
[3:28:28] <pmtriox> NO! DONT PICK THAT
[3:28:29] <%Varlinator> You'd be killing the Geth & EDI Pat

[3:28:32] <Archmortal> FUCK YOU CHILD
[3:28:33] <SaltyAzteca> THATS NOT FOR YOU TO DECIDE
[3:28:33] <$lotharrio> @hambeerpig Yup. The Reapers are the ones that make the Geh aggressive towards organic life.
[3:28:33] <pmtriox> WRONG
[3:28:34] <%DSD24> No it won't
[3:28:34] <Chatterbox1991> CHAOS
[3:28:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> HOW.
[3:28:35] <scrumbotime> Kill Edi and Geth
[3:28:35] <%sporeian94> WRONG!!!!!!!!!!
[3:28:35] <%Fooguwu> So you'll strand every species on earth to starve and die

[3:28:40] <jacobknight13> says you bitch!
[3:28:40] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> honestly, I love the additions.  I'm hoping that the next game has a tighter, more satisfying ending and epilogue.
[3:28:41] <Sigma_190_Beta> SHUT UP!

[3:28:42] <Valkryna> fuck off, child

[3:28:46] <%walternatorz> wait, I thought organic life was the chaos
[3:28:47] <+cermo55> Also EDI
[3:28:47] <+CapFlat> Didn't this originally have him saying that they COULDN'T repair the damage, dooming the other races that were now stuck here because they cou;dn't eat human food?
[3:28:47] <%peachy996> Blue.
[3:28:47] <+bassoontyphoon> KILL CHAOS

[3:28:56] <%ScreamLord> I also don't believe the Geth actually get killed by the Red ending
[3:28:56] <Kivros> the catalyst is just a dumb vi

[3:30:21] <%bear_breaker20> also true for thousands of colonies\
[3:30:21] <alrobot2014> I never even played Arrival and there's still the problems of these fuckers being stranded
[3:30:21] <ShiningAxis> Yes, everyone pointed that out too
[3:30:21] <+JonathLP> TALI AND GARRUS
[3:30:22] <%HeadAsianInCharge> pretty much
[3:30:22] <duke_of_dozel> trapped forever
[3:30:22] <%MooseIsGoose> And none of them can get back home
[3:30:23] <%emMmDeeKay> I CAN'T WAIT FOR THePODCAST tomorrow is going to be FUN
[3:30:23] <tanarath> Y E S
[3:30:24] <prime_name> IT GETS WORSE
[3:30:25] <%sporeian94> THE KROGAN WOULD WIN
[3:30:25] <%RealThiele> colonies fucked
[3:30:25] <$lotharrio> Sorry Tali and Garrus.

[3:30:26] <%AmuserName> STARVATION ABSURDITY
[3:30:26] <%Monkeyweed21> STOP THINKING ABOUT IT MORE THAN THE WRITER
[3:30:26] <$realm_forge> CORRECT
[3:30:26] <Conscript_Gary> the fact that Picard ripped this off is fucking ridiculous
[3:30:28] <%ScreamLord> Or eat each other
[3:30:29] <d3ltuhhh> krogans beat the shit out of everyone
[3:30:29] <GuyNamedGatsby> Remember Pat, this is the ending they thought would be better than one that was leaked.
[3:30:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> The point is that Trillions dead anyway
[3:30:32] <Chatterbox1991> YES
[3:30:32] <hairtoday> RANNOCH AND TUCHANKA DIDN'T MATTER
[3:30:33] <%sporeian94> THE YAHG WOULD LITERALLY CONQUER THE GALAXY
[3:30:33] <MrATheGreat> Their sacrifices are appreciated
[3:30:35] <GizmoKSX> They break about NOW in the Extended Cut. Original ending, yeah, they blow up.
[3:30:35] <Hemmy99> I forgot about the food problem
[3:30:35] <pmtriox> Pat you are repeating literally everything from 2012 verbattum
[3:30:35] <+Tredecian> quarians might have farms
[3:30:36] <%AncelDeLambert> this is true
[3:30:36] <%akscully> asari are the only ones who can live
[3:30:37] <%cvp5127> batarians live?
[3:30:39] <tanarath> No
[3:30:39] <%kyh9> The krogans would also almost assuredyly MURDER everyone on Earth
[3:30:40] <Mahbonk> No breeding pogonaSad
[3:30:40] <+ALazo> krogans live forever though
[3:30:41] <kingra> REXX AND TALI ARE DEAD BibleThump
[3:30:41] <%emMmDeeKay> The KROGAN on tuchanka Win and takeover the galaxy
[3:30:41] <natzo89> WELCOME TO 2012 PAT
[3:30:42] <jacobknight13> quarian live ships might have some food
[3:30:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> @PatStaresAt They don't actually show them blowing up, they show the galaxy map and energy waves "radiating out" from relay systems
[3:30:43] <scrumbotime> "You can destroy the reapers, but you'll kill pretty much everyone"
[3:30:44] <%SinnerEbru> DONT THINK HARDER THAN THE WRITERS DID PAT
[3:30:44] <Chatterbox1991> YAHG RISE UP
[3:30:45] <Sp3ctre48> @pipboy344 The relays do blow up in the original ending
[3:30:46] <%Ipsenscastle> @Conscript_Gary that's the saddest thing of all LUL
[3:30:47] <%kyh9> The Asari would take over basically
[3:30:47] <+xcompleasedad> I forgot about the females bit LUL
[3:30:47] <%bread_assassin> But the citadel is here.
[3:30:48] <+Rofiarf> so just humans and asari i guess
[3:30:48] <pmtriox> in the same order of thoughts
[3:30:48] <+cermo55> Krogan would live long enough for relays to be repaired
[3:30:49] <%Varlinator> You'll see
[3:30:49] <+Crimsonpajamas > Won't the Quarians die because their suits will stop working?
[3:30:51] <%RealThiele> Quarians do have their NUT ships
[3:30:51] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt You are reiterating 2012 talking points
[3:30:51] <Darren716> Stop asking perfectly logical questions
[3:30:52] <%willjar313> It's almost like this ending was poorly thought out or something...
[3:30:52] <%TheAdMerlin> Quarians have farms with food Turians can eat
[3:30:53] <%DashXero> This is a fuckin' mess.
[3:30:53] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the rewrite done over the course of 1 day done out of spite just to please Casey's ego
[3:30:53] <%maenos2> asari take over
[3:30:54] <Sigma_190_Beta> YAHG WOULD CONQUER THE GALAXY @PatStaresAt
[3:30:55] <%ahomeschooldropout> asari would be fine tho
[3:30:55] <jorniev> WOULDNT GETH FUCKING  DIE IN THE DESTROY ENDING?
[3:30:56] <+mr_miyagucci> Krogans live long enough that they would probably be fine tbh
[3:30:58] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt It's like it's poorly written or something
[3:30:58] <%AncelDeLambert> HORSESHIT
[3:30:58] <%bear_breaker20> nothing to stop the rannoch again
[3:31:01] <oda_flobunaga> Star Trek thought this was a Good thing to rip off LUL
[3:31:02] <%Laecerelius> Yeah the Quarians DID bring their live ships which might have farming or whatever on them
[3:31:02] <+ALazo> become shepgod
[3:31:02] <Angry_Ev1L> SOUNDS GOOD TO ME
[3:31:02] <Archmortal> Shepard becomes Reaper Goo
[3:31:03] <olm46> So not dead at all
[3:31:03] <duke_of_dozel> CORPOREAL
[3:31:03] <tanarath> Nah, Krogans would survive
[3:31:04] <knight_verse> THEY CAN FIX THEM... THRY LITERALLY SPENT THOUSANDS OF YEARS MAINTAINING THEM
[3:31:04] <%skeletonmilk> FUCKING STUPID
[3:31:05] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Worse the galaxy requires a galactic supply chain to support there populations there would be mass death just from that
[3:31:06] <+MEGACHAMPtv> plot hole the game : featuring no final battle
[3:31:07] <Aiutare47> Literally become god
[3:31:07] <Mattais88> SPACE GHOST COAST TO COAST

[3:31:24] <Sp3ctre48> This choice is stupid though, even if TIM was right, why listen to the dumb thing he was trying to do, it's not like controlling the Reapers is any better just because he's not doing it

[3:38:53] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah but that's still destroying their current civilization, they're supposed to be alive now right???
[3:38:53] <+OneGorillionDollars> because the game says so

[3:38:56] <%Mekhet09> Blue is actually the least awful ending.
[3:38:56] <olaksi> geth have had centuries of self-evolution, they are gone forever
[3:38:57] <Mattais88> Back them up from the last update
[3:38:57] <TioXyco> you can also fuck the quarians that were being helped by the geth
[3:38:57] <Botman_R> I THINK YOU'RE ON A TIMER
[3:38:58] <%shadowsofpain> no because they ate their experiences
[3:38:58] <%ScrapKingKeita> The Reaper advancements on the Geth AI is something that they'd lose
[3:38:58] <BrOOnoh> doit
[3:38:59] <%strakillias> Couldn't you just reboot edi?
[3:38:59] <%SovPho> Didn't they gain sapience from a bug
[3:38:59] <%sunsetdisc0> theoretically all the synthetics could be saved on a backup drive
[3:38:59] <Wolfstriker121> GETH 2 THE GETHING
[3:38:59] <%HaroldDonchee> WHOS GOING TO REMAKE THEM? THE QUARIANS?

[3:39:02] <Estwilde> It wouldn't be the Geth, it'd be something different
[3:39:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they got sapience through the Reaper Code
[3:39:03] <Sarah_UwU_> Go Go

[3:39:04] <Paragon_of_Laziness> everybody will magically forget how to make robots
[3:39:04] <+The_Death_Owl> aren't the plans electronic?
[3:39:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> but as a collective, the existing ones die out, and they may not be rebuilt
[3:39:04] <bippityjones> Yes walk closer to the explosion while shooting it, that'll make you shoot better

[3:39:06] <%kyh9> NO, THATS NOT HOW THAT WORKS
[3:39:06] <$hattrick61> you can rebuild the geth and i think edi would be ok with sacrificing herself
[3:39:06] <tanarath> The geth have reaper upgrades
[3:39:06] <Ravioli_Ronin> HARD DEAD

[3:40:21] <%RealThiele> BEEEEEEEM
[3:40:21] <Wydamn> it's not even a huge explosion, he would have been fine if he just walked the other way
[3:40:23] <GizmoKSX> Cool guys don't look at explosions. Shepard walks into the thing.
[3:40:24] <GoatArmageddon> "Guess I'll die"
[3:40:24] <%MugenSandan> RED
[3:40:25] <MrATheGreat> Cause Shep would rather die with all the robots
[3:40:29] <@QueequegTheater> @ScatterCatt not will maxed out war assets he doesn't
[3:40:30] <d3ltuhhh> at least this music is good
[3:40:30] <Ravioli_Ronin> Oh just wait for the post credit scene

[3:40:31] <+bugz_munny> reeeeeeed
[3:40:32] <%pokefan9956> COLORS
[3:40:32] <olaksi> Tali is probably dead too because of the suit tech
[3:40:33] <chainsaw105> I like low asset Destroy where you literally wipe out all life in the galaxy
[3:40:33] <linSP> HE PICKED CHARIZARD?
[3:40:33] <%peachy996> BIG RED
[3:40:34] <%Maids4lyfe> ALL BIOTICS DIE BECAUSE THEY HAVE IMPLANTS
[3:40:34] <Jaysky> KOOLAID
[3:40:35] <%ErikFeral> It don't matter. None of this mattered.
[3:40:35] <Estwilde> @PatStaresAt You're dying anyway being part synthetic
[3:40:35] <JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis
[3:40:35] <PinkSocks> red
[3:40:35] <willyfreshness> BASED ENDING
[3:40:37] <%JamesCorck> Now the whole galaxy is gingers.
[3:40:39] <+bassoontyphoon> Red red red red
[3:40:39] <+thehotrefrigerator> Does this option destroy the Mass Relays?
[3:40:39] <+Extrallent> @cooldude69xx yeah but any new geth would know that the galaxy jlhas no issue with sacrificing them when its better for them
[3:40:40] <pmtriox> not even game of thrones is as awful as this man
[3:40:41] <Macguffn> Red space magic
[3:40:41] <Zeif00> LUL
[3:40:41] <%ahomeschooldropout> Best ending is when you shoot the star kid and you get the "everyone died lol" ending
[3:40:41] <+lucaflowe> Pat this is literally the second worse ending lmao
[3:40:42] <MaybeFalco> RED
[3:40:44] <%Varlinator> DIE REAPERS DIE
[3:40:45] <Brandon__Brando> this ost was wasted
[3:40:45] <SaintlyToa> because upset shepard
[3:40:47] <%Aleate> Good thing the Normandy is so FAST it can outrun everything. Except the pain.
[3:40:47] <huskarl_zap> GENDER REVEAL
[3:40:49] <%Fooguwu> Literally the bad ending
[3:40:49] <%cvp5127> its orange Kappa
[3:40:49] <%JoshManVGH> Are... reapers unable to FTL?
[3:40:50] <%emMmDeeKay> Oh look at them OUTRUNING THE WAVE
[3:40:51] <+thetunnelhomer> Time to play "Which was added in the extended cut"
[3:40:52] <AngryAsian5> Why would the Reapers even design that thing to be shot/broken anyway?
[3:40:53] <+goblinking92> we saved the galaxy Patrick
[3:40:53] <Wydamn> And so Kai Leng retroactively becomes cooler than Shepard.
[3:40:53] <%Ipsenscastle> Fundamentally the problem with ME3 is that they give you a choice for the ending, instead of having it be a consequence
[3:40:53] <brandt_connors> this is extended footage
[3:40:53] <+The_Death_Owl> wait so does that mean disabled people with implants got killed too?
[3:40:55] <jorniev> PAT CHOOOSE COLOR RED
[3:40:55] <scrumbotime> ..... oh yeah biotics would just have their brain shit fry
[3:40:55] <+dekkless> Legion died for nothing
[3:40:58] <dawarw0lf> man I don't like this ending at all
[3:40:58] <%Laecerelius> SHHHHH
[3:40:58] <%RealThiele> MONEE
[3:40:59] <Arqartur0> Well... I thought it was gonna be God-Emperor Shepard, but I guess is Horus Heresy-Shepard?
[3:41:00] <morningmoondude> The good ending
[3:41:00] <%sporeian94> THE CITADEL BLEW UP BTW AND CRASHED INTO EARTH CLEARLY SO EVERYONE IN LONDON AND THE CITADEL IS DEAD
[3:41:00] <%bravebravesrobin> NO SYNTHESIS 😭😭😭😭
[3:41:00] <+D00msDayDan> aw yeah we prerendered now
[3:41:01] <Angry_Ev1L> this is david cage tier bullshit
[3:41:01] <%Laecerelius> IT'S FINE
[3:41:01] <Sp3ctre48> If you have low ems the destroy ending just incinerates everyone
[3:41:02] <+ItalianWaifu> Shepard dindn't want to live in a world without Robussy in it
[3:41:02] <Dunmarkh> THIS GAME IS SHIT
[3:41:02] <%peachy996> SHUT UP
[3:41:02] <%Faustgesicht> any scenes that don't have the crucible in them were added later
[3:41:04] <Hellarussian> lag
[3:41:05] <%SinnerEbru> god these cutscenes are Extra corny
[3:41:05] <%cooldude69xx> @Extrallent They already still like the Quarians, I dont see the issue
[3:41:06] <@Lion_kun> There are only three endings so saying second worst ending is like saying second best lol
[3:41:06] <$lotharrio> Drama
[3:41:07] <ctk96> post credits don't exist anymore guys remember, extended cut got rid of it
[3:41:07] <Darren716> Legit destroy is the only good ending, especially with max readiness
[3:41:08] <Ids560> Red is for sure the least Immoral even if it killed everyone that gets stranded
[3:41:08] <prime_name> SHSHSHSH
[3:41:08] <Conscript_Gary> BIG BEN
[3:41:08] <%TheWinged7> fuck you, no consistency
[3:41:09] <@Ranryu692> other side of the planet?
[3:41:09] <storm_odst> Most of this is extended
[3:41:10] <ElSuperNova> EoE is miles above this, the comparison is an insult
[3:41:10] <%barrakuta371> I can't believe but can also believe Pat picked the red pilled choice
[3:41:11] <GizmoKSX> Logistics
[3:41:11] <%Mekhet09> This would destroy 80% of the world.
[3:41:12] <MrATheGreat> it's a little latye
[3:41:12] <SaltyAzteca> Tumbling down tumbling down tumbling dooooooooown~
[3:41:13] <%peachy996> NOOOO BIG BEN
[3:41:14] <AlphaRayAllen> Okay buy Big Ben is alright
[3:41:16] <$realm_forge> PACKET LOSS
[3:41:16] <ChungusQuest> So long final record of all galactic civilizations to have ever existed
[3:41:16] <+itsKrisD> ALL BIOTICS DEAD
[3:41:19] <%akscully> old ben doesn't work anymore lol
[3:41:20] <tanarath> The Citadel was in space? dunno
[3:41:20] <%lilytastic> those don't look very destroyed
[3:41:22] <%cooldude69xx> This would take hundreds of years to spread at the rate it ws going
[3:41:23] <@QueequegTheater> @Lion_kun *4 endings
[3:41:23] <willsin4fun> how does this pulse distinguish "synthetic life" apart from like, any kind of electric appliance. Like a toaster. or a spaceship
[3:41:23] <%Cactuskris> EDF EDF
[3:41:24] <RetributionP> very bad choice
[3:41:25] <Archmortal> Everyone with a pacemaker?  Dead.
[3:41:27] <+titansloth93> WE SAVED THE PLANET
[3:41:27] <%Fooguwu> TALI IS DEAD
[3:41:27] <olaksi> BILLION DEAD
[3:41:28] <%Varlinator> BIG FUCKIN' BEN SURVIVED YEAH!!!!
[3:41:30] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Both EDI became fully sentient with reaper tech they can never be rebuilt the same even with blueprints
[3:41:30] <Macguffn> Congratulations on killing trillions of years of history and culture
[3:41:30] <%GarbageNirvana> So it's a massive EMP blast
[3:41:31] <%SinnerEbru> @ElSuperNova yeah its rude to anno to compare this shit to EoE
[3:41:33] <%machshop> all it did was turn them off, we can totally just salvage the shit
[3:41:33] <Wydamn> !SANITY AT RISK!
[3:41:33] <willyfreshness> STEEEVE
[3:41:34] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt That stupid crucible thing said it controlled the reapers. It literally could have just  turned the reapers off or commanded them to self destruct rather than some stupid ai only pulse wave thing that makes no sense
[3:41:34] <chainsaw105> @PatStaresAt you should look up the low war asset Destroy ending after this
[3:41:34] <%Jeemukun> GET FUCKED YA SQUID FACED BASTARDS
[3:41:35] <+thetunnelhomer> Added scene
[3:41:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Hooraaaay, we've all returned to the Stone Age!
[3:41:36] <%sporeian94> SYNTHESIS IS FUNNY BECAUSE ALL THE HUSKS ARE ALIVE AND SENTIENT IN THIS CUTSCENE
[3:41:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Which means everyone's back in the stone age
[3:41:38] <mr_saturday93> I would like to point out it your ML isnt high enough everyone else will die to for some reason
[3:41:39] <Darren716> Man look at all these memorable characters
[3:41:40] <sownsky> How do you think the game should have satisfyingly ended if you mostly did a paragon play through with everyone living. (None of the original endings are good, I’m still suffering from PTSD)
[3:41:40] <thelonechris> "We did it Patrick! We saved the city!"
[3:41:40] <%maenos2> you know, there's a lot of reaper tech left behind...
[3:41:41] <natzo89> some survived the entire war only to get got crushed by a dying reaper
[3:41:42] <%afronooch> having a implant doesnt make you a geth chat
[3:41:42] <%cvp5127> how man
[3:41:43] <%peachy996> Synthesis makes this so fucked up
[3:41:44] <+castlearrrgh> all of earth looks like new jersey now. oh well
[3:41:45] <%akscully> sucks
[3:41:45] <ElSuperNova> TIME FOR EXTENDED CUT
[3:41:46] <@Lion_kun> As far as I know there's only red, blue and green, is there a secret fourth color ending?
[3:41:47] <+MagmaRam> Dying on Nov. 11, 1918
[3:41:47] <%ErikFeral> We did it, Patrick! We saved the city!!
[3:41:47] <%Varlinator> LUL
[3:41:48] <MrATheGreat> Now, what determines a synthetic to this red light? Is a computer a synth to it?
[3:41:49] <+BeardedLuchador> Imagine the guy with the pacemaker that died when the wave hits you
[3:41:50] <+D00msDayDan> destroys all technology but their guns are fine
[3:41:50] <%MightyDuckShoes> my pacemaker!!!
[3:41:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> That would suck so hard
[3:41:51] <KeystoneA2> That's war for you
[3:41:51] <%walternatorz> total bummer
[3:41:53] <makatu84> TRAILER GUY

[3:41:57] <%peachy996> The SKY
[3:41:57] <$mattynezz> Imagine being someone that a Reaper fell on as it died
[3:41:57] <Radioactive_Jam > I'd be too dead to care
[3:41:58] <$realm_forge> GRANDMAW’S PACEMAKER WENT POOF
[3:41:59] <Tracazoid> *Dies to piece of metal flung BY the wave*

[3:42:04] <quipquest1> Well, it's not like you would know it
[3:42:05] <willyfreshness> So many added scenes
[3:42:06] <Finchit> Fourth ending is denying the choices
[3:42:06] <VirtualMode> is it ogre
[3:42:06] <%bevyrage> can't be a bummer if you died tbqh
[3:42:06] <%SpcOpsBear> @castlearrrgh As a new jersey resident, I can confirm this is 100% fact.
[3:42:07] <morningmoondude> Shooting hte kid unlocks the 4th ending
[3:42:07] <%greasypete00> the fucking sun had better not come out literally right after the reapers die
[3:42:07] <%WhereIsWill> war, war has changed
[3:42:08] <Jaysky> @lion_kun Shooting the child, yes
[3:42:08] <+itsKrisD> BYE CITADEL

[3:42:08] <chancho4tierra> all this sucks and i dont like it one bit
[3:42:09] <Hemmy99> That’s a common sentiment in most wars
[3:42:11] <@Spydurman> does this kill all Quarians cause of the suits?
[3:42:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Lion_kun refuse all choices/shoot child, everyone dies the end
[3:42:12] <hairtoday> there goes the citadel

[3:42:37] <%Mekhet09> ALL DEAD
[3:42:37] <%ZephynM> ResidentSleeper
[3:42:38] <Finchit> Quarian suits are fucked too

[3:42:40] <+D00msDayDan> i love that shot of the mass relay network
[3:42:40] <+OneGorillionDollars> Imagine all the ships that would just create an artificial meteor shower and WRECK earth
[3:42:41] <Wydamn> THOSE ARE BIGGER THAN SUPERNOVAS
[3:42:41] <+xcompleasedad> Is this energy fucking FTL????????
[3:42:42] <%SinnerEbru> ALL INTERNAL TECHNOLOGY, YOURE ALL DEAD
[3:42:42] <Archmortal> Casey didn't account for differences.  Shepard should have died no matter what by the Catalyst's logic
[3:42:42] <Hellarussian> millions dead
[3:42:43] <$sleepystardewfarmer> he is the ideal mixture
[3:42:46] <%sniffy77> how can it tell the difference between synthetic life and metal with a charge
[3:42:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> ALL CYBERNETIC IMPLANTS ARE GONE!
[3:42:46] <JetpackMcQuack> catastrophic
[3:42:47] <socratetris> Seems like some inefficient pathing for that galaxy lazer
[3:42:47] <jacobknight13> and everyone died!!!
[3:42:47] <@QueequegTheater> The music is legit great though
[3:42:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> RED RED RED

[3:42:50] <Goraka91> ALMOST DEAD
[3:42:51] <%cvp5127> billions stranded
[3:42:51] <AngryAsian5> Like, would the destroy ending also simultaneously destroy every possible back-up an AI could have too? Like does it brick hard-drives? LUL
[3:42:52] <HipsterHarbinger> We had to do it Pat. Your dad was going to rise up and destroy the universe
[3:42:53] <AlphaRayAllen> Look at all these SIMPLE REPAIRS
[3:42:53] <+ALazo> just imagine galaxy wide super emp frying everything
[3:42:53] <BrOOnoh> who even care at this point
[3:42:54] <d3ltuhhh> @Spydurman no, tali doesn't get automatically killed through this ending so I would assume all the others are the same
[3:42:54] <%peachy996> The extra scenes
[3:42:54] <%sporeian94> THIS IS ALL EC BTW BECAUSE IN THE OG THE NORMANDY JUST CRASHSES AND IT CUTS TO CREDITS
[3:42:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Any artificially progressed life is apparently synthetic if shepard is effected
[3:42:55] <Darren716> @PatStaresAt They say that Shepard's implants count so a pacemaker would I imagine
[3:42:55] <%machshop> i thought it was gonna land on them lmao
[3:42:55] <+BeardedLuchador> SPACE MAGIC
[3:42:55] <ctk96> they said all tech would malfunction and people would have to repair it
[3:42:55] <Mattais88> Guns still work though, so who knows
[3:42:55] <+lucaflowe> PAT IT'S ALL ELECTRONICS THE KID EVEN SAID IT WON'T PICK AND CHOOSE IT'LL FUCK EVERYTHING
[3:42:57] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, thats a decent question. What about things like clones or replicants? Or Grunt?
[3:42:57] <natzo89> so are people with peg legs
[3:42:59] <+JonathLP> All cyborgs die as well
[3:43:00] <%Wallabri> i want to feel an emotion but lord this is so silly
[3:43:01] <jorniev> WHY IS SYNTHESIS CANON?
[3:43:01] <willsin4fun> why did the husks get turned to dust but the reapers just fall over
[3:43:01] <%RealThiele> flattened by a reaper as they die
[3:43:02] <+toastybites> ANDROMEDA MAKES THIS ENDING EVEN WORSE
[3:43:02] <%bread_assassin> What if it just fell on them?
[3:43:02] <%Laecerelius> THE REAPERS FALLING OVER IS FUCKING HILARIOUS
[3:43:04] <samuelfisk> What if you just have a prosthetic limb? Or a hearing implant?
[3:43:04] <%Bt_Robot> ANYTHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN A CALCULATOR IS DESTROYED
[3:43:05] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah these planet scenes are new
[3:43:06] <dds333a> YEAH
[3:43:06] <RetributionP> you super killed everyone pat
[3:43:06] <Estwilde> Most humanoids are dead too having synthetic implants
[3:43:06] <%ZComiX> You justvEMPed everyone. Red is ALL TECH
[3:43:06] <+RyTYoung> woo we did the thing
[3:43:07] <willyfreshness> No scenes for how bad you FUCK the geth?
[3:43:08] <+dementedcactus> Highest KDA ever?
[3:43:08] <%MightyDuckShoes> does  the idea that the getb and Edi have higher sapience somehow make them immune though? the geth have like a biorobo cell
[3:43:09] <Augus7717> @PatStaresAt imagine if the wave comes and the reaper just fucking falls on you LUL
[3:43:09] <UrsaPyro> Imagine being the guy who gets crushed by a giant robot just after the wave hits
[3:43:09] <%greasypete00> what if you got killed by launched debris from a dead  reaper
[3:43:10] <+thehotrefrigerator> "YEAH US ALIENS ARE NOW STUCK ON EARTH"
[3:43:10] <%ScreamLord> Oh wait
[3:43:11] <%DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt Shepard is part synthetic and lives so it doesnt matter cause its obvious Shitkid lied
[3:43:11] <+FoolsArcade> Bye bye mass effect fields I guess
[3:43:12] <%bravebravesrobin> Pat still commits genocide Cheer500
[3:43:12] <Radioactive_Jam > some poor guy def got crushed under a dying reaper
[3:43:13] <$lotharrio> Shep's implants were enough to kill him. Presumably your dad's heart explodes.
[3:43:13] <+bugz_munny> all these places suck
[3:43:14] <%lilytastic> you could just cut to this after dying next to Anderson..
[3:43:14] <%Fooguwu> Trillions dead good job pat
[3:43:15] <%EthorXL> EthorXL subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Glad I could catch the bad ending stream!~
[3:43:15] <+RJay80> The Color Red Wins
[3:43:16] <pipboy344> @lion_kun No, Extended Cut added a fourth ending where if you shoot the child, he gets pissed, nothing changes, everything is wiped out, and a new civilization finds a time capsule from Liara
[3:43:16] <%spitelite> is that detroit
[3:43:17] <%strakillias> Reminder that is what Tuchanka looked like before
[3:43:18] <+ItalianWaifu> thats our rock damn it
[3:43:19] <%AncelDeLambert> This should include every single Biotic, as they are all cyborgs to a degree. The Asari should ALL be dead
[3:43:19] <MrATheGreat> Btw @PatStaresAt You might as well check the 4th ending out because it reads as a mass middle finger to whoever complained about the other endings, at least to me
[3:43:20] <olaksi> yeah this is still an apocalyptic event
[3:43:21] <$mattynezz> We saved the City!
[3:43:21] <brandt_connors> SurKesh was nice

[3:44:54] <%cooldude69xx> This reminded me that the Penny Arcade guys thought Synthesis was the best ending
[3:44:54] <alrobot2014> they had to add the scene where harbinger just doesn't shoot the normandy to explain how your squadmates end up in this shot iirc
[3:44:54] <ctk96> that food thing was dumb why couldn't they just plant food?
[3:44:55] <jkfd> the circuitry ending is objectively the morally least reprehensible option. only a soft genocide
[3:44:55] <%emMmDeeKay> Well Tali is dead
[3:44:56] <iswearimjustdandy> The other ending is nightmare fiel
[3:44:56] <roughday25> was Joker the protagonist the whole time?

[3:45:03] <@Lion_kun> As we all know, Mass Effect was all about Joker motorboating EVE's thicc ass.
[3:45:03] <+mr_miyagucci> if there was not an ending choice and you just killed the reapers or lost the inconsistencies and stupid  plotholes would be far less numerous
[3:45:04] <Wolfstriker121> I KNOW RIGHT

[3:51:22] <%LittleCinders> This ending is so freaking BAD they all are .
[3:51:23] <+HaunchPaunch> they wanted that ending to be canon for more Shepard.
[3:51:24] <nuane> you cant update a bad game into being good

[3:51:34] <+GingerStrawhat> Hey hey welcome to the Pain club your now a member Pat
[3:51:35] <+Tredecian> MAURADER SHIELDS TRIED TO PROTECT US ALL
[3:51:35] <dawarw0lf> other endings are better imo
[3:51:36] <%Faustgesicht> Chest rise was the post credits tho
[3:51:37] <%senorpapel> Og ending is just a color swap
[3:51:37] <Sol_Install> F to Maurader shield! The hero that try to save us!
[3:51:38] <mysteriousmistermystery> And they let the moron who wrote this MAKE ANDROMEDA
[3:51:39] <%DashXero> Why is Pat not allowed to watch the post-credits?
[3:51:39] <quipquest1> How is there a game after this?
[3:51:41] <%SinnerEbru> marauder shields tried to protect you u__u
[3:51:42] <pmtriox> worse than game of thrones?
[3:51:43] <dds333a> o7
[3:51:44] <natzo89> kai leng
[3:51:44] <%sporeian94> ALSO THAT'S THE CANON ENDING BTW.
[3:51:44] <+cermo55> citadel
[3:51:45] <%Ipsenscastle> literally all of the endings feel like a betrayal of the themes
[3:51:45] <ayatollahofroggenrola> The Citadel started blowing up even if Shepard survived that how would there be oxygen
[3:51:45] <LightningLynx89> Marauder Shields tried to stop you Pat
[3:51:45] <%willjar313> The highlight of this ending is Marauder Shield.
[3:51:47] <Darren716> Yeah dont spoil this shit for Wooli
[3:51:47] <%JamesCorck> I sure hope Woolie plays it!!!
[3:51:47] <+D00msDayDan> Marauder Shields should be credited
[3:51:47] <+thetunnelhomer> Woolie should never play these games
[3:51:47] <rytisone> tell Woolie about the party
[3:51:47] <+SmigGames> other than it's bad
[3:51:50] <Sigma_190_Beta> The other endings are just better.
[3:51:50] <cthulu_fearlock> corpse
[3:51:50] <%JoshManVGH> So are VI's dead?
[3:51:50] <+krispen_wa> Kai "Pussy" Lang?
[3:51:51] <Jmann1892> Should of done Citadel last
[3:51:52] <Mattais88> How good Citadel is
[3:51:52] <%AmuserName> WELCOME TO THE PAIN OF 2012. A WOUND RE-OPENED AFTER A DECADE.
[3:51:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[3:51:53] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This is your Game of Thrones
[3:51:54] <Alzero83> Indoctrination Theory Is Still the Canon
[3:51:57] <%akscully> it ends with citadel
[3:51:57] <%DrTomT18> THEY FIXED NOTHING
[3:51:58] <Wolfstriker121> its the cannon ending
[3:51:58] <%DXLelouch24> Make Woolie suffer this
[3:52:00] <%afronooch> Destroy kinda has to be canon for ME
[3:52:00] <%DXLelouch24> DO IT
[3:52:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> F in the chat for marauder shields, he tried to stop this
[3:52:00] <@goose_attack_almanac> It should be mentioned that Sheperd is still dead even with that dumb breath at the end since he's been in rubble and everyone else thinks he is dead. No one seems to have recovered the body.
[3:52:01] <thebalticguy1> talk citadel
[3:52:01] <%afronooch> 4
[3:52:01] <AlphaRayAllen> I'm annoyed that the villain was literally right
[3:52:03] <metalsiren31> It's crazy how hard this game falls apart after Rannoch
[3:52:03] <pipboy344> The fuck you mean not allowed?
[3:52:03] <supergoblinpunch> I've seen people defend the ending.
[3:52:04] <%lomack42> wait buzz aldrin was in those credits
[3:52:04] <%sporeian94> AN ENDING SO BAD THEY HAD TO MAKE THE SEQUEL IN AN ENTIRELY NEW GALAXY
[3:52:04] <Parapattern> Where did the Illusive Man COME FROM?
[3:52:04] <%sunsetdisc0> JESSICE CHOBOT CAME UP IN THE CREDITS BEFORE KEITH GODDAM DAVID
[3:52:05] <Arqartur0> Honestly I thought it was gonna be God-Emperor Shepard with him joining the Necrons
[3:52:05] <+justicevi4> now you know why Marauder shields is such a OG meme
[3:52:05] <%hereiam407> Just disappear
[3:52:06] <$realm_forge> Please share your correct observations
[3:52:06] <%Monkeyweed21> MARAUDER SHIELDS WAS TRYING TO STOP THIS
[3:52:06] <+talon84> Who played Maruader Shields?
[3:52:07] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt so you're gonna do another episode with Doc to talking about this shit right
[3:52:08] <+Aeogard> game is like good and fine right until the end breaks apart completely
[3:52:10] <$mattynezz> At least give Woolie an update on Kai "Pussy" Lang
[3:52:10] <dawarw0lf> THIS BETTER NOT BE THE CANNON ENDING
[3:52:10] <%peachy996> LOOK FORWARD TO ME4!
[3:52:11] <BrokenSeth> Let's be honest. Bioware was never going to be able to bring a satisfying conclusion to the story.
[3:52:11] <Sp3ctre48> I don't really have a lot to say about the ending that I didn't already say for most of ME3 honestly
[3:52:12] <CopingFawn> I hate how they desperately try to wriggle out is the intelligence being a synthetic because of the logical paradox it creates.
[3:52:12] <duke_of_dozel> GIEF
[3:52:13] <Archmortal> So did the plate of shit you had to eat taste better or worse than you were expecting when you saw it in the distance at the start of the game?
[3:52:13] <pmtriox> still the worst ending to anything, even after the "fixes" even after addressing criticism
[3:52:15] <Botman_R> LIKE TALI
[3:52:15] <ElSuperNova> RED>GREEN>BLUE
[3:52:15] <teefpal> RIP Robin Sahcs, sad this was his last project
[3:52:16] <%DSD24> Kai Leng was the worst
[3:52:16] <%shadowsofpain> Mass Effect 3 has the highest highs and the lowest of lows
[3:52:17] <PanicSwytch> WATCH THE OTHER ENDINGS
[3:52:18] <%peachy996> Please look forward to ME4
[3:52:20] <roughday25> aww he's so cute
[3:52:20] <haisho> throw itself off a cliff? I thought it spontaneously combusted!
[3:52:20] <Wydamn> @PatStaresAt was it better or worse than you expected?
[3:52:20] <Arqartur0> ahhh
[3:52:23] <chainsaw105> this is why you make up headcanon bullshit and do Citadel last
[3:52:23] <JetpackMcQuack> and throw out 30% of ME2
[3:52:24] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:52:26] <%hereiam407> Do you prefer the heat death ending?
[3:52:27] <brandonc90> PogChamp DOG
[3:52:29] <SaltyAzteca> He has a Krogan
[3:52:29] <Arqartur0> adorable doggo
[3:52:29] <someyounguy1> what a good boi
[3:52:30] <%Wallabri> that's a good dog
[3:52:30] <%KyJackshot> You should look up the ending they added after the game released
[3:52:31] <Mahbonk> Always remember Marauder Shields
[3:52:33] <%ScreamLord> You can see the exact moment when the plot just shits the bath
[3:52:33] <+castlearrrgh> When the game came out, one of the Bioware community managers said the Normandy crashed on Earth. You know, the planet with two moons.
[3:52:33] <RetributionP> Andromeda one off when?
[3:52:34] <dresdengh0st> what an adorable square headed puppy
[3:52:35] <%willjar313> Zangief tried to turn off your stream to save you from this ending, Pat.
[3:52:35] <+7gryphons> @PatStaresAt  three days locked in a room for this!
[3:52:35] <%SinnerEbru> i hope ea blows it own ass before ME4 is ever made
[3:52:36] <Brandon__Brando> how close is it to the game of thrones ending?
[3:52:36] <Valkryna> did it end badly enough to ruin the rest of the games to you?
[3:52:37] <chancho4tierra> Did you like the final boss Marauder Shields?
[3:52:37] <%shurtal> Gotta preserve that story newness, by......making a MUCH WORSE CONFLICT
[3:52:40] <%sporeian94> sporeian94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! HIS NAME WAS MARAUDER SHIELDS! HIS NAME WAS MARAUDER SHIELDS! HIS NAME WAS MARAUDER SHIELDS!!!!!!!!
[3:52:41] <%shootbang_exe> nah I think woolie would be interested in hearing how bad it is
[3:52:42] <teefpal> It really was dogshit, even after all this time it still stings
[3:52:42] <cthulu_fearlock> WATCH THE OTHER ENDINGS
[3:52:43] <Sp3ctre48> It's bad but it's not even the thing that makes ME3 pretty meh to me
[3:52:44] <+dementedcactus> That’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen HellBoy 2019
[3:52:45] <@Ranryu692> this is why doing the Citadel DLC after the ending doesn't make any sense
[3:52:45] <prime_name> Like, this shit contradicts every game in the series
[3:52:46] <scempriss> dont subject Kite Daddy to this, spoil it for him its a mercy
[3:52:47] <$realm_forge> DOG MAKES THE ENDINGS WORTH IT
[3:52:47] <dds333a> @dawarw0lf don't think this game has one
[3:52:47] <rytisone> and then Casey Hudson got a big fat paycheck
[3:52:47] <%peachy996> This is why Andromeda had to be set in a completely diff universe because how can you come back from this shit? And it still didn't work
[3:52:48] <%Monkeyweed21> LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE BETTER
[3:52:49] <dawarw0lf> GREEN>BLUE>RED
[3:52:52] <+BeardedLuchador> There's an additional ending if you shoot the Boy
[3:52:54] <zentzen> and it was even worse before
[3:52:56] <TourettesPlays> Buzz Aldrin is the best part of this shitty ending
[3:52:56] <%walternatorz> but did the heat death ending have a final boss the likes of marauder shields?
[3:52:56] <%SinnerEbru> HIS NAME WAS MAURADER SHIELDS HIS NAME WAS MAURADER SHIELDS HIS NAME WAS MAURADER SHIELDS HIS NAME WAS MAURADER SHIELDS
[3:52:56] <%Bt_Robot> REMEMBER YOUR TIRADE IN ANDROMEDA ABOUT OMNI-GEL?  wELL WHAT ABOUT MEDI-GEL?
[3:53:00] <%Treuan> Cheer500 What a ride.
[3:53:01] <Archmortal> This is why Citadel is canonically the real ending
[3:53:01] <%akscully> don't play after citadel dlc
[3:53:02] <+Aeogard> its like game of thrones season 8
[3:53:02] <%bear_breaker20> correct take
[3:53:02] <%hereiam407> Good idea
[3:53:02] <%Ipsenscastle> yeah
[3:53:02] <Wolfstriker121> RIP MARUDER SHIELDS he legit tryed to save us all
[3:53:03] <%akscully> yep
[3:53:03] <%LaughingCatt> YUP
[3:53:04] <%strakillias> Do the ending once then stop at Citadel. This is the way
[3:53:04] <pmtriox> except they also contradict ME1, because the CATALYST WAS THE CITADEL AND SELF AWARE THE ENTIRE TIME
[3:53:05] <Mattais88> That's what I do
[3:53:05] <+cermo55> fair
[3:53:06] <Jane_Lo> I KNOW RIGHT?
[3:53:06] <+JonathLP> That's fair
[3:53:07] <$lotharrio> Citadel and done is probably the answer.
[3:53:07] <LightningLynx89> Like everyone else does
[3:53:07] <%NopeBadguy> they all died partying
[3:53:07] <%JoshManVGH> What happens if the clock runs out on the crucible?
[3:53:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> Green>Blue>Red.
[3:53:08] <%AmuserName> YEP.
[3:53:08] <+Extrallent> you should watch the others Pat
[3:53:08] <+krispen_wa> WE WARNED YOU PAT
[3:53:09] <$mattynezz> There are mods for that
[3:53:09] <%DXLelouch24> or mod it so citadel is the end
[3:53:11] <haisho> yeah that's what everyone else did
[3:53:11] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yes.
[3:53:12] <Virokwet> thats not a bad idea
[3:53:12] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> That's EXACTLY what I do Pat
[3:53:12] <%redthebaron> Yeah
[3:53:12] <$realm_forge> YUP
[3:53:12] <IvanMistwalker> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[3:53:14] <%DrTomT18> Did you like it before your reached Earth? lmao
[3:53:14] <+MagmaRam> @cthulu_fearlock They're still basically the same. also rip marauder shields american hero
[3:53:14] <%LittleCinders> This game had 5 Endings
[3:53:15] <d3ltuhhh> literally just do everything up to citadel then STOP
[3:53:15] <teefpal> This is why ending mods are mandatory.
[3:53:16] <%alphonseisbest> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[3:53:16] <GizmoKSX> OG game has mods so the Citadel beomes the ending.
[3:53:17] <+GingerStrawhat> It's bad enough that a replay of the series has an Aterrisk next to it
[3:53:18] <%Nekros4442> I mean, the game was already the worst when there was no confirmed Krogan teammate
[3:53:19] <Jaysky> You have other flavours though
[3:53:20] <fluffy_sauce> now you know Marauder Shields tried to save us from that terrible ending
[3:53:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's the only fine ending.
[3:53:20] <+xerotwo> YEP THE ENDING WITH THE FRIENDS WE MADE
[3:53:22] <dd44dostivei> you still have the alternate party
[3:53:25] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I KNOW
[3:53:26] <%SinnerEbru> thats why citadel is the end of the series
[3:53:27] <%Monkeyweed21> well at least you can relive this feeling in 6 or 7 months when AoT ends
[3:53:28] <+FattimusSlime> They only had Destroy kill EDI and the Geth because otherwise it would be far and away the objectively best ending.
[3:53:29] <%sporeian94> CAM'
[3:53:32] <pmtriox> horrible game
[3:53:33] <+HaunchPaunch> @patstaresat When you play 3 games you love and get an ending so bad, it feels like such a betrayal.
[3:53:33] <GizmoKSX> Citadel was made later, too, so it's the real ending from the devs.
[3:53:34] <pmtriox> horrible
[3:53:34] <%Wallabri> Citadel's so good
[3:53:34] <tanarath> It really puts the final bit of Citadel into perspective
[3:53:34] <%sporeian94> CAN'T WAIT FOR MASS EFFECT 4
[3:53:35] <%SwdVengeance> Here’s hoping ME4 just obliterates the ending from canon
[3:53:35] <PunchSlugfest> citadel is the true end
[3:53:35] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt look at the other flavors of ending?
[3:53:35] <%Ipsenscastle> well this ending was cobbled together afterwards to be fair
[3:53:35] <+xerotwo> THANKS EA
[3:53:36] <+Aeogard> LEGENDARY EDITION BTW!!!!
[3:53:37] <%afronooch> Everything from Rannoch onward
[3:53:37] <ElSuperNova> Because it was..
[3:53:38] <+JustToWatch> invite Doc on the stream and do a mini podcast about this
[3:53:40] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Then the final shot is just the burned photo floating in Space
[3:53:42] <+thehotrefrigerator> Maurader Shields the true last hero
[3:53:42] <%hereiam407> Imagine being there day one, and just getting that
[3:53:43] <%demiiluna> Did you see the mod where it changes Citadel to be post-ending?
[3:53:43] <%KetsuoTaberu> What's the whole business with the cut Dark Energy plotline?
[3:53:44] <%ConLin_Arts_> Hidden Gief
[3:53:44] <professorbadvibes> dogy
[3:53:44] <+rafaelba93> the original was even worse
[3:53:47] <dawarw0lf> I say try the other ending s after the stream
[3:53:47] <@Lion_kun> It took 6 months for you to get here.
[3:53:51] <Archmortal> See what you do is you beat the game, then you reload a save from before Citadel, and do Citadel
[3:53:52] <dawarw0lf> PLEASE
[3:53:52] <%hereiam407> Wait, did we get the after credits yet?
[3:53:55] <DapperCadavr> but the synthesis ending is SO dumb
[3:53:56] <%NopeBadguy> is that where woolie worked?
[3:53:57] <%DrTomT18> The real friends were the Qussy we crushed along the way
[3:53:58] <%peachy996> you can shoot the kid
[3:53:58] <Darren716> LUL
[3:53:59] <mysteriousmistermystery> @PatStaresAt And they let the guy who wrote this make Andromeda
[3:54:01] <Conscript_Gary> Rejection ending is actually different and worth watching
[3:54:01] <@ssjklyco> I can't believe they tried to do a sequel hook at the last part there with the N7 arm moving
[3:54:01] <%TheWinged7> thats woolies old company?
[3:54:01] <%Monkeyweed21> DID WOOLIE WORK ON THIS
[3:54:03] <%peachy996> And the cycle repeats
[3:54:04] <@Lion_kun> It took you 6 months to get this ending.
[3:54:04] <+Ardailec> Eh, I like Green Ending
[3:54:04] <$mattynezz> Look up the OG ending. It is not very long
[3:54:04] <rytisone> Shepard survives only in Destroy ending
[3:54:05] <Dunmarkh> woolie did this
[3:54:07] <TioXyco> poor guys...
[3:54:07] <Jaysky> YOU WILL KNOW CARE, SHEPHERD
[3:54:07] <%Dapper_Cactuar> if I remember right Pat Casey rewrote the ending over the course of a weekend since the original intended ending leaked and he threw a fit
[3:54:08] <+krispen_wa> LE BAGUETTE
[3:54:10] <%akscully> wouldn't brag about it
[3:54:11] <%ScreamLord> Make fun of them
[3:54:11] <JetpackMcQuack> Refuse is the best ending
[3:54:12] <+D00msDayDan> So it’s woolie’s fault
[3:54:13] <%MegadBlitz> you know what good job for those artists and animators
[3:54:15] <wibbwobbler> Extra scenes actually made it worse imo
[3:54:16] <James_Quivers> THIS IS ALL WOOLIES FAULT
[3:54:17] <Darren716> Wow I cant believe Woolie ruined Mass Effect
[3:54:18] <@Spydurman> @PatStaresAt what do you think ME4 will do?
[3:54:18] <%NopeBadguy> he poking out
[3:54:18] <Mahbonk> yes
[3:54:19] <%hereiam407> Tell me another story
[3:54:19] <SaltyAzteca> It was Woolie all along
[3:54:19] <+Aeogard> was playing all these worth it pat? @PatStaresAt
[3:54:19] <+rafaelba93> they didnt want you to know
[3:54:19] <%SinnerEbru> no we cannot
[3:54:19] <+BeardedLuchador> @mysteriousmistermystery Let? they practically begged him Kappa
[3:54:20] <%sporeian94> MASS EFFECT IS DEAD
[3:54:20] <+Kyma1020> it was probably after woolie left
[3:54:21] <roughday25> yes he is very stupid and cute
[3:54:21] <%MelBrooksKA> They probably didn't want you to know @PatStaresAt
[3:54:21] <%willjar313> I now blame this game on Woolie.
[3:54:21] <%Wallabri> just his lil head peekin out
[3:54:21] <%emMmDeeKay> Check out the bonus SHOOT THE KID ending
[3:54:21] <TioXyco> we se you pat, yeah LUL
[3:54:22] <teefpal> The OG ending was even worse
[3:54:22] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  Pat there's some additional behind the scenes stuff around the Refusal Ending that you need to know regarding the Producers, can i hit you with a tweet?
[3:54:22] <%barrakuta371> I sees him
[3:54:24] <OvaltineDream> I seen him
[3:54:24] <%valriot> Its worse when alot of the game is GREAT, and some of the "bad stuff" could just be fixed with another go at it
[3:54:25] <%strakillias> I see the baby
[3:54:25] <%JoshManVGH> That dog is a delight
[3:54:25] <supergoblinpunch> Well you'd keep it quiet
[3:54:26] <GuyNamedGatsby> I was shocked when I heard they didn’t try and fix the ending for the collection
[3:54:26] <pmtriox> and this is why you were so colossally wrong when you said Cyberpunk was worse. IT IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME GALAXY as this awfulness
[3:54:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Look up the OG ending, it's short.
[3:54:27] <%TheWinged7> yes hes holding a mouse and keyboard Kappa
[3:54:27] <tanarath> no
[3:54:29] <Mahbonk> special eyes
[3:54:31] <RetributionP> "And the the crucible turned off all of the reapers and everyone lived happily ever after.
[3:54:31] <%SinnerEbru> awww a baby head
[3:54:33] <intestinal_bleeding> man how long has this mass effect journey been? about two months?
[3:54:34] <%hairtoday> hairtoday subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat, had to finally subscribe for this. The Harbinger scene is the dumbest thing ever- besides the obvious, when did the rest of the team get back to the Normandy? Clearly the writers wanted to strand them all, but the ship just leaves now anyway.
[3:54:37] <%Wallabri> like a couch shark
[3:54:38] <+Tredecian> shoot child endings is short
[3:54:40] <pochecito> yeah. he's the one streaming LUL
[3:54:41] <+thetunnelhomer> The original endings are even worse too
[3:54:42] <teefpal> Reload and shoot the star kid
[3:54:44] <JetpackMcQuack> I thought refuse was a fan ending for a long toime
[3:54:44] <%HaroldDonchee> pick the ending where you jump into the woolie hole
[3:54:49] <%sporeian94> The only thing that can save this is a HBO television adaptation that says "fuck the ending we're making our own!"
[3:54:49] <alrobot2014> shooting the child is the only ending that is completely different
[3:54:50] <Hellarussian> so
[3:54:56] <Angry_Ev1L> ME4 will also be dogshit bioware just not the same anymore and wasn't the same for a long time
[3:54:59] <tanarath> Couch Shark Zangief
[3:55:00] <%MightyDuckShoes> Shepard helped create new forms of like and then snuffed them out. NotLikeThis
[3:55:00] <%JoshManVGH> So was it worth the journey?
[3:55:06] <Sp3ctre48> Mass Effect 4 will continue after the destroy ending and be the safest thing ever so the series can get back on track. I'm hoping anyway
[3:55:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> worf
[3:55:07] <%ConLin_Arts_> Borf
[3:55:07] <%SinnerEbru> yeah good boy!!!
[3:55:08] <dawarw0lf> I think you would have flet better if you did the others but I'm screaming at a brick wall I understand
[3:55:08] <Zebroneath> bizzarre for best thing followed by worst thing
[3:55:08] <crassletter> NOW HOW ARE THEY GOING TO ADRESS THIS SHIT SHOW IN ME4
[3:55:10] <Alzero83> How you feeling about indoctrination theory now @PatStaresAt
[3:55:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @pmtriox I dunno man that montage skipping the first chapter of the game is pretty wack
[3:55:23] <%hairtoday> ignore it
[3:55:24] <$mattynezz> Poorly
[3:55:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I really dont see how there gonna do a mass effect 4
[3:55:26] <prime_name> I am so looking forward to Mass Effect 4
[3:55:27] <%peachy996> Fuck knows
[3:55:27] <@Lion_kun> Technically Mass Effect 5
[3:55:27] <%Mekhet09> I'd retcon everything.
[3:55:27] <+Ardailec> Probably pick an ending and stick with it
[3:55:27] <+toastybites> just retcon it
[3:55:28] <%hereiam407> The YAHG are the new reapers
[3:55:28] <+Tredecian> indoc theory cannon for 4 lol
[3:55:29] <%Profmcstevie> This is all VERY funny if you screw with the genophage cure LUL
[3:55:31] <willyfreshness> I would make andromeda but not shitty

[3:56:02] <+cermo55> Grunt
[3:56:02] <pmtriox> Wrex
[3:56:02] <@Ranryu692> Liara is 106
[3:56:03] <%Varlinator> A Matriarch if you will
[3:56:04] <oda_flobunaga> 1000 yrs ish
[3:56:04] <chainsaw105> Grunt too

[3:56:05] <scempriss> and this is all senile ramblings
[3:56:05] <+thetunnelhomer> Grunt would still be alive too
[3:56:05] <+chippracoon> she is 120 in this game
[3:56:05] <%the_Punktuation> Grunt?
[3:56:05] <%hereiam407> Oh wait, the left over Leviathons!
[3:56:05] <%valriot> Liara is old in the teaser, she has crows feet and everything
[3:56:06] <%DrTomT18> Grunt would have
[3:56:06] <dawarw0lf> my preferred idea too
[3:56:06] <Macguffn> Best ME4 adopts indoctrination theory with destroy ending and synthetic life dying was an attempt to dissuade shepard from chosing it
[3:56:07] <+JohnTimbre> Grunt could live that ling.
[3:56:07] <mr_saturday93> Grunt?
[3:56:07] <%shadowsofpain> Grunt
[3:56:07] <%Wallabri> Grunt too maybe

[3:56:11] <+LegacyOfTheSith> grunt tho
[3:56:12] <%machshop> LUL

[3:56:20] <jacobknight13> awwwwww
[3:56:20] <+chippracoon> ya she is 106 years old in this game right?
[3:56:21] <%Varlinator> Nooooooo Not Grunt!
[3:56:23] <Wolfstriker121> idk  im trying here lol
[3:56:24] <teridax4> Grunt
[3:56:25] <%Laecerelius> WREX AND NO LIARA
[3:56:26] <%shootbang_exe> no keep grunt and wrex they're good
[3:56:26] <oda_flobunaga> GRUNT or Wrex

[3:56:29] <jacobknight13> my baby krogan!
[3:56:30] <Goraka91> REAPERS 2
[3:56:30] <+D00msDayDan> Krogan lifespan is 400 years
[3:56:30] <%chance_h> Grunt would die via violence
[3:56:30] <Jaysky> Shut yer mouth they wouldn't die
[3:56:31] <%ErikFeral> She's old, and doesn't have any good memories anymore
[3:56:31] <%RealThiele> SON OF GRUNT
[3:56:31] <%Laecerelius> WREX OR RIOT
[3:56:31] <%afronooch> One system only
[3:56:32] <+SilverDevilfish> Let us play as other races too.
[3:56:33] <janpsff> The best ending is the one where you shoot the holo kid.
[3:56:33] <alrobot2014> wrex is already in his 700s at least
[3:56:33] <+JJJKopf> THE UNIVERSE ENDING
[3:56:33] <Dunmarkh> Krogan don't live that long on purpose
[3:56:33] <%hereiam407> @PatStaresAt What about the leftover Leviathons?
[3:56:34] <Finchit> That wont happen. Its going to be even biggerer
[3:56:34] <@commanderclaw> Bioware doesn't know how to do Small Scale
[3:56:35] <intestinal_bleeding> solve a disease affecting a solar system
[3:56:35] <TheAntiNihilist> Grunt got DEATH BY SNU SNU
[3:56:35] <NewWillinium> So you can now see why with Andromeda they decided to fucking **flee** to another whole Universe right?
[3:56:37] <%shadowsofpain> Also how know how long Javik will be around
[3:56:37] <James_Quivers> Grunt and Wrex got shot in the new Krogan Rebellion because THAT'S GONNA BE A THING
[3:56:37] <TioXyco> the Yoogurt?
[3:56:38] <KeystoneA2> The Leviathans are trying to enslave everyone. Again.
[3:56:38] <Angry_Ev1L> yeah NO WAY lol
[3:56:38] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Liara was born in 2077. Current year is 2186
[3:56:39] <%sporeian94> YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO TOP THE REAPERS SOMEHOW PAT... DON'T EVEN DENY IT
[3:56:39] <%DrTomT18> No, Levithan would be the next threat
[3:56:40] <topiodonk> what about the teaser about sheppard alive?
[3:56:40] <teefpal> Smaller, more intimate, more focused
[3:56:41] <JetpackMcQuack> just us4e the sick ass universe
[3:56:41] <willyfreshness> Too many krogun
[3:56:43] <Darren716> No fuck you, gotta save the universe this time
[3:56:43] <AngryAsian5> Imagine if they revive the Dark Matter shit in ME4 LUL
[3:56:43] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> yogscast?
[3:56:44] <legion0047> Thats canon to the comics
[3:56:44] <d3ltuhhh> yeah it'll probably be leviathans or yahg as main villains
[3:56:44] <%peachy996> Bioware doesn't know how to small
[3:56:45] <%emMmDeeKay> Liara's daughter as the protagonist
[3:56:45] <+cermo55> Yog would be a credible sequel threat
[3:56:45] <@ssjklyco> He makes recordings in Adromeda, which the recordings were made 5 years after ME 3 i think
[3:56:46] <%LittleCinders> Legion would still be alive depending on the ending
[3:56:46] <%Profmcstevie> New species are reaching space travel, they're DICKS
[3:56:46] <+Tredecian> yahrg stole a battleship uh oh
[3:56:46] <+WutangchickeN> can we still get a token gay character in 4? LUL
[3:56:47] <VioletRosefall> isn't that the plot of Andromeda?
[3:56:47] <%senorpapel> Krogan can live to 1500, but that’s assuming they don’t kill each other.
[3:56:48] <%Varlinator> Pat, YOU JUST WANT A NEW BARARIAN RACE TO KILL!
[3:56:48] <$mattynezz> The Korgan are now super religious, and fucking up the Rachni
[3:56:49] <AluxStreams> "There's 1 reaper left."
[3:56:49] <GizmoKSX> More Yahg
[3:56:49] <oda_flobunaga> Have the option to not play as a human
[3:56:49] <Angry_Ev1L> it will be REAPERS 2.0
[3:56:50] <AngryAsian5> *Dark Energy
[3:56:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> NEW REAPERS
[3:56:50] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Pizza delivery goes whacky
[3:56:51] <%stickislaw> ME4 the reapers come back again and are extra mad
[3:56:51] <%EthorXL> just stick them on a planet with some metroids and have that be the whole game.
[3:56:51] <+Kyma1020> just be bounty hunters
[3:56:51] <Zebroneath> Batarians started a small war!
[3:56:52] <scempriss> How about we call it Mass effect and pretend the last trilogy never happened?
[3:56:52] <dds333a> Yahg supremacy
[3:56:52] <Finchit> Its gonna be fucking UNICRON
[3:56:52] <%bear_breaker20> rannoch are still around and have nothing to stop them now
[3:56:53] <%jackelzxaa> Yay pat won
[3:56:53] <%ahomeschooldropout> Andromeda could've been good if it was just exploring a new galaxy
[3:56:53] <teefpal> The Krogan are colonizing too much
[3:56:53] <pmtriox> no nothing
[3:56:53] <%chance_h> Feeding the hungry with Wrex
[3:56:54] <Psyramics> make one-off, not trilogy
[3:56:54] <%furiousfurioso> make the enemy a company or something
[3:56:54] <AlphaRayAllen> No, it's going to be some crazy asshole who wants to revive the reapers
[3:56:55] <Macguffn> Follow Moradin the Krogan and his adevntures
[3:56:55] <Khester824> how about Space Facism
[3:56:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Rakni wars again?
[3:56:56] <%Monkeyweed21> NO EVEN BIGGERER STAKES
[3:56:56] <Meltoras12> WE NEED TO  DESTROY STARKILLER BASE
[3:56:57] <OvaltineDream> The krogan's sewage system is broken
[3:56:57] <%hereiam407> Leviathons
[3:56:58] <Goraka91> We like Bioware games for the characters, we don't give a piss about saving the universe yet again
[3:56:58] <+Jiggisnipe> naw it'll be a universe problem now
[3:56:58] <%strakillias> Just make it about crime. Just be a dude working for Aria then shit pops off
[3:56:59] <%Ipsenscastle> you still end up with the problem of if synthetics exist or not
[3:56:59] <Brandon__Brando> you know bioware only dos end of the world storys
[3:56:59] <huskarl_zap> Gilf blussy Kreygasm
[3:57:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> someone will try to rebuild reapers or some shit
[3:57:00] <+rafaelba93> nothing short of the fate of all dimensions is enough
[3:57:00] <olaksi> getting scifi/fantasy writers to scale back though, that's a tough one
[3:57:00] <Archmortal> If it's an immediate sequel, shit happening while we repair the Citadel and relays is fine too
[3:57:01] <%jackelzxaa> I missed it what did he pick
[3:57:01] <ChungusQuest> THE BATARIANS ARE BACK
[3:57:01] <Angry_Ev1L> or better yet REAPER SHEPARD will be the final boss
[3:57:01] <%sporeian94> THE REAPERS WERE ACTUALLY THE GOOD GUYS PREVENTING... THE MEGA REAPERS
[3:57:01] <%machshop> "also we found more frozen protheans and woke them up lol"
[3:57:01] <James_Quivers> Just make it about some street rats on the Citadel
[3:57:02] <+columnFive> The problem with that is that there's no time skip you could do that can get around the implications of each ending
[3:57:02] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt but think about this Pat, Reaper 2
[3:57:03] <chainsaw105> Bioware's small-scale conflicts are the best, which is why Dragon Age 2 is my favorite story in those games
[3:57:03] <+JonathLP> RIP ZAEED
[3:57:04] <+mr_miyagucci> Wrex would be more likely a Krogan prime minister or councilor based on his role in ME3
[3:57:05] <Jmann1892> Make it like Citadel but an entire game
[3:57:05] <M0untain_wolf> Soon
[3:57:06] <+Extrallent> the new Geth should rebel
[3:57:06] <%sunsetdisc0> pat needs to see the post credits
[3:57:06] <Darren716> "The reapers were only 1 of 4 horsemen!"
[3:57:07] <%Garthunox> NO PAT! THE REAPERS ARE BACK! THEY ALL SURVIVED AND THEY WANNA KILL EVERYTHING AGAIN!
[3:57:07] <+monfo_the_great> I thought you all were joking about a 4... Dang

[4:02:45] <%brnand> Paige shouldn't play Andromeda either. Nobody should play Andromeda, it is a very bad video game.
[4:02:45] <quipquest1> It's called Taps, dumbass
[4:02:45] <Archmortal> Remember when you thought you could complete Citadel and the ending sequence in one stream
[4:02:46] <%hereiam407> Bawaahaaah
[4:02:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's the song Pat.
[4:02:47] <asthanius> Taps is the Trumpet
[4:02:47] <+JJJKopf> she's right
[4:02:48] <%SinnerEbru> the song paige was singing WAS taps
[4:02:48] <Macguffn> That's the name of the song
[4:02:48] <%strakillias> Pat you should get Andromeda and uninstall it at the beginning of the next stream to fuck with Wednesday chat.
[4:02:49] <ctk96> I've actually just started Andromeda and am curious to see how it'll go, I just finished the first act and half and I've been semi enjoying it
[4:02:49] <jorniev> HER SONG WAS BETTER
[4:02:49] <+FattimusSlime> Thoughts And Prayers
[4:02:49] <%shadowsofpain> shadowsofpain subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Well that was disappointing, aren't you glad that Mass Effect 3 has the absolute best mass effect moments and the absolute worsts as well. I can't think of another game with these peaks and valleys
[4:02:50] <%hereiam407> BWAHHHHHH
[4:02:51] <%stickislaw> That's what the song is called
[4:02:51] <+pectusumbra> the sad song is named Taps

[4:05:46] <+JJJKopf> it's like... 10% war criminals?
[4:05:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yasakuni is All war dead, including war criminals
[4:05:49] <%MegadBlitz> the rat tits dance
[4:05:50] <%Varlinator> Is Paige drunk?

[4:05:58] <%Aleate> God Kai Leng is so cool
[4:05:58] <SaltyAzteca> Rats for tits sounds weird
[4:06:00] <rudiciuscaesar> China and Korea still demand Japan to remove it, or at least take out the dudes like Tojo.
[4:06:01] <%SaiyanShoto> So paiges tits will cause her to drown
[4:06:05] <%Third_Mattress> its so precious
[4:06:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what's worse is the horrible nationalist museum attached to the shrine
[4:06:15] <%JoshManVGH> It's Raddits? no, it's Rat Tits
[4:06:16] <%CalderGaming> publicly going to Yasukuni is a dogwhistle to japanese nationalists that the visitor thinks japan did nothing wrong, or close enough
[4:06:19] <rytisone> Kai Leng lost cause he was wearing heavy clothes
[4:06:19] <Arqartur0> I gotta say, even if this game is kind of... eh, it is good that you have conquered a goblin, Pat :)
[4:06:20] <+Kyma1020> Spaaaaace Racism
[4:06:21] <%jackelzxaa> The shrine has a bunch of canceled metroid games hidden under it
[4:06:23] <+D00msDayDan> Oh I heard about that shrine some vtuber or voice actor was canceled by China for killing time there
[4:06:42] <chancho4tierra> MARAUDER SHIELDS!!!

[4:07:12] <%MooseIsGoose> They will
[4:07:13] <rytisone> resurect him again

[4:07:16] <%hairtoday> you'd THINK
[4:07:19] <olaksi> but that sounds stupid
[4:07:19] <Mattais88> Yeah, but consider: EA
[4:07:24] <$mattynezz> They already showed Liara looking for Shepard
[4:07:26] <%afronooch> Andromeda is fine to play. but the story is pointless
[4:07:29] <Sp3ctre48> They're 100% going to bring Shepard back I have no faith in them

[4:08:17] <%afronooch> yep
[4:08:17] <+cermo55> yup
[4:08:19] <+CyanDeadEye> That bit with the Normandy spits in the face of the *ENTIRE* purpose of the final run
[4:08:19] <%dekkitout> Yeah, Joker is cool
[4:08:20] <jorniev> THAT
[4:08:20] <Virokwet> mmhhm
[4:08:21] <+Aeogard> yes (:
[4:08:21] <%barrakuta371> That was cool
[4:08:22] <@Ranryu692> yeah because the Mako is the best
[4:08:22] <%Piemono> Mako had good brakes
[4:08:23] <jorniev> YES
[4:08:24] <%Wallabri> hmmmmmm
[4:08:26] <+sinistersally> I like your funny works, magic man
[4:08:26] <%Treuan> oh holy shit yeah it would
[4:08:30] <MrATheGreat> yeah it was the coolest thing he did in that game
[4:08:33] <%ZephynM> Could you imagine if they pulled a Halo 4 and had some magic A.I. chick save Shepherd at the last second? After all that explosions in their face.
[4:08:34] <+MagmaRam> The Mako was good
[4:08:34] <+kahryez> yes in the old normandy that was smaller yes
[4:08:36] <Virtualman117> they didnt have the mako anymore
[4:08:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> csbeastMember
[4:08:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Joker got that landing strip pregmant
[4:08:38] <Mattais88> But you don't have a mako in 3?
[4:08:39] <+JustToWatch> DESTROY HIM ZANGIEF
[4:08:39] <%JamesCorck> What's a Mass Effect 1?
[4:08:39] <%RealThiele> mako crucible level
[4:08:40] <%HaroldDonchee> or everyone gets shot down and dies
[4:08:41] <karl_rex> Normand 1 was a smaller ship. Plus no Mako in 3
[4:08:43] <%Ipsenscastle> That would've been sick if you saved the day with the Mako at the end of 3 haha
[4:08:43] <rytisone> nah man, reaper was guarding it
[4:08:45] <%barrakuta371> Yes, Casey Hudson plot though
[4:08:45] <%CalderGaming> it uh was a smaller normandy lol never mind
[4:08:47] <Sp3ctre48> We wouldn't have had that bland mission then
[4:08:47] <%Wallabri> nighto35Hmm nighto35Hmm nighto35Hmm
[4:08:49] <jorniev> HALO DROP THE SQUAD
[4:08:50] <+Kyma1020> you know. drop the mako on the mako that was falling at the party?
[4:08:51] <%cooldude69xx> @InquisidorARG When one thing is SUPER bad, good faith to brush things off goes away
[4:08:51] <%MidnightBurst12> just drop off everyone else
[4:08:56] <%jackelzxaa> What if harbinger shot the mako
[4:08:57] <%SinnerEbru> gief is murdering that squeaky toy
[4:09:02] <MrATheGreat> Btw it's a shame you deleted the game you missed the fourth ending where the writers said fuck you for hating the endings you got
[4:09:03] <%sniffy77> sniffy77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! More stories need to not be "SAVE THE ENTIRE GALAXY FROM BLOWING UP". I remember I was hoping Halo 5 would be a smaller story but then they had the entire UNSC fall in like a day and made AIs forever ruined in that universe.
[4:09:05] <%SinnerEbru> im so proud of him
[4:09:09] <MaybeFalco> hades ex still hurts my head
[4:09:09] <Virokwet> yknow the normady crew is good at jumping across short gsaps
[4:09:12] <%HaroldDonchee> dude why don't they just land troops right in the middle of the battlefield
[4:09:18] <olaksi> literally the writers realizing oh shit there needs to be an emotional scene there but having written the scenario so it makes 0 sense
[4:09:19] <Virokwet> gaps
[4:09:29] <RetributionP> wasn't the SR2 to heavy to work well in lower atmosphere? that's why you had the kodyak.
[4:09:33] <InquisidorARG> @InquisidorARG if you think mass effect 3 is SUPER BAD you haven't played a lot of videogames good sir
[4:09:43] <%jackelzxaa> Would people have been as mad at the altered ending?
[4:10:18] <%afronooch> yep
[4:10:22] <%cooldude69xx> @InquisidorARG And if you think the last five hours of ME 3 arent super bad, your standards are low
[4:10:28] <%Profmcstevie> Second genocide thank you
[4:10:33] <mike2hands> i just came up to the ending
[4:10:33] <%DashXero> It was the best possible genocide you could have committed.
[4:10:34] <chancho4tierra> can they use jet pack propulsion to get to the beacon
[4:10:38] <+Aeogard> vanguard is so fun to play tho
[4:10:44] <%jackelzxaa> Did pat kill the geths
[4:10:45] <olaksi> i mean it is a pretty horrible message all in all - genocide is just inevitable and peace is impossible
[4:10:49] <Ids560> you commit genocide basically any ending you choose
[4:10:56] <Goraka91> SO BAD
[4:11:00] <@ssjklyco> It seems stupid that the AI that controls all the reapers doesn't have a  literal "Reaper off" button.
[4:11:01] <SaltyAzteca> BUT THEYRE ALL BAD
[4:11:01] <%dekkitout> Should make it a 2 axis graph
[4:11:04] <%hewlettfan96> how we doing grody man
[4:11:06] <Brandon__Brando> wait GOT is worst?
[4:11:08] <Virokwet> bio charge is stellar
[4:11:08] <%RealThiele> retroactive ending destruction
[4:11:12] <iswearimjustdandy> Tell me the ending now
[4:11:12] <%bear_breaker20> mass effect ending somehow more satisfying than GoT
[4:11:12] <%bravebravesrobin> Whussy, gentille Whussy, whussy, je te plumerai. Cheer500
[4:11:13] <+Aeogard> so just like mass effect? LUL
[4:11:14] <Mattais88> 3 seasons
[4:11:17] <%polothegreatest> just like GOT LUL
[4:11:17] <%hewlettfan96> Kind believe i missed the whole finale
[4:11:18] <Weltallgaia> Writer strike will do that
[4:11:18] <%Mekhet09> Battlestar galactica highly forshadowed it too.
[4:11:19] <dawarw0lf> my brother says otherwise
[4:11:19] <%AncelDeLambert> ... so just ignore the last five episodes?
[4:11:20] <wibbwobbler> Ah maaan
[4:11:21] <%SinnerEbru> thank u paige for asking my questions for me lmfao
[4:11:22] <jett_eyes> SPACE is LAME
[4:11:23] <%CalderGaming> BSG: there was no plan
[4:11:24] <+toastybites> did you not like space Jesus
[4:11:26] <+JonathLP> game of thrones at least slowed down
[4:11:29] <TheIronBrass> So Game of Thrones?
[4:11:32] <legion0047> you mean season 4.5?
[4:11:39] <Virokwet> yup
[4:11:39] <%jackelzxaa> Game of Thrones ending is worse because it feels like they didnt care and just wanted to make a star wars trilogy @patstaresat
[4:11:40] <%HaroldDonchee> JOKER IS A CYLON
[4:11:43] <%hewlettfan96> Just like GoT
[4:11:51] <%bravebravesrobin> Loved the BSG reimagining; hated the ending
[4:11:55] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man I cant wait for the AoT final season
[4:11:56] <Weltallgaia> The reveal of all the secret robots is at like the halfway point of the series
[4:11:58] <%DrTomT18> ITS JOKING TIME
[4:11:58] <dawarw0lf> I'm only a season in but my brother says its fine
[4:12:00] <%RealThiele> reject technology
[4:12:01] <+tempestzephyr> secret korean robots?
[4:12:02] <InquisidorARG> @InquisidorARG Naa, i have played much worse in the atari, sega, super Nintendo and playstation 1
[4:12:09] <haisho> no possible logic would point to that solution
[4:12:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> pls dont
[4:12:13] <%bear_breaker20> eat bugs to live
[4:12:20] <Virokwet> we will farm
[4:12:22] <%Profmcstevie> "I shall chew this sand to live"
[4:12:22] <rytisone> lick the slime off the rocks, like Lisa
[4:12:23] <%Treuan> pain
[4:12:27] <%hewlettfan96> reject all technology
[4:12:29] <linSP> just eat rock fam
[4:12:30] <Sapphire_Breeze> JON SNOW IS A CYLON
[4:12:36] <Archmortal> yes
[4:12:38] <+goblinking92> yes
[4:12:39] <%jackelzxaa> Game of Thrones is a worse ending than both
[4:12:39] <%vivaldiva> pretty much
[4:12:40] <+JonathLP> Close enough
[4:12:40] <%Ipsenscastle> yeah you're about right
[4:12:41] <%BigCoffee> you forgot god magic
[4:12:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> Imo, nop
[4:12:42] <%retrohazard> I give BSG a bit of a pass because SciFi fucked them and they didn't get renewed when the final season was already halfway finished
[4:12:42] <Mattais88> Close enough
[4:12:43] <%TDotGoat> yes
[4:12:44] <%Ynkubus_> Most of it yeah
[4:12:44] <%bravebravesrobin> meh
[4:12:45] <tattleworm> it just hit the religious angle way too hard
[4:12:45] <@commanderclaw> You're being too kind to it if anything
[4:12:46] <@ssjklyco> I thought it wss the were all cylons
[4:12:46] <Weltallgaia> No for part 1, yes for part 2
[4:12:47] <Virokwet> ok
[4:12:49] <tattleworm> that's not why anyone was there
[4:12:50] <%hewlettfan96> Is it worse though than starship troopers
[4:12:51] <@Ranryu692> I lost interest at the end of the fourth season and stopped watching LUL
[4:12:52] <%RealThiele> rejection of all tech is the issue they are future people
[4:12:52] <Weltallgaia> The ending is complete nonsense
[4:12:52] <%notsoy> i'm trying to imagine the sheer comedy of yakuza 2 if they hadn't decided who the secret koreans were
[4:12:52] <%ScreamLord> What if the Turians and Quarians ate each other? Technically not cannibalism
[4:12:55] <%hewlettfan96> or babylon 5
[4:12:56] <%Monkeyweed21> yea its awful and nonsense that falls apart under scrutiny
[4:12:57] <%bravebravesrobin> ending was the weakest
[4:12:58] <%SinnerEbru> HIS NAME WAS MAURADER SHIELDS
[4:13:00] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt more like in trillion to one odds these rocks are actually edible
[4:13:01] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah doggo
[4:13:01] <%jackelzxaa> Game of Thrones ending feels like they didnt even care
[4:13:03] <%dekkitout> Never forget M. Shields
[4:13:03] <%CalderGaming> Babylon 5: there was EXTREMELY and plan and it was GREAT... then they got another season they weren't counting on so they had like a season and a half of awkward afterstory
[4:13:09] <OvaltineDream> His head is so big now
[4:13:09] <%polothegreatest> the fan ending of  GOT is better
[4:13:09] <Weltallgaia> Babylon 5 was so damn good
[4:13:12] <%bravebravesrobin> reveal of final five was AWESOME though
[4:13:12] <rytisone> try playing day 1 version
[4:13:15] <%jackelzxaa> GoT is so bad everyone ignores that they ever watched it
[4:13:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> His name...was Marauder Shields.

[4:14:01] <@ssjklyco> What was the point to the "dream" things shepard had? It added nothing
[4:14:06] <dawarw0lf> me3 is a good game, not great
[4:14:06] <+Kyma1020> like out of everything. why a kid?
[4:14:07] <+JustToWatch> honestly GOT was much worse than Galatica
[4:14:07] <%DrTomT18> BIG BOI
[4:14:08] <%hewlettfan96> why you so gaseous
[4:14:10] <%Mekhet09> That's all the endings though.
[4:14:16] <%jackelzxaa> If you take too long to pick an ending it just says GAME OVER
[4:14:22] <%CalderGaming> because shepard is still hung up on that kid who died in the opening. shut up that it only gets mentioned like three times. shut up though.

[4:15:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Dark Souls 1 is also a game of peaks and valleys
[4:15:02] <%SinnerEbru> oh no pat :c
[4:15:03] <%hewlettfan96> Mass effect is a complete zigzag In quality
[4:15:04] <%Aleate> Good
[4:15:12] <teefpal> fair
[4:15:13] <%MidnightBurst12> it's for the best
[4:15:14] <%dekkitout> Prohibited. Embargoed. Precluded,
[4:15:16] <%DrTomT18> no fun allowed
[4:15:19] <tanarath> Imagine if ME3 & ME: A had both been given 2-3 more years each and actual writers.
[4:15:19] <%DashXero> Build guides are contraband.
[4:15:23] <Blank9> skyward sword is pretty peaks and valleys but not like me3
[4:15:25] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I only look at optimized builds after I beat the game once or twice
[4:15:30] <Zombrocom> On a normal to lower difficulty you can just pick any class and just roll it to 20 with no issues
[4:15:30] <SaltyAzteca> ooof
[4:15:30] <%HaroldDonchee> be your real self pat. break the shackles of wife
[4:15:31] <Sapphire_Breeze> NO SAVE THE WORLD
[4:15:33] <@ssjklyco> See jojo
[4:15:35] <+Basker17> Small scale is Yakuza
[4:15:37] <%Faustgesicht> Small scale is why ME2 is so good
[4:15:39] <rytisone> small is good
[4:15:39] <tattleworm> but then you can't have a blue laser shoot into the sky
[4:15:40] <%DrTomT18> halo was never small scale
[4:15:41] <%cactus_gato> i think Doom 3 is on par with peaks and valleys
[4:15:41] <%Daxalog> Thats why Halo Wars is fun
[4:15:43] <olaksi> but how audience care
[4:15:43] <ShiningAxis> sometimes you just need to chase a serial killer around
[4:15:48] <%sniffy77> AIs got true freedom for a day and they immediately went galactic tyrant on everyone
[4:15:49] <Ravioli_Ronin> Andromeda has a small scale problem Kappa
[4:15:50] <+RoByte2> There's a reason they retire AI's after about 7 years in the Halo universe
[4:15:51] <%dekkitout> Small scale is why westens as a genre will not die
[4:15:51] <iswearimjustdandy> More stories need to be make sure the universe blows up like you know what
[4:15:52] <%spitelite> no we need 5000 death stars to emphasize the threat
[4:15:55] <%SinnerEbru> bless u paige
[4:15:56] <%afronooch> bless you paige
[4:15:57] <%Treuan> bless you
[4:15:57] <Archmortal> if they just wrote the ME3 ending to be "the armada is big enough, you won" it'd have been better than anything we got
[4:16:01] <Mahbonk> bless u
[4:16:06] <BiostormEX> mass efect 5
[4:16:07] <%akscully> dragon age 2
[4:16:10] <%hewlettfan96> bless u Paige
[4:16:14] <%HaroldDonchee> you're so good looking
[4:16:16] <Zebroneath> Baldur's Gate 1 starts off small scale
[4:16:16] <+JonathLP> Yakuza is the closest thing to that
[4:16:18] <%chance_h> Pathfinder tends to punish multiclassing especially with certain spell casters
[4:16:18] <tanarath> You're excused, Paige.
[4:16:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @Blank9 Skyward Sword's peaks and vallies are summarised by Ghirahim and the Imprisoned, both bosses you fight three times
[4:16:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Disco is almost that too
[4:16:26] <%Fooguwu> So Disco Elysium too
[4:16:27] <%notsoy> yakuza has secretly always been an RPG except for the combat (until 7)
[4:16:30] <Zombrocom> Ehh, yakuza is usually like a 2 city RPG
[4:16:31] <Estwilde> Yep
[4:16:31] <Zalpar> Every game has to end with you fighting the Devil or God or something.
[4:16:32] <Archmortal> Yakuza, The Last Story, Dragon Age 2, Disco Elysium
[4:16:33] <willyfreshness> THE EMPTY LOT
[4:16:34] <%bravebravesrobin> what's your view on The Expanse? Cheer500
[4:16:34] <28moogles> This is Dragon Age 2 and people hated it and yelled that you couldn't save the world.
[4:16:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> Disco Elysium is that as well.
[4:16:37] <+cermo55> empty lot
[4:16:38] <comicalmond> I'm currently playing like a dragon
[4:16:39] <Astrophizz> well like 20 city blocks
[4:16:41] <Mahbonk> as small scalled as it can get
[4:16:42] <%Profmcstevie> crime life issues
[4:16:44] <%shadowsofpain> ME2 has the lowest total scale, which can make it seem like the most filler/inconsequential of its trilogy but it was the best game overall
[4:16:44] <%Monkeyweed21> BUILD A BIG TOWER/STRIP MALL
[4:16:48] <Qu1ckyyy> 13 sentinels?
[4:16:49] <%dekkitout> Crime noirs/dramas will always be in fashion
[4:16:50] <$mattynezz> Well. it
[4:16:53] <%DrTomT18> wide as a puddle, deep as the ocean
[4:16:54] <teefpal> But it does have broader implications!
[4:16:54] <%SinnerEbru> but publishers are like BIGGER MEANS BETTER THO
[4:16:56] <%Nekros4442> Keep the problem SOMEWHAT relateable
[4:16:56] <vicar_anat> SAVE JAPAN
[4:16:58] <rytisone> small is fine, ladies
[4:17:00] <$mattynezz> Well, it's secretly about stopping the Apocalypse
[4:17:02] <SinisterBroccoli> @28moogles It still needs to be good tho
[4:17:04] <olaksi> but then you have to write characters the audience cares about and that's haaaard
[4:17:06] <%CalderGaming> YEAH season 4
[4:17:06] <%JoshManVGH> So Yakuza 6?
[4:17:08] <addictionex> the world ending is a side thing in disco elysium
[4:17:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> Trails in the Sky trilogy was almost that (even though not one city)
[4:17:10] <InquisidorARG> But people dont want small scale in Mass Effect or Dragon Age
[4:17:11] <comicalmond> bizarre town
[4:17:11] <+cermo55> Yakuza 7 big stakes though
[4:17:12] <%DashXero> Season 4 best season.
[4:17:12] <iswearimjustdandy> THE EMPTY LOT
[4:17:13] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Okay but counter point Pat: MARK 2! LUL
[4:17:16] <%Monkeyweed21> YAKUZA 7 IS ABOUT STOPPING A DUDE FROM BULLYING PROSTITUTES
[4:17:20] <%DrTomT18> yakuza 7 gets pretty large scale
[4:17:22] <roboyuji> I love Part 4
[4:17:22] <%ahomeschooldropout> I mean tbf Yakuza 2 was like THE ENTIRETY OF JAPAN
[4:17:22] <Archmortal> *technically* the Persona games?
[4:17:24] <%Daxalog> Is Yakuza a sci fi cover shooter with aliens? ANd or Secret Koreans?
[4:17:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Morio-cho radioooooo~
[4:17:25] <devanmuse> a crazy noisy town
[4:17:25] <Arqartur0> What about a Sopranos Game, but made AS silly as the Yakuza series?
[4:17:26] <%jackelzxaa> John Yakuza has to stop the second impact from happening, pat
[4:17:28] <%hewlettfan96> bizarre noise town
[4:17:29] <scempriss> You mean part 4 *adjusts glasses*
[4:17:37] <%Faustgesicht> Which Yakuza had the battleship in it?
[4:17:37] <comicalmond> kira wants to live a quiet life
[4:17:39] <28moogles> @SinisterBroccoli Good thing it's the best Bioware game then.
[4:17:39] <%Mekhet09> PART 6.
[4:17:41] <%Mekhet09> SOON
[4:17:42] <$realm_forge> Too big a menu ruins the restaurant
[4:17:45] <%DXLelouch24> yea but thats what makes Yakuza great, its goofyness
[4:17:47] <@PeachSaliva> @scempriss haha you’re right! my bad
[4:17:49] <jett_eyes> Say what you want, but Yakuza 1 and 2 had the best story
[4:17:49] <%dekkitout> @Arqartur0 I'm told there is a sopranos game
[4:17:56] <%ZephynM> I just noticed Pat is wearing an Archer shirt.
[4:17:58] <Ids560> it's unfortunate the one time they tried to scale back a series they gave them 14 months to do it
[4:18:00] <%AmuserName> The Wire Season 4: "Will these kids be able to escape the gang life?"
[4:18:01] <rytisone> Casey came back to save Anthem
[4:18:01] <Brandon__Brando> bioware makes amazing worlds that you never get to explore because its ending
[4:18:06] <SinisterBroccoli> lol
[4:18:07] <Virokwet> bbb bonkers
[4:18:09] <olaksi> i am honestly mildly surprised EDI isn't just there in the extended
[4:18:10] <@Lion_kun> A sci fi show
[4:18:12] <%Mekhet09> TV SHOW
[4:18:12] <%octavian_wolf> the expanse RULES
[4:18:14] <%Daxalog> The show
[4:18:14] <Ravioli_Ronin> Oh yeah, I forgot like all the soldiers in London just get ducking vaporized
[4:18:14] <Goraka91> The low destroy ending straight up shows everyone disintegrating
[4:18:15] <Angry_Ev1L> watch it
[4:18:15] <+toastybites> The Expanse is great
[4:18:15] <28moogles> The Expanse is a good scifi show
[4:18:16] <@commanderclaw> It's a really cool Sci Fi show/Book Series
[4:18:16] <%ZephynM> ZephynM gifted a Tier 1 sub to 28moogles! They have given 5 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:18:17] <%JoshManVGH> Anazon Scifi show
[4:18:18] <+Tredecian> the expanse is hard scifi in sol system
[4:18:18] <Arqartur0> @Arqartur0 Oooh no.
[4:18:19] <%BigCoffee> sci fi show that's real good
[4:18:20] <PanicSwytch> Syfy show
[4:18:22] <$mattynezz> Cool sci-fi book series/show
[4:18:23] <%DrTomT18> pour one out for dragon age
[4:18:26] <%gaomachine> Sci-fi.  It good.  Watch Expanse Pat.  Watch!
[4:18:29] <@goose_attack_almanac> @PatStaresAt It's a Hard Sci-Fi series on Amazon based on a book series.
[4:18:30] <%bravebravesrobin> that show is amazing

[4:19:06] <%hewlettfan96> HOLY SHIIT
[4:19:07] <%JoshManVGH> Oh fuck that is absolutly true...
[4:19:08] <Goraka91> @NewWillinium Well, if it wasn't the one city and unfinished
[4:19:10] <%DrTomT18> dragon age 2 is really small scale
[4:19:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> @justcallmebobplease better stop your evil teacher from destroying the world
[4:19:10] <scempriss> Big stories are good way to make sure you skim over a cool world
[4:19:12] <iswearimjustdandy> My parents like the expanse, which indicates that i will not
[4:19:13] <+D00msDayDan> i just want a mass effect game about taking down a mob boss on the citadel
[4:19:14] <Virokwet> the expanse is great
[4:19:14] <%HaroldDonchee> that's what makes the worlds so good though
[4:19:14] <+Soliloquy123> "Quick, assemble all the cool races and factions!
