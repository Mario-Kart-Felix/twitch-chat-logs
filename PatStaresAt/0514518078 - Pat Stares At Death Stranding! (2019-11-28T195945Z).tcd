[0:23:04] <Mendin> Speaking of, what flavor Monster is Pat drinking today?
[0:23:08] <marvel877> probably none, considering his internet was dying the other day and yesterday he was playing other stuff.
[0:23:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO
[0:23:27] <%honeyman18> This cardio shit is gonna pair weird with my food coma

[0:25:07] <%Laecerelius> Make sure to bring your gasmask so you don't die to farts
[0:25:13] <rytisone> no need to wrap it if you can pull out
[0:25:13] <Valegator> how much till the end?
[0:25:18] <+DesertPenguin> 100 hours
[0:25:23] <+ekimthegib> I'm pretty sure the meaty story stuff starts soon, depends on how much stars pat goes for
[0:25:29] <ovan20> @Valegator 1000 hours
[0:25:29] <Sprawler14> nah, you wrap it and slap it thats my motto
[0:25:29] <blaggablag> At least 5 2 hour custcenes
[0:25:54] <+ekimthegib> This game ends about 5 times, it's great
[0:25:54] <Valegator> @ovan20 too much
[0:25:57] <valriot> Don't pull out, just let it fall out instead
[0:26:07] <lyzejag> @Valegator 5-7H maybe
[0:26:13] <ovan20> GUN rooH
[0:26:20] <nukle0nik> there's like, only two places in the entire game where you need the oxygen mask
[0:26:24] <+Deekman> @AngriestPat is there any reason to use a lethal weapon?
[0:26:34] <nukle0nik> no reason to use lethal weapons ever
[0:26:48] <%oAznoUta> the reason is "because I want to"
[0:26:54] <Sprawler14> lethal weapons are there to tempt you
[0:27:01] <+ekimthegib> I think lethal weapons do big damage to BT's with Blood grenades
[0:27:03] <lyzejag> Well you can steal the weapons for enemies then use them but if can prepare than no
[0:27:03] <MalignantUpper> lethal weapon + blood grenades are good against BFs
[0:27:03] <nukle0nik> 50 minutes is plenty time
[0:27:05] <+Deekman> i feel like their should be a mechanic like red dead redemption where you fire it in the air and anyone that sees it scatters
[0:27:07] <ALazo> What even happens if you kill someone in terms of gameplay
[0:27:17] <%afronooch> voidout potentially

[0:27:26] <nukle0nik> are you squdding me
[0:27:30] <ovan20> @AngriestPat can all the time sensitive deliveries be made on foot?
[0:27:31] <old_dog_god> Lethal weapons can be used to cleanse Mule camps but you have to burn their bodies to avoid voidouts
[0:27:33] <Mister_McDerp> is it alive?
[0:27:35] <+D00msDayDan> @ALazo if you leave the corpse for 48 realtime hours you get a game over and have to load your last save

[0:36:25] <Sprawler14> did you just say BUCKET?
[0:36:25] <ComicReliefHero> @FrostMass22 It depends on the kind of delivery. Mostly just clear objectives to the best degree possible. Urgent:would mean clearing it in a fast time slot.
[0:36:27] <%FrostMass22> I might be dumb because I never figured out what premium deliveries were
[0:36:39] <%Niney_Who> bring him his Burnt-disc of music
[0:36:42] <+Deekman> that's a thicc cd

[0:43:21] <%Madbearv> there's an anime coming out pat
[0:43:21] <ssks123> the fact that norman reedus liked so many shitpost tweets about being "vore daddy" and shit kills me
[0:43:22] <+Deekman> I can literally not believe Norman Reedus sons name is Mingus Reedus
[0:43:23] <ComicReliefHero> You gotta maintain that shit!
[0:43:24] <%deviljhojho_> SAVE US ITSUNO SAN
[0:43:28] <%wannabemoogle> Does this mean Paige gets two Thankgivings?
[0:43:29] <artoflec> Capcom said he could do either DMC5 or Dragons Dogma first and he chose DMC5 im pretty sure he said something like that
[0:43:29] <%Madbearv> so something is happening
[0:43:31] <red_blaster> Death Stranding's next update will tackle 'common requests'. What do you think they should add?
[0:43:32] <kvassimoto> Wolves travel in packs!
[0:43:34] <SomersaultJustice> breath of fire sequel you heard it here first LIVE ON STREAM
[0:43:35] <%Keyd00d> Capcom just said an unannounced game will be playable at Jump Festa
[0:43:36] <%connos_procrastination> cant wait for dogins dragma
[0:43:39] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I think he once said that if he wasn't working on DMC5 at the time, he would have wanted to make Dragons Dogma 2 @AngriestPat
[0:43:40] <+ekimthegib> Something might happen somewhere at some time
[0:43:42] <krabsan> Please let it have that dumb song in the main menu again
[0:43:44] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> in some interview I think
[0:43:44] <startstoprepeat> is this like how you don't know anything about re3make or actually
[0:43:45] <Artista_AF> zoneThink i wonder if you could use Void Outs to clear terrain?
[0:43:46] <Valegator> Dude Dragons Dogma in RE engine gets me moist

[0:43:50] <+RichAnvils> hopes at M-m-m-m-MAXIMUM

[0:43:51] <Austin0097> @red_blaster A mecha.
[0:43:54] <rytisone> If capcom desides to push more DMC sooner without Itsuno, I will be worried
[0:43:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Amazon Prime is apparently making an animated DMC show.
[0:44:02] <Waifu_KingExcede> I loved dragons dogma
[0:44:05] <%connos_procrastination> master works all cant go wrong
[0:44:07] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Wait, Norman Reedus actually likes all the Funky Fetus stuff? That's great

[0:45:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> mingus lucien reedus
[0:45:41] <Jeemukun> "Reedus was in a five-year relationship with supermodel Helena Christensen from 1998 to 2003. Despite reports to the contrary, the two were never married.[24][25] Together they have a son, Mingus Lucien Reedus (born October 13, 1999).[26][27] They have remained friends and shared joint custody of their son.

[0:45:53] <%linkster291> @AngriestPat The curse of the bad name had to be passed on before he could take the name Norman.

[1:00:53] <%connos_procrastination> darksiders died but we got DMCV so fuck it
[1:00:57] <%RNGbob> real bad gumbo
[1:00:59] <+idyota> can you snowboard in this game
[1:01:01] <artoflec> they already said genesis isn't replacing 4 NotLikeThis
[1:01:08] <%FrostMass22> @megabrogus Then what's the point?
[1:01:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> 2 wasn't even a prequel. it's technically an interquel.
[1:01:10] <TheArrow_> I played 2 for an hour and I was like, "wow this combat is like dmc" and then i kept playing and i was like "wow this combat is not like dmc"
[1:01:13] <ComicReliefHero> ゴ ゴ ゴゴ ゴ ゴ C R A ZY T A L K
[1:01:16] <blaggablag> @idyota Yes but only with anti gravity carts
[1:01:20] <+Sneakman98> I stole my name from Jet Set Radio
[1:01:21] <+plasticss> darksiders 2 was the most visually depressing game ever. just greys and brown colors
[1:01:22] <%Niney_Who> A Paleontologist is someone who investigates human history through excavation and exploring

[1:01:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> darksiders was anime God of War.
[1:01:37] <%connos_procrastination> a saw footage of dorksiders 3 and it looked baaad
[1:01:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The next one is good
[1:01:44] <%Meow0369> You're doing repeat missions
[1:01:44] <old_dog_god> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:01:45] <%mister___doctor> Darksiders 2 isnrad tho. Dont know about 3 though.
[1:01:52] <FutaSnek> @old_dog_god Impressive pogamid
[1:01:54] <startstoprepeat> evo devo's got some great stuff
[1:01:57] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I kinda enjoyed DS being Zelda, but Heavy Metal
[1:01:57] <Mendin> BUT BUILD MORE ROADS THO
[1:01:57] <Bigbossman91> the next one is worth getting to 4 stars
[1:01:57] <%Meow0369> they give way less when you repeat them, you can see if they're repeat by the score at the bottom
[1:02:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah Evo Devo's the shit
[1:02:02] <ComicReliefHero> You do. You're going to have to repair those ziplines eventually carciSmug
[1:02:05] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Share it with others :)
[1:02:07] <+ekimthegib> PROGRESS
[1:02:07] <artoflec> @mister___doctor 3's pretty great but it only runs well on PC. It's way better than that gun souls game they made afterward.
[1:02:09] <Nina96> @AngriestPat have u done all the Pizzas yet?
[1:02:11] <%Meow0369> Oh yeah this part

[1:02:17] <JoeNeutrino> Roads are the shit. Almost as awesome as zip lines.
[1:02:17] <%wannabemoogle> Edo Bedo
[1:02:19] <%megabrogus> whats worse is that they are making a Darksiders board game that you can only get if you buy the highest tier edition of genesis
[1:02:25] <Grim_kraken> EVO

[1:03:08] <Illiobillium> I wish there was an option to fuck with the samples.
[1:03:11] <blaggablag> You're full up on hematics right?
[1:03:11] <%iaraCatunda> @angriestpat are you doing all the sidequest???
[1:03:14] <al0nem0nster> remnant from the ashes, yeah.
[1:03:15] <SpellCatty> @AngriestPat Do you think the game'll have Sam ask somebody if something was true and they'll reply with a totally serious "I'm a frayed knot."
[1:03:16] <kvassimoto> mariaPew GET STRAPPED
[1:03:17] <+Deekman> catch you guys in the vod!
[1:03:18] <%connos_procrastination> santy sam
[1:03:19] <artoflec> yeah remnant, people were really positive about that game but negative about darksiders 3 from the same people but remnant was junk.
[1:03:22] <+DatGuyJimbo> this order sucks btw
[1:03:34] <ComicReliefHero> Hello future Deekman
[1:03:38] <+ekimthegib> Blood, cum, and bullets
[1:03:42] <BoneofMalkav> Are you an Evo or a Devo?
[1:03:43] <%connos_procrastination> rmnant and darksiders can fuck off tbh
[1:03:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, this order was all kinds of fucky
[1:03:50] <al0nem0nster> remnant had okay gameplay but no content.
[1:03:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hated it
[1:04:00] <+keyoray> @SpellCatty I hate you and love you at the same time

[1:11:11] <Mendin> Ah the volcanic pissfields
[1:11:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you know...I feel like the oxygen mask came too late in the game to be useful. Was only the one mission that required it.
[1:11:13] <ScreamLord> *fairly
[1:11:13] <JoeNeutrino> NEON SYMBOLISM
[1:11:13] <+ekimthegib> Only used the mask once in 80 hours

[1:11:24] <+plasticss> oh this place blows dick
[1:11:24] <%Meow0369> Crazy talk
[1:11:25] <artoflec> if its moving slower does that mean the timefall is less effective. Because they explain that its affect stops when it hits the ground.
[1:11:26] <blaggablag> Shit's getting real in 5 4 3

[1:16:06] <blaggablag> Pee on the ghosts to assert dominance. Do NOT break eye contact.
[1:16:07] <nukle0nik> perspective
[1:16:13] <%Meow0369> When orange appears you need to move closer to cut cord
[1:16:19] <+ekimthegib> Reedus is spooked
[1:16:21] <%Meow0369> Orange appears before cord cutting distance
[1:16:23] <katocrimson> death stranding 2 we need a chiral katana
[1:16:24] <%SvenHolgersson> apatBig SIGHT DISTANCE
[1:16:26] <JoeNeutrino> I never tried pissing on a BT. Does it do anything?
[1:16:38] <%Meow0369> Weird
[1:16:41] <+ekimthegib> they run away like you're pissing on them
[1:16:41] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Finished the story, and started grinding for the Platinum trophy, but my biggest disappointment with Death Stranding is that it isn't nearly as scary as I had hoped.
[1:16:42] <Isord> MonkaS
[1:16:45] <%Meow0369> I've never seen that pat you broke the game
[1:16:55] <astroPunkFunk> bts have been lifting
[1:17:02] <%abakkus> fuck them BTches up
[1:17:04] <blaggablag> I love the visual of the BTs but their whole nazghul screech gets old pretty quick
[1:17:10] <%Laecerelius> you passed by one I think
[1:17:12] <%Meow0369> Might be worth setting up a watchtower
[1:17:13] <Mendin> Un-Re-Kill Them All, Peter
[1:17:21] <+robert_edwards> there's only 4
[1:17:24] <+ekimthegib> scan the right side?
[1:17:31] <%GarbageNirvana> This area's off the network I thought
[1:17:34] <astroPunkFunk> im scared pat
[1:17:36] <+robert_edwards> you're carrying a fifth
[1:17:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Wouldn't be able to get a watchtower up
[1:17:54] <%Meow0369> I just cleared this entire area of BTs out
[1:18:06] <%Meow0369> So there were NO bts in the entire zone and I could just run around collecting it
[1:18:07] <+ekimthegib> that was a generous one
[1:18:09] <+I_Rafiki_x> How do you get the gold bag on your back?
[1:18:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I actually managed to sneak around these fucks
[1:18:19] <blaggablag> Cut the cord and then PUNCH THEM STRAIGHT IN THE NADS
[1:18:29] <+griffball13> why isn't that BT cutter standerd issue for everybody?
[1:18:33] <+ekimthegib> yeah, I tried that until I got caught
[1:18:33] <+necrocannibal2> are the bosses in this game good?
[1:18:37] <%Meow0369> @griffball13 New invention
[1:18:39] <nukle0nik> takes a while for Mama to figure it out
[1:18:44] <%Meow0369> @griffball13 Like SUPER new
[1:18:44] <Nina96> there okay i guess
[1:18:47] <+ekimthegib> exactly
[1:18:50] <Isord> because it uses Sam's blood
[1:18:50] <MaeMae94> yeah the cuffs are new
[1:18:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they ARE cool looking
[1:18:54] <%AbnormalVoid> what if a prompt comes up and it's just like "Cut Foreskin"?
[1:18:55] <+UrielCobalt> Just came to say that Rich Evan's opinion on Star Wars is shit btw, and he only has his opinion now because he is butthurt that he got flack for the mob he and his buddies encouraged against pre disney sequels Star Wars. He indeed took it very seriously before them, and everyone remembers.
[1:18:56] <$antibonehurtingjuice> oh boy just you wait
[1:18:56] <JoeNeutrino> They're much less dangerous than they first appear
[1:18:57] <vampireinarm> I just thought of something, If time fall just accelerates time and trees are basically forever, why arent there a bunch of giant forests all over?
[1:19:00] <Mister_McDerp> the REAL boss is the environment
[1:19:00] <TheArrow_> yoji shinkawa is a god
[1:19:02] <+plasticss> I hated the combat in this game lmao.
[1:19:04] <Nina96> just big hit boxes really
[1:19:05] <%WhereIsWill> these BTs gettin REKT
[1:19:09] <%wannabemoogle> The Cthulu gold skull Lion was sick
[1:19:10] <+ekimthegib> Just kind of blood sponges
[1:19:18] <%Meow0369> big boy

[1:19:38] <%Meow0369> he'll love it
[1:19:39] <Mechazoic_Era> they ate their ghost veggies and got big and strong
[1:19:39] <TheArrow_> yoji shinkawa should start his own studio, with hookers and blackjack
[1:19:43] <Crimpson> I personally think they should have put a duration on how many times you can use your cuffs to kill. It just makes dealing with BT's way to easy.
[1:19:45] <Mendin> Make an alt-save and aggro them you coward
[1:19:49] <$antibonehurtingjuice> theyre A posing
[1:19:50] <mayorrev> thats what pat said when he met paige HOHOHOHOHO

[1:21:09] <Crimpson> Throw your pee at him
[1:21:13] <%Meow0369> This area sucks even more later in the game
[1:21:18] <42nfl19> maybe something more like nades or a GUN!
[1:21:18] <al0nem0nster> few grenades should do it.
[1:21:18] <%Maids4lyfe> just kill it with weapons
[1:21:19] <Notterr> @AngriestPat can you explain BTs please?
[1:21:20] <MaeMae94> take a shit next to him
[1:21:34] <+necrocannibal2> so the game is called Death Stranding because the dead are stranded

[1:27:15] <%abakkus> with my stand, [PISS GRENADE] it was simple
[1:27:15] <CelioHogane> @vampireinarm Woolie got owned by one
[1:27:16] <tigerfang86> the GENIUS KOJUMBO is right, pat is truly the greatest death strander in history
[1:27:20] <Isord> Tentacle sharks are the tutorial area bosses
[1:27:24] <ssks123> they died on top of each other

[1:28:38] <%AbnormalVoid> There's 5, you just need 4
[1:28:42] <CelioHogane> Collect all four 5/5 packets.
[1:28:44] <DrGasMax> What the fuck even is this building? Why is it in America?
[1:28:47] <karl_rex> The vibes on that place are rancid
[1:28:49] <%Meow0369> The 5th was inside you the whole time
[1:28:57] <extradopeness> If only Norman took his pants all the way off to pee... Then he'd be Feels-GoodMan.
[1:28:59] <+ekimthegib> The real death stranding was the friends we made along the way
[1:29:03] <%Meow0369> That place gets WAY worse later in the game

[1:29:28] <Swish19XX> BT stands for Bacon Tamato
[1:29:30] <+fingalights> Eh, its fine
[1:29:30] <%Meow0369> I like the quad rocket launcher for BTs
[1:29:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> unless you're using a RIOT shotgun
[1:29:33] <%crazyspartan214> I could go for a BLT sanndwich right now ;)
[1:29:33] <ne_zha> We truly were the Death Stranding produced by Hideo Kojima starring Ride's Norman Reedus, Review Copy Provided By PlayStation
[1:29:36] <Nested_Dreams> Are the crystals measured in centigrams or in chiralgrams?
[1:29:37] <%radda343> riot shotgun is for people
[1:29:39] <blaggablag> I mean you CAN kill people you just gotta get them to the crematorium later
[1:29:39] <+fingalights> RIOT
[1:29:39] <vampireinarm> uh oh i accidentally shotgunned ALL the people
[1:29:45] <Mister_McDerp> the shotgun is of course the most american weapon
[1:29:48] <Mendin> Are we evo? NO, we are devo!
[1:29:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> Evo Devola
[1:29:53] <+ekimthegib> Pretty sure this is the last person
[1:30:01] <Isord> it is
[1:30:02] <CelioHogane> I wonder how a genocide run looks in Death Stranding...
[1:30:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Axe body spray your packages for max ranks
[1:30:04] <%Meow0369> Pat are you not wearing your power gloves
[1:30:04] <%Laecerelius> Look at those super fucked up containers
[1:30:04] <NotHereToStream> you want to max out this prepper for good reasons
[1:30:08] <nukle0nik> the last real person
[1:30:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Let us leave this crater. It is a silly place.
[1:30:10] <MaeMae94> There's a hotspring nearby btw
[1:30:15] <N1netbattler> Idk Pat if I got hit with blood or piss bullets I'd just give up and run
[1:30:17] <BunnyEmperor> Gotta make sure they smell good
[1:30:19] <Isord> We are on the beginning of the final stretch
[1:30:20] <+ekimthegib> Them Logan gloves
[1:30:21] <%Meow0369> You're keeping a spare power gloves...?
[1:30:41] <%Meow0369> It said it was repaired I've never seen that before Ignore me

[1:31:35] <%abakkus> paige wont be happy with a skeleton in that condition
[1:31:36] <CelioHogane> Should've used Gold, Gold doesn't rust

[1:32:12] <Valegator> It felt like butterflies caressing my naked body.
[1:32:15] <CelioHogane> @Isord yeah actually, Gold DOES NOT react to oxigen, so Gold actually never rusts
[1:32:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you're gonna love her rewards.
[1:32:21] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> this one is really good
[1:32:29] <%Meow0369> Take those glasses off
[1:32:30] <+ekimthegib> This'll make the shotgun blush if I remember correctly
[1:32:33] <CelioHogane> Ironically building a golden armor would be super timefall resistant
[1:32:37] <%wannabemoogle> Do they have their own afterlife or do we get to share it?
[1:32:53] <%crazyspartan214> Jesus was actually in the dino era and rode a T-rex
[1:32:55] <%abakkus> ssss

[1:33:59] <%pabstblueriven> pabstblueriven subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! I'm not sure why but Death Stranding reminds me a lot of Stephen King's "Dark Tower" series. Maybe it's the lonely tone, the glorification of this one dude, or the state of the world.
[1:34:01] <Jrocy247> GRENADE LAUNCHER

[1:34:35] <%J_Papa> I found this grenade launcher schematic in 400 million year old soil
[1:34:36] <Mister_McDerp> DNA IS A STRAND

[1:35:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 35m.
[1:35:56] <%Rumbutt> So if dinos went extinct from a death stranding, does that mean they were around less than 65 million years ago? since the timefall would fuck up or dating mechanisms?
[1:35:58] <%Meow0369> Oh my god wait is the point of no return even closer than I thought?
[1:36:01] <%joylent_blue> N1netbattler yes and no
[1:36:03] <%Laecerelius> Mama fused her soul into her sister or something liek that

[1:36:25] <N1netbattler> Oh wild
[1:36:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> He's close enough that I'd want to see him go BEYOND the point of no return this stream. But that depends on him.
[1:36:34] <%Meow0369> @Zaphire_Saucypants Point of no return is after you get that last one up and I can't remember if you can repair it as soon as you go back to heartman
[1:36:37] <Railgun5> @AngriestPat Get EvoDevo to 4-starts

[1:42:59] <%J_Papa> Got enough bandwidth for like 2 more ziplines
[1:43:04] <CelioHogane> I am on the not smartest part.
[1:43:05] <ScreamLord> Speaking of Shouts, look at this High Hrothgar/Throat of the World shit
[1:43:09] <%wannabemoogle> Our hive mind IQ gets evened out
[1:43:11] <%Divryne> Moderate Growl.
[1:43:12] <zenith0111> Kojima and Low Roar met Kojima at the first showing of Death Stranding and hit it off. So Kojima put Low Roars entire discography on here
[1:43:14] <%crazyspartan214> we are all smart in our own way
[1:43:16] <Sunstalker> How is this ingame music? Kojima vadeDERP

[1:43:19] <%abakkus> out hive mind iq is graded on a curve
[1:43:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'm not that smart. I think but I get distracted so I'm not sure if I am.

[1:43:47] <+necrocannibal2> @wydamn we're connected stranding stranded strands
[1:43:56] <%Takreth> he fought some ghosts and delivered some stuff and now is building infrastructure
[1:43:58] <Mendin> Pat drink your MONSTER
[1:43:58] <%Takreth> for America
[1:44:02] <Sunstalker> Pat, would you love to see a Man vs Wild game on this engine? vadeLaugh
[1:44:05] <%thegreenbenis> DRINK YOUR MONSTER
[1:44:06] <+griffball13> man the right music can make anything cooler then it should be
[1:44:09] <CelioHogane> The true strand is The Baz tear lines.
[1:44:13] <%Valdorick> Man, I hope Breath of the Wild 2 lets you set up sick Shieka Zipline Tech
[1:44:18] <%wydamn> @necrocannibal2 That rhymes with hand
[1:44:25] <%Laecerelius> I hope BotW2 has a hookshot of some sort
[1:44:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Truly we must never let the Delivery Man's sacrifice be in vain.
[1:44:26] <%wannabemoogle> And fight ghosts with piss and poo
[1:44:27] <tigerfang86> CHUG CHUG CHUG
[1:44:28] <+ekimthegib> Been listening to this game's soundtrack lately, it's pretty good
[1:44:30] <%SvenHolgersson> INTERACTIVE GAMEPLAY
[1:44:31] <%thegreenbenis> What if the strands were the friends we made along the way? @AngriestPat
[1:44:31] <kvassimoto> mariaWoke DrinkPurple
[1:44:32] <nukle0nik> wow
[1:44:32] <%deviljhojho_> remember to consume monster energy and watch Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC
[1:44:33] <Meekest> Pog
[1:44:34] <%crazyspartan214> nice
[1:44:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> drowning in butthole
[1:44:36] <MaeMae94> PogChamp
[1:44:41] <%Laecerelius> Perfect!
[1:44:44] <Nested_Dreams> Kreygasm
[1:44:48] <nukle0nik> truly nailed it
[1:44:52] <+ekimthegib> some zippin music
[1:44:54] <Bigbossman91> shame you can't use the music player in the game outside your private room
[1:44:59] <%megabrogus> nano machines son
[1:45:01] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> monster is being sold mostly in 250 ml cans over here, only one grocery shop near me still has the original
[1:45:05] <Mister_McDerp> ZIP ROADMAN
[1:45:07] <Jrocy247> @AngriestPat I kinda wish the game would let you play the music manually so the game won't be so quiet most of the time
[1:45:10] <+ekimthegib> this games' about ruckin, truckin, and zippin
[1:45:10] <zenith0111> @bigbossman91 If you upgrade structures you can
[1:45:13] <%J_Papa> Nice timing
[1:45:14] <+necrocannibal2> neat
[1:45:19] <%crazyspartan214> Ho ho ho motherfuckers
[1:45:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I would have liked a headphones unlock so I could play the songs while playing.
[1:45:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Nice aerial shot of the lab on the way
[1:45:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> I watched Ride with Norman Reedus once. it had Sean Patrick Flannery.
[1:45:24] <%wannabemoogle> Norman you got one hell of a grip
[1:45:25] <%thegreenbenis> I LOVE FUCKING SNOOOOOW
[1:45:25] <%wydamn> I can't wait until this is on PC, and someone makes a mod that constantly reminds you to drink your verification can.
[1:45:30] <seycheles> huge truckin
[1:45:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ekimthegib and Mom S Ranking
[1:45:32] <%AbnormalVoid> who shovels the snow off of heartman's roof?
[1:45:33] <Ultimatefool> Looking at this environment is making me shiver anyone else
[1:45:35] <krabsan> TAKE A PISS IN HEARTMANS JACUZZI
[1:45:35] <Monkeyweed21> PISS IN THE LAKE
[1:45:39] <Isord> Monster in 250ml cans?! What is this heresy?!
[1:45:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> like say...a walkman...
[1:45:42] <%MightyMaxT> Okay, so BTs are the ghosts flying around. Are the monster bosses ALSO BTs, just a different class or are they something else?
[1:45:58] <%joylent_blue> i understand not wanting the player to have the music all the time, so that when it does play it has more impact, but you should be able to unlock it after beating the game or something
[1:45:59] <+ConLin_Arts_> someone will mod the Monster into gamergirl pee
[1:45:59] <Isord> @MightyMaxT yes
[1:46:03] <%wannabemoogle> He's fun
[1:46:04] <%wydamn> @MightyMaxT they're different types, I think?
[1:46:04] <blaggablag> We'll ahve a heart to heart if you will
[1:46:06] <%megabrogus> is that a landing pod of some description at heartmans lab
[1:46:09] <+ekimthegib> probably take apart the lab's zipline
[1:46:10] <al0nem0nster> its better to think of the ghosts as the lure of an angler fish.
[1:46:10] <GuiserGestalt> Brett the hitman hartman
[1:46:10] <KnightAsteran> @mightymaxt big ones are called catchers I think
[1:46:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> @isord the cans are tiny and cute
[1:46:13] <sithri> lol that fucking ladder
[1:46:15] <HorribleHog> BT stands for beached things right?
[1:46:17] <%wannabemoogle> Also his pad is sick
[1:46:17] <+necrocannibal2> they're dinosaur BTs
[1:46:20] <Mister_McDerp> what if the boss bts are dinosaur ghosts
[1:46:21] <studleydoorite> this environment is less snowy than the one outside my window rn
[1:46:21] <KnightAsteran> yes Hog
[1:46:23] <Bigbossman91> @zenith0111 yeah but you can't if you're trucking, biking or just walking
[1:46:24] <%thegreenbenis> CAN YOU GET A SANTA HAT FOR BB? @AngriestPat
[1:46:26] <Isord> yes they are Beached Things
[1:46:28] <CelioHogane> @HorribleHog yes
[1:46:32] <Grim_kraken> Hopefullly they'll add a music player while exploring later
[1:46:38] <%MightyMaxT> Thanks, chat
[1:46:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> BT = buttholes touched.
[1:46:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Paleo and Geo also have stuff for her
[1:46:47] <HorribleHog> That to me seems like it would encompass all subtypes of BT, animal or humanoid
[1:46:57] <KingGoblodyte> What's up, @AngriestPat ?
[1:46:59] <%wydamn> @thegreenbenis I want to see Norman put a Santa Hat on the top of BB's pod.
[1:47:05] <DashXero> Heartman has a nice house...
[1:47:08] <KnightAsteran> only the hoomans have the BT ghosts
[1:47:18] <+ekimthegib> Your cargo is showing, how embarrassing
[1:47:23] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kojimbo give Lou a santa hat!!
[1:47:26] <Isord> PAT
[1:47:30] <Isord> HEARTMAN
[1:47:33] <VidulaSaix> Walked right past the quest LUL
[1:47:35] <seycheles> patologist
[1:47:39] <%J_Papa> Not talking to Heartman?
[1:47:42] <tigerfang86> Q U E S T
[1:47:46] <Mister_McDerp> wear protection on your package pat, where is the cover?
[1:47:48] <$HyperionXV> sidequest time
[1:47:53] <%Strider222> noo
[1:47:55] <%wannabemoogle> Yay more science
[1:48:02] <VidulaSaix> Call Heartman hes crying FeelsBadMan
[1:48:03] <+ekimthegib> heartman's heart is broken
[1:48:04] <+griffball13> cover is broken
[1:48:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shouldnt take long, this area is kind with the evo devo missions
[1:48:08] <Grim_kraken> SeemsGood
[1:48:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> Thumbs-Up-Likesman
[1:48:22] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Pat: I defy you, Heartman!
[1:48:25] <JoeNeutrino> Sub-Textman
[1:48:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz I kept revisiting and getting more evo devo stuff REALLY quickly.
[1:48:27] <%J_Papa> Pat did you forget about Thermal Pads?
[1:48:27] <zenith0111> Heartman 😠
[1:48:32] <%megabrogus> honestly thought you were gonna repair your broken down ass stuff first but okay
[1:48:41] <Mister_McDerp> cover died for our sins FeelsBadMan
[1:48:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> thermal pads suck
[1:48:47] <%FrostMass22> Pat likes his ass broken
[1:48:47] <+ekimthegib> I never hit circle mid zip
[1:49:00] <+Javaa01> Though he's close to level 4, so you shouldn't need to haul THAT much stuff to get him to like you
[1:49:04] <MaeMae94> thermal pads are to trade electricity for stamina, which is pointless because monster energy is too good
[1:49:06] <NinjaTB> Happy Turkeyday errybody
[1:49:10] <Daxalog> Maybe it started here
[1:49:10] <ssks123> for the private room maybe?
[1:49:10] <KingGoblodyte> Thermal pads? Is it Paige's shark week already?
[1:49:12] <%J_Papa> They reduce the effects of timefall snow, they're ok if you can fit them
[1:49:15] <Illiobillium> Ok American
[1:49:16] <+ekimthegib> You're in the wrong neighborhood
[1:49:19] <bigbrothergannon> how long has this stump stream been going on?
[1:49:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 1h30m
[1:49:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> electrical drain on thermal pads is too fast to be worth anything imo.
[1:49:42] <Sunstalker> This game have super long ziplines makes me think HZD engine is going to allow flight in the next game. vadeThink
[1:49:47] <%VioletHeart> VioletHeart subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[1:49:57] <bigbrothergannon> thanks man
[1:49:58] <+ekimthegib> If you get lvl 3 battery pack the pads are pretty good
[1:50:04] <%J_Papa> Pat has an extra battery, just using 2 pads won't drain battery much at all
[1:50:16] <%J_Papa> But they aren't necessary
[1:50:16] <+griffball13> how could you make a fool of pat
[1:50:21] <%Meow0369> Get in the car and move it pat
[1:50:23] <%wannabemoogle> TRUCK
[1:50:23] <xiidrifty> that truck makes me angry
[1:50:24] <%Meow0369> for the love of god
[1:50:35] <+ekimthegib> the truck adds character
[1:50:50] <%wydamn> God I love that little squeal noise the otter hood makes when it deflates.
[1:50:52] <%Meow0369> Is that character Navi?
[1:50:56] <%Laecerelius> Truckin' time!
[1:51:00] <Ultimatefool> How is Sam so STRONG?!?!
[1:51:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> now we doin pure deliveries, so we don't need any o that combat shit
[1:51:10] <%megabrogus> if the truck makes you angry imagine how the geologist feels
[1:51:10] <%Piemen99> TRUNKING
[1:51:11] <+ekimthegib> get the truck to do a flip
[1:51:17] <tigerfang86> who needs combat
[1:51:22] <xiidrifty> good point, i feel bad for the geologist
[1:51:23] <nebro5000> happy thanks giving to the Elmo and the humans that care for the elmo, and everyone watching the stream !
[1:51:25] <tigerfang86> when you could be TRUCKIN
[1:51:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hahaha
[1:51:39] <HorribleHog> no shit
[1:51:40] <%Laecerelius> Pat's soul is weighed down by excess cargo
[1:51:43] <HeroToxiko> LESSON
[1:51:45] <%joylent_blue> minmax your deliveries
[1:51:47] <bigbrothergannon> hoarder
[1:51:47] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> anymore pizza deliveries?
[1:51:55] <blaggablag> Them goblins weight you down
[1:51:57] <%wydamn> Pat is pregnant with Cargo

[1:52:01] <valriot> LUL
[1:52:05] <%SvenHolgersson> THE ZODIAC KILLER
[1:52:08] <redrins> if this game had cold drinks pat would be taking them with him even in here
[1:52:08] <artificiallynatural> ted cruz??
[1:52:08] <%Capta1n_H3nry> PATRICK CRUZ
[1:52:12] <HorribleHog> you're like that melentia from majula
[1:52:13] <+necrocannibal2> Ted Cruz LUL
[1:52:15] <%deviljhojho_> dont read it, i wasted years on that series
[1:52:16] <%deviljhojho_> fuck
[1:52:30] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat is NOT related to the Zodiac Killer, confirmed.
[1:52:31] <valriot> Ted Cruz looks like kappa Kappa
[1:52:31] <%SvenHolgersson> @deviljhojho_ which series?
[1:52:33] <Isord> @AngriestPat Just watch the Dark Tower movie
[1:52:33] <Maverick2736> it's great, what chu' talking about
[1:52:34] <Mister_McDerp> I can't believe Ted Cruz got away with killing those people
[1:52:35] <Isord> Kappa
[1:52:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> jesus, that truck
[1:52:44] <%deviljhojho_> @SvenHolgersson The dark tower. It didn't stick the landing
[1:52:44] <%wannabemoogle> My Friend was so made when he finished that series
[1:52:44] <+necrocannibal2> someone needs to put Stephen King back on coke
[1:52:46] <xiidrifty> give them likes
[1:52:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck that truck.
[1:52:49] <+ekimthegib> I eventually got down to just carrying cargo, and nothing else
[1:52:53] <TikanZK> look at these fuckin casual porters
[1:52:56] <HeroToxiko> the worlds of dark tower are linked by special kids, like the bridge babies
[1:53:04] <%wydamn> Man, if there was a Dark Tower video game, I'd want it to be like Death Stranding in tone and mechanics
[1:53:05] <nukle0nik> casual porters, they don't even have a BB
[1:53:07] <%J_Papa> Anyone know where i can watch or download Jo Jo? Crunchyroll is censored so screw that
[1:53:11] <Valegator> drive it off the clif
[1:53:14] <Austin0097> Pa "Trick" Cruz, Pat isn't related to Ted Cruz... He IS Ted Cruz.
[1:53:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ewwwww mats
[1:53:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Push that truck down the mountain
[1:53:24] <Maverick2736> the Dark Tower movie blows in comparison to the books. It's like Shyamalamadingdong's Last Airbender movie incomparison to the Avatar tv show
[1:53:30] <artificiallynatural> man those boxes are in terrible condition
[1:53:31] <%FrostMass22> @j_papa Rhymes with Irate Kay
[1:53:33] <+ekimthegib> Once the roads are done mats are almost useless
[1:53:34] <Maverick2736> don't watch that shit
[1:53:39] <%deviljhojho_> yeah that dark tower movie was botched so bad its unreal
[1:53:48] <nukle0nik> lookit that stuff coming down the river lol
[1:53:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's a shame cuz I like Idris Elba
[1:53:51] <%wannabemoogle> What Avatar Movie/s
[1:53:53] <%megabrogus> @J_Papa the censorship is extremely rare
[1:53:57] <+ekimthegib> I think those were porters
[1:54:04] <$Mothman742> @j_papa kissanime or kickassanime sites are good
[1:54:06] <+necrocannibal2> I'm surprised Dark Tower isn't a TV series already
[1:54:17] <Mister_McDerp> good
[1:54:21] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat just like a real american
[1:54:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> don't need any o that shit right now
[1:54:22] <ssks123> you can never have too much GUN
[1:54:26] <vampireinarm> didnt dark tower get a not so great movie recently
[1:54:28] <%Meow0369> Wait til you get the quad rocket launcher
[1:54:32] <%wydamn> I've basically erased that movie from my memory
[1:54:34] <+necrocannibal2> are you also carrying guns in the game?
[1:54:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> taken up that sweet, sweet cargo space.

[1:54:45] <%J_Papa> @Mothman742 i'll try them
[1:54:46] <al0nem0nster> just give the books to japan and let them make anime of it.
[1:54:49] <Picia000123> Man, each time I switch to Pat's stream, he is on a zipline
[1:54:55] <+ekimthegib> I do wish you could reverse zip trajectory
[1:55:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> tis a sign.

[1:56:27] <al0nem0nster> wonder how long it takes a body part to be covered in timefall for it to just melt into fs
[1:56:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh that's right, no backpack cover.
[1:56:35] <al0nem0nster> dust*
[1:56:35] <%J_Papa> Maybe we should release whatever is in that can into the atmosphere
[1:56:46] <+ekimthegib> I love how reedus is covered head to toe in timesnow, with no ill effects
[1:56:47] <+Nanocomputer> no thermo pads?
[1:56:48] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat So is Time Snow worse than Timefall or something?
[1:56:51] <+Javaa01> When the containers stop glowing you can stop spraying them
[1:56:55] <+griffball13> I have to wonder does that container spray just reverse time
[1:56:56] <%wannabemoogle> Still can't get over Appa's reveal "It Floats"
[1:57:00] <karl_rex> NOT THE GUCCI BACKPACK!
[1:57:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Get another one?
[1:57:02] <+necrocannibal2> but why
[1:57:04] <waifoong98> !uptime
[1:57:04] <sqointus> !uptime
[1:57:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 57m.
[1:57:09] <DashXero> What does timesnow do differently?
[1:57:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> drizzle/storm/snow/white out.
[1:57:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> I just joined what did I miss
[1:57:19] <artificiallynatural> why would anyone live up there in the snow
[1:57:25] <al0nem0nster> ....and now im thinking of keanu just strolling through the shit not noticing.
[1:57:28] <VidulaSaix> They're cool Kappa
[1:57:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gets progressively worse and worse
[1:57:34] <%Ner234> Wow lewd
[1:57:36] <%daveglhf> the container repair spray should have been axe
[1:57:40] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat is that part of her secret cosplay?
[1:57:45] <+necrocannibal2> yeah what kind of idiot would live in a country full of snow
[1:57:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Happy Thanksgiving Paige! Pat already had his last month so none for him
[1:57:48] <valriot> Paige showing feet? PogChamp
[1:57:48] <xiidrifty> Realistically it would be way harder to avoid Timesnow as it can get pushed wherever, as opposed to rain, I think
[1:57:50] <JoeNeutrino> Keanu's body is on the Beach.
[1:57:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm pretty excited to see how Keanu does in Cyberpunk actually.
[1:57:57] <+ekimthegib> I think these guys live up here because they're researching beach bullshit

[1:58:31] <%AbnormalVoid> more like Fartman
[1:58:31] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Good thing this game doesn't take place in a area with hurricanes.
[1:58:34] <%AbnormalVoid> gottem
[1:58:47] <ScreamLord> @DashXero if I had to guess Time Snowflakes probably last longer than Timefall droplets because the Chirilium isn't washed away the instant it hit something...I think

[1:58:55] <+talon84> I thought your nemesis was Big Tall Man
[1:58:58] <%daisyyyy> Then why is timesnow worse
[1:59:02] <+ekimthegib> I love it when the packages hit the ceiling
[1:59:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> All these -Man characters are making me think of megaman

[2:00:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> eat his kneecaps, Pat.
[2:00:40] <Clyderso> but did you win?
[2:00:42] <+necrocannibal2> does backpack cover protect from Timefall?
[2:00:42] <al0nem0nster> ....we joke but then again, superman, batman, wonder woman, aquaman, iron man, etc
[2:00:44] <HorribleHog> Fighting Paige doesn't count
[2:00:44] <Illiobillium> Pat using his low center of gravity.
[2:00:45] <%Laecerelius> Pat's so small Conan can't reach him!
[2:00:46] <%joylent_blue> he climbed that one guy and bit his ear
[2:00:47] <%kewlmyc> I feel Pat would lose any fight scenario
[2:00:47] <ssks123> Being short gives you easier access to the nut shot
[2:00:50] <katocrimson> headbutt his cock

[2:01:00] <%FrostMass22> Normal Proportions-Man
[2:01:00] <%MightyMaxT> I honestly like the names for people, like The Doctor or The Archeologist. They feel more memorable than if they were say Sarah or Jeff
[2:01:00] <%J_Papa> You couldn't knock Pat over
[2:01:03] <%AngriestAngryArtist> the taller the opponent the closer his dick to your fist D:
[2:01:08] <metabot64> having a fat cock is a weakness
[2:01:11] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Just punch a dick and he goes down!

[2:04:28] <Mister_McDerp> become as santa
[2:04:32] <%FrostMass22> Not being able to change your suit color until after the end is a missed opportunity
[2:04:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...but the red isn't bright enough for a full santa.
[2:04:38] <zenith0111> It's me MAN-MAN
[2:04:42] <+necrocannibal2> just make the planes from backpack cover
[2:04:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> also clouds work like EMPs

[2:05:05] <%FrostMass22> Short Orb-Man
[2:05:07] <Cruel_Tentacles> Aeroplanes > feet.
[2:05:08] <+Javaa01> The clouds are MADE of timefall, anything would fall apart going through them
[2:05:09] <%J_Papa> Also the suit still changes to white/grey in the snowy areas, bad for Santa cosplay
[2:05:12] <HorribleHog> mountains are at a height that most things can fly at
[2:05:12] <%Maids4lyfe> @Valegator can't get over the clouds to get to space
[2:05:15] <sqointus> Bombs away, in my plastic aeroplane.

[2:05:43] <%Maids4lyfe> fucking Higgs too
[2:05:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> @megabrogus rain gets chiral particles from the clouds, ages what it touches and then becomes normal water. Or, in other words, "shut up it's cool tho, stands man"
[2:05:46] <valriot> There should be a part where you carry Deadman

[2:08:04] <zenith0111> LUL
[2:08:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @zenith0111 Say "careful! he can bite"
[2:08:05] <+necrocannibal2> is that a challenge?
[2:08:07] <Maverick2736> He bites and farts. At the same time. Through his mouth.
[2:08:08] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> shout "GET AWAY FROM MY DANGER ZONE" in a shrill high-pitched voice
[2:08:09] <%thebiganxiety> Tell them to piss off
[2:08:11] <%Rumbutt> Petting people's pets without asking is fucking stupid and rude, and you should tell them that
[2:08:13] <%J_Papa> I don't like people touching my stuff, go away
[2:08:14] <%Maids4lyfe> say your dog has demonic possession
[2:08:15] <%Kazuhira_Boat> You will get the dog herpes fam
[2:08:16] <%FrostMass22> Feline leukemia is contagious
[2:08:18] <metabot64> just say he has ultra aids
[2:08:19] <%connos_procrastination> he has CANINE AIDS
[2:08:19] <Mister_McDerp> give him one of those vests that says not to touch
[2:08:20] <Demon_chann> yeah that correct
[2:08:23] <%wydamn> You don't need to give him aids, just spray aids into his mouth every morning.
[2:08:24] <blaggablag> His STAND is coarse and gets everywhere
[2:08:31] <DashXero> If it's a kid, just go "what are you? Stupid? Don't pet dogs you don't know."
[2:08:32] <%Valdorick> "My dog has herpes, you should get checked."

[2:08:40] <GeltonZ> I love how all of Pat's answers are "Tell a really horrible lie!"
[2:08:43] <KingGoblodyte> What if they don't have a dick?
[2:08:46] <TikanZK> train your dog to get mad as fuck at strangers petting him :)
[2:08:46] <%SvenHolgersson> Tell that child his dick will fall off if he even LOOKS at your dog
[2:08:47] <Clyderso> "my dog hates you, and told me to not let you touch him"
[2:08:47] <JoeNeutrino> This is my dog, Dick-Rotman.
[2:08:49] <+spiceyweasle> rabies+aids= RAIDS which is basically zombies
[2:08:55] <Jrocy247> I'd just say "Don't touch my dog without asking please"
[2:08:55] <+ekimthegib> My dog is covered in ticks
[2:08:55] <Valegator> @AngriestPat Why do I get a feeling that Kojima wants to sell me keychains?
[2:08:56] <startstoprepeat> "my dog's in heat so don't pet it unless you're willing to go all the way"
[2:08:58] <metabot64> what if youer a girl?
[2:09:01] <Tiddlebonk> When I used to walk dogs for pet rescues I begged strangers to pet them. A more socialized doggy = more adoptable doggy.
[2:09:02] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> @KingGoblodyte It'll make you GROW a dick, and then it'll fall off.
[2:09:03] <%megabrogus> you can also let the dog get its love

[2:28:48] <KnightAsteran> 21 minutes
[2:28:48] <+ekimthegib> @zenith0111 It's more that they say it to explain why a raccoon dying doesn't cause nuclear explosions, it just makes the whole mass extinction thing weirder
[2:28:49] <+Yakobro> LUL
[2:28:52] <%deviljhojho_> hmmmmm
[2:28:53] <Hydrapissed> hes DeD

[2:28:55] <%Laecerelius> Just wait a few minutes
[2:28:56] <%Meow0369> @thebiganxiety Right now it's said that it seems to cause or correlate with the end of the world or some shit
[2:28:57] <Crimpson> fast 3 mins
[2:28:59] <%xcompleasedad> @thebiganxiety It's basically a god of death

[2:29:14] <%Meow0369> Point of no return incoming
[2:29:15] <al0nem0nster> EE = magic entity that brings about mass extinction
[2:29:19] <+fingalights> @Soulbishop no? Maybe?
[2:29:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> big danger
[2:29:25] <RyuuAoi> We getting into voodoo now?

[2:29:43] <%Soulbishop> But Diehardman reptriated too
[2:29:45] <%Teintstein> so we've got BTs, BBs, EEs, DOOMS, what other bullshit acronyms are now crowding out useful information in our heads
[2:29:46] <+necrocannibal2> @KnightAsteran isn't Die-Hardman a repatriate?
[2:29:47] <%SvenHolgersson> BT + EE = ET
[2:29:47] <%dreamfillah> dreamfillah subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:29:51] <zenith0111> @ekimthegib Also just because they can't cause voidouts does not imply they never had beaches

[2:30:16] <%Keyd00d> aww
[2:30:16] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat warning theres terrorists along the way
[2:30:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I hope this is a long stream

[2:30:26] <Nina96> magic duh
[2:30:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS FIIIIIIIIINE
[2:30:27] <ssks123> they excavated it and took a photo i think
[2:30:28] <NotHereToStream> chiral magic thats how
[2:30:28] <CelioHogane> THE DINOSAUR WAS INMORTAL
[2:30:29] <TheArrow_> i died at the very end and had to restart the whole thing
[2:30:32] <%Keyd00d> He took it
[2:30:32] <Mister_McDerp> ITS AN ETERNAL DINOSAUR
[2:30:36] <%miguelrod777> STRANDS THATS HOW
[2:30:37] <+ekimthegib> beach fuckery that's how
[2:30:37] <Amasepyt> The lady from chapter 6 had the dinosaur photos
[2:30:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz we gonna get in it tonight
[2:30:39] <%megabrogus> there were clearly humans in the photo
[2:30:40] <RyuuAoi> Strap that zip! When a problem comes along, you must zip it! @angriestpat
[2:30:41] <al0nem0nster> ....it was a corpse that didn't rot, like mama
[2:30:41] <vampireinarm> he literally said some data survived
[2:30:41] <%SvenHolgersson> Yea IDIOTS
[2:30:43] <%xcompleasedad> @MaeMae94 If you have a safe house, you can take materials to it to build it wherever
[2:30:44] <redrins> nessie bet
[2:30:44] <%Soulbishop> Fragile I thought was a repatriate too?
[2:30:47] <Grim_kraken> Because kojima!!
[2:30:50] <+TrevIn3Dimensions> The Ziplines are pretty damn cool ngl @AngriestPat
[2:30:50] <%Meow0369> @Soulbishop Nope
[2:30:50] <%Keyd00d> He said it was frozen in time
[2:30:54] <BunnyEmperor> he found the pic on the dinosaurs twitter
[2:30:55] <+fingalights> Every question has a logical realistic answer
[2:30:55] <waifoong98> immortal dino didn't have feather Kappa
[2:30:56] <%Keyd00d> Pay attention
[2:30:57] <%wydamn> He downloaded it from the network, the dinosaur was frozen in time and didn't decay.
[2:30:59] <%Meow0369> @Soulbishop She's a higher DOOMS than sam
[2:30:59] <%Soulbishop> She just got dooms
[2:31:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Soulbishop nope. Just higher DOOMS level than Sam.
[2:31:01] <big_chugnus> Kojima really out here making the only black guy the main villians
[2:31:02] <Mendin> Fragile has high-level DOOMS, not necessarily repatriation
[2:31:04] <nukle0nik> why?
[2:31:06] <Daxalog> Does this mean that there were Dino Repatriots doing deliveries for Die Hard Dino?
[2:31:07] <sirrice77> @Soulbishop No she only had advanced DOOMS
[2:31:08] <Habblewater> Doesn't decompose, like Mama
[2:31:09] <%eazer__dexterous> eazer__dexterous subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:31:12] <$antibonehurtingjuice> w-why
[2:31:13] <RyuuAoi> DINO DOOMS
[2:31:14] <%AbnormalVoid> mount n knot
[2:31:14] <%Meow0369> The only repatriate with dooms is sam
[2:31:24] <+MajorCrasher> @angriestpat I used a truck from the paleontologist for this because it made it way easier
[2:31:29] <+fingalights> Dooms and Repatriate are seperate
[2:31:30] <al0nem0nster> cause umbilical cord connected to beach.
[2:31:30] <CelioHogane> @Meow0369 so there is repatriates without dooms?
[2:31:30] <%Meow0369> That's why he's such a good guy for deliveries
[2:31:31] <+ekimthegib> I like how they used iceman as an example of a perfect corpse, but iceman looks like shit in reality if I remember correctly.
[2:31:34] <Gruntini> DINO DNA!
[2:31:36] <HeroToxiko> 🎶 Eastbound and down, Loaded up and truckin, we gonna do what they say can't be done 🎶
[2:31:37] <yuribo26> Bonk
[2:31:38] <mizamar> isn't it cheating using those zip lines?
[2:31:44] <Tha_Mik> no
[2:31:45] <+Nanocomputer> take those power gloves
[2:31:47] <%AbnormalVoid> hee haw
[2:31:47] <Ultimatefool> How are there 84k people here???
[2:31:49] <zenith0111> @ekimthegib It's the kind of game where they say one thing but show you another and you have to piece it together.
[2:31:51] <big_chugnus> More like Mount N u t
[2:31:52] <%J_Papa> I just took a carrier from Evo Devo
[2:31:52] <+fingalights> Zips is the game
[2:31:57] <%Meow0369> @CelioHogane Seems like it, I can't remember if it's explicitly said, but i remember it being implied that others exist, very rarely
[2:31:58] <%Soulbishop> So he still causes voidouts but comes back. . .
[2:32:03] <%xcompleasedad> You need a LOT of guns
[2:32:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Soulbishop yeah.
[2:32:07] <Nina96> @AngriestPat what u think about what heartman said?
[2:32:11] <Mister_McDerp> @ekimthegib thats the fake iceman they show you so you don't ask questions
[2:32:14] <Habblewater> @Ultimatefool 1046, not 84k
[2:32:14] <Mendin> Repatriate Voidouts are notably smaller
[2:32:18] <%xcompleasedad> @AngriestPat Stock up on nades, ladders, anchors and guns
[2:32:25] <%Soulbishop> Lol why not just take the fight to old grimjaw 24k and void out with him there
[2:32:25] <Swish19XX> I just drove past the mules
[2:32:28] <Crimpson> They talk about all this stuff that happened in America, but what happened to the rest of the world?
[2:32:30] <%Ascethetic> Im here, what did i miss?
[2:32:39] <asurite_warrior> dead mom
[2:32:44] <%FrostMass22> @crimpson Who cares?
[2:32:45] <waifoong98> just lawnchair the mules Kappa
[2:32:45] <%radda343> clean your reedus
[2:32:46] <MaeMae94> @Crimpson probably dead or dealing with it in a similar way
[2:32:46] <Mendin> You missed big plot with Heartma
[2:32:47] <%J_Papa> I didn't get into any fights, MULEs don't chase very far
[2:32:47] <kvassimoto> Pat going on a trip
[2:32:47] <vampireinarm> @Ascethetic dinasours had strands
[2:32:50] <al0nem0nster> no one knows, its impossible to travel anywhere.
[2:32:51] <Meekest> Everyone else in the world is totally fine
[2:32:55] <mizamar> what is this "rest of the world" you speak of?
[2:32:58] <RyuuAoi> @asurite_warrior "THE ORB"
[2:33:02] <tiaramaki> Oh man, those boots need replacing
[2:33:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Journey to the West.
[2:33:06] <%Meow0369> Pat you can probably do a boss fight today if you do the story
[2:33:06] <%xcompleasedad> @Ascethetic President Mom was a weird death god thingy, Heartman is still cool, you are now going to California
[2:33:15] <$realm_forge> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Hey Pat almost all the light bulbs in my apartment decided to burn out on one of the few days when none of the stores are open! Happy Thanksgiving!
[2:33:16] <HellsCherry> I'm looking at my globe and I only see MURICA
[2:33:20] <+ekimthegib> @zenith0111 Oh I get most of the game, it's literally just this one part haha
[2:33:21] <%Ascethetic> weird death god thingy?
[2:33:24] <nukle0nik> you didn't even check what the porter symbol does
[2:33:25] <%Meow0369> It costs A LOT of crystals
[2:33:26] <R3c0n31> In my favorite rocket ship
[2:33:29] <+AFrostyCookie> can somebody explain to me how sams mom was an EE and how that gave her super powers?
[2:33:30] <Maverick2736> Idon'tcare-man
[2:33:34] <%Meow0369> and you have to leave the room recycle the materials go back in
[2:33:35] <%J_Papa> @Meow0369 i think he said he plans to do the ending in one stream, it's really long
[2:33:38] <%Soulbishop> They said death stranding was world wide
[2:33:39] <nukle0nik> yeah they have effects
[2:33:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Ascethetic Extinction Entity.
[2:33:41] <Meekest> Pat
[2:33:41] <%FrostMass22> @ascethetic that's not true don't worry about it
[2:33:41] <+fingalights> What?
[2:33:41] <%deviljhojho_> big brain
[2:33:44] <%xcompleasedad> @Ascethetic "Extinction Entity"
[2:33:45] <%J_Papa> Yes accessories have effects
[2:33:47] <waifoong98> what things?
[2:33:48] <startstoprepeat> porter symbol shows porters on your map, pretty useless
[2:33:49] <%Ascethetic> OOOOOH
[2:33:49] <+코코꾸라> Yeah, every little accesory does something
[2:33:51] <waifoong98> oh those
[2:33:51] <%radda343> yes they all hav effects
[2:33:52] <%Ascethetic> interesting
[2:33:53] <Crimpson> Yeah each one has an effect
[2:33:54] <zenith0111> @ekimthegib About if animals have beaches right?
[2:33:55] <R3c0n31> @afrostycookie they will explain, via cutscene
[2:33:55] <%Meow0369> @J_Papa Not likely, it's a pretty long bloody sequence from the point of no return to the end
[2:33:55] <+Sneakman98> @angriestpat Would you kill your evil clone or would you guys team up?
[2:33:56] <+PleasantLeech> she's his adoptive mom
[2:33:56] <nukle0nik> like the weather charm helps you avoid timefall
[2:34:02] <+fingalights> I think they tell you
[2:34:08] <nukle0nik> the windmill helps Lou not be as much of a bitch
[2:34:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:34:11] <+코코꾸라> You have no shoes on?
[2:34:11] <+necrocannibal2> is Kojima saying something about Hillary? first female president and she's the God of Extinction smh
[2:34:20] <%wydamn> Man, gotta love your dead mom smiling at you whenever you finish a job.
[2:34:23] <JT137> Dio evil
[2:34:23] <Meekest> How would Paige know which one to shoot
[2:34:24] <%nofestu2> It would try to kill you
[2:34:24] <%deviljhojho_> he recycles straws
[2:34:24] <CelioHogane> is it more evil than Pat or less evil?
[2:34:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hes youyr opposite
[2:34:27] <%Meow0369> Your evil clone would also be confused and likely sit down and just play video games
[2:34:27] <cherrycottontail> Your evil clone is just you
[2:34:27] <%Rumbutt> Would Pat's clone be evil, or would Pat be the evil one?
[2:34:28] <%Deano8817> he leaves trash around the house
[2:34:28] <Daxalog> Your evil clone might get you in trouble
[2:34:28] <%Valdorick> Never team up, always asusme YOU'RE the evil clone, and kill the other one.
[2:34:29] <metabot64> Pat is the evil clone
[2:34:29] <+AFrostyCookie> @R3c0n31 thank you, thought Heartman explained and I missed it
[2:34:31] <%joylent_blue> he doesn't litter, that's how evil
[2:34:32] <%wydamn> I wouldn't trust my evil clone.
[2:34:32] <+Nomicro4u> MORE LIKES
[2:34:37] <valriot> @necrocannibal2 I mean I'm Epstein would agree with that description of Hilary
[2:34:39] <%maskofmichael> You evil clone is just you but taller
[2:34:39] <%Soulbishop> So Amelie may just be a BT if I follow the smallest nug of the story
[2:34:42] <%SvenHolgersson> So tall, full head of hair and right all the time?
[2:34:43] <%FrostMass22> Has Pat gotten to Edge Knot yet?
[2:34:44] <%Piemen99> I'll fuck me evil clone
[2:34:45] <%Meow0369> Windmill is the best endgame
[2:34:49] <startstoprepeat> i think bell is easier stealth
[2:34:53] <+necrocannibal2> @valriot true
[2:34:53] <+PleasantLeech> everyone knows if you met a clone of yourself you'd either kill it or have sex.
[2:34:54] <nukle0nik> not exactly sure
[2:34:56] <R3c0n31> They do things???
[2:34:58] <Mister_McDerp> ironic
[2:35:00] <+fingalights> Why would it
[2:35:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @necrocannibal2 Ehhh...judging from certain emails from The Elder, and the message of the game, I think Kojima is VERY anti-Trump...so I'm not sure on the Hillary part.
[2:35:02] <krabsan> Windmill is better
[2:35:04] <R3c0n31> I never knew that
[2:35:04] <$HyperionXV> either stealth or the calling for help thing
[2:35:04] <%Meow0369> Stealth is heaps easier already
[2:35:05] <Crimpson> I think they make BT's don't find you
[2:35:05] <+fingalights> It's a bell?
[2:35:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bell is easier stealth? LUL
[2:35:13] <Illiobillium> @necrocannibal2: Nope but Kojima did talk about how some of the themes in the game are connected to Trump and being a commentary on his dumb border wall policy.
[2:35:16] <ssks123> do you think you should try bringing a rocket launcher just in case
[2:35:19] <%thebiganxiety> Ghosting
[2:35:21] <%Meow0369> Where beer
[2:35:21] <valriot> Smash that bell icon
[2:35:23] <HeroToxiko> @necrocannibal2 kojima has a complicated view on women. very, complicated
[2:35:24] <Nina96> bell wards off ghost duh
[2:35:24] <ssks123> and also because its sick as hell
[2:35:25] <%xcompleasedad> @AngriestPat Did you finish the pizzas?
[2:35:25] <zenith0111> The Dollar Coin becomes god like after you get a certain weapon.
[2:35:27] <+Javaa01> Go look at the rocket launcher, see what they have to say about it
[2:35:28] <Crimpson> @AngriestPat You never did the mission to get a different drink?
[2:35:28] <%Meow0369> me want beer
[2:35:30] <%AtisutoCurry> two negatives make a positive is what im getting if pat gets an evil clone
[2:35:30] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Such a thirst for Deliveries
[2:35:31] <%thebiganxiety> Like deadass ghosting
[2:35:33] <cherrycottontail> @SvenHolgersson So Pat's evil clone is the ubermensch?
[2:35:33] <+Sneakman98> Your clone's evilness varies from day to day. At baseline he's like a take the whole cookie jar kinds evil.
[2:35:38] <+fingalights> PIzzA

[2:35:50] <Gruntini> CHAIN SAW
[2:35:52] <%nofestu2> You look like such a douch bag
[2:35:52] <%FrostMass22> The Trump wall thing is totally stupid when you take into account your connecting America and Kojima acts like it's the entire world
[2:35:55] <RyuuAoi> If you can't fuck yourself, how in the hell are you going to fuck anyone else? Can I get an amen?!
[2:35:57] <%Piemen99> wait pat got a rocket launcher?

[2:36:25] <Crimpson> @Zaphire_Saucypants I didn't know you can switch the drink out. When I did that mission, my drink was always the timefall porter drink
[2:36:26] <%AtisutoCurry> keep on keeping on!
[2:36:27] <zenith0111> @pleasantleech Just from the old German Foreigner
[2:36:27] <HeroToxiko> @PleasantLeech LUL
[2:36:27] <Nina96> u think were ever gonna see Mads again? @AngriestPat
[2:36:27] <nukle0nik> i'd just go for the non-lethal rifle
[2:36:28] <%Meow0369> @FrostMass22 In the world it's explained that we have no idea if anyone else survived or if it's only America
[2:36:28] <+ekimthegib> If I remember correctly, if you stay higher up in the mountains it's a pretty easy trip
[2:36:28] <jack_s1n> tony hawk it
[2:36:30] <Isord> ebola gun is outdated
[2:36:30] <%thebiganxiety> @ryuuaoi apatHoldon

[2:36:33] <startstoprepeat> @AngriestPat be careful skipping the mads stuff from this point on, there'll be new ones whenever you get a forced private shelter rest
[2:36:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no
[2:36:33] <%AtisutoCurry> wait how far is he now?
[2:36:38] <CelioHogane> Wait when did he got the rocket launcher, i thought he had a grenade launcher
[2:36:42] <%FrostMass22> That email from the elder is embarrassing honestly
[2:36:42] <+fingalights> They have the ammo they have
[2:36:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Near the end
[2:36:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> They are used upon being finished
[2:36:49] <%jcenderion> AMMO LIMITED
[2:36:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cannot be refilled
[2:36:53] <%Maids4lyfe> @CelioHogane he got both
[2:36:53] <nobknee> Hey, is the game good or game bad?
[2:36:55] <+PleasantLeech> I think they have 8 rounds
[2:36:55] <%Meow0369> @FrostMass22 and because the timefall fucked all communications you can pretty much only connected via the chiral network which uses magic crystals which don't degrade

[2:44:16] <critfumble_> this shit looks terrifying i hate heights god fuck this
[2:44:18] <Mendin> Hey Paige werent you going to do a makeup stream on Pat eventually or am I mixing my streamers up?
[2:44:19] <Sapphire_Breeze> they usually clip in so you have to carefully pry the metal thing
[2:44:20] <valriot> Just steal furniture from a pre school to decorate your house
[2:44:21] <+ekimthegib> that's new
[2:44:25] <%eazer__dexterous> bruh
[2:44:25] <%Ascethetic> neat
[2:44:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cooool
[2:44:28] <NeroInfinite> eroion
[2:44:29] <waifoong98> we saw that last stream
[2:44:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> never noticed that
[2:44:30] <+fingalights> You didn't see that before?
[2:44:31] <+ekimthegib> never saw that in my playthrough
[2:44:32] <%Laecerelius> Rolling STAAAAAART!
[2:44:32] <%rytyoung> I can't wait for Peach Saliva to change her name to Beach Saliva...
[2:44:35] <Bigyin396> recessed lighting is great to avoid shadows from lampshades
[2:44:36] <blaggablag> Fall rockman!
[2:44:37] <%President_Miyazaki> Think about that out of context of a video game.
[2:44:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ROLLING STONE
[2:44:41] <Illiobillium> Those falling rocks have been there literally every time you've gone up this mountain, Pat.
[2:44:41] <%President_Miyazaki> "Falling rocks, cool."

[2:44:45] <Sunstalker> Oh wait, if they're like mine, you press against the glass and turn the lightbulb out.
[2:44:48] <%Keyd00d> that rocks
[2:44:50] <Crimpson> They always fall when you go up a high mountain.. Just don't get hit by them
[2:44:54] <critfumble_> FUCK that
[2:44:54] <%Shadicara> Man I wish I could just zipline across the country
[2:45:03] <+necrocannibal2> riveting gameplay
[2:45:03] <Sunstalker> They're just a slight twist in if they're recessed.
[2:45:04] <%Keyd00d> I wish I could zipline to work
[2:45:04] <Crouton18> doesnt this contradict the whole point of the game.
[2:45:11] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[2:45:14] <Nina96> no

[3:12:21] <%Meow0369> Ignore that path to the right

[3:12:23] <Crimpson> it's always with WHALES
[3:12:25] <%Keyd00d> yes good
[3:12:26] <xiidrifty> the rule of thumb is if you're not on a building, get to a building, and especially find a string of buildings
[3:12:28] <%Meow0369> Who needs that path
[3:12:35] <JT137> is this fun?

[3:27:56] <waifoong98> LAWNCHAIR
[3:27:56] <peachy996> goodnight moon
[3:27:56] <%xcompleasedad> Rocket for BT's, Grenade for MULES
[3:27:57] <%eazer__dexterous> try them out
[3:27:58] <Zerud> rocket, but uses more blood
[3:27:58] <%rytyoung> rpg
[3:27:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> take as many of both as you need
[3:28:01] <%Soulbishop> We don't know @AngriestPat your aim has been suspect lately
[3:28:04] <%xcompleasedad> No more MULES
[3:28:08] <agumon9000> Rocket Higher DPS but Grenades are just as good.
[3:28:08] <%xcompleasedad> Go Rocket
[3:28:09] <%Soulbishop> You may want something with a delay
[3:28:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> of course the multi rocket launcher is better
[3:28:13] <%Meow0369> Oh no
[3:28:14] <%sirisvirus> the weapon you get from the next one
[3:28:14] <RyuuAoi> THINK RE
[3:28:15] <zenith0111> @angriestpat Grenades are more for BTs. Rockets are for Bosses
[3:28:20] <RyuuAoi> GO WITH LAUNCHER
[3:28:26] <xiidrifty> Multi Rocket is gonna be useful later, but Grenade Launcher might be useful for this segment
[3:28:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> rockets and grenades
[3:28:39] <%eazer__dexterous> remember that time when truck kun almost killed pat
[3:28:39] <RyuuAoi> ROCKET
[3:28:45] <%Meow0369> You want assault rifles for this part pat
[3:28:49] <%xcompleasedad> Rifles, Rockets and Ladders
[3:28:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> twas hilarious @eazer__dexterous
[3:28:58] <%J_Papa> The grenade launchers are all-purpose but we're past dealing with MULEs
[3:29:01] <%Meow0369> Maybe like 2-3 rifles
[3:29:02] <chronoxgp> you have a boot clip
[3:29:02] <+Izzzyko> rocket launcher all the way babeeeey
[3:29:11] <%rytyoung> take a hematic guj
[3:29:13] <%rytyoung> gun
[3:29:14] <%Meow0369> You need max blood in pouch
[3:29:14] <%TrickeyDickey66> at least one assault rifle with blood rounds
[3:29:14] <HeroToxiko> why would they show the america thing, in the empty outpost that only sam has been to?
[3:29:15] <sqointus> Hotdpgs horseshoes and handgrenades
[3:29:16] <agumon9000> You need Many Bloods
[3:29:20] <%TrickeyDickey66> and all the blood
[3:29:22] <%J_Papa> One blood? Blood is your ammo
[3:29:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and don't be afraid to call out into the aether when you run out
[3:29:26] <Vlesh> You need more boots
[3:29:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Whats that smell

[3:40:59] <%DatGuyJimbo> thing is with league pat needs to do a little research offscreen to learn how to play properly and I don't see him doing that
[3:41:09] <nobknee> Awesomenauts is also dead/dyin'.
[3:41:12] <%Fenrirlives> @ryuuaoi Nioh great!
[3:41:13] <+freezydude> i mean jimbo
[3:41:16] <%SashaStarshine> Yeah but its not dead yet
[3:41:17] <%Keyd00d> @RyuuAoi he went back to the mule camp without taking a new order because his marker was still on it
[3:41:20] <+freezydude> he said last stream he looked at guides for heroes of the storm
[3:41:20] <%SashaStarshine> You can still get a game
[3:41:24] <%MisterTylerrr> Finally Found Xenoverse 2 on sale
[3:41:30] <hntronium> league of trashman I can't wait to see this garbage fire
[3:41:33] <+freezydude> im sure he'd do research for league of legends
[3:41:36] <+BiggusWingless> Dude Killer Instinct is on sale for TEN BUCKS
[3:41:40] <RyuuAoi> @keyd00d Woolie WILL figure it out!
[3:41:41] <Jarvanii> pat doesn't need to do much research, just learn by playing and look things up really quick
[3:41:43] <+freezydude> especially because he asked for sources last stream
[3:41:45] <+PenmanLupine> oh, we're switching fron Death Stranding to League now?
[3:41:48] <+freezydude> yuh
[3:41:57] <%SashaStarshine> He git oiubted towards Mobafire yesterday
[3:41:57] <+BiggusWingless> 10 bucks is a STEAL for KI
[3:41:59] <CelioHogane> BIG YES
[3:42:02] <%SashaStarshine> got pointed*
[3:42:06] <RyuuAoi> @fenrirlives Thank you! Gotta give it a stab
[3:42:07] <%DatGuyJimbo> yeh but when he gets his level up and faces people do have a clue what they are going he won't be having as much fun
[3:42:08] <+freezydude> mobafires very hit or miss
[3:42:09] <+necrocannibal2> KI is fucking great
[3:42:13] <+freezydude> but atleast it goes over abilities and shit most of the time
[3:42:17] <dan_g_v> pat is just practicing for the diablo and fighting lol games
[3:42:24] <Wakerpl> I am SO excited for this stream xDDD
[3:42:25] <CelioHogane> @DatGuyJimbo that's not how it works
[3:42:30] <%oddslogic> oddslogic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! 
[3:42:36] <CelioHogane> Leveling up is irrelevant, it's about your MMR
[3:42:42] <+freezydude> yeah it isnt level based
[3:42:45] <CelioHogane> and loosing lowers it, even if you level up
[3:42:46] <+freezydude> if you just suck dick you'll be bad
[3:42:48] <%SashaStarshine> Mobafire is basically the baby guide congeregator in League
[3:42:49] <%MaddyCaddy> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[3:42:50] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> Going from death stranding to league is gonna be the gaming equivalent of whiplash
[3:42:52] <+BiggusWingless> Remember to post your stream URL in the League chat. They love that.
[3:42:53] <CelioHogane> level up is just for the ingame money
[3:42:54] <%SashaStarshine> Its fine untill you're good
[3:43:02] <+freezydude> leveling up only gives you more control
[3:43:11] <+freezydude> like over summoner spells and shit
[3:43:18] <CelioHogane> Oh yeah at lower levels
[3:43:24] <+freezydude> What i could see making him have less fun is getting flamed super hard as a jungler
[3:43:25] <CelioHogane> after level 30 leveing up is just free shit
[3:43:26] <IndoorSitup> MISSED PAT BUMBLING THROUGH LOL YESTERDAY DIS GUN B GUD
[3:43:27] <+freezydude> like thats inevitable
[3:43:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> currently dumping second bucket

[3:43:46] <%SilentEric> Real League Players just build 6 Infinity edges.
[3:43:47] <%SashaStarshine> I still can't believe that the Summoner spell that's the best option 99% of the time isn't availible until lvl12
[3:43:51] <+R4dishh> impossible
[3:43:52] <RyuuAoi> @peachsaliva have you had your daily dose of mustard?
[3:43:53] <TheWashoutXY> so chat... how come Pat picked up league all of a sudden?
[3:43:58] <+freezydude> I still cant believe flash is in the game sasha
[3:44:00] <%Keyd00d> to suffer
[3:44:02] <%SashaStarshine> Like the game is literally balanced around flash

[3:48:14] <big_chugnus> Is Pat sponsored by Riot or something?
[3:48:15] <krabsan> You gotta get all the stacks tho
[3:48:16] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat If you use Darius's W to last hit minions the cooldown gets reduced heavilly and it becomes much easier
[3:48:16] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> Prepare for condescension
[3:48:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> Passive Bleed Maxes at 5 stacks and buffs Darius to big dick energy
[3:48:19] <+Wheatabull> W - Resets your auto attacks cooldown, so Auto, W, Auto
[3:48:19] <leinadtonu> that's how the pros do
[3:48:20] <Tha_Mik> We all can stack pee
[3:48:21] <%Valdorick> You gotta watch out for your pee stacks

[3:48:49] <+Glock3bb> Just need to be nearby.
[3:48:51] <alwayspronking> 3333
[3:48:51] <DaHaLoJeDi> depends
[3:48:51] <EdictEngine> Nobody knows
[3:48:51] <+MrTAteMyBalls> you can last hit it but you don't get more gold for it
[3:48:52] <+silvery_cricket> Yes I have played for 10 years
[3:48:54] <%slipdelasan> no just nearby
[3:48:54] <%SilentEric> Use Ctrl 1 through 4 to do your emotes.
[3:48:56] <leinadtonu> what?
[3:48:59] <%goose_attack_almanac> It also refunds mana
[3:49:00] <WeedSpagon> As long as you're nearby when the tower gets destroyed
[3:49:01] <Louie_Salmon> I don't remember that mattering in league
[3:49:03] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat team gets global gold for everyone when it dies no matter what
[3:49:03] <%wtfthatoneguy> you get gold for being near them when they die
[3:49:03] <The_Hand> yes but gold is shared @AngriestPat you get credit but its shared
[3:49:04] <%valkuma> Tower hits absolutely matter you sabotage gamers
[3:49:05] <%Spiritttz> you have to be the only onearound it to get full gold but anything can last hit and you get gold
[3:49:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> yes
[3:49:07] <%Big_Dream> here is a legit tip keep a small champion pool of three mains and 1 or 2 champs for off roles once you figure out the champs you like
[3:49:07] <rytisone> no one here plays this
[3:49:07] <+Zrams3y> yes, it used to matter but changes were made to not matter as much
[3:49:07] <+silvery_cricket> You also get bonus gold if your the first person to break a tower
[3:49:08] <+OblivionSword1> yes but it doesn't really matter in LoL
[3:49:08] <TheArrow_> can you last hit the back?
[3:49:09] <%slipdelasan> But there is global gold too
[3:49:10] <%Tenkay> If you get the Tower health to the little bars on their health bar you get extra gold @AngriestPat
[3:49:12] <UnfilteredComic> You can butit doesnt matter that much
[3:49:13] <%eazer__dexterous> middle lane
[3:49:15] <CelioHogane> Last hitting the tower just makes you feel good because it shows you did it
[3:49:15] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat Don't level things up equally. You want one level in each skill but you want to level Q first.
[3:49:16] <RyuuAoi> Death Stranding is a warning for the future. Start stacking your poops, pees, and cums immediately! And bloods!
[3:49:17] <%galaxyswirl> damage buff abilities damage towers
[3:49:18] <leinadtonu> what's a tower?
[3:49:18] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat i think you also get the mana refunded from your W if you kill what you hit with it
[3:49:26] <%Takreth> Black Friday oof
[3:49:29] <Tunykun> Patt cashier PTSD

[3:50:08] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> One duck sized vampire
[3:50:09] <%maskofmichael> I meant to say zombies
[3:50:13] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> 1 < 1000
[3:50:14] <IndoorSitup> Alucard vs. Shitty thralls??

[3:50:29] <KilljoyHexx> I mean 1000 vampires cant beat Blade...
[3:50:29] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> Or a horse sized vamire
[3:50:30] <%slipdelasan> WHAT IS A VAMPIRE A MISERABLE LITTLE PILE OF BATS
[3:50:32] <%Valdorick> Law of Conservation of Ninjitsu states clearly that 1000 vamps are jobbers to 1 vamp.
[3:50:32] <hntronium> But is it the sex zombie too
[3:50:33] <%eazer__dexterous> one time stop vap
[3:50:33] <%ThatOneGameTester> locked in on cuck

[3:51:05] <+silvery_cricket> Okay Pat Darius has 2 ranges on his Q the optimal range and the wrong range. You do not want to hit people with the handle it does barely any damage.
[3:51:05] <CelioHogane> @mor3gan no, Vampires are not zombies, vampires are a type of undead.
[3:51:07] <+freezydude> fuckin' 4 melee lol

[3:53:15] <%DatGuyJimbo> he's learning
[3:53:18] <%MaddyCaddy> You didn't block the map.
[3:53:18] <$realm_forge> The sound of pat cumming in his pants every time he drinks is making my eye twitch
[3:53:20] <TheyCallMeVawn> 2 top huh
[3:53:20] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> Oh God

[3:53:21] <%Moave> @angriestpat what about after that
[3:53:22] <The_Hand> 2 top classic
[3:53:23] <%SashaStarshine> Black Cleaver for tank killing Trinity Force for turret killing
[3:53:23] <ReDexuz> great layout
[3:53:24] <+freezydude> Darius's Q has a sweetspot, if you're too close you'll do less damage and wont bleed the target
[3:53:24] <CelioHogane> Pat the chat isn't hidden
[3:53:24] <Fancypants25> I am so proud of him
[3:53:24] <DaHaLoJeDi> double top, unstoppable
[3:53:26] <TyrantBelial> Why can we seet he map
[3:53:29] <IndoorSitup> GOBLINS SLAYED
[3:53:30] <rytisone> video games have finally consumed Pat
[3:53:30] <gps309> the good ol' dual top
[3:53:32] <%wydamn> Oh no, Pat's in an Isekai
[3:53:33] <+R4dishh> he's learning
[3:53:33] <%eazer__dexterous> what is happening
[3:53:36] <+yourbuddycarl> duo top lets get it
[3:53:37] <%yeknomlive> why is pat trapped in the game
[3:53:37] <WeedSpagon> Tryndamere is typing
[3:53:41] <CelioHogane> They were
[3:53:41] <Swimmingrock> Dual top? Is this 2009?
[3:53:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> was your camera supposed to be covering the map?
[3:53:43] <Monkroot> is 2 top meta now or is it to just help Pat
[3:53:44] <$Chimeraelite> I was confused for a sec then I realized we're so low level here no one has smite
[3:53:44] <+freezydude> Some of them were pat
[3:53:48] <ReDexuz> why would you block it, i dont get it
[3:53:48] <+freezydude> they were just old screenshots of the map
[3:53:50] <+silvery_cricket> Put wards in the bush
[3:53:52] <+Masutasodo> Why would he need to block his map for low level blind pick
[3:53:53] <+pacmanswang> Pat's not at the level where they have jungling yet
[3:53:54] <%eazer__dexterous> middle lane
[3:53:55] <+AtlasMcCoy> There is 0 reason to block your map until the big high super good players
[3:53:55] <TheyCallMeVawn> In river bush
[3:53:56] <+silvery_cricket> they work better in bushes
[3:53:56] <krabsan> WARD BUSHES
[3:53:57] <+Coolkevinator> facecheck brushes I see
[3:53:58] <1matheuw> i mean if you dont care if you get ghosted
[3:53:58] <The_Hand> cring ward
[3:53:59] <gps309> next time put in the bush
[3:54:01] <+AnxiousLogan> people put a fake map on top of it that shows the jungle all dark so it looks there but fake
[3:54:02] <+patel347> they just have a screenshot of map to make it look normal
[3:54:02] <blaggablag> yeh you're supposed to ward bushes Pat
[3:54:03] <rytisone> oh yeah, Dunkey also hates League
[3:54:04] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat only a few big streamers who are known to tilt block there maps
[3:54:04] <Hegataro> @Monkroot pat's too low level for Smite
[3:54:04] <+VGGary> @ReDexuz people watch your stream to see your map and cheat
[3:54:04] <%ThatOneGameTester> they use old pictures of the map as overlays
[3:54:04] <RyuuAoi> Pat is apart of the UI
[3:54:05] <%slipdelasan> No one has smite so there are no junglers I think, I forget when you get it
[3:54:05] <+Radiantomega> that akali is gonna murder a lot of them
[3:54:05] <Kiraklene> Ward the fountain
[3:54:08] <%Spiritttz> i hope he trys the lvl 1 w cheese with ignight one day that shits hilarious
[3:54:08] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat Yellow wards are invisible for the enemy, they can't blow it up without a scouting tool
[3:54:09] <CelioHogane> @AngriestPat they use a special image that makes it look like the map is empty all the time, but it's still hidden
[3:54:11] <%slipdelasan> Like level wise
[3:54:11] <%SilentEric> Wards in bushes are better than outside of bushes.
[3:54:13] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> map hiding only matters at like challenger levels where people actuallly care enough to snipe
[3:54:13] <mor3gan> Why no getting orbs
[3:54:13] <+pacmanswang> Wards in bushes reveal fog of war areas Pat just FYI
[3:54:14] <stoccton> scary
[3:54:16] <+silvery_cricket> Read your Q it has two ranges
[3:54:21] <%SlackerAlex> The Pat Window
[3:54:21] <Monkroot> @Hegataro ah okay thanks

[3:54:55] <%AncelDeLambert> yo Twitch wtf why do you keep eating my sub message?
[3:54:56] <professorno> Why is it called "league" if you can only play as one guy at a time
[3:54:56] <IndoorSitup> CHAT GOING INTO FULL BACKSEAT MODE
[3:54:57] <Swimmingrock> So is pat teaming with people he know who are guiding him or just randoms?
[3:54:57] <The_Hand> he got last hit POG
[3:54:58] <StingtheKing> Farming is a hard-grown skill.
[3:54:58] <+Coolkevinator> wow right low level
[3:54:59] <+pacmanswang> dont fight under tower at this level
[3:55:01] <+freezydude> oh god pat noooooooooooooo
[3:55:03] <mor3gan> DUMBO
[3:55:03] <+timmc916> oof
[3:55:03] <+freezydude> dont hit them under the tower
[3:55:08] <stoccton> big hurt
[3:55:09] <redrins> because you attacked an enemy under their tower
[3:55:09] <Monkroot> too strong a push
[3:55:11] <%MaddyCaddy> Hitting heroes gets you tower aggro
[3:55:11] <TwistedVerse> oh god it hurts to watch, but i love it
[3:55:11] <FutaSnek> shhhh chat
[3:55:12] <Kiraklene> Because you attack an enemy champ LUL
[3:55:12] <+patel347> if you hit champions turret rarget you
[3:55:12] <$Chimeraelite> Hit enemy = tower aggro
[3:55:13] <+VGGary> if you hit the enemy the tower goes on you
[3:55:13] <+HyperCharge_Sam> if you attack champions underdeath turret, they attack you
[3:55:15] <WeedSpagon> Tower aggros when you deal champion damage
[3:55:15] <$CarlosEoM> if you hit the enemy champ the tower agros you
[3:55:15] <%Takreth> when you hit enemies under tower the thing activates to defend
[3:55:16] <+Schiz_Turtles> attacking dudes who are behind the tower
[3:55:17] <yojohny> How the fuck did this happen anyway?
[3:55:17] <FutaSnek> no backseat
[3:55:17] <TyrantBelial> Cus you hit the enemy
[3:55:17] <blaggablag> You're not supposed to aggro champions under tower range
[3:55:18] <Sacksquatch> attacking a champ under a tower gets tower aggro
[3:55:18] <Jarvanii> is there no tower aggro tutorial nowadays?
[3:55:19] <alwayspronking> @AngriestPat it targets you if you hit an enemy champion under it
[3:55:19] <%Binary_Fireball> oh boy
[3:55:19] <1matheuw> beware the fact that your hemorrage causes the turret to aggro you
[3:55:21] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat if you hit a champ under turret, the turret targets you
[3:55:22] <mor3gan> RUN
[3:55:22] <%Spiritttz> @AngriestPat hurting enemys under their tower will get you attacked by turret
[3:55:23] <+AnxiousLogan> wonder when pat stares at fans make an in game community/discord 🤔 or maybe there is one im unaware of
[3:55:23] <%slipdelasan> @AngriestPat Towers auto target you if you damage enemy champs under em
[3:55:23] <gps309> If you hit a player under the tower the tower targets you
[3:55:24] <17sevens> oh my god I didn't understand how awful this would be
[3:55:25] <%eazer__dexterous> wheres GUN hero
[3:55:27] <Foggysheep> @AngriestPat if you attack them near the tower, it will switch to you
[3:55:28] <Mister_McDerp> it aggros the tower if you hit them near it @AngriestPat
[3:55:29] <yojohny> At least play DOTA
[3:55:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AncelDeLambert Are you typing an essay? Word count limit is the problem usually
[3:55:29] <RyuuAoi> Spoil NOW, CHAT Kappa PJSalt PJSalt
[3:55:30] <CelioHogane> @AngriestPat if you hit an enemy at tower range the tower will instantly try to hit you, the only case where that wouldn't happen is if the tower is attacking someone else.
[3:55:33] <UnfilteredComic> Good spacing
[3:55:34] <+Coolkevinator> you hit them under the turret and it targets you
[3:55:35] <%Bailey__gaming> How are you enjoying the game?
[3:55:39] <DaHaLoJeDi> you have to bait them
[3:55:40] <+OblivionSword1> tower prioritise people that attack their allies @AngriestPat
[3:55:41] <%yeknomlive> this brings me back to my dota lan parties. so much screaming
[3:55:45] <kvassimoto> LUL
[3:55:46] <IndoorSitup> BACKSEAT BOYS
[3:55:49] <BlackermanZX> yeah its hard
[3:55:50] <%MaddyCaddy> Tryndamere is taking everything
[3:55:50] <Tunykun> pretty sure there is a tutorial for tower aggro that you're forced to do
[3:55:50] <OldManDeckardCain> just play smite then LUL
[3:55:53] <Fuji_Apples> I find last hitting in dota tougher
[3:55:56] <Wakerpl> woah close
[3:56:01] <%SilentEric> Flash would have been good
[3:56:04] <%SashaStarshine> DOTA is tougher in general
[3:56:04] <FutaSnek> CHAT IS ALLREADY TOXIC OH BOY
[3:56:04] <Wakerpl> that was pretty good
[3:56:05] <%Arathiun> its easier when your not competing for it
[3:56:05] <%Binary_Fireball> pat is gonna get ded
[3:56:06] <FutaSnek> LUL
[3:56:08] <+silvery_cricket> When your chasing press D so you can run faster and just kill people
[3:56:08] <$Chimeraelite> Gotta save that e for when they're running
[3:56:09] <+pacmanswang> he doesnt have flash at this level
[3:56:09] <+VGGary> your D is a sprint isnt it
[3:56:09] <CelioHogane> this is fun
[3:56:11] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> ward the river
[3:56:12] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat you should save your pull for when people are running away. if they're right in front of you already just fight them
[3:56:13] <Divum_muviD> dang
[3:56:13] <%gusdabus91> even if you dont last hit you still get exp, so it isnt a complete loss
[3:56:15] <%SilentEric> Don't be afraid to use mana to push lane when enemy is gone
[3:56:21] <%wydamn> We're the backseat boys and we are called that because of all the noise we make.
[3:56:21] <1matheuw> ignit coulda finished the job as well
[3:56:22] <17sevens> i'm crying

[3:56:24] <17sevens> what is this
[3:56:25] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god I just tried to scroll the screen down to watch the tower NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:56:25] <%Moave> @angriestpat any damage done to an enemy champion while in turret's range of fire will cause it to auto lock on to you.
[3:56:26] <+patel347> use w to last hit mions to get mana and cd reduced
[3:56:27] <%silvery_cricket> silvery_cricket subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:56:28] <%COMB711> remember pat, your heal heals you and big sword man, so if he's in danger you can save him

[3:56:29] <DaHaLoJeDi> lul trynd taking all the cs
[3:56:36] <%DatGuyJimbo> I'd turn off auto attack if you haven't aswell

[3:56:48] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Tryn is a lane hog so beating him in last hits is hard
[3:56:49] <big_chugnus> Fuck this game looks like absolute autistic garbage
[3:56:51] <CelioHogane> @Moave 5th
[3:56:51] <%gusdabus91> the most important creeps to last hit are the cannons, they give the most monies
[3:56:53] <IndoorSitup> Chat is going into full BACKSEAT BOYS mode.
[3:56:54] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat you can steal all the gold if you use W to last hit >:)

[3:57:45] <The_Hand> pat calls them heroes, makes me sad

[3:57:50] <Monkroot> Nautilus PogChamp
[3:57:50] <big_chugnus> Is this a game for 8 year olds?
[3:57:52] <Louie_Salmon> They're called champs, btw

[3:57:54] <$Chimeraelite> nope
[3:57:54] <%gusdabus91> nautilus is amazing
[3:57:55] <%DatGuyJimbo> nasus
[3:57:56] <redrins> gotta learn the game first, champ selection later
[3:57:56] <%Sephirios> this is the best league stream
[3:57:57] <%thesnugglelord> I'm glad Pat's using summoner spells incorrectly instead of not at all
[3:57:57] <kvassimoto> Sword and board mariaWoke
[3:57:57] <DaHaLoJeDi> the big fat chunky men
[3:57:59] <1matheuw> udyr is piss easy to play as well
[3:58:01] <CelioHogane> Wrong
[3:58:04] <%Fenrirlives> well you're doing decent footsies!
[3:58:05] <hntronium> LEAGUE OF NO HONOR
[3:58:07] <+freezydude> YEAH
[3:58:08] <%Bailey__gaming> NO HONOUR
[3:58:08] <+AtlasMcCoy> veigar has a leprechaun skin it would be perfect for you.
[3:58:08] <%Keyd00d> it's just a bland style
[3:58:10] <Jarvanii> it has no style, it has no grace
[3:58:10] <+freezydude> USE THE SWEETSPOT ON THE Q
[3:58:10] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> generic with mass appeal
[3:58:11] <%MaddyCaddy> Skins ruin the entire artsyle thing
[3:58:11] <+freezydude> YEAHAHAHAHA
[3:58:12] <blaggablag> oh no, ORIGINAL ART had no art style at all. That is to say it had but the art style was blizzard.
[3:58:14] <Fancypants25> It gets even worst with skins
[3:58:15] <%COMB711> It's fine that tryn is getting all the gold, he scales better with gold
[3:58:16] <WeedSpagon> Malphite is cool Ok.
[3:58:18] <%SilentEric> There is more unified art recently as they have cemented the lore.
[3:58:19] <Monkroot> The champs come from a lot of different backgrounds
[3:58:19] <gps309> is a mish mash of 10 years of design
[3:58:20] <Sacksquatch> I miss old Sion, and his dumb action movie quotes
[3:58:22] <%Svanyr> aw yeah double adc top
[3:58:22] <%SilentEric> Its by region.
[3:58:22] <%MaddyCaddy> So the game can't have a style so they can sell skins
[3:58:23] <%ThatOneGameTester> They had one, got tossed pretty fast
[3:58:23] <MetelStar> There is SO MUCH I can say about Jhin
[3:58:23] <redrins> the game also has some old ass champs that look super out of place now
[3:58:23] <%Mekhet09> Sion is fun.
[3:58:25] <aeonicvector> I mean, it has subthemes but generally yeah they throw style to the wind
[3:58:25] <mikesapartment> okay... what the fuck did i tune into?
[3:58:26] <dan_g_v> this game has ton of artstyle
[3:58:26] <CelioHogane> Oh no
[3:58:26] <%Svanyr> the strongest tech
[3:58:28] <Swish19XX> Every MOBA looks like Blizz style to me
[3:58:29] <%MisterTylerrr> No no art style, but certain no singular Art Direction
[3:58:33] <mor3gan> Just farm
[3:58:33] <gps309> and there is some 10 year old assets in there LUL
[3:58:34] <Hellarussian> are these bots?

[4:00:01] <+doragonkiba> i mean these games all have their roots in a game mod that was cobbled together from a mix of models from different groups with warcraft models, inconsistency is at the core

[4:00:57] <chidere> I really wanna see Pat play Udyr for some reason

[4:01:13] <%Sephirios> no one should ever play Udyr
[4:01:14] <IndoorSitup> Chat is going into full BACKSEAT BOYS mode.

[4:01:30] <%Deadbulky> What servers pat on?
[4:01:31] <mor3gan> you just havent looked
[4:01:32] <CelioHogane> @AngriestPat if you hit an enemy at tower range the tower will instantly try to hit you, the only case where that wouldn't happen is if the tower is attacking someone else.
[4:01:32] <+freezydude> You're doing great sweetie
[4:01:33] <%COMB711> Good job Pat, you're killing it
[4:01:35] <Monkroot> @AngriestPat you're doing great for a beginner just make sure to enjoy yourself!
[4:01:35] <Mister_McDerp> the key is to not look at chat
[4:01:37] <Tunykun> Cause you know way more than last time :)
[4:01:37] <+taggerung403> has he practiced vs bots?
[4:01:37] <%Kirby_Sauce> Is paige there?
[4:01:39] <Louie_Salmon> Are we supposed to.. not backseat?
[4:01:39] <chidere> But Udyr is best boy D:
[4:01:39] <Ravenian96> you press t to emote

[4:01:40] <%SilentEric> You're doing better, and Peach isn't conveying everything.
[4:01:41] <%SashaStarshine> Becaue Paige isn't screaming at Pat from across the room LMAO
[4:01:41] <RyuuAoi> You need blood grenades
[4:01:41] <Twoiis> Generally you want boots earlier just to be able to get back to your lane faster.]
[4:01:43] <+doragonkiba> i recommend enjoying yourself and having a good time
[4:01:44] <IndoorSitup> 1k
[4:01:45] <%xXRealGamerThaigeXx> at least 2
[4:01:46] <MoulesFritz> pat just let me comandder your brain and play for you
[4:01:46] <%Keyd00d> I can't backseat if I haven't played
[4:01:47] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, that's why, there's 600 fewer viewers this time than last
[4:01:50] <+CrescentRubyRose> LoL is one of those games that you kinda need the backseating for general things, the rest you learn

[4:04:06] <DaHaLoJeDi> RIP
[4:04:06] <%Mekhet09> go for ashe
[4:04:07] <Monkroot> That would have been great
[4:04:08] <The_Hand> its g plus click and drag btw
[4:04:08] <arkv01> BOIVIN RECRUITED FOR LAKERS STARTING LINEUP more at a 11
[4:04:09] <mor3gan> bot lane carrying
[4:04:11] <LoneFonte> @Caped_Eggy nope
[4:04:12] <+Coolkevinator> at least Pat knows abilities rotation
[4:04:12] <Tunykun> exposed lol
[4:04:12] <%SilentEric> She got no mana, but she slows you with every attack
[4:04:13] <azots> does Pat know how the ulty works?
[4:04:17] <critfumble_> @Takreth guess im still not playing then fuck that unfair advantage shit along with summoner spells
[4:04:24] <faldin> The c u b e
[4:04:26] <%eazer__dexterous> a happy pat is a good pat
[4:04:28] <+spookeyskeleman> kinda rough playing darius into double ranged champs
[4:04:33] <+AtlasMcCoy> BTW pat, you can also level up skills by holding control then pressing the skill button.
[4:04:33] <waterstealer> IF YOU KILL WITH IT U CAN USE IT AGAIN FOR FREE
[4:04:34] <%Spiritttz> @AngriestPat if you ever get a kill with your ult just go in harder you get a massive boost for a while after and you can re use ult
[4:04:35] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat you are way stronger for 10 seconds after killing someone with your ult and the cooldown on it gets reset, look for opportunities to get chain ults
[4:04:38] <+freezydude> If you dunk and kill the person you can dunk anotherr person
[4:04:39] <+HyperCharge_Sam> if you kill with the ult, you can use it again
[4:04:41] <%silvery_cricket> you can hover your mouse over your abilities and it will tell you what they do
[4:04:41] <dmtjinni> WHRER IS PAIGE? x
[4:04:41] <IndoorSitup> KINDA????
[4:04:43] <%ComicLord> @angriestpat you actually killed that guy correctly/optimally good job!
[4:04:44] <Haarute> ashe applies slow on every autoattack so it's tough to get close to her as melee.
[4:04:46] <TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat All you need to know is this: If you kill them, you get it back and can dunk another person. Fetch your Pentakill
[4:04:46] <big_chugnus> @AngriestPat If you smash alt-f4 this garbage game will shut down
[4:04:53] <%Takreth> @critfumble_ once you hit level 10 you get access to all the runes and summoner spells so it's pretty fair in that respect
[4:04:54] <+Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat are you having fun playing?
[4:04:56] <Louie_Salmon> And it refreshes
[4:04:57] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> careful
[4:04:57] <masheshardest> does more damage with more bleeds or they are lower health
[4:04:58] <mor3gan> stop doing that
[4:05:02] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat read his passive please
[4:05:04] <waterstealer> nice dive nerd
[4:05:04] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> GREED
[4:05:04] <WedgeFF6> if they have 5 of those blood drops around you do big damage
[4:05:06] <+freezydude> WORTH

[4:07:19] <TyrantBelial> Everytime the Black Mage hits you they gain more stat that makes their spells do more damage, he scales infinitely.

[4:07:32] <+Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat are you having fun with the game?
[4:07:32] <%Spiritttz> Veigar has a short complex
[4:07:34] <+MisterCrimson> It's been years since I tried this but does Veigar still gain stacks of damage with every kill he gets?
[4:07:36] <DaHaLoJeDi> Also Veigar's laugh plays whenever he kills you with his ult
[4:07:37] <waterstealer> lux is op
[4:07:39] <dmtjinni> ITS U
[4:07:42] <+freezydude> Yes crimson
[4:07:42] <%SilentEric> Is that a short joke?!
[4:07:42] <%Moave> does vieger's ult scale with enemy ap still?
[4:07:43] <MKII> da fuk is league doing on here. is this a sponsored stream
[4:07:43] <kvassimoto> not anymore
[4:07:48] <+VGGary> christ i dont even like league but now i want to play
[4:07:48] <hntronium> Did someone say HONOR
[4:07:51] <%ThatOneGameTester> Pat in his MODOK playing league, truly the darkest timeline.
[4:07:52] <%silvery_cricket> @MisterCrimson Yes he gains even more stacks actually
[4:07:52] <waterstealer> no, its an execute now
[4:07:52] <big_chugnus> @MKII Yeah
[4:07:53] <+freezydude> he gets AP every kill with Q and every champion kill gives him AP in general
[4:07:54] <azots> she has no escape now
[4:07:54] <+AnxiousLogan> @Moave no it's execute
[4:07:55] <%Bailey__gaming> he sounds like worf
[4:07:56] <%Sephirios> Yes Veigar is still a endlessly scaling monster
[4:07:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 (read last please) Paige: (as pinky) "where ya' goin pat?" Pat: (as brain) "back to the stream labs to prepare for tomorrow night." Paige: "why? What are we gon'ta do tomorra night?" Pat: "the same thing we do every night paige, actively try not to shit ourselves on steam!"
[4:07:59] <%SilentEric> @Moave No it's based on missing health now

[4:08:14] <BlackermanZX> Mid not looking so great
[4:08:16] <+AtlasMcCoy> Veigar's ult is an execute instead of anti-ap now
[4:08:18] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat So darius is simple but you have to understand that he needs 5 stacks of bleed to do the best amount of damage.
[4:08:19] <%eazer__dexterous> play lux
[4:08:19] <+Phalcore1141> oh NOO
[4:08:24] <arkv01> I'm surprised they haven't changed veigar much since like 9 years ago
[4:08:26] <%Gogogolem> I wish league wasn't terrible.
[4:08:26] <%Moave> @anxiouslogan that sucks. I miss his old one

[4:13:01] <aeonicvector> you did, but you upgraded
[4:13:03] <%SilentEric> They are elements of bigger items.
[4:13:03] <kahryez> you turned it into something else
[4:13:04] <%trnzero> it means you can buy it again
[4:13:04] <FeelsBadPat> some items build into others
[4:13:04] <gps309> not anymore
[4:13:05] <big_chugnus> Misguided FOMO stream
[4:13:07] <RyuuAoi> @neonbleu 2020, baby!
[4:13:07] <alwayspronking> @AngriestPat you used it to make the red item
[4:13:08] <azots> @AngriestPat there are items that become other items and you loose them
[4:13:09] <%slipdelasan> build paths
[4:13:10] <%slipdelasan> yeah
[4:13:10] <+patel347> big items have the same basic block
[4:13:10] <ReDexuz> buy magic resist for veigar
[4:13:13] <+KilogramHours> @AngriestPat Its crafting paths
[4:13:15] <DaHaLoJeDi> you got dragon power
[4:13:15] <+desfore> nooooo
[4:13:16] <+AnxiousLogan> they are components, parts used to build the full item
[4:13:16] <WedgeFF6> @AngriestPat that little gnome does more damage the more abilities he hits and scales forever
[4:13:17] <%s_xylocalsingles> YOU USED IT FOR CLEAVER
[4:13:17] <%MaddyCaddy> You used it to build something
[4:13:20] <%Spiritttz> BUY MAGIC RESIST nooo
[4:13:21] <%ThatOneGameTester> His ult/R is an execute that does magic damage increasing as you have less health iirc
[4:13:22] <%s_xylocalsingles> ITS CRAFTING PATHS
[4:13:22] <+pacmanswang> you need magic resist vs veigar
[4:13:23] <Axle13j> yea should probably get some MR lul
[4:13:25] <+VGGary> the items you have are at the bottom-mid of your screen
[4:13:26] <+freezydude> Veigar(the mage that keeps killing you) uses magic damage so the armor will do literally nothing
[4:13:26] <%bluetocho13> bluetocho13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[4:13:27] <redrins> also you dont have to stay in your lane all game

[4:13:32] <azots> MR would be good here, yes
[4:13:33] <%MaddyCaddy> so number go up
[4:13:34] <RollCritFail> Technically you can buy multiple of pretty much any item, but their unique passives don't stack
[4:13:34] <+SirBearic> things with check marks are thing you have in your inventory
[4:13:37] <%AncelDeLambert> there's two adcs in this match, armor is fine
[4:13:38] <%galaxyswirl> its not tho

[4:17:43] <+freezydude> His shame cage stuns you if you touch the walls

[4:20:59] <%SilentEric> There is a little red circle when he calls down a meteor. Don't be in that circle. But don't touch the walls of his big circle. Basically, Veiger is about avoiding circles.
[4:20:59] <ThanatosNyx2> use ult after you hit them
[4:20:59] <1matheuw> GET SNIPED
[4:21:01] <waterstealer> R AFTER HITTING THEM
[4:21:02] <Haarute> r is the finisher.
[4:21:02] <azots> Tryn got greedy
[4:21:02] <TheWashoutXY> Save R for kill
[4:21:03] <+KilogramHours> @AngriestPat Read your ultimate Pat
[4:21:03] <%Sephirios> your ulti does fuck all without bleed stacks
[4:21:04] <%Spiritttz> Ult last for dar

[4:21:05] <BlackermanZX> Damn that ashe snipe
[4:21:05] <WedgeFF6> ult after you get the bleed stacks
[4:21:05] <Mister_McDerp> USE ULT LAST
[4:21:05] <DaHaLoJeDi> Pat you gotta read man
[4:21:06] <Tunykun> Veigar probably has a 30 kda or something already
[4:21:06] <redrins> dont open with your ult with darius, save it
[4:21:07] <%DatGuyJimbo> ashe with the save
[4:21:07] <+desfore> @AngriestPat save your R to kill them. if it kills, it resets!
[4:21:08] <waterstealer> R IS FOR KILL
[4:21:09] <+patel347> @AngriestPat dont use ult unless they are bleeding
[4:21:10] <%JellyT89> You need bleed stacks to make your ult hurt
[4:21:11] <Crouton18> never ult unless you have some stacks on them
[4:21:11] <%Mekhet09> Pat you need some bleed stacks.
[4:21:12] <+SarcasticSoul> This is hilarious
[4:21:12] <Axle13j> Yeah that was a losing fight lol
[4:21:13] <Wakerpl> save the R for the end of your combo
[4:21:14] <ReDexuz> magic resist
[4:21:14] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I think I'm starting to understand why so many LoL videos have downvotes
[4:21:15] <%SashaStarshine> @AngriestPat The more the enemy is bleeding from passive the higher your ult damage is
[4:21:18] <+KilogramHours> @AngriestPat R deals more damage when the enemy is low
[4:21:18] <%CalebHatesGames> Why does everyone expect you to be a pro gamer at something you've only been playing for a few days?
[4:21:19] <+bubbli97> @AngriestPat your ult is a finisher that gets stronger the more stacks of your passive an enemy has
[4:21:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This is hard for my bloodpressure
[4:21:20] <+Coolkevinator> Not does more damage based on bleed stacks

[4:21:23] <Elvung> Elvung gifted a Tier 1 sub to netrac! 
[4:21:23] <dashwalrus> your ult makes more damage the more bleed stacks they got
[4:21:23] <waterstealer> EXECUTE THEM AFTER BLEEDING THEM
[4:21:25] <%einheri> Pat, as Darius you really only want to use your ult when you get 5 stacks of bleed on the enemies
[4:21:27] <datmouse> @CelioHogane the idea that it's too early for him to learn "buy magic resist to counter the guy that's oneshotting you" is ridiculous
[4:21:29] <krabsan> @AngriestPat use your ult to finish enemies in fights

[4:27:57] <kvassimoto> BOMBS
[4:27:57] <redrins> none of them are tanky bois or go top so its wtv
[4:27:57] <Samori79> straw poll

[4:28:07] <%SashaStarshine> >Pat Having a soul
[4:28:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Is this Pat and Paige?
[4:28:09] <%MaddyCaddy> Brand is big damage and do combo
[4:28:10] <TyrantBelial> brand is just massicve damage to anything that exists near him
[4:28:11] <Goldenwolf98> Hes sold it for less before Kappa
[4:28:12] <%eazer__dexterous> he already sold it

[4:29:32] <TheAlmightyVox2> You're just gonna want to use the two you get next level.
[4:29:33] <Twoiis> All random all mid.
[4:29:34] <Fancypants25> ARAM= ALL RANDOM ALL MID

[4:29:42] <%MaddyCaddy> It's fun
[4:29:43] <waterstealer> FUCK YOU PAT
[4:29:43] <aeonicvector> its JUST teamfights
[4:29:43] <%silvery_cricket> Aram is fun
[4:29:44] <timblenaut> All Random All Mid (one lane)
[4:29:44] <WedgeFF6> it is
[4:29:44] <Tunykun> casual random mode
[4:29:44] <supuhmagikarp> it
[4:29:45] <%Spiritttz> its the best
[4:29:45] <BlackermanZX> Its fun
[4:29:45] <Manwad> it's some bullshit indeed
[4:29:46] <%SilentEric> All random all mid.
[4:29:46] <+desfore> it's really fun
[4:29:46] <%Finaldragoon> LoL is dumb shit
[4:29:47] <krabsan> True
[4:29:48] <Haarute> ARAM is just a fight pit, it's great.
[4:29:49] <hntronium> sounds fun tbh
[4:29:51] <supuhmagikarp> is the best mode
[4:29:52] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> It is dumb and it is great
[4:29:53] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Exhaust is a single-target slow and negative damage for a bit, barrier is big shield time
[4:29:53] <Goldenwolf98> More balanced than the main gamemode LUL
[4:29:54] <elspiceweasel> basically just deathmatch mode
[4:29:54] <Fuji_Apples> aram can be fun too actually
[4:29:55] <TomCrimson> Hey Pat, play TFT Kappa
[4:29:56] <BlackermanZX> Try it
[4:29:56] <%s_xylocalsingles> Snowball is for ARAM
[4:29:57] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> Aram is just thunderdome
[4:29:57] <+MrTAteMyBalls> it's dumb as hell and exists because people were doing it all the damn time on custom maps
[4:29:58] <SilverJakler> ARAM is more fast paced than regular Summoner's Rift
[4:29:58] <Fuji_Apples> more casual and simple
[4:30:00] <%Taglog7> I'm only watching cuz of the fighting game okay
[4:30:00] <+OutOfJambread> Flash is best spell
[4:30:04] <+Mythicalbrit> @AngriestPat honestly ARAM is really good for you to get used to using ur abilities correctly
[4:30:04] <DuoScratch> omg, a bahbu account rooVV
[4:30:06] <Mister_McDerp> aram is good for learning characters you don't normally play
[4:30:06] <%DatGuyJimbo> team fight tactics GO
[4:30:09] <%MaddyCaddy> Exhaust is really good
[4:30:09] <%eazer__dexterous> death stranding looks different
[4:30:10] <TheWashoutXY> FLASH is best spell
[4:30:11] <SuiZideD> Aram is pretty trash
[4:30:12] <%Dre_> your gonna want flash and teleport @AngriestPat but you dont have them unlocked yet
[4:30:12] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat aram super fun if you know how to play every character in the game

[4:32:22] <%Mekhet09> @AngriestPat When it comes to veigar or anyone really you should look at their stats. Items should tell you how strong they are. Also, items aren't actual weapons they're just additional stats and veigar and other mages can just one shot you if they get too much.

[4:39:01] <reiju_22> hes also in the fighting game :)
[4:39:01] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat watch Aatrox during the game, you might like him
[4:39:01] <+freezydude> PLAY BLITZCRANK
[4:39:03] <Vinniesaurus> that means you have to a third game

[4:39:06] <+thechezdispenser> you know what? no, no, if Pat is brave enough to play League of Legends I am brave enough to subscribe to him for that
[4:39:06] <Haarute> armor is good this game because all enemies deal physical damage.
[4:39:07] <%MaddyCaddy> Thresh have bigger hook
[4:39:08] <redrins> how is adc easier, top is literally the easiest role
[4:39:08] <%kyh9> You're better off just playing Tank
[4:39:09] <Cristalpufy> not that easy
[4:39:10] <%DatGuyJimbo> LOL adc is not easier

[4:39:38] <Tempmael> high level play
[4:39:39] <FeelsBadPat> You REALLY do not need to at your level and the fact that you are playing casually
[4:39:39] <%wydamn> fake map to confuse stream snipers
[4:39:40] <waterstealer> so you can see
[4:39:41] <gps309> So you don't get a stream snipped
[4:39:41] <waterstealer> it
[4:39:41] <%SashaStarshine> To trick snipers
[4:39:43] <@SSaryn> Good question
[4:39:44] <+freezydude> its the map for you dingus
[4:39:44] <KellBeII> yeah to hide their junglers position
[4:39:44] <+tuchpi> league players LUL
[4:39:45] <Tempmael> stream sniping

[4:39:47] <UnfilteredComic> Its overlay
[4:39:47] <Hellarussian> shut
[4:39:48] <+freezydude> it's just on another layerr
[4:39:49] <+MrTAteMyBalls> no you put it on your overlay, you see the normal map
[4:39:50] <Louie_Salmon> To fuck with them
[4:39:50] <waterstealer> you should always be looking at the map you scrub
[4:39:51] <Skatedeandre> Yes
[4:39:51] <fatally_furious> confuse stream snipers
[4:39:51] <Manwad> no, the map is on our side only
[4:39:51] <%Alpha8087> I assume it is like blocking chat in XIV when streaming
[4:39:51] <%Spiritttz> they have sections they play in revealed
[4:39:51] <%silvery_cricket> prevent stream sniping
[4:39:52] <%SilentEric> Qiyana is Pat's favorite lady personality and also she dabs. Pat will love her.
[4:39:54] <%galaxyswirl> to mess with people
[4:39:57] <Manwad> You see the map just fine
[4:40:01] <%eazer__dexterous> steam snipes
[4:40:02] <1matheuw> so that you dont get ghosted
[4:40:04] <WedgeFF6> it's to avoid stream sniping on your screen it's normal
[4:40:05] <%RayDaug> @AngriestPat they hide the jungle, the area between lanes. You can still see what's going on in the lanes
[4:40:07] <Skatedeandre> You need it for the game
[4:40:07] <%Spiritttz> @AngriestPat the parts thay play in arent blocked
[4:40:13] <%MisterTylerrr> It can't be THAT hard to locate people on this map
[4:40:17] <Hexer_The_Hacker> @angriestpat Its to prevent stream snipers
[4:40:18] <andresisant> You could put your webcam over it

[4:40:21] <+MrTAteMyBalls> love a good porbo
[4:40:22] <+MisterCrimson> so...pornography?
[4:40:22] <%einheri> Stream snipers do not matter at all for Pat though
[4:40:24] <Wakerpl> the map is for YOU, and stream snipers don't get to see free info
[4:40:25] <%eazer__dexterous> pagie love porn
[4:40:31] <mannywatcha> Aatrox did a flip
[4:40:32] <MrMysteryMask> put a gif of the map on there and boom instant snipe troll
[4:40:36] <%SilentEric> So Pat, once you take your top tower, move to mid and start grouping.
[4:40:36] <WedgeFF6> why does he have null magic orb?
[4:40:38] <stukamod> NICE

[4:42:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Thresh is the cool
[4:42:10] <%SilentEric> Just you wait for the Fighting game and card game and ARPG to really flesh out that LORE
[4:42:13] <+freezydude> its an item thresh has

[4:42:30] <%AncelDeLambert> it's dirt noob normals, guys, let him last hit if he wants to
[4:42:34] <StingtheKing> Relic Shield consumes a stack and gives you gold if Thresh kills a minion.
[4:42:34] <+Glock3bb> Support item. Gives you money when he kills a minion.
[4:42:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE IS MAKING FUN OF YOU FOR PLAYING LEAGUE @angriestpat LUL
[4:42:41] <%SilentEric> Thresh bought a support item, so he can CS for both of you.
[4:42:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Thresh, the bone daddy beside you, has a Support item that lets him periodically execute minions granting both of you gold for it
[4:42:43] <%Valdorick> Mad lad
[4:42:45] <Hexer_The_Hacker> @angriestpat He has a support item, lets him give you CS

[4:42:58] <mannywatcha> That's why you must destroy it
[4:42:59] <%MaddyCaddy> This Thresh sucks

[4:49:27] <%masked_hero_lucky> With your spin, try to hit with the axe head
[4:49:27] <TurtleButter> nice job veigar kek
[4:49:27] <HoboCabs> oh no
[4:49:29] <%einheri> @AngriestPat ONLY ULT WHEN YOU HAVE 5 STACKS
[4:49:29] <krabsan> LUL
[4:49:31] <%goose_attack_almanac> Didn't count!
[4:49:32] <korickdapally> You should have hit him with the EDGE pat the EDGE
[4:49:34] <kvassimoto> LUL
[4:49:35] <JoeBecomesJoe> tomatoConcern
[4:49:36] <%RayDaug> you hate to see it
[4:49:39] <WhitePantherZ> this is so weird to watch
[4:49:39] <+bubbli97> are these people feeding or do they not know what the towe does?
[4:49:41] <kvassimoto> NA gank
[4:49:42] <%SilentEric> SHe is low level. You can stomp her.
[4:49:45] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> TransgenderPride trans rights!
[4:49:45] <korickdapally> HIT WITH THE EDGE OF YOUR Q ITS SO MUCH MORE DAMAGE
[4:49:48] <%thesnugglelord> TransgenderPride
[4:49:48] <RantingRavager> Question for people here, what's the general consensus on back-seat gaming?
[4:49:48] <%Dre_> @AngriestPat when your buying your tier 2 boots buy the yellow ninja tabis instead of the blue ones
[4:49:49] <supuhmagikarp> are we going to tell him w is the best damage skill?
[4:49:52] <%MaddyCaddy> It does more damage with more stacks
[4:49:52] <DaHaLoJeDi> 3 to 5 is good
[4:49:53] <+freezydude> Your Q has a sweetspot mechanic
[4:49:54] <Jontman42> Only ult when you know it'll kill Kappa
[4:49:55] <Hexer_The_Hacker> That fucking Veigar, lmfao
[4:49:56] <%Spiritttz> you can ult with less
[4:49:58] <Wakerpl> you can ult when somebody's low
[4:49:59] <%kyh9> Xayah does extra damage when she recalls her feathers
[4:49:59] <+AtlasMcCoy> more stack = bigger number
[4:49:59] <Louie_Salmon> Well, if you have some stacks it's fine
[4:50:01] <korickdapally> YES
[4:50:01] <%SilentEric> She is level three
[4:50:01] <Studyman> pat oh
[4:50:02] <%DatGuyJimbo> it really is fascinating watching this game at this skill lvl
[4:50:08] <%SilentEric> I mean, if you had mana.
[4:50:09] <%SashaStarshine> That Xayah is kinda kiting, Pat CANNOT stomp her
[4:50:09] <%einheri> @AngriestPat When you have 5 stacks your ult deals true damage, which means it ignores all resistances
[4:50:10] <mannywatcha> you can stomp her she squishy
[4:50:11] <TurtleButter> yeah, watching new players is really weird after so long
[4:50:12] <Mimiic> you can smack her and sheel die
[4:50:13] <MrMysteryMask> don't get greedy just cause he's low @AngriestPat
[4:50:13] <%ThatOneGameTester> unless it would gurantee kill at lower stacks, aim for 5 would be the best way to present the information.
[4:50:16] <%yeknomlive> trying to bait you
[4:50:21] <%SilentEric> Thresh at bottom now
[4:50:29] <mannywatcha> but maybe you couldn't take them 2v1
[4:50:29] <SilverJakler> @AngriestPat Max out your Q first, then your E, then W
[4:50:31] <%AncelDeLambert> yep, it sure is fascinating watching a child try to stand up and faceplant into the floor
[4:50:32] <%Trair> your ultimate scales based on the blood stacks, and it resets if it gets the kill. so you only want to use it when they are low and/or have 5 stakcs and ur in hype more
[4:50:33] <eaglesun> thresh 1v2ing tristana and caitlyn bot lane. what a hero
[4:50:34] <ashbirds> is being low on mana a part of the league experience or is that pat being new
[4:50:35] <%eazer__dexterous> K I L L
[4:50:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> no mana
[4:50:42] <WhitePantherZ> @DatGuyJimbo isnt it tho its so weird looking back at what we would have been like
[4:50:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> I believe in ya
[4:50:45] <RantingRavager> Remember, auto-attacks and abilitites put one stack of your passive bleed on the person, so you can, if you combo good, put 5 stacks of your passive on a person pretty fast. After which, you can ult for big damage
[4:50:48] <TurtleButter> dat shield
[4:50:51] <DaHaLoJeDi> no mana
[4:50:51] <%Dre_> @AngriestPat when your buying your tier 2 boots buy the yellow ninja tabis instead of the blue ones.
[4:50:54] <%SashaStarshine> It's pretty common when people don't back
[4:50:57] <Studyman> is he playing against bots?
[4:50:58] <krabsan> good idea to go back
[4:50:59] <Louie_Salmon> Good call
[4:50:59] <Manwad> oh no
[4:51:01] <dmtjinni> I'll come back to the stream halfway throgh this blunt @AngriestPat
[4:51:04] <Wakerpl> how did they lose 2v3
[4:51:04] <BlackermanZX> Aatrox smuf?
[4:51:10] <%thechezdispenser> That Aatrox is gonna ruin people
[4:51:11] <TurtleButter> @Dre_ whoops.
[4:51:11] <+jacintafor> pat press d for the speed boost @AngriestPat
[4:51:11] <%reneries> man, Watching LoL just makes me wish HOTS was more competitive
[4:51:13] <%masked_hero_lucky> Ah too late, I was going to say get Ninja Tabi
[4:51:16] <korickdapally> Yea these are people
[4:51:17] <ReDexuz> THERE ARE MORE BOOT OPTIONS
[4:51:22] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat because it's awkward
[4:51:23] <%SilentEric> Just cause you are new
[4:51:23] <%deviljhojho_> perhaps
[4:51:24] <RantingRavager> It's because we can't see the names, personally
[4:51:25] <+KSabot> no because they are really bad lol
[4:51:26] <Louie_Salmon> You probably should play against bots
[4:51:26] <DaHaLoJeDi> no it's because THEY suck
[4:51:26] <+bubbli97> no because everyone else is so bad
[4:51:27] <Gxmwp> Because of how bad they are, which is understandable since they're beginners
[4:51:27] <%reonome> oh baby I got a sub, thanks dude
[4:51:28] <Mister_McDerp> most people start with bots @AngriestPat
[4:51:28] <korickdapally> No, its because they are doing 2 top
[4:51:29] <+AtlasMcCoy> Its cause new players are recommended to play against bots
[4:51:29] <%Trair> Bc bot games used to be mandatory for low levels
[4:51:29] <%SlackerAlex> Bad Players look like Bots
[4:51:30] <Tempmael> low level play like bots LUL
[4:51:30] <%D33TR> its hard to picture people playing this bad
[4:51:30] <TurtleButter> it's cause they are acting like bots. and you're doing better.
[4:51:31] <%SashaStarshine> Its because your opponents are playing weird, but thats just because its low level
[4:51:34] <chad_irl> it's cause everyone sucks
[4:51:34] <+OutOfJambread> Pat is way too good for this
[4:51:36] <%masked_hero_lucky> People think you're playing bots because two people top is how you play bots, because bots don't jungle
[4:51:37] <%SilentEric> Oh yeah, because we can't see names.
[4:51:37] <mannywatcha> No its cause the other team sucks so much too and isn't abusing you
[4:51:40] <korickdapally> The proper meta is to have 1 top, 1 mid, 2 bot and one Jungler
[4:51:40] <%ThatOneGameTester> cus the people you play agains't make bad mistakes the low bots would make Kappa
[4:51:42] <MessyBristles> It’s because bots don’t jungle
[4:51:42] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah it's because they suck and don't have names
[4:51:43] <dmtjinni> GIVE PAIGE A MIC !!!!!!!!!
[4:51:44] <StarkMaximum> Because people see people who are worse than them and assume they're not fucking human
[4:51:44] <%Alpha8087> The bone
[4:51:48] <TheWashoutXY> People arent used to seeing new player gameplay like this @AngriestPat
[4:51:48] <Rushemall> that veigar

[4:51:58] <+AtlasMcCoy> He was confused
[4:51:58] <Tunykun> I think he confused which darius was his teammate
[4:51:59] <Jontman42> Veigar doesn't quite have the hold of his mouse yet
[4:51:59] <+Jaysky> Veigar must be a bot Kappa
[4:52:01] <supuhmagikarp> this vieger NotLikeThis
[4:52:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> He's new and dumb maybe?
[4:52:02] <+Thunderhawk47> i think that veigar is color blind
[4:52:03] <%eazer__dexterous> he wants you
[4:52:03] <%SilentEric> So not the same veigar.
[4:52:03] <+legend_of_nolan> I think we're just to dumb to know what the veigar is thinking
[4:52:04] <Tempmael> he cant tell the difference
[4:52:05] <jetvillain> because you guys look alike
[4:52:08] <Louie_Salmon> This is why people think you're playing with bots

[4:53:31] <+freezydude> i thought
[4:53:32] <%SashaStarshine> @Jaysky Cause he was way too good in competitive with it
[4:53:32] <RantingRavager> It's TIME FOR [C9]ANGRIEST PAT
[4:53:35] <%Spiritttz> Their attrox isnt a murf and that means theres a chance
[4:53:37] <+JakeSG> @Jaysky he has to kill someone in his ult to get a revive
[4:53:39] <FeelsBadPat> its fine

[4:54:11] <%masked_hero_lucky> In the off chance you see this, their team is really focused on auto attacks, ninja tabi would have probably been a better purchase than mercury treads.

[4:56:51] <Manwad> It is now
[4:56:55] <NJigglypuff> pat is learning, just as the other darius is learning. league is hard at first guys
[4:56:56] <Louie_Salmon> Sure, new word
[4:56:58] <mannywatcha> More like being a nooob
[4:56:59] <%ThatOneGameTester> just a baddie
[4:57:01] <+ccwettr123> @StarkMaximum that's true, though I wouldn't be surprised if some junglers were up his alley, especially someone like vi just bc trolliness
[4:57:01] <Jontman42> I'm loving this visible improvement from previous streams
[4:57:03] <1matheuw> its inting
[4:57:04] <Haarute> yeah everyone's a low level scrub here. unless smurfing.
[4:57:05] <%Big_Dream> Pat joins TSM
[4:57:09] <Iggeh0> these are literally all new players stop being assholes
[4:57:10] <+AtlasMcCoy> Lets try not to make fun of people who have played only 0-3 games of this
[4:57:12] <+OutOfJambread> It takes a lot of time to learn
[4:57:12] <Mister_McDerp> you'll get used to it
[4:57:12] <mannywatcha> It is
[4:57:13] <+nintega010> Playing my champion Darius
[4:57:13] <korickdapally> Not everyone has hundred of hours in league
[4:57:15] <1matheuw> is pat the next faker?
[4:57:15] <+legend_of_nolan> deff not easy. Its all practice
[4:57:16] <Jontman42> It'll get easier with experience
[4:57:16] <%Spiritttz> congratulations pat your progressing in terms of bad to less bad
[4:57:17] <mannywatcha> let me tell you
[4:57:18] <BlackermanZX> You'll get it eventually
[4:57:19] <supuhmagikarp> @Wakerpl i haven't played in a long time, but isn't W most damaging skill? i remeber when Q was when darius came out, but it changed to w i thought
[4:57:21] <WedgeFF6> i'm lvl 90 and i still suck at it
[4:57:25] <%SilentEric> Now you can rotate to mid.
[4:57:25] <Louie_Salmon> People playing this for years still have trouble sometimes
[4:57:25] <+freezydude> Pat often times people would make custom games and just practice lasthitting with no items to get a feel for their champions last hits
[4:57:25] <mannywatcha> i am the worst at farming
[4:57:30] <AmericanaRed> why TF he playing league
[4:57:30] <%masked_hero_lucky> Your W is an auto attack reset, so it's useful for attacking again quickly to secure last hits.
[4:57:31] <RantingRavager> Pat is the Quebequoi Sneaky
[4:57:31] <Flyrant> now go help mid pat
[4:57:34] <gamerdoodicus> what even
[4:57:35] <1matheuw> im gold 3 and still bad
[4:57:35] <%einheri> @AngriestPat Getting last hits is way easier if you just click to move around a lot instad of just standing there auto attacking
[4:57:38] <korickdapally> ULT
[4:57:39] <korickdapally> YES
[4:57:40] <+freezydude> HE WAITED
[4:57:41] <+Simketh> You can animation cancel your auto with W on Darius to get those last hits

[4:59:26] <SilverJakler> @AngriestPat Hey fun fact, in the lore Darius unkowingly sent his own son to die on the battlefields and when his baby momma try to tell them, another soldier killed her before she could. That soldier did so to keep him from being emotionally broken from that fact.

[5:01:17] <Manwad> Yes
[5:01:17] <1matheuw> yeah
[5:01:17] <StarkMaximum> Depends on the level
[5:01:17] <@SSaryn> Yes
[5:01:17] <+OutOfJambread> yes
[5:01:18] <Mister_McDerp> YES
[5:01:18] <%Spiritttz> yup

[5:01:19] <Wakerpl> Yes
[5:01:19] <TheWashoutXY> yeah
[5:01:19] <+legend_of_nolan> only in early game
[5:01:20] <+Jaysky> Sometimes? Yes.
[5:01:20] <dezik45> Pat’s jukes on point.
[5:01:20] <ristos237> yes
[5:01:20] <%galaxyswirl> YES
[5:01:21] <%ThatOneGameTester> huge
[5:01:21] <BlackermanZX> Kinda yes
[5:01:21] <%thegreenbenis> WHAT REALLY?
[5:01:21] <%TaifuDragon> depends which level
[5:01:21] <Louie_Salmon> Massive
[5:01:22] <+GeneralHysterics> rip veigar, holy crap
[5:01:22] <+azure22900> depends
[5:01:22] <krabsan> Yes
[5:01:22] <%einheri> no
[5:01:24] <Flyrant> no, but gear does
[5:01:24] <Twoiis> 5->6 is huge.
[5:01:24] <+Rooknasty1> early game yes
[5:01:24] <StarkMaximum> 11 vs 12? eh. 5 vs 6? oh god yesa
[5:01:25] <Jontman42> @AngriestPat It's the 8 kills you have that make the difference
[5:01:26] <%SilentEric> It can.
[5:01:26] <+JakeSG> early and at ult levels
[5:01:26] <+AtlasMcCoy> Sometimes
[5:01:28] <korickdapally> stay away from it for now
[5:01:28] <mannywatcha> It is a big deal
[5:01:28] <Tyrimat> Early game
[5:01:28] <%DatGuyJimbo> yeah items more so
[5:01:29] <@SSaryn> Actually nah, people saying depends are right.
[5:01:29] <%kyh9> No unless it's 5-6
[5:01:29] <+Kaiserzelcor> Not really
[5:01:31] <KellBeII> it does early in the game less so later on
[5:01:33] <@SSaryn> Depends on items and shit
[5:01:33] <supuhmagikarp> f
[5:01:33] <TurtleButter> nice ez
[5:01:34] <%thesnugglelord> @AngriestPat 1 level of stats is worth about 500 gold
[5:01:34] <+ProtoShawk> In lane yes, out of lane, not usually
[5:01:34] <Mister_McDerp> see?
[5:01:34] <+Kaiserzelcor> it's the items that matter more
[5:01:35] <korickdapally> fucking rip
[5:01:35] <BlackermanZX> It depends
[5:01:35] <+lethallunacyx> maybe
[5:01:35] <%thegreenbenis> League of legends. @AngriestPat
[5:01:35] <%Dre_> early in the game it does
[5:01:37] <RantingRavager> That shortstack is strong
[5:01:38] <%thegreenbenis> Really pat?
[5:01:39] <mannywatcha> But you can still kill trist if you hook her she is suish
[5:01:40] <+freezydude> It depends on the champion
[5:01:41] <%masked_hero_lucky> Y'all lying, one single level isn't that big of a deal, unless we're talking level 5 vs level 6
[5:01:41] <olm46> 1-2 and 5-6 most of all.
[5:01:45] <+Jaysky> 5-6 is a huge difference, and levels that buff your ultimate
[5:01:45] <mannywatcha> Run
[5:01:45] <Slim_Lipid> Just say No Bruh to MOBAs
[5:01:47] <TheWashoutXY> ruuuun
[5:01:47] <+AtlasMcCoy> FLEE
[5:01:47] <FerwhateverDota> lmao
[5:01:48] <WedgeFF6> run
[5:01:50] <%Spiritttz> FUN
[5:01:50] <+freezydude> Mage types scale better with EXP
[5:01:50] <1matheuw> tris saved him
[5:01:51] <RantingRavager> y e e t
[5:01:51] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> good call
[5:01:52] <krabsan> LUL
[5:01:52] <shockmaster3> run
[5:01:53] <Louie_Salmon> Smart
[5:01:55] <%kyh9> Team Player Pat
[5:01:55] <korickdapally> fuck that shit i'm out
[5:01:56] <BlackermanZX> Holy shit that tristana
[5:01:57] <+freezydude> ADC/Marksmen types scale with gold
[5:01:57] <Iggeh0> his instincts are good, leave them to die always
[5:01:59] <+azure22900> 1-3 big, 3-5 not so, 5-6 BIG, then anything above two levels is a little big.
[5:01:59] <1matheuw> blessed by the tristana player
[5:02:00] <StarkMaximum> Pat already knows the most important League tip and that's FUCKING RUN
[5:02:02] <Manwad> He's better at not dying than most of the peeps i see
[5:02:02] <+Jaysky> Trist is fed
[5:02:03] <mannywatcha> JOJO STRATEGY!
[5:02:05] <+GeneralHysterics> what's thresh doing in bot? Is he farming at all?
[5:02:08] <%FrogROOT> !uptime
[5:02:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 2m.
[5:02:09] <Louie_Salmon> You could have maybe fought that with a better team, but that was rough
[5:02:13] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> oh no
[5:02:14] <Studyman> look at him run
[5:02:15] <Haarute> laning is over pat.
[5:02:17] <StarkMaximum> yeah mid's weak rn
[5:02:18] <korickdapally> "I do not tolerate cowardice" Says the man who just fled
[5:02:18] <+GeneralHysterics> FIGHT OR DIE
[5:02:19] <+AtlasMcCoy> They're HERE
[5:02:19] <Flyrant> concede tbh
[5:02:20] <%eazer__dexterous> OMG
[5:02:21] <%FrogROOT> i cant believe i missed the whole thing
[5:02:21] <StarkMaximum> because that was Veigar's line
[5:02:21] <%masked_hero_lucky> OF course they are, nothing is stopiing them
[5:02:23] <NJigglypuff> depends. in bot lane, level 2 is an enormous powerspike. lanes are won or lost depending on how quickly you can level up and if the champs can capitalize well on it
[5:02:24] <supuhmagikarp> has he learned about all Item tab yet?
[5:02:24] <StarkMaximum> and he spent the entire game in your lane
[5:02:26] <+freezydude> Wait EZREAL IS BACK? IM STUPID LOL
[5:02:27] <mannywatcha> Aim for trist she squishy
[5:02:28] <cahv123> 1 Level no. Depends on items. 3 or more yes, that's a big difference if the two players are of equal skill.
[5:02:30] <TurtleButter> nice
[5:02:31] <+BIumen> oh shit he auto reset???
[5:02:32] <%SilentEric> Teamates not grouping

[5:02:50] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> wtaf is the team doing
[5:02:51] <1matheuw> get right clicked
[5:02:53] <+GeneralHysterics> That trist took like a full minute of sitting still and shooting
[5:02:53] <korickdapally> You need to charge her
[5:02:54] <%masked_hero_lucky> If you can get to the Tristana it'd be a good idea to dunk her real quick
[5:02:54] <Mister_McDerp> they bad
[5:02:55] <Haarute> Ctrl + (Ability) to level up quickly @AngriestPat
[5:02:55] <ReDexuz> focus on ranged guys

[5:13:18] <OToole42> @AngriestPat gg though, a tip for future matches, when you see yourself needing to square off against physical damage teams, try getting an item called steraks gage, or Guardian angel, it'll offer more damage/survivability than a spirit visage

[5:18:49] <Act1Part2> All I want to know is why start in 2019?
[5:18:54] <+SquigglySquids> did i miss the stream?
[5:18:58] <%BeardedLuchador> you played HOTS, you'll probably ramp up quick enough once you understand summoners

[5:20:27] <%Valdorick> Good game design for a good game, loser
[5:20:27] <StarkMaximum> The tab tells you the basics of each ability - there's a lot of mechanics under the hood that would confuse new players
