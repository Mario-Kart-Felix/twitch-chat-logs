[0:23:41] <GMDeynger> After the tutorial, you can create Multi-Weapons.
[0:23:41] <%Axellogic> You do but its expensive
[0:23:45] <Daxalog> Hunting Horn!
[0:23:45] <fIashman92> You will not get far enough to see that
[0:23:46] <@Moobot> Hey everyone, I'm glad to be playing PSO2 NGS tonight and thanks again to Sega for sponsoring me! If you like what you see, check the game out using this link! https://bit.ly/PatStaresAt
[0:23:47] <+fetrigon> PLAY A CLASS THAT'S GOOD
[0:23:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh Braver is tomorrow
[0:23:52] <%Nordguy> fighter stinks
[0:23:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> FIGHTER you'll enjoy most
[0:23:53] <Laecerelius> You can punch!
[0:23:54] <@JustinianKnight> sadly multiweapons kinda not great atm
[0:23:54] <%Jekado> Multi weapon means you can put other weapon abilities on your main weapon
[0:23:56] <$lotharrio> Sword, punch, gun...
[0:23:59] <Siconia> That's correct
[0:24:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> Braver is sick
[0:24:00] <Treasure_Vault> Look at the others?
[0:24:00] <+fetrigon> that's all I ask
[0:24:01] <dekkitout> You can pick em all
[0:24:01] <gslayer14> not gonna look at the others?
[0:24:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Gunner is also good @PatStaresAt
[0:24:06] <%42nfl19> Can you go through all the class vids?
[0:24:07] <%Arweynn> paTron
[0:24:08] <Treasure_Vault> I want to hear him say techter
[0:24:08] <%Alazull> Romantic
[0:24:08] <%depressed_skeleton> what if they were bigger tho
[0:24:08] <GilliamYaeger> PATRON 3000
[0:24:09] <%Axellogic> Theres 3 weapons each for the melee classes
[0:24:10] <Laecerelius> Yeah multiweapon is too limited right now
[0:24:10] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh, is Braver not available? You can't be literally Vergil?
[0:24:10] <%Jekado> Fisto-Roboto
[0:24:10] <Papa_Bearman> You can pick a sub-class later.
[0:24:11] <%TheYellowcouch> true form
[0:24:12] <%Vibe__Lord> oh look its Yda bot
[0:24:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt fighter STARTS with gloves, but you can switch to DOUBLE SABER
[0:24:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> PC?
[0:24:13] <Sydin18> I been falling in love with Double Saber actually
[0:24:14] <RadAtVideoGames> Multi weapon let's you combine two so you can use both attacks on the same weapon you have put
[0:24:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> Cross play
[0:24:18] <%patriotrenegade> I dont like the hat
[0:24:24] <%JoshManVGH> Noice
[0:24:26] <MyNameIsRasus> wait what is he playing on
[0:24:28] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:24:32] <%Monkeyweed21> the Vergil class is out tomorrow
[0:24:33] <Sydin18> Time for Aina
[0:24:33] <Zone_Spyker> what ship did he pick?
[0:24:34] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:24:34] <@JustinianKnight> thats a nice option tho, cuz of alts
[0:24:35] <Melchior_the_Wise> Double saber or fists or twin-daggers
[0:24:38] <DrkJP520> xbox and pc only?
[0:24:39] <gslayer14> crunchy loading screen
[0:24:41] <%Axellogic> @JohnAtDawn Braver update is about to drop actually
[0:24:43] <Papa_Bearman> I'm a Techter/Hunter.  I can get my offense and defense way up.
[0:24:49] <MyNameIsRasus> PodChamp
[0:24:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I normally would be Braver or Techter
[0:24:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so from what I gather this is an mmo...but with very cool dmc like action combat?
[0:24:56] <GMDeynger> Braver <3
[0:25:02] <ReiRyghts1> hot take but I hate the english dub
[0:25:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is this action or turn-based?
[0:25:03] <%Zeif00> First time watching the prologue ;)
[0:25:04] <Laecerelius> Can't Vergil it up today
[0:25:04] <B0reas> @RadAtVideoGames easier to just have two different ones equipped and swap between them, especially given there's a tiny number of PAs right now
[0:25:06] <Sydin18> Katana and Bows
[0:25:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> @DrkJP520 PC and Xbox in the west, PC and PS4 in JP
[0:25:06] <Papa_Bearman> The Braver class is a close-combat/ranged-combat combo.
[0:25:07] <RadAtVideoGames> Beaver!
[0:25:07] <%Monkeyweed21> it adds Vergil
[0:25:07] <+nictron90> Yeah, adding Braver and some other stuff :D
[0:25:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> "new" class called we put Braver back in when it was already in the game
[0:25:13] <NemokillerV> yeah it uses a katana and a bow
[0:25:16] <%pokefan9956> hang on what
[0:25:19] <Papa_Bearman> It's very anime.
[0:25:21] <Melchior_the_Wise> @KeiganOfAstora action, some of the best MMO combat
[0:25:22] <%depressed_skeleton> thats a flower
[0:25:22] <FrankGelos> !PSO2
[0:25:22] <ComplexZeru> yup braver katana/bow class
[0:25:22] <@Moobot> @FrankGelos Hey everyone, I'm glad to be playing PSO2 NGS tonight and thanks again to Sega for sponsoring me! If you like what you see, check the game out using this link! https://bit.ly/PatStaresAt
[0:25:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh...definitely curious
[0:25:23] <%pokefan9956> its not traditional MMO combat?
[0:25:29] <%twistedj3ster> crush her on impact
[0:25:30] <+nictron90> I'd say it's a bit closer to something like warframe than a traditional mmo
[0:25:32] <+shrapnull> !PSO2
[0:25:32] <RadAtVideoGames> Nope
[0:25:34] <Papa_Bearman> You'll get VERY familiar with those green flowers.
[0:25:35] <Laecerelius> No it's action combat
[0:25:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> sweet
[0:25:35] <%alternative_flu> oh lord you coming
[0:25:36] <%Axellogic> OH GOD HIDEOUS WAIFU CREATURES
[0:25:37] <RadAtVideoGames> Real time
[0:25:37] <Sydin18> I think the thing I love about pso2 base and this game is PERFECT PARRIES AND GUARDS BABY
[0:25:38] <%depressed_skeleton> Destroy her
[0:25:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> @pokefan995 real time combos and shit
[0:25:39] <B0reas> it's a restasigne and I have no idea what it is supposed to actually be either tbqh
[0:25:40] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Does it have controller support? I remember you complained about that for GW2 though I was able to adhoc controller use for it myself.
[0:25:42] <+thelonechris> Pat's invading the planet
[0:25:43] <TrollKing96> Aren't gunblades a thing in this game?
[0:25:46] <@SoFarFetched> !pso2
[0:25:46] <@JustinianKnight> yea Warframe isnt a bad comparison
[0:25:47] <@Moobot> @SoFarFetched Hey everyone, I'm glad to be playing PSO2 NGS tonight and thanks again to Sega for sponsoring me! If you like what you see, check the game out using this link! https://bit.ly/PatStaresAt
[0:25:48] <%Jekado> I hate Aina
[0:25:48] <%Puhff> Does the game have Bobba?
[0:25:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's sponsored by Sega is what that is
[0:25:49] <%megadblitz> so another mmo to play alongside ff14 ? fuck
[0:25:51] <%alternative_flu> a little bit
[0:25:52] <%TheYellowcouch> I'm gonna have to dig out my Xbox tomorrow aren't I
[0:25:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> by "new" class we mean, the one that the previous gen game already had
[0:25:53] <Nitronknight> Health plant
[0:25:53] <+fetrigon> @shinobiphoenix well they have to account for the open world gameplay mechanics
[0:25:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes, it always did
[0:25:56] <+zylomarkiii> Gunblades are only in base PSO2 for now.
[0:25:58] <Laecerelius> No gunblades in NGS
[0:26:00] <WakeUpThrow> !PSO2
[0:26:01] <RadAtVideoGames> Very good controller support
[0:26:02] <Zone_Spyker> game has too much booba loll
[0:26:04] <%depressed_skeleton> I hope Inferno is inside
[0:26:04] <Papa_Bearman> It's preferred to play with a controller.
[0:26:05] <%maenos2> poop something
[0:26:09] <%Broand> Worry not waifu I am fine
[0:26:10] <Laecerelius> Probably will get added with Luster class
[0:26:11] <+thorzer> !pso2
[0:26:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> @TrollKing96 Gunblades in base PSO2, not New Genesis but could be if they bring it back in an update
[0:26:12] <+shrapnull> gunblades are coming later but not in yet
[0:26:12] <%Bluwizard21> titty cups
[0:26:12] <stoatacious> booobs!
[0:26:13] <Siconia> greeted by booba
[0:26:13] <OmegaWeltall> Tan Lines Kappa
[0:26:15] <GilliamYaeger> @pokefan9956 I'd compare it to open world Monster Hunter/God Eater but with more anime
[0:26:15] <$lotharrio> Pat, no! The Canada cartoon cops will arrest you! You can't mention the W word!
[0:26:16] <RadAtVideoGames> No gunblades, YET
[0:26:19] <+ArtsyFoxo> Stream Sponsored by SEGA Oooooo
[0:26:20] <Papa_Bearman> Man, this looks way better on his PC than mine.  I need a better graphics card.
[0:26:23] <B0reas> @megadblitz there's very little to do in new genesis right now, you won't have much time diverted from ff14, but it's fun enough for what's there
[0:26:23] <Sydin18> Gunblades will be part of Luster Class, next year tho xwx

[0:27:00] <@JustinianKnight> so technically CASTs are cyborgs
[0:27:00] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Need to go-go-gadget get up in them guts?
[0:27:01] <dekkitout> At times like this I think "What would Calculon do?"
[0:27:01] <JetpackMcQuack> BRRRRRRT
[0:27:02] <B0reas> This is a 16 year old girl btw, SEGA confirmed, not trolling
[0:27:04] <Papa_Bearman> PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE BOOP

[0:27:09] <wolfen091> 90s internet modem noises
[0:27:12] <%MidnightBurst12> *DIAL-UP NOISES*
[0:27:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> @PatStaresAt they used to have a robot called "Digger" in this game, but had to change it for obvious reasons
[0:27:15] <%patriotrenegade> whats a fax machine Kappa
[0:27:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I prefer Cyborg, robot means SLAVE
[0:27:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:27:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why does her bra look like an athletic supporter
[0:27:21] <%crimsonharvest> i wanna be a guided missile

[0:27:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> Riiiiiiiiiiiiight
[0:27:27] <+thelonechris> I still view them as toaster ovens
[0:27:27] <Papa_Bearman> In PSO1, robots couldn't cast magic at all, no matter what.  They changed that in this game.
[0:27:27] <luftraumm1> wait doespat have a massive ass?
[0:27:27] <%ZephynM> His storage and memory could have errors. He could have ROBO AMNESIA
[0:27:28] <B0reas> CASTs have been androids too and some are cyborgs
[0:27:30] <%solracc25> that hat is going nuts
[0:27:30] <%Vibe__Lord> THANK GOD

[0:27:31] <+zylomarkiii> Good job, Pat.
[0:27:34] <Dr_Mooose> hide that away
[0:27:35] <+shrapnull> CAST are robots that have human souls transferred into full machine bodies so they're treated like regular humans
[0:27:36] <+ArtsyFoxo> lmaooo
[0:27:37] <%alternative_flu> excellent
[0:27:38] <%Larry_Q> Casts are the terminally ill turned into robots

[0:29:28] <%solracc25> beep boop
[0:29:29] <@JustinianKnight> yea the old base game also looks somewhat better now
[0:29:29] <rept7> Pat, tell everyone symbol art is off by default.

[0:32:54] <+zylomarkiii> You're waterproof.
[0:32:57] <Papa_Bearman> Maybe.
[0:32:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this game was made for us gays
[0:33:04] <%Axellogic> Shut up photons
[0:33:09] <%craigb31> He has the XXX tattoo. Is that Vin Diesel?
[0:33:13] <%NitronStreams> He literally made the shortest robot he could
[0:33:13] <Sydin18> Your made outta space metal, so idk
[0:33:19] <$Ziegsy> The bells on his hat look like googly eyes and I cant unsee it
[0:33:22] <%RyTYoung> uhh no
[0:33:22] <gslayer14> they use photons as their magic bullshit?
[0:33:23] <%PocketBearIllustrator> so does this version of PSO2 have a similar hub system like in the original? like, how the ships were servers?
[0:33:27] <Sydin18> You can also auto run with V
[0:33:29] <+thelonechris> I really wanted him to just plummet straight down into the ocean
[0:33:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> we just need space skeletons and we can get Paige to play
[0:33:39] <GMDeynger> @PocketBearIllustrator Nope!
[0:33:39] <%Jekado> @PocketBearIllustrator yes
[0:33:44] <+fetrigon> @thelonechris me too LUL
[0:33:47] <+Reisadan> !PSO2
[0:33:47] <B0reas> the tutorial is a bit misleading about photon glide, all you have to do is press jump three times

[0:33:49] <GMDeynger> Ships are servers, but there is not really a hub system.
[0:33:50] <%GarbageNirvana> This looks really neat and also like it would murder my laptop
[0:33:50] <Zone_Spyker> its got a hub city
[0:33:52] <Papa_Bearman> It's the exact same system as PSO2 original because they work off the same engine.
[0:33:55] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaCaco psaGoblin
[0:33:55] <kitsunexans> ships are still the servers but were just in a open world
[0:33:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> Learn to @PocketBearIllustrator completely different, servers were rough intitially but much better now, and its open world instead of hub system
[0:33:56] <%majorpeppy> naughty geif

[0:34:28] <Melchior_the_Wise> Can a robot have friends?
[0:34:29] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, PSO2 original has a hub, and you pick where you want to go from a menu.  PSO2 NGS is open-world with a central city.

[0:36:38] <gslayer14> meanwhile happy music
[0:36:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> technically they are part of Dark Falz, not a spoiler, Dark Falz is just permanently the reason for everything in Phantasy Star
[0:36:42] <tronhd> Bio metal?
[0:36:42] <+zylomarkiii> It's always Falspawn, Dark Falz, and Profound Darkness.
[0:36:43] <%BinaryFireball> man the face animations are great

[0:37:05] <%masterfire23> BOOBA
[0:37:05] <Papa_Bearman> Well, this is necessary because there's no more cutscenes in the game, really.
[0:37:09] <%Zeif00> I would like to land in his pod
[0:37:09] <neptious> DOLLS stand for STRAND
[0:37:13] <kitsunexans> how long is a year here?
[0:37:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Dark Falz is just THERE always
[0:37:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> Meteor-born = Meteorn
[0:37:16] <+Macua2> There are some lore reasons as to why it could be but we have no confirmations but that's spoilers for PSO2 classic
[0:37:17] <%RetroCop87> "man, just close your legs"
[0:37:25] <%depressed_skeleton> how does it fly then, mr smart man??

[0:38:43] <Papa_Bearman> You feed mags in PSO2 original, but not here.
[0:38:43] <%Jekado> mags isn't a thing

[0:38:51] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @gustavozxd oh, I played based PSO2. I'm aware.
[0:38:51] <%solracc25> Chao
[0:38:52] <Sydin18> MAGS HAVE BRAINS IN THEM BTW
[0:38:52] <RadAtVideoGames> BUT MAYBE IN A FEW MONTHS THEY CAN BE KNUCKLES

[0:38:57] <%depressed_skeleton> Red bull Oil
[0:38:58] <%Zeif00> You can feed a giant mag that buffs everybody tho
[0:39:00] <kitsunexans> you can get rid of your mag tomorrow
[0:39:00] <rept7> No feeding mags
[0:39:02] <%Jekado> you feed "an area"
[0:39:03] <Papa_Bearman> My mag is a Dreamcast.
[0:39:03] <+fetrigon> my bad
[0:39:07] <%Monkeyweed21> mag feeding was the worst part of PSO2
[0:39:07] <Truxton_II> You need electrolytes from your enemies!
[0:39:09] <neptious> Red bull fueled robot
[0:39:12] <Afterman_> hot sexy robot gets oiled
[0:39:13] <%solracc25> require WD-40
[0:39:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> tutorial time
[0:39:17] <%TheWinged7> no no pat, it needs to be inserted into your oil port
[0:39:18] <chiinachan> will you play tommrow
[0:39:21] <%MrUnKnownAlien> got i wish i was a robot too lol
[0:39:23] <Papa_Bearman> I still play PSO2 original, on top of NGS.
[0:39:26] <TheOgreKing> 5W20 please
[0:39:29] <B0reas> @Truxton_II dead on! bullseye!
[0:39:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can cancel into your other moves
[0:39:38] <%TheYellowcouch> AAAAAAAANIME
[0:39:45] <Papa_Bearman> There's actually an upgrade for some classes that makes you fall even SLOWER.
[0:39:49] <%Axellogic> ora ora goes up
[0:39:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this game has FULL combo
[0:39:52] <%MrUnKnownAlien> that looks like an exploit
[0:39:53] <%Broand> I think... there's a  move you'll quite like for that class
[0:39:55] <%solracc25> Movement seems great
[0:39:59] <GMDeynger> PP - Photon Power
[0:40:00] <gslayer14> PP very small
[0:40:00] <neptious> ORA ORAA
[0:40:02] <Papa_Bearman> Pat's PP is completely gone.
[0:40:05] <%Jekado> Normal attacks give PP
[0:40:05] <garbageheaphound> pp go down
[0:40:06] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> @PatStaresAt you can edit the placement of your floating weapons
[0:40:07] <Afterman_> yoo pat also picked punch class. robot and punch class was my pso2 choice also lol
[0:40:11] <+shrapnull> with Fighter, you get a bonus move by waiting for the animation to finish but can skip it by attacking again
[0:40:14] <$LegendGHT> small PP
[0:40:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> @PatStaresAt regular attacks build PP, abilities or Photon Arts use PP
[0:40:23] <Omega_acceptile> A machine powered by PP
[0:40:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you have another 3 moves under the "Hold LT" nutton
[0:40:28] <gunstars20> SPEEEN
[0:40:30] <%BinaryFireball> like a robot
[0:40:31] <Psyramics> speeeeen
[0:40:33] <%depressed_skeleton> speeeeeeeeen
[0:40:33] <Afterman_> tight robo radius Kreygasm
[0:40:34] <Laecerelius> PP doesn't regen when you're dashing or gliding
[0:40:38] <%UvBenServed> Majestic
[0:40:38] <fIashman92> Your PP is low
[0:40:42] <gslayer14> control VERY HIGH
[0:40:44] <BYAKURENLOVER763> thats a hunter weapon
[0:40:44] <dekkitout> Gib stick!
[0:40:46] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, hold LT and you have three different moves in your hotbar.
[0:40:47] <LatisRox> !PSO2
[0:40:47] <@Moobot> @LatisRox Hey everyone, I'm glad to be playing PSO2 NGS tonight and thanks again to Sega for sponsoring me! If you like what you see, check the game out using this link! https://bit.ly/PatStaresAt
[0:40:47] <+Ghufufin> need big PP
[0:40:48] <%Axellogic> YEs you can have spear but its a hunter weapon
[0:40:48] <Sydin18> Btw: If you complete any of the episodes in base pso2 story, you get a free scratch pick for outfits, hair and emotes from the entire pso2 story
[0:40:48] <%king_wragles> Looks like a Hunter weapon
[0:40:50] <%CollinsOfBodom> radius so fuckin tight girl
[0:40:53] <kitsunexans> fighters dont get spears
[0:40:54] <neptious> *doesnt face you to speak*
[0:40:56] <%PocketBearIllustrator> BTW, how's outfit customization? I know that in base, your armour is usually a one piece?
[0:40:59] <%blistexthief> Your radius is so tight gurl
[0:40:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> come on down to PatStaresAt, we got the tightest radii
[0:41:00] <Saltmeisterr> YO PAT COOL ROBOT
[0:41:01] <Laecerelius> You can just sub Hunter to be able to use a spear or sword
[0:41:02] <%justcallmebobplease> What a smol chonk of a Meteorn Pat is.
[0:41:04] <%octavian_wolf> octavian_wolf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[0:41:06] <chiinachan> @king_wragles its a partizan
[0:41:11] <Papa_Bearman> I never use the lock-on, personally.
[0:41:15] <%Zeif00> SourPls
[0:41:19] <B0reas> hunter uses polearm but you can swap your class to whatever
[0:41:20] <jerobees> Oh my god. "Meteorn" like meteor and born
[0:41:22] <rept7> Subclass Hunter and you'll get to use that spear
[0:41:36] <%Jekado> @PocketBearIllustrator its generally decent there are way more girl clothing then anything else.  but you can make a cool looking robot.
[0:41:36] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, Techter's my main class and Hunter's my sub-class.
[0:41:37] <%GarbageNirvana> So I seem to remember something about things you do in this giving you stuff in the original and vice versa
[0:41:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PocketBearIllustrator there's a ton of customization but some specific "selections" are one piece
[0:41:42] <+thelonechris> =)
[0:41:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> @jerobees you must've read the Script
[0:41:46] <@Mechz71> @PatStaresAt why are you not big sword man. Who are you adn what have you done with the real Pat
[0:41:47] <%depressed_skeleton> they are clearly genius people
[0:41:47] <rept7> Subclass so you can keep fighter stuff
[0:41:47] <gustavozxd> they are doing the exact opposite
[0:41:48] <%TheWinged7> people are already whispering at pat
[0:41:49] <$LegendGHT> is this a monster hunter?
[0:41:49] <Sydin18> And here is the first whisper
[0:41:50] <%king_wragles> @chiinachan that tells me nothing
[0:41:50] <%Monkeyweed21> are they?
[0:41:50] <+mikesapartment> =)
[0:41:51] <%BinaryFireball> perfect place to get my squats in
[0:41:53] <+jyeowa> =)
[0:41:55] <fIashman92> Turn off whispers
[0:41:56] <ZaCrimsonDragon> you are Meteor Born man
[0:41:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PocketBearIllustrator like "outfits"
[0:41:58] <Afterman_> turn down for what
[0:41:59] <%solracc25> SQUATS
[0:42:02] <mustachegolem> are there no other robots in this world?
[0:42:08] <%solracc25> FF7 SQUATS
[0:42:09] <Saltmeisterr> SQUATS
[0:42:10] <%depressed_skeleton> well he can't be a robot with cool thighs, Pat.
[0:42:10] <%TheWinged7> its the ff7 squat guy
[0:42:13] <%depressed_skeleton> Hes gotta work for it
[0:42:13] <Papa_Bearman> Guys...who is Pat talking to?
[0:42:14] <Melchior_the_Wise> I think he needs to be level 5 to subclass tho
[0:42:17] <%BinaryFireball> squats man did not break eye contact
[0:42:18] <Sydin18> The man is just feeling Cheeki Breeki
[0:42:18] <%doctordinkus> the ds game for phantasy star was one of my favorites, this seems to have a handful of parallels
[0:42:18] <+valheart35> oh no the whispers will begin popping up
[0:42:18] <%Jekado> @mustachegolem just not in this town
[0:42:18] <gustavozxd> squats staring at you breaking his neck LUL
[0:42:21] <%king_wragles> I'm assuming Hunter just means melee with a few gun thigns
[0:42:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I haven't played much yet, but can you use tech of OTHER classes now because you couldn't in PSO2Base
[0:42:33] <+zylomarkiii> Cancel your PAs.
[0:42:34] <%blistexthief> Save Princess Beach, robo man
[0:42:38] <+xerioes> you can always find the ff7 squat guy in an mmo
[0:42:41] <+zylomarkiii> Or link them
[0:42:48] <+BearWith6Rs> so this being sponsored? how much trash are you allowed to say about the game?
[0:42:50] <Truxton_II> Fighter PAs have two stages, you can cancel in the middle of them
[0:42:56] <Sydin18> The Knuckle's Weapon camo is super cheap on the base pso2 market board right now
[0:43:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> one thing I badly wanted to do was be a Braver with Techter techs
[0:43:05] <Truxton_II> There's a Skill Tree Skill that lets you skip to the second half of the PA if you stand still while using it
[0:43:12] <$KnivesEve> oh yeah cant you turn off whisper notices?
[0:43:13] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @shinobiphoenix @jekado if I'm able to create my scantily clad bara dad, that's all that matters to me. :P
[0:43:14] <Afterman_> does this game have decent content yet or nah?
[0:43:19] <Afterman_> i remember hearing that was an issue
[0:43:20] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, there are no PP recovery items - all you can do is either wait or use normal attacks to recover it.
[0:43:23] <%king_wragles> "is this sponsored" with the GIGANTIC SPONSORED icon right above Pat LUL
[0:43:37] <fIashman92> LT+Y/RB also does new stuff
[0:43:37] <usoto215> lmao
[0:43:39] <%TheWinged7> SQUATS
[0:43:40] <%depressed_skeleton> Lower the logo
[0:43:41] <%BinaryFireball> GET SQUATS
[0:43:41] <%Gorshum> LUL
[0:43:41] <+fetrigon> nah Kappa
[0:43:43] <OmegaWeltall> no not sponsored Kappa
[0:43:43] <B0reas> LUL
[0:43:44] <%depressed_skeleton> cover up the webcam!
[0:43:44] <%Jekado> @PocketBearIllustrator yeah its fairly possible most of the game is cosmetics.
[0:43:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> @PatStaresAt skill tree to skip foward in combos
[0:43:49] <@SoFarFetched> we all know chat can't read Kappa
