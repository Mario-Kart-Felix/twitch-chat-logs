[0:20:20] <%Valdorick> I'm a little sad the Stand didn't have on your hat.
[0:20:22] <+trainflip> granson of the mournful blade sounds like a dark souls boss
[0:20:31] <Flickerember> Jojo is threatening to be pushed too far
[0:20:31] <jackythefrost> SUCC
[0:20:33] <%weissguard> Watashi no Sutando, Silent Knight
[0:20:35] <shiny_prinny> crazy talk is a stand with no weakness
[0:20:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fighting Goooold
[0:21:31] <%weissguard> *insert monologue in Italian here*
[0:21:34] <BunnyEmperor> its pretty smart of them
[0:21:48] <jackythefrost> Final Trial is really tough on Healers
[0:21:52] <%Divryne> PAT ADJUST.
[0:21:56] <%sshen> Did Pat see that fatalis' roar was found in the icebornes beta datafiles?
[0:22:00] <jackythefrost> Then again so was Shinryu
[0:22:07] <%ElenaManetta> if pat wasnt awake before he is now
[0:22:58] <haisho> ugh is this what it feels like to be a mob in a dungeon?
[0:23:06] <haisho> feels like it's taking forever
[0:23:46] <%ElenaManetta> i like that it takes forever, i like big bosses whose HP you have to slowly drain
[0:23:50] <Thalchampz> FLASH NEVER DIES
[0:23:57] <kanodin> he is a tank
[0:23:59] <+Double_Tap_That> PLD vs DRK. How fitting.
[0:24:06] <haisho> ADJUST
[0:24:18] <$boxboten> convinced my friend to pick up the game and now they cant even make a character on my data center gggggggggg
[0:24:24] <%Divryne> ADJUST PAT.
[0:24:27] <+notgac> This fight's so much cooler than the healer one
[0:24:29] <%Divryne> You NERD.
[0:24:33] <jackythefrost> Uh oh
[0:24:34] <%theturtlebar> I like bosses with slowly draining HP, but it needs more mechanics than this
[0:24:38] <snakesonabane> just your average DRK health bar
[0:24:40] <jackythefrost> Pats HP is real low
[0:24:44] <%korth367> boy how embarrassing it'd be if he failed this
[0:24:53] <%theturtlebar> the DPS role quest one is better since it changes things up a lot half way through
[0:25:09] <%ElenaManetta> HP BIG UP
[0:25:10] <moogleboy1984> Fun Fact: Dikaiosyne is Greek for "Righteous in the eyes of God"
[0:25:16] <jackythefrost> Pat show everyone how much of a pro gaymer you are
[0:25:34] <Flickerember> The power of red bull and that hat
[0:25:50] <Sol_Install> snipe!
[0:25:51] <Flickerember> get fooked
[0:25:51] <snakesonabane> tapped
[0:25:51] <Thalchampz> LUL
[0:25:51] <haisho> His face. Unmended.
[0:26:01] <jackythefrost> Killed by Unmend of all things
[0:26:09] <%Divryne> His optimism. Gone.
[0:26:15] <%Lithdoran> RIP Knight of Darkness
[0:26:46] <gairey8464> The level of confusion I have over this being my first experience with this game is incredible
[0:27:00] <jackythefrost> I really wonder what happens in that final role quest after you completed all the other quest lines
[0:27:21] <%Lithdoran> They probably all tell you 'ARIGATOU GOZAIMASU'
[0:27:30] <snakesonabane> Sephiroth: I will never be a meme
[0:27:36] <%korth367> why do u wear the hat
[0:27:39] <%ElenaManetta> yeah pat love that chick a lot damn
[0:27:42] <Flickerember> Kokoro goes doki doki
[0:27:56] <%abakkus> oh sick free hats
[0:27:58] <%Roundelay11> Terminal bad case
[0:28:08] <%ElenaManetta> pat should EMPATHIZE with characters deeply in love
[0:28:09] <haisho> and then SUDDENLY SUSANO
[0:28:10] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat likes hats. Especially on girls.
[0:28:18] <%ElenaManetta> he should be like "i get it bro"
[0:28:25] <%Typhaeon> No one cared who Patron was until he put on the hat
[0:28:28] <+Punisher7771> pat why the dumb hat
[0:28:35] <kc703> hole in shirt near belly button. Alert!
[0:28:38] <%ElenaManetta> after all, pat would totally trap himself in a memory if it meant a memory of ELMO
[0:28:42] <jackythefrost> Patron isnt his character, it's his hat
[0:28:43] <Flickerember> Why hat getting so much play suddenly
[0:28:47] <snakesonabane> If I took the hat off, would Pat die?
[0:28:50] <$NitronStreams> I like the hat
[0:28:52] <%Lithdoran> Pat doesn't ask you why your FFXIV character looks like a troll withdowns
[0:28:53] <+Punisher7771> what scottish?
[0:28:54] <%MegboyManuel> the hat is absolutely memorable yah
[0:28:55] <%Roundelay11> Where did you even get that dumb hat?
[0:28:58] <%korth367> yeah uniquely dumb
[0:28:59] <%sshen> Why did pat not kill the hunt mob right next to him for NUTS
[0:28:59] <%ElenaManetta> yeah your head is sticking out of it
[0:28:59] <%Lithdoran> Why ask him about his hat?
[0:29:00] <+Shacklebox> grab the belly
[0:29:01] <%Valdorick> The hat looks nice in some colors, don't believe the hat-ers
[0:29:05] <kc703> belly grab
[0:29:07] <alrobot2014> the hat does add a lot to every scene its in
[0:29:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Technically, your shirt has 4 holes.
[0:29:14] <haisho> Pat didn't get his nuts.
[0:29:15] <Flickerember> Do the truffle shuffle
[0:29:27] <+CookieCutter007> !uptime
[0:29:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 29m 29s.
[0:29:36] <vaan_ratsbane> dog man extreme
[0:29:50] <+messentry> are they just big smurfs?
[0:29:54] <+Punisher7771> wait is this pat telling us of his scottish haratage
[0:29:54] <jackythefrost> Hat-Earthers: People who believe the Earth is actually one giant hat floating in space
[0:30:00] <LegendCobra> has he met Wyd Lad yet
[0:30:01] <moogleboy1984> You... did it
[0:30:07] <+Punisher7771> that would explain his shortness
[0:30:13] <%Lithdoran> But Pat is French-Canadiens
[0:30:19] <delicious_mystery> Is Pat pushing the Tiny Hat Agenda again?
[0:30:20] <vaan_ratsbane> yes, he showcased wyd lad last stream
[0:30:21] <alrobot2014> he has met wyd lad
[0:30:21] <Flickerember> @angriestpat Am I the only one who cant take Clan Nutsy seriously cause of Kung Pow and THATS A LOTTA NUTS guy?
[0:30:39] <haisho> but seriously it'd suck if those treasures were the First-equivalent to the 3 Great Kojin Treasures
[0:30:42] <jackythefrost> Gotta give him his sack-o-nuts
[0:30:42] <gekizenbu> you forgot Vaughry blowing his NUT
[0:30:49] <%SlowLikeThunder> Personally I can't clan nutsy seriously because they're called 'Clan Nutsy'
[0:30:51] <kanodin> they're called clan nutsy they're not supposed to be serious
[0:30:56] <+Karasseram> Nutsy is the moogle that leads it
[0:30:57] <TuxedoNash> they're all nutjobs in that clan
[0:30:58] <LegendCobra> pretty sure nobody can take that seriously
[0:31:00] <sovayell> hi chat KonCha
[0:31:03] <%Roundelay11> I love that damn psycho moogle
[0:31:04] <delicious_mystery> I'm one of those psychos like clemps that loves FFTA more than FFT so it doesnt bother me
[0:31:07] <%sirisvirus> I mean it's also but sacks
[0:31:10] <vaan_ratsbane> the S rank weekly unlock cutscene is the best
[0:31:11] <kanodin> at 80 you meet their leader and he's a bigger weirdo
[0:31:19] <+lucaflow> isn't Nutsy the default name of the clan from Tactics Advance?
[0:31:19] <LegendCobra> i barely have any cool doggos
[0:31:21] <jackythefrost> I'll give you a nutjob Kappa
[0:31:24] <moogleboy1984> I can't take Clan Nutsy seriously because they are from FFTA KappaPride
[0:31:33] <delicious_mystery> i repot u
[0:31:41] <Flickerember> I hope someone says that's a lotta nuts since ff14 loves their references
[0:31:42] <+Punisher7771> the firt game i ever backed came out
[0:32:02] <kc703> Thanks for the full vod uploads Pat.
[0:32:03] <TioXyco> Wait.... Clan Nutsy? You mean Montblanc is the clan Leader? Like in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Montblanc?
[0:32:05] <LegendCobra> oh he's already 80
[0:32:05] <%Drarrk> Watching Pat stare at this instead of staring at the world queue for 20 more minutes
[0:32:10] <jackythefrost> Getting from 70 to 80 is actually much easier than all the other benchmarks
[0:32:34] <delicious_mystery> At least Pat didn't get the 3 hour Wall of Ranj'it in Ahm Areng
[0:32:34] <moogleboy1984> Montblanc is in Stormblood, but he's a puffball Moogle instead of a Rabanstrian Moogle
[0:32:34] <+floodtalon> How far in is Pat, just joined
[0:32:46] <snakesonabane> Granson will return in PotD
[0:32:50] <jackythefrost> @floodtalon He's in the final area already
[0:32:51] <BunnyEmperor> Pat is at the end
[0:33:02] <Bluewolf544> THE TITLE GODDAMIT
[0:33:03] <BaskerTheHound> we cant read
[0:33:04] <TioXyco> what is title?
[0:33:05] <+notgac> yeah, but how far into finale?
[0:33:05] <+Karasseram> cause they quit school to play games
[0:33:08] <%korth367> hat too distracting for title read
[0:33:12] <vaan_ratsbane> reading is hard, seeming how many people don't read the skill tooltips in this game
[0:33:17] <Sol_Install> yep
[0:33:17] <jackythefrost> Reading is for losers @AngriestPat
[0:33:18] <SargentToughie> I read it :(
[0:33:20] <+floodtalon> Finale could be a lot of places, it could be 79, could be 80
[0:33:24] <Sol_Install> I read it tho
[0:33:27] <kc703> it was just him dude
[0:33:27] <%Divryne> Inb4 Pat doesn’t finish 5.0 today.
[0:33:28] <delicious_mystery> better than mr happy wearing the god damn dat boi/peppe head in cutscenes
[0:33:31] <$NitronStreams> We really were to Shikkoku no Villains all along
[0:33:34] <+floodtalon> I dunno where your finale is bro
[0:33:35] <Bluewolf544> @AngriestPat You assume more than half the chat can read
[0:33:37] <$NitronStreams> the*
[0:33:41] <Flickerember> Now what DRK clan armor gon be like
[0:33:46] <Flickerember> er class
[0:33:48] <sovayell> this first week of launch is always the best cause I get paired with people who dont mind taking shit slow and enjoying the dungeons/bosses
[0:33:49] <haisho> I have Twitch in Theatre Mode and the stream title don't show up unless I mouse over stream
[0:33:56] <snakesonabane> 🦀
[0:34:00] <jackythefrost> Tempest has the best OST in the game
[0:34:04] <jackythefrost> bar none
[0:34:06] <ShichiNoBushi> Crab battle!!
[0:34:11] <delicious_mystery> dont forget your culinarian mats from those succulent Dagons
[0:34:14] <snakesonabane> :crab: stormblood is forgotten forever :crab:
[0:34:20] <+floodtalon> Ooh, I joined at the perfect time
[0:34:23] <haisho> @jackythefrost but but post-MSQ dungeon
[0:34:24] <%Valdorick> Crab broke my Soul Edge.
[0:34:30] <Flickerember> in your favorite rocket ship
[0:34:41] <moogleboy1984> Have you seen the FATE names in The Tempest?
[0:35:03] <snakesonabane> that's the npc
[0:35:09] <sovayell> @jackythefrost I dunno why but it reminds me of something from persona
[0:35:21] <sovayell> its easily my favourite
[0:35:24] <%ArcanumMBD> It's just more pun fate names
[0:35:26] <%korth367> @AngriestPat under you in a cave
[0:35:27] <moogleboy1984> Ondo of Blood, Protozoan of the Enders, Where has the Dagon
[0:35:28] <delicious_mystery> It was madness to build it anywhere else
[0:35:29] <haisho> under?
[0:35:29] <jackythefrost> This song is the best
[0:35:31] <Thalchampz> oh fuck spanish guitar map music, my weakness
[0:35:34] <+Masutasodo> There's a bunch you can only get later in a cave
[0:35:36] <%PinkSuprende> Progress the MSQ you're missing half the zone
[0:35:36] <%Lapinelis> Underground
[0:35:37] <%Roundelay11> It's under you
[0:35:38] <BunnyEmperor> its below you
[0:35:39] <kc703> cool music
[0:35:40] <%EmiinV> allo friends
[0:35:44] <snakesonabane> just go through the msq and you'll get all of them
[0:35:47] <%EmiinV> rangel2Clamp
[0:35:47] <%Lapinelis> Nah, you'll get there doing the msq
[0:35:50] <Bluewolf544> Did you see that Barrioth got confirmed for Iceborne
[0:36:01] <%ArcanumMBD> the currents in this zone are very much intended for msq
[0:36:02] <sovayell> @Bluewolf544 PogChamp
[0:36:03] <%Roundelay11> You go through the cave during an msq quest
[0:36:13] <haisho> but when's mah boi Zinogre
[0:36:17] <%ElenaManetta> it's 2019 and video game maps still don't give proper indication for the z-axis
[0:36:19] <delicious_mystery> WHERES BRACHY AND GIGGY MIGGY GOD DAMN IT i have a need for slime and edgelord gears
[0:36:27] <Bluewolf544> Cant wait to see his HD icebreath
[0:36:28] <%ElenaManetta> thats the real crime
[0:36:43] <@JustinianKnight> the map does do that Elena
[0:36:43] <jackythefrost> Half of the currents here can only be gotten after a certain point in the MSQ
[0:36:47] <Bluewolf544> Zinogre is 100% in if the Flagship theory is true
[0:36:49] <ShichiNoBushi> Is Pat running on an ocean floor?
[0:36:50] <@JustinianKnight> its in the corner
[0:36:53] <%ElenaManetta> where!
[0:36:55] <+meatgeneral69> finished msq, its cool as hell
[0:36:59] <%ElenaManetta> i can't SQUINT THAT HARD
[0:37:03] <@JustinianKnight> also quest markers now haw arrows for z axis
[0:37:09] <sovayell> this expansion manage to do the impossible and beat out heavensward in terms of overall story quality
[0:37:09] <delicious_mystery> i'll be more surprised if Dinovaldo/Glavenus is actually happening over Gammoth
[0:37:10] <@JustinianKnight> have*
[0:37:11] <%Lapinelis> I love how melancholic this sounds
[0:37:15] <%Lapinelis> all things considered
[0:37:27] <Bluewolf544> Will this music ever stop being good
[0:37:31] <%Lithdoran> but pat, they're in your crotch
[0:37:32] <%Valdorick> Ones to battle, or Giant Enemies?
[0:37:33] <%ElenaManetta> oh my goodness there it is
[0:37:34] <delicious_mystery> its bubbly bernie show some respect!
[0:37:35] <%Roundelay11> Ok, I didn't know that the leveling roulette could put you in a trial. Weird AF
[0:37:36] <%korth367> you ever got pinched by a crab yo?
[0:37:36] <snakesonabane> this one crab could solo zenos
[0:37:37] <haisho> but they can beat Ifrit to death
[0:37:39] <moogleboy1984> Don't believe Ondo's lies, Patron
[0:37:40] <jackythefrost> This track is so damn good
[0:37:41] <Boxbunnytheliar> Oh dang, I've been keeping off most social media to finish Shadowbringers and I missed your reaction to revelations of 69 trial
[0:37:41] <+TheImmortal70> They're literally people sized and have claws that can snap metal in half
[0:37:41] <%Fatmanjoggin> Yeah but they could kill Ifrit
[0:37:43] <%Lapinelis> Dude, they're lvl 79, they could conquer Eorzea in an afternoon
[0:37:46] <+Gruntini> bitch boi fish dudes
[0:37:46] <TsundereFFXIV> Pat these crabs are the size of Roes THATS MASSIVE
[0:37:50] <BunnyEmperor> STANCE TIME
[0:37:58] <+TheImmortal70> SUMMON HIM
[0:37:59] <@JustinianKnight> it's just the compass that doesn't really give an exact location
[0:38:05] <sovayell> STANDO
[0:38:10] <Bluewolf544> STAND POWA
[0:38:11] <+RoByte2> The fish dudes aren't used to running on their legs. Thanks to SOMEBODY messing up their home
[0:38:11] <%Valdorick> Stando Battle
[0:38:22] <%ArcanumMBD> it's not a stand it's a persona Kappa
[0:38:23] <%Yadogari> So cool
[0:38:27] <jackythefrost> DRK's basically get double DPS during that
[0:38:30] <+Karasseram> fanciest dot in the game
[0:38:31] <snakesonabane> wow your off tank sucks pls kick him
[0:38:32] <%korth367> does he auto attack too?
[0:38:58] <+Karasseram> no he just does a set of ticks for 400 potency
[0:39:03] <+Karasseram> its a dot
[0:39:06] <BunnyEmperor> So basically his bloodspillers hit harder?
[0:39:14] <sovayell> it benefits from raid wide skills like battle litancy?
[0:39:15] <jackythefrost> Yep
[0:39:18] <+Double_Tap_That> It's Doppelganger
[0:39:19] <Everdarke> This song is so good Kreygasm
[0:39:22] <Bluewolf544> I saw your chocobo and leapt past it, That is the power of Knight crimson
[0:39:30] <moogleboy1984> There are 2 locked behind critical progression pathing, as a heads up
[0:39:33] <delicious_mystery> So its a Digimon is what you are saying
[0:39:36] <sovayell> noice
[0:39:37] <BunnyEmperor> LUL thats broken
[0:39:39] <%Yadogari> AST giving balance to your stand instead of you LUL
[0:39:49] <%Lithdoran> I don't think it's targetable
[0:39:54] <+TheImmortal70> Does it have to be out for that to happen or does it have whatever you have at the time of summoning? @AngriestPat
[0:39:56] <%Yadogari> If only
[0:39:58] <+Gruntini> How does this play with a controller compared to keyboard and mouse?
[0:40:10] <snakesonabane> i like it better on controller
[0:40:12] <+Raidou24> Is that the same for MCH's Automaton Queen?
[0:40:24] <TioXyco> @Gruntini plays amazing. you should try
[0:40:24] <sovayell> the level 80 skill and the better blackest night almost makes up for the super nerf to salted earth
[0:40:30] <%Roundelay11> Can it switch targets?
[0:40:37] <+TheImmortal70> YEs
[0:40:37] <%Valdorick> So what you're saying is - Dancers should partner it Kappa
[0:40:43] <+TheImmortal70> Well, kinda
[0:40:51] <+TheImmortal70> It attacks a target then swaps when they die
[0:40:57] <+Gruntini> Using a controller seems like it'd be way more comfortable if you're playing for extended periods
[0:40:58] <%Lapinelis> Can you dance partner? the stand?
[0:41:06] <BunnyEmperor> And SAM gets a skill he can only use after stacking meditation smh
[0:41:13] <%ElenaManetta> does FF14 have a referral system? where new players join and they can say OH this username CONVINCED ME TO GET THE GAME and the user gets like, in-game money
[0:41:14] <JetpackMcQuack> @AngriestPat New to MMO's, can I start as a healer?
[0:41:19] <%SlowLikeThunder> wait didn't they change all the actual pets to not be targetable or buffable? That's super weird that Cloneman works like that
[0:41:22] <jackythefrost> XIV was made specifically with controller in mind, this is 100% an MMO made for consoles
[0:41:26] <snakesonabane> SAM's lvl 80 is so lame, does the animation even change with stacks
[0:41:27] <%Lithdoran> @ElenaManetta Yes
[0:41:29] <%Yadogari> @ElenaManetta Yes, they give you a code
[0:41:31] <sovayell> @ElenaManetta yes, theres a mount that you can only get from referral
[0:41:32] <+CountNebula> @Lapinelis I'm pretty sure that's the plot to Ghost...
[0:41:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> craaaab people craaaab people
[0:41:52] <BunnyEmperor> No, the animation remains the same, SAM's is the most useless lvl 80 skill
[0:41:56] <%Valdorick> Why does FIsh have boobs?
[0:42:24] <sovayell> I really love that aetherite crystal
[0:42:33] <+Karasseram> you assume sahagin arent mammals?
[0:42:53] <BunnyEmperor> Shoha dmg should have scaled off Kenki imo and have nothing to do with Meditation
[0:42:54] <artoflec> what's this track called guys? i like it elaWOW
[0:42:55] <%Valdorick> I 100% assume their genus.
[0:43:03] <%Lithdoran> See, what I don't get is BLM's new skills, Despair and Umbral Soul
[0:43:09] <sovayell> those arent boobs, its where they store their fat guts
[0:43:12] <%Lithdoran> I don't see where they fit into the rotation
[0:43:14] <%Roundelay11> It's a fucking grind
[0:43:16] <Bluewolf544> Angel Is You
[0:43:19] <+SlumberMan> That post-ARR shit is the worst. Like actually 80% filler
[0:43:21] <%Lapinelis> Don't forget the magic words that'll get you a new mount in the area ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
[0:43:27] <%Lapinelis> Just repeat it several times
[0:43:33] <%weissguard> THUNDER HORSE
[0:43:33] <BunnyEmperor> In the meantime SMN gets boosted through the roof
[0:43:34] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> SIDEQUESTS
[0:43:40] <mayorrev> look at that stupid car
[0:43:50] <snakesonabane> sidequests are great now for leveling alt jobs
[0:43:59] <%ElenaManetta> Thats cool though
[0:44:02] <%ElenaManetta> Show the fucking turtle
[0:44:03] <+VidulaSaix> You mean badass right?
[0:44:04] <moogleboy1984> sick 720 bruh
[0:44:04] <mayorrev> 360 spins
[0:44:04] <Bluewolf544> Is that elmo
[0:44:06] <%Lapinelis> Dude I had to get like 30 mil exp to 80 when I got here
[0:44:06] <snakesonabane> SO HERE I AM
[0:44:07] <%Roundelay11> One of them gives a necklace, and one an aether current. The rest are worthless.
[0:44:08] <jackythefrost> TONY HAWK
[0:44:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Ballerina doge
[0:44:09] <+PenmanLupine> thats a cool horse though
[0:44:15] <Sol_Install> But the car is just as cool
[0:44:16] <sovayell> Hey Pat, did you see the video of the guy overlaying tony hawk proskater sounds while he grinds in the car?
[0:44:22] <alrobot2014> when are they gonna add an actual skateboard?
[0:44:45] <Bluewolf544> He couldnt even finish the sentence with bard in it without yawning
[0:44:48] <%Lithdoran> @alrobot2014 If they do, it'll be the only mount I ever use
[0:45:21] <kc703> fish milk
[0:45:25] <+floodtalon> Good luck pat
[0:45:26] <Bluewolf544> Smart is you
[0:45:28] <BunnyEmperor> wat
[0:45:38] <%Roundelay11> Paige is busy thinking of skeletons
[0:45:39] <Vampyro241> LUL
[0:45:42] <+floodtalon> You're gonna need it for this quest
[0:45:47] <StarMechV> But if Baba is Smart who's Baba?
[0:45:53] <FactzGameplay> Wait pat plays on pc but uses a controller?
[0:45:58] <alrobot2014> yes
[0:46:00] <jackythefrost> Yea
[0:46:05] <%Lithdoran> Yes, he prefers the controller
[0:46:09] <snakesonabane> a woman with a skeleton fetish sounds like a great concept for a horror movie featuring the horrible murder of her boyfriend
[0:46:09] <kc703> problem?
[0:46:15] <%Lithdoran> Because of his weak babby wrists
[0:46:24] <Bluewolf544> ^
[0:46:26] <SataruYamate> what datacenter is pat on
[0:46:27] <jackythefrost> @FactzGameplay This game was 100% made with controller in mind
[0:46:35] <FactzGameplay> Lol i have nothing against it just didnt expect it
[0:46:37] <%Lithdoran> Aether, I think
[0:46:39] <vaan_ratsbane> and he didnt have a gamer cube™ when he started out
[0:46:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> Wassup chat
[0:46:57] <%Valdorick> Wait, but what's Paige's view on Robots that skin humans to ware their flesh, creating at once Flesh Robots, but also a new born skeleton?
[0:46:58] <+valkuma> la HEE
[0:47:04] <snakesonabane> lali-ho
[0:47:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Are these guys sahaguns or some other fish race?
[0:47:45] <kc703> mammals

[0:47:55] <reonome> eggs PogChamp
[0:47:59] <jackythefrost> Pat is actually a terminator. He came from the future to give us quality entertainment in order to distract us from the robot uprising
[0:48:03] <bashful_bard> They're sahagin ye
[0:48:07] <%Maids4lyfe> good job Pat
[0:48:07] <snakesonabane> they're a cool new fish race named asset-re'use
[0:48:12] <sovayell> good job warrior of dorkness
[0:48:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Do you think their breeding habits are female laying a bunch of eggs and the males jizzing all over them?
[0:48:35] <alrobot2014> pat are you still sopping with light?
[0:48:35] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[0:48:35] <%TG_Cid11> Pat committed Genocide
[0:48:36] <vaan_ratsbane> yes
[0:48:36] <%Toast_Master_General> Yeah death to the gross fish people
[0:48:39] <+Dogbert24> i just finished the story the finale is pretty dope
[0:49:04] <%sshen> I love getting groups that struggle with construct 7 because MATH HARD
[0:49:05] <%Lapinelis> They're pretty nice to you, all things considered
[0:49:05] <+Queen_Kimi> Is no one gonna talk about the fish titties?
[0:49:08] <%Roundelay11> Not a whole bunch of beast tribes this expansion.
[0:49:16] <Heldritch1> yea kust finished as well, really cool
[0:49:20] <%ArcanumMBD> How is fish babby formed?
[0:49:22] <%Lapinelis> I would probably try to punch the lot who basically fucked all of my home up
[0:49:23] <Heldritch1> just*
[0:49:30] <jackythefrost> There are no beast tribe quests in ShB yet
[0:49:33] <%PinkSuprende> You better find the fricken shoebill my man

[0:50:26] <sovayell> I like to imagine the WoD doesnt have a binoculars, just zooms his eyes out
[0:50:30] <BunnyEmperor> theres a shoebill underwater here
[0:50:30] <+Lost_Zombie> Just finished up the story and god damn that was satisfying
[0:50:49] <%Tenebrae94> last thing i was here for you beat innocence what happened since then?
[0:50:51] <%Maids4lyfe> I can't wait to see Pat's reaction to the finale
[0:50:55] <jackythefrost> I can't wait to see Pat play the final dungeon that shit was insane
[0:50:58] <vaan_ratsbane> Patron's a weak ass bitch
[0:51:33] <snakesonabane> that means the bricks are tougher than the scales of an immortal god dragon from space
[0:51:52] <%Maids4lyfe> @Tenebrae94 they hitched a ride on Bismarck and made a big air dome in the bottom of the ocean to hunt down Emet Selch
[0:51:53] <%Roundelay11> Pat needs a red bull
[0:51:57] <Flickerember> lore bores patron
[0:52:01] <StarMechV> more like ASScians, am I right? hehehehe
[0:52:02] <Flickerember> patron needs blood
[0:52:10] <snakesonabane> Ancient Ascians: A History Channel program
[0:52:16] <Flickerember> need more thicc ascians
[0:52:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Is she smol? Or is Patron tol?
[0:52:18] <kc703> ass lol
[0:52:19] <FactzGameplay> Pat if you could add any feature from ANY other mmo into FF14 wat would it be?
[0:52:26] <%Maids4lyfe> Patron is tol
[0:52:38] <%Lapinelis> Pat is the smolest of the tols
[0:52:48] <sovayell> what a pretty sunset Kappa
[0:53:09] <%Lapinelis> Have fun with this one :p
[0:53:22] <%Roundelay11> 21.9, 11
[0:53:26] <snakesonabane> an rpg quest with no glowing quest marker? wtf is this shit?
[0:53:28] <%Typhaeon> The music here reminds me of the credits music of some of the old Joy of Painting episodes
[0:53:32] <%Typhaeon> It's that guitar sound
[0:53:35] <Graxe_> "You will have no help on this, so find it yourself"
[0:53:36] <jackythefrost> I got this in 30 seconds it's not hard
[0:53:43] <%Maids4lyfe> random ass flying car LUL
[0:53:46] <%TaifuDragon> Less north
[0:53:48] <%crowsloft77> it's actually by the aether
[0:53:55] <%Diabetic> Damn I've been trying to complete my character creator since Monday and I still can't make any characters on the server I want
[0:54:17] <bestwaifuritsu> You picked one of the worst possible times to do it lol
[0:54:24] <%Diabetic> Seriously
[0:54:27] <snakesonabane> it's a proven fact that potato characters are given priority for the server queue, so go for that
[0:54:29] <%Maids4lyfe> give it a few more days, the servers are at max capacity
[0:54:33] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat when your job is done and the water rushes back in won't the sheer shock force of it kill all the fish people
[0:54:43] <%PinkSuprende> She said northwest and that was a blatant lie
[0:54:47] <silvcrest> Good
[0:54:51] <jackythefrost> No fish people are strong
[0:54:55] <%TaifuDragon> What she meant was west and ever-so-slightly west
[0:54:57] <%Maids4lyfe> it's magic water
[0:54:59] <FactzGameplay> Ive actually been thinking of getting into ff14 but im lazy and dont wanna level
[0:55:04] <%Diabetic> I just want to make my actual cat person and not the bishie froo froo cat man
[0:55:06] <%Mev852_> I still need to work through stormblood.
[0:55:40] <Flickerember> so SMRT
[0:55:42] <kc703> Pat is so smart
[0:55:47] <ArcadeDomination> big brain
[0:55:50] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:55:53] <kanodin> it's gonna be so hard to find when there aren't people constantly standing there in a cutscene
[0:55:55] <%Honaoko> @AngriestPat are you planning to do post msq 80 dungeons on stream?one of them will probably answer the question you will still have after msq.
[0:55:57] <sovayell> universe brain
[0:55:58] <vaan_ratsbane> Pat's intelligence number is SO BIG
[0:56:00] <jackythefrost> Pat has the smoothest brain of them all
[0:56:09] <+sixcubit> hey chat can y'all DM me about how close pat is to the next boss
[0:56:33] <ArcadeDomination> @vaan_ratsbane I read that in Plague's voice
[0:56:58] <vaan_ratsbane> Plague would constantly complain but play a hrothgar, not a furry btw
[0:57:27] <+Karasseram> you calling paige plauge? XD
[0:57:43] <jackythefrost> Hey man there is nothing wrong with likeing that aged up pic of Weeny from Scooby Doo Ghoul School Plauge made
[0:57:45] <ArcadeDomination> both dabble
[0:57:45] <snakesonabane> plague would fly over to japan and personally threaten yoshi p into making female hrothgars
[0:58:11] <%Roundelay11> Yeah, I thought when I got here it was going to be another Azys lla
[0:58:11] <gekizenbu> what is a clutchmother to a clutch god
[0:58:14] <sovayell> shes too BLOATED with EGGS
[0:58:15] <vaan_ratsbane> they're modelling her fish titties for 5.1
[0:58:15] <%Maids4lyfe> mi'qote are just female hrothgars Kappa
[0:58:28] <snakesonabane> even the male mi'qote
[0:58:33] <Graxe_> "I would like to learn more about human childbirth"
[0:58:39] <Graxe_> This quest, basically
[0:58:50] <%Maids4lyfe> yes, especially the male mi`quote
[0:58:50] <vaan_ratsbane> I've read that manga
[0:58:50] <aaranaf> @AngriestPat Have you done any tradeskill? is it good to do as a new player?
[0:58:56] <%korth367> feed that fish mom mcdonalds
[0:58:56] <alrobot2014> i read that one too
[0:59:13] <jackythefrost> How do make baby Patron?
[0:59:14] <ShichiNoBushi> At first I thought Pat was walking around underwater because of the terrain features and the color of the "sky". But if there was no water, the plants shouldn't be wafting around like that and should be flat and limp on the ground.
[0:59:33] <TuxedoNash> the clutchmother is staying out of sight because the finless visitor might have worms
[0:59:40] <+Gruntini> Where's the Undyne NPC?
[0:59:52] <kanodin> the plants are magic
[1:00:01] <snakesonabane> thanks i hate it
[1:00:03] <%Diabetic> This area REEKS of Plague, where's Eli?
[1:00:06] <+Gruntini> Oof
[1:00:21] <ArcadeDomination> Pat's undyne birth fanfic
[1:00:23] <%Valdorick> Not enough Clownfish to be Plague's land
[1:00:36] <cascadepersona> So many quests
[1:00:46] <jackythefrost> Shits about to get crazy soon
[1:00:54] <snakesonabane> tags: monster girl, pregnant, childbirth, handholding
[1:01:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Strangely attractive for a fish-man.
[1:01:28] <jackythefrost> no fucking the fish people
[1:01:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> Off-brand Gerolt Kappa
[1:01:38] <docstrangelove> AF gear time
[1:01:45] <jackythefrost> Time for AF gear
[1:01:51] <%Roundelay11> Don't forget, he'll give you your class armor and weapon when you finish this quest
[1:01:52] <ShichiNoBushi> Can I at least ejaculate on their roe?
[1:01:54] <%Typhaeon> Gerolt of Oceania
[1:01:56] <ArcadeDomination> how do ya reckon we got fish-people in the first place?
[1:01:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> Role quests done yeah?
[1:01:59] <+BloodyBurney> oh this theme, so good
[1:02:20] <%Valdorick> @snakesonabane ha******ing!? How scandalous.
[1:02:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> Aether? I BARELY EVEN KNOW HER!
[1:02:34] <Flickerember> this ocean theme. feels like underwater/near ocean areas always sound like this
[1:02:36] <%Typhaeon> Happy little anemones
[1:02:38] <ShichiNoBushi> "I will pleasure myself with this fish." How it got started.
[1:02:38] <vaan_ratsbane> eureka theme gave me ptsd
[1:02:41] <Flickerember> not bad just seems common is all
[1:02:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'll be here all day, folks, stop the applause
[1:02:49] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[1:02:54] <Graxe_> Look at those flowing locks
[1:02:56] <Flickerember> Gerolt Alter jas haor
[1:03:04] <+VidulaSaix> Now he just needs to get abused by Rowena LUL
[1:03:06] <Graxe_> Unlike ol' Gerolt
[1:03:07] <+Dogbert24> hes gonna make your relic and at the end he'll lose all his hair somehow
[1:03:09] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> does this mean the First version of Pat also has a full head of hair
[1:03:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> KISS HIM
[1:03:23] <Flickerember> Yes
[1:03:26] <%Typhaeon> What a glorious mane
[1:03:28] <sovayell> what even is that emote
[1:03:31] <Flickerember> Pat from first has hair
[1:03:36] <Flickerember> confirmed
[1:03:38] <%Diabetic> This expansion is really good and all but shout outs to the music in this, it's incredible
[1:03:41] <sovayell> it has come.. TO THIS
[1:03:41] <+Kelpus> Have we... met before? LUL
[1:03:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Do Iknow you?"
[1:03:50] <+Dogbert24> PTSD face
[1:03:55] <quigley_plays> Does first shard pat have Fabio hair?
[1:04:09] <+HelloImTom08> yes
[1:04:14] <+Kelpus> The "Oldt" family are like Andre from the souls series LUL
[1:04:15] <+Karasseram> quigley_plays obviously he has a six pack too
[1:04:16] <kc703> what a idiot not even a fish
[1:04:19] <Boxbunnytheliar> I love the implication that Rowena is so adamant on debt collection he went to the bottom of the ocean to escape
[1:04:27] <%Valdorick> No, first Pat is still bald, he's just taller.
[1:04:34] <SailingSaturn> Quick get him ALE cirREE
[1:04:41] <%ArcanumMBD> why is it a big deal that he has hair
[1:04:50] <+Karasseram> Boxbunnytheliar this isnt gerolt lol its grenoldt
[1:04:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Stiff hair.
[1:05:00] <snakesonabane> he wants drugs
[1:05:02] <%Diabetic> Give him a Rusty Venture
[1:05:04] <+Dogbert24> totally different
[1:05:09] <SailingSaturn> @ArcanumMBD because he's a copy of the one in the Source who's bald and a drunk cirISee
[1:05:13] <vaan_ratsbane> I honestly don't understand how people compare this unique character to gerolt
[1:05:15] <%Dynamoheart> You gotta crossdress to give him that spark of inspy
[1:05:20] <%TG_Cid11> @AngriestPat make sure you talk to him again before you leave
[1:05:32] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> if you didnt do your role quest thats where it stops you
[1:05:33] <bashful_bard> Grenolt LUL
[1:05:43] <+Kelpus> Here's the funny thing. This is a level 79 quest. You NEED to be level 80 to finish it LUL
[1:05:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> Make's sure that people have their bloody gear before endgame
[1:05:56] <+Masutasodo> At least it's the last level 79 quest
[1:06:05] <snakesonabane> just level your alt to 79 so you don't waste exp Kappa
[1:06:14] <BunnyEmperor> Grenolt of Roovia
[1:06:15] <$shadow1man9> Shoutout to you losing 840k exp because they cockblock you from actually completing the quest until you finish the role action questline
[1:06:18] <kanodin> I got a theory this quest is level 79 so if you ignored role quests you can still get all the exp from them
[1:06:18] <+Kelpus> They wanted to gate you so hard, to make sure you DONT miss the artifact armour... and peopel still mis it LUL
[1:06:26] <+Dogbert24> lyse outta nowhere
[1:06:34] <%korth367> ?
[1:06:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> Here we go PogChamp

[1:07:17] <%MegboyManuel> dont forget to pick up your class gear from him dude
[1:07:19] <%demegodz> yep
[1:07:19] <SailingSaturn> Queue is full in Goblin cirD , what kind of hell is this cirBaka
[1:07:28] <%Lithdoran> So a non-serious criticism of the game is enough to get a time-out, eh?

[1:13:33] <StarMechV> ;_____;
[1:13:40] <eldragon_1> Ghost blood
[1:13:41] <snakesonabane> Remember when the archer chick shot Alisae and poisoned her badly, she was a good friend
[1:13:46] <%Lithdoran> I literally said it as soon as they said 'oh they're ascian buildings'
[1:13:51] <CrypticMochi> Light tampon to the end

[1:16:56] <StarMechV> well the beast tribes aren't making primals here
[1:17:01] <%Lithdoran> Well, the First beast tribes haven't been backstabbed a bunch
[1:17:03] <%Fatmanjoggin> This guy sounds like the vendor from darksiders
[1:17:09] <vaan_ratsbane> the eminent end of the world tends to bring people together
[1:17:10] <sovayell> hows he talking without lips, this game man
[1:17:10] <StarMechV> really the people of the source both man a d beast are just big dumb dumbs
[1:17:14] <%MegboyManuel> yeah the primals are just sorta chilling as we found out
[1:17:38] <%Divryne> Pat you read for some SHIT?
[1:17:38] <+Dogbert24> i wonder how theyre gonna do tribequests cuz just doing kobolds and sahagin again would be dumb
[1:17:58] <jackythefrost> Friendly fishpeople
[1:18:04] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> nu mou are absolutely a beast tribe
[1:18:05] <%Divryne> Y’all ready for some SHIT?!
[1:18:06] <Everdarke> They're probably doing pixies and numou
[1:18:13] <$Yakobro> dwarves?
[1:18:14] <%MegboyManuel> Hey do Lalafells just not exist in this world?
[1:18:15] <moogleboy1984> Nu'Mou
[1:18:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> Fae Dwarves and Nu mou
[1:18:16] <quigley_plays> Nu mou, Dwarves and these fish fucks
[1:18:21] <Flickerember> lalas are dwarfs
[1:18:22] <gekizenbu> the Dwarves are the Lalafell
[1:18:24] <%sshen> BEAVERS
[1:18:26] <+Kelpus> Fae will be the new moogles LUL calling it
[1:18:26] <+HelloImTom08> and maybe the Nu Mu
[1:18:27] <sovayell> @MegboyManuel they're the dwarves
[1:18:31] <baronvonkame> tbh Amaro best tribe or FUCKING RIOT
[1:18:32] <Tootall6537> Lala beast tribe
[1:18:32] <+Dogbert24> they just wear beards now
[1:18:33] <Flickerember> they drink all day so not considered real people
[1:18:38] <+RoByte2> Lali-ho!
[1:18:39] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> theres no other real reason theyd have an aetheryte at the numou camp when theres another one so close
[1:18:40] <Flickerember> like how they should be
[1:18:41] <%MegboyManuel> Oh they just have beards here
[1:18:41] <Everdarke> Pat knows the truth
[1:18:45] <%Roundelay11> fuckin' potato beasts
[1:18:47] <%Lithdoran> Think fantasy talkien dwarves
[1:18:50] <gekizenbu> feral potato
[1:18:50] <+Dogbert24> you get dwarf lore when you do healer role quest
[1:18:51] <%Lithdoran> Tolkien*
[1:18:51] <moogleboy1984> "Lali-Ho!" "What the fuck did you call me!?"
[1:18:53] <CrypticMochi> Lala are the lali-ho dwarves
[1:18:57] <%Lithdoran> That's lalafel in the First
[1:18:57] <Everdarke> "beards" more like hats with fur
[1:18:59] <+Double_Tap_That> Lalas confirmed not civilized
[1:19:00] <Flickerember> Dunno why females wear beards tho
[1:19:01] <%MegboyManuel> So they're hairy potatoes here
[1:19:01] <sovayell> this track tho Kreygasm
[1:19:02] <+Double_Tap_That> Nor living
[1:19:11] <sovayell> thank you pat for turning off the battle theme for this zone
[1:19:11] <jackythefrost> @AngriestPat theres a few aethercurrents on this path so keep an eye out
[1:19:17] <%shadybarman> They are grown and harvested just like potatos
[1:19:18] <Thenuclearwalrus> God it feels so good to summon Fray
[1:19:22] <%Fatmanjoggin> Filthy grubby potatos living in the dirt
[1:19:32] <Flickerember> They sensed weakness
[1:19:41] <+Dogbert24> he works like chocobo i assume
[1:19:42] <BunnyEmperor> I love how he kneels before he disappears
[1:19:43] <Thenuclearwalrus> @AngriestPat He can AOE too
[1:19:44] <%Lapinelis> What are the requirements for summoning the stand?
[1:19:52] <sovayell> level 80 drk
[1:19:54] <%Lapinelis> A gauge has to fill up, or just wait like a minute?
[1:19:54] <Flickerember> I wish pat would drop off cliff to 1 hp and a slime killed hin on stream
[1:20:04] <sovayell> oh, its just on a timer
[1:20:06] <%sshen> The healer quests give BIG lore on the dwarfs/lalas
[1:20:07] <+Zaver88> You can mount in here Pat
[1:20:08] <kanodin> the blood gauge in the lower right needs to be at 50
[1:20:08] <+TheImmortal70> Gauge with a 120 sec timer
[1:20:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> All Downhill from here
[1:20:14] <Flickerember> Mount who tho
[1:20:17] <%weissguard> ~To the Bottom of the Sea!
[1:20:18] <+TheImmortal70> Because if you could summon two frays it'd be broken
[1:20:21] <%sshen> AETHER CURRENT
[1:20:21] <@DariusFTL> Ondo man, take me by the hand
[1:20:25] <+TheImmortal70> And if you could summon them constantly it'd be broken
[1:20:26] <jackythefrost> HA
[1:20:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nautilus
[1:20:43] <ArcadeDomination> run up and do one jab
[1:20:46] <vaan_ratsbane> lmao elmo's 76k health
[1:20:50] <ArcadeDomination> classic move
[1:20:51] <%Lithdoran> More like squid
[1:20:53] <%sshen> Pat there's an aether current right in front of you
[1:21:13] <%Tallie> @AngriestPat there are 3 aether currents on the path
[1:21:15] <Everdarke> This music AngelThump
[1:21:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> 🤔
[1:21:21] <$shadow1man9> It's a REALLY big zone
[1:21:22] <ShichiNoBushi> Snails and nautilus are both molusks, but snails are gastropods and nautiluses are cephilopods.
[1:21:24] <+TheImmortal70> Is it now
[1:21:29] <+justianxix> LUL
[1:21:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> SOON
[1:21:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> PogChamp
[1:21:44] <%Divryne> Don’t worry Pat you’re in the worst part of this zone.
[1:21:47] <jackythefrost> It's the biggest zone in the game counting z-axis
[1:22:22] <sovayell> @AngriestPat are you planning to stream the raids / alliance raids when they come out?
[1:22:30] <ricotez> we subnautica now
[1:22:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Contain yourself Pat
[1:22:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> we aren't there yet
[1:22:41] <ricotez> you're in the blood kelp zone
[1:22:41] <Flickerember> MGS3 keeps playing in my head while tryna think about DARKNESS
[1:22:45] <Sol_Install> eww
[1:22:48] <Sol_Install> it squishy
[1:22:57] <Flickerember> I have to turn in my edge card
[1:23:03] <+notgac> none of those are available yet
[1:23:04] <Flickerember> Why coral squishy
[1:23:07] <StarMechV> squish.noises
[1:23:07] <ricotez> anenenenemone
[1:23:11] <+notgac> so you've time to recharge
[1:23:12] <ShichiNoBushi> It's... an enemy!
[1:23:14] <Flickerember> Would think they tough
[1:23:15] <cascadepersona> When is the Nier Raid?
[1:23:21] <ricotez> october
[1:23:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nier is in like 3 months
[1:23:22] <sovayell> 5.1 i think
[1:23:25] <+notgac> 5.1
[1:23:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> 5.1 yeah
[1:23:27] <切捨御免> Kreygasm
[1:23:31] <%MegboyManuel> I got a nier outfit ready already
[1:23:35] <%sshen> I hope nier turns into a text adventure halfway through the raid
[1:23:37] <baronvonkame> pat did you change your xp bar color somehow?
[1:23:43] <cascadepersona> Thanks chat
[1:23:45] <Flickerember> Nah he max
[1:23:47] <$Yakobro> @baronvonkame he's 80
[1:23:50] <snakesonabane> I hope the Nier raid erases your character data
[1:23:56] <sovayell> I want more bosses like Construct 7, those mechanics are stupid fun
[1:23:58] <Flickerember> and that rested xp isnt full so instead of blue its orange
[1:24:10] <sovayell> any mechanic that isnt just "RUN FROM ORANGE" is good
[1:24:11] <%Divryne> Sea penis.
[1:24:12] <cizal11> @AngriestPat don't miss the aether currents
[1:24:19] <%sshen> @sovayell I want them to make that mechanic mandatory, you'll keep the bads out with it
[1:24:36] <切捨御免> ew
[1:24:38] <%DeadStage> soon
[1:24:39] <$Yakobro> Kreygasm
[1:24:43] <ArcadeDomination> ugh squishy sounds
[1:24:47] <$Yakobro> guys... shut up
[1:24:49] <Fordrilin> I swear Shadowbringers MSQ is so much like Nier or Drakenquard it makes sense that we are getting a Nier raid.
[1:24:53] <moogleboy1984> that was the other FATE I forgot about. "The Friend of My Enemy is an Anemone to Me"
[1:24:56] <%MegboyManuel> arr mechanics are so underwhelming now post 5.0
[1:24:57] <ArcadeDomination> but the rest of this zone is gureito
[1:24:58] <%Lithdoran> Why would coral sound squishy?
[1:24:58] <sovayell> @sshen if I remember its just a damage buff if you do them correctly yeah?
[1:25:04] <snakesonabane> reminder that it's been over a year and 80% of the players still can't do elementary school math on Construct 7
[1:25:05] <+justianxix> underwater trench
[1:25:06] <%Lithdoran> Wouldn't coral sound like stone?
[1:25:07] <%Divryne> Guys get ready and shut up.
[1:25:08] <%Diabetic> I imagine that just is just awful with stank
[1:25:12] <%Typhaeon> Living coral isn't hard
[1:25:17] <%Divryne> Y’all are about to see some shit.
[1:25:20] <%MegboyManuel> div shush
[1:25:22] <%Kirijuo> Literal pre-k math
[1:25:23] <%sshen> @sovayell Yeah, each one you get right is a damage buff
[1:25:26] <Flickerember> But coral made of ded bodies
[1:25:36] <+Movemeister> ^
[1:25:36] <Flickerember> unless living layer on top
[1:25:41] <Thenuclearwalrus> Because its healthy? Kappa
[1:25:44] <ShichiNoBushi> Coral's mostly carbinate.
[1:25:45] <%Divryne> Living coral probably sounds like mush.
[1:25:46] <Flickerember> thatd be EDGE indeed
[1:25:52] <%Divryne> Dead coral is like stone for sure.
[1:25:56] <sovayell> @sshen i would hate it if it was a raid wide wipe. we would never advance
[1:26:08] <Flickerember> I feel I wouldnt want to touch living coral
[1:26:15] <sovayell> people still cant do basic addition
[1:26:16] <Flickerember> *Shiviering patrick meme*
[1:26:21] <%MegboyManuel> sbfpSetIn
[1:26:36] <sovayell> or learn the first three prime numbers
[1:26:58] <Flickerember> Im not here to math Im here to shoryuken gods
[1:26:58] <%BeeBotTheBig> BeeBotTheBig subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Hey pat haven't caught a stream in a while. to busy getting ready for my country superior celebration of independents
[1:27:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Cut away so they don't see the not animation.
[1:27:08] <sovayell> that framing looked ominous
[1:27:09] <+superdoomshroom> Oh boy it's time
[1:27:15] <sovayell> thought you were gonna explode with light again
[1:27:19] <+superdoomshroom> Or almost time
[1:27:20] <vaan_ratsbane> I love how many thousands came out with excuses after Construct-7 blasted them super hard with math 8 year olds can do
[1:27:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> The Time is Upon Us
[1:27:27] <Flickerember> Hes not excited enough yet
[1:27:37] <%DeadStage> he doesn't know what's coming
[1:27:37] <%sshen> @sovayell final trial of the story just becomes a math quiz instead
[1:27:42] <+StrawberryPantsu> YO
[1:27:49] <StarMechV> here we go
[1:27:52] <+StrawberryPantsu> This area music
[1:27:57] <jackythefrost> IT TIME
[1:28:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Music Intensifies*
[1:28:12] <Flickerember> I wont like Construct 7 messed me up but I just didnt understand the question. Like I could do the math but didnt know whatnI was supposed to be doing.
[1:28:15] <sovayell> @sshen if phantom train is barreling down upon you at 78 mph and... monkaS

[1:31:45] <Thenuclearwalrus> No
[1:31:45] <@JustinianKnight> no
[1:31:47] <+Zaver88> No
[1:31:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> Well, added the labels really
[1:31:48] <%SlowLikeThunder> Little bit better than the Ala Migan district huh LUL
[1:31:48] <+VidulaSaix> Bamboozled
[1:31:49] <%weissguard> Get to steppin' I guess.
[1:31:49] <baronvonkame> wait this game LEGIT fucks with the map size?
[1:31:50] <%MegboyManuel> no
[1:31:51] <+Krivvan> they added the Aetheryte, it wasn't there before
[1:31:52] <+notgac> no, you were just zoomed in
[1:31:53] <%Typhaeon> The markers were hidden
[1:31:53] <Thenuclearwalrus> The map pins were just invisible @AngriestPat
[1:31:54] <%Lithdoran> LUL
[1:31:54] <EsotericOdyssey> no it was always that large
[1:31:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> but that was all hidden until now
[1:31:58] <tigerbrows> i love the art deco aesthetic of this place
[1:31:59] <+superdoomshroom> The map was hiding all of the text
[1:32:02] <+TheImmortal70> No you just never realized that all of that deadzone was actual map
[1:32:08] <%vivinxs> just beat msq so now i get to watch Pat experience it :3
[1:32:09] <%MegboyManuel> they just hid shit initially
[1:32:19] <sovayell> @AngriestPat if you go back to the ondo village you can see the city clearly now, the game hides it from you till now
[1:32:23] <ShichiNoBushi> Would you kindly go to Andrew Ryan's office and kill that son of a bitch?
[1:32:24] <Thalchampz> LUL
[1:32:27] <vaan_ratsbane> giggity
[1:32:27] <+notgac> Kreygasm
[1:32:29] <%Lapinelis> Wait till you can fly through that
[1:32:31] <TuxedoNash> The Insomnia That Never Rapturekand
[1:32:32] <Thenuclearwalrus> They also didn't shot this region on the big map that shows all the zones
[1:32:33] <+Krivvan> what @TheImmortal70 said, it messed with the map size by omission and assumption
[1:32:33] <rosemon5001> this is some kh2 level shit whit that world in between
[1:32:36] <Graxe_> And according to the Ondo, all of this just appeared one day
[1:32:36] <+textandnumbers> that's what she said
[1:32:38] <Thenuclearwalrus> show*
[1:32:39] <baronvonkame> wait the game legit hides it even if you go to the exact spot you CAN see it??
[1:32:40] <%ArcanumMBD> it's crazy how this zone quickly goes from worst zone to best
[1:32:44] <jackythefrost> This is the new place people will AFK in just for the music and scenery
[1:32:45] <snakesonabane> imagine living in this city then going to living in a bunch of stick huts in Eorzea
[1:32:45] <%DeadStage> no gods only men
[1:32:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> ^
[1:32:45] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Make sure to use the Regalia for maximum effect
[1:32:47] <+VidulaSaix> This city is like my favorie thing in 14
[1:32:50] <%Dwarven_Gaming> LOVE the music here
[1:32:51] <vaan_ratsbane> it's always blured out by distance
[1:32:51] <+Krivvan> @baronvonkame: you can't normally come here until you unlock it
[1:32:54] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@StarMechV)
[1:32:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> Regalia Time yeah
[1:32:55] <$shadow1man9> Shoutout to the music change for this half of the map
[1:33:02] <cizal11> @baronvonkame you can't actually reach this spot until you can open that previous barrier
[1:33:03] <%MegboyManuel> worst zone to best zone. all it took was a tunnel
[1:33:04] <%ArcanumMBD> tick tick tick tock
[1:33:05] <+Double_Tap_That> This is probably my favorite zone as well
[1:33:07] <Thalchampz> this music is a bit personaey
[1:33:09] <Thenuclearwalrus> If you were to go on a new character and open the map to look at Norvrandt, you wouldn't see this portion of the preview map
[1:33:17] <+Krivvan> you can probably see if if you glitch your way through
[1:33:22] <+Movemeister> Getting persona-ish vibes from this song
[1:33:28] <sovayell> this music just makes me want to chill at cafe leblanc PepeHands
[1:33:31] <+sixcubit> "imposing door"
[1:33:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> Down down and down
[1:33:32] <Flickerember> I wish Emet was playing the music somewhere off screen
[1:33:32] <cizal11> this song is so fucking good
[1:33:37] <baronvonkame> @cizal11 no I know but when I flew out of it I saw there was a perfect spot to see if from the upper levels, does the game hide that before you go down?
[1:33:39] <+Double_Tap_That> The music is just amazing
[1:33:41] <$valriot> is THIS Anor Londo
[1:33:42] <%MegboyManuel> this whole place gives me zanarkand vibes
[1:33:42] <+Krivvan> @Thenuclearwalrus: Nah I saw this part of the map on the preview map, but I had no context
[1:33:44] <+VidulaSaix> How do you know he's not Flicker!
[1:33:45] <+BloodyBurney> this was the last possible thing you could have expected
[1:33:45] <quigley_plays> It wasn't built underwater
[1:33:45] <%vivinxs> i wish the City of the Ancients from 7 looked like this LOL
[1:33:46] <+Double_Tap_That> It's like a different game
[1:33:48] <@JustinianKnight> Versus XIII city
[1:33:48] <ricotez> this was the moment where Shadowbringers surpassed Heavensward for me
[1:33:51] <quigley_plays> It's much more anor londo than rapture
[1:33:56] <cizal11> @baronvonkame probably.
[1:33:56] <@Velyndra> Cool Lightning Land
[1:33:59] <Tenchi_G> Would you kindly
[1:33:59] <mimi3077> pfft he has no idea how accurate that is
[1:34:00] <Fordrilin> Rapture + Insomnia = THIS
[1:34:01] <Flickerember> Look through a window and he smiles at you and continues playing
[1:34:02] <%MegboyManuel> fucking versus 13
[1:34:03] <%Divryne> It’s more Insomnia from FFXV.
[1:34:05] <Thalchampz> EXCUSE ME
[1:34:05] <sovayell> Who else here thought the final zone was gonna be the Moon LUL
[1:34:06] <%demon_shadowplays> oh wow so you really have too explore the entire area to be detailed in your map.. shit...

[1:37:18] <%MegboyManuel> it's the unbroken language
[1:37:19] <Flickerember> @sovayell Ah thx. I mean healer meant to heal so while I do understand, would think tanks melting and extreme mana conservation would not be considered dull
[1:37:21] <Thenuclearwalrus> Adults are scary
[1:37:30] <+BloodyBurney> do you remember emet telling about this place pat?
[1:37:50] <+TheImmortal70> The 14
[1:37:53] <Flickerember> Ascians mana tanks are huge
[1:37:53] <%theturtlebar> This entire place is based off of the old Greek story of "Utopia"
[1:37:56] <Thalchampz> heh, the XIV
[1:37:58] <%theturtlebar> It's really cool
[1:38:07] <%MegboyManuel> the FOURTEEN
[1:38:10] <sovayell> @Flickerember i dont mind it, and I do agree healing should be made to be more fun (thats on the devs to work), but i can understand why people are salty. people who enjoy healing arent affected
[1:38:11] <Everdarke> They're so friendly
[1:38:13] <%demegodz> Can you hold my hand big lady

[1:40:01] <sovayell> technically everyone was an ascian pat
[1:40:01] <EsotericOdyssey> one of those shards being the void
[1:40:12] <%JGardner88> No it's 10 plus 3 and the source
[1:40:12] <%MegboyManuel> they were the fore runners
[1:40:13] <+lucaflow> Everyone was an ascian then got split when the worlds fractured
[1:40:15] <Inollia> 14 shards including the sources, 7 of them already destroyed, and you are trying to save the first one from the same fate
[1:40:15] <Flickerember> Why you break the world Pat
[1:40:17] <+MisterCrimson> @TG_Cid11 7 shards have been rejoined leaving worlds of unchecked elements like the Void
[1:40:19] <%Lithdoran> I thought it was the 13 Shards and the Source?
[1:40:37] <EsotericOdyssey> nah the void isn't rejoined
[1:40:38] <+iheartmota> When you are so lonely you made a city that you remembered before it got destroyed for aoens
[1:40:41] <EsotericOdyssey> they futzed that one up
[1:40:44] <+justianxix> a lot of talk
[1:40:45] <TuxedoNash> We really were the Final Fantasy Fourteen after all.
[1:40:52] <%Roundelay11> These guys SUPER didn't deserve what happened to them, unlike most other videogame ancient races
[1:40:55] <%MegboyManuel> man emets just a really tired guy
[1:41:00] <Flickerember> @angriestpat I hope you still like anime. Thats all Im gonna say.
[1:41:02] <Fordrilin> Talk to all of the locals
[1:41:03] <+lucaflow> The screwed up when trying to rejoin one of the worlds
[1:41:05] <+justianxix> we must get lore
[1:41:06] <%Lapinelis> Pat, listen to the music closely, and thing about what happens tomorrow
[1:41:10] <TuxedoNash> Get ready to feel like a Lalafell
[1:41:13] <Inollia> the void rejoined, its now the world of darkness, where the voidsents come from. its the last shard to have been destroyed and probably the one which cause the 7th umbral calamity
[1:41:17] <$SleepyMaribo> if it turns out were just an ascion thats gonna be a trip
[1:41:20] <%demegodz> Oh shit this is gunna be the apatBig anime
[1:41:20] <%ArcanumMBD> @MisterCrimson That's wrong. When a world is rejoined there's nothing left. The void wasn't rejoined, it got completely fucked.
[1:41:27] <$shadow1man9> It's a good idea to talk to literally every NPC here
[1:41:28] <Flickerember> Pat could never escape from being towered upon
[1:41:29] <%ElenaManetta> awwww pat's so bummed
[1:41:31] <gekizenbu> emmet just wants to go home but it involves murdering everyelse
[1:41:32] <+Krivvan> I really like how the environment theme changes context here
[1:41:36] <Flickerember> Even as roe he is still smol
[1:41:38] <Thenuclearwalrus> @demegodz This whole expansion has been Big Anime
[1:41:39] <vaan_ratsbane> this is so like irythill and the phantom knights
[1:41:45] <EsotericOdyssey> they explicitly say they made a "useless void" out of the 13th
[1:41:50] <%MegboyManuel> emet is tired and sad. everyone relate
[1:41:51] <%Diabetic> I like this a lot better than FFXI's story, where it was damn near next to impossible to complete shit due to level cap and certain jobs only being the way to go because of that. The Rank 1-10 quests were great but then you get to Chains of Promathia and to see any of the story it was a stone BITCH
[1:41:52] <EsotericOdyssey> that's the one voidsent come from
[1:41:55] <%Kirijuo> I know it's an mmo but seeing other people in this area super breaks my immersion
[1:42:10] <切捨御免> kind of
[1:42:11] <bestwaifuritsu> I strongly suggest you listen to everything the non quest npcs have to say too
[1:42:12] <+VidulaSaix> Seems like it
[1:42:16] <%MegboyManuel> apatBig
[1:42:20] <切捨御免> less ghostly in reality, probably
[1:42:29] <%MegboyManuel> Asians were apatBig
[1:42:34] <%ArcanumMBD> Who is ready for apatBig lore?
[1:42:35] <%MegboyManuel> wait auto-correct
[1:42:39] <cizal11> legit can't see over the desk lmao
[1:42:41] <Inollia> one shard was destroyed by darkness though so which is it ?
[1:42:42] <%DeadStage> i got here really early, day 2 of early launch, so it was empty for me. real nice and quiet
[1:42:43] <vaan_ratsbane> This is the podcast emporium
[1:42:44] <Thenuclearwalrus> @EsotericOdyssey the thing that went wrong with the 13th is that it was flooded with shadow at a time when the source was NOT having any sort of shadowy crisis, so a rejoining could not occur
[1:42:47] <%VioletHeart> Someone sliding into the zone in a car ruined the atmosphere completely.
[1:42:48] <+notgac> big bois with big poise
[1:42:54] <%Lapinelis> My character was a lala
[1:42:56] <+BloodyBurney> this is the platonic ideal of a city
[1:42:56] <+lucaflow> The 13th got destroyed by too much edge
[1:42:57] <%demegodz> Podcast Museum
[1:42:59] <%Lapinelis> I was literally the size of their foot
[1:42:59] <Thunderwalrus> now i think we will see an expantion where we go to the void to try and fix it
[1:43:00] <%weissguard> So TINY
[1:43:05] <%weissguard> LUL
[1:43:16] <SailingSaturn> I think other Player Characters enhance the area cirISee
[1:43:18] <vaan_ratsbane> now YOU are the potato Pat
[1:43:20] <EsotericOdyssey> @Thenuclearwalrus I know I'm saying the 13th isn't rejoined
[1:43:30] <%Kirijuo> Acsians were super nice people, that fucking sucks seeing what happened to them
[1:43:34] <Inollia> when the exarch shows you the differents shards we see 7 shards being destroyed : wind, lightning, fire, earth, ice, water and then darkness in that order
[1:43:36] <snakesonabane> elidibus is a fucking idiot though, what went wrong
[1:43:37] <CrypticMochi> So the lala are literally 1/14th of a person
[1:43:41] <cizal11> soon to be left vacant
[1:44:02] <%Afterman_> @crypticmochi all are 1/14th
[1:46:48] <+GeneralOrangutan> bbb

[1:49:18] <%Fatmanjoggin> They are not wrong
[1:49:19] <cizal11> they are absolutely right about that
[1:49:19] <XyraFhoan> definitely is
[1:49:20] <+Kelpus> I mean, do you want to skip this crazy lorebomb?

[1:49:24] <Thenuclearwalrus> @AngriestPat It is also VITAL that you stop looking at chat right NOW

[1:49:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Did these guys have replicators?
[1:50:05] <sovayell> testing
[1:50:07] <BunnyEmperor> Time to main scenario roulette while watching Pat LUL
[1:50:13] <snakesonabane> these guys can create anything with their big dick aether pools
[1:50:14] <+Raidou24> Ascians were all Green Lanterns
[1:50:18] <+Truthmoon> I love this zone
[1:50:23] <$shadow1man9> They can just think really hard and make stuff real
[1:50:29] <%Lapinelis> Ascians made lunch by summoning a primal Sandwich, Pat.
[1:50:33] <%DesertPenguin09> What is this JRPG shit?
[1:50:34] <CrypticMochi> Test
[1:50:35] <+BloodBladexX> yo wait
[1:50:40] <cizal11> literally primal summoning is just something they could do easily, but we're too shit
[1:50:40] <+Kelpus> I mean it's a JRPG LUL
[1:50:41] <+BloodBladexX> what happened to minfillia's hair
[1:50:49] <%Lithdoran> Why is minifilia's hair red?
[1:50:50] <SailingSaturn> story stuff
[1:50:50] <$Yakobro> @BloodBladexX spoilers

[1:51:11] <alrobot2014> noo she's Baseball
[1:51:31] <%Lithdoran> @DesertPenguin09 No, next week is Justice Eyes
[1:51:33] <%demegodz> Buddy system
[1:51:35] <@DariusFTL> Basebalisaie
[1:51:36] <SargentToughie> Somebody mind letting me in on the Baseball joke?
[1:51:41] <Flickerember> Imma not front why call her baseball?
[1:51:43] <%DesertPenguin09> Okay I'll check that out
[1:51:45] <%RittiFruity> I want blond Baseboll back
[1:51:47] <$SleepyMaribo> why do you call her baseball?
[1:51:48] <baronvonkame> so baseball is confirmed? that's just what we're doing now?
[1:51:49] <CrypticMochi> Yay I’m back, twitch logged me out and wouldn’t let me back in for some time
[1:51:53] <%pittbulldogg> wheres chat :( damn u twitch
[1:51:56] <%ElenaManetta> yeah, take the day off, that's what you said THIS WEEK
[1:51:59] <%ElenaManetta> you gaming junkie
[1:52:00] <sovayell> ayy we back?
[1:52:15] <cizal11> he hates the hat so much
[1:52:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Aren't they all patronizing referring to you all as children?
[1:52:21] <+Kelpus> Holy hell, a Lightning cluster! PogChamp
[1:52:25] <%DesertPenguin09> Detroit Become Human is free on PS+ this month so plenty of plenty can try it themselves after watching you twice lol and paige
[1:52:34] <Nitesco> Paige named Ryne Baseball @SargentToughie so naturally everyone calls her Baseball here now
[1:52:36] <+VidulaSaix> I fucknig love Ascians LUL
[1:52:38] <SailingSaturn> Anti-Pat LUL
[1:52:42] <+lucaflow> Is he saying your hat is dumb?
[1:52:44] <glitchedmatt1> Chat is back PogChamp
[1:52:47] <+Dogbert24> oh shit the ascians are dirty commies
[1:52:49] <gekizenbu> finally twitch chat servers working
[1:52:50] <StarMechV> Oh good this is a Ascian Boomer
[1:52:57] <%Lapinelis> Pat, he just talked shit about your hat
[1:52:59] <%theturtlebar> @AngriestPat Did you ever expect this expansion to make Ascians actually compelling?
[1:53:05] <+Kelpus> Going by how they treat you... di Ascians like... grow like crabs? Like... always growing. LUL
[1:53:08] <SargentToughie> Oh, makes sense
[1:53:11] <切捨御免> he called you DIMINUITIVE
[1:53:13] <+Kelpus> So woudl the oldest Ascians be like, 20ft tall?
[1:53:14] <snakesonabane> "what the FUCK did you just say about my hat"
[1:53:15] <%Lithdoran> Communism killed the original star
[1:53:19] <+lucaflow> He's using a lot of words just to say your hat is shit
[1:53:20] <vaan_ratsbane> Ascians are godlike beings even as babies, unity is vital to keep someone from blowing a city up
[1:53:35] <Flickerember> Twitch jokes are too real for me
[1:53:39] <Foggysheep> giant space communist cult
[1:54:05] <snakesonabane> they kneel down to talk to a roe, do they have to lie prone to talk to a lala?
[1:57:10] <+Kelpus> Like, just go there if you want an argument LUL
[1:57:52] <Everdarke> You learn so much around this part of the game
[1:58:03] <+Kelpus> Yeah it's surreal.
[1:58:11] <Flickerember> Ascians shpuld learn you some stuff
[1:58:14] <%theturtlebar> I like that a guy just accidentally created griffons. Half eagle, half lion
[1:58:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> I feel like I'm playing Pillars again
[1:58:19] <SSD_Stryker> my jaw was on the ground for like this whole part of the game
[1:58:24] <%Dynamoheart> He's super right
[1:58:26] <Everdarke> Same
[1:58:30] <ArcadeDomination> galaxy brain ascians
[1:58:30] <+EmperorWeeb> dude this is actually the best part of the expac
[1:58:30] <%Roundelay11> These guys are like the ideal society of godlike beings
[1:58:35] <jackythefrost> Wait until he reaches the dungeon
[1:58:36] <+Kelpus> He created a griffons because he got ever so slighty distracted while wishing up a thought. ScaredyCat
[1:58:45] <snakesonabane> ascians were fucking nerds lmao i'm glad they went extinct Kappa
[1:58:49] <切捨御免> this place is COOL?
[1:59:03] <+MisterCrimson> It's the story of Utopia
[1:59:20] <%Lapinelis> And you thought the intro to the expansion was good.
[1:59:22] <$NitronStreams> can someone put this section side by side with the tom commercial LUL
[1:59:27] <moogleboy1984> Without flaw, there is no motivation to strive to better yourself
[1:59:28] <+Karasseram> FFXIV no forcing you to think
[1:59:32] <+Karasseram> *now
[1:59:37] <+Karasseram> philosophy inc
[1:59:43] <+Dogbert24> become one with the borg, diversity is stupid my dude
[1:59:46] <XrosHawk> Galaxy Brain
[1:59:49] <+Kelpus> You can really see things from Emets point of view from all this.
[1:59:51] <%Giggalith> Hydaelyn vs. Zodiark
[1:59:53] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah, Canada is worthless
[1:59:54] <Flickerember> @angriestpat dont confuse me I am only here to punch stuff
[1:59:56] <%ElenaManetta> apatDab
[1:59:57] <+lucaflow> This really explains why all the ascians we've run into talk to us like we're dumb as shit
[1:59:58] <+VidulaSaix> The debate between these two was one of my favorite things
[2:00:04] <+VidulaSaix> I had to remind myself I was laying FF14 LUL
[2:00:06] <%theturtlebar> Also think about it like this: if you are a being that is eternal, how scary would the concept of termination (mortality and death) be to you?
[2:00:07] <StarMechV> Galaxy Brain City
[2:00:08] <+VidulaSaix> playing*
[2:00:16] <+Kelpus> We ARE dumb as shit. Compared to them LUL
[2:00:18] <SSD_Stryker> someone on reddit made a post on how there are a ton of references here to Thomas More's Utopia
[2:00:21] <ArcadeDomination> multiverse brain
[2:00:25] <Nikit0sBarb0s> Is it you so tiny or it's them so tall?
[2:00:26] <ShichiNoBushi> Seems analogous with optimal "builds" or suboptimal individual character builds.
[2:00:30] <+SlumberMan> It's funny that the Garleans seem super deadset on the "perfect" idea and don't consider the other side that these guys do
[2:00:54] <%Lithdoran> These fuckers are really going to discuss foreign humanitarian aid?
[2:00:56] <+Kelpus> That's because Garleans just have an inferiority complex about not being able to use magic tbh Kappa
[2:01:03] <+notgac> it sounds like they start sentences with "Boiii"
[2:01:08] <$NitronStreams> I cant believe they put politics in my MMO LUL
[2:01:23] <StarMechV> This is some Serial Experiment Lain level shit
[2:01:24] <+Karasseram> agreed
[2:01:26] <%korth367> these dialogue make my thonk in pain
[2:01:27] <BlacSoul> Theyre so genuine its cute, but worrying
[2:01:28] <+Karasseram> I choose the same
[2:01:31] <@DariusFTL> Louisoix'd
[2:01:31] <%Lithdoran> Do the Louisoix quote!
[2:01:35] <%VioletHeart> Isn't that the Louisoix quote?
[2:01:36] <%VioletHeart> That's cute.
[2:01:37] <+Kelpus> Translaitng this must have been terror tbh
[2:01:39] <SailingSaturn> I mean they're all god-like enties with power of creation so Its seems like a worthy debate cirISee
[2:01:42] <bear_breaker20> "save"
[2:01:48] <+Kelpus> Japanese, English, Dutch/German and French... and to k eep it all the same
[2:01:51] <+Karasseram> Koji works directly with the writers
[2:01:52] <+Kelpus> NotLikeThis
[2:01:59] <Flickerember> When everyone can solve the problem debates work better
[2:02:00] <+Karasseram> that helps
[2:02:01] <snakesonabane> Ascians spend their free time having internet arguments
[2:02:06] <The_Shiznet> 5Head ah yes most indubitably
[2:02:08] <cizal11> LIL BIT
[2:02:08] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:02:10] <%vivinxs> I WAS JUST THINKING THAT
[2:02:12] <kaze7897> Lil bit
[2:02:14] <MasterDecoder> Yea
[2:02:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> I love Kreia so much
[2:02:16] <$SleepyMaribo> so wait
[2:02:17] <SSD_Stryker> kreia did nothing wrong
[2:02:21] <sovayell> 14Head yeseth
[2:02:23] <alrobot2014> he makes me wanna destroy the force
[2:02:37] <cizal11> i'm sad this wasn't way longer than it was, but i'm glad it was here
[2:02:43] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat So is this what ascians looked like or are this what ascians ghost look like?
[2:02:49] <%Lithdoran> Both?
[2:03:04] <+notgac> it's like "How to Be Perfect in 3 Days"
[2:03:07] <bear_breaker20> good thing for climate change*
[2:03:10] <$SleepyMaribo> if they are all powerful to the point they can will into existence anything, why didnt they just will into existence a solu- oh... zodiark... nvm
[2:03:11] <SailingSaturn> @Gogogolem its unclear cirThink
[2:03:13] <+Kelpus> Maybe a bit of both. They are just wearing mortal skins, their concept of existence is compeltely different so... yeah, maybe they looked like this
[2:03:17] <Flickerember> "Man thx for arguing with me"
[2:03:18] <+TheImmortal70> Its both
[2:03:25] <+iheartmota> Free speech promoter ascian
[2:03:26] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah there should have been more here but its fair considering its fucking empty LUL
[2:03:31] <$Yakobro> @SleepyMaribo zodiark... had a cost... you'll see
[2:03:31] <bashful_bard> This adds a lot of context to garlemald's crazy philosophy
[2:03:32] <+Double_Tap_That> Ironic for a game made in Japan
[2:03:35] <snakesonabane> isn't it really weird that Zodiark was LAW and Hydaelyn was CHAOS all along?
[2:03:36] <vaan_ratsbane> They probably were normal people, just tall, but they're greyed out because Emet only created what he remembered, which was the city and the fact there were people, just not specific people
[2:03:36] <+TheImmortal70> Theyre shades but def had the masks robes etc
[2:03:36] <+SlumberMan> This definitely seems like something Obsidian would write, only without the dash of cynicism
[2:03:37] <+REDtheBEAST> ScaredyCat
[2:03:46] <Flickerember> MAN I want an Ascian to look into the camera while saying that
[2:03:48] <%Lapinelis> So, an hour in, how are you liking the new zone
[2:03:49] <+Double_Tap_That> Talking about the wonders of public discourse
[2:03:58] <%Lapinelis> also can you hear the clock literally ticking?
[2:03:59] <%Kyma1020> So your telling me
[2:04:01] <Huntercd> master debater hat
[2:04:08] <+TheImmortal70> Was never law/chaos
[2:04:09] <+VidulaSaix> It is isnt it
[2:04:11] <%Kyma1020> I have the potential to be a master debater?
[2:04:14] <StarMechV> This feels like.someting I'd expect Yoko Taro to do
[2:04:15] <kaze7897> This zone is a mix of awe and sadness
[2:04:16] <%Valdorick> Man, I suddenly understand what Pat meant when he said logging out in this zone would give you HUGE spoilers on the load screen
[2:04:17] <+notgac> *sad jazz intensifies*
[2:04:18] <+Karasseram> its going ot get better too
[2:04:26] <+justianxix> feels real chill in this zone
[2:04:26] <%Dwarven_Gaming> this zone is my background
[2:04:27] <Angry_Ev1L> I beat it and this shit is still crazy to me lol
[2:04:27] <%Dwarven_Gaming> no joke
[2:04:31] <jackythefrost> WHALE
[2:04:31] <$SleepyMaribo> ok but if the plan was doomed from the start, why are the ascions repeating the same mistake?
[2:04:32] <vaan_ratsbane> please be excited for Debater for the next limited job, they talk the mobs to death
[2:04:36] <+TheImmortal70> Its power unabated versus a check/counterbalance
[2:04:39] <chronoxgp> was that bismark jus flying off??
[2:04:44] <%Lapinelis> I so love this music. It's so melancholic
[2:04:47] <%Kirijuo> I really hope that this kind of civilization will come back in later expansions, these guys are super interesting
[2:04:51] <cizal11> lmao
[2:04:53] <+Kelpus> The nier stuff isn't even here yet Star :D
[2:04:54] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:04:56] <Fordrilin> The melancholy of this zone and the constant tick just makes me...sad
[2:04:56] <+superkeaton> LUL
[2:05:01] <baronvonkame> wait did pat spoil tthe city reveal for himself with the login?
[2:05:01] <The_Shiznet> D:
[2:05:01] <fehraf> OOF
[2:05:02] <sovayell> @SleepyMaribo even demi-gods arent immune to arrogance
[2:05:02] <kaze7897> @SleepyMaribo It's the only way for them to bring their people back
[2:05:04] <bear_breaker20> kinda sucks that every npc is near identical here tho
[2:05:06] <Flickerember> Emet either tempered hard so gotta do it or he NEEDS his friends and family back he is so lonely
[2:05:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ayyy chat's no longer invisible
[2:05:10] <+MisterCrimson> bitch we got glamours
[2:05:12] <%Lithdoran> SleepyMaribo: They're not, they're trying to kill Hydaelen and rejoin all the shards back to the Source so they get their star back.
[2:05:14] <+VidulaSaix> @bear_breaker20 Thats kind of the point
[2:05:17] <+Karasseram> There is a nier mention in this place
[2:05:18] <%Valdorick> Ah yes, the Orator Job. "Mimic Ascians" is the strongest, but longest cast time attack in the game.
[2:05:21] <Huntercd> Giant ladies?
[2:05:21] <$Yakobro> @Flickerember it's sort of both
[2:05:22] <+Karasseram> hope pat finds it
[2:05:24] <+SlumberMan> @SleepyMaribo Because they're constantly reminded of everything they lost over who knows how many millions of years ago. Emet just wants to go back home at this point.
[2:05:36] <+TheImmortal70> Yes
[2:05:43] <%Lapinelis> Yes
[2:05:45] <%VioletHeart> I mean... there's a reason the ascians think we're weak and awful. It's because we are.
[2:05:50] <+TheImmortal70> Why no create with thoughts
[2:05:51] <Nitesco> at least they were kind about it :)
[2:05:54] <+Dogbert24> there is actually a hooded robe thats like lvl 10 or something that looks exactly like what these guys are wearing with the mask
[2:05:56] <$Yakobro> @StarMechV even kids here can materialize stuff, so the clerk just assumes you have low aptitude at it
[2:06:07] <vaan_ratsbane> big ascian lupus
[2:06:08] <%demegodz> Creation Disabled
[2:06:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> I love when games turn into Philosophy sparring simulator.
[2:06:26] <ShichiNoBushi> Patron is uncreative.
[2:06:27] <ArcadeDomination> how can this creation power BE?!
[2:06:27] <Mexrage> where you expecting something like this zone last week for this expansion? i guess this is why yoship said that the release trailer reveal are not big deal by comparison, Pat
[2:06:27] <Flickerember> @yakobro So kinda like MK revenants with enough of them inside to make the thing they doin feel 100% right
[2:06:37] <%crowsloft77> So are Ascians just anti-spirals but less preachy?
[2:06:37] <%Valdorick> Oh... Oh wait... Ooooooooooh… That's how Emet is able to reform his body, instead of needing to body hop.
[2:06:41] <snakesonabane> I mean, Lahabrea was supposedly one of the smartest of these people yet he has an unironic evil laugh and gets punked by Thordan like a bitch
[2:06:43] <%Gogogolem> These guys seem to think Pats some kind little baby.
[2:06:45] <%Valdorick> He just thinks of his body, and creates a new one.
[2:06:59] <%demegodz> @Gogogolem They're right though
[2:07:02] <+Fynale> CHAT IS BACK
[2:07:02] <+TheImmortal70> No its literally a emet clone room
[2:07:03] <SSD_Stryker> the fanfic section in the bureau must be huge
[2:07:07] <+Dogbert24> like that sarin gas concept, keep that shit under wraps
[2:07:12] <bear_breaker20> lol
[2:07:12] <+Fynale> can someone tell chat to reload his phone
[2:07:15] <$Yakobro> @snakesonabane apparently his constant body hopping had side effects, at least emet said that earlier
[2:07:17] <vaan_ratsbane> and all fanfics must be shared for the sake of the society
[2:07:21] <%TG_Cid11> yeah he has clones back at the Source
[2:07:22] <bear_breaker20> bad ideas are bad
[2:07:27] <+TheImmortal70> The garleans have an emet clone room
[2:07:28] <+MisterCrimson> how many inflated sonics are in the containment room?
[2:07:38] <$Yakobro> YEAH
[2:07:43] <%Honaoko> @Valdorick nah,if you remember there was just clone factory on the Source for Emet.
[2:07:43] <+VidulaSaix> Dickbutt?
[2:07:44] <%Valdorick> Clones are just as funny.
[2:07:48] <vaan_ratsbane> LUL
[2:07:52] <%demegodz> Dickbutt? DENIED
[2:07:55] <%MagickBurritoh> This is a cool area
[2:07:55] <BunnyEmperor> PepeHands I worked years on this
[2:07:59] <MasterDecoder> I like their voices
[2:08:07] <Flickerember> They denied memes
[2:08:09] <ShichiNoBushi> I like when they kneel down condescendingly.
[2:08:12] <+SlumberMan> Pat would be the one thinking of Ass the Movie if this was Idiocracy
[2:08:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is this what these goobers actually look like, or are they just astral projecting their anon suits?
[2:08:14] <Flickerember> Thats why they failed
[2:08:17] <+Movemeister> DRIFLOON? :O
[2:08:19] <Angry_Ev1L> denied? this is bullshit! CREATIVE fREEDOM WutFace BabyRage
[2:08:20] <%Dynamoheart> aurelias
[2:08:21] <%TG_Cid11> he made a jellyfish
[2:08:22] <+MisterCrimson> Aurelias
[2:08:23] <Huntercd> Little dog yo!!
[2:08:24] <Parapattern> Good self expression is never subversive Kappa
[2:08:27] <snakesonabane> The real reason behind the Final Days is that the Ascians created Mickey Mouse with their minds and got annihilated by Disney's lawyers
[2:08:29] <BlacSoul> air jellyfigh?
[2:08:34] <ArcadeDomination> Ascian Deviantart
[2:08:34] <redrins> a farting jellyfish
[2:08:36] <%VioletHeart> It propels itself with gas? So it's literally the farting butt Pat just described?
[2:08:48] <cizal11> he made all those floating anemones you've seen the entire game
[2:08:48] <+Dogbert24> its like a furries paradise
[2:08:50] <%Fatmanjoggin> He didn't make A jellyfish he made jellyfish
[2:08:54] <%Lapinelis> @VioletHeart Yes.
[2:09:00] <ricotez> automata?
[2:09:02] <BlacSoul> People?
[2:09:02] <+Karasseram> Nier mention
[2:09:02] <+VidulaSaix> Autonomous, emotionless figures?

[2:09:25] <%daveglhf> is this the Nier tie in?
[2:09:28] <%Gogogolem> Patron what is this you've drawn? Its a guy with a butt but his but has a dick coming out of it. I call it dickbutt. This will not be approved for wider distribution to amaurat society.
[2:09:30] <+Karasseram> Yes they made 2b
[2:09:32] <snakesonabane> the drakengard universe is just a creation of the ascians confirmed, and don't lie, yoko taro would totally make that canon

[2:10:12] <mimi3077> OOOOH thats why moogles know about the first umbral calamity
[2:10:13] <%TG_Cid11> Drakengard is one of the shards @snakesonabane
[2:10:17] <MagicMuffinx> this place made me feel real sad for the Ascians, they had a neat society
[2:10:23] <+VidulaSaix> @TG_Cid11 No its not lmao
[2:10:23] <cizal11> concept matrix lmfao
[2:10:34] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat these quests are lvl 70 and can be done on other classes for exp

[2:10:47] <ShichiNoBushi> "Don't be afraid to play rough"? Is he proposing some monster collecting game?
[2:10:47] <+SlumberMan> If Drakengard was one of the shards, it would have been swallowed by darkness so long go

[2:11:19] <Flickerember> slembals
[2:11:22] <%theturtlebar> Yeah, a bunch of different monsters were fucking invented down here
[2:11:24] <Parapattern> Children love the various S L I M E S
[2:11:25] <+Dogbert24> especially when the slimeballs kill you
[2:11:26] <vaan_ratsbane> he created the Secret Slime Action
[2:11:29] <ShichiNoBushi> Gross your sister out!!
[2:11:32] <+chemtrailsgaming> All knowing beings everyone
[2:11:33] <+REDtheBEAST> Oh its like play do
[2:11:34] <ArcadeDomination> cancelled immediately
[2:11:35] <%Lapinelis> Oh I didn't notice before that this area didn't have the combat music
[2:11:36] <snakesonabane> this ascian was forever banished to the dragon quest universe
[2:11:39] <kanodin> he made playdough
[2:11:40] <Flickerember> We thought slime was bad today
[2:11:41] <+Starlight_Gamer> Its g'k
[2:11:41] <jackythefrost> @cizal11 Pat turned off the combat music, thats why
[2:11:42] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat Flans, not you, were the gods' most perfect creation
[2:11:43] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat So pat its possible all the monsters in the universe were supposed to be ascian pets that guy made?
[2:11:45] <%demegodz> Bye-Byeeeee!
[2:11:46] <%DeadStage> it's all fun and games until the slime figures out tentacles

[2:11:48] <SSD_Stryker> ascians created gak
[2:11:48] <%NYCrownlessKing> ascians made hentai
[2:11:48] <Jeemukun> they're fucking dango colored too
[2:11:51] <%demegodz> Cute goos
[2:11:55] <+Kelpus> now you know who to blame LUL
[2:11:56] <%Valdorick> Gak Playthings - make sure Tinathina never gets to kiss her boy friend
[2:11:56] <cizal11> @jackythefrost he turned out mount music, not sure you can turn off combat music. maybe i missed something
[2:11:58] <%Mev852_> Bring white chlorination syndrome to FF14 cowards!
[2:11:59] <ArcadeDomination> Ascian Gooigi
[2:12:02] <%NYCrownlessKing> doodInjury doodTerror
[2:12:08] <vaan_ratsbane> nah Pat didnt turn it off, ever since mt gulg arc, the battle music stopped playing to highlight the area music
[2:12:09] <Flickerember> Ascian Otaku sounds really funny
[2:12:13] <+zanzibar_junker> Digimon
[2:12:16] <cizal11> @jackythefrost nevermind i did miss something lol
[2:12:17] <+MisterCrimson> the robe dude accidentally created a griffin
[2:12:17] <%Plaguemelon> apatSkelmo apatSkelmo apatSkelmo apatSkelmo apatSkelmo
[2:12:21] <baronvonkame> one ascian made jellyfish tbh, that's pretty nice
[2:12:22] <%korth367> they made chocobos
[2:12:22] <%crowsloft77> crowsloft77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:12:24] <Inollia> one ascian created the king turd in arboretum hard
[2:12:25] <+Double_Tap_That> The lion that became an eagle probably became a griffon
[2:12:26] <Parapattern> SUCKED
[2:12:29] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat there's one you can talk to in idle convo that describes him accidently making a gryphon while trying to make a lion
[2:12:31] <%Ranryu692> oh man, this is some Final Fantasy endgame music
[2:12:35] <kanodin> 100% the nier raid will be concepts made by ascians
[2:12:37] <%Maids4lyfe> Ascian: "I want my dessert to try to eat me back."
[2:12:41] <+justianxix> they're behind everything!
[2:12:44] <+VidulaSaix> @Fynale Manticore actually
[2:12:45] <%Valdorick> As long we don't find out that Malbaros are just Ascian Fleshlights.
[2:12:48] <+chemtrailsgaming> Ascians were the original nickoleodean slimers
[2:12:55] <+DisasterJensen> so the ascicans are like... the original alagans
[2:13:03] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[2:13:04] <%TG_Cid11> Everything is an Ascian fanfic do not steal their OC
[2:13:08] <bestwaifuritsu> the guy that accidentally made a griffin was quite...sloppeh
[2:13:08] <%NYCrownlessKing> this means the ascians probably created all the monsters
[2:13:09] <Flickerember> Should I give up and watch nier lp since its harder and harder to avoid
[2:13:13] <切捨御免> shop fuck
[2:13:16] <+Fynale> well considering the ascians made allag maybe
[2:13:17] <cizal11> they make the original allagans look like children. or teenagers i guess, compared to us.
[2:13:18] <Parapattern> That guy was a flubber fetishist
[2:13:18] <Inollia> one fucked up ascian is like "what if we created giant demon babies ? with teeth and who eat people ?" and thats how this ascian created the nier universe
[2:13:19] <%VioletHeart> I mean earlier on we found out the Ascians made the Alagan empire too, so
[2:13:25] <%VioletHeart> they're also the Alagans.
[2:13:28] <snakesonabane> even the illusionary creations of your mortal enemy will take your gil
[2:13:29] <alrobot2014> what's the need for shops when you can will things into existence
[2:13:30] <cizal11> also look how fuckin big this aetheryte is
[2:13:34] <+superdoomshroom> The aetherite is huge here too
[2:13:37] <bashful_bard> No
[2:13:47] <vaan_ratsbane> alag was manipulated the same way garlemald is being now
[2:13:47] <docstrangelove> Lvl 80 craftted gear isn't released yet
[2:13:49] <%Lapinelis> Remember this aetheryte design?
[2:13:55] <+Karasseram> I cant wait to fish in this city
[2:14:01] <cizal11> @AngriestPat that's just the bottom of it lmao, it's way bigger than you saw
[2:14:08] <+Karasseram> ill fish for hours with tihs msuic
[2:14:10] <SSD_Stryker> I was worried the last area would be empty like the other expansions but the emptiness feels right here
[2:14:27] <MagicMuffinx> The Ascians weren't all knowing, only to a point. They influenced creation but even before their fall they didn't exactly go out of their way to control everything
[2:14:28] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat i have a running theory that the reason the new world is so fucked up is because taht's where "across the ocean is" in this time
[2:14:41] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat If you haven't already, after completing the last role and class quest, there's a familiar NPC in Crystarium that gives you your artifact gear
[2:14:45] <moogleboy1984> It's Amuro, and we came from space just to laugh at it
[2:14:56] <+Fynale> @MisterCrimson he has his af gear
[2:15:05] <cizal11> it's FUCKIN big
[2:15:05] <glitchedmatt1> @AngriestPat They keep talking about children, wouldn't a functionally immortal race need to halt reproduction to avoid overpopulation?
[2:15:07] <+Karasseram> MisterCrimson he wouldnt be able to go here without already doing that
[2:15:09] <%NYCrownlessKing> no. @mistercrimson that guy is in tempest
[2:15:16] <Everdarke> Look below the aetheryte from the platforms
[2:15:21] <%Lapinelis> How it feels playing a lala pat?
[2:15:26] <jackythefrost> @MisterCrimson It's the guy in the tempest, not the crystaruim
[2:15:37] <%NYCrownlessKing> hows it feel being a lala pat
[2:15:37] <Everdarke> Not sure if you can get low enough without flying
[2:16:00] <%Valdorick> Wait... so does that mean Miqote was just an Ascian going "what if I could fuck my cat!?"
[2:16:10] <%korth367> waiting
[2:16:11] <+Fynale> Zimbardo?
[2:16:11] <%NYCrownlessKing> yes Kappa
[2:16:13] <+justianxix> this really is the Lalafel experience
[2:16:15] <%demegodz> waitying
[2:16:18] <$NitronStreams> waiting
[2:16:22] <ShichiNoBushi> That should be like a 15 minute bar.
[2:16:25] <+chemtrailsgaming> The races were created during the sundering
[2:16:28] <+Double_Tap_That> I love that the reason they info dump on you is because they think you're a child. It's simple but so good
[2:16:29] <$Yakobro> frames?
[2:16:32] <glitchedmatt1> anyone getting lag?
[2:16:37] <TsundereFFXIV> mini F

[2:16:46] <Thalchampz> yup
[2:16:47] <%Lithdoran> I think it's twitch
[2:16:51] <%VioletHeart> It was hitching for everyone by the sounds of it.

[2:17:48] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@koolaid_kevster) (warning)
[2:17:49] <+Gruntini> tall boi

[2:18:02] <+Estuko> Also I've been playing FF14, it's quite fun! I'm just trying to figure out how to lock onto players with the controller so I can heaaaalll
[2:18:04] <Thalchampz> it's twitch
[2:18:06] <BunnyEmperor> nope for me too
[2:18:08] <cizal11> this vendors feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. just has normal stuff when it should have the weirdest ever shit
[2:18:10] <Thalchampz> twitch is being fucky
[2:18:13] <%Lapinelis> Dropping a few frames but nothing more
[2:18:14] <%Lithdoran> yeah, stream's hiccuping a little
[2:18:25] <%poker4121> @Estuko dpad my dude
[2:18:28] <Thalchampz> unless pat is dropping frames, but i don't think so
