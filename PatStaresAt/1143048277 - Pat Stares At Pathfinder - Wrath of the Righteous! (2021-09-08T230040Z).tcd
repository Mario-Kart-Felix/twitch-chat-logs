[0:00:08] <@Ranryu692> Aw yeah we in it
[0:00:35] <Orenjevel> Oooo its that thing I like, big hype
[0:01:06] <cheapdoc> This stream is gonna have so many goblins, and not the slaying type
[0:01:09] <%XzileGaming> HYPE
[0:01:20] <%lucky_icarus> Oh boy, time for mind hobgoblins!
[0:01:24] <%pokefan9956> be sure to remind pat that seagulls exist
[0:01:31] <%pokefan9956> caw at him if you feel like it
[0:01:36] <cheapdoc> Mind ORCS
[0:01:39] <%Afterman_> i have waited so long for pat to try a pathfinder game
[0:01:39] <%sandrews> oh boy
[0:01:41] <+trackles_64> Hi pat
[0:01:43] <%Afterman_> i kept bugging him about kingmaker
[0:01:55] <Orenjevel> I am devastated goblins weren't a playable ancestry in this crpg, they're really important to Golarion lore
[0:02:02] <@GeneralSCPatton> Mind Goblins -> Spirit Orcs -> Soul Trolls
[0:02:06] <%IonVaporStudios> IonVaporStudios subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Two years! Thanks for being entertaining!
[0:02:08] <%lucky_icarus> Kingmaker is fun, I just wish I can commit to a build to play through it.
[0:02:10] <%Afterman_> ye but we get cool fox ppl
[0:02:26] <Orenjevel> At the terrible cost of not getting rat mans...
[0:02:29] <Afterman_> @lucky_icarus  knife master is stupid fun even with no multiclasasing
[0:02:39] <joodatious> ayyy im here for the start of the stream hey everybody
[0:02:45] <Orenjevel> The kitsune companion is absolutely worth it in the end tho
[0:02:51] <@GeneralSCPatton> Does this one have a time limit like Kingmaker did?
[0:03:04] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! wooooooooooooo, super long wow. also this game has a realllllly long wide up\
[0:03:05] <@Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! Hey Pat, sorry for bringing up bad memories but I just finished a rewatch of the old Omikron LP. Holy shit, what an awful game, you were champions for finishing it. What was going through your mind the moment you hit credits?
[0:03:05] <cheapdoc> Honestly, multiclassing overheats veterans, that'd be like a lot
[0:03:06] <CappuccinoGuil> so is Pat like, gonna play a TTRPG or what? What is this?
[0:03:10] <%YakumoYomi> I wonder how long he spent in character creation. There's A LOT of stuff to pick from. I spent a few hours there myself.
[0:03:14] <%Afterman_> @GeneralSCPatton i think there are certain timed events, and some quests expire after a chapter
[0:03:16] <jorniev> HEEEEEY
[0:03:20] <Sharpevil> @GeneralSCPatton I don't think so. At least, not as a major plot point.
[0:03:23] <JobbedBone> pat, play Bloon's Tower Defense 6 D:
[0:03:28] <jorniev> what game is this?
[0:03:33] <cheapdoc> @YakumoYomi I imagine it's gonna be the whole stream
[0:03:36] <%Afterman_> pathfinder wotr
[0:03:37] <Sharpevil> But I'm just going off of what i know of the original adventure path
[0:03:50] <Sharpevil> I only played a few sessions of the tabletop ver of Wrath of the Righteous
[0:04:11] <dybia> I was delighted to recreate my Pathfinder 2e character in this. Halfling Cavalier Order of the Paw. Disrespect the small people and me and my dog I ride will fuck you up.
[0:04:25] <jorniev> oOoOO pathfinder. is it good?
[0:04:31] <%sandrews> Can you be robot in this?
[0:04:36] <$Order_of_Mystery> oh wow he's playing it
[0:04:39] <cheapdoc> @Sharpevil They might've added it to the game tho. I don't know, haven't gotten super far in yet
[0:04:47] <Sharpevil> If you enjoy crunchy, rules-heavy RPGs, Pathfinder 1st Edition is for you.
[0:04:47] <%crazyspartan214> here we go again
[0:04:55] <%lucky_icarus> @afterman_ Yeah, I heard. I'm looking at that or stick with my pure Paladin.
[0:05:02] <cheapdoc> In B4 Pat gets a stroke on stream
[0:05:07] <Orenjevel> @jorniev I've enjoyed my time with this one (up until I missed a critical item for an optional mythic path and had to go restart a whole dungeon)
[0:05:07] <wolverinewaswrong> is this song from something?
[0:05:12] <@GeneralSCPatton> I would kill for an official Pathfinder CRPG that included the Psionics content from DreamScarred Press.
[0:05:27] <%Mathochism> PATFINDER STREAM
[0:05:32] <%greasypete00> SourPls
[0:05:33] <+transporterthesequel> PAT
[0:05:40] <dybia> There's an npc that lets you respec later so its fine to try out builds
[0:05:44] <Sharpevil> Personally, I like their Path of War stuff best. Though with a competent group, it really does unbalance campaigns.
[0:05:45] <%Afterman_> @lucky_icarus the only complaint i have about knife masters have to do more with the game than their class, you can't throw your regular equipped knives :(
[0:05:46] <%Fooguwu> @wolverinewaswrong nope, all original
[0:05:46] <%DovaDude29> Ngl, I like the previous intro more. Simple and clean etc
[0:05:48] <+hoenhime344> new intro
[0:05:53] <cheapdoc> @GeneralSCPatton Rpg adaptations are kind of scared of psionics in general, ain't they?
[0:06:03] <%YakumoYomi> Is there ANY CRPG (D&D or Pathfinder) that includes psionics? It seems like we always have to turn to mods for that
[0:06:04] <+transporterthesequel> I hAve been obsessed with this game, I cannot miss this.
[0:06:05] <+hoenhime344> theres just too much lore in this intro
[0:06:09] <mattynezz> Cheer500 hey pat, I know that I don't pay your sub, but a good way to get acquainted with the rules and skills of your characters is to play at least a few battles in turn based mode. you can switch it on with the Rook button down in the lower left, and increase animation speeds in the options
[0:06:11] <+radda343> Can't wait for the mind goblins to take this stream over
[0:06:12] <Sharpevil> My pathfinder group finished War for the Crown the other month, and by the end I had to seriously turn up the difficulty.

[0:06:45] <JobbedBone> this opening like a season of sword art online
[0:06:47] <$Order_of_Mystery> the vore in the intro is an interesting touch
[0:06:48] <%pokefan9956> @PatStaresAt , reminder that seagulls exist
[0:06:48] <%BoxNavy> hi pat :)
[0:06:49] <Sharpevil> @GeneralSCPatton Yeah, but specifically, those psionics are from a 3rd party publisher.
[0:06:49] <%doctordinkus> Pat blue da ba dee da ba dye
[0:06:50] <%lucky_icarus> @afterman_ Ah, thats a shame.

[0:07:06] <%NitronStreams> Yeah good start
[0:07:11] <%TDotGoat> making room for giant skelly?
[0:07:12] <%doctordinkus> it balances the frame
[0:07:14] <Sharpevil> I didn't even know you COULD clone cat towers

[0:08:56] <Sharpevil> I played a lot of Kingmaker, and I feel like it'd be a nightmare to play on consoles.
[0:09:06] <Sharpevil> Don't know if this one would work better
[0:09:22] <joodatious> make sure to check out divinity original sin 1 and 2 they are amazing and have great console ports
[0:09:34] <%lucky_icarus> It plays pretty well on console tbh.

[0:20:30] <$zyberion626> @PatStaresAt if it makes you feel better you get 3 free respecs after you clear the tutorial, and you can pay for more later
[0:20:35] <cheapdoc> It is early
[0:20:37] <%redthebaron> do you have any character idea for this or are we going in blind, @PatStaresAt?
[0:20:37] <$CasualSleepyGamer> Do I hear a snoring Geif?
[0:20:43] <%chance_h> Good luck pat, our mind goblins are similar and pathfinder hurts me
[0:20:46] <%YakumoYomi> Oh yeah, Pathfinder games are notorious for being buggy
[0:20:47] <Orenjevel> Big hype for reading out class and archetype descriptions
[0:20:52] <%strugglepunk2> Oh yeah that respec guy is a fucking godsend
[0:20:54] <%GarbageNirvana> As long as it's better than Kingmaker
[0:20:56] <+Shonen_hero> yeah he's in the very first part of the game too
[0:20:59] <%hewlettfan96> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:21:01] <+Shonen_hero> Hilur's cool
[0:21:01] <Sharpevil> Sweet, there's a respec? Now Pat can panic about character creation TWICE!
[0:21:03] <+pectusumbra> @LittleCinders That pat will freak out during character creator
[0:21:03] <DSD24> Pathfinder Kingmaker is pretty good
[0:21:03] <+TheRealSalmonDinner> Kingmaker ended up alright
[0:21:03] <heartlesshealer> he baby
[0:21:04] <+DerivedKnight> Yeah, as someone who plays the Pathfinder TTRPG system myself I can understand that paralysis of choice. We got you homie.
[0:21:05] <dizimous> Oh thank fucking God, I had to install a respec mod in Kingmaker to stay sane
[0:21:07] <+skeletonmilk> pat what is the best dps irl frog

[0:21:14] <%Broand> Kingmaker got a good mandalore review
[0:21:16] <count_bob> kingmaker isn't great.
[0:21:17] <dizimous> Kingmaker is great, p buggy unfortunately
[0:21:17] <Sharpevil> Kingmaker is a lot of fun
[0:21:17] <Lefanque> Kingmaker is real good
[0:21:18] <+Shonen_hero> but it is a little jank
[0:21:18] <+Pendragwn> It's fine
[0:21:19] <%redthebaron> kingmaker is great but the kingdom management drives me insane
[0:21:20] <%strugglepunk2> Kingmaker is fun but also like... crpg slav jank
[0:21:23] <+DerivedKnight> Kingmaker had many issues that got fixed in the final edition.

[0:21:26] <%AncelDeLambert> A-10 Warthog
[0:21:27] <kingdinkyI> Kingmaker ended up good cause they supported the game after
[0:21:27] <%pokefan9956> gun

[0:21:40] <%Cerabret100> I can't judge the character creation struggle, every Grim Dawn or Last Epoch character i make is paralyzed by choice
[0:21:40] <%Afterman_> hippo isnt dps, its one hit kill

[0:21:46] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt You are correct, Malaria has killed more humans than any other source.

[0:21:50] <CappuccinoGuil> a nuke
[0:21:50] <penitentpendant> Nuke is probably the best "Burst Damage"
[0:21:53] <Orenjevel> that is incredibly *low* dps

[0:22:01] <$Order_of_Mystery> hippo, as others said
[0:22:01] <joodatious> Malaria kills the most people by far
[0:22:01] <DSD24> Malaria was a asshole in Far Cry 2
[0:22:02] <%AncelDeLambert> only if the DOT stacks
[0:22:02] <Nordguy> covid-19 is up there

[0:22:05] <supergoblinpunch> Age
[0:22:06] <%AllenDeadman> Entropy is a strong one
[0:22:06] <+MisterAvry> what are those planes that go BRRRT? That gunner is the highest DPS

[0:22:11] <%Bailey__gaming> Hippos are p good dps too
[0:22:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Condition builds ramp up over time and have higher sustained dps
[0:22:12] <@GeneralSCPatton> Kingmaker has some time-based goblins that may require a mod to lock the date.

[0:22:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Or at least that's how I feel
[0:22:37] <penitentpendant> @InvertableQuasar The big question is how much does 'burst' weigh on the equaition versus sustain

[0:27:13] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[0:27:14] <butthurtdave> I used a mod for Kingmaker that got rid of Vancian casting and it make it so much more enjoyable

[0:27:18] <%BoxNavy> "Oh"
[0:27:19] <+DeadPhoenix3> you didn't play kingmaker at all?
[0:27:19] <%redthebaron> THIS WILL BE THE BEST

[0:27:25] <+BedHome> superman made this game
[0:27:26] <%Nekros4442> so the who stream will be character creation
[0:27:26] <heartlesshealer> Is it Pathfinder 1E or 2E character creator?
[0:27:27] <JobbedBone> lifespan decreased
[0:27:28] <AthenaAegis> Poisoned glass covered in mold and pineapple juice Kappa
[0:27:28] <%chance_h> THAT IT? OH NO
[0:27:28] <+Shonen_hero> Oh but it's so good though, so many options.
[0:27:28] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Pat have you ever looked at the character sheet for Shadowrun?
[0:27:30] <ValentineWolf7> Sick, we're in for a wild stream
[0:27:32] <+Pendragwn> OH NO
[0:27:33] <joodatious> pat dont let anyone trick you into thinking you should play 3.5 if you ever do DND
[0:27:33] <+McSoliace> your brain is gonna die
[0:27:34] <%walternatorz> a rewatch??
[0:27:35] <+transporterthesequel> gonna be that kinda stream
[0:27:35] <austinj24> Oh u sweet summer goblin
[0:27:37] <%komradedog> TURN BASED MODE WILL BE YOUR FRIEND
[0:27:37] <%RealThiele> JUST TAKE TOUGHNESS A LOT
[0:27:38] <+Pendragwn> @heartlesshealer I think it's still 1E
[0:27:39] <$CasualSleepyGamer> So is this Pathfinder farely new?
[0:27:43] <%ComfortableStranger> i remember that LP
[0:27:44] <vVAstrAVv> character creator stream. we got it lol
[0:27:46] <BliVru> Absolute Dispair
[0:27:49] <%Piemono> You might want to look at a class guide
[0:27:54] <sendart> Nice
[0:27:56] <heartlesshealer> @heartlesshealer Dang, but also understandable
[0:28:01] <+fetrigon> @casualsleepygamer just came out
[0:28:04] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:28:05] <+transporterthesequel> Bro I don’t have Goblins. Pathfinder has given me goblins.
[0:28:06] <+Bluemanzee> @CasualSleepyGamer Came out a few days ago
[0:28:06] <%redthebaron> i was going insane at the character creator and i generally am not the type to do that
[0:28:07] <%ComfortableStranger> the Woolie vs pat argument was golden
[0:28:11] <kingdinkyI> no the class guides will make you go insane
[0:28:12] <joodatious> Pat did you see that Witcher animated movie? I just watched it and the ending is awful garbage
[0:28:16] <%doomunderthestairs> that one stage the door and that first person shoot boss
[0:28:20] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[0:28:21] <austinj24> Meshkan
[0:28:21] <+nicoleymcquack> i don’t even think I finished watching it tbh it’s was like 500 parts and i didn’t have it in me
[0:28:22] <%AncelDeLambert> I love you mentioning Woolie's face when you got the game working again after one problem
[0:28:22] <@Lion_kun> The Tetra factory bug
[0:28:27] <ozmodek> @patstaresat for a beginner I highly recommend play a straightforward class. Pathfinder can get incredibly complicated.
[0:28:27] <ValentineWolf7> Oh no Woolie
[0:28:29] <%cvp5127> spoilers LUL
[0:28:29] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt also that death bug
[0:28:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> THAT FUCKING DOOR
[0:28:30] <%deviljhojho_> now THATS funny
[0:28:32] <professorbadvibes> Big think dimension?
[0:28:33] <%HollowedIdjit> Pathfinder is Option Paralysis in physical form.
[0:28:34] <%chiazam> When they got lost
[0:28:35] <Siiegwynn> nice gamer shirt, gamer
[0:28:35] <Tracazoid> Woolie tips were the best
[0:28:36] <%greasypete00> LUL
[0:28:37] <SaltyAzteca> WE ARE ALL FREE NOW.
[0:28:39] <%Mattais88> Wasn't that the fps demon?
[0:28:40] <%ComfortableStranger> to this day Woolie believes he did no wrong!
[0:28:43] <+Pendragwn> @joodatious Never play 3.5, just play Pathfinder for a cleaned up version of it.
[0:28:43] <+radda343> why did you put woolie in charge of navigation
[0:28:44] <AzureGale> snuffOmegalul
[0:28:45] <@Ranryu692> remember when you thought you couldn't save anymore
[0:28:48] <%DianaTheAscian> THAT DOOR
[0:28:49] <meteor530> Makes sense since Woolie has 20/20 vision right>
[0:28:55] <%RealThiele> you cant beat me! i quit!
[0:28:57] <%DianaTheAscian> WOOILE WAS WRONG
[0:28:57] <%hewlettfan96> THE DOORS
[0:29:03] <%Monkeyweed21> the game crashed on the final boss multiple times
[0:29:05] <Myrkbat> HEY CHAT MEMBERS! PLAY PATHFINDER 2E! IT FUCKING SLAPS!
[0:29:06] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:29:07] <@ssjklyco> Old guy?
[0:29:07] <+MisterAvry> Woolie has the best 3 sets of eyes
[0:29:08] <cheapdoc> Pathfinder is just like KOTOR but with regular wizards instead of space wizards
[0:29:09] <%Cerabret100> So he's gonna end up being a serial killer right?
[0:29:10] <%Treuan> Nice
[0:29:11] <intestinal_bleeding> friendly neighbors?
[0:29:13] <ValentineWolf7> What an OG
[0:29:15] <+nicoleymcquack> bless woolie
[0:29:15] <intestinal_bleeding> oh my god I wish I knew what that was like
[0:29:19] <+InvertableQuasar> I've played a bunch of tabletop pathfinder, I can't even imagine a character creator being even kind of useful if you haven't read the books. So this will be fun
[0:29:21] <heartlesshealer> Oh wow, a good new neighbor is a unicorn
[0:29:21] <JobbedBone> peepoHappy bake him something
[0:29:23] <%sw_paladin> Turns out hes Superman
[0:29:25] <%stantheman_97> are they and zangief friends?
[0:29:26] <AzureGale> veiLUL
[0:29:27] <%alphonseisbest> you ever finish Baldur's Gate 1 or 2?
[0:29:32] <+MisterAvry> Pathfinder is Legally Distinct D&D
[0:29:33] <%hewlettfan96> Thats good
[0:29:35] <DSD24> I mean you can be a Sword Saint in this game
[0:29:42] <+Shonen_hero> yes
[0:29:45] <penitentpendant> Praise the Turn Base!
[0:29:47] <+Dotta5> Leaving some brown kryptonite in his mailbox are we?
[0:29:51] <+InvertableQuasar> That seems like good advice to me
[0:29:52] <%Nekros4442> yes you can play the entire game in turnbased
[0:29:53] <%komradedog> ITS VERY GOOD MODE
[0:29:54] <+BedHome> yeah thats a good suggestion
[0:29:56] <DSD24> Yeah you can swap between the two
[0:29:57] <%moonmintparadise> kinda like baldurs gate
[0:29:59] <+Shonen_hero> you can switch it on and off even in combat
[0:29:59] <%RealThiele> based
[0:30:00] <%Kaask> is this another cool game i'm going to have to buy and never play
[0:30:01] <cheapdoc> You'll be more than fine
[0:30:01] <butthurtdave> Yeah it's a lot more fun turn based since it doesn't have a toggleable speed thing like PoE
[0:30:03] <%Kyma1020> you can switch back and forth in game unlike Pillars 2
[0:30:03] <+TheRealSalmonDinner> Oh we're fine then
[0:30:04] <dyllustrate> What about bg1.5
[0:30:05] <%ComfortableStranger> back when bioware didn't suck
[0:30:09] <%ahomeschooldropout> I like how Mandalore referred to Pathfinder as "Catholic D&D"
[0:30:11] <digaogrunge> ONLY turn based for me
[0:30:14] <%Kemmybelle> Bake him a pie.
[0:30:14] <%Broand> playing DND games outside of turn based mode feels ill advised personally
[0:30:15] <+Shonen_hero> and I recommend turning turn based off during huge trash encounters
[0:30:15] <heartlesshealer> Baby approach!
[0:30:17] <+goblinking92> Did he steam BD1 and 2?
[0:30:18] <%Cerabret100> never finished BG1, me and real time DnD games don't mix no matter how much i try
[0:30:18] <+InvertableQuasar> When I played Kingmaker I used Turn Based a lot of the time and then went to realtime for easy battles and cleanup
[0:30:22] <%redthebaron> super poop
[0:30:23] <%Monkeyweed21> what about BG 2.0+1.0
[0:30:27] <%rekinom> Hey Pat nice beard trim lookin' good :D
[0:30:31] <Reilata> Mmm BG2. Minsc and Boo, together again.
[0:30:32] <+Shonen_hero> super dump
[0:30:36] <%ComfortableStranger> @ahomeschooldropout filled with guilt and shame?
[0:30:38] <$CasualSleepyGamer> Pooper Man
[0:30:40] <%Kyma1020> Catholic D&D? oh god I can see it
[0:30:44] <rustybuckethead21> I will always remember when, after learning that "tips wasted saves", one of you threatened to get another tip at the next save out of the sewer (the one full of vents) level, and woolie almost lost it. That LP is a thing for history.
[0:30:45] <signofzeta> i honestly don't get why people get so mad over pat's hatred of superman
[0:30:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Joke's on you, I'm already a loser
[0:30:47] <%Giantsuperguy> I mostly play turn based cause I find playing casters, and especially magus, in rtwp to be absolutely awful
[0:30:47] <%Broand> Pat isn't lex luthor, he's the joker, as soon as you play by his rules, you've lost
[0:30:48] <%chance_h> Super baby
[0:30:50] <%megadblitz> dammit im thinking about it does that mean i've lost?
[0:30:50] <kingdinkyI> turn-based can be a bit buggy  when it comes to ending battles
[0:30:50] <%hewlettfan96> giant dump
[0:30:50] <%SaiyanShoto> If you reply to Pat you already lost
[0:30:50] <%sandrews> No problem
[0:30:53] <%YakumoYomi> Go for the eyes, Boo. GO FOR THE EYES!
[0:30:54] <%chiazam> Fuck that
[0:30:55] <%Drarrk> Need more games where you can play as a Goblin! Elves a shit, gib the gobbo
[0:30:56] <%HollowedIdjit> I mean we have that one Batman comic where Bats DID poop his pants
[0:31:00] <+transporterthesequel> Pat I have really bad news. You have to choose a class. THEN you have to choose ANOTHER, SUPER HYPER CLASS.
[0:31:05] <%RealThiele> BG1 you can just cheat by making a MP character, give all the stuff to one guy, then play that guy on SP
[0:31:06] <%Bailey__gaming> can superman poop in a regular toilet or does he expell poop at super speed?
[0:31:08] <+McSoliace> super ass dump
[0:31:11] <freehandoubts> pat what the fuck, truly. Ive been watching you since I was 12 on machinema this is my first stream I feel like im finding a long lost family member

[0:31:18] <%redthebaron> it is gonna be really intense pat i fell it
[0:31:22] <$realm_forge> If Superman got diarrhea could he carve a trench in the earth’s crust from the sheer force?

[0:34:51] <%peyodogo> beard trim looks alright
[0:34:52] <%Cerabret100> I promise to not help at all because i have none to offer
[0:34:52] <orphancrippler_> the goblins intensify
[0:34:54] <%darklordfodder> Tip 1 be a caster
[0:34:56] <digaogrunge> CHAT IS GOOD AT CRPGS
[0:34:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> I feel like this will be a Pillars 2 situation where Pat drops the game saying he'll play it again when the DLCs drop but then never touches it again.
[0:35:01] <Manwad> Greatsword fighter all day every day
[0:35:03] <%darklordfodder> Tip 2 don't not be a caster
[0:35:03] <+DerivedKnight> @PatStaresAt Hey, we got you! Just let us know what you're trying to build and we'll help you Min/Max the fuck out of it.
[0:35:03] <%HollowedIdjit> The Paladin from my last campaign was bumping up against 66 AC. Nothing our DM could throw outside of some Homebrew stuff could hit him.
[0:35:04] <%jtdobyns> LUCKY TED build?
[0:35:06] <%DianaTheAscian> no clue what this game is so I'll just yell fake advice
[0:35:07] <+MisterAvry> do magics
[0:35:09] <%RealThiele> Druid, Cleric, Wizard/Sorcerer are the best characters
[0:35:10] <%DovaDude29> Server just took a lag dip? Anyone else?
[0:35:11] <%Piemono> Alchemist is pretty decent
[0:35:11] <%Bailey__gaming> ALL IN LUCK & CHARISMA
[0:35:14] <+PenmanLupine> he's never gonna do em
[0:35:14] <%darklordfodder> Tip 3 survive the first 4 levels
[0:35:16] <DSD24> He would like ME2
[0:35:17] <pacibuddy> rangers are really cool in this game
[0:35:23] <+MisterAvry> devil magics!
[0:35:26] <DSD24> Barbarian is another good beginner class
[0:35:30] <%DovaDude29> I fucked up I meant signal psaLiz
[0:35:31] <DSD24> Big Number
[0:35:34] <JobbedBone> is this like disco elysium but for ACTUAL nerds?
[0:35:41] <$CasualSleepyGamer> Hi Zero Drop
[0:35:42] <quantras6> @patstaresat it's worth knowing that Pathfinder let's you respec, with the first 3 ones free. It's the same guy who lets you make mercenaries.
[0:35:44] <%alphonseisbest> Woolie COULD'VE saved Bioware LUL
[0:35:50] <%CodyKnowsNothing> Boy did he luck out
[0:35:53] <cheapdoc> it's still pretty girthy
[0:35:59] <signofzeta> i'm so mad that swashbuckler isn't in the game
[0:35:59] <%Broand> oh interesting
[0:35:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> Nukie Tip 1: Don't play a ranged character. You're getting a lot of ranged party members first.
[0:35:59] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt 3.5 and pathfinder have the most options DnD have ever had ever
[0:36:01] <+InvertableQuasar> Yeah, looks like they added some classes at least
[0:36:03] <%RealThiele> theres like 7 books just for starting character options in pathfinder
[0:36:05] <%Ghufufin> kingmaker has DLC and mods to add more
[0:36:08] <Dellago> They even made new race specific subclasses just for the game
[0:36:08] <quantras6> @jobbedbone it's knock off3.5 DND basically
[0:36:09] <digaogrunge> I hope you like FEATS
[0:36:11] <+DeadPhoenix3> i love all the options in pathfinder. kinda the lack of choices is my chief complaint about 5e
[0:36:12] <cheapdoc> Smooch EVERYONE
[0:36:13] <%strugglepunk2> oh yeah that one is a mistake
[0:36:14] <%Theycallmenerf> What’s Pathfinder, a dungeon crawler?
[0:36:14] <intestinal_bleeding> I hope there are hot goblin girls in pathfinder
[0:36:17] <Sharpevil> If the option paralysis is too much, you can always just make a big dumb thumpy barbarian. Big strength, big constitution, big thumpy stick.
[0:36:18] <%HollowedIdjit> yeah WOTR has 25 Classes and that's still not all of them from the Tabletop
[0:36:19] <%jtdobyns> For me I know when low latency mode is turned on... Twitch freaks out. So i prefer to turn it off
[0:36:19] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah you 100% can never include all the options of D&D games
[0:36:22] <+BedHome> paige is basically an elf
[0:36:23] <retrobanner> Absolutely smooch the other sexy elf.
[0:36:23] <+MisterAvry> Shout out to the Glass Cannon Podcast for a fun Pathfinder playthrough, by the way.
[0:36:23] <omegadarknes> smooch only the ugly elf
[0:36:31] <+nicoleymcquack> there’s a sexy elf? uwu
[0:36:32] <+Pendragwn> @HollowedIdjit I made a multiclass that was hitting like 60 AC by level 12... I had to rebalance it DOWN TO THAT POINT to add damage because my bullshit was out of this world
[0:36:35] <%Ghufufin> a pellow?
[0:36:35] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah she’ll try don’t do it.
[0:36:36] <+Mrbaconator> WOTR adds mythic stuff too
[0:36:38] <+FanServ> cocaine pillow
[0:36:38] <Dellago> No Goblins at all sadly. Thats one negative
[0:36:38] <%sw_paladin> Smooch the succubus
[0:36:41] <quantras6> @hollowedidjit and every class that isn't a prestige one has 6 fucking subclasses
[0:36:43] <%RealThiele> paige is changeling
[0:36:44] <$zyberion626> Pathfinder was created literally because DnD was getting rid of min-maxing bullshit systems. It's the king of crunch, it's great!
[0:36:45] <$CasualSleepyGamer> They heard you were tired
[0:36:46] <%DianaTheAscian> are there ugly elves?
[0:36:46] <Profmcstevie> Get rid of it, it's GOTTA be compromised
[0:36:48] <%chiazam> Drugs?
[0:36:49] <%RealThiele> short lived and part hag
[0:36:54] <+andreeg24> any idea on what you're char concept is?
[0:36:54] <heartlesshealer> a snare for basic elf-lovers, you say?
[0:36:55] <%Puhff> Pathfinder is an off Tabletop Game based on Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition, chat
[0:36:56] <+fetrigon> smallpox pillow monkaS
[0:36:58] <+BedHome> you cant include all the options of pathfinder or dnd because the MAIN option is "MAKE UP YOUR OWN SHIT"
[0:36:59] <BigYanno> video games can't ever really emulate tabletop RPG's ability to just make shit up on the fly
[0:36:59] <+transporterthesequel> OH GOD DONT TELL PAT ABOUT THE MYTHIC PATH STUFF
[0:37:00] <%moonmintparadise> clean it and give it to the dog
[0:37:05] <orphancrippler_> the penis slider can't go low enough for me to make my self insert character 3/10  bad game
[0:37:18] <%Bailey__gaming> paige breaking the world
[0:37:20] <%kullumanati> Will we have to worry about Landgulls this episode?
[0:37:23] <Profmcstevie> Finish a sentence damn

[0:39:37] <%Cerabret100> @BedHome she hasn't hunted a damn thing in her life, also i'd imagine hissing would give away the game

[0:39:45] <%Piemono> That's not very far for him
[0:39:46] <+nicoleymcquack> mmmm yummy
[0:39:47] <%alphonseisbest> ew
[0:39:47] <%Puhff> You want it
[0:39:54] <+Pendragwn> @HollowedIdjit It was a kitsune swashbuckler monk paladin rogue fighter brawler for PFS. They didn't like me since I could charge and full attack while being untouchable lol
[0:39:55] <heartlesshealer> that's when you wipe the dog face
[0:39:56] <$CasualSleepyGamer> time to clean the stinky'
[0:39:56] <%RealThiele> drool chain +1
[0:40:00] <%Gogogolem> Pat are you using custome portraits?
[0:40:03] <+nicoleymcquack> love stinky goo dog
[0:40:09] <quantras6> @dsd24 I know I need to do a tiefling trickster with that smug bastard Daeran for sure, but right now I'm going a lawful neutral Dhampir
[0:40:21] <DSD24> Custom Portraits are good in this game
[0:40:22] <%AncelDeLambert> that's nice, none of that translates to a CRPG
[0:40:23] <dizimous> "I like 5e better" CRINGE, but valid
[0:40:26] <$realm_forge> Rename Zangeif to Ivan Ooze
[0:40:30] <+Hollow_Mirage> First one was hit or miss for me; just was too heavily stacking the enemies HP and AC
[0:40:32] <heartlesshealer> six classes is extremely homebrew
[0:40:35] <DSD24> Full Lenght Medium Small
[0:40:45] <%space_penguin> wtf?
[0:40:49] <%RealThiele> 3.5e is insane for new people or someone that wants to start a session quickly
[0:41:03] <quantras6> Does Pat even know about Wrath's mythic paths?
[0:41:04] <+BedHome> @RealThiele not with a decent dm
[0:41:05] <DSD24> Thankfully there is a Portrait Generator
[0:41:08] <%deviljhojho_> it is tho
[0:41:09] <DSD24> On the Internet
[0:41:10] <+FanServ> @space_penguin because in some places you see the full character
[0:41:12] <+MisterAvry> agree
[0:41:13] <+BedHome> unfortunatly no dm here
[0:41:14] <orphancrippler_> pat has good head
[0:41:15] <+nicoleymcquack> NO
[0:41:16] <Dlent_> I hope they use PF2E rules for a CRPG at some point. It’s very well suited to a video game.
[0:41:17] <%Drarrk> embrace goblins
[0:41:19] <%CopperTucker> 5e is way easier on people like me who can't do math.
[0:41:23] <%BoxNavy> nah
[0:41:24] <+TheAdMerlin> Pat dumped Will for more Con
[0:41:25] <%AncelDeLambert> speaking of twitter discourse, if you're gonna swing at SkillUp you better bring your A game
[0:41:25] <+DerivedKnight> @Hollow_Mirage Yeah there's Pathfinder alright
[0:41:26] <cheapdoc> Honestly, if you get past this first stream, the goblins will be slain
[0:41:35] <+DeadPhoenix3> Drawback: Auto fail all goblin will saves
[0:41:36] <%alphonseisbest> not this shit again pls
[0:41:37] <%CopperTucker> started with 3.5 and playtested PF at Gencon. I like 5e better
[0:41:39] <heartlesshealer> stop trying to get Pat on Mythic Paths at level 1
[0:41:46] <%deviljhojho_> was there a male orc barbarian portrait in the last pathfinder game? I recall being mildly miffed about not finding one
[0:41:48] <+BedHome> honestly neither pathfinder or dnd are that great, but they are good enough if you arent gonna devote a lotta time to ttrpgs
[0:41:48] <%ComfortableStranger> thnikkaman
[0:41:49] <%BoxNavy> he lives with you now
[0:41:49] <%shurtal> ???
[0:41:50] <BigYanno> is pat some kind of ginger goblin?
[0:41:50] <JobbedBone> bunger bunger bunger
[0:41:51] <$CasualSleepyGamer> How can you resist goblins when you are one?
[0:41:55] <Reilata> I started off with 3.5 and had no idea what was going on for a while, but once the information broke through it was great.
[0:41:56] <%alphonseisbest> @AncelDeLambert what happened with Skill up?
[0:41:57] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Pekora Reference?
[0:41:57] <%RealThiele> bunger bunger bunger
[0:41:58] <huskarl_zap> bungerbungerbunger
[0:41:59] <%DoubleRrico> it seems to be a refrence of some kind
[0:42:01] <%GarbageNirvana> I think that's a Pekora thing
[0:42:05] <butthurtdave> Have you decided on a starting class Pat?
[0:42:10] <%Mattais88> It really is
[0:42:14] <%deviljhojho_> hew it
[0:42:17] <Treasure_Vault> Fate is just like Destiny, in that it's something that I don't care about
[0:42:19] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah if you get past the character creator boss, you’ll be hooked(doomed) forever.
[0:42:19] <%alphonseisbest> yup
[0:42:21] <%TheDullaMAN> I made a poor choice for my message this month.
[0:42:23] <+RelikaNox> I'm finally gonna get to play D&D again soon after many, many years, and was excited because 5e sounded a lot easier, and apparently the DM wants to do 3.5e :(
[0:42:24] <%deviljhojho_> whats a pekora
[0:42:24] <%HollowedIdjit> @hollow_mirage admittedly that's what I love, but I getcha
[0:42:25] <%hewlettfan96> its jamie hewlett look him up
[0:42:25] <@Ranryu692> Oh no
[0:42:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> hyooit
[0:42:33] <%darklordfodder> Basically when I try to go back to Pathfinder I'm like "Fuck that's right,  that's still a thing in this edition" every 20 minutes.
[0:42:34] <%RealThiele> Mr. Packard
[0:42:38] <%Monkeyweed21> just read the 100 hour long VN /s
[0:42:39] <DSD24> @deviljhojho_ There was a Lady Barbarian Portrait but I think there is a Male One

[0:42:49] <%RealThiele> Communist supes
[0:42:50] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:42:50] <@ssjklyco> You're half right on that
[0:42:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Lex Luthor is a billionaire, tho
[0:42:51] <signofzeta> surely, that would happen
[0:42:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @alphonseisbest some UK rag published a dumbass piece by a TERF shitting on videogames and SU pointed out that the writer mostly does "Royals" tabloid shit and she tried and failed to clap back
[0:42:55] <$lotharrio> Yeah, that's Red Son.
[0:42:57] <CappuccinoGuil> And billionaires are fucking evil
[0:42:57] <%pokefan9956> dont take the bait
[0:42:58] <%deviljhojho_> @DSD24 hmmm maybe i wasn't paying enough attention
[0:42:58] <%MugenSandan> Pat why do you simp for Jeff Bezos so
[0:42:58] <+SinisterBroccoli> good take lol
[0:42:59] <+Hollow_Mirage> @Hollow_Mirage Yeah it was fine until a group of wargs all have 8 levels in barbarian and are just impossible to hit.
[0:43:01] <%blue8moon> but isn't that the world we live in tho?
[0:43:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Superman vs the Elite is also really good
[0:43:02] <%walternatorz> couldn't lex have done that without killing superman?
[0:43:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats kinda  Red Son
[0:43:04] <DSD24> Thankfully the Portraits for this game have some really cool ones
[0:43:05] <BliVru> Pat are you JEALOUS of superman?
[0:43:07] <%Birdigalore> Birdigalore subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Looking for new game music to add to my playlist.  Any recommendation for obscure, but good soundtracks?
[0:43:10] <%SpoonheadInExile> Also, he's friends with Stalin, so fuck superman.
[0:43:14] <+BedHome> i think we found lex luthor in this universe he was even origonally a ginger it turns out without superman to compare himself to, lex just turns into pat
[0:43:15] <%pokefan9956> DONT TAKE THE BAIT
[0:43:15] <joodatious> @RelikaNox that sounds like shit. there's no good reason to play 3.5 unless the entire table wants to
[0:43:15] <%deviljhojho_> d-dont worry about it
[0:43:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Spoken like a true billionaire stan
[0:43:17] <%NopeBadguy> oh thank god i thought i was going to miss character creation
[0:43:18] <+transporterthesequel> Then you’ll LOVE Red Son
[0:43:20] <%pokefan9956> STOP TAKING THE BAIT
[0:43:22] <%jtdobyns> The only Superman I liked was in Smallville.
[0:43:23] <%alphonseisbest> @AncelDeLambert OH MAN as a brit i have to go see that!
[0:43:23] <%RealThiele> Lex would get to 99% perfect society and then shit on it cause hes dumb
[0:43:23] <$realm_forge> Suckerman
[0:43:23] <%HollowedIdjit> Lex is like Musk but moderately less awful
[0:43:25] <%DianaTheAscian> what does lex do outside oh hating super man even?
[0:43:25] <%deviljhojho_> "but i dont want to solve world problems, i want to kill superman!"
[0:43:26] <quantras6> You can also just use the portraits from Kingmaker
[0:43:27] <@Ranryu692> Sauron
[0:43:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> But I WANNA kill Superman
[0:43:28] <%Agami23> lex luthor would have just jumped to a different hero. its not actually about superman, its about anyone different that can be seen as better
[0:43:28] <%Ghufufin> the lizard?
[0:43:28] <DSD24> @deviljhojho_ The good news is that you can also use Kingmaker portraits too not just the Righteous ones
[0:43:29] <MrChaosDoughnut> Sauron.
[0:43:31] <TioXyco> superman deserves to die
[0:43:32] <SaltyAzteca> But I wanna create dinosaurs
[0:43:32] <jumpyhugs> Sauron
[0:43:32] <+BedHome> but the bait is SO GOOD man
[0:43:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Any compliment of Lex should ALWAYS be followed with "yeah, but he's a billionaire tho"
[0:43:33] <%shurtal> that dinosaur guy should TOTALLY CURE the cancer
[0:43:33] <GameOver_Here> The Lizard?
[0:43:34] <%pilgrimsayswhat> based Lex Luthor
[0:43:34] <%Meekest> Sauron
[0:43:36] <digaogrunge> 3.x has the crunch. 4e is a tabletop mmo (best dnd combat imo). 5e is streamlined and easy to get into
[0:43:37] <+kewlmyc> BUT IT'S COOL THOUGH
[0:43:40] <BigYanno> I maintain that Elon Musk is one Superman away from being Lex Luthor
[0:43:41] <%walternatorz> fair point
[0:43:43] <+DeadPhoenix3> man hate superman all you want, but lex luthor is a shitty rich kid who is just mad that people like supes
[0:43:43] <Reilata> Seems legit.
[0:43:49] <%DoubleRrico> i'd like to be a dinosaur
[0:43:49] <$CasualSleepyGamer> I don't want to cure cancer! I want to make people into dinosaurs!
[0:43:50] <%VitoXXI> comics are for losers tho
[0:43:53] <mike2hands> I love when the superant comes every once in a while
[0:43:54] <MrChaosDoughnut> I wanna be a dinosaur.
[0:43:56] <%RealThiele> ill become a human intelligence dino sure
[0:43:59] <%deviljhojho_> @DSD24 Oh that's actually real solid, Kingmaker had a lot of cool portraits
[0:43:59] <%The_Death_Owl> I just joined, are we hating on superman? majinoNinjuh
[0:43:59] <%Meekest> Pat: Valid
[0:44:04] <@Ranryu692> Spidey should've let him turn them all into dinosaurs. it could only improve Staten Island
[0:44:04] <+rafaelba93> i can respect that
[0:44:04] <%deviljhojho_> you cant
[0:44:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> The logic is airtight
[0:44:11] <+transporterthesequel> I grabbed a SHITTON of portraits from nexusmods, you can use peoples Kingmaker ones it’s great.
[0:44:11] <%crazyspartan214> dinosaurs are cool
[0:44:15] <GameOver_Here> DISCO ELYSIUM
[0:44:17] <%hewlettfan96> or that bit from spiderman, you can cure cancer but i dont wat to cure cancer i want to turn people into dinosaurs
[0:44:17] <%logoth_> Freedom Planet
[0:44:19] <+BedHome> @BigYanno elon musk sucks too much to be luthor, musk would never let himself go bald for example he would just get shitty looking hair implants and pay people to be nice to him
[0:44:21] <+megaman_sentinel> but why tho
[0:44:25] <%Dakuu75> you tell them "What you want and what you need, aren't the same thing LEX!"
[0:44:25] <jumpyhugs> Dust Force has a great soundtrack
[0:44:28] <JobbedBone> wasted potential is more interesting than infinite potential
[0:44:29] <%deviljhojho_> my ideal world is a planet were new yorkers can only communicate tru saurian screeching
[0:44:31] <%Ynkubus_> Starsiege ost
[0:44:33] <%emperordread> Phoenix Wright and God Hand have slapping OSTs
[0:44:34] <quantras6> @deviljhojho_ I think you can use companion ones as well if you wanted to use say Tristian's portrait.
[0:44:34] <%Birdigalore> Thanks!
[0:44:34] <TheOgreKing> destruction derby soundtrack
[0:44:37] <+Shonen_hero> speaking of dinosaurs
[0:44:40] <+Shonen_hero> pathfinder has those
[0:44:41] <%VitoXXI> the new 2 mello album
[0:44:43] <%DianaTheAscian> Etrian odyssey has a fun ost
[0:44:44] <DSD24> @deviljhojho_ The biggest surprise is that you can use Villain portraits too
[0:44:44] <$CasualSleepyGamer> Pat is actually secretly Ben Aflect Batman
[0:44:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> Neverwinter nights, done by the morrowind dude
[0:44:48] <SaltyAzteca> wow
[0:44:48] <%Birdigalore> lol thanks everyone for recommendations
[0:44:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat In Red Son Lex literally convinces Superman that hes too dangerous to live among humans and he leaves earth and Lex becomes President
[0:44:52] <%chance_h> ChronoCross sound track is pretty pog
[0:44:52] <%RealThiele> Druid of the dinosaur
[0:44:56] <+nicoleymcquack> not enough
[0:44:56] <$lotharrio> 10 million hours, incoming.
[0:44:57] <cheapdoc> This is getting BETTER and BETTER
[0:44:59] <%The_Death_Owl> I think that means you own steam at this point Pat
[0:45:02] <AzureGale> I hjave to use the search on steam lol
[0:45:02] <SaltyAzteca> And I thought my backlog was bad LUL
[0:45:03] <+Shonen_hero> Do you have them broken down into dynamic collections?
[0:45:04] <digaogrunge> @TheOgreKing this guy knows
[0:45:04] <CappuccinoGuil> wait, yo uhave only 190 games?
[0:45:04] <%deviljhojho_> @quantras6 oh man i always wanted to steal the portrait of that one dwarf companion from the first game
[0:45:05] <%HollowedIdjit> @shonen_hero Summon Dinosaurs. Always a classic.
[0:45:06] <%TheDullaMAN> Just have less games
[0:45:06] <BigYanno> damn, I'm only at 572
[0:45:06] <+DerivedKnight> That just reminds me of that weird movie where Lex Luthor almost kills Superman with a Superhuman Serum he has and then gains Superman's ability to see things in such as way as him that his mind just fucking goes 'We are all insignificant in the grand scheme of things'
[0:45:06] <$zyberion626> Iomedae is best goddess FIGHT ME
[0:45:07] <Nordguy> is FURI obscure? cuz that's a banger soundtrack if i ever heard one
[0:45:08] <JobbedBone> I want to like Prey but it keeps crashing BibleThump
[0:45:10] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Jeff Bezos could solve everything but he wants to spend 29 billion on making himself immortal

[0:45:35] <SaltyAzteca> *Halo chanting*
[0:45:35] <BliVru> Oh god did you saw the Sonic Colours glitches?
[0:45:35] <+BeowulfCrusader> Best change
[0:45:37] <%walternatorz> now he can kiss your shoulder everytime you shift in your couch
[0:45:39] <studleydoorite> he looks like he's about to whisper sweet nothings over your shoulder
[0:45:40] <%darklordfodder> Druid is fun
[0:45:41] <%deviljhojho_> smaller
[0:45:42] <+BedHome> jeff bezos is an astronaut larper
[0:45:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Now?
[0:45:42] <+JustToWatch> now?
[0:45:42] <%TheDullaMAN> now?
[0:45:44] <%BoxNavy> Pat Smalls At
[0:45:44] <%Dakuu75> omg, it hasd its own Halo theme
[0:45:44] <DSD24> @deviljhojho_ The Stag Lord? Hell yeah you can!
[0:45:49] <+Shonen_hero> now it's time for the first battle in the game
[0:45:51] <%Ghufufin> hey does anyone know is pat playing turn based or RTS?
[0:45:52] <+transporterthesequel> HERE WE GO BOYS
[0:45:52] <%NopeBadguy> Do you know what character you're building right now?
[0:45:55] <+Shonen_hero> if you can beat this, you've won the game
[0:45:57] <$zyberion626> ???
[0:45:57] <+glgzephyr> not really?
[0:45:58] <DSD24> @deviljhojho_ The Stag Lord had a awesome Portrait
[0:46:04] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt as someone very bad at these games, i eagerly await your big smart brain to show me the way
[0:46:04] <lambishly> are we going good boy or hand wringing evil?
[0:46:06] <quantras6> @dsd24 the Dhampir portrait looks so goddamn good
[0:46:06] <%DianaTheAscian> i also thought of halo music
[0:46:08] <%NitronStreams> the start was halo
[0:46:08] <+transporterthesequel> 8 hour character creation stream lets go
[0:46:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Everthing with chanting men is Halo music
[0:46:12] <+BedHome> @Ghufufin someone advised him to start rts and he said that was a good idea
[0:46:12] <+glgzephyr> it has strings and choir
[0:46:14] <%deviljhojho_> @DSD24 Oh fuck that guy had such a badass portrait. This is actually rather tempting....
[0:46:14] <$CasualSleepyGamer> owlcat sounds like a familiar I want
[0:46:15] <%crazyspartan214> LOTR song?
[0:46:15] <%Ghufufin> dunna dunn
[0:46:15] <%walternatorz> infallible logic
[0:46:15] <+nicoleymcquack> you moved steve so we could see him but he is just a dot now
[0:46:15] <Sharpevil> Whoa. Halo DID also have dudes singing.
[0:46:17] <Vyskus> nailed it
[0:46:18] <%logoth_> Revenge of John Halo
[0:46:18] <%Treuan> The math checks out
[0:46:19] <digaogrunge> HALO is BGish
[0:46:21] <BigYanno> Halo = Gregorian chanting
[0:46:21] <%Puhff> ...because it has a chorus????
[0:46:22] <SaltyAzteca> Ye pretty much, now lets see the John Halo
[0:46:22] <empiricism> i heard of it
[0:46:23] <%shurtal> could be a Souken track
[0:46:23] <%deviljhojho_> OOOOOOO
[0:46:25] <zerointelligence000> john halo is my favorite fortnite
[0:46:25] <lambishly> oooOOOooOo
[0:46:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> They DO do that
[0:46:26] <joodatious> yes pat very good
[0:46:26] <%Dakuu75> oh, I thought this was gonna be that new FPS with portals
[0:46:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow
[0:46:27] <%BoxNavy> whatlo?
[0:46:28] <%bread_assassin> I need to get around to getting back to beating the first game.
[0:46:29] <heartlesshealer> less trumpets but yeah, seems western music-y
[0:46:29] <%DianaTheAscian> think about it
[0:46:29] <%Ynkubus_> Stormblood is Halo now?
[0:46:29] <+Shockrates20XX> Getting big Halo vibes from this game.
[0:46:33] <$zyberion626> the shadowbringers theme is Halo, got it Pat
[0:46:33] <%RealThiele> or a skyrim
[0:46:34] <+Hollow_Mirage> Halo invented Choir
[0:46:34] <JobbedBone> weird al is halo
[0:46:35] <%Puhff> Pat is having a Boss Baby moment
[0:46:36] <DSD24> @quantras6 Are you talking about the Cool Violin lady? she's got a great portrait
[0:46:37] <+SinisterBroccoli> You've been crazier lately
[0:46:38] <BliVru> Is Halo a Destiny prequel?
[0:46:39] <%Ghufufin> @BedHome  ty
[0:46:39] <Sharpevil> I can't believe the halo theme was recorded entirely by 30 teenage boys in a high school bathroom
[0:46:40] <%athuramn> new ring tone right there
[0:46:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hooooooohooooooooohooooohoooo
[0:46:42] <%Ches_Neckbeard> that's to many options oh god
[0:46:42] <+transporterthesequel> I still haven’t beaten the character creator. I only have 1 out of 8 mythic path characters made.
[0:46:43] <+Shonen_hero> Right?
[0:46:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> @BoxNavy Hey lo
[0:46:44] <rasamune> CNLSCLE
[0:46:44] <ChungusQuest> Is a Skyrim a Halo?
[0:46:46] <DSD24> Off when you see a trap
[0:46:48] <jumpyhugs> Sung the halo song in an empty church once, it was tingly
[0:46:49] <%polothegreatest> is this a bibel gaem?
[0:46:52] <%stantheman_97> listening to a choir and going "yo is this a halo reference???"
[0:46:53] <$lotharrio> There's like two.
[0:46:53] <CollinsOfBodom> he doesn't afraid of anything
[0:46:57] <%DianaTheAscian> @ChungusQuest yes
[0:47:02] <lambishly> Skyrim is like Oo Ahh OOH
[0:47:05] <+InvertableQuasar> From what I remember you might want to turn on a bunch of the pause settings
[0:47:07] <ChungusQuest> good to know
[0:47:07] <quantras6> @dsd24 the one of the inquisitor looking guy in the rain
[0:47:09] <+AugustRei> oh yeah that was driving me crazy
[0:47:09] <%Agami23> its inverted
[0:47:10] <%Treuan> OH god that's horrible
[0:47:12] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Hey Pat, Auto level up companions is on by default.
[0:47:13] <+Shonen_hero> no, this is not a bible game. It has fantasy angels and crusaders
[0:47:15] <%bevyrage> oh god it's the FF11 camera rotation
[0:47:16] <+JJJKopf> no Pat you're wrong
[0:47:19] <+InvertableQuasar> Like "Pause when you see a trap" or "Pauise when you see a new enemy"
[0:47:23] <+transporterthesequel> OH GOD YES
[0:47:25] <heartlesshealer> oh no
[0:47:26] <DSD24> @quantras6 Oh yeah that guy is rad, reminded me of Alucard honestly
[0:47:28] <+AugustRei> pat play a Dinosaur Druid it's cool and good
[0:47:29] <%TheWinged7> just like divinity did?
[0:47:30] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  under difficulty
[0:47:31] <%The_Death_Owl> We ARE playing one of them devil games tonight!
[0:47:32] <+transporterthesequel> I had to fix that immediately
[0:47:32] <%Ghufufin> murder auto level
[0:47:33] <kingdinkyI> but you might want that on tho
[0:47:37] <+TreskM> Difficulty
[0:47:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow look at all those toggles
[0:47:41] <+AugustRei> it's in difficulty
[0:47:41] <%Piemono> Might be under Difficulty
[0:47:44] <%darklordfodder> Might play Kingmaker after I finish the current story content of FFXIV.
[0:47:45] <+transporterthesequel> No KEEP IT.
[0:47:46] <+AugustRei> you have to wait
[0:47:47] <DSD24> Just start new game and you will get options
[0:47:47] <crazypieman7> @PatStaresAt it might be under the difficulty settings
[0:47:47] <+andreeg24> difficulty settings turns off auto lvl
[0:47:48] <%Gogogolem> its under difficulty when you start game
[0:47:49] <+Hollow_Mirage> Auto Level in pathfinder will get you killed tbh
[0:47:50] <$zyberion626> you have to start the game
[0:47:51] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can cancel auto level up while leveling up a character
[0:47:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's like the Chrome experimental options menu
[0:47:51] <%BoxNavy> he cant even 1 find it
[0:47:52] <%moonmintparadise> enable turn based, pat
[0:47:53] <+HellCopter> Difficulty: YEs
[0:47:54] <+radda343> it's under difficulty when you start
[0:47:54] <+JJJKopf> it's under difficulty after you start a game
[0:47:54] <+boriss96> chat over/under 1hr in character creator?
[0:47:56] <battlefeels1996> Drink some water
[0:47:56] <%Nekros4442> Keep it on. You still get to make the choice
[0:47:58] <%Ghufufin> ok but fr lets try to be civil when we start yelling char options at Pat
[0:48:00] <Sharpevil> CHOOSE MAIN STORY
[0:48:03] <%Puhff> LUL
[0:48:03] <%logoth_> Is this another white rpg
[0:48:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> kill the angry man
[0:48:08] <%BoxNavy> look at that satan
[0:48:08] <zerointelligence000> that's a diablo
[0:48:09] <$zyberion626> Pathfinder art is awesome
[0:48:09] <DSD24> Casual!
[0:48:10] <+transporterthesequel> Trust me this is the one game where you will need fuckin autolevel companions
[0:48:12] <heartlesshealer> room for dlc I guess
[0:48:16] <DSD24> This game is super hard Pat
[0:48:19] <%Ghufufin> game has assholish difficulty
[0:48:19] <cheapdoc> Pathfinder monsters are HARD
[0:48:21] <%RealThiele> Solars suck that balor is gonna win
[0:48:23] <%Gogogolem> Cause fuck
[0:48:23] <+HellCopter> To make it less swingy
[0:48:24] <%logoth_> enemy crits are weak too
[0:48:25] <+AugustRei> because this game is very brutal
[0:48:26] <lambishly> Pathfinder is very unforgiving
[0:48:26] <%Dakuu75> huh
[0:48:27] <$zyberion626> weak crits are for enemy crits on YOU
[0:48:27] <kingdinkyI> you will just die super hard
[0:48:27] <%Piemono> Turn on Dead Companions revive and Remove Negative effects
[0:48:28] <DSD24> Pat those are enemy crits
[0:48:28] <+JustToWatch> normal gives the ENEMIES weak crits
[0:48:29] <signofzeta> It's because the core ruleset is hardass
[0:48:29] <%Ghufufin> if its anything like Kingmaker
[0:48:29] <+Shonen_hero> because this game is fucking hard
[0:48:31] <%Nekros4442> The game is hard
[0:48:32] <%Gogogolem> No Normal is good
[0:48:33] <battlefeels1996> Pat pls drink water
[0:48:33] <butthurtdave> Normal's weird, fine tune it to your preferences
[0:48:35] <Manwad> oh because pathfinder monsters are FUCKED
[0:48:36] <hatios1> The first one was super hard, thats why
[0:48:36] <+TreskM> Game is way to hard for new players on core
[0:48:37] <%HollowedIdjit> @patstaresat because Pathfinder is brutal
[0:48:37] <%darklordfodder> So crits don't one-shot you as much
[0:48:37] <DSD24> Your crits will be good
[0:48:38] <+DeadPhoenix3> pathfinder is not nice. but normally you dont need to worry about a main cahracter dieing and ending the game
[0:48:38] <lambishly> Bad luck = instant death
[0:48:38] <heartlesshealer> seems Casual for normal
[0:48:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Because there's 4 difficulty levels above it?
[0:48:39] <sendart> Because this system is fucked
[0:48:39] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the one game type of which I will SLAM it on "Casual" and never take it off
[0:48:40] <+JJJKopf> go ahead and start on core and you'll find out real quick
[0:48:41] <EasternEagle21> @cheapdoc Only because Owlcat fuckin loves spiking up enemies stats for literally no reason
[0:48:41] <$lotharrio> Because Pathfinder is tough and you probably don't know how to min-max the system.
[0:48:44] <battlefeels1996> You look like death :(
[0:48:44] <count_bob> because the game is fucking hard.
[0:48:44] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah this game is fuckin HARD
[0:48:46] <+Immortalsblade> Because Core level 1 will murder you
[0:48:48] <mattynezz> because this game fucks
[0:48:49] <+BedHome> for people who arent used to pathfinder
[0:48:53] <%Ghufufin> they inflate the normal stats of enemies
[0:48:54] <DSD24> Here we go!
[0:48:54] <penitentpendant> It sounds like they are targetting 'casual' as their 'normal audience'
[0:48:56] <zanzibarian_hamster> A lot of DnD games just straight up turn off player crits because they are busted
[0:48:57] <cheapdoc> @cheapdoc Oh for sure
[0:48:58] <%DianaTheAscian> no for the goblins
[0:48:59] <+JustToWatch> turn on turn based
[0:49:00] <+HellCopter> At level one you're basically made of tissue paper
[0:49:02] <Orenjevel> Trust it, it removes a bit of swingyness from the standard ruleset
[0:49:02] <%DianaTheAscian> now*
[0:49:04] <%HollowedIdjit> Weak Crits affect how hard the ENEMY critically strikes you @patstaresat
[0:49:05] <%Puhff> becuase when enemies crit you, you get fucking obiterated
[0:49:06] <+DerivedKnight> You SURE you want Auto-Level off when you have choice paralysis with just your character?
[0:49:09] <%logoth_> lol
[0:49:09] <+AugustRei> YUNELARD
[0:49:09] <%The_Death_Owl> rocks are always fun
[0:49:11] <DSD24> Boring Fighter man
[0:49:11] <heartlesshealer> Pat, there is a standard cyclops with an auto-crit ability. Enjoy that if they put it in the game :)
[0:49:12] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[0:49:12] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[0:49:14] <%SirGO0SE> LUL

[0:51:20] <%YakumoYomi> Bloodrager is "Barbarian + Sorceror"
[0:51:21] <%RealThiele> Borbarian
[0:51:22] <+DerivedKnight> @PatStaresAt Bloodrager is a Barbarian who has Magic.
[0:51:22] <Dellago> A lot of these classes are hybrids too, like Bloodrager is a Barbarian/Sorcerer
[0:51:22] <+Shonen_hero> because you never deviate
[0:51:22] <%ComfortableStranger> bard?
[0:51:22] <%Questiy> its a MAGICAL barbarian
[0:51:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Berserker?
[0:51:24] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt Alchemist is much easier if you pick Vivisectionist. Bloodrager is a barbarian that has some spells.

[0:51:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat pls.
[0:51:51] <+Immortalsblade> If you want an easy class just play a war priest
[0:51:51] <%logoth_> how many fucking clases are there
[0:51:51] <DSD24> Oracles are curssed
[0:51:53] <heartlesshealer> Kineticist is a psychic Bender
[0:51:53] <%alphonseisbest> MAKE A DARK KNIGHT FROM FF14!
[0:51:54] <%darklordfodder> oracle is a sorcerer Cleric
[0:51:54] <%Ghufufin> oralce is a variant cleric
[0:51:55] <Sharpevil> Oracle is a religious sorcerer
[0:51:55] <%AncelDeLambert> Most of these are Hybrid Classes
[0:51:56] <BliVru> MAKE DRIZZT
[0:51:56] <%Ches_Neckbeard> this already has way to many classes
[0:51:56] <$CasualSleepyGamer> Goku Monk
[0:51:57] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Is Kineticist still cancerously busted in this game?
[0:51:57] <viewtifulr> but do we have GOLBEZ?
[0:52:00] <%linSP> fart gas magic
[0:52:01] <%bevyrage> man this class list is so goddamn granular
[0:52:01] <%Puhff> Oracle is a priest
[0:52:03] <+Mach_T_Rex> There's a lot of redundancy in Pathfinder subclasses
[0:52:04] <%newtype89> orical is a claric but everything hurts
[0:52:05] <%AncelDeLambert> I second playing a War Priest
[0:52:06] <+Ataraxis9> man he is ready to throw hands
[0:52:06] <MrChaosDoughnut> Oracle is a holy sorcerer, basically.
[0:52:06] <quantras6> @patstaresat Skald is a Barbarian/Bard, Kineticist is basically a bender from Avatar.
[0:52:07] <%AgniBrandt> Oracle is to Cleric what Sorceror is to Wizard
[0:52:07] <Dellago> Oracle is a cleric who uses charisma instead of wisdom basically
[0:52:08] <%RealThiele> cleric but less options for oracle
[0:52:10] <butthurtdave> Be a nerd and go Cleric
[0:52:11] <TioXyco> a shame-in?

[0:52:28] <Sharpevil> God damn, they added HELLA options to this one
[0:52:29] <+AugustRei> slayer is ranger/rogue
[0:52:30] <nelsonsaysbooya> What's your guess as to the class Pat will pick?
[0:52:31] <+DerivedKnight> Slayer's a Ranger/Rogue type
[0:52:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> \m/ SLAYER
[0:52:32] <%YakumoYomi> Glass cannon
[0:52:32] <+mad_duck666> slayer is sooooo good!
[0:52:32] <+Hollow_Mirage> Slayer are rangers that like to murder people
[0:52:32] <Vyskus> Slayer is better Ranger
[0:52:32] <+TreskM> slayer is dps chad
[0:52:33] <Lefanque> slayer is a combat rogue
[0:52:33] <MrChaosDoughnut> Slayer's Rogue/Ranger.
[0:52:33] <%newtype89> rouge
[0:52:33] <%Gogogolem> Slayers are great
[0:52:33] <%MightyDuckShoes> when did this come out?
[0:52:34] <%darklordfodder> Skald is a Bardbarian
[0:52:34] <signofzeta> slayer kills good
[0:52:34] <%king_wragles> sneaky fighter
[0:52:34] <DSD24> Slayers are great!
[0:52:35] <cheapdoc> Like a chad ranger
[0:52:36] <+DeadPhoenix3> a combo of ranger and rogue for slayer
[0:52:36] <%blue8moon> slayers slay things I would imagine
[0:52:36] <%sandrews> slayer ranger fighter?
[0:52:36] <%HollowedIdjit> Slayer is Rogue + Ranger
[0:52:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> RangerBarb
[0:52:37] <%Ghufufin> more killy rogue
[0:52:38] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt Don't worry about slayer
[0:52:39] <+Shonen_hero> oracle is like... the equivalent of a sorcerer to a wizard
[0:52:39] <Myrkbat> Assassin guy
[0:52:40] <jbrachob> assasin creed man
[0:52:40] <@Ranryu692> glass cannon physical
[0:52:41] <%DianaTheAscian> hes a gg character

[0:52:44] <%Meekest> SLAYER
[0:52:45] <%TheWinged7> ranger/rouge
[0:52:45] <+transporterthesequel> Pat is going to be an Inquisitor btw.
[0:52:45] <+andreeg24> at the keyboard, ask your questions!
[0:52:46] <lord_sykos> some of these are hybrids
[0:52:46] <Orenjevel> Rogue + Ranger = Slayer
[0:52:46] <%Puhff> glass cannon
[0:52:47] <GhostLanterns> slayer best
[0:52:47] <heartlesshealer> Slayer is like monster hunters
[0:52:47] <DSD24> Play a Slayer Pat!
[0:52:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Skald is the viking dude who sings in mead halls then starts a brawl for no reason
[0:52:47] <%RealThiele> roguebarb
[0:52:50] <+InvertableQuasar> Slayer is a pretty good choice for a first character
[0:52:50] <$lotharrio> Slayers are Rangers that are more melee types.
[0:52:52] <lambishly> Slayer is that
[0:52:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt overwhemingly these are all specialty hybrid classes meant for veterans. Think of most of this like Cinders classes
[0:52:52] <$realm_forge> Kineticists.. the seagulls of fantasy classes
[0:52:53] <ape_hawk> a Bogue
[0:52:54] <Treasure_Vault> stealth archer?
[0:52:56] <%sandrews> Bowgue?
[0:52:56] <+megaman_sentinel> dps
[0:52:57] <%Dakuu75> really? interesting.
[0:52:57] <%Agami23> sneaky archer
[0:52:57] <TioXyco> Bowgue, got it
[0:52:58] <+AugustRei> pathfinder has a lot of hybrid classes which are literally just mashups
[0:52:58] <%Questiy> That's slayer
[0:52:58] <Parapattern> Stealth Archer
[0:52:58] <%Gogogolem> Pathfinder loves Rogues with bows.
[0:52:58] <quantras6> @patstaresat skalds are a mix of bard and barbarian
[0:52:58] <+HellCopter> That's fair
[0:52:59] <+TreskM> Slayer is good for that
[0:53:00] <%MidnightBurst12> stealth archers are always busted
[0:53:00] <+JJJKopf> slayer works for that
[0:53:01] <+SilverDevilfish> oh the Skyrim class
[0:53:01] <huskarl_zap> i wish
[0:53:03] <+Immortalsblade> That's a ranger
[0:53:03] <Treasure_Vault> This ain't skyro,
[0:53:04] <DSD24> Slayer is perfect then
[0:53:06] <%MugenSandan> I thought Pat was more into big heavy armor and sword
[0:53:06] <dizimous> Slayer is probably v good for that
[0:53:07] <+andreeg24> game will give you archer's
[0:53:07] <%Agami23> no they use dragon magic
[0:53:08] <butthurtdave> Might wanna dip into Ranger and get a pet, they're really good in these games
[0:53:09] <%Ghufufin> rogue and crits not best friends
[0:53:09] <wolfen091> so is he just not reading the descriptions?
[0:53:09] <Orenjevel> Slayer is a GREAT pick for that
[0:53:10] <%NopeBadguy> Do you need to play Kingmaker for this?
[0:53:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> The coward class
[0:53:11] <%RealThiele> slayers a good fit
[0:53:12] <ape_hawk> so a regular priest?
[0:53:13] <+SinisterBroccoli> ACtually they hate war
[0:53:16] <heartlesshealer> Bloodline magic for Sorcerer
[0:53:16] <kingdinkyI> it's like a warlock
[0:53:16] <+rafaelba93> WITCHER
[0:53:17] <%BoxNavy> be a nasty green witch
[0:53:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> Sorcerer is just a spontaneous arcane caster
[0:53:20] <%darklordfodder> Warpriest would be a good starter
[0:53:20] <Brostress> May we burn her?!
[0:53:20] <%chiazam> Yeaaaaaa BIG Damage stealth ranged rogue
[0:53:21] <ManfredA> I wish they had put in spiritualists
[0:53:23] <Orenjevel> Sorcerers are just wizards but spontaneous and some extra flavor
[0:53:24] <+radda343> sorcerers have inanete magic, mages/wizards learn theirs
[0:53:24] <Chaos_Aether> I heard you can become a dragon, was that a lie or am I missing something
[0:53:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> WTF is a Wizard?
[0:53:25] <$zyberion626> wizards are smelly nerds who have to learn magic, sorcerers are just born with it
[0:53:26] <TioXyco> wizard? you mean fireball?
[0:53:26] <lambishly> Unlock later
[0:53:27] <+Hollow_Mirage> @NopeBadguy No stories are seperate

[0:53:32] <%darklordfodder> prestige
[0:53:32] <%bread_assassin> Pat was blocking it. Is Sylvan Sorcerer still in the game?
[0:53:32] <+InvertableQuasar> oh jesus prestige classes
[0:53:32] <+Mrbaconator> those are prestige classes
[0:53:33] <+DerivedKnight> Those at the bottom are Prestige Classes you can unlock later int he game.

[0:53:36] <+radda343> those are advanced classes
[0:53:36] <SlagChambers> Must be Prestige classes
[0:53:36] <lord_sykos> those are prestige classes, you can unlock them later
[0:53:36] <quantras6> @nopebadguy no, same setting but different plot and area outside of some references.
[0:53:38] <+Mach_T_Rex> You can dip into them later
[0:53:38] <+Shonen_hero> no
[0:53:39] <%ComfortableStranger> do the warrior bard guy
[0:53:40] <heartlesshealer> Witch is pathfinder warlock basically

[0:53:41] <Myrkbat> BIG LORE
[0:53:42] <Orenjevel> *Prestige* classes
[0:53:43] <%newtype89> prestige class
[0:53:44] <%Puhff> Prestige Class son
[0:53:45] <+InvertableQuasar> Stay away from that whole section is my advice
[0:53:45] <+Shonen_hero> no you have to have one of them to have that
[0:53:47] <zerointelligence000> are they the jobs to your classes?
[0:53:48] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt This may be blasphemy, but... If you love playing Rogues that use bows for huge crits, consider playing a Rogue, and getting a bow for huge crits.
[0:53:49] <+kawachipto> prestige classes
[0:53:49] <+TheAdMerlin> Inquisitor is a Paladin who fucks

[0:53:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt If you'd played Dragon Quest you'd be familiar with Prestige classes you coward.
[0:53:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow your cape moves at like 3 FPS
[0:53:57] <%Bailey__gaming> NOBODY EXPECTED HIM
[0:54:01] <%RealThiele> inquisitor is soooo good
[0:54:02] <+nicoleymcquack> zorro class nice
[0:54:02] <%king_wragles> Are there dragonborn in this?
[0:54:02] <Parapattern> Carmen Sandiego Lookin Ass
[0:54:02] <@Ranryu692> I wasn't expecting an inquisitor
[0:54:04] <CollinsOfBodom> unexpected
[0:54:05] <Orenjevel> Inquisitors gain their powers from their fancy hat
[0:54:05] <%darklordfodder> no
[0:54:06] <%insomniac_doze_> m'lady
[0:54:06] <%sandrews> They kick ass for the lord?
[0:54:06] <cheapdoc> It's an edgy paladin
[0:54:07] <Dellago> Inquisistor is a non lawful good paladin as far as I know
[0:54:07] <%pokefan9956> pick at random pat
[0:54:08] <%AncelDeLambert> they're torture clerics
[0:54:08] <%Ghufufin> skill cleric
[0:54:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[0:54:09] <Vyskus> Cleric/Paladin
[0:54:09] <MrChaosDoughnut> Cleric-Rogue.
[0:54:10] <+Immortalsblade> If you like bows play ranger
[0:54:10] <+DeadPhoenix3> no it s cleric rogue combo
[0:54:11] <+Hollow_Mirage> Its a cleric that likes murddr
[0:54:11] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Prestige classes max at 10 levels, where normal classes have a full 20
[0:54:11] <lambishly> Cleric + Ranger ish
[0:54:11] <ManfredA> you can be a pokemon master with monster tactician
[0:54:11] <+glgzephyr> nah that's a Paladin
[0:54:11] <+TheAdMerlin> PALADIN WHO FUCKS
[0:54:12] <%athuramn> is this the red mage
[0:54:12] <+andreeg24> fighter with buff spells
[0:54:13] <Sharpevil> Inquisitors are Asshole Clerics, yes.
[0:54:13] <+transporterthesequel> And we found pats class
[0:54:14] <signofzeta> correct
[0:54:14] <quantras6> Inquisitor can be cool
[0:54:15] <%Shikari21> edgy paladin
[0:54:16] <%darklordfodder> Oh kind of
[0:54:16] <%Puhff> Roguey Paladin
[0:54:17] <DSD24> I'd say Slayer Pat that seems perfect for you
[0:54:17] <+PenmanLupine> Inquisitor is fun
[0:54:18] <+Hollow_Mirage> Murder Paladin
[0:54:19] <+InvertableQuasar> Bow rogue is tough. Ranged sneak attack blech
[0:54:20] <%newtype89> clric/fighter
[0:54:20] <kingdinkyI> but that's just a hell knight
[0:54:21] <%ra_ra_ra_randomhero> I think we should play a monk, but I always play monks when applicable
[0:54:21] <kyro369> play hammer titan
[0:54:22] <Orenjevel> Sneaky Cleric
[0:54:22] <$CasualSleepyGamer> No one expects the Inquisitor
[0:54:22] <heartlesshealer> fighty fight talky cleric detective
[0:54:23] <%RealThiele> paladin rogue
[0:54:23] <+transporterthesequel> They can TARGET PEOPLE
[0:54:24] <digaogrunge> DPS paladins
[0:54:25] <Myrkbat> Paladin / Rogue
[0:54:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it would be nice if the locked classes let you look at what they look like so you know if they're worth it or not
[0:54:26] <+Shonen_hero> i mean yeah
[0:54:28] <%BoxNavy> you CANNOT
[0:54:31] <+transporterthesequel> WITCH HUNTER
[0:54:32] <@Ranryu692> cause you gotta have faith
[0:54:34] <+AugustRei> they are religious batman
[0:54:35] <MrChaosDoughnut> Cool hat tho.
[0:54:35] <%darklordfodder> I got Inquisitor mixed up with Investigator for a second
[0:54:37] <%HollowedIdjit> Inquisitors are more casty  Paladins
[0:54:37] <Dellago> MUST HAVE GOD
[0:54:39] <+InvertableQuasar> Nobody expects the Athiest Inquisition
[0:54:42] <+glgzephyr> DIVINE SMITE
[0:54:42] <%SABiscotti> On a Sneaking Mission from God
[0:54:44] <$lotharrio> It's a Paladin that isn't as good at casting magic but punches harder.
[0:54:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> This class is Bloodborne Pat.
[0:54:47] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> They patched out Atheism
[0:54:48] <%Puhff> Yeah several classes require Faith
[0:54:49] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, as an atheist: how the FUCK are you an atheist in Pathfinder?
[0:54:49] <%Bailey__gaming> Cardinal Fang Fetch the COMFY chair
[0:54:50] <%stantheman_97> atheist inquisition
[0:54:53] <%RealThiele> Judgment they asses
[0:54:54] <quantras6> Inquisitor Judge is pretty good buffer
[0:54:55] <+Pendragwn> Monster Tactician is the dumbest one you can be you can throw like nonstop cats and stuff everywhere
[0:54:56] <lambishly> Sub Classes yea
[0:54:57] <%Ghufufin> archetypes
[0:54:58] <+isadorenta> Oh No
[0:54:58] <+rafaelba93> of course
[0:54:58] <%insomniac_doze_> reading monkaS
[0:54:59] <%Puhff> But Pathfinder Gods are stupid so why bother
[0:55:00] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt Your Moral Alignment opens up different dialog trees/party members depending on where you stand on it.
[0:55:00] <+nicoleymcquack> he can milady the enemies to death
[0:55:01] <%Gogogolem> Most of the subclasses are trash
[0:55:01] <%DianaTheAscian> sub classes
[0:55:05] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can use the base class only
[0:55:06] <cheapdoc> Just chose what sounds cool
[0:55:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Those are just prebuilt subclasses right?
[0:55:07] <lord_sykos> subclasses are optional, you don't need to pick one
[0:55:09] <Orenjevel> Inquisitors make really good sneaky archers
[0:55:09] <%logoth_> animal... with it
[0:55:12] <heartlesshealer> You don't have to pick the archetypes, but they are there
[0:55:12] <%Questiy> Each goblin contains a smaller deadlier goblin
[0:55:13] <%BoxNavy> leader words...
[0:55:15] <%newtype89> oh god be a inquisator of calistra lol
[0:55:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> Can you stack Archetypes in this?
[0:55:19] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Are there hot snake ladies in pathfinder chat? This is important
[0:55:20] <+DerivedKnight> You can either be a base form of the class, or an Archetype that changes things about the base class. Stick with Base Classes to keep it simple!
[0:55:20] <%darklordfodder> Slayer is best Bowgue for a casual build.
[0:55:21] <%pokefan9956> watch. he's gonna puke
[0:55:21] <%Gogogolem> base class is the way to go.
[0:55:21] <%Puhff> If it's anything like Kingmaker, Animal Companions are OP
[0:55:22] <+Hollow_Mirage> I honestly am interested in how cavalier works considering last game had no mounts and owlcat isn't one know for including all the options from tabletop
[0:55:23] <ManfredA> @ReallyBigRocks no, they're archetypes
[0:55:24] <Orenjevel> Don't worry about Archetypes too much, the base classes are all viable
[0:55:26] <%Birdigalore> ITS GONNA BE A FUN NIGHT
[0:55:26] <%darklordfodder> Druid is fun
[0:55:26] <%ComfortableStranger> this seems overly complex
[0:55:26] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt avoid animal companions they're kinda buggy right now
[0:55:27] <DSD24> @AncelDeLambert You basically say "The Gods suck ass and I don't need their help"
[0:55:29] <+DeadPhoenix3> no stacking archtypes
[0:55:29] <butthurtdave> Don't forget to breath Pat
[0:55:30] <$lotharrio> Go Rogue
[0:55:31] <%AncelDeLambert> ignore 80% of these classes
[0:55:32] <lambishly> Slayer is probably your speed
[0:55:33] <+InvertableQuasar> What do you want to do Pat? Chat will tell you
[0:55:34] <DSD24> Slayer Pat!
[0:55:34] <+PenmanLupine> wtf was that gas leak
[0:55:34] <ChungusQuest> Shortstack Alucard?
[0:55:34] <ozmodek> @patstaresat click details on the right
[0:55:35] <%ComfortableStranger> bard
[0:55:35] <+TreskM> Go archer slayer
[0:55:36] <%RealThiele> Leader words like Synergy
[0:55:37] <%Gogogolem> Thats a good idea.
[0:55:38] <Manwad> Fightermans
[0:55:38] <%BoxNavy> this character creator was made to kill people
[0:55:39] <digaogrunge> SO JUST PICK ONE PAT
[0:55:39] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Subclasses can generally be ignored unless you see something you really like
[0:55:40] <%bevyrage> @GeneralSCPatton nope, you get one archetype each class
[0:55:41] <%Order_of_Mystery> Slayer may be a good choice
[0:55:42] <%redthebaron> yeah i get it
[0:55:43] <+AugustRei> yeah subclasses are for perverts
[0:55:43] <%DianaTheAscian> the goblins are very strong today
[0:55:44] <$CasualSleepyGamer> Pat makes ungodly noise
[0:55:44] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt just think of it like your reading the wiki for ff14 classes
[0:55:44] <%Puhff> Do a Slayer, fuck it
[0:55:45] <%HollowedIdjit> tbh that's fine
[0:55:45] <heartlesshealer> Archetypes are bonus customization, Base Class is FINE
[0:55:46] <+Shonen_hero> okay, then slayer or rogue are good out the box
[0:55:47] <%Monkeyweed21> what sounds interesting to you?
[0:55:49] <%Ghufufin> PSA prestiege classes are often times a trap in Pathfinder
[0:55:49] <%toastchi> You can classes after the tutorial if you do not like your class.
[0:55:50] <%Gogogolem> subclasses are for gimmick builds.
[0:55:50] <p_e_a_x> Slayer sounds like a good mix
[0:55:51] <omegadarknes> SLAYER WIHT A BOW
[0:55:52] <+DeadPhoenix3> slayer is good if you want sneak attack bow i think
[0:55:52] <rasamune> Guys chill
[0:55:53] <+transporterthesequel> @anceldelambert the game explains it on these screens actually! Basically Aethiests say fuck it they are all just super powered beings, not like GODS god. And they’re right btw
[0:55:55] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt What kind of character do you want to play
[0:55:55] <quantras6> Atheism in Pathfinder is "Yeah I know god's exist, but fuck them."
[0:55:55] <SlagChambers> Play a Monk!
[0:55:56] <vVAstrAVv> the goblins have already STOPPED this playthrough
[0:55:56] <%rekinom> I'm getting secondhand anxiety
[0:55:57] <%Piemono> Slayer is probably safe
[0:55:58] <Orenjevel> archetypes are fun *after* you've played the base class
[0:56:03] <%GarbageNirvana> This seems like the kinda game where you can grow into whatever kinda flavor you want
[0:56:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> play a character that absolutely blows
[0:56:03] <%RealThiele> rogue, slayer, inquisitor are all good picks
[0:56:03] <nelsonsaysbooya> What did pat play in Divinity 2?
[0:56:05] <%pokefan9956> play a shaman
[0:56:05] <jbrachob> go MONK
[0:56:06] <%sandrews> Druid!
[0:56:07] <%doomunderthestairs> dworf monk could be fun
[0:56:08] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Got a punch monk Pat
[0:56:08] <+AugustRei> slayer ain't shabby
[0:56:09] <+gheremy84> Monk!
[0:56:09] <lambishly> Druid?
[0:56:11] <count_bob> Slayer.
[0:56:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> You should pick something melee for your first run in this one.
[0:56:11] <iambqb> Holy Class would be unique then
[0:56:12] <+fetrigon> slayer
[0:56:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Min-max it but backwards
[0:56:12] <%TheWinged7> monky times?
[0:56:14] <%toastchi> FAir
[0:56:15] <dreadedcthulhu> magus?
[0:56:15] <dyllustrate> Maybe monk?
[0:56:16] <Dellago> I was a GUN Rogue in Pillars, that was fun
[0:56:16] <%insomniac_doze_> shaman
[0:56:16] <tanarath> Subclasses are for muchkins & weird cool bs
[0:56:16] <TioXyco> lacks a main healer there
[0:56:16] <%MugenSandan> Melee DPS?
[0:56:17] <dark_kebabs> ğ
[0:56:18] <+Shonen_hero> you can also multiclass, but that gets into bullshit that might take some time to parse
[0:56:18] <butthurtdave> Depends on how complex you want to be
[0:56:20] <%sw_paladin> Fighter is easiest
[0:56:22] <+Tainted_Ninja> Base Slayer is a safe option, decent amount of skills as well.
[0:56:24] <$lotharrio> Pure Monk isn't too bad of an idea.
[0:56:25] <zerointelligence000> bard
[0:56:26] <+DeadPhoenix3> inquisitor is good for ddwarf
[0:56:26] <digaogrunge> BIG POLL TIME
[0:56:28] <paltar4> Oracle
[0:56:28] <DSD24> Dwarf Slayer sounds great
[0:56:29] <+glgzephyr> your race doesn't have to limit your class
[0:56:30] <%Ghufufin> Monk or Kineticist/ Warpriest/Cleric
[0:56:30] <kingdinkyI> there is a dwarf only monk
[0:56:30] <$realm_forge> Play an agoraphobic Druid!!
[0:56:31] <%chance_h> You can see Pat breaking, time to just play HoneyPop instead
[0:56:32] <+Shonen_hero> clerics would be a good choice for dwarf
[0:56:33] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Dwarf Monk
[0:56:34] <+InvertableQuasar> Dwarfs are good for most stuff
[0:56:35] <nelsonsaysbooya> Dorf Witch lets do this
[0:56:35] <%newtype89> bloodrager be a spellslinging barb
[0:56:35] <lambishly> Druid with a Dog
[0:56:36] <%Questiy> Bloodragers cast spells and swing big sword
[0:56:36] <%darklordfodder> Warpriest is solid
[0:56:37] <Myrkbat> Dwarf good in Druid and Religious Classes
[0:56:38] <%sandrews> Go druid turn into the animals
[0:56:38] <@GeneralSCPatton> Dwarf Inquisitor pretty good
[0:56:38] <+andreeg24> can make any race work for any job
[0:56:39] <omegadarknes> slay her
[0:56:40] <%Dakuu75> only thing he needs is a belt that says "Bamf"
[0:56:41] <%Nekros4442> play monk
[0:56:42] <+Immortalsblade> He shouldn't play a monk if he's new to pathfinder
[0:56:43] <%Gogogolem> Bloodrager.
[0:56:44] <%RealThiele> monk is meh
[0:56:44] <+DerivedKnight> If you're gonna go Dwarf, Dwarf's are great at Cleric and Melee Classes with their bonuses.
[0:56:48] <%AncelDeLambert> AD&D sucks, tho
[0:56:51] <heartlesshealer> I would say that Monster Hunter characters are Slayers if that gives anyone an idea of what they are
[0:56:52] <%toastchi> Ba-Ba-Barbarian?
[0:56:53] <+Shonen_hero> i mean it kinda does, there's a bunch of racial modifiers
[0:56:53] <+nicoleymcquack> inquisitor just catapults me back to you stopping your dragon age stream because of the frame drops rip
[0:56:54] <%Ghufufin> this is true
[0:56:55] <mattynezz> Emily Slayer that uses two weapons is pretty simple
[0:56:56] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt Dwarves get extra CON and WIS, so Inquisitor is actually a great choice.
[0:56:57] <quantras6> @patstaresat why not a Skald? it's basically a Barbarian that gets some bard stuff?
[0:56:58] <+Pendragwn> Dwarf Inquisitor!
[0:56:59] <vonmaultke> Magic light armour bezerker?
[0:57:01] <+transporterthesequel> Dude you would actually dig  Inquisitor after you get your feat wet.
[0:57:01] <%RealThiele> it sorta does still in 3.5
[0:57:01] <+AugustRei> idk about dwarf but tiefling had a LOT of options that basically give you every stat array
[0:57:03] <%Dakuu75> who's the cowboy from Overwatch?
[0:57:07] <%newtype89> this is 3.75
[0:57:10] <%Kyma1020> Pathfinder fixed that problem. Wish D&D stopped that
[0:57:11] <%darklordfodder> Also good druids.
[0:57:12] <Dellago> There are race specific subclasses in this which is cool, I think Dwarves get a Paladin subclass
[0:57:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> Inquisitors have WIS casting
[0:57:13] <vVAstrAVv> pat playing a dwarf is as cliche as woolie saying fighting game shit
[0:57:14] <%Gogogolem> Slayer is fantastic.
[0:57:14] <+DeadPhoenix3> inquisitor is good for dwarf since it is Wisdom base
[0:57:17] <%cylish> If you play a hunter, you can have a pet dog
[0:57:18] <+InvertableQuasar> Inquisitor if I remember correctly can be pretty good sneaky archers
[0:57:18] <%decent_gaming> Ranger is fun. and you can make gief your pet
[0:57:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He does have a hat
[0:57:20] <mattynezz> use a Slayer that uses two weapons
[0:57:20] <quantras6> SOME subclasses require specific races
[0:57:20] <+rafaelba93> shit
[0:57:21] <DSD24> Slayer also has cool studied Target
[0:57:21] <%Ghufufin> slayers are not inherently punchy
[0:57:22] <%logoth_> MORE CHARTS
[0:57:23] <SlagChambers> @AncelDeLambert What you saying you don't love Save or Die poisons?!
[0:57:25] <%Birdigalore> RUN
[0:57:29] <digaogrunge> ez game slayer wins
[0:57:29] <%drabberfaun535> does this game fry your cpu like kingmaker did?
[0:57:30] <%Dopamien> NotLikeThis
[0:57:30] <+JJJKopf> it's the level up path
[0:57:30] <%strugglepunk2> slayer is pretty much a fighter/rogue/ranger hybrid thing
[0:57:31] <joodatious> fuck this screen
[0:57:31] <Orenjevel> Either are good
[0:57:34] <%strugglepunk2> it's pretty neat
[0:57:35] <%Nekros4442> slayers get sneak attack just rock it
[0:57:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, man, just run the game through on Recommended first time
[0:57:39] <+transporterthesequel> YEAH HERE WE GO
[0:57:40] <%MugenSandan> Go monk if you want Punch
[0:57:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's like browsing a DnD wiki but it's a video game
[0:57:40] <+Shonen_hero> yeh
[0:57:41] <+Immortalsblade> Inquisitor is hard for a new player.
[0:57:41] <%sandrews> Go druid you get to become the be animal
[0:57:42] <%RealThiele> ayyyy the class track
[0:57:43] <Myrkbat> YOUR ADVENTURE IS ABOUT SLAYING DEMONS SO INQUISITOR WOULD BE GREAT
[0:57:44] <%cylish> Or if you pick a cavilier you can ride your dog into battle
[0:57:45] <+Shonen_hero> and they're pretty good at it
[0:57:45] <Fenlig> I wouldn't have expected the inquisitor anyway
[0:57:46] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I thought we were in the character creator not a damn Spreadsheet simulator~
[0:57:49] <+andreeg24> slayer is ranger/rogue combo
[0:57:52] <$zyberion626> @drabberfaun535 the game runs much more smoothly
[0:57:52] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh shit, this screen is GREAT!
[0:57:53] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt do you want a class for beginners?
[0:57:56] <+transporterthesequel> NO IT TELLS YOU WHAT YOU CAN CHOOSE
[0:58:00] <+InvertableQuasar> Sneak attack is difficult to get at range. In melee you just need to flank.
[0:58:00] <%Birdigalore> Pat's starting to white out
[0:58:01] <%DoubleRrico> for every generation a ginger is born, he alone will wrestle the mind goblins
[0:58:02] <joodatious> this UI makes character creation look harder then it is
[0:58:08] <+transporterthesequel> As a free class perk.
[0:58:11] <dredgyboi> oh wow, i am not playing this lol
[0:58:16] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt get sneak damage when another ally is engaged with enemy
[0:58:16] <Orenjevel> (Flanking or sneaking)
[0:58:18] <SaltyAzteca> I came here to play vidya games, not learn stats
[0:58:19] <%RealThiele> just gotta have 2 dude in melee to sneak
[0:58:19] <%castlerock42> We are seeing a man's brain fry in real time.
[0:58:19] <quantras6> Honestly a Skald or Slayer would work well
[0:58:21] <ozmodek> @patstaresat pay attention only to level 1 on that screen. deliverer is the best slayer
[0:58:23] <+transporterthesequel> IGNORE, More damage
[0:58:23] <+TreskM> Its super easy to flank in this game
[0:58:25] <%AncelDeLambert> I feel like Pat needs to watch JoCat's D&D class videos real fast
[0:58:26] <%TheWinged7> you cant sneak attack crit, bo
[0:58:27] <zanzibarian_hamster> tl;dr, you do more damage flat out to unaware enemies
[0:58:27] <+DerivedKnight> @PatStaresAt Yep! Slayer's don't get as much Sneak Attack as Rogue's, BUT they get more options from the Ranger that make them more Combat Capable.
[0:58:29] <cheapdoc> It's just extra feats
[0:58:29] <+glgzephyr> Crits don't double the Sneak Attack damage? That's BS!
[0:58:34] <%newtype89> two weapon faness rouge fighter is fun
[0:58:34] <@GeneralSCPatton> Some creature types are immune to Precision damage, like Oozes.
[0:58:36] <heartlesshealer> Precision because things like Slimes are immune to precision (no vital organs)
[0:58:37] <+LazyBumNetwork> No smooth brains allowed
[0:58:42] <%Dakuu75> at least 60% of chat is going "I'll never play this but, I'll watch."
[0:58:42] <Myrkbat> You!
[0:58:42] <%RealThiele> evasion Kreygasm
[0:58:43] <PanicSwytch> Its basically free
[0:58:46] <DSD24> This is why Slayers are cool
[0:58:46] <quantras6> @dredgyboi you can turn the difficulty down if it's too much, but yeah it can be overwhelming.
[0:58:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Tonight. You.
[0:58:51] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt heya pat! Ive played around with character creator in this game so fucking much xD
[0:58:52] <%pokefan9956> @PatStaresAt is there a crpg archetype you haven't tried before? might be fun to branch out
[0:58:52] <%SpoonheadInExile> How many fucking anthro races are in Pathfinder?
[0:58:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Choose Fighter, embrace Unga
[0:58:55] <DSD24> You go "Fuck that guy" and then they die
[0:58:56] <+TreskM> Slayers are good at range or dual wield
[0:59:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Honestly most of the classes are cool.
[0:59:05] <cheapdoc> It's just a +1
[0:59:05] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> My smooth brain hates this screen
[0:59:06] <+Shonen_hero> honestly slayer is not bad for a beginner playthrough
[0:59:06] <tanarath> @glgzephyr 5e a shit
[0:59:08] <%TheWinged7> opoment
[0:59:10] <+AugustRei> oh that seems really good for an archer
[0:59:13] <+transporterthesequel> @dakuu75 yeah, until they find out about the Mythic Path system.
[0:59:15] <CruxAustralis> Slayers are good at single target damage
[0:59:18] <+PenmanLupine> I'm absolutely here to watch Pat have a stroke
[0:59:18] <DSD24> Barbarian is super Unga Buna
[0:59:19] <%NateyBeak> Pat Stares At Pathfinder: Part 0 (1/35)
[0:59:20] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god
[0:59:20] <cheapdoc> it's like a free action
[0:59:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> But some require knowledge of the game systems or you will be fucked hard.
[0:59:23] <%komradedog> A FREE ACTION ONCE PER TURN
[0:59:25] <omegadarknes> basically a free action
[0:59:27] <Myrkbat> Basically inquisitor or slayer would be great because this campaign is about killing demons
[0:59:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> bonus action?
[0:59:30] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no oh no
[0:59:30] <%Birdigalore> Brain...poop
[0:59:32] <lambishly> Oh god he's skimming
[0:59:32] <%Gogogolem> Free action
[0:59:34] <%chiazam> When did this game come out?
[0:59:34] <$zyberion626> free action that you can only do once a turn
[0:59:35] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt thats the ranger part, he wants to focus on one person
[0:59:35] <+isadorenta> is he ok
[0:59:36] <+Shonen_hero> this really only matters with turn based tbh
[0:59:37] <+transporterthesequel> Slayer is also unga bunga
[0:59:38] <butthurtdave> It's like a free action but more limited
[0:59:39] <%Puhff> I hate this part
[0:59:39] <%Nekros4442> swift action means you can use it but still move or attack in the same round
[0:59:39] <pacibuddy> this is why you just say fuck it
[0:59:39] <TioXyco> seagulls
[0:59:39] <dreadedcthulhu> LMAO
[0:59:40] <CruxAustralis> TURN ON TURN BASED MODE TRUST ME  @PatStaresAt
[0:59:40] <%Questiy> It's not on GCD
[0:59:40] <zerointelligence000> oh no
[0:59:41] <%RealThiele> 1 free action you can take each turn
[0:59:41] <+AugustRei> so you get 1 swift, 1 move, and 1 action
[0:59:41] <lambishly> Swift = fast pat
[0:59:42] <kingdinkyI> bro just player a fighter or Barb
[0:59:42] <austinj24> Doesn't  take move or action
[0:59:42] <%HollowedIdjit> it begins
[0:59:42] <+LazyBumNetwork> Free action per turn
[0:59:43] <+BedHome> pat do you know how to read
[0:59:43] <heartlesshealer> The game should really explain action types before giving you the character creator, honestly
[0:59:44] <+InvertableQuasar> You get a move action, a standard action, and a swift action every turn to spend as you want
[0:59:44] <k_af> !BRAIN AT RISK!
[0:59:44] <+Phantomjay> i would not be able to play this
[0:59:44] <+Aullama> danBrain Mm, yes of course
[0:59:44] <%JonathLP> Pat's instruction talk has literally become crazy talk
[0:59:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, calm down and choose a Baldur's Gate starter class
[0:59:45] <%drabberfaun535> DISC ROOM!
[0:59:45] <%darklordfodder> Lol if this hurts your brain, do fighter
[0:59:46] <+andreeg24> you get a move, a standard, a swift and free actions
[0:59:46] <+tomdwarf> Basically, you get move, attack, and swift action per turn.
[0:59:47] <quantras6> Pat should properly know that in the first act of the game a lot of party members you get are quite squishy save one.
[0:59:47] <%cylish> Each turn is Move/action/swift action
[0:59:47] <%athuramn> it's like my dyslexia in a stream
[0:59:47] <%BoxNavy> streamer passes away from creating digital character
[0:59:48] <SaltyAzteca> STATISTICS IN MY VIDEO GAMES
[0:59:48] <%Ghufufin> You can do a swift and still move and attack
[0:59:49] <+JJJKopf> the first boss is reading
[0:59:49] <+Phantomjay> i am at my limit
[0:59:49] <%MugenSandan> SUPERMAN WROTE THIS DIDNT HE
[0:59:49] <Vyskus> ! GOBLINS AT RISK !
[0:59:50] <DSD24> Pat just pick Slayer its gonna go great
[0:59:51] <digaogrunge> THIS IS DND PAT
[0:59:51] <+nicoleymcquack> there is so much text on screen and pat is broken oh god
[0:59:52] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Instead of moving you look for a weak point and get a bonus to your dice rolls
[0:59:52] <sendart> attack move swift free
[0:59:52] <dreadedcthulhu> i've read the pfsrd front to back enough times to already understand lmao
[0:59:52] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt basically its a side resource that just means you can do it without losing out on attacking, moving and casting spells
[0:59:53] <dizimous> Rollover text :Z 🙏
[0:59:53] <%strugglepunk2> basically a once a turn thing that doesn't use a move or a normal attack
[0:59:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt play the game before theorycrafting maybe?
[0:59:53] <+transporterthesequel> BREAK TIME
[0:59:53] <%bread_assassin> Guessing this is NOT gonna be a full LP.
[0:59:54] <AzureGale> Pat Sanity -10
[0:59:54] <butthurtdave> BREATHE PAT
[0:59:55] <%darklordfodder> Slayer is one of the simpler classes
[0:59:55] <%spitelite> oh here we go
[0:59:56] <Orenjevel> Slayer is easy enough to Unga Bunga dont sweat it
[0:59:57] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt breath
[0:59:59] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Most of this is in a players handbook that is at least a light novel in length
[1:00:03] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt in D&D its a bonus action iirc
[1:00:03] <BliVru> LET THE DARKNESS ENTER YOUR HEART SORA
[1:00:05] <%saadi90> nyannOwo
[1:00:09] <+slaquerboy> Just play Human Fighter and be done with it
[1:00:12] <+glgzephyr> aw yeah let's read every class and subclass LUL
[1:00:12] <%Monkeyweed21> SUPERMAN UNIRONICALLY PLAYS THIS GAME
[1:00:14] <%AncelDeLambert> someone get Plague in here to snark at Pat, I think that will help
[1:00:15] <lambishly> As someone who dms path tabletop I feel your pain
[1:00:17] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt So: On any turn, you have your movement action, standard action, swift action, and as many free actions as you want
[1:00:20] <%RealThiele> id also guarentee hed have fun just picking race and class snd hitting recommended button
[1:00:20] <+tomdwarf> Oh man, I was NOT expecting Kineticist to show up in this.
[1:00:22] <+Shonen_hero> Inquisitor has Sanctified Slayer, which is a sort of fusion of cleric and slayer
[1:00:24] <+TreskM> every skill LUL
[1:00:26] <+thetunnelhomer> Oh god Pathfinder, this game has too many choices
[1:00:28] <doctor_kelso> Combat is made of several things. Move action, Standard Action, Swift Action, Free action. Move allows you to move, standard is something like an attack, swift is it's own thing and free is another.
[1:00:28] <$realm_forge> HOLD PAT HOOOOOOOLD
[1:00:32] <%Dakuu75> WEAPONIZE RELIGION
[1:00:33] <%KineticZen> Dwarf Clint Eastwood
[1:00:34] <+JJJKopf> inquisitor has everything
[1:00:34] <+DerivedKnight> Inquisitor's are Sneaky Paladin/Cleric's
[1:00:35] <quantras6> @slaquerboy honestly human two handed fighter works pretty well
[1:00:40] <+InvertableQuasar> @tomdwarf Right? That's wild, might pick this up just for that
[1:00:41] <Saltmeisterr> LORE
[1:00:42] <%Ghufufin> If you go for a caster go for spontaneous
[1:00:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Who's Will?
[1:00:49] <+thetunnelhomer> Inquisitor is a cleric rogue
[1:00:50] <+TheAdMerlin> I want the Patquisitor!
[1:00:52] <heartlesshealer> goddd, I forgot that Use Magical Device was an entire different skill in 1E
[1:00:53] <%Gogogolem> iquistor spells suck
[1:00:53] <%CodyKnowsNothing> Getting anxious just looking at this screen
[1:01:05] <lambishly> Druid + Geif Dog
[1:01:09] <AzureGale> Hawt
[1:01:10] <Myrkbat> Spontaenous casters are chads
[1:01:11] <+LazyBumNetwork> Just unga bunga. I’m sure your party members can carry
[1:01:13] <Seth_Tek> Sacred Huntsman is fucking great!
[1:01:13] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:01:13] <%Ghufufin> that right Vancian sucks ass
[1:01:14] <ChungusQuest> s l o t s
[1:01:14] <%strugglepunk2> Spontaneous casters get a TON of cool toys in this game
[1:01:15] <Orenjevel> @Gogogolem they have divine favor what do you mean
[1:01:17] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt inquisitor is super fucking dope. In your background you can switch persuasion to wisdom and basically have EVERY SKILL. you also get dope bonuses from "teamwork" feats.
[1:01:17] <ManfredA> Inquisitors are like clerics that specced into buffs and assbeating
[1:01:18] <+BedHome> there is less complexity on this screen than on a single in battle screen from 14 lol
[1:01:18] <+InvertableQuasar> Vancian spell casting is great and I will die on this hill
[1:01:18] <kingdinkyI> Inquisitors aren't worth it for the spells
[1:01:18] <+thetunnelhomer> Go Sacred Huntsmaster and get a super good animal companion
[1:01:25] <%MugenSandan> Maybe see what Monk and Kineticist are like?
[1:01:25] <+transporterthesequel> I believe in you Pat! Slayer hit the thing good, and Inquisitor hit the thing good but then JUDGES them.
[1:01:25] <+Immortalsblade> Hit recommended build since it's your first time in pathfinder
[1:01:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Vancian spellcasters are the SPONTANEOUS ones though.
[1:01:36] <+tomdwarf> Yes pat. An IP address.
[1:01:36] <+glgzephyr> I used to feel that way, but I've grown to appreciate it. It rewards preparation very well
[1:01:37] <DSD24> You get NORDVPN
[1:01:37] <zerointelligence000> boo
[1:01:39] <%HollowedIdjit> @patstaresat Inquisitors are Cleric + Rogue, basically
[1:01:39] <%Puhff> LUL
[1:01:40] <+BedHome> @Immortalsblade that would make him die
[1:01:42] <+Shonen_hero> Inquisitor has a shit ton of skills
[1:01:43] <Myrkbat> remember to get Nord VPN
[1:01:46] <%MightyDuckShoes> what
[1:01:46] <%Birdigalore> PAAAAIGE!  Come get your man
[1:01:46] <quantras6> Inquisitor gets Judgments which are buffs for themselves, and bane weapon which gives a nice buff to your attack. it has a sub class that makes the Judgements affect the party at the cost of losing the bane.
[1:01:47] <SaltyAzteca> MEDIEVAL WEBSITES
[1:01:48] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@lotharrio) (warning)
[1:01:49] <+transporterthesequel> Yes
[1:01:50] <+andreeg24> buff self for massive damage
[1:01:50] <@goose_attack_almanac> My favourite patron deity is Go Daddy dot com
[1:01:52] <%Questiy> HE'S LEARNING
[1:01:52] <%KineticZen> IOF?
[1:01:56] <ManfredA> these are cantrips
[1:01:56] <butthurtdave> Cantrips
[1:01:56] <+thetunnelhomer> And your god's divine weapon
[1:01:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> they are cantrips
[1:01:57] <+DerivedKnight> Orisons are just Faith Cantrips
[1:01:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> Cantrips?
[1:01:58] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt basically free spells that are shitty
[1:01:59] <%SpoonheadInExile> Basically Cantrips
[1:02:00] <Sharpevil> Orison = Cantrip
[1:02:00] <%Piemono> Level 0 spells are just cantrips
[1:02:01] <+Shonen_hero> cantrips basically
[1:02:02] <masheshardest> cantrips
[1:02:03] <%TheFabledAble> yes
[1:02:03] <@Jekado> "USE THE CODE PASTARAID"
[1:02:04] <+DerivedKnight> So Level 0 SPells
[1:02:04] <+pectusumbra> the divine equal to cantrips
[1:02:05] <lambishly> Divine Cantrip
[1:02:05] <%alphonseisbest> What CLASS IN THIS  CAN I USE TO MAKE A WITCHER?
[1:02:05] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> They're just cantrips
[1:02:05] <ManfredA> yes
[1:02:06] <%Kyma1020> Cantrips
[1:02:06] <+DerivedKnight> Yes
[1:02:07] <DSD24> Yes you do
[1:02:07] <+DeadPhoenix3> you pick a few
[1:02:08] <+Shonen_hero> yes
[1:02:08] <heartlesshealer> Orison is just divine Cantrip
[1:02:08] <+thetunnelhomer> Yes
[1:02:09] <+AugustRei> ye they're baby spells
[1:02:09] <+tomdwarf> Yes, you get all of them
[1:02:14] <%strugglepunk2> behold
[1:02:18] <%strugglepunk2> the zapping system
[1:02:21] <%Dakuu75> this stream sank like 10 minutes ago. we're in a fucking submarine with a sunroof now
[1:02:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> They're baby bitch spells for baby bitches.
[1:02:26] <$zyberion626> @alphonseisbest slayers
[1:02:27] <ManfredA> Guidance is amazing btw
[1:02:30] <%Agami23> oh neat, didnt know faith cantrips had a name
[1:02:30] <%HollowedIdjit> JUDGEMENT IS DOPE
[1:02:34] <+DeadPhoenix3> judgements are really good but are limited
[1:02:35] <lambishly> Inquisitor is hella complex pat
[1:02:35] <doctor_kelso> Judgments are buffs.
[1:02:40] <%alphonseisbest> @zyberion626 ty nice
[1:02:42] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Your judgment depends on your god.
[1:02:44] <%Bailey__gaming> is he broken?
[1:02:46] <%Aztec50> The use recommended build button should get slowly bigger the longer you spend in this menu lol
[1:02:47] <quantras6> @patstaresat Judgements are basically buffs for yourself, Bane weapon makes your weapon do more damage
[1:02:47] <Memitim> If you want spontaneous casters then I think you look at sorcerer, oracle and eldritch scion magus. I believe there are a few more
[1:02:49] <DSD24> Judgments are nice
[1:02:49] <$lotharrio> Judgements are auras.
[1:02:49] <+transporterthesequel> Okay so uh Inquisitor’s systems are gonna be a bit MUCH for one sitting
[1:02:50] <%strugglepunk2> it's smite evil, basically but on you
[1:02:55] <%TheFabledAble> basically you chose what bonus you want for that combat
[1:02:56] <%Dakuu75> Will this be on the test, captain?
[1:03:00] <+thetunnelhomer> Go Sacred Huntsmaster for big doggo
[1:03:01] <+AugustRei> yeah you get combat auras
[1:03:02] <dizimous> @patstaresat Judgments are little buffs you can change each turn
[1:03:05] <+InvertableQuasar> I am officially voting Unga-Bunga barbarian to stop Pat's brain from melting out his ears
[1:03:06] <dreadedcthulhu> i cant believe they actually just shoved the entire srd into a video game
[1:03:08] <Xodious987> @PatStaresAt i can confirm that there is respecing available in the game in case you dont like waht you pick. can retcon your entire character, even race and alignment. First time is free
[1:03:09] <%Ghufufin> you get very judgy
[1:03:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Inquisitor is not what I'd recommend for a first playthrough at all.
[1:03:11] <SolumFuturae> Is inquisitor one of the new classes?
[1:03:15] <+glgzephyr> Judgement The Sequel
[1:03:16] <+DeadPhoenix3> second judgement is use two judgements at once
[1:03:18] <Orenjevel> There are way more judgements than there needs to be
[1:03:18] <%TheFabledAble> second judgement lets you benefit from two judgements at once
[1:03:18] <+JJJKopf> 2 at once
[1:03:19] <+nicoleymcquack> what’s more confusing, this or kingdom hearts lore, find out next time on dragon ball z
[1:03:25] <%athuramn> I think inquisitor fits your self sufficient preference no?
[1:03:25] <%Dakuu75> will it be open-book or multiple choice?
[1:03:32] <%ScreamLord> Nobody expect the Gnomish Inquisition
[1:03:38] <%TheFabledAble> teamwork feats give MASSIVE BONUSES
[1:03:39] <+DerivedKnight> @PatStaresAt In the beginning you can aplly only 1 Judgement. At 6th you can apply 2 Judgements, then up to 6 Judgements
[1:03:39] <BigYanno> JUDGIE MEEEENT
[1:03:39] <quantras6> Judge can be pretty fun since you remove the bane to be able to make your judgment buffs affect the entire party
[1:03:40] <$zyberion626> @PatStaresAt Inquisitor is a pretty advanced class, not recommended for newbies
[1:03:41] <Orenjevel> Please tell me your dwarfs name will be Judgement Kazzy
[1:03:41] <+Shonen_hero> so basically
[1:03:48] <heartlesshealer> Solo Tactics is fun as fuck with certain builds
[1:03:49] <Seth_Tek> solo Tactics IS OP!
[1:03:50] <$lotharrio> Lets you get extra stabs and stuff.
[1:03:51] <%PlatinumAvacyn> PlatinumAvacyn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! hi hello
[1:03:52] <joodatious> this sucks
[1:03:52] <+DeadPhoenix3> solo tactics is good because teamwork feats can be pretty powerful
[1:03:52] <DSD24> Teamwork Feats are cool
[1:03:53] <ManfredA> essentially you get to act like you have teamwork feats for free
[1:03:53] <%AncelDeLambert> so many advanced classes
[1:03:54] <%TheWinged7> whut
[1:03:56] <%Ghufufin> normally two ppl have to have teamwork feats to get any benefit
[1:03:56] <%Piemono> Teamwork Feats are feats that give bonus to stats based on if other party members have that teamwork feat
[1:03:56] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Do i need to present a paper at the end of the stream or not ?
[1:03:56] <+Pendragwn> Teamwork feats are shitty feats that everyone needs to have for you to even use them. This removes the poop a lot.
[1:03:57] <count_bob> You want lots of teamwork.
[1:03:57] <lambishly> Inquisitor is so complex I NotLikeThis
[1:03:58] <sendart> you can use teamwork feats without your teamates having them
[1:03:59] <%ArchimerCXV> basically you proc your own teamwork feats, the companions don't need to also have it
[1:04:00] <+tomdwarf> Teamwork feats are feats that both PCs need to have in order to work. This bit lets you assume they auto have them.
[1:04:00] <+transporterthesequel> Solo tactics is BUSTED
[1:04:01] <+andreeg24> teamwork feats you normally have to have multiple people take.  the inquisitor doesn't care
[1:04:01] <zerointelligence000> "her"?
[1:04:01] <quantras6> @screamlord ironically the best companion is a lawful evil gnome
[1:04:04] <Talyndemon> TLDR: You can use teamwork moves without your partner having the same feat
[1:04:08] <%rekinom> Teamwork feats normally only work if you AND your party have the feats, this lets the inquisitor get bonuses @PatStaresAt
[1:04:08] <%BoxNavy> the feets
[1:04:09] <butthurtdave> It buffs you specifically
[1:04:09] <+thetunnelhomer> For you
[1:04:12] <$lotharrio> You do double-techs, on your own.
[1:04:12] <heartlesshealer> All your teamwork feats act like your team mates had them.
[1:04:13] <+RyGuy182> teamwork feats normally only work when two characters both have that feat
[1:04:14] <+InvertableQuasar> Inquisitor maybe has the most features that are completely inscrutable if you're not familiar with the game
[1:04:14] <doctor_kelso> Inquisitor gets the benefit but the ally doesn't.
[1:04:15] <%Monkeyweed21> free synergies
[1:04:16] <%BoxNavy> yes
[1:04:16] <%Gogogolem> For you
[1:04:17] <chaosbringer28> im having slight flashbacks to when I first started tabletop RPGs
[1:04:18] <%GinAndRoses> we got da feets
[1:04:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> Feats that normally affect your party affect you?
[1:04:19] <%TheFabledAble> so basically you benefit regardless of if they have the feat
[1:04:19] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt there are feat type abilities more than one person needs to turn on for both of you. you can turn it on on your own for yourself, fuck helping everyone
[1:04:19] <+thetunnelhomer> It buffs you for the feats
[1:04:20] <omegadarknes> i'll just watch the vod later >>>
[1:04:20] <%Bailey__gaming> show feats
[1:04:21] <ManfredA> it pretends they have the feats for your purposes
[1:04:21] <Memitim> for you and nobody else
[1:04:22] <heartlesshealer> THEY ONLY WORK FOR YOU
[1:04:22] <stormhawk9891> F E E T S
[1:04:26] <DSD24> @quantras6 I just got Regill he's great
[1:04:26] <+PenmanLupine> your doing it
[1:04:27] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah its team buffs for YOU
[1:04:27] <+AugustRei> teamwork feats require two people to have them to get their bonus, that lets you get the bonus without someone else having it
[1:04:28] <dreadedcthulhu> you get the benefits on your own, normally teamwork feats need everyone to have them
[1:04:28] <%Puhff> You gte the Teamwork Feat bonuses but your Teammates dont
[1:04:28] <%HollowedIdjit> Teamwork Feats are weird
[1:04:29] <%Piemono> You get the bonus w/o the other party members having the feat
[1:04:29] <dredgyboi> It gives them teamwork fates YOU have
[1:04:29] <Sharpevil> You get the benefit of the teamwork feat even though usually you'd both need to have it.
[1:04:30] <%HolePunchLeaf> it makes teamwork feats work without requiring everyone to have them (Only for you)
[1:04:32] <+DerivedKnight> Inquisitor's can use Teamwork Feats to make them better, and it pretends your allies have the Feats to make them work for you. Otherwise both characters would need it.
[1:04:33] <sendart> lets you take more feats without worrying about your allies taking them
[1:04:36] <kingdinkyI> it pretends they have the feat so you get the bonus
[1:04:38] <%shruke> you get buffs, they don't
[1:04:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt free synergy bonuses even if they dont have the right skill
[1:04:39] <SaltyAzteca> FIRST BOSS, THE RULES
[1:04:41] <CappuccinoGuil> I was gonna watch another tabletop game, but this is scratches the same itch damn LUL
[1:04:41] <%athuramn> just to determine your own bonuses, so there's no conflict
[1:04:41] <chaosbringer28> teamwork feats require 2 people to take them, you can take them and benefit from it, even if the other person doesnt have it
[1:04:42] <%AncelDeLambert> if you don't understand, then flip the bird at the class
[1:04:43] <dizimous> @patstaresat Teamworm feats normally require 2 allies to both have the feat to function
[1:04:43] <butthurtdave> You get free fake feats during combat so long as you're attacking next to an ally
[1:04:44] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Teamwork feats work if you both have feats. Inquistor only has to have them to get the bonus for them but not your ally
[1:04:44] <%PlatinumAvacyn> gives you the benefits of teamwork feats without others having them
[1:04:45] <@goose_attack_almanac> Your character will proc teamwork feats without your party needing them. BAsically it allows you to use Teamwork feats without your team
[1:04:45] <mattynezz> teamwork feats normally need two people to take them to have any effect, this just lets The Inquisitor use them on their own
[1:04:45] <+darethsbane> You get the bonus but they don't
[1:04:46] <DSD24> Pat you should go Slayer he will be easier to play as
[1:04:47] <@GeneralSCPatton> YOU GET THE TEAMWORK SYNERGY BY YOURSELF
[1:04:47] <%chance_h> Feets
[1:04:47] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt teamwork feats require everyone to have them to work, this gets around that extra poop
[1:04:48] <$lotharrio> Inquisitor gets to do "All Out Attack" but just on his own.
[1:04:49] <Orenjevel> You can combo with yourself so long as a friend is nearby
[1:04:49] <%Ghufufin> normally for a teamwork feat to work two ppl have to it
[1:04:50] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt IT MEANS YOU CAN BUFF YOURSELF
[1:04:50] <$zyberion626> PICK SLAYER @PatStaresAt
[1:04:51] <%MrGuy516> MrGuy516 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 26 month streak! 
[1:04:51] <Seth_Tek> You can use team work feats by them self, Nobody else on the team doesn't need to take them
[1:04:52] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Teamwork feats are supposed to give bonuses to both characters who have both feats, solo tactics means you can get the bonuses if only you have the feat, but your ally doesn't
[1:04:53] <Talyndemon> You can use your teamwork feats.  They still have to buy in to use them
[1:04:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Inquisitor picks a teamwork feat and gets bonus from all her party but her party dont get the feats bonuses cause they dont have them
[1:04:54] <%bevyrage> inquisitors gain access to teamwork feats without needing their allies to have the feats themselves. your allies do not gain the benefits of your feats though.
[1:04:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Teamwork feats are feats you get bonuses from when your party members also have the feat.
[1:04:56] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt there are feats that only work when other allies have feats, solo tactics makes it so your allies don't need to have them for you to get the bonus
[1:04:57] <%Monkeyweed21> FREE SYNERGY BONUSES FOR YOU
[1:04:59] <quantras6> @dsd24 his build is odd since he's a fighter with about 13 strength but as a character he's awesome.
[1:04:59] <heartlesshealer> It's so that you can do stuff without having to fuck up your party's skills
[1:05:01] <digaogrunge> Its pretty clear Pat
[1:05:02] <%darklordfodder> Teamwork feats become normal feats for you.
[1:05:04] <Ralamar> Pat I think you should just play a fighter.
[1:05:04] <%cylish> Teamwork feats, "You get extra damage for attacking with a friend" Both people need to have it to work.  That ability ignores the requierment to have a friend with the feat
[1:05:05] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:05:06] <+Shockrates20XX> Just pick one that sounds cool man and then you'll learn it.
[1:05:06] <%Bailey__gaming> just play as big sword man
[1:05:08] <Sharpevil> HE'S DOING IT
[1:05:10] <%Puhff> God #rd edition was so bloated LUL
[1:05:17] <butthurtdave> You get free bonuses without having to invest other character's feats into buying them
[1:05:17] <%unhuggable1> what
[1:05:19] <%Agami23> basically, when you have a feat that affects other people in your party with the same feat, but they dont get the bonuses
[1:05:20] <%lumporr> show feats
[1:05:21] <%rekinom> Teamwork feats normally only activate if you and someone else both have the feat. This lets the inquisitor get their bonus without your allies needing to take feats (pat
[1:05:21] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt If you have a feat that benefits your teammates, your teammates are treated as if they also have those feats and are applying those bonuses only to you
[1:05:23] <Sharpevil> He figured it out all on his own!
[1:05:24] <%Piemono> Teamwork Feats usually only work if another member has the Feat
[1:05:24] <Orenjevel> Wombo Combo with yourself
[1:05:24] <%Broand> For teamwork feats to work, multiple people have to have them
[1:05:26] <$lotharrio> Inquisitor gets the bonuses for teamwork feats, even if allies don't have the matching feats. Allies don't get the bonuses.
[1:05:26] <+andreeg24> teamwork feats require you to have someone else have the feat.  the inquisitor gets to ignore that and treat the teamwork feat as a regular feat
[1:05:27] <lambishly> Actual reading hours
[1:05:30] <+BedHome> buff yourself and fuck others
[1:05:31] <DSD24> @quantras6 So far I like how straightforward he is comapred to other bodies
[1:05:31] <+fetrigon> ⚙️⚙️⚙️
[1:05:32] <+transporterthesequel> HES DOING IT
[1:05:32] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt for example, you can get a bonus to your AC from how many allies are near you, but your allies wont get this bonus unless trhey also havce that feat
[1:05:33] <%alphonseisbest> HES DOING IT!
[1:05:35] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt teamwork feats get stronger if more people have them
[1:05:35] <quantras6> @patstaresat you get a buff from the feat, they don't unless they have it
[1:05:36] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Teamwork feats only work if multiple characters in the party have them
[1:05:36] <%darklordfodder> pat do you understand my goblins now?
[1:05:37] <%TheWinged7> they need feets, show feets
[1:05:38] <%Piemono> YES
[1:05:38] <%Cn_alpha_02> Teamwork feats normally need multiple members to have the feat in order to work.
[1:05:39] <+DerivedKnight> NOW YOU GOT IT!
[1:05:39] <+transporterthesequel> BY GOD HES GOT IT
[1:05:40] <DSD24> @quantras6 companions I mean
[1:05:41] <lambishly> YES
[1:05:41] <+pectusumbra> It means Inquisitors put the I in team
[1:05:41] <%alphonseisbest> HE DID IT!
[1:05:43] <%bevyrage> quality paizo redundant text that actually confuses more than it clarifies
[1:05:43] <+andreeg24> exactly!
[1:05:43] <DartAran> Pat please stop saying feet so much
[1:05:43] <sendart> KNOWLEDGE
[1:05:44] <Sharpevil> YOU DID IT PAT
[1:05:44] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt teamwork feats are poop that require everyone to have them this gets around it
[1:05:44] <lord_sykos> nailed it
[1:05:45] <+JustToWatch> teamwork feats give bigger number if everyone has them, so this means inquisitor gets bigger number even if allies don't have the needed traits
[1:05:45] <+LazyBumNetwork> Essentially if the feat says it needs two people it still is able to be used
[1:05:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yes Pat, that's the do it!
[1:05:45] <+Shonen_hero> YES!
[1:05:45] <%Bluwizard21> yes
[1:05:46] <%Order_of_Mystery> yes
[1:05:46] <dizimous> HE DID IT
[1:05:46] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏👏👏👏
[1:05:46] <ChungusQuest> yeyeyeyeye
[1:05:46] <dreadedcthulhu> there ya go

[1:05:47] <+InvertableQuasar> Exactly!
[1:05:47] <+Shonen_hero> you got it!
[1:05:48] <%cylish> HE DID IT!
[1:05:48] <YuriSix_> Hes starting to believe!
[1:05:48] <butthurtdave> YES GOOD WORK
[1:05:48] <ManfredA> you get the bonus but he doesn't
[1:05:48] <$lotharrio> Yes

[1:05:49] <IvanMistwalker> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:05:50] <%TheFabledAble> right, to give YOU the bonus
[1:05:50] <+JJJKopf> HIS BRAIN WORKS
[1:05:51] <MrChaosDoughnut> Yeah!
[1:05:51] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt YEAH ! YOU GOT IT RIGHT!
[1:05:51] <Orenjevel> It'll make sense when you actually gain the teamwork feats
[1:05:51] <%Kyma1020> yes
[1:05:53] <%TheFabledAble> YOU DID IT
[1:05:53] <chaosbringer28> yes
[1:05:53] <%Ghufufin> yay you solved blues clues!
[1:05:54] <dizimous> YEAAAA
[1:05:54] <+tomdwarf> Yes
[1:05:55] <%Agami23> but it only effects inquisitor
[1:05:55] <%AgniBrandt> Correct
[1:05:56] <+Pendragwn> yeah
[1:05:57] <+Double_negative> Atta boy!
[1:05:57] <+transporterthesequel> YEP
[1:05:58] <CappuccinoGuil> LEARNING
[1:05:58] <Sharpevil> SMART BOY
[1:05:59] <butthurtdave> It's very confusing
[1:05:59] <digaogrunge> HE DID IT
[1:06:00] <+Immortalsblade> Yep
[1:06:00] <%Kyma1020> Wording
[1:06:01] <+fetrigon> ⚙️🧠⚙️
[1:06:03] <%rekinom> Do you smell burnt toast?
[1:06:03] <lambishly> Inquisitor is complex dude
[1:06:03] <+Shonen_hero> debuff
[1:06:04] <%TheFabledAble> basically do WAY MORE DMG
[1:06:06] <+nicoleymcquack> it’s for the best pat wasn’t playing this when he had the seagull meltdown
[1:06:07] <%WhereIsWill> hes beginning to believe
[1:06:07] <%Reveresao> I looked at this game and there is just too much text to read. I have no problem reading but look at the length of a singular spell description, way too much.
[1:06:09] <+andreeg24> there's like 50+ years of pathfinder exp in the chat, lol
[1:06:10] <quantras6> @dsd24 that as well, plus I normally like lawful characters
[1:06:10] <ManfredA> monster tacticians have an extra layer where your summoned monsters actually do get your teamwork feats
[1:06:12] <%pokefan9956> YOU'RE A BIG GUY
[1:06:13] <+LazyBumNetwork> U did eet
[1:06:13] <ChungusQuest> RACISM FEAT
[1:06:14] <dreadedcthulhu> reading the card explains the card
[1:06:18] <Talyndemon> You get the bonus.  Teammate does not. You got it.
[1:06:18] <+transporterthesequel> INQUISITORS CHEAT
[1:06:27] <+DerivedKnight> You activate Bane and just point at a particular creature and go 'GET THA MOTHERFUCKER' and you do more damage.
[1:06:27] <kingdinkyI> man pat shouldn't look past 7th level stuff
[1:06:30] <Orenjevel> You figured it out
[1:06:32] <+DeadPhoenix3> bane is great for this game since you will be fighting a lot of demons so you can just set it to 'fucking kill demons' mode
[1:06:34] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt domain selection is PICK A GOD
[1:06:36] <$lotharrio> You have a jesus and you get to choose
[1:06:38] <heartlesshealer> Domain has to do with your God
[1:06:41] <%Ghufufin> you god gives you bonus poiwers
[1:06:42] <+MisterAvry> oh man I missed some of it

[1:06:44] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt domain selection gives you bonus spells also special domain abilities at 1st and 8-10th level
[1:06:44] <+tomdwarf> Basically, what extra spells do you want access to. You get the full list.
[1:06:46] <%CatRidder> good luck
[1:06:46] <%Puhff> Do Sacred HUntsmaster so Geif can be in the game
[1:06:47] <DSD24> @quantras6 So far as a Chaotic Good character I like Wenduag and Ember the most so far
[1:06:47] <+thetunnelhomer> Domains also give you a weapon Inquisitors don't usually get.
[1:06:47] <%Dakuu75> LMFAO~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:06:47] <+transporterthesequel> SECRET BOSS

[1:07:03] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt domain selection is PICK A GODdd
[1:07:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> I assume this will be easier to figure out through the context of the games progression

[1:07:04] <DSD24> Pat Slayer is really good

[1:07:16] <$zyberion626> oh god, Pat no
[1:07:17] <%JoshManVGH> I fucking love pathfinder. It's all about the builds!
[1:07:17] <%chance_h> Congratulations Pat you’ve experienced what it’s like to be Paige. Cheer1000
[1:07:18] <+DerivedKnight> Inquisitor's a great class, especially for a beginner. It's very simple when it comes to Faith Classes.
[1:07:21] <%Questiy> YAY HE GAVE UP

[1:07:31] <CappuccinoGuil> Do you get a party in this? Because if you need to keep this in mind for multiple characters, DEAR FUCKING GOD
[1:07:32] <%Bailey__gaming> what is your luck stat?
[1:07:33] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt Inquisitors don't channel
[1:07:33] <+Shonen_hero> channel energy is a heal

[1:07:55] <%drabberfaun535> Inquisitors HATE goblins
[1:07:59] <kingdinkyI> there is a background that lets you use WIS for persuasion I think
[1:08:01] <%AncelDeLambert> @SSaryn he gets a +2 for Fat Nuts
[1:08:01] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you can make wisdom the stat for persuasion with the "oblate" background. so that you can be persuasive even with dumping charisma
[1:08:03] <Orenjevel> You can use your allies Persuasion on rolls
[1:08:05] <joodatious> lmao
[1:08:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> maximum DORF

[1:08:11] <%bevyrage> all of the feature icons are just taken from the royalty free game icon library
[1:08:15] <%NopeBadguy> Or just base Inquisitor?
[1:08:18] <CappuccinoGuil> @DSD24 fuck off, this is bullshit, I hate this, give me more.

[1:08:51] <JobbedBone> YEYEYEYEEYY
[1:08:53] <+Shockrates20XX> Instead of an exotic weapon
[1:08:57] <+andreeg24> dwarven weapons are exotic to everyone buy dwarves
[1:08:59] <joodatious> passive trait: Race Realism
[1:08:59] <$lotharrio> It goes Simple, Martial, Exotic, in terms of rarity of access.
[1:09:00] <DSD24> Unstoppable Dwarf!
[1:09:03] <%HollowedIdjit> BUT MORE. THERE'S WAIT.
[1:09:04] <%blue8moon> are you basic pat?

[1:09:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> just a simple dorf
[1:09:07] <%Bailey__gaming> unstoppable
[1:09:09] <quantras6> for anyone wondering, A aasimar is basically "Your ancestor fucked a angel once", Oread is rock people, and Dhampir is someone who's parent was a vampire.
[1:09:14] <%Meekest> Hatred lost
[1:09:15] <Brostress> I mean if given the choice I'm going to be Unstoppable

[1:09:23] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:09:25] <$lotharrio> Barrow is pretty good. Not a lot of orcs and gobbos.
[1:09:28] <%NopeBadguy> Barrow could be good for Inquisitor
[1:09:32] <%Meekest> As an inquisitor you may want Barrow
[1:09:34] <Orenjevel> Basic Dwarf
[1:09:37] <%Kyma1020> get barrow

[1:12:18] <+thetunnelhomer> Now you can dump charisma
[1:12:19] <%Questiy> Kill the Demon
[1:12:20] <%Puhff> Wisdom instead of Charisma is strong for Dwarves
[1:12:21] <%RealThiele> sounds like a church
[1:12:22] <+InvertableQuasar> Crank that Charisma into the DIRT
[1:12:22] <%bassoontyphoon> Acolyte good, wires bad
[1:12:22] <+nicoleymcquack> and you never looked back
[1:12:24] <%Bailey__gaming> GOBORIN Srayer
[1:12:25] <Orenjevel> Un-healer
[1:12:26] <+Shonen_hero> wisdom is important as it's your casting stat
[1:12:28] <LoudmicRPG> @PatStaresAt You have been radicalized
[1:12:29] <+LazyBumNetwork> Good call one guy
[1:12:30] <%Ghufufin> NOW FUCKING DUMP CHARISMA AS GOD INTENDED
[1:12:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> Full of Will

[1:12:32] <+TreskM> dump cha
[1:12:33] <%CatRidder> jesus hates the goblins
[1:12:34] <ChungusQuest> Raised by a pack of wild bishops
[1:12:35] <DSD24> Ok we need Wisdom Strenght and Dex
[1:12:37] <+thetunnelhomer> Get you a 5 charisma
[1:12:40] <+DeadPhoenix3> pick str or dex for attacking
[1:12:41] <enreimirai> go 16 wis
[1:12:43] <heartlesshealer> Now wisdom is also giving you your talking skill
[1:12:44] <SolumFuturae> Pog
[1:12:44] <SaltyAzteca> Are goblins the batarians of this game LUL
[1:12:44] <%strugglepunk2> it's also your persuasion because of your background
[1:12:45] <Orenjevel> Hell yeah. Blood for Gorum.
[1:12:46] <+DerivedKnight> NO! DON'T GO TO CAP!
[1:12:47] <+Shonen_hero> yeah :D
[1:12:47] <+MisterAvry> good call
[1:12:48] <%Ghufufin> 20 is a trap
[1:12:49] <%TheFabledAble> HELL YEA DUMP THAT SHIT
[1:12:50] <+andreeg24> do you wanna attack with magic?
[1:12:50] <+InvertableQuasar> YESSSS
[1:12:51] <+DerivedKnight> DON'T GO TO CAP ON WISDOM!
[1:12:51] <+AugustRei> FIVE LOL
[1:12:52] <%lumporr> Ch-ch-cha-risma! (to the tune of ch-ch-ch-chia)
[1:12:53] <+tomdwarf> 20 is stupid high. Go for 16-18
[1:12:54] <deity_majora> All luck
[1:12:54] <enreimirai> legit: go 16 wis
[1:12:54] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:12:55] <MrChaosDoughnut> Go for it!!
[1:12:56] <%Felhad> 18 better
[1:12:56] <Orenjevel> STR is Vital
[1:12:56] <$mattynezz> you only need 16.
[1:12:57] <DSD24> I mean look at your Portriat
[1:12:58] <+thetunnelhomer> 20 is too many points
[1:12:59] <$zyberion626> go to 18
[1:12:59] <+InvertableQuasar> 20 is probably a trap though
[1:12:59] <kingdinkyI> No go to cap
[1:13:00] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:13:00] <+Mrbaconator> 20 is not a trap MIN MAX
[1:13:01] <+Immortalsblade> Don't go to cap
[1:13:02] <%Ghufufin> cap is too expensive
[1:13:03] <+nicoleymcquack> JUST LIKE REAL LIFE
[1:13:04] <+StrikeTheErf> in an hour you'll be saying "fuck why does everyone hate me"
[1:13:04] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt 20 is good youre fine
[1:13:04] <+Shockrates20XX> HES DOING IT HES MIN MAXING
[1:13:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You will get boosts later on, don't put anything to cap.
[1:13:06] <joodatious> stop listening to them pat
[1:13:06] <%TheWinged7> like pat like pat
[1:13:06] <%CatRidder> DAMP CHA, LOTS OF WIS. STR  AND CON
[1:13:06] <enreimirai> all you need is 16 for all your spells, everything after is overkill
[1:13:06] <+pectusumbra> it's a heavy commitment
[1:13:07] <+andreeg24> if you aren't attacking with magic, 16 is best
[1:13:07] <reasonance> very expensive points
[1:13:09] <MrChaosDoughnut> No, get big number
[1:13:09] <%Nekros4442> go to like 18
[1:13:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> INCREASING COSTS
[1:13:10] <+Rofiarf> 18
[1:13:10] <quantras6> He properly would have liked a sacred huntsmaster since he gets a animal companion, and this game had dinosaur pets
[1:13:10] <kingdinkyI> go to cap
[1:13:11] <+JJJKopf> you only need 16 as inquisitor
[1:13:12] <Orenjevel> 16 12 14 10 16 8
[1:13:12] <+InvertableQuasar> Those last few points are very expensive
[1:13:12] <+transporterthesequel> Dex it up too
[1:13:15] <+Immortalsblade> You need Dex
[1:13:18] <heartlesshealer> Point economy
[1:13:19] <%strugglepunk2> points
[1:13:20] <+transporterthesequel> Min charisma
[1:13:20] <%Gogogolem> 18 is fine
[1:13:21] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt Go to Wis cap if you want to be casty, otherwise put more in physical stats
[1:13:21] <%RealThiele> points cost more the higher you go
[1:13:23] <%Ghufufin> loook at the points at the top
[1:13:23] <+DeadPhoenix3> it costs more points to go higher
[1:13:24] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt the higher your spellcasting the harder it is to resist your spell effects
[1:13:24] <Archmortal> it takes MANY POINTS
[1:13:24] <+TreskM> 16 should be enough for wis
[1:13:25] <medoodoo> 18?
[1:13:25] <%Felhad> it takes more points the higher you go
[1:13:26] <Orenjevel> Hell yes
[1:13:27] <reasonance> big strong more better for hit things
[1:13:27] <+DerivedKnight> 16 is Good for Inquisitor and you want to be Melee, right? You need points for that Strength and Con!
[1:13:29] <%shruke> Pathfinder has no cap on skills.
[1:13:31] <%Kyma1020> Point buy
[1:13:32] <+MisterAvry> 18 is good
[1:13:33] <Shad0wSly> this character is statistically accurate
[1:13:33] <%Faustgesicht> 18
[1:13:34] <sendart> Do you plan to use a weapon or just use magic all the time?
[1:13:34] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt DUMP CHARISMA
[1:13:36] <%YakumoYomi> The + is your modifier
[1:13:37] <enreimirai> +1 every 2 points, you get access to all your spells at 16, and your spells are best spent on buffs or support
[1:13:38] <+transporterthesequel> More points the higher you go
[1:13:39] <+thetunnelhomer> You want good STR and Con if you are going frontline
[1:13:39] <Madinki> THE NUMBERS MASON!!!!!
[1:13:40] <chaosbringer28> -10 then divide by 2 determines value of bonus
[1:13:41] <Orenjevel> Its inefficient
[1:13:41] <%Agami23> well, you can use wis instead of cha because of acolyte
[1:13:42] <+GimmMeASammich> 18
[1:13:42] <kingdinkyI> dump CHA
[1:13:42] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt it's a math thing it costs more to go big
[1:13:44] <%strugglepunk2> yo just sack that shit
[1:13:44] <DSD24> Base is 8
[1:13:45] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt base is 10
[1:13:46] <+InvertableQuasar> And you'll want a good dex or str for your weapons. Probably str?
[1:13:49] <Archmortal> 5 Charisma is FINE, because Acolyte uses Wisdom
[1:13:49] <ManfredA> cha is basically worthless for you now
[1:13:50] <%shruke> aim for 18 for your good stats to start
[1:13:50] <%Puhff> 18 for access all spells as Inquistitor
[1:13:52] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt NOOOOOOO
[1:13:54] <%ScreamLord> 18 nerd
[1:13:55] <+thetunnelhomer> You can super dump charisma tho
[1:13:57] <DSD24> You need Dex too
[1:13:59] <+nicoleymcquack> oh god i’ve only ever dm’d for a dnd party and i made shit up because i’m number dyslexic lmao
[1:13:59] <+Shonen_hero> I think what they are saying is that since wisdom is your casting stat, but inquisitors don't get max level spells so it's really only worth getting it to 16
[1:13:59] <count_bob> noooo
[1:14:01] <+kawachipto> it's dnd
[1:14:01] <%strugglepunk2> get some dex
[1:14:02] <%Gogogolem> Rest in Dex
[1:14:03] <%Felhad> 12 or 14 dex
[1:14:04] <Orenjevel> 16 in WIS is fine
[1:14:04] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt Only even numbers count
[1:14:05] <%linSP> dump all and go
[1:14:05] <+MisterAvry> STR is not stab, DEX is stab
[1:14:06] <kingdinkyI> DUMP CHA
[1:14:07] <count_bob> Dex
[1:14:07] <+tomdwarf> Make CHa dump. Keep it at 8.
[1:14:07] <%Nekros4442> just dump charisma
[1:14:08] <%Gogogolem> there you go.
[1:14:09] <%strugglepunk2> that's good honestly
[1:14:09] <%blue8moon> it is important to stab good
[1:14:09] <%Ghufufin> your're good
[1:14:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> Dump CHA
[1:14:10] <enreimirai> I highly recommend 16 str, 12 dex, 16 wis, and the rest in con. Int helps but you dont need it
[1:14:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is fine.
[1:14:11] <%TheDullaMAN> That's good
[1:14:12] <DSD24> Dex means you go faster
[1:14:13] <+andreeg24> we can work with that
[1:14:13] <ManfredA> that looks fine tbh
[1:14:13] <%rekinom> This looks good @PatStaresAt
[1:14:13] <lambishly> PATHFINDER PAT
[1:14:13] <+TreskM> 5 cha imo
[1:14:14] <heartlesshealer> You probably want at least +1 on DEX
[1:14:14] <quantras6> @patstaresat best to keep the numbers even otherwise you don't get a modifier
[1:14:15] <+BedHome> YOU ARE DOING FINE
[1:14:15] <%Ghufufin> this is a good stat line
[1:14:15] <%Gogogolem> perfect
[1:14:16] <%strugglepunk2> no no that's good
[1:14:17] <+MisterAvry> STR is carry shit and HP
[1:14:17] <%Felhad> looks good
[1:14:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> GOOD
[1:14:17] <%TheFabledAble> dump cha and put it in wis

[1:14:37] <$lotharrio> Int controls skill gain.
[1:14:38] <%HolePunchLeaf> man chat kinda unbearable right now

[1:14:52] <$mattynezz> then you could try streaming for a living
[1:14:53] <L3m0nTwi5t> I've only played D&D5E, how much more difficult is this to learn?
[1:14:53] <$zyberion626> INT gives you skill points at level up, don't dump it

[1:15:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'll shout unwarranted encouragement to cancel out all the "noooooo"s
[1:15:15] <+AudacityESQ> Imagine pat being unlikeable WutFace
[1:15:15] <%HollowedIdjit> Honestly this statline is fine
[1:15:15] <%insomniac_doze_> 0 charisma 0 int
[1:15:16] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt do it for big funnies
[1:15:16] <%AncelDeLambert> no but Wisdom tho
[1:15:16] <+MisterAvry> you're making a very interesting character
[1:15:16] <%BoxNavy> u r ogly lole
[1:15:17] <%Ghufufin> pat 5 cha is accurate
[1:15:17] <ManfredA> you literally took the background for that
[1:15:17] <%RealThiele> uneeded
[1:15:17] <%Agami23> since your a acolyte you can use WIS instead of CHA for checks
[1:15:17] <IvanMistwalker> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:15:18] <heartlesshealer> You are using WIS for Talking now
[1:15:18] <+DerivedKnight> You got the Background to use Persuasion as Wisdom so you good! @PatStaresAt
[1:15:18] <+TheDeadpoolDash> all the negatives
[1:15:18] <+transporterthesequel> You need dex for dual wield feats in you want wm
[1:15:18] <%Gogogolem> You don't need it.
[1:15:19] <%TheFabledAble> no because your persuasion is effected by wisdom now
[1:15:20] <sendart> You can use wisdom in place of cha
[1:15:20] <+InvertableQuasar> You use wisdom for persuasion!
[1:15:20] <+tomdwarf> I mean, if you do, you may as well just NOT roll those.
[1:15:20] <$lotharrio> You'll have pretty people around you for talking.
[1:15:20] <Archmortal> you use Wisdom for Persuasion!
[1:15:21] <enreimirai> This is fine, just use wis via that trait
[1:15:21] <Vyskus> FUCK CHA
[1:15:21] <%Faustgesicht> Yeah, you're a Dwarf. Fuck them
[1:15:21] <vVAstrAVv> yes
[1:15:22] <+BigCoffee> Don't worry fuck CHA
[1:15:22] <+glgzephyr> you're already a ugly
[1:15:22] <%Puhff> Ugly but Wise
[1:15:22] <+probably_facetious> You can use WIS for persuasion
[1:15:23] <%MugenSandan> You're roleplaying as yourself aren't you?
[1:15:23] <%Nekros4442> you just have someone else talk for you
[1:15:23] <+Immortalsblade> No, because you got Acolyte
[1:15:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you use wisdom for persuasion
[1:15:24] <%Bailey__gaming> Acolytes negate need for Char
[1:15:24] <+Toshatron> you use WIS for CHA checks
[1:15:24] <+GimmMeASammich> ITS FINE. You can respec later
[1:15:25] <%Meekest> That is fine
[1:15:26] <heartlesshealer> BUT ACOLYTE, PAT

[1:15:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> YES
[1:15:29] <DSD24> That's fine
[1:15:29] <SolumFuturae> Min maxing in pathfinder feels good
[1:15:30] <%Gogogolem> fine
[1:15:30] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you get to increase stats by 1 later
[1:15:31] <%JoshManVGH> that's a solid spread
[1:15:31] <Orenjevel> its *fine*
[1:15:32] <%Ghufufin> odd numbers are fine you get to incerase thme later
[1:15:32] <%ScreamLord> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:15:32] <$zyberion626> it's fine chat
[1:15:33] <%Felhad> odd is fine you get stats from levelups
[1:15:33] <+InvertableQuasar> That is a fine stat line
[1:15:34] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah You did acolyte
[1:15:34] <logothete2401> PAT
[1:15:34] <+andreeg24> make your strength an odd number
[1:15:35] <%AncelDeLambert> embrace scars, defy charm
[1:15:35] <+Tainted_Ninja> it's fine
[1:15:35] <%CatRidder> OTHERCHARCTES MAKE THE DIPLOMACY CHECKS
[1:15:35] <%Puhff> 18 wisdom
[1:15:36] <+fetrigon> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:15:36] <+MisterAvry> Odd number is okay, you get free points later
[1:15:37] <+AugustRei> put it in int
[1:15:37] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt your "Acolyte" thing said it'd use Wis instead of CHR for perssuasions
[1:15:38] <heartlesshealer> this is fine
[1:15:38] <masheshardest> int
[1:15:38] <$zyberion626> 8 CHA is fine
[1:15:38] <%bread_assassin> You use Wisdom for Persuasion so Charisma is less useful.
[1:15:38] <BigYanno> MINMAX YOU COWARD
[1:15:38] <%strugglepunk2> bump up int
[1:15:38] <vVAstrAVv> you will NEVER get layed
[1:15:39] <%komradedog> dump int
[1:15:40] <Vyskus> Odd Number is easier to level up
[1:15:40] <+glgzephyr> pump INT
[1:15:40] <%RealThiele> lvl 4 is stat boost t0o make even
[1:15:42] <enreimirai> Every 4 levels you get +1 to a stat
[1:15:42] <+Immortalsblade> You got Acolyte so it doesn't matter
[1:15:43] <+kawachipto> you use ur party to fill the gaps
[1:15:43] <%Ghufufin> wis
[1:15:43] <+fetrigon> VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay
[1:15:44] <+nicoleymcquack> why chat when you can throw hands and be wise
[1:15:45] <%Puhff> 18 WISDOM
[1:15:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> ACOLYTE HAS WISDOM PERSUASION
[1:15:46] <Orenjevel> You dont use it for anything now that your Persuasion scales on WIS
[1:15:46] <+MisterAvry> Plan for that yeah
[1:15:46] <+DerivedKnight> Put that in Strength!
[1:15:47] <%peyodogo> keep charisma big you know you want to
[1:15:47] <%TheDullaMAN> It'd be WIS
[1:15:48] <%Felhad> 17 WIS
[1:15:48] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt you will be permanently stuck with an odd number later if you don't do it now
[1:15:48] <%Ghufufin> you always bump your wis
[1:15:50] <+HellCopter> Odd numbers are okay when going down
[1:15:50] <+Wegochrome> STR
[1:15:50] <@Ranryu692> stength
[1:15:51] <ManfredA> WIS tbh
[1:15:51] <$zyberion626> Stangth?
[1:15:51] <%logoth_> Stength
[1:15:51] <%lumporr> wooo! yeah! let's be universally reviled!
[1:15:52] <quantras6> @patstaresat every 4th level you get a extra attribute point
[1:15:52] <%lucky_icarus> Wis
[1:15:53] <%SpoonheadInExile> STENKTH???
[1:15:53] <butthurtdave> Odds are okay, you get your first bonus attribute point at 4 IIRC
[1:15:54] <heartlesshealer> Then throw up INT for skill points idk
[1:15:54] <%Nekros4442> strength
[1:15:54] <notsoy> inquisitor definitely seems like something that needs charisma though?
[1:15:54] <+DeadPhoenix3> STR
[1:15:54] <+thetunnelhomer> Up to you
[1:15:54] <dreadedcthulhu> whizz
[1:15:55] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat Acolyte negates need for change,
[1:15:55] <%Meekest> Go 18 WIS
[1:15:56] <+transporterthesequel> Too much Con btw unless you plan to melee
[1:15:57] <%RealThiele> STR
[1:15:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> that just means it's easier to get the next proficiency point when you level
[1:15:57] <+andreeg24> you get to increase stats ever 4 levels.  so 1 at 4,8,12,16,20
[1:15:57] <%TheFabledAble> ye
[1:15:59] <clintlickr> holy shit is that Pat?

[1:16:12] <+AudacityESQ> Put everything in Strenf

[1:16:37] <%CatRidder> LOWER YOUR INT
[1:16:38] <Vyskus> You'll be wearing heavier armor probably so dex shouldn't be higher than like 14
[1:16:39] <+kawachipto> wtf this chat has no idea how the game works
[1:16:39] <+DerivedKnight> No! You had it fine earlier! 17 Strength, 16 Con and Wis, 14 Dex, 10 Int, 5 Cha!

[1:18:45] <heartlesshealer> I hate that Perception is on THIS SCREEN
[1:18:48] <%YakumoYomi> More dialogue options at times
[1:18:48] <butthurtdave> Usually just for skill checks in the environment
[1:18:49] <+Pendragwn> NOTHING
[1:18:49] <%Piemono> Skill checks for Convo's and world interaction
[1:18:51] <+transporterthesequel> 10 minutes till enrage.
[1:18:52] <%JoshManVGH> Let you make checks
[1:18:52] <%newtype89> perseption , athletics, mobilaty
[1:18:53] <$zyberion626> @PatStaresAt pick one knowledge, persuasion and mobility
[1:18:54] <+JJJKopf> it's mostly for skill checks
[1:18:55] <Talyndemon> knowledge on monsters and how to bop em
[1:18:56] <huskarl_zap> damn 3.5 lost alot of skills
[1:18:59] <+Fonarios> CHOOSE YOUR NUMBERS GOBLIN MAN

[1:19:05] <quantras6> @patstaresat skill checks, magic device is mainly using stuff like scrolls
[1:19:05] <+MisterAvry> Definitely Perception
[1:19:05] <+AugustRei> that skill is godlike
[1:19:07] <%Felhad> put points in everything that already has good number
[1:19:07] <%darklordfodder> get better at perception
[1:19:07] <%Faustgesicht> What's an Inquistor? Like a paladin?
[1:19:08] <+TreskM> Percption for sure
[1:19:09] <+InvertableQuasar> You definitely want to put one in perception
[1:19:10] <MrPandastic> Welcome to DnD character creation. This shit can take an entire day sometimes.
[1:19:11] <+Rofiarf> the first points gives 4 for class skills
[1:19:15] <%Ghufufin> Pathfinder rewards specialization
[1:19:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> Your Class Skills get a +3 as long as you put 1 point in them.
[1:19:16] <%RealThiele> perceive harder
[1:19:17] <%Questiy> MAKE BIG BIGGERER
[1:19:18] <Orenjevel> Monster ID
[1:19:19] <+MisterAvry> always be Percepting
[1:19:19] <+DerivedKnight> @huskarl_zap They lowered the skills down to make it easy for the game.
[1:19:19] <enreimirai> Lore: religion is demons, aka the main enemy type.
[1:19:19] <Vyskus> you can only put 1 point in each
[1:19:20] <+BigCoffee> Perception and religion
[1:19:20] <%laserbeaming> Pick both Lores
[1:19:20] <Archmortal> Max Rank 1
[1:19:22] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you want to play to your strengths
[1:19:22] <+TheDeadpoolDash> Wow, it is just like a Pathfinder character sheet.
[1:19:23] <+Phantomjay> you can see this screen doing damage to pat
[1:19:24] <%Gogogolem> YEs
[1:19:25] <%Piemono> Guys he can only put 1 point into each atm
[1:19:26] <%sandrews> Lore is encyclopedia about that subject
[1:19:27] <$realm_forge> The joke is that the character creation is the final boss
[1:19:29] <%TheFabledAble> nice
[1:19:29] <+tomdwarf> @huskarl_zap This is incredibly simple, actually. The game must have removed a lot of Pathfinders base skills.
[1:19:30] <kingdinkyI> you need to beef those numbers
[1:19:31] <DSD24> @Faustgesicht Nah he's like a Cleric with specific Judgement spells
[1:19:31] <+BigCoffee> pescuation too
[1:19:34] <%TheFabledAble> correct
[1:19:34] <SolumFuturae> +10 Kreygasm

[1:19:36] <%strugglepunk2> Persuasion!
[1:19:37] <+Immortalsblade> Up perception, and persuasion
[1:19:38] <Orenjevel> Bump the highest ones
[1:19:39] <%Nekros4442> perception too
[1:19:39] <quantras6> Lore in religion is appropriate seeing as you're a Inquisitor
[1:19:40] <+Shonen_hero> persuasion is the next one you wanna beef up
[1:19:40] <%AncelDeLambert> Patwarf is now confirmed as Catholic
[1:19:41] <%darklordfodder> God that perception mod is crazy
[1:19:42] <+AudacityESQ> LUL
[1:19:42] <%RealThiele> Jesus will rat out undead monsters for you
[1:19:44] <$mattynezz> perception and persuasion, and then whatever you want, because the party can do the rest
[1:19:46] <+MisterAvry> Beefy 10 Perception yeahhhh
[1:19:46] <%SpoonheadInExile> So'ama'bihfit
[1:19:46] <DSD24> Athletics is good
[1:19:46] <+transporterthesequel> Yeeyeye
[1:19:47] <heartlesshealer> persuasion is fine too because acolyte
[1:19:50] <+LazyBumNetwork> Dang son.
[1:19:53] <+Shonen_hero> hey, it completely makes up for you ugliness
[1:19:55] <%Agami23> but you have bad charisma, how talk good?
[1:19:56] <%MightyDuckShoes> I'm gonna go play Neverwinter Nights. scratch that itch in my plums
[1:19:56] <CappuccinoGuil> Nothing escapes the Dwarf Eye
[1:19:58] <%blue8moon> hated by all, but good at talking LUL
[1:19:58] <$lotharrio> Mobility lets you avoid when enemies try to get free hits in.
[1:19:59] <%Felhad> mobility good too
[1:19:59] <+HellCopter> Where's Tumble tho the most important skill
[1:20:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> mobility?
[1:20:01] <%TheFabledAble> athletics is used a lot as is mobility or take nature
[1:20:03] <butthurtdave> Remember that you'll have a full party that can do the rest of the checks for you
[1:20:03] <%Gogogolem> I'd take stealth
[1:20:05] <+pectusumbra> perception for sure, note
[1:20:06] <Orenjevel> Perception is a god stat
[1:20:06] <DSD24> Mobility is good too
[1:20:08] <%Eaglestrike117> Go with Arcana
[1:20:09] <%TheDullaMAN> Mobility
[1:20:10] <%Felhad> mobility
[1:20:10] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can be really good in nature as well
[1:20:10] <%strugglepunk2> I'd go arcana or world
[1:20:12] <%Nekros4442> @agami23 he uses wisdom to talk
[1:20:12] <%lumporr> why talk good when your face looks like a plastic sack of steak
[1:20:13] <%RealThiele> sneaky?
[1:20:15] <+Shonen_hero> trickery is your lockpick and remove trap skill
[1:20:16] <+LazyBumNetwork> Used wis in place of cha lmao
[1:20:16] <+GimmMeASammich> MOB
[1:20:16] <%laserbeaming> Lore (Nature) because no one has it.
[1:20:17] <$zyberion626> @Agami23 his background allows him to use WIS for persuasion
[1:20:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah
[1:20:18] <%Monkeyweed21> mobility
[1:20:18] <%Meekest> World Knowledge?
[1:20:19] <+pectusumbra> @Agami23 A background lets him sub wis for persuade
[1:20:19] <dybia> Perception is good to have for spotting traps and special loot
[1:20:20] <%Felhad> do mobility
[1:20:24] <butthurtdave> Mobility
[1:20:24] <+thetunnelhomer> Trickery is open locks btw
[1:20:25] <+MisterAvry> jumping over shit and stuff right?
[1:20:30] <cheapdoc> He beat the class goblins?
[1:20:30] <Orenjevel> Ath Mob Lore(R) Perc Pers
[1:20:31] <%Faustgesicht> Arcana is Always handy
[1:20:32] <chaosbringer28> pat be aware, anything that says trained only, can only be used if you have a skill point in it
[1:20:32] <kingdinkyI> Arcana to identify
[1:20:35] <%Felhad> mobility
[1:20:36] <butthurtdave> Mobility is important for combat
[1:20:37] <%Agami23> oh i didnt know it would work for that
[1:20:38] <+transporterthesequel> Now your in the flavor zone
[1:20:41] <+Shonen_hero> just put one point in
[1:20:41] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you immedietly get a companion with high trickery
[1:20:41] <vVAstrAVv> i see an odd number
[1:20:42] <+LazyBumNetwork> You get no armor movement penalty
[1:20:42] <Vyskus> I'm sure you'll get a rogue party member
[1:20:44] <signofzeta> you get party members that get trickery
[1:20:45] <+AugustRei> your companions will do trickery way better
[1:20:46] <+transporterthesequel> Pick whatever
[1:20:46] <%Nekros4442> you dont need trickery
[1:20:49] <quantras6> @patstaresat other companions can cover your shortcomings
[1:20:50] <%Piemono> Plenty of Party members can get into trickery
[1:20:50] <butthurtdave> You'll have other party members for lock picking and trapping
[1:20:51] <+GimmMeASammich> Your party will be able to
[1:20:52] <kingdinkyI> You are trained in anything
[1:20:54] <%strugglepunk2> you never get a lock without a party
[1:20:55] <+nicoleymcquack> he’s to short to reach locks it’s no big deal
[1:20:56] <DSD24> You do get a Trickery buddy
[1:20:56] <Orenjevel> Your dex is good enough for lighter armors
[1:21:00] <+pectusumbra> next to the name of the skill top center of screen
[1:21:00] <TheLocalRival> It’s kinda scary how similar the character portrait looks like Pat Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:21:03] <chaosbringer28> check lore skills for example
[1:21:05] <digaogrunge> LOOK AT TOP
[1:21:10] <quantras6> @vyskus one of the first you get after the tutorial area is a rouge tiefling
[1:21:10] <+TreskM> nature imo
[1:21:11] <+JJJKopf> you can't have 0 trickery and pick locks etc
[1:21:12] <+GimmMeASammich> It always takes the highest from your Party @PatStaresAt
[1:21:15] <heartlesshealer> Trickery means you can't even try unless you put a point in
[1:21:16] <DSD24> This music is great btw
[1:21:18] <%rekinom> I'd recommend mobility
[1:21:18] <Orenjevel> You get two teammates who are great at lockpicking
[1:21:18] <+MisterAvry> you need a glass of water Pat
[1:21:20] <%TheFabledAble> you immedietly get a companion with high trickery so dont worry about that, take nature or mobility would be my reccomend
[1:21:20] <+thetunnelhomer> Also this game has infinite free respecs so you can change whenever
[1:21:21] <%Gogogolem> you're a dwarf you know about rocks
[1:21:21] <%Meekest> You like Nature already
[1:21:21] <+DeadPhoenix3> nature lore sacles with wisdom so its good for you
[1:21:22] <dreadedcthulhu> decision paralysis is real asf
[1:21:26] <enreimirai> When in doubt grab lore or knowledge
[1:21:28] <vVAstrAVv> cover the short
[1:21:28] <kingdinkyI> Be good at what you're good at and suck at everything else
[1:21:28] <EasternEagle21> So the joy of this stream is just watching Pat's mind melt right?
[1:21:31] <%baka_sugoi> how far we into build?
[1:21:31] <%RealThiele> so this guy even with shitty cha is the party spotter and face
[1:21:32] <+DerivedKnight> @PatStaresAt Always remember, what you don't pick up on your main character you have party characters to back you up in! So pick things you want and you're good!
[1:21:34] <+Rofiarf> only the first point
[1:21:36] <+AugustRei> that's lookin good
[1:21:36] <fairore> panicking already pat
[1:21:39] <%strugglepunk2> class skill
[1:21:39] <%redthebaron> class skill
[1:21:39] <+BigCoffee> +3 for first rnak
[1:21:40] <lambishly> Class Skill
[1:21:40] <butthurtdave> @PatStaresAt  Mobility is important for combat
[1:21:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> They were all like that
[1:21:41] <%kingmemelord97> !uptime
[1:21:41] <+andreeg24> +3 because it's a class skill
[1:21:42] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 22m.
[1:21:43] <@GeneralSCPatton> At top. "Trained Only" means you can't attempt it without any points.
[1:21:44] <+Rofiarf> class skill gets bonus 3 when you level them
[1:21:44] <%darklordfodder> class skill bonus
[1:21:45] <+DeadPhoenix3> class skills get +3 if you have 1 rank in them
[1:21:46] <+AudacityESQ> HypeOoh *heavy panting*
[1:21:46] <$zyberion626> your first point gives you +4 if your proficient
[1:21:46] <$lotharrio> Class skills get a big boost the first time you put points in.
[1:21:47] <enreimirai> You get +3 for it being a class skill if you invest ANYTHING
[1:21:47] <%Ghufufin> +1 from rank and +3 from class bonus
[1:21:48] <%Meekest> Looks good
[1:21:49] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt hell yea. you have the green check for proficiency which doubles the initial bonus to increasing it
[1:21:49] <ManfredA> arcana lets you identify items
[1:21:49] <%Sotetsu> Inquisitor! Pat stares at witchcraft!
[1:21:50] <+JJJKopf> it's the first point in a class skill
[1:21:50] <+DerivedKnight> Pathfinder gives you a +3 bonus for your first point invested into a skill. You good!
[1:21:51] <%laserbeaming> You get +4 from putting the first point in a Class Skill
[1:21:51] <%AncelDeLambert> wow it's almost like knowing something lets you know something
[1:21:52] <DSD24> @RealThiele That's the power of backgrounds
[1:21:53] <+MisterAvry> +1 for the point, +3 for it being a class skill
[1:21:53] <+Shonen_hero> cause you get boosts when you put a rank in because that means you are trained in your class skill
[1:21:53] <Archmortal> because the big boosts are from things that can only be used when trained
[1:21:54] <heartlesshealer> +4 for putting a point in
[1:21:56] <+AugustRei> POWER ATTACK
[1:21:57] <%RealThiele> +3 for in calss skill after first point taken
[1:21:58] <%redthebaron> IT NEVER ENDS
[1:21:58] <chaosbringer28> class skill, any skill you put a point in that is a class skills gets a free +3
[1:21:59] <Vyskus> It never stops lmao
[1:22:00] <+thetunnelhomer> Heavy armor is good for melee
[1:22:00] <enreimirai> Grab armor proficiency heavy and you can use platemail
[1:22:02] <Calek> is Pat dying
[1:22:02] <+BedHome> ahahahahahaaha
[1:22:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> Class Skills get +3 for having any points in it.
[1:22:03] <+InvertableQuasar> Ah fuck he has to pick a feat
[1:22:03] <masheshardest> oh shit the feat tree is the real final boss
[1:22:04] <quantras6> Feats are basically perks
[1:22:04] <+DeadPhoenix3> do you want to hit things or shoot them?
[1:22:05] <$lotharrio> Better sneak attacks
[1:22:07] <yousomuch_> character creation is always super fun : )
[1:22:07] <+Immortalsblade> These are feats
[1:22:07] <+transporterthesequel> FINAL BOSS INCOMING
[1:22:08] <%darklordfodder> Power Attack
[1:22:08] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no, feats

[1:22:09] <CruxAustralis> PICK POINT BLANK SHOT
[1:22:11] <+DerivedKnight> @PatStaresAt Pick up Power Attack! It's the go to Melee Damage Feat
[1:22:11] <CappuccinoGuil> YOU GOT THIS
[1:22:12] <SolumFuturae> is inquisitor a ranged class?
[1:22:12] <SilverFaustX> theres a star trek convention on twitch
[1:22:12] <%Nekros4442> this should just be armor or power strike
[1:22:14] <Treasure_Vault> Man this spreadsheet looks really cool
[1:22:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> we will get to the game someday I think
[1:22:14] <+Rofiarf> blind fight is good
[1:22:14] <%castlerock42> Now it breaks Pat.

[1:22:31] <%NateyBeak> pat "I want to play dnd I'm sure it'll be fun" Boyvan
[1:22:31] <pacibuddy> this is the best
[1:22:31] <+Immortalsblade> You want heavy armour cause you don't have much DEX
[1:22:33] <+DerivedKnight> @SolumFuturae Inquisitor can be Melee or Ranged.
[1:22:34] <Treasure_Vault> I know about scary shit, yo
[1:22:35] <+fetrigon> jesus fuck NotLikeThis
[1:22:38] <Orenjevel> Just pick power attack its the only way
[1:22:39] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> welcome to the Pathfinder Feat List
[1:22:40] <%Felhad> just pick power attack
[1:22:40] <+thetunnelhomer> Heavy armor or Power Strike is good
[1:22:42] <+transporterthesequel> ASK QUESTIONS, what do you want to do here man
[1:22:42] <%darklordfodder> Combat Casting
[1:22:45] <+AugustRei> the feat recommendations are bizarre
[1:22:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Maybe because this UI is garbage in terms of usability
[1:22:47] <+BigCoffee> Pat ffs
[1:22:47] <+MisterAvry> Later
[1:22:49] <+Shonen_hero> cause a lot of those feats for class specific stuff
[1:22:49] <%Sotetsu> Pat, you're doing it!
[1:22:50] <heartlesshealer> oh that's where it is
[1:22:52] <+tomdwarf> Its letting you show what you could work towards.
[1:22:53] <+MisterAvry> you can get them later
[1:22:53] <butthurtdave> It doesn't know what build you're trying to do Pat so if offers the best choice based on class
[1:22:54] <+InvertableQuasar> Do you want to be melee or ranged?
[1:22:55] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt just get dodge
[1:22:55] <%JoshManVGH> Not cool enough for that shit... YET
[1:22:55] <+Rofiarf> ignore the hands
[1:22:55] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a TERRIBLE menu
[1:22:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> Combat Casting
[1:22:57] <%Eaglestrike117> Pick power attack
[1:22:57] <SolumFuturae> @DerivedKnight what does it favor though?
[1:22:57] <%Ghufufin> power attack for big meaty hits
[1:22:58] <CruxAustralis> pbs is great
[1:22:58] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt Imma help you out here, take combat casting or improved initiative to start. when you know your class better you can specialize more
[1:22:59] <%RealThiele> power attack or point blank shot
[1:23:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Just pick the thumbs up and move on
[1:23:01] <%lumporr> melting ice cream behind a window
[1:23:02] <%Nekros4442> power strike, combat casting armor proficiency are all good
[1:23:02] <quantras6> Inqisitors tend to use a bow or crossbow iirc, though they can do fine with a melee weapon
[1:23:03] <ManfredA> point blank shot is good
[1:23:03] <chaosbringer28> its just showing you the full feat list,
[1:23:03] <%strugglepunk2> combat casting seems pretty good
[1:23:04] <+Immortalsblade> Get heavy armour
[1:23:04] <+AudacityESQ> Gonna get up to get snacks, anyone want snacks?
[1:23:07] <%Sotetsu> It's so you can plan ahead.
[1:23:08] <+MisterAvry> This should be a tree so it makes more sense
[1:23:08] <gyde42> DnD 5e is so much better
[1:23:09] <+Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt left click them to make the description of them stay
[1:23:11] <+InvertableQuasar> If you want to be ranged pick point blank shot
[1:23:12] <$mattynezz> pick weapon focus for the weapon you want. that's the most important feat right now, everything else can wait
[1:23:12] <%redthebaron> become the all seeing eye
[1:23:13] <%TheWinged7> so tonights stream is JUST going to be character creation isnt it?
[1:23:13] <+pectusumbra> tough never hurts
[1:23:14] <$zyberion626> point blank shot if you want to pew pew
[1:23:15] <%RealThiele> you want range or melee pat?
[1:23:15] <+thetunnelhomer> That's a good one
[1:23:18] <%TheFabledAble> no
[1:23:19] <digaogrunge> COMBAT CASTING EZ
[1:23:21] <%sw_paladin> Heavy armor imo
[1:23:21] <enreimirai> So pat. I HIGHLY recommend armor proficiency: heavy.
[1:23:22] <%Agami23> doesent dwarf ignore armor?
[1:23:23] <heartlesshealer> your character does not seem a bow man, so maybe Blind Fight
[1:23:25] <BitOSalt> i mean... you cant just smoosh it all together. there are limitations
[1:23:26] <%Nekros4442> you specifically sont
[1:23:26] <+Immortalsblade> You have high strength so you want heavy armour
[1:23:27] <+Kduff89> giefs in the game? Pog
[1:23:29] <+thetunnelhomer> You only get a animal companion if you go Huntsmaster
[1:23:29] <%TheFabledAble> NO
[1:23:29] <+MisterAvry> a Prerequisites Tree would be good
[1:23:30] <+Shonen_hero> yeah
[1:23:30] <$zyberion626> @PatStaresAt improved initiative is always a solid pic
[1:23:31] <austinj24> COMBAT CAST
[1:23:32] <kingdinkyI> no don't it tanks your fuckign mobility
[1:23:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> COMBAT CASTING
[1:23:33] <+TreskM> Dodge is always good
[1:23:34] <%darklordfodder> Combat Casting
[1:23:34] <lambishly> You spent points on dex don't do heavy armor @PatStaresAt
[1:23:35] <%laserbeaming> Those are good choices
[1:23:36] <+Shonen_hero> power attack is a good choice
[1:23:37] <%JoshManVGH> Heavy Armor proficiency would negate your points spent in DEX
[1:23:38] <@GeneralSCPatton> Combat Casting
[1:23:39] <%TheFabledAble> dont take poer this early
[1:23:40] <Archmortal> Heavy Armor is good cuz you'll never get slower
[1:23:41] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt seriously pick Point Blank or you are going to hate yourself
[1:23:42] <enreimirai> dorf doesnt get speed penalties so yeah, dorfs want the heavy armor.
[1:23:44] <+InvertableQuasar> If you want to be melee power attack, if you want to be ranged point blank shot
[1:23:44] <chaosbringer28> its going to depend if you are melee man, or ranged man
[1:23:44] <+andreeg24> you don't have enough attack to get power attack.  you can get it later.
[1:23:44] <+Shonen_hero> it opens you up to certain feat progression paths
[1:23:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> yo ironguts
[1:23:45] <huskarl_zap> plus 2 int really that useful?
[1:23:50] <Orenjevel> Power Attack or Heavy Armor are good choices
[1:23:51] <+DeadPhoenix3> inqusitor initative is already good IIRC
[1:23:51] <DSD24> Initiative is always good
[1:23:54] <%RealThiele> power attack fucks, imp. init meh
[1:24:01] <Orenjevel> You do not have an animal companion by default
[1:24:01] <%ahomeschooldropout> COMBAT CAST
[1:24:04] <lord_sykos> lower accuracy, higher damage
[1:24:05] <%JoshManVGH> Combat Casting is probably what you want as a front line cleric type
[1:24:06] <+nicoleymcquack> i guess this is why they have pre made characters, this is a lot
[1:24:07] <+DerivedKnight> Take Power Attack for more Melee Damage later on!
[1:24:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> smack em harder
[1:24:09] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt Imma help you out here, take combat casting or improved initiative to start. then branch out when you know your class better. power attack is good but you miss more regularly
[1:24:10] <austinj24> COMBAT CAST
[1:24:20] <+transporterthesequel> @patstaresat do you want to range or melee? say so on stream so chat can focus.
[1:24:20] <enreimirai> Power attack isnt that good for inquisitors. You really on bane for damage anyways, and your accuracy is mediocre.
[1:24:20] <Orenjevel> Ignore Metamagic for now
[1:24:22] <DSD24> That sounds really good
[1:24:24] <+BigCoffee> combat cast good
[1:24:27] <SolumFuturae> @gyde42 I prefer being able to build something unique in other systems than having 5e's psudo specialities that still easily fail skill checks you are supposed to be specialized in
[1:24:27] <quantras6> @patstaresat one of the Inquisitor sub classes would give you a animal companion (sacred huntsmaster) but you'd have to give up another ability, I think your judgements
[1:24:27] <%Questiy> Cornugon OP
[1:24:28] <%Agami23> thats pretty good
[1:24:28] <Vyskus> Concentration is for when you get punched while using a spell
[1:24:28] <+thetunnelhomer> Combat casting is more for magic based guys
[1:24:29] <+pectusumbra> that's not a bad one either
[1:24:31] <amonimis> can never go wrong with improved initiative
[1:24:31] <shockmaster3> is he playing a priest?
[1:24:33] <+Shonen_hero> yeah cause if you get fucked up you burn a spell
[1:24:34] <%JoshManVGH> If you're gonna be in the front your gonna be fucked up
[1:24:34] <%TheFabledAble> yup
[1:24:34] <%redthebaron> that is good
[1:24:34] <butthurtdave> YOu can always respecc later Pat
[1:24:34] <%Gogogolem> yes
[1:24:36] <Fnir> No interrupts
[1:24:36] <+MisterAvry> +4 is huge
[1:24:36] <%Monkeyweed21> do you want to focus on melee or ranged attacks
[1:24:37] <+TheDeadpoolDash> Power Attack is always good since it leads to other stuff.
[1:24:37] <+JJJKopf> dodge is a free +1 to defense
[1:24:39] <heartlesshealer> yeah if you get surrounded that's great
[1:24:39] <%ahomeschooldropout> You get more feats as you level btw

[1:25:23] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt torag is the dwarf god and favored weapon just means you can use it

[1:26:00] <chaosbringer28> dwarf
[1:26:01] <$lotharrio> Dwarf race
[1:26:01] <Archmortal> you kinda wanna just use Dwarven weapons anyway because you're just good with them
[1:26:01] <%JoshManVGH> Dwarf probably
[1:26:01] <+TheDeadpoolDash> There should be a Dwarven god that get you Warhammer.
[1:26:02] <%AncelDeLambert> that was your Dwarf trait
[1:26:02] <+BigCoffee> and tyou have dwarf weapons
[1:26:02] <%RealThiele> simple and dwarf weapons
[1:26:02] <%TheDullaMAN> That's your Dwarven proficiency
[1:26:02] <signofzeta> dwarves get a bunch of axes
[1:26:02] <$mattynezz> weapon focus is the most important feat right now. it will just let you hit things which you need
[1:26:03] <+andreeg24> simple weapon, martial weapon, exotic weapon
[1:26:04] <+transporterthesequel> @patstaresat means you can use the weapon without penalties even if you don’t know how to use it.
[1:26:06] <+Immortalsblade> Yeah dwarf
[1:26:06] <+pectusumbra> dwarf gives you all dwarf weapons as well
[1:26:07] <%MugenSandan> Only if it's Dwarven
[1:26:07] <heartlesshealer> Dwarf Weapons
[1:26:07] <+JJJKopf> dwarf weapons because dorf
[1:26:09] <@Jekado> you get simple and dwarf racial weapons
[1:26:10] <quantras6> @patstaresat being a dwarf makes you good at dwarf specific weapons
[1:26:11] <%sw_paladin> Dwarf weapon
[1:26:12] <%Monkeyweed21> dwarf weapons are better on you
[1:26:12] <zerointelligence000> dwarfs make dwarven weapons martial
[1:26:12] <+thetunnelhomer> So you get axes and hammers
[1:26:12] <%Gogogolem> Thats only weapons with Dwarf in the name
[1:26:15] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt dwarf lets you take dwarf weapons (but only if you get martial weapon proficiency)
[1:26:16] <%Treuan> dorf
[1:26:17] <%Nekros4442> choose torag
[1:26:17] <%baka_sugoi> D W A R F
[1:26:18] <+DerivedKnight> No. Dwarves can use Dwarf weapons for free, and then you can use the weapon of your God as an Inquisitor
[1:26:18] <+transporterthesequel> Dwarf racial
[1:26:20] <digaogrunge> DORFS ARE GOOD WITH MARTIAL
[1:26:20] <+Rofiarf> Deity really doesn't matter that much
[1:26:21] <%shruke> you can use weapon with dwarf in the name
[1:26:21] <+BigCoffee> Pharasma is goddes of fuck undead
[1:26:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Any weapon with "dwarven" in its name you can use.
[1:26:22] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt pick atheist
[1:26:25] <+MisterAvry> Gorum is a good dorf god
[1:26:27] <DSD24> Also this assigns what Alighment you can be
[1:26:28] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt so a god that has favored weapons for like battleaxes is good
[1:26:28] <FatherGreyBeard> Simple Weapons and Battleaxes and Warhammers. Weapons with Dwarf in the name are Martial weapons, rather than Exotic.
[1:26:29] <heartlesshealer> Simple Weapons + Dwarf Weapons + God Favored Weapon
[1:26:29] <%TheFabledAble> torag is the dwarf deity
[1:26:30] <+Shonen_hero> Torag is the dwarf god
[1:26:31] <+MisterAvry> or yeah Torag
[1:26:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait you treat dwarven weapons as martial but you don't have martial proficiency
[1:26:33] <%SpoonheadInExile> Pat I hope Woolie gives you such shit about this AND the Seagulls

[1:29:16] <elwynnster> In hindsight, maybe you should have picked fighter.
[1:29:17] <%alternative_flu> did sombody say C H A O S
[1:29:17] <+Pendragwn> CHAOS
[1:29:17] <Kain5707> Chaos Legion? @PatStaresAt

[1:29:24] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> CHAOS FUCKED MY SISTER
[1:29:25] <%saadi90> Gotta kill CHAOS
[1:29:25] <%Faustgesicht> Welcome to dnd. Now imagine doing this along 4 other players
[1:29:27] <%chance_h> Turns out the true boss is the character creator
[1:29:30] <%Monkeyweed21> CHAOS ZWEIHANDER +10
[1:29:30] <%HollowedIdjit> wait which God did he pick
[1:29:30] <AzureGale> Chaos does a lot of volunteer work and makes a big impact in his community
[1:29:35] <UberKingKai> kzxChaos kzxChaos kzxChaos kzxChaos kzxChaos
[1:29:36] <DSD24> Glory is really good
[1:29:37] <dukenux> Are you CHAOS?
[1:29:40] <Talyndemon> Look at it this way.  You have made a Pathfinder character sheet.   You're ready if the real thing ever corners you!
[1:29:44] <medoodoo> WHY DOES HE SAY DESTRUCTION LIKE THAT
[1:29:46] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Undead HATE this one weird trick
[1:29:47] <shockmaster3> yo thats good
[1:29:49] <medoodoo> DESTRUKSHYUN
[1:29:50] <notsoy> remember your charisma is shit
[1:29:50] <+MisterAvry> probably gonna see a fair amount of undead in this game
[1:29:51] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt destruction or glory would be my picks. Destruction basically gives you dmg buff. glory gives you an aura that makes all your allies and you better
[1:29:56] <dybia> These only matter because you picked a religious class for a religious character
[1:30:02] <+MisterAvry> that's good
[1:30:06] <AzureGale> Chaos downloaded dolphin porn onto my laptop, that's how come it's on there
[1:30:07] <+MisterAvry> For Glory
[1:30:08] <shockmaster3> pat how did you play Baldur's gate
[1:30:09] <%Gogogolem> Glory or War.
[1:30:09] <+glgzephyr> uh oh he dumped CHA LUL
[1:30:10] <yousomuch_> there's so much reading! : 0
[1:30:12] <DSD24> Nah you Wisdom for it
[1:30:13] <+HellCopter> Destruction or Glory. Damage or support
[1:30:13] <+pectusumbra> so you can buff your face characters and let them sparkle
[1:30:13] <%bevyrage> you can use this on yourself
[1:30:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> harny
[1:30:15] <Calek> make your charisma better
[1:30:15] <+BigCoffee> check str
[1:30:15] <%YakumoYomi> Harny
[1:30:16] <%rekinom> the bonus is based on your class level, not your charisma
[1:30:16] <medoodoo> HARNEY?
[1:30:18] <%TheDullaMAN> Harny
[1:30:19] <Sharpevil> It makes your friends with good charisma have better charisma
[1:30:19] <+fetrigon> harney
[1:30:20] <Vyskus> This is so fuckin funny lmao
[1:30:20] <IvanMistwalker> War
[1:30:20] <+Immortalsblade> You fight so much undead in this game
[1:30:21] <Archmortal> it's based on YOUR LEVEL, to help SOMEONE ELSE'S Charisma
[1:30:21] <+Aullama> Harney KKona
[1:30:22] <shockmaster3> were you about to say "thank you harlot"
[1:30:23] <Memitim> You use wisdom for persuasion
[1:30:24] <ManfredA> you cha doesn't matter, your character level does
[1:30:25] <FatherGreyBeard> The boost is based on your  Level not your Charisma
[1:30:26] <maybefalco> harny
[1:30:26] <%GinAndRoses> oh she feelin harney tonight
[1:30:28] <medoodoo> horny honey = harney
[1:30:28] <%moonmintparadise> Harney
[1:30:29] <+Pendragwn> @AzureGale jotaro kujo you fool
[1:30:30] <%RealThiele> you swap CHA for WIS tho thank acolyte
[1:30:30] <$zyberion626> Strength domain is solid
[1:30:31] <AzureGale> Mom said it's my turn to kill chaos
[1:30:31] <+BigCoffee> DOn't pick GLory
[1:30:33] <enreimirai> It scales off of your level and wisdom.
[1:30:35] <Fnir> big strong
[1:30:35] <+JJJKopf> domains are super minor
[1:30:36] <The_Maddness> you give someone ELSE a bonus
[1:30:36] <%rekinom> The bonus is based on your level, NOT your charisma modifier @PatStaresAt
[1:30:36] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, this character creator is... A LOT.
[1:30:37] <+MisterAvry> Harney Puckett, Mayberry City Council
[1:30:37] <Treasure_Vault> Peach is us
[1:30:37] <+DerivedKnight> Destruction or Strength woul dbe good Domains for you!
[1:30:39] <%AgniBrandt> You can give SOMEONE ELSE that bonus
[1:30:39] <%strugglepunk2> No you actually don't need charisma for this one
[1:30:40] <BearGoo> anxiety time
[1:30:41] <DSD24> You are using Wisdom for this character Pat
[1:30:42] <quantras6> CHAOS MADE THE WRATH CHARACTER CREATOR, EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS I'M A BRAINLET
[1:30:42] <+nicoleymcquack> PATS TOO FAR GONE HES IN DND PURGATORY NOW
[1:30:43] <%TheDullaMAN> You buff OTHER PEOPLE's CHA
[1:30:44] <+TreskM> Under an hour for your character is fast
[1:30:45] <+pectusumbra> Paige this character creator is actually REALLY IN DEPTH
[1:30:46] <+kawachipto> This is the game TBH
[1:30:46] <%Gogogolem> Pick war
[1:30:46] <Archmortal> it does not scale on charisma, it scales on your level
[1:30:46] <+thetunnelhomer> You can cast it on anyone
[1:30:47] <ManfredA> your level is used for the bonus
[1:30:50] <+transporterthesequel> You have the Acolyte skill so you will use Wisdom instead of Charisma
[1:30:51] <%strugglepunk2> You give someone else a charisma bonus
[1:30:54] <Vyskus> It also says wisdom
[1:30:54] <+MisterAvry> charisma based checks
[1:30:56] <zerointelligence000> war might be good
[1:30:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt acolyte uses wisdom for CHA rolls
[1:30:57] <kingdinkyI> no it doesn't matter since you swap CHA for your WIS
[1:30:57] <Sharpevil> @PatStaresAt You give a friend extra charisma
[1:30:59] <%laserbeaming> It helps others with being Persuasive or Intimidating
[1:30:59] <@GeneralSCPatton> ADD YOUR LEVEL TO SOMEONE ELSE'S CHARISMA ROLL
[1:31:01] <medoodoo> JUST THE GAME PLAY..PLAY THE GAME PAT
[1:31:01] <%deviljhojho_> dont listen to the game its trying to decieve you
[1:31:02] <+BigCoffee> Enemies need charisma not you
[1:31:03] <enreimirai> So pat, you managed to pick one of the absolute most complicated classes in the entire system.
[1:31:04] <crazypieman7> @PatStaresAt The bonus is based on your level, the bonus is TO the charisma skill
[1:31:05] <i_chevalier> This seems to much.
[1:31:05] <$lotharrio> It gives a bonus to Charisma checks.
[1:31:07] <+MisterAvry> so if you're forced to talk you get a reroll
[1:31:07] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt its a buff to someone else
[1:31:08] <+maffewsus> You give SOMEONE ELSE the bonus
[1:31:09] <$mattynezz> No, it gives a bonus to Charisma
[1:31:10] <%AgniBrandt> Your level is added to a charisma check
[1:31:10] <%RealThiele> on CHA based checks not the stat
[1:31:10] <+DragonArt07> to someone else
[1:31:11] <kingdinkyI> Just go WAR
[1:31:12] <%darklordfodder> yes
[1:31:12] <Archmortal> it helps charisma checks, but the bonus is equal to your level
[1:31:12] <+pectusumbra> Help for friend
[1:31:12] <digaogrunge> Tell Paige I hope she finds a godd DM whos not a perv
[1:31:13] <+Toshatron> charisma-BASED you'd still use WIS
[1:31:13] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:31:13] <notsoy> you are buffing someone else's charisma with this, wisdom lets you use it more
[1:31:14] <%rekinom> Yes, it lets whoever you touched a bonus to charisma checks equal to your level @PatStaresAt
[1:31:15] <%darklordfodder> basicallg
[1:31:15] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you use wisdom for your persuasion so your persuasion rolls will still be good, and yes you can give the bonus to an ally
[1:31:19] <+tomdwarf> No, the bonus APPLIES to a Cha check. the bonus it gives isnt dependent on CHA.
[1:31:20] <medoodoo> this is taking too long
[1:31:20] <ManfredA> if your level is 5 and you use it your friend's CHA is now+5
[1:31:21] <medoodoo> lol
[1:31:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You picked Acolyte Pat. Replace ALL charisma rolls with wisdom.
[1:31:23] <heartlesshealer> Ignore Glory domain
[1:31:23] <Treasure_Vault> This makes just as much sense to me as it does to Pat
[1:31:27] <Reanimator83> I think Pat is broken... even more so LUL
[1:31:28] <%Gogogolem> look at war
[1:31:30] <i_chevalier> Its say slot to be stuck at the start of the game
[1:31:32] <shockmaster3> just pick a fighter and end your suffering
[1:31:32] <%RealThiele> STRONK
[1:31:32] <+MisterAvry> For Glory
[1:31:33] <chaosbringer28> youve replaced charisma based stuff with wisdom
[1:31:34] <+transporterthesequel> Yea, don’t worry about it
[1:31:41] <+transporterthesequel> STRONK
[1:31:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> 30ft aura of Heroin

[1:31:44] <+pectusumbra> it's general good buffs
[1:31:45] <%AgniBrandt> Heroism is a good spell
[1:31:46] <+Shonen_hero> heroism is a spell
[1:31:46] <+TheAdMerlin> Please, not Glory
[1:31:48] <+nicoleymcquack> I can honestly truly tell you now that i’d take twice as long in this screen, character creators are no laughing matter
[1:31:48] <%redthebaron> buff
[1:31:49] <%RealThiele> heroism is great
[1:31:49] <+thetunnelhomer> Wait, what does Heroism do?
[1:31:51] <%GalacticaPhanto> @medoodoo so? who gives a shit? let him go through it
[1:31:55] <enreimirai> heroism is a giant stat buff to everyone
[1:31:56] <+maffewsus> Heroism gives people big strong

[1:32:03] <+thetunnelhomer> Divine Favor and Bless
[1:32:04] <DSD24> Bless is a great buff
[1:32:05] <ManfredA> bane good
[1:32:06] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt heroism gives allies a massive health bonus, and increases all saving throws and attacks are more accurate. ITS REALLY GOOD
[1:32:06] <%Ghufufin> divine favor and cure

[1:32:19] <Orenjevel> +2 to stuff
[1:32:19] <+Shonen_hero> best things to pick here would be bless, bane, cure light wounds, true strike or divine favor
[1:32:20] <$lotharrio> Two spells... probably Bless and Bane.
[1:32:21] <%JoshManVGH> Heroisim was like +1 or +2 on hit.

[1:32:49] <friendlyrogue> B L E S S
[1:32:50] <enreimirai> Divine favour is fantastic btw.
[1:32:50] <+TheDeadpoolDash> Pathfinder is basically D&D 3.75
[1:32:50] <%Nekros4442> bane is the anti bless on enemies
[1:32:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> god is poggers confirmed
[1:32:54] <+MisterAvry> maybe Bane next level
[1:32:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bless and Bane are also opposed.
[1:32:56] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt expeditious retreat lets you run into combat SUPER FAST
[1:32:58] <+transporterthesequel> Bless always owns yes
[1:32:58] <+fetrigon> GivePLZ B L E S S TakeNRG
[1:32:58] <+InvertableQuasar> Bless is good, just a nice passive buff that's always worth it
[1:33:01] <+BigCoffee> Divine favour or bane
[1:33:03] <%JoshManVGH> This is SUPER MINMAXIMUS D&D 3.5 to the x'th degree!
[1:33:04] <+maffewsus> Bane is anti bless
[1:33:05] <%Monkeyweed21> bane is also good
[1:33:06] <Xodious987> @PatStaresAt smacking people with a greatsword? youll like Divine favor.
[1:33:06] <%half_awake1> half_awake1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[1:33:07] <%Piemono> Reverse Bless
[1:33:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bane is the anti-bless.
[1:33:09] <%laserbeaming> Bane is the opposite of Bless
[1:33:10] <enreimirai> oh, you can swap these whenever you want, btw.
[1:33:11] <+DeadPhoenix3> enemies get a save on bane
[1:33:12] <Calek> it's bless but bad for enemies
[1:33:12] <%vaporousTippler> Bless is for clerics. Divine favor lets you wreck.
[1:33:12] <+Shonen_hero> bane is like reverse bless
[1:33:13] <+InvertableQuasar> Bane is way worse because it allows a save
[1:33:13] <%Treuan> Why does he weat the mask?
[1:33:14] <%AgniBrandt> Bane is reverse bless
[1:33:14] <@SSaryn> Divine Favor, Bane, Bless and Expeditious Retreat, pick your poison.
[1:33:15] <%pokefan9956> YOURE A BIG GUY
[1:33:15] <$zyberion626> anti-bless
[1:33:16] <+MisterAvry> Giveth and Taketh
[1:33:17] <kingdinkyI> Divine favor to hit harder
[1:33:18] <%HollowedIdjit> Bane is Reverse Bless for enemies
[1:33:18] <crazypieman7> @PatStaresAt bane is anti-bless
[1:33:19] <+Immortalsblade> Bane is the anti-bless
[1:33:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> I thought Pat had something that gave him Bane already?
[1:33:21] <%linSP> bless deez nuts
[1:33:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can not go wrong with Bane and Bless.
[1:33:25] <joodatious> what its only a plus 1 to attack rolls? this bless sucks ass
[1:33:27] <quantras6> @patstaresat Bane is just Bless but it fucks the enemy up
[1:33:27] <+thetunnelhomer> Retreat is also good
[1:33:29] <+BigCoffee> Divine favour hits a lot
[1:33:31] <%RealThiele> lucky bonus sick
[1:33:32] <PriapusXII> bane is bless reverse card
[1:33:33] <+Shonen_hero> don't bother with that
[1:33:35] <CruxAustralis> magic weapon is very good
[1:33:37] <joodatious> give me my fucking d6 on all attacks you losers
[1:33:37] <+kewlmyc> I came back from getting food and we're still on "create a character"? Damn son
[1:33:38] <DSD24> I'd say healing
[1:33:38] <friendlyrogue> Divine Favor is pretty good
[1:33:41] <+kawachipto> magic weapon is useless
[1:33:45] <%laserbeaming> healing is useful
[1:33:46] <CruxAustralis> absolutely bother with that lmao
[1:33:47] <+BedHome> never bad to have more healing
[1:33:48] <%strugglepunk2> honestly, I'd go Divine and Cure
[1:33:48] <kingdinkyI> You will be drowing in potions
[1:33:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Do you really want to heal though?
[1:33:50] <%MugenSandan> True Strike Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:33:50] <+Shonen_hero> cure light wounds is good
[1:33:50] <+glgzephyr> always take healing spells if you are able!
[1:33:50] <joodatious> fuck this game they ruined bless trash
[1:33:50] <CruxAustralis> chat
[1:33:52] <amonimis> command Kappa
[1:33:52] <%castlerock42> It heals and hurts.
[1:33:53] <+AudacityESQ> You’re not still on the character sheet, I refuse tomatoSN
[1:33:53] <DSD24> You always need heals
[1:33:54] <%Nekros4442> you arent a healer tbh
[1:33:54] <+Shonen_hero> for a reason
[1:33:54] <%RealThiele> pro alignment isnt bad either
[1:33:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Healing is for nerds.
[1:33:55] <%HollowedIdjit> @joodatious you would be surprised how much people will kill for a +1 in Pathfinder
[1:33:55] <+Immortalsblade> You get healers
[1:33:56] <CruxAustralis> DEMONS HAVE DAMAGE RESISTANCE CHAT
[1:33:57] <$zyberion626> in this setting? magic weapon is pointless
[1:33:58] <kingdinkyI> divine favor is better
[1:33:58] <quantras6> Divine Favour and Bane tbh
[1:33:59] <CruxAustralis> YOU NEED MAGIC WEAPON
[1:33:59] <+BigCoffee> Magic Wepaon is useless here and you'll br drowning in potions
[1:34:04] <$lotharrio> Divine Favor scales
[1:34:04] <MrChaosDoughnut> Healing is good.
[1:34:05] <shockmaster3> does bless stack with divine favor?
[1:34:06] <+tomdwarf> Dont bother with healing stuff. Go for buffs. Clerics are better healers, and you can get potions.
[1:34:06] <%Nekros4442> its better to have buffs than heals
[1:34:07] <+transporterthesequel> @kewlmyc he’s actually doing REALLY WELL.
[1:34:07] <%Gogogolem> you get more of these spells later
[1:34:08] <%laserbeaming> Divine Favor is worth getting
[1:34:09] <heartlesshealer> What is the scream?
[1:34:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> who needs healing when you can just un-heal the bad peepo
[1:34:11] <+pectusumbra> what ones are on the bottom? Your window is blocking some
[1:34:12] <@SSaryn> Divine Favor is something you cannot go wrong with.
[1:34:12] <%Puhff> Yeh yeh Divine Favor
[1:34:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> Cure or Divine Favor.
[1:34:14] <CruxAustralis> You extremely need magic weapon you crazy people
[1:34:16] <+thetunnelhomer> Retreat is also good for movement
[1:34:18] <%bevyrage> divine favor's luck bonus stacks with every other bonus
[1:34:18] <%JoshManVGH> I thoughy Clerics got to freely change their spells from their entire spell list when they rest.
[1:34:19] <DSD24> I'd say Bless and Heals
[1:34:21] <+DeadPhoenix3> divine favor only affects you and stacks with bless, but it gets stronger at higher levels
[1:34:23] <+Shonen_hero> like I'mma be honest, I've seen a lot of builds suggest bless and cure light wounds as your first spell options
[1:34:23] <$zyberion626> @CruxAustralis the game showers you with masterwork and cold iron weapons
[1:34:23] <+DerivedKnight> Divine Favor's a good Damage Boosting spell.
[1:34:24] <IvanMistwalker> Divine Favor
[1:34:24] <digaogrunge> Bless or Divine
[1:34:28] <%RealThiele> if they flood you with potions then divine favor and command
[1:34:30] <%HollowedIdjit> Never Go True Strike
[1:34:31] <%laserbeaming> Shield of Faith is also good.
[1:34:32] <Calek> is true strike trash in this game too
[1:34:33] <kingdinkyI> you're a self buffing class
[1:34:33] <%strugglepunk2> Divine is better than bless imo
[1:34:35] <+BigCoffee> You get more splels later
[1:34:35] <joodatious> @HollowedIdjit a d6 is better then a plust one any day
[1:34:38] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt remove fear protects everyone from fear. which is a pain to deal with qwithout it
[1:34:38] <%JoshManVGH> And levle 0 spell?
[1:34:42] <Orenjevel> Command is important if you want to make use of your High Wisdom's DC bonus
[1:34:43] <+InvertableQuasar> Bless and Cure Light is good
[1:34:43] <joodatious> the minimum is a plus one
[1:34:43] <+BigCoffee> Never too much
[1:34:44] <%Gogogolem> double down on buffs
[1:34:45] <%Nekros4442> no this is fine
[1:34:46] <quantras6> @patstaresat get bane and bless then
[1:34:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> no no no, double down on buffs!
[1:34:47] <+thetunnelhomer> That's fine
[1:34:47] <heartlesshealer> shield is okay
[1:34:48] <@Spydurman> Shield of Faith is solid
[1:34:48] <%laserbeaming> NEVER enough buffs in this game
[1:34:48] <%redthebaron> you get to add spells later
[1:34:49] <+Shonen_hero> you can get divine favor later
[1:34:49] <+InvertableQuasar> Also good!
[1:34:49] <%Nekros4442> get both the buffs
[1:34:50] <+transporterthesequel> @patstaresat you are doing good and you are big and strong, you have almost reached the midgame.
[1:34:50] <DSD24> Ok go for it
[1:34:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Can you take like Metor Storm or something
[1:34:51] <+maffewsus> You are big damage man, get buffs to deal MORE damage
[1:34:52] <+kawachipto> u need all the buffs
[1:34:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Protection from Alignment is somewhat busted since 90% of what you'll fight is evil.
[1:34:52] <+DerivedKnight> NO! Go with the Bless before anything
[1:34:52] <ManfredA> you're the buff class dude
[1:34:53] <%strugglepunk2> that's good
[1:34:53] <@SSaryn> You're an Inquisitor. Also you have Bless.
[1:34:54] <+DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt you can redo class and stats later in the game, so don't sweat it too hard.
[1:34:54] <$zyberion626> that's fine
[1:34:54] <+tomdwarf> If they buff different stuff, its not too much.
[1:34:55] <Orenjevel> Buff Stacking is Victory
[1:34:55] <CruxAustralis> @zyberion626 only early demons are weak to those, for anything above a Wretch you need Magic
[1:34:57] <friendlyrogue> Valid
[1:34:59] <PriapusXII> go smack not heal bitch, you can ally with a healer
[1:34:59] <Archmortal> but Bless though
[1:35:00] <reasonance> let the clerics do the part buffing
[1:35:00] <+DeadPhoenix3> do not get bane
[1:35:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> ypu can make yourself or ally into a monster
[1:35:02] <digaogrunge> GOOD
[1:35:03] <CruxAustralis> Magic or Good
[1:35:04] <%RealThiele> good enough
[1:35:07] <%Gogogolem> Yes
[1:35:08] <%strugglepunk2> Divine and cure is better
[1:35:08] <+BigCoffee> DO it
[1:35:09] <Sharpevil> YES
[1:35:12] <%baka_sugoi> LUL LUL LUL
[1:35:12] <enreimirai> For anyone saying magic bonus is pointless: it lets you ignore damage reduction. The higher the bonus, the more damage reduction you ignore. +5 ignores non-typed damage reduction.
[1:35:13] <%MugenSandan> YOU ARE A SHITHEAD
[1:35:14] <%redthebaron> this is fine
[1:35:14] <chaosbringer28> yep
[1:35:15] <Archmortal> FUCK THOSE GOBLINS
[1:35:15] <%lumporr> tilt the table
[1:35:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bane and Bless are the basic bitch choices FOR GOOD REASON.
[1:35:17] <DSD24> Yeah you buff the party and fuck up the enemies
[1:35:17] <$lotharrio> I go up, you go down. I win.
[1:35:17] <joodatious> they ruined bless pat
[1:35:17] <+thetunnelhomer> Plus this game has unlimited free respecs so you can change whenever
[1:35:17] <signofzeta> make allies better, make enemies worse
[1:35:18] <chaosbringer28> YES
[1:35:18] <%Gogogolem> be an assholes
[1:35:18] <%Monkeyweed21> thats correct
[1:35:19] <%decent_gaming> Absolutely
[1:35:19] <%JoshManVGH> make a gap, and widen it.
[1:35:20] <%Piemono> Yeah its great, Fuck them Demons
[1:35:20] <heartlesshealer> You are melee, so it's a way to deal LUL
[1:35:20] <quantras6> Pretty much
[1:35:21] <%RealThiele> for a caster focused character maybe
[1:35:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> IMPORTANT NOTE: Bonuses of the same type do not stack. Diversify the bonus types.
[1:35:21] <+DerivedKnight> WHO'S FEELINGS WE LOOKING TO HURT? THE AI!? FUCK EM
[1:35:21] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt trust me you need Magic Weapon
[1:35:21] <%Puhff> SO ON BRAND THEN
[1:35:23] <+transporterthesequel> Yup
[1:35:23] <shockmaster3> welcom to bard school
[1:35:26] <Sharpevil> I can't wait to fuck some goblins
[1:35:27] <L3m0nTwi5t> Pretty much
[1:35:27] <DSD24> Almost done!
[1:35:28] <%newtype89> bless better it effects your whole party
[1:35:29] <+pectusumbra> I mean that sounds right for inquisitor Pat
[1:35:29] <%lumporr> ultimate hypeman
[1:35:30] <CruxAustralis> you are going to regret not getting magic weapon
[1:35:31] <Madinki> But you ARE a shithead
[1:35:31] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> If you're a caster, you're supposed to be a shithead
[1:35:32] <friendlyrogue> Ultimate hype man
[1:35:32] <%sandrews> Bane and Bless more like BREAD AND BUTTER
[1:35:33] <+kawachipto> LUL true
[1:35:34] <Fnir> Perfect
[1:35:36] <%ahomeschooldropout> YES
[1:35:36] <%DoubleRrico> screamlord class
[1:35:37] <%hrbeck_> yeah
[1:35:38] <DSD24> YES
[1:35:38] <%Gogogolem> Yes
[1:35:38] <notsoy> ABSOLUTELY it does
[1:35:38] <joodatious> no
[1:35:38] <kingdinkyI> yes
[1:35:39] <lambishly> YES
[1:35:39] <CruxAustralis> yes
[1:35:39] <+BigCoffee> it does
[1:35:39] <+Shonen_hero> kind of
[1:35:39] <%strugglepunk2> Yep!
[1:35:40] <+thetunnelhomer> Sorta
[1:35:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> IT SUPER DOES.
[1:35:40] <%Meekest> Big matters
[1:35:40] <%Nekros4442> it does matter
[1:35:40] <+Immortalsblade> Chaotic Good
[1:35:41] <ManfredA> yes
[1:35:41] <$zyberion626> yes
[1:35:41] <reasonance> of course it matters
[1:35:42] <amonimis> CN!
[1:35:42] <count_bob> yes
[1:35:42] <%Questiy> Yes
[1:35:43] <DSD24> It super does Pat
[1:35:43] <+Immortalsblade> YES
[1:35:44] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt speech options
[1:35:44] <L3m0nTwi5t> Yes
[1:35:44] <%castlerock42> Yes.
[1:35:45] <kingdinkyI> it really matters
[1:35:45] <%Gogogolem> holyshit does it matter
[1:35:46] <%laserbeaming> At the start, not really
[1:35:46] <%NateyBeak> ah yes, the "retail Supervisor" class
[1:35:47] <%JoshManVGH> In some conversations and with your god, yes.
[1:35:47] <+JJJKopf> sort of
[1:35:48] <%HollowedIdjit> ALIGNMENT MATTERS IN PATHFINDER
[1:35:48] <friendlyrogue> Yes
[1:35:49] <The_Maddness> lignmenet Matters ALOT
[1:35:49] <+fetrigon> yes
[1:35:49] <+BigCoffee> go chaotic good
[1:35:49] <+DerivedKnight> It does! Your alignment affects the people who interact with youa nd your choices.
[1:35:50] <CruxAustralis> if you change alignment you lose your spells @PatStaresAt
[1:35:50] <%cade_calrayn> Have we actually even played the game yet?
[1:35:51] <%bread_assassin> Y E S
[1:35:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> True neutral
[1:35:51] <lambishly> EVIL
[1:35:51] <+maffewsus> Alignment big matters
[1:35:51] <%redthebaron> just pick the one you like
[1:35:51] <%IamGrapes> it defininatly matters
[1:35:52] <%AgniBrandt> It affects your options down the line
[1:35:52] <chaosbringer28> absolutly matters
[1:35:53] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah this matters a LOT
[1:35:53] <+LazyBumNetwork> Talk shit get hit
[1:35:54] <Archmortal> Everything Is Connected
[1:35:54] <enreimirai> Yes, you need to be roughly based on your god and you need it for your mythic path
[1:35:55] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt it does eventually but dont worry about it too much for now. tbh CG is prob the best option for you
[1:35:55] <+Shonen_hero> I wouldn't go CE
[1:35:55] <%SpoonheadInExile> CN
[1:35:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt This will affect so many things.
[1:35:55] <%RealThiele> somewhat
[1:35:56] <%Nekros4442> This super fucking matters
[1:35:57] <+DeadPhoenix3> for you it does because your god will not like it if you get away from those options
[1:35:57] <$lotharrio> Matters for conversations and such, at least.
[1:35:58] <%ahomeschooldropout> Your Allignment opens up new dialog, skills, and party members
[1:35:58] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  if you piss off your god enough he'll take away your powers.
[1:35:58] <+Immortalsblade> It is literally the most important thing in the game
[1:35:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> enlightened centrist
[1:35:59] <heartlesshealer> Deity limited your choices and it matters for Alignment Damage
[1:35:59] <%Order_of_Mystery> it very much matters, effects dialogue options
[1:35:59] <count_bob> chaotic good
[1:35:59] <%Piemono> Just go CN
[1:36:01] <digaogrunge> oc it matters
[1:36:03] <%cade_calrayn> I’m legit confused
[1:36:03] <kingdinkyI> neutral and see how things pan out
[1:36:04] <%RealThiele> CG is fine
[1:36:04] <+DragonArt07> it matters for the good shit later
[1:36:04] <TioXyco> it's DnD, even your underwear color matters
[1:36:04] <%laserbeaming> NOT FOR INQUISITORS
[1:36:05] <Sharpevil> It would be pretty weird to play Wrath of the Righteous as Chaotic Evil
[1:36:07] <i_chevalier> chaotic neutral obviously
[1:36:07] <+transporterthesequel> CHAT DO NOT TELL HIM ABOUT MYHIC PATHS.
[1:36:08] <lambishly> CE
[1:36:08] <%baka_sugoi> oh boy
[1:36:08] <%IamGrapes> this aint no baby 5e nonsense where alignment is a ribbon
[1:36:08] <+Rofiarf> CN
[1:36:08] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can be any of those 4 alignments
[1:36:09] <+Immortalsblade> Pick Chaotic Good
[1:36:10] <+BigCoffee> CN or CG is best
[1:36:10] <%Nekros4442> Chaotic Neutral
[1:36:10] <+Shonen_hero> CE is just 'kill all' kind of evil
[1:36:10] <shockmaster3> some choices can only be picked for certain alignment
[1:36:11] <%JoshManVGH> What allignment is your god?
[1:36:12] <ManfredA> you have to stay within one step of your god
[1:36:12] <$zyberion626> CG or CN
[1:36:12] <enreimirai> CN or CG
[1:36:12] <%RealThiele> CG is like han solo
[1:36:13] <+InvertableQuasar> Oh jesus, that's a problem
[1:36:13] <Tracazoid> Chaotic Evil, be the Lex Luthor you always dreamed of being
[1:36:14] <+pectusumbra> CG for loose cannon inquisitor that doesn't play by the rules?
[1:36:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Chaotic Good, or you'll be dealing with some bullshit down the line
[1:36:16] <+tomdwarf> Only if you go off the 4 they're offering you.
[1:36:18] <+DeadPhoenix3> you have to work to change alignment though
[1:36:19] <+BedHome> IF YOU STOP BEING CHAOTIC YOU LOSE YOUR SPELLS  can be any chaotic
[1:36:20] <IvanMistwalker> CG
[1:36:20] <quantras6> @patstaresat there's scrolls of atonement you can use to reset your alignment
[1:36:20] <%laserbeaming> Inquisitors never lose spells for alignment
[1:36:20] <friendlyrogue> You have to stay CN adjacent to keep your spells
[1:36:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> radical neutral
[1:36:21] <+Shonen_hero> CG
[1:36:21] <$lotharrio> Chaotic Neutral looks like it will let you fuck around a good bit. It's a slow progress to a new alignment.
[1:36:22] <+DerivedKnight> CN if you want to go middle of the Road, CG if you wanna be decent boy
[1:36:22] <+InvertableQuasar> Just don't pick lawful options much
[1:36:22] <amonimis> so CN ofc
[1:36:22] <+DeadPhoenix3> it wont just happen
[1:36:22] <chaosbringer28> inquisitors get some leniency on this
[1:36:23] <%HollowedIdjit> @patstaresat there are also specific abilities and spells that affect targets based on their alignment
[1:36:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mythic Paths will explode Pat's head right now.
[1:36:23] <%castlerock42> Chaotic good or Chaotic neutral are both good.
[1:36:25] <+Shonen_hero> woo
[1:36:25] <%linSP> COCONUT GUN
[1:36:26] <CruxAustralis> CG is good
[1:36:26] <DSD24> Chaotic good is rad
[1:36:27] <%baka_sugoi> i can see it
[1:36:28] <%moonmintparadise> just pick chaotic good
[1:36:28] <@SSaryn> Pathfinder. Go Neutral or Chaotic Good and work from there.
[1:36:28] <Badgerconda_> chaotic good is objectively the best alignment
[1:36:31] <lambishly> Chaotic Good is for smooth brain cowards
[1:36:32] <+BigCoffee> You'll mainly fight Chaotic Evil monsters in the demon killing story
[1:36:32] <+Immortalsblade> Be robin hood
[1:36:34] <heartlesshealer> That's Clerics I thought???
[1:36:35] <$zyberion626> mhmm
[1:36:35] <+Tainted_Ninja> yeyeyeye
[1:36:35] <+tomdwarf> Just means, always be against "the man", man. Dont be lawful, then youll lose spells.
[1:36:35] <%hrbeck_> alignment is one of the dumbest fucking things from old dnd and preserved here
[1:36:38] <dizimous> ONLY IF YOU EXIT YOUR DEITY'S ALIGNMENTS
[1:36:39] <@GeneralSCPatton> CG for life
[1:36:40] <%bread_assassin> Chaotic Good is the most interesting of the Goods.
[1:36:41] <%king_wragles> there's no bad alignment, except LN
[1:36:42] <notsoy> WOW this dude ugly as hell
[1:36:42] <CruxAustralis> you need Magic Weapon trust me @PatStaresAt

[1:37:45] <quantras6> @patstaresat there's a scroll to reset alignment to what it was at level 1, so if you end up straying from your dietys alignment you can pop one of them.
[1:37:46] <CruxAustralis> GO FAT

[1:45:02] <@Ranryu692> Seelah Kelai
[1:45:03] <%moonmintparadise> You are basically Dwarf Doomguy ?
[1:45:04] <DSD24> Terendlev doesn't get a portrait
[1:45:04] <%RealThiele> ACAB
[1:45:06] <%cooldude69xx> Seelah is one of Pathfinders big famous adventurers
[1:45:07] <CruxAustralis> dragon Pog
[1:45:08] <+Pendragwn> An angrier pat would have had the right amount of Wrath for this game
[1:45:11] <+Shonen_hero> yeah
[1:45:12] <Archmortal> "what are you doing here?"  I WAS DRAGGED HERE YOU JACKASS
[1:45:14] <+kawachipto> Seelah owns as a companion, but is pretty bland
[1:45:14] <slix3431> She is a puny dragon
[1:45:19] <%laserbeaming> Dragons can take human form
[1:45:21] <+Shonen_hero> dragons can shapeshift in D&D and Pathfinder
[1:45:21] <+Pendragwn> dragon deez nuts
[1:45:23] <enreimirai> shes a silver dargin

[1:45:26] <Nordguy> Get that drussy Pat
[1:45:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You can be a dragon too, if you're cool enough.

[1:45:32] <+Shonen_hero> fuck you Hirun

[1:45:41] <%Wallabri> "Exposition!"
[1:45:42] <count_bob> she's a dragon
[1:45:46] <enreimirai> silver dragons actually spend more time in human than dargin form

[1:46:09] <%HolePunchLeaf> AMOGUS
[1:46:11] <@Ranryu692> you're blocking the character portrait
[1:46:17] <%Reveresao> Can we marry dragon?
[1:46:21] <+fetrigon> D R U S S Y
[1:46:24] <$zyberion626> Seelah is chill, a very rare trait for a paladin
[1:46:26] <%blue8moon> why doesn't she have a portrait?
[1:46:26] <joodatious> pat is the portrait
[1:46:26] <quantras6> Yeah Seelah is a iconic for the Paladin class, just like Amiri is the iconic Barbarian.
[1:46:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Pat IS THE character
[1:46:28] <%baka_sugoi> Dragon WAIFU PogChamp
[1:46:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's just Pat's character portrait though.
[1:46:30] <%IamGrapes> im already liking this one better then the first one
[1:46:30] <$lotharrio> Pat is the Character portrait

[1:46:53] <count_bob> @lazybumnetwork It's D&D man. subtlety isn't it's strongest suit.
[1:46:54] <@Ranryu692> Oh, that wasn't Terendelev's face under you?
[1:46:55] <%alphonseisbest> UL
[1:46:56] <%Wallabri> he IS the character portrait
[1:46:56] <huskarl_zap> Wait, Tiamet or Bahamut?
[1:46:58] <%alphonseisbest> LUL
[1:47:04] <@Ranryu692> thank you either way lol
[1:47:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> This wound was inflicted by a Morgul Blade.
[1:47:07] <joodatious> @GarbageNirvana why tho

[1:47:15] <+WeLucklessJacks> Pat IS the character portrait.

[1:47:36] <%cooldude69xx> @GarbageNirvana Probably gonna die soon
[1:47:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> honestly you really should put your facecam over the portrait lol
[1:47:37] <%alphonseisbest> @GarbageNirvana budget
[1:47:37] <$lotharrio> Babahamut
[1:47:38] <%Reveresao> the chad stick
[1:47:40] <%redthebaron> big demon weapon stabbed
[1:47:41] <+Aullama> Stabbed with the hot sauce
[1:47:42] <%laserbeaming> the spiciest stick
[1:47:43] <shockmaster3> don't think about it
[1:47:44] <medoodoo> there's something interesting about in-game pat interacting with npcs - it's like a child asking an adult questions about the world
[1:47:46] <+Shonen_hero> it's your stigmata wound
[1:47:47] <MemAlephh> the writing in this game is fun but dont expect poe or tyranny level writing
[1:47:48] <%blue8moon> time to get drunk
[1:47:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah this festival will surely not end in a horrible tragedy.
[1:47:52] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Go get drunk!
[1:47:53] <zerointelligence000> nothing bad happens in festivals
[1:47:54] <AxelCezar> this game starts a lot of heated discussions iin forums
[1:47:54] <Orenjevel> Cool you have a chest infection good job
[1:48:06] <shockmaster3> read faster
[1:48:08] <DSD24> Look how good that portrait looks at the bottom
[1:48:08] <+MisterAvry> hee hee
[1:48:14] <quantras6> Theres a bunch of named characters in this area who are all companions
[1:48:15] <owazowski> He got stabbed by the protagonist knife
[1:48:16] <BliVru> "you are suffering from a severe case of Plot"
[1:48:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> That was just a tutorial saying quests are thing and you have a quest log.
[1:48:22] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Are you on real time or turn based combat rn?
[1:48:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> You know video games.
[1:48:31] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt ACTIVATE TURN BASED MODE
[1:48:33] <MechaBaphomet> is this game like divinity 2?
[1:48:33] <%redthebaron> real time
[1:48:34] <%Afterman_> the chess buitton
[1:48:35] <shockmaster3> probably real time
[1:48:38] <DSD24> THere's no combat yet
[1:48:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> It defaults to real-time first.
[1:48:39] <%logoth_> What is happening in this video game
[1:48:39] <%Afterman_> bot left turns it to turn based
[1:48:40] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Fight someone and find out
[1:48:41] <%Questiy> How can you play reading game if you not good at reading 4head
[1:48:41] <+Shonen_hero> Rtwp right now
[1:48:41] <%laserbeaming> REal time by default
[1:48:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> default is probably real time
[1:48:42] <Orenjevel> lmao
[1:48:43] <+JJJKopf> hit T to change it
[1:48:44] <ScarletPrime> Its real time right now. You change it with the rook button.
[1:48:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> There will be a tutorial.
[1:48:50] <+Shonen_hero> now your turnt
[1:48:50] <Orenjevel> it keeps happening
[1:48:51] <%sandrews> you sound like dr claw or noob saibot
[1:48:52] <shockmaster3> play real time coward
[1:48:52] <CruxAustralis> turn based is very good
[1:48:53] <+Shonen_hero> time to get lit
[1:48:53] <huskarl_zap> based on what?
[1:48:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Pat only hopes to look as good looking as his Dwarf portrait ingame. :P
[1:48:55] <%Sotetsu> Turn based is so fun
[1:48:56] <%baka_sugoi> S A V E
[1:49:01] <montauk_mystery> fukin with the chest bone
[1:49:03] <leinadtonu> sample the dart, throw the manequin,  etc
[1:49:05] <joodatious> okay you can move the cam this game isn't worthless
[1:49:06] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Even though your body is leaking like a sieve go get hammered
[1:49:06] <%redthebaron> m for map
[1:49:06] <owazowski> More like turn CRINGE
[1:49:09] <nomnombear64> did you find the path?
[1:49:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> now you have to wait for every npc to take their turn before you can do anything
[1:49:10] <quantras6> The game is made around real time but pressing T will instantly switch you between them.
[1:49:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> You should go talk to these Peasants.
[1:49:12] <Orenjevel> T toggles it
[1:49:12] <+JustToWatch> m for map
[1:49:14] <shockmaster3> I think the game was made with turn based first
[1:49:16] <%IamGrapes> i remember the turn based in the first game being a little Jank. i hope its better in this one
[1:49:34] <+isadorenta> this area tanks my fps so bad
[1:49:34] <%vaporousTippler> Surprise. Turn based is more jank in this one. Somehow.
[1:49:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> you just spent an hour picking them all
[1:49:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> It is better but still not as good as Divinity.
[1:49:41] <%linSP> of course
[1:49:42] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you can move ALL of those
[1:49:44] <dybia> Took your weapons away, but with a hat like that the back of your hand will do
[1:49:50] <MemAlephh> turn based is kinda buggy
[1:49:53] <joodatious> i will only pick up this game if the turn based mode isn't awful like the first game
[1:49:55] <+Shonen_hero> the hot bars are sloppy, you can futz with them
[1:49:58] <MemAlephh> but this game is too hard not to have it on
[1:49:59] <$yeknomlive> turn based in this is like I'm div 2 or baldurs gate 3
[1:50:03] <+JJJKopf> dismiss it for grease and stuff
[1:50:03] <slix3431> T O U C H
[1:50:04] <quantras6> @shockmaster3 nah, Kingmaker was real time first, someone made a mod to give it turn based combat and it was popular enough Owlcat made a official turn based mode.
[1:50:10] <%laserbeaming> You can only have one judgement active at the time
[1:50:11] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt click on the S and the A for spells and abilities respectfully
[1:50:13] <shockmaster3> yes
[1:50:14] <%redthebaron> yrah
[1:50:17] <CruxAustralis> yep
[1:50:19] <+Shonen_hero> if he runs into a bug on turn base he can just turn it off
[1:50:19] <signofzeta> ya weapon sets
[1:50:19] <maybefalco> that looks like weapon slots
[1:50:21] <%Ghufufin> weapon sluts
[1:50:21] <leinadtonu> yup
[1:50:21] <+Shonen_hero> No big deal
[1:50:21] <+Adomisk> Is he playing Inquisator?
[1:50:23] <$mattynezz> yes
[1:50:24] <+Immortalsblade> yep
[1:50:24] <%SinnerEbru> is this an MMO or just an prg
[1:50:25] <chaosbringer28> yep
[1:50:27] <%SinnerEbru> rpg*
[1:50:33] <+MisterAvry> oh nooo

[1:50:38] <$yeknomlive> single player rpg
[1:50:39] <%TheFabledAble> those are your cantrips
[1:50:39] <quantras6> @adomisk yeah of Gorum
[1:50:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> S for spellbooks AKA NERD SHIT and A for abilities.

[1:50:44] <enreimirai> if ya want press B
[1:50:45] <horse_disguised_as_horse> dewit
[1:50:46] <+BedHome> YES
[1:50:48] <%TheFabledAble> the 1 on the side is the spells you have prepared
[1:50:49] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt press I
[1:50:52] <%laserbeaming> You can deactivate your armor visually in the Inventory Screen, if you want your cool armor from the character creator
[1:50:53] <shockmaster3> has pat never played a CRPG?
[1:50:56] <%MugenSandan> Hold Pat, EXPAND YOUR MIND
[1:50:58] <slix3431> Why can't Pat hold his Cantrips
[1:51:00] <tanarath> AS MANY ABILITIES AS YOU'D LIKE, Pat
[1:51:01] <$lotharrio> Daze is good.
[1:51:03] <$mattynezz> Cantrips suck balls, don't work about them
[1:51:03] <MemAlephh> @shockmaster3 no LUL
[1:51:06] <+Adomisk> Did he play Kingmaker before?
[1:51:10] <dybia> Right click a cantrip to make it your autoattack
[1:51:10] <%linSP> kill!
[1:51:20] <Orenjevel> You thought you were free!
[1:51:22] <leinadtonu> disturb the undead
[1:51:24] <reasonance> he did pillars on stream, didn't he?
[1:51:24] <+kawachipto> why didn't pat pick big dumb fighter man if options scare him LUL
[1:51:24] <shockmaster3> @MemAlephh why scared then?
[1:51:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Keep in mind the only useful cantrips are light and dismiss spell.
[1:51:35] <%linSP> coop de grace
[1:51:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> coop dee grayse
[1:51:42] <MemAlephh> im gonna be honest theres so many spells and abilities in this game i didnt even bother setting up hotbars
[1:51:47] <tanarath> Oh man, Pat's getting into it!
[1:51:47] <+Shonen_hero> coup de grace is for when opponents are knocked down. You can get a super kill on them
[1:51:48] <%alphonseisbest> @shockmaster3 he says he beaT bALDURS GATE 1 AND 2, ALSO HE LPED POE1 FULLY
[1:51:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> there's just some rando dwarf in the middle of the town square yelling "YEAH FUCK THE UNDEAD" seemingly to himself
[1:51:53] <SaltyAzteca> talk about they mama
[1:51:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Demoralize is where you say questionable things about the target's mother.
[1:51:59] <Orenjevel> Guidance is the only really useful spell here
[1:52:00] <DSD24> Inspire Rage is for those Support Barbarians
[1:52:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> And they have to roll a will save or else cry about it.
[1:52:09] <DSD24> Like Pack Rager!
[1:52:10] <%athuramn> @shockmaster3 he's not new, the other guys trolling for no reason
[1:52:12] <%cooldude69xx> @kawachipto Most of these options are just base game rules for every class. In teh table to panyway

[1:52:26] <tanarath> golf clap
[1:52:31] <+Speed1ines> Can we get a new bit? Pat acting dumb on purpose is lasting too long.

[1:53:29] <$lotharrio> It's cause you sinned from drinking.
[1:53:30] <Treasure_Vault> I can't believe you are receiving a standard RPG backstory

[1:54:52] <+WeLucklessJacks> Damn, what a jobber.
[1:54:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> So anyone asking "Why does this dragon have no portrait?" that's why.
[1:54:56] <+RoByte2> The dragon gets one-shot and he thinks he's got a spell to protect against THAT?
[1:54:59] <leinadtonu> FUBAR
[1:54:59] <+skm742> Yeah, is this guard like 1 foot tall?
[1:55:00] <CruxAustralis> EVERYTHING'S ON FIRE OH GOD
[1:55:02] <$lotharrio> Demon lords are a demogorgons.

[1:55:12] <DSD24> The guard is a Gnome

[1:55:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Welp.
[1:56:00] <quantras6> @alphonseisbest not all of them, one of the mythic paths for the player is becoming a golden dragon
[1:56:01] <ape_hawk> you did more damage than a dragon
[1:56:05] <$yeknomlive> better roll a million nat 20's
[1:56:05] <Calek> this is the raddest
[1:56:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> dead
[1:56:06] <+maffewsus> ah
[1:56:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> game over
[1:56:08] <+DerivedKnight> Not all Dragons, but this Dragon wasn't one of the most Ancient Dragons by her looks. So she got ran the fuck on.
[1:56:08] <+RelikaNox> Roll credits
[1:56:08] <%linSP> oh noooo
[1:56:08] <%redthebaron> the light on the cutscene is really funny

[1:56:11] <%LeiaSkynoober> GAME OVER
[1:56:11] <sendart> did we get dragons dogmaed
[1:56:12] <dizimous> @alphonseisbest Pretty much, Demon lords are not that far away from being Deities
[1:56:12] <+Immortalsblade> Keep in mind you just hurt a demigod
[1:56:15] <SaltyAzteca> MORAL VICTORY
[1:56:15] <+isadorenta> bye
[1:56:15] <%TheWinged7> MORTIS
[1:56:15] <+Shonen_hero> you didn't win
[1:56:15] <$SGrim> You took a tumble
[1:56:16] <k_af> good effort
[1:56:17] <$zyberion626> good game guys
[1:56:17] <+JJJKopf> and now you're dead
[1:56:17] <Sol_Install> i can't believe you did more than the dragon
[1:56:17] <%TheDullaMAN> S'a good hit
[1:56:17] <joodatious> pfffftt
[1:56:17] <%cooldude69xx> Got some good hits in tho
[1:56:17] <dreadedcthulhu> he did yell about getting hit like that
[1:56:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> solid trade
[1:56:18] <@goose_attack_almanac> thats more than the dragon
[1:56:18] <slix3431> Pat is stronger than silver dragon
[1:56:18] <DSD24> You got a hit in thats more for that Dragon Lady
[1:56:18] <+maffewsus> you did better than the dragon
[1:56:19] <%TheFabledAble> more than the dragon can say
[1:56:19] <CruxAustralis> you actually can turn into a dragon it's so cool
[1:56:20] <Treasure_Vault> Bad matchup
[1:56:20] <%Cerabret100> did more than the dragon
[1:56:20] <joodatious> literally jobbed
[1:56:21] <%Ghufufin> you hit him which is impressive
[1:56:21] <+MisterAvry> you totally hit it
[1:56:21] <enreimirai> The funny part is its a normal crossbow, and that things damage reduction is high enough that a crossbow literally cant hurt it unless you crit and rolled max damage
[1:56:22] <%MidnightBurst12> this festival sucks
[1:56:22] <%IamGrapes> you got a shot in, i call that a win
[1:56:22] <slix3431> Like a wimp
[1:56:25] <%SinnerEbru> holy shit u can switch between real time and turn based??????? epic
[1:56:26] <%TheWinged7> it wasnt a P
[1:56:27] <reasonance> got some good hits in tho
[1:56:27] <tanarath> Still better than the dragon
[1:56:27] <$mattynezz> It was a good hit though
[1:56:28] <%linSP> bruh she didnt even do anything
[1:56:29] <%lucky_icarus> Wouldn't call it a battle....
[1:56:29] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt if you just crit it would all be over
[1:56:30] <%MightyDuckShoes> She fell hard
[1:56:30] <%chiazam> jobbed
[1:56:31] <%Kyma1020> fought?
[1:56:32] <chaosbringer28> you are lvl 1, you hit something that a min was lvl 20 more or less
[1:56:33] <%sandrews> well now that was an intresting epilogue
[1:56:36] <CruxAustralis> @alphonseisbest depends on the age of the dragon but yes, Demon Lords are just slightly below full gods
[1:56:37] <+maffewsus> got some good licks
[1:56:39] <%Reveresao> what wasn't a fight.........
[1:56:39] <owazowski> Twas hardly a battle
[1:56:44] <@GeneralSCPatton> You definitely did 1 non-lethal damage that immediately regenerated.
[1:56:45] <%deviljhojho_> what a jobber
[1:56:45] <+nicoleymcquack> she quite simply did nothing
[1:56:45] <CruxAustralis> there is one Demon Lord who is a god
[1:56:45] <Orenjevel> game over
[1:56:49] <%linSP> she just transformed and then died
[1:56:50] <AzureGale> H I C
[1:56:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Get back up there and kick his ass!
[1:56:54] <CruxAustralis> You can have her as a deity
[1:56:54] <heartlesshealer> oh boy the under dark
[1:56:56] <%HotSauceFiend> Hello just popped in. this looks like  a .... PoE?
[1:56:57] <%NopeBadguy> You got some good hits in tho, right
[1:56:58] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt spellbook will be to your interest
[1:57:04] <Orenjevel> that is one *wide* book
[1:57:05] <huskarl_zap> >crossbow = simple wat
[1:57:05] <+LazyBumNetwork> I didn’t hear no bell
[1:57:06] <heartlesshealer> have fun
[1:57:08] <shockmaster3> thats for later
[1:57:09] <%laserbeaming> in the little gear icon you can deactivate the armor and use your class gear visually
[1:57:09] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
[1:57:09] <joodatious> worlds weakest silver dragon
[1:57:11] <tanarath> awww ye, crossbow!
[1:57:11] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt pres B
[1:57:11] <+Shonen_hero> don't get access to that until later
[1:57:12] <quantras6> interesting detail, when you wake up in here you have a few seconds left of a feather fall spell
[1:57:12] <%Piemono> Don't worry about Mythic for now
[1:57:12] <%GarbageNirvana> They shoulda let her get SOMETHING in
[1:57:13] <%TheFabledAble> IGNORE
[1:57:13] <%redthebaron> don't worry about it
[1:57:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> @HotSauceFiend It's the same genre but closer to Dungeons and Dragons.
[1:57:17] <masheshardest> dw about that
[1:57:17] <%sandrews> it's greyed out my dude
[1:57:20] <penitentpendant> She jobbed so hard it feels like a setup
[1:57:20] <+Shonen_hero> UI spoiler basically
[1:57:23] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt considering that cutscene, just a reminder that the first game had NO camera rotation at all only zoom
[1:57:24] <Orenjevel> Lmao look at his shadow
[1:57:24] <%linSP> 2 spells!
[1:57:31] <%cooldude69xx> @alphonseisbest they cosmicallt outrank dragons, but theres a couple specific dragons that could put up an even fight
[1:57:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> @GarbageNirvana I mean she vaporizes a couple lesser demons.
[1:57:33] <quantras6> @joodatious to be fair she tried to 1v1 a demigod
[1:57:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow spell slots
[1:57:34] <%alphonseisbest> @alphonseisbest so if she HAD no chance, why did she call him out like that? thats just asking for death
[1:57:35] <heartlesshealer> they really just jobbed a whole metallic dragon
[1:57:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> Deskari is just so damn powerful.
[1:57:46] <%bevyrage> simple doesn't mean it's not complex, it means that it's easy to use.
[1:57:47] <shockmaster3> the first game didnt have a lot of things
[1:57:47] <%Ghufufin> the first game needed a ton of mods to be playable
[1:57:48] <+Shonen_hero> yeah they had to mod the camera rotation in
[1:57:49] <%Caped_Eggy> @HotSauceFiend No, this is more like Divinity
[1:57:52] <+maffewsus> The shadow cast by his light onto his hat Kappa
[1:57:52] <DSD24> Yes it does
[1:57:57] <tanarath> yeee, underdark
[1:58:00] <%sandrews> wait so is this a sequel or dlc?
[1:58:04] <DSD24> Caves have high Frame Rate
[1:58:10] <%redthebaron> bit of a jank situation
[1:58:10] <%IamGrapes> @alphonseisbest dragons be arrogent like that
[1:58:10] <%BinaryFireball> is this better than the last pathfinder game?
[1:58:10] <%SinnerEbru> turns out: it eas just NPCs
[1:58:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is a sequel.
[1:58:12] <DSD24> @sandrews New Sequel Game
[1:58:15] <quantras6> @heartlesshealer one of the paths is becoming a golden dragon btw
[1:58:20] <T_Sasquatch> Oh hi Mark
[1:58:22] <%alphonseisbest> @alphonseisbest lul
[1:58:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> holy mother of ungh
[1:58:23] <+DerivedKnight> @heartlesshealer Definitely couldn't have been a very powerful or old Dragon. She just got put on a T-Shirt fast as fuck.
[1:58:26] <+DragonArt07> turning off shadows can help
[1:58:27] <heartlesshealer> Silver Dragons are basically paladins, so that's why she challenged anyway, but at least let her breath weapon out to get deflected or something
[1:58:27] <%BinaryFireball> is the writing goodish?
[1:58:28] <+IxDomxI> this is a different campaign module, not a sequel
[1:58:29] <reasonance> @sandrews not a "sequel", story unrelated, but yes next game
[1:58:30] <MemAlephh> yeah this game's performance freaks out in large areas
[1:58:36] <%HotSauceFiend> you gained experience for watching this woman in pain
[1:58:39] <SaltyAzteca> YOU LOOK COOL, GET IN
[1:58:39] <+kawachipto> It's the next game, not a sequel
[1:58:40] <%IamGrapes> yo its Seelah
[1:58:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> I really don't like Seelah but I know I'm in the minority.
[1:58:43] <%IamGrapes> she's awesome
[1:58:44] <DSD24> The writing is good in this game
[1:58:51] <+AugustRei> shout out to seelah
[1:58:54] <%NopeBadguy> EVIL
[1:58:54] <Chaos_Aether> who?
[1:58:55] <%vaporousTippler> This game has more classes, more features, and more bugs. Different feel to its story entirely.
[1:58:58] <MemAlephh> @BinaryFireball its generic but fun. companion writing carries it imo
[1:58:59] <+AugustRei> love her in the adventure card game
[1:59:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> your back should actually be multiple pieces
[1:59:00] <%linSP> (Evil)
[1:59:00] <+Pendragwn> ROLL TO SEDUCE
[1:59:03] <DSD24> Seelah's a real one
[1:59:05] <quantras6> I don't like Seelah because she's mean to Ember
[1:59:12] <$lotharrio> I'm not super happy with some of the line reads.
[1:59:12] <%baka_sugoi> ROLL
[1:59:15] <+Aullama> Skill checks? Oh, you mean reload checks? danEZ
[1:59:20] <shockmaster3> I like that a lot of the time you can just tell people to pay you
[1:59:20] <+Squidbit> just got here, what kinda character did pat roll?
[1:59:25] <quantras6> even Wenduag is nice to Ember at times
[1:59:25] <%TheWinged7> 4 LUL
[1:59:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> Boy does it.
[1:59:30] <%TheFabledAble> yep
[1:59:30] <Chaos_Aether> 4
[1:59:31] <+Shonen_hero> a bit
[1:59:31] <%redthebaron> this is a dungeon and dragons game
[1:59:32] <%sandrews> @reasonance @DSD24 thanks for the answer
[1:59:32] <ToneBacas> how so?
[1:59:35] <Badgerconda_> yes.
[1:59:35] <tanarath> Roll to bard, pat
[1:59:35] <joodatious> well aside from BG3
[1:59:36] <Chaos_Aether> Mega4
[1:59:37] <PwnyB> Oh no... I tried to close the UI out of habit..
[1:59:38] <+Immortalsblade> It does
[1:59:38] <$yeknomlive> cg inquis
[1:59:40] <%alphonseisbest> @BinaryFireball hows the first games writing stack compared o Baldurs?
[1:59:41] <MemAlephh> a little bit?
[1:59:45] <DSD24> @Squidbit Inquisitor basically a cleric with Judgespells
[1:59:45] <%hrbeck_> @Squidbit ugly bastard dwarf
[1:59:46] <%HolePunchLeaf> Pillars got kinda close, but Pathfinder is on another level
[1:59:48] <quantras6> @squidbit CG melee Inquisitor of Gorum
[1:59:48] <%BinaryFireball> @MemAlephh ah thanks, I didnt really enjoy the writing in the first game
[1:59:50] <enreimirai> Pat rolled a dorf inquisitor going melee focus
[1:59:52] <$mattynezz> Yes. Because of a SECRET mechanic
[1:59:53] <Badgerconda_> The first one was VERY ambitious compared to the Pillars games, for sure.
[1:59:56] <+MisterAvry> chaotic good, member
[2:00:02] <%NopeBadguy> They're all DC12

[2:01:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Do you remember Pillars 1 where there's the skill check to save the thief? This is that.
[2:01:01] <CruxAustralis> f9
[2:01:03] <leinadtonu> good job!
[2:01:03] <Badgerconda_> Don't get all OCD freak out about this Pat, it is not a big deal at all.

[2:01:16] <Sol_Install> you were 1 away wow

[2:01:21] <$mattynezz> LUL
[2:01:22] <MemAlephh> LOL
[2:01:22] <%vaporousTippler> Time to bury the dice and buy new ones.
[2:01:23] <ScarletPrime> This and Kingmaker are adaptations of Pathfinder Adventure Paths for the tabletop. Writing and usually timeline wise, Kingmaker was AP 6, and this is AP 13.
[2:01:24] <%Sotetsu> F5 is quick save, F8 is quick load. Woooo!
[2:01:25] <+DragonArt07> save scum
[2:01:29] <%TungstenViper> THIS is why D&D mechanics don't work in videogames
[2:01:34] <+Shonen_hero> if Pat resets after every botched social roll he'll be at this for a while
[2:01:40] <%cooldude69xx> "Whoopsie, guess my legs broke tee hee"
[2:01:40] <DSD24> Anevia's cool
[2:01:46] <%Sotetsu> Nothing wrong with save scumming.
[2:01:49] <quantras6> Can't wait for "Open your heart to me :^)" girl to show up
[2:01:50] <%alphonseisbest> @TungstenViper THIS!
[2:01:54] <+Immortalsblade> The dumbest part is I'm pretty sure you have guidance so you could have gotten a bonus
[2:01:55] <elwynnster> I prefer the fallout new Vegas way of doing things where you either have enough skill points or not. None of this rng
[2:01:56] <akitanito> real DMs are flexible, video game DMs are hard ass
[2:02:02] <Madinki> @TungstenViper THIS!
[2:02:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> nothing wrong with letting your failure rock either
[2:02:10] <+Immortalsblade> If the game let you cast Guidance
[2:02:16] <mostundesired> Just got here, class and race? (Dwarf, right?)
[2:02:17] <%TungstenViper> @TungstenViper THIS!
[2:02:26] <+Shonen_hero> it does let you cast guidance
[2:02:27] <+kawachipto> I like the choas of the rolls in this game
[2:02:27] <+DerivedKnight> @TungstenViper Why? Succeed or fail the story still advances and nothing is wrong here. Don't see why this doesn't *work*
[2:02:28] <%alphonseisbest> @ReallyBigRocks THERE i9s when is stops u having fun
[2:02:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> @mostundesired Dwarf Inquisitor
[2:02:34] <+Shonen_hero> it's an orisen
[2:02:34] <$zyberion626> Evil [Athletics 19] Deprive dog of bone
[2:02:44] <Orenjevel> None of the *really* important choices are skill checks so you're fine to just fail over and over
[2:02:44] <%vaporousTippler> This game can be brutal, but it's why it has tons of difficulty options.
[2:02:45] <MemAlephh> the problem with systems like these is that none of these games know how to make failing skill checks interesting. disco elysium is literally the only exception that comes to mnd
[2:02:49] <%alphonseisbest> @TungstenViper cuz its not fun for ALOT aof folk
[2:02:52] <Explodincatz> ghost arm
[2:02:55] <+Immortalsblade> @Shonen_hero Not in the dialogue
[2:02:58] <quantras6> @elwynnster I think there should be some influence over it but ultimately a element of luck, like pat's modifier gave him a better chance but the game still rolled a d20
[2:03:01] <%vaporousTippler> Because actually playing a TTRPG by the book is always a bad time.
[2:03:01] <%cooldude69xx> "Go to the bathroom" or "hack in bonuses?"
[2:03:05] <+maffewsus> [Interfacing: Formidable]
[2:03:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> @alphonseisbest if failed rolls are gonna ruin your fun then this probably isn't the genre for you
[2:03:19] <+Immortalsblade> You have to know ahead of time there'll be a roll coming up
[2:03:35] <%TungstenViper> @DerivedKnight because the task resulting in a fail just casue you're skill check or roll wasn't successful it's neither fun or fair ina videogame.
[2:03:52] <+DerivedKnight> My favorite part about this? People are saying it isn't fun to do...what exactly here? If he succeeded he pulled her out. He failed, she still got out. Literally same thing happened pass or faila nd people still are like 'Well that isn't fun.'
[2:04:00] <akitanito> Because failing checks in games is usually bad versus a real sessions where the DM and players can improvise
[2:04:04] <Madinki> @TungstenViper Damn right!
[2:04:16] <+DerivedKnight> @TungstenViper Fun or fair? Hello? RPGs? Literally games that are based upon chance systems of percentiles.
[2:04:22] <+Immortalsblade> @DerivedKnight Because fatigue is absolutely horrific
[2:04:22] <%alphonseisbest> @ReallyBigRocks yea thats a lame ass response dude, theres ways to work with this, just look at F:NV no-one had an issue with the with that did skill checks
[2:04:32] <%vaporousTippler> Sometimes things go bad. Not everyone can handle that.
[2:04:39] <+kawachipto> this chat full of babies on both sides LUL
[2:04:40] <%cooldude69xx> @DerivedKnight People expect to be in full control at all times in a video game for some reason
[2:04:46] <quantras6> personally I find both approaches have faults, but I wish more game's did shit like Arcanums persuasion.
[2:04:46] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight No. EXHAUSTION is horrific. Fatigue is a bump in the road.
[2:04:59] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:05:00] <%redthebaron> fair
[2:05:02] <boggycrook> ENDURANCE - You are pathetic, coach. What the hell are those muscles for if you cannot even lift a damn rock?
[2:05:03] <%SpoonheadInExile> LUL
[2:05:03] <joodatious> kinda
[2:05:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> @alphonseisbest yeah because its a different style of rpg, there's plenty more like it
[2:05:05] <%vaporousTippler> Kingmaker is a lot more fixed and stable than Wrath currently is. But Wrath has more stuff.
[2:05:06] <joodatious> still buggy
[2:05:06] <%TungstenViper> @DerivedKnight yes, there are some mechanics on RPGs that requrie rng to work, but theire balanced and thought around the videogame first to make it fun
[2:05:06] <+kawachipto> This game is much better than kingmaker
[2:05:09] <SolumFuturae> fair
[2:05:09] <+DragonArt07> This is way better then kingmaker
[2:05:10] <Badgerconda_> The thing is that there's no point to a random chance failure that just makes the player feel bad and isn't fun. It's not great design, but it's also not a big deal
[2:05:13] <+Immortalsblade> Yeah this game is uh.... VERY broken at the moment
[2:05:16] <%BinaryFireball> pat it feels like where in that part of the year when there are very few games released
[2:05:16] <%TheFabledAble> one bad experience is all it takes huh
[2:05:18] <+kawachipto> this game is finished wtf
[2:05:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> You might want the Kingmaker mod that pauses the doom calendar
[2:05:23] <MemAlephh> i literally have no idea why more crpgs dont just copy the way new vegas did skill checks other than "but its like the tabletop"
[2:05:23] <%BinaryFireball> its like fuck you it's ....september
[2:05:28] <Lefanque> As someone who is in the endgame of this game, it is NOT FINISHED
[2:05:29] <+HawkeInitiative> KIngmakers, kingdom building is kinda rough, I found the crusade mechanics to be way more fun
[2:05:42] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight If they want full control without a chance to miss a target or fail something, that's why they don't play RPGs yeah.
[2:05:42] <joodatious> how is this game fully released and DOSNT have a dice rolling animation
[2:05:46] <slix3431> The dialogue in this game is pain
[2:05:47] <%alphonseisbest> @MemAlephh right?!
[2:05:47] <+Immortalsblade> It's "finished" in the slav sense of the word. IE literally everything is broken
[2:05:48] <%Meekest> Kingdom?
[2:05:49] <%NateyBeak> he called his dog kingdom...
[2:05:50] <CappuccinoGuil> wait, is this not finished?
[2:05:50] <quantras6> @memalephh because that also sucks.
[2:05:51] <%TungstenViper> @DerivedKnight sorry for the poor grammar...
[2:05:51] <%Wallabri> Kingdom of Gief
[2:05:58] <%SpoonheadInExile> "I am Blorgafell, chosen of Sakan Mainats"
[2:05:59] <+Pendragwn> THE MIND GOBLINS BEGIN
[2:06:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Guys people are being eaten up there.
[2:06:09] <+Erictron4000> Cohn didn’t get minor glitches yet
[2:06:10] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> More lie ASS Finder, Path of the RIGHT TITS macawRomero
[2:06:15] <%Reveresao> no
[2:06:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[2:06:16] <gyde42> I personally thing having to deal with failure and finding alternate ways to succeed is what makes these games fun
[2:06:18] <TheFramedWarlock> Pat WILL have his kingdom
[2:06:20] <%vaporousTippler> The game is "finished" but buggy as hell. Kingmaker was worse on launch.
[2:06:26] <dreadedcthulhu> im pat widepeepoHappy
[2:06:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> I love how condescending she sounded.
[2:06:31] <huskarl_zap> Kingdom these is my kingdom come
[2:06:35] <$zyberion626> Seelah is here to kill demons and make friends
[2:06:36] <Madinki> @MemAlephh RIGHT?!
[2:06:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hi, I'm Elfo
[2:06:43] <+kawachipto> I'd say this game is more stable than kingmaker is today
[2:06:54] <+Immortalsblade> Unlike Kingmaker this game launched with the exe
[2:06:58] <%vaporousTippler> Nah, Kingmaker glitches far less.
[2:06:59] <%TungstenViper> @DerivedKnight the point is, he didn't actaully try to save her. the game decided Stats =7= required skill --> fail.
[2:07:00] <%king_wragles> I like her
[2:07:01] <akitanito> hurrhurr
[2:07:02] <%king_wragles> she's a dork
[2:07:06] <slix3431> The dialogue is terrible
[2:07:07] <+Shonen_hero> She is and I love her
[2:07:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah I don't like Seelah for this reason.
[2:07:09] <%tank7013> She sounds like she's talking to children
[2:07:11] <%TheFabledAble> ex theif trying to be goody toe shoes
[2:07:12] <%alphonseisbest> @kawachipto no way that games been getting updates for years.. HOW?
[2:07:13] <dizimous> I think she's nice
[2:07:14] <+Shonen_hero> She does her best
[2:07:16] <%laserbeaming> She's the dweebest paladin
[2:07:19] <%redthebaron> biggest dork in town like all the paladins
[2:07:20] <+JJJKopf> she's a paladin, they have to be dweebs
[2:07:20] <quantras6> @gyde42 this, failure is fun but too many get upset at not having the optimal outcome
[2:07:21] <%SpoonheadInExile> Oh no. This stinks of Joss Whedon
[2:07:22] <MemAlephh> She's suuuuch a blockhead i love her
[2:07:23] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> *awkward laughter*
[2:07:25] <enreimirai> I find this game more stable than kingmaker. Also vastly better companions
[2:07:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> She acts like a dork during the darkest days where you're fighting Satan.
[2:07:26] <$zyberion626> she's the pathfinder system's iconic Paladin
[2:07:27] <+GimmMeASammich> Eww lawful good
[2:07:27] <joodatious> the voice acting seems odd
[2:07:32] <scrumbotime> That's a good Paladin right there, they love to talk with all that charisma
[2:07:35] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Select yer bloody party, ye dickhead
[2:07:36] <+AugustRei> she has a broke leg pat
[2:07:37] <$mattynezz> She's a Paladin, so she's a "Hello, fellow kids" kind of Holy person
[2:07:37] <+AugustRei> she can't fight
[2:07:38] <%Gogogolem> leg broke
[2:07:41] <SaltyAzteca> A dweeb paladin, a one legged archer, and a n aggressive holy dwarf
[2:07:42] <gyde42> @quantras6 exactly!
[2:07:45] <DSD24> At least she isn’t Lawful Stupid
[2:07:49] <%sw_paladin> YOU'RE A DWEEB
[2:07:56] <tanarath> No, some are better.
[2:07:57] <+Shonen_hero> yeah they are just generic actions basically
[2:08:03] <%chiazam> Pat she was rockslided
[2:08:07] <%TheFabledAble> you can
[2:08:07] <%laserbeaming> you can
[2:08:09] <+Shonen_hero> yes
[2:08:12] <Orenjevel> look at her she's limping
[2:08:13] <%laserbeaming> and you should
[2:08:14] <RedSqurrl> Order of the Stick reference. Pog
[2:08:15] <$lotharrio> Probably
[2:08:15] <$mattynezz> Charge is really good
[2:08:17] <+DeadPhoenix3> you cant cahrge with a crossbow
[2:08:19] <+JJJKopf> you don't have a melee weapon
[2:08:22] <%TheFabledAble> because you didnt put it on there you dweeb
[2:08:22] <+AugustRei> keep charge on pat
[2:08:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> because you didn't put it there
[2:08:23] <$yeknomlive> she's an mvc1 assist
[2:08:23] <%alphonseisbest> @quantras6 nah u 2 are just weird
[2:08:24] <%Ghufufin> you have a crosssbow
[2:08:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> Charge attack is just getting a run up to hit them
[2:08:25] <tanarath> Because you don't want to, you're not built to be a fist wizard
[2:08:26] <+AugustRei> oh yeah that's true
[2:08:28] <CruxAustralis> charge is very good
[2:08:28] <MemAlephh> seelah is like the cool counselor in church camp that lets you say fuck
[2:08:30] <%vaporousTippler> Imagining Pat at a tabletop session is...oh boy.
[2:08:34] <chaosbringer28> no melee weapon, and shes more fighty type
[2:08:45] <quantras6> @gyde42 like there are some stuff you should reload for especially if the game wasn't clear on the option (Like Witcher 3's "push Dikstjra aside forcefully)
[2:08:50] <%laserbeaming> the game assumes you'll play a ranged inquisitor because that's the recommended build
[2:08:50] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight He did try to save them. The skill was rolled and RNG said 'just missed'. It's like looking at Fallout New Vegas with your Persuasion chances and then when you fail going 'I didn't have control of that' when it rolls a d100 against the percentage you have trained.
[2:08:51] <+Rofiarf> the first formation changes based on what party is
[2:08:55] <Orenjevel> no melee weapon equipped
[2:08:56] <DSD24> Formations!
[2:08:57] <CruxAustralis> Inspecting is very useful
[2:09:09] <%watts121> Is....pat's toon wearing a pimp hat?
[2:09:09] <%alphonseisbest> @vaporousTippler either everyone at the table would hate him, or he would hate it LUL
[2:09:13] <+HawkeInitiative> what god is he an inquisitor of?
[2:09:13] <+Shonen_hero> yeah after you kill a creature, you press that option and click the body. It'll give a stat blurb about them and their abilities
[2:09:14] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I imagine any table top session involving Pat ended in blood.
[2:09:23] <quantras6> @alphonseisbest sorry to have a a different opinion to you then
[2:09:23] <tanarath> steal all
[2:09:27] <DSD24> @watts121 Inquistor Hat
[2:09:30] <%SinnerEbru> honestly plotting a crpg list to pick up the genre, pathfinder might be amongst my last
[2:09:34] <CruxAustralis> @DerivedKnight there are other checks that change outcomes, this one is the tutorial
[2:09:35] <akitanito> oh no weight mechanics
[2:09:35] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is this D&D?
[2:09:37] <%redthebaron> big sword
[2:09:38] <%TheFabledAble> OUCH

[2:09:44] <+MisterAvry> shit yeah
[2:09:45] <zerointelligence000> why is your dick horizontal
[2:09:45] <+Rofiarf> pat cut his penis off!
[2:09:47] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> It clips though yer armor, but your penis?
[2:09:47] <$zyberion626> PENISWORD
[2:09:49] <joodatious> @TurtlesAndTentacles yes but no
[2:09:50] <AzureGale> WIENER SWORD

[2:09:55] <MemAlephh> has anyone told him this game has encumbrance LUL
[2:09:55] <%linSP> its bigger than you
[2:09:56] <%space_penguin> How long did he end up in he char creator?
[2:09:56] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Nah, not even close
[2:09:57] <DSD24> This is alternate DND
[2:09:57] <%redthebaron> @TurtlesAndTentacles catholic d&d
[2:09:58] <%Piemono> Under inventory
[2:09:59] <tanarath> There's weighf

[2:10:02] <%Gogogolem> under you character
[2:10:02] <+nikoloas_> carry weight
[2:10:03] <MrChaosDoughnut> Why would they keep weight.
[2:10:04] <%YakumoYomi> BORK
[2:10:04] <+MisterAvry> like max carry weight?
[2:10:04] <+pectusumbra> yes but you probably are okay
[2:10:04] <%DoubleRrico> real men use a sword taller than them
[2:10:04] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> KISS THAT NAUGHTY BOY, PAT
[2:10:06] <@Ranryu692> under the character viewer
[2:10:07] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt below the usable items
[2:10:09] <chaosbringer28> bottom middle of screen, above char select
[2:10:10] <+Rofiarf> below your character is personal weight, below inventory is group weight
[2:10:10] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:10:10] <$mattynezz> LUL
[2:10:11] <%SinnerEbru> rip
[2:10:12] <%redthebaron> under your character too
[2:10:12] <+DeadPhoenix3> pat doesn't carry about encumbrance because dwarf
[2:10:15] <joodatious> Pathfinder is the Shasta to DNDs Coke
[2:10:16] <%watts121> wait Pat's an inquisitor? Those are just skinny paladins
[2:10:21] <tanarath> BUT YOU HAVE FRIENDS AKA MULES
[2:10:21] <+Shonen_hero> yeah there's weight limits and weight encumbarance
[2:10:21] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight yea but ur missing that F:NV only has a hard skill point to hit and it either works or doesn't, also many folk don't like RNG systems in games
[2:10:21] <%Reveresao> rip game
[2:10:23] <+MisterAvry> haw haw haw!
[2:10:24] <+Shonen_hero> You cannot escape it
[2:10:24] <%linSP> CANT LOOT EVERYTHING
[2:10:25] <+JustToWatch> you can turn that off under difficulty
[2:10:26] <joodatious> game ruined
[2:10:26] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you can get bag of holding like in baldurs gate its fine dont worry about it
[2:10:28] <penitentpendant> Loot restrictions~
[2:10:29] <scrumbotime> Dwarves are Very Good at carrying things at least
[2:10:30] <%vaporousTippler> At least you don't have to carry rations in this game.
[2:10:31] <+Pendragwn> You're big strong you can carry a lot
[2:10:32] <+DragonArt07> you can carry alot
[2:10:33] <%redthebaron> put cape
[2:10:33] <DSD24> It’s not that bad Pat
[2:10:33] <+Rofiarf> put the cape on!!!
[2:10:34] <enreimirai> you have infinite storage tho, so
[2:10:35] <%laserbeaming> you are strong, you won't worry about weight
[2:10:36] <+JJJKopf> and now you see the reason people install the cheat mod
[2:10:36] <Orenjevel> As a dwarf you can just ignore weight mechanics
[2:10:36] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Use nun-chucks
[2:10:37] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[2:10:37] <akitanito> that's true
[2:10:38] <scrumbotime> you're Pre-Slow!
[2:10:38] <viewtifulr> no more pack rat pat
[2:10:39] <+churchraptor> your arm overextends and makes your elbow freak out, lol
[2:10:41] <%Ghufufin> cape
[2:10:42] <+maffewsus> put on cape!
[2:10:44] <+DragonArt07> you can turn off weight
[2:10:44] <$mattynezz> That cape
[2:10:45] <%BoxNavy> AHH! psaDogchamp
[2:10:48] <%Ghufufin> wear teh cloaker
[2:10:50] <$zyberion626> put the cape on @PatStaresAt
[2:10:50] <+kawachipto> this is true
[2:10:53] <+GimmMeASammich> Put on cape
[2:10:54] <%athuramn> good thing it's just lodged right in there for extra maneuverability
[2:10:59] <%IamGrapes> @PatStaresAt that only works with armor
[2:11:04] <%alphonseisbest> u can turn that off in the options if u want
[2:11:05] <MemAlephh> honestly the encumbrance is very generous as long as you're only picking up stuff thats actually worth selling
[2:11:12] <+Shonen_hero> oh yeah it's not great
[2:11:13] <+Shonen_hero> I love it
[2:11:13] <akitanito> everything's clipping
[2:11:18] <+Aullama> The clipping coxPog
[2:11:20] <zerointelligence000> that cloak runs on 2 frames
[2:11:20] <%linSP> clip clip clip!
[2:11:21] <%SirGO0SE> pats a beard chewin' coal kissing dorf
[2:11:22] <BlackStarAura> DOUBLE PIMP
[2:11:23] <scrumbotime> I just wrapped up a D&D 5e session a little bit ago, everyone loves Dwarves.
[2:11:25] <%redthebaron> from the dragon
[2:11:29] <+maffewsus> omg everything is falling apart
[2:11:31] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt don't spend the scales they are important
[2:11:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Acquired Loser's scale
[2:11:32] <+Shonen_hero> you can use that, but I wouldn't
[2:11:36] <+Aullama> Dragon waifu's scale FeelsBadMan
[2:11:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> must be a big scale to weigh a dragon
[2:11:38] <%Monkeyweed21> lol her scale
[2:11:39] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Hell yeah, this game sucks! psa2guy psa2guy psa2guy
[2:11:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> From the dragon who died. Terendelav.
[2:11:41] <+Shonen_hero> they are important later
[2:11:42] <%NateyBeak> why him borfk psaDogchamp
[2:11:44] <CruxAustralis> DO NOT USE THE SCALES @PatStaresAt
[2:11:44] <%linSP> she shouldve used that scale on herself
[2:11:46] <akitanito> only she is
[2:11:48] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Lit as all hell
[2:11:50] <TioXyco> -2
[2:11:51] <%vaporousTippler> Well there's personal encumbrance for your gear loadout, then there's party encumbrance that's shared.
[2:11:54] <%WhereIsWill> its lit fam
[2:11:54] <%Agami23> only one lit
[2:11:59] <+MisterAvry> she's lit, famb
[2:12:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> lol expecting Pat to use an item
[2:12:06] <akitanito> I can't believe pat already has a harem
[2:12:07] <+DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt important make sure to save a scale for later. it's very important
[2:12:07] <%TheFabledAble> she is the best
[2:12:13] <%TheFabledAble> murder horny elf
[2:12:14] <Orenjevel> pheonix down
[2:12:16] <+JJJKopf> cam cam
[2:12:16] <%vaporousTippler> Wow. That description probably shouldn't have been skipped so fast.
[2:12:16] <MemAlephh> whats wrong with the scales. arent they just scrolls of raise dead
[2:12:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Camellia is the best.
[2:12:25] <+kawachipto> I love her...and that scares me
[2:12:27] <AzureGale> I'm Pat
[2:12:29] <+MisterAvry> she cute
[2:12:30] <quantras6> Camellia a shit
[2:12:35] <DSD24> Its Rich Gal
[2:12:36] <%Deft_Thought> MY NAME IS HOV--nevermind
[2:12:36] <quantras6> t. Aeon
[2:12:36] <%athuramn> "this is our new friend" what a weird way to say your name
[2:12:38] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight F:NV had skill points for every skill available to your character in the game. The only thing that wasn't involved in RNG is your combat abilities and even those are still RNG as you have Critical Chances that are rolled every time you take a shot. If people don't want RNG chances for that, there's games for those options. That aren't 'RPGs'
[2:12:38] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Is he saying Pat or Pac?
[2:12:45] <%laserbeaming> She's fucked up
[2:12:45] <%chiazam> damn building the girl squad kinda fast
[2:12:47] <%moonmintparadise> More like Ca-Smelly
[2:12:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> More games need the option to only ever say one thing
[2:12:53] <scrumbotime> @MemAlephh Presumably the Life Restoring Magic Scales of a dragon will have a little more potential uses than a scroll
[2:12:55] <MemAlephh> camellia great unless you have shit taste
[2:12:58] <%crazyspartan214> Is Pat building a harem?
[2:12:58] <akitanito> feels vtuber ish
[2:13:01] <Scrub_Seeker> @MemAlephh they're needed to unlock the Gold Dragon mythic path
[2:13:04] <joodatious> it sounds uhhh
[2:13:06] <%TheFabledAble> sounds B tier
[2:13:11] <DSD24> @athuramn Well cause you can have any name that had to do something
[2:13:12] <$zyberion626> semi-pro
[2:13:15] <%SinnerEbru> it sounds like college/grad students kinda
[2:13:15] <%TheFabledAble> lol yea
[2:13:15] <%redthebaron> it does
[2:13:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> This was a kickstarter after all.
[2:13:17] <%linSP> B+
[2:13:18] <%Gogogolem> yes
[2:13:19] <%Shikari21> i love it
[2:13:20] <zerointelligence000> it sounds kinda indie
[2:13:22] <quantras6> @memalephh wrong. I will judge her as a Aeon
[2:13:23] <%Agami23> that sounds about right
[2:13:23] <+GimmMeASammich> This is DnD podcast level
[2:13:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> It makes it seem a little more like real people
[2:13:24] <DSD24> Just like real DND
[2:13:24] <%vaporousTippler> Camellia's voice acting is very purposeful.
[2:13:25] <+DerivedKnight> So it's a D&D game~ Hell yeah
[2:13:25] <%Shikari21> it works
[2:13:26] <+Shonen_hero> aw but I love it
[2:13:26] <%moonmintparadise> it sounds like they had to do a lot of it
[2:13:26] <%NateyBeak> I kinda dig that
[2:13:26] <%drabberfaun535> its overacted
[2:13:27] <penitentpendant> It's weirdly apropos
[2:13:27] <+Speed1ines> it sounds very earnest
[2:13:29] <%HolePunchLeaf> recording from home might have had something to do with it
[2:13:29] <+Shonen_hero> okay good LUL
[2:13:30] <dizimous> Damn. I think you're kinda right, fuck
[2:13:30] <joodatious> it sounds like a less professional critical roll
[2:13:33] <TioXyco> ah yes, that Resident Evil feel on the voice acting
[2:13:34] <%athuramn> so Bang Brethren
[2:13:34] <+kingdinkyI> I like the vibe
[2:13:35] <@Ranryu692> sus
[2:13:36] <SolumFuturae> I like it
[2:13:36] <%redthebaron> sadly
[2:13:37] <+MisterAvry> so a lot of podcasts that aren't Critical Role?
[2:13:37] <%Daxalog> Our finest Newground audio artists!
[2:13:39] <%sandrews> gets that table top feel?
[2:13:42] <+TreskM> sus
[2:13:43] <%Kyma1020> Sounds like people Role Playing instead of pro vo
[2:13:43] <hambeerpig> I feel like it's the writing rather than just the actors
[2:13:44] <+kawachipto> I like the voice acting more in this than those games tbh
[2:13:44] <scrumbotime> "He was definitely dead" SAYS THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE SKULL NECKLACE
[2:13:45] <retrobanner> He died of a heart attack
[2:13:48] <$zyberion626> HMMMM
[2:13:53] <ScarletPrime> F for my bro Araveshnial. Sir cut out of this story.
[2:13:54] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Slightly awkward. semi professional is the aesthetic of this game, I'm pretty sure.
[2:13:56] <%TheFabledAble> @scrumbotime that also has a rapier
[2:14:02] <MemAlephh> i didnt mind most of the voice acting. except lann's who i think is dogshit
[2:14:03] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight what?! who cares if u get a crit? if u hit ur shot u hit ur shot in F:NV all that mattered was ur skill stat( that u controlled) and ur aim, ALOT less rng involved
[2:14:11] <%chiazam> are you sure it wasn’t her
[2:14:12] <akitanito> better double check his wounds to make sure
[2:14:18] <DSD24> Die?
[2:14:19] <%IamGrapes> wait hold on
[2:14:21] <%watts121> this worth? King Maker sucked
[2:14:22] <@QueequegTheater> Has he found his Path yet
[2:14:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> she coulda at least hit him once tbh
[2:14:28] <+kawachipto> yeah lann was drunk when he read his lines LUL
[2:14:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> You'd have to have a really big penis to fight a guy like that. Too bad we don't know anyone like that!
[2:14:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> @BlowFireThroatTotem Honestly it's a good aesthetic, very honest lol
[2:14:37] <retrobanner> HEART. ATTACK.
[2:14:39] <%Reveresao> lies
[2:14:39] <+Shonen_hero> and you Cam, we can always rely on you Cam
[2:14:40] <akitanito> ofc
[2:14:43] <%IamGrapes> if the dragon's scale can raise dead... woudlnt the whole body, yknow, regenerate?
[2:14:43] <quantras6> @queequegtheater he'll run into the angel option shortly
[2:14:46] <@goose_attack_almanac> wow that sounds suspicious as shit\
[2:14:47] <%crazyspartan214> liles
[2:14:51] <+RoeDeerRootie> she shady as fuq
[2:14:52] <%Puhff> I would simply not build my city near demons
[2:14:53] <%alphonseisbest> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ right LUL dragon got JOBBED
[2:14:56] <%SABiscotti> Only trust your fists, the Demigods will never help you
[2:14:56] <enreimirai> so pat, KEEP ON THE AUTOMATIC PROGRESSION FOR HER
[2:14:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> She seems cool
[2:15:00] <joodatious> wow i hate her already
[2:15:03] <scrumbotime> This woman talks like how I talk when I'm playing a Warlock
[2:15:04] <quantras6> Camellia a shit
[2:15:05] <%Ghufufin> magus
[2:15:07] <%CopperTucker> not everyone can be the Ivory King
[2:15:08] <%linSP> she wants the pat
[2:15:08] <jbrachob> Is that a fucking runaway princess?
[2:15:10] <%laserbeaming> she's got the most awkward build in the game
[2:15:10] <enreimirai> she has THE SINGLE MOST COMPLICATED BUILD IN THE ENTIRE GAME
[2:15:12] <%alphonseisbest> WOW FUCK her
[2:15:13] <+MisterAvry> "Wanna sit next to me at lunch?"
[2:15:15] <@QueequegTheater> @quantras6 Wait I was joking
[2:15:15] <Parapattern> She seems evil as shit
[2:15:16] <quantras6> This comment was made by Aeon gang
[2:15:16] <enreimirai> game auto-handles her lvling stuff
[2:15:17] <chaosbringer28> this is a CN rogue, she EXUDES that energy
[2:15:18] <%Questiy> Yoshikage Camellia wanted a quiet lofe
[2:15:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> He's talking about waifu shit.
[2:15:21] <+kingdinkyI> you don't want to deal with her build
[2:15:22] <$lotharrio> They mean don't multiclass
[2:15:22] <CruxAustralis> auto level up
[2:15:23] <%Piemono> That's just auto level
[2:15:24] <%SpoonheadInExile> auto-leveling?
[2:15:24] <%vaporousTippler> Don't worry. She is useful.
[2:15:25] <%DovaDude29> Sevdiddles
[2:15:26] <%alphonseisbest> AUTO LEVEL
[2:15:26] <mikeriffic> I to have been playing this game and idk what I am doing
[2:15:28] <MemAlephh> it means auto level
[2:15:33] <CruxAustralis> don't keep it on
[2:15:34] <%TheFabledAble> her build is really not that complicated
[2:15:34] <tanarath> Automatic level progresion
[2:15:37] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight I mean obviously you do, cause Crit does more damage. So why doesn't the game gives me Crits all the time everytime I shoot? Man, this RNG ruins it that I don't get these.
[2:15:39] <CruxAustralis> do it manually
[2:15:42] <%chiazam> ew auto levels
[2:15:45] <CruxAustralis> it's good to get a hang of the classes
[2:15:49] <+kawachipto> She is good, but can be hard to spec
[2:15:54] <tanarath> Why would you auto progress, though?
[2:15:55] <$mattynezz> @patstaresat look at her equipment
[2:15:58] <+Shonen_hero> it's set to it automatically
[2:15:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ I think that's the hardest and quickest I ever saw a dragon job, kinda amazing
[2:16:04] <%SpoonheadInExile> You are NOT allowed to say 'bloke' with a Yank accent. I say that as a Yank myself
[2:16:04] <Scrub_Seeker> hey check out camellia's alignment
[2:16:05] <joodatious> the VAs are good but the writing sounds translated and kinda awkward
[2:16:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Just joined has Pat done any Demonic Warcrimes yet?
[2:16:09] <quantras6> Open your heart to me :^)
[2:16:09] <enreimirai> the issue is shes a tad more complex than others
[2:16:10] <%redthebaron> check her biography
[2:16:11] <+Shonen_hero> when they level up
[2:16:11] <%Lefanque> it does it itself
[2:16:12] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt check her alignment on the character screen
[2:16:12] <scrumbotime> Undetectable is always a good alignment
[2:16:14] <%NopeBadguy> more like cure SHITE wounds
[2:16:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> They would've just told you if you'd read it Pat.
[2:16:17] <%Questiy> ffs Pat it was RIGHT THERE
[2:16:18] <%laserbeaming> she's got the most fucked up newbie unfriendly class in the game
[2:16:18] <+TimeToChrom> Man this voice acting is actually great
[2:16:19] <+kingdinkyI> don't worry about it until you get there
[2:16:22] <DSD24> Undetectable huh?
[2:16:24] <$zyberion626> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ wasn't even a fight she got one shot
[2:16:26] <MemAlephh> i didnt think she was that hard to raise? i didnt take a single multiclass and she performs well
[2:16:26] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight its not about doing more damage, it about doing any damage vs no damage at all due to shitty rng
[2:16:26] <dreadedcthulhu> undetectable alignment monkaS
[2:16:27] <+Shonen_hero> yeah it's got a button
[2:16:28] <+DragonArt07> don't worry about it
[2:16:29] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt it will chose choices for you unless you customize and then it turns auto level off
[2:16:30] <PabstBlueFalcon> Holy shit look at that Trickery score
[2:16:31] <CruxAustralis> CHECK BIO
[2:16:33] <%Lefanque> auto level is defualt
[2:16:36] <TioXyco> @vaderxyz1970 he started the game... that counts? LUL
[2:16:38] <+MisterAvry> what class is she?
[2:16:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> We thought you were talking about healing.
[2:16:45] <%TheFabledAble> then its not on
[2:16:48] <%redthebaron> on yours
[2:16:51] <DSD24> She's a Shaman
[2:16:52] <+kingdinkyI> stop worry about it for now
[2:16:54] <$yeknomlive> shes a shaman
[2:16:54] <MemAlephh> check alignment LUL
[2:16:54] <%laserbeaming> @MisterAvry Shaman Spirit hunter
[2:16:56] <$mattynezz> It's fine, that's a problem for future Pat
[2:16:57] <+Raspada_Ryner> You can always respec
[2:16:58] <$zyberion626> IT'S FINE.
[2:17:00] <CruxAustralis> when she levels up
[2:17:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> You'll see when she levels.
[2:17:05] <CruxAustralis> it'll be a button
[2:17:06] <YuriSix_> you cant
[2:17:06] <+GimmMeASammich> Dont worry about it now. Problem for later @PatStaresAt
[2:17:07] <CruxAustralis> don't worry
[2:17:11] <quantras6> @patstaresat don't worry about it
[2:17:11] <%Questiy> hmm
[2:17:12] <CruxAustralis> it'll be very obvious
[2:17:12] <$mattynezz> Check her equipment
[2:17:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @zyberion626 yeah, she's the biggest loser of the night by far
[2:17:14] <%vaporousTippler> Open your heart to her, Pat.
[2:17:14] <+Redeyes_NI> You turn it on then when leveling you can still manually select stuff if you want
[2:17:15] <%alphonseisbest> you can't?
[2:17:19] <chaosbringer28> oh, oooooooo
[2:17:19] <%redthebaron> MAKE BIG
[2:17:22] <CruxAustralis> check her alignment PepeLaugh
[2:17:23] <quantras6> She's just a sweet girl
[2:17:23] <%redthebaron> turn huge
[2:17:24] <+Shonen_hero> big pat
[2:17:24] <%linSP> future pat will solve everything
[2:17:26] <%laserbeaming> her alignment is pretty obvious because of her battle quotes
[2:17:28] <+Shonen_hero> Make hueg
[2:17:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Anyone with undetectable alignment is secretly an asshole 100% of the time. This rule never fails.
[2:17:34] <notsoy> LMAO
[2:17:35] <+Rofiarf> lol
[2:17:37] <%sw_paladin> BECOME HUGE
[2:17:38] <wingedsword> Enlarge Person is silly.
[2:17:38] <+GimmMeASammich> BIG DWARF
[2:17:39] <%redthebaron> big dwarf
[2:17:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> She's morally gray though because she's hot.

[2:17:46] <CruxAustralis> that's a spell slot gone KEKW
[2:17:47] <zerointelligence000> this is pat's dream

[2:18:08] <enreimirai> MIN ROLL
[2:18:09] <penitentpendant> Just like Greg, it's Embiggening Time!
[2:18:10] <quantras6> @laserbeaming "death is the greatest surprise. I like surprising people" :)
[2:18:10] <+kawachipto> @laserbeaming yeah idk why they didn't have her read different lines till you know her
[2:18:11] <wingedsword> We had a Kaiju fight in the table top.
[2:18:13] <MemAlephh> literally why would a good or neutral character intentionally hide their alignment
[2:18:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> Peter Dinklage
[2:18:14] <%alphonseisbest> * MEANT bigger
[2:18:14] <%laserbeaming> rolled minimum healing lol
[2:18:15] <+vaderxyz1970> A Dwarf around Little People
[2:18:15] <enreimirai> wow you got min twice
[2:18:17] <%alphonseisbest> BIGGER
[2:18:18] <akitanito> oh no the cursed tall pat
[2:18:20] <TioXyco> enlargement, or like some say, "compensating"
[2:18:21] <%vaporousTippler> Camellia seems to be the queen of minimum possible rolls.
[2:18:21] <joodatious> enlarge reduce is always so fun
[2:18:23] <CruxAustralis> and she's out of spells PepeLaugh
[2:18:24] <%alphonseisbest> not that other word
[2:18:29] <notsoy> did you check the body?
[2:18:30] <%redthebaron> 2 is like a fifth of your hp
[2:18:34] <masheshardest> loot guy
[2:18:36] <Madinki> So how do elves work in this word? Do they still have long as fuck lives?
[2:18:39] <akitanito> oh no pat shrunk
[2:18:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> rolling for heals can be brutal
[2:18:41] <enreimirai> I found she crit every god damn attack in melee
[2:18:45] <%cooldude69xx> @vaporousTippler There's always one
[2:18:46] <$mattynezz> Pat, check new girls equipment real quick
[2:18:46] <%linSP> did you see pat shrink
[2:19:00] <%linSP> LEARN FASTER
[2:19:01] <%alphonseisbest> yea COMBAT \O/
[2:19:04] <%cooldude69xx> @Madinki Yes
[2:19:11] <CruxAustralis> you are in turn based this doesn't matter lmao
[2:19:12] <DSD24> @Madinki Yes the live long
[2:19:14] <scrumbotime> Think of this like KOTORs combat
[2:19:15] <%alphonseisbest> Feast IN THE BLOOD OF UR FOES PAT
[2:19:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> that didn't seem that paused
[2:19:20] <ToneBacas> action points it is then
[2:19:21] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt that is for real tiem
[2:19:25] <CruxAustralis> you are in turn based
[2:19:26] <%laserbeaming> you're in turn based mode, so none of that matters
[2:19:31] <%alphonseisbest> UR IN TURN BASED
[2:19:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> You're in turn-based though.
[2:19:43] <Madinki> @Madinki I see some things just never change
[2:19:43] <%athuramn> oh this ui is really intuitive
[2:19:45] <%vaporousTippler> This should be a good time.
[2:19:46] <%laserbeaming> Centipedes are not Evil
[2:19:53] <scrumbotime> also Smite Evil needs them to be Evil, not Bugs
[2:19:54] <+Speed1ines> Smite Evil is swift
[2:19:56] <%redthebaron> neutral
[2:19:57] <quantras6> @reallybigrocks if it was rtwp it would automatically pause but because it's turn based it didn't
[2:19:58] <notsoy> most animals aren't evil
[2:19:58] <%Ghufufin> turn based chad
[2:20:00] <+fetrigon> BASED
[2:20:00] <+ratchetex> idk if a bug counts as evil
[2:20:01] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt press Y
[2:20:01] <+vaderxyz1970> Are spells per battle or per rest?
[2:20:03] <akitanito> centipedes are neutral
[2:20:04] <%laserbeaming> Press inspect, you can see their alignment
[2:20:05] <%Piemono> They're just bugs
[2:20:05] <scrumbotime> You Smite EVIL not Smite Animal
[2:20:07] <%sandrews> it's just nature my dude
[2:20:08] <enreimirai> centipedes are mindless, so no alignment
[2:20:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> They're just bugs pat.
[2:20:09] <MrChaosDoughnut> They're just huge bugs.
[2:20:11] <%Cerabret100> i mean animals even bugs don't have alighnments
[2:20:12] <joodatious> turn based> RTwP
[2:20:12] <CruxAustralis> press Y to activate Inspect
[2:20:13] <$zyberion626> they're not sapient
[2:20:13] <%chance_h> Time to get poisoned
[2:20:14] <mikeriffic> Birds are evil
[2:20:14] <%Gogogolem> You have to be smart to be evil
[2:20:15] <quantras6> Animals tend to be a neutral alignment
[2:20:15] <+MisterAvry> animals are just animals
[2:20:16] <%cooldude69xx> Seagulls are evil
[2:20:16] <+Shonen_hero> squish
[2:20:17] <%pokefan9956> @PatStaresAt what about seagulls?
[2:20:18] <tanarath> Random animals arent evil

[2:20:26] <+Shonen_hero> press space to end turn
[2:20:26] <CruxAustralis> space to end her turn
[2:20:26] <%SwdVengeance> Seagulls are confirmed Evil
[2:20:28] <%laserbeaming> you can attack and move once per turn
[2:20:28] <tanarath> Outsiders etc can be
[2:20:29] <+ratchetex> it's just a bug pat, it's nit like it has malice or anything
[2:20:30] <%vaporousTippler> You have made your standard action. Make a move (not recommended) or end your turn.

[2:20:30] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt press Y pat
[2:20:30] <Scrub_Seeker> you can press Y to inspect enemies and check

[2:20:34] <$lotharrio> SPACE
[2:20:35] <chaosbringer28> no more attacks on her
[2:20:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> Evil shit is stuff like demons and skelly boys and disenfranchised youths.
[2:20:36] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Press space to end turn
[2:20:36] <$zyberion626> hit space or the hourglass button

[2:20:41] <YuriSix_> SPACE
[2:20:42] <CappuccinoGuil> She got her attack in
[2:20:42] <%Kyma1020> animals don't have a moral system like us humanoids
[2:20:42] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight Again, the entire point you're trying to make is about RNGs in RPGs. Fact of the matter is all RPGs are RNG. I don't get what you don't understand here.
[2:20:45] <+MisterAvry> immune to mind effecting, wow
[2:20:54] <+Aullama> Big boy time
[2:20:56] <%TheFabledAble> thats a good one
[2:20:56] <joodatious> I wish Owlcat worked harder on level design holy shit
[2:20:58] <+vaderxyz1970> GEESE ARE EVIL
[2:21:00] <+DerivedKnight> You get Judgements once a day.
[2:21:01] <%TheFabledAble> per rest
[2:21:01] <+Rofiarf> per rest
[2:21:01] <%Piemono> All of them are per rest
[2:21:02] <BlackStarAura> Gief wants to fuck up that centapede
[2:21:02] <CruxAustralis> all of them
[2:21:03] <%laserbeaming> All of those with a number are per day
[2:21:03] <ToneBacas> thanks Gief
[2:21:04] <joodatious> literally just a room for your first fight
[2:21:04] <@QueequegTheater> B O R K
[2:21:05] <$mattynezz> They're all per-day
[2:21:05] <AzureGale> BORK
[2:21:06] <%chiazam> Just hit it
[2:21:06] <+Rofiarf> i think
[2:21:07] <%TheFabledAble> theyre all per rest
[2:21:08] <AngryAsian5> BORK
[2:21:09] <+kawachipto> all are per rest
[2:21:09] <YuriSix_> ALL OF THEM
[2:21:09] <%vaporousTippler> Anything with a number is per rest.
[2:21:10] <%redthebaron> per rest
[2:21:12] <+Shonen_hero> you get two spells you can cast per day yeh
[2:21:12] <+Rofiarf> oh
[2:21:13] <akitanito> gief wants to judge evil
[2:21:15] <+luketrapwalker> EXACTLY GIEF
[2:21:15] <ToneBacas> one bork means yes
[2:21:18] <$mattynezz> Anything with a number is per-day
[2:21:18] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt pretty much everything in this game is per rest
[2:21:18] <%redthebaron> you can rest whenever
[2:21:20] <pitsuji> he HATES bless
[2:21:21] <+GimmMeASammich> Number in top right of icon shows how many uses you have
[2:21:21] <enreimirai> judgement is 1 per day, but last the entire fight. Spell last for duration, usually rounds/lvl or minutes/lvl
[2:21:23] <+MisterAvry> hit it with your sharp thing
[2:21:24] <+DerivedKnight> Yeah, it's all Per-Rest stuff
[2:21:27] <masheshardest> you still have cantrips though
[2:21:29] <MrChaosDoughnut> Except level 0 spells.
[2:21:31] <dybia> You have cantrips
[2:21:31] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight no there not dude, not all rpgs have RNG EVERYWHERE in every choice
[2:21:31] <%IamGrapes> good choice Pat
[2:21:32] <%YakumoYomi> Gief HATES missed attacks
[2:21:36] <%Kyma1020> you can rest whenever
[2:21:37] <%IamGrapes> MISS
[2:21:38] <scrumbotime> the WORST miss
[2:21:40] <joodatious> feedback aint great
[2:21:41] <%baka_sugoi> nice
[2:21:41] <%IamGrapes> WHIFF
[2:21:44] <akitanito> how did that thing explode then?
[2:21:44] <@Spydurman> they're all per play session, if you wanna use em again you gotta reboot the game Kappa
[2:21:46] <+JJJKopf> nat 1 LUL
[2:21:46] <%laserbeaming> lol, rolled a 1
[2:21:48] <AzureGale> Critical Miss, the evil counterpart to Critical Role
[2:21:49] <%MidnightBurst12> hell yeah
[2:21:54] <+MrTurtleThief> DansGame
[2:21:55] <+Speed1ines> @PatStaresAt They are per rest and you can mostly rest whereever
[2:21:55] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Zangief is Lex Luthor's favorite part of the stream
[2:21:56] <akitanito> totally not evil
[2:21:57] <+MisterAvry> splorch
[2:21:57] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Gief hates how crunchy this game is
[2:22:00] <AzureGale> Dude, she fucking EXPLODED it
[2:22:01] <%linSP> mmmm bug juice
[2:22:03] <$zyberion626> @akitanito the npc got it
[2:22:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> @akitanito Archer hit it
[2:22:10] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight All RPGs have RNG EVERYWHERE. Reasons they are RPGs. Only ones that don't are games that slap RPG elements on something that literally mean nothing. Like Looter Shooters.
[2:22:14] <MrChaosDoughnut> Juicy centipedes, jeez.
[2:22:16] <+MisterAvry> ooh, bodies
[2:22:24] <illtima> PATted armor
[2:22:26] <+kawachipto> death animations are solid in this game
[2:22:29] <akitanito> oh
[2:22:32] <%jtdobyns> there is a man behind you
[2:22:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> weight system seems pretty generous
[2:22:41] <+MisterAvry> this girl is cute and seems like trouble, I like her
[2:22:49] <%laserbeaming> You probably want to get a Breastplate
[2:22:52] <+Shonen_hero> I recommend not picking up most basic armor and weapons. It's mostly trash loot
[2:22:54] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight yea im counting those and things like MMOrpgs cuz im on about ALL rpgs not just Crpgs
[2:22:54] <akitanito> inspect him
[2:22:54] <$mattynezz> Armor is SUPER heavy, don't take it with you if it's not strong enough to use
[2:22:56] <%laserbeaming> at some point
[2:23:06] <+DerivedKnight> Yeah, the Weight system goes off total party, and then you have personal weight for the gear you put on.
[2:23:08] <DSD24> Crits in this game feel super good
[2:23:14] <%SpoonheadInExile> Thet's no' a Noyf
[2:23:16] <+DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt hold shift to see what you can click
[2:23:25] <DSD24> You hit a enemy and they can go flying
[2:23:27] <$zyberion626> @PatStaresAt if you hold tab it'll highlight everything that can be interacted with
[2:23:35] <$mattynezz> It's Tab
[2:23:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> He meant TAB
[2:23:40] <%alphonseisbest> why is ur foot even on the keyboard?
[2:23:44] <%athuramn> her neck looks wonky
[2:23:45] <+DragonArt07> meant tab
[2:23:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's almost always tab in these games.
[2:23:56] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight So what you're trying to say is you aren't counting RPGs, just things with RPG elements.
[2:24:00] <%logoth_> what about the gamer cube
[2:24:01] <%Agami23> why not the cube?
[2:24:08] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Pat has wee legs is how his leg is on the keyboard
[2:24:11] <+Aullama> Just press the keys with your toes. Easy
[2:24:16] <%Keeble24> im assuming Diviniry is still the better DD rpg?
[2:24:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> an arduous task
[2:24:22] <+DerivedKnight> And counting MMOs, you have RNG everytime you swing to see if you miss, hit, glance, or crit.
[2:24:23] <chaosbringer28> he has abandoned the cube
[2:24:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> monumental
[2:24:25] <%Keeble24> Divinity*
[2:24:26] <%logoth_> RIP Gamer Cube
[2:24:33] <+MisterAvry> help meee
[2:24:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> he flap
[2:24:42] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> thats a bug
[2:24:43] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight what do u think F:nw is? or wow/14 are they not rpgs to u, in the wider sense?
[2:24:44] <+MisterAvry> It's Jeff Goldblum everybody!
[2:24:45] <%chance_h> Reject cube. Embrace sphere
[2:24:48] <%laserbeaming> they have no mind to control
[2:24:49] <+Shonen_hero> they can't be prone because they can fly
[2:24:50] <scrumbotime> you can't mind control a bug, they don't have a mind complex enough to control
[2:24:50] <akitanito> I can't believe that wasn't a trap
[2:24:52] <%cooldude69xx> Is too dumb
[2:24:53] <+kawachipto> @keeble24 this is much closer to table top
[2:24:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> no thoughts, head empty
[2:24:58] <DSD24> Is that a Cazador
[2:25:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> I'm sure pat already figured this out, but I hope he doesn't miss any scales.
[2:25:07] <Reanimator83> You will be missed Gamer Cube BibleThump
[2:25:09] <BlackStarAura> BEES
[2:25:20] <%chiazam> Crossbow
[2:25:25] <%Keeble24> @kawachipto ahhh i see
[2:25:28] <dreadedcthulhu> there's too many commas in that sentence
[2:25:31] <%AyotoCorp> Top of the screen
[2:25:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> weird commas
[2:25:33] <%redthebaron> up there
[2:25:33] <dreadedcthulhu> sloppy structuring
[2:25:33] <%Gogogolem> the queue is up top
[2:25:35] <%redthebaron> look
[2:25:35] <%chance_h> @reallybigrocks is that a Toulouse meme reference?!
[2:25:37] <%Gogogolem> hover over it
[2:25:40] <%vaporousTippler> That's a bad sentence. Delay on the character's turn with the button. It'll be clear.
[2:25:40] <akitanito> so you can alpha strike if needed
[2:25:41] <+Shonen_hero> take their turn at a later time
[2:25:43] <%laserbeaming> that's to delay a turn, you won't use it often
[2:25:45] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt click the fucking button on top of the screen
[2:25:46] <scrumbotime> you click the DELAY button
[2:25:48] <chaosbringer28> delay
[2:25:48] <%Ghufufin> delay lets you take your turn later
[2:25:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hit the delay button.
[2:25:49] <+JJJKopf> hit the big delay button
[2:25:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dumbass.
[2:25:50] <$mattynezz> Pat, there's a next page button
[2:25:51] <tanarath> read again
[2:25:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> I always thought it was weird that rats and stuff could get that Vermin immunity even though they have the smart mammal brain.
[2:25:56] <%Gogogolem> Click then click delay below it
[2:25:57] <%Piemono> Hit delay if you want them to delay their turn
[2:25:58] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt theres a big delay button, if you dont want that person to go yet, cause your setting up a combo or something. you can move em back in the order
[2:25:58] <%GarbageNirvana> They just hold their turn
[2:26:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> more pages
[2:26:06] <chaosbringer28> click the person, then click delay
[2:26:06] <+kawachipto> @keeble24 I like this game more, but I bet most would like divinity
[2:26:06] <akitanito> it's too verbose
[2:26:10] <chaosbringer28> to delay the turn
[2:26:11] <%chiazam> Just select it
[2:26:12] <ToneBacas> yeah that phrase is bork
[2:26:12] <$mattynezz> PAGES
[2:26:13] <%Gogogolem> click on them
[2:26:15] <%vaporousTippler> Yeah, it's an actual wrong sentence.
[2:26:17] <joodatious> the writing sucks
[2:26:19] <%YakumoYomi> Next page, perhaps?
[2:26:19] <%Gogogolem> then click the delay button
[2:26:19] <+Shonen_hero> So they mean select the character on their turn
[2:26:19] <$mattynezz> THREE PAGES
[2:26:22] <%laserbeaming> Text is bad, yes
[2:26:32] <+emperri> become art vandelay
[2:26:33] <%HolePunchLeaf> yeah this needed another pass
[2:26:34] <$zyberion626> The devs are Russian
[2:26:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Devs are based in Russia, right? Who do they have translating this?
[2:26:45] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight Yeah, I mentioned MMOs. What about them? MMOs have RNG all the time, but don't have inclusions to worry about things involving skill checks against NPCs.
[2:26:47] <%alphonseisbest> yea Text is bad here and in Kingmaker, they need to work on that
[2:26:50] <%vaporousTippler> Disregard the tutorial. You can trust us. We are helpful, are we not?
[2:26:56] <ToneBacas> is that an escaped quotation mark? LUL
[2:27:04] <%Keeble24> too bad  i had high hopes for this game
[2:27:06] <%laserbeaming> does this explain the 5-foot step?
[2:27:21] <%vaporousTippler> Hold shift to do a 5 foot step.
[2:27:22] <+vaderxyz1970> Its just 3.5 you can wing it
[2:27:24] <%MightyDuckShoes> ,
[2:27:26] <%Ghufufin> move 5 feet or less
[2:27:27] <ScrubTheNerd> Right click
[2:27:29] <+JJJKopf> wow I can't believe a 100 hour long russian rpg isn't bug free
[2:27:32] <%laserbeaming> Press right click to switch between move and 5 feet
[2:27:33] <$mattynezz> Right Click to 5fs
[2:27:33] <joodatious> this game just makes me wanna go back to divinity
[2:27:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hit the 5 ft button
[2:27:38] <Visorak6> Shift switches
[2:27:39] <akitanito> the left box is highlighted if you're within 5ft
[2:27:40] <$zyberion626> @Keeble24 it's a solid crpg
[2:27:46] <%vaporousTippler> Because I played Kingmaker.
[2:27:48] <+HawkeInitiative> you can also right click to limit movement to certain actiosn
[2:27:49] <+kawachipto> @keeble24 this game is fantastic, just very very deep and hard. which divinity isn't
[2:27:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> @tonebacas lol looks like the string processing is fucked up
[2:27:50] <%Lefanque> how indeed
[2:27:51] <%laserbeaming> the game sucks at tutorials
[2:27:53] <%redthebaron> because you played the last one and knows
[2:27:56] <+JJJKopf> in the controls
[2:28:03] <+Shonen_hero> yeah
[2:28:04] <+Aullama> The spirits? monkaS
[2:28:06] <DSD24> That sounds Lawful Good alright
[2:28:12] <+Shonen_hero> damage at this level is just bad
[2:28:13] <akitanito> that's gross
[2:28:13] <%Keeble24> ill give it a chance then haha
[2:28:23] <+ratchetex> what
[2:28:23] <akitanito> calm down girl
[2:28:24] <stormhawk9891> Uhhhhh.....
[2:28:25] <Reanimator83> @keeble24 some of the writing is poorly written. that's it
[2:28:25] <scrumbotime> Miss. Ma'am.
[2:28:28] <%MightyDuckShoes> hmmmm
[2:28:30] <%laserbeaming> it's so obvious
[2:28:31] <scrumbotime> Madam.
[2:28:32] <notsoy> damn this bitch is EXTRA
[2:28:32] <%vaporousTippler> She's fine. Open your heart to her.
[2:28:32] <%TheFabledAble> she is super murder horny
[2:28:33] <+MisterAvry> shhhh
[2:28:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> No shut up Pat.
[2:28:35] <pitsuji> shes just excited
[2:28:35] <lethallylactic> LUL
[2:28:36] <zerointelligence000> you wanna lean into that mic girl?
[2:28:37] <joodatious> this is a wendys
[2:28:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> She's morally gray.
[2:28:38] <%Piemono> Anyone who hides their alignment is sus
[2:28:40] <AngryAsian5> SUS
[2:28:40] <+Shonen_hero> LUL
[2:28:42] <+MisterAvry> nahh it's cool
[2:28:45] <%Ghufufin> the evil just slips out
[2:28:45] <enreimirai> I know her alignment. It is exactly what you think, and she does a HILARIOUSLY bad job hiding it
[2:28:49] <%TheFabledAble> she practically jacks it everytime you murder something
[2:28:51] <+MisterAvry> don't worry about it
[2:28:53] <%baka_sugoi> mung us
[2:28:55] <+Shonen_hero> Cam can cure her
[2:28:56] <MemAlephh> camellia's alignment is the most telegraphed thing its so funny
[2:29:01] <%laserbeaming> deactivate Inspect Mode outside of combat, it'll save you headaches
[2:29:01] <+vaderxyz1970> She's just getting into it
[2:29:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> she's tanky she can take it
[2:29:07] <$mattynezz> You can rest
[2:29:08] <%chiazam> I could make her worse
[2:29:11] <+kawachipto> Her reactions are hilarious tbh
[2:29:13] <%vaporousTippler> Camellia is THAT person at the gaming table.
[2:29:16] <chaosbringer28> and you already spent all your healing
[2:29:16] <+cappyd33> blood for the blood god
[2:29:25] <$mattynezz> Charge
[2:29:29] <Berendenn> the voice acting seems not great
[2:29:39] <MemAlephh> try switching to real time just for funsies
[2:29:40] <notsoy> why are you waiting until AFTEr the monster lol
[2:29:43] <scrumbotime> pat you don't have to delay PAST enemies
[2:29:44] <zerointelligence000> I'm assuming cam is a murder hobo
[2:29:49] <$mattynezz> Charge let's you move your full amount and still attack
[2:29:49] <%MightyDuckShoes> Camelia doesn't want you to check her search history
[2:29:52] <%cooldude69xx> Guys be like "I can fix her" Her:
[2:29:57] <%vaporousTippler> If you can't reach with a single move action, use charge.
[2:29:58] <%GarbageNirvana> You know what this is, this is theater acting
[2:30:01] <%Ghufufin> move back
[2:30:01] <asurite_warrior> ewww turn based
[2:30:02] <%laserbeaming> it was too far, you couldn't have got there
[2:30:06] <masheshardest> defense
[2:30:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> would be nice if you could create companions in this game so I can re-create the cast of konosuba and eat dirt by encounter 3
[2:30:17] <+MisterAvry> ooh, this one spits
[2:30:18] <+Pendragwn> chad total defense
[2:30:20] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight look what im getting at here is that the lack of control the plkayer has over SC's in these types of games compared to things like how say an mmo does combat rng or F:NV does its skill checks is worse imo, cuz they rely on the game being a fair DM, when most AI dms play by the stright numbers, when in irl a dm might be lose with it and that lack of control sucks. and judging by chat im not alone in that feeling. sorry for the wall fot text
[2:30:21] <$zyberion626> @cooldude69xx nah, guys are like "crazy chicks are hot"
[2:30:22] <%baka_sugoi> ass
[2:30:24] <%Ghufufin> charge!
[2:30:26] <%cooldude69xx> LOOKIT IM WADDLE
[2:30:29] <+Aullama> Lidl dwarf legs danKEK
[2:30:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> short little dorf legs
[2:30:32] <MemAlephh> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ you can create companions later on
[2:30:34] <+kawachipto> @kosorsomesaykosm_ you can
[2:30:36] <DSD24> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ You can create party members
[2:30:37] <Samuy_JP> click the S above your abilities to use her cantrip spells  BTW @patstaresat
[2:30:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stubbydwarf legs
[2:30:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh, nice
[2:30:50] <+Shonen_hero> yeah charge can let you take full movement and attack
[2:30:50] <$mattynezz> You can rest anywhere, of you need to
[2:30:51] <+MisterAvry> you can loot one of them pedes
[2:30:53] <joodatious> does this game have co-op?
[2:30:56] <+Shonen_hero> but only at the start of the round
[2:30:58] <sendart> you also have ranged spell
[2:30:58] <ThatGuyThere03> Not that you should do this, but is there an option to turn off battle chatter in game?
[2:30:59] <joodatious> if not then its garbage
[2:30:59] <%alphonseisbest> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ off topic, but dope name!
[2:31:11] <+kawachipto> double click
[2:31:11] <%laserbeaming> double click, you put them on their belt
[2:31:12] <$zyberion626> it's a shared inventory
[2:31:16] <%vaporousTippler> Her model actually changes if you give her items. If you put a potion on her belt, it shows up.
[2:31:17] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:31:18] <%Lefanque> right click use
[2:31:19] <%alphonseisbest> @joodatious i don't think so no
[2:31:20] <DSD24> Yeah all weapons you carry show up on the character
[2:31:21] <%laserbeaming> there is a sort
[2:31:21] <+Shonen_hero> there is
[2:31:22] <+MisterAvry> I bet you can get even cooler shit
[2:31:22] <%Piemono> Up top man
[2:31:23] <+GimmMeASammich> Right click the potion
[2:31:26] <Flagnalok> Drop down menu is the sort
[2:31:26] <DSD24> Yes look at the purple bar
[2:31:29] <+kawachipto> sort is that purple box
[2:31:29] <$zyberion626> to use potions in battle you got to equip it to a belt
[2:31:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> I hate how all the models look.
[2:31:31] <+chestertonfencer> Clipping sword
[2:31:31] <%laserbeaming> below the icons
[2:31:32] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you can right click a potion to consume it in the menu for the character you have selected. you can sort with the tab under the icons of your inventory
[2:31:32] <$mattynezz> The people bar
[2:31:33] <%Lefanque> OR put it on belt and use out of menu
[2:31:34] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Purple bar the top
[2:31:37] <MemAlephh> purple bar top right
[2:31:37] <+Shonen_hero> that blank purble bar above your items is your sorting
[2:31:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ thanks, it gives me additional insight
[2:31:39] <%vaporousTippler> Bracers of armor won't help anyone who already has armor. It doesn't stack.
[2:31:40] <$mattynezz> Purple bar
[2:31:42] <ScrubTheNerd> The purple bar at the top is the sort
[2:31:43] <JaceDarkstar> it looks like pots are on the bottom
[2:31:45] <mikeriffic> Is that bar purple or blue tho?
[2:31:49] <%MightyDuckShoes> The difficulty settings in this game should be a selection of Three DMs, a fun one, a serious one and That Asshole.
[2:31:49] <%Gogogolem> lower
[2:31:56] <$zyberion626> the BAR
[2:31:58] <%TheDullaMAN> Put your other Bracers back on!
[2:31:59] <+kawachipto> below the icons
[2:32:01] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight Well of course you aren't alone in that. Many people have differing opinions on that. Some like it, some don't. My initial talk was against your flat out statement that these systems 'Don't work' and then you wanting to argue that RNG doesn't affect RPGs.
[2:32:02] <joodatious> normalize co-op in tabletop based CRPGS
[2:32:04] <%sw_paladin> Those are for mages
[2:32:05] <%alphonseisbest> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ coxWiggle coxWiggle coxWiggle
[2:32:06] <%Ghufufin> you can have seelah drink a healing potion
[2:32:08] <Scrub_Seeker> those bracers are for classes that can't wear armor like mages
[2:32:09] <boggycrook> Pat, put your bracers back on
[2:32:17] <%vaporousTippler> Right of the character portraits, top button.
[2:32:22] <%Ghufufin> no
[2:32:25] <+HawkeInitiative> Armour bonuses dont stack
[2:32:26] <Visorak6> Your old ones had a Luck bonus to AC
[2:32:27] <$mattynezz> No, he's wrong
[2:32:27] <%TheFabledAble> youre wrong dont
[2:32:28] <%laserbeaming> Boggycrook is wrong
[2:32:28] <%Piemono> Bracers also gives saves
[2:32:29] <masheshardest> the original ones
[2:32:30] <%TheDullaMAN> You have a different set of bracers
[2:32:32] <$zyberion626> one guy.
[2:32:32] <DSD24> Your previous ones worked though
[2:32:33] <%laserbeaming> Bracers are for Mages
[2:32:33] <$mattynezz> No Beavers
[2:32:34] <Samuy_JP> stealth is right of the character  panes
[2:32:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> That was one guy.
[2:32:37] <MemAlephh> hes lying
[2:32:39] <chaosbringer28> small circle buttons to the right of the character portraits
[2:32:40] <+DerivedKnight> Not the Bracers of Armor. The Bracers you have give you saves
[2:32:43] <YuriSix_> bracers are for nerds
[2:32:43] <CruxAustralis> same bonuses don't stack
[2:32:44] <%TheFabledAble> LKOL
[2:32:45] <DSD24> The lucky ones yes
[2:32:49] <boggycrook> @laserbeaming Yep, I'm lying whoops
[2:32:50] <%TheFabledAble> that was right tho
[2:32:52] <+HawkeInitiative> vindicated
[2:32:52] <+DerivedKnight> And Luck Bonuses will stack
[2:32:57] <DSD24> Wow
[2:33:01] <+MisterAvry> probably wanna stop glowing first
[2:33:03] <%TheFabledAble> gawd I love camellia
[2:33:03] <%chiazam> @patstaresat what about the crossbow?
[2:33:03] <joodatious> I fucking hate this character holy shit she's annoying
[2:33:04] <+Shonen_hero> and if you select all of them and press the stealth button they all stealth
[2:33:04] <scrumbotime> I love a voice line like "You can trust me"
[2:33:08] <DSD24> "You can trust me"
[2:33:08] <%TheFabledAble> murder horny elf
[2:33:10] <$mattynezz> Get Seelah to cuff some health juice
[2:33:12] <+Shonen_hero> your stealth skill
[2:33:13] <zerointelligence000> the fact that she has to say you can trust her
[2:33:13] <joodatious> "tee-hee im not evil"
[2:33:14] <%Ghufufin> stealth skill vs perception skill
[2:33:15] <%laserbeaming> A hidden check determines if it works
[2:33:15] <+Pendragwn> @DerivedKnight I think only Dodge bonuses stack
[2:33:16] <%vaporousTippler> She has no sneak attack ability.
[2:33:17] <Flagnalok> Your stealth vs their perception check
[2:33:20] <DSD24> It did pat
[2:33:21] <JaceDarkstar> they would need to be different kinds of bonuses to stack techniquly
[2:33:23] <+MisterAvry> it hurt it
[2:33:23] <joodatious> wow she's so quirky
[2:33:26] <Visorak6> Surprise round
[2:33:29] <%laserbeaming> you only get one action during a surprise round
[2:33:29] <+cappyd33> i like herr
[2:33:31] <%Ghufufin> you;re in a surprise round
[2:33:31] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt youre short, you cant run as far
[2:33:31] <+TreskM> Surprise round
[2:33:35] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight ok by don't work i mean they suck, arguing the wording pedantic, and i never said rng does affect rpgs but that not every rpg is AS heavily affected by RNG and, thats for the better
[2:33:35] <enreimirai> you in a surprise round, everyone gets a half-action
[2:33:35] <$mattynezz> Surprise round
[2:33:36] <chaosbringer28> surprise round it worked
[2:33:37] <MemAlephh> surprise round
[2:33:38] <+Shonen_hero> you got surprise on them, which means you can only attack or move
[2:33:38] <+DeadPhoenix3> you got a surprise round
[2:33:45] <+kawachipto> She is clearly lawful good Kappa
[2:33:46] <chaosbringer28> dont get move actions in surprise round
[2:33:46] <CruxAustralis> splat
[2:33:47] <+DerivedKnight> @DerivedKnight They do stack with themselves. I meant more so his Luck Bonus armor would stack with his current armor.
[2:33:48] <+MisterAvry> oh damn
[2:33:49] <%vaporousTippler> Hit T twice during a surprise round to get a full turn. It's a glitch.
[2:33:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> MORALLY.
[2:33:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> GRAY.
[2:33:51] <masheshardest> don't forget about your 0 level spells
[2:33:53] <mikeriffic> She is Lawful good I bet
[2:33:55] <sendart> that bitch has no chill
[2:33:57] <+Shonen_hero> I love Cam's barks
[2:34:02] <tanarath> Surprise round = free action
[2:34:02] <enreimirai> btw, if you charge, you can do double your move then attack, but it has to be a strait line with nothing in the way
[2:34:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> jeez lady
[2:34:06] <+Pendragwn> @vaporousTippler is it really
[2:34:07] <MemAlephh> shes so good
[2:34:09] <+Shonen_hero> they are the most obviously evil shit in the world
[2:34:11] <joodatious> cam is awful
[2:34:12] <+Pendragwn> @vaporousTippler or is this a joke
[2:34:14] <+vaderxyz1970> There are a lot of Giblets going around
[2:34:16] <joodatious> who wrote this trash
[2:34:17] <%laserbeaming> she loves murder
[2:34:24] <Samuy_JP> remember the S above your movement is your 0 level spells
[2:34:24] <%vaporousTippler> Yes, it's a documented bug from Kingmaker. It just happens more in this one.
[2:34:28] <%jtdobyns> THE SPIRITS DEMAND YOUR BLOOD!  totally Good right?
[2:34:29] <+MisterAvry> big lizard!
[2:34:31] <%baka_sugoi> eat it
[2:34:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> STINKY LIZER
[2:34:32] <akitanito> that's a normal sized one
[2:34:33] <%cooldude69xx> Those are different pat
[2:34:35] <zerointelligence000> it's a real life dragon
[2:34:42] <%alphonseisbest> YO SICK
[2:34:54] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt don't be afraid to use your pots
[2:35:01] <+JJJKopf> the auto formation is for real time
[2:35:04] <Visorak6> This is pretty 1:1 with tabletop
[2:35:07] <%cooldude69xx> @jtdobyns Morally. Gray
[2:35:16] <$mattynezz> LUL
[2:35:18] <%YakumoYomi> F
[2:35:18] <zzNamttamzz> F
[2:35:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Well done Pat.
[2:35:20] <%vaporousTippler> Actually. Strike that, I'm wrong. The bug is you can clear it at all. Surprise rounds only have one action.
[2:35:20] <Visorak6> She's okay she's not dead
[2:35:22] <scrumbotime> Don't worry she's still breathing
[2:35:24] <%laserbeaming> you've been having bad luck man
[2:35:24] <%alphonseisbest> WOW
[2:35:24] <+MisterAvry> F
[2:35:24] <$zyberion626> she's fine
[2:35:27] <+kawachipto> She's ok
[2:35:27] <zerointelligence000> she was at critical
[2:35:27] <%alphonseisbest> rip
[2:35:34] <$zyberion626> you can heal her back up @PatStaresAt
[2:35:40] <DSD24> That's some good damage
[2:35:41] <CruxAustralis> you gotta use your pots my dude
[2:35:48] <%laserbeaming> not dead
[2:35:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> get em in the HDMI port
[2:35:52] <+MisterAvry> SCP 682 has breached containment
[2:35:53] <DSD24> Oh no a 1
[2:35:54] <$zyberion626> no
[2:35:56] <+Shonen_hero> she's fine
[2:36:01] <%Ghufufin> 5 ft  step into flanking
[2:36:03] <Berendenn> dice rooools
[2:36:11] <masheshardest> this might be the time to learn about flanking
[2:36:12] <%Piemono> The True DND experience
[2:36:14] <%laserbeaming> she's knocked out. She only dies if she goes too far into negative health
[2:36:16] <%sw_paladin> Knocked out
[2:36:16] <notsoy> start using those heals
[2:36:20] <joodatious> when are these types of games gonna allow actual level design for combat?
[2:36:22] <+Shonen_hero> so your level 1 so your health pool is smol
[2:36:23] <%vaporousTippler> You don't have to positionally flank. If two characters engage something, it's flanked in Pathfinder.
[2:36:25] <$mattynezz> F5 to quick save
[2:36:25] <Visorak6> You should probably have your caster use CLW on you guys
[2:36:26] <scrumbotime> Hey, if a monitor lizard ran the fuck up on me like that I DEFINITELY would die
[2:36:30] <%sandrews> could the fact that it's the sword?
[2:36:31] <MemAlephh> what difficulty is he playing on LUL
[2:36:35] <+DerivedKnight> Use them potions my Guy
[2:36:37] <+JJJKopf> press Y again so it doesn't highlight eveytime
[2:36:38] <mikeriffic> A wolf almost 1v1ed my entire party once in a low level campaign
[2:36:41] <CruxAustralis> oof min roll
[2:36:41] <$zyberion626> Welcome to Pathfinder.
[2:36:42] <+MisterAvry> bad rolls awww
[2:36:42] <+Shonen_hero> good news is that was the toughest enemy for the time being
[2:36:44] <$mattynezz> You can rest
[2:36:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> harsh
[2:36:49] <mikeriffic> To be fair it was a very large wolf
[2:36:51] <chaosbringer28> random healing amount
[2:36:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> You should've buffed lol.
[2:36:55] <%cooldude69xx> Wow, thats a real good example of low level combat
[2:36:57] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt remember never use the scales they are important later
[2:36:57] <%alphonseisbest> rest?
[2:36:58] <%sw_paladin> Can you rest?
[2:36:59] <$mattynezz> Oh, lol
[2:37:00] <%MugenSandan> We're gonna need an RNGesus emote
[2:37:03] <$zyberion626> @PatStaresAt does ability penalites are because of her fatigue not because she got knocked out
[2:37:04] <+Shonen_hero> you can, just not here
[2:37:06] <Visorak6> Does Camellia still have her heal spells?
[2:37:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> is short rest a different button?
[2:37:09] <%alphonseisbest> f
[2:37:16] <%snow_bush> What Class and build?
[2:37:21] <$zyberion626> Those
[2:37:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[2:37:22] <lethallylactic> ??
[2:37:23] <%vaporousTippler> We found the tutorial writer.
[2:37:24] <$zyberion626> sorry
[2:37:27] <%greasypete00> LUL
[2:37:28] <+Shonen_hero> zyber what
[2:37:30] <%Agami23> i think they mean "those"
[2:37:31] <%cooldude69xx> @snow_bush dwarf
[2:37:33] <chaosbringer28> lel
[2:37:34] <+MisterAvry> does is are more done do like?
[2:37:34] <ThatGuyThere03> *those
[2:37:34] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt you can hover over her status to see what's affecting her
[2:37:36] <+HawkeInitiative> @ReallyBigRocks no short rest in pathfinder, thats a 5e thing
[2:37:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> Those
[2:37:37] <%laserbeaming> @zyberion626 fatigue is -2 STR and DEX if that's what you mean
[2:37:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> those Pat
[2:37:38] <notsoy> try spelling right, bro
[2:37:39] <$zyberion626> THOSE ABILITY PENALITES
[2:37:40] <lethallylactic> Does = Those?
[2:37:42] <+Raspada_Ryner> Her fatigue was becasue of the failed skill check earlier
[2:37:42] <+kawachipto> We found the writer guys LUL
[2:37:43] <%Monkeyweed21> deez nuts lmao
[2:37:43] <MemAlephh> yes
[2:37:44] <+GimmMeASammich> those*
[2:37:44] <%PhysicsLB> My best advice for PF2E is "DON'T lower your shield."
[2:37:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> not does
[2:37:44] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> @vaporousTippler Fucking Lol
[2:37:45] <ExpressNode> Deez
[2:37:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Those ability penalties she has.
[2:37:49] <%TheWinged7> me too english good
[2:37:53] <+Shonen_hero> She's got penalties to her stats because she got fatigued healping Anevia. You fucked up so she got tired
[2:37:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> I don't know why he felt the need to mention them.
[2:37:56] <LoudmicRPG> Obviously misspelled, dont be pedantic
[2:37:57] <%Ghufufin> he means she has the fatigued condition because of the earlier failed skill check and not because she was knocked unconscious
[2:38:13] <DSD24> Aww yeah its Wenduag!
[2:38:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> woah he's outside
[2:38:20] <%Cerabret100> this dude has some shit going on...also spider lady?
[2:38:21] <chaosbringer28> tiefling?
[2:38:24] <enreimirai> You should probably kill windog, just in case
[2:38:24] <CruxAustralis> Wenduag <3
[2:38:25] <%Agami23> is that a spider lady? hot?
[2:38:26] <MemAlephh> charactes get fatigued from some events or for going too long without resting
[2:38:27] <%thebeargoesHONK> thebeargoesHONK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Hey Pat, i am looking to reinvest all of my savings.  Do you think i should invest into cypto or NFT's?
[2:38:27] <+Shonen_hero> Oh yeah the weirdest
[2:38:30] <%TheWinged7> dragon, tefiling?
[2:38:30] <$zyberion626> spider cat lady
[2:38:30] <DSD24> Spider Cat lady
[2:38:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> You should probably kill these things.
[2:38:36] <%laserbeaming> Lann is best boy
[2:38:45] <+kawachipto> this guy was drunk recording his lines LUL
[2:38:45] <zzNamttamzz> ATTACK
[2:38:54] <DSD24> Wendy is the best
[2:38:54] <%TheWinged7> i like spoder cat lady
[2:38:55] <$yeknomlive> she sounds like she always hated chocolate
[2:38:58] <joodatious> I kinda wish this had no voice acting its really not well written
[2:38:58] <+DerivedKnight> I like Wendaug.
[2:38:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Why's it always gotta be mazes
[2:39:02] <MemAlephh> his voice acting is the worst
[2:39:03] <CruxAustralis> Lann is such a judgemental asshole lmao
[2:39:04] <enreimirai> Lann is one of the most powerful companions in the game
[2:39:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> measurehead?
[2:39:22] <zerointelligence000> straight up racism
[2:39:25] <CruxAustralis> Lann is REALLY  strong
[2:39:32] <+cappyd33> cool
[2:39:34] <%vaporousTippler> Lann has a fucking magnum.
[2:39:34] <+Shonen_hero> nah they just are children of crusaders that got fucked up due to demon energy
[2:39:37] <+vaderxyz1970> So I take that as a Yes
[2:39:38] <+Shonen_hero> kinda like radiation
[2:39:40] <gyde42> Morlocks?
[2:39:43] <+DeadPhoenix3> i bet, zen archer is really good iirc
[2:39:43] <Funkyguy321> literal zasshus
[2:39:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> It's that a Carth I hear?
[2:39:47] <%Ghufufin> morlocks
[2:39:50] <sirrice77> @ReallyBigRocks dude i would love a game that has a measurehead like companion, it'll never happen but i wish it would
[2:39:52] <%RealThiele> Mattgrels
[2:39:52] <%Buzzard42> What happened to "wait two years before playing a WRPG"
[2:39:52] <%sw_paladin> Mutants?
[2:39:53] <MrChaosDoughnut> Mongrelfolk?
[2:39:59] <%alphonseisbest> uplanders! LUL
[2:40:10] <%sandrews> futurama mutanats? Got it!
[2:40:12] <$yeknomlive> uplander doom
[2:40:22] <+Shonen_hero> Golarion is the planet your on
[2:40:24] <%sandrews> mutants*
[2:40:28] <%cooldude69xx> @ReallyBigRocks It'd be great. He'd be wrong the whole time and you could change his mind
[2:40:41] <%TheWinged7> now i want to play a spider-cat lady
[2:41:04] <tanarath> Haaaaaa
[2:41:09] <DSD24> You can get the Spider lady as a party member
[2:41:10] <%chiazam> He’s delusional
[2:41:12] <%RealThiele> ignore the claws and drool
[2:41:13] <enreimirai> Lann not only is zen archer, one of the absolute best ranged archetypes... he uses unchained monk, which is way more powerful and isn't technically legal to use with zen archer >_>. So hes an OP character that is cheating =D
[2:41:27] <CruxAustralis> remember that we once lived :)
[2:41:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hyper edgelord and the clown at the table
[2:41:37] <$mattynezz> His stats are also jacked high
[2:41:43] <%laserbeaming> he's super OP and you'll need him because the game is hard
[2:41:51] <+Pendragwn> some sort of stardust crusaders
[2:41:52] <+kawachipto> @enreimirai too bad he is boring. but yeah he is broken
[2:41:54] <%vaporousTippler> Lann is played by the DM's significant other, and breaks all the rules.
[2:41:55] <+Pendragwn> KILL THEM :)
[2:41:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> A holy sword you say?
[2:41:59] <Scrub_Seeker> you dont HAVE to talk to them about everything, you just have to ask them what they're doing
[2:42:02] <%laserbeaming> he's probably the strongest character in the game
[2:42:05] <%Order_of_Mystery> just got back and theres some cute demihumans
[2:42:09] <tanarath> Unchained is a great skillset for melee characters, though.
[2:42:13] <%RealThiele> EXCALIBURRRRR
[2:42:15] <%ComfortableStranger> that's how it is in the US midwest, long conversation or violence
[2:42:37] <MemAlephh> i didnt take lann because i found him annoying and im doing fine on Daring
[2:42:44] <enreimirai> This game is actually hilariously easier than kingmaker. Because it has way better balanced encounters and dont have nonsense like a lvl 5 wizard with 4th lvl spells and min-maxed rogues in a lvl 1 zone
[2:42:55] <+Shonen_hero> Heaven's a place, but it's fantasy not Jesus heaven
[2:43:04] <enreimirai> still not easy, mind, but kingmaker was a mess of balance
[2:43:04] <%chiazam> Heaven
[2:43:28] <%vaporousTippler> This heaven has like, a few hundred Jesuses.
[2:43:32] <+HawkeInitiative> Which god is he following? Torag?
[2:43:43] <CruxAustralis> wait until Pat learns about the three different heavens
[2:43:44] <CruxAustralis> PepeLaugh
[2:43:45] <+Shonen_hero> Gorum
[2:43:46] <%cooldude69xx> @vaporousTippler And they all know kung fu
[2:43:46] <+DerivedKnight> Gorum
[2:43:47] <%laserbeaming> probably Iomedae
[2:43:48] <+Shonen_hero> god of war
[2:43:49] <+Jack8274> Would that be Jesi?
[2:43:52] <+HawkeInitiative> Ahhh
[2:43:53] <CruxAustralis> and the three kinds of demons
[2:44:01] <+kawachipto> balance curve is much better here than kingmaker
[2:44:02] <CruxAustralis> Devil Demon and Daemon lmao
[2:44:03] <%vaporousTippler> A herd of Jesii.
[2:44:07] <+DerivedKnight> He's an Inquisitor of our God in Iron! Praised be the blood we spill in combat in his name!
[2:44:09] <%laserbeaming> Ah Pat? Yeah, he's a Gorum boy
[2:44:13] <+Shonen_hero> demons, devils and daemons
[2:44:18] <%RealThiele> Cacaodaemon familiar tho :D
[2:44:23] <+Shonen_hero> they all hate each other
[2:44:24] <CruxAustralis> @kawachipto except for the optional bosses
[2:44:27] <%chiazam> “Rash actions” stands for rebelling against the surface
[2:44:29] <CruxAustralis> don't fuck with water elementals lmao
[2:44:29] <joodatious> this game needs to pace out its sentences
[2:44:47] <joodatious> have one to two lines and click not paragraphs at a time
[2:44:55] <+vaderxyz1970> @Shonen_hero Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive and Dodge
[2:44:57] <%alphonseisbest> @DerivedKnight Khorne?! LUL
[2:44:58] <akitanito> hurts the VA's line reads too
[2:45:00] <+Shonen_hero> basically the devils all work on the law, neutral and chaos axioms. One race is almost entirely lawful evil, entirely neutral evil or entirely chaotic evil
[2:45:03] <+kawachipto> @cruxaustralis that's why they are optional
[2:45:09] <%redthebaron> gongs
[2:45:12] <CruxAustralis> true lmao
[2:45:18] <CruxAustralis> also there are some non optional rooms that suck
[2:45:22] <%cooldude69xx> @Shonen_hero And dragons and drive-ins
[2:45:25] <CruxAustralis> the two minotaurs one in the Keep comes to mind
[2:45:26] <+Pendragwn> tf is a gong
[2:45:27] <%RealThiele> gong rips for jesus
[2:45:27] <CruxAustralis> that room is MEAN
[2:45:31] <+Jack8274> Ok where is Merlin hiding?
[2:45:37] <+HawkeInitiative> reminds me of that britbong greentext
[2:45:38] <CruxAustralis> I once got critted for 71 damage it was nice
[2:45:41] <$yeknomlive> gong gong never die
[2:45:42] <MemAlephh> im excited for the water elemental
[2:46:09] <DSD24> Sword is very Swordy
[2:46:13] <CruxAustralis> I hope Pat gets to the Vrock PepeLaugh
[2:46:13] <%CopperTucker> I love this terrible voice acting
[2:46:15] <+Shonen_hero> she was listening
[2:46:17] <+Shonen_hero> also head wood
[2:46:17] <+Pendragwn> @CruxAustralis should have played around it
[2:46:19] <+Bluemanzee> Sword-a like a sword
[2:46:26] <CruxAustralis> man Wenduag is so cute
[2:46:27] <%RealThiele> monee
[2:46:28] <+kawachipto> @cruxaustralis there are mages in dresden that have a 140 damage attack
[2:46:30] <@Ranryu692> which one of them are Leela's parents?
[2:46:30] <%logoth_> swo-hard
[2:46:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Did Joss Whedon write this or something
[2:46:37] <MemAlephh> she was lightheaded from almost dying
[2:46:39] <+vaderxyz1970> Serious question do Pathfinder angels go back to heaven when they die?
[2:46:39] <%alphonseisbest> ... I hate Lann already
[2:46:40] <%cooldude69xx> @CruxAustralis Should have read the mix bro
[2:46:40] <CruxAustralis> @kawachipto lmao nice
[2:46:41] <%laserbeaming> not yet
[2:46:50] <%RealThiele> thats what she said
[2:46:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> You're just some asshole.
[2:47:07] <+kawachipto> @cruxaustralis that was some bs. and this is middle of act 2 LUL
[2:47:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> @vaderxyz1970 I think that depends on various things.
[2:47:09] <+Shonen_hero> none of those have weight by the way. All the crafting stuff has no weight
[2:47:15] <MemAlephh> the rogue character in this game is basically doing the same bit as lann but is a million times more charming
[2:47:17] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt you can read on bottom right
[2:47:23] <%cooldude69xx> @vaderxyz1970 Unless they were already in heaven, then they die permanently
[2:47:32] <akitanito> all for selling
[2:47:38] <tanarath> @vaderxyz1970 their soul returns to become a part of their home plane, aka, they kinda cease to exist
[2:47:44] <%Gogogolem> everycharacter does it
[2:47:45] <CruxAustralis> @kawachipto there are some mean demons too
[2:47:45] <%Afterman_> mouse over the checks for info
[2:47:47] <CruxAustralis> Babaus SUCK
[2:47:48] <%Gogogolem> it just whose infront
[2:47:52] <CruxAustralis> I HATE GETTING SNEAK ATTACKED
[2:47:54] <MemAlephh> everyone rolls perception which is why its a good idea to level it on everyone
[2:47:55] <%redthebaron> i think everyone rolls for perception
[2:47:58] <notsoy> seelah  maybe should be in the back until you can heal her?
[2:48:12] <+Shonen_hero> you'll get that soon. You don't have to worry about combat. You'll rest before you have to worry about combat again
[2:48:16] <+Speed1ines> found it in the dirt
[2:48:17] <CruxAustralis> also the fireball demons
[2:48:17] <zerointelligence000> wow those guys suck at finding shit
[2:48:18] <+MisterAvry> well that was easy
[2:48:18] <+emperri> ez clap
[2:48:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Oooooh a MAGIC SWORD
[2:48:25] <+kawachipto> @cruxaustralis yeah their stealth crits were super annoying
[2:48:25] <DSD24> Aww yeah I love these parts
[2:48:28] <CruxAustralis> but those you can at least Protection Against Energy
[2:48:35] <+JJJKopf> hey you found the game's gimmick
[2:48:35] <MemAlephh> WORDS
[2:48:36] <%alphonseisbest> yoo
[2:48:37] <%RealThiele> barf text
[2:48:38] <+Shonen_hero> oh no not your stigmata wound
[2:48:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> These are straight out of Pillars.
[2:48:42] <+vaderxyz1970> How do you misplace that
[2:48:43] <CruxAustralis> @kawachipto yeah them turning invisible also sucks
[2:48:45] <+emperri> thots burst
[2:49:00] <joodatious> wow that art quality

[2:51:56] <%hrbeck_> punish
[2:51:57] <CruxAustralis> TIME TO MAKE A CHOICE
[2:51:59] <+Shonen_hero> punish baddies or save goodies
[2:52:02] <+MisterAvry> save the peepo
[2:52:03] <%MugenSandan> Superman would choose 2
[2:52:05] <notsoy> your alignment is chaotic good, consider this
[2:52:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> 2
[2:52:06] <CruxAustralis> SAVE
[2:52:07] <%Deft_Thought> That's a lame sword
[2:52:09] <CruxAustralis> SAVE THE ANIMALS
[2:52:11] <%TheDullaMAN> He protecc
[2:52:18] <%sandrews> y'all really don't speed read?
[2:52:20] <%Kyma1020> save the peepo
[2:52:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Don't worry about that lol.
[2:52:25] <CruxAustralis> I love that art
[2:52:30] <%darklordfodder> punish, you're an Inquisitor
[2:52:31] <+MisterAvry> mouse over them to see if they have a thing?
[2:52:32] <+vaderxyz1970> What would Woolie pick
[2:52:33] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt THIS WILL DEFINE YOUR FUTURE
[2:52:35] <%chiazam> No it won’t
[2:52:37] <%Agami23> your a gamer, not a roleplayer
[2:52:38] <Visorak6> Its a hard habit to break pat
[2:52:39] <tanarath> he attacc or he protecc?
[2:52:41] <%cooldude69xx> KILL
[2:52:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt No this won't.
[2:52:48] <+Shonen_hero> I think this is just purely flavor rn, some story book options aren't, but I think this one is
[2:52:50] <$mattynezz> It's all RP, this choice means little
[2:52:52] <%laserbeaming> don't worry about that, stuff that affects buffs has a [Mythic Path Required] thing
[2:52:53] <+kawachipto> inquisit or whiny priest
[2:52:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is roleplaying stuff not buff stuff.
[2:52:58] <+DragonArt07> this just unlocks an option
[2:52:58] <SolumFuturae> Will I need time stop
[2:53:00] <%MugenSandan> This is a goblin you must kill yourself dear Pat
[2:53:01] <+MisterAvry> yay
[2:53:02] <@Ranryu692> who cares, you'll probably replace the sword in like a hour anyway
[2:53:02] <huskarl_zap> play to lore
[2:53:05] <+GimmMeASammich> All mythic paths can beat the game. You are fine, just do what you feel is right @PatStaresAt
[2:53:05] <%Monkeyweed21> BabyRage psaGoblin
[2:53:07] <+kawachipto> Game usually tell you if it's like that
[2:53:09] <%cooldude69xx> It's a video game habit. It happens to a lot of people at some point
[2:53:13] <%alphonseisbest> pathfinder seems all about that RP
[2:53:14] <%chiazam> It doesn’t
[2:53:19] <enreimirai> It, in fact, influences if you can unlock certain mythic paths. Tho this one doesnt matter much
[2:53:22] <CruxAustralis> my sword :)
[2:53:22] <%laserbeaming> the sword is inside you now
[2:53:27] <%Felhad> this is a forever "sord"
[2:53:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> This one doesn't matter at all lol
[2:53:46] <tanarath> pat has sord
[2:53:47] <akitanito> oh no this is fate stay night
[2:53:51] <%RealThiele> my dick glows now babe
[2:53:56] <+Pendragwn> new dick sword get
[2:53:59] <joodatious> wow this voice for Lann
[2:54:03] <+ShoggothLibrarian> It's a metaphorical sword
[2:54:16] <+Shonen_hero> yeah that's right
[2:54:16] <DSD24> Lann sounds unique
[2:54:18] <CruxAustralis> D:
[2:54:19] <akitanito> you're a dwarf tho
[2:54:24] <@Ranryu692> also you're the first one to touch it since the Locust Demon came back
[2:54:25] <joodatious> Lann sounds like one of those weird voices in Gothic
[2:54:26] <%Deft_Thought> You're absolutely a freak
[2:54:29] <+MisterAvry> she's peanut butter and JELLY
[2:54:32] <$mattynezz> You do for that funky Demon hole in your chest
[2:54:35] <%hrbeck_> heh taint
[2:54:36] <DSD24> The Taint
[2:54:36] <%HotSauceFiend> Patron has no taint
[2:54:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now, now, Wenduag, don't be a WenduHAG
[2:54:38] <%Felhad> dont be mean to spider Mace Wendu
[2:54:47] <%PhysicsLB> heh heh heh mongrel taint
[2:54:49] <%RealThiele> taint
[2:54:49] <%TheWinged7> heh heh taint
[2:54:58] <%laserbeaming> You always start with Angel, you swap later
[2:55:03] <+Shonen_hero> Abyss is the super hell
[2:55:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt THIS WILL MATTER
[2:55:11] <huskarl_zap> so tired of this 5th edition muh evil bodies but not souls shit
[2:55:12] <RedPlasticCup> ???
[2:55:17] <+vaderxyz1970> One drop rule i guess
[2:55:19] <joodatious> was kingmakers dialogue this awkward?
[2:55:20] <%sandrews> lol sucked
[2:55:21] <+kawachipto> @laserbeaming you can skip the sword I think
[2:55:25] <%greasypete00> BOP
[2:55:25] <+Shonen_hero> heh
[2:55:26] <+megaman_sentinel> hes tainted kill him
[2:55:27] <+kewlmyc> Pat, stop
[2:55:28] <%Deft_Thought> Gotta love D&D--"You're not genetically TAINTED by EVIL like we are because of our ANCESTRY."
[2:55:31] <@Ranryu692> no you won't, pussy
[2:55:38] <%TheWinged7> yeah pat, jsut whip it out live on stream
[2:55:38] <+MisterAvry> relatable, Lann
[2:55:41] <%laserbeaming> @kawachipto can you?
[2:55:42] <%TheWinged7> sipsipGasm
[2:55:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Lann is basically insufferable.
[2:55:48] <+vaderxyz1970> BUT WHAT IF DMC RULES THOUGH
[2:55:50] <%alphonseisbest> GAWD i HATE HIM
[2:55:52] <%sandrews> yes whip your light out in the public meeting hall
[2:55:54] <+WeLucklessJacks> W H I P  I T  O U T
[2:55:54] <%HotSauceFiend> so does anyone else's stream go back and forth a little bit or is it just by rogers network being dumb.
[2:55:55] <%laserbeaming> you have it
[2:56:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you got it.
[2:56:04] <+Pendragwn> @Deft_Thought Pathfinder tried to move away from that with second edition and some people lost their shit
[2:56:06] <AzureGale> DARK PHOENIX RISES
[2:56:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> You have angel powers now.
[2:56:13] <$mattynezz> @deft_thought it's radiation poisoning, it has nothing to do with ancestry
[2:56:13] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  You don't have to commit to a path yet, when you commit you get locked out.
[2:56:13] <+DragonArt07> this unlocks the path
[2:56:16] <%HotSauceFiend> Blessed with sword, not with height
[2:56:20] <akitanito> big call out
[2:56:26] <+Shonen_hero> So those descriptors will help influence what mythic powers you can potentially unlock later in the first act of the story
[2:56:31] <%RealThiele> #bless
[2:56:32] <+MisterAvry> awww, get that girl some sunlight
[2:56:38] <tanarath> Big spider sploosh
[2:56:40] <%Kyma1020> let them lose their shit, ttrpgs need to move away from that
[2:56:45] <%cooldude69xx> @Deft_Thought I think it'd be easier if people were more able to separate fentasy species from real people
[2:56:52] <joodatious> please kill lann i cant stand hearing him talk
[2:57:04] <%alphonseisbest> ^^^^
[2:57:09] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hey can you make out with the spider lady?
[2:57:15] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:57:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cooldude69xx Those people are idiots
[2:57:22] <Ika1> What difficulty are you playing on Pat?
[2:57:23] <+kawachipto> I always kill lann LUL
[2:57:25] <Blaven2> blaven1Think
[2:57:39] <+kawachipto> @justanothertrapartist of course you can
[2:57:40] <+Shonen_hero> yeah I like that too
[2:57:42] <%laserbeaming> Normal might be too hard
[2:57:45] <$mattynezz> Sors have it to you
[2:57:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> Just now
[2:57:48] <@Ranryu692> prrobably when you got the angel's sword
[2:57:51] <$mattynezz> Sors
[2:57:51] <notsoy> check out your new sword?
[2:57:54] <%TheWinged7> the sord
[2:57:54] <DSD24> Head on directly to the forehead
[2:57:55] <%sandrews> light sword give protec from evil?
[2:57:55] <$mattynezz> Sord
[2:57:56] <tanarath> valid
[2:57:59] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @kawachipto God bless
[2:58:04] <tanarath> Sord
[2:58:05] <+kawachipto> move them
[2:58:07] <+Shonen_hero> you just click and drag those icons
[2:58:10] <+kawachipto> the tiles
[2:58:14] <Ika1> Im playing on Core and I literally cant do anything in act 2, everything is kicking my ass so hard
[2:58:14] <joodatious> hehe penis
[2:58:17] <CruxAustralis> it's the best one lmao
[2:58:20] <$mattynezz> The penis formation
[2:58:20] <zerointelligence000> good for caves maybe?
[2:58:22] <DSD24> You can edit them Pat
[2:58:22] <+JJJKopf> it's for real time Pat
[2:58:24] <+MisterAvry> hammer seems good
[2:58:29] <KingSpunf> 8===>
[2:58:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> The auto formation assumes you're being ranged because you're an inquisitor.
[2:58:35] <shambarino> The classic cocknballs formation
[2:58:40] <DSD24> Zen Archer
[2:58:42] <+Shonen_hero> Lann and Wendu are your range, so it's fine to keep 'em in the back
[2:58:43] <mikeriffic> Party managment time yeyeye
[2:58:45] <%laserbeaming> for default formations you are, activate point blank shot, it's a toggle
[2:58:46] <%RealThiele> thrust into adventure
[2:58:48] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought I mean fantasy races are based off of real cultures and ethnicities. Pretending like they exist independently ain't it either.
[2:58:57] <%AgniBrandt> Hold up is Lann a Zen archer?
[2:59:01] <Ika1> Those abilities are very situational so not worth bein on the bar
[2:59:07] <DSD24> Neutral Evil Wendy
[2:59:11] <%AgniBrandt> FUCK YEAH
[2:59:11] <Visorak6> Those "other" abilities are like the 8 "default" actions in Baldurs Gate 3 pat
[2:59:17] <%laserbeaming> Bow Fighter
[2:59:17] <sun312772> Hot
[2:59:17] <+DragonArt07> you can drag them on and off
[2:59:18] <+kawachipto> lann is super busted zen archer
[2:59:20] <akitanito> I misheard that as awful neutral
[2:59:21] <+Shonen_hero> the hot bars in this game are sloppy and sort of just add abilities to the bar for every new skill, class ability or feat action you get
[2:59:32] <%AgniBrandt> Zen archers are cool as fuck
[2:59:33] <%PhysicsLB> fighters can make some boss ass archers
[2:59:38] <+ShoggothLibrarian> You can turn off auto-adding of abilities to bars
[2:59:39] <%laserbeaming> Lann is indeed the best party member.
[2:59:47] <+BedHome> Fantasy characters are also made to act realistic so you can, you know, roll play, you want chaotic evil monster to kill without thinking go play wow or something as you cant even play ff14 with that mindset
[2:59:50] <sun312772> I would stick my D@#$ in that b
[2:59:54] <+vaderxyz1970> Fighter Spider Fighter Spider Does Whaterver a Fighter Spider Does
[3:00:00] <tanarath> My guess is each button is based on a thing. One is skill-vased, one is class-based, one is innate spells, one is level 1 magic etc
[3:00:04] <%laserbeaming> lol
[3:00:12] <+JJJKopf> LUL
[3:00:15] <Ika1> Dice rolls lol
[3:00:15] <zerointelligence000> you had to highlight everyone
[3:00:18] <+TheAdMerlin> It failed twice
[3:00:19] <+Shonen_hero> you failed two checks in a row
[3:00:21] <DSD24> Third times the charm
[3:00:23] <+Thunderhawk47> I hate this game so much i went and installed Pillars of Eternity
[3:00:27] <%Nekros4442> you failed twice and you succeeded the third time
[3:00:30] <Visorak6> Thats funny in kingmaker failing mobility checks used to get you across but take damage
[3:00:31] <@Ranryu692> and then he hit a nat 20
[3:00:37] <+JJJKopf> you probably rolled like 2
[3:00:41] <+MisterAvry> guess you just had to keep trying
[3:00:45] <DSD24> Spoider
[3:00:46] <akitanito> now you're stuck
[3:00:52] <+MisterAvry> two of em
[3:00:56] <AngryAsian5> BIG SPOODER
[3:00:58] <%PhysicsLB> big fookin spider
[3:01:00] <akitanito> fight spider with spider
[3:01:00] <%cooldude69xx> @Deft_Thought Not all of them are, And the ones that are would be best used by distancing them from that past IMO.
[3:01:03] <+kawachipto> @thunderhawk47 umm ok, have fun I guess
[3:01:06] <+ShoggothLibrarian> It's a moderately-sized spider at best
[3:01:12] <tanarath> this is why take 10 should be automatic outside of combat
[3:01:25] <KingSpunf> Don't let spider bite you! Spiderbite HURT!
[3:01:34] <+ItalianWaifu> move in straight line and attack
[3:01:35] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:35] <%cooldude69xx> Charge is kill
[3:01:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Those spiders are twitchy
[3:01:45] <%vaporousTippler> Have to have an unobstructed (even debris) straight line, not too close. Bonus to hit, penalty to AC.
[3:01:50] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt it gets you in position and then attack in the same motion
[3:01:54] <%athuramn> the SAB system
[3:01:56] <$mattynezz> No you didn't
[3:01:59] <RedPlasticCup> charge is bugged and doesn't do anything sometimes
[3:02:01] <%TheFabledAble> nice
[3:02:06] <%vaporousTippler> Also rapiers suck for charges. They get no real bonuses.
[3:02:08] <Blaven2> Charge is essentially running ina straight line at the enemy and attacking, even if they are beyond your movement limit (usually 20-30).
[3:02:10] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> There you go
[3:02:16] <KingSpunf> Ooh, turn-based!
[3:02:18] <$mattynezz> Charge is only bugged while mounted
[3:02:24] <%alphonseisbest> @tanarath OMG THIS, why do more CRPGS not have this?!
[3:02:25] <+Shonen_hero> charge is for when you normally can't move and then attack, so it lets you do both in one action
[3:02:29] <@Ranryu692> it's being sneaky
[3:02:31] <+JJJKopf> auto-cast
[3:02:32] <+kawachipto> auto cast
[3:02:34] <%laserbeaming> Right click means you'll always use it on left click. Don't dothat
[3:02:36] <+ShoggothLibrarian> You right-clicked, that's auto-cast
[3:02:36] <ScrubTheNerd> That makes it your default attack when you left click
[3:02:36] <Visorak6> I think thats to set it as an auto-use
[3:02:40] <+DragonArt07> auto
[3:02:49] <$mattynezz> You Right Clicked, that sets it to AutoCast
[3:02:50] <%vaporousTippler> Mounts run into (pun intended) more mobility (another intended pun) glitches than unmounted.
[3:02:58] <+Shonen_hero> you don't have line of sight for charge
[3:03:00] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> What difficulty is Pat playing on?
[3:03:01] <%Nekros4442> can't charge through an ally
[3:03:05] <Blaven2> Yeah, you can't charge because Seelah is in the way.
[3:03:08] <%cooldude69xx> @tanarath It's even been part of tabletop for a while too. Like 15 years
[3:03:09] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt auto cast is more for realtime
[3:03:11] <Flagnalok> Auto cast is real time mode
[3:03:13] <+DerivedKnight> Auto cast only matters during Real Time Combat
[3:03:14] <%Ghufufin> seelahs fat ass is in the way
[3:03:15] <notsoy> because you're a slowpoke
[3:03:17] <%laserbeaming> don't ever auto cast if you are playing in turn based mode
[3:03:20] <akitanito> that sword is too heavy for you
[3:03:21] <+GimmMeASammich> It is for not turnbased @PatStaresAt
[3:03:22] <DSD24> Well you are a Dwarf
[3:03:25] <+Shonen_hero> because you're a rock
[3:03:28] <%vaporousTippler> You don't run in heavier armor unless charging.
[3:03:29] <%athuramn> it's not like she became un fatigued
[3:03:29] <tanarath> Because 'when it's not of benefit to the story/not dramatic/use your best judgement' is dumb @alphonseisbest
[3:03:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because you're a dwarf with tiny legs carrying a weapon that's very heavy.
[3:03:34] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt you use it for mages and stuff so they use a spell automatically instead of normal attack
[3:03:43] <+MisterAvry> razzle dazzle
[3:04:01] <DSD24> Anevia's putting in work
[3:04:02] <+MisterAvry> wrecked
[3:04:05] <%laserbeaming> Archers are busted
[3:04:09] <+Shonen_hero> not even your archers. That was Anevia LUL
[3:04:11] <signofzeta> yeah archers are kinda strong
[3:04:17] <tanarath> Just generalize it & explain why. Also gygax was a glutton for suffering & metagaming
[3:04:18] <$mattynezz> Auto Cast actually does affect TB mode, it changes what happens with a regular left click
[3:04:21] <%alphonseisbest> @tanarath wait why do u think take 10 is dumb?
[3:04:27] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Anevia can solo this whole bit if you hand back
[3:04:36] <+JJJKopf> a lot fucking faster
[3:04:37] <+Shonen_hero> crafting mats
[3:04:37] <%cooldude69xx> @tanarath If the story would be a dud because a check or two was passed on a ten, the DC should have been one higher
[3:04:38] <+kawachipto> Ann was just tired of you idiots not fighting LUL
[3:04:46] <%laserbeaming> I find these games near unplayable in Real Time
[3:04:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> look dudes! there's shrooms among us!
[3:05:06] <tanarath> No, taking 10 is great, the explaination of how to use it is dumb @alphonseisbest
[3:05:14] <DSD24> Man Lann is such a dork
[3:05:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> God I hate Lann
[3:05:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Do casters still only use cantrips when at full spells in this game?
[3:05:18] <%TheFabledAble> hes the one with the biggest mobility bonus
[3:05:23] <%Piemono> Only your highest skill level counts for Skill Checks
[3:05:23] <%Agami23> am i the only one who wants to throw lann down a pit?
[3:05:24] <joodatious> @tanarath its about improvising not strict storytelling
[3:05:31] <%alphonseisbest> @tanarath oh ok
[3:05:32] <+JJJKopf> it auto chooses the character with the highest skill
[3:05:36] <joodatious> otherwise just read a book
[3:05:49] <tanarath> Yeah, p much
[3:05:55] <+kawachipto> press space
[3:05:57] <+ShoggothLibrarian> The AI seems busted and won't cast even with the setting to enable them to use limited-use things on, yeah
[3:05:58] <%laserbeaming> you can switch to turn based at any time
[3:06:01] <%chiazam> Move her all the way to the back then
[3:06:02] <tanarath> But sometimes dice fuck shit up
[3:06:05] <DSD24> Man I love the Agressive Voice
[3:06:14] <DSD24> Its a good voice for ladies too
[3:06:28] <DSD24> Its a lot faster
[3:06:36] <%Nekros4442> dont forget to save
[3:06:43] <%cooldude69xx> OH HELL YEAH
[3:06:43] <%alphonseisbest> @joodatious but wait aren't crpgs Mostly books anyway?
[3:06:45] <%athuramn> 15 charges??
[3:06:49] <$mattynezz> Give that to Camellia
[3:07:05] <+Shonen_hero> Yeah I recommend turn based for the harder fights, but RtwP for most trash mobs
[3:07:09] <DSD24> That's a item you put on the hotbar
[3:07:09] <%laserbeaming> equip the wand, it'll appear on your belt
[3:07:12] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt its a consumable with 15 uses that uses the cure wound spell
[3:07:13] <tanarath> Emergancy healing
[3:07:15] <%cooldude69xx> Aw, they still get up to 50 charges I hope
[3:07:17] <%athuramn> the spell is available to camellia apparently (near the top)
[3:07:18] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt give the wand to cam she can use it
[3:07:18] <$mattynezz> Put it on someone's belt, next to the potions
[3:07:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you can use the ability 15 times.
[3:07:19] <joodatious> @joodatious only the bad ones.
[3:07:20] <enreimirai> Give to Camellia, and she can use it 15 times to cast cure light wounds
[3:07:20] <chaosbringer28> how many uses it has
[3:07:21] <%laserbeaming> you can use it 15 times to Cure Light Wounds
[3:07:21] <+Shonen_hero> You can use it fifteen times before it gets used up
[3:07:28] <Scrub_Seeker> think of it like a healing potion with 15 uses
[3:07:36] <joodatious> just look at disco Elysium
[3:07:36] <%athuramn> -shrugs-
[3:07:38] <notsoy> she's the one who is able to use wands?
[3:07:38] <akitanito> because you're a frontliner
[3:07:39] <%laserbeaming> it works on either you or Camellia
[3:07:40] <DSD24> I think Pat can use it
[3:07:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because she's your only mage.
[3:07:41] <%TheFabledAble> you dont, they just like assigning roles
[3:07:42] <+kawachipto> gives you 15 uses of heal spell
[3:07:44] <%Nekros4442> you dont have "Use Magic Device" iirc
[3:07:45] <+vaderxyz1970> @ShoggothLibrarian Thats the one thing about KingMaker that though my anoyence to the roof. You are a level 10 wizzard with at least 6 spell slots partymember STOP USING ACID ARROW
[3:07:46] <+Pendragwn> Inquisitors can use it
[3:07:49] <Flagnalok> You can use it as an Inquisitor
[3:07:50] <$mattynezz> She already had Cure, so can cast without any skill checks
[3:07:51] <tanarath> A better healing potion.
[3:07:52] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Guys stop, Pat can also use it
[3:07:52] <+Shonen_hero> Because she has a high use magic device
[3:08:01] <enreimirai> Either you or her can use it, but usually shes the healer
[3:08:01] <chaosbringer28> dont wands need a use magic device check or am i misremembering when that comes up
[3:08:02] <+JJJKopf> you need Use Magic Device skill
[3:08:10] <chaosbringer28> and pats UMD is negative
[3:08:12] <%laserbeaming> you can also cast without skill checks
[3:08:16] <$mattynezz> If you cast a spell you don't know, you need to a skill checks
[3:08:18] <%alphonseisbest> @joodatious but people love Disco, and that has no gameplay, just reading like any Vn
[3:08:20] <%laserbeaming> you don't need use magic device
[3:08:21] <+DeadPhoenix3> pat can use it without use device
[3:08:26] <enreimirai> wands need use magic device if you dont have the spell. If you have it, its free to cast
[3:08:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> You don't have to roll UMD if you can cast the spell yourself
[3:08:26] <$mattynezz> b
[3:08:26] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> stripPalm
[3:08:26] <%Piemono> Its in Bag
[3:08:28] <%laserbeaming> in the B, for Belt
[3:08:29] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you can use it as you are so youre fine, just fyi more powerful consumables require magic device skill to be high
[3:08:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> B
[3:08:31] <+Shonen_hero> b is for belt
[3:08:31] <+JJJKopf> B for belt
[3:08:32] <+Pendragwn> Chat is just super wrong you can use it
[3:08:34] <%RealThiele> woolieONEGUY
[3:08:35] <DSD24> Nice
[3:08:36] <Flagnalok> All divine casters can use the wand, most people probably played other classes
[3:08:41] <@GeneralSCPatton> woolieONEGUY
[3:08:46] <enreimirai> cure light wounds is an inquisitor spell, so he can use it
[3:08:51] <enreimirai> NOP
[3:08:52] <%laserbeaming> no
[3:08:54] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt no
[3:08:54] <$mattynezz> no
[3:08:55] <ScrubTheNerd> Not this one
[3:08:55] <%Ghufufin> you need to be able to cast the spell normally like a cleric or inquisitor or have the UMD skill
[3:08:57] <%Ghufufin> no
[3:08:57] <@GeneralSCPatton> NOPE
[3:08:58] <+JJJKopf> I guess it works for any spell caster
[3:08:58] <chaosbringer28> ah thats right, it tied to what class has what
[3:08:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> Never.
[3:08:59] <%TheDullaMAN> Nope.
[3:09:00] <+JJJKopf> nope
[3:09:01] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can ge tmore
[3:09:01] <+kawachipto> no
[3:09:02] <notsoy> you just get another one, don't worry
[3:09:02] <akitanito> why would you use three charges before asking
[3:09:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> But it's a trash item.
[3:09:05] <+Shonen_hero> He doesn't need to worry about use magic device for healing stuff I don't think
[3:09:05] <chaosbringer28> nope
[3:09:08] <%PhysicsLB> no, but you should be able to buy more at some point
[3:09:09] <%cooldude69xx> Put Wand on party member with the spell. That includes Inquisitors and Shaman
[3:09:11] <%Piemono> It's just 15 health Potions Pat
[3:09:12] <+kawachipto> LUL
[3:09:12] <$mattynezz> LUL
[3:09:12] <tanarath> pat... no
[3:09:13] <+Pendragwn> @akitanito to do big heals
[3:09:15] <notsoy> you'll get similar items later on
[3:09:15] <Scrub_Seeker> mind goblins ACTIVATED
[3:09:15] <%MugenSandan> GOBLIN ACTIVATE
[3:09:15] <%Ghufufin> wands are cheap
[3:09:15] <enreimirai> you can get more, but these are basically consumables like potions
[3:09:16] <%Nekros4442> This is not a game where you save consumables Pat. If you hoard shit you will die
[3:09:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's a trash item Pat
[3:09:20] <%laserbeaming> @Ghufufin well, good thing he's an inquisitor
[3:09:20] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt pat there are SO MANY consumables, pls use them
[3:09:21] <+Pendragwn> No it's literally used for that
[3:09:22] <%athuramn> that's so weird that the tool tip doesn't bother including his own character in the usage
[3:09:23] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Don't worry about it, Cure Light Wounds is trash-tier
[3:09:24] <+DragonArt07> reload
[3:09:24] <chaosbringer28> there not hard to get
[3:09:24] <%TheDullaMAN> Pat, healing now will keep you from needing to heal later
[3:09:25] <+EXPsoon> it just a single wand,
[3:09:27] <+TreskM> You get so many healing pots and stuff its fine
[3:09:27] <+Shonen_hero> It's fine, like that wand will be useless in a couple levels
[3:09:27] <%Agami23> apply directly to the forehead
[3:09:28] <%vaporousTippler> Most tabletop groups wind up with bundles of cure wands.
[3:09:33] <gyde42> this game is draining Pats HP
[3:09:37] <$mattynezz> Pat, you get about 65 potions in the next dungeon, you're fine
[3:09:37] <zzNamttamzz> Not the healing wand
[3:09:38] <%RealThiele> cure light wounds is babys 1st heal its fine pat
[3:09:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> Then you buy more.
[3:09:39] <chaosbringer28> its literraly like a med bag, buy one with 50 charges, get a new one later
[3:09:44] <%Piemono> Pat Just think of it as 15 health potions
[3:09:49] <+ShoggothLibrarian> The tooltip tells you which characters *have* that spell, not which characters can *use* it
[3:09:51] <%TheDullaMAN> You can buy more wands and heals later
[3:09:52] <%Nekros4442> If you die then what does it matter if you wont have it later on
[3:09:52] <+skeletonmilk> this Hafu/Dog McDonalds commercial is cured as fuck
[3:09:52] <%TheFabledAble> archers op
[3:09:53] <+archangel9889> its fine just buy more!
[3:09:53] <+vaderxyz1970> Oh no
[3:09:55] <+Squidbit> better than using 0% of its max charges ever
[3:09:57] <tanarath> Pat, apparently they drown you in consumables, you'll always have several
[3:09:58] <+skeletonmilk> *cursed
[3:10:02] <%Piemono> Lann is a great Archer
[3:10:04] <%TheFabledAble> zen archer which lann has is one of the best ranged dps
[3:10:10] <+Shonen_hero> Yeah but you can only use cure light wounds spell. Which works for now, but as you get more health it'll be a pain to try to use that wand to heal to full
[3:10:15] <+DeadPhoenix3> unless they changed how it works, wands start with 50 charages normally. you just found a shit one
[3:10:16] <DSD24> Anevia da best
[3:10:16] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> @athuramn The tool tip says who has Cure light wounds as known spells, it doesn't show Pat's character as he didnt pick it but he'd still be able to use the wand without issue because hes a divine spellcaster
[3:10:16] <%hrbeck_> It’s like using an iron ore in monhun
[3:10:21] <tanarath> The rule is that you need several, not an army's worth.
[3:10:21] <+Shonen_hero> because I think cure light wound heals 1d4 health?
[3:10:23] <%athuramn> I'm surprised this system wo rks as well as it does
[3:10:27] <evilshamus> hey pat, just finished Baldurs Gate 1 and it wasn't bad. what would you recommend next for similar games
[3:10:37] <%TheFabledAble> TLDR: big number good, low number bad
[3:10:42] <+Pendragwn> @evilshamus baldurs gate 2
[3:10:46] <+DeadPhoenix3> cure light wounds wand give 1d8+1
[3:10:51] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> How does the game stack up to D:OS2 in terms of accessibility?
[3:10:53] <DSD24> You got good dex
[3:10:54] <Parapattern> Pat sounds like what I headcanon Zubaz to sound like
[3:11:00] <%laserbeaming> you've had bad luck, and you're not a full melee class
[3:11:00] <%athuramn> @lewd_sister_of_battle yeah, but the  tool tip says "available to". It's just weird wording imo
[3:11:01] <Visorak6> You only have a +3, thats expected early on
[3:11:01] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt youre using a martial weapon which you dont have proficiency with
[3:11:02] <+Pendragwn> It just means you made a bad character clearly
[3:11:02] <%Wallabri> that's rollin' dice for ya
[3:11:04] <enreimirai> You use str to hit with melee
[3:11:05] <$mattynezz> Str, not Dex
[3:11:05] <%cooldude69xx> What is your attack bonus?
[3:11:06] <@GeneralSCPatton> Do you have Proficiency?
[3:11:06] <%Ghufufin> dex is not to hit
[3:11:06] <%laserbeaming> Dex doesn't affect hit chance for you
[3:11:08] <+Shonen_hero> greatsword is for STR
[3:11:08] <DSD24> It good just be bad rolls Pat
[3:11:09] <+TreskM> Its str for melee attack
[3:11:10] <ScrubTheNerd> That's what level 1 is like
[3:11:11] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you need to use a "simple" weapon
[3:11:12] <%Ghufufin> str to hit with melee weapon
[3:11:12] <%Nobrev> just rolled bad
[3:11:13] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> @athuramn true
[3:11:13] <akitanito> is it because you're using a greatsword as a dwarf?
[3:11:13] <chaosbringer28> str based
[3:11:13] <%Nekros4442> Dex doesnt matter. You're rolling with Strength
[3:11:14] <+DeadPhoenix3> your str is fine, you are just rolling low
[3:11:16] <ComfyFox> u  need str
[3:11:16] <+DragonArt07> it uses str
[3:11:17] <+JJJKopf> str determines if you hit
[3:11:19] <+miffedmuffins> @PatStaresAt great swords need strength to wield right
[3:11:19] <+MisterAvry> Dice Christ hates you?
[3:11:21] <%laserbeaming> He has proficiency
[3:11:22] <%TheFabledAble> oh wait thats right
[3:11:23] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Greatswords use STR
[3:11:23] <Darkfire346> zubaz is an angry superman-hating ginger?
[3:11:24] <SolumFuturae> attack shows +3 right there, it should be fine
[3:11:25] <chaosbringer28> dex is used for ranged weapons and certain melee, str is used for melee
[3:11:25] <tanarath> Str not Dex
[3:11:26] <%Nekros4442> Also you arent trained with Greatswords iirc
[3:11:27] <$mattynezz> Your fine, just bad luck
[3:11:27] <+JJJKopf> you're just level 1
[3:11:29] <+DragonArt07> your using a str weapon
[3:11:29] <%RealThiele> its str based thats why people saying WIS more than STR were dumb
[3:11:31] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Unless you have Weapon Finesse, you use STR not DEX. This game doesn't let you equip weapons you aren't proficient with.
[3:11:32] <%HolePunchLeaf> he has 16 str tho chat
[3:11:33] <joodatious> pat has str
[3:11:34] <%Piemono> No different weapons use different stats, most use strength or Dex
[3:11:34] <enreimirai> At 1st lvl, you just dont have good chances to hit. This gets better as you level.
[3:11:35] <%AyotoCorp> You just have bad dice luck
[3:11:37] <+miffedmuffins> Bad rolls then
[3:11:37] <YuriSix_> bad rolls
[3:11:39] <%Gogogolem> You're just getting unlucky
[3:11:41] <%Wallabri> dice do be like that
[3:11:41] <%TheDullaMAN> It's just bad rolls
[3:11:41] <%cooldude69xx> Inquisitor magic shit buffs you
[3:11:42] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you just dont have bery high accuracy atm but thats fine
[3:11:42] <+Shonen_hero> You also don't have feats that will increase your attack roll
[3:11:43] <akitanito> just bad rolls then
[3:11:43] <%vaporousTippler> Level 1s are lucky to tie their shoes.
[3:11:43] <%Ghufufin> u are half fighter man half cleric man, other folks are all fighter man
[3:11:43] <joodatious> also this lvl one
[3:11:44] <+Rolandknight> how hard are you playing it on.
[3:11:44] <DSD24> I remember it being real rough at level 1
[3:11:44] <Visorak6> Mouse over your attack and see the breakdown?
[3:11:45] <bigboy3d> It's the nature of d20 games
[3:11:45] <%TheFabledAble> mb
[3:11:46] <Parapattern> @Darkfire346 I meant his character
[3:11:47] <chaosbringer28> +5
[3:11:49] <+Shonen_hero> which you will get later
[3:11:49] <tanarath> Bad rolls
[3:11:51] <Flagnalok> Inquisitor also has 3/4 BAB
[3:11:52] <lord_sykos> low level dnd for you
[3:11:53] <Darkfire346> yo also have -5 to height
[3:11:53] <%Agami23> when in doubt, blame the rolls
[3:11:54] <%alphonseisbest> rng
[3:11:54] <chaosbringer28> +3 from str +2 from class, look bottem left
[3:11:54] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> @PatStaresAt You are level 1, its just the roll of the dice.
[3:11:55] <+Rolandknight> that effect the rolls
[3:11:56] <%Valdorick> Just roll better, lol
[3:11:56] <enreimirai> Go play baldurs gate, at lvl 1 you cant hit the broad side of a barn
[3:11:58] <@Ranryu692> some nights you just get bad dice rolls
[3:12:02] <+DeadPhoenix3> you have a judement gives you+1 for a battle, though obviously you probably dont want o use it right now
[3:12:04] <%hrbeck_> Congrats, d20 systems suck ass
[3:12:13] <%athuramn> maybe that's why the archers are hauling ass - they're making up for your bad rng
[3:12:14] <%PhysicsLB> it's almost like pathfinder is basically 3.5
[3:12:14] <+Shonen_hero> yeah same
[3:12:15] <+JJJKopf> it's VERY close to tabletop
[3:12:17] <Blaven2> I mean... it should feel like Pathfinder.
[3:12:18] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt Tieflings are considered op cause they get an extra attack as a racial bonus.
[3:12:19] <+MisterAvry> you gotta get an attack that goes for Touch AC. That's much easier to hit
[3:12:21] <%laserbeaming> also, you're not a full attack class. You have less hit chance than Paladins or Fighters
[3:12:22] <%Nobrev> isn't pathfinder just based off 2.5e
[3:12:23] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Pathfinder is just 3.75 so that checks out
[3:12:26] <tanarath> Level 1 fucking sucks, get to 4 or 5 and it'll be better
[3:12:31] <%Gogogolem> missiing is common
[3:12:32] <akitanito> real-time was hilariously broken in arcanum
[3:12:34] <+Shonen_hero> I just use RtwP when I'm fighting like six goblins and they all have turns in the turn que
[3:12:34] <DSD24> Thank god you didn't get poisoned
[3:12:40] <Darkfire346> those are not spiderbros
[3:12:47] <%TheFabledAble> wow thats a bad roll
[3:12:51] <+archangel9889> yes use it
[3:12:56] <+Shonen_hero> You'd hit more with the crossbow honestly
[3:12:58] <+vaderxyz1970> Its Tabletop DD without friends
[3:13:06] <%TheFabledAble> theyre not per day theyre per REST
[3:13:09] <%athuramn> yeah, it really seems like you're just getting dog luck
[3:13:11] <+DeadPhoenix3> corssbow would suck
[3:13:12] <masheshardest> 0 levels spells
[3:13:17] <%RealThiele> a grappler in this must be baller
[3:13:17] <%TheFabledAble> USE THAT
[3:13:20] <%TheFabledAble> more accurate
[3:13:20] <+Shonen_hero> they're per long rest
[3:13:22] <Flagnalok> Not cold iron
[3:13:24] <%Ghufufin> +1 to hit
[3:13:25] <%alphonseisbest> @vaderxyz1970 so why even bother?
[3:13:26] <%vaporousTippler> Masterwork is +1 to hit, nothing more.
[3:13:27] <Scrub_Seeker> masterwork gives you a +1 to attack rolls
[3:13:28] <%TheDullaMAN> Cold Iron and Masterwork
[3:13:28] <+Squidbit> masterworks are worth money and have like +1 to attack or something like that
[3:13:29] <+DeadPhoenix3> masterwork has +1 attack
[3:13:29] <%Piemono> Master work give +1 to dmg
[3:13:31] <Visorak6> Masterwork has higher accuracy
[3:13:31] <+JJJKopf> masterwork is +1 to hit
[3:13:32] <%cooldude69xx> MAsterwork increases hit bonus I think
[3:13:33] <%TheFabledAble> masterwork gives +1 to hit
[3:13:33] <YuriSix_> masterwork is basically plus 1
[3:13:34] <+Pendragwn> Masterwork has better hit
[3:13:35] <%Gogogolem> +1 to hit
[3:13:35] <%laserbeaming> Bless lasts a minute, so if you go fast and pause when taking decisions you can probably carry it over for the whole thing
[3:13:36] <+Squidbit> right click > info, it tells you
[3:13:36] <%RealThiele> +1 to hit which is great
[3:13:37] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Masterwork is +1 to hit but won't bypass demon damage reduction
[3:13:39] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt keep Cold Iron trust me
[3:13:40] <$yeknomlive> master works all you cant go wrong
[3:13:40] <Ika1> +1 to hit with Masterwork, Cold Iron overcomes some resistances
[3:13:43] <%RealThiele> 5% more accuracy
[3:13:44] <chaosbringer28> cold iron gets bonuses against some things, masterwork is generally better
[3:13:45] <enreimirai> Masterwork gives a +1 to hit, cold iron is better vs demons
[3:13:48] <DSD24> Cold Ion is good for ghosts and demons
[3:13:48] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Cold Iron bypasses certain DR while masterwork is +1 to Hit
[3:13:49] <+MisterAvry> I hear masterwork gives you +1 to hit
[3:13:50] <+Shonen_hero> it has a damage descriptor, cold iron allows you to get around demon damage reduction
[3:13:51] <%TheFabledAble> cold iron bypasses dmg resist of demons
[3:13:52] <$mattynezz> @patstaresat What do you think about downloading a mod that gives you infinite casts, but then just putting up the difficulty?
[3:13:53] <%laserbeaming> Cold Iron is effective against demons
[3:13:54] <Visorak6> Cold iron ignores certain damage reductions (read: demons)
[3:13:55] <+DeadPhoenix3> cold iron goes though some damage resistence
[3:13:55] <%PhysicsLB> cold iron is dmg v fae
[3:13:55] <akitanito> maybe you'll finally hit something
[3:13:55] <CruxAustralis> IT'S NOT FLUFF
[3:13:58] <Flagnalok> Demons are weak to cold iron
[3:13:58] <ScrubTheNerd> NOT fluff, but useless right now
[3:13:59] <%athuramn> but why is cold iron worth more x_x
[3:13:59] <+kawachipto> no not fluff
[3:13:59] <%Piemono> Cold Iron is not Fluff Pat
[3:14:00] <CruxAustralis> IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT @PatStaresAt
[3:14:01] <%Nekros4442> Thats not fluff
[3:14:01] <+JJJKopf> effective against demons
[3:14:02] <DSD24> YOu could always have both
[3:14:03] <+JJJKopf> NOT FLUFF
[3:14:03] <%Nekros4442> That matters
[3:14:03] <+EXPsoon> Cold iron ignore dmg reduction on some monster
[3:14:04] <+emperri> masterworks all, cant go wrong
[3:14:04] <+DeadPhoenix3> cold iron is good for demons
[3:14:05] <CruxAustralis> this game is about beating demons
[3:14:06] <chaosbringer28> not fluff
[3:14:06] <%Piemono> IT SAYS THAT MAN
[3:14:07] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt deamons and fae take actually less damage from non cold iron
[3:14:08] <%TheDullaMAN> You READ IT
[3:14:08] <+DragonArt07> not fluff
[3:14:09] <%cooldude69xx> It has a symbol
[3:14:12] <%vaporousTippler> If you don't know, your character doesn't know.
[3:14:12] <YuriSix_> demons have damage res
[3:14:12] <chaosbringer28> does better against demons and fey
[3:14:13] <CruxAustralis> Demons get DR against a lot except Cold Iron
[3:14:15] <+BedHome> but you can switch them whenever
[3:14:19] <%TheFabledAble> you need to worry about accuracy before dmg bonuses
[3:14:22] <Flagnalok> The demon stat block says it on it, not the weapon
[3:14:22] <+EXPsoon> It has a descriptor
[3:14:22] <+kawachipto> demons have damage resist. cold iron ignores it
[3:14:23] <%TheDullaMAN> So?
[3:14:23] <+Squidbit> but it says effective against demons
[3:14:25] <akitanito> it's because it ignores
[3:14:25] <%laserbeaming> "Effective against demons and fey"
[3:14:26] <Visorak6> If its a Quality it matters
[3:14:27] <%athuramn> *implied*
[3:14:27] <%Piemono> DEMONS ARE RESISTANT TO NON COLD IRON
[3:14:27] <+BedHome> SOME THINGS DONT HAVE NUMBERS
[3:14:27] <chaosbringer28> it overides their DR, so there is no number
[3:14:28] <enreimirai> it ignores damage reduction vs demons or fey
[3:14:28] <CruxAustralis> by reading
[3:14:30] <%Nekros4442> The number will appear on the demon itself
[3:14:30] <%RealThiele> its a descriptor
[3:14:31] <+Squidbit> it's telling you it's a quality
[3:14:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> THE ENEMY'S DAMAGE REDUCTION WILL SAY THAT COLD IRON BYPASSES IT
[3:14:32] <+DeadPhoenix3> it ignores all cold iron DR
[3:14:32] <$mattynezz> There's a tutorial for that as soon as you meet a demon
[3:14:34] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> moon2SPIN
[3:14:34] <ScrubTheNerd> Because it bypasses Damage Reduction. That is variable based on the creature, not the weapoon
[3:14:34] <+Speed1ines> muh numbas
[3:14:35] <%laserbeaming> It's literal because it bypasses their defenses
[3:14:35] <joodatious> shut up
[3:14:36] <Ika1> Some ennemies will say in their stats they dont resist cold iron
[3:14:37] <YuriSix_> ITS A QUALITY
[3:14:38] <%TheDullaMAN> Why else would it say that?
[3:14:38] <%cooldude69xx> When you look at demons
[3:14:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he has a point, also how much more?
[3:14:40] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt through faith pat
[3:14:41] <%deviljhojho_> just be smarter 4Head
[3:14:42] <+allups> all text should have value
[3:14:45] <%vaporousTippler> You learn when you hit it with a normal weapon and it goes "Boink"
[3:14:45] <%Ynkubus_> not everything number
[3:14:46] <tanarath> SOMETIMES NUMBER NOT HAPPEN
[3:14:46] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Demons have Damage Reduction (DR) that *says* it's bypassed by Cold Iron
[3:14:47] <CruxAustralis> it says on the demon
[3:14:49] <chaosbringer28> its affects arent number, demons have a thing taht says reduce damage by x unless cold iron
[3:14:50] <%hrbeck_> Because Pathfinder sucks
[3:14:51] <+ALazo> whatever gamer man
[3:14:52] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Yeah I'm with Pat, that's dumb as fuck
[3:14:52] <+MisterAvry> they should at least highlight the words "demon" and "fey"
[3:14:52] <%Agami23> its iron, iron is always strong against fey
[3:14:56] <+Shonen_hero> it probably should I'm ngl
[3:14:57] <+allups> it should highlight key words at least
[3:15:00] <chaosbringer28> welcome to dnd
[3:15:02] <tanarath> It should
[3:15:03] <%sandrews> or highlight word
[3:15:04] <%TheDullaMAN> Number not always needed
[3:15:04] <Scrub_Seeker> regardless, you're better off with a sword that hits better because DR bypass doesn't matter if you miss
[3:15:05] <%cooldude69xx> What number would you like?
[3:15:06] <ComfyFox> oh no, number goblin
[3:15:08] <%chance_h> Should have read vampire lore book #2
[3:15:08] <joodatious> @Agami23 fuck you
[3:15:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> THE WEAKNESS IS PARTICULAR TO THE CREATURE
[3:15:10] <+Squidbit> the number varies between enemies, there's no number it could give you
[3:15:12] <%laserbeaming> budget ran out
[3:15:13] <DSD24> Ooo Wenduag has something for us
[3:15:14] <chaosbringer28> but yea it should be highlighted or something similar
[3:15:15] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt when you fight a demon and do the hover over inspect thing it says DAMAGE RESISTANCE 5: exception Cold Iron
[3:15:16] <Blaven2> @MisterAvry Yeah, that would draw the eye to them , at least.
[3:15:19] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Man Lann's design fucking blows
[3:15:20] <%RealThiele> special descriptor not good enough
[3:15:20] <+EXPsoon> number goblino in the makings
[3:15:20] <%JoshManVGH> Number is typically derived from formula in the sourcebooks.
[3:15:20] <enreimirai> Owlcat arent great at this. They are getting better over time, but yeah, not the best
[3:15:21] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Does Pat have number on him? if not how would we know his value?
[3:15:23] <%thebeargoesHONK> Babies first RPG- Pat
[3:15:23] <joodatious> budget gone
[3:15:25] <%CalderGaming> maybe that's one of those numbers that's supposed to be a mystery except for the DM
[3:15:30] <ape_hawk> FUCK THEM KIDS
[3:15:34] <$mattynezz> It's a type of damage reduction, Cold Iron ignores ALL Cold Iron Damage Reduction. No numbers involved
[3:15:41] <%Ghufufin> its funny how salty ppl get about d20 systems
[3:15:49] <%RealThiele> Michael Wenduag Jordan
[3:15:50] <+Shonen_hero> and you're pretty evil
[3:16:01] <%HolePunchLeaf> Pat's right, RPG's have superflous fluff all the time that says shit that doesn't actually enter gameplay, it should include it in the stat blot
[3:16:05] <+JJJKopf> the Lann with no plann
[3:16:12] <%athuramn> this game has a lot of "should have"
[3:16:14] <joodatious> god stop writing your text boxes in  paragraphs it makes reading feel long and boring
[3:16:18] <tanarath> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[3:16:20] <DSD24> Wenduag or Lann
[3:16:20] <+vaderxyz1970> Shes making sense
[3:16:25] <tanarath> HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[3:16:28] <+ALazo> whip it out pat
[3:16:29] <%laserbeaming> Or show the light and get the better companion
[3:16:34] <+MisterAvry> or do and find your own damn way through the maze
[3:16:38] <gyde42> @HolePunchLeaf Usually flavor text is in Italics or a different type color tho
[3:16:40] <notandrew101> it's gamer time
[3:16:40] <%RealThiele> says the evil for evil sake lady
[3:16:43] <enreimirai> You should probably kill wenduag, just in case
[3:16:52] <enreimirai> and help Lann, he seems nice.
[3:16:53] <%hrbeck_> Or get spider gremlin spussy
[3:16:55] <%drabberfaun535> what line?
[3:16:57] <DSD24> "You must gather your party before venturing forth"
[3:16:58] <+Pendragwn> pat it becoming angery
[3:17:01] <@GeneralSCPatton> You must gather your party before venturing forth.
[3:17:02] <%Nekros4442> fuck that get the spussy
[3:17:11] <+JJJKopf> you were close enough
[3:17:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @hrbeck_ that's a cursed sentence, thanks I hate it
[3:17:22] <+Shonen_hero> sometimes they get hung on the geometry of the exit, so the way to get unstuck is just to press back and then press it again
[3:17:26] <%cooldude69xx> I feel like these games don't work well with Pats goblins
[3:17:29] <%laserbeaming> Wenduag *is* romanceable
[3:17:37] <%vaporousTippler> You can rest a lot later. But it is limited with a mechanic.
[3:17:40] <%Gogogolem> Bad news
[3:17:41] <Visorak6> Nah not necessary here
[3:17:41] <%Gogogolem> Yes
[3:17:44] <%Nekros4442> You cannot spam rests in this game
[3:17:45] <$mattynezz> There's a mechanic to prevent that
[3:17:46] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt its not that bad, but it is pretty bad
[3:17:47] <%cooldude69xx> You might want to do that here
[3:17:47] <+JJJKopf> you can start doing that soon
[3:17:48] <%HolePunchLeaf> @gyde42 depends on the game tho right? and from a new player perspective how are you to know that's meaningful?
[3:17:48] <DSD24> Wenduag is for guys and gals
[3:17:49] <SolumFuturae> bad news
[3:17:50] <enreimirai> You literally cannot do that in this. You get punished via a mechanic if you overrest.
[3:17:50] <doctor_kelso> You get "punished" for over resting in this game.
[3:17:51] <+JJJKopf> but not neccessary
[3:17:53] <+ShoggothLibrarian> You get DEMON CORRUPTION if you rest too much
[3:17:54] <%Ghufufin> they purposely changed that
[3:17:54] <%NopeBadguy> That's because Icewind Dale was practically a toolset moreso than a game
[3:17:55] <%CopperTucker> so I've had a lot to drink
[3:18:00] <%CatRidder> you cant do that shit here
[3:18:01] <DSD24> Lann I'm pretty sure for ladies only
[3:18:02] <%Nekros4442> Thee is a mechanic that stops you from resting constantly
[3:18:02] <%RealThiele> COMA THAT SHIT
[3:18:04] <joodatious> BG3 has food to stop that.
[3:18:06] <%vaporousTippler> In Kingmaker, you needed heavy rations. In this game, you have to resist corruption per rest.
[3:18:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Kingmaker was that
[3:18:11] <%laserbeaming> it's not so dissimilar from that. But the fight buffs usually last really long at higher levels
[3:18:18] <+Shonen_hero> NPC yeah
[3:18:21] <PwnyB> As she should be. All those arms would go to waste if they weren't used for huggin'.
[3:18:21] <%RealThiele> sleep is for the devil
[3:18:23] <%Nekros4442> yes they dont matter
[3:18:26] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you have a LOT more spell casting to make up for it. and scrolls you can use for minor buffs to save your spells for combat
[3:18:27] <+Squidbit> there are exceptions to the unique name rule, but you'll be able to tell
[3:18:28] <%athuramn> that's right shitters, stay up and watch this stream or else you'll all get touched by the demon willies
[3:18:38] <doctor_kelso> Corruption applies a NASTY debuff if you rest too often outside of safe zones.
[3:18:39] <tanarath> Talk
[3:18:45] <+Shonen_hero> and he looks like a rat
[3:18:49] <enreimirai> rations in kingmaker were stupid. Its like 50lbs worth of random stuff to nap once. And its all disposable. So apparently my party are eating 50lbs of food when they rest.
[3:18:49] <tanarath> They might have something to say
[3:18:49] <+Shonen_hero> and he's the big cheese
[3:18:54] <+Shonen_hero> who makes all dah rules
[3:18:54] <DSD24> Ok here we go
[3:19:02] <$mattynezz> Corruption is what fucked up these dudes faces
[3:19:03] <%RealThiele> 250 exp Kreygasm
[3:19:10] <%Nekros4442> Nah fuck Lan, Chaotic all the way
[3:19:11] <%laserbeaming> yeah, that's wrong
[3:19:16] <%chiazam> What happened to the voice acting?
[3:19:18] <+Pendragwn> @enreimirai they eat big
[3:19:20] <%athuramn> LUL
[3:19:22] <%TheFabledAble> ASSOSIATED WITH A MYHTHIC PATH
[3:19:24] <DSD24> They are colored later
[3:19:27] <+kawachipto> LUL
[3:19:30] <%cooldude69xx> @chiazam budget gone
[3:19:32] <SolumFuturae> "finish" game
[3:19:33] <+Pendragwn> THAT'S BECAUSE THEY AREN'T MYTHIC
[3:19:34] <$lotharrio> HahaSweat HahaShrugRight
[3:19:35] <enreimirai> Look, Owlcat try, but they don't actually try well.
[3:19:37] <%linSP> (requires mythic path)
[3:19:43] <+Shonen_hero> there you go
[3:19:45] <+transporterthesequel> OH NOOOO
[3:19:52] <%laserbeaming> You won't set your mythic path until 2 chapters after this. Don't worry
[3:19:56] <%RealThiele> READING?!?! NOOOOOO
[3:19:56] <+Shonen_hero> you don't have it yet, this just helps you get angel stuff later
[3:19:58] <+transporterthesequel> yeah...YEAH....
[3:19:59] <%CatRidder> finish reading
[3:19:59] <%SirGO0SE> racist af tbh
[3:20:05] <%laserbeaming> just show the light, no bad consequences
[3:20:07] <+Shonen_hero> you'll get the option to choose it
[3:20:08] <%Sunriser41> this choice kinda maters a bit
[3:20:09] <+transporterthesequel> You don't want to know about Mythic Paths
[3:20:10] <joodatious> I feel like it would be smart to skip on this game until its "deluxe edition" came out
[3:20:10] <%Nekros4442> You do not have to take Angel here. You can get it later iirc
[3:20:11] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt this doesn't lock you into angel
[3:20:13] <+Shonen_hero> you won't be forced to
[3:20:14] <+archangel9889> are you choosing wich character joins your party?
[3:20:15] <+transporterthesequel> Just...just keep goin
[3:20:16] <SolumFuturae> no elp chat
[3:20:24] <%cooldude69xx> But the Spussy tho
[3:20:26] <tanarath> Choose dumb husbando or superior spider
[3:20:27] <%Piemono> You Don't get locked in
[3:20:28] <+Pendragwn> BIG CHAOTIC
[3:20:29] <%vaporousTippler> You can take a few alignment hits when you really want to.
[3:20:29] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah thats fine
[3:20:30] <CruxAustralis> doesn't matter
[3:20:30] <%strugglepunk2> It's a small tilt
[3:20:30] <%RealThiele> become what you must
[3:20:30] <+DragonArt07> Path is not set till much later so feel free to grab em all
[3:20:33] <%CatRidder> you can say 1 and 2 befor 3 or 4
[3:20:35] <%Nekros4442> Yeah so take Chaotic
[3:20:35] <%vaporousTippler> Just be chaotic later to make up for it.
[3:20:37] <sun312772> It doesn't matter here
[3:20:37] <Visorak6> It nudges you *slightly* towards neutral
[3:20:38] <%Gogogolem> it takes multiple decesions to change alignment
[3:20:38] <+BigCoffee> It's a slow slider
[3:20:38] <+Squidbit> it's not gonna change you over in one choice
[3:20:39] <CruxAustralis> you can do some lawful stuff
[3:20:39] <%Sunriser41> you can revert that prety easy
[3:20:42] <DSD24> You just started so it won't change right away
[3:20:42] <+transporterthesequel> Angel don't care
[3:20:45] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you can do a LOT of off alignment stuff without changing your alignment
[3:20:46] <%Ghufufin> alignment is bullshit and dont get too hung up on it
[3:20:46] <ScrubTheNerd> You don't ALWAYS have to follow chaotic
[3:20:47] <%Puhff> e Lawful response will not change your alignment
[3:20:49] <%strugglepunk2> You get a small move towards law
[3:20:49] <$lotharrio> As long as you don't go too heavy Lawful, you can do a little bit of it.
[3:20:49] <%Gogogolem> Its really really generous
[3:20:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> It's a slight nudge
[3:20:49] <+ShoggothLibrarian> You won't lose your alignment stuff unless you do it a WHOLE BUNCH
[3:20:50] <%JoshManVGH> But chaotic good puts you in one step
[3:20:50] <%Piemono> 3 is better in the long run
[3:20:50] <+DeadPhoenix3> one lawful action wont change you. you have to do it constantly
[3:20:51] <%laserbeaming> it won't matter that much, a lawful action here and then won't shift the alignment
[3:20:51] <YuriSix_> the change is gradual not immediate
[3:20:51] <%RealThiele> push a kid later
[3:20:52] <joodatious> i hate how this game does alignment
[3:20:52] <+kingdinkyI> This won’t lock you in
[3:20:52] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt dark side later
[3:20:55] <$mattynezz> Do you think Wendaug is right?
[3:20:57] <notsoy> you can always offset it later, just like KOTOR and other RPG alignment shit
[3:20:58] <tanarath> Alignment is just a vague thing
[3:20:59] <%PhysicsLB> COMPELLING CHARACTER CHOICES
[3:20:59] <%strugglepunk2> you don't have to hardcore go chaos all the time
[3:21:00] <+EXPsoon> It doesn't get locked by one option, you lock your choice in like 20 hours in
[3:21:00] <+transporterthesequel> yeah, it's REALLy easy to fix your Alignment
[3:21:01] <%spitelite> Jedi now sith later
[3:21:02] <CruxAustralis> it takes quite a few choices to move your alignment @PatStaresAt
[3:21:03] <+kawachipto> LUL shouldn't have been chaotic then LUL
[3:21:03] <%sw_paladin> You can do lawful stuff a bit
[3:21:04] <%newtype89> you whont swing to much from one or two choses
[3:21:06] <+kingdinkyI> Than don’t lie about it
[3:21:07] <+DragonArt07> one lawful choice won't change alignment
[3:21:08] <%laserbeaming> Yes, Dark Side Latter
[3:21:08] <$yeknomlive> you can do some lawful things it wont completely break you
[3:21:09] <Flagnalok> Neutral options aren't marked. Just go with the ones with no alignment.
[3:21:10] <+kingdinkyI> So what you want
[3:21:10] <+Vigonept> whos right ?
[3:21:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Burn an orphanage down to reset the scales
[3:21:25] <%Piemono> IMPORTANT CHOICE
[3:21:25] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt its accumulative, you can chose lawful options as a chaotic good charactrer
[3:21:26] <%laserbeaming> Lann is the better companion.
[3:21:27] <akitanito> ignore the DM's bf/gf
[3:21:29] <$lotharrio> Your powers won't fizzle from you telling the truth once.
[3:21:29] <%laserbeaming> Like way better
[3:21:29] <%HolePunchLeaf> why is the chaotic option to just lie?
[3:21:31] <+Shonen_hero> this is lann saying this is fine
[3:21:32] <+sonuke_draws> 2
[3:21:32] <%Ghufufin> dont be a bitch, alignment is bullshit
[3:21:35] <%JoshManVGH> You're I thibk you can only choose that because youre in range of the alignment.
[3:21:35] <%CatRidder> dont worry about picking some lawful things
[3:21:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chaos later
[3:21:40] <enreimirai> You can do whatever you want here.
[3:21:40] <CruxAustralis> DO IT
[3:21:43] <%Nekros4442> His plan is to bumrush a labyrinth with a bunch of untrained villagers. He's an idiot
[3:21:43] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you wont shift your alignment with a single choice
[3:21:45] <+BedHome> imho alignment only works as like, world lore, that there is alignment magic and people talk about it in character, instead of as absolute morality.  making alignment moral terms is stoopid gygax shit
[3:21:45] <%Sunriser41> lann is cooler, just saying
[3:21:45] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt they are colored, they're just the same color as the rest of the text
[3:21:46] <mikeriffic> CHOICES MUST BE MADE
[3:21:46] <%Nekros4442> Take chaos now
[3:21:47] <+kingdinkyI> Don’t worry about alignment
[3:21:47] <$lotharrio> That's why the alignment chart exists, it's a spectrum you can check after you do non-alignement stuff
[3:21:48] <CruxAustralis> lawful now chaos later
[3:21:51] <+DragonArt07> takes many choices to change alignment
[3:21:51] <+MisterAvry> CHAOS!
[3:21:51] <notsoy> you need to break alignment MANY times to cause problems
[3:21:51] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Do NOT worry about alignment, it's fine
[3:21:52] <%CatRidder> it requiers alot of points to change aliment
[3:21:53] <$mattynezz> Lann is MUCH stronger than Wendaug
[3:21:53] <+ALazo> whip it out pat
[3:21:53] <%PhysicsLB> do it, coward!
[3:21:54] <+Shonen_hero> This choice determines whether you get Lann or Wendu
[3:21:54] <%RealThiele> its not binary its like paragon/renegade the scale is slow
[3:21:54] <%strugglepunk2> @HolePunchLeaf Law chaos tends to be pretty dipshitted in this game
[3:21:55] <+kingdinkyI> Just do what you want
[3:21:55] <+Shonen_hero> btw
[3:21:57] <tanarath> Pat, ignore himbo, get spider
[3:21:57] <enreimirai> Lann is a good boi.
[3:21:59] <%Gogogolem> Pat it takes like 40 decesions to push you out of your alignment
[3:21:59] <+HawkeInitiative> Follow your beart!
[3:22:00] <DSD24> Wenduag is a cool spider cat lady
[3:22:00] <%newtype89> one off alinment choise whont kill you
[3:22:01] <akitanito> play what your character do
[3:22:02] <$yeknomlive> no
[3:22:03] <CruxAustralis> nope
[3:22:04] <ScrubTheNerd> No
[3:22:04] <enreimirai> You need to do a LOT of lawful to lose spells
[3:22:05] <StrayDogsStrut> nah, takes al ot to shift alignment
[3:22:05] <%Lefanque> The random lawful decision isn't going to matter
[3:22:05] <%HolePunchLeaf> nah
[3:22:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt lawful vs chaotic is a lot more lenient than good vs evil
[3:22:06] <lord_sykos> not from one choice
[3:22:08] <%Piemono> No once choice isn't going to affect that
[3:22:08] <Visorak6> Pat you'll be fine
[3:22:08] <DSD24> You just started Pat so no
[3:22:09] <+JJJKopf> no
[3:22:09] <enreimirai> a stupidly high number
[3:22:09] <%strugglepunk2> Nah it's a small adjustment
[3:22:09] <%laserbeaming> INQUISITORS DON'T CARE ABOUT ALIGNMENT
[3:22:09] <$lotharrio> Not from just this.
[3:22:10] <%newtype89> no
[3:22:10] <+Raspada_Ryner> These choices don't change your alignment that much
[3:22:11] <$mattynezz> After like 50 Lawful choices
[3:22:11] <%vaporousTippler> You get lots of chances to do alignment responses, so you can afford hits now and then.
[3:22:11] <+Speed1ines> It won't push your alignment very much
[3:22:12] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt it takes a lot of choices to lose the spells
[3:22:12] <Flagnalok> No you need to make alot of lawful choices to fall
[3:22:12] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you dont shift your alignment with a single off alignment choice, you wont lose spells
[3:22:12] <%Monkeyweed21> no
[3:22:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> nope
[3:22:12] <%Nekros4442> Why would you lose ur spells
[3:22:13] <%chance_h> Make the tougher decision and do the slightly less bad thing, you can always kill later
[3:22:13] <+DragonArt07> dont worry about it your alignment wont change
[3:22:14] <%CalderGaming> psaCrazy
[3:22:14] <+JJJKopf> One guy lied about that
[3:22:14] <%JoshManVGH> Only if your allignment changes drastically
[3:22:14] <@GeneralSCPatton> THIS IS A TINY NUDGE
[3:22:15] <%chiazam> You don’t HAVE to pick Chaos pat
[3:22:15] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  No its like 40 lawful things to lose spells.
[3:22:15] <%RealThiele> spussy or bowussy
[3:22:16] <$lotharrio> You gotta go SUPER lawful for that.
[3:22:17] <%Nekros4442> Ur Chaotic alignment in the first place
[3:22:18] <enreimirai> like 100 choices in a row
[3:22:18] <%CatRidder> NO
[3:22:21] <+Vigonept> naaaaag
[3:22:21] <+kingdinkyI> No
[3:22:21] <%chiazam> No
[3:22:22] <%Puhff> No, you would have to make SEVERAL Lawful choioces for that to happen
[3:22:22] <+DragonArt07> no
[3:22:23] <@Spydurman> takes more than this
[3:22:24] <sun312772> Being chaotic does not mean having a good or bad morale
[3:22:25] <+Vigonept> naaah
[3:22:26] <%strugglepunk2> check your character sheet after this
[3:22:27] <+Pendragwn> @Nekros4442 it's a mechanical thing
[3:22:27] <Blaven2> Pat, this is just one option that will have minimal effect. You can just do more Chaotic stuff down the road.
[3:22:28] <tanarath> Get the spussy
[3:22:28] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt if you ONLY choose lawful for a long time you might lose your spells eventually if you do NO chaotic
[3:22:31] <StrayDogsStrut> You have to do a LOT of lawful stuff
[3:22:32] <+kingdinkyI> You hav two make a bunch of lawful choices
[3:22:33] <%Gogogolem> you can pick the evil one later
[3:22:34] <%Piemono> Pat one Chioce on the Spectrum isn't going to fuck you alignment wise
[3:22:35] <$yeknomlive> this is like if a vegetarian ate jello once
[3:22:35] <%laserbeaming> Inquisitors don't lose spells for wrong alignment
[3:22:36] <%sw_paladin> There are scrolls that reset alignment anyway
[3:22:39] <$mattynezz> It takes like 50 choices to change alignment, you're fine
[3:22:40] <%Sunriser41> is gonna bump you like 1 pixel in the law direction
[3:22:42] <%athuramn> GOBLINS RUN WILD
[3:22:42] <cthulu_fearlock> psaElmo
[3:22:43] <%laserbeaming> you're not a cleric
[3:22:44] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt there are other mythic paths
[3:22:46] <%athuramn> FREE MY LITTLE DEMONS
[3:22:46] <enreimirai> Think of like in baldurs gate, where you got like, +1 alignment and it was like 50 to move ranks
[3:22:49] <+HawkeInitiative> SPUSSY
[3:22:50] <+kingdinkyI> You have to do it a bunch to make you change
[3:22:55] <%JoshManVGH> We're talking like Paladin committing murder for funsies type of actions to change alignments.
[3:22:57] <DSD24> Do you want Zen Archer man or Spider Fighter Lady
[3:22:58] <enreimirai> super class, dun worry yet.
[3:22:58] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt sticking to alignment is fine
[3:22:59] <%Puhff> it's not LUL
[3:23:00] <%newtype89> extra progression
[3:23:00] <CruxAustralis> it's an anime power up
[3:23:01] <Ika1> Itll make sense later
[3:23:02] <%BinaryFireball> its a path
[3:23:03] <+BigCoffee> Do what you want!
[3:23:05] <sun312772> Don't worry about it
[3:23:09] <+ShoggothLibrarian> You will not understand mythic paths for like two chapters, don't worry
[3:23:10] <%JoshManVGH> Mythic Paths are superpowers.
[3:23:11] <Visorak6> Mythic path sets you slowly towards a special crazy bullshit change
[3:23:11] <%Lefanque> then you can just respec
[3:23:12] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you wont
[3:23:13] <%laserbeaming> Inquisitors don't lose skills
[3:23:13] <%Puhff> Mythic Path is endgame shit
[3:23:13] <%athuramn> think of it as a global super
[3:23:14] <%alphonseisbest> thats FOR LATER
[3:23:14] <%Piemono> You Can just Respec anyway
[3:23:14] <%vaporousTippler> Just be a chaotic shit during meaningless dialogues.
[3:23:15] <+DragonArt07> don't worry about it
[3:23:15] <%cooldude69xx> You can take a different class later
[3:23:16] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt mythic is like a second class; most of them just buff you none of them are strictly the best
[3:23:16] <notsoy> you have to do a LOT of things to break alignment, don't worry about it
[3:23:17] <%HolePunchLeaf> i get why pat has paralysis about that, the game JUST TOLD HIM that mythic paths will lock you in, but this one choice won't
[3:23:18] <$lotharrio> Well there's respec
[3:23:19] <mikeriffic> You are on normal, youll be fine
[3:23:20] <+JJJKopf> you can respec later
[3:23:20] <%BinaryFireball> Pat when was the last time you HAVENT BEEN able to beat a game?
[3:23:20] <%Gogogolem> Oh don't worry
[3:23:21] <$mattynezz> You will have HUNDREDS of options for Chaotic options
[3:23:21] <enreimirai> If you want to do lawful, do it
[3:23:21] <%Ghufufin> then if its such a big deal respec your char later
[3:23:22] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt even if that happens theres an item that resets your alignment
[3:23:22] <%JoshManVGH> No
[3:23:23] <%Sunriser41> that is not gonna happen
[3:23:23] <+kawachipto> oh it's not like that
[3:23:24] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt you can just respec later
[3:23:24] <+BigCoffee> DONT WORRY
[3:23:25] <%laserbeaming> No you don't
[3:23:25] <+DragonArt07> you wont lose skills
[3:23:25] <%MugenSandan> NO
[3:23:25] <%Puhff> No, noe of that will happen dude
[3:23:25] <%BinaryFireball> they dont make games you cant beat anymore
[3:23:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Man who purports himself to be huge RPG fan is crippled by single decision in the early game
[3:23:26] <%RealThiele> no you wont
[3:23:26] <+Raspada_Ryner> One choice won't radically change your alignment
[3:23:26] <+kingdinkyI> Just do what you want to do
[3:23:27] <Visorak6> No
[3:23:27] <%alphonseisbest> YES, BUT U CAN RESET IT
[3:23:30] <%Nekros4442> Then take lawful and inquisitors dont give a shit not to mention there's a respec Pat
[3:23:30] <+Speed1ines> NO
[3:23:30] <%Ghufufin> no aliignment is bullshit
[3:23:31] <Scrub_Seeker> no
[3:23:33] <+boriss96> no
[3:23:33] <+DragonArt07> no
[3:23:34] <CruxAustralis> and you can reset alignment
[3:23:35] <%alphonseisbest> U CAN RESET IT
[3:23:36] <+kingdinkyI> Just respec
[3:23:37] <%BinaryFireball> FOLLOW YOUR HEART
[3:23:37] <DSD24> Only play how your chararacter would act
[3:23:37] <+EXPsoon> Don't worry , you can literally reset alignment with scrolls and stuff etc , @PatStaresAt
[3:23:37] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt a mythic path is a plot story that comes with loot and buffs etc  you do not have to keep in your alignment
[3:23:38] <%RealThiele> NO
[3:23:38] <enreimirai> Worst case you respec or use atonement scroll.
[3:23:39] <%sw_paladin> Scrolls can reset alignment Pst
[3:23:39] <%Sunriser41> alligment is prety lenient
[3:23:40] <tanarath> Also, some ideas are dumb & some ideas are smart. smart & dumb could have consequences, apparently?
[3:23:41] <CruxAustralis> take lawful
[3:23:42] <+kingdinkyI> No
[3:23:42] <+JJJKopf> don't worry, each choice moves the needle a teeny tiny bit
[3:23:42] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt You don't HAVE to, but check with your class anyway because you could lose stuff or it could be a requirement
[3:23:44] <masheshardest> pick what you want
[3:23:44] <%laserbeaming> Inquisitors don't care about alignment. They are given free reign by their deity
[3:23:44] <%JoshManVGH> Not perfectly, you have wiggle room
[3:23:44] <%Monkeyweed21> thats not how that works
[3:23:44] <%Reaviar> no, it takes a lot of choices to shift alignments
[3:23:45] <+emperri> why did you pick chaotic alignment if you want to save children
[3:23:45] <$lotharrio> For you, you have to be "not fully lawful" You can end up true neutral and still have your divine casting.
[3:23:46] <enreimirai> Respec it literally free.
[3:23:46] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt play the game with the choices you feel, theres items to reset alignment if you go too far one direction
[3:23:48] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Paladin is basically the only class that actually cares about alignment
[3:23:48] <$mattynezz> You can spend money to test your alignment layer, ITS FINE
[3:23:50] <%Gogogolem> You can respec to reset alignment to cheat it.
[3:23:51] <CruxAustralis> hell yeah
[3:23:52] <%hrbeck_> Alignment is so stupid
[3:23:52] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> moon2TYPERS
[3:23:57] <+Shonen_hero> Yeah most choices just slightly nudge you, you would have to make twenty lawful decisions before you'd become lawful good
[3:23:58] <+Vigonept> its like after a bunch of un alignment choices
[3:23:58] <+BedHome> @PatStaresAt you can completly reset or change shit about your character later for free
[3:24:00] <+kingdinkyI> You can literally just reapec
[3:24:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> alignment is a suggestion CHAOTIC doubly so
[3:24:02] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can go from chaotic to neutral and be fine, you have a lot of leeway
[3:24:06] <%Sunriser41> check on your character sheet to see how much that changed
[3:24:07] <%Ghufufin> ooooooh who gives a fuck
[3:24:08] <%Puhff> RUINED
[3:24:09] <+kawachipto> some late game items and other things need specific alignment, but you superrr far away
[3:24:10] <%newtype89> to an exstent so long as you remen N ,CG, CN,CE you will keep your spells
[3:24:11] <%athuramn> booooo, spider cat girl is your home girl
[3:24:12] <SolumFuturae> moon2TYPERS
[3:24:13] <tanarath> no spussy
[3:24:14] <%RealThiele> this is actually how alignment has fucked up dnd for so long
[3:24:15] <$lotharrio> Check your alignment after this to get an idea of how many times you can do it.
[3:24:17] <@Spydurman> game over
[3:24:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> chaotic people can be lawful sometimes
[3:24:24] <SolumFuturae> oof
[3:24:34] <%PlatinumAvacyn> @patstaresat your class doesn't lose spells for changing alignment. that's paladins
[3:24:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Nah I don't murder.
[3:24:40] <%RealThiele> angry cat spussy
[3:24:41] <+Vigonept> yeah but she sucks

[3:24:47] <+Shonen_hero> you killed them Patron, their irradiated blood is on your hands

[3:26:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> You started in the middle of the CG pie.
[3:26:26] <$mattynezz> It does, you can't see it
[3:26:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> it started like 2 pixels to the right
[3:26:28] <Ika1> it will move and leave traces
[3:26:29] <%Lefanque> it started basically where you're at
[3:26:29] <%Gogogolem> yes
[3:26:30] <%chance_h> It leaves a trail from where it moved
[3:26:30] <%PlatinumAvacyn> it started there.

[3:27:09] <%JoshManVGH> A complete rest will cure you
[3:27:09] <enreimirai> it is "permanent" in that it doesnt wear off on its own.
[3:27:10] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> I love you Pat but you need to red
[3:27:10] <+ALazo> Being permanently tired seems normal
[3:27:11] <$lotharrio> As in does not go away with "just" time.
[3:27:11] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> read
[3:27:11] <%Puhff> no, that just means it doesn't have a timer
[3:27:13] <%TheFabledAble> read it before you freak out dude
[3:27:13] <%Lefanque> pat it DOES show you movement on your alignment chart, you just moved to little that it doesn't show up
[3:27:13] <+MisterAvry> gotta sleep
[3:27:14] <+Pendragwn> @joodatious in canon it's literally the gods KEKW
[3:27:15] <ScrubTheNerd> "Premanent" just means the status won't go away over time
[3:27:15] <tanarath> N O
[3:27:15] <%Nekros4442> Read it pat
[3:27:15] <+Vigonept> Read more pat
[3:27:16] <%chance_h> Your sleepy pat
[3:27:17] <%JoshManVGH> You need sleep
[3:27:17] <%athuramn> all because you made one lawful act, nice going
[3:27:18] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> read the whole thing
[3:27:20] <chaosbringer28> basically just means no timer is attached to it
[3:27:22] <+Squidbit> because it doesn't expire
[3:27:24] <CruxAustralis> because it doesn't go away
[3:27:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Permanent means no timer.
[3:27:24] <%Agami23> because it doesent have a timer
[3:27:24] <@GeneralSCPatton> NO TIMER
[3:27:24] <%chiazam> Need to rest
[3:27:25] <notsoy> permanent until you rest, it won't go away over time
[3:27:25] <enreimirai> it just lacks a time factor
[3:27:25] <%Ghufufin> no timer
[3:27:25] <+Speed1ines> IT JUST MEANS IT'S NOT ON A TIMER
[3:27:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> because there isn't a timer on it
[3:27:26] <%LeiaSkynoober> Until you rest lol
[3:27:26] <@Ranryu692> because it doesn't wear off
[3:27:26] <%TheFabledAble> its permanent until rest
[3:27:27] <CruxAustralis> until you rest
[3:27:27] <MidnightPacif1c> FeelsPermanentlyFatiguedMan
[3:27:27] <%laserbeaming> It's permanent because it has infinite duration
[3:27:27] <%Sunriser41> because there is no timer to go away
[3:27:28] <%BinaryFireball> permenant until you rest
[3:27:28] <$lotharrio> As in "no timer"
[3:27:28] <dan_g_v> when was the last time you slept?
[3:27:29] <+kingdinkyI> Pat literally read it
[3:27:29] <%athuramn> your lawfulness made you tired
[3:27:29] <$mattynezz> Because it doesn't wear off
[3:27:29] <%Nekros4442> Cus it doesnt expire
[3:27:29] <%PlatinumAvacyn> not timed
[3:27:30] <%JoshManVGH> Because you cant dispell it
[3:27:30] <tanarath> Read, ginger!
[3:27:31] <+JustToWatch> because it won't go away unless you rest
[3:27:32] <+DeadPhoenix3> because tis not based on time
[3:27:33] <%YakumoYomi> Permanent vs. lasts a certain amount of terms
[3:27:33] <%Puhff> no timer
[3:27:33] <+JJJKopf> that just means no timetable
[3:27:34] <akitanito> wording issues
[3:27:35] <joodatious> @joodatious canon or not doesn't make it suck less
[3:27:35] <Visorak6> Permanent means you need something to get rid of it, it has no expiration @PatStaresAt
[3:27:35] <%strakillias> until rest Pat. Its not like real life where you stay tired forever BibleThump
[3:27:36] <%bread_assassin> Because it won't wear off on its own.
[3:27:36] <%Sotetsu> Permanent just means it doesn't go away on its own.
[3:27:36] <+DragonArt07> no duration
[3:27:36] <chaosbringer28> because its not on a timer
[3:27:37] <%Valdorick> Permanent doesn't mean its uncurable, just that it has no duration.
[3:27:38] <SolumFuturae> The descriptors in this game are super obtuse, a lot of it is copy past from the rulebooks.
[3:27:38] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz you cant wait it out dummy
[3:27:39] <%LilyaFatal> Permanent until rest
[3:27:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah pretty much.
[3:27:41] <%chiazam> No timer
[3:27:41] <CruxAustralis> yes LUL
[3:27:42] <%Sunriser41> yea, probably
[3:27:43] <%HolePunchLeaf> it really should just say until rest, yeah
[3:27:44] <%Gogogolem> yes
[3:27:44] <%sandrews> weird wordings here
[3:27:45] <+Vigonept> permanent means no timers
[3:27:45] <%Ghufufin> yes
[3:27:45] <Gorshum> Yup.
[3:27:46] <%CatRidder> PAT OPEN BIOGRAPHY TO CHECK YOU DECIONS
[3:27:46] <lord_sykos> yeah pretty much
[3:27:47] <meteor530> I'm just as lost as you are
[3:27:47] <CruxAustralis> I mean you are just being Pat
[3:27:48] <%Puhff> yes
[3:27:48] <enreimirai> it is VERY pathfinder terminology
[3:27:48] <joodatious> no pat DND is more clear this is pathfinder nonesense
[3:27:49] <%RealThiele> should just say  "until rest"
[3:27:49] <tanarath> Permanent till rest
[3:27:49] <StrayDogsStrut> You hit the nail on the head, as a DM of like, 10 years.
[3:27:53] <+kingdinkyI> Because there is a timer
[3:27:54] <%Piemono> Everything I learned about PF I learned from these games
[3:27:54] <Jimhalla> that's true, yeah
[3:27:54] <%Broand> I feel like if you saw these terms in KOTOR you'd not have nearly as many qualms
[3:27:55] <%vaporousTippler> You don't just stay awake until not tired anymore.
[3:27:55] <+Vigonept> The wording sucks yeah i hate it
[3:27:55] <+MisterAvry> That's fair
[3:27:55] <%athuramn> Not a wrong assumption
[3:27:55] <UnImprest> Woolie is wearing a Pat skin and took over
[3:27:55] <%Agami23> no, the game just is bad at words
[3:27:56] <Flagnalok> You can technically play without sleeping
[3:27:57] <%laserbeaming> it just means it has infinite duration
[3:27:57] <%newtype89> just wait till she hees permanet negativ LVs lol
[3:27:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's a lot of D&D terminology used here with no explanation given for it because they assume you know.
[3:27:58] <%sandrews> i agree with pat on this
[3:27:59] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Removed on rest
[3:28:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> but then it explicitly tells you how to fix it
[3:28:02] <Owlboy7> is not that complicated
[3:28:06] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i never played D&D and i still understood that one
[3:28:07] <T_Sasquatch> Stop THINKING
[3:28:08] <akitanito> is it a dnd terminology? I thought this is just for this game
[3:28:09] <%hrbeck_> Pathfinder uses shit verbage
[3:28:09] <MrGuy516> this game just assumes that you know how to play D&D already.
[3:28:10] <%Puhff> That's not DnD; that's Owlcat
[3:28:10] <mosus_nommaz> its only permanent until you heal it
[3:28:10] <%linSP> tfw my sebille got permanent wet status
[3:28:11] <joodatious> this is NOT DND rules
[3:28:12] <%Ghufufin> totally this game is very opaque without a lot of guide research or game exp
[3:28:13] <%chiazam> I don’t think that
[3:28:13] <notsoy> you picked chaotic good originally
[3:28:14] <%sandrews> exist
[3:28:15] <Visorak6> YOu made the character
[3:28:15] <%Piemono> You chose CG
[3:28:15] <enreimirai> revealed light of heaven
[3:28:15] <+transporterthesequel> You existed
[3:28:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Created your character.
[3:28:15] <lord_sykos> you made the character
[3:28:16] <%TheFabledAble> character creatyion
[3:28:16] <DSD24> That's the start
[3:28:17] <%newtype89> you started CG
[3:28:17] <+BigCoffee> STOP THINKING
[3:28:18] <%laserbeaming> that's the starting alignment
[3:28:19] <$mattynezz> You stated the game
[3:28:19] <%animaturgy> Thats weird video game icons
[3:28:20] <%Nekros4442> Thats where you started
[3:28:20] <%TheDullaMAN> It says right there
[3:28:20] <CruxAustralis> created the character KEKW
[3:28:21] <%Sunriser41> character creation
[3:28:21] <%bread_assassin> You selected it.
[3:28:21] <%JoshManVGH> You where born
[3:28:21] <+JJJKopf> it started there
[3:28:22] <meteor530> You ate a sandwich
[3:28:23] <+ShoggothLibrarian> You STARTED Chaotic Good
[3:28:23] <%BinaryFireball> You cant control the numbers
[3:28:24] <%Puhff> dude...
[3:28:25] <gaelic_otaku> Pathfinder is 3.5 which from my understanding is very wordy unlike current 5e which isn't bad neccessarily
[3:28:26] <chaosbringer28> char creation
[3:28:29] <%RealThiele> born
[3:28:31] <Shwepie> Permanent is a bad term in this case. Pat's Right.
[3:28:33] <+Vigonept> you chose your god
[3:28:38] <%JoshManVGH> Whats your gods allignment?
[3:28:39] <+kingdinkyI> You started chaotic good
[3:28:40] <%athuramn> @meteor530 chrono trigger reference o: ?
[3:28:40] <%TheFabledAble> you turned it off yea
[3:28:41] <Visorak6> It auto-picks
[3:28:41] <%newtype89> just hit next
[3:28:43] <%vaporousTippler> There are default choices highlighted. That's auto level.
[3:28:43] <meteor530> Just look harder
[3:28:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt I have very little experience with D & D and this is all pretty well explained
[3:28:48] <+RedMaskBandit> pat your alignment is based off of how you built your character. in this instance your dwarf is chaotic good as you play your character their choices changes the overall alignment and because its on a wheel rather than a regular "good bad" chart
[3:28:48] <%Sunriser41> click next
[3:28:50] <tanarath> Ongoing would be a better way to say it, DnD uses weird terminology.
[3:28:50] <+Shonen_hero> you turned it off
[3:28:51] <%laserbeaming> time for CHOICES
[3:28:56] <+Pendragwn> For animal companions
[3:28:57] <CruxAustralis> next
[3:28:58] <+Shonen_hero> wait click next
[3:29:00] <+ShoggothLibrarian> It's in difficulty options
[3:29:00] <+DragonArt07> go to options
[3:29:02] <+transporterthesequel> For your companions there is, and you can turn it on for yourself, but if you turn it off, it's ALWAYS off, forever.
[3:29:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat pls.
[3:29:05] <Visorak6> Just keep hitting next it has pre-selected stuff unless you tamper with it @PatStaresAt
[3:29:07] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt YOu can turn it back on btw.
[3:29:08] <+RedMaskBandit> in options there should be an option for auto level
[3:29:11] <%BinaryFireball> is this poopy kryptonite?
[3:29:12] <+DragonArt07> its in difficulty options
[3:29:13] <gyde42> Your mistake was playing Pathfinder imo
[3:29:15] <+kingdinkyI> Just click next and it will just do it for you
[3:29:17] <%newtype89> hit the dubble arrows at the buttom
[3:29:20] <%RealThiele> lay on hands oh yeahhh
[3:29:21] <%athuramn> Chat strikes again !
[3:29:21] <joodatious> is pathfinder actually like this because this makes pathfinder look annoying as hell
[3:29:22] <+DragonArt07> false
[3:29:27] <%chance_h> You can always change the difficulty
[3:29:28] <%Nekros4442> It's not off forever
[3:29:37] <%JoshManVGH> What alignment is your god?
[3:29:38] <Owlboy7> auto level? that's some casual shit WutFace
[3:29:39] <%Nekros4442> ffs you can just change it on the difficulty screen
[3:29:39] <$lotharrio> Oh there are double arrows
[3:29:40] <%newtype89> oh you turned it off didint you
[3:29:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> Turn it on in difficulty options.
[3:29:42] <StrayDogsStrut> @joodatious Yes, Pathfinder 1e and D&D 3.5e are like this.
[3:29:43] <Calek> @joodatious it's a very crunchy system
[3:29:43] <D_Eye2> It's in options
[3:29:44] <gyde42> @joodatious Pathfinder is really like this
[3:29:44] <$mattynezz> Options
[3:29:45] <%hrbeck_> Pathfinder is annoying
[3:29:46] <%Sunriser41> look at the option in dificulty
[3:29:48] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt its under game settings
[3:29:48] <+DragonArt07> go to options difficulty
[3:29:49] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt Go to the difficulty options
[3:29:49] <+Shonen_hero> Just go to your difficulty options
[3:29:57] <%cooldude69xx> @joodatious When a human being is explaining it, the system makes more sense.
[3:29:57] <%RealThiele> in hard options
[3:29:59] <joodatious> fuuckk
[3:30:01] <$mattynezz> Go to Options and go to the difficulty tab
[3:30:01] <+Pendragwn> @joodatious It's tabletop you can do all this shit before playing, doing it while playing sucks nards
[3:30:02] <Samuy_JP> options -> difficulty
[3:30:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Options menu.
[3:30:03] <%Piemono> Under Options
[3:30:05] <+DragonArt07> options
[3:30:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Difficulty.
[3:30:10] <+kingdinkyI> It’s in difficultly
[3:30:12] <+xenoboost> pathfinder is not good for your goblins
[3:30:13] <%newtype89> yes
[3:30:14] <%Piemono> Yes
[3:30:14] <%laserbeaming> yes you can
[3:30:16] <$mattynezz> Yeah
[3:30:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah of course you can.
[3:30:17] <+transporterthesequel> YES
[3:30:17] <Brofarian> Pathfinder is for crazy people and mathletes, no one else.
[3:30:18] <enreimirai> you can change it whenever you want
[3:30:19] <%Nekros4442> yes
[3:30:21] <+JJJKopf> yees
[3:30:22] <+transporterthesequel> You can even do it per encounter
[3:30:23] <gyde42> @joodatious DnD 5e is so much better
[3:30:26] <chaosbringer28> yes
[3:30:26] <joodatious> I've played other tabletop rulesets but this looks awful
[3:30:30] <enreimirai> pathfinder is hyper crunchy
[3:30:32] <%AyotoCorp> You can change the difficulty mid-COMBAT if you want
[3:30:34] <%Nekros4442> You have auto level back on now so ur good
[3:30:36] <%athuramn> yeah, this game's very flexible
[3:30:38] <+DeadPhoenix3> 5e sucks
[3:30:41] <%RealThiele> story mode is now unlocked
[3:30:42] <%Giantsuperguy> Pathfinder is crunchy but fun
[3:30:45] <+kingdinkyI> Look now it’s on
[3:30:45] <+Shonen_hero> all the stuff is all selected for you
[3:30:49] <%Sunriser41> pathfinder is a mess, but a fun mess
[3:30:59] <enreimirai> pathfinder is super crunchy and rules-heavy. If that is what you like its great. If you prefer rules light, 5E is better
[3:31:02] <+JJJKopf> so it still SHOWS it
[3:31:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah I'd recommend leaving autolevel on for your first run.
[3:31:04] <joodatious> just play 5e homebrew
[3:31:04] <%HolePunchLeaf> pathfinder is actually good and fluid and fun, but this game is a little awkward
[3:31:04] <%athuramn> ikr, one that asks for your opinion
[3:31:11] <sirrice77> @joodatious It's not, it just has literally a billion options because people keep making more.
[3:31:15] <CruxAustralis> nah 5e sucks
[3:31:20] <%laserbeaming> 5E does suck ass
[3:31:21] <CruxAustralis> Pathfinder is much better than 5e
[3:31:22] <CruxAustralis> even PF1
[3:31:23] <akitanito> so rather than auto-level it's more of a recommend huh
[3:31:24] <%Gogogolem> lay on these hadns
[3:31:27] <%athuramn> lay hands on deez nu-
[3:31:28] <+JJJKopf> games have advanced over the past 15 years
[3:31:28] <+Fidranth> isn't pathfinder just 3.5e or is that too simplisitic?
[3:31:30] <Madinki> Hmmm, yeah I dunno this makes Pathfinder look like a fucking annoying mess
[3:31:34] <+xenoboost> since i think this game is still working off 1st edition rules and creation you can actually make a an actual bad character
[3:31:34] <$yeknomlive> i turned autolevel off immediately. didnt know you could you alter it if you dont like what they pick
[3:31:35] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:31:37] <CruxAustralis> NO
[3:31:38] <+transporterthesequel> Hmm yes PLUS 13 TRICKERY HOLY SHIT
[3:31:39] <CruxAustralis> CHANGE HER HEX
[3:31:40] <+Shonen_hero> it beefs her armor
[3:31:42] <CruxAustralis> PICK EVIL EYE
[3:31:44] <CruxAustralis> welp too late
[3:31:45] <$mattynezz> 5e is good for new players, but not much else
[3:31:47] <%cooldude69xx> @joodatious And again, without a human to show you the ropes a lot of shit is unclear
[3:31:49] <+kingdinkyI> Yeah just use recommended
[3:31:51] <$lotharrio> Bah. Iceplant is fine.
[3:31:52] <%Sunriser41> 5e is simpler and better for begginers, but thats kinda it, is a bit bland
[3:31:57] <+Shonen_hero> Crux just chill man
[3:32:00] <CruxAustralis> Iceplant is okay
[3:32:10] <CruxAustralis> but if Camelia is getting hit something went wrong already LUL
[3:32:12] <+ShoggothLibrarian> You don't want to do Evil Eye -> Cackle on Camellia, she's melee
[3:32:15] <Brofarian> @Fidranth Pathfinder is 3.5 plus like a hundred bullshit add ons
[3:32:16] <joodatious> @Sunriser41 thats why you put in some homebrew
[3:32:21] <CruxAustralis> it's not the worse
[3:32:22] <@GeneralSCPatton> Slumber Hex best Hex. Coup de Grace for days woolieGASM
[3:32:27] <CruxAustralis> Evil Eye is so absurdly strong
[3:32:37] <CruxAustralis> Evil Eye + Sleep = ez Coup de Grace
[3:32:42] <joodatious> you don't need mechanics on top of mechanics for fun. there's no creativity in this
[3:32:42] <%cooldude69xx> @Sunriser41 Homebrew is just admitting theres a problem to be fixed
[3:32:46] <+Shonen_hero> you gotta do your own leveling
[3:32:48] <joodatious> just spreadsheets
[3:32:49] <CruxAustralis> also -2 to AC is very very good
[3:32:51] <$mattynezz> Later character is better for Evil Eye and Slumber.
[3:33:01] <Calek> be persuasive about jesus
[3:33:06] <%RealThiele> boom wis is now your dex and cha
[3:33:18] <%laserbeaming> Divine Favor's good
[3:33:19] <RatloreTheIdiot> these level ups give me fucking anxiety
[3:33:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> If you become persuasive enough you can do a super cool and religious thing.
[3:33:19] <Visorak6> Divine favor is solid
[3:33:20] <CruxAustralis> also you don't get a magical or even cold iron rapier until later so her melee is kinda useless even with her magic buff
[3:33:21] <$mattynezz> Evil Eye + Cackle is where it's at
[3:33:22] <CruxAustralis> it's like
[3:33:22] <%cooldude69xx> Divine Favor is good choice
[3:33:24] <CruxAustralis> 1 damage
[3:33:27] <joodatious> Pathfinder is for people who dont like roleplaying
[3:33:30] <+JJJKopf> after this hit B to bring up your spellbook at set things up before rest
[3:33:40] <%laserbeaming> there's a tent where you can rest
[3:33:40] <CruxAustralis> so it's better to Evil Eye someone so Seelah or someone else can hit
[3:33:42] <+Shonen_hero> true strike's a good one too, when you have the option to pick another level one. True Strike let's you get a +20 to attack for one attack
[3:33:43] <Flagnalok> Camellia might have more spell slots in her book
[3:33:47] <+DragonArt07> theres a tent where you can rest
[3:33:47] <%laserbeaming> 1 is Temporary HP
[3:33:48] <%Piemono> That is Temp health
[3:33:49] <notsoy> the bonus HP from the light spell
[3:33:51] <+transporterthesequel> +1 means a buff
[3:33:51] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt change your spellbook before you rest
[3:33:51] <$SGrim> 1 means 1
[3:33:52] <+BigCoffee> VISUAL BUF
[3:33:52] <Rotharn> Temp health
[3:33:52] <%cooldude69xx> @joodatious What stops roleplaying here?
[3:33:52] <enreimirai> you have 1 temp HP
[3:33:52] <$lotharrio> Temporary HP bonus
[3:33:54] <$mattynezz> Temp HP from Angel Sword
[3:33:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> They get 1 bonus HP from your angel powers.
[3:33:55] <+JJJKopf> your light
[3:33:55] <enreimirai> your light
[3:33:56] <%Giantsuperguy> @joodatious Pathfinder is no worse for roleplaying than 5e is
[3:33:57] <Jimhalla> Temp HP
[3:33:58] <+kingdinkyI> Spell book before you rest
[3:33:58] <+DragonArt07> from angel power
[3:33:59] <%laserbeaming> because of your Light
[3:33:59] <+ShoggothLibrarian> You have 1 temporary HP from your Light of the Angel thing
[3:33:59] <%Piemono> Your angel ability
[3:33:59] <%Nekros4442> Thats the temporary health from ur angel light
[3:34:00] <Rotharn> Your angel AoE
[3:34:00] <enreimirai> your light gives 1
[3:34:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> Angel light.
[3:34:00] <chaosbringer28> bonus hp from your ability
[3:34:01] <Scrub_Seeker> the +1 is the temporary hitpoint from your light of the heavens ability
[3:34:02] <%Ghufufin> or pathfinder is for people who can do simple math and like roleplaying
[3:34:05] <$mattynezz> Angel Sword gives buff
[3:34:08] <%Monkeyweed21> temp HP from your angle
[3:34:09] <%JoshManVGH> What was Pat's god of choice?
[3:34:09] <%RealThiele> angel power hp
[3:34:11] <$lotharrio> Cause of Jesus
[3:34:13] <chaosbringer28> your angel ability
[3:34:14] <+Shonen_hero> cause your red bull
[3:34:17] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt always assume it's some bullshit
[3:34:18] <tanarath> Temp hp from the light
[3:34:19] <+transporterthesequel> God this is such a good crunchy ass game
[3:34:19] <+Shonen_hero> and you give them wings
[3:34:26] <joodatious> jeemzus
[3:34:37] <Rotharn> Edible Moss Kreygasm
[3:34:41] <+Pendragwn> Chat can I multiclass
[3:34:45] <%chiazam> Steal time
[3:34:48] <CruxAustralis> yes
[3:34:55] <%RealThiele> looked like multiclass was there
[3:35:00] <+Shonen_hero> yeah and then shake that man down for money
[3:35:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> These people suck. You should burn their village down.
[3:35:06] <CruxAustralis> you can deffo multiclass
[3:35:06] <%alphonseisbest> SO IF U WANTED TO MAKE a Dark knight type character what class would u use chat?
[3:35:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> Multiclass is indeed in this game.
[3:35:12] <%PlatinumAvacyn> @patstaresat set up spellbooks before resting
[3:35:14] <%newtype89> he didint spone yet
[3:35:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> So is prestige classes.
[3:35:22] <Calek> @Pendragwn you can but I will call the police
[3:35:28] <bigben01> Oh shit is that Horgus Gwerm?
[3:35:32] <%JoshManVGH> If you want to prestige class, multiclass like your life depends on it
[3:35:34] <%cooldude69xx> @alphonseisbest What is a dark knight?
[3:35:38] <%Giantsuperguy> @alphonseisbest Depends on what you want it to be, hellknight could work
[3:35:39] <+DeadPhoenix3> depends on what you want from a dark knight class
[3:35:39] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Oh, Gwerm?
[3:35:42] <+Shonen_hero> What was that about Cam? Hmmm?
[3:35:52] <%Ghufufin> @alphonseisbest  depends on what you mean by darkknight prob edgy paladin or warpriest
[3:36:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Horgus Gwerm seems like a good guy.
[3:36:04] <Rotharn> Horgus Gwerm feels like a normal name being mispronounced
[3:36:06] <CruxAustralis> to make DRK I'd go with Paladin into Hellknight eventually
[3:36:11] <CruxAustralis> but Warpriest is good too
[3:36:15] <+Vigonept> based gwerm
[3:36:31] <+Shonen_hero> shaking him down for money does not effect your alignment
[3:36:33] <$mattynezz> LUL
[3:36:35] <+Shonen_hero> damn
[3:36:38] <+transporterthesequel> You did
[3:36:42] <%JoshManVGH> I think there are melee aspected Warlock archetypes that can be built to DRK
[3:36:42] <chaosbringer28> rip
[3:36:47] <+xenoboost> that is a beauty of pathfinder is those archtypes
[3:36:50] <%PlatinumAvacyn> @patstaresat set up spellbooks before resting
[3:36:50] <%redthebaron> let's not be miserly i say being miserly
[3:36:53] <%TheFabledAble> you miss 100% of the begging for moneys you dont take
[3:36:58] <+transporterthesequel> DO IT FOR GWERM
[3:36:59] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt open your spellbook before resting
[3:36:59] <%alphonseisbest> @alphonseisbest see i saw that but there like pure order right? im trying to find something more like Vigilante style knight
[3:37:02] <+Shonen_hero> these names are so goofy
[3:37:05] <+Shonen_hero> I fucking love it
[3:37:05] <CruxAustralis> you gotta set the new spells
[3:37:06] <%laserbeaming> not a lot of people just have 1000 gp lying around
[3:37:07] <+JustToWatch> what's that guy's name again?
[3:37:17] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Wait, Holy shit IS that THE Horgus Gwerm?
[3:37:22] <rasamune> You do it for Gwerm, that is to say, you do it for gwim
[3:37:22] <%Questiy> Bloodrager is also a good pick for DRK, being a magic berserker
[3:37:28] <+DeadPhoenix3> black blade magus could probably do dark knight
[3:37:34] <%alphonseisbest> @alphonseisbest think more FF dark knight
[3:37:35] <+DeadPhoenix3> idk if that is in thsi game though
[3:37:36] <%logoth_> Edge Maverock
[3:37:43] <%cooldude69xx> @lewd_sister_of_battle Horgus Gwerm? The Very same?
[3:37:45] <%laserbeaming> yeah, prepare spells for Camellia
[3:37:58] <enreimirai> hey
[3:38:00] <enreimirai> hey pat
[3:38:00] <%laserbeaming> it does run like shit
[3:38:04] <%deviljhojho_> its not ideal
[3:38:06] <%alphonseisbest> @Ghufufin could they work for FF style Dark knight class?
[3:38:06] <enreimirai> i recommend the cleaner mod
[3:38:08] <+Shonen_hero> jank
[3:38:09] <SolumFuturae> yep
[3:38:09] <+DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt turn off the shadows may help
[3:38:10] <enreimirai> cause the saves get fat
[3:38:12] <+JJJKopf> the power of unity
[3:38:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> It do be like that.
[3:38:17] <%laserbeaming> Do it for Camellia.
[3:38:17] <Badgerconda_> You're surprised that something that came out of Russia barely works?
[3:38:18] <enreimirai> the saves get VERY, VERY, VERY fat
[3:38:19] <%TheFabledAble> go to companions spells
[3:38:20] <+Vigonept> is it still in beta?
[3:38:23] <CruxAustralis> Camelia's
[3:38:24] <%vaporousTippler> It runs like shit, but at least it runs.
[3:38:24] <%PlatinumAvacyn> cammi
[3:38:26] <$mattynezz> Camellia
[3:38:26] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah the Shadows freakin HOG for some reason.
[3:38:27] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @PatStaresAt Thanks for playing Grime, I tried a Demon and loved it, but wouldn't have known about it if you didn't play it. Love it so far, beat the 1st boss in my 1st try!
[3:38:29] <enreimirai> like whatever you are thinking of for "big save file" is tiny.
[3:38:32] <UnsteadyFunk> I'm so glad these people don't mind strangers running around the camp and stealing all their stuff
[3:38:32] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt some companions memorize spells via slots
[3:38:33] <%laserbeaming> you can prepare one spell
[3:38:37] <%alphonseisbest> @Vigonept nope full release
[3:38:37] <%Sunriser41> yea, i love the game but it runs like shit
[3:38:38] <$mattynezz> there's empty slot
[3:38:38] <CruxAustralis> Put one in the empty slot
[3:38:39] <+xenoboost> i have heard that both pathfinder games are pretty jank
[3:38:43] <%laserbeaming> she's got Vancian MAgic
[3:38:45] <%Sotetsu> I haven't had any problems running it, I didn't know people were having issues. I hope they fix it.
[3:38:46] <%vaporousTippler> My favorite is coup de grace causing several seconds of lag while the computer does a bunch of math.
[3:38:47] <chaosbringer28> empty spell slot
[3:38:48] <enreimirai> just double click spell
[3:38:49] <%PlatinumAvacyn> you have to prepare spells in slots
[3:38:53] <%laserbeaming> that spell is Spirit Only
[3:38:53] <%CatRidder> she has an open slot
[3:38:55] <$mattynezz> Yellow only goes in the yellow box
[3:38:59] <%laserbeaming> can only be prepared on that slot
[3:38:59] <+JJJKopf> she has a slot open
[3:39:01] <CruxAustralis> drag one to the empty slot
[3:39:03] <%alphonseisbest> @JJJKopf this was built in unity?! no way!
[3:39:06] <+Vigonept> @alphonseisbest  fuck
[3:39:07] <enreimirai> spirit magic slots can only hold specific spells
[3:39:09] <+transporterthesequel> Like this is a PROPER ASS Crunchy Roleplaying game.
[3:39:10] <CruxAustralis> that's her domain spell basically
[3:39:11] <%Gogogolem> Prepaired spells
[3:39:12] <Rotharn> It's a shaman thing, she's got a Spirit Magic slot
[3:39:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yellow slot Pat.
[3:39:12] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt enlarge person is given special to that spot because of her talents giving it to her
[3:39:12] <Badgerconda_> it can only go in that one slot
[3:39:17] <wingedsword> At least its running better than Kingmaker did at launch.
[3:39:17] <+DragonArt07> drag and drop
[3:39:18] <$mattynezz> Part of her class, it's a bonus spell
[3:39:19] <$lotharrio> Summons aren't bad.
[3:39:20] <chaosbringer28> its a class spell, tied to shamen
[3:39:22] <CruxAustralis> the solo one is one she gets for free basically
[3:39:25] <wingedsword> Oh boy.
[3:39:25] <%PlatinumAvacyn> bonus spell slot from subclass
[3:39:27] <CruxAustralis> I recommend SUmmon
[3:39:28] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt double click to fill a slot with that spell
[3:39:36] <+transporterthesequel> Nigh impenetrable, runs like shit, but has 19 trillion options and rando bugs
[3:39:40] <CruxAustralis> Burning Hands is not bad either
[3:39:42] <%Valdorick> Good ole burning hands!
[3:39:45] <%CatRidder> BLESS
[3:39:46] <%newtype89> till you burn your friends lol
[3:39:56] <Rotharn> don't touch your eye with burning hands
[3:39:57] <%Ghufufin> @alphonseisbest not super sure what DK does in FF, but a  Pally or WP good for hitty with sword, can heal self and cast buff spells on self to varying degrees. Pally more uppity alignment and sword hitty, Wartpriest more buffy and spells
[3:39:59] <+DragonArt07> too many quick saves
[3:40:04] <%Afterman_> what class did pat pick
[3:40:07] <%Valdorick> Bless deez nutz
[3:40:15] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Inquisitor
[3:40:23] <Zakaraz> does pat maybe need to look at character creation for the TTRPG? i feel like that might clear up some confusion
[3:40:24] <+Shonen_hero> inquisitor
[3:40:35] <%Monkeyweed21> yummu
[3:40:37] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt By the way, after the stream, spoil yourself on Mythic Paths, and drown in the minor panic attack before being addicted for good.
[3:40:40] <+DragonArt07> you can retrain soon
[3:40:50] <%alphonseisbest> @Ghufufin their more about life drain, and using their hp to boost attack. there anything like that in PF?
[3:40:55] <enreimirai> inquisitor is kinda like a more combat-focused bard
[3:40:58] <@Ranryu692> welcome to D&D
[3:40:58] <+BigCoffee> it's normal the game isnt hard
[3:41:00] <%cooldude69xx> @Zakaraz This game should have a clearer direction in that regard itself
[3:41:00] <+JJJKopf> right after this
[3:41:00] <enreimirai> divine, combat focused bard
[3:41:02] <%Gogogolem> you're about to unlock it
[3:41:03] <+BigCoffee> you can auto attack half of the dungeon
[3:41:05] <Rotharn> the power progression is a very slow burn
[3:41:06] <Visorak6> You can play pretty fast and loose in this dungeon
[3:41:08] <%Nekros4442> That's DnD
[3:41:08] <%Valdorick> Welcome to vancian casting.
[3:41:09] <+transporterthesequel> This is the tutorial, so you kinda won't for a bit.
[3:41:11] <%laserbeaming> after this you'll be able to rest anytime. The corruption mechanic doesn't kick in until after the next dungeon
[3:41:17] <+transporterthesequel> When you get to a hard encounter, you'll KNOW
[3:41:28] <%newtype89> you can start resting on your on once you hit thre maze
[3:41:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt thats most classes until you unlearn that mind goblin
[3:41:33] <+Shonen_hero> the purple marker on the map is a rest stop
[3:41:40] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt Could also just save a bunch and when you get killed then you know when to use a spell
[3:41:40] <%Piemono> That's what quick saves are for
[3:41:44] <+BigCoffee> Don't worry
[3:41:45] <%Fooguwu> Pat isn't built for DnD psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:41:45] <%AyotoCorp> Quicksave all the time
[3:41:45] <%newtype89> nope
[3:41:51] <%Agami23> why not cast it IN the fight?
[3:41:52] <%Nekros4442> That's what quicksaves are for
[3:41:53] <%Questiy> The game will warn you of tough fights
[3:41:54] <%MidnightBurst12> it will be fine
[3:41:55] <+BigCoffee> its easy until you exit the shield maze
[3:41:58] <$StrawberryPantsu> Bless? The rapper?
[3:42:01] <chowndawg> when you die you will know
[3:42:03] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt 90% of your allies have spellcasting, so add some redundancy to your spells so you can recast spells like bless over a whole day
[3:42:03] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Or just cast bless when combat has started...what?
[3:42:04] <joodatious> this is why you should be able to zoom out more
[3:42:09] <%Giantsuperguy> @alphonseisbest Well what comes to mind for me would be abyssal bloodline bloodrager. Bloodragers are basically sorcerer barbarians, but the steelblood archetype lets them wear heavy armor. abyssal bloodline gives them some demon powers, sorta like how dark knights use darkness to fight evil
[3:42:10] <+Vigonept> casting in the fight takes a turn tho
[3:42:12] <%athuramn> @patstaresat you have a difficulty option to pause before melee combat.  to what extent, I dunno
[3:42:18] <%chiazam> You can cast Bless during the fight Pat
[3:42:20] <ape_hawk> THICC pads
[3:42:21] <+Shonen_hero> bulk selling just sells all your junk
[3:42:22] <%HolePunchLeaf> @Agami23 cause by that point usually your priest has already been cut in half
[3:42:26] <%Piemono> Bulk Sell gets rid of Garbage
[3:42:26] <+Shonen_hero> it's junk
[3:42:27] <+emperri> wowowowowo
[3:42:30] <%laserbeaming> It sells the useless junk
[3:42:31] <+JJJKopf> all junk
[3:42:32] <+BigCoffee> bulk selling is trash
[3:42:37] <%Gogogolem> white trash itesm
[3:42:39] <+megaman_sentinel> will you be streaming this more
[3:42:39] <%Nekros4442> That's all junk Pat
[3:42:49] <%TheFabledAble> click the button next to bulk selling
[3:42:55] <%Gogogolem> keep fish
[3:42:58] <%alphonseisbest> @alphonseisbest that sound right! ty... is that class in these games?
[3:42:59] <$mattynezz> @patstaresat There is a mod that you can just give yourself infinite casting, of you don't think you can ever beat the goblins, then just put the difficulty on Hard or something
[3:43:02] <+Shonen_hero> see that purple bar with the - through it?
[3:43:07] <+Shonen_hero> That's a selectable
[3:43:09] <%laserbeaming> the game is not good at tutorials. And it kind of expects you to have played the Tabletop before for a lot of stuff.
[3:43:10] <%Ghufufin> @alphonseisbest not that directly comes to mind, there some specific spells and abilities but you would have to go hunting for it.  Like a Kineticist is a bender like from avatar that can take damage to boost their abilities, or if you want to hit things with a sword and drain life first thing that comes to mind is magus that casts vampiric touch (but it will take a while to get there and magus has more mechanics than other classes)
[3:43:12] <+Shonen_hero> that helps you sort
[3:43:16] <%newtype89> tool tips pat read them lol
[3:43:25] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt select the long purple bar aboce your inventory stash
[3:43:42] <%TheFabledAble> np
[3:43:43] <akitanito> to sort
[3:43:46] <%cooldude69xx> @Agami23 The other reason is that you're better off trying to end the fight with a spell than buff because it means less turns of being swung at
[3:44:05] <CruxAustralis> you probably should get some health pots
[3:44:07] <CruxAustralis> they are good
[3:44:18] <%newtype89> cuyrently for you 20 rounds
[3:44:21] <%laserbeaming> That's 2 minutes now
[3:44:21] <CruxAustralis> though I don't think you need many of them in this first dungeon
[3:44:21] <+Prism_Zet> Hi PastaRat
[3:44:30] <DSD24> This game is really fun
[3:44:31] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Well im out, i hope the mind goblins dont get too bad, its not as complex as one might think to just play the game and beware of "One Guy" in chat. Hope you end up enjoying it @PatStaresAt
[3:44:54] <%laserbeaming> that bar is going to get filled pretty quickly for some characters
[3:45:00] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can choose the level of spells it shows in your spellbook by clickign the number on the right
[3:45:00] <chaosbringer28> in lvl 1, spellbook subcategorizes spells based on level of spell
[3:45:05] <%newtype89> he runing turn based?
[3:45:16] <CruxAustralis> I can't wait for Pat to get to the Might and Magic part PepeLaugh
[3:45:16] <DSD24> No more Wenduag
[3:45:19] <+BigCoffee> STOP FUCKING WORRYING
[3:45:23] <+transporterthesequel> PAT it's fine
[3:45:25] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt literally nothing else to do in the zone other than rest
[3:45:25] <CruxAustralis> @newtype89 yeah
[3:45:27] <+JJJKopf> whats wrong?
[3:45:28] <%ahomeschooldropout> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:45:28] <%cooldude69xx> Jesus Christ pat
[3:45:29] <%alphonseisbest> @Ghufufin hmmm, one person just told me of bloodragers they sem the closet to Dark knights at lest tonally. other wise yea doesn't seem like PF has many life darin options saddly, im the type that likes to play vamipre classes in things, btw are their playable vampires in PF?
[3:45:29] <chaosbringer28> rest takes 8 hours
[3:45:32] <+BigCoffee> The game cannot fuck you over
[3:45:35] <+JJJKopf> you just got them back
[3:45:35] <Badgerconda_> Jesus christ pat you need to calm the fuck down you weirdo
[3:45:35] <Visorak6> You'll be fine
[3:45:37] <DSD24> @CruxAustralis That's like 12 hours in
[3:45:37] <+DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt it's not like kingmaker time passing doesn't matter
[3:45:38] <%Agami23> pats OCD, he cant stop worrying.
[3:45:40] <%laserbeaming> It is fine. There wasn't anything to do
[3:45:43] <%vaporousTippler> Pat's head will explode when he gets to the tavern. Calling it.
[3:45:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you didnt miss anything important
[3:45:46] <chaosbringer28> the game is designed around it, im sure its fine
[3:45:47] <+Shonen_hero> you did click it
[3:45:49] <CruxAustralis> @BigCoffee there's like one moment that it can
[3:45:54] <DSD24> The game fucks you over with bad rolls
[3:45:54] <SilasDrekken> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:45:56] <+transporterthesequel> That's a scripted one that's supposed to happen, and you did everything you needed to do other than talk to one NPC for flavor
[3:45:59] <%athuramn> the game can but only if you chose it as a difficulty option @patstaresat
[3:46:02] <DSD24> Like how you keep rolling 1's
[3:46:02] <CruxAustralis> @DSD24 true LUL
[3:46:03] <%Giantsuperguy> @Ghufufin There are dhampirs, which are basically half-vampires
[3:46:13] <%Questiy> You haven't started anything important Pat, it only starts once it's in your journal
[3:46:17] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt I rested 5 times during a fucking SEIGE, with important npcs fighting n everything, no concequences
[3:46:18] <akitanito> because le evilulz
[3:46:18] <%Reaviar> its why its the evil option
[3:46:23] <chaosbringer28> to be evil
[3:46:36] <Jimhalla> cuz evil people are cartoons
[3:47:14] <%alphonseisbest> @Ghufufin oh cool, how does PF TREAT FULL VAMPIRES? are they like seen as monsters or just higher beings?
[3:47:14] <+Shonen_hero> salude
[3:47:17] <DSD24> No more Spider Cussy
[3:47:18] <%Ghufufin> @alphonseisbest bloodrager would be closest in tone, get mad and hit man with sword, eventually shoot magic, and yea Dhampir (descendant of Vamp) is the closest playable option
[3:47:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> bless you
[3:47:31] <tanarath> rip spussy
[3:47:37] <%laserbeaming> It's so weird for a Fighter to get outclassed in weapon use, but Lann is so busted that it overcomes the Class Gap
[3:47:39] <akitanito> is the archer gone?
[3:47:41] <chaosbringer28> 5+hanger on, to 4
[3:47:46] <+EXPsoon> Man there is few good evil options in the game but later on when you get your mythic they become more fun
[3:47:47] <DSD24> No don't worry Pat
[3:47:49] <%Ghufufin> @alphonseisbest also u askin for in this video game or for TTRPG? b/c those are two very different answers
[3:47:50] <%deviljhojho_> it is
[3:47:51] <%vaporousTippler> The tricks haven't begun yet.
[3:47:53] <DSD24> This game is really tough
[3:47:53] <CruxAustralis> @TheFabledAble I did not manage to rest in the Keep LUL did like the latter half of that dungeon without any spells
[3:47:54] <%BinaryFireball> you are just inexperienced young pat
[3:47:54] <+transporterthesequel> No you're really not! And that's normal for Pathfinder, lol
[3:47:57] <%newtype89> wrong way
[3:47:57] <%cooldude69xx> Pat, no one is better at tricking you than you are
[3:47:57] <CruxAustralis> it was brutal
[3:48:00] <Badgerconda_> The only one trying to trick you are your brain goblins, pat.
[3:48:00] <%alphonseisbest> all good Pat, ur still new
[3:48:00] <%Fooguwu> DnD isn't supposed to give you perfect information patrick
[3:48:01] <%Agami23> thats how D&D feels sometimes
[3:48:02] <+DragonArt07> your worrying too much
[3:48:05] <+JJJKopf> oh you just wait
[3:48:05] <+Templar26> I tuned in late, what class did Pat choose?
[3:48:05] <%faldin> the seagulls wont get you here
[3:48:09] <+transporterthesequel> Dude I spent literally 10 hours to get to THIS POINT.
[3:48:09] <Visorak6> Its not trying to trick you its just making assumptions about you that arent wholly accurate
[3:48:09] <+Shonen_hero> it's alright man, I get that you've never played this before, and while I love this game the UI tool tips are little obtuse
[3:48:09] <%ahomeschooldropout> it's ok, Pathfinder is incredibly brutal
[3:48:13] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt its no prob bro <3 we all know its complex, just take your time and soon enough youll feel confident
[3:48:14] <%BinaryFireball> just go with the flow
[3:48:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you shouldnt have specced into the Seagull build then
[3:48:15] <%athuramn> @patstaresat if you want some peace of mind, go look at the bottom most options in difficulty to see what the game CANT do
[3:48:16] <%Piemono> I feel like you need someone to walk you through this verbally
[3:48:17] <%laserbeaming> It's a pretty rough game
[3:48:18] <+transporterthesequel> You are fuckin FLYING through this.
[3:48:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's poorly translated lol
[3:48:21] <%Gogogolem> Pat this isn't Kingmaker its not out to get you.
[3:48:22] <%TheFabledAble> @TheFabledAble ooooof xD
[3:48:22] <chaosbringer28> yea, i remember my first experiance with tt games (which was pathfinder) was kind of like this
[3:48:23] <akitanito> pathfinder just seems like they went off the deep end with number crunching
[3:48:24] <+archangel9889> isn't that typical for crpg games
[3:48:29] <%Sunriser41> there is one and only one part of the game that it can fuck you over, and chat is gonna be screaming at you once you get here
[3:48:30] <tanarath> It speaks a dumb dialect, you're overthinking it
[3:48:32] <%laserbeaming> it's shit
[3:48:33] <%TheFabledAble> thats hilariously bad
[3:48:38] <+Shonen_hero> It's made Russians I think? So I imagine a lot of this is translated from Russian
[3:48:38] <Badgerconda_> Pat needs a little V to help him.
[3:48:39] <vicar_anat> Why play with the DM when you can accuse him of TRICKERY?
[3:48:40] <%MelBrooksKA> That's not the game, that's us @PatStaresAt spyCappa spyCappa
[3:48:41] <%Nekros4442> Yep, marching orders
[3:48:42] <joodatious> pat played all baldurs gate games and they were far more clear
[3:48:49] <Jimhalla> ah the old marching line
[3:48:50] <joodatious> this game is horrible at presenting its rules
[3:48:57] <%chance_h> Yep that feeling is normal and only goes away after the second play through
[3:48:58] <%Fooguwu> "Hey DM, is there a boss coming up? Should I cast this spell now or wait?"
[3:48:58] <chaosbringer28> its because your character's class isnt a dedicated melee class, so it favours mid-line
[3:48:58] <%Ghufufin> @alphonseisbest depends but typical lore is full on Draculas that are typically related to EVIL and some undead god of evil, so basically straight monster with little grey area
[3:48:59] <%CatRidder> the games is very obtuse and you havent play pen and paper path
[3:48:59] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Pathfinder was created by people who hated the transition from 3.5 to 4e as "dumbing down D&D", so it makes sense it's hyper-dense
[3:49:00] <%laserbeaming> try hitting it with a bow first
[3:49:02] <+transporterthesequel> @Sunriser41 Shhh let him enjoy the game before mythic paths
[3:49:03] <DSD24> Now imagine having the weight effecting speed option on
[3:49:03] <chaosbringer28> at least thats my guess
[3:49:06] <+DeadPhoenix3> thac0
[3:49:06] <%cooldude69xx> @akitanito It's why I love it. You can make the most specific characters in the world
[3:49:12] <%TheFabledAble> use charge
[3:49:12] <%laserbeaming> charge!
[3:49:13] <%newtype89> charge
[3:49:14] <akitanito> because you're a dwarf
[3:49:15] <$mattynezz> charge
[3:49:16] <Visorak6> Charge
[3:49:17] <+Shonen_hero> charge
[3:49:17] <%alphonseisbest> @Shonen_hero is Russian hard to translate into english?
[3:49:17] <%Ghufufin> ChARGE!
[3:49:17] <+DeadPhoenix3> you can charge
[3:49:17] <%CatRidder> chanrge
[3:49:17] <D_Eye2> charge would work here
[3:49:18] <CruxAustralis> that's a dwarf for you LUL
[3:49:19] <%BinaryFireball> so back it up
[3:49:20] <%TheFabledAble> charge will give you an attack
[3:49:20] <%Nekros4442> charge
[3:49:20] <%Gogogolem> you're a dwarf.
[3:49:22] <Solokaldaka> thats what you get for going dwarf
[3:49:22] <CruxAustralis> CHARGE
[3:49:22] <Jimhalla> Charge
[3:49:23] <%AncelDeLambert> well then start with Bless
[3:49:24] <%Gogogolem> You got short legs
[3:49:24] <YuriSix_> Chargeee
[3:49:24] <akitanito> you can charge
[3:49:25] <+transporterthesequel> NAH
[3:49:26] <%Monkeyweed21> DORF LEGS
[3:49:27] <+JJJKopf> such is a dorfs life
[3:49:29] <chaosbringer28> welcoem to playing a dwarf, your a slow boy
[3:49:35] <%TheFabledAble> just click it
[3:49:36] <$mattynezz> NO
[3:49:37] <tanarath> charge
[3:49:38] <%laserbeaming> no, just use it
[3:49:38] <%cooldude69xx> @ShoggothLibrarian 4e had a lot more problems than simplifying things.
[3:49:40] <%laserbeaming> charge
[3:49:40] <CruxAustralis> click the charge button
[3:49:40] <%Gogogolem> No
[3:49:40] <+Shonen_hero> no
[3:49:41] <+BigCoffee> hit charge now
[3:49:42] <CruxAustralis> NO
[3:49:43] <$mattynezz> CHARGE IS THE ATTACK
[3:49:44] <+DragonArt07> click it
[3:49:44] <+DeadPhoenix3> the movement is a part of the charge
[3:49:44] <akitanito> charge is move + attack
[3:49:47] <CruxAustralis> yothere you go
[3:49:47] <+JJJKopf> no
[3:49:47] <+DragonArt07> no
[3:49:47] <%Nekros4442> no just use it
[3:49:48] <DSD24> NICE
[3:49:49] <chaosbringer28> its part of charge action
[3:49:50] <chaosbringer28> NO
[3:49:51] <%laserbeaming> it's using the Tabletop text
[3:49:53] <DSD24> That was good damage
[3:49:54] <akitanito> at least you hit something
[3:49:59] <+xenoboost> what up klt
[3:50:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, it's D&D, be glad you hit
[3:50:02] <tanarath> click charge
[3:50:05] <%cooldude69xx> @Shonen_hero It is a totally different alphabet
[3:50:20] <+transporterthesequel> Yellow move means you can't attack
[3:50:24] <akitanito> charge is move + attack, you can't charge after move
[3:50:25] <Visorak6> She's used both her actions to move that far
[3:50:26] <%Ghufufin> she had to double move
[3:50:26] <chaosbringer28> used full turn to move
[3:50:29] <chaosbringer28> she cant attack
[3:50:30] <$mattynezz> Charge is a move and attack together
[3:50:32] <%laserbeaming> The language is super weird because it's (mostly) copy pasted from the Player's Handbook @PatStaresAt
[3:50:34] <%Ghufufin> you have to click charge before you move
[3:50:41] <tanarath> click charge first
[3:50:42] <DSD24> You moved before charging
[3:50:44] <CruxAustralis> charge takes your entire turn
[3:50:46] <%Piemono> The Charge is the 10ft move
[3:50:48] <$mattynezz> THE MOVE IS A PART OF THE ACTION
[3:50:49] <+Shonen_hero> you must have a clear path
[3:50:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt used too much movement
[3:50:50] <%TheFabledAble> Thats just how it functions, just click it and click an enemy in ranged
[3:50:50] <CruxAustralis> you can't do anything before charge
[3:50:52] <chaosbringer28> charging includes the move
[3:50:53] <%athuramn> charge REQUIRES the movement, it's not optional
[3:50:54] <+Shonen_hero> and line of sight
[3:50:55] <notsoy> no, you have to pick Charge BEFORE you move
[3:50:56] <%animaturgy> @PatStaresAt Charge takes your full turn, you can't move first
[3:50:56] <DSD24> Nice!
[3:50:56] <%sw_paladin> Charge is move and attack
[3:51:00] <+Gondab> I tried playing a pathfinder game before but got scared off because I had to be a certain alignment for the class I wanted to play.
[3:51:01] <chaosbringer28> dont move before hitting charge, it includes the move in it
[3:51:06] <YuriSix_> Charge is min 10ft
[3:51:08] <akitanito> no, you can't move before charging
[3:51:10] <Flagnalok> Owlcat just copy pasted the tabletop rules
[3:51:12] <%PlatinumAvacyn> that sentence is like pnp copy paste. it doesn't make sense in this
[3:51:14] <%hrbeck_> Its all in one pat
[3:51:18] <+BigCoffee> It's a full round attack so it does moving and attackign
[3:51:18] <%newtype89> its a abilaty pat you hit the button and it dose the action
[3:51:18] <%Piemono> Charge is your move + attack
[3:51:19] <%faldin> it could be clearer
[3:51:19] <%athuramn> charge REQUIRES the movement, it's not optional @patstaresat
[3:51:20] <%laserbeaming> It's copy pasted from the Tabletop Rules
[3:51:23] <%newtype89> think of it like a spell
[3:51:25] <%TheDullaMAN> You're overthinking. Just click the action and it'll do it for you.
[3:51:25] <akitanito> it's poorly worded
[3:51:25] <ScrubTheNerd> That's using tabletop language when it should be written for the video game
[3:51:25] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt the problem with the tool tips is that they take them out of the book when the game plays differently
[3:51:26] <$mattynezz> It's a description, not instructions
[3:51:27] <+BigCoffee> It's all in 1 pat
[3:51:28] <%animaturgy> Its worded badly here
[3:51:29] <@GeneralSCPatton> The charge includes the movement
[3:51:29] <%newtype89> no
[3:51:30] <Visorak6> Charge = must be the first thing you do, the "must move before attacking" is a holdover from tabletop @PatStaresAt
[3:51:31] <%laserbeaming> It makes sense
[3:51:33] <%Sunriser41> yea, the tooltips is the tabletop rules, the game rules are kinda diferent and its confusing
[3:51:34] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt No you're TOTALLY right
[3:51:35] <illTemperedSeaBass> That doesn't mean you move before charging. You have to charge someone 10 or more feet away. @PatStaresAt
[3:51:37] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt what that means is youre character cant charge if theyre closer than 10 feet
[3:51:38] <+ShoggothLibrarian> @PatStaresAt Charge is a double movement + attack
[3:51:39] <Badgerconda_> Pat, get someone who knows how to play pathfinder to explain things to you
[3:51:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Its a FULL ROUND ACTION you it takes your whole turn
[3:51:39] <chaosbringer28> its essentially using the wording from the TT rulebook
[3:51:39] <CruxAustralis> not really no
[3:51:41] <%athuramn> your line of thinking makes sense
[3:51:43] <+DeadPhoenix3> its poorly worded for the gmae yeah
[3:51:44] <Jimhalla> it does, the tooltips are just bad
[3:51:45] <%chiazam> No
[3:51:47] <+transporterthesequel> The tooltip is just worded weird.
[3:51:48] <%hrbeck_> Allinone
[3:51:49] <joodatious> they should of written it better
[3:51:49] <+BigCoffee> It's the description of the ability not the rules to use it
[3:51:50] <illTemperedSeaBass> It is worded horrendously.
[3:51:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> It means the ability moves you before the attack happens, it's poorly worded
[3:51:51] <chaosbringer28> which isnt exactly correct to video game controls
[3:51:52] <akitanito> you're wrong, but they aren't doing a good job to telling you either
[3:51:53] <%animaturgy> @PatStaresAt Its worded badly, its saying you can't move AFTER a charge
[3:51:53] <%PlatinumAvacyn> it's text directly from one
[3:51:53] <%Ghufufin> yea the descriptions are from the TTRP and nothing has been to done make it easier in the video game
[3:51:53] <tanarath> yeah, kinda
[3:51:53] <mikeriffic> I like this game but it is not nearly as acceible or user friendly as baldurs gate 3 so far
[3:51:57] <%sw_paladin> It's worded badly
[3:52:05] <notsoy> you've already used it multiple times correctly though lol
[3:52:06] <+Vigonept> DND just sucks at being way to wordy and confusing about it
[3:52:07] <Visorak6> Theres no need to rest
[3:52:15] <luftraumm1> ttrpgs are hard as balls to translate into pc
[3:52:20] <$mattynezz> Don't rest unless you need to
[3:52:26] <%laserbeaming> Demonic Corruption is not a mechanic right now.
[3:52:30] <%cooldude69xx> @mikeriffic At least I dont hate all the party members so far
[3:52:38] <chaosbringer28> watch the action bar above the hotbar and it will give a better idea
[3:52:39] <%hrbeck_> This is a waste
[3:52:42] <CruxAustralis> resting right now is a bad idea
[3:52:44] <chaosbringer28> when in combat that is
[3:52:46] <joodatious> @Vigonept thats a bad excuse Baldurs gate 3 explained things just fine
[3:52:50] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt there is a button on the bottum right of the menu that optimizes placement for camp
[3:52:52] <+Shonen_hero> you know what fucked up the mongrels? That can happen to you, flavor wise, but mechanically it means like stat debuffs if you let it get too high
[3:52:53] <%laserbeaming> The Corruption mechanic kicks in after the first dungeon
[3:52:55] <joodatious> this is just shitty tutorials
[3:53:02] <joodatious> which is especially bad for a game like this
[3:53:05] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt click the person icon bottum right of the left menu
[3:53:08] <%Nekros4442> Corruption only happens after the tutorial
[3:53:11] <%chiazam> Resting is NOT a safe action
[3:53:12] <Gorgs7> is he really resting because of 6 damage?
[3:53:23] <%hrbeck_> Yep
[3:53:24] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Literally none of this matters yet
[3:53:27] <chaosbringer28> only rest when you need health/spells back
[3:53:28] <%TheFabledAble> he is
[3:53:30] <%cooldude69xx> @Vigonept Baldurs gate has magic missles that miss. It isnt exactly faithful
[3:53:41] <DSD24> She literally broke a nail
[3:53:42] <+JJJKopf> did you just rest 6 damage
[3:53:51] <joodatious> @Vigonept thats a bug that was fixed
[3:53:52] <%SpoonheadInExile> Tumblr detected
[3:53:55] <akitanito> I hope she took damage from that
[3:53:57] <AzureGale> veiLUL
[3:53:59] <$mattynezz> Pat, you can get away with it right now, but later, only rest when you need to
[3:54:01] <%TheFabledAble> omg
[3:54:01] <akitanito> corruption
[3:54:01] <+transporterthesequel> Like, Charge is literally a move and attack in one button, but you need a clear path(and that'll be flustrating.) You can't move before using it...well, yet, I suppose, and you...normally, can't attack after charging
[3:54:07] <+BigCoffee> omg pat
[3:54:08] <$mattynezz> No
[3:54:09] <Visorak6> For now
[3:54:10] <%animaturgy> Its fine to yeah
[3:54:12] <%Piemono> Later in the game that is not an option
[3:54:13] <%laserbeaming> No corruption right now
[3:54:13] <Badgerconda_> Brain gobolins
[3:54:15] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt just so you know later on you need resting supplies
[3:54:16] <+BigCoffee> you're on normal you won't perma die
[3:54:16] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Because you just spent 8 hours to heal trivialdamage
[3:54:16] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt If you rest too much you'll become fatigued.
[3:54:18] <%Nekros4442> You can do that now. After the first dungeon you get punished
[3:54:18] <chaosbringer28> because 10 hours just passed
[3:54:20] <$mattynezz> A bar of fuck you will be added later
[3:54:20] <%alphonseisbest> for now
[3:54:21] <Visorak6> And you're risking a surprise attack every time you rest
[3:54:21] <%Sunriser41> for now sure, later it has some drawbacks
[3:54:23] <+JJJKopf> which are HEAVY
[3:54:24] <DSD24> If you rest too much then the Corruption will start being a problem later on
[3:54:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> Because of the corruption, tho it only starts after the tutorial
[3:54:26] <+Shonen_hero> I mean you can, but like you said resting moves time forward
[3:54:27] <chaosbringer28> now yes, later no
[3:54:29] <%Ghufufin> you can rest right now yes, there will be a penalty later on
[3:54:35] <+Vigonept> but rhe corruption
[3:54:35] <%Monkeyweed21> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:54:35] <tanarath> Not later, it's a dangerous thing later.
[3:54:36] <%Valdorick> Sloth
[3:54:36] <%laserbeaming> no you don't become fatigue
[3:54:36] <%animaturgy> Wait really, thats dumb
[3:54:36] <MechaBaphomet> bad habit inc. Kappa
[3:54:36] <%chiazam> No you cannot, you could get attacked or become corrupted
[3:54:36] <$mattynezz> You become corrupted
[3:54:37] <%cooldude69xx> @Vigonept Good. Now they could try translating a system that isnt for babies
[3:54:38] <+ScrapKingKeita> haven't you ever taken a nap and woke up feeling like shit?
[3:54:40] <%Piemono> It will be an issue later
[3:54:43] <%Nekros4442> Why do you read out the wrongest guy lol
[3:54:45] <%chiazam> Resting is not a free action
[3:54:47] <%Questiy> You have unlimited rest in this cave, its fine
[3:54:47] <%athuramn> well, based on irl logic, it does
[3:54:47] <%Sunriser41> on this dungeons it doesnt mater, afterwards there are some limitations
[3:54:47] <$mattynezz> You get give debuffs
[3:54:48] <tanarath> Bad habit to assume you can.
[3:54:48] <%laserbeaming> You get corruption, which doesn't apply right now
[3:54:49] <%ahomeschooldropout> After the tutorial you start becoming corrupted
[3:54:49] <Kivros> you are still in the tutorial area
[3:54:50] <+reknownblackcat> @PatStaresAt a party at rest stays at rest
[3:54:51] <vicar_anat> Another problem for future Pat
[3:54:55] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt each time you rest you will be increasing the demonic corruption level on your characters. eventually it will cause a debuff and you cant get rid of that debuff untill you rest in a "safe location" such as a hub city or town
[3:54:55] <YuriSix_> Theres mechanics in place to stop rest-scumming
[3:54:56] <+transporterthesequel> Oh you want to hard save now

[3:55:27] <%Broand> The progress of time
[3:55:27] <%Fooguwu> the town is burning down
[3:55:27] <+Vigonept> the dm
[3:55:27] <%Afterman_> anything that the dm wants
[3:55:28] <%vaporousTippler> The quest will fail if you take eight  years to save a kitten.
[3:55:28] <joodatious> losing time
[3:55:28] <lord_sykos> the world still exists
[3:55:28] <Punzosaurus> Usually time cost
[3:55:29] <%TheDullaMAN> The DM
[3:55:29] <+JJJKopf> the DM having a thief at night or monsters attack
[3:55:29] <%PlatinumAvacyn> DM throws monsters at you
[3:55:29] <%chiazam> The DM
[3:55:29] <Visorak6> The DM ambushes the party
[3:55:29] <@Jekado> monsters
[3:55:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> The DM
[3:55:30] <%cooldude69xx> Monsters attack at night
[3:55:30] <%MidnightBurst12> ambushes
[3:55:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Monsters ambushing you
[3:55:31] <%Nekros4442> The DM can ambush them in the middle of the night
[3:55:31] <mikeriffic> the DM can do random events tho
[3:55:31] <%IonVaporStudios> Monsters attack if you're not in a safe spot
[3:55:32] <Jimhalla> Plot
[3:55:32] <%SpoonheadInExile> Enemies, dangers
[3:55:32] <$zyberion626> a DM
[3:55:32] <illTemperedSeaBass> The DM would start throwing ambushes at the camp.
[3:55:32] <Flagnalok> NPCS die after time
[3:55:32] <+DeadPhoenix3> any the gm wants
[3:55:32] <%Agami23> or dungeons where its not safe to rest
[3:55:32] <%Alazull> random encounters/dm
[3:55:33] <$mattynezz> The DM will tell you no,
[3:55:33] <%chance_h> If you rest too much your guy develops depression which can only be cured via murder
[3:55:33] <@Jekado> Random encounters
[3:55:33] <tanarath> The dm
[3:55:33] <%Ghufufin> roaming monsters or bandits or other hazards in the area
[3:55:33] <Vyskus> Consequences
[3:55:34] <%snow_bush> The DM
[3:55:34] <+ShoggothLibrarian> The DM will send things to murder you for fucking with their story. That's it.
[3:55:34] <%Sunriser41> you got atacked during rest by a pack of wolves
[3:55:34] <mikeriffic> or time passes
[3:55:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt suprise attacks on the party
[3:55:35] <%Ynkubus_> The DM or players or plot
[3:55:35] <%AgniBrandt> Time constraints, too
[3:55:35] <+electrokev007> In 5th edition, you can only rest once per 24hr
[3:55:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Time lost
[3:55:36] <%spitelite> the dm will make a town explode
[3:55:36] <%SpoonheadInExile> hazards
[3:55:36] <@Ranryu692> the DM will come up with a way to stop you
[3:55:36] <DSD24> You can get ambushed while sleeping
[3:55:37] <%AyotoCorp> Enemy ambushes and failure from quest time events
[3:55:37] <+boriss96> sanity
[3:55:37] <@GeneralSCPatton> The DM will apply pressure and declare that bad shit happened in the world. Quest failures, etc.
[3:55:38] <+JustToWatch> "you rested to long and a meteor hit you"
[3:55:38] <+transporterthesequel> The DM will say, "You can't rest, there are monsters about."
[3:55:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> time passing, if you sleep in a dungeon you could force an encounter
[3:55:39] <jkfd> it depends on the scenario obviously
[3:55:39] <%dwhanson> The DM just sending bad guys at the party. Or a time sensitive plot
[3:55:40] <$zyberion626> no, but the DM
[3:55:40] <swansong118> Sometimes the Dm can throw surprise mobs at you disruypting your rest
[3:55:40] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> So there
[3:55:41] <+Vigonept> get ambushed, or some shit
[3:55:41] <rasamune> The DM, actually
[3:55:41] <+EmptyPenguin> The rules state that you only get the actual rest once every day
[3:55:41] <YuriSix_> DM just sents a kill party
[3:55:42] <hippofant> The DM will wreak their vengeance upon meta-gamers.
[3:55:42] <%sandrews> I think he means mechanically
[3:55:42] <%cooldude69xx> They might.
[3:55:43] <+haleford> The DM can make it so enemies appear and interrupt your rest
[3:55:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, I don't know if you know this, but sleeping around enemies is a bad thing
[3:55:44] <%strugglepunk2> "Oh the bad guy won because you took 2 months to clear the starter dungeon"
[3:55:45] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt in actual D&D the game progresses out of rest, so if your fighting like an invading demon army and you rest 9 times the army will win because of your horrible decision
[3:55:45] <chowndawg> Shit happening that require time
[3:55:46] <+AtomicUncoolguy> As a DM the only thing you can really do is throw monsters at them to interrupt it, or just straight tell them no.
[3:55:46] <+Dotta5> time lords
[3:55:46] <%athuramn> time sensitive questing
[3:55:47] <%MugenSandan> Time passes you're giving the DM a chance to attack you in your sleep
[3:55:47] <notsoy> the DM will do that
[3:55:49] <chaosbringer28> the Game master, it depends really based on the exact game and GM
[3:55:49] <akitanito> the DM could say the quest is time limited
[3:55:49] <tanarath> It tells a shitty story. consequences, bad ones
[3:55:52] <+DragonArt07> cause it would slow progress of the campaign
[3:55:53] <Gorgs7> @patstaresat the 12 extra encounters the dm adds at night
[3:55:54] <joodatious> the story continues without you
[3:55:55] <Visorak6> Time sensitive quests can become worse off at the DM's discretion @PatStaresAt
[3:55:56] <%Agami23> if theres no one on watch, you can get real fucked up
[3:55:56] <%cooldude69xx> The story might be time sensitive.
[3:55:56] <+EXPsoon> Literally the dm, he can just say, "your party tries to rest but you get 200 goblins on you"
[3:55:57] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Soo there's no mechanical reason not to rest after every encounter?
[3:55:59] <$mattynezz> The DM will say no, that's all that matters
[3:56:01] <%spitelite> the dm can make you miss important events
[3:56:01] <joodatious> yes
[3:56:02] <%Sunriser41> the game is balanced for 2 encounters between long rests
[3:56:03] <+JJJKopf> there aren't hard rules about it but the guides make recommendations
[3:56:03] <notsoy> the entire purpose of the DM is to stop stupid shit like sleeping 8 hours to rest a tiny cut
[3:56:06] <%animaturgy> @PatStaresAt Or a time limited quest like "oh shit the kingdom is under attack, we gotta get there ASAP"
[3:56:06] <%AncelDeLambert> the story won't wait, the campaign goes on
[3:56:07] <%ceremight> Time pressure. Also enemy ambushes if you rest in a dungeon.
[3:56:07] <+DeadPhoenix3> there might be time constraints as well for your quest
[3:56:09] <+DragonArt07> that's fine
[3:56:10] <%Agami23> you dont get the rest
[3:56:12] <+transporterthesequel> Also the DM has to keep account of time, and days will actually pass, end events will go forward if you rest too much.
[3:56:13] <%hrbeck_> Society
[3:56:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> The Guards come and attack you druing your rest
[3:56:14] <%SpoonheadInExile> Someone needs to be on watch
[3:56:14] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Ambushes, time constraints, the threat that the enemy may recover/get stronger and later encounters become more difficult
[3:56:14] <%strugglepunk2> "Oh the bad guy won because you took 2 months to clear the starter dungeon"
[3:56:17] <+gizlybertuz> hunger is a way to stop long rests
[3:56:18] <%thebeargoesHONK> DM says that you no longer get the benefit of a long rest.
[3:56:18] <akitanito> the DM could say the quest is time limited and you don't have time to rest
[3:56:20] <joodatious> @JustAnotherTrapArtist no it just could be dangerous
[3:56:20] <%TheDullaMAN> There's no mechanic that would do so, but the DM would like a story or session to move on.
[3:56:21] <$mattynezz> No
[3:56:23] <tanarath> failure of quests due to sitting on your ass during a siege, etc.
[3:56:24] <jkfd> IT DEPENDS ON THE SCENARIO. IF ACCORDING TO THE SCENARIO YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO REST YOU CAN'T REST
[3:56:24] <%zarkazeon> essentially yes it's the dm but
[3:56:24] <+Vigonept> sure thats ok, its doing it after every little fight every time
[3:56:25] <%Puhff> No, actually the DM
[3:56:26] <%chiazam> @patstaresat How efficient would an adventurer be if they laid down to rest for 4 hours every 10 minutes
[3:56:26] <@Ranryu692> no, you press on
[3:56:26] <CruxAustralis> you keep going my dude @PatStaresAt
[3:56:26] <swansong118> there is short rests and long rests
[3:56:26] <%Agami23> or you go to somewhere safe to rest
[3:56:27] <KilljoyHexx> no you dont have to rest again
[3:56:27] <count_bob> Then you don't get to rest.
[3:56:28] <%Fooguwu> You know how Left 4 Dead had an adaptive algorithm for difficulty? That's what DM's do
[3:56:28] <+Speed1ines> I would just kill the party in their sleep if they abuse it.
[3:56:29] <Flagnalok> That's if you win, DM might just kill the party
[3:56:30] <+BigCoffee> Your dm would kill you with wanderoing monsters
[3:56:31] <%Gogogolem> {at
[3:56:32] <Kivros> you get attacked while sleeping
[3:56:32] <%snow_bush> Not if your rest is interuppted
[3:56:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Unless the DM wants you to be fucked up going into the encounter
[3:56:33] <+archangel9889> People are saying the dm would punish you
[3:56:33] <%Alazull> I mean Pat the DM is final arbiter of the rules. They'd let you rest if it made sense
[3:56:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt You have supplies sometimes to think about
[3:56:35] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt the big enemy of the campaign isn't going to sit on his thumbs and wait for you, he's gonna sacrifice the princess
[3:56:35] <KilljoyHexx> you can use potions or suck it up
[3:56:35] <Badgerconda_> you're going to continually get attacked and end up worse off than you started @PatStaresAt
[3:56:36] <+JJJKopf> that's what spells and potions are for
[3:56:39] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt ARe you in a safe location after the boss fight? Did you make sure you cleared the entire dungeon? Sometimes it's not safe, sometimes you dont habve time to sleep 8 hours
[3:56:42] <%Puhff> You have never played Dnd so this is like trying to explain color to a blind person
[3:56:43] <%vaporousTippler> You'd run out of food, for one.
[3:56:44] <@Ranryu692> Pat time exists
[3:56:44] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt in D&D tabletop, the games story will progress with or without your input. if you chose to ignore an evil wizard that wizard will take over a kingdom. if you sleep through a raid, the raid happens while you sleep. thats the usual consequence
[3:56:45] <joodatious> 8 hours to be specific for a long rest
[3:56:45] <%Giantsuperguy> Then you keep resting and the village you were on your way to save is already burnt down by the bad guys
[3:56:46] <tanarath> Have to? are you sure?
[3:56:46] <chaosbringer28> yes for the full time, which in this case is 8 hours, so if your attacked 4 hours  in you would lose 12 hours overall
[3:56:46] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt if it's a good DM, they won't punish you for resting if you NEED it"
[3:56:46] <$mattynezz> No resting is sleep, you physically can't do that
[3:56:47] <count_bob> you need 4 uninterrupted hours.
[3:56:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Pat imagine a ffxiv party sleeping in a dungeon where mobs can run around while you sleep for hours, you'd never fully rest
[3:56:48] <%PlatinumAvacyn> there are short rests in 5e
[3:56:49] <+EXPsoon> Depends on the situation? in the middle of a battlefield or a siege, probably not @PatStaresAt
[3:56:50] <akitanito> ration was a thing
[3:56:50] <joodatious> short rests are an hour
[3:56:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you don't have infinite trail food and water
[3:56:52] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Time is a resource, Pat
[3:56:52] <%sandrews> @PatStaresAt The DM could be pathalogic 2 time progression of the story
[3:56:53] <%Broand> Resting takes time which is the most important resource
[3:56:53] <Visorak6> You can only carry so many supplies to make camp @PatStaresAt
[3:56:54] <%Sunriser41> yea, the dm is just gonna murder you
[3:56:54] <%SpoonheadInExile> The DM would punish that
[3:56:54] <swansong118> It depends if the abilities used come back on a short or long rest
[3:56:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> time still passes when you sleep pat
[3:56:55] <%laserbeaming> You also have limited supplies in real D&D
[3:56:56] <+BigCoffee> Your DM will make you consume foot, lose ammo and fight wadnering monsters
[3:56:56] <Solokaldaka> also food may be an issue if you take too long in table top
[3:57:01] <%zarkazeon> it's situations like "if you d9nt go thru this dungeon in 4 hours children die
[3:57:01] <friedsquidiot> The dm decides. There’s also short rests which do less
[3:57:01] <%athuramn> just look at the bottom of the difficulty options if you want to see what CANT possibly happen to you
[3:57:02] <notsoy> but then they'd NEVER ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING
[3:57:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt resting often uses resources like firewood and food
[3:57:06] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt Basically simulated real life is what keeps you from abusing rest in campaigns.
[3:57:06] <%spitelite> time is a resource
[3:57:07] <SolumFuturae> A good DM will weigh if the players want to be healed to enjoy combat more and balance it by giving them resources to heal up and have the fights compenstate for them being full up.
[3:57:10] <YuriSix_> resting takes resources
[3:57:11] <+ScrapKingKeita> Its a gameplay vs narrative thing. Munchkin gaming, you basically just worry about the timer on the campaign, but in a social setting, it just is trying everyone's patience.
[3:57:12] <+Shonen_hero> yeah I like a lot of the environments in this game
[3:57:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Things can happen while you rest
[3:57:14] <tanarath> In terms of success? 0
[3:57:14] <%hrbeck_> Time is a resipource too
[3:57:15] <+DeadPhoenix3> having infinite health isn't very useful if the people you are helping died because you took too long
[3:57:16] <Mildly_Eccentric> time sensitive quests, imagine if the BBEG just won cause you slept for a month straight
[3:57:18] <@GeneralSCPatton> IT SURE IS A GOOD THING THAT THE WORLD DOESN'T PROGRESS WITHOUT YOU, OH WAIT. QUEST FAILED, TOWN DESTROYED.
[3:57:20] <%thebeargoesHONK> Pat imagine if you had to literally lay down for 4-8 hours after doing any and every little thing. now imagine that Peach wasn't there to keep you from starving to death
[3:57:22] <%chiazam> It terms of resources, TIME IS A RESOURCE
[3:57:23] <%arizenarkana> You can also be too late to stop the bad shit from happening
[3:57:24] <luftraumm1> it's very hard to explain in terms that would work on a video game
[3:57:25] <+Shonen_hero> This game is jank as fuck, but there's some good here
[3:57:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> Villain accomplishes plans while you slept
[3:57:25] <%MugenSandan> Pat I think the issue is you're looking at DnD purely as a game instead of as a roleplaying experience
[3:57:26] <borkmire> most DM's have a hidden time limit for the quest the party is doing so the would most likely miss the time limit and fail the quest
[3:57:32] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt there are also short rests that regain a LOT of character resources. some spellcasters even get a limited amount of spells back from their class features
[3:57:38] <%Agami23> it depends on how your resting is. sometimes its better to go find a safe place to rest rather than just resting on the spot
[3:57:41] <%Puhff> Pat, this isn't Resident Evil
[3:57:41] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Baphomet is a cool dude, you should probably worship him
[3:57:44] <+Vigonept> well hope those resources were worth the 2 weeks it took ya to get to the demon lords castle, oh hes op now cause he finished his ritual in those 2 weeks
[3:57:47] <+JJJKopf> food, time, other players getting annoyed at you
[3:57:50] <alternatecoyote> Characters can and will die of old age, Pat.
[3:57:52] <$zyberion626> congrats it took you guys 6 months to make a 8 day journey, everyone is dead.
[3:57:56] <joodatious> Baldurs gate 3 uses a food system where you need 40 supplies worth of food every rest. and since items are finite you have to use it at specific times
[3:57:57] <%Piemono> It's crazy how broke Pat's brain is
[3:58:01] <KilljoyHexx> If people try to over rest in my games I say they get disadvantage, cos going from doing nothing all day to shit a fight is tough on you
[3:58:02] <%laserbeaming> @PatStaresAt start combat by having Lann hit people with an arrow.
[3:58:03] <%Alazull> @patstaresat D&D design typically accounts for two to three encounters between rests assuming something is an even challenge
[3:58:04] <joodatious> plus story things continue after resting
[3:58:05] <akitanito> pfft he's too far
[3:58:13] <%animaturgy> @TheFabledAble That more of a thing in 5e, yeah. Most pathfinder stuff is long rest only
[3:58:21] <@Ranryu692> you can't rest after every fight because that gives Peach and Bowser too much alone time
[3:58:22] <mikeriffic> Yea its really up to the DM to set the penalty @PatStaresAt but mechanically in a game like this....nothing unless if a time limit on events is present or it costs X resources to set up camp. I most cases youll be fine, within reason
[3:58:22] <fugly_nick> I did not expect this to be turn based
[3:58:23] <Gorgs7> @patstaresat keep in mind it's also uninterrupted rest, a shifty kobold could throw a rock at you every couple hours to duck with your rest
[3:58:23] <+transporterthesequel> @Piemono He didn't ask a dumb question. Mechanically that WOULD be an issue.
[3:58:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat metas so hard he fucks himself same with woolie
[3:58:27] <friedsquidiot> If your dm is fine with you resting after every encounter then you can but chances are they’ll employ some sort of narrative that discourages that in order to build tension
[3:58:31] <akitanito> >1 damage
[3:58:41] <%strugglepunk2> Lann kinda fucks
[3:58:44] <CruxAustralis> Lann is good LUL
[3:58:45] <+DeadPhoenix3> zen archer monks son
[3:58:48] <%Reaviar> lann doesnt mess around
[3:58:48] <+Shonen_hero> Lann can attack twice if he doesn't move
[3:58:49] <$zyberion626> the resource management is part of the fun @patstaresat it gets boring if you reset after every combat encounter
[3:58:58] <%newtype89> lann is good
[3:59:00] <+Shonen_hero> whoa
[3:59:03] <joodatious> this games party members are so much more annoying then the first game
[3:59:03] <%Sunriser41> like, in dnd the dm is suposed to keep the world moving along you, is diferent from a pc game where there are some triggers that move the story along
[3:59:06] <%laserbeaming> Lann hits twice if he doesn't move or makes only a 5-foot step
[3:59:06] <%TheFabledAble> @TheFabledAble right which is why its an important distinction. I think the invention of the short rest REALLY helped break up the amount of long rests a party will take
[3:59:17] <akitanito> too far, just set up I guess
[3:59:18] <%sw_paladin> There you go!
[3:59:19] <%PlatinumAvacyn> laughs in 5e warlock
[3:59:20] <friedsquidiot> There are no official rules that punish players for resting
[3:59:37] <+EmptyPenguin> from the Players Handbook: "A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits."
[3:59:40] <KilljoyHexx> @PlatinumAvacyn suck it other magic users
[3:59:45] <joodatious> good music blending guys...
[3:59:56] <joodatious> this is a issue they had in the first game!
[3:59:58] <joodatious> come on
[3:59:58] <%Agami23> i dont know why, but that elf girl going "the spirits demand your blood!" reminds me of the cosplayer pokket when she did D&D
[4:00:00] <joodatious> MUSIC
[4:00:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Think of Long rests like First aid Sprays in Resident evil.
[4:00:11] <%PlatinumAvacyn> the official rule that punishes resting is the GM because there is no game without a GM
[4:00:12] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt This is VERY IMPORTANT. You will get a TON of cure light wounds potions in this dungeon. USE THEM. And use your cure spells as well, you can rest at least 2 times in here(I did when I cleared it).
[4:00:13] <%newtype89> I love how pats shifting between this game runs like shit and loving all the little things lol
[4:00:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Both are accurate.
[4:00:43] <+DeadPhoenix3> you probably have some level 9 spells you can use for range
[4:00:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Also Pat you can't Long rest more then once every 24 hours
[4:00:48] <+DeadPhoenix3> level 0*
[4:00:52] <%Ghufufin> you couldnt charge there because she couldnt draw a straight unobstructed line to the target
[4:00:57] <%cooldude69xx> @TheFabledAble Im in a 5e game and we have a druid who wanted to rest after every fight still. It was always the casters that caused this issue, and they're still there
[4:00:59] <CruxAustralis> yep
[4:01:00] <+Shonen_hero> I'm not sure how I feel about Lann personality wise, but out of the box he's combat fit
[4:01:06] <%laserbeaming> In the tabletop you can't. Here you can.
[4:01:12] <KilljoyHexx> but you can short rest
[4:01:17] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Pat, is it true that Daffy Duck rapped about slamming his penis in the car door?
[4:01:26] <tanarath> hmmm, wasted efficiency
[4:01:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Lann sucks as a character but his gameplay makes people like him.
[4:01:30] <@Ranryu692> 4 hours vs 8 hours
[4:01:31] <+haleford> Short is 30 minutes, Long rest is 8 hours
[4:01:31] <Gorgs7> 7 hours
[4:01:32] <%laserbeaming> Those are 5E mechanics. Not Pathfinder
[4:01:33] <CruxAustralis> @PatStaresAt short is 1hr long is 8
[4:01:34] <joodatious> @TheFabledAble thats when you tell them to stop wasting their spell slots so quickly lmao
[4:01:34] <scrumbotime> Short is like, An Hour, Long is 8+
[4:01:35] <%PlatinumAvacyn> short rest is 5e innit?
[4:01:35] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:01:37] <swansong118> Depends on which abilities come back on short or long rests
[4:01:40] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Short/Long Rest is a 5e thing, it literally doesn't exist here
[4:01:40] <KilljoyHexx> some classes get stuff on short rests and some get stuff on long rests.
[4:01:41] <%SpoonheadInExile> What?
[4:01:42] <Visorak6> Short rest recovers stuff for certain classes iirc
[4:01:42] <chaosbringer28> short rest is a dnd 5e mechanic, not in this game
[4:01:42] <+Jack8274> Haven't we all at some point?
[4:01:42] <@GeneralSCPatton> Short and Long Rests are 5e
[4:01:44] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Hoo, boy... I don't think I'm ready for this psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[4:01:47] <swansong118> Short rest is an hour usually, and a long is 8
[4:01:48] <%Agami23> short rest doesent fully restore everything. a long rest fully heals and brings back all spell slots
[4:01:52] <+JustToWatch> short is nap long is sleep
[4:01:54] <friedsquidiot> Time and resources recovered
[4:01:56] <%CatRidder> short rest is only a 5e thing
[4:02:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Short trest is about 30-a hour where you can recover some health or cure minor afflictions
[4:02:00] <%Alazull> Come on and slam?
[4:02:00] <%Questiy> Lann's a contradiction where his first impression is a dreamer of hope before shitting on everyone else about being dreamers
[4:02:04] <fugly_nick> Pat's character looks fuckin angry next to everyone else
[4:02:05] <notsoy> use the dang potions
[4:02:06] <chowndawg> short rests aren't a thing in pathfinder
[4:02:06] <%TheFabledAble> @TheFabledAble totally. youd think people would learn to use their resources effectively but nope, gotta cast fireball on trash and never use cantrips or your weapon
[4:02:07] <Dlent_> Short rest doesn’t exist in this game
[4:02:11] <+transporterthesequel> Also, this dungeon will teach you that every room can be a fuck.
[4:02:11] <tanarath> short is some stuff comes back, long rest is everything comes back
[4:02:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> There is still an upper limit on Short trests
[4:02:19] <$mattynezz> Use your wand
[4:02:21] <+JustToWatch> BABY
[4:02:23] <%Ghufufin> use wand or potions to heal
[4:02:29] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> KISS DAT BOY doodBait
[4:02:32] <%CatRidder> PET
[4:02:32] <joodatious> why are there no short rests that sucks ass
[4:02:34] <+JJJKopf> why rest if it's only for a heal when cam has healing wand and heal spells
[4:02:34] <+transporterthesequel> Potions area BAD use in combat, make sure to use them out of combat.
[4:02:39] <%Monkeyweed21> just use your many healing spells
[4:02:40] <scrumbotime> BIG BOY
[4:02:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> You opened the box and Gief Came!
[4:02:47] <%RealThiele> devil woman smirk
[4:02:49] <%TheDullaMAN> SNARF
[4:02:52] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Thank you
[4:02:52] <+transporterthesequel> *are
[4:02:52] <%peyodogo> chunker
[4:02:59] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you get an insane amount of healing potions in this dungeon. use the basic ones between combat
[4:03:01] <+DeadPhoenix3> in case you forgot, your paladin now has a heal ability as well
[4:03:03] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL
[4:03:07] <leinadtonu> Pat's family loves him, what a loser.
[4:03:10] <%laserbeaming> Kingmaker had controller support
[4:03:13] <fugly_nick> @doc_ock_rokc I wish Pinhead could say the same
[4:03:20] <terrible35> how much EXP is gief at
[4:03:22] <%cooldude69xx> @TheFabledAble I do, but I'm not the DM. Character died tho, so now we'll seeif a Bards more his speed
[4:03:25] <+Shonen_hero> much like FF14 don't stand in color
[4:03:53] <$mattynezz> You need to
[4:03:56] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Ohhhh noooooo
[4:03:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat you need to.
[4:03:57] <+BigCoffee> pat this isnt final fnatasy use the potions
[4:04:03] <IvanMistwalker> Pat you have cantrips available
[4:04:06] <+transporterthesequel> Chat just let him learn
[4:04:07] <%Piemono> Potions are worth less than spell slots
[4:04:07] <leinadtonu> always top off your heath
[4:04:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> We all knew it was gonna get patched out @fugly_nick they have some agreement to not have english or any other language speaking to be "international"
[4:04:14] <Visorak6> You will be on the floor if you're not topped up and someone crits you at low levels @PatStaresAt
[4:04:15] <+transporterthesequel> For potion usage
[4:04:19] <%laserbeaming> Scrolls AND Lore
[4:04:21] <chaosbringer28> basic healing potions and wands are litterally there for healing between combat
[4:04:25] <%TheFabledAble> @TheFabledAble I think if someone struggles with when they should cast spells warlock would be a better option. since they get them back on short rest
[4:04:26] <+BigCoffee> SUPERMAN WOULDNT USE THE POTIONS, HE'D KEEP THEM FOR LATER, TO HELP PEOPLE. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO ACT LIKE SUPERMAN????
[4:04:26] <%PlatinumAvacyn> rests are the resource you want to hoard in this game, pat
[4:04:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Every single room you should have full HP.
[4:04:29] <%laserbeaming> surprise round
[4:04:31] <+JJJKopf> they'll probably add in controller support next March
[4:04:31] <chaosbringer28> its basically expected in pathfinder
[4:04:33] <%Ghufufin> time to die
[4:04:33] <%RealThiele> bears endurance Kappa
[4:04:33] <+Shonen_hero> surprise round
[4:04:34] <+Shonen_hero> yeah
[4:04:39] <+JJJKopf> when the console release comes out
[4:04:48] <%laserbeaming> BTW, there's a bug that lets you charge with only one action
[4:04:48] <$mattynezz> You can still Charge in a surprise round
[4:04:58] <%Monkeyweed21> You talk constantly of running out of resources and the game screwing you over and becoming unbeatable. When was the last time in the last 20 years a game has done that?
[4:05:01] <chowndawg> not a bug
[4:05:07] <%Afterman_> @PatStaresAt if you can, you prob wanna walk around in stealth mode, it will let you get a pre-battle attack if you're lucky
[4:05:11] <+BigCoffee> @Monkeyweed21 looo right
[4:05:13] <joodatious> is there stealth in this game?
[4:05:21] <%cooldude69xx> @TheFabledAble That's reasonable.
[4:05:21] <+Shonen_hero> one missed, but not the other
[4:05:31] <akitanito> splat
[4:05:33] <+Shonen_hero> jesus fucking christ Seelah
[4:05:50] <leinadtonu> NO GLORY WITHOUT SPLAT!
[4:05:56] <$mattynezz> Read the Minotaur book, some give you small permanent bonuses
[4:05:57] <Visorak6> Its better
[4:06:03] <+Shonen_hero> yeah straight upgrade
[4:06:08] <mikeriffic> number go up
[4:06:22] <%cooldude69xx> @TheFabledAble Unfortunately the Druid was the 2nd character, his first was a warlock/rogue
[4:06:24] <$mattynezz> right click
[4:06:39] <+transporterthesequel> HE DID, that's it.
[4:06:45] <joodatious> fuck off show what if gives you!
[4:06:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> You did it.
[4:06:48] <$mattynezz> It doesn't, they're just small hidden bonuses
[4:06:49] <joodatious> thats such shit
[4:06:49] <%Nekros4442> It doesnt, you just read it
[4:06:52] <+transporterthesequel> That's all there is to this book, you are thinking about LATER
[4:06:52] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I would rather Pat WRITE the minotaur book
[4:06:57] <+ShoggothLibrarian> It's in Abilities
[4:06:58] <joodatious> "you gained something secret from this book"
[4:06:58] <SolumFuturae> moon2DOIT hail baphomet
[4:07:00] <+DragonArt07> look at character abilities
[4:07:01] <joodatious> absolute trash
[4:07:02] <+Gondab> are we using thaco where lower is better?
[4:07:04] <+JJJKopf> I think it's under abilities
[4:07:21] <joodatious> there should be an option to hold a button to go right to it
[4:07:28] <$mattynezz> Sorry you can see the BONUS, just not which books have bonuses to give
[4:07:29] <%laserbeaming> @Gondab No THAC0, just BAB
[4:07:35] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> But Baphomet is a goat, not a bull
[4:07:39] <+JJJKopf> the most NICHE bonus
[4:07:40] <joodatious> holy shit this sucks
[4:07:40] <akitanito> wait what
[4:07:46] <joodatious> good buff guys
[4:07:48] <chaosbringer28> lel
[4:07:48] <$lotharrio> Means you'd be better with glaives.
[4:07:51] <%sandrews> glaive the weapon?
[4:07:52] <%TheDullaMAN> It's like fake Proficiency
[4:07:52] <mikeriffic> oh no
[4:07:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> You get a +1 to attack and damage with glaives.
[4:07:53] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Literally nothing for you
[4:07:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> It means +1 with Glaive
[4:07:54] <notsoy> it's a bonus to a weapon you don't use
[4:07:55] <%laserbeaming> LUL that text wasn't proof read
[4:07:56] <+transporterthesequel> Means you get +1 bonus to Glaives
[4:07:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> more damage with a glaive?
[4:07:58] <%Piemono> +1 dmg with glaives
[4:07:58] <%cooldude69xx> When you use a glaive, context clues
[4:07:59] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> + damage against glaive users i guess
[4:07:59] <leinadtonu> Improves your attack when you use a glaive
[4:07:59] <vicar_anat> By Glaive, tally-ho!
[4:08:01] <mikeriffic> G L A I V E
[4:08:02] <Visorak6> You're a bit better with glaives
[4:08:02] <+DeadPhoenix3> its a fighter class feature. idk why the fuck they worded it like that
[4:08:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> You ARE the affected creature.
[4:08:04] <+transporterthesequel> You are the affected creature
[4:08:04] <%newtype89> if you use a glave you will gain a bonus on DMG
[4:08:04] <+ScrapKingKeita> The affected creature is who reads it
[4:08:05] <$lotharrio> You're the creature.
[4:08:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you are the creature
[4:08:06] <%Questiy> +1 to glaive
[4:08:06] <Shwepie> +1 when using Glaives.
[4:08:06] <joodatious> if you used glaives you'd be better against them
[4:08:07] <%PlatinumAvacyn> if you use glaive it treats it as if you had a feat for glaives
[4:08:07] <leinadtonu> You are the creature
[4:08:07] <joodatious> IF
[4:08:08] <Visorak6> Affected creature is YOU
[4:08:08] <gyde42> affected creature is you
[4:08:09] <+Vigonept> youre the affected creature?
[4:08:09] <%Nekros4442> Glaive is a weapon
[4:08:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> meaning the creature affected by the book
[4:08:10] <%TheDullaMAN> Creature can mean any living being
[4:08:10] <chaosbringer28> typo, but means it gives +1 to attack and +1 to damage with glaive
[4:08:10] <joodatious> so fuck you
[4:08:11] <$mattynezz> It gives +1 to attack with Glaves
[4:08:11] <%Piemono> You are the affected creature
[4:08:12] <+WeLucklessJacks> Glaives are a type of a weapon.
[4:08:12] <%vaporousTippler> You read it, you are now affected by it.
[4:08:12] <notsoy> YOU are the creature with the ability
[4:08:12] <%Questiy> YOU are the creature
[4:08:13] <akitanito> this text is worse than MTL
[4:08:14] <+DeadPhoenix3> looks like it jsut gives you +1 attack and damage for using a glaive
[4:08:15] <%Nekros4442> and you are the creature
[4:08:16] <chowndawg> +1 to hit and damage if you use a glaive
[4:08:16] <chaosbringer28> you are the affected creature
[4:08:17] <+transporterthesequel> RIGHT!?
[4:08:17] <Badgerconda_> Russia
[4:08:17] <%newtype89> USA
[4:08:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> RUSSIA
[4:08:18] <%sandrews> the affected creature is the reader
[4:08:19] <steve_the_suus> like + 1 Glaive skill as if you did = 1 level of training..?
[4:08:19] <Jimhalla> you are the affected creature
[4:08:19] <+Shonen_hero> Russia
[4:08:20] <$mattynezz> Mosxow
[4:08:20] <terrible35> its pretty explicit
[4:08:21] <Ika1> Russia lol
[4:08:22] <Visorak6> RUSSIA
[4:08:22] <akitanito> russia
[4:08:23] <%Gogogolem> Poland?
[4:08:23] <%Ghufufin> think its +1 to hit and damage with glaives but its written like they had a seizure in the middle
[4:08:24] <+kawachipto> more damage greater chance to hit
[4:08:24] <+boriss96> Russua
[4:08:25] <$lotharrio> Russia HahaBaby
[4:08:25] <leinadtonu> R U S S I A
[4:08:26] <%MugenSandan> I LOVE LAWYER LANGUAGE IN DND BibleThump WutFace ResidentSleeper
[4:08:27] <joodatious> no they aren't
[4:08:28] <+JJJKopf> @PatStaresAt if you attack with a glaive and the enemy has a glaive, you get a +1 to attack and damge. It's fucking niche as fuck
[4:08:28] <alternatecoyote> + 1 modifier on attack & damage rolls with glaives, you are the affected creature
[4:08:28] <+Shonen_hero> Eurojank
[4:08:28] <%Agami23> apply directly to the forehead
[4:08:28] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> that explains it
[4:08:29] <chaosbringer28> russia
[4:08:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> big surprise lol
[4:08:30] <tanarath> +1 to shit when using glaives against minotaurs in this dungeon?
[4:08:31] <terrible35> yeah you
[4:08:31] <UnImprest> dwarf is creature
[4:08:32] <%CatRidder> rusia
[4:08:33] <+EXPsoon> You are the affected creature, you get +1 to glaive
[4:08:35] <Badgerconda_> CYKA
[4:08:37] <+transporterthesequel> GOOD OLE CRUNCHY EUROJANK
[4:08:39] <+JustToWatch> you know what fair enough
[4:08:52] <+transporterthesequel> Also no one better talk shit about SEELAH I will DIE FOR HER.
[4:08:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> They're teeming with sexual energy.
[4:09:00] <$mattynezz> Rage effect
[4:09:03] <Visorak6> Theyre angry
[4:09:04] <+JJJKopf> it's not a bug it's a feature
[4:09:07] <$lotharrio> Maybe a little. Just for fun, to see if they like it.
[4:09:08] <%Reaviar> no theyre not on fire but they are raging
[4:09:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> RIP
[4:09:10] <+transporterthesequel> PFFT
[4:09:10] <akitanito> oof
[4:09:11] <steve_the_suus> exual NRg
[4:09:13] <%CatRidder> they are using pathfinders language
[4:09:16] <Badgerconda_> Thing is, this stuff is easy enough to figure out what they mean IF YOU KNOW THE TABLETOP GAME. But if you don't, the ESL way it's written makes it really hard to figure out
[4:09:16] <+Gondab> Dwarf is a creature just like in ffxiv
[4:09:17] <+transporterthesequel> Gottdam
[4:09:17] <UnImprest> this game is an IQ test in disguise
[4:09:20] <+JustToWatch> tough fight
[4:09:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Can we get some Fs in chat?
[4:09:20] <+kawachipto> but seelah is wet bread
[4:09:27] <%Nekros4442> @joodatious I'm sorry are you just trying to dog on every single thing in the game so you automatically assumed they werent from Russia?
[4:09:39] <%MightyDuckShoes> is Seelah romance Le and is there awkward sex stuff as all biowarish games should?
[4:09:58] <%cooldude69xx> @Nekros4442 They've complained the entire stream
[4:10:13] <joodatious> @Nekros4442 wut? I already knew who made the game dont be so sensitive someone doesnt like shitty stuff in a game
[4:10:17] <gslayer14> xcom luck
[4:10:27] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Can you bash locks?
[4:10:29] <leinadtonu> game's doing its best man
[4:10:30] <%Nekros4442> @joodatious You said the gamedev wasnt from Russia?
[4:10:34] <solazz> oh hell yeah some pat and pathfinder nice
[4:10:37] <+JJJKopf> it will tell you when it breaks
[4:10:37] <%PlatinumAvacyn> this isn't a bioware game wut
[4:10:40] <%bravebravesrobin> Did you hear abo\t the Russian AI robot that turned out to be a guy in a robot costume? Cheer500
[4:10:49] <+DeadPhoenix3> you got the ding already
[4:10:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> @MightyDuckShoes You can't romance Seelah, there is awkward sex stuff.
[4:10:52] <joodatious> I said russia needs to try harder
[4:10:53] <chaosbringer28> probably to make up for that small chance of fail just screwing you over
[4:11:11] <notsoy> i DEFINITELY prefer the auto-20 KOTOR gives you for those non-combat skill checks
[4:11:17] <%cooldude69xx> @Nekros4442 should he be tough and strong lik eyou and complain about a game for three hours?
[4:11:18] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Russia makes the best jank in the world
[4:11:37] <+transporterthesequel> HERE WE GO
[4:11:38] <%Nekros4442> You said "No they arent" right after everyone answered the question about where the dev was from
[4:11:56] <+transporterthesequel> Guys don't feed the troll
[4:11:58] <+BigCoffee> Bane?
[4:12:13] <%cooldude69xx> @BlowFireThroatTotem France is up there too. Ubisoft is almost high quality
[4:12:25] <swansong118> Cantrips?
[4:12:31] <joodatious> @Nekros4442 stop being so damn defensive its a game dude.
[4:12:43] <%MightyDuckShoes> Pat just refuses to understand dwarf speed, huh.
[4:12:58] <joodatious> they have the small legg
[4:12:58] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> @cooldude69xx nice SeemsGood
[4:13:02] <+JJJKopf> make sure to toggle Lann's ability so he's always close enough to get an attack bonus
[4:13:07] <akitanito> he has high defense
[4:13:09] <joodatious> the move less
[4:13:10] <+BigCoffee> you're extra slow
[4:13:11] <commanderapathy> is anyone's stream skipping?
[4:13:12] <Ika1> dwarf slow
[4:13:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dwarves have small legs.
[4:13:13] <Badgerconda_> dwarves move slower than big races
[4:13:14] <%Piemono> Dwarves have less movement
[4:13:14] <%Nekros4442> @joodatious I mean, i'm only calling you out because you seemed to want to straight up lie to make the game look worse
[4:13:14] <%laserbeaming> Dwarves are slow as fuck
[4:13:16] <%AncelDeLambert> that you are short
[4:13:17] <akitanito> short legs less move
[4:13:17] <%BinaryFireball> tiny legs
[4:13:19] <+Shonen_hero> dwarves can be piled with a bunch of heavy equipment
[4:13:20] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Dwarves can only move 20 feet not 30
[4:13:21] <+ShoggothLibrarian> That's it
[4:13:22] <%cooldude69xx> @Nekros4442 You're the only one whos upset. Have been for three hours
[4:13:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[4:13:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> Dwarves have 20 instead of 30 speed
[4:13:26] <+Shonen_hero> and don't deal with encumbrance
[4:13:27] <chaosbringer28> dwarfs move 2/3 the s peed of everyone else
[4:13:28] <%Monkeyweed21> DWARVEs HAVE TINY LEGS
[4:13:30] <$mattynezz> You can cover over an attack in the log on the bottom right to see the actual roll
[4:13:30] <tanarath> Dwarf slow
[4:13:31] <Shwepie> Tiny Pat Legs = Less Fast
[4:13:33] <joodatious> @Nekros4442 when did i lie?
[4:13:34] <$lotharrio> Everyone else moves 30. Patron moves 20
[4:13:34] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> No, like, in terms of comprehension, Pat.
[4:13:35] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt use increments of 5 movement to position yourself for charge, then use charge
[4:13:37] <+Shonen_hero> trade off is ten feet off movement speed
[4:13:38] <%laserbeaming> you can compensate later at super high levels by having a wizard cast Haste
[4:13:46] <%Alazull> He is a champion
[4:13:47] <akitanito> use spells?
[4:13:49] <swordmanegill> Pathfinder? Is this closer to 3.5 or 5e?
[4:13:49] <tanarath> Use charge first
[4:13:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dwarves move less but they carry more.
[4:13:51] <%Monkeyweed21> maybe use your spells
[4:13:54] <%PlatinumAvacyn> bless time
[4:13:56] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt you can use small increments of your movement multiple times in one turn
[4:14:01] <$lotharrio> Bless time?
[4:14:06] <+Shonen_hero> Yeah haste makes things go a lot quicker
[4:14:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> See Pat THIS is why you heal between every fight.
[4:14:08] <%Giantsuperguy> @swordmanegill 3.5
[4:14:10] <chaosbringer28> @swordmanegill 3.5
[4:14:13] <%Monkeyweed21> use a spell?
[4:14:21] <%Alazull> Doesn't need Bless for one guy
[4:14:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Is Bless a spell slot or a cantrip?
[4:14:23] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> @Nekros4442 You said we would always be there for each other doodBait
[4:14:24] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Enjoying the game so far, run into any scary Demons
[4:14:25] <+DeadPhoenix3> sheela can heal during battle with a swift action
[4:14:37] <notsoy> you can use a potion in lieu of a movement action
[4:14:41] <+transporterthesequel> Chat, the mobs name is CHAMPION
[4:14:43] <joodatious> punch him with a spell
[4:14:53] <%laserbeaming> @swordmanegill Pathfinder is usually called 3.75 for a reason
[4:14:53] <+Shonen_hero> Btw, cultists are considered an evil creature type, meaning you can use-- damn you got it already xD
[4:14:59] <chaosbringer28> is the stuff poping up dice vs needed roll or the actual proper AC cause some of those numbers seem low
[4:15:05] <swordmanegill> @chaosbringer28 Does it have grappling?
[4:15:10] <%cooldude69xx> Is flanking a thing in this version?
[4:15:15] <$lotharrio> Dice vs needed I believe
[4:15:19] <+transporterthesequel> YEAH THE BEEF
[4:15:25] <akitanito> pixel hp
[4:15:29] <+Shonen_hero> the numbers that you'll see are kind of inflated for the video game
[4:15:33] <+transporterthesequel> @cooldude69xx Yes flanking is a thing
[4:15:38] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Can't you just all kick him in his nuts and butthole at the same time?
[4:15:39] <+Shonen_hero> magic missle would've helped there
[4:15:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> this ga,me looks like a bad time if you don't play Pathfinder
[4:15:43] <+Shonen_hero> It never misses
[4:15:47] <+Shonen_hero> ever
[4:15:48] <+transporterthesequel> I had a dude survive 5 rounds on one pixel
[4:15:50] <%laserbeaming> @cooldude69xx yes, but it works if you have an ally in any position, not just "flanking"
[4:16:05] <$mattynezz> Flaming is a thing, but it's not directional. Any two characters in attack range count
[4:16:09] <akitanito> they don't really do a good job of teaching you the mechanics in this game
[4:16:09] <notsoy> you have potions and 12 uses of that wand
[4:16:10] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt how many healing potions do you have? you can do the heal trick from KoToR out of combat in this game
[4:16:12] <$mattynezz> Flabking*
[4:16:19] <joodatious> why cant you use them?
[4:16:19] <chaosbringer28> @swordmanegill having not played the game, only seen whats been on stream, probably, since ive seen most of pathfinder's mechanics appear so far, unless you mean pathfinder in general, than yes
[4:16:29] <Visorak6> She's at half HP
[4:16:30] <%Alazull> Plus he
[4:16:31] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> * Flan King
[4:16:33] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt Keep saving
[4:16:33] <%Alazull> is gonna rest
[4:16:34] <%TheDullaMAN> You're Dwarven
[4:16:36] <%Alazull> Really soon
[4:16:39] <%Questiy> Pat, you die in like 2 swings
[4:16:39] <+DeadPhoenix3> your paladin allso has a couple heals they can use per day
[4:16:41] <%TheDullaMAN> You can use the Dwarven stuff
[4:16:44] <terrible35> good luck when you get one shot pat
[4:17:00] <tanarath> Pat, you can use the dwarven axe
[4:17:06] <joodatious> mmm rest
[4:17:07] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt I suppose I'll tell you because chat is being WHINY BABIES. Some things in this dungeon hit very, VERY hard. Which is why they are getting triggered.
[4:17:11] <%Dakuu75> can ppl not chill, and just ya'know... l;et him play the game. sheesh
[4:17:19] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Ah, now that's some oldschool D&D
[4:17:22] <%TheFabledAble> enjoy the corruption of your champions pat
[4:17:25] <%PlatinumAvacyn> you can only rest like this in the tutorial, pat
[4:17:25] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Wasting weeks at a time resting
[4:17:30] <joodatious> fuck she's so annoying
[4:17:31] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> IS that Jimmy Nuetron?
[4:17:34] <%Alazull> Famous last words
[4:17:36] <chaosbringer28> yea you only heal so much in one day
[4:17:36] <+Shonen_hero> whoa Camellia
[4:17:41] <joodatious> someone tell the VA to stop yelling please
[4:17:42] <%Nekros4442> A bit aggressive lady
[4:17:47] <%laserbeaming> @TheFabledAble that mechanic only kicks in after this dungeon
[4:17:50] <%cooldude69xx> @swordmanegill I was wondering about this game. CRPGs usually take shortcuts here and there for convenience
[4:17:52] <fugly_nick> Did they just sit here for two whole days?
[4:17:58] <+JJJKopf> that was you using your healing spells
[4:17:58] <+transporterthesequel> No Camellia needs to KEEP YELLING
[4:18:00] <%PlatinumAvacyn> can only do that in this tutorial pat
[4:18:04] <%TheFabledAble> @TheFabledAble ah
[4:18:07] <%sandrews> oh man Pat was david carridine-ing offf in that corner
[4:18:09] <%TheFabledAble> tutorial dungeon
[4:18:14] <+Shonen_hero> when you rest, there's a toggeable option that lets you use up any spells or abilities that heal you (not consumables)
[4:18:16] <%Agami23> oh yeah, he has some bonus for weapons that have dwarf in the name right?
[4:18:20] <leinadtonu> Chat's helpful, are we not?
[4:18:21] <+JJJKopf> it's almost like the tutorial dungeon doesn't punish the player as much at the full game............
[4:18:21] <tanarath> Did pat open the chest?
[4:18:21] <commanderapathy> so I've played a bit of this game, does every quest have a time limit?
[4:18:27] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Pretty sure Camellia is Jimmy Neutron, Pat
[4:18:28] <joodatious> did they make camellia unlikable on purpose?
[4:18:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah after this dungeon you learn where that stuff comes from and it's not so good.
[4:18:36] <%cooldude69xx> @transporterthesequel Because she is NOT SUSPICIOUS. WOULD A SUSPICIOUS PERSON BE THIS LOUD
[4:18:40] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Just a little something to help with the rule 34, chat
[4:18:40] <+DeadPhoenix3> he doesn't get bonuses to dwarf weapons they are just easy to use
[4:19:08] <%Alazull> ONE SHOT
[4:19:09] <MemAlephh> what difficulty is he playing on
[4:19:11] <%Taisuru> psaDogchamp
[4:19:11] <joodatious> shmach'd
[4:19:15] <+kawachipto> @commanderapathy no, some have a chapter limit, but not really any time limits
[4:19:16] <%laserbeaming> now that's a greatsword hit
[4:19:20] <%cooldude69xx> When Big Stick works, it really works
[4:19:20] <joodatious> @MemAlephh normal
[4:19:24] <+transporterthesequel> Exactly you should always trust Camellia. She's so helpful!
[4:19:33] <%TheFabledAble> too far
[4:19:35] <%YakumoYomi> Gief HATES missed shots
[4:19:36] <%laserbeaming> I think the Bed blocks it
[4:19:37] <+Shonen_hero> No, not every quest. There's three areas in this first act you need to reach quickly. That would be market square, then tower, then library and then curio store. Everything else in the first act is non-time sensitive
[4:19:37] <Profmcstevie> Bork, get the big kills, bork
[4:19:38] <%Taisuru> psaGiefrail
[4:19:40] <+transporterthesequel> IS SHE NOT
[4:19:51] <%AncelDeLambert> get those spiders, Zangief, GETTIM
[4:19:54] <%takotoots> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:19:55] <commanderapathy> @kawachipto so grinding in this game is a no go?
[4:19:57] <terrible35> Gief is playing Bard right now
[4:20:08] <%TheWinged7> no those poor spoders
[4:20:08] <%cooldude69xx> @joodatious Well she's an evil character, and I've never seen one of those done in a not annoying way
[4:20:16] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> She's only super helpful once she has a brain blast. Before then she fucks everything up.
[4:20:18] <fugly_nick> Yare yare Zangief
[4:20:18] <%laserbeaming> I feel like Camellia should have 2 sets of battle quotes, but they didn't have the budget
[4:20:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> She's not evil.
[4:20:19] <huskarl_zap> sus amogus pillow
[4:20:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> She's true neutral.
[4:20:24] <+transporterthesequel> @kawachipto Grinding in this game is going scorched earth on every single thing
[4:20:27] <%Sunriser41> @Shonen_hero yea, pretty much, after tha is only the crusade morale and corruption, and those are easy to mitigate
[4:20:27] <%TheWinged7> oh no, i had to go to a meting what hapened to spoder girl?
[4:20:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> Which is arguably MORE annoying.
[4:20:37] <joodatious> @joodatious uhh what part of evil means annoying?
[4:20:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> Spoder girl ran ahead.
[4:20:39] <%Taisuru> THE BOY
[4:20:44] <+Shonen_hero> You can grind in this game. There's no like main story beats that are timed perse, but you deal with a corruption mechanic that slowly builds over time if you don't rest at your own base. If you rest at home, all that corruption goes away
[4:20:45] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> True CHAOTIC nuetral
[4:20:55] <%TheWinged7> @Too_Much_Nukie phew, ok
[4:20:56] <%Piemono> @TheWinged7 She left after Pat made a decision she didn't agree with
[4:21:02] <+Shonen_hero> and if you let it build you get serious debuffs
[4:21:05] <%Taisuru> Just let the dog stream already it's what we all want
[4:21:10] <commanderapathy> @transporterthesequel that is what I want
[4:21:10] <+kawachipto> @commanderapathy game will tell you when a chapter end quest happens so do as many or as little as you want.
[4:21:12] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Give us some of that good snort ASMR, Pat
[4:21:22] <%cooldude69xx> @joodatious Just the way I've seen it played by PC's. It's always too over the top or sabotaging other players
[4:21:23] <%laserbeaming> @joodatious she's a lot better when she drops the pretension of being a civilized person
[4:21:25] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Aw, he's gone
[4:21:51] <+kawachipto> @commanderapathy ones that need to be done that chapter have an hourglass next to them
[4:22:00] <%Taisuru> Can't charge through part member?
[4:22:00] <%Nekros4442> Seela's foot is in the way
[4:22:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah basically she's like a weirdo spirit worshipper who sacrifices animals and shit and being annoying is how she thinks a "normal" person acts.
[4:22:09] <+transporterthesequel> You'd run into Seelah
[4:22:12] <%cooldude69xx> @Too_Much_Nukie wait, she's really neutral? That's actually suprising
[4:22:12] <fugly_nick> I think Seelah is barely in the way
[4:22:13] <%laserbeaming> if you take a 5-foot step, you can't move
[4:22:13] <joodatious> I can't believe they never fixed the music issue from the first game. looping music is a basic aspect of sound design in video games
[4:22:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> So she's pretending not to be a weirdo.
[4:22:16] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Gonna have to ask you to lay off the heart devoring there, Jimbo
[4:22:17] <+Shonen_hero> you can't move five feet and charge
[4:22:23] <commanderapathy> @kawachipto okay cool, thanks
[4:22:28] <fugly_nick> Patron walked through her just fine though
[4:22:32] <%Monkeyweed21> 5 foot step counts as your move @PatStaresAt
[4:22:35] <akitanito> god she gibbed him
[4:22:36] <%CatRidder> you can't move five feet and charge
[4:22:36] <gslayer14> MEATY. CHUNKS.
[4:22:39] <joodatious> he popped
[4:22:41] <MechaBaphomet> D:
[4:22:41] <terrible35> whoops all gibs
[4:22:42] <%laserbeaming> @cooldude69xx no, she's not Neutral. She's got an amulet that hides her alignment
[4:22:45] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> You know who else exploded, Pat?
[4:22:47] <+kawachipto> @commanderapathy no annoying doom clock like in kingmaker
[4:22:52] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> ...Jesus
[4:22:56] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Dude's HUGE now
[4:23:06] <%Nekros4442> @laserbeaming funny enough if you respec Camilla it pretty much tells you her alignment
[4:23:09] <%cooldude69xx> @laserbeaming Got it, that makes more sense
[4:23:10] <+Shonen_hero> man, there's something really satisfying about the foley noises when killing opponents
[4:23:13] <notsoy> mortal kombat ass
[4:23:24] <+Pendragwn> @Monkeyweed21 Not exactly. You still have your move but you can't use it to move around when you 5 foot step.
[4:23:25] <+transporterthesequel> @BlowFireThroatTotem I heard Jesus was on the Drake album
[4:23:28] <joodatious> can you lower the bark frequency in this game?
[4:23:40] <joodatious> thats good
[4:23:49] <+Shonen_hero> You can? I was not aware of that
[4:23:51] <reasonance> you can also turn it UP
[4:23:51] <commanderapathy> @kawachipto ...........Kingmaker's the one I'm playing
[4:23:53] <+kawachipto> I believe you can turn it off
[4:23:54] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> @transporterthesequel Straight fire psaLiz
[4:23:54] <%laserbeaming> @Nekros4442 I mean, I don't have to check it to know it. Her battle quotes give it away
[4:23:59] <+transporterthesequel> BUT IF YOU LOWERED IT HOW WOULD YOU KNOW CAMILLA IS HELPFUL!?
[4:24:03] <commanderapathy> fuck
[4:24:04] <+Pendragwn> can you INCREASE the bork frequency
[4:24:06] <akitanito> perception + persuasion are always king
[4:24:09] <Profmcstevie> Glad this game took a page out of Bubsy Kappa
[4:24:11] <Ika1> Use it on Seelah?
[4:24:15] <+Shonen_hero> this is a good game to do that then, because there's a lot of areas and items you can miss without a high perception character
[4:24:18] <joodatious> my druid in one of my campaigns has 19 passive perception and its great
[4:24:22] <+kawachipto> @commanderapathy oh lol the game pat is playing is the sequel
[4:24:23] <joodatious> my dm hates it
[4:24:27] <reasonance> bark on every click, just like the good old BG1 days
[4:24:28] <%cooldude69xx> Quick pat heal up!
[4:24:33] <+transporterthesequel> @Pendragwn The Bork frequency is MAX BY DEFAULT
[4:24:44] <%laserbeaming> this dungeon is pretty long for a tutorial dungeon
[4:24:45] <+kawachipto> @commanderapathy then yes the quest are timelocked
[4:24:52] <+Pendragwn> @transporterthesequel CRANK IT HIGHER
[4:24:54] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> My DM doesn't exist. Anyone know where I can find one?
[4:24:55] <+transporterthesequel> JESUS
[4:24:59] <fugly_nick> "Oh, it's just Cultists" - Pat's final words
[4:25:00] <%chance_h> Turns out everyone wants to be a charismatic genius investigator
[4:25:00] <commanderapathy> goddammit
[4:25:01] <%Nekros4442> Always kill the cleric lol
[4:25:01] <akitanito> you cleaved her in two
[4:25:09] <%Alazull> The bench?
[4:25:09] <+Shonen_hero> the bench
[4:25:11] <%laserbeaming> blocked by the chairs
[4:25:17] <akitanito> cultists are just made of plasticine
[4:25:27] <%Alazull> Might be bugged
[4:25:30] <joodatious> why do they walk so slow?
[4:25:33] <commanderapathy> @kawachipto that is SO STUPID
[4:25:36] <+transporterthesequel> WAO
[4:25:36] <%newtype89> charge cant cut corners
[4:25:48] <joodatious> their animations for walking look slowed down
[4:25:50] <%cooldude69xx> @transporterthesequel Everything I learn about this game feels like the design team is learning as they go. Like an engineer who heard about guns and built his own without looking at others first.
[4:25:52] <+transporterthesequel> @joodatious Because that's how turn based dnd works
[4:25:59] <%newtype89> elevation
[4:26:02] <+Shonen_hero> not quite
[4:26:05] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Everyone is plastic sacks filled with paint
[4:26:07] <+DeadPhoenix3> tiny dwarf legs
[4:26:10] <+Shonen_hero> ah elevation
[4:26:11] <akitanito> setting up for charge is better
[4:26:15] <joodatious> @transporterthesequel no it doesn't
[4:26:20] <+BigCoffee> 2 people against 1 dude is flanking
[4:26:20] <joodatious> they are physically moving slow
[4:26:23] <reasonance> if there's another ally nearby = flanked
[4:26:24] <%Gogogolem> Somones next to them
[4:26:24] <Visorak6> Just need two people hitting them
[4:26:25] <%Dakuu75> does this game give you bonus for back-attacks?
[4:26:25] <%AncelDeLambert> in a grid-based game it is
[4:26:25] <%laserbeaming> you always flank if you have two people
[4:26:29] <%Questiy> 2 v 1
[4:26:30] <%Nekros4442> They're flanked if it's 2 v 1 generally
[4:26:31] <%cooldude69xx> Apparently you just need to be in melee with other people
[4:26:31] <%Taisuru> 2 people against 1
[4:26:34] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I mean, flanking is an idea that exists, yes.
[4:26:35] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt Flanking is just bangin with your bro's
[4:26:35] <chowndawg> 2 melee attacking same target
[4:26:41] <%Lefanque> to flank to allies have to be in melee range of the same target
[4:26:43] <$lotharrio> If multiple people are engaged in melee on a target, that target is flanked and they get accuracy bonuses.
[4:26:44] <+Shonen_hero> essentially, if an enemy is engaged with another character and you attack that enemy while engaged in combat, that is considered flanking
[4:26:46] <%Lefanque> two*
[4:26:47] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt If it's usual D&D rules then it just means another party member in melee range
[4:26:48] <+transporterthesequel> you gang up on someone in melee you're flanking
[4:26:49] <%Ghufufin> 2 ppl on opposite sides of an opponent dont know if there is a visiual indicator
[4:26:53] <jamiewine1974> Hi pat
[4:26:54] <%vaporousTippler> There is no "back" of a target in Pathfinder. They face all directions in their space.
[4:26:58] <Badgerconda_> asshole removing rapier +1
[4:27:04] <+Pendragwn> if you can draw a line straight through yourself and them it counts as flanking in the tabletop, but it was just if you had two people in melee in the previous game.
[4:27:04] <akitanito> the physics is ridiculous here
[4:27:06] <%laserbeaming> Rapiers are more likely to crit. 15% chance vs the normal 5%
[4:27:07] <%chance_h> Just 2+ characters in the opponents attack range
[4:27:07] <chowndawg> don't have to be opposite in crpg
[4:27:10] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, look on the bright side, I'm not seeing you have ranged-into-melee debuffs
[4:27:14] <Profmcstevie> Enchanted to do great butt damage
[4:27:16] <luftraumm1> always remember dnd was birthed from war simulation games with battleships
[4:27:19] <gslayer14> skinny dip time
[4:27:19] <+transporterthesequel> @cooldude69xx That is very much the case with this team. This game absolutely is an iteration on Kingmaker
[4:27:19] <%TheDullaMAN> Might be a good idea to look through your loot
[4:27:19] <%CatRidder> magic
[4:27:22] <+Shonen_hero> that's unsanitary
[4:27:28] <%Nekros4442> @AncelDeLambert Oh no, that's there
[4:27:29] <fugly_nick> Oh shit what happened?
[4:27:33] <notsoy> scrolls are just one-use spells, right? a lot of them seem to have dropped
[4:27:34] <+Shonen_hero> think of all the bloodborne pathogens
[4:27:38] <+Shonen_hero> and evil
[4:27:39] <%Nekros4442> @AncelDeLambert You have to a get a feat to nulify shooting into a melee
[4:27:40] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Kiss, kiss, KISS DAT BOY
[4:27:50] <roobanguy> scrolls can be written into spell books too
[4:27:56] <roobanguy> if your an arcane caster
[4:28:01] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Thank you
[4:28:04] <%laserbeaming> @notsoy yes. And Wizards can copy them into their spellbooks. Or witches into their familiars.
[4:28:07] <+DeadPhoenix3> scroll can also be used to teach wizard and some other classes spells
[4:28:19] <L3m0nTwi5t> Hmmm after seeing this I think I'll just wait for Baldur's Gate 3 to be fully released.
[4:28:25] <fugly_nick> Time to sit around for another couple days
[4:28:27] <%cooldude69xx> @transporterthesequel Makes sense I do think they should use references from other successful games with die rolls and turn based combat.
[4:28:33] <+transporterthesequel> AND THEN THEY FUCKED
[4:28:47] <%Alazull> Welcome to why you can't rest all the time
[4:28:52] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL Was he barking at the skellington?
[4:28:56] <%Ches_Neckbeard> what if Gief just really wants to eat Skelmo?
[4:28:58] <%TheDullaMAN> Was he...barking at Buscemi?
[4:29:01] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Or was it Steve?
[4:29:03] <%newtype89> for now
[4:29:07] <%Alazull> It still interrupted your full rest
[4:29:13] <%laserbeaming> he attacked before you would be able to recharge spells
[4:29:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> does that guy have face herpes
[4:29:23] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> It would make sense for Buscemi to anger dogs
[4:29:32] <roobanguy> whats pats class?
[4:29:32] <joodatious> why didnt that guy get a surprise round?
[4:29:33] <%kekkerscrew> Well Picard just got renewed for season 3
[4:29:47] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> OH FUCK
[4:29:49] <notsoy> it's not like pat is ever going to use any of his spells lol
[4:29:51] <joodatious> why?
[4:29:51] <%newtype89> it can be a realy strong enamy that costs you more resorces
[4:29:52] <+transporterthesequel> THERE WAS A SEASON TWO!?
[4:29:55] <%MugenSandan> FATHER I WISH TO PLAY A HALF-ELVEN MONK psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:29:57] <+DeadPhoenix3> they made their perception checks
[4:29:58] <notsoy> so i don't think that part of it will matter
[4:29:58] <%Nekros4442> Picard actually made money?
[4:30:01] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Patrick Stewart is till getting work???
[4:30:02] <%laserbeaming> Later on these random encounters get rough. You can get a fucking Dragon on your Ass.
[4:30:05] <+BigCoffee> Pat jesus please use magic
[4:30:09] <+BigCoffee> or dont play a magic user
[4:30:20] <%thebeargoesHONK> why even play a caster then?
[4:30:21] <joodatious> use cantrips
[4:30:24] <$lotharrio> But what if he needs them... for later?
[4:30:27] <joodatious> thats a good trick
[4:30:31] <%aWanderingKaivo> I mean if your archer one shots people do you even need magic
[4:30:31] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt if you end up at a boss encounter and you still have like 5 casts of bless, you might be over hoarding your spells
[4:30:34] <%Monkeyweed21> but then you never use your spells anyway
[4:30:35] <ErikFeral> bork
[4:30:36] <+transporterthesequel> He bork to THROW
[4:30:37] <R3Roundabout> this is a deeply cursed stream
[4:30:38] <akitanito> gief is telling pat to use spells
[4:30:38] <alternatecoyote> Pathfinder Wrath of the Mind Goblins
[4:30:43] <+BigCoffee> @lotharrio he wont
[4:30:44] <%laserbeaming> good thing he probably won't get to the Wizard or Witch today.
[4:30:44] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL Turn the picture of steve around and see if he stops barking
[4:30:49] <%Agami23> dont you have cantrips in this? or ortandios or whatever they called them?
[4:31:01] <%kekkerscrew> Pat is reminding me of my D&D players who are always afraid to use their stuff in case I'm gonna toss something bigger at them later.  And then they have a hard time with fights they should have walked through
[4:31:01] <+Jack8274> He sounds like he's going to throw up
[4:31:03] <+Pendragwn> stop mocking his borks PepeHands
[4:31:09] <Parapattern> He don't know
[4:31:10] <commanderapathy> gief is big boy
[4:31:13] <%barrakuta371> Zangief: How can this be?!
[4:31:15] <%RealThiele> paige is stuck in the well father
[4:31:16] <%laserbeaming> @Agami23 Cantrips are nearly useless in PF1E. Mostly for utility.
[4:31:19] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Daww... he waits for permission
[4:31:21] <akitanito> because they are fucking cantrips
[4:31:26] <%Piemono> Cantrips are not great in this game
[4:31:28] <+sordcooper> low level you need to be conservative with your spells, but as you progress you get more and more and should throw them around pretty regularly
[4:31:31] <$lotharrio> Mind clouding is basically a stun.
[4:31:36] <chaosbringer28> cantrips are weak, but can be spammed

[4:31:43] <%TheWinged7> i mean guidance is +1d4 on anything
[4:31:44] <joodatious> no firebolt or sacred flame?
[4:31:53] <+xenoboost> this game will not play nice with his mindgoblins
[4:31:54] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Little baby spells for a little baby man
[4:32:08] <%chiazam> Guidance is awesome
[4:32:09] <%Agami23> but they are better than moving and not doing anything but moving
[4:32:10] <+sordcooper> @joodatious thats d&d, not pathfinder
[4:32:22] <@GeneralSCPatton> @thewinged7 Pathfinder Guidance is only +1
[4:32:22] <%laserbeaming> @TheWinged7 Guidance is +1 on a skill check
[4:32:30] <akitanito> pat-sized demons
[4:32:30] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> The sexy kind
[4:32:31] <joodatious> i mean like equivalents to those cantrips
[4:32:41] <%Alazull> Cantrips are about as powerful and useful as something in this game that doesn't consume resources should be
[4:32:48] <joodatious> since those are fine for doing damage when saving spell slots
[4:32:55] <%chance_h> Real gamer time
[4:33:08] <akitanito> cold iron is useful here pat
[4:33:11] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Oh my god, pat STOP MOVING doodBait
[4:33:12] <+DeadPhoenix3> this is where smite is really good
[4:33:19] <+Gondab> 5e is so refined and user friendly it's hard going back to 3.5
[4:33:21] <@PeachSaliva> Pat why no help me
[4:33:24] <joodatious> cantrips should be as viable as a swing of a sword
[4:33:25] <%Agami23> if they are demons, doesent your weapon do extra damage?
[4:33:39] <+DeadPhoenix3> he took off the cold iron weapon
[4:33:42] <@ssjklyco> A wild paige appears
[4:33:42] <%Alazull> @PeachSaliva Too busy fighting the daemons
[4:33:50] <+DeadPhoenix3> it was worth it at the time tbf
[4:33:51] <%kekkerscrew> @joodatious yep that's the point of a cantrip
[4:33:52] <@PeachSaliva> Ah hell
[4:33:53] <+EXPsoon> how lucky you are that you have a cold iron weapon
[4:33:59] <joodatious> smamck
[4:34:09] <%laserbeaming> that (reduced) is bugged
[4:34:14] <%KineticZen> She folded him in half
[4:34:15] <+DeadPhoenix3> this si where you might consider using judgement and smite
[4:34:18] <+transporterthesequel> Turns out Pat is big AND strong
[4:34:20] <+DeadPhoenix3> nevermind
[4:34:41] <%Alazull> Paaaat, Paige might be dying
[4:34:42] <%Nekros4442> No loot. They naked
[4:34:51] <%Agami23> apply directly to the forehead
[4:34:56] <akitanito> just give it all to your character
[4:34:58] <%cooldude69xx> Barkskin? Barkskin is dope
[4:35:04] <+Pendragwn> Being overloaded can reduce your stats
[4:35:05] <+transporterthesequel> Nah this is still very much the tutorial. There are literally only 5 hard fights in here...maybe 6
[4:35:12] <joodatious> break the door down
[4:35:15] <+Dradugun> Dradugun subscribed with Prime. 
[4:35:27] <%laserbeaming> it's not a big deal here, but when you get to the world map the overload will suck
[4:35:27] <%Ixiah> not every character needs to be a kaze no kama Kappa
[4:35:44] <commanderapathy> then break down the walls
[4:35:59] <joodatious> BREAK DOWN THA WAAAALLLS
[4:35:59] <%newtype89> tough fight ahead
[4:36:27] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah Water is bullshit
[4:36:28] <roobanguy> has pat then playing in turn based the entire time or has he been switching between
[4:36:31] <%newtype89> diofacult terain
[4:36:44] <joodatious> oh no ankle deep water
[4:36:54] <fugly_nick> Oh is there a real time mode too?
[4:36:57] <%laserbeaming> I don't think it's difficult terrain
[4:36:59] <SolumFuturae> human's can't swim, be careful
[4:37:00] <Profmcstevie> A puddle?! "cAnT tArGeT tHeM"
[4:37:03] <DSD24> Did you guys know that anyone that has ever drank water has died?
[4:37:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Ankle deep for dwarves is knee deep.
[4:37:06] <roobanguy> you should flip between during trash mobs imo then, you can change between during combat by hitting T
[4:37:07] <%Alazull> I don't know if you've tried running in full clothing in ankle deep water
[4:37:10] <gslayer14> why don't you wait a turn for them  to walk into your range?
[4:37:12] <DSD24> @fugly_nick Yes there is
[4:37:12] <%Alazull> But it would slow you down
[4:37:16] <%newtype89> that is why bless it better
[4:37:20] <notsoy> LOL
[4:37:20] <%thebeargoesHONK> ???????????
[4:37:24] <%Monkeyweed21> REALLY PAT
[4:37:27] <%laserbeaming> but you're going to abuse resting anyway?
[4:37:29] <Berendenn> he cast a spell
[4:37:30] <%Monkeyweed21> IT RECHARGES
[4:37:33] <notsoy> it's generally better to buff, since debuffs can be resisted like that
[4:37:33] <%sandrews> what just happened? Iooked away
[4:37:35] <%thebeargoesHONK> did he bane his own people?
[4:37:35] <Visorak6> ?
[4:37:36] <akitanito> oh shit, what did I miss
[4:37:37] <Berendenn> the number is not allowed to go down
[4:37:38] <+transporterthesequel> CHAT THIS IS DND
[4:37:43] <@ssjklyco> The best cantrip: Reload Save
[4:37:43] <+transporterthesequel> THIS IS HOW THIS WORKS
[4:37:46] <chaosbringer28> wait what happened, i was looking at something else
[4:37:48] <%aWanderingKaivo> does it have overwatch, setting your guy to attack when they come into range?
[4:37:51] <+transporterthesequel> You reload until it's PERFECT
[4:37:58] <roobanguy> he wasted a spell
[4:37:59] <chaosbringer28> oh nvm i realize what he did
[4:38:00] <joodatious> @roobanguy its not always clear what are trash mobs when you haven't played much yet or dont know the encounters
[4:38:18] <%Alazull> WASTED
[4:38:27] <roobanguy> @joodatious thats true enough
[4:38:28] <+transporterthesequel> @aWanderingKaivo You are thinking attacks of opportunities, and yes.
[4:38:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> I can't believe Patron wasted a spell smh.
[4:38:34] <%Agami23> now rest since you have like 3 hp down
[4:38:34] <%Monkeyweed21> but you took damage this time @PatStaresAt
[4:38:48] <+transporterthesequel> he dwarf he big
[4:38:51] <notsoy> encumbrance affects in-combat movement range, right?
[4:38:52] <joodatious> but pat... what if
[4:38:56] <joodatious> you needed more health
[4:38:57] <DSD24> Oh shit I took damage RESET
[4:39:04] <@ssjklyco> There is no stronger spell than QuickLoad
[4:39:05] <DSD24> I can't actually do that
[4:39:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> for melee yeah, I was thinking for range and spells, consuming your turn saying if a dude rounds the corner, I shoot
[4:39:08] <cheapdoc> How is he liking it? if at all?
[4:39:12] <%cooldude69xx> If you reload until things are perfect you barely even have to play, nevermind rest
[4:39:15] <+transporterthesequel> I swear to god there is a fight down here I might have save scummed to not get hit.
[4:39:15] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hell yeah enlarge person
[4:39:21] <Profmcstevie> If only people had the unrelenting compulsion to care for themselves as they did their DnD characters
[4:39:21] <+transporterthesequel> @ssjklyco It's super effective
[4:39:27] <joodatious> embiggen
[4:39:30] <%cooldude69xx> @cheapdoc The mind goblins are too powerful it seems
[4:39:35] <akitanito> big whiff
[4:39:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> Like setting a triggered action. I forget the terminology in tabletop
[4:39:40] <fugly_nick> Patron's got Bites the Dust
[4:39:48] <cheapdoc> @cheapdoc Sounds about right
[4:39:52] <%cooldude69xx> @aWanderingKaivo Readied Action
[4:39:57] <dmtjinni> How Good Is The Writing?
[4:39:57] <joodatious> @aWanderingKaivo holding an action i think
[4:39:58] <+transporterthesequel> To be fair the Pillars 2 stream was worse
[4:40:08] <joodatious> either that or prepared actions
[4:40:10] <%aWanderingKaivo> ah right yeah
[4:40:11] <+MisterAvry> if anyone else listens to NADDPOD, doesn't Pat's character sound like Ulfgar from the first campaign?
[4:40:12] <+transporterthesequel> Pat's goblins have been fairly in check
[4:40:13] <DSD24> That's a big man
[4:40:19] <joodatious> @dmtjinni god awful
[4:40:22] <gasperbpuffn> kratos?
[4:40:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> been a while since I played PF
[4:40:26] <%laserbeaming> it's not very much of a maze, that's right
[4:40:34] <gslayer14> beefster
[4:40:37] <+Shonen_hero> Pat's doing surprisingly well for a guy who was panicking at the start.
[4:40:40] <%moonmintparadise> Most dungeons are not really build as mazes
[4:40:42] <%CatRidder> the mongrols call it a maze but is not
[4:40:46] <DSD24> I think you can even bring this up to Wenduag if you have her with you
[4:40:56] <cheapdoc> Well yeah, it's a dungeon, now where did I leave that dragon
[4:40:59] <%thebeargoesHONK> There is a part of me that desperately wants to see Pat play real D&D/ Pathfinder where he can't cheese the game to remain at constant full health/ max spells
[4:41:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> I want him to say its a big maze in every zone
[4:41:02] <+transporterthesequel> Yes the writing for this 70 hour game has been definitively proven to be terrible in this 5 hour stream.
[4:41:10] <%aWanderingKaivo> like even in an open field. "its a BIG MAZE"
[4:41:40] <gasperbpuffn> which game is better this game or baldurs gate 3?
[4:41:44] <+Shonen_hero> I think the writing is hammy, but I don't think it's bad
[4:41:48] <+Gondab> I've been playing Solasta and it's super accurate 5e
[4:41:59] <%Nekros4442> BG3 isnt even out yet
[4:42:05] <DSD24> @gasperbpuffn Baldur's Gate 3 isn't done yet but this game is really good
[4:42:09] <+MisterAvry> this guy have Ferocity?
[4:42:15] <+MisterAvry> *had
[4:42:16] <%Piemono> @gasperbpuffn Hard to say since BG3 isn't out, but BG is easier to get into
[4:42:16] <gslayer14> put it on
[4:42:19] <cheapdoc> You should put it on and see what happens
[4:42:23] <Berendenn> hes going to have to drink 1 of his 27 cure light wounds
[4:42:28] <Berendenn> itll kill him
[4:42:28] <gslayer14> random magical items never go wrong
[4:42:34] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt Can you do us a gigantic favor? Before the stream ends can you look up some info on Mythic Paths? I want to see your reaction to some of them, lol.
[4:42:41] <roobanguy> go for it
[4:42:44] <gslayer14> do it
[4:42:45] <gasperbpuffn> thank yall for the answers
[4:42:48] <gslayer14> yeeeeeah
[4:42:51] <+transporterthesequel> DO IT
[4:42:54] <roobanguy> see if you can take it off
[4:42:54] <cheapdoc> Your ac went up by 1
[4:42:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> did Pat pick Inquisitor just because of hats
[4:42:55] <%cooldude69xx> @Berendenn No, anything but what they're for!
[4:42:56] <L3m0nTwi5t> BG3 is out, but in early access @Nekros4442 All of Act 1 is playable
[4:42:56] <%Piemono> It did
[4:42:57] <roobanguy> ooh it is
[4:42:57] <+Shonen_hero> look at your AC
[4:42:57] <%newtype89> its a ring of protection
[4:43:00] <%CatRidder> its a ring +1 to ac
[4:43:01] <roobanguy> look at numbers
[4:43:02] <%Piemono> Look at AC
[4:43:02] <%newtype89> look at your AC
[4:43:05] <%Gogogolem> Its unidentified
[4:43:08] <+ShoggothLibrarian> Number go UP
[4:43:11] <%Gogogolem> you gotta have someone look at it.
[4:43:14] <%Nekros4442> @L3m0nTwi5t That means it's not out
[4:43:15] <PwnyB> @aWanderingKaivo Yes, actually.
[4:43:16] <%sandrews> you gotta identify it?
[4:43:24] <chowndawg> his ac went up
[4:43:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> perfect!
[4:43:28] <%CatRidder> because you didnt identify it
[4:43:30] <+transporterthesequel> YES SLEEP HERE IN THE WATER
[4:43:31] <%Alazull> Camp in this pond
[4:43:34] <+MisterAvry> wet camp
[4:43:34] <fugly_nick> Sit in the water for 2 days
[4:43:38] <+Shonen_hero> he doesn't have to identify it to use it
[4:43:39] <DSD24> Wow what a bitch
[4:43:39] <+transporterthesequel> No this is what I need.
[4:43:45] <%Questiy> Check your AC
[4:43:47] <+Shonen_hero> Whoa

[4:43:51] <%cooldude69xx> Not suspicious
[4:43:53] <+transporterthesequel> 3 weekes in the water
[4:43:53] <%Alazull> Aight this bitch is a serial killer
[4:43:53] <joodatious> DID YOU KNOW IM EVIL!!!?????
[4:43:53] <%moonmintparadise> this is literally what you asked for, pat

[4:44:02] <akitanito> resting in water?
[4:44:06] <%Puhff> It's a Ring of Protection. Gives you +1 AC
[4:44:17] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah Lann brings that smoke
[4:44:17] <%Alazull> At least she's hot tho
[4:44:17] <DSD24> Wenduag talks shit to Carmelia too its great
[4:44:19] <tanarath> Totes legit
[4:44:27] <SolumFuturae> LUL
[4:44:27] <+JustToWatch> so does Lann have a dick or a cloaca
[4:44:35] <lbrownthedestroyer> I didnt know this Party was into to GLAMPING
[4:44:37] <commanderapathy> you're annoying is what you are
[4:44:39] <%Monkeyweed21> wow look at all these health potions the game is throwing at you
[4:44:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Lann has two dicks.
[4:44:45] <%cooldude69xx> @JustToWatch 50/50
[4:44:46] <+transporterthesequel> @JustToWatch Yes
[4:44:47] <DSD24> Ah yes the classic Evil but she's hot though
[4:44:51] <cheapdoc> @JustToWatch Yes
[4:44:51] <+Shonen_hero> both
[4:44:55] <notsoy> ooh fancy name
[4:44:56] <%Alazull> That sounds tough
[4:44:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> Sadly Lann is straight. Most companions are player-sexual but Lann isn't one of them.
[4:45:03] <%aWanderingKaivo> 30?
[4:45:03] <+BigCoffee> 30
[4:45:05] <%Piemono> you have 30

[4:45:23] <@ssjklyco> But he could have 31
[4:45:26] <+Shonen_hero> yeah this game will drown you in potions
[4:45:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> WHAT IF I NEED THEM LATER
[4:45:30] <+transporterthesequel> Just put it away chat
[4:45:31] <+childrenofnonation> Why use potions when you can save scum?
[4:45:31] <joodatious> jesus 30?
[4:45:38] <%Nekros4442> yep that's a doorway
[4:45:40] <+transporterthesequel> FIGHT OUR GOBLINS so PAT CAN HAVE HIS.
[4:45:41] <joodatious> might as well be infinite
[4:45:47] <chowndawg> those potions have weight too
[4:45:55] <roobanguy> thats one of the frustrating things about Lann, hes so goddamn fast he can easily block door ways at the begnning of fights
[4:46:05] <+transporterthesequel> Oh it's nothing compared to weapons and armor.
[4:46:07] <fugly_nick> Good Elmo

[4:46:48] <%Nekros4442> They're talking about the door bvehind you
[4:46:48] <%Gogogolem> you're near the dangerous door
[4:46:50] <%thebeargoesHONK> Elmo says "stop being a little B****"
[4:46:51] <+megaman_sentinel> you're in his spot
[4:46:52] <%TheDullaMAN> Not that door, the one you walked too during the battle
[4:46:54] <lbrownthedestroyer> ELMO cast Smite
[4:46:56] <UnsteadyFunk> This music is way too epic for just a bunch of jobbers
[4:47:02] <+DragonArt07> its about something else
[4:47:08] <+transporterthesequel> oh this dude is getting BUFFED
[4:47:13] <%Nekros4442> HE'S A CLERIC, GET HIM
[4:47:15] <+Shonen_hero> baby screm
[4:47:17] <fugly_nick> Patron needs to chill
[4:47:18] <+transporterthesequel> OH NOOO
[4:47:19] <R3Roundabout> Big Meow
[4:47:22] <chaosbringer28> oh shit cleric, priority target
[4:47:22] <joodatious> "out of my way" *slowly walks over to the enemy*
[4:47:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Hand of Hosilla is the buff dude.
[4:47:23] <%chiazam> Hit em with the Spells
[4:47:25] <Profmcstevie> Elmo cease your backseat
[4:47:46] <+Shonen_hero> man you are squishy in these early levels
[4:47:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat I swear to Christ if you don't use the potions after this fight I'll shit your pants.
[4:47:55] <%Alazull> Jobbers
[4:47:56] <+MisterAvry> chop!
[4:48:08] <+Shonen_hero> oh that's good, those hands of his hosilla are pretty beefy
[4:48:10] <+DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt that wasn't the dangerous enemy
[4:48:11] <+transporterthesequel> Chat fight your goblins!
[4:48:13] <roobanguy> there was a note too
[4:48:20] <%Nekros4442> there was a note
[4:48:22] <joodatious> pat never use potions dont listen to them
[4:48:30] <%Alazull> So next door is the tough fight
[4:48:31] <joodatious> you're just stronger and cooler then the haters
[4:48:31] <DSD24> I like this intro dungeon
[4:48:34] <+transporterthesequel> I am desperately fighting mine and losing.
[4:48:49] <DSD24> There's a Water Elemental?
[4:48:53] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a lotta orders
[4:48:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> You never win. You just do a little better each time.
[4:49:03] <+Shonen_hero> I beat my goblins long ago
[4:49:04] <%TheFabledAble> sounds like bosses Ive had
[4:49:06] <%AncelDeLambert> "PS: I am evil"
[4:49:09] <chaosbringer28> yes, relax by the blood pool, its so claming
[4:49:10] <+transporterthesequel> Hosilla be tweet longering people.
[4:49:17] <%Agami23> did pat figure out what that ring does?
[4:49:26] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> brb guys gonna go chill in the blood pool
[4:49:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat just use the potions.
[4:49:29] <%Alazull> lol
[4:49:46] <+Pendragwn> pay you are maxed for potions you need to use them
[4:49:48] <%Alazull> Guys let him play the game his way
[4:49:58] <%Alazull> The man has mindgoblins
[4:49:59] <MemAlephh> cam you cant say that word
[4:50:01] <%AncelDeLambert> dammit, Patron, didn't you read Goblin Hunter! Don't overpolish your armor!
[4:50:03] <%Nekros4442> @Pendragwn He is not maxed. There's no limit other than weight
[4:50:03] <+Pendragwn> pay please
[4:50:07] <roobanguy> 23 hour rest
[4:50:08] <lbrownthedestroyer> the wrong way LUL
[4:50:09] <+Pendragwn> mind goblins deez nuts
[4:50:12] <+Shonen_hero> I mean, on the one hand he should probably use  consumables, but on the other it's nice to hear the banter
[4:50:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> YOU HAVE 30 POTIONS
[4:50:27] <+transporterthesequel> Okay this is legit getting more annoying than Pat not using potions.
[4:50:27] <DSD24> Its cool dialogue too
[4:50:31] <+BigCoffee> YOU HAVE 30 POTIONS
[4:50:32] <+Pendragwn> KEKW
[4:50:33] <@ssjklyco> How dare pat play the video game like a video game
[4:50:37] <JowiJoestar> is resting limited or something?
[4:50:39] <%Nekros4442> Yeah fuck it just do it until you can't rest anymore. You'll have to stop doing it eventually but eventually isnt now
[4:50:42] <MemAlephh> the game will punish you for abusing rest later
[4:50:43] <chowndawg> You will have time contsraints at some point
[4:50:43] <%AncelDeLambert> potions in D&D drop like... well, potions.
[4:50:46] <+gheremy84> Your way is insufferable lol
[4:50:50] <+Pendragwn> We will be 20 hours in and find out some horrible downside
[4:50:51] <%newtype89> your building bad habbits latter on resting to much will cose you issueses
[4:50:51] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Spend a day hanging out in the ankle deep water
[4:50:52] <%Puhff> you'll see :)
[4:50:53] <+GimmMeASammich> Rest now because there is a limiter on it later in the game. Abuse it while you can @PatStaresAt
[4:50:53] <tanarath> Dialogue is worth. it'll be limited later
[4:50:55] <%thebeargoesHONK> We want you to face an actual challenge.  not just cake walk through the game
[4:50:58] <+MisterAvry> do potions give you fun party dialogue?
[4:50:59] <@GeneralSCPatton> Might as well exploit resting during the tutorial, before corruption starts being a thing
[4:51:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> its not a big deal, the game didn't even penalize that one with an encounter
[4:51:05] <+MisterAvry> no
[4:51:07] <%animaturgy> No point in using potions if he doesn't have to, to be fair
[4:51:09] <%Nekros4442> @thebeargoesHONK It's the tutorial
[4:51:11] <reasonance> there's some baked-in instinct for people who played kingmaker to avoid wasting too much time with rests
[4:51:22] <%Questiy> He doesn't need it now, and he'll obviously understand why he can't when the mechanic is actually used.
[4:51:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> unless this game has like an actual time and date system and resting fucks with that wasting time later or something
[4:51:27] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah man the point of these games is to fuckin CHEAT
[4:51:29] <DSD24> Lann is kicking ass
[4:51:31] <+Shonen_hero> I mean, it's fine if Pat abuses the rest mechanic here, it really only matters once you get to the inn
[4:51:33] <%Alazull> @reasonance There will be timed mechanics later
[4:51:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Resting gives corruption later.
[4:51:36] <SolumFuturae> I dunno what it is about D&D but anything adjacent to it brings out a bunch of backseaters
[4:51:39] <+transporterthesequel> Cause one crit can end your run
[4:51:48] <fugly_nick> How can such a little person hold so much anger?
[4:51:53] <+Pendragwn> @SolumFuturae play game good or else Madge
[4:52:04] <%Nekros4442> You should in like...4-5 mins
[4:52:06] <%Alazull> So to some degree he is building bad habits atm but the game clearly let's you know that resting all the time is a bad idea later on
[4:52:06] <%thebeargoesHONK> @Nekros4442 and it's time that could be spent getting further.  resting for a minute every 5 is dull to watch
[4:52:09] <DSD24> Oh god its the worst part of the game whenever 4 people miss in a row
[4:52:16] <+EXPsoon> @PatStaresAt make a quicksave now?
[4:52:25] <+Pendragwn> it's bork infinite climate deluxe
[4:52:37] <+transporterthesequel> Cool story but now I'm gonna insist pat rest after every fight now.
[4:52:45] <%Nekros4442> man rip these perception rolls
[4:52:49] <+Shonen_hero> that's a good chest piece imo
[4:53:05] <%Nekros4442> That wasnt the hard encounter
[4:53:07] <+LazyBumNetwork> Didn’t Pat have five party members earlier?
[4:53:07] <%Questiy> @solumfuturae When a game focuses so much on numbers, people like to tell you how much of those numbers you are wasting, its awful
[4:53:10] <%Alazull> Yep
[4:53:11] <%TheDullaMAN> Yes
[4:53:13] <Hellarussian> the Scary Door
[4:53:18] <DSD24> @LazyBumNetwork One left
[4:53:22] <%Alazull> Water elemental?
[4:53:23] <+transporterthesequel> HERE WE GO
[4:53:24] <Vuilionne> you can go in and out, its ok if its the scary one.
[4:53:30] <roobanguy> buff up
[4:53:34] <lbrownthedestroyer> PatSleepsAt
[4:53:36] <%RonaldMcDownload> wet
[4:53:36] <%aWanderingKaivo> they're wet I know that
[4:53:36] <+Shonen_hero> they are made of water

[4:53:52] <+Dotta5> Weak to Gatorade
[4:53:53] <%AncelDeLambert> BLess up and twat it
[4:53:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> use thunderbolt
[4:53:57] <akitanito> water is bugged out
[4:53:58] <@GeneralSCPatton> DR 5/- HAVE FUN
[4:54:00] <%TheDullaMAN> Buff up, bro
[4:54:05] <+Shonen_hero> those judgements will come in handy in this fight
[4:54:06] <+transporterthesequel> wet socks is VERY inconvenient.
[4:54:13] <DSD24> I like the spell cants
[4:54:14] <%Alazull> Yeah DR 5 is pretty rough
[4:54:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cast Bless this Mess.
[4:54:16] <DSD24> chants
[4:54:18] <%AncelDeLambert> oh it follows you
[4:54:19] <rasamune> F.O.E! F.O.E! F.O.E! F.O.E!
[4:54:21] <fugly_nick> That hurt
[4:54:22] <+transporterthesequel> YEYEYEYEYE
[4:54:24] <lbrownthedestroyer> OUCH
[4:54:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> RIP
[4:54:26] <%Alazull> You probably gonna die
[4:54:26] <%aWanderingKaivo> THAT was painful
[4:54:27] <Hellarussian> hmm
[4:54:33] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, nice hits
[4:54:33] <roobanguy> not evil
[4:54:40] <%Nekros4442> oh damn that was good hits
[4:55:02] <akitanito> heal yourself?
[4:55:02] <dybia> Watch out for splash damage
[4:55:07] <JowiJoestar> it's a water elemental.
[4:55:08] <%AncelDeLambert> ??
[4:55:13] <%Nekros4442> Casting a spell is an action
[4:55:14] <Profmcstevie> Dang that dudes MOIST
[4:55:15] <%Alazull> I mean it's level 8 and you guys are what, level 4 atm?
[4:55:15] <+transporterthesequel> Camilla DODGE tankin
[4:55:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> why does that keep happening, moving and not being able to attack?
[4:55:20] <DSD24> This is a tough one
[4:55:21] <chaosbringer28> Oh shit, large elemental
[4:55:24] <%AncelDeLambert> @dybia BOOOO
[4:55:30] <%Alazull> USE A POTION
[4:55:31] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh same turn as spell cast still
[4:55:31] <roobanguy> lmao
[4:55:34] <%Ragathorne> LUL
[4:55:35] <notsoy> 2d6 and you got 2 LOL
[4:55:39] <%AgniBrandt> Gotta love the dice
[4:55:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> @aWanderingKaivo Pat either moves too far or forgets that casting takes his attack.
[4:55:43] <roobanguy> it activated
[4:55:44] <%RonaldMcDownload> You ever tried to punch water, Pat?
[4:55:52] <DSD24> This Elemental is too slick
[4:55:57] <$Futurecity10> Pain without cock
[4:55:59] <DSD24> Big damage
[4:56:00] <+Shonen_hero> the reason they give you so many potions is that the game secretly rolls how much health you'll get from a potion
[4:56:05] <+DeadPhoenix3> dont forget you judgements
[4:56:06] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah didn't realize the cast was the same turn still
[4:56:08] <tanarath> Need a mace vs water
[4:56:09] <+Shonen_hero> and that can vary
[4:56:13] <+transporterthesequel> BOOM
[4:56:25] <dybia> You're having much better luck than me against this thing
[4:56:25] <+Shonen_hero> honestly? You are doing pretty good with this fight
[4:56:32] <DSD24> He's almost dead Pat!
[4:56:33] <fugly_nick> I believe in you Pat, you got this
[4:56:33] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah Seelah's a Paladin, not a Cleric
[4:56:39] <%AncelDeLambert> have you tried turning on the bilges?
[4:56:43] <%Alazull> Yeah like it's already past half health
[4:56:46] <neon093> I don't normally watch Pat's streams, does the dog normally bark like this?
[4:56:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> its 75% dead, pretty good so far
[4:56:49] <Profmcstevie> Gief AND elmo love to backseat huh, all this heckling
[4:56:58] <DSD24> Carmelia is down
[4:56:59] <chowndawg> lucky damage rolls
[4:57:00] <%AncelDeLambert> man, archer MVP
[4:57:04] <scrumbotime> Lann is really carrying this
[4:57:10] <%Nekros4442> Lann is putting in work
[4:57:13] <+DeadPhoenix3> no idea why people told you to get bane...
[4:57:14] <+transporterthesequel> WOA
[4:57:16] <akitanito> so is it
[4:57:18] <+transporterthesequel> Clutch dodge!!
[4:57:20] <SolumFuturae> Nice
[4:57:20] <DSD24> Thanks Lann
[4:57:23] <+Shonen_hero> Hell yeah Lann
[4:57:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> Nice
[4:57:28] <%Nekros4442> Lann did all that lol
[4:57:29] <%AncelDeLambert> everyone say thank you to the ranged guy
[4:57:31] <DSD24> Honestly Patron was dodging good there
[4:57:32] <PwnyB> Lann is Protagonist?
[4:57:33] <+Shonen_hero> that's a really hard encounter at your level too
[4:57:34] <roobanguy> theres jack shit in there
[4:57:36] <notsoy> lann is hard carrying damn
[4:57:38] <DSD24> Plus he did some good hits
[4:57:40] <fugly_nick> Time to rest for another week
[4:57:43] <%Ragathorne> Lann is MVP this entire game
[4:57:46] <+Shonen_hero> thanks lann, you're so awesome lann
[4:57:47] <DSD24> @PwnyB Nah he's a party member
[4:57:48] <%aWanderingKaivo> just shoot things with arrows enough, that's all you need
[4:57:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> @DeadPhoenix3 Did you see what the elemental rolled? It was a 19 vs an 18 saving throw.
[4:57:51] <lbrownthedestroyer> 31 Potions
[4:57:55] <+transporterthesequel> Lann kinda IS honestly
[4:58:03] <%bigbrothergannon> this is cosy
[4:58:06] <%Alazull> And amulet
[4:58:08] <PwnyB> @DSD24 Apologies. I was being sarcastic. xD
[4:58:13] <+XithrascinXV> is there a command for pat's build here or is he just starting out?
[4:58:17] <%Nekros4442> keep failing the identify checks
[4:58:27] <DSD24> @PwnyB Oh don't apologize man its all good!
[4:58:31] <tanarath> Gonna need a wizard
[4:58:39] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt That potion is gonna come in handy. Protection against Evil when you're fighting demons is clutch
[4:58:43] <%newtype89> the ring is cold resistince
[4:58:54] <+XithrascinXV> need someone with the skill "knowledge arcana"
[4:58:56] <%newtype89> and XP
[4:58:58] <chowndawg> the ring helps with cold spells and effects
[4:58:59] <DSD24> I mean you also got exp
[4:59:07] <+transporterthesequel> YES SLEEP IN THE WET
[4:59:12] <+DragonArt07> XP
[4:59:19] <%YakumoYomi> Some of the enemies in this game seem to be purely for the challenge
[4:59:23] <%AncelDeLambert> scare them with WHAT
[4:59:24] <lbrownthedestroyer> PatSleepsAt
[4:59:30] <@tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to fugly_nick! They have given 501 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:59:35] <+Shonen_hero> be careful of trench rot
[4:59:38] <%SpoonheadInExile> THE WET
[4:59:39] <+XithrascinXV> his ugly face @AncelDeLambert
[4:59:40] <%Jeemukun> I understood that reference
[4:59:46] <gslayer14> the party now has trench-foot.
[4:59:52] <%Alazull> They have got to smell like shit at this point
[4:59:52] <%fugly_nick> @tizz86 Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:59:55] <%twoto858> twoto858 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Thanks for the fun over the past few years!
[4:59:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> sleeping in the wet is how his face got like that
[4:59:58] <+GimmMeASammich> Day 37. Still in the Maze.
[5:00:07] <+Shockrates20XX> Are there any timers on this game, like can you spend too much time resting and miss something?
[5:00:11] <@tizz86> @fugly_nick enjoy!
[5:00:12] <notsoy> you're encumbered from all the shit you're carrying around
[5:00:25] <+transporterthesequel> I have become potions
[5:00:28] <+transporterthesequel> OTHER TORCH
[5:00:28] <DSD24> @Shockrates20XX Nah the only thing is Corruption which is not a thing yet
[5:00:38] <+Shonen_hero> that's main story progress
[5:00:40] <+DragonArt07> go  back
[5:00:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Blood rituals are bad
[5:00:50] <%Reaviar> wrong door
[5:00:52] <+transporterthesequel> blood room
[5:01:13] <%Alazull> Dearest Barbara, I have begun to despair that this maze shall be our graves. We have made camp for three days in the cold and wet. Tend to the children and the farm, for I fear I shall not return
[5:01:14] <DSD24> Is this a Type A blood room or a Type 0
[5:01:18] <+Pendragwn> he's borking out of control
[5:01:20] <+Shonen_hero> man do they use magic to keep that shit from coagulating?
[5:01:27] <%thedankestmeeme> Just clocked out how's the game going?
[5:01:34] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt endless bork infinite climax deluxe
[5:01:39] <%Alazull> @Shonen_hero Probably just salt?
[5:01:39] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[5:01:41] <DSD24> Its a good starter dungeon
[5:01:47] <+Shonen_hero> yeah. I like this dungeon way better then the one you start with in Kingmaker
[5:01:48] <%Puhff> yeah this is a much better start than kingmaker imo
[5:01:49] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah it's a real fun tone setter
[5:01:49] <cheapdoc> Use ALL of the mechanics
[5:01:59] <@GeneralSCPatton> I would say that this game should totally let you Resurrect the prologue dragon, but I bet the demons did some soul-fuckery.
[5:02:05] <DSD24> Kingmaker start was okish
[5:02:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> It seems longer because you've spent 8 months inside
[5:02:22] <+transporterthesequel> @GeneralSCPatton DOT DOT DOT
[5:02:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> @GeneralSCPatton Well, hold onto her scales.
[5:02:36] <joodatious> when do you get to play as rat people?
[5:02:36] <%aWanderingKaivo> Patron just doesn't have enough movement because he's a dwarf, doesn't he
[5:02:39] <+Shonen_hero> not really, they are unique to this dungeon. There's only two hands of Hosilla
[5:02:46] <+Shonen_hero> as a joke I'm sure, cause two hands
[5:02:51] <+transporterthesequel> @GeneralSCPatton Seriously, look up some info on this game, especially mythic classes.
[5:02:59] <chaosbringer28> cleric ability
[5:03:04] <cheapdoc> It looked impressive, but channel negative energy in low level clerics is kindda weak
[5:03:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Or don't and remain unspoiled.
[5:03:36] <+transporterthesequel> Like, I was about a 6 out of 10 before I looked up Mythic class info. Now I'm about a ??? outta 10.
[5:03:47] <%Puhff> EEEEVIL KEY
[5:03:50] <+Shonen_hero> sucks to suck
[5:03:52] <+Shonen_hero> anyway
[5:04:08] <DSD24> These lizards are aholes
[5:04:16] <+transporterthesequel> YES IT IS
[5:04:19] <$Futurecity10> this is an incredibly long tutorial
[5:04:21] <+transporterthesequel> CRIT their faces off
[5:04:22] <+libra_zero> libra_zero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! How're liking the game so far?
[5:04:26] <+transporterthesequel> They don't need them
[5:04:28] <gslayer14> asshole exploding rapier strikes again
[5:04:30] <%aWanderingKaivo> she just stabbed the lizard dynamite its fine
[5:04:30] <cheapdoc> EXPROSION
[5:04:32] <+Shonen_hero> "I'll cut you wide open!" *person explodes*
[5:04:32] <DSD24> I love the instant gib off Crits
[5:04:43] <SolumFuturae> monitor lizards seem a little random
[5:04:47] <%Puhff> @Futurecity10 well it's tutorial AND worldbuilding
[5:04:50] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah there are some rad crit animations
[5:04:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> @transporterthesequel @too_much_nukie Wait, you can actually do that? Now THAT feels like proper high-level play!
[5:05:05] <BenLanBen> guess it would take 500h to finish this game turn based LUL
[5:05:08] <+Shonen_hero> Yeah
[5:05:12] <joodatious> yeah pillers turn based is awful
[5:05:19] <notsoy> FATALITY
[5:05:19] <+DeadPhoenix3> because thsi game is made for turned based
[5:05:19] <SolumFuturae> gibs set to 10
[5:05:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> wasn't turn based in PoE added kind of after the fact? makes sense then
[5:05:20] <maybefalco> bork
[5:05:21] <%AncelDeLambert> I was so sad when I tried to use grenades in PoE2
[5:05:28] <cheapdoc> The turn based is pretty good in both this and kingmaker. Here it's less buggy
[5:05:29] <%AncelDeLambert> god they're useless in turn based
[5:05:32] <DSD24> I bet Carmellia is some Carmilla shit where she just loves bathing in blood
[5:05:43] <+DeadPhoenix3> or rather the core rules are turned based
[5:05:48] <+transporterthesequel> This game is something special when it comes to roleplay fantasy
[5:05:53] <+transporterthesequel> its fucking NUTS
[5:05:55] <%libra_zero> PoE1's turn-based was kinda bad, but I think they improved it a lot in Deadfire
[5:06:02] <%Alazull> Uh...
[5:06:03] <%BinaryFireball> demon
[5:06:08] <+DeadPhoenix3> they only added turned based to kingmaker because it so many people used the mod
[5:06:08] <%RonaldMcDownload> Half-demon
[5:06:10] <joodatious> devil guy
[5:06:10] <%faldin> poe1 had turn based?
[5:06:11] <%Alazull> Demon
[5:06:12] <cheapdoc> A cambion is like a tiefling that is 75% demon
[5:06:13] <chaosbringer28> demon
[5:06:14] <%kekkerscrew> Cambions are bad times
[5:06:18] <chaosbringer28> Half-demon
[5:06:23] <+Shonen_hero> demon, they are the spawn of incubuses
[5:06:25] <%Fooguwu> the opposite of a cantbions
[5:06:31] <lbrownthedestroyer> doesnt rest before boss fight LUL
[5:06:50] <+transporterthesequel> Oh he turned on real time
[5:06:53] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah it's way faster
[5:06:54] <joodatious> these cambion designs are so lame
[5:06:55] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Would you say this is Pat's crowning moment as a self proclaimed "Nasty Boy," chat?
[5:06:55] <%libra_zero> actually I may have misremembered PoE; it's been a while
[5:07:01] <joodatious> where are their wings
[5:07:01] <DSD24> That's why its great that you can swap
[5:07:04] <+transporterthesequel> I faceroll Realtime until I get to a hard fight.
[5:07:17] <+Shonen_hero> yeah for some fights it's better to just go with RtwP and for the tougher fights to go turn based
[5:07:23] <$lotharrio> Pretty sure they are half-demons. As opposed to Tieflings which have demonic blood back in their lineage that suddenly surged up.
[5:07:24] <%TheFabledAble> totally
[5:07:27] <chowndawg> turn base = hard enemies RTWP = easy enemies
[5:07:28] <%redthebaron> i generally just do the turn-based if it is really a hard encounter
[5:07:28] <cheapdoc> You're overencumbered
[5:07:34] <gslayer14> chest?
[5:07:43] <%libra_zero> I think I read somewhere that Real-time is better for clearing out easier enemies
[5:07:44] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> psaGiefrail
[5:07:51] <akitanito> what
[5:07:52] <$yeknomlive> it's cool that you can toggle it mid encounter
[5:08:03] <+DeadPhoenix3> the problem with turned based in this game is that encounters are built for real time so there are tons of small fights that are kinda a waste of time, which in TB mode can be minutes that are only seconds in RT
[5:08:12] <+Shonen_hero> did you know turn-based mode only exists in this game because of a modder for Pathfinder: Kingmaker? Kingmaker didn't start with turn based, but some dude added it and Owlcat thanked the guy
[5:08:14] <+Dotta5> Ayyy, I'm walkin here
[5:08:15] <tanarath> nice
[5:08:19] <+kawachipto> yeah real-time like 90%
[5:08:20] <+Shonen_hero> sent him a little something
[5:08:36] <Catchemall117> @Catchemall117 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[5:08:38] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[5:08:45] <SolumFuturae> LUL
[5:08:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> that's pretty cool
[5:08:48] <Profmcstevie> Based modders
[5:08:49] <+DeadPhoenix3> drops some armor
[5:08:53] <+Shonen_hero> well there you go, the more you know
[5:08:54] <%redthebaron> drop armor
[5:08:55] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt So armor weighs SO FUCKING MUCH
[5:08:57] <%AncelDeLambert> eat the potions
[5:08:59] <+transporterthesequel> Drop that shit
[5:09:00] <+kawachipto> you have too much useless shit
[5:09:00] <%RonaldMcDownload> sort your shit, asshole
[5:09:01] <%Piemono> You're carrying too much shit
[5:09:02] <$Futurecity10> cant wait for someone to patch out carry weight
[5:09:06] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt pat check your weight. you prob carrying like 40 chainmail
[5:09:12] <%redthebaron> you are bound to have like so much shitty armor
[5:09:16] <notsoy> drop the shit-tier armor you're dragging around
[5:09:18] <+DeadPhoenix3> armor is huge but isnt worth much most of the time
[5:09:26] <tanarath> maybe sell your shit?
[5:09:29] <%aWanderingKaivo> what's the red symbol on the portraits for?
[5:09:33] <+kawachipto> you have armor that weighs 50 and is worth 5 gold LUL
[5:09:37] <+transporterthesequel> BORK
[5:09:38] <%libra_zero> I usually just drop just enough weight to exit right at the area transition point
[5:09:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> FLESH PIT HYPE
[5:09:48] <joodatious> @DeadPhoenix3 thats fucking lame and makes no sense
[5:09:59] <RushUnplugged> dwarves be chonky but slow
[5:10:03] <%thebeargoesHONK> dog does not like steve
[5:10:08] <+DeadPhoenix3> what are you talking about it makes perfect sense
[5:10:16] <notsoy> are weapons better in terms of weight vs value?
[5:10:18] <+transporterthesequel> cool good feedback
[5:10:20] <+DeadPhoenix3> you every carry a set of armor in your hands?
[5:10:23] <+transporterthesequel> PUZZLE TIME
[5:10:30] <+Shonen_hero> red symbol means you're overencumbered
[5:10:34] <+transporterthesequel> The answer is in his dungeon btw
[5:10:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> aah lol
[5:10:41] <joodatious> @DeadPhoenix3 why would armor not be worth much
[5:10:41] <+kawachipto> @deadphoenix3 not true, shit tier armor yes, but later game shit gets real nice to sell
[5:10:43] <joodatious> its armor
[5:10:43] <+Dotta5> Giff is Dwarf
[5:10:52] <+Shonen_hero> pat you can drop all this armor, then when you leave the dungeon you will have the option to collect it all
[5:10:57] <terrible35> its shit armor
[5:10:58] <+DeadPhoenix3> so low level adventurers can afford it
[5:11:07] <+Pendragwn> D:
[5:11:11] <+Shonen_hero> mhm ^^
[5:11:13] <+transporterthesequel> Yes that is 100% true
[5:11:13] <joodatious> THEN WHATS THE POINT
[5:11:18] <joodatious> just let you hold the armor
[5:11:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> @DeadPhoenix3 I imagine its probably a weight vs value thing, other things have a better ratio
[5:11:26] <%Afterman_> when you go from one area to another, a loot prompt pops up with EVERY dead body's container
[5:11:32] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt the red on your character portraits means your whole party is encoumbered
[5:11:32] <cheapdoc> It's a puzzle
[5:11:34] <%Piemono> You can pick up all the loot from people you kill when you leave a zone
[5:11:35] <gslayer14> p u z z l e
[5:11:38] <terrible35> armor is almost never worth its weight in gold
[5:11:38] <%TheFabledAble> youre carrying to much junk in your trunk
[5:11:42] <+Shonen_hero> yeah what Afterman said
[5:11:43] <+BigCoffee> Yellow, Blue, Red, Yellow.
[5:11:48] <Explodincatz> man this game is polished jank
[5:11:50] <chowndawg> most of the armor you are carrying is worthless
[5:11:51] <+transporterthesequel> @PatStaresAt The answer is in this dungeon, and we can spoil you if you want
[5:11:58] <+transporterthesequel> OR coffee can do that, lol
[5:12:02] <+kawachipto> LUL
[5:12:04] <MemAlephh> this puzzle gfucking sucks
[5:12:05] <+Vigonept> Spoilers. amazing
[5:12:05] <roobanguy> lmao
[5:12:11] <%vaporousTippler> Paintings in a previous room.
[5:12:11] <amonimis> LUL
[5:12:12] <%Broand> Why'd you just tell him?
[5:12:16] <DSD24> Wow I missed this
[5:12:19] <cheapdoc> Honestly, that just kindda saves time
[5:12:20] <Profmcstevie> Nice self control chat
[5:12:20] <+kawachipto> puzzle is super easy
[5:12:20] <+Shonen_hero> I don't there's a solution presented
[5:12:23] <+DragonArt07> do you want the solution?
[5:12:23] <%Piemono> It's not a great puzzle
[5:12:24] <%Afterman_> this puzzle teaches you to pay attention to the game world
[5:12:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> Why dude
[5:12:26] <%Reaviar> there were pictures earlier in the dungeon that showed the order
[5:12:28] <+emperri> damn yaniel
[5:12:29] <+transporterthesequel> @Explodincatz Yeah its FUCKIN GREAT
[5:12:32] <+BigCoffee> Thre are 4 pictures in another hall that are color coordinated
[5:12:32] <%redthebaron> oh i did not do this
[5:12:34] <%redthebaron> damn
[5:12:34] <%Afterman_> @Shonen_hero there is
[5:12:37] <DSD24> Yaniel is a bootleg version of Daniel
[5:12:39] <+DragonArt07> paintings
[5:12:47] <+Dotta5> The sword can wipe your ass
[5:12:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @Reaviar then yes that saves time
[5:13:03] <notsoy> use the sorting options, the empty bar at the top under the icons
[5:13:05] <+transporterthesequel> By the way, KEEP THAT SWORD
[5:13:08] <%redthebaron> cold iron it is fine
[5:13:09] <+kawachipto> sword is alright. can get upgraded a few times later
[5:13:10] <+transporterthesequel> LIKE, REAL FUCKING TALK
[5:13:11] <+BigCoffee> it evolves during the entire campaign
[5:13:13] <cheapdoc> Compared to a dinky longsword, yeah
[5:13:16] <akitanito> better than a basic longsword
[5:13:18] <%Piemono> Just hold onto it, there's story stuff with it later
[5:13:19] <+DeadPhoenix3> its an upgrade for her
[5:13:27] <+transporterthesequel> you should have listen to Seelah nerd out about it.
[5:13:27] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Is this a full playthrough or a one-off?
[5:13:34] <+Shonen_hero> it also can be upgraded later along the way
[5:13:34] <%libra_zero> keep all uniquely named items forever
[5:13:36] <%Alazull> Sounds like something that needs to be restored
[5:13:39] <%NopeBadguy> WHAT HE DO
[5:13:39] <cheapdoc> What is he doing?
[5:13:41] <%Alazull> To it's full power
[5:13:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> ah yeh armor clipping
[5:13:46] <%AncelDeLambert> is he eating the pillow?
[5:13:46] <%NopeBadguy> WHAT HE DO THO
[5:13:51] <%AncelDeLambert> eat da pillow
[5:14:01] <tanarath> What's the dog doin?
[5:14:02] <$Futurecity10> I'll be honest none of these party members are interesting. No NPC's will ever match the hype that is Minsc or Keldorn
[5:14:07] <joodatious> why are you rewarding him for it?
[5:14:15] <%NopeBadguy> GRAB THE BOI
[5:14:15] <akitanito> betrayal
[5:14:16] <%redthebaron> baby
[5:14:19] <+emperri> settle down mandark
[5:14:25] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Is this a full playthrough or a one-off?
[5:14:25] <%YakumoYomi> Kiss burgers
[5:14:26] <joodatious> pigdog
[5:14:37] <joodatious> oh it just makes it look like you're rewarding him
[5:14:41] <tanarath> what a pigdog
[5:14:43] <$Futurecity10> @NopeBadguy one off
[5:14:47] <%Fooguwu> No, you're rewarding him. Should read a book on training
[5:14:53] <+Shonen_hero> It sounds like this isn't stressing you out as much. It was probably smart to start on normal
[5:14:59] <+MisterAvry> make dog do tricks make good dog
[5:15:01] <%Fooguwu> I can recommend "Don't Shoot The Dog"
[5:15:02] <%NopeBadguy> Aw, that's a shame. I'd like to see more of this.
[5:15:09] <+Shonen_hero> I played on Unfair and that shit's hard
[5:15:15] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah Normal is fucking HARD ENOUGH in Pathfinder
[5:15:21] <+transporterthesequel> YEAH it's FUCKED
[5:15:23] <Profmcstevie> Name of difficulty checks out
[5:15:26] <%NopeBadguy> LMAO
[5:15:26] <+emperri> funfair
[5:15:28] <joodatious> eh the story is kinda too bland to bother doing a full lp
[5:15:30] <%AyotoCorp> Unfair is fucking accurate
[5:15:32] <+BigCoffee> unfair is for minmaxers who break the game
[5:15:32] <$mattynezz> it's not fun
[5:15:34] <+Vigonept> its because these type of games do shit for views for pat
[5:15:38] <+Shonen_hero> I figured
[5:15:39] <%Piemono> This would take months
[5:15:40] <%Alazull> Game isn't finished
[5:15:47] <+transporterthesequel> You are almost there
[5:15:48] <+BigCoffee> You're almost done
[5:15:50] <%Afterman_> dungeon almost
[5:15:51] <%Afterman_> done
[5:15:52] <$mattynezz> Your at the end
[5:15:53] <+transporterthesequel> Also the game IS finished
[5:15:53] <+Shonen_hero> you're almost done with it
[5:15:54] <DSD24> I mean the game hasn't even started rolling yet
[5:15:55] <+Pendragwn> guess you'll do it forever
[5:16:07] <+Vigonept> wait jts full release and its not finished?
[5:16:11] <%libra_zero> I believe you've just about finished the dungeon
[5:16:13] <%Alazull> @transporterthesequel Oh all the DLC is out for it?
[5:16:15] <+kawachipto> still only intro
[5:16:16] <%Fooguwu> He needs crate training
[5:16:18] <+DragonArt07> you turned unfair on
[5:16:20] <joodatious> how is the game not finished its released?
[5:16:27] <+gheremy84> Then why not use the goddamn potions?
[5:16:29] <leinadtonu> electroshocks?
[5:16:29] <+DragonArt07> unfair is on
[5:16:34] <$Futurecity10> crate trainers can go to hell
[5:16:39] <%redthebaron> you are extremelly close to ending this dungeon
[5:16:40] <rasamune> Are we backseating his fucking dog now lmao
[5:16:41] <+DeadPhoenix3> finally pat can camp
[5:16:44] <notsoy> wth are you talking about lol
[5:16:45] <$mattynezz> NOW you should rest
[5:16:47] <gslayer14> you should turn unfair on
[5:16:48] <%aWanderingKaivo> saw some people saying there are nasty bugs
[5:16:49] <+transporterthesequel> @Alazull That's...that's not what finished means....
[5:16:52] <%SirGO0SE> fuck crates and crate training
[5:16:52] <gslayer14> just to see
[5:16:55] <amonimis> LUL
[5:16:56] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[5:17:06] <Gorshum> LUL
[5:17:07] <%faldin> people are weird about pets
[5:17:09] <%Fooguwu> @Futurecity10 you misunderstand what crate training is. It's 100% ethical and good for a dog
[5:17:12] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[5:17:14] <%Alazull> @transporterthesequel You obviously missed that episode of the podcast bud
[5:17:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> Backseating the very concept of backseating
[5:17:17] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Pat feel bad for existing
[5:17:18] <joodatious> how dare you love and care for a dog you monster!
[5:17:18] <tanarath> I'm not sure crates are a good idea...
[5:17:19] <%kekkerscrew> Trying to make you feel bad about dog breeds being a thing
[5:17:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> imagine if you guys had a kid
[5:17:22] <Maids4lyfe> backseating dogs wtf
[5:17:23] <%Monkeyweed21> I could be a way better dog
[5:17:23] <UnsteadyFunk> People watched one episode of the Dog Whisperer two years ago and suddenly they're experts on animal behavior lol
[5:17:30] <%aWanderingKaivo> don't you see, if a dog does anything at all its because you let it contract a horrible disease
[5:17:32] <%Agami23> pat, didnt you literally just get him to a vet where they said he is insanely healthy?
[5:17:33] <leinadtonu> everyone is an expert on the internet
[5:17:34] <%thebeargoesHONK> how dare you not evolve your dog into dogchu
[5:17:35] <Vermillion129> backseating dog LUL
[5:17:36] <+MisterAvry> Parasocial dweebs will backseat everything about the life of their target
[5:17:36] <commanderapathy> opinions are like assholes, everybody has one
[5:17:37] <%Fooguwu> None of you seem to know what crate training actually is
[5:17:38] <tanarath> You & Paige are probably smart.
[5:17:43] <gslayer14> they're like judgemental aunts
[5:17:45] <+Shonen_hero> those people need to stay on the Dog Free subreddit
[5:17:51] <%SpoonheadInExile> People giving you shit because you didn't get some abused, reticent, damaged goods that'll bite your GF's face off...
[5:17:51] <+VTJ64> Imagine parasocializing someone elses pet.
[5:17:51] <$Futurecity10> @Fooguwu I've had 3 big dogs in my life and they've never needed it. Maybe raise your dogs better
[5:17:54] <@ssjklyco> Remember when they said he would always jump into your lap when he got older?

[5:18:36] <%bravebravesrobin> dog gives you like 80% of your revenue; NOW LETS SEE GOOD BOY!
[5:18:42] <%AncelDeLambert> I swear to god if you guys start arguing about dog training I am going to turn myself into a mod and then ban you
[5:18:42] <DSD24> Ouch
[5:18:49] <%redthebaron> that dude ate shit
[5:18:50] <%Fooguwu> @Futurecity10 maybe you didn't "need it", sure, but you seem to think it's something bad or cruel
[5:18:51] <%libra_zero> oh boy time for cannibalism
[5:18:53] <leinadtonu> I have no idea what crate training is. Does the dog learn to solve puzzles by pushing crates?
[5:18:59] <$lotharrio> @lotharrio Ah shit that's funny as hell.
[5:19:04] <%redthebaron> eat the blessed MEAT
[5:19:06] <+Shonen_hero> maybe

[5:19:24] <tanarath> Shadow puzzle training
[5:19:33] <%thebeargoesHONK> @AncelDeLambert but Pat needs to make sure he grinds the correct EV's so Geif is tournament ready
[5:19:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> Now THAT is an alignment change
[5:19:38] <%AncelDeLambert> ah fuck, that guys perma-dead then
[5:19:41] <joodatious> why didn't they have text boxes for their convo with the demon?
[5:19:42] <%bravebravesrobin> Crate training is essentially teaching them to sleep in a single spot at night
[5:19:43] <DSD24> Oh shit the DT?

[5:20:29] <%bravebravesrobin> AGAINSY THE MACHINE!
[5:20:30] <+DragonArt07> go demon for options
[5:20:35] <DSD24> Uh oh the upset
[5:20:38] <+DragonArt07> YES!
[5:20:47] <joodatious> I feel like visually this game is very nice but everything to do with the audio design is absolute trash
[5:20:47] <Parapattern> YEYEYE
[5:20:50] <%AncelDeLambert> since that guy was an Aasimar, his body and his soul are kinda the same thing so he's super mega dead now
[5:20:53] <%Fooguwu> @PatStaresAt hope i didnt backseat too hard, it came up is all and as a dog trainer I think of these things 😅
[5:20:54] <+KlorikonWilds> i think its skipping dialog
[5:21:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> I can't believe Wendaug triple crossed.
[5:21:16] <%libra_zero> they're busy digesting their meal
[5:21:23] <%GIGA255> chandelier braziers. so fancy.
[5:21:31] <gslayer14> like bane?
[5:21:35] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I can appreciate Wendigo being like "Nah y'all pussies I'm sticking with the dwarf"
[5:21:36] <+kawachipto> those aren't hostile...
[5:21:38] <%redthebaron> i think if you do the angel thing instead the spider lady does not triple cross
[5:21:40] <$mattynezz> They aren't hostile
[5:21:40] <Vermillion129> Just fireball
[5:21:42] <%bravebravesrobin> @fooguwu. is my analysis correct about crates?
[5:21:42] <+DeadPhoenix3> the spirit hunter has burning hands
[5:21:54] <%libra_zero> they're not enemies Pat
[5:21:59] <%AncelDeLambert> let's put some more fire on their fire
[5:22:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @redthebaron This is incorrect.
[5:22:02] <leinadtonu> sometimes chat forgets Pat is having a conversation with hundreds of people at the same time.
[5:22:08] <+transporterthesequel> nah one got it.
[5:22:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> they aren't even in the fight
[5:22:09] <+DeadPhoenix3> no 2 failed
[5:22:09] <%Monkeyweed21> they arent enemies @PatStaresAt
[5:22:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> Pat, as a proud owner of 3 differently-sized doggos, you clearly don't smooch Zangief's burgers enough.
[5:22:12] <+kawachipto> They aren't enemies
[5:22:13] <+MisterAvry> no, 2 failed
[5:22:13] <%AncelDeLambert> they appear to be MADE of fire
[5:22:14] <DSD24> They aren't enemies Pat
[5:22:18] <+Shonen_hero> they are not interactable
[5:22:20] <$lotharrio> Aren't those ones neutral right now?
[5:22:21] <%TheFabledAble> if you chose the angelic path wendigo betrays you. basically any good action she sees as inherently weak
[5:22:22] <$mattynezz> Pat's violence can no longer be contained
[5:22:23] <Profmcstevie> CurseLit Nice try I dodged it CurseLit
[5:22:24] <joodatious> they're literally eating people
[5:22:27] <%AncelDeLambert> how can they NOT be enemies?
[5:22:30] <DSD24> Oh it super is
[5:22:32] <+DeadPhoenix3> lol that also an inquisitor
[5:22:37] <joodatious> but they're eating people!
[5:22:41] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Well, I gotta go, chat. Glad you found your new favorite game, Pat. Laters psaDab psaDab_HF
[5:22:50] <+transporterthesequel> CRIT
[5:22:51] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah I'd expect burning cannibals to be enemies but eh
[5:22:52] <$lotharrio> Neutral right now.
[5:22:53] <+MisterAvry> nice crit
[5:22:55] <Vermillion129> damn pat why so angry
[5:22:57] <joodatious> its embarrassing how common the music issue is
[5:22:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Demon > Angel
[5:23:02] <DSD24> More demons
[5:23:05] <joodatious> all you have to do is LOOP the music
[5:23:05] <+vaultzombie> sounded like an oblivion guard lmao
[5:23:05] <leinadtonu> inquisit them harder Pat!
[5:23:11] <akitanito> that begging animation lol
[5:23:12] <+Left_Justified> atpHarada
[5:23:18] <%libra_zero> So fun fact: in this second phase I insta-killed Hosilia with a crit from Seela
[5:23:24] <%GIGA255> tekken tactics
[5:23:39] <joodatious> tekken crpg when
[5:23:53] <Profmcstevie> This is truly just fancy Tekken Force
[5:23:55] <%Fooguwu> @bravebravesrobin That can be part of it, but it's purpose is much larger. It's a tool for many things. For example, it's a way to have an ethical and effective "non punishment". It becomes stuff like, for example, the dog learns that if he tries to get in the trash he's "asking" to go to his crate. Just how dogs ask for all kinds of stuff, the dog just thinks bad behaviors are a way to ask to go there. And dogs dont dislike crates, they are cozy for dogs
[5:23:58] <DSD24> So hellsweep just kills everyone?
[5:23:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> Blood for the blood spirits!
[5:24:04] <gslayer14> mmm, that crit for 1
[5:24:05] <%GIGA255> tekken: like a dragon
[5:24:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> was that a crit for 1
[5:24:06] <joodatious> what class is the spider lady?
[5:24:13] <+MisterAvry> these were supposed to be guards?
[5:24:24] <DSD24> @joodatious She's a Fighter
[5:24:35] <+Lv1ange> @joodatious fighter base.
[5:24:37] <+transporterthesequel> @joodatious I thought I saw fighter?
[5:24:48] <%Fooguwu> The dog doesn't even need to stay in the crate, you can let them out after like 10 seconds @bravebravesrobin
[5:24:57] <%libra_zero> oh god she believes that eating people gives you their strength
[5:24:58] <+Shonen_hero> of course this bitch eats people
[5:25:04] <%bravebravesrobin> @fooguwu that makes sense too; thanks for the greater context
[5:25:08] <joodatious> the younglings!
[5:25:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Maybe don't turn children into cannibals.
[5:25:26] <+Vigonept> Oh so she was a fuck nice
[5:25:26] <joodatious> not eating people?
[5:25:27] <+Shonen_hero> not eat people?
[5:25:29] <%redthebaron> @Too_Much_Nukie i just checked the wiki says that if you pick the angel one and showed the light to chief it seems she will still fight for her old boss but if you pick demon she always double crosses
[5:25:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> That seems like a bad-to-do.
[5:25:41] <Profmcstevie> I was giving them evil powers, what were YOOUUU doing
[5:25:44] <%The_Protagonist> consume the children to gain their youth
[5:25:59] <%AncelDeLambert> "young guys and girls" lol
[5:26:02] <akitanito> "I min-maxed and went with an illegal build!"
[5:26:03] <%kekkerscrew> young guys and girls?
[5:26:04] <%AncelDeLambert> that dialogue aint helping him
[5:26:04] <%Fooguwu> @bravebravesrobin np. i wish more people understood it, im shocked how many people think it's unethical. are they thinking about people who leave their dogs in crates all day?
[5:26:09] <MemAlephh> ITS SOOOO BAD
[5:26:09] <%aWanderingKaivo> odd writing
[5:26:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> What an odd line
[5:26:11] <DSD24> Wenduag sounds great though
[5:26:13] <%libra_zero> it works better the less he's given to say in one burst
[5:26:13] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah
[5:26:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Too_Much_Nukie There must be other flags involved then because I chose angel there and she still fought with me and joined the party.
[5:26:19] <+vaultzombie> House of the Dead 2 type acting
[5:26:20] <+Shonen_hero> the voice acting is goofy, I love it
[5:26:24] <joodatious> to be fair this writing is awful
[5:26:25] <PwnyB> Nah, that's just a weird line. I like his voice.
[5:26:25] <%The_Protagonist> "and i didn't become an animal" I mean... kinda sounds like you did
[5:26:38] <rasamune> PERHAPS THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF ALL RELIGIONS
[5:26:49] <%CopperTucker> what A MANsion
[5:26:51] <%Fooguwu> @Futurecity10 hope you saw my explanation too
[5:26:51] <DSD24> Aww yeah Wenduag team up
[5:27:02] <%TheFabledAble> she betrayed two groups before you. why the fuck would you trust her
[5:27:08] <%SpoonheadInExile> Pat, Silent Hill 2's VA is shit, and the only reason you like it is cuz you were young and didn't know any better.
[5:27:09] <MemAlephh> ngl when i was looking at the list of companions lann was my favorite and as soon as i heard him talk i changed my mind
[5:27:17] <%Alazull> I mean could this be any clearer who is aligned to Angel or Demon path
[5:27:21] <Vermillion129> Hey pat, hope you are enjoying WOTR and didnt find too many bugs
[5:27:27] <Profmcstevie> Know betrayer asks for trust, shocked at rejection
[5:27:29] <$lotharrio> Big tiddy goth-spider-car-mommy. uwu
[5:27:34] <%bravebravesrobin> @fooguwu I'll never understood that; we've always crate trained our dogs, and they don't even stay In the crates after the training
[5:27:35] <+kawachipto> @thefabledable simple, she wants the d
[5:27:36] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[5:27:38] <+Dotta5> yet...
[5:27:38] <%KineticZen> Be a bit plainer and simpler
[5:27:42] <%SirGO0SE> damn chat is spicy tonight
[5:27:43] <%SpoonheadInExile> I'm not defenting this game at all
[5:27:45] <amonimis> LUL
[5:27:47] <%Agami23> also bad voice acting is fun
[5:27:51] <+transporterthesequel> NO PAT KILL
[5:27:52] <%thebeargoesHONK> i hope he punches the spider
[5:27:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> @MemAlephh Pretty much yeah. Lann's dialogue sucks ass but he's good in terms of gameplay.
[5:27:58] <+MisterAvry> bro, you are NOT allowed to have opinions are you?
[5:27:58] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @lotharrio uhhhhhh
[5:27:59] <+transporterthesequel> KILL PAT FOR OPINION
[5:27:59] <%Puhff> maybe you should punch a baby in the mouth
[5:27:59] <leinadtonu> Lann's mom in chat. cool
[5:28:01] <Profmcstevie> James Sunderland sounds like a normal ass person, so I think it works
[5:28:01] <%KaiserMario> Wow, that's some bitchin
[5:28:03] <%The_Protagonist> @PlainSimpleTailor so what was even the point of making the comparison?
[5:28:05] <joodatious> but pat you could punch a baby in the mouth
[5:28:07] <akitanito> of course camellia
[5:28:09] <joodatious> you are stronger then them
[5:28:12] <%GIGA255> i like the wind waker route of text accompanied by character-specific grunts and noises
[5:28:12] <%Alazull> I mean Pat has a pretty long streak of choosing blue chick
[5:28:12] <%SpoonheadInExile> OH, but Banjo Kazooie though, right Pat
[5:28:15] <$mattynezz> Lies, Pat is a known baby puncher
[5:28:15] <amonimis> bad voice acting can be better than good voice acting sometimes tbqh
[5:28:16] <+Vigonept> what if they were the voice actor oh no
[5:28:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> Does tabletop stuff summon everyone's inner anger?
[5:28:19] <%TheWinged7> oof Camellia
[5:28:19] <%libra_zero> Lann's WAY STRONGER than Wenduag tho
[5:28:23] <%athuramn> lol chats so special today
[5:28:30] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Is this bitch Virgil?
[5:28:30] <+emperri> can you not just kill her
[5:28:33] <%thebeargoesHONK> spider pussy?
[5:28:34] <notsoy> lann kicked way more ass than this bitch lmao
[5:28:34] <+Vigonept> RACIST
[5:28:36] <RushUnplugged> "I'm gonna be a cunt for no reason and act defensive when called out about it"
[5:28:39] <%redthebaron> lann is so both it unreal
[5:28:40] <joodatious> its not even close too
[5:28:41] <%GIGA255> is she wifi?
[5:28:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's very bad.
[5:28:42] <%Alazull> KILL HER
[5:28:42] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Just stop having opinions
[5:28:44] <%KineticZen> There are different types of bad VA though
[5:28:45] <%Piemono> Fighters are kinda meh
[5:28:45] <%redthebaron> buff
[5:28:46] <+emperri> kill her
[5:28:47] <%Fooguwu> @bravebravesrobin yeah it's just a training tool mostly, i've only sent my dog to his crate like twice in the last 3 years cuz his training is already solid from using it
[5:28:48] <%TheFabledAble> yea shes like half as good xD
[5:28:53] <MemAlephh> imagine choosing crpg companions based on combat viability and not just choosing your favorites LUL
[5:28:54] <+kawachipto> she's not bad, it's just lann is busted
[5:28:55] <notsoy> er, i think you clicked the wrong one
[5:28:57] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh cool she cutscene escapes
[5:29:02] <%KineticZen> welp
[5:29:02] <+emperri> LUL
[5:29:03] <%greasypete00> holy shit this is a long stream huh
[5:29:04] <gslayer14> [backflips off stage]
[5:29:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> The only reason to keep Wendaug is if you're evil. Or if you're a pervert who wants to fuck a spider lady.
[5:29:08] <%AncelDeLambert> plot armor, baby
[5:29:09] <akitanito> she's a spooder
[5:29:10] <DSD24> Wenduag is good gameplay wise though
[5:29:10] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Damn we got outplayed
[5:29:10] <+transporterthesequel> No she does that with both choices
[5:29:11] <+VTJ64> can't kill the dmpc yet
[5:29:11] <%The_Protagonist> WHEELS HUMSING UPLANDER DOOM
[5:29:12] <illTemperedSeaBass> Awful
[5:29:13] <%KineticZen> Thanks invisible DM
[5:29:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> that's definitely how that works in tabletop lol
[5:29:17] <%redthebaron> lann was the only person who even tried to catch her
[5:29:17] <Vermillion129> run like the wind
[5:29:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> rogues man
[5:29:18] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> he tried his best
[5:29:19] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> She used the stage right on us
[5:29:20] <DSD24> Its just Lann is OP
[5:29:20] <cheapdoc> That plot armor is thicc
[5:29:21] <sun312772> god she's ho
[5:29:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> She will indeed.
[5:29:23] <%libra_zero> based narrative contrivance
[5:29:26] <leinadtonu> I made wendu into a cavlier, she is quite useful.
[5:29:27] <%kekkerscrew> She just ran up the stairs.  We can still get her
[5:29:29] <$lotharrio> Wenduag's a Fighter. She'll get feats out the butt.
[5:29:29] <+transporterthesequel> VERGIL INTENSIFIES
[5:29:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Next time i wont miss
[5:29:35] <+kawachipto> her dialog is much better tho
[5:29:36] <%redthebaron> we did it folks
[5:29:37] <tanarath> Yeah, gms man. They handwave
[5:29:43] <@ssjklyco> Game defeated
[5:29:44] <%KineticZen> Good job beting donjon
[5:29:45] <+Vigonept> no pat it was a talk no jutsu
[5:29:49] <%redthebaron> no signal
[5:29:49] <$mattynezz> LUL
[5:29:50] <%redthebaron> this was good
[5:29:53] <Visorak6> Thoughts, pat?
[5:29:56] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> You...did it
[5:29:56] <joodatious> neat stream
[5:29:57] <%NopeBadguy> i'm kinda sad we wont' see more of this
[5:29:58] <%Puhff> LUL
[5:30:00] <+transporterthesequel> GAME DEFEATED
[5:30:00] <leinadtonu> I had funs
[5:30:01] <R3Roundabout> Don't play more of this
[5:30:01] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> it was ok
[5:30:01] <%Agami23> it was good but frustrating.
[5:30:03] <%bravebravesrobin> "but next time..." *shakes fist*
[5:30:08] <Visorak6> Oh kingmaker is WAY worse
[5:30:09] <+Dotta5> Cheers Pat, fun times
[5:30:09] <%Puhff> RIP Dwarf Inquisitor
[5:30:15] <+Vigonept> next time?
[5:30:15] <%GIGA255> i want to see a game where an important villain dies in an altercation completely unrelated to the main plot and flips the script upside down.
[5:30:19] <%Monkeyweed21> pat had fun despite psaGoblin
[5:30:23] <+transporterthesequel> Kingmaker is...uh...not...great
[5:30:24] <joodatious> the tutorials assume you know all of it
[5:30:27] <%Agami23> also weird to me, because im not used to religious stuff as much as high fantasy in D&D
[5:30:34] <%libra_zero> Kingmaker has some excellent mods available
[5:30:38] <cheapdoc> Kingmaker is aight
[5:30:41] <tanarath> sourf code
[5:30:43] <+kawachipto> going back to kingmaker is pretty hard after playing wor
[5:30:45] <+transporterthesequel> And this one does a good job catching you up. At least, for me.
[5:30:46] <+Vigonept> why isn't this game done if its a full realese?
[5:30:48] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Would you say it has rough edges that can be smoothed out with further patches?
[5:30:49] <leinadtonu> just rotating the camera is a huge difference between this and the previous game.
[5:30:57] <%SpoonheadInExile> Seems like it
[5:31:02] <%KineticZen> Poorly optimized
[5:31:05] <+DragonArt07> you can retrain your character no need to start a new game
[5:31:06] <heartlesshealer> came back after deliveries, how was game after jobber dragon?
[5:31:07] <MemAlephh> @Vigonept it is done. i think he just means optimization patches
[5:31:08] <+transporterthesequel> @Vigonept Main campain is done, DLC's are not out yet.
[5:31:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Vigonept Modern video games.
[5:31:09] <%aWanderingKaivo> @GIGA255 like a tile drops from a roof and just brains the villain?
[5:31:12] <RushUnplugged> I'm assuming the game is like 90% cpu
[5:31:13] <$mattynezz> The game was developed basically in order, production value seems to increase linearly
[5:31:19] <@GeneralSCPatton> Your mind goblins might require the Kingmaker mod for controlling time.
[5:31:20] <$lotharrio> Do you mean the cave or the carnival?
[5:31:22] <chowndawg> one of the settings is messed up
[5:31:28] <joodatious> what is a mythic path?
[5:31:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mythic Paths are sort of spoilers.
[5:31:31] <+Vigonept> ah gotcha
[5:31:35] <%SpoonheadInExile> BTW Pat sorry for the Gotcha moment, what I type is usually only 10 percent of what's going through my head
[5:31:35] <Visorak6> There isnt much need, its late game stuff
[5:31:36] <$mattynezz> Yeah, this is cool
[5:31:37] <%bravebravesrobin> Hooray for beer and saki! Cheer500
[5:31:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> They're transformations you unlock in the story.
[5:31:41] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[5:31:44] <%IDTheftVictim> just go to the D20pfsrd, it's basically the wiki
[5:31:44] <+EXPsoon> you can become super cool stuff
[5:31:45] <Vermillion129> kingmaker doesnt have mythic path, it's WOTR thing
[5:31:46] <tanarath> Spoilers
[5:31:49] <%libra_zero> there's quite a few mythic paths, and some of them are behind optional side quests
[5:31:50] <%AncelDeLambert> ah, level 20 shit
[5:31:52] <+kawachipto> what kind of broken god do you want to become
[5:31:53] <+DeadPhoenix3> oh yeah, later in the game it gets a might and magic minigame i hear?
[5:31:57] <MemAlephh> they advertised mythic paths so much i wouldnt even consider it a spoiler
[5:31:58] <%GIGA255> @awanderingkaivo like, gets killed offscreen by some other group with a beef with the guy
[5:31:59] <+Vigonept> spoilers no?
[5:32:00] <$lotharrio> Digivolve
[5:32:04] <%AncelDeLambert> ooh, dragon
[5:32:06] <chowndawg> they are advertised on the website
[5:32:07] <heartlesshealer> yeah, post-leveling stuff
[5:32:09] <tanarath> spoilers
[5:32:13] <Teneb0r> I actually own this entire AP IRL. It's pretty fun.
[5:32:14] <Vermillion129> @AncelDeLambert nah it's story related from start to finish
[5:32:15] <leinadtonu> I'm doing the litch one, shit's cool
[5:32:17] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, this is all divine spark shit
[5:32:18] <+kawachipto> trickster is hilarious
[5:32:20] <heartlesshealer> if it's anything like the TTRPG version of mythics
[5:32:22] <%redthebaron> the swarm that walks is SUCH A GOOD NAME
[5:32:23] <%Agami23> swarm that walks sounds fucking rad
[5:32:24] <drippinduckie> I love the snores in the background LUL
[5:32:29] <%IDTheftVictim> Wrath of the Righteous being a Mythic adventure module was its deal
[5:32:29] <$mattynezz> You become them
[5:32:29] <Visorak6> You become those eventually
[5:32:30] <%newtype89> 10 extra levels more or less
[5:32:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> They're transformations that give new abilities and mechanics.
[5:32:41] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah these are very much things you should probably know, as these are huge game feature's
[5:32:42] <+DeadPhoenix3> its nothing like the ttrpg version of mythic
[5:32:46] <%DianaTheAscian> I'm back did Pat defeat his goblins and like the game?
[5:32:46] <+Vigonept> meh most of those are eh
[5:32:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> ok going lich is pretty rad
[5:32:48] <%libra_zero> Mythic paths give you crazy powerful abilities that no one else in the game has
[5:32:51] <%redthebaron> you get some stuff
[5:32:51] <MemAlephh> lich path is SUPER buggy right now
[5:32:52] <$lotharrio> It's how you Digivolve into Champion
[5:32:53] <Vermillion129> @PatStaresAt Essentially story route for WOTR that change how you play by a ton
[5:32:53] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> How long until I get to be Ainz from Overlord?
[5:32:55] <heartlesshealer> ah, then no idea
[5:32:56] <+transporterthesequel> YES
[5:32:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> It does.
[5:32:57] <%GIGA255> Gotta scratch that Lich, Pat.
[5:32:58] <%Reaviar> kind of
[5:32:59] <ScrubTheNerd> Yes it does
[5:32:59] <cheapdoc> In ways
[5:33:01] <+kawachipto> yeah
[5:33:01] <%Piemono> Yeah kinda
[5:33:01] <Visorak6> Yes
[5:33:03] <$mattynezz> Big Time
[5:33:03] <%Reaviar> it alters choices
[5:33:04] <%AyotoCorp> Yes
[5:33:04] <leinadtonu> yep
[5:33:05] <tanarath> Mythic shit is fun
[5:33:06] <%Monkeyweed21> yea this seems important
[5:33:08] <MemAlephh> yes
[5:33:08] <+EXPsoon> YES
[5:33:09] <+DragonArt07> you can be a lich
[5:33:09] <%Lefanque> yeah changes story quite a bit
[5:33:12] <%redthebaron> it is really funny
[5:33:13] <%libra_zero> big huge changes
[5:33:16] <tanarath> Y E S
[5:33:20] <alternatecoyote> Can’t wait for the Pat Toilet Lich playthrough
[5:33:22] <heartlesshealer> I would think being a fucking LICH would change the story
[5:33:24] <+EXPsoon> There are things that make you do insane stuff, the swarm one is the most odd one but cool
[5:33:27] <leinadtonu> build your own ziggurat
[5:33:28] <Vermillion129> we yall at sony shit
[5:33:29] <%Monkeyweed21> you get new choices and lose certain other options
[5:33:29] <Teneb0r> certain options are more "morally dubious" than others.
[5:33:31] <+boriss96> yea swarm is crazy
[5:33:33] <@GeneralSCPatton> Apparently Azata lets you just super bypass resistances
[5:33:35] <Profmcstevie> Sony straight into NMH3 huh
[5:33:36] <@Ranryu692> probably won't be able to make that, so have fun y'all
[5:33:36] <$lotharrio> Different scenarios or just major alterations to them?
[5:33:37] <%Puhff> 330 EST?
[5:33:40] <+transporterthesequel> I have a feeling this will be a Pat game.
[5:33:47] <+DragonArt07> new gameplay features
[5:33:50] <+transporterthesequel> As this would be a TITANIC playthrough
[5:33:51] <%NopeBadguy> boy i hope they show capcom stuff
[5:33:53] <+DragonArt07> Aeon is Time cop
[5:34:03] <Vermillion129> swarm sound hilarious to play
[5:34:05] <%Puhff> Probably EST
[5:34:08] <leinadtonu> Aeon can change the timeline...
[5:34:10] <+Vigonept> they won't
[5:34:16] <$mattynezz> Being generally overwhelmed by a game
[5:34:29] <%faldin> dont invest in scams
[5:34:30] <joodatious> if you go lich do you actually look like a lich or is it just abilities?
[5:34:36] <%Puhff> invest in my bank account
[5:34:43] <Teneb0r> Do what I do and be an Always CE/LE/NE/ME Male Elf Witch 19/Arcmage 10
[5:34:48] <%moonmintparadise> Invest into Cheese and Wine
[5:34:48] <Vermillion129> @joodatious your character change looks too
[5:34:49] <@ssjklyco> But it's a video game
[5:34:50] <%The_Protagonist> invest in manga because anime was a mistake
[5:34:51] <%SpoonheadInExile> LUL
[5:34:52] <+transporterthesequel> @joodatious You get the whole package, look, new portrait and all.
[5:34:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> @joodatious You actually become a lich.
[5:34:57] <$mattynezz> You look like a Lich late in the game
[5:35:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> The mythic paths also transform you.
[5:35:06] <%GIGA255> NFTs are the most asinine nonsensical thing i've ever heard of
[5:35:08] <joodatious> ohh thats cool
[5:35:11] <%moonmintparadise> I really can not blame you today a lot because D&D has allways been kinda fucked for video games
[5:35:12] <%Puhff> ok?
[5:35:16] <%bravebravesrobin> depends what crypto
[5:35:17] <%TheFabledAble> @patstaresat that was in reference to your question about ACTUAL tabletop dnd
[5:35:24] <heartlesshealer> it's just money laundering
[5:35:26] <chowndawg> live in a cave and survive forever
[5:35:26] <+Vigonept> But you will die eventually
[5:35:31] <%SpoonheadInExile> psaCrazyhead If you see this, my bad, okay?
[5:35:32] <joodatious> lmao
[5:35:36] <%SuckerPunchSyd> It can eventually be like that but in video games yeah you have like not much of a pressure from time
[5:35:44] <$lotharrio> Oh yeah, in the 2nd edition starter scenario, it mentioned that if you take a week to complete the dungeon, then villain just wins and turns into a dragon that you can't stop.
[5:35:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> DnD video games are hard because a computer can't improvise
[5:35:53] <%SirGO0SE> whoever that was, dont start with nfts, if you fall into them great but they are not friendly to new investors. in the crypto space right now make a portfolio of 33% btc 33% eth 33% stables and go from there. gl
[5:35:53] <%bravebravesrobin> your not my real dad!
[5:35:53] <%Puhff> Robin has Died
