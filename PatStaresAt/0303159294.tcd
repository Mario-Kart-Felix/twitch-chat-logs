[0:45:30] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> OH

[0:45:34] <Ralyks_Larettil> @Toynota10 this game can run on a potato, its very well optimized
[0:45:36] <acridPaladin> You can buy a battery that makes the scanner infnite
[0:45:37] <KatabolicRage> yeah there's like 4 upgrades for the simaris scanner
[0:45:37] <TheMrTwisted> sol-battery
[0:45:37] <%Divryne> It's solar powered.
[0:45:38] <CertainlySyrix> It's an upgrade widget you can get for the synthesis scanners.
[0:45:38] <+Punisher7771> its 50 k rep
[0:45:40] <$Mendin> They're smoking fragments that kinda blend into the fog

[0:45:56] <+Toynota10> @ralyks_larettil Cool
[0:45:57] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat You can cash simarus rep for faster scans, infinite scan ammo, double scans and enemy-weakness revealing scans.
[0:45:58] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat You scanner highlights it in the bacground THEY ARE RIGHT THERE HIGHLIGHTED YO CAN SEE THEM
[0:46:00] <+GuelermeDias> lol
[0:46:00] <%Divryne> There's a cloth on the stone wall.

[0:47:34] <+Grayhammatter> he got bodied super hard
[0:47:34] <%Nilysila> got fucking rekted
[0:47:35] <+AntithesisEK> baleted
[0:47:35] <%pennykettle_> Parts of this quest make 0 sense and make some big jumps to get stuff done, its no second dream
[0:47:41] <+Thorn14> inb4 pat runs out of parts LUL
[0:47:41] <DarkKnightGrave> ded
[0:47:43] <$Wukku> Super Super spoilers - @stigna1 When you start the game "you were not with him"
[0:47:46] <OrochiSheewa> ordid best space parent
[0:47:46] <Ropcord> @stigna1 when you were stuck in a cryopod before the game started
[0:47:47] <AncelDeLambert> I don't for the life of me understand how Umbra does what Umbra does after he's built
[0:47:48] <Inebriateddonut> Ballas used the zapping system
[0:47:48] <$Wukku> Close enough lol
[0:47:52] <Meneliki> How responsive is your controller? I find there's a tiny deadzone on mine. brand new. drives me nuts
[0:47:55] <+GuelermeDias> pat and his "i didn't spend too much money on it" setup
[0:47:57] <$Mendin> <Laughs Vay Hekishly>
[0:47:57] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> Inaros is strong
[0:47:58] <AncelDeLambert> it's a NEW UMBRA
[0:48:04] <+Gorgen> that is a great augment
[0:48:04] <+ZebraFace> Can i get a time estimate till cyberpunk?
[0:48:05] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh fucking what
[0:48:06] <acridPaladin> That augment is really trash. Stop using it
[0:48:08] <+Rivet95> If you like the Tigris Prime, you really should try the Strun. It's all the rage.
[0:48:12] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> that's an augment?
[0:48:13] <%stigna1> Huh, I didn't think Ordis knew us before we met him then.
[0:48:16] <Zombrocom> Inaros is best boy. My inaros build gives him 8k hp
[0:48:17] <archxeno> so this game is easy?
[0:48:18] <Fabric_tester> No, They are not that big of a deal
[0:48:22] <zal_silverfang> Just 900?
[0:48:22] <CertainlySyrix> @acridPaladin It actually isn't. It has stats on it that aren't immediatelly apparent
[0:48:26] <talisign> The ghoulies must be so embarassed right now
[0:48:28] <AncelDeLambert> I hate the chill clouds the ghouls leave
[0:48:31] <KatabolicRage> it's more like if you know what your doing you can make the game easy
[0:48:34] <CertainlySyrix> @acridPaladin Like full knockdown immunity.
[0:48:34] <%stigna1> @archxeno Not really, but pat is very much overleveled for this stuff.
[0:48:35] <%sassyquatch963> confidence go up
[0:48:35] <Skybrid> @acridPaladin It's totally viable. Until you get *spoiler* mods.
[0:48:36] <%Mornaka> apatDab
[0:48:40] <+GuelermeDias> i just rock a hek/atomos
[0:48:40] <%boarqueen> pat big strong
[0:48:41] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> @acridPaladin that is not a trash augment, I'd pay a lot more than that for no status effects
[0:48:43] <%finaltrinity5> 900p? hot damn
[0:48:43] <sunny935> ah nice caught it on the first mission
[0:48:43] <+SimplyPandaz> So this is a game where you get big and strong so you dont have to fight and can just run
[0:48:44] <Qestovai> What a sad little amp.
[0:48:45] <ChronoJXF> KKona MingLee
[0:48:47] <Skybrid> Alexa play Despacito
[0:48:48] <%pennykettle_> horrific
[0:48:48] <panchetekills> remember when pat just got into warframe? look at him now, all fast and shiny

[0:49:16] <+GuelermeDias> unless you have to shoot shit then you're fucked
[0:49:16] <acridPaladin> Or Rhino that just dashes so hard they explode?
[0:49:17] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat or you're Limbo and you go into the shadow realm
[0:49:17] <CertainlySyrix> Volt can go so fast the animations of the game can barely keep up with him.
[0:49:18] <RevenTheLight> LET'S GOOOO
[0:49:19] <randomp141> Fly into a black hole, do something interesting

[0:50:01] <cizal11> NECK THING?
[0:50:01] <CertainlySyrix> That's a genius idea.
[0:50:02] <Skybrid> Loops bring you strength, Pat
[0:50:05] <cgmerryo> Ordis said he needs more data to make it
[0:50:06] <+TsunamiPoro> that sounds like that could only go wrong
[0:50:12] <+ginnyfield> let the cat speak
[0:50:12] <AncelDeLambert> they literally GIVE Umbra to you, what is he out of?

[0:54:13] <Innocuous_Goat> Pat, look at them
[0:54:16] <%pennykettle_> the GORE frame
[0:54:16] <DarkKnightGrave> stroke pat
[0:54:18] <Worldbrand> Zephyr does have the cockpit
[0:54:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat also gore themed
[0:54:18] <+furiousfurioso> I wrote down those symbols on a note pad like a chump
[0:54:20] <+gelert16> she's coming with fortuna
[0:54:22] <KatabolicRage> eh, maybe mirage could work for that?
[0:54:22] <+jestrfestr> the best designer is making garuda too
[0:54:23] <Meneliki> valkyr 2.0
[0:54:23] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> you mean the RIP AND TEAR Warframe?
[0:54:28] <tremerss> garuda is making me want to get in again
[0:54:30] <Skybrid> Darude?
[0:54:35] <+mikesniderman> use volt for Jehuty
[0:54:37] <+Gorgen> zephyr has a flappy bird easter egg
[0:54:37] <iusetheinternet> i already made a jehuty in the ZOE1 colors, it scratches that ZOE void until MARS comes out
[0:54:41] <OrochiSheewa> i lol'ed so hard when i got india jones'ed by that thing
[0:54:42] <Ropcord> put zephyr at 300% ability duration and you'll never need an archwing launcher again
[0:54:46] <$Mendin> Maroo just got moist and doesn't know why
[0:54:46] <dekkitout> does garuda look like a gerudo?
[0:54:47] <+ajcritfumble> ive played all the quests and played about 500 hours and ive NEVER seen that goofy indiana jones rolling ball bullshit
[0:54:47] <zal_silverfang> Ayatan
[0:54:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Skybrid Garuda after the (Persona) Indian myth
[0:55:01] <cizal11> helios is getting rocked
[0:55:02] <RevenTheLight> ayayayayayaaaan sculpture
[0:55:08] <+GuelermeDias> persona is indian confirmed
[0:55:10] <iusetheinternet> Volt and Zephyr are good bases or jehuty cosplays
[0:55:10] <zdaisharin> it didnt even had time to adapt WTF
[0:55:10] <%Mornaka> @dekkitout the garuda is a mythical bird thing
[0:55:11] <%pennykettle_> I never levled my operator before this at all
[0:55:13] <%Lordgale119> TBH Garuda and Zephyr should have swapped names.
[0:55:14] <%Falilth> did the cyberpunk already happen?
[0:55:18] <OrochiSheewa> ... I wasn't
[0:55:19] <%Divryne> Unless you don't level up your operator.
[0:55:19] <+tehspiritbear> i was pretty underpowered, took me so long to kill the mimics
[0:55:19] <%TheMattman1313> I wasn't, fuck those mimics and their resistances!
[0:55:20] <+shaderichter_belmont> no it kind of is just you
[0:55:20] <+NWR_James> fat?
[0:55:20] <aeonicvector> Oofh
[0:55:21] <Skybrid> @legendfather_of_giants I know, I'm memeing. I like original concept art better btw, with beak and all.
[0:55:21] <%stigna1> @Falilth Nay
[0:55:21] <cerberuscarmine> cyber punk is after this
[0:55:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Falilth no
[0:55:22] <%Lordgale119> Garuda is a protective deity of wind
[0:55:22] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> That's a good buff
[0:55:23] <talisign> what?
[0:55:24] <CertainlySyrix> When I first got to Lua I thought it was pretty tough.
[0:55:24] <$Mendin> Ehhh that Tigris Prime is a bit extra-fucked-powerful
[0:55:24] <+JoeStillLife> LUL
[0:55:25] <+Grayhammatter> i wasn't

[0:55:26] <%Keansor> I wasn't. It was uh. Frustrating.
[0:55:26] <KatabolicRage> I dunno man, there was this one guy the other day who had 200 hours and was still using a mk1 braton and still had the grineer bolt attached
[0:55:26] <%Lordgale119> That's Zephyr
[0:55:27] <RevenTheLight> OwO
[0:55:28] <$ThePaleSage> I wasnt
[0:55:28] <+GuelermeDias> you can never get too big
[0:55:29] <%OceanGovernor> Yeah its a real thing
[0:55:29] <Skybrid> Hahahaha
[0:55:30] <+future_famous_person> LUL
[0:55:30] <+tadok0ro> i wasn't
[0:55:30] <HelterSkeltr> tons of people come into this with no proper amp and bad weapons
[0:55:31] <DigbyMayor> I wasn't. I was like halfway there
[0:55:32] <OrochiSheewa> I even completed with the mote amp
[0:55:37] <+velemi> I've seen that porn
[0:55:38] <%Dimfish> you can never be too huge
[0:55:38] <+PeaceCentennial> Does Pat not have a shield?
[0:55:41] <%Everpresent_Overseer> that is why I bring a weaker frame to feel the thrill of the mission
[0:55:42] <+PeaceCentennial> Is that was Inaros does?
[0:55:42] <+shaderichter_belmont> you just bought so much power that your point of view is entirely abnormal
[0:55:42] <@WoolyFish> Get swoll like Gang Orca.
[0:55:43] <%b0neh34d> Not buff.... BUT HUUUUUUGE!
[0:55:44] <%Kratok> @Falilth if you just want that Pat'll tweet about it when Cyberpunk starts
[0:55:44] <LixFury> Synthanol injection huge LUL
[0:55:45] <DavidSanChan> that's what lesser bros are for
[0:55:47] <DigbyMayor> Because I didn't spend a shit zillion dollars PAT
[0:55:49] <+Gorgen> they're weak to void damage crikIQ
[0:55:49] <Ralyks_Larettil> @PeaceCentennial inaros has no shield
[0:55:50] <Ser_Randal> Big Dick Energy
[0:55:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Tigris was already disgusting on its own
[0:55:53] <KatabolicRage> shields are for babies who don't have 5000+ health
[0:55:54] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @PeaceCentennial Some frames just don't have shields
[0:55:54] <talisign> Who needs shield when you are too buff to reach your dick?
[0:55:55] <+PeaceCentennial> Oh interesting
[0:55:57] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Same with Nidus
[0:55:58] <%GarbageNirvana> And then they went and made a prime version
[0:56:00] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat climb the wall pat
[0:56:01] <Skybrid> You try the easy way first
[0:56:04] <SummonerMagno> Not me didnt even have amp
[0:56:05] <CertainlySyrix> @PeaceCentennial inaros has some other abilities too, though those aren't required for him atm
[0:56:08] <+GuelermeDias> that's not the pat way
[0:56:14] <KatabolicRage> honestly shields are overall a bit useless in warframe, there's too many attacks that just straight up bypass them like toxin and slash status procs
[0:56:19] <+GuelermeDias> pat tries the dumb way first
[0:56:24] <+GuelermeDias> then he tries the easy way
[0:56:24] <iusetheinternet> @PeaceCentennial inarous and nidus dont have shields theyre just huge in the armor and hp department
[0:56:26] <Semiconductive> drop your shield tho
[0:56:37] <ShoddySpice> Mimics are just the second weakest of the sentients defense wise.
[0:56:38] <cerberuscarmine> XD
[0:56:44] <DarkKnightGrave> Nailed it.
[0:56:45] <+Gorgen> blinding rage is great on Inaros. Unlimited energy
[0:56:48] <%stigna1> Brute intellect.
[0:56:48] <sunny935> too bad pat is going to miss out on the somachord segments
[0:56:49] <+Laecerelius> Tons of hp and armor plus abilities that heal them easily
[0:56:51] <%boarqueen> big puzzle
[0:56:58] <+unfoldingchoas> thank god for helios lol
[0:56:58] <cizal11> here we go
[0:57:03] <feuddude> @KatabolicRage also armour only affects health
[0:57:03] <iusetheinternet> i hate this puzzle so much
[0:57:05] <Ralyks_Larettil> @Gorgen you mean Rage
[0:57:08] <PsychedelicSnake> GEARS BURNING

[0:57:16] <TheInkshow> wtf?
[0:57:17] <KTDelgado> the puzzle auto solves itsqlf pat
[0:57:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PeaceCentennial Inaros becomes op with a dagger and Covert Lethality, it lets him oneshot anything blinded by his 1
[0:57:20] <dekkitout> aneurysm intensifies
[0:57:20] <RevenTheLight> I always figure out how it works when I'm working it, but then forg\et again lol
[0:57:21] <+Gorgen> @Ralyks_Larettil Yes that
[0:57:22] <+Silentman0> oh no now pat has to actually puzzle
[0:57:23] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> get comfy people, we might be here for a while

[1:10:28] <TheInkshow> TO JUPITER
[1:10:28] <%stigna1> @SleepyMaribo He's...not talking to a warframe.
[1:10:29] <+TehBeerBaron> I had a weird glitch at this point where I was still playing as excalibur umbra
[1:10:29] <gryffinp> I like a frame with some fight in her
[1:10:29] <Ropcord> he has a 111
[1:10:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> @YabbaTroll yes
[1:10:30] <Worldbrand> yeah he's got an amp, thankfully
[1:10:30] <CertainlySyrix> I love a girl who can kick my ass.
[1:10:31] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> @YabbaTroll he did
[1:10:32] <AncelDeLambert> Pat likes edgyboi
[1:10:32] <%Arxel1> SleepyMaribo The Oroking did. And the Sentient said 'Fuck it, you aint gonna ruin more planets'
[1:10:32] <DarkKnightGrave> Get ready to die. A lot.
[1:10:33] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> no worries
[1:10:34] <Ropcord> he'll be fine LUL
[1:10:34] <+YabbaTroll> sweet
[1:10:35] <GodlyLuigi> @SleepyMaribo orokin killed earth and the sentients decided nah fuck finding another planet for these guys
[1:10:35] <turf_wind_and_fire> I'm not familiar with warframe so I'm just enjoying the ride at this point LUL
[1:10:37] <+d00msdaydan> what if as soon as dio stabbed himself with the arrow his stand just chokeslammed him
[1:10:37] <Tucker0603> GET READY FOR A SHITTY FIGHT!
[1:10:37] <urs0jb> ballas was talking about the sentient people
[1:10:39] <%chubbypencil> Pat's sub tendencies are leaking again
[1:10:39] <Skybrid> Umbra is one angry boi
[1:10:44] <+Gorgen> better than a Mote
[1:10:44] <feuddude> @panchetekills HOLY FUCKING SIT YOU'RE 💯% RIGHT NotLikeThis
[1:10:44] <gryffinp> Good enough, I did it with 111
[1:10:45] <Nekros4442> it'll be good enough
[1:10:47] <RevenTheLight> better then amp
[1:10:48] <AncelDeLambert> 2 edg 4 me
[1:10:49] <%President_Miyazaki> @SleepyMaribo The Orokin destroyed earth, Sentients came to stop them from destroying more worlds after they were sent out to terraform them, Warframes were made to kill sentients.
[1:10:49] <alpharius88> get in the frame shinji i mean pat
[1:10:50] <KnivesEve> i painted my umbra as unit 01 for reasons
[1:10:51] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @SleepyMaribo the orikin did and sent the sentients to colonize far reaches of space, sentients realized history would repeat, and fought the orikin instead
[1:10:51] <Vulkoor> WHEN WOOLIE WILL PLAY WARFRAME AGAIN?
[1:10:51] <+velemi> Pat gets horny for getting beat up
[1:10:53] <SleepyMaribo> holy shit this game man

[1:11:32] <+VidulaSaix> The final CURRENT quest to be clear
[1:11:33] <+AXL808> It's what they deserve for being SO late to the party
[1:11:34] <HelterSkeltr> not final, just most recent
[1:11:34] <Qestovai> So the Sentients were actually Enviromentalists, basically following the way of Captain Planet...by killing their creators.
[1:11:34] <+velemi> awww

[1:11:46] <ChronoJXF> money KKona
[1:11:46] <%Deekman> I didn't even know they were humans in suits
[1:11:47] <LixFury> WARFRAME IS JUST EVA LUL
[1:11:49] <%Deekman> maybe?
[1:11:49] <dekkitout> warframe without context is like jojo without context, you have no idea why that vampire has a road roller, but sure, whynot...
[1:11:51] <Tomschiii> even tho i played both story Missions. i still dont get a thing
[1:11:59] <Huntercd> So dude is trying to find space mom?
[1:11:59] <talisign> Its cool.I know so little about the lore I don't get who space dad is or what that means.
[1:11:59] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> that hammer finisher is rad
[1:12:01] <DigbyMayor> Why was that not a mimic damnit
[1:12:03] <feuddude> WARFRAMES ARE PEOPLE, I WILL DATE VALKYR AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
[1:12:05] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> How far are we in the quest currently?
[1:12:06] <cizal11> man i hope an event soon just dumps endo all over, it's so tough to get enough for everything
[1:12:08] <SpaceCatStation> it's the angry boy
[1:12:11] <iusetheinternet> hurt me more snake
[1:12:12] <+Aekrid> Umbra casually screaming in the distance
[1:12:13] <GandhiTheTerrible> *muffled screaming in the distance*
[1:12:14] <+Laecerelius> Warframe is not just Eva. It's Eva 40k, get it right.
[1:12:15] <cerberuscarmine> VALKYR IS MIIIINE
[1:12:16] <%pennykettle_> plot bodies

[1:12:24] <+AcidicHorizon> just started the "talk" with ballas
[1:12:26] <TheInkshow> I have nothing to do with it
[1:12:26] <Skybrid> Cutting things helps him relax
[1:12:28] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> at least DE knows what the aftermath of a warframe looks like
[1:12:29] <+greatersea> I can't wait for @AngriestPat to get the special mods and see how much health inaros can get
[1:12:30] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Deekman big spoilers
[1:12:30] <Ropcord> knowing that it's Steve screaming in the background makes the quest ten times better
[1:12:33] <$Mendin> Umbra's going Jack the Ripper
[1:12:34] <%finaltrinity5> unfortunately I won't be able to sink time into this for quite some time
[1:12:36] <%President_Miyazaki> Umbra is going to rip and tear, until it is done.

[1:17:55] <+preppyposs> HOW
[1:17:56] <+beautyfulman> @AngriestPat Walls are counted as your own stones in the sense of capturing, so if you are surrounded at all sides except for one wall, it counts as a capture
[1:17:58] <InspectahDecck> This lore is retarded

[1:19:19] <+Shaggnar> LUL
[1:19:19] <calder87> this quest is broken on its own. I got Umbra in my inventory before finishing the questline

[1:19:21] <RevenTheLight> The bags in the back!
[1:19:22] <%AcidicHorizon> He gonna kill a family member for every stone lost in the games you play
[1:19:22] <Firefly1009> @Youwereeatenbyalid It progresses even if you lose. Update maybe.
[1:19:24] <%cirdrag> he is speaking toyour mind
[1:19:25] <%Keansor> Every stone he captures is another member of that guy's family that he'll kill
[1:19:27] <b1gboss007> LUL
[1:19:29] <%Keansor> Good job Pat
[1:19:29] <B1n0va> He just wanted to clarify
[1:19:31] <+AXL808> "You thought you could beat me" "I have no idea what is happening..."
[1:19:33] <bwong1231> those are Umbra's flashbacks
[1:19:37] <%finaltrinity5> Inverted Penis
[1:19:39] <reonome> "i was forced to play go, it was horrible!"
[1:19:39] <%Dingus_Tickler> To be fair, Warframe is a game for people with high IQ atpCap
[1:19:40] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> @Firefly1009 there's supposed to be around in between that conversation and the end
[1:19:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat confuse
[1:19:44] <PsychedelicSnake> @AngriestPat But yeah basically each stone you lose Ballas executes a membr of your family. He's kind of a dick
[1:19:45] <+Thorn14> That was umbra's memories Pat
[1:19:47] <+Ssaik> lol
[1:19:49] <$TheNeedlesD> Just play Pat

[1:19:59] <+darkmithrionx> LUL
[1:20:00] <+Yeajow> Umbra was bad at go
[1:20:00] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Well the point was that hes smarter then you so.
[1:20:00] <talisign> New clips have been made
[1:20:00] <DigbyMayor> Dipshit
[1:20:01] <Skybrid> You need at least 200 IQ to understand it, to be honest
[1:20:05] <+preppyposs> @AngriestPat umbra was spying on ballas who was working as a double agent for the sentients
[1:20:06] <+Reevesypoo> Make big stone circle around bad guy stones
[1:20:06] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> THERE WILL BE ANOTHER
[1:20:07] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Place stones to surround groups of enemy stones, to take them. Avoid the same happening to you.
[1:20:07] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat It's othello, but the captured pieces disappear.
[1:20:08] <TheInkshow> DOESNT MATTER IF U PLAY GOOD
[1:20:09] <zal_silverfang> Pat is talking about Komi guys
[1:20:09] <Firefly1009> @AngriestPat you make a + shape with the enemy stone in the middle.
[1:20:10] <SatansDick1> cool and smart
[1:20:10] <acridPaladin> Grouped stones protect each other. So 2 stones next to each other cant be captured 1 at a time
[1:20:10] <MrSuplexArt> ez pz
[1:20:10] <KatabolicRage> Admit it, you enjoy being confused
[1:20:11] <+Eclipse_knight_> @angriestpat have you never played othello?
[1:20:13] <+PeaceCentennial> it's basically the plot to animorphs ok just think of it like that
[1:20:13] <KnivesEve> just play the game will take pity on your soul
[1:20:15] <+coolthulhuu> you and paige were made for each other, you both get stuck at the stupidest places
[1:20:15] <TheInkshow> STORY IS THE SAME
[1:20:17] <%Arxel1> Ballas sold out to the sentient Pat, that's it
[1:20:24] <%AcidicHorizon> You need an IQ of at least 250 to play warframe
[1:20:24] <SoushinSen> Wow, Warframe has fast movements.
[1:20:26] <PsychedelicSnake> PLAYED OTHELLO
[1:20:27] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat No no it was just in character. Pats Rping.
[1:20:27] <+velemi> Go is like one of the simplest games to understand
[1:20:29] <%Codename_Torch> @AngriestPat So far... Ballas was defecting from the orokin but dax listened in on ballas messages and found out about Ballas and his trickery. ill post more when you get there
[1:20:29] <Worldbrand> othello is not go lmao
[1:20:30] <+VidulaSaix> Chat dont fucking spoil before the quest reveals it
[1:20:30] <Twoiis> Othello doesn't really apply.
[1:20:31] <%Divryne> NotLikeThis
[1:20:32] <xfiring> Good news, backgammon is nothing like that
[1:20:35] <TheInkshow> THose are the kind of games u play in porn
[1:20:36] <42nfl19> But do you have reading comprehension?
[1:20:39] <randomp141> And he sucks at all of them.
[1:20:40] <DigbyMayor> The oldest game in the world
[1:20:41] <%Jpdodds> I wonder is pat is good at chess
[1:20:41] <tungstenviper> IT ISN'T LIKE CHECKERS
[1:20:42] <TheMrTwisted> its checkmate the game
[1:20:42] <kiri_sute_gomen> cipher LUL
[1:20:42] <californaya> Othello is basically the same as what I saw there
[1:20:42] <+graffitisamurai> you position pieces to surround your opponents
[1:20:45] <Nekros4442> @42nfl19 dude....
[1:20:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it's just complicated checkers
[1:20:48] <+furiousfurioso> It doesn't matter if he's never played those, the rules were right there
[1:20:48] <$TheNeedlesD> You're a master at Connect Four, you can't forget that, Pat
[1:20:48] <%finaltrinity5> Pat was actually playing 7th dimension mousetrap
[1:20:49] <acridPaladin> Cyphers taterLUL
[1:20:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat You caught traitor Ballas, but he caught you too
[1:20:51] <loganzeri> what is inaros'cape?
[1:20:52] <calder87> how many of YOU know how to play go
[1:20:52] <reonome> pat can't into puzzle board games
[1:20:53] <talisign> Just play it like its Monopoly. The principles are the same
[1:20:54] <ChronoJXF> the game doesnt spoonfeed the details chat, get rekt chat KKona MingLee
[1:20:54] <viewtifulr> plays video games for a living never played the one that has go in it
[1:20:55] <%finaltrinity5> Y'all are just too stupid
[1:20:57] <%Codename_Torch> @AngriestPat So far... Ballas was defecting from the orokin but dax listened in on ballas messages and found out about Ballas and his trikery. ill post more when you get there.
[1:20:57] <%Everpresent_Overseer> F for Helios
[1:20:59] <+GuelermeDias> pat isn't good at connect 4
[1:21:00] <sakugasmear> played connect 4
[1:21:01] <+GuelermeDias> it's fine
[1:21:01] <+shaderichter_belmont> I mean we've all seen pat play XCOM so are we at all surprised that he was terrible at strategic placement
[1:21:03] <+VidulaSaix> You super didnt
[1:21:05] <reonome> i don't think you understand what surrond means
[1:21:05] <Junkfist> No you didn't.
[1:21:05] <%korth367> but u didnt tho
[1:21:05] <Twoiis> You did not surround.
[1:21:06] <+GuelermeDias> woolie beat him again
[1:21:07] <HelterSkeltr> you have to surround them completely
[1:21:08] <%Keansor> I'll admit I got confused by it a number of times as well
[1:21:08] <randomp141> You did NOT there was a gap
[1:21:08] <+Grayhammatter> don't get boxed in a corner
[1:21:08] <KatabolicRage> you surround them on the side of EVERY cardinal direction
[1:21:09] <EASrake> It has to be YOUR pieces
[1:21:09] <%skizzuto> no you went in the corner and got cornered
[1:21:09] <%Raspada_Ryner> You did not
[1:21:10] <+Thorn14> its not important Pat
[1:21:10] <reonome> NO YOU DIDN'T
[1:21:10] <+beautyfulman> No, you didn't
[1:21:10] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> No you didn't
[1:21:10] <panchetekills> I THINK AFTER THIS YOU CAN NEVER MAKE FUN OF PEACH AGAIN
[1:21:11] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> You didn't surround him
[1:21:11] <%SergeEXE> You super did not
[1:21:12] <+Shaggnar> Diagonals don't count
[1:21:12] <Seditary> you never did
[1:21:12] <+velemi> he surrounded YOU
[1:21:12] <PsychedelicSnake> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[1:21:14] <aeonicvector> surround, groups count, and walls count
[1:21:14] <acridPaladin> He cant lose his own on his turn
[1:21:14] <+GuelermeDias> and took all the lives of his descendants
[1:21:14] <forlorncarton> it only counts when you place a piece
[1:21:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you put it down where YOU wer surrounded
[1:21:14] <+Thorn14> its literally not important
[1:21:14] <+shawntk_> you can't surround on their turn
[1:21:15] <custoadian> can't surround yourself
[1:21:16] <+Reevesypoo> It has to be surrounded by your pieces except for corners
[1:21:16] <%pennykettle_> you surround existing ones not once he place
[1:21:16] <scrumdrew> no you didnt
[1:21:16] <+Ssaik> just ignore it
[1:21:16] <+Silentman0> you have to surround it on YOUR turn, dingus
[1:21:16] <bloodypurpledog> Pat this game is basically just mouse trap
[1:21:16] <+NWR_James> Because you were ALSO surrounded
[1:21:16] <turf_wind_and_fire> No you put it in the middle of his
[1:21:17] <+paladinstarbuster> nope
[1:21:17] <tungstenviper> NOPE
[1:21:17] <%GarbageNirvana> What hammer skin is that
[1:21:18] <%OceanGovernor> apatCrazyhead
[1:21:18] <+furiousfurioso> you did not surround his piece
[1:21:18] <%Divryne> He put it somewhere else. LUL
[1:21:18] <reonome> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SURROUND MEANS
[1:21:19] <%Superstarsage> Aggressor wins, defensive loses
[1:21:20] <tacostarvedbeast> No u didn’t
[1:21:21] <+Gorgen> suplex elmo
[1:21:21] <Tucker0603> NO YOU DIDN'T
[1:21:21] <KatabolicRage> whatever it's fine
[1:21:22] <%PatNTheHat> @That works if he would surround a piece by placing it
[1:21:23] <%Mornaka> @AngriestPat newest placement takes priority
[1:21:23] <randomp141> Then he put a piece down where there was no gap
[1:21:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Also where the hell do you get hammer stances
[1:21:25] <Theta_Bug> LORE
[1:21:27] <%MagickBurritoh> YOU FOOLISH FOLL
[1:21:27] <xfiring> He can't surround himself?
[1:21:28] <MrSuplexArt> you should just rewatch what you recorded
[1:21:28] <loganzeri> wat is your cape pat please tell me
[1:21:29] <%mordred_t> @AngriestPat Ballas is defecting to the Sentient. He used that Vitruvian you found to sneak all knowledge of the warframe project ti the Sentient, including how you can actually kill them. Umbra was a Dax soldier who discovered this, and now those flashbacks are what Ballas does to make him into Umbra.
[1:21:29] <giga_bit> It wasn't surrounded though. The whites don't count.
[1:21:30] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @AngriestPat the walls of the board count as pieces for either of you, you put your pieces against the board and then he captured yours
[1:21:30] <dekkitout> situation awareness go down
[1:21:30] <$ThePaleSage> Only the final placement counts
[1:21:30] <Worldbrand> dont worry about it
[1:21:32] <%Dingus_Tickler> Pat surrounded him like how he beat Woolie in Connect 4
[1:21:32] <MrSuplexArt> you'd understand it then
[1:21:33] <%TheMorilo> I'm screaming at him and I'm watching the archive
[1:21:33] <+PinkSuprende> If its connected to another peice of the same color you didnt surround it on all sides
[1:21:34] <+AXL808> You need to surround from 4 sides unless there is a wall or corner.
[1:21:35] <SoushinSen> Which platform is this? PC?
[1:21:36] <viewtifulr> Go back to Triple Triads you loser
[1:21:41] <BadgerDK> it's checkers for babies
[1:21:46] <%ThatRandomGuy661> corners don't count
[1:21:47] <talisign> ALL PLATFORMS!!
[1:21:49] <+beautyfulman> @AngriestPat I think you're literally confusing which color was him and which was you, because you just let him surround you multiple times
[1:21:49] <Rellim80> It hoes to the agressor
[1:21:54] <%Codename_Torch> @mordred_t SPOILER
[1:21:55] <TheMirai> it's a fighting game trap, you have to train him into believing you're going to play one direction, then surprise him with a trap you laid that surrounds a different piece he's not paying attention to. Just guessing randomly will screw you over.
[1:21:55] <%Keansor> @mordred_t Jeeze man give him a chance to figure out at least
[1:22:08] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Ballas is better than you at some obscure board game. Its ok; the game expects you to lose anyway.
[1:22:10] <%pennykettle_> Orokin are fuckin evil
[1:22:10] <%Daigrey> infested
[1:22:17] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> @mordred_t could you not?
[1:22:20] <%sassyquatch963> @AngriestPat if you surround 1 white piece with 4 black pieces, that 1 white piece is removed. YOU CANNOT SURROUND YOUR OWN PIECES. Pieces of the same colour are now a group. so 2 white pieces, take 6 black pieces to completely surround them
[1:22:22] <Lysdexic9541> The Infested
[1:22:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you're expected to lose
[1:22:28] <%MagickBurritoh> has he done nidus quest yet?
[1:22:31] <+Thorn14> no
[1:22:32] <Karhax> no

[1:22:54] <iusetheinternet> ballas is evil
[1:22:56] <+VidulaSaix> Yes @panchetekills
[1:22:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @VidulaSaix he hasn't started it yet
[1:22:57] <+Thorn14> He's talkign to Hunhow in this yes
[1:23:05] <TheInkshow> Nidus boy
[1:23:11] <+VidulaSaix> These are the transmissions that Umbra intercepted
[1:23:11] <DigbyMayor> They're just slabs of ground beef in exosuits
[1:23:13] <Meneliki> @panchetekills yes
[1:23:16] <+d00msdaydan> BIODRONES
[1:23:20] <dekkitout> we get it, you thought eva were hype as shit
[1:23:22] <deviljhojho94> BIO TERROR
[1:23:25] <%stigna1> @VidulaSaix Oooooohhh, that makes so much sense.
[1:23:25] <%AcidicHorizon> WARFRAMES IS PEOPLE
[1:23:35] <AncelDeLambert> "failures"
[1:23:37] <Goergorion> @AngriestPat Read the Rhino Prime bio!
[1:23:37] <%Mornaka> cheer200 you may suck at board games but I still think you're an ok guy
[1:23:40] <cerberuscarmine> *slaps the top of umbra* this baby can fit so much infestation
[1:23:42] <%MagickBurritoh> hunHoe
[1:23:43] <+Rivet95> Zombie robots!
[1:23:45] <gryffinp> So the real reveal here is that the Warframes predate the Tenno
[1:23:45] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Okay so the deal is , the warframes were clones robots fighitng for them but without the tenno they couldn't be controlled and just went nuts.
[1:23:45] <+RushUnplugged> literally EVAs
[1:23:47] <AncelDeLambert> They weren't complete slaves, FAILURE
[1:23:48] <panchetekills> WARFRAMES ARE EVAS, UMBRA IS SHINJIS MOM
[1:23:51] <OrochiSheewa> I want gramps Hunhow, sentient destroyer of worlds, to read me a bedtime story
[1:23:51] <Graxe_> Warframes are just failed Uroboros experiments.
[1:23:54] <%pennykettle_> look at these wallpapers
[1:23:56] <%sassyquatch963> these audiologs take place before the second dream
[1:24:02] <+GuelermeDias> i cant believe pat is an eva
[1:24:03] <%Deekman> what's the void?
[1:24:04] <+VidulaSaix> @Gogogolem Super wrong
[1:24:06] <Goergorion> The Rhino Prime Bio has more stuff!
[1:24:06] <ape_hawk> ahahaha
[1:24:06] <deviljhojho94> Ordis you worthless shit
[1:24:08] <+GuelermeDias> he finally realized his dream
[1:24:09] <%Mornaka> BOOOOOOOO
[1:24:11] <+shaderichter_belmont> and now we learn who has been spinning the wheels behind the scenes all along
[1:24:13] <RevenTheLight> boooo
[1:24:14] <loganzeri> pat wat is your cape please
[1:24:19] <Batvision> Ballas was the one who told the sentients about where the operator is
[1:24:22] <iusetheinternet> the void is basically space magic shit
[1:24:25] <%Gogogolem> @VidulaSaix I was asking
[1:24:26] <+Ssaik> @AngriestPat Just to put that in some context, whenyou built Ordis you 3D-printed something approximating a person
[1:24:27] <iusetheinternet> its mostly vague now
[1:24:28] <TheInkshow> Bollas is a traitor
[1:24:31] <+Ssaik> Ordis?
[1:24:33] <+Ssaik> Umbra
[1:24:34] <californaya> the ship can just turn on/off emotions at will?
[1:24:35] <AncelDeLambert> I HATE the voice acting on the operators
[1:24:38] <californaya> I wish I could do that
[1:24:41] <+yet_another_brony> THE VOID? LIKE HOLLOW KNIGHT?
[1:24:42] <%pennykettle_> stop explaining the fuckin story that he is getting right now, let him get it all before you explain it
[1:24:42] <%sassyquatch963> the void is the space between places
[1:24:44] <PsychedelicSnake> I SEE THE BABY
[1:24:45] <ape_hawk> never trust someone named Ball Ass
[1:24:46] <+VidulaSaix> The male operators vocies suck. Females sounds fine
[1:24:47] <KTDelgado> tldr; proto warframes are subjects that hqve been subjected to the infestation virus similar to helmlith but these were mindless golem with no commanding order
[1:24:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @californaya normally on, but he got reformatted
[1:24:49] <KatabolicRage> ballas was basically recording some big secrets for hunhow there
[1:24:51] <%sassyquatch963> like warpscapce
[1:24:52] <+Thorn14> Dont worry the game's unimportant
[1:24:53] <cerberuscarmine> ITS DAH BAAAAABY
[1:24:53] <%OceanGovernor> The Void like the Warp
[1:24:55] <%PatNTheHat> @Ancel MY WURFRUM IS STRUNG
[1:24:56] <%sassyquatch963> warspace
[1:24:57] <AncelDeLambert> the Void is MAGIC
[1:24:59] <PsychedelicSnake> OOOOO DA BABY
[1:25:01] <KatabolicRage> o hai sentients
[1:25:01] <loganzeri> please some one share i need that cape info
[1:25:02] <laserbeaming> MY WARFRAME IS STRONG
[1:25:02] <+Dasbubba> Owl sounds fine to me.
[1:25:03] <Nekros4442> Stop explaining things until we get to the end
[1:25:05] <KTDelgado> WORST ORDIS
[1:25:05] <+rose_silver> did I miss the cyberpunk demo yet?
[1:25:09] <PsychedelicSnake> Heron > Owl
[1:25:12] <AncelDeLambert> @patnthehat LUL
[1:25:12] <ape_hawk> no
[1:25:13] <+Cobalt_Racer> it's babby
[1:25:15] <Loope_of_Calamity> Is there any way i can just snort Cyberpunk 2077!? it looks so good!
[1:25:16] <iusetheinternet> no you didnt rose
[1:25:17] <ravencloak13> @rose_silver Not yet
[1:25:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat because he hates the Warframes
[1:25:20] <$magikestral> did pat do the ordis quest offscreen
[1:25:21] <sunny935> raven is best
[1:25:23] <%boarqueen> bc ballas is a dumb babby
[1:25:23] <cizal11> because the orokin were bigger dicks
[1:25:24] <EASrake> that's what you doing too pat
[1:25:24] <vierleger> Pat is doing CP2077 after the warfarm
[1:25:24] <+ginnyfield> his arm is still unexplained
[1:25:24] <KatabolicRage> golden hyperdecedence will do that I guess
[1:25:24] <panchetekills> LONG BOI
[1:25:24] <Skybrid> He just said it previously
[1:25:26] <%Divryne> He jerked off to much.
[1:25:28] <$Mendin> Ladies love the long one
[1:25:29] <cerberuscarmine> he got dat LONG ARM
[1:25:29] <+GuelermeDias> ballas was secretly stretch armstrong
[1:25:29] <+Valison> Ballas the Ball-ass
[1:25:31] <+VidulaSaix> Ballas wasnt recording stuff for Hunhow, he was talknig directly TO Hunhow and Umbra was monitoring it and saved it to expose him, but Ballas found out and thats whats happening in these flashbacks you keep seeing
[1:25:31] <viewtifulr> Balles might as well be Gilgamesh from fate
[1:25:31] <KTDelgado> EITHER GIVE ME ORDAN KARN OR FULL CEPHAON ORDIS
[1:25:31] <+GuelermeDias> all allong
[1:25:32] <%Sxy_T_Rex> It's the long arm of the ball
[1:25:32] <superbla25> its for sex
[1:25:34] <+pswayde> Ballas went to the sentients because his kind killed his love, Margulis
[1:25:35] <%Mornaka> Dude's busy
[1:25:36] <fairore> @anceldelambert get on that mic and start voice acting then
[1:25:38] <%riantDeliration> oh boy
[1:25:46] <%GarbageNirvana> he yell
[1:25:48] <dekkitout> but golden hyperdecadence is SO good
[1:25:51] <AncelDeLambert> No, I have self-esteem
[1:25:54] <+Dasbubba> Because the other orokin killed his beloved.
[1:25:54] <+crackheadcontrol> "What's up with your creepy arm?" says the psychic boy inhabiting the infested prisoner twisted into an eyeless lizard god
[1:25:54] <Worldbrand> oh i didnt know they could stagger through negation swarm
[1:25:54] <+velemi> Pat, you missed an ayatan
[1:25:54] <PsychedelicSnake> Why is Pat reading the chat during the quest anyways
[1:25:56] <loganzeri> please pat wat is the name of his cape
[1:26:01] <+AXL808> Isn't it that Corpus are decedents of Orokin and Grineer were freed by Sentients?
[1:26:02] <alpharius88> betray its like an orokin pass time
[1:26:02] <DarkKnightGrave> MORE PROP HUNT
[1:26:07] <%MagickBurritoh> Inaros: Ow that smarts
[1:26:11] <RevenTheLight> @ginnyfield I think it says somewhere that Orokin doctors had the arm... for reasons...?
[1:26:12] <%pennykettle_> everything is descendants of orokin
[1:26:14] <AncelDeLambert> through the box, wow
[1:26:14] <+Ssaik> Why would a mimic pose as Nano Spores nobody goes for Nano Spores
[1:26:20] <+AntithesisEK> corpus were the lower merchant class @AXL808
[1:26:23] <talisign> Everything is a mimic.
[1:26:26] <+GuelermeDias> no puzzle just gun
[1:26:28] <deviljhojho94> Orokin more like morokin amiright fellas
[1:26:30] <arcaderabbit48> @crackheadcontrol Dont forget the part about controlling scarabs and dissolving in to a living sandstorm
[1:26:30] <+GuelermeDias> gun is real
[1:26:32] <+AntithesisEK> some of them are very old eg enough to remember orokin rule
[1:26:32] <+HelloImTom08> GO go down, shootin go UP
[1:26:34] <californaya> ur mum is a mimic
[1:26:35] <%MagickBurritoh> just G R I N D
[1:26:35] <%Gogogolem> Pats back to no strategy and big guns.
[1:26:39] <ravencloak13> And now were Prey reboot
[1:26:40] <+minotaurhead> I like how inaros just kinda laughs at the prospect of taking damage
[1:26:45] <laserbeaming> Inaros is so damn immortal
[1:26:47] <%PatNTheHat> Grineer were inadvertantly freed by the sentients,a s the Orokin did not have the forces to maintain control of their clone slaves
[1:26:48] <+minotaurhead> he's a good frame.
[1:26:50] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Hey, you know what has a big creepy arm? A infested ancients.
[1:26:54] <loganzeri> wat is pats cape?
[1:26:54] <+Gorgen> Inaros is banished from death.
[1:26:59] <dekkitout> inaros and nidus; pillarframes
[1:27:01] <%Gogogolem> Are we sure pats not american
[1:27:07] <PsychedelicSnake> Almost like they adapt or something
[1:27:07] <flying_man_3> Grineer rebelled on their own and corpus are the lower less genetically perfected caste of the orokin society
[1:27:08] <Firefly1009> con-cuh-list
[1:27:10] <deviljhojho94> Pat is an honorary american
[1:27:22] <%MagickBurritoh> he likes bag milk: proof he's not american
[1:27:23] <deviljhojho94> An honorary Ussie, if you will
[1:27:24] <+SomeSortOfMagic> so waht frame is he uisng
[1:27:29] <%OceanGovernor> Didnt the Queens lead the Grineer out after the fall of the Orokin?
[1:27:30] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Inaros
[1:27:31] <%stigna1> @SomeSortOfMagic Inaros.
[1:27:45] <%GarbageNirvana> mummyboy
[1:27:48] <laserbeaming> Pat becomes American the moment he marries Paige. So he'll never be american Kappa
[1:27:50] <%Mornaka> KICK HIS ASS SEABASS
[1:27:52] <glork1234> @oceangovernor yup
[1:27:58] <dekkitout> deplete his shields, wish i had mag rn cruPF
[1:28:00] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat HAVE FUN HERE
[1:28:00] <%Superstarsage> God i can't believe i did this without any amps back in the day
[1:28:01] <%Divryne> LUL
[1:28:02] <KatabolicRage> well that or your amp is very weak
[1:28:02] <PsychedelicSnake> Nah you're jsut very weak Pat
[1:28:05] <+HelloImTom08> this part is ResidentSleeper
[1:28:05] <%stigna1> He screm.
[1:28:06] <bwong1231> the operator fights are not very great
[1:28:07] <AncelDeLambert> Plot armor
[1:28:07] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Helios F
[1:28:08] <RevenTheLight> This is SO MUCH faster then the mote amp
[1:28:10] <Skybrid> He's like the greatest warrior of all time
[1:28:11] <%Gogogolem> Paige has infected him with AMERICA!
[1:28:11] <$TheNeedlesD> run like the coward
[1:28:12] <cerberuscarmine> hes a good boy
[1:28:14] <TheInkshow> THIS IS THE WORST
[1:28:17] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> this boss fight fucking SUCKS
[1:28:20] <+ginnyfield> i did this with the mote, it was the worst
[1:28:21] <%riantDeliration> the health waybounds are very nice here
[1:28:22] <%ThatRandomGuy661> This is the part that people warned you about I think
[1:28:27] <kiri_sute_gomen> the stun lock is really horrible
[1:28:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat ALT FIRE IS BETTER
[1:28:29] <%PatNTheHat> So I never really bothered with the Plains of Eidelon and let me tell you that this quest SUCKED without an amp
[1:28:31] <Tucker0603> this fight is shit
[1:28:34] <KatabolicRage> remmember that crouching into the void makes you hard to hit
[1:28:35] <AncelDeLambert> it helps to use THE INVISIBILITY Pat
[1:28:36] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> this with a mote amp is GARBAGE
[1:28:36] <Ropcord> 250 operator health LUL
[1:28:36] <PsychedelicSnake> Operator Waybounds and Arcanes would help your survivability here, Pat
[1:28:37] <%GarbageNirvana> wtf does transference static even do
[1:28:38] <laserbeaming> Javelins!
[1:28:38] <Zombrocom> This boss fight is much easier when your operator has a ton of armour and 1100 health
[1:28:38] <+velemi> Imagine this fight with Mote
[1:28:39] <Loope_of_Calamity> he is a beast!
[1:28:39] <$Mendin> These fights are "So Exalted Blade spam as an Excalibur was fun, right? NOW BE IN THE RECEIVING SIDE"
[1:28:42] <+Gorgen> This fight was a problem?
[1:28:43] <+GuelermeDias> the mote amp here is pain, yeah
[1:28:43] <+AntithesisEK> reduces frame HP
[1:28:43] <KTDelgado> IF ONLY HIS AI WAS THIS AGGRESSIVE
[1:28:46] <%stigna1> @GarbageNirvana Lowers shields.
[1:28:46] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @ThatRandomGuy661 this fight happens twice,so yeah
[1:28:46] <%Codename_Torch> @AngriestPat tip, hag from the rafters above, he wont be able to get him and you can cheat this
[1:28:47] <+Dasbubba> Actually didn’t have to much trouble with this with the default mote amp. Just teleport across the room when he gets close. Rinse repeat.
[1:28:50] <Skybrid> E
[1:28:51] <EASrake> Use your damn alt fire
[1:28:51] <%ECRead> I came to aPatDab at you
[1:28:55] <sunny935> if only he went with vazarin
[1:29:02] <%GarbageNirvana> @stigna1 oh no however will Inaros cope
[1:29:03] <%ECRead> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:29:04] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Did this entire quest with the *** was literally the fucking worst
[1:29:09] <acridPaladin> Altfire does 9000 to him with greater range
[1:29:10] <laserbeaming> Blast when you deplete his shield

[1:34:48] <+pswayde> Also its known that Orokins hate symmetry
[1:34:48] <Firefly1009> ballas is just a freakazoid
[1:34:48] <+ginnyfield> ballas is...unique
[1:34:49] <Worldbrand> For reacharounds

[1:34:51] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat For fappin
[1:34:51] <KingOfTheGeats> Ballas was into some kinky shit
[1:34:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> blue? hes silver
[1:34:51] <ravencloak13> Kind of a bluish greay
[1:34:53] <PsychedelicSnake> Ballas is an asshole because he's the only Orokin that looks like a freak
[1:34:53] <+crackheadcontrol> if you scan ten ancient healers for simaris you learn about the creepy arms
[1:34:53] <glork1234> Some of them
[1:34:54] <+House_Of_Rage> Because he thinks it makes him Perfect Pat
[1:34:54] <Lysdexic9541> It's for sex
[1:34:54] <%PatNTheHat> Ballas betrayed the Orokin for the same reason the Tenno did apparently. Although the Tenno didn't also SENTENCE HER TO DIE
[1:34:55] <+Reevesypoo> He wanted to be unique compared to everyone else
[1:34:55] <thelaxinator> They
[1:34:55] <NonAddictiveSlurm> Ballas is part Karma Charger
[1:34:55] <Meneliki> We dont know yet why his arm is the way it is
[1:34:56] <TehMud> He's a weirdo
[1:34:56] <%MrDrayko> Corpus are orikin remember @AngriestPat
[1:34:56] <Karhax> Ballas has his bio arm
[1:34:56] <SpaceCatStation> yaoi hands are the natural human progression
[1:34:56] <%Keansor> "I let my wife die and now YOU MUST WATCH YOUR SON DIE FOREVER TO FEEL MY PAIN!!!"
[1:34:56] <+Gorgen> The Grinner queens are orokins remember?
[1:34:56] <%stigna1> There was a caste of Orokin who used certain tech, given the arms.
[1:34:57] <+skibbz_> I like to think all Orokin had it tbh. it's neat and weird
[1:34:57] <flying_man_3> the Tenno werent that great either wit hthe parent murder and all
[1:34:57] <UvBenServed> That arm is for space mom
[1:34:58] <$floridianman> thats just him
[1:34:58] <KnivesEve> theyre both creepy dumb arms
[1:34:58] <viewtifulr> you cant explain vaporwave
[1:34:58] <+greatersea> @AngriestPat canon explanation for the arm is void energy exposure
[1:34:58] <ammobasket> it's armor
[1:34:59] <aeonicvector> he's mutated to "perfection"
[1:34:59] <laserbeaming> Ballas likes being a weirdo
[1:35:00] <+darkmithrionx> he a skinny daaaad
[1:35:00] <%pennykettle_> @AngriestPat
[1:35:00] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> He has the Prototype arm
[1:35:00] <Worldbrand> He like give big hug
[1:35:01] <cerberuscarmine> its cuz he loves being creepy
[1:35:01] <Theta_Bug> Just him, he has sentient stuff in him, and used sense manipulation tech to fool others
[1:35:02] <OrochiSheewa> only thing we know for sure is that they had golden eyes
[1:35:02] <thelaxinator> They're all unique
[1:35:02] <%SolitudeOtM> Orokin are just Human

[1:35:08] <+Shaggnar> They look like what they want to look like
[1:35:09] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat All orokins freaks regardless
[1:35:09] <%pennykettle_> @AngriestPat have you noticed that the infested healers have a big arm
[1:35:10] <+GuelermeDias> need big arms for fapping when you got a huge dick
[1:35:10] <%Daigrey> so he can never get to swole to reach his dick
[1:35:11] <%mordred_t> To be fair to Ballas, if he hadn't sentenced Marghulis to death, he would have been commiting heresy himself, and face similar judgement.
[1:35:11] <+luftraumm1> mainly genetic experiments, as implied in silver grove
[1:35:12] <dekkitout> space chads be like that yo
[1:35:12] <%OceanGovernor> Margulis really dug that long arm
[1:35:12] <glork1234> Future Aesthetics?
[1:35:12] <Tucker0603> it is his fisting arm
[1:35:12] <+ArchimerDreatect> @AngriestPat Not gonna lie, Ballas doesnt seem like a 'model Orokin' just a heads up ( i know he all we got but ehhhh)
[1:35:14] <+SwdVengeance> New meaning to 'the stranger'
[1:35:14] <Rellim80> Y do u?
[1:35:15] <+shaderichter_belmont> Orokin are just Gods
[1:35:15] <+Laecerelius> They're all creepy freakazoids because of their super genetic engineering
[1:35:15] <cerberuscarmine> for dah wahmen
[1:35:16] <aeonicvector> so he can hover arm SEVERAL Girls
[1:35:16] <+Thorn14> Ballas is a weirdo

[1:35:20] <keksisblyat> WTF WERE YOU EXPECTING?
[1:35:21] <+pswayde> Orokin are post-human

[1:35:27] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat See, the orokin love the concept of symmetry. Running theory is that ballas is deliberatly going against that because he hates the orokin
[1:35:27] <KatabolicRage> well yanno, they bodysnatch a nice young body, they wanna spruce it up a bit, maybe make it blue
[1:35:27] <ravencloak13> @flying_man_3 That was self defense!

[1:48:03] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> ITS SO BUSTED
[1:48:04] <$Mendin> EXALTED BLADE TIME
[1:48:04] <Giothegame> It's pretty much Excalibur aside from Radial Howl
[1:48:05] <Festiveface> @AngriestPat the sword makes you invisible, not umbra btw
[1:48:06] <+GuelermeDias> that's the 4
[1:48:09] <+Rivet95> He's real powerful. REAL powerful.
[1:48:11] <Skybrid> AKA Sword of Brokening
[1:48:12] <+Grayhammatter> nope, he has never used a nikana
[1:48:13] <%PatNTheHat> Yeah, the sword turns you invisible when you do a finisher
[1:48:16] <CertainlySyrix> @prismaticsnake Ash Prime is still pretty overpowered
[1:48:17] <TheMrTwisted> his sword also has a really cool dax skin
[1:48:21] <Aleate> Too bad the swords stats are butts Keepo
[1:48:22] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> anyway time to bail out
[1:48:26] <%SolitudeOtM> Get that cephalon fragment you fuck
[1:48:29] <%MagickBurritoh> perfect sword for ash
[1:48:30] <aeonicvector> it's a meh sword with a cool gimmick
[1:48:32] <Skybrid> @Aleate It's pretty good
[1:48:32] <+Gorgen> sword is as strong as normal nikana
[1:48:36] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> @Aleate invisibility on kill is worth it
[1:48:37] <TropicalPsychosis> @Aleate Blood rush crit build
[1:48:38] <%sassyquatch963> good sword for banshee
[1:48:42] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat Go get that cephalon fragment you fuck
[1:48:42] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Umbra gets special buff if he is using swords. his katana is reallllllyyyy good for him
[1:48:43] <+junipxr> y'all are whack it's beast with condition overload
[1:48:45] <KatabolicRage> so people always did wander what warframes actually are, even after second dream, now you know I guess!
[1:48:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat that sword on Ash is way OP

[1:49:00] <+Enkiridian> that dax skin for the sword is too expensive
[1:49:12] <%Superstarsage> didn't you get the free ash prime?
[1:49:12] <%boarqueen> they fixed the price for the dax skin
[1:49:14] <viewtifulr> nearly down

[1:49:15] <%Jpdodds> you dont have him
[1:49:16] <Ropcord> not anymore, it's like 40p now like the rest of the skins

[1:49:16] <%pennykettle_> they just gave away ash prime
[1:49:16] <%Jpdodds> ?
[1:49:18] <aeonicvector> also @AngriestPat hope you got some endo
[1:49:19] <CertainlySyrix> @Enkiridian They lowered the price of it.
[1:49:19] <dekkitout> did he get the free ash prime?
[1:49:19] <iusetheinternet> @Enkiridian they patched it to be lower
[1:49:20] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> wait did you not gee the ash prime givaway?
[1:49:20] <Skybrid> I use it on my Ninja Banshee
[1:49:20] <TheInkshow> Ash is OP with daggers
[1:49:21] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Enkiridian They changed it like 40 p
[1:49:22] <Zombrocom> Ash can just turn invis anyway
[1:49:22] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Should've gotten Ash Prime!
[1:49:22] <cerberuscarmine> you didnt get the free prime one?
[1:49:24] <cerberuscarmine> wat
[1:49:24] <$TheNeedlesD> did he miss out on Ash Prime?
[1:49:25] <+SWindleFeD> This is cool and all but it still seems like the Warframe team is winging it on the story
[1:49:26] <%President_Miyazaki> Because of the scarf right?

[1:50:06] <damienlunas> It's been a while since I played Warframe. Is Excalibur's strategy still "Hit exalted blade then mash attack as fast as humanly possible until your screen is filled with particle effects and you can't see"?
[1:50:07] <+AXL808> He starts maxed because he was working while you slept
[1:50:07] <%HRDSalami654> He's basically a better Excalibur Prime.

[1:51:08] <Skybrid> @AngriestPat These mods will make your Inaros even more broken
[1:51:08] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> SET BONUS
[1:51:09] <KatabolicRage> slap a vitality on that bitch
[1:51:09] <+jestrfestr> have fun maxing those
[1:51:09] <TyrantBelial> Umbra mods are the strongest
[1:51:10] <bwong1231> basically primed
[1:51:11] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat Tau is Sentient stuff.
[1:51:11] <Inebriateddonut> Put that shit on Inaros
[1:51:13] <+velemi> DON'T FORMA THOSE SLOTS TO ANYTHING ELSE
[1:51:15] <+shaderichter_belmont> and they all grant resistance to sentients
[1:51:16] <arcaderabbit48> DISREGARD SPACE MOM, ACQUIRE GUN
[1:51:17] <+preppyposs> they aint maxed
[1:51:17] <+RushUnplugged> they are only half leveled
[1:51:20] <+TootPirate> And their only half rank
[1:51:23] <acridPaladin> Make sure you DONT remove those Umbra slots
[1:51:24] <laserbeaming> Umbral mods are godly for Inaros and Oberon @AngriestPat
[1:51:26] <%AcidicHorizon> Umbral mods are weird
[1:51:26] <%Superstarsage> he's already formaed too
[1:51:26] <%HRDSalami654> The mods are really good.
[1:51:28] <thelaxinator> Umbral mods mostly suck unless you use them together and the point costs are insane on any other frame since only umbra has that polarity
[1:51:28] <%Superstarsage> er, potatoed
[1:51:29] <+Cobaltor_252> @AngriestPat congrats, you got 3 new primed mods to upgrade
[1:51:31] <Worldbrand> tbh max intensify and then wait for the other two, no one gets access to umbral polarities
[1:51:31] <+greatersea> gotta get that efficiency
[1:51:31] <fmc009> @AngriestPat forma him to get energy siphon, free energy
[1:51:34] <Theta_Bug> Don't remove those slots
[1:51:35] <gryffinp> Note that Umbra starts rank 30 AND potatoed
[1:51:36] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Also Nidus
[1:51:36] <KatabolicRage> when I have a half assed frame I always vitality them
[1:51:37] <kiri_sute_gomen> He has five polarities you don't need forma lol
[1:51:39] <Zombrocom> Those umbra mods have unique polarities dont forma those out
[1:51:43] <TyrantBelial> duration and efficiency is enough on hin get that
[1:51:44] <bwong1231> you cant add umbra slots
[1:51:44] <+unfoldingchoas> fleeting
[1:51:45] <%PatNTheHat> Umbral mods are also pretty good on Rhino and Saryn
[1:51:45] <TheInkshow> Efficence+streng
[1:51:46] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> DON'T REMOVE THE SLOTS, YOU CAN'T GET THEM BACK
[1:51:48] <AncelDeLambert> gonna need those slots next quest, Pat, bet on it

[1:51:54] <DarkKnightGrave> Those Mods are disgusting on Inaros.
[1:51:56] <+Grayhammatter> big stank
[1:51:57] <+Rivet95> You can never reformat the umbral slots.

[1:53:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you can mod it now
[1:53:56] <KatabolicRage> I keep forgetting that exists
[1:53:57] <bwong1231> also dont forget to mod exalted blade
[1:53:59] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> ITS THE BEST
[1:53:59] <+Thorn14> Because its amazing
[1:53:59] <DivineDragoonKain> exalted blade is THE reason to use Excalibur
[1:54:00] <kiri_sute_gomen> because exalted weapons are some OP shit
[1:54:00] <+HelloImTom08> need range for his stun ppl FailFish
[1:54:01] <Zombrocom> Exalted blade is amazing
[1:54:01] <+Valison> Exalted blade is your best ability
[1:54:02] <acridPaladin> Excals sword is stupidly strong. Thats why
[1:54:02] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @AngriestPat because it's fucking broken god tier
[1:54:03] <Festiveface> chromatic blade is great
[1:54:04] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Because it's literally the best
[1:54:05] <laserbeaming> Power is strong on exalted weapons
[1:54:06] <Worldbrand> EB hits quite hard
[1:54:06] <+Thorn14> its literally the reason you use him
[1:54:07] <%mordred_t> Because Exalted Blade is his best ability and affects his 1.
[1:54:07] <%President_Miyazaki> You want more efficiency.
[1:54:07] <glork1234> @patnthehat I'd say hunter adrenaline
[1:54:08] <SpankyMagoo> upgrade those umbral mods as well
[1:54:09] <+beautyfulman> @AngriestPat Exalted weapons can do ludicrous damage
[1:54:09] <+velemi> Have you PLAYED excal?
[1:54:10] <%Jp3g95> Dont you have sword lasers?
[1:54:10] <+Rivet95> You *mod* exalted blade. It's awesome.
[1:54:12] <Skybrid> Exalted Blade + Blind/Howl wreck everything @AngriestPat
[1:54:13] <%Lordgale119> Exalted Weapons are the strongest in the game
[1:54:15] <ROBOSAPION6499> where do you get blind rage?
[1:54:15] <%sassyquatch963> exalted weapons are crazy
[1:54:17] <fmc009> @AngriestPat You can add mods to exalted weapons
[1:54:18] <Festiveface> range is very good on excal for blind @AngriestPat
[1:54:19] <dekkitout> "Bro, do you even Excal?"
[1:54:22] <+VidulaSaix> Using Excalibur and not using Exalted Blade is basically using a WF with zero abilities
[1:54:22] <KatabolicRage> cos if you mod the blade right it's crazy strong
[1:54:23] <%President_Miyazaki> Sure, that build works.
[1:54:23] <kiri_sute_gomen> PAT, EXALTED WEAPON HAVE BIG NUMBER
[1:54:24] <+BeatH7> @AngriestPat put on umbra rage and ransient foriude
[1:54:26] <bwong1231> Exalted weapons are modded like another weapon

[1:54:27] <fmc009> PAT RANGE FOR ZE STUN
[1:54:31] <+beautyfulman> @AngriestPat Like, by a wide margin the highest damage in the game, potentially
[1:54:32] <+BeatH7> or huneradrenaline
[1:54:33] <laserbeaming> Looks good for now
[1:54:35] <%President_Miyazaki> Now upgrade those Umbrals.
[1:54:35] <%AcidicHorizon> You kinda want a quality build
[1:54:36] <cizal11> also check your new melee weapon
[1:54:36] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> NO SHIELD
[1:54:37] <sunny935> blind rage just makes everything more energy costly though
[1:54:38] <%Superstarsage> You could reaaaallyyy use rage on there or you're not gonna be exalting a lot
[1:54:40] <TyrantBelial> Get rid of all corrupted mods.
[1:54:41] <+SwdVengeance> @AngriestPat Both Eff and Duration affect Exalted Blade energy drain while drawn
[1:54:44] <Shinmaddrox> Power up your Ubral mods
[1:54:45] <Firefly1009> please shield
[1:54:45] <KatabolicRage> shields are useless anyways, waste of a slot

[1:54:52] <Tucker0603> HUNTER ADRENALINE
[1:54:53] <KatabolicRage> shields are bypassed by several damage types
[1:54:54] <%stigna1> Folks, shields are actively bad.
[1:54:55] <aeonicvector> Adrenaline?
[1:54:55] <CertainlySyrix> you do though
[1:54:55] <Theta_Bug> just get transient fortitude instead of blind rage

[1:55:21] <%stigna1> Yo, heavy impact, lets gooo.
[1:55:25] <AncelDeLambert> the umbras are basically primed mods, expensive as HELL to upgrade
[1:55:27] <dekkitout> *slaps hood of redirection* this baby can hold so many sields
[1:55:30] <Tucker0603> YES
[1:55:32] <KatabolicRage> I love it when my 2000 shield frame dies because a single slash proc ignored it and wiped out my 300 health
[1:55:32] <kiri_sute_gomen> just use rage instead of hadrenaline?
[1:55:33] <Seditary> man chat is half trying to help and half trying to troll his ass
[1:55:33] <puhff> Do the cyberpunk
[1:55:35] <%stigna1> @laserbeaming Hunter adrennelin is just a better version of rage.
[1:55:35] <IminyourBase> blind justice

[1:55:38] <%Everpresent_Overseer> "Hmmm" Rell rubbed off on Pat

[1:55:41] <%Superstarsage> god not the spinning one
[1:55:42] <Jmonkey1430> why is cyberpunk in the title?
[1:55:45] <%Daigrey> Blind Justice is Kenshin
[1:55:46] <+AntithesisEK> Try not to burn endo on sacrificial steel. Other things more important.
[1:55:49] <Inebriateddonut> Excuse me wot?
[1:55:50] <+junipxr> ???
[1:55:50] <CertainlySyrix> Blind Justice is the best one though
[1:55:51] <randomp141> Is it just Ultimate Warrior? For it has made the Sacrifice.
[1:55:52] <Zombrocom> Wat
[1:55:53] <+Rivet95> Blind Justice is for nerds
[1:55:56] <%Keansor> I'm not a fan of blind justice either
[1:55:56] <%MagickBurritoh> the pause combo for BJ is real good

[1:56:02] <+shaderichter_belmont> both justice mods are kinda wacky
[1:56:03] <Festiveface> condition overload
[1:56:04] <$Mendin> Is Blind Justice the one that moves you ten feet forward in a combo?
[1:56:04] <kiri_sute_gomen> there are mods on it
[1:56:04] <KatabolicRage> blind justice has issues for spamming while holding other weapons
[1:56:05] <Firefly1009> he has a riven? omg
[1:56:11] <bwong1231> Hybrid build is the way to go Pat
[1:56:12] <B1n0va> WATCH YOUR TOUNGE

[1:56:52] <%Superstarsage> vicious frost, voltaic, vicious scourge
[1:56:52] <cizal11> you could do all this later

[1:57:33] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> UH
[1:57:33] <kiri_sute_gomen> good enough
[1:57:34] <%Everpresent_Overseer> true Steel
[1:57:35] <Firefly1009> puts jagged edge on when he has buzz kill...
[1:57:35] <Worldbrand> It's fine
[1:57:36] <CertainlySyrix> don't worry, pat doesn't know what he's doing
[1:57:36] <kiri_sute_gomen> GOOD ENOUGH

[1:57:40] <+darkmithrionx> BUZZ KILL
[1:57:41] <BigChiefBear> has all that plat but no good mods?!
[1:57:45] <+beautyfulman> @AngriestPat Buzzkill is literally better than jagged edge
[1:57:47] <TheInkshow> meh
[1:57:48] <CertainlySyrix> oh god
[1:57:49] <KatabolicRage> chromatic blade is 50% more status chance on your exalted blade, AND it does elemental damage based on energy colour
[1:57:49] <%Superstarsage> chromatic blade is excal mod turns it pure element based on energy color
[1:57:49] <+shaderichter_belmont> can't wait for the melee rework to delete the stupid combo system
[1:57:50] <Firefly1009> It's fine pat. Just finish the quest
[1:57:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat exalted damage based on energy color
[1:57:51] <%pennykettle_> He doesnt play excal calm your tits guys
[1:57:52] <+darkmithrionx> use buzz kill
[1:57:52] <CertainlySyrix> oh god this really is stupid
[1:57:53] <aeonicvector> it makes your 4 elemental
[1:57:54] <+Rivet95> Chromatic Blade is for the Exalted Weapon.
[1:57:55] <$konekoryugamine> When are you gonna switch to HOLLOW KNOGHT
[1:57:55] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Damage on crit
[1:57:55] <%Sora20030c> you have buzzkill
[1:57:56] <KTDelgado> YOU DONT NEED FURY, YOU HAVE BEREERKER

[1:57:58] <deviljhojho94> !uptime
[1:57:58] <+greatersea> organ shatter
[1:57:58] <Festiveface> @AngriestPat energy colour effects damage on exalted blade like chroma
[1:57:58] <+Wamennoodles> Damn it, I will give you Chromatic blade
[1:57:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 58m .

[1:58:05] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Organ Shatter
[1:58:05] <Worldbrand> It's fine
[1:58:05] <bwong1231> NOW GO
[1:58:06] <%SolitudeOtM> Your ability to mod frames and weapons could use some work
[1:58:07] <%stigna1> @AngriestPat You can mod the Exalted blade independantly of the Skiajati. It has its own page on the loadout screen.
[1:58:11] <laserbeaming> Good enough for now
[1:58:11] <flying_man_3> wow thats some low damage
[1:58:14] <KatabolicRage> also it does 50% more stratus chance with chromatic blade
[1:58:16] <Worldbrand> Just mod it the same way
[1:58:16] <+skibbz_> only if you have the augment for it
[1:58:18] <AncelDeLambert> buzz kill? that's new to me
[1:58:19] <laserbeaming> This is the one that matters
[1:58:20] <hero1151> make corrosive you hack
[1:58:22] <vierleger> my BURNING BLADE
[1:58:23] <cgmerryo> @AngriestPat if you're going to use umbra get condition overload and chromatic blade
[1:58:24] <kiri_sute_gomen> look at the damage
[1:58:28] <kiri_sute_gomen> look how BIG it is
[1:58:28] <+Rivet95> HIGH damage time
[1:58:29] <AncelDeLambert> play more dress-up
[1:58:30] <+luftraumm1> damn im so salt melee ddddddd3.0 will probably nerf blood rush to hell
[1:58:32] <%Fairy_princess77> Welcome to Menu Porn.
[1:58:34] <%Superstarsage> *slaps the roof of exalted blade* this baby can hold so many elements
[1:58:36] <+Eclipse_knight_> @angriestpat slash arent good outside of the shotgun one
[1:58:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> FULL CORROSIVE @AngriestPat

[1:58:38] <bwong1231> put corrosive on it
[1:58:41] <sunny935> where are the dual stat mods at?
[1:58:41] <bwong1231> NO REACH
[1:58:42] <KatabolicRage> one thing to note, your blade waves at range do NOT count for combo counter
[1:58:44] <Karhax> remove reach
[1:58:46] <%AcidicHorizon> BUZZ KILL WHYYYYYY
[1:58:47] <+AntithesisEK> ooooo boi this is eventful
[1:58:47] <cgmerryo> NO REACH
[1:58:47] <%SolitudeOtM> Add rending strike you fuck
[1:58:48] <Festiveface> reach is bad
[1:58:48] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> No reach
[1:58:49] <KatabolicRage> thats ONLY for actually melee
[1:58:49] <+Eclipse_knight_> slash mods*
[1:58:49] <laserbeaming> reach doesn't work with this
[1:58:51] <$TheNeedlesD> Why in gods name would you use reach
[1:58:53] <+greatersea> does... does pat not have organ shatter?
[1:58:56] <gryffinp> "spoiled strike" he said as if that was a perfectly natural thing to include
[1:58:58] <+BeatH7> @AngriestPat status on exalted blade my dude
[1:58:58] <+Gorgen> melts through everything

[1:59:10] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @AngriestPat If you can take the hit to capacity, Umbral mods right now are worse than the basic counterparts. They scale better, but you need to invets.
[1:59:11] <Worldbrand> Might wanna bump the attack speed a bit
[1:59:13] <KatabolicRage> spoiled strike is a "depends" mod
[1:59:15] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Organ Sahtter
[1:59:15] <kiri_sute_gomen> rainbow status mods
[1:59:15] <+AntithesisEK> spoiled strike is fine on EB
[1:59:15] <Zombrocom> It's ok
[1:59:16] <flying_man_3> spoiled strick is only bad on slow weapons
[1:59:17] <DivineDragoonKain> Spoiled strike is fine
[1:59:17] <AncelDeLambert> JAGGED
[1:59:19] <%Superstarsage> Spoiled strike used to be the best thing on a build, but nowadayssss

[2:10:41] <KatabolicRage> display capture suuuucks man
[2:10:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Did I miss Cyberpunk?
[2:10:44] <Lucatiel56> The Orokin's answer to everything is just make more monsters.
[2:10:44] <turf_wind_and_fire> He downloaded the Cyberpunk trailer so that's how we're watching it later
[2:10:45] <%stigna1> "Sometimes I like to put my mouse on top of Kripp's, so its like we're holding hands."
[2:10:46] <+PeaceCentennial> just capture desktop and crop it
[2:10:46] <flying_man_3> you might have to monitor cap because of the GPU acceleration on chrome
[2:10:52] <cizal11> how were you gonna watch cyberpunk if this doesn't work?
[2:10:53] <KatabolicRage> I had to use that once for an old directx 6 game that wouldn't capture
[2:10:53] <%korth367> Capture desktop? @AngriestPat
[2:10:53] <%MrBorisMakarov> Use Edge rooSmug
[2:10:55] <%Nilysila> area capure
[2:10:55] <JDRK> You need to turn off hardware acceleration in chrome for it to be capturable iirc
[2:10:56] <PsychedelicSnake> Pat loves needle porn
[2:10:57] <%ssjklyco> If he's just gonna do a rift track, he may as well watch it on his own time.
[2:10:58] <+Ryan1016> LUL
[2:10:58] <crimsonharvest> why would chrome show up on display capture

[2:19:40] <CorruptDropbear> My current thoughts on Cyberpunk 2077 is that I want WOTC to not be jackasses and let FFG to make Android Netrunner again.
[2:19:41] <damienlunas> also how are the warframes real people if you craft them
[2:19:42] <KatabolicRage> I mean the twitch vod is always there

[2:21:44] <cizal11> umbral yellow
[2:21:44] <%sassyquatch963> does he not know that default warframe colours don't come from pallets?
[2:21:46] <%SolitudeOtM> You might not have it?
[2:21:48] <+centrilion> Use the color wheel!
[2:21:50] <KatabolicRage> man it's difficult to hunt down default colours
[2:21:53] <ravencloak13> @talisign Couldn’t that describe all of our Warframes though?

[2:21:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat defaults are custom
[2:21:56] <doodledumps> Well it's been fun Pat. Enjoy the Cyberpunk 2077 video. Good night everyone, Dumps is OUT

[2:23:17] <Festiveface> @AngriestPat you should look at his extra helmet
[2:23:19] <turf_wind_and_fire> that's a bit better

[2:24:39] <KatabolicRage> is there ANY good agile?
[2:24:40] <+ShogunNoonto> his name is umbra and you make him white ?
[2:24:40] <+willven> cyberpunk 2077 ?
[2:24:41] <demonhunter790> Can I get some words of encouragement? I’m falling apart in my life right now and don’t really have anyone else to go to.
[2:24:46] <DigbyMayor> It's a spoiler for new players though
[2:24:47] <+unfoldingchoas> did pat ever buy the best cosmetic items in the game tegris prime armor or what ever
[2:24:48] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Agile stance is fantastic
[2:24:49] <Gehtingsberg> “Butterflies caressing my naked body” -@angriestpat
[2:24:50] <%AcidicHorizon> there is a jojo pose
[2:24:51] <+FrostMass22> Remember that time Pat said "it felt like a bunch of butterflies caressing my naked body."
[2:24:51] <%PatNTheHat> @AngriestPat It is kind of a spoiler though, the helmet
[2:24:51] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> noble is sick

[2:25:12] <dekkitout> mcskully skulkin
[2:25:14] <+Mexrage> all skins have the cool scarfs
[2:25:15] <NeoJoker316> agile's good, has a nice swipe
[2:25:17] <+Dasbubba> The noble set is really cool if you let it idle long enough. He strikes a pose and his cape blows in the wind.
[2:25:19] <turf_wind_and_fire> Too much gold for me

[2:25:34] <%Keansor> @demonhunter790 I'd recommend a professional for that, my dude. That costs money though, so if you don't have that option hang in there!
[2:25:36] <KatabolicRage> what the heck man
[2:25:36] <+SpareCakemix> proto skin tho
[2:25:36] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> that gold with a blue not the white

[2:25:55] <%SolitudeOtM> Dex Skin is pretty cool
[2:25:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> Exaltation @AngriestPat

[2:25:59] <+Mexrage> he have all the normal umbra skins
[2:26:02] <NonAddictiveSlurm> is that proto armor Grey Fox
[2:26:05] <KatabolicRage> excal has so many that I think they should stop and let others get some in
[2:26:07] <+Gorgen> look at the helmet
[2:26:08] <Inebriateddonut> Proto is good tho
[2:26:09] <Ropcord> you skipped exaltation FeelsBadMan
[2:26:09] <dekkitout> look at all these genji skins
[2:26:10] <+jestrfestr> free, yearly

[2:26:25] <%pennykettle_> I love the dex helmet
[2:26:27] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> is it just me or is the noble not animating correctly?
[2:26:27] <+velemi> BAD TASTE
[2:26:29] <+rorschachsjournal505> Caduto, Dex, and Exalted are the best. Aside from Normal Umbra.
[2:26:30] <Worldbrand> What you don't like king crimson?
[2:26:30] <zamzoph> DEX DansGame
[2:26:31] <%Sackroad> Pat needs them arcane helmets.

[2:26:36] <%MagickBurritoh> Proto armor best
[2:26:36] <nexus152> has he watched cyberpunk yet?
[2:26:37] <%pennykettle_> PogChamp
[2:26:38] <+darknessturkey> skins are only half the battle, you gotta have good colors too
[2:26:41] <GoldeNOVA> Sunder!
[2:26:41] <turf_wind_and_fire> That looks SICK AS SHIT
[2:26:42] <+coolthulhuu> since excalibur has the most skins
[2:26:42] <%BioApple> I don't remember having these, I sure hope they weren't time-locked
[2:26:43] <demonhunter790> :)
[2:26:44] <%stigna1> @RollTheD20 But it is tho. I say as a Warframe player.

[2:27:17] <Theta_Bug> Oh yeah, you can cosplay artorias with umbra PogChamp
[2:27:18] <%Sackroad> Does Pat know about the old arcane helmets? The ones that gave you buffs?
[2:27:18] <$Pigg1yJuffs> WHY IS LOTUS LIKE THAT? WHAT HAPPENED? OH GOD I NEED TO GET CAUGHT UP WITH WARFRAME.
[2:27:18] <iusetheinternet> @IMDRanged its the steam version pats using a ps4 controller
[2:27:21] <+WhyIDie> arturius seems better if you use the big cape and decently big shoulder armor
[2:27:25] <%Keansor> @RollTheD20 And hours upon hours of your time
[2:27:25] <Mockisho> I wish you could remove the Umbra accessories when using skins like the Proto Armor skin.

[2:29:25] <%Keansor> Gives me a similar vibe to him anyways
[2:29:26] <KatabolicRage> don't think proto meshes well with umbras unique bits
[2:29:27] <Fabric_tester> Pendragon helmet is really good
[2:29:27] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> yup!
[2:29:28] <%whistlehunter> The arm is the best part

[2:29:51] <%Sackroad> @AngriestPat Has anyone told you about the old Arcane Helmets that give your frames buffs? Rhino has one that boosts his speed for example.

[2:30:35] <Ropcord> ronin is amazing on regular excal and not so much on umbra
[2:30:39] <Mockisho> Does anyone else think that Excalibur Umbra has a great butt?
[2:30:41] <dekkitout> no 90's plz, i hated the pouches, shoulderpads, and poorly drawn feet!

[2:30:49] <%stigna1> Oh man, I love Nyx's arcane vespa.
[2:30:49] <TerraWraith> The helmet of the Ronin set is the most frustrating god damn thing. It' snot symmetrical, but only just barely.
[2:30:53] <Fabric_tester> Pendragon helmet, try it
[2:30:55] <+darkmithrionx> Dex all the way

[2:34:20] <Festiveface> pat you are my fetish @AngriestPat
[2:34:21] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat its actually neruological, the sensual part of the brain is right next to the part that thinks about feet, so it sometimes connects
[2:34:23] <+yet_another_brony> Hey patt do you like tits? can you explain why scientifically?
[2:34:23] <Shadow__atronach> wait theres a rule about this?!
[2:34:23] <$magikestral> @angriestpat apparently its very common for the pleasure center in the brain is right next to the feet recognizer, and sometimes the lines connect to each other
[2:34:24] <Huntercd> Lady feet are great
[2:34:25] <talisign> Disgusting degenerates with your matching outfits.

[2:34:31] <+Gorgen> do you suck mustard off her feet?
[2:34:34] <elizabethx1998> is this a good game on the ps4?
[2:34:34] <PsychedelicSnake> Matching clothed like real siblings
[2:34:34] <MrSuplexArt> The part of the brain that associates pleasure with the genitals is RIGHT NEXT to the part of the brain the associates feeling in feet. They get crisscrossed
[2:34:35] <+yet_another_brony> we dont always know why
[2:34:36] <%spacekataz18> Feet and toe stuff is nasty and simple to make fun of
[2:34:42] <viciousgrim> @AngriestPat but do you like feet in high-heels?
[2:34:45] <Kaitepaints> Taking putting a foot in your mouth to a whole other level

[2:35:20] <SatansDick1> you didnt
[2:35:20] <KhanOfTrolls> rooKek
[2:35:22] <aeonicvector> i mean, i could teach you, but tbh its not worth it
[2:35:24] <hntronium> Just use your brain
[2:35:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[2:35:26] <%TheGershon> You surround the other pieces in the cardinal directions! That's it!
[2:35:29] <hntronium> Comprehensive thinking Pat
[2:35:29] <dekkitout> !brain at risk!
[2:35:30] <Kaitepaints> Paige don’t tell pat but you’re my favorite shhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2:35:31] <%stigna1> Its funny, actually, I used to play Go with my father before he passed. So thanks, Ballas, I guess. >_>
[2:35:33] <SatansDick1> cool and smart
[2:35:34] <%PatNTheHat> Go is fairly complicated, as board games go

[2:35:36] <Shastafield> sike, you thot
[2:35:36] <Twoiis> You understand fine. You just literally didn't surround it.
[2:35:37] <talisign> No need to pay. Pat's balls were already completely exposed.
[2:35:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat You don't understand teleportation either.
[2:35:45] <%pennykettle_> no you didnt
[2:35:46] <%mordred_t> @AngriestPat What's your Yin/Yang alignment in your Warframe profile?
[2:35:46] <Lazaruz95> Wait what is this about Pat sucking at boardgames?
[2:35:48] <hntronium> NO YOU DIDNT
[2:35:49] <Festiveface> @angriestpat you are my fetish
[2:35:50] <Seditary> you didn't
[2:35:50] <CorruptDropbear> Part of me wants to see him wrap his head around Artifact or Android Netrunner
[2:35:51] <DarkKnightGrave> stroking out huh pat?
[2:35:52] <KatabolicRage> it has to surround him at the end of YOUR turn man
[2:35:52] <+PeaceCentennial> THERE WAS A GAP
[2:35:54] <forlorncarton> You only capture when you place
[2:35:54] <DracaenaLeaf> Do you even hear yourself lmao
[2:35:54] <%pennykettle_> You didnt surround him if IT DIDNT EXIST
[2:35:55] <zal_silverfang> DOESNT WORK
[2:35:55] <%Deekman> apatWrong
[2:35:55] <%BioApple> it procs at the end of the turn
[2:35:55] <Worldbrand> "Would be surrounded" is not surrounded
[2:35:55] <%TheGershon> You haven't seen DEA- I mean, Hikaru no Go?1?
[2:35:55] <%Ragnarok_Flames> 4 sides
[2:35:56] <Caidezes> He's never gonna live this down.
[2:35:56] <%Arxel1> Pat pls
[2:35:57] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> but you ddin't
[2:35:57] <Twoiis> Literally video evidence.
[2:35:57] <SatansDick1> it has to be 4 sides
[2:35:57] <%Spydurman> Yeah cause he putting it down takes priority
[2:35:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you placed yours where YOU were surrounded
[2:35:58] <@Mechz71> You didn not play the game right
[2:35:59] <zal_silverfang> BEFORE
[2:35:59] <%Divryne> It takes priority if his placement captures.
[2:36:01] <aeonicvector> it'd be on 3 sides on your NET turn
[2:36:03] <%sassyquatch963> SURROUNDED ON 3 SIDES? YOU NEED TO SURROUND THEM ON 4
[2:36:03] <%JaydenSai> !uptime
[2:36:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 36m 5s.
[2:36:06] <+velemi> "On three sides" PAT YOU HAVE TO SURROUND 4 SIDES
[2:36:08] <+darkmithrionx> LUL
[2:36:08] <%nitronLVIII> YOU ONLY CAPTURE ON YOUR TURN
[2:36:10] <aeonicvector> yes
[2:36:12] <%Arxel1> Yes its the one Pat
[2:36:12] <$magikestral> yep, its very good
[2:36:15] <%Keansor> Yeah it's a bit more complicated than just surrounded on all sides
[2:36:16] <%immobilecarrot6> git gud
[2:36:16] <StarSkullyman> when did pat play go?
[2:36:19] <Mockisho> That Goh for ya, it doesn't make any sense.

[2:36:30] <SatansDick1> 4 sides pat 4 sides
[2:36:30] <nexus152> when did Pat play fucking go?
[2:36:30] <reonome> because you suck
[2:36:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you placed where YOU were surrounded
[2:36:33] <Shastafield> theres already a free shitty mobile ripoff
[2:36:34] <$magikestral> @starskullyman Warframe got weird
[2:36:35] <KatabolicRage> you were setting up surrounds for his turn, you gotta do it on your turn, the surrounding has to take place when YOU place YOUR piece
[2:36:36] <talisign> Mahjong is the true incomprehensible game.

[2:41:42] <Mockisho> @AngriestPat Just to let you know, that board game was rigged.

[2:42:05] <$Piemono> As long as Pat doesn't whip his dick out it's all copacetic

[2:42:05] <turf_wind_and_fire> "supposed to" and actual practice are two very different things though.
[2:42:05] <Prevot> the ACTUAL rule is that if the game is big enough, they can do anything LUL
[2:42:06] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> neutral tit = it's fine
[2:42:06] <NonAddictiveSlurm> Hobos, that one exception to "eat what you run over with your bus"

[3:06:34] <talisign> I always get a little nervous when a titlecard appears above me
[3:06:35] <+Thorn14> Unlike Deus Ex where a city had like 8 people
[3:06:35] <NeoJoker316> ok! gives me a couple years to get a rig to run this... if it's on PC that is
[3:06:36] <%Agami23> the main character seems short in this demo

[3:07:03] <%TheGershon> No he bought the 2080 TI
[3:07:03] <%stigna1> Ok, is it just me or is this not really all that impressive? Like, game-wise it seems sorta...generic? I dunno.
[3:07:03] <MONSTRx_x> that many NPC will not happen
[3:07:06] <Coystick> @valachi KNEW IT
[3:07:07] <TheMilhouseExperience> 1/5 Witcher 3 map, but with 10 more floors.
[3:07:08] <b1gboss007> No way this is in the game
[3:07:09] <demonhunter790> Don’t buy into hype, remember other games that didn’t live up to hype
[3:07:12] <zal_silverfang> im getting some Elder Scrolls Oblivion flash backs guys with that whole "npcs living fully realized schedules"
[3:07:12] <+Dasbubba> I’d be interested to know the budget on this.
[3:07:15] <Ell1ot> is that Bender?
[3:07:16] <+Thorn14> Witcher 3 lived up to the hype

[3:07:20] <+Spark_Man> I would cut off my legs for robot ones in a heart beat
[3:07:21] <+jezred14> I'm going full on Ghost in the Shell
[3:07:21] <%Keansor> Throughout this whole thing I'm just thinking "Played up for the demo. Played up for the demo. Don't believe the hype. Remember spore."
[3:07:21] <Zantetzuken> this guy has street cred
[3:07:23] <+ParagonXRocky> Pat gets augmented legs so he can reach the top shelf.

[3:15:52] <+Quarkee> mantis arm blades are my aesthetic
[3:15:54] <yodajr99> what happens if you lose all your humanity
[3:15:55] <+shaderichter_belmont> You are a human targeting computer and your eye has machine learning
[3:15:59] <Renkage098> Close enough!
[3:16:03] <Coystick> MASTUBATION AID
[3:16:03] <Djinnazz> Sweet!
[3:16:05] <DSD24> I would probably do this without augs
[3:16:06] <+nolifegamin> If you can't be Raiden in this game then fuck everything
[3:16:08] <talisign> HUD justification!
[3:16:08] <Dovakhin573> Also Some Ghost in the shell shit
[3:16:10] <dekkitout> damage go up!
[3:16:10] <%pennykettle_> So her hand is scanning her gun and sending info to eyes?
[3:16:10] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> How does it increase damage?
[3:16:10] <OkamiDude15> MANTIA ARM BLADES? I WANT NOTHIN TO DO WITH IT! we'll be right back after these commercial messages sfhEZ
[3:16:13] <prismaticsnake> why does it make the bullets hit harder?

[3:16:23] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> deux ex
[3:16:23] <%mornerboi> So if this is a game is about humanity, will Pat be dropping his shield?
[3:16:24] <Lunatyr_> In Shadowrun, you would just not be able to use magic good. I have no idea what humanity cost would do here
[3:16:26] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> bathing has to be a bitch with a hand like that
[3:16:26] <ravencloak13> @dovakhin573 This is actually a lot of Ghost in the Shell shit

[3:16:49] <%Remery_> illegal
[3:16:50] <%Jpdodds> OH HELL YEAH
[3:16:50] <Flyrant> I TOTALLY ASKED FOR THIS
[3:16:53] <%stigna1> Rejection actually makes no sense; graft rejection is based on genetically-carried tags, which machines obviously don't have.
[3:16:54] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @xeros720 yup
[3:16:56] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> JC A BOMB
[3:16:56] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @xeros720 it is

[3:16:59] <+blondie_ow> I hope you can install a laser eye or some crazy shit

[3:19:28] <Mr_Strut> I want this narrator in the base game
[3:19:29] <%Superstarsage> saints row?
[3:19:30] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat put your dick away
[3:19:32] <ChronoJXF> that was intense - but scripted KKona
[3:19:32] <%Keansor> "Actions directly influence" uh-huh that's an interesting way to say scripted events
[3:19:33] <$magikestral> the narrator probably was better when it was a live person at e3
[3:19:34] <C_Sixty_Jam> D: Pendejo again
[3:19:35] <DeviNation13> It's like a Ferarri Delorean
[3:19:36] <Parapattern> That's fucking lies
[3:19:40] <suikudo> no fucking way this coming to console
[3:19:41] <AncelDeLambert> @dsd24 so we're agreed, a twelve year old
[3:19:41] <ravencloak13> @sailingsaturn Dude, what if we can add AI to our car?
[3:19:42] <Stab_master_ars0n> Gta
[3:19:42] <%pennykettle_> isnt this basic videogame mechanics at this point? You angered people and it makes certain events happen? Theyre hyping up like "ITS A LIVING BREATHING WORLD"
[3:19:43] <+DakotaChip> Grand theft auto?
[3:19:43] <+ParagonXRocky> Presumably if you don'
[3:19:44] <+eXtwofour> !uptime
[3:19:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 19m 46s.
[3:19:44] <%GarbageNirvana> How many lines would they have to record for this kind of experience
[3:19:45] <MyNameIsRasus> F A V E L A
[3:19:45] <%Ferakin> Pat has his keyboard over his lap so we won't see his raging boner
[3:19:48] <AtlasMcCoy> MEGACOOOOORPS
[3:19:49] <%whistlehunter> Paige make sure Pat's wearing underwear alright
[3:19:49] <+Thorn14> lmao people thinking this will be on PS4 xbox 1
[3:19:51] <ape_hawk> "DYNAMIC" EVENTS
[3:19:52] <Renkage098> Danger never sleep. And has a fucked up sleep schedule because it was supposed to sleep in the day
[3:19:54] <Sleepology> oh good this is like exactly where i stopped watching the video lol
[3:19:56] <tUxUt> PMC!!!!!
[3:19:56] <ravencloak13> @sailingsaturn He looks like Kits model.
[3:20:00] <%KevinsLunchbox> this game isnt real
[3:20:03] <+ParagonXRocky> There's probably a faction system for various gangs and corps that determines who attacks you randomly.
[3:20:08] <swagswag338> i seriously hope you don't have to go through the whole game with the cholo sidekick
[3:20:09] <%stigna1> Nah, not the dialog or anything. This feels too...responsive/cinematic to by anything but a vertical slice. Or, in other words, lies.
[3:20:11] <CrimsonSkeletons> It's nice that they rebooted Flashback.
[3:20:11] <AncelDeLambert> Decisions have become error
[3:20:12] <thisskasammich> i assume this is cyberpunk 2077?
[3:20:12] <knomad2b> the scope is scary large
[3:20:14] <+PeaceCentennial> megacorps are so cool
[3:20:14] <OkamiDude15> this will absolutely be a next gen
[3:20:19] <%RageKingDomo> i love how chill the Main character is
[3:20:19] <%SergeEXE> is that Wakka?
[3:20:19] <blackorchidKI2> I kinda hate the name Night City. It's so generic sounding
[3:20:20] <DSD24> @AncelDeLambert Plus a full auto pistol is never fun shooting when compared to a regular semi
[3:20:20] <%Agami23> i dont like how the car doors open.
[3:20:22] <SailingSaturn> @ravencloak13 I don't know anything about source Cyberpunk but they should add that
[3:20:22] <AncelDeLambert> @swagswag338 ditto
[3:20:22] <iusetheinternet> when do we get attacked by thrak the orc cook?
[3:20:24] <giventothegrave> scripted or not it was fucking cool, get the stick out of your asses
[3:20:24] <%SergeEXE> I think that's Wakka
[3:20:31] <C_Sixty_Jam> VoHiYo Kiroshi
[3:20:36] <+shaderichter_belmont> you can't trust a corp, no exceptions
[3:20:37] <talisign> I hope the cholo sidekick has the most dialog just to spite everyone else
[3:20:39] <%MrBorisMakarov> @SergeEXE i think you're right ??
[3:20:39] <sturner202> this game is gonna end up like star citizen and never come out
[3:20:42] <Kingdom_65> Hey Peach you're a stinky lizard
[3:20:42] <CptBritches> Yeah, the name Night City is the lamest part of the entire game
[3:20:44] <Flyrant> nah this will run on ps4/xbox one with some lower res textures/shadows most likey
[3:20:46] <+PeaceCentennial> UNKOWN
[3:20:46] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean even if the final game only resembles this on a surface level it'll still be some pretty cool shit
[3:20:47] <+Thorn14> I trust CD Projekt
[3:20:50] <Renkage098> I would be upset with it being scripted. But it's Project Red. They actually like video games
[3:20:51] <SailingSaturn> of course its scripted but its still great to see cirTan
[3:20:52] <AncelDeLambert> @dsd24 it's literally what someone who's only ever seen The Matrix would think was a good idea
[3:20:52] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> @stigna1 it's scripted a bit, but hopefully not complete lies, given everything else we found out about in the demo
[3:20:53] <Mr_Strut> I love scanning shit
[3:20:54] <+PeaceCentennial> Even SHE'S super strong
[3:20:54] <NGMajora> They have LITERALLY confirmed it'll be on current gen
[3:20:55] <C_Sixty_Jam> SeemsGood
[3:20:57] <Dovakhin573> Jackie is the best screw yall
[3:20:58] <+nolifegamin> I need cholo man to be the real hero we all need
[3:21:01] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> SeemsGood
[3:21:05] <%GarbageNirvana> And CDPR's not been known to bullshit us
[3:21:05] <Mechazoic_Era> SeemsGood
[3:21:05] <InvalidReality> SeemsGood
[3:21:07] <%Roasted_Pheasant> SeemsGood
[3:21:10] <kwangalang> @giventothegrave you can literally do that in gtav
[3:21:11] <%bluescreen1988> Jackies great
[3:21:11] <+Cervarian> @sturner202 why? rooThink
[3:21:11] <+PeaceCentennial> ??
[3:21:11] <DSD24> What are cool names for a city
[3:21:13] <zamzoph> Jackie's the sacrificial lamb and you all know it
[3:21:13] <+DakotaChip> How long is this preview?
[3:21:14] <knomad2b> jackies super cool
[3:21:15] <Calek> I wasn't big on Jackie at first but he grew on me, he's a bro
[3:21:16] <Stari> crikGood
[3:21:16] <KillerCrocomire> Now the real question chat how unstable will th game be
[3:21:19] <+Thorn14> Level ?? means they will fucking murder you
[3:21:20] <C_Sixty_Jam> D:
[3:21:22] <%Keyd00d> welp
[3:21:23] <%Remery_> BONK

[3:26:02] <SailingSaturn> @AncelDeLambert the impotant part is that both are viable but have different rewards that doesn't invalidate ther other

[3:26:12] <+DakotaChip> Other then the cyberpunk future setting/aesthetic the gameplay seems pretty run of the mill. Nothing special or that I haven't seen in other games.
[3:26:15] <+SammyKiller> this game looks awesome, but it's nothing we have never seen before. Graphics are on par with many modern games.

[3:26:40] <yodajr99> They've threw away their humanity jojo
[3:26:41] <AncelDeLambert> @sailingsaturn the rewards need to specifically reward you FOR that route. Hacking buffs for hackers, guns for shooters, etc
[3:26:43] <knomad2b> you'd have to eal with those

[3:39:39] <+Quarkee> when i get this im totally going to be a fucking wall clinging horror creature with dual impaling blades
[3:39:39] <demonhunter790> Choices don’t matter
[3:39:40] <AncelDeLambert> I remember Mass Effect making these promises
[3:39:41] <Flyrant> game looks dope though
[3:39:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Wheres my Morality system
[3:39:44] <ReiDuran> They're REALLY trying to talk this up but man, I can't help but be really hesitant
[3:39:44] <thisisacoolguy> I read that as Jackie Chan...
[3:39:45] <MyNameIsRasus> This smells like Sean Murray
[3:39:46] <DeviNation13> "Work Together"
[3:39:47] <artoflec> i mean witcher and fucking fable are the only 2 series ive played where choices had long term impact
[3:39:47] <+Thorn14> Witcher has choices chat
[3:39:49] <ravencloak13> Depends. How was the Witchers stuff?
[3:39:50] <%Keansor> Every time they say your choices have consequences, and I haven't seen a single time where they actually do to the implied degree. You won't trick me, game!
[3:39:51] <C_Sixty_Jam> STEP ON ME COPRO LADY Kreygasm
[3:39:51] <+G_Thunders> There’s no way that many choices really “matter,” even if everything else is awesome
[3:39:51] <Xenioplate> BUT ESO 6 THO
[3:39:52] <%stigna1> I continue to be dubuis. This looks like a slightly more polished version of of most open-world RPGs with a bunch of buzzword-based promises.
