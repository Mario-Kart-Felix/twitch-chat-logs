[0:04:35] <$thesickestzak> Top is fed?
[0:04:35] <$hrbeck_> @dianatheascian you start with some and there’s a free rotation of like 4-5, and then they’re like $5 each
[0:04:35] <brisk_dacat> Who’s should be pats main? I think bulbasaur would be good.
[0:04:36] <+GobbleLynn> I think around 5 bucks? some are a little more expensive than others.
[0:04:45] <simifu> @furtive0ne Slowbro: I dont think so...
[0:04:49] <DianaTheAscian> k
[0:04:55] <%marvl102> Teach children about bone parasites to give them nightmares
[0:04:56] <$thesickestzak> Mr Mime all the way
[0:05:01] <+GobbleLynn> pat should probably play Machamp and suplex people

[0:05:23] <%GobbleLynn> oh shit I'm subbed to Pat again ty
[0:05:30] <$renyrells> guys pat is obviously going jungle so he can kill the most pokemans
[0:05:36] <Profmcstevie> This can only go well
[0:05:42] <%hrbeck_> Yeah, if Pat liked Mordekaiser, Machamp is a good pick
[0:05:48] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt Sorry for last night, I fucked up the tone of my first message and reflexively doubled down when you took it worse than I meant. Sorry again.
[0:05:51] <Moondoggie25> Charazard also has a pretty good piledriver
[0:05:51] <%KishinGrek> @marvl102 I shouldn't have googled that
[0:05:55] <DaKnightWarrior> I can finally watch Pat live properly! It's always nice when he streams this early.
[0:05:56] <Sotetsu> So this is switch only, huh? :(
[0:05:57] <%marvl102> If pat was a pokemon he'd be Granbull
[0:06:07] <%GobbleLynn> and you can totally jungle Machamp too if that's his style
[0:06:08] <kingluckyday100> Am loving this game a lot. Garchomp favorite if team doesn't Ko steal
[0:06:08] <+sandwich_jones> hit the dippy whens this start?
[0:06:11] <GamerWorlock> Bet he'll pick Venasaur the worst mon
[0:06:15] <mustachegolem> the real question is, will pat pay?
[0:06:15] <DianaTheAscian> It will only go well if Pat uses the money
[0:06:23] <%KishinGrek> Wartortle
[0:06:27] <DianaTheAscian> prob
[0:06:32] <%hrbeck_> @sotetsu mobile in Septey
[0:06:36] <DianaTheAscian> just to show off how bad it is
[0:06:38] <+projectmanatees> How bad are we gona dunk on the kids?
[0:06:39] <simifu> @Sotetsu for a moba it plays really well on a controller shockingly
[0:06:40] <+SilverDevilfish> Everyone ready for some pay to win garbage?
[0:06:40] <%marvl102> @KishinGrek The fact that there is a bone parasite that only affects human children is why there is no god, or if there is he doesn't deserve worship
[0:06:44] <mustachegolem> Wartortle is sick
[0:06:45] <Moondoggie25> The real strat is the dump all the new player currency into gengar, and destroy
[0:06:53] <%GobbleLynn> yeah Pat would probably go Blastoise if they were out
[0:07:21] <%hrbeck_> Gardevoir~
[0:07:29] <~PatStaresAt> THIS IS THE INTRO NOW ALL OF YOU SHUT UP THE STREAM ISNT OVER okay thanks for coming :3
[0:07:34] <%andrewofbob> @simifu It plays well, except it's a pain to pick your attack target
[0:07:34] <mustachegolem> hair pat
[0:07:37] <+furtive0ne> FWIW the game kinda dumps half the roster on day 1-3 if you play the bare minimum, leveling up items... THERES THE SCAM
[0:07:40] <%KishinGrek> SHUT UP MOM, MY ANIME IS STARTING

[0:24:50] <ExpressNode> Meanwhile lets play some gatcha
[0:24:50] <+Weeewer> The truth of the matter is, Unite is actually super fun so it sucks putting up with some of the bs around the gameplay
[0:24:52] <DianaTheAscian> I'm so sad that exist
[0:24:53] <gustavozxd> Nier gatcha is interesting apart from all the gatcha

[0:29:18] <%brickwall35> fuck them kids
[0:29:18] <%AkronymCLT> sometimes you meet someone so scummy it feels genuinely unreal
[0:29:22] <%TheYellowcouch> What if we give money
[0:29:24] <mustachegolem> evil is a driving force apparently
[0:29:27] <gustavozxd> i was about to say that
[0:29:30] <simifu> why are people still saying children?
[0:29:32] <bob900000> but kids are big now
[0:29:32] <+Weeewer> Pat would just get matched up with people who actually know how to play AND have items so it wont be that simple
[0:29:34] <gustavozxd> kids suck it's not hard to beat them
[0:29:35] <Profmcstevie> I know where the SCHOOL IS
[0:29:37] <mustachegolem> what about rich kids?
[0:29:38] <DaKnightWarrior> You get ONE Pat.
[0:29:43] <Fenrisulfr_V> The curb stomp symphony rides again.
[0:29:44] <Moondoggie25> About $20 will get you there
[0:29:48] <hearingthenseeing> Good quote
[0:29:55] <%TheYellowcouch> It was the fucking best first day
[0:29:58] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, do I have full permission to destroy childs?
[0:30:03] <%TheYellowcouch> Just all kids
[0:30:04] <gustavozxd> and them CONTINUE TO GET THEIR ASS KICKED
[0:30:06] <%TheYellowcouch> no money adults
[0:30:07] <%JamesCorck> Is this game a Ponsy Scheme?
[0:30:07] <Profmcstevie> Maybe you'll win if you skip the grind and pay little timmy
[0:30:09] <%Frost_Quill> I hate that you're probably right.
[0:30:10] <DianaTheAscian> Its to have kids get stomped so the kids will spend money
[0:30:12] <SilverFaustX> pats beats up kids
[0:30:12] <terrible35> you cracked tha case pat
[0:30:12] <hearingthenseeing> The system just works.
[0:30:13] <%AncelDeLambert> power-ups that probably don't matter, now that I've seen gameplay
[0:30:14] <Minorou> I already know one guy who's spent a couple hundred dollars to stomp kids
[0:30:15] <%Bailey__gaming> seems legit
[0:30:16] <DianaTheAscian> Yes.
[0:30:21] <yourliteraldog> Perfect balanced as all things should
[0:30:21] <Baljhet> The Hard Drive is typing as we speak
[0:30:23] <Frostydough1> oh it definitely it is just like moist critical murdering a family that were playing
[0:30:24] <%Radeson> this game is ridiculously easy compared to league too
[0:30:26] <+Positive_Feedback_Loop> it takes more than 20 beacuse each level requires like exponetionally more money
[0:30:28] <+MoonObscure> yes
[0:30:31] <%AncelDeLambert> this game uses a controller, how much help is a 3% speed bonus?
[0:30:31] <%viewtifulr> what is this the arcade era?
[0:30:35] <%Dakuu75> yep. the sooner you accept that, the less stressed you'll be
[0:30:38] <Explodincatz> to learn humility
[0:30:39] <mustachegolem> lmao I learned that so late
[0:30:39] <simifu> so what about you and your brother?
[0:30:41] <%brickwall35> never let your children win. they must earn victory
[0:30:44] <hearingthenseeing> He's right and you should say it
[0:30:45] <$thesickestzak> I can’t believe popular twitch streamer MADE this game pay to win. Charlie did it all himself lol
[0:30:46] <Profmcstevie> You must acknowledge your station to improve it, sometimes that's getting your shit kicked
[0:30:47] <Fenrisulfr_V> Never forget, there's always someone that's both YOUNGER and BETTER than you,
[0:30:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> rude
[0:30:50] <%Radeson> most games I play we end up pushing the enemy team into their base and trapping them
[0:30:52] <OldManDeckardCain> a lot of uni kids could really use that lesson
[0:30:54] <%TheYellowcouch> Definitely bigger
[0:30:56] <+sandwich_jones> WHEN I was a YOUNG WORTHOG!!!
[0:30:58] <GamerWorlock> That article on Charlie is so absurd
[0:31:00] <%SvenHolgersson> Thanks momma Boivin!
[0:31:01] <%brickwall35> "you're short, ugly, and stupid"
[0:31:01] <%Dakuu75> (This explains so much.)

[0:31:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's a horrible thing to say to your child
[0:31:13] <Moondoggie25> @positive_feedback_loop all you need is gengar and enough to level his held items
[0:31:14] <tanarath> huh?
[0:31:14] <T_Sasquatch> Thanks mom ?

[0:31:20] <Fenrisulfr_V> I legit never learned that lesson until College, and it shattered my worldview.
[0:31:20] <%TheYellowcouch> Yeah they made it sound like he ruined pokemon unite
[0:31:21] <hearingthenseeing> I can't just let my cousin always win at smash, he must be stomped
[0:31:22] <Explodincatz> please link
[0:31:26] <DianaTheAscian> who?
[0:31:26] <%AncelDeLambert> what's he supposed to do, NOT win???
