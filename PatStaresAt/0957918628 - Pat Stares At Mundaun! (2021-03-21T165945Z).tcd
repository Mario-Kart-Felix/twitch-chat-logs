[0:29:21] <Coystick> ew unlocked fps
[0:29:22] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> 120 is a good sweet spot. Anything over that would be better spent towards fidelity imo
[0:29:25] <%barrakuta371> Max thought the same thing until he started playing Doom Eternal at 120 fps
[0:29:28] <%LilyaFatal> Da smooth

[0:29:36] <dukenux> Were you high, Pat?
[0:29:41] <derap41> Free Sync is magic
[0:29:42] <%TheBensonator_> 120/144Hz is a fucking game changer
[0:29:43] <Vlad_Tech> I remember when I was first told that 4k monitors don't matter... then I got one anyways and it was glorious!.... except the frame rate PepeHands

[0:43:58] <a_karmachameleon> I thought NFT was about art.
[0:43:59] <$KnivesEve> wtf is a NFT?
[0:44:00] <+corrosivePaladin> thats my favorite bit. theyre just urls
[0:44:01] <worldbrand> some NFTs are worth more than the domain their art is hosted on
[0:44:07] <Party_de_Dos> oh man, that sounds like a viable alternative to money
[0:44:08] <%MelBrooksKA> totally not a scam
[0:44:08] <a_karmachameleon> man was I wrong.
[0:44:12] <%arcielardor> It's essentially the Russian economy
[0:44:13] <$RealThiele> NFT is a triangle plan

[0:44:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> @a_karmachameleon It's about digital art and totally not a money laundering scheme

[1:21:47] <+PatchTheGamer> hay
[1:21:54] <+JustToWatch> wait can you make coffee
[1:22:00] <AncyentMarinere> Go make coffee TooSpicy
[1:22:00] <slimeman420> @PatStaresAt Where's the Bovin cut of Justice League?!
[1:22:03] <+Pendragwn> It would have been nuts if they figured out how make the entire landscape look like a scribble
[1:22:19] <dukenux> id guess theres something inside
[1:22:21] <%AncelDeLambert> DRINK COFFEE
[1:22:27] <@SSaryn> I mean, why not
[1:22:27] <sendart> fire good
[1:22:28] <%Jaxnos> i just got here and this game is giving me strong Pathologic vibes and I'm not sure if it should.
[1:22:28] <+Pendragwn> this is known
[1:22:30] <BliVru> why not
[1:22:31] <+trackles_64> fire burns the spirits
[1:22:32] <%AncelDeLambert> because it's SATAN, Pat!
[1:22:32] <John_Tsuda> Coffee probably tied to sanity?
[1:22:34] <+Pendragwn> burn it coward
[1:22:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Burning haystacks probably wards off monsters in the night
[1:22:36] <spongeofmystery> Ah yes, this has to be a Swiss dialect
[1:22:36] <Casavilla458> sometimes in life you got to burn it all
[1:22:36] <+storebrandcandy> fire is always an option
[1:22:37] <%king_wragles> Sometimes you gotta burn it all down, Pat
[1:22:38] <$RealThiele> its always an option to burn it all down
[1:22:42] <dukenux> Your protag is a pyromaniac
[1:22:43] <glgzephyr> gonna guess that this guy likes lighting things on fire and he was the arsonist the whole time
[1:22:47] <goatcommander717> it always ends in fire
[1:22:49] <thatotherguynikolas> For Satan, of course
[1:22:49] <%Chichen> because it must be cleansed
[1:22:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't like how this is turning into survival horror
[1:23:01] <dukenux> Some men just wants to watch the world burn
[1:23:13] <skyentombment> Is this not the best time to ask Peaches for a caffee , Pat?
[1:23:29] <+storebrandcandy> quick, burn the water
[1:23:31] <dukenux> fill pan with water
[1:23:35] <Borkbiff > Get ye flask

[1:23:37] <John_Tsuda> burn the water?
[1:23:37] <dukenux> make a soup
[1:23:39] <+trackles_64> sounds like peeing
[1:23:41] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, you know what? Your hand has "burnt shit" powers, that's probably why
[1:23:48] <DraxTD> Hay pat, what's this thing?
[1:23:52] <AncyentMarinere> KomodoHype KomodoHype
[1:24:00] <FullMetalSnorlax> instead you should be confused when burning isnt an option
[1:24:01] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe
[1:24:01] <+BloodyBurney> i feel like something could go horribly wrong at any time
[1:24:02] <+BlackSunEmperor> mmm hot bean water

[1:24:37] <%AncelDeLambert> I hope that's Turkish coffee
[1:24:39] <+trackles_64> seems very convuleted
[1:24:39] <%WhereIsWill> coffee got BRRRRR
[1:24:41] <%ConLin_Arts_> Coffee is probably to restore sanity?

[1:36:10] <%Alazull> That sounded like a bunch of bork
[1:36:13] <+PatchTheGamer> This is one of the few times I started and beat a game in one sitting, and coincidentally the night before Pat played it.
[1:36:19] <%MelBrooksKA> *Spokey Yodeling Intensifies*

[1:36:59] <derap41> this game is just a spooky farming simulator
[1:37:05] <%AncelDeLambert> "warp speed: engage! I'm late for work. NYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"
[1:37:06] <SaltyAzteca> his left hand is all gnarly
[1:37:11] <%MassConnect> oh no, the "weapon" is sut for hay

[1:38:27] <+chiazam> What's that key for
[1:38:28] <CocoonMoon> @PatStaresAt Streamer mode turns off the radio, kinda weird since it's all Romansh stuff
[1:38:38] <CocoonMoon> @PatStaresAt Unless it's bugged or something
[1:38:42] <thatotherguynikolas> Jesus room maybe?
[1:38:52] <+JustToWatch> I wonder if there is a dev in chat this time
[1:38:54] <+trackles_64> i hate DMCA its so bs
[1:38:56] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Is the Radio important?
[1:39:01] <Kokobang> the graveyard maybe
[1:39:06] <%yet_another_brony> tell paige i said hi!
[1:39:06] <dukenux> thanks again DMCA
[1:39:07] <%CalderGaming> hi paige o/
[1:39:08] <BliVru> Maybe the cementary?
[1:39:08] <%bhp_99> is it not the ignition key?
[1:39:17] <%CalderGaming> "how is your urethra, honey"
[1:39:17] <+chiazam> IS THERE SOMEONE IN THAT ROOM
[1:39:20] <%WhereIsWill> playing midsommar LUL
[1:39:21] <Buka_Zero> is this one of those spook 'em ups?
[1:39:24] <CocoonMoon> @LeRouch_the_Rebel I don't think so, but it's a nice touch
[1:39:26] <dukenux> barely a town
[1:39:29] <%Dunmarkh> Yeah his dance barn burned down
[1:39:38] <%WhereIsWill> its a permabuff too!
[1:39:40] <dukenux> one house and a chapel
[1:39:41] <revoltingimp> stay classy
[1:39:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This game could use some conveyor belts
[1:39:44] <FullMetalSnorlax> wait so the key ISNT for the muvel in the same room?
[1:39:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> coffee does that?
[1:39:51] <%JoshManVGH> Permanently, even.
[1:39:59] <%MassConnect> did Pat say beer resistance or fear resistance or both
[1:40:06] <BliVru> the cementary?
[1:40:08] <glgzephyr> both
[1:40:09] <Buka_Zero> is it true tho
[1:40:12] <+trackles_64> this map is huge
[1:40:14] <%JoshManVGH> Fear
[1:40:17] <JAGwab> pat is going crazy, hes talking to invisible lady in his house
[1:40:18] <jowi_time> maybe the chapel?
[1:40:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> THE CHAPEL
[1:40:30] <Borkbiff > If you think about, bears are to be feared, so it's surely both
[1:40:32] <%Cn_alpha_02> Graveyard?
[1:40:39] <%JoshManVGH> go to priest
[1:40:40] <dukenux> im CIA
[1:40:43] <glgzephyr> paige is the bartender from The Shining
[1:40:44] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> So, the game says it's got a cool pen drawn style, but all I can see is a kind of gray-scale filter and nowt else
[1:41:08] <Buka_Zero> same
[1:41:13] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Pat CYC means Command & Conquer
[1:41:41] <glgzephyr> fuck off!
[1:41:44] <+TheBitingIrish> @OverzealousEuthanasiast The textures are all pencil drawn
[1:41:45] <%Ranryu692> that keyhole is cross-shaped
[1:41:48] <jowi_time> chapel?
[1:41:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> try chapellle
[1:41:55] <+chiazam> The Chapel?
[1:42:05] <JAGwab> can you inspect the items?
[1:42:07] <Buka_Zero> time to give up forever
[1:42:26] <glgzephyr> he's listening to the game, leave him alone
[1:42:28] <+PolychromePanda> the presit has a radio set to something
[1:42:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It just seems like a gray filter on top of a retraux-style 3D graphics, but it still looks pretty good though
[1:42:34] <khalcatto> look up
[1:42:38] <%Cn_alpha_02> Cell in the barn.
[1:42:42] <jowi_time> probably in your grandpa's room
[1:42:43] <mai_cu> look up
[1:42:44] <%bhp_99> i'm sure that'll up your stats like the coffee
[1:42:46] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Huh, deceptive imagery!

[2:13:29] <dukenux> okay, its Lucifer
[2:13:30] <glgzephyr> He looooooves the sadness juice
[2:13:34] <dukenux> yes
[2:13:37] <glgzephyr> @TheotherKristian yes
[2:13:39] <$RealThiele> pretty cool right?
[2:14:03] <%Dunmarkh> the drunk guy
[2:14:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Jeremias sounds like Pat's 'making fun of the whiners' voice
[2:14:13] <%RyderTiliqua> BUNGER?
[2:14:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @TheotherKristian Romansh, I believe. Real obscure language that's only really spoken in Switzerland
[2:14:30] <%Dunmarkh> bunker seems like the right place to be right now
[2:14:32] <glgzephyr> that goatfucker!
[2:14:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> @TheotherKristian Yeah, it's german.... Mundaun is a real place in Switzerland
[2:14:46] <+GenesisKnight> THAT KEY LOOKS SO EVIL
[2:14:58] <glgzephyr> the hail has conveniently stopped

[2:15:10] <Grunkle_Dan_> osmething tells me grandpa might have been into some nefarious shit#

[2:15:23] <%CalderGaming> @TheotherKristian it's Romansh
[2:15:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nefarious shit other than selling his soul to the devil?

[2:15:47] <glgzephyr> by the way Switzerland is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and you should all go there before you die
[2:15:56] <%WhereIsWill> i think you brought a cup instead of the pot to the wter thing
[2:15:56] <redapache> hey Pat what is this game?
[2:16:05] <%SwdVengeance> Hey man, it’s a day man.
[2:16:06] <iswearimjustdandy> Well romansh sounds really pretty, what a nice language
[2:16:13] <+ArtsyFoxo> Ohh so this is Swiss
[2:16:15] <+ArtsyFoxo> like the cheese
[2:16:21] <dukenux> Romansch is spoken in like a one canton in Switzerland i think
[2:16:23] <KaiserMario> Pencilvania
[2:16:28] <Grunkle_Dan_> i know a swiss guy, this explains a lot
[2:16:42] <Goergorion> hundreds of pencils died to bring us this game
[2:16:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Day man? Fighter of the Night man? Champion of the sun? He's a master of karate, and friendship for everyone?
[2:16:53] <dinnydanny777> So it's like one of those old PC Adventure games
[2:16:57] <+BloodyBurney> i know we've been saying this a lot, but this game is super cool.
[2:16:57] <echobee_tv> OLED Gang!
[2:16:58] <$RealThiele> "ohhh"
[2:17:06] <%BoxNavy> theres too many
[2:17:07] <%Ziegsy> I have a covid baccine headache. please never shake the screen like that again
[2:17:08] <nicversus> this seriously looks like it came out in 2003
[2:17:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> do the swiss like cheese, chocolate, and devil?
[2:17:25] <nicversus> I can only assume the devs loved doing source mods
[2:17:27] <Ipsenscastle> is the pattern on the goat head a crab???
[2:17:31] <%Dementedpenguin> Sure.
[2:17:34] <+JustToWatch> also watches
[2:17:36] <+Pendragwn> yes
[2:17:38] <%Dunmarkh> @TurtlesAndTentacles don't we all?
[2:17:40] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:17:40] <spongeofmystery> You forgot hiding Nazi gold
[2:17:41] <iswearimjustdandy> @dukenux im looking at a map and it looks like its more widely spoken than german, at least by area if not population
[2:17:42] <+Matantara> you found a new radio frequqncy earlier
[2:17:43] <saraizarai> Sounds like the swiss to me
[2:17:43] <$RealThiele> also nazi gold
[2:17:44] <khalcatto> the cheese is the devil
[2:17:45] <dinnydanny777> And knives
[2:17:46] <Grunkle_Dan_> they also love gold, no matter the origin Kappa
[2:17:48] <%WhereIsWill> that explains why their metal is soo good
[2:17:49] <nicversus> and army knives
[2:17:49] <%Ziegsy> And toblerones up the ass, apparently
[2:17:51] <dukenux> watches and army knives
[2:17:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> LMAO okay Pat that got me .
[2:17:54] <%Piemen99> can't forget about knifes
[2:18:01] <%Ranryu692> they also like multipurpose tools
[2:18:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just like the 4 languages of Switzerland, the Swiss have 4 traits
[2:18:32] <+GenesisKnight> Did you check the study?
[2:18:34] <%crimsonharvest> Is that why so many of the words sound like a half-hear spanish? They got a lot of italian words?
[2:18:49] <marrowjuice> these fucking textures are making me bust a nut, but theoretically cause i physically have no nuts to bust
[2:18:51] <%armandog143> Cross key
[2:18:58] <+BloodyBurney> did he open the study or am i dumb
[2:19:03] <Grunkle_Dan_> hey man, coffee is good
[2:19:07] <JAGwab> the accent sounds italian too
[2:19:10] <%sniffy77> Understandable
[2:19:20] <spongeofmystery> @crimsonharvest yeah, I'm getting it with words like "porta" for door
[2:19:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Im more of a tea person
[2:19:23] <dukenux> @crimsonharvest i think its cause romansch belongs to the romance languanges
[2:19:26] <Borkbiff > @marrowjuice Might well be their Latin origin, Romansh is quite pure as far as they go
[2:19:32] <dukenux> like italian or french
[2:19:39] <+tussletoes> hell yeah this game rules it's so evil
[2:19:40] <%Ziegsy> @marrowjuice your owner was responsible to get you neutered
[2:20:00] <ItIsSky> Romansh is a latin language so that is probably why
[2:20:02] <Grunkle_Dan_> that map is badass
[2:20:03] <FairOnFire> both Italian and french are spoken in the country as well, so
[2:20:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> jump
[2:20:05] <%crimsonharvest> thats cool cause a few of these phrases come across totally intelligible, but mostly i can't get it
[2:20:07] <John_Tsuda> A haymonster
[2:20:14] <%Piemono> Do the burnable hay piles turn into haymen at night?
[2:20:16] <KaiserMario> Hey Pat, out of curiosity, would you ever make a deal with the devil? If so, in exchange for what, immortality?
[2:20:19] <+Pendragwn> @marrowjuice can ovaries nut
[2:20:27] <dukenux> Hayfren
[2:20:34] <%Nekros4442> Wait what
[2:20:40] <%Nekros4442> How is that candle working like a flashlight
[2:20:41] <Grunkle_Dan_> he'd make a deal for more Virtua Fighter
[2:20:42] <JAGwab> this game is what's reading a black metal lyrics feels like
[2:20:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Immortality would be a terrible thing to experience
[2:20:46] <dinnydanny777> this is horrifying
[2:20:47] <$Ziegsy> @pendragwn as someone with ovarian cysts - yes. But it hurts
[2:20:51] <%CalderGaming> what is this candle
[2:21:00] <dukenux> D;
[2:21:00] <glgzephyr> don't your candles function like projectors?
[2:21:01] <+GenesisKnight> Satan a jerk
[2:21:03] <SpaceManHotepIV> curly fingies
[2:21:03] <%BoxNavy> NOOOO
[2:21:05] <%WhereIsWill> what a douche
[2:21:06] <penitentpendant> That's a shocking number of cylindrical stones he found
[2:21:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Mephistopheles is a real jerk
[2:21:07] <Borkbiff > Jerk...
[2:21:11] <khalcatto> what a bitch
[2:21:14] <%Ziegsy> were those fingers bending nackwards?
[2:21:18] <%JoshManVGH> The devil is most evil, he knocked over your blocks
[2:21:22] <marrowjuice> that was so mean
[2:21:22] <+Pendragwn> this is a powerful stand ability
[2:21:23] <+GenesisKnight> Bitch ass satan
[2:21:25] <%Arancet> what a jerk my evil hand is
[2:21:35] <A0N33> Wait but I'm left-handed
[2:21:35] <%CalderGaming> @Ziegsy yup, devil hand
[2:21:40] <CatRidder> so he is like nero
[2:21:42] <dinnydanny777> How sinistre
[2:21:42] <%Movemeister> the sinister hand
[2:21:43] <%Ziegsy> I thought it was the red right hand
[2:21:44] <Srthunda> yes
[2:21:45] <%bhp_99> yeah
[2:21:45] <A0N33> Yes
[2:21:45] <penitentpendant> Fog rollin' in
[2:21:46] <@SSaryn> It's fiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[2:21:46] <%Piemono> You should jerkoff with the evil hand
[2:21:46] <dukenux> the jerk off hand
[2:21:48] <Ipsenscastle> satan's definitely in my right hand though
[2:21:48] <Grunkle_Dan_> i thought he liked the right because of the jerking off 🤔
[2:21:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fiiiiiine
[2:21:51] <penitentpendant> Next up: Silent Hill sirens
[2:21:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah its pretty thick
[2:21:54] <%BoxNavy> all left handed people are dowwn with the devil
[2:21:54] <%Dunmarkh> definitly
[2:21:56] <thatotherguynikolas> boy does it
[2:21:58] <khalcatto> so left handed people are the devil then
[2:22:02] <+GenesisKnight> For sure
[2:22:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> some people use their left @Grunkle_Dan_
[2:22:09] <Borkbiff > The fart gas is increasing in volume
[2:22:10] <%vehementvadr> in fog nito
[2:22:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The left hand is the most sinister one after all B)
[2:22:29] <%Nekros4442> The word sinister is literally just derived from a word that just meant left
[2:22:30] <%Dunmarkh> the dungeon/wine cellar
[2:22:30] <revoltingimp> no, we are just more likely to be chosen by the devil

[2:55:15] <%MelBrooksKA> @dukenux Are you really asking why the headless magical goat is glowing...
[2:55:28] <Ipsenscastle> Alraun is a mandrake monster
[2:55:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Even a goat with no nose can smell your stench
[2:55:35] <+thekaijuworkshop> bees and bridges
[2:55:36] <+GenesisKnight> Not the bees! NOT THE BEES!
[2:55:41] <+MegaCorpltd> Well it's your fault for following a goat.
[2:55:45] <Ipsenscastle> It's supposed to grow from the semen of hanged men
[2:55:46] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt How are you liking it dude? Looks SUPER weird and interesting
[2:55:49] <dukenux> @melbrookska it mightve been just a goat zombie

[2:58:48] <marrowjuice> what an uggo
[2:58:48] <ChungusQuest> holy shit, she was born mad-dogging the whole world
[2:58:48] <+thekaijuworkshop> imagine eating soup out of your goat head thermos
[2:58:50] <John_Tsuda> Why do these mountain people gotta be so cryptic?
[2:59:00] <%aishman> Man I think the fact there's hardly any music makes this all the more like, suspenseful
[2:59:01] <dukenux> just a baby drinking coffee
[2:59:01] <Pappajimbo> must be a spencer(TM) house
[2:59:04] <%Dunmarkh> make some cafe'
[2:59:07] <egressanon> it makes sense for the head to move if the body is walking around honestly
[2:59:27] <+GenesisKnight> bitch ass Satan
[2:59:36] <dukenux> hes just standing there
[2:59:40] <%solracc25> get water for cofee
[2:59:41] <dukenux> MENACINGLY
[2:59:41] <%aishman> So every time you save does the time go forward or something?
[2:59:48] <+Breaknoon> kaofee
[2:59:59] <Ipsenscastle> mix a margarita in its mouth
[3:00:01] <%Dunmarkh> @aishman nah
[3:00:06] <Ipsenscastle> spring break
[3:00:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The lack of music just makes it eerie. There are radios, mind you, but they're disabled in Streamer mode I think
[3:00:15] <%X2Eliah> Ah yeah fill up that chamberpot with coffee water
[3:00:20] <dukenux> can you prep the coffee in the goat
[3:00:21] <+thekaijuworkshop> fire
[3:00:21] <marrowjuice> this game doesn't exactly scare me, but it does fill me with dread
[3:00:29] <Borkbiff > FK... in the CAFE
[3:00:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> did that goat's eyes just blink?
[3:00:42] <%vehementvadr> the goat head blinked I swear
[3:00:44] <thatotherguynikolas> ah yes. A cup of coffee before going to bed...
[3:00:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> in the inventory
[3:00:56] <John_Tsuda> The goat head is in fact alive
[3:00:57] <dukenux> the goat head is alive guys
[3:01:01] <DragonBornKing> @vehementvadr it def did
[3:01:17] <%X2Eliah> Wait actually what location is this meant ot take place? the written names of books/matches etc. seem like a jumble of germanic/nordic european names, spoken language sounds italian-adjacent
[3:01:29] <%Dunmarkh> you're a brave boy now
[3:01:34] <Borkbiff > Switzerland
[3:01:35] <+Cuon_Alpinus> somewhere in the alps
[3:01:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> @X2Eliah it's all Swiss
[3:01:41] <dukenux> @x2eliah Switzerland

[3:01:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @X2Eliah Switzerland, so yes it is exactly that
[3:02:00] <KaiserMario> Best coffee drinking in a game is still from Evil Within 2 in my opinion, "Ah... takes off the edge..."
[3:02:04] <pi_in_the_sci> was there something on the floor behind the table on the third floor?
[3:02:14] <%Marg0Pol0> I feel coffee should horseshoe fear resistance
[3:02:29] <%Dunmarkh> but where go now?

[3:21:50] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> So is that the wrong approach or is Pat just not good enough at smoking?
[3:21:56] <elicoy> now we just need cubes as an enemy
[3:21:58] <marrowjuice> i've always wondered what honeycomb tastes like
[3:21:58] <DraxTD> krunkB krunkB krunkB
[3:22:01] <Hoot_Patoots> gun the bees
[3:22:06] <DragonBornKing> pipe>gun

[3:22:09] <%Dunmarkh> idk maybe
[3:22:09] <penitentpendant> In a horror setting? No.
[3:22:10] <%Ranryu692> guns wont help you against bees
[3:22:11] <%X2Eliah> NEED GUN SHOOT BEES
[3:22:11] <huskarl_zap> The bee noise is just someone reading the bee movie script but its fucked up in post production
[3:22:16] <penitentpendant> Not unless the gun has exactly one bullet
[3:22:16] <KasiCrafter> Yes Pat GUN the bees
[3:22:17] <%BoxNavy> chat if you got turned into a beehive what would you do
[3:22:21] <+Epic_Fubar> knife the bees
[3:22:22] <%patriotrenegade> boolets
[3:22:24] <%SirGO0SE> no gun only boolet
[3:22:24] <DraxTD> have we done a not the bees joke yet?
[3:22:27] <Phrickshun> As an american I say shoot the bees
[3:22:28] <%MistyMntns> Bee Suit!
[3:22:29] <%Dunmarkh> @penitentpendant he has nine bullets and a rifle skill
[3:22:30] <John_Tsuda> I think you get a gun at Walt's place.

[3:23:06] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Is it still hip to fuck bees? psaLiz
[3:23:11] <penitentpendant> @Dunmarkh As long as it's very finite, the more boolet you have the less scary it gets. Then you venture into 'survival horror'
[3:23:14] <huskarl_zap> Doom suit rules

[3:23:17] <%BoxNavy> they ATE it
