[0:27:36] <penitentpendant> @Frost_Quill It does not help with the queue. It does help with the load in. And on some computers prevents crashing if there were too many people there.

[0:28:10] <%JoshManVGH> I remember trying to sign into WotLK, and even if you could the servers CHUGGED in gameplay
[0:28:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Monkeyweed21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Got a new job and despite having a lower hourly pay AND having to pay union dues, my paychecks are way bigger. I wonder what phenomenon could possibly explain this
[0:28:24] <%BoxNavy> again :)
[0:28:25] <%Frost_Quill> Totally.
[0:28:25] <@TheYellowcouch> I SURE HOPE IT WILL BE
[0:28:27] <skullneedles> yeah
[0:28:27] <+Greywyn00> agreed
[0:28:27] <$ringabal> God I hope
[0:28:30] <iosephe> Again
[0:28:31] <%kainhighwind1990> Do you think Zenos will be the final boss?
[0:28:33] <inksmears> again!?
[0:28:33] <Baljhet> nah
[0:28:34] <T_Sasquatch> Mhmmm
[0:28:34] <+SolGainer> yeah I  agree
[0:28:34] <+cappyd33> well yeah
[0:28:34] <engineboi> It should be.
[0:28:35] <%W1nterTitan> That's fair.
[0:28:36] <%Nobrev> I fuckin hope it's a solo duty
[0:28:36] <+Dragocrafterr> god please
[0:28:37] <%InternetShis> I hope
[0:28:37] <Cosairen> fighting zenos is always that except for ala mihgo so that checks
[0:28:37] <%debugdrawray_> zenos is solo, zodiark will be a trial
[0:28:39] <%RealThiele> he will transform into a raid
[0:28:40] <%azacca_bitter> solo duty into instance
[0:28:41] <@TheYellowcouch> I want that stormblood final boss I always wanted
[0:28:42] <$ringabal> HE DESERVES THAT MUCH
[0:28:42] <%SlackerAlex> It'll have a savage version tho. like the bozja thing
[0:28:42] <+OmegaFatalis> Sam bros represent
[0:28:42] <%stoatacious> nah he's gonna do some zodiark shit
[0:28:42] <+tetraes> I bet we fight Zenos solo then he has transformation and thats the trial @PatStaresAt
[0:28:43] <snow_soldier> I think it'll be both
[0:28:43] <dan_g_v> wha? Yandere boy who wants to fight you wants a solo fight? Who would have thunk!
[0:28:44] <%lucky_icarus> fuck yeah!
[0:28:46] <Ginganinja4545> car is normal
[0:28:47] <inksmears> then whomst
[0:28:47] <+doctor_brofessor> Gonna guess it's gonna start as an 8 man going into a solo mission
[0:28:47] <%BoxNavy> we know for a fact fandaniel isnt
[0:28:47] <+Ram23wolf> He gonna fuse with Zodiark
[0:28:48] <+Buttlo> Good I want more alone time with Daddy Dumptruck
[0:28:48] <+TuskDeluxe> Dream: It will be an 8 man against A REGULAR HUMAN Zenos
[0:28:48] <@SpaceCapnCrone> The Boss in 5.3 sure as fuck reacts to your LB3 creepy49Uhhh
[0:28:48] <+FinetiSonata> Zenos could transform into an 8-man, but that would be stormblood 2
[0:28:49] <+DormaKazzy> Mommy crystal final boss?
[0:28:49] <+cappyd33> its LITERALLY GOING TO BE AZEM
[0:28:49] <Tracazoid> It wouldn't be any other way for Zenos for all characters

[0:28:52] <penitentpendant> Hydalen: "ALL ACCORDING TO KEIKAKKU!"
[0:28:53] <%Frost_Quill> Zenos+Hydaelyn/Zodiark will be an 8-man.

[0:31:55] <skullneedles> if you aren't caught up you probably shouldn't be here for your own sake
[0:31:58] <Loxoron> You can now officially say that the game has done damage to our world
[0:31:59] <thatdudenamedlogan> We must use the souls of the past to defend the future

[0:32:19] <SaltyAzteca> only the Koopy sandwich can save us now
[0:32:20] <TeepPhoenix> Most of the patch trailers were kind of vague
[0:32:22] <@JustinianKnight> heyo
[0:32:23] <%Frost_Quill> @RealThiele Oh yeah we actually did.
[0:32:24] <%atteroproxy> OMNICRAFTER
[0:32:24] <%FingaLights> @healnavi are you thinking of that one person also
[0:32:27] <%walternatorz> do MSQ first and get to 90
[0:32:31] <MidnightPacif1c> the nomad soul was jfk this whole time
[0:32:31] <penitentpendant> MSQ stops you from being vulnerable to spoilers
[0:32:33] <@TheYellowcouch> I respect the hustle tho
[0:32:33] <Cosairen> YOU WILL GET SPOILED
[0:32:34] <chris_babaganoosh05> Man I can't believe Zenos split G'raha in half and stuck Zodiark up his butt
[0:32:34] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[0:32:35] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL
[0:32:38] <%Reilata> I've never seen anything about 14 except for some trailers, so watching into Endwalker is probably going to be strange.
[0:32:39] <%tusk102> msq is more important
[0:32:40] <+charm_quark_> fuck you I'm going ocean fishing
[0:32:41] <$StrawberryPantsu> True

[0:32:47] <P3r50n4> land of the handjobs?
[0:32:48] <LiulfrJ> honestly the game calling bosses titles other than there name is the best anti spoiler
[0:32:51] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Also they will get super spoiled
[0:32:51] <@TheYellowcouch> It'd be really funny to be the first lvl 90 fisher
[0:32:51] <+SolGainer> Moon fishing....
[0:32:52] <PhilanthropyG> borderline mandatory
[0:32:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt also spoilers from new craftable gear
[0:32:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> I'm Blitzing the MSQ

[0:37:49] <skullneedles> IT HURT
[0:37:49] <%LastHazzerd> it's WEIRD
[0:37:49] <%KineticZen> I hate it
[0:37:50] <%shurtal> sure it was belts and not gloves?
[0:37:51] <%Rumbutt> OH FUCK
[0:37:51] <PhilanthropyG> removing belts and desynthing felt like I was doing body mutilation
[0:37:51] <+Ghazarban> Ooof

[0:37:52] <kyuubisonic> yep
[0:37:53] <inksmears> IT DID
[0:37:54] <%CalderGaming> YES
[0:37:54] <Aeonknight_87> it was fucking weird
[0:37:55] <+Toshatron> ughhhhh
[0:37:55] <KnightessWulf> PENTAMELDED
[0:37:55] <FuzzyKey> FUCK! I FORGOT TO DO MY BELTS
[0:37:56] <%VioletHeart> Oh yeah it felt violently wrong.
[0:37:56] <count_bob> YES
[0:37:58] <+xythanshadow> Oh god I didn't do that
[0:37:58] <%BoxNavy> yeah it was bad
[0:37:58] <kyuubisonic> i was to scared ot do it
[0:37:59] <%GelatinBoi> Yeay
[0:38:00] <%W1nterTitan> BRAIN SAYS WRONG
[0:38:00] <%walternatorz> oh god, it felt horrible
[0:38:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> YEAH
[0:38:03] <Skelegon> RIP speed belt
[0:38:05] <ValkahRoctsteel> I’ve got 7 retainers and everything is full of glamour. I tried to sort them before EW
[0:38:05] <dan_g_v> yeyeye bad!
[0:38:05] <%Nobrev> just remving the materia from all my belts felt fucking awful
[0:38:06] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Mind goblin bad
[0:38:07] <shadowstreakXIII> yup
[0:38:07] <%AncelDeLambert> it'll be nice to have the main issue I have with the game gone, even if it is such a stupid roundabout way of doing it. Inventory bloat is an albatross on this game.
[0:38:08] <%WhereIsWill> Pat I didn't do ANY gear prep how screwed am i??
[0:38:08] <skullneedles> removing the materia from a pentameld felt like a crime
[0:38:08] <%TEANTACLES> OH SHIT FORGOT TO DO BELTS
[0:38:09] <LiulfrJ> I'm like 40 items from maxing my glamour chest and I can't believe they're still releasing event stuff that can't go in the armoire
[0:38:09] <%chiazam> FUCK
[0:38:09] <%Saadi90> It felt wrong
[0:38:11] <TeddyBrosefvelt> desynthing the aesthete gatherer and crafter one crushed me
[0:38:11] <%RealThiele> ILVL SAYS WRONG
[0:38:12] <17sevens> where's the guy who desynthed their gloves by accident
[0:38:13] <TeepPhoenix> I have to say I'm not going to miss belts.
[0:38:13] <+polothegreatest> goblin slayed?
[0:38:14] <faldin> Oh yeah for sure
[0:38:14] <%Frost_Quill> I sold all my belts and it wouldn't let me sell the crafting and gathering belts.
[0:38:14] <BreakfastSampler> felt great. like rearranging furniture
[0:38:14] <%goblincat__> i sold my belts so maybe i did bad
[0:38:16] <Amadeusguy> I started to feel anxious as I was desynthing my belts
[0:38:16] <%Eaglestrike117> hey, atleast it wasnt all your GLOVES
[0:38:17] <@JustinianKnight> Speed Belt became a ring
[0:38:17] <%walternatorz> every brain synapse fired bad feelings
[0:38:19] <dan_g_v> imagine uncrafting things you didn't want to uncraft
[0:38:21] <Skelegon> seeing my ilvl go down felt bad
[0:38:21] <+OmegaFatalis> yeah I forgot about the belts RIP
[0:38:23] <T_Sasquatch> I have an entire retainer inventory full of dungeon glam i don't want to grind for again
[0:38:23] <%Wool> @17sevens hi that's me
[0:38:30] <%JGardner03> That literally STOPPED me from desynthing my Savage belts
[0:38:34] <%MisterRockett> "lol jk we're keeping belts"
[0:38:37] <umbraawitch> @LiulfrJ i do not understand why the armoire has restrictions
[0:38:38] <%Valdorick> "PSYCH! We didn't delete belts! They're even stronger now infact!" - FF14 patch notes a 4 hours
[0:38:42] <cartakus> I don't get mmos
[0:38:42] <%JGardner03> er unequipping
[0:38:43] <%RealThiele> there was a cute 14 anime intro recently too
[0:38:43] <%Frost_Quill> If you have the speed belt keep it you can turn it into a ring.
[0:38:50] <Skelegon> haha nomura
[0:38:57] <%QuasarKnightGaming> I only had time to get 1 max GS item. 4 hours before the announcement for no more belts, I bought my maxed out Belt for WHM.

[0:49:57] <ExpressNode> I don't play MMOs and even I think that will burn you out
[0:49:59] <%Axellogic> Max only ever played some of Heavensward then tried to catch up to endwalker and ended up giving up as soon as he got to stormblood
[0:50:00] <marvel877> Pat, Halo is Doritos. That's why they made a game with the guy on the Doritos bag.
[0:50:00] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So strong!
[0:50:02] <stealthfart> Treats now
[0:50:07] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So handsome! I love Gief!
[0:50:08] <Daxalog> Your either there and you experience it as it happens. Or you start months late trying to avoid spoiler. There is no catch up.
[0:50:10] <Kaito_Cam> Shit did i miss the DRK nerf rant?
[0:50:12] <+BulletproofMoon> "MMO catchup" is a mental holdover from WoW where the story sucked and only endgame mattered
[0:50:13] <%brisk_dacat> Yeah right he did
[0:50:14] <Spiral93> you underestimate his power
[0:50:15] <+Spawnbroker> omnomnom

[0:50:39] <Kyosan90> So Pat I know Endwalker is here but which are you hyped for Endwalker or Elden Ring?
[0:50:43] <schiester420> i did 5.1 to 5.3 plus 5.4 up to matoya's relict in a single day because my sub was running out hbghfdhfjhgjghkghhfdhd
[0:50:49] <penitentpendant> "Can the moon stop being haunted... FOR FIVE MINUTES!"
[0:50:49] <bbbbuttts1> Does the first just have a normal, ok moon?
[0:50:50] <mythrilcrafter> I got to the Paglathan dungeon, didn't do Paglathan, and instead I just spent the last 3 months goofing around...
[0:50:51] <%Axellogic> @Kaito_Cam I guess? He mentioned it makes numerical sense as someone told him but its less fun to play
[0:50:52] <@MistyMntns> Im angry right now.
[0:50:52] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Another Hunt is on?
[0:51:02] <+xythanshadow> I'm wondering how they are going to twist the Haurchefant or Emet knives in this set.

[0:51:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt what does raubaughn savage mean
[0:51:35] <Psyramics> lot of people waiting until the last minute to finish the MSQ
[0:51:37] <squeakyclarinet> Better a Queue then NOTHING.
[0:51:38] <penitentpendant> We had a newbie JUST finish 5.3. We all pitched in for SoS Normal.

[0:52:39] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt You talking about Raubahn (Savage) on a podcast was what got me into FFXIV.
[0:52:44] <bbHighvalor> pippin ex was what i got stuck on
[0:52:45] <Laecerelius> the instance servers last night were fucked for a bit
[0:52:45] <penitentpendant> @d1stantutopia Fight hasn't lasted long enough for him to build stacks of that
[0:52:56] <56Bagels> this was PRIOR to the first dungeon, so you had NO CHOICE but to do it

[0:53:06] <sandwhichpeddler> The fact that Raubahn Savage was immediately followed by Pipin Extreme was hilarious
[0:53:06] <%BoxNavy> people were forming physical queues right?
[0:53:07] <TeepPhoenix> They had to kill the servers to kick off all the idlers
[0:53:13] <%balkonas1> When's Solar Ash! psaWhat

[0:54:55] <%Frost_Quill> Pokemon fans are right to be annoyed.
[0:54:55] <zerointelligence000> Blizzard still has fans?

[0:54:57] <%W1nterTitan> Poor Lythero...

[0:54:58] <chris_babaganoosh05> Preload should be available in the next hour or so
[0:54:59] <+SolGainer> YEP LUL
[0:54:59] <+JackDemon316> true
[0:55:02] <%RealThiele> it was rough i adapted
[0:55:04] <%Valdorick> Blizzard fans are LEAVING
[0:55:05] <56Bagels> imagine playing WoW in 2021 OmegaLUL
[0:55:05] <AMask777> anything konami
[0:55:08] <%Frost_Quill> Do the Coils.
[0:55:08] <penitentpendant> @SunjammerIV Look at that orb! At least second trimester!
[0:55:09] <toyforus235> titanfalll fans is buried alive
[0:55:11] <%Valdorick> F-Zero fans still have hope
[0:55:11] <%tusk102> bahamuts rad
[0:55:13] <+Man_in_the_Red> nah, theyre supporting a garbage company
[0:55:15] <@TheYellowcouch> he's cool
[0:55:17] <%Frost_Quill> Everyone should do the Coils.
[0:55:18] <%balkonas1> @patstaresat have you played Solar Ash yet?
[0:55:18] <%senorpapel> Imagine being a wow fan
[0:55:19] <+MelodyMedley> How about that Diablos?
[0:55:20] <+SolGainer> Bahamut is kinda important
[0:55:20] <%W1nterTitan> Oh no it was intentional
[0:55:20] <%brisk_dacat> Star Fox fans have nothing
[0:55:21] <%BoxNavy> i only finished coils 2 weeks ago lol
[0:55:23] <%Keyd00d> Do Bahamut
[0:55:24] <%tusk102> bahamut is arr
[0:55:25] <PhilanthropyG> Blizz has the company melting + the truth that WoW doesnt hold up to XIV + the player migration.
[0:55:25] <%Thorlias> hey F ZERO fans haven't had a game or spinoff since 2004 sooooo
[0:55:25] <+kepazhe> i have 1500 hours and the only content I haven't done is binding coils lol
[0:55:25] <%Frost_Quill> If you like Alisaie you should do the Coils.
[0:55:27] <Crackensan> Praise be Lord Bahamut!
[0:55:28] <%Keyd00d> Keyd00d subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[0:55:29] <%Nobrev> I only did coils withing like the last month
[0:55:29] <Cosairen> i summon bahamut :)
[0:55:30] <%LastHazzerd> The ARR optional content is SUPER IMPORTANT
[0:55:32] <ExpressNode> I haven't played the new pokemon game but I believe it would probably be the same experience when I bought it 15 years ago
[0:55:34] <zerointelligence000> i watched the cinematics online so I basically beat it
[0:55:35] <sandwhichpeddler> Do Bahamut if not just for DC Douglas Louisaix
[0:55:35] <engineboi> Bahamut being optional is kinda silly
[0:55:35] <squeakyclarinet> They really need to add Normal modes for Coils...
[0:55:36] <%zepherl> what's up my fellow Enhanced Unmend enjoyers?
[0:55:36] <%RealThiele> coils was recommended by story writer to do before EW
[0:55:41] <+FinetiSonata> coils before heavensward is the best
[0:55:41] <%PatNTheHat> I can't get anyone to do coils 9 with me!
[0:55:44] <%Keyd00d> Rev up that PF
[0:55:44] <%brisk_dacat> Which Bahamut
[0:55:45] <%tusk102> COILS EXPLAINS SOME SHIT
[0:55:45] <%Aeoneth> I solo'd all of coils like a week ago\
[0:55:45] <AlexDaGr8> coils is actually mad, do it
[0:55:45] <+Roundhowl> That’s coils shit should be msq
[0:55:46] <ExpressNode> Meaning no real changes
[0:55:47] <Emperor_Zergg> I saw the game was marked as FF14 and thought they maybe gave Pat streamer favoritism early access and got excited :(
[0:55:48] <%BoxNavy> you can solo unsync coils go do em
[0:55:49] <+polothegreatest> fzero will have a game this gen, i know
[0:55:50] <%SlackerAlex> I did coils randomly during stormblood and was so confused
[0:55:52] <%MaritimeFox> Aw man, I like Alisaie, but Coils queueing is so annoying
[0:55:56] <%BioHunter> i thought HQ was dead?
[0:55:58] <%KineticZen> Plot twist: level 90 is all expert recipes
[0:56:01] <%LastHazzerd> Coils has some amazing scenes
[0:56:07] <%Valdorick> "Oh no, Crafting might be braindead...... so anyway"
[0:56:08] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt are macros required?
[0:56:09] <%tanarath> Pat, did you hear that US State Governments ate going to start voting out Activision Board members if Kotick doesn't resign, and can do so because they have money invested in Activision?
[0:56:11] <LiulfrJ> I really wanted a final coils clear this last week but everyone only wanted moogle tomestones or synced blind runs for some reason
[0:56:12] <%RealThiele> coils can be 2-manned unsyned tho
[0:56:14] <%KineticZen> HQ materials are dead, not finished products
[0:56:17] <SummonerMagno> unsynch coils, steamroll bahamut
[0:56:18] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Just double checking, can you unsynch Coils?
[0:56:20] <thunderborn32> no because you can use material to make HQ items and you will make HQ gear with HQ items
[0:56:21] <Baljhet> @BioHunter HQ gathers are, crafted items can still be HQ
[0:56:25] <%senorpapel> Cp gonna become the best stat imo
[0:56:27] <%atteroproxy> Maybe I'll be able to solo the Stormblood content now
[0:56:27] <penitentpendant> @BioHunter HQ from gatherers. Item crafts and Tier 2 mats will still have HQ.
[0:56:30] <%Nobrev> @BioHunter HQ mats for gatherers are dead but crafters can still make HQ stuff
[0:56:30] <%shirou_kokkan> @patstaresat I have unfortunately not finished Omega and they said it would be important for the story. I'm panicking
[0:56:33] <NeonBleu> the servers will melt
[0:56:35] <%Starotter70> Starotter70 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! A fun Easter egg for SMT V, you can see what alignment you're leaning towards by the spinning icon on the overworld, clockwise for law, counter for chaos, none for neutral. That aside, have fun with the FF14's
[0:56:38] <%Aeoneth> @KineticZen interim materials can still be HQ
[0:56:48] <%tusk102> @senorpapel yet again the worst acronym
[0:56:48] <iosephe> yup
[0:56:48] <%RealThiele> sage gives you free SMN
[0:56:49] <%KineticZen> I count that as a product
[0:56:50] <%BioHunter> oohhhhhhhh
[0:56:50] <+Roundelay11> Get that bonus
[0:56:51] <%JamesCorck> Yepp, yepp, doing it boss.
[0:56:51] <%LastHazzerd> the EXP bonus is nice
[0:56:52] <+PMAvers> Unless you *really* hate your current class.
[0:56:52] <@TheYellowcouch> 100% ARMOURY BONUS
[0:56:53] <penitentpendant> "Armory Bonus!"
[0:56:53] <%RealThiele> err SCH
[0:56:56] <+SolGainer> Armory bonus is important
[0:56:59] <%JamesCorck> I will put Dragoon to 80.
[0:57:01] <peyodogo> protip for everyone who didn't replay coils before endwalker: ng+ allows you to see all the fight cutscenes without having to do them! they knew they were a pain to queue for and not viable for everyone to solo/get pals for
[0:57:01] <+Toshatron> armoury is 100% now
[0:57:01] <%stoatacious> ARMORY BONUS IS 100% NOW
[0:57:07] <%JamesCorck> Yepp, yepp.
[0:57:07] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:57:10] <%W0rldsAStage> where'd ya get the cool cactuar shirt?
[0:57:10] <%BoxNavy> 100% armoury bonus coneyVINCE
[0:57:14] <thunderborn32> \o/ everythings already 80
[0:57:18] <%Aeoneth> 100% until 80, 50% after that
[0:57:18] <%LastHazzerd> Arcanists get TWO jobs
[0:57:22] <%senorpapel> @tusk102  lol
[0:57:23] <%tusk102> im fucking dumb and have levelled 11 classes to 50 instead of just progressing the story
[0:57:24] <%atteroproxy> I am not excited about leveling as at base value again
[0:57:25] <+Wolfstriker121> leveling a reaper is gonna be crazy in day one lol
[0:57:26] <Ciglossonjr> The armoury bonus has always been 100% from 1-70
[0:57:33] <AlexDaGr8> finals fantasy PogChamp
[0:57:33] <LiulfrJ> me and a friend capped in sb before the new dungeon and had to start sch and drk just to get xp from msq
[0:57:34] <%ThirdWelles> @patstaresat Armory bonus has been 100% at every level until ten from cap since Heavensward
[0:57:34] <%zepherl> average Heart of Corundum fan VS THE ENHANCED UNMEND INTO PLUNGE ENJOYER!!!
[0:57:36] <%BoxNavy> there is no chance that it will outright suck
[0:57:44] <+Roundelay11> I still haven't worked up the enthusiasm to level BLU
[0:57:45] <+MelodyMedley> It would be surprising
[0:57:46] <Cosairen> that would be fuckin crazy since theres never been a bad expansion
[0:57:48] <CheesesSliced> PSA: It's pronounced Bahamoot. Kneel before my wisdom, you ignorant rabble
[0:57:49] <+polothegreatest> Would you buy the FF14 cookbook?
[0:57:49] <+Akizea> i'd be flabbergasted tbh
[0:57:50] <%MaritimeFox> You'd have to give them a golf clap if Endwalker sucked
[0:57:54] <%shirou_kokkan> So finish leveling my GNB before reaper and sage?
[0:57:56] <%Aeoneth> I think only an act of INTENTIONAL SABOTAGE could possible make it suck
[0:57:58] <+TheoryTiddles> Is the bonus based on your highest job in general or highest job of the same role??
[0:57:59] <%RealThiele> yea zero chance it could suck but i could see it only being good
[0:58:08] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if it looks directly at the camera and tells you to do heroin?
[0:58:10] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt im a crazy person and levelled my scholar above 60 before hitting heavensward
[0:58:10] <%KineticZen> Ackshually it's Baphomet
[0:58:11] <%commanderapathy> I'd be devastated
[0:58:12] <+SatChamp> sue time
[0:58:12] <Ginganinja4545> Endwalker cant suck because summoner is a real job now
[0:58:13] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS ALMOST LIKE UNION DUES ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO WAGE THEFT
[0:58:17] <+TheoryTiddles> Claled Goku
[0:58:17] <Cosairen> @CheesesSliced not in 14 :)
[0:58:18] <%Frost_Quill> @TheoryTiddles Highest job in general.
[0:58:18] <%Logoth_> Necron!
[0:58:19] <+TheoryTiddles> :)
[0:58:23] <%shurtal> Final boss is Tataru
[0:58:24] <AMask777> Tataru Savage
[0:58:26] <%chiazam> Everyone dies
[0:58:27] <+TheoryTiddles> @Frost_Quill  thank you boss
[0:58:27] <%Aeoneth> Yeeeee Zeromus is the shit
[0:58:27] <%Monkeyweed21> it was in fact wage theft yea
[0:58:28] <squeakyclarinet> like what?
[0:58:29] <%RealThiele> starting with an H
[0:58:30] <NeverNotNinja> The final trial's going to be called 'The End'
[0:58:31] <%Valdorick> Necromus
[0:58:33] <%valriot> Its gonna be Bofa
[0:58:34] <ExpressNode> Oh boy I've been wage thefted for 4 months now and still fighting it
[0:58:34] <RaidenRising> tataru
[0:58:35] <sirtommygunn> could also be tax withholding
[0:58:36] <%tanarath> @monkeyweed21 unpossible.
[0:58:38] <@TheYellowcouch> DIRECTOR OF THE WORLD: YOSHI P
[0:58:39] <%senorpapel> Anyone know when the game will be downloadable?
[0:58:40] <+MelodyMedley> It was Tataru all along
[0:58:45] <cthulewd> See i've got my main character, who's a color mage; WHITE RED BLACK AND BLUE. And my secondary who's doing every other job (because fuck leveling BLM again).
[0:58:46] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @Monkeyweed21 But my boss told me that the union would steal all my money, why would he lie??
[0:58:48] <%RealThiele> Hydilark or some such
[0:58:50] <GrandmasterGrimalkyne> I hope the servers won't die for 3 days  after we had to wait so long for this maintenance to end
[0:58:52] <Vakojin> Really wonder how Anima's trial will look like.
[0:58:57] <+VantaLow> whats it like to play old content when a new expansion comes out? Like is it dead everywhere?
[0:58:59] <%BoxNavy> ewwwww
[0:59:00] <Baljhet> ew
[0:59:01] <%tusk102> ew
[0:59:02] <Cosairen> yeah i got into 14 because of you back after raubahn ex
[0:59:03] <%Logoth_> UWU
[0:59:03] <%BoxNavy> unless it sucks
[0:59:05] <treesy2> Tataru's a reaper, and her dark spirit will be Godbert Manderville
[0:59:05] <+Roundhowl> Absolute virtue
[0:59:05] <%shurtal> Eee-dub
[0:59:06] <%Nobrev> my knowledge of ff12 lore is making me have some big questions about how endwalker is gonna unfold
[0:59:08] <+melonabun> enwa
[0:59:10] <penitentpendant> Oh no, EW is here to stay
[0:59:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid the Union will steal less money than a shitty boss
[0:59:12] <+blue_cloak552> I just call it END
[0:59:12] <%ragingsystem> END
[0:59:12] <Profmcstevie> END works well
[0:59:13] <FazzleRazzle> unless its bad, than it will be ew
[0:59:13] <%RealThiele> anima seems like a 83 trial
[0:59:14] <@TheYellowcouch> I see some people trying to make END a thing.
[0:59:15] <%Keyd00d> Nope I'm callin it EW
[0:59:17] <+tempestzephyr> ewww
[0:59:17] <%BoxNavy> oh god
[0:59:21] <%baka_sugoi> C R A Z Y PAT
[0:59:22] <%miabyte> what if we decided to use END instead
[0:59:24] <+JustToWatch> you are unhinged though
[0:59:25] <+Toshatron> Those are only positives
[0:59:26] <%RealThiele> more unhinged
[0:59:28] <wolfen091> even more unhinged?!
[0:59:28] <%MegadBlitz> hello semi egg pat

[0:59:42] <%BigCoffee> Pat weren't you gonna go Bunny boy for EW ?
[0:59:43] <iosephe> Yeah
[0:59:44] <+polothegreatest> red bull sponsored
[0:59:45] <%cvp5127> would they?
[0:59:46] <%psydaku> Calling it now: Fandaniel is just Zeno's reaper avatar.
[0:59:46] <%BoxNavy> oh shit...
[0:59:47] <%stoatacious> nooo
[0:59:47] <%valriot> probably
[0:59:48] <@TheYellowcouch> would they really do that so soon?
[0:59:48] <%chiazam> THE TRUE GOBLIN PAT SHALL EMERGE
[0:59:49] <squeakyclarinet> I don't think they will.
[0:59:50] <%Rumbutt> 18 months from now but yeah
[0:59:51] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> but I prefer wild untamed Pat
[0:59:52] <PanicSwytch> I hope they do
[0:59:54] <zerointelligence000> It makes sense but the copypasta would haveto be updated
[0:59:54] <+Wolfstriker121> they may will
[0:59:55] <%RocketBarrel> That's too damn much for being free if they did
[0:59:55] <+Ed_The_Crimson> I would love a fight where we fight Hydaelyn and one of the tanks has to block her kamen rider kick like when you block susano's sword.
[0:59:56] <%Valdorick> Naaaaaaah
[0:59:56] <T_Sasquatch> I would personally lose my shit
[0:59:56] <%d1stantutopia> they fucking will, won't they
[1:00:00] <+Kyma1020> That's three games for free
[1:00:02] <CheesesSliced> Pat gets discounts on his haircuts
[1:00:03] <%Frost_Quill> @psydaku Fuck that's good.
[1:00:06] <squeakyclarinet> There's already more than enough for a trial.
[1:00:06] <%Nuclearcherries> That's a lot of game
[1:00:06] <+Trylorf> they 100% will
[1:00:07] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:00:08] <AlexDaGr8> i would be gobsmacked if they added to the free trial, it's already so much bigger than any other game

[1:29:05] <%NeoCre> NeoCre subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! Hi Pat, just wanted to make a small correction after listening to you guys wonder how B4B ended up inferior to L4D2 on the podcast. Turtle Rock only worked on L4D and was contracted to work on some post-launch content for L4D2. Valve developed L4D2 inhous
[1:29:05] <+Anaguma_no_Koe> Bunker is great but the others were boring
[1:29:07] <%Frost_Quill> I like Paradigm's Breach.
[1:29:08] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I like the Bunker, but yeah. Tower's just kind of a slog
[1:29:09] <%ShogunNoonto> i didn't do them what happen
[1:29:10] <%0oki> great glamour thouhg
[1:29:11] <%BigCoffee> Ivalice raids was cringe
[1:29:11] <@JustinianKnight> bunker is my least fav lol
[1:29:12] <PhilanthropyG> the IDEA of paradigm shift is cool...but I can only stomach so much white.
[1:29:13] <mortificent> what?
[1:29:14] <+greatersea> paradigm's breach still gives me headaches, I can't imagine how bad it was on launch
[1:29:14] <InXplotch> paradigm's last fight has great music
[1:29:15] <%QuasarKnightGaming> They are a very cool thing. They are also a pain in the ass.
[1:29:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Bunker is cool
[1:29:16] <@QueequegTheater> They're no Orbonne I tell you hwat
[1:29:17] <%senorpapel> ivalice raids are prolly best alliance raids so far
[1:29:18] <freefa> incorrect!
[1:29:20] <%TeepPhoenix> My favorite part of the Final Alexander song is when Soken and the Primals performed it live, they performed the time stop mechanic live on stage.
[1:29:20] <+SolGainer> The Tower has the shittiest boss right in the middle
[1:29:21] <NRhyme> Ivalice needs to be nuked
[1:29:21] <%CalderGaming> FINALLY
[1:29:21] <%JGardner03> Oh man Battlefield is gone...

[1:29:26] <@TheYellowcouch> I'll never get tired of seeing people get yeeted in tower
[1:29:27] <ValkahRoctsteel> Pretty hard to top the Ivalice raids
[1:29:30] <+Kyma1020> finally they're free!
[1:29:31] <mr_saturday93> REALLY!?
[1:29:33] <XyraFhoan> I like the raids but it's no Orbonne
[1:29:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That cutscene for the last boss of paragim  SUCKS
[1:29:35] <@TheYellowcouch> Imagine if battlefield was halo
[1:29:37] <%MrBorisMakarov> people just want ivalice again
[1:29:37] <%InternetShis> NO
[1:29:37] <@QueequegTheater> Wow, Halo REALLY ate their lunch
[1:29:37] <$ringabal> Pfft, it'll never take off...
[1:29:38] <Archmortal> the NieR raids are my favorite content in the game
[1:29:38] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> OOoooooo mind blown
[1:29:41] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Its way too long
[1:29:42] <%kainhighwind1990> Am I the only one that loves the Titania music?
[1:29:43] <NeonBleu> BattleFall
[1:29:43] <MidnightPacif1c> thatd be pretty poggers
[1:29:44] <%MidnightBurst12> DICE HIRE THAT MAN
[1:29:44] <%InternetShis> NOONONONONNOONONNONOONO
[1:29:44] <%SatChamp> thats just cod advanced warfare
[1:29:45] <%twistedj3ster> wasn't that just Advanced Warfare or w/e?
[1:29:47] <%WhereIsWill> BATTLEFALL
[1:29:57] <@TheYellowcouch> Bozja all the way
[1:29:58] <+doctor_brofessor> best 24 man I played so far was the Orbonne Monastery, so good
[1:29:59] <%InternetShis> NO MORE ADVANCED MOVEEMNT
[1:30:03] <@JustinianKnight> leveling dungeons or bozja
[1:30:04] <%PMAvers> What if... the next Battlefield brought back the giant robots from 2142. I want to see like hundreds of these.. what will we call these "titans?"... on the battlefield at one time.
[1:30:06] <Sydin18> I AM TRYING TO TELL THEM THAT
[1:30:07] <%ThreeEightySix> ThreeEightySix subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Any chance that that unnamed zone they showed off for Endwalker has Zeal references?
[1:30:07] <%RealThiele> yea HoH is like 60-70
[1:30:10] <@QueequegTheater> Spam skirmishes in Zadnor
[1:30:11] <%BoxNavy> going from 70-80 in hoh sounds like hell
[1:30:12] <+SolGainer> HoH is for 60-70, not 70-80
[1:30:13] <Archmortal> @kainhighwind1990 nah her music is fantastic, but the competition for best trial music is FIERCE
[1:30:13] <%senorpapel> bozja leveling is stronger than whatever idea you have
[1:30:14] <InXplotch> ivalice's tragedy is it feels so unfun playing your level 60 kit in it, lol. I almost wish there was a way to do older raids scaled to your full kit.
[1:30:16] <%CzeekyTV> unless you have a pre-made party to run dungeons with, bozja should be the fastest
[1:30:17] <%d1stantutopia> What if we just give Bottlefeld money to Titanfall for TF3 and make that EA's main FPS game?
[1:30:20] <%shurtal> well, gotta ge one level, THEN do Bozja
[1:30:20] <@TheYellowcouch> Happy birth!!
[1:30:20] <Kain5707> HoH who the fuck is going to run that
[1:30:21] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Congratsx

[1:33:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> PSA from YoshiP: Use Instance 3 for screenshots to avoid clogging quest NPCs for those who want to go through the story
[1:33:15] <marvel877> That makes more sense.
[1:33:18] <%ultimafreya> I want flan princess mount

[1:33:54] <%azacca_bitter> you don't actually go to the moon, you pay stanley kubrick to make it look like you did
[1:33:55] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Further from Yoshi P: Doing role quests isn't required for MSQ, but he'd like to recommend you do your role quest alongside the MSQ (at the relevant level) because the quest and the MSQ line up in terms of timeline and work well together.
[1:33:56] <%BoxNavy> bye forever jermaPluto
[1:33:56] <+SladeClegane> Below the lake, yes sir
[1:33:56] <%senorpapel> wooo launcher upodate

[1:34:06] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> @chiazam i believe so
[1:34:10] <ValkahRoctsteel> Going to go into the crystal core
[1:34:17] <%RealThiele> launcher y you no update :(
[1:34:17] <+SiegmundCG> What does Patch Tier List mean?
[1:34:24] <Vermillion129> Yea I’m guessing silvertear lake where midgardsomr yeet that giant ship in 1.0 trailer
[1:34:27] <%Agami23> superflux is on steam too. it crazy looking
[1:34:31] <%QuasarKnightGaming> @chiazam @chiazam Yep
[1:34:33] <Profmcstevie> tier list of the patches of FF14
[1:34:37] <%TeepPhoenix> Ranking how cool each patch wa
[1:34:39] <%TeepPhoenix> was
[1:34:44] <MidnightPacif1c> romollaJam
[1:34:59] <%TeepPhoenix> Which almost seems unfair with 5.3 there.
[1:35:06] <+Wolfstriker121> im getting a ff 14 launcher error anyone know how to fix since people they said launcher update is live?
[1:35:09] <%BoxNavy> chjbDance
[1:35:15] <+Anaguma_no_Koe> It's downloading now woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:35:17] <%TeepPhoenix> restart the launcher?
[1:35:19] <+SiegmundCG> oh i thought he was gonna judge make a classes tier list from the patch notes alone like Leffen
[1:35:20] <boogaleeboo> 3.3 is no slouch, but yeah 5.3 is going to win
[1:35:25] <+uncle_emoji> Eye patch is S-tier. Nicotine patch maybe C-tier
[1:35:27] <+DotRook> I got the launcher error too
[1:35:29] <+Wolfstriker121> tryed restarting it
[1:35:34] <%PMAvers> I completely exited the launcher and waited a few minutes. It may be rolling out in waves.
[1:35:34] <%ThirdWelles> You just have to restart the launcher until it works, pretty much
[1:35:35] <+DotRook> I had to try a few times but it finally updated the launcher
[1:35:36] <%Sunriser41> i just gave up and reinstalled the whole thing
[1:35:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Wolfstriker121 live for some people. that mean's it isnt up yet for you
[1:35:39] <NRhyme> Wonder if Pat will deepdive into the current patch notes. Some of the job changes seem... odd?
[1:35:40] <Vermillion129> 5.3 is the vergil of FF14 tier list
[1:35:45] <%GreasyDratini> Do you have to reinstall the game if you get the error?
[1:35:45] <%LastHazzerd> Re-Load
[1:35:50] <NRhyme> Same, had to reinstall.
[1:35:55] <%ThirdWelles> It's rolling out in waves for sure. Just keep rechecking until it works for you
[1:35:56] <+Rowan2689> manually restart the launcher, don't let it auto restart from the error
[1:36:01] <BreakfastSampler> @Wolfstriker121 open FFXIV_BOOT.cfg in your Documents/MyGames/FFXIV folder and change bootversioncheckmode from 0 to 1
[1:36:03] <%QuasarKnightGaming> @uncle_emoji How dare you not tweet this at him, thats golden
[1:36:03] <+DotRook> I didnt have to reinstall.  I think I just got lucky
[1:36:11] <+DotRook> it did take a few attempts
[1:36:21] <+RelikaNox> Can confirm changing the number in the boot config fixes it
[1:36:22] <mortificent> @GreasyDratini not really, had the error first, but now it's downloading
[1:36:24] <%PatNTheHat> @GreasyDratini Not necessarily. I had it eventually work for me
[1:36:28] <%senorpapel> also for anyone who likes to theorycraft/speculate. go to the 6.0 patch notes, read the known issues section regarding the gods of eld quest
[1:36:34] <+SergeEXE> already downloaded muh d00ds. feels good
[1:36:34] <%Sunriser41> oh well, hopefully the download and fix is done aftter i wake up
[1:36:37] <+Rowan2689> click from icon to open it once it closes, don't let it auto restart, and just keep trying
[1:36:44] <%Conzanagi> @SmiteKnight Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:36:52] <+uncle_emoji> Patch Adams low-tier
[1:37:17] <NRhyme> What about Trusty Patches?
[1:37:18] <+Wolfstriker121> ok got it now its working ty chat

[1:37:33] <Cosairen> preloaded and it feels so good

[1:44:48] <Louie_Salmon> Ardbert looks so much more boyish here
[1:44:48] <toyforus235> audio?
[1:44:48] <Archmortal> So the entire premise of... was it 5.2 or 5.3 comes from this trailer
[1:44:49] <%RealThiele> saved by garlemald
[1:44:49] <%Bane_Kaikyo> wtf are those?
[1:44:50] <+NYCrownlessKing> the trailer makes the game sound like its being played through a tuba @PatStaresAt
[1:44:59] <+NYCrownlessKing> what's with the sound lol
[1:45:00] <+NeonLight> Youre finally awake! You were trying to cross the border!
[1:45:01] <NRhyme> Wouldn't catch me flying one
[1:45:06] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Garlean Juggernauts baybeee
[1:45:07] <%croxeye> Now that SMN as DOT/status class is officially dead, does that mean wer'e gonna get another job that is the DOT/status class instead? and can it be Chemist?
[1:45:08] <$ringabal> Ardbert's No Good, Horrible, Very Bad Day
[1:45:09] <Vermillion129> GarleN ship
[1:45:10] <%BoxNavy> chjbDance
[1:45:11] <+Cykaima> @NYCrownlessKing garlean airships
[1:45:19] <%Gasgrave> I like randomly finding the wreckage of these ships in the different zones
[1:45:19] <zerointelligence000> I want those stupid tube ships as a mount
[1:45:20] <%Eaglestrike117> hey look its silvertear
[1:45:23] <%InternetShis> Chube
[1:45:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> ya garlean airtubes Kappa @Cykaima
[1:45:30] <Cosairen> @croxeye we already have bard LUL
[1:45:30] <+gitgouda> this looks like something you would fly in the backwater portion of starwars
[1:45:30] <+Kyma1020> This has to be relevant
[1:45:35] <%AHomeschoolDropout> IS THAT THE VOID ARK
[1:45:35] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> derplanders very bad day
[1:45:36] <$ringabal> THERE HE IS
[1:45:38] <%TeepPhoenix> Isn't this the Ascian battle theme?
[1:45:38] <+NeonLight> Middy!!
[1:45:38] <PhilanthropyG> I like to imagine the Garlean tech is primitive at this phase of history, and they are a rapidly advancing civilization, given their rapid expansion of land and resources.
[1:45:39] <%BoxNavy> @croxeye bard :)
[1:45:42] <%InternetShis> Imagine if this was a mount
[1:45:43] <%CzeekyTV> eyy it's the Agrius?
[1:45:43] <+Cykaima> this cutscene fucking rocks man
[1:45:43] <Latija> @croxeye my guess is a poison based Chemist, or a plague/curse based Necromancer
[1:45:44] <Arqartur0> Panzer DRagoon!
[1:45:44] <%NocturneNovember> GRANDPA
[1:45:46] <jau_twitch> man he could've died SO FAST in this
[1:45:46] <%InternetShis> DAD

[1:45:47] <%kysath> Uncle Midgard PogChamp

[1:45:49] <+SergeEXE> "What's Under Silvertear" is def coming back
[1:45:50] <+Cykaima> THE AGRIUS
[1:45:52] <NRhyme> I wish BRD got SMN's Bane skill.
[1:45:52] <Cosairen> @AHomeschoolDropout thats the agrius
[1:45:54] <%atteroproxy> This wouldn't be a problem if you were a reaction video youtuber
[1:45:55] <%UvBenServed> YEYEYEYEYEY BEST BOI
[1:45:55] <+Anaguma_no_Koe> GRANDPA?!
[1:45:56] <zerointelligence000> Hi middy
[1:45:57] <%stoatacious> it's fine now
[1:45:57] <stealthfart> Retcons everywhere and I’ve always thought of this as as adventure for Ardbert and crew. I’m not doing the class quests for his guys. I don’t have the patience to heal or build up a magic dps
[1:45:58] <%DianaTheAscian> OH ITS GRANDPA
[1:45:58] <%Jeemukun> Midgardsomr?
[1:45:58] <%LastHazzerd> Middy
[1:46:06] <@TheYellowcouch> Dragon daddy!
[1:46:07] <%BoxNavy> ye
[1:46:08] <%Wallabri> GRANDPA MIDDY
[1:46:12] <Louie_Salmon> For one thing, they got a lot better at directing trailers after this.
[1:46:14] <+Cykaima> tuba fart audio
[1:46:15] <PhilanthropyG> just grappled it
[1:46:16] <+LittleCinders> @patstaresat The reupload of this makes me think Silvertear & More Dhona are gonna be important in EW
[1:46:16] <%coward_man> yeyeye Middy!
[1:46:19] <$ringabal> GRAND DAD
[1:46:19] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[1:46:20] <%skeletonmilk> Middy is a fucking chill bro
[1:46:20] <Cosairen> WHAT A BALLER
[1:46:22] <%TheDugness> damn

[1:46:23] <count_bob> The original DILF.
[1:46:24] <%LastHazzerd> now he smol and sit on head
[1:46:24] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt What do you think Middy was protecting
[1:46:24] <%Gasgrave> and blew a hole in Silvertear Lake
[1:46:27] <%YakumoYomi> Sounds fine
[1:46:29] <xxshadowxx416> still deiing
[1:46:29] <%stoatacious> big fartz
[1:46:31] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Mor Dhona looked so nice before
[1:46:31] <dan_g_v> sounds good
[1:46:31] <Arqartur0> See, an MMO based on FF7 would've been MUCH better
[1:46:32] <%RealThiele> ate shit doin it tho
[1:46:32] <@TheYellowcouch> It's good I jsut think the mixing on the actual trailer is off
[1:46:33] <%skeletonmilk> the audio is wonky af as fuck
[1:46:33] <+Cykaima> bad
[1:46:34] <%GarbageNirvana> So this all happened before the start of 1.0 right
[1:46:34] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt did you ever touch 1.0 Pat?
[1:46:35] <+NeonLight> its the pose!
[1:46:35] <zerointelligence000> Middy is Daddy
[1:46:36] <BigYanno> it's kinda hard to tell when it's all just BOOM
[1:46:38] <boogaleeboo> And now one of the least explained things in all of FFXIV
[1:46:38] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> this is how Mhor dhona got fucked beyond belief too
[1:46:41] <%sonuke_draws> pose
[1:46:42] <+cappyd33> you are my dad You're My Dad! Boogie woogie woogie
[1:46:43] <%kainhighwind1990> wait is that the ship from that dungeon in the post ARR patches?
[1:46:44] <@StridentSong> Good now. The trailer has some weird mixing spots that spike up
[1:46:45] <%chiazam> Thats so low
[1:46:46] <%beepbeepbopbop> Better?
[1:46:47] <Archmortal> I just can't believe how many times fire from the sky is being depicted
[1:46:47] <+SolGainer> Incoming noncanon LUL
[1:46:48] <%livlinn> livlinn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Good luck on Endwalking journey o7
[1:46:49] <%InternetShis> And that's how the aether came about
[1:46:51] <Latija> retcon incoming
[1:46:53] <%stoatacious> yo pat what's under silvertear lake?
[1:46:54] <%beepbeepbopbop> Can still hear, but I have headphones.
[1:46:55] <%croxeye> NIGHTMARE
[1:46:56] <Vermillion129> Endwalker is time travel back to 1.0 era or some bad shit in is silvertear lake PogChamp
[1:46:56] <%BoxNavy> dude what does this MEAN
[1:46:58] <xxshadowxx416> still not syne and fart
[1:46:59] <NRhyme> I watched some 1.0 cutscenes. Shit looked great.
[1:46:59] <+GingerSen> so that makes no sense
[1:47:00] <%BoxNavy> WHY PRIMALS?
[1:47:01] <dan_g_v> who is that?
[1:47:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Like I thought the Echo could only look backwards in time
[1:47:02] <%DianaTheAscian> THE PRIMALS
[1:47:03] <%InternetShis> Not real
[1:47:03] <+gitgouda> 1.0 dosnt exist, it cant hurt you chat its ok.
[1:47:05] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Was that the ship from that one dungeon in the post-ARR patches?
[1:47:05] <%Nobrev> same
[1:47:06] <%Agami23> that would make sense
[1:47:07] <+LittleCinders> Same
[1:47:08] <Cosairen> well we know that silvertear is the basically the magic north pole so this will def be important
[1:47:08] <Latija> hollow earth?
[1:47:09] <koffeemancer> did you cut all the trailers to fit together seamlessly pat?
[1:47:10] <InXplotch> that would be crazy
[1:47:10] <+Roundelay11> I just don't buy that this is supposed to be Ardbert
[1:47:10] <Neptious> We are there are screenshots
[1:47:11] <%LastHazzerd> my summons!
[1:47:13] <+セビー> i played 1.0 long enough to go back to XI for a few more years
[1:47:14] <+SladeClegane> Definitely
[1:47:15] <%walternatorz> 100% why they uploaded this video
[1:47:16] <Arqartur0> Tripping Balls there?

[1:47:22] <%chiazam> Healing Coma time
[1:47:22] <%Frost_Quill> Oh the echo.
[1:47:23] <Torenology> I bet that's what that crystal area from the trailer is
[1:47:23] <%TeepPhoenix> Shut up Urianger
[1:47:24] <nilla_24> she's creepy
[1:47:25] <+CrantoPSS> oh shit gwint in ff14?
[1:47:25] <+Shoosler> yikes that face
[1:47:26] <%InternetShis> All cause of a gathering leve
[1:47:27] <NRhyme> I really don't like the English voice acting...
[1:47:27] <%funya_rinpa> Oh god, she looks terrifying
[1:47:27] <bottom_feeder88> dudes not alright
[1:47:27] <+NYCrownlessKing> so you're saying..we will be going into the.. LIFE STREAM of the planet? @PatStaresAt
[1:47:27] <%croxeye> @GarbageNirvana Mikoto's echo bit is to look into the future
[1:47:28] <%Sunriser41> man her ears are so weird moving around
[1:47:28] <Louie_Salmon> Oof that face
[1:47:29] <+NeonLight> Remember back when we were able to summon Ifrit? Man, would be crazy to bring that back, ha...
[1:47:29] <%RealThiele> leves covered in acid
[1:47:30] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I like how she looks more menacing than anime adorable
[1:47:31] <InXplotch> where in the story of 1.0 does middy blow up the ship anyway? its not late into it is it?
[1:47:33] <+teebos> jesus christ
[1:47:34] <%skeletonmilk> what's wrong with your FACE
[1:47:36] <+greatersea> oh yeah, remember the "sound" from silvertear on echo-users could hear? and how midgardsomr is guarding the lake? :)

[1:47:42] <%Nobrev> he talked
[1:47:43] <stormhawk9891> HE TALKS
[1:47:45] <%coward_man> considering how old this trailer is the CG holds up
[1:47:46] <%rindy0> wait are these two the archer and black mage?
[1:47:49] <%Frost_Quill> WE SPOKE???
[1:47:51] <@SpaceCapnCrone> @InXplotch It happens a good while before 1.0
[1:47:52] <%livlinn> in world VR is wild
[1:47:52] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:47:53] <+GingerSen> Oh. theme of final fantasy. <3
[1:47:53] <+Cykaima> Silvertear lake had a massive fucking pool of liquid aether underneath it which was penetrated by the agrius exploding, unleashing a shit ton of aether into mor dhona and scarring the land barren
[1:47:55] <Jaysky> @Mr_ZombieFetish More for me
[1:47:56] <%BoxNavy> thats ardberts VA right?
[1:47:56] <+NeonLight> That neck though!
[1:47:57] <%PMAvers> "Man, you've been staring at that hand of Triple Triad cards for like six hours. I'm going to have to call a judge."
[1:47:59] <%LastHazzerd> i remember that line specifically
[1:48:03] <%Frost_Quill> @rindy0 Kind of.
[1:48:03] <+boybyfresh> and he never did it again
[1:48:03] <%GarbageNirvana> @croxeye Do you see Mikoto anywhere in this cutscene
[1:48:03] <mr_saturday93> why is his neck so long?
[1:48:04] <+gitgouda> not gonna say anything of the horrific vision. nice
[1:48:04] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype

[1:48:06] <Latija> and then it sucked shit
[1:48:08] <%TeepPhoenix> They didn't have bards in Legacy!
[1:48:09] <skullneedles> god the animation in 1.0 is brautiful
[1:48:09] <RadShiro> Maybe Silvertear lake has the Summoning world like from FF4 and 6
[1:48:11] <%shanna_become_gamer> dude yeah, what is that neck
[1:48:12] <funkerbuster> speaking lines on my WOL?

[1:49:23] <tacotaskforce> Game almost bad enough to kill the entire company.
[1:49:24] <%Saadi90> NA
[1:49:24] <%Ebonyglow> it should go in N

[1:49:28] <Vermillion129> Solid E for endwalker foreshadowing
[1:49:28] <%isolex_> NIGHTMARE
[1:49:29] <Johndagger17> Game so bad, they made it twice
[1:49:29] <Archmortal> It's a terrible trailer BUT MY GOD THE FORESHADOWING
[1:49:30] <%PMAvers> I mean, the trailer was... fine
[1:49:30] <funkerbuster> BibleThump
[1:49:30] <sirtommygunn> but that trailer though
[1:49:30] <Sol_Install> I was gonna say D or C
[1:49:32] <%DianaTheAscian> The noclip doc is great

[1:49:34] <Sol_Install> but yea F make sense

[1:49:36] <%LastHazzerd> good trailer for a bad game
[1:49:36] <Dopamien> trailer or game?
[1:49:36] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Cylva lookin good in the trailer tho
[1:49:36] <%walternatorz> the documentary was more enjoyable than the game
[1:49:36] <+Wolfstriker121> trailer was good tho
[1:49:36] <+SladeClegane> Rating something you didn’t play, huh?
[1:49:37] <%BoxNavy> poo poo chjbBoClap
[1:49:37] <SaltyGuyMan> trailer is good tho
[1:49:38] <spryte333> it's a good documentary tho
[1:49:39] <InXplotch> NEXT
[1:49:39] <%coward_man> gigantic disaster
[1:49:40] <%SolumFuturae> B for nearly Bankrupted squeenix
[1:49:41] <zerointelligence000> game so bad it almost took the company with it
[1:49:41] <%atteroproxy> Are we rating trailers or the content that the trailers represent?
[1:49:42] <majindusto> IT SHOULD  BE N/A
[1:49:44] <Arqartur0> AND YET YOU STILL PLAY IT PATT
[1:49:45] <+Dwarven_Gaming> wheres E?
[1:49:46] <%NitronStreams> Game so nice they made it twice
[1:49:48] <%atteroproxy> Ahh
[1:49:48] <%Gasgrave> F in that case
[1:49:49] <Kain5707> you said trailer did you not?
[1:49:50] <Chaos_Aether> oooooooooooooooh
[1:49:50] <$StrawberryPantsu> Oh
[1:49:50] <+Wolfstriker121> AHH then the game was shit lol!!
[1:49:52] <%Agami23> that came out only a few years after ff13. the time of garbage
[1:49:52] <Sol_Install> OK
[1:49:53] <Chaos_Aether> F
[1:49:54] <BigYanno> that trailer was pretty cool, shame about the game
[1:49:55] <Sol_Install> GAME THAN F
[1:49:56] <%KineticZen> It's objectively F
[1:49:57] <toyforus235> what patch?
[1:49:58] <%chiazam> It should be the only one ever in F
[1:49:58] <TimesApex> 1.0 isn't N/A?
[1:50:00] <+NiktenKing> FF
[1:50:00] <stealthfart> How are you rating trailers?
[1:50:00] <+GingerSen> Ah gotcha
[1:50:01] <sirtommygunn> ok but whats your trailer rating
[1:50:01] <Profmcstevie> The trailers are for us, the tier list is for the content
[1:50:02] <Louie_Salmon> I don't think the trailer was that good either. It was way too long
[1:50:02] <funkerbuster> trailer > game so sure i guess
[1:50:03] <%tomdwarf> Make N/A "Yoshi-p Nightmare", and only put 1.0 in it.
[1:50:03] <%DianaTheAscian> BOY ARE THEY
[1:50:05] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> N/A for Absolute Nightmare
[1:50:05] <Oak_bogle> You need to be like Toby Ziegler and light it on fire and then put it in the trash @patstaresat
[1:50:06] <%RealThiele> BIG F
[1:50:07] <boogaleeboo> There's some really fucking wildly bad design decisions in 1.0. Like not even "They tried a thing that failed", but "They tried a thing tat was itself a fundamentally bad idea, and also did it badly".
[1:50:09] <+Greywyn00> like that one LUL
[1:50:10] <Sol_Install> OK
[1:50:12] <%shadowsofpain> multiple Docs lol
[1:50:13] <SaltyGuyMan> oh then f for sure
[1:50:14] <%Puhff> us why 1.o was bad
[1:50:15] <InXplotch> 1.0 should be NIGHTMARE tier
[1:50:17] <NRhyme> Hope it's not a trailer rating, because EW is kinda rough
[1:50:17] <Sol_Install> that makes it far easier
[1:50:17] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt What is N/A for
[1:50:20] <@TheYellowcouch> Time to CRY
[1:50:20] <%Puhff> tell*
[1:50:23] <toyforus235> no auto attack
[1:50:25] <+SladeClegane> What is N/A for if not content you didn’t play?
[1:50:26] <%BoxNavy> i didnt even know until death unto dawn that patches got trailers.
[1:50:27] <BigYanno> In the bag WHERE IT BELONGS
[1:50:33] <%RealThiele> hi grandpa

[1:50:46] <+AnIrishPapaya> In the Bin
[1:50:51] <Archmortal> @boogaleeboo They actually did it quite well.  The problem is that it was such outdated design that everyone who'd ever heard of World of Warcraft and the changes it brought to the genre FUCKING HATED IT
[1:50:51] <%Frost_Quill> Oh yeah you had to keep your character facing the enemies or your attacks would miss.
[1:50:52] <%InternetShis> It's time for A N S W E R S

[1:52:24] <InXplotch> "Look, we're literally BLOWING UP THIS SHIT MMO"
[1:52:25] <Cosairen> that would be cheating
[1:52:25] <%tusk102> TO ALL OF MY CHILDREN
[1:52:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> ARR is one of the best trailers of all time. ARR itself is a high C or B
[1:52:27] <skullneedles> the coil version is not a trailer

[1:52:42] <+SergeEXE> OH LOOK IT'S THE SAME PARTY

[1:52:49] <RebelliousPawn> lilyhoLilyPls lilyhoLilyPls lilyhoLilyPls

[1:52:59] <+Anaguma_no_Koe> When I started my free trial and this booted up I immediately bought the game. no regrets after 1 and a half years
[1:53:01] <%BoxNavy> man the 50 artifact gear for war is great
[1:53:01] <AllenDeadman> yeah
[1:53:02] <sirtommygunn> It's still so crazy that all of FF14 we know now is a post-apocalypse story that people played through

[1:58:07] <+SergeEXE> I've still never done Behemoth
[1:58:08] <Sydin18> EVEN THE GREAT LOUISOIX WOULD MAKE A GOOD SUMMON:  The Mod
[1:58:08] <%DianaTheAscian> they need to redo Odin
[1:58:09] <%commanderapathy> papalymo was my favorite character
[1:58:12] <%Frost_Quill> I got an Odin battle a week ago.
[1:58:12] <Cosairen> we still get odin call outs on lamia
[1:58:12] <Warbot40> Odin needs a new trial
[1:58:14] <%Conzanagi> I got one a couple weeks ago

[1:58:17] <kulmoth> no kill though because it was at like 4am
[1:58:18] <+Deosier> i actually did odin not too long ago
[1:58:19] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt Behemoth was up a few days ago actually
[1:58:19] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Dude, I fought Odin ONCE in like, 6 years of playing this

[1:58:25] <atlasdotwav> What is that 4 legged monstrosity he is riding
[1:58:25] <%kainhighwind1990> Odin being optional is so weird to me
[1:58:26] <%Wallabri> behemoth is always dead immediately >:C
[1:58:27] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Fucking love those old fates
[1:58:28] <%W1nterTitan> THEM

[1:58:29] <funkerbuster> cant ever find the FATEs for those two
[1:58:29] <PhilanthropyG> ARR cast look like their lvl 5-6 in DnD 5E, vs now where they look lvl 15-16, and WoL @ 20
[1:58:29] <+starlorb3> TITTY
[1:58:30] <%d1stantutopia> I literally fought both Odin and Behemoth in the last 2 weeks
[1:58:32] <%TeepPhoenix> And G'raha is somewhere in that Crystal Tower picking his nose or something
[1:58:32] <%InternetShis> I did Odin a month ago
[1:58:32] <s__o__u__l_> that song oh shit
[1:58:33] <+Deosier> didn't kill sinc eit was like super early in the day
[1:58:34] <+TheCityBeast> I did Behemoth last week
[1:58:35] <%d1stantutopia> and Ixion TWICE, too
[1:58:35] <Viaquez> ive seen a few odins on ultros recently
[1:58:35] <zerointelligence000> Hey the 1.0 players got sent to a better game
[1:58:36] <+Count_Graagh> That tower probably won't be anything important
[1:58:36] <inksmears> i looove this song
[1:58:37] <%Agami23> so did the old man send them to the future?? or just away?
[1:58:37] <%BoxNavy> chjbDance
[1:58:39] <%tusk102> odin and behemoth last week
[1:58:39] <+SolGainer> @LastHazzerd did you not do the last quest of 5.5
[1:58:39] <+Greywyn00> last time I saw odin was when I fist started at 4.3
[1:58:39] <Ahack13> I still see Odins but I think I have only ever seen Behemoth like once and Ive played since hW
[1:58:40] <Darksword64> @LastHazzerd We did in 5.55 Final Duty
[1:58:42] <+RelikaNox> oh this music!
[1:58:42] <roobanguy> its still goofy to me that the canonical WoL is an isekai protaganist
[1:58:42] <%asgard147> limesAw

[2:08:22] <Ralfclogs> @Sunstalker LUL
[2:08:22] <%tomdwarf> I mean, for me, 2.1 is equal to 2.0. Both are boring.
[2:08:23] <%DianaTheAscian> WOOILE AT RISK
[2:08:23] <@TheYellowcouch> The goblet is for broke ass bitches!!
[2:08:23] <engineboi> I can hear Woolie cringing from here
[2:08:24] <dan_g_v> where's Wooolie when we need him?
[2:08:24] <%Sirakou> My house is in Goblet, still the worst place
[2:08:24] <Ultimatefool> What do you mean Pat, this patch was STACKED AF
[2:08:25] <funkerbuster> Goblet doesnt look that bad
[2:08:25] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> So, was housing as much of a shit show then like it is now?
[2:08:26] <%Eaglestrike117> Holy fuckin shit you didnt launch with the eternal housing crisis nightmare?
[2:08:26] <mortificent> Proletariat Goblet
[2:08:27] <+Anaguma_no_Koe> THE GOBLET IS FOR BROKE ASS BITCHES
[2:08:28] <+edmeow27> what housing! its still not a feature xD
[2:08:28] <ValkahRoctsteel> Go let is so nice

[2:08:41] <%BoxNavy> this section of the trailer is lies
[2:08:42] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> wow
[2:08:42] <+Spawnbroker> god yeeeesssss
[2:08:42] <gryffinp> I'm surprised that people are surprised that housing wasn't in at launch, housing seems like its obviously optional side content that you wouldn't prioritize dev time on
[2:08:44] <%RealThiele> fuck those crap tools
[2:08:44] <+miguelrod777> I used to have a house now  homeless
[2:08:44] <Srthunda> never seen this before

[2:08:50] <%RocketBarrel> better
[2:08:51] <28moogles> I dunno, this was hype as hell back in the day.
[2:08:51] <+NYCrownlessKing> ya

[2:08:54] <%skeletonmilk> audio is good
[2:08:54] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT THIS UNATTAINABLE DREAM
[2:08:54] <%SlackerAlex> little loud
[2:08:55] <Comb711> it's a little stinky
[2:08:55] <@StridentSong> Audio good
[2:08:56] <Sol_Install> better
[2:08:56] <@TheYellowcouch> that's my house!
[2:08:56] <+SladeClegane> What?!
[2:08:57] <toyforus235> If its so much easy
[2:08:57] <%Frost_Quill> One of the reasons I'm excited for Ishgard housing is the new APARTMENTS, I have ZERO hope of getting a house, but I'll probably finally be able to buy an apartment.
[2:08:58] <sirtommygunn> slightly high
[2:08:58] <@ssjklyco> audio patched in 2.1
[2:08:58] <+nikoloas_> I don't think this is actually in the game
[2:08:59] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> oooooooooo
[2:08:59] <%zepherl> the trailer is missing the part where you could buy an entire ward out
[2:08:59] <joeobo2> o7
[2:09:01] <Laecerelius> Music isn't warbling like the ARR trailer's
[2:09:01] <T_Sasquatch> Its so easy. Just buy a house 4Head

[2:09:06] <NRhyme> Wonder if I'll be able to build a house one day.
[2:09:07] <@TheYellowcouch> that rug really brings it all together
[2:09:07] <%MegadBlitz> how fast did these original housing go out of stock
[2:09:07] <EternalJedi> walls rooPog
[2:09:08] <%RonaldMcDownload> still can't afford a fuckin house
[2:09:08] <+Adalore> My FC has a "Housing crimes" channel for all of the designs that require intense glitch application to put up.

[2:12:00] <%TeepPhoenix> I spit upon Haukke,
[2:12:01] <%crimsonharvest> haukke is garbo in every state
[2:12:01] <+SergeEXE> catJAM
[2:12:01] <+Adalore> I managed to never do haukke manor until like a few months ago.
[2:12:01] <Ahack13> Forgot both of these existed
[2:12:02] <+doctor_brofessor> music is on point though
[2:12:02] <@StridentSong> GAMBA TIME

[2:12:05] <%CalderGaming> haukke hard final boss is such a weird difficulty spike
[2:12:06] <%afronooch> hell yeah gamba
[2:12:06] <+SiameseDuck> Haukke Manor sucks in general

[2:12:08] <dan_g_v> Who was the bird booba?
[2:12:09] <+DeRedBaron> almost pass out doing ARR stuff tbh
[2:12:09] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> they added so many dungeons in arr, think every arr patch added a handfull
[2:12:10] <+healnavi> man I'm sure noticing the utter lack of lighting from back in the day
[2:12:10] <+Adalore> Freaken HP check mechanics on that boss.
[2:12:13] <PhilanthropyG> ARR, when they were still figuring out dungeon gimmick complexity.
[2:12:14] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah it's really bad
[2:12:14] <28moogles> IMPORTANT! In 2.1 the Pharos music only played for a few seconds before the battle music replaced it.
[2:12:15] <MKII> FOCUS THE ADDS
[2:12:16] <+Adalore> You over burn it and you die
[2:12:16] <+SolGainer> goddamn Halicarnasus
[2:12:17] <funkerbuster> mAnor hard has terrible dps checks
[2:12:17] <AllenDeadman> ARRR dungeon design overall
[2:12:18] <BackflipCharm> Man I forgot how much of this content I skipped back in the day
[2:12:18] <+Complete_Phased> Was this ninja patch?
[2:12:19] <AllenDeadman> sucked
[2:12:19] <Trinity5> damn as bad as most of this content was, there's a shit ton here
[2:12:20] <UnduexKaGo> The amount of times people have died on the last boss bc of their mechanic.
[2:12:21] <Sydin18> Now we use the manor for freaking halloween
[2:12:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> uh
[2:12:22] <+cappyd33> hey use dps lb or you'll WIPE
[2:12:22] <%KineticZen> Nobody burns down the spawns, everyone dies, repeat
[2:12:24] <%CodyStruggles> Sounds like ARR dungeons. All suck
[2:12:24] <%BoxNavy> spriggans chjbBoClap
[2:12:24] <%crimsonharvest> Haukke Manor is the Wailing Caverns of ff14
[2:12:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> that final boss will annihilate your party if you try to murder it too fast
[2:12:25] <mr_plint> The music tho...
[2:12:26] <+Anaguma_no_Koe> nobody knows how to do the final boss on this one
[2:12:26] <Thenuclearwalrus> Those odds LUL
[2:12:28] <%LastHazzerd> Spriggins
[2:12:28] <NRhyme> I forgot this one exists
[2:12:29] <+invida> Haukke is cool. I miss non-linear dungeons
[2:12:29] <%PatNTheHat> THIS PIECE OF SHIT DUNGEON
[2:12:29] <%skeletonmilk> insane
[2:12:30] <%BoxNavy> ew why
[2:12:30] <+DontMindMee> golem bunny
[2:12:31] <%W1nterTitan> wat
[2:12:32] <$ONotation> That final Haukke Manor (Hard) boss.
[2:12:33] <%YharnamNighthawk> Fuck Copperbell
[2:12:33] <%JGardner03> Back in the day
[2:12:33] <gryffinp> yeah but they're repeats
[2:12:34] <+Greywyn00> and none of them were good
[2:12:34] <sirtommygunn> worst dungeon
[2:12:35] <tuesti> thats way they werent great
[2:12:35] <@SpaceCapnCrone> worst of the three right here
[2:12:35] <@TheYellowcouch> Thank god that changed
[2:12:36] <+healnavi> Yeah but they sucked
[2:12:37] <%commanderapathy> why tho?
[2:12:37] <%SlackerAlex> All these are terrible lol, especially now
[2:12:38] <+Kyma1020> Hope that comes back
[2:12:39] <%InternetShis> ew
[2:12:39] <kulmoth> they were compensating for the failure of 1.0
[2:12:39] <%d1stantutopia> The concept of Hard dungeons being a canon revisit at a later time is cool, but man some of them are hits and some are MISSES
[2:12:39] <funkerbuster> fucking second boss
[2:12:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> but they all sucked tho
[2:12:43] <Sydin18> Granted, it was reused dungeons
[2:12:43] <AllenDeadman> god damn
[2:12:45] <+ArticPath> I miss protect. Don't miss casting it
[2:12:46] <%Agami23> but with reused assets, that was easier
[2:12:47] <%DianaTheAscian> THATS CRAZY
[2:12:47] <badzombie28> UGGHHH
[2:12:48] <%tomdwarf> I mean, yeah these dungeons arent good. But are they any better than 2.0? No, not really.
[2:12:49] <Daxalog> I wish you could just do the hard version of an instance after you beat the normal version
[2:12:49] <Laecerelius> I hate BOTH Copperbells
[2:12:49] <+GingerSen> damn this is a long trailer
[2:12:49] <+Adalore> I dunno, the manor might be worse.
[2:12:49] <Thenuclearwalrus> Better than copperbell normal atleast
[2:12:50] <+Dwarven_Gaming> quantitiy over quality
[2:12:50] <%Monkeyweed21> and at least one of them kinda sucked
[2:12:50] <funkerbuster> the fire floor boss is nightmare
[2:12:52] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> dame
[2:12:54] <@TheYellowcouch> OMG
[2:12:54] <nevan_44> i did haukke manor hard for the first time the other day bc roulettes and we wiped like 10 times on the final boss LUL

[2:14:34] <%RealThiele> CHEMICALS GO YAAAY
[2:14:37] <heartlesshealer> you are drowned in the fervor felt for Titan
[2:14:38] <sirtommygunn> I wish Ifrit had a good theme

[2:14:43] <Laecerelius> He ate ALL OF THOSE
[2:14:43] <ItsJustShawn> dude eating mechanics
[2:14:43] <%kainhighwind1990> its so weird to me that Ifrit is always the first summon you see cause he looks so strong
[2:14:45] <sirtommygunn> Like Titan and Garuda get
[2:14:46] <zerointelligence000> that warrior got caught by everything
[2:14:46] <kulmoth> this dude ate all the charges and lived
[2:14:47] <%Nobrev> GOBLIN CHEESE
[2:14:47] <%Frost_Quill> I did the ORIGINAL MSQ before the trimmed it.

[2:14:56] <%isolex_> UwU
[2:14:56] <%kainhighwind1990> and you'd expect someone that cool looking to be a later game thing
[2:14:57] <MHRegent> UWU
[2:14:57] <Thenuclearwalrus> I started in Stormblood cant wait to get to the 4.2 trailer
[2:14:57] <%YharnamNighthawk> SUCH DEVASATION
[2:14:58] <MKII> Square needs to give them the money for an ARR Remake it still needs it
[2:14:59] <@TheYellowcouch> Yeaaa I soloed this dude in like 20 seconds
[2:15:01] <%TeepPhoenix> Is this the first Refrain battle?
[2:15:01] <%Monkeyweed21> 2.X was WAY better when it was current and you did it leading up to Heavensward
[2:15:02] <NRhyme> WHY DOES ULTIMA HAS SUCH SMALL HANDS
[2:15:02] <%UvBenServed> MINSTREL
[2:15:03] <+cappyd33> oh yeah this first minstrels
[2:15:03] <+natjen8> 4 EXTREMES IN 1 PATCH
[2:15:04] <+stephane3012> 4 ex
[2:15:04] <%KineticZen> No, EX
[2:15:04] <Sol_Install> UWU
[2:15:04] <+Adalore> Like there was a lot of important MSQ story beats, but the pacing was gaaarrrbaaage
[2:15:04] <sirtommygunn> Ballad of ultima
[2:15:06] <+teebos> wait what?
[2:15:06] <+TheWiggly> oh Ultima EX also was this patch?
[2:15:06] <Cosairen> i remember getting this in mentor roulette once
[2:15:07] <Augus7717> god damn there is so much in the patch
[2:15:07] <FMsava> SO MUCH CONTENT
[2:15:10] <Trinity5> ULTIMA WEAPON EX WAS 2.1???
[2:15:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Ballad: Ultima is still pretty legit
[2:15:11] <danraven> this is a meaty patch
[2:15:12] <%Faustgesicht> I wish this exteme had a mount
[2:15:13] <%croxeye> (and i really liked the political storylines for the ARR post patches)
[2:15:14] <+DoctorDerp388> Ultima extreme rocked my cock
[2:15:15] <+NeonLight> Oh man I remember old Ultima Ex kicking our asses
[2:15:15] <tuesti> you KNOW they devs DID NOT sleep
[2:15:15] <vVAstrAVv> lol the ifrit guy missed every mechanic
[2:15:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> This seems like a massive improvement over the old shit
[2:15:17] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Bard's Ballad
[2:15:17] <%RonaldMcDownload> still havent done this one
[2:15:18] <s__o__u__l_> NotLikeThis why the FUCK dont they just call it Ultima Weapon Extreme??
[2:15:18] <majindusto> ULTIMA  WEAPON enigmaPOG
[2:15:19] <%MrBorisMakarov> NOT UWU CHAT
[2:15:20] <PhilanthropyG> an alliance, 3 dungeons, 4 EX fights, new Trial fight...
[2:15:20] <%HotSauceFiend> this looks like a ff13-2 boss
[2:15:21] <%AJ_Cherenkov> ah yes, the famed UWU
[2:15:21] <funkerbuster> EZ extreme here
[2:15:21] <%Jamejarrs> Seeing everyone take those AoEs makes me so angry
[2:15:22] <BackflipCharm> 2.1 was the endgame patch
[2:15:23] <dante_9x> 4 damn
[2:15:25] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I've still never done Ultima's Bane
[2:15:25] <%PMAvers> Eh, the MSQ wasn't that bad if you were doing it patch to patch.
[2:15:27] <+Greywyn00> they NEEDED this game to keep doing well
[2:15:27] <MazDoThing> Yoooo, that fight looks sick tho
[2:15:28] <+Adalore> there is a reason why they give intense amounts of echo now.
[2:15:29] <+GallowsDrop> I think I lost my channel points

[2:20:16] <ElSuperNova> Big chaos energy\
[2:20:17] <%SolumFuturae> worst one
[2:20:17] <%MaritimeFox> It's not good
[2:20:18] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> All for Cheese
[2:20:18] <%Crimpson> It was one of the fastest dungeons to clear back then
[2:20:18] <Nurdock> Fast at least!
[2:20:19] <%TeepPhoenix> This one is a good one to solo
[2:20:19] <UberWolfman> THE BEST DUNGEON Kappa
[2:20:19] <+Adalore> ITS ALL CHEESE

[2:20:21] <%Faustgesicht> War for CHEEESE
[2:20:21] <%LastHazzerd> is it Diablos who's the dark boss in FF:Explorers?
[2:20:21] <+starlorb3> Brayflox is what you spammed to get Anima weapons
[2:20:21] <@TheYellowcouch> But it's great for getting the HW relic when solo
[2:20:22] <+NeonLight> CHOESE
[2:20:22] <%BoxNavy> also good for solo anima farming
[2:20:22] <+Dwarven_Gaming> FINAL BOSS THO
[2:20:22] <NRhyme> MUH CHEESE
[2:20:22] <+TheCityBeast> Dick cheese dungeon (Hard)
[2:20:22] <AdmiralButtloaf> in a fun way lol
[2:20:22] <SummonerMagno> this dungeon gave me my anima weapon
[2:20:23] <Thenuclearwalrus> WRONG
[2:20:23] <+SladeClegane> 🧀
[2:20:24] <skullneedles> it's where we met the illuminati though
[2:20:25] <+SolGainer> THE MOST EXPLOITABLE DUNGEON IN THE GAME
[2:20:26] <%Frost_Quill> I ran this solo like 80 times for my HW relic weapon.
[2:20:26] <Ultimatefool> Don't care, speedrunning for Poetics anyway
[2:20:27] <+starlorb3> it was a 3 minute rune
[2:20:27] <Thenuclearwalrus> OBJECTIVELY WRONG
[2:20:27] <+Uttrik> BUTCHER'S BLOCK D:
[2:20:27] <%Valdorick> GET CHEESE
[2:20:28] <%crimsonharvest> normal brayflox sucks too
[2:20:29] <%PatNTheHat> If the final boss could HOLD STILL FOR 2 SECONDS
[2:20:29] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> big cheese tho
[2:20:31] <+Nomenanza> best dungeon to farm for anima light solo tho
[2:20:32] <%TeepPhoenix> When you're getting light for your Relic weapon
[2:20:33] <%kainhighwind1990> THE ILLUMINATI WANTS CHEESE
[2:20:33] <%SwdVengeance> Goblins like cheese
[2:20:33] <+cappyd33> hey relic weapons
[2:20:34] <Archmortal> BUT THE FIRST MINION THAT GOES ON YOUR SHOULDER
[2:20:34] <%Wallabri> i did this a BUNCH for ANIMA...........
[2:20:34] <%UvBenServed> Stinky Cheese (Hard)
[2:20:35] <+starlorb3> ITS GOOD FOR ANIMA WEAPON QUESTS
[2:20:35] <%silentblast93> what patch was hod?
[2:20:36] <amritadyne> how can one man be so wrong?
[2:20:36] <BigYanno> Brayflox's Longstop sounds like a Sex position
[2:20:36] <+SergeEXE> RELICS
[2:20:37] <%Crimpson> It was like 3 bosses  that could be cleared in like 6 mins
[2:20:37] <@TheYellowcouch> Final boss is the worst
[2:20:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> but Illuminati time
[2:20:38] <+Adalore> I only like it for goblin faction meme setup
[2:20:38] <%MaritimeFox> Also, goblins at their worst
[2:20:39] <sirtommygunn> The hard version is worse than the regular? damn
[2:20:39] <AllenDeadman> FUCK
[2:20:40] <%croxeye> isnt that the one you used to pull up to the first boss then quit out??

[2:20:42] <AllenDeadman> TAKE IT AWAY
[2:20:42] <fimbulvetr27> This dungeon ruined the game so much because of how you got tomes back in the day
[2:20:43] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I've never done Brayflox HARd
[2:20:43] <calboku> this one also sucks
[2:20:43] <%isolex_> psaWhat who the fuck thought brayflox hard was a good idea

[2:23:00] <%BoxNavy> nael was a pain to solo with rdm moon2W
[2:23:00] <+stabethadeathwhisperdraws> The final tier of the second coil has one of the worst bosses
[2:23:01] <gryffinp> I kinda like the twintania fight

[2:23:12] <Bonebagmel> I can say "but the music tho" to anything right?
[2:23:13] <%silentblast93> i had to beg my fc to run this so i can get the story
[2:23:13] <28moogles> Coil 1 was great. More interesting design.
[2:23:14] <Maverick2736> I'm new to FFXIV, but I'm aiming for that bomb palanquin as soon as I'm level for it
[2:23:14] <CritScratch> they improved on raids later on

[2:23:19] <sirtommygunn> Will Coil be soloable at level cap?
[2:23:21] <stealthfart> No one is ever available for them. I was lucky to get people to help me
[2:23:21] <@ssjklyco> no
[2:23:23] <+NeonLight> Remember when Ninja stealth was a REQUIREMENT?!
[2:23:23] <%croxeye> even learning all of the markers was fun
[2:23:23] <%chiazam> I can't find anyone to do them with me
[2:23:24] <$EsotericOdyssey> or, at least, a DRK of my skill level
[2:23:25] <%Tarage> STUBBLE

[2:32:09] <%Frost_Quill> How'd they change it?
[2:32:09] <+Greywyn00> syrcus tower isn't as good the 500th time
[2:32:09] <+miguelrod777> hey yo the twinning Kappa
[2:32:11] <Kain5707> AngelThump
[2:32:11] <%shurtal> you fight legally distinct Sabin in the end
[2:32:11] <%d1stantutopia> Syrcus Tower rules
[2:32:12] <+Akizea> the best theme of the 3
[2:32:12] <kyuubisonic> its rad
[2:32:12] <+Cykaima> UNSHAKEABLE
[2:32:15] <%Frost_Quill> What's different?
[2:32:16] <Augus7717> it was a blast
[2:32:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> The best of those three tbh
[2:32:18] <cassiusbright1157> Syrcus Tower was really fun the first 200 times I did it
[2:32:20] <+lojack69> this is the worst patch so far, definitely bottom of D
[2:32:21] <%PatNTheHat> !! Danger Bongoes Everyone Run !!
[2:32:21] <sirtommygunn> wait only the first part of the raid was released before?? wow damn
[2:32:21] <AdmiralButtloaf> look at the tits on that dog creature lol
[2:32:22] <%AJ_Cherenkov> that looks like twinning, come to think of it
[2:32:22] <TimesApex> when you had to actually play the game
[2:32:23] <Thenuclearwalrus> Syrcus tower is cool the first time, boring the 100th time
[2:32:23] <Warbot40> I'm sooooooooo sick of syrcus
[2:32:24] <%Tarage> Why did they change it?
[2:32:24] <%Felhad> I never noticed he has dog heads...
[2:32:24] <CritScratch> our boy lived here
[2:32:25] <+Fidranth> rememeber when glasya had mechanics
[2:32:25] <+Reddhero12> you won't skip sstuff in endwalker anymore @PatStaresAt
[2:32:26] <%crimsonharvest> i love the gold-on-aquamarine scheme
[2:32:26] <%kyh9> God these patches were huge
[2:32:26] <%snugglepuggs> No you don’t Pat
[2:32:28] <%TeepPhoenix> You got all those assinine glams from that one like the Scylla hat
[2:32:28] <MKII> I still havent seen the platforms mechanic
[2:32:30] <%Monkeyweed21> back whrn mechanics mattered
[2:32:31] <+Reddhero12> you won't skip sstuff in endwalker anymore @PatStaresAt they're changing the way the ilvl works
[2:32:32] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt This questline was dope too
[2:32:33] <Laecerelius> You murder too hard nowadays
[2:32:34] <Archmortal> Syrcus Tower was MUCH better than Labyrinth and had WAY LAMER GEAR
[2:32:34] <%Frost_Quill> Oh.
[2:32:36] <$StrawberryPantsu> And that's a good thing
[2:32:37] <+Adalore> they got the structure for raids sorta figured out with this one onwards.
[2:32:38] <+GingerSen> wonder if the squish will fix that
[2:32:39] <$ONotation> We might see old Syrcus Tower again with the stat squish
[2:32:41] <%TeepPhoenix> And AMON'S HAT
[2:32:42] <+wizard_of_diamonds> THAT HAT
[2:32:43] <%Valdorick> You ever wonder what the jumping platforms in the third bosses room are used for? ME TOO
[2:32:43] <WakeUpThrow> I wonder if the stat squish will help. I really hope it does
[2:32:43] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> most of the mechanics now are skipped
[2:32:45] <+GingerSen> Asura!
[2:32:46] <%chiazam> Gr'aha Tia is my man
[2:32:47] <NRhyme> UGLY BOI
[2:32:48] <%Tarage> What if the skill shrink makes them happen again?
[2:32:48] <$EsotericOdyssey> do you think the Ilevel squish might help Syrcus? @PatStaresAt
[2:32:48] <@TheYellowcouch> It's like how Gaius's signature move no one gets to see anymore
[2:32:52] <%kyh9> FF3 BROD
[2:32:53] <mario_Sif> people don't even see Cloud of darkness final 2 moves anymore with its poison thunder hands anymore
[2:32:54] <T_Sasquatch> What a unique location
[2:32:54] <%shurtal> Yeah it is
[2:32:55] <%kyh9> FF3 CHADS
[2:32:55] <dan_g_v> very cool spot

[2:32:56] <NRhyme> LOVE HIS PANTS THOUGH
[2:32:57] <%MaritimeFox> Yeah, this raid gets stomped quickly
[2:32:58] <freefa> mariaSmug
[2:32:58] <fimbulvetr27> You skip all of their mechanics. I've never seen the jump pads on the 2nd boss since HW
[2:32:58] <%LastHazzerd> i love this whole plot tho, FF3 is good
[2:32:58] <%PMAvers> Too bad there isn't a roulette that's like Forced Min iLevel
[2:33:01] <%UvBenServed> Hmmmm
[2:33:01] <%TeepPhoenix> He looks like a Pillar Man
[2:33:01] <PhilanthropyG> This games version of the Millenium Tower
[2:33:01] <Comb711> I was so bummed, I looked at the boss arena with all the jump pads, and then the dude just exploded
[2:33:03] <$ringabal> Gee, I bet this place won't be so important
[2:33:04] <%Birdigalore> Xande's aklright
[2:33:05] <+lojack69> a location so nice they used it twice
[2:33:09] <%JohnAtDawn> Do you think Graha was the one to take out the throne?
[2:33:09] <@StridentSong> That Throne Gem got me started on my marketing bullshit
[2:33:11] <joeobo2> :)
[2:33:11] <%BoxNavy> cut the song right before the twinning part moon2W
[2:33:11] <%d1stantutopia> @TheYellowcouch Gaius has a SIGNATURE MOVE!?

[2:34:32] <olwe123> evil pope?
[2:34:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> -Dancing mad starts playing-
[2:34:33] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> C-
[2:34:33] <Midboss87> sloppy~
[2:34:35] <TimesApex> DoE is a nice title to wear in game tho
[2:34:35] <MayShip> ARR sounds like it's going on for awhile
[2:34:36] <%MaritimeFox> He did say he needed to be harsh
[2:34:36] <tuesti> LUL
[2:34:36] <+doctor_brofessor> 1.0 could be F-
[2:34:36] <+Adalore> Alph fucking up with the crystal braves was an important character beat, but dense smol boi
[2:34:36] <%BoxNavy> you might as well rename F to 1.0
[2:34:37] <heartlesshealer> hmmmm
[2:34:38] <theworsttimelime> Tam Tara Tara Hard :(
[2:34:38] <+Aheg0d> F+
[2:34:38] <+healnavi> F
[2:34:40] <%AJ_Cherenkov> it can still live here
[2:34:40] <+Wolfstriker121> what about nightmare tier
[2:34:41] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> F
[2:34:41] <Laecerelius> MAKE A NEW TIER THAT'S JUST 1.0 TIER
[2:34:41] <+Greywyn00> F is for 1.0 and 1.0 alone
[2:34:41] <+FlamingoJazz> Bottom of D is F
[2:34:42] <%codedoomboy> D
[2:34:43] <CritScratch> so bad we had to reboot
[2:34:43] <%snugglepuggs> Deez nutz
[2:34:44] <@ssjklyco> make an E
[2:34:44] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> SLOPPPPEY
[2:34:44] <%kysath> So what is N/A? @PatStaresAt
[2:34:46] <@TheYellowcouch> There is a fucking ocean between D and F
[2:34:47] <+healnavi> MAKE A NEW TIER
[2:34:51] <gryffinp> wondering what N/A will contain
[2:34:51] <Therusher> 1.0 needs its own special sub-F tier IMO
[2:34:52] <+FlamingoJazz> What's below F!??!?!
[2:34:52] <skullneedles> F almost killed squenix
[2:34:53] <+SladeClegane> 1.0 should be n/a mister didn’t play it
[2:34:53] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> F-
[2:34:54] <AdmiralButtloaf> its playable at least
[2:34:55] <+stephane3012> what's under that
[2:34:56] <%d1stantutopia> SO PUT IT IN F BUT ABOVE 1.0
[2:34:57] <NRhyme> Make a 1.0 tier for 1.0
[2:34:57] <Ralfclogs> F+
[2:34:58] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> 1.0 is f only, its only uphill from now
[2:34:58] <BigYanno> F is "they made a documentary about how bad this was"
[2:34:58] <kyuubisonic> 2.4 was where we got ninja right?
[2:34:59] <tuesti> just put Shadowbringers in S to save time
[2:34:59] <Archmortal> I kind of hate that the WEAPON story in 5.x manages to be even dumber than the Crystal Braves
[2:34:59] <%silentblast93> pat f is too high for 1.0
[2:35:02] <%Bane_Kaikyo> 4.1?
[2:35:03] <@StridentSong> Yea make a new tier if you're going to block out F
[2:35:04] <+zerokingkh3> A

[2:38:47] <sirtommygunn> its fine
[2:38:47] <%Frost_Quill> That coat every femroe uses.
[2:38:47] <@TheYellowcouch> This boss is the low point
[2:38:47] <%Gasgrave> music is great for it though
[2:38:47] <+MarkoTolstov> this music just drones on and on and i hate it
[2:38:47] <gryffinp> that fucking yeti boss
[2:38:47] <+starlorb3> snow cloak is pretty meh
[2:38:48] <wqorst> DKC music
[2:38:48] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> i like the music

[2:38:53] <theworsttimelime> the last boss is kinda cool tho
[2:38:53] <BaeSoora> the music for this is amazing
[2:38:54] <Archmortal> Snowcloak is great
[2:38:54] <bahiti> just had the patch fail to download after downloading 1.3GB twice on a limited data connection, probably due to win10 automatically setting a data cap without asking.  sure helped me save data by making me download the same 1.3GB three times! feels good man
[2:38:54] <%AJ_Cherenkov> weirdly chill
[2:38:55] <+Nomenanza> Snowcloak gave us Fenrir tho
[2:38:55] <%MaritimeFox> How is this dungeon music of all things?
[2:38:55] <+DontMindMee> SourPls
[2:38:55] <haisho> oh right the dungeon where EVERYONE forgets the mechanics
[2:38:55] <BaeSoora> the dungeon is ass
[2:38:56] <Trinity5> GOOBBUE
[2:38:58] <Comb711> You stay in that one room in the middle for way too long
[2:38:58] <Sydin18> I dont mind Snowcloak, but the music puts me to sleep X_X
[2:38:58] <%nanaki_ff14> This was the patch to bring me back to 14
[2:38:59] <LordDudeTheFirst> This song makes me want to sleep
[2:38:59] <%RonaldMcDownload> nobody fucking learns the yeti boss
[2:38:59] <Viaquez> snowcloak is a vibe and a half
[2:38:59] <%chiazam> It's alright
[2:39:00] <%LastHazzerd> i liked the snowball fight with the yeti
[2:39:01] <%Agami23> snowcloak is where i learned what a bad tank is
[2:39:02] <count_bob> weird snowballs
[2:39:03] <%MegadBlitz> yeti sure is fun when your dps kills the sprig
[2:39:04] <PurplePlantPlatinum> but fenrir tho
[2:39:05] <%BoxNavy> hey its that mount
[2:39:07] <+starlorb3> fenrir was a good boss tho
[2:39:08] <@TheYellowcouch> Fenrir is dope
[2:39:08] <%Tarage> Puppy
[2:39:09] <%BioHunter> oh god he has protect on him
[2:39:09] <$ringabal> Fenrir was alright
[2:39:10] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> @NeonLight it came in HW
[2:39:10] <%LastHazzerd> yey FEN!
[2:39:10] <+VoltecZero> They wasted Fenrir on this
[2:39:10] <%zepherl> old AOEs look weird
[2:39:13] <+Kyma1020> Fenrir's dope
[2:39:13] <@TheYellowcouch> Lunar cry
[2:39:13] <zerointelligence000> go behind the pillar you fucks
[2:39:14] <%d1stantutopia> No one does the yeti boss right and it takes forever
[2:39:15] <%TeepPhoenix> Fenrir is pretty cool tho
[2:39:15] <T_Sasquatch> @catoclystic its an arr msq dungeon
[2:39:15] <cassiusbright1157> Yeti makes me hate myself everytime I get Snowcloak in DF and I'm not tanking. Seems no DF tanks know what to do there.
[2:39:15] <gryffinp> I actually like the wolf boss
[2:39:16] <+MarkoTolstov> FENRIR
[2:39:18] <+teebos> reminds me of the snow area in twilight princess
[2:39:18] <+Ghazarban> The zadnor dude :v
[2:39:18] <BreakfastSampler> awoo
[2:39:19] <AlexDaGr8> good ol' "stop killing the spriggans PLEASE"
[2:39:20] <UnduexKaGo> Snowcloak is fine so long as people actually do the snowball thing on the 2nd boss correctly
[2:39:21] <+StelEdelweiss> Did they split the patch download? PC was really small.

[2:54:59] <%Dr_DangerPhD> psaRaffle psaRaffle psaRaffle
[2:55:00] <%LastHazzerd> remember that Kaiji teaches us gambling addiction is bad
[2:55:02] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> this needs a new tier
[2:55:02] <+projectmanatees> Should of just told him channel points Is like salty bet
[2:55:06] <%Fidranth> Feed the Orb.
[2:55:13] <gryffinp> broke: doing things so that the streamer will notice you. woke: spending resources to be obnoxious while the streamer is on the toilet
[2:55:13] <Frostydough1> Imagine pat puts channel points rewards after everyone spends theirs LUL
[2:55:15] <%TeepPhoenix> We're doing this to crush the balls of the person who wrecked the stream to gamble on points
[2:55:19] <%MelBrooksKA> The fuck is going on
[2:55:21] <%Felhad> That makes sense
[2:55:21] <%BioHunter> thats cause not many use the points anyway
[2:55:21] <%KineticZen> I am going to create and sell one NFT for every 100 channel points I have, trillionaire by Saturday
[2:55:24] <%RealThiele> we can still tell him and i think slaty bet works great here to explain
[2:55:29] <T_Sasquatch> I have 140k points LUL
[2:55:29] <sirtommygunn> This patch is gonna take 4 hours to download and I have work in the morning, dang
[2:55:33] <Cosairen> we must all ponder the orb mans existence in his absence

[2:56:07] <peyodogo> @Wolfstriker121 listen pissing is a long arduous ritual
[2:56:07] <+NiktenKing> Points are now banned. Have a bad day.
[2:56:11] <%Monkeyweed21> I wish a big strong man would bend me over the table and tell me about the sensational MMO FFXIV with a free trial up to lvl 60 including the critically acclaimed Heavensward expansion
[2:56:12] <zerointelligence000> I should be studying but fuck it I need to waste points
[2:56:14] <%RealThiele> he did raise this to 20k for awhile last time this got out of hand
[2:56:16] <sirrice77> @NRhyme As you watch a channel you accumulate points, you can spend these points on various things like getting your message highlighted or getting emotes, you can also bet these points by predicting outcomes and win points if correct

[3:05:51] <%Wulfphelz> 4.4*
[3:05:51] <%d1stantutopia> Ah yes, the ultimate vibe check; you either clear it no issue or wipe 10 times at Angry Milkshake
[3:05:52] <%Frost_Quill> No one has to learn mechanics until then now.
[3:05:53] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Because of all the braindead poeople wanting to be carried through it

[3:05:59] <CyborgAV> YEAH SAME
[3:05:59] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[3:06:00] <Warbot40> The game doesn't prep people for it at all
[3:06:00] <$radiocabel> are you an Adds guy, a Belly guy, or Chains
[3:06:00] <parkslady> that's bc the sprouts are more sprouty
[3:06:00] <Cosairen> yeah its a shitshow now
[3:06:01] <@QueequegTheater> Thanks WoW players Kappa
[3:06:03] <@TheYellowcouch> even back in the beginning of SHB it was okay to run
[3:06:04] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> it was easier back then cause it wasnt needed for story
[3:06:04] <$EsotericOdyssey> I've consistently gotten decent groups in roulette that can get through Angra Mainyu
[3:06:04] <haisho> WoD was rough when I came back because I forgot EVERYTHING
[3:06:05] <lindadeann> Why
[3:06:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> yeah,,,
[3:06:05] <Baljhet> I need to check this raid's mechanics.
[3:06:05] <%KineticZen> Yeah you totally need an entire group to kill wolfsbane, gimme a break
[3:06:05] <nevan_44> YUP

[3:06:16] <%Monkeyweed21> WoD was great when people actually put in effort
[3:06:16] <Archmortal> I sat in literal fucking 12 hour queues to farm this set after people stopped doing it
[3:06:16] <+keiji_maede> @PatStaresAt  How pat?! How?!
[3:06:16] <%Wulfphelz> (A)dds (B)elly (C)hains
[3:06:17] <%UvBenServed> YEAH VORE BOSS
[3:06:18] <%MegadBlitz> i like world of darkness i dont find a lot of wipes when i do them
[3:06:19] <sirtommygunn> It's a raid of all gimmick bosses
[3:06:19] <theworsttimelime> the fights were really fun tho
[3:06:19] <%Valdorick> Hot Take - World of Darkness is awful... Because the bosses stop the zone music.
[3:06:21] <+trifecta89> doggo fun
[3:06:23] <%Agami23> people refuse to get vored by that dog
[3:06:23] <%BoxNavy> i love cerb when the group knows whats up
[3:06:23] <sirtommygunn> you either know your shit or you dont
[3:06:28] <%JohnAtDawn> YEP
[3:06:30] <lindadeann> They made it harder?
[3:06:30] <+doctor_brofessor> I know I run into issues with cerb sometimes, I pretty much always go belly even if im not in the right group to make sure it gets done
[3:06:33] <%LastHazzerd> there she is
[3:06:33] <%Agami23> yeah, the void quests kinda hint at that huh?
[3:06:34] <@TheYellowcouch> but for real world of darkness
[3:06:34] <%marusux> Nah every time I run it back in the day, trollers try to get us killed
[3:06:34] <%zepherl> idk how many times I've had 3 tanks fight for aggro and kill us with eyeball lasers
[3:06:34] <%RealThiele> BOOBA
[3:06:36] <envinyon> I only do this as tank so people don't fuck up angra mainyu
[3:06:36] <parkslady> that'd be fun
[3:06:37] <majindusto> CLOUD OF DARKNESS
[3:06:37] <%TeepPhoenix> I like the Eden version of Cloud of Darkness better
[3:06:38] <+SolGainer> oh definitely
[3:06:39] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> the 13th will definitely be a theme of some expac at some point
[3:06:39] <+FinetiSonata> most alliance raids are rough now for no reason?
[3:06:39] <%Bailey__Gaming> Big Succ
[3:06:39] <Latija> i wouldn't be surprised if its a dungeon in 6.0
[3:06:40] <zerointelligence000> WoD would be a cool zone
[3:06:40] <Aeroallways> Cerberus is where I find people have trouble
[3:06:40] <+nial_evol> FFXIV Shadowlands
[3:06:41] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> the 13th needs fixin
[3:06:42] <%UvBenServed> Probably
[3:06:43] <%RealThiele> ryne and gaia and the other 2
[3:06:43] <Archmortal> we can't NOT go to the 13th
[3:06:43] <%KineticZen> Then everybody runs to the left of Cloud even though she doesn't do a beam utnil she moves
[3:06:44] <Warbot40> Restoring the 13th you mean?
[3:06:44] <+MoonObscure> YESSSS
[3:06:46] <TheTakkster> The whole 13th is a loose end
[3:06:47] <%LastHazzerd> FFIII was great
[3:06:47] <theworsttimelime> FUCK STEPS OF FAITH
[3:06:49] <%chiazam> It's was perfectly fine for me

[3:07:58] <@TheYellowcouch> Very true
[3:07:58] <%snugglepuggs> Trailer sound drank from the calice
[3:07:59] <sirtommygunn> Steps of Faith though
[3:08:00] <NRhyme> It should've cut out before I heard English Papalymo
[3:08:00] <+bluescreen1988> same
[3:08:01] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> same
[3:08:01] <ArthurDoyleRPG> This party’s getting crazy doodOK
[3:08:01] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> let gooo
[3:08:01] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt My personal crazy theory is that Emet is alive and untempered in the lifestream and will take over sorting the souls of the dead from Hydaelyn. What's your personal craziest theory
[3:08:02] <%tomdwarf> A Tier, S is okay
[3:08:03] <WakeUpThrow> I could see it being the tippity top of A
[3:08:03] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:08:03] <@TheYellowcouch> it needs to be shown that respect
[3:08:05] <MarylandJutsu> you weren't always crazy....in general?
[3:08:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> A because of steps of faith drop it @patstaresat
[3:08:06] <$StephanieSadGirl> If the sound goes out, Pat should get Paige to come and make the sound effects for it
[3:08:06] <thebugwitch> YES EXACTLY
[3:08:07] <@TheYellowcouch> COWARD
[3:08:07] <%nanaki_ff14> All that content
[3:08:07] <lindadeann> Retry it ?
[3:08:08] <toyforus235> r/crytalbraves is banned
[3:08:08] <MidnightPacif1c> Jebaited
[3:08:09] <$ringabal> THIS PARTY'S GETTING CUHRAZEE
[3:08:09] <theworsttimelime> Gold Saucer gives it a HUGE plus
[3:08:09] <%TeepPhoenix> I think this patch is where I jumped on, right before HW started
[3:08:09] <MHRegent> LUL
[3:08:10] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> samme
[3:08:10] <+koujakward> S FOR TRIPLE TRIAD
[3:08:11] <%Valdorick> Before the Fall is where having Heavensward in the Freetrial starts to make sense.
[3:08:12] <Warbot40> Fair enough
[3:08:15] <%asgard147> okay, that's fine
[3:08:15] <mastertwin2> S is reserved for 5.3
[3:08:16] <%DianaTheAscian> fuck that trial
[3:08:16] <%LastHazzerd> if only it didn't take so damn long to get there
[3:08:16] <cassiusbright1157> There's a reason people say you either quit in ARR or you become a walking advertising for the game
[3:08:17] <%Monkeyweed21> COWARD
[3:08:18] <mortificent> YEYEYEYE
[3:08:18] <BreakfastSampler> I went from "tolerating" to "ok I'm in"
[3:08:19] <+NiktenKing> "Not an S"
[3:08:22] <Archmortal> no it's an S
[3:08:24] <Laecerelius> TOP 5 IN S THO
[3:08:24] <%UvBenServed> Fair
[3:08:24] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> why dont you stream ffxiv more often then
[3:08:25] <%SlackerAlex> Before the fall is the entire reason I tell people ARR was worth it
[3:08:25] <+healnavi> T R I P L E T R I A D
[3:08:25] <%RealThiele> A.S
[3:08:28] <lindadeann> It was just the sound right
[3:08:28] <Sol_Install> HAHAHAHAHA
[3:08:30] <mikesapartment> so?
[3:08:30] <theworsttimelime> you can alwasy decide later if you chnage your mind
[3:08:31] <+Katmon27> bttom of S?
[3:08:32] <%croxeye> fair enough, still one of the best tho
[3:08:32] <%SveriSageAdvice> i literally went back to listen to ALL the old podcasts, you talked so much about FFXIV back then that everyone would groan lol
[3:08:33] <+goldexp123> 4 s's
[3:08:33] <$EsotericOdyssey> well it's the first A
[3:08:33] <%CzeekyTV> that's fine, put all S tier if you want
[3:08:34] <$EsotericOdyssey> at least
[3:08:35] <%d1stantutopia> 3.0, 3.3, 5.0 and 5.3?
[3:08:35] <Durahand> have 5 then
[3:08:35] <T_Sasquatch> You said 5 earlier LUL
[3:08:35] <wretchedautomaton> if you know what you like then you know what you like
[3:08:36] <%RealThiele> SS
[3:08:36] <%BioHunter> its S
[3:08:39] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> its the patch i believe hooked people into 14
[3:08:41] <%SlackerAlex> You can change your mind Pat
[3:08:41] <28moogles> It would have been S when it came out but it's outclassed now.
[3:08:43] <%TeepPhoenix> Don't apologize for anything, push forward
[3:08:45] <+crossfire14> the patch update for endwalker is up. sorry if its already been said in chat
[3:08:46] <NRhyme> Bottom of S is A
[3:08:46] <CruxAustralis> have 5 then
[3:08:47] <@QueequegTheater> Make another tier
[3:08:47] <KenzBurp> let the man have his opinions
[3:08:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat are you negging the best part of ARR
[3:08:49] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Bottom of S is just A my dudes
[3:08:50] <CruxAustralis> SS let's go
[3:08:51] <peyodogo> you could always put it at the end of s
[3:08:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> top of A
[3:08:52] <%nanaki_ff14> 5 is a prime # tho
[3:08:52] <%ThreeEightySix> GYI: the 2nd part of the patch is now available for download
[3:08:52] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Solareon_) (warning)
[3:08:53] <lindadeann> Predetermined?

[3:09:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> 3.0 yayayayayay
[3:09:21] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah it's 3.3
[3:09:21] <cassiusbright1157> ARR was good, but Heavensward is when they really had the chance to polish stuff well.
[3:09:23] <%shurtal> ARR still had the worse VAs
[3:09:23] <gryffinp> do it, put 5.3 there
[3:09:24] <Comb711> Heavensward is fucking immaculate
[3:09:24] <%Frost_Quill> at the time it'd be S but not now
[3:09:25] <%LastHazzerd> FFXIV has some of the best content in Final Fantasy
[3:09:27] <+GingerSen> Heavensward just was them getting a good grasp of what works
[3:09:28] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I was replaying through it on an alt and there are so many low AND highs instead of just highs
[3:09:28] <%TeepPhoenix> Show us 5.3 please
[3:09:29] <Cosairen> pat thats not fair 5.3 is the best in the game
[3:09:29] <%BoxNavy> you might as well put it there now lol
[3:09:30] <%chiazam> goated trailer
[3:09:31] <%RealThiele> forever

[3:21:44] <%Frost_Quill> @kainhighwind1990 Warrior of Darkness reveal.
[3:21:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Don't forget Gordias being such a terrible raid that it almost killed the game forever
[3:21:45] <Tracazoid> Hearing about Heavensward was why I got into the game around then, did not disappoint

[3:22:12] <+TheCityBeast> Who else thought it was HeavenSWORD?
[3:22:12] <%UvBenServed> Remember when not all mounts could fly?
[3:22:12] <sirtommygunn> No flight in original zones for many more patches after too
[3:22:13] <+SolGainer> Also not all mounts could fly LUL

[3:22:16] <%Monkeyweed21> REMEMBER NEVERREAP
[3:22:17] <+SladeClegane> To strive ever Heavensward
[3:22:17] <gryffinp> Consider also that the Heavensward plot makes a big deal about the black chocobos
[3:22:18] <+Greywyn00> HW is when the game went from good to Great
[3:22:18] <%Wulfphelz> Having to build everything back up while dealing with a war between countries was so dope!
[3:22:20] <Macallai> Just in case anyone is out of the loop, you can download the launcher update + the patch now.
[3:22:20] <egoat> yes u can dl update and new launcher now but cannot lunch
[3:22:20] <lindadeann> Benchmark heavenward trailor best.
[3:22:20] <NRhyme> Or because the knights are wards of heaven?
[3:22:21] <nisekei> you'll never guess when you were finally allowed to fly in arr areas
[3:22:21] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> we ALL will be
[3:22:21] <Trinity5> @shin_goob you're fine, take your time chief
[3:22:22] <%Agami23> ARR didnt get flight until like 5.3

[3:23:15] <%RealThiele> BOOO THE THIRD
[3:23:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> yep
[3:23:16] <%BoxNavy> i honestly thought diadem was introduced in 5.x
[3:23:17] <@TheYellowcouch> Now we have rocket launcher
[3:23:18] <gryffinp> So was Diadem the shitty version of Eureka, which is the shitty version of Bozja, which is the shitty version of something hopefully good someday
[3:23:18] <%The_Protagonist> @zepherl what? it's still there
[3:23:19] <+Drigoooooo> yeah this is not the same Diadem
[3:23:19] <count_bob> The hell is Diadam?

[3:23:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> IIRC it was shitty Eureka Lite
[3:23:20] <%PauliusMaximus> before it was a crafting zone

[3:23:37] <%Monkeyweed21> WE WAITED 6 MONTHS FOR DIADEM
[3:23:38] <+Complete_Phased> It was Hard not Bad

[3:27:45] <gryffinp> I hate this entire raid series
[3:27:46] <NRhyme> SCAITH IS RAD
[3:27:46] <RaidenRising> CRIMES
[3:27:47] <+FinetiSonata> the hardest EX, but the easiest alliance raid
[3:27:47] <Trinity5> void ark is not greay
[3:27:47] <Latija> this story is good though
[3:27:47] <@TheYellowcouch> VOIDARK IS THE WORST
[3:27:48] <Cigwynn> Void Ark was kinda bad
[3:27:48] <+Complete_Phased> No Void Ark is good
[3:27:48] <+Solutha> Incorrect

[3:27:51] <UberWolfman> Yeh I dont like it as much as the others
[3:27:52] <+donpatrondx> i love the music, i hate the fights
[3:27:52] <$EsotericOdyssey> I prefer Mhach and Dun Scaith
[3:27:52] <lindadeann> Templar fight the best
[3:27:53] <MKII> watch these guys be very important in 6.1
[3:27:53] <+NYCrownlessKing> THE GAS ROOM @PatStaresAt
[3:27:53] <Shin_goob> i hated these raids
[3:27:54] <$ashenfrenzy> void ark is fine
[3:27:54] <+WippaDippa> its okay
[3:27:54] <KeiPrime> even the Gear sucks to look at
[3:27:54] <$StrawberryPantsu> VOID ARK WAS ALWAYS BAD
[3:27:55] <NRhyme> THE MOON THOUGH
[3:27:56] <mortalmanbaby> i lie it T.T
[3:27:56] <RushUnplugged> PAT WRONG
[3:27:56] <%WhereIsWill> void ark sucks ass
[3:27:57] <haisho> was it the poison? I bet it was the poison
[3:27:58] <ipodstroker_> YEP
[3:27:58] <+supersonic21> this might have big tie into endwalker
[3:27:59] <Cigwynn> IT GAVE ME A SICK HEALER GLAM THOUGH sajamNoise
[3:27:59] <@TheYellowcouch> I hat this entire set of alliance raids tbh
[3:27:59] <+nikoloas_> yeah void ark isn't great
[3:27:59] <Warbot40> Void Ark's fine
[3:27:59] <%kainhighwind1990> Void Ark is the only HW alliance raid that I like
[3:27:59] <+IxDomxI> DO SKY CRIMES
[3:28:00] <%RealThiele> its pretty boring
[3:28:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Void Ark is the 2nd worst Alliance Raid
[3:28:01] <WakeUpThrow> Void Ark is the worst alliance raid
[3:28:01] <%snugglepuggs> BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HR GIGER
[3:28:01] <+mrjous> I liked void ark
[3:28:01] <+donaghy> 2 and 3 are decent
[3:28:02] <+Greywyn00> Dun Scaith is one of my favorite 24mans
[3:28:02] <$ringabal> WASTE OF TIME, ALL
[3:28:02] <%commanderapathy> void ark DOES suck
[3:28:03] <%Wulfphelz> Void Ark is weak
[3:28:03] <%PatNTheHat> The whole time I did void ark I had the hiccups it was miserable
[3:28:04] <Srthunda> I like the last boss of void ark
[3:28:04] <RushUnplugged> CRAZY TALK
[3:28:04] <ArthurDoyleRPG> SKY CRIMES doodTerror
[3:28:04] <UnduexKaGo> Void Ark is extremely boring but Weeping City and Dun Scaith and nice
[3:28:04] <%Sirakou> But its still not the Wiping City
[3:28:05] <%TeepPhoenix> I love this music tho ;_;
[3:28:05] <+Kindan55> Void ark has a lot of cool shit
[3:28:05] <+FinetiSonata> void ark is so easy I get bored to tears
[3:28:05] <@TheYellowcouch> it's the one I actively dislike
[3:28:06] <%cascadepersona> Weeping City and Dun Scaith, however...
[3:28:06] <+SolGainer> the other 2 raids are much better
[3:28:06] <+SladeClegane> It looks nice
[3:28:07] <$radiocabel> BETTER THAN DUN SCAITH
[3:28:07] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Void Ark raid is terrible but the Void Ark itself was rad
[3:28:08] <AlexDaGr8> dun scaith is better
[3:28:08] <%WhereIsWill> THATS CUZ DUN SCAITH FUCKS
[3:28:09] <LordDudeTheFirst> I hate this whole series
[3:28:09] <skullneedles> I wish it was better, a ghost ship sky pirate raid should be the best thing ever
[3:28:10] <+Talimity> easy and boring bosses
[3:28:10] <%Valdorick> Void Ark isn't even good for its swag, because YOU CAN JUST CRAFT IT NOW
[3:28:10] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I thought the aesthetic and visuals of Void Ark was cool
[3:28:11] <RogueMinja> I never finished Void Ark.
[3:28:11] <%zepherl> Dun Scaith is the one I hate
[3:28:12] <mortalmanbaby> GEAR IS BEST FUCK YOU

[3:28:13] <+whoseblues> BUT SKY PIRATES THO
[3:28:13] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Void Ark definitely doesn't do anything fun or unique
[3:28:14] <luftraumm1> love the art design
[3:28:14] <Cosairen> better than the nightmare that was ozma
[3:28:15] <KnivesEve> but it looks coo l
[3:28:15] <%Frost_Quill> It's the other "you're getting this during raid roulette" one.
[3:28:16] <count_bob> void ark is okay.
[3:28:17] <doggieo> Yeah but that scarf tho
[3:28:18] <Laecerelius> GYAS!

[3:33:56] <+FZeroDMX> FLASH
[3:34:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So as a person who hasnt played this, why do you guys have aversion to some of these things? lol
[3:34:02] <gryffinp> I never did hall of the novice for dps or healers
[3:34:02] <%MaritimeFox> Tutorial good
[3:34:03] <%DashXero> @QueequegTheater Ah. What made the gameplay bad?

[4:15:36] <MarylandJutsu> This is so COOOOL
[4:15:37] <roobanguy> almost killed any motivation to get to shadowbringer
[4:15:38] <nevan_44> i liked SB a lot
[4:15:38] <%Conzanagi> Stormblood was good but Heavenwards and Shadowbringers were great
[4:15:38] <+YungTetsuoShima> storm blood trailer isn't had. just not nearly as good as the others
[4:15:39] <%Frost_Quill> I like Lyse but I liked her personality before better.
[4:15:42] <Cosairen> stormblood is great but lyse fucking SUCKS
[4:15:43] <wqorst> I started 14 for reals with SB so I like it :(
[4:15:43] <sa_turns> like papalymo died for this?
[4:15:44] <nisekei> hell yeah this expansion happened!
[4:15:45] <BaeSoora> great trailer - ass expac
[4:15:45] <$Futurecity10> ALA MHIGO SUCKS
[4:15:46] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[4:15:47] <theworsttimelime> this is when everyone decided: "WE NEED DANCER"
[4:15:49] <+poco_loco2> Best dps
[4:15:49] <joodatious> one storyline that sucks
[4:15:50] <%Wulfphelz> Love Stormblood great expansion
[4:15:50] <+IxDomxI> shinryu was fuckin great, aside from all the people who didnt do their fuckin 70 quests
[4:15:50] <NRhyme> into one dumpsterfire
[4:15:51] <LoreKeeper_Thal> YUP
[4:15:51] <%baka_sugoi> domen
[4:15:51] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[4:15:52] <Balsty> LUL
[4:15:52] <Trinity5> TRUE
[4:15:53] <+Talimity> FUCK ALA MHIGO
[4:15:53] <+totallynotbeesinaovercoat> I like Lylse
[4:15:53] <zerointelligence000> Yeah honestly
[4:15:53] <cassiusbright1157> LUL
[4:15:54] <%BioHunter> lol
[4:15:54] <%CalderGaming> lol
[4:15:54] <+Crimefridge> Good trailer, too bad Lyse is in it WineTime
[4:15:55] <UnduexKaGo> Stormblood combat content is still hella fun.
[4:15:55] <+Greywyn00> LUL
[4:15:56] <citerel> half of stormblood was really good
[4:15:56] <ItsJustShawn> The good half, and the other one
[4:15:56] <%kainhighwind1990> Fordola best SB character
[4:15:56] <%trizetacannon44> I actually really like Lyse
[4:15:57] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[4:15:58] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I read somewhere that Ishikawa says that if your headcanon is that you and Lyse bang after the sparring match then it's canon in your playthrough
[4:15:58] <%Agami23> yeah im confused why they combined them
[4:15:58] <UnduexKaGo> Susanoo is S tier.
[4:15:58] <%senorpapel> Stb isn’t bad, but lyse isn’t strong enough to carry the expac.
[4:15:58] <Ralfclogs> Yeahhh
[4:15:59] <MarylandJutsu> LOVE this fight though
[4:15:59] <%BoxNavy> this trailer owns
[4:15:59] <gryffinp> take: stormblood is bad but lyse is not the worst part of it, heck, lyse is probably in the top 50% of the bat parts of stormblood
[4:15:59] <squeakyclarinet> true tho
[4:15:59] <televisedrevolting> SBLORMTOD is now my new favorite thing ever of all time.
[4:16:00] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[4:16:00] <lindadeann> Still like this trailor better than any trailor
[4:16:02] <%KineticZen> There were so many better characters to represent Ala Mhigo's liberation
[4:16:02] <PkSilent01> I THINK ALA MIGO SUCKS
[4:16:03] <+SladeClegane> Bruh
[4:16:03] <T_Sasquatch> Im a fucking monk Simp , i cant HATE LYSE
[4:16:03] <Srthunda> why is ala mhigo such a badly done story aspect at every turn
[4:16:03] <metalsiren31> Stormblood is fuckin' DBZ and I love it
[4:16:03] <+LevinVel> yup
[4:16:04] <%BigCoffee> Ala Mhigo has amazing lore that is absolutely wasted in StB
[4:16:04] <+Greywyn00> TRUE
[4:16:04] <RaidenRising> YEP
[4:16:05] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> skip
[4:16:05] <%Reaviar> monk was robbed
[4:16:05] <%WhereIsWill> FOR DOMA MHIGO
[4:16:06] <+SolGainer> HEY LOOK DANCER KAPPA
[4:16:06] <Warbot40> I don't get why people hate Lyse THIS MUCH. She's not amazing but BOY she ain't that bad.
[4:16:07] <+BeardedLuchador> I was a little sad at how underserved the Monks were during Stormblood
[4:16:08] <%MisterRockett> It took me forever to realize this was the WoL
[4:16:08] <+Havictos> Doma was clearly the more important part for real @PatStaresAt
[4:16:10] <+supersonic21> stormblood walked so shadowbringers could run
[4:16:10] <gryffinp> Also this monk guy does not read as Canon Wol Man to me
[4:16:12] <metalsiren31> pvpLUL
[4:16:13] <Gloppie> Zenos DansGame
[4:16:14] <gryffinp> he feels like a different person
[4:16:15] <nisekei> i still do not get why lyse's backstory is the way that it was
[4:16:16] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Is this whats called Combat sex?
[4:16:16] <%BioHunter> tbf DOMA was way better than Ala mihgo
[4:16:17] <lindadeann> Best trailor
[4:16:18] <%GelatinBoi> SB is a polarizing expac but I still really enjoyed my time
[4:16:18] <nisekei> what was her reveal even
[4:16:19] <majindusto> This is preet cool looking  tho
[4:16:19] <churropoppa> I always thought this was from Black Desert LUL
[4:16:20] <sa_turns> doh ino
[4:16:20] <%averyoddjew> also how is the empire a threat?
[4:16:20] <%InternetShis> Ala Mhigo got shafted TWICE in one expac
[4:16:20] <@ssjklyco> Boobs
[4:16:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @BigCoffee does it tho
[4:16:22] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Y/N: Fordola is the best SB villain?
[4:16:24] <%BoxNavy> zenos coneyVINCE
[4:16:25] <%Conzanagi> This trailer is awesome though
[4:16:25] <+BeardedLuchador> They hyped it up like Stormblood was gonna be this huge MNK lore expansion but there wasn't even a quest.
[4:16:25] <%commanderapathy> Yotsuyu deserved better
[4:16:26] <+Talimity> did they fuck
[4:16:27] <%barrakuta371> This gives me Wuxia vibes
[4:16:29] <BaeSoora> stormblood sucked ass so shadowbringers could fuck ass
[4:16:29] <%thedankestmeeme> @QueequegTheater believable
[4:16:30] <%Birdigalore> The ONLY time Lyse was ever cool
[4:16:30] <majindusto> *pretty
[4:16:30] <NRhyme> STORMBLOOD FELL BECAUSE SHADOWBRINGERS WANTED SOMETHING TO WALK ON
[4:16:31] <+EternalInquisitor> I pray for Lyse's death every time she's on screen
[4:16:31] <%Wulfphelz> It was such a treg to get to Doma LUL
[4:16:32] <Maverick2736> AND THEN THEY FUCKED
[4:16:32] <+MosesUnspoken> Trailer Lyse > in game Lyse
[4:16:32] <cassiusbright1157> 4.0 is definitely the weakest story, but the content is so strong it doesn't even matter.
[4:16:32] <+BeardedLuchador> Or like maybe 1
[4:16:33] <%TeepPhoenix> remember, when this trailer first came out, we had no idea who that blonde actually was, they waited for the Yda/Lyse reveal
[4:16:33] <$EsotericOdyssey> the best far east zone was Azim Steppe
[4:16:33] <MarylandJutsu> Gief NEEDS MOR FOOD
[4:16:36] <%Valdorick> Fucking Doma should have been ALL of 4.0. You start in Ala Migo, get your ass pushed in by Zenos, then spend the REST OF THE PATCH trying to disrupt Alamigo via Doma Liberation.
[4:16:36] <lindadeann> Rating trailor along SSS
[4:16:36] <T_Sasquatch> @kainhighwind1990 ew
[4:16:37] <%baka_sugoi> fuck fight?
[4:16:37] <%asgard147> yes psaDogchamp
[4:16:37] <Srthunda> fuck fordola
[4:16:37] <sa_turns> dohmingo if you will
[4:16:38] <haisho> it really doesn't help that the Doman stuff is memorable
[4:16:39] <vicar_anat> EVERYBODY LOVES KUNG FU FIGHTING
[4:16:39] <%BoxNavy> no zenos is
[4:16:39] <joodatious> true
[4:16:40] <+dujam> i WISH we got ala mhigo as a fucking actual city instead of kugane
[4:16:41] <+MoonObscure> AGREED
[4:16:42] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, Ala Mhigo got done so dirty
[4:16:42] <bbbbuttts1> no zenos is
[4:16:42] <$EsotericOdyssey> Yotsuyu is great
[4:16:43] <%DianaTheAscian> She's great
[4:16:43] <MarylandJutsu> Yotsuyu is great
[4:16:43] <%Frost_Quill> So if this is the WoL why did he get a haircut and then get longer hair in Doma?
[4:16:45] <RushUnplugged> Yotsuyo forever
[4:16:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Fordola has some fucking top tier VA work for her
[4:16:45] <$Futurecity10> Yosuyu sucks I hate that I couldnt kill her
[4:16:46] <zerointelligence000> This is actually the first thing I've ever seen of FF14 so this is kinda nostalgic
[4:16:46] <Cosairen> yotsuyu sticks to the bit
[4:16:47] <joodatious> this trailer is boring
[4:16:47] <Mattais88> This is fucking cool
[4:16:49] <%cascadepersona> Zenos is
[4:16:50] <%CzeekyTV> Stormblood villains being any good LUL
[4:16:51] <BarnYardFiddler> This hand reminds me of the statue hand in FFVII
[4:16:51] <%shadowsofpain> They couldn't be more blunt about how much they didn't care about the Ala Mhigo plot line
[4:16:52] <Apolonm> Raubahn Savage
[4:16:53] <aln1yat> man was this expansion boring
[4:16:54] <Vermillion129> Yea having to do same storyline twice in one expac is pepega
[4:16:54] <LadyWyvernne> I burned out for months in the middle of 4.0
[4:16:54] <28moogles> What if we just removed all personality from one of the main characters along with her outfit change?
[4:16:54] <theworsttimelime> nah clearly its Magnai Kappa
[4:16:55] <+MoonObscure> I LOVE YOTSUYU
[4:16:55] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Fordola's parent got what they deserved
[4:16:56] <nevan_44> zenos was the highlight of SB for me
[4:16:57] <Ids560> Lyse is the best stormblood villain
[4:16:58] <@QueequegTheater> She's like 4th lmao
[4:16:59] <17sevens> this scene spoils that the wol will want to punch lyse in the face
[4:16:59] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> !Skip
[4:17:00] <%Birdigalore> Nah man Grynewaht's the best lol
[4:17:01] <nisekei> yotsuyu is consistent at least
[4:17:01] <gryffinp> the thing is Doma ALSO sucks. Doma is two shitty villages. Hingashi is cool as shit but you don't liberate it! Yanxia is hype as fuck but you don't liberate it!
[4:17:01] <$EsotericOdyssey> "STEP ON ME PLEASE" - YoshiP @ yotsuyu cosplayer
[4:17:03] <%Conzanagi> Tsuyu is only because of the patches afterwards imo. She really needed them
[4:17:03] <+trifecta89> now kith
[4:17:03] <%Frost_Quill> It's implying this all took place over a longer span of time than anything from before?
[4:17:03] <BlueTunicLink> Yotsuyu carried the SB villains
[4:17:04] <+FinetiSonata> yotsuyu is the best thing about stormblood
[4:17:05] <+SilverJakler> wait people don't like Lese?
[4:17:05] <%cade_calrayn> now kiss
[4:17:07] <+SilverJakler> Lyse*
[4:17:07] <%Valdorick> @theworsttimelime Little Sun
[4:17:10] <$ONotation> Even in the trailer, I just skip the Ala Mhigan parts
[4:17:11] <NRhyme> Although, Stormblood did give Yotsuyu, so I'll forgive it for that
[4:17:11] <$ringabal> hi Garle-Bye Garlemald!
[4:17:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> and then they fucked
[4:17:12] <+supersonic21> what a cock tease
[4:17:12] <%senorpapel> Yotsuyu is a huge highlight of stormblood. Especially patch content
[4:17:14] <@ssjklyco> Just make a Final Fantasy fighitng game in XIV
[4:17:15] <mastertwin2> god it looked so bad when they did that shot ingame
[4:17:16] <Tracazoid> And yet monk still wasn't good
[4:17:17] <%Monkeyweed21> I cant believe Yotsuyu broke our french press
[4:17:17] <Cosairen> double dps jobs Kreygasm
[4:17:18] <%Jeemukun> but Yotsuyu sucks
[4:17:19] <$Quigsies> lyse is a plank of wood
[4:17:20] <peyodogo> i vastly preferred fordola, not because i liked her but bc she was a good villain
[4:17:20] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> such a split in chat
[4:17:21] <ItsJustShawn> see you in two expansions garlemald
[4:17:22] <gryffinp> This trailer does NOT want to admit that awesome japan town is not where you are actually fighting to save.
[4:17:25] <joodatious> the steppes is the only good part of stormblood
[4:17:26] <Theoretic101> fuck Lyse
[4:17:28] <MarylandJutsu> WE IN ASIA NOW BOYS
[4:17:29] <Notorious_Mic> Soon
[4:17:30] <+GingerSen> Watttterrrr
[4:17:31] <%Valdorick> It'd be better than fucking ALA MIGO
[4:17:33] <+wizard_of_diamonds> THE FAR EAST LAND OF YAMATO!?
[4:17:34] <%BoxNavy> what if we went under the water
[4:17:35] <%tyler274> this was a wasted zone
[4:17:36] <@ssjklyco> Water Asia
[4:17:37] <%PatNTheHat> Asiatlantis
[4:17:37] <%whyskeywolfe> Class Unlocked: RAGN AZN
[4:17:38] <LadyWyvernne> Fordola was massively better, but also criminally underutilized.
[4:17:39] <%InternetShis> IN 4.0, Yotsuyu is the best. Zenos is still boring here.
[4:17:39] <@QueequegTheater> @Theoretic101 First comment, off to a good start
[4:17:41] <%KineticZen> Good ol' Waterball
[4:17:42] <PerfectAsymmetry> This is such a stinger in the trailer but it's just a lvl 63 dungeon
[4:17:42] <%croxeye> Fordola's whole thing is she tries giving you these shitty justifications for her actions, then glimpsing your past and realizing her reasoning was bull
[4:17:43] <+Shoosler> stormblood was DOPE
[4:17:45] <+Nomenanza> ok but legit chills from that ruvy palace shot
[4:17:45] <+Edrem> even stormblood trailer was teasing floating area above garlemald
[4:17:46] <%KineticZen> Literally, water ball
[4:17:47] <lindadeann> In 6.0 I predict Monk will be best job
[4:17:48] <+FZeroDMX> Shisui is cool
[4:17:50] <MarylandJutsu> yeah......
[4:17:51] <RushUnplugged> @SilverJakler I like Lyse as a character, as in she's supposed to be a bad ruler, just a good charismatic figure for the revolution
[4:17:52] <MarylandJutsu> yeah
[4:17:53] <gryffinp> this is NOT the place you are fighting to liberate, remember that
[4:17:53] <%shadowsofpain> He Garlenald tease that we'll never see in an un-fucked state
[4:17:53] <%Monkeyweed21> BOY DID WE
[4:17:54] <Cosairen> monk got fucking shot in the street by samurai
[4:17:54] <ZeeJiggle> HERE I AM, CHAT. THIS IS ME.
[4:17:54] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> easier to play yoo
[4:17:54] <BaeSoora> 'fuck garlemald, we aint going there... YET'
[4:17:56] <%asgard147> YEP
[4:17:56] <@QueequegTheater> Tamamizu is fucking cool tho
[4:17:57] <+BeardedLuchador> YEAH THEY DID
[4:17:58] <%baka_sugoi> A N I M E sp00nPOG
[4:17:58] <%BoxNavy> monk got straight robbed my simply existing
[4:17:58] <hexen_emma> Monk got shafted so hard
[4:17:58] <aln1yat> auron?!
[4:17:58] <toyforus235> weebs
[4:17:58] <MarylandJutsu> THAT OutFIT
[4:17:58] <theworsttimelime> still is
[4:17:59] <GandhiTheTerrible> yeah
[4:18:00] <ItsJustShawn> SAM got robbed, because they have to share armor visuals with MNK
[4:18:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> "what if we put monk next to Vergil"
[4:18:00] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt I thought Samurai was awful at release?
[4:18:01] <%Frost_Quill> Samurai was originally going to be a tank.
[4:18:01] <gryffinp> this is cool japan city and NOT DOMA
[4:18:01] <UnduexKaGo> any Tornado Kick rotation enjoyers
[4:18:01] <%sonuke_draws> hard being a monk
[4:18:02] <MayShip> it has a sword. of course it is
[4:18:02] <%BoxNavy> by*
[4:18:03] <televisedrevolting> Sblormtod forever...
[4:18:04] <+BeardedLuchador> YEAH MONK TOTALLY GOT ROBBED
[4:18:06] <$Quigsies> DRIP
[4:18:06] <AdmiralButtloaf> people get so toxic about stormblood
[4:18:07] <joodatious> it sucked man
[4:18:07] <luftraumm1> monk got fricked
[4:18:08] <%averyoddjew> because sword
[4:18:08] <NBD_Rab> they shoulda made monk fun then
[4:18:08] <mortificent> SAMURAI IS THE COOLEST
[4:18:08] <squeakyclarinet> You don't even get unique lines for it in MSQ...
[4:18:09] <%Monkeyweed21> SAM ate MNKs lunch until 5.05
[4:18:09] <NRhyme> Just cut MNK
[4:18:11] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> striking gear
[4:18:11] <+Kyma1020> Yeah Monk got fucked in Stormblood
[4:18:11] <+FinetiSonata> monk lasted half a trailer...
[4:18:11] <%Frost_Quill> It was originally going to be a tank.
[4:18:12] <%Wulfphelz> Not being able to walk in Ala Mhigo was a stinker too
[4:18:13] <RushUnplugged> Monk got erased by Sam
[4:18:13] <ExistentialSteak> hasnt changed since then
[4:18:13] <@ssjklyco> It's Sam Raimi
[4:18:13] <cassiusbright1157> I didn't play Monk and I still wasn't happy
[4:18:13] <%Valdorick> And then Redmage also existed... but at least redmage sucked at first.
[4:18:13] <+Drigoooooo> but MNK is looking nice now
[4:18:13] <+RelikaNox> Was monk back then, can confirm
[4:18:14] <Treasure_Vault> Just replace Monk class with Monkey class
[4:18:15] <%BlueLunecy> Well Monks will be eating well tomorrow
[4:18:15] <+SolGainer> IT'S MONKS TIME NOW
[4:18:15] <$ONotation> And the super messed up Lilies for WHM
[4:18:17] <+polothegreatest> chinese sales go up, japan sales go up
[4:18:17] <NRhyme> Save everyone the trouble
[4:18:18] <MarylandJutsu> soft burgers
[4:18:18] <Vermillion129> Sam was op in SB
[4:18:18] <$ringabal> SWORDMASTER
[4:18:19] <%senorpapel> Samurai is way cooler than monk too.
[4:18:19] <%StaceMcGate> NIPON STEEL
[4:18:19] <TheTakkster> @PatStaresAt When's the last time monks were happy?
[4:18:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HITEN MISTURUGI
[4:18:20] <%DashXero> C'mon... Monks aren't weeb bait like Samurai. It makes sense.
[4:18:20] <Phob05> Every other trailer has so much story significance and this is just "But what if they punch?"
[4:18:20] <+Havictos> touch the jowls
[4:18:21] <+Akabane101> It's even cooler because of this scene right here hahaha
[4:18:21] <Tonberry46> Im so glad Monk's getting the rework
[4:18:22] <%BoxNavy> stormblood meteor is so hot
[4:18:22] <jorniev> SAMURAI STRAIGHT UP LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE COOLEST CHARACTERS IN THE SERIES
[4:18:23] <RittiFruity> Monk got element tackle.....
[4:18:23] <%TheAntiNihilist> BETTEREST
[4:18:23] <joodatious> as one of the 6 monk players i agree pat
[4:18:24] <%TeepPhoenix> i think this is the expansion where PLD got a legitimate heal
[4:18:24] <%CalderGaming> lol i thought you were talking about wol for a sec
[4:18:24] <+BeardedLuchador> THE MONK DUNGEON DOESN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE UR A MNK

[4:21:17] <gryffinp> The concept of a "regional anthem" that's a rewriting of a conquered territory's national anthem into one singing the empire's praises is so incredibly imperialistic. dangerously based.

Thanks for talking about XIV on the podcast now and then, got me and my wife to try it out a few months back, and we finished SHB this week.

[4:25:36] <$Quigsies> FUCK FORDOLA
[4:25:37] <+EternalInquisitor> Fucking F.
[4:25:37] <dan_g_v> no buts
[4:25:37] <+TheCityBeast> B
[4:25:37] <%DianaTheAscian> aw really? I  thought it was low B @PatStaresAt
[4:25:38] <+SladeClegane> Mostly good stuff
[4:25:38] <+GingerSen> Oh yeahhhh
[4:25:40] <$ONotation> Stormblood had so many problems on release
[4:25:41] <+GingerSen> right
[4:25:41] <+Ghazarban> Fair
[4:25:41] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> F-
[4:25:42] <wretchedautomaton> RAUBHAN

[4:25:51] <%Monkeyweed21> fair
[4:25:51] <cassiusbright1157> You don't need to explain it to me, I lived it for hours
[4:25:52] <luftraumm1> eh

[4:25:52] <+Phoenon> Raubahn(Ultimate) LUL
[4:25:52] <+justianxix> Try to
[4:25:53] <BlueTunicLink> The SIDE content of SB is fucking great, the main story is mediocre, bordering on bad.
[4:25:53] <+Ghazarban> unmitigated disaster
[4:25:53] <hexen_emma> IT WAS SUCH A DISASTER
[4:25:54] <+FinetiSonata> wasn't it the whole first weekend?
[4:25:54] <+nikoloas_> thats fair
[4:25:55] <BreakfastSampler> can he finish his thought without saying 'lyse'
[4:25:55] <mikesapartment> it was literally 3 days you're exaggerating
[4:25:55] <LoreKeeper_Thal> with no issues, it's a low B, with issues, it's C
[4:25:58] <+EriksBlue> yep
[4:25:58] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> F
[4:25:58] <toyforus235> the fact that its next expansion to heavenwards
[4:25:58] <+supersonic21> i was in heavensward when it came out so i didnt get the wall
[4:25:59] <+TheCityBeast> RAUBAHN'S LINE
[4:26:00] <+doctor_brofessor> What was wrong with it?
[4:26:00] <+Masutasodo> I remember og shake it off for warrior lmao
[4:26:02] <+Artistorphy> Raubahn EX, Pipin Savage and Susano Ultimate
[4:26:03] <+Talimity> ARR's launch was even worse lol
[4:26:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> DOnt judge it on the past
[4:26:04] <%Ninestempest> rauban savage was fucked
[4:26:05] <wretchedautomaton> i was at the wall for 7 hours
[4:26:05] <Latija> pls Endwalker work ok
[4:26:05] <gryffinp> The Minstrel's Ballad: Rhauban
[4:26:05] <roobanguy> it was worse than arr too me even though i played it in 2020
[4:26:07] <+Wolfstriker121> b
[4:26:07] <+EternalInquisitor> Bold move not putting  this hot garbage straight in F
[4:26:09] <%asgard147> I remember you talking about that on the podcast
[4:26:10] <+Kyma1020> It's my biggest fear for tomorrow
[4:26:11] <+sinistersally> I was one of the few that got through first day
[4:26:12] <+crossfire14> leveled up rdm didnt bother me lol
[4:26:12] <+dujam> i remember you trying to stream it and having no choice but to give up
[4:26:13] <+starlorb3> what was wrong with the wall
[4:26:15] <%BoxNavy> thats a good spot
[4:26:16] <SharKinStereo> rauban's wall destroyed my FC
[4:26:16] <KrazeArcain> Understandable
[4:26:16] <+supersonic21> we almost had chair EX
[4:26:17] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> F-
[4:26:17] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> it had to do too much for one expansion too
[4:26:17] <artoflec> can someone who hasnt touched FFXIV understand what made it so bad HahaSweat
[4:26:19] <%ClericOfSparda> I took a break from FF14 when StB came out and am kinda glad I did
[4:26:20] <theworsttimelime> what was the wall exactly?
[4:26:20] <HimakiLuvsU> at least they got it right
[4:26:21] <lindadeann> Way better now
[4:26:22] <hexen_emma> DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE BUG WHERE YOU'D GET LOCKED OUT OF THE GAME AFTER SUSANNO
[4:26:23] <%Monkeyweed21> yea fair
[4:26:23] <MayShip> thanks Rhauban
[4:26:24] <+R_BChe> tomorrow is Krile wall monkaS
[4:26:24] <joodatious> bad
[4:26:25] <lindadeann> A
[4:26:26] <%Wulfphelz> Stormblood patches really were what carried the expansion, more so than HW
[4:26:26] <%BoxNavy> poop
[4:26:27] <%asgard147> okay
[4:26:27] <%afronooch> Doma rules
[4:26:28] <+fetrigon> I wasn't their during launch and I don't know what this is. S+ PunOko
[4:26:29] <metalsiren31> You know that's fair
[4:26:30] <%KineticZen> Empty clay desert is what it was
[4:26:31] <gryffinp> I wouldn't even give it one half, the Steppe was excellent, the rest was bleh
[4:26:33] <%Reaviar> filler
[4:26:34] <+GingerSen> Felt Filler
[4:26:34] <28moogles> I stood in line for 4 hours and it didn't work, it was just people leaving the line that made it go up.
[4:26:35] <NRhyme> I LIKE LYSE THE LEAST
[4:26:36] <%Reaviar> it was filler arc
[4:26:39] <HimakiLuvsU> the first half or the second half
[4:26:40] <%Monkeyweed21> one half of Stormblood exists
[4:26:41] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:26:41] <+Wolfstriker121> that was bad
[4:26:41] <%cascadepersona> Ala Mhigo was the worst
[4:26:41] <+Greywyn00> Ala Mhigo is so lame
[4:26:42] <+superrhubarbpie> Stormblood really is the DS2 of FF14 expansions
[4:26:43] <+Ghazarban> hey man, houses NEED keeping
[4:26:43] <GandhiTheTerrible> Filler
[4:26:44] <Augus7717> whut?
[4:26:44] <+MosesUnspoken> Zenos SUCKS
[4:26:45] <+Crimefridge> I worry about Endwalker being the Stormblood to Shadowbringers crumpSweat
[4:26:45] <Fathuran> What???
[4:26:47] <joodatious> the ending 25% of stormblood is good
[4:26:48] <%GelatinBoi> Doma was good. Ala Mhigo was robbed
[4:26:49] <Ginganinja4545> Doma was god tier
[4:26:51] <theworsttimelime> Doma carried this expansion
[4:26:52] <RaidenRising> it was a filler arc
[4:26:54] <%Monkeyweed21> DONT FORGET ABOUT THE EMOTE BUG
[4:26:54] <%senorpapel> Lyse half was bad half
[4:26:55] <%commanderapathy> why does everyone hate lyse?
[4:26:55] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[4:26:55] <lindadeann> Story set up
[4:26:57] <citerel> the middle half of stormblood was amazing
[4:26:57] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Ala Mhigo should have been it's own expac so it had more time to be flushed out and be better
[4:26:57] <+Drigoooooo> let's get to the best part of Stormblood it's patches
[4:26:58] <PerfectAsymmetry> Stormblood would've been better if Raubahn was the poster guy instead of Lyse
[4:26:58] <HimakiLuvsU> no don't say that
[4:26:58] <+GingerSen> Shinryu was a sick fight tho
[4:26:58] <@QueequegTheater> What
[4:26:59] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> F
[4:26:59] <+starlorb3> Fuck Ryse
[4:27:00] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[4:27:00] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Seem like Ala Mhigo was just filler tbh
[4:27:01] <%ClericOfSparda> Pretty much
[4:27:02] <+Artistorphy> Raubahn EX, Pipin Savage and Susano Ultimate. The trials and tribulations of the Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit
[4:27:02] <toyforus235> what about lyse?
[4:27:03] <gryffinp> Actual doma is bad, Hingashi and Azim Steppe are good
[4:27:03] <$EsotericOdyssey> @MosesUnspoken zenos sucks.. me, hard, thru my jorts
[4:27:05] <Balsty> doma good alamhigo bad
[4:27:06] <metalsiren31> YEP
[4:27:06] <HimakiLuvsU> Endwalker is gonna be amazing. Right??????
[4:27:06] <%shadowsofpain> Shinryu was cool though
[4:27:07] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Azim stepe was my fav part Dotharl life
[4:27:07] <%BoxNavy> zenos hate will not be tolerated moon2A
[4:27:08] <HimakiLuvsU> RIGHT?!?!
[4:27:09] <+Phoenon> There is no war in Doma Sing Se :)
[4:27:12] <mortificent> The Ending is the best tho
[4:27:15] <%afronooch> I love stormblood, but I also forget ala mihgo exists
[4:27:16] <thunderborn32> people erase bad from their memory and complain that you dont
[4:27:16] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:27:21] <lindadeann> Doma was not everything
[4:27:21] <%kysath> @PatStaresAt Seeing people on twitter tell me lyse was a good character makes me feel like I'm being gaslit
[4:27:21] <cassiusbright1157> @Crimefridge I'm not too worried about that since Endwalker seems a lot more focused on a single story, whereas Stormblood was really split
[4:27:22] <+TheRockingM> Shinryu and Susano'o were amazing tho
[4:27:25] <+teca78> What happened with Raubahns wall?
[4:27:26] <+calzonewithextracheese> Zenos is a one note character
[4:27:29] <@QueequegTheater> Sadu best battle wife
[4:27:29] <+SladeClegane> That’s an exceptionally binary viewpoint
[4:27:30] <%Wulfphelz> FeelsBadMan
[4:27:30] <WakeUpThrow> Such a downgrade
[4:27:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt remember the emote bug where you would exit a dungeon and then clip out of world and need a GM to save you
[4:27:34] <$ringabal> @EsotericOdyssey Really gives new meaning to "I accept you."
[4:27:36] <+Greywyn00> Shinryu EX is such a cool fight
[4:27:43] <%cascadepersona> @commanderapathy She feels pretty bland and she didn't feel pivotal to the overall liberation of Ala Mhigo
[4:27:44] <17sevens> @calzonewithextracheese it's a fun note though
[4:27:45] <lindadeann> Look at benchmarks
[4:27:46] <%afronooch> monkaW
[4:27:47] <+FinetiSonata> though Omega was a cool raid series mostly
[4:27:47] <theworsttimelime> monkaS
[4:27:48] <LadyWyvernne> Doma felt like a complete waste of time to me, because nothing that happens there has any bearing on anything.  Azime Steppe was fun enough, but that was about it.
[4:27:49] <%DianaTheAscian> What time is the Endwalker early access for PST?
[4:27:49] <@Mechz71> i hear Eureka
[4:27:49] <MidnightPacif1c> monkaS

[4:27:57] <Ralfclogs> monkaS
[4:27:58] <+fetrigon> @himakiluvsu nah it's gonna be a disappointment. Just like the other expansions :)

[4:28:09] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> BoOOO
[4:28:10] <$ringabal> FUCKING CAPITALISM
[4:28:11] <%TeepPhoenix> wat
[4:28:11] <+RaveBV> oh look, it's pat
[4:28:12] <%croxeye> @DianaTheAscian PST is 0100 AM i think
[4:28:12] <+Talimity> LIL DORITO
[4:28:12] <$EsotericOdyssey> @ringabal the only thing I accept is whatever that mouth do
[4:28:12] <NRhyme> THAT VOICE IS TERRIBAD
[4:28:13] <zerointelligence000> STFU lolorito
[4:28:13] <lindadeann> Go check
[4:28:15] <%Frost_Quill> FUCK YOU LOLORITO
[4:28:15] <gryffinp> good god is that what english lolotiro sounds like
[4:28:18] <+BIumen> i am going to k-word him
[4:28:18] <theworsttimelime> lil DoritosChip

[4:28:18] <%DianaTheAscian> Thx
[4:28:19] <%cascadepersona> YOOOOUUUU
[4:28:19] <%KineticZen> Eureka theme, maaaaan
[4:28:19] <+MoonObscure> I ENJOYED EUREKA
[4:28:20] <%kainhighwind1990> was that pat
[4:28:21] <%commanderapathy> fuck you lolorito!
[4:28:22] <RittiFruity> Eureka pog
[4:28:22] <%senorpapel> @commanderapathy at least for me. She is a fun side character, but she is too one dimensional to carry an expansion. And she didn’t change enough to grow into the role she was in. So her portion of the expac became really underwhelming
[4:28:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> :<
[4:28:24] <%KineticZen> So many hours
[4:28:24] <mr_saturday93> Sounds like mark Hamill
[4:28:24] <wretchedautomaton> I'm actually having a reaction to hearing eureka music
[4:28:24] <+MoonObscure> AND I GOT MY ORB
[4:28:28] <UberWolfman> FUCK U DORITO LALA
[4:28:31] <gryffinp> I'm growing convinced the reason most people hate ARR Alphinaud and Lolorito in general is because the english dub
[4:28:33] <Cosairen> lolorito can go die
[4:28:34] <%kainhighwind1990> j/k
[4:28:34] <$spleekle> LUL DoritosChip
[4:28:35] <$Futurecity10> who
[4:28:36] <skullneedles> eureka is almost good
[4:28:39] <%Frost_Quill> I like Arenvald.
[4:28:40] <%Faustgesicht> the music is fucking giving me stress
[4:28:40] <cassiusbright1157> D:
[4:28:40] <Latija> i love Arenvald
[4:28:41] <%BoxNavy> :)
[4:28:41] <+lojack69> ya this goes in F with 1.0

[4:28:45] <BlueEagle2395> fuck u arenvald is our boi D:
[4:28:48] <lindadeann> Gotcha
[4:28:49] <%lumenousarc> Arenvald is the best Pat!
[4:28:49] <Cosairen> arenvald aint got no legs :)
[4:28:50] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt Arvenvald puts the End Walk in Endwalker
[4:28:51] <MayShip> he's kinda cool but i forgot he existed
[4:28:51] <+laughing_squidly> Arenvald is good
[4:28:51] <TheFakeBob> he's okay
[4:28:52] <%afronooch> i like fordola, but only cause shes mean
[4:28:52] <%shadowsofpain> I cared about him
[4:28:53] <$Futurecity10> I have no fucking idea who Arenvald is
[4:28:53] <+goldexp123> It ends up working eventually
[4:28:54] <+Hertzeil> This patch was boooooring.
[4:28:54] <+supersonic21> i mean hes dope now
[4:28:54] <ItsJustShawn> coming back for SHB, I straight up didn't remember Arenvald
[4:28:55] <%lumenousarc> He's great!
[4:28:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Arenvald is ok
[4:28:56] <%BoxNavy> hes another krile situation
[4:28:57] <theworsttimelime> yea Arenvald just suddenly became a character outta nowhere
[4:28:57] <Ginganinja4545> Arenvald is cool now
[4:28:58] <%cascadepersona> I forgot Arenvald existed
[4:28:59] <%ClericOfSparda> Ul'dah: Helping Ala Mighans fuck off for profit,
[4:28:59] <Balsty> fair tbh
[4:28:59] <gryffinp> I don't want Arenvald to leave my screen but I never want him to appear either
[4:29:01] <+Catoclystic> Skalla gear wooo
[4:29:01] <+GingerSen> hes the B team captain
[4:29:01] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> true
[4:29:01] <LoreKeeper_Thal> we needed more time with him
[4:29:02] <Youknowwhyimhere008> plagueTaps
[4:29:03] <%KineticZen> We did an Indiana Jones treasure vault raid with him and not much else
[4:29:04] <Cosairen> SKALLA IS GREAAAAAAAAAT
[4:29:05] <lindadeann> You should
[4:29:06] <$EsotericOdyssey> the joke is that Arenvald cannot walk anymore
[4:29:06] <NRhyme> Is it okay to be racist against Ala Mhigans?
[4:29:07] <+EinTheBusinessDeer> Poisontounge is a daddy
[4:29:07] <+doctor_brofessor> the drowned city armor is great
[4:29:07] <joodatious> Arenvald is alright but eh
[4:29:08] <citerel> arenvald is like the other dudes in the rising stones
[4:29:09] <skullneedles> WHEN'S NEXT GALES
[4:29:09] <+Greywyn00> I remember nothing about him
[4:29:09] <+TheCityBeast> Arenvald needed more time
[4:29:09] <+Crimefridge> @cassiusbright1157 my concern is that the portions with Fandaniel were the worst parts of Shadowbringers
[4:29:10] <%Conzanagi> Arenvald is cool but he is a bit player
[4:29:10] <livi242> I liked him in 5.5
[4:29:10] <%JoshManVGH> I'm just glad my grandson has a friend
[4:29:10] <+miguelrod777> who
[4:29:11] <LoreKeeper_Thal> SAME LUL
[4:29:11] <Latija> true
[4:29:11] <%UvBenServed> LOOK AT THAT YU GI OH PAINTING
[4:29:12] <HimakiLuvsU> Arenvald is a ghost
[4:29:12] <%averyoddjew> he was just kinda there
[4:29:12] <%asgard147> he's okay
[4:29:12] <+EriksBlue> You do a treasure hunt with him and alphi
[4:29:13] <Ralfclogs> Arenvald is from ARR
[4:29:14] <+FZeroDMX> I love Skalla
[4:29:14] <GandhiTheTerrible> true
[4:29:15] <+Talimity> D:
[4:29:15] <%croxeye> he was in the rising stones
[4:29:15] <%CzeekyTV> Arenvald had a ton of optional dialogue in ARR
[4:29:16] <+poco_loco2> Oh no, anyways: the character
[4:29:16] <+goldexp123> We could've
[4:29:17] <+Havictos> He's been the one taking out Primal when we weren't around
[4:29:17] <$Quigsies> HER BACKSTORY IS THE WORST
[4:29:17] <%BoxNavy> yes :)
[4:29:18] <MayShip> true
[4:29:18] <+2DSuperiority> you spend more time with Krile
[4:29:20] <+EternalInquisitor> CORRECT
[4:29:20] <Cigwynn> ngl, I kinda like Fordola
[4:29:21] <+MosesUnspoken> "I can fix her"
[4:29:21] <WakeUpThrow> I agree
[4:29:21] <%DianaTheAscian> Yeah
[4:29:22] <gryffinp> She agrees with you!
[4:29:22] <Trinity5> arenvald the walk ender
[4:29:22] <%jdwhalen> I need a good bonding moment, ideally with some comedy to really dig a character
[4:29:24] <%shadowsofpain> and now he is the Endwalker
[4:29:25] <%WhereIsWill> no but she got cool tho
[4:29:25] <LadyWyvernne> Lakshmi refight did a lot of work propping up Arenvald for me.
[4:29:25] <+MoonObscure> LOL
[4:29:26] <Cigwynn> But you right
[4:29:26] <joodatious> LYSE SUCKS
[4:29:27] <Cosairen> they should have really fuckin killed that bitch
[4:29:27] <+IxDomxI> @PatStaresAt arenvald does all his cool shit with alphinaud offscreen so you dont get to know him
[4:29:27] <%velemi> EVEN FORDOLA AGREES
[4:29:28] <%KineticZen> Maybe the Empire was onto something with the whole "savages" thing
[4:29:28] <LilacsandFreedom> but now she can cope, seethe, and mald forever
[4:29:28] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> he was a side character in arr, you'd had to talk to him in the waking sands
[4:29:28] <RaidenRising> yep
[4:29:29] <lindadeann> Alphie’s big bro
[4:29:32] <Latija> she's helping noew
[4:29:32] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Just blat blat right in front of everyone
[4:29:32] <%Wulfphelz> Should've die
[4:29:32] <+goldexp123> Untrue :)
[4:29:33] <Warbot40> Fordola is too useful though
[4:29:34] <%tyler274> he doesnt get cutscene time, but he showed up in the background of the rising stones all through patch content and had some small character dev
[4:29:34] <%baka_sugoi> oh no FEELS
[4:29:35] <vicar_anat> Sad swing music go
[4:29:35] <UberWolfman> But Pat Violence breeds violence :)
[4:29:36] <$ringabal> "I can save her."
[4:29:36] <HimakiLuvsU> that's pretty bad
[4:29:36] <%commanderapathy> they should 've given her the chair
[4:29:37] <+ArticPath> But she saw our story so now she is a hero...that is how that works
[4:29:37] <+fetrigon> yeah same. arenvald could've had more time for character development.
[4:29:38] <%cascadepersona> Fair
[4:29:38] <HimakiLuvsU> NOW THAT
[4:29:38] <KnivesEve> yes 100%
[4:29:39] <%Dakuu75> he gets his arm back?!
[4:29:39] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I mean in the dialogue choice I said kill her.
[4:29:39] <+GingerSen> kind of help in that throne room crisis however
[4:29:40] <%ClericOfSparda> I saw Arenvald come in like "Yo What up?" and I was just like "Ok."
[4:29:40] <%KineticZen> Can't side with a bunch of grinning cretins stoning a couple to death
[4:29:40] <MrDrayko> that's why what happens in bozja, happens @PatStaresAt
[4:29:40] <theworsttimelime> back when he had 2 arms FeelsBadMan
[4:29:41] <HimakiLuvsU> THAT RIGHT THERE
[4:29:41] <nisekei> LIKE WITH THE OTHER ANTAGONIST WHO IS BETTER RIGHT?
[4:29:42] <%kainhighwind1990> I HATE PIPPIN
[4:29:42] <HimakiLuvsU> NO
[4:29:42] <joodatious> boooo!!!
[4:29:43] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Arenvald should have gotten more screentime so  we could connect with him more
[4:29:43] <nevan_44> LUL
[4:29:44] <haisho> unfortunately Fake Echo is too useful
[4:29:45] <Balsty> shinryu is a fun trial
[4:29:47] <28moogles> boo
[4:29:47] <%shadowsofpain> bad take but it's your opinion at the end of the day
[4:29:47] <Daxalog> Oh so thats what the fights really look like
[4:29:48] <+starlorb3> GO BACK TO BEING YDA LYSE
[4:29:48] <%averyoddjew> oh man remember when he had that arm?
[4:29:48] <$SGrim> Least Hexed
[4:29:49] <LoreKeeper_Thal> no you don't
[4:29:51] <%senorpapel> “Don’t spend enough time with them.” Story of stormblood
[4:29:52] <%ShawnTK_> shut up Lyse
[4:29:52] <+SladeClegane> Realistically yeah, but that’s an awful story beat you’re proposing
[4:29:53] <+OneGorillionDollars> But a sad backstory makes everything you do okay! Thats why everyone seems alright with emet selch
[4:29:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat just wants everyone to die
[4:29:53] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> too hard for the normies
[4:29:54] <+TheCityBeast> THIS EXTREME WAS FUN
[4:29:55] <Maverick2736> NOW FIGHT A FUCKING DRAGON
[4:29:55] <+emoprawn> @PatStaresAt Whats going to be the quickest way to level sage to endwalker content ?
[4:29:56] <Coconosuga> I am least heads
[4:29:56] <%BoxNavy> dont care + didnt ask + youre lyse
[4:29:56] <+Talimity> i cleared this twice and never again
[4:29:57] <HimakiLuvsU> SHINRYU TOO HARD?!!?!?
[4:29:58] <%CalderGaming> i started playing at 5.3 and beelined MSQ so arenvald was still relatively fresh in my mind from 2.x
[4:29:59] <skullneedles> you liberated this? *I* liberated this.
[4:30:00] <Theoretic101> Boooo LYse
[4:30:00] <%DianaTheAscian> Its cool though
[4:30:01] <Dang0> nah Fordolas great
[4:30:01] <+Greywyn00> I love running up the tail
[4:30:02] <%shadowsofpain> best Ex
[4:30:02] <+EternalInquisitor> shut the fuck up Lyse!
[4:30:03] <HimakiLuvsU> SHINRYU EX IS TOO HARD?!?!?
[4:30:03] <UnduexKaGo> ohhhhh yeah UCoB
[4:30:03] <gryffinp> I really like the bit at the end of Stormblood where Rhauban tells you "Hey if you find Zenos you fucking KILL him, no prisoners." and then after he kills himself while lyse and alphinaud beg him to stop, Rhauban walks in and goes "FUCKING GOOD"
[4:30:04] <+other_badger> least hexed scion:
[4:30:04] <%RocketBarrel> Ultimate!
[4:30:06] <%KineticZen> UWU time
[4:30:06] <Cosairen> UCOB
[4:30:07] <bbbbuttts1> was shinryu ex a savage
[4:30:07] <%croxeye> UCOB
[4:30:08] <Balsty> shinryu EX as blu mage is actually fun as fuck
[4:30:10] <%commanderapathy> Fordola can suck a FAT dick
[4:30:10] <Warbot40> Fake Echo is WAY TOO useful to just kill fordola even if she deserves it
[4:30:10] <%GelatinBoi> UCOB woo
[4:30:10] <%DianaTheAscian> ULTIMATE
[4:30:12] <BlueEagle2395> yo this was first ultimate
[4:30:12] <thunderborn32> ya know the resistance that she REFUSED TO LEAD
[4:30:12] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> UCOB
[4:30:13] <%LaughingCatt> UCoB
[4:30:13] <%kysath> UCOB
[4:30:14] <+poco_loco2> Fuck UCoB with a passion
[4:30:14] <LoreKeeper_Thal> UCOB!
[4:30:15] <theworsttimelime> is this UCOB?
[4:30:15] <%KineticZen> UCOB excuse me
[4:30:15] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> "I am Lyse Hext and I don't get to do anything."
[4:30:15] <Linkster720> UCOB
[4:30:16] <Anubis> UCOB BABY
[4:30:18] <+Ghazarban> aw shiet, UCoB
[4:30:19] <%BoxNavy> da oocob
[4:30:20] <lindadeann> She did not die
[4:30:20] <Ginganinja4545> If i hear Lyse speak once in 6.0 itll be too much
[4:30:22] <BobbyHopp> tail bridge platforming gameplay
[4:30:22] <HimakiLuvsU> ucob
[4:30:26] <+teca78> They really got studio glibly for this music lmao
[4:30:26] <+GingerSen> CUM
[4:30:26] <Balsty> UCOB sucked, worst ult
[4:30:27] <SerpentScintilla> holy fuck woke up early because the cat needed food, good thing though 10gb patch
[4:30:30] <%senorpapel> @patstaresat  who is harder. Shinryu ex or thordan ex?
[4:30:31] <Maverick2736> CUM, THEN
[4:30:33] <%KineticZen> RIVAL WINGS YEAH
[4:30:35] <%StaceMcGate> ????
[4:30:38] <UnduexKaGo> Rival Wings is p good
[4:30:38] <%StaceMcGate> but they're fun
[4:30:38] <theworsttimelime> oh this pvp mode is dead
[4:30:40] <%BigCoffee> you don't like ff5 and ff6?
[4:30:41] <beloverly> ucob deez nuts CoolCat
[4:30:42] <$EsotericOdyssey> The only part of Fordola's presence I liked at all was when she saw the WoL's past in previous expansions and she realized her problems were baby bitch shit
[4:30:42] <+starlorb3> Not even Kefka
[4:30:42] <Trinity5> OMEGA F COOM
[4:30:42] <Balsty> OKAY RIVAL WINGS KINDA FUN TBH
[4:30:43] <+Havictos> But Kefka?
[4:30:43] <HawkHollywood> do you think we'll be able to solo Stormblood EX trials at 90?
[4:30:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> i love Phantom Train but that's it
[4:30:44] <%RocketBarrel> Not even God Kefka?
[4:30:44] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt not even o8s?
[4:30:45] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is an UCOB
[4:30:46] <LoreKeeper_Thal> not even Exdeath and Kefka?
[4:30:47] <%GelatinBoi> Exdeath was a cool Savage fight but fair enough
[4:30:47] <%EdgeSetter> do ultimates sodaMad
[4:30:47] <NRhyme> LAST ONE BECAUSE OF OMEGA-CHAN, AMIRITE?
[4:30:47] <%InternetShis> Scale and Steel > Worm's Tail
[4:30:48] <%cascadepersona> Even Kefka?
[4:30:49] <WakeUpThrow> I like the fanservice raids
[4:30:49] <HimakiLuvsU> pvp is so dead
[4:30:49] <%LaughingCatt> but there great tho
[4:30:49] <Cosairen> raubahn should have been the main character for ala mhigo
[4:30:50] <+Talimity> skipped sigmascape lul
[4:30:51] <+orochiblood> Omega raids are sick though
[4:30:51] <UnduexKaGo> the one PvP mode that's actually p fun
[4:30:51] <HimakiLuvsU> the deadest
[4:30:51] <%ClericOfSparda> I never did finish the Omega raids
[4:30:52] <GandhiTheTerrible> Kefka?
[4:30:52] <%Monkeyweed21> that Kefka fight fucks tho
[4:30:53] <wretchedautomaton> yeah they're real horny for references until the end
[4:30:54] <+MosesUnspoken> Alpha's a good boy
[4:30:56] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Sigma I liked, but only because Im an FF6 whore
[4:30:56] <toyforus235> ah yes the houseing crisis
[4:30:56] <+Nomenanza> shiroganeeee
[4:30:57] <%commanderapathy> yeah the omega raids weren't really interesting
[4:30:57] <KeiPrime> exdeath and  phantom train?
[4:30:57] <BreakfastSampler> tournament arc + nostalgia jerk = zzzzzz
[4:30:57] <haisho> ah yes
[4:30:58] <+Greywyn00> but Exdeath savage is so cool
[4:31:00] <livi242> exdeath Savage as the best
[4:31:00] <+BIumen> @Saltmeisterr the first ultimate raid
[4:31:02] <Latija> this was my first patch launch
[4:31:02] <haisho> the place with all the homeless

[4:31:09] <+LordBleckZ> exdeath still has one of the coolest transitions
[4:31:09] <%TeepPhoenix> Is this when they let Bards play music?
[4:31:09] <MayShip> fuck those fish people
[4:31:10] <%baka_sugoi> fish
[4:31:12] <%ClericOfSparda> I MISS THE MANDERVILLE QUESTS
[4:31:13] <%JohnAtDawn> Who the fuck likes ucob? It’s the worst designed ult, jank as shit
[4:31:14] <theworsttimelime> O________O

[4:31:30] <%InternetShis> BEST ALLIANCE
[4:31:30] <%commanderapathy> yes
[4:31:31] <%TeepPhoenix> the third one was the best
[4:31:31] <lindadeann> Hehe
[4:31:31] <gryffinp> I liked the Dark Apocalypse raids, because they were raids full of references to games I had played, as opposed to every other raid series, which is full of references to final fantasy games I had not played
[4:31:32] <Ash_Harden> The final fight of the last raid is so goood
[4:31:32] <%LaughingCatt> ah yes Rabanastre. Or as they called it, Rabanasty
[4:31:32] <%Frost_Quill> I'm still sad Catboi-Zenos never followed us to the First.
[4:31:32] <cassiusbright1157> Ivalice raids are S tier
[4:31:32] <SerpentScintilla> MATH SUCKS
[4:31:33] <+Greywyn00> these are so cool
[4:31:33] <Balsty> S+ TIER RAIDS
[4:31:33] <28moogles> these raids suck lmao
[4:31:34] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Ivalice is easily the best of the Alliance raids
[4:31:34] <Linkster720> best 24 mans
[4:31:34] <KeiPrime> RAbaNASTY
[4:31:34] <GandhiTheTerrible> IVALICE
[4:31:34] <%donaghy> getting to hang wiht midgarsomir in omega again is rad
[4:31:35] <RittiFruity> Icalice is still best 24 man raid

[4:31:36] <%asgard147> limesYay

[4:31:37] <Tonberry46> BEST RAIDS
[4:31:37] <%ThirdWelles> Mustadio best boss
[4:31:38] <+Anaguma_no_Koe> YEYEYEYEYEEEE
[4:31:38] <roobanguy> i just wish these raids had new remade music
[4:31:38] <VAYETEAS> These raids are just scenery porn
[4:31:39] <%GelatinBoi> I JUST WISH THE QUEUE TIME FOR THESE WEREN'T SO BAD
[4:31:39] <%commanderapathy> Y E S YES
[4:31:39] <Cosairen> BEST ALLIANCES BY FAR
[4:31:40] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> FFT AND FF12 HYPE
[4:31:40] <%Monkeyweed21> THE BEST ALLIANCE RAIDS UP TO THIS POINT
[4:31:40] <%thebeargoesHONK> this and southern front..... A++++
[4:31:40] <%BigCoffee> Orlandu sucks
[4:31:40] <+MosesUnspoken> So much lore
[4:31:41] <WakeUpThrow> Still the best raids in the game!
[4:31:41] <Warbot40> Fake Ramza sucks tho
[4:31:41] <BlueTunicLink> 24 and 8 man raids in SB are the best part of SB
[4:31:41] <nisekei> great raids the story can go straight to hell
[4:31:42] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I hate the gear though not single piece I liked the look of
[4:31:42] <+FZeroDMX> Ivalice raids are GOATed
[4:31:42] <bbbbuttts1> where do you rank nier
[4:31:43] <%LaughingCatt> they are phenomenal
[4:31:43] <%InternetShis> NO ONE PLAYS EM BUT STILL THE BEST
[4:31:44] <sa_turns> ridorana wipehouse!
[4:31:45] <%nanaki_ff14> Best Alliance Raids
[4:31:45] <+GingerSen> To bad the tower takes all
[4:31:46] <thesweatiest> Best music in the game isn't even XIV music
[4:31:46] <livi242> nier was such a letdown
[4:31:47] <%DianaTheAscian> I need to play fft so I can understand this raid story
[4:31:48] <+orochiblood> CIDOLFUS ORLANDEAU.. YOUR JOURNEY ENDS HERE
[4:31:48] <+FinetiSonata> yep, hard to contest that
[4:31:49] <%PatNTheHat> Had to grind Orbonne for my dragoon glamour, only hated myself a little bit
[4:31:50] <+ArticPath> Hours of dialog to unlock
[4:31:50] <gryffinp> I like the actual raid missions but the story line caused me physical pain
[4:31:50] <+Wolfstriker121> this one was based on ff tactics?
[4:31:51] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I want Explorer mode to get added to the alliance raids so bad
[4:31:51] <NRhyme> All the boss designs are gross!
[4:31:52] <%JoshManVGH> Dalmasca is such a goddamn cool city
[4:31:52] <+poco_loco2> I wish the Nier raids were as good as Ivalice raids
[4:31:52] <dan_g_v> perfect for FF12 fans
[4:31:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Math is easy chat, stop being dumb, learn yoir PRIME NUMBERS
[4:31:57] <%croxeye> too bad they super retcon FFT tho
[4:31:57] <metalsiren31> Yeah probably the best alliance raid series as a whole
[4:31:57] <ValkahRoctsteel> Ivalice is the best FF setting
[4:31:59] <+lojack69> just gotta try and look past the part where they ruined FFTs story
[4:32:01] <Huntercd> When is Spira?
[4:32:02] <mikesapartment> I love the smt4 designs
[4:32:03] <lindadeann> But not fact yet?
[4:32:03] <+RelikaNox> I loved the raids but honestly as someone who never played FFT, the story bored me to tears
[4:32:04] <%thebeargoesHONK> worst side characters
[4:32:04] <Cosairen> i can be balthier though :)
[4:32:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I still think that man looks like Owen Wilson
[4:32:05] <%ThirdWelles> if only more idiots knew how to do basic math
[4:32:06] <%LaughingCatt> if they gear was dyable itd be fantastic
[4:32:06] <+lojack69> everything else about em is fantastic
[4:32:06] <%shadowsofpain> very verbose in there story delivery though
[4:32:06] <zerointelligence000> boat
[4:32:07] <+SladeClegane> Great raids with story that makes me want to die
[4:32:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> YEAYEAYEA
[4:32:09] <NRhyme> And I hated the fucking troupe
[4:32:09] <%KineticZen> Prime numbers and simple division so hard
[4:32:11] <DAIHIME> remember, 1 doesn't count as a prime number
[4:32:11] <Dang0> i like the ivalice raids, but I found the quests super boring
[4:32:12] <HimakiLuvsU> Nier raids, surprisingly lackluster
[4:32:13] <%Wulfphelz> Aether being able to store Memories and Emotions is pretty dope, wonder how we'll see that concept return :)
[4:32:13] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt why can't people math
[4:32:14] <Tonberry46> AHKIHIKO YOSIDA THE GOAT
[4:32:14] <%RocketBarrel> I really hope next alliance raid tops Ivalice. Nier left such a bad taste
[4:32:15] <%asgard147> YOU SHOW PROMISE, BUT PROMISE WON'T SAVE YOU FROM WHAT COMES NEXT!
[4:32:16] <+Kyma1020> at least you could cosplay Agrias
[4:32:19] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> i lost all the damn marbels when i first saw this trailer with the Tactics music
[4:32:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> S TIER
[4:32:19] <Tonberry46> BEST CHARACTER ARTIST
[4:32:20] <%TITOtheGamingGod> TITOtheGamingGod subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! what is you opinion on Zenos and how has it changed throughout the game.
[4:32:20] <UnduexKaGo> the voice acting in Orbonne really sells it
[4:32:22] <+Ghazarban> There's Ramza just fucking there
[4:32:22] <+Akabane101> It took me forever just to figure out the math game changed my HP value LUL
[4:32:23] <Warbot40> Fuck fake Ramza
[4:32:23] <%senorpapel> Ivalice raids are dope. But glams aren’t my thing
[4:32:24] <+Talimity> wow was the key art really the ivalice shit?
[4:32:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Ramza's descendants suck tho
[4:32:26] <$EsotericOdyssey> OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE DARKNESS AND DROWN IN ITS LOVELESS EMBRACE; THE GODS WILL *NOT* BE WATCHING
[4:32:26] <+BIumen> Okay but why was it called The Legend Returns
[4:32:26] <GandhiTheTerrible> RAMZA
[4:32:27] <BaeSoora> the gear is ass
[4:32:28] <theworsttimelime> the story was super fanservice and I LOVED it
[4:32:28] <quetzalcoatlusart> Everyone dying on the first boss of Dun Scaith tho in Duty Finder is the funniest shit tho.
[4:32:30] <+Havictos> @lojack69 That's weird I don't remember it being ruined at all
[4:32:31] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @croxeye is it really a retcon if it was written by the same writer?
[4:32:35] <LadyWyvernne> I couldn't believe how easy the math boss was after all the hype.
[4:32:36] <lindadeann> Need more proof
[4:32:36] <jorniev> ivalice?
[4:32:40] <gryffinp> Custom deliveries are good
[4:32:42] <HimakiLuvsU> B Tier
[4:32:42] <livi242> 4.1 was when I started
[4:32:42] <NRhyme> SERIOUSLY?!
[4:32:42] <%JoshManVGH> That stupid skyship always being in Kugane fucking sucks though
[4:32:43] <thesweatiest> Sounds like a legit patch honestly
[4:32:44] <BobbyHopp> we need more ivalice in XIV
[4:32:46] <Trinity5> BARD SHIT LETS GO
[4:32:46] <%BoxNavy> performance wasnt until sb? damn
[4:32:47] <%CzeekyTV> Stormblood had CRAZY amounts of side content
[4:32:47] <+Cacti_Israphe> best patch of shb
[4:32:48] <%BigCoffee> The Ivalice raids suck because they acknowledge ff12 and change and FFT storyline into something worst. And the boss design sucks because it's based on the god awful ff12 things instead of the FFT monsters.
[4:32:50] <+nikoloas_> holy shit
[4:32:52] <HimakiLuvsU> B
[4:32:55] <citerel> people wanted perform for a while

[4:33:01] <HimakiLuvsU> wooooooooooooooo
[4:33:03] <majindusto> Not actually  Ramza enigmaCry
[4:33:05] <Dang0> ivalice was the only time i even consired skipping cutscenes
[4:33:07] <BreakfastSampler> @croxeye also nothing is a retcon because everything is referrential, nothing is The Actual Thing
[4:33:07] <%DianaTheAscian> Yeah its alright
[4:33:10] <theworsttimelime> yoooo cross world friends is great
[4:33:10] <nisekei> i was a new healer for the last part of the ivalice raids and the other healer was super passive aggressive every single time i died and no one bothered explaining what was happeneing even though i started the raid by saying "i'm new" and i have an exceptional grudge against it
[4:33:20] <lindadeann> C
[4:33:26] <gryffinp> interesting choice

[4:36:26] <%BigCoffee> eureka is the worst thing they ever did
[4:36:27] <gryffinp> when I did that plot arc I was using the Tekko #55 glamour, which meant that Asahi was wearing the white version of an outfit I was wearing the black version of, which frankly is more symbolism than he deserves

[4:37:31] <gryffinp> @Ciglossonjr same, would have been much more interesting. But nuance is bad, so actually the empire exists purely to cause apocalypses

[4:52:01] <%asgard147> So the next one's an S right Pat?
[4:52:02] <wretchedautomaton> i've been jebaited
[4:52:06] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> especially considering Stormblood's start
[4:52:08] <cinnamosandalwo> I'm looking forward to all those not-MSQ blue bubbles in the 6.0 downtime 🌝
[4:52:09] <%SolumFuturae> BLU could have been a real class nyannSadge
[4:52:10] <matouci> Not just Eureka, Baldesion Arsenal. Half the reason anyone bothered with Eureka in the end
[4:52:10] <+doctor_brofessor> but then, 5.0 happened, blowing stormblood out of the water
[4:52:11] <+Talimity> stormblood patch content was better than the msq lol
[4:52:13] <+EriksBlue> :C
[4:52:13] <NRhyme> I'D RELOCK IVALICE RAIDS IF I COULD
[4:52:14] <%senorpapel> @ciglossonjr  same. I didn’t do the ivalice raids until i realized i needed to for bozja
[4:52:14] <$ONotation> Technically Stormblood hasn't been resolved?
[4:52:17] <%Aeoneth> I wonder where this next one is gonna go
[4:52:18] <HimakiLuvsU> woooooooooooooooooooooooo
[4:52:19] <+heiro001> pee pee time
[4:52:20] <Vermillion129> Which patch is gear of change again?
[4:52:20] <%crimsonharvest> makin pee
[4:52:20] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> SB patches are all great and so much setup for SHB
[4:52:23] <%Faustgesicht> 5.0 and 5.3 easy S's
[4:52:23] <citerel> here comes a lot of S's
[4:52:25] <dan_g_v> another F tier
[4:52:25] <+Ghazarban> S tier it Donzo
[4:52:26] <+heiro001> S across the board
[4:52:26] <+Drigoooooo> F tier
[4:52:27] <%W1nterTitan> Real easy
[4:52:29] <+takotoots> LUL
[4:52:30] <Trinity5> all in A or S lmao
[4:52:31] <%walternatorz> S B S S S
[4:52:34] <blackjack8182> I wanna see more tier lists
[4:52:34] <%W1nterTitan> 5.3
[4:52:35] <%JoshManVGH> SHB time!!
[4:52:35] <tukds> Lots of F's
[4:52:36] <cinnamosandalwo> relock ivalice lmaooo
[4:52:36] <+trifecta89> S EZ
[4:52:36] <%kainhighwind1990> 4.5 seems ALOT less SB and alot more ShB, moresoe than 3.5 being proto-SB
[4:52:38] <%Wulfphelz> the easiest LUL
[4:52:39] <+FZeroDMX> Lmao run the top of the list
[4:52:41] <zerointelligence000> S for Shadowbringers
[4:52:43] <theworsttimelime> clearly all same tier as 1.0
[4:52:47] <calboku> s tier was created for shb
[4:52:50] <NRhyme> ShB gets its own tier list since it's in another world
[4:52:50] <Trinity5> 5.1 prob ends up the lowest yeah
[4:52:59] <Warbot40> A and S across the board it seems
[4:53:00] <+Talimity> 5.4 is the only one i was meh on
[4:53:15] <%BoxNavy> chjbDance
[4:53:22] <KrazeArcain> Going to need aa tier on to themselves

[4:53:53] <HimakiLuvsU> ikr
[4:53:57] <+FinetiSonata> SHB is amazing, but the Eden story and Nier stories sucked
[4:53:57] <forumbug74> why is this such a bop
[4:53:58] <gryffinp> is Pat planning to crazy all nighter mode this shit or is he calling it after finishing the tier list
[4:53:59] <Trinity5> @ringabal also congrats
[4:53:59] <%JoshManVGH> I remember finishing 5.4 an saying "That's it?"
[4:54:02] <%senorpapel> @ringabal  it is
[4:54:03] <%Frost_Quill> @ringabal Yes.
[4:54:07] <%StaceMcGate> you could watch all of Jojo Part 6 while waiting
[4:54:09] <Gloppie> MSQ was great across the board, but I felt that Eden had a pretty weak story.
[4:54:11] <%mostbrokenrobo> mostbrokenrobo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey Pat!  What game/series would you want to reboot Realm Reborn style? Dragon apocalypse optional

[4:55:09] <gryffinp> I like the theory that this is what would have happened if Exarch hadn't done his thing, and therefore led to the bad end
[4:55:09] <%BoxNavy> this scene alone makes it the best trailer

[4:57:17] <RushUnplugged> MOMMY
[4:57:18] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> STYLE SWITCHING
[4:57:18] <%averyoddjew> you could in 1.0 apparently
[4:57:19] <+Crimefridge> It would be badass if you could swap classes with a 5 minute cooldown
[4:57:19] <+SladeClegane> That’s… no
[4:57:19] <+takotoots> nyannJam
[4:57:20] <+heiro001> new costumes!
[4:57:20] <+lojack69> still hoping it gets implemented somehow, midcombat class switching
[4:57:20] <%crimsonharvest> oh is this the burning of forest summoners scene?
[4:57:21] <%Frost_Quill> This part made people question if Matoya was gonna take over Y'shtola's body.
[4:57:21] <%TeepPhoenix> TRUE Y'STHOLA
[4:57:21] <Frostydough1> man the day Final Fantasy lets us style switch like DMC THATLL BE THE DAY
[4:57:21] <+FinetiSonata> people are crazy if they thought that was real
[4:57:22] <%asgard147> I best we can against Zodiark limesOwo
[4:57:23] <Calamity2007> I am half expecting FF16 to be like that
[4:57:23] <%Aeoneth> Change to Dragooon as part of you rotation
[4:57:24] <+RaveBV> Would it be more balanced with a cooldown or limit to how many times you can swap?
[4:57:26] <%The_Protagonist> job changing in the overworld mid-battle would be fine
[4:57:26] <%InternetShis> GINTRICKSWORDROYALGUNTRICKSWORDROYAL
[4:57:27] <$ringabal> TIMESKIPS ARE THE BEST

[5:02:40] <+GingerSen> or was it square..
[5:02:41] <+SolGainer> They used a filter
[5:02:41] <+Hertzeil> Innocence theme as the first song in the trailer. Bold.
[5:02:43] <Calamity2007> @KahnWick God damn it you are right. More and more FF4 references

[5:05:39] <%KineticZen> This was followed with the wet fart of Marvel's Avengers at their E3 presentation
[5:05:39] <+Dangerlocker> yes
[5:05:39] <T_Sasquatch> This shit blew my mind
[5:05:40] <%commanderapathy> glad I didn't watch the trailer
[5:05:40] <$ringabal> AND THUS DID MAN MAKE GOD IN THEIR IMAGE
[5:05:41] <+ALazo> Ifrit: "You must be taken already"
[5:05:41] <cinnamosandalwo> How dare they or that stuff in a trailer lmaoo
[5:05:42] <RoxMoxie> So does that mean literally every single living being on Hydaelyn is tempered?
[5:05:42] <+Savarro> I was going through HW at the time and never even caught what that meant
[5:05:43] <+Roundelay11> God, you should never watch these launch trailers before you beat the msq

[5:05:52] <+NYCrownlessKing> They could of took out the two words "of primals" and that last scene would still be sick @PatStaresAt
[5:05:52] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @tukds because it's a jrpg
[5:05:52] <jja8020> to be fair he drops a bigger lore dump a couple of voice lines later
[5:05:53] <%TeepPhoenix> Do you guys remember the ads with Tom Holland advertising Shadowbringers?  And he was trying to become the WOD?
[5:05:53] <Augus7717> true LUL
[5:05:53] <%Chichen> THATS A GOOD WAY OF PUTTIN IT
[5:05:53] <+other_badger> @tukds are they supposed to have a hentai protagonist in the trailer or something?
[5:05:53] <NRhyme> That's why I watched none of these until I finished everything story related.
[5:05:53] <%walternatorz> YUP
[5:05:57] <+Talimity> @king_wragles you should probably stop watching immediately lmao
[5:05:58] <+natjen8> they spoiled that because everyone at the time already suspected hydaelyn and zodiark were primals
[5:06:01] <%Wulfphelz> That wasn't even the biggest bombshell in the expansion
[5:06:02] <%TheAntiNihilist> how is that a spoiler. duh. obviously they're primals. especially if you played ff12
[5:06:04] <theworsttimelime> the ENTIRE expansion was great from start to finish
[5:06:04] <%TeepPhoenix> That was right when a Spider-Man movie came out
[5:06:05] <%ElkRiverDog> Note to self: never watch a launch trailer
[5:06:06] <%Maids4lyfe> SilverNoted

[5:11:25] <livi242> diamond was mine
[5:11:26] <Calamity2007> Gaius being bad dad
[5:11:26] <+Savarro> Yeeaaah this is probably my favorite trial series
[5:11:27] <%Agami23> when did the fishing boat get added in? because thats what actually got me to start and stick with ff14
[5:11:27] <+NYCrownlessKing> a GUNDAM
[5:11:28] <Latija> diamond sucked
[5:11:29] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt I feel like thats the case for most 3 trial sets. First one best, last one worst
[5:11:30] <bbbbuttts1> probably
[5:11:30] <%TeepPhoenix> And NAEL VAN DARNUS!
[5:11:30] <mr_mister0> DIADEM
[5:11:31] <+Adalore> Wish tehre was a little more harder plot in the weapons plot. IT ALMOST DID SOME HARD SHIT and then didn't.
[5:11:31] <peyodogo> i mean it checks out considering
[5:11:32] <%nichos7> They blew their load super early with Ruby
[5:11:32] <%Monkeyweed21> I loved Emerald
[5:11:33] <Sol_Install> Now i can only fucking hear "tacos"
[5:11:33] <%InternetShis> Sapphire never gets love
[5:11:35] <Fathuran> First time I heard that. Is it because the pilots turn into yummy taco meat for the oversoul?
[5:11:35] <cassiusbright1157> Anamnesis is a pretty solid dungeon

[5:11:57] <+Greywyn00> I LIKED THEM
[5:12:00] <%ashenfrenzy> i really liked the ifrit/garuda one
[5:12:00] <NRhyme> Gaia was cute, though
[5:12:01] <+heiro001> shiva remix song was good
[5:12:02] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Twice Stricken SLAPS
[5:12:02] <VAYETEAS> But the implications of EDEN tho
[5:12:02] <UnduexKaGo> E7 is bad, I like the other 3 tho.
[5:12:02] <Warbot40> Fair enough
[5:12:02] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt yeah but is has lesbians in its storyline so like
[5:12:02] <%MrP33Ps> Eden Savage is great
[5:12:03] <$Futurecity10> Nah fuck off Eden was tight
[5:12:03] <+poco_loco2> Eden has new enemies tho
[5:12:03] <%Noir_Valdr> I like Gaia
[5:12:04] <$EsotericOdyssey> you know
[5:12:05] <%Noir_Valdr> lol
[5:12:05] <+DoctorDerp388> GOTH GF
[5:12:06] <%Faustgesicht> Ocean fishing tho
[5:12:06] <wretchedautomaton> yeah i was annoyed that they were rehashes but shiva was very fun
[5:12:06] <%InternetShis> SHIVA THO
[5:12:07] <+FZeroDMX> Most of Eden is ehh, but Titan rules
[5:12:07] <%CzeekyTV> Eden's Promise were all unique
[5:12:07] <%Zundelle> the fight mechanics were real cool but I just want completely new weird shit
[5:12:07] <Calamity2007> Brain damaged WoL
[5:12:08] <LoreKeeper_Thal> it was worth for the remixes
[5:12:08] <toyforus235> but ff8 musuc
[5:12:08] <peyodogo> EDEN SO GOOD LESBIANS GAY BIG GAY
[5:12:08] <+RelikaNox> E8's music was a BANGER tho
[5:12:10] <+dujam> MQS for 5.2 was fucking fire
[5:12:10] <+StryderStrikesAt> I'm still waiting for Gaia's outfit to be on the Mogstation
[5:12:10] <+FinetiSonata> some Eden fights are good but the story wasn't great
[5:12:10] <Cosairen> EDEN SHIVA IS STILL THE COOLEST FIGHT
[5:12:11] <Sol_Install> THEY WERE COOL
[5:12:11] <HimakiLuvsU> Yshtola alive for a sixth time
[5:12:13] <%RealThiele> omega tho
[5:12:14] <citerel> eden 8 is great
[5:12:15] <Sydin18> They were still kickass as hell
[5:12:15] <+dujam> *MSQ
[5:12:16] <HimakiLuvsU> THE MUSIC
[5:12:17] <%ClericOfSparda> I'm pretty sure Titan was a car.
[5:12:17] <%BoxNavy> chjbDance
[5:12:18] <Dang0> I like those two but thats a fair complaint
[5:12:18] <+EdHeng> the gear was cool tho
[5:12:19] <+lojack69> its the worst story in the game pretty sure
[5:12:19] <+Katmon27> omega was great, eden was meh
[5:12:20] <+Savarro> As a HUGE FF8 mark I went crazy for the Eden stuff
[5:12:22] <%velemi> eden is half new stuff
[5:12:22] <theworsttimelime> coxJam
[5:12:22] <%JoshManVGH> The WoLs terrible memory! "Remember when Titan was a car?"
[5:12:25] <NRhyme> For her to bear?
[5:12:26] <Klonoa__> Alexander has liiike 4 or 5 good ones and some that are just nothing
[5:12:26] <%Frost_Quill> Ifrit and Garuda fusion-dancing was great.
[5:12:27] <+fugatlas> oh hey its testuya nomura lady
[5:12:27] <$ringabal> FOR TOMOOOOOOOOOROW
[5:12:28] <+justianxix> I like how much of the raid series are references
[5:12:29] <%KineticZen> Is this where this sub-boss music showed up
[5:12:29] <+Talimity> this was sick
[5:12:31] <+rando_0268> Bozja
[5:12:32] <+Ghazarban> All of Alex things except Cruise, Brute Justice and Alex himself are samey
[5:12:34] <%CzeekyTV> Also, Titan riding a go-kart is amazing
[5:12:35] <gryffinp> RyneXGaia is boring and bad and people onlike it it because they're suckers for representation
[5:12:35] <wretchedautomaton> this is when they changed the mid-boss theme
[5:12:36] <theworsttimelime> BOZJA
[5:12:36] <raineedaydreams> coxJam
[5:12:37] <%GarbageNirvana> So does that mean you're not gonna like Lahabrea
[5:12:37] <+jing_da> Omega was the best kinda fan service as a FF5 fan.
[5:12:38] <%cascadepersona> Alex got kinda samey with the Goblins and Mechs
[5:12:38] <%GelatinBoi> Cidception
[5:12:38] <%walternatorz> memoria?

[5:12:40] <%Ninestempest> memoria miseria?
[5:12:42] <+Adalore> Did you check the weather in there, it was "Delirium"
[5:12:42] <+EdHeng> SO GOOD
[5:12:42] <+FinetiSonata> I hated that EX fight though
[5:12:42] <+kepazhe> varis extreme was my favorite fight i think
[5:12:44] <%KineticZen> What a bassline
[5:12:44] <%Valdorick> ITS A TRUST TRIAL, ITS AMAZING
[5:12:44] <%Chichen> fuck memoria all my homies hate memoria

[5:12:56] <+RaveBV> lip
[5:12:56] <TheSkeep> sickest part of bozja so of course you only do it once
[5:12:56] <GilliamYaeger> I wish Memoria Miseria was a dungeon.
[5:12:57] <$ONotation> Mindblowing how Memoria Miseria  doesn't exist for anything else
[5:12:57] <Archmortal> I wish people farmed the EX for the dyeable class armor more
[5:12:57] <%greasypete00> PAIGE
[5:12:58] <+heiro001> elidibus is a dick
[5:12:59] <%senorpapel> Bozja is cool as shit

[5:13:06] <Klonoa__> I actually really enjoyed Bozja and I didn't think I would
[5:13:07] <ElementalX1000> Primals version of Insatiable
[5:13:08] <+NYCrownlessKing> Varis trial was the least memorable for me tbh @PatStaresAt
[5:13:09] <calboku> bozja sucks ass
[5:13:11] <+SiameseDuck> Zenos fucks
[5:13:11] <%walternatorz> everyone gets the echo
[5:13:12] <+heiro001> lol Zenos keeping that costume for a few patches and then dropping it for reaper
[5:13:12] <RoxMoxie> I really wish Gaia was done better. I just didn't care about her.
[5:13:14] <+dujam> SUCH A BAIT WITH DALAMUD I REMEMBER THAT
[5:13:16] <HimakiLuvsU> that top is so fucking amazing
[5:13:19] <HimakiLuvsU> the captain cloak
[5:13:20] <%Valdorick> So, Zenos is just the sound, right?
[5:13:21] <%averyoddjew> zenos literally being evil goku
[5:13:23] <%valriot> JUICY ZENOS
[5:13:23] <+superrhubarbpie> im so excited to murder zenos for good
[5:13:24] <Archmortal> 1.0 fucking foreshadowed this so hard I can't even believe it
[5:13:25] <NRhyme> I wanted to kill Elidibus so hard. Don't even care he's a child or some shit
[5:13:26] <+Talimity> monkaS
[5:13:27] <LordDudeTheFirst> This is where I started playing
[5:13:29] <%justacrow84> Wish Zenos kept that outfit
[5:13:29] <Anubis> I cant believe Zenos got 2 outfit changes in shadowbringers
[5:13:31] <lindadeann> Elidibus 1st warrior of light
[5:13:33] <cinnamosandalwo> yaaaaaas
[5:13:33] <@ssjklyco> A lot of Space vibes in Shadow Bringers
[5:13:34] <+MashinChaserR> ere
[5:13:34] <%nichos7> God this remix slaps tho
[5:13:36] <+heiro001> shut up Elidibus
[5:13:37] <+fugatlas> wasn't this one fishing
[5:13:37] <%ShawnTK_> and then covid happened
[5:13:39] <gryffinp> Its weird how uncermoniously lahabrea and elidibus got offed, compared to how much buildup they had
[5:13:42] <+EdHeng> Zenos stands from chair
[5:13:42] <%walternatorz> new game plus?
[5:13:42] <%CalderGaming> bozja was 5.1
[5:13:43] <$GameOverDeo> numbers just keep going up
[5:13:44] <%cascadepersona> BOzja
[5:13:47] <%croxeye> diadem turned into gatherers paradise??
[5:13:48] <+Adalore> That part also went "AND THIS IS THE ECHO REALLY IS" is it was just PLOT
[5:13:49] <%BoxNavy> elidibus' VA is stellar
[5:13:49] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> You mean goku black
[5:13:50] <%CalderGaming> or 5.2?
[5:13:52] <mortificent> Bozja
[5:13:55] <+heiro001> Azem is the 1st warrior of light, Elidibus just copied them
[5:14:02] <%CzeekyTV> @gryffinp Well hold on, what's that about Lahabread? Kappa
[5:14:03] <+heiro001> forever a poser
[5:14:04] <Thenuclearwalrus> Low A
[5:14:08] <%TeepPhoenix> We're going to kick Zenos out into space like Kars in Jojo Part 2
[5:14:11] <HimakiLuvsU> High B
[5:14:13] <+other_badger> @gryffinp I wouldn't say elidibus was "unceremonious"
[5:14:13] <+mitzieter> what does he have at the bottom?
[5:14:15] <+Adalore> Echo reveal is going to stick with me
[5:14:15] <+fugatlas> god remember when 5.2 came out and people were afraid the SHB relic would be TOO easy?
[5:14:16] <%Valdorick> Do not think about the fact that Zenos likely had a fucking Glam session everytime he tried a new class.
[5:14:17] <gryffinp> @gryffinp its just gonna be a recording of him

[5:30:51] <%CzeekyTV> He was raised as a weapon, that's it
[5:30:54] <%skycladbrent> TRUST FINDER ZENOS
[5:30:54] <%Valdorick> ZENOS FOR THE TRUST SYSTEM
[5:30:55] <lindadeann> Azem is the sun
[5:30:56] <+doctor_brofessor> I have some bad news for you
[5:30:58] <+heiro001> If Zenos is Hythlodaeus I will go insane
[5:30:58] <%crimsonharvest> zenos will be your kohai
[5:31:00] <%boxboten> i swear to god if he gets a tragic childhood or some shit
[5:31:01] <%averyoddjew> big agree
[5:31:02] <Xeno045> yea don't Jiren his ass
[5:31:03] <+Vyndicator> leave zenos and his Murder boner alone
[5:31:03] <cinnamosandalwo> not sure how they can save his character
[5:31:04] <Anubis> they gave him a backstory that makes his dad seem worse but other than that
[5:31:05] <+FinetiSonata> have him sit along on the Naruto swing
[5:31:06] <%SlackerAlex> He gets a Nauto swing
[5:31:06] <+StrikeTheErf> yeah, that's called Yotsuyu and it sucked then too
[5:31:11] <mortificent> Yeah, don't Netflix Vicious him
[5:31:11] <+CaptainJax> He's gotta love just being an asshole for no reason
[5:31:12] <nisekei> he should JUST be an asshole big agree
[5:31:12] <+EagleCeres> @PatStaresAt he already has a back story... he's just too perfect for this imperfect world
[5:31:13] <%Agami23> double down on zenos' crazy shit and make him show up in the crafter quests to try and outcraft the WoL
[5:31:16] <lindadeann> You are the sun
[5:31:17] <+Savarro> They've got a ton of work to do if they're gonna redeem Zenos
[5:31:17] <cinnamosandalwo> Cut to Zenos sitting on a swing
[5:31:20] <T_Sasquatch> You mean THE thing that already EXISTS
[5:31:22] <theanora1> he is Emet's Grandson, that will mess you up
[5:31:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Even assholes are people, Pat
[5:31:22] <+SolGainer> There's already a short story on the website about Zenos that is his backstory
[5:31:22] <cassiusbright1157> I honestly hope the just keep Zenos and Fandaniel as a chaotic evil.
[5:31:22] <%ThirdWelles> Show him being a deranged sociopath as a teenager and his family being afraid of him. No other flashbacks
[5:31:23] <+Crimefridge> I really wish they didn't have xenos slit his own throat when he wanted a rematch in the first place
[5:31:24] <+Nomenanza> "he was the coolest guy!"
[5:31:26] <%Valdorick> What if Zenos gets Tsuyu'd?
[5:31:28] <%JohnAtDawn> They already did that though? There’s a side story about it
[5:31:28] <%commanderapathy> Oh god! We should've known it was GACKT all along!
[5:31:28] <%justacrow84> There was a story. He was always an ass
[5:31:30] <lindadeann> Venat is your wife
[5:31:32] <Phob05> Zenos couldnt even get on the swing because his ass was so juicy
[5:31:32] <+supersonic21> zenos just turns into majima
[5:31:34] <NRhyme> ZENOS THE FINAL BOSS OF MAHJONG
[5:31:34] <+heiro001> Zenos is just not that interesting compared to Emet and Elidibus
[5:31:40] <Sol_Install> I see Zenos get that Satan from Devilmaycare baby treatment tbh
[5:31:42] <MKII> Why are you like this Zenos? "MOTHEEER"
[5:31:48] <%PatNTheHat> Who's gonna die tho??
[5:31:49] <Vermillion129> I dont mind zenos just being insane, i just want him to go out in blaze of glory
[5:31:51] <+SolGainer> @Crimefridge he only wanted a rematch because he lived through the suicide
[5:31:52] <%cascadepersona> Zenos is totally gonna have like a solo instance, I feel
[5:31:55] <+doctor_brofessor> It makes it make sense but isn't a redemption, it it an explanation of how we got to where we met him
[5:31:55] <+heiro001> I'm more interested in the Ascian shades than Zenos and Fandaniel
[5:31:57] <mortalmanbaby> combat zexual
[5:31:57] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> They made Elidibus an actual character so im eager to see what they do with Zenos
[5:32:01] <lindadeann> Twin’s momis hydelyn’s newheart
[5:32:02] <Ciglossonjr> @PatStaresAt I just realized there isn't a single goddamn Au Ra on the First, what's up with that
[5:32:03] <ogyeezus_> 3 hours 30 minutes folks <3

[5:32:08] <%RealThiele> Graha trying to take the WoL fanboy title from Alisaie
[5:32:10] <thechromatictruth> cant wait for zenos trust
[5:32:18] <+SolGainer> @Ciglossonjr there are plenty, just look bettter
[5:32:22] <%Wulfphelz> I hope fandaniel kills Zenos in a punk bitch way as a sacrifice for zodiark
[5:32:23] <%HotSauceFiend> is this the end of the stream?

[5:32:32] <+doctor_brofessor> but yah Zenos doesn't need a redemption arc, he needs good boss music

[5:42:30] <MKII> those clips of old expansions is probably our life flashing before our eyes
