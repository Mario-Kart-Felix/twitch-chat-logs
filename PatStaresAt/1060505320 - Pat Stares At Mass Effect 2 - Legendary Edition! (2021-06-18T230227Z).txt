[0:06:14] <%Deano8817> The only trial I would ever go to
[0:06:18] <%bravebravesrobin> It's been a rough week bro (a very close friend of mine from college passed Sunday), and even though the funeral is tomorrow and I still haven't fully registered he's gone, these streams are part of what's keeping me sane.  Remember everyone, cherish your loved ones/friends when you have them.... Cheer500
[0:06:22] <%StaceMcGate> still surprised no Battarian crewmate for ME3. Would've been the perfect opportunity to introduce one.
[0:06:24] <$Ziegsy> CHAOS?! ziegsyChaos

[0:08:20] <%StaceMcGate> (doubt)
[0:08:20] <Brakkar95> dude Mass effect 2 is the KOTOR 2 of the franchise
[0:08:21] <Justlaxy> but javik doe
[0:08:21] <%StrawberryPantsu> YOU'RE SOUNDING LIKE ASHLEY
[0:08:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Batarians were written to be racially profiled
[0:08:23] <%StrawberryPantsu> SOTP
[0:08:23] <Broken_Sonex> They cut that because FUCK Batarians
[0:08:24] <%Puhff> batarians DansGame
[0:08:24] <%Deano8817> what if they had garrus tier voices?
[0:08:25] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[0:08:29] <Quilltaz> he shoulda been a Patarian instead
[0:08:30] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> As someone who has only played ME3 Multiplayer so far, why aren't all the characters in Mass Effect just Geth Juggernauts?
[0:08:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Which says more about the writers
[0:08:31] <fluffy_sauce> savage
[0:08:37] <%Cykron> Hahaha YES!
[0:08:39] <%Ynkubus_> Freak Batarian was an option at one point? We were robbed!
[0:08:40] <floredon> Garrus is for the birds!
[0:08:40] <peachy996> Wrong
[0:08:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you're married to a sicko @patstaresat
[0:08:43] <%walternatorz> oh, hi, paige.

[0:08:51] <peachy996> You'd be surprised what people want to bang
[0:08:51] <%Puhff> how come nobody wants to fuck the clor? :(
[0:08:52] <theanora1> you underestimate the weird stuff people want to fuck, Pat
[0:08:55] <+Pengers> Would’ve made 3 pretty awkward
[0:08:57] <%Puhff> elcor*
[0:08:57] <TourettesPlays> They probably didn't want ANOTHER genocide apologist on the squad
[0:08:58] <%Robot_Nixon_> How dare they not be conveniently sexy 😡
[0:08:59] <tranquilturnip> tfw no Hanar crewmate
[0:09:04] <%Cykron> The terrorist?

[0:09:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:09:15] <%dekkitout> You were justified
[0:09:16] <floredon> All Batarians must die
[0:09:16] <%JamesCorck> Batarians suck, aside from just all being jerks, they're just badly written. They're much lamer versions of Romulans, and the Romulans aren't even that good to begin with.
[0:09:16] <%UvBenServed> psaBig LUL
[0:09:18] <%valriot> LUL
[0:09:18] <Pookiedaexzile> invented to be hated

[0:09:32] <+RaveBV> Oh cool
[0:09:33] <+Pengers> Haha
[0:09:35] <stantheman_97> good batarian? you mean a dead batarian
[0:09:36] <Brakkar95> dude someone should do a restore content mode to ME2 like they did KOTOR2
[0:09:37] <Broken_Sonex> CREATED TO BE HATED
[0:09:38] <+D00msDayDan> shouldn't have pulled a gun on a spectre
[0:09:42] <peachy996> The only friendly Batarians are on Omega because of Aria
[0:09:42] <Brakkar95> *mod
[0:09:56] <%ape_hawk> DO IT
[0:09:57] <willyfreshness> Not All Battarians
[0:09:59] <%Cykron> Legion and Tali can totally become friends
[0:10:00] <%ape_hawk> JUGGLE FOR US
[0:10:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I did it easy
[0:10:02] <%baka_sugoi> PogChamp
[0:10:04] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt your lighting seems different today, are your windows open or something?
[0:10:04] <%valriot> Yeah you gotta save juggle and shit
[0:10:04] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> it's an ass worth juggling
[0:10:05] <%Deano8817> so basically only the chaddest shepards can pull it off
[0:10:06] <%DianaTheAscian> WOW
[0:10:07] <$SGrim> Teach her that Geth matter, with your penis
[0:10:10] <+D00msDayDan> just use a save editor to unlock legion
[0:10:14] <%dekkitout> Oh, I like these kinds of feats of gaming skills ™️
[0:10:15] <floredon> Tali is a disgusing alien
[0:10:21] <%Robot_Nixon_> But we can't romance legion so is it even worth it?
[0:10:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its not as difficult as it sounds
[0:10:28] <ianabstract> Save-editing Legion into your party immediately is amazing
[0:10:28] <tranquilturnip> LUL
[0:10:30] <ianabstract> I did that
[0:10:32] <viewtifulr> we got that krogan health bonus nice
[0:10:33] <%JamesCorck> Nah.
[0:10:33] <Drunkengen> Nope
[0:10:33] <Broken_Sonex> @floredon But she's got a big ass
[0:10:33] <ianabstract> It works fine
[0:10:34] <%SkyfireHero> not really
[0:10:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IT SURE DOES
[0:10:34] <CatRidder> probably
[0:10:35] <+jojo_abob> yeah
[0:10:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Any Tali Disrespect will not be tolerated in this chat
[0:10:36] <$realm_forge> Legion has to watch during the live scene at the end
[0:10:38] <%MugenSandan> Anyone else come off the BIG SATAN STREAM
[0:10:38] <+D00msDayDan> worked on my machine
[0:10:38] <ianabstract> Just don't bring him to that mission
[0:10:39] <tranquilturnip> Save editors are for glitches and mind goblins
[0:10:39] <%JamesCorck> You can re-edit the save
[0:10:42] <%StaceMcGate> unsure, but I watched a video of legion being in every mission but Mordin's
[0:10:46] <%ironohki> ironohki subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! I'm curious to get an honest Pat take on Biomutant. People seem to love it or hate it. I wonder if you think it's a "jank game for weirdos" like Witcher 1 was.
[0:10:49] <%Teintstein> what's up nerds
[0:10:49] <%bravebravesrobin> do it for the ass
[0:10:53] <+GingerStrawhat> I just got here from the Hell Stream
[0:10:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Tali is cheeked up and Geeked up
[0:10:55] <%ainzhelm> Legion LP funsies
[0:10:56] <%Cykron> Don't talk about my Purple Wife like that
[0:11:00] <ianabstract> He has lines for every single mission
[0:11:01] <CatRidder> dont cheat
[0:11:02] <Drunkengen> Legion even has dialouge for places that he doesnt normally belong there
[0:11:06] <%JamesCorck> Kudos to you for wanting to be fair and have a limit.
[0:11:09] <Drunkengen> and tali
[0:11:10] <$Solid_Stro> You get Legion along with the IFF, but then you have two missions left before the Normandy crew is kidnapped
[0:11:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can add Legion into your selectable squad without breaking anything using the save editor.
[0:11:14] <%SkyfireHero> HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR FIRST
[0:11:16] <%Teintstein> @PatStaresAt do you want some free gaming shit from the company I work for?
[0:11:20] <%StaceMcGate> lines for every mission, except Mordin and Horizon
[0:11:21] <%Ipsenscastle> Legion is best boy
[0:11:36] <peachy996> Shame Tali's massive hips aren't a floatation device
[0:11:41] <%walternatorz> I'm happy he actually wasn't the first.
[0:11:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh yeah this was a Two disc game
[0:11:46] <ianabstract> thanks Xbox
[0:11:48] <Quilltaz> Legion best Roboi

[0:12:06] <Brakkar95> im suprised no ones done a restore content mod to ME2
[0:12:09] <Broken_Sonex> I mean that's pretty understandable if that's the case
[0:12:15] <stantheman_97> oh god i forgot me2 had two discs
[0:12:31] <%dekkitout> Hidden huh...
[0:12:33] <%Cykron> @peachy996 No one said they're not
[0:12:33] <$realm_forge> There’s probably a mod to give Legion big ol tiddies
[0:12:36] <%ironohki> @GingerStrawhat I'll have to go back and watch it, but I love the satan list.

[0:28:59] <Pookiedaexzile> that "Reload" Sample is taken right from Pats colon
[0:29:08] <Broken_Sonex> My friend defined bitcoin as "the personal preference of a deranged uncle"

[0:29:23] <%dankjerri> right when pat sits on the toilet, his anus cocks like a shotgun
[0:29:24] <Broken_Sonex> shit*
[0:29:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> Pat currently fighting a losing battle with the toilet

[0:30:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> TOILET SLAIN
[0:30:17] <%maskedsongbird> Very carefully
[0:30:17] <%Dakuu75> Stop reading chat on the toilet! That's how you get the pink eye
[0:30:19] <$Ziegsy> @Profmcstevie porcelain CHAOS? ziegsyChaos
[0:30:22] <$realm_forge> We’ll be right back everyone Pat  is uh....”painting the porcelain” right now
[0:30:24] <%chance_h> u upperdecker it
[0:30:28] <zanzibarian_hamster> @StaceMcGate with a wooden spoon
[0:30:31] <+cowfootdude> Pat is pooping chaos
[0:30:31] <%dankjerri> "SHITS RECOVERED"
[0:30:31] <$Ziegsy> this is like a hot tub stream but much, MUCH worse
[0:30:34] <%logoth_> Shit faster
[0:30:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> People that know, know
[0:30:37] <~PatStaresAt> hey since I'm here
[0:30:42] <Profmcstevie> @Ziegsy how dare you use that powerful emote against me
[0:30:47] <%StaceMcGate> hope Pat remembered his poop knife
[0:30:49] <%JobbedBone> There was a period where people would pretend that we don't all use our phones on the toilet, I'm so glad we've all moved past it
[0:30:51] <+cowfootdude> How's the poop?
[0:30:53] <%Ipsenscastle> @Ziegsy cursed
[0:30:54] <Brakkar95> Yes sire?
[0:30:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes Shitting is embarrassing @PatStaresAt
[0:31:00] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Yes you are
[0:31:01] <%luftraumm1> pat, do not tweet from the toilet
[0:31:04] <~PatStaresAt> lemme ask y'all. on the podcast woolie said it was insane to leave an upper decker by crouching over the tank
[0:31:04] <%dekkitout> Chatting from the commode dude?
[0:31:05] <%Arancet> @PatStaresAt concentrate on your butt
[0:31:05] <jorniev> yes master?
[0:31:05] <Pookiedaexzile> We do laugh
[0:31:14] <%chance_h> @PatStaresAt how's the poo good sir?
[0:31:17] <%walternatorz> god damn it
[0:31:18] <~PatStaresAt> but the alternative is placing the pop in the tank manually
[0:31:19] <+cowfootdude> ...go on
[0:31:19] <+Chimeraelite> oh no
[0:31:20] <jorniev> oh god
[0:31:21] <%dekkitout> So he stands when he does it then
[0:31:24] <Profmcstevie> .....what the fuck does that mean
[0:31:29] <thelonechris> It's insane to leave an upper decker normally
[0:31:30] <$realm_forge> PUSH PAT  WE CAN SEE THE HEAD
[0:31:31] <%Arancet> neither are good
[0:31:32] <%logoth_> thet pop?
[0:31:34] <Brakkar95> ya no hover poop
[0:31:37] <+Chimeraelite> True. Direct from the source or not at all
[0:31:40] <peachy996> Like Soda Pop?
[0:31:41] <Brakkar95> no touchy poop
[0:31:41] <%StaceMcGate> hovering above the seat is for cowards
[0:31:42] <%Arkfyre> Between those 2 options, I would crouch over the tank
[0:31:43] <%Ipsenscastle> @PatStaresAt is this something you've had much call to do in life
[0:31:44] <%justnathan18> I like the interacting with the stream while deucing.
[0:31:52] <%luftraumm1> squatting is absolutely more civilized
[0:31:52] <%Ranryu692> that's just because leaving an upper decker, while funny, is insane
[0:31:54] <%dekkitout> I remain in the assumption woolie stands up when he upper deckers
[0:31:56] <jorniev> crowning?
[0:31:58] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat yeaI, you shit on the floor which has toilet paper down, then you put it in the tank like youre throwing out a Gief Surprise
[0:31:59] <zanzibarian_hamster> I think it depends on how good you are at pooping, if you put your weight on it you're in danger of removing the toilet
[0:32:03] <Pookiedaexzile> The move isn't the upper Deck, Shit on the toilet paper dispenser or near the toilet but not in it
[0:32:05] <%chance_h> @PatStaresAt wait do you not know about the 3 shells?
[0:32:11] <%StaceMcGate> @justnathan18 the next big trend on Twitch after hot tub fad goes away
[0:32:13] <%maskedsongbird> @PatStaresAt You can crouch for an upper decker if you get one of those bench seat things that they use for bath time for the elderly. Then you can't fall off!
[0:32:14] <balthazar758> oh god
[0:32:15] <%JobbedBone> thats what the shells are for LUL duh
[0:32:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Some place like a corner, where its hard to clean
[0:32:21] <Brakkar95> woolie is just sick and likes to play with his poop
[0:32:22] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Is.. is Pat doing an upper decker to his own toilet right now?
[0:32:28] <%justnathan18> How is Pat typing in the chat if hes also holding the TP?
[0:32:31] <Profmcstevie> I'm waiting on the 4 shell system to appear in a cyberpunk game eventually
[0:32:33] <+LionKagura> @JobbedBone now it all makes sense LUL
[0:32:34] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt you could poop on the ground, onto a towel and drop into the back
[0:32:35] <$Ziegsy> what is an upper decker?
[0:32:36] <%dankjerri> or just shit into your open hand, coward
[0:32:40] <%ironohki> @chance_h Haha... he doesn't know the three shells. Because... ahem... of course he wouldn't.
[0:32:40] <%dekkitout> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx He's also in da nude
[0:32:42] <$realm_forge> Someone get pat an old priest and a young priest so that this demon may be exorcized
[0:32:43] <zanzibarian_hamster> Upperdecking your own toilet is a power move
[0:32:43] <%Cykron> Man he must be baking bread in there
[0:32:48] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt if you're intent on leaving an upper decker, you can rig something up to assist you so you don't hurt yourself.
[0:32:49] <+cowfootdude> We tend to think of the most philosophical questions on the toilet.
[0:32:54] <balthazar758> poop strats
[0:32:55] <+SinnerEbru> @dankjerri yeah i was boutta say!!
[0:32:55] <+LionKagura> @Ziegsy shitting in the commode at the top
[0:32:56] <%luftraumm1> holding the tp with one hand and typing with the other
[0:32:57] <%Ipsenscastle> Toilets are one of earth's most precious resources
[0:32:59] <%ironohki> @dankjerri Use your wizard magic to remove it.
[0:33:00] <jorniev> is pat on the upper deck on his house?
[0:33:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Upperdecking too tame for the modern prank auience
[0:33:05] <HaroldDonchee> manually is just shitting into your tp hand and placing it in the toilet
[0:33:09] <+cowfootdude> Like, "Should I upper deck directly into the tank or manually?"
[0:33:23] <Brakkar95> Pat do a pole lmao
[0:33:27] <%Ipsenscastle> Why not just shit on the person directly
[0:33:29] <%maskedsongbird> LUL LUL LUL
[0:33:33] <Alzero83> Damnit Pat, you wouldnt take so long in the bathroom if you just pooped without removing all your clothes....
[0:33:36] <%dankjerri> @ironohki yeah thats just a bit of mage hand, but I assume a pat shit weights more than ten pounds so it wouldn't work
[0:33:39] <Brakkar95> then well know the truth
[0:33:39] <%ainzhelm> Guys what if he never comes back?
[0:33:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> The upper deck is the top part of the toilet where the flushing water is stored, "upperdecking" is pooping into said top part
[0:33:45] <%dekkitout> @Ipsenscastle Well now thats just a sex act
[0:33:46] <%Cykron> @Ziegsy Shitting on the tank cover with your feet on the toilet seat
[0:33:47] <%NateyBeak> he's busy flushing his cereal
[0:33:51] <Pookiedaexzile> The one thing Pat is right about is shitting naked
[0:33:54] <Pookiedaexzile> It's freeing
[0:33:58] <$Ziegsy> Oh god. ziegsyNana just buy some cheap tongs, you primitives
[0:33:59] <+LionKagura> Just shit in your pants and put on a new pair :)
[0:34:01] <$realm_forge> JUST GRAB ON TO SOMETHING AND GIVE IT HELL PAT WE BELIEVE IN YOU
[0:34:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Natural
[0:34:09] <Alzero83> Pooping Naked? Are you a heathen>?
[0:34:10] <%Dakuu75> He probably has Gief and/or Elmo clawing at the door the whole time. It's ruining his concentration
[0:34:10] <%luftraumm1> shitting naked in the dark
[0:34:13] <Alzero83> yovgStare
[0:34:15] <%justnathan18> I knew a guy that would shower after every time he shit
[0:34:17] <%maskedsongbird> @Pookiedaexzile Don't encourage him.
[0:34:20] <%dankjerri> shit naked, legs spread wide, and then bend at the waist to touch the floor
[0:34:21] <balthazar758> @pookiedaexzile return to monke
[0:34:23] <%Cykron> I keep a bucket of sand next to the window
[0:34:35] <zanzibarian_hamster> Real men shit in the shower and waffle stomp, like andre the giant
[0:34:42] <%dekkitout> Pooping nude/in the dark is pretty comforting
[0:34:45] <%Nobrev> where do you guys keep your poop knives? mine's in the plunger holder
[0:34:46] <PanicSwytch> Brb...what did i miss
[0:34:46] <%luftraumm1> @dankjerri doing the spiderman
[0:34:46] <Brakkar95> my brother in law has to shower after every poop xD
[0:34:54] <%dankjerri> pat must be washing his hands
[0:34:54] <%maskedsongbird> People describing doing a fucking acrobatics routine just to shit in the tank. LUL
[0:35:01] <%dankjerri> he git quiet
[0:35:03] <%NateyBeak> you know your in love when you can do an upperdecker double blumpkin with someone
[0:35:03] <Alzero83> Only people who use Inverted controls and Poop naked are psychopaths
[0:35:06] <%Dakuu75> HE LIVES
[0:35:07] <%Cykron> BIg poop time
[0:35:07] <%chance_h> @Cykron do u flush the sand or just garbage can it?
[0:35:08] <Pookiedaexzile> A shower after a poop is the only way to start the day
[0:35:12] <Pookiedaexzile> None
[0:35:13] <%maskedsongbird> Lol. You good, bro?
[0:35:14] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat exhausted

[0:40:30] <+SocialMisfitGamer> FAKE OUT
[0:40:42] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I dont think any squad mates have any dialogue for Overlord
[0:40:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Smart
[0:40:48] <$Futurecity10> Arrivial shows up after Horizon
[0:40:48] <%justnathan18> @GalacticaPhanto Thank you, its much appreciated. This is the first time ive been able to chill all day
[0:40:49] <%Garthunox> just postgame overlord
[0:40:50] <%Ipsenscastle> Arrival appears WAY TOO EARLY
[0:40:51] <%ape_hawk> pat, you thinking about doing the dragon age series before 4 comes out?
[0:40:52] <peachy996> That works too
[0:40:52] <jorniev> arrival is better as post game
[0:40:54] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> i could be wrong tho
[0:40:56] <chicken_apostle> Boomer liquid!!!!!
[0:41:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That's what I do
[0:41:02] <+NopeBadguy> @ItsYaGirlMaria someone reacts to legion but that's it
[0:41:03] <Broken_Sonex> Do Arrival dead last no matter what you do
[0:41:04] <GustauveVIII> squad mates have literally no dialogue in dlc
[0:41:06] <%JobbedBone> the white one tastes like shampoo D:
[0:41:08] <%Garthunox> Pat seriously wait until post game for arrival
[0:41:09] <$RealThiele> overlord is pretty nuts
[0:41:09] <%dankjerri> sipsipHonk sipsipHonk
[0:41:10] <Pookiedaexzile> I played this on lanuch and never got to the DLC besides Zaheed
[0:41:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> I did Overlord earlier today and it was worse than I remembered. Also squad-mates get no dialogue so bring whoever the fuck it don't matter.
[0:41:20] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Arrival last always
[0:41:21] <%MidnightBurst12> not at all
[0:41:22] <Pookiedaexzile> I have no idea what Kasumi is about but I'm down
[0:41:22] <%afronooch> lol yeah
[0:41:23] <%machshop> no it isn't lol
[0:41:24] <%Dakuu75> question: Did pat start a new game because of that power-up kerfuckle?
[0:41:24] <televisedrevolting> Arrival is better for post-game.
[0:41:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> Firewalker came first.
[0:41:28] <%tauruslul> psaDown
[0:41:31] <%jillpilled> Arrival has always been post really so that's dead wrong
[0:41:35] <+NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt it's zaeed, firewalker, kasumi, overlord, lair, arrival
[0:41:50] <%Ipsenscastle> @Too_Much_Nukie yeah I remembered Overlord being pretty cool, but it straight up sucked
[0:41:52] <%chance_h> gotta get best girl and Legion asap
[0:41:53] <%justnathan18> Arrival is the last thing before 3. Its why Shep gets arrested
[0:41:55] <+StrikeTheErf> I did lair and arrival post final mission, felt great
[0:41:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Zaheed is first, because thats the only shit I remember
[0:41:58] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Lair and Arrival make sense for postgame tbh
[0:42:03] <+Brightstreak> I love your stuff, do you plan to stream strive in the future? you're my potemkin mentor!
[0:42:04] <Broken_Sonex> Arrival is the one you need after the Collector Base
[0:42:05] <%afronooch> besides arrival, they all fit in whenever
[0:42:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> I remembered Overlord being bad and it's worse.
[0:42:11] <%shurtal> arrival works best post game, imo
[0:42:16] <%ainzhelm> @patstaresat You want to wait on Zaeeds so that you don’t risk not having enough paragon or renegade to talk him down
[0:42:17] <chicken_apostle> Such a sadness that EA publishes these games :(
[0:42:17] <peachy996> You gonna do the Planet Anomalies?
[0:42:24] <+StrikeTheErf> jank Mako
[0:42:25] <kobaltXIV> Was the Normandy crash DLC for free?
[0:42:26] <%Mattais88> Vehicle missions
[0:42:26] <%Garthunox> Arrival is a direct link to ME3
[0:42:26] <%Dfreddy8> Hammerhead
[0:42:28] <$Futurecity10> The not mako
[0:42:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> Arrival makes more sense after the collector base but it also gives upgrades and is easy so whenever.
[0:42:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its bad
[0:42:31] <%Ipsenscastle> Firewalker is outright skippable
[0:42:33] <peachy996> the hovertank
[0:42:37] <%maskedsongbird> I remember Overlord being decent, except for the shitty vehicle sections.
[0:42:38] <%ironohki> Arrival makes sense post game. I think Lair could be done anytime, honestly, but after is fine.
[0:42:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pointless Vehicles Missions
[0:42:46] <%shadowsofpain> Hammerhead missions
[0:42:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> Shadow Broker gives rewards for visiting it between missions or once a day. So if you want those do it earlier.
[0:42:52] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Should always do Kasumi's loyalty mission first. I will never stop advocating for getting the best SMG early.
[0:42:55] <%Shubreaker> firewalker is pre req for overlord
[0:42:56] <$realm_forge> Fire walker is mako missions but waaaay better
[0:42:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> Firewalker after boning
[0:43:00] <%dankjerri> do the big one
[0:43:00] <Broken_Sonex> Arrival is the one that works best after the Collector Base
[0:43:01] <$RealThiele> honk honk, step-quarian
[0:43:12] <%Dfreddy8> I straight skipped Firewalker going into 3
[0:43:18] <tattleworm> firewalker you can just fit in whenever, there's no big storyline or anything
[0:43:21] <%toastybites> Arrival should definitely be post game
[0:43:22] <%justnathan18> Shadow Broker has a payoff if you have all your companions!
[0:43:25] <+D00msDayDan> oh yeah shadow broker postgame gives you free shit
[0:43:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Lair of the Shadow Broke is good after getting the first wave of crewmates @patstaresat
[0:43:47] <%Dakuu75> "Dew-seh-mon"
[0:43:50] <%machshop> s l o w l y
[0:43:54] <peachy996> You could skip Firewalker but you can do it like 10 minutes too
[0:43:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Slowly
[0:43:56] <%heartlesshealer> dew-seh-mon
[0:43:59] <thunka10> That the new digimon?
[0:44:00] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Canonically, Arrival should be played AFTER completing the main quest

[0:46:41] <Broken_Sonex> I mean.....yeah...but....
[0:46:42] <%justnathan18> @PatStaresAt Do you have an upgrade location guide pulled up?
[0:46:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> But that's fair.
[0:46:44] <%maskedsongbird> @dankjerri Probably.
[0:46:44] <%stickislaw> I also care! Probing a particular planet in the Sol system is always the first thing I do in the game!
[0:46:49] <peachy996> so it can all come crumbling down when me3 starts?
[0:46:50] <%ape_hawk> ME3 has a pretty poor opening sequence
[0:46:54] <%heartlesshealer> YOU CAN SURE TRY
[0:46:55] <%dankjerri> play new vegas and just say its ME3

[0:47:01] <%JamesCorck> It's the best Mass Effect DLC.
[0:47:04] <%Arkfyre> Citadel is so much fun
[0:47:05] <Alzero83> Its about the Journey @PatStaresAt not the Destination
[0:47:06] <jorniev> Vanguard me3 is kinda fun
[0:47:06] <Virokwet> good
[0:47:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:47:08] <$Futurecity10> Damn did you get spoiled on it?
[0:47:11] <+D00msDayDan> you should be
[0:47:11] <%heartlesshealer> it's good
[0:47:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Playing Femshep Jack has better chemistry with her
[0:47:15] <%JamesCorck> It's a genuinely great DLC.
[0:47:15] <%maskedsongbird> Just pure fanservice from start to finish.
[0:47:18] <tattleworm> it's fanservice as fuck but we deserve it after that ending
[0:47:18] <+Buzzkill983> ME3 Citadel is all the memes concentrated in a dlc
[0:47:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> ME3 has a lot of good stuff that people ignore because of its reputation.
[0:47:19] <jorniev> true
[0:47:20] <%Ipsenscastle> ME3 has some really good stuff, I genuinely think you'll enjoy a lot of it
[0:47:23] <%ironohki> OHNO
[0:47:25] <SaltyAzteca> OOOF
[0:47:27] <%maskedsongbird> LUL LUL LUL
[0:47:27] <%JamesCorck> The ending of ME3 feels like it was written by Alex Kurtzman.
[0:47:28] <peachy996> Yeah but that Destination really suuuuuuuucks
[0:47:29] <jorniev> TRUE THAT
[0:47:30] <KaitlynnHere> Oh they’re releasing a dlc??

[0:47:35] <fairore> wow bro
[0:47:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> It happens to all Adventurers honey
[0:47:37] <%JamesCorck> There's not fooling ourselves anymore.
[0:47:38] <Jolly_Adventurer> damn
[0:47:38] <%JobbedBone> "experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted"
[0:47:40] <KaitlynnHere> Fuck that line

[0:47:44] <%Cykron> next bit
[0:47:44] <%Bailey__gaming> Cummies
[0:47:44] <%justnathan18> @Pookiedaexzile Jack was supposed to be a femshep love interest, but Fox News made them rethink it
[0:47:45] <jorniev> THATS REALLY GOOD PAT
[0:47:47] <%ape_hawk> "no, baby, its okay, youre bigger than all the other guys ive been with..."
[0:47:48] <%mikesapartment> I thought the implication was nutting early?
[0:47:48] <%Dakuu75> so glad my co-worker was next to me when you said that
[0:47:50] <crookedfinger68> "Gotta nut during any trip" gotcha
[0:47:50] <$Ziegsy> ziegsyNana pat no
[0:47:51] <%dekkitout> Any good journey always has a nice stroll downtown
[0:47:52] <%heartlesshealer> I enjoy when it's short. Less discomfort and more time for kissing
[0:47:53] <one_punman> just make sure you don't trip when you nut
[0:47:55] <KaitlynnHere> That’s just an excuse to be lazy

[0:48:28] <%afronooch> @zerointelligence000 very
[0:48:30] <Pookiedaexzile> @justnathan18 That doesn't stop what has been done to me
[0:48:30] <%toastybites> @zerointelligence000 GOT Season 8
[0:48:34] <peachy996> Purgatory is a prison ship and a crappy bar on the Citadel in ME3
[0:48:37] <Brakkar95> Well this is where i leave you guys, time to watch previous ME streams to get caught up! Hope everyone has a great night!!!
[0:48:53] <%Dfreddy8> How much moneys
[0:48:55] <tattleworm> legion on tali's loyalty is incredible though
[0:49:00] <+kingofchaos56> ahh good old space pat love to see it
[0:49:00] <KaitlynnHere> No don’t contaminate tali
[0:49:03] <%JobbedBone> shoutout to all the other losers from the Random Insanity board o7
[0:49:05] <%dekkitout> He's right ya know
[0:49:05] <$Futurecity10> Fucking what
[0:49:07] <%Shubreaker> psaGoblin
[0:49:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You will want to have all the upgrades for ME3. They carry over in a weird way.
[0:49:19] <KaitlynnHere> She’s a delicate flower!
[0:49:22] <%jillpilled> Yep
[0:49:25] <%maskedsongbird> @zerointelligence000 I personally don't mind it as much, but, let's just say that it's like watching BSG. Awesome for every possible second except for the last hour, and even then it kind of depends on your tastes.
[0:49:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Legion and Tali should be required to have to play together on their loyalites
[0:49:35] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt you might need to do the first firewalker, cos the first one spawns 4 or 5 other missions
[0:49:37] <$Futurecity10> you should do that
[0:49:39] <+Buzzkill983> Oops
[0:49:40] <%dekkitout> @KaitlynnHere Nah, cultivate the petri dish
[0:49:40] <$RealThiele> just have Tali be in some sort of decontamination glory hole room
[0:49:41] <peachy996> Anomaly Mission that N7 one
[0:49:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's the norm I feel.
[0:49:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats the only way to beat the game Pat
[0:49:44] <+NopeBadguy> OH
[0:49:46] <+NopeBadguy> LMAO
[0:49:46] <%MoguManda> that's what I did
[0:49:48] <KaitlynnHere> Don’t put your dick on the flower bro
[0:49:49] <+NopeBadguy> RIP THE CREW
[0:49:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> isn't that how it works?
[0:49:58] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean if you don't Spoilers happen
[0:49:59] <jorniev> people got melted then?
[0:50:07] <James_Quivers> KELLY SMOOTHIE
[0:50:07] <%JamesCorck> Fuck yeah!
[0:50:07] <%Ipsenscastle> no
[0:50:07] <TourettesPlays> Yea that hidden time limit is pretty cringe tbh
[0:50:07] <%ape_hawk> sure
[0:50:10] <%afronooch> sure
[0:50:13] <$Futurecity10> No. Get the crew first
[0:50:13] <%Dfreddy8> Naw
[0:50:13] <%JamesCorck> Do it man, do it.
[0:50:15] <%Cykron> Yeah sure
[0:50:15] <%toastybites> Yes
[0:50:15] <jorniev> CREW GOT MELTED?
[0:50:16] <%NateyBeak> do whatever i just like watching
[0:50:16] <tattleworm> firewalker's a quick 5 minute thing
[0:50:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can do infinite side missions before Horizon, and before the IFF.
[0:50:20] <crookedfinger68> yeah i think thats smart
[0:50:22] <+NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Not raelly. A lot of the N7 assignments are just fluff.
[0:50:22] <%dekkitout> Side missions are my shit
[0:50:23] <Profmcstevie> Hit me, I love content
[0:50:25] <bellmorgu> sure
[0:50:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's only between the IFF and the base that you're timed.
[0:50:27] <KaitlynnHere> No
[0:50:27] <%maskedsongbird> What was Project Firewalker? I don't remember that one?
[0:50:31] <peachy996> Won't take long
[0:50:31] <SaltyAzteca> yaaaay....
[0:50:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> @maskedsongbird Hammerhead. It sucks.
[0:50:41] <%Cykron> Get Jack and get her over with
[0:50:44] <%NateyBeak> time for bald to save bald
[0:50:47] <TourettesPlays> Pat Firewalker can be skipped you'll still be  level cap by end of the game and its just worthless as far as gameplay goes
[0:50:49] <%ape_hawk> enhancement for your peen?
[0:50:51] <%Dfreddy8> won't you be forced to go to horizon after Jack?
[0:50:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Balls will be exposed in this chat
[0:50:53] <%maskedsongbird> @Too_Much_Nukie Ah. Got it.
[0:50:55] <+NopeBadguy> GOBLINS SLAIN
[0:50:56] <+zuzuxiv> oh
[0:50:56] <%MidnightBurst12> no way D:
[0:50:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> side missions give lots of good upgrades
[0:50:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack is a normal person
[0:51:02] <GustauveVIII> *all krogan squadmembers" lol
[0:51:05] <thetunnelhomer> Krogan Shotgun is pretty cool
[0:51:07] <$RealThiele> offscreen goblin victory
[0:51:09] <Broken_Sonex> GOTTA HAVE IT
[0:51:12] <%Ipsenscastle> I second skipping Firewalker, it's a complete waste of time
[0:51:14] <KaitlynnHere> @nateybeak it’s good luck if they rub their bald heads together
[0:51:14] <%justnathan18> How long did you have to go back to get that?
[0:51:16] <%ainzhelm> @maskedsongbird Hover tank
[0:51:19] <%Ipsenscastle> content free
[0:51:20] <knight_verse> Aah yes, the cheath-through is back.
[0:51:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pat might actually not be at cap if he's saving firewalker and arrival for the end. It's close now because you don't get the 10% exp boost anymore.
[0:51:27] <+zuzuxiv> no, you only feed the goblin
[0:51:37] <jackelzxaa> Theres actually more upgrades for some things in the game than what the number says
[0:51:40] <jackelzxaa> You need one more
[0:51:41] <%Dakuu75> ...
[0:51:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah if you buy an upgrade you don't have to research it.
[0:51:45] <%DJFakie> Nah, you get it
[0:51:45] <%kujofire990> nah it counts
[0:51:46] <ioci2112> it gives you the upgrade straight up
[0:51:46] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Bought upgrades don't ahve to be researched
[0:51:48] <jackelzxaa> Its a weird tier system
[0:51:48] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Store give
[0:51:49] <Pookiedaexzile> .....
[0:51:49] <%Mattais88> yeah store is auto, found is reasearch
[0:51:53] <%Ranryu692> you need one more
[0:51:54] <KaitlynnHere> Bald on bald action
[0:51:56] <Pookiedaexzile> What does Research do pat
[0:51:58] <peachy996> Actually yeah do the sidequests first then Jack. After you get her you're going to Horizon.
[0:51:58] <+cowfootdude> Finding it on missions you have to research it. Vendors give it automatically.
[0:51:58] <knight_verse> How long has he been on?
[0:52:00] <jackelzxaa> store isnt research
[0:52:06] <%DJFakie> If you miss an upgrade pickup a vendor should sell it somewhere later
[0:52:08] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> No
[0:52:09] <Symmy_> arent store upgrades and crafting upgrades different as in you need both to max out damage?
[0:52:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no that's the third one to get
[0:52:11] <%DorianCreed> 2 researched
[0:52:13] <jackelzxaa> It took me a while to figure this systems details out
[0:52:15] <$RealThiele> lets compromise and say 60%
[0:52:17] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Yes, and if you get extra from DLC, it bumps to X/6
[0:52:21] <s1rcuit> @knight_verse 52 minutes
[0:52:22] <jackelzxaa> Theres more than 5 in the game on some pat
[0:52:26] <+LionKagura> @knight_verse almost an hour
[0:52:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's more than 6.
[0:52:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[0:52:37] <jackelzxaa> The dlc goes beyond the number on some of these
[0:52:41] <%Ranryu692> the DLC added a sixth one for each I believe
[0:52:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Some of the weapons go up to /7. Heavy Weapons go up to /9.
[0:52:54] <peachy996> Jack now lives
[0:52:55] <LordOfThePoultry> very important
[0:52:55] <knight_verse> @s1cuit: Oh, do he just started playing then? Thanks.
[0:52:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Yup
[0:52:56] <%NopeBadguy> GARRUS COOMING IN THE BATTERIES AT HIS NEW GUNS
[0:52:57] <%Dakuu75> Yeah, upgrade your ship, like a ratchet and clank game.
[0:52:59] <thetunnelhomer> Thanix canon is so cool
[0:53:03] <peachy996> Garrus/Thane now lives
[0:53:04] <jackelzxaa> Zaeeds dlc gives you the sixth upgrade for your “of five” weapon damage
[0:53:04] <+Buzzkill983> Tali research for ship shields
[0:53:04] <zerointelligence000> third is tali
[0:53:09] <Alzero83> Shields
[0:53:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt How could you forget about upgrading the Normandy with CBT?
[0:53:13] <%justnathan18> If you dont get one, Jack gets fucking blasted
[0:53:15] <%StaceMcGate> Pat...
[0:53:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Tali unlocks CBT
[0:53:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Also how many people forgot about THane

[0:54:35] <$RealThiele> F pats bowels
[0:54:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> @justnathan18 Jack is the first to die from ship damage specifically.
[0:54:37] <%dekkitout> It encourages polyamorism psaCrazyhand
[0:54:40] <%NopeBadguy> EKG has flatlined
[0:54:42] <%NopeBadguy> He is dead
[0:54:42] <derap41> @PatStaresAt get a butt plug to stop the leakage
[0:54:42] <%KetsuoTaberu> DONT DIE PAT
[0:54:42] <Estuko> FeelsGoodMan my dog came home from a week long stay after back surgery, seeing pat play with his dog and now I get mine back. This week is alright
[0:54:43] <@PeachSaliva> No, I'm in here occasionally
[0:54:43] <peachy996> It's the armor one that kills Jack I think
[0:54:43] <%ironohki> F
[0:54:48] <%DJFakie> THEY DON'T EXPECT YOU TO SURVIVE
[0:54:50] <jackelzxaa> Pats poop chatting
[0:54:50] <%justnathan18> @PatStaresAt Are you doing this just to avoid getting Jack?
[0:54:50] <Estuko> FeelsBirthdayMan
[0:54:53] <@PeachSaliva> I hear him running and im like lol
[0:54:53] <ioci2112> death by poop
[0:54:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> @justnathan18 There's a flowchart you can look at to see who can die when.
[0:54:55] <Sotetsu> Please tell us your butt is okay.
[0:54:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> why did you poison him Paige??
[0:55:00] <%DJFakie> PROVE THEM WRONG, PATRICK

[0:55:18] <jackelzxaa> @patstaresat do you know about the romance glitch that lets you just trigger all of them postgame?
[0:55:19] <tranquilturnip> I was tabbed
[0:55:19] <%justnathan18> @Too_Much_Nukie Thats worth looking into. Thank you!
[0:55:22] <peachy996> Mordin is easy to get killed too
[0:55:22] <%DianaTheAscian> I'd pay money to see Pat run
[0:55:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> It makes sense that Jack is the first to die from ship damage since she lives under engineering.
[0:55:23] <$RealThiele> ultimate shitposting technique
[0:55:23] <knight_verse> @peachsaliva when he runs, does he waddle?
[0:55:26] <tranquilturnip> rip pat's butt
[0:55:26] <%NateyBeak> @PeachSaliva he's gonna clog that toilet with all that cereal he's dumping rn
[0:55:27] <KaitlynnHere> Oh. No
[0:55:28] <%dekkitout> To resist poison like the kings of old

[0:55:39] <Zeif00> @PeachSaliva What'd you cook him?
[0:55:40] <%RetroCop87> Pat's in the bathroom to kill CHAOS

[0:55:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Paige why are you that old lady that feeds people arsenic if they're rude to you
[0:55:44] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt What Normandy upgrade do you need to get a new butt so you don't die to the Collectors?
[0:55:44] <Pookiedaexzile> @PeachSaliva Peg him softer
[0:55:46] <KaitlynnHere> New butthole is being created live on stream
[0:55:48] <%dekkitout> Oh, maybe that one french nurse can fix his bum

[0:55:51] <@PeachSaliva> @Zeif00 steak and potatoes
[0:55:52] <peachy996> Keeping Mordin alive is a task unless you have him play escort
[0:55:54] <Profmcstevie> Butt restoration project is a go
[0:55:55] <%DianaTheAscian> @PeachSaliva LUL LUL LUL
[0:55:58] <%ironohki> @RetroCop87 I feel like this is a good strategy to kill chaos.
[0:56:05] <@PeachSaliva> I used ghee to cook the steak in though, so maybe that's it. But I didn't use a lot.
[0:56:06] <Zeif00> @PeachSaliva Fuckin yum
[0:56:08] <%rekinom> The first Normandy upgrade better be the air fresheners in the bathrooms
[0:56:08] <derap41> is the Red Rose in bloom?
[0:56:09] <tranquilturnip> we can rebuild him, we have the technology
[0:56:10] <Profmcstevie> buttless pat is now faster

[0:56:30] <%ironohki> Spinach is great.
[0:56:32] <derap41> @PeachSaliva Ghee doesn't have any lactose is should be fine
[0:56:32] <%Arancet> *A* spinach leaf doesnt count pat
[0:56:33] <peachy996> Mordin can live but you need a lot of Heavy Hitters with him staying behind or just take him along
[0:56:33] <Pookiedaexzile> What if Pat took and shit and got taller
[0:56:36] <%RetroCop87> Pat's toilet undergoing 4th impact
[0:56:37] <$lumporr> i like to imagine when someone's butt falls off it's like a semicircular chunk has been cut out of their whole region
[0:56:38] <@PeachSaliva> If there's a fart meta, can there be a shout down the stairs from the shitter meta?
[0:56:39] <knight_verse> @patstaresat don't fall into the toilet
[0:56:39] <%ironohki> @mike2hands poop

[0:56:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @mike2hands nothing lol Pat has been dying from Paige poisoning him
[0:56:57] <$RealThiele> butter literally greaseing the way to make shit fly out at high velocity
[0:57:01] <%DianaTheAscian> It kinda weird knowing Pats in chat rn and is currently shitting himself
[0:57:03] <%justnathan18> Word has it, you can make more money on twitch if you fart right into the mic
[0:57:05] <%dekkitout> Shoutting from the Shitter meta is a steep climb
[0:57:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOW THIS IS TWITCH STREAMING
[0:57:13] <%rekinom> Pat's taking a shower after each of these poops right?
[0:57:16] <%rekinom> Right?
[0:57:19] <Drunkengen> IS HE DEAD?
[0:57:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> I stopped playing Mass Effect 3 for this smh
[0:57:25] <$lumporr> Some streamers poop into the mic, to drive up engagement
[0:57:26] <KaitlynnHere> Now I have to poop
[0:57:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> @justnathan18 ASsMR
[0:57:30] <%DianaTheAscian> hes pooping
[0:57:33] <slix3431> He finally shit to death
[0:57:36] <derap41> @rekinom Can't believe he has degenerate so mucgh
[0:57:38] <%Puhff> @rekinom of course
[0:57:42] <Sotetsu> @peachsaliva How do you cook your spinach?
[0:57:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @too_much_nukie this is high quality content sir
[0:57:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> Don't make Pat laugh, it will make the poop climb back in like a scared turtle
[0:57:50] <%maskedsongbird> @lumporr LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:57:51] <$lumporr> wait if pat's shitting that means he's completely naked right now
[0:57:51] <jackelzxaa> I wish theyd made it so more decisions along the way can lock you out of death avoidance in the suicide mission
[0:57:53] <$lumporr> he's vulnerable
[0:57:54] <%JobbedBone> I accidentally ordered a giant nacho thing the size of a pizza BibleThump
[0:57:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Bro, Can Vaum (disco elysuim) get Mass Effect
[0:57:56] <derap41> he Done shitted himself gone
[0:57:56] <%Dfreddy8> Pat should just keep a shit bucket under him.
[0:57:58] <%dekkitout> RiP Pats fragile butt
[0:57:59] <$realm_forge> Pat dropped like 20 lbs during this stream
[0:58:13] <$RealThiele> what if while hes shitting a hobo came at him with a needle full of random stuff
[0:58:13] <%justnathan18> My dutch friend insists on making mac n cheese with spinach in it. Everytime.
[0:58:15] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat's just trying to cash in after that one time Dodger farted and chat donated a bunch of money to make her feel better
[0:58:20] <%DianaTheAscian> Pats pretending to be a smash player rn
[0:58:20] <joeski87> joeski87 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:58:35] <%ironohki> @realm_forge Did he emerge with a shock of white hair? Did he look a new man, fit and lean?!
[0:58:40] <jackelzxaa> Certain loyalties, upgrades, and recruitments should have come with inherent cost.  Having the everyone lives outcome be difficult to figure out and require mixing paragon and renegade along the way woulda been cool
[0:58:42] <zerointelligence000> Didn't know Pat played Melty Blood
[0:58:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat can't pretend to be a smash player, That's still a crime
[0:58:48] <Pookiedaexzile> even if its just attempted
[0:58:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> You ever weigh yourself before and after a poop? How come you don't lose weight? I have DESTROYED toilets before and didn't lose a pound from it
[0:58:59] <%YakumoYomi> Twitch needs a category called "Toilets, Outhouses, and Water Closets"
[0:59:00] <%ironohki> @zerointelligence000 Jesus christ how horrifying
[0:59:00] <knight_verse> Don't wipe with your socks Pat.
[0:59:02] <$realm_forge> LUL
[0:59:02] <derap41> @Ipsenscastle Now that's just rude
[0:59:08] <%Ipsenscastle> @ironohki LUL I'd forgotten that comic
[0:59:10] <$lumporr> i can imagine the shot of the bathroom from above with pat waddling around naked leaking poop and it just zooms in on his phone on the ground with chat scrolling
[0:59:12] <ianabstract> due to a glitch in the matrix, instead of giving gief the runs, eating those blueberries has unleashed hell on pats intestines instead
[0:59:24] <+CookieCutter007> the stink lines are coming through the monitor
[0:59:25] <%dekkitout> @zanzibarian_hamster Sounds like weak poops, amirite folks tajC
[0:59:31] <%jillpilled> Stream bathroom set up when nugggsHmm
[0:59:32] <jackelzxaa> Getting no deaths should have come at the expense of other things that you’d care about storywise like tali’s bad loyalty outcome
[0:59:33] <Pookiedaexzile> @zanzibarian_hamster You're not doing it right, you're actually behind on the meal you ate and are shitting out food from before that
[0:59:33] <%JobbedBone> Its so cool that Dodger still streams as a mom,
[0:59:41] <$realm_forge> Hopefully Paige and the babies made it outside the 200 yard blast radius
[0:59:42] <derap41> ASMR poop emergencies when?
[0:59:47] <%vivaldiva> wait i disappeared for 20 minutes is he still poopin'?
[0:59:49] <$RealThiele> the longer you take in to shit the more water your colon and large intestine retain so you dont lose as much weight as a big juicy turd
[0:59:50] <%ape_hawk> paige, did you poison pat again?
[1:00:02] <%Arancet> @vivaldiva poop round 2, actually\

[1:00:49] <$RealThiele> ghee is straight butter though it will turn your insides intoa  slip n slide
[1:00:50] <derap41> Do you think he sprayed the floor as he ran?

[1:01:11] <zerointelligence000> Did Pat pull a Woolie and disappear due to his own bowels?
[1:01:13] <%StaceMcGate> Has everyone been enjoying high-quality content of Pat pooping for 22 minutes?
[1:01:13] <%justnathan18> @joeski87 Thats the spirit. Fuck the public.
[1:01:14] <$Ziegsy> Pat comes back red socking it
[1:01:17] <derap41> @RealThiele truth its pretty much just oil

[1:05:10] <HaroldDonchee> grunthor time
[1:05:11] <Symmy_> please yes
[1:05:11] <%maskedsongbird> That costume is terrible and I love it.
[1:05:12] <%Ipsenscastle> they're ALL STUPID
[1:05:12] <peachy996> Grunt if he was in C-Sec
[1:05:13] <%Mattais88> TRON
[1:05:13] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Tron Grunt
[1:05:13] <Dragovus> GRUNT HAS BECOME A GAMER PC!
[1:05:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> His dumb visor!
[1:05:15] <+BigChiefBear> i legit forgot Grunt even existed
[1:05:15] <LluthyY> big dumb, I love it!
[1:05:16] <homestylewaffles> RGB babeeeeee
[1:05:16] <RaidenRising> neon
[1:05:18] <%shadowsofpain> take Grunt and Zaeed
[1:05:21] <%bread_assassin> Garrus's alt costume is better,
[1:05:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's the worst costume in any of the games.
[1:05:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS SO COOL WDYM
[1:05:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> Like Garrus but with 2 things
[1:05:27] <$realm_forge> TRON GRUNT
[1:05:29] <Profmcstevie> He needs more RGB FOR POWER
[1:05:29] <%JobbedBone> I would have thought that was cool as a kid
[1:05:35] <LordOfThePoultry> miranda and grunt
[1:05:36] <jackelzxaa> @patstaresat grunt, garrus, miranda, thane, jack, and tali get alternate outfits
[1:05:36] <derap41> but they're worse most of the time
[1:05:37] <peachy996> Most times they're better
[1:05:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah the loyalty costumes are all good.
[1:05:45] <ValkahRoctsteel> I always used to use that Grunt costume :)
[1:05:46] <$RealThiele> Rat tail moments are great
[1:05:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Especially Miranda's.
[1:05:48] <Pookiedaexzile> I never liked that it had Cerberus logos tho
[1:05:49] <peachy996> I think Samara's Default is better tho
[1:05:52] <%ape_hawk> POD BABY AND DR WARCRIMES!
[1:06:00] <derap41> Moridin and grunt the perfect team
[1:06:00] <Omenaire> the hero freakazoid
[1:06:04] <%ironohki> So power. Such beauty. Very Shepard. Wow.
[1:06:05] <%QueequegTheater> Shep-Pat looks like a human Skeletor
[1:06:05] <TourettesPlays> Holy shit did Gief's toy just make the Half Life 1 Houndeye noise?
[1:06:07] <%justnathan18> Black suit Miranda is so much better
[1:06:11] <%maskedsongbird> @PatStaresAt I like the loyalty mission costume changes, because it's like they're wearing a uniform. I secretly think Guardians of the Galaxy ripped off that concept.
[1:06:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> Mordin and Grunt could easily be a comedy duo.
[1:06:14] <KaitlynnHere> You the bald guy
[1:06:15] <Pookiedaexzile> We haven't even gotten teh Dilf and Milf A tier Team members yet
[1:06:20] <%AncelDeLambert> good krogan
[1:06:21] <%JobbedBone> why does your character look so jermaPluto
[1:06:21] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Large son
[1:06:21] <%Dfreddy8> Now let's start
[1:06:22] <zerointelligence000> I feel like these two in a squad together is pretty awkward considering...
[1:06:26] <%apostateCourier> I never used Grunt much; his abilities just didn't bring enough to the table for me
[1:06:29] <%TIME_PUNCHER> If you try to talk while making out with clones of Grunt, you'd be speaking in Grunts
[1:06:32] <Pookiedaexzile> THane and Samara deserve their own game with out shepard
[1:06:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> Warlord is better.
[1:06:34] <%QueequegTheater> KEEP THE BLOODLINE PURE
[1:06:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> When I first read his name on the wiki I read it as Gunt
[1:06:38] <KaitlynnHere> Btw why would you willing choose a balding hairstyle?
[1:06:38] <Broken_Sonex> Grunt is honestly fucking adorable.
[1:06:43] <+BossPlayerOG> Zangeif just wants to play LUL
[1:06:45] <derap41> grunt is officially a krogan stereotype
[1:06:47] <TourettesPlays> Concussive shot ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:06:47] <%maskedsongbird> @zerointelligence000 Eh, I don't think Grunt cares about that quite as much as Wrex would.
[1:06:50] <mattdemotts> there should be an option to increase his quads
[1:06:52] <Dunmarkh> EUGENICS TIME
[1:06:57] <yeildingthought> It’s annoying how many team members start with concussive shot
[1:06:57] <%NopeBadguy> you're on normal, dude, just take the damage
[1:07:02] <%QueequegTheater> It is
[1:07:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Warlord
[1:07:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Grunt canonically sees Shepard as a parental figure. Meaning he is our son.
[1:07:05] <derap41> its not
[1:07:07] <Profmcstevie> You've lost control of your bowels and your dog
[1:07:08] <LordOfThePoultry> pureblood
[1:07:11] <+BlackIronVengarl> number go up
[1:07:12] <%QueequegTheater> BUT GOBLINS THO
[1:07:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> number go up
[1:07:13] <%StaceMcGate> listening
[1:07:14] <Pookiedaexzile> It has Warlord in the title
[1:07:14] <iosephe> damage always
[1:07:16] <%dekkitout> Listen, Linda
[1:07:17] <%radnixgar> all damage all the time
[1:07:19] <peachy996> That does not appease the Goblins
[1:07:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> I like Warlord a lot more because generally Grunt's health is so high anyway it doesn't matter.
[1:07:23] <smokey02> what difficulty is this on? not insane, correct?
[1:07:23] <$RealThiele> dont have to heal if its dead
[1:07:24] <%Ipsenscastle> I don't get why people like Grunt, he's worse than Wrex in basically every regard and he looks like a Battletoad
[1:07:26] <TourettesPlays> monkaS
[1:07:27] <SaltyAzteca> The decisionsuhhh
[1:07:28] <derap41> offense is best defense
[1:07:28] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Di what Wakka would want and pick Pureblood
[1:07:30] <%Dfreddy8> Can we start plez
[1:07:33] <KaitlynnHere> Lissen
[1:07:33] <%dekkitout> Duhshizunz
[1:07:35] <PanicSwytch> Damage go up
[1:07:36] <Dova573> Man seeing how many team members you get in the game, the limit of only being to take 2 people fucking sucks
[1:07:40] <jackelzxaa> Normal is easy mode, Hardcore is the most balanced difficulty
[1:07:43] <Pookiedaexzile> We will never start
[1:07:43] <%Ranryu692> you'll never not be at or near full on medigel
[1:07:46] <+StrikeTheErf> @Ipsenscastle grunt is my son you bastard
[1:07:47] <Pookiedaexzile> and you will love it
[1:07:49] <Dova573> LET ME TAKE ALL THEM
[1:07:50] <KaitlynnHere> Liss-en-uhh
[1:07:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Dogs are great
[1:07:56] <jackelzxaa> Insanity is stupid but hardcore is fine in all 3 games i feel
[1:07:56] <BlackStarAura> GRUNT-UH
[1:07:57] <Profmcstevie> "I love you leave me be"
[1:07:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> Grunt is always the last to die UNLESS the AI decides to trap itself inside 5 husks all attacking him at once.
[1:08:00] <SaltyAzteca> That dog gets stronger every time he retrieves his toy
[1:08:01] <Dova573> Well except the boring humnas
[1:08:02] <%maskedsongbird> @Ipsenscastle "He looks like a battletoad." You basically just answered your own question there, dude. Battletoads rule.
[1:08:04] <Dova573> humans
[1:08:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Which is when you have to save your son.
[1:08:16] <derap41> Grunt can use the shiot ass plama
[1:08:17] <%Ipsenscastle> @StrikeTheErf fisticuffs at dawn
[1:08:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> Murder machine
[1:08:19] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> OfficioPrefectusCorgi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Grunt is the Second best Krogan, Frist being Wrex
[1:08:21] <%NopeBadguy> i feel like you should bump up to hardcore just bc that's when enemies get their second health bar so defense stripping comes into play
[1:08:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RIP NPCs
[1:08:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Grunt is my son, and he will play on the Little League Football Team becauses he is in the age range
[1:08:24] <tattleworm> if you give him the geth plasma, he'll stay at range
[1:08:26] <Omenaire> lil baby grunt
[1:08:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah shotgun and assault rifle.
[1:08:27] <jackelzxaa> The mattock is amazing
[1:08:30] <derap41> Geth plama is shit
[1:08:31] <KaitlynnHere> Halo gun
[1:08:31] <%QueequegTheater> Sure fuck it why not
[1:08:33] <Bullethead1010> Man, this looks great
[1:08:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> Grunt is THE BEST squadmate against any melee enemies.
[1:08:35] <%Shubreaker> you should
[1:08:35] <%StaceMcGate> Geth is cheating and you know it
[1:08:36] <%Ipsenscastle> @maskedsongbird reasonable
[1:08:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> By far.
[1:08:38] <peachy996> Ye
[1:08:44] <+StrikeTheErf> @Ipsenscastle finna catch these tiny krogan hands
[1:08:46] <%intylerwe_trust> Pat have you seen the Kojima is BlueBoxstudios rumors!?
[1:08:48] <%maskedsongbird> So, question: is Grunt technically a child soldier?
[1:08:51] <Dova573> The mattock looks alot like a halo weapon
[1:08:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Cheating is good tho
[1:08:57] <%apostateCourier> yes
[1:08:57] <%QueequegTheater> He is a child, how dare you insult my son pat
[1:09:00] <CrypticMochi> You probably want more range with Grunt in
[1:09:02] <%apostateCourier> he is absolutely a child soldier
[1:09:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Space Crips
[1:09:08] <Omenaire> he is a wee babby
[1:09:09] <peachy996> Barefaced Turian
[1:09:10] <Broken_Sonex> I wanna see Grunt do a Brock Lesnar F5 to other Krogans
[1:09:11] <%Shubreaker> eviscerator is better for squadmates
[1:09:12] <derap41> blue stars*
[1:09:12] <tattleworm> geth shotgun on ai has them stay at long range, very un-krogan
[1:09:19] <James_Quivers> SO MANY SPACE MERCS
[1:09:20] <rudybrossard> @PatStaresAt Just got here did I miss anything?
[1:09:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Space Crips, Space Blood, Space Latin Kings
[1:09:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This mission is fun
[1:09:21] <%Reveresao> Jack is better in ME3
[1:09:23] <Pookiedaexzile> its kinda hilarous
[1:09:24] <slix3431> You are committing merc genocide
[1:09:24] <ScreamLord> I always give him the Mattock for Mid/Long Range and the Claymore for fuck off get away from me Close Range
[1:09:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's insane.
[1:09:29] <%NopeBadguy> well like there are five factions in me2
[1:09:30] <+D00msDayDan> every time you fight humans
[1:09:30] <jackelzxaa> Pat on normal: “this game is so easy and goes alot faster than i remember”
[1:09:36] <stormhawk9891> Not enough apparently
[1:09:39] <%NopeBadguy> there's bluesuns, bloodpack, eclipse, collectors, and geth
[1:09:41] <%maskedsongbird> Oh jeez, these assholes...
[1:09:41] <BlackStarAura> Barefaced Bastard
[1:09:42] <%DJFakie> Purgatory? Are you picking up The Florist?
[1:09:43] <Dova573> Grunt is a genetic freak HE AINT NORMAL
[1:09:45] <SaltyAzteca> No :)
[1:09:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> The idea that these groups could survive at all after this game is laughable.
[1:09:46] <peachy996> Yeah for all the hate she gets this mission is a fun one you can't deny
[1:09:46] <%tank7013> Speaking of did Pat ever snitch on the mercs on Omega?
[1:09:47] <%ironohki> Magical.
[1:09:50] <%Puhff> do it
[1:09:50] <%Shubreaker> squadmates don't charge the geth shotgun
[1:09:50] <James_Quivers> NO OPTION TO COMPLY
[1:09:52] <%maskedsongbird> I love telling them to fuck off.
[1:09:52] <%ape_hawk> reinquish this (points at genitals)
[1:09:52] <%ironohki> That's super great.

[1:10:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> Nope no downside.
[1:10:21] <+holyxgrale> This guy is blue suns right

[1:10:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> u shur bout dat?
[1:10:52] <%TINMANxHMx> pee in his butt
[1:10:56] <%Puhff> what a coward
[1:10:57] <%ironohki> I mean to be fair, bringing a buncha guns into a prison is a bad idea, generally speaking.
[1:10:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Why would a Criminal paint his face
[1:10:58] <$RealThiele> you would know
[1:11:01] <Pookiedaexzile> its good story telling
[1:11:01] <%machshop> oh
[1:11:03] <peachy996> Actually Barefaced means you're Untrustworthy in Turian Culture
[1:11:04] <%Pandybun> Is he the only Turian without face paint?
[1:11:04] <%QueequegTheater> @justnathan18 this is the Wild West, there's nothing but mercs and monsters
[1:11:06] <ScreamLord> I feel like Turians are less expressive in MELE than in the original
[1:11:06] <derap41> little boxes on a hillside
[1:11:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> He's not as cool as Garrus
[1:11:06] <James_Quivers> LIVE IN THE POD, EAT THE BUGS
[1:11:07] <%MidnightBurst12> Do turians shit like birds?
[1:11:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> This looks like hell
[1:11:14] <%maskedsongbird> This prison complex reminds me of Butcher Bay...
[1:11:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> Turian armor does look very toilet-y
[1:11:19] <%Puhff> how lovely
[1:11:24] <%TINMANxHMx> space prison sounds awful
[1:11:25] <derap41> @ReallyBigRocks if you like order its heaven
[1:11:29] <KaitlynnHere> “Now before you enter we ask if you could please wipe your feet” -shepherd whips out his gun- “not in a million years”
[1:11:29] <%TINMANxHMx> but then again
[1:11:30] <%ironohki> Thanks for the run down of what a shit you are, sir.
[1:11:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> This isn't really a prison. When you think about it.
[1:11:32] <%machshop> hmmm
[1:11:38] <%TINMANxHMx> sounds better than normal prison
[1:11:39] <MrPandastic> Oh yay privatized space prisons
[1:11:39] <%justnathan18> Do turians have nipples?
[1:11:43] <%Puhff> ok i guess we'll just take Jack and go then
[1:11:43] <derap41> nah sheäs a sweet heart
[1:11:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> Oh I forgot they made her Biotic Riddick
[1:11:46] <$RealThiele> oooh meanest
[1:11:47] <+ScrapKingKeita> What's the point of a cryo prison? Just execute them at that point
[1:11:48] <+holyxgrale> And edgey
[1:11:49] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt the session just started, the dm gotta start up his plot for the players
[1:11:50] <+holyxgrale> Very edgey
[1:11:50] <iosephe> I almost wish they had a few non-missions
[1:11:55] <ioci2112> so shepard is literally a cyborg, a spectre, he's armed heavily armored, and flanked by an stg operator and a krogan, and this idiot really thinks he has a chance
[1:11:57] <%maskedsongbird> @Too_Much_Nukie Yeah, more like a slave ship.
[1:11:58] <derap41> @justnathan18 birds don't so I don't thing so
[1:11:58] <James_Quivers> ANOTHER GARRUS
[1:12:00] <KaitlynnHere> @justnathan18 yes, their eyes
[1:12:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ScrapKingKeita He will explain.
[1:12:01] <+bubblebasspickles> literally garrus
[1:12:03] <+Buzzkill983> As he wears a Blue suns outfit
[1:12:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> This isn't a prison.
[1:12:04] <Broken_Sonex> @holyxgrale SUPER EDGY
[1:12:05] <%QueequegTheater> I forgot they specifically avoid pronouns to make you think Jack is some huge crazy dude
[1:12:05] <CrypticMochi> I wish.
[1:12:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> Jack, she's a psycho maniac
[1:12:05] <%Garthunox> @Too_Much_Nukie where ya gonna run to in space?
[1:12:07] <%ape_hawk> what
[1:12:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> The wardens neck is uncomfortably fleshy
[1:12:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Is she crazy or does she react too being in a bounty hunters prison correctly
[1:12:12] <BlackStarAura> LOVE YOU JACK
[1:12:14] <peachy996> Tell me about your life story Bareface Garrus
[1:12:14] <%TINMANxHMx> garrus lite
[1:12:14] <LordOfThePoultry> liar
[1:12:15] <%justnathan18> @KaitlynnHere They have SPECIAL EYES
[1:12:18] <$RealThiele> $$$ Principles $$$
[1:12:18] <%Mattais88> Might come off better if you weren't a part of merc company
[1:12:21] <%TINMANxHMx> those eyes
[1:12:26] <ScreamLord> Enjoy how OP Jack is in her cutscene because she's not NEARLY that powerful in gameplay
[1:12:27] <James_Quivers> There's like 4 Garrus' across the series
[1:12:29] <%ainzhelm> Lawful evil garrus
[1:12:32] <%NopeBadguy> i feel like turians are just fascists or anarchists and there's no inbetween
[1:12:32] <KaitlynnHere> @justnathan18 extra sensitive
[1:12:32] <+vaderxyz1970> Does Pat dislike jack so much that he won't do her loyalty mission on purpose
[1:12:35] <%shadowsofpain> Garrus all the way down
[1:12:36] <zerointelligence000> This is Garrus but shitty in every way
[1:12:41] <tattleworm> did shepard have two sets of arms just now
[1:12:41] <derap41> Its basically Guantanamo which btw is still open
[1:12:43] <$SGrim> For-profit Prisons to escape Fascism?
[1:12:47] <%ironohki> @ScreamLord This is why I don't hate her, but I don't like her.
[1:12:47] <Alzero83> Someone gives this man a DEATHNOTE
[1:12:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> This isn't Guantanamo.
[1:12:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is an extortion racket.
[1:12:56] <%Alazull> Hey look it's time for Jack
[1:13:01] <derap41> Jack is fucking great
[1:13:02] <$RealThiele> noone would say "cut corners"

[1:13:08] <trianglehat> LUL
[1:13:11] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:13:11] <%ainzhelm> Garrus is the origarmi killer
[1:13:11] <%maskedsongbird> That's some reasoning I can get behind.
[1:13:14] <stantheman_97> turians are just like this
[1:13:15] <rudybrossard> Does the in game music sound off pitch for some reason?
[1:13:17] <%jillpilled> LUL
[1:13:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Jack in ME3 is genuinely great.
[1:13:20] <viewtifulr> good shit pat
[1:13:22] <James_Quivers> And them tell them to bang each other in ME3
[1:13:22] <%idyota> jack is best girl

[1:13:27] <%cvp5127> Prorities
[1:13:27] <thetunnelhomer> Wow, this prison makes no sense.
[1:13:27] <%QueequegTheater> Grunt sounds impressed
[1:13:29] <ioci2112> jack is great in me3, but she kinda sucks in me2 (except her romance scene)
[1:13:31] <KaitlynnHere> Oh yea I remember
[1:13:31] <peachy996> Nah that's just how the music is
[1:13:31] <Lamokmok> Shut those bitches up!
[1:13:33] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah see, this isn't a prison. This is an elaborate extortion racket.
[1:13:33] <%JohnAtDawn> NO ITS NOT WTF PAT
[1:13:34] <SaltyAzteca> its an unbeatable strat
[1:13:34] <Pookiedaexzile> People remember jack as smeone totallly different
[1:13:35] <Broken_Sonex> YEAH FUCK YOU AND YOUR PISSING CONTEST
[1:13:35] <%ainzhelm> Also jack citadel stuff
[1:13:36] <%luftraumm1> I had a serious crush on jack
[1:13:38] <anAngryHamster> BUt Jack was totally in the right for hating Miranda and her Cerberus loving ass
[1:13:39] <%justnathan18> ME3 Jack is like a different character, which is a good choice.
[1:13:41] <tattleworm> yeah, me3 jack is cool and good
[1:13:41] <ScreamLord> Space Guantanamo
[1:13:43] <%maskedsongbird> So it's SPACE AUSTRALIA

[1:13:56] <$Dungeon00X> That's the best idea ever
[1:13:56] <+Buzzkill983> ME3 Jack is pretty alright
[1:13:56] <%justnathan18> God I wish he had brought Miranda lol
[1:13:57] <%JohnAtDawn> MAN SURE IS A LOT OF REHAB GOING ON IN THIS PRISON
[1:13:59] <ScreamLord> Jack is a WAY better character in ME3
[1:14:00] <$SGrim> @JohnAtDawn It's effective, not morally justifiable, but effective.
[1:14:07] <LluthyY> sometimes i like jack sometimes i hate her lol
[1:14:09] <%ape_hawk> SPACE ALCATRAZ
[1:14:09] <peachy996> Mordin is also a looker

[1:19:46] <Dunmarkh> @Wallabri that guy is 403 not 430
[1:19:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> And 3 does a good job of combining the two different tones and says that the terminus systems are just so much worse.
[1:19:53] <%Jeemukun> they do!
[1:19:56] <unrolls> Still better than southern ontario!
[1:19:57] <+senfood> "I just committed a bit of mass murder. You know, as a treat."

[1:20:01] <%ape_hawk> wheres prisoner 420?
[1:20:01] <xcompleasedad> @butthurtdave I think he's been loving it. 3 is gonna be GREAT.
[1:20:02] <+LionKagura> 403

[1:20:05] <%Dfreddy8> There's nothing
[1:20:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> I live in Calgary and 430 is not the area code for Calgary
[1:20:09] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL
[1:20:09] <peachy996> Grunt has a good line when he sees Jack

[1:20:10] <%Mattais88> Always wanting to seperate from canada
[1:20:11] <SmartAssPawn089> ME definitely needed a Section 31, 2 did it so well
[1:20:12] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Why do the land-locked middles of countries suck so much dick?

[1:20:20] <Badgerconda_> the prairies do suck, i know because I live here.
[1:20:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Did they put this waist high cover here to die?
[1:20:21] <%QueequegTheater> @Dunmarkh Calgary is 403
[1:20:23] <%StaceMcGate> that was just Garrus

[1:20:36] <Symmy_> doenst he get bigger in 3?
[1:20:36] <NeroInfinite> He's a babby
[1:20:36] <+senfood> GOOD POINT
[1:20:36] <%maskedsongbird> @butthurtdave I don't understand how Vanguard could be overwhelming; shoot off shields and armor, then use the ram ability to get right up in their face and curbstomp them in the dick. It's great!
[1:20:37] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This one's for you Morph
[1:20:38] <Dunmarkh> @QueequegTheater man was wrong but also right
[1:20:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Grunt is like a teenager in Krogan years. Hasn't hit puberty yet.
[1:20:39] <%Ranryu692> he's a child soldier
[1:20:40] <%dekkitout> Cause he voiced Wolverine
[1:20:40] <LordOfThePoultry> he baby
[1:20:40] <homestylewaffles> little brat krogan
[1:20:40] <%Ipsenscastle> Grunt is giant in his intro scene and then tiny thereafter

[1:21:25] <derap41> Time to murder working stiffs
[1:21:28] <peachy996> This combat theme is good too
[1:21:29] <televisedrevolting> How does anyone think they can kill Shepard?
[1:21:31] <scrumbotime> "systems" is just some guys you can shoot, instead of y'know, like, locking the place down because it's a prison
[1:21:33] <karl_rex> He called me on my bullshit kill him
[1:21:33] <Pookiedaexzile> What a stretch

[1:21:54] <+london_flexing> The premise for this mission holds up so well
[1:21:55] <ketchuo13> Anyone know the difficulty?
[1:21:56] <%maskedsongbird> Punch it until it explodes. Is Shepard secretly related to the Redfields?
[1:21:57] <BlackStarAura> How the fuck is that a renegade option? He’s a barefaced shit
[1:22:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> imagine that guy just howling in his helmet while you pump some shotgun blasts into it. yeesh
[1:22:01] <butthurtdave> @PatStaresAt  I was replaying this game and if you don't have a Romance in place by a certain time after completing his loyalty mission, Mordin thinks you're attracted to him
[1:22:02] <ScreamLord> All the Geth guns looks great
[1:22:02] <%The_Review_Corps> NO ROBOGEIF
[1:22:03] <+pmtriox> krogan shotgun is only shotgun
[1:22:12] <bluespams7> Trying the lock up the canonically most dangerous person in the galaxy probably isn’t a good idea
[1:22:12] <%QueequegTheater> I want a pet Loki mech
[1:22:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> mordin and grunt look a while gen better than the Shepard model
[1:22:17] <xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt Is the new shotty better than the geth shotty?
[1:22:20] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt do the robot dogs mine Doge coin?
[1:22:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat you might want to shot them first
[1:22:25] <%QueequegTheater> Pissbaby elbow of doom
[1:22:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> @butthurtdave He's joking he doesn't actually think that.
[1:22:26] <DSD24> Women do find scars attractive
[1:22:30] <TourettesPlays> Wait can the squadmates charge up the geth shotgun or does it always fire a charged shot or what
[1:22:34] <xcompleasedad> LUL
[1:22:34] <$RealThiele> shepard loves the white phosphorus
[1:22:35] <derap41> @Pookiedaexzile Its almost like half of modern slavery is performed by the prison industrial complex
[1:22:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Or not
[1:22:41] <%logoth_> What was that technicians plan??
[1:22:43] <DSD24> Wow he had no chance
[1:22:43] <+StrikeTheErf> @abelincoln_catpuncher that's because custom shepard looks a gen worse than default shepard
[1:22:44] <%justnathan18> Nobody mines Doge anymore
[1:22:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> They can't charge it up, that's the normal shot.

[1:24:56] <%Garthunox> gobolins
[1:24:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can also just rotate your camera and you'll highlight the collectibles.

[1:25:16] <viewtifulr> oog big branch of people just died
[1:25:16] <%maskedsongbird> F
[1:25:17] <derap41> @cobalt_phoenix_ any ammor specialization is broken if stated right
[1:25:18] <Profmcstevie> ...not my fault
[1:25:18] <%jillpilled> Oopsy
[1:25:18] <%NateyBeak> warden goofed up
[1:25:19] <BurdRightsActivist> WHOOPS.
[1:25:20] <%QueequegTheater> To be fair those are all big serial killers
[1:25:22] <SaltyAzteca> "Oh no my fundi-I mean prisoners!"
[1:25:22] <Chaos_Aether> Are YOU Pat\
[1:25:23] <%TIME_PUNCHER> True Paragon
[1:25:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Whatever it takes.
[1:25:27] <%dekkitout> Grunt may have found his match
[1:25:28] <BurdRightsActivist> PARAGON, BTW
[1:25:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Pissed off JAck> than Soccer Mom Jack
[1:25:32] <%SinnerEbru> @SinnerEbru no man its cool, she does for me too i Get it
[1:25:33] <+JaseAdrift> Jack rips and tears
[1:25:33] <falyden> this prison section reminds me of Xenogears' Solaris honeycomb prisons
[1:25:39] <jorniev> PARAGPN
[1:25:43] <%Ipsenscastle> Jack is just a bad Wolverine expy
[1:25:43] <%Cykron> I'd be terrified to live on a ship with that
[1:25:47] <BurdRightsActivist> This looks so good, holy shit
[1:25:47] <ketchuo13> If only she was like this. Then I would bring her along
[1:25:47] <%bananasMAXIMUM> bananasMAXIMUM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! I forgot I was sub to you lol. enjoy the money
[1:25:48] <DSD24> Nah man Soccer Mom Jack is way better
[1:25:52] <$Dungeon00X> Everybody in chat who hasn't played this game, you are in for a treat.
[1:25:54] <%dekkitout> Is Jack just Pam
[1:25:55] <HaroldDonchee> @sociopathicape yeah it's totally boss when you fight them vs boss when they join your party
[1:25:57] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, like shooting out ping pong balls
[1:25:57] <Pookiedaexzile> I don't care if she makes your dick feel less smal in ME3, In ME2 she's the best
[1:25:59] <Symmy_> actually good point
[1:26:00] <$RealThiele> ssshhhhhippp
[1:26:00] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is it a sin to get a pre-marital biotic handy
[1:26:02] <KeystoneA2> This station is the space eqivalent of Black Dolphin; they all deserve it
[1:26:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> Charge is so fucking broken.
[1:26:13] <Symmy_> why doesnt the warder just airlock everyone
[1:26:14] <%justnathan18> Jack is like Hellboy's girlfriend...but like all Hot Topic'd out.
[1:26:18] <%Ipsenscastle> that said, I agree ME3 Jack is somewhat more interesting
[1:26:19] <rudybrossard> How come none of them have Shields or Armor ?
[1:26:20] <%cvp5127> is jack just kaine
[1:26:22] <butthurtdave> known bug
[1:26:27] <derap41> @Too_Much_Nukie biotics in general are broken
[1:26:27] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile You're really going hard on this huh?
[1:26:31] <%pokefan9956> not doin strive on stream anymore?
[1:26:32] <+JaseAdrift> Jack is nothing like hellboy's girlfriend
[1:26:35] <%Cykron> Jack is into edging and orgasm denial
[1:26:38] <%machshop> thanks mordin
[1:26:40] <$RealThiele> bop
[1:26:42] <Chaos_Aether> gg
[1:26:46] <Chaos_Aether> no
[1:26:49] <%bananasMAXIMUM> always
[1:26:50] <Goraka91> On a unrelated note i'm doing Shadowbringers and man that second part of Amh Araeng is boring
[1:26:51] <%ironohki> Why didn't the warden just open the airlock? Seems like that would actually cut his losses at this point.
[1:26:51] <DSD24> Hahahaha
[1:26:53] <%BarujaraciGaming> @ipsenscastle but that requires being good and not letting everyone die at the end of 2 lol
[1:26:53] <xcompleasedad> Everyone is dying
[1:26:53] <Chaos_Aether> NO!!
[1:26:54] <BurdRightsActivist> Nice one mordinn
[1:26:55] <%crazyspartan214> NO
[1:26:55] <%ExpressNode> Tired from work but good
[1:26:55] <Archmortal> it's a fairly common bug that becomes more common in the end-game that Charge fails to target
[1:26:55] <%machshop> holler
[1:26:57] <wolfen091> I always forget that pat is playing memeboy vanguard
[1:26:58] <rudybrossard> bip bop
[1:26:59] <%bananasMAXIMUM> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:26:59] <SaltyAzteca> Grunt is enjoying himself
[1:27:00] <DSD24> He said that as soon as a dude was creaming
[1:27:00] <$lumporr> doing SOMETHING
[1:27:03] <+zuzuxiv> grunt is just gief
[1:27:03] <%QueequegTheater> I want to give Grunt hugs
[1:27:04] <$RealThiele> sectors 7, 9, and 11 are not doing good
[1:27:04] <SmartAssPawn089> Pat Steiner?
[1:27:05] <peachy996> Wasn't expecting so much Pro Jack vs Anti Jack in chat
[1:27:05] <Caleboverton> HOLLER IF YER DEAD
[1:27:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "is everyone okay" *distant screams*
[1:27:07] <DSD24> screaming I mean
[1:27:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> @derap41 They did try to balance them somewhat by making it so they don't work if the enemy has shields..
[1:27:07] <BurdRightsActivist> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:27:08] <%justnathan18> Not doing great cap
[1:27:12] <%Cykron> Pat is now a DBZ character
[1:27:16] <QuestlordJake> the prisoners aren't doin good
[1:27:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> based mordin
[1:27:25] <Symmy_> COULD be?
[1:27:26] <%machshop> how did they improvise them so fast aren't they frozen
[1:27:29] <%bananasMAXIMUM> dolla dolla bills yall
[1:27:31] <Samurai_Tchan> playing all over again ???
[1:27:35] <Samurai_Tchan> reseted ?
[1:27:37] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt if garrus is here, mordin and him actually get into an argument about that
[1:27:38] <NeroInfinite> YA THINK MORDIN?
[1:27:40] <Drunkengen> Retribution
[1:27:44] <Profmcstevie> Nothing gets past me OSFrog
[1:27:45] <James_Quivers> Mordin is just an agent of chaos in general
[1:27:48] <derap41> @Too_Much_Nukie haha Disruptor ammo goes brrrrrr
[1:27:49] <$RealThiele> @machshop shutup tho
[1:27:50] <Samurai_Tchan> I should talk like mordin
[1:27:51] <%dekkitout> Beeg hax
[1:27:58] <TourettesPlays> If you say "two wrongs dont make a right" to Mordin he WILL shoot you in the face
[1:28:00] <rudybrossard> I wish there were more of that
[1:28:05] <wolfen091> left
[1:28:05] <%mike2hands> NotLikeThis
[1:28:06] <rudybrossard> there's not a lot
[1:28:12] <derap41> They all have extra dialog but its all the same in the end
[1:28:15] <Pookiedaexzile> It's almost like they understood what people wanted
[1:28:16] <%Cykron> Companion conflict is always cool
[1:28:16] <%dekkitout> More games need that, but we exist in hell
[1:28:17] <peachy996> Makes for good replayability
[1:28:19] <$Dungeon00X> That is my favorite thing about Mass Effect.
[1:28:20] <DSD24> Positives of having a big cast
[1:28:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Gears of Talk
[1:28:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Just wait for 3 when your crew starts having conversations on the Normandy without Shepard.
[1:28:26] <rudybrossard> usually they say mostly the same thing
[1:28:28] <%AzureGale> Being good at my what
[1:28:31] <%idyota> If you take jack on Miranda's loyalty mission she talks mad shit
[1:28:33] <xcompleasedad> Isn't it relatively easy to program, or am I very wrong?
[1:28:37] <%Cykron> INSTANT TRANSMISSION
[1:28:40] <%crazyspartan214> oh well
[1:28:49] <Archmortal> It's a hell of a lot better than ME1's dialogue priority where Tali is just rock bottom to say anything
[1:28:52] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It also matters who you pick first in the character select.
[1:28:52] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Make sure to take Jack on Miranda's loyalty mission
[1:28:53] <TourettesPlays> Who told Jack Wall he could go that hard holy fuck
[1:28:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack on Mirandas mission is 25 percent of why I like her
[1:28:59] <rudybrossard> Yeah it does that sometimes
[1:28:59] <derap41> @xcompleasedad check out dialog compilation and it shows how easy it is
[1:29:02] <$RealThiele> biotic charrrrrrge
[1:29:05] <%justnathan18> If Jack is this strong how did she get locked up in the first place
[1:29:07] <%Garthunox> SPEEN
[1:29:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> If you take Zaeed on Jacob's mission Zaeed tries to justify Jacob's Dad's rape cult.
[1:29:12] <wolfen091> @idyota idk why i never thought to do that... next playthrough for sure
[1:29:13] <Samurai_Tchan> releasing riddick
[1:29:17] <%bassoontyphoon> my only major rule of thumb is to take squad members who hate each other on their loyalty missions
[1:29:19] <BlackStarAura> ME2’s music is FIRE
[1:29:27] <%justnathan18> @Too_Much_Nukie Thats kind of hilarious
[1:29:33] <DSD24> Oh ME2 has the best music
[1:29:36] <%justnathan18> Its so out of touch
[1:29:37] <rudybrossard> @justnathan18 Nice HAHAHA
[1:29:37] <%Ipsenscastle> @Too_Much_Nukie holy shit
[1:29:41] <%dekkitout> @justnathan18 She was lured into cryo with pringles
[1:29:41] <%Cykron> @BlackStarAura Suicide Mission is one of the best tracks in video games
[1:29:42] <KeystoneA2> ded
[1:29:43] <SaltyAzteca> So greedy
[1:29:44] <derap41> woah eat shit
[1:29:44] <%AzureGale> DED
[1:29:45] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:29:45] <slix3431> LUL
[1:29:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> F
[1:29:46] <%ExpressNode> Really
[1:29:47] <Pookiedaexzile> That's a machine pistol not a sub machine gun
[1:29:49] <DSD24> Critical Mission Failure
[1:29:49] <tubit> You ded
[1:29:51] <%Alazull> You were pinned down dawg
[1:29:51] <Lamokmok> F
[1:29:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> pat lmao
[1:29:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AND THATS SHEPARDS STORY
[1:29:53] <%Ipsenscastle> try using squad powers sometimes
[1:29:53] <%bread_assassin> @justnathan18 They captured Gameplay Jack not Story Jack. Kappa
[1:29:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Zaeed is great because he's a piece of shit.
[1:29:56] <%NopeBadguy> what was your first clue, the sound going out or the blood on your screen?
[1:29:58] <rudybrossard> Why am I not surprised
[1:29:59] <Goraka91> MORTIS
[1:30:06] <%jillpilled> @too_much_nukie Zaede went all in on that renegade side of the wheel I see LUL
[1:30:07] <BlackStarAura> I always take Miranda on Jack’s loyalty mission. Next time I’ll take Jack on Miranda’s
[1:30:12] <%Cykron> WE ALL FALL DOWN SOMETIMES
[1:30:14] <%ape_hawk> i dont; im perfect
[1:30:15] <%bassoontyphoon> Ooopsie wooopsie
[1:30:18] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Unless you do Kasumi's loyalty mission right away it takes a LONG time to get a decent SMG
[1:30:18] <%FFXIVsFreeTrial> the intense lighting on shepard's face in this area makes him look like a cro magnon
[1:30:26] <SaltyAzteca> DEAD BATARIAN
[1:30:27] <Profmcstevie> Why do we die Bruce
[1:30:27] <%Alazull> This section got me a few times back in the day since they can flank you super easy out there
[1:30:29] <derap41> @BlackStarAura those two should just kiss already
[1:30:34] <peachy996> I take Grunt for Jack because he gets hype
[1:30:37] <Symmy_> Sucks bein forced into ranged combat only on a close range weapon class
[1:30:42] <%Cykron> This game is primarily a shooter
[1:30:44] <MrPandastic> Its night and day
[1:30:48] <rudybrossard> @BlackStarAura There's no squad talk during MIranda's mission ... :(
[1:30:48] <%AzureGale> POWER WAVE
[1:30:51] <%ainzhelm> This mission is actually in the demo. You go here right after leaving the Cerberus lab. Pretty solid for a demo
[1:30:54] <%Cykron> Yeah
[1:30:57] <%dekkitout> Yeah!
[1:31:04] <Pookiedaexzile> You're not forced tho, if you Charge into better cover
[1:31:06] <%The_Review_Corps> 3 feels better just story falls apart
[1:31:07] <derap41> at least Mordin is having fun
[1:31:12] <jorniev> wow jack fucked this place up
[1:31:16] <%Cykron> @ainzhelm I played that demo like 50 times
[1:31:22] <%AzureGale> We'll end it qui- next!
[1:31:25] <peachy996> @rudybrossard Take Jack along on her Loyalty Mission
[1:31:33] <Vicviper909> Jack 💜💜💜💜
[1:31:33] <DSD24> There are some good stuff in ME3
[1:31:36] <SaltyAzteca> HE'S LOVIN IT
[1:31:38] <%ainzhelm> @cykron It’s why I checked out the series
[1:31:38] <%ape_hawk> RIGHT ON YOUR ASS
[1:31:41] <%Cykron> Grunt is an infant remember
[1:31:44] <peachy996> She shoots an Eclipse merc and says how she likes the enemy
[1:31:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's a lot of good stuff in 3.
[1:31:45] <falyden> God I love this lines
[1:31:46] <+TopTieramisu> hmmmm
[1:31:48] <%dekkitout> Grunt is appreciating the ultraviolence
[1:31:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's just also stuff that is very bad.
[1:31:53] <derap41> you'd think these paid guards would just accept the loss at this point
[1:31:55] <falyden> on the ground now!!!
[1:32:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat charges into bad cover again
[1:32:13] <%Cykron> Big plays for big boys
[1:32:20] <ScreamLord> Child ABuse
[1:32:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> This whole mission is so much easier as an infiltrator.
[1:32:21] <%ainzhelm> @derap41 goons gonna goon
[1:32:22] <%ape_hawk> but pat, grunt IS a baby
[1:32:25] <rudybrossard> @peachy996 it's weird how some mission are fully voice acted and other don't have any beside Shepard and the character concerned by the misison
[1:32:26] <Broken_Sonex> SUCK IT UP GRUNT
[1:32:27] <SaltyAzteca> GRUUUUNT Kreygasm
[1:32:27] <ioci2112> I swear half my deaths in me2 are because shepard refuses to charge an enemy who is right in from of him
[1:32:28] <Chaos_Aether> Dont hit you team mates
[1:32:28] <%Cykron> Yeah punch the mech
[1:32:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's all made for long-distance.
[1:32:32] <slix3431> Child abuse
[1:32:35] <%eyezehuhh> i mean he is baby
[1:32:39] <SaltyAzteca> Saved you there Shepat
[1:32:41] <Pookiedaexzile> This isn't made for long distance
[1:32:45] <Goraka91> I want to see what actual baby krogan look like
[1:32:46] <Pookiedaexzile> they put in a Flanking path
[1:32:47] <Pookiedaexzile> for you
[1:32:57] <$Dungeon00X> Unreal Engine 3, it was fantastic for this.
[1:33:04] <$realm_forge> stop shooting the 800lb alien Dino child
[1:33:05] <derap41> @ainzhelm Still these guys are not bad guys just wardens
[1:33:08] <Vicviper909> psaCrazy
[1:33:16] <peachy996> Samara's is weirdest one
[1:33:21] <rudybrossard> Well this one. there's a lot it's mostly loyalty and side missions
[1:33:25] <%apostateCourier> they are absolutely bad guys
[1:33:25] <peachy996> Takes unusually long
[1:33:26] <derap41> Ain't no moral victory here
[1:33:27] <Samurai_Tchan> grunt is already awakened ?
[1:33:28] <BlackStarAura> @goraka91 One of the ME3 endings showed a baby KROGAN
[1:33:30] <Pookiedaexzile> That side Path is for short range guys, the High path is for long range guys to snipe, and the middle road is a mix
[1:33:30] <%justnathan18> Samara's mission is...odd
[1:33:32] <rudybrossard> all the main missions are voice acted
[1:33:32] <%ironohki> Pat so good at vidja
[1:33:34] <%Garthunox> @ainzhelm So why'd they try and capture you?
[1:33:35] <Pookiedaexzile> they do that alot in this games design
[1:33:35] <%machshop> wtf
[1:33:36] <ScreamLord> In the Overlord DLC NOBODY talks except Shepard and the scientist guy. You're squadmates are completely silent
[1:33:37] <%ainzhelm> @derap41 What are you talking about? They are blue sun
[1:33:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> @derap41 They're very bad guys the fuck you talking about? They capture criminals then hold them for ransom from their home worlds.
[1:33:48] <Symmy_> nice noscope
[1:33:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> @derap41 They also sell these criminals to interested parties.
[1:33:55] <%za7az> Wow....
[1:33:56] <%Garthunox> @ainzhelm If they werent bad they wouldnt try and stop you
[1:33:57] <%dekkitout> CAN you?
[1:34:01] <%Cykron> Look at John Wayne over here
[1:34:03] <+D00msDayDan> he's firing that machine gun single shot
[1:34:05] <%justnathan18> Imagine giving Garrus that armor shit
[1:34:05] <%SinnerEbru> wasnt this a bug in the old one too???
[1:34:07] <derap41> I'm having the best time right now
[1:34:07] <%Cykron> Those hip shots
[1:34:09] <$SGrim> I AM THE 3%
[1:34:09] <BlackStarAura> FUCK YOU KYRIL
[1:34:09] <+pre10cious_1> No u
[1:34:10] <Pookiedaexzile> They do it in this room too if you look theres 3 paths to the boss
[1:34:14] <derap41> Pat gets it
[1:34:14] <Symmy_> Civil goverments unwilling to slavery?
[1:34:16] <SaltyAzteca> And HOW is imprisoning Shepard good for the galaxy?
[1:34:17] <%za7az> This dude is fuckin nuts!
[1:34:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup
[1:34:18] <Samurai_Tchan> wow , garrus is the villain
[1:34:19] <%NopeBadguy> i dunno man, civil governments have done a lot of slavery
[1:34:20] <+zuzuxiv> oh
[1:34:20] <s1rcuit> so you can do that minigame quickly when you realize that the matching symbols are on the same paths
[1:34:20] <%JobbedBone> D: pixar villain
[1:34:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Also notice this guy wants to SELL YOU.
[1:34:20] <DSD24> He would hate running a prison
[1:34:21] <+vaderxyz1970> SLAVERY FOR THE PEOPLE
[1:34:23] <Profmcstevie> Garrus without a Shepard
[1:34:24] <ScreamLord> What if Garrus was also greedy?
[1:34:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> Shepard isn't a criminal.
[1:34:29] <Goraka91> It's NECESSARY slavery you don't understand!
[1:34:30] <Pookiedaexzile> or you could charge into the middle of the room
[1:34:31] <%machshop> i love batarian screams
[1:34:35] <%shadowsofpain> This is Garrus if he never met Shepard
[1:34:35] <slix3431> White phosphorus is great you guys
[1:34:35] <%dekkitout> Garry of Christmas Future
[1:34:37] <%Cykron> Garrus has more of a killboner
[1:34:37] <%ainzhelm> @garthunox you talking to me?
[1:34:39] <BurdRightsActivist> Holy shit those screams
[1:34:40] <jorniev> what does garrus say about all of this?
[1:34:44] <rudybrossard> Blue sons lives matters
[1:34:49] <BurdRightsActivist> woah, hey guys
[1:34:50] <+Buzzkill983> The Batarians told me I can use slavery for my prison money
[1:34:50] <ARDM112> Asshole or not, Garrus is not known for taking prisoners LUL
[1:34:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Garrus hates this guy.
[1:34:53] <Goraka91> @machshop Burning batarians are just the best
[1:34:58] <%Puhff> how does a pan-galactic civilisation not have enough room for prisons? or better yet; rehab centers?
[1:34:59] <Archer336> I love how he expected for all of this to just work out pretty well and it'd never blow up in his face.
[1:35:02] <DSD24> Garrus has some good lines in this mission
[1:35:03] <Symmy_> so his plan is to sit behind his everything proof shield and do nothing
[1:35:04] <%justnathan18> @Profmcstevie If you dont recreuit  Garrus in 1. hes still arch angel in 2
[1:35:05] <peachy996> Neat gimmick at least
[1:35:06] <%Garthunox> @ainzhelm nah, the other guy
[1:35:10] <derap41> @Too_Much_Nukie The boss  does that
[1:35:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Garrus hates looking in Mirros
[1:35:12] <DSD24> Specially the last dialogue if you go Renegade
[1:35:16] <Symmy_> what if sheprad had just walked out he literally trapped himself in
[1:35:23] <%ShogunNoonto> ShogunNoonto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 26 months fuck

[1:35:30] <%machshop> @PatStaresAt look out he has a gun
[1:35:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> @derap41 These guys are all in on it. They're blue sun mercenaries. A gang that deals in slaves.
[1:35:38] <rudybrossard> Pistols are shit against shields and Barriers
[1:35:39] <Pookiedaexzile> No you don't
[1:35:57] <Pookiedaexzile> The best place for this guy is where you are
[1:35:58] <Pookiedaexzile> YEs
[1:35:59] <%machshop> LUL
[1:36:01] <NeroInfinite> @Puhff It's not that they don't have room for prisoners, it's that they don't want to deal with certian criminals.
[1:36:06] <%ironohki> Calling in probiotic support! (sends yogurt)
[1:36:06] <Pookiedaexzile> This is how I beat him

[1:40:05] <%SirGO0SE> id even prefer pasties
[1:40:06] <%VHGS> Her nips must be SCREAMING

[1:40:14] <%jillpilled> It looks really goofy it's true
[1:40:14] <dreu81> She should just be topless. More in character.
[1:40:15] <%eyezehuhh> she has an alt customer
[1:40:16] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Wait till you see Jack in ME3
[1:40:16] <Daniel_Is_I> She looks like a Psycho from Borderlands
[1:40:18] <viewtifulr> looks like something cage came up with
[1:40:18] <rudybrossard> DLC
[1:40:19] <blackjack8182> She can

[1:40:20] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Squad Status at your Personal Terminal
[1:40:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CYBERPUNK JACK
[1:40:21] <knight_verse> @mrathegreat She is Bi, you wpuld know that if you read her dialogue.
[1:40:21] <%Dfreddy8> Cabin and crew
[1:40:22] <TourettesPlays> Catty Patty, the fashion critic LUL LUL
[1:40:24] <Zalapski> oh go to a mission first
[1:40:25] <%tank7013> But Pat you can't stick it to the MAN with a shirt
[1:40:26] <%Garthunox> You terminal
[1:40:28] <%SwdVengeance> Alt costume
[1:40:30] <srv4254> remember breaking up a cat fight is the hardest stat check in the game
[1:40:32] <$Dungeon00X> Ooo
[1:40:32] <+holyxgrale> warning, it looks weird
[1:40:33] <blackjack8182> You can change her outfit now
[1:40:34] <%justnathan18> Doesnt her DLC outfit have stupid sunglasses
[1:40:35] <%ainzhelm> YOU HAVE HER ALT OUTFIT
[1:40:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack in 3 is made tame for teenage boys
[1:40:38] <$SGrim> @VHGS She doesn't have nipples. They were removed by the ESRB.
[1:40:39] <Pookiedaexzile> I am a Man
[1:40:39] <VentWilsn> Shepard: No Shirt No Service bitch
[1:40:41] <SmartAssPawn089> Her alt is infinitely better, then they got it right in 3 IMO
[1:40:42] <+Kyma1020> she looks dumb. not punk
[1:40:46] <derap41> not really
[1:40:48] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Just the Normandy Upgrades
[1:40:48] <Virokwet> how?
[1:40:49] <rudybrossard> What no ??/
[1:40:49] <blackjack8182> Squad Status menu
[1:40:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You have to research all of them.
[1:40:53] <jorniev> i think
[1:40:54] <%afronooch> The ship upgrades do
[1:40:56] <rudybrossard> you start over in ME3
[1:40:57] <%Ipsenscastle> you wont use them anyway
[1:40:58] <+MrAtheGreat> @knight_verse Really? I thought you couldn't romance her if you played femshep.
[1:41:00] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile You can stop now
[1:41:03] <$Dungeon00X> If you want the achievements
[1:41:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> They carry over but not directly. You get different upgrades for doing them.
[1:41:06] <%afronooch> im not sure about the others
[1:41:08] <peachy996> You can give her the DLC outfit until you get her Loyalty outfit which puts a top on her
[1:41:12] <homestylewaffles> either way, money stops being a problem and you'll likely get all the upgrades anyway
[1:41:14] <%coffeeabomination> Jack's belt strap thing was inspired by dantes belt strap thing
[1:41:14] <Samurai_Tchan> jack in ME3 at least have hair
[1:41:15] <dreu81> She’s like cleopatra in Dante’s inferno. She has angry mouths for nipples.
[1:41:18] <rudybrossard> @PatStaresAt you do get a bonus from all the extra Minerals tho
[1:41:18] <%dekkitout> Shep: "Jack it's either business attire, or casual wear"
[1:41:19] <Pookiedaexzile> @Broken_Sonex You telling me that is making it worse
[1:41:24] <Symmy_> wait a second you are a biotic you dont use shields
[1:41:25] <MonsterGills> You don't need to med bay upgrade
[1:41:25] <Too_Much_Nukie> If you have your weapons upgraded in 2, the guns are upgraded when you find them in 3.
[1:41:28] <knight_verse> @mrathegreat You can't, but that doesn't make her any less Bi.
[1:41:32] <derap41> hate when games don't give a % just "sometimes"
[1:41:33] <%bread_assassin> @knight_verse She IS Bi, but FemShep still can't romance her.
[1:41:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> If you have Shephard's health upgrades here you get a health bonus in 3.
[1:41:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Etc.
[1:41:40] <%illtima> Download the mod that can eat an entire planet in one probe
[1:41:41] <NeroInfinite> words
[1:41:42] <VentWilsn> going to bounce, good luck with half naked Jack Pat
[1:41:44] <kobaltXIV> @dreu81 LUL LUL
[1:41:45] <%Ipsenscastle> The special armours would be so cool if you could just take off the damn helmets
[1:41:46] <TourettesPlays> Your skill point allocation will be carried over to 3, so make sure to reset your skill points and make a new save before playing ME3
[1:41:56] <Samurai_Tchan> Jack Belongs to the Nosferatu
[1:41:57] <%Dfreddy8> Are you talking to teammates after missions?
[1:42:00] <%justnathan18> You cant romance Jack as FemShep because of Fox News
[1:42:01] <%AzureGale> Oooooh
[1:42:07] <rudybrossard> Noooo
[1:42:09] <$Futurecity10> NO
[1:42:09] <Virokwet> yes
[1:42:10] <$lumporr> Kelly: Jack's pussy is off the charts, commander.
[1:42:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea
[1:42:11] <derap41> like it did in 1
[1:42:11] <rudybrossard> !!
[1:42:12] <$Futurecity10> THATS FALSE
[1:42:14] <+StrikeTheErf> wait what
[1:42:14] <derap41> doesn¨t really matter
[1:42:14] <stormhawk9891> No
[1:42:15] <%machshop> not really
[1:42:15] <%idyota> yeah but respec is free
[1:42:16] <rudybrossard> bunch of fucking liars
[1:42:17] <%DJFakie> Yes, but you can reset it
[1:42:18] <%AzureGale> Partially
[1:42:18] <%Ipsenscastle> kind of
[1:42:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's true
[1:42:20] <%Shubreaker> slightly
[1:42:21] <%ape_hawk> kelly, make me less tired
[1:42:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Yes 3 starts you exactly where you were at the end of 2. Level cap becomes 60.
[1:42:23] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Respec before transfering to keep your points
[1:42:25] <%machshop> your levels do not your points
[1:42:27] <%jillpilled> Sorta
[1:42:28] <%Torus1025> You start 3 at the level you end 2
[1:42:31] <rudybrossard> She's crazy
[1:42:31] <blackjack8182> Yes
[1:42:33] <%RaziWraith> this girl doesn't know anything about her tattoos if she thinks that LUL
[1:42:33] <tattleworm> if you keep the same class, it tries to keep it accurate, yeah
[1:42:35] <%Cykron> Will she?
[1:42:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Kelly: Jacks pussy is truly Popping
[1:42:39] <DSD24> She's not actually
[1:42:40] <derap41> No fucking shit Kelly
[1:42:42] <+D_A_K> go on...
[1:42:43] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Your total skill points carry over, no what you spent them on
[1:42:46] <SaltyAzteca> SHE BE VERY PHYSICAL
[1:42:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> @machshop Points only reset if you switch classes between 2 and 3.
[1:42:47] <DSD24> She folds like carboard
[1:42:51] <%NateyBeak> she's been here 5 minutes how do you KNOW she approaches sex casually
[1:42:51] <%bread_assassin> Yeah, but if you got any skills at Lv. 4 they might auto give you one of the upgrades you DON'T want.
[1:42:51] <$lumporr> NAH, THINK ONCE
[1:42:52] <+destro_223> Protect Kelly at all cost
[1:42:53] <+pre10cious_1> whooooore
[1:42:53] <peachy996> Suggests massive survivor's guilt
[1:42:55] <+Ran196> talk with Dr. Chawkas and pound that vintage pussy
[1:42:58] <%ape_hawk> yeah, people do that, kelly
[1:42:58] <SociopathicApe> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT, KELLY?
[1:42:59] <%Alazull> Chambers will call it "Jack's hidey-hole" when she sends you to talk to her
[1:42:59] <%Cykron> IF SHE GETS YOUR DICK SHE'LL HATE YOU
[1:42:59] <knight_verse> Check out Jacks dlc outfit.
[1:43:01] <radioamnesiac> NO NEED, I DON'T WANT HER RESPECT THANKS
[1:43:01] <Badgerconda_> DON'T GET SPACE AIDS
[1:43:01] <derap41> Don't go for the Puss pat
[1:43:04] <SaltyAzteca> Kelly knows whats up
[1:43:06] <spuginky> Kelly did you...
[1:43:08] <Zalapski> aaaand if I don't want her respect?
[1:43:12] <Virokwet> if you want her loyalty dont copulate
[1:43:15] <rudybrossard> doesn't Mordin say at some point that Jack had sex with a varen ?
[1:43:16] <$lumporr> "she'll propose sex immediately. good, too"
[1:43:19] <peachy996> Yeah if you do a quick romp she tells you to fuck off for the rest of the game
[1:43:24] <%BarujaraciGaming> IT'S CUZ SHE'S HOT. ALL HOT CHICKS KNOW IS TWERK, CHARGE HER BIOTIC, EAT HOT CHIP AND LIE
[1:43:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't fuck a girl going thru a mental breakdown, I can tell you this from experience
[1:43:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> @rudybrossard No
[1:43:28] <BlackStarAura> If you bring Jack to the Citadel club, she mentions getting raped in a bathroom in prison
[1:43:29] <%dekkitout> Man, Kelly is the greatest bro
[1:43:29] <+MrAtheGreat> @knight_verse Yeah, that's what I was referring to. She was supposed to be romancable by femshep but BioWare backed off because they thought it was too extreme after the sex debacle in ME1
[1:43:30] <DSD24> Cryo Ammo is great
[1:43:31] <%justnathan18> Jack getting pissed at you for banging her ends up potentially getting her killed too lmao
[1:43:34] <Samurai_Tchan> "she masturbates constantly in the back of the room, all the workers are hearing sounds, sheppard"

[1:45:43] <Broken_Sonex> REAL CLOTHES
[1:45:44] <DSD24> She got techno shades too
[1:45:46] <peachy996> Only thing I don't like are the shades
[1:45:47] <%ExpressNode> That is better like when they put a hood on Pyra
[1:45:50] <BurdRightsActivist> CYBERPUNK
[1:45:50] <blackjack8182> So much better
[1:45:50] <derap41> fair point
[1:45:50] <%MugenSandan> Literally quiet vs quiet with a shirt
[1:45:52] <%jillpilled> Without the glasses it'd be better but still great look
[1:45:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> I just wish she could remove her shades.
[1:45:57] <%maenos2> NEON IS BEST, YAY TRON LINES

[1:46:00] <derap41> agrree'
[1:46:00] <James_Quivers> Edginess
[1:46:01] <Pookiedaexzile> but this is nice
[1:46:01] <fugly_nick> The damaged armor is cool though
[1:46:02] <rudybrossard> It's so stupid that his armor is always broken
[1:46:03] <%Alazull> For the ladies
[1:46:03] <%AzureGale> A reminder of his failure
[1:46:04] <tattleworm> too busy calibratin'
[1:46:04] <%cvp5127> its cool
[1:46:05] <%JobbedBone> petina
[1:46:05] <%Ipsenscastle> what makes even less sense is his new loyalty armour is still busted
[1:46:05] <%shadowsofpain> he does in 3
[1:46:06] <%dekkitout> "It reflects my soul, Shep. DAMAGED!!"
[1:46:06] <Symmy_> buys new armor and makes the same hole its a part of his "style" now
[1:46:07] <$Dungeon00X> I'm fairly certain you get the necessary Platinum to fully upgrade everything through side missions.
[1:46:07] <%eyezehuhh> CYBERPUNK
[1:46:08] <%justnathan18> Hes too busy doing calibrations
[1:46:09] <+MrAtheGreat> Right? He spends all of his time below deck but isn't fixing his armor?
[1:46:09] <+Data7lorE> a reminder :(
[1:46:09] <+Cactuskris> he's Damaged
[1:46:09] <rudybrossard> it pisses me off too
[1:46:10] <viewtifulr> scar to impress the ladies

[1:46:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because Garrus is cool.
[1:46:13] <peachy996> Isn't the Loyalty Garrus just a reshade too
[1:46:14] <Samurai_Tchan> his armor is biological
[1:46:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No
[1:46:15] <Ekaelis> Especially since it works against gunfire like it did in his mission
[1:46:16] <+D00msDayDan> so he can remember sidonis

[1:46:19] <%The_Review_Corps> chicks dig scars
[1:46:20] <blackjack8182> I don’t like the damaged armor
[1:46:21] <%embranz> my headcanon was he wore it as a reminder to not let his guard down and get betrayed again @PatStaresAt
[1:46:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Garrus would totally not repair his armor
[1:46:31] <+MrAtheGreat> There's a massive freraking hole that leads straight to his head what're ya doing man
[1:46:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Damaged Armour isnt cool
[1:46:34] <dredgyboi> jack is the best human crewmate
[1:46:35] <%Arancet> why is shepard the only one with casual clothes? having the commander being the only one on ship in a hoodie is super weird
[1:46:38] <Samurai_Tchan> HIS VISSION IS ARGUMENTED
[1:46:40] <DSD24> Hey its Steve again
[1:46:42] <SaltyAzteca> YOU TELL EM GRUNT SPIEGEL
[1:46:44] <%ironohki> @Pookiedaexzile He's too busy calibrating.
[1:46:46] <derap41> LUL these crewmates are dead
[1:46:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Arancet Pat did that to be fair.

[1:47:05] <viewtifulr> sim1L sim1R
[1:47:07] <derap41> EDI does look like a sex toy

[1:47:25] <$Dungeon00X> doodStare
[1:47:26] <derap41> oh Joker gona grease her up alright
[1:47:26] <viewtifulr> that he will
[1:47:29] <%weissguard> I mean, Garrus just wants Shepard to have a chance with the ladies. That's why he doesn't get the face repaired.
[1:47:32] <%justnathan18> Jack is Shadow the Hedgehog
[1:47:33] <$lumporr> Fuck University

[1:48:05] <%AzureGale> Shepard is best dad
[1:48:06] <$Dungeon00X> Haha, Seth Green was the best choice for Joker.

[1:48:09] <Tonicky > Joker doesn't want them to know he is bad talk them lol
[1:48:09] <%ironohki> Shepard.

[1:48:13] <James_Quivers> You gotta wait for the PRIIIIIZE SHepard
[1:48:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> He doesn't cast a shadow
[1:48:14] <+Daigrey> Elusive man first
[1:48:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> @weissguard But the fucked up face makes Garrus WAY hotter
[1:48:15] <IntrepidEye> Shepard
[1:48:16] <tranquilturnip> threatening: we'll talk later
[1:48:16] <SaltyAzteca> Is Garrus gonna be doing c a l i b r a t i o n s?
[1:48:16] <Seth_Tek> we'll bang okay
[1:48:17] <%logoth_> Wrex
[1:48:17] <blackjack8182> It’s terrible
[1:48:19] <falyden> officer bland
[1:48:19] <%jillpilled> Taking advantage of his super flexible neck
[1:48:19] <DSD24> ME3 its much better so it helps
[1:48:21] <Samurai_Tchan> he runs like hitman
[1:48:23] <%snow_bush> But I am big about forcing you out the airlock Jacob

[1:48:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> @lumporr He's big on cheating
[1:48:44] <karl_rex> Why does Shepard dance the way he does? The ability to save the galaxy comes at the cost of proper head tracking and dancing
[1:48:47] <James_Quivers> Considering what we know about ME3, OOF
[1:48:49] <BlackStarAura> BioWare really did Jacob’s character dirty. Horrible writing
[1:48:54] <murdocismyhero> To bad they are all going to die
[1:48:55] <%machshop> oh it's very light
[1:48:57] <tranquilturnip> is earth a paradise or a disaster zone in this timeline
[1:48:59] <Symmy_> For the good of humantiy of course
[1:49:01] <jorniev> that ended up being such a bad move

[1:49:39] <rudybrossard> I think Garrus has like 2 or 3 convo in this game
[1:49:40] <tearsaurther> @patstaresat did you know Billie Eillish's mom is the voice of the blue chick that kills if you if you two have sex
[1:49:42] <+Daigrey> Elusive man first
[1:49:42] <%ironohki> Those calibrations are what make the guns so rad in the end sequence.
[1:49:43] <stantheman_97> calibrate this bussy
[1:49:44] <fullyradical> Shepherd does the virgin walk
[1:49:44] <%Cykron> He puts the mess in Mess Sergeant
[1:49:44] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat why do you think we end up affectionate towards these repeating voice lines? is it just the love of repeating things?
[1:49:44] <KeystoneA2> Sigma Shepard: Never look in the direction you're walking
[1:49:45] <James_Quivers> He's literally doing the virgin walk
[1:49:48] <%BarujaraciGaming> holden80CREW

[1:49:54] <derap41> @dreu81 also token
[1:49:54] <+MrAtheGreat> What happens if you stare at the ceiling while you run?
[1:49:55] <Samurai_Tchan> miranda wants to calibrate her pc
[1:49:56] <$lumporr> shepard should throw a pouty fit if nobody talks to him between missions
[1:49:56] <$Dungeon00X> Calibrations all day long
[1:49:56] <Seth_Tek> oh my god, Adum is in a hot tub guys!

[1:50:07] <Samurai_Tchan> already kasumi ?
[1:50:07] <SubliminaIMessages> Everyone’s like “f off Shepherd”
[1:50:08] <%RetroCop87> "Commander Shepard came to talk to me, but he was doing this weird thing with his neck, so I told him I was busy"
[1:50:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[1:50:09] <derap41> DLC Dialog is weak
[1:50:09] <Pookiedaexzile> I wish Kasumi had more dialgoue
[1:50:10] <%idyota> Kasumi's the best
[1:50:11] <%HairballCT> that's why shepard's running like that. "NO ONE WANTS TO TALK TO ME ON MY OWN SHIP BOO HOO HOO" LUL
[1:50:15] <%jillpilled> :( Kasumi no

[1:50:30] <$Dungeon00X> Kasumi has a special line if you talk to the Ramen guy
[1:50:30] <+Daigrey> You'll get nothing till you deal with the Elusive man.
[1:50:32] <fugly_nick> Yeah her and Zaeed get nothing
[1:50:32] <Zalapski> she has a lot more later
[1:50:33] <Samurai_Tchan> thane
[1:50:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Zaeed would have been better with more as well
[1:50:38] <Virokwet> her and kaheed are like that
[1:50:38] <%SataruYamate> kasumi has alot of in mission dialogue tho @PatStaresAt
[1:50:42] <%bread_assassin> Not until Javik where the DLC companions get meaty.

[1:51:05] <+MrAtheGreat> @PatStaresAt Is it better when Shepard is staring at the ground while running or when he's running with his head at a slight angle?
[1:51:08] <$lumporr> why were you killing krogan in the krogan DMZ?
[1:51:11] <%Ipsenscastle> Yeah Kasumi has lots of mission dialogue, less Normandy stuff
[1:51:13] <tranquilturnip> thanks Candy
[1:51:17] <rudybrossard> I remember how sad I was when I realised how small the team in ME3 was
[1:51:17] <derap41> yeah War crimes
[1:51:19] <someyounguy1> gosh zaeed is the worst
[1:51:20] <Pookiedaexzile> You gotta think they don't want them to say anything that will make the other characters not make sense
[1:51:23] <%BarujaraciGaming> @peachy996 AS SHE SHOULD BE lol
[1:51:24] <Pookiedaexzile> so they can't interact

[1:51:46] <peachy996> @BarujaraciGaming Yeah I know but if she was alive, her dialogue plays like a DLC in this. No real conversations
[1:51:46] <+KingdomGene> Cheer2000 Just wanted to say thanks for the content once again, my girlfriend and I started watching your RE2 remake and it’s been great, have fun defeating the reapers!
[1:51:47] <%king_wragles> Can you use the garbage compactor on Zaeed? It's purpose IS to compact garbage

[1:52:31] <falyden> Nice factoids
[1:52:35] <peachy996> "We're sexy though"
[1:52:40] <%Cykron> That's weird, quarians seem kinda soft
[1:52:40] <+MrAtheGreat> QUARIANS AINT SOFT BRO

[1:52:44] <peachy996> Good joke
[1:52:45] <Symmy_> Quarians have stronger bones than humans/turians/salarians

[1:52:47] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[1:52:47] <derap41> @lumporr Its Females that are infertile
[1:52:49] <fugly_nick> Grunt is baby
[1:52:54] <%weissguard> Grunt's fun. He likes to have fun
[1:53:00] <TioXyco> Grunt has a sharp humor
[1:53:01] <Samurai_Tchan> LEGION is not soft
[1:53:05] <Zalapski> Okeer imprinted him with puns?? that monster!
[1:53:05] <+Daigrey> Sigma Krogan
[1:53:08] <slix3431> Strong people die all the time
[1:53:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Empathy is a thing you must teach babies
[1:53:11] <rudybrossard> Like how old is he actually in Human years
[1:53:12] <+ryuguitarfreak> Grunt is a teen
[1:53:14] <derap41> man grunt is so busted
[1:53:19] <mcsassafras> turians apparently auto corrects to turbans my apologies
[1:53:19] <+TheBitingIrish> Grunt is a genetically engineered tube baby krogan
[1:53:20] <$lumporr> is it weird that grunt is like, a hot krogan? like he looks, krogan attractive?
[1:53:21] <%Cykron> He babby
[1:53:30] <BlackStarAura> Aww
[1:53:33] <dreu81> Grunt is surprisingly measured and considerate considering his origin. Should be the hero.
[1:53:37] <ioci2112> grunt is literally a baby, a big angry baby that was created to murder things
[1:53:38] <DSD24> Krogan has a unique design
[1:53:40] <Dunmarkh> If okeer is so smart how come he's fuckin dead?
[1:53:41] <DSD24> I mean Grunt
[1:53:42] <%Cykron> Well Grunt, now you can try to die
[1:53:48] <%BarujaraciGaming> WORF. THAT IS ENOUGH COSPLAY GET OUT OF THE FROG SUIT

[1:54:09] <%AzureGale> Also voiced by Steve Blum
[1:54:10] <%Cykron> Oh no not the Jack HOle
[1:54:11] <$Dungeon00X> Grunt is just Wrex Jr.

[1:59:53] <Dunmarkh> @BarujaraciGaming paige just got back from america
[1:59:56] <fugly_nick> Just imagine Shepard having to leave the conversation so he doesn't shit himself
[2:00:09] <peachy996> She MAYBE has a reason to be an edgy bitch? Just my 2 cents tho
[2:00:09] <derap41> @justnathan18 That's what I'm getting at she tries to hard and its cute that she does
[2:00:20] <%JamesCorck> Pat pooping again?

[2:01:05] <peachy996> You find more about Jack later on, for now at face value she's pretty love or hate
[2:01:05] <+Pomer> i didn't mean it negatively, y'know?

[2:01:42] <Samurai_Tchan> @ainzhelm there is no bathroom

[2:05:26] <jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt Anderson changes his dialog about Kaiden after Horizon, you only know if you ask him about kaiden again it doesn't rewrite his prompt to clue you in.
[2:05:28] <%bassoontyphoon> KISS KAIDAN PAT

[2:06:03] <%BarujaraciGaming> Joe Estevez deserved this role more than fuckin Martin Sheen
[2:06:08] <peachy996> Ash is where she stops being tolerable at best
[2:06:10] <%Arancet> paige reminds me of those video game characters that can only progress by falling apart and pulling themselves back together, like stubbs the zombie or jj macfield
[2:06:14] <DSD24> This mission is hard in Insanity
[2:06:15] <jackelzxaa> ashley was so bad in me2 that the writers made an email on the website and had her read it out and it was actually pretty decent and emotional
[2:06:23] <jackelzxaa> as her apologizing for horizon
[2:06:23] <%Garthunox> @BarujaraciGaming cool story bro
[2:06:25] <%Alazull> Oh he let Ashley die huh
[2:06:25] <Oxybe> Hydrate the Geif
[2:06:28] <+RobPiresLu> Zangief will be soon the bigger of the familly
[2:06:34] <peachy996> Ash is a massive turbo bitch and that's where her "I DON'T TRUST YOU CERBERUS MAN" writing starts
[2:06:41] <derap41> oh fuck off
[2:06:44] <%BarujaraciGaming> @garthunox it costs nothing to disagree and not be a shit about it
[2:06:49] <Virokwet> eff this guy
[2:06:54] <%Cykron> Almost like its a trap
[2:06:54] <hereiam407> @BarujaraciGaming  Lol, greatest actor of our generation
[2:06:59] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Where did Mordin get that Seeker Drone?
[2:07:02] <DSD24> He's got a cool suit though
[2:07:06] <%machshop> bug
[2:07:07] <DSD24> Ewww
[2:07:11] <LluthyY> its kinda cute lol
[2:07:14] <derap41> Martin Sheen is a pos
[2:07:14] <%Garthunox> @BarujaraciGaming it costs nothing to be a shit about it either
[2:07:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> B U G
[2:07:18] <peachy996> So killing Ash is like the best thing you can do for her really
[2:07:18] <%BarujaraciGaming> @hereiam407 I mean, the dudes in Decker!!!!
[2:07:22] <+pally_din> Yis
[2:07:23] <Daniel_Is_I> :)
[2:07:24] <SaltyAzteca> YES.
[2:07:24] <%machshop> :)
[2:07:24] <%Cykron> "I have something"
[2:07:26] <jorniev> FLYING SCORPIONS
[2:07:28] <Dunmarkh> :)
[2:07:29] <peachy996> SPACE BEE
[2:07:29] <Samurai_Tchan> EWW
[2:07:30] <+TopTieramisu> :)
[2:07:30] <%animaturgy> I love mordin
[2:07:31] <%idyota> that smile :)
[2:07:32] <BlackStarAura> Call me crazy but I thought Ashley was more apologetic post-Horizon than Kaidan was, but I romanced his doubting ass as FemShep
[2:07:35] <+Faultlined> Mordin is the best
[2:07:35] <murdocismyhero> I have ST's
[2:07:35] <+Pomer> Mordin is the best character in the series.
[2:07:37] <%justnathan18> I dont buy Ash as a Spectre because shes like 27 in ME2. Shep was the best human ever and he had to wait till he was like 29 AND he was an L3 with weird protheon shit going on
[2:07:37] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:07:38] <%ainzhelm> When the fuck did they get this?
[2:07:40] <+kawachipto> Mordin is the best
[2:07:40] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> Side missions?
[2:07:41] <Broken_Sonex> Y E S
[2:07:42] <peachy996> Look Paige, It's the Space Bees!

[2:07:44] <Dunmarkh> based zangief
[2:07:44] <+Pomer> TBH i'd play a spinoff
[2:07:45] <Chaos_Aether> 2
[2:07:46] <hereiam407> @BarujaraciGaming This game stole a lot of ideas from Decker, that one episode
[2:07:47] <Chaos_Aether> 3
[2:07:48] <DSD24> There he is
[2:07:48] <BlackStarAura> Even when I didn’t romance him, Kaidan was a whiny bitch baby IMO
[2:07:49] <derap41> Gief seems to have a feet thing
[2:07:51] <DSD24> The boi
[2:07:51] <srv4254> it sucks
[2:07:51] <Samurai_Tchan> WELL you asked him and he said yes
[2:07:52] <%idyota> gief is a foot fiend confirmed
[2:07:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @peachy996 we cured her racism Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:07:52] <%Cykron> IT'S HIM
[2:07:55] <Chaos_Aether> Bell Ring
[2:07:57] <$SGrim> Carth!

[2:08:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE BOI
[2:08:06] <derap41> yay the guy even more boring than Jacob
[2:08:06] <stantheman_97> when did you get a seeker?
[2:08:07] <ioci2112> yeah, prepare your ass because this is a huge difficulty spike, same with the collector ship
[2:08:08] <%AzureGale> Too bad Garrus isn;t there to do calibrations oh ho ho
[2:08:09] <Virokwet> i see Kaiden had upgraded to med armor
[2:08:11] <Dehlome> his gun is clipping
[2:08:11] <%idyota> Who calls their kid LILLITH?
[2:08:12] <%justnathan18> Look how handsome
[2:08:15] <jackelzxaa> Kaiden got promoted from leutennant to commander!
[2:08:15] <Samurai_Tchan> still using Mass Effect 1 armor kaiden ? you have no shame ?
[2:08:16] <%radda343> that lady's face is real scary

[2:09:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Everybody knows big dick bee
[2:09:06] <willsin4fun> Kaiden sounds like a guy who'd be like "I dont want to talk about it" constantly
[2:09:08] <stantheman_97> NOT THE BEES
[2:09:09] <BlackStarAura> Too bad that didn’t kill him

[2:09:14] <hereiam407> @trianglehat <3
[2:09:20] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Kasumi's loyalty power is actually one of the few that can stun Harbinger
[2:09:21] <%maenos2> DIRECT
[2:09:22] <%maenos2> CONTROL
[2:09:23] <+Punchasaur> actual nightmare scenario
[2:09:24] <%ElkRiverDog> PrideFloat PrideFloat PrideFloat PrideFloat PrideFloat
[2:09:25] <%BarujaraciGaming> SPACE POLIO STRIKES AGAIN
[2:09:26] <jorniev> SO YOU GET STUCK ON AN AKWARD POSE
[2:09:27] <peachy996> Tailor made to keep Paige away from 2 lol
[2:09:27] <ScreamLord> She gets melted on the Collector Base
[2:09:28] <%Cykron> NOT THE BEES
[2:09:30] <+TopTieramisu> they look dope
[2:09:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TOKI WO TAMARE
[2:09:31] <%justnathan18> ooey gooey collectors
[2:09:32] <jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt The population of Horizon is 643,315 people
[2:09:33] <DSD24> There he is!
[2:09:34] <$realm_forge> SPACE BEES
[2:09:34] <derap41> @ape_hawk I hate how accurate that is
[2:09:34] <jorniev> SO COOL
[2:09:34] <QuestlordJake> SAY THE LINE HARBINGER
[2:09:37] <SaltyAzteca> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[2:09:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Honestly it's pretty nuts that the reapers never used anything like these guys in 3.
[2:09:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:09:40] <Samurai_Tchan> THESE ARE THE PROTEANS
[2:09:41] <jorniev> COOLER THAN THE REAPERS
[2:09:42] <DSD24> Yes!
[2:09:42] <%justnathan18> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[2:09:44] <%Alazull> ASSUMING CONTROL
[2:09:44] <%maenos2> YAY HE SAID IT
[2:09:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> This seems hugely effective.
[2:09:44] <%Cykron> HE SAID THE THING
[2:09:45] <AngryAsian5> HE SAID THE THIGN!
[2:09:45] <ioci2112> what if the bees sting you when you are shitting, that would be so awkward
[2:09:45] <srv4254> YEEEEE
[2:09:46] <Broken_Sonex> C O N T R O L
[2:09:48] <jorniev> yeaaaah
[2:09:49] <SaltyAzteca> HE SAID THE LIIIIIIIIIIINE
[2:09:50] <peachy996> There's the line
[2:09:50] <feralspidey> "Bees. My God." - Batman
[2:09:51] <Pookiedaexzile> You mean bug monsters with emotionless faces
[2:09:53] <%jillpilled> THE THING
[2:09:54] <Goraka91> PogChamp
[2:09:54] <hereiam407> There's compilation videos of this guys voice, 11 minutes of assuming control
[2:09:55] <stantheman_97> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[2:09:55] <+Qexec> I clapped when he said it.
[2:09:57] <Samurai_Tchan> crab looking
[2:09:58] <cucumbercult> bees always with the bees
[2:10:01] <+Ghufufin> this is what happens when you get the Bad End in Farscape and Pilot goes EVVVIL
[2:10:01] <%Cykron> BURNING
[2:10:02] <%BarujaraciGaming> I can't tell, is this guy assuming control?
[2:10:02] <BlackStarAura> Traynor’s family was on Horizon when this happened
[2:10:03] <dero45> misuFeels
[2:10:05] <peachy996> Harbinger is a dork
[2:10:10] <ioci2112> this hurts you
[2:10:11] <jackelzxaa> you think horizon is like 2 blocks but it's actually a very large city that the game represents POORLY.
[2:10:12] <%maenos2> @Samurai_Tchan more cicada i'd say
[2:10:18] <+LvckyLvc> that thigh gap, damn
[2:10:18] <fullyradical> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[2:10:18] <Goraka91> Keith Szarabaka my man
[2:10:19] <%Ravioli_Ronin> These guys slap in ME3 myltiplayer
[2:10:20] <MildMannered_Creighton> giant enemy crab?
[2:10:25] <Oxybe> SPAAAAACE BEEEEEES
[2:10:26] <%ainzhelm> Do they ever explain why he’s on fire?
[2:10:27] <dero45> harvest
[2:10:27] <Symmy_> Wait isnt this a hivemind who is he talking to?
[2:10:29] <%Cykron> Oh boy ascention that sounds good
[2:10:29] <QuestlordJake> the praetorian oh god oh fuck
[2:10:30] <%cowfootdude> @Ghufufin omg It does look a lot like Pilot from Farscape
[2:10:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> his lines are sick
[2:10:37] <+D00msDayDan> god they're so mocapped
[2:10:37] <%The_Review_Corps> ASSUMING CONTROL OF MY DICK
[2:10:40] <%idyota> best grill
[2:10:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Models cost money pat
[2:10:43] <DSD24> Wow these skills
[2:10:44] <%justnathan18> Holy shit hes bringing a human
[2:10:46] <TheIronBrass> God Harbinger is so cool
[2:10:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Crowd shots are expensive
[2:10:49] <%Cykron> Blocking out the haters
[2:10:49] <peachy996> These guys are a tough fight in multiplayer
[2:10:53] <notsoy> sci-fi games have always been terrible at properly displaying scale
[2:10:58] <TourettesPlays> get dat recharge pat
[2:11:06] <%maenos2> wait horizon has a populatino of HOW MANY?
[2:11:10] <%maenos2> *population
[2:11:10] <$SGrim> He has a system
[2:11:11] <%ape_hawk> wait, jacks a vanguard? i thought she was an adept?
[2:11:11] <jackelzxaa> jack's dlc outfit is such an improvement
[2:11:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> 700 thousand.
[2:11:19] <%Arancet> yes but what about next mission? you wont get a new one here
[2:11:19] <hereiam407> 700k
[2:11:21] <%maenos2> i thought it was some fucking little podunk thing
[2:11:24] <Samurai_Tchan> flotila
[2:11:24] <%AzureGale> You have this planned out, huh
[2:11:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Powers
[2:11:26] <Chaos_Aether> I still remember the Mass effect movie about the collectors and wow it was messed
[2:11:26] <derap41> Hah weapons for a biotic LUL
[2:11:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ape_hawk Samara is your adept.
[2:11:29] <%Ravioli_Ronin> All you have do do is show a huge city and then just close in on Kaiden and a few people for that scene
[2:11:29] <%SataruYamate> also, like 50/60% of ME 2 party cast is human
[2:11:30] <jackelzxaa> nah jack uses a shotgun
[2:11:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Dude there is such a thing as too many tattoos
[2:11:32] <SaltyAzteca> Miranda Kappa
[2:11:33] <jackelzxaa> shes vanguard every day
[2:11:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> Or the closest thing to it.
[2:11:40] <fugly_nick> Bring Garrus to every single mission
[2:11:56] <%idyota> SHES WORF
[2:11:58] <%bassoontyphoon> I like Kasumi
[2:12:01] <%NopeBadguy> Samara as well
[2:12:02] <Virokwet> LUL fair
[2:12:04] <%ape_hawk> yeah, its really dumb
[2:12:05] <jackelzxaa> lol
[2:12:06] <Broken_Sonex> The best example of the 2010's edge
[2:12:07] <derap41> yeah she ain
[2:12:09] <thetunnelhomer> Yea, Jack gets shafted in more ways than one.
[2:12:10] <dero45> solos 3 mechs lol
[2:12:10] <TourettesPlays> WAit til you get Squad Warp Ammo Pat
[2:12:10] <%The_Review_Corps> cutscene power
[2:12:11] <%dekkitout> Like a castmemeber in Jojos
[2:12:12] <%machshop> she's not LOYAL yet pat
[2:12:14] <hereiam407> She's holding back until you prove yourself
[2:12:15] <BlockingDisabled> Warp Ammo all day erry day
[2:12:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yup for sure.
[2:12:16] <Pookiedaexzile> The Mandela Effect, People remember her worse than she is
[2:12:16] <+Pomer> Vanguard best class
[2:12:19] <%Cykron> Haha she's kinda pathetic in actual gameplay
[2:12:19] <jackelzxaa> jack not being able to biotic charge is fucking missed opportunity
[2:12:19] <+polothegreatest> is was the adrenaline, pat
[2:12:19] <Profmcstevie> Boss character vs in your party
[2:12:20] <%AzureGale> Even Gief is unimpressed
[2:12:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> Thane is also like that though.
[2:12:22] <derap41> she ain't tearing down any sentries any time soon
[2:12:25] <BlackStarAura> If you have Garrus with you on Horizon during Kaidan’s bitch fit, you can FEEL the judgement
[2:12:25] <Samurai_Tchan> BUT that was agains dumb asses
[2:12:27] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt At least she has Shockwave and Warp Ammo
[2:12:28] <%ainzhelm> Lol
[2:12:29] <jackelzxaa> imagine if she was just zipping around like an asshole blasting people
[2:12:30] <stantheman_97> one man army to generic vanguard
[2:12:31] <TourettesPlays> Pat have you use Pull even once???
[2:12:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> Thane in cutscene is basically untouchable and can disappear at whim.
[2:12:34] <AmuserName> she's REALLY weak on Insanity, without any barrier stripping powers.
[2:12:38] <ioci2112> jack is probably one of the weakest squadmates gameplay wise, which makes no sense but whatever
[2:12:41] <%BarujaraciGaming> THE MORE YOU FUCK HER THE STRONGER SHE BECUMS
[2:12:44] <%radda343> he bork
[2:12:46] <%Cykron> She was balanced into mediocrity
[2:12:46] <Pookiedaexzile> People have created whole memories of her doing shit that never happens
[2:12:48] <peachy996> You could bs it as an adrenaline boost from getting woken up
[2:12:49] <notsoy> carnifex LOL
[2:12:53] <derap41> @Cykron Very much a glass cannon
[2:12:56] <+ColonelHandzLanza> Biotics are absurd outside of gameplay but for balance they bring em down
[2:12:57] <Chaos_Aether> oh he hungy
[2:12:57] <ScreamLord> She goes from single handedly eviscerating a massive prison barge to barely being able to handle a group of husks
[2:12:58] <jackelzxaa> shockwave can be fine if you line her up
[2:12:59] <%AzureGale> I see
[2:12:59] <Too_Much_Nukie> @AmuserName She's actually great against collectors in insanity with warp ammo.
[2:12:59] <%Arancet> why the change?
[2:13:00] <%JobbedBone> D:
[2:13:01] <%idyota> is she going to break her back after an empty plastic barrel falls on her
[2:13:02] <LluthyY> Feed me Father!
[2:13:03] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL doodLUL doodLUL
[2:13:04] <Samurai_Tchan> the adrenaline increased her powah
[2:13:05] <+tempestzephyr> that's like you know a party member is temporary, so you take all his clothes and gear before they leave
[2:13:06] <%ExpressNode> Why's that?
[2:13:07] <hereiam407> bork
[2:13:08] <%machshop> HANGRY
[2:13:08] <%ainzhelm> Garrus is like Batman. With enough time and planning he can kill an army
[2:13:08] <%The_Review_Corps> hell get used to it by next week
[2:13:09] <jackelzxaa> biotics have a partial effect on shielded and armored enemies at least
[2:13:15] <%bassoontyphoon> Plz father feed me
[2:13:15] <TurtlesAndTentacles> ARF
[2:13:20] <derap41> Cause he fucking fat
[2:13:21] <%walternatorz> wait, he hasn't eaten? he must think the world is ending
[2:13:24] <jackelzxaa> so it's still useful on hardcore, but insanity has too much shields to really be balanced
[2:13:25] <peachy996> At least this hitbox stayed the same
[2:13:27] <%VashyronM> "feed me, I'm dying"
[2:13:31] <fugly_nick> GRUNT
[2:13:33] <%AzureGale> GRUNT GRUNT GRUNT GRUNT GRUNT
[2:13:35] <%dekkitout> Team Violence
[2:13:37] <+Ploobie> Why would you ever take Jack on a mission
[2:13:39] <karl_rex> Uncle Shep looks so old
[2:13:40] <Samurai_Tchan> THEIR SHIP IS A MOUNTAIN
[2:13:41] <jackelzxaa> grunt and jack would get along
[2:13:46] <TourettesPlays> God this is just the BEST looking Skybox in the entire series look at that shit
[2:13:47] <Pookiedaexzile> My perfered team before the next people you pick up
[2:13:47] <SaltyAzteca> Thanks Mordin
[2:13:50] <Chaos_Aether> great
[2:13:51] <derap41> I love Mordin
[2:13:53] <%StormBuster24> Thanks Mordin
[2:13:53] <Chaos_Aether> just great
[2:13:54] <jackelzxaa> jack could probably drink krogan alcohol and be ok
[2:13:55] <AngryAsian5> Fuck it! We'll do it live!
[2:13:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> Insanity is just generally bad in Mass Effect.
[2:13:56] <+Cactuskris> a hive
[2:13:58] <radioamnesiac> he's starving! he's never had food before in his whole life!!
[2:14:00] <%BarujaraciGaming> @ploobie free angsty ass
[2:14:02] <hereiam407> It's like a bee hive
[2:14:10] <DSD24> Insanity is pretty fun
[2:14:11] <+D00msDayDan> looks like they hollowed out an asteroid and added thrusters
[2:14:14] <jorniev> FUCKING WASP SHIP
[2:14:15] <%machshop> it reminds me of the dry ice ship in LotGH
[2:14:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> Draw fanart of Shepard giving Grunt a piggyback ride into battle.
[2:14:22] <BlackStarAura> I love Insanity
[2:14:25] <jackelzxaa> jack gets warp ammo from her loyalty
[2:14:27] <+Ploobie> If I wanted angsty ass, I would play that dumbass life is strange game.
[2:14:33] <jackelzxaa> its really weird jack got pull and not throw
[2:14:38] <thetunnelhomer> Might wanna give jack a pistol. She squish
[2:14:39] <+unhuggable1> ME2 insanity is the hardest because you are constantly running out of ammo
[2:14:42] <Samurai_Tchan> I SEE
[2:14:42] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you see the Smash player that ragequit after getting double Pot Bustered?
[2:14:42] <hereiam407> @Too_Much_Nukie Shepard would be split in two
[2:14:49] <SaltyAzteca> SHE SCARED
[2:14:50] <Samurai_Tchan> i see a little sillhuet of a man
[2:14:51] <DSD24> Looks like she's dead
[2:14:51] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[2:14:52] <%dekkitout> Lookin good, Jack
[2:14:52] <%idyota> she's thinking
[2:14:52] <$dalmek> this grass is menaing
[2:14:53] <%machshop> she just thinkin
[2:14:55] <Dunmarkh> oh no the seeker sgot her
[2:14:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:14:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> @jackelzxaa Really? She already has shockwave for damage though.
[2:14:55] <hereiam407> Focus
[2:14:56] <SilasDrekken> the bees got her monkaS
[2:14:56] <Pookiedaexzile> The grass is speaking to her
[2:14:56] <$dalmek> menacing, dammit
[2:14:57] <%AzureGale> Jack saw a Collector in the grass
[2:14:57] <derap41> @jackelzxaa Warp ammo is almost as busted as distuptor ammo
[2:14:57] <+pally_din> she's living on the edge
[2:14:58] <+Target616> I think the shotguns a bit heavy for her
[2:14:59] <Zebroneath> she is focused
[2:14:59] <ianabstract> She got stung
[2:14:59] <peachy996> Jack's Biotics are thought out well by Bioware
[2:15:00] <dero45> just a lil ptsd
[2:15:01] <ScreamLord> Jack's Warp Ammo is actually really good. It's like Cryo and Incendiary combined
[2:15:01] <%dekkitout> I think the bugs got her
[2:15:02] <%MugenSandan> ULTIMATE STEALTH
[2:15:02] <Pookiedaexzile> SHe on that good drug
[2:15:02] <%Cykron> She can't handle the pressure
[2:15:03] <stantheman_97> THE SEEKERS GOT HER
[2:15:05] <peachy996> Whoops I meant aren't
[2:15:05] <ianabstract> collector swarm got her
[2:15:08] <+D00msDayDan> she doesn't really need throw if she has shockwave
[2:15:09] <LluthyY> that grass is being kinda suspicious...
[2:15:09] <%jillpilled> There's a seeker bee in the grass
[2:15:13] <+JaseAdrift> That grass is taunting her
[2:15:21] <%BarujaraciGaming> @ploobie so you're going from incredible angsty ass to just trash garbage? ok
[2:15:22] <%Cykron> Horizon looks just like Eden Prime
[2:15:22] <derap41> To edgy to mve
[2:15:26] <%justnathan18> Jacks not broken, shes damaged
[2:15:28] <Too_Much_Nukie> Jack SHOULD have Pull and Nova. But Nova only exists in 3.
[2:15:30] <fugly_nick> This gamers pacing is so weird
[2:15:30] <Pookiedaexzile> That grass is Cerberus
[2:15:32] <%idyota> dont forget the derelict reaper
[2:15:35] <peachy996> And the Derelict Ship
[2:15:35] <jackelzxaa> i usually do some of the dlc early
[2:15:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> Or even Charge and Nova.
[2:15:37] <%The_Review_Corps> beetle borgs
[2:15:37] <DSD24> EDF time
[2:15:38] <%bread_assassin> Forgetting the ship, too.
[2:15:38] <Daniel_Is_I> BEEEEEES
[2:15:40] <%AzureGale> NO NOT BUGS BUNNY
[2:15:40] <%Cykron> Ded
[2:15:43] <%maenos2> there's the "inactive" collector ship too
[2:15:47] <dero45> shotgun
[2:15:48] <%Garthunox> AND the collector ship
[2:15:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no it was Wasp
[2:15:50] <%machshop> it was guns the whole time
[2:15:52] <Pookiedaexzile> All along
[2:15:53] <QuestlordJake> the only good bug is a dead bug
[2:15:53] <derap41> Buckshot kills the bugs who kenw
[2:15:55] <%Cykron> USE THE WASP SPRAY
[2:15:56] <%Alazull> Shotgun round to face is an effective strategy
[2:15:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> AND do the Collector Ship
[2:15:57] <$Futurecity10> on insanity all these fuckers have armour and barriers
[2:16:02] <Archer336> We can also try hitting them with bug spray
[2:16:04] <%AzureGale> Bullets: the best insect repellent
[2:16:07] <jackelzxaa> i always do lair of the shadow broker early because of the dialog changes and the hub thing you unlock from it being so fucking useful
[2:16:08] <hereiam407> yep
[2:16:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> On hardcore they all just have barriers.
[2:16:13] <+Pomer> wow thgis gameplay seemed so much cooler in the 2010s,,,,, still a classic tho
[2:16:13] <%Cykron> COMBO
[2:16:15] <jackelzxaa> vanguard is so cool
[2:16:15] <QuestlordJake> yuh
[2:16:17] <+Ploobie> Why is Pat playing as Ron Howard?
[2:16:21] <DSD24> Mid Air charge lets go
[2:16:23] <jackelzxaa> the hybrid classes in me2 are all fucking cool
[2:16:28] <%The_Review_Corps> cant wait until pat experiences marauder sheilds
[2:16:29] <Pookiedaexzile> This team fucks collectors, but is shit againist tech
[2:16:32] <Chaos_Aether> do you get a Collector Gun in this game or am I thinking of the ME3 Multiplayer?
[2:16:36] <peachy996> That's weird to see not EXPLODE after ME3 and MEA
[2:16:36] <Profmcstevie> cheat sheeeet~
[2:16:37] <ioci2112> I would like to imagine if you choose the control ending in me3 the shepard intelligence just thinks every problem between synthetics and organics can be solved by shooting things from behind cover
[2:16:39] <fugly_nick> Vanguard Charge is really fun in Andromeda
[2:16:40] <jackelzxaa> adept and engineer kinda get nothing in me2, but soldier and the hybrids all have good shit
[2:16:42] <BlackStarAura> @ploobie Lmao
[2:16:42] <derap41> Honestly the collectors being such a menace in this advanced society is dumb
[2:16:45] <%sandrews> give jack to the collectors maybe you'll get a collector party member.
[2:16:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Honestly I like most of the classes in 2 and 3. Some are pretty lame in 1.
[2:16:45] <SpaceGuntank> a guide, really? LUL
[2:16:46] <%bread_assassin> Before I replayed ME2, I totally combined the Collector Ship and Derelict Reaper into one mission in my head.
[2:16:49] <+unhuggable1> jesus insanity is so much harder than this
[2:16:51] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you see the Smash player that ragequit after getting double Pot Bustered?
[2:16:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Chaos_Aether You get the laser here in this mission.
[2:16:56] <DSD24> @Chaos_Aether Nah you get that Collecter gun in this mission
[2:17:02] <peachy996> Oh. This is what we're doing huh? That's fair I guess
[2:17:02] <Chaos_Aether> got
[2:17:08] <Sol_Install> OH SICK
[2:17:09] <%YabbaTroll> @Chaos_Aether I know for sure there is a collector gun in me3 multiplayer, it gets infinite ammo if i remember right
[2:17:10] <%QueequegTheater> He was playing Milia, just jump
[2:17:14] <%BarujaraciGaming> @chaos_aether you get it in this game. dlc gives you the collector assault rifle at the start of the game
[2:17:14] <%Shubreaker> who?
[2:17:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Did he piss himself and cum
[2:17:15] <thetunnelhomer> All he had to do was jump
[2:17:19] <Sol_Install> That's fucking awesome to know
[2:17:20] <peachy996> Gotta do what you gotta do for those upgrades
[2:17:22] <thetunnelhomer> Just push some buttons
[2:17:25] <jackelzxaa> main missions there are...3 between the intro and endgame
[2:17:28] <%ainzhelm> @patstaresat Will you get the sniper rifle or the assault rifle on the collector ship?
[2:17:31] <%tank7013> That one guy desperately defending him in the replies was ru he funniest part
[2:17:31] <Profmcstevie> why did they simply not wavedash away from his salt
[2:17:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Or did he just hate GG's "guessieS" too much
[2:17:33] <SaltyAzteca> @QueequegTheater Did Pot just walk up slowly and buster him Kappa
[2:17:34] <+Cactuskris> did you see that u can air throw heavenly pot buster
[2:17:42] <%idyota> HACKERMAN
[2:17:44] <hereiam407> what do the colors mean mason
[2:17:52] <knight_verse> Currently playing through the Shadow Broker dlc and there's a hotel called Azure, which is apparently the asari word version of Blussy.
[2:18:03] <%QueequegTheater> @SaltyAzteca hid in the corner as Millia while the Pot hit him with Earthquake into Pot Buster
[2:18:06] <jackelzxaa> i like to end on suicide mission so i always do the dlc along the way.  plus i prefer the changes they make to a few cutscenes for playing them before you kill the collectors, it makes them feel more involved.
[2:18:12] <%QueequegTheater> The most braindead mixup
[2:18:18] <%justnathan18> @knight_verse Blussy confrimed blue
[2:18:18] <%RetroCop87> is this the same colony from the start of ME1?
[2:18:22] <thetunnelhomer> @knight_verse That's...accurate actually.
[2:18:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> @knight_verse That is correct.
[2:18:31] <%Cykron> It's hip to fuck BEES
[2:18:31] <DSD24> Come on Harbinger
[2:18:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> @RetroCop87 No that was Eden Prime.
[2:18:35] <SaltyAzteca> @QueequegTheater Thats even worse LUL
[2:18:39] <+Pomer> I wonder what asari look like to other asari
[2:18:39] <peachy996> Collector Assassin is a strange phrase
[2:18:46] <%ainzhelm> @retrocop87 nope
[2:18:46] <derap41> @RetroCop87 same planet
[2:18:47] <fugly_nick> @RetroCop87 No that's Eden Prime
[2:18:51] <Goraka91> No electric aoe FeelsBadMan
[2:18:54] <hereiam407> Is this the black ops to mass effects 1s COD?
[2:18:57] <jackelzxaa> any biotics will instakill husks because they can't land from a fall and not die
[2:18:58] <Symmy_> 2 made husks so easy, like 10% damage on legs instakills them
[2:18:59] <Corgifist> Oh god, Horizon, I remember this place being hell the first time I played it
[2:19:04] <peachy996> Oh right LOL Jack says old ME1 lines
[2:19:05] <%ainzhelm> @derap41 still nope
[2:19:06] <%justnathan18> ILL DESTROY YOU
[2:19:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Did he just Reppuken?
[2:19:11] <Profmcstevie> Commander Pat and his pair of murder loving idiots
[2:19:11] <peachy996> "I WILL DESTROY YOU"
[2:19:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Pomer They always look like Asari they're not mind controlling people to change their appearance. That's a misunderstanding of a scene gone viral.
[2:19:21] <jackelzxaa> jack says all of the me1 human quips
[2:19:23] <LluthyY> Praetorians were a nightmare my first time playing lol
[2:19:27] <ioci2112> @Symmy_ they also die instantly if they leave the ground, so shockwave is super effective against them
[2:19:28] <Corgifist> @Pomer That conversation is just that all non-asari races find different parts of Asari's attractive
[2:19:28] <jackelzxaa> it's weird hearing grunt talk about the mission
[2:19:32] <derap41> @ainzhelm Must be crazy
[2:19:33] <%afronooch> i miss ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[2:19:37] <%ainzhelm> @jackelzxaa it’s great
[2:19:42] <jackelzxaa> grunt saying things that aren't "kill death to kill"
[2:19:46] <peachy996> It is pretty similar to Eden Prime
[2:19:50] <Goraka91> @Pomer Also drunk talk in a bar is not hard canon LUL
[2:19:53] <Pookiedaexzile> That's Krogan Racism
[2:19:53] <FennecZephyr> I never really used Grunt
[2:19:54] <%idyota> LUL
[2:19:55] <derap41> @afronooch I'll tear you apart
[2:19:57] <+Pomer> @Corgifist @Too_Much_Nukie oh! thanks.
[2:20:00] <Broken_Sonex> He sounds too intelligent.
[2:20:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> I think that's intentional.
[2:20:02] <peachy996> The touchdown of the evil ship is similar to Eden Prime and Sovereign
[2:20:03] <%DracosMagala> Love taking Kasumi and Garrus on Horizon
[2:20:05] <FennecZephyr> I always liked Garrus more
[2:20:09] <+Pomer> @Goraka91 a very fair point
[2:20:11] <Symmy_> @ioci2112 yeah shame, they were actually dangerous in 1
[2:20:13] <%StoopKid241> I've never taken this team combo for this mission, so this is fun to see.
[2:20:13] <FennecZephyr> I need snipers on my team
[2:20:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Krogans are confirmed for having science
[2:20:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> IT IS FORBIDDEN
[2:20:21] <DSD24> Yeah it was disco
[2:20:28] <Vantesla> Its been a while. Isn't Grunts Claymore pretty bad for him?
[2:20:29] <%The_Review_Corps> i remember loving me3's skyboxes
[2:20:30] <Pookiedaexzile> and making nuclear weapons
[2:20:30] <scarman125> this is the remastered version of Mass Effect 2? man I remember this game looking better than this.
[2:20:35] <fugly_nick> The hell is that armor pattern
[2:20:46] <dero45> why he ask jack lol
[2:20:47] <jackelzxaa> theres a mod for base me2 that lets you recruit thane, samara, and tali before horizon.  theres unused dialog all over, except if you take thane or samara to horizon the mission kinda breaks.  tali's fine though.
[2:20:51] <%Cykron> TELL ME JACK
[2:20:51] <+tempestzephyr> the lip synching LUL
[2:20:56] <%Shubreaker> "almost worse"
[2:20:56] <%Cykron> I NEED ANSWERS
[2:20:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Vantesla Ehhhh it's debatable. Optimal is an assault shotgun but if you want the stopping power claymore is best.
[2:21:00] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Because they assume you bring Miranda
[2:21:01] <ianabstract> bringing the two living guinea pigs with you is kinda messed up
[2:21:01] <LluthyY> Tell him Jack!
[2:21:03] <ARDM112> Cerberus gave you superpowers Jack, and the Collectors are turning these people into goo
[2:21:07] <+TopTieramisu> words of wisdom
[2:21:10] <%dekkitout> That's right, Grunt
[2:21:13] <+chester804> probably supposed to bring Mordin with you so Shepard asks that question to him
[2:21:15] <%Monkeyweed21> THEY DONT RUN IN CIRCLES
[2:21:16] <%QueequegTheater> Makes sense
[2:21:16] <%Cykron> To be fair you've chosen the worst choices for an analysis
[2:21:17] <NeroInfinite> yeah
[2:21:18] <%idyota> pretty muchg
[2:21:19] <peachy996> Yeah kinda
[2:21:19] <jackelzxaa> i usually use garrus and jacob on this mission
[2:21:22] <QuestlordJake> shoot make kill
[2:21:22] <Corgifist> I always assumed Mordin was the assumed pick
[2:21:23] <DSD24> Miranda has Overload and Warp
[2:21:26] <derap41> @chester804 Grunt gets a gold star
[2:21:27] <feralspidey> Cause Jack is psychic
[2:21:31] <Sunstalker> i bring Mordin?
[2:21:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> @jackelzxaa In the earlier builds of the game Legion was your first squadmate.
[2:21:32] <%barrakuta371> I feel like Motrin would make more sense
[2:21:35] <%jillpilled> Who would ever bring Miranda lmao
[2:21:37] <%ainzhelm> They actually totally are getting away with more victims shepherd
[2:21:38] <SaltyAzteca> Your smile, optimism and your people. Gone.
[2:21:39] <%BarujaraciGaming> why would you ever bring Miranda on ANYTHING but loyalty for that ass lol
[2:21:44] <%Cykron> The combined brain power of Jack and Grunt must be staggering
[2:21:46] <jackelzxaa> i always bring miranda and jack on eachother's missions because they have unique bickering cutscenes
[2:21:54] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt By the way I want defend my tanking thing from yesterday, WHM is doing like 4 million damage on Blood Lilies now
[2:21:58] <peachy996> Mordin has a unique line about testing the anti seeker swarm tech first hand
[2:22:01] <ARDM112> Miranda is mechanically the best squadmate
[2:22:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Mirandas ass is fake, and her voice is annoying
[2:22:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Miranda gives a passive buff to the whole squad because they assumed you'd bring her often.
[2:22:07] <%QueequegTheater> I am not the only tank losing aggro
[2:22:08] <Corgifist> Yeah, that's why it's the best shotgun
[2:22:08] <+D00msDayDan> I WILL DESTROY YOU
[2:22:14] <Samurai_Tchan> pat doesnt have the collector armor ?
[2:22:15] <jackelzxaa> @Too_Much_Nukie yeah that's why the original me2 teaser shows legion scanning the status of shepard's crew and it says "Shepard: diseased!"
[2:22:16] <%ainzhelm> @barujaracigaming You can bring her to jacks stuff for more arguing
[2:22:20] <Corgifist> Claymore does way more damage but holy fuck is the reload a pain
[2:22:23] <%Cykron> ENEMY IS EVERYWHERE
[2:22:25] <NeroInfinite> "why doI hear more"
[2:22:27] <SaltyAzteca> COOL IT
[2:22:28] <jackelzxaa> you were gonna play as legion looking for shepard's body in a snowy environment
[2:22:28] <fugly_nick> I see you stopped using that Geth shotgun
[2:22:34] <DSD24> Its cool
[2:22:35] <%QueequegTheater> Ice power is fucking busted
[2:22:39] <%machshop> ????
[2:22:41] <+Buzzkill983> Enemy is Everywhere!
[2:22:41] <%Cykron> She totally walked into it lol
[2:22:42] <%idyota> STOP SHOOTING JACK
[2:22:45] <%apostateCourier> Miranda has a shield popping power and an armor popping power; she's designed to be super useful mechanically so you'll bring her all the time.  Too bad about... everything else.
[2:22:45] <derap41> Cryo and Warp is busted
[2:22:46] <Samurai_Tchan> @D00msDayDan haha
[2:22:46] <jackelzxaa> jack is spicy and she hates the human supremacists
[2:22:47] <Broken_Sonex> @BarujaraciGaming She's one the most useful party members due to her being about to use Overload and Warp
[2:22:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> @jackelzxaa Yeah for the first level you wouldn't been playing as him.
[2:22:48] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Frozen enemies take double damage and have a chance to instantly die
[2:22:48] <DSD24> Hehehe

[2:23:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cryo ammo isn't good in this game except for specific situations.
[2:23:19] <%RetroCop87> ohohohoho
[2:23:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Cryo ammo is much better in 3.
[2:23:20] <jackelzxaa> remember when Jack was supposed to be bisexual but the fox news shit caused bioware to pull her lesbian romance from the game?
[2:23:20] <derap41> Pat chill you'll blow your asshole out again
[2:23:22] <%logoth_> that's cold, calling him an asshole
[2:23:22] <%Cykron> Let's be chill for once
[2:23:23] <hereiam407> Ice to see you
[2:23:23] <Vantesla> Claymore for shep, but ill recall GruntsClaymore does around 40% less damage vs shep. Also bad fire rate as AI wont do command cancel
[2:23:24] <Samurai_Tchan> @idyota IF SHE DIES....SHE DIES
[2:23:26] <stantheman_97> ice powers are pretty cool
[2:23:27] <%RaziWraith> Those powers would be really good against dinosaurs. KappaHD
[2:23:27] <%DracosMagala> Chill mang LUL
[2:23:28] <peachy996> Alright we'll put the puns on ice
[2:23:28] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This is literally a Claptrap joke in Borderlands 2
[2:23:31] <%dekkitout> Ice can't see what the big deal is
[2:23:32] <+D00msDayDan> pat you gotta chill
[2:23:33] <%ainzhelm> @barujaracigaming Whatever works for you. Some people enjoy conflict and asshole characters
[2:23:34] <feralspidey> Chats gonna pull a Mr Freeze pun war
[2:23:34] <+OneGorillionDollars> Pat needs to take a chill pill
[2:23:36] <%Cykron> WHAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS?
[2:23:37] <%BarujaraciGaming> psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat psaPat
[2:23:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Allow Me to break the ice

[2:23:42] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile You saying Australians sound annoying?
[2:23:44] <%afronooch> yep
[2:23:49] <stealthfart> Stay cool Pat
[2:23:49] <%embranz> Ice powers are fucking stupid. All bark, no FROSTbite.
[2:23:52] <Corgifist> The Ice rounds are decent, but Armor-piercing rounds, Garrus' loyalty power is fucking so GOOD
[2:23:55] <%ape_hawk> yeah...
[2:23:55] <Dunmarkh> REFRIGERATOR
[2:23:56] <Goraka91> Hm
[2:24:03] <derap41> People only care about how it ends
[2:24:03] <@commanderclaw> It's why people liked ME3's multiplayer, it's just pure gameplay
[2:24:04] <Pookiedaexzile> @Broken_Sonex She's from New Zealand
[2:24:05] <Samurai_Tchan> @Cykron THE ENEMIES EVERYWHERE !
[2:24:06] <Pookiedaexzile> wow bro
[2:24:06] <%Cykron> Let's kick some ICE
[2:24:07] <IntrepidEye> Then wow Andromeda sucks at everything
[2:24:07] <%weissguard> Stay Frosty, Pat.
[2:24:07] <%maskedsongbird> OH GOD THE PUNS
[2:24:07] <peachy996> And then by Andromeda "Wow."
[2:24:09] <+unhuggable1> dont ask
[2:24:09] <+TopTieramisu> the games shifted their stats
[2:24:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah gameplay gets better with each game. Story gets worse.
[2:24:10] <Badgerconda_> to be fair, 3 is better than 2 all around, except the ending is hot garbage.
[2:24:11] <%idyota> do you think they're gonna pick a canon ending?
[2:24:12] <+Arkanitus> with ice like that combat will be a breeze
[2:24:12] <%AncelDeLambert> FREEZE IN HELL, BATMAN!
[2:24:15] <DSD24> Stay cool birdboy
[2:24:15] <%bread_assassin> ME3 is way more of an RPG than ME2, though?
[2:24:17] <%maenos2> haha
[2:24:17] <+ScrapKingKeita> DEEP FREEZER
[2:24:18] <%BarujaraciGaming> @ainzhelm yeah I get it, it's really cool that this series can be for everyone in that way. one of the huge reasons I love it! brings a lot of random types of people together
[2:24:18] <%king_wragles> Cause they're humans?
[2:24:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> because its cool
[2:24:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Cause its all Chill bro
[2:24:21] <%Mattais88> ME3 is a great cation game for 95%
[2:24:21] <Archmortal> wow what good multiplayer that we can't play anymore
[2:24:22] <%king_wragles> Humans live here?
[2:24:24] <%QueequegTheater> Congratulations chat, you're re-enacting Claptrap dialogue from BL2
[2:24:25] <hereiam407> Cool it bird boy
[2:24:26] <%OldOnyx> puns like that make me frigid
[2:24:26] <+Re_Volta> honestly the more i watch you play these the less i like any of them lol

[2:24:27] <%NateyBeak> COLD
[2:24:27] <%Cykron> STAY COOL BIRDBOY
[2:24:30] <thetunnelhomer> There is more wrong with ME3 than just the ending.
[2:24:34] <spuginky> what killed the dinosaurs?
[2:24:34] <+Cactuskris> Andromeda has the best combat
[2:24:35] <Samurai_Tchan> @AncelDeLambert HAHHSHSHS
[2:24:36] <Corgifist> @idyota it's gonna be Destroy, 100%
[2:24:37] <%ainzhelm> Andromeda is the bestest on paper and the worstest in execution on everything
[2:24:37] <derap41> @AncelDeLambert WHAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS !?
[2:24:37] <%The_Review_Corps> andromeda is fun when you mod it to shit
[2:24:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> Why wouldn't they Pat?
[2:24:40] <%QueequegTheater> It's not good
[2:24:40] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile I'm from New Zealand @Pookiedaexzile
[2:24:44] <SaltyAzteca> Theyre frozen in time?
[2:24:44] <Samurai_Tchan> you lie

[2:24:44] <AthenaAegis> "CHILL OUT!" *In Arnold voice* Kappa
[2:24:48] <%afronooch> 3 is more action adventure with rpg elements tbh
[2:24:49] <hereiam407> The ICE AGE
[2:24:49] <The_Maddness> that sounds like it sucks
[2:24:51] <ScreamLord> They're still aware BTW
[2:24:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @queequegtheater Was just playing it yesterday LUL
[2:24:59] <peachy996> Space Bugs sting you and put you in a coma
[2:24:59] <Symmy_> Do they have like infinte traction since they dont seem to fall over
[2:25:00] <%Cykron> ICE to meet you
[2:25:02] <%Garthunox> would you rather we yell out TOTSUGEKI!?

[2:25:10] <%KetsuoTaberu> I'll take it
[2:25:10] <Dragovus> HEAVY WEAPON
[2:25:13] <%crazyspartan214> imagine that one guy who has to hold in his poop
[2:25:15] <peachy996> This weapon is not a Cain Nuke
[2:25:16] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It even continued with Andromeda, that has the best gameplay in the series
[2:25:17] <notsoy> TRICK SWORD GUN GUN
[2:25:17] <Samurai_Tchan> Collector gun collected
[2:25:19] <%BarujaraciGaming> @afronooch and an infuriating ship. every door is a load wall lol
[2:25:20] <Seth_Tek> how do bug bite cause space magic stasis field?
[2:25:20] <%Cykron> gun
[2:25:21] <jorniev> ME 1 GUN!?
[2:25:23] <The_Maddness> I assume they also cant fall asleep or unconscious or close their eyes
[2:25:24] <peachy996> Nor a Blackhole gun
[2:25:24] <BlackStarAura> I love this gun so much
[2:25:27] <%jillpilled> It sucks Andromeda tried so hard to do open world shit again, they clearly recognized how excluded it was from 2/3. Damn shame
[2:25:28] <Big_Buddy_Bawdy> gun?
[2:25:28] <%VashyronM> GUN
[2:25:29] <%maskedsongbird> *Insert Schwarzenegger ice pun here because I'm too lazy to come up with one*
[2:25:29] <%Cykron> Look a dude
[2:25:30] <%AzureGale> Shepard looked down and picked up WEPON
[2:25:30] <hereiam407> Time to put these jokes in the cooler
[2:25:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> Collector laser sucks if you're an infiltrator because it's just a sniper rifle replacement.
[2:25:35] <peachy996> Therefore it is inferior
[2:25:35] <feralspidey> This is some mt vesuvius right here
[2:25:37] <derap41> ugh Collector beam
[2:25:37] <%ainzhelm> @queequegtheater No it doesn’t lol

[2:25:57] <%afronooch> @BarujaraciGaming the "this is a load screen" room is the absolute worst
[2:25:58] <AmuserName> HELP COMPUTER
[2:26:00] <QuestlordJake> REEEEESTART
[2:26:01] <fugly_nick> YOU HAVE SO MUCH MONEY
[2:26:03] <Zalapski> start over from ME1
[2:26:04] <AthenaAegis> SPACE GOBLINS STRIKE AGAIN Kappa
[2:26:05] <+RyanTheRecluse> I'd still call ME3 a great game. It's got a lot of awesome moments and resolutions up till like the 90% mark. It's just the end is so terrible it taints the experience.
[2:26:05] <TourettesPlays> Pat you actually dont need them
[2:26:07] <+Cactuskris> nah Andromeda fights are the best
[2:26:09] <DSD24> Andromeda has cool dodges
[2:26:11] <%justnathan18> My favorite part of Andromeda is that the Genophage doesnt get cured because they miss it.
[2:26:12] <jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt if you use steam controller settings you can bind the share button to the quicksave keyboard command
[2:26:12] <Pookiedaexzile> I've never seen Andromeda not falling out of its own ass
[2:26:15] <thetunnelhomer> This Andromeda gaslighting is too much
[2:26:17] <+D00msDayDan> my first save was stuck at level 29 because i fucked up a hack and didn't have any DLC
[2:26:19] <%Cykron> How do they get frozen like that?
[2:26:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> ME3's ending isn't even as bad as people say.
[2:26:24] <Pookiedaexzile> And glitching like fuck
[2:26:24] <AmuserName> STOP ALL THE DOWNLOADIN'
[2:26:24] <$SGrim> @hoopray woooosh
[2:26:25] <NeroInfinite> "Get out of my way guy who can't move"
[2:26:26] <TourettesPlays> Theres one armor set on Illium you need to buy and thats it
[2:26:27] <peachy996> Andromeda had good shooting. Overall Gameplay? debatable
[2:26:28] <%BarujaraciGaming> @afronooch lol "stand here while we scan you for literally no reason"
[2:26:28] <+unhuggable1> same
[2:26:31] <+ColonelHandzLanza> Andromeda combat was worse even if the jetpack was fun. You have less options and control over your team
[2:26:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's a wet fart but it doesn't ruin the game.
[2:26:33] <derap41> and you got 4 choices
[2:26:33] <hereiam407> The bugs freeze them
[2:26:33] <DSD24> Lets gooooo!
[2:26:35] <%ainzhelm> I will fight anyone who says andromeda has the best combat. It’s flashy, but the gameplay loop is horrible. I’d rather 2
[2:26:36] <Dragovus> BOSS FIGHT!
[2:26:37] <%Cykron> Look at all these chickens
[2:26:38] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt if you fail a hack if you back out quick enough you can retry it
[2:26:39] <Goraka91> PogChamp
[2:26:40] <+unhuggable1> the only way it was different was if you killed everyone
[2:26:40] <SaltyAzteca> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
[2:26:43] <derap41> red green blue or ufck you
[2:26:43] <jackelzxaa> i got SUPER depressed by the ending about 5 months after release

[2:26:46] <Samurai_Tchan> OH flying craps from another dimension

[2:27:40] <$dalmek> damn what kinda nozzle you pee with to get that straight beam
[2:27:42] <fugly_nick> Particle beam sucks ass
[2:27:45] <Archmortal> @Too_Much_Nukie I thought stopping the reapers was the goal
[2:27:46] <peachy996> THIS HURTS YOU
[2:27:47] <%machshop> Pat "R. Kelly" Shepard
[2:27:47] <Samurai_Tchan> hamon these bastards
[2:27:48] <Ner234> If your pee looks like that get help
[2:27:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> The collector laser is used as a sniper rifle replacement.
[2:27:52] <%DracosMagala> I NOW YOU FEEL THIS
[2:27:54] <+ScrapKingKeita> URINE TROUBLE
[2:27:59] <+NickNackProductions> the ending of 3 is better if you prescribe to the indoctrination theory, too bad the devs basically confirmed it wasn't true because they're hack frauds
[2:27:59] <BlackStarAura> Gun’s great on Praetorians
[2:28:01] <Big_Buddy_Bawdy> I always felt like you could just, you know, tell your troops what to do instead of setting them on fire with your big mind penis
[2:28:03] <%Cykron> Look how hard I can pee
[2:28:03] <fugly_nick> Okay maybe particle beam doesn't suck
[2:28:05] <peachy996> THE FLESH
[2:28:07] <%Garthunox> MY SUPER LASER PISS!
[2:28:07] <+D00msDayDan> THIS HURTS YOU
[2:28:08] <%The_Review_Corps> krogan vanguard is the one thing i miss about ME3 in the new version. that was favorite
[2:28:10] <%barrakuta371> Collectors knew pre was the most damaging susbtance in the galaxy, so they made a gun out of it
[2:28:11] <%ainzhelm> Andromeda has better gameplay on paper. But 3 just feels so good.
[2:28:13] <hereiam407> Shepard stopped caring about the reapers, and learned he just really liked murder
[2:28:15] <%Garthunox> IM PISSING ON THE MOOOOON!
[2:28:15] <stantheman_97> booooo
[2:28:15] <peachy996> But the Priiiiize
[2:28:16] <Pookiedaexzile> The Particle Beam is the shit
[2:28:16] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Drip Drip Drip
[2:28:20] <%Cykron> HE PISSED ON MY WIFE
[2:28:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Archmortal That's the specific goal. You stop the reapers with every ending of 3 too. But the theme of Mass Effect has always been making compromises to survive.
[2:28:21] <nuane> is this horizon?
[2:28:24] <Samurai_Tchan> now when the police arrives they will blame you and not the collectors
[2:28:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Specially if you combo out of a charge
[2:28:30] <derap41> @fugly_nick Only not against basic collectors
[2:28:35] <%BarujaraciGaming> @pookiedaexzile nonono, particle beam is the PISS
[2:28:40] <jackelzxaa> the scion is the fucks
[2:28:40] <peachy996> The Scion is big boy
[2:28:42] <Goraka91> monkaS
[2:28:43] <Big_Buddy_Bawdy> they had names?
[2:28:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Archmortal That's the whole reason they had you work with Cerberus in this game.
[2:28:54] <%ape_hawk> you think the bugs froze someone mid-shit?
[2:28:55] <Archmortal> @Too_Much_Nukie I disagree, but in a way that takes too much text space to fruitfully discuss here
[2:29:02] <DSD24> ME 2 is such a good game
[2:29:02] <hereiam407> woohoo
[2:29:05] <SilasDrekken> a whole fun? wow
[2:29:06] <+D00msDayDan> scion is the gross one
[2:29:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Me too
[2:29:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> I mean they hit you over the head with it repeatedly.
[2:29:10] <QuestlordJake> fun go up
[2:29:13] <Ner234> Just ONE fun?
[2:29:15] <stantheman_97> scions are indeed the fucks

[2:29:20] <Pookiedaexzile> @BarujaraciGaming Try B Charge, Shot gun, Particle beam on anything
[2:29:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Shepard literally says it out loud at the start of 3.

[2:29:43] <%AzureGale> Super Mass Effect Bros.
[2:29:43] <%Maids4lyfe> imagine if the bugs froze someone mid climax and their nut got stuck
[2:29:44] <%Ranryu692> I would spend money to buy it again
[2:29:44] <The_Maddness> oh, its this asshole

[2:29:54] <jackelzxaa> thats so intentional isn't it
[2:29:56] <IntrepidEye> Being lazy saves lives again
[2:29:58] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Apparently the Multiplayer weapons are in the campaign for ME3
[2:29:59] <%Puffen0> I'll believe it when I see it. so far its just a rumor
[2:30:00] <TourettesPlays> oh my god I never got the eden prime parallel
[2:30:00] <%The_Review_Corps> KROGUARD RRBELLIONS!!!
[2:30:01] <James_Quivers> Yeah, I'll actually buy the LE if the MP comes back
[2:30:06] <jackelzxaa> i've played this game 30 fucking times and i never thought about him being a reference

[2:30:13] <Symmy_> yes ill now stare at this door for damatic effect
[2:30:16] <Goraka91> This guy shares a VA with Harbinger, I don't trust him
[2:30:19] <%ainzhelm> I used to solo Rio platinum as a volus all the time. With a hurricane
[2:30:20] <hereiam407> @IntrepidEye Too much stress kills

[2:30:54] <Pookiedaexzile> "Hey you smuggling any weapons"
[2:30:54] <The_Maddness> That doesnt make any sense
[2:30:54] <$realm_forge> This guy is from space New Jersey
[2:30:55] <derap41> Punch his bitch ass
[2:30:55] <%YakumoYomi> Damn Alliance!
[2:30:57] <%Ranryu692> thats kinda what happened
[2:30:58] <%The_Review_Corps> it attracted the bugs
[2:31:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> ME3 is a good game that was ruined by the ending and by word of mouth. People like Pat who loved the series didn't even play 3 because they heard about the ending out of context.
[2:31:02] <%The_Review_Corps> giant bug zapper
[2:31:05] <%Ravioli_Ronin> He sounds like that guy from that Amy game
[2:31:06] <%The_Review_Corps> bugs were too big
[2:31:08] <ScreamLord> It's da Gobermant's Falt!
[2:31:14] <Samurai_Tchan> WOWO , ITS BLAKE WEBBER
[2:31:14] <peachy996> Some kind of hero is a very fancy term for professional Bench Warmer
[2:31:19] <BlackStarAura> HERO MY ASS
[2:31:27] <hereiam407> ayy juiice
[2:31:29] <nesbitt22> WAIT the Multiplayer isn't in the legendary Edition?
[2:31:38] <stormhawk9891> That sounds like your fault tho
[2:31:40] <DSD24> @nesbitt22 Its not
[2:31:41] <%ainzhelm> This guy sounds like 40 different characters in fallout 4
[2:31:47] <%rockcentuar> It's kinda what happend
[2:31:47] <derap41> Yeah blame them for not fueling the gun they gave you
[2:31:49] <%The_Review_Corps> ayyyyye im from Brooklyn im walkin 'ere
[2:31:50] <ScreamLord> @nesbitt22 Yet
[2:31:57] <Pookiedaexzile> ME3 has good gameplay, but the story was bad the whole way down
[2:31:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah multiplayer and Pinnacle Station are the only missing things. Because both were made by a different company.
[2:31:57] <+chaumiester> Big Government bad
[2:32:00] <Pookiedaexzile> the tone was off
[2:32:00] <%Cykron> Space kinda sucks bro
[2:32:07] <Samurai_Tchan> pat should had made his sheppard look weird and funny
[2:32:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> Eyyy Space Pizza Pasta
[2:32:10] <jackelzxaa> there's a mass effect ova anime movie about James from ME3 getting attacked by collectors while shepard's doing all his sheparding stuff in ME2.
[2:32:14] <derap41> Damn GObment
[2:32:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pinnacle Station they tried to add in but the code was corrupted sot hey would have had to completely remake it.
[2:32:19] <jackelzxaa> the multiplayer was done by the montreal team wasn't it?
[2:32:20] <ScreamLord> That explains why it was good
[2:32:20] <nuane> that explains why people like it so much
[2:32:21] <Big_Buddy_Bawdy> space dumb go live on the citadel, nothing bad ever happens there
[2:32:21] <%machshop> well yeah it was good
[2:32:23] <jackelzxaa> so was omega dlc
[2:32:23] <SFTengu> Alliance? Don't you mean the Earth Federation?
[2:32:25] <+OneGorillionDollars> explains why it was so good amirite
[2:32:26] <derap41> trying to take our rights
[2:32:27] <jackelzxaa> aka the andromeda team
[2:32:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> @jackelzxaa Correct.
[2:32:33] <peachy996> I thought Bio Montreal was behind it
[2:32:41] <Archmortal> "I don't need their help" says a guy that watched nearly everyone get abducted without their help
[2:32:42] <Big_Buddy_Bawdy> did you say gun?
[2:32:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Calibrate, you say?
[2:32:42] <fugly_nick> Apparently Pinnacle Station was pretty meh anyway
[2:32:43] <ianabstract> should have brought garrus
[2:32:44] <ScreamLord> Garrus Intensifies
[2:32:45] <%machshop> LUL
[2:32:45] <Samurai_Tchan> Garrus can calibrate
[2:32:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Not a different company than Bioware. A different Bioware subsidiary.
[2:32:46] <jackelzxaa> i'm pretty sure Bioware Montreal did ME3 Multiplayer, Omega DLC, and Andromeda, yeah.
[2:32:46] <James_Quivers> The MP had WEEKLY balance patches, it was AMAZING
[2:32:46] <%Cykron> EYYYY I CAN'T EVEN GET A SPACE CANOLLI OUT HEAH
[2:32:49] <SaltyAzteca> She knows stuff! Some...stuff!
[2:32:49] <%za7az> LUL
[2:32:50] <%GalacticaPhanto> Zeig Zeon
[2:32:51] <stantheman_97> this is a job for garrus
[2:32:52] <peachy996> Jack saying Miranda's lines lol
[2:32:54] <%animaturgy> CALIBRATIONS
[2:32:54] <trianglehat> meth tho
[2:32:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat
[2:32:55] <%MugenSandan> REQUIRED PARAGON REPLY
[2:32:56] <%ainzhelm> @patstaresat I mean, that seems to happen all the time. Remember last of us multiplayer?
[2:32:56] <%Shubreaker> if only you brought Garrus
[2:33:00] <%YakumoYomi> I put more time into the ME3 MP than the campaign. Loads of fun on the Wii U.
[2:33:01] <%Cykron> Fucking coward
[2:33:02] <+chester804> i bet Garris could claibrate those guns
[2:33:02] <SpaceGuntank> if only you brought Garrus, he would've loved to "calibrate" those guns
[2:33:02] <%Dfreddy8> Says known math expert Patrick Boivin
[2:33:03] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Multiplayer also let you play as a Collector and Biotic Volus
[2:33:03] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt but she would certainly lie to save face.
[2:33:03] <slix3431> Prison math
[2:33:05] <Samurai_Tchan> in space ,everyone have the basics of information
[2:33:06] <nuane> my penis says to trust her
[2:33:09] <%barrakuta371> Yes, Jack and Grunt can totally calibrate those guns
[2:33:09] <BlackStarAura> Cerberus sucks but the Alliance isn’t much better TBF
[2:33:09] <+D00msDayDan> shoulda brought garrus
[2:33:09] <slix3431> Bully him
[2:33:10] <%The_Review_Corps> @Pookiedaexzile not the whole story about halfway through once the Cerberus stuff starts up bigtime
[2:33:11] <%jillpilled> Must be that prison educational system LUL
[2:33:11] <+FelIian> Pinnacle Station was missing because the PS source code was corrupted with no back up, so they decided not to include it at all for all versions
[2:33:13] <+MightyDuckShoes> knows more than grunt... maybe
[2:33:13] <jackelzxaa> they should have specially wrote these missions for if you bring the kill idiots like jack and grunt
[2:33:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cykron Eyyy Space Fongooool
[2:33:17] <slix3431> Bully him into helping
[2:33:17] <derap41> y a bitch
[2:33:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Multiplayer has many fun classes/species.
[2:33:20] <%Cykron> Yeah
[2:33:21] <%DracosMagala> WEEKLY BALANCE Kreygasm
[2:33:21] <DSD24> Yes
[2:33:22] <ScreamLord> YES
[2:33:23] <alroy900> if only we had someone who's good at making calibrations...
[2:33:23] <fugly_nick> Yes
[2:33:24] <jackelzxaa> i wonder if jack's ever fucked a krogan
[2:33:26] <%machshop> he is right
[2:33:27] <jackelzxaa> she could take it
[2:33:29] <DSD24> Do some Bioshock shit
[2:33:30] <Samurai_Tchan> in the futuru ,everyone has doctor level of information
[2:33:30] <BlackStarAura> The way they treat Shepard
[2:33:31] <James_Quivers> Gordon Freeman style
[2:33:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[2:33:37] <Zalapski> ayyyyy I'm wrenchin here
[2:33:38] <%Puffen0> hot take, I liked the mass effect 3 ending. its cause throughout the whole game the reapers are trying to indoctrinated Shepard. everything inside the Citadel is inside Shepards head while he's knocked out on early right underneath harbinger
[2:33:38] <%Shubreaker> worked for Ratchet
[2:33:39] <%ainzhelm> YES
[2:33:41] <stantheman_97> if your not a pussy, yeah
[2:33:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> Do it
[2:33:46] <jackelzxaa> jack could take the krogan nut and not die.
[2:33:52] <%machshop> Advanced Placement sniper rifle
[2:33:55] <+kekkerscrew> Grunt is such a good boy
[2:33:59] <peachy996> YAY BLACK HOLE GUN
[2:34:02] <ScreamLord> The Blackhole Gun is fun
[2:34:02] <Oxybe> Space Grease Monkey don't take no risks.
[2:34:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Any sentence that Starts with has jack fucked ends with "yes"
[2:34:05] <$renegade_blade> wrenches are strong, I played Bioshock
[2:34:08] <AthenaAegis> "Whado I look like here? The protag from BioShock?"
[2:34:10] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:34:10] <+FelIian> Grunt in Citadel is a treasure
[2:34:12] <%AzureGale> Ha

[2:35:44] <jackelzxaa> man i think you only kill about 30 collectors in direct combat in the whole game.  you spend so much more time fighting mercs
[2:35:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES SO COOL
[2:35:48] <Goraka91> monkaS

[2:50:55] <Goraka91> ...Yes
[2:50:56] <%TINMANxHMx> warcrimes are fine
[2:50:56] <%rekinom> Shepard was streaming on Twitch
[2:50:57] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt you know they'd hologram a dead shepard in an instant if they had the rights
[2:50:57] <mighty_fine_trousers> essentially forced dialogue to fit the story huh
[2:50:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Choose 2
[2:50:57] <TheMostAverageGamer4> yesss
[2:50:58] <+MrAtheGreat> This is Commander Shepard, and Kaiden is the dumbest motherfucker in the citadel
[2:50:58] <+ScrapKingKeita> I'm Commander Shepard and Horizon is my least favorite colony.
[2:50:59] <Broken_Sonex> HE JUST IGNORED THE FACT YOU COULDN'T TELL HIM YOUR WERE ALIVE
[2:50:59] <%TINMANxHMx> goodguy points
[2:51:00] <hereiam407> nailed option
[2:51:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck Cerbs
[2:51:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> getting that cheddar bro
[2:51:01] <LluthyY> "Paragon"
[2:51:03] <+Ghufufin> Lawful Stupid Engaged
[2:51:03] <peachy996> The VS is terrible here no matter what but Ash makes it worse
[2:51:04] <hereiam407> naive
[2:51:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt There's also a VI of you though
[2:51:06] <+MrAtheGreat> NEUTRAL
[2:51:07] <%maskedsongbird> "I said *Cerberus rebuilt me*, not *I'm with Cerberus*, Carth. Learn some fuckin' listening skills."
[2:51:07] <JetpackMcQuack> Flip those two
[2:51:07] <TheMostAverageGamer4> 3
[2:51:08] <%Nobrev> nah i'd pick 3
[2:51:10] <Pookiedaexzile> All my Homies hate Cerbs
[2:51:10] <%MidnightBurst12> depends on how it's worded
[2:51:12] <jackelzxaa> middle option seems like it's "be nice"
[2:51:13] <%TINMANxHMx> some eat shepards nuts
[2:51:16] <$lumporr> 33
[2:51:17] <Symmy_> @Too_Much_Nukie Yeah but not really all things considered
[2:51:19] <%Monkeyweed21> no those were Renegade options before @PatStaresAt
[2:51:20] <nuane> Cerberus isn't the enemy compared to the evil space bugs
[2:51:20] <Samurai_Tchan> chaotic neutral
[2:51:21] <+kekkerscrew> Is it a renegade option?
[2:51:24] <%mostdumbname> Think it's trying to say "The collectors are the real enemy here, not cerberus!"
[2:51:25] <dero45> maybe cerberus is controlling you after all
[2:51:29] <fugly_nick> That felt like a paragon line
[2:51:32] <%TINMANxHMx> kill him pat
[2:51:33] <TheMostAverageGamer4> thats paragon
[2:51:35] <Virokwet> this scene is the same with either virmire survivor.  imo
[2:51:35] <knight_verse> Kaidan wants your nuts Pat
[2:51:36] <stantheman_97> good guys like the human supremacist war crime terrorists group
[2:51:39] <crazy_riggs> TIM is a damned SAINT!
[2:51:41] <%maskedsongbird> Why is that labeled like a renegade option???
[2:51:44] <James_Quivers> GET OVER IT
[2:51:44] <AlphaRayAllen> GET OVER IT
[2:51:45] <%AncelDeLambert> nice to know he's as much of a bitch as Ashley
[2:51:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I HATE KAIDEN
[2:51:47] <JetpackMcQuack> :(
[2:51:48] <Samurai_Tchan> the way of the samurai have no biases
[2:51:49] <murdocismyhero> Kiss Kiss
[2:51:50] <jackelzxaa> kaiden thinks you've become ashley 2 that's why he's freaking out
[2:51:51] <+MrAtheGreat> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis BIOWARE BE CONSISTENT
[2:51:51] <%Cykron> It's gonna be ok buddy
[2:51:54] <Pookiedaexzile> @dero45 Oh no the Dialogue tree was indoctrination all along
[2:51:56] <%AzureGale> Good thing is this is the only time Kaidan appears in Mass Effect 2
[2:51:58] <%TINMANxHMx> kill this carth
[2:51:58] <AngryAsian5> Kaiden wants dat D
[2:52:00] <%maskedsongbird> SHUT THE FUCK UP CARTH
[2:52:00] <Agent_Sampson> Break his neck, make it quick
[2:52:01] <BlackStarAura> FUCK YOU KAIDAN
[2:52:01] <Goraka91> BRUH
[2:52:03] <+Cactuskris> Traitor!
[2:52:06] <+MrAtheGreat> KAIDEN IN KISSING RANGE LESSSS SSGOOOOO
[2:52:06] <peachy996> Kaiden is only get more distrustful in 3
[2:52:08] <%TINMANxHMx> he is so dumb
[2:52:11] <%Puffen0> the only humans I hate in the game are kadin and Ashley. everyone else is dope
[2:52:12] <+kekkerscrew> He's not wrong
[2:52:13] <BlackStarAura> Let Garrus shoot him in 3, Jesus fuck
[2:52:13] <%AncelDeLambert> interesting point, Kaiden, but... REAPERS
[2:52:15] <%maskedsongbird> That's weird to hear from Jack.
[2:52:15] <%barrakuta371> I feel like Maiden is ignoring the alien squadmate
[2:52:15] <knight_verse> Bruh, Kaidan, calm down and hold this grenade.
[2:52:16] <+coolthulhuu> TOO EMOTIONAL
[2:52:16] <fugly_nick> How does Kaiden recognize you without the mustache?
[2:52:17] <teefpal> That would be a much cooler plot, actually
[2:52:18] <+Ploobie> Haha Pat killed Ashley. I am so proud.
[2:52:19] <%Monkeyweed21> THATS FAIR
[2:52:20] <Goraka91> Fair
[2:52:22] <James_Quivers> EVEN JACK IS SPEAKING SENSE TO KAIDEN
[2:52:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[2:52:23] <Samurai_Tchan> yes, jack should be in charge here lol
[2:52:23] <%barrakuta371> *Kaiden
[2:52:24] <%weissguard> Jack being reasonable  is kinda nuts, tbh.
[2:52:26] <%maenos2> kaiden's anger is kind of amusing given what happens in 3...
[2:52:27] <+Buzzkill983> When JACK tells you to chill about Cerberus LUL
[2:52:30] <logothete2401> Very true
[2:52:30] <%Cykron> LUL LUL
[2:52:31] <peachy996> When Jack of ALL PEOPLE says chill out maybe you should chill out
[2:52:33] <AlphaRayAllen> Yes?
[2:52:33] <JetpackMcQuack> Evi;l's on pause for now
[2:52:33] <slix3431> So does this mean Ashley is dead?
[2:52:34] <%AncelDeLambert> that's an interesting idea, Kaiden, but need I remind you of REAPERS?!
[2:52:35] <+Ploobie> Ron Howard lookin' ass Shepard.
[2:52:36] <%TINMANxHMx> KILL
[2:52:36] <trianglehat> facts and logic
[2:52:40] <%TINMANxHMx> HIM
[2:52:40] <%AzureGale> Shepard destroys Kaidan with FACTS and LOGIC
[2:52:40] <+Cactuskris> biotic period much
[2:52:41] <s1rcuit> when the highly aggressive, violent criminal is more logical about this
[2:52:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Stop asking Bioware to be consistent, they invented races to hate, while promoting antiracism in dialogue
[2:52:45] <BurdRightsActivist> NO U
[2:52:45] <Agent_Sampson> Ooooh!! Let jack kill kaiden? SeemsGood
[2:52:47] <supergoblinpunch> Jack the voice of reason
[2:52:48] <ArchimerCXV> his qualms are made less bad, but it also doesn't help his script is INDENTICAL to Ashley here
[2:52:50] <Goraka91> To be fair it's entirely possible they could've put a mind control chip in Shepard
[2:52:50] <James_Quivers> FUCK ALLIANCE, HORDE FOR LIFE
[2:52:50] <%AncelDeLambert> "YOU'VE CHANGED!!!" He screams in his dad's face
[2:52:51] <%Maids4lyfe> Carth shut up
[2:52:52] <crazy_riggs> Imma go work with Revan, dude's going places!
[2:52:52] <%Cykron> Don't goooo
[2:52:53] <%Shubreaker> "facts don't care about feelings"
[2:52:55] <Symmy_> We got reinstated didnt we?
[2:52:55] <%ainzhelm> Cerberus forgot that it was a terrorist organization
[2:52:57] <dero45> dont go nooooooo
[2:52:57] <peachy996> Fat chance, fatass
[2:52:57] <%Puffen0> I just wanna smack kadin and show him the truth
[2:52:58] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, fuckim
[2:52:59] <Samurai_Tchan> @James_Quivers when jack tells you to chill out it means you fucked up
[2:53:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> THE ALLIANCE NEVER LIKED SHEPARD
[2:53:03] <tattleworm> don't go, teach me reave
[2:53:03] <%NopeBadguy> NO. DON'T GO.
[2:53:04] <+MrAtheGreat> @PatStaresAt Wait does this make saving Ashley make more sense narative wise because she was always bitchy?
[2:53:05] <%Monkeyweed21> ASHLEY IS AN EVEN BIGGER BITCH HERE BTW
[2:53:07] <%maskedsongbird> Okay, I mean, fair.
[2:53:09] <%bassoontyphoon> Kissssss hiiimmmmm
[2:53:10] <$SGrim> Kaiden, your L2 period is ruining this moment.
[2:53:10] <%MrMegaJackpots> aren't Cerberus big human supremecists? I wouldn't trust em either
[2:53:10] <+FelIian> and I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite cutscene in the game
[2:53:12] <%Cykron> We can be roomies!
[2:53:12] <Agent_Sampson> Cuuuurth, noooo
[2:53:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> WHY COULDNT KAIDEN DIE UGH
[2:53:14] <jackelzxaa> imagine if Ashley was willing to join but Kaiden wasn't.
[2:53:17] <Pookiedaexzile> So we fired Kaiden right
[2:53:19] <jackelzxaa> that'd be a hell of a change
[2:53:20] <%AzureGale> No, wait. Don't go.
[2:53:21] <%GalacticaPhanto> I'd make out with Kaiden ngl
[2:53:21] <peachy996> You could meet my buddy and your twin Jacob
[2:53:23] <blackjack8182> Why do Kaidan and Ashley have the SAME EXACT DIALOGUE!
[2:53:24] <stormhawk9891> NOPE
[2:53:25] <$KnivesEve> (monotone) no wait come back
[2:53:25] <AlphaRayAllen> Nope
[2:53:26] <+Cactuskris> no
[2:53:27] <dero45> misuFeels
[2:53:30] <fugly_nick> I think there's an extra line if you bring Garrus
[2:53:30] <%AzureGale> MISSION COMPLETE THEME
[2:53:30] <%maskedsongbird> Spoilers: it does not, in fact, matter at all.
[2:53:31] <thetunnelhomer> Garrus adds exactly one line
[2:53:32] <jackelzxaa> Kaiden DOES talk to garrus al ittle bit
[2:53:32] <+FelIian> it makes it twice as good when Garrus and Tali are with you LUL
[2:53:33] <+Cactuskris> it's one line
[2:53:33] <+Ploobie> Garrus wouldn't want to talk to Kaidan.
[2:53:34] <stormhawk9891> NOT AT ALL
[2:53:37] <Dragovus> Garrus and Kaiden have dialog
[2:53:38] <teefpal> Why is the plot so uninteresting?
[2:53:39] <%Gogogolem> I just want the option to shoot everyone who disagrees with em.
[2:53:39] <Goraka91> @jackelzxaa We meme, but even Ashley has standards
[2:53:41] <%W1nterTitan> There's like two lines of dialogue about him
[2:53:42] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Kaiden would just be like "Garrus too?" and that's it
[2:53:42] <%TINMANxHMx> Garrus is a true ride or die homie
[2:53:42] <James_Quivers> This is even funnier with Ashley instead, because she would be SUPER DOWN WITH CERBERUS
[2:53:43] <stantheman_97> no but it could have good dialog
[2:53:44] <%Dfreddy8> "I tried so hard, at the end it doesn't even matter"
[2:53:44] <%hrbeck_> why would anything matter?
[2:53:46] <%TINMANxHMx> carth is a bitch
[2:53:46] <$SGrim> @blackjack8182 It requires less planning for the plot.
[2:53:47] <%CalderGaming> okay but you didn't bring garrus
[2:53:48] <+kekkerscrew> Well Garrus became a space vigilante
[2:53:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @MrMegaJackpots Cerberus is the rogue spec ops division of the alliance they're basically the Space CIA they are super evil
[2:53:50] <%AzureGale> Garrus: Bruh
[2:53:50] <knight_verse> Good riddance, let him stay with the space hick
[2:53:52] <$Ziegsy> hey todd
[2:54:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Illusive man smoking that Eclusive Pack
[2:54:06] <%maskedsongbird> It really shows who your friends are though because Garrus and Tali stood by you when your supposed human bestie does not.
[2:54:07] <peachy996> Actually Ashley hates you even more bc you're with Cerberus
[2:54:07] <Samurai_Tchan> a talktive team mate is better than grunt
[2:54:08] <%NopeBadguy> man these pants look ugly with this hoodie
[2:54:12] <%bassoontyphoon> Or the fact that non humans are with you
[2:54:15] <jackelzxaa> half of the colony would be almost 350,000 people
[2:54:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> God you look like a nerd
[2:54:17] <%ainzhelm> He does that if you bring him
[2:54:20] <+MrAtheGreat> BIG GOO ILLUSIVE MAN! BIG! GOO!
[2:54:20] <jackelzxaa> thats so big
[2:54:21] <+redthebaron> the mechanic was rude to me
[2:54:27] <JetpackMcQuack> P O R E S
[2:54:29] <Samurai_Tchan> sure  thing ,max payne
[2:54:33] <fugly_nick> The collectors are trying to initiate human instrumentality
[2:54:36] <Goraka91> @James_Quivers She straight up hates Cerberus though? She's a racist not a terrorist
[2:54:37] <s1rcuit> it is I CLAYFACE
[2:54:42] <%bassoontyphoon> They’re being turned into gamer goo
[2:54:43] <nuane> no, it was the mall speakers
[2:54:44] <teefpal> It's actually super easy to be alive
[2:54:45] <+Cactuskris> yes
[2:54:55] <%Mattais88> He killed the entire olony
[2:54:57] <Agent_Sampson> Hungry eyes..
[2:54:58] <%TINMANxHMx> Illusive man is goated
[2:54:59] <+MrAtheGreat> Wow it's almost like Cerberus is made up by a bunch of exteremists or sometihng
[2:54:59] <BlackStarAura> “FRIEND”
[2:55:00] <+Cactuskris> based illusive man
[2:55:00] <AlphaRayAllen> The Collectors are lame
[2:55:00] <%TINMANxHMx> gigachad
[2:55:03] <logothete2401> See this is why Kaiden is actually kind of justified
[2:55:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Palpatine's behind it all.
[2:55:05] <+Tucker0603> man I fucking hate the illusive man
[2:55:05] <peachy996> the first of many calculated risks
[2:55:06] <%maskedsongbird> Man the Illusive Man is such a fucknugget.
[2:55:11] <+Qexec> makes sense actually
[2:55:13] <murdocismyhero> Doesn't he turn into a reaper? its been years since I played this.
[2:55:16] <peachy996> Illusive but not Smart
[2:55:26] <jackelzxaa> In Mass Effect you ARE able to interface your brain into technology and cyber worlds, so the human reaper thing isn't COMPLETELY STUPID, it's just explained VERY POORLY.
[2:55:26] <%The_Review_Corps> what happens when you bring a boomer to space
[2:55:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> @murdocismyhero He is indoctrinated in 2.
[2:55:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> I mean 3.
[2:55:35] <peachy996> No but he was gonna turn into a Reaper Freak
[2:55:37] <teefpal> Everyone gets dumber the futher you go into the series
[2:55:39] <Goraka91> @murdocismyhero He turns into a budget Saren for no reason yes
[2:55:40] <murdocismyhero> gotcha
[2:55:47] <AlphaRayAllen> Uh huh
[2:55:48] <%Cykron> Don't tell me what I can fuck
[2:55:53] <Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 No.
[2:55:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> Martin Sheen more like Martin Peen
[2:56:00] <%Cykron> AGILE
[2:56:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 He was going to try to control the reapers.
[2:56:03] <+MrAtheGreat> STRONG
[2:56:03] <jackelzxaa> the humans are melted into resources so it can live forever and their brains are uploaded into its core to become its intelligence
[2:56:05] <%bread_assassin> Jack was tortured since she was a  child in a Cerberus facility, and unlike Kaiden/Ashley, she's still willing to work with them for the greater good.
[2:56:06] <%SirGO0SE> he dont know about that blussy
[2:56:06] <+Buzzkill983> Virile even
[2:56:15] <$realm_forge> For being so pro human the illusive man bangs a lot of aliens
[2:56:16] <crazy_riggs> The strength of 20 Pats
[2:56:19] <%ExpressNode> psaBig
[2:56:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Freakers= Collectors
[2:56:21] <%UvBenServed> So as strong as Zangeif

[2:56:23] <%barrakuta371> The strength of 5 chihuahuas
[2:56:23] <teefpal> "Do the loyalty missions, Commander"
[2:56:24] <Agent_Sampson> Built different
[2:56:25] <FassieFons> as strong as a bajilion zangiefs
[2:56:25] <%Shubreaker> doorseeays
[2:56:27] <fugly_nick> Time to go get best girl
[2:56:28] <%afronooch> what no blussy does to a mfer
[2:56:30] <James_Quivers> PRIIIIZE
[2:56:32] <jackelzxaa> jack wants to work with them so she can get the thing she wants
[2:56:32] <BlackStarAura> 5 dogs or one GIEF
[2:56:32] <crazy_riggs> SHUT UP KANYE!
[2:56:35] <%justnathan18> How many times do you think people touched Shep's schlong while Cerberus was rebuilding him
[2:56:36] <Shatterthought> heavy risk, but the priizzeeee
[2:56:36] <trianglehat> heavy risk, but the prize
[2:56:38] <RushUnplugged> TIM is so fucking slimy
[2:56:38] <teefpal> Hey its other carth
[2:56:38] <Samurai_Tchan> Collect my nuts you ass
[2:56:40] <Lamokmok> Man, seeing this again after ME3, Kaiden/Ashley were right
[2:56:40] <Goraka91> @realm_forge It's almost like those kind of people are massive hypocrites or something
[2:56:40] <peachy996> @Too_Much_Nukie Look up what they were going to do with him at the end of ME3. They gave him a new design and scrapped it
[2:56:43] <%W1nterTitan> Best girl time!
[2:56:45] <peachy996> Too videogamey
[2:56:47] <Samurai_Tchan> OMG ITS KANYE WEST
[2:56:48] <+Cactuskris> loalty man it's important
[2:56:48] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL
[2:56:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Keep in mind you can only do 5 missions before the next main mission starts.
[2:56:49] <%drabberfaun535> Kaiden butthurt that you work for TIm
[2:56:51] <%maskedsongbird> @crazy_riggs OMG, he DOES look like Kanye!!
[2:56:52] <%Cykron> Charlie Sheen is just jealous of the blussy
[2:56:53] <slix3431> @crazy_riggs HE DOES LOOK LIKE KANYE
[2:56:55] <%GalacticaPhanto> @fassiefons That's stronger than a God
[2:56:59] <peachy996> In fairness it would have been terrible
[2:57:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 Scrapped designs aren't canon foo
[2:57:03] <Goraka91> But the priiiiize (fuck you Jacob, you're actually the worst)
[2:57:04] <Samurai_Tchan> hahahahahhahahaa
[2:57:07] <jackelzxaa> jacob: "We're gonna start asking about loyalty missions"
[2:57:14] <peachy996> I know it's not cannon
[2:57:16] <tattleworm> that really sounds like he's gonna go jerk off
[2:57:17] <blackjack8182> Nobody cares what you think Jacob
[2:57:17] <slix3431> The people who were taken by collecters chose to become collectors
[2:57:17] <+MrAtheGreat> "Maybe loyalty missions" wink wink
[2:57:21] <Agent_Sampson> Jacob's just meh
[2:57:22] <%maskedsongbird> Man, could you imagine if Jacob was ACTUALLY voiced by Kanye?
[2:57:25] <%W1nterTitan> Yeah but it's not forced
[2:57:25] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Yes, the collector ship
[2:57:26] <+Cactuskris> yes
[2:57:27] <%Cykron> Is that what he tells femshep before he cheats on her?
[2:57:27] <Samurai_Tchan> OH my god, i never thought he looked like kanye
[2:57:29] <Symmy_> IFF
[2:57:29] <RushUnplugged> no
[2:57:29] <peachy996> But it still looked dumb
[2:57:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 They were going to make ME2 Shepard half-geth. That doesn't mean he's half-geth now.
[2:57:31] <%Mattais88> Yeah, five until collector ship
[2:57:33] <%NopeBadguy> Collector Ship

[2:57:41] <%drabberfaun535> collecter ship
[2:57:41] <FennecZephyr> No, reaper IFF you can trigger whenever
[2:57:43] <fugly_nick> I don't think you need to worry
[2:57:44] <%Garthunox> collector ship

[2:57:45] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt The Collector Ship is next

[2:58:16] <%bread_assassin> Do you need to ask?
[2:58:18] <%ainzhelm> Yeah
[2:58:18] <%Mattais88> Collecter ship is when you get the super weapons too
[2:58:20] <%maskedsongbird> Charge is the blatantly correct answer.
[2:58:20] <%maenos2> CHAAARGE
[2:58:20] <MrPandastic> CHARGE
[2:58:21] <%AzureGale> Charge
[2:58:21] <+Tucker0603> CHARGE!!!!

[2:58:36] <%maskedsongbird> CORRECT
[2:58:37] <$Solid_Stro> Deez Nuts
[2:58:37] <%Dfreddy8> AMMO
[2:58:38] <jackelzxaa> if you're clever you can actually get miranda's loyalty mission and the lair of the shadow broker dlc after hitting the 5 mission cap (that's what i always do, feels cool to do all the illium stuff in a row)
[2:58:39] <RushUnplugged> that 1 point in cryo is wasted TBH
[2:58:39] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Max Cryo Ammo then make it Squad Cryo
[2:58:40] <Pookiedaexzile> YYYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:58:46] <%BubbaRands> oOOOOOh you tease Kreygasm
[2:58:46] <fugly_nick> MORE CHARGE
[2:58:49] <jackelzxaa> level 4 charge is good
[2:58:49] <crazy_riggs> Every class' main ability is the BEST
[2:58:50] <%Monkeyweed21> this bit got kinda old by the end of ME1
[2:58:51] <Wolfstriker121> so when all the normandy crew gets kidnapped...pat needs to rescue them asap?  or get can go around for a bit?
[2:58:57] <%maskedsongbird> MOAR CHARGE
[2:59:02] <fugly_nick> HEAVY CHARGE
[2:59:03] <%Monkeyweed21> HEAVY
[2:59:03] <%justnathan18> Reaperfied Illusiveman looks cool AF
[2:59:06] <Strigiform> time stop 1.
[2:59:07] <+Buzzkill983> I usually go Heavy
[2:59:08] <thetunnelhomer> Heavy Charge gives you a time stop
[2:59:09] <%Mattais88> Time slow is great
[2:59:09] <%AzureGale> Heavy charge seems better
[2:59:10] <%snow_bush> Heavy
[2:59:11] <peachy996> I used Heavy
[2:59:11] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt HEAVY CHARGE IS DEFENSIVE AS FUCK
[2:59:12] <%The_Review_Corps> HEAVY!!
[2:59:12] <%snow_bush> Big dick hit
[2:59:12] <LluthyY> i like heavy
[2:59:13] <%W1nterTitan> Personal choice
[2:59:13] <AmuserName> always heavy
[2:59:13] <Pookiedaexzile> 1
[2:59:13] <nuane> HEAVY
[2:59:14] <RushUnplugged> Area is kinda lame, Heavy is ABSURDLY GOOD
[2:59:16] <Pookiedaexzile> !
[2:59:16] <tattleworm> slowdown in heavy charge is great for big headshots
[2:59:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> How much more before you can Potemkin Buster?
[2:59:17] <%shurtal> Heavy
[2:59:17] <Shatterthought> I don't think I ever bothered using area charge, Heavy is too good
[2:59:19] <%maskedsongbird> I prefer heavy charge myself. Makes your dick feel huge
[2:59:19] <Pookiedaexzile> 1 is 2
[2:59:19] <SpaceGuntank> Heavy charge still gives you an AOE, Area sucks
[2:59:19] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Do you want diet Adrenaline Rush or an AOE
[2:59:20] <%NateyBeak> Heavy in case you fight just 1 guy
[2:59:21] <GustauveVIII> HEAVY 100% SHIELDS
[2:59:22] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Do garrus's Loyal missions for AP Ammo, then respec and ignore Cryo and Incendiary
[2:59:22] <peachy996> The brief time slow helped
[2:59:22] <MrPandastic> Heavy is my goto
[2:59:24] <%athuramn> heavy,  area charge falls off hard @patstaresat
[2:59:25] <James_Quivers> I know you wanna bring legion to tali's loyalty mission, but does that leave you enough time to get that quarussy?
[2:59:25] <ianabstract> HEAVY to enter the stopped time
[2:59:27] <TourettesPlays> Slow down on heavy charge is Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:59:28] <Wolfstriker121> heavy = you become dio
[2:59:28] <RushUnplugged> Heavy has the TIME STOP
[2:59:29] <Archmortal> always Heavy
[2:59:30] <%PhantomMiG> Heavy all the way
[2:59:30] <%kyh9> Oh heavy for sure
[2:59:31] <+Tucker0603> heavy, you get time slow
[2:59:31] <%Monkeyweed21> SLOW MO IS BUSTED
[2:59:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Wolfstriker121 You get a set amount of missions based on how many missions you have left to do. It's best to rescue them immediately after the IFF though.
[2:59:32] <$realm_forge> HEAVY
[2:59:32] <crazy_riggs> HEAVY! If it's a group, you can just use shockwave as none will be as strong as the main guy
[2:59:33] <%bread_assassin> Lower difficulties -area. Higher difficulties - heavy.
[2:59:34] <fugly_nick> You  do charge into groups a lot though, so area might be good
[2:59:36] <Jmann1892> Heavy
[2:59:36] <Pookiedaexzile> 1 is too because the slow down turns you into MAx payne
[2:59:37] <%ape_hawk> DOSSIER: THE COOL PEOPLE
[2:59:41] <+MrAtheGreat> "within range" is a term for pussies
[2:59:41] <knight_verse> YOU CAN RESET YOUR POINTS IN MORDIN'S ROOM IF YOU WANT TO MIN/MAX
[2:59:41] <%kyh9> Heavy is needed for some of the tougher enemies
[2:59:42] <+TheBitingIrish> Heavy because KONO DIO DA
[2:59:43] <TourettesPlays> Man FUCK the Justicar
[2:59:47] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA THANE
[2:59:49] <jackelzxaa> lair of the shadow broker is the best mission in the game

[2:59:52] <+NickNackProductions> Plant man Thane
[2:59:55] <jackelzxaa> it's better than the suicide mission
[2:59:55] <Pookiedaexzile> if you pick 1, you can fuck up groups with the slow down
[2:59:56] <fugly_nick> I hate the justicar
[3:00:01] <%kyh9> Kasumi and Zaeed have some of the best loyalty missions
[3:00:03] <%maskedsongbird> @TourettesPlays Like, literally, or...?
[3:00:04] <%shadowsofpain> Time for lizard man

[3:00:36] <%maskedsongbird> You have just unlocked the power of min/maxing.
[3:00:37] <BlackStarAura> ARRIVAL
[3:00:39] <murdocismyhero> Don't let the fish die
[3:00:39] <crazy_riggs> Upgrade heavy weapons to unlock the BEST heavy weapon in the game

[3:00:50] <BlackStarAura> That’s the email
[3:00:51] <Samurai_Tchan> Chad dowbroker
[3:00:52] <Wolfstriker121> WHAT?!!\
[3:00:54] <+Cactuskris> fish
[3:00:56] <Wolfstriker121> HOW
[3:00:58] <%maskedsongbird> Sure did. Don't do it till post game, though.
[3:01:00] <Shatterthought> yeah the timing of that is... badly placed
[3:01:00] <tattleworm> uh huh
[3:01:01] <%afronooch> yea
[3:01:02] <peachy996> Yeah it's way too early
[3:01:02] <%kyh9> Arrival can be done pre-end
[3:01:02] <$Ziegsy> @TheLakinessMonster when youve capped str ye
[3:01:03] <%NopeBadguy> DO NOT DO ARRIVAL UNTIL POST GAME
[3:01:04] <jackelzxaa> arrival is partially rewritten if you play it early
[3:01:06] <RushUnplugged> yes Arrival can be played before, they tweak the text
[3:01:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I TOLD YOU
[3:01:10] <stantheman_97> NOW??
[3:01:14] <Agent_Sampson> It's dumb yeah
[3:01:14] <fugly_nick> Yeah Arrival shows up way too early
[3:01:15] <Goraka91> How the fuck
[3:01:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Kelly will feed your fish if you forget
[3:01:17] <Lamokmok> Did Pat already strip mine every planet off screen?
[3:01:18] <jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt there are changes to arrival and lair of the shadowbroker depending on when you play it
[3:01:18] <%shadowsofpain> don't even think about it, don't look at it, don't shake it's hand
[3:01:19] <+Buzzkill983> Never do Arrival early. Only Villains do that
[3:01:20] <%maskedsongbird> It really is
[3:01:21] <%kyh9> You basically see Collector Harbinger instead of Reaper Harbinger at the end
[3:01:24] <%Puffen0> I liked the mass effect 3 ending. throughout the whole game the reapers are trying to indoctrinated Shepard, everything with the star child is inside Shepards head while he's knocked out the final choice is whether or not Shepard accepts the reapers. blue is what illusive man wants, leading him to just be indoctrinated. green is what saren wanted which also lead to him being indoctrinated. red is EXACTLY what you've been fighting for the whole game, the destruction of the reapers. @patstaresat
[3:01:25] <crazy_riggs> OVERLORD! The best DLC in ME2
[3:01:33] <peachy996> It ruins the (still weak) Harbinger twist at the end
[3:01:35] <jackelzxaa> arrival should at the very least show up after the collector ship maybe or the reaper iff
[3:01:35] <Wolfstriker121> it should have popped after you beat the game imo
[3:01:36] <%king_wragles> Did Pat feed the fish?
[3:01:41] <TourettesPlays> Pat there's super good DLC armor on Illium
[3:01:42] <peachy996> It's not even a twist really
[3:01:45] <jackelzxaa> after horizon is too early
[3:01:46] <%TheLakinessMonster> @Ziegsy Gotcha. thanks dude!
[3:01:48] <fugly_nick> @crazy_riggs Except for the Hammerhead stuff
[3:01:55] <+Tucker0603> is there a post game? I forget
[3:01:58] <blackjack8182> They did nothing to dish out DLC appropriatly
[3:02:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt dont worry, Kelly will feed the fish if you forget
[3:02:01] <jackelzxaa> i prefer to play arrival RIGHT before the suicide mission for reasons
[3:02:05] <tattleworm> it took more effort to make it pre and post, assume it's some dumb ea thing saying more people'll buy it
[3:02:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @Tucker0603 yea
[3:02:06] <%Puffen0> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[3:02:07] <%NateyBeak> POO 4
[3:02:07] <%maskedsongbird> Arrival: Shepard commits a war crime. *Always sunny music plays*
[3:02:09] <peachy996> There's a post game
[3:02:09] <+D00msDayDan> but then if you just turned the game off when you hit credits you'd never see the DLC you paid for
[3:02:10] <Broken_Sonex> @Puffen0 No one is reading all of that
[3:02:12] <+D_A_K> "feed the dog" is slang for pooping again, right?
[3:02:12] <fugly_nick> Pat's gotta shit again
[3:02:14] <%KetsuoTaberu> poo #4
[3:02:22] <%BarujaraciGaming> and a secret poop
[3:02:22] <LluthyY> we know hes pooing
[3:02:23] <%JamesCorck> Man, holyshit.
[3:02:25] <%shadowsofpain> aka time to shit out his guts part 4
[3:02:31] <%AzureGale> Oh yeah, he did say 10 PM is Gief's new feeding tiem
[3:02:34] <%justnathan18> roughly 18% of this stream has been poopies
[3:02:35] <Pookiedaexzile> He Shitted
[3:02:37] <%Puffen0> @broken_sonex you just did lol
[3:02:38] <Wolfstriker121> all these mission popping up..its like so out of order...overlord is after shoadow broker or before?
[3:02:39] <Oxybe> Mass Eject 4.
[3:02:42] <+D_A_K> like, "take the kids to the pool" "take the browns to the superbowl" etc
[3:02:42] <Wolfstriker121> shadow*
[3:02:43] <%maskedsongbird> Shit 4: Shittribution.
[3:02:43] <knight_verse> @monkeyweed21 Not anymore she won't, I think Pat ruined it.
[3:02:46] <BlackStarAura> SPICY
[3:02:51] <+D_A_K> he's definitely pooping again
[3:03:06] <+MightyDuckShoes> No. He has to feed the dog. He also has to poop. You connect the dots
[3:03:06] <%maskedsongbird> Good time to take a piss break, methinks.
[3:03:10] <peachy996> I'm not saying The Illusive Man being a Brute is canon I'm saying it was dumb
[3:03:15] <RushUnplugged> Overlord is whenever, no real time issue there
[3:03:16] <Broken_Sonex> @Puffen0 I didn't.
[3:03:23] <Pookiedaexzile> @D_A_K Its funny how one of those is daily, and the Browns will never go to the Superbowl
[3:03:37] <peachy996> It looked dumb, the idea was dumb, it would have been a dumb mistake etc
[3:03:43] <knight_verse> Did Par get himself into a shitty situation again?
[3:03:54] <knight_verse> *Pat
[3:04:06] <fugly_nick> @knight_verse He shit himself on stream again
[3:04:06] <%JoshManVGH> Just making it to the Stream, what's Pat played up to?
[3:04:06] <%Puffen0> nah just has to pee
[3:04:32] <%Puffen0> @joshmanvgh he got jack, and just ran into kadin
[3:04:37] <jackelzxaa> pat beat horizon
[3:04:44] <jackelzxaa> which means first half of squad
[3:04:51] <%Puffen0> psaCanada psaCanada
[3:04:54] <+senfood> RELOAD
[3:04:55] <knight_verse> @fugly_nick .... Perfect.
[3:05:06] <%JoshManVGH> Noice, was he friendly to Kaidin or did he tell him to fuck off?
[3:05:06] <%maskedsongbird> psaCanada
[3:05:13] <Pookiedaexzile> There's too many good characters for a 2 person party
[3:05:19] <jackelzxaa> he tried his best to not be a dick to kaiden
[3:05:24] <Pookiedaexzile> I wanna squad up 4 plus Shepard
[3:05:26] <%maskedsongbird> @JoshManVGH It was kind of neutral, actually.
[3:05:27] <peachy996> He was friendly but Kaiden told him to fuck off
[3:05:32] <%Puffen0> @joshmanvgh well I mean. kadin told him to fuck of soooo
[3:05:48] <TourettesPlays> @JoshManVGH His Batarian Bloodlust is so strong we're doing Arrival right now
[3:05:49] <jackelzxaa> i really like what me3 does with the kaiden stuff from horizon
[3:05:58] <jackelzxaa> also anderson has new dialog now if you ask about kaiden
[3:06:09] <%Puffen0> wait, its spelt Kaiden? thats so fucking pretentious lol
[3:06:21] <%JoshManVGH> Oh good to know! I should go back Citadel.
[3:06:23] <TourettesPlays> @jackelzxaa okay that i didnt know becuase who the hell returns to anderson after the initial meeting
[3:06:26] <%maskedsongbird> @Puffen0 Why?
[3:06:33] <+MightyDuckShoes> you really can't do anything to salvage things in ME2 with Kaiden or Ashley
[3:06:40] <%JoshManVGH> @puffen0 It's thr scifi future spelling of Cayden.
[3:06:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Cayden looks like the Scifi one
[3:07:14] <jackelzxaa> @jackelzxaa i've done "find hidden dialog" runs of these games lol
[3:07:16] <%NateyBeak> he's feeding the dog and a toilet
[3:07:22] <peachy996> @MightyDuckShoes Which is a shame bc I thought that was what the last ME2 DLC would be instead of Arrival. Or at least have them help
[3:07:25] <%maskedsongbird> Isn't Kaiden Canadian? Might explain why he got saved on Virmire, lol
[3:07:25] <jackelzxaa> oops that was meant to eb for tourettesplays
[3:07:26] <%JoshManVGH> I may not honestly know how to spell Cahidine
[3:07:28] <+MightyDuckShoes> it's just Aiden with a K.
[3:07:30] <%Puffen0> @maskedsongbird its just feels that way to me imo. gives me strong white people trying to be "unique" vibes
[3:07:30] <jackelzxaa> the button didn't click right
[3:07:35] <peachy996> It would have improved the DLC imo
[3:07:56] <%Puffen0> @mightyduckshoes omg.
[3:08:03] <RushUnplugged> both are variants of Caden, so
[3:08:09] <%BarujaraciGaming> BIG POOPERS
[3:08:19] <%JoshManVGH> Mortal Kaiden!
[3:08:35] <jackelzxaa> There used to be a chart on the Bioware Community Forums someone painstakingly built that had a count for every single squadmate dialog in missions or on the hubs and who they have unique interactions with.  it didn't get archived to the wiki but it was a valuable resource for figuring out my favorite squad comps per mission.
[3:08:39] <Pookiedaexzile> @RushUnplugged  Kah-den
[3:08:40] <%Puffen0> @maskedsongbird yeah he's from Vancouver iirc
[3:08:40] <$Ziegsy> seems gief also had the forean
[3:08:44] <fugly_nick> Damn Pat's taking a long shit
[3:08:44] <$Ziegsy> *korean
[3:08:48] <jackelzxaa> so you just knew who had the most from that
[3:09:03] <+MightyDuckShoes> @peachy996 Nope. Good ol forced drama with the game giving you zero obvious dialogue choices. I can't believe Shepard can't say he was dead.
[3:09:09] <peachy996> I think I remember using that chart too
[3:09:33] <%BarujaraciGaming> psaPat shit psaPat shIT psaPat SHIT psaFist cmoncmoncmon psaPat psaFist psaPat psaFist psaPat psaFist psaBig psaUp
[3:09:36] <jackelzxaa> me3 is a round two on the horizon dispute thing and they do a pretty good job of it
[3:09:59] <jackelzxaa> the real reason was they didnt want you to be able to kill liara or the virmire survivor in 2, since they wanted to use them in 3 without worry of character death

[3:24:01] <%YakumoYomi> Jacob REALLY looks like Kanye West...and it bothers me
[3:24:03] <peachy996> Jacob is closed off all the time
[3:24:09] <%JoshManVGH> Cerberus trying to force them to reconnect.
[3:24:11] <%BarujaraciGaming> @zuzuxiv nah he's being cold hearted.....
[3:24:13] <+Punchasaur> i'm just tryna vibe
[3:24:14] <+barristerofthebar> oh Miranda
[3:24:15] <ioci2112> jacob is a black man with an absent father, you can make your own conclusions about what bioware tried to say
[3:24:17] <BlackStarAura> Jacob is a walking stereotype
[3:24:23] <+wmeldrum> some kinda..... mass effect huh?
[3:24:26] <%JoshManVGH> "Just meet him where he is, Jacob!"
[3:24:33] <%afronooch> jacob also cheats on you
[3:24:34] <+zuzuxiv> alright cool

[3:24:49] <+barristerofthebar> I had forgotten about the constant ship hum
[3:24:51] <%ape_hawk> he went out for a pack of space cigarettes and never came back
[3:24:53] <+barristerofthebar> Ooof
[3:24:55] <peachy996> That's less about race and more about Daddy Issues. The loyalty missions are all about Daddy
[3:24:56] <%Cykron> The Hugo Boss
[3:25:03] <%BarujaraciGaming> @punchasaur "I'm just trying to vibe" yet tries to shut down others harmless fun. get over yourself, the world doesn't start and stop when you want it to
[3:25:03] <%afronooch> yeah
[3:25:07] <%YakumoYomi> Family Family Family...
[3:25:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes Jacob is a walking Sterotype, and the only cheater on your crew, but spacism is wrong, and Batarians are all evil
[3:25:09] <jackelzxaa> for some reason jacob gets quite a bit of extra dialog for his investigate prompts updating throughout the game.  joker gets a little bit too.  anything that's "What's the status of the stuff?" has a few tiny updates and changes as you go through the game
[3:25:13] <%Parapattern> Jacob: "I am soldier man. I have family."
[3:25:18] <%Dfreddy8> MY MOMMA

[3:25:40] <%justcallmebobplease> justcallmebobplease subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! This Nintendo Switch download error 2123-1502 is ridiculous, and I hate that so many things are releasing - which I bought for digital download - that I'm going to be jumping through hoops to try and get at through the error.
[3:25:41] <+kekkerscrew> Mordin!
[3:25:43] <%Puffen0> lotta projecting here on Jacob lol
[3:25:47] <+wmeldrum> dude having mordin next to jacob is unfortunate for jacob
[3:25:49] <+Punchasaur> can't let it go
[3:25:52] <$RealThiele> warcrimes blah blah blah
[3:25:52] <jackelzxaa> i love that mordin gets alot of "no more dialog" dialog so he's at least fun to keep bothering.
[3:25:59] <+Tucker0603> everyone have a good night
[3:26:10] <%ainzhelm> I actually like his loyalty mission. It’s a nice self contained story. But it does NOTHING to develop his character

[3:27:22] <mcsassafras> yeah shepard know you betrayed us take this sensitive mission
[3:27:22] <%Monkeyweed21> IT IS IT WAS MEANT TO BE THAT YOU BUY THE DLC AND THEN LOAD YOUR COMPLETED SAVE
[3:27:23] <TioXyco> if you got the DLC you would be notified this early too on the PS3
[3:27:27] <+kekkerscrew> It's Arrival?  Now?
[3:27:29] <+zuzuxiv> yes please save us from C H A O S
[3:27:30] <%The_Review_Corps> JUST SAY NO!

[3:27:33] <peachy996> UGH Kenson....actually it's not her fault
[3:27:39] <%ainzhelm> I mean just think. They where probably designed so that it would trigger as soon as you bought the dlc
[3:27:41] <aiutare47> That’s arrival, do that last
[3:27:42] <ingman112> Yeah this is something mods move to later. Don’t do it til after beating the game
[3:27:45] <Dunmarkh> WE HAVE ARRIVED
[3:27:46] <%Dfreddy8> This isn't a Daycare
[3:27:47] <%machshop> do this last
[3:27:51] <%Puffen0> just say no Shepard!

[3:28:03] <%walternatorz> "Possible reaper invasion. Send one person"
[3:28:05] <RushUnplugged> technically it works at any time, but it's blatantly made to be the last thing before ME3
[3:28:07] <peachy996> Bruh the reapers
[3:28:08] <Samurai_Tchan> BRUH the reapers
[3:28:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Just ME3 the writing gets worse in this DLC
[3:28:20] <%Rain_Mage> Ah yes, "Reapers"
[3:28:27] <%Dfreddy8> Ah yes "Reapers"
[3:28:34] <jackelzxaa> arrival is the "oh right, we didnt do anything reapers related in me2" mission

[3:28:42] <BurdRightsActivist> Hackett.gif
[3:28:49] <%machshop> yeah this is like post-game DLC
[3:28:54] <%mikeriffic> Soooo this is suppose to come AFTER the main game but in LE it comes whenever and cant be avoided....DO NOT DO THIS DLC UNTIL THE END
[3:28:54] <peachy996> Arrival is where the writing takes a noticeable dip in quality and a bad omen for ME3
[3:28:57] <aiutare47> This DLC is what makes 10% of ME3 make sense, its supposed to be a prologue to me3
[3:28:58] <jackelzxaa> hackett is so decent
[3:28:59] <%Puffen0> "Possible reaper invasion. Send one person"
[3:29:00] <%mikeriffic> IT doesnt make sense timeline wise

[3:29:33] <jackelzxaa> "Hackett, how many Batarians do I get to kill on this mission?"
[3:29:34] <%Faustgesicht> This is super post-game. didn't this come out like 2months before ME3?
[3:29:35] <crazy_riggs> It wasn't for this specifically...
[3:29:36] <AmuserName> VANGUARD CHARGING INTO SPACE KOREA DISCRETELY, CAN'T BRING YOUR STEALTH-THIEF FRIEND

[3:30:21] <%Cykron> Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?
[3:30:21] <GustauveVIII> its not really genocide when you dont plan to kill all the batarians
[3:30:21] <%kyh9> Almost!  All of them
[3:30:21] <%jillpilled> That shouldn't be a war crime though, those Batarians did nothing right

[3:32:42] <James_Quivers> ESPECIALLY NTO PAT
[3:32:42] <%JoshManVGH> We appreciate all the work you do for tge stream, Pat.
[3:32:43] <jackelzxaa> kasumi will comment on your romance option
[3:32:45] <%kyh9> That Aria is voiced by Trinity is kind of hot
[3:32:46] <Samurai_Tchan> you drank the space booze already
[3:32:50] <Zalapski> RUB IT IN WHY DONTCHA
[3:32:52] <$RealThiele> big creeper
[3:32:53] <+PenmanLupine> did you get Solus yet?
[3:32:55] <peachy996> She doesn't say much
[3:33:02] <@commanderclaw> Have a less spicy butthole
[3:33:03] <%machshop> this is my favorite stream on the citadel
[3:33:04] <%JoshManVGH> Aww
[3:33:05] <%walternatorz> literally
[3:33:06] <%shadowsofpain> Go to her after every mission for new dialog
[3:33:06] <jackelzxaa> theres a small bit of things of note kasumi and zaeed comment on that aren't part of their normal dialog loops
[3:33:07] <derap41> big pants mes
[3:33:07] <intestinal_bleeding> people like messy pat
[3:33:09] <$RealThiele> like the toilet bowl
[3:33:09] <%Monkeyweed21> what about Miranda
[3:33:11] <LluthyY> Its the quality we deserve pat
[3:33:12] <%BarujaraciGaming> it's been fun as hell though
[3:33:12] <Profmcstevie> Blame that spice
[3:33:13] <peachy996> He ends up saying more since he's filled with stories
[3:33:14] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Seems like zaeed got more work
[3:33:14] <TourettesPlays> Taking 5 shits in 1 hour is a lot of work Pat
[3:33:15] <Samurai_Tchan> SHE DOES THAT IN ORDER TO KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM HER
[3:33:18] <reasonance> you can't do kasumi can you?
[3:33:23] <jackelzxaa> so it's worth going back every once in a while to see if they have anything new to say after they start looping
[3:33:27] <AmuserName> Why not spend his whole speech compressing garbage cubes?
[3:33:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Even Zaeed hates Slavers
[3:33:30] <%Puffen0> Kasumi is SOOOOO much creepier in ME3
[3:33:36] <%kyh9> LOVE ZAEEDS GRANDPA STORIES
[3:33:44] <%JoshManVGH> Does anyone know if you can date Kasumi in 3?
[3:33:55] <%mikeriffic> oh this convo
[3:33:57] <ingman112> You cannot
[3:33:57] <peachy996> You can tell Zaeed was earlier dlc by the amount of stories he has compared to Kasumi
[3:33:57] <TourettesPlays> This bit is great
[3:33:57] <bri8203> fecal fire
[3:33:58] <%kyh9> @JoshManVGH lol no

[3:34:22] <mcsassafras> f those turians grunt
[3:34:23] <jackelzxaa> ambient dialog stuff you can miss: the engineers will comment on stuff as you walk by, and the break room by the bathrooms have a couple of crewmen who comment about collector invasions that are happening elsewhere
[3:34:26] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Sure man
[3:34:32] <%kyh9> I get it
[3:34:32] <QuestlordJake> O-okay....
[3:34:35] <Ranger747> thanks
[3:34:38] <%JoshManVGH> Yeesh
[3:34:41] <JetpackMcQuack> That's not nice, Grunt
[3:34:46] <+Ghufufin> no body likes their head parts messed with
[3:34:47] <jackelzxaa> remember when grunt never stops being racist towards turians, but he's cute at least.
[3:34:51] <peachy996> Scalping is a fun wartime activity in Space
[3:34:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Justified
[3:34:56] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> People hate getting scalped
[3:34:57] <mcsassafras> death to all dem turries
[3:35:01] <+MrAtheGreat> I mean Grunt’d probably want to tear a krogan head plate off too if you’d left him.

[3:35:42] <%NopeBadguy> RACIST CHILD
[3:35:42] <someyounguy1> part of grunts humanization is realizing hes racist
[3:35:43] <+Punchasaur> he's a genetically perfect manchild made for space murder
[3:35:44] <mak0t0yukii> RACISM UNLOCK
[3:35:45] <+Ghufufin> Grunt: Yay i figured out Im racist
[3:35:46] <jackelzxaa> grunt never apologizes for being racist
[3:35:47] <%The_Review_Corps> EVERYBODY'S RACIST!!!
[3:35:47] <$RealThiele> bad reasons
[3:35:50] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> This is when you lock the door 9m your way out
[3:35:53] <aiutare47> I fuck Turians though
[3:35:55] <peachy996> He ends up saying "Garrus is okay cuz he's on your team"
[3:35:57] <Goraka91> ''He's one of the good ones''
[3:35:59] <jackelzxaa> if you ask him about garrus he says he doesn't hate him because he's just one turian
[3:36:00] <SilasDrekken> the illusion of choice
[3:36:00] <+GuilKato> Grunt we could never stop visiting you
[3:36:00] <Dunmarkh> "garrus is one of the good ones"
[3:36:01] <%Puffen0> bad reasons
[3:36:04] <+Cactuskris> rasicm unlocked
[3:36:04] <peachy996> That was the renegade option
[3:36:04] <%ape_hawk> somewhere, ashleys corpse gets wet
[3:36:04] <%miguelrod777> your child is becoming a racist
[3:36:05] <$RealThiele> "garrus is one of the good ones"
[3:36:07] <sekihoe> woooow, this game's script is sooooo gud
[3:36:08] <$RealThiele> shit
[3:36:09] <%kyh9> OH YEAH
[3:36:09] <%afronooch> nah. he says "Garrus is cool, but fuck turians"
[3:36:13] <mcsassafras> i hate turries bigotry achievement unlocked
[3:36:13] <%ItalianWaifu> Man Krogans would fucking love Warhammer wouldn't they
[3:36:15] <peachy996> They do
[3:36:15] <tankspank5050> Turians are the ones who fought them so it hurts more
[3:36:17] <ioci2112> the salarians didn't want to use it, but turians insisted on deploying it
[3:36:18] <%shadowsofpain> The salarians didn't use it
[3:36:18] <%machshop> they see the turians more i guess
[3:36:19] <Goraka91> Turians asked the Salarians to make it I think?
[3:36:19] <ScreamLord> Salarians made it, Turians used it
[3:36:19] <%bread_assassin> Salarians just made it as a deterrent.
[3:36:19] <+MrAtheGreat> Nah if you say what about Garrus Shepard goes “DONG START SHIT ON MY SHIP” and Grunt says Yes sir I wont
[3:36:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Because the salarians don't fight face to face
[3:36:21] <StevenNewJersey> Salarians? no, it was Dolphin and Whale
[3:36:22] <mak0t0yukii> WELL I HATE GARRUS TOO BUT IN A GOOD WAY
[3:36:22] <peachy996> They just alternate their hatred
[3:36:22] <%kyh9> AND NOT THE SALARIANS
[3:36:22] <%Jeemukun> Salarians made, Turians deployed it
[3:36:22] <aiutare47> Turians fought them head to head
[3:36:22] <NeroInfinite> The salrians cooked it up but the turians deployed it
[3:36:23] <knight_verse> Krogan are genetically racist, but they will still respect you if you are a badass.
[3:36:23] <%RetroCop87> The solarians also didn't expect the Turians to actually use it
[3:36:25] <James_Quivers> Salarians are too weak, wouldn't put up a good fight
[3:36:25] <+D00msDayDan> yeah but the turians beat them in battle and that wounded their honor
[3:36:26] <%Maids4lyfe> bad writing
[3:36:27] <williamrooster> they hate salarians too
[3:36:29] <+FelIian> Turians deployed it
[3:36:30] <+GuilKato> Pirate Queen!
[3:36:30] <Symmy_> easier to be pissed about the dudes who were actually pjysically there
[3:36:32] <%Monkeyweed21> the Turians were the ones they actually fought
[3:36:32] <jackelzxaa> pat do you know about the postgame romance glitch that lets you see all 3 paramour scenes?
[3:36:32] <%kyh9> Krogans can't process that they lost an indirect war
[3:36:33] <+Pequod1> turians can fight salarians wont
[3:36:33] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I think the logic is that the Krogan expect the worst from Salarians because they're clever, but Turians are more like them in comparison
[3:36:38] <%maskedsongbird> It's because the Salarians made the genophage, but it was the Turians who actually put it to use.
[3:36:39] <logothete2401> Like ninty percent of the Krogan's misery is the Salarians fault.
[3:36:39] <ingman112> They reaaaaally hate salarians
[3:36:41] <+kekkerscrew> Because Salarians aren't worth hating
[3:36:42] <%Puffen0> @patstaresat in me3 you find out the turins released the genophage without the permission of ANYBODY
[3:36:43] <%BarujaraciGaming> doesn't that hatred shift to the salarians in 3?
[3:36:47] <+PenmanLupine> don't do it
[3:36:47] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Does grunt ever confront mordin about the genophage?
[3:36:49] <%JoshManVGH> This costume is so much better.
[3:36:50] <$SGrim> Conceptualization [Easy] - Subscribe to Grunt's advanced race theory.
[3:36:50] <%kyh9> Krogans literally don't think of war in indirect terms.
[3:36:51] <intestinal_bleeding> oh no not that
[3:36:51] <+MightyDuckShoes> Shepard made the NUT face
[3:36:55] <ingman112> They hate em both
[3:36:58] <$lumporr> SHE'S GONNA LEAP FOR YOUR DICK, IT'S A QTE WATCH OUT
[3:36:59] <HaroldDonchee> the salarians were just contracted by the turians. Krogans understand being paid to fuck somebody up
[3:36:59] <%walternatorz> where those rape gangs?
[3:37:01] <+GingerStrawhat> Screw the puss to complete the character arc!
[3:37:03] <%maskedsongbird> To be fair though, the Krogan do hate the Salarians, too.
[3:37:05] <$RealThiele> tell me about your cool shades
[3:37:13] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking Shadowrun character up in space
[3:37:17] <mcsassafras> off to fight scine turians can't with diplomats instead of a krant
[3:37:18] <%shurtal> Turians beat them with a weapon for cowards, making them shitty @patstaresat
[3:37:25] <+HelloImTom08> I really like Jack's alt outfit
[3:37:26] <peachy996> @mybigmeech they were gonna do that but it was cut out, the audio files are still there

[3:40:30] <SpaceGuntank> is woolie's back still fucked?
[3:40:31] <%maskedsongbird> I honestly really hate how there's no platonic way to resolve Jack's plotline. It's either you romance her and she loves you, turn her down and she hates you, or screw her and she hates you. It's honestly kind of irritating.
[3:40:32] <%ExpressNode> Yay my day off
[3:40:33] <jackelzxaa> me2 is really good at not letting you accidentally romance people, they have real strict "conflict moments"

[3:42:33] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt On the IFF
[3:42:34] <jackelzxaa> reaper iff is where you get legion

[3:42:39] <TourettesPlays> I mean she still has massive ass and tiddee so it's literally no difference
[3:42:39] <+GingerStrawhat> It's on the way to the Reaper IFF
[3:42:40] <+RyanTheRecluse> on the reaper ship
[3:42:42] <peachy996> You meet him on the IFF
[3:42:43] <$Futurecity10> Legion dialouge is basically post game
[3:42:46] <%charp35> iff is where you get him
[3:42:48] <%The_Review_Corps> yeah im up to that now and feel the same :(
[3:42:49] <AmuserName> IFF. Cool to save Tali loyalty ONLY for POST-IFF.
[3:42:50] <%Mattais88> It really sucks
[3:42:54] <%Garthunox> IFF
[3:42:55] <%JoshManVGH> You have 2 missions before the collectors attack I think
[3:42:56] <jackelzxaa> if you bring jack on miranda's mission there's a unique scene before the boss
[3:43:00] <+FelIian> Legion is SUPER late
[3:43:00] <mcsassafras> you have two missions afterwards before umm
[3:43:01] <%Ravioli_Ronin> No one should be showing up after the reaper IFF
[3:43:02] <jackelzxaa> a minor one but its worth a chuckle
[3:43:06] <Broken_Sonex> IT'S NOT STUPID
[3:43:12] <%DracosMagala> Its a nice ass tho thickSMILE
[3:43:18] <+trackles_64> He gonna regret that in ME3
[3:43:19] <%The_Review_Corps> considering legion was supposed to be one of the first you get it pisses me off hes buried so late in the game
[3:43:39] <RushUnplugged> that version would have been so cool
[3:43:48] <peachy996> Billy?!
[3:43:49] <+BusterRepukken> quirky dialogue
[3:43:59] <%BarujaraciGaming> I'm going to go through Microsoft refund process for this trilogy, select "the game doesn't work", and write "NO ASS" in the description

[3:44:08] <Symmy_> did this ever go anywhere?
[3:44:08] <%maskedsongbird> Hmmmm....don't like that
[3:44:09] <Dunmarkh> BIMMY?
[3:44:09] <peachy996> OHNO IT WAS BILLY ALL ALONG
[3:44:10] <jackelzxaa> Pat did you ever accidentally lose anyone on the suicide mission or did you figure out the best choices your first time?
[3:44:10] <KohryuZX> This fucking mail goes NOWHERE
[3:44:11] <tattleworm> bimmy
[3:44:14] <%cvp5127> damaged
[3:44:17] <%JoshManVGH> Wait, who did you shoot at that you didn't definitively kill?
[3:44:17] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@YakumoYomi) (warning)
[3:44:19] <%maskedsongbird> @BarujaraciGaming Based
[3:44:19] <%jillpilled> This never comes up again in ME3 fairly sure lol
[3:44:26] <jackelzxaa> this is a spoiler for liara lol
[3:44:27] <%Puffen0> spbO1 spbO2 spbO3
[3:44:27] <$lumporr> @KohryuZX i mean to be fair he probably dies
[3:44:30] <jackelzxaa> you haven't even met her yet
[3:44:30] <AmuserName> B O R K E R
[3:44:40] <%Ranryu692> don't do that until you've done Liara's regular quests
[3:44:42] <peachy996> Get your ass to Illium
[3:44:43] <%DashXero> What's Billy's deal? Why is he sending these messages?
[3:44:43] <TourettesPlays> We're aware that Liara got her walls blown out by the shadow broker
[3:44:46] <Dunmarkh> dick down that blussy for mankind
[3:44:51] <blackjack8182> Do Liara’s sidequest first
[3:44:56] <%Puffen0> thechiefW thechiefW thechiefW
[3:44:57] <%BarujaraciGaming> @maskedsongbird it's the only right thing to do at this point
[3:44:58] <Wolfstriker121> so lore wise....shadow broker is before overlord dlc or after?
[3:45:02] <peachy996> Or run to Tali
[3:45:04] <%Dfreddy8> TALI
[3:45:08] <jackelzxaa> liara has an accidentally trigger the dlc dialog in her wheel, it's one of her bottom rights where you say "i have shadow broker info lol"
[3:45:08] <James_Quivers> I like to do Lair in the PostGame
[3:45:14] <+trackles_64> bad ui
[3:45:18] <jackelzxaa> i believe its bottom right
[3:45:18] <williamrooster> I would say shadow broker is also post game
[3:45:19] <%ExpressNode> God I love wallpaper engine
[3:45:19] <Pookiedaexzile> And we don't even have Blue Mommy Milkers yet
[3:45:20] <%maskedsongbird> I actually had to look up a 2010 vs 2021 comparison because I wasn't sure if they actually changed Miranda's scene and they actually did. That's hilarious.
[3:45:21] <$RealThiele> so would blussy sound like Bloosee or Blussee?
[3:45:21] <peachy996> Tali is faster to get than Samara or Thane
[3:45:23] <TourettesPlays> Its best to do Shadow broker when you hit level cap so you can have a maxed out Liara
[3:45:23] <%JoshManVGH> Tali has cool submachine gun.
[3:45:25] <$Solid_Stro> Tali’s hips need you
[3:45:27] <%BarujaraciGaming> oh. I haven't done this yet.....
[3:45:31] <%XzileGaming> Jesus Lord Lvl. 93
[3:45:31] <blackjack8182> You haven’t even met her
[3:45:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Or Big Little Green
[3:45:36] <$lumporr> when we gon' pick up TALI and get somma dat sweet PLUSSY

[3:45:50] <peachy996> Yeah and Tali is fast enough you can close the night out with
[3:45:50] <$lumporr> purple pussy?
[3:45:52] <%JoshManVGH> Except Legion.
[3:45:54] <%ape_hawk> GET THAT QUSSY
[3:45:55] <$lumporr> purplussy?
[3:45:57] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Time to get Tali.
[3:45:58] <jackelzxaa> tali tali tali tali
[3:46:02] <$lumporr> qussy
[3:46:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Its Qurussy
[3:46:05] <TourettesPlays> Not saving Tali and legion for last for unique dialogue?
[3:46:06] <Pookiedaexzile> For the last time
[3:46:08] <jackelzxaa> bring tali to watch you kiss liara
[3:46:09] <%Puffen0> GET THAT QUSSY
[3:46:15] <%maenos2> OH BOY TIME TO GO OT THE DROPPED PLOT POINT PLANET
[3:46:17] <stantheman_97> quarussy
[3:46:19] <$Solid_Stro> Can the Normandy hold both Tali and her hips onboard?
[3:46:20] <+TrevSmith222> Basically everything before the IFF.
[3:46:21] <$RealThiele> dolan plz
[3:46:22] <Goraka91> @maskedsongbird To be fair it it rather gratuitous, she's asking for help and the game is like ''lol look at her ass''
[3:46:24] <+trackles_64> did he mine the universe chat?
[3:46:30] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt If you want the Geth Rifle bump the difficulty up to Hardcore first
[3:46:31] <%BarujaraciGaming> holdenHO holdenHO holdenHO holdenHO holdenHO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenOO holdenBUSTIN holdenBUSTIN holdenBUSTIN holdenBUSTIN
[3:46:32] <%maskedsongbird> @Dunmarkh Does everybody get shades with a weird new alt costume now?
[3:46:35] <peachy996> Tali will shoot him but that's not worth the risk
[3:46:36] <artoflec> what is in the gooby galaxy pat
[3:46:42] <ScreamLord> Before you start the mission
[3:46:47] <TourettesPlays> lmao the quarian SHIT when you bring a geth on the flotilla its so funny
[3:46:47] <jackelzxaa> if you're okay with letting the crew die you can get legion right away and have a ton of robot fun, but that's a pretty steep price for being friends with a robot
[3:46:47] <$lumporr> looking at "qussy" typed out feels wrong
[3:46:58] <%JoshManVGH> It's the loyalty missions you save. if there's unique dialog for her pickup mission that's
[3:47:00] <AmuserName> The best experience in the series is doing Tali's loyalty mission with Legion, then Legion's mission with Tali, BACK TO BACK.
[3:47:03] <%BarujaraciGaming> psaBig holdenHO
[3:47:03] <%Piemono> Pat knows about the point system to get the good Geth-Quarian ending in ME 3 right?
[3:47:04] <%JoshManVGH> a lot of work
[3:47:05] <+chester804> no Tali romance then?
[3:47:07] <$RealThiele> jpeg-ass galaxy
[3:47:09] <jackelzxaa> pat in an earlier stream you mentioned you thought the galaxy map was rotated, but it wasn't, every cluster stays in the same location the entire trilogy
[3:47:11] <TourettesPlays> @jackelzxaa Kelly Chambers > > > > Everyone else
[3:47:11] <%maskedsongbird> @Goraka91 Oh for sure, it's definitely an improvement to the scene as it's easier to take seriously now. Doesn't make it not funny, though. LUL
[3:47:15] <%Puffen0> I once saw someone say that Tali was a grade a quarian butt slut lol
[3:47:18] <Dunmarkh> @Dunmarkh yes
[3:47:28] <T_Sasquatch> @tourettesplays you can do that ???
[3:47:28] <$Futurecity10> No
[3:47:29] <tattleworm> some are never signposted, i think
[3:47:32] <$Futurecity10> You have to scan the planets
[3:47:34] <%Mattais88> Nah it's just showing the route you take to get there
[3:47:34] <jackelzxaa> no you dont get those kinds of unc missions anymore
[3:47:35] <RushUnplugged> most planets are just the mission
[3:47:37] <%JoshManVGH> you gotta scan planets
[3:47:39] <jackelzxaa> all of them are anomolies now
[3:47:40] <%BarujaraciGaming> lol what
[3:47:40] <williamrooster> you have to scan the planet
[3:47:40] <+Memequisition> i think you have to specifically stop in the system and scan the planets
[3:47:42] <supergoblinpunch> Start scanning
[3:47:45] <LluthyY> yea have to scan first
[3:47:48] <peachy996> Scan Anomaly Planet, Go to Location
[3:47:49] <%BarujaraciGaming> oh
[3:47:49] <jackelzxaa> except for one or two that you get from other missions
[3:47:50] <+D00msDayDan> you get the "hey motherfucker" when you scan the planet and see a anomaly or signal
[3:47:53] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt If you want the Geth Rifle bump the difficulty up to Hardcore before you go to Heastrom
[3:48:00] <knight_verse> YEP, THERE'S AT LEAST ONE PER SYSTEM
[3:48:00] <%Puffen0> YEAHHHH
[3:48:02] <%weissguard> Yeah, some planets will just have EDI say "Anomaly Detected"
[3:48:05] <jackelzxaa> hardcore is actually not that hard
[3:48:09] <jackelzxaa> insanity is the stupid one
[3:48:14] <jackelzxaa> but hardcore is pretty well balanced
[3:48:15] <mcsassafras> some are omni directional other are not.
[3:48:15] <peachy996> It will at least tell you what is and isn't an Anomaly Planet
[3:48:25] <GrimAngel01> nearly every system will have a scanable mission but not every region in each section will have one so you have to deep search
[3:48:25] <$RealThiele> ZA
[3:48:26] <+GuilKato> are you going to leave overlord + tali to when you have legion
[3:48:30] <jackelzxaa> you have to change your difficulty before you land though
[3:48:42] <jackelzxaa> so change now then do the mission and you'll get it
[3:48:44] <tattleworm> you can kick it up just for this mission if you want it
[3:48:46] <jackelzxaa> don't change on the planet
[3:48:47] <$RealThiele> WARUDO
[3:48:52] <peachy996> It's not that great of a weapon but you can still get it
[3:48:53] <+GuilKato> because taking legion to Overlord is amusing @PatStaresAt or I thought it was
[3:49:03] <peachy996> Oh well nvm
[3:49:03] <ScreamLord> Now you don't get it
[3:49:09] <%maskedsongbird> Charging is bad here, mmkay?
[3:49:13] <jackelzxaa> its a very minor change from the collector assault rifle
[3:49:16] <Dunmarkh> Jack
[3:49:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Son
[3:49:17] <%Puffen0> @jackelzxaa insanity is like they just made the enemies do 500× damage and you only do 50× damage if that
[3:49:21] <%Puffen0> JACK
[3:49:22] <nuane> jack
[3:49:22] <jackelzxaa> but i like giving the geth pulse rifle to legion
[3:49:23] <%JoshManVGH> Grunt is immune to sun stuff I think
[3:49:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack or Son
[3:49:24] <mcsassafras> Garry's fu....I guess turrie
[3:49:25] <murdocismyhero> the old man!!
[3:49:27] <%Dfreddy8> Probably Mordin
[3:49:29] <jackelzxaa> yeah, insanity is stupid in the first 2 games
[3:49:33] <Dunmarkh> gunt
[3:49:35] <%Puffen0> jack for life
[3:49:37] <%maskedsongbird> Someone that can take out shields.
[3:49:44] <jackelzxaa> insanity is fine in 3 but in LE1 and 2 hardcore is sweet spot for me
[3:49:44] <peachy996> Grunt has a line
[3:49:45] <%JoshManVGH> Mordin is always entertaining though
[3:49:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Grunt
[3:49:46] <%BarujaraciGaming> jack
[3:49:49] <%PhantomMiG> Mordin for the science
[3:49:51] <peachy996> But Incinerate helps
[3:49:51] <%maskedsongbird> Mordin's a good choice because Incinerate too.
[3:49:52] <%YakumoYomi> I take Grunt whenever I can
[3:49:52] <%Dfreddy8> Mordin for Incinerate
[3:49:54] <mcsassafras> im kidding Gary's my boi
[3:49:55] <%AzureGale> Poll tiem
[3:49:55] <Dunmarkh> grant
[3:49:58] <peachy996> But Grunt is tankier
[3:49:58] <jackelzxaa> grunt has a minor 300 reference in this mission
[3:50:00] <%BarujaraciGaming> Jack
[3:50:02] <willyfreshness> shame you only have 3 party members to choose from
[3:50:06] <jackelzxaa> where he says "then we fight in the shade" or something like that
[3:50:09] <%BarujaraciGaming> weak
[3:50:11] <%JoshManVGH> Not using Garrus cool armor?
[3:50:19] <TourettesPlays> Overload is so fucking good in 3 Pat just you wait
[3:50:22] <ingman112> Grunt’s actually a solid choice here due to the environment. He doesn’t have any shields
[3:50:23] <%maskedsongbird> Sehr gut
[3:50:23] <%MoguManda> genocider or gencidee
[3:50:26] <mcsassafras> guys guys they all are good
[3:50:34] <jackelzxaa> it's really weird that garrus's loyalty armor is just a second suit of armor that's broken the exact same way
[3:50:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Lets bring too cool heads
[3:50:38] <+GingerStrawhat> ALRIGHT LETS GO SEE THE ABANDONED PLOT THREADS FOR MASS EFFECT 3! WOOOO!
[3:50:44] <mcsassafras> except jacob
[3:50:45] <%JoshManVGH> That's a dumb bug
[3:50:47] <%CalderGaming> the last hurrah of the Good main plot
[3:50:48] <%Puffen0> dumb bug should have known better
[3:50:48] <$lumporr> why'd that bug do that
[3:50:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Too Temperate calm guys
[3:50:51] <tranquilturnip> you'd think it'd know not to do that
[3:50:53] <peachy996> You'd think the Bug would know about that
[3:50:55] <+RaveBV> stupid insect
[3:51:01] <jackelzxaa> i wonder if they just do the dark energy thing for mass effect 5
[3:51:05] <StevenNewJersey> helmets do nothing
[3:51:05] <$RealThiele> RIP tutorial bug
[3:51:07] <blackjack8182> Dumb bug
[3:51:08] <%AzureGale> Weather fx
[3:51:11] <jackelzxaa> since it's possibly hundreds of years later
[3:51:12] <LluthyY> noooo! bugo
[3:51:12] <peachy996> Ohh this is where the Drew Karpyshyn plot thread gets dropped
[3:51:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Better slather your head in sunscreen
[3:51:13] <thetunnelhomer> I guess this place has air.
[3:51:13] <%YakumoYomi> You're in the shade. It's fiiiiiine~
[3:51:14] <+D00msDayDan> i zoned out, did pat bump up the difficulty or does he not care about getting the geth AR?
[3:51:16] <%DashXero> The sheen of Sheperd's bald head reflects the rays.
[3:51:17] <Teechep> has best boi been acquired
[3:51:18] <nuane> she's exaggerating, the air is fine
[3:51:22] <%Puffen0> @jackelzxaa yeah I think the cannon reason is he just paints his old armor
[3:51:23] <+RaveBV> Then again, flies and bees will walk into sticky traps they see their buddies stuck in
[3:51:24] <%JoshManVGH> Your bald head can reflect the deadly sun rays
[3:51:33] <Latija> i sure hope there's not any DARK ENERGY here
[3:51:35] <%Puffen0> Your bald head can reflect the deadly sun rays
[3:51:40] <+D00msDayDan> they don't need line of sight either
[3:51:43] <%BarujaraciGaming> @dashxero real next gen ray tracing
[3:51:45] <peachy996> "Hey...threesome later?"
[3:51:52] <intestinal_bleeding> brum me out brah
[3:51:52] <StevenNewJersey> i loved being brummed out
[3:51:54] <Pookiedaexzile> A gun
[3:51:54] <jackelzxaa> that's a dying sun!
[3:51:56] <RushUnplugged> the REAL plot
[3:51:57] <%MidnightBurst12> nah but sure
[3:51:58] <%dekkitout> Something bad?
[3:51:58] <James_Quivers> DARK ENERGY
[3:51:59] <GustauveVIII> A FAILED PLOT DEVICE
[3:52:00] <Sol_Install> lense flare
[3:52:00] <StevenNewJersey> it's my mom
[3:52:00] <+PenmanLupine> the heat death of the universe?
[3:52:00] <%CalderGaming> YUP
[3:52:00] <%DashXero> @BarujaraciGaming Yeah!
[3:52:01] <%afronooch> abandoned plot
[3:52:01] <%walternatorz> the death of ME3
[3:52:01] <tattleworm> a half developed alternate plot
[3:52:02] <%JoshManVGH> An abandond storyline
[3:52:04] <peachy996> That is cancelled plot
[3:52:04] <%ape_hawk> its a dropped plot line
[3:52:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait what
[3:52:05] <gamingpenguin52> garrus and mordin were my go to groups!
[3:52:05] <%maenos2> DROPPED PLOT LINE
[3:52:05] <$RealThiele> normal sunlight
[3:52:05] <+PenmanLupine> oh....
[3:52:06] <+Memequisition> :(
[3:52:06] <%Faustgesicht> YUUUUUUUP
[3:52:07] <%MidnightBurst12> ???
[3:52:08] <%NateyBeak> explain
[3:52:08] <+D00msDayDan> a dropped plot thread
[3:52:09] <$lumporr> ?
[3:52:10] <%SinnerEbru> lmaoooo
[3:52:10] <%JohnAtDawn> ????????
[3:52:12] <NeroInfinite> yep
[3:52:13] <%machshop> damn
[3:52:13] <%dekkitout> Like literally?
[3:52:13] <jackelzxaa> they coulda fucked up dark energy too if drew wasn't there though
[3:52:13] <leinadtonu> J.J. Abrahams spirit?
[3:52:14] <stantheman_97> a plot point that goes no where
[3:52:14] <logothete2401> I actually disagree with that
[3:52:15] <+GingerStrawhat> Fucking Leaks
[3:52:15] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt what ending?
[3:52:15] <+MrAtheGreat> wut?
[3:52:16] <%YakumoYomi> My corneas being incinerated?
[3:52:16] <LluthyY> Ohh...
[3:52:18] <Goraka91> DARK ENERGY MOTHERFUCKER
[3:52:18] <%DashXero> I dun get it.
[3:52:18] <blackjack8182> The main plot
[3:52:19] <%JoshManVGH> A so much cooler central story!
[3:52:19] <%The_Review_Corps> DARK MATTER
[3:52:20] <%Faustgesicht> heat death of universe
[3:52:21] <+Memequisition> rpbreeCry
[3:52:23] <%Puffen0> says you lol. i like the me3 ending
[3:52:24] <supergoblinpunch> Dark energy
[3:52:25] <tattleworm> you've no idea if it'd be better, they barely put any work into it
[3:52:26] <$Solid_Stro> Oh God, don’t remind me doodOuch
[3:52:30] <ScreamLord> It's weird that the Geth Rifle has a difficulty lock when none of the other do
[3:52:30] <falyden> Dark Energy plot by Drew
[3:52:30] <%DashXero> Oh wow. That's a bummer.
[3:52:31] <%JohnAtDawn> oh right dark energy
[3:52:32] <%JoshManVGH> So dose Illium!
[3:52:37] <TourettesPlays> Pat dark matter plotline is just a hamfisted environmentalist message
[3:52:40] <+GingerStrawhat> They Dropped it cause it leaked out and EA was like CHANGE IT!!
[3:52:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Because A.I. was such a big element
[3:52:43] <blackjack8182> It was too smart for EA Bioware
[3:52:45] <%BarujaraciGaming> the fuuuuuuuuck are you serious.....
[3:52:45] <%Garthunox> @Puffen0 calm down dude
[3:52:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Not Spacism
[3:52:50] <$Solid_Stro> This is depressing as fuck
[3:52:53] <Sp3ctre48> We don't know if it would've been better tbh, could've been just as bad as what we got
[3:52:58] <Pookiedaexzile> This dude
[3:52:58] <intestinal_bleeding> environment bad
[3:52:58] <%JoshManVGH> Gianna Parasinii also talks about it on Illium
[3:53:01] <jackelzxaa> the reason mass effect 3's ending was shitted up is because casey hudson didnt want the rest of the team involved in the ending and only let mac walters write it with him in a locked room.  It's why the rannoch plotline in me3 has direct contradictions with it
[3:53:03] <LockingKey> they got real butthurt that people guessed the ending, so they changed it to surprise people
[3:53:04] <peachy996> @TourettesPlays It's still better than AI bad
[3:53:05] <%Puffen0> @garthunox i will not Kappa
[3:53:06] <tranquilturnip> ham is better than garbage
[3:53:06] <+PenmanLupine> I gotta say, if Mordin didn't have his charm, he'd be the most insufferable character in ME
[3:53:09] <%ape_hawk> if anything, the message wouldve been more important TODAY
[3:53:11] <%maenos2> its a lot fucking better than "the created turn against their creators." "but i brokered peace with teh geth and quarians" "no shut up"
[3:53:12] <+GingerStrawhat> At least it's built up to a lot more then the star child ever was
[3:53:13] <James_Quivers> I think they're gonna pick it up for ME4, no reason not to
[3:53:13] <jackelzxaa> they could have smoothed over the theming if casey hudson wasn't a fucking idiot
[3:53:13] <intestinal_bleeding> i don't like politics in my space politics games >:[
[3:53:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Like ME3 wasn't already HamFistted
[3:53:15] <CrypticMochi> Still would have been better
[3:53:17] <Profmcstevie> It would have been a well established hokey environmentalist message
[3:53:19] <+Goliz> When a hamfisted environmentalist is more exciting than the real ending... Sadge
[3:53:20] <leinadtonu> Never heard about that, I'm curious now.
[3:53:25] <%Garthunox> @Puffen0 enjoy being wrong then
[3:53:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no Not Eviromentalism
[3:53:33] <blackjack8182> Would of been better
[3:53:35] <%Garthunox> Kee'lah Se'lai
[3:53:38] <Pookiedaexzile> How dare they
[3:53:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Geeth
[3:53:39] <Goraka91> @jackelzxaa Nuh uh but robots bad
[3:53:44] <ioci2112> so the reapers are just eco fascists then?
[3:53:47] <+MrAtheGreat> Mordin: "Enjoy" :D
[3:53:52] <logothete2401> I think they were right to change it, but wrong with what they replaced it with
[3:53:55] <RushUnplugged> people guessed it and he threw a fit and made a new ending in 3 days
[3:53:56] <+FelIian> you know they were very close to not making Tali a full party member in ME3, and that's fucked
[3:53:56] <%hrbeck_> >TFW environment
[3:53:56] <%weissguard> I didn't realize how much I missed the Geth until I started seeing them again.
[3:53:58] <%Faustgesicht> yo tali's theme is so good
[3:54:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> how about it's just repetitive to have the Geth Quarian plot be the exact same as the Reaper plot and completely invalidates how you handle those separate arcs?
[3:54:01] <+Goliz> Like, literally anything would be better
[3:54:07] <+MrAtheGreat> Geth're shooting at the walls they must be bugging outs
[3:54:08] <%Ravioli_Ronin> They really gave us two “roBoTs bAhd” plot lines in the same game
[3:54:08] <$Solid_Stro> Time to Kee’lah Bitch sabert14Gun
[3:54:11] <ScreamLord> Basically Mass Effect Tech speeds up the Heat Death of the Universe and the Reapers are harvesting advanced life to slow it down and hopefully find a solution because immortality doesn't matter if the universe implodes/explodes/fizzles out
[3:54:12] <jackelzxaa> if you get the bad ending on rannoch it would perfectly support the me3 ending but that's like...the only way to see a situation where the geth take an absolute solution to a problem that results in genocide
[3:54:13] <+Goliz> A sudden dark screen and credits
[3:54:13] <$lumporr> quarians prolly have like, horse faces
[3:54:16] <intestinal_bleeding> robot bideal giraff
[3:54:18] <Goraka91> Geth are fucking great
[3:54:19] <%Puffen0> @garthunox Kappa means sarcasm. and I can still like things that others don't. it all comes down to personal taste esfandL esfandL
[3:54:19] <+D00msDayDan> they're pretty good robots
[3:54:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Writers need less power in general
[3:54:25] <$realm_forge> Hey look it’s Jeff the geff
[3:54:32] <blackjack8182> Aren’t the White Walkers also and enviromentalist message.
[3:54:38] <tranquilturnip> it was a smart choice making them a robot race made by another non human race
[3:54:41] <%Garthunox> @Puffen0 woah no way
[3:54:42] <%dekkitout> @ScreamLord So Getter Rays/Spiral Energy- again
[3:54:43] <+D00msDayDan> it's so weird seeing this mission played on not hardcore
[3:54:49] <jackelzxaa> if the whole team had been working on the ending it would have been mostly fine, but casey was a moron who thought he had a perfect vision
[3:54:52] <TourettesPlays> @ScreamLord but muh countless cycles
[3:54:55] <$RealThiele> that sounds like what happens in star control 3 LUL
[3:54:55] <monkeyp0wer> I remember watching my cousin play all the Mass Effect games now I get to watch my favorite streamer play these games.
[3:54:58] <+FelIian> the ai shit just comes out of nowhere, Leviathan DLC helps but that was after the fact to deal with issues people had
[3:55:03] <+D00msDayDan> @Garthunox @Puffen0 can you two, like, take it to DMs or something
[3:55:05] <ScreamLord> @dekkitout Kinda yeah
[3:55:06] <+Punchasaur> bad personal taste LUL
[3:55:16] <%DashXero> They didn't want to get in the way.
[3:55:19] <%Puffen0> @garthunox i didn't mean to upset you. sorry man
[3:55:20] <Goraka91> @jackelzxaa You don't understand, it's the very deep very original plotline of ''AI bad''
[3:55:23] <Pookiedaexzile> No one man should have all that power
[3:55:27] <%Monkeyweed21> wait what planet is this again?
[3:55:35] <intestinal_bleeding> well this is just me going outside
[3:55:44] <ScreamLord> In the Dark Matter plot the Reapers are actually the good guys. Kinda
[3:55:45] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt AI is bad ending we got is so bad that Star Trek: Picard is using it
[3:55:53] <Goraka91> WutFace Natural light
[3:55:53] <intestinal_bleeding> @PatStaresAt i don't like the sun >:{
[3:55:55] <$Futurecity10> maxed tech armour makes this mechanic almost nonexistence
[3:55:59] <intestinal_bleeding> let's be shut ins forever
[3:55:59] <akitanito> the lighting doesn't really do a good job of showing the danger
[3:56:00] <%maskedsongbird> I live in Arizona. It's actually like this right now.
[3:56:01] <tattleworm> like 6 different kinds of warning beeps
[3:56:02] <+RowenCleric> Pat Shepard gonna have a wicked bald spot sunburn
[3:56:02] <jackelzxaa> that's the thing, you can easily work the rachni into that same solution too, there's things you can do to it to make it more appropriate
[3:56:03] <balthazar758> beep
[3:56:06] <Profmcstevie> Wait....if the mass effect tech speeds up the heat death of the universe, and the Reapers are the ones who made them.....why do they keep them
[3:56:11] <%Mattais88> Legendary Edition is the first time I didn't nuke the Collosus in this mission
[3:56:14] <%DashXero> Wait. Wut?
[3:56:15] <%NateyBeak> SAME ENDING
[3:56:17] <Sp3ctre48> NotLikeThis
[3:56:22] <lazuli_alter> catJAM
[3:56:25] <%maskedsongbird> Like, when people walk outside where I live, if you don't have water, you WILL die.
[3:56:26] <Goraka91> Picard is straight up fucking ME3 and it's embarrassing, even the last Star Wars copied it with the fleet
[3:56:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait Star Trek Ripped Mass Effect off BACK
[3:56:30] <peachy996> Hack Writers love the same hack schlock
[3:56:30] <+Punchasaur> i too saw that  rlm video
[3:56:31] <%Faustgesicht> Actually same ending
[3:56:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no
[3:56:33] <Samurai_Tchan> they should all be wearing helmets
[3:56:37] <+Dradugun> When watching Picard it screamed Mass Effect endings
[3:56:40] <$Solid_Stro> Does Picard get to choose a color though? sabert14Sip
[3:56:40] <%DashXero> Was Star Trek: Picard worth watching?
[3:56:40] <Sp3ctre48> Sucks that he's not exaggerating at all
[3:56:42] <%NateyBeak> @PatStaresAt atleast sheperd doesnt use a soccer ball bomb to stop the reapers
[3:56:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Wait which mission did pat pick is this the Tali one?
[3:56:55] <%maskedsongbird> Yes
[3:56:57] <%JoshManVGH> I don't understand why Biotic shields beep. I always assumed they were the result of the users concentration.
[3:56:59] <+Dradugun> @DashXero Not really
[3:56:59] <ScreamLord> yes
[3:57:00] <jackelzxaa> the idea of an overwhelming force that can destroy the galaxy permanently needing a god species to "leash it" is possible to work in well but they needed to do more work on it
[3:57:07] <Goraka91> @DashXero It's not Star Trek in any way, it's full of blood and gore and character assassination
[3:57:08] <%NateyBeak> @DashXero only if you want paint
[3:57:12] <%NateyBeak> pain*
[3:57:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Wow
[3:57:23] <jackelzxaa> the concept is underdeveloped is the biggest problem with it, but more tech writers and more team members on it could have brought it up
[3:57:23] <James_Quivers> THIS HURTS YOU
[3:57:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Anyone else see that
[3:57:27] <stormhawk9891> blind
[3:57:27] <%DashXero> I'm gonna take those responses as a "no."
[3:57:28] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat You ran past
[3:57:32] <jackelzxaa> yeah the sun can't kill you
[3:57:33] <ScreamLord> @JoshManVGH They are, this is a balancing thing
[3:57:33] <%AzureGale> Literally taking fire

[3:57:48] <%Puffen0> throughout all of 3 the reapers are trying to indoctrinated Shepard, everything with the star child is inside Shepards head while he's knocked out the final choice is whether or not Shepard accepts the reapers. blue is what illusive man wants, leading him to just be indoctrinated. green is what saren wanted which also lead to him being indoctrinated. red is EXACTLY what you've been fighting for the whole game, the destruction of the reapers.
[3:57:50] <$RealThiele> fuckin wat

[3:58:10] <+MightyDuckShoes> @profmcstevie It's Biotics. Some species get Biotics naturally. Basically the way psychic powers work I. ME causes corrosion to reality. So the mass relays are there because it would attract intelligent life at the first phase or just before gaining psycho powers.

[4:01:16] <bri8203> a barky dog in a barky gang
[4:01:17] <%maskedsongbird> TIME TO BRIBE THE PUPPER WITH TREATS
[4:01:19] <@PeachSaliva> @pookiedaexzile definitely ghost
[4:01:21] <%YakumoYomi> Gief wants to use his "final shot". He's just sitting on that meter!
[4:01:32] <+FelIian> @YakumoYomi that was a theory before the extended cut got released, which completely killed the indoctrination theory
[4:01:33] <%weissguard> gief big good boy psaDogchamp
[4:01:38] <stormhawk9891> Yup
[4:01:43] <%Ranryu692> yeah but it still sucks
[4:01:44] <%JoshManVGH> It's a full auto
[4:01:46] <akitanito> fight the dog for attention
[4:01:47] <+Punchasaur> he senses paige's ambient anxiety
[4:01:49] <+MrAtheGreat> it real good iirc
[4:01:53] <%Puffen0> @yakumoyomi yeah. cause Saren wants to work with the reapers in one. synthesis. and the illusive man wants to control them, just like what Javik says some of his fallen people wanted to do. in both situations they lead to indoctrinated people
[4:01:54] <peachy996> Fuckin love Kal'Reegar. This guy is the best and his armor is boss
[4:01:57] <jackelzxaa> tempest is a different kind of gun
[4:01:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Shits Haunted man, better sell now
[4:02:02] <AmuserName> Not raw, but overall better. No longer burst, less accurate, more ammo.
[4:02:02] <+pally_din> Accuracy is rough but yeah it's good
[4:02:04] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah
[4:02:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Now its a Smg
[4:02:06] <stormhawk9891> Still can't hit shit tho
[4:02:06] <StevenNewJersey> with 3 d's for a triple dose of pimping

[4:02:14] <%Maids4lyfe> nice
[4:02:17] <jackelzxaa> in me2 the guns fire differently which occasionally means the second tier isn't just a total upgrade
[4:02:19] <+FelIian> they did Kal'Reegar dirty in 3
[4:02:23] <%BarujaraciGaming> Holy shit I can't believe it's already 8pm
[4:02:24] <Goraka91> Also putting it out there, the Indoctrination Theory is fucking dumb and just sad fans clutching at straws
[4:02:24] <%Puffen0> @robuttastic after

[4:04:05] <brisk_dacat> Gief effect on you is understandable
[4:04:13] <peachy996> I remember the Venom is fun in bronze but I like the Scorpion more bc you can put a scope on it
[4:04:33] <%machshop> SAVE THOSE HIPS
[4:04:46] <%Puffen0> @peachy996 in 3 you can put a scope on any gun

[4:06:01] <iosephe> but do you
[4:06:03] <$Solid_Stro> I like how innocent Tali was in ME1, then she got more sassy which only improved her c4sageLUL
[4:06:18] <jackelzxaa> tali got a big waifu redesign in 2
[4:06:23] <%BarujaraciGaming> I dunno @patstaresat it doesn't look like you know how to recover health
[4:06:26] <%maskedsongbird> @Solid_Stro She also inexplicably got more horny.
[4:06:33] <feralspidey> I love how shepard can just headbutt enemies at warp speed - even Krogans!!
[4:06:47] <Dunmarkh> that blackhole killed nothing?
[4:06:59] <StevenNewJersey> Garrus just loves to lie
[4:06:59] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Missed an item on the Geth corpse back by the smg
[4:07:00] <%Idziman> making sure they're dead
[4:07:03] <TourettesPlays> Even garrus is wrong sometimes
[4:07:04] <$Solid_Stro> @maskedsongbird That’s also a positive
[4:07:05] <+kekkerscrew> Isn't this the level that was hinting at the whole original ending for ME3
[4:07:06] <%Puffen0> @feliian this is why Tali's voice actor hates the mass effect community lol. so creepy sometimes
[4:07:08] <+kekkerscrew> Wait yep it is
[4:07:17] <%ape_hawk> ah how cute, shes thinking about us
[4:07:24] <medril07> Tali's journal: Shepard is so cute
[4:07:31] <%maskedsongbird> @feralspidey No wonder Shepard can headbutt the Korgan so well in Grunt's loyalty mission then: he's had a lot of practice!
[4:07:32] <akitanito> all the geths you missed by charging
[4:07:34] <+FelIian> @Puffen0 oh yea LUL
[4:07:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Wrote the game designer
[4:07:39] <%JoshManVGH> Fun time!
[4:07:42] <TourettesPlays> "I once saw Shepard blow something up, maybe I  could blow something up too!"
[4:07:43] <%ape_hawk> OH MAN, I FORGOT ABOUT THE TALI SWEAT THING, EWWWW

[4:08:36] <%AzureGale> LUL

[4:08:38] <tattleworm> dude was committed

[4:08:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Tali Sweat? you mean Grape Drink

[4:08:48] <stantheman_97> I'm interested
[4:08:49] <%AzureGale> Why would anyone ask!?
[4:08:49] <iosephe> Using science to figure out what her sweat would be like
[4:08:50] <medril07> haha
[4:08:51] <heyterezi> @PatStaresAt it was a guy doing legit, actual science and math to figure out how tali's sweat would either taste or be like
[4:08:53] <peachy996> Nerds? Overtly horny and specific? NOOOOOO
[4:08:53] <%maenos2> @maskedsongbird you know why
[4:08:53] <$SGrim> @maenos2 That's incredible. Where can I find this.
[4:08:53] <+JonathLP> I thought she was like an insect. Does she even sweat?
[4:08:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they make fun of that guys specifically in 3
[4:08:57] <%DashXero> Is it something we should know if we never visited the Bioware forums back in the day?
[4:08:57] <%Puffen0> like, I like romancing Tali in these games. but man was that post over the line
[4:08:58] <ScreamLord> I hate it and I hate yall for reminding me
[4:09:00] <Goraka91> Okay yeah I can definitely understand why she wouldn't like the fans what the fuck

[4:09:06] <Pookiedaexzile> @StevenNewJersey Don't threaten me wit ha good time
[4:09:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I had to eat. DId we get Tali?
[4:09:10] <%maenos2> @SGrim i think the original forums are gone now but i'll try to recall how to find it
[4:09:13] <%maskedsongbird> @maenos2 I do, but I wish I didn't
[4:09:24] <%Puffen0> @monkeyweed21 where? I don't remember that
[4:09:25] <peachy996> That whole sweat this is something that belongs on 4chan not a bioware forum
[4:09:27] <%ExpressNode> I don't even know what that is and I don't want to
[4:09:28] <%maenos2> @SGrim googel Tali Sweat, first result is a reddit screencap thread

[4:10:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @Puffen0 you can find Tali drinking at one point and ranting about how "its just sweat why are they so interested?"
[4:10:15] <+JonathLP> Damn, I would have romanced her if I knew she was a humaniod
[4:10:16] <peachy996> Tali Sweat guy needed a bonk for sure
[4:10:25] <%Puffen0> @dashxero some guy went WAY too in depth on how her sweat taste
[4:10:34] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt fun fact, Jacks VA is also the voice of Ada Wong and Juhani in KotoR
[4:10:38] <%maenos2> QUOTE FROM THE THREAD "....her sweat's a drug and a natural performance enhancer"

[4:11:06] <James_Quivers> EPIC EXPLOSION
[4:11:08] <%maskedsongbird> Man, Tali's a cute waifu. Why do people gotta make it way more gross?
[4:11:08] <%chiluzza> NIG RADIUS
[4:11:09] <medril07> 101
[4:11:13] <%maenos2> poof
[4:11:13] <%DashXero> @Puffen0 Thanks.
[4:11:14] <stantheman_97> large?
[4:11:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @DashXero the guy used his degree in chemical biology to try and gues the taste of sweat, including diagrams
[4:11:15] <%kujofire990> its not waist high tho
[4:11:17] <SaltyAzteca> LIL FLACCID
[4:11:20] <%GinAndRoses> climbing? sounds hard
[4:11:21] <jackelzxaa> pat you get to play as the giant geth juggernauts in multiplayer and you can get them specced to be literally unkillable if you know how
[4:11:27] <$Solid_Stro> That was flaccid…
[4:11:28] <SpaceGuntank> you can actaually just stand right next to it and take minor shield damage
[4:11:33] <peachy996> A Mech goes off like a nuke in Grunts mission and this gets farty explosion
[4:11:33] <Dunmarkh> @chiluzza ???
[4:11:34] <%Monkeyweed21> BEAR SEEK SEEK LEST
[4:11:38] <StevenNewJersey> could you tho
[4:11:45] <%Garthunox> But thats not waist high pat
[4:11:46] <%DashXero> @Monkeyweed21 Dang.
[4:11:46] <Goraka91> So are there specific incidents why Tali's VA doesn't like the fanbase or did she actually know about the sweat thing?
[4:11:49] <%JoshManVGH> It's also a slide down door...
[4:11:50] <%Puffen0> @dashxero your welcome? I feel like you'd be better off not knowing it OMEGALUL
[4:11:51] <Pookiedaexzile> @chiluzza Wowzers on that typo
[4:11:58] <Goraka91> D:
[4:11:59] <jackelzxaa> is this the geth assault rifle room
[4:12:01] <jackelzxaa> or is it at the end
[4:12:03] <%maskedsongbird> @Monkeyweed21 Wait, a biochem major did it with science? Okay, while it's still gross, that's actually kind of impressive.
[4:12:04] <Profmcstevie> Probably just cave in the area in front of the door and blow that stuff up instead
[4:12:05] <SpaceGuntank> thats a war crime
[4:12:05] <ScreamLord> The ship bombing damaging the door woulda made more sense
[4:12:06] <StevenNewJersey> this place looks safe
[4:12:08] <williamrooster> that was cold
[4:12:08] <peachy996> thats not nice pat
[4:12:09] <+JonathLP> You could have salvaged him
[4:12:11] <stantheman_97> BibleThump

[4:12:30] <leinadtonu> ...
[4:12:32] <%Bane_Kaikyo> yeah, any other video game protag woulda jumped it or found a box to help climb it
[4:12:35] <%maskedsongbird> WILLIAM SHATNER WITH TOO MUCH COFFEE
[4:12:36] <StevenNewJersey> that hurts my brain
[4:12:37] <%JoshManVGH> Well... fuck

[4:12:52] <%Arweynn> SHUT UP I DON'T NEED THIS MIND-POISON
[4:12:54] <jackelzxaa> why doesn't shepard just bring his entire squad on every mission
[4:12:54] <%Garthunox> THERE'S
[4:12:54] <$Solid_Stro> Don’t ruin Mordin for me Pat!
[4:12:56] <James_Quivers> But... What does god need with a spaceship? *I N H A L E*
[4:13:00] <%Garthunox> SOMETHING ON THE WING
[4:13:04] <Pookiedaexzile> In realife you'd freeze from the inside if you were shot by cyrorounds
[4:13:06] <jackelzxaa> arc projector is great against robots and shields
[4:13:06] <%Garthunox> *INHALE
[4:13:07] <StevenNewJersey> that inflicted soul-damage on us
[4:13:07] <+barristerofthebar> I hate you pat for this

[4:13:15] <%wibbwobbler> Wow
[4:13:17] <Profmcstevie> Starlog 13722: found coffee today, can't stop talking, Spock thinks I'm crazy I think he's a nerd
[4:13:18] <peachy996> It could work on all these geth
[4:13:18] <%Puffen0> arc projector just sucks
[4:13:22] <%maskedsongbird> Nevermind, it's more like Shatner on speed and cocaine.
[4:13:23] <ScreamLord> I wish Heavy Weapons still worked like this in ME3
[4:13:27] <jackelzxaa> arc projector needs a lockon target charge to fire
[4:13:31] <%JoshManVGH> Aww black hole gun.
[4:13:34] <+MrAtheGreat> what happened with Mordin? I missed it
[4:13:40] <%Ranryu692> it's good against Geth
[4:13:41] <jackelzxaa> i've never found arc projector to be anything other than fantastic
[4:13:42] <%Ravioli_Ronin> What in the titanfall
[4:13:43] <%AzureGale> THERE IS NO TRY ONLY DO
[4:13:47] <Pookiedaexzile> No...No we couldn't

[4:14:01] <%maskedsongbird> @MrAtheGreat Pat pointed out how his speech patterns sound like Bill Shatner.
[4:14:04] <RushUnplugged> Arc Projector is really good against shields
[4:14:04] <leinadtonu> She misses Shepard
[4:14:06] <jackelzxaa> "I wish shepard could have romanced me in the first game" said tali
[4:14:06] <%GinAndRoses> i wish shepard's dick was here

[4:14:49] <+kekkerscrew> Tali has our back
[4:14:51] <RushUnplugged> they're not colonizing, they're on a research mission
[4:14:53] <%justnathan18> Didnt Tali see you like 3 days ago

[4:15:30] <%machshop> or are you

[4:15:32] <+wizard_of_diamonds> CLIP THAT

[4:15:32] <%AzureGale> LUL

[4:15:33] <tranquilturnip> double true because her neck is the same gold
[4:15:35] <%afronooch> why not
[4:15:38] <+LastnameSilverLastname> @PatStaresAt IS THIS WHAT SHE MEANT BE 'HER SEXIEST BELT' IN ME3?
[4:15:39] <+kekkerscrew> This level right here was supposed to be what Mass Effect was building towards.
[4:15:39] <%maskedsongbird> "TITTY GENIUS" LUL LUL LUL
[4:15:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YOURE MARRYING PAIGE YOU SHOULD BE
[4:15:40] <$Solid_Stro> Pat is here to help
[4:15:42] <James_Quivers> She's got those neck rings that the indonesian women got too
[4:15:45] <%DorianCreed> Ayy lmaos are not for lewd
[4:15:47] <+SenorCounter> Titty Genius takes years to master
[4:15:49] <Zeif00> I can see it
[4:15:51] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Pat denies the titty genius
[4:15:51] <jackelzxaa> they specifically designed tali to look more attractive in 2
[4:15:53] <$realm_forge> Peak character design lol
[4:15:55] <%DorianCreed> Ayy lmaos are for purging
[4:15:56] <+barristerofthebar> @TurtlesAndTentacles lol
[4:15:58] <ioci2112> @jackelzxaa it's nothing compared with liara, talk about a growth spurt
[4:15:59] <jackelzxaa> because she was unexpectedly popular
[4:16:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Ever notice she's one of the only Quarians with the accent....
[4:16:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @DorianCreed THAT IS SO UNTRUE
[4:16:09] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I WISH I was some kind of TITTY GENIUS
[4:16:10] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Quiddy window
[4:16:11] <%JoshManVGH> I thought it was supposed to imply a necklace of some sort
[4:16:11] <+TheBitingIrish> How did you notice notice Mordin's voice tho? It was like the second thing I noticed about him
[4:16:18] <+TheBitingIrish> not notice*

[4:16:32] <+TheWhiteTrey> Hey @patstaresat I’m trying to pick up a fight stick that works on the PS5 version of Strive, did you have any issues with your Qanba Obsidian?
[4:16:33] <%JoshManVGH> Kal survives or noone does!
[4:16:34] <$Solid_Stro> Save Kal!
[4:16:34] <James_Quivers> The BEST weapon in ME3 MP is named after Reegar, it's awesome
[4:16:34] <+FelIian> he got done dirty
[4:16:35] <+kekkerscrew> He's so Effing Cool
[4:16:38] <%Nekros4442> @Pookiedaexzile I mean she "isnt"

[4:16:53] <James_Quivers> CHA CHA SLIDE
[4:16:55] <jackelzxaa> i wonder if they fixed it so you can't get stuck out of a volumebox in me2 with the charge anymore
[4:16:57] <+senfood> oh nonononooooo
[4:16:57] <+MrAtheGreat> The Shepard Shuffle!
[4:16:57] <AmuserName> THAT BUG STAYED IN! PogChamp

[4:18:00] <jackelzxaa> arc projector is FANTASTIC against blue suns and geth
[4:18:01] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL Bully that prime!!
[4:18:12] <$SGrim> The Arc projector is really good at horde management and shield popping.
[4:18:22] <$Solid_Stro> Geth got them white blood like cyborg ninjas sabert14Sip
[4:18:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> BRO THIS LOOKS LIKE A DESTINY STAGE
[4:18:29] <jackelzxaa> black hole gun is great against ecclipse because you can just fire the bomb at their feet and let it explode (Helps if you warp someone who's standing in it)
[4:18:30] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Bane_Kaikyo It was cringe on purpose so it's fine tho
[4:18:30] <%maskedsongbird> That gun is cool. Can't believe I never used that thing. I'll have to check it out on my next playthrough.
[4:18:31] <%Ravioli_Ronin> This one weird trick; Geth hate it!
[4:18:32] <%Monkeyweed21> its amazing at any robot and shield heavy faction
[4:18:35] <tranquilturnip> ow ow ow ahhh
[4:18:50] <%maskedsongbird> @Bane_Kaikyo lol
[4:18:57] <Pookiedaexzile> I just looked up why some qaurians don't have accents, and it makes no sense with the whole living on ships thing. I never knew this

[4:19:43] <tranquilturnip> A HERO
[4:19:55] <jackelzxaa> for collectors and ecclipse, area warp and the black hole cannon are a great combo.  drop the cannon at the feet of a mob, then blast them with warps to get their barriers down and they melt
[4:20:01] <+barristerofthebar> Kal is the only man whose dick is bigger than their rocket launcher
[4:20:08] <DSD24> Gotta save Reegar
[4:20:13] <jackelzxaa> *drop the bomb
[4:20:16] <SpaceGuntank> Quarian marines are such a bad idea but Kal'Reegar is such a badass he makes up for it
[4:20:21] <%maskedsongbird> I love it when they have you fight Geth Colossi on foot. It's hard to get a sense of scale for how big the fuckers are when you're shooting at them from vehicles.
[4:20:27] <jackelzxaa> i always have anxiety over reegar in this because i dont actually know what kills him
[4:20:33] <$Solid_Stro> “I’m High as fuck right now, let’s go!” Kal’Reeger
[4:20:37] <+senfood> THIS GUY OWNS.

[4:20:45] <%rekinom> I'M HERE TO KILL DEM- I MEAN GETH
[4:20:45] <+MrAtheGreat> Reegar had the wrong mask on here or later in the game. It was supposed to be black but instead it was purple, and they fixed it in the LE
[4:20:46] <MrPandastic> I love you Kal
[4:20:46] <%weissguard> Kal'Reegar RULES
[4:20:48] <AthenaAegis> This guy is FUCKING AWESOME SwiftRage

[4:20:56] <DSD24> Man that Geth was just going bzzzzzt
[4:20:56] <akitanito> aren't you happy that talking is a free action?
[4:20:57] <jackelzxaa> this guy is "Quarians are based, too."
[4:20:59] <HaroldDonchee> sniper perch eh? time to calibrate some heads
[4:20:59] <dinnydanny777> He got shot in the ass

[4:21:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Yo this dude is super cool
[4:21:10] <TheIronBrass> I love this guy
[4:21:12] <$Solid_Stro> Quarians are literally the best
[4:21:15] <%maskedsongbird> Man, Kal's the fuckin' best.
[4:21:16] <+OneGorillionDollars> I fucking love this guy
[4:21:23] <%justnathan18> Kal Reegar is the best quarian
[4:21:25] <DSD24> I love his armor design
[4:21:29] <jackelzxaa> theres people that wished he was your me3 squadmate if tali died in 2
[4:21:30] <Zalapski> tali and reegar are basically the only 2 competent quarians in the galaxy LUL
[4:21:32] <$SGrim> @James_Quivers Krogan Reegar would clean up the Genophage by nature of being the man-who-fucks
[4:21:32] <peachy996> It's just cool to see Reegar and Kirrahe to show you the frailest races have hoo rah military men
[4:21:35] <tranquilturnip> He's everything Jacob should be
[4:21:37] <jackelzxaa> i remember posts about that on BSN
[4:21:41] <Archer336> If only Kal could've been a companion.
[4:21:44] <%DashXero> His armor looks pretty cool.
[4:21:44] <tattleworm> do not get this guy killed
[4:21:45] <Broken_Sonex> Hey Kal, can you come with us? Let's replace Jacob!
[4:21:48] <%hrbeck_> is this JK Simmons?
[4:21:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Replace Jacob with him
[4:21:59] <Wolfstriker121> LOUD NOISES LOL
[4:22:05] <LunarRemix> That was awkward
[4:22:10] <+barristerofthebar> @Pookiedaexzile 1000%
[4:22:11] <%justnathan18> Hold the line!
[4:22:11] <akitanito> how did shep not get shot there
[4:22:12] <Pookiedaexzile> But also Notice the Quarian you don't fuck doesn't have the accent
[4:22:14] <tattleworm> he can still die if you don't do this fast enough, but you've got a fair bit of time
[4:22:15] <jackelzxaa> tali got both of her entire squads killed
[4:22:18] <%rekinom> SEMPER FI
[4:22:23] <peachy996> No this is a Baldwin, not the Alec one
[4:22:24] <Wolfstriker121> stand down!!!   BUT HOLD THE LINE THO!!!!
[4:22:25] <%maskedsongbird> This is one of the few Paragon interrupts that's the blatantly correct option, whether you're playing a Paragon Shep or not, lol.
[4:22:25] <+RowenCleric> all the interrupts are so awkward and show their age
[4:22:27] <+MrAtheGreat> You know, it'dve been nice if they added some animations so it'd look WAY less wonky
[4:22:29] <%Bane_Kaikyo> KEELA S'LAI MOTHER FUCKER!!
[4:22:30] <peachy996> His VA
[4:22:31] <jackelzxaa> tali's freedoms progress squad and her haestrom squad both got completely annihilated
[4:22:36] <jackelzxaa> she might be a terrible leader
[4:22:37] <%Puffen0> does the stream have small hiccups and kinda jump back a few seconds for anyone or is it just me?
[4:22:39] <Wolfstriker121> this is a baldwin?!?!
[4:22:42] <Wolfstriker121> WHO THO
[4:22:43] <$Solid_Stro> Keela a Bitch!
[4:22:45] <DSD24> Tarrrrrget
[4:22:46] <%rekinom> "Genocide is based, actually"
[4:22:46] <%AzureGale> I didn't save the universe just by looking pretty
[4:22:52] <peachy996> I think Stephen?
[4:23:00] <$renegade_blade> Adam?
[4:23:02] <jackelzxaa> nova really completes the package on vanguards in 3
[4:23:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> NARROWLY
[4:23:07] <SpaceGuntank> Tali Zorah: Great Engineer, very poor commander
[4:23:07] <+PenmanLupine> Adam Baldwin
[4:23:12] <+RowenCleric> @Puffen0 thats a twitch thing if your internet is fluctuating, happens to me sometimes
[4:23:13] <jackelzxaa> lightning gun
[4:23:13] <$Solid_Stro> I always take the left path sabert14Sip
[4:23:13] <%athuramn> @puffen0 it's rebuffering if your speed isn't keeping up with the qualify you're trying to watch at
[4:23:18] <jackelzxaa> zap that collossus
[4:23:20] <peachy996> There's too many Baldwins. All I know is its not Alec
[4:23:25] <$SGrim> Now is the time for Arc projection
[4:23:26] <%Mattais88> Adam while A Baldwin is not one of THE baldwins
[4:23:28] <+barristerofthebar> F
[4:23:30] <+MrAtheGreat> RIP
[4:23:30] <Wolfstriker121> sSO CLOSE
[4:23:31] <AllenDeadman> lmao
[4:23:32] <jackelzxaa> shoulda used a medkit
[4:23:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat Charges into Bad Cover once again
[4:23:35] <%Puffen0> @athuramn gotcha
[4:23:36] <DSD24> Shepard tripped over the stairs
[4:23:37] <%AzureGale> WELP, TALI'S DOOMED
[4:23:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Charge into Good cover
[4:23:41] <+GuilKato> use lightning gun that is good on geth?
[4:23:42] <$Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL c4sageLUL c4sageLUL c4sageLUL
[4:23:43] <James_Quivers> Reegar would've done it
[4:23:44] <QuestlordJake> too cocky LUL
[4:23:44] <$Futurecity10> This fight blows because the geth spawn infinitly
[4:23:45] <Archer336> Trilogy over.
[4:23:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat taking unnecessary risks
[4:23:46] <%barrakuta371> Little too balls to the wall
[4:23:46] <tranquilturnip> after all that LUL
[4:23:54] <%maskedsongbird> @SpaceGuntank Kind of shows the Migrant Fleet's prioritization skills, doesn't it?
[4:23:55] <%AzureGale> SHOULDA LISTENED TO KAL'REEGER
[4:23:58] <SpaceGuntank> yeah this mission sucks for Vanguard because you cant really charge the Colossus head on
[4:24:00] <alroy900> IT HURTS YOU SHEPARD
[4:24:01] <+D_A_K> maybe... maybe he should have fought
[4:24:03] <jackelzxaa> i'm pretty sure they don't spawn forever, but they do have reinforcements
[4:24:08] <jackelzxaa> unless thats an insanity thing
[4:24:09] <$Solid_Stro> Pat taking one for the team
[4:24:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at were you're gonna land before you jump
[4:24:21] <Chaos_Aether> maybe dont teleport in a middle of  a horde
[4:24:23] <BlackStarAura> ENJOY
[4:24:26] <Broken_Sonex> @alroy900 RETURN MY CALLS SHEPARD
[4:24:34] <%machshop> oof shouldnt have looked up reeger's VA lol
[4:24:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Or not
[4:24:40] <peachy996> The Pros and Cons of ManGuard
[4:24:42] <Profmcstevie> I'm going to attack them....HEAD ON! HYAAAAAA sugoiGuts
[4:24:45] <+OneGorillionDollars> "I'm not gonna let you throw your life away. THATS MY JOB"
[4:24:45] <+MrAtheGreat> I believe you don't have to do the Paragon save to save Reegar, iirc. He has a timer on him and it's just significantly higher if you do the interrupt
[4:24:46] <CrypticMochi> @spaceguntank That manguard video says otherwise
[4:24:46] <+barristerofthebar> ow
[4:24:47] <+D_A_K> @Pookiedaexzile that seems like asking a lot
[4:24:47] <%athuramn> LMAO
[4:24:47] <akitanito> jessus
[4:24:47] <Dova573> pat
[4:24:49] <jackelzxaa> vanguard with a sniper rifle is actually pretty alright because you can soften a mob before you blast in like an asshole
[4:24:51] <pimpingpanda> KEKW
[4:24:52] <AllenDeadman> what was the plan there LUL
[4:24:52] <$SGrim> Instant fuck-up
[4:24:52] <%Puffen0> @machshop who is it?
[4:24:52] <%athuramn> melted
[4:24:53] <Wolfstriker121> YOU ON FIRE NOW LOL
[4:24:55] <%Mattais88> I always take the sun route. No shields but who needs them when you get one enemy at a time
[4:24:55] <BurdRightsActivist> PFPFPRFTHHT
[4:24:56] <James_Quivers> SHEPARD FUCKING BURNED TO DEATH
[4:24:57] <%maskedsongbird> See, the order is fire THEN charge, not charge then fire.
[4:24:57] <%king_wragles> so the arc projector
[4:24:58] <%weissguard> LUL
[4:24:59] <%DashXero> Where's the NBA Jam announcer when you need him?
[4:24:59] <+D00msDayDan> use your squad abilities too, pat
[4:25:00] <Wolfstriker121> SUPER HOT
[4:25:01] <$Solid_Stro> Pat following in the footsteps of Jenkins
[4:25:04] <+Shockrates20XX> you might be a little too aggressive
[4:25:07] <+RowenCleric> a true vanguard
[4:25:10] <jackelzxaa> arc projector would be good here yeah
[4:25:12] <jackelzxaa> for the back mobs
[4:25:13] <knight_verse> GROUNDHOG DAY
[4:25:14] <%walternatorz> Pat is going to save Kal'Reegar like 10 times at this rate
[4:25:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah Vanguard is such a blast but damn it can get hit with walls
[4:25:15] <TourettesPlays> Pat you're taking that ME2 Vanguard infographic a bit too literally
[4:25:16] <jackelzxaa> since they're all bunched up
[4:25:16] <%machshop> @Puffen0 some jerk don't worry about it
[4:25:19] <Pookiedaexzile> The order is Look at who has good position and steal it with chage
[4:25:20] <peachy996> This is where the post charge slowdown helps on Biotic Charge
[4:25:21] <Profmcstevie> Barrier made you weak Pat barbPathetic
[4:25:22] <Pookiedaexzile> LIKE THAT
[4:25:23] <Pookiedaexzile> YET
[4:25:24] <tattleworm> shepard giving this cool speech about how he doesn't need backup, charging in and getting incinerated
[4:25:26] <jackelzxaa> you can just lay a few charges out and take out the whole group
[4:25:29] <mcsassafras> too bad you don't have a cain launcher\
[4:25:30] <badzombie28> More like massive ffecct
[4:25:34] <%AzureGale> Who would've thought that charging straight into the middle of the enemy pack would have severe consequences
[4:25:40] <jackelzxaa> gotta get em while they're together
[4:25:46] <$Solid_Stro> Can we go 3 for 3 Chat? sabert14Gun
[4:25:54] <QuestlordJake> garrus is fucking dead
[4:26:01] <%machshop> [aggressive robot screams]
[4:26:03] <jackelzxaa> 3 in one
[4:26:05] <QuestlordJake> garrus is fucking alive
[4:26:07] <%maskedsongbird> Man that gun is so damn awesome.
[4:26:13] <%Dakuu75> he's doing his best, guys~
[4:26:16] <mcsassafras> time to let old cainless out the bag
[4:26:19] <%Taisuru> God I fucking love the noises they make
[4:26:21] <jackelzxaa> thats good shields damage
[4:26:23] <DSD24> Garrus is dying
[4:26:24] <jackelzxaa> fire
[4:26:32] <%maskedsongbird> Pew pew pew
[4:26:35] <Pookiedaexzile> See what happens when you charge a flank
[4:26:43] <+barristerofthebar> SUPER   SHOT   SUPER   SHOT
[4:26:45] <%machshop> siiick
[4:26:48] <jackelzxaa> boom

[4:27:03] <%machshop> LUL
[4:27:05] <willyfreshness> Fuck, Patshep looks like Red Foreman
[4:27:09] <peachy996> See? Apologize for being mean to Arc Projector chat
[4:27:11] <akitanito> boop
[4:27:12] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Vex pretty much just ripped these off whole, huh
[4:27:15] <%AzureGale> SHEPARD PAWNCH
[4:27:17] <AllenDeadman> what a hero
[4:27:18] <M0untain_wolf> Cast Fist!
[4:27:22] <DSD24> Man that geth was just vibing
[4:27:24] <%RetroCop87> you knocked the robot the fuck out
[4:27:24] <%justnathan18> Punch punch asshole
[4:27:24] <jackelzxaa> they kind of made a few of them in the field and made a small handful of normal guns be kinda like super guns, but i like the feeling of pulling out my super you get with these
[4:27:28] <stantheman_97> he was just dancing BibleThump
[4:27:29] <%Puffen0> @willyfreshness omg he DOES LOOK LIKE RED
[4:27:30] <ianabstract> Go back and check on karl
[4:27:30] <+MrAtheGreat> don't you go back to reegar?
[4:27:31] <shotgang86> !uptime
[4:27:31] <@Moobot> @shotgang86 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 27m.
[4:27:31] <peachy996> Apologize to Gun
[4:27:33] <TourettesPlays> check on kal reeger cause he might be dead
[4:27:42] <%machshop> nonono vex are definitely not geth they are super original
[4:27:46] <Lamokmok> Geth lagging lol
[4:27:49] <DSD24> I think he's ok
[4:27:50] <%Puffen0> he's not dead
[4:27:55] <jackelzxaa> he can die and it's really organic, pat
[4:27:55] <tattleworm> if you take too long, he can die
[4:27:56] <shotgang86> please tell me I'm not too late
[4:27:59] <%maskedsongbird> Phew!
[4:27:59] <jackelzxaa> if he takes enough shots he just dies
[4:28:02] <StevenNewJersey> no, he looks dead
[4:28:05] <xeros720> i think if you take too long he can die? but it takes like 15 minutes
[4:28:06] <%bread_assassin> Kal Reeger can die if you take too long
[4:28:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It'd be funny if you ran all the way back and he's just silently dead on the floor
[4:28:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Shephard should get more bacony the longer you stay in the sun
[4:28:09] <+MrAtheGreat> GETH SLAYER LIVES
[4:28:10] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “Tali did you see me beat that geth to death with my dick?”
[4:28:11] <xeros720> maybe longer
[4:28:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> In like a ragdoll position
[4:28:22] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt getting through Insanity with him alive required so much cheese.
[4:28:29] <%maskedsongbird> @Ravioli_Ronin LUL LUL LUL PogChamp
[4:28:31] <+MrAtheGreat> @xeros720 I think thaat's with the interrupt
[4:28:35] <Pookiedaexzile> You run back and he's already dead : What a shame
[4:28:39] <jackelzxaa> THIS is the room the geth assault rifle would be in
[4:28:41] <%Taisuru> GETH ARE FRIENDS
[4:28:42] <StevenNewJersey> dammit Tali, we dont have time for you to download a summer jams mix
[4:28:43] <%Puffen0> download this patshep dick
[4:28:43] <%ape_hawk> you can download my sperm into your qussy
[4:28:44] <DSD24> Why would Geth carry credits
[4:28:52] <%weissguard> Hey best girl
[4:28:56] <%machshop> thank god we saved hips
[4:29:00] <jackelzxaa> if legion's with you here tali fires on him and he ducks behind cover
[4:29:01] <peachy996> Here is where if you bring Legion along she shouts "GETH!" and takes a shot at him while he ducks for cover
[4:29:09] <%ape_hawk> no, it wasnt
[4:29:16] <shotgang86> man mass effect iis from a time that I feel that videogame storytelling had "16 years old"
[4:29:17] <%ape_hawk> because casey hudson said so
[4:29:19] <James_Quivers> There's impossible to get dialogue for this mission where bringing Legion has Tali start shooting at him instantly lol
[4:29:20] <%justnathan18> We heard you like Purple Tali
[4:29:27] <%DashXero> It was a quiche recipe.
[4:29:28] <jackelzxaa> me3 is so heavy on dialog, it's weird when you get something so squad dialog light like this in me2
[4:29:28] <DSD24> Tali is purple so that automatically makes her great
[4:29:32] <+MrAtheGreat> @peachy996 God that scene's hilarious
[4:29:33] <%Mattais88> I'm still a Jack guy, but Tali is always a close second
[4:29:37] <@commanderclaw> I think Tali turned me into a hip and ass man
[4:29:38] <jackelzxaa> squad dialog in and out of missions is probably the best thing me3 does
[4:29:39] <%maskedsongbird> The Migrant Fleet knowing what's best? That's hilarious.
[4:29:41] <%jillpilled> Those quarians laid down their lives for this very dead plot line!
[4:29:51] <%SinnerEbru> @DSD24 flawless logic
[4:29:55] <DSD24> Oh god
[4:29:55] <AllenDeadman> doesn't this thing never come up again?
[4:29:56] <jackelzxaa> i really hope they use that thing in mass effect 5
[4:30:01] <jackelzxaa> i feel like thats the thing to do
[4:30:02] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp cool
[4:30:02] <%machshop> ???
[4:30:06] <+barristerofthebar> THE MASS EFFECT, PERHAPS?
[4:30:06] <+LiberatedPhoenix> OH LOOK. A PLOT POINT THEY ABANDONED IN 3
[4:30:06] <AmuserName> BibleThump
[4:30:06] <jackelzxaa> to get people to care again
[4:30:09] <+kekkerscrew> Dark Energy YOOO
[4:30:12] <DSD24> @SinnerEbru Purple's the best color
[4:30:13] <%dekkitout> So dark energy affects fusion reaction rates?
[4:30:13] <$SGrim> Something appears to be "Effecting it Mass!"
[4:30:14] <%maskedsongbird> Man, this was such a cool, wasted plotline.
[4:30:16] <tranquilturnip> Everytime Shepard charges a star explodes
[4:30:17] <%OldOnyx> All these people died for nothing... because EA demanded a plot rewrite
[4:30:17] <stantheman_97> oh boy i hope this goes somewhere in the 3rd game
[4:30:22] <%DorianCreed> Ooh, Dark Energy as the plotline for Mass Effect 5
[4:30:22] <peachy996> Hmmm nah. What if AI were bad instead
[4:30:23] <+MrAtheGreat> You'll find out in "NOT" Mass Effect 3
[4:30:24] <$SGrim> it's
[4:30:24] <%DorianCreed> I'd be downf or that
[4:30:25] <AllenDeadman> was
[4:30:27] <%Puffen0> dark energy gets a meh from me
[4:30:29] <%kyh9> OH HEY, ITS THE ORIGINAL MAIN PLOT OF THE THIRD GAME
[4:30:29] <shotgang86> dark energy HUH
[4:30:34] <%YakumoYomi> I'm gonna be real: I totally forgot about this (going into ME3) until you brought it up again
[4:30:35] <TourettesPlays> Space Greenhouse Gases
[4:30:37] <%DashXero> And they abandoned it for 3 colored lights?
[4:30:37] <shotgang86> I hope that was never dropped
[4:30:38] <%kyh9> It made a lot more sense
[4:30:40] <ianabstract> reapers vs. Entropy
[4:30:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Mass Effect Makes Dark Energy
[4:30:47] <%Monkeyweed21> AND THEN IT LEAKED AND CASEY HUDSON DID A STUPID
[4:30:49] <%kyh9> Casey Hudson goddamnit
[4:30:49] <James_Quivers> SPIRAL LIFE, I MEAN PEOPLE, ARE USING TOO MUCH SPIRAL POWER, I MEAN ELEMENT ZERO
[4:30:50] <AmuserName> GURREN LAGANN SPIRAL ENERGY
[4:30:51] <+MrAtheGreat> @PatStaresAt Wait for that to be the plot line for ME4
[4:30:54] <%ItalianWaifu> so they are the anti spiral
[4:30:54] <tranquilturnip> its like literally Gurren Lagann
[4:30:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats so cool
[4:30:55] <%maskedsongbird> Reapers = Kyuubey, is what you're saying.
[4:30:56] <peachy996> It's a better idea than what was given
[4:30:59] <AllenDeadman> that would have been so much better
[4:31:00] <+barristerofthebar> So the reapers are the heros
[4:31:01] <s1rcuit> well shit
[4:31:01] <%Ranryu692> so the anti spiral
[4:31:02] <feralspidey> WOW! Why did they drop that?!?
[4:31:02] <%chiluzza> That actuallyis SO MUCH BETTER
[4:31:03] <%walternatorz> wait, why not destroy the mass effect relays?
[4:31:03] <+pally_din> damn that sounds way better
[4:31:04] <RushUnplugged> it's not even that hidden, the ME tech uses dark energy
[4:31:05] <Pookiedaexzile> THATS TIGHT AS FUCK
[4:31:06] <%dekkitout> Like gamma bursts everywhere?
[4:31:06] <HaroldDonchee> so basically that star trek episode with the corridor
[4:31:08] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt then why did they build it in the first place?
[4:31:10] <%Puffen0> says who?
[4:31:11] <iosephe> But don't the reapers encourage all civilizations to take the same technology path?
[4:31:14] <%rekinom> Why didn't the reapers just do it then
[4:31:15] <%hrbeck_> but muh nonpolitical
[4:31:15] <%machshop> that'd be fuckin sick
[4:31:16] <%SinnerEbru> WHAT THE FUCK THATS ***WAY*** BETTER
[4:31:17] <Pookiedaexzile> THATS COOL AS FUCK
[4:31:17] <%RetroCop87> but then why are the Reapers letting people use ME tech every 50 thousand years!?
[4:31:18] <logothete2401> I don't like the dark energy plotline because it basically means that interstellar society is impossible and everything is hopeless
[4:31:18] <%Arweynn> The Mass Effect causes Outer Wilds, basicly
[4:31:19] <tranquilturnip> EVE online
[4:31:19] <%kyh9> I thought it had to do with heat-death
[4:31:20] <Profmcstevie> Close the keyholes sora....
[4:31:23] <ScreamLord> Mass Effect Tech speeds up the Heat Death of the Universe
[4:31:24] <LunarRemix> That is a really good idea
[4:31:26] <+ultimafullmetal> That doesn't sound like a good ending either
[4:31:26] <+MrAtheGreat> :OOOO:
[4:31:27] <%AzureGale> But Arrival
[4:31:27] <+Sadira_snack_attack> you're making alot of assumptions
[4:31:28] <Pookiedaexzile> THATS WAY MORE POLITICAL
[4:31:30] <%DianaTheAscian> so kinda like gurren?
[4:31:31] <tattleworm> why'd they leave them there then?
[4:31:32] <%JohnAtDawn> eeeeeehhhhhhh that's kinda
[4:31:34] <xeros720> yeah, reapers are overzealous options
[4:31:36] <%NateyBeak> oh  mY god star trek discovery ripped that off too  kinda huh
[4:31:38] <+D00msDayDan> @WackyGear civilizations are easier to prune when they colonize around mass relays
[4:31:38] <DSD24> Do it live!
[4:31:39] <%SinnerEbru> can i fucking punch EA execs
[4:31:39] <%adustconstant> Thats such a western canada plot
[4:31:39] <+barristerofthebar> CLIMATE CHANGE
[4:31:39] <%kyh9> But also...fast
[4:31:40] <%Mattais88> Destory mass effect is better, but making the reapers objectivly right is a bit much
[4:31:41] <%JoshManVGH> Its that Warp episode of Star Trek
[4:31:42] <shotgang86> and why this is not one of the endings?
[4:31:44] <%dekkitout> So Gurren Lagann is renegade option
[4:31:45] <Pookiedaexzile> That's Disco Elysium level good
[4:31:45] <tranquilturnip> how is that renegade LUL
[4:31:46] <xeros720> er, overzealous AI
[4:31:47] <jackelzxaa> something that happens in a dlc makes that destroy ending kinda funky
[4:31:47] <%RetroCop87> so Spiral Energy
[4:31:51] <%king_wragles> @kyh9 Unrestricted mass effect tech use would kill all the suns? That part was covered
[4:31:51] <tranquilturnip> we can ONLY ASSUME LUL
[4:31:52] <+barristerofthebar> boo
[4:31:53] <ioci2112> that's right jay
[4:31:53] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah!
[4:31:53] <%Puffen0> eh, I like the actual ending better
[4:31:53] <tattleworm> why wouldn't the reapers just destroy the relays
[4:31:55] <%Garthunox> the entire fleets of every major civilization would be stuck in sol
[4:31:55] <%maskedsongbird> Damn, Hudson really wasted the potential of this plotline.
[4:31:56] <$Solid_Stro> Leaving all solar systems abandoned
[4:31:58] <jackelzxaa> drew karpeshin did talk about this to this level of detail, pat's right
[4:31:58] <+FelIian> Reapers were looking for a race with powerful enough biotics to slow down or stop the dark energy iirc
[4:31:58] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt but why end civilizations and leave the relays?
[4:31:59] <%Fooguwu> why wouldnt the reapers just blow up mass effect tech
[4:31:59] <%Ravioli_Ronin> You ever think about how many people got killed by destroying the relays/ getting cut off from life-saving supplies/food?
[4:32:03] <RushUnplugged> but people posted that online, and just by accident Hudson changed the ending in a week after that
[4:32:03] <%walternatorz> "we'll figure it out later"
[4:32:04] <+kekkerscrew> One of the plot points was purposefully having Humanity become reapers to help stop it
[4:32:04] <LunarRemix> Only to that one specific area!
[4:32:05] <%snow_bush> "Hey Jay, have you heard about Star Trek?"
[4:32:05] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah and that episode was stupid
[4:32:05] <+Dradugun> ayyyyy can't go warp 9 anymore
[4:32:05] <%KaiserMario> JAY STARES AT CAMERA
[4:32:05] <HaroldDonchee> yepp. ruins shit
[4:32:09] <+barristerofthebar> poor space time
[4:32:11] <StevenNewJersey> eh, price of convenience.
[4:32:11] <shotgang86> its the ending fuck the rest of the gameplay consequences its the end of the GAME
[4:32:11] <%Ranryu692> and then they dropped that plot line in DS9
[4:32:11] <%kyh9> FUCKING HELL
[4:32:14] <falyden> close but theres more to the Dark Energy plot
[4:32:15] <%machshop> that's why star trek has speed limits right
[4:32:16] <James_Quivers> The one big issue is why the Reapers would leave the remnants of EEZO tech for races intentionally if that's what's fucking everything up tho
[4:32:16] <%kyh9> STAR TREK DOES IT ALL
[4:32:18] <knight_verse> That's probably the plot of the new Mass Effect.
[4:32:19] <+Sadira_snack_attack> yes...and if you tilt the nacelles it makes everything better
[4:32:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Like Do you want  your children to live or Have Gas Wait where have I heard that before
[4:32:21] <%JoshManVGH> Waro through that sector is limited to Warp 3!
[4:32:22] <%RetroCop87> BUT IF WE DON'T DAMAGE SPACE TIME, HOW WILL I MEET MARK TWAIN?
[4:32:25] <%DashXero> Did they ever fix the problem with warp drives?
[4:32:26] <%Mattais88> @RetroCop87 Holy shit, it is just Spiral energy!
[4:32:28] <CrypticMochi> Sovereign’s dialogue makes it dumb, but that can be fixed unlike that catalyst shit
[4:32:31] <%Monkeyweed21> basically give Galactic Civilization their own advanced mass effect tech so that they can keep track of them and stop idiots from inventing way more destructive mass effect tech
[4:32:34] <+MrAtheGreat> Tbf the Conrtol ending isn't the renegade one. It's just just the one that the evil dude wanted
[4:32:35] <DSD24> Use her huh?
[4:32:42] <shotgang86> I call bullshit on Pat's bullshit
[4:32:44] <$Solid_Stro> So all the mixed species stuck in different solar systems would eventually starve due to not enough divorce resources
[4:32:44] <AllenDeadman> what do you mean this very convenient and apparently endless source of energy is bad to everything?
[4:32:46] <Wolfstriker121> DAMN TALI!!!
[4:32:48] <+barristerofthebar> KAL MY BOY
[4:32:50] <%AzureGale> Damn, girl
[4:32:51] <tattleworm> it's almost like they should've planned out the trilogy in advance instead of winging it like a certain other recent trilogy
[4:32:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I thought those were boobs like pat said
[4:32:57] <QuestlordJake> Reegar you son of a bitch
[4:32:59] <%Maids4lyfe> Dark energy entropy is a hoax created by the Volus.

[4:33:37] <DSD24> I love the mission complete music

[4:33:38] <+RowenCleric> that cut

[4:33:51] <+Punchasaur> PURPLUSSY ACQUIRED
[4:33:54] <HaroldDonchee> plussy aquired
[4:33:54] <jackelzxaa> my Mass Effect 5 predictions: They pick destroy as canon because it means no reapers, no geth (not as much to write around), they should focus on dark energy to get people interested again, and they should bridge the andromeda and milky way galaxies so that game isn't a total waste of time.
[4:33:57] <%afronooch> MY QURUSSY
[4:33:58] <%JoshManVGH> Sure she'll get along with EDI...

[4:35:19] <%shadowsofpain> If you do the Hades dogs it references it
[4:35:20] <%DashXero> But her hating EDI is a shame. EDI hasn't gotten a chance to do anything to her yet.
[4:35:22] <BurdRightsActivist> MAN WE QUARIANS LOVE AI BRO
[4:35:23] <jackelzxaa> they're the best part of the game
[4:35:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Her and Jack have good team chem
[4:35:24] <DSD24> Jacob is here for that Shepard
[4:35:24] <peachy996> Wow Jacob! Stop talking any time!
[4:35:27] <+Dradugun> Is the voice actor for Tali the same for Sypha from Castlevania anime?
[4:35:28] <%Puffen0> until the end of the game yeah lol
[4:35:29] <%miguelrod777> I think that's jacobs best moment
[4:35:30] <%Monkeyweed21> Tali got the biggest glow up from 1 to 2
[4:35:30] <brisk_dacat> Why though
[4:35:31] <%OldOnyx> making peace between the Geth in particular just doesn't make much sense with the new AI vs Organics plot is handled in 3
[4:35:35] <%GinAndRoses> jacob reminding us all that tali is also spacist
[4:35:36] <MrPandastic> She has A LOT of reasons to hate Cerberus.
[4:35:39] <%weissguard> She completed her Pilgrimage and acquired sass to go with the rest of her. It's great
[4:35:47] <Zalapski> real talk, that is jacobs best line in the series
[4:35:55] <+barristerofthebar> DAD MAIL
[4:36:01] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Tali’s not a spaciest, she’s a space-Zionist Kappa

[4:36:27] <Archer336> @OldOnyx I think they only try to make it make sense with the fact that Legion split off from the rest of the Geth.

[4:37:22] <Brandon__Brando> he looks like a huge asshole in that sweater
[4:37:22] <$SGrim> I'M GOING TO FIND OUT FOR YOU KELLY
[4:37:25] <BurdRightsActivist> They look like A BAD PHOTOSHOP
[4:37:26] <%walternatorz> "I don't know, have you been to getty images lately?"
[4:37:26] <tattleworm> she's just spiders
[4:37:26] <+KoldFusion87> OMFG DID THEY CHANGE KELLY, I DONT BELIEVE IT
[4:37:26] <+barristerofthebar> Nah, Kelly wants IN
[4:37:27] <critiquequartz> Did pat get the hamster?
[4:37:27] <%DorianCreed> @RetroCop87 Nah - she just likes to watch
[4:37:27] <+senfood> Kelly is my favorite. She loves xenos like I do.
[4:37:31] <peachy996> Tali also has a DLC outfit
[4:37:36] <s1rcuit> can the fish die if you don't feed them?
[4:37:39] <%MugenSandan> Kelly would calculate what their sweat smells like
[4:37:40] <$Solid_Stro> Go to forums, you’ll find out Kelly
[4:37:40] <%Puffen0> KELLY WAS THAT FORUM GUY ALL ALONG
[4:37:40] <nuane> Kelly would get written up
[4:37:41] <CrypticMochi> They’re a shitty photoshop under that suit
[4:37:43] <+robuttastic> dont worry kelly they look just like humans but different colors
[4:37:44] <%snow_bush> Blue humans
[4:37:45] <%JoshManVGH> Ok that i forgot the "What their skin feels like" line, holy shit
[4:37:46] <Lamokmok> Human that are slightly photoshopped sadly
[4:37:47] <%Ranryu692> indeed
[4:37:49] <%machshop> Tali just look good
[4:37:50] <%weissguard> Ye
[4:37:51] <Wolfstriker121> who else can change outfits?
[4:37:51] <%GinAndRoses> quarians are always fly af
[4:37:52] <jackelzxaa> tali's armored up look is great
[4:37:53] <Pookiedaexzile> She don't miss
[4:37:53] <xeros720> the fish do die
[4:37:53] <%chiluzza> Also THIS IS THE FAR FUTURE dont you think they could have FIXED THE IMMUNE PROBLEMS WITH SPACE DRUGS
[4:37:54] <DSD24> @CrypticMochi They fixed that actually
[4:37:55] <%Mattais88> @Puffen0 I know, and it bugs me that I like that ship as much as I do.
[4:37:56] <James_Quivers> That new look has a vizor inside of the helm, it's cool
[4:37:57] <critiquequartz> Yay yay yay space hamster!
[4:37:58] <%RetroCop87> turns out that 'suit with hood' is a pretty good look
[4:38:00] <+FelIian> DLC one is amazing
[4:38:04] <%JoshManVGH> No alt Garrus?
[4:38:05] <HaroldDonchee> Kelly's like that girl that helps you with all the people you like but is seething inside because they want the shepdick
[4:38:07] <%ItalianWaifu> Kelly made the sweat posts
[4:38:07] <jackelzxaa> she uses the default me2 armor in 3 anyways so i like to use that armor in this game for variety
[4:38:08] <peachy996> You can't mess up Quarian Armor

[4:40:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> no. you need spaces like that
[4:40:19] <ianabstract> its just some radiation, it's not like cancer is dangerous anymore
[4:40:20] <%RetroCop87> it uses humans as fuel
[4:40:20] <mutantlunchbox1> just a little sniff of radiation
[4:40:21] <DSD24> Look how good she looks
[4:40:22] <%Maids4lyfe> it
[4:40:22] <fugly_nick> We'll bang ok
[4:40:23] <peachy996> It's not like it was protected in the first game either
[4:40:23] <NireFuster> Aaah don't worry about it it's fine
[4:40:24] <+PenmanLupine> what would glass do? it blows up, everything blows up.
[4:40:24] <%Arweynn> isnt that just the Event Horizon warp drive room?
[4:40:25] <%Ynkubus_> lick it
[4:40:26] <$Solid_Stro> You worry too much Pat
[4:40:26] <+GuilKato> there wasnt glass on old normandy it was just spinning and lightning
[4:40:27] <jackelzxaa> if you do the engineer's sidequest NOW tali will play poker with the 3 of you
[4:40:28] <+PenmanLupine> anything else is a formality
[4:40:28] <%Maids4lyfe> it's mass effect it's safe
[4:40:28] <%king_wragles> @GuilKato aaaannndddd, yes
[4:40:30] <%charp35> The old Normandy was also exposed
[4:40:30] <$realm_forge> Shepard has super cancer now
[4:40:30] <srv4254> good for lungs
[4:40:30] <akitanito> it's chernobyl all over again
[4:40:31] <NeroInfinite> It's fine
[4:40:31] <SkinnyRite> containment field pressure space bullshit?
[4:40:33] <stantheman_97> give me the quarssy
[4:40:37] <%JoshManVGH> Remember the last Normandy that PULSED at the people in the room?
[4:40:39] <%Ravioli_Ronin> It’s fine just look into the reactor
[4:40:40] <logothete2401> If something goes wrong you're probably fucked anyway

[4:40:49] <BlackStarAura> Important Upgrade!
[4:40:51] <%maskedsongbird> A metric FUCKTON of palladium, no less.

[4:41:00] <%Monkeyweed21> MINING STREAM
[4:41:04] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Q U S S Y
[4:41:05] <DSD24> @TurtlesAndTentacles They can do skin to skin or Nerve Stim programs
[4:41:08] <jackelzxaa> it's really weird how the big upgrades aren't tied to a quest or a decision you have to worry over.  you just ask for it and they say "here's the thing that makes thane not die"
[4:41:11] <Dead_Trickster> Tali's voice makes my heart go 'doki doki'
[4:41:12] <Pookiedaexzile> You can't see her eyes as well anymore
[4:41:16] <+D00msDayDan> when's the mining stream
[4:41:17] <%Puffen0> @patstaresat how do you feel about Shepard grooming Tali into a relationship going back to me1?
[4:41:19] <StevenNewJersey> just give me a rubber band and duct tape and i can make anything
[4:41:24] <HaroldDonchee> ok space MacGyver calm down

[4:41:38] <Skottt3> Pat's Shep looks like Ron Howard
[4:41:41] <%chiluzza> lets give you a radiation bath
[4:41:44] <%ItalianWaifu> Tali zor Magiver
[4:41:45] <%JoshManVGH> Is this the suite she smokes inside of?
[4:41:46] <$Solid_Stro> “Can I lick your face mask?”
[4:41:48] <Broken_Sonex> LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR QUSSY
[4:41:48] <%maskedsongbird> Don't worry, they won't.
[4:41:49] <Wolfstriker121> YEAH JUST MAKE OUT IN THE OPEN area off element zero!!!!
[4:41:49] <badzombie28> Why does she hate Cerberus
[4:41:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @DSD24 Whoa really? Like Swamp thing? a Simulated thng?
[4:41:58] <peachy996> All for useless data that never gets brought up again

[4:42:04] <dscarface07> LUL LUL LUL
[4:42:04] <%TheotherKristian> Is Pat gonna nut with a different alien this time around?
[4:42:05] <%TheYellowcouch> Tali is just. the inherent sexual allure of a glass Coke bottle
[4:42:11] <Wolfstriker121> making out while element zero pulsing around the area... lol!!
[4:42:15] <jackelzxaa> the no upgrades version of what happens with this engine core at the end of the game is kind of nuts.  tali just gets incinerated into dust in an instant
[4:42:15] <%Ranryu692> Foreshadowing
[4:42:15] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Why wouldn’t she hate cerberus
[4:42:18] <DSD24> @TurtlesAndTentacles Yeah Tali talks about it as does Mordin if you romance her
[4:42:23] <Dunmarkh> THE CONCLAVE TENNO

[4:43:36] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes
[4:43:38] <jackelzxaa> thats a quest dependant
[4:43:38] <tattleworm> yeah
[4:43:40] <$SGrim> Yes
[4:43:40] <$Futurecity10> yes
[4:43:40] <Wolfstriker121> yes
[4:43:40] <+TheBitingIrish> PEE PEE
[4:43:40] <ScreamLord> Yes
[4:43:41] <%Puffen0> yes
[4:43:42] <%Shubreaker> yeah
[4:43:42] <%shootbang_exe> I think so
[4:43:42] <peachy996> Yes
[4:43:42] <JoshTheFace> yes
[4:43:43] <jackelzxaa> she says something different if you dont do them
[4:43:43] <+critikal_bit> Yup
[4:43:44] <%JoshManVGH> Probably yeah
[4:43:45] <fugly_nick> I would assume so
[4:43:45] <$realm_forge> HEY TALI WANNA TEST THESE GUARD RAILS?
[4:43:46] <+MrAtheGreat> yeah
[4:43:48] <%shadowsofpain> yup
[4:43:48] <+djinnJuice> Those are mandatory quests iirc
[4:43:52] <critiquequartz> Yes
[4:43:56] <%DashXero> I think that question is there for people who didn't play ME1.
[4:43:58] <ioci2112> tali wants the shepdick so bad she's willing to die for it
[4:44:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack is one of those Experiments
[4:44:01] <FassieFons> PEEPEE
[4:44:03] <%Garthunox> @djinnJuice nope
[4:44:04] <NeroInfinite> yes
[4:44:05] <CrypticMochi> I think question is for new players
[4:44:05] <%ainzhelm> Yes
[4:44:05] <%AzureGale> THE BABY
[4:44:05] <%afronooch> they arent mandatory
[4:44:06] <%Shubreaker> baby time
[4:44:08] <%JoshManVGH> At least that one rear admeral quest
[4:44:09] <StevenNewJersey> i lub emlo
[4:44:11] <fugly_nick> Kitty katty
[4:44:13] <critiquequartz> It’s the admiral kohaku quest line
[4:44:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @djinnJuice they super arent
[4:44:16] <%maskedsongbird> Tali, report to the top floor. We'll bang, ok?
[4:44:18] <%Taisuru> Elmoooo
[4:44:19] <%shadowsofpain> It's also why Miranda mentioned that it was a different cell from the Lazarus cell
[4:44:20] <tattleworm> i think you get something conditional when talking with edi for the first time too, but it requires a renegade choice
[4:44:21] <jackelzxaa> it would have been really interesting if mass effect 2 let you just not work with cerberus as a paragon entire path through the game
[4:44:24] <+MrAtheGreat> How can working for them be wrong they giver me shipppp
[4:44:27] <%ainzhelm> She doesn’t use that line if you’ve never met them in ME1
[4:44:29] <reasonance> is elmo a big boi or is he just really furry?
[4:44:30] <%Monkeyweed21> HEY TALI I GOT A SUIT PUNCTURE FOR YOU
[4:44:38] <AmuserName> BOOK STUFF
[4:44:40] <fugly_nick> That question is fucking stupid Shepard
[4:44:46] <ScreamLord> Jack
[4:44:47] <peachy996> "Hey tali do you want me to dip my bald head in oil for you?"
[4:44:52] <%maskedsongbird> @jackelzxaa yeah, but that would've required like, double the resources they put into making the game.
[4:44:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Doesn't it
[4:44:55] <StevenNewJersey> they're trapped in here with me!
[4:44:55] <+FelIian> Not Jack

[4:45:07] <%Puffen0> @djinnjuice nah they're optional. the only thorien quest required is the main quest one. that one doesn't involve Cerberus
[4:45:08] <sweatch0> PP
[4:45:14] <jackelzxaa> originally zaeed's recruitment mission was going to involve you driving through the streets of omega in the Hammerhead hovertank but they cut the vehicle from the game and made it dlc
[4:45:21] <ScreamLord> Too bad Tali isn't available for FemSHep
[4:45:22] <peachy996> You actually won't be ready.
[4:45:23] <HaroldDonchee> man I just realized the illusive man for sure has a picture of shepherds butthole
[4:45:26] <jackelzxaa> also zaeed was one of the original characters they concepted for me2

[4:46:25] <%Monkeyweed21> @HaroldDonchee The illusive man tookpics of your corpse's shit pants
[4:46:25] <%TheYellowcouch> and Jack is the inherent sexual allure of a box of nails
[4:46:26] <%ainzhelm> What?
[4:46:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Theres enough dick scent for 2
[4:46:28] <%mikeriffic> gotta wash the blue off still
[4:46:29] <$Solid_Stro> *SNIFFF*
[4:46:31] <mak0t0yukii> I SENSE THE HORNY
[4:46:35] <StevenNewJersey> "they made me listen to CHER"
[4:46:37] <$Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL c4sageLUL c4sageLUL
[4:46:37] <DSD24> These wounds they will not heal
[4:46:49] <AmuserName> she can smell the anti-fungal ointments wafting off of tali when you enter the room.
[4:46:51] <%TheYellowcouch> tho the alt outfit is a significant upgrade
[4:46:56] <$Solid_Stro> “Now I have to listen to your penis with Tali” Jack
[4:46:58] <+Punchasaur> cool google glass
[4:46:58] <logothete2401> Man fuck Cerberus
[4:46:59] <%TheYellowcouch> holy shit
[4:47:01] <StevenNewJersey> all the best psychics have to suffer
[4:47:02] <Brandon__Brando> god the male shep voice actor is so bad
[4:47:03] <%maskedsongbird> @TheYellowcouch So what you're saying is that the Jack stans are all fans of Hellraiser?
[4:47:03] <$SGrim> Funniest part, Jack's biotics aren't even the best a human can get. She's a failure on every level.
[4:47:04] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah pat you weren't kidding she looks so much better
[4:47:05] <%ainzhelm> Jack. Get back here. You aren’t allowed to get that far away from your npc position
[4:47:06] <AllenDeadman> sure is
[4:47:22] <Broken_Sonex> Something something IN MY SKIIIIIN something something
[4:47:34] <Pookiedaexzile> I for one, can respect a lady whose tits I'm seeing
[4:47:36] <StevenNewJersey> "i never asked for this"
[4:47:37] <%ItalianWaifu> @SGrim wait what, really
[4:47:37] <dinnydanny777> You enjoy all the killing, that's why
[4:47:40] <%Piemono> To be honest those leather straps looked like they chaffed
[4:47:44] <%Shubreaker> I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS
[4:47:46] <VeryTricky> can you tell that Jack is an angry and brooding character with the REALLY RED LIGHTING
[4:47:52] <%ainzhelm> THEY WHERE TRYING TO CREATE DEADPOOL
[4:47:53] <%maskedsongbird> She reminds me of the goth and emo girls I used to hang out with in high school.
[4:47:54] <%Puffen0> why don't you like her original clothes @patstaresat
[4:47:59] <$Solid_Stro> Jack definitely listens to Linkin Park
[4:47:59] <DSD24> Red means angry
[4:47:59] <%Mattais88> As bad as Jack's stuff is, she's literally on par with an Asari Matron. Way far above whatever gene baby Miranda can do.
[4:48:00] <feralspidey> yeah, it was super awkward the first time in this game when she talks about being a little girl in a cell... and you see her parts
[4:48:11] <akitanito> she looks like she belongs in shadowrun now
[4:48:18] <%machshop> we gotta get he back to Night City
[4:48:19] <Blank9> She showed them, she showed them all
[4:48:20] <Brandon__Brando> wish she didnt have the glasses but the outfit is great
[4:48:21] <StevenNewJersey> the best kind of naked!@
[4:48:22] <%machshop> her
[4:48:23] <jackelzxaa> jack was a child sex slave.  that's fucking horrible.
[4:48:26] <fugly_nick> It's just an ugly design
[4:48:29] <+Goliz> I don't like this visor, I wish you could removed the visor
[4:48:29] <AllenDeadman> she literally has a micro micro vikini\
[4:48:32] <jackelzxaa> i mean for her to have gone through that
[4:48:33] <$SGrim> @ItalianWaifu both Kaiden and Shepard can use a more effective suite of biotic powers depending on class and upgrade choices. Also, Miranda is her equal.
[4:48:33] <%king_wragles> They're Space Namura belts
[4:48:33] <tranquilturnip> it'd be almost better if she was naked
[4:48:34] <@commanderclaw> She's more naked than actual naked
[4:48:36] <jackelzxaa> it really fucked her up
[4:48:36] <+Ghufufin> lame ass fetish gear
[4:48:36] <+Punchasaur> its for the sex
[4:48:37] <%Ranryu692> it looks terrible
[4:48:38] <+D00msDayDan> none of the appeal of the nudity
[4:48:41] <%justnathan18> Its looks like the Fallout 4 harness
[4:48:46] <%shootbang_exe> yeah her original outfit is super dumb
[4:48:51] <%Taisuru> WRITING
[4:48:52] <StevenNewJersey> THATS WHAT THEY WANTED THO
[4:48:54] <%ainzhelm> @solid_stro Not edgy enough. She listens to simple plan and my chemical romance
[4:48:54] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean her shirtless would have been more tough
[4:49:05] <+MrAtheGreat> ARE THOSE SHADES BOLTED TO HER HEAD?!
[4:49:07] <%maskedsongbird> Jack's design was super improved in ME3. I think the devs knew full well how terrible her original outfit was.
[4:49:10] <%justnathan18> All powerful bitch
[4:49:18] <%Dakuu75> damn gurl
[4:49:18] <+GuilKato> i think Cerberus is just Rogue Cells - other than miranda and jacob everyone else totally rogue
[4:49:19] <StevenNewJersey> CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES
[4:49:20] <HaroldDonchee> I'd like to speak to your manager cerberus
[4:49:20] <jackelzxaa> in one of the jack concept arts she didnt even have the belt on her chest, but they didn't draw nipples so it was that weird anime nudity thing
[4:49:21] <dinnydanny777> Seems fine
[4:49:21] <$Solid_Stro> @ainzhelm SeemsGood
[4:49:21] <CrypticMochi> You will speak with their manager!
[4:49:22] <%dekkitout> Revenge rampage? Can we take Grunt?
[4:49:23] <DSD24> Her Jacket is rad in ME3
[4:49:27] <srv4254> worst loyalty mission
[4:49:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Giving Jack hair was a sin
[4:49:29] <akitanito> "allies"
[4:49:33] <%AzureGale> I WILL TALK TO THE MANAGER FOR YOU
[4:49:33] <%maskedsongbird> Yeah, probably not.
[4:49:39] <peachy996> Pretty much burning away your most traumatic memory
[4:49:40] <fugly_nick> @Pookiedaexzile Big disagree
[4:49:40] <%ItalianWaifu> he'd actually probably own up to it immeadiatly and say get over it
[4:49:45] <%TheYellowcouch> Jack is like the edgy grim dark version of jinx and just kinda don't works
[4:49:45] <jackelzxaa> jack, miranda, and garrus's dlc outfits are them responding to fan requests basically
[4:49:47] <brisk_dacat> Burn it down 🔥
[4:49:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Giving Jack Stepmom undercutt was an extra  sin
[4:49:48] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile DISSAGREE
[4:49:49] <$realm_forge> To a SICK death metal soundtrack!
[4:49:49] <%Dakuu75> It's a date
[4:49:50] <tattleworm> you should take miranda on that mission for extra funsies
[4:49:55] <+Bigbossman91> @srv4254 nah that's Jacobs
[4:49:59] <+senfood> NO DICK
[4:50:00] <jackelzxaa> "make jack look cool, give miranda armor, give garrus regular armor"
[4:50:02] <%justnathan18> Jack looks like every Suicide Girls tattoos on one person
[4:50:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Can you have the sex with Jack?
[4:50:06] <%DashXero> I like the sound of that.
[4:50:07] <jackelzxaa> take jack on miranda's mission, too
[4:50:08] <%shadowsofpain> Take Miranda for maximum snark
[4:50:09] <$Solid_Stro> No dick for you
[4:50:10] <%Mattais88> Bang her then let her dump you
[4:50:10] <jackelzxaa> they both sass eachother
[4:50:10] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA DO IT
[4:50:11] <peachy996> Take Jack and Miranda on each others missions
[4:50:12] <%dekkitout> We spillin tea?
[4:50:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Miranda v Jack dawn of justice
[4:50:17] <tattleworm> it's worth it
[4:50:20] <+Punchasaur> she would look cooler with a jacket and no undershirt or a bandage bra or something
[4:50:20] <%Dakuu75> funzies~
[4:50:23] <$SGrim> @TurtlesAndTentacles yes, but why sully yourself?
[4:50:25] <DSD24> @TurtlesAndTentacles You can romance her yes
[4:50:25] <%maskedsongbird> @TheYellowcouch When you say Jinx, who are you referring to? Because my brain immediately goes to Teen Titians...
[4:50:29] <AmuserName> And Grunt and Mordin!
[4:50:32] <+FelIian> Jack's romance Citadel scene is pretty fucking dope
[4:50:32] <dinnydanny777> @jackelzxaa Well it's okay to show boobas just not nipples I think, nudity censorship in media is often weird like that
[4:50:38] <brisk_dacat> No get closer that shep-dick
[4:50:38] <%TheYellowcouch> legion on tali's mission was THE BEST IDEA
[4:50:40] <%snow_bush> And take Jacob with anyone that has a personality
[4:50:50] <%ainzhelm> @patstaresat and jack on Miranda’s mission too
[4:50:52] <$SGrim> JOKER'S RACIST
[4:50:53] <%Puffen0> OMEGALUL
[4:50:55] <peachy996> Sadly I don't think Grunt has anything important to say about Mordin's Loyalty mission
[4:50:56] <%ItalianWaifu> do Grunt and Miranda every talk about being test tube babies
[4:50:57] <%Parapattern> JOKER
[4:51:01] <$Solid_Stro> Joker… please
[4:51:02] <%JoshManVGH> Holy shit, Jack looks way goddamn cooler in 3!
[4:51:02] <StevenNewJersey> LOVE ARC
[4:51:03] <Broken_Sonex> THAT'S RACIST JOKER
[4:51:05] <%Mattais88> All Quarians look alike, eh Joker?
[4:51:07] <StevenNewJersey> FUCK THE ROBOT JOKER
[4:51:08] <ioci2112> @SGrim miranda is not her equal, jack can hold the biotic barrier in the collector base, miranda fucks up and gets someone killed, samara and jack are the strongest biotics
[4:51:10] <DSD24> @ItalianWaifu Miranda does
[4:51:13] <%CalderGaming> EVERYONE SHUT UP
[4:51:13] <jackelzxaa> @dinnydanny777 yeah i'm just like...did one of the artists think they could get away with a topless character if they didnt model the nipples?
[4:51:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Joker isn't being racist, He's being Spacist
[4:51:17] <brisk_dacat> Joker really
[4:51:18] <+GuilKato> Joker is being AI-Racist like space racist but more so!
[4:51:19] <Pookiedaexzile> because its Space
[4:51:22] <%Dakuu75> lol
[4:51:23] <BlueLunecy> Don't be a narc EDI

[4:51:41] <tattleworm> oh, mordin and grunt on each others is good too @PatStaresAt
[4:51:42] <%weissguard> Joker would fuck the ship if it had an exhaust pipe
[4:51:43] <+FelIian> Kind of hate how they made Legion a much later party member tied to a mission, he has still the dialogue from when he was right at the start of the game
[4:51:45] <fugly_nick> They'll bang, ok
[4:51:45] <%SinnerEbru> they totes wanna kiss

[4:52:21] <BurdRightsActivist> BIGGEST CHARGE
[4:52:22] <%maskedsongbird> @senfood I also would watch that.
[4:52:25] <+GuilKato> A bottle can be found sitting on the bar next to the bartender in the upper level of the Afterlife Club on Omega, where it can be purchased for 1000 credits; at the Dark Star Lounge on Citadel; at Ratch's shop on Tuchanka; or purchased from the drink kiosk at Eternity on Illium after speaking with the bartender.
[4:52:27] <Pookiedaexzile> BIG CHARGE
[4:52:30] <srv4254> team cryo is fn
[4:52:32] <dinnydanny777> @jackelzxaa I mean, I'm pretty sure Bioware have totally done that before in Bioware, it's weird
[4:52:34] <peachy996> If you can get it on Illium you might as well go to Illium
[4:52:39] <StevenNewJersey> Joker and EDI anime? you mean... CHOBITS
[4:52:41] <$Solid_Stro> 🐬Totsugeki Charge🐬
[4:52:43] <jackelzxaa> - Chakwas Brandy is Aria's Bar  - Engineer's Engine Parts is Quarian Omega Shop  - Chef's Food is the Citadel Food Shop on the middle floor
[4:52:44] <DSD24> @ItalianWaifu I don't think they talk about it together if we are talking about Grunt and Miranda
[4:52:47] <peachy996> Oh yeah the datapad
[4:52:48] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt you never checked the voiced codex btw
[4:52:50] <StevenNewJersey> thats right, i made you all remember Chobits
[4:52:52] <tranquilturnip> data padding the game
[4:52:55] <%maskedsongbird> @StevenNewJersey Oh shit, you're super right
[4:52:57] <dinnydanny777> @jackelzxaa I meant to say Dragon Age I hecked up NotLikeThis
[4:52:58] <$SGrim> @StevenNewJersey HOW DARE YOU REMIND ME THAT EXISTS
[4:52:59] <+MrAtheGreat> Orig Jack design feels peak "forced edgy". Kinda like erverything they did for the Prince of Persia WW
[4:53:15] <peachy996> @StevenNewJersey I can never forget melty face Allers
[4:53:17] <%afronooch> me :)

[4:53:34] <%maskedsongbird> @MrAtheGreat The sad thing is 12 to 14 year-old me would eat that shit up...
[4:53:37] <fugly_nick> Just jump through the Omega relay now
[4:53:43] <RushUnplugged> Jack's whole character is "trying too hard", it actually makes sense

[4:54:05] <$SGrim> @Futurecity10 Just fuck your laptop, coward: the anime
[4:54:05] <TourettesPlays> If you played some iOS game you would get extra dialogue on omega from miranda and jacob, is that just naturally integrated now?
[4:54:08] <peachy996> @Futurecity10 Maybe but Allers is a nothing character that the mocap does not do justice on
[4:54:10] <DSD24> I always liked the Team Select music its very ominous
[4:54:12] <%maskedsongbird> @Futurecity10 Yeah, why are people shitting on Chobits? It was all right.
[4:54:18] <+MrAtheGreat> @MrAtheGreat Same, I admit with great shame
[4:54:28] <Pookiedaexzile> IF I see a chick wit ha under cut, That's a normal girl trying to hard, If I see a chick whose bald, she stabs people

[4:55:17] <%afronooch> worth it
[4:55:18] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL
[4:55:18] <%ainzhelm> they might all die
[4:55:18] <dinnydanny777> Would you be killed?
[4:55:19] <tattleworm> all you need now is an elevator
[4:55:19] <peachy996> Go out like a boss though
[4:55:19] <%weissguard> Yeah, but it'd be a pretty sweet ride tho
[4:55:19] <%Dakuu75> death by snu-snu
[4:55:19] <AmuserName> GOD'S TRIANGLE
[4:55:20] <%Mattais88> Too much dextro
[4:55:21] <jackelzxaa> you can't actually have sex with either of them safely
[4:55:21] <HaroldDonchee> die and/or kill them both
[4:55:22] <RushUnplugged> ALIEN CUM POISONING
[4:55:23] <aiutare47> Worth.
[4:55:23] <%AzureGale> So would they
[4:55:24] <$Futurecity10> Dick will melt and asshole rupture
[4:55:24] <stantheman_97> or kill them both
[4:55:27] <Samurai_Tchan> Put the douche googles
[4:55:27] <Profmcstevie> One night to live decadently
[4:55:28] <%Faustgesicht> Everyone would die
[4:55:28] <$Solid_Stro> Worth it
[4:55:28] <%TheYellowcouch> it's what makes it hot!
[4:55:28] <%Monkeyweed21> HOT
[4:55:29] <+GuilKato> if shepard was/is bi they would be a sexy sexy trio
[4:55:29] <tranquilturnip> the most dangerous threesome
[4:55:30] <jackelzxaa> but you can have a relationship of a sort
[4:55:30] <peachy996> GAVORN YEAH!
[4:55:32] <stantheman_97> or they all die
[4:55:32] <%ItalianWaifu> Its how he would have wanted to go

[4:55:36] <fugly_nick> Your welcome
[4:55:36] <+FelIian> think the Dextro/Levo thing is overblown but hey
[4:55:39] <akitanito> this gun clipping is weird
[4:55:40] <Dunmarkh> "paragon"
[4:55:40] <Brandon__Brando> still mad male shep cant bang best boi
[4:55:41] <critiquequartz> Why can’t den shep romance tali?
[4:55:43] <BerryliciousDefinition> Bioware was a coward for not letting us do that
[4:55:44] <%Shubreaker> what a way to end it tho
[4:55:51] <peachy996> I love this guy
[4:55:52] <ioci2112> @SGrim miranda wants to believe she's as good as jack, she also volunteers for the biotic barrier in the collector base, but she fucks up in the end and the seeker swarms kill someone, only samara and jack can get you there safely
[4:55:55] <%bread_assassin> If FemShep is dating Garrus, Tali drunkenly proposes a threesome during the Citadel DLC. @PatStaresAt
[4:55:59] <%ainzhelm> This guys role was supposed to be a lot bigger but he got cut
[4:56:00] <jackelzxaa> thane and liara are the only alien romances that are biologically compatable for safe sex, but you can't reproduce with thane obviously
[4:56:01] <TourettesPlays> killing Tali by banging her quarian goosh pit with Garrus' turian cloaca juices on you
[4:56:05] <Samurai_Tchan> professional larper
[4:56:08] <DSD24> Don't Vorcha only live till 20?
[4:56:09] <jackelzxaa> i think it's canonical that the garrus and tali stuff doesnt go all the way?
[4:56:12] <peachy996> Also implied to be gay in Shadow Broker DLC
[4:56:15] <+MrAtheGreat> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:56:18] <logothete2401> man the Vorcha have it so fucking bad
[4:56:22] <James_Quivers> it is tho
[4:56:25] <+critikal_bit> IT'S SUPER REAL
[4:56:26] <%afronooch> it 100% is
[4:56:26] <fugly_nick> Don't spoil Citadel
[4:56:26] <Profmcstevie> Also DON'T TALK ABOUT THE CITADEL DLC
[4:56:26] <%OldOnyx> it is
[4:56:26] <xeros720> no wonder people say that's the best dlc
[4:56:27] <+FelIian> yup
[4:56:27] <jackelzxaa> that sounds like a joke
[4:56:28] <%bread_assassin> IT IS.
[4:56:28] <+senfood> Yoooooooooo
[4:56:30] <%DorianCreed> 100% is
[4:56:30] <$Solid_Stro> Does killing Vorcha count as murder? Or is just pest control? c4sageLUL
[4:56:30] <%TheYellowcouch> i want it to be real
[4:56:32] <@commanderclaw> It's fanfiction the DLC
[4:56:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Its real
[4:56:33] <$SGrim> @bread_assassin That's perfect
[4:56:33] <RushUnplugged> I haven't seen it but Citadel DLC so it's probably true
[4:56:33] <%OldOnyx> sort of
[4:56:34] <%Monkeyweed21> THERES A LOT IN CITADEL DLC @PatStaresAt
[4:56:35] <tattleworm> you have no idea how fanservicey that dlc gets
[4:56:37] <critiquequartz> Tali loves fen shep
[4:56:37] <+senfood> WORTH IT
[4:56:37] <@commanderclaw> WORTH IT
[4:56:37] <%maskedsongbird> I did not know that. That's awesome.

[4:56:49] <brandt_connors> ah yeah best ME2 armor right there
[4:56:50] <fugly_nick> Pat needs to know as little about Citadel as possible

[4:56:55] <+FelIian> I love it
[4:56:55] <jackelzxaa> shepard would die from getting garrus's drill duck penis in her

[4:59:59] <jackelzxaa> if you give garrus light armor in me1 and put his helmet on in an oxygen environment it's the only time in the series you can see him without his visor on
[4:59:59] <+senfood> IT'S OK. HIS POISON PISS IS STILL GOOOD.
[5:00:00] <%ItalianWaifu> took his shot to the face better than Saren did

[5:00:18] <M0untain_wolf> CHAOSS
[5:00:20] <%cvp5127> why do you even have pineaple juice in the house
[5:00:27] <%TheYellowcouch> Paige can have a little pineapple... as a THREAT
[5:00:28] <M0untain_wolf> SPICY!!
[5:00:28] <Samurai_Tchan> in ME 5 shepard should be a turian ,who cares about the human representator
[5:00:29] <Brandon__Brando> @FelIian fuck
[5:00:29] <BurdRightsActivist> Genuine question: why do you have pinapple juice if paige can't drink it?
[5:00:30] <TourettesPlays> Is Paige dextro based and thats why she's so at odds with her environment???
[5:00:36] <brisk_dacat> Pineapple makes you shit??
[5:00:38] <+MrAtheGreat> REN
[5:00:42] <+MrAtheGreat> EGADE

[5:00:48] <+senfood> LUL LUL LUL
[5:00:52] <%ainzhelm> Turians love mustard?
[5:00:54] <%AzureGale> LUL
[5:00:55] <@commanderclaw> A different Amino Acid basis
[5:00:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige would be a Quarian
[5:00:58] <akitanito> paige in envirosuit when
[5:01:04] <M0untain_wolf> Paige is quarian comferrmed
[5:01:04] <jackelzxaa> you can't actually french kiss turians or quarians without one of you getting sniffles
[5:01:05] <Afterman_> "food"
[5:01:07] <aiutare47> Paige is quarian makes sense
[5:01:11] <+Cacti_Israphe> THAT'S LITERALLY NOT HOW IT WORKS IRL AAAAAAA
[5:01:11] <%AzureGale> Do Quarians like McDonald's food
[5:01:12] <jackelzxaa> or getting pains
[5:01:12] <Afterman_> pat means jizz
[5:01:17] <%Garthunox> Amino Acid basis
[5:01:17] <%OldOnyx> which isn't how it works irl but w/e
[5:01:22] <Badgerconda_> Pat just wants Paige to dress up like Tali while they fuuuuuck
[5:01:24] <%ainzhelm> Oh jeez. We need fanart of pat in a volus suit
[5:01:25] <Pookiedaexzile> She'd never be allowed back on Fortilla because she keeps breaking shit
[5:01:26] <artoflec> put paige in one of those bubbles
[5:01:26] <M0untain_wolf> Welp
[5:01:27] <+senfood> Paige confirmed for Tali.
[5:01:28] <%Parapattern> Paige in a tacky gold quarian suit
[5:01:29] <peachy996> @jackelzxaa sounds like a challenge
[5:01:30] <+FelIian> it would just pass through your system without interacting with anything
[5:01:31] <+GuilKato> which is weird - eating articial sweetner doesn't kill you instantly
[5:01:31] <%dekkitout> I think Paige could pull off a mustard-yellow Quarrian cosplay
[5:01:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Paige is a full-on Charisma build. No End, No con, all CHA
[5:01:37] <Brandon__Brando> @jackelzxaa worth it
[5:01:38] <RushUnplugged> Paige CANNOT be Tali
[5:01:40] <%AzureGale> OHHHHHH BURN
[5:01:42] <BlackStarAura> COSPLAY WHEN
[5:01:44] <RushUnplugged> Paige is a wlking EMP
[5:01:45] <fugly_nick> Is Paige a talented technical engineer?
[5:01:48] <akitanito> now dat's racistssss

[5:01:55] <brisk_dacat> Paige makes coffe well that’s engineering
[5:01:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige would be the one Bad quarian
[5:01:59] <StevenNewJersey> her intelliegence is an integer overflow
[5:02:00] <akitanito> she's talented in dismantling tech
[5:02:01] <%AzureGale> If Paige were actually a Quarian she would be DEAD from that burn
[5:02:02] <%mikeriffic> wait wait
[5:02:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Brute Smarts
[5:02:03] <tranquilturnip> Paige is really good at taking things appart
[5:02:03] <jackelzxaa> paige would go on her pilgrimage and get lost trying to find the exit to the air lock from the migrant fleet
[5:02:06] <feralspidey> all of them have to be engineers, or else they can't fix their vagabond fleet
[5:02:07] <%mikeriffic> she couldnt get through the phone boss?
[5:02:09] <%miguelrod777> I can nearly hear pat and Paige over omega dance music
[5:02:10] <+GuilKato> we all remember Paige trying to solve RE7 shadow puzzles
[5:02:15] <%JoshManVGH> Is paige what happens if a quarian lives outside their suite?

[5:25:37] <Dunmarkh> maybe her dad is human
[5:25:38] <+goose_attack_almanac> It is standard Asari practice to expose womb
[5:25:40] <%heartlesshealer> bellybuttons are telepathic aesthetics
[5:25:41] <TheIronBrass> YEAH THANE
[5:25:41] <ScreamLord> Because they give live birth?

[5:26:20] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Are the Asari really casting shade on the Batarians for slavery while talking about how the market price of their "indentured servants" are doing?
[5:26:21] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @shadowsofpain with their umbilical cords located in the exact same place as a humans?
[5:26:22] <%Mattais88> ACTUAL QUESTION: How do the Arasi figure out who will bear the child?
[5:26:22] <jackelzxaa> they should have had a batarian squadmate in me3
[5:26:23] <Pookiedaexzile> I think its a mind trick
[5:26:24] <%DashXero> Are there any Star Trek races you just feel bad for?
[5:26:24] <jackelzxaa> it was the time to do it
[5:26:25] <StevenNewJersey> Slavery's starting to sound less coool than they want it to sound.
[5:26:25] <%shadowsofpain> They give birth to live young Pat, they don't lay eggs.
[5:26:28] <captain_kirkhammer> Are Batarians like Dragon Age elves?
[5:26:29] <+RowenCleric> but Uncle Pat Shepard hates Batarians

[5:26:49] <iosephe> Give it some time
[5:26:50] <%walternatorz> there was a plague on omega
[5:26:50] <%heartlesshealer> Omega was HONEST about its scumbaggery
[5:26:51] <Desthanos> Yeah and the same can happen on Illium.
[5:27:00] <Alzero83> Batarians are gross
[5:27:01] <%spartanghost004> hey listen now we will just shoot you behind your back
[5:27:02] <%HairballCT> at least omega is upfront about being a shithole

[5:54:19] <%spartanghost004> they will live forever
[5:54:19] <%tank7013> That's a really weird thing to do putting on the uniform you genocided your husband's people in for sexy time
[5:54:21] <critiquequartz> Please talk to char the Krogan in the other sale floor
[5:54:23] <%jillpilled> Ass girl RISE
[5:54:24] <ScreamLord> Hell Krogan might have even longer lifespans than Asari if they don't die in a battle
[5:54:26] <iosephe> how does it even work
[5:54:27] <Broken_Sonex> A WOMEN OF CULTURE ASS LADY
[5:54:27] <StevenNewJersey> trust the science!
[5:54:27] <Wolfstriker121> A woman of culture I see
[5:54:29] <+JonathLP> Science is wrong
[5:54:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Can you get tattoos and hangout in the bottom of my Ship
[5:54:36] <captain_kirkhammer> nature/nurture
[5:54:39] <peachy996> Yeah she's a great Asari and I usually hate most Asari
[5:54:40] <%CalderGaming> pat's greater asari race theory
[5:54:43] <xeros720> asari are just built different
[5:54:45] <%X2Eliah> Pat, how could you tell her being Krogan and not human?
[5:54:46] <%Shubreaker> "genetic material"
[5:54:47] <hairtoday> asari use the father to randomize genetics, it's a random seed
[5:54:47] <+MrAtheGreat> Nature vx nurture
[5:54:47] <%TheYellowcouch> oh no
[5:54:50] <Blank9> if they weren't mind controlling you, you'd be able to visibly distinguish them easier
[5:54:50] <%mads_valentine> It might be cultural Pat.
[5:54:50] <$Solid_Stro> Woolie believes in science
[5:54:50] <%machshop> oh yeah that's true
[5:54:51] <fugly_nick> I don't think thats a genetic thing
[5:54:51] <+MrAtheGreat> ???
[5:54:54] <+JonathLP> Pat is an asari race realist
[5:54:55] <%YakumoYomi> That might be up to upbringing, rather than genetics.
[5:54:56] <%Shubreaker> they're tattoos pat
[5:54:58] <%TheYellowcouch> You can totally do skull science on them
[5:55:02] <logothete2401> I mean thats because they paint them on though
[5:55:05] <Pookiedaexzile> The Face Paint CHanges to look like the Parent
[5:55:05] <%spartanghost004> Nuture pat nurture
[5:55:07] <+vaderxyz1970> few hundred years afterwords
[5:55:07] <jackelzxaa> the tattoos aren't genetic they're cultural
[5:55:08] <trickquestionz> Advanced Alien Race Theory
[5:55:10] <+GingerStrawhat> Asari and Asari are like really deep Blue I think
[5:55:10] <%Ranryu692> thats not how asari reproduction works, Pat
[5:55:10] <logothete2401> Turians paint those
[5:55:11] <%barrakuta371> I wonder what human/asari kids would act like. Guess we'll find out in ME4.
[5:55:13] <Afterman_> did her voice just get like country
[5:55:14] <%Taisuru> AND THEN?
[5:55:14] <+Peacefrog7> damn
[5:55:16] <stantheman_97> it's not genetic but mental
[5:55:19] <aiutare47> According to the game, zero dna is actually swapped. Which makes not a whole lot of sense but whatever
[5:55:20] <xeros720> she's fuckin taller than shephard
[5:55:21] <%JohnAtDawn> 23 years
[5:55:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Salarians have facepaint that looks like the horns
[5:55:24] <%Ranryu692> 28 years
[5:55:24] <%Canti510> Yeah
[5:55:26] <%king_wragles> Chin scales, eyes, voice
[5:55:27] <%machshop> within Anderson's lifetime
[5:55:29] <s1rcuit> < 30

[5:55:35] <%maskedsongbird> About like 35 to 40 years.
[5:55:36] <%shadowsofpain> 28 at this point
[5:55:37] <%Canti510> actually infants
[5:55:37] <+MrAtheGreat> Babeees

[5:55:38] <%Ranryu692> it was 26 in ME1
[5:55:42] <%justnathan18> at this point is 32
[5:55:42] <medril07> huh
[5:55:44] <aiutare47> Infants
[5:55:45] <StevenNewJersey> 4 months ago
[5:55:46] <+Peacefrog7> are still infants at this point right
[5:55:50] <%jojo_abob> yeah anderson fought in the contact war
[5:55:51] <AllenDeadman> babies
[5:55:52] <feralspidey> Oooof
[5:55:52] <+vaderxyz1970> how long are asari children like 40 years?
[5:55:54] <+D00msDayDan> man we're never gonna see human asari
[5:55:55] <+Peacefrog7> im thinking baby yoda
[5:55:56] <tanarath> So 20-30 tops
[5:55:56] <%Faustgesicht> Younger than liara by a long shot
[5:55:57] <ScreamLord> 20 maximum
[5:55:57] <RushUnplugged> human/asari babies would still be on Thessia, even if they looked "adult"
[5:55:57] <peachy996> God I love this song that plays at the bar
[5:55:59] <%TheYellowcouch> what if all Krogan/Asari's wore little hats like their krogan parent
[5:56:02] <+goose_attack_almanac> @Monkeyweed21 All asari have scales to be fair. Hers are just very pronounced around the chin.
[5:56:06] <Afterman_> oh shit
[5:56:08] <StevenNewJersey> SHE DOES HAVE A QUAD!
[5:56:08] <%spartanghost004> especially in the eyes of asari
[5:56:09] <fugly_nick> Wait
[5:56:10] <+DarkDsion> the eye and voice
[5:56:11] <critiquequartz> God I love that
[5:56:11] <+Daigrey> she's fucking awesome
[5:56:13] <medril07> shaking ass huh?
[5:56:14] <%spartanghost004> they are fetuses
[5:56:14] <StevenNewJersey> ....show quad
[5:56:14] <Afterman_> they actually killed each other? damn
[5:56:15] <$Solid_Stro> Wow
[5:56:15] <%maskedsongbird> @Ranryu692 They explicitly say in the first conversation with Pressly that the First Contact War was about 30 years prior.
[5:56:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Her head paint has exposed forhead and scales on the cheeks
[5:56:18] <+senfood> OH SHE IS SO KROGAN
[5:56:19] <Wolfstriker121> Have we seen a asari/human in the series yet
[5:56:22] <FlyguyJP> ZING
[5:56:23] <+RowenCleric> who is Liara's dad?
[5:56:24] <fugly_nick> That's what she got from the Krogan?
[5:56:25] <+MrAtheGreat> Yo calm down
[5:56:26] <%maenos2> her voice is a bit gravely too like a krogan
[5:56:27] <RushUnplugged> I don't think they look like children for decades but they're culturally immature
[5:56:33] <%afronooch> 26 is about 30 tbf
[5:56:43] <%barrakuta371> @Wolfstriker121 No
[5:56:43] <%justnathan18> First contact with Turians is 2157
[5:56:46] <Pookiedaexzile> I love how we all turned into Measurehead for Asari
[5:56:46] <peachy996> Evacuating Thessia?
[5:56:49] <+goose_attack_almanac> >.>
[5:56:51] <StevenNewJersey> ...are there any Varren/Asari?
[5:56:52] <hippofant> Palavan is in ME3 too
[5:56:55] <James_Quivers> Palaven gets FUCKED first, actually
[5:56:56] <%Ixiah> space elves
[5:56:56] <tattleworm> it's the only one you visit, but the turians get fucked up too
[5:56:56] <GandhiTheTerrible> aaaaah i love the music here
[5:56:57] <+FelIian> @PatStaresAt turian tattoos aren't natural, they are marks of their clans/colonies
[5:56:59] <+MrAtheGreat> That’s pretty much how it goes down tbh
[5:57:00] <Desthanos> Because the Asari REALLY fucked up their tactics against the reapers.
[5:57:05] <%jillpilled> Pretty fitting them and Turians get it probably the worst
[5:57:06] <FlyguyJP> Turians got super nuked
[5:57:07] <+goose_attack_almanac> @James_Quivers he hasn't played it
[5:57:08] <+GingerStrawhat> It's kinda like what happened to the Vulcan/Romulans in Star Trek 09
[5:57:09] <+ColonelHandzLanza> Earth is pretty bad at the end of 3 if you consider the rounds that missed the reapers impacted earth
[5:57:10] <aiutare47> The Asari also don’t really have a military
[5:57:13] <%spartanghost004> oh that is not the only thing on thessia
[5:57:14] <critiquequartz> Well the codex explicitly says they don’t do good in full on wars
[5:57:14] <TourettesPlays> Good, you opened this, this isn't acutally Asari Military Command
[5:57:20] <$Futurecity10> I fucking love this character
[5:57:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> You can HEAR the Krogan in her voice
[5:57:22] <%Taisuru> SHE IS SO FUCKING COOL
[5:57:23] <%DashXero> She needed to be in charge of the Asari.
[5:57:24] <%king_wragles> She's my favorite
[5:57:26] <medril07> I like her
[5:57:28] <Chaos_Aether> thats Depressing
[5:57:29] <%king_wragles> @Futurecity10 ayy
[5:57:29] <%maskedsongbird> Aethyta's got the right idea.
[5:57:30] <%patriotrenegade> Hey chat, Google "what do British people call whipped cream"
[5:57:30] <hairtoday> this line is SUPER IMPORTANT for me3's ending
[5:57:30] <%justcallmebobplease> If she got her way the Asari'd be the modern Protheans
[5:57:31] <$Solid_Stro> Damn
[5:57:31] <Jarzard> I want her in the crew
[5:57:33] <+Daigrey> she did the "HOLD THE LINE" pose
[5:57:34] <%heartlesshealer> she's the best asari period
[5:57:34] <StevenNewJersey> "it's rad"
[5:57:35] <%X2Eliah> they can make new mass relays?
[5:57:35] <Dead_Trickster> Best. Matriarch. Ever.
[5:57:36] <+D00msDayDan> that's the best phrase
[5:57:37] <%Dfreddy8> So the Asari are the British?
[5:57:37] <%shadowsofpain> the Baterian systems also got hyper fucked in 3
[5:57:37] <GustauveVIII> wait a minute HER VOICE ACTRESS IS CLAUDIA BLACK
[5:57:38] <%MidnightBurst12> I really like her
[5:57:40] <ioci2112> @ColonelHandzLanza well, isaac newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space
[5:57:41] <%X2Eliah> thats.. kinda huge
[5:57:48] <%Puffen0> you should try getting drunk in this bar chat. nice lil easter egg with the bartender

[5:58:08] <+D00msDayDan> i wanna see an elcor and an asari bone so bad

[5:58:10] <SpaceGuntank> good thing she returns in ME3

[5:58:14] <%AncelDeLambert> The Asari are so good this game, and so not in 3

[5:58:16] <peachy996> Matriarch Aethyta

[5:58:22] <+GingerStrawhat> Shoutouts to all my Farscape pals out there
[5:58:24] <+MrAtheGreat> Well when your primary assault tactics involve espionage it becomes a big hurdle when your enemy is not only espionage immune but also better because they got mind control aura.

[6:04:43] <s1rcuit> is it cheating if they think you're dead?
[6:04:44] <xbb1024> Shepard is gone for 2 YEARS
[6:04:44] <RushUnplugged> she also DOESN'T cheat on you
[6:04:47] <%heartlesshealer> she thought you were whole-ass dead
[6:04:49] <+MrAtheGreat> Shep was FUCKING DEAAAD
[6:04:50] <xeros720> she probably did it for something shadow broker related
[6:04:51] <%spartanghost004> Did she fuck around?
[6:04:51] <James_Quivers> It's weird that Tali and Garrus don't talk here, they're better about this in ME3 tho
[6:04:53] <+Daigrey> WE WERE ON A BREAK
[6:04:55] <$SGrim> @peachy996 So what you're saying is give Wrex a harem. I can dig it.
[6:04:55] <Wolfstriker121> Wait wut.
[6:04:56] <peachy996> I don't think she fucks Ferron anyway
[6:04:58] <critiquequartz> You were hella dead
[6:04:59] <%maskedsongbird> You know what? That's totally fair.
[6:05:01] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Just like Yennefer, right?
[6:05:02] <medril07> corpse for two years
[6:05:03] <Wolfstriker121> What jacob did lol
[6:05:04] <tanarath> shepard was extra crispy
[6:05:04] <%Ranryu692> she gave Cerberus your body to bring you back!
[6:05:06] <%Faustgesicht> You were half a charred corpse on some moon
[6:05:07] <%Puffen0> yeah but it was after she give the body to cerberus to rebuild you. she knew lol
[6:05:10] <captain_kirkhammer> Not only are you dead, she sees your burnt mangled corpse
[6:05:13] <jackelzxaa> it is kind of interesting to do a romance option with jacob where you aren't in control of the relationship as the player
[6:05:16] <FassieFons> but if you un-die then you are un-part
[6:05:16] <%spartanghost004> sit down get up sit down get up
[6:05:16] <blue8moon> it's not cheating if the other person was dead
[6:05:21] <Zalapski> chat, what if pat is just trolling us and makes tali do the ol swan dive in the next game
[6:05:24] <jackelzxaa> as an idea its interesting
[6:05:25] <James_Quivers> She keeps standing and sitting lmao
[6:05:26] <ioci2112> also jacob justifies it by saying a man has needs, like come on dude, you couldn't wait 3 months to get your dick wet
[6:05:28] <critiquequartz> Even if she was responsible for getting your body to give to Cerberus to resurrect you
[6:05:29] <jackelzxaa> pat be careful about liara's wheel
[6:05:29] <iosephe> Just use s DMZ gods
[6:05:31] <+myghtymatt> Now I know how to get of a bad marriage
[6:05:33] <%Dfreddy8> Also that girl is pregnant
[6:05:35] <Wolfstriker121> You was just meat and tube.  How she will make love to that!?!?
[6:05:36] <jackelzxaa> her shadow broker prompt is in this wheel somewheree
[6:05:36] <KeiPrime> that lean in
[6:05:47] <fugly_nick> Jacob is the fuckiing wrost
[6:05:51] <%Puffen0> @blue8moon yeah but it was AFTER she gave the body to cerberus to be rebuilt. she knew
[6:05:52] <tanarath> sex vs. dating is the difference, I think.
[6:05:52] <Pookiedaexzile> There's a hotter version of you here where is she
[6:05:58] <Alzero83> This is Shadow Broker Stuff
[6:06:04] <peachy996> Man it sucks Samara's quest is so...boring. Because Samara herself is really cool
[6:06:08] <jackelzxaa> not yet alzero
[6:06:08] <+DinnerCalzone> she's a jedi
[6:06:08] <FlyguyJP> Asari Judge Dredd
[6:06:12] <+MrAtheGreat> A JEDI you say
[6:06:15] <RushUnplugged> also 2 years vs 3 months, Jacob gets that woman pregnant right away
[6:06:17] <James_Quivers> ASARI WARRIORS DAH NAH NAH NAH
[6:06:18] <jackelzxaa> i'm curious if they changed when it opens up
[6:06:21] <fugly_nick> She's in ME1
[6:06:25] <FassieFons> YEAH, old aliens
[6:06:33] <fugly_nick> Nassana Dantius is a side quest giver in ME1
[6:06:36] <jackelzxaa> i believe the dlc prompt is "Let's go get the shadow broker"
[6:06:37] <Pookiedaexzile> She's what the Asari call a "Reall Freak Bitch"
[6:06:38] <%hat_under_bread> That was a good line.
[6:06:42] <Wolfstriker121> Ooooohhh shit
[6:06:43] <jackelzxaa> it shows up eventually
[6:06:47] <jackelzxaa> yep
[6:06:48] <%Dfreddy8> DON'T
[6:06:50] <FlyguyJP> Drop EVERYTHING
[6:06:52] <+MrAtheGreat> LETS GO GET HIM
[6:06:52] <%pokefan9956> why does she sound so robotic compared to 1
[6:06:54] <stantheman_97> now i will bang tali
[6:06:54] <%X2Eliah> guys pat knows who nassana dantius is
[6:06:54] <aiutare47> Samara is the copiest cop that ever cop’d and very little is done with her quest.
[6:06:57] <%shadowsofpain> ignore it for now
[6:06:58] <srv4254> lets DLC
[6:06:59] <+MrAtheGreat> GOTTA KILL THE SHADOW BROKER
[6:07:03] <mar_krow> jacob bad romance done right or bad ?

[6:08:21] <%spartanghost004> oh hey what happened to the cop
[6:08:22] <Wolfstriker121> C H A O S alll over
[6:08:32] <+D00msDayDan> [biotic charge away]
[6:08:32] <%heartlesshealer> hahaha that's the best holy shit
[6:08:34] <jackelzxaa> lore question: Is Biotic Charge just Okuyasu's The Hand?
[6:08:40] <%Puffen0> NASSANA
[6:09:04] <jackelzxaa> the nassana stuff was some of the first content they showed off in me2
[6:09:04] <+goose_attack_almanac> Its the biotics! Her cthussy going crazy from seeing you alive.
[6:09:08] <%spartanghost004> you see this is why you keep the body with the alliance
[6:09:11] <%X2Eliah> thane is SO COOL
[6:09:13] <jackelzxaa> because they were really proud of bringing back a bit character in a bigger role
[6:09:14] <%cafefunk> cafefunk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hi Pat, i thank you for helping me take pride in my pajama pants, keep being a badass, just please dont litter for fun
[6:09:19] <+DinnerCalzone> Jebaited
[6:09:22] <%pokefan9956> >cthussy
[6:09:23] <fugly_nick> I wonder if there's any Elcor Asari out there
[6:09:23] <jackelzxaa> thane is the best character model in the game
[6:09:23] <BlueLunecy> Imagine thinking anyone could out-tech the fucking GETH.
[6:09:25] <captain_kirkhammer> Alliance tech is absurdly advanced, we just showed up in the galaxy and we seem to be at parity with the toehr factions
[6:09:25] <peachy996> That Salarian is a sidequest
[6:09:30] <jackelzxaa> i think i like thane's model more than wrex
[6:09:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Thane is the shit
[6:09:36] <jackelzxaa> especially in LE
[6:09:41] <peachy996> You find something of is in the mission and give it to him
[6:09:41] <%Parapattern> Beautiful Fish Man
[6:09:51] <+MrAtheGreat> Who said we want to stop him?
[6:09:53] <%embranz> Drell are so fucking cool man
[6:10:01] <jackelzxaa> the thane romance is the most in depth one in the series and is the only one that lets you have "couples chat" with multiple convos
[6:10:06] <%miguelrod777> I doubt that
[6:10:14] <%X2Eliah> well Thane's son is not cool
[6:10:16] <mar_krow> thane the shape of water
[6:10:16] <James_Quivers> This one is part volus, you can tell by the round, gaseous eyes
[6:10:19] <%shadowsofpain> Time to fuck the lizard fish man
[6:10:25] <%Pandybun> @PatStaresAt What's Seryna's dad suppose to be?
[6:10:28] <%X2Eliah> Kolyat is kind of a resalpeenor
[6:10:45] <peachy996> She doesn't have facepaint
[6:10:53] <aiutare47> A whole race of religious slaves and child soldiers, and you only see like two of them in the whole series.
[6:10:58] <peachy996> Odd
[6:10:58] <+D00msDayDan> you know what they say, keep your friends close and your enemies dead
[6:11:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Asari pureblood
[6:11:04] <jackelzxaa> i think it's kind of insane that if shepard shoots the politician in thane's loyalty mission he says "He was a racist" and bailey says "okay good enough for me"
[6:11:14] <%Puffen0> @captain_kirkhammer i would argue that human technology is only more advanced than the turians. just cause of how well they fought in the first contact war. if you played 3 you know why the asari are the most advanced race in the galaxy currently
[6:11:18] <captain_kirkhammer> Nassana's assassination was an inside job! Investigate 3/11!
[6:11:19] <peachy996> Maybe Salarian?
[6:11:34] <medril07> REVENGE
[6:11:34] <%X2Eliah> not enough scales for salarian
[6:11:38] <iosephe> tell me about Thane, why does he wear the mask
[6:11:41] <%X2Eliah> im guessing maybe asari
[6:11:44] <NeroInfinite> Ooh I member thane
[6:11:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Pureblood
[6:11:49] <+MrAtheGreat> Is this a punisher garrus wannabe yeah yawwwwwqn
[6:11:49] <%Puffen0> she's a pureblood
[6:11:53] <NeroInfinite> He's not salarian
[6:11:55] <jackelzxaa> thane has an alternate appearance outfit too
[6:11:57] <NeroInfinite> or asari
[6:11:58] <Wolfstriker121> He’s doing it for the LOLs
[6:12:09] <stantheman_97> what about batarian?
[6:12:09] <Dunmarkh> Battarian
[6:12:13] <wolverinewaswrong> Whoa what happened to Pat Sheps beard?
[6:12:15] <derap41> Asari as a race is fucking scary
[6:12:17] <AussieYak> half varren
[6:12:18] <jackelzxaa> theres an asari with a salarian father in the other shopping center
[6:12:20] <Pookiedaexzile> YOOO
[6:12:21] <aiutare47> I guessed pure blood
[6:12:23] <%machshop> ewwwww
[6:12:23] <critiquequartz> The drell are super rare I’m pretty sure thane explains why and why they don’t leave the hanar home planet
[6:12:25] <+MrAtheGreat> Krogan asari are more flippant like with spine ripping and stuff
[6:12:27] <peachy996> No that Salarian is a good one
[6:12:28] <jackelzxaa> i would be surprised if there are many asari batarians
[6:12:29] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Or Salarian
[6:12:34] <%spartanghost004> poor conrad
[6:12:38] <captain_kirkhammer> How do they know which set of eyes to embrace eternity in?
[6:12:39] <aiutare47> Oh have you spoke to Charr?
[6:12:47] <peachy996> You help that guy later by giving him something you found in thane's mission
[6:12:47] <jackelzxaa> oh yeah the racist asari is over here
[6:12:48] <DSD24> I see a cool Asari over there
[6:12:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Thats scary that they dont LOOK anything like their Fathers. I think they are straight up Sexy Xenomorphs lol
[6:12:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Next Mass Effect game should be All Asari with the ability to choose a different parent for stat buffs
[6:12:51] <critiquequartz> Pls talk to char
[6:12:52] <mar_krow> they can make game show outta who does this asari take after
[6:12:56] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat you should do Liara's side questies
[6:12:57] <RushUnplugged> @wolverinewaswrong it didn't survive the ME1 to 2 conversion
[6:13:00] <jackelzxaa> i think theres a mod that just makes these conversations go until the end on one prompt
[6:13:02] <peachy996> These conversations are the good ones
[6:13:09] <fugly_nick> The wiki says Asari don't take any DNA from their father
[6:13:11] <Zalapski> one of these asari has a batarian father here
[6:13:21] <DSD24> Everything's got a price!
[6:13:26] <FlyguyJP> Juicy juicy TAXES
[6:13:30] <jackelzxaa> asari just have randomized dna that uses the father as a "seed"
[6:13:32] <wolverinewaswrong> @RushUnplugged Dang, same thing happened to my guy, came back in 3 for some reason though
[6:13:36] <Pookiedaexzile> @fugly_nick Its a psychic thing
[6:13:41] <+RaveBV> like cigarettes and many other real world things.
[6:13:41] <derap41> Oh yeah Mercantilism
[6:13:43] <jackelzxaa> it's not their actual dna specifically
[6:13:45] <+MrAtheGreat> ITS ALL IN THE EULA
[6:13:46] <FlyguyJP> You can't say that!
[6:13:47] <+MrAtheGreat> YOOKO
[6:13:48] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[6:13:51] <+MrAtheGreat> YOOOOO
[6:13:53] <+frunkAF> that's racist
[6:13:53] <derap41> HAH Fucking Battarians
[6:13:56] <$realm_forge> They sound like PS5 scalpers
[6:13:57] <%X2Eliah> @fugly_nick eeh, kinda, they use father as basically a re-radomization seed to spice up their dna sequence
[6:13:57] <%AzureGale> DAMN, SON
[6:13:59] <+fromnibelheim> oop!
[6:13:59] <%Bane_Kaikyo> O O O F
[6:14:01] <AussieYak> FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
[6:14:05] <+DinnerCalzone> One of my favorite world building details here is that asari stereotype other asari based on their fathers A LOT, even if they aren't pureblood
[6:14:06] <wolverinewaswrong> This is awkward
[6:14:07] <jackelzxaa> you don't ACTUALLY inseminate an egg for asari
[6:14:08] <+fromnibelheim> the girls are fiiiigghtiinnng!
[6:14:09] <tanarath> SPACIST
[6:14:09] <+D00msDayDan> my father was the only good batarian out there!
[6:14:09] <+MrAtheGreat> Batarian curse.
[6:14:10] <%Parapattern> Now THAT'S Racist
[6:14:10] <derap41> @frunkAF No such thing against Batarians
[6:14:12] <mar_krow> asari kinda like petri dish that needs a seed
[6:14:12] <James_Quivers> RACIST BATARIAN BLOOD
[6:14:13] <%shadowsofpain> genetic evil
[6:14:14] <FlyguyJP> God the Batarian homeworld got the rawest deal
[6:14:14] <aiutare47> Jesus. “Your fathers race is why you’re ok with drugs”
[6:14:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Batarian Blood made her evil
[6:14:18] <+goose_attack_almanac> Are Batarians worse than Ferengi
[6:14:19] <Chaos_Aether> Asari are weird
[6:14:21] <tanarath> INHERITED SPACISM
[6:14:22] <RushUnplugged> there's another bit to that convo
[6:14:23] <karl_rex> BIOCURSE
[6:14:23] <brisk_dacat> dang half blood
[6:14:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Literally
[6:14:23] <+D00msDayDan> the batarian evil
[6:14:25] <wolverinewaswrong> are there female batarians?
[6:14:28] <LluthyY> The tainted blood
[6:14:29] <jackelzxaa> they just self-impregnate after the weird mind sex
[6:14:29] <%AzureGale> Gressy
[6:14:32] <%maskedsongbird> @realm_forge They DO sound like scalpers, don't they?
[6:14:32] <%X2Eliah> Batarians deserve it tho
[6:14:33] <jackelzxaa> oh that asari was green
[6:14:34] <%walternatorz> so that's how they started the aradt yashi or whatever theyre called
[6:14:34] <peachy996> Where is the Salarian one, that conversation hits the hardest
[6:14:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> SHES GREEN
[6:14:37] <+MrAtheGreat> I wanna say they’re given better in ME3 buuuuuuut
[6:14:39] <%crazyspartan214> Salarian
[6:14:39] <NeroInfinite> why she GREEN
[6:14:41] <%king_wragles> Volus father?

[6:15:49] <captain_kirkhammer> her father was mint chocolate chip
[6:15:53] <Pookiedaexzile> So many Character that could be in teh place of the humans on ship
[6:15:53] <jackelzxaa> howcome all of Shiala's clones were born with clothes and guns?
[6:15:58] <$SGrim> @SGrim @king_wragles yes. CarlSmile

[6:16:00] <Broken_Sonex> NICE GRUSSY GIRL
[6:16:06] <wolverinewaswrong> For instance, gunshot wounds from Shepard
[6:16:07] <+MrAtheGreat> You dk get a bonus in ME1 if you save the thorian did you want to know what happens?
[6:16:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Shes a plant PERSON

[6:16:13] <DSD24> Shepard! you can't just say
[6:16:18] <+yunngin> you can't just ask that
[6:16:22] <fugly_nick> "You're green"
[6:16:26] <RushUnplugged> [Empathy: FAILURE] Why are you GREEN?!?
[6:16:29] <+derrigible> omg Pat you can't just ask people why they're green

[6:16:33] <NeroInfinite> Ah.
[6:16:33] <BerryliciousDefinition> Oh my god Shep, you cant just ask people why they're green
[6:16:37] <LluthyY> How could you just ask that??

[6:16:44] <Pookiedaexzile> SHES PART PLANT
[6:16:45] <TheApeGatsby> Wait is she a clone?
[6:16:46] <MildMannered_Creighton> why do all the Asari faces look the same?  did they only want to use one actor?
[6:16:47] <$SGrim> SHE'S SPORE BUTT-PREGNANT
[6:16:48] <%maskedsongbird> "Your face is green."
[6:16:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Why isn't she on my ship
[6:16:53] <%ainzhelm> SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THE WORLD IS GONNA ROLL ME
[6:16:58] <derap41> Hah you fool

[6:17:03] <+FelIian> she hotter green
[6:17:06] <+vaderxyz1970> She's a shiney Asari
[6:17:07] <tranquilturnip> is the clone physiology breaking down?
[6:17:15] <captain_kirkhammer> That's a clear case of contract under duress
[6:17:16] <spuginky> youre green with it
[6:17:18] <%DianaTheAscian> she becoming a plant or something?
[6:17:20] <tranquilturnip> is she stale?
[6:17:21] <%juxtest> "I could go shoot them if you want"
[6:17:23] <+spaceroyalty> why she say ZHU'S HOPE like that
[6:17:26] <%afronooch> Yeah, Green asari are the best
[6:17:27] <derap41> LUL got stuck on medical bills
[6:17:32] <jackelzxaa> y'know what'd look really weird
[6:17:35] <jackelzxaa> human flesh color asari
[6:17:52] <Pookiedaexzile> The thorian literally left a piece of its in her
[6:18:01] <%DianaTheAscian> Red Asari
[6:18:01] <DSD24> Yeah that would be weird
[6:18:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Life....finds a way
[6:18:04] <tranquilturnip> I still don't quite understand why she's green, side effects?
[6:18:06] <peachy996> That's wild when you consider that an asari and salarian are sharing sensations with humans
[6:18:16] <jackelzxaa> everyone in mass effect loves killing
[6:18:20] <arkv01> already huh
[6:18:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Now this is a salarian
[6:18:26] <+JonathLP> Salarian?
[6:18:31] <+MrAtheGreat> THERE WILL BE BLOOD
[6:18:33] <wolverinewaswrong> Asari = Twi'lek?
[6:18:34] <James_Quivers> YAWG
[6:18:36] <derap41> Aliens LUL
[6:18:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah Salarian
[6:18:38] <%barrakuta371> Yeah I see the Turian now
[6:18:39] <%X2Eliah> salarian
[6:18:39] <jackelzxaa> the mercenaries in me2 are almost parody levels of stupid death obsessed
[6:18:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at the face paint
[6:18:46] <Desthanos> So why are we playing "guess the father" with all asari pat?
[6:18:46] <+JonathLP> I think Salarian
[6:18:47] <%maskedsongbird> Sounds about right
[6:18:48] <$SGrim> Facist DNA
[6:18:50] <Dunmarkh> race castesx
[6:18:50] <%miguelrod777> I'm pretty sure she's pure blooded
[6:18:51] <NeroInfinite> Yep.
[6:18:52] <$SGrim> fascist*
[6:18:53] <derap41> Who has the monopoly on Violence?
[6:18:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Salarian
[6:18:58] <jackelzxaa> "Oh so you think all turians are cops?  You humans are all racist!"
[6:18:59] <+JonathLP> Okay, so she's Turian
[6:18:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at the face paint
[6:19:01] <captain_kirkhammer> She doesn;t have face markings
[6:19:02] <%eyezehuhh> on some blue lives ish
[6:19:03] <+MrAtheGreat> Makes sense. Codes are in their blood.
[6:19:07] <%TheYellowcouch> now this is real cop phrenology
[6:19:09] <mar_krow> Asari closer to a petri dish of dna
[6:19:13] <Dunmarkh> Based
[6:19:15] <%Monkeyweed21> RACIST PROFILE PAT
[6:19:16] <%shadowsofpain> Salarian I think
[6:19:22] <FirewallStorm> the facist race
[6:19:23] <%Ranryu692> I think you're assuming she's Turian because of her job
[6:19:25] <+Saggitori> All turians are cops
[6:19:26] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah her dad was a turrian
[6:19:27] <%MidnightBurst12> i'm feeling salarian from her
[6:19:28] <stantheman_97> this planet seems like a asari novaria
[6:19:30] <tranquilturnip> Justicars seem EXTREMELY dangerous
[6:19:31] <%machshop> TRUE
[6:19:32] <jackelzxaa> god the weird attitudes towards the kill stuff
[6:19:32] <James_Quivers> Can you imagine a Vorcha Asari? Good lord.
[6:19:33] <%X2Eliah> Ilove how this game lets us engage in actual phrenology
[6:19:36] <%jillpilled> Only thing Asari and Turians are missing are thumb-like shapes
[6:19:38] <FlyguyJP> Wow. Rude.
[6:19:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait she has shit on her forehead, she might be turian
[6:19:40] <+pally_din> she right tho
[6:19:40] <jackelzxaa> it's so strange considering how serious this game takes itself
[6:19:40] <critiquequartz> Everyone is super afraid of samara and I love it
[6:19:42] <AllenDeadman> is she wrong tho?
[6:19:43] <wolverinewaswrong> Tick tock on Thessia boys
[6:19:44] <captain_kirkhammer> She's right, we have like a thousand religions
[6:19:44] <$SGrim> She's more purple
[6:19:46] <tranquilturnip> Justicars seem like a significantly bigger problem than they are boon
[6:19:46] <NeroInfinite> Hey..you right
[6:19:46] <Broken_Sonex> BUT IT'S TRUE
[6:19:50] <brisk_dacat> we belive in freedom
[6:19:51] <derap41> oh they're inquisitors
[6:19:52] <+D00msDayDan> Lmao that burn
[6:19:53] <jackelzxaa> the me2 attitudes towards murder feel like a joke game but they're in a non joke game
[6:19:56] <huskarl_zap> Cerberus was right
[6:19:56] <%AzureGale> Are justicars like monk cops
[6:20:02] <LeotheHuntsman> D&D Paladins
[6:20:04] <AmuserName> PALADIN PogChamp
[6:20:06] <wolverinewaswrong> The Spectres are all evil except Shepard
[6:20:09] <%cafefunk> Shes right though
[6:20:11] <James_Quivers> So a cult
[6:20:13] <%X2Eliah> Justicars are authorized BY THE GODDESS
[6:20:15] <iosephe> THE LAW
[6:20:16] <%maskedsongbird> "From no blue lady." And so the Xenos racism begins. We just need the Imperium to show up and purge the stream of this heresy...
[6:20:16] <%ainzhelm> Learn to code
[6:20:17] <BlindGato> Samurai?

[6:20:40] <derap41> Asari is theocracy fucking crazy
[6:20:41] <logothete2401> Asari society seems completely incomprehensible
[6:20:42] <jackelzxaa> imagine if there was just a job you could get as a human where you could kill anyone including politicians and everyone would go "Well, they are a justicar"
[6:20:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah he's right Turian
[6:20:45] <critiquequartz> They’re Jedi they have to give up everything
[6:20:46] <captain_kirkhammer> @TheYellowcouch Justicars follow jusitce, not law

[6:37:09] <logothete2401> the salarians have it fucking rough
[6:37:09] <%spartanghost004> The dads will just keep dropping like flies
[6:37:09] <+frunkAF> asari have a raw deal
[6:37:12] <jackelzxaa> behind you
[6:37:13] <tranquilturnip> its beautiful how much he cares and you can tell she cares too
[6:37:14] <%Puffen0> hacking hackers man
[6:37:17] <jackelzxaa> theres one
[6:37:18] <+Punchasaur> if i was a salarian i'd be close to dead NotLikeThis
[6:37:18] <%maskedsongbird> Every time I hear it, I actually have to step back and wipe away tears.
[6:37:19] <Desthanos> That's the same voice actor for those two Salarian NPC's
[6:37:19] <jackelzxaa> hack terminal
[6:37:20] <leinadtonu> now I'm sad
[6:37:20] <SpaceGuntank> they bring up the Lifespan talk a lot in mass effect
[6:37:22] <hairtoday> WORLDBUILDING
[6:37:24] <%DianaTheAscian> being a Asari must suck ass
[6:37:26] <derap41> Asari are fucked up they legit will take over the galaxy
[6:37:28] <aiutare47> 1 asari will see 25 GENERATIONS of Salarians.
[6:37:28] <%machshop> they're all hot
[6:37:29] <%Reveresao> You wanna fuck them
[6:37:32] <%Puffen0> not totally wrong
[6:37:33] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> HACK THE PLANET
[6:37:35] <M0untain_wolf> Asari are the teacher and the 'pets'
[6:37:37] <%AncelDeLambert> they're elves
[6:37:44] <%cvp5127> the milf race
[6:37:48] <%maskedsongbird> Space elves
[6:37:48] <mighty_fine_trousers> Right Pat never played ME3 huh
[6:37:53] <%shadowsofpain> yeah basically
[6:37:55] <peachy996> Salarian-Asari relationships are just doomed to tragedy
[6:37:55] <logothete2401> Asari society is incomprehensible
[6:37:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Not tis not
[6:37:57] <Broken_Sonex> Pace Elf basically
[6:37:59] <+JonathLP> Space Elf Milfs
[6:37:59] <BlueLunecy> Asari are super interesting when they aren't stuck up their own asses
[6:38:00] <Broken_Sonex> space*
[6:38:00] <jackelzxaa> it's like pet ownership.  you know you're going to outlive it but you do it anyways because it's worth the time you share
[6:38:01] <derap41> @AncelDeLambert Horny blue space elves...wait a minute
[6:38:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Its Stagnant to us
[6:38:04] <$SGrim> They're a race of magic space republicans cmonBruh
[6:38:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Based on our time
[6:38:07] <%maskedsongbird> @cvp5127 God dammit, you made me do a spit take
[6:38:09] <FlyguyJP> I think I remember part of the lore is the problem that they overspecialized to the point of obsession and ruin themselves
[6:38:09] <leinadtonu> Maybe they see it differently.
[6:38:10] <%Puffen0> use sound
[6:38:12] <peachy996> Think about what 20 years is like for an asari
[6:38:15] <+Bail_Seven> stagnent culture would be the best
[6:38:15] <mighty_fine_trousers> Some interesting convos in ME3
[6:38:18] <%baronouroboros> Why don't salarians cyborgize? Or like anyone else? Mass Effect has bad anti-dying technology
[6:38:21] <$Solid_Stro> And marrying each other has the off chance of birthing psychopaths
[6:38:22] <jackelzxaa> i think theres more than one in this room
[6:38:25] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, I guess there's not much of an impetus for innovation when you live for a millennia (or more)
[6:38:30] <+MrAtheGreat> I mean Krogan’s were so strong they needed to be nerfed in the balls.
[6:38:32] <%AzureGale> Pat Shepard playing IT support
[6:38:33] <jackelzxaa> iirc theres supposed to be three terminals
[6:38:36] <%justcallmebobplease> How did the Asari get to space first this cycle, with such long-life-based-stagnation, and the baked in Ardat Yakshi issue from when they couldn't get at aliens to breed with?
[6:38:40] <%baronouroboros> Mass effect has bad anti-dying tech, ngl
[6:38:43] <%Puffen0> theres like 3 or 4 iirc
[6:38:44] <%baronouroboros> Unless you're Shepard
[6:38:46] <%X2Eliah> yeah theres more
[6:38:49] <jackelzxaa> pat
[6:38:50] <%X2Eliah> all in this room
[6:38:52] <jackelzxaa> the other one
[6:38:52] <James_Quivers> There's another one here, tv
[6:38:53] <%X2Eliah> PAT
[6:38:57] <FlyguyJP> @MrAtheGreat You're not wrong. Krogans were a literal invasive species
[6:38:59] <anAngryHamster> The salarians didn't have a name for it until humans told them about Doppler
[6:39:01] <%X2Eliah> ALL NODES WERE IN THAT ROOM
[6:39:01] <M0untain_wolf> mmm Neral scarrring
[6:39:02] <jackelzxaa> you have to watch the prompt at the top of the screen for "hack terminal"
[6:39:04] <mar_krow> what will you have after 500 years
[6:39:08] <%maskedsongbird> I'm surprised we haven't overheard the Blasto adverts yet.
[6:39:09] <$Futurecity10> Also Prothean
[6:39:09] <derap41> @baronouroboros Because if you go down that line you just end up with reapers again. Like these societies cannot be around at the same time as the singularity
[6:39:09] <%shadowsofpain> I'm honestly excited for Pat reaction to the parts of 3 that weren't memed into public conscience
[6:39:13] <%maenos2> you learn in me3 the asari were intended to be leaders by the protheans
[6:39:14] <%miguelrod777> you find out how in 3
[6:39:16] <peachy996> And help from Protheans
[6:39:17] <%Puffen0> they explain it in 3. no spoilers
[6:39:17] <FennecZephyr> They were also sorta uplifted by the protheans
[6:39:17] <%X2Eliah> there's like 3 total
[6:39:18] <+DinnerCalzone> Mmmm there's some details in ME3 that kind of answer that
[6:39:18] <alextrebeken> you also have racist grandma for a while
[6:39:18] <$SGrim> @baronouroboros The reasoning is that their brain is the first organ to begin failing. Having brain death as a racial trait makes most cyborgs pointless.
[6:39:20] <$Solid_Stro> That’s kinda answered in 3
[6:39:22] <%afronooch> a lot of the asari stuff gets explained in 3
[6:39:22] <+GamerWorlock> Answered in ME3
[6:39:23] <blackjack8182> The Protheians
[6:39:26] <M0untain_wolf> Asymmetrical scapls
[6:39:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt oh man ME3  has some good shit for the asari
[6:39:30] <BlindGato> The Asari we're the Protheans favorite
[6:39:30] <Desthanos> That and they had Prothean Tech on their homeworld so they had a jump in their tech.
[6:39:31] <+Bail_Seven> chill with me3 spoilers guys
[6:39:31] <%justcallmebobplease> ...Yeah, I guess they can get like, entire generations of peak performance out of techs and have like, personage-driven tech renaissances.
[6:39:33] <+D00msDayDan> Imagine where we’d be if Einstein could live a thousand years
[6:39:35] <Pookiedaexzile> "Oh wow.....did you make that yourself....how'd you make that space faring ship"
[6:39:37] <%juxtest> The Asari planet has a spaceship and a Xenophilia And You book on it
[6:39:39] <+MrAtheGreat> Makes sense. Their only competitor in that regard would be krogans and they lived on a hostile planet.
[6:39:40] <jackelzxaa> liara will message you when yuou're done hacking
[6:39:48] <%Cozy90> wait was that Dax's voice from DS9?
[6:39:48] <%cafefunk> I wouldnt mind living for 1000 👀
[6:39:50] <%Puffen0> psaBlind rllyBlind
[6:39:55] <ScreamLord> Asari/Asari couples and pureblood children are stigmatized because of the Ardact-Yakshi, and 90% of species live less than a 10th of their average lifespan. Asari love lives suck
[6:39:58] <derap41> Asari were literal fuck dolls for the Protheans
[6:39:59] <M0untain_wolf> Genetic races
[6:40:09] <%AncelDeLambert> doo doo doo doo
[6:40:11] <+D00msDayDan> hell imagine where we'd be if einstein, newton, tesla, and the wright brothers could live a thousand years
[6:40:11] <%TheYellowcouch> RUN SHEPARD
[6:40:14] <NeroInfinite> I dunno living for 1000 years seems kinda...not great.
[6:40:16] <jackelzxaa> one more
[6:40:26] <%Puffen0> @cafefunk i would. sounds boring if youre stuck here on earth ngl
[6:40:27] <%baronouroboros> 2000's era Space Neoliberalism
[6:40:28] <%X2Eliah> pat
[6:40:32] <FlyguyJP> Well getting shot to death works just fine on an Asari just as a human
[6:40:33] <%baronouroboros> That's mass effect lol
[6:40:34] <derap41> @NeroInfinite better than not living for 1000 years
[6:40:35] <%X2Eliah> pat are you trolling right now
[6:40:38] <jackelzxaa> i'm pretty sure the third one is in that room too
[6:40:39] <aiutare47> Fun fact: Asari have a direct democracy. They vote and debate in internet chat rooms with AI moderators. @patstaresat
[6:40:40] <%Puffen0> yes
[6:40:41] <M0untain_wolf> "WHOO READ LABLES?"
[6:40:42] <peachy996> I dunno. It sounds pretty boss to me
[6:40:43] <Dunmarkh> yes
[6:40:44] <%X2Eliah> YES
[6:40:49] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[6:40:51] <xbb1024> If everybody lived that long, you wouldn't even notice it
[6:40:52] <%machshop> BLASTO
[6:40:52] <Latija> BLASTO
[6:40:54] <chancho4tierra> yes
[6:40:56] <SpaceGuntank> BLASTO!
[6:40:57] <Afterman_> idk if you live for 1000 years imagine how that would fuck with your brain and your perception of time
[6:40:57] <+Punchasaur> @baronouroboros salarians live to 40 even WITH lifespan extensions
[6:40:57] <FassieFons> BLASTO
[6:40:58] <+GamerWorlock> You'd at least live threw one space war
[6:40:59] <+FelIian> no
[6:41:00] <%maskedsongbird> Living for 1000 years is only good if you keep the youth and mental longevity to go with it.
[6:41:03] <wolverinewaswrong> vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
[6:41:04] <arkv01> yeah maybe those batarians huh
[6:41:04] <M0untain_wolf> Hell yeah Blasto!

[6:41:08] <BurdRightsActivist> BATARIAN FATHER
[6:41:15] <%Parapattern> It's all relative. What if there was a race that lived 10,000 years?
[6:41:17] <derap41> What Asari would even fuck a Batarian
[6:41:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Imagine being old and having to deal with a catheter for like the last 80 or 90 years of your life @PatStaresAt
[6:41:21] <peachy996> That makes the Salarian one rough. He has Alzheimers
[6:41:22] <Pookiedaexzile> This is what they do between orgies
[6:41:26] <%Puffen0> @Punchasaur yup
[6:41:29] <M0untain_wolf> RUN!!

[6:41:58] <jackelzxaa> because liara's a renegade
[6:42:00] <Latija> its illegal
[6:42:01] <ScreamLord> Illigal hacking
[6:42:03] <SpaceGuntank> BECAUSE CRIME
[6:42:03] <+MrAtheGreat> You did crimes man
[6:42:04] <%Puffen0> stealing info maybe?
[6:42:05] <%juxtest> shadow borker
[6:42:07] <%heartlesshealer> crime
[6:42:09] <FlyguyJP> @derap41 Mercs fuck too you know. And Batarians are like the main mercs
[6:42:09] <+Grayhammatter> illegal
[6:42:10] <NeroInfinite> illegal ahcks
[6:42:10] <jackelzxaa> hacking is a crime
[6:42:11] <$Solid_Stro> Imagine living through the Spanish flu and then COVID happens and you’re like “Oh this shit again.”
[6:42:12] <FassieFons> cuz you did crimes for your ex
[6:42:14] <+ratchetex> oh nooooo
[6:42:16] <M0untain_wolf> Very illegal
[6:42:17] <+MrAtheGreat> You’re compromised man!!
[6:42:19] <Latija> slavery is legal but hacking isn't apparently
[6:42:21] <mar_krow> asari go to school for how long
[6:42:25] <%Bane_Kaikyo> SeemsGood502 I would totally buy Char's Mix Tape, That Krogan had B A R S.... Also I am a huge fan of how you can tell Who an Asari's Father was. I'm so glad you brought that up cause now it's all I can think of when an Asari is on the screen. Love details like that in games, it's great.
[6:42:25] <M0untain_wolf> But for dat sweet blue
[6:42:26] <iosephe> it's illegal to do crimes
[6:42:26] <ScreamLord> Liara made you do crimes
[6:42:31] <%Puffen0> ah shucks, too bad im a specter above ALL LAWS
[6:42:35] <BurdRightsActivist> Not for long 4Head
[6:42:36] <derap41> @FlyguyJP Yeah but what Asari would bed down with a Batarian merc
[6:42:37] <M0untain_wolf> long enough
[6:42:38] <FlyguyJP> They never stop.
[6:42:39] <arkv01> forever
[6:42:42] <%Puffen0> maybe like, 30 years
[6:42:46] <bluespams7> You get random renegade points sometimes
[6:42:49] <+Punchasaur> long enough to be hell
[6:42:51] <NeroInfinite> A loong time
[6:42:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Stop thinking about Asari School girls
[6:42:53] <ScreamLord> 50 years?
[6:42:55] <+D00msDayDan> god imagine 12 years of high school
[6:42:55] <%MelBrooksKA> probably decades
[6:42:58] <jackelzxaa> i imagine normal school is about the same but college is super long
[6:43:00] <xbb1024> Until they are mentally matured
[6:43:00] <HaroldDonchee> asari don't go to school. they just toss them in strip clubs and say figure it out
[6:43:07] <FlyguyJP> @derap41 A fellow merc. Bored or grew attached from working jobs together.
[6:43:07] <%machshop> lmao
[6:43:09] <%OldOnyx> the 60yr was talking like she was just out of school
[6:43:10] <M0untain_wolf> damnit PAT
[6:43:13] <Desthanos> Illusive man says hi.
[6:43:22] <%afronooch> didnt liara start going on digs and stuff in like her 70s?
[6:43:23] <%Puffen0> also, are all the years in mass effect based off of earth time? if so thats odd
[6:43:33] <derap41> @FlyguyJP Why are you trying to push Batarian Asari love so much its inpure
[6:43:35] <%Puffen0> DESKCHAN
[6:43:35] <M0untain_wolf> wow Liara
[6:43:35] <%machshop> deskchan
[6:43:36] <FlyguyJP> AGGRESSIVE TABLE SLAP
[6:43:44] <M0untain_wolf> what if
[6:43:45] <Justlaxy> I can't unhear lightning dang.
[6:43:47] <wolverinewaswrong> This subplot came out of nowehere
[6:43:48] <M0untain_wolf> I KILL HIM??
[6:43:56] <%Cozy90> She needs to eat him. TO GAIN HIS POWER
[6:44:01] <FlyguyJP> The "We'll Bang, OK" Button
[6:44:04] <Jaysky> Desk-kun lost HP. Also stop standing up Liara.
[6:44:05] <jackelzxaa> as far as i know, asari bodies age about the same rate as humans do, but they just have cultural views on maturity
[6:44:06] <derap41> And she stands up again
[6:44:08] <ScreamLord> That one Asari talking to the Salrian at the weapon shop mentions being 50 or 60 and "Finally moving away from her parents" so 50-ish years of school sounds right
[6:44:08] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[6:44:09] <%machshop> she's upset
[6:44:10] <HaroldDonchee> Holy shit just sit down
[6:44:10] <hairtoday> stand up DRAMATICALLY
[6:44:13] <vomitandroid> for emphasis
[6:44:13] <M0untain_wolf> So excited
[6:44:14] <Latija> she's a pacer
[6:44:15] <FlyguyJP> For drama.
[6:44:15] <+yunngin> it's a serious response she has to stand
[6:44:16] <%TheYellowcouch> Let a girl stand Pat!
[6:44:17] <James_Quivers> She's on that RED SAND
[6:44:17] <peachy996> Cuz Bioware
[6:44:17] <+MrAtheGreat> SO SHE CAN DO THE TURN
[6:44:19] <%Xelhesia> lol
[6:44:20] <Jaysky> For EMPHASIS
[6:44:21] <%eyezehuhh> "friend"
[6:44:21] <ShamanKing0811> She angy
[6:44:21] <derap41> good core training
[6:44:22] <%MelBrooksKA> Standing table\
[6:44:23] <+Punchasaur> theyhave galactic standard years iirc
[6:44:24] <+Grayhammatter> dramatics
[6:44:26] <brisk_dacat> she got back problems
[6:44:28] <%Puffen0> @wolverinewaswrong this and the arrival dlc are supposed to be direct tie ins to ME3
[6:44:31] <intestinal_bleeding> *mind turn*
[6:44:31] <peachy996> You don't notice they all do that in 2? Aria did that earlier
[6:44:34] <leinadtonu> to make a point
[6:44:39] <%Puffen0> also, are all the years in mass effect based off of earth time? if so thats odd
[6:44:41] <%OldOnyx> do asari just hate talking while seated
[6:44:43] <%X2Eliah> Hmm she should have another sidequest
[6:44:43] <jackelzxaa> she has a second hacking quest
[6:44:46] <%Cozy90> asari are notorious for back problems
[6:44:48] <M0untain_wolf> Exa derrmaa
[6:44:49] <+JonathLP> Go to the bar
[6:44:49] <jackelzxaa> but you can do that later
[6:44:50] <%X2Eliah> Its weird that it didnt pop in
[6:44:53] <%juxtest> She has important shadow broking to do
[6:44:55] <FlyguyJP> STONKS
[6:45:02] <%X2Eliah> oh ok
[6:45:05] <Pookiedaexzile> SEE THIEY ADMIT IT
[6:45:06] <mesamus> pat the bar
[6:45:07] <HaroldDonchee> stretch your legs to show dominance
[6:45:07] <%RAWPowerStudios> I just opened a stream where a woman is farting into a microphone for over 2 hours.  1 sub for 30 seconds.  What is happening.
[6:45:08] <M0untain_wolf> OH YES
[6:45:09] <%Puffen0> STONKS
[6:45:11] <Pookiedaexzile> THEY USE BIOTICS TO LOOK LIKE US

[6:46:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> LIKE A LIL PUPPY
[6:46:55] <BurdRightsActivist> Actual puppy
[6:46:56] <%X2Eliah> So Shepard basically just encourages conrad's BS
[6:46:57] <tranquilturnip> He really just wants to make a difference and be a big hero man
[6:46:58] <ianabstract> does the bartender have anything to say
[6:46:59] <%juxtest> Shepard knows a terrorist when he sees one, because hes a terrorist too
[6:47:01] <%Puffen0> that was so sweet
[6:47:01] <tanarath> GASLIGHT FOR BIG PARAGON
[6:47:02] <ScreamLord> Fun Fact: Canrad has a doctorate in Quantum Physics and Dark Matter
[6:47:04] <mar_krow> pat is an enabler
[6:47:04] <LeotheHuntsman> I hope that man dies a real hero in ME3
[6:47:05] <peachy996> "Conrad did good?"
[6:47:06] <Pookiedaexzile> @Broken_Sonex "Do you use Biotics to touch things up", Getting Drunk  changes what tehy look like, All aliens think they loook like them.  Biotic brainwashing all of it
[6:47:08] <%ainzhelm> You still should have shot him
[6:47:11] <+Punchasaur> you just enabled an inept vigilante
[6:47:12] <FlyguyJP> That was renegade for giving him false hope on not being a failure
[6:47:16] <tranquilturnip> inspire heroism
[6:47:16] <bluespams7> How is that paragon that’s just gaslighting LUL
[6:47:19] <%YakumoYomi> Ferret skewers? Hot diggity!
[6:47:21] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah they noce
[6:47:25] <%Puffen0> that was awesome n gl
[6:47:28] <jackelzxaa> you CAN do the liara thing now but you don't have to
[6:47:30] <tranquilturnip> We like this universe too much
[6:47:31] <%TheYellowcouch> But it's so much fun to tell them all to shut up and cram them in a locker!!!
[6:47:32] <aiutare47> Doesn’t he give like only 5 readiness in ME3
[6:47:32] <peachy996> It's hard to be mean to characters you like talking to
[6:47:32] <Latija> what about jacob?
[6:47:33] <tranquilturnip> its too pure
[6:47:38] <RushUnplugged> Bioware plots can be bad, but character writing is usually great
[6:47:43] <%X2Eliah> jacob sucks
[6:47:46] <derap41> No one likes Jacob
[6:47:47] <blackjack8182> Except Jacob
[6:47:50] <+Punchasaur> he's gonna get himself shot
[6:47:50] <tranquilturnip> LUL
[6:47:55] <derap41> At least Ashley is racist
[6:47:57] <ShamanKing0811> Jacob ResidentSleeper
[6:47:58] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[6:47:59] <%YakumoYomi> "Fuck Jacob. Jacob's garbage."
[6:47:59] <M0untain_wolf> I mean you cann kll them
[6:47:59] <tanarath> Jacob is such garbage
[6:47:59] <QuestlordJake> :(
[6:48:00] <Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile Never understood the drinking and get drunk make them change part
[6:48:00] <%X2Eliah> Every single suggestion Jacob makes is wrong
[6:48:00] <derap41> jacobs got nothign
[6:48:01] <+robosqueeb> jacobs an alright guy tho
[6:48:01] <tranquilturnip> Jacob is the tack holding the poster you like on the wall
[6:48:04] <%Puffen0> i like jacob....
[6:48:05] <%casualbaloth> just got to the part in the podcast this week where you guys talked about david cage, fuck that guy and i'm glad other people can finally see that he sucks shit
[6:48:06] <%Shubreaker> inshallah
[6:48:11] <FlyguyJP> Does Ashley's new boobs make up for the racism?
[6:48:12] <%RAWPowerStudios> My name is Jacob I'm using this sound clip as a ringtone
[6:48:13] <%shadowsofpain> I think even Ashley lovers hate Jacob
[6:48:17] <FeralFozzie> and the fish lived for another day
[6:48:18] <leinadtonu> poor Jacob
[6:48:18] <%heartlesshealer> Jacob is not alright if you're femshep
[6:48:19] <s1rcuit> feed the biotic damage research to the fish
[6:48:22] <%ainzhelm> Someone on the dev team really likes Jacob
[6:48:25] <peachy996> Ashley is better in death than in life. Jacob sucks either way
[6:48:26] <+robosqueeb> Jacob just didn't have an interesting enough story compared to other teammates
[6:48:26] <RushUnplugged> Jacob really feels like an afterthought because they needed another char, and they added a black guy for brownie points
[6:48:27] <mighty_fine_trousers> Is he gonna custom the new gear he bought?
[6:48:29] <aiutare47> Miranda isn’t compelling and Jack’s a borderline parody while we’re at it.
[6:48:29] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Poor Jacob
[6:48:31] <homestylewaffles> feesh
[6:48:34] <%Puffen0> you gotta bang Kelly on the side to keep the fish
[6:48:43] <Teras_ode> but isn't Ash already dead? Kappa
[6:48:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Kinda messed up they make the brother a cheater
[6:48:45] <ShiningAxis> I have killed more fish than I have geth
[6:48:49] <derap41> @RushUnplugged ..phrasing
[6:48:50] <jackelzxaa> when giant bomb played the mass effect trilogy alex navarro got tali killed in the suicide mission and vinny used a save editor to bring her back for 3 and just said "Oh, Cerberus had a Lazerus Project 2.  Tali's back!"
[6:48:51] <+Punchasaur> wait ashley got new boobs
[6:48:55] <Broken_Sonex> Shit like this needs to be in more games
[6:48:56] <vile_brand> hamster?
[6:49:01] <FlyguyJP> Nerd Helmet
[6:49:02] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Conrad has a sister you can meet in Andromeda and she thinks he's an asshole
[6:49:07] <jackelzxaa> i always put a visor on cuz the stats are worth it
[6:49:10] <Sol_Install> oh fish story
[6:49:10] <peachy996> Where's the Evil Helmet
[6:49:11] <%Pandybun> But you look like you are the law
[6:49:11] <jackelzxaa> kstral is great
[6:49:14] <+Punchasaur> i guess shes morally grey nowe
[6:49:15] <%Puffen0> its so you can go renegade and still eat out that QURUSSY
[6:49:18] <HaroldDonchee> why are they all so shitty. there were Ike 2 cool ones
[6:49:22] <RushUnplugged> @peachy996 quite literally, they give Ashley a medal and use out of context quotes to make her sound better, she's literally better off dead
[6:49:23] <Broken_Sonex> Recon mask is pretty cool though
[6:49:25] <derap41> THICC
[6:49:29] <%ainzhelm> @screamlord Another reason andromeda is a shit game
[6:49:29] <+ScrapKingKeita> I've been learning a lot about fish lately in preparation for an aquarium and the amount of love people put into caring for their fish is incredible. Like, getting your gold fish to live for 25 years looks like a trip
[6:49:31] <aiutare47> The kestrel visor is dorky but the armor is legit the best in the game.
[6:49:31] <FennecZephyr> Oh yeah, the kestrel armor is probably the best armor in the game
[6:49:31] <+nepetuna> oh god i forgot that armor is sliders in this
[6:49:32] <ScreamLord> Best set in the game
[6:49:34] <%X2Eliah> Kestrel is basically ME3 armour
[6:49:34] <jackelzxaa> put the scouter on
[6:49:41] <FennecZephyr> I only wish it didn't cover your eyes
[6:49:45] <jackelzxaa> the scouter makes you look like a bigger asshole
[6:49:47] <%machshop> got a decent bulge, too
[6:49:48] <ScreamLord> @ainzhelm lol
[6:49:50] <%Ranryu692> yeah, the Kestrel set is the only good armor set lol
[6:49:59] <derap41> Visor is alright
[6:50:01] <jackelzxaa> space man
[6:50:05] <jackelzxaa> look at that space asshole
[6:50:10] <+nepetuna> why is color a slider
[6:50:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Ha you got LEDS
[6:50:14] <Corgifist> Kestrel was what most of my armour ended up being in ME2, especially since it's bulkier look fits a Soldier so good
[6:50:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Hot pink you coward
[6:50:15] <$Futurecity10> with this armour and a fully upgraded AR, you can mag dump into Harbinger and kill him in half a clip
[6:50:18] <peachy996> @RushUnplugged And you don't have to look at her bad redesign in 3 or listen to her bitch at you about Cerberus
[6:50:23] <stormhawk9891> Kuwashii visor actually looks pretty cool not gonna lie
[6:50:27] <mar_krow> pink
[6:50:27] <derap41> Look at them giant shoulder plates
[6:50:27] <peachy996> Win/Win
[6:50:29] <%juxtest> Conrad, what does the Scouter say about his Paragon level?
[6:50:30] <jackelzxaa> in me3 you can change the color of your glow lights or turn them off
[6:50:32] <FennecZephyr> I always go for red
[6:50:33] <+kekkerscrew> Does Legendary have the DLC armor
[6:50:33] <%heartlesshealer> boo no searing neon
[6:50:38] <FennecZephyr> Char Aznable red
[6:50:41] <%Puffen0> remake the phoenix armor from 1
[6:50:42] <mighty_fine_trousers> Would max cooldown let you charge around with impunity?
[6:50:43] <Pookiedaexzile> He's about be Captain America
[6:50:44] <aiutare47> If you’re into armor aesthetics you gotta get one of the Ajax recolor mods for ME3
[6:50:46] <%X2Eliah> @kekkerscrew yep
[6:50:48] <Corgifist> @Futurecity10 Dude, Armour-piercing Ammo plus the Revenant is so fuckin MONEY
[6:50:52] <huskarl_zap> dirty ass grey
[6:50:54] <jackelzxaa> i like to go black armor with orange and white on the other colors to look all cerberusy
[6:50:55] <mar_krow> ashley colors for a second
[6:51:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> boo
[6:51:06] <+Punchasaur> avengers endgame suit
[6:51:07] <$Futurecity10> Mattock is better
[6:51:08] <jackelzxaa> oh man those were the me3 versions of those armors
[6:51:12] <%Puffen0> blood dragon is my fav armor in the game
[6:51:13] <jackelzxaa> i could tell by the spec maps

[6:52:38] <GandhiTheTerrible> bye pat
[6:52:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Sol Noguy
[6:52:45] <James_Quivers> Pat, i know you wanna bring legion to tali's loyalty mission, but does that give you enough time to romance her?
[6:53:13] <%MidnightBurst12> that's fucked
[6:53:21] <%heartlesshealer> hmm
[6:53:25] <%OldOnyx> ...interesting
[6:53:25] <RushUnplugged> it's only bugged for the achievement, but it counts for the actual game
[6:53:26] <tanarath> huh?
[6:53:30] <peachy996> Damn Shepherd? Why are your fingers purple and blue?
[6:53:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Sequence breaking romance yeah!
[6:53:33] <jackelzxaa> oh so you know about the romance glitch, pat?
[6:53:37] <James_Quivers> Oh damn
[6:53:40] <ScreamLord> Pat's the kind of guy who's play his Switch with half the controller in each hand while veg'ing out on the couch
[6:53:42] <%X2Eliah> hmm can you... interesting
[6:53:46] <jackelzxaa> this lets you see all 3 of them yeah
[6:53:46] <+D00msDayDan> do you still get the sex scene though?
[6:53:53] <jackelzxaa> you can do miranda, then jack, then finish with tali to see them all
[6:53:54] <%shadowsofpain> huh
[6:53:58] <blackjack8182> Be careful with The IFF
[6:54:13] <jackelzxaa> miranda for boobs, jack for sads, tali for qussy
[6:54:19] <%shadowsofpain> do you still get the Qussy cutscene?
[6:54:26] <%X2Eliah> allrighty, so pat has a plan, good
[6:54:32] <Broken_Sonex> @jackelzxaa Miranda for *ass
[6:54:55] <peachy996> yeah Jack's romance is more emotional than sex
[6:54:59] <%YakumoYomi> WAQ=Wet alien qussy
[6:55:03] <%KaiserMario> So you already made the decision to steal Garrus's happiness... Poor bird-alien-man-cop
[6:55:08] <ChocolateMoofin> Did I miss who he decided yet? Romance wise?
[6:55:10] <peachy996> Garrus is disappointly chaste
[6:55:22] <Corgifist> There's a mission/squad order post on reddit that's INSANE, they say to do Arrival and Lair of the Shadow Broker AFTER HORIZON
[6:55:25] <$SGrim> @ChocolateMoofin Tali
[6:55:25] <jackelzxaa> pat are you planning to do all 3 romances and just finish on tali for the import?
[6:55:38] <+MasterDecoder> @kaisermario he’ll be fine
[6:55:41] <ChocolateMoofin> Heck yes!
[6:55:42] <Corgifist> @KaiserMario Garrus can still be happy without Tali, it's a lame forced pairing anyway
[6:55:48] <+nepetuna> wait can you not get with garrus
[6:56:02] <jackelzxaa> it works for the n7 missions too actually
[6:56:04] <%X2Eliah> ok
[6:56:07] <jackelzxaa> any mission at all will do it
[6:56:08] <ChocolateMoofin> Garrus is straight only I believe
[6:56:08] <%X2Eliah> good plan
[6:56:11] <peachy996> Not as a man sadly
[6:56:15] <RushUnplugged> Firewalker is basically pointless, there's really no plot
[6:56:15] <James_Quivers> Lair is great in postgame too
[6:56:16] <%Ranryu692> Overlord is cool until it gets offensive
[6:56:21] <blackjack8182> Smart

[6:56:25] <jackelzxaa> you can romance the other characters and then dump them for tali in the postgame and have a clean save file
[6:56:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @nepetuna only ladies can get the turian dick
[6:56:33] <ScreamLord> In want playable Geth in ME4
[6:56:35] <peachy996> stupid Bioware not letting Garrus calibrate my Thanix Cannon
[6:56:37] <ChocolateMoofin> Overlord is offensive?
[6:56:45] <jackelzxaa> yeah
[6:56:51] <jackelzxaa> you can get jack for the suicide mission and tali for after
[6:56:55] <jackelzxaa> yeah
[6:56:55] <Virokwet> i doubt that
[6:56:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I wouldnt so that
[6:56:56] <%machshop> yes
[6:57:01] <$SGrim> Like you should, yes
[6:57:02] <Broken_Sonex> So Jack then Miranda then Tali to see them all
[6:57:02] <James_Quivers> TALI SUPREMACY IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE GAME
[6:57:03] <%TheYellowcouch> sounds appropriate
[6:57:05] <tattleworm> yeah, my original femshep basically celebrated with a fuckfest after the relay
[6:57:08] <blackjack8182> Risky
[6:57:19] <%heartlesshealer> but did they fix it
[6:57:19] <%rockcentuar> yes
[6:57:20] <%Monkeyweed21> I banged Kelly and then let her die in the collector base so I could bang Tali @PatStaresAt
[6:57:21] <jackelzxaa> hahahaha
[6:57:23] <%TheYellowcouch> ME GIRL
[6:57:25] <%AzureGale> LUL
[6:57:26] <%shadowsofpain> @chocolatemoofin It's not kind to autism
[6:57:31] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[6:57:32] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[6:57:32] <blackjack8182> You can break up with her right after the SM
[6:57:34] <+Punchasaur> thats based
[6:57:34] <%Xelhesia> TALI IS THE ONLY TRUTH
[6:57:35] <ChocolateMoofin> Telling Tali you'll get her a house is so wholesome guys
[6:57:35] <$SGrim> @Monkeyweed21 strats
[6:57:35] <James_Quivers> Heavy risk, but the priiize
[6:57:36] <%maskedsongbird> Going full-on Kirk wit it, huh?
[6:57:40] <%Maids4lyfe> wow
[6:57:41] <%YakumoYomi> @tattleworm LUL LUL LUL
[6:57:42] <critiquequartz> Yeah overlord isn’t great
[6:57:46] <tranquilturnip> the Haremandy
[6:57:49] <RushUnplugged> there's some icky about the kid in Overlord being autistic, but it's less the "autism superpower" trope and more him being an actual freak
[6:57:54] <Corgifist> @Monkeyweed21 You killed Kelly for no reason, she doesn't count as a full romance and doesn't lock you in or anything
[6:57:59] <ChocolateMoofin> @shadowsofpain you are absolutely right omg
[6:58:06] <%ramielthe5th> ramielthe5th subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! fun stream, thanks Pat!
[6:58:10] <jackelzxaa> kelly is a side romance like samara
[6:58:11] <%machshop> "romance"
[6:58:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @Corgifist its about the spirit of it
[6:58:15] <%X2Eliah> yep
[6:58:16] <wolfen091> yes
[6:58:17] <RushUnplugged> Kelly is a freeebie
[6:58:18] <jackelzxaa> liara kelly and samara don't count for me2 technically
[6:58:19] <blackjack8182> Chad Shepard
[6:58:22] <$realm_forge> Is Legion
[6:58:22] <RushUnplugged> Kelly just gives it out
[6:58:23] <%X2Eliah> Kelly is a side fling
[6:58:23] <jackelzxaa> they're just additionals
[6:58:24] <%machshop> kelly just FUCKS
[6:58:26] <jackelzxaa> you can do all of those
[6:58:28] <tattleworm> she dances in your room if you're single at the end i think
[6:58:30] <blackjack8182> Yes
[6:58:30] <peachy996> Romancing Kelly makes her exist in ME3
[6:58:31] <+Punchasaur> pump n dump
[6:58:31] <tattleworm> been a long time
[6:58:37] <%X2Eliah> kinda
[6:58:38] <Broken_Sonex> Kelly is like a Freebbie
[6:58:45] <+D00msDayDan> i am eager to see what pat's penis can do
[6:58:47] <jackelzxaa> if you dump miranda in 3 she dies later
[6:58:49] <%X2Eliah> tbh idk
[6:58:54] <rosemon5001> the ass wasnt just good enough
[6:58:54] <jackelzxaa> if you dump miranda in 2 it's fine
[6:58:54] <RushUnplugged> Miranda gets NO respect, no respect at all
[6:58:56] <SpaceGuntank> if you dump miranda in 3 she walks away crying a waterfall
[6:59:02] <peachy996> It's so weird to get Kelly to show up in Mass Effect 3
[6:59:05] <tranquilturnip> Maybe Kelly just represents the open relationship option
[6:59:07] <rudybrossard> Wow you still online!
[6:59:08] <$realm_forge> ALL of them show up preggers
[6:59:10] <rudybrossard> LOL
[6:59:11] <%machshop> lmao
[6:59:12] <BurdRightsActivist> @jackelzxaa good.
[6:59:16] <%shadowsofpain> remember to romance Kelly for cool shit
[6:59:16] <aiutare47> She gets a permanent death flag if you dump Miranda
[6:59:19] <blackjack8182> If you dump miranda is 3 she dies
[6:59:19] <+RaveBV> lmao
[6:59:27] <+nepetuna> this is the worst its ever been
[6:59:28] <Broken_Sonex> It's a REALLY big ass
[6:59:37] <%machshop> they're just lined up outside the captain's cabin
[6:59:38] <+trizetacannon44> Talking about the Paramour achievement in ME2, you can only get it with a straight relationship.
[6:59:39] <jackelzxaa> everyone's lined up to shepard's elevator to the cabin
[6:59:46] <rudybrossard> Can you have a threesome in 2 ?
[6:59:48] <%AncelDeLambert> JERRY JERRY JERRY JERRY!
[6:59:50] <%Xelhesia> WREX
[6:59:51] <+RaveBV> She only exists to get boned. Once the player shows the interest in her, the game decides to remove her only reason for existing. lmao
[6:59:51] <jackelzxaa> i love mass effect
[6:59:52] <$Futurecity10> He'd high five you
[6:59:52] <+DinnerCalzone> And then Wrex gets YOU pregnant
[6:59:53] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[6:59:56] <RushUnplugged> man you're gonna LOVE the Citadel DLC
[6:59:56] <%idyota> pat...
[6:59:56] <%MidnightBurst12> and he's pregnant
[6:59:57] <tranquilturnip> LUL
[6:59:59] <+RaveBV> no interesT*
[7:00:00] <$SGrim> And then Shepard gets pregnant, and scene
[7:00:00] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[7:00:03] <NeroInfinite> "How'd I get pregnant?"-Garrus
[7:00:06] <+robosqueeb> Wrex is pregnant too
[7:00:06] <%heartlesshealer> and then wrex's belly get big
[7:00:08] <Thepothero> Wrex
[7:00:10] <rudybrossard> Is there even a gay a option in ME2?
[7:00:11] <Broken_Sonex> MAKE ART OF THAT NOW EVERYONE
[7:00:16] <+nepetuna> i think garrus getting pregnant would be on brand
[7:00:18] <critiquequartz> I swear that’s a fan fic
[7:00:21] <wolverinewaswrong> Wrex is jealous you can get people pregnant
[7:00:26] <jackelzxaa> me2 does not have a gay male option unfortunately
[7:00:27] <%StaceMcGate> so how many times did Pat poop tonight?
[7:00:28] <aiutare47> @rudybrossard I think it’s Kaiden only
[7:00:28] <$realm_forge> Wrex nods sagely then leaves
[7:00:36] <KeiPrime> i think you can bone jack as a female but it doesnt go any further than that
[7:00:39] <jackelzxaa> i actually think the kaiden romance for manshep is kind of weak, but the steve romance feels alot more natural and authentic
[7:00:39] <aiutare47> @rudybrossard so no.
[7:00:39] <+RaveBV> You should play Nocturne then
[7:00:46] <peachy996> @rudybrossard nope. In 3 you can romance Kaiden and STEEEEEVE
[7:00:47] <%shadowsofpain> remember to keep as many people alive for the best possible citadel experience
[7:00:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @rudybrossard Jack was supposed to be a gay option but they removed it cuz of Fox News
[7:00:49] <Dead_Trickster> Why have a girl in every port when you can just have them all on the ship.
[7:00:51] <rudybrossard> You can only get Kaidan in Me3
[7:00:51] <%YakumoYomi> One More God Rejected
[7:00:52] <peachy996> STEEEEEEVE
[7:00:52] <NeroInfinite> @StaceMcGate 5 times
[7:00:52] <KeiPrime> nocturne? get those agility buffs and debuffs
[7:00:58] <rudybrossard> What?
[7:00:59] <+D00msDayDan> USE BUFFS
[7:01:00] <jackelzxaa> you can't bone jack as a girl, that's because of fox news controversy.  they cut it because of that
[7:01:00] <%heartlesshealer> Advice: Don't give up on the wake-up boss. Just accept him
[7:01:05] <critiquequartz> Yeah sell it and get strange journey
[7:01:06] <%StaceMcGate> 5 poops? that's a record

[7:04:12] <%YakumoYomi> Did someone say CHAOS?!
[7:04:12] <%X2Eliah> Thane romance is abit creepy, femshep basically takes place of thanes dead wifde
[7:04:12] <triangularblasphemy> The dying increases his power

[7:04:50] <%machshop> the valley of Samara tho
[7:04:52] <%X2Eliah> true
[7:04:52] <+faytthepally> Imagine not staying loyal to Liara through the whole series NotLikeThis
[7:04:54] <%StaceMcGate> how is Samara terrible?
[7:04:56] <RushUnplugged> Morinth best romance, you don't fuck and she kills you
[7:04:56] <KeiPrime> samara has the b00ba tho
[7:04:57] <peachy996> Steve is awful
[7:04:59] <triangularblasphemy> Jedi don't fuck vs Sith fuck to death
[7:05:01] <$realm_forge> He’s religious so he may hit you
[7:05:03] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA I DID MORINTH ITS SO WORTH
[7:05:09] <%machshop> yeh
[7:05:13] <jackelzxaa> miranda gets a little more well rounded after she stops being a nazi
[7:05:14] <Virokwet> jack is cool in 3
[7:05:14] <+DinnerCalzone> @kortin Not until ME3, and they suck
[7:05:15] <+peppament> Samara is ok but morinth is a non option
[7:05:22] <jackelzxaa> ashley got a makeover
[7:05:23] <%idyota> jack's romance is really great in 3
[7:05:26] <peachy996> Character Development for Jack
[7:05:28] <KeiPrime> miranda is pretty WEll Rounded if you ask me
[7:05:29] <CrypticMochi> Does Morinth still become a re-skinned mob?
[7:05:29] <%machshop> nah not even a skeleton, she got vaporized
[7:05:30] <%X2Eliah> steve is good
[7:05:30] <$Futurecity10> Steve is gay
[7:05:31] <KeiPrime> Kappa
[7:05:31] <jackelzxaa> steve is good even if you dont romance him
[7:05:31] <peachy996> I HATE STEVE
[7:05:32] <+D00msDayDan> she's super embarrassed about it too when you meet her
[7:05:33] <+kortin> @DinnerCalzone I see, well that sucks
[7:05:34] <+faytthepally> Ashley is a skeleton, always. Kaiden is a bro
[7:05:36] <tanarath> @stacemcgate I don't consider her the best, but Samara is the most interesting.
[7:05:36] <jackelzxaa> samantha and steve are good characters
[7:05:41] <%heartlesshealer> Steve is a TOKEN
[7:05:44] <%DianaTheAscian> PAAAAAAAAT
[7:05:45] <RushUnplugged> (Morinth's loyalty power is actually awesome but... yeah)
[7:05:47] <Reverend_Godshyne> not enough jack screentime in 3
[7:05:49] <%Xelhesia> Tali and Jack are the only good female options in 3
[7:05:51] <rudybrossard> LOL
[7:05:52] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Samantha is the *best* romance
[7:06:02] <jackelzxaa> samantha is a funny goof and steve is not a token his writing is good
[7:06:04] <peachy996> Steve is the WORST gay romance. I want Garrus not a crying human

[7:06:28] <%heartlesshealer> If he has good writing then I guess they just didn't sell Steve very well
[7:06:39] <jackelzxaa> steve and traynor are still great "friends" characters if you're romancing other people
[7:06:39] <capjordo> Uptime!
[7:06:44] <jackelzxaa> and they get alot of play in the dlc
[7:06:44] <peachy996> Maybe if Steve was a Turian

[7:07:14] <%YakumoYomi> INAFF with the puns
[7:07:14] <%Monkeyweed21> BIOWARE MAGIC
[7:07:17] <rudybrossard> ANd she's a spy
[7:07:22] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[7:07:33] <jackelzxaa> the reason me2 has alot of party member dialog opportunities squandered is that me1 got delayed to polish the dialog, but me2 didnt get that same delay.
[7:07:34] <$realm_forge> Mmmmmm calamari
[7:07:45] <triangularblasphemy> YEAH
[7:07:47] <rudybrossard> Nesle
[7:07:48] <triangularblasphemy> YEEEAAAAAAHHHH
[7:07:48] <%machshop> LUL
[7:07:50] <SpaceGuntank> water is water
[7:07:51] <tanarath> Liara's secretary likes to watch confirmed
[7:07:52] <+DinnerCalzone> damn
[7:07:53] <peachy996> Everybody hates Dasani for good reason
[7:07:53] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[7:07:53] <GandhiTheTerrible> IT'S JUST WATER
[7:07:58] <alextrebeken> water tastes different
[7:07:58] <+faytthepally> <3Aquafina<3
[7:07:59] <%EsotericOdyssey> branded water bad
[7:08:02] <peachy996> The answer is ALWAYS Dasani
[7:08:02] <+QuasartheHero> na man tap water
[7:08:03] <hairtoday> YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
[7:08:08] <%YakumoYomi> I drink tap water. With lemon.
[7:08:08] <%X2Eliah> PAT WE WANT BRANDED WATER
[7:08:08] <+Grayhammatter> it's just water
[7:08:09] <+D00msDayDan> who the goddamn fuck buys bottled water what is fucking wrong with you
[7:08:09] <peachy996> Because Dasani is NOT WATER
[7:08:12] <+goose_attack_almanac> NOT DASANI IS THE ONLY REAL ANSWER
[7:08:13] <aiutare47> If it’s bottled water I’m going fucking thirsty
[7:08:15] <triangularblasphemy> I'M ELATED RIGHT NOW
[7:08:17] <%X2Eliah> BUT ITS A BRAAAAAND
[7:08:17] <%afronooch> Yep
[7:08:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> water tastes different you jerk
[7:08:25] <%heartlesshealer> only machines and labs care about distilled water. Otherwise just tap
[7:08:25] <jackelzxaa> me2 was also going to involve the vehicle more heavily but it got cut and pushed to dlc.  alot of the main missions were written in the concept docs to include the hammerhead as part of it.
[7:08:25] <%X2Eliah> HOW CAN I DRINK IF ITS NOT A BRAAAAND
[7:08:27] <GandhiTheTerrible> ye
[7:08:28] <%machshop> tap is good
[7:08:29] <%SirGO0SE> based
[7:08:29] <%TheYellowcouch> that's a good one
[7:08:30] <%MidnightBurst12> tap water differs between towns tho
[7:08:34] <peachy996> Dasani is poison sold as water
[7:08:35] <$realm_forge> Pat’s favorite water brand is what’s left on his shirt after he washes his hands
[7:08:35] <+faytthepally> Paying taxes LUL
[7:08:35] <+kortin> Whoever makes Fiji water has stolen so much water on fiji, legit
[7:08:37] <jorniev> OUT TAP WATER IS BROWN
[7:08:38] <HaroldDonchee> I can't wait for space water. give me that comet water
[7:08:38] <+Grayhammatter> TAP
[7:08:38] <RushUnplugged> the only reason to buy bottled is if your local water sucks
[7:08:39] <rudybrossard> Or just buy a filter and put the Tap water in it
[7:08:41] <tanarath> Because it's tap water for free to a dollar plus a bottle
[7:08:41] <%Ranryu692> so you always have tap water available outside?
[7:08:42] <alextrebeken> look at this loser, with drinkable tap water
[7:08:44] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I like Dioxide Free water
[7:08:45] <SpaceGuntank> its got the fluoride for yer teeth
[7:08:45] <+D00msDayDan> and the taste? fuckall
[7:08:46] <s3tok41b4> us Americans just have shit tap water lol
[7:08:59] <critiquequartz> Hey yeah nestle got out of being punished for child slavery so maybe don’t support them
[7:08:59] <%machshop> WHAT
[7:09:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> have fun chewing your water
[7:09:11] <%heartlesshealer> cool
[7:09:12] <jackelzxaa> liara's got a killy streak in her
[7:09:13] <peachy996> That's not a romance specific conversation
[7:09:15] <AllenDeadman> she kinda is
[7:09:18] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I live in a rural area im not drinking the tap
[7:09:31] <+Walopoh> 2:12 AM Pat
[7:09:33] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[7:09:39] <jackelzxaa> in lair of the shadow broker theres a video feed of the bartender looking at a picture of liara
[7:09:40] <%heartlesshealer> Oh yeah Nestle got off free for child slaves fuck that
[7:09:41] <%EsotericOdyssey> wrex says "I knew there was a reason I liked you" if he's on the team with liara when she says that
[7:09:43] <+D00msDayDan> i feel like liara being a quarter krogan came up in ME1
[7:09:45] <peachy996> In ME2 you'll see the Shadow Broker looking at a picture of Liara
[7:09:46] <+DinnerCalzone> wait, you don't need to romance liara to have the bartender tell you she;s her father iirc
[7:09:48] <critiquequartz> She’s in ilium to watch liara
[7:09:51] <%Monkeyweed21> pat did you spend all of Illium racially profiling people?
[7:09:57] <$Futurecity10> I never got the convo when I romanced Tali, so _
[7:10:14] <jackelzxaa> volus have it so bad
[7:10:16] <peachy996> Yeah that's not romance specific but it's fine he knows that now
[7:10:20] <RushUnplugged> there's several ok batarians
[7:10:25] <%X2Eliah> batarians are the worst
[7:10:28] <jackelzxaa> aria's batarian sidekick is OKAY
[7:10:34] <jackelzxaa> he does some stuff in me3
[7:10:36] <jackelzxaa> nothing major
[7:10:36] <RushUnplugged> mind you, a LOT are bad but some are cool
[7:10:39] <$SGrim> The Batarian Sentinel had knife armor. He was pretty cool.
[7:10:42] <aiutare47> THATS THE ONE
[7:10:53] <aiutare47> Aria’s second!
[7:10:53] <rudybrossard> ME3's multiplayer sounds like the worst thing ever, but is actually really good
[7:10:59] <jackelzxaa> you never see a batarian female in any game
[7:11:04] <aiutare47> He’s the only good batarian
[7:11:07] <%machshop> and marina sirtis
[7:11:14] <jackelzxaa> you never see a female drell either but you rarely ever see drell in general
[7:11:22] <jackelzxaa> they might be in the comics or something
[7:11:25] <RushUnplugged> ME3's multi was, against all odds, fucking awesome
[7:11:27] <jackelzxaa> but the mass effect comics are really bad
[7:11:28] <%X2Eliah> ME3's MP was the best MP game for years, and i HATE multiplayer games usually
[7:11:42] <%Xelhesia> yup
[7:11:44] <%maenos2> ashley sucks
[7:11:47] <%DianaTheAscian> damn
