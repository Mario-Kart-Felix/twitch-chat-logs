[0:02:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @collindoucet99 toxoplasmosis is a fungi found with cats that make rats and such think cats are not a threat. It is claimed to have no effect on humans but it might be the reason why cats are loved so much by humans
[0:02:00] <starotter70> Fine

[0:03:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> what
[0:03:21] <%shiplord13> Studio Executive: I'm stupid
[0:03:21] <+Ell1ot> no more jittery stream. i had to refresh the page
[0:03:22] <%Strider222> Strider222 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:03:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> what movie?
[0:03:23] <$joylent_blue> its a shitty prequel
[0:03:24] <Tennochief> always blame studio executives
[0:03:27] <+aivalera> What movie?
[0:03:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what movie?
[0:03:30] <@lewdskeletor13> Kids don’t want that, executives are just stupid
[0:03:31] <%JJCheeker> They really don't know what people want
[0:03:31] <%Schrodingers_Box> The Thing?
[0:03:31] <Doodle_Taco> The Thing
[0:03:33] <a_c_chirns> the acting is the same quality

[0:03:45] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[0:03:46] <Zalthia> Kids don’t watch that movie
[0:03:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> People like good special effects
[0:03:54] <collindoucet99> @angriestpat see the Witcher trailer? Looks cool
[0:04:00] <ReaversEdge45> Te Ting
[0:04:05] <$joylent_blue> the fucking kennel scene in the carpenter version is the most horrible thing i've seen in a movie
[0:04:09] <%Emperor_Machinus> kids and executives don't know what they want
[0:04:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Unless you’re a subscriber you’ll get a lot of ads on the Twitch Vod
[0:04:19] <%wolfofsound> bits aren't taxed
[0:04:20] <+Ell1ot> what if you gave Elmo... a hat?
[0:04:22] <Ominnous> Donations are treated as Gifts
[0:04:27] <+SamleyTimes> kennel scene is amazing
[0:04:29] <Ominnous> so they get taxed hard
[0:04:30] <Animal_Farm4> Something about taxes makes bits better pretty sure
[0:04:30] <hntronium> Hat?
[0:04:32] <+Grayhammatter> what if it was purple?
[0:04:35] <Phalanx_Soul> Bits I think you get a higher percentile
[0:04:36] <%MegboyManuel> dont bits go to twitch as a percentage?
[0:04:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> oh shit
[0:04:44] <Jathspuh> Pat, you're really cute tpKyawawa

[0:05:06] <%Wynzler> cheer555 any recommendations on an elgato or other capture device? I was thinking of streaming FE: Three House when it comes out
[0:05:07] <+Noxyba> You would have a hard time convincing your tax collecting entity that any of this is a gift
[0:05:07] <captainnathaniel> what happened to the game?
[0:05:08] <@lewdskeletor13> IT Chapter Two is looking lit
[0:05:09] <$TDotGoat> the cat makes most of the money
[0:05:09] <%shiplord13> I'm pretty much a hobo who dances on the street for money
[0:05:12] <%MegboyManuel> whatddup
[0:05:13] <%Schrodingers_Box> The Thing gave me a fear of dogs for 5 years, Because of the response to an insistant kid wanting to watch a horror movie is to show them one like that and they will not ask again. Pro-Parenting
[0:05:14] <electricelephantsonparade> You with your taxes and healthcare and education and okay roads...commies
[0:05:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SeventyForce Hobos are desiring work

[0:07:04] <ミュウレ4242> also, lovecraft had clinical xenophobia w/ mild visual hallucinations. he wasn't a good writer at all. he just wrote what he saw, which was minorities turning into monsters and plotting against him.

[0:10:29] <ミュウレ4242> this game is a way more faithful adaptation of actual lovecraft stories than basically any game. and they added so much. so many details from this or that story.
[0:10:30] <millamoks> Also a giant titted anime waifu in Fate/Gran Order aftre he loaned his powers out to a character

[0:14:26] <%wolfofsound> @Omegaanimus They hint at it so MUCH for him not to, but then again that's more writing
[0:14:26] <@lewdskeletor13> @starotter70 SILENCE
[0:14:27] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Just looked at the Kill la Kill game. Looks good, might get.

[0:14:59] <mrvidicus> What do you all do when you're abyss-deep in medical debts that you have no control over, reached the point at retail/fast food where you just can't fake it anymore, and no longer relate to anyone you used to be friends with.
[0:15:02] <%wolfofsound> @FoulNightingale drinking too, what did you ask?
[0:15:03] <InugamiTheHound> yeah i want a elgato HD60 for streaming for my xb1.

[0:16:02] <%FoulNightingale> @wolfofsound Just said that his content has made my life more beariable.
[0:16:06] <%FrostMass22> @estuko I get it because his stuff is very dry and usually pretty long. The only advice I have is to maybe read in increments so it doesn't get too boring
[0:16:07] <Tennochief> interesting
[0:16:09] <captainnathaniel> the sinking city is basically our world after the Area 51 raid
[0:16:11] <Us3rr> @estuko yeah the original stuff is super boring because it revolves around Lovecraft's specific phobias for scares
[0:16:15] <+BubbaRands> neat
[0:16:18] <+Ell1ot> lol. i forgot that Skelmo was wearing a hat

[0:17:10] <mrvidicus> Has Elmo ever actually destroyed the stream?
[0:17:11] <DisGuyOvahEre> cat vs dog race war instead of fish vs monkey race war
[0:17:16] <Marpolo13> time to kickstart this race war baby!
[0:17:16] <%abakkus> if the stream goes out again we know it was Elmo's will
[0:17:16] <%FrostMass22> @estuko Oh, that would make it difficult; his writing isn't even modern, so that must make it even harder.
[0:17:17] <Shwepie> Elmo thinks your mixer settings aren't perfect.
[0:17:18] <$joylent_blue> TheWinged7 maybe try refreshing?
[0:17:19] <Tennochief> flip the track, mix the tracks
[0:17:24] <+Estuko> @DisGuyOvahEre there was like, 2 movies on that

[0:41:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what the
[0:41:57] <%wolfofsound> it's the only one too
[0:41:59] <%Chimeraelite> only* newspaper
[0:42:00] <+misterfistor> oh no the lipsync

[0:42:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> her face
[0:42:01] <Doodle_Taco> @mrvidicus If I get drunk maybe
[0:42:04] <+Estuko> Only* newspaper
[0:42:04] <rytisone> that lipsync
[0:42:04] <Djinnazz> that's not a good idea.
[0:42:05] <alex_id> It's the only newspaper.....
[0:42:07] <%shiplord13> There is no town for at least 5 miles
[0:42:09] <starotter70> Rude
[0:42:11] <mrvidicus> Yo, I am seriously getting a "Darkseed 2 Mom's Head Explodes" vibe from this game.
[0:42:11] <%FoulNightingale> Odd that Fallout 4 has better models.
[0:42:13] <jjolion> I'm black, wtf is wrong with her lips?
[0:42:13] <Smart_ZaK1> Hmmm
[0:42:15] <Lurantis_> Her voice doesnt match her model at aaaaall
[0:42:16] <bakkatohri> The models are just fine, but animation is hard.
[0:42:20] <Silly_Duckling> they seem so enthusiastic ResidentSleeper
[0:42:21] <%FoulNightingale> Sweet jacket tho
[0:42:26] <%wolfofsound> @BigjojoBoss popo-itis
[0:42:29] <+RowenCleric> soooo... this game looks way less jenky and awful compared to the other lovecraft games recently
[0:42:31] <%kenpachi9211> look at her dead eyes
[0:42:32] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Watch the newspaper have tones of adverts on Male Vitality supplements
[0:42:34] <$joylent_blue> has Pat ever played Harvester?
[0:42:35] <KishinGrek> He has a silent hill flashlight
[0:42:36] <%Ilpala> jesus what's wrong with her
[0:42:37] <Insanity97> does she blink?
[0:42:41] <%miguelrod777> yeah the faces dont do much the voices are fine
[0:42:41] <+MyDarkStorm> uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Isnt this the Fortune Teller?
[0:42:43] <Djinnazz> Yeah, her voice is way too young for how she looks.
[0:42:44] <+DZiffer> she doesn't need to take notes or anything, huh?
[0:42:44] <Tennochief> needs more sleep
[0:42:47] <jjolion> what engine is this?
[0:42:53] <jjolion> unity?
[0:42:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> jesus christ
[0:42:55] <alexandrecau> I came with clam chowder in my stomach and steel in my balls- bostonian detective
[0:42:56] <starotter70> @joylent_blue I feel like Paige did a stream of it once
[0:42:56] <CrimsonGargoyle> jesus her facial animation is abysmal LUL
[0:43:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @DZiffer She has her own mind palace
[0:43:03] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@snow_bush) (warning)
[0:43:06] <starotter70> @joylent_blue Might be wrong
[0:43:07] <%Ilpala> she's like an actual goddamn muppet
[0:43:10] <mrvidicus> It's all those ZIGARRETESS she smokes.
[0:43:16] <Novillion> I don't think she has a tongue. Thata might be what's weird.
[0:43:21] <Lurantis_> Squid1 Squid2 PunOko Squid4 who needs good models when you can be a fishfucker
[0:43:21] <%snow_bush> What's wrong with your face?
[0:43:23] <$joylent_blue> starotter70 that might be what i'm thinking of? hrm
[0:43:26] <+Punchasaur> her face moves like carrie fischer's
[0:43:26] <Tennochief> 2 questions
[0:43:28] <bakkatohri> This must be an indie studio that can't afford fancy motion capture equipment so they're doing it all by hand.
[0:43:28] <%Dylveryn> Her face is tired
[0:43:30] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Is it just me, or does her necklace look like a noose?
[0:43:30] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I gotta say, this is not the game I thought this was going to be, judging from the trailers
[0:43:34] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Novillion one of the many things that's wrong yes
[0:43:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that's it?
[0:43:37] <Smart_ZaK1> How is that an interview?
[0:43:40] <KishinGrek> Shes freakier than the fish people
[0:43:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> super short interview.
[0:43:44] <starotter70> @joylent_blue I might be getting it confused with Phantasmagoria
[0:43:46] <%AncelDeLambert> you could save these facial animations with better lighting
[0:43:51] <Zalthia> I am pretty sure this is an indie studio
[0:43:51] <Djinnazz> That wasn't an interview, that was mild small talk.
[0:43:52] <+DZiffer> @GarbageQueenEllie She is playing "The Sinking Newspaper" :P
[0:43:54] <jjolion> shoot her
[0:43:54] <Tennochief> wow
[0:43:58] <bakkatohri> Yeah, lighting is definitely important
[0:43:58] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Kigom ?
[0:44:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She gives the Finfuckers nightmares
[0:44:00] <+GeT_IcEd> This game is so good
[0:44:01] <+zcairstrike> @KishinGrek That's because she's only kind of a fish person, you can tell.
[0:44:01] <%Chimeraelite> Hey man you like LORE?
[0:44:01] <CrimsonGargoyle> L O R E
[0:44:02] <mrvidicus> "I'd like to keep this interview going, but the developers are running out of voice budget money for this conversation."
[0:44:03] <alexandrecau> @Smart_ZaK1 How is that a newspaper?
[0:44:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Like, the sun should be in the characters face, and she should have been in relative darkness
[0:44:05] <+trackles_64> Almost as indepth as a polygon interview
[0:44:05] <+BubbaRands> LORE!

[0:44:13] <Dr_Mooose> so much lore!
[0:44:14] <bakkatohri> If you're a 3D artist, you should get some HDR maps off of some site to imrove renders.

[0:44:32] <tastehbread> i hate it
[0:44:34] <ミュウレ4242> lovecraft protags were always spending months or years doing research to sift out tiny grains of truth for some reason.
[0:44:35] <luckyifpurple> This is a lot of news for a paper that only uses two questions per interview
[0:44:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Reall ass investigation stuff

[0:45:46] <+ShikiHisashi> And one of them is Mr Garrison...
[0:45:47] <Solokaldaka> the ghosts of demonetization nakkid1C
[0:45:48] <jjolion> i mean lovecraft was a racist
[0:45:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gay monkeys and spooky ghosts
[0:45:50] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Thrad was kissing a man
[0:45:50] <rytisone> spooky not black ghosts
[0:45:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> If this were a real HP Lovecraft game the Klan would be heroes LUL
[0:45:50] <MasterDecoder> Ghosts that set crosses on fire even!!
[0:45:52] <JackKrauser> 2019 people.
[0:45:52] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat The only way to get rid of ghosts is to shot them with bullets.
[0:45:54] <zenith0111> This is nothing like HP Lovecraft wtfLurk
[0:45:58] <%wolfofsound> uhhhhh yeah ghosts that's the ticket!
[0:45:59] <silverira> I can smell a albhed right now
[0:45:59] <patismyhero> Lol
[0:46:00] <%professormorrigan> the specter of communism
[0:46:01] <+zcairstrike> Do you really expect the KKK to not be all over the literal fish people situation?
[0:46:04] <Novillion> It's a race batle royale in here
[0:46:05] <+Estuko> @BigjojoBoss I'm going to lose my shit if those "Ghosts" are the good guys in this story
[0:46:05] <Tennochief> the situaton is worse than I thought
[0:46:11] <+BubbaRands> I keep forgetting that Lovecraft was a HUGE racist
[0:46:12] <%UncleAWOL> so, ape men, fish men, cthulhu monsters, and the kkk. Yup, sounds like lovecraft
[0:46:18] <haisho> all in on RACE WAR
[0:46:19] <captainnathaniel> @BigjojoBoss a understatement, his KKK friends told him to chill
[0:46:19] <aimlesshealer> @zenith0111 It really isn't...
[0:46:22] <Us3rr> @zenith0111 what are you talking about this is very much like lovecraft

[0:46:37] <haisho> it was flooded Pat
[0:46:38] <alexandrecau> It's silent hill but the rain actually fucks the town
[0:46:38] <+SuperiorDelta> Magic
[0:46:39] <%megabrogus> I really like this game but Im not sure that means I want to play the sherlock shit they made
[0:46:40] <+Rolandknight> because this is just a NIGHTMARE!! MAHAHAHA

[0:46:40] <waifoong98> the game is called sinking city no? Kappa
[0:46:41] <ミュウレ4242> the ape men are rich and ruthles, so the kkk aren't gonna have an eassy time in oakmont.
[0:46:41] <CrimsonGargoyle> the dragon age inquisition went through here
[0:46:41] <+Matto424> I mean the flood was bad enough to ruin the dollar
[0:46:42] <Doodle_Taco> @fool_of_doom yes
[0:46:42] <Goergorion> tentacles moist-ness
[0:46:43] <haisho> super flood
[0:46:43] <+misterfistor> im wet :)
[0:46:43] <%Solidnick18> wet
[0:46:44] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I wonder what the townsfolk think about the Time Cube? Clearly they didn't wait until its defeat to begin mixing with fish
[0:46:44] <KishinGrek> Would you name your cat lik HPL did for 1mil?
[0:46:47] <starotter70> Raw Fish Sex
[0:46:47] <NeroInfinite> yes
[0:46:47] <%wolfofsound> YES
[0:46:48] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat in case you want to StinkyCheese it all the lootable containers refresh after you exit and re-enter the building
[0:46:49] <$drfaustisdead> Yes
[0:46:49] <rytisone> Building is a woman and Pat appeared
[0:46:49] <+DZiffer> And now let's see who is under that ghost mask! Old man Cthulhu?!
[0:46:50] <+AlchemiBeast> evidently
[0:46:50] <Ner234> YES
[0:46:52] <zenith0111> @us3rr Oh trust me it's not
[0:46:52] <+BubbaRands> Race flood
[0:46:54] <Silly_Duckling> Really big
[0:46:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It's the porno industry, Pat!
[0:46:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @silverira Fa ym prat tuh'd dno du gemm baubma
[0:46:55] <+SuperiorDelta> Magic Flood
[0:46:58] <fool_of_doom> @Doodle_Taco ah ok ty
[0:47:01] <Zalthia> I mean, the rain is still going
[0:47:02] <%arkv01> you are already in r'lyeh
[0:47:03] <Zalthia> So
[0:47:05] <mrvidicus> If the flood was caused by Cthulhu rolling in his sleep, likely.
[0:47:06] <%arkv01> you just don't know it yet
[0:47:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> Pat there are propaganda posters essentially saying "Watch out for Cthulu"
[0:47:08] <%realm_forge> It’s all woolie’s bathroom
[0:47:08] <hntronium> As high as it needed to be
[0:47:08] <CopperTucker> I love how just gross this city is
[0:47:09] <Us3rr> floods typically are pat
[0:47:10] <InugamiTheHound> 30-06 is same round used for the M1 Garand
[0:47:11] <+shaderichter_belmont> you gonna track down those ghosts Pat?
[0:47:12] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat it sank the city pat, of course the flood was high
[0:47:12] <laserbeaming> turbo flood
[0:47:15] <Smart_ZaK1> Finger goes in, flood comes out, can't explain that
[0:47:16] <ミュウレ4242> throgmorten did say the flood defied scientific explanation.
[0:47:19] <+DZiffer> Maybe it was the actual Flood, lthe one from Halo.
[0:47:25] <mrvidicus> Remember Godzilla 2014, when Godzilla ascends onto the beach?
[0:47:26] <+zcairstrike> Nah, the buildings all got tipped over on their side during the flood to pour them out.
[0:47:29] <mrvidicus> Imagine that, but Cthulhu.
[0:47:31] <+zcairstrike> After the flood, rather.
[0:47:42] <+trackles_64> Have we seen Cthulu Yet?
[0:47:46] <%arkv01> so c'thulhu big squirt?
[0:47:49] <NeroInfinite> yeah that;s hyst CORAL
[0:47:51] <starotter70> Silent Hill?
[0:47:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @trackles_64 kinda
[0:47:52] <KishinGrek> Would you name your cat like HP Lovecraft did his for 1 million dollars?
[0:47:53] <%UncleAWOL> this whole town is so fucked up
[0:47:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Now we gotta go all JK Rowling and tell the Ape mayor that he's gay
[0:48:08] <$serpenttucker> I am fucking digging this background track, holy shit.
[0:48:16] <captainnathaniel> this whole town should be nuked from the earth
[0:48:19] <Us3rr> we're still on the lovecraft cat joke?
[0:48:20] <Tennochief> ^
[0:48:20] <tastehbread> the swag run
[0:48:23] <transporterthesequel> Oh lord that run tho
[0:48:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Very silent hill
[0:48:27] <Tennochief> nuke the town
[0:48:27] <%arkv01> @KishinGrek yes? It's never leaving the house though
[0:48:29] <mrvidicus> Cthulhu and RYleh wanted some fun in the sun and had a super soaker war outside town.
[0:48:30] <worldbrand> this ummm beyonce
[0:48:32] <+Estuko> @Us3rr no really, just one person repeating it
[0:48:32] <%TheShal> Umbeyonce
[0:48:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> We haven't even invented Nukes yet
[0:48:40] <transporterthesequel> Also yes nuke this town
[0:48:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is the 1920s
[0:48:51] <Tennochief> but kill the fish people first
[0:48:54] <@lewdskeletor13> Ayy I’m back I miss anything cool?
[0:48:55] <MasterDecoder> WHO says AMBIANCE-A?!
[0:48:59] <alexandrecau> For 1 million I think most people will understand, it's like that sign in lethal weapon
[0:49:01] <zenith0111> There's too much dialogue for it to be like Lovecraft
[0:49:02] <%DraxTD> the time of day is end times
[0:49:06] <%wolfofsound> SUN?!
[0:49:06] <haisho> who the fuck would call that a park
[0:49:09] <Doomseas> This seems like the most romantic public park I've ever seen
[0:49:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 we found out spooky ghosts and gay monkeys exist
[0:49:11] <dekkitout> I'm sure nukes in this world are just brief openings to some elder god's domain
[0:49:11] <+DZiffer> Ah, what a nice park.
[0:49:11] <tanarath> Pat, it looks like it's Rain-o-clock.
[0:49:13] <%arkv01> almost as terrifying as seattles hobo parks
[0:49:13] <haisho> looks more like an abandoned lot
[0:49:16] <Tennochief> @lewdskeletor13 gay apes, KKK, mass floods , oh my!
[0:49:18] <mrvidicus> Watch out for needles.
[0:49:28] <Tennochief> KILL HIM

[0:49:32] <Reanimator83> The Scooby gang is going to solve the case of the pointy hooded ghost
[0:49:35] <starotter70> Nah
[0:49:39] <Ner234> Not enough insight
[0:49:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @lewdskeletor13 And we've decided to call the InnMouthers Fishfuckers for posterity
[0:49:45] <rytisone> good thing you got here in summer, winters are real depressing
[0:49:46] <tastehbread> you need to bridge the cultural divide
[0:49:48] <laserbeaming> They worship a fake crab god
[0:49:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Perfect
[0:49:49] <transporterthesequel> I like that this is a game not about the decent into madness
[0:49:50] <KishinGrek> Like bart vs the space mutants
[0:49:52] <Zalthia> Wait the ape guy is gay?
[0:49:58] <Novillion> I appreciate that even the homeless take care to dress in their Sunday best
[0:49:58] <mrvidicus> Like, zoiks, scoob! That ghost just threw a mo-mo-molotov at his house!
[0:49:59] <transporterthesequel> But that at the jump you are already clearly fucked

[0:53:42] <Zalthia> Uncrossed T's are just capital "i"s
[0:53:47] <mrvidicus> Yeah, that nazi- err, police officer's daughter was kidnapped by the cult or something.
[0:53:51] <NeroInfinite> you can just craft money
[0:53:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @captainnathaniel But what if everyone hates me?
[0:54:00] <a_mad_dragon> traps are never useful
[0:54:01] <Zalthia> Or lowercase "l"s
[0:54:06] <haisho> did somebody say traps
[0:54:07] <+Floorislava> they're really good though

[0:56:08] <worldbrand> 50% chance? that's a shitty savescum-encouraging perk
[0:56:09] <Copperage> I could be wrong but I think mind is way stronger than every other tree lol
[0:56:09] <%Teintstein> should we call an ambulance?

[0:56:13] <%cybermooseblue> Thanks @lewdskeletor13
[0:56:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Good idea. That's what I would do
[0:56:15] <%spacehouse> Pat has stroke At
[0:56:16] <DisGuyOvahEre> it would be funny if it made him more insane
[0:56:17] <%ECRead> La Li Lu Le Lo
[0:56:19] <lotharrio> Depending on if there is a max level, the xp ones might be the best.
[0:56:21] <+zcairstrike> Why would you ever not rush the experience perks?
[0:56:23] <tanarath> Do it right now, Pat.
[0:56:23] <mrvidicus> Make sure to grind those order hall resources first!
[0:56:26] <+DZiffer> like anyone would, I don't know why those are skills
[0:56:27] <+Onlysamfisher > I come back to pat having a stroke
[0:56:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ECRead la le lu li am isn't on this stream
[0:56:38] <%cybermooseblue> Hey @angriestpat is streaming in a noisy ass house a waste of my own time? Lol
[0:56:40] <@lewdskeletor13> make big xp number go up
[0:56:43] <Reanimator83> I think the Cats trailer is getting to Pat
[0:56:47] <ミュウレ4242> items are easy to get. xp is harder.
[0:56:47] <haisho> focus one tree
[0:56:48] <+zcairstrike> Both exp, I'd say.
[0:56:49] <+DZiffer> like who wouldn't take "more exp", it makes you level up faster!
[0:56:51] <ZazzyDoesStuff> MAX EXP
[0:56:52] <Rashnam> Max XP, I'd say.
[0:56:58] <Silly_Duckling> Agreed, exp is the way to go
[0:57:03] <%puhff> !uptime
[0:57:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 23m.
[0:57:09] <tastehbread> has he had to shoot a gun yet?
[0:57:15] <zenith0111> HP Lovecraft: Huge Quest
[0:57:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tastehbread yes
[0:57:20] <%Gogogolem> Doesn't gettng more xp fuck you over in late game fallout 4?
[0:57:23] <mrvidicus> The only time you don't take more XP is a sitaution wher eyou get a finite amount of skill-ups, like Fallout New Vegas's perk system.
[0:57:31] <ミュウレ4242> i think mystic tomes unlocks an outfit.
[0:57:40] <mrvidicus> I don't think it applies to FAllout 4 though. Think that game let you level up forever.
[0:57:41] <+blademaster247> Has Pat noticed that little line yet?
[0:57:59] <Sitromxe> Get those [ghosts] pat
[0:58:00] <Silly_Duckling> you level forever in fallout 4, yes
[0:58:00] <%RupanSen> see? ghosts
[0:58:06] <@lewdskeletor13> G-g-host???!
[0:58:09] <zenith0111> Just straight up ghostd
[0:58:14] <Silly_Duckling> well, "forever"
[0:58:28] <%Gogogolem> i am think of new vega
[0:58:37] <Tennochief> shoot gun
[0:58:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Gun sucks. That's sad
[0:58:49] <dekkitout> Sounds about right
[0:58:51] <@lewdskeletor13> Is the combat jank
[0:58:52] <mrvidicus> Let's be real, New Vegas was the real Fallout 4 anyways.
[0:58:55] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat You should upgrade melee be batman.
[0:58:59] <$rdark_ksu> dirt nap
[0:58:59] <zenith0111> I'm surprised there's even a combat system.
[0:59:03] <rytisone> death by jank

[0:59:30] <%Gogogolem> A lovecraft game Jank? i don't believe it.
[0:59:31] <%wolfofsound> @lewdskeletor13 what did I miss?
[0:59:32] <vonmaultke> Probably Jank on purpose to make it a bad option
[0:59:35] <bakkatohri> I kinda like Fallout 3's level design over NV's, but I like NV's writing more.
[0:59:38] <dekkitout> God damn scub coral
[0:59:39] <Tennochief> LUL
[0:59:40] <mrvidicus> Oh wow, look at this fucking painting this game looks like.

[0:59:50] <BunnyEmperor> LUL
[0:59:50] <%cybermooseblue> This game looks like a dystopian bikini bottom

[1:00:46] <Doodle_Taco> BIG BACKDOWM
[1:00:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> use fire tenno
[1:00:48] <+DZiffer> this game reminds me of The Secret World
[1:00:56] <@lewdskeletor13> @waifoong98 beat takeshi had to kill all those people
[1:00:58] <Tennochief> shame the secret world is dead
[1:01:00] <Copperage> yeah it reeks of the secret world
[1:01:22] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat have you used your camera on enemies yet?
[1:01:25] <rytisone> nyah
[1:01:28] <%RupanSen> nyeh
[1:01:29] <laserbeaming> are there evil rats here?
[1:01:30] <Zalthia> The Secret World was really interesting though :(
[1:01:30] <Calek> The Secret World was an amazing MMO
[1:01:37] <Reanimator83> Run past everything
[1:01:40] <TheMorilo> hey, just got here. Is he enjoying it?
[1:01:46] <%UncleAWOL> I'm amazed at how cool the protagonist is dealing with all of this craziness
[1:01:47] <Tennochief> good jank
[1:01:51] <@lewdskeletor13> @themorilo It seems so, yes
[1:01:52] <%wolfofsound> @TheMorilo yeah he seems to
[1:01:53] <+DZiffer> It is, I never said that is a bad thing
[1:01:58] <+zcairstrike> Secret World is *technically* not dead, but it is sure on life support./
[1:02:01] <rytisone> e1m1 instensifies
[1:02:06] <dekkitout> Beg pardon, 'infested'?
[1:02:06] <TheMorilo> This game is some quality jank
[1:02:09] <%wolfofsound> @lewdskeletor13 LUL the safe answer
[1:02:13] <%SuperSonichu> this game reminds me of Vampyr

[1:02:35] <transporterthesequel> Secret World was the shit
[1:02:37] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Hold reload like in fallout?
[1:02:38] <+RenoDeGeneric> I don't think people care as long as you don't aim it
[1:02:40] <Tennochief> @zenith0111 old MMO with 3 factions: Templar, Illuminati and Asian Mystics
[1:02:41] <transporterthesequel> Terrible combat tho
[1:02:44] <zenith0111> Searching for prompts Kappa
[1:02:55] <tanarath> Asian asshole mystics, it was great.
[1:02:55] <+shaderichter_belmont> just menace the pedestrians
[1:03:06] <LodiFrostbeard> i'm allergic to jank, couldn't play this for more than 15 minutes
[1:03:07] <transporterthesequel> Yeah you are already clearly fucked
[1:03:15] <@lewdskeletor13> is there an insanity meter or anything in this game
[1:03:17] <Tennochief> do it anyways
[1:03:19] <mrvidicus> Reminds me of the Church in WW1 in Eternal Darkness.

[1:06:04] <Jack_DT> that doctor probably lifts a lot

[1:07:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> why would you?
[1:07:39] <$ESP_ROOT> muh stomach
[1:07:40] <$drfaustisdead> @Gogogolem He's a reference to a Lovecraft story called Cool Air.
[1:07:40] <ScreamLord> Leech Shits
[1:07:40] <%Zutrax> there is no "bad end"
[1:07:42] <Djinnazz> the fuck you eat leches for woman?!
[1:07:42] <+Fenlig> You wont get to marry Cthulhu at the end
[1:07:45] <ミュウレ4242> i'm am unaware of any actual good end. this is lovecraftian storytelling.
[1:07:45] <+mgskomododragon> EAT the LEECHES
[1:07:46] <%ECRead> you WHAT
[1:07:47] <Doodle_Taco> EAT LEECHES?
[1:07:47] <%arkv01> listen to chat, we are your dad
[1:07:47] <rytisone> no one else played this
[1:07:49] <faegbeard> Pat's going to turn into a vomiting humanoid from this game at this rate
[1:07:53] <lotharrio> Pat asking about bad ending is what causes bad ending to be confirmed.
[1:07:53] <$Dakuu75> LOL
[1:07:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kinky
[1:07:56] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat there are only bad endings.
[1:07:57] <%wolfofsound> WutFace
[1:07:57] <+DZiffer> in that other cthulhu game taking the pills was bad
[1:07:57] <fool_of_doom> nope
[1:07:57] <+PikkoPikko> dude just scratch her
[1:07:59] <%D33TR> pat is scared of random syringes, but random pills is SeemsGood
[1:08:01] <+bubblebasspickles> OwO
[1:08:01] <%Zutrax> @rytisone lies, I've beaten it
[1:08:01] <mrvidicus> Bad endings tend to be better in a Cthulhu game for the player if you just -surrender-
[1:08:02] <BunnyEmperor> Pussy scratching
[1:08:02] <$ESP_ROOT> monkaS
[1:08:02] <Zalthia> I watched the cutscenes on youtube!
[1:08:02] <Djinnazz> they're ONLY bad endings
[1:08:03] <@lewdskeletor13> This is Lovecraft, all the endings are bad
[1:08:05] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat only choice that matter is who you sell out, going nuts for insanity effect is fine
[1:08:05] <dekkitout> Quick, check for track marks
[1:08:07] <Blank9> scratch and sniff
[1:08:09] <$Dakuu75> "scratch me. i'll SUCK YOUR DICK if you scratch me!"
[1:08:09] <ScreamLord> Itchy Tasty
[1:08:10] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Bad is relative. I for one welcome our new Old God overlords
[1:08:12] <Tennochief> as someone with Eczema, constant scratching is NOT fun
[1:08:14] <bakkatohri> Usually if you get the bad endings first it'll motivate you to play through the game and get the good endings
[1:08:17] <zenith0111> This is nothing like Lovecraft
[1:08:17] <tanarath> Go into the Woolie hole, Pat.
[1:08:21] <+shaderichter_belmont> oh you'll drink crazy drugs but won't scratch the weird lady
[1:08:27] <bakkatohri> Because if your'e like me, you stop after getting the good ones.
[1:08:28] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[1:08:28] <%RupanSen> LUL
[1:08:28] <rytisone> @Zutrax no one else
[1:08:28] <%vaporousTippler> The only good endings in Lovecraft don't involve humanity.
[1:08:30] <+shaderichter_belmont> i see
[1:08:31] <%Ninestempest> are we really gonna try and just spoiler pat or what
[1:08:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[1:08:33] <vonmaultke> sounds like Pat's knida game Kappa
[1:08:34] <+Ell1ot> i agree. doesn't lovecraft stories only have bad endings?
[1:08:36] <Sonbunns> in which ending do you T R A N C E N D
[1:08:37] <Copperage> its like real life
[1:08:39] <%Tearonex> SELL OUT KATHULU!
[1:08:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sell them all out, Pat! Sell out EVERYONE
[1:08:42] <Tennochief> sell out the fish fuckers
[1:08:44] <ミュウレ4242> no, there's lots more choices w/ consequences.
[1:09:02] <laughing_squidly> I would guess that like at least HALF of the endings kill the protag
[1:09:04] <InugamiTheHound> huge hole in the floor and everyone can see you take huge shits!
[1:09:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Tearonex we will never sell out elmo!
[1:09:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> shit
[1:09:12] <+TheLakinessMonster> Is there an ending that ends with GUN?
[1:09:18] <badhaye> Become THE MOON PRESENCE Pat. Eyes on the inside.
[1:09:27] <ミュウレ4242> not every town has an Eel street.

[1:09:54] <ZazzyDoesStuff> I think the markers indicate which people is aligned with who.
[1:09:57] <%wolfofsound> octopus ave. LUL
[1:09:58] <Zalthia> Octopus Ave????
[1:09:58] <Copperage> do you have to walk/boat this whole fuckin map
[1:10:01] <Copperage> is there not like a car
[1:10:09] <laughing_squidly> I honestly thought this game would be bad after watching Shy's video
[1:10:16] <badhaye> Beastkin vs Paleblood
[1:10:19] <zenith0111> It is bad
[1:10:20] <ミュウレ4242> polaris rd can't be a good time. always being watched.
[1:10:22] <Tennochief> Shy is a special case when it comes to games
[1:10:24] <@lewdskeletor13> Cars weren’t invented yet Kappa
[1:10:25] <laughing_squidly> oh
[1:10:32] <Doodle_Taco> Hey, Polaris is a Lovecraft story!!
[1:10:34] <%wolfofsound> @lewdskeletor13 LUL
[1:10:37] <Tennochief> Shy has a special ability to break any game she touches
[1:10:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What about a bicycle
[1:10:47] <tdm5wp> Does something in this background music remind anyone else of safe room music from some other game?
[1:10:49] <laughing_squidly> That must be her stand power
[1:10:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Or a trolly
[1:10:50] <$Dakuu75> bull shit. what year does this game take place "no cars" dafuq
[1:10:53] <limeyprick> Boston x Venice?
[1:10:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Bicycles are for fishfuckers
[1:10:58] <Zalthia> 1920s
[1:10:59] <+DZiffer> can't you press the "pin on map" or does that just switch you to the map?
[1:11:02] <Silly_Duckling> big fan of "make your own map"
[1:11:06] <ミュウレ4242> it's during american prohibition.

[1:11:46] <almondcoke> sure seems fine
[1:11:48] <laughing_squidly> I'd love it if more open world games had customizable maps
[1:11:54] <bakkatohri> You know I was about to say that fish aren't weird like birds because some birds have dicks, but then I remembered that whales have dicks
[1:11:56] <$joylent_blue> Get Wet +50
[1:12:11] <dekkitout> Whales are very much not fish

[1:24:05] <mrvidicus> Yeah, this game looks super good. If it wasn't on the Epic Games store, I'd get it.
[1:24:07] <bakkatohri> In games like these, I think it's only artificial diffuculty i.e. all the monsters just have more health. So no point in playing hard mode, right.

[1:28:54] <IronGlorfindel> no more fog could be a good OR bad thing

[1:29:14] <%wolfofsound> Why does it look so clean?!
[1:29:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 Cthulhu is basically a meme even in his stories
[1:29:19] <%Schrodingers_Box> Should just get Woolie on the Couch for it
[1:29:22] <zenith0111> @aimlesshealer Yeah I agree. It's a real shame

[1:36:24] <%Niney_Who> The fucking DEMON TREE
[1:36:25] <einSynd> It's called a church, heathen

[1:36:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just casually walking around
[1:36:33] <Copperage> @Tennochief now you got me thinking that you're playing vincent adultman in this game
[1:36:33] <mrvidicus> The fucking Qlipoth!
[1:36:33] <+zcairstrike> That is the most evil tree I've seen in a while.
[1:36:36] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Oh yes the eldritch pillar that has been there for awhile. We saw it earlier.

[1:36:47] <ActualNobody6400> Do you have a problem with the local Qlipoth
[1:36:47] <Novillion> every second in this town gets more and more blatantly evil
[1:36:48] <ZazzyDoesStuff> DID MATH. Perks stack to 25% but the game is gennerous and rounds up a point.
[1:36:48] <tanarath> The Holy Tree has always been there.
[1:36:49] <%Teintstein> doesn't look like anything to me
[1:36:49] <EuropantLamprey> It's the Great Hollow, go inside to get to Ash Lake
[1:36:52] <spankadelic_> its just a dead space obelisk

[1:46:21] <almondcoke> @ActualNobody6400 good grumps ref
[1:46:23] <aero160h> why does every cthulu game involve a detective?
[1:46:24] <+Punchasaur> gun is life
[1:46:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Now go make some bullets out of that old lady
[1:46:34] <%brickwall35> what if you need it later tho?
[1:46:36] <+razielhex> you can make as much ammo that you want but you can't actively hold that much at any one time @AngriestPat

[1:47:23] <Written_Saber> @aero160h easy way for somebody with no idea what's going on to get involved and stay involved when things get weird
[1:47:24] <ActualNobody6400> Look at all that perfectly good Fanta, all gone to waste
[1:47:26] <Dr_Mooose> wrong neighborhood

[1:48:09] <ActualNobody6400> Is that... Is that David Hayter?
[1:48:09] <mrvidicus> So far, the most terrifying and powerful enemy in this game was the cop.
[1:48:12] <emillionghost> i like the popped collar
[1:48:16] <+razielhex> @TheLakinessMonster LoveCraft runs on racism, not belief in gun

[1:56:03] <%yoshkosh20> i keep forgetting bloodborne is eldrich themed for some reason
[1:56:07] <emillionghost> i thought that said salvation horror lol
[1:56:08] <+misterfistor> ulioth v_v
[1:56:09] <ActualNobody6400> I don't actually know that, I should have clarified
[1:56:10] <dukenux> tbf this is like early XX c
[1:56:12] <Habblewater> The monster killed my family family family and now i've gotta shoot myself up with crack so I don't freak my bean
[1:56:16] <silverira> efluvial grime
[1:56:23] <ZazzyDoesStuff> TAKE PSI. It's looking like a gray health thing from how much more vivid the visions are.
[1:56:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @FrostMass22 But working dads take sick days like Pat uses items in rpgs
[1:56:28] <dukenux> that looks like a big map
[1:56:29] <InugamiTheHound> insanity shotgun!
[1:56:37] <almondcoke> yeah now that i think about it bloodborne was super eldritch oops how did i forget
[1:56:48] <%Typhaeon> Cyclops II is just Stereopes
[1:56:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @yoshkosh20 its because it introduces it so gradually that by the time you realize you are facing the old ones you are too far in to leave
[1:56:50] <almondcoke> gotta go back to it
[1:56:59] <zenith0111> There doesn't seem to be any exploration besides doing missions.
[1:57:00] <dukenux> All the good lovecraftian games don't reference Lovecraft directly
[1:57:04] <natebud> I love post apocalyptic games where the rest of the world is a-ok, but one location is just fucked.
[1:57:09] <%FrostMass22> @almondcoke Because Bloodborne buries the lead until the very end almost
[1:57:13] <mrvidicus> And if you look to the right, you can see the family from The Mist killing themselves.
[1:57:14] <Tennochief> kill the fish instead
[1:57:17] <+DZiffer> drive up the power line for extra points
[1:57:25] <%FrostMass22> Cthulu wants you to eat the Prized Catch
[1:57:26] <fool_of_doom> it's best to avoid seafood
[1:57:28] <Habblewater> I mean you can go into them whenever but all there's just monsters and scavenging shit
[1:57:28] <dekkitout> Eat it, I'll give ya $7
[1:57:29] <fool_of_doom> just to be safe
[1:57:29] <%wolfofsound> eat fish pussy Kreygasm

[1:57:36] <CorazonFeathers> cmonBruh
[1:57:40] <InugamiTheHound> Hey guys remember when Denis Dyack made games like eternal darkness and too human??

[1:57:49] <12gagerager> probably means enemies everywhere
[1:57:52] <Novillion> it means combat

[1:58:05] <+TheSaintJohn> only 1 way to find out
[1:58:05] <CorazonFeathers> Area Kappa
[1:58:07] <Habblewater> the whole area
[1:58:07] <%wolfofsound> @GarbageQueenEllie Bring on that little mermaid Kreygasm
[1:58:08] <mrvidicus> Run Forest, runnnnnnnnnn!
[1:58:09] <ActualNobody6400> it means to cry
[1:58:12] <+DZiffer> It's a tiny Silent Hill
[1:58:12] <almondcoke> true a games gotta get so deep and creepy and weird that you have to make the eldrich connections yourself later on, like it cant be too obvious

[1:58:53] <natebud> That dude had a barnacle on his face
[1:58:55] <CorazonFeathers> Gotta go solve the murder of Saki Konishi

[1:59:23] <+Estuko> They'll try to suck your dick! run away
[1:59:24] <dukenux> thos spidery ones are the worst
[1:59:24] <natebud> they're just taunting you now

[1:59:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just a friendly wylebeast :)
[1:59:33] <dukenux> they're actually WORSE than regular spiders
[1:59:34] <zenith0111> Characters run animation looks so bad
[1:59:34] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pat should go check to see if he's unlocked new outfits

[1:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:52] <%Valdorick> Man, I have to say, I wasn't too sure, about the Eldritch line of clothing from Big and Tall, but they really have a client base, huh?
[1:59:53] <+TheLakinessMonster> They aren't attacking you. Leave the small hand bois be.
[1:59:55] <+timblenaut> maybe use a mouse controller-baby
[1:59:56] <+misterfistor> its releasing its PSYCHO SMOKE
[1:59:58] <flyingavocadosofdoom> Get a toilet paper roll!
[1:59:59] <Copperage> controller aiming LUL
[2:00:02] <Habblewater> whap it
[2:00:05] <lotharrio> You need some light lock-on, I think.
[2:00:05] <Reanimator83> They’re going to impregnate your dick Pat
[2:00:08] <+zcairstrike> @PlainSimpleTailor It doesn't help that Pat has controller aiming right now.
[2:00:08] <%PinkSuprende> Why are you trying to shoot this lovely hide and seek child
[2:00:11] <+MrMcCrabby> this thing is killing your fps
[2:00:12] <tdm5wp> Is game seems better than the mediocre reviews it got
[2:00:14] <dukenux> Use a flamethrower
[2:00:15] <%TheWinged7> hes the giant rat
[2:00:19] <Habblewater> there is light lock on though
[2:00:19] <+linSP> so much fart gas
[2:00:21] <ActualNobody6400> it just wants to make a tenatcle friend with your face

[2:06:57] <Copperage> thats so badass
[2:07:01] <mrvidicus> He looks like Hello Neighbor to me.
[2:07:02] <InugamiTheHound> why does this guy look like a synth from fallout 4
[2:07:02] <Marpolo13> cool
[2:07:02] <CorazonFeathers> Throgmorton sounds like someone who TRIED to create a fake name and he created too much that even if it was real, no one would believe it
[2:07:11] <+Dives__> Stygian: relating to the Styx River
[2:07:15] <+Punchasaur> at least they're not reapers
[2:07:24] <natebud> Yeah we call them twisted.
[2:07:26] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh hey ya big dingus you're still streaming.

[2:07:37] <hntronium> stygian enforcers when
[2:07:40] <almondcoke> how can a man look so normal and so fake
[2:07:42] <+Squidy64> This game looks like the council.
[2:07:44] <$RubberFistFight> Was gonna tune in earlier but my girlfriend and I's oven shit itself so we had to go buy a new one.
[2:07:46] <+HellHunter120> Hmmm~
[2:07:48] <$RubberFistFight> Fun stuff.
[2:07:49] <Marpolo13> lirikPUKE
[2:07:50] <+Punchasaur> homo demons
[2:07:52] <zamzoph> very interesting CoolStoryBob
[2:07:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I KNOW that voice...
[2:07:56] <Zalthia> This professor is weird
[2:07:56] <almondcoke> rip your oven
[2:08:00] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Who is that???
[2:08:08] <alexandrecau> Town survived everything
[2:08:12] <mrvidicus> No don't zoom in!
[2:08:19] <+HellHunter120> This guy needs a little sun
[2:08:21] <Marpolo13> BIG evil
[2:08:29] <zenith0111> I don't understand what is happening
[2:08:30] <$RubberFistFight> @almondcoke eh it was an old Kleenmaid piece of shit, had to have been at least 15 years old, probably more.
[2:08:31] <alexandrecau> comparable eh?
[2:08:31] <CorazonFeathers> Small baby creatures
[2:08:35] <ActualNobody6400> why it gotta be women
[2:08:39] <zenith0111> Are we just Monster Hunter?
[2:08:40] <ActualNobody6400> what'd they do to you
[2:08:41] <+linSP> ah right, he graduated from the college of Byrgenwerth
[2:08:44] <BunnyEmperor> Rapist Fish monkaS
[2:08:50] <alexandrecau> oh just wymen at leas tthe burgers are good
[2:08:51] <Tennochief> could the scientists not come up with any better names
[2:08:52] <+TheSaintJohn> there's something about the way the docs arm fold in that makes me feel real bad
[2:08:52] <mrvidicus> This doctor is so fucking jacked.
[2:08:55] <bakkatohri> If you don't watch yourself, this guy's going to tie you down to some train tracks.
[2:08:56] <JanusII> Pat's face hearing "Jumping Maws".
[2:09:02] <Marpolo13> must be some baller ass food if it's still open
[2:09:04] <haisho> ahaha looter
[2:09:11] <almondcoke> @RubberFistFight probably time for a replacement huh!
[2:09:12] <Smart_ZaK1> The monsters are actually the main attraction
[2:09:13] <+DrDarkhart> Oh god this side quest sucked
[2:09:18] <BunnyEmperor> Bye DansGame
[2:09:21] <gustavozxd> I thought the light in the back was a bug
[2:09:23] <haisho> what a loser
[2:09:23] <natebud> Yeah there's monsters, but they make great wings
[2:09:23] <Marpolo13> MAGIC
[2:09:25] <%Valdorick> If you go looting with a gun... does it become a shlooter?
[2:09:27] <mrvidicus> Inventory go up
[2:09:30] <almondcoke> how did it get in? bye.
[2:09:31] <alexandrecau> @mrvidicus doctors of old had to be strong to restrain patient that won't take the drugs
[2:09:34] <Copperage> thats some quest reward
[2:09:34] <InugamiTheHound> it came out of pat's basement
[2:09:34] <+HellHunter120> Freakin' magic dude
[2:09:35] <tanarath> Hey pat, are you going to get the increased quest rewards skill?
[2:09:36] <%TheWinged7> too full
[2:09:39] <CorazonFeathers> @Marpolo13 It has maids Kappa
[2:09:41] <JumbleJams> too rich
[2:09:46] <$RubberFistFight> @almondcoke indeed. now it's a shiny new westinghouse thingie. Removing the old one and putting the new one is was actually really easy.
[2:09:50] <+linSP> too good, you lose out
[2:09:52] <mrvidicus> @alexandrecau They also had access to all those steroids that nobody knew shrunk the peepee.
[2:10:06] <zenith0111> I bet a speedrun of this game would look hilarious
[2:10:07] <%RupanSen> can you make blood bullets?
[2:10:08] <Marpolo13> @CorazonFeathers sometimes you just gotta risk a Cthulhu monster getting ya for those maids.
[2:10:13] <+unknowingchuck> expand inventory
[2:10:14] <haisho> FUMING
[2:10:23] <ameraaaaaa> to rich for your britchs
[2:10:29] <almondcoke> @RubberFistFight never had to replace an oven myself. here's to all the casseroles and pasta bakes it will see
[2:10:33] <+DZiffer> If you want double rewards, you should probably invest in more bag space
[2:10:34] <%TheWinged7> F
[2:10:34] <natebud> Is this one of those games where XP can be traded in for more pockets
[2:10:36] <haisho> with just a touch of a button, ruin your gameplay experience!
[2:10:39] <%Valdorick> H-how much.
[2:10:44] <+brolosa> uptime!
[2:10:46] <tanarath> You still have the exp, so it's not all gone.
[2:10:52] <ameraaaaaa> oh i gotta go
[2:10:56] <ameraaaaaa> bye
[2:11:02] <Ion_Laser> !uptime
[2:11:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 11m.
[2:11:07] <@lewdskeletor13> @ameraaaaaa Thanks for stopping by!
[2:11:10] <$RubberFistFight> @almondcoke I told the missus that since she really wanted the version with the separate grill, even though we didn't use the grill much, she now has to find things to cook in it
[2:11:11] <+linSP> carry one more bullet
[2:11:12] <+DrDarkhart> Melee damage is only useful for fighting those tiny ones
[2:11:15] <%Falketh2> more dmg
[2:11:15] <zenith0111> Why is there even a level up tree?
[2:11:15] <CorazonFeathers> @Marpolo13 I mean if I could go out with maids and die from a cthulhu-related event I would
[2:11:17] <natebud> if there's any damage+
[2:11:18] <$RubberFistFight> so grilled fish for the forseeable future :D
[2:11:25] <chronoxgp> need a ritual knife
[2:11:27] <%PinkSuprende> You dont think traps would be mildly useful on the shoggoth in that building
[2:11:27] <ミュウレ4242> if you don't do traps, go balls deep into explosives.
[2:11:28] <+faithless_zealot> For you, Pat, prolly more medical supplies =P
[2:11:32] <+Dives__> All points into damage. Become the glass cannon
[2:11:36] <Marpolo13> @CorazonFeathers atta boy
[2:11:36] <%RupanSen> as long as STR go up everything's fine
[2:11:37] <+DrDarkhart> But you definitely want to get the crafting shit once you find new shit
[2:11:38] <%Valdorick> @zenith0111 Because the kids fuck'n LOVE it
[2:11:41] <+DZiffer> more crafting
[2:11:51] <CorazonFeathers> I also have no idea how to spell cuthulhu without messing up somehow Kappa
[2:11:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Mmmm grilled fish
[2:11:57] <almondcoke> @RubberFistFight at least its an excuse to make grilled cheese i suppose!
[2:12:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> i've been on a fish kick as of late
[2:12:02] <tanarath> I'd suggest better gun, because you need gun to survive.
[2:12:16] <natebud> hold up. Grenades?
[2:12:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> which is odd because i'm in beef and pork country
[2:12:16] <Marpolo13> moar gun
[2:12:19] <aimlesshealer> More DPS
[2:12:21] <tanarath> More damage or more bullets could do it.
[2:12:23] <$RubberFistFight> @almondcoke that's a really good point lol
[2:12:27] <Smart_ZaK1> I suggest ammo capacity
[2:12:31] <+timblenaut> i'd go crafting
[2:12:32] <%RupanSen> unlock Sex Pistols Kreygasm
[2:12:36] <+DrDarkhart> But you should run through an infected area to try and find new Weapons
[2:12:36] <natebud> crit vs no crit?
[2:12:38] <zenith0111> Don't upgrade combat tree at all
[2:12:40] <CorazonFeathers> 10% more bullet per bullet
[2:12:43] <+unknowingchuck> more craft materials
[2:12:49] <tanarath> More bullet could do it. Also, melee does hitstun the weaker ones.
[2:13:05] <Silly_Duckling> save until you have 2, then check the reload speed increase to see if it's worth it, then reload the save if it's bad
[2:13:09] <Silly_Duckling> is what I say
[2:13:14] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so that restaurant I found locally that does the authentic poutine - they pronounced it as "poe-teen". That's... wrong, isn't it? You say it differently at least.
[2:13:16] <almondcoke> health cant be a BAD choice
[2:13:30] <haisho> why is eurojank so good

[2:13:53] <itzzapizza> did I just get here at the streams e d?
[2:13:54] <tanarath> Pat, something to think about. What if more quest rewards includes unique/rare rewards?
[2:13:54] <Marpolo13> because it's JANK
[2:13:55] <natebud> Just like downpour...
[2:13:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Euro jank is uaually in gameplay

[2:14:06] <haisho> ah yes the vaunted reverse mermaid
[2:14:06] <IronGlorfindel> Jank means you're doing something new
[2:14:07] <$ESP_ROOT> its my birthday today FeelsBirthdayMan

[2:14:10] <itzzapizza> just my freaking luck.
[2:14:12] <hntronium> Wrong fish person
[2:14:13] <%Valdorick> Only reverse mermaids, and the non-fish part is oldgod penises

[2:14:16] <Neo_Kaiser> Does Pat know the people who made this game created Creepy Watson?

[2:14:28] <natebud> Eurojank is always the ultimate underdog story.
[2:14:30] <$Dakuu75> I can't think about mermaids WITHOUT thinking about Plagueofgripes, lol
[2:14:30] <+DrDarkhart> @Neo_Kaiser You can find a movie poster about it
[2:14:39] <tanarath> Go get sleep, Pat. Thanks for streaming, let us know when you're gonna play outer wilds again.
[2:14:40] <lotharrio> If it has gills? You'd best kills. If it's a fish? Put its head on a dish. If it's got scales? Make sure its life fails.
