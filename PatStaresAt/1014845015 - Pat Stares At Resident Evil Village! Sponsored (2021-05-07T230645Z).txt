[0:12:04] <%Frost_Quill> Did we ever find out anything about Chris after the intro last stream?  i was kinda out of it near the end.
[0:12:05] <$SGrim> Disco
[0:12:05] <%Mathochism> THAT'S REALLY FUCKING HARD
[0:12:05] <+Vigonept> f
[0:12:06] <+NateyBeak> NOT A FAIR FIGHT
[0:12:07] <%I4gotmyname89> Disco
[0:12:08] <%za7az> Oh that's a tough one
[0:12:08] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> stealin ppls info 2021 style ninjaIQ
[0:12:09] <boogaleeboo> Flip a coin, it's what you are looking for
[0:12:10] <iosephe> Disco
[0:12:13] <$SGrim> Disco easily
[0:12:13] <+paladinstarbuster> 13 sentinels ALL DAY
[0:12:13] <+Vigonept> 9 vs 10 disco
[0:12:14] <cardamomo88> both
[0:12:14] <DianaTheAscian> disco cause disco @PatStaresAt
[0:12:17] <%Mr_Pylon> Gotta go Disco for me
[0:12:20] <%RedMageRebel> oh he growlin
[0:12:20] <%solracc25> where's the raffle link?
[0:12:20] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> I refuse to believe that our dear sweet Shy would complain about something
[0:12:21] <+NateyBeak> too difficult, i just beat both recently too
[0:12:21] <Ahk_90> Redeem code #EasyModeIsNowSelectable
[0:12:22] <%invalid_robin> Disco only cause I like more grounded stories
[0:12:22] <Blank9> disco on a value comparison
[0:12:22] <ExpressNode> Oh hey my phone is not giving notifications again when you are on.
[0:12:25] <LordOfThePoultry> disco is more human
[0:12:26] <CheesesSliced> @mathochism you're hard
[0:12:27] <%saadi90> Why not both
[0:12:28] <Profmcstevie> Disco free, it's relentlessly entertaining
[0:12:28] <%Ranryu692> It's easily Disco. Too much of 13 Sentinels was easy to figure out before the reveals
[0:12:28] <%walternatorz> they both excel at what they do
[0:12:28] <fuji_92> Just flip a fucking coin yeah
[0:12:29] <TheShockVox> Disco because it’s a game
[0:12:29] <OldManDeckardCain> 13 sentinels, EASILY
[0:12:33] <cherrycottontail> disco tho
[0:12:34] <%invalid_robin> Depends on how out there scifi you like it
[0:12:34] <42nfl19> Wait this is the same RE7/DMC5 engine right? I thought they had good PC compatibility?
[0:12:36] <polar_kare> Hey Pat do you like that RE is more action packed? Ive never played myself but it seems that way in the recent games.
[0:12:41] <bonebagMEL> Disco is much more relatable
[0:12:41] <ulcaban> I'm playing Disco right now!
[0:12:42] <DianaTheAscian> I would die for Kim
[0:12:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> Kick the Weebs one more time
[0:12:51] <BlueBiscuitGT> Is it me or just bioterrorists have children in RE? Wesker, Birkin, and now Mia
[0:12:52] <+Mrbaconator> i would also give it to disco but it's REALLY CLOSE
[0:13:00] <%Mathochism> @CheesesSliced I am when we're talking about two of the best stories in video games.
[0:13:01] <+paladinstarbuster> 13 sentinels is Way more of a game
[0:13:02] <Stipli> To add to that which is a better purchase 13 sentinels or Disco?
[0:13:02] <TheShockVox> 13 is interesting but it’s a visual novel. The game bits are the least interesting part to me
[0:13:04] <librettodude> 13 Sentinels Explains Everything intricately, Disco Elysium is a lot more emotionally charged
[0:13:07] <%Raiden_Breaker> I am about 40 hours into disco have not played it in a weak have not touched 13
[0:13:13] <%Kief_Meister> neither cause that genre is meh to me
[0:13:17] <CheesesSliced> Some say Disco is dead
[0:13:22] <Blank9> 13 sentinels could do with being more focused on the characters you like
[0:13:23] <%YakumoYomi> @42nfl19 It is, as far as I'm aware. The game runs pretty well for me, even though my RX580 is pretty old
[0:13:32] <ExpressNode> I only played 13 Sentinels for like a minute, I need to get back on that
[0:13:54] <%za7az> @Stipli Disco has so much replayability, 13 sentinels has none
[0:13:55] <+Mrbaconator> it really is like ethan is fucking dante
[0:13:57] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah
[0:14:01] <Oxybe> so VIII runs decently on a rx580? nice
[0:14:04] <Doc_matty> was it the Biggy Tiddy Vampire women?
[0:14:05] <+Vigonept> M O L D
[0:14:07] <cardamomo88> tell us pat
[0:14:08] <+paladinstarbuster> Ethan is a fucking TANK
[0:14:08] <Blank9> mold is super broken, look how much jack regenerates
[0:14:11] <artoflec> tried getting into disco, see the appeal but would definitely go 13 sentinels
[0:14:11] <%dekkitout> Ethan is densely packed
[0:14:14] <fuji_92> Ethan is a beast, dudes invisible
[0:14:15] <xBonYx> Heya Pat, just wondering, have you checked out the latest ff7 integrade trailer and do you have any thoughts?
[0:14:16] <%trekkie11041> trekkie11041 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! RE village is absolutely great . i really like how is a send up to classic horror monsters.
[0:14:17] <critiquequartz> Yeah?
[0:14:20] <T_Sasquatch> Because they wanted it to be ....
[0:14:20] <fuji_92> *invincible
[0:14:24] <BlueSpartan119> asset reuse for the remake
[0:14:29] <%Thescorpion1255> Cheer500 watched your whole stream last night almost fell asleep but I couldn’t stop watching always love watching you play RE
[0:14:34] <librettodude> So when is Resident Evil: Castle coming out
[0:14:34] <%Kief_Meister> yeah I was just thinking about that
[0:14:41] <%solracc25> las plagas?
[0:14:41] <critiquequartz> Looking for a girl in a bizarreo village
[0:14:44] <$Ziegsy> Hey chat! how you doing?
[0:14:44] <SaltyAzteca> Can Ethan spin kick? :D
[0:14:46] <%HitchhikingThrough> I was just looking, there were 4 prototypes total
[0:14:47] <+abrupt_abe> You start both games with a fight in a villiage against a horde before they eventually run off, during which you're expected to barricade yourselves and stay on the move
[0:14:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> He's gonna say the L word
[0:14:53] <+michingmallecho> The hook man mantis15Mantisheart nakkiLove
[0:14:55] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I can't believe we finally got stuff from the hookman demo
[0:14:57] <A_CD_By_Thomas> The Duke is literally an acquaintance of the Merchant, right?
[0:15:03] <%trekkie11041> hookman was cool
[0:15:03] <Bathtub_Surfer> God Hand
[0:15:05] <squeakyclarinet> What is the Hookman Demo?
[0:15:10] <MonsieurHedge> man i wish i was hookman
[0:15:10] <bottom_feeder88> bottom_feeder88 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:15:13] <Kastani3> Yo
[0:15:15] <+paladinstarbuster> Ethan can straight up knife fight werewolves
[0:15:19] <%Raiden_Breaker> the hook man dolls are so much more agressive
[0:15:20] <%YakumoYomi> @Oxybe Yep. I have the 4GB version, and the only noticeable issues I have are texture pop-in and that the frame rate DIES for a few seconds when one of the Daughters attacks you (all the bugs, I guess)
[0:15:21] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> @squeakyclarinet man who hooks
[0:15:23] <butcherbirb> so what are we, resident of an evil village?
[0:15:25] <%Deano8817> so what's the timeline between haunting ground, DMC, and RE4
[0:15:27] <CheesesSliced> Dude, they reused the jerseys out of the assets, but why did something if it's not broken
[0:15:34] <MonsieurHedge> if i was hookman i would runfor president and win
[0:15:34] <%trekkie11041> @squeakyclarinet basiclly beta re4
[0:15:39] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Wut?
[0:15:41] <+michingmallecho> Gasp
[0:15:51] <%bottom_feeder88> Just finished the vod from the last stream, let it continue.
[0:15:57] <%Raiden_Breaker> honestly this game feels like it was made by fans of 4/5
[0:15:58] <%RedMageRebel> I love they went back to their old stuff for inspiration, its really great
[0:15:59] <no123450n> it's like poetry, it rhymes
[0:16:00] <%thbluewarden> Should they make a story book called: "Ethan Winters' Big Day"?
[0:16:01] <Gorgs7> I realized last night, if Rose has the same power as Ethan, then yeah, you should be able to just slap her baby parts back together, dump some goo on it, and it should be fine
[0:16:02] <squeakyclarinet> @iShouldBeAtWorklol Oh, neat. I don't know much of the old series.
[0:16:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> how much did I miss last night. I clocked out at Midnight
[0:16:03] <Oxybe> @yakumoyomi i can live with that
[0:16:05] <SaltyAzteca> Spiritual..successore?
[0:16:06] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> they finally were able to realize their ideas from the hookman demo
[0:16:19] <squeakyclarinet> Brother...
[0:16:20] <cardamomo88> but the head
[0:16:24] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah Ethan May Cry
[0:16:26] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt you serious, same if in window, damage?
[0:16:27] <devanmuse> But this game already has MagnetoDante
[0:16:27] <Stipli> oh man Dante Winters...
[0:16:28] <+NateyBeak> Honey its time for you 4 pm hand torture  yes dear
[0:16:28] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> @squeakyclarinet sorry for the long explanation
[0:16:29] <Mothraken> he's been getting lara crofted
[0:16:29] <+Mrbaconator> ethan also has a devil trigger Kappa
[0:16:29] <%Frost_Quill> Ethan HAS to still be moldy, or Chris taught him to be a superhuman boulder puncher.  One or the other.
[0:16:30] <+eanscrale> Ethan REDGRAVE
[0:16:30] <critiquequartz> It has the same plot as re 4 go find girl in foreign village
[0:16:34] <+Vigonept> DEVIL MOLD
[0:16:34] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt You mentioned that Ethan Winters is the first of many RE characters who has really good endurance as their super power. Technically Sherry Berkins has this already with being stabbed throught the chest and all.
[0:16:34] <%dekkitout> Ethan, long lost relative of Sparda
[0:16:34] <Tracazoid> His left hand attracts his own Rebellion to get stabbed repeatedly
[0:16:35] <%garbageheaphound> ETHAN JUST KEEPS GOIN
[0:16:36] <%HitchhikingThrough> So have you already beaten the game
[0:16:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> Does that Make Chris Vergil
[0:16:39] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Ethan May Sigh
[0:16:41] <neodeluxe_> Ethan loses an extremity each area of the game for all we know LUL
[0:16:44] <cardamomo88> the lost son of sparda
[0:16:45] <Blank9> but ethan FUCKS
[0:16:45] <PanicSwytch> So they repurposed the Hookman game play
[0:16:45] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> i want there to be a hookman in the game
[0:16:48] <%Blackleafx> stay hooked
[0:16:51] <fuji_92> Ethan is the third lost Sparda son
[0:16:52] <fritz_dacat> wait for ethan to say wooho pizza then will know
[0:16:55] <Mildly_Eccentric> Ethan Must Die
[0:16:57] <$Ziegsy> I hear a snoring baby!
[0:16:58] <+paladinstarbuster> remember when Dante just pulled himself through a sword and then healed
[0:16:59] <+Mrbaconator> FUCK IT do it live!
[0:16:59] <%Raiden_Breaker> light from the storm hurts him wasnt it
[0:17:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Does that make Chris Vergil or Lady?
[0:17:03] <%AllenDeadman> fuck it I guess
[0:17:03] <Basch71> to be fair, Ethan Must Die IS a gameplay mode in 7
[0:17:03] <%solracc25> Ethan has been all cut up from every limb
[0:17:03] <vVAstrAVv> ah ethan is demons all along of course
[0:17:04] <balthazar758> Ethan Sparda
[0:17:04] <Ralfclogs> What about Haunting Ground? Does that also factor in?
[0:17:06] <+TensecondTarvis> yay movie night
[0:17:07] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> yeyeye I love the hookman demo
[0:17:08] <+Vigonept> ethans power is shitty dad jokes though
[0:17:17] <CheesesSliced> RE DMC CROSSOVER? HUH? HUH?!
[0:17:18] <heartlesshealer> Dante slid up a sword's GUARD AND HILT
[0:17:22] <squeakyclarinet> Get the popcorn!
[0:17:22] <TheAdMerlin> Ethan was the IT guy second son of virgil all along

[0:18:09] <T_Sasquatch> the only re i have played is re:0 :) so yea ...
[0:18:10] <cosmicgoatee> that's some coat alright
[0:18:16] <+the_paesh> ethan is FINE dont WORRY about it
[0:18:18] <%AllenDeadman> chonky leon
[0:18:22] <%Taisuru> Hell of a coat
[0:18:23] <squeakyclarinet> Why make new shit when you can just recycle stuff?
[0:18:24] <Blank9> it just looks wide because he's in the center instead of slightly offset like in 4
[0:18:26] <Ner234> W i d e Leon
[0:18:27] <%Deft_Thought> Man, this is wild
[0:18:27] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt this looks like spencer mansion stuff
[0:18:29] <cervidaequus> Very fatal frame-y
[0:18:29] <MonsieurHedge> man leon's coat is so fucking cool
[0:18:31] <%RedMageRebel> @PatStaresAt do you think after the remakes are done they'll use Revelations or a similar spin off series to do stories with the OG cast, and mainline for ethan/new characters? Outside of chris we dont see ANYONE older anymore
[0:18:32] <%pyrojack6> man, WIDE Leon is unsettling
[0:18:33] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man, Ethan being a lost sparda son is great! He starts out wearing a tan yellowish shit. A the brothers have primary colors!
[0:18:38] <%Arweynn> so is re8 just straight up re4*2?
[0:18:39] <FlamingoJazz> what year again I forget
[0:18:39] <+Mrbaconator> and they clearly took leons foot step sound effect and gave it to lady dimitrescu
[0:18:44] <PinoProxie> baby
[0:18:47] <balthazar758> i like that leon held the flashlight
[0:18:48] <%HitchhikingThrough> Wait, these are prerendered?
[0:18:48] <+DBTenno> Leon with the og drip
[0:18:54] <pikapie> LUL
[0:18:55] <%blutzwavedave> 100%
[0:18:55] <+Mrbaconator> cuz jesus that's a CHUNKY foot step
[0:18:56] <+KilogramHours> DOLLS
[0:18:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> Best of Both worlds
[0:18:56] <%RedMageRebel> very familiar
[0:18:59] <%walternatorz> I see no similarities whatsover.
[0:19:01] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> yeah i noticed it super hard
[0:19:02] <%HitchhikingThrough> That...
[0:19:02] <%Pookiedaexzile> Its Missing a Fetus
[0:19:02] <%shootbang_exe> oh yep
[0:19:02] <ergulor> oh yeah
[0:19:04] <+KilogramHours> SAME LAUGH
[0:19:04] <fuji_92> HUH
[0:19:05] <T_Sasquatch> nope :)
[0:19:06] <no123450n> SPOOKI
[0:19:06] <%toolofparanoia> very
[0:19:08] <+KilogramHours> WAIT THATS THE SAME LAUGH
[0:19:08] <+Mrbaconator> IT SOUNDS SIMILAR TOO
[0:19:08] <cosmicgoatee> hehehe oh they absolutely brought it back
[0:19:10] <fritz_dacat> same laugh to
[0:19:10] <%Ranryu692> I missed this part, but I remember hearing you say "this is just like the Hookman demo"
[0:19:11] <SaphronBlackbourne> They also tried that with Remake 2
[0:19:11] <Stipli> the doll part?
[0:19:12] <Dio_TR> Oh yeah
[0:19:13] <squeakyclarinet> Wow that's literally the same.
[0:19:15] <%perpetualurker> perpetualurker subscribed with Prime. 
[0:19:15] <+DBTenno> same OOF sound effects too
[0:19:15] <%Kief_Meister> EVEN THE SOUNDS DUDE
[0:19:17] <@SoFarFetched> oh yeah this is pretty close
[0:19:17] <%solracc25> oh no dolla
[0:19:18] <%billyrayjoebob> Wild they made it this far in development and then reworked it from the ground up
[0:19:18] <no123450n> bro just punt it
[0:19:18] <ShudMirelurk> monkaS
[0:19:18] <%bottom_feeder88> they dont have scissors crammed in their dome but I can see it
[0:19:19] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> REFUND
[0:19:20] <SaphronBlackbourne> Yep very simliar
[0:19:21] <Chatterbox1991> SAME SOUND EFFECT
[0:19:21] <%legendscar01> killing fetuses
[0:19:22] <%Deft_Thought> I kinda dig the vignette switch to blue for the hallucinations
[0:19:27] <islandsunn> even that knife looks familiar
[0:19:28] <%AllenDeadman> huh
[0:19:29] <+KilogramHours> WAIT IS THE FOOTSTEPS THE SAME?
[0:19:33] <%toolofparanoia> i din't know the thing about the hook man and the window though
[0:19:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Is it tho
[0:19:36] <Bathtub_Surfer> Creepy dolls are kinda horror trope though
[0:19:37] <CheesesSliced> Could you imagine a world with  a DMC Dante in the RE universe? My imagination hurts.
[0:19:37] <%legendscar01> where's the hookman?
[0:19:39] <%HitchhikingThrough> Wait are the backgrounds here seriously prerendered?
[0:19:42] <pikapie> thats pretty cool
[0:19:42] <%solracc25> yes kill it with fire
[0:19:43] <%walternatorz> I'm sure you just copied Suzi
[0:19:43] <%HitchhikingThrough> How does that even work
[0:19:43] <+Vigonept> is that the mutant baby sound effect?
[0:19:44] <Vertigheist> yooo the dmc barriers
[0:19:45] <%Eaglestrike117> whats pat talkin about?
[0:19:46] <FirearmsInstructor> STOP, DROP AND ROLL, IDIOT!
[0:19:49] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh ok
[0:19:50] <%Deft_Thought> I didn't know anything about the Hookman demo. This feels more in line with something out of Silent Hill.
[0:19:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> TY
[0:19:51] <%Raiden_Breaker> Doll area is prob the weakest part of 8
[0:19:54] <neodeluxe_> Creepy dolls ✅ Nightmare sequence ✅
[0:19:54] <MonsieurHedge> hookman is my FRIEND and we LOVE HIM
[0:19:55] <%MonsterEnvy> 2 out of fours Lords
[0:19:56] <%AtomCatKitten> SmoochSpider subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I'm ready for some more terrible one-liners and dad humor from Ethan
[0:19:57] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Damn, this feels more like Silent Hill than anything else.
[0:20:03] <Ialvarado6> The walls have the same design too
[0:20:05] <tanarath> !uptime
[0:20:05] <@Moobot> @tanarath I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 20m 24s.
[0:20:08] <neodeluxe_> We are only missing a feetus for Vergil's Sniper rifle
[0:20:11] <PinoProxie> I miss cool leon
[0:20:12] <AngryAsian5> It looks like someone Silent Hilled Resident Evil
[0:20:20] <+KilogramHours> I bet that was very disorienting in practice
[0:20:22] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what year was this shown?
[0:20:22] <legendscar01> Spencer Mansion with Salazar Castle Vibes here
[0:20:22] <SaphronBlackbourne> Kinda wish we got a more horrory RE4
[0:20:23] <squeakyclarinet> Fixed not pre-rendered.
[0:20:28] <%RedMageRebel> I actually think I'd like that, its a good mix of classic and new
[0:20:28] <Stipli> does this environment end up in any other capcom games?
[0:20:29] <Blank9> this does look really cool
[0:20:30] <%Raiden_Breaker> the worst part is that you would aim before every cornor
[0:20:30] <PanicSwytch> This wouldve been awesome
[0:20:31] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> but now they could do it
[0:20:33] <%Frost_Quill> I was 9.
[0:20:33] <%YakumoYomi> Same
[0:20:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Nice
[0:20:34] <+KilogramHours> OLD
[0:20:35] <MonsieurHedge> most things were too much for the gamecube to handle
[0:20:35] <+TensecondTarvis> OOF
[0:20:38] <command3rzoomer> would be interesting to live in the alternate universe where this is re4.
[0:20:39] <Profmcstevie> Hopefully an idea they return to
[0:20:40] <%sniffy77> dont let it set in
[0:20:40] <+KilogramHours> I just graduated college
[0:20:40] <%AllenDeadman> I'm glad they took ideas from it and put them in Village
[0:20:42] <ExpressNode> Damn I was just in middle school around that time
[0:20:42] <fritz_dacat> leon is so no plus about the enviroment atacking him
[0:20:42] <T_Sasquatch> i was 5 :)
[0:20:44] <%bottom_feeder88> yet more Nintendo holding everyone back
[0:20:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> Damn I graduated a Decade after that
[0:20:45] <%Piemono> OLD
[0:20:47] <FlamingoJazz> This looks CLEARLY too much for the Gamecube to handle.
[0:20:48] <%BrambleLightgarden> there's no way this is running on a console from back then
[0:20:48] <BetesBoy> wow youre old
[0:20:48] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> I was 6 :)
[0:20:49] <%blutzwavedave> Pat are you ready for your 20 year HS reunion?
[0:20:49] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I graduated in 06 so you're OLD
[0:20:50] <heartlesshealer> Pat's only 4 years older than me oh no
[0:20:50] <Bathtub_Surfer> This looks better than most 360 games
[0:20:51] <%maenos2> graduated 2003?  weird, you're my age but i graduated 2005.  hm.
[0:20:52] <+Vigonept> i graduated highschool in 2018
[0:20:54] <Hairy_butts> I graduated in 2012 BibleThump BibleThump
[0:20:55] <sandwichpeddler> I was 5-6 LUL
[0:20:56] <pikapie> WutFace
[0:20:57] <bedhouse> hookman for smash
[0:20:58] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Hey Pat there’s an achievement for beating the story in THREE HOURS
[0:20:58] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> I was 63 back then
[0:20:58] <%moink1234> I graduated in 2016
[0:21:01] <Oxybe> i keep forgetting im as old as the  O R B
[0:21:03] <+ArtemisCroc> this is like if clocktower was an RE game @PatStaresAt
[0:21:03] <%legendscar01> PS5 graphics
[0:21:05] <%coreyyotto> the goth bug ladies also have hooks
[0:21:05] <+steven19913> I feel like Leon (with ada obv) would be one of the only re protags to live through a DMC game
[0:21:06] <%RedPanda25> This was very much before its time
[0:21:07] <theghosttcatt> 2015
[0:21:07] <Stipli> the gamecube joystick UI LUL
[0:21:09] <+BIumen> very clocktower
[0:21:09] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt I love how dubious us as an audience is about just putting Rose back together. But if she has the same power as Ethan, but better, you should just be able to press that shit back together, dump some goo on it, and it'll be fine :P
[0:21:10] <%Blackleafx> DEFLECT
[0:21:12] <+Mrbaconator> hook man also has giant tits and a big ass like lady D
[0:21:14] <CheesesSliced> Pat graduated high school?!
[0:21:16] <brunoberserk> BIO GHOST
[0:21:16] <A_CD_By_Thomas> What kinda fuckin' virus strain makes ghosts happen LUL
[0:21:18] <neodeluxe_> Name creativity on point for those folks at capcom
[0:21:19] <%Blackleafx> literal bio ghosts
[0:21:20] <+amiroodude> The 3 daughters had hooks too right?
[0:21:20] <+michingmallecho> That awesome jacket
[0:21:21] <+TheotherKristian> I would prefer if this was the RE 4 Remake
[0:21:30] <%legendscar01> HOLY SHIT
[0:21:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> hmmmm
[0:21:33] <%bread_assassin> Going from fixed camera angles to over the shoulder for aiming seems like it'd be a pretty jarring jump.
[0:21:34] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> wow i didnt even notice that
[0:21:36] <+Alopekis> This actually looks pretty cool.
[0:21:38] <Stipli> oh yooooo
[0:21:41] <%ZeludeRose> hahahaha
[0:21:42] <%CalderGaming> @ArtemisCroc funny you should mention that: Haunting Grounds is one of the games that came out of this development
[0:21:43] <%coreyyotto> that's a mirror tho
[0:21:43] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @TheotherKristian Honestly, that'd be pretty dope.
[0:21:43] <%blutzwavedave> Oh that's neat
[0:21:45] <%dekkitout> This is mush more preferable to last night's hallucination pursuer
[0:21:48] <fritz_dacat> capcom the master of resuse
[0:21:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> Capcom playin the Hits
[0:21:49] <neodeluxe_> The flie ladies
[0:21:49] <%Blackleafx> so is leon just straight up fighting ghosts
[0:21:50] <PanicSwytch> NICE
[0:21:50] <TheQButton> God, the Scythes the daughters use are even similar to the hook.
[0:21:53] <donkymagooterson> hookman>bugwoman
[0:21:56] <%solracc25> very much horror movie
[0:21:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> they also have sickles yeah?
[0:22:00] <+Mrbaconator> caution
[0:22:01] <%Frost_Quill> So is he real or is he a hallucination?
[0:22:02] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> im glad they were able to realize it
[0:22:03] <%ringabal> Yes, Leon, use the smoke grenade on the GHOST
[0:22:05] <%bottom_feeder88> RE8 is RE4 with some RE1 flavor
[0:22:07] <fuji_92> CAUTION
[0:22:07] <LordOfThePoultry> even has the same reload animation as re4
[0:22:07] <cosmicgoatee> im actually impressed how they retranslated things
[0:22:08] <Vertigheist> @dekkitout but this one's not as scary
[0:22:09] <+paladinstarbuster> sicklewoman
[0:22:09] <%ZeludeRose> im very glad these ideas are getting put into a finished product
[0:22:09] <Portal_Operater> also Salazar's right hand man.
[0:22:09] <%Raiden_Breaker> I love that caution sign
[0:22:09] <Stipli> some dev looked at this and went, "why didn't we use this?.....can we use it?" LUL
[0:22:11] <+SundanceShot> thst's cool
[0:22:12] <%emperordread> Take that Hookman
[0:22:12] <MonsieurHedge> hookman is so cool i love hookman
[0:22:13] <%blutzwavedave> I'm glad they brough back the Bioghosts
[0:22:13] <%condemned_15> is it the light from the lightning that affects him?
[0:22:13] <dubstep_paladin> yeah she even uses a hooked blade too
[0:22:14] <%MonsterEnvy> Also some insperation from Angine
[0:22:14] <CrazyMedicine> he used a lot of ammo
[0:22:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh yeah they do have sickles/hooks too
[0:22:18] <%legendscar01> We want a version of this game capcom
[0:22:18] <Bathtub_Surfer> Ice farts
[0:22:19] <%RedMageRebel> its crazy how many of these sound effects made it to the final game
[0:22:19] <Mildly_Eccentric> hes a real hallucination
[0:22:19] <%Raiden_Breaker> its better then read screen
[0:22:20] <thackattack00> Oh yeah the daughters literally have hooks
[0:22:21] <heartlesshealer> At least Capcom finally used these fun ideas
[0:22:21] <%AllenDeadman> that's so cool
[0:22:24] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> so did Bioshock rip off hookman with their splicers
[0:22:25] <%Drunkengen> CAUSTION
[0:22:27] <%solracc25> flashbang
[0:22:28] <T_Sasquatch> maybe my brain is broken but after playing dead space 1 , i cant find re games remotely scary
[0:22:30] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> makes me hope for a Hookman enemy
[0:22:31] <+DBTenno> Capcom making good use of its RE4 resource vault
[0:22:33] <neodeluxe_> Yeah but hookman is not a hot crazy goth gf so he loses points there
[0:22:35] <dubstep_paladin> Ethan gets Alastor
[0:22:37] <%ringabal> Bingo's looking REAL good now!
[0:22:38] <+michingmallecho> Hook man became Hook ladies
[0:22:40] <+Mrbaconator> like what if ethan suspiciously eats pizza
[0:22:43] <%garbageheaphound> WILL ETHAN GET A WEREWOLF TRIGGER
[0:22:43] <Agrathane> Could have used those boss ideas when they build Arkham Asylum
[0:22:44] <%YakumoYomi> They just repurposed the idea. That's pretty rad.
[0:22:44] <Blank9> possibly even onimusha, since that also influences dmc1
[0:22:48] <dubstep_paladin> Dante sold it to Duke to pay for pizza and bills
[0:22:51] <%Deano8817> LUL
[0:22:52] <%Blackleafx> Bayonetta 3?

[0:23:13] <+Buzzkill983> INSIGHT GAINED
[0:23:15] <%RedMageRebel> What is a sickle but a skinny hook
[0:23:15] <Shadooper> the demo finally becomes a game
[0:23:15] <$Ziegsy> THATS SICK-le!
[0:23:16] <%AllenDeadman> they use them as hooks
[0:23:17] <CrazyMedicine> Wait until Ethan gets Mold Trigger
[0:23:18] <%Frost_Quill> Majora's Mask had weird fucked up development and that led to it being a very unique dark Zelda game.
[0:23:18] <+DBTenno> inb4 Capcom sets up its own multiverse
[0:23:20] <%legendscar01> Is Resident
[0:23:20] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt How did you feel how they basically turned the Doll House into a Puzzle House/Escape Room?
[0:23:21] <socratetris> Man... I watch the vods so much more than the streams, that I am forgetting that this is live while I watch it

[0:27:23] <%shootbang_exe> do you guys think he'll only have 8 fingers for the whole game?
[0:27:23] <brunoberserk> almost BARRY level
[0:27:25] <butcherbirb> LUL
[0:27:25] <Oxybe> his one liners are perfect for a not-action hero dad

[0:27:30] <+salthoundx41> leons was atleast cringy and funny
[0:27:31] <%dekkitout> They must've had a Dad subject matter expert touch up his dialouge
[0:27:32] <%ringabal> But it comes around tho!
[0:27:34] <+BedHome> LEONS WERE LAME
[0:27:34] <Blank9> he's trying his hardest to sandbag jack baker's one liners
[0:27:35] <A_CD_By_Thomas> 7 and Village very clearly dive right into the cheese with the dialogue
[0:27:36] <twoto858> Ethan tries, Leon doesn't?
[0:27:37] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Remember when Ethan basically said "No u"
[0:27:37] <%Valdorick> Leon had some scathing remarks for people sometimes.
[0:27:37] <ShiningAxis> "I'm sick of bugs"
[0:27:38] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat is this the harshest a child has had in an RE game
[0:27:38] <Vertigheist> what happened to jotaro happened to him tenfold
[0:27:39] <+BedHome> ETHANS ARENT EVEN ONE LINERS

[0:27:51] <%legendscar01> YOUR RIGHT HAND COMES OFF

[0:27:56] <CheesesSliced> Ethan was our old partner, you know
[0:27:57] <pi_in_the_sci> I think they're going out of their way to make ethan lame so he can have a "taking the glasses off" moment
[0:27:58] <chimeraxmachina> Ethans one liners have dad energy all over which seems appropriate
[0:27:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> uhhh
[0:27:59] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[0:28:00] <%MajorCrasher> omg Ethan only has 8 fingers because this is RE8
[0:28:02] <softbirby> Ethan thinks he's cool, Leon knew he was cool, it was all confidence thing.
[0:28:03] <%Huntercd> Does Claire get one-liners? @PatStaresAt
[0:28:04] <+salthoundx41> wHeRe EVEryonE GoiNG BINGo?
[0:28:04] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt But didn't it take years for Leon to be cool? This is only Ethan's outing as a not soldier/cop person. Ain't he a Journalist or something?

[0:33:48] <$Ziegsy> Babies are slippery
[0:33:49] <%Deft_Thought> Pat really wants Mia to be evil
[0:33:50] <%cephalon_nyt> sidebar: the Chris statue for this game is also huge
[0:33:50] <%legendscar01> destroy the baby
[0:33:50] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt Mia's real name is Mia Wesker

[0:33:54] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah this smells like Mia plotting shit again
[0:33:55] <%RedMageRebel> Chris is really bad at talking
[0:33:55] <%dekkitout> He did shoot her quite a bit
[0:33:55] <cardamomo88> IS A MAGIC BABY
[0:33:56] <%MonsterEnvy> I think The villains attacked
[0:33:57] <%walternatorz> chris had to pull over the car to punch a boulder
[0:33:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> CAr crash
[0:33:57] <%AllenDeadman> They were transporting Ethan and the Baby on the same car I assume

[0:33:59] <kikoeru_san> Chris explain one thing please

[0:34:02] <%Taisuru> The baby promised him a successor
[0:34:03] <boogaleeboo> This is 10000% going to be a thing where nine seconds of conversation could have explained everything
[0:34:03] <+rbakervv> mother miranda attacked the convoy
[0:34:03] <Bigyanno> He is working for Umbrella. Surely umbrella wouldn't be evil right?
[0:34:03] <+MarlooRedd> it isn't an ordinary baby. it's a super ninja zombie baby
[0:34:04] <tanarath> Chris is doing his best to continue the Redfield bloodline.

[0:34:06] <MyNameIsRasus> Shoulda went with Zoe
[0:34:06] <no123450n> baby was an inside job
[0:34:07] <%MisterRockett> Chris probably thinks he can't risk Ethan being in one whatever bullshit Mia is up to.
[0:34:07] <+TheHotStuven> I feel like Mia is still alive, she shrugged off the first bullet
[0:34:07] <dubstep_paladin> Distracted him with his mortal enemy. Boulders
[0:34:08] <command3rzoomer> what confuses me is how chris and carlos have the same voice actors

[0:34:10] <%RedMageRebel> that moves so fast you have multiple hands
[0:34:10] <Gopher_Gold> THE BABY
[0:34:11] <perpetualpotionmachine> Watch this whole game be a dumb side thing that has nothing to do with what Chris was trying to do
[0:34:11] <penitentpendant> Were they stupid enough to transport them in the same van?
[0:34:11] <%shurtal> watch this be about TerraSave

[0:34:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hellboy isn't Fully Accurate
[0:34:42] <cardamomo88> lies
[0:34:42] <deviljhojho_> dunno
[0:34:43] <signofzeta> Duke is a poser confirmed
[0:34:44] <%Deft_Thought> It's just tradition
[0:34:46] <+Gespens> Its a tradition thing
[0:34:46] <+ChaosAethr> FFavor
[0:34:46] <%Puhff> preserves the flavor
[0:34:47] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Flavor
[0:34:47] <Robot_Nixon_> taste of butane
[0:34:47] <%Valdorick> Gotta Wood Smoke your smoke
[0:34:47] <%Piemono> yeah kinda
[0:34:47] <%Deano8817> hipster shit
[0:34:47] <%AllenDeadman> flavor shit I guess
[0:34:48] <%dankgerald> AH FUCK IM LATE
[0:34:48] <dinnydanny777> Because it's oil probably
[0:34:48] <thebalticguy1> not a big thing
[0:34:48] <42nfl19> probably HOITY TOITY purist
[0:34:49] <+Vigonept> CHEMICAL
[0:34:49] <%maenos2> does he look like a man who cares what others think
[0:34:49] <%WhereIsWill> flavor
[0:34:50] <%baka_sugoi> its a tase thing
[0:34:50] <+mgskomododragon> Fuel fucks up the flavor
[0:34:50] <+facto905> butane gives bad taste apparently
[0:34:51] <%3d_pbandj> to be classy
[0:34:52] <%RedMageRebel> you heard it from Hellboy probably
[0:34:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Sounds like a hipster thing
[0:34:52] <rReizs> different chemicals probably
[0:34:52] <frostiecrow> hellboy
[0:34:52] <kikoeru_san> There are specific lighters for cigars, but wood match is the only true way
[0:34:52] <%marsantas> Gas from the lighter effect flavour
[0:34:54] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt What if Mia's maiden name is Wesker?
[0:34:54] <+paladinstarbuster> Pass da bobo duke
[0:34:54] <heartlesshealer> "supposed to"
[0:34:55] <%LilyaFatal> Taste
[0:34:55] <snakeelfdruid> Taste the meat and the heat
[0:34:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hellboy isn't fully Accurate information pat
[0:34:57] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> XxDuke420xX
[0:34:58] <+TheBitingIrish> I don't think he cares as long as he CONSOOM
[0:34:58] <%Jaxnos> he carts about, FarFetched. don't ask me how he was in the castle.
[0:34:59] <%LymanAl> butane lighter works too
[0:34:59] <%SeaReally> hipster shit
[0:35:00] <HeroToxiko> That sounds like a weird rich person thing
[0:35:00] <%dankgerald> I'm so sorry Patron, I didnt mean to be late
[0:35:00] <neodeluxe_> @PatStaresAt Cigar Conossieurs says it messes with the flavor
[0:35:01] <%Mendin> Not with a zippo, at least. A torch-style lighter probably works too
[0:35:02] <%Frost_Quill> Don't forget the house with the guitar key, still treasure there too.
[0:35:02] <CheesesSliced> Correct
[0:35:03] <%ArCielArDor> you were watching Hellboy
[0:35:04] <%condemned_15> you can taste the flavor of the lighter's chems in the cigar
[0:35:07] <devanmuse> the "flying fetus key"
[0:35:09] <%fimbulwinters> Duke likes to live dangerously
[0:35:09] <CheesesSliced> Affects the flavour
[0:35:10] <+D00msDayDan> probably just cigar chompers being asshats
[0:35:11] <%RedPanda25> you can but the butane can ruin the flavor
[0:35:11] <+amiroodude> hellboy movie has a scene about it
[0:35:12] <rReizs> like wood fire vs gas fire
[0:35:12] <%Thescorpion1255> I like toasting with a jet lighter
[0:35:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> You mean Four Winged Fetus Key
[0:35:12] <%Puhff> @Gorgs7 ooooooooo
[0:35:13] <%Valdorick> THAT SURE IS
[0:35:13] <deviljhojho_> oh
[0:35:14] <KeiPrime> oh he did donna already? interestin
[0:35:14] <pikapie> MUPPET

[0:36:53] <A_CD_By_Thomas> GOO WOLF
[0:36:54] <%dankgerald> BIOGOO
[0:36:55] <mike2hands> ETHAN THE SUPER STUNT DUMMIE

[0:37:12] <%RedPanda25> took cutscene damage
[0:37:12] <penitentpendant> So the question: Is it truly invincible or is it miniboss tough with loot drop?
[0:37:20] <deviljhojho_> so is ethan the first RE character with magic powers?
[0:37:20] <mar_krow> Ethan not man but mold-man
[0:37:21] <balthazar758> Ethan is a Mold Xmen
[0:37:24] <HeroToxiko> People think being a werewolf is cool but they forget werewoves just shit while they walk
[0:37:25] <TheBlankAce> Didn't expect another invincible monster wandering around already
[0:37:25] <%dankgerald> get in there, pat
[0:37:26] <%condemned_15> key?
[0:37:27] <CheesesSliced> Ethan is actually a bad guy
[0:37:32] <+SpiritRoads> how far in is pat?
[0:37:33] <deviljhojho_> leon was infected with some shit too but it didnt really seem to help him
[0:37:36] <%dankgerald> shove your muzzle in its muzzle
[0:37:43] <@SoFarFetched> @milhousego yup already out and this is the 2nd stream after an 8 hour stream yesterday. So best to dip if you don't wanna be spoiled.
[0:37:43] <%marsantas> You probably had to to make it back off first
[0:37:44] <%bottom_feeder88> Ethan adheres to walls to sleep
[0:37:46] <deviljhojho_> @SpiritRoads 2 strikes
[0:37:46] <%bottom_feeder88> totally normal
[0:37:47] <%Broand> didn't you pick up a crank at some point or did you use it?
[0:37:48] <HeroToxiko> @SpiritRoads literally before that part
[0:37:53] <%Frost_Quill> I hear chickens.

[0:38:04] <$milhousego> @sofarfetched oof, thanks for the warning!
[0:38:05] <%Valdorick> He's just powering up crazy talk with all this being sure of himself.
[0:38:06] <%AllenDeadman> Ok but how did Ethan survive that?
[0:38:07] <penitentpendant> Sneak between house section, not bad asset reuse
[0:38:09] <sirthomas2step> Houses are a werewolves one true weakness
[0:38:17] <%Jaxnos> i feel a crazy talk coming with the "safe in houses" remark
[0:38:20] <%ejackalope> feels like it always right behind you
[0:38:22] <chhdez> They kinda are
[0:38:23] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[0:38:23] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt I wonder if this is what killed that old man at the beginning
[0:38:24] <deviljhojho_> BIOTERROR
[0:38:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> BioWolf
[0:38:26] <shycommando> time to give that wolf the old knife twist ey pat tomatoKnife tomatoMoist
[0:38:26] <%Deft_Thought> Insert John Cena's "Are you sure about that?" meme here
[0:38:27] <+Vigonept> is ethan a goku
[0:38:27] <%Jaxnos> yeah.
[0:38:34] <%dekkitout> @sirthomas2step Werewolves need to be invited in, ya know psaCrazyhand
[0:38:35] <CheesesSliced> Sounds like Gief
[0:38:37] <HeroToxiko> @AllenDeadman just pour some 7up on it he'll be fine
[0:38:40] <kikoeru_san> oh crazy talk
[0:38:47] <Gopher_Gold> zombo
[0:38:49] <%AllenDeadman> fair enough
[0:38:54] <fuji_92> nah Ethan is a sparda
[0:39:00] <$Ziegsy> should have stabbed it in the ears in the cutscene, make it a little deaf
[0:39:00] <deviljhojho_> Fuck off wolfie
[0:39:03] <%condemned_15> he mad
[0:39:04] <Dragovus> Hey this was that first major attack
[0:39:05] <%AllenDeadman> Ethan is a freak
[0:39:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> Good Bio terror
[0:39:08] <CheesesSliced> Does anyone remember zombocom?
[0:39:10] <%ZeludeRose> oh hey its the house from the beginning of the game
[0:39:10] <%pyrojack6> Piss mad were-BOW
[0:39:12] <sirthomas2step> @dekkitout yeah and they super don't like garlic either
[0:39:12] <%dankgerald> TriHard500 sorry i was late to the stream, truck driving can be a fuck. here's some bits so i may pick your brain, what's an intelligent magical creature you would want to see in an early industrial setting?
[0:39:12] <+TheHotStuven> This is the first house
[0:39:13] <sougoe> Doorways, it's one weakness
[0:39:14] <trianglehat> why he mad tho? :)
[0:39:14] <cardamomo88> wolfer no
[0:39:16] <%Piemen99> You can totally kill it
[0:39:19] <Bigyanno> You're safe inside these houses, right up until you aren't
[0:39:23] <butcherbirb> he could totally fit through that door
[0:39:25] <laserbeaming> @AllenDeadman a Biofreak
[0:39:26] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> why would bio energy give it a coat of hair
[0:39:27] <%dantegus> upstairs window is breakable.
[0:39:32] <%Deft_Thought> Are the weapons all clear linear upgrades or is it like RE4 where there's a bit of wiggle room in how useful some of the shit is
[0:39:32] <deviljhojho_> Ethan is great because he is vanilla but technically he is a fucking freak
[0:39:36] <%bottom_feeder88> is ethan the toughest RE protag officially now?
[0:39:45] <%dankgerald> fly
[0:39:46] <%Valdorick> A storm is approaching, encroaching, white chair in isolation.
[0:39:49] <deviljhojho_> he is als a rare RE protagonist that is not a virgin
[0:39:51] <sirthomas2step> this wolf ain't got nothing on el gigante
[0:39:57] <%dankgerald> You have to t-pose and fly over the river
[0:40:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> Behind you
[0:40:04] <mar_krow> Ethan the vampire mold werewolf man
[0:40:04] <+Saggitori> Ethan is a Vanilla King #whiteboysummer
[0:40:05] <+Vigonept> ethan the chad sparda
[0:40:05] <+SargentToughie> Most RE protags handle problems by being super cool and never getting hit. Ethan just face tanks everything like a huge loser, but grits through it
[0:40:06] <penitentpendant> @bottom_feeder88 He at least qualifies for 'most physically damaged'

[0:40:09] <%kknutson4> kknutson4 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Just wanted to say your Co-op stream with Paige/ Plague was a lot of fun,  just a shame about the server issues.   If you guys do another one, I highly recommend doing Remnant: From the Ashes.  It's a really good game for Co-op.

[0:47:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> Don't you have a journal tracking time passing as well?
[0:47:18] <+Saggitori> @PatStaresAt if you look at your journal it'll tell you the time of day in each entry
[0:47:20] <%neroforte177> does the merchant get a backstory or is he just video game merchant
[0:47:20] <penitentpendant> It was night when you arrived, so night time would be a 'full circle' moment
[0:47:20] <deviljhojho_> RE protagonists get their shit wrapped up fast
[0:47:20] <Vertigheist> 3AM your time more like
[0:47:20] <sirthomas2step> Gosh Resident Evil rips jojo off on the low
[0:47:21] <laserbeaming> dawn is very climatic
[0:47:22] <TioXyco> aroun night time or the morning after Kappa
[0:47:22] <+pectusumbra> more like dawn probably
[0:47:23] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt This game has huge RE4 vibes. Village full of murder psychos, merchant, castle, money and trade items.
[0:47:26] <CheesesSliced> Just be just say flutes?
[0:47:27] <%marsantas> Well they keep talking about a ritual, probably midnight
[0:47:30] <SoldSword> Time passed at the very beginning turning from night to dawn
[0:47:33] <%dankgerald> you'll finish it at dawn just like re4
[0:47:39] <mortificent> is it gonna be like classic RE time passing? like it happens in 6 hours in canon?
[0:47:40] <@SoFarFetched> @bettysharkface not yet,just the whole "oh she's special" with no real explanation

[0:47:56] <+reinbachthe3rd> lol
[0:47:59] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yeah I swept the castle like a lunatic
[0:48:00] <mar_krow> Witching hour
[0:48:05] <+jimmyboomjenkins> People talk about Chris punching a boulder but after this I feel like Ethan about 100 times more impressive
[0:48:07] <+zee_generate> If you get a chance pat, if you get close to the goo Ethan says something.
[0:48:11] <dinnydanny777> Why is her lipstick valuable
[0:48:13] <+machinetoys> does he mean in game or outside?
[0:48:15] <cardamomo88> LUL
[0:48:15] <%CatastropheCorvid> @acexclover Don't die.

[0:48:24] <%Kief_Meister> @acexclover die, I think its one where you gotta die
[0:48:24] <+mcjimbo12> Ethan is absolutely the toughest dude in RE history
[0:48:24] <+Vigonept> fetish shit
[0:48:25] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt When you finish off Mother Miranda, are you gonna unite the Flame or become the Dark Lord?
[0:48:25] <monkeyp0wer> Hello Everyone!
[0:48:26] <sirthomas2step> is save room music any good?
[0:48:28] <+TrickytheClown> Hey Pat, I'm still playing my playthrough, so I cant stay and watch but wish you the best! Hope you upload to youtube!
[0:48:29] <Vertigheist> does he still have 3 fingers on his left hand?
[0:48:29] <+mcjimbo12> He basically survives more than Wesker
[0:48:34] <%Ranryu692> so long as you didn't miss any weapons who cares (for the purposes of stream content)
[0:48:38] <+DBTenno> Inb4 Ethan becomes a Mold Boulder and Chris must boulder-punch him.
[0:48:39] <+archangellus00> how was nier?
[0:48:39] <%condemned_15> RE8: Bork Busters
[0:48:41] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat There should be a key to the burned house for something
[0:48:42] <hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt when i stole the lipstick it caused Lady D to ambush me when i went into the courtyard.
[0:48:43] <@SoFarFetched> @acexclover yeah if its the one near the beginning youre "supposed" to lose it.
[0:48:45] <+BedHome> there was a note about the lipstick, the lipstick and its stick are "custom made" and probably include blood based on the other custom made thing in the castle, the fancy wine
[0:48:54] <$Ziegsy> my doggo gets on the sofa and pulls my hand away with her paw. she demands the fuss
[0:48:56] <$SGrim> Chris Redfield: very strong. Ethan Winters: very tough. SeemsGood
[0:48:58] <acexclover> @Kief_Meister i try to after prompting everything and they still kick my ass
[0:49:00] <schiester420> honestly this town must have looked gorgeous before it all went to shit
[0:49:02] <Bigyanno> Is Ethan confirmed superhuman from mold or are they still pretending it's just the healing juice?
[0:49:04] <+Pendragwn> did you let the big BOOBA lady sit on your head yet
[0:49:11] <+Rosy_Joan> ethan basically has an infinite stamina with regen build while everyone else went for just damage and health.

[0:51:08] <%Frost_Quill> @rudiciuscaesar You didn't miss much, he killed big dog and got grenade launcher.  Opened guitar door and got a bird statue.  That's about it.
[0:51:09] <%dankgerald> hold lt and rt to spread your cheeks

[0:51:16] <TheDwarvenBard> Nah it's Hreasvelgr from the hit DMC spinoff series, Shin Megami Tensei
[0:51:16] <squeakyclarinet> I wonder how the game can stay scary with a grenade launcher in your possesion?
[0:51:26] <@SoFarFetched> @andreeg24 it was pretty short,like maybe a couple minutes.
[0:51:28] <mar_krow> Re versus

[0:51:49] <%Frost_Quill> @squeakyclarinet By making it's ammo a pain to get so you're always low.
[0:51:50] <EternalJedi> squeakyclarinet by giving you stuff that takes more than a few grenades to fight
[0:51:51] <+Pendragwn> @BedHome I'm really hoping for a medieval Resident Evil, because they're hinting that all this bio stuff is naturally occuring in the world
[0:51:52] <ivanmistwalker> thanks @bigdumbeak VoHiYo
[0:51:58] <rudiciuscaesar> @Frost_Quill Thank you! I appreciate it. Just woke up from vaccine napp.

[0:56:24] <mortificent> Jill does get fucked up by Nemesis
[0:56:28] <sirthomas2step> Ethan gets turned into bich pudding
[0:56:28] <cardamomo88> MOLD MAN TO THE WIN
[0:56:28] <%Valdorick> They're not Mold people. Ethan will be a-okay by the end of this.
[0:56:30] <+Delenay> his leg was chopped off
[0:56:32] <Daxalog> Leon got infected
[0:56:35] <$SGrim> Mold just grows back
[0:56:36] <TioXyco> and yet he lives.... huh
[0:56:38] <%JoshManVGH> He had his leg cut off that one time
[0:56:38] <Blank9> they get through without having a real injury
[0:56:39] <+BedHome> DID YOU GET THE CASE IN THE CUPBOARD
[0:56:39] <jtsoppy137> Dragon lady messed him up
[0:56:41] <missingangle> Ethan is immortal man with terrible dad quips. I don't think we were ever ready for him.
[0:56:41] <morningmoondude> 'Tis just a mold wound
[0:56:41] <%ringabal> Is Ethan the SuperBeast?
[0:56:41] <RabbitOTM> I love Ethan
[0:56:42] <%sporeian94> Is it true Jill and Leon have never even met, someone said that a couple days ago and that doesn't seem correct

[0:56:48] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> its him, he's the ultimate bioweapon
[0:56:49] <+BedHome> IS THAT A GETABLE CASE IN THE CUPBOARD
[0:56:53] <rudiciuscaesar> he powered on
[0:56:54] <Bigyanno> Ethan should be super fuckin dead

[0:57:03] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  the original openning to RE7 originally had him peged to get bisected in half and crawl around the guest house with his guts hanging out
[0:57:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Jill got tentacle throat fucked
[0:57:03] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Sherry Berkin had a huge ass piece of metal pierced through her chest if you recall. She got fucked up as well!
[0:57:04] <rudiciuscaesar> those are heresy! Those are not our icons, burn them!
[0:57:05] <%Piemono> @BedHome he got it
[0:57:08] <sandwichpeddler> Ethan has canonically had sex, so he lost his virgin super powers
[0:57:08] <+azure_rivers> Madonna & Child ?
[0:57:08] <%RedPanda25> and then ripped his own hands off the hooks
[0:57:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> Behind you there's a cabinet.

[0:57:23] <santafer> I will repeat myself. Ethan is a 40k Ork. part fungus and can staple body parts back together
[0:57:25] <+ChaosAethr> Saw it
[0:57:28] <rudiciuscaesar> I think the one is supposed to be Lady Benneviento and her real daughter, not the puppet
[0:57:31] <+ChaosAethr> It s in lutte
[0:57:31] <brunoberserk> in one of the lutes ?
[0:57:33] <%MonsterEnvy> Whitebook shelf

[0:57:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> OH.
[0:57:45] <%emperordread> Spinel hype
[0:57:45] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt I think they're legitimately starting to tackle that as a plot point, because they finally admitted people didn't like "canon" version of them being mega badasses like the movies portray them
[0:57:46] <boogaleeboo> Nice
[0:57:46] <TimetodiveLTX> must have been a crazy set
[0:57:46] <%bottom_feeder88> Pat has just finished the puppet lord

[0:59:11] <%Frost_Quill> Oh yeah one of the necklaces is a key now right?
[0:59:13] <rudiciuscaesar> does Ethan have a hidden stamina meter so he can't run or does he always just sound like he's doing mad cardio cuz of the troubles.
[0:59:14] <%Deft_Thought> The weapon swapping looks so damn goofy
[0:59:19] <$Faustgesicht> How far we in?
[0:59:24] <%dankgerald> imagine if Ethan just becomes new Wesker
[0:59:30] <rudiciuscaesar> I mean, I appreciate that he sounds tired as shit.
[0:59:30] <squeakyclarinet> Did we figure out what was in Doll Lady's Grave yet?

[1:00:24] <%Monkeyweed21> yes
[1:00:26] <+KilogramHours> @PatStaresAt Do you like that the 2nd Lord was much shorter than the 1st?
[1:00:26] <%pyrojack6> why not
[1:00:28] <%JoshManVGH> Pat got his wish for the Yakuza series
[1:00:29] <jgencs98> sell bird

[1:00:34] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat You can sell metal bird
[1:00:35] <neodeluxe_> Wait can't upgrade the grenade launcher???
[1:00:41] <+amiroodude> @dankgerald ah that makes sense
[1:00:42] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt don't forget the grenade launcher recipes
[1:00:50] <+trashcansan> pat what if you need it later
[1:00:52] <deviljhojho_> hot damn he is swimming in money
[1:00:52] <%dankgerald> BIG BIRD MONEY
[1:00:54] <+andreeg24> can you move attachments from one gun to another appropriate gun?
[1:00:55] <CheesesSliced> The RE universe is severely packing in Jedis
[1:01:10] <%pyrojack6> wait, he lets you buy back your guns?
[1:01:20] <neodeluxe_> It is
[1:01:22] <reonome> ye
[1:01:22] <Meekest> I guess

[1:01:23] <%dankgerald> stop making sex noises, duke
[1:01:23] <%Monkeyweed21> yep

[1:01:23] <%bottom_feeder88> yeah thats great
[1:01:24] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Bulk bullet buy-in Kappa
[1:01:25] <ivanmistwalker> yes
[1:01:26] <+bairros> did Pat get the thing for the Lady's grave?
[1:01:27] <%MonsterEnvy> yep
[1:01:27] <DianaTheAscian> very cheap
[1:01:27] <brunoberserk> FREE BULLET
[1:01:27] <Bigyanno> yes
[1:01:28] <$Ziegsy> Converted in todays currency, pats walking around with 40k US
[1:01:29] <thackattack00> yee
[1:01:30] <+Mrbaconator> you have 160K yes it is cheap
[1:01:32] <%garbageheaphound> man im iffy on the fact you sold the old guns they might be better in the long run
[1:01:33] <boogaleeboo> Considering how much some enemies drop, it's cheaper than the bullets to kill them if you knife them when they fall down
[1:01:35] <%pyrojack6> BUY BUY BUY
[1:01:36] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> still a waste tho
[1:01:38] <%Monkeyweed21> you get more and more money as the game goes on
[1:01:38] <%Dehlome> they drop more money than it costs to shoot them
[1:01:40] <%PhantomMiG> 5-7 kills I think
[1:01:40] <%The_Protagonist> still doesn't even put a dent in how much you have
[1:01:42] <FirearmsInstructor> That's about accurate for current real life ammo prices...
[1:01:42] <jgencs98> save for endgame
[1:01:44] <@SoFarFetched> @bairros yeah he was able to open the grave last stream that had the dolls.Got a Chalice out of it.
[1:01:45] <TheAdMerlin> I'm also impressed he lets you buy back your weapons, just incase there's regret
[1:01:48] <%Mendin> Buy health juice, save chem fluid for ammo
[1:01:51] <deviljhojho_> the RE universe is weird because some apocalyptic shit happens every weekend but all it takes to stop it is a pair of adults packing guns
[1:01:53] <cosmicdischarge> max out the sniper
[1:01:57] <%sporeian94> reload
[1:02:00] <deviljhojho_> sometimes you dont even need 2
[1:02:01] <$SGrim> 9 to 11? 9/11 KKona
[1:02:01] <%furiousfurioso> I feel like reload speed can be good
[1:02:02] <%Pookiedaexzile> Did he buy the extended clip for the 1911 yet
[1:02:03] <MyNameIsRasus> max out sniper, yolo
[1:02:04] <DianaTheAscian> fire rate would be nice
[1:02:05] <Pylohn> reload
[1:02:05] <+bairros> @SoFarFetched thanks
[1:02:06] <cynopterus> reload speed
[1:02:07] <CheesesSliced> Equip Friend of Chests
[1:02:10] <fuji_92> I'd do reload if anything
[1:02:13] <%Crookedspiral> reload
[1:02:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> Maxing out Reload might be alright.
[1:02:22] <%TimetodiveLTX> MLG ready\
[1:02:23] <+andreeg24> upgrade ammo capacity when out of ammo still refills ammo?
[1:02:24] <%dekkitout> Spend dat bread

[1:02:27] <%pyrojack6> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:02:28] <LordOfThePoultry> upgrade all the weapons!
[1:02:28] <%bottom_feeder88> guess you will get some back when you sell it anyway?
[1:02:29] <Gorgs7> If you get the ammo capacity, you don't even need the reload speed
[1:02:31] <austinj24> Reload speed at least
[1:02:33] <MyNameIsRasus> DIRT CHEAP
[1:02:34] <+Javaa01> You're gonna get a lot of mileage from the sniper, it's absolutely worth upgrading
[1:02:35] <%Taisuru> BUT PAT WHAT IF YOU NEED THAT MONEY LATER

[1:17:10] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt did you ever figure out what the piles of flour were all about?
[1:17:11] <%moink1234> @Pookiedaexzile Yeah I like fish sticks
[1:17:12] <MyNameIsRasus> man this new Souls game is wild
[1:17:12] <solanumrose> how far along in the game is he?
[1:17:34] <@SoFarFetched> Maybe halfway or so? He's defeated 2 lords so far
[1:17:36] <%fimbulwinters> This game is RE4 af :D

[1:18:09] <%MonsterEnvy> @reinbachthe3rd Donna the puppet lady
[1:18:10] <+Punchasaur> Goblins now?
[1:18:10] <%Frost_Quill> @umbraawitch Doll lady.
[1:18:10] <%moink1234> @CheesesSliced Yes I like fish sticks inside my mouth
[1:18:12] <%bottom_feeder88> man the Lycans are so much better than the molded
[1:18:13] <%blutzwavedave> This is leagues better than the molded holy shit
[1:18:13] <LtBoiii> they got the beast claws
[1:18:16] <%dekkitout> @umbraawitch Basically the Devil Stand
[1:18:26] <user_naim> Oh come on this IS just a horror version of RE4
[1:18:27] <BlueBiscuitGT> Big whiff
[1:18:29] <%jorniev> DAMN
[1:18:34] <%jorniev> THAT WAS COOL
[1:18:34] <umbraawitch> @Frost_Quill ohh damn i missed the goopy baby monster didn't i? rip i would've liked to see pat's reaction
[1:18:38] <PlumpPotatoRump> Jesus that shotgun is a statement
[1:18:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I MISSED THE PUPPET BATTLE!?
[1:18:46] <@SoFarFetched> yup puppet battle was last night
[1:18:50] <MonsieurHedge> not bad, pat!
[1:18:51] <Gorgs7> Did you ever figure out or have a theory on what the giant piles of flour were all about? @PatStaresAt
[1:18:54] <@SoFarFetched> he ended up streaming for 8 hours
[1:18:55] <%jorniev> @user_naim you now... i think your right!
[1:18:55] <+mental_mashup> Werewolves got that Sol Badguy dp
[1:18:56] <%Deft_Thought> Is the flour mechanic useful at all?
[1:19:01] <rudiciuscaesar> @TurtlesAndTentacles yeah, Benneviento is done.
[1:19:03] <CheesesSliced> @moink1234 you're a heterosexual fish
[1:19:07] <+KilogramHours> @PatStaresAt Man it would suck to only have 7 fingers
[1:19:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hey Ethan count to 9
[1:19:13] <rudiciuscaesar> also, Caligula!? Is that the fish's name? Is that Del Lago Due?
[1:19:20] <+BedHome> oh my god
[1:19:20] <+KilogramHours> im a fucking idiot :)
[1:19:23] <+rbakervv> @umbraawitch reaction is best summed up as "Nope" and running away, pretty funny
[1:19:24] <+BedHome> resident evil 8 fingers
[1:19:25] <jgencs98> kinda limited, the few times they use flour bags
[1:19:28] <@SoFarFetched> He has 8 fingers cause it's RE8 PogChamp
[1:19:29] <%king_wragles> RE8, eight fingers. Coincidence?
[1:19:29] <%Arweynn> re8 fingers
[1:19:29] <%condemned_15> he's like Frodo of the 9 fingers
[1:19:29] <%coreyyotto> eight huh
[1:19:31] <+LunarDensetsu> im so late
[1:19:31] <IminyourBase> a pinky is hardly a finger
[1:19:32] <%king_wragles> Probaly
[1:19:35] <+zee_generate> Oooooh like re8
[1:19:35] <Vertigheist> for a guy with 8 fingers his aim is good
[1:19:35] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> By Tree
[1:19:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Despair!!!! @rudiciuscaesar @sofarfetched
[1:19:36] <+AllTheZibas> I mean, hes been doing good with only 8
[1:19:37] <rudiciuscaesar> I had 8 for 5 months till my cast was off, it was AWFUL
[1:19:38] <%moink1234> @CheesesSliced Nah I'm a homosexual fish
[1:19:38] <%Dehlome> like left 4 dead
[1:19:39] <fuji_92> 8 like re8 Kappa
[1:19:40] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  8 Fingers for Resident Evil 8?
[1:19:41] <BlueBiscuitGT> I like eight, it's still divisible by 2
[1:19:41] <%dekkitout> It would also suck to lose a hand, but that doesn't seem to be Ethan's problem
[1:19:42] <LtBoiii> 88 fingers ethan
[1:19:43] <cynopterus> eh like 8 1/2
[1:19:43] <pipboy344> CALIGULA? CINEMA SNOB
[1:19:44] <rudiciuscaesar> and it was on my non-dominant hand!
[1:19:44] <umbraawitch> @rbakervv great monster design though, truly horrifying
[1:19:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> By tree apparenlty.
[1:19:49] <%RetroCop87> Ethan can likely just stick someone elses fingers on
[1:19:51] <merrja> most people only have 8 fingers
[1:19:51] <MonsieurHedge> the other two fingers were limiters, ethan is stronger now
[1:19:54] <+andreeg24> does that mean, since he doesn't have 9 or 10 fingers, he can't get another game?
[1:19:55] <tanarath> he lost his wedding ring.
[1:19:56] <$bognugget> im gonna laugh my ass off if you just find his fingers laying somewhere and he reattaches them
[1:19:58] <%The_Gaming_Karp> pot on tree?
[1:19:59] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao there's a pot in that tree
[1:20:00] <+rbakervv> @umbraawitch oh yeah
[1:20:01] <%walternatorz> pat, is there something above the rag  on the corner of that tall structure?
[1:20:05] <%MonsterEnvy> Maybe around the other corner
[1:20:07] <+BedHome> he has toes still
[1:20:09] <+TheHotStuven> back side of the house?
[1:20:09] <cynopterus> can you hit the flour?
[1:20:11] <CheesesSliced> Not having a pinky affects your balance
[1:20:14] <+Delenay> under dock?
[1:20:14] <+MeatBomb> You think Ethan's big climax is saying a half-decent one-liner?
[1:20:16] <+Pendragwn> reload guns quickly you'll see he has way more fingers, and it will become funnier as the game progresses
[1:20:17] <Meekest> It's a herb in the grass
[1:20:17] <+BedHome> he can loose a toe
[1:20:21] <%walternatorz> not tree
[1:20:24] <rudiciuscaesar> farm machine
[1:20:26] <+BedHome> then in the next game he can lose both feet and all his left hand
[1:20:27] <+andreeg24> with toes, he can go to re18
[1:20:29] <MonsieurHedge> this game really loves putting things above you, huh
[1:20:30] <%RetroCop87> lobster trap?
[1:20:35] <+Fenris_Alexius> Just tuned in. Saw the whole first stream, what'd I miss?
[1:20:36] <TheMadBadger> Could be a fish to shoot? or are those labelled differently?
[1:20:37] <Khorneflakes_> But if it was LUL
[1:20:41] <cynopterus> hit the flour with the knife?
[1:20:43] <+BedHome> we can just graft more hands on him
[1:20:46] <CheesesSliced> @moink1234 classique
[1:20:46] <+BedHome> resident evil forever

[1:21:03] <+Punchasaur> Friendly reminder that they’re making a Gollum game for god knows why
[1:21:07] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt did you ever figure out what the giant piles of flour were about?
[1:21:10] <MonsieurHedge> i hope ethan gets cool biomutant powers like Piers did that one time
[1:21:15] <cardamomo88> SabaPing SabaPing
[1:21:16] <MonsieurHedge> like having a mold blast or something

[1:21:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's just fixing the roof.
[1:21:42] <%The_Protagonist> it's supposed to be like "stealth" for a brief moment
[1:21:44] <+KilogramHours> feisty
[1:21:53] <connerhozer> Can’t wait for Ethan to release all the mold in his body and turn it into a Stand
[1:21:58] <MonsieurHedge> the roof is no longer being fixed
[1:22:07] <reddpop_> ah yes the pinnacle of survival horror weapons: the sniper
[1:22:11] <chimeraxmachina> @gorgs7 aren’t there two wheat mills? Or do u mean mechanically? Probably can be ignited since flour can cause explosions
[1:22:19] <+andreeg24> you had an X for the item that the guy on the roof dropped
[1:22:19] <CheesesSliced> Dark Souls boss name: Cod God
[1:22:20] <+Fenris_Alexius> @MonsieurHedge Pretty sure his biomutant powers are his stupid amounts of durability and regen

[1:43:22] <rudiciuscaesar> fish man gets never gonna have sex again form twice over
[1:43:22] <balthazar758> fishdude
[1:43:24] <ShiningAxis> not everyone can be magneto
[1:43:30] <%dekkitout> HEISENBERG GETS IT SO GOOD
[1:43:31] <MyNameIsRasus> WEREWOLF MAGNETO**
[1:43:31] <Gorgs7> Yeah, this guy's just a super weak fish dude
[1:43:33] <+Buzzkill983> Its true
[1:43:33] <%Drunkengen> HE GETS TO PLAY MARVEL
[1:43:34] <Biohazard_Terry> Magneto Helsing yup
[1:43:35] <rudiciuscaesar> Heisen might not have junk, you don't know. Eunuch maybe
[1:43:35] <$PinkertonDanPie> fish incel
[1:43:35] <dbag202> Freaky fish guy
[1:43:36] <cardamomo88> SabaPing SabaPing  has not rigths

[1:43:37] <+necrocannibal2> poor guy
[1:43:38] <neodeluxe_> And this guy get's to be a lovecraftian monster
[1:43:39] <@SoFarFetched> If he's truly Magneto,the only way to defeat him is with a wooden gun geefSmugAF
[1:43:39] <HeroToxiko> higher status, more hoonmahn
[1:43:40] <umbraawitch> got the short end of the stick
[1:43:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Regular" yeah right
[1:43:43] <+MeatBomb> Also, I bet there's no internet in that lake.
[1:43:44] <jorniev> LIKE THIS GUY SHOULD HAVE GONE FIRST
[1:43:45] <boogaleeboo> I don't know, dragons are cool
[1:43:45] <kuristinaakosplay> His design is pretty neat tho!
[1:43:46] <+KilogramHours> fishcel
[1:43:47] <jtsoppy137> Heisenburg becomes Max LUL
[1:43:48] <%RedMageRebel> hes definitely a kid or mentally handicapped
[1:43:48] <%Teyaric> Wasn't Dimi ALREADY here? i thought she was like 500 years old or something?
[1:43:49] <+StraySheep28> its rare that the deep sea is pretty pat
[1:43:50] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Yeah his mutation seems much more unstable
[1:43:50] <+Pendragwn> There is a lore dump about them all and how he's a big loser
[1:43:51] <%Ranryu692> until you actually deal with him and find out what his downside is
[1:43:52] <%KuroStardust> but he gets Yellow Temperance
[1:43:54] <%weissguard> And look like MaximilianDood and Father Gascoigne's love child, that Heisenberg.
[1:43:55] <cardamomo88> maybe his dick si too small
[1:43:56] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Heisenburg is also the most poweful
[1:43:56] <GunEden> eh i say dimitrescu
[1:43:57] <+zoopbooploop> WHY DOES MOLD TURN YOU INTO MAGNETO
[1:43:58] <avery__island> ok ew
[1:44:00] <+Ilpala> heisenberg, lady d close second, donna distant third, moreau in the fucking dirt
[1:44:03] <%RetroCop87> Ethan can regen
[1:44:04] <Tracazoid> Heisenburg also seems to be super strong to wield that hammer like he does
[1:44:04] <+KaijuUltimax> Heisenberg gets the special privilege of just being a Bloodborne boss
[1:44:06] <+burntwing> Wesker ươn thật lotto
[1:44:09] <pikapie> @SoFarFetched can diddy kong beat magneto
[1:44:10] <%dekkitout> Like- can ANYONE possibly fly in Resident Evil without wings?
[1:44:12] <+Vigonept> MAGNETIC MOLD
[1:44:16] <$PinkertonDanPie> Stangl Platr
[1:44:16] <rudiciuscaesar> the bosses all appear to be at least 100 years old, judging by the lore
[1:44:17] <AlphaRayAllen> NO IT'S SCIENCE
[1:44:18] <Ethel9727> Honestly, Dimitrescu thinking that she's Miranda's favorite makes a LOT of sense.
[1:44:18] <+KilogramHours> Nanomachiens Son
[1:44:18] <TheChewDawg> Did someone get the lovecraft fishman end of the stick?
[1:44:18] <Vyneci> Now I'm wondering what a Wesker vs. Heisenberg would look like
[1:44:18] <Ner234> ACTUAL magic
[1:44:19] <%cvp5127> funny how eisenberg is the most human and the most powerful
[1:44:20] <Aydarkzero> big supernatural
[1:44:20] <%jorniev> I AGREE
[1:44:20] <$PinkertonDanPie> Platr
[1:44:22] <Shardlab> That is mutation
[1:44:22] <Tracazoid> Alexia had biomagic too
[1:44:23] <%AllenDeadman> good
[1:44:24] <%3d_pbandj> Someone's gotta be Aquaman
[1:44:24] <+kewlmyc> Implying they ever cared
[1:44:24] <+JonathLP> To be fair, they gave up in RE6
[1:44:24] <cynopterus> maybe his hammer is just magneto
[1:44:25] <reddpop_> nanomachines
[1:44:25] <boogaleeboo> It's bioelectric electromagnetism!
[1:44:26] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah I put Lady D at a close second yeah.
[1:44:26] <%chrisarithmetic> he must be the favorite
[1:44:26] <avery__island> too much iron in his blood
[1:44:26] <+Delenay> he might be a monster still
[1:44:27] <%bread_assassin> I dunno how the Heisenburg fight is gonna go since there should be no way for him to lose.
[1:44:28] <+Pendragwn> @Tracazoid he's using magneto powers
[1:44:28] <+KilogramHours> Its Nanomachines
[1:44:28] <vonmaultke> embrace the magic
[1:44:29] <%Drunkengen> How can he get Gravity Squeeze
[1:44:29] <+MeatBomb> Emotional support empty pistol?
[1:44:30] <balthazar758> electromagnetic bio powers
[1:44:30] <Gorgs7> surprisingly weird normal table in the middle of a ruined city scape
[1:44:30] <rudiciuscaesar> like, Lady D had her daughters as late as 1958

[1:44:41] <fritz_dacat> Ethan God stop it
[1:44:42] <%marsantas> His hammer does seem technological, it might just be tech magic
[1:44:42] <MyNameIsRasus> no you don't understand he biomanipulates the iron in his body to create strong magnetic currents
[1:44:42] <rudiciuscaesar> sutado pawa

[1:44:57] <Tracazoid> Good point Pendagwn, didn't think he's using his magneto powers to wield the hammer
[1:44:58] <CheesesSliced> That was a big one!
[1:45:01] <+Vigonept> its how proud he sounds thats the worst
[1:45:01] <ShiningAxis> waterwheel

[1:45:10] <+mgskomododragon> do you run faster while holding the knide Kappa
[1:45:10] <Ethel9727> Heisenberg also might have magneto powers but also might just be like...normal durability and lifespan.

[1:45:32] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt this is the reason I'm never the first one to try any procedure, wait for like 10 years, see all the weird bio-terror side-effects first
[1:45:33] <@SoFarFetched> do you tell that to Zangief "Big baby jumping!"
[1:45:34] <+Pendragwn> @Tracazoid the fights with him sure make that level of magneto powers seem like child's play lol

[1:50:47] <HeroToxiko> Free him from his gooey flesh prison
[1:50:49] <%Agami23> hey pat, did you know if you spam the block button you can make ethan sound like a banjo kazooie character?

[1:50:56] <%Frost_Quill> deal
[1:50:57] <$Ziegsy> now watch you find a kids corpse cus he was little
[1:50:58] <%EbolaBeetle> Was the puzzle sideways
[1:51:03] <%walternatorz> if you can't get 2000 lbs of fish....
[1:51:03] <CheesesSliced> Some fish have lungs
[1:51:05] <+necrocannibal2> I'm sure he's not going to come back as traditional boss fight very soon
[1:51:05] <luciluxlu0> Ethan didn't hear no bell
[1:51:05] <%EbolaBeetle> that was the trick?
[1:51:05] <ExpressNode> I guess hes a mutant lung fish
[1:51:06] <chimeraxmachina> Why do I feel bad for fishman :(
[1:51:09] <+TheHotStuven> yeah
[1:51:10] <AlphaRayAllen> WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS
[1:51:12] <b0nd0fs0uls> do you hink they could bring in aliens to the RE universe at this point and none of the characters would bat an eye at it?
[1:51:15] <MyNameIsRasus> The puzzle was indeed sideways
[1:51:20] <+queaks> This is pretty lovecraftian
[1:51:26] <%pyrojack6> now i'm just waiting on the fanart of him not being a disgusting fish monstrosity
[1:51:28] <eiyuusyndrome> innsmouth baby
[1:51:28] <reddpop_> new londo?
[1:51:28] <+Buzzkill983> A Village maybe
[1:51:31] <Robot_Nixon_> Maybe a ... village Kappa
[1:51:31] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Between Moreau and Irving, who's got the worst deal?
[1:51:34] <%ringabal> This is JUST the Bloodborne fish village
[1:51:36] <+rbakervv> @EbolaBeetle yep, the black spot couldn't move, it was your point of refernce
[1:51:37] <%jorniev> violated village vives
[1:51:38] <%dekkitout> A whole hamlet, of fishermen
[1:51:39] <$DyslexicWizrad> sry chat, is this console or PC?
[1:51:40] <neodeluxe_> HOW
[1:51:41] <Vertigheist> it's that town from bloodborne
[1:51:43] <+andreeg24> @EbolaBeetle yea, the puzzle was sideways.  it had an arrow and everything
[1:51:43] <neodeluxe_> IS THAT READABLE AT ALL
[1:51:44] <+Vigonept> fishing village
[1:51:44] <cynopterus> its not unheard of for towns to be flooded so a resevoir could be put in
[1:51:44] <nazzynoeyes> This IS the fishing village from The Old Hunters
[1:51:45] <%walternatorz> how can anything be legible
[1:51:47] <ShiningAxis> water resistant paper
[1:51:47] <%pyrojack6> askeded
[1:51:49] <critiquequartz> I think aliens would lose
[1:51:49] <%condemned_15> that's what usually happens when dams are installed. It fucks over the small towns
[1:51:49] <%Frost_Quill> Even if he dies we're still gonna find his corpse.  Ethan hasn't shoves his open hand wound in it's bio goo.
[1:51:51] <Robot_Nixon_> I'm never original FeelsBadMan
[1:51:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> A Town? OR A AVILLAGE
[1:51:52] <jtsoppy137> OH NO
[1:51:52] <MyNameIsRasus> @b0nd0fs0uls "the virus was actually aliens all along" - RE10 probably
[1:51:54] <$SGrim> I mean, the fact he can speak means he has lungs which move gaseous air. Whether he needs additional oxygen from gills is another matter.
[1:51:54] <cardamomo88> DUDE WTF
[1:52:00] <chimeraxmachina> @dyslexicwizrad ps5
[1:52:00] <critiquequartz> I think the re characters would just kill them

[1:52:16] <%Garthunox> Garthunox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Obligatory statement that is false because i was tabbed out and not paying attention
[1:52:17] <$DyslexicWizrad> thanks @chimeraxmachina
[1:52:21] <%Valdorick> Extended Pistol Mags always do

[1:58:08] <+andreeg24> his dad jokes are powering up, one boss at a time
[1:58:09] <%walternatorz> are the yellow ropes climbable?
[1:58:10] <wasdsf> "Some motherfuckers always tryna iceskate uphill"
[1:58:13] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> I would love if he progressively got better at one-liners over the course of the game
[1:58:13] <Blank9> no respect for simps, ethan would HATE leon
[1:58:13] <penitentpendant> Now to loot the arena!
[1:58:14] <HeroToxiko> so does this make Ethan the water god?

[1:58:16] <user_naim> Okay, I’ll him that one
[1:58:19] <Tonicky > Ethan watch a Bond movie learn how one liners work
[1:58:19] <@SoFarFetched> @FiresInJune yeah all his VODs get uploaded to youtube unless its like with the Persona LPs and he cant.
[1:58:20] <Mister_McDerp> that fishman deserved worse
[1:58:21] <pikapie> that was cool
[1:58:21] <cardamomo88> a sad one
[1:58:21] <%livlinn> Disgustang!
[1:58:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Ethan is an asshole
[1:58:21] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> isnt it weird that it flopped over like a monster hunter monster
[1:58:22] <%MugenSandan> Ethan is... learning to quip?
[1:58:22] <cherubs_anonymous> God I can't wait for Heisenberg
[1:58:23] <%HitchhikingThrough> Oh man, has ethan been saying some terrible one-liners?
[1:58:24] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Only Hisenberg is left.
[1:58:25] <ZE_Count> the acid rain was cool
[1:58:25] <dan_g_v> so, in this game the bosses are the boss fused to a big monster thing?
[1:58:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This game has some really cool bosses, huh?
[1:58:26] <TheBlankAce> Anything that lets you dump mines is good
[1:58:34] <slimslimjim88> Has Finger wound become finger WOMB yet?
[1:58:34] <+KilogramHours> AND MOTHER
[1:58:37] <Vertigheist> ethan's a cool dad

[1:58:40] <jtsoppy137> magneto
[1:58:41] <cardamomo88> and mommy miranda
[1:58:41] <+burntwing> it was A boss fight thats for sure
[1:58:42] <+FiresInJune> @SoFarFetched thank you!
[1:58:45] <penitentpendant> Which, from the story makes him a mechahorse?
[1:58:46] <%RetroCop87> RE8 is Ethan's evolution from RE2 Leon to RE4 one-liner Leon
[1:58:47] <%walternatorz> shiny up ahead it looks like
[1:58:48] <%Drunkengen> Now we are out of Blight Town
[1:58:48] <avery__island> i missed onna was it col
[1:58:48] <%TheMattman1313> More like Goodbye-senberg
[1:58:48] <rudiciuscaesar> so is Heisen Seath?
[1:58:49] <%Deft_Thought> Unite the Flame, Ethan.
[1:58:49] <fritz_dacat> Ethan is the tru Dark Soul
[1:58:50] <avery__island> donna
[1:58:50] <AlphaRayAllen> RESTART
[1:58:51] <IntenseNerdRage> So how's Pat been enjoying resident evil 4 remake?
[1:58:51] <%caramelatte1> too late now i think
[1:58:52] <+Vigonept> 1 v 1 heisenberg no items
[1:58:53] <+stralalneopac> beating this in 10 hours seems way more doable now
[1:58:55] <T_Sasquatch> @dan_g_v re bosses always transform into weird shit
[1:58:56] <+Fenris_Alexius> wonder if Heisenberg's area will be comparable to Lady D's
[1:58:56] <%dekkitout> How the hell are you gonna kill a dude who moves metal with his cabeza
[1:58:57] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt you just killed a radicalized incel with a mind of a 6yo with mommy issues
[1:58:58] <cynopterus> can you backtrack or nah?
[1:59:01] <%neroforte177> and the chris boss fight dont forget
[1:59:02] <%walternatorz> nvm mistook light for shiny
[1:59:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> The chest that you can get to if you go around?
[1:59:06] <%coreyyotto> playthrough ruined
[1:59:07] <%weissguard> Not even 2hrs. in. Probably gonna beat it tonight, unless the game pulls a fast one.
[1:59:08] <jaygee303> How long you been playing for
[1:59:08] <+TheBitingIrish> The chest that's ahead of you?
[1:59:08] <LordOfThePoultry> where'd chris and co. go?
[1:59:08] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> real question is where did chris go
[1:59:10] <%RedMageRebel> i see now what people were saying over length, the first bit is long and everything after seems much quicker
[1:59:15] <%Cozy90> !timepalyed
[1:59:19] <%Cozy90> !uptime
[1:59:19] <@Moobot> @Cozy90 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 59m.
[1:59:20] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> tbf out of the 3 only lady D wasn't completely fucked in the head
[1:59:21] <PartyFavors> Lady D obviously had the longest buildup despite being the first. Let's see how the factory goes; Heisenberg wanted to put on a show earlier.
[1:59:23] <%caramelatte1> This is an easy 8 hours game with a little exploration done
[1:59:24] <%MonsterEnvy> Wonder what Hisenberg is going to turn into?
[1:59:24] <$Faustgesicht> Has pat beaten lady Demitriscu?
[1:59:27] <T_Sasquatch> guys you would be an incel if you looked like a biology expirement LUL
[1:59:27] <+TheHotStuven> 116 handgun ammo sheesh
[1:59:31] <dan_g_v> @T_Sasquatch but more of a theme going on, rather than just growing extra limbs and claws and fangs like usual
[1:59:31] <seniormeatbox> Who has his hand worse, Ethan, or the idiot from Outlast?
[1:59:34] <cardamomo88> oh yeah Chris drown fuck him
[1:59:35] <+stralalneopac> When's Chris & The Gang gonna pop up again I wonder
[1:59:36] <missingangle> wow, you already beat the doll person (I missed beginning of stream)? I guess beating this in ~10 hours isn't that out there
[1:59:38] <Hellarussian> was
[1:59:40] <+Vigonept> what of he becomes a gundam
[1:59:43] <+andreeg24> 123 handgun bullets, more than enough to kill anything that moves
[1:59:43] <%Blackleafx> Nice Pie :)
[1:59:45] <TurbulentGun> I wonder if we are going to have another legacy Resident Evil appearance in this game.
[1:59:50] <chimeraxmachina> @redmagerebel was thinking the same think, the castle part feels very differently paced
[1:59:55] <%Ranryu692> a Rose Ceremony, you say? LUL
[1:59:55] <%Valdorick> Ha, 'a rose jar'
[2:00:01] <%Jaxnos> dang dude

[2:03:35] <%RedMageRebel> @TurtlesAndTentacles she was working for a shady company and lied about it, but never cheated on ethan. I think she was just hired as evelines caretaker, not as a researcher or anything
[2:03:37] <%psidefx> Now this is fishing
[2:03:42] <CheesesSliced> No animals are getting it off this game alive
[2:03:43] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> look for the bubbles
[2:03:44] <%RetroCop87> Man, fresh fried catfish is SO GOOD
[2:03:48] <+KilogramHours> cant u see
[2:03:48] <%ringabal> Probably best to get out of the water first

[2:03:59] <%sporeian94> CAtfish pat

[2:04:40] <slimslimjim88> Anyone know if pipebombs into the mouth get a unique thing for the last fight
[2:04:42] <%MonsterEnvy> Maybe you have to go to the lab
[2:04:45] <TheMadBadger> Shoot the cadou
[2:04:46] <%Stuzilla21> blow the wall up
[2:04:47] <%Jaxnos> of existence
[2:04:47] <twohitgood> timestop
[2:04:47] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe the goo was blocking a tunnel?
[2:04:48] <+A_Zealous_Retort> from the south?
[2:04:51] <TheMadBadger> that'd be my guess
[2:04:51] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt The lab maybe
[2:04:52] <critiquequartz> Reminder you can catch catfish by letting it bite you and then pulling it out of the water with your hand in its mouth
[2:05:03] <%Stuzilla21> blow the wall
[2:05:05] <Gorgs7> Wasn't it a Moreau thing though?
[2:05:14] <%RetroCop87> It's actually called VORE
[2:05:14] <+superkeaton> sometimes, the catfish wins
[2:05:14] <Ethel9727> Is noodlin' how you caught Zangief?
[2:05:14] <+Punchasaur> Get the varia suit
[2:05:15] <ivanmistwalker> really?
[2:05:16] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt why does ethan still have his jacket sleeve on if it got sliced off
[2:05:20] <+CursedNobleman> also a great way to lost something to a snapping turtle
[2:05:21] <%dekkitout> Careful though, catfish do have venomous barbs
[2:05:21] <T_Sasquatch> its called ew wtf
[2:05:27] <+queaks> Elevator loading sections
[2:05:28] <+necrocannibal2> this is just like Dark Souls
[2:05:30] <%walternatorz> I could see Pat livin' off the bayou
[2:05:30] <%Gogogolem> Hey why did the herbs heal ethans jacket?
[2:05:33] <critiquequartz> Yes
[2:05:35] <onslaught714> noodlin seems to be a good way to get the ol ethan special
[2:05:35] <$Ziegsy> you can do the same thing with squirrels! or babies!
[2:05:37] <+Vigonept> biocatfish
[2:05:38] <CheesesSliced> Pig 🎯 Goat 🎯 Chicken 🎯 Fish 🎯
[2:05:40] <Frostydough1> that boy was trying to noodlin giefy
[2:05:41] <%bhp_99> Don't catfish have barbs in them that you gotta take out before eating?
[2:05:43] <%Jaxnos> so Chris just watched that mess go down instead of helping Ethan, huh?
[2:05:45] <%RedMageRebel> did plague teach you about the catfish
[2:05:47] <%bassoontyphoon> Is this killing floor
[2:05:51] <Mister_McDerp> Ethan has a biojacket
[2:05:52] <+Punchasaur> Catfish eat poop

[2:09:56] <+andreeg24> passed scrap near the back of the of the house

[2:14:16] <+stralalneopac> nevermind
[2:14:17] <AthenaAegis> We need an RE spinoff of these ball puzzles
[2:14:19] <%Deft_Thought> Is Capcom trying to get you to play Pachinko?

[2:14:28] <%pyrojack6> CASTE IN THE NAME OF GOD
[2:14:31] <%RetroCop87> these minigames are dumb, I love them
[2:14:34] <penitentpendant> I mean, it's not really a 'puzzle' but I appreciate the short pacing shift

[2:14:47] <+A_Zealous_Retort> ethan just cheat and put the ball in the hole your daughter is waiting
[2:14:47] <umbraawitch> just grab the ball and put it in the hole POG
[2:14:48] <%Jaxnos> i know this isn't pinball, but i'd do it
[2:14:55] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt The MAGnum uses MAGnesium
[2:14:56] <+Fep3> this new super monkey ball is amazing
[2:14:58] <a_mad_dragon_> just zelda the ball right into the goal 4Herad

[2:29:29] <cynopterus> are there fish?
[2:29:32] <+TheBitingIrish> Look under table
[2:29:42] <+KilogramHours> Yellow right?
[2:29:42] <%HitchhikingThrough> Yeah noticed that during the boss fight
[2:29:44] <$SGrim> @CheesesSliced strike downwards while pressing on the end of the handle with your remaining thumb.
[2:29:49] <Nova712> if it has yellow on it, it's destructable
[2:29:50] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> maybe the wall the mine was near?
[2:29:50] <cardamomo88> wall?
[2:29:52] <+Chi_Thuggery> pipe bomb maybe
[2:29:55] <%walternatorz> second playthrough!
[2:29:56] <%HitchhikingThrough> Those sludge walls did not look like they were breaking
[2:29:59] <seniormeatbox> Try tongue but hole
[2:30:00] <penitentpendant> At least the important treasure was gotten
[2:30:01] <%RetroCop87> all these doors swinging both ways disturbs me
[2:30:08] <KaiserMario> MAybe alongside the wall of the hole?
[2:30:10] <%Deft_Thought> They gave you a pipe bomb but that's not necessarily a clear indicator
[2:30:19] <%bassoontyphoon> This game could really use psychostimulants
[2:30:20] <+BedHome> bisexual doors
[2:30:20] <jbmay> you done goofed
[2:30:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Large Chest Ahead
[2:30:21] <%RetroCop87> it's distracting
[2:30:23] <HeroToxiko> ?
[2:30:24] <+michingmallecho> Jebaited
[2:30:25] <seniormeatbox> reelisteic
[2:30:25] <no123450n> bisexual doors
[2:30:26] <deviljhojho_> you lack the will to know
[2:30:27] <AlphaRayAllen> We nitpick, it's what we do
[2:30:28] <bedhouse> romanian doors
[2:30:29] <Lutre> BisexualPride BisexualPride BisexualPride
[2:30:29] <+stralalneopac> not natural innit
[2:30:30] <%Valdorick> Bisexual doors
[2:30:30] <%walternatorz> bi joke?
[2:30:30] <%condemned_15> it's called being bisexual, Pat
[2:30:32] <%illusiveSaint> LUL
[2:30:32] <MyNameIsRasus> it weird
[2:30:33] <+KilogramHours> im an engineer dammit
[2:30:34] <+tigerfang86> cause we have nothing to look forward to in life, pat
[2:30:34] <cardamomo88> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:30:34] <%JoshManVGH> It's such a video game thing
[2:30:35] <%crimsonharvest> Real doors don't do anything like these doors
[2:30:35] <%HitchhikingThrough> It's really hard to make a door that opens both ways
[2:30:37] <+Fenris_Alexius> because that's not how doors work
[2:30:37] <+gruff_gridof> immersion
[2:30:37] <+michingmallecho> Chat be weird nakkiShocked
[2:30:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> Because why would they?
[2:30:38] <%Frost_Quill> Now to find the big chest on the map.
[2:30:38] <fatalDestiny> It ruins my immersion
[2:30:39] <%Maids4lyfe> doors aren't supposed to do that
[2:30:39] <%maenos2> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[2:30:40] <2midgetsinacoat> The doors are European
[2:30:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Doors don't work like that
[2:30:42] <CheesesSliced> @sgrim that's some powerful grip strength there
[2:30:42] <+TensecondTarvis> they dont really do that IRL unless designed to
[2:30:42] <deviljhojho_> it just gives me conniptions
[2:30:43] <%livlinn> PrideLaugh PrideLaugh PrideLaugh
[2:30:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> That also stays flush I mean
[2:30:44] <+andreeg24> the doors open in a way that many consider to be....unnatural
[2:30:45] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Its against god will
[2:30:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> It is.
[2:30:45] <dbag202> Door IRL tho
[2:30:46] <%MonsterEnvy> yes
[2:30:46] <neodeluxe_> "MY IMMERSION IS RUINED!"
[2:30:46] <AthenaAegis> Paige doors
[2:30:47] <%sniffy77> The doors have Satan's hinges
[2:30:47] <ShiningAxis> maybe half of us work on doors for a living
[2:30:49] <+BigBruthaThunda> CoolStoryBob
[2:30:49] <seniormeatbox> no its just expensive
[2:30:50] <vonmaultke> Door hinges tend to be on one side or the other of the frame
[2:30:51] <NicholasKane> yeah hinges are wierd
[2:30:52] <ZE_Count> Being Bi like Harry
[2:30:52] <Oxybe> THE FEAT
[2:30:53] <MonsieurHedge> Door animation is a huge-ass thing in video games
[2:30:53] <+Fenris_Alexius> Hard to make a door that opens both ways and keeps any cold out
[2:30:53] <critiquequartz> Doors usually just swing one way
[2:30:53] <iosephe> relatively
[2:30:53] <+Vigonept> hinges
[2:30:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes
[2:30:56] <+MightyDuckShoes> Versatile Doors
[2:30:56] <%Ranryu692> do you not know how hinges work?
[2:30:57] <%Valdorick> Hinges do hate swinging wide.
[2:30:57] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, the frames stop doors from going both ways
[2:30:57] <auraofdawn> i dont care for door realism lmao
[2:30:59] <fuji_92> not hard, just unusual
[2:30:59] <penitentpendant> Door hinges cause physics restrictions
[2:30:59] <dinnydanny777> Old Yharnam? limesO
[2:31:00] <Oxybe> THE FEAR
[2:31:00] <%Dr_DangerPhD> devs do that so they only need to do one door opening animation and enemy logic doesn't get fucked at doorways
[2:31:00] <MonsieurHedge> like when making a game, doors are a living hell
[2:31:01] <%MuffledEurobeat> ALL doors are saloon doors
[2:31:01] <user_naim> Those doors suck in real life
[2:31:01] <+ChrisAlgoo> oh yeah this is a souls game
[2:31:02] <+gruff_gridof> fake door store
[2:31:03] <rudiciuscaesar> it's a safety/movement control thing
[2:31:04] <%RetroCop87> if a door opens both ways, it's not a door, it's a gate
[2:31:06] <%neroforte177> it takes me out of how realistic the game is
[2:31:09] <%Maids4lyfe> pat look at the door frame in your house
[2:31:09] <slimslimjim88> Quit reading my mind
[2:31:09] <%VoidBaronJules> chandelier physics
[2:31:12] <%JoshManVGH> Double hinges are a thing but they aren't great for outdoor doors
[2:31:13] <+kawachipto> this puzzle is cool
[2:31:15] <%Arweynn> put out that light, human
[2:31:16] <%solracc25> dungeon
[2:31:17] <Nova712> i imagine it won't seal very well because of the two way hinge
[2:31:19] <LeeOhX> Jobmate1
[2:31:21] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> more physics puzzles, yay!
[2:31:25] <umbraawitch> anybody in this chat smoke weed?
[2:31:25] <dbag202> Yeah cause this game feels real
[2:31:26] <%Jaxnos> p h y s i c s

[2:31:34] <%Jaxnos> pendulum that bad boi
[2:31:37] <+BedHome> shoot it
[2:31:37] <+BigBruthaThunda> TheIlluminati
[2:31:39] <%RetroCop87> Play Initial D music to that swinging lantern
[2:31:41] <no123450n> use your fire arrows
[2:31:41] <dinnydanny777> What if you line it up and fire an arrow
[2:31:43] <%MonsterEnvy> Hit the ones close
[2:31:45] <%condemned_15> there's torches on the sides
[2:31:46] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> shoot it
[2:31:46] <seniormeatbox> Dabadabadooba dead

[2:31:50] <+Vigonept> realistic biomold
[2:31:50] <CheesesSliced> Just get some real fake doors
[2:31:50] <+queaks> This game really makes you FEEL like ethan winters
[2:31:51] <%jorniev> JESUS ETHAN JUST MAKE A TORCH
[2:31:53] <sweatch0> get a stick
[2:31:54] <neodeluxe_> Now this is a physics puzzle
[2:31:54] <dinnydanny777> Din's fire might work
[2:31:55] <%Maids4lyfe> have to gun
[2:31:58] <+Delenay> just shoot it
[2:32:02] <TheMadBadger> Oh i've seen this in Legend of Zelda. You need to shoot your arrow through the fire and onto the other brazier
[2:32:05] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt these fire puzzles make me pine for the days of arrows and sticks
[2:32:11] <LeeOhX> just stab it I guess
[2:32:13] <@SoFarFetched> HIT THE PINATA
[2:32:13] <dinnydanny777> What if Ethan just went outside and picked up a stick
[2:32:16] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao this looks dumb
[2:32:18] <+zee_generate> Ethan my boy, why doesnt he just take a burning stick.
[2:32:19] <@SoFarFetched> CANDY MIGHT COME OUT
[2:32:19] <%solracc25> fire bullet
[2:32:21] <Stillchr> treat it like a tetherball
[2:32:21] <dbag202> Build momentum maybe?
[2:32:22] <%HitchhikingThrough> @umbraawitch steve yockey dies again?
[2:32:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I would just shoot it
[2:32:24] <seniormeatbox> pat use your body
[2:32:24] <rudiciuscaesar> stab to go forward?
[2:32:26] <sweatch0> pendulum
[2:32:28] <%ringabal> Imagine watching a man do this in real life
[2:32:29] <lloyddboy> is this The Raytracing Room?
[2:32:29] <Hellarussian> I cant believe you've done this
[2:32:29] <LeeOhX> Ethan just grab the bottom
[2:32:29] <Scamsy> these puzzles are really dumb
[2:32:32] <no123450n> what if ethan just went home

[2:32:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think Pat needs to come back with the wooden gun

[2:40:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Wait they said the source, does that mean that Evelyn was just a part of that.
[2:40:26] <%walternatorz> that was  a trip
[2:40:26] <+BedHome> IS MIRANDA MIAS MOM
[2:40:26] <+JaseAdrift> you never know
[2:40:26] <+mcjimbo12> so are we to assume this is just naturally occurring? is this the ORIGINAL gross bioweapon that birthed umbrella?
[2:40:28] <wasdsf> Moldspiracy
[2:40:30] <%Monkeyweed21> GET THE FLAMERS
[2:40:30] <neodeluxe_> Maybe Miranda's child is the original Eve?
[2:40:32] <$bognugget> i cant believe im actually this interested in an re plot
[2:40:32] <MyNameIsRasus> you can't spell miranda without mia
[2:40:32] <%Frost_Quill> Did you get all the fish?  Someone else asked.
[2:40:32] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt might be why they gave you like 10 flash rounds in that room?
[2:40:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Is Chris Evil or no?
[2:40:36] <%AllenDeadman> this place is fucked
[2:40:37] <%Xevtes> to the BEAST !!!!
[2:40:38] <HeroToxiko> @Ranryu692 Evelyn is/was the physical manifestation of the mold
[2:40:39] <%RetroCop87> you could totally mod this to be a Dark Souls game
[2:40:42] <binku_muja_> @MonsterEnvy despite my aggravation, I am not disagreeing with what you are saying. It was just pathetic how they abruptly ended the level with no real payoff.
[2:40:42] <greencapps> ramrods are needed for sure
[2:40:42] <%JoshManVGH> Man, are you going to have to fight the molded again?
[2:40:43] <TheMadBadger> They're gonna use Rose's powers to "return to her original form" on the mutamycete to resurrect Mother Miranda's daughter!
[2:40:43] <Sigma_190_Beta> Or like a mold that might have been found.
[2:40:44] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt this area is optional?
[2:40:44] <%ejackalope> was mia conspiring with miranda this entire time??/
[2:40:46] <CrazyMedicine> let's nuke this place
[2:40:46] <notsoy> jesus that's more pistol ammo than you can carry in most FPSs
[2:40:47] <+KilogramHours> Chris seems not great
[2:40:49] <cardamomo88> she says her kid is dead
[2:40:49] <%Deft_Thought> Better hope Chris but the Albert-01
[2:40:51] <CheesesSliced> Chris is evil af
[2:40:52] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt This might've been what Mia was heading towards initially
[2:40:52] <42nfl19> And we STILL don have a way back to the castle
[2:40:53] <jbmay> big problem. big big problem.
[2:40:55] <%illusiveSaint> you need a big flamethrower
[2:40:56] <%AllenDeadman> gonna have to bomb the place from orbit
[2:40:56] <+TheHotStuven> optional LORE
[2:40:57] <dbag202> I feel like Chris is still good, just an asshole for not saying anything
[2:40:58] <+Fenris_Alexius> @PatStaresAt When is the setting of a RE game not fucked
[2:40:58] <HeroToxiko> @TurtlesAndTentacles Evil does reside within so who knows
[2:40:59] <seniormeatbox> Nuke it from orbit
[2:41:00] <+Skye_Logan> lol "might be" fucked
[2:41:03] <user_naim> So Evelyn was Mirandas old kid, and she wants Rose as new kid?
[2:41:04] <+tigerfang86> LORE zone
[2:41:06] <+Vigonept> eve true daughter
[2:41:08] <+Delenay> he seems to be unwilling to explain. no time, shoot first
[2:41:08] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's a problem that needs a Nuke.
[2:41:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> What id I miss? Why are people saying Chris is evil?
[2:41:14] <%Blackleafx> from orbit
[2:41:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's a nuke problem now.
[2:41:16] <+superkeaton> I mean, there's nobody left alive,s o fuck it
[2:41:17] <+KilogramHours> Chris needs to put some respect on Ethan's name
[2:41:17] <%Blackleafx> its the only way to be sure
[2:41:17] <+TheBitingIrish> Are there any places where RE games occur that WEREN'T fucked?
[2:41:19] <+andreeg24> nuke it from orbit.  it's the only way to be sure
[2:41:19] <%psidefx> Good plan
[2:41:19] <%MonsterEnvy> @binku_muja_ "Donna has the ability to control the dolls and lives through the Cadou by dividing it among her dolls. As a result of her mutation, she has suffered debilitating mental illness. Furthermore, her mutation allows her to secrete a pheromone which controls plants infected by the mutamycete. She can also cause hallucinations to whoever inhaled the pollens of the infected plants."
[2:41:21] <%RetroCop87> shame

[2:47:19] <%HitchhikingThrough> Cut for RE4R
[2:47:19] <+SilverDevilfish> "A Hoonter must Hoont Ethan"
[2:47:20] <dinnydanny777> Imagine Ada saying a hoonter must hoont
[2:47:20] <MonsieurHedge> she's too busy smooching leon
[2:47:20] <+Delenay> but leon isnt here so she has to be cut for the dlc

[2:47:26] <Guardiansaiyan> @Frost_Quill conflicting scenarios apparently
[2:47:28] <%pyrojack6> Ada The Crow would've been the dumbest ever
[2:47:30] <connerhozer> Ada Wong was supposed to be Grey Fox of the game
[2:47:30] <$Ziegsy> ada is the most ridiculous char in this now I feel
[2:47:34] <%JoshManVGH> Does she talk about her cool dork of a husband getting into similar bullshit?
[2:47:35] <Hellarussian> fish?
[2:47:35] <%Jaxnos> i wonder if they cut her cuz Ada being involved in things has the implications

[3:01:55] <+Ilpala> "Got enough for like 18 more of you without even getting my real guns out"
[3:02:01] <IminyourBase> he was free

[3:02:03] <%ejackalope> he was psoing for you and everything

[3:02:25] <IminyourBase> too much ammo?

[3:02:31] <butcherbirb> @RetroCop87 just piss your pants
[3:02:32] <binku_muja_> Although, it could be as Pat suggested. Maybe it started out as a cult and Spencer decided to monopolize on that sh-t.
[3:02:34] <+KilogramHours> WOAH
[3:02:38] <MusouMiko> yo
[3:02:38] <MonsieurHedge> i wonder if Ethan's gonna grow his fingers back

[3:03:15] <slimslimjim88> Can you show it again I was reading chat
[3:03:18] <MyNameIsRasus> if you gotta be a pro gamer to do it how come you did it?
[3:03:19] <fritz_dacat> Your Years of RE knowlege are really paying off
[3:03:19] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt I think all of chat blinked and missed it

[3:03:29] <cynopterus> is this gonna be like that shitty area in evil within
[3:03:31] <%Frost_Quill> There's gonna be another big guy isn't there.
[3:03:42] <%RetroCop87> I will say, this blows Sadler's hideout out of the water
[3:03:44] <%saadi90> There is one to parry an arrow with a knife
[3:03:52] <%Jaxnos> oh, we saw this area when they showed off the arcade mode
[3:03:52] <rudiciuscaesar> woah, this looks like that shitty area from Evil Within 1
[3:03:59] <MyNameIsRasus> this DOES look like that shitty area  in evil within
[3:04:02] <+TheHotStuven> Someones here with a gun monkaS
[3:04:06] <rudiciuscaesar> where Seabass and Joe Oda get arrowed
[3:04:10] <seniormeatbox> @rudiciuscaesar So all of The Evil Within 1?
[3:04:13] <+Mitchellsocks> This has turned into Doom
[3:04:21] <rReizs> need an announcer that goes "GUN PARRY" "TRIPLE KILL"
[3:04:21] <+ChrisAlgoo> someone put doom eternal music over this
[3:04:24] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Will Ethan get as powerful as Chris and Leon then have to be shelved for a new protag because of being too powerful?
[3:04:29] <%baka_sugoi> ***
[3:04:31] <KingSpunf> That's the secret: The Evil Within is always shitty areas
[3:04:40] <%MandMGrease> Were they tying for an Apache ambush?
[3:04:42] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah something big is coming
[3:04:45] <%Jaxnos> Hammer Lycan time?
[3:04:45] <+rorschachsjournal505> So how does this stack compared to the best the franchise has to offer so far?
[3:04:47] <rudiciuscaesar> @seniormeatbox no, not all, Joe goes missing and Kidman is around but yeah lol
[3:04:49] <%ringabal> Look at this Mercenaries Map
[3:04:52] <%RetroCop87> NO
[3:04:54] <%PhantomMiG> Big hammer guy calling it
[3:04:54] <IminyourBase> they sound like running water
[3:04:55] <+kawachipto> game becomes re4 in terms of fighting now
[3:04:55] <BlueLunecy> Hard to miss em
[3:04:57] <%AllenDeadman> a murder of crows indeed
[3:04:57] <%bottom_feeder88> just wait til ethan gets his bionic fingers
[3:05:02] <+Javaa01> Kinda hard not to hear them
[3:05:02] <user_naim> @chrisalgoo Resident Evil: The Ancie t Gods
[3:05:02] <+mcjimbo12> @troxvon_the_lesser ethan has already tanked way more damage than every RE protag put together and honestly after the FUCKIN DRAGON he's probably got some of the most impressive kills
[3:05:03] <+Punchasaur> Doom at %10 the speed
[3:05:04] <%TheMattman1313> This feels like the run up to the final boss in 4
[3:05:05] <+Mitchellsocks> THINK Ethan THINK
[3:05:07] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> no, what crows ?
[3:05:07] <dinnydanny777> Crows are a symbol of death limesHmm
[3:05:07] <%RetroCop87> shoot them
[3:05:08] <+TheHotStuven> you have a flash bang?>
[3:05:13] <%HitchhikingThrough> suplex when
[3:05:16] <%bottom_feeder88> and now he can hit up his backup girl of Zoe

[3:05:17] <slimslimjim88> Winter must be.. here already
[3:05:29] <%AllenDeadman> wellp
[3:05:30] <toahmes> haven't killed big ol' werewolf boy yet have we?
[3:05:31] <BlueLunecy> Aren't these the ruins where you fought Krauser?

[3:06:04] <youngin_______420> How the games going ?
[3:06:05] <+TheHotStuven> Nice
[3:06:05] <sw_paladin> did someone say MOB RUSH?
[3:06:10] <+superkeaton> jesus Ethan is kicking ass
[3:06:13] <%AzureGale> This looks like an Unreal Tournament level
[3:06:13] <+reinbachthe3rd> 1911 shredding these werewolves.
[3:06:21] <%Jaxnos> what a terrible archer, he dropped his bow
[3:06:24] <+Ilpala> shooting gallery reached
[3:06:25] <2midgetsinacoat> Ethan is a big tough guy
[3:06:26] <%PhantomMiG> Notice that so far no full auto weapons
[3:06:32] <%bottom_feeder88> likely unlimited spawns
[3:06:34] <slimslimjim88> Get leid
[3:06:35] <+ChaosAethr> Lets party
[3:06:35] <%ringabal> It's over, Heisenburg! I have the high ground!

[3:06:38] <+reinbachthe3rd> @superkeaton They shouldn't have taken his daughter.
[3:06:41] <+Vigonept> ethan on his path to be guts
[3:06:46] <%blutzwavedave> If Ethan doesn't say "Lycan you give me a break?" at some point, I'll riot
[3:06:48] <Mattais88> OMG is the reason Ethan is missing two fingers so he only has  8?
[3:06:51] <verscoll> damnnn
[3:06:55] <Sjotyme_> some Doom elements here
[3:06:58] <%walternatorz> headshots are so satisfying
[3:07:00] <brainflint> cod zombies be lookin weird these days
[3:07:00] <%ejackalope> ethan must have gotten some training eh?
[3:07:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> Ethan on his way to Griffith.
[3:07:05] <+Punchasaur> Werewolves seem a lot less threatening than they should be
[3:07:06] <the_vainglory> Well done!
[3:07:06] <%RetroCop87> other lever
[3:07:07] <Link232> Don't you still have like, 10 pipe bombs in your inventory
[3:07:11] <%AzureGale> Anyone think the weapon switching animation is a little odd? It looks like Ethan has four arms :x
[3:07:11] <jbmay> hey pat. with how cool this game looks and how similar it kind of is to re4, do you think we really need an re4 remake?
[3:07:13] <%Dante_Magnum> ethan: insane killing machine.
[3:07:14] <%bottom_feeder88> he did, its at the start of the game
[3:07:17] <%bottom_feeder88> chris got him trained
[3:07:20] <dinnydanny777> @mattais88 Oh no NotLikeThis LUL
[3:07:24] <Shardlab> We got mega barrel bombs for everyone!!!
[3:07:26] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> not for long
[3:07:26] <notsoy> but what if he needs the pipebombs later D:
[3:07:28] <+superkeaton> @Punchasaur they were a lot tougher at the start of the game
[3:07:28] <%RetroCop87> but what if you need them for a murder of crows?
[3:07:28] <+Ilpala> right by your pistol
[3:07:30] <seniormeatbox> Is the magnum a fucking civil war remmington?
[3:07:31] <BlueBiscuitGT> I don't think a rural village has enough people to make this many lycans
[3:07:31] <binku_muja_> Question: How do they have this many enemies when the villages in the surrounding area could not have supported the numbers?
[3:07:32] <%Jaxnos> Ethan isn't allowed to make terrible puns if i can't see his shit-eating grin while he does it
[3:07:34] <KingSpunf> Ethan picks up a big gun and turns to face the enemy: "I'm Lycan these odds!"
[3:07:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> They are by your handgun.
[3:07:39] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Did you notice so far no automatic weapons do you think that was a dev choice
[3:07:40] <MonsieurHedge> this attache case is wildly unorganized
[3:07:51] <+ALazo> I like how you are just mowing them down now, when at the start of the game they were sorta threatening
[3:07:54] <+steven19913> magnum looks like a colt single action army to me
[3:07:55] <PlumpPotatoRump> @binku_muja_ This game contains Biomagic
[3:07:58] <%JoshManVGH> @azuregale BioCurse Combat Configuration: Asura Ethan on the field.
[3:07:58] <+KilogramHours> And its like the last weapon
[3:07:59] <+superkeaton> Unless it's the TMP
[3:08:00] <seniormeatbox> @PatStaresAt is the magnum an 1860s revolver
[3:08:02] <%kujofire990> TMP BABY
[3:08:04] <jtsoppy137> good old TMP
[3:08:04] <%Valdorick> But the TMP though!
[3:08:04] <%fimbulwinters> making everything grey in your inventory makes things harder to distinguish
[3:08:05] <dbag202> Why are the Auto's bad?
[3:08:05] <MonsieurHedge> god I hope there's a end sequence where you just get the TMP
[3:08:08] <oda_flobunaga> Metro has a few
[3:08:11] <dinnydanny777> @binku_muja_ Sometimes they come out of the ground, could be dead bodies
[3:08:12] <%Monkeyweed21> that handgun is auto
[3:08:14] <MusouMiko> when are we getting the riot sweeper tho
[3:08:20] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I love the Castle in back ground
[3:08:21] <MonsieurHedge> like in the same place where you would get the rocket launcher or acid ammo, BOOM TMP
[3:08:23] <Aydarkzero> the tmp is only needed in professional mode
[3:08:26] <seniormeatbox> usually the automatic weapon is saved for the last segment of the game
[3:08:26] <%Treuan> and then there's the infinite ammo tommy gun
[3:08:27] <+Gespens> Atrocious as in they are bad in performance, or do not fit the game?
[3:08:28] <%bassoontyphoon> That’s why re4 is trash since it has a tmp
[3:08:28] <user_naim> The TMP requires RE4 around it
[3:08:29] <%bottom_feeder88> what were the machine pistols in CVX?
[3:08:30] <%RetroCop87> that's a boss
[3:08:32] <%condemned_15> chest?
[3:08:32] <Sigma_190_Beta> Go back there.
[3:08:33] <KingSpunf> don't be talking shit about the TMP
[3:08:34] <+Punchasaur> I don’t think these bio weapons are that big a deal if one guy with a few guns who moves at the speed of molasses can deal with it
[3:08:35] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> look at that boss room
[3:08:36] <tanarath> @patstaresat tmp staggers granados in one shot to the knee
[3:08:38] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt slightly disappointed that the strongest enemy so far has been "Big axe butcher man"
[3:08:38] <cosmicgoatee> boss
[3:08:39] <Daxalog> Even in Dead space
[3:08:41] <serkiimouse> @DeepSearch27 harder to conserve ammo in a game with that as a core mechanic
[3:08:43] <+kawachipto> @monkeyweed21 he hasn't gotten there yet
[3:08:45] <%Frost_Quill> Is this progress or an optional area?
[3:08:45] <oda_flobunaga> When ammo is scarce, shooting 20 rounds in one second is BAD
[3:08:45] <%Valdorick> I did a TMP only run in RE4. Its very good at clearing trash, but trash at fighting bosses
[3:08:49] <%RetroCop87> miss any gold drops?
[3:08:51] <%walternatorz> only spend 1 year
[3:08:53] <rudiciuscaesar> imagine if the Arkham games told you if shit was under or inside something
[3:08:54] <seniormeatbox> pipe bomb
[3:08:57] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat I think at this point in RE7 you got the submachine gun as Mia
[3:08:58] <+D00msDayDan> imagine using the pulse rifle in dead space
[3:08:59] <Ravioli_Ronin> Pulse rifle can eat my ass
[3:08:59] <rudiciuscaesar> looking at you, Arkham Asylum specifically
[3:09:00] <%bevyrage> @DeepSearch27 a lot of ammo to kill even the most basic enemy, takes up a lot of space, and just overall less good than basic pistol even by default
[3:09:06] <42nfl19> pipe bomb lol
[3:09:06] <sw_paladin> you get it later Pat just fyi
[3:09:08] <SirhcMachineStrongMan> Would does Semi-Auto mean? I don't anything about real guns.
[3:09:12] <+superkeaton> @rudiciuscaesar I fucking wish they did that for Knight
[3:09:13] <cynopterus> it says under it so maybe you get to go underground?
[3:09:13] <user_naim> @rudiciuscaesar lol
[3:09:15] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> auto guns take away the immersion I cant really explain
[3:09:17] <KingSpunf> time to fall through a floor
[3:09:19] <%MandMGrease> "We're within a few feet of it.  Horizontally."
[3:09:23] <+ChaosAethr> has more action
[3:09:24] <MyNameIsRasus> and re7 wasn't even bad
[3:09:24] <RabbitOTM> I like weird.
[3:09:25] <Matoryis> whats the spooky level of this game so far
[3:09:25] <%RetroCop87> to be fair, RE7 was amazing for a return to form
[3:09:26] <+KilogramHours> @PatStaresAt Bosses are very better than RE7. Jack Baker was like the only good boss.
[3:09:27] <fatalDestiny> What if the treasure is on top of the stronghold, but it's called the 'Treasure Under the Stronghold"?
[3:09:28] <seniormeatbox> @PatStaresAt do you want RE9 to be first person as well to complete the 3 game camera angle trend?
[3:09:28] <%Frost_Quill> RE is at it's best when it's super weird.
[3:09:30] <+TheHotStuven> this game is amazing so far, love watching it
[3:09:33] <%condemned_15> it's weird how far this franchise has come
[3:09:33] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> @sirhcmachinestrongman go boomboom instead of bang, bang
[3:09:35] <%Monkeyweed21> RE7 didnt have an automatic either
[3:09:36] <%Jaxnos> i like the Baker family more, but i like this village more than the marsh by a lot
[3:09:37] <+funkyjim69> After beating the game it's my 2nd favorite behind RE 2 remake
[3:09:38] <rReizs> semi-auto is shoot once per trigger pull
[3:09:39] <%AzureGale> The sound I make when I poop
[3:09:39] <count_bob> @SirhcMachineStrongMan Each time you pull the trigger, you shoot a bullet.
[3:09:42] <KaiserMario> You know, I always have a soft spot for this gun because it's the gun Jack gets from EVA in mGS3
[3:09:44] <TheMadBadger> @Gespens Usually both. Consume way too much ammo per enemy and you need a lot of ammo to use which goes against survival horror main theme of "Every resource/bullet counts"
[3:09:46] <vilecrois> The molded just arent a very interesting enemy type
[3:09:46] <%fimbulwinters> I want that military training that lets you drop three stories like its the bottom step of a stairwell

[3:09:52] <MusouMiko> boss fountain :9
[3:09:54] <seniormeatbox> its a sign
[3:09:54] <%JoshManVGH> @punchasaur Ethan seems like a special case. Drop the axe dude in an unsuspecting town and some shit will get fucked up.
[3:09:55] <+reinbachthe3rd> Boss fountain?
[3:09:57] <Sjotyme_> a lot of people are saying it's weird
[3:09:59] <+reinbachthe3rd> lol
[3:10:00] <+stralalneopac> @SirhcMachineStrongMan Semi-Auto means it fires as fast as you can keep pulling the trigger. Automatic means you hold the trigger and it shoots.
[3:10:04] <Cpt_phantom> I still have to beat RE7,  but this game looks cool
[3:10:05] <%Blackleafx> hmmmmm
[3:10:06] <SirhcMachineStrongMan> @iShouldBeAtWorklol GunRun hahaha

[3:10:41] <seniormeatbox> Hello Evil Dead 2
[3:10:42] <user_naim> I guess semi-auto just means it automatically loads the next round, but doesnt automatically fire it
[3:10:43] <%Blackleafx> look at this dark souls shit

[3:11:47] <%Valdorick> This is just a DOOM 2016 aerna
[3:11:52] <%AzureGale> DM-Catacombs
[3:11:56] <%pyrojack6> @KingKrampus D was boss #1
[3:12:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> Is Ethan just Doom-Guy at this point?
[3:12:09] <%JoshManVGH> @punchasaur Fair, but look at what happened to the normies in the rest of these places.
[3:12:11] <binku_muja_> @KingKrampus yes, and he breezed through the second 'section.'
[3:12:16] <%HitchhikingThrough> This is a doom arena
[3:12:20] <KingKrampus> @hrbeck_ I read that in the voice of the exterminator from Overly the Hedge
[3:12:29] <+reinbachthe3rd> Ethan: 'RIP AND TEAR'
[3:12:33] <%Blackleafx> needs a meelee attack tho
[3:12:37] <KingKrampus> @hrbeck_ the "let's party" part
[3:12:41] <%AzureGale> When does Ethan learn how to glory kill
[3:12:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is a really unusual RE game in a lot of ways. It's great though, for sure
[3:12:45] <stirlingw17> Needs more Death Metal
[3:12:47] <+Mitchellsocks> Literally a Gore Nest
[3:12:47] <+Punchasaur> The only thing they fear is quickturns
[3:12:51] <slimslimjim88> No longer Ethan winters. Now Ethan GUY
[3:12:52] <%Jaxnos> don't forget to use your fire belch for armor
[3:12:57] <%ringabal> ETHAN, DO A RAINSTORM
[3:12:57] <%Teyaric> Oh hell they deliberately gave Ethan no melee so Leon looks twice as badass when he starts suplexing.
[3:13:00] <Sigma_190_Beta> Were the other two fingers limiters?
[3:13:00] <Hellarussian> the ammo sink
[3:13:01] <%Blackleafx> YOU GOT NO HAD M8
[3:13:01] <PlumpPotatoRump> imagine trying to get back up with no head :)
[3:13:01] <%ejackalope> could these be endless unless you trigger something?
[3:13:01] <%JoshManVGH> Ethan's going to say something like "Now who's the leader of the pack!" at the end of this, I can feel it
[3:13:03] <%Blackleafx> HEAD
[3:13:04] <Cpt_phantom> Getting ready for Ethan to learn how to air dash
[3:13:05] <%baronouroboros> Come to think of it, Ethan is a bit like an Ork in 40K. Made of fungus, able to survive horrible injuries. :P
[3:13:05] <Vertigheist> ethank "wicke" winters
[3:13:07] <the_vainglory> That is such as *satisfying* gun.
[3:13:10] <SirhcMachineStrongMan> @PhantomMiG Hmm, fascinating. Don't revolvers just reset? Or is there such a thing as Semi-Auto Revolvers?
[3:13:11] <allanmiri> I think they're just gonna keep coming until you leave the area.
[3:13:14] <%Gloom_Tangerine> 50 cent would love this place
[3:13:20] <user_naim> Ethan Taggart
[3:13:23] <+stralalneopac> feels weird how they leaned into survival horror in 7 and in 8 they had that but also ETHAN WINTERS MAN OF ACTION
[3:13:25] <cynopterus> ethan left hand really??
[3:13:27] <dinnydanny777> Ethan's melee is a light push
[3:13:29] <KingSpunf> @Valentinius_Anodyne what even IS a usual RE game bynow? Like, what was the last normal RE?

[3:14:17] <+Ilpala> christ that was supposed to be a challenge
[3:14:19] <%baronouroboros> Resident Evil starts as survival horror but quickly turns into action camp. It's RE tradition, I think.
[3:14:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> Ethan is such a good protag.
[3:14:25] <+reinbachthe3rd> Holy shit. Ethan just wiped a den of werewolves. What a mad lad.

[3:14:35] <rudiciuscaesar> if they put Ethan in MvC4 they'd have to censor out his face, blur it or put a redacted over it lmao
[3:14:36] <Shardlab> You made sport of the whole encounter

[3:21:20] <seniormeatbox> Dog Soldiers
[3:21:22] <captainnathaniel> RE and bad one liners. Name a more iconic duo
[3:21:28] <NicholasKane> the optional guy was harder cause pat didnt use the Magnum
[3:21:28] <allanmiri> "I'm not Lycan this!"
[3:21:35] <KaiserMario> Thankfully you used that Magnum, can you imagine how much more ammo it woul've taken to kill that guy?
[3:21:38] <user_naim> Okay, that was fortunately not secret Heisenberg, just a bit hammer man
[3:21:39] <seniormeatbox> Think we can knock out the game tonight?
[3:21:43] <samazam94> i feel like the axe hollow guys took a lot more
[3:21:46] <rReizs> ace combat and silent protagonists
[3:21:47] <slimslimjim88> Maybe it’s a unique for killing with a pipebomb up the butt
[3:21:50] <2midgetsinacoat> @TheAntiNihilist I think Pat was just using up his mines for that guy, instead of magnum
[3:21:51] <%transporterthesequel> Heisenberg was right, that WAS fun, how nice of him
[3:21:55] <%Blackleafx> @seniormeatbox if its another 8 hour stream, yes
[3:21:55] <+andreeg24> i ain't lycan what you mama gave you
[3:22:04] <+Delenay> burg totally used you to clear the wolves out
[3:22:16] <Albedo28> So is this game got re 7 levels of hidden bits and bobs? psaBlind
[3:22:18] <TheAdMerlin> I wonder what the Magnums attachments will be
[3:22:20] <%Frost_Quill> Also possible the other guy's health reset when you left the building.
[3:22:21] <%lemon_rinds> How does urs imply anything about bears?

[3:43:09] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz fuck that asshole
[3:43:10] <%juxtest> Ethan is an honorable stooge
[3:43:11] <%RetroCop87> to be fair, he totally would have killed Ethana nd Rose after
[3:43:13] <munitalprats> He does have morals though
[3:43:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Because ethan is fucking stupid. I legit hate him as a character
[3:43:14] <+andreeg24> sometimes, you just gotta tell the evil guy to suck your sack
[3:43:14] <%AzureGale> LUL
[3:43:15] <%transporterthesequel> you can just LIE
[3:43:15] <zombieKillaKlown> He’s just really into Motörhead
[3:43:15] <$Ziegsy> one too many blows to the head
[3:43:15] <+queaks> He doesnt seem bright enough for deceit
[3:43:15] <GunEden> heroes dont lie
[3:43:17] <%marsantas> Ethan is the dumb
[3:43:18] <allanmiri> That's always the thing about that. Just play along and shoot em in the back later.
[3:43:18] <%MechArch> it would be sick having a bio baby
[3:43:18] <2midgetsinacoat> Ethan is getting cocky
[3:43:19] <+BedHome> ethen has killed dozens of people
[3:43:19] <dinnydanny777> He's married to a fucking bioterrorist
[3:43:19] <Albedo28> Ethan has a case o the dumbs

[3:43:21] <+KilogramHours> WOODEN GUN
[3:43:22] <signofzeta> never trust a traitor
[3:43:22] <NeroInfinite> because you need to pad the game LUL
[3:43:22] <+JaseAdrift> trusting him would be an awful decision
[3:43:23] <%X2Eliah> Wait, so Ethan needed the four baby parts just to lift a bridge?
[3:43:23] <rudiciuscaesar> choke him out
[3:43:23] <Mister_McDerp> Ethan wants to kill Heisenburg too
[3:43:23] <TheAntiNihilist> That's a Japan thing
[3:43:24] <MyNameIsRasus> with a WOODEN GUN
[3:43:24] <deviljhojho_> Ethan knows haisenberg would fuck him over
[3:43:24] <Jaysky> WODDEN. GUN.

[3:43:25] <+ALazo> just shoot him lol
[3:43:27] <+Mrbaconator> yeah you can keep the morals by betraying heisenberg
[3:43:27] <Ethel9727> Silver bullet or crossbow is my guess
[3:43:27] <%RetroCop87> strangle him?
[3:43:27] <%livlinn> Ethan can't mind game
[3:43:27] <%thbluewarden> ethan 's not very bright
[3:43:27] <connerhozer> Ethan has no grift in him
[3:43:27] <randomahole> because the video game needs to happen
[3:43:28] <reonome> ethan doesn't have morals he's just an idiot
[3:43:28] <+mcjimbo12> i think heisenberg might pull a lucas and survive the base game

[3:43:30] <+Skye_Logan> pyramid head, triangle girl, chopper face
[3:43:30] <oda_flobunaga> Ethan is the PC which means he is god in this universe
[3:43:30] <+loukemia83> Time to invent Plastic bullets
[3:43:30] <%AllenDeadman> Ethan has proven time and time again since RE7 proven to be a complete moron at times
[3:43:31] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe get him to hurt himself with metal?
[3:43:31] <binku_muja_> Ethan's stupidity has not yet reached peak potential. Just wait for it.
[3:43:31] <+EmptyMug> Just punch him
[3:43:32] <%TheMattman1313> Expose him to cold or something
[3:43:32] <$KnivesEve> with a wooden gun. im telling u
[3:43:32] <Sigma_190_Beta> I personally would not trust Heisenberg.
[3:43:33] <LunarRemix> I think Ethan's going to get some kind of power by the end of the game
[3:43:33] <Byorski> Anti-magneto powers
[3:43:33] <KingSpunf> stake through the heart?

[3:43:49] <fuji_92> less magnetic, but still magnetic
[3:43:49] <%ospreyworks> Because Heisenberg is too cool to be an ally. Ethan would have no reason to live anymore if there were a cooler protagonist.

[3:55:01] <+andreeg24> lol, hells yea.  cast a mold of 2 new fingers
[3:55:01] <dinnydanny777> Wait can Ethan get a cyborg hand LUL
[3:55:03] <%HitchhikingThrough> Control
[3:55:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> Missed Rusted Parts
[3:55:03] <reonome> so he can control them i guess
[3:55:04] <+Punchasaur> Make the zombies pointy
[3:55:06] <%marsantas> Probably so he can control them if he wants?
[3:55:07] <%The_Gaming_Karp> They remind me of the stalkers in HL2
[3:55:08] <godzookylives> why not
[3:55:09] <ThatGuyThere03> @SubjectX07x Could be a civilian export version given that it's Europe and all
[3:55:09] <%trustycoyote> So it seems Bloodborne Max was doing some experiments on some people
[3:55:11] <%LouieRouie> Cuz it's COOL
[3:55:11] <%dekkitout> Ya know, if Ethan was nicer to Heisenberg I bet he woulda built Ethan a new hand
[3:55:13] <%livlinn> PrideHeartL BabyRage PrideHeartR
[3:55:13] <%Jaxnos> this is that one sewer hallway in RE2Make

[3:55:21] <SubjectX07x> True.
[3:55:26] <%baronouroboros> So, I'm guessing this is a former umbrella factory?
[3:55:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell yeah what if Ethan gets a cyber hand
[3:55:29] <%Ranryu692> Heisenberg probably has nanomachines, I called it earlier
[3:55:34] <TheBlankAce> Because he can control metal he probably has 100% control over all the dudes he makes
[3:55:34] <PlumpPotatoRump> OMFG IT IS CYBERZOMBIES! hell yessssss!
[3:55:36] <TheMadBadger> Well we saw the picture of the frankensteins monster, right? What if this is all to help resurrect Miranda's dead child and Heisenburg was in charge of making a body
[3:55:36] <Mister_McDerp> gear axe!
[3:55:38] <sothatsprettybrutal> wow getting knocked over by that explosion didn't do shit to them
[3:55:40] <samazam94> so Eisenberg is the Frankenstein stand-in
[3:55:41] <SubjectX07x> Just figured it'd be this games version of the TMP, surprised it's not.
[3:55:42] <%ejackalope> the smoke coming from the barrel is a nice effect i didn't notice earlier
[3:55:43] <haitakaa> so Heisenberg is basically Lucas
[3:55:46] <%X2Eliah> This is a medieval umbrella factory, yes
[3:55:48] <dinnydanny777> Heisenberg is a lot more evil and a lot less cool than I expected

[4:08:31] <Khorneflakes_> LUL that's like a solid block of steel
[4:08:34] <munitalprats> those REACTORS are powered by FISH>
[4:08:34] <nazzynoeyes> Iron man arc reactors?
[4:08:36] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, isn't that a mould and not a mold?
[4:08:37] <+KilogramHours> ALREADY

[4:09:05] <dbag202> Withthe hard "R"
[4:09:09] <%AllenDeadman> sure is
[4:09:11] <%juxtest> No scoped
[4:09:13] <connerhozer> Mold is to Resident Evil what strands are to Death Stranding
[4:09:14] <Chatterbox1991> oh literally reverse
[4:09:14] <deviljhojho_> rodarag
[4:09:14] <+impressionistcowboy> some frankensteins army shit here
[4:09:15] <%Jaxnos> even hitting the core it takes that much
[4:09:15] <reonome> ez
[4:09:18] <+necrocannibal2> this is a Wolfenstein enemy
[4:09:20] <%Jaxnos> christ
[4:09:22] <dan_g_v> boom goes the Zombot

[4:09:33] <umbraawitch> are we in magneto's house?
[4:09:33] <deviljhojho_> this is to fuck with headshoters
[4:09:37] <user_naim> Castle Wolfenstein for sure

[4:09:45] <+ALazo> headshots are for losers. Real men aim for the chest
[4:09:46] <nazzynoeyes> supersoldaten
[4:09:47] <rudiciuscaesar> that would be too hot to even STAND next to
[4:09:55] <+Punchasaur> rodorrag
[4:09:55] <rudiciuscaesar> and super cooling it would destroy it
[4:10:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> A "Glowing weak spot" shot is essentially the same as a headshot
[4:10:04] <+KilogramHours> fucky wucky time
[4:10:06] <%MechArch> you mining crypto down here?
[4:10:11] <2midgetsinacoat> Feel like it's been a consistantly good RE game

[4:12:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is this boss Alex Jones?
[4:12:03] <LordOfThePoultry> yeah thats a good trope
[4:12:03] <Blank9> armstrong's cool if you're stronger and beat him
[4:12:04] <cynopterus> hows it feel  miranda, to be a bitchhh
[4:12:04] <%AllenDeadman> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[4:12:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> at least Gaius was cool about it
[4:12:05] <%OswaldTheDog> god i love the way he talks hooooo man
[4:12:06] <WhatIfDragon> Ethan not dying is cheating
[4:12:06] <connerhozer> “Might rules everything”
[4:12:06] <+impressionistcowboy> lol you just killed 2 of his dudes no problem
[4:12:06] <+NiktenKing> SATURATION

[4:12:08] <dinnydanny777> How the hell is Miranda stronger than this limesS
[4:12:08] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, Power if Everything, t hat's the Titans from Zeta Gundam, that's why Jerid is top tier kappa
[4:12:09] <sosuke5> "power for ME"
[4:12:11] <%sporeian94> Walter at the end of SMT IV says "Since you've won perhaps it means you're in the right"
[4:12:11] <iosephe> Cheating is power
[4:12:14] <rReizs> I NEED MORE QUANTUM POWER
[4:12:14] <$KnivesEve> so Armstrong remains the best
[4:12:14] <%Arweynn> Dantergil
[4:12:15] <pzambarda> thats the power of cheat
[4:12:16] <balthazar758> "you see, as long as i'm winning - wait stop"
[4:12:16] <%dekkitout> *Cut to Heisenberg taking Ethan's Hand*
[4:12:18] <nojjod420> "no! no! I'm not owned" he says as he slowly shrinks into corn
[4:12:18] <LeotheHuntsman> which is why senator armstrong is treat
[4:12:20] <%Jeemukun> looks like dante talks like vergil
[4:12:21] <seniormeatbox> Thats a fucking KILLIG FLOOR MONSTER
[4:12:22] <mar_krow> cyber krasier
[4:12:27] <Ethel9727> Cheating is the ultimate power
[4:12:28] <$floralkami> I'm glad the the lowest point of the game so far has been the dialogue, and just in comparison.
[4:12:32] <Tonicky > some say cheating is the greatest power of all
[4:12:37] <MrRavine> I love the way these guys walk
[4:12:37] <CrystalLightPeachTea> nice counter
[4:12:37] <AlphaRayAllen> Why not just build a metal cover for the power core?
[4:12:39] <2deep5u> but by defeating him you literally prove that power truly is everything
[4:12:42] <NicholasKane> kinda Fatal Frame
[4:12:43] <PumpAction> EZ :D
[4:12:46] <KeiPrime> chiaki in smt3 is the best example, even if you agree wtih her that might makes right, you gotta fight

[4:20:24] <rReizs> i think my neigbours didn't socialize their dog so she barks at anything that passes by the front of their house non-stop
[4:20:36] <deviljhojho_> is this the frankenstein level of the victorian horror theme?
[4:20:52] <deviljhojho_> i thought this guy was all about werewolves
[4:20:53] <rudiciuscaesar> @ElkRiverDog is that because they're brachycephalic? My mom hated doing surgery on bulldogs cuz of that
[4:21:05] <doc_ock_rokc> @deviljhojho_ yes
[4:21:08] <rudiciuscaesar> though my mom says the worst to operate one was any cat

[4:23:23] <%ElkRiverDog> @rudiciuscaesar that and their necks really can’t tolerate narrow pressure. If a collar doesn’t restrict their breathing it hurts their neck/spine
[4:23:32] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> garador but more menacing

[4:25:32] <doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt He is a SON of a bitch pat
[4:25:38] <%AzureGale> "Keep going until complete passing out" is just standard baby operations

[4:26:05] <Blank9> he's complaining about miranda but goddamn, she's decking him out with a hell of a factory
[4:26:07] <%HitchhikingThrough> Those seem really scary until you remember most militaries have guns
[4:26:07] <Samurai_Tchan> why theres like borgs now ?
[4:26:09] <%AllenDeadman> mass produce fairly efficient bio weapons

[4:26:15] <+impressionistcowboy> I wonder how heisenberg lost his medical license
[4:26:17] <%Monkeyweed21> this is more impressive than the Umbrella Labs
[4:26:18] <NeonBleu> Couldnt he just take her out with his literal army?
[4:26:19] <%Broand> These guys are a lot more effective in a typical combat scenario than propellerhead

[4:26:39] <KaiserMario> Just walked by a prompt under the table
[4:26:40] <Samurai_Tchan> why theres mad max goons now ? what happened to the zombinis ?
[4:26:41] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> only efficient if in  enclosed spaces
[4:26:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you missed something under the wrench
[4:26:43] <Blank9> moldy guys in general seem like better bioweapons than zombos and parasites

[4:32:53] <sothatsprettybrutal> i dunno i'm kind of uncertain
[4:32:53] <deviljhojho_> he is named after the breaking bad dude
[4:32:54] <missingangle> You're goddamn right
[4:32:55] <%DashXero> The scientist with the uncertainty principle?
[4:32:56] <rudiciuscaesar> and probably a Saxon, since most of the Germans who immigrated to Romania were from Saxony.
[4:32:56] <%condemned_15> nah. definitely Breaking Bad

[4:36:27] <%walternatorz> at least he's consistent
[4:36:27] <samazam94> so if Dimitrescu and Eisenberg are Dracula and Frankenstein respectively, what named gothic horror literature character the other two are based on?
[4:36:28] <sothatsprettybrutal> he really likes to say "bitch"
[4:36:29] <Smokin_Fish> Is that Nic Cage?

[4:36:31] <%AllenDeadman> sure is
[4:36:31] <rudiciuscaesar> OHHHH Heisenberg is German, like Viktor Frankenstein
[4:36:32] <deviljhojho_> it wasnt that subtle i suppose tho
[4:36:32] <boogaleeboo> Reminder: This guy has a massive army of these guys and *still* doesn't feel like he can take her
[4:36:32] <MrRavine> Characters in this game really like saying bitch :)
[4:36:33] <%MonsterEnvy> Honestly even if Hisenberg did not want use Ethan's daughter. The fact that he still super evil and doing all of these evil experiments. Would make Ethan not want to team up with him.
[4:36:33] <PlumpPotatoRump> the way he says "Bitch" is so fucking great
[4:36:34] <$bognugget> fucking nerd

[4:37:46] <%Maids4lyfe> Mother Miranda probably the mummy
[4:37:47] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls
[4:37:50] <%MonsterEnvy> @HitchhikingThrough Not really. This guy is doing human experiments, which Stein was not.
[4:37:59] <%jtdobyns> I miss the orignial RE cast of characters. :(
[4:38:00] <deviljhojho_> besides you cant throw a stone without hitting a bioterrorist in the RE worrld ya know!
[4:38:04] <calmsoul689> did it just start?
[4:38:07] <@SoFarFetched> nope
[4:38:10] <%MonsterEnvy> @MonsterEnvy He married her before he knew about that.
[4:38:13] <@SoFarFetched> he's been at this for hours
[4:38:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @monsterenvy i mean he was experimenting with dead bodies
[4:38:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> @MonsterEnvy sounds like Oscar was already dead tho
[4:38:15] <@SoFarFetched> !uptime
[4:38:15] <@Moobot> @SoFarFetched I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 38m.
[4:38:18] <$floralkami> @monsterenvy no, he said it was a body of someone already dead.
[4:38:19] <deviljhojho_> been going for like 5 hours
[4:38:22] <Samurai_Tchan> unbrella is always trying these type of bullshit to destroy the world and they lose a lot of money
[4:38:24] <rudiciuscaesar> Oh, I sent my ex-wife the clip of Ethan running from The Baby, and she has a 2 year old now and she's like "yeah, that's how I feel when she wakes up..."
[4:38:26] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Realized I’ve just been lurking, but shoutout Pat for being my background noise while I grind Outriders
[4:38:30] <calmsoul689> sweet thanks moobot
[4:38:41] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[4:38:46] <@SoFarFetched> so if you're tuning in now,you missed a lot of stuff. Since this is also the 2nd stream and Pat's almost done with the game.
[4:38:52] <Albedo28> umbrella is using war as a business to end war as a business
[4:38:53] <deviljhojho_> umbrela is like epic losing money on banal bullshit and going "oh hell yeah its all coming together"
[4:38:55] <+MisterAvry> why is this music so good
[4:38:58] <rudiciuscaesar> then she saw baby flask and was like "should I keep watching this?"
[4:39:01] <$floralkami> Oscar was a farmhand who fell from some balcony
[4:39:04] <deviljhojho_> Epic probably has no bioterror department tho
[4:39:08] <dinnydanny777> I'm really curious about how Miranda is gonna be doing more messed up stuff than this factory
[4:39:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @deviljhojho_ that we know of
[4:39:41] <%HitchhikingThrough> Level with me chat, are we finishing this tonight?
[4:39:45] <deviljhojho_> @SuckerPunchSyd hmmm true
[4:39:56] <Samurai_Tchan> resident evil story has to end
[4:39:56] <@SoFarFetched> if he does 8 hours like yesterday,possibly
[4:39:58] <Jaysky> Depends how much Pat wants to play
[4:40:10] <+Punchasaur> Fortnite kids are a bioterror
[4:40:11] <deviljhojho_> it should only be one more level no?
[4:40:11] <aoiyume> I just beat it so now I can watch the angry Canadian play it
[4:40:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah I agree with Sofar
[4:40:15] <slimslimjim88> Technically tmrw morning
[4:40:19] <Jaysky> He could finish tonight, but he may want his schedule to be more spread out with RE
[4:40:20] <+pradashoe> is he just on a pee break
[4:40:24] <Albedo28> I hope he does eight hours. My sleep schedule is all over the place and I'm feeling way too awake
[4:40:29] <$floralkami> @rudiciuscaesar lytWHAT hold up, your ex-wife??
[4:40:48] <user_naim> @albedo28 06:47 over here lol
[4:40:49] <+pradashoe> is the stream over?
[4:40:51] <Jaysky> I got my first covid shot and I feel like absolute shit so watching the stream is helping a bit
[4:41:01] <Albedo28> @user_naim noice
[4:41:02] <@SoFarFetched> no he's taking a break
[4:41:03] <Jaysky> No, he's on break
[4:41:04] <notsoy> no, it's a break to deal with the babies
[4:41:04] <KeiPrime> if he goes for another couple of hours its very do-able
[4:41:06] <+MisterAvry> @pradashoe dog pee time
[4:41:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> INB4 he fell asleep
[4:41:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Dog pee break i thought
[4:41:18] <%juxtest> @pradashoe Dog needs to be emptied
[4:41:19] <MrRavine> Based on how much progress he made yesterday he might as well finish, otherwise day 3 will be super short
[4:41:20] <%HitchhikingThrough> Wouldn't blame him tbh
[4:41:21] <doc_ock_rokc> @Jaysky maderna or phizer

[4:45:31] <Jaysky> @floralkami ironmouseSippy
[4:45:31] <rudiciuscaesar> Yeah, practice with puppy teeth not adult doggo teeth
[4:45:35] <Albedo28> Ethan certainly can't tell you how to keep fingers

[4:45:53] <%DashXero> Yeah. It does.
[4:45:58] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, we're still teaching our 1 year old German shepherd to bite less
[4:45:58] <deviljhojho_> i just get breeds with wimpy teeth
[4:45:58] <+TensecondTarvis> tell mine to be gentle, works 90% of the time

[4:46:11] <rudiciuscaesar> I love her
[4:46:12] <%JoshManVGH> Ethan was bit by an untrained puppers.
[4:46:15] <Albedo28> @Meltgar I read that as puppy shark teeth
[4:46:15] <+MisterAvry> they bite your ears and shit
[4:46:22] <+Punchasaur> They have little needle teeth
[4:46:27] <%maenos2> does pat know he hasn't switched back to the game yet

[4:46:39] <rudiciuscaesar> the island is the worst part of RE4
[4:46:43] <%condemned_15> LUL
[4:46:43] <user_naim> Shhh
[4:46:43] <%Ranryu692> shut up don't tell him
[4:46:44] <%blutzwavedave> But no oven man tho
[4:46:45] <%MonsterEnvy> Did RE 4 have a section like the Factory?
[4:46:46] <%Frost_Quill> lol
[4:46:47] <+superkeaton> probably has to do with the lack of fucking machineguns the enemy has
[4:46:48] <$Faustgesicht> Is just me or is this re easier?
[4:46:49] <user_naim> Nobody say shit
[4:46:51] <%OswaldTheDog> oh man puppy bites are HURTY
[4:46:51] <rudiciuscaesar> I hate it, I hate it so much, it feels so flat compared to Salazar Land
[4:46:54] <dinnydanny777> limesGiggle
[4:46:58] <vonmaultke> Depends on the dog, some don’t bite hard from the start
[4:46:59] <$floralkami> @jaysky lytBLUSH
[4:47:00] <balthazar758> militarized ganados
[4:47:00] <InvincibleIcarus> big agree
[4:47:02] <+Buzzkill983> Agree
[4:47:02] <Albedo28> who needs gameplay when we can stare at pat telling us about how he gets bit by puppers?
[4:47:04] <Jaysky> I like the enemy variety. The glowing chests seem fun to hit
[4:47:05] <%dekkitout> Is there not a timer below saying how long he's been live?
[4:47:09] <Noogiez> yo
[4:47:19] <Albedo28> !uptime
[4:47:20] <NicholasKane> !uptime
[4:47:20] <@Moobot> @Albedo28 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 47m.
[4:47:21] <MusouMiko> the re5... ...was terrible
[4:47:22] <bestwaifuritsu> inb4 a giant JJ cyborg with gatling guns for arms
[4:47:23] <$floralkami> Ironmouse ❤️
[4:47:24] <Albedo28> or something XD
[4:47:25] <%condemned_15> the island sucks but I thought the regenerator parts were interesting
[4:47:25] <doc_ock_rokc> @OswaldTheDog all you have to do is say OW! and act hurt and most dogs I know eventually stop
[4:47:27] <jtsoppy137> i dont like much about RE 5
[4:47:29] <rudiciuscaesar> but the RE7 lab was unbelievably clean and had Lucas....
[4:47:34] <KeiPrime> re5 lab also had those instakill cockroach guys
[4:47:35] <%MajorCrasher> fuck those bug things in re5
[4:47:37] <%MonsterEnvy> We have not made it to the Lab here there was another area called the Lab
[4:47:38] <xxshadowxx416> what about re makes labs
[4:47:39] <dan_g_v> didn't you like giant bat?
[4:47:40] <@SoFarFetched> @dekkitout under his screen theres a timer next to viewers along with the commander !uptime
[4:47:42] <SaphronBlackbourne> Guess they could improve the island in the remake? I'm fine with a 4 remake tbh
[4:47:44] <dinnydanny777> I can see the doll house getting old on repeat playthroughs
[4:47:48] <Jaysky> @floralkami ironmouseCHANCLA
[4:47:48] <%Frost_Quill> I still find it funny that up until the factory you were just drowning in cash and resources, but now everything is too expensive and you're broke.
[4:47:51] <doc_ock_rokc> Yeah
[4:47:52] <%MajorCrasher> their instakill horseshit was annoying
[4:47:52] <NireFuster> what the fuck am I looking at
[4:47:53] <%Dehlome> its sick
[4:47:53] <Albedo28> that looks like Saruman's orc factory
[4:47:53] <+Buzzkill983> So many bodies D:
[4:47:54] <%jorniev> THATS FROM ONE OF THE MOVIES
[4:47:55] <KeiPrime> giant bat catapillar was cool

[4:47:58] <balthazar758> @condemned_15 oh, the regenerator is fantastic
[4:48:04] <%MonsterEnvy> I think Hisenberg has murdered or dug up hundreds of people.
[4:48:06] <%condemned_15> thats an album cover
[4:48:07] <+DBTenno> Would be hilarious if RE8 had a cameo system and you cameo'd in other streams
[4:48:07] <Khorneflakes_> Fortunately the Doll House is a short level
[4:48:12] <%X2Eliah> oki
[4:48:13] <bestwaifuritsu> Woo!
[4:48:14] <Mattais88> How many people were in this small village for Hisenburg to have that many bodies?
[4:48:14] <%punks55> half life 2 vibes in here
[4:48:23] <rudiciuscaesar> is new Nier just fetish fuel like Automata, cuz that is worrisome.
[4:48:23] <Jaysky> Regenerator was a great enemy

[4:57:03] <%Frost_Quill> @KamenOtaku Magneto man wants to kill his mom, so logically he did all this.
[4:57:04] <$floralkami> DIAGO PARRY THE DRILL, ETHAN
[4:57:04] <notsoy> flashbang + pipebomb combo
[4:57:07] <+KilogramHours> Is this RE or Bioshock Infinite?

[4:57:43] <+DBTenno> If this weren't Resident Evil, I'd say that the Jetpack Zombies goes beyond jumping the shark.
[4:57:43] <%Ranryu692> I'm glad the trailers spent so much time making us think Lady D was going to be like the main threat
[4:57:45] <KeiPrime> landmines work well

[4:59:18] <jumpyhugs> stair frames kinda worked for the overhead
[4:59:22] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt It's like the Cargoship/Wesker's Lair in RE5

[4:59:41] <+PenmanLupine> yeah, fuckers in Fulgore power armor is a little nutty
[4:59:41] <rudiciuscaesar> I don't think this is that far off now, but yeah, the escalation
[4:59:42] <%HitchhikingThrough> This is Doom 3 but good.
[4:59:42] <+Vigonept> ETHAN VS JETSTREAM SAM
[4:59:43] <T_Sasquatch> Oh you're in for some bullshit
[4:59:43] <+ALazo> Propeller man... but it flies with the propeller
[4:59:43] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> village is just the demo for RE4 Remake
[4:59:43] <balthazar758> zombie aliens
[4:59:44] <neodeluxe_> I mean, we have had leech men
[4:59:44] <lloyddboy> WESKER SHOULDA HAD A JETPACK
[4:59:46] <%walternatorz> then hulk
[4:59:46] <%garbageheaphound> ETHAN FIGHTING HEISENBERG ON TOP OF A METAL GEAT
[4:59:46] <munitalprats> things derailed when a motherfucker used MAGNET POWERS PAT
[4:59:46] <%RetroCop87> I mean, compare this to the bio-whatevers in RE6
[4:59:48] <vilecrois> mecha biogodzilla soon
[4:59:48] <Chibean> It's becoming Rise of Nightmares
[4:59:48] <%garbageheaphound> GEAR
[4:59:48] <+InhumanMilitia> 11 hours right?
[4:59:49] <munitalprats> IT BECAME METAL GEAR
[4:59:52] <%VoidBaronJules> you mean tetsuo meets evil within * the ramp up
[4:59:55] <oda_flobunaga> This is some Wolfenstein shit
[4:59:57] <Parapattern> You're gonna fight motor head in a mecha suit
[5:00:00] <balthazar758> ethan gets a katana
[5:00:00] <sougoe> We gonna be playig Wolfenstein by the end of the game
[5:00:01] <+Buzzkill983> RIP AND MOLD ETHAN
[5:00:02] <%athuramn> I love this classic resident evil monster
[5:00:10] <%baronouroboros> I mean, Chris punching boulders.
[5:00:10] <%dekkitout> Does RE have nanomachines?
[5:00:10] <KeiPrime> its not re6, fighting the giant bone tiger, who turned into a t-rex who turned into a giant fly that was really a guy who REALLY wanted to bone ada wong but, its something
[5:00:12] <$Ziegsy> how else do you do frankenstiens monster when youve done zombies?
[5:00:13] <+Punchasaur> If it keeps going we’ll see aliens
[5:00:15] <rudiciuscaesar> wtf?
[5:00:15] <dinnydanny777> Heisenberg seems to be saying Miranda is even stronger than this, so whatever the fuck she's doing or is is gotta be something insane
[5:00:16] <$SGrim> @lloyddboy Why bother. He can teleport.
[5:00:17] <librettodude> To be fair, this is just the Rust/Lowtech equivalent of an endgame RE lab
[5:00:18] <%HitchhikingThrough> what was that thing even cooling
[5:00:18] <Balay123> ETHAN AND HEISENBERG FIGHTING SHIRTLESS IN THE RAIN
[5:00:19] <doc_ock_rokc> Its still transhumanism its just less bio mechanical and more human agumentation @PatStaresAt
[5:00:19] <%juxtest> There is no way cybernetic zombies are a better investment than cybernetic humans. Heisenberg is making his own product obsolete with every step he takes
[5:00:23] <cardamomo88> is si weird
[5:00:27] <+Vigonept> mold is nano machines
[5:00:32] <+impressionistcowboy> how do the guns feel in all this combat? I know that RPS and eurogamer found the gunplay to be a bit klunky when the action started ramping up
[5:00:32] <%Monkeyweed21> but it is yummu
[5:00:32] <%ospreyworks> Seems about as plausible as Wesker's massive, multistory human farm with a giant rotating elevator, deep underground in an African country.
[5:00:36] <%bottom_feeder88> Next game they are chopping off Ethans head and putting it back on
[5:00:37] <oda_flobunaga> Lady D played College Ball ya know
[5:00:40] <+KilogramHours> imma gonna say the fan turns back on
[5:00:43] <GrayBrook> THIS NOT SAFE PLACE TO BE
[5:00:44] <dinnydanny777> That looks like an arena
[5:00:45] <%baronouroboros> nanomachines, Ethan.
[5:00:47] <%transporterthesequel> BIOMACHINES SON
[5:00:51] <+fetrigon> how many hands has Ethan lost so far?
[5:00:51] <T_Sasquatch> Like i said earlier, this game could be titled anything and you wouldn't know its resident evil LUL
[5:00:52] <munitalprats> "why is he named heisenberg? is he a meth dealer?" "no, he's bisexual"
[5:00:53] <+KilogramHours> OSHA IS NOT HAPPY
[5:00:55] <lloyddboy> @lloyddboy if he could fly he wouldn't have died in lava like a bitch
[5:00:56] <%IAMEVILORD> IAMEVILORD subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:00:58] <balthazar758> Liquid Ethan shows up
[5:01:04] <librettodude> Grinder Shaft? But I hardly know her!

[5:06:50] <%Shadowevilkoala> 3 stage boss battle?
[5:06:50] <$SGrim> Or all three
[5:06:50] <+Ran196> its all three
[5:06:51] <%marsantas> 3 stage fight?
[5:06:51] <oda_flobunaga> that long narrow hallway at the end?
[5:06:51] <+TheHotStuven> All 3
[5:06:51] <%Jaxnos> i'm gonna say maze, for the spice
[5:06:51] <%walternatorz> that's right, the square one
[5:06:52] <%LouieRouie> The Hallway?
[5:06:53] <+ALazo> why not all
[5:06:53] <%bottom_feeder88> Pursuit phase, puzzle phase and kill phase
[5:06:53] <%X2Eliah> WHY NOT ALL
[5:06:53] <%HitchhikingThrough> Probably all 3
[5:06:56] <slimslimjim88> He hasn’t been outside for a week and still thinks there’s a village FailFish
[5:06:56] <+Ran196> three bosses in a row
[5:06:56] <noyman2000> Could be everything
[5:06:56] <%trekkie11041> EMLO
[5:06:56] <%coreyyotto> Why not three boss fights!
[5:06:57] <user_naim> both?
[5:06:57] <Sigma_190_Beta> The little rooms.
[5:06:59] <+KilogramHours> WHO PAYS FOR THIS?
[5:06:59] <NeroInfinite> is it aboth
[5:06:59] <%X2Eliah> three bosses
[5:07:01] <%miguelrod777> the maze lead up to the boss battle obviously
[5:07:04] <balthazar758> clearly it's that tiny room on the left
[5:07:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Maze is propeller, the large one is Heinsenberg
[5:07:07] <$realm_forge> Is it the narrow hall after the cargo bay?
[5:07:10] <%jorniev> OH GOD
[5:07:13] <%baronouroboros> Bio Gear Metal
[5:07:15] <%trustycoyote> Potempkin's travel pods?!
[5:07:15] <+TheBitingIrish> Zippity
[5:07:16] <CrazyMedicine> Even Ethan is tired of this nonsense
[5:07:17] <%bottom_feeder88> Skyrim door maybe?
[5:07:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what were they even making here
[5:07:18] <socratetris> tiny rooms are always Boss rooms
[5:07:20] <%jorniev> METAL GEAR!?
[5:07:22] <%X2Eliah> jetpack
[5:07:23] <Gorgs7> Ethan... you have a map
[5:07:26] <vinceshamwowslap> resident evil always has industrial levels LUL
[5:07:26] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Shoot Yellow
[5:07:26] <%marsantas> Zipline
[5:07:27] <%sporeian94> shoot the yellow pillar!
[5:07:27] <KingSpunf> "If Mother Miranda gets her way, she will destroy all of Dry Creek, Alaska!"
[5:07:28] <+ZaralinGaming> I feel like the fish dude got like no screen time compared to Lady D and Magneto
[5:07:30] <42nfl19> zipline?
[5:07:31] <$floralkami> TEN HOURS
[5:07:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> Shoot the pillar?
[5:07:40] <noyman2000> Just popped in. This looks like the cave in RE7
[5:07:41] <%bottom_feeder88> yeah good call on the Metal Gear Rex shirt going into this fight.
[5:07:41] <eiyuusyndrome> you have to rescue huey emmerich
[5:07:42] <%jorniev> HOOOOOW
[5:07:43] <dinnydanny777> This really is Saruman's caves
[5:07:45] <+Vigonept> middle children, no one cares
[5:07:46] <42nfl19> I think there is a zipline on the map
[5:07:48] <%HitchhikingThrough> BTW the industrial output of this factory puts most third world countries to shame
[5:07:50] <cardamomo88> pff
[5:07:51] <user_naim> It’s going to be a Metal Gear Rex for sure
[5:07:53] <%baronouroboros> That factory is ridiculously massive.
[5:07:55] <MyNameIsRasus> 10 HOUR GAME TOTALLY *clown noises*
[5:07:56] <%HitchhikingThrough> Just feel like I should point it out
[5:08:00] <+TheBitingIrish> PAT
[5:08:01] <Khorneflakes_> @ZaralinGaming And ghost puppet lady
[5:08:05] <Hellarussian> is jar baby an Omega-level mutant?
[5:08:05] <luciluxlu0> at least you remember fishdude, what about the doll
[5:08:11] <boogaleeboo> he didn't, the dolls are a cool horror set, the first and last bosses have massive areas, and fish guy is sort of padding
[5:08:12] <+TheBitingIrish> You can drop down opposite the door
[5:08:18] <%trustycoyote> Who said this was a 10 hour game?
[5:08:27] <+TheBitingIrish> doodGood
[5:08:29] <Link232> Do steel plants usually have this level of cavern underneath them or is it the biovirus that carved it
[5:08:32] <cardamomo88> i want rose body to combine like mecha
[5:08:32] <dinnydanny777> how did he make a jetpack
[5:08:33] <%TheLakinessMonster> Is Hesienburg just a Cult of Mechanicus priest? This is a servitor factory.
[5:08:38] <+fetrigon> @hitchhikingthrough I'm
[5:08:46] <%TheLakinessMonster> It's sick to see.
[5:08:53] <+fetrigon> dumb can you spell it out
[5:08:55] <%IAMEVILORD> @crazymedicine Dude, Ethan's default state since RE8 started has been tired of this shit' and pissed. And it's only gotten worse from their. The only person hes remotely polite toward right now is the Duke.
[5:08:56] <%HitchhikingThrough> @fetrigon You're
[5:08:58] <Gorgs7> I love how there's only 1 save point in this entire area
[5:08:58] <KieftainGc> with his hurt hand!?
[5:09:00] <deviljhojho_> there's only death
[5:09:01] <luciluxlu0> I wanna see the re8 speed run so bad.
[5:09:01] <%iShouldBeAtWorklol> @link232 yes I am a steel plant owner
[5:09:03] <dinnydanny777> would be cool if Rose and Ethan fuse together and do a Sailor Moon intro
[5:09:11] <$floralkami> does anyone know who said that the game would only be 10hrs long?
[5:09:12] <42nfl19> a single shiney rock
[5:09:17] <%jyeowa> ethan's gotta be pretty used to being a velociraptor on one hand at this point
[5:09:17] <deviljhojho_> to show he is badass
[5:09:18] <+DoctorDerp388> cuz he's a G
[5:09:19] <vilecrois> Cuz his other hand pops off all the time
[5:09:21] <+Vigonept> shoot on zipwire
[5:09:22] <%dekkitout> Because he enjoys suffering?
[5:09:29] <%jorniev> WOW spherehunter was right i miss the castle
[5:09:31] <+TheHotStuven> Amalthus here to buy our shit
[5:09:33] <sothatsprettybrutal> he pays a lot of money for quartz of all things
[5:09:33] <SpawnConnery> Is he left hand dominant? He seems to use it a lot despite the injury
[5:09:35] <+impressionistcowboy> DO IT

[5:10:24] <%IAMEVILORD> Ethan has a tendicy to tunnel vision in both games.
[5:10:24] <$floralkami> @fathergreybeard no, tho this is one of the few times you see him that close

[5:11:12] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, dude's aim is bad lol
[5:11:12] <%ejackalope> at least the dark brings back some  more of the horror element

[5:11:36] <+TensecondTarvis> why mad?
[5:11:36] <mesamus> he missed the combo
[5:11:37] <%CalderGaming> why he heff to be mad
[5:11:37] <%HitchhikingThrough> @fetrigon Uhh basically most videogames get the scale of industry very wrong, and the sheer amount of equipment in this factory + all the drills on the drill dudes is kind of nuts for a single building to be producing.
[5:11:39] <KieftainGc> look like he got stiff armed in blitz
[5:11:42] <+Buzzkill983> He was vibing and then you showed up
[5:11:43] <khailward> Is only game, we he haf to be mad?
[5:11:47] <$floralkami> imagine if this guy came at you doing all his katas and shit, only to be nullified by Motorhead busting through the wall?
[5:11:48] <sougoe> He spent all day labbing only to whiff his combo

[5:12:06] <%jorniev> man these doors are so weird
[5:12:06] <%HitchhikingThrough> @fetrigon especially when you consider how many of those things were being pumped out every second on that construction line
[5:12:06] <%RetroCop87> can you shoot them in the reactor while they're staggered?

[5:12:51] <LunarRemix> Ethan's a fucking monster man
[5:12:52] <tanarath> FOR A WHILE
[5:12:52] <%X2Eliah> The two steam jets are totally strong enough to cool the metal

[5:12:53] <+kawachipto> door
[5:12:53] <wasdsf> ethan is flat out invincible at this point
[5:12:54] <no123450n> ethan likes hand abuse, it's fine

[5:21:59] <+KilogramHours> @rudiciuscaesar Duke
[5:22:03] <dbag202> You can hear monsters groaning
[5:22:04] <HeroToxiko> was that a monster sound?
[5:22:09] <%ringabal> There were multiple
[5:22:11] <+TheHotStuven> Yup
[5:22:11] <+KilogramHours> Duke is having fat problems
[5:22:12] <+derpumpkinking> SHADOWWWW PUZZZLESSSSSSS
[5:22:13] <missingangle> Don't remind me of that one. Oh the agony
[5:22:15] <KeiPrime> theres a few shrines like this
[5:22:15] <GrayBrook> Twilight princess had one too
[5:22:15] <dbag202> WHY
[5:22:15] <%watchmanfury> it was by far the worst shrine in the game
[5:22:15] <Mattais88> No, you just flipped the board over
[5:22:15] <cardamomo88> fuck zelda puzzels
[5:22:18] <%maenos2> man fuck the shrines using motion controls
[5:22:18] <Mister_McDerp> I hated that puzzle
[5:22:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> no cheating
[5:22:18] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah except it was a giant maze that you controlled
[5:22:19] <%RetroCop87> and all you had to do was flip the stage upside down to solve it
[5:22:19] <%condemned_15> the fishing house in Twilight Princess
[5:22:19] <%Jaxnos> i wanna believe one person worked on these ball puzzles specifically and had a blast during all of development
[5:22:19] <Saltmeisterr> that shrine was fucked
[5:22:20] <%maenos2> i gave up on those things
[5:22:20] <pzambarda> you fool
[5:22:21] <dinnydanny777> The trick is to turn the puzzle upside down and do it flat
[5:22:21] <rudiciuscaesar> lol @KilogramHours wtf is the Duke doing?
[5:22:21] <jubejube56> In the Zelda puzzle you could literally flip the puzzle upside down and just roll it in that way
[5:22:24] <KieftainGc> Get Over It 2
[5:22:24] <notsoy> that whole shrine sub-type was fucking dumb
[5:22:26] <%Shadowevilkoala> so you could cheese the botw shrines by turning them upside down and just launching the ball
[5:22:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> There's multiples of that shrine type.
[5:22:30] <+OrangeMDT> I wish this was a timed demo just so it would end on this puzzle
[5:22:30] <balthazar758> "it's time to pet the baby"
[5:22:31] <+Chronobot> The monsters are waiting patiently to kill you after you solve it
[5:22:31] <$RealThiele> jesus this angle
[5:22:32] <%livlinn> it was terrible woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:22:37] <+KilogramHours> @rudiciuscaesar obesity
[5:22:38] <+zoopbooploop> The shrine puzzle was fine since you could flip the controller upside down so it's just a flat board to roll on
[5:22:38] <marrowjuice> if it's the one i'm thinking of, that would be the one where i just said fuck it and kept flipping it upside down until it worked
[5:22:38] <%vergiIsparda> dont mind me i am sub and running because i dont want spoilers (i didnt get a chance to catch the stream up to this point), love u pat have fun playing RE8!! hope its going well so far 🙏
[5:22:39] <%amused_platypus> gotta do the resident evil spin
[5:22:40] <notsoy> you were better off just flipping the ball way into the air and aiming for the hole lol
[5:22:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @TurtlesAndTentacles I'm playing it right now as he's playing lol
[5:22:41] <majindusto> PAT  JUST KEEPS FUCKING  UP enigmaKEK
[5:22:41] <%HitchhikingThrough> monkaS
[5:22:44] <randomahole> just flip your wiiu tablet upside down, Pat
[5:22:46] <Gorgs7> The worst part about this is that the perspective always sucks
[5:22:50] <PraiseHemra> This is the real game
[5:22:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Thanks chat, Raymond Scott - Powerhouse significantly improved this
[5:22:54] <vVAstrAVv> no it wasnt cus in that shrine you could just turn the puzzle upside down lol
[5:22:55] <%blutzwavedave> Why doesn't Ethan just puit the ball in the hole himself?
[5:22:59] <%athuramn> so now they care about realistic physics but when ethans being pulled by a fan he can just dead space it
[5:23:02] <+fetrigon> monkaS monkaS
[5:23:02] <Lolaylaou> at least you don't need tou use motion controls for this one

[5:33:54] <%MonsterEnvy> Maybe put out a mine?
[5:33:55] <%pureinfection> wait till no more fire
[5:33:55] <%ringabal> HERE COMES MONGO
[5:33:58] <Jaysky> @Celarious Both would hurt. Standing in the steam would give him third degree burns with how often he's walking through them
[5:34:00] <%legendscar01> that wasn't scary
[5:34:01] <KingKZ> The toot is what makes it perfect.
[5:34:06] <bestwaifuritsu> is he making fucking flintstones work bell noises when he shoots fire
[5:34:08] <PraiseHemra> use mines
[5:34:08] <samazam94> lol he has a monster hunter rage mode

[5:34:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I was hella confused for a hot minute cause people were just screaming my name.... I just figured out they are talking about Arkham Asylum
[5:34:26] <munitalprats> these propellers would have busted off a WHILE ago
[5:34:28] <ZE_Count> My propeller son is so tough!
[5:34:28] <themountaindwarf> Megaman bosses sure have gotten weirder in newer installments
[5:34:29] <Khorneflakes_> @Nox_Ludicro cohhStare
[5:34:30] <%Mendin> He's all fired up, he's really feeling it
[5:34:30] <noyman2000> You're basically fighting a garrador
[5:34:33] <Jaysky> Train conductor choo chooooooo
[5:34:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> TOOT TOOOOOOT
[5:34:35] <KingSpunf> Heisenberg: "Nooo! You can't justchop your own arms off and overheat! You're a complete failure!" Propeller Man: "Haha, propeller go brrr :)"
[5:34:41] <Gorgs7> This fight really reminds me of that Thomas the Tank engine mod for skyrim
[5:34:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @R3Roundabout shhhh dont tell him lol
[5:34:47] <%IAMEVILORD> @kalyxchews  Ethan lives in the constant state of needing a god damn cup coffee. Cause hes tired of this shit
[5:34:48] <+xtkxyz> man RE8 is weird
[5:34:49] <boogaleeboo> I really hope pat doesn't have to stack damage in the flame phase to kill him
[5:34:55] <Khorneflakes_> @no123450n to be fair... naruto running woulda saved his arms FeelsBadMan
[5:34:56] <+kalyxchews> even his weakpoint has one thousand health
[5:34:57] <+KilogramHours> How much health does this fucker have
[5:34:58] <%logoth_> holy shit this thing takes a lot of hits
[5:34:58] <KieftainGc> lol omg fall over man
[5:34:59] <MyNameIsRasus> this is a pretty cool bane
[5:34:59] <%Piemono> So do we have to kill him in his fire mode?
[5:35:01] <TheSphereHunter> this is lame AF thesph1MistyJoy
[5:35:01] <+impressionistcowboy> i tihink you need to kill him while on fire
[5:35:02] <MusouMiko> @boogaleeboo :)
[5:35:07] <%MonsterEnvy> I think you have to damage him in the fire phase
[5:35:09] <%jyeowa> you'd think this guy of any monster would be worth some magnum shots
[5:35:09] <seniormeatbox> I like how its a choo choo train when he flames up
[5:35:09] <squeakyclarinet> He totally does
[5:35:10] <%eyezehuhh> BANE FIGHT
[5:35:11] <majindusto> This Isn't  your everyday regular  Bane...THIS IS ADVANCED  BANE!!!
[5:35:13] <MidnightPacif1c> fancy 2003 boss

[5:35:18] <%jorniev> THIS IS SO DUMB
[5:35:18] <doc_ock_rokc> he mad
[5:35:21] <%GarbageNirvana> It does seem like we're caught in a loop here
[5:35:25] <sougoe> Who's a bigger bullet sponge? Ethan or Prophead?
[5:35:26] <+Felremi> shoot him when his engine's on fire
[5:35:26] <rudiciuscaesar> this is kinda lame, too much damage sponge
[5:35:27] <KingKZ> The toot is killing me every time. It's genius.
[5:35:27] <+InhumanMilitia> he gets stuck on 3rd bounce
[5:35:31] <willsin4fun> the leaf shield kills airman in like 2 hits; this guy tho, he tough
[5:35:32] <%legendscar01> you have to shoot him in the fire phase looks like
[5:35:32] <+impressionistcowboy> like if you don't shoot enough during flame  it will just never progress
[5:35:33] <auraofdawn> i like our dumb silly propeller guy
[5:35:33] <rudiciuscaesar> need third gimmick
[5:35:37] <+jimmyjams1688> shoot him in the front when it's glowing! it's the one RE rule
[5:35:37] <Mister_McDerp> this boss fight is overstaying its welcome
[5:35:44] <squeakyclarinet> Pat's just messing it up I think.
[5:35:48] <doc_ock_rokc> @sougoe Ethan by a mile
[5:35:48] <%eyezehuhh> Become as Bane Become as Bane
[5:35:49] <KieftainGc> This is the part where you fall down
[5:35:49] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Maybe Mines I think you have to kill him in fire phase
[5:35:52] <+Felremi> shoot now lol
[5:35:53] <+Mrbaconator> ok ye this fight sucks
[5:35:54] <wasdsf> he gettin slow its gotta end soon
[5:35:54] <+KilogramHours> @PatStaresAt I think you have to shoot him while he's on fire to get to the next stage
[5:35:56] <Parapattern> I thought he was gonna chase you down some hallways or something
[5:35:57] <jumpyhugs> Shoot the prop when it's glowy?
[5:35:57] <seniormeatbox> No pat just isn't being nearly as aggresive as the game wants him to be
[5:35:57] <a_mad_dragon_> nice music cue there
[5:36:00] <+kalyxchews> is this the normal difficulty? i joined late
[5:36:01] <%jorniev> THIS whole area is too ling

[6:53:12] <pipboy344> @sofarfetched Can I has?
[6:53:12] <%AnIcedCoffee> Factory is way better than the mines from RE7 though
[6:53:13] <%Blackleafx> "i must kill the mold" no ethan, you are the mold, and then ethan was mold
[6:53:14] <+NoriBasket> it was cool

[6:53:15] <$RealThiele> bat juice
[6:53:17] <frostiecrow> where it is in ypur RE top tier
[6:53:17] <MrRavine> The more Resident Evil a Resident Evil game is, the less I like it LUL That's why RE4 is my favorite. Basically no story
[6:53:17] <+kojibeoulve> better final area than usual final areas for re games
[6:53:18] <TheSphereHunter> yea it is
[6:53:18] <pi_in_the_sci> so is the ship\

[6:53:21] <%bettysharkface> psaDab
[6:53:22] <Yakobro> @PatStaresAt what does the death of ethan mean for the future of the redfield bloodline?
[6:53:22] <rangriz> RE8>RE7
[6:53:23] <%RetroCop87> salt mine is super short tho
[6:53:23] <+kalyxchews> this was the mold mine but good

[6:53:26] <%Frost_Quill> Hope Duke made it out, but he seemed to be magic.  Or a figment of Ethan's imagination?
[6:53:27] <Chatterbox1991> ethan*
[6:53:27] <sothatsprettybrutal> this animation is super good damn
[6:53:27] <perpetualpotionmachine> I cant believe we got so attached to that faceless chump

[6:53:29] <SpellCatty> Is this the Deathly Hallows
[6:53:29] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Makes sense why Mia read this story at the start.
[6:53:29] <balthazar758> then three days later he came back
[6:53:30] <42nfl19> BUT WHO WAS THE DUKE?
[6:53:31] <TDAWS_MP132> The Duke is a cryptid, he's fine LUL
[6:53:31] <Khorneflakes_> Oh yeah... this is better than RE7 but I don't think the margin is too big
[6:53:33] <deviljhojho_> i cant believe we were playing as a molded one for two games
[6:53:34] <TheSphereHunter> at least they made the shoot part over powered Chris
[6:53:34] <+CyprienCole> still waiting for a good resident evil game
[6:53:34] <+LazyBumNetwork> Man, Ethan has bad taste in women lmao
[6:53:34] <+tetraes> was it better than re6?

[6:53:39] <squeakyclarinet> look at this sick video!
[6:53:40] <MrRavine> Yeah Factory is cool but wayyyyy too long
[6:53:41] <+FlappySeal_> The part with the hallucinations and creepy baby etc was easily the highlight, should have lasted longer for sure
[6:53:41] <+KilogramHours> WATER SPOOKY
[6:53:42] <reasonance> I missed some stuff, what's so special about Rose?
[6:53:42] <42nfl19> WAS DUKE THE REAPER?
[6:53:43] <Onamar> Easy excuse for why you can't just fuck off
[6:53:44] <rudiciuscaesar> Pat, you ever been on a boat, they're terrifying!
[6:53:44] <noyman2000> MUCH BETTER THAN RE7
[6:53:45] <%IAMEVILORD> I love how Ethan finally got respect. RE8 rules!
[6:53:45] <+NoriBasket> you can't run away from a boat
[6:53:45] <seniormeatbox> Only 4 pat
[6:53:47] <+kalyxchews> boats are scary pat, you played monstrum
[6:53:49] <Tracazoid> RE7, Rev 1, Gaiden, the sub in RE6
[6:53:49] <iosephe> no one expects boat zombies
[6:53:49] <+krispen_wa> They're Berserk references
[6:53:49] <+jimmyjams1688> CAn't escape boat
[6:53:49] <%coreyyotto> Because of the implication
[6:53:50] <Gorgs7> They love the fish boss
[6:53:51] <digaogrunge> Also no VR gimmick
[6:53:52] <pi_in_the_sci> it gives you a good, can't escape feel
[6:53:52] <Meltgar> Whos this on the credits? Miranda?
[6:53:52] <ginguilt> TOO SHORT?
[6:53:52] <amritadyne> because they're large, enclosed spaces
[6:53:52] <$floralkami> wait, was there a boat level in this?
[6:53:53] <%TheMattman1313> You mean all of Revelations 1 then?>
[6:53:54] <%Axellogic> Need more deadspace boats
[6:53:55] <%hq_residential_house> yeah the boat goes on wayyyy tooo long when it needed to just be a vignette
[6:53:55] <KingKZ> This makes RE7 look like RE6.
[6:53:55] <%Maids4lyfe> water is scary
[6:53:55] <NicholasKane> enclosed complicated small easily-mapped space
[6:53:56] <+Ghufufin> boat easy isolation
[6:53:56] <sothatsprettybrutal> it's because of the Terragrigia Incident
[6:53:57] <+Ran196> the RE team loves boat
[6:53:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> WTF is this
[6:53:58] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt Off the cuff, where would you put this in your ranking?
[6:53:59] <%KamenOtaku> Tight spaces, easy to isolate from other places?
[6:54:00] <%MajorCrasher> I liked the boat level
[6:54:01] <Th3rd3> Queen Zenobia TPFufun
[6:54:01] <Scamsy> resident evil revelations 1 is a bad boat level
[6:54:01] <Josef_Stryker> It's that series' Millennium Tower?
[6:54:02] <+gespenst25> What is the Tim Burton shit?
[6:54:02] <%juxtest> Boats are isolated, you cant leave a boat
[6:54:03] <%luckypineapple> Boats are easy isolation
[6:54:03] <+ChaosAethr> The Song is REtelling The story
[6:54:04] <adamant1333> tim burtin
[6:54:04] <rudiciuscaesar> boat sink, you get eaten or drowned
[6:54:05] <%jorniev> OCEAN IS SCARY
[6:54:05] <+VoytekBus> the boat is scary because of the implication...
[6:54:05] <The_B33F> Mia had sex with a mushroom?
[6:54:05] <Sol_Install> boats are terrifying
[6:54:05] <%Frost_Quill> So Mia legitimately got away with everything, while Ethan paid the ultimate price.  Argh.
[6:54:06] <seniormeatbox> Gaiden, Dead Aim, Rev 1, and 7
[6:54:06] <%weissguard> Salt Mine is terrible, Discount Jiggsaw (Lucas) is awful. Some of that game kinda stinks to high heaven.
[6:54:06] <dbag202> Redfield Bloodline
[6:54:06] <HeroToxiko> shinto water shit idunno
[6:54:07] <+kojibeoulve> being in the middle of the ocean is scary
[6:54:07] <%AzureGale> Boats are isolated
[6:54:07] <+Fenris_Alexius> water that you can't see in is scary
[6:54:07] <doc_ock_rokc> They can be
[6:54:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wow that was a fun 10 hours huh
[6:54:08] <connerhozer> Love that Coraline is happening in the credits
[6:54:08] <%Axellogic> Dead Space is about space Boats
[6:54:09] <eiyuusyndrome> OHHHH THESE ARE ALL THE LORDS
[6:54:10] <rudiciuscaesar> plane wreck, you just die
[6:54:10] <grandchickenlord> it's cause whenever there's zombies Kenny forces everyone into boats
[6:54:12] <sosuke5> Have you ever been on a boat? It's awful.
[6:54:13] <%Monkeyweed21> the Implication
[6:54:13] <%Blackleafx> But yeah that game was wild
[6:54:15] <$floralkami> I liked the boat level, tho
[6:54:15] <cardamomo88> the fact the mia is still alive after all her bullshit dude
[6:54:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> I feel like killing your new protagonist is not the best choice, but that could just be me.
[6:54:16] <thebalticguy1> Its good for games, easy imitations
[6:54:17] <+ZaralinGaming> Because of the Implication
[6:54:18] <Sol_Install> imagine sinking in the ocean and getting pull under with the ship
[6:54:19] <+ATorL> what even is this song
[6:54:20] <Frostydough1> is that the dukes horse?
[6:54:21] <%RetroCop87> IDEA: RE9 takes place on a sunken cruiser, like Poseidon Adventure
[6:54:21] <$floralkami> it was creepy
[6:54:21] <+Punchasaur> This is some cool Tim burton shit
[6:54:21] <+PlushMines> Ethan died how many times for his family and what was Mia even doing this entire time
[6:54:22] <+xddddsorandom> I don't understand most of the other stuff with the 4 people but I guess they just hated each other and were just there because they were getting used by Miranda... I guess
[6:54:23] <Heyestus> boats are claustraphobic and don't  have good sight lines that need rendering
[6:54:24] <Vikken141> RE5 also has a boat lv
[6:54:25] <KingSpunf> Diggin this new Björk song
[6:54:26] <pipboy344> @patstaresat Rev1 and Gaiden are the only full boat
[6:54:26] <+yusefHD> Too high for these credits
[6:54:26] <%bassoontyphoon> So if we established that Ethan’s clothes are also mold, then he lives on in his jacket right???
[6:54:27] <bestwaifuritsu> They gave so little of a shit about Ethan outside of a setup for turning Chris into a bitter old man
[6:54:27] <$RealThiele> rose gets all da powers
[6:54:28] <adamant1333> tim burton re 8
[6:54:28] <digaogrunge> Is this Bjork?
[6:54:29] <+Axle13j> I mean, the rest of the game is tight, enclosed and you can't escape lol Boat made no difference
[6:54:29] <+mrshazboto> What did I just come into?
[6:54:29] <%SunnyVarietyPack> A boat killed my dad
[6:54:30] <dinnydanny777> Who was the horse?
[6:54:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I feel bad for Horse man Magneto
[6:54:31] <+ALazo> an RE scenario writer got on a boat once and was very scared
[6:54:33] <Crystallux> its more of a story being told in song chat

[6:56:28] <MusouMiko> factory is 1000% a lab
[6:56:29] <mar_krow> chris mom can punch a boulder for his child
[6:56:30] <%CalderGaming> did he get all the goats
[6:56:30] <munitalprats> The factory was not the lab
[6:56:30] <+JonathLP> Good game, but Ethan deserved better.

[6:56:31] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Do you have more questions or less? After it is all said and done?
[6:56:32] <+mitzieter> mercenaries is very good it has rogue like mechanics
[6:56:33] <%SunnyVarietyPack> I beat re 4 so many times and never once saw the credits
[6:56:33] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Never forget, Ethan wouldnt be a Molded if not for Mia. She sucks
[6:56:34] <%RetroCop87> The fish guy's place is the lab

[6:57:00] <%Arweynn> Upper middle
[6:57:01] <%VashyronM> Did Pat just ruin his schedule?
[6:57:02] <dbag202> BSAA with Zombies tho
[6:57:04] <%Frost_Quill> I can't believe they made me give a shit about Ethan.  I really wanted him to make it out okay.
[6:57:04] <Scamsy> good game
[6:57:05] <TurranosOrn> How do you rate the four lords? Have you converted to Daddy Heisenberg?
[6:57:05] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt so is the canon actually that Rose was cut up into pieces and then reanimated like a weird baby frankenstein?
[6:57:06] <perpetualpotionmachine> The real loss was the Wolfsbane. What a cool gun
[6:57:06] <rudiciuscaesar> OH god, dead mommy?

[6:57:18] <doc_ock_rokc> In black face
[6:57:19] <deviljhojho_> this one had the best looking magnum. Altough i guess that one isnt much of a contest
[6:57:20] <fritz_dacat> No rocket Laucher finish was new
[6:57:20] <+kalyxchews> what did you think of Turbine Ted as a boss fight
[6:57:20] <Meltgar> Was there even an "assault rifle"?
[6:57:22] <%jorniev> IM SO GLAD CHRISSHOWED UP, TOTALLY SAVED THAT LAST PART

[6:57:30] <Chatterbox1991> IM PISSED ABOUT ETHAN
[6:57:33] <dbag202> Ethan, In the end, was so cool
[6:57:34] <%Broand> Wait is that miranda?
[6:57:34] <sothatsprettybrutal> the BSAA stuff is totally tacked on
[6:57:35] <majindusto> David Cockman enigmaKEK
[6:57:35] <%baronouroboros> I'm guessing Ethan is actually immortal
[6:57:35] <Th3rd3> BSAA is just like FBC back in the day now
[6:57:36] <boogaleeboo> STORY AIN'T OVER YET
[6:57:36] <MaritimeSpanker> @PatStaresAt which was your favorite of the bosses?
[6:57:37] <xxshadowxx416> but re 3 remake really good
[6:57:37] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> I saw the thing and I clapped
[6:57:37] <SomeAsianDood> So when does Joe Baker waltz in to the nuke blast and punch everyone?
[6:57:39] <%Broand> Miranda's MOM died?
[6:57:39] <T_Sasquatch> @MrRavine apparently its missing a lot of stuff and is vasically just recycled re2 but shorter and less variable
[6:57:40] <dan_g_v> burying people
[6:57:40] <+yusefHD> Lady d origin??
[6:57:41] <+superkeaton> fuckin BSAA zombies
[6:57:41] <mar_krow> ethan had moldy face so couldn't see it
[6:57:42] <Chatterbox1991> THEY DIDN'T NEED TO KILL HIM OFF
[6:57:42] <boogaleeboo> One last bit
[6:57:43] <blackjack8182> Definitely in the top 5 REs
[6:57:43] <munitalprats> I feel like the questions answered in this game werent the ones people were asking
[6:57:43] <$bognugget> it sounds like bjork
[6:57:43] <%sporeian94> BSAA is Secret Umbrella the whole time!
[6:57:43] <vilecrois> Was that last boss heavily pulling from Mergo's Wet Nurse or what
[6:57:44] <kinkade_77> I don’t think it’s bjork
[6:57:44] <Scamsy> Why is BSAA evil now
[6:57:44] <+Mejari> sequel or DLC?
[6:57:45] <Stipli> noooo Ethan face reveal though LUL
[6:57:45] <+krispen_wa> Considering Rose is like half-molded, getting cut up probably didn't mean anything to her
[6:57:45] <wasdsf> "I'm gonna kill Europe" - Chris Redfield
[6:57:46] <noyman2000> Eyy they showed it
[6:57:46] <+KaijuUltimax> The sequel hook gets worse keep watching
[6:57:47] <%IAMEVILORD> People like Ethan now!
[6:57:48] <Chatterbox1991> THATS SO DUMB
[6:57:48] <%Ranryu692> I was wondering how they were going to set up more
[6:57:48] <cardamomo88> WHY KILL THE PROTAG CAPCOM
[6:57:48] <%Frost_Quill> You never found that final fish. Maybe if you had better movement speed Ethan could have made it to the chopper.
[6:57:49] <a_mad_dragon_> it DOES sound like bjork
[6:57:49] <rudiciuscaesar> man, this game....wonder if the pandemic influenced this
[6:57:49] <+xddddsorandom> I feel like they didn't give enough answers about character's motivations
[6:57:50] <%jorniev> oh the mom died
[6:57:50] <Dio_TR> Dlc
[6:57:52] <TheSphereHunter> yep
[6:57:53] <+funkyjim69> I hope Chris calls Jill for backuo in RE 9

[6:57:54] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Chatterbox1991 I'm waiting for post credits before I get pissed
[6:57:55] <dinnydanny777> It's sad that Ethan and Mia didn't get to see each other at the end
[6:57:56] <%X2Eliah> ohh
[6:57:56] <LordOfThePoultry> EVIL BSSA
[6:57:57] <+xddddsorandom> sort of shallow in that way
[6:57:57] <user_naim> Compared to 7?
[6:57:58] <dbag202> Who is MC of next game if Ethan is gone? Chris again would be too much.
[6:57:58] <%LaughingCatt> yeah that Miranda
[6:57:59] <perpetualpotionmachine> Ethan was the coolest guy
[6:57:59] <+DBTenno> ooof
[6:58:00] <seniormeatbox> Eva

[6:58:02] <+Punchasaur> Is this what passes for music in Europe
[6:58:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Do you know why BSAA is evil now?
[6:58:03] <connerhozer> Might be DLC hook
[6:58:03] <plaguedoctor_syan> The only question in my head is if Ethan was dead how come he got Mia Pregnant?
[6:58:04] <+xxx420stoat69xxx> prepare for dimitrescu SFM porn
[6:58:04] <+KilogramHours> Who is this?
[6:58:04] <squeakyclarinet> Duke?
[6:58:06] <%hq_residential_house> yeah it looks like they want to start moving the meta story forward again imo
[6:58:08] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> they'll remake re1 to make the new lore fit
[6:58:09] <+NoriBasket> I really did get a Mergo's Wetnurse vibe
[6:58:10] <+KawaiiJetty> honestly looking at Mia helps me getting angry easily now lol
[6:58:11] <+rathekingofthesun> How you like that PT baby Pat?
[6:58:11] <%TheLakinessMonster> Where does Ethan rank in RE power scaling?
[6:58:11] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt do you think there will be more about Duke in a DLC?
[6:58:12] <dan_g_v> oh no, she's coughing blood!
[6:58:15] <%jorniev> now this is like RE 4
[6:58:15] <seniormeatbox> @PatStaresAt Do you think RE9 is gonna be first person?
[6:58:17] <$RealThiele> DUKE???
[6:58:17] <+KilogramHours> WAIT IS DUKE MIRANDAS FATHER?
[6:58:17] <%MajorCrasher> Rose is the next protagonist
[6:58:18] <dan_g_v> it's the anime disease!
[6:58:20] <+funkyjim69> Chris better callJill for back up in the next game
[6:58:20] <+SilverObi> is the BSAA HQ gonna be DLC or the next game though
[6:58:21] <+TheBitingIrish> The TB NotLikeThis

[6:58:24] <KingKZ> Watch them make us play as Mia in RE9.
[6:58:24] <NireFuster> DUKE BLEW UP LMAO
[6:58:25] <notsoy> this time Eva was the dead daughter instead of the dead mother
[6:58:25] <Vertigheist> so how did miranda get immortality
[6:58:26] <wasdsf> He comes from the money dimension
[6:58:26] <doc_ock_rokc> @TheLakinessMonster Mr x level
[6:58:28] <Sol_Install> they need to talk about teh duke tho
[6:58:28] <+kalyxchews> ethan winters will return in RE10: moldvelations
[6:58:29] <%Niney_Who> I hope the duke rolls around punching things
[6:58:30] <Khorneflakes_> LUL Duke DLC action
[6:58:30] <NeroInfinite> I doubt duke gets explained at all
[6:58:30] <KingSpunf> Miranda was a man!?
[6:58:31] <deviljhojho_> the duke must remain mysterous for the benefit of all
[6:58:32] <dbag202> So what is Duke?
[6:58:32] <+lusius94> plague
[6:58:33] <fuji_92> Ethan man, he deserved better BibleThump
[6:58:33] <Gorgs7> That dude, just "Hey look and the evil mold over there!"
[6:58:33] <+xddddsorandom> "I don't know how I work either" basically the writer saying shut up
[6:58:34] <sandwichpeddler> I can't believe the Spanish Flu cause the RE series
[6:58:34] <twoto858> Duke totally works for the Connections
[6:58:36] <+Extrallent> I kind of want the Duke to remain mysterious.
[6:58:36] <%Ranryu692> this is how Miranda becomes is this how Miranda becomes immortal? Is her dad the Duke?
[6:58:37] <reonome> rip duke
[6:58:37] <sweatch0> duke is dad
[6:58:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> IS DUKE THE DAD?
[6:58:38] <connerhozer> Wish Ethan just had super powers at the end
[6:58:38] <%MonsterEnvy> I don't think Duke exploded
[6:58:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Call me crazy but I get the sense Ethan's not really dead
[6:58:39] <GandhiTheTerrible> The Duke's already cool enough
[6:58:40] <karl_rex> Chris DLC?
[6:58:41] <munitalprats> Duke is god
[6:58:41] <%hq_residential_house> DUKE AKA LARGE KING
[6:58:43] <+FlappySeal_> Duke's gonna slim down like Bob from Tekken and be the next star
[6:58:43] <pikapie> LUL
[6:58:44] <%trekkie11041> the duke might as well just be death
[6:58:44] <nzrai> ethan will return 2 games later to become the strongest mold
[6:58:46] <+NoriBasket> Playable Duke in Resident Evil Karts
[6:58:46] <PumpAction> LUL
[6:58:46] <squeakyclarinet> Like Yakuza?
[6:58:47] <%furiousfurioso> along with his friend the RE4 merchant
[6:58:48] <%cephalon_nyt> I was kinda hoping they;d explain Lucas. oh well.
[6:58:48] <%Niney_Who> so this is all the Spanish Flu's fault
[6:58:48] <+jimmyjams1688> This is telling the Villiage's Pet Semetary story of ressurection
[6:58:48] <%RetroCop87> I bet the Duke is the Connections
[6:58:48] <digaogrunge> Ethan comes back as new Molded Wesker in RE9
[6:58:49] <seniormeatbox> @PatStaresAt The Duke is friends with the Merchant

[6:59:10] <%Ranryu692> I feel like the fact that they didn't show Ethan's face means he isn't permanently dead
[6:59:10] <%blutzwavedave> Is Claire gonna infiltrate BSAA Europe, get captures, and sent to a prison island? Is RE9 gonna be CVX2?

[7:08:42] <+Ran196> future gun
[7:08:42] <cardamomo88> i really dont like that they kill ethan tha sucks
[7:08:42] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Is RE just gonna be Jojo's middle Arc where it's just 3 of the children of old characters?
[7:08:42] <Dio_TR> BORUTO
[7:08:43] <Vertigheist> battle of the kids
[7:08:43] <dbag202> Evil BSAA and Good Umbrella
[7:08:43] <%Aeoneth> Old man Commander Chris
[7:08:43] <MaritimeSpanker> @PatStaresAt remember, Evie aged super fast in RE7
[7:08:44] <%Broand> Wait you can view ethans face in his figure?
[7:08:45] <+funkyjim69> So is Chris vs BSAA the DLC?
[7:08:45] <+Whiteowlsmith> either that or Rose ages incredibly fast
[7:08:45] <NicholasKane> chris survives the fight against bsaa?
[7:08:45] <a_mad_dragon_> nah
[7:08:46] <Crystallux> it would be a good way to kinda reset things a bit
[7:08:46] <%Monkeyweed21> THEY HAVE MANY OPTIONS
[7:08:46] <%baka_sugoi> F U T U R E
[7:08:46] <TurtlesAndTentacles> hope not
[7:08:46] <%ospreyworks> Won't that mean Sherry and what's his face will be like 40??
[7:08:46] <+LionKagura> @Chatterbox1991 nope fucking hated him never liked him to begin with
[7:08:47] <+jimmyjams1688> Yeah, you just did lol
[7:08:47] <%RetroCop87> you just did
[7:08:47] <NireFuster> IT'S JUST DEVIL MAY CRY LUL
[7:08:47] <mar_krow> BSAA EVIL??
[7:08:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah fuck it why not
[7:08:48] <sothatsprettybrutal> on the other hand they were flying to attack BSAA Europe like that very second
[7:08:48] <TG_Cid11> DLC might be the BSAA thing
[7:08:48] <artoflec> there is precedent to believe that she ages really fast
[7:08:48] <mythrilcrafter> Is Rebecca the new Jill?
[7:08:48] <penitentpendant> RE6 again
[7:08:49] <Frostydough1> @PatStaresAt TO AGGE UP ALEX WESKEWR MEMBER
[7:08:49] <%X2Eliah> Resident evil shippuden basically

[7:08:49] <BlindGato> Eveline Winters new MC
[7:08:49] <%sniffy77> FUTURE ZOMBIES
[7:08:49] <Khorneflakes_> I guess Chris solves that BSAA problem I guess????
[7:08:49] <Stipli> wait...then no Jill :( :( :(
[7:08:49] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Nosig Nal
[7:08:49] <Pyretech> yeah Chris
[7:08:49] <%maenos2> it'll give moira from rev 2 the chance to grow up
[7:08:50] <%Alig200> the BSAA using bioweapons/potentially evil hook has me interested, well that and Rose too.
[7:08:50] <Vikken141> Is it so they can make Alex Wesker a villain without the child body?
[7:08:50] <pi_in_the_sci> It may have only been 1 ytear
[7:08:50] <doc_ock_rokc> I have a feeling she aged quickly
[7:08:50] <+Gespens> RE9 is just DMC!
[7:08:51] <%dekkitout> Weren't you already?
[7:08:51] <%jorniev> NOT AGAIN

[7:08:51] <%hq_residential_house> everyone will just be wesker
[7:08:51] <%JoshManVGH> Fuck it, why not
[7:08:51] <TheMadBadger> Eveline grew super fast though so she could be like her @PatStaresAt
[7:08:52] <DeadNinja1> Sounds dope tbh

[7:08:58] <$bognugget> also bsaa eviiiiiil
[7:08:58] <+D00msDayDan> imagine what kinds of BOWs they'll come up with 20 years in the future
[7:08:58] <$alliedmastercompy> To be honest, it was in the late 90's for like a decade
[7:08:58] <%baka_sugoi> JAKE
[7:08:58] <+Vigonept> Ethan 2.0
[7:08:58] <slimslimjim88> If only heisenberg had GUN
[7:08:58] <SVER_Otter> but the BSAA
[7:08:59] <+LazyBumNetwork> Ethan should die at the end, but so should MIA
[7:09:00] <+chaumiester> OR..... Or..... they can retcon everything..... again
[7:09:00] <%Frost_Quill> That or we never see Rose again.  Both are possible.
[7:09:00] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Her partner should be Sherry
[7:09:01] <NeroInfinite> I Guess they'll jsut do wahtever now
[7:09:01] <notsoy> i mean, didn't we JUST play a character with superpowers?
[7:09:01] <xxshadowxx416> so sherry again
[7:09:01] <%Mendin> Can we have a buddy cop teamup of Shelly Birkin & Rose
[7:09:02] <+krispen_wa> SILENT HILL 3
[7:09:02] <KeiPrime> you already DID with SHERRY and JAKE
[7:09:02] <Mattais88> Lets be honest, they've had superpowers for a while
[7:09:02] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt So does this mean now we have Jake, Sherry, AND Rosemary as the Trio of Bio-Children?
[7:09:03] <+gespenst25> This is Devil May Cry all over agaon smh
[7:09:03] <lloyddboy> IS ROSE IN THE MERCENARIES????
[7:09:03] <KingKZ> She will be nerfed.
[7:09:04] <+Eddy21forsaken> you already played Sherry and Jake
[7:09:04] <+BIumen> i'm still pissed at that dude for calling her eveline lmao
[7:09:05] <%illusiveSaint> i mean ethan and chris and jill had small supers\
[7:09:05] <+Celarious> We're probably getting Chris going after the BSAA first
[7:09:05] <connerhozer> What if she’s the DLC?
[7:09:05] <Dio_TR> ITS BORUTO TIME
[7:09:06] <+GingerStrawhat> Aw man time passed Chris and Jill and company sounds awesome
[7:09:06] <SilverFeng> about time for goo guy bio weapons
[7:09:06] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Ethan kinda had superpowers

[7:09:07] <%hq_residential_house> @NoriBasket LUL
[7:09:08] <%walternatorz> You'll play as the asshole agent and have to save Rose.. again.
[7:09:08] <CrazyMedicine> Leon is way older now :(
[7:09:09] <Vyneci> Either that or Rose has the same condition as Eveline where she's aging 25x faster than normal
[7:09:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> hope not again
[7:09:09] <Sigma_190_Beta> I assume the next game will just be vs Evil BSAA
[7:09:09] <%Maids4lyfe> DOES SHE MARRY DARKNIGHT SPARDA
[7:09:09] <+Kyma1020> I guess team up with Jake and Sherry
[7:09:10] <BanSenpai> They said this wss a trilogy
[7:09:11] <gitdweezzy> what would be  re nine sub title

[7:09:17] <mythrilcrafter> Rose teams up with Natalia
[7:09:17] <dan_g_v> it's very late, even Gief and Emlo are not here

[7:09:47] <%AllenDeadman> Freakozoid team
[7:09:47] <Zebroneath> Freak Team, lets go

[7:09:57] <samazam94> what about jake?
[7:09:57] <mariosonicboss> make jake good
[7:09:58] <noyman2000> That would be good
[7:09:59] <%baka_sugoi> Jake, sherry and rose
[7:09:59] <dbag202> Live television with footage of Chris Punching a boulder
[7:10:00] <mythrilcrafter> Where's Moria
[7:10:00] <%hq_residential_house> everyone's power level is rising SO FAST
[7:10:00] <%weissguard> "Yes, Aunty Valentine~"

[7:10:03] <+CyprienCole> chris was mutated by the t virus
[7:10:04] <+Mejari> The Mold, Jill, the Mold!
[7:10:04] <%MelBrooksKA> Can we get Sherry in a good game period?
[7:10:05] <%Axellogic> Would that be CP if she ages fast
[7:10:05] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt I assume Chris mentions punching a boulder when he tries to convince men to impregnate his sister.
[7:10:07] <+LunarDensetsu> wasent ther a Rose in the RE movies?
[7:10:07] <mattdaddyd101> And jake
[7:10:08] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Cherry acting as Rose C.O would be great
[7:10:09] <connerhozer> Chris won’t shut up about the Boulder punching
[7:10:09] <noyman2000> Ya sandwich
[7:10:10] <bestwaifuritsu> Sherry, Rose, Jake...AND ASHLEY
[7:10:12] <PanicSwytch> SHERRY, ROSE AND JAKE ARE THE NEW SQUAD
[7:10:12] <MaritimeSpanker> can't we just get Wesker in a Wheelchair trynna repair himself?
[7:10:13] <%3d_pbandj> RE Bioware Avengers
[7:10:14] <HeroToxiko> Jake doesn't exist lul
[7:10:15] <Gorgs7> Sheva's an insufferable gossip, that's why she's not on the team anymore
[7:10:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> notice how they always say blondes are super strong.....
[7:10:19] <rosemon5001> understandable
[7:10:19] <TurbulentGun> You think everyone trashes on that dumb boulder scene behind  Chris' back
[7:10:20] <%HitchhikingThrough> fair, have a good night
[7:10:22] <%illusiveSaint> pat is too powerful
[7:10:24] <+mental_mashup> Jill may or may not have crazy super powers now
[7:10:25] <+yukichocomilk> play the extra stuff
[7:10:27] <fuji_92> do mercenaries
[7:10:28] <%Frost_Quill> Is Ethan gonna be the new Wesker?  Is Ethan somehow the ORIGINAL Wesker???
[7:10:29] <Stipli> Also the REX shirt is aweosme!!!
[7:10:29] <Firesparks> don't forget moira

[7:10:31] <+Celarious> Sherry and Rose go to work at this really cool shop called "Devil May Cry"
[7:10:31] <SomeAsianDood> I imagine sheva probably doesn't shut up about the boulder punching
[7:10:32] <comicalmond9135> its only 10 hours
[7:10:33] <NireFuster> Good job beating the game Pat
[7:10:33] <Vyneci> Mercenaries grinding strim when? KomodoHype
[7:10:36] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Disco is still waiting
[7:10:37] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[7:10:38] <%condemned_15> thoughts on Lost Judgement?
[7:10:39] <+EmptyMug> Stream mercenaries?
[7:10:40] <Firesparks> sherry, rose, jake, and moira
[7:10:41] <%HitchhikingThrough> Leprechaun Hustlers
[7:10:41] <KingSpunf> Jolly Good work lads
[7:10:41] <+Based_Moose> Are there any Resident Evil bosses that don't turn into gross disgusting monsters?
[7:10:42] <mythrilcrafter> New cast is Moira, Rose, Jake, Sherry, and Natalia
[7:10:43] <butcherbirb> himself?
[7:10:45] <+rathekingofthesun> Damn. I was really hoping for a Wesker bio-ghost
[7:10:47] <Firesparks> the RE avengers
[7:10:48] <%ClericOfSparda> Leprechaun are underrated
[7:10:49] <genmypoweralready> Resident Evil: Avengers when
[7:10:50] <$realm_forge> They’ve introduced a next gen team member in almost every game since 5
[7:10:53] <NeroInfinite> disco is still waiting Pat
[7:10:57] <$RealThiele> pat in the past with gold
[7:10:58] <%ospreyworks> So, with all that. What is actually the point of remaking 4?
[7:11:14] <%Aeoneth> I'm still reeling from Dragon Dimitrescu
[7:11:14] <+mental_mashup> @ospreyworks Money
[7:11:17] <televisedrevolting> The Dance Floor awaits. On Tuesday. Or Wednesday if you feel like Nier, I guess.
[7:11:18] <+LazyBumNetwork> Dude, whens TNG streams? I want Pat, Plague, and Peach to comment while watching it
