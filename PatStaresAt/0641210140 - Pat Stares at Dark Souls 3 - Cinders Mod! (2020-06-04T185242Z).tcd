[0:17:56] <%arancet> they know, thats why they do it
[0:17:57] <%ElenaManetta> my ding dong bell scares the shit out of me

[0:23:44] <DesertPenguin> This is a PG-13 stream, how dare you
[0:23:44] <Arisato_II> I weight 53Kg, can't say
[0:23:45] <%nosubstancex> I think I gagged a little haha

[0:24:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> the bottom of my orb is always sweaty. :(
[0:24:04] <%huskarl_zap> GROM DA PAUNCH psaGoblin SMOrc
[0:24:06] <%heartlesshealer> When you get old, you either get an orb or a cave-in. Unless you exercise and simply stay ripped
[0:24:18] <%FacetiousAF> do not scratch and sniff your orbs, people. the belly button is there.
[0:24:20] <Jontman42> I've either been or bordered underweight my entire life so probably not soon
[0:24:22] <DesertPenguin> How serious were you in the first place?
[0:24:26] <boomstickery> science moves too quick and its really expe3nsive to keep up with research
[0:24:41] <%Nordguy> sci-hib!
[0:24:42] <boomstickery> no journals not cutting edge
[0:24:45] <%DappercatEsquire> is garbage
[0:24:49] <Shishi1205> Big garbage
[0:24:53] <DesertPenguin> Pat is talking like an adult right now. I'm scared
[0:24:55] <%heartlesshealer> accessing research papers costs money
[0:25:02] <boomstickery> we had a whole module on how shitty they report biology
[0:25:11] <%DappercatEsquire> "Study says X" "Study shows no correlation with X"
[0:25:13] <%Nordguy> sci-hub for that pirated medical research
[0:25:13] <%Coystick> Eat dog brains, got oit
[0:25:14] <%g0atmeal> The world runs on headline clicks
[0:25:14] <SomeOtherNeb> it's ALL trash
[0:25:15] <%Broand> Holy shit dogs can cure cancer?!?
[0:25:15] <+ConLin_Arts_> FrankerZ
[0:25:17] <%Starotter70> We did it!
[0:25:19] <BlkFlameKami> PogChamp they can!?
[0:25:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's totally an article I saw on iflscience.
[0:25:22] <boomstickery> especially trying to divide teh world into things that cause adn things that cure cancer
[0:25:22] <+kapcommunist> who wants to read all that dry shit to syhnthesize information anyway
[0:25:26] <derap41> New study finds people with dogs live 5% llonmger
[0:25:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> All you need is your university to publish it... which requires singular peer review... its bad
[0:25:33] <%Mr_Pylon> Abstract: Dog Good
[0:25:36] <@SoFarFetched> Oh ClickBait LUL
[0:25:37] <IndoorSitup> "New study proves that dogs can TALK!" yeah bullshit
[0:25:41] <SoySocks> what a headline!
[0:25:42] <DesertPenguin> Clickbait
[0:25:44] <%heartlesshealer> The real study is "dog and people feel good when near each other because brain juice"
[0:25:45] <+ConLin_Arts_> serotonin is stored in the dog
[0:25:45] <DesertPenguin> The usual
[0:25:46] <Shishi1205> Dont believe their lies
[0:25:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> Study says my balls are filled with God Semen
[0:25:53] <j0ustar> wat
[0:25:55] <%Starotter70> God damn it
[0:25:56] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> So science reporting is basically sports reporting with wild clickbait headlines?
[0:25:56] <%g0atmeal> Split
[0:25:57] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt the worst part aboptu hwo shit sceince reporting is, is that all reproting is at elast as bad
[0:25:58] <derap41> ACHTUALLY!
[0:26:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> media outlets are scientifically illiterate.
[0:26:04] <DesertPenguin> Two different things
[0:26:07] <+Karebuncle> Science: Testing oin mice showed 3% decrease in tumor rate when given supplemental vitamin diet Science reporting: VITAMIN C CURES CANCER
[0:26:16] <%polypolipauli> DOGS CURE CANCER!!
[0:26:18] <%Giggalith> Whenever you see "X cures Y" just add "maybe, in rats" to the end
[0:26:25] <%Starotter70> Hollywood
[0:26:27] <Arisato_II> You study a degree just to get triggered by normal people, nice
[0:26:28] <%Laecerelius> just pulling off the thin cellophane covering of shit off of the truth
[0:26:29] <%heartlesshealer> hollywood
[0:26:31] <%Agami23> hollywood and tv shows
[0:26:31] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Hey Pat, have you played any of Gwent? They've just announced another expansion & the games been tons of fun lately
[0:26:32] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt pop psych in fiction in the 90s
[0:26:34] <DesertPenguin> Because Hollywoood
[0:26:37] <%Mrbaconator> cuz morons
[0:26:38] <%afronooch> Hollywood
[0:26:40] <%valriot> YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT CURES CANCER?! PogChamp PogChamp
[0:26:41] <smuggleruncle> dog ate the rat with cancer = cancer defeated
[0:26:41] <%Broand> And then you turn the newspaper page and believe every word- Murray gellmann effect
[0:26:42] <avidneptune> Have you talked about Attack on Titan on stream yet?
[0:26:46] <DesertPenguin> Hollywood lumps it all together
[0:26:47] <%TheFramedWarlock> Because writers don't know psychology
[0:26:47] <KoyaMusa> ah pat can contain his nips i see
[0:26:48] <Zaku_III> Hearing voices = multiple people in your head if you're dumb as hell.
[0:26:54] <derap41> And its sometimes faked
[0:26:55] <Them00n> Some Psychologists don't even think DID exists.
[0:26:55] <Texascourierlive> some people think its fake
[0:26:57] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Schizo started as a catch-all for psychosis conditions iirc
[0:26:58] <Ipsenscastle> the 'schizo'/ schism prefix suggests 'split', is all, I think it's just an evocative word
[0:27:01] <SoySocks> i assume the "hearing voices" part
[0:27:02] <$Ziegsy> I have schizophrenia. Despite being an adult My brain tells me theres monsters in the dark. Its fucking wild
[0:27:02] <SaltyGuyMan> I know someone who has DID and it's WILD
[0:27:03] <boomstickery> voices = lsiten to the voices? i dont knwo
[0:27:09] <%Ganerumo> I've interacted with like three people with multiple personalities and it's really strange
[0:27:10] <%g0atmeal> Apparently mental illness = crazy interesting characters
[0:27:11] <DesertPenguin> More than one voice. That's as far as they got
[0:27:14] <Shishi1205> Because they make for interesting stories maybe
[0:27:16] <SubjectTea> theres a youtuber that records her DID
[0:27:17] <+LiveStreamOnyx> mischaPls
[0:27:19] <%Ynkubus18> All mental health is effectively the same in many movies, annoyingly
[0:27:24] <SubjectTea> its really interesting
[0:27:25] <cureneckbeard> Remember that one Voyager episode where they all get diagnosed with Dysphoria Syndrome but it's actually because they got brainwashed to work on a planet

[0:28:51] <%FacetiousAF> both of the pauls are trash, ye?
[0:28:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Logan Paul is just as big a piece of shit as his brother. He said a good thing, but that doesn;t make him a good person
[0:28:54] <%Ganerumo> instagram clout chasers out there trying to make money
[0:28:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Again, I propose the idea, cannon into the sun.

[0:29:12] <%cowardman93> the looters are the ones holding things back more than anyone
[0:29:13] <%missingangle> Logan Paul just did a video calling out the racist bullshit going on. How did he end up being the better Paul brother in this one instant?
[0:29:14] <IndoorSitup> Some people out there need a good punch in the face.
[0:29:14] <%g0atmeal> Humans suck
[0:29:18] <%Laecerelius> Police are busy beating up peaceful protesters! Time to do crime!
[0:29:18] <%Agami23> @keyoray he is a shitty influencer that got picked up by disney and was caught looting and stuff
[0:29:18] <SomeOtherNeb> reminds me of that Harry Potter actor that got arrested for looting in London years ago
[0:29:21] <jhonxiolonn> That's always like that. Or just paid groups to create false positives

[0:30:55] <boomstickery> and have removed all their cops in toys
[0:30:59] <DesertPenguin> Don't worry about [ BLANK ], let me worry about [ BLANK ]
[0:30:59] <%rytyoung> Lego are chill
[0:31:01] <%Taisuru> Hell yeah Lego
[0:31:01] <$renyrells> man thats like 1 death star set
[0:31:02] <%heartlesshealer> Lego's generally been alright for a while, but brand
[0:31:02] <SoySocks> they can write off charities
[0:31:03] <SilverFaustX> ben n jerry got arrested in la riots
[0:31:04] <buffaloaf13> Is that better or worse than Randy saying " BUY DUKE NUKEM TO SHOOT PIG COPS!"?
[0:31:05] <%valriot> LUL
[0:31:05] <CrabSlacks> Ben and Jerry's is ride or die
[0:31:05] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt By the by dude, when you get the chance please check your twitter DM. I left you a message there after you Discord notice. If not I totally understand.
[0:31:05] <DesertPenguin> Tax cuts
[0:31:07] <+Delenay> they could have done that at anytime
[0:31:08] <derap41> Yup
[0:31:09] <%dyedeme> Kicked in 4 million dollars and ended cop and White House sets*
[0:31:10] <%dashdodger> thats wrong
[0:31:10] <%cvp5127> yes
[0:31:13] <boomstickery> theuir giving up one of their staple lines of polcie
[0:31:17] <%UvBenServed> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[0:31:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ben and jerry is also rad
[0:31:18] <jhonxiolonn> yeah
[0:31:18] <%Ganerumo> they also stopped advertising all the police-related lego sets @PatStaresAt
[0:31:19] <Picia000123> yeah
[0:31:19] <DesertPenguin> But we care, totally
[0:31:20] <KoyaMusa> not to mention the good will they generated because of it
[0:31:21] <%polypolipauli> "Crime parties"? It sounds like you're putting property ahead of lives Pat
[0:31:21] <Ipsenscastle> Lego requested all their Police and White House sets pulled too though, that's legit
[0:31:21] <WhitePantherZ> its also essentially advertising
[0:31:22] <derap41> Or they donate to their own charity
[0:31:23] <DesertPenguin> Yea that's okay
[0:31:23] <marvel877> They also pulled the police toy sets
[0:31:24] <DesertPenguin> Charity
[0:31:24] <%Ynkubus18> Legos been on the ball for helping out in a lot of things over the years
[0:31:25] <%trustycoyote> Everyone wins
[0:31:26] <$Ziegsy> LEGO also removed avertising for police sets and the white house sets
[0:31:26] <SubjectTea> Ben & Jerry wants to dismantle white surpemacy
[0:31:26] <+Fooguwu> and also it was the equivalent of pocket change to them
[0:31:26] <%afronooch> its balances out
[0:31:28] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt How about Ben and Jerry's actually out protesting?
[0:31:29] <%aishman> Also BEN AND JERRIES GOT ARRESTED. Got they fucking protested. Got I'm gonna eat some Ben and Jerries RIGHT NOW
[0:31:29] <%dekkitout> It's a Pyrrhic victory
[0:31:30] <%delilah4you> That money shouldve been going to chairty already
[0:31:30] <Sol_Install> Yea they pull their police toys off
[0:31:31] <DesertPenguin> It sucks, but at least it went somewhere
[0:31:31] <j0ustar> hey man, 4 million is 4 million
[0:31:31] <SomeOtherNeb> I can live with that
[0:31:33] <SomeOtherNeb> everyone wins
[0:31:34] <%Starotter70> Sure
[0:31:34] <KahnWick> Corporate consideration /s
[0:31:35] <%R3Roundabout> They also switched their supply lines to make medical supplies
[0:31:35] <%Laecerelius> Tax breaks for charity exist to promote rich people and corps to do charity or else they never would
[0:31:36] <%ElenaManetta> Tax breaks encourage charities
[0:31:38] <katocrimson> they can create a "charity" for tax break purposes
[0:31:39] <derap41> They can donate to their own charities too
[0:31:42] <%valriot> Did the Nintendo matching donations get confirmed? Thats crazy
[0:31:42] <+keyoray> @Agami23 o_0 okay, i really need to make sure they are not on now.
[0:31:42] <%missingangle> Yeah it's kind scummy, but the charities get the money, at least, that's what's important
[0:31:45] <%ElenaManetta> Otherwise no one would do it
[0:31:45] <$Chatterbox1991> It's actually a good idea in all honesty
[0:31:46] <%asurite_warrior> no zeno blade?
[0:31:49] <DesertPenguin> That way they can donate and still have money to do things they were gonna do anyway
[0:31:51] <Picia000123> Brand is a brand but It's always something
[0:31:51] <derap41> TTW
[0:31:53] <%Pilzkun> Money talks
[0:31:53] <avidneptune> Have you talked about Attack on Titan on stream yet?
[0:31:54] <IndoorSitup> Oh Pat you Cynical Cindy
[0:31:55] <%Coystick> Feet mod
[0:31:55] <%heartlesshealer> oh, didn't know about the supply line stuff, neat!
[0:31:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> Corporations care only about PR and money. Every action they take reflects that. They couldnt care less about the cause of the charity they donate to
[0:31:59] <+kapcommunist> Macho Man Mods
[0:32:01] <derap41> QoA mods
[0:32:02] <Shishi1205> Like the French rich dudes with Notre Dame that will recieve so much money for their donations
[0:32:02] <j0ustar> Xenoblade was a one-off
[0:32:10] <InvisibleMan101> yes
[0:32:14] <%g0atmeal> I've never enjoyed weight limits in games
[0:32:19] <KoyaMusa> what mod fixes dead money
[0:32:20] <derap41> Quality of Life mods
[0:32:21] <%trustycoyote> Looking at you Dragon's Dogma
[0:32:21] <%g0atmeal> They don't add anything to the game
[0:32:22] <jhonxiolonn> Just like what cinder does
[0:32:23] <%aClassySkelly> so the cinders mod for the most part
[0:32:24] <+Your_heals> The XCOM2 mod that removed the round-timer limit
[0:32:25] <$Chatterbox1991> oh yeah
[0:32:27] <koffeemancer> Big tiddy mods tho
[0:32:27] <%heartlesshealer> More restrictive than Oblivion?
[0:32:30] <$Chatterbox1991> that was some shit
[0:32:30] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> Or the fall damage mod on TW3
[0:32:30] <%g0atmeal> Especially single player games
[0:32:36] <%Pilzkun> Pat are you saying that your favorite mods aren't the ones that let you play as an anime
[0:32:37] <j0ustar> carryweight can suck a dick. if you give me a loot game, let me carry all the shit
[0:32:38] <urkleturtle> but what if sucking ass is all I know to do?
[0:32:43] <%jpf1256> I despise carry weight

[0:41:41] <CrimsonCore90> The video is still up to see canadian man lose his way
[0:41:42] <%rytyoung> Apex is kinda similar
[0:41:42] <IndoorSitup> EVERY NEW HERO WAS WORSE THAN THE LAST
[0:41:45] <AvailableThor> I played Overwatched for years since beta, not anymore, but you know, you're not wrong....
[0:41:46] <SubjectTea> AND THE NEW HEROES ARE TRASH
[0:41:48] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Name 1 hero they added other than Ana who made the game better?
[0:41:49] <%cvp5127> cant patch out the porn
[0:41:50] <boomstickery> same thign with heroes fo the storm
[0:41:51] <%Agami23> the only time they made a fun update was free for all deathmatch. because playing that as ana was great
[0:41:51] <Picia000123> The "You've gotta play nice with your team" THe Game
[0:41:53] <KoyaMusa> how did they nerf mercy today?
[0:41:54] <derap41> They're slowly training the players to accept more and more trash
[0:41:55] <classypigeon234> the best part of overwatch is the porn
[0:41:58] <%Captainflipsy> But let's buff bastion again, says the worst game community
[0:42:00] <AvailableThor> YES
[0:42:04] <%Daniel_Is_I> Roadhog was ruined
[0:42:07] <%FacetiousAF> @cvp5127 hear me out... let them patch IN the porn
[0:42:07] <%dekkitout> I mained Sym at launch- it was always down hill come to think of it
[0:42:08] <xWanderingFlame> YES
[0:42:09] <AvailableThor> BETA WAS SO GOOD
[0:42:09] <%Niney_Who> "Let's never fix Reinhardt and Doomfist lol"
[0:42:10] <Them00n> Looking forward to Overwatch Classic in 5 years.
[0:42:10] <iosephe> Yup
[0:42:11] <nepwar> so its on the opposite trend on no man sky
[0:42:13] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[0:42:13] <+Fooguwu> I miss golden age TF2
[0:42:13] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> I miss old OW, tbh
[0:42:14] <+firmlygraspi1> 100% agreed
[0:42:15] <SubjectTea> ANA WAS THE LAST GOOD ADDITION
[0:42:15] <+Xelig> I miss everyone playing the same character and meme matches
[0:42:15] <%Mr_Pylon> Mercy was the only character early on that I loved playing =(
[0:42:15] <AvailableThor> ALSO YES
[0:42:15] <+vampireinarm> the first month of overwatch was the fucken best, then they pooped it
[0:42:17] <%Aydarkzero> Ranked LUL
[0:42:29] <@SoFarFetched> They gottta buff low picked characters so they can get picked more LUL
[0:42:31] <%cowardman93> Overwatch League killed the game and I called it the moment it was announced
[0:42:32] <%heartlesshealer> it bled into casual
[0:42:33] <derap41> Remember Duplicate heros?
[0:42:36] <Shishi1205> Toxic swamp zone
[0:42:38] <WhitePantherZ> OW ranked was toxic af
[0:42:42] <Daxalog> Your not even playing a game anymore
[0:42:44] <boomstickery> overwatch was never even as good as TF2
[0:42:44] <IndoorSitup> SWEATY TRYHARD MODE
[0:42:46] <+jiggy_snipe> moba toxic?
[0:42:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> no Genji
[0:42:48] <Sotetsu> Ranked is too much pressure tangSweat
[0:42:49] <%WhereIsWill> i played ana ranked. I KNOW THE SALT
[0:42:52] <Arisato_II> It's like you never played League, Pat
[0:42:55] <%Niney_Who> Competitive felt like the only thing that mattered but playing a match was like injecting Negative Emotion into your neck
[0:42:56] <SubjectTea> I enjoy ranked tbh but it can be frustrating
[0:42:56] <%Your_heals> @Mr_Pylon every patch made ana and mercy less fun kiiFeels killed the game for me
[0:42:58] <derap41> Remember all Bastion teams?
[0:42:59] <personmanthingg> im so sorry @WhereIsWill
[0:43:00] <+firmlygraspi1> FeelsBadMan
[0:43:01] <aubrea> what game is this about?

[0:43:05] <%Niney_Who> "Switch to mercy or I throw"
[0:43:05] <Redmannasah> @Fooguwu I got excited cuz I thought you meant Titanfall 2 but you mean Team fortress 2 dont ya tomatoDry
[0:43:05] <+IMCthulhu> it was
[0:43:07] <%Your_heals> @aubrea overwatch
[0:43:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> unga bunga?
[0:43:15] <%Your_heals> God i loved overwatch for the first year
[0:43:18] <aubrea> oh fuck i wish i could still love that game
[0:43:21] <%afronooch> Sweat or die
[0:43:22] <samiscoolbro> your right
[0:43:23] <xWanderingFlame> YES
[0:43:28] <+JoeSketchy> Remember when Torbs turret could reach halfway across the map?
[0:43:28] <swipperswapper> psaWhat_SQ
[0:43:32] <%dekkitout> I hated dive meta- then goats meta showed up and HOLY PHUCK!
[0:43:37] <Arisato_II> The Pat Gang
[0:43:37] <%valriot> LUL
[0:43:39] <WhitePantherZ> i found that it was easier to win ranked games in league with a bad team than it was in OW
[0:43:40] <%cvp5127> no fun allowed
[0:43:41] <%heartlesshealer> *heals half the team and throws out purple orb ONCE* "Moira fucking heal you bitch!"
[0:43:42] <%weissguard> Try liking Mei and finding out that she's trash and apparently needs the team to built around her for you to play at anything but a casual level.
[0:43:45] <%Your_heals> @PatStaresAt But dont worry, overwatch 2 kiiHorse kiiHorse psaPat
[0:43:45] <personmanthingg> i miss no limits
[0:43:47] <nepwar> @Redmannasah no one thinks about titanfall 2 anymore. i should know, i sit on the lobby for hours on end hoping
[0:43:47] <SubjectTea> rein/zarya is the best meta
[0:43:54] <%SharkMissile> My addiction to Mei porn has long outlived my love for Overwatch
[0:43:55] <Psyramics> killing dedicated servers was the worst thing to happen to Multiplayer shooters ever
[0:43:57] <@BigNaturalMan59> oh man i remember that
[0:43:57] <derap41> LUL loved that shit
[0:43:59] <SilverFaustX> lol
[0:44:00] <%ItsCaptainDisco> I've never really enjoyed Overwatch. Maybe it's because I suck at Shooters, but it just didn't seem fun
[0:44:01] <%dekkitout> @weissguard Sombra in a nutshell
[0:44:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> THE GORILLA CHANNEL
[0:44:06] <nepwar> Harambe Meta
[0:44:07] <%Mr_Pylon> @Your_heals yep, the Mercy changes just sapped a lot of the fun out of OW for me
[0:44:08] <%ItsCaptainDisco> I feel you @sharkmissile
[0:44:10] <SubjectTea> @heartlesshealer I FUCKING HATE MOIRA SO FUCKING MUCH HOLY SHIT
[0:44:10] <+IMCthulhu> meet in the gorilla dome
[0:44:13] <katocrimson> All Mei ice walls
[0:44:13] <+sirjonston> The banana slamma
[0:44:13] <%Aeoneth> Good ol dumbass strats
[0:44:14] <derap41> All Bastion was always my favorite
[0:44:14] <%Captainflipsy> @weissguard Mei's not the woooorst on payload but yes
[0:44:15] <%cowardman93> the worst matches are always the most fun
[0:44:16] <Robrime> Ever went all Torb on Nubani and did a dwarf fortress? I miss those days
[0:44:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:44:19] <cureneckbeard> dicks out for harambe
[0:44:20] <%dekkitout> Dwarf Fortress comp psaSkelmo
[0:44:20] <SummonerMagno> ranked did ruin overwatch
[0:44:22] <IndoorSitup> NO FUN ALLOWED
[0:44:22] <+UberWolfman> So making it more competitive Esports ruined it? Who knew Kappa
[0:44:27] <%IncredibleMeh> Overwatch immediately forgot it was trying to be TF2 after launch
[0:44:34] <+JoeSketchy> I loved Overwatch but when ranked came out? I went on the worse losing streak and quickly fell out of love with it
[0:44:35] <%kknutson4> They have that mode in Arcade sometimes
[0:44:42] <Picia000123> That's just people dumb
[0:44:42] <%Aydarkzero> that's grasping for straws
[0:44:49] <%heartlesshealer> @SubjectTea I mainly play Moira because I like orbs and NO ONE ELSE ever goes after Pharahs in the sky because people are dumb
[0:44:51] <+ElMaestroChoque> ElMaestroChoque subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:44:55] <%WhereIsWill> oh no
[0:45:00] <%heartlesshealer> glad I stopped playing
[0:45:00] <%dashdodger> shouldn't have said that
[0:45:01] <Redmannasah> That sounds terrible
[0:45:02] <%Broand> Don't say thaaat
[0:45:03] <Dark_Wint3r> I don't think OW was ever trying to be TF2
[0:45:05] <Picia000123> Why do you do this to yourself
[0:45:07] <yourliteraldog> How much of it is racial slurs or porn
[0:45:11] <%WhereIsWill> why would you do this
[0:45:13] <$Meow0369> Wat
[0:45:14] <%Coystick> What bout my wedding Proposal ?
[0:45:14] <nepwar> what the ratio to good to bad msgs
[0:45:15] <%missingangle> how many dick pics tho
[0:45:16] <KoyaMusa> because pat's real cool and doesn't have time for the little guy :^)
[0:45:17] <+R_BChe> did they send u feet
[0:45:17] <%Pilzkun> chat stunned
[0:45:23] <Iam_Dead> Time to spam pat's twitter with single word messages. Like Poop and pee.
[0:45:26] <%UvBenServed> WATCH/PLAY THIS THING I LIKE
[0:45:28] <%Aeoneth> Is it just me or does pat have a bit of a wave going on with his hair
[0:45:29] <yourliteraldog> Do you get nudes?
[0:45:35] <venomfury86> or DMC
[0:45:42] <%Broand> you have stairs in your house
[0:45:43] <CrimsonCore90> Spam pats twitter with overwaatch porn!
[0:45:46] <CurrySauseBandit> Do people just complain about smash players to complain about them now?
[0:45:52] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> is it just me or is the voice video synce slightly off? like 1/4-1/2 a sec
[0:45:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> UK GANG
[0:45:56] <aubrea> oh shit it just hit me there's a cam, it took me like 20 minutes to realize im not staring at the baby
[0:45:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> I SURE DID
[0:45:59] <+Nothing_Wild> I‚Äôm really glad I‚Äôm not the only one. OW was way more fun during the beta, and the first six months were good. But how they did the rank... it used to be the best of 3, going up to 5. But people bitched, and you had a circlejerk on this subreddit from people who never played it. I think a lot of them thought they were going to be grandmaster or something. Now the format is this awful time trial that you‚Äôll lose if you do something a second too late.
[0:46:05] <SubjectTea> @heartlesshealer the orbs are so annoying (more than scatter arrow) and her grasp is bullshit long and reaches around corners. she needs more skill than throwing orbs in a general direction
[0:46:05] <%FacetiousAF> orbs for the orb god
[0:46:06] <+R_BChe> i got warhammer and warhammer 2 dlc for total war for that event
[0:46:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> BEAT VORTEXT WITH LIZARDS 1ST TRY
[0:46:12] <+Jaysky> Deeeear Pat, what's it like not sweating constantly now?
[0:46:13] <Sotetsu> Skulls for the SkullGirls.
[0:46:17] <SomeOtherNeb> refresh the page, it's a Twitch thing
[0:46:20] <+theoriginalbigboy3535> @patstaresat glad someone mentioned Bug‚Äôs Fable to you, it‚Äôs pretty good and on Switch/other consoles too!
[0:46:21] <$renyrells> reload paige?
[0:46:24] <%Broand> zinders
[0:46:27] <+Nothing_Wild> I really wish it didn‚Äôt turn out like that.
[0:46:30] <%FacetiousAF> skulls for the skullgirls.
[0:46:32] <+Fooguwu> zinder me zaddy
[0:46:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Now Pat HAS to infuse his candlestick with dark Kappa
[0:46:38] <%traytr> you should be warned, Cinders has less bonfires
[0:46:41] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> @PatStaresAt it worked
[0:46:43] <+Castle_Kundarak> Usually.
[0:46:46] <DXLelouch24> I take it Pat defeated the A/C Raid boss?
[0:46:48] <%zestyArsenic> 1/3 at best
[0:46:53] <%deceptijamz> deceptijamz subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! I love you!!
[0:46:55] <Arisato_II> Math with pat
[0:46:58] <Zombrocom> Some of cinders bonfire placements are odd as fuck
[0:47:08] <aubrea> meanwhile runescape is out here with 93/99 being the halfway point
[0:47:09] <Shishi1205> Its cool
[0:47:11] <%WhereIsWill> V A R I E T Y
[0:47:11] <%OopsyDoops> pat I don't remember you saying this on the podcast but do you prefer Doom 2016 or Eternal?
[0:47:13] <%Aeoneth> Pick Quantum League
[0:47:17] <%heartlesshealer> @SubjectTea They really just need to destroy the reacharound bs. Like, I move my camera to aim at airborne opponents and heal orb if I'm too far to spray, but that reach around damage is too much for that far reach
[0:47:18] <+Fooguwu> All Pat Variety Hour
[0:47:22] <SomeOtherNeb> LYING_CAT. jpg
[0:47:27] <%kknutson4> Do a Card Game Week
[0:47:29] <cosmicdischarge> what game ?
[0:47:36] <derap41> 2016 for me
[0:47:42] <+Jaysky> I picked up Runeterra cause of Pat
[0:47:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> ETERNAL HANDS DOWN
[0:47:45] <+Jaysky> Damn you
[0:47:47] <cosmicdischarge> Eternal 100%
[0:47:47] <Shishi1205> 2016 is good, but eternal is better kinda
[0:47:51] <%WhereIsWill> needs more crouch button
[0:48:00] <Dr_Angelic> I also picked up Runeterra because of pat,curse you riot
[0:48:03] <InvisibleMan101> too many factories
[0:48:04] <%dekkitout> DoomE is more videogame
[0:48:06] <%valriot> yeah Eternal is just all new levels
[0:48:13] <Arisato_II> Dark Souls 2 says-
[0:48:19] <classypigeon234> dark candle
[0:48:19] <SomeOtherNeb> yeyeye
[0:48:19] <%DappercatEsquire> deep in those souls
[0:48:23] <%Dementedpenguin> Deep? Kreygasm
[0:48:24] <%traytr> be warned, theres alot less bonfires
[0:48:26] <greynob> does pat have discord?
[0:48:26] <%mckraven> I love the aesthetic of doom eternal more but I feel like some of the gameplay choices aren't as fun as 2016
[0:48:28] <SomeOtherNeb> no
[0:48:30] <%heartlesshealer> A GAME APPEAR
[0:48:32] <%Broand> Bad a job pat
[0:48:32] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Pat, have you played any of the Gwent standalone at all? Or Thronebreaker at all?
[0:48:32] <%Ner234> Oh nooo
[0:48:32] <jhonxiolonn> Finally vidya
[0:48:35] <Shishi1205> I love how Reggie is getting more down with murder and the devil now with eternal
[0:48:35] <classypigeon234> deepen the stick
[0:48:37] <%Dementedpenguin> Yes
[0:48:37] <%rytyoung> ohh
[0:48:37] <%shadylawyerman> shadylawyerman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hey, I hope all is well. Thanks
[0:48:39] <Shishi1205> yes
[0:48:39] <samiscoolbro> crouching makes me feel good tho
[0:48:40] <%weissguard> You're good.
[0:48:40] <%Ner234> Yes
[0:48:40] <%cowardman93> yes
[0:48:41] <venomfury86> for me Doom Eternal is a better game, but 2016 is still my favorite
[0:48:41] <TheyCallMeVawn> Doom Eternal is basically Devil May Cry
[0:48:42] <+saltytyrz> no
[0:48:42] <SomeOtherNeb> ye
[0:48:43] <%cowardman93> pat do good
[0:48:43] <NeroInfinite> Oh fuck whoi s this gremlin ?
[0:48:45] <$Dakuu75> Oh shit, Pat's face'n orb are back
[0:48:45] <%Broand> unfortunately
[0:48:48] <%heartlesshealer> Change?
[0:48:51] <%Captainflipsy> What a fuckin title theme
[0:48:52] <%jpf1256> ew video games in my talking stream
[0:48:52] <Arisato_II> Praise
[0:48:54] <%Starotter70> Oh?
[0:48:58] <Shishi1205> Does the mod dude even rest?
[0:49:00] <%rytyoung> You are ***
[0:49:02] <jhonxiolonn> And the bizarre adventures of Pat destroying the game continue
[0:49:02] <Zombrocom> Yeah,, 1.75 changed how catalyst scaling works
[0:49:04] <Arisato_II> El Hueso meets his brother?
[0:49:05] <SomeOtherNeb> that theme is still he bomb
[0:49:06] <%heartlesshealer> yay bugfixes
[0:49:07] <2Bs_USB_port> Kreygasm This music
[0:49:07] <Arisato_II> El Bonero?
[0:49:12] <%heartlesshealer> magic? o.o
[0:49:27] <%Starotter70> oooooh
[0:49:34] <derap41> Like in DS2
[0:49:36] <Dr_Angelic> ooooooooo
[0:49:38] <%heartlesshealer> Oh! Attribute affinity? Neat
[0:49:40] <Zombrocom> Perferred does 100%, all others do 80%
[0:49:41] <Personified134> Oh yeah this catalyst change is just patently awful
[0:49:47] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> That sounds sick
[0:49:50] <SomeOtherNeb> goost
[0:49:58] <Personified134> it just randomly nerfs half your spells for every catalyst
[0:49:59] <SubjectTea> @heartlesshealer samito said that moria should have her orbs act like a molotov and spread in an area. which is an interesting idea for a change to the function of the orb (have like 2-3 heal orbs and on cool down like a tracer blink)
[0:49:59] <Zombrocom> This catalyst change is getting changed next patch LUL
[0:50:05] <%heartlesshealer> If it's done well, it's actually neat
[0:50:13] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt Since the update, have you had controller problems? My controller will just disconnect randomly while playing wirelessly.
[0:50:13] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, and apparently some of the added catalysts are now terrible (like the Sorcerous Flame)
[0:50:15] <%Mendin> physical damage magic, so... force? dark spells?
[0:50:18] <%dashdodger> this sounds complicated for the sake of being complicated
[0:50:20] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[0:50:38] <+McFluffums> I had a fun experience with Cinders, where a few of my friends were playing it together, because of the way DS bans work they could play together on the "naughty boys" server. I couldn't get banned no matter what I did... I joined other peoples worlds as a character named "ban me" and noclipped into boss arenas, pulling the boss into the overworld for 3 days straight, no ban
[0:50:40] <+McFluffums> good times
[0:50:47] <IndoorSitup> DAS ALOTTA DAMAGE
[0:50:47] <Personified134> Thats A Damage
[0:50:54] <Shishi1205> No boulder?
[0:50:56] <%heartlesshealer> @SubjectTea That'd be neat, actually. Only problem is determining how the orbs pop off if they become molotov shots
[0:50:57] <$renyrells> THATS A LOT OF DAMAGE
[0:51:00] <%Mendin> Check out the cemetery past Gundyr again, Pat. That changed up too
[0:51:01] <%Starotter70> THAT'S A LOT OF NUTS
[0:51:04] <kazoomageddon> that is indeed A Damage
[0:51:07] <Arisato_II> Damage (1)
[0:51:09] <nepwar> thats big number
[0:51:16] <tubit> superchuuunks
[0:51:23] <dreamtemplar21> Wait did pat get his camera fixed?
[0:51:35] <DXLelouch24> Pat expert modes nuts i have enough xp to hit lv12 and its only ch1,also i crushed the base game of Cinders and you can get a slab from trial
[0:51:37] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[0:51:39] <%heartlesshealer> @SubjectTea Ah, but then they might have to change that newer healing-man's heal grenades...
[0:51:42] <Shishi1205> Damn poor Yhorm
[0:51:42] <%YakumoYomi> I had my fun with Cinders, but now I'm waiting on the big 1.4 update for Champion's Ashes (which is adding in a bunch of Bloodborne trick weapons)
[0:51:44] <SomeOtherNeb> JESUS
[0:51:46] <SilverFaustX> loud
[0:51:47] <%WhereIsWill> get fucked yhorm
[0:51:49] <jhonxiolonn> That Fp regen tho
[0:51:50] <%Starotter70> @dreamtemplar21 Pat no longer has his nipples out, so the camera is now on
[0:51:52] <CrimsonCore90> Super Chunk?
[0:51:55] <derap41> Balanced I see
[0:51:55] <SomeOtherNeb> why is the small man bullying a giant
[0:51:57] <Shishi1205> YOu should get some blue estus
[0:51:59] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Now do The trial to Get a slab
[0:52:04] <%toastybites> Is this Dark Souls or DBZ
[0:52:05] <%dekkitout> That Ameterasu is quite the problem solver
[0:52:05] <Arisato_II> This is mean
[0:52:05] <Shishi1205> To farm him even quicker
[0:52:07] <Arisato_II> Stop this
[0:52:09] <Personified134> Pat you really could use some Blue Estus
[0:52:11] <Benperson> oh sh** thorn with no storm ruler? mod seems good
[0:52:11] <TheZearGuy> God that‚Äôs just mean.
[0:52:12] <+kapcommunist> is this the scended spell?
[0:52:13] <%traytr> cinders makes casters a truly viable play style and i love it
[0:52:14] <Jontman42> because fuck actually playing the game
[0:52:16] <jhonxiolonn> PAT, go to newgame plus, now that You're broken
[0:52:16] <+twohitgood> this is quite the opposite of what prod was going through yesterday with the ds3 ascended mod and just impossibly difficult bs.
[0:52:17] <$Ziegsy> game a little loud for anyone?
[0:52:21] <%dashdodger> ruined
[0:52:24] <Zombrocom> RIP no hit run
[0:52:24] <professor_prick2001> This game is difficult
[0:52:28] <%heartlesshealer> Onion still dead
[0:52:28] <%sniffy77> Pat stop he's already dead!
[0:52:31] <AbnormallyLargeAnt> I wish I knew what build this was, seems like a good time
[0:52:32] <SomeOtherNeb> don't worry chat, the game expects you to do so OP later on
[0:52:33] <%toastybites> jesus what is that mana regen
[0:52:37] <SomeOtherNeb> late game bosses are TOUGH
[0:52:38] <buffaloaf13> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:52:38] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> say no to bullying
[0:52:38] <+Nothing_Wild> Huh. Magic looks really strong in this mod.
[0:52:42] <Chibi_Changa> Can you do a full caster build in Cinders? I've literally never made a mage any of my Souls playthroughs, but this has me tempted.
[0:52:47] <SubjectTea> @heartlesshealer true true, i guess have it work on hitting teammates and floor?
[0:52:53] <%Starotter70> Poor Yhorm
[0:53:01] <%kknutson4> Why not put on some Ashen flasks to make it faster
[0:53:02] <%heartlesshealer> Pat has a bunch of mana regen stuff activated via equipment, don't worry about that
[0:53:05] <%jpf1256> Jobbed
[0:53:05] <Lophostrix_> easier than the vanilla version
[0:53:06] <Personified134> HUGE QUEST

[0:53:08] <%MrBorisMakarov> that's fine
[0:53:08] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat you can get a primordial slab from trial completion if you have a curse on

[0:53:11] <DesertPenguin> Holy shit he upgraded off screen
[0:53:12] <%toastybites> "So I did some grinding offscreen"
[0:53:13] <Shishi1205> Beefy
[0:53:14] <DesertPenguin> Just a litlte
[0:53:14] <derap41> Fuckiong AGAIN pat
[0:53:16] <%traytr> @chibi_changa yes absolutely
[0:53:19] <jhonxiolonn> I think faith builds are less broken but still fun
[0:53:21] <+vampireinarm> OFF SCREEN GRINDING
[0:53:21] <SomeOtherNeb> it's FIIIINE
[0:53:24] <DesertPenguin> At least he's not wearing the OG Sauron armor
[0:53:25] <kazoomageddon> hey Pat you should use your symbol of avarice for soul grinding if you haven't already
[0:53:27] <%FacetiousAF> big. numbers.
[0:53:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Aldrich Faithful also have a good dark sorcery when you get to them.
[0:53:28] <%toastybites> grind more

[0:53:34] <%Bailey__gaming> grinding off screen is pats middle name
[0:53:34] <%Das_Bass> classic pat
[0:53:36] <SubjectTea> @heartlesshealer and i think bap's gun with the nades is okay for the most part, i wish the arc of it was less arc-y?
[0:53:36] <+AbnormalVoid> nothing
[0:53:37] <%cowardman93> I expect nothing less
[0:53:38] <Pobega> is recovering MP part of the mod? I haven't played since the DLC dropped, never seen that before
[0:53:38] <+saltytyrz> perfection
[0:53:39] <transporterthesequel> Just five its fine
[0:53:40] <DesertPenguin> Traitor lol
[0:53:41] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> sO I'vE beEn grInDinG oFF screEEN LUL
[0:53:41] <%weissguard> No Damage, 360 No Praise.
[0:53:41] <+Nothing_Wild> So Faith is actually viable in this mod?
[0:53:42] <%YakumoYomi> @Chibi_Changa Absolutely. Some of the DLC might be a bit troublesome, though. Lordran Remnants was a huge pain in the ass.
[0:53:44] <Bajumeru> !uptime
[0:53:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 53m 57s.
[0:53:48] <%thegalvanicpanic> "So I've been doing some grinding"

[0:53:54] <%Bailey__gaming> shromfire
[0:53:55] <TheArrow_> i was playing this mod the other day and i found a spear that doubles as a machine gun and it's pretty sick
[0:53:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> BETRAYAL
[0:53:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> @Nothing_Wild Faith is even more busted thann Dark

[0:53:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> the what?
[0:54:03] <%BoneofMalkav> psaElmo Thanks for the gift @gasgrave
[0:54:03] <DesertPenguin> Can you use Aldrich's crazy million arrows spell?
[0:54:03] <%heartlesshealer> @SubjectTea Would be worth testing. Though if orb needs a collision hit, then maybe they'll have to make the spray wider, but still short
[0:54:06] <+vampireinarm> bonshrire
[0:54:06] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The good old shrine fire
[0:54:07] <%Mendin> Check the cemetery please
[0:54:08] <+Order_of_Mystery> It wouldn't be a PSA dark souls stream without off-screen grinding
[0:54:13] <Shishi1205> Go from Wolnir into Irythil?
[0:54:18] <katocrimson> fight pontiff
[0:54:24] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat you can get a primordial slab from trial completion if you have a curse on

[0:54:31] <%Lizard0TM> you'll have a fun time getting to around level 200 for Ringed City DLC
[0:54:33] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt You could go fight Oceiros and get infinite teleporter
[0:54:50] <Zombrocom> Oh god, midir is a pain for a dark mage

[0:54:56] <DesertPenguin> Infinite teleporter/
[0:54:58] <DesertPenguin> ????
[0:54:58] <+Order_of_Mystery> @BliVru infinite teleporter?
[0:54:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> She's easier in phase 2 because she loses her command grab
[0:55:03] <%Ner234> Is this a bullying stream now BibleThump ?
[0:55:06] <Personified134> EXTREMELY HUGE
[0:55:06] <DesertPenguin> @BliVru what is that?
[0:55:11] <$Dakuu75> Ah yes... the Camera... the true boss of Dark Souls
[0:55:11] <the_sprankton> this is a weird dance-off
[0:55:13] <%heartlesshealer> @SubjectTea Well, I think everyone would appreciate less arc on Bap's grenades, but might lower his skill gate if the devs want it to be there
[0:55:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I went to Lothric Castle early in my playthrough and it was real fun
[0:55:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> YOU FOOL LUL

[0:55:58] <%YakumoYomi> @SilvaChariot0133 A boss added in the mod to replace Champion's Gravetender. You fight Ciaran, Ornstein (who is basically Nameless King), and Artorias (who is basicaly Gundyr) in succession
[0:55:59] <rubbersnake21> holy shit was that spell always in the game?
[0:56:00] <hyphenated_q> The taunt isn't really deserved
[0:56:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> Time for dead babby
[0:56:03] <SubjectTea> @heartlesshealer yep. only if blizz would listen to players like us who want change instead of having their head in the sand. cuz i do enjoy the game, just the new heroes for the most part suck so much.
[0:56:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> huh
[0:56:08] <%redrins> what a hero
[0:56:09] <Scrub_Seeker> @rubbersnake21 nope, mod spell

[0:56:53] <derap41> This is some DBZ power level
[0:56:53] <DesertPenguin> That spell is just Manus' moves

[1:02:47] <%masterpiecejeremy> masterpiecejeremy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Pat, your build makes Dark Souls look like a Shonen anime
[1:02:49] <$Sdeje> Not One Punch man
[1:02:51] <Zombrocom> You did not go up there
[1:02:52] <nepwar> they tring their best
[1:02:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> Are these the same "faction" of knights as the ones in the Cathedral or are they just generic huge angry knight bois
[1:02:52] <rekinom> Is dark OP in this mod or is everything this nuts?
[1:02:53] <+Order_of_Mystery> pat says begone thot
[1:03:09] <Zombrocom> Everything is OP, but you can turn on higher difficulty
[1:03:13] <Arisato_II> Magic overall is super buffed
[1:03:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> HES SO OVERLEVELD OMG
[1:03:21] <%Mitchellsocks> Was that the Yhargul helm?
[1:03:21] <Shishi1205> Have you guys seen the youtube channel where the dude pairs ds3 enemies to fight between eachother? Those Cathedral GS knights kick so much ass
[1:03:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @smallboops How far are you in? Lotta bosses seem to have at least small changes
[1:03:27] <bashful_bard> Stat caps are removed so everything should be nuts
[1:03:29] <%YakumoYomi> @smallboops There are some changes, mostly just stats. They replaced one of the DLC bosses in Ariandel with an arguably worse fight.
[1:03:29] <jdanov> i mean let's also remember he upgraded his weapon to like max NG+ status
[1:03:33] <%king_wragles> I don't believe it
[1:03:35] <Scrub_Seeker> there's new shit in that shortcut tho
[1:03:37] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> should still do that shortcut. Fun times.
[1:03:38] <Scrub_Seeker> cool new shit
[1:03:38] <+AbnormalVoid> I dunno
[1:03:41] <+AbnormalVoid> I need a few more angles
[1:03:41] <%Coystick> AngriestPat would've complained
[1:03:42] <OthoZen> lies
[1:03:42] <KorysHere> doctored
[1:03:48] <TomFrank> is anything really real? arent we just a simulation?
[1:03:49] <SomeOtherNeb> THESE PATRICKS WERE NOT PAID ACTORS
[1:03:55] <Zombrocom> I kinda miss the greatwolf, wish they just made it a 1 on 1 and buffed him
[1:04:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> you only ever see Pus of Man in Lothric, don't you...
[1:04:05] <%RVMSpeedWagon> eyy lets get it
[1:04:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> USE QUICKSTEP RING
[1:04:11] <thebestestkevin> im sad that of all the armors this mod adds, they never added the 'elite' black, gold, and blue version of the cathedral knight set
[1:04:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> Like various parts of the general castle compound
[1:04:12] <Scrub_Seeker> it is in the original
[1:04:12] <transporterthesequel> Are we sure this isn‚Äôt a crisis pat?
[1:04:19] <DesertPenguin> You have plenty of FP already
[1:04:21] <KorysHere> used to cut backstab by 50%
[1:04:30] <jhonxiolonn> fp regen
[1:04:30] <derap41> Does it even matter
[1:04:31] <Shishi1205> FAP is better I imagine
[1:04:32] <BliVru> both?
[1:04:34] <DesertPenguin> Ohhhhhhhhh
[1:04:42] <%FacetiousAF> wisdom.
[1:04:44] <BliVru> remove dark clutch ring
[1:04:44] <derap41> Like you're one shoting stuff anyway
[1:04:46] <+Order_of_Mystery> ditch the clutch ring
[1:04:49] <nepwar> reduces fp consumption. it seems the best
[1:04:49] <Arisato_II> MMO numbers
[1:04:57] <PeteyMcPickle> you're already OP what does it even matter
[1:05:01] <%heartlesshealer> let go of that Clutch
[1:05:01] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> I did the mod without dark clutch, and I still did bonkers damage...
[1:05:06] <derap41> You can't do more than 1 shot enemies
[1:05:14] <transporterthesequel> It always matters to the Goblins
[1:05:14] <DesertPenguin> No crystal here
[1:05:15] <%RVMSpeedWagon> nice
[1:05:16] <DesertPenguin> Not in vanilla
[1:05:19] <PanicSwytch> Why would I reduce my fap
[1:05:25] <DesertPenguin> Uh oh
[1:05:28] <DesertPenguin> That's the invasion sound
[1:05:30] <Ethel9727> Wait where do you find the blast fire vestiges that's so cool? :o
[1:05:48] <Ethel9727> black fire* rather
[1:05:54] <%RVMSpeedWagon> kill the dragon dadddd
[1:05:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> Ocerois best boss
[1:06:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Ethel9727 Transpose Wlonir's soul
[1:06:02] <BallerSwagBro9k> REVOLVER OCELLOTTE
[1:06:07] <SoySocks> did the game have that UI-hiding option before, or is that specific to Cinders?
[1:06:07] <%YakumoYomi> I think you get Black Fire Vestiges from transposing Wolnir?
[1:06:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> *Wolnir
[1:06:13] <Chibi_Changa> So does a weapon's enchantment change the scaling for magic, like a weapon that can cast hexes infused with the int infusion makes hexes scale with mainly int instead of int+faith?
[1:06:15] <Ethel9727> @Valentinius_Anodyne Thanks <3
[1:06:20] <%MrBorisMakarov> @SoySocks it's in base game
[1:06:25] <Maydiz> how he is so powerfull?? x.x

[1:09:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> Booooo
[1:09:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> I mean the entire reason the plot of Dark Souls 2 happens is because Nashandra KNOWS that Looking Glass Knight would beat her, so she's not even gonna try

[1:11:32] <+Jaysky> I liked the part where you dodged back and used the dark soul
[1:11:37] <%YakumoYomi> I'm curious if Pat will be this smug against the Lordran Remnants (two of which have significant Dark resistance).

[1:13:24] <davey0000> Hey Pat, don't know how much you've been dipping into League outside of Runeterra, but did you see one of the new champions is literally just gonna be Dante with a full blown Style Meter?
[1:13:25] <+Jaysky> Ocelotte? OCELOTTEEEE
[1:13:29] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Honestly, this sound effect is probably the most unsettling thing in all of Soulsborne
[1:13:32] <%FacetiousAF> sounds like paige waking up Kappa
[1:13:34] <%sniffy77> Is this guy a furry>
[1:13:34] <Shishi1205> Yes
[1:13:34] <SomeOtherNeb> My dear, little Ocelotte.

[1:13:36] <Gallhint> Did cinders mod the baby back in
[1:13:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> He's such a cool boss
[1:13:40] <%dashdodger> cathedral of the deep is pretty bloodborne
[1:13:41] <SomeOtherNeb> I LOVE Oceiros' voice acting
[1:13:45] <KoyaMusa> too be fair there's a good deal of bloodborne in this game
[1:13:45] <%Coystick> COWARDS
[1:13:46] <jhonxiolonn> best dialog from a boss

[1:14:06] <katocrimson> it's that baby in jojo part 4
[1:14:11] <Scrub_Seeker> @Jontman42 you could say that about a lot of bosses in this game
[1:14:12] <%Coystick> They're too busy with gay incest
[1:14:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> As are Ringu/Ju-on Girl Centipedes
[1:14:17] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Literally just swab "dragons" with "old blood". Boom, Bloodborne boss.

[1:15:00] <%zestyArsenic> GET THAT DICK
[1:15:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> they should have unhidden the baby
[1:15:02] <derap41> Did heh always have a huge nutsack?
[1:15:05] <%dekkitout> No- Oceiros bad! BAD DRAGON!
[1:15:06] <%YakumoYomi> @cylish They're too cowardly to make the babies visible
[1:15:06] <%heartlesshealer> because baby die
[1:15:09] <$lotharrio> Heh, his tummy looks like a sack from behind.
[1:15:09] <rosemon5001> may the scaleless be blessed
[1:15:09] <PanicSwytch> TWIST HIS DICK
[1:15:12] <%valriot> Thats fucking dumb
[1:15:13] <+Order_of_Mystery> Well, what is it?
[1:15:16] <+Jaysky> Bad Dragon uwu
[1:15:17] <%W1nterTitan> Pat, you might be OP
[1:15:19] <TheArrow_> that spell is a bit much huh
[1:15:19] <%deviljhojho_> dick twist thursday already?
[1:15:19] <SomeOtherNeb> @PatStaresAt if you try to melee him in his first phase, he actively tries to avoid you to protect Ocelotte
[1:15:21] <Wan6Saber> boss
[1:15:21] <j0ustar> 2 ez
[1:15:22] <%Aydarkzero> are you pro yet?
[1:15:23] <derap41> So this balance is fucked
[1:15:24] <jhonxiolonn> people in the discord complaining about bosses and pat is just destroying everything
[1:15:26] <Shishi1205> Any new items in here?
[1:15:26] <katocrimson> gundyer part 2
[1:15:28] <%realm_forge> WOW....
[1:15:30] <olm46> @lotharrio Ocelotte is an mpreg baby.
[1:15:32] <+OhioNitsud> This is so op LUL
[1:15:34] <fuji_92> gg
[1:15:34] <%Pilzkun> how is pat so stronk lol
[1:15:35] <Dino_from_YoAssThiccPark> pat is now the dark souls boss
[1:15:42] <jdanov> balance isn't fucked, Pat's levels are
[1:15:45] <nepwar> who knew being a boss character could be so fun
[1:15:49] <%deviljhojho_> @Pilzkun he did a bit of level grinding off stream
[1:15:50] <%YakumoYomi> @jhonxiolonn They're probably not as overleveled as he is
[1:15:51] <%realm_forge> Voldemort‚Äôs a bitch compared to this build
[1:15:54] <%Coystick> Why is Pat over leveled every time he play Dark Souls 3 ?
[1:15:54] <xWanderingFlame> Is this Devil may cry 2?
[1:15:58] <+Order_of_Mystery> Oceiros learned how to lay eggs, and that's where Ocelotte came from
[1:16:01] <%Pilzkun> @deviljhojho_ ahhhhhh that'd do it lol
[1:16:07] <davey0000> Hey Pat, know you've been on a Runeterra kick and was wondering if you've heard the new that one of the new champs for main League looks to be a straight up Dante rip off with stolen Style Meter font and everything
[1:16:09] <cureneckbeard> Six Dark Dances, more than enough to kill anything that moves
[1:16:13] <%MrBorisMakarov> MAKE NUMBER GO UP
[1:16:16] <Snake1300> All hail lord Elmo
[1:16:16] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @jhonxiolonn Complaining about what? That they're too difficult?
[1:16:18] <+Jaysky> What is? That boss?
[1:16:18] <+chaggles> you past a chest
[1:16:18] <%RVMSpeedWagon> becoming huge is a way of life
[1:16:19] <derap41> Hey at least you get to role play an actual arc mage just fucking everythign over
[1:16:23] <%xRichEvo> Ello boys n girls
[1:16:27] <Ookamiden02> cool
[1:16:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeyeye Bird man
[1:16:28] <+AbnormalVoid> That's so Raven
[1:16:29] <Shishi1205> Bloodborne
[1:16:30] <%Ner234> Neat
[1:16:30] <katocrimson> plague doctor
[1:16:30] <BallerSwagBro9k> BIRD UP
[1:16:32] <+Order_of_Mystery> oh that's awesome
[1:16:33] <%sniffy77> Doesn't oceiros kill his baby
[1:16:33] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> This part was always awesome. Still dunno how it works, but what else is new with this series.
[1:16:33] <cureneckbeard> Vulcan Raven...?
[1:16:33] <%cowardman93> it's Eileen's hat
[1:16:34] <%xcompleasedad> So, what happens when he has to fight Abyss enemies with Dark Resist?
[1:16:34] <nepwar> that eien?
[1:16:35] <%ItsCaptainDisco> BIRD UP
[1:16:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> I like my women like I like my coffee
[1:16:38] <%Coystick> Big hat is also a raven mask
[1:16:40] <rosemon5001> KAAAW
[1:16:40] <+wydamn> @AbnormalVoid LUL
[1:16:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> Big fuckin titties
[1:16:41] <Arisato_II> Fits our current times
[1:16:46] <cureneckbeard> Ravens... there are a lot of ravens here.
[1:17:00] <+Jaysky> OOOOOH this part
[1:17:02] <JetpackMcQuack> Made my brain hurt
[1:17:03] <+Order_of_Mystery> deep, dank dark
[1:17:05] <jhonxiolonn> there's people who don't know this exists
[1:17:06] <Zombrocom> An... AGE of dark even
[1:17:07] <BallerSwagBro9k> I still dont get why its here
[1:17:08] <derap41> Also where the fuck are we in space and time right now?
[1:17:11] <+Jaysky> Yeah I thought I was entering the final area when I found this place
[1:17:12] <Zaku_III> I got here and was just like 'What in the HELL is happening? WHy is this...WHAT'
[1:17:13] <%riantDeliration> Finding this on accident was my favorite part of DS3 hands down
[1:17:16] <lemonadeicecold> nylumeA jazz18Litty
[1:17:33] <%Mendin> fear not the Dark, my friends, and let the feast begin
[1:17:33] <derap41> People bitch about the Iron Keep in DS2 but this is just as bad
[1:17:37] <Shishi1205> Any cool magic oceiros might give for his soul? @PatStaresAt
[1:17:40] <+Jaysky> I was confused at first
[1:17:41] <%Broand> Physically speaking, it's in the actual spot where the regular graveyard is
[1:17:41] <j0ustar> casual timetravel
[1:17:42] <nepwar> or back in the future
[1:17:48] <+Order_of_Mystery> time is convoluted and all that other bullshit
[1:17:48] <candidateplays> It's not back in time
[1:17:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> and it as all slapdash at the last second! this area was going to be the final boss zone and have the Eclipse and you'd fight Sullivan but he'd be "The Old King of the Black Eclipse"
[1:17:58] <Zombrocom> Why? Because it;s cool. No other reason.
[1:17:59] <jimmytwofeet> YOU'RE CONVOLU-oh
[1:18:00] <%Taisuru> It's forward back in time
[1:18:00] <%Coystick> The way they refer to the Dark with a capital D is classy
[1:18:03] <+pectusumbra> your dick is convoluted
[1:18:04] <SomeOtherNeb> it is back in time, the soul trade lord says so IIRC
[1:18:06] <%heartlesshealer> Isn't it a remains of a previous cycle????
[1:18:06] <Djinnazz> FORWARD in time
[1:18:08] <SaltyAzteca> *screams unintelligently*
[1:18:08] <%M4T1A5> but isn't it forward
[1:18:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> ITS THE FUTURE PAT
[1:18:11] <Zombrocom> It is EXPLICITLY back in time
[1:18:12] <fuji_92> is it tho?
[1:18:12] <%linSP> So is the other bonfire just a hunters dream
[1:18:16] <%chambatron> You ar ein the future
[1:18:16] <Cymen90> She recognized you from the past
[1:18:17] <%Taisuru> It's both
[1:18:17] <Shishi1205> Back in time
[1:18:18] <Innocuous_Goat> This is Ludleth's Firelink
[1:18:20] <%heartlesshealer> neat
[1:18:23] <+Jaysky> Are we undoing the future that is Aku?
[1:18:25] <%RVMSpeedWagon> it is not the future it is the past pat is correct
[1:18:28] <%Lizard0TM> it is back in time, but it's also a physically different place
[1:18:33] <derap41> So why is shit dark?
[1:18:33] <%dashdodger> well then why isn't gundyr dead in the future
[1:18:35] <DuoScratch> It's been super proven that this IS the past guys, a past age of dark.
[1:18:38] <candidateplays> That means that Firelink is in the future, not that this is the past
[1:18:39] <fuji_92> BUT IS IT THO?
[1:18:41] <Shishi1205> No bonfire so dark
[1:18:41] <%chambatron> Ohh then I'm wrong I didn't know this
[1:18:47] <%RVMSpeedWagon> its also why gundyr has a soul here and not at the begining of the game
[1:18:48] <%FacetiousAF> oh god this gundyr is gonna be even worse, huh
[1:18:52] <%cowardman93> he is dead in the future, the corruption puppets his body
[1:18:53] <Shishi1205> puppers
[1:18:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I saw an interesting theory that Firelink and the Cemetary of Ash is actually in the future, and Untended Graves is the area in the current time along with the rest of the game
[1:19:00] <Ciglossonjr> It‚Äôs not forward or back in time. It‚Äôs an area that lost all meaning when From reshuffled everything for the 50th time
[1:19:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> and Ludleth was the one who linked the fire in this era right?
[1:19:01] <+AbnormalVoid> Black Sabbath
[1:19:01] <$Dakuu75> so, this is what the world is like when the age of fire ends?
[1:19:02] <derap41> Darrk Dogs
[1:19:02] <Arisato_II> Wow wow hold on
[1:19:07] <aubrea> pat is op nothing is gonna be hard
[1:19:07] <$lotharrio> @derap41 I guess the Lords of Cinder coming back created some lingering light for the world.
[1:19:12] <Arisato_II> Then who the hell is the one in the coffin if not you during this time?
[1:19:12] <+pectusumbra> Man if we get League of Legends Featuring Dante from Devil May Cry I might not stop laughing
[1:19:15] <wrinklemydinkle> gundyr (peak form) is a chad don't @ me
[1:19:20] <+wydamn> Get ready for Gundyr with Slave Knight Gael's moveset in the 4th phase.
[1:19:22] <%M4T1A5> Has Pat done any dlc in this run yet
[1:19:26] <Djinnazz> @dakuu75 if no one lights the fire, yes
[1:19:27] <nepwar> so the end of fire is just the same but with low contrast
[1:19:31] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:19:32] <+AbnormalVoid> vine
[1:19:34] <+AbnormalVoid> vineSanic
[1:19:37] <davey0000> Bro did you see that gif? That's straight up the style font from DMC @pectusumbra
[1:19:40] <%Coystick> But Bat if you kill Gundyr in the bast then you'll never be porn!
[1:19:46] <candidateplays> The Hidden Blessing is explicit that this is just the graveyard below the castle, fallen to darkness. It's not the future, not the past, not some alternate timeline. It's just a graveyard. Like the Hunter's Workshop is just a hunter's workshop
[1:19:47] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Shit like this & Gaunter O'Dimms weirdo puzzle realm in Witcher 3 are some of my faves
[1:19:47] <$Dakuu75> @Djinnazz gotchya
[1:19:48] <$lotharrio> @Arisato_II Simple. At this point in time, you're still in the coffin.
[1:19:56] <Shishi1205> they stop being threatening fairly quick
[1:20:06] <%heartlesshealer> Runeterra ripping off DMC or is it base League doing it?
[1:20:07] <%cylish> Guys he's already beaten the game legit plenty of times and on camera, who cares what his level is, just enjoy all the neat shit in cinders.
[1:20:09] <+pectusumbra> yeah it's pretty close
[1:20:10] <candidateplays> Firelink shrine is the mytery, just like the Hunter's ddream is the weird thing
[1:20:14] <%Taisuru> Let's get down to business
[1:20:15] <nepwar> so what happens if you touch yourself in this timeline? do you meld like timecop?
[1:20:21] <+Kingtut9009> Man watching this is just making me miss being able to go full mage in most Souls games
[1:20:29] <Shishi1205> Cooler gundyr
[1:20:32] <Arisato_II> That's it, I'm dialing Vaati as we speak
[1:20:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> No fuck Vaati
[1:20:41] <%mckraven> its terrifying
[1:20:41] <%Das_Bass> you mean "CANT SEE"
[1:20:42] <$dalmek> it's like space, but worse
[1:20:43] <+Jaysky> It's why I loved fighting the 4 Kings
[1:20:44] <+pectusumbra> The void
[1:20:44] <TomFrank> we kinda have that irl
[1:20:44] <SoySocks> it's why 4 Kings is my fave DS1 boss fight
[1:20:46] <+Order_of_Mystery> @Kingtut9009 you can go full mage in Cinders, and it's awesome :D
[1:20:47] <+wydamn> That's not just black, it's Vantablack
[1:20:48] <jhonxiolonn> then from where comes the light?
[1:20:48] <+D00msDayDan> or night time in space
[1:20:49] <davey0000> Not only that but the description is so on point "Stylish new combos with blades and bullets"
[1:20:51] <Zaku_III> Think Lothric Castle is over there but you just can't see it?
[1:20:55] <%Coystick> Night time, the final frontier
[1:20:58] <Personified134> This exists in the same universe as Drangleic Castle from the DS2 LP, The Land of Broken Skybox
[1:20:58] <Ciglossonjr> I‚Äôm calling fucking Sinclair Lore
[1:20:58] <%Mendin> don't show Paige the infinity
[1:20:59] <derap41> Its llone How much more black could it be
[1:20:59] <%ItsCaptainDisco> It really reminds you of your real enemy in this game
[1:21:01] <+kapcommunist> pats biggest fear. almost being indoors, but not
[1:21:03] <Djinnazz> That‚Äôs the Ocean for me
[1:21:03] <+worldbrand> are you well man
[1:21:05] <%FusRoDom> This looks like a dev room they chose to turn into a zone
[1:21:08] <%Aydarkzero> this is Darkness within Darkness
[1:21:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> Vaati is hot garbage. Vaati pushed the Solaire=Firstborn theory when the whole point of Solaire is he's cool because he's a nobody and a loser
[1:21:11] <derap41> None None morre black
[1:21:12] <%Taisuru> Is THIS ANor Londo psaLiz
[1:21:14] <+Order_of_Mystery> the abyss is one of the cooler areas in dark souls 1 and 3.
[1:21:17] <%patriotrenegade> look at him masticate\
[1:21:21] <%mckraven> my question is if there's no light or sky why are you able to see
[1:21:22] <%cylish> 4 kings always makes me think of that secret super mario RPG boss
[1:21:28] <TheDarkRemRem99> does anyone know if this mod covers dlc as well?
[1:21:28] <candidateplays> ...you cna literally see it, Pat
[1:21:32] <Shishi1205> Damn thats some hate for Vaati
[1:21:34] <candidateplays> It's right there
[1:21:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> but this isnt the AGE OF DARK right? there never has been an age of dark before?
[1:21:39] <TheArrow_> yeah this mod changes the dlc too
[1:21:39] <KoyaMusa> well my issue with vaati was the whole not crediting people properly
[1:21:39] <RogueKnightXIII> Ever gone out to the sea out in a cloudy night, same energy
[1:21:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @TheDarkRemRem99 It does indeed
[1:21:40] <olm46> Why is everything perfectly visible amidst pure darkness?
[1:21:42] <%heartlesshealer> bye Pat eyes
[1:21:44] <%chambatron> So if this is the past is it before ds1 and ds2?
[1:21:44] <%patriotrenegade> BIG DAMAGE
[1:21:54] <stardustcrusad3r> this gaem stinky dreamt12Angry dreamt12Angry FrankerZ
[1:21:56] <%StaceMcGate> Age of Dark seems like a shitty ass time, how is this the time of humans?
[1:21:58] <Zombrocom> The world goes through cycles of dark and fire
[1:21:59] <davey0000> @LiquidDinosaur let's not forget Plague sorta also pushed that with his story video
[1:22:01] <%sniffy77> i wonder if this was a easy area to make for the devs.
[1:22:01] <%Taisuru> @chambatron It's for sure after DS1
[1:22:10] <%Maids4lyfe> For an Age of Dark it sure is pretty well-lit
[1:22:11] <Shishi1205> Humans are shitty @StaceMcGate
[1:22:12] <%cowardman93> it's between DS2 and DS3
[1:22:13] <aubrea> dont think about it
[1:22:13] <@BigNaturalMan59> this part of the game and the very end are some of the most anxious ive felt playing vidya
[1:22:15] <%Aydarkzero> @chambatron not that far back just an unspecified age of dark that happened
[1:22:18] <nepwar> it would be really unsettling if falling down here didn't pop up the you died sign and it just had you falling and slowly fading to black
[1:22:22] <%Taisuru> @chambatron Due to you going into the firelink and it being closest to DS3
[1:22:23] <%chambatron> Thanks peeps
[1:22:27] <Zombrocom> Ludleth says he willed himself Lord of Cinder to end the Age of Dark
[1:22:29] <TheDarkRemRem99> thats dope i figured it mightve only been main game
[1:22:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @davey0000 unlike Vaati i like Plague so i purposely forget that. But also its really Vaati's fault IMO. Plague was making a cartoon not creating the lore
[1:22:33] <%Broand> If you go up from the place you spawned in in the regular firelink, you get to the bit before oceiros
[1:22:36] <+ATorL> Lothric probably isn't even there in lore either since the whole "lands converging" thing is because in DS3 the perpetuation of the cycle for so long is what caused that. But then again DS's idea of time never followed any rules so maybe fuck me.
[1:22:37] <Shishi1205> What is the lore of that dude
[1:22:40] <+wydamn> @chambatron not likely. Gwynn linked the first flame, and your character from DS1 was the second to link it. This is after multiple linkings.
[1:22:42] <%YakumoYomi> @StaceMcGate I guess because the gods and dragons are gone, so it's the "Human Age" by default?
[1:22:43] <+skylerpilot> @chambatron its the past relative to the rest of DS3
[1:22:43] <%xcompleasedad> What level is Pat?
[1:22:45] <davey0000> no music
[1:22:45] <Shishi1205> Youre fucked

[1:22:51] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt isnt the black knight shield a straight upgrade from that shield?
[1:22:53] <%Aydarkzero> poor Gundyr couldn't find a Waifu
[1:22:56] <+Jaysky> Resistant to dark it seems
[1:22:59] <RVMSpeedWagon> LMFAO "oh shit"

[1:23:03] <+ianabstract> "Get that nerd shit outta here"
[1:23:03] <davey0000> Silent boss fights are underrated
[1:23:05] <Shishi1205> Everybody was kung fu fighting
[1:23:05] <%heartlesshealer> Perhaps a faster spell?
[1:23:07] <THELava_lad> Music???
[1:23:09] <%weissguard> @davey0000 Let's not forget that Plague was explicitly joking around when he used it for the sake of the joke, acknowledging it as fan canon.
[1:23:09] <$Dakuu75> god damn, the tracking on this guy
[1:23:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> UH HO NO MUSIC
[1:23:12] <%Crimpson> The beacons are lit! Gundry calls for aid!

[1:23:14] <%RVMSpeedWagon> PARRY HIS ASS
[1:23:14] <%cylish> He came here to fight the dark, you think he did so unprepared pat?
[1:23:15] <Jontman42> it's a bug
[1:23:16] <%StaceMcGate> @YakumoYomi so because everyone else is dead and the world sucks ass, its the humans time to rise?
[1:23:17] <derap41> Its nice seeing Gundyr not being a total bitch

[1:24:05] <%sniffy77> Pat ur magic cheese is making your sword wheeze
[1:24:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> Did he normally do that?
[1:24:10] <fuji_92> gundyr kicks and his shoulder check are DOPE
[1:24:13] <davey0000> Some boss fights just work better without music man
[1:24:13] <Shishi1205> You need more HP
[1:24:16] <%DakotaMacDoodle> PRO TIP: Shoot it till it dies
[1:24:17] <%Das_Bass> someones fucked
[1:24:17] <Innocuous_Goat> Gundyr out here running a quality build
[1:24:21] <%Mendin> yeah he did that in the original

[1:24:39] <%Broand> WHy are you still embered
[1:24:39] <%Lizard0TM> Pat just parry him, hes the most parriable boss in the game
[1:24:40] <SomeOtherNeb> no, because Cinders
[1:24:42] <KorysHere> you ever try the dash ring cheese? you can use items while sprinting
[1:24:46] <TheArrow_> yeah they up the fuck out of the aggro for enemies
[1:25:00] <%Maids4lyfe> @Broand he used an ember when he respawned
[1:25:02] <AlphaTauri> I go in and it spawns Soul AND 10 waves of trial enemies
[1:25:02] <Arisato_II> lol someone diesd
[1:25:02] <%RVMSpeedWagon> get in there and parry him you dork lord LUL
[1:25:03] <TheArrow_> they made him harder to parry

[1:25:06] <SaltyAzteca> Oh there's the msic
[1:25:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Weird
[1:25:20] <%Broand> That was always there
[1:25:21] <%TrollKing96> If the Age of Dark is also the Age of Man, how can Humans live with all of the shit the Dark brings out?
[1:25:23] <%Broand> even in vanilla
[1:25:28] <+Order_of_Mystery> Gundyr had time to wake his choir back up
[1:25:28] <%Mendin> same thing
[1:25:29] <SaltyAzteca> Yooo a black knight fought Gundyr? PogChamp
[1:25:32] <Saltmeisterr> BootiPls
[1:25:37] <Shishi1205> The humans are of dark origin
[1:25:39] <%YakumoYomi> @RVMSpeedWagon They made him harder to parry in Cinders, I hear
[1:25:39] <jhonxiolonn> nice moves pat
[1:25:40] <%dekkitout> Twist his dick!
[1:25:48] <+skylerpilot> @TrollKing96 Humans came from the dark
[1:25:50] <BliVru> @TrollKing96 They get gud
[1:25:51] <%Lizard0TM> parry him!
[1:25:53] <%RVMSpeedWagon> @YakumoYomi really? dang lol
[1:25:55] <%Maids4lyfe> @TrollKing96 because all that shit is Humanity
[1:26:07] <DesertPenguin> Anyone also checking out the Rooster Teeth podcast right now?
[1:26:07] <olm46> Pus makes him so much less cool.
[1:26:09] <$renyrells> WOOO
[1:26:12] <jhonxiolonn> let's go PAT
[1:26:15] <Scrub_Seeker> ???
[1:26:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> AngelThump
[1:26:20] <%Maids4lyfe> you think people are supposed to look like people? no our true forms in Dark Souls are giant monsters
[1:26:20] <+Order_of_Mystery> I hate how Gundyr's boots have metal toes modeled on them
[1:26:22] <Saltmeisterr> wait so was there a second gundyr fight in og DS3?
[1:26:22] <Shishi1205> He is pretty bloodborny in this phase
[1:26:22] <%ItsCaptainDisco> This is why Pus of Man is garbage
[1:26:26] <cureneckbeard> dark lives matter
[1:26:28] <Innocuous_Goat> Humans as they are in the age of light aren't the same as they were initially. Something about taking a fleeting form and whatnot
[1:26:30] <%RVMSpeedWagon> the peoples champion with the flying kick from the top rope!
[1:26:30] <%heartlesshealer> multi-hit charge stab
[1:26:31] <Shishi1205> Yes @Saltmeisterr
[1:26:38] <%Lizard0TM> you can
[1:26:40] <%linSP> he do a step
[1:26:42] <%dekkitout> His moveset is so cool
[1:26:46] <%weissguard> That's a nice stomp.
[1:26:48] <boomstickery> with the glaive you picked up?
[1:26:48] <Ultimatefool> Your character isn't cool enough
[1:26:48] <+Kingtut9009> I once did a cosplay Gundyr build, was pretty fun
[1:26:49] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt cinders lets you do his kick with fist weapons equipped
[1:26:52] <Zombrocom> You can get one move from his halbred, but not the cool shoulder check or the leaping slam
[1:26:54] <davey0000> @TrollKing96 they don't, that's kinda part of the point. End the cycle of lies to possibly fuck things up or keep the cycle going for no real reason than maybe thing might get bad
[1:26:55] <+Jaysky> Paunch, shoulder, speen, stab, woosh
[1:26:59] <+Jaysky> KEEK
[1:27:00] <%deviljhojho_> THAT KICK

[1:27:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:27:18] <%Mendin> DA CHAMPEEN
[1:27:18] <Sogeki_Dan> All he needs is a grapple or two
[1:27:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> I beat this guy in 2 tries and the first one was like an exploraory "im not even trying i just wanting to see his moveset" run. And then i didnt touch the game for 2 weeks. Came back ran straight to him and 1-shot him
[1:27:20] <KoyaMusa> pat hasn't had to melee anything really in a while
[1:27:21] <Ultimatefool> This man is ANTI - StinkyCheese
[1:27:25] <cahv123> This is a boss whose turned his world into a fighting game. Woolie would or has loved this.
[1:27:26] <JetpackMcQuack> It's a Soul calibur character
[1:27:28] <DesertPenguin> awful
[1:27:29] <+skylerpilot> launcher into big boot is so sick
[1:27:29] <AxelCezar> champion the abyss boys and pontiff are the best bosses
[1:27:32] <TheArrow_> has pat done archdragon peak yet?
[1:27:32] <+ATorL> Dude in Armor fights in Dark Souls have always been the best ones.
[1:27:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah he got mega buffed
[1:27:35] <%YakumoYomi> If you want revised movesets, then keep an eye on the Champion's Ashes mod. The next update is adding functioning trick weapons from Bloodborne
[1:27:36] <jhonxiolonn> Lmao
[1:27:37] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:27:37] <%Crimpson> air combo

[1:27:41] <jhonxiolonn> Monster hunter hitboxes
[1:27:44] <%Pilzkun> hitbox behind him
[1:27:44] <+Jaysky> In my first fight with this guy I got him to about 4% of his health, then when I went back I kept getting wrecked.
[1:27:44] <Arisato_II> WHERE'S YOUR MAGIC NOW, LIL BITCH?
[1:27:44] <BliVru> Do a kick with a halberd
[1:27:45] <Ransom73> atpMurray
[1:27:46] <jimmytwofeet> G G FIRST TRY
[1:27:46] <%MakotoPB> the shockwave from the strike was too powerful
[1:27:46] <transporterthesequel> I like how there is virtually no changes to him
[1:27:47] <SilverFaustX> lobosDied
[1:27:47] <Wan6Saber> junkersREKT lol gtfo
[1:27:48] <+OhioNitsud> put Gundyr in SC6

[1:27:48] <%Lizard0TM> Pat, ya gotta parry that casul
[1:27:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> he's got NO GIMMICKS. He's just a big boy with a big knife and his big fist and his big foot
[1:27:49] <%Pilzkun> 10/10 hitboxes
[1:27:50] <Jontman42> fighting him with quickstep is cool as heck
[1:27:51] <%weissguard> This is a good one.
[1:27:52] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> he thicc
[1:27:54] <%Ner234> Dark Magic THIS you casual

[1:27:54] <$startadevy> you're going gainst an AI computer
[1:27:54] <Zombrocom> Don't try to parry him, his parry frames have been fucked up
[1:27:56] <nepwar> gundyr got some BEEF
[1:27:56] <glass_marcus> character action juggles
[1:27:57] <@BigNaturalMan59> thebetTry
[1:27:58] <buffaloaf13> he's one grab away from being zangeif
[1:27:58] <$startadevy> hav we not discussed this
[1:27:59] <derap41> Gundyr is always boss
[1:27:59] <wrinklemydinkle> LUL
[1:27:59] <davey0000> The Champ is so underrated in terms of DS3 bosses
[1:28:02] <fuji_92> yeah, with timing hes trivial cause parries
[1:28:05] <$renyrells> "i love a boss that can kick my ass"
[1:28:08] <+demon1103> so remember when we said how OP Pat was...Gundyr don't give a crap XD
[1:28:09] <xWanderingFlame> devilnGasm devilnGasm devilnGasm
[1:28:10] <davey0000> Nameless seems to get all the credit
[1:28:13] <+skylerpilot> just parry him pat!
[1:28:15] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Alright, I'm gonna go & show my GF Attack the Block for the first time, I'll be back later! Hope you have fun, Pat
[1:28:21] <Djinnazz> Pat: 0 Mike Tyson: 2
[1:28:28] <Shishi1205> Yeah gundyr is prett cool as a fight
[1:28:29] <%RVMSpeedWagon> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:28:29] <Zombrocom> Nah, he just has a shitton of health
[1:28:30] <Wan6Saber> best gasm emote sofiSmug
[1:28:35] <%Broand> I beat him so easily that I hardly had time to appreciate it
[1:28:37] <+Jaysky> Wouldn't call him underrated. Nameless is cool but his dragon fight is camera jank
[1:28:43] <davey0000> True
[1:28:44] <Shishi1205> I mean they give you the poison using summon for a reason (bleed too)
[1:28:45] <sylvainsilver> Well time to kill a champion with the herald of sunlight
[1:28:48] <Arisato_II> Name 1 character that doesn't fucks it up in the entire series
[1:28:48] <nepwar> its prob because he put all his points to luck
[1:28:50] <Ultimatefool> Well this mod just buffed everyone's health, especially the bosses
[1:28:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> I never beat Nameless because fuck having to fight the Dragon every time
[1:28:53] <%heartlesshealer> you were dealing 777 damage with your slow big sword magic earlier
[1:28:56] <Zombrocom> Friede was super easy for my dark mage
[1:28:59] <transporterthesequel> Actually it‚Äôs explicitly his fault
[1:29:01] <derap41> I mean you're doing good damage
[1:29:02] <+skylerpilot> frayed >.>
[1:29:03] <%Mitchellsocks> "fraid"? do you mean Friede?
[1:29:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Honestly not really. Friede was squishy to me
[1:29:03] <Zombrocom> Midir was the thing
[1:29:05] <Lophostrix_> WHO THE FUCK IS FREID
[1:29:06] <%YakumoYomi> I didn't have problems with her, because Dark Dance staggers the fuck outta her
[1:29:10] <%RVMSpeedWagon> did pat call Sister Friede "fryed"
[1:29:10] <fuji_92> even artorias fucks it up, gundyr just followed his footsteps Kappa
[1:29:11] <KorysHere> pretty sure you can still stagger her still
[1:29:13] <deefykins> Ranged builds shit all over Friede
[1:29:19] <KoyFoster> OG Friend or modded Frey? Cause OG does indeed have a lot of HP.
[1:29:24] <$startadevy> pat is king of parry\
[1:29:30] <+Jaysky> I fucking hated Friede
[1:29:31] <TheArrow_> friede was way easier for me in this mod than in vanilla
[1:29:31] <davey0000> But when you ask someone what are THE boss fights of DS3 Nameless and Gael seem to come up a lot when Gundyr really deserves a spot
[1:29:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> that kick is so funny looking
[1:29:37] <Shishi1205> Midir or Gael who has more health?
[1:29:39] <derap41> Well it does str scake
[1:29:45] <davey0000> Not to say that Nameless and Gael aren't the coolest because holy shit
[1:29:46] <Zombrocom> Two handing boosts strength, your a mage dude
[1:29:47] <cosmicdischarge> midir
[1:29:49] <%Taisuru> Two handing just multiplies your Strenght doesn't it?
[1:29:50] <%RVMSpeedWagon> lmao get bodied
[1:29:58] <+Jaysky> Gael is my favorite of the series
[1:30:03] <wrinklemydinkle> THE PUNISH
[1:30:03] <%Lizard0TM> secret to this boss is to parry him Pat
[1:30:04] <jhonxiolonn> throw some fireballs!
[1:30:05] <+Invlux> why one hand if you aren't going to block
[1:30:07] <derap41> @Taisuru adds 50% str in vanilla
[1:30:09] <+Jaysky> The setting for the fight can't be topped
[1:30:15] <Zombrocom> @Lizard0TM Not in the mod, they nerfed his parry frames
[1:30:19] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> @Lizard0TM the mod made him much harder to parry
[1:30:20] <%heartlesshealer> Gundyr's great
[1:30:25] <%Crimpson> Gundyr for next smash character plz
[1:30:28] <+Jaysky> Two nobodies fighting over a soul
[1:30:33] <Scrub_Seeker> @Ragnvaldr_AGH but you still can parry him
[1:30:39] <+Jaysky> In a pit of ash
[1:30:39] <%YakumoYomi> I'd say Gael or Gundyr. Nameless is fine, but the first phase of the fight is pretty underwhelming
[1:30:40] <Shishi1205> On the Boss versus videos this dude almost never loses
[1:30:42] <Wan6Saber> get bodied, bro!
[1:30:46] <Keniefer> Be good streamer >:( *farts*
[1:30:47] <davey0000> Gael takes it in terms of Theatrics but for a Big Armor 1 Phase fight Gundyr is so fucking great
[1:30:50] <derap41> So just keeps comming
[1:30:51] <jhonxiolonn> USE SOME SPELLS
[1:30:51] <%Lizard0TM> @ragnvaldr_agh not really, fought him a few days ago
[1:30:53] <KoyaMusa> honestly i wonder if pat should pick up great magic shield
[1:30:59] <%Lizard0TM> just as essy
[1:31:02] <arkv01> BIG BOI dodges
[1:31:09] <%Lizard0TM> easy
[1:31:14] <+Jaysky> HE'S GUNNING UP
[1:31:24] <%heartlesshealer> Maybe try fighting him with your quickstep stuff on, since you're not using magic? :0c
[1:31:24] <+JingKaisean> can you shield the stomp?
[1:31:25] <%Taisuru> COMBOS
[1:31:25] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> hm, alright then.
[1:31:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Artorias wannabe kinamaSmug
[1:31:27] <fuji_92> GUNDYR UP

[1:31:52] <wrinklemydinkle> psaSkelmo
[1:31:52] <%Lizard0TM> SSS for Gundyr
[1:31:54] <davey0000> If his Glaive had that moveset you'd probably see it a lot more because HOLY SHIT
[1:31:58] <JetpackMcQuack> Set aggression to 11
[1:31:59] <MultipleJiggs> Look at these Tekken combos
[1:31:59] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Pat remember you can infuse your shield!
[1:32:01] <%FacetiousAF> Kappa call solaire
[1:32:02] <marsghoul> the run to the boss gives me nightmares
[1:32:07] <$Afterman_> hesitation is defeat
[1:32:09] <notquitedead123> That's a big hat
[1:32:09] <fuji_92> PUT GUNDYR INTO SOUL CALIBUR
[1:32:09] <@BigNaturalMan59> gundyr is almost as cool as ffxi
[1:32:10] <+TopTieramisu> launch punished
[1:32:13] <jimmytwofeet> Is the bloodborne Moonlight Greatsword in Cinders mod?

[1:32:44] <%heartlesshealer> Your slow magic is ass here
[1:32:52] <Shishi1205> Is better for your mobility
[1:32:55] <%Mendin> your probably want to climax for speed
[1:32:56] <%YakumoYomi> Takes too long to cast and costs a lot of FP. Dark Dance would be more efficient.

[1:34:08] <%Jekado> the what of the mushroom?
[1:34:08] <%dekkitout> Mushroom is fed
[1:34:09] <%heartlesshealer> Coffee is a diuretic
[1:34:09] <maxpasta> Drain those piss balls
[1:34:12] <+worldbrand> pee meter visualized
[1:34:13] <%YakumoYomi> I better see them pepperonis when you come back.
[1:34:13] <+Invlux> that's when you pinch it with your fingers
[1:34:14] <derap41> @SoFarFetched his mushroom
[1:34:15] <%heartlesshealer> because of the caffeine
[1:34:16] <theanora1> pee is stored in the mushroom?
[1:34:21] <fuji_92> 88
[1:34:22] <Gallhint> do canadians have smaller bladders or something
[1:34:30] <%heartlesshealer> pee is stored in the mushroom gills
[1:34:30] <%JumboCrunchies> Yes
[1:34:31] <davey0000> I hope Pat thinks about going back to League when Dante gets added, maybe even Woolie will get in
[1:34:32] <%realm_forge> Pat once again sentenced to piss jail
[1:34:35] <TomFrank> pat is bursting at the seems with piss
[1:34:35] <stanlychicken> Pat does in fact probably have a penis
[1:34:36] <+Jaysky> Only some of us
[1:34:37] <cureneckbeard> canadians store pee in bags
[1:34:40] <Keniefer> Pee is stored within the kidneys and bladder :)
[1:34:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pee is stored in the Boletes
[1:34:48] <TheZearGuy> I hate that I know he takes his pants off lol
[1:34:57] <+worldbrand> We keep our pee in 2 liter bags
[1:34:57] <+Jaysky> Ah like milk @cureneckbeard
[1:34:57] <+Soulbishop> Yes a return to the suffering of one Pat Stares At
[1:34:58] <Gallhint> real talk, pee is stored inside your bones

[1:35:05] <fuji_92> pee stored in the bolas
[1:35:05] <%heartlesshealer> nah, caffeine (and also alcohol) aid in increasing the need to urinate
[1:35:09] <%Mendin> he has to drain the Boivan
[1:35:17] <derap41> Do you think Pat Tucks the Bottom of his shirt under his Chin when he Pees?
[1:35:21] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> We call our kidney and bladder system up here our "Stanley Cup". üá®üá¶
[1:35:25] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> i never realized that Mustard is an IV drip into peachSaliva's arm
[1:35:26] <%heartlesshealer> I forget the biological mechanics, but organs say "get this out now"
[1:35:26] <%realm_forge> Pat must squeeze the orb as it is too full
[1:35:28] <%RVMSpeedWagon> RVMSpeedWagon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! AYY Four months of supporting 1/2 of CSB lets get it team
[1:35:32] <+Soulbishop> Does it come out as gas?
[1:35:32] <Keniefer> I've heard that there is a muscle that you can train to hold bigger pees :)
[1:35:41] <%Run44forrest> pat doesnt take his pants off to pee does he?
[1:35:47] <cureneckbeard> castle super late
[1:35:56] <davey0000> It's a known fact that clear piss is more satisfying than normal piss
[1:36:11] <SomersaultJustice> don't forget to squeeze the balls to make sure you get all the pee Kappa
[1:36:16] <cureneckbeard> "90 seconds" you big liar
[1:36:20] <%realm_forge> @run44forrest he has to to squeeze the orb properly after he lays the tarp down
[1:36:23] <fuji_92> ^ SeemsGood
[1:36:25] <%deviljhojho_> Deciever.
[1:36:25] <%JumboCrunchies> @Run44forrest No, he drops his pants to his ankles and takes off his shirt.
[1:36:25] <+Invlux> I'm doing kegels every time Pat goes to intermission
[1:36:26] <Keniefer> I saw a kid pull down his pants to pee in elementary school. What parent would do that to a child? Mormons?
[1:36:30] <derap41> @Keniefer Also the Nerve that lets you feel that you need to be is more sensitive after you pee so if you pee will want to pee more readily
[1:36:32] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> pee is stored in the mushroom
[1:36:36] <%deviljhojho_> mormons dont pee
[1:36:38] <cureneckbeard> keniefer: feels good man
[1:36:41] <%Movemeister> 90s is just for taking his trousers off to release the orb flow
[1:36:43] <%deviljhojho_> They send that to the sky
[1:36:43] <%YakumoYomi> On a completely unrelated note: I like Bug Fables. If you like Paper Mario 64 or Thousand Year Door, you'll probably like Bug Fables
[1:36:51] <+Soulbishop> They sweat it out.
[1:36:54] <%heartlesshealer> welcome back from pee
[1:36:54] <%maenos2> Pat did you strip?
[1:36:58] <Sogeki_Dan> No pee, only CHeesing

[1:38:15] <%YakumoYomi> Not in Cinders. They changed his parry frames
[1:38:20] <fuji_92> hes not EZ to parry
[1:38:22] <Shishi1205> He is susceptible to parry but that is normal gundyr
[1:38:22] <%FacetiousAF> damn this mod is so good there's actually a benefit to upgrading the shield
[1:38:25] <%Aydarkzero> oh it's a weapon art shield
[1:38:26] <derap41> Good luck parrying a fuucking kick

[1:42:14] <Zombrocom> Dance the dark
[1:42:20] <%YakumoYomi> Don't really need Affinity when you have Dark Dance
[1:42:22] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt if you join the darkmoon covenant, the covenant itself gives you 1% mana recovered per second and you can buy a ring from it that does the same
[1:42:23] <bashful_bard> It's too efficient
[1:42:30] <%Bailey__gaming> Magic Fap Ring? that sounds like a new Autoblow model
[1:42:32] <fuji_92> YOU CAN DANCE IF YOU WANT TO

[1:42:35] <%RVMSpeedWagon> dreg tourment still nuts or did it reorked?
[1:42:48] <Zombrocom> I was a big fan of Mournful Flames during my runthrough as a dark mage as well
[1:42:53] <DesertPenguin> Oh my god Pat, when you're looking for something maybe go left to right in order instead of randomly circling around everything? It hurts my OCD, how do you do this?
[1:43:00] <%Lizard0TM> @PatStaresAt if you didn't know Writhing Deep is a spell you shoot onto the ground and after a couple seconds it exlpodes for a fuckton of damage
[1:43:12] <Shishi1205> he has tried it before lizard
[1:43:21] <jhonxiolonn> And let the feast begin
[1:43:24] <Zombrocom> He didn't like writhing deep
[1:43:26] <DesertPenguin> Good luck skeleton
[1:43:26] <%YakumoYomi> @Zombrocom Agreed. Mournful Flames was what I used for crowds, since the flames chase them.

[1:44:25] <DesertPenguin> Yea.....
[1:44:27] <%Maids4lyfe> the gods fucking suck
[1:44:28] <DesertPenguin> About that
[1:44:33] <KorysHere> they changed the old hag at Dreg Heap to dump more lore at you
[1:44:37] <derap41> FFlutted armor
[1:44:39] <%Taisuru> I love ringed city
[1:44:40] <DesertPenguin> And the answer is?
[1:44:44] <DesertPenguin> Did it? How?
[1:44:47] <%Aydarkzero> ONE GUY
[1:44:47] <%Coystick> Gwyn putting a collar on us, maaaan.
[1:44:49] <davey0000> It also answers what is the fight to outdo all others
[1:44:49] <Zombrocom> It's always Gywn's fault
[1:44:50] <%heartlesshealer> yup
[1:44:52] <%Das_Bass> psa1guy
[1:44:57] <DesertPenguin> Oh Gwyn's prison
[1:44:59] <Reckless_Rob> I mean at least it looks nice
[1:45:00] <%Starotter70> Good Job Gwynn
[1:45:03] <%heartlesshealer> Deities 101: gods are shit
[1:45:03] <Shishi1205> Gywn feared the power of humans
[1:45:04] <derap41> Fucking Gwyn couldn't stop fucking up
[1:45:06] <SomeOtherNeb> wait what
[1:45:07] <%Lizard0TM> Everything is Gwyns' fault
[1:45:09] <%FusRoDom> Does this mean that Dark Souls 1 is the first "cycle"?
[1:45:11] <%RVMSpeedWagon> it almost alwyas comes back to Gwynn being THE WORST
[1:45:13] <+Invlux> Dark Souls's ultimate deadbeat dad
[1:45:15] <%huskarl_zap> psaHoldon psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand_HF psaBig psaHoldon
[1:45:15] <classypigeon234> Gwyn bad Kaathe good
[1:45:15] <KorysHere> dark sign
[1:45:15] <DesertPenguin> So without him putting the Darksign on humanity we would just be normal peepull?
[1:45:17] <Keniefer> Nature of the curse is demon syphilis.
[1:45:20] <%Agami23> it also answered "what happens at the end of the age of dark" with two people fighting over the last of the dark soul
[1:45:22] <%realm_forge> Explain plz!
[1:45:23] <th3heromans> I thought it was Gwyndolyn's fault
[1:45:27] <DesertPenguin> Dark Soul
[1:45:34] <bashful_bard> I'm still salty gael was the final boss. He's cool, but a very boring character imo
[1:45:35] <%Mendin> "Oh Humans can use the Abyss and I kinda really dont like that. Let me just jam a little bit of fire in there so they need fire but they're also dark and oh it broke"
[1:45:38] <DesertPenguin> Where was that explained?
[1:45:42] <%Das_Bass> you leave my Gwyndolyn alone
[1:45:45] <davey0000> Gael is a big fight at the end of the world with a literal "Who?" with 3 phases and it couldn't be the fucking coolest
[1:45:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> it isnt explained well but that is the gist.
[1:45:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> That explains nothing LUL
[1:45:56] <%weissguard> To be fair To Gwyn:
[1:46:01] <KorysHere> gwyn was always a big dumby
[1:46:01] <%weissguard> He made Gwynevere.
[1:46:02] <DesertPenguin> This sounds like way more description then I remember anything in-game
[1:46:05] <derap41> @BallerSwagBro9k Welcome to Dark Souls
[1:46:07] <nepwar> theres the statue as well
[1:46:10] <%Das_Bass> Gwyndolyn's a good boy
[1:46:13] <Zombrocom> Malformed black armor of the Ringed Knights. The armor of early men was forged in the Abyss, and betrays a smidgen of life. For this reason the gods cast a seal of fire upon such armor, and those who possessed them.
[1:46:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> Gwyn was afraid of the potential of Humans, so he puts a power limiter on them that has the side effect of making people become undead
[1:46:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> @derap41 yup LUL
[1:46:16] <Innocuous_Goat> Gwyn just really hates dark people
[1:46:21] <DesertPenguin> Glad you still remember all this stuff. Good shit dude
[1:46:21] <Keniefer> TBH DS lore is a bit of a hodgepodge.
[1:46:22] <%YakumoYomi> @weissguard That's a solid point.
[1:46:25] <AlphaTauri> worth
[1:46:29] <Sunstalker> Gwyn lost his Van Halen mixtape though rooBooli

[1:47:40] <SomeOtherNeb> @DesertPenguin consider the two options and tell me you would prefer humanity
[1:47:40] <Zombrocom> Yep

[1:47:52] <DesertPenguin> I want half-dragon waifu
[1:47:56] <Scrub_Seeker> there's more of them but yes
[1:47:57] <DesertPenguin> GUess we're boned
[1:48:00] <jhonxiolonn> that guy wasn't there tho
[1:48:05] <%YakumoYomi> This is the best place in vanilla DS3 to farm for their gear
[1:48:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DesertPenguin i dont think its a "racism" thing its a "humans will become too powerful" thing
[1:48:06] <%Coystick> I wish Ringed City was the setting for the whole game, it's cooler than Lothric by a fat margin
[1:48:09] <davey0000> Was it Gwyn that felt really bad about that whole Dragon war or was it some other character I can't remember
[1:48:12] <th3heromans> now Pat, I know you killed 3 innocent lives, but its important to stay calm
[1:48:15] <DesertPenguin> @liquiddinosaur LUL
[1:48:16] <Shishi1205> his son
[1:48:21] <%Taisuru> @davey0000 Not Gwynn
[1:48:21] <derap41> In DS they where meant to wandering ghost but they made them not
[1:48:24] <Keniefer> I mean, magic is just a fancy gun. Are you guys saying soldiers are using cheese tactics?
[1:48:28] <%heartlesshealer> I think it was the Unnamed son
[1:48:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> @davey0000 His son felt bad and joined the Dragons
[1:48:32] <%Dapper_Cactuar> BURIAL SCYTHE
[1:48:38] <KoyaMusa> i wish lothric had more lore to it
[1:48:38] <Ciglossonjr> I wish Ringed City was fucking Londor
[1:48:39] <derap41> Its prettiest in the winter
[1:48:41] <DesertPenguin> If they had more of that area then maybe
[1:48:41] <buffaloaf13> psaFist
[1:48:44] <+Jaysky> Priscilla is a kind soul who can turn invisible AND has a fluffy tail
[1:48:44] <nepwar> i wish there was just a hint of a bloodborne area
[1:48:47] <davey0000> Oh yeah duh Nameless King in dragon land how'd I forget
[1:48:48] <Shishi1205> The ringed city is pretty fucking cool
[1:48:50] <DesertPenguin> Andor Londo
[1:48:59] <%DappercatEsquire> That's where they buried all the garmins
[1:49:07] <th3heromans> honestly there is no such thing as cheap tactics in a real life or death fight
[1:49:08] <Shishi1205> Mcdonals
[1:49:10] <%YakumoYomi> @Keniefer Of course. Just shout "1v1 me, bro!" at marines to really rile them up.
[1:49:14] <DesertPenguin> That's where they buried all the Garmin GPSs

[1:49:45] <+worldbrand> isnt there the ariandel painting too, or was there anything debunking that
[1:49:50] <davey0000> That and the fact that Paintings consist of alternate Universes so it could be theorized there will be a Bloodborne painting at some point
[1:49:51] <DesertPenguin> I don't know bloodborne so I'll trust you on that
[1:49:55] <%dovahkingprime> hey pat can you use Silence on Aldrich so we can see what happens

[2:00:35] <+SinisterBroccoli> @DesertPenguin it's kinda added cuz the armor is more utility in this mod rather than just fashion
[2:00:37] <+wellshuckit> Should of opened the chest in the futur then gone back to get chest again!!!!
[2:00:37] <Bluewolf544> The woolie hole
[2:00:42] <+chaggles> did you check inside the bottom of the tower

[2:02:43] <+Invlux> APATHY IS DEATH
[2:02:43] <Vashido22> HOLLOWS RISE UP
[2:02:45] <$startadevy> BLM
[2:02:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> nah its cool
[2:02:47] <DesertPenguin> It's the truth tho
[2:02:48] <%heartlesshealer> APATHY IS DEATH
[2:02:50] <Bluewolf544> But you get to be dry as a hollow @patstaresat
[2:02:50] <j0ustar> Life in the void
[2:02:50] <%Garthunox> better music now
[2:02:51] <Arisato_II> Hollow on hollow crime is null, so I see that as an absolute win
[2:02:52] <fuji_92> APATHY IS DEATH
[2:02:54] <+sindrantz> age of hollows is cool
[2:02:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> APATHY IS DEATH
[2:02:56] <+Archphronimos> I mean... Horror vs ?....
[2:02:57] <+Kitafin> APATHY IS DEATH
[2:02:59] <SGrim> Age of Hollows may be a horrible nightmare, but you get to be king!
[2:02:59] <+AbnormalVoid> Hollows is probably a big reset button, returning everything to the grey world that existed before fire
[2:02:59] <+Fnir> APATHY IS DEATH
[2:02:59] <%cylish> Age of dark at least seems to have some sort of structure involved with it
[2:03:00] <+Archphronimos> I'd pick the ?
[2:03:00] <arkv01> hollowed yes but immortal, are you in pat?
[2:03:02] <%heartlesshealer> I'm glad this is right after that part of the woolie KOTOR 2 streams
[2:03:05] <%Agami23> check right beside the dancers swords
[2:03:06] <+maynardftw> Yeah hollows are a dead end, spiritually and biologically speaking
[2:03:09] <+maynardftw> It's a bad ending
[2:03:10] <DesertPenguin> I thought Age of Dark was known to be shit too? Example: Chasm Of The Absys?
[2:03:12] <JaceDarkstar> apathy is death
[2:03:25] <nepwar> apapthy seems alright
[2:03:25] <DesertPenguin> DS1 DLC and all that
[2:03:26] <%emperordread> It's like in Naruto: Giving the mangekyou sharingan eyes and rinnegan eyes to Madara for an age of infinite peace Kappa
[2:03:28] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @PatStaresAt Yo, not sure if someone had asked you yet, but have you fully dropped off Destiny for good, or are you interested in what the next expansion reveal is next week?
[2:03:31] <%Clundy> But you see Pat, aPAThy is DEATH
[2:03:31] <Bluewolf544> Not only are you hollowed, you're also immortal and don't need a colostomy bag PogChamp
[2:03:33] <%Agami23> finally a game that lets you use them both together
[2:03:35] <davey0000> THE CHAMP
[2:03:37] <davey0000> HIS BELT
[2:03:38] <Jontman42> the end of fire ending properly resets the universe
[2:03:42] <Shishi1205> The chain is cool
[2:03:44] <+maynardftw> @PatStaresAt Is it?
[2:03:49] <arkv01> but you 'live' forever as a hollow
[2:03:49] <Bluewolf544> Get the champ set
[2:03:50] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[2:03:55] <DesertPenguin> Chain good
[2:03:55] <derap41> Reduces soul Absobtion=
[2:04:00] <Reckless_Rob> I forgot about everthing about this game
[2:04:01] <DesertPenguin> It's free real estate
[2:04:02] <Zombrocom> It's 15 levels
[2:04:02] <jhonxiolonn> the first time you played, you didn't thought the same
[2:04:05] <+maynardftw> Is the damage absorption not awful to lose?
[2:04:06] <RantingRavager> What? LESS DAMAGE?
[2:04:06] <Shishi1205> up
[2:04:09] <+SinisterBroccoli> Isn't chain just better Fap?
[2:04:10] <Reckless_Rob> @DesertPenguin LUL
[2:04:13] <Bluewolf544> its free real estate
[2:04:16] <aeonicvector> did you just skip out on the hands of god?
[2:04:17] <derap41> 10% XP cost is like nothing
[2:04:21] <jhonxiolonn> you don't need more damage, that's for sure
[2:04:24] <Jontman42> absorption's pretty important
[2:04:24] <%Taisuru> Don't give up goblin
[2:04:25] <Zombrocom> Chain is better or worse FAP depending on what stats you have
[2:04:29] <%heartlesshealer> your scrolling habits hurt
[2:04:29] <$startadevy> entertainitn
[2:04:31] <+Invlux> they really need some kind of sort feature
[2:04:33] <davey0000> 15 levels for 10%? How is that a bad deal at all
[2:04:34] <+Fooguwu> @derap41 it means damage absorption, not souls
[2:04:35] <Jodoxk1> Need more fingers
[2:04:39] <DesertPenguin> JUST GO LEFT TO RIGHT HOLY SHIT
[2:04:41] <%heartlesshealer> be strong, goblin
[2:04:42] <%heartlesshealer> THERE
[2:04:43] <Shishi1205> up
[2:04:43] <+maynardftw> @Jontman42 Yeah I was thinking defense in this game is actually viable
[2:04:46] <%Starotter70> psaBlind
[2:04:48] <Bluewolf544> fap the chain
[2:04:48] <%Aydarkzero> psaBlind
[2:04:49] <SGrim> You've missed it three time LUL
[2:04:57] <nepwar> too bad the ashen one only has four fingers and a stump
[2:05:07] <DesertPenguin> One at a time, left to right. This is so fucking cringey. You did this all the time in the DS3 LP
[2:05:12] <Zombrocom> Considering he dropped the clutch ring for it, he actually gains defense from this
[2:05:22] <DesertPenguin> OCD at risk
[2:05:22] <SomeOtherNeb> missing rings is cringe now? LUL
[2:05:23] <+maynardftw> @Zombrocom Oh! That makes sense. So if 5 is a big deal to those stats, then the stats are overall improved. But if you already have like 50 in all of them, 5 isn't as big a benefit.
[2:05:26] <Jontman42> the hp probably isn't worth it since you take more damage
[2:05:29] <+SinisterBroccoli> tf are you getting it on your finger
[2:05:30] <Bluewolf544> That mana bar holy fuck
[2:05:35] <Zombrocom> @maynardftw Yeah, exactly
[2:05:37] <%heartlesshealer> oh right, you opened the estus shard chest in the past first, so you only get one?
[2:05:38] <jhonxiolonn> less damage, more stats and def
[2:05:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> But who cares about defense if you just blow people up?
[2:05:45] <Shishi1205> Does the chain increase the dmg you take here too?
[2:05:49] <DesertPenguin> When you're looking for something do you systematically go through your stuff for it or do you frantically throw everything all over the place in the hopes you'll find the thing you need?
[2:05:56] <arkv01> just don't get hit
[2:05:56] <DesertPenguin> LUL
[2:05:58] <arkv01> learn flash step
[2:05:59] <jhonxiolonn> DO it, you're already Op

[2:06:50] <Bluewolf544> MIND AT RISK
[2:06:50] <%FacetiousAF> chesto
[2:06:53] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt What happens if you just use the Titanite Demon Body thing but not the head one
[2:06:54] <%heartlesshealer> he opened the chest in the past, so now he only gets one shard
[2:06:59] <%JumboCrunchies> PokPikachu

[2:07:04] <Djinnazz> Ok, back to work, see ya when I see ya @patstaresat
[2:07:05] <DesertPenguin> Can you respec as many times as you want in this mod or do you have to use the glitch?
[2:07:14] <Shishi1205> Was it that one?
[2:07:17] <%PaladinDupre> ANORAC
[2:07:20] <+worldbrand> sold ratslayer quiettCry
[2:07:22] <Bluewolf544> wait it works that way ??
[2:07:23] <davey0000> Isn't the past chest different from Current chest?
[2:07:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> NO PAT ITS NOT THE SAME
[2:07:25] <aeonicvector> arent all stats linear in cinder?
[2:07:29] <Jontman42> they still cost tongues tho
[2:07:32] <DesertPenguin> SWEET
[2:07:36] <+maynardftw> I would grind Abyss Watchers for a bit to get some more levels. They give you 50k each. You could grind Pontiff instead, but that's only more worthwhile if you can burn him down faster than the two stages of Abyss Watchers take to die. Which I can do with a bleed-dex build.
[2:07:37] <Shishi1205> I think the chests are different
[2:07:38] <KorysHere> there are no soft caps here
[2:07:39] <%Reveresao> Lvl 111 da fuck pat
[2:07:41] <Bluewolf544> BIG cheating
[2:07:41] <davey0000> Past chest is there in vanilla but different than current iirc
[2:07:45] <%trustycoyote> Had to step away for a few minutes, what was in the firelink shrine chest, chat?
[2:07:45] <%Broand> For cinders?
[2:07:46] <chidere> Pat fixed the AC! PogChamp
[2:07:49] <+Invlux> and the rest of the stats don't have one
[2:07:50] <%Lizard0TM> but there are no caps in Cinders?
[2:07:54] <DesertPenguin> Hey Pat. I just wanna say thank you for taking the time to read my posts and say them out loud when they're relevant. It really means a lot to get noticed
[2:07:54] <%Broand> Estus shard
[2:07:57] <RutilusMonachus> Didn't Cinders intentionally remove all soft and hard caps?
[2:07:58] <%reinbachthe3rd> People are saying there are no soft caps?
[2:07:58] <%heartlesshealer> Did the mod change? :0c
[2:07:58] <Shishi1205> At least vanilla the things are different
[2:08:03] <dinnydanny777> Buff luck
[2:08:11] <Robot_Nixon_> Vigor built Kappa
[2:08:17] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> holy shit I can see pat again
[2:08:17] <AlphaTauri> no madness catalyst huh?
[2:08:20] <+maynardftw> @Lizard0TM There's no hard caps except 99 on each stat
[2:08:23] <Jontman42> it's tradition that Pat finishes NG with NG+ levels
[2:08:24] <%trustycoyote> @Broand Oh a shard? Not bad
[2:08:28] <jhonxiolonn> BIG fp
[2:08:31] <arkv01> pat molted his fur
[2:08:32] <+maynardftw> @Lizard0TM Pretty sure, at least
[2:08:33] <KorysHere> 60 attunement is scary
[2:08:37] <Shishi1205> Check the "locked" chest just in case Pat
[2:08:40] <%Lizard0TM> I'm aware
[2:08:41] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I can beat off to pat again
[2:08:47] <DesertPenguin> LUL LUL LUL
[2:08:47] <%heartlesshealer> People are saying to double check the locked chest because goblins
[2:08:49] <%Lizard0TM> there are no Caps Pat
[2:08:50] <xWanderingFlame> Put it all in luck
[2:08:51] <%PaladinDupre> Do you need all those slots?
[2:08:53] <DesertPenguin> I actually believe you
[2:08:55] <Bluewolf544> Luck
[2:08:59] <%heartlesshealer> and maybe a gain
[2:09:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> nvm its the same
[2:09:01] <dinnydanny777> Cinders is a fair and balanced game with no flaws whatsoever
[2:09:04] <+maynardftw> P good
[2:09:05] <Shishi1205> My god
[2:09:11] <tdmbr> so op
[2:09:13] <%reinbachthe3rd> Look at that naughty bar. Kreygasm

[2:09:17] <Bluewolf544> Balanced
[2:09:20] <Visorak6> What shield infusion are you using @PatStaresAt
[2:09:23] <%Starotter70> Grotesque, I like it
[2:09:25] <%heartlesshealer> blue bar best bar
[2:09:25] <+OffbeatMinority> wtf? what is with that hat????
[2:09:25] <Arisato_II> Mass destruction
[2:09:28] <derap41> This Mod is about as Ballanced as LongWar
[2:09:32] <Visorak6> Thanks
[2:09:33] <KorysHere> haha melee is still viable guys :')
[2:09:38] <%Broand> Pat's given himself blue bars again
[2:09:41] <Bluewolf544> The way magic should've always been MIYAZAKI
[2:09:49] <dinnydanny777> You're basically just a boss now
[2:09:49] <%heartlesshealer> melee is still super good with the items in the mod
[2:09:52] <Zombrocom> Melee lads can get absurdly tanky
[2:09:56] <KorysHere> you gotta dump a whole lot tho
[2:09:56] <TheArrow_> there are some WILD weapon arts
[2:10:03] <SomeOtherNeb> Pat, your Xenoblade stream made me get the game, thanks for the recommendation, it's a blast, I love the MMO-like combat
[2:10:04] <+SinisterBroccoli> I was playing a full dex build with the Rakuyo and my damage stat was at 1200
[2:10:07] <+maynardftw> @KorysHere It's super viable, I'm running with dex-bleed claws and katanas, basically melting everything.
[2:10:21] <xxshadowxx416> what about bows
[2:10:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> hey... where's Emlo. why is there a human on his stream

[2:10:48] <Scrub_Seeker> @dinnydanny777 yes, bows are just as busted as magic in this mod
[2:10:50] <SomeOtherNeb> oooh thank you
[2:10:52] <%aishman> Don't we see that in the full effect in Ring City?
[2:10:52] <Bluewolf544> We saw that in ringed city too didn't we ?
[2:10:53] <Zombrocom> CInders uses Dota balancing, everything is OP
[2:10:54] <olaksi> yep, an excuse for fucked geography. still not as bad as DS2
[2:10:56] <+Invlux> Content Aware Scaling
[2:10:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's why Carthus and Irithyll are under Lothric
[2:10:59] <derap41> Wouldn't space being crushed togheter increase fire==
[2:11:00] <TheArrow_> everything is buffed as hell, even throwing knives and stuff
[2:11:01] <+SinisterBroccoli> NG+ is also pretty fun, they change things up quite a bit
[2:11:02] <KorysHere> i always feel like without stacking status affects im dropping off more than my unupgraded catalysts can do at base
[2:11:08] <Arisato_II> Literally the beginning of Ringed City

[2:11:35] <Zombrocom> Primordial Slab
[2:11:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pride
[2:11:38] <Shishi1205> Something about health?
[2:11:38] <%Hegelundra> attraction
[2:11:39] <Reckless_Rob> Undead curse
[2:11:39] <%heartlesshealer> who knows the curses?
[2:11:40] <+maynardftw> @KorysHere I'm using bleed on my weapon, frost on my gloves. I've heard curse does well, but I haven't been able to figure out how to put that on at the same time as the others.
[2:11:40] <AlphaTauri> Fortitude
[2:11:40] <nepwar> ringed city geography just mashed and folding on itself was really cool
[2:11:41] <%Coystick> Super God Shard Super Shard
[2:11:41] <iosephe> Wrath
[2:11:42] <dinnydanny777> What a horrible night to have a curse
[2:11:43] <Arisato_II> Wrth
[2:11:44] <Zombrocom> Do obscurity, trust me Kappa
[2:11:44] <%ArcanumMBD> All of them
[2:11:47] <damascussteele> wrath
[2:11:48] <nepwar> gut
[2:11:48] <%TrollKing96> World looks like a fucked up Pangea.
[2:11:49] <Arisato_II> Pat Wrath
[2:11:50] <AlphaTauri> Wrath is the easiest imo
[2:11:51] <TheArrow_> each curse adds another roll for the slab @PatStaresAt
[2:11:51] <+vampireinarm> I always find "end of the world" so narcissistic in stories, its the end of humanity, not the earth per say
[2:11:52] <%FacetiousAF> curse of orb
[2:11:55] <DesertPenguin> The eclipse thing is seriously just a Berserk reference. Miyazaki stopped caring about being subtle
[2:11:56] <%bread_assassin> What do they all do?
[2:11:58] <Bluewolf544> Curse of the broken AC
[2:11:59] <TheArrow_> @PatStaresAt you could get more than one
[2:11:59] <+SinisterBroccoli> Have you killed skelton? @PatStaresAt
[2:12:02] <Ultimatefool> Pat, Curse of Attraction literally spawns unique mobs that you may have missed
[2:12:13] <dinnydanny777> What else is even left in this world to die other than humans
[2:12:13] <Scrub_Seeker> under the altar of affliction page
[2:12:14] <%SmoothEnigma> there are 3 that are best due to upping drop chance of the primordial upgrades by 50% but I dont remember which ones
[2:12:16] <Shishi1205> he has @SinisterBroccoli
[2:12:19] <%FacetiousAF> broccoli i believe he killed skeleton last time
[2:12:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Affliction
[2:12:21] <%heartlesshealer> Unique mobs? :0c
[2:12:22] <dinnydanny777> Even the humans aren't really humans
[2:12:27] <%linSP> Isn‚Äôt there a key item that describes these
[2:12:28] <Bearheart223> @vampireinarm no but the entire world is converging onto the first flame, crumbling in on itself
[2:12:37] <%FacetiousAF> curse of huge dick
[2:12:43] <+chaggles> alter of affication
[2:12:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> ATTRACTION ADDS MORE ENMIES
[2:12:45] <dinnydanny777> I guess a few dogs would die too but those dogs are dicks
[2:12:47] <CrimsonCore90> Curse of large orb
[2:12:55] <Zombrocom> ***
[2:12:57] <RevenantJoy> Type in "Trial" or "Perseverance"?
[2:12:57] <%spitelite> the key item is called the wiki]
[2:13:00] <Bluewolf544> curse of the mustard
[2:13:02] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt its in the wiki under the "altar of affliction"'s page
[2:13:02] <%BudaBryan> turn them on and off to see what they do
[2:13:03] <%FacetiousAF> curse of elmo spores
[2:13:04] <%Hegelundra> @PatStaresAt which wiki are you using? try "trials of affliction"
[2:13:12] <KorysHere> @maynardftw i always liked doing quality builds but it just seems kinda eh with cinders
[2:13:17] <+Brandonxman> They also tell you what they do when you activate one
[2:13:17] <jhonxiolonn> oh nice
[2:13:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Afflictions describe when you select them, and you can toggle freely
[2:13:20] <Bluewolf544> curse of the mind goblins
[2:13:21] <dinnydanny777> Is that a scythe?
[2:13:26] <Zombrocom> *** heres the curses
[2:13:28] <%Broand> Pick the curse of randomness
[2:13:31] <dinnydanny777> Dark blade looks like a Scythe
[2:13:39] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @patstaresat Altar of Affliction page
[2:13:41] <Bluewolf544> These spells look sick
[2:13:41] <lordhavok98> if you click on a curse it will tell you hat it ows before equipping it
[2:13:46] <jhonxiolonn> but it can be fun
[2:13:52] <Bluewolf544> for science tho
[2:13:52] <%FacetiousAF> curse of lupus (thats my last one)
[2:13:59] <dinnydanny777> Is Dark Blade the spell that the snow DLC boss uses?
[2:14:04] <%Broand> I forget, is dark and pyromancy just better sorceries?
[2:14:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah it's rad
[2:14:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> Curse of Pride is the easiest of the big ones
[2:14:09] <RantingRavager> THAT'S RAD
[2:14:10] <jhonxiolonn> Curse yourself
[2:14:11] <Bluewolf544> What
[2:14:12] <%Broand> In the end?
[2:14:14] <Shishi1205> thats a rad curse
[2:14:14] <+SunnyRmuffins> pentawX
[2:14:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[2:14:19] <Bluewolf544> MADA MADA
[2:14:19] <%Starotter70> Ooooh
[2:14:20] <+chaggles> I just have it on always
[2:14:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> ITS THE BEST
[2:14:22] <%Lizard0TM> more enemies and mini bosses is rad
[2:14:26] <+Invlux> Curse of Small Your Dick
[2:14:27] <%EtheralFlameX> yeah, you can even find black knights outside by the giant tree
[2:14:30] <RantingRavager> Curse of MORE CONTENT
[2:14:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> @chaggles Same brother
[2:14:35] <dinnydanny777> That's just a Scholar of the First Sin mode
[2:14:37] <%Mendin> Pat check Deep Protection which also unlocked
[2:14:41] <Bluewolf544> Curse of CUT CONTENT
[2:14:41] <dinnydanny777> Awesome
[2:14:56] <Bluewolf544> Stagger seems so good
[2:15:00] <%linSP> Restart game time
[2:15:02] <dinnydanny777> Curse of the Scholar of the first sin
[2:15:03] <jhonxiolonn> you should curse yourself abit, to make the game more challenging
[2:15:07] <Bluewolf544> infinite stagger trivialised everything
[2:15:11] <+Invlux> @patstaresat the trials are way easier with Solaire, the Crab, and the Lizard buddies
[2:15:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pride is real manageable, and gives you big rewards
[2:15:14] <Shishi1205> Wrath?
[2:15:16] <%Coystick> Curse of sexy
[2:15:21] <Ultimatefool> @PatStaresAt I used Attraction and Wrath, made it really fun
[2:15:21] <Bluewolf544> @dinnydanny777 lol
[2:15:22] <classypigeon234> curse of the soul of the blood of the wolf
[2:15:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[2:15:25] <+maynardftw> @KorysHere Yeah quality isn't as great at the beginning, you want to focus on just one primary damage stat, and then if you want you can pump the other one up evenly in a respec, but it's not as effective as a single 99 in a stat with blunt or sharp I don't think.
[2:15:27] <+Soulbishop> Pat reading the curses made me think PatScaredAt should be the new channel name
[2:15:29] <Zombrocom> Attraction is only 10% chance though
[2:15:30] <+chaggles> throw on obscurity to see how bad it is
[2:15:36] <%ArcanumMBD> Curse of Damn Girl You Lookin' Fine
[2:15:42] <+Invlux> let's partyyy
[2:15:47] <%YakumoYomi> Giving more stamina to enemies seems really manageable for a guy that one-shots them anyway.
[2:15:52] <Shishi1205> what
[2:15:53] <DesertPenguin> This area is so much darker than usual. It's hard to see everything
[2:15:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> NO
[2:15:53] <Bluewolf544> boooo
[2:15:54] <jhonxiolonn> W
[2:15:57] <%EtheralFlameX> frailty is good because you'll kill everything in 1 hit anyway
[2:15:58] <Arisato_II> I'm sorry what

[2:18:55] <Bluewolf544> GAVLAN

[2:18:56] <dinnydanny777> Those enemies are really well modeled
[2:19:01] <SaltyAzteca> Many wheels, Many deals
[2:19:02] <Arisato_II> WHEEL DEALT
[2:19:03] <+ATorL> I thought Gavlan was a dwarf, not a giant
[2:19:04] <Zombrocom> Nah, they are reskinned Winged Knights
[2:19:05] <+Leon_Spencer> this is like a weak army of O&S

[2:19:53] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> So is this how you farm Souls?
[2:19:53] <%UvBenServed> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[2:20:01] <+maynardftw> Got juked
[2:20:04] <%heartlesshealer> it's just a bunch of cape boys

[2:20:05] <SGrim> Good thing Pat's build is StinkyCheese so he doesn't have to try.
[2:20:06] <dinnydanny777> They're styling
[2:20:12] <Ultimatefool> @couch_potato_Ed_Boy Nah, you get an assload in NG+ in this mod
[2:20:13] <+ConLin_Arts_> is this just Oluympus Colliseum from KH??
[2:20:13] <@SoFarFetched> IT WAS A GRAVEYARD SMASH
[2:20:14] <Shishi1205> They might be models from ds2 but the base enemy has to be based on a ds3 one
[2:20:14] <arkv01> wow deez weakass bitches
[2:20:15] <+maynardftw> @couch_potato_Ed_Boy No, you farm souls via boss grinding. You farm materials via this.
[2:20:19] <%YakumoYomi> Better get used to that Gravetender moveset...
[2:20:19] <Bluewolf544> The final boss is giant dad PogChamp
[2:20:20] <+ConLin_Arts_> Olympus**
[2:20:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> No
[2:20:25] <+Invlux> Nope
[2:20:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @couch_potato_Ed_Boy Refighting bosses is probably faster, but this is good for materials
[2:20:27] <Zombrocom> Nah
[2:20:30] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @maynardftw Alright thanks
[2:20:30] <Zombrocom> Of course not
[2:20:30] <SomeOtherNeb> no
[2:20:30] <AlphaTauri> Enemies drop estus sometimes
[2:20:31] <%CrookedSpiral> this would be perfect for the rapid-fire Dregs spells
[2:20:31] <Shishi1205> Just like the mirror knight is the Dragonslayer armor
[2:20:34] <%heartlesshealer> Estus remain
[2:20:40] <%heartlesshealer> YEYEYE

[2:20:56] <SleepyMaribo> is this a boss rush?
[2:20:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> U can summon Solaire tho
[2:21:02] <dinnydanny777> I am having bad memories of DS2
[2:21:04] <+Invlux> But I've noticed a chug or two refill after killing enemies
[2:21:06] <Bluewolf544> holy fuck
[2:21:06] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Alright thanks for replying @Valentinius_Anodyne @Ultimatefool

[2:21:29] <Shishi1205> AI is a bit borked
[2:21:32] <dinnydanny777> This boss fight was so annoying in DS2
[2:21:34] <Arisato_II> That one against the wall regrets it
[2:21:39] <%UvBenServed> At least it's not on a rooftop again
[2:21:39] <meltfe77> Cheese them out pat
[2:21:39] <%bendatron> i forgot gargoyles were even in the game

[2:21:55] <buffaloaf13> psaDab
[2:22:02] <+maynardftw> @Invlux Yup, base game feature. And you get more refills via online stuff, which you can't generally do in this game.
[2:22:03] <Arisato_II> *teleports behind you*
[2:22:05] <DesertPenguin> It "is" a frenzy after all

[2:30:09] <DesertPenguin> Cat just showed up and sat in my lap. Me happy now
[2:30:10] <%heartlesshealer> They have to hit
[2:30:10] <xWanderingFlame> Exciting.

[2:30:26] <+Jaysky> You're trapped now @DesertPenguin
[2:30:27] <dinnydanny777> Your HP stat depends on your thiccness
[2:30:28] <%xcompleasedad> At this point, I seriously think that having resistance to Dark is going to be negligible for the enemies.
[2:30:29] <KorysHere> that 60 attunement coming in clutch
[2:30:33] <%Broand> psaBig
[2:30:37] <%FacetiousAF> its basically a legion of paiges

[2:30:54] <%kd0g_> How tf do you beat this without magic
[2:30:54] <SomeOtherNeb> all the things she said?
[2:30:54] <%Ynkubus18> just dont get hit
[2:30:58] <dinnydanny777> This would also suck with melee
[2:31:03] <$ItsRatman> so uh how the fiuck do you do this as a melee build?
[2:31:03] <+LiveStreamOnyx> A lot of guys throw at orb of a man, live in stream mischaDrink

[2:31:43] <%Bailey__gaming> @PatStaresAt did this mod make bows/archery viable?
[2:31:43] <dinnydanny777> It can't possibly get worse, can it?

[2:32:41] <Arisato_II> I don't know if you can do this as a melee build
[2:32:41] <SomeOtherNeb> 285k LUL
[2:32:42] <Shishi1205> Those are not botch enemies so yeah

[2:33:12] <Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt How do you access the boss rush?
[2:33:19] <Psyramics> for an artillery build, yeah
[2:33:21] <jhonxiolonn> No crazy talk?
[2:33:22] <%YakumoYomi> Less enemies, but they're also slower and specifically weak to your build
[2:33:22] <%Mr_Pylon> If the crocs didn't taunt it'd be tougher, it's probably a nightmare pure melee
[2:33:25] <%heartlesshealer> too far

[2:34:01] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Soull of cinder was bugged on the refights and I farmed the primordial slabs from him
[2:34:03] <%CalderGaming> grats
[2:34:03] <superchronicc> EZ CLSP
[2:34:04] <+RyuMojo> Horray for coward!
[2:34:04] <DesertPenguin> Do your dance
[2:34:05] <Ultimatefool> That was really good, Pat, nice spell casting
[2:34:05] <The_Cysquatch> My final wave the first time through was a mob of silver knights. That one was tough.
[2:34:06] <%Prism_Wing> what a finish.
[2:34:08] <+dirtyh4rr1> HUGE
[2:34:10] <bazz_tv> Thats it?
[2:34:10] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> MOAR
[2:34:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Was that well what is it or praise the sun. Your answer is important
[2:34:13] <Bluewolf544> Buy the dark spells
[2:34:16] <DesertPenguin> THat's it?
[2:34:16] <%Mendin> ASCEND, ASCEND WITH GORB
[2:34:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> They do not, no. TO THE WIKI
[2:34:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Maids4lyfe I honestly think it's a straightup improvement to DS3 in every way, you should
[2:34:16] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> i believe a gamer might say "ggez"
[2:34:17] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Nope
[2:34:18] <DesertPenguin> No big boss at the end?
[2:34:21] <Ultimatefool> No, you need to wiki it
[2:34:23] <SGrim> Acsend them anyway
[2:34:23] <+maynardftw> Do they do different things when ascended?
[2:34:24] <sylvainsilver> psaSkelmoney
[2:34:28] <Bluewolf544> @patstaresat Check all the spells you haven't seen
[2:34:29] <TheArrow_> a lot of them have less fp cost or better tracking
[2:34:32] <+maynardftw> Do weapons do different things when they're ascended?
[2:34:33] <Ultimatefool> But the ascended effects are often broken as fuck
[2:34:33] <%Broand> practice cast it
[2:34:43] <%YakumoYomi> Reduced FP cost, better tracking, etc.
[2:34:45] <sendart> dark dance is even more broken
[2:34:45] <DesertPenguin> Boooooooooo
[2:34:46] <jhonxiolonn> get the damage buff one too
[2:34:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Honestly most Dark spells have kinda shit ascended bonuses.
[2:35:03] <jdanov> Dark Dance does more poise dmg when ascended @PatStaresAt
[2:35:06] <Scrub_Seeker> dark dance does more poise damage, not visible on the skeleton
[2:35:13] <sylvainsilver> psaSkelmoney
[2:35:19] <%W1nterTitan> Pat turn off the curse
[2:35:20] <+Kingtut9009> It loosk different too
[2:35:30] <%Maids4lyfe> oh does the mod also fix poise?
[2:35:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Wow more poise damage on the one shot
[2:35:34] <Psyramics> put the wiki up on stream
[2:35:35] <%EtheralFlameX> power within works with it and now has a 0.01% health drain
[2:35:43] <%Taisuru> @Maids4lyfe Yes

[2:38:29] <DesertPenguin> It's a bullet
[2:38:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> Curse kinda sucks I think
[2:38:41] <%xcompleasedad> Just curse them
[2:38:41] <jhonxiolonn> cursed
[2:38:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh god
[2:38:45] <+maynardftw> Get cursed with two hits, I suppose
[2:38:45] <kingra> 4000
[2:38:47] <+Invlux> 2 hits for curse pop
[2:38:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Most enemies die before they get cursed
[2:38:49] <%Mendin> two hit curse
[2:38:52] <+maynardftw> I don't even know what curse does in this mod
[2:38:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> wait what does curse do again
[2:38:54] <$lotharrio> Curse is stat down?
[2:38:55] <+keyoray> LuvSign sipsipHellmo
[2:39:00] <+SinisterBroccoli> lowers stats
[2:39:01] <DesertPenguin> I wanna see everyone die to curse and your game world is full of statues
[2:39:02] <SGrim> Curse bosses?
[2:39:02] <dinnydanny777> Curse is health down?
[2:39:03] <%Mendin> @maynardftw It's another not-Bleed
[2:39:08] <+SinisterBroccoli> and chuck of damage
[2:39:11] <%Niney_Who> ROCK
[2:39:11] <KorysHere> you can curse humanoid bosses its hilarious
[2:39:13] <%Taisuru> It's big damage
[2:39:15] <TheArrow_> curse is only relevant for bosses, but it can be pretty good against them
[2:39:16] <Ultimatefool> Curse reduces their absorption in this, really strong
[2:39:17] <Shishi1205> no faith
[2:39:18] <SGrim> Needs faith\
[2:39:24] <%Starotter70> Chat, do you think Double D had another Penis underneath his hat?
[2:39:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @maynardftw Damage+ Reduced attack and absorbtion
[2:39:34] <%EtheralFlameX> power within is better than deep protection
[2:39:39] <Dumb_Guitarist> @starotter70 yes
[2:39:44] <+SinisterBroccoli> Starotter70 I always thought it was his balls
[2:39:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> No faith
[2:39:49] <+maynardftw> @Valentinius_Anodyne Is it better than frost?
[2:39:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Check out ascended Recollection. Dark pyromancy.
[2:39:52] <%YakumoYomi> Boulder Heave is great at close range. I used it to essentially punish all of Friede's melee attack
[2:39:53] <+maynardftw> Or bleed for that matter
[2:39:54] <%Taisuru> You also don't have the stats for protection
[2:39:55] <Scrub_Seeker> ascended power within drains like no health at all
[2:39:57] <Shishi1205> Do pyromancies ascend too? @PatStaresAt
[2:39:59] <+Invlux> Deep protection's bonus is effectively doubled
[2:40:03] <Shishi1205> If so check Boulder
[2:40:06] <dinnydanny777> Earthquake?
[2:40:07] <%Taisuru> @Shishi1205 Yes
[2:40:07] <+wellshuckit> You can level faith now with the extra souls.
[2:40:12] <%FacetiousAF> oh god the fuckin boulder
[2:40:15] <Arisato_II> Actually blind?
[2:40:15] <%Mendin> Blind
[2:40:16] <Ookamiden02> you passed it
[2:40:16] <SaltyAzteca> you passed it
[2:40:16] <koffeemancer> You passed it
[2:40:16] <+DinnerCalzone> I think you passed it
[2:40:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> you missed it
[2:40:17] <dinnydanny777> Earthquake seems strong
[2:40:18] <Visorak6> blind
[2:40:19] <DuoScratch> I saw the spell in his list Pat
[2:40:20] <Vindicato> Passed it
[2:40:21] <%GhostThane> it's there lmao
[2:40:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> HE HASPOWER WITHIN
[2:40:23] <%djblue_shift> psaBlind psaBlind
[2:40:27] <Reanimator83> How long has Pat been on?
[2:40:30] <+chaggles> sacred oath got buffed
[2:40:31] <Shishi1205> bottom
[2:40:35] <Arisato_II> First column
[2:40:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @maynardftw Hard to outright say if it's better, but it does stack, especially on weapons like Darkdrift that do both Bleed and Curse
[2:40:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> Just use Unleash Magic
[2:41:12] <Quite_Dapper> YOU WENT OVER IT
[2:41:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @maynardftw Curse is less damage on proc if I remember correctly
[2:41:18] <Quite_Dapper> oh wait im on delay
[2:41:24] <+maynardftw> @Valentinius_Anodyne I did forget Darkdrift did both. Hm. I've been mostly ignoring katanas, their special attacks aren't as neat as fist weapons.
[2:41:28] <Ultimatefool> Sacred oath is busted, you can become a cloth tank
[2:41:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Unleash Magic boosts Dark damage by 20%, doesn't require Faith, and only reduces absorption by 25% when ascended
[2:41:42] <Shishi1205> check boulder too @PatStaresAt
[2:41:44] <%PaladinDupre> Power within sucks
[2:41:48] <segychan> !uptime
[2:41:48] <+Invlux> lose way less health
[2:41:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 42m.

[2:42:11] <rcand9> too strong
[2:42:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @maynardftw Darkdrift has been real nice on my Dex/Fth build, but I've been mostly ignoring katanas otherwise
[2:42:12] <%YakumoYomi> Power Overwhelming!
[2:42:14] <%WhereIsWill> kaio ken with no penalties PogChamp
[2:42:14] <%PaladinDupre> HE
[2:42:16] <SaltyAzteca> THE POWER WITHIIIIIIIIIIN
[2:42:19] <DesertPenguin> Fuck yea
[2:42:20] <dinnydanny777> Fair and balanced
[2:42:23] <DesertPenguin> I mean you didn't before but okay
[2:42:23] <%PaladinDupre> RESPEC FINISH YOUR DRINKS
[2:42:27] <rcand9> big feet
[2:42:28] <jimmytwofeet> SLUG BE THICC
[2:42:29] <jhonxiolonn> but but it isn't dark and endgy and cool!
[2:42:40] <DesertPenguin> Do what not?
[2:42:42] <DesertPenguin> now*
[2:43:01] <%Alpha8087> Get stronk
[2:43:15] <%Typhaeon> Hey there Cinderella, how goes it
[2:43:19] <+Kinggarbage> Hi Pat how are you today?
[2:43:21] <dinnydanny777> The power was inside us all along
[2:43:24] <$lotharrio> Pat, I wanna test you.
[2:43:27] <%W1nterTitan> Pat did you disable the curse from the altar?
[2:43:37] <+maynardftw> ^
[2:43:38] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt power within affects all damage, should buff your spells too
[2:43:43] <%Alpha8087> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[2:43:48] <Shishi1205> AScended boulder has a larger range and does more posie dmg @PatStaresAt
[2:43:51] <jhonxiolonn> Why are you guys reminding him
[2:44:06] <$lotharrio> I think you'll find. The things I teach ya are sure to beat ya. Listen up, and get a lesson from teacha.
[2:44:08] <%PaladinDupre> THE BOULDER!
[2:44:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Boulder! Boulder! Boulder!
[2:44:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Unleash Magic is just better than Power Within if you don't get hit.
[2:44:16] <Shishi1205> just checking because it is cool
[2:44:22] <%FacetiousAF> MORE POISE???
[2:44:30] <transporterthesequel> Ya‚Äôll dudes love Boulder
[2:44:46] <Zombrocom> Unleash magic is from midir though, that's a ways off
[2:44:48] <AlphaTauri> ascended boulder misses a lot
[2:44:52] <%YakumoYomi> Boulder is probably stronger than Great Deep Soul at close range, and fucks up anyone that can be knocked down.
[2:45:02] <Delrugal_> Dreg Torrent fires even more projectiles when ascended
[2:45:03] <%Ynkubus18> Throwing big rocks is fun
[2:45:18] <+maynardftw> Magic in this game kinda feels like how in the old Might and Magic games you'd eventually unlock the Blaster weapon, and everyone in your party would switch off whatever various things they did to specialize in that because it was objectively the strongest thing, but it turned the game into an FPS rather than the turn-based RPG it was originally.
[2:45:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Big Rock is the ultimate Pyromancy
[2:45:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Dark Blade will just counter Power Within
[2:45:19] <kingra> That is nothing
[2:45:28] <dinnydanny777> Burn yourself to gain power
[2:45:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dark Blade regens as much as Power Within drains
[2:45:34] <Shishi1205> its dark edge
[2:45:41] <kingra> 300 more damage
[2:45:49] <Shishi1205> way more dmg
[2:45:54] <%heartlesshealer> danger of pat's soothing screeches. I fell asleep in front of the fan until the phone rang
[2:45:55] <Ultimatefool> @PatStaresAt Also Lingering Dragoncrest Ring doubles the duration
[2:45:56] <%PaladinDupre> THATS ALOTTA DAMAGE
[2:46:02] <%EtheralFlameX> power within and deep protection don't stack incase you're wondering
[2:46:16] <+maynardftw> Yeah you don't need a 12% increase
[2:46:20] <+maynardftw> You need a double duration increase
[2:46:50] <%Manwad> we juice world now?
[2:46:55] <%Mendin> Gonna check Cemetary of Ash once the minmaxing is completed?
[2:46:58] <%heartlesshealer> get climax in there somewhere for sniping
[2:47:00] <chrishansen69_> Not too shabby.. that 7%
[2:47:04] <%Niney_Who> Heave Boulder you coward
[2:47:05] <%heartlesshealer> good lineup
[2:47:06] <maxpasta> Maxmin
[2:47:10] <%Niney_Who> Vomit psaBig rock
[2:47:16] <Reanimator83> Power the balls
[2:47:18] <%Mendin> yee
[2:47:24] <%Taisuru> Throw rock
[2:47:33] <%heartlesshealer> uses so little of the bar <3
[2:47:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> Lingering Dragoncrest also halves the damage of Power Within since it does the same total over twice the duration
[2:48:00] <+Invlux> Any regen you have is probably outhealing it
[2:48:01] <classypigeon234> divert power to rocks
[2:48:03] <Shishi1205> Btw deep soul spells get more curse @PatStaresAt
[2:48:04] <%Daniel_Is_I> They removed the pus of man
[2:48:06] <+maynardftw> There did used to be a guy there
[2:48:11] <%Mendin> They changed it
[2:48:11] <SomeOtherNeb> I...don't remember this guy at all?
[2:48:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Pus appears to be gone
[2:48:16] <%ogtrashwizard> Does it stack per cast?
[2:48:17] <olm46> It probably feels like bad chafing for your character.
[2:48:18] <+chaggles> pus of man
[2:48:19] <%heartlesshealer> maybe he's not activated?
[2:48:20] <personmanthingg> this is just bullying with these guys
[2:48:21] <%heartlesshealer> wait
[2:48:21] <+Invlux> HERE WE GO BOYS
[2:48:24] <+chaggles> and its not in 1.75

[3:04:08] <%PaladinDupre> never pick up the white branch
[3:04:08] <%heartlesshealer> Does it kill him because he no longer sees where to aim?
[3:04:16] <AllenDeadman> so another giant kills him>
[3:04:16] <theragergamer1177> Pat you killed him
[3:04:18] <%Mendin> I think his job is done
[3:04:19] <AllenDeadman> ?*
[3:04:24] <mrblack499> wait the big guy is a tree lover?
[3:04:33] <%Mendin> since you went to each tree and he cleared those areas for you
[3:04:40] <%boneroni31> in the normal game yes
[3:04:43] <+SinisterBroccoli> does that tree look less white?
[3:04:45] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> what bosses has pat got so far
[3:04:49] <+desfore> Yeah, the reason he shoots is to protet the white tree
[3:04:59] <%heartlesshealer> oh no...

[3:05:08] <personmanthingg> leap of faith?
[3:05:11] <dinnydanny777> Big drop
[3:05:13] <%heartlesshealer> so since the white trees are looted and despoiled, he gives up and just dies

[3:19:53] <+maynardftw> Using a shield at all is already resin
[3:19:53] <SomeOtherNeb> I agree
[3:19:54] <%Meltdown547> You're in the wrong series if you care about clipping.
[3:19:55] <%Starotter70> Sounds like the dumb hat is the problem
[3:19:55] <%dekkitout> That's rough, gobby
[3:19:56] <%Maids4lyfe> GET RID OF THE HAT THEN
[3:19:56] <DuoScratch> The hat transcends space and time, it's MEANT to clip through things!

[3:22:00] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt check the kris blade's description

[3:22:03] <%thegalvanicpanic> burial blade? oh you mean diggy stabby
[3:22:03] <dinnydanny777> That sword looked cool
[3:22:03] <%YakumoYomi> They always have human faces
[3:22:04] <%Maids4lyfe> they're not actually dogs
[3:22:05] <TheZearGuy> Stats don‚Äôt matter. Do you look good with it? That‚Äôs important.
[3:22:07] <Shishi1205> they are pontiff experiments
[3:22:07] <%PlagueOfGripes> what game most makes you feel like your idea of a "real" sorcerer?
[3:22:10] <%Maids4lyfe> they're Outriders without the armor
[3:22:11] <theragergamer1177> Skull dogs
[3:22:11] <%heartlesshealer> The dogs have human skulls
[3:22:13] <BallerSwagBro9k> @PlagueOfGripes If u had to draw Pat as a Pokemon which one would u pick?
[3:22:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SuperFineButtHairs Pet the doggos.... with your blade
[3:22:21] <%SuperFineButtHairs> bloodborne crawlers
[3:22:23] <%PlagueOfGripes> people say dragon's dogma a lot since the spells are like movies you throw
[3:22:24] <sendart> kris blad?
[3:22:25] <Zombrocom> @PlagueOfGripes Dragons dogma, 100%
[3:22:31] <band_of_thehawk> "time to ignore all of you" REEE
[3:22:34] <dinnydanny777> The Kris blade looked super cool
[3:22:41] <+WutangchickeN> DDDA is a good pick
[3:22:43] <Shishi1205> try abysal so we see you pancake people @PatStaresAt
[3:22:46] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @SuperFineButtHairs we shoudl combine our strength to become the ultimate ass-ass-in
[3:22:46] <+maynardftw> This is a great place to grind for covenant drops
[3:22:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BallerSwagBro9k We all know votorb
[3:23:07] <%PlagueOfGripes> so spells are more satisfying if they're huge, long lasting but have long wind ups?
[3:23:10] <Arisato_II> NOT THE WHEEL DEAL
[3:23:11] <BallerSwagBro9k> @doc_ock_rokc Of course LUL
[3:23:14] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt check the kris blade, it buffs your magic when you hold it

[3:23:32] <dinnydanny777> RIP Gavlan
[3:23:35] <+WutangchickeN> @plagueofgripes if the spells feel busted when they go off

[3:23:54] <%SuperFineButtHairs> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries do the fusion dance with me
[3:23:55] <skyentombment> Is that actually a Gavlan?
[3:24:00] <restingbones> He do the SPEEN like Garren from League
[3:24:00] <%Ner234> Giant even
[3:24:01] <Gallhint> i wish it made a silly accordion noise when it pancaked them
[3:24:01] <%JumboCrunchies> @YakumoYomi It has much longer range, but you aren't wrong.
[3:24:03] <$lotharrio> Sure like Gavlan.
[3:24:04] <%PlagueOfGripes> I think part of feeling like a real wizard is feeling overpowered

[3:29:41] <%SuperFineButtHairs> SMAUUUUG
[3:29:42] <%PlagueOfGripes> for chat, we talked about this all last night, but basically, Hunt Showdown has economy problems due to being a permadeath BR-like that still has gear grind and character levels
[3:29:44] <%YakumoYomi> Giant outside
[3:29:44] <Shishi1205> nope
[3:29:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH

[3:30:16] <%SuperFineButtHairs> you knew?
[3:30:17] <%weissguard> Hunt Showdown sounds a bit nightmarish, if not interesting.
[3:30:18] <dinnydanny777> Why do those make that noise
[3:30:21] <Shishi1205> the sound comes from those uh?
[3:30:25] <%Starotter70> oh

[3:30:33] <skyentombment> RANDOM GIANT
[3:30:34] <SomeOtherNeb> hello
[3:30:34] <Zombrocom> It was him making that noiuse
[3:30:39] <PanicSwytch> I thought Pat was a Souls expert
[3:30:39] <band_of_thehawk> das a beeg yoshi
[3:30:45] <%PlagueOfGripes> PvE mode may come this year, so that's... maybe good. assuming it has coop and doesn't punish you for not playing the "real" pvp modes
[3:30:49] <skyentombment> CLIMAX HIM , PAT, QUICKLY
[3:30:55] <+WutangchickeN> what
[3:30:58] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> why isnt power within doing damage to pat
[3:31:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> Cant belive i missed those stair after soooooooo many playthroughs
[3:31:08] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @superfinebutthairs dude for a second I thought your name said superfinebuttholes
[3:31:09] <AllenDeadman> he was just vibing... looking for gamer girl feet
[3:31:11] <+WutangchickeN> that's a huge bitch
[3:31:12] <BlacSoul> ascended
[3:31:12] <Scrub_Seeker> @AsslessChapsVEVO it is, just a very small amount
[3:31:13] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> why would the mod do this
[3:31:15] <Slothjoe> How is there mana regen?
[3:31:16] <Shishi1205> its ascended
[3:31:16] <%SuperFineButtHairs> cuz pat is cheating bitch who smells like pizza
[3:31:21] <%PlagueOfGripes> I hate this stretch
[3:31:23] <dinnydanny777> Soul arrows
[3:31:24] <SomeOtherNeb> @AsslessChapsVEVO ascended version doesn't do damage
[3:31:24] <personmanthingg> ascended version does basically no self damage @AsslessChapsVEVO
[3:31:27] <dinnydanny777> Magicians revenge
[3:31:29] <%DappercatEsquire> I'm too risk averse to play Hunt Showdown
[3:31:29] <%Alpha8087> @AsslessChapsVEVO It is Ascended, basically imprvoed version that barely damages him
[3:31:37] <%SuperFineButtHairs> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck thanks
[3:31:38] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> fuck this part
[3:31:48] <%rytyoung> stahp that
[3:31:55] <%heartlesshealer> Pat made Power Within into an Ascended spell, so it's not hurting him really
[3:31:57] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @superfinebutthairs sry didn't mean to offend
[3:32:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> OH that the downside to power within
[3:32:13] <rcand9> new shantae is out people, get ready for big pronz
[3:32:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> It erases your yellow health
[3:32:28] <Shishi1205> damn
[3:32:29] <%PlagueOfGripes> the whole permadeath thing mixed with how little money you make is what hurts Hunt the most for me. you basically need to be really good and in a team every match or it'll delete your character every match
[3:32:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> GATSU
[3:32:32] <dinnydanny777> That's a good enemy placement
[3:32:33] <%Agami23> i feel like irithyll is like a week away from becoming a new yharnam
[3:32:33] <Arisato_II> UNEXPECTED Irithryll dog
[3:32:34] <thebestestkevin> Yeah that guy scared the shit outta me too first time i went here
[3:32:36] <+pectusumbra> yeah it came out a few days ago. I haven't touched it yet. Did get paid today, might buy it, but still so much terraria to go
[3:32:37] <%SuperFineButtHairs> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck is okay, i love everyone equally
[3:32:40] <dinnydanny777> That is a very good enemy placement
[3:32:44] <+kg4q> how is the ur FP regenerating quick? @PatStaresAt
[3:32:45] <%Broand> huh don't you usually get that rapier in lothric castle
[3:32:48] <+Invlux> those dudes have always had the most unpredictable strings
[3:32:49] <Shishi1205> mod
[3:32:56] <DuoScratch> ya know...I never thought about it, but you never actually see a freaking Irithyll Darkrider here normally.
[3:33:01] <%SuperFineButtHairs> youre a mod
[3:33:01] <%Alpha8087> Oh that sucks
[3:33:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Damn Hunt sounds kinda bad with that knowledge
[3:33:08] <nepwar> i dont get how you progress if theres permadeath in hunt
[3:33:09] <%Broand> I wonder what's there now

[3:33:35] <+Invlux> dodged
[3:33:37] <nepwar> living in da database database
[3:33:39] <%YakumoYomi> @DuoScratch I assumed it was because the Outriders are basically banished from the city.
[3:33:40] <%linSP> psaDab
[3:33:42] <+chase959> titles don't show on mobile
[3:33:42] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> does poise actually work in this mod?

[3:34:27] <+maynardftw> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck There is still diminishing returns and a soft cap on poise, though.

[3:35:46] <+Minorou> Isn't there an item to let you remove weapon effects
[3:35:59] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> can someone explain the uses of bug pellets?
[3:36:00] <+AlphaBankai> @plagueofgripes how's it going over there?
[3:36:02] <Arisato_II> Fuck this room in particular
[3:36:06] <+Invlux> What about Dark gloves then
[3:36:20] <+maynardftw> Pretty sure there is, from the old lady merchant @PatStaresAt
[3:36:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There is, Hand Maiden sells it
[3:36:24] <TheArrow_> i think the old lady sells it
[3:36:28] <Zombrocom> There is one, not sure if it works on the gloves
[3:36:42] <band_of_thehawk> goddamn does this mod mega boost enemy drops?
[3:36:46] <Shishi1205> hey hey people
[3:36:55] <SonicD4> watch it be lloyds tailsman
[3:36:56] <%PaladinDupre> ITEM ON STAIRS
[3:37:06] <Arisato_II> Merchant guild wants to talk to you
[3:37:06] <+pectusumbra> I believe it makes items no longer random drops
[3:37:09] <+AbnormalVoid> shushii
[3:37:11] <Reanimator83> Now I wanna watch Pat play Hunt: showdown
[3:37:14] <$Tuskor13> goldontable
[3:37:16] <Shishi1205> I was doing a Sseth joke for the merchant ring joke
[3:37:16] <%PaladinDupre> Its worth a lot to sell
[3:37:19] <+maynardftw> @PatStaresAt Also just to clarify, I mean the outrider gloves are the best under the assumption that your weapon already has bleed on it. If you can put bleed on your equipped gloves instead, that might be better if you don't.
[3:37:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @band_of_thehawk Not exactly. Unique weapons and such drop 100% of the time on first kill, enemies drop materials and consumable otherwise
[3:37:32] <Shishi1205> I've been here since the start
[3:37:51] <ToughBirch> made ya' flinch ya' mook
[3:38:00] <band_of_thehawk> ohhhh okay. thats a nice change honestly
[3:38:08] <dinnydanny777> Did Pontiff do nothing wrong
[3:38:14] <DuoScratch> in the square below
[3:38:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, one of the best QoL in the mod
[3:38:20] <BallerSwagBro9k> Time to fight a perfectly innocent priest thats done absolutely nothing wrong ever
[3:38:20] <Shishi1205> The pontiff has so many enemies
[3:38:21] <band_of_thehawk> griffith sure didnt
[3:38:33] <Shishi1205> You can summon a whole ass squad
[3:38:37] <%Nickmobox> Pontiff did absolutely nothing wrong
[3:38:41] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> it always astonished me that the world of Berserk is a better place to live than dark souls
[3:38:42] <BlacSoul> Pontiff helped Aldrich, he deserves it
[3:38:49] <DuoScratch> LOVE the fire witch set!
[3:38:52] <%YakumoYomi> Pontiff sold out best boy princess Gwyndolin, so he can burn
[3:38:55] <band_of_thehawk> it has lolis now
[3:38:56] <+pectusumbra> Summon back the fire witch, to the court of the Crimson KINGGGGGGGG
[3:38:57] <dinnydanny777> Is summoning allies even worth it when summoning allies reduces magic damage
[3:39:04] <Arisato_II> ehhh, 6/10
[3:39:08] <+Invlux> Lighter, less phys but more elemental?
[3:39:21] <%PaladinDupre> Brass Set hype
[3:39:23] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> pontiff has lightsabers though
[3:39:30] <dinnydanny777> I like how Dark Souls has unisex armours
[3:39:30] <BallerSwagBro9k> and a stand
[3:39:31] <+SinisterBroccoli> Frieda's set gives int
[3:39:33] <Shishi1205> yo twinkling?
[3:39:39] <Shishi1205> They drop twinkling?
[3:39:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @dinnydanny777 It lets you spell snipe in peace, so sure
[3:39:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> Karla's set gives max fp
[3:39:50] <%YakumoYomi> I bumped up my Vitality and threw on the Pursuer's set in my run.
[3:39:50] <+Invlux> Why do the pontiff knights sound like horses
[3:39:59] <%DappercatEsquire> Insanity Catalyst sounds like a fuckin Limp Bizkit song
[3:40:09] <Shishi1205> they do sound like horses
[3:40:23] <band_of_thehawk> friedas weapon best weapon. i couldn't figure out how to spell it. shame me accordingly
[3:40:36] <+Invlux> @YakumoYomi did they fix how the pursuer set makes your torso so goddamn huge?
[3:40:43] <Arisato_II> Dark sorcery brutallity
[3:40:44] <laserbeaming> If there's Twinkling titanite, where's the hunkling titanite and the bearling titanite?
[3:40:48] <skyentombment> So, I imagine that, since pat is on camera, I imagine his AC is finally fixed, right?
[3:40:56] <dinnydanny777> Cinders is a fair and balanced mod :)
[3:40:56] <%Starotter70> Yup
[3:41:08] <%YakumoYomi> @Invlux I don't think so. I was looking pretty chonky in it.
[3:41:14] <band_of_thehawk> this mod sorta seems like you become DoomGuy
[3:41:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> @skyentombment No none of this is real. Youre in a dream. You have to wake up
[3:41:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Honestly, is actually pretty balanced, Pat is real overleveled
[3:41:32] <Shishi1205> time to melt that
[3:41:35] <jacksawjack> Looks like Pat got blue bar hugerer

[3:42:07] <skyentombment> BallerSwagBro9k and go back to reality like an idiot? nah thanks
[3:42:09] <+maynardftw> @Valentinius_Anodyne They had to account for people grinding with the boss souls, though, so you can't say someone is overleveled

[3:43:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @maynardftw A fair point, though what I mean is that Pat is something like twice as high of a soul level then he needs to be to do Irithyll comfortably

[3:45:59] <super_robo_mg> yes, this is how dark souls was meant to be played, staying as far from the boss as possible and spamming magic
[3:46:00] <dinnydanny777> Oh lawd he's comin
[3:46:02] <%mMayrro> but yeah maybe they should nerf the lock on range a bit
[3:46:05] <Arisato_II> Well deserved suffering
[3:46:08] <ToneBacas> so much mana PogChamp
[3:46:09] <+vampireinarm> its almost like they made magic unusable in the original
[3:46:10] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> where do you normally get the big laser spell
[3:46:11] <ChoculaUltra> these magic Cinders builds seem to trivialize a lot of the content or am I buggin?
[3:46:15] <Zombrocom> Lock on range nerf is planned for 1.76
[3:46:18] <KorysHere> poor sully
[3:46:20] <dinnydanny777> Maybe they should give the Bosses further lock on range...
[3:46:22] <+Calern> great fight

[4:20:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @rumtumtugnutz Pat's something like Soul Level 115
[4:20:39] <Zombrocom> Pat is quite overleveld, he has a fully ascended catalyst, which he probably shouldn't at this point

[4:27:31] <%Agami23> man, i just learned about a pyromancy that cinders added and it makes me sad pat isnt playing pyro
[4:27:33] <Scrub_Seeker> its because he has multiplayer scaled health pat
[4:27:34] <olaksi> How is throwing a rock supposed to be "magic"?
[4:27:39] <%EtheralFlameX> Aldritch resists everything except fire

[4:28:05] <laserbeaming> So... Does Pat not have any alternate damage type for this situation? A fire sword or something?
[4:28:09] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> is she dead forever?
[4:28:10] <+Lost_Zombie> Pat too weak to save the wife
[4:28:11] <AllenDeadman> well... at least now we know the rock spit is not worth it
[4:28:13] <jhonxiolonn> oh, you can re doit, nice
[4:28:18] <personmanthingg> he should have some fire stuff
[4:28:26] <personmanthingg> or just sorceries?
[4:28:26] <dinnydanny777> So is Anri hollow
[4:28:29] <%YakumoYomi> @laserbeaming He's got the stats, but doesn't have the spells.
[4:28:29] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, use normal form spells or pyromancies. Dark build is kinda fucked here
[4:28:33] <yeetdabsenpai69> fire can help
[4:28:39] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @laserbeaming I‚Äôm not sure....everything else been dying to dark till now

[4:28:46] <mostundesired> Actual question, where in this mod is dark damage not fucked?
[4:28:46] <%heartlesshealer> DARK BUILD IS KINDA FUCKED HERE
[4:28:47] <%dekkitout> W A S T E D
[4:28:48] <shawshankiest> You could try using earthfall it does something like 800 physical damage
[4:28:49] <Jontman42> you could go for regular sorceries
[4:28:49] <RLT917> thats just Aldrich controlling a half eaten corpse
[4:28:49] <AllenDeadman> UNGA BUNGA DEAD
[4:28:51] <%weissguard> WOOF
[4:28:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "No" -Aldrich
[4:28:51] <+bugz_munny> The butthole pat
[4:28:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> DUNKED
[4:28:53] <%Agami23> hey pat, i just learned about a hidden pyromancy you missed if you care at all
[4:28:54] <%Maids4lyfe> have you tried just using fire?
[4:28:54] <%YakumoYomi> Both Dark and Magic are kinda fucked against Aldritch
[4:28:56] <+ianabstract> somebodys gettin fuuuuuucked
[4:28:57] <+bugz_munny> hit the butthole
[4:28:58] <%heartlesshealer> I mean your spells
[4:28:58] <$RealThiele> sleepy
[4:29:00] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> pat did you forget how to play the video game
[4:29:00] <%dekkitout> tajRLY
[4:29:02] <olaksi> Pat has been using OP mod magic too much, forgot how to play souls
[4:29:02] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat has been eating the dark pyromancy cheese for too long, and can no longer play the game
[4:29:05] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Time for Miracle
[4:29:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> Hows it feel Pat?....To be a biiiiiiiitch
[4:29:06] <%BudaBryan> use sun bro
[4:29:06] <%Maids4lyfe> we're talking about your spells
[4:29:06] <SonicD4> get fucked
[4:29:09] <Scrub_Seeker> go back and buy some pyros?
[4:29:12] <KorysHere> Aldritch, Devourer of Ass
[4:29:12] <cureneckbeard> one guy.
[4:29:19] <Shishi1205> use the weapon art too
[4:29:20] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> why
[4:29:20] <+WutangchickeN> fuckin owned
[4:29:21] <%EtheralFlameX> aldritch resists everything except fire
[4:29:22] <%heartlesshealer> sure why not, probably still counts as fire
[4:29:22] <classypigeon234> use pyro
[4:29:28] <%Taisuru> Pyromancy gogogo
[4:29:31] <%mMayrro> pretty sure its just dark
[4:29:31] <AllenDeadman> why not use regular magic?
[4:29:40] <$RealThiele> Dankromancy
[4:29:41] <Jontman42> shut up Anri I can't see the health bar
[4:29:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt By the by, with the new spell scaling, your enchanted hybrid tool is efficient at magic damage, not dark.
[4:29:44] <Zombrocom> Chaos fire orb wrecks aldy
[4:29:45] <+WutangchickeN> well the only thing left to do is completely restart the game with a new build.
[4:29:46] <$Dakuu75> dude, I cannot hear what she's saying under that helmet. thank god for subtitles
[4:29:49] <Ultimatefool> What about orange fire vestiges Kappa
[4:29:54] <+bugz_munny> You probably dont want to fight a long range battle with her
[4:30:00] <Shishi1205> Time to stack buffs
[4:30:04] <jhonxiolonn> your Fp regeneration is insane
[4:30:06] <Node_One> @WutangchickeN this, but unironically
[4:30:11] <%redrins> so is this aldritch a twink or...
[4:30:12] <dinnydanny777> Do you have a magic resistant shield?
[4:30:14] <AllenDeadman> can you aim it at his goo? I remember the goo takes more damage
[4:30:15] <+bugz_munny> whoa double slam
[4:30:23] <$Afterman_> that miasma does crazy dmg
[4:30:37] <%DappercatEsquire> Aldritch, get me pictures of Spider Man
[4:30:37] <%Broand> what if you infuse a pyromancy flame with ice
[4:30:43] <mostundesired> No but really, has there even been an area in this mod where dark damage isn't fucked?
[4:30:46] <%heartlesshealer> it's pretty neat lore-wise
[4:30:47] <jhonxiolonn> ember, pat
[4:30:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @redrins To be clear, Aldrich is the slime monster down below, not the twink on top
[4:30:52] <+masarusasaki> I didnt realize but the music uses gwyndolins music
[4:30:53] <Zombrocom> I like him in concept, I don't much like fighting him though
[4:30:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dark damage is also kinda fucked in ringed city
[4:30:58] <%riantDeliration> i love this boss and thats only half because i love Gwyndolin
[4:30:59] <Jontman42> Gwyndolin's seen better days
[4:31:00] <%Giantsuperguy> Giantsuperguy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[4:31:04] <jhonxiolonn> it has the theme, too
[4:31:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> Im sad about Gywndolin tho BibleThump
[4:31:11] <%mMayrro> its also super gross
[4:31:11] <mar_krow> u could say its neto
[4:31:12] <Gallhint> delicious trap goo
[4:31:15] <Shishi1205> Can you summon salire? @PatStaresAt
[4:31:18] <jhonxiolonn> Ember
[4:31:19] <%heartlesshealer> ????????
[4:31:20] <%xxshadowxx416> I wish dark soul was a mmo or so one made one like it
[4:31:20] <%mMayrro> half estus stumbo
[4:31:20] <%Maids4lyfe> phantoms have less Estus
[4:31:21] <LordOfThePoultry> WutFace
[4:31:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> You're a phantom, you have half estus
[4:31:24] <%Taisuru> Half flasks for multiplayer
[4:31:25] <AllenDeadman> pat LUL
[4:31:28] <%YakumoYomi> Half estus as a phantom
[4:31:31] <@JustinianKnight> heyo
[4:31:31] <+masarusasaki> no estus and just got to the second phase
[4:31:32] <jhonxiolonn> EMbER
[4:31:33] <$RealThiele> Aldritch is like what if Smough won DS1
[4:31:40] <%redrins> @Valentinius_Anodyne ye I know but gwyndolyn might as well just be part of him at this point
[4:31:43] <%Taisuru> ANRI JUST WALKIN THROUGH THAT AOE
[4:31:48] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt bring healing magic
[4:31:49] <+bugz_munny> lol anri just tanked that just like a boss
[4:31:52] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, multiplayer flask numbers
[4:31:53] <+masarusasaki> anri just face tanking all the dmg
[4:31:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> anari is kicking ass
[4:31:54] <@JustinianKnight> ripperoni
[4:31:57] <%AncelDeLambert> shit, when did Pat start?
[4:31:57] <+bugz_munny> AND HE STILL
[4:31:58] <+bugz_munny> WAT
[4:32:00] <Node_One> Oh, no.. Patrick.
[4:32:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> nice
[4:32:01] <Zombrocom> Great Chaos Fire Orb
[4:32:03] <%Aydarkzero> oh
[4:32:04] <dinnydanny777> Anri is literally walking
[4:32:05] <$RealThiele> sleepy
[4:32:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Might be worth trying balanced int/faith and dark infusion for this patch for big dark spell damage. Or not, since you like your physical sword.
[4:32:09] <%fredan31> how you liking to mod Pat?
[4:32:11] <@JustinianKnight> the trick is dont get hit
[4:32:11] <%YakumoYomi> Regular Pyromancy time?
[4:32:13] <%Agami23> getting hit hurts?
[4:32:13] <dinnydanny777> Anri is actually just walking
[4:32:14] <BallerSwagBro9k> you suck?
[4:32:15] <$Afterman_> can you use solaire in this fight
[4:32:16] <AllenDeadman> how about using the magic sword on the goo?
[4:32:18] <%heartlesshealer> psaGib
[4:32:20] <%Starotter70> @AncelDeLambert The stream? 3 Pm
[4:32:21] <%Taisuru> SUMMON SUN BRO
[4:32:22] <TheArrow_> run down to the pyromancy merchant and see if he has something cool to fuck that guy up with perhaps
[4:32:31] <Shishi1205> he gets staggered
[4:32:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> PRAISE THE SUN
[4:32:33] <jhonxiolonn> GO Rest on the
[4:32:36] <%DappercatEsquire> you need to beat his ass
[4:32:36] <shawshankiest> The profaned pyromancies might be good against him. Its how I beat hum using a dark build
[4:32:40] <Jontman42> this is correct
[4:32:41] <+earthboy2k> >his
[4:32:44] <%Starotter70> Just like Paige, the Ass is the weakness
[4:32:48] <jhonxiolonn> Oh, you have half the estuses
[4:32:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @redrins True enough. I guess that makes Aldrich a twunk technically, since he's a half twink?
[4:32:53] <+bugz_munny> That is the standard Ald strat yeah
[4:32:59] <mar_krow> praise the butt damage
[4:32:59] <LordOfThePoultry> pound his ass? KappaPride
[4:32:59] <%mMayrro> nice avoidance there
[4:33:01] <%Taisuru> SOLAIRE
[4:33:03] <Jontman42> just the tip
[4:33:10] <+Promessa_EX> let's go tip to but
[4:33:11] <$Afterman_> use ur sun bro pat!!!
[4:33:13] <@JustinianKnight> or just roll out
[4:33:17] <%redrins> slime twunk Kappa
[4:33:17] <+bugz_munny> LITERALLY
[4:33:18] <mar_krow> only the tip tho
[4:33:20] <SummonerMagno> do the same thing you did to Paiges butt
[4:33:20] <AllenDeadman> did anri just beat the FUCK out him?
[4:33:22] <%WhereIsWill> if he having this much trouble imagine midir NotLikeThis
[4:33:22] <+bugz_munny> THE EASIEST ATTACK
[4:33:22] <%YakumoYomi> I beat him with just the Candlestick's damage, and I was at a much lower level than Pat with a similar build
[4:33:25] <Shishi1205> You can use power within for your melee too
[4:33:25] <dinnydanny777> Do you have a magic resistant shield?
[4:33:28] <Shishi1205> and the weapon art
[4:33:30] <%mMayrro> yeah but they hurt because you're a baby mage with baby defense
[4:33:31] <jhonxiolonn> Ember, pat
[4:33:43] <+xXjuffelXx> Maybe some miracle?
[4:33:43] <%chambatron> Adrifting hitbox
[4:33:44] <%g0atmeal> Does aldrich even have an ass?
[4:33:46] <jhonxiolonn> Ah
[4:33:52] <$Afterman_> try soliare
[4:33:52] <dinnydanny777> All Aldrich is is an ass
[4:33:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeah you're a phantom
[4:33:53] <Zombrocom> He IS embered
[4:33:53] <Jontman42> Solaire?
[4:33:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Aldrich is all ass
[4:33:55] <%AncelDeLambert> HAVE to?
[4:33:56] <%edwardskacz> You can do it!
[4:33:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fire spells?
[4:34:00] <sendart> go buy some pyro
[4:34:03] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, because it's hers
[4:34:07] <%Aydarkzero> poor Anri
[4:34:10] <$lotharrio> Spit rocks!
[4:34:11] <+bugz_munny> Isnt there a ring for more phantom benefits?
[4:34:15] <Node_One> He can't summon le sun bro, he's being summoned into another world
[4:34:15] <yeetdabsenpai69> use fire spells?
[4:34:22] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck you SNAAAAAAKE
[4:34:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Off
[4:34:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> oof
[4:34:25] <$Afterman_> ah wanst sure if he could or nnot
[4:34:28] <$lotharrio> Spit rocks and summon Solaire!
[4:34:29] <dinnydanny777> Aldrich is 95% ass
[4:34:39] <@JustinianKnight> big badonk
[4:34:47] <+bugz_munny> easiest pattern ever pat i swear
[4:34:48] <mostundesired> Nice whiffs.
[4:34:49] <Jontman42> liquid ass
[4:34:52] <+bugz_munny> you better be able to do this
[4:34:53] <%g0atmeal> Man Gwyndolin just can't catch a break huh
[4:34:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Touch the slimy tail
[4:35:02] <Shishi1205> Try summoning Solaire @PatStaresAt
[4:35:03] <mar_krow> spank that ass leech
[4:35:10] <%Taisuru> So is yours pat be nice
[4:35:11] <%AncelDeLambert> oh yeah, this is basically the anti-Pat fight, isn't it? Huge magic defense
[4:35:13] <@JustinianKnight> yes
[4:35:17] <@JustinianKnight> it chases you
[4:35:18] <%Aydarkzero> magic arrows btw LUL
[4:35:18] <+masarusasaki> ngl I expected aldritch to be larger from the trailer considering he oozes out from a big tomb
[4:35:19] <jhonxiolonn> Rip Estus
[4:35:21] <+bugz_munny> That move has insane tracking on Phase 2
[4:35:25] <%Starotter70> Gotta go now, have a nice night Pat & Chat! KonCha
[4:35:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> is he resistant to sorcery or miracles because of Gwyndolin?
[4:35:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Admiral_PopnFresh yes
[4:35:40] <%AncelDeLambert> how is this asshole's fire resistance?
[4:35:42] <jhonxiolonn> PAt, use your fireballs
[4:35:46] <LordOfThePoultry> DansGame
[4:35:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I wonder if Aldrich was scaled down in size in development
[4:35:52] <@JustinianKnight> there ya go
[4:35:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Admiral_PopnFresh and Dark because aldrich is dark
[4:35:59] <Shishi1205> Spells do low dmg
[4:36:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I was wondering why Pat was going for physical damage
[4:36:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @doc_ock_rokc thanks
[4:36:12] <+xXjuffelXx> @Admiral_PopnFresh only sorcery, actually weak to miracles
[4:36:12] <%AncelDeLambert> not looking forward to this fight with my faith build
[4:36:18] <@JustinianKnight> well
[4:36:19] <%Agami23> pat did you get the fecal explosion pyromancy? if not you missed it
[4:36:22] <%chambatron> AngriestPat would have beat this first try without Anri
[4:36:23] <Vohs_Bru> Oh no Dank Souls
[4:36:24] <+taltalheights> Worth two handed swinging?
[4:36:24] <classypigeon234> use fire coward
[4:36:29] <%mMayrro> just get one of them magic parry shields Kappa
[4:36:29] <AllenDeadman> good hits in
[4:36:34] <$RealThiele> goo'd
[4:36:34] <jhonxiolonn> Try to 2 hand so you do more poise damage
[4:36:36] <dinnydanny777> Can you use Miracles?
[4:36:40] <%Aydarkzero> how could you leave Anri alone FeelsBadMan
[4:36:41] <yeetdabsenpai69> pyromanvy?
[4:36:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Lightning resist on Aldrich is 20% I believe
[4:36:51] <%AncelDeLambert> I believe Pat has focused on Intelligence for his build
[4:36:56] <jhonxiolonn> BABY
[4:36:58] <+bugz_munny> be careful on phase 2 with the arrows, they track harder
[4:36:59] <@JustinianKnight> just...dodge things
[4:37:09] <AllenDeadman> just don't get hit 4Head
[4:37:09] <+masarusasaki> just don't die 4Head
[4:37:10] <%mMayrro> just don't take damage 4Head
[4:37:14] <%Aydarkzero> psaBig BUFF
[4:37:17] <Shishi1205> How much does fully buffed boulder do?
[4:37:18] <+xXjuffelXx> Miracles get a boost against Aldrich because he is on water
[4:37:21] <%g0atmeal> chat is in sync lol
[4:37:28] <%Nickmobox> Works for me psaSmug
[4:37:37] <+Rhan_> pat u missed the coprolite combustion pyromancy in scrungo's antechamber
[4:37:38] <Augus7717> Just win 4Head
[4:37:39] <$RealThiele> bye bye bye
[4:37:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ah, did not realize the floor counted as water here
[4:37:47] <@JustinianKnight> Pat too used to big poise boy build that eats everything I think
[4:37:54] <jhonxiolonn> yes
[4:37:58] <%TheWinged7> mortis
[4:38:05] <Shishi1205> the one that follows you is not a cone
[4:38:08] <AllenDeadman> yes, the phase 2 arrows track you
[4:38:12] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you should be able to scale Pyromancy just fine
[4:38:20] <%YakumoYomi> Aldritch has 20% resistance for Magic and Lightning, 40% for Dark, and 0% for Fire
[4:38:21] <%BoneofMalkav> Mortis! [Duuuunn!] psaSkelmo
[4:38:25] <jhonxiolonn> Come on pat, you can do it
[4:38:30] <%g0atmeal> Just let Paige do it for you
[4:38:33] <dinnydanny777> Anri is so much stronger than you
[4:38:39] <+xXjuffelXx> @Valentinius_Anodyne yeah, Gnaw the Void gets him good in Vanilla
[4:38:47] <%TheWinged7> SO hows Paige doing today gang? any plans for more streams yet?
[4:38:47] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL totally, just put the controller in Paige's hands
[4:39:00] <%AncelDeLambert> legit we have learned at this point that she trolls over anything Pat has trouble with
[4:39:02] <Shishi1205> it is kinda worth
[4:39:03] <%Taisuru> Bring pyromancy pat...
[4:39:05] <+Invlux> Is Aldritch susceptible to Poison or Toxic?
[4:39:13] <@JustinianKnight> damage is damage
[4:39:15] <jhonxiolonn> but beware of anri
[4:39:15] <+Micalica> MORE DAKKA
[4:39:26] <Shishi1205> poise dmg too
[4:39:28] <dinnydanny777> same damage as sword
[4:39:44] <@JustinianKnight> the power of cheese
[4:39:48] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, but... hit him while the FP regens
[4:39:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Looks like Aldrich is fairly vulnerable to Frost actually
[4:39:54] <AllenDeadman> why not use the magic sword spell on the butt? because the tracking spell attacks gwyndolin's corpse
[4:39:58] <Vohs_Bru> Soul Wars
[4:40:01] <jhonxiolonn> RUN
[4:40:04] <j0ustar> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese SeemsGood
[4:40:05] <%AncelDeLambert> god I wish I had something similar from miracles that I could spam like this
[4:40:05] <mostundesired> You're doing as much or more damage as if you did the melee attack.
[4:40:08] <Reanimator83> I was wondering why he wasn‚Äôt using that spell LUL
[4:40:13] <jhonxiolonn> ir Keeps for a long time
[4:40:13] <+bugz_munny> BORFD
[4:40:14] <%g0atmeal> Imagine Aldrich trying to sit on his throne
[4:40:16] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[4:40:16] <%ECRead> that FP gauge is comically large
[4:40:17] <@JustinianKnight> justin92NoxusFace
[4:40:21] <Vohs_Bru> da Deadly Arrows from the sky
[4:40:25] <Shishi1205> Chat the tracking spell aldritch does is not available for players right?
[4:40:25] <$lotharrio> He fooled you.
[4:40:25] <mar_krow> lol u did good tho
[4:40:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @AncelDeLambert I mostly just use Lightning Arrow for spell spam, but yeah I hear ya
[4:40:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Dark dance does the WotG animation, right? why would you make a Pursuers like magic have a faster cast rate? NotLikeThis
[4:40:40] <%BubbaRands> That was pretty cool tho
[4:40:40] <Shishi1205> The purple fireflights
[4:40:44] <%heartlesshealer> good luck
[4:40:45] <@Pandora_Prime> just parry every single individual arrow.
[4:40:47] <Vohs_Bru> Just do the Fred
[4:40:47] <+oda_flobunaga> try digging up
[4:40:50] <jhonxiolonn> nerf dark dance
[4:40:58] <%TheWinged7> this is where we need woolie singing "somebodies getting fucked"
[4:41:04] <AllenDeadman> this is actualy good practice for the actual fight
[4:41:09] <AllenDeadman> some good warmup
[4:41:16] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> both NL and GDQ are streaming DS
[4:41:38] <dinnydanny777> Aldrich's spells look like fireworks
[4:41:39] <%chambatron> angy
[4:41:40] <@JustinianKnight> his swings come out so slow
[4:41:46] <Shishi1205> Does affinity do anything vs him for the dark reduction?
[4:41:57] <+bugz_munny> That's his weakness
[4:41:58] <mostundesired> Note to self, magic users are better off using magic.
[4:42:00] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> how come the snakey boi is so beefy?
[4:42:02] <@JustinianKnight> gross wormman
[4:42:05] <%AncelDeLambert> how the FUCK does Dark Dance have such a low cast time?
[4:42:07] <%Maids4lyfe> it's almost like he ate a bunch of them Kappa
[4:42:08] <%xcompleasedad> Cause he murdered them all
[4:42:09] <rekinom> Considering he ate them, he literally is
[4:42:12] <ChokeOnMyChicken> why is this BOOMER STREAMER playing this OLD game again
[4:42:13] <+BSplitz> has he ascended the candlestick yet?
[4:42:14] <jhonxiolonn> run
[4:42:14] <@Pandora_Prime> So Aldritch is the DS1 Chosen Undead right
[4:42:16] <auspiciousdgg> Which bosses is he like in one?
[4:42:18] <%arcaderabbit48> Does that make him cool, or does that make him kinda limp?
[4:42:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> who else besides Nito and Gwyndolin did he eat?
[4:42:29] <dinnydanny777> Those arrows are just comical
[4:42:34] <%AncelDeLambert> WOAAAAAAAh
[4:42:36] <mostundesired> Oh god, Anri only does 28 damage.

[4:43:19] <mostundesired> Finish him, Anri!
[4:43:20] <%arcaderabbit48> Nito isn't even mentioned in this game, people just assume that's what the lower part of Aldritch is supposed to be. It could just be general slurry form the normal people he ate
[4:43:21] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> LOL
[4:43:21] <Vohs_Bru> HAH

[4:43:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt By the way, with the 1.75 changes, your enchanted candlestick is doing 10-20% less dark damage with spells than it would be if it was dark-infused.

[4:43:54] <%BudaBryan> FlipThis FlipThis

[4:44:05] <mar_krow> griffith seems like a tough boss
[4:44:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> Spell buff is less important
[4:44:08] <dinnydanny777> Try sorcery?
[4:44:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> >PAt's AC is now working
[4:44:11] <+StrawberryPantsu> Aw man
[4:44:14] <dinnydanny777> Try sorcery or fire?
[4:44:14] <%arcaderabbit48> @Zombrocom Wait, is he??
[4:44:19] <mostundesired> Nice.
[4:44:21] <auspiciousdgg> But Pat, you only use the spell buff 30% of the time?
[4:44:26] <Zombrocom> @arcaderabbit48 Yeah
[4:44:34] <+bugz_munny> Pat and elmo finally un-fused yeah
[4:44:37] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> run patrick boivin

[4:44:38] <%xcompleasedad> BASE
[4:44:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bugz_munny Now elmo in in control of the pat body
[4:44:53] <+SinisterBroccoli> @auspiciousdgg Spell buff is how much the tool boost your spells
[4:44:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You'd probably have to pump faith and you need your 40 int for spells
[4:44:57] <%BoneofMalkav> Infuse that with skeleton... because skeleton
[4:44:58] <%arcaderabbit48> @Zombrocom Okay cool. Now I'm extra sad that Nito isn't even mentioned in the game then, cause that's really cool.
[4:45:15] <Zombrocom> Because your faith is shit enchanted will be better
[4:45:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You think Aldrich ate Priscilla, given that you get the Lifehunt Talisman from him?
[4:45:19] <auspiciousdgg> @SinisterBroccoli I thought Spell Buff was the effect of the weapon art. My bad
[4:45:24] <DesertPenguin> Just got back from an hour or so of protest. What did I miss?
[4:45:27] <+SinisterBroccoli> TehePelo
[4:45:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> *Lifehunt Scythe
[4:45:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because your faith is garbage because this isn't a dark build
[4:45:33] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This will make your swings Dark, which might do worse against aldrich
[4:45:33] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Enchanted will be better because your faith is shit

[4:45:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> At this point magic would be better lol
[4:45:51] <%BoneofMalkav> Pat knows his Steiner Maths
[4:45:54] <sendart> use regular sorcery then you dofus
[4:45:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> damn commonwealthers put S on the end of math
[4:45:56] <Watoo22> 6*4=22
[4:45:56] <DesertPenguin> Well, I was out protesting so I'd say that was more the time of my life lol
[4:45:56] <%xcompleasedad> Are we allowed to judge OTHER maths?
[4:45:57] <+lion_oh> Why DS3 tho
[4:45:58] <jhonxiolonn> plus fp regen
[4:46:01] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Dark probably better with 40 faith, which Pat doesn't have
[4:46:02] <%arcielardor> Patrick"The Munchkin" Boivin
[4:46:03] <+bugz_munny> Whats his Faith/Int spread?
[4:46:03] <mostundesired> Nice.
[4:46:08] <j0ustar> NotLikeThis SeemsGood
[4:46:09] <DesertPenguin> If you go out to protest, bring a bicycle. Your legs will thank you
[4:46:12] <mostundesired> Counter damage?
[4:46:12] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> biggER damage
[4:46:13] <+bassforte123> @arcaderabbit48 The whole boss fight is a bit of a throw back because Alderich has been eating the previous lords. Gwyndolyn's the most ovious, but he's covered in Nito fuzz
[4:46:14] <+bugz_munny> Counter damage
[4:46:16] <classypigeon234> use fire for real
[4:46:21] <Reanimator83> The goblins know math
[4:46:25] <Saltyjub> It's the Adventures of Pat, with his massive Hat! Trudging along to this stupid song! Midmaxin' away, will make you shout "Hooray"! It's the adventures of Undead Pat
[4:46:32] <darcfowler1995> Yo Big mafffffff
[4:46:37] <+bugz_munny> YOU DONT PAY MY SUB
[4:46:38] <%WhereIsWill> FORREAL?!
[4:46:39] <sendart> pat wants to be bad and not optimal
[4:46:40] <%Maids4lyfe> your way isn't doing very well
[4:46:43] <%Meltdown547> That sounds like Woolie talk.
[4:46:44] <%xcompleasedad> Three hours later......
[4:46:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> by dying on the A in Aldrich
[4:46:45] <%LaughingCatt> use DAHKNESS & sowrd
[4:46:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Infuse torch, get fire torch
[4:46:48] <$lotharrio> So no rock spitting?
[4:46:50] <%AncelDeLambert> But Pat, the number gobolins
[4:46:51] <dinnydanny777> 2+2 is 4 quick maths
[4:46:53] <%Agami23> beat the boss with big stumbo power.
[4:46:55] <+walternatorz> but paaat YOUR way is not My way
[4:46:59] <Shishi1205> So Bloodborne PC rumors grow stronger today too huh?
[4:47:01] <%xcompleasedad> To be fair, you were a NUT HAIR from winning last time
[4:47:03] <%valriot> Ok Woolie
[4:47:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Yay it's Pat I'm Pat you're Pat he's Pat are there any other Pats I should know about
[4:47:12] <classypigeon234> DarkSydePat
[4:47:12] <mar_krow> cut down all the arrows as you run at him lol
[4:47:15] <j0ustar> He MUST use his dark cheese powers
[4:47:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Anri...
[4:47:19] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> doesnt climax reduce dark absorbtion
[4:47:22] <%Agami23> i wonder if you can poison aldritch. because im wanting to do a pyro build with the fecal explosion pyromancy
[4:47:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @bassforte123 I just wish the game put a bit more emphasis on the Nito part too. The Gwyndolin aspect dominates this fight, but Nito is literally never mentioned by name in this game. Also brings up the quesiton of how he ate Nito if we killed him in the first game, but DS3 cares little for such things
[4:47:26] <%cylish> Member when everyone was screaming about being OP
[4:47:30] <$lotharrio> Pat, noooo. Get simpy for number go up!
[4:47:31] <Zombrocom> Bloodborne PC will never happen
[4:47:40] <%AncelDeLambert> this boss is such a weird amalgam of Dark Souls 1. He's even got Nito's sword on his staff
[4:47:40] <%Maids4lyfe> nice now just keep dodging like that
[4:47:41] <%WhereIsWill> hey @PatStaresAt what NPC got the worst deal outta everyone in dark souls?
[4:47:46] <%xcompleasedad> @arcaderabbit48 Maybe he just stole it?
[4:47:48] <classypigeon234> @cylish he would be op if he was using fire
[4:47:48] <Sogeki_Dan> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese
[4:47:50] <$lotharrio> Are PC players still frothing for Bloodborne?
[4:47:50] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> STUMBO WAY
[4:47:52] <DesertPenguin> Woolie's stream isn't up yet. Did he say anything?
[4:47:55] <srkAres> isnt that also the plague qay
[4:47:56] <tolloponik> pelvic thrust to victory
[4:47:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> God job, spell
[4:47:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Can aldrich be effected by curse?
[4:48:00] <srkAres> *way
[4:48:01] <classypigeon234> @lotharrio yes
[4:48:03] <%Aydarkzero> @AncelDeLambert huh, never noticed that
[4:48:05] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @lotharrio yes, frothing in the loins
[4:48:08] <+bassforte123> @arcaderabbit48 Oh for sure. It's WILD how little the LORD OF DEATH gets mentioned in a series about constant horrible rebirths
[4:48:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Agami23 It appears Aldrich has real high resist to all statuses but Frost
[4:48:10] <@JustinianKnight> some somewhat credible rumors about Bloodborne PC goin on today
[4:48:15] <@JustinianKnight> but who knows
[4:48:17] <segychan> YEAH HOW DO YOU LIKE IT
[4:48:17] <%Agami23> damn
[4:48:27] <Zombrocom> @arcaderabbit48 The pretend justification is Other Worlds/timelines. The REAL justification is "Because it's COOL!" LUL
[4:48:28] <Augus7717> f
[4:48:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I'll believe Bloodborne PC when I see it
[4:48:34] <mostundesired> He says spamming projectiles.
[4:48:36] <dinnydanny777> Aldrich is now cheesing you
[4:48:37] <%AncelDeLambert> don't tease us like that, Justinian
[4:48:41] <+bugz_munny> Pat get in his butthole
[4:48:42] <mar_krow> knock down and arrows still raining on him
[4:48:43] <$lotharrio> But Sony has no incentive to put it on PC, and they own the propety, right?
[4:48:43] <dinnydanny777> Aldrich is cheesing
[4:48:51] <jhonxiolonn> so close
[4:48:53] <@JustinianKnight> I also don't truly believe anything til I see it
[4:49:00] <%Maids4lyfe> wouldn't it be funny if Aldritch could be hit by his own arrows?
[4:49:02] <%arcaderabbit48> Does that arrow attack last longer in Cinders? That's a lot of arrows
[4:49:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JustinianKnight don't get my hopes up
[4:49:08] <@JustinianKnight> more money is the incentive
[4:49:10] <%SirGO0SE> whats good ya'll? nice to see my beautiful boivin boy has his ac fixed
[4:49:11] <jhonxiolonn> UHOH
[4:49:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 2 more
[4:49:14] <+bugz_munny> You want Ald throwing out his slow dumb melee attacks, not his fast AF spells
[4:49:18] <%Maids4lyfe> nah that's the normal amount of arrows
[4:49:22] <Zombrocom> Those are vanilla arrows
[4:49:24] <dinnydanny777> That totally hit you lol
[4:49:26] <mostundesired> Yeyeyeyeye
[4:49:29] <@JustinianKnight> justin92YouDidIt

[4:49:34] <nilla_24> nice
[4:49:34] <+bassforte123> I think the arrows are just a straight line in phase 1 but Cindered Mode arrows track you longer
[4:49:34] <+OhioNitsud> psaDab
[4:49:36] <%AncelDeLambert> You.... did it
[4:49:36] <%chambatron> Get in there Gootecks! PogChamp

[4:49:40] <j0ustar> GG EZ

[4:49:49] <jhonxiolonn> cute
[4:49:50] <+bugz_munny> and then she dies
[4:49:50] <classypigeon234> now he just needs to beat it for real in his world
[4:49:51] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Cleric Candlestick spellbuff scales well early, but is surpassed by other catalysts later. For a while I kept a lightning and a holy one for my miracle build.
[4:49:51] <@JustinianKnight> 1st try
[4:49:53] <%AncelDeLambert> yaaaay
[4:49:55] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> wait, did he retrieve his ousl?
[4:49:56] <$lotharrio> Right but they never put Demon Souls on PC, and that's the exact same deal.
[4:49:56] <mostundesired> What's Pat's stats at, out of curiosity?
[4:49:57] <+taltalheights> First try

[4:50:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Anri's cool when you don't murder them to become King of the Undead
[4:50:11] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @mostundesired that's the name of the stream

[4:52:24] <dinnydanny777> He kind of looks like the weird monsters from DS2
[4:52:24] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> Pat has become the dark souls equivalent of Teemo
[4:52:30] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @BudaBryan he is a peepee cat

[4:52:50] <acrobaticballerina> @RowenCleric i never played ds3 but yooo, it's really just anor londo
[4:52:55] <acrobaticballerina> they did it again
[4:52:56] <dinnydanny777> Dark Dance is basically Armored Core missiles
[4:52:57] <%AncelDeLambert> man, the deacon fight is AWFUL with miracles
[4:53:00] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> do the archdeacons leave if you kill aldrich?

[4:54:59] <cosmictrashcan> aldrich is so annoying
[4:54:59] <%arcaderabbit48> As many problems as I have with Aldritch, I do really like the idea of "what if we redid the Gwyndolin fight and made it (less) shit?"
[4:55:01] <+OhioNitsud> who has the stinkier cheese?
[4:55:02] <dinnydanny777> Bullet hell bos

[4:56:52] <%AncelDeLambert> guys, you all watched Woolie kill her.
[4:56:54] <%AncelDeLambert> like the monster he is
[4:56:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> First step to becoming Devourer of the Gods is to become a cannibal, an easy task if you aren't a coward B)
[4:56:57] <Calek> are all the lords dead now?
[4:56:59] <mostundesired> Mod didn't bring back the tiddies, shit mod 0/10.
[4:57:01] <jhonxiolonn> Oh, Aldritch magic
[4:57:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> The more I think about it, the more I realize Pat's just doing a sorc build but using hexes.
[4:57:03] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> how do you get rosarias soul again?
[4:57:04] <%g0atmeal> Isn't Gwynevere theorized to be the queen of Londor?
[4:57:14] <%g0atmeal> If so she's really got a thing for dragons...

[4:57:22] <%xcompleasedad> "Bros"
[4:57:23] <dinnydanny777> Did we kind of fuck things up by killing the Lords of everything?
[4:57:25] <+WutangchickeN> hooray the gutses
[4:57:26] <LordOfThePoultry> DansGame

[4:57:31] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> pat what's your problem
[4:57:33] <%maenos2> can't stain the throne
[4:57:39] <%Aydarkzero> @g0atmeal i thought she left w/ the Flame Hiede Guy from dks2
[4:57:40] <personmanthingg> i thought those were his priest robes?
[4:57:42] <$lotharrio> Don't want him dripping.
[4:57:44] <AllenDeadman> did you kill yhorm already?
[4:57:44] <%dekkitout> Before the tarp, they had to hose down the thrown after he got off
[4:57:45] <%xxshadowxx416> pat and chat would you like a mmo that played like dark souls
[4:57:45] <Calek> @dinnydanny777 the lords weren't doing their job, so we're forcing them to
[4:57:47] <Kipss> i legit never noticed the tarp
[4:57:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoRB
[4:57:53] <+OhioNitsud> @Ynkubus18 i was thinking DoG but Dev is cooler for sure
[4:57:55] <personmanthingg> no
[4:57:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's weird that Ludleth is just one of them
[4:58:01] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> But he's okay with his deal
[4:58:02] <%mMayrro> beeg
[4:58:04] <%Aydarkzero> @xxshadowxx416 yes but i prob wouldn't be insterested in the pvp
[4:58:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Lothric Castle is super doable early in this, I ended up clearing it up to Dragonslayer Armor before Abyss Watchers
[4:58:07] <+wydamn> @xxshadowxx416 I would, but it would need good netcode
[4:58:08] <dinnydanny777> Is Ludleth secretly a badass
[4:58:13] <jhonxiolonn> time for the scythe
[4:58:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @xxshadowxx416 not really
[4:58:16] <auspiciousdgg> How long did it take you guys to notice Gwynevere has a mole on her right tiddy. It took me 5 hours of research.
[4:58:18] <%AncelDeLambert> well, Ludleth was the first, so it was a different deal for him
[4:58:20] <%TheWinged7> @xxshadowxx416 i feeel like i would, but i dont think it would work
[4:58:23] <Monkeyweed21> Thats wrong Pat
[4:58:28] <%mMayrro> fuck ludleth he has no feet
[4:58:29] <%g0atmeal> You can't just say the P word like that
[4:58:30] <Zombrocom> Ludleth is a good fellow
[4:58:31] <rekinom> big wrong
[4:58:33] <dinnydanny777> If you could fight Ludleth would he just kick your ass
[4:58:35] <@JustinianKnight> hes not
[4:58:36] <DesertPenguin> Oh is he?
[4:58:36] <+Ankation> Ludleth ain't ok with it, you hear if you kill him
[4:58:37] <AllenDeadman> you can fins hollow anri now
[4:58:40] <AllenDeadman> find
[4:58:41] <DesertPenguin> Is HE the furtive pygmy?!
[4:58:43] <Monkeyweed21> He's not a pygmy he's just burnt
[4:58:45] <Shishi1205> I dont think he is a pigmy
[4:58:46] <%AncelDeLambert> GIMME THE SCYTHEEEEEEE
[4:58:51] <+pittbulldogg> LOL @PatStaresAt bethesda is trending......
[4:58:52] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> He's not thrilled with it, but he's ok
[4:58:52] <Shishi1205> He is just maimed
[4:58:56] <The_Grand_J> probably a lad from the ringed city yeah
[4:58:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I want the scythe so bad, fuck you game
[4:58:58] <j0ustar> Orb of Judgement? Sounds like Pat's special bedroom move
[4:59:02] <DesertPenguin> The actual lifehunt scythe or the spell version?
[4:59:02] <SummonerMagno> orb
[4:59:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ludleth turned himself into a Lord of Cinder through pure will, he's the biggest and strongest
[4:59:06] <%dekkitout> Oh no
[4:59:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ludleth is the only reason we have the current itteration, He sacrificed himself to prevent the dark void
[4:59:07] <%thelonechris> Oh no
[4:59:08] <mostundesired> Why?
[4:59:08] <%AncelDeLambert> spell version

[4:59:23] <DesertPenguin> Because they did a bad
[4:59:26] <+Promessa_EX> yeah just a lame city
[4:59:27] <%Aydarkzero> i don't think it's the Company Pat LUL
[4:59:27] <rekinom> They changed their logo to a pride month one, except on their middle east account
[4:59:28] <Gallhint> bethesda middle east probably
[4:59:32] <%maenos2> it looks to be about Bethesda MD not the company
[4:59:34] <%mMayrro> oh so not bethany esda?
[4:59:35] <DesertPenguin> They stand with everyone but their Middle East account doesn't
[4:59:35] <%Aydarkzero> i'm close to that!
[4:59:35] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt All Bethesda social accounts adopted a pride flag, but the Middle East
[4:59:36] <%dekkitout> False alarm?
[4:59:37] <%g0atmeal> Was Todd Howard caught looting?
[4:59:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Aren't the "pygmies", or at least the Furtive Pygmy, actually pretty tall?
[4:59:43] <+pittbulldogg> the entire town of bethesda.......
[4:59:47] <DesertPenguin> Their Middle East social account

[5:00:28] <%g0atmeal> Pride flags only apply when you get good PR for them apparently
[5:00:30] <DesertPenguin> Perfect timing
[5:00:44] <DesertPenguin> It's not about PR, it's about folding to Middle Eastern beliefs
[5:00:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> What happened to AMD?
[5:00:47] <DesertPenguin> Instead of standing strong

[5:02:00] <+Promessa_EX> alduin was gay
[5:02:54] <%maenos2> bad dragon
[5:03:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I feel liek overwatch having some of their charcaters as gay was a PR move. Like tracer is gay everywhere but not Soldier?

[5:03:53] <%YakumoYomi> @TurtlesAndTentacles The Soldier 76 stuff came out suspiciously close to when Overwatch was having that "Ellie" scandal.
[5:03:54] <+Promessa_EX> @wydamn but do we have bad dragon alduin mods yet?
[5:03:56] <%maenos2> i mean alduin eats people so not too far off in the grand scheme of things

[5:07:17] <j0ustar> yes
[5:07:19] <%Agami23> sea of theeves is also a big "play it with friends and make your own fun"
[5:07:19] <+Nekuhh> Sea of Thieves is fine Solo, any game is great with friends . just got and unfortunate roll with getting attacked outright
[5:07:19] <koolkatdq> you should play dragon quest 10
[5:07:21] <+wydamn> Sea of thieves is not fun without friends, and there's no crew matchmaking afaik
[5:07:22] <Monkeyweed21> it doesnt use the store

[5:08:04] <%Your_heals> I started and stopped the Xbox game pass in under 20 days, just not enough games worth the money imo
[5:08:06] <+Nekuhh> If you do try Sea of Thieves again, do The Mayden Voyage its the games tutorial. If not atleast you tried no?
[5:08:08] <laserbeaming> The Microsoft Store is not as much of a problem as the Universal Windows App bullshi

[5:09:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> white people
[5:09:08] <$Dakuu75> pick it up and smear it on her. then say, "is it your problem now?"
[5:09:11] <%BubbaRands> HAND THAT MOM A MOP
[5:09:12] <zamzoph> I think the argument is more to do with who's responsible for cleaning the mess on the floor: the lady or janitorial
[5:09:13] <%kknutson4> The Xbox game pass app is not the same as the Windows store
