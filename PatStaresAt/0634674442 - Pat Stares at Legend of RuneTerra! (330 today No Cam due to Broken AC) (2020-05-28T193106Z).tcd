[0:05:51] <$heyitskevin> @FacetiousAF Yes
[0:05:53] <Daxalog> I wish the did what MTG Arena did where you picked the starter decks you wanted. The 3 runeterra gave are lame as shit
[0:06:02] <SulfurousAcid> pat would not have physical cards, that would mean he'd have to go outside. he'd defo be a mtga player

[0:23:44] <%Garthunox> pat it's very simple

[0:23:46] <crimsonsaens> LUL
[0:23:46] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt A deck tracker tells you what cards you've drawn
[0:23:47] <%heartlesshealer> Just pick a single mechanic and build on it
[0:23:49] <%Bailey__gaming> haha I tried
[0:23:52] <1matheuw> how do?
[0:23:52] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt The point of an in-game deck tracker is to keep track of what you've drawn and whats still in your deck
[0:23:54] <%President_Miyazaki> So you know what cards are still in your deck
[0:23:59] <plusultrachef> braum and Vladimir 2nd best
[0:24:02] <+glgzephyr> ***
[0:24:04] <$milhousego> is this the game that Pat made the funny tweet about?
[0:24:07] <+glgzephyr> FOLLOW THIIS LINK
[0:24:07] <%Ninestempest> pat, most videos or articles about decks have a long code that you literally copy and paste into the game and it just generates the deck. if you don't have the cards, it's make the deck and disable it from play @patstaresat
[0:24:12] <%Garthunox> pat did you google anything?
[0:24:12] <Camail> WE?
[0:24:13] <Personified134> a program can't tell you how to deckbuild pat, sorry

[0:24:23] <plusultrachef> what cards do you have
[0:24:24] <redial_nick> just use brain to build deck 4Head
[0:24:25] <Louie_Salmon> Just grab someone's budget deck code, then replace what you don't have
[0:24:30] <JustAnotherMuffin> @mikizi Don't shit on Net Deckers some people just prefer getting better at playing a deck and don't get enjoyment from brewing
[0:24:30] <+Midashu> Pat wants a program to play the game foooor him
[0:24:32] <1matheuw> just make a shroom meme deck is superfun

[0:24:46] <MartiusGW> burn is cheap deck
[0:24:46] <%heartlesshealer> You click the thing, then click the other thing, repeat until you would like to click the confirm thing.
[0:24:46] <%hermitsen> that's what wildcards are for
[0:24:50] <+SparrowHW> look for starter decks?
[0:24:50] <+blurblewurble> craft them it's real cheap
[0:24:50] <%Frost_Quill> Is this game anything like Yu-Gi-Oh or Gwent? Those are literally the only card games I know how to play with any level of competency.
[0:24:52] <negaswarmlord> Well you can't do much about that
[0:24:52] <+glgzephyr> get cards, then you can build good decks

[0:25:00] <%Agami23> you need to get the cards. thats how gachas work
[0:25:01] <+klassikFrank> If you don 't have cards, then does it really matter what deck you wanna make
[0:25:02] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt where did you put the guy's deck in at?
[0:25:03] <%AnIrishPapaya> You kind of have to grind with the starters
[0:25:03] <%Garthunox> then just play the game till you get the cards

[0:25:11] <nurkacyi> how does a/c impact the cam?
[0:25:15] <Louie_Salmon> The generic decks are actually pretty solid
[0:25:15] <%hermitsen> pick a deck that sounds fun and save up your wild cards until you can buy everything in it
[0:25:25] <plusultrachef> you gotta just play with a shit deck for 20 games then you'll earn enough cards to build a good deck

[0:27:34] <%crimsonharvest> eyes on the inside
[0:27:37] <%weissguard> Netdecking has more steps than just looking up a deck online. If you're a competent player, that is. You playtest and adjust the deck to your liking after looking it up. Not worth it for Pat atm.

[0:28:41] <%heartlesshealer> You guys actually watched it! <3
[0:28:42] <+MajorCrasher> it's not really netdecking anymore if you change it up to your liking imo. the idea of netdecking is making a carbon copy of a deck
[0:28:45] <%Starotter70> SPIDERS BROKE PAIGE'S BUTT

[0:29:15] <DefaultSettiings> dear god
[0:29:16] <%Jekado> Cheer500 Hey pat quick tip when making ice packs if you mix rubbing alcohol with the water when you freeze it. It turns it into a frozen gel pack. Makes it easier for Paige to use, and you don't have to smash the ice. I forget the ratio but you can look it up online. I made them before they are super helpful for sore muscles and the like.
[0:29:17] <%Svanyr> To be faaaaaaaaaair

[0:29:32] <%Ancopro> bye money but also bye spiders
[0:29:35] <%weissguard> TBF, you looking up the deck, make it, playtest it, then make adjustments if you want. That's what netdecking "properly" is.

[0:30:19] <%OldManDeckardCain> because Kaiba had a huge boner for dragons
[0:30:20] <%YakumoYomi> Not best, but it was a strong beatstick at the time.
[0:30:20] <MyNameIsRasus> YES BUT WHAT DOES IT DO
[0:30:20] <%Fenrirlives> KUNAI WITH CHAIN!
[0:30:20] <+glgzephyr> that is indeed what Pot of Greed does
[0:30:21] <Daebunz> dragon cool is why
[0:30:22] <Zombrocom> Pot of Greed has been banned for decades
[0:30:23] <%Frost_Quill> Blue Eyes White Dragon was literally Kaiba's actual spirit waifu.
[0:30:23] <%Ancopro> BUT IS THAT ALL?
[0:30:24] <stanlychicken> 3 cards
[0:30:25] <%Starotter70> And you use it to draw Pot Of Greed
[0:30:25] <%blaccbird914> Yu-Gi-Oh super complicated for no reason now

[0:30:30] <%spiritofmojave> Pot of Greed is a banned meme I thought LUL
[0:30:30] <cureneckbeard> That's not how it works!
[0:30:31] <+ALazo> It was literally only hyped in the show
[0:30:31] <CappuccinoGuil> Kaiba is a scalie, that's why
[0:30:32] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah pot of greed was broken for getting you free cards.
[0:30:32] <%Bailey__gaming> Jinzo was legit back at the day
[0:30:33] <+BeezusHrist> cool cat pic
[0:30:33] <%DaBigVitus> no one knows what it's like to be the bad man, to be the sad man. behind blue eyes white dragon.
[0:30:36] <DefaultSettiings> Dark Magician was garbage. 2 sacrifices for a 2500 LUL
[0:30:39] <ShichiNoBushi> I'm too spoiled on Magic because drawing two cards seems lame.
[0:30:41] <+neutralraff> Don't forget to synchro summon before your pendulum summon got it.
[0:30:41] <SilentEric> mogwaiTeemo mogwaiTeemo mogwaiTeemo
[0:30:42] <%heartlesshealer> I always liked that 8 star crystal dragon with 2800 defense
[0:30:42] <%Frost_Quill> It lets you draw two cards for free.
[0:30:43] <derap41> I summon Pot of Greed Which allows me to draw to additional cards! Greed is Good
[0:30:45] <NiktenKing> LUL

[0:31:18] <@SoFarFetched> @ShichiNoBushi yeah I Think YGO doesn't have many cards that draw,think it's mostly triggers or effects on the battlefield.
[0:31:18] <%DocChutney> that is indeed what happens when you dont play the good ones
[0:31:21] <+Evitron1> freddy the 13th
[0:31:21] <%spiritofmojave> SICK
[0:31:21] <ShichiNoBushi> That's just Death 13.

[0:32:20] <%weissguard> @Frost_Quill Synchro summoning is addition between a tuner monster and non-tuner monsters. (level 3 tuner + non-tuner lever 4 = level 7 synchro.)

[0:32:41] <%Dementedpenguin> Thanks, Microsoft. 4Head
[0:32:43] <%Mendin> In the early anime, there was literally only 3 Blue Eyes in existance also you could play them without sacrificing monsters so their Power Was Maximum cause rules didnt exist
[0:32:44] <$Chatterbox1991> Worse than Games for Windows Live?
[0:32:45] <%heartlesshealer> Windows app store KILLS EVERYTHING. I still blame Fable 3 dying on it
[0:32:45] <%Taisuru> It's weird though, cause the Xbox app is WAY better
[0:32:46] <+glgzephyr> you KNOW they turn off the stream and fuck right on the couch
[0:32:46] <scrublord009> Windows Store is a fuck
[0:32:49] <+neutralraff> Will this be the return of the batwing?
[0:32:50] <+D00msDayDan> pso2 is the only game i've heard of that has problems on the windows store, but also that app is BAD

[0:34:30] <j0ustar> Honestly I've had no issues with PSO2 or the windows store other than its slowness so far but yeah the windows store needs work.
[0:34:41] <%Jekado> PSO2 lobby is a disaster though

[0:34:48] <%DaBigVitus> Orbs are fairly common in games. ruined now
[0:34:53] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah unfortunately the PSO2 is either you were fucked trying to download it,or someone had a good time trying to download it.
[0:34:55] <%crimsonharvest> its already done
[0:34:57] <+MacBeyer> PSO2 servers were dying super hard last night, probably going to get bag again tonight, literally they were overfull with people. For some reason they didn't open any new ones.

[0:36:14] <%gespenst25> You can apparently download the Japanese version and change a line in the .ini from jp to na :P
[0:36:16] <%Jekado> @JD_Lars yeah i'm not sure probably is getting a person to actually show up during these times too
[0:36:17] <%crimsonharvest> I played one game on the windows app store and it worked alright but it was an indie joint and they seemed competent not like fuckin Sega

[0:36:30] <+CelioHogane> JUST PLAY LEGENDS OF RUNATERRA
[0:36:33] <%Frost_Quill> I played the PSO2 Japanese beta or whatever that was. There was a specific server the English-speaking people played on and all we did was sync dance in a massive crowd.
[0:36:35] <TomFrank> i wish we could see pats profusely sweating glands
[0:36:38] <%BubbaRands> You waited 8 years for it! HERE'S MORE BULLSHIT

[0:53:16] <+MoonObscure> LUL
[0:53:16] <$Tuskor13> Elise has minor gremlin energy honestly
[0:53:17] <+CptCreampuff16> my cat is named after her
[0:53:18] <%spiritofmojave> Wench bot
[0:53:20] <+pectusumbra> That is a completely fair description
[0:53:21] <%Conyst> ooh spider
[0:53:25] <SilentEric> Wrenchbot has wrench hands

[0:53:33] <Chaossheep> I also read wenchbot
[0:53:37] <+ALazo> Spoder
[0:53:42] <%AnIrishPapaya> Pat, make sure you select the fraction you want cards from before you start doing the other tutorials. That way you get the xp buff where you need it
[0:53:45] <%Conyst> cute spider
[0:53:48] <SilentEric> Eight legs to step on you with
[0:53:50] <%Typhaeon> Evelynn clearly
[0:53:52] <depressedpepega> say it with me chat SWEATY BASEMENT ORB

[0:54:07] <%huskarl_zap> psaCrazyhand psaBig psaWrong
[0:54:18] <$Tuskor13> Honestly I think Evelynn looks better in her art than in game because the lighting on her art makes her look way more blue than she really is
[0:54:38] <+lethallylactic> nice
[0:54:51] <PKHTjim> main phase 2.
[0:54:55] <+CptCreampuff16> Elise is better she has more legs
[0:55:04] <$Tuskor13> I aint into bugs
[0:55:07] <%dekkitout> What is a herd of spiders called? A ball of yarn?
[0:55:16] <$Tuskor13> A herd of spiders is called a nightmare
[0:55:21] <+LokimenD> Is Pat teaching Paige how to play?
[0:55:22] <%dekkitout> Neat!
[0:55:23] <Kalcom> porobot when
[0:55:32] <+Vancoolness> All the bass frequency are gone on pats voice due to the rtx
[0:55:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Died super hard
[0:55:42] <+masarusasaki> doesnt elise make spiders have challenger ?
[0:55:44] <+pectusumbra> The lore is Elise worships a big spider and has a cult to feed people to it to stay an immortal hot spider bitch
[0:55:49] <%Conyst> a cuter spider
[0:55:51] <PKHTjim> Ded
[0:56:01] <$Tuskor13> Isn't the spider she worships the boss monster in the map they removed
[0:56:14] <SilentEric> "Bug" list? I see what they did there.
[0:56:14] <%heartlesshealer> pat losing units he doesn't need to in the tutorial
[0:56:16] <%dekkitout> @pectusumbra Does the spider power let her make cute sweaters?
[0:56:19] <MyNameIsRasus> @pectusumbra she's living her best life
[0:56:22] <Sayer_Raider> Yeah. The spider god is in this game, too, as a card
[0:56:23] <+OwlLightningMage> This game looks fun. Riot got me on one
[0:56:28] <+lethallylactic> so-
[0:56:30] <Sayer_Raider> You use a Magic card to summon it if 3 units die in a single round
[0:56:34] <+KilogramHours> THAT WASNT SO-

[0:56:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> This one actually doesn't look half bad maybe
[0:56:47] <+democrazyyy> it's not a direct ripoff of hearthstone like I thought it'd be
[0:56:48] <SilentEric> I feel like Peach won't like Lux
[0:56:51] <Kalcom> a spider
[0:56:51] <Sayer_Raider> I'm not shitting you, that's the official name
[0:56:54] <j0ustar> Paige says magic is for losers

[0:57:22] <%Treuan> It's okay, it's step. Not weird at all that way
[0:57:24] <Sayer_Raider> "Does she fuck her brother?" Pat, stop projecting your love relationship with Paige into this game
[0:57:24] <+malacante> no fast spells are fast
[0:57:25] <SoushinSen> Pot of Greed
[0:57:26] <%ghostofsolomon> no these are just cards, they can't fuck
[0:57:29] <mirainousagi> She fucks the magic hobbo criminal
[0:57:32] <+OwlLightningMage> POT OF GREED

[0:57:50] <stanlychicken> both she and her brother fuck criminals
[0:57:51] <NiktenKing> She is shipped with Ezreal
[0:57:54] <+KilogramHours> @PatStaresAt It only lasts one round though
[0:57:57] <crimsonsaens> This is pre-rework Lux too
[0:57:58] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @KilogramHours who the fuck is Sylas? I thought Lux and Ezreal were like canon bf/gf
[0:58:02] <+EndgameContent> ONCE
[0:58:03] <$Tuskor13> Lux x Ezreal is unfortunately canon
[0:58:03] <SilentEric> Also click the eye to see the full art!
[0:58:05] <Robot_Nixon_> CoolStoryBob
[0:58:07] <%Typhaeon> Lord Zed sure got a lot lamer after Power Rangers
[0:58:07] <%AnIrishPapaya> Fuck zed. Hate facing him
[0:58:10] <SilentEric> The art is really good
[0:58:10] <Sayer_Raider> Ezreal has a crush on Lux, but she doesn't remember him
[0:58:11] <%toastybites> was that noob saibot
[0:58:12] <+KilogramHours> @Bane_Kaikyo Lux doesn't even know who Ezreal is
[0:58:14] <+CelioHogane> @Tuskor13 is "ehhh" canon
[0:58:19] <%dekkitout> @Typhaeon I was thinking the same thing
[0:58:19] <+CptCreampuff16> lux and ez is canon only in the academia universe
[0:58:20] <Sayer_Raider> Their interactions in this game are basically "I don't even know who you are"
[0:58:22] <$Tuskor13> It's """canon""" canon
[0:58:22] <%FacetiousAF> pat doesn't care about us because we are not elmo
[0:58:23] <+KilogramHours> Ezreal x Lux is ONE SIDED
[0:58:29] <%Fenrirlives> I thought Lux went out with that Communist Chain guy
[0:58:33] <+CelioHogane> ZOE > EZREAL > LUX
[0:58:34] <+CptCreampuff16> in the regular league universe she doesnt know who Ez is
[0:58:36] <ilpeggiore_> nice face cat man
[0:58:38] <SilentEric> @KilogramHours FOR NOW
[0:58:38] <$Tuskor13> It's as canon as anything Ezreal's senile uncle says
[0:58:40] <+CelioHogane> NEEKO > A FEMALE, ANY OF THEM
[0:58:41] <+masarusasaki> why not attack with just lux
[0:58:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Guys Ezreal builds tear for a reason
[0:58:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @KilogramHours Oh.... Who's Sylas tho?
[0:58:52] <SilentEric> Just wait for Project F
[0:58:54] <Sayer_Raider> Zoe > Ezreal > Lux > Silas > Mage free Demacia
[0:59:02] <+CptCreampuff16> Sylas is new guy
[0:59:05] <Chaossheep> CelioHogane the smart play is always going for the shapeshifter
[0:59:05] <+KilogramHours> @Bane_Kaikyo Chained up mage who gives Lux vibes.
[0:59:08] <+CptCreampuff16> he steals magic
[0:59:09] <$Tuskor13> Leblanc is far superior to Neeko because they both shapeshift but Leblanc's base form doesn't look like a 14 year old
[0:59:11] <%FacetiousAF> y'all are talking like league has lore and match ups like a real game Kappa
[0:59:15] <+pectusumbra> LOG
[0:59:20] <+CelioHogane> @Sayer_Raider Mage free Demacia wich HE REIGNS OVER
[0:59:20] <%AnIrishPapaya> Lux decks are a big BS meta right now

[1:00:51] <rgbgamesinc> any chance of playing magic arena??
[1:00:54] <%Taisuru> @EndgameContent Pretty sure they were one and the same? Either way shouldn't I have gotten my Twitch Prime stuff or some sort of refund for my REAL MONEY purchases?
[1:01:00] <Chaossheep> if you'd hit the other one you would have won then
[1:01:03] <+masarusasaki> just attac
[1:01:05] <Chaossheep> right
[1:01:09] <$Tuskor13> What's stopping you from just attacking for game
[1:01:10] <crimsonsaens> You would just want to attack in a real game
[1:01:13] <+pectusumbra> they were attacking, no pat

[1:04:51] <restingbones> @Fenrirlives no Warwick. I mean League has so many charecters dude. they can only make so many cards before they start being repeats.
[1:04:51] <+pectusumbra> That's teemo
[1:04:51] <Axle13j> that's awesome lolol
[1:04:54] <+klassikFrank> I can't believe how accurately they translated Teemo into a CCG
[1:04:54] <%dekkitout> That sounds fun
[1:04:55] <PKHTjim> A burn deck.
[1:05:00] <Axle13j> Teemo deck
[1:05:03] <Kalcom> not when im tossing my cards
[1:05:05] <Sayer_Raider> Teemo + Karma deck: Game crashes due to mushrooms like that Dorohedoro villain
[1:05:06] <NiktenKing> It's RNG fun
[1:05:08] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Teemo causes people to ragequit yet again
[1:05:11] <Sayer_Raider> This is what a Teemo deck feels like
[1:05:14] <Sayer_Raider> Mushrooms everywhere
[1:05:22] <scrublord009> Always go level 8 to get the champions
[1:05:28] <restingbones> Pat has done his research :O
[1:05:28] <SilentEric> @Fenrirlives Same. I want Zac and Ekko. All my favorites are in one region, so it'll be forever.
[1:05:28] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Wait, Why the FUCK is Teemo with Piltover/Zaun.... and not like Bandle City?
[1:05:30] <crimsonsaens> Build to get the champion capsules
[1:05:30] <%Ninestempest> last month tho
[1:05:32] <+klassikFrank> It's just draft
[1:05:37] <Louie_Salmon> It's just arena
[1:05:37] <%heartlesshealer> Teemo is just a nightmare version of Parasite Paracide
[1:05:42] <+Evitron1> expeditions are just drafting but with less RNG impact
[1:05:43] <Sayer_Raider> @Bane_Kaikyo They don't have a Bandle City zone yet
[1:05:44] <chia233> what is the internet
[1:05:45] <crimsonsaens> RIP beta Expeditions

[1:08:52] <porygonftw> play ephemerals
[1:08:53] <Louie_Salmon> You are using the words card, hand, and deck interchangeably and it is fucking confusing
[1:08:54] <viciousgrim> pat did you ever play mtg. if chat knows pls tell
[1:08:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Probably could build a deck around with this, even if it's not optimal

[1:20:52] <SilentEric> Katarina times!
[1:20:58] <$CharlesRobinJr> @lvl10cybermancer thats good
[1:20:59] <+hawk_rush> yo guys! how's runeterra looking?
[1:21:18] <%heartlesshealer> spells tho
[1:21:22] <restingbones> Garen is the definition of "not cool"
[1:21:28] <cureneckbeard> ORE no TURN
[1:21:28] <%heartlesshealer> runeterra's looking alright
[1:21:43] <SilentEric> Garen is a cool dude.
[1:21:44] <SomeAsianDood> Yeah Garen's a huge Narc
[1:21:45] <$CharlesRobinJr> garren is just worst darius
[1:21:47] <scrublord009> Garen = Ultimates Capitain America
[1:21:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah but it's another card
[1:21:58] <crimsonsaens> Cithria is the best
[1:22:00] <MyNameIsRasus> It's just lore
[1:22:00] <Sayer_Raider> Cithria has 3 cards
[1:22:02] <SilentEric> Yep
[1:22:03] <Sayer_Raider> They tell her story
[1:22:03] <%Mendin> Cithria actually has a third card in-between whose name is different
[1:22:03] <restingbones> Yeah, she has 3 cards
[1:22:05] <scrublord009> Yes Cithria eventually stops being a scrub
[1:22:05] <+CelioHogane> DIFFERENT CARD
[1:22:05] <%Starotter70> psaBlind
[1:22:08] <+jacintafor> @PatStaresAt Cithria is in 3 cards
[1:22:09] <NiktenKing> Cithria has many cards
[1:22:10] <+Evitron1> ok to be fair i also did not make that connection
[1:22:11] <%Mendin> Veteran Vanguard or something
[1:22:12] <SilentEric> Cithria has three cards that tell her story
[1:22:12] <%BestTeaMaker> paige is literally already better than pat
[1:22:14] <%Mendin> She owns
[1:22:16] <+pectusumbra> Paige remembers the names of all the women she's killed
[1:22:16] <SomeAsianDood> Yeah she's also Vanguard Hopeful I think?
[1:22:17] <DrStinkers> there's tones of lore in the card descriptions
[1:22:18] <+Evitron1> bc im stupid as hell
[1:22:18] <j0ustar> Paige remembered?
[1:22:27] <%heartlesshealer> Paige sees every woman because of her targeting systems
[1:22:27] <+pectusumbra> that's why she can't solve puzzles
[1:22:31] <SilentEric> Right click on Cithria and read her flavor text!
[1:22:44] <restingbones> Garen is too scary for her to bother attacking.
[1:22:49] <scrublord009> @PatStaresAt Show Paige the more on the card
[1:22:51] <j0ustar> Paige you need to blow Pat's ass out in this game

[1:23:17] <SilentEric> Katarina and Garen secretly love each other.
[1:23:21] <ItsJustShawn> hope they put all that effort into the fighting game

[1:29:40] <porygonftw> :(
[1:29:40] <WalkerRedd> when's teppen?
[1:29:40] <%BestTeaMaker> pat why
[1:29:40] <shubachi> ????
[1:29:41] <+pectusumbra> spiders is a rush deck
[1:29:47] <restingbones> @Buka_Zero Teppen is an unbalanced mess.
[1:29:47] <Quite_Dapper> You monster
[1:29:51] <SomeAsianDood> Trump trades LUL
[1:29:51] <%SashaStarshine> Spiders is a zoo deck
[1:29:52] <lvl10cybermancer> y y
[1:29:53] <+malacante> there goes the poro herder value
[1:29:55] <+Buka_Zero> thats fair
[1:29:57] <Psyramics> why attack at all
[1:29:57] <$galaxyswirl> that was a silly thing to do
[1:29:57] <SilentEric> Poor Poros
[1:29:58] <+pectusumbra> teppen is the mobile capcom card game thing
[1:30:03] <Louie_Salmon> Bad trade, it are your minion for nothing
[1:30:05] <%SashaStarshine> Its based on flooding the board with small 1/1's
[1:30:05] <%BubbaRands> YOU KILLED HIS ONLY FRIEND BibleThump
[1:30:08] <DrkJP520> Is this game based on a franchise or something? Or is this a new IP?
[1:30:15] <Quite_Dapper> YEAH PAT
[1:30:16] <thehighdrated1> Talkin' like Pat cares for the poros
[1:30:17] <%arcaderabbit48> That's why why
[1:30:17] <%AnIrishPapaya> Big goofs
[1:30:20] <%SashaStarshine> Its based on League
[1:30:20] <SilentEric> You through those poros away
[1:30:22] <gmmoshupisbae> What are your favourite regions to play
[1:30:22] <+ccwettr123> @DrkJP520 league of legends characters and world
[1:30:22] <+jacintafor> LUL
[1:30:23] <%Spydurman> LUL
[1:30:23] <+pectusumbra> It's league of legends
[1:30:23] <SomeAsianDood> based on league of legends @DrkJP520
[1:30:26] <scrublord009> elks it is
[1:30:26] <%Bailey__gaming> there is never a poro when you need 1
[1:30:27] <Louie_Salmon> Oof
[1:30:30] <shubachi> its league of legends the card game
[1:30:31] <%Ninestempest> @DrkJP520 literally all league of legends
[1:30:33] <restingbones> Careful with those keyboard keys.
[1:30:36] <%PsycoZaku> hey hey Pat's playing a game I like that makes me feel special
[1:30:39] <DrkJP520> League eh? interesting
[1:30:57] <%Ninestempest> @DrkJP520 many characters in these decks are not really in league per se, but themed from locations in the league universe
[1:31:10] <DrStinkers> Pat when are you going to enter a tournament
[1:31:17] <%BubbaRands> Snacc
[1:31:22] <%dekkitout> Snackies for the baby
[1:31:32] <%arcaderabbit48> When are they adding Shaco tho
[1:31:35] <%Ninestempest> if pat had kept his poros out he would be doing so much better right now <_<
[1:31:38] <Quite_Dapper> But technically anything that happens in Runeterra is canon to the lore and the cards are all based on real events or people in Runeterra
[1:31:41] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt a general thing with these kinda games is that you don't want to attack unless you know that you can get an advantage or force a certain reaction, otherwise it's better to keep the cards for defensive purposes
[1:31:43] <SomeAsianDood> shaco's gonna be a long time away
[1:31:43] <scrublord009> poros seem to be important here
[1:31:49] <SomeAsianDood> @Quite_Dapper all canon
[1:31:52] <Louie_Salmon> If only you had poros
[1:31:56] <%Ninestempest> I WANT TRISTANAAAAAAAAA
[1:31:57] <+jacintafor> i think pat loses
[1:31:59] <crimsonsaens> You have to play Herder
[1:31:59] <%AnIrishPapaya> Wow. Those snacks with those pros would have been huge
[1:32:00] <SomeAsianDood> whoops that wasn't a question
[1:32:01] <%Ninestempest> WHENS TRISTANA
[1:32:06] <gmmoshupisbae> can't wait for mount targon
[1:32:09] <+EyeFarted> Damn, that's one doofy looking cat
[1:32:13] <+malacante> think we lost this one games
[1:32:13] <Quite_Dapper> I was gonna say
[1:32:13] <saiyan24675> saiyan24675 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Butts
[1:32:14] <ItsJustShawn> if the snaccs affect everywhere, can't you play them anytime?
[1:32:14] <Quite_Dapper> lol
[1:32:16] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt You can still play it. it also applies to poro's in your deck
[1:32:17] <%ArcanumMBD> 7 mana in the trash
[1:32:20] <+gralho> play tryn
[1:32:21] <thehighdrated1> Damn Pat if only them Poros didn't eat the fuckin' dust earlier
[1:32:22] <%Ninestempest> or maybe DO NOT LET THEM DIE
[1:32:24] <+chase959> should have used the snack
[1:32:24] <crimsonsaens> Pat's actually going to die to the tutorial

[1:32:31] <%dekkitout> Aw, he needs a frien
[1:32:35] <gmmoshupisbae> welp
[1:32:35] <+D00msDayDan> the way pat says poro sounds like he's an anime mascot character
[1:32:37] <%silverira> I can feel Pat's goblins freaking out from here

[1:32:45] <PKHTjim> New York lost?

[1:33:06] <thehighdrated1> Ok but like the poro herder tho
[1:33:06] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat the "buffs poros everywhere" text includes poros in your deck
[1:33:08] <Quite_Dapper> Pat you aren't bad you just need to understand what to keep on the field and what to faceroll with
[1:33:08] <%PsycoZaku> oh no this is just challenges
[1:33:12] <PKHTjim> Poro seems to be setup-heavy.
[1:33:14] <NiktenKing> Pat... the snax applies to EVERYWHERE
[1:33:14] <scrublord009> nah, it's poro deck shit's weird
[1:33:16] <%PsycoZaku> I believe in you pat

[1:33:39] <%arcaderabbit48> Buffs for DAYS
[1:33:41] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, Poro Snax and some other cards say "Everywhere" that means any card, wheater its in your deck and special summons. It really means EVERYWHERE (as long as its under your control.
[1:33:42] <%Bailey__gaming> Eveywhere meabs everywhere in this game
[1:33:42] <$galaxyswirl> @PatStaresAt what did you think everywhere meant?
[1:33:42] <j0ustar> The Poro-everywhere system is pretty alright
[1:33:45] <NiktenKing> Poro deck is the literal SNOWBALLING deck
[1:33:49] <scrublord009> gibe poro friend
[1:33:58] <%arcaderabbit48> No attac
[1:34:02] <DrStinkers> even poros that are generated from other effects
[1:34:02] <crimsonsaens> Don't attack
[1:34:02] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeh
[1:34:04] <thehighdrated1> Now draw the herder
[1:34:04] <%BubbaRands> Fwend back! :D
[1:34:05] <Louie_Salmon> You should have attacked first there, for 1 free damage

[1:34:29] <NiktenKing> BIG PORO
[1:34:31] <+malacante> it's almost like the tutorial is teaching you that you shouldn't always attack
[1:34:39] <%Ninestempest> the ability to build your board > randomly doing 1-0 damage
[1:34:47] <%arcaderabbit48> PORO
[1:34:57] <lvl10cybermancer> Yeah this game is actually more Magic-like than Hearthstone-like in a lot of ways
[1:34:58] <%Treuan> Poro come from value town

[1:36:48] <crimsonsaens> Challenge Darius
[1:36:50] <SilentEric> Burst doesnt' take your turn, so you can attack right away.

[1:37:59] <restingbones> Time to KILL
[1:38:00] <$ItsRatman> GETTING ANGRY
[1:38:00] <Kalcom> and u won

[1:38:19] <%Bailey__gaming> Swing to win
[1:38:21] <+Evitron1> i wish i were that pissed off
[1:38:21] <%SirGO0SE> psaWink
[1:38:21] <NiktenKing> Go for face
[1:38:22] <DrkJP520> Is Pat still soggy and topless?
[1:38:26] <Louie_Salmon> If you play you give them a chance to respond
[1:38:26] <reonome> holy shit LUL
[1:38:27] <SomeAsianDood> bming ai LUL
[1:38:29] <ScatterCatt> Pat can literally just attack with everything and end the game, but he decides to be a dick and play two more cards lolololol
[1:38:29] <+pectusumbra> yes
[1:38:30] <DrStinkers> pro level
[1:38:30] <YamatoNoHasu> in cases like that its better to just atack so oponent cant play cards
[1:38:31] <thehighdrated1> BIG HUGE TRYN
[1:38:31] <TheArrow_> @PatStaresAt attacking early can be really good because your opponent won't get to play anything
[1:38:32] <lvl10cybermancer> Gottem
[1:38:32] <%BubbaRands> DOUBLE DIGITS PogChamp
[1:38:34] <Sir_Dolphinian> top fed
[1:38:34] <+CelioHogane> MINUS 26
[1:38:36] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab psaDab
[1:38:36] <%Ninestempest> @PatStaresAt if you attack before playing anything, the opponent cannot even summon one thing, just for future reerence
[1:38:37] <+Ayyy_Steve> Pat found the best starter deck I see
[1:38:39] <%Bailey__gaming> A winner is you Pat
[1:38:42] <Frostydough1> yo how late am i guys
[1:38:43] <$CharlesRobinJr> @PatStaresAt what seems to be the problem with PSO2
[1:38:44] <%dekkitout> Berserker was fed as shit
[1:38:47] <scrublord009> POROS OP PLEASE NERF Kappa
[1:38:49] <%Aztec50> now thats a win!
[1:38:54] <+The_Protagonist> wow tryn seems busted af
[1:38:55] <Louie_Salmon> Big excited
[1:38:56] <%Bailey__gaming> Jynx is best waifu
[1:38:56] <%Ninestempest> @CharlesRobinJr literally everything
[1:38:57] <BlackermanZX> a fed trynd doodWAT
[1:38:59] <$Tuskor13> Jinx is insane
[1:39:02] <SilentEric> Jinx? Stands for Jinx
[1:39:02] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt For future reference, if you can kill the opponent you usually want to swing immidiately. They might have a card to kill your whole board they can play if you give them thier turn.
[1:39:02] <+jacintafor> she's crazy
[1:39:03] <+CelioHogane> SHE IS GETTING A TV SHOW
[1:39:05] <%moogleboy1984> Flat Justice
[1:39:05] <Sayer_Raider> Jinx is the fucking best
[1:39:08] <SomeAsianDood> she's great because flat is justice
[1:39:09] <thehighdrated1> Jinx is mad lame
[1:39:09] <Quite_Dapper> Of course, because even guys can cosplay it easy AF
[1:39:11] <reonome> harley quinn of LoL
[1:39:13] <$Tuskor13> Jinx looks like a meth addict
[1:39:14] <%BubbaRands> Easy to cosplay
[1:39:17] <%SirGO0SE> jynx Kreygasm
[1:39:17] <+klassikFrank> Pat, you check out Pyramid Head in DBD yet?
[1:39:18] <%Bailey__gaming> She's basicly a better Harley Quinn
[1:39:18] <+Ayyy_Steve> Crazy is hot
[1:39:19] <%WhereIsWill> jinx can get it Kreygasm
[1:39:20] <@SoFarFetched> S P E E D
[1:39:22] <BlackermanZX> Jinx is one of my favorites
[1:39:23] <crimsonsaens> The rare meha poro
[1:39:23] <%Agami23> jinx got a big fancy music video
[1:39:23] <%Ynkubus18> Jinx is Moba Tank Girl
[1:39:24] <Sayer_Raider> Jinx is the ultimate hot
[1:39:28] <NiktenKing> It's cause she had the first League music video and everybody loved it
[1:39:30] <Monstanimation> She is basically Harley Queen
[1:39:33] <viewtifulr> oof his voice
[1:39:33] <%heartlesshealer> that and jinx's reveal kinda went off
[1:39:35] <PKHTjim> Harley is an abuse victim. Rather Jynx.
[1:39:45] <$ItsRatman> Cast your mystic shot on jinx Kreygasm
[1:39:45] <%heartlesshealer> or video, whatever it was
[1:39:46] <%Ninestempest> not 0 cost in real game :(
[1:39:47] <$CharlesRobinJr> @Ninestempest is it the servers or optimization
[1:39:47] <DrStinkers> tutorial only
[1:39:58] <DougintheTrench> Jinx is female Joker with less clothes.
[1:39:59] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah this is the un-nerfed tutorial version
[1:40:02] <+CelioHogane> @PKHTjim Jynx probably also is...
[1:40:03] <DougintheTrench> Of course she's popular.
[1:40:15] <jimmytwofeet> MUCH FLASHY, SO TACTICS
[1:40:16] <+pectusumbra> It's like playing league all over again
[1:40:16] <%Ninestempest> @CharlesRobinJr it's the game randomly deletes large chunks of itself and the permissions of the windows store don't let you uninstall the rest of it, or re-install missing bits, nor does it actually TELL YOU when this happens
[1:40:20] <scrublord009> COUNTER
[1:40:20] <Louie_Salmon> And now Pat learns about the S T A C K
[1:40:36] <Quite_Dapper> PAT you should be reading all of the enemies cards as well
[1:40:38] <scrublord009> yeah
[1:40:39] <%Agami23> this is very in line for him
[1:40:43] <%Mendin> Several Champion's level up abilities dont require them to be on the field
[1:40:46] <$Tuskor13> It's true to him in League because you just spam moves
[1:40:47] <+DinnerCalzone> Oh did they rewrite the cards to be in the 2nd person instead of the 1st person? That made me irrationally annoyed before
[1:40:48] <SilentEric> Ezreal is for combo decks. He can win the game in one turn, on like turn 10
[1:40:49] <%Ninestempest> @CharlesRobinJr meaning there's basically a random chance that you have to figure out how to either get around those permissions, or just delete HUGE chunks of your hard drive
[1:40:54] <%BubbaRands> TIMING
[1:41:00] <Personified134> @DinnerCalzone no, there are both
[1:41:01] <%silverira> yeah you usualy build a deck with teemo and ezreal
[1:41:01] <%SashaStarshine> @PatStaresAt Its actually not just spells, monster effects that target enemies count as well
[1:41:02] <Louie_Salmon> Last in, first out
[1:41:11] <restingbones> Heck yeah, thats what I like about this game. So many potential Counterplays :D
[1:41:12] <$CharlesRobinJr> @Ninestempest thats sounds real bad i was thinking about getting it but i heard it was bad justt didnt know why
[1:41:16] <+DinnerCalzone> @Personified134 Ah, is there a distinction between them?
[1:41:22] <FrootusClopootus> Made a ghost deck called Jump scare and shark chariot always seems to catch people off guard
[1:41:25] <%Nameloc1667> Pat, you've got me hooked on this now. Damn you!
[1:41:29] <Kalcom> why
[1:41:31] <%Dante_Magnum> do we have peepee cam because pat doesn't want to be on cam?
[1:41:31] <%PsycoZaku> I feel like pat will really like heimerdinger
[1:41:42] <%Nameloc1667> @Dante_Magnum Yes
[1:41:46] <Personified134> @DinnerCalzone 1st person means the card itself has to do something (like attack), 2nd person refers to player actions
[1:41:46] <SomeAsianDood> why because he's short and hairy? Kappa @PsycoZaku
[1:41:47] <%SashaStarshine> Pat would love Nautilus i'd imagine
[1:41:51] <%SashaStarshine> BIG 'OL
[1:41:51] <+chase959> defeat jinx
[1:41:52] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:41:52] <%Nameloc1667> In the title it says because of the AC
[1:41:52] <%Dante_Magnum> fair
[1:41:52] <thehighdrated1> That art is ugly
[1:41:53] <%Ninestempest> @CharlesRobinJr If you're lucky like me, nothing will be wrong and you can just play. I've had no issues, and there's solutions for some issues on the pso2 subreddit, but yeah it's a bit of a wild fire right now. Honestly, it's free, so it doesn't hurt to at least TRY.
[1:41:56] <%arancet> said Defeat Jinx, so just win
[1:41:59] <%Dante_Magnum> I appreciate emlo cam
[1:41:59] <scrublord009> beat her
[1:42:02] <Sir_Dolphinian> Elmo must stream more he is the best streamer and a good boy
[1:42:04] <+GenericGent> Jinx: time for some Triple Triad loser
[1:42:18] <%Ninestempest> wtf is piltover power up
[1:42:20] <reonome> i think it just telling you you can play for real now
[1:42:20] <%Ninestempest> is this some beta shit
[1:42:23] <SilentEric> Yep
[1:42:28] <SomeAsianDood> @Ninestempest not in base game, just tutorial
[1:42:29] <+lethallylactic> @thehighdrated1 Yeah, the style of this game is what's turning me off a bit. I'll be sticking with Magic.
[1:42:30] <someyounguy1> lol pats looking very fuzzy today
[1:42:31] <SilentEric> Tutorial stuff has cards not in the game
[1:42:32] <Kalcom> what are these cards
[1:42:39] <%Ninestempest> fucking weird
[1:42:40] <%SashaStarshine> The tutorial has a bunch of unique cards
[1:42:44] <%SashaStarshine> to teach concepts
[1:42:45] <%heartlesshealer> tutorial cards
[1:42:51] <+jacintafor> close enough
[1:42:51] <%dekkitout> Pizza time
[1:42:55] <Spiritttz> rip play order
[1:42:59] <%SashaStarshine> Ezreal is different in the tutorial as well
[1:43:00] <%Ninestempest> are they cards that were in closed beta, or like literally just unique cards
[1:43:05] <%Nameloc1667> What was his plan?
[1:43:07] <Spiritttz> tutorial is dumb yo
[1:43:09] <lvl10cybermancer> Honestly I hate the fact that the tutorial versions of some cards are different than the normal version of those cards
[1:43:09] <%SashaStarshine> Literally just unique
[1:43:10] <Louie_Salmon> Big brain AI
[1:43:12] <crimsonsaens> @Ninestempest both
[1:43:14] <%Bailey__gaming> DoritosChip
[1:43:17] <%Ninestempest> ah okay
[1:43:18] <%SashaStarshine> Ez is different in tutorial as well, no Elusive
[1:43:20] <+jacintafor> spin
[1:43:21] <+GenericGent> nice shock
[1:43:23] <SomeAsianDood> unique, though based off real cards
[1:43:25] <%Ninestempest> yeah i saw that
[1:43:25] <lvl10cybermancer> But it's also kind of fitting for a League card game to have a garbage tutorial
[1:43:26] <%Ninestempest> weird
[1:43:31] <+jacintafor> you can
[1:43:35] <DrStinkers> you can but don't
[1:43:37] <%Ninestempest> ehhhhh it isn't garbage, it's just weird
[1:43:42] <+TeethMuncher> Did Elmo become a streamer?
[1:43:43] <NiktenKing> Can but nah dont
[1:43:48] <The_Cassowary> is this the Riot Games entry into the card game genre?
[1:43:50] <reonome> the tutorial is pretty solid ngl
[1:43:51] <+pectusumbra> shoot the target!
[1:43:52] <SilentEric> It's a pretty good tutorial. It's teaching concepts, not what the cards do.
[1:43:57] <%Nameloc1667> Eyyy
[1:44:02] <%psidefx> The Elmo streams are great
[1:44:04] <+marlborored5> 0@
[1:44:05] <%heartlesshealer> re-casting
[1:44:06] <SomeAsianDood> Man I wish ez gave you a free mystic shot on nexus strike PepeHands
[1:44:08] <+pectusumbra> yes it is
[1:44:08] <%Ninestempest> @PatStaresAt nothing in that deck was real <_<
[1:44:09] <+chase959> Ezreal and karma can fuck right off
[1:44:11] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt wait untill you see TEEMO
[1:44:14] <SomeAsianDood> That shit would be broken
[1:44:16] <lvl10cybermancer> But then it's confusing when you play the real game and the same cards do different things
[1:44:17] <SilentEric> This one is fun.
[1:44:19] <$galaxyswirl> @PatStaresAt so real ezreal also has elusive, so he is even more crazy
[1:44:20] <+RandomMishaps> In tutorial he is, I've seen him die a LOT in PvP
[1:44:20] <fabo_joyful> Blep-mo is best.
[1:44:20] <%BubbaRands> Would this be considered a burn deck?
[1:44:22] <%Mendin> The spell deck gets absolutely nutso
[1:44:23] <NiktenKing> Nah Heimerdinger is the power of a spell deck
[1:44:23] <restingbones> Good news Pat
[1:44:24] <crimsonsaens> This is the best one
[1:44:27] <ha2ken> But gun tho
[1:44:29] <ha2ken> Gun
[1:44:29] <%Agami23> with an octopus head
[1:44:30] <+pectusumbra> He's a skeleton that is also a ghost
[1:44:34] <%UvBenServed> Hot skeleton
[1:44:34] <%heartlesshealer> all about challenging
[1:44:35] <Monstanimation> Ghost Rider?
[1:44:36] <+pectusumbra> with dreads that are bones
[1:44:37] <Louie_Salmon> @lvl10cybermancer I would hope they'll update the tutorial at some point
[1:44:37] <SilentEric> Is that skeleton hot enough for Peach?
[1:44:38] <cureneckbeard> psaSkelmoney
[1:44:38] <+DinnerCalzone> he got bone dreads
[1:44:38] <reonome> skost
[1:44:38] <$ItsRatman> Oh no Paige has a new skeleton boyfriend
[1:44:39] <%SirGO0SE> uh oh...we need the cam on peach to keep her honest
[1:44:40] <$Dakuu75> sploosh
[1:44:42] <%Ninestempest> @BubbaRands not really, just control. burn decks in this game are all 1-3 cost cards that are cheap minions or direct damage
[1:44:42] <%Aztec50> oh man im excited
[1:44:44] <+TeethMuncher> All my homies love Heimerdinger
[1:44:44] <WholesomeCumiesPeddler> Lucian is also really cool tho
[1:44:45] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Senna monkaS
[1:44:45] <IamGrapes> OMG the Thrash Prince!
[1:44:47] <Spiritttz> Im sad Senna doesnt have a better card id love her ult in spell form
[1:44:49] <SilentEric> Please dont' date Thresh.
[1:44:51] <%silverira> he also steals other people wives @PatStaresAt
[1:44:51] <$galaxyswirl> WAIT WHY IS SENNA IN?
[1:44:51] <PKHTjim> Lucian.... He's a deck. Time to download.
[1:44:51] <%nikoloas_> this tutorial is canon
[1:44:52] <%WarlockaFlocka> Yeah but Lucian tho
[1:44:53] <$CharlesRobinJr> pat no paige wants him
[1:44:54] <SilentEric> He is a bad man.
[1:44:58] <%Aztec50> pat play your wife
[1:45:04] <+jacintafor> They made this before senna was a champ
[1:45:08] <restingbones> @galaxyswirl cos shes cool?
[1:45:10] <StarkMaximum> @galaxyswirl senna's just back now
[1:45:10] <$galaxyswirl> SHE IS A CHAMP????
[1:45:17] <Spiritttz> They married
[1:45:17] <SilentEric> They love each other.
[1:45:18] <NiktenKing> @Spiritttz That's her lore art before she got taken
[1:45:19] <DingusMcBaseball> me lucian
[1:45:20] <+CelioHogane> @galaxyswirl no
[1:45:20] <%Ninestempest> yes senna is a champ wtf is surprising about this
[1:45:21] <Kalcom> no champ
[1:45:23] <PKHTjim> Lore cards...
[1:45:23] <$galaxyswirl> WHY IS SHE NOT A CHAMP CARD?
[1:45:24] <+TeethMuncher> @galaxyswirl no
[1:45:24] <reonome> he levels if senna dies
[1:45:25] <%arancet> she is NOT a chammp
[1:45:26] <SomeAsianDood> Actually it was made at roughly the same time @jacintafor
[1:45:26] <Kalcom> normal card
[1:45:27] <%heartlesshealer> They start raging if someone kills their loved one
[1:45:27] <restingbones> @galaxyswirl Nah, not a champion, just a rugular card
[1:45:28] <DrStinkers> Lucian HATES when you shoot his wife
[1:45:29] <Spiritttz> oh i know
[1:45:30] <%bevyrage> senna has a railgun in the game iirc
[1:45:30] <WholesomeCumiesPeddler> They're married
[1:45:30] <+pectusumbra> she came out BEFORE she released in league so she doesn't have a champ card
[1:45:31] <lvl10cybermancer> VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Quick Attack is NOT first strike, it's first strike ONLY on the attack
[1:45:32] <shubachi> senna is a champion
[1:45:33] <%SashaStarshine> She's a champion in league but not a Champion card in LOR
[1:45:34] <%Aztec50> this card is before she gets bagged by thresh
[1:45:35] <%Ninestempest> oh it's just tutorial shit guys
[1:45:35] <+its_a_mimic> what is this trash
[1:45:36] <%SirGO0SE> i no scured of dark
[1:45:38] <+CelioHogane> @galaxyswirl i mean she is a champ in the MOBA, but here is her pre-dying version
[1:45:39] <%Ninestempest> TUTORIAL
[1:45:47] <%SashaStarshine> Because the card released before the champion in League
[1:45:47] <Spiritttz> im just hopping we get a post lantern version some day
[1:45:48] <BlackermanZX> oh so she is normal senna
[1:45:52] <DrkJP520> This game popular?
[1:45:59] <%SashaStarshine> Pre dying Senna, yes
[1:45:59] <$galaxyswirl> guess, senna is a champ in league, im confused why she isnt one HERE
[1:46:00] <SilentEric> Yep. It's Senna before being killed
[1:46:06] <SomersaultJustice> where's that slutty fox girl everyone loves
[1:46:10] <+TeethMuncher> @DrkJP520 yes
[1:46:19] <SomeAsianDood> ahri's not in LOR yet @SomersaultJustice
[1:46:19] <%BubbaRands> they fuckin
[1:46:20] <%SashaStarshine> @galaxyswirl Its because her card was released before the champion
[1:46:21] <mistermastergreg> wow, Pat finally morphed into Elmo
[1:46:26] <+pectusumbra> I don't think Ahri is actually in yet. Also she's a Kumiho
[1:46:27] <ha2ken> Senna's voice <3
[1:46:34] <+CelioHogane> Ahsi is not yet
[1:46:36] <SilentEric> "Hello Love"
[1:46:36] <$galaxyswirl> @SashaStarshine aaaaaaah, thats dumb
[1:46:40] <Spiritttz> Ahris isnt in yet
[1:46:40] <%Nobrev> paige is kill
[1:46:41] <NiktenKing> You guys... its easy to tell that it isn't her new champ design... she isn't wielding big dick energy gun
[1:46:43] <%WarlockaFlocka> Did Lucian get a new VA?
[1:46:46] <%SirGO0SE> @SomersaultJustice give me slutty fox girl and slutty hat girl
[1:46:47] <+malacante> order super matters in this attack I'm suprised tehy're not telling you
[1:46:52] <Orenjevel> elmo sure is a good streamer these days, he doesn't even need pat and paige around to work.
[1:46:55] <crimsonsaens> You would want to attack with Lucian first in this case, but it doesn't matter for the tutorial
[1:47:01] <%Ninestempest> whens AHRI and TRISTANA
[1:47:05] <%Ninestempest> GIMME AHRI AND TRISTANA
[1:47:10] <%TheQButton> Braum is a pretty good card for countering those tricky decks with a lotta "on death" minions.
[1:47:14] <%Nameloc1667> Pat, I learned that you can drag over your whole team and make them all attack at once. It helps a bit with timing stuff
[1:47:16] <StarkMaximum> I want poppy
[1:47:17] <SilentEric> I love his level up animation
[1:47:17] <reonome> senna exists to die LUL
[1:47:20] <%SashaStarshine> Next expansion got leaked btw
[1:47:23] <ha2ken> Kill your wife to level up
[1:47:23] <SilentEric> This is sick!

[1:50:34] <+jacintafor> he said the thing
[1:50:39] <SomeAsianDood> @VritraReiRei you can't get one cosmetic but that's literally it.
[1:50:42] <SilentEric> Fun fact. Yone thinks Yasuo killed their master, and is hunting him down to kill him. Yasuo ends up killing his brother Yone. @PatStaresAt
[1:50:42] <crimsonsaens> Lee Sin Draven is the truth
[1:50:49] <%WhereIsWill> hasagi!
[1:50:50] <PKHTjim> Yasuo is a control deck...

[1:51:04] <scrublord009> Yasuo decks. The bane of my existance
[1:51:05] <restingbones> Yeah, if you can get Yasou up and running he will DESTROY the enemy board.
[1:51:15] <%Buzzard42> Ionia is the most infuriating faction
[1:51:22] <Hellarussian> waskally wabit
[1:51:28] <+CelioHogane> @Buzzard42 uhh, Ashe teemo
[1:51:31] <SomeAsianDood> Deny is the best card in the game don't @ me
[1:51:40] <%Buzzard42> @CelioHogane that's not a faction
[1:51:45] <%GarbageNirvana> RAAAAH
[1:51:46] <Spiritttz> They did nerf it to 4 right?
[1:51:49] <+blurblewurble> i can't tell if yasuo is Liam O'Brien or not

[1:52:01] <+CelioHogane> @blurblewurble it's on the card game, at least.
[1:52:03] <Kalcom> is this lore
[1:52:04] <BeNiceImShy> That kerning on 'Avarosan' was real bad
[1:52:06] <Orenjevel> One thing about computer card games I can't get past is that why would you ever prefer to play with cards instead of the things the cards represent
[1:52:10] <ha2ken> How smashing
[1:52:22] <+GenericGent> no this is patrick
[1:52:39] <dinnydanny777> I just joined and I've never played this game before can you sum it up?

[1:53:11] <BlackermanZX> better sylvanas
[1:53:14] <kambamdamn> psaElmo
[1:53:15] <restingbones> Ashe Lore is way cooler than Sylvanas anyway
[1:53:16] <ha2ken> Dat Ashe doe
[1:53:16] <Chaossheep> Ashe is a cool character, she's fun to play
[1:53:18] <@SoFarFetched> Sylvanas is from WoW
[1:53:19] <SilentEric> Sylvan-who?
[1:53:21] <$Dakuu75> it's funny hearing pat say so'n so is "so cool" because veteran league players would be like "FUCK THAT GUY!" XD
[1:53:24] <viewtifulr> i texted :)
[1:53:25] <Hellarussian> oooh look at Mr. Popular over here
[1:53:28] <SilentEric> mogwaiSap mogwaiSap
[1:53:28] <+Karebuncle> loool orb slap
[1:53:29] <SomeAsianDood> Well at least Ashe isn't morally grey like Sylvannas LUL
[1:53:31] <Daxalog> I wish you could skip past the evolution animations. Especially when its a won / lost turn.

[1:53:42] <T_Sasquatch> How can she slap?
[1:53:43] <SilentEric> Play Yone!
[1:53:43] <%Buzzard42> orb slap
[1:53:44] <+pectusumbra> Let's be fair, at this point every character based on Sylvanas is better than her
[1:53:44] <%WhereIsWill> da ORB
[1:53:48] <ha2ken> How can she slap
[1:53:56] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Pat stop bringing up characters nobody knows from that obscure company that hasn't made videogames since nineties, Snowstorm or something Kappa
[1:54:01] <TheArrow_> *slaps orb* this bad boy can fit so much red bull in it
[1:54:02] <dinnydanny777> I keep trying to be morally grey but people keep calling me a dick
[1:54:06] <%Buzzard42> yone punch is an easy one
[1:54:08] <qo_op> what you mean pat all lady archers are sylvanas
[1:54:11] <scrublord009> IT BEGINS. THE DARK SIDE. YASUO STUN
[1:54:19] <SomeAsianDood> just get more attractive @dinnydanny777
[1:54:21] <SilentEric> Yasuo is very fun
[1:54:25] <%Nobrev> @dinnydanny777 you must not be attractive enough
[1:54:30] <crimsonsaens> 4/4 Yone looks naked
[1:54:34] <Hellarussian> I play Pot of Greed
[1:54:37] <SilentEric> Remember, Health is a resource
[1:54:39] <+pectusumbra> stuns?
[1:54:42] <Cactuskris> did pat ever try out shadowverse
[1:54:50] <Cactuskris> also better heartstone
[1:54:51] <dinnydanny777> That character sounds like Spongebob
[1:54:55] <Sayer_Raider> Pat, use stun
[1:54:55] <Kalcom> steel
[1:54:58] <restingbones> Stun dude
[1:55:00] <TheArrow_> I don't really know anything about League, but playing this game makes me really excited for that one fighting game they're working on
[1:55:00] <Sayer_Raider> Yasuo attacks anyone stunned
[1:55:05] <scrublord009> Stun the tren
[1:55:05] <SilentEric> Stun Tryn and just take the 4 damage hit
[1:55:07] <T_Sasquatch> How the hell do people make good decks in this without stealing someone else's deck
[1:55:09] <crimsonsaens> Tempest Tryn
[1:55:15] <dinnydanny777> That really sounds like Spongebob to me
[1:55:22] <+pectusumbra> then just take 4
[1:55:23] <SilentEric> You have plenty of health.
[1:55:26] <scrublord009> You were supposed to stun the 2 of them I think?
[1:55:32] <BeNiceImShy> @T_Sasquatch They don't
[1:55:35] <Spiritttz> this is fine too
[1:55:36] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Last time I saw Shadowverse it had that problem of wildly inconsistent card art both in style and quality, like it was from different games
[1:55:37] <+pectusumbra> it's fine
[1:55:44] <Sayer_Raider> It still work
[1:55:50] <lvl10cybermancer> He didn't have enough mana
[1:55:52] <crimsonsaens> Just attack
[1:55:52] <StarkMaximum> @t_sasquatch By getting over the fallacy that using a deck someone else made is bad. Take someone else's list as a starting point and tweak it as you play.
[1:55:53] <Hellarussian> its cool cause everything is overpowered
[1:55:54] <scrublord009> WILLIAM OF IONIA PogChamp
[1:56:02] <%Tallie> recall yone and play him again for big stuns
[1:56:04] <reonome> thats a unit

[1:56:15] <SomeAsianDood> quick attack pat
[1:56:15] <dinnydanny777> I literally have no idea what is happening in the game
[1:56:17] <reonome> nvm
[1:56:17] <SilentEric> Or use the attack buff, since you have quick attack
[1:56:17] <$galaxyswirl> GG
[1:56:19] <+jacintafor> it will work
[1:56:19] <dinnydanny777> Lol

[1:56:23] <NiktenKing> It's fine, but not optimal
[1:56:23] <Spiritttz> its not optimal but its fine
[1:56:25] <restingbones> NOT YET
[1:56:28] <preppyposs> stin*
[1:56:28] <+pectusumbra> a little early
[1:56:28] <%Treuan> If you recall won't tryndy get healed?
[1:56:33] <SilentEric> You can buff after he declares blockers.
[1:56:40] <+pectusumbra> fortunately the AI is dumb but that's okay
[1:56:43] <%AnIrishPapaya> Try and is gonna wreck
[1:56:45] <DrivenDust> BACKSEAT GAMING LOOL

[1:57:01] <restingbones> Pat save your burst spells for last second.
[1:57:03] <Hellarussian> Yasuo says "LEAF me alone"
[1:57:07] <SilentEric> Big recall time!
[1:57:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Why did that Samurai just sound like Jesse McCree?
[1:57:10] <%Buzzard42> let pat make mistakes
[1:57:22] <SomeAsianDood> @dinnydanny777 same va yup
[1:57:30] <+jacintafor> mistakes is part of the process in card games
[1:57:30] <%bevyrage> @XeroSigmaPrime same VA

[1:57:45] <reonome> nothing personnel kid
[1:57:47] <SilentEric> Mistakes are fine, but this is a long tutorial to have to redo. mogwaiSad
[1:57:49] <Spiritttz> Hes doing fine making optimal plays is for later
[1:57:52] <Sayer_Raider> Pat, Minah can recall 3 enemies
[1:57:57] <restingbones> yeah Minah would have been the best play
[1:57:57] <SomeAsianDood> @bevyrage @XeroSigmaPrime different vas Yasuo is Liam o Brien, McCree is Matt Mercer
[1:57:58] <Sayer_Raider> Enemies that recall are attacked b yYasuo
[1:58:00] <Kalcom> like the core
[1:58:00] <lvl10cybermancer> Pat's doing fine
[1:58:02] <crimsonsaens> You can heal you Nexus
[1:58:03] <Sayer_Raider> You could've killed both cards

[1:58:20] <Rionxgarland> psaUp_FC
[1:58:21] <crimsonsaens> What was the point of buffing Yasuo?
[1:58:27] <%Buzzard42> he's winning, which is all that matters
[1:58:28] <+MajorCrasher> missed lethal
[1:58:28] <%linSP> pat put his cursor on the p on pass and it looked like ass
[1:58:30] <reonome> its a tutorial its fine LUL
[1:58:37] <Sayer_Raider> Wait until he plays rankeds
[1:58:38] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Pat, dont waste your burst spells until you see how the enemy chooses to block. You can play them at any time.
[1:58:38] <$galaxyswirl> pat is doing this the most backwards way, so on brand
[1:58:39] <dinnydanny777> So how do you min max this game?
[1:58:41] <PKHTjim> Oh heals also heal nexus, huh.
[1:58:42] <Sayer_Raider> It's gonna be a shitshow
[1:58:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SomeAsianDood Yea i gured, didnt sound like him exactly. More like why did the Samurai have a New Mexican Accent

[1:59:55] <NiktenKing> Yasuo is Wooliebait AND Minah is Reggiebait
[2:00:03] <lvl10cybermancer> I'd really like to see how Shaco would get adapted to this game
[2:00:03] <Hellarussian> straight up
[2:00:03] <BackwardCap> Sometimes you just don't draw Yasuo OWLSombra
[2:00:04] <$galaxyswirl> LUL

[2:00:32] <PKHTjim> Overwhelm is trample.
[2:00:32] <Saturdaythe14th> This is actually a pretty good mix between HS and MTG.
[2:00:34] <Chaossheep> Ekko I think
[2:00:38] <NiktenKing> No, these are mini scenarios
[2:00:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SomeAsianDood LOL thats the best
[2:00:52] <SilentEric> Battling means attacking or blocking
[2:00:56] <reonome> play it pat

[2:01:02] <DrStinkers> just do it

[2:01:09] <%BestTeaMaker> just play the card
[2:01:09] <+klassikFrank> THIS IS A TUTORIAL
[2:01:09] <iosephe> IT MAKES THEM FIGHT NOW
[2:01:09] <Spiritttz> overwelm gos threww even if blocker dies
[2:01:10] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt strike will kill before blocking takes place
[2:01:10] <restingbones> Yeah but he does it BEFORE the attack
[2:01:10] <Sayer_Raider> Just DO IT
[2:01:10] <Chaossheep> Pat please do math
[2:01:10] <$galaxyswirl> THATS NOT HOW THAT WORKS PAT
[2:01:10] <scrublord009> This is good, it teaches overwhelem mechanics
[2:01:11] <%arancet> itll do it twice
[2:01:11] <+Lozzu> do it
[2:01:12] <%moogleboy1984> not simultaneous
[2:01:12] <Sayer_Raider> DO IT
[2:01:13] <Hellarussian> pat
[2:01:14] <bearking05> it attack before attack
[2:01:14] <scrublord009> DO IT
[2:01:15] <twoto858> It won't deal a killing blow
[2:01:15] <+EndgameContent> You get to hit him for free
[2:01:16] <j0ustar> Pat
[2:01:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Just watch
[2:01:16] <NiktenKing> USE IT
[2:01:17] <%Buzzard42> DO IT
[2:01:17] <preppyposs> do it
[2:01:17] <anentirecrab> It will let him strike before combat occurs so you can remove card then still get to swing during combat with no blockers @PatStaresAt
[2:01:17] <CherrieVelvet> just try it tho
[2:01:18] <%Ninestempest> JUST FUCKIGN DO IT AN DYOU WILL SEE
[2:01:19] <+gralho> before he atacks he atacks
[2:01:19] <%Bane_Kaikyo> LEARN BY DOING
[2:01:19] <DrStinkers> strike is different than 'attack'
[2:01:20] <sendart> WIN THIS TURN DUMMY
[2:01:22] <SilentEric> Watch.
[2:01:24] <qo_op> big brain
[2:01:24] <jbrowning134> Is pats conscious trapped inside Elmo like some sort of 90s body swap movie?
[2:01:26] <dinnydanny777> Dig up?
[2:01:28] <PKHTjim> Strike does attack power damage to a unit.
[2:01:29] <+EndgameContent> Strike means deal Strength damage to Health
[2:01:30] <%Buzzard42> do it and find out why
[2:01:33] <SomeAsianDood> FailFish jesus past
[2:01:34] <Chaossheep> If you kill the guy now, you will win
[2:01:35] <iosephe> IT'S A SPELL
[2:01:35] <+pectusumbra> You. Did it
[2:01:36] <Hellarussian> oh the goblins
[2:01:37] <+DinnerCalzone> he attac and he attac
[2:01:39] <restingbones> Thats implied Pat xD
[2:01:40] <SilentEric> No that is reasonable chat.
[2:01:40] <%Ninestempest> All spells go first
[2:01:42] <Sayer_Raider> Overwhelm only does extra damage IF your card attacks FIRST
[2:01:42] <+jacintafor> its a process
[2:01:42] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt that's what spells do.
[2:01:43] <+EndgameContent> Spells proc before combat
[2:01:45] <Chaossheep> Haha this is a cool setup, Ekko is all fucky
[2:01:45] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt don't question the tutorial
[2:01:45] <NiktenKing> It's a SPELL ATTACK
[2:01:45] <%Buzzard42> WeSmart
[2:01:46] <Sayer_Raider> Blocking doesn't deal damage
[2:01:47] <%Treuan> That's fair
[2:01:49] <Spiritttz> Wording has issues for sure
[2:01:50] <+Lozzu> it's a spell
[2:01:50] <$Trenr> no, you can make him strike anyone in combat before combat actually happens
[2:01:51] <%Ninestempest> ALL SPELLS GO BEFORE COMBAT
[2:01:53] <$galaxyswirl> no?
[2:01:53] <@SoFarFetched> keywords are very important
[2:01:54] <scrublord009> @PatStaresAt with overwhelm, if the blockers dies, the attack continues
[2:01:55] <%moogleboy1984> you've had problems where you didn't RTFC?
[2:01:56] <j0ustar> fair
[2:01:56] <%Mendin> Never teach Pat how to play Magic
[2:01:58] <BlackermanZX> So this part is just Darius dunking some fools
[2:01:58] <lvl10cybermancer> Yeah this game is terrible with wording to be fair
[2:01:58] <reonome> ive had that issue ngl
[2:01:59] <+pectusumbra> they have been making passes on that I read
[2:02:00] <ha2ken> Card descriptions are dumb
[2:02:01] <+OblivionSword1> I have the same problem ass well sometimes
[2:02:02] <iosephe> Puzzle time
[2:02:07] <crimsonsaens> Text in this game is unclear, but you only had one option there anyway
[2:02:08] <nepwar> that's common last i played runterra. text sometimes don't give critical info
[2:02:10] <qo_op> it says strike not attack. the text symantics are pretty good
[2:02:13] <%Buzzard42> reading the card explains the card
[2:02:15] <SilentEric> Always put darius last.
[2:02:16] <lvl10cybermancer> It's not like Magic where the card text is super mechanical and clear
[2:02:19] <%arancet> this is about order of operations
[2:02:19] <+CelioHogane> NOOO
[2:02:20] <+jacintafor> remember order matters
[2:02:20] <+azure22900> The tutorial is wrong anyway. YOUR ATTACK WILL FIZZLE OUT in a real match.
[2:02:24] <+chase959> no darisu second
[2:02:26] <crimsonsaens> Bad order
[2:02:28] <lvl10cybermancer> Cards will sometimes use different terms for the same thing for no reason
[2:02:32] <DrStinkers> Pat did you know about the magic eye in the left?
[2:02:35] <SilentEric> @azure22900 You are wrong
[2:02:36] <%Ninestempest> @azure22900 not against grample
[2:02:38] <Kalcom> it won't, he has overwhelm
[2:02:39] <%Buzzard42> @azure22900 not with Overwhelm it won't
[2:02:39] <%Ninestempest> trample*
[2:02:40] <+malacante> @azure22900 It won't fizzle because darius has overwhelm
[2:02:41] <Saturdaythe14th> Overwhelm attacks don't fizzle out @azure22900
[2:02:41] <Spiritttz> As a Magic player ive known that Overwhelm/Trample goes over dead blockers for a 15 years so not like i have any right not be mad you done
[2:02:42] <%Ninestempest> trample ignores
[2:02:45] <%Buzzard42> this is the Overwhelm tutorial
[2:02:46] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Im repeatng myself, but you need to learn not to play your burst spells until AFTER the enemy has declared blockers.
[2:02:47] <+gralho> YEX
[2:02:47] <SilentEric> Attacks don't fizzle out with overwhelm
[2:02:49] <T_Sasquatch> Ew Darius
[2:02:50] <%Ninestempest> I learned this the fucking hard way
[2:02:51] <Hellarussian> reading thing explains thing
[2:02:53] <+azure22900> YOu're all wrong they fizzle

[2:04:06] <SilentEric> Combat goes left to right. You need Darius to level up before he swings.
[2:04:08] <%TrebassTV> LOL
[2:04:08] <lvl10cybermancer> Attacks go off from left to right

[2:07:17] <thetruenicster> Thinking Breaks The Pat
[2:07:18] <reonome> DARIUS WILL LEVEL UP
[2:07:18] <Louie_Salmon> You will see
[2:07:18] <%BestTeaMaker> attack order, left to right
[2:07:18] <%Nameloc1667> No, left to right.
[2:07:18] <Hellarussian> for his passive
[2:07:19] <+DinnerCalzone> Now he levels up BEFORE he attacks
[2:07:19] <+klassikFrank> YOUR BUFF GIVES OVERWHELM
[2:07:19] <$TheSmerdis> Attack order matters
[2:07:20] <%aishman> use MIGHt
[2:07:20] <DrStinkers> darius levels up mid combat
[2:07:20] <nepwar> oh no pat found the puzzel in a card game
[2:07:20] <dinnydanny777> dig up
[2:07:20] <Zombrocom> OH MY GOD PAT
[2:07:21] <+gralho> NO
[2:07:21] <+jacintafor> youll see
[2:07:21] <%strugglepunk2> OVERWHELM
[2:07:21] <lvl10cybermancer> read darius
[2:07:21] <$TheSmerdis> Just watch
[2:07:21] <+CelioHogane> NO IT WILL NOT
[2:07:22] <+OblivionSword1> the attack order is from left to right
[2:07:22] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt BUT DARIUS LEVELS UP BEFORE HE ATTACKS
[2:07:22] <+klassikFrank> GIVE IT TO THE FIRST GUY
[2:07:23] <+chase959> it's about getting lethal
[2:07:23] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt BUFF THE REGULAR GUY AND ATTACK
[2:07:23] <+gralho> worng
[2:07:23] <%heartlesshealer> THE DIFFERENCE IS IT'S ONE TURN YOU ORB
[2:07:23] <+Lozzu> attack order
[2:07:23] <%MSN04_Sazabi> DARIUS WILL LEVEL UP BEFORE HIS ATTACL
[2:07:24] <scrublord009> DARIUS LEVEL UP
[2:07:24] <+Ritsu_sohma> ATTACK RESOLVES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
[2:07:24] <$galaxyswirl> WRONG
[2:07:25] <%arancet> but the nexus will be hurt MORE
[2:07:25] <%Tallie> youll see the difference
[2:07:25] <crimsonsaens> You'll kill the enemy nexus
[2:07:25] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt turn order is left to right
[2:07:26] <%Papa_Tak> fights are one at a time not all at the same time
[2:07:26] <+gralho> WRONG
[2:07:26] <%crimsonharvest> BIG BABA
[2:07:27] <%bevyrage> darius is going to level up before he attacks, which is A BIG DIFFERENCE PAT
[2:07:27] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt spells go first. We've been over this.
[2:07:27] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> LEFT TO RIGHT, READING ORDER
[2:07:28] <Kalcom> stop pretending
[2:07:28] <Spiritttz> BUT DARIUSE WILL LEVEL BEFORE HER HITS
[2:07:28] <%Leodude> Click on blue Eye
[2:07:30] <anentirecrab> @PatStaresAt they arent the order they die occurs differently read darius level up trigger
[2:07:30] <MyNameIsRasus> BABA
[2:07:30] <%Mendin> Pat they resolve one at a time
[2:07:31] <Hellarussian> read his passive
[2:07:31] <+gralho> YESSS
[2:07:32] <%kp539000> attack order left to right, you need to trample with first guy to level up darius
[2:07:32] <Saturdaythe14th> READ CARDS IN CARD GAME
[2:07:34] <PKHTjim> The enemy unit will die before your champion gets to level up this way.
[2:07:35] <%Ninestempest> RTFC
[2:07:37] <%Leodude> Hover over Blue eye
[2:07:37] <%heartlesshealer> Now they BOTH have Overwhelm
[2:07:38] <qo_op> the brain is running hard
[2:07:38] <kamichilli> BRUUHHHH
[2:07:39] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Not true. Before Darius was leveling after his strike, so he was missing the 4 damage you needed to win.
[2:07:40] <%Gogogolem> NO!
[2:07:40] <crimsonsaens> Kill soldier blocker
[2:07:41] <TyrantBelial> BUT BABA IS RED
[2:07:42] <+gralho> YESSSS
[2:07:42] <%crimsonharvest> yeah rtfc is basically it
[2:07:43] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Darius levels up the INSTANT the opponent Nexus hits 10, so he will do MORE damage if he attacks after that happens
[2:07:43] <reonome> darius will level up and get enough damage to kill the nexus
[2:07:45] <%baronblank> read the cards pat
[2:07:46] <SGrim> HE DID IT
[2:07:47] <crimsonsaens> yes
[2:07:47] <BlackermanZX> @PatStaresAt darius will level up thanks to the other dude attacking first
[2:07:48] <$TheSmerdis> Now, watch
[2:07:51] <%Ninestempest> HE DID ITTTTT
[2:07:52] <Zombrocom> Pat what the fuck is wrong with you
[2:07:52] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt It's order of operation dude. It's important because now Darious is Leveled up
[2:07:53] <$galaxyswirl> GOOD JOB BABI
[2:07:53] <$Trenr> oh my fucking god
[2:07:57] <%AnIrishPapaya> Jesus Christ
[2:07:58] <%Nekros4442> Now it's a one turn KO
[2:07:59] <Frostydough1> NOW DARIUS LEVELS UP BEFORE HIS FIGHT SO HE HAS TRAMP;LE
[2:08:00] <Hellarussian> oh no
[2:08:00] <+Lozzu> oh my god
[2:08:01] <%Ninestempest> OH MY GOD
[2:08:02] <%arancet> nexus hurt MORE
[2:08:03] <+azure22900> Units ATTACK LEFT to RIGHT
[2:08:03] <$galaxyswirl> HOW
[2:08:05] <%Nekros4442> PAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO KILL HIM IN ONE TURN
[2:08:05] <restingbones> Try again
[2:08:05] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt that's on you.
[2:08:05] <%Ninestempest> LEFT GOES FIRST
[2:08:05] <iosephe> But Baba!
[2:08:05] <%TrebassTV> OH MY GOD
[2:08:05] <reonome> PAT YOU STUMBO
[2:08:06] <%silverira> holy shit
[2:08:06] <Kalcom> DO IT AGAIN
[2:08:07] <+chase959> to get lethal
[2:08:07] <%spitelite> are you for fucking real
[2:08:08] <%heartlesshealer> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:08:08] <%crimsonharvest> You didnt read so you dont get it.
[2:08:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Oh my fucking god
[2:08:08] <scrublord009> OMG LUL
[2:08:09] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> @PatStaresAt the diffrence is you get him under 10 hp and darius levels up and get the atack power to kill
[2:08:09] <DrStinkers> Dariuus leveled up before he struck
[2:08:09] <%Nekros4442> THATS WHY YOU FAILED BEFORE
[2:08:10] <twoto858> You needed to level up Darius before attacking
[2:08:10] <qo_op> LUL LUL LUL
[2:08:10] <zamzoph> DO IT AGAIN
[2:08:10] <negaswarmlord> You buffed his power mid attack
[2:08:11] <Saturdaythe14th> Baba was you all along
[2:08:11] <reonome> DO IT AGAIN
[2:08:11] <%kp539000> do it again
[2:08:11] <+the_krypto_knight> Does Pat not understand left and right LUL
[2:08:12] <+klassikFrank> THINGS RESOLVE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
[2:08:12] <+CelioHogane> @PatStaresAt BECAUSE YOU DEALT MORE DAMAGE
[2:08:12] <Hellarussian> oh he stumbo
[2:08:12] <TheFakeBob> it goes left to right, the other guy attacked first to level Darius
[2:08:13] <haisho> the big stumbo
[2:08:13] <%Tallie> darius had more dmaage because he levelled up before he attacked
[2:08:13] <%Ninestempest> ATTACKS PLAY OUT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
[2:08:14] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> UNITS GO LET TO RIGHT, THIS ISN'T HARD
[2:08:15] <Daxalog> Attack order matters.
[2:08:15] <+chase959> you wanted the lethal and you weren't doing th lethal
[2:08:16] <%Agami23> darius leveled up before attacking. making youw in
[2:08:16] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Delete the game Pat, this isn't going anywhere LUL
[2:08:16] <+jacintafor> @PatStaresAt darius leveled up then attacked instead of attacking then leveling up
[2:08:16] <crimsonsaens> You can level up Darius mid combat to deal more damage
[2:08:18] <Spiritttz> one persone needs to explain this
[2:08:18] <zedravan> do it again
[2:08:19] <Louie_Salmon> Literally what don't you understand
[2:08:19] <restingbones> Do it until you understand
[2:08:19] <%Nobrev> LEFT CARD GOES FIRST
[2:08:19] <%TrebassTV> HIS OVERWHELM DAMAGE GOES THROUGH THEIR HEALTH AND TO THE NEXUS
[2:08:20] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> It wanted you to kill the nexus in one round
[2:08:21] <+OblivionSword1> darius can level up mid attck if hthe nexus is below 10
[2:08:22] <lvl10cybermancer> Because the other creature hit first, Darius leveled up BEFORE he attacked
[2:08:22] <T_Sasquatch> I really wouldn't blame pat LUL
[2:08:22] <$TheSmerdis> Units attack LEFT TO RIGHT always, and champs can level mid attack
[2:08:22] <%heartlesshealer> OPTIMIZATION
[2:08:22] <Tempmael> he level up and do big damage
[2:08:22] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt ATTACKING WITH DARIUS SECOND MADE HIM LEVEL UP BEFORE THE ATTACK
[2:08:23] <%bevyrage> because darius leveled up BEFORE he attacked, he got the buff which let you win the game IN THE ROUND like the tutorial wanted you to
[2:08:23] <%djblue_shift> jesus
[2:08:25] <dildozerfred> Lmao
[2:08:26] <rcand9> you overwhelmed i think
[2:08:27] <IamGrapes> now we just need paige to yell BUT DARIUS IS YOU
[2:08:27] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Before, Darius was striking first. So he leveled up AFTER his hit. So you were missing 4 damage you needed for lethal
[2:08:28] <kamichilli> FFS SAKE
[2:08:29] <MyNameIsRasus> Attacks go left to right, order matters
[2:08:29] <nepwar> LUL
[2:08:29] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt It's order of operation dude. It's important because now Darious is Leveled up
[2:08:30] <%Papa_Tak> if something on the left changes the board it affects the cards on the right
[2:08:30] <SataruYamate> because darius hit second he leveled uyp before he attacked and was able to make lethal
[2:08:31] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt Units attack left to right in that order. Darius needed dmaage to level up to deal more damage to kill nexus.
[2:08:32] <NiktenKing> Attacks go from LEFT to RIGHT, you can trigger level up and skills in order
[2:08:32] <%Leodude> Play it again.
[2:08:34] <+xddddsorandom> Because for Darius to activate you need to deal damage so if you deal damage with Darius he's already attacked so he doesn't level up
[2:08:34] <+RandomMishaps> @PatStaresAt Because the minion attacked first which gave darius his buff so that his attack was stronger when he went
[2:08:35] <%Mendin> PAIGE PLEASE HELP HIM
[2:08:35] <%baronblank> darius got overwhelm before attacking and thus killed the opponent through the blocker
[2:08:36] <%heartlesshealer> It's literally just optimization Pat
[2:08:37] <%GarbageNirvana> The first attack leveled up Darius so you could make it a one turn lethal
[2:08:37] <%TheQButton> Overwhelm
[2:08:39] <%heartlesshealer> do it again
[2:08:39] <%Broand> is emlo winning at card games
[2:08:39] <yesitsben> attack order matters, since the little guy attacked before darius, it leveled him up so he could do enough damage to clear
[2:08:41] <Kalcom> DO IT AGAIN
[2:08:41] <%spitelite> do it again until you get it
[2:08:41] <+EndgameContent> Pat you should probably play it again
[2:08:43] <Saturdaythe14th> Darius gained 4 attack by leveling up, which caused lethal.
[2:08:43] <xiccy> yo stop yelling. it doesn't help
[2:08:44] <Monstanimation> IQ Potato
[2:08:44] <+chase959> big boy zoom don't understand ECG
[2:08:45] <scrublord009> @PatStaresAt If you didn't get it do it again maybe
[2:08:45] <+EndgameContent> It's important to understand
[2:08:47] <Englishstew> damage is not resolved simultaneous, which means that level ups can trigger mid-fight
[2:08:49] <PKHTjim> The challenge was to win in one turn. By the smaller unit ot the left attacking and killing their enemy unit, your champion levels up.
[2:08:50] <$galaxyswirl> ???

[2:08:54] <+R_BChe> what
[2:08:55] <$TheSmerdis> You damaged the nexus enough to level up Darius BEFORE he attacked, so he leveled THEN attacked

[2:08:55] <%Binary_Fireball> because it's your choice to put them in order

[2:09:01] <$TheSmerdis> YOU PICK THE ORDER THEY FIGHT PAT
[2:09:02] <zamzoph> Being in your hand doesn't matter
[2:09:02] <bearking05> WHAT
[2:09:02] <LordWaldemaart> ?????????????
[2:09:03] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt If Darius strikes second, then the first overwhelm levels up Darius, so he hits for more damage.
[2:09:03] <%kp539000> it's the order you assign attackers
[2:09:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Since the other guy attacked before Darius, it means he triggered Darius to level up before Darius attacked
[2:09:04] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt i think you mean Back Field
[2:09:04] <lvl10cybermancer> You get to choose what order WHEN you attack
[2:09:05] <Zombrocom> THE HAND DOESNT MATTER
[2:09:05] <%strugglepunk2> because you choose that order pat
[2:09:05] <%redrins> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:09:06] <%BestTeaMaker> the hand doesn't matter, it's on the field
[2:09:07] <%Ninestempest> it's just when they ATTACK MY DUDE
[2:09:08] <+Toshatron> it's the order you play them to attack
[2:09:08] <dildozerfred> LOL
[2:09:08] <scrublord009> You can change turn orders
[2:09:08] <Spiritttz> Hand doesnt matter
[2:09:09] <Hellarussian> man what the fuck LUL
[2:09:09] <%spitelite> hand doesn't matter
[2:09:09] <%heartlesshealer> PAT THE GRANDMA
[2:09:09] <iosephe> Oh no the goblins
[2:09:09] <%Mendin> If you click-drag them all, they show up in space order
[2:09:10] <BlackermanZX> @PatStaresAt Darius had to lvl up just to deal a bit more of damage and kill in one turn
[2:09:11] <%bevyrage> pat you can declare attacking order when you attack. it doesn't matter what order they're in when on standby
[2:09:11] <NiktenKing> Because you can CHOOSE attack order
[2:09:11] <%Ninestempest> THEY ATTACK FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
[2:09:12] <reonome> THEY ATTACK THE ORDER YOU PLACE THEM ON THE FIELD
[2:09:12] <+R_BChe> hand dorsnt matter
[2:09:12] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt they order you put in the field is the one that matters
[2:09:13] <nepwar> the hand is just for you
[2:09:13] <crimsonsaens> It doesn't matter in the hand
[2:09:15] <lambishly> Elmo cam
[2:09:15] <SGrim> The hand does not matter,
[2:09:15] <+DinnerCalzone> Because you pick their order when you attack
[2:09:15] <+MajorCrasher> because they're in your hand and not the field pat
[2:09:15] <$Trenr> IT MATTERS WHAT ORDER YOU TELL THEM TO ATTACK HOLY SHIT
[2:09:15] <%GarbageNirvana> BUT BABA
[2:09:17] <dildozerfred> LUL LUL LUL
[2:09:17] <crimsonsaens> Not this bug
[2:09:17] <$TheSmerdis> THE HAND DOESNT MATTE, YOU CAN ORDER IT HOWEVER YOU LIKE
[2:09:17] <nepwar> its order on the green field
[2:09:18] <+klassikFrank> WELL, THERE GOES THAT LESSON
[2:09:19] <%Buzzard42> @patstaresat because you can control what order they attack in, regardless of what order you played them in
[2:09:20] <+hartowallu> Pat u lookin good bruvv
[2:09:22] <%MSN04_Sazabi> BUT WHO IS BABA
[2:09:22] <%aishman> Because it doesn't matter in the hand, it only matters when you ATTACK
[2:09:23] <scrublord009> WHAT IS THIS DECK LUL
[2:09:23] <viewtifulr> paige make him unbderstand
[2:09:25] <dinnydanny777> Oh so this is kind of like Gwent
[2:09:28] <ravencloak13> Why the fuck would the hand matter?
[2:09:29] <+chase959> the battlefield matters not the order of your hand
[2:09:29] <negaswarmlord> The order in hand doesn't matter
[2:09:29] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt Back Field/ Bench placement only matters if specified on card text
[2:09:36] <anentirecrab> @PatStaresAt thats a genuine complaint as someone who messes with his board constantly in magic when summoning stuff but it only matters when you go to combat
[2:09:37] <crimsonsaens> There's a bug where you can queue up for the wrong mode
[2:09:37] <%YakumoYomi> psaBig psaHoldon
[2:09:38] <PKHTjim> You can pick the order on attack step.
[2:09:39] <%emperordread> It's like reading, it resolves from left to right
[2:09:39] <%Broand> its a tutorial
[2:09:41] <restingbones> What the fuck
[2:09:42] <negaswarmlord> What matter is the order on the field itself
[2:09:42] <%Ninestempest> LOOOOOOOOL
[2:09:43] <+jacintafor> wtf
[2:09:43] <%Papa_Tak> the order on the bench and order in combat dont matter
[2:09:43] <NiktenKing> Hand order doesn't matter, ATTACK ORDER is chosen
[2:09:43] <%crimsonharvest> they're not doing anything in your hand why would their position matter there, they're not played yet
[2:09:44] <twoto858> Uh oh
[2:09:46] <%BestTeaMaker> uuuuuh
[2:09:47] <SGrim> The bench exists in the order you played the cards. Left is earliest, right is latest.

[2:09:58] <%kp539000> it's a bug, just reselect that mission again
[2:09:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Big bugs
[2:09:59] <masterfire23> man elmo is really confused by this game
[2:09:59] <%crimsonharvest> what

[2:10:08] <+pectusumbra> okay guess you have to restart
[2:10:11] <Louie_Salmon> Hoo boy
[2:10:12] <DrStinkers> the order of declared attackers is different from the back row
[2:10:12] <%emperordread> You're trapped in the Izanagi of the Uchiha clan
[2:10:16] <Hellarussian> aww shit here we go again
[2:10:17] <zamzoph> we have to go back
[2:10:19] <%Leodude> The blue eye is your friend.
[2:10:20] <Spiritttz> \How unfortunate
[2:10:23] <lvl10cybermancer> Trapped in the new world of Street Fighter 3
[2:10:26] <%kp539000> @emperordread yesss xD
[2:10:29] <+Sushi2k> You have to play with those cards in the tutorial iirc?
[2:10:30] <+chase959> Riot fix ur games. "two new lux skins?"
[2:10:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Pay attention to Nexus Health
[2:10:39] <%bevyrage> so pat, the way it works is that only while you're attacking does it matter what order your cards are in. if they're on standby/in your hand then there's no reason to order them at all.
[2:10:43] <%crimsonharvest> Pat defeated by preconceptions once again where careful reading was required
[2:10:47] <nepwar> darius is doing pierce dmg
[2:10:47] <scrublord009> This is why I don't use the key shortcuts
[2:10:48] <twoto858> Also pay attention to how Darius levels up
[2:10:48] <NiktenKing> I forget, does Shen have a tutorial?
[2:10:50] <+DinnerCalzone> A functioning client. Post this to scare a Rioter
[2:10:50] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Hand order doesn't matter. You choose order of attackers when you put them out. Darius levels when their nexus is 10 health, so you need him to STRIKE after the first guy STRIKES. This gives you more damage mid combat.
[2:10:59] <%Nameloc1667> Pat, what you are calling the "Hand" is the "Field". The Field is the order cards are summoned. When attacking, the order you drag them to the "Battlefield" determines their attacking orders. You needed Darius to level BEFORE attacking, so you would kill on that turn, which means your other unit needed to deal damage to reduce the enemy Nexus below 10.
[2:11:00] <MyNameIsRasus> Read how Darius levels up
[2:11:01] <+Double_Tap_That> !uptime
[2:11:01] <+CelioHogane> @Ninestempest ...is shen in the game?
[2:11:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 11m.
[2:11:04] <%Nekros4442> No Pat...
[2:11:06] <Louie_Salmon> That wouldn't be the same
[2:11:06] <+klassikFrank> IT IS NOT A QUICK ATTACK
[2:11:06] <$Trenr> but it doesn't
[2:11:06] <%Nekros4442> It's different
[2:11:07] <%redrins> its not the same as quick attack
[2:11:07] <iosephe> No, it's different
[2:11:08] <@commanderclaw> They're different things
[2:11:09] <SomeAsianDood> but it doesn't give him quick attack....
[2:11:10] <%BestTeaMaker> they're different
[2:11:10] <%TrebassTV> it's not a quick attack, it's different
[2:11:11] <crimsonsaens> It's not quick attack
[2:11:11] <%strugglepunk2> that's not what it does at all man
[2:11:12] <reonome> ITS DIFFERENT
[2:11:13] <dinnydanny777> Rattata used quick attack
[2:11:13] <lvl10cybermancer> But you can strike enemes you arent' fighting
[2:11:13] <scrublord009> It's not quick attack
[2:11:13] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> strick and quick atack are diffrent
[2:11:14] <+Toshatron> it's not quick attack they don't hit back @PatStaresAt
[2:11:15] <%Ninestempest> @CelioHogane yes, he's really good atm too
[2:11:15] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt No, pat qucik attack only strikes once.
[2:11:16] <%Bane_Kaikyo> IT's NOT a quick attack!!
[2:11:16] <+jacintafor> @PatStaresAt it can attack units it's not facing
[2:11:16] <MyNameIsRasus> It's different
[2:11:16] <Chaossheep> pat no it's "deal this guy's attack as damage to something"
[2:11:16] <%Piratekittycat98> thats not what it does
[2:11:17] <$Trenr> it makes him hit AN enemy, not HIS enemy
[2:11:17] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> Oh boy
[2:11:18] <iosephe> It's an additional attack
[2:11:18] <NiktenKing> It's not a quick attack tho
[2:11:18] <%Nekros4442> Strike and Quick Attack are different keywors for a reason
[2:11:19] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt it's different, he attacks before the other attack
[2:11:20] <+klassikFrank> USE WHAT YOU LEARNED
[2:11:21] <SilentEric> You can strike diagonally even if you aren't blocking that target.
[2:11:21] <%heartlesshealer> a SPELL is not an ATTACK.
[2:11:23] <Spiritttz> But this way he dies before block so overwhelm does more damage
[2:11:23] <apolitenoob> Quick attack is genuinely a different mechanic, if you keep calling it that you're gonna get confused man
[2:11:23] <%spitelite> strike is just dealing dirrect damage
[2:11:26] <NiktenKing> You can cast strikes from anywhere
[2:11:27] <%arancet> ALLY strikes, enemy does not
[2:11:27] <lvl10cybermancer> You can hit any enemy
[2:11:29] <%TrebassTV> Quick attack they get to retaliate
[2:11:29] <reonome> ITS AND EXTRA ATTACK
[2:11:30] <%Nekros4442> Strike is just direct dmg
[2:11:34] <%Piratekittycat98> no its strikeing before
[2:11:35] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt this is an additonal FREE hit.
[2:11:35] <%Nobrev> NotLikeThis
[2:11:36] <%Ninestempest> @PatStaresAt think of it as a spell that just does damage before attacks resolve
[2:11:38] <negaswarmlord> Striking is just doing the damage of your selected ally to the selected enemy. you can target someone blocking someone else with it
[2:11:40] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> Its an extra attack on top
[2:11:40] <restingbones> a Strike
[2:11:46] <SomeAsianDood> It's just deal a unit's power to another unit
[2:11:49] <%strugglepunk2> it's just do this unit's attack as damage
[2:11:50] <+mmack093> Pat are you ok?
[2:11:50] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt If quick attack doesn't kill, the opponent hits back
[2:11:50] <+klassikFrank> A strike is just applying your damage to the enemy, it's not an attack
[2:11:51] <nechronia> You can use it while defending and it can hit cards it's not attacking
[2:11:51] <%emperordread> Baba doesn't matter, YOU matter
[2:11:51] <%heartlesshealer> IT'S A SPELL
[2:11:52] <PKHTjim> Strike is a spell that deals damage by power.
[2:11:53] <NiktenKing> Strikes can happen from any location
[2:11:54] <bearking05> re read what things do
[2:11:54] <%redrins> "deal damage to a unit using another units attack value" there
[2:11:54] <%Tallie> pat its fine just dont use noxus later on lol
[2:11:55] <Louie_Salmon> It literally just deals damage
[2:11:56] <+k95zero> @PatStaresAt They don't strike each other. One strikes the other.
[2:11:57] <lvl10cybermancer> Strike means that he deals his damage
[2:11:58] <+Toshatron> quick attack means you go first, strike is your dude smacks them and that's it @PatStaresAt
[2:11:58] <$TheSmerdis> Strike does not trigget overwhelm
[2:11:58] <iosephe> It's damage based on the power of the creature
[2:11:59] <crimsonsaens> Whirling Death basically says: deals damage based on an ally's attack
[2:11:59] <%Mendin> Pat if you were attacking with creatures A and B, and they were being blocked by enemy A and B, you cuold use that spell to have A hit B before actual combat resolves
[2:12:00] <+EndgameContent> It just hits their health with the unit's power
[2:12:00] <Kalcom> Kill the core
[2:12:01] <+zepelinnn1> strike is not clear for me as well
[2:12:02] <%Broand> oh no I don't understand any fof these keywords aaa
[2:12:02] <%Papa_Tak> no
[2:12:04] <reonome> YOUR ALLY WILL JUST HIT THEM, THATS IT
[2:12:04] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt It is similar to quick attack in function in some cases. You are right.
[2:12:05] <%TrebassTV> no
[2:12:06] <%heartlesshealer> Pat why
[2:12:07] <%Nameloc1667> It's not combat, it's just a free hit.
[2:12:07] <%spitelite> strike deals dammage without combat
[2:12:07] <reonome> THATS WHAT STRIKE MEANS
[2:12:09] <scrublord009> It's the way the card work
[2:12:09] <Saturdaythe14th> Reading card games is a cruel and unusual challenge
[2:12:09] <$TheSmerdis> Its not battle, its just a strike, they aren't striking you back
[2:12:10] <+EndgameContent> Because they don't strike EACH OTHER
[2:12:11] <%TrebassTV> darius played last
[2:12:12] <%Leodude> We need to have him hover over the oracle eye.
[2:12:12] <%bevyrage> it's a ranged attack, what you expect them to swing a sword and hit yah back from twenty feet away?
[2:12:14] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> Its like an assist
[2:12:14] <+OblivionSword1> think of it as the spell dealing damage using the unit power
[2:12:14] <DrStinkers> attacking is technically "units strike each ohter"
[2:12:14] <Lancaster_H> read darius' level up @PatStaresAt
[2:12:15] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt pretend that's a fireball whose damage is dependent on the card you use with it
[2:12:16] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> you need to see how other strike cards work to see what we mean @PatStaresAt
[2:12:16] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Strike just means "deal damage equal to its attack to"
[2:12:16] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt So look at Darius level up condition first.
[2:12:17] <%Ninestempest> Okay pat, please explain what you do not get here
[2:12:17] <MyNameIsRasus> That's what strike means
[2:12:18] <%kp539000> that would be both units striking each other, this spell has darius just striking one uint
[2:12:19] <+jacintafor> let him think chat
[2:12:20] <+EndgameContent> Compare to Single Combat, which makes both units strike each other
[2:12:21] <NiktenKing> Read Darius now
[2:12:22] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt the order that you put IN THE FIELD matters, not the one in the hand
[2:12:23] <+klassikFrank> Pat, what don't you understand? I don't know what we need to explain
[2:12:24] <Kalcom> let him do it
[2:12:25] <%Nekros4442> The goal of this puzzle is to win in one round
[2:12:28] <scrublord009> Let him figure it out
[2:12:30] <Winner_92> @patstaresat strike means you hit them, but they don’t hit you. When they attack and you block that’s both units striking
[2:12:30] <%Buzzard42> @PatStaresAt "Strike" means a unit deals their damage to another target, but is not hit back in return
[2:12:32] <%linSP> is this first strike from mtg
[2:12:35] <qo_op> its big
[2:12:37] <$Trenr> Have Darius attack first, and then figure out why he doesn't get overwhelm and why you don't win
[2:12:38] <nepwar> i mean it shows a visual of draven throwing axes and then darius hitting. i don't see the confusion
[2:12:39] <MyNameIsRasus> You have to win in one round
[2:12:39] <dildozerfred> Big brain time
[2:12:40] <+azure22900> Units attack Left to Right, effects and abilities go into that order.
[2:12:40] <+klassikFrank> But then it wouldn't be enough to kill him
[2:12:40] <reonome> read darius' level up condition
[2:12:40] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Darius would level up too late to get the extra damage.
[2:12:41] <%Nekros4442> Yes, but you wouldnt kill the enemy
[2:12:41] <+CelioHogane> BUT THE NEXUS WOULD NOT GET DESTROYED
[2:12:41] <BlackermanZX> BUT.. he doesnt lvl up first
[2:12:41] <%Nameloc1667> Yes, but not enough damage to kill if you do it in that order
[2:12:41] <%Papa_Tak> soldier goes first, soldier puts enemy nexus to under 10 which changes darius BEFORE darius attacks
[2:12:42] <+jacintafor> darius wouldn't level up
[2:12:42] <twoto858> But it wouldn't be enough damage
[2:12:42] <Kalcom> but what if he levels up first
[2:12:43] <%Ninestempest> RTFC
[2:12:43] <%heartlesshealer> attack = attack, strike = do damage using the unit, spell =/= attack despite strike
[2:12:43] <%Leodude> @PatStaresAt When you see the blue eye to the left hover over it, it shows what will happen.
[2:12:48] <+CelioHogane> WHAT
[2:12:48] <+zepelinnn1> but Darius does not level up if you use him first
[2:12:49] <%Fooguwu> ........
[2:12:50] <+CelioHogane> WHY
[2:12:51] <%Ninestempest> PAT
[2:12:53] <%Nekros4442> Why does it matter
[2:12:54] <+CelioHogane> WHY PAT
[2:12:54] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah you literally just do it
[2:12:54] <%Papa_Tak> that doesnt matter
[2:12:55] <Daebunz> it doesnt matter what order its in when its in your hand
[2:12:56] <reonome> YES YOU DUMBO
[2:12:57] <%Ninestempest> IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT ORDER THEY ARE IN BEFORE ATTACKING
[2:12:58] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt HAND ORDER DOESN'T MATTER PAT
[2:12:59] <%MSN04_Sazabi> THE ORDER IN YOUR HAND DOESN'T MATTER PAT
[2:13:00] <%Binary_Fireball> yaaay
[2:13:00] <$ItsRatman> OMG THE MIND GOBLINS ARE HERE
[2:13:00] <%spitelite> the hand doesn't matter you goblin
[2:13:00] <+azure22900> It doesnt matter pat.
[2:13:01] <Daxalog> You can rearange them from the middle
[2:13:01] <%crimsonharvest> but why its irrelevant
[2:13:01] <ScatterCatt> But....that literally doesn't matter to reorder them.
[2:13:01] <%Broand> Ah, mind goblens
[2:13:03] <j0ustar> oh Pat
[2:13:04] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> But that doesnt matter :(
[2:13:04] <%BestTeaMaker> pat, that doesn't matter lol
[2:13:04] <BlackermanZX> yeah
[2:13:04] <+chase959> it doesn't matter
[2:13:05] <reonome> THAT DOESN'T MATTER
[2:13:06] <%strugglepunk2> yeah but that doesn't matter
[2:13:06] <$galaxyswirl> @PatStaresAt that literally doesnt matter
[2:13:06] <+SinisterBroccoli> That doesn't matter
[2:13:07] <vivaldiva> LUL LUL LUL
[2:13:07] <SilentEric> Or the order you click and drag to pick them up
[2:13:08] <NiktenKing> YES
[2:13:09] <%TrebassTV> IT GOES LEFT TO RIGHT
[2:13:09] <%Nobrev> pat hand order does not matter
[2:13:09] <twoto858> It doesn't really matter, but sure
[2:13:09] <%Papa_Tak> what?
[2:13:10] <Spiritttz> eh if that helps fine
[2:13:11] <%Nameloc1667> The order in that area does not matter pat
[2:13:11] <%baronblank> I'm guessing the hand order is mind goblins
[2:13:11] <%corgispudmen> Read Darrus too
[2:13:12] <+chase959> that is just goblins
[2:13:12] <%Fooguwu> WHAT
[2:13:13] <+CelioHogane> ???????????
[2:13:13] <%TheQButton> You did it!
[2:13:14] <crimsonsaens> ????
[2:13:15] <%WhereIsWill> da ORB LEARNETH
[2:13:15] <+pectusumbra> right. G o b o l i n s

[2:13:38] <%heartlesshealer> HAND NO MATTER, FIELD MATTER
[2:13:39] <%djblue_shift> ON THE FIELD
[2:13:40] <Chaossheep> the order in your HANDS doesn't matter, the order on the BOARD does
[2:13:40] <%Nekros4442> The order matters on the field...not your bench
[2:13:40] <%Ninestempest> ONLY WHEN YOU DECLARE ATTACKS
[2:13:41] <@commanderclaw> Your hand isn't the same as the field
[2:13:41] <%Papa_Tak> thats not the attack board
[2:13:41] <+DinnerCalzone> On the field, not hand
[2:13:41] <twoto858> Not in the hand, in the placement
[2:13:41] <+klassikFrank> IT ONLY MATTERS WHEN YOU ATTACK, NOT WHEN THEy'RE DOWN THERE
[2:13:42] <%arancet> matter when attacking, not when on the bench
[2:13:42] <+jacintafor> @PatStaresAt Order on board not hand
[2:13:42] <+JonathLP> YOU CAN PLACE ON ANY SIDE
[2:13:42] <qo_op> oh no hes gonna sort his bench each game wont he
[2:13:43] <$TheSmerdis> You can put them on the field HOWEVER you like, they're not attacking yet
[2:13:43] <%baronblank> hand order and board attack order are different
[2:13:43] <Kalcom> ONE GUY
[2:13:43] <%MSN04_Sazabi> ON THE FIELD PAT
[2:13:43] <%strugglepunk2> FIELD ORDER MATTERS
[2:13:43] <crimsonsaens> Only when attacking
[2:13:44] <jimmytwofeet> YOU MATTER
[2:13:44] <Lancaster_H> ON THE BOARD NOT IN YOUR HAND
[2:13:44] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt HAND ORDER IS DIFFERENT FROM FIELD ORDER
[2:13:44] <%spitelite> order only matters on the field
[2:13:46] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt order in the front line matters, order in the backline does not
[2:13:46] <nepwar> no they meant the order on your hand doesn't matter but roder on field
[2:13:46] <%Fooguwu> HAND DOESNT MATTER
[2:13:46] <%WhereIsWill> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[2:13:47] <+malacante> you can put out your attackers in any order
[2:13:47] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt left to right only matters on the battlefield, not the standby
[2:13:47] <+Toshatron> only matters when declaring an attack
[2:13:47] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> Oh god
[2:13:47] <+azure22900> THERE IN YOUR HAND NOT ON THE FIELD
[2:13:47] <Daebunz> you drag them from hand to the field in whatever order you want
[2:13:48] <j0ustar> It's fine Pat it IS important. continue
[2:13:48] <negaswarmlord> The hand is different from the field Pat
[2:13:48] <$galaxyswirl> NO IN HAND ON THE FIELD IS WHERE IT MATTERS
[2:13:49] <lvl10cybermancer> IT'S FINE CHAT
[2:13:49] <+chase959> that is just visual
[2:13:49] <%Nordguy> order IN DECK doesn't matter. Its ON THE FIELD it matterd
[2:13:49] <+R_BChe> ONLY IN FIELD
[2:13:50] <%kp539000> yeah the order on grass matters, the order in grey doesn't
[2:13:50] <%strugglepunk2> HAND ORDER DOES NOT
[2:13:50] <lvl10cybermancer> THIS WORKS
[2:13:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Reordering things in the hand doesn't actually change shit BUT IT HELPS VISUALIZE THINGS if you have OCD or something.... Like Pat.... so
[2:13:52] <+EndgameContent> There's a difference between hand and field
[2:13:52] <%Buzzard42> @PatStaresAt the way you control who attacks is by pulling them out one at a time
[2:13:53] <dildozerfred> BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack
[2:13:53] <%Agami23> i think it matters on the field but not on the bench. or something?
[2:13:54] <Kalcom> 3
[2:13:54] <%Nameloc1667> Think of that as the "BENCH". The Bench doesn't matter, only the field.
[2:13:55] <bearking05> NOT ON THAT PLACE ON THE GRASS
[2:13:55] <ScatterCatt> Pat, the first unit you pull out is always on the LEFT, the next unit you pull out to attack goes to the RIGHT of the previous unit. ALWAYS.
[2:13:55] <+k95zero> @PatStaresAt How you ATTACK matter. How they are on the board doesn't matter
[2:13:55] <DrStinkers> Back row order is not declared attackers order
[2:13:56] <%TrebassTV> BEFORE YOU PLAY THEM ON THE FIELD, THEY SIT ON THE BENCH. THE ORDER ON THE BENCH DOES NOT MATTER
[2:13:57] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> It only matters when placed for attacking. Any point before that isn't relevant.
[2:13:57] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt HAND AND STANDBY DONT MATTER ONLY ON THE FIELD, I HAVE NEVER PLAYED THIS GAME AND I UNDERSTAND IT
[2:13:57] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt that only matters on the field not in your hand
[2:13:57] <JetpackMcQuack> kinamaRee
[2:13:57] <%crimsonharvest> pat pretend they're real cards for a minute
[2:13:57] <darkwolf_0> on the field
[2:13:58] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt No dude, they're in the bench, they're not attacking now but hey, you do what makes sense TO YOU
[2:13:58] <TinSilver> wow
[2:13:58] <zedravan> that is not the attack zone pat
[2:13:58] <LordWaldemaart> you drag them yourself
[2:13:59] <%Mendin> He doesn't understand the two places of On The Board
[2:13:59] <lvl10cybermancer> YOU'RE CONFUSING HIM MORE
[2:14:00] <%baronblank> the field order is what matters, hand order doesn't
[2:14:01] <+SinisterBroccoli> You are not attackiong right now right?
[2:14:01] <%redrins> when they're ATTACKING not on the board before attacking LUL
[2:14:02] <+Armeggadon> hand order literally does not matter, order only matters when you play them on the battlefield
[2:14:03] <nepwar> uh oh now more confusion
[2:14:04] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Hand order doesn't matter ever. Its the order on the field.
[2:14:04] <%corgispudmen> thast is not your hand
[2:14:04] <+marlborored5> this hurts
[2:14:05] <+JonathLP> You can place cards on either side
[2:14:06] <+chase959> not anything that matters. it is the battlefield that matters
[2:14:06] <%Papa_Tak> the only thing that matters is the front most board where you fight
[2:14:06] <scrublord009> Attack order is not Board order
[2:14:07] <%Nekros4442> Oh god we knew this was what was gonna happen
[2:14:07] <%emperordread> Field =/= Hand
[2:14:07] <reonome> THE ORDER MATTERS WHEN YOU PLACE THEM TO ATTACK
[2:14:07] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt stop saying HAND, it's your BACKLINE
[2:14:08] <T_Sasquatch> PLAY FROM THE BEGINNING AGAIN LUL
[2:14:09] <%Gogogolem> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[2:14:09] <qo_op> oh nonononono
[2:14:10] <BlackermanZX> @PatStaresAt its fine dont worry about that
[2:14:10] <JustAwayStew> is this some sort of joke?
[2:14:12] <iosephe> WELCOME TO CARD GAMES
[2:14:13] <%crimsonharvest> really though just pretend they're real cards
[2:14:13] <%heartlesshealer> Hand = ResidentSleeper Field attack order = psaFist
[2:14:13] <+pectusumbra> alright, everyone relax
[2:14:14] <+jacintafor> lets slow down chat
[2:14:15] <TyrantBelial> THERE'S YOUR HAND AND YOUR FIELD, THE FIELD CAN BE ORDERED,. THE HAND CANNOT BE, CUS TEH HAND ORDER IS MEANINGLESS
[2:14:15] <Fanciful_Unicorn> LUL
[2:14:16] <GoogleyGareth> jermaOld
[2:14:17] <Saturdaythe14th> The attacking zone and the backrow are different places, it's not a big deal
[2:14:18] <+Lazyjoules> Very yelling, much loud
[2:14:18] <+Memnarch7> Order only matters when attacking, no other time
[2:14:18] <+condor_fiend> the order only matters on the grass
[2:14:21] <@SoFarFetched> Chat you need to calm down. Cause this chat is moving TOO fast for pat to read. LUL
[2:14:23] <%bevyrage> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[2:14:23] <%Agami23> this is weirdly similar to pokemon
[2:14:23] <unclekulikov> Phone a friend!
[2:14:23] <PKHTjim> On the attack step it matters the most. They're just chilling when not in battle.
[2:14:24] <Louie_Salmon> THIS
[2:14:24] <%corgispudmen> the blue
[2:14:24] <Spiritttz> Slow mode
[2:14:26] <nepwar> green field= order matter, grey rock thing= wtv idk
[2:14:27] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt They attack in the order you make them attack. just drag them out one by one, and they will attack in that order.
[2:14:27] <%Buzzard42> @PatStaresAt Hand order is not attack order
[2:14:27] <+OblivionSword1> @PatStaresAt the middle one is the attacking field the bottom one is just the bench. only the attacking field order matter
[2:14:30] <+klassikFrank> Pat, those cards are currently in the bench. Order doesn't matter until you place them on the field to attack.
[2:14:30] <twoto858> The blue
[2:14:30] <JetpackMcQuack> uhnRee uhnRee uhnRee
[2:14:31] <+Xanadeas> it doesn't matter what order they are in your hand or on the bench. it matters what order they're in when they're on the field
[2:14:32] <lvl10cybermancer> Guys it's fine
[2:14:32] <apolitenoob> Bench is the stony party, field is the grass part. Order doesn't matter on the stone, order matters on the grass
[2:14:34] <crimsonsaens> They're on the bench/backline right now
[2:14:34] <SilentEric> Okay, defining terms. Hand, bench, battlefield.
[2:14:35] <%Nameloc1667> Can we go to Sub only while we try to help him??
[2:14:39] <bearking05> where they are now does not matter when you place to attack then it matters
[2:14:39] <%emperordread> Play pot of greed
[2:14:40] <Monstanimation> I can't LUL
[2:14:40] <IamGrapes> the backline is the stone area. the frontline is the grass area
[2:14:42] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt the field order is the one that matters, the order that you put them in the field, not the order that is in the hand
[2:14:45] <SilentEric> Bench order never matters.
[2:14:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> It help to visualize it guys
[2:14:47] <DougintheTrench> YOU'rE DPS IS TOO LOW MORE DOTS
[2:14:47] <%spitelite> is this pats shadow puzzles?
[2:14:48] <Louie_Salmon> This literally isn't the hand holy shit
[2:14:48] <%Ninestempest> @PatStaresAt Right now, your ally units are just sitting on the field. WHen you drag them up to ATTACK, that is when it matters what order you play them Right now, ti does not matter
[2:14:50] <TyrantBelial> They arei n the vbackline right now Pat
[2:14:53] <+strakillias> Mods set this to sub only so pat can read
[2:14:53] <ravencloak13> So guessing your one of those people who want their hands in line with their field huh?
[2:14:55] <GoogleyGareth> You can eat nachos quicker if you soak them in milk.
[2:14:56] <qo_op> this is the best
[2:14:56] <PKHTjim> There ya go.
[2:14:57] <TyrantBelial> the backline does not interact
[2:14:58] <Louie_Salmon> You can't just use words however you want
[2:14:58] <+pectusumbra> The order in the blue stone area doesn't matter. The grass part is where the order matters
[2:14:59] <PKHTjim> That works.
[2:15:02] <BlackermanZX> yeah
[2:15:04] <reonome> that works
[2:15:04] <%heartlesshealer> only grass order matters
[2:15:04] <%AnIrishPapaya> Phew
[2:15:05] <%Ninestempest> backline does'nt matter
[2:15:06] <IamGrapes> the grass area is the attacking field, the stone area is the place where the dudes sit there and chill
[2:15:07] <scrublord009> AND NOW WE KNOW
[2:15:13] <%strugglepunk2> @GoogleyGareth Good advice, I'll follow up on that man.
[2:15:14] <nepwar> aw man this is some dumb shit i luv it
[2:15:15] <Zombrocom> I don't understand what pat does not understand
[2:15:16] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Pat you need to eat Paige's drugs, you've become infected
[2:15:17] <%SirGO0SE> if theres grass on the field, play ball
[2:15:17] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> Just pretend youre holding the actual cards in your hand.

[2:15:46] <+klassikFrank> BUT YOU NEED TO CHANGE ATTACK ORDERS DEPENDING ON THE SECNARIO
[2:15:46] <negaswarmlord> The right order depends on you
[2:15:46] <+EndgameContent> What
[2:15:46] <%Broand> what?
[2:15:46] <+chase959> that changes the whole game tho
[2:15:47] <%crimsonharvest> what are you talking about its a deck of cards
[2:15:47] <ravencloak13> @zombrocom He wants to line up his hand with his attack order cause OCD.
[2:15:48] <restingbones> What do you mean?
[2:15:50] <+Tacowavable> It's kinda dumb you can't reorder your hand
[2:15:51] <%Piratekittycat98> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:15:51] <+neutralraff> goblin semantics
[2:15:51] <Saturdaythe14th> but... but BABA...
[2:15:52] <reonome> YOU DECIDE THE RIGHT ORDER
[2:15:53] <qo_op> the back line matters for goblins cause now pat knows he can sort his bench
[2:15:53] <%Nobrev> pat when you draw cards you get them at random from a shuffled deck
[2:15:53] <%strugglepunk2> You decide whatever order you want
[2:15:56] <restingbones> Lost again Pat
[2:15:56] <%TrebassTV> OMG
[2:15:57] <%heartlesshealer> It's like that to enable people to play wrong and lose based on skill
[2:15:57] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt So in order to get 14 damage in one attack, you need Darius to level up before he STRIKES. That is why the tutorial is teaching you stuff.
[2:15:57] <+DinnerCalzone> But the game doesn't know what order you want until you make the card attack...
[2:15:57] <twoto858> The player has to figure out the right order
[2:15:57] <+EyeFarted> but then the game is doing the work for you @PatStaresAt
[2:15:57] <+pectusumbra> you need to mix it up at times
[2:15:59] <SomeAsianDood> wait he failed
[2:15:59] <Kalcom> tfw fail
[2:16:00] <darkwolf_0> noooo
[2:16:03] <NiktenKing> @PatStaresAt No, Pat go look at Shen's abilities and combos and you'll see why
[2:16:05] <scrublord009> He forgot the spell LUL
[2:16:06] <BeNiceImShy> It's almost as if it's a really abstract and awkward mechanic
[2:16:07] <+CelioHogane> PAT, THE GAME DOESN'T READ YOUR MIND TO KNOW YOUR ORDER
[2:16:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat that's like saying a puzzle should solve itself for you
[2:16:09] <IamGrapes> he almost has it down
[2:16:11] <haisho> da goblins have won
[2:16:12] <PKHTjim> Let it go chat, he got it.
[2:16:13] <restingbones> Its ok, youll learn
[2:16:13] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt so the reason you attack with the guy first, is because darius has the chance to level up before he attacks, so he does more damage
[2:16:14] <Spiritttz> Well we learmed stuff so thats good
[2:16:14] <Louie_Salmon> You keep saying draw, and hand, and deck like they all mean different things, but also the same things
[2:16:19] <LordWaldemaart> the right order depends on what you want to do. its used tactically
[2:16:29] <reonome> GOBLINS
[2:16:31] <restingbones> why?
[2:16:31] <+jacintafor> mind goblins
[2:16:31] <%AnIrishPapaya> ...
[2:16:32] <%Nekros4442> There it is
[2:16:32] <%Nameloc1667> Okay, so we got Bench vs. Field down then. Do you still want help with Strike vs. Combat??
[2:16:34] <ravencloak13> If they drew n the right order then you’d have no game cause you literally would stack your deck Pat...
[2:16:34] <$TheSmerdis> why?
[2:16:35] <Zombrocom> What
[2:16:35] <twoto858> Goblins
[2:16:36] <%Nekros4442> It's ok chat
[2:16:37] <%Fooguwu> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:16:38] <%Nekros4442> DOnt ask why
[2:16:38] <+OblivionSword1> though you are absolutely right that is dumb that we can't reorder the bench by itself
[2:16:41] <+klassikFrank> IT BEGINS
[2:16:41] <Louie_Salmon> It has never been more goblin than this
[2:16:42] <$galaxyswirl> THE GOBOS
[2:16:43] <Kalcom> time to stop playing the game
[2:16:44] <crimsonsaens> There are some cases where bench order matters, but they're really rare
[2:16:44] <%Nekros4442> Do not ask why chat
[2:16:45] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> We gobbin it up boyz
[2:16:46] <+chase959> you mind goblins make us uncomfortable
[2:16:47] <%corgispudmen> your hand is where you can see cast cost
[2:16:49] <T_Sasquatch> Did you not play the basic first tutorial LUL
[2:16:50] <%MSN04_Sazabi> "Unable to understand order even though he wished for it, Pat eventually stopped thinking"
[2:16:51] <NiktenKing> @PatStaresAt It's the same as choosing your blockers...
[2:16:51] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt so the reason you attack with the guy first, is because darius has the chance to level up before he attacks, so he does more damage, understand?
[2:16:55] <$ItsRatman> It's fine guys... it's just his mind goblins at work...
[2:16:56] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt The takaway from this tutorial is attack order matters, and always put Darius the farthest left possible.
[2:16:58] <%Nobrev> why does everyone insist on calling your hand some weird shit like bench or backline?
[2:17:00] <scrublord009> @PatStaresAt Why does it make you unconfortable? Because it's not in the "right" order on the bench?
[2:17:09] <haisho> YES
[2:17:10] <+CelioHogane> YES
[2:17:10] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah

[2:17:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> Does Pat not understand basic card game mechanics?

[2:17:32] <T_Sasquatch> Weirddd messages LUL
[2:17:32] <$TheSmerdis> Thats probably the fearsome mechanic
[2:17:33] <%Leodude> The big thing is @PatStaresAt needs to look at the oracle eye, that is super useful and I think will help.
[2:17:34] <apolitenoob> Certain card effects will determine how cards can be blocked
[2:17:34] <%Nekros4442> Read keywords Pat
[2:17:36] <%strugglepunk2> read card affixs man
[2:17:36] <NiktenKing> That's fearsome
[2:17:36] <TinSilver> READ
[2:17:36] <%MajorCrasher> RTFC
[2:17:37] <Daebunz> some abilities prevent certain blocks
[2:17:38] <%SirGO0SE> sipsipGasm put it where i want it

[2:17:41] <MyNameIsRasus> READ
[2:17:43] <DrStinkers> some effects prevent blocking
[2:17:46] <+chase959> weird msgs being the rules of play
[2:17:48] <Monstanimation> Reading is hard Kappa
[2:17:50] <Cactuskris> this is like showing a shooter to woolie
[2:17:50] <Saturdaythe14th> Fearsome and elusives
[2:17:52] <+malacante> aw chat has killed pat's enthusiasm.....
[2:17:52] <%Nekros4442> There's several keywords that prevent blockers
[2:17:53] <$TheSmerdis> You really need a coach with you or something
[2:17:55] <Spiritttz> It would be nice if you could re order in Bench fore sure but its ultimatly not important for everything other than goblins
[2:17:57] <reonome> its probably against elusive/fearsome
[2:17:58] <%Ninestempest> fearsome and elusive
[2:18:00] <+jacintafor> mind goblins
[2:18:02] <%Ninestempest> absolutely
[2:18:02] <%AnIrishPapaya> That's the Fearsone stat. Fearsome prevents you from blocking with something that has less than 3 power.
[2:18:02] <ravencloak13> @nobrev Because they aren’t talking about hand. They are talking about the bench/backline which is the stone area. Your hand and backline/bench are different things
[2:18:04] <+jacintafor> are the reason
[2:18:05] <scrublord009> Always think left to right
[2:18:05] <DrStinkers> It already knows that you can't block anything else on the board
[2:18:06] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Good job Pat. Please don't get stressed from chat.
[2:18:06] <Lancaster_H> skimming over two paragraphs in 2 seconds ain't reading
[2:18:06] <nepwar> what a mysterious jogo
[2:18:08] <crimsonsaens> It was probably fearsome
[2:18:10] <$Trenr> have you considered maybe there IS a reason?
[2:18:12] <%MajorCrasher> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:18:13] <+Lazyjoules> "4 no reason "
[2:18:19] <zamzoph> oh yes
[2:18:21] <1matheuw> they are
[2:18:22] <NiktenKing> @PatStaresAt Read Shen's abilities and combo spells and you'll understand why Attack Order matters
[2:18:23] <crimsonsaens> they are
[2:18:23] <j0ustar> they are.
[2:18:24] <garbageheaphound> oh hey its Yuri Lowenthal
[2:18:25] <%Psych_man13_13> “No reason”
[2:18:26] <lvl10cybermancer> It's basically Flying from magic but only one faction gets it
[2:18:27] <$ItsRatman> Pat's the type of guy to argue with the judge why Mystical Space Typhoon doesn't negate Mirror Force.
[2:18:31] <%Nameloc1667> Abilities Fearsome and Elusive limit what can block them. That could be the reason.
[2:18:33] <+azure22900> On the line for being op all the time.
[2:18:34] <SomeAsianDood> they got nerfed they're not as bad as beta
[2:18:34] <scrublord009> Pat needs to see the Fizz OTK deck LUL
[2:18:34] <%arancet> use spells for elusive
[2:18:38] <+EndgameContent> Fighting Elusive units teaches you how to use Spells
[2:18:52] <dinnydanny777> When does Yuri Lowenthal rip his brother's arm off
[2:18:53] <crimsonsaens> Daring Poro's story is the cutest
[2:18:59] <%AnIrishPapaya> @scrublord009 LOL
[2:18:59] <+malacante> No pat's right, the game doesn't let you swap blockers in one click, you have to pull them back and then reassign
[2:19:02] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt it's probably because when a card is already blocking you need to take it off the block position so that you can block something else
[2:19:09] <%heartlesshealer> elusives can't be blocked easily, but magic still shoots them down
[2:19:09] <%Broand> So elusive is essentially MTG's "flying" hih
[2:19:16] <+chase959> I have won with this exact combo
[2:19:16] <+pectusumbra> yes
[2:19:17] <+chase959> so fun
[2:19:17] <%Ninestempest> yeah p much
[2:19:25] <crimsonsaens> yeah just attack
[2:19:25] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt So Pat. If you click and hold to put multiple attacking units out, the order you drag over them determines the attack order. First picked up is attacking first on the left.
[2:19:28] <Zombrocom> Elusive is just flying, overwhelm is just trample
[2:19:29] <%heartlesshealer> Pretty much, @Broand
[2:19:31] <1matheuw> just attack
[2:19:32] <ravencloak13> Does Pat understand MtG terms?
[2:19:33] <lvl10cybermancer> Except that instead of being the most common keyword in the game, only Ionia decks get it
[2:19:33] <iosephe> just attack
[2:19:41] <%Broand> Flyer decks are fun
[2:19:44] <T_Sasquatch> :thinking:
[2:19:46] <+azure22900> You buffed the card to be elusive so attack
[2:19:47] <scrublord009> attack order.exe not running
[2:19:51] <+jacintafor> his brain is breaking chat
[2:19:51] <reonome> it doesn't matter in this case
[2:19:51] <1matheuw> it matters not
[2:19:52] <%Nameloc1667> Either order is okay here pat.
[2:19:52] <lvl10cybermancer> And there is no reach
[2:19:53] <Louie_Salmon> Order doesn't matter here
[2:19:53] <SilentEric> In this case, it doesn't matter.
[2:19:55] <%arancet> doesnt matter here
[2:19:56] <PKHTjim> Yeah, M:TG's Flying mechanic. Only elusive can engage elusive.
[2:19:56] <+pectusumbra> for now it doesn't matter
[2:19:56] <$galaxyswirl> in this instance it doesnt matter
[2:19:59] <LoneFonte> doesn't matter
[2:20:00] <+klassikFrank> He can't do anything, just attack
[2:20:00] <SilentEric> Sometimes it does,
[2:20:00] <%crimsonharvest> can he block?
[2:20:00] <crimsonsaens> doesn't matter in this case
[2:20:01] <Daebunz> they both have elusive
[2:20:02] <%Ninestempest> @PatStaresAt attack order only matters with really specific cards
[2:20:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat doesn't understand MtG guys, stop yelling Flying and Trample at him
[2:20:04] <%heartlesshealer> It mattered because of the CARD ABILITY
[2:20:04] <Spiritttz> It only matters when it matters
[2:20:05] <%crimsonharvest> if he cant block it doesnt matter right?
[2:20:06] <%AnIrishPapaya> In this instance, it does not matter since they can't block
[2:20:06] <negaswarmlord> He can't block so it doesn't matter
[2:20:07] <+OblivionSword1> they can't block anyway so it doesn't matterr for now
[2:20:08] <%redrins> it only mattered with darius because of his evolve mechanic
[2:20:09] <%arancet> attack order mostly matters for champ conditions like darius
[2:20:10] <%Ninestempest> Like darius or shen
[2:20:11] <+marlborored5> in the case that nothing can block, it doesn't matter
[2:20:11] <NiktenKing> Elusive doesn't matter
[2:20:11] <zedravan> it mattered for darius because of his level up condition
[2:20:14] <Spiritttz> it mostly doesn matter
[2:20:14] <1matheuw> order DOES matter just not in this scenario
[2:20:14] <PKHTjim> The Overwhelm was super specific.
[2:20:17] <iosephe> Flying is intuitive and makes sense
[2:20:17] <scrublord009> In this case doesn't matter, certain champions like Sej it really matters
[2:20:23] <%Nameloc1667> For this particular attack, order wasn't important. It can be important in other situations.
[2:20:24] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Order only matters for some cards. You'll get it.
[2:20:24] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt It matters with lifelink, or with Darius, or with 'Support' cards.
[2:20:26] <Zombrocom> Pat are you ok
[2:20:27] <Louie_Salmon> Order only matters when your cards do a thing
[2:20:28] <dinnydanny777> Just play good
[2:20:29] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, whether it matters or not depends on what your cards say
[2:20:29] <crimsonsaens> we can feel it
[2:20:31] <qo_op> order only matters when it matters Kappa
[2:20:31] <%crimsonharvest> focus on the lesson
[2:20:35] <Saturdaythe14th> The whole reason you needed the card order last time is Darius' ability
[2:20:35] <j0ustar> I can feel the facepalm
[2:20:36] <iosephe> yup, it's cardgames
[2:20:37] <1matheuw> ye
[2:20:41] <reonome> it mattered last time because of darius' level up
[2:20:41] <MyNameIsRasus> Sometimes it matters, it's up to you to notice when it does
[2:20:43] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah you REALLY have to read the cards carefully.
[2:20:44] <+pectusumbra> *nod*
[2:20:44] <haisho> welcome to card games
[2:20:46] <%Buzzard42> turn on your camera
[2:20:46] <Louie_Salmon> Reading the card explains the card
[2:20:46] <lvl10cybermancer> It'll take some practice
[2:20:47] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, that's the trial and error learning
[2:20:47] <%AnIrishPapaya> Pat just needs a guide sitting next to him for him to refer to
[2:20:49] <+D00msDayDan> so what you're saying is you need to git gud
[2:20:50] <nechronia> It will usually only matter for specific cards like lifesteal or Darius
[2:20:51] <SomeAsianDood> Just read pat Kappa
[2:20:51] <crimsonsaens> barrier?
[2:20:52] <+jacintafor> many buffs go away at the end of turn
[2:20:52] <%FacetiousAF> how many fuckin tutorials are there??
[2:20:52] <$galaxyswirl> welcome to card games
[2:20:55] <%TheQButton> It's okay Pat, you're doing a good job.
[2:20:55] <%Ninestempest> @Buzzard42 if he turns on the cam he's banned
[2:20:56] <%Psych_man13_13> “Read”
[2:20:57] <%Binary_Fireball> think about the type of the card tooo
[2:20:58] <+klassikFrank> This is just LoL streams 2.0
[2:21:01] <$TheSmerdis> you might need a caoch with you, do you know anyone who plays?
[2:21:01] <ravencloak13> @anirishpapaya Yeah pretty much
[2:21:01] <scrublord009> CARD MECHANICS ARE FUCK.
[2:21:02] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah wording can get weird.
[2:21:02] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt the order matters in blocks, or in cases that champions need to level up first
[2:21:03] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> Thats basically what happened to me a lot in MTG
[2:21:04] <j0ustar> understanding the effects is essential
[2:21:09] <nepwar> you know a game thats alot more simple? Teppen
[2:21:09] <+pectusumbra> Just do your best
[2:21:10] <SilentEric> This is important to know for THRESH!
[2:21:11] <Louie_Salmon> You are notoriously bad at actually reading anything
[2:21:11] <+zepelinnn1> oh man this one
[2:21:11] <PKHTjim> The Darius scenario was more of a puzzle, needing only one way to win the turn.
[2:21:13] <T_Sasquatch> It's fine not to understand
[2:21:15] <+zepelinnn1> hope pat gets it
[2:21:15] <+klassikFrank> They don't last until they do last
[2:21:16] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt As someone who is an avid tabletop player, remembering that order of action/operation mattering is a learning experience. You'll get there man.
[2:21:17] <%Nameloc1667> It's trial and error unfortunately. Sometimes cards don't make too much sense, but you'll get there.
[2:21:19] <1matheuw> ephemeral die anyway
[2:21:21] <+OblivionSword1> some of these cards need better wording imo
[2:21:21] <+pectusumbra> SWING
[2:21:22] <%djblue_shift> get sajam in here
[2:21:23] <NiktenKing> Don't worry Pat, you're doing fine for the most part... it's just fine tuning for interactions
[2:21:23] <%djblue_shift> LOL
[2:21:25] <Spiritttz> Imagine that for over 30k cards and you know the hell that is Magic the Gathering learning curve
[2:21:32] <Winner_92> These tutorials are pretty good but card games are just hard until you get used to all the nuances
[2:21:34] <1matheuw> FACEPALM
[2:21:36] <@SoFarFetched> I mean pat will probably watch a video about Runeterra that will explain things easier and clearer for him LUL
[2:21:42] <iosephe> oh huh
[2:21:45] <anentirecrab> @PatStaresAt Runeterra is a rough TCG i feel to start with because the wording and the way they explain for keywords sucks in it compared to Magic
[2:21:46] <1matheuw> yes
[2:21:54] <ravencloak13> @sofarfetched No he won’t.
[2:21:54] <+azure22900> After combat round they die
[2:21:55] <%Nameloc1667> End of round, or when they Strike
[2:21:57] <scrublord009> Those do damage after death
[2:21:57] <TomFrank> this still the tutorial?
[2:22:01] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, they're fading away and have no time to linger
[2:22:02] <reonome> yes pat thats what ephemeral means
[2:22:05] <%Buzzard42> Ephermeral units die at end of turn, or when they deal damage
[2:22:15] <j0ustar> MTGs learning curve is something. especially with all the expansion effects. there's so much at this point....
[2:22:16] <%Ninestempest> do I just understand these cards cause i played MTG in high school like 11 years ago and still know how to read cards??
[2:22:18] <NiktenKing> No it's good tho
[2:22:20] <%heartlesshealer> like most ephemeral things such as soap bubbles
[2:22:21] <@SoFarFetched> @ravencloak13 Not with that attitude.
[2:22:23] <%Treuan> We rally
[2:22:24] <SilentEric> @Ninestempest Yes
[2:22:25] <lvl10cybermancer> You did it
[2:22:25] <%AnIrishPapaya> Ephemeral units are great because they make an opponent feel guilty for having to waste a unit on them
[2:22:30] <scrublord009> NOW WE PODRACING
[2:22:31] <%Ninestempest> @SilentEric fair enough
[2:22:32] <SilentEric> It's a card game thing
[2:22:34] <%Broand> Was that a second battle phase?
[2:22:34] <crimsonsaens> good
[2:22:36] <FALCONxPAWNCH> moon2BRAIN
[2:22:38] <Saturdaythe14th> Good jorb
[2:22:41] <1matheuw> this is tough
[2:22:44] <SilentEric> And this game shares basic functions with games like Magic
[2:22:45] <reonome> @Broand yes, he rallied
[2:22:46] <Louie_Salmon> Pat is gonna get stuck on some of these
[2:22:47] <%crimsonharvest> is this what we call learning the cadence
[2:22:48] <+CelioHogane> @Broand yes
[2:22:50] <+EndgameContent> @Broand "Rally" readies your attack immediately
[2:22:51] <NiktenKing> YEYEYE
[2:22:53] <SomeAsianDood> @Broand rally means you can swing again
[2:22:53] <Spiritttz> Ay prancster my fav card
[2:23:03] <NiktenKing> EPHEMERAL is great for baiting

[2:23:09] <+CelioHogane> @Spiritttz i hate you
[2:23:10] <scrublord009> Don't tell him. Let him to math
[2:23:13] <Spiritttz> :D
[2:23:14] <ravencloak13> @sofarfetched No I mean he actually won’t understand it more. He’ll probably be even more confused. If he actually even tries to watch a video even.
[2:23:14] <%Broand> a black card if I've ever seen one
[2:23:14] <SilentEric> Look at Prankster full art!

[2:24:02] <+klassikFrank> But you understood you screwed up. That's good

[2:24:11] <%AnIrishPapaya> Good. This is good
[2:24:13] <%Nameloc1667> It's alright, you figured out what you messed up.
[2:24:14] <$galaxyswirl> see attack order could have still won there
[2:24:15] <+klassikFrank> You getting it
[2:24:15] <%goose_attack_almanac> you got it, just had an elmoment
[2:24:16] <LoneFonte> you got it tho
[2:24:17] <+malacante> see how the prankster counted the deaths to the left of it but not the right? There's an attack order matters
[2:24:22] <SilentEric> mogwaiHeart mogwaiHeart
[2:24:26] <+EndgameContent> I think this is a good one to learn about Frontline/Backline
[2:24:27] <%heartlesshealer> reasons to not do the drag all
[2:24:28] <+CelioHogane> No
[2:24:28] <%huskarl_zap> psaBig psaHoldon psaWrong psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psa1guy psa3guy

[2:24:34] <Zombrocom> Missed 1 damage
[2:24:34] <1matheuw> doing it again
[2:24:37] <SilentEric> You missed the one damage.
[2:24:37] <+Toshatron> knowing you fucked up straight away means you get the importance of attack order
[2:24:39] <lvl10cybermancer> It's fine
[2:24:40] <+Spireman> Broken AC? Sux dude. I fix those but ur far
[2:24:41] <%Nameloc1667> Yep

[2:24:46] <TomFrank> monkaS playtime...
[2:24:47] <crimsonsaens> ????
[2:24:47] <NiktenKing> Attack order matters, see
[2:24:51] <Louie_Salmon> You could just hit A and then pull prankster back
[2:24:53] <1matheuw> you did right the last time
[2:24:53] <+EndgameContent> Oh shit, the goblins
[2:24:55] <SilentEric> Had to have her out when you killed your own unit.
[2:24:56] <Spiritttz> missed 1 damage
[2:24:57] <%heartlesshealer> pat
[2:24:59] <%Ninestempest> i mean it's more he just shouldn't have attacked lol
[2:25:00] <lvl10cybermancer> Oh wait it's not fine
[2:25:05] <NiktenKing> If she lived until the others died, then you would have won
[2:25:06] <+Lazyjoules> oh whoops
[2:25:08] <%spitelite> he needs to be out too
[2:25:08] <T_Sasquatch> Looooool
[2:25:09] <%arancet> play her THEN kill spider weenie
[2:25:09] <ScatterCatt> Prankster has to be out when you sacrifice the one unit.
[2:25:09] <%heartlesshealer> read more please
[2:25:09] <MyNameIsRasus> You needed to play Prankster before butcher
[2:25:10] <SilentEric> You needed her out BEFORE you played pig man

[2:25:11] <%MSN04_Sazabi> MISSED 1 DAMAGE FROM THE FIRST CARD

[2:25:14] <%heartlesshealer> no
[2:25:15] <1matheuw> nop
[2:25:16] <+skylerpilot> you need prankster down before you play the 0 cost
[2:25:16] <Louie_Salmon> No
[2:25:17] <crimsonsaens> Play Prankster before Butcher
[2:25:17] <lvl10cybermancer> Slightly different
[2:25:17] <%Ninestempest> oh nope
[2:25:18] <%crimsonharvest> what does prankster do when shit dies?
[2:25:19] <%linSP> psaCrazyhand
[2:25:19] <$galaxyswirl> REMEMBER ATTACK ORDER
[2:25:19] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt You killed your dude before you played prankster
[2:25:20] <scrublord009> missed hapless damage
[2:25:20] <%Ninestempest> you need to summon it first
[2:25:21] <+chase959> I love watching boomer Pat on the card games
[2:25:21] <%DocChutney> prankster out first
[2:25:22] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you killed the guy before putting prankster

[2:25:23] <DrStinkers> play prankser first
[2:25:25] <1matheuw> prankster before butcher
[2:25:25] <%Buzzard42> card order

[2:25:45] <SilentEric> There is that one damage
[2:25:46] <reonome> you do it
[2:25:47] <$galaxyswirl> well that works too
[2:25:50] <%Nameloc1667> There you go
[2:25:53] <+EndgameContent> WE CARD GAMES NOW LADS
[2:25:53] <1matheuw> yay now you win
[2:25:54] <Spiritttz> there we go
[2:25:55] <%Broand> This is a typical black play in MTG
[2:25:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Good job!
[2:25:56] <PKHTjim> Got it.
[2:25:58] <Saturdaythe14th> I failed this tutorial once by playing the pig first too, I felt real dumb
[2:26:03] <Louie_Salmon> You should try hitting A, it will make your life so much easier
[2:26:06] <NiktenKing> Some units wanna be on bench or at the very least attack in a later part of attack order
[2:26:08] <lvl10cybermancer> I gotta say though I do wish that the animations in this game were faster
[2:26:09] <SilentEric> SHADOW ISLES!
[2:26:09] <Spiritttz> BEST CARD
[2:26:10] <%Ninestempest> shadow isles is just mtg black tbh lol
[2:26:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Imagine three of them at once
[2:26:14] <%heartlesshealer> good job
[2:26:15] <%Ninestempest> so much graveyard play
[2:26:16] <%kewlmyc> Is this AI or is he fighting someone?
[2:26:18] <solidus_twitch> imagine this card but its also healing your nexus :)
[2:26:18] <%Nameloc1667> @Louie_Salmon He didn't want to attack with all of them though
[2:26:19] <dinnydanny777> Try winning
[2:26:20] <Spiritttz> PLAY WITH THRESH
[2:26:20] <%heartlesshealer> A is the lose button
[2:26:21] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah then you can just change it
[2:26:22] <+CelioHogane> @kewlmyc tutorial
[2:26:23] <%AnIrishPapaya> Yeah, A sucks
[2:26:24] <lvl10cybermancer> Doing it manually is fine
[2:26:24] <+KeslGames> Playing tutorials
[2:26:25] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> I had a MTG deck like this. It was fun
[2:26:25] <Spiritttz> big PP
[2:26:25] <+jacintafor> you can change the order
[2:26:26] <%Jack8274> What just happened?
[2:26:27] <SilentEric> You can hit A then pull back anything you don't want to attack with.
[2:26:29] <+Quack_of_Dawn> There's a 5-cost similar one that drains one instead of just dealing damage
[2:26:30] <%huskarl_zap> psaBig psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand_HF psaWrong
[2:26:30] <scrublord009> never hit A
[2:26:32] <%walternatorz> everyone is always mad
[2:26:35] <%Buzzard42> @PatStaresAt yeah if I see someone play her I will go WELL out of my way to get rid of her AAP
[2:26:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> I lost to someone earlier today because they had three of those Pranksters active at once so I just kept taking damage.
[2:26:38] <+skylerpilot> @PatStaresAt there is another one that is a 5 cost that does the same thing except it heals you for 1 at the same time
[2:26:40] <crimsonsaens> It doesn't matter where the Prankster is on the bench, just drag them at will
[2:26:50] <crimsonsaens> You can change battle order
[2:26:52] <VritraReiRei> @kewlmyc this are tutorial challenge missions
[2:26:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Welcome to streaming card games.
[2:26:55] <SilentEric> You can change the order by pulling off and putting back on to the grass land.
[2:26:56] <Zombrocom> Oh hey, it's freeze from HS
[2:27:00] <%Binary_Fireball> slow it down and relax allow your brain to think
[2:27:00] <lvl10cybermancer> Forget A, just doing it manually is fine
[2:27:04] <$TheSmerdis> You cant change the order ONCE you hit attack, but until you declare you can do whatever you lik
[2:27:08] <%AncelDeLambert> psa3guy psa3guy
[2:27:09] <Louie_Salmon> But A is faster
[2:27:10] <NiktenKing> Yes, one of the most annoying in the game if you don't have removal
[2:27:11] <%Broand> Frostbite is what, attack =0?
[2:27:13] <%Ninestempest> it's freeze from hs but not purely for shitty annoying control decks
[2:27:14] <%linSP> psaBig
[2:27:18] <%Nameloc1667> If you hit A and put everything on the field, you can rearrange on the field until you pass your turn to the enemy.
[2:27:18] <Cactuskris> true game he is
[2:27:19] <Louie_Salmon> Faster is more betterer
[2:27:25] <DrStinkers> @PatStaresAt did you know about the eyeball on the left that shows the future
[2:27:28] <%AnIrishPapaya> The sad part is, these questions would be solved in half a second if someone was there to show him
[2:27:35] <DougintheTrench> @PatStaresAt Pat you can change the order only when one guy says so expect when you can't.
[2:27:37] <%AnIrishPapaya> Or control his mouse
[2:27:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Win in 1
[2:27:39] <%Buzzard42> ♫ too many cooks ♫
[2:27:46] <%Ninestempest> pat just needs a pro on discord to teach him
[2:27:49] <SilentEric> Freeze freeze breath.
[2:27:51] <crimsonsaens> no
[2:27:52] <+KeslGames> PUT THAT BACK
[2:27:52] <+CelioHogane> noooo
[2:27:52] <+azure22900> slow spell
[2:27:59] <%Binary_Fireball> too late
[2:28:00] <iosephe> no overwhelm
[2:28:02] <+jacintafor> you have to win in one round
[2:28:03] <%huskarl_zap> too many cocks Kreygasm
[2:28:09] <Saturdaythe14th> At least Pat is doing better than Day9, who spent like 7 minutes complaining about the blood dudes not being vampires or something
[2:28:12] <SilentEric> Didn't win this turn.
[2:28:13] <%rytyoung> Oh I see we still have Elmo hiding Pat's exposed orbs
[2:28:15] <scrublord009> let him fail he will get it
[2:28:16] <%huskarl_zap> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand_HF psaWrong
[2:28:17] <nepwar> combo to kill all
[2:28:18] <SilentEric> Get rid of his blockers
[2:28:20] <T_Sasquatch> Too many cucks 👀
[2:28:21] <%Buzzard42> he'll figure it out
[2:28:23] <+skylerpilot> read the cards pat
[2:28:24] <%Ninestempest> RTFC
[2:28:24] <MyNameIsRasus> You need to destroy the nexus in 1 turn
[2:28:26] <+Shacklebox> READ YOUR CARDS
[2:28:27] <+blurblewurble> chat just let him learn
[2:28:29] <$TheSmerdis> you really need to read the messages
[2:28:30] <+KeslGames> Don't attack first
[2:28:30] <1matheuw> PLAY
[2:28:31] <%Binary_Fireball> because they werent on the field
[2:28:31] <jkfd> @Saturdaythe14th but is he really though
[2:28:32] <Louie_Salmon> On play
[2:28:33] <%Buzzard42> let him figure it out
[2:28:33] <%Ninestempest> WHEN YOU PLAY
[2:28:33] <SilentEric> He was already played.
[2:28:33] <iosephe> It's already played
[2:28:34] <%AnIrishPapaya> Maybe if we say nothing this will go faster
[2:28:34] <+jacintafor> from the hand
[2:28:34] <PKHTjim> He was already in play.
[2:28:34] <+CelioHogane> IT'S ALREADY PLAYED
[2:28:36] <twoto858> Play = pulling the card out of the hand
[2:28:36] <%arancet> that means when first summoned
[2:28:36] <+KeslGames> PLAY IS FROM HAND
[2:28:37] <SataruYamate> Play not Attack
[2:28:37] <%Nameloc1667> Because he's already played.
[2:28:38] <Kalcom> read it again
[2:28:38] <%Broand> from your haaaaand
[2:28:38] <MyNameIsRasus> It's when you summon him
[2:28:39] <+skylerpilot> on play, not on attack
[2:28:40] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> read play
[2:28:40] <Snirtax> READ THE DEFINITION
[2:28:41] <%Ninestempest> that's ATTACK
[2:28:41] <1matheuw> no its not
[2:28:41] <+CelioHogane> NO
[2:28:41] <Saturdaythe14th> In a different way maybe
[2:28:42] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt play is when you put it in the field
[2:28:42] <%goose_attack_almanac> Play from your hand
[2:28:42] <DrStinkers> play means play from hanbd
[2:28:43] <%baronblank> you didn't play him, he's already played
[2:28:43] <SilentEric> When played from hand. Not when attacking.
[2:28:43] <+CelioHogane> THAT'S ATTACK
[2:28:43] <+OblivionSword1> play is summon from hand

[2:29:06] <apolitenoob> Stone part is bench, hand is down at the bottom of the screen, field is grass
[2:29:06] <%BestTeaMaker> in the very first tutorial
[2:29:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> Playing from hand means summoning it
[2:29:07] <+Shacklebox> read it
[2:29:07] <SilentEric> The first tutorial with Garen did.
[2:29:08] <Spiritttz> Yes
[2:29:08] <%Broand> Hand -> bench ->field
[2:29:09] <Cactuskris> it did
[2:29:09] <%Ninestempest> THE GAME DID THAT
[2:29:10] <IamGrapes> the stone area is the backline
[2:29:11] <crimsonsaens> It did
[2:29:12] <$Trenr> He's already played
[2:29:14] <LordWaldemaart> It did in the first
[2:29:14] <bearking05> it did
[2:29:14] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt it help if youve played any card game ever.
[2:29:15] <+EndgameContent> Hand below Bench below Field
[2:29:15] <+Quack_of_Dawn> iS IT NOT OBVIOUS WHAT YOUR HAND IS?
[2:29:15] <sendart> hello paige
[2:29:15] <SataruYamate> @PatStaresAt the stone area is what this game calls your "backline"
[2:29:16] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> it dkd in the first one
[2:29:17] <%Agami23> it needs a SUPER tutorial. for people who have never played a real card game
[2:29:18] <$KaosMachina> REAL LEAGUESTONE HOURS
[2:29:19] <%Ninestempest> they literally say that in the first one
[2:29:19] <+OblivionSword1> the hand is what your holding
[2:29:19] <BlacSoul> YOU TOLD PAIGE EARLIER WHERE HAND WAS
[2:29:19] <+CelioHogane> YES
[2:29:20] <Snirtax> Your hand is literally always the same thing in all cardgames pat
[2:29:20] <Kalcom> first tutorial said it
[2:29:20] <1matheuw> they did tho
[2:29:21] <VritraReiRei> Crazy Talk LUL
[2:29:22] <%crimsonharvest> have you ever held cards pat
[2:29:22] <$Trenr> your hand is on the bottom, for the things you haven't playd
[2:29:22] <nepwar> what you need is a handy manual found inside the game box
[2:29:23] <%kp539000> Hand - Bench - Field
[2:29:23] <SGrim> IT WAS IN THE FIRST TUTORIAL
[2:29:24] <Louie_Salmon> The hand is the cards you can play, like literally every other card game ever
[2:29:28] <SilentEric> People are making up terms in here.
[2:29:28] <$ItsRatman> That's like... the first tutorial?
[2:29:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Then why are y'all saying different terms
[2:29:31] <Snirtax> Your hand will always be the cards you're holding
[2:29:32] <+MillerLowlife> rear zone also
[2:29:32] <Zombrocom> It's really not that complicated
[2:29:33] <+OblivionSword1> the bench analogy is just for you
[2:29:33] <%silverira> they did told you
[2:29:34] <BlacSoul> ahh
[2:29:36] <%FacetiousAF> sounds a lot like "fuck this game"
[2:29:38] <haisho> welcome to internets
[2:29:40] <%Buzzard42> psaBig backseating
[2:29:43] <NiktenKing> He's on bench already
[2:29:45] <+the_krypto_knight> Bench is more common in other card games, but I don't think the game uses it
[2:29:45] <Spiritttz> The overlap with other card games is strong with runterra
[2:29:45] <+R_BChe> its like saying dp instead of shoryu
[2:29:46] <$TheSmerdis> The game does call it the backline on a couple of cards
[2:29:48] <+Calern> looks like this are going great 2 hours in
[2:29:49] <%redrins> pat psaBig stumbo
[2:29:50] <@SoFarFetched> Do Burpies
[2:29:53] <%TheWinged7> sipsipBaby
[2:29:53] <+MoonObscure> lol
[2:29:53] <+KevinsLunchbox> chat is too stupid to stop using MtG terms
[2:29:54] <+HelloImTom08> Paige help him
[2:29:54] <@commanderclaw> Paige, you're the last person who could help
[2:29:56] <Saturdaythe14th> The bench doesn't really have an official term so people keep saying different things
[2:29:56] <PKHTjim> There ya go.
[2:29:57] <%crimsonharvest> big bully
[2:30:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> You're doing fine Pat, there's just so many different card games everyone uses different terms.
[2:30:03] <%arancet> paiges butt popped
[2:30:03] <%Buzzard42> THERE we go
[2:30:04] <JetpackMcQuack> too many one guys
[2:30:05] <garbageheaphound> Get that Fetish shit outta here
[2:30:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> GRASS = Feild ..... STONE ZONE = Bench I think
[2:30:09] <solidus_twitch> did paige come and solve the challenge?
[2:30:10] <ShichiNoBushi> Your Bot.
[2:30:13] <%TheWinged7> the big baby man needs a change?
[2:30:14] <T_Sasquatch> Pat could use some burpies Kappa
[2:30:17] <%Nameloc1667> People make their own words or carry terms from other games unfortunately.
[2:30:22] <$Trenr> and some pokemon
[2:30:22] <iosephe> Yep!
[2:30:22] <Daxalog> And Pokemon terms
[2:30:22] <SomeAsianDood> What league terms?
[2:30:23] <Kalcom> yugioh
[2:30:24] <+KeslGames> Pokemon actually
[2:30:26] <%ChaosAethr> Is This Hearthstone?
[2:30:26] <DrStinkers> yugioh also
[2:30:28] <SilentEric> Yeah. Carrying over terms from other games.
[2:30:29] <+jacintafor> top is fed
[2:30:29] <%huskarl_zap> psaBlep_SG psaCrazyhand_HF psaWrong
[2:30:30] <$Trenr> bench is definitely pokemon
[2:30:30] <PKHTjim> Pokemon terms for Bench, hah
[2:30:31] <%Ninestempest> "play" is not a unique term
[2:30:31] <Zombrocom> I mean, the hand is the same thing in every game
[2:30:31] <scrublord009> yu gi oh Kappa
[2:30:33] <%Chimeraelite> LUL
[2:30:33] <haisho> especially pokemon
[2:30:34] <+KeslGames> Bench is a Pokemon thing
[2:30:35] <$ItsRatman> Bench is from Pokemon
[2:30:36] <nepwar> gg no re. jg diff
[2:30:37] <NiktenKing> Why are people using backline?
[2:30:37] <+Nyanergy> and duel masters
[2:30:39] <+HelloImTom08> LUL
[2:30:39] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> Use tackle
[2:30:40] <ravencloak13> How does he not understand what the hand is? Why does him drawing the cards from his deck and going into his hand make him think the bench is his hand?
[2:30:41] <%Agami23> yeah bench is a pokemon thing
[2:30:42] <+itsOnyxLeo> Bench is Pokémon, yeah
[2:30:43] <SataruYamate> Bench sounds like Pokemon
[2:30:43] <+neutralraff> all TCGs use this man.
[2:30:43] <ShichiNoBushi> I remember before Magic used terms like "Battlefield" or "Exile".
[2:30:43] <MyNameIsRasus> BETTER TOP WINS
[2:30:45] <%Buzzard42> psaBig backseating from chat
[2:30:45] <1matheuw> add in some yugioh and bakugan for the hell of it
[2:30:46] <DrStinkers> this is bascially pokemon with leage characters
[2:30:50] <DougintheTrench> @PatStaresAt PAT YOU NEED TO PUT THE YOUR SUMMON IS DEFENSE MODE
[2:30:51] <TheFakeBob> Teemo?
[2:30:52] <Spiritttz> In magic the bench and feild are the same thing too
[2:30:53] <%Broand> I don't understand why pat doesn't understand the function of the bootyhole zone
[2:30:53] <BlacSoul> just play pot of greed
[2:30:55] <crimsonsaens> Bench is not referred to in the tutorial, but it does point out which is the hand
[2:30:58] <Kalcom> but what about teemo
[2:30:59] <CherrieVelvet> but teemo
[2:31:00] <Winner_92> Guys pat doesn’t play TCGs of course he doesn’t know this shit
[2:31:00] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Pat I believe in you.
[2:31:01] <Daxalog> How do you select what rewards you get? I cant do that
[2:31:02] <%huskarl_zap> psaBig psa3guy
[2:31:04] <%Ninestempest> this game is much more similar to MTG where as the "field" here is just where you "declare attackers"
[2:31:04] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> if you want teemo do piltover
[2:31:05] <SilentEric> mogwaiHeart mogwaiHeart mogwaiHeart
[2:31:05] <nepwar> report yi for funneling
[2:31:06] <%BubbaRands> Play PIKACHU!
[2:31:06] <MyNameIsRasus> @BlacSoul but what does it do?
[2:31:07] <%Aztec50> is this actually how pokemon plays?
[2:31:11] <+Quack_of_Dawn> The middle is JUST the declare attackers phase
[2:31:12] <%TheWinged7> I dont understand pat, all you have to do is floop the pig Kappa
[2:31:15] <$ItsRatman> Wait until Pat hears about the Graveyard and the Super Graveyard
[2:31:18] <+the_krypto_knight> nah this is a lot more like hearthstone than pokemon
[2:31:18] <scrublord009> now to the new mechanics
[2:31:28] <Saturdaythe14th> You know honestly you might be better off just staring at tutorials for ages and not confusing yourself
[2:31:34] <iosephe> Play refers to cards that enter the battlefield, not cards that attack
[2:31:34] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Here are the official terms: Hand: the card you have drawn but not yet played. Back row: The cards you have played but are not battling. Battling: The cards that are currently attacking or blocking.
[2:31:37] <%Ninestempest> this game is halfway between HS and MTG
[2:31:38] <ravencloak13> @itsratman Is the super graveyard like banish?
[2:31:38] <%Agami23> ok pat, so for this one you'll need to play a pokemon from your bench and mega evolve it to attack your opponents blue tidewalker
[2:31:40] <%riantDeliration> Super Graveyard? Does this game have Exile?
[2:31:53] <+EndgameContent> This card is cool
[2:31:56] <Saturdaythe14th> Oh these are new cards
[2:32:00] <%BubbaRands> A tune Kappa
[2:32:01] <BlacSoul> @MyNameIsRasus It allows him to draw 2 cards, and then play pot of greed,
[2:32:07] <+EndgameContent> He's a spell when he's in your hand
[2:32:16] <Spiritttz> noo
[2:32:18] <SilentEric> So you had to let the spell resolve first.
[2:32:21] <%Ninestempest> nothing yet
[2:32:23] <$TheSmerdis> close, but you attacked too early
[2:32:23] <BlacSoul> rip
[2:32:24] <Zombrocom> Nothing happened
[2:32:25] <Snirtax> You failed btw
[2:32:26] <scrublord009> dont worry he will get it
[2:32:27] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> Blue eyes white bulbasaur is a good card
[2:32:27] <+jacintafor> if you cast and attack enemies can react
[2:32:32] <nepwar> LUL
[2:32:32] <%Nameloc1667> Don't attack yet
[2:32:32] <%Ninestempest> do it first so they can't block
[2:32:34] <Kalcom> slow spell
[2:32:35] <Ipsenscastle> Despite being really similar, this is way less watchable than Hearthstone. I can't put my finger on why
[2:32:37] <+malacante> this is kind of a subtle point, that fast spells don't resolve until all combat does
[2:32:38] <Louie_Salmon> You shouldn't have attacked
[2:32:43] <Spiritttz> stun before declare attack
[2:32:43] <Kalcom> slow sucks
[2:32:44] <SilentEric> Let the spell resolve before attacking
[2:32:44] <%Ninestempest> NO
[2:32:44] <SataruYamate> the tip if you fail is always set lol, so in that case its unhelpful LUL
[2:32:44] <MyNameIsRasus> @BlacSoul BUT THEN
[2:32:45] <1matheuw> NO
[2:32:46] <%Ninestempest> ><
[2:32:48] <%arancet> dont attack yet
[2:32:49] <DrStinkers> That only works if they ahve overwhelm
[2:32:51] <twoto858> Don't attack yet
[2:32:51] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Here are the official terms: Hand: the card you have drawn but not yet played. Back row: The cards you have played but are not battling. Battling: The cards that are currently attacking or blocking.
[2:32:51] <%corgispudmen> no
[2:32:52] <%BubbaRands> No Pat You missed the timing!
[2:32:52] <$TheSmerdis> Its nothing like hearthstone, way more comparable to Magic or Artifact
[2:32:53] <%huskarl_zap> BabyRage psaCrazyhand psaBlep_SG psaCrazyhand_HF psaBig psaHoldon psaWrong Kreygasm
[2:32:53] <%Nameloc1667> Don't attack yet. Let the stun happen first
[2:32:53] <crimsonsaens> Let the spell resolve first
[2:32:54] <%aishman> You need to STUN first
[2:32:58] <+KeslGames> RESOLVE YOUR SPELL FIRST
[2:32:58] <%aishman> Don't attack
[2:32:59] <SilentEric> Let the spell resolve before attacking Pat
[2:32:59] <bearking05> pat please
[2:33:00] <Kalcom> SLOW
[2:33:00] <+HelloImTom08> Try Again
[2:33:00] <ravencloak13> @ipsenscastle It’s the exact same though. Just different characters.
[2:33:01] <%Ninestempest> do not attack until you stun
[2:33:03] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> stun pass then atack
[2:33:04] <1matheuw> let the spell play out first before attacking
[2:33:05] <Louie_Salmon> You have to win in one turn
[2:33:05] <+driemen> there is no feedback in this game lmao
[2:33:05] <%arancet> dont attack uintil spell go
[2:33:08] <LordWaldemaart> Why are doing the same exact thing pat?
[2:33:08] <+HelloImTom08> LUL
[2:33:09] <Cactuskris> back and to the left
[2:33:10] <+marlborored5> stun before the attack so that the enemy doesn't have a chance to block @PatStaresAt
[2:33:11] <%AnIrishPapaya> Yay
[2:33:12] <NiktenKing> Resolve spell so you can have two units to attack
[2:33:13] <Snirtax> How do you do something, and it doesn't work, and your first reaction is to do it again? The enemy has five health, you need the other unit to win in one turn
[2:33:14] <SilentEric> Now he can't block
[2:33:15] <%Nameloc1667> Now he can't block
[2:33:16] <twoto858> Now attack
[2:33:16] <Louie_Salmon> You only have 2 attack, so you can't possibly win by attacking
[2:33:19] <+jacintafor> you can attack with both now
[2:33:20] <$TheSmerdis> Its not a burst spell, so it doesnt happen until the start of the next turn
[2:33:20] <%Ninestempest> @PatStaresAt they blocked you before, now they can't
[2:33:21] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt now hes stunned and cant block
[2:33:21] <+driemen> Pat could keep doing this for hours and he has no feedback
[2:33:22] <$Trenr> the difference is a whole extra person to attack with
[2:33:22] <Spiritttz> now he cant block
[2:33:22] <1matheuw> now you have 2 units instead of one
[2:33:23] <+MillerLowlife> just do math
[2:33:23] <TheFakeBob> you get a 3/2 and they can't attack
[2:33:24] <+Shacklebox> now he's stuck in the bench
[2:33:25] <$TheSmerdis> YOU NEED A COACH MAN
[2:33:26] <Winner_92> The phantom blocker thing is super unclear
[2:33:26] <NiktenKing> Now you have TWO units
[2:33:26] <%Agami23> do you remember your pemdas?
[2:33:28] <+Quack_of_Dawn> The difference is that they declare blockers before the spell resolves
[2:33:29] <+EndgameContent> You haven't used your attack yet
[2:33:29] <sendart> awetillery
[2:33:30] <Louie_Salmon> Because you only get one combat
[2:33:31] <@commanderclaw> Card games are nothing *but* order of operations
[2:33:31] <+driemen> driemen subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[2:33:31] <solidus_twitch> removing a defender during the attacking phase leaves a "ghost blocker" that stops you from dealing damage unless you have overwhelm
[2:33:32] <%BubbaRands> TIMING PAT
[2:33:33] <nepwar> PEMDAS
[2:33:33] <negaswarmlord> Because once you declare attack you commit
[2:33:34] <TheFakeBob> once you declare attack, you're locked in
[2:33:35] <preppyposs> you committed your attackers pat
[2:33:35] <$Trenr> because you already declared attackers
[2:33:36] <crimsonsaens> Fast spells don't resolve until you pass intiative
[2:33:36] <bearking05> things need to happen
[2:33:37] <+jacintafor> you can only declare attacking once
[2:33:38] <%BestTeaMaker> cause he was already blocking before, which is why that failed
[2:33:39] <DrStinkers> @PatStaresAt blocked attackers stay blocked, except with overwhelm
[2:33:40] <+the_krypto_knight> The order you do things is basically critically important to all card games
[2:33:40] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you stunned him, so he didn't have a chance to block
[2:33:41] <apolitenoob> The spell has to resolve for you to summon the creature, otherwise it's not on your bench for the attack
[2:33:41] <1matheuw> because you cant do that in the game
[2:33:42] <Zombrocom> Oh boy
[2:33:42] <+Shacklebox> i can see why you hate these games pat, you suck ass at them
[2:33:42] <iosephe> Gotta get a combo opener before you use your finisher
[2:33:42] <SilentEric> Burst spells happen instantly. Other spells have to resolve. @PatStaresAt
[2:33:43] <+JonathLP> pemdas
[2:33:43] <%corgispudmen> you cant attack twice
[2:33:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Because you only get one combat.
[2:33:44] <+EndgameContent> You were attacking when you cast the spell
[2:33:46] <+Toshatron> because you declared attackers without declaring the second guy
[2:33:47] <%Nameloc1667> Because you can only declare attackers once.
[2:33:51] <+HelloImTom08> I think this is why i quit this game, i hated all the timeing shit like this
[2:33:52] <SataruYamate> im sweatin lol
[2:33:52] <LordWaldemaart> You declared attack before he was summoned
[2:33:52] <NiktenKing> Cause declaring attack uses your attack token
[2:33:54] <reonome> because you already commited to attacking
[2:33:55] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt You stopped him from blocking
[2:33:55] <Saturdaythe14th> Because if you cast a spell and then pass like that, your opponent gets a chance to play a card
[2:33:55] <SGrim> Because you have to play the game according to it's rule, not your wants.
[2:33:56] <PKHTjim> By stunning the guy before attacking, they couldn't block you.
[2:33:57] <Snirtax> Once you declare attackers you cannot add subsequent ones even if they are summoned to your bench
[2:33:59] <$TheSmerdis> Because the spell doesnt trigger until you already declare the attackers, once declared you cant add more
[2:34:05] <SGrim> rules*
[2:34:19] <%WhereIsWill> because you haven't built exodia yet Kappa
[2:34:21] <+jeppflepp_dunderkrepp> @PatStaresAt because that was a keyword: Fast spell, the enemy gets to react to it. same thing with slow spells but not with burst spells
[2:34:21] <%huskarl_zap> LuvBrownL psaCrazyhand_HF psaWrong
[2:34:22] <%driemen> God I love hearthstone
[2:34:25] <Saturdaythe14th> The game is a lot slower than it looks, the AI is just passing constantly so it looks more confusing
[2:34:25] <%silverira> I can tell you really can't enjoy cardgames
[2:34:25] <%MajorCrasher> MajorCrasher subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:34:28] <Cactuskris> missed timing is why I stopped playing yugioh locally don´t worry
[2:34:31] <ravencloak13> Gods, he’s not even using a full deck yet... this is only going to get more fucked.
[2:34:34] <SilentEric> Now you can put out the big guy.
[2:34:38] <nepwar> woww~
[2:34:41] <$TheSmerdis> Again, people comparing this to hearthstone are VERY wrong
[2:34:43] <SilentEric> And challenger
[2:34:53] <NiktenKing> Challenge
[2:34:55] <SilentEric> That's Lee Sin babee!
[2:34:55] <Louie_Salmon> Read the cards!
[2:34:56] <reonome> then play it again
[2:34:56] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[2:34:57] <%Ninestempest> challenger
[2:34:57] <+OblivionSword1> it's fine
[2:34:57] <%huskarl_zap> psaWrong
[2:34:58] <crimsonsaens> You did it right
[2:34:59] <PKHTjim> This is more like Magic.
[2:35:00] <%BestTeaMaker> play it again
[2:35:01] <nepwar> congratualtion u are winner
[2:35:02] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Challenger lets you choose what blocks them
[2:35:02] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt you got more mana to make the play
[2:35:02] <Skatedeandre> Bee sin
[2:35:03] <$TheSmerdis> Lee Sin gets buffs when you p[lay spells
[2:35:03] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt challenger let's you select the blocker for that attacker.
[2:35:04] <DrStinkers> skipped the challenger tutorial
[2:35:04] <+Lazyjoules> run it back rhen
[2:35:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> that's Ionia cards for ya.
[2:35:05] <iosephe> RTFC
[2:35:05] <twoto858> Do it again
[2:35:06] <%driemen> This game is giving him no feedback
[2:35:06] <%DocChutney> lee sin gains challenge and barrier when you use spells
[2:35:07] <Spiritttz> that deck needs some seriosue skill to pilot
[2:35:07] <scrublord009> YOU DID THE RIGHT ORDER OF ACTIONS
[2:35:07] <JetpackMcQuack> The heart of the cards chose you
[2:35:08] <%crimsonharvest> how about you walk us through it pat
[2:35:09] <T_Sasquatch> I've had that feeling LUL
[2:35:10] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Only burst Spells resolve the instant they are played. Other spells and "play" abilities only resolve once you and the opponent don't do anything in response.
[2:35:10] <NiktenKing> You challenged so that he wouldn't block your 4/2
[2:35:10] <TheWashoutXY> That happens when you don't read the cards...
[2:35:11] <%Broand> Why do the cards refer to themselves in first person
[2:35:11] <+EndgameContent> You cheated an expensive card into play
[2:35:11] <%WhereIsWill> run it back till ya do
[2:35:11] <%driemen> This is so bad as a tutorial
[2:35:13] <DougintheTrench> You believed in the heart of the cards Pat.
[2:35:14] <+MillerLowlife> place a Battle Prism into the Downward Courtyard
[2:35:18] <%silverira> READ THE FUCKING CARDS @PatStaresAt
[2:35:20] <LoneFonte> read the card then
[2:35:22] <Snirtax> You played two spells to trigger Lee Sin's abilities, which then allowed you to challenge the enemy minion where you wanted it to hit your enemy for 4.
[2:35:24] <%realm_forge> This game is 8 kinds of in your face
[2:35:31] <+blurblewurble> try explaining each card step by step to us and see if it helpw
[2:35:31] <PzKpfw_VI_Tiger_Ausf_E> You digivolved your leesinmon
[2:35:32] <JetpackMcQuack> BlessRNG Jesus take the wheel
[2:35:33] <SGrim> Rules hard.
[2:35:33] <+EndgameContent> @Broand Easier to understand context and requires less text
[2:35:38] <PKHTjim> Play a deck you're comfy playing with.
[2:35:39] <%driemen> If a game lets you win and you don't know why it's not doing a good job as a tutorial at all
[2:35:41] <Louie_Salmon> If you read the cards it's an excellent tutorial
[2:35:50] <apolitenoob> Challenger allows you to choose who blocks the character with challenger. Because Lee Sin gains barrier and you can choose to have him blocked, it freed up the other lane for damage.
[2:35:50] <+pectusumbra> In the grim darkness of the 42nd millenium, there is only the SPLEEN of the cards
[2:35:57] <ravencloak13> Look, let’s just give Pat the most simplest cancer deck IE Elise with her zerg rush spiders.
[2:35:57] <$TheSmerdis> You should read Lee Sin this time around
[2:35:59] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt You used spells to cheat out a unit you could not afford, while giving Lee Sin challenger. Lee Sin then allowed the unit to hit nexus for 4 damage, which you needed.
[2:36:02] <+HelloImTom08> just read 4Head
[2:36:02] <iosephe> Yeah
[2:36:03] <+malacante> oh my god please do not call them lanes
[2:36:04] <+preppyposs> pat when you commit attackers it allows someone to block you
[2:36:15] <SilentEric> Yep
[2:36:18] <%Nameloc1667> Specifically a Spell magic though, not a magic for anything.
[2:36:19] <PKHTjim> Yup!
[2:36:23] <NiktenKing> Yes
[2:36:23] <Kalcom> slow spells suck
[2:36:23] <+Quack_of_Dawn> That how works
[2:36:24] <Louie_Salmon> No, not play both, ATTACK with both
[2:36:28] <NiktenKing> Got it down
[2:36:30] <%silverira> you can't just skim over the cards @PatStaresAt

[2:37:47] <ravencloak13> Now do it one more time
[2:37:47] <%Nameloc1667> Important thing to keep in mind is that Attune gives you Spell mana, not mana that you can spend on anything.
[2:37:50] <%silverira> THE MORE YOU KNOW
[2:38:05] <SilentEric> Pssst. Hey Peach
[2:38:08] <Louie_Salmon> I've noticed that Pat is literally incapable of not skimming something like 5 times before actually reading it once, but insisting each of those 5 times that he did in fact read it

[2:38:54] <%Nameloc1667> @Louie_Salmon It's just part of what he does. Especially on camera he wants to be entertaining and not drag down the mood, so he feels pressure to go quick, and winds up missing stuff.

[2:44:09] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt if you go to collection, you can import a deep deck there
[2:44:13] <SGrim> Just make sure you are solid on all orders of operation.
[2:44:16] <%riantDeliration> Kinda blue-green I guess
[2:44:17] <%realm_forge> The deepest dankest deck
[2:44:18] <NiktenKing> Deep an Poro decks are BIG NUMBER decks

[2:44:19] <zamzoph> netdecking awwwwright
[2:44:20] <%SashaStarshine> @Zombrocom When you have 15 cards or less in your deck you become deep
[2:44:21] <Louie_Salmon> Kind like a graveyard mill deck, but way less complicated
[2:44:23] <+blurblewurble> deep decks are expensive as fuck tho
[2:44:32] <Zombrocom> Ah ok self mill got it.
[2:44:35] <restingbones> ??
[2:44:38] <+pectusumbra> @shockmaster3 I think so yeah

[2:44:47] <%코코꾸라> @PatStaresAt Spritz
[2:44:51] <%Jekado> is it self mill like a drege deck?
[2:44:51] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt I put it on Twitch Whispers
[2:44:52] <%CalderGaming> CalderGaming subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Hail, Ginger. I know it hasn't come up for a while but did you ever plan to get back into Gundam? It seems like a rich vein for discussion.
[2:44:53] <%Mendin> @shockmaster3 Not yet but his voicelines are in the game so presumably next patch
[2:44:53] <Saturdaythe14th> Deep decks tend to run Maokai though, who mills the opponent, so it's self mill and real mill
[2:44:54] <%TalisKanju> Can we have elmocam forever?
[2:44:57] <zamzoph> just type it 4Head
[2:44:59] <%BubbaRands> Send deck plz
[2:45:01] <Zombrocom> It's like a self mill ramp deck neat
[2:45:07] <+blurblewurble> deep is when you have less than 15 cards in deck a bunch of your cards level up and do extra damage
[2:45:14] <SilentEric> Phew

[2:46:33] <scrublord009> Plunder took me a bit
[2:46:34] <NiktenKing> Plunder is cool
[2:46:35] <%arancet> it just means play AFTER hitting their nexus this turn
[2:46:35] <Spiritttz> get benifit for playing a card after damage is dealt

[2:46:37] <iosephe> RAID
[2:46:41] <Louie_Salmon> Oh so just raid
[2:46:41] <%Nameloc1667> It's all about dealing damage, and THEN playing cards
[2:46:43] <%Broand> Oh it's raid
[2:46:45] <+blurblewurble> I don't really like plunder it's difficult
[2:46:46] <dagorad> you sponsored Pat?
[2:46:46] <reonome> HE'S LEARNING
[2:46:48] <Saturdaythe14th> Plunder is just "If your opponent took damage, this happens"
[2:46:57] <iosephe> Actually wait no it's Spectacle
[2:47:02] <thunderborn32> wait didn't pat previously say he wouldn't play this?
[2:47:21] <%Broand> oh it's spectacle
[2:47:21] <Louie_Salmon> Oh doesn't doesn't have to be an attack, so yeah that would be spectacle
[2:47:22] <%realm_forge> Pat is learning to handle multiple decks at once
[2:47:24] <%Ninestempest> last week he said riot is evil
[2:47:27] <%arancet> he just bitched that riot was evil, and they are
[2:47:28] <%Ninestempest> this week he said he would try
[2:47:29] <+chase959> holy shit it's 4:20-
[2:47:31] <JetpackMcQuack> Card game time magic
[2:47:34] <SilentEric> Yep. Spectacle but it doesn't change cost.

[2:48:23] <$KaosMachina> @pectusumbra POR QUE NO LOS DOS
[2:48:26] <VritraReiRei> @thunderborn32 i think you were confusing it when he loudly cursed during the podcast when he found out about this game. but that was not a curse of hate but more of "this is pulling me back in"
[2:48:31] <Spiritttz> Riot is like ellon musk it has some cool shit but simtimes they are fucking dumbasses

[2:51:32] <%TrebassTV> Challenger
[2:51:33] <Louie_Salmon> That seems very good
[2:51:40] <SomeAsianDood> @Louie_Salmon you can only swing with scouts the first time though
[2:51:40] <%MooseoneLivedhere> is this agaist real players
[2:51:46] <%Buzzard42> Scout is nuts
[2:51:47] <reonome> scouts are good shit
[2:51:48] <+R_BChe> PogChamp
[2:51:50] <plusultrachef> you had it the first time

[2:52:05] <SomeAsianDood> second time it's anyone's game
[2:52:06] <NiktenKing> YOU... DID IT
[2:52:06] <zecaptain_james> cool pat decided to look at this game
[2:52:07] <SGrim> LEARNING PogChamp
[2:52:31] <+pectusumbra> Attack with both
[2:52:34] <%arancet> now both
[2:52:36] <%Broand> swing with both?
[2:52:37] <SGrim> Almost got it
[2:52:37] <Lozovalazo1> ma-gi-oh

[2:52:40] <%Nameloc1667> Now both
[2:52:48] <SilentEric> But he'll lose
[2:52:50] <+jacintafor> youll win
[2:52:53] <%Nameloc1667> That's okay
[2:52:53] <+chase959> haha
[2:52:58] <%realm_forge> You can’t just shove your deck in there you gotta plan your moves
[2:52:58] <scrublord009> Scouts get to attack twice
[2:52:59] <+R_BChe> LUL
[2:53:01] <ShadeTheNovice> yeah pat your fine
[2:53:02] <iosephe> Lethal
[2:53:06] <Louie_Salmon> This is called "flunging"
[2:53:12] <$TheSmerdis> Skills also trigger before the attack
[2:53:12] <solidus_twitch> missed lethal
[2:53:13] <Saturdaythe14th> The point of the game is for the enemy to be dead.
[2:53:14] <Zombrocom> BIRD
[2:53:17] <%arancet> never heard of flunging, wtf?
[2:53:31] <scrublord009> this is a cool one

[2:53:56] <%SashaStarshine> @PatStaresAt Would i link the deck code in your PM or as a tweet at you?
[2:53:58] <Spiritttz> thas good
[2:54:00] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt can you show Miss Fortune to Paige?
[2:54:05] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat hey pat random question are you interested in the ninetendo theme park? I was thinking about it today after looking at an aerial shot of it
[2:54:09] <+pectusumbra> he can't block
[2:54:11] <+jacintafor> does it matter
[2:54:15] <%huskarl_zap> show misfortune to me
[2:54:21] <%Ninestempest> no that one can block
[2:54:24] <%Ninestempest> that's the one with last breath
[2:54:26] <SomeAsianDood> naw grenadier can block
[2:54:27] <+pectusumbra> oh, my bad
[2:54:32] <SomeAsianDood> you're thinking of rearguard
[2:54:36] <SilentEric> Engine should be fine I think
[2:54:36] <+R_BChe> you
[2:54:36] <+pectusumbra> it looked like borken shield
[2:54:39] <Louie_Salmon> Yoooooouuuuu
[2:54:40] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt just sent you a different deep deck that has another champion with some cool abilities
[2:54:47] <%strugglepunk2> he needs to stagger scout units
[2:54:56] <%realm_forge> It’s really bold of pat to whip his deck out on stream like this
[2:55:04] <Amedamaneku> extreme brain usage
[2:55:08] <%strugglepunk2> so mf scout mf scout mf scout
[2:55:13] <+jacintafor> all in
[2:55:16] <Spiritttz> MF is fucked yo
[2:55:18] <%strugglepunk2> or that
[2:55:21] <+Brovdignab> Scout only works once per turn @ strugglepunk2
[2:55:23] <+malacante> Does pat know about the eye
[2:55:24] <Jetsfantasy> Quinn ❤️
[2:55:28] <%Ninestempest> scout is SICK
[2:55:30] <+R_BChe> scout is pretty banana mechanic
[2:55:31] <%Ninestempest> it's super strong
[2:55:34] <Saturdaythe14th> that's not the real MF, this is a cheaty tutorial version
[2:55:34] <SilentEric> Miss Fortune Quinn decks are bananas inded
[2:55:34] <+malacante> quinn/mf is a competitve deck
[2:55:37] <T_Sasquatch> B a n a n a s
[2:55:37] <%strugglepunk2> I thought it was once per turn per unit?
[2:55:39] <%Nameloc1667> Sure is
[2:55:40] <Saturdaythe14th> this is what her level up usually does
[2:55:40] <%Ninestempest> even literally 1-2 units in a deck with scout can be a HUGE difference
[2:55:41] <+pectusumbra> MF loves shooting people many times
[2:55:44] <SomeAsianDood> and you can only swing with scouts the first time @strugglepunk2
[2:55:44] <+chase959> what about rallying after the second attack?
[2:55:44] <+Brovdignab> nope
[2:55:45] <my_dad_is_big_boss> Didn't realise you were such a big fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh's Pat
[2:55:47] <%Broand> Thats stronger than anything in MTG I think
[2:55:48] <%Bailey__gaming> Big Shrooms
[2:55:49] <DrStinkers> no such deck exists
[2:55:51] <+R_BChe> send deck pics
[2:55:52] <%Nameloc1667> @strugglepunk2 Nope, just once a turn
[2:55:53] <Amedamaneku> teemo cmonBruh
[2:55:54] <Jetsfantasy> B A N A N A S
[2:55:55] <%strugglepunk2> huh
[2:55:59] <+pectusumbra> It's challenger in revenge
[2:56:00] <Lancaster_H> Slide your decks in to Pat's PMs
[2:56:01] <%strugglepunk2> well nevermind then
[2:56:02] <scrublord009> DMs where?
[2:56:04] <%Ninestempest> teemo is kinda low tier sorry :(
[2:56:04] <%PsycoZaku> reverse challenger
[2:56:05] <T_Sasquatch> Wanna see my deck Kappa
[2:56:06] <SilentEric> People like Teemo. He isn't good per se
[2:56:07] <%TrebassTV> vulnerable is reverse Challenger
[2:56:07] <%Jekado> i like teemo tho....
[2:56:07] <+chase959> everyone loves teemo\
[2:56:08] <restingbones> Teemo is good with Plunder
[2:56:08] <%WhereIsWill> slide into pats DMs with the DEEP DECK
[2:56:08] <Spiritttz> Teemo is satan
[2:56:08] <$TheSmerdis> Vulnerable is anti challanger
[2:56:09] <BackwardCap> Teemo is just bad.
[2:56:09] <bearking05> teemos a bitch
[2:56:09] <+mykaterasu> Teemo decks are fragile
[2:56:10] <twoto858> It's the inverse of challenger
[2:56:10] <+R_BChe> reverse challenger
[2:56:11] <eco419> Kappa
[2:56:12] <garbageheaphound> Teemo is a Devil
[2:56:14] <zamzoph> Teemo's a meme deck, but not good
[2:56:16] <SilentEric> So you can build good Teemo decks
[2:56:16] <SomeAsianDood> Teemo's fun in expeditions.
[2:56:17] <%PsycoZaku> teemo is bad
[2:56:17] <%huskarl_zap> I showed my deck now show me yours psaBlep_SG
[2:56:21] <+OfficialPunGuy> Twitter DMs or Twitch DMs?
[2:56:21] <Saturdaythe14th> Teemo is goofy
[2:56:21] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat dm where?
[2:56:22] <reonome> reverse challenger
[2:56:22] <Jetsfantasy> It's opposite challanger
[2:56:22] <+malacante> Teemo/Sejuani is alright
[2:56:25] <%arancet> vulnerable is opposite of challenger, you can force that unit to defend against any of yours
[2:56:25] <+jacintafor> hell get it give him some time
[2:56:27] <+xbluestarxxx> there is a good temmo sej deck
[2:56:36] <Jetsfantasy> Enemies can pull you in instead
[2:56:36] <%Ninestempest> twitter people
[2:56:38] <%Ninestempest> not twitch
[2:56:42] <+ALazo> There are no good Teemo decks, only effective ones
[2:56:53] <+R_BChe> yep
[2:56:53] <MoonlightP> vulnerable essentially gives every unit you have challenger for that enemy card specifically
[2:56:55] <Saturdaythe14th> Control teemo is okay sometimes
[2:56:56] <%Bailey__gaming> I ment Twitter or twitch tho @patstaresat
[2:57:03] <%PsycoZaku> teemo gets sniped easily
[2:57:04] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt sent you a a teemo ezreal deck on the DMs
[2:57:05] <scrublord009> Reverse Challenger
[2:57:05] <%Nameloc1667> Yesh

[2:57:44] <%Bailey__gaming> @reonome weirdos like me lol
[2:57:47] <eco419> PogChamp
[2:57:49] <%SashaStarshine> Teemo decks have a lot of invcestment into the Teemo condition and the payoff is that they hard beat control decks, which are pretty rare @PatStaresAt
[2:57:50] <%SirGO0SE> very good to know
[2:57:50] <Spiritttz> But i want to hear them
[2:57:57] <+EyeFarted> BOOOOOOOO RTX

[3:01:30] <+StooEsq> Paige is peer pressuring the chat again
[3:01:30] <restingbones> Powder kegs are so much fun
[3:01:32] <@SoFarFetched> @saiyan24675 Unfortunately not,as the title of the video still says "broken A/C" Think it won't get fixed until Friday or next month.
[3:01:35] <crimsonsaens> Expendable Funsmiths
[3:01:40] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt sent you a a teemo ezreal deck on the DMs, it's very infuriating for the enemy when played right
[3:01:45] <TheArrow_> not as long as you'd think honestly
[3:01:46] <scrublord009> It amplifies anything that deals non combat damage
[3:01:47] <%Bluwizard21> @Agami23 u mean grandpa hassan from fate?
[3:01:48] <%heartlesshealer> save em for later streams
[3:01:49] <zamzoph> just buy them 4Head
[3:01:50] <%SashaStarshine> @PatStaresAt I sent a cheap deck you can play right now!
[3:01:52] <TheArrow_> way way way faster than hearthstone
[3:01:54] <Amedamaneku> not really you get cards fast in this game
[3:01:56] <+Pendragwn> Just spend big money
[3:01:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> !uptime
[3:01:57] <PanicSwytch> Pay to win
[3:01:58] <scrublord009> That's fine as long as you eventually make them
[3:01:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 2m.
[3:02:00] <Saturdaythe14th> There is no way pat can pilot a teemo ezreal deck anytime soon
[3:02:01] <%Binary_Fireball> anyone else's audio fucked up?
[3:02:05] <%Bailey__gaming> wildcards are your friend
[3:02:05] <Saturdaythe14th> that would melt his brain even further
[3:02:13] <$TheSmerdis> You've been getting those wild cards you can use to craft cards you're missing
[3:02:16] <Louie_Salmon> You should ask people for budget versions, there's usually something easy to put together
[3:02:22] <scrublord009> ^
[3:02:25] <%heartlesshealer> just keep the deck lists on standby for later days, Pat. Don't have to build right now
[3:02:26] <+R_BChe> u should ask for budget decks
[3:02:27] <%prof_warlock> @PatStaresAt honestly its not to much to just straight up buy all the cards for a deck
[3:02:30] <%Agami23> @Bluwizard21 no i mean ainz in the game "mass of the dead
[3:02:31] <zamzoph> D E E P
[3:02:32] <%SvenHolgersson> If you stick with one region and do dailys it doesnt take long I just maxed out Zaun like 3 days ago
[3:02:34] <%Broand> the audio fucks up on twitch regularly for me, needs a refresh typically
[3:02:37] <%Nameloc1667> You get wild cards in those random packs, so thankfully you don't ahve to rely only on randomness to get the cards
[3:02:46] <Saturdaythe14th> Pat should probably just make a deep deck, since it's easy and he likes it
[3:02:49] <%Bluwizard21> @prof_warlock that's how they getcha
[3:02:50] <93lobo> Pat no it won't you have to use those upgrades to buy cards you have so many of them
[3:02:54] <%SvenHolgersson> Now multiple decks is gunna be an issue
[3:02:55] <Saturdaythe14th> using all your wildcards on one deck isn't very hard
[3:02:59] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt THIS IS CHEAP HYPERAGGRO FACE/ BURN DECK. CEBQEAQDAMCAIAIECETTINQHAEBQEDAPDYSSQLYAAEAQCBA7
[3:03:01] <scrublord009> KEG IT UP
[3:03:02] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Actually, I think this is the most generous card game for Free-to-plays like me ive tried yet. I only played for like 2 months and I have 3 of almost every card.
[3:03:03] <93lobo> Someone tell this man how to purchase cards lmao
[3:03:05] <j0ustar> keep keggin'
[3:03:10] <my_dad_is_big_boss> Meet me in the back alley and I'll set you up with a deck for a couple of Freddo bars
[3:03:23] <+pectusumbra> it works on skills, yeah
[3:03:31] <Amedamaneku> light it up CiGrip
[3:03:34] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Okay, Two Teemo decklists sent via DM to you buddy, as well as advice on how to build one for yourself on a budget. mogwaiTeemo
[3:03:40] <SilverFaustX> why is he playing a card game
[3:03:41] <gallohuegos> !uptime
[3:03:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 3m.
[3:03:44] <%Bailey__gaming> We donkey Konging it up with these barrels
[3:03:45] <+Brovdignab> Riots revenue model has always been cosmetics not content
[3:03:45] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt sent you a a teemo ezreal deck on the DMs, it's very infuriating for the enemy when played right
[3:03:50] <%strugglepunk2> MORE POWDER
[3:03:56] <Saturdaythe14th> powderful explosion
[3:03:57] <%SashaStarshine> BARREL
[3:03:58] <MoonlightP> gangplank is pretty well represented through the mechanics
[3:04:00] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt hover over the blue eyeball on the left to see the outcome of a move. It can be very handy rather than having to figure out the outcome in your head
[3:04:00] <%Bluwizard21> that was nuts
[3:04:01] <scrublord009> KEG STONKS
[3:04:01] <93lobo> Pat go into collections and right click you can buy the cards! You have in game currency you aren't using!

[3:04:27] <crimsonsaens> It Pat going for Deep or Teemo first?
[3:04:27] <scrublord009> Puffcap is a must in teemo decks
[3:04:31] <+malacante> Looks like you can free play expedition this week which is probably worth
[3:04:36] <+Pendragwn> we can't
[3:04:39] <Saturdaythe14th> Puffcap is a better card than teemo is half the time
[3:04:41] <SilentEric> Alright
[3:04:42] <Kalcom> just use money
[3:04:43] <zamzoph> yeyeye

[3:05:49] <%SashaStarshine> Arachnophillia
[3:05:51] <nepwar> get dat arachno dick
[3:05:52] <%SvenHolgersson> SIPDERS
[3:05:52] <%Mendin> Neverglade Collector + Spiders = Yes
[3:05:52] <bigdumbstreams> 1
[3:05:54] <+R_BChe> arach
[3:05:55] <HarmlessCrow> Neverglade wins games
[3:05:55] <%Ninestempest> middle or left
[3:05:59] <crimsonsaens> If you see a deep card, pick it
[3:05:59] <HarmlessCrow> Ancient Evil
[3:06:00] <$Tuskor13> Kinetic CARd
[3:06:01] <%strugglepunk2> AE
[3:06:01] <+jacintafor> spider
[3:06:01] <%Ninestempest> neverglade op op
[3:06:03] <$valkuma> Twisted Fate AKA How every redditor sees themself.
[3:06:05] <%Mendin> Fresh Offerings is a trap pat
[3:06:06] <%Bailey__gaming> Big Spiders big power
[3:06:07] <%SashaStarshine> Ancient Evil
[3:06:08] <Louie_Salmon> Fresh offerings is hard to use
[3:06:08] <%Ninestempest> ye ye ye
[3:06:12] <crimsonsaens> Fresh Offerings is really bad
[3:06:12] <MoonlightP> actually ancient evil is great
[3:06:13] <%Ninestempest> ooooooooo
[3:06:15] <SilentEric> Black Spear over fresh offerings I think
[3:06:16] <%Ninestempest> actually right
[3:06:16] <bigdumbstreams> left is definitely best your gut is right
[3:06:18] <%strugglepunk2> YO THATS GREAT WITH SPIDER
[3:06:18] <SomeAsianDood> black speaer take a blackspear
[3:06:19] <+pectusumbra> probably ancient evil
[3:06:19] <Kalcom> fresh offering is bad really
[3:06:20] <%Ninestempest> black spear op
[3:06:21] <MoonlightP> removal is high value in expeditions
[3:06:21] <%Mendin> a Neverglade is a better mischief and balck spear is removal
[3:06:31] <HarmlessCrow> Neverglade is absolutely nuts in Expeditions if they can't remove
[3:06:35] <%Ninestempest> GET NEVERGLADE
[3:06:36] <%SashaStarshine> First to the draw
[3:06:36] <Saturdaythe14th> black spear is just a better card than fresh offerings, yeah
[3:06:38] <+R_BChe> 2'
[3:06:40] <%SashaStarshine> so you have a 1 drop
[3:06:42] <solidus_twitch> afterlife mann
[3:06:46] <%strugglepunk2> More neverglade yeah
[3:06:47] <Spiritttz> evil sounds good
[3:06:48] <solidus_twitch> vengeance is super useful
[3:06:49] <+pectusumbra> he has one
[3:06:51] <zamzoph> Afterlife
[3:06:52] <bigdumbstreams> right is the best
[3:06:54] <+blurblewurble> ye been warned is a great card
[3:06:55] <HarmlessCrow> Don't take three factions you'll look like a nerd
[3:06:55] <%Bailey__gaming> 1 or 2
[3:06:57] <%PsycoZaku> I cn
[3:06:59] <Kalcom> evil!
[3:07:03] <MoonlightP> 1 imo
[3:07:04] <+pectusumbra> I'd pick evil here, but it's preference
[3:07:04] <Louie_Salmon> 1 and 2 are both okay
[3:07:09] <%AnIrishPapaya> AnIrishPapaya subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Pat. Really enjoyed the Runeterra stream. Felt bad for you in those challenges though. I feel like just having a guide in Discord would have made that go a lot smoother instead of the mess that is chat. Hope we can see more in the future!
[3:07:11] <+jacintafor> @PatStaresAt pat can we just have chat type 1 2 or 3
[3:07:11] <%SvenHolgersson> ancient evil
[3:07:14] <Saturdaythe14th> 1 or 3

[3:07:15] <+R_BChe> yes
[3:07:17] <%Ninestempest> ye
[3:07:17] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt The more you pick a named group, the more you'll be offered it!
[3:07:18] <MoonlightP> having your champion consistently is important for expeditions

[3:07:32] <Kalcom> 1
[3:07:32] <bigdumbstreams> avarosan sentry is a bait not actually that good ;(
[3:07:33] <$galaxyswirl> id say 1 cause it gives you a 2 cost
[3:07:34] <%Ninestempest> 1 is better early game curve, 2 is better overall
[3:07:35] <%Bailey__gaming> 1 is evil, 2 is middle
[3:07:40] <+jacintafor> 2 or 3
[3:07:41] <crimsonsaens> 2
[3:07:46] <DrStinkers> 3
[3:07:47] <Saturdaythe14th> This is a hard pick

[3:08:15] <+R_BChe> 1
[3:08:17] <restingbones> @SvenHolgersson They nerfed it again, so its not as bad as it used to be
[3:08:19] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Mouse over the name for a description on what the cards are for. The more you pick a group like Ancient Evil, the more it'll be offered to you!
[3:08:20] <Spiritttz> 1 or 2
[3:08:20] <$galaxyswirl> 2
[3:08:21] <Kalcom> i say 3
[3:08:21] <%AnIrishPapaya> You really get people's opinions on cards in chat. Pretty funny
[3:08:25] <%strugglepunk2> 2
[3:08:25] <%SvenHolgersson> @restingbones Still hate it
[3:08:26] <MoonlightP> 3 is great cards but might dilute your draft
[3:08:26] <solidus_twitch> 2'
[3:08:27] <shubachi> 2
[3:08:27] <reonome> this is gonna be a mess i love it
[3:08:28] <+pectusumbra> 1 or 2 I guess
[3:08:30] <%Bailey__gaming> 3 the alpha claw is great
[3:08:31] <+condor_fiend> your going to want some lower cost guys at some point
[3:08:31] <Saturdaythe14th> 2
[3:08:32] <+malacante> 3
[3:08:32] <restingbones> @SvenHolgersson thats fair
[3:08:33] <%WheatlyXT> he needs lower cost cards
[3:08:36] <Saturdaythe14th> we need some early game
[3:08:37] <crimsonsaens> If you see deep, pick deep
[3:08:41] <+R_BChe> 2
[3:08:42] <Louie_Salmon> Your curve is really high yeah
[3:08:47] <nepwar> nah just go all big cards
[3:08:50] <+R_BChe> we need more low counts
[3:08:51] <Kalcom> worst one lul
[3:08:54] <bigdumbstreams> 1 best

[3:09:42] <reonome> careful about costs
[3:09:45] <%SvenHolgersson> I fucking hate that deck
[3:09:45] <%Nameloc1667> Afterlife
[3:09:46] <Kalcom> 1
[3:09:46] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Expedition decks are smaller than constructed decks. So you hit DEEP sooner!
[3:09:47] <%PerrinIsDead> 112

[3:09:49] <+jacintafor> 1 or 2

[3:10:01] <%PerrinIsDead> 7
[3:10:01] <+malacante> skitterer v stronk
[3:10:02] <%strugglepunk2> 1
[3:10:02] <%Bailey__gaming> 1
[3:10:07] <+pectusumbra> the box is good right?
[3:10:08] <Saturdaythe14th> 1 has the box in it which is a terrible card, though
[3:10:09] <VirtuaRailith> skitter is one of the best 3 drops in the game
[3:10:10] <MoonlightP> skitterer is strong
[3:10:10] <bigdumbstreams> box is situational :/
[3:10:13] <bigdumbstreams> 1
[3:10:13] <reonome> THE CUBE
[3:10:13] <+jacintafor> 1
[3:10:14] <$galaxyswirl> 111111111111111111111111111111111111111
[3:10:14] <%WheatlyXT> what's in the box
[3:10:16] <%SvenHolgersson> THAT ONE
[3:10:16] <restingbones> Whats in it?
[3:10:17] <bigdumbstreams> dont even look at the others lol
[3:10:17] <+Dotta5> you can trade it all for what's in this box
[3:10:18] <Tempmael> 1
[3:10:21] <+R_BChe> 1 free
[3:10:21] <%SvenHolgersson> COMMANDER IS BUSTED
[3:10:22] <$galaxyswirl> COMMANDER IS BROKEN
[3:10:23] <VirtuaRailith> ledros is easy
[3:10:27] <solidus_twitch> LEDROS MY BOY
[3:10:28] <%strugglepunk2> 11
[3:10:29] <%SvenHolgersson> FUCK THAT CARD
[3:10:29] <%BubbaRands> cant have too many blighted
[3:10:29] <VirtuaRailith> good enough to be a champ
[3:10:32] <Saturdaythe14th> ledros ledros ledros ledros
[3:10:33] <MoonlightP> ledros isn't broken, but he's good enough
[3:10:35] <+blurblewurble> COMMANDER IS SO GOOD
[3:10:38] <solidus_twitch> 2 is nice
[3:10:38] <%SvenHolgersson> He's better than 80% of the champs
[3:10:41] <+jacintafor> 1 or 3
[3:10:42] <MoonlightP> gives you a clear ender at least
[3:10:42] <solidus_twitch> for that rekindler
[3:10:42] <+pectusumbra> little heave
[3:10:42] <bigdumbstreams> 1
[3:10:47] <+pectusumbra> need some smaller cards soon
[3:10:47] <%SvenHolgersson> Fuck him how did they think that card was okay
[3:10:48] <Tempmael> 1 scout op
[3:10:50] <+CozyCoat> 1
[3:10:51] <+blurblewurble> 2
[3:10:53] <%strugglepunk2> 1
[3:10:54] <DrStinkers> 1
[3:10:56] <MoonlightP> we shouldn't have picked TF tbh
[3:11:02] <MoonlightP> not enough draw or synergy
[3:11:07] <+pectusumbra> ah actually I'm reading it wrong
[3:11:07] <+CozyCoat> 3
[3:11:10] <bigdumbstreams> rekindler would be better if you have better champions
[3:11:11] <Spiritttz> 3
[3:11:12] <solidus_twitch> slotbot lmao
[3:11:15] <bigdumbstreams> not that good for elise/tf :/
[3:11:18] <Saturdaythe14th> tf is a win condition if nobody kills him and he's always a solid play, so picking him was fine
[3:11:22] <+jacintafor> 1
[3:11:23] <solidus_twitch> 1 is goo
[3:11:26] <MoonlightP> 3 imo
[3:11:30] <Saturdaythe14th> 1 or 3
[3:11:31] <+pectusumbra> what is slotbox
[3:11:32] <%arancet> you have a lot of mid cost cards, may want some more cheap ones
[3:11:33] <bigdumbstreams> 2
[3:11:34] <restingbones> You don't want too many expensive cards, youll get crushed by rush decks.
[3:11:34] <Kalcom> killing is great tho
[3:11:35] <Saturdaythe14th> 1 for card draw probably
[3:11:35] <%WheatlyXT> more glimpse
[3:11:36] <%Mendin> Someone teach pat about BREAD
[3:11:39] <+blurblewurble> slotbot is really good but only if you build around it
[3:11:42] <+condor_fiend> 3
[3:11:44] <Saturdaythe14th> we don't have enough stuff to use chronicler on
[3:11:44] <Louie_Salmon> 3?
[3:11:44] <MoonlightP> nah
[3:11:46] <Kalcom> remember you need mana
[3:11:46] <%SvenHolgersson> DEATHS DOOR
[3:11:47] <awildgooseappears> slootbot best bot
[3:11:49] <MoonlightP> ruination is sloooooooooow
[3:11:51] <%Broand> boardwipe huh
[3:11:52] <+Quack_of_Dawn> 2
[3:11:52] <%WheatlyXT> get more glimpse
[3:11:53] <Tempmael> 2
[3:11:53] <%Nameloc1667> Death's Door for sure
[3:11:54] <MoonlightP> 1 or 3
[3:11:55] <%WheatlyXT> 1
[3:11:56] <Spiritttz> 2 is fine
[3:11:56] <+Dre_> 2
[3:11:58] <%Bailey__gaming> kill all humans
[3:12:00] <reonome> 1
[3:12:02] <+pectusumbra> 2
[3:12:04] <+CozyCoat> 1
[3:12:04] <+malacante> this deck is slow enough we want ruination
[3:12:04] <%SvenHolgersson> That drain is legit broken
[3:12:05] <%strugglepunk2> 1
[3:12:06] <Saturdaythe14th> we're a slow deck so I guess ruination is what we need
[3:12:11] <Kalcom> you use all your mana in it
[3:12:12] <MoonlightP> hmm
[3:12:13] <Spiritttz> board wipe + removal
[3:12:23] <+jacintafor> swap warned
[3:12:25] <%WheatlyXT> trade box for glimpse
[3:12:26] <DrStinkers> 1
[3:12:26] <HarmlessCrow> Take Hapless
[3:12:30] <%strugglepunk2> yeah
[3:12:32] <+blurblewurble> swap salvage
[3:12:33] <%strugglepunk2> 1
[3:12:35] <+condor_fiend> swap 3

[3:12:47] <solidus_twitch> i mean 3
[3:12:47] <+pectusumbra> hapless?
[3:12:48] <reonome> 1 or 3
[3:12:48] <MoonlightP> these are all good trades to take
[3:12:49] <%SvenHolgersson> 3 is better on curve
[3:12:50] <%Nameloc1667> 3
[3:12:50] <Saturdaythe14th> well honestly all of these are good swaps
[3:12:51] <%Piratekittycat98> get the box outta herer
[3:12:51] <restingbones> Yeah, Box is good when its good, but its rarely good
[3:12:51] <+malacante> hapless is great in this dekc
[3:12:58] <Louie_Salmon> You could swap all of them really
[3:13:00] <+Dotta5> Huge deck
[3:13:01] <+jacintafor> 0-2 inc.
[3:13:01] <VirtuaRailith> how's pat been doing today?
[3:13:02] <%Nameloc1667> Yeah!
[3:13:03] <+condor_fiend> you want to be able to play a card turn 1
[3:13:05] <Kalcom> look at thisloss
[3:13:07] <SpookySpaghooti> Pat is a shark
[3:13:08] <Saturdaythe14th> hapless is probably the most consistent I guess
[3:13:15] <+pectusumbra> it's decent enough curve.
[3:13:19] <%WheatlyXT> box is too conditional for me to ever want to use sadly
[3:13:20] <%Bailey__gaming> @virtuarailith hey kev
[3:13:22] <+Dotta5> Girls are impressed with the size of you deck
[3:13:23] <solidus_twitch> YOU GOT THIS
[3:13:23] <MoonlightP> man TF was not the best champ pick i think
[3:13:23] <+Kawaso> butts
[3:13:24] <VirtuaRailith> he just has to survive til leadros
[3:13:25] <bigdumbstreams> great thing about expeditions you get 2 tries :D
[3:13:27] <reonome> gl pat
[3:13:28] <TheArrow_> that's okay neither do we :)
[3:13:29] <Kalcom> you want all your 1 cost cards
[3:13:33] <%SvenHolgersson> Seriously though Commander Ledros made me ragequit
[3:13:33] <+malacante> Tf is fine as just a value caqrd
[3:13:34] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah we probably won't be fast enough to give you advice so you're gonna have to pilot good

[3:13:36] <%miguelrod777> godspeed

[3:15:49] <%ryome> Oh man, Pat playing card games! The chat is going to backseat while gobolins drive!
[3:15:49] <zamzoph> ATTACK
[3:15:52] <+Pendragwn> you really fucked up when you listened to chat while drafting
[3:15:52] <MyNameIsRasus> not worth it
[3:15:53] <VirtuaRailith> @Bailey__gaming him losing is funnier
[3:15:58] <Kalcom> I woulda sacrificed my hero
[3:16:04] <MoonlightP> i'd have attacked through
[3:16:05] <TheArrow_> that used to be a 4/4
[3:16:05] <Saturdaythe14th> In fairness he asked for the help
[3:16:05] <reonome> not worth losing champ
[3:16:12] <+condor_fiend> @Pendragwn yeah
[3:16:20] <BoneBagMel> he should have dodge rolled cancel intro super
[3:16:22] <bigdumbstreams> LOL
[3:16:25] <Kalcom> die
[3:16:26] <crimsonsaens> This is really bad
[3:16:27] <nepwar> LUL
[3:16:28] <zamzoph> should've attacked last turn
[3:16:29] <%Bailey__gaming> @virtuarailith fair enough its quality content
[3:16:30] <scrublord009> damacia curve is real
[3:16:30] <%SvenHolgersson> Gotta eat it
[3:16:30] <bigdumbstreams> oh no
[3:16:31] <DrStinkers> you're pretty boned
[3:16:34] <+Pendragwn> oh god you literally did the only wrong play
[3:16:35] <+MillerLowlife> yield or perish, i think
[3:16:37] <bigdumbstreams> i think you are boned
[3:16:43] <Zombrocom> He's curving good on you
[3:16:45] <LordWaldemaart> ???
[3:16:46] <$galaxyswirl> block then use the kill own card, would still block and would have given u a draw 2 @PatStaresAt
[3:16:56] <+jacintafor> sacrifice elise
[3:16:57] <%SvenHolgersson> welp
[3:16:58] <Saturdaythe14th> The draft options we were presented with were kind of terrible if you think about it
[3:16:59] <+R_BChe> neverglade
[3:17:01] <$galaxyswirl> fuck
[3:17:02] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah you could have drawn 2 for free
[3:17:05] <Spiritttz> haveing more than 1 glimps is freaking rough
[3:17:05] <%SvenHolgersson> that mulligan fucked you hard
[3:17:05] <Saturdaythe14th> very few low cost things
[3:17:11] <%Ninestempest> ????
[3:17:14] <%Nameloc1667> Pat no
[3:17:15] <bigdumbstreams> youll learn!
[3:17:19] <bigdumbstreams> eventually :D
[3:17:19] <MoonlightP> it's fine
[3:17:20] <%Ninestempest> they'll just block and kill u
[3:17:24] <93lobo> Pat give it time you'll learn
[3:17:24] <MoonlightP> the game's hard, esp expeditions
[3:17:28] <+jacintafor> thats a good move he can sac for cards
[3:17:29] <Spiritttz> ya
[3:17:31] <+R_BChe> not bad
[3:17:31] <scrublord009> this why i dont really fuck with expeditions
[3:17:33] <reonome> pat should summon
[3:17:33] <Spiritttz> gata do it
[3:17:34] <%Ninestempest> i... guess...
[3:17:34] <+Pendragwn> you're implying you actual thought about what you suggested when I thought we were just spamming stuff in chat
[3:17:36] <+condor_fiend> ????
[3:17:38] <reonome> rip elise
[3:17:39] <crimsonsaens> Maybe it was a bad idea to go straight into expeditions
[3:17:39] <LoneFonte> sure
[3:17:40] <Spiritttz> play into that ruination baby
[3:17:40] <T_Sasquatch> ??
[3:17:41] <%SvenHolgersson> ??
[3:17:46] <+blastazoid26> ???
[3:17:46] <VirtuaRailith> The rule for expeditioin is just pick demacia
[3:17:50] <VirtuaRailith> that's how you get easy wins
[3:17:51] <%SvenHolgersson> But now you dont get damage on him
[3:17:52] <bearking05> but why
[3:17:59] <LordWaldemaart> ?????????
[3:17:59] <Spiritttz> he needs cards
[3:17:59] <+R_BChe> y yall ??, she wouldve died anw
[3:18:00] <MoonlightP> demacia + ionia is easiest way to play i think
[3:18:01] <%SvenHolgersson> OH WE DONE
[3:18:01] <zamzoph> BOX
[3:18:01] <crimsonsaens> box
[3:18:04] <VirtuaRailith> oh no
[3:18:04] <%SvenHolgersson> ASHE IS HERE
[3:18:04] <+malacante> pat read
[3:18:05] <93lobo> An advanced tip use a card to block and then use the magic card with a shoe to destroy the card before it is attacked letting you block and draw two cards
[3:18:05] <BlackermanZX> elise was dead anyway right
[3:18:08] <Spiritttz> elise is for early
[3:18:11] <Kalcom> this is what happens when you hear more than one person making a deck
[3:18:11] <$galaxyswirl> pat dont know
[3:18:13] <T_Sasquatch> Why would you kill elise when you had a baby spoder
[3:18:15] <crimsonsaens> just surrender, this game is over
[3:18:16] <LordWaldemaart> But she would have dealt dmg
[3:18:17] <Zombrocom> Oh no, chat is arguing with each other
[3:18:20] <%Nameloc1667> Glimpse
[3:18:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Glimpse beyond

[3:18:59] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[3:19:01] <Kalcom> deck sucks
[3:19:01] <+Pendragwn> AngriestPay wouldn't have had his balls show this much on stream PepeHands
[3:19:03] <Spiritttz> rop
[3:19:03] <BlackermanZX> well crap LUL
[3:19:08] <%SvenHolgersson> You should keep some spells in your opening hand if you can
[3:19:08] <DrStinkers> shame concede is strong in the current meta
[3:19:09] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt sent dirt cheap meta deck on twitter
[3:19:11] <+malacante> skip
[3:19:16] <%WheatlyXT> you could've pulled that around. One mistake doesn't mean a loss
[3:19:17] <nepwar> patstaresat: D E F E A T
[3:19:17] <crimsonsaens> 1
[3:19:19] <%bevyrage> who the fuck is angriestpay?
[3:19:19] <reonome> get more low cost cards
[3:19:20] <LoneFonte> nah
[3:19:22] <+condor_fiend> no trade
[3:19:24] <Kalcom> 1
[3:19:25] <%Nameloc1667> No trades
[3:19:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Can't wait until you check your twitter DMs, you're gonna laugh at that big number
[3:19:27] <Spiritttz> no trade
[3:19:28] <%Ninestempest> Pat, a really important thign to learn in this game is that you only attack when you know you can come out of the situation better. If they have blockers with more health there's no reason to attack unless you have cards to kill them
[3:19:44] <$galaxyswirl> no
[3:19:46] <VirtuaRailith> no
[3:19:47] <dinnydanny777> Are ya winning?
[3:19:48] <%Ninestempest> no
[3:19:52] <+blastazoid26> no
[3:19:52] <VirtuaRailith> you have late game cards like leadros
[3:19:52] <Saturdaythe14th> It means you gotta wait until you have a better board
[3:19:53] <%SvenHolgersson> no you just win later
[3:19:53] <Louie_Salmon> You can just keep waiting
[3:19:54] <%Nameloc1667> No, you can wait and build
[3:19:54] <%bevyrage> psa3guy
[3:19:55] <reonome> he didn't say NEVER attack
[3:19:55] <VirtuaRailith> so you can stall out the board
[3:19:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Teemo Fizz oh god
[3:19:59] <@SoFarFetched> no cause sometimes the enemy won't attack either
[3:20:00] <Daebunz> only point of health that matters is the last one
[3:20:01] <%Ninestempest> having a developed board is the best way to win in this game
[3:20:04] <%hzealot> @patstaresat nexus hp is a resource
[3:20:04] <%SvenHolgersson> KEEP DRAIN
[3:20:06] <%bevyrage> don't forget pat that you store mana
[3:20:09] <Saturdaythe14th> We have super slow cards too, yeah, so waiting should be good for us
[3:20:10] <+pectusumbra> In fighting games, you gotta block right? If you just swing all the time you eat combo
[3:20:11] <crimsonsaens> keep 2
[3:20:15] <DrStinkers> remember you can builkd spell mana for 2 turns
[3:20:15] <dinnydanny777> Pick the one that makes it easier for you to win
[3:20:16] <%Nameloc1667> Keep that brood and the drain
[3:20:18] <%Mendin> Your life is also a resource, sometimes taking attacks to maintain your board and improve on it might be better
[3:20:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you don't have to attack every turn you can possibly attack.
[3:20:25] <MyNameIsRasus> The only HP that matters is the one that keeps you alive
[3:20:26] <crimsonsaens> 4
[3:20:26] <+R_BChe> LUL

[3:20:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> this deck doesn't feel great
[3:20:37] <Saturdaythe14th> you can kill teemo next turn
[3:20:37] <%Nameloc1667> Pass
[3:20:37] <MoonlightP> it's fine, you have black spear
[3:20:39] <Snirtax> Before you confirm the attack, try and think about what you'd do if you were the opponent. If it seems like he'd come out on top, and you can afford to not swing, don't
[3:20:40] <scrublord009> OH NO TEEMO
[3:20:42] <BlackermanZX> Get Teemo'd
[3:20:42] <viewtifulr> its your planned card
[3:20:42] <+pectusumbra> it's alright. you'll handle it
[3:20:43] <%Mendin> Next turn cast Coral, Ye Been Warned, Teemo's dead
[3:20:46] <+malacante> you can kill with coral+ye been next round

[3:25:01] <Kalcom> fucked it up
[3:25:01] <TyrantBelial> If you attack she summons a spider.
[3:25:02] <%Nameloc1667> Nameloc1667 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Wooo
[3:25:03] <zamzoph> F
[3:25:04] <Saturdaythe14th> eh it's okay
[3:25:08] <+R_BChe> f
[3:25:08] <%Mendin> This works
[3:25:09] <+pectusumbra> ah damn it
[3:25:13] <+R_BChe> so they cant play a unit card
[3:25:14] <%bevyrage> this works fine don't worry
[3:25:14] <Kalcom> read elise
[3:25:14] <$galaxyswirl> he couldnt have blocked at all
[3:25:15] <TheArrow_> so your opponent can't play cards
[3:25:15] <Louie_Salmon> He can't respond
[3:25:15] <Spiritttz> so they cant cast spells
[3:25:16] <LordWaldemaart> Attack first so he cant play another card
[3:25:16] <%Mendin> Because he wouldnt have been able to play Kallista
[3:25:17] <crimsonsaens> Elise
[3:25:19] <DrStinkers> he can't block elise with the 1 atk
[3:25:20] <+pectusumbra> so that elise could get through but it's fine
[3:25:20] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt frog can't block elise, spawn spider
[3:25:20] <%Nameloc1667> I'd say pass
[3:25:22] <GPAlpha> Because it would have stopped the Kalista summon
[3:25:23] <+R_BChe> ye
[3:25:23] <Louie_Salmon> YES
[3:25:23] <%s_xylocalsingles> YES
[3:25:23] <LoneFonte> so they don't put that 4/3
[3:25:24] <%Mendin> Attack with Coral, see if he blocks/kills it
[3:25:24] <+blastazoid26> read elise
[3:25:24] <zamzoph> YES
[3:25:24] <+azure22900> Cause now you're dealing with a 4/3
[3:25:24] <%SvenHolgersson> YUP
[3:25:24] <Tempmael> yup
[3:25:24] <Spiritttz> yup
[3:25:24] <reonome> yes
[3:25:24] <twoto858> Yeah
[3:25:24] <+pectusumbra> right
[3:25:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> YUP
[3:25:26] <crimsonsaens> YES
[3:25:26] <$galaxyswirl> HOW
[3:25:27] <SGrim> Yes
[3:25:30] <+AceVenturaPhD> not at the moment of attack
[3:25:31] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt attack with the litte guy, use the black spear to kill kallista
[3:25:32] <+pectusumbra> glimpse coral boy
[3:25:32] <Saturdaythe14th> You can only react to attacks with spells
[3:25:33] <crimsonsaens> Attack and cast Black Spear
[3:25:33] <%SvenHolgersson> Summoning is slow and takes the entire turn
[3:25:34] <GPAlpha> It goes straight to combat phase
[3:25:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Part of the Strategie
[3:25:34] <NiktenKing> Yes
[3:25:35] <MoonlightP> it's fine
[3:25:37] <+blastazoid26> READ elise
[3:25:38] <%Mendin> If he kills the coral on block, you can Spear kallista
[3:25:39] <T_Sasquatch> Swing first Swing first
[3:25:39] <Jetsfantasy> Only if you attack with cards already played
[3:25:40] <LoneFonte> now you know tho!
[3:25:40] <%Ninestempest> Yeah I told you this earlier
[3:25:41] <Spiritttz> you know now so its fine
[3:25:43] <%Mendin> aaa
[3:25:45] <Haarute> we learning boys
[3:25:47] <flyingtentaclemonster> they can but they have to summon after the attack
[3:25:47] <crimsonsaens> WTF?
[3:25:48] <awildgooseappears> they can only use a fast or burst spell on attack fase
[3:25:49] <+azure22900> nononono#
[3:25:50] <zamzoph> ????
[3:25:51] <Louie_Salmon> You should have saved that
[3:25:53] <+klassikFrank> wat
[3:25:55] <T_Sasquatch> I honestly never knew that LUL
[3:25:57] <$galaxyswirl> PERFECT
[3:25:59] <+blastazoid26> ???
[3:26:02] <+shotlock> Did you know that when you right click a card, you can view the original full card art by clicking the eye icon near the bottom?
[3:26:03] <$galaxyswirl> CARD YOU NEEDED
[3:26:04] <+malacante> grasp lines up nice into kalista
[3:26:04] <+klassikFrank> I don't understand of that
[3:26:08] <+R_BChe> oh god
[3:26:09] <Saturdaythe14th> maokai in draft
[3:26:17] <Saturdaythe14th> this guy is adventurous
[3:26:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> anyone else want to try the BIG NUMBER deck?
[3:26:25] <Kalcom> lul maokai in 20 cards or less
[3:26:30] <zamzoph> attack!
[3:26:33] <Kalcom> just stall and you win
[3:26:39] <MoonlightP> he's doing it
[3:26:40] <Saturdaythe14th> They can summon after your attack obviously
[3:26:42] <%Nameloc1667> Read her man
[3:26:43] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah of course it would work like that
[3:26:45] <%SvenHolgersson> Thats why elise is fucking great
[3:26:47] <GPAlpha> It's basically more tech
[3:26:49] <+xXjuffelXx> He learn
[3:26:49] <Saturdaythe14th> but it lets you do this, yeah
[3:26:49] <%TheWinged7> that change everything
[3:26:50] <Louie_Salmon> Why wouldn't it work like that?
[3:26:50] <DrStinkers> That's a huge part of the game's strategy
[3:26:50] <%Chichen> CHANGE ALL
[3:26:53] <+pectusumbra> now glimpse that spider for more cards
[3:26:54] <%SvenHolgersson> Big Learnding

[3:27:18] <SpookySpaghooti> Ledros baby
[3:27:22] <Tempmael> elise cant be blocked by weak cards either
[3:27:27] <+malacante> see now you just gotta stall and ledros will win the game
[3:27:30] <SpookySpaghooti> VIle Feast at EOT
[3:27:31] <zamzoph> pass

[3:29:30] <Spiritttz> eh fuck it
[3:29:32] <%Mendin> He's trying to level Maokai
[3:29:44] <%Mendin> Since it's a mixture of card tossing and his guys dying

[3:29:47] <+pectusumbra> next round
[3:29:53] <restingbones> @Ninestempest only good because he is versitile when you play him, and if you manage pull it off he is really good, as he should be. big risk big reward.

[3:41:20] <scrublord009> you had it
[3:41:21] <mar_krow> who said scout
[3:41:21] <flyingtentaclemonster> that was not correct

[3:41:22] <%JonathLP> the misplays
[3:41:23] <+Limp_Handshake> lol you had like 4 chances to win
[3:41:23] <MyNameIsRasus> You're dead
[3:41:24] <SGrim> Pat really doesn't know how to play this game.
[3:41:24] <+notcyrus> lmao just finding the dumbest guy in chat to listen to every time
[3:41:25] <$Afterman_> he didnt have enoughh cards to block it all
[3:41:25] <%Quigsies> DSPat

[3:41:29] <%Agami23> pat you had check mate and then ate your own piece to give your opponent the win
[3:41:29] <twoto858> One Guy'd once again
[3:41:29] <arsonisthawk23> Thats the kind of HIGH QUALITY entertainment im looking for!
[3:41:31] <%Aeoneth> I don't understand anything about this game and even I know that was a bad play
[3:41:31] <+pectusumbra> I think it's over now
[3:41:32] <awildgooseappears> i love how everything that could've gone wrong did
[3:41:33] <%bevyrage> DEFEAT SNATCHED FROM THE JAWS OF VICTORY?
[3:41:37] <Haarute> i mean at this point this guy thinks pat is fucking with him so who's really winning the mental game
[3:41:41] <+AceVenturaPhD> ah well hes still learning
[3:41:43] <%JonathLP> ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS SWEEP
[3:41:43] <+KevinsLunchbox> you would have wob
[3:41:43] <mar_krow> pat veil
[3:41:44] <+the_krypto_knight> Pat is really good at finding the worst play LUL
[3:41:46] <%R3Roundabout> Sometimes chat plays, sometimes Pat throws. Such is stream
[3:41:47] <+blastazoid26> Are you even reading your cards?
[3:41:47] <scrublord009> 3 times one guy destroy the game
[3:41:48] <restingbones> Pat if you has attacked with all LIKE WE SAID youd have won
[3:41:50] <Damie904> If yall are gonna throw Pat hints can you just explain the whole play? Not tell him one card and be mad he doesnt figure out the 6 card combo?
[3:41:56] <SGrim> @Haarute chat is. We'll break Pat.
[3:41:57] <$galaxyswirl> U LITTERLY COULD HAVE JUST WON
[3:41:57] <%kp539000> missed lethal :/
[3:42:01] <Venchair> it's basic math
[3:42:02] <Saturdaythe14th> we can use offerings now at least
[3:42:03] <LoneFonte> rip
[3:42:03] <%Ninestempest> pat missed lethal like 3 times
[3:42:04] <LordWaldemaart> Pat is too big brained to simply win guys
[3:42:12] <%R3Roundabout> So many missed lethals
[3:42:13] <Spiritttz> he didnt know the guy couldnt block
[3:42:17] <BlackermanZX> You literally had it LUL
[3:42:18] <Louie_Salmon> I don't even know if you can still win
[3:42:22] <+klassikFrank> THE TABLES ARE TURNING
[3:42:25] <reonome> pat needs to learn what fearsome is
[3:42:25] <+R_BChe> commander next turn
[3:42:25] <+blastazoid26> f
[3:42:26] <%bevyrage> literally telling pat to drop commander and sweep the deck and he doesn't read the advice isn't our fault
[3:42:27] <DrStinkers> This is gonna be really confused when it turns out he isn't getting BM'd
[3:42:28] <Venchair> I mean it's over
[3:42:29] <restingbones> Thew it all away
[3:42:31] <%Reevesypoo> WHY IS ELMO STREAMING

[3:43:44] <%bevyrage> and you don't notice it
[3:43:46] <awildgooseappears> youre dead even if he doesnt attack
[3:43:47] <+Limp_Handshake> ya lost time for next lol
[3:43:48] <j0ustar> Snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.
[3:43:49] <crimsonsaens> They both played bad
[3:43:49] <viewtifulr> the one guy
[3:43:50] <%Jekado> is it bad manners its LoL isn't it suppose to be like this
[3:43:50] <Spiritttz> is there any direct damage in his deck?
[3:43:50] <zamzoph> "good game Kappa "
[3:43:52] <restingbones> Aw what a fucker. Fuck you Dariaxe
[3:43:53] <%kp539000> yeah u missed lethal a ton
[3:43:53] <$galaxyswirl> so u totally threw the game twice, once cause of one guy, the second cause of yourself
[3:43:56] <mar_krow> honest one guy said use elise
[3:43:56] <CherrieVelvet> one guy killed pat
[3:43:57] <Saturdaythe14th> You lost when you attacked with the scout lady
[3:43:57] <Louie_Salmon> You threw
[3:44:00] <BackwardCap> A well deserved L OWLnice
[3:44:02] <Saturdaythe14th> because the scout got killed for free
[3:44:04] <+lethallylactic> Guys, should it be illegal to be One Guy?
[3:44:04] <+R_BChe> but u lose an extra body
[3:44:06] <BlackermanZX> Welp you outplayed yourself in that one turn LUL
[3:44:06] <+condor_fiend> it happens
[3:44:06] <%BubbaRands> well fuck him
[3:44:07] <+R_BChe> for the main attack
[3:44:07] <%Ninestempest> BUT THAT KILLED YOUR UNIT AND YOU HAD LESS UNITS
[3:44:08] <%bevyrage> you needed to attack with EVERYTHING
[3:44:08] <$galaxyswirl> that was the reason why you lost
[3:44:08] <twoto858> You needed all of them to win
[3:44:09] <Venchair> a scout is only useful when ahead
[3:44:10] <Saturdaythe14th> the scout attack was pointless, that's what happened
[3:44:10] <%kp539000> yeah and then he chumped the scout
[3:44:11] <flyingtentaclemonster> just surrender
[3:44:13] <%R3Roundabout> Can't believe you lost that
[3:44:13] <%Nekros4442> You needed to attack with everyone....
[3:44:13] <arsonisthawk23> A hard fought L
[3:44:14] <+klassikFrank> You lost the extra body form the scout adn gave him a chance to sumon
[3:44:14] <KingKZ> This is why I don't play games like this.
[3:44:14] <DrStinkers> It was 6 attackerss vs 5 nlockers
[3:44:14] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt when you did the scout first, he killed it so you couldn't outnumber him anymore
[3:44:16] <%Ninestempest> YOU NEEDED TO HAVE MORE UNITS SO 1 UNIT GOT THROUGH
[3:44:17] <TheArrow_> because he got to play cards after you attacked
[3:44:17] <Spiritttz> One of your opponents guys couldnt block
[3:44:17] <lord_sykos> He could only block with 5, you had 6 so at least one would get through
[3:44:17] <crimsonsaens> If you attacked all out you would've won
[3:44:20] <%cylish> 6v5
[3:44:20] <+KevinsLunchbox> "I don't understand"
[3:44:22] <MyNameIsRasus> One of his guys couldn't block, so if you attacked with everyone, you would've had 6 attackers, and him, 5 defenders
[3:44:22] <%kouhi12> the scout gave him time to summon @PatStaresAt
[3:44:23] <vaderxyz1970> Im so dissapointed
[3:44:24] <$Afterman_> when you had commander you could have just used all your cards to kill him
[3:44:25] <+R_BChe> it was 6 attacker against 5 blockers, but u let scout die so 5v5
[3:44:26] <Venchair> one of his creatures had the couldn't block keyword
[3:44:27] <Kalcom> 5 to 6 units into 5 to 5
[3:44:27] <@SoFarFetched> Someone just needs to explain the ENTIRE process of what happened.
[3:44:28] <reonome> you outnumbered his blockers
[3:44:28] <+malacante> if you hadn't scouted you would have had more attackers at once and you would have gotten through for the last 2 damage
[3:44:30] <+AceVenturaPhD> scout got killed, allowed him another turn to summlon, now the units were even
[3:44:31] <reddpop_> This chat is awful today
[3:44:31] <Spiritttz> but nobody said it
[3:44:32] <+azure22900> They had a unit that could not block
[3:44:32] <restingbones> If you attack with one unit, it can easily be blocked. if you attack with all units, he could block all but 1
[3:44:33] <NiktenKing> You ended up wasting lethal by losing your unit
[3:44:33] <%Ninestempest> it turned from a 6v5 to 5v5
[3:44:33] <Yukasmarvin> @afterman_ Really? lol. solid reason I suppose
[3:44:33] <%kp539000> @arsonisthawk23 fuck made me laugh xD
[3:44:35] <scrublord009> 6 attackers of yours, 5 blockers. killing the scout makes it 5v5
[3:44:37] <enby_shout> this prob has been answered 1000 times but how does broken ac mean no cam
[3:44:38] <TyrantBelial> HE HAD 5 UNITS, YOU HAD 6.
[3:44:39] <%Bluwizard21> if they have a swain im playing him exclusively
[3:44:39] <Venchair> it can't
[3:44:40] <lord_sykos> Scout is only worth it when the scout when they can live
[3:44:40] <$galaxyswirl> NO HE COULDNT HAVE
[3:44:42] <+R_BChe> NOT IF U ATTACK
[3:44:42] <+AceVenturaPhD> nah
[3:44:43] <%Nekros4442> NO HE CANT
[3:44:43] <crimsonsaens> No he can't
[3:44:43] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt you can't attack with a scout for advantage when he has a blocker that will KILL THE SCOUT.
[3:44:44] <reonome> HE COULDN'T
[3:44:44] <%Ninestempest> NO CAUS EYOUC ANNOT SUMMON WHEN ATTACKING??
[3:44:44] <BlackermanZX> HE COULDNT
[3:44:44] <+klassikFrank> NOT IF YOU ATTACK
[3:44:44] <lord_sykos> No his board was full
[3:44:45] <%hzealot> no he can't
[3:44:45] <Saturdaythe14th> He can't summon a guy if you're attacking.
[3:44:45] <Venchair> he can't summon during attack phase
[3:44:46] <+Limp_Handshake> there are no cards from his deck that would have saved him
[3:44:46] <%bevyrage> you can't summon during an attack pat
[3:44:46] <$Afterman_> he wouldnt have a chance to summon
[3:44:48] <$galaxyswirl> U WOULD HAVE WON INSTANTLY
[3:44:48] <+malacante> you can't summon in response to attacks
[3:44:48] <mar_krow> no one cant block pat
[3:44:49] <LordWaldemaart> NO
[3:44:49] <Kalcom> can't summon when attacking
[3:44:50] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt he can't summon guys if you attack
[3:44:50] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt NO BECAUSE HE CAN'T SUMMON IF YOU ATTACK REMEMBER
[3:44:51] <%kouhi12> he can't summon when you attack @PatStaresAt
[3:44:51] <%R3Roundabout> I though he had played this game before, why is playing like a toddler is a tide pool
[3:44:51] <%SvenHolgersson> If you attacked you would have won
[3:44:52] <%Ninestempest> YOU LITRALLY JSUT LEARNED IF YOU ATTACK THEY CANNOT SUMMON
[3:44:52] <Spiritttz> cant summon mid combat
[3:44:52] <j0ustar> If you attck he can't summon
[3:44:53] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt Scout Attack -> Scout Dies -> He is Allowed to Summon = +2 advantage for him
[3:44:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Not when you declared an attack
[3:44:53] <%kp539000> no because you attacked before he had priority to summon
[3:44:54] <%cylish> not if you attack remember
[3:44:55] <%kp539000> remember
[3:44:56] <scrublord009> no he couldnt
[3:44:56] <reonome> HE CAN'T SUMMON WHEN YOU COMMIT AN ATTACK
[3:44:58] <SataruYamate> you lost your sixth dude because you scouted
[3:44:58] <flyingtentaclemonster> cause it Llowed the enemy to remove your attacker and play a new blocker
[3:44:58] <crimsonsaens> He couldn't summon at burst speed
[3:44:59] <%trustycoyote> Can't summon during blocking phase @PatStaresAt
[3:45:01] <%cylish> cant summon during an attack
[3:45:01] <+condor_fiend> if you attacked with all he could not have blocked them all it happens man your just starting
[3:45:01] <%SvenHolgersson> They cant ssummon if you attack
[3:45:02] <viewtifulr> cant summon if attacked we've been over this and i learned from chat
[3:45:02] <%JonathLP> You can't summon during an attack you learned this early
[3:45:02] <lord_sykos> Once attack is decleared you cant summon units
[3:45:02] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt He CANNOT summon units, while you are attacking.
[3:45:05] <awildgooseappears> basically since he had a card that coulndt defend, attavking with all minions would have at least one card hit the nexus
[3:45:05] <mar_krow> UNDYING CANT BLOCK
[3:45:05] <%arancet> cause they had 5 blockers to your 6 attackers, but using scout, they could kill it, then summon another blocker, so both sides had 5
[3:45:06] <%Nekros4442> You literally just learned you can't summon while attacking
[3:45:07] <+klassikFrank> If you attacked, it would've started the battle phase and he wouldn't be able to summon
[3:45:07] <%kp539000> you had this epiphany already
[3:45:10] <+AceVenturaPhD> bruh
[3:45:13] <restingbones> Pat we went over this
[3:45:13] <NiktenKing> They can't respond during attacking. You let him summon agin
[3:45:14] <%hzealot> @patstaresat you're paiging it pretty hard rn
[3:45:14] <%R3Roundabout> NO SHIT
[3:45:16] <+klassikFrank> You just learned this
[3:45:16] <iosephe> yarly
[3:45:16] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt yes he cant summon if you attack at beginning of phase
[3:45:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Lesson learned
[3:45:17] <%kp539000> "this changes everything"
[3:45:17] <reonome> you litreally had this tutorial LUL
[3:45:17] <%bevyrage> you learned this like what, 30 minutes ago?
[3:45:18] <%Nekros4442> You just had this epiphany already
[3:45:18] <$galaxyswirl> U LITTERLY JUST LEARNED THAT
[3:45:18] <LordWaldemaart> How would ve summon into a attack?????
[3:45:18] <Saturdaythe14th> You freaked out about this 10 minutes ago with elise, remember
[3:45:19] <%R3Roundabout> REALLY
[3:45:19] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that's how the game works
[3:45:19] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt remember, that's why it was good to attack with elise at the start of turn
[3:45:19] <%Ninestempest> YES THIS IS WHY YOU CAN JUST OPEN ATTACK WHEN YOU GET SWORD AND THEY CANNOT PLAY STUFF
[3:45:19] <%Quigsies> Sun is down
[3:45:20] <casualcthulhu11> he can only play spells
[3:45:21] <%ChrisPlaysThing> dude you just did that to ther people LUL
[3:45:21] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt you learned this over and hour ago
[3:45:22] <+marlborored5> you just learned this @PatStaresAt
[3:45:24] <MyNameIsRasus> GG, next
[3:45:27] <%kp539000> nope
[3:45:28] <%Nordguy> baba....
[3:45:29] <+Beefjavelin> pats refusal to just play MTG is amazing
[3:45:29] <SGrim> an
[3:45:30] <reonome> NO
[3:45:30] <crimsonsaens> no
[3:45:30] <Kalcom> ???
[3:45:30] <+skylerpilot> no
[3:45:31] <%R3Roundabout> I WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN
[3:45:31] <$galaxyswirl> ...
[3:45:32] <%SvenHolgersson> NOOOOOO
[3:45:32] <MoonlightP> it's honestly fine. card games are hard
[3:45:32] <MyNameIsRasus> No, that's for everyone
[3:45:32] <+EndgameContent> Think of summoning as casting a Slow spell
[3:45:33] <+R_BChe> no thats for all attacking
[3:45:34] <%djblue_shift> SOMEONE GET SAJAM IN HERE LOL
[3:45:34] <%Ninestempest> YOU LITERALLY LEARNED THIS LIKE 30 MINUTES AGO
[3:45:35] <%kp539000> yes
[3:45:35] <+marlborored5> everybody
[3:45:35] <%JonathLP> Pat you literally learned that earlier and said it out loud like an ephaniny
[3:45:35] <awildgooseappears> but you can after
[3:45:36] <lord_sykos> No scouts just get an extra attack phase
[3:45:37] <NiktenKing> You essentially gave him an extra response
[3:45:37] <iosephe> That's for everyone
[3:45:37] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt Scouts are allowed TWO BATTLE PHASES
[3:45:37] <reonome> NotLikeThis
[3:45:38] <Saturdaythe14th> Elise attacked and it was the same way
[3:45:38] <%SvenHolgersson> Scout gets 2 attacks basically
[3:45:38] <flyingtentaclemonster> You said it, "one of you will get trough"
[3:45:38] <crimsonsaens> It's for everybody
[3:45:38] <+skylerpilot> any attacking phase
[3:45:38] <%Fooguwu> but baba.....
[3:45:42] <$galaxyswirl> BABA
[3:45:44] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin mtg digital sucks
[3:45:44] <+skylerpilot> you can't play slow spells or summon
[3:45:45] <%R3Roundabout> WHAT A SURPRISE
[3:45:46] <%Mendin> but wall
[3:45:46] <restingbones> No, a Scout attack counts as a regular attack. It just give you an additional one.
[3:45:46] <$Afterman_> its ok Pat, this shit takes time to comprehend. Its like DOTA, you need 3 phds
[3:45:46] <+malacante> No when you're attacking the opponent can only cast fast or burst spells
[3:45:47] <%Chimeraelite> Why would you make such a broad assumption
[3:45:49] <%SvenHolgersson> But you have to attack with JUST scouts
[3:45:49] <+AceVenturaPhD> sun is down, freezing cold
[3:45:50] <%Taisuru> I believe in you pat
[3:45:51] <+azure22900> There are spells that can summon but its rare.
[3:45:51] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt they are allowed a Scout Attack phase where ONLY SCOUTS are allowed to attack
[3:45:51] <@SoFarFetched> @Beefjavelin he'd probably have more trouble now with mutate being a thing currently LUL
[3:45:52] <%Ninestempest> YOU LITERALLY SAID "ONE OF YOU WILL GET THROUGH" THEN DIDN'T DO IT'
[3:45:53] <DrStinkers> attacking is Fast speed
[3:45:53] <%GohanHitsugaya> BABA IS
[3:45:54] <Kalcom> stop pretending
[3:45:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Scouts give you one more attack, that's all
[3:46:01] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Started my first ranked match to a surrender LUL
[3:46:01] <j0ustar> DSPat going strong tonight hoo boi
[3:46:04] <flyingtentaclemonster> yeah, just in general
[3:46:08] <Jetsfantasy> No, that's just a general rule
[3:46:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> at draw
[3:46:09] <Venchair> the spells that can summon at instant still can't block
[3:46:11] <reonome> scouts only give you one more attack phase
[3:46:13] <Venchair> not with a full board
[3:46:13] <%hzealot> @sofarfetched pls I don't want to think of ikorua
[3:46:15] <Venchair> they'd fizzle
[3:46:16] <iosephe> It's fine you'll learn how card games work soon enough
[3:46:17] <+the_krypto_knight> drop your shield Pat
[3:46:18] <+Beefjavelin> @SGrim and is yet still the best digital card game. the rest are dumbed down gimmick crap
[3:46:25] <+malacante> nice opener
[3:46:26] <MyNameIsRasus> You'll learn
[3:46:26] <T_Sasquatch> It's day one guys. Give him time
[3:46:26] <+Snektor> oh man elmo is back for another stream...nice. Also sorry for the luck with the broken ac my dude
[3:46:27] <+KevinsLunchbox> you LITERALLY said "one of you will get through" and then didnt do it. you had victory and threw it away
[3:46:29] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin it's really not
[3:46:31] <Venchair> decent curve
[3:46:32] <$galaxyswirl> @iosephe sure?
[3:46:33] <MoonlightP> good curve
[3:46:33] <MyNameIsRasus> Remember chat, he's learning
[3:46:33] <arsonisthawk23> We all fail flash from time to time, so how about we put it behind us and lets gear up to watch this next train wreck
[3:46:35] <zamzoph> an actual curve PogChamp
[3:46:36] <mar_krow> pat doing fine
[3:46:36] <%Nameloc1667> That's a good hand
[3:46:38] <%Nameloc1667> Nice
[3:46:45] <$galaxyswirl> YOOOOO A CURVE
[3:46:45] <flyingtentaclemonster> Its ok Pat, new game will take a few ganes to get used to, dont let chat get you down
[3:46:45] <awildgooseappears> actual optimal hand
[3:46:49] <viewtifulr> alright new game, new pat
[3:46:54] <%hzealot> pat not doing fine don't lie lmao
[3:46:54] <+Beefjavelin> @SGrim name one that has better mechanics
[3:46:58] <Venchair> swing
[3:46:59] <NiktenKing> Scout give you an extra Scout Exclusive attack phase, but in doing so, you essentially give the enemy another response phase
[3:47:02] <Gamer76255> Seems Pat was pressured into playing the Riot game
[3:47:03] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt attack right away now and he can't summon
[3:47:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Good
[3:47:08] <scrublord009> open attack
[3:47:11] <MoonlightP> man ruination would've come in handy last game lmao
[3:47:13] <Saturdaythe14th> pressured himself to want to play a video game
[3:47:14] <Venchair> he can't summon
[3:47:16] <dinnydanny777> Can't you min max your deck so that you only get the cards you want?
[3:47:17] <Venchair> he doesn't have priority
[3:47:18] <zedravan> he can't
[3:47:18] <MyNameIsRasus> He can't summon
[3:47:18] <reonome> HE CAN'T SUMMON
[3:47:18] <%Ninestempest> WHEN YOU ATTACK HE CANNOT
[3:47:19] <+notcyrus> pat's been a youtuber/streamer for like more than 10 years, he's not gonna let chat stop him from playing
[3:47:20] <awildgooseappears> he cant summon now
[3:47:20] <+Brighthawk> whatever the rules are they look confusing
[3:47:20] <%R3Roundabout> This has to be a bit. There is no way he could have the game played for him by chat and not be able to win. He's laughing while we anguish over him putting the circle in the square hole for the 50th time.
[3:47:22] <%Nekros4442> HE CANT SUMMON
[3:47:22] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin the game pat's presently playing if you know how to play it, for starters.
[3:47:26] <+PharosOfLight> Just got here. Is this an expedition or a premade deck?
[3:47:26] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt in blocking phase you can only use spells
[3:47:27] <$galaxyswirl> HE CANT, HE CAN ONLY PLAY SPELL
[3:47:29] <%Ninestempest> NICE
[3:47:33] <iosephe> Nice!
[3:47:33] <MyNameIsRasus> He can use quick and burst spells though
[3:47:34] <zamzoph> good play PogChamp
[3:47:36] <LordWaldemaart> YOU ATTACK BEFORE HE CAN DO ANYTHING
[3:47:37] <+klassikFrank> GOOD PLAY
[3:47:38] <%ArcanumMBD> When someone attacks, you can only react with spells or assigning blockers. You can't react with a summon
[3:47:39] <+R_BChe> good play PogChamp
[3:47:39] <MyNameIsRasus> GOOD PLAY
[3:47:39] <$Zalthia> Poro!
[3:47:40] <awildgooseappears> ohhh yess
[3:47:41] <mar_krow> ppl like to save early to get spell slots
[3:47:42] <$galaxyswirl> GOOD
[3:47:42] <+Snektor> but he killed the thing :)
[3:47:47] <+malacante> YOU can't kill my guys only I get to kill my guys
[3:47:47] <viewtifulr> out played aeroPog
[3:47:47] <NiktenKing> Nice
[3:47:49] <arsonisthawk23> CONGLATURATIONS
[3:47:49] <%JonathLP> Nice play Pat
[3:47:50] <scrublord009> NOW WE ARE PODRACING
[3:47:51] <+preppyposs> is that ghost shark
[3:47:53] <Venchair> shark can't block
[3:47:53] <NiktenKing> Outsmarted
[3:47:56] <+Beefjavelin> @sgrim its just a slightly better HS. No other game comes close to the depth of MTG digital or not
[3:47:57] <+EndgameContent> Why would he waste Mystic on that?
[3:47:57] <reonome> PogChamp
[3:47:58] <%Nameloc1667> Coral bro
[3:47:59] <%SvenHolgersson> shark op
[3:47:59] <%TheQButton> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaDown
[3:48:00] <+R_BChe> coral
[3:48:02] <zamzoph> shark sucks
[3:48:04] <Saturdaythe14th> can we even use shark for anything
[3:48:05] <awildgooseappears> donnnt
[3:48:06] <MoonlightP> drop coral
[3:48:07] <+R_BChe> shark for attacking
[3:48:10] <MyNameIsRasus> THe little dude
[3:48:11] <Saturdaythe14th> we have the sapling lady I guess
[3:48:13] <MyNameIsRasus> In the left
[3:48:13] <%Nameloc1667> Use Coral, shark next turn
[3:48:16] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin what you call depth, I call bloat.
[3:48:17] <crimsonsaens> Play Coral
[3:48:17] <arsonisthawk23> baby shark do do dodoooo
[3:48:20] <Saturdaythe14th> but yeah oral now
[3:48:21] <%SvenHolgersson> coral then block
[3:48:26] <MoonlightP> shark has light synergy with the saplings
[3:48:26] <Venchair> Ohhhh
[3:48:28] <Venchair> that's a solid pull
[3:48:30] <+R_BChe> wow
[3:48:30] <+Beefjavelin> @SGrim maybe you're just garbage at magic?
[3:48:31] <MyNameIsRasus> YEYEYE
[3:48:32] <Lutre> EZ
[3:48:33] <MoonlightP> and i guess mark of the isles now
[3:48:38] <+mikesapartment> where is the ginger cam? is this a sponsored stream?
[3:48:38] <%kp539000> @PatStaresAt When you attack, your opponent is locked into only responsive actions, like fast and burst spells, you can't use slow spells or summon allies when a player is attacking
[3:48:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Block and use the splee
[3:48:40] <+R_BChe> kill that ho
[3:48:44] <$galaxyswirl> USE THE +2/+2
[3:48:47] <%Nameloc1667> Pass
[3:48:48] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt hey pat, just to let you know cinders updated again, now at version 1.75
[3:48:51] <LordWaldemaart> Block and sacrifice
[3:48:51] <mar_krow> no need to be mean
[3:48:52] <crimsonsaens> I'd just block
[3:48:53] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin that would be a solid argument if Magic required skill.
[3:48:55] <Saturdaythe14th> we could just pass and have TF gold card her next turn instead, but this works fine
[3:48:55] <MyNameIsRasus> NICE
[3:48:56] <+R_BChe> nice
[3:49:02] <%SvenHolgersson> NOW WERE USING OUT BRAIN MEAT
[3:49:06] <+Beefjavelin> @sgrim ok now i know you're definitely garbage at magic
[3:49:11] <MoonlightP> nice rekindler too
[3:49:11] <+R_BChe> shark
[3:49:12] <crimsonsaens> TF Blue
[3:49:12] <MyNameIsRasus> STREET SHARKS
[3:49:15] <MoonlightP> good safety net for TF
[3:49:15] <NiktenKing> Big brain strats
[3:49:15] <zamzoph> brood next turnshark
[3:49:18] <lodwilk> SHARK
[3:49:18] <+malacante> you can tf blue card
[3:49:29] <Saturdaythe14th> might as well use the shark now in case we can do something later, it's fine
[3:49:33] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin again, it's hard to be bad at a game that's just build a better deck.
[3:49:38] <zamzoph> just attack
[3:49:44] <MoonlightP> yeah nothing to do but attack
[3:49:44] <SpookySpaghooti> shark attack
[3:49:47] <Venchair> shark dies at end of turn anyway
[3:49:50] <+R_BChe> and save ur mana for brood next
[3:49:57] <NiktenKing> Use it or lose it
[3:49:59] <%Broand> this'll bit
[3:50:08] <LoneFonte> shark
[3:50:12] <zamzoph> baby shark
[3:50:14] <+Beefjavelin> @sgrim every card game can be described as "build a better deck". Except when two people both have good decks, thats when you need to actually use your big brain
[3:50:15] <Saturdaythe14th> not just shark, a chariot pulled by flying ghost sharks.
[3:50:17] <NiktenKing> Fambly
[3:50:18] <SpookySpaghooti> s h a r k
[3:50:21] <MoonlightP> if you summon saplings later then it'll come back
[3:50:36] <MoonlightP> at least on attack
[3:50:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Definetly brood
[3:50:53] <Saturdaythe14th> wow that new voice line is so much worse
[3:50:53] <$galaxyswirl> YEYEYE
[3:50:54] <zamzoph> good play from him LUL
[3:50:54] <Kalcom> unno, brood?
[3:50:57] <Saturdaythe14th> she sounds so bored
[3:50:58] <+R_BChe> ye
[3:51:01] <crimsonsaens> yeah
[3:51:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Best play you could make
[3:51:11] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin two people having good decks in magic requires even less thought that hearthstone. Just play the default card sequence you're decks based on and hope you don't bog yourself down.
[3:51:12] <zamzoph> @Saturdaythe14th old voice was a lot better FeelsBadMan
[3:51:20] <SGrim> than*
[3:51:21] <Venchair> Could block all 3 and red card later
[3:51:26] <SGrim> your*
[3:51:37] <Saturdaythe14th> what the flying fuck are you talking about by the way
[3:51:37] <SGrim> I'm bad at spelling woopsAh
[3:51:42] <MoonlightP> he'll do it for you
[3:51:43] <mar_krow> he does have grasp for next turn if he takes damage
[3:51:46] <Saturdaythe14th> magic requires less thought than hearthstone? huh?
[3:51:47] <Kalcom> destroy
[3:51:52] <flyingtentaclemonster> Pat honestly stop checking for chat's validation, you have to naje horrible mistakes to learn how this game works
[3:51:52] <Venchair> don't glimpse
[3:51:52] <%Ninestempest> yeah use glimpse
[3:51:55] <%Ninestempest> okay
[3:51:55] <+R_BChe> just let it happen, and tf red card
[3:51:58] <LordWaldemaart> no
[3:51:58] <%TheQButton> It's weird to see board clears cost so much mana after playing hearthstone for so long.
[3:51:59] <Zetheos> yo we runein' terras in here boys
[3:52:05] <+Beefjavelin> @sgrim my dude, can we stop pretending you understand magic. You super clearly dont know what you're talking about
[3:52:11] <MyNameIsRasus> Tank her attack, TF red card
[3:52:12] <Kalcom> both worked
[3:52:23] <+R_BChe> yis
[3:52:23] <Saturdaythe14th> this is fine yeah
[3:52:31] <Louie_Salmon> @theqbutton It's balanced around spell mana, which is mainly a mechanic for control decks, so that makes sense
[3:52:35] <+Beefjavelin> @sgrim like, maybe you played 5 hours of arena and assume you know the game. It's obviously not the case
[3:52:36] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin that's a weird way to say your out of points to argue.
[3:52:38] <%DEETRz> for my ffxiv friends the Formidable fate is up on Behemoth
[3:52:40] <awildgooseappears> Hey pat, if this could be of help, during an attack phase ,the defending player has as options only to do fast and burst spells , meanwhile summoning and slow spells can be played right after the attack phase or after a spell or summon from the oposing player.
[3:52:42] <+R_BChe> now tf dese hoes
[3:52:42] <Zetheos> tap a spider for four black
[3:52:44] <Saturdaythe14th> elise first
[3:52:46] <SGrim> you're*
[3:52:48] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt just beat all of ds3 cinders. Miracles are amazing now especially a certain corona firing rod and any lightning skills but the spears
[3:52:49] <Partrap> now you can block and kill the 3 power 1
[3:52:49] <Saturdaythe14th> so tf hits something else with red card
[3:52:52] <Venchair> elise first
[3:52:54] <nechronia> Elise then TF
[3:52:57] <$galaxyswirl> elise first
[3:52:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SGrim As someone who fucked a very serious player, youre so wrong lol
[3:53:01] <%SvenHolgersson> elise first just in case he has removal
[3:53:02] <Venchair> so your red card will hit if he summons anything else
[3:53:06] <%hzealot> @beefjavelin if anyone in here gonna talk magic its me who's actually been to high comp play and knows judge rules
[3:53:13] <star87if> why is elmo covering the screen guys?
[3:53:14] <Louie_Salmon> Slow spells and minions can't be played during combat or while anything is on the stack
[3:53:24] <reonome> oh no the mtg arguments have started
[3:53:26] <zamzoph> @star87if Pat nekkid
[3:53:27] <+R_BChe> perfect
[3:53:28] <%TheQButton> @Louie_Salmon yeah that makes sense but seeing it in practice feels really foreign for some reason.
[3:53:30] <Venchair> perfect
[3:53:30] <BlackermanZX> perfect
[3:53:32] <+PharosOfLight> red caaaard
[3:53:33] <zamzoph> PERFECT
[3:53:33] <porygonftw> GG
[3:53:34] <zedravan> F
[3:53:38] <mar_krow> u know its just started
[3:53:38] <SGrim> @XeroSigmaPrime fucked them in cards or bed? You've got my curiosity.
[3:53:39] <Saturdaythe14th> well this guy got destroyed
[3:53:40] <%SvenHolgersson> LEARNDING
[3:53:41] <NiktenKing> Perfect
[3:53:42] <LordWaldemaart> hah get f ed nerd
[3:53:42] <reonome> GOTEM
[3:53:43] <+Beefjavelin> @hzealot so you can help confirm this guy is obviously clueless?
[3:53:48] <+R_BChe> pass
[3:53:51] <star87if> nooo Xo
[3:53:51] <reonome> ATTACK
[3:53:51] <Louie_Salmon> Massive value
[3:53:51] <%SvenHolgersson> That scout guy is still bs though
[3:53:52] <$galaxyswirl> pass
[3:53:55] <+Beefjavelin> @hzealot can i get a judge ruling on that
[3:53:55] <Saturdaythe14th> we got more cards than him so we can pass
[3:53:55] <DrStinkers> ye be wanred
[3:53:57] <+PharosOfLight> TF: "I'm gonna ruin this guy's whole career"
[3:54:03] <Saturdaythe14th> and now we have ledros, so he just grind him out
[3:54:10] <+HyTricksy> ledros! gg
[3:54:11] <T_Sasquatch> Nerds fighting about card gamez LUL
[3:54:18] <%hzealot> @beefjavelin so there are decks where you do the same thing everytime but he is oversimplifying
[3:54:22] <Zetheos> on a video game stream
[3:54:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @hzealot So tell us, whos wrong? Pretty sure its @SGrim who is over simplifiying the game
[3:54:24] <MoonlightP> you can play kinda loose with your champs with rekindler in your hand
[3:54:29] <Saturdaythe14th> We can just stall until we win probably
[3:54:30] <Venchair> There's a free emote and Guardian in the shop right now if you're interested it's a rainbow variant of the one you have
[3:54:37] <%ArcanumMBD> if he attacks you can Drain and then block with spider
[3:54:43] <porygonftw> draw?
[3:54:44] <+Beefjavelin> @hzealot my dude i've played MTG for like ten years you dont need to explain how decks play to me
[3:54:45] <MoonlightP> man this guy seems rip unless pat fucks up immensely
[3:54:46] <awildgooseappears> you could level up tf really fast with your hand
[3:54:46] <Louie_Salmon> Stall is almost always better than just throwing units away
[3:54:52] <%hzealot> like 8 rack you do the same thing
[3:54:54] <Saturdaythe14th> we can salvage if you want, or just wait
[3:54:56] <crimsonsaens> Salvage
[3:54:56] <DeliciousOrangeArt> why not salvage?
[3:54:57] <+R_BChe> salvage?
[3:55:00] <Samaugsch2> Pat looks different today. Did he get a haircut?
[3:55:00] <VirtuaRailith> pat has card advantage
[3:55:00] <iosephe> Salvage!
[3:55:01] <VirtuaRailith> he's fine
[3:55:02] <%hzealot> @beefjavelin I'm agreeing with you my guy
[3:55:05] <Saturdaythe14th> waiting is fine too
[3:55:09] <Venchair> you could grasp and ye been warned bear
[3:55:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SGrim Sex, pegged him out of his mind. Anyway MTG is more complicated
[3:55:09] <+Beefjavelin> @hzealot <3
[3:55:11] <iosephe> always draw cards
[3:55:12] <scrublord009> He needs grasp mana dummies
[3:55:13] <%Ninestempest> could salvage so you don't lose a smuch mana
[3:55:13] <Venchair> and then pull him with tf
[3:55:15] <+the_krypto_knight> MTG is fun but its not some holy ultra game that invalidates all other games
[3:55:18] <zamzoph> pass
[3:55:18] <crimsonsaens> now pass
[3:55:23] <$galaxyswirl> pass
[3:55:24] <%SvenHolgersson> JUCIY BOI
[3:55:24] <iosephe> Now pas
[3:55:25] <iosephe> s
[3:55:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Beefjavelin LOL @hzealot is agreeing with us dude
[3:55:27] <+malacante> No reason not to salvage
[3:55:28] <MoonlightP> you can pass now
[3:55:32] <+PharosOfLight> fyi pat, drawing from your opponents deck also counts for TF
[3:55:33] <SGrim> @XeroSigmaPrime again, what beef and you call complexity, I call bloat.
[3:55:37] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt he has no units in hand
[3:55:38] <+BeezusHrist> What does the A/C have to do with you not being on camera? I want to see hot and sweaty pat nathanPepe @PatStaresAt
[3:55:39] <Venchair> you can warned on the small guy and pull with tf
[3:55:44] <Venchair> oh wait
[3:55:48] <Venchair> no he's not on attack shit
[3:55:50] <mar_krow> now kiss and make up
[3:55:52] <Saturdaythe14th> we can tank the 3 it's fine
[3:55:53] <Venchair> I'm tired
[3:55:57] <zamzoph> black 4/4 and 2/2
[3:55:57] <+HyTricksy> grasp the 4/4 and block?
[3:56:02] <+R_BChe> kill squire and drain tiger
[3:56:02] <iosephe> Feels like a trick, you have the ability to deal with things though
[3:56:03] <%SvenHolgersson> block the tiger with spider then drain
[3:56:04] <%JonathLP> "What's he doing?" "He's learning." Pat: "I know Card-Fu."
[3:56:06] <awildgooseappears> dont block !!!
[3:56:07] <$galaxyswirl> drain one then block thay one
[3:56:10] <+marlborored5> grasp the 4/4 and block it with a spider
[3:56:15] <VirtuaRailith> elise blocks 2/2, block the 4/4 with a spider
[3:56:15] <$galaxyswirl> the 5 cost spell
[3:56:15] <crimsonsaens> Block 4/4 with spider and 2/2 with Elise
[3:56:19] <Louie_Salmon> Oh boy
[3:56:24] <%arancet> block tiger with spider, then drain the tiger
[3:56:25] <+Beefjavelin> @sgrim so your ideal card game is just like uno or snap?
[3:56:26] <Saturdaythe14th> ignore the bear and block the other guys, yeah
[3:56:27] <nepwar> thinking
[3:56:30] <Louie_Salmon> These instructions are too complicated and also all different
[3:56:31] <DeliciousOrangeArt> he can block-sac the spider for free draws
[3:56:35] <$galaxyswirl> NO
[3:56:37] <MyNameIsRasus> Drain the 2/2
[3:56:37] <%ArcanumMBD> Grasp the 4/4
[3:56:41] <Saturdaythe14th> yes this is fine
[3:56:42] <lord_sykos> keep the TF, drain the 4/4
[3:56:42] <%WheatlyXT> You could block with the 2/1 and Glimpse him. It would cause the attack to miss. But I don’t know if that’d be good
[3:56:42] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt grasp the 4/4
[3:56:43] <Partrap> you can just block everything then nuke the board
[3:56:43] <zamzoph> YES
[3:56:46] <Saturdaythe14th> damn it one guy
[3:56:46] <crimsonsaens> yes
[3:56:49] <LordWaldemaart> Grasp
[3:56:51] <crimsonsaens> Who?
[3:56:52] <mar_krow> vile bite
[3:56:53] <%ArcanumMBD> THE SPELL YOU JSUT USED
[3:56:55] <%SvenHolgersson> THE HAND
[3:56:55] <+b_bang_> grasp
[3:56:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SGrim Never called it complexity. IT honestly depends more on the deck strategy. Some are always the same and simple, other require alot of dynamic thinking and adjusting
[3:56:56] <Venchair> the green card is called grasp
[3:56:56] <DrStinkers> that card
[3:56:57] <reonome> the spell you used
[3:56:58] <%kp539000> literally the card u played
[3:56:58] <lord_sykos> Grasp is the spell
[3:56:58] <MyNameIsRasus> That's the card you just used
[3:57:02] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt the spell you just used is GRASP
[3:57:03] <awildgooseappears> the card you just playe
[3:57:03] <+R_BChe> the card u just played
[3:57:03] <nepwar> pat reads
[3:57:04] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt it's the skill you just used
[3:57:05] <crimsonsaens> The blocks were better
[3:57:06] <reonome> YOU USED IT ALREADY
[3:57:08] <+Saltima> the hand you just used, pat
[3:57:08] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU JUST PLAYED IT
[3:57:09] <MoonlightP> you just used it
[3:57:09] <CherrieVelvet> drain is grasp?
[3:57:09] <+BeezusHrist> How hot could it be in Canada?
[3:57:09] <BlackermanZX> literally the green card you just used LUL
[3:57:10] <Zetheos> yyou just cast it
[3:57:13] <SataruYamate> Grasp was the drain card @PatStaresAt
[3:57:14] <Saturdaythe14th> Pat had a god play ready to go and somebody shouts NOOOO
[3:57:16] <Venchair> use the tree on your spider
[3:57:17] <%WheatlyXT> Grasp is the name of the drain
[3:57:18] <%ArcanumMBD> Oh man you can hear the gears turning
[3:57:18] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt CLICK THE SCROLL ON LEFT SIDE OF SCREEN
[3:57:18] <%SvenHolgersson> ONE GUY RUINS EVERYTHING
[3:57:19] <VirtuaRailith> pat's weakness is 1 GUY
[3:57:20] <%kp539000> the green card called grasp of the undying
[3:57:22] <crimsonsaens> Caretaker on spider
[3:57:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SGrim ITs as "complex" or "deep" as you or your opponent make it
[3:57:23] <$galaxyswirl> ill takr the heat for that one, i didnt elaberate
[3:57:23] <+Saltima> how are you actively and inactively blind at the same fucking time!?
[3:57:24] <Venchair> and you can use saplings to get a free shark back
[3:57:27] <VirtuaRailith> the enemy stand of crazy talk
[3:57:37] <zamzoph> the Grasp drains
[3:57:39] <viewtifulr> PAT., im sorry but your hitting real goldfish hours of memory
[3:57:43] <%WheatlyXT> It was the card you just played Pat. The drain card’s name is Grasp of the Undying
[3:57:44] <Saturdaythe14th> caretaker the spider I guess
[3:57:44] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt kill the spider, get sapplings
[3:57:46] <Zetheos> just play mono red

[3:57:48] <crimsonsaens> Caretaker on Spider
[3:57:49] <%R3Roundabout> psa1guy
[3:57:52] <MoonlightP> if you kill the spider you'll summon the shark chariot along with the saplings
[3:57:54] <awildgooseappears> glimpse the spider
[3:58:02] <reonome> time to attack
[3:58:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Attack with saplings
[3:58:05] <SGrim> @Beefjavelin you seem to conflate complex rules with quality gaming. You asked originally which games have better mechanics than MTG. I consider MTG bloated, and as a result consider most card games better. rooShrug
[3:58:09] <%ArcanumMBD> attack with the saplings for free damage
[3:58:11] <%ArcanumMBD> gotta attack
[3:58:12] <Saturdaythe14th> shark comes out when you attack
[3:58:12] <Venchair> when you swing
[3:58:13] <%ArcanumMBD> for shark
[3:58:14] <%SvenHolgersson> when you attack
[3:58:14] <VirtuaRailith> it will when you attack
[3:58:14] <%WheatlyXT> Glimpse the spider for more options
[3:58:15] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt when you attack
[3:58:16] <MyNameIsRasus> When you attack
[3:58:16] <reonome> when you attack

[3:58:25] <NiktenKing> On attack phase
[3:58:26] <MoonlightP> it'll appear on the right of the field when you attack
[3:58:30] <+HyTricksy> when you attack before hitting ok
[3:58:38] <Venchair> oof
[3:58:39] <MyNameIsRasus> OOF
[3:58:39] <+R_BChe> oof
[3:58:40] <%kp539000> @SGrim your opinion i gues, but i can't say i agree calling depth and complexity 'bloat' lol
[3:58:43] <+HyTricksy> RIP
[3:58:44] <LordWaldemaart> Now attack and pull them to the saplings
[3:58:45] <DeliciousOrangeArt> now you sac for the draws

[3:58:59] <Venchair> how close is tf to leveling
[3:59:00] <Zetheos> "Most card games are better than MTG" is a pretty unpopular statement
[3:59:00] <+Limp_Handshake> no 1-2-3
[3:59:05] <%WheatlyXT> Glimpse one of em
[3:59:11] <+desfore> Trueshoot barrage pierces in LoL, so... yeah?

[3:59:16] <porygonftw> WTF
[3:59:16] <crimsonsaens> no
[3:59:17] <%ArcanumMBD> WHY
[3:59:17] <%SvenHolgersson> WAIT
[3:59:17] <iosephe> NO
[3:59:17] <Saturdaythe14th> well that's a weird idea
[3:59:18] <$galaxyswirl> ...
[3:59:19] <%SvenHolgersson> WHY
[3:59:19] <Louie_Salmon> ???
[3:59:20] <reonome> WHY????
[3:59:20] <rekinom> That picture of Elmo screams "I showed you my belly pls respond"
[3:59:21] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt next turn use rekindler
[3:59:22] <%ArcanumMBD> WHY DRAIN YOUR OWN UNIT
[3:59:23] <LordWaldemaart> ?????
[3:59:24] <keyworthe> ...
[3:59:25] <mar_krow> hold on
[3:59:27] <MoonlightP> that's fine
[3:59:27] <$galaxyswirl> YOU JUST KILLED ELISE FOR NOTHING
[3:59:28] <T_Sasquatch> Ummmm
[3:59:28] <+HyTricksy> didnt need to vile feast
[3:59:30] <MyNameIsRasus> GOOD PLAY
[3:59:33] <scrublord009> Can he level TF now
[3:59:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YU GI OH > MTG, change my mind
[3:59:33] <Saturdaythe14th> he'll learn calm down
[3:59:36] <%ArcanumMBD> you couldve dealt 1 free damage to the enemy
[3:59:38] <+pectusumbra> it's fine
[3:59:40] <%WheatlyXT> Oh
[3:59:41] <Louie_Salmon> But why drain it?
[3:59:41] <%s_xylocalsingles> CHAT SHUT UP ITS FINE
[3:59:42] <Calek> people are so mad
[3:59:42] <%ArcanumMBD> and gotten the spiderling
[3:59:43] <SGrim> @kp539000 I'd say MTG isn't complicated. It's just has decades worth of rules inflation. At it's core, the game's pretty straight forward.
[3:59:44] <reonome> just drain the enemy's unit instead???
[3:59:45] <crimsonsaens> attack with all
[3:59:45] <iosephe> Yesssssssss
[3:59:46] <Zetheos> @XeroSigmaPrime the cards are too small
[3:59:52] <Venchair> swing spider too
[3:59:54] <%bevyrage> it was an interesting play, not a bad one
[3:59:56] <zamzoph> attack with spider too
[3:59:57] <LordWaldemaart> Thats damage to the enemy and elise would have lived
[4:00:01] <%Ninestempest> it was an okay play
[4:00:02] <Venchair> spider would have been a free 1 damage
[4:00:04] <%DaBigVitus> this looks easy enough to follow. good first try for a non card gamer?
[4:00:07] <+EndgameContent> It would've made sense against an Ez deck
[4:00:07] <mar_krow> coulda done 1 damgae pat
[4:00:11] <%SvenHolgersson> its fine youll learn
[4:00:12] <+pectusumbra> it's okay
[4:00:12] <+EndgameContent> To deny him a flip
[4:00:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Zetheos fuck you right...
[4:00:15] <Kiraklene> Spoder
[4:00:16] <LordWaldemaart> Why not attack with the spooder?
[4:00:16] <Armthehobos> I hope they add mordekaiser
[4:00:18] <%TheQButton> WHOOOO SHARK!!!!
[4:00:20] <+EndgameContent> It's not a super consequential misplay though
[4:00:24] <Saturdaythe14th> It's a pretty good card game, just mildly complicated to learn
[4:00:24] <+HyTricksy> ledros time
[4:00:25] <porygonftw> blow up the board
[4:00:26] <zamzoph> RUINAATION
[4:00:26] <MoonlightP> ledros turn
[4:00:30] <Saturdaythe14th> ruination
[4:00:33] <VirtuaRailith> ruination
[4:00:33] <MoonlightP> actually wait yeah
[4:00:34] <crimsonsaens> Ruination
[4:00:34] <Saturdaythe14th> ledros is fine too
[4:00:34] <iosephe> Ruin this bitch
[4:00:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Ruination
[4:00:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Zetheos Fuck, you right* Put a cimportant comma in
[4:00:37] <LordWaldemaart> COMANDER
[4:00:37] <MoonlightP> ruination is great here
[4:00:38] <iosephe> Or that
[4:00:38] <Saturdaythe14th> but we can ruin soon
[4:00:40] <T_Sasquatch> @dabigvitus yes. Im a new card player, pretty straight forward
[4:00:42] <MyNameIsRasus> That's also fine
[4:00:42] <MoonlightP> eh
[4:00:44] <MoonlightP> either works
[4:00:45] <scrublord009> RUINATION LET'S GO
[4:00:46] <mar_krow> ruin nationb pat
[4:00:47] <+arcturusblade> opponent's hand's almost empty btw
[4:00:49] <%bevyrage> ledros into ruination is a good 1-2
[4:00:50] <+desfore> I... don't understand what's happening
[4:00:52] <Zetheos> @XeroSigmaPrime my biggest complaint about YuGiOh is that I can't put my Magic cards with their sleeves : (
[4:00:54] <%kp539000> @SGrim but.... that's the point xD the sheer amount of rules etc makes it complicated, all the card games are pretty basic at rules level, but once u add more and more card interactions, the depth grows
[4:00:56] <+PharosOfLight> you can still safely ruination next turn too if needed, ledros cares not
[4:00:58] <Partrap> lets just try that again
[4:01:02] <MoonlightP> because ledros will hop back to hand after ledros drops
[4:01:03] <%ArcanumMBD> Yeah he's out of creatures so Ruination will stall him out completely
[4:01:06] <porygonftw> ouch
[4:01:10] <+KilogramHours> Wait why does the enemy has three different regions?
[4:01:10] <Zetheos> @XeroSigmaPrime pretend that had better grammar
[4:01:11] <zamzoph> F
[4:01:12] <Saturdaythe14th> wow he actually had a counter
[4:01:13] <Venchair> geeze
[4:01:14] <Saturdaythe14th> it's still fine though

[4:01:16] <+HyTricksy> holy shit ok bye
[4:01:16] <DeliciousOrangeArt> wrecked lol
[4:01:16] <+KilogramHours> Oh is this expeditions?
[4:01:18] <Venchair> block the high damage
[4:01:18] <MoonlightP> shit that was really solid
[4:01:18] <iosephe> ow, but you're still ahead
[4:01:19] <mar_krow> block
[4:01:19] <+EndgameContent> SMART
[4:01:20] <crimsonsaens> wow, really?
[4:01:21] <BlackermanZX> wow
[4:01:21] <%bevyrage> chump them big hits
[4:01:25] <%Ninestempest> YOU HAVE NO ALIBI
[4:01:25] <SGrim> @kp539000 again, that's not depth. That's bloat.
[4:01:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Block the 4
[4:01:26] <LordWaldemaart> Block
[4:01:28] <SpookySpaghooti> what the fuck card was that

[4:01:36] <MoonlightP> just ruination next turn
[4:01:37] <VirtuaRailith> just ruin next turn
[4:01:39] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah I could not read that card fast enough
[4:01:39] <+Kawaso> what just happened?
[4:01:39] <+Limp_Handshake> free ruination now
[4:01:39] <%bevyrage> NOW it is time for the ruination
[4:01:40] <rexverminus> got em, this one's in the bag
[4:01:40] <mar_krow> no
[4:01:41] <DeliciousOrangeArt> Fuzzy Slippers is doing their best
[4:01:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Zetheos I cant, already sliced my eyes open at such a statement

[4:01:52] <Louie_Salmon> No?
[4:01:52] <LoneFonte> nah
[4:01:53] <mar_krow> no
[4:01:53] <%Ninestempest> that's only if you're attacking
[4:01:54] <Venchair> it only works the same turn it's played
[4:01:54] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt RUINATION NEXT TURN
[4:01:55] <Saturdaythe14th> use it first next turn
[4:01:55] <NiktenKing> He has no cards

[4:01:59] <LordWaldemaart> no
[4:02:00] <Saturdaythe14th> to bait him into playing a dude

[4:02:10] <Zetheos> @XeroSigmaPrime I feel like that may be an overreaction, but at least you got that braille plugin working
[4:02:11] <%WheatlyXT> No

[4:05:30] <MyNameIsRasus> We're sorry
[4:05:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat, this is what streaming a card game is: CONSTANT BACKSEATING
[4:05:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Just play less garbage and more better
[4:05:32] <%TheQButton> psaPorgmo_FC psaPorgmo_FC psaPorgmo_FC psaPorgmo_FC

[4:05:35] <Venchair> warned for glimpse
[4:05:36] <iosephe> Card games are stressful!
[4:05:37] <pelonsinvalle> MORE RIOT
[4:05:38] <viewtifulr> that one guy really did it
[4:05:39] <flyingtentaclemonster> Yeah, you should stop looking at chat for advice mid match
[4:05:39] <Armthehobos> Gg
[4:05:41] <%Mendin> 4
[4:05:41] <porygonftw> glipse
[4:05:42] <+pectusumbra> what is slotbot?
[4:05:42] <MoonlightP> keep everything
[4:05:44] <viewtifulr> he saved videogames
[4:05:45] <sendart> twitch plays Runterra
[4:05:46] <SilentEric> Yeah that is a good trade
[4:05:51] <Venchair> slotbot is a big gimmick card
[4:05:52] <NiktenKing> When you learn the cards, just mute us out
[4:05:52] <Louie_Salmon> That's a lot of glimpse
[4:05:54] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Hope youll play this some more on your own. I think youll learn a lot on your own without chat judgin and "guiding"
[4:05:54] <Saturdaythe14th> slotbot is a bad card, that's what slotbot is
[4:05:55] <mar_krow> pats doing fine
[4:05:55] <%Mendin> Pat now you have FOUR Glimpse Beyonds
[4:05:56] <TyrantBelial> it's a Card Game, they're emant to be stressful, how dare you have fun.
[4:05:59] <rexverminus> Card Game Backseating is like, a major reason not to stream a card game
[4:05:59] <%kp539000> slow mode migh thelp
[4:06:00] <nechronia> It's a ton of people giving advice and a 4th of them are wrong
[4:06:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> 5 MORE HOURS
[4:06:02] <DrStinkers> @PatStaresAt get that chat clicks on the screen tech in here
[4:06:02] <SilentEric> mogwaiGod mogwaiGod
[4:06:02] <hekethe> good trade Pat
[4:06:05] <+PharosOfLight> As long as you're having fun
[4:06:10] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Slotbot is a FUN card I think you mean
[4:06:11] <TheArrow_> chat is pretty intense right now tbh
[4:06:16] <MoonlightP> always keep champs
[4:06:17] <Louie_Salmon> That seems alright
[4:06:19] <%bevyrage> not going to deny that chat is stressful, but the goblins in your head telling you to look at chat to not lose is likely causing just as much stress mang
[4:06:21] <SilentEric> Card game chat.
[4:06:26] <+HyTricksy> to be fair pat is asking us questions
[4:06:28] <Saturdaythe14th> I'd like to remind us he literally asked us to help him before he started the draft
[4:06:31] <%joylent_blue> card games are srs bsns
[4:06:31] <%Pappajimbo> to quote david mitchel "its less the blind leading the blind and more the blind blinding the sighted"
[4:06:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> God, card games get me FUCKING MOIST
[4:06:34] <SilentEric> Especially with a new player. The backseat gets full fast.
[4:06:35] <Louie_Salmon> I mean Pat literally asked for advice

[4:07:02] <%Ninestempest> RTFC RTFC RTFC
[4:07:03] <%bevyrage> pat you gotta read the cards BEFORE they trigger effects please
[4:07:04] <%kp539000> reading the card, explains the card
[4:07:04] <%SvenHolgersson> USE THOSE EYES
[4:07:04] <NiktenKing> LUL
[4:07:06] <%WheatlyXT> Save Glimpse for after TF is on the field first
[4:07:10] <+pectusumbra> alright, I'll admit, I laughed to see that
[4:07:17] <Venchair> well he's got tf in a few turns
[4:07:18] <@SoFarFetched> Guys I dont think you're shouting it hard enough.
[4:07:22] <DrStinkers> oh no
[4:07:29] <APB_Harleqyn> @nepwar I gotta admit you just made me do a spit take, hehe, nice
[4:07:29] <MyNameIsRasus> Good
[4:07:30] <Saturdaythe14th> this is fine
[4:07:34] <NiktenKing> Paige is Blind... but Pat actively choose not to use eyes
[4:07:38] <Saturdaythe14th> hey that's a good card there
[4:07:39] <MoonlightP> i think he could've chump blocked and set up for tf red card
[4:07:40] <+HyTricksy> thats a good one
[4:07:42] <%madskull456> cool that card has a snowman
[4:07:43] <+EndgameContent> Watching this is so stressful ngl
[4:07:44] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Pat. The little lightning bolt above that girl means she has an effect that is not a Play effect. So read any cards with that lightning bolt!
[4:07:45] <porygonftw> spider
[4:07:47] <SGrim> HE'S LEARNING MECHANICS woopsPog
[4:07:48] <Armthehobos> Has this game gotten pretty good reception then?
[4:07:49] <restingbones> Oh my gosh Woolie is Playing Skullgirls? WHERE DO I DIVERT MY ATTENTION!?
[4:07:54] <@SoFarFetched> both
[4:07:59] <%realm_forge> Holy crap just came back and Pat is STILL playing with his deck on steam.
[4:07:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Bofa
[4:08:00] <Saturdaythe14th> It's a pretty good card game I think most people agree
[4:08:02] <Venchair> skitt can hit face
[4:08:04] <nepwar> @APB_Harleqyn i have been known to have that effect on people when i say shit
[4:08:14] <mar_krow> curse
[4:08:20] <Saturdaythe14th> he's got options
[4:08:21] <MyNameIsRasus> Skiterrer won't be blocked
[4:08:27] <mar_krow> then glimse next turn
[4:08:28] <Louie_Salmon> There's arguments for each of these
[4:08:29] <SilentEric> Spider is a good one. Fearsome means they can't block it.
[4:08:34] <Saturdaythe14th> I think we're too slow of a deck to worry about going face with spiders
[4:08:39] <nepwar> @realm_forge gotta watch it like two tits on a hot girl
[4:08:50] <Saturdaythe14th> we're also so slow of a deck we'll die immediately, but hey
[4:08:53] <%realm_forge> Lol
[4:08:56] <Saturdaythe14th> upsides and downsides
[4:08:57] <Venchair> block the 3/2
[4:09:01] <Venchair> and then red card
[4:09:01] <mar_krow> grasp 4/3
[4:09:03] <$galaxyswirl> drain the 4/2
[4:09:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Tank it and drain after
[4:09:06] <Venchair> fuck
[4:09:07] <$galaxyswirl> 4/3
[4:09:07] <+R_BChe> grasp 4/3
[4:09:10] <%kp539000> grasp the ballista
[4:09:14] <porygonftw> good
[4:09:14] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @nepwar Or 2 dicks on a guys face
[4:09:23] <SGrim> Good play woopsPog
[4:09:24] <Saturdaythe14th> we're in no rush
[4:09:26] <Louie_Salmon> This is fine, we're fine, everything is fine
[4:09:27] <NiktenKing> Nice
[4:09:30] <MoonlightP> we're on the backfoot but we have plenty of late-game
[4:09:30] <mar_krow> lovely
[4:09:37] <Venchair> yellow card might be okay here
[4:09:39] <porygonftw> red card?
[4:09:41] <MoonlightP> ruination is gonna be a godsend late-game
[4:09:43] <%arcaderabbit48> How have the games been going?
[4:09:45] <%realm_forge> Make sure you drain the enemy’s deck or else nobody wins
[4:09:47] <zamzoph> attack & pilfer
[4:09:49] <Saturdaythe14th> gold card is fine, playing a spider is fine
[4:09:49] <mar_krow> low card
[4:09:49] <+chase959> red card for sure
[4:09:52] <nepwar> @XeroSigmaPrime Kreygasm

[4:09:55] <mar_krow> get spell slots
[4:09:55] <%arcaderabbit48> Red
[4:09:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Red card for sure
[4:09:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DONT RED
[4:09:56] <iosephe> Red Card
[4:10:00] <MoonlightP> red is fine
[4:10:01] <%kp539000> swing the 1/1 first
[4:10:03] <Saturdaythe14th> red is okay too
[4:10:07] <nathan652389> RED AND PILFER
[4:10:07] <Saturdaythe14th> many options
[4:10:08] <restingbones> Yellow?
[4:10:12] <%kp539000> he'll chump with 3/2
[4:10:16] <%kp539000> then use red
[4:10:17] <%GarbageNirvana> What's wrong with red
[4:10:17] <%Ninestempest> oooooh smart chat
[4:10:18] <%Buzzard42> w-why
[4:10:20] <flyingtentaclemonster> both are ok
[4:10:20] <+chase959> not enough mana for pilfer tho right?
[4:10:21] <mar_krow> too many options
[4:10:21] <iosephe> Red is good, but you can wait and hope he's a dumbass
[4:10:22] <%Buzzard42> @kp539000 who blocks that 1/1
[4:10:23] <$galaxyswirl> just do what you want
[4:10:23] <TyrantBelial> Red Card.
[4:10:24] <viewtifulr> play fast and loose pat Kappa
[4:10:25] <+chase959> after tf
[4:10:25] <porygonftw> ooo
[4:10:27] <%realm_forge> If the tip of your deck is red seek help immediately
[4:10:30] <restingbones> @nathan652389 he can't do both yet
[4:10:31] <%Ninestempest> uhh okay
[4:10:34] <%WheatlyXT> Red will make scarmaiden scary
[4:10:35] <flyingtentaclemonster> but now its yellow
[4:10:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HEHEHEHE THE POWER OF ONE GUY MUHAHAHAHA
[4:10:41] <zamzoph> now pilfer
[4:10:42] <%Ninestempest> no it was a good idea
[4:10:42] <MoonlightP> scarmaiden can't block tf though
[4:10:42] <Saturdaythe14th> because if the 1/1 dies a 4/4 comes out
[4:10:47] <MoonlightP> because tf has quick
[4:10:47] <restingbones> He doesnt want you to get a 4/4
[4:10:48] <Venchair> gold
[4:10:49] <Saturdaythe14th> he doesn't want to block it
[4:10:50] <iosephe> People don't have to do the bad thing
[4:10:55] <MyNameIsRasus> oof
[4:10:58] <%Jekado> no reason to block a 1/1 is why

[4:12:09] <Louie_Salmon> You clearly don't know what they do though
[4:12:10] <nepwar> can't ban someone for being wrong, then where would pat stream
[4:12:15] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Glimpse will let you play Black Spear.on the 6/1 and block the 7/6

[4:20:04] <+pectusumbra> To be fair it's like trying to get coached on a fighting game mid-match by chat
[4:20:06] <viewtifulr> doodFive doodFive doodFive doodFive
[4:20:08] <GFPPM> We'll all bad and that's ok
[4:20:09] <NiktenKing> It doesn't help when you don't know the cards
[4:20:10] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt I enjoy not being helpful if your gonna be like that. woopsTsun
[4:20:12] <awildgooseappears> youre welcome
[4:20:16] <Saturdaythe14th> and only some of the people coaching have played fighting games before
[4:20:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is like trying to be told what punch to throw in the middle of a boxing match.
[4:20:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Hey Pat, it's been fun
[4:20:25] <iosephe> Good hand!
[4:20:26] <%arcaderabbit48> Bold of you to assume I'm trying to be helpful
[4:20:27] <Saturdaythe14th> more than once some random person has shouted out a horrible idea
[4:20:29] <Jetsfantasy> PJSalt chat
[4:20:34] <%strakillias> Just play CoD to help relax
[4:20:44] <%WheatlyXT> Pat just win the game
[4:20:49] <+pectusumbra> speaking of, woolie's started skullgirling
[4:20:55] <%slaughtedlamb> how much of a hearthstone ripoff is this game?
[4:20:58] <mar_krow> PAT Believe in the heart of the cards
[4:21:04] <nepwar> protip: you win game when opponents health goes to 0
[4:21:09] <Saturdaythe14th> It's not really like hearthstone at all
[4:21:12] <porygonftw> pass
[4:21:17] <@SoFarFetched> This game has like a bit of everything in it
[4:21:19] <+EndgameContent> @slaughtedlamb It's much more like MTG than HS
[4:21:24] <SGrim> @slaughtedlamb it also has cards, and since Hearthstone invented cards, I'd say quite a lot. rooVV
[4:21:36] <Venchair> Oh not bad
[4:21:41] <Saturdaythe14th> it was so bold of hearthstone to invent the card game genre
[4:21:41] <+EndgameContent> @slaughtedlamb Although it generally has the best aspects of MTG, HS, and (weirdly) Pokemon
[4:21:46] <%iamnolionheart> I like that you can actually function during your opponent's turn, unlike Hearthstone
[4:21:48] <NiktenKing> Nice
[4:21:52] <+pectusumbra> that's the play
[4:21:54] <Venchair> care taker the fish

[4:23:10] <%kp539000> drain his 4/1
[4:23:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> When have WE EVER had anything useful to say?
[4:23:12] <LordWaldemaart> Feast on her
[4:23:13] <crimsonsaens> Drain when he attacks
[4:23:13] <restingbones> aww
[4:23:16] <reonome> are ya winnin son
[4:23:18] <%arcaderabbit48> @EndgameContent She voices Haru in Beastars too
[4:23:28] <%kp539000> he's becoming one with the heart of the cards
[4:23:30] <restingbones> you surprise him
[4:23:31] <iosephe> Information
[4:23:33] <porygonftw> bait
[4:23:34] <dinnydanny777> Elmo is so good at this game
[4:23:34] <+MillerLowlife> no dont look at us
[4:23:35] <reonome> bait
[4:23:40] <Venchair> it's best to do things at the least possible moment
[4:23:41] <Saturdaythe14th> it's fine to do it earlier, but surprising people is fine too
[4:23:42] <Torgue_1> Information
[4:23:44] <mar_krow> dont loook pat
[4:23:44] <porygonftw> bah
[4:23:44] <crimsonsaens> He would've attacked with 3/2 so you could get a good trade with your 2/1
[4:23:50] <%arcaderabbit48> Man, you can just tell when you do something someone doesnt expect
[4:23:52] <nepwar> makes them cry and shit their pants when you do it when they attack
[4:23:58] <Venchair> it's a sucker punch
[4:24:02] <iosephe> No spiderling but also they lost tempo
[4:24:03] <dinnydanny777> Elmo is so good at this game I don't even understand what he's doing
[4:24:04] <Louie_Salmon> He might have spent his mama, then he would be unable to glimpse there
[4:24:04] <+EndgameContent> @arcaderabbit48 Huh, figured. She's easy to recognize.
[4:24:04] <reonome> LUL
[4:24:08] <mar_krow> pass save mana slots
[4:24:15] <restingbones> GIVE PAT A CHANCE!
[4:24:16] <Saturdaythe14th> I guess he just doesn't like his 3/2
[4:24:30] <Saturdaythe14th> the ol' kill your own guy for no reason play
[4:24:33] <+EndgameContent> The voice acting in this game is pretty good
[4:24:35] <crimsonsaens> open attack
[4:24:36] <+pectusumbra> and woolie's stream starts with someone pretending to be his guest and jacking the first match. A M A Z I N G
[4:24:39] <%arcaderabbit48> @EndgameContent I feel like I hadn't heard her voice in years, now suddenly I'm hearing her everywhere
[4:24:40] <zamzoph> spiders
[4:24:41] <LordWaldemaart> attack
[4:24:44] <dinnydanny777> Elmo's plays are definitely beyond my level of comprehension and understanding
[4:24:44] <MyNameIsRasus> ye
[4:24:45] <crimsonsaens> yes
[4:24:47] <%s_xylocalsingles> yes
[4:24:47] <%Buzzard42> ye
[4:24:47] <Kalcom> spiders or attack
[4:24:47] <%kp539000> yup
[4:24:48] <Saturdaythe14th> yeah sure whatever
[4:24:48] <%s_xylocalsingles> attack
[4:24:48] <LordWaldemaart> y
[4:24:49] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah probably
[4:24:49] <Venchair> just attacking is less options for response
[4:24:50] <mar_krow> do coward
[4:24:51] <+pectusumbra> no reason to
[4:24:56] <iosephe> Could neverglade first, but yeah no reason not to
[4:24:58] <restingbones> Spiders first if youre feeling frisky
[4:25:02] <mar_krow> shot by spell
[4:25:03] <Louie_Salmon> Unless he somehow had no minion to play
[4:25:03] <Saturdaythe14th> you had options
[4:25:03] <awildgooseappears> pat dont look
[4:25:04] <viewtifulr> why are you asking us :)
[4:25:08] <zamzoph> LUL
[4:25:09] <porygonftw> wasteful
[4:25:10] <+pectusumbra> that's fine
[4:25:11] <+EndgameContent> Neverglade before spiders, probably
[4:25:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> You said we don't give useful advice, don't ask us. LUL
[4:25:13] <mar_krow> grasp
[4:25:14] <crimsonsaens> That's fine
[4:25:15] <restingbones> Damn, this guy is bad
[4:25:16] <$galaxyswirl> LUL
[4:25:16] <mar_krow> grasp op
[4:25:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Forced a resource out of him
[4:25:17] <reonome> its fine
[4:25:18] <restingbones> nice
[4:25:18] <Louie_Salmon> That is so good for us
[4:25:18] <Saturdaythe14th> Your opponent doesn't seem to know how to play the video game
[4:25:22] <+pectusumbra> leave it
[4:25:22] <LoneFonte> GOOD BAIT
[4:25:22] <MyNameIsRasus> It's fine
[4:25:23] <+EndgameContent> UPTRADE BABY
[4:25:24] <crimsonsaens> let him
[4:25:25] <iosephe> Don't do anything now
[4:25:26] <%Buzzard42> excellent bait
[4:25:27] <restingbones> ye
[4:25:27] <iosephe> Yeah
[4:25:28] <$galaxyswirl> that was a stupid thing that guy did
[4:25:29] <SilentEric> Wow. They invested a lot in this
[4:25:31] <%kp539000> yes
[4:25:31] <crimsonsaens> yeah
[4:25:35] <BlackermanZX> did he just waste grasp
[4:25:37] <porygonftw> pff
[4:25:39] <nechronia> And you still get damage done
[4:25:39] <Saturdaythe14th> This is a good teaching tool too, actually
[4:25:42] <%Buzzard42> they invested their entire turn getting rid of your 1/1
[4:25:42] <SilentEric> That speaks to not having a strong hand.
[4:25:44] <TheArrow_> they really wanted that 1/1 dead
[4:25:46] <reonome> nice
[4:25:46] <Saturdaythe14th> seeing somebody do terrible plays
[4:25:54] <zamzoph> notice that pat parses through his entire hand every time something happens?
[4:25:56] <Kalcom> but it hit like a 2/1!
[4:25:59] <crimsonsaens> Neverglade now
[4:26:02] <mar_krow> elise where r u
[4:26:03] <Venchair> 5 drop
[4:26:04] <%arcaderabbit48> Its cause he is new
[4:26:08] <%arcaderabbit48> And also anxious
[4:26:11] <twoto858> I do that too
[4:26:16] <%Jekado> i do the same in mtg
[4:26:18] <MyNameIsRasus> That's fine
[4:26:20] <unclekulikov> always read the cards.
[4:26:20] <Saturdaythe14th> He's just checking all his options it's fine
[4:26:21] <%Jekado> even when i have no instants
[4:26:22] <Louie_Salmon> I mean yeah he's new, that's good
[4:26:23] <crimsonsaens> It's fine, play Neverglade
[4:26:24] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I always look at my cards just because
[4:26:24] <%Buzzard42> no you're fine keep going
[4:26:27] <%iamnolionheart> I don't think this person has learned that the only important point of health is the last one
[4:26:29] <restingbones> @zamzoph youre saying that like its not the smart thing to do
[4:26:29] <reonome> people expect you to know all your cards lmao
[4:26:30] <IminyourBase> Memorize all your cards you fool
[4:26:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Neverglade would be good rn
[4:26:31] <+EndgameContent> That's normal for new players
[4:26:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Neverglade is my new BFF
[4:26:32] <%Chichen> you close your eyes and believe in the heart of the cards
[4:26:32] <MyNameIsRasus> Nice
[4:26:32] <nepwar> gotta parse your cards in case you missed the exodia card
[4:26:35] <%joylent_blue> its almost like he doesn't have everything memorized right off the bat
[4:26:35] <%Reevesypoo> When will we get Pat to play Yugioh guys Pog
[4:26:35] <mar_krow> pat your doing great number 1
[4:26:39] <porygonftw> NO
[4:26:39] <+MillerLowlife> looking at your cards is a classic mistake
[4:26:40] <%Agami23> its good to read your cards. it means you are literate
[4:26:42] <Venchair> you could have had a black spear here
[4:26:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Now he'll think twice before trading
[4:26:56] <eccentricprinceofroses> reading cards OMEGALUL
[4:27:02] <ShichiNoBushi> Blind and deaf.
[4:27:02] <eccentricprinceofroses> srsly tho read the cards

[4:27:15] <MoonlightP> he has neverglade out so he just gets hp back on trades
[4:27:18] <zamzoph> @restingbones it looks like he's checking for new cards in his hand when it's the same cards he's had all along

[4:28:08] <restingbones> @zamzoph He is new to the game, he doesn't have the muscle memory to know what ever card does and when he can play them. He needs to learn this and this is part of how to do it,

[4:29:10] <SGrim> Are you helping an opponent who can't hear you?
[4:29:11] <+preppyposs> he really doesn't want to use black spear

[4:31:01] <Saturdaythe14th> yeah buff that dead lady
[4:31:02] <%Buzzard42> that

[4:31:04] <SomeAsianDood> ok then
[4:31:06] <MyNameIsRasus> ?????
[4:31:09] <mar_krow> end her FINISH HER MK style
[4:31:13] <Venchair> he was on the bottom of the deck
[4:31:13] <iosephe> ouch
[4:31:14] <Venchair> it's fine
[4:31:14] <%Diana869> buying time
[4:31:15] <MyNameIsRasus> That's fine
[4:31:15] <%arcaderabbit48> That's fine
[4:31:16] <crimsonsaens> it's fine
[4:31:16] <MoonlightP> that's fine
[4:31:16] <%Jekado> i guess because i think you need 2 legal targets to cast that
[4:31:18] <+preppyposs> Toss is from bottom of the deck pat
[4:31:19] <nepwar> @reonome other guy probably pulled the cry and shit card right now
[4:31:19] <viewtifulr> AHAh
[4:31:20] <reonome> oh well
[4:31:20] <iosephe> But it's fine
[4:31:22] <+marlborored5> THERE GOES GOOD GUY LEDROS
[4:31:24] <MoonlightP> think of tossing like putting cards on the bottom of your deck
[4:31:25] <MyNameIsRasus> It was literally the last card
[4:31:26] <NiktenKing> Toss is from bottom
[4:31:26] <zamzoph> think of ledros being atteh bottom of your deck Kappa
[4:31:29] <%Buzzard42> @PatStaresAt don't worry too much about Toss, it burns off the bottom of your deck, so you were never drawing it anyways.
[4:31:31] <Saturdaythe14th> perhaps our opponent is a confused child
[4:31:33] <%Buzzard42> now you just KNOW not to count on it
[4:31:34] <MyNameIsRasus> You were not gonna draw it
[4:31:35] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Pat, I think this guy has the same problem you do. they think they HAVE to play a card at every given opportunity.
[4:31:35] <Saturdaythe14th> or some form of sentient cactus
[4:31:38] <mar_krow> grasp him pat
[4:31:40] <NiktenKing> You wouldn't draw it anway
[4:31:41] <+preppyposs> DRAIN HIM
[4:31:46] <Venchair> yeah toss is a card you'd never see naturally
[4:31:51] <+pectusumbra> I didn't know that either
[4:31:52] <TheArrow_> and it doesn't get rid of champions either
[4:31:53] <mar_krow> green hand pat
[4:31:54] <Louie_Salmon> This opponent is so dumb they're actually a good tutorial
[4:31:57] <%Buzzard42> Toss is great because it's just telling you what cards you weren't ever drawing
[4:32:06] <%kp539000> grasp
[4:32:07] <porygonftw> play one drop
[4:32:07] <mar_krow> pat green hand him
[4:32:09] <+pectusumbra> grasp looks good
[4:32:09] <SGrim> @Louie_Salmon harsh but fair
[4:32:11] <Saturdaythe14th> we can green hand or prey-remitter or all sorts of stuff
[4:32:16] <+pectusumbra> drain him
[4:32:17] <$galaxyswirl> sure
[4:32:17] <mar_krow> yes
[4:32:18] <restingbones> Sure
[4:32:18] <+pectusumbra> yeah, that's good
[4:32:19] <Saturdaythe14th> sure whatever
[4:32:19] <SGrim> Yes
[4:32:20] <+AceVenturaPhD> ye
[4:32:20] <Torgue_1> You got it
[4:32:20] <%Buzzard42> yeah
[4:32:20] <reonome> yes
[4:32:21] <SomeAsianDood> sure
[4:32:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Matchmaking in this game seems fairly accurate? I dont think I've run into anyone way above or below my skill level
[4:32:21] <+preppyposs> yes
[4:32:22] <crimsonsaens> okay, sure
[4:32:22] <%Diana869> sure
[4:32:22] <BlackermanZX> sure
[4:32:23] <Tempmael> yup
[4:32:26] <Saturdaythe14th> if we drain for nothing he'll get to play a card anyway
[4:32:27] <nepwar> suck his health dick to death
[4:32:29] <MyNameIsRasus> Unless he has a counter
[4:32:31] <NiktenKing> Unless there is a mechanic that will let you pull specifically from deck, then it doesn't matter for tossing
[4:32:33] <MyNameIsRasus> In which case
[4:32:33] <+AceVenturaPhD> green hand
[4:32:36] <+preppyposs> oh this dude IS an idiot
[4:32:39] <$KreegTTV> Howdy Pat, howdy chatroom
[4:32:40] <nepwar> get ready for the poop

[4:41:25] <+el_boney> That was a sick game pat
[4:41:27] <%WhereIsWill> good shit pat
[4:41:28] <NiktenKing> TF for double Redcard
[4:41:28] <mar_krow> kalista
[4:41:31] <restingbones> I mean... Twisted fate is best if you have lots of card draw to actually activate him.
[4:41:31] <+KilogramHours> RHASA
[4:41:32] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt elise is lower faster curve READ SCUTTLEGAST
[4:41:40] <Saturdaythe14th> pre-nerf rhasa was the dumbest thing ever
[4:41:40] <%arcaderabbit48> Reed Rhasa
[4:41:41] <flyingtentaclemonster> ether 1 or 3
[4:41:42] <MyNameIsRasus> Rhasa good card
[4:41:44] <Saturdaythe14th> he's still good now

[4:41:50] <+pectusumbra> so more spiders or kalista
[4:41:53] <SomeAsianDood> he's pretty 2 drop saturated though
[4:41:55] <Saturdaythe14th> all good options
[4:42:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat you did well
[4:42:09] <Louie_Salmon> @someasiandood A lot of those are spells though

[4:42:13] <Venchair> did you get the free poro from the shop pat?
[4:42:14] <iosephe> Most of those 2 drops are alter reaps
[4:42:15] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt now it's time for you to not play this long enough to forget everything again!
[4:42:18] <+KilogramHours> LoR IS SO GOOD
[4:42:21] <MyNameIsRasus> Good job!
[4:42:23] <cherrycottontail> tfw no teemo

[4:42:32] <Saturdaythe14th> good jorb
[4:42:33] <Louie_Salmon> This was a good and stressful time
[4:42:33] <NiktenKing> You did a good learn today
[4:42:48] <+pectusumbra> alright, this was fun. Would like to see more, honestly! Now, SKULLGIRLS
[4:42:56] <SomeAsianDood> @Louie_Salmon even then it's hard to play on curve unless you consistently get the kill an ally, draw 2. I didn't see how many copies he had
[4:43:42] <+AsinPersuasion> !uptime
[4:43:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 43m.
[4:43:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> I had to work so couldn't pay attention. On a scale of Suck to 10, how'd he do?
[4:44:04] <SomeAsianDood> 4
[4:44:16] <+AsinPersuasion> does he like it at least?
[4:44:18] <+KevinsLunchbox> 4
[4:44:24] <Louie_Salmon> @someasiandood 3 or 4 of them, definitely too many
[4:45:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> If anything, this seems to bring out the tried and true LoL toxicity, so that's good. XD
[4:45:51] <SomeAsianDood> hmmm I don't think it would be that bad to have 4 copies of that card.
[4:45:54] <%SvenHolgersson> OH GOD HES COMING THROUGH THE SCREEN
[4:45:55] <%SirGO0SE> psaWink
[4:45:57] <ShichiNoBushi> All hail Elmo!!
[4:46:00] <restingbones> @PatStaresAt Hi Pat, hope you had some fun with this great game idespite us in chat. Hope youll try the game out more on your own, since I think thats the only way to really learn.
[4:46:01] <zamzoph> I had fun
[4:46:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I enjoyed this WAYYYY MORE than I thought
[4:46:08] <+AceVenturaPhD> fuck did the dono have to be 5$ not 3?
[4:46:09] <%Jeemukun> s'alright
[4:46:12] <%GohanHitsugaya> All hail the mighty psaElmo
[4:46:20] <scrublord009> GIVE PAT BUDGET DECKS
[4:46:20] <zamzoph> just win 4Head
[4:46:20] <NiktenKing> Seems fun Pat, when you learn more combos, please play more
[4:46:21] <Ravoric> no :)
[4:46:27] <%SomeSageAdvice> i actually might hop into the game, it looked more interesting than Hearthstone
[4:46:29] <%Agami23> pat. i think i have an addiction to fishing
[4:46:29] <%BubbaRands> Shit-zillion and one
[4:46:30] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt i sent you DIRT CHEAP META DECK on twitter
[4:46:47] <@SoFarFetched> YOU TOLD THEM TO PAT
[4:46:48] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[4:46:49] <%SvenHolgersson> Hearthstone was fun at the beginning
[4:46:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> When you gonna fix the A/c... i want to see your orb
[4:46:53] <NiktenKing> LUL
[4:46:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you literally asked for this.
[4:47:04] <SGrim> All your questions are dumb, go on
[4:47:05] <%Ynkubus18> Dumb Answer
[4:47:10] <$valkuma> Butthurt.
[4:47:12] <scrublord009> nothing
[4:47:14] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Rage
[4:47:17] <%s_xylocalsingles> Clout
[4:47:17] <alwayspronking> not a fucking clue
[4:47:19] <%Ninestempest> i think it's just emotions
[4:47:20] <%BubbaRands> i imagine cards?
[4:47:22] <scrublord009> player matches and ranked are the same in terms of xp
[4:47:23] <@SoFarFetched> Theses are all good answers.
[4:47:23] <SGrim> More reward scaling, and a shit ton of salt
[4:47:24] <gir240> playing against better people thats it
[4:47:26] <Louie_Salmon> Exp I think that's it
[4:47:28] <+MisterCrimson> I find Twitch's double standards infuriating. Pat can't stream topless but Elmo can show us all his butthole.
[4:47:28] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt We just got a player icon in the beta season. No idea what they're going to offer in the future
[4:47:28] <NiktenKing> Nothing... YET
[4:47:28] <+DrFacilier> fuckin nothing
[4:47:28] <reonome> more exp
[4:47:29] <laserbeaming> Bragging Rights
[4:47:29] <$galaxyswirl> gloat
[4:47:31] <%s_xylocalsingles> Seasonal Card Backs i think
[4:47:31] <scrublord009> NO
[4:47:33] <%WhereIsWill> PJSalt
[4:47:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> XP is the same
[4:47:38] <restingbones> because its much better than heartstone. even back when hearthstone was good.
[4:47:39] <thetruthofyourbeing> YOU GET CLOUT
[4:47:43] <weirdmothgirl> Oh god he's actually doing it?
[4:47:44] <%PsycoZaku> you get xp for pvp, pvai, expedition, and quests
[4:47:46] <%Jekado> i bet they take cards away from you if you win ranked
[4:47:46] <Louie_Salmon> Don't you get more than AI matches?
[4:47:48] <scrublord009> Just farm man
[4:47:56] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt at the moment its nothing but if regular league is anything to go by, there will be ranked rewards in the future
[4:47:56] <reonome> you get more exp than ai matches
[4:47:58] <NiktenKing> Nothing, yet... League basically was the same at the beginning
[4:48:01] <+AlphaRayAllen> They'll probably have end season rewards because Riot but they haven't announced anything I don't think
[4:48:02] <restingbones> No, which is nice. since it doesnt feel like you are wasting your time, by playing normal mode.
[4:48:06] <%SirGO0SE> psaWhat
[4:48:08] <+DrFacilier> BUT UR AN INFLUENCER
[4:48:10] <gallohuegos> each mode has its own xp pool
[4:48:10] <+D00msDayDan> you can't eat clout
[4:48:12] <scrublord009> CLOUT STRIFE
[4:48:13] <%s_xylocalsingles> yes
[4:48:14] <$valkuma> Noone but dont tell that to twitter users.
[4:48:17] <laserbeaming> maybe
[4:48:20] <VritraReiRei> probably
[4:48:21] <gir240> Yea prob cuz its new
[4:48:21] <NiktenKing> Probably
[4:48:21] <thetruthofyourbeing> no
[4:48:22] <@SoFarFetched> probably
[4:48:25] <laserbeaming> It's bad
[4:48:27] <%WhereIsWill> probably
[4:48:27] <%s_xylocalsingles> yeah itll survive by force cause of riot
[4:48:29] <$galaxyswirl> oh def
[4:48:30] <gir240> I like it more than hearthstone
[4:48:32] <+EndgameContent> There will very likely be ranked rewards down the line
[4:48:32] <SGrim> It's got legs
[4:48:34] <thetruthofyourbeing> badderer
[4:48:34] <+MisterCrimson> @PatStaresAt ok, big question: Who do you want to voice Cid in Reunion or whatever part 2 is gonna be called
[4:48:35] <NiktenKing> They need to add Shurima and Mount Targon
[4:48:37] <Louie_Salmon> Riot usually supports stuff forever so yeah
[4:48:37] <+klassikFrank> Did you play Gwent at all?
[4:48:37] <@SoFarFetched> as long as LoL people exist,it will have players.
[4:48:39] <scrublord009> Hearthstone was a mistake
[4:48:40] <alwayspronking> probably. As long as League is alive
[4:48:43] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt it will last at least until you're bored and never play it again
[4:48:44] <+EndgameContent> It'll stick around for a while, it's where people from all the other card games are going.
[4:48:44] <$valkuma> its going to stick around because you only need a few whales to keep a game afloat.
[4:48:48] <reonome> ranked lets you watch your number go up
[4:48:48] <Louie_Salmon> StS is amazing
[4:48:51] <+AlphaRayAllen> I hope so, it's probably the best F2P system of any card games I've seen in a long time at least
[4:48:51] <NiktenKing> Yes, becauseLegends of Runeterra is an extension of the lore from League
[4:48:54] <%DEETRz> Monster Train is out and it's pretty good
[4:48:59] <%TheQButton> This game will be around untill the balance is lost like every card game :/
[4:48:59] <+el_boney> Take care
[4:49:00] <restingbones> Depends on how they handle future updates. So far they have been really good with balancing, and are actually listening to the players a reasonable amount.
[4:49:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> butter nipples
[4:49:22] <%BubbaRands> We'll beat Peagasus one day Pat!
[4:49:22] <%SirGO0SE> plss rimworld papa

[4:49:31] <SomeAsianDood> thank god they nerfed it
[4:49:36] <gir240> I think they are pretty balanced but man Unyelding spirit fiora decks make me rage
[4:49:40] <restingbones> thank god yeah
[4:49:45] <+AlphaRayAllen> I almost passed on this game because it was locked at 30 FPS
[4:49:50] <%GohanHitsugaya> Ohhh, pretty.
[4:49:50] <dinnydanny777> Elmo
[4:49:55] <scrublord009> Paige's butt is 9 mana 0/2 now
[4:49:56] <%SaiyanShoto> Pats playing with his pizza nips isn’t he?
[4:49:57] <dinnydanny777> I see cat

[4:49:58] <restingbones> @gir240 yeah, its on the watch list understandibly.
[4:50:12] <scrublord009> @PatStaresAt I haven't spent a cent. I have all cards

[4:50:20] <+el_boney> el_boney subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:50:24] <NiktenKing> They really want you to buy cosmetics
[4:50:25] <%BubbaRands> sooooooo....hats
[4:50:27] <scrublord009> 2/3 months
[4:50:27] <dinnydanny777> Elmo is really good at this game
[4:50:31] <NiktenKing> BUY THE BILGEWATER BOARD
[4:50:32] <restingbones> Like 2 months
[4:50:42] <%Ninestempest> idunno i didn't mind buying at all. I had like, 3 full decks for about 15-20 bucks? and thats with 6 champs in each deck. the money value is actually insane still
[4:50:44] <%s_xylocalsingles> yes
[4:50:45] <VritraReiRei> Typically League is just buying cosmetics
[4:50:47] <SGrim> yes
[4:50:48] <scrublord009> Yes
[4:50:48] <SomeAsianDood> yup
[4:50:50] <%TrebassTV> You can also use wildcards to get any card of that rarity
[4:50:54] <restingbones> yeps
[4:50:55] <NiktenKing> Yes
[4:51:00] <jimmytwofeet> IS PAT NEKKID?
[4:51:03] <therealtacopancakes> !uptime

[4:51:05] <+AceVenturaPhD> dono has to be $5 right? not the $3 minimum on there?
[4:51:13] <NiktenKing> Pat did you use Twitch Prime to get the free champion wild cards?
[4:51:15] <SomeAsianDood> @jimmytwofeet slathered in oil right now
[4:51:18] <+EndgameContent> It's very, very easy to get the specific cards you want
[4:51:21] <SummonerMagno> "accident"
[4:51:27] <restingbones> Not a Teemo?
[4:51:30] <scrublord009> The only cards that are hard to get are champions everything else is piss easy to get
[4:51:31] <jimmytwofeet> S L A T H E R E D
[4:51:55] <NiktenKing> A knee vee uh
[4:51:57] <scrublord009> Thresh Tryndamere can work too
[4:52:05] <zamzoph> more gundam PogChamp
[4:52:05] <gir240> You should make undying fiora deck to be a rage inducer
[4:52:06] <%WhereIsWill> issa Gundam!
[4:52:10] <SomeAsianDood> you get a free champ every week so they're pretty nice about that tbh
[4:52:10] <restingbones> Darious Thresh seems doable, but I havent seen it pulled off well it.
