[0:00:26] <%fanciful_fright> IT BACK
[0:00:29] <Astrophizz> Paige killing streams
[0:00:34] <$ItsRatman> Hi Pat you're back
[0:00:37] <%spitelite> both of you are streaming
[0:00:37] <+igniz13> you died
[0:00:42] <%NitronStreams> welcome back
[0:00:42] <%korean_random> STREAM AT RISK vargFloss
[0:00:44] <$realm_forge> I love when it crashes like this because I immediately have to suffer through a 30 sec ad with the sound blown out when it comes back in
[0:00:45] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> having paiges stream on at the same time makes the back and forth yelling fun
[0:00:48] <%Movemeister> LUL the Boivin curse is spreading
[0:00:49] <@PrefectusCorgi> And to your Podcast too
[0:00:57] <%shurtal> OBS knows what you did
[0:00:58] <Enn19> Paige cast Vulnerability as an aura LUL
[0:01:04] <%korean_random> that's normal
[0:01:10] <%Nobrev> I've seen a few streamers have a lot of trouble with OBS lately. I think an update broke it
[0:01:12] <Kyoshikei> @DamnFineCupofStreaming Really! Especially since her audio is back now LOL
[0:01:19] <+bigslinglelino> I didnt understand either but it look cool lol
[0:01:40] <1matheuw> lmao
[0:01:40] <ghostpopelive> OBS UNDEFEATED
[0:01:41] <Weberkraut> bless you
[0:01:47] <+bigslinglelino> The great thing about PoE is that they said fuck balance and let you go crazy
[0:01:47] <%Birthright_Redux> @PatStaresAt dude you can get BUSTED in this game
[0:01:53] <%korean_random> if you wanna get into this game, then you can expect Warframe levels of learning needed
[0:01:56] <1matheuw> #sponsored destiny slander
[0:02:00] <%AnthroMetal> warframe is calling you back pat
[0:02:00] <Weberkraut> on the league launch?
[0:02:12] <%korean_random> sick
[0:02:14] <+Kinoskae> with Paige & Plague???
[0:02:14] <Tempmael> minion build?
[0:02:15] <+Grayhammatter> oh really?
[0:02:17] <tanarath> Good stuff
[0:02:18] <anime_dude> man one day they will pay you enough to get you to endgame
[0:02:19] <%sandrews> this sold me to try it. looks cool
[0:02:23] <foxenco> goblins stream?
[0:02:24] <urkleturtle> they did blanket nerf everything three expansions ago, but they're building the powerlevel back up slowly
[0:02:26] <+igniz13> Go molten strike
[0:02:27] <+Grayhammatter> minion build lets go!
[0:02:29] <%korean_random> you going blind?
[0:02:31] <+Fefe41> Pat: so i've been grinding a bit offscreen and now im at endgame
[0:02:32] <Weberkraut> research what minion build you wanna do, because they're all different
[0:02:35] <%Birthright_Redux> do a little research beforehand, find a build guide
[0:02:37] <%AnthroMetal> i'll dig back into it and see if it sticks this time lol
[0:02:41] <%JohnMcClanesBrother> JohnMcClanesBrother subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Finally home from 3 weeks in Colorado for work. Now I get to Rise
[0:02:41] <%Birthright_Redux> you will enjoy it much more
[0:02:44] <Enn19> @PatStaresAt Just know that the curve is insane so take your time and go at your own pace
[0:02:46] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt you want easy gear guide while you play through main story? keep resistances at 75%. thats it
[0:02:48] <%Agami23> will paige be playing with you?
[0:02:49] <LoneFonte> how long does a season last?
[0:02:51] <+bigslinglelino> minion build goes hard

[0:03:06] <%Broand> Minion builds consistantly kickass in this game
[0:03:06] <Weberkraut> Skeletons are cool!
[0:03:07] <anime_dude> minion for new players has always been good
[0:03:08] <Enn19> There's also PoB
[0:03:08] <%NeoCre> BOY DO THEY
[0:03:09] <chowndawg> skeletons are pretty good
[0:03:11] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye, go Minions
[0:03:11] <tanarath> Minion builds are apparently only great? And yes, ask all of the question
[0:03:11] <%fanciful_fright> Why murder when you can have others murder for you?
[0:03:12] <+Tsumikiro> @LoneFonte 3-4 months
[0:03:13] <%MugenSandan> I wish I could have gotten more into PoE but once I finished the Acts and got to the Atlas I just lost all motivation to keep going :/
[0:03:14] <urkleturtle> just don't try a golemancer for your first minion build
[0:03:15] <%Movemeister> Thanks for strem
[0:03:15] <Weberkraut> theres different kinds of Skeletons even
[0:03:16] <+OldManJEWc> I love minion builds on Poe because I can swarm enemies with CROWS
[0:03:21] <+igniz13> Skeleton mage army
[0:03:22] <ghostpopelive> Minions are op still
[0:03:28] <tanarath> Do a big cheat & get a good build.
[0:03:29] <%NeoCre> Summons/Undead are punchy
[0:03:35] <%notsoy> pokeymans, with the pokey and the man
