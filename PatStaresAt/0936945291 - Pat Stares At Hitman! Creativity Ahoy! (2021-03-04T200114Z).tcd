[0:32:16] <+trackles_64> soda cans are the best knockout weapons
[0:32:24] <%coward_man> considering they're hungover as shit they probably wouldn't notice immediately and think he just passed out there

[1:47:05] <Zeif00> How bout that kpop killer in dbd?
[1:47:11] <%ClericOfSparda> That's some pretty graphics
[1:47:12] <+Javaa01> Oh by the way, if you want to enhance this beautiful vista, there is an easter egg on this map where a giant cockroach shows up over the horizon
[1:47:12] <+Frost_Quill> Finally leveled fishing in FFXIV, ocean voyages are RNG bullshit but relaxing.
[1:47:12] <heartlesshealer> oh wow, enjoy JackHavocmun
[1:47:14] <%Mr_Pylon> Hardspace is cool
[1:47:14] <%dj_xo98> Works boring but at least I can watch pat stream atm
[1:47:17] <purekyun> eating a cinnamon bun
[1:47:18] <+tigerfang86> thinking about my genshin builds and how long artifact farming will take bepSlain
[1:47:18] <+deathsmions1> Tap Noviob
[1:47:19] <%SaiyanShoto> Just get amnesia and play it again
[1:47:21] <%BinaryFireball> why do people like RE4?
[1:47:21] <+JackHavocmun> I played God Hand before RE4.
[1:47:22] <%the_mental_punk> Pat you ever played the forest?
[1:47:22] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt disco elysium devs went on record a couple hours ago that final cut is still set to release this month
[1:47:24] <penitentpendant> It'll be fun to see how deep his snores become as he gets bigger
[1:47:26] <+JackHavocmun> I feel like it prepared me for it.
[1:47:27] <trianglehat> Clap
[1:47:29] <+GenuineChillCast> debating what fighting game to get into now that guily gear is delayed
[1:47:36] <%logoth_> Im not ready for mirror pat
[1:47:36] <+Totally_Not_Toby> the ragdoll on that was incredible
[1:47:38] <%abusywizard> replaying NieR automata since ffxiv got me needing to scratch that itch
[1:47:40] <%ghostofsolomon> marvelous
[1:47:40] <%AzureGale> Well done, Pat
[1:47:41] <Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd
[1:47:43] <%logoth_> Accent Core XX
[1:47:46] <heartlesshealer> thinking about how I'll need a new cpu to play that Outriders demo
[1:47:47] <%BoxNavy> @PatStaresAt pat should i go get the aether currents in ff14
[1:47:48] <%DianaTheAscian> just wait for guilty gear
[1:47:48] <%bapposbungers> That's a good point.
[1:47:49] <%debugdrawray_> r+ has rollback now
[1:47:52] <%AzureGale> Get into Skullgirls, play some Annie
[1:47:58] <bonebagMEL> Skullgirls!
[1:47:58] <+vaporousTippler> Accent Core feels pretty great.
[1:47:59] <Ozavic> Any interest in a 2d dark souls like called Salt and Sanctuary? It can be co-op with Paige too for maximum comedy potential
[1:48:01] <%DashXero> I'm so glad GGStrive is delayed. It would have competed for time against Monster Hunter Rise.
[1:48:03] <+TyLeDouche> @patstaresat I'm waiting for disco elysium to come out for ps5
[1:48:05] <trianglehat> awesome
[1:48:06] <%DianaTheAscian> @BoxNavy YES
[1:48:08] <Felto3> you can use the tuctuc as an exit if you fix it but don't explode it
[1:48:11] <%twoto858> +R also has anew crazy training mode feature involving replays
[1:48:13] <DaKnightWarrior> Atleast we got more time to play MH Rise.
[1:48:14] <penitentpendant> Withdrawal from good rollback can be STRONG
[1:48:19] <+tigerfang86> OH NO
[1:48:22] <+tigerfang86> MYSTERY SYRINGE
[1:48:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He snores like how my dad snores

[1:48:25] <%BoxNavy> @DianaTheAscian moon2W uuuuuugh fine
[1:48:28] <trianglehat> explosive phone is fun
[1:48:29] <+Javaa01> Now you can make *anyone* shit themselves on command
[1:48:30] <+tigerfang86> now PAT is the one using the MYSTERY SYRINGE
[1:48:35] <heartlesshealer> god disco elysium with more voice acting is gonna be fucking fantastic when that update's done
[1:48:36] <Fro5tburn> samsung phone? Kappa
[1:48:38] <+CryptusMaximus> Ayo, Pat is the Revelations 2 stream still on indefinite hold? I've been catching up on all your RE videos.
[1:48:39] <Tuna_Can_0> mystery syringe monkaS
[1:48:44] <%DianaTheAscian> multiple
[1:48:51] <+BusterRepukken> This is the worst mission in the whole trilogy
[1:48:52] <%Valdorick> Its not a good level.
[1:48:53] <%Fooguwu> this one is wild
[1:48:57] <+GenuineChillCast> get ready for the most universally hated mission
[1:48:57] <%AzureGale> HE'S THE FASTEST THING ALIVE
[1:49:01] <%twoto858> oh boy, this level
[1:49:02] <+CryptusMaximus> WORST MISSION
[1:49:04] <+Frost_Quill> People shittalk this mission but it's not as bad as they say it is.
[1:49:04] <linSP> Z target the colonoscopy bags pat with dual wield syringes
[1:49:07] <%twoto858> at least it has a nice reference
[1:49:08] <%BoxNavy> :O
[1:49:08] <CassyASG> this is a fun level wdym?
[1:49:09] <+JackHavocmun> Olivia Hall...
[1:49:09] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[1:49:10] <+tigerfang86> CYBERCRIME
[1:49:10] <Zebroneath> this one is the low bar
[1:49:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> This one is a bit of a bitch only cuz it's hard af to get in in the first place
[1:49:14] <+JackHavocmun> Why is that name familiar?
[1:49:16] <gslayer14> hmm
[1:49:18] <%aishman> Worst map time

[1:49:48] <%abusywizard> love da puppo snore, reminds me of my old dog psaGiefrail
[1:49:50] <+tigerfang86> FRUIT KING
[1:49:50] <%Pappajimbo> the mysterious hacker known as 4chan
[1:49:57] <+BusterRepukken> 4 targets on one map.
[1:49:57] <%Movemeister> Eli monkaS
[1:50:00] <heartlesshealer> we have baby snore to distract us from level
[1:50:03] <MoonKing> there's a pig somewhere
[1:50:05] <luisaglez_3> the snore
[1:50:08] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:50:08] <heartlesshealer> so it'll be fine
[1:50:13] <penitentpendant> Saw that George Carlin bit again, "If crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight?"
[1:50:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Go kill Cheese Wizz
[1:50:18] <CassyASG> yeah its rly fun imo
[1:50:19] <%the_mental_punk> that snore is like a bear

[1:50:25] <%Broken_Sonex> psaDogchamp SNOOORRRRRRREEEEE
[1:50:25] <+blkalucard1> that snore lol
[1:50:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can get 2 of them at once with one of the mission stories @PatStaresAt
[1:50:27] <+TheButterBabe> it's a mask
[1:50:29] <+thelonechris> This is the worst one
[1:50:31] <+Javaa01> Yeah, 4 targets on a relatively small map full of enforcers, can you start to see why this isn't a fan favorite
[1:50:32] <+Totally_Not_Toby> he's so a baby
[1:50:32] <%AzureGale> He's a shy guy
[1:50:32] <%ghostofsolomon> wha is this?
[1:50:39] <+BusterRepukken> he's an interrogator who wears a scary mask
[1:50:41] <heartlesshealer> HOLD HIM
[1:50:41] <bonebagMEL> he snore just like his papa
[1:50:42] <%BoxNavy> guys its not gief paige is dragging a wooden chair along the floor
[1:50:43] <%chiazam> FOUR BABYEEE
[1:50:44] <%DashXero> Oh man... It seems like it'll be tough to take out another assassin.
[1:50:44] <NitronStreams> Bichael Byers
[1:50:51] <%ghostofsolomon> why is there michael myers
[1:50:51] <CassyASG> aww baby snores
[1:50:55] <%Movemeister> You know why
[1:50:56] <skyentombment> fluffin a pooch?
[1:50:56] <%AzureGale> Flop dat boot
[1:50:58] <%chiazam> Because he is
[1:51:13] <%cephalon_nyt> he flopping all four boots
[1:51:13] <+JackHavocmun> 'You have four targets, 47. They're all aboard the Costa Concordia. However you see fit to neutralise them, just make it look like an accident.'
[1:51:14] <trianglehat> LUL
[1:51:20] <heartlesshealer> don't chase him away, he just needs to not sleep near the mic LUL
[1:51:28] <+Javaa01> Yeah it is not great
[1:51:28] <%BoxNavy> chats saying it sucks
[1:51:28] <trianglehat> it's a long one
[1:51:28] <%BinaryFireball> fuck it
[1:51:28] <+trackles_64> its a long one
[1:51:30] <+GenuineChillCast> is that how paige wakes up too?
[1:51:30] <CassyASG> the goodest biy
[1:51:31] <+TheButterBabe> yeah it's not great
[1:51:32] <%chiazam> Even RTX cannot defeat the PUPPER
[1:51:33] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL
[1:51:34] <+BusterRepukken> its the hated one
[1:51:34] <Felto3> it is shit
[1:51:40] <+Tuffty> People REALLY hate this one
[1:51:41] <Bigyanno> It's actually a good mission
[1:51:43] <CassyASG> its not bad at all
[1:51:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's honestly not that bad, I don't get why people hate it THAT much
[1:51:48] <+Javaa01> This is a mission you get out of the way so it *stays* out of the way
[1:51:49] <heartlesshealer> night time green
[1:51:53] <+CryptusMaximus> my least played map
[1:51:54] <+BusterRepukken> but ya gotta muscle through to get to a super good mission
[1:51:54] <+GenuineChillCast> its the most hated of the trilogy
[1:51:55] <+trackles_64> logic
[1:51:55] <+Frost_Quill> It's not as bad as people hype it up to be.  It's relatively annoying to get started but that's really it.
[1:51:56] <+robert_edwards> @patstaresat your audio levels where you want them, something sounds odd
[1:51:57] <skyentombment> @JackHavocmun "Vada a bordo, cazzo!" "Excellent work, 47"
[1:51:59] <%BigDumBeak> just do the wicker man easter egg and make it fun and quick
[1:52:00] <+Javaa01> Yeah this level is just grayish brown all the way across
[1:52:00] <NitronStreams> hope you like green
[1:52:06] <%thetrashman_sc> this is the worst mission in the game
[1:52:11] <%ghostofsolomon> stick to the coin
[1:52:12] <%Mr_Pylon> I think it's the worst of this Hitman, but it's not a terrible map.
[1:52:14] <+JackHavocmun> :>
[1:52:17] <+idyota> Worst mission in all three games imo
[1:52:23] <katamariofsoul> It's probably the worst mission in the game, yeah, but it's still pretty alright I'd say
[1:52:26] <+trackles_64> Sniping on this level is fun
[1:52:27] <$Dakuu75> target looks like that dude from RE 6
[1:52:31] <kozakthered7> I watched a video recently that said this is one of the worst missions.
[1:52:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> O yeah Pat's fiber wire thing is gonna make this WAY harder
[1:52:34] <skyentombment> Our least fashionable location to date
[1:52:37] <+JackHavocmun> Ah yes. Apricots. The most evil of fruits.
[1:52:38] <katamariofsoul> Like, the worst this game has to offer is still pretty fun
[1:52:40] <Ipsenscastle> oh no its colorado
[1:52:46] <Tuna_Can_0> I forget is this a HM1 level?
[1:52:51] <trianglehat> oh no not gorilla warfare
[1:53:00] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:53:05] <+zepelinnn1> hope you like the whole fucking map being hostile with the suit, thats the worst part for me
[1:53:10] <heartlesshealer> colorado is hostile
[1:53:13] <+Javaa01> @Tuna_Can_0 This is the second to last level of 2016
[1:53:18] <%chiazam> Why are PRIVATE MILITIAS ALLOWED
[1:53:24] <%BoxNavy> good luck with the SA
[1:53:27] <%rytisone> time to bring out ak-47
[1:53:34] <%AzureGale> "Wait, it's all hostile?" "Always has been"
[1:53:37] <DaKnightWarrior> You got this.
[1:53:38] <+Javaa01> Yeah, there's no public areas here
[1:53:39] <+transporterthesequel> Because FREEDOM
[1:53:39] <+upandadam> guns blazing
[1:53:40] <penitentpendant> G'luck Snake
[1:53:44] <trianglehat> LUL
[1:53:45] <+upandadam> start it up
[1:53:48] <Yakobro> LUL
[1:53:50] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:53:52] <bonebagMEL> This is a metal gear level
[1:53:53] <heartlesshealer> slurp meter
[1:53:54] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Am I being detained?
[1:53:54] <%Mr_Pylon> citizens arrest
[1:53:58] <scrimscromble> smooth start
[1:53:58] <+upandadam> what difficulty is this
[1:54:01] <%Alazull> This is America
[1:54:02] <%AzureGale> Under arrest to AMERICA
[1:54:04] <NitronStreams> Small but Highly aggressive... who does that remind me of
[1:54:05] <+Higure_yoru> go to horny jail
[1:54:06] <+trackles_64> have to be more stealthy
[1:54:07] <+JackHavocmun> 'Excellent work boss. That's why you're the best.'
[1:54:10] <%Valdorick> CITIZENS ARREST! LETHAL FORCE IS AUTHERIZED!
[1:54:14] <skyentombment> @chiazam Private militia is a strong word! Think of them as an ABUNDANT number of bodyguards
[1:54:19] <%colouroftheiris77> What is this, America???
[1:54:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah these chucklefucks on a farm with guns are gonna arrest you for being bald
[1:54:23] <Zebroneath> I do like 47's default outfit in this level
[1:54:28] <heartlesshealer> US under arrest = dead, so I guess that works for this game
[1:54:33] <%Valdorick> Colorado, infact.
[1:54:33] <+trackles_64> murica
[1:54:37] <%BinaryFireball> A vault
[1:54:42] <katamariofsoul> Sovereign citizens making their own arrests
[1:54:43] <dukenux> Is this the final mpa?
[1:54:46] <dukenux> *mao
[1:54:58] <%chiazam> @chiazam Bodyguarding the US of A
[1:55:00] <+Frost_Quill> @dukenux Nope.
[1:55:07] <scrimscromble> just sneak past them with hitman power
[1:55:07] <trianglehat> yep
[1:55:07] <$Dakuu75> OMG that's the fucking SCHOOL FIRE-ALARM DRILL NOISE, fucking hate that noise
[1:55:16] <skyentombment> @heartlesshealer Hey, c'mon, that's on a color gradient basis!
[1:55:18] <%miguelrod777> dead
[1:55:20] <trianglehat> convenient box
[1:55:28] <scrimscromble> thwok
[1:55:29] <trianglehat> not so convenient guard
[1:55:31] <Zebroneath> As a reminder, there were no bushes originally in Hitman 1
[1:55:32] <Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd nice shovel
[1:55:34] <revoltingimp> a fucking shovel goddamn
[1:55:38] <+Higure_yoru> alarm?
[1:55:39] <%miguelrod777> thowk
[1:55:41] <dukenux> @Fro5tburn did he play that japanese resort map, or is that after this mission
[1:55:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think you get it back when you hide the body
[1:55:46] <%GarbageNirvana> p sure the other dude noticed you huckin a shovel at that guy
[1:55:53] <+Javaa01> @dukenux Next mission
[1:55:56] <Seraphim9> thats after
[1:55:56] <devanmuse> All of Colorado is just like this
[1:55:57] <linSP> the shovel is lethal throw
[1:55:57] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Hokkaido is last
[1:55:57] <Ipsenscastle> should'a waited for him to turn the alarm off
[1:55:58] <katamariofsoul> @dukenux Thats the next mission
[1:56:02] <%DashXero> How can you tell what rating you have mid-mission?
[1:56:10] <dukenux> @Javaa01 ah thanks
[1:56:11] <skyentombment> BIG DISTRACTION OMG
[1:56:21] <linSP> brrrr
[1:56:23] <penitentpendant> @DashXero The little green crossed guns in the bottom left
[1:56:33] <Seraphim9> there's an indicator at the bottom left that turns red when you lose silent assassin rank
[1:56:35] <SolidusA> Sniken bokem
[1:56:36] <Tuna_Can_0> best throw weapon is still coconut :)
[1:56:39] <+Javaa01> @DashXero Green icon on the bottom left next to the map tells you if you are eligible for silent assassin
[1:56:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> turn of the beepo pls
[1:56:54] <katamariofsoul> @DashXero Its new for 3
[1:56:56] <%DashXero> @penitentpendant @Javaa01 Ah! Thanks, guys!
[1:57:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> nvm I guess that guys got it
[1:57:04] <Bigyanno> This mission is a lot easier when you can start inside the compound
[1:57:08] <Giztech> did you just lose it again?
[1:57:13] <+JackHavocmun> 'Woah buddy. You shave bald and get a tattoo? That's one hell of a forklift alarm.'
[1:57:15] <Ipsenscastle> lost SA
[1:57:20] <heartlesshealer> @heartlesshealer well they shot that one white lady who called them to report a possible [trouble] occurring near where she lived. Not gonna deny extremely heavy bias for deaths though
[1:57:22] <linSP> But howww
[1:57:24] <CassyASG> how did he lose itagain
[1:57:25] <%chiazam> NOW the real Hitman can Begin
[1:57:30] <%DashXero> @katamariofsoul That makes sense.
[1:57:35] <+BusterRepukken> he let a camera see him
[1:57:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> He got caught on the camera guys
[1:58:02] <katamariofsoul> Yeah, he'll get it back if he deletes the footage
[1:58:13] <%miguelrod777> ü§î
[1:58:21] <%asgard147> 3D printed Mask
[1:58:25] <%miguelrod777> a mask you say
[1:58:31] <scrimscromble> just shoot em
[1:58:36] <skyentombment> KILL HIM NAO
[1:58:44] <Fluffy_Tamamo> I do like that 3 has a unique icon for salvageable cam-fail
[1:58:55] <heartlesshealer> oooh, a trespass boundary
[1:58:58] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt You're not a part of the demo crew as of right now, so that's off limits for your safety
[1:59:01] <%chiazam> Yeah he has a mask, I WONDER
[1:59:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's a bunch of areas you need specific disguises for on this map
[1:59:03] <+Vikingdeath1> This level ended up being the one i've played the most I think
[1:59:03] <Bigyanno> Learning the areas in this mission can be a bit weird
[1:59:12] <Tuna_Can_0> you gotta upgrade to henchmen lvl 2
[1:59:15] <ape_hawk> did pat poop his pants yet?
[1:59:24] <Valdorick> Yeah, the sequels borked their lines.
[1:59:39] <+tigerfang86> MERICA
[1:59:42] <+tigerfang86> FUCK YEAH
[1:59:46] <+trackles_64> its how the lol design works, different levels of security.
[2:00:05] <%chiazam> Why would he call you sir!?!?
[2:00:27] <+thelonechris> He didn't seem to care all that much
[2:00:30] <%JoshManVGH> Wow, topline security.
[2:00:51] <trianglehat> nice
[2:01:00] <%JoshManVGH> "You don't have surprise bathroom buddies in your country?"
[2:01:04] <heartlesshealer> got cloth get
[2:01:10] <heartlesshealer> good*
[2:01:11] <gslayer14> guns aren't illegal here, obvious in hindsight
[2:01:20] <heartlesshealer> brain failing I need a water
[2:01:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> Do whatever the training mission story is, lets you get two targets
[2:01:35] <skyentombment> @JoshManVGH Easy there, Rolf
[2:01:49] <revoltingimp> warning shots are bullshit anyway, so i respect that
[2:01:52] <+Shady_Zaku> TerrorBBQ
[2:01:58] <%Movemeister> It had to be terror cooked

[2:28:00] <%bassoontyphoon> WHO SAID THAT?
[2:28:01] <+tigerfang86> BRUH
[2:28:09] <%ghostofsolomon> lol
[2:28:13] <%walternatorz> Wow, she can talk and snore at the same time.
[2:28:17] <tolloponik> snoring comes from bad back posture though?
[2:28:19] <%KineticZen> His, name's Sean
[2:28:21] <+tigerfang86> why is she WEARING THE DEATH WATCH
[2:28:24] <+SlashHabit> smooth talk it off
[2:28:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> you need the OTHER army man clothes to go in there
[2:28:30] <DaKnightWarrior> We need a Gief cam <3
[2:28:38] <%X2Eliah> Naw snoring comes from too much tissue in throat
[2:28:41] <linSP> Wouldn‚Äôt YOU want a death watch
[2:28:42] <+Javaa01> The watch is on the OCD guy, can you guess when he would take it off for a longer then usual time for a regular person?
[2:28:56] <CassyASG> he takes it off but you have to trigger his ocd like you did with the giys dead mom
[2:29:00] <%brickwall35> HONK.....HONK.....HONK
[2:29:07] <Sunstalker> To pee?
[2:29:20] <linSP> no the SA
[2:29:40] <+Javaa01> @Sunstalker What does a decent person do after peeing, and what does a compulsive person do *excessively* after peeing?
[2:29:43] <+Parrish_broadnax> Is that Zang? or is pat smuggling an elephant ?
[2:30:03] <+deathsmions1> this map sucks for silent asa

[2:30:17] <katamariofsoul> Because someone caught you trespassing
[2:30:18] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:30:19] <+Javaa01> Earlier in the mission
[2:30:21] <%X2Eliah> rip
[2:30:21] <CassyASG> you were found tresspassing earlier in the level
[2:30:24] <%rytisone> you lost it a long time ago
[2:30:35] <Zebroneath> I think you were found tresspassing  a lot earlier
[2:30:37] <Ozavic> You lost it before you killed mask bro
[2:30:45] <+SlashHabit> where do you see the silent assassin thing?
[2:30:52] <linSP> he got it back after destroying the cams tho
[2:30:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> You didn't notice because you already got camera'd at that point @PatStaresAt
[2:31:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> Oh
[2:31:11] <%Mr_Pylon> save for green?
[2:31:14] <Ozavic> Fair enough, didn't know cams turned it red

[2:33:25] <yourliteraldog> 47 you mush shit in his toilet tank
[2:33:29] <%bassoontyphoon> can you mess with his chess board???
[2:33:37] <+Javaa01> @dukenux Just take fat dump just directly in the middle of the carpet, that'll get him
[2:33:39] <+Shady_Zaku> "Good work 47, excellent upper decker"
[2:33:51] <yourliteraldog> hide in the closet?
[2:33:58] <%Fooguwu> lmao
[2:34:00] <%brickwall35> LUL
[2:34:01] <%chiazam> He SENSES a disturbance in the Force
[2:34:03] <%X2Eliah> ok?
[2:34:05] <%ghostofsolomon> lol
[2:34:25] <dukenux> he walks in and immediately notices someone been in the room

[2:35:13] <%Mr_Pylon> that has to be an icon bug
[2:35:19] <ArcKnightNova> that has to be a bug, it was green for sure at one point
[2:35:20] <+SlashHabit> Too many saves?
[2:35:20] <dukenux> "Hmm, Diana, i try to sneak through this compound, but it seems my behind is dummy thicc"
[2:35:22] <%AzureGale> Has to be from a while back
[2:35:25] <+BusterRepukken> bug i think
[2:35:32] <Vargrey> Yeah, must be a bug.
[2:35:37] <CassyASG> the trespassing i bet it was bugged
[2:35:42] <Vargrey> Hopefully just visual
[2:35:47] <linSP> fuggg
[2:35:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm like 90% sure you got caught a long time ago and destroying the cameras bugged it
[2:36:03] <CassyASG> main menu
[2:36:10] <Djinnazz> main menu screen
[2:36:12] <%Mr_Pylon> featured, bottom right
[2:36:16] <+trackles_64> the snoring is getting you spotted
[2:36:16] <Johker> Dang did Pat get a new cam?  Looks good.
[2:36:22] <linSP> yeah you saved after you got SA back
[2:36:24] <CassyASG> it happened to me to lol
[2:36:38] <+trackles_64> the ui sucks
[2:36:42] <%brickwall35> restart the playthrough
[2:36:43] <+Javaa01> @Johker Nah he just realized he had been running it at 480p all this time
[2:36:48] <Johker> Also who tranq darted a bear in the basement
[2:37:12] <+Tuffty> Getting SA first time on this map is kinda rough, I wouldn't really sweat it
[2:37:16] <Johker> the sad thing is @Javaa01 is that that can be the truest statement in the world or the boldest of lies and neither would surprise me lol
[2:37:52] <+Javaa01> @Johker Check his twitter and tell me which one it was
[2:38:03] <Johker> lol god okay, ty
[2:38:12] <Zebroneath> WHOOOO?
[2:38:12] <$Dakuu75> Is gief doing battle with his sleep paralysis demon?\
[2:38:14] <CassyASG> lmao
[2:38:27] <dukenux> :(
[2:38:28] <trianglehat> he HATES it
[2:38:30] <+thelonechris> ?
[2:38:34] <%asgard147> is it? kappa
[2:38:40] <linSP> man if someone messed up my stuff I would literally combust
[2:38:41] <+BusterRepukken> hes also an actual psychopath tho
[2:38:46] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:38:49] <%orcstr16> Hey stream. Is Pat done with this level yet?
[2:38:58] <%CokeMilkRequiem> Preform a heat action
[2:39:07] <dukenux> His goblins are the strongest breed
[2:39:24] <dukenux> :)
[2:39:44] <ExpressNode> Just got back after reading Jojo part 4 and 5. Only two words: KING CRIMSON
[2:39:48] <+CryptusMaximus> Kill his goblins Pat
[2:39:51] <+BusterRepukken> confiscating it
[2:39:57] <%king_wragles> This level blows
[2:40:00] <+Tuffty> Oh noooo
[2:40:06] <%orcstr16> @ExpressNode It just works.
[2:40:26] <%BoxNavy> UH OHHH
[2:40:27] <%brickwall35> it's just packet loss
[2:40:31] <%chiazam> whoops
[2:40:32] <$Dakuu75> I'm starting to feel bad for this guy
[2:40:36] <ExpressNode> Also I just noticed pat switched over his camera
[2:41:00] <%chiazam> @Dakuu75 don't forget he's a terrorist
[2:41:07] <+chaumiester> Probably sounds more natural then saying "Writing Instrument"
[2:41:07] <+thelonechris> He doesn't care about the one guard just standing over him
[2:41:13] <%ttc_lover> Why... why is your video mirrored?
[2:41:16] <PinoProxie> let him enjoy the order one last time
[2:41:17] <sendart> or they didn't want to model both pencils and pens
[2:41:26] <Ipsenscastle> did you lose SA again?
[2:41:30] <ExpressNode> @orcstr16 Yeah now I'm just reading Part 6
[2:41:43] <spacecatstreams> hitmun
[2:41:46] <$Dakuu75> @Dakuu75 I completely forgot he was a terrorist
[2:42:04] <+Javaa01> Yeah you turned off his sink so now he will never be clean again
[2:42:17] <+Javaa01> He will, give it a sec
[2:42:41] <+BusterRepukken> you turned off his water pipe
[2:42:44] <+trackles_64> pat you committed a war crime denying access to water.
[2:42:47] <Djinnazz> he going for cigsd
[2:42:50] <Djinnazz> cigs
[2:42:58] <Storm_Samurai> I just stop playing this and now I see Pat playing
[2:43:01] <dukenux> he walks weird
[2:43:04] <+CryptusMaximus> Lol you upset him with the other story trigger
[2:43:12] <dan_g_v> is that Gief snooring?
[2:43:19] <Captain_Joe1911> doh! >(
[2:43:32] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5HUM zzz
[2:43:38] <Storm_Samurai> What goal is he going for now
[2:43:39] <%AzureGale> F
[2:43:43] <%juxtest> The briefcase on the floor
[2:43:43] <%Fooguwu> paige :(
[2:43:44] <theshillman> did paige dead?
[2:43:46] <%orcstr16> I never bothered with this mission story. It looks just awful.
[2:43:46] <Felto3> you can put the drugs outside for a diff story
[2:43:54] <+Javaa01> Yeah you got the challenge done, it's fine
[2:44:00] <theshillman> am paige become skeleton??
[2:44:02] <Storm_Samurai> Ah must be watch bomb
[2:44:09] <+Javaa01> Yeah, it ain't good
[2:44:15] <Storm_Samurai> Or OCD one
[2:44:19] <Ipsenscastle> it's a boring mission
[2:44:23] <dukenux> i thought the purpose of death watches was being alarmed if one of them dies
[2:44:24] <+Javaa01> There's a reason why basically no one likes it
[2:44:25] <+BusterRepukken> the next mission is super good tho
[2:44:27] <Djinnazz> it's the woods
[2:44:27] <%AzureGale> There are too many targets
[2:44:31] <%Mr_Pylon> yeah finish it up and onto the next
[2:44:39] <Zebroneath> It's not particularly great
[2:44:40] <dukenux> yeah, this level is just an obstacle course
[2:44:42] <CassyASG> the snow ones
[2:44:47] <Storm_Samurai> This one is not great except for holdup training area
[2:44:48] <+CryptusMaximus> You don't like wood and dirt Pat?
[2:44:49] <+Shady_Zaku> Hitman 1 or Hitman ONE
[2:44:50] <Zebroneath> I remember that one, it's also not great
[2:44:53] <%colouroftheiris77> I haaaaaaaaated that mission
[2:44:55] <+Shady_Zaku> like the OG Hitman
[2:45:05] <penitentpendant> I keep coming to these streams and people keep going "Yeah THIS is the worst mission" on different missions.
[2:45:07] <Rionxgarland> oh yeah getting to the gang base in hitman 1
[2:45:17] <%orcstr16> This is easily the worst mission in the new trilogy. I think the three target missions in 2 are way better.
[2:45:21] <Storm_Samurai> You da Pointman
[2:45:29] <dukenux> ...you mean Rotterdam?
[2:45:32] <%chiazam> Why does he have a Limp?
[2:45:35] <Storm_Samurai> Berlin Club my fav
[2:45:43] <Storm_Samurai> He had a training accident
[2:45:44] <+CryptusMaximus> H2's missions are literally some of the best in the trilogy.
[2:45:46] <+chaumiester> You're the MC from FEAR 1?
[2:45:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> So you can get the OCD guy with this story as well, 2 for 1
[2:45:59] <%brickwall35> it's not polite to ask about a disability like that
[2:46:09] <dukenux> @CryptusMaximus some of the worst too(fuck the snow tunnel)
[2:46:10] <Zebroneath> Yeah, I don't blame you
[2:46:11] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I legit did all but one in my first go
[2:46:11] <Storm_Samurai> This is actually best story
[2:46:12] <+Javaa01> They really aren't worth it outside of just getting the 20 mastery levels
[2:46:19] <%chiazam> Maybe walk with a limp Pat
[2:46:25] <dukenux> oh wait, you mean the NEW Hitman 2
[2:46:36] <+CryptusMaximus> @dukenux No, not THAT H2. This new H2
[2:46:44] <CassyASG> i feel like this level is more like older hitman games you have plenty of oppurtunites outside of story missions to kill them
[2:46:47] <+BusterRepukken> no hes just not showing up
[2:46:53] <spacecatstreams> i like when the thing go smashy
[2:47:12] <Storm_Samurai> She‚Äôs very aggressive
[2:47:27] <Storm_Samurai> 1 2 3 dum dums
[2:47:35] <Felto3> only good thing about this map is the dumb scarecrow easter egg
[2:47:41] <CappuccinoGuil> What a GREAT plan debriefing, huh?
[2:47:45] <+Stormzcales_Lair> she just can't hide it
[2:47:58] <Storm_Samurai> Get crowbar
[2:48:09] <+CryptusMaximus> Pat that's cheating LUL
[2:48:09] <Storm_Samurai> Hehehe

[2:48:49] <Storm_Samurai> Rtx onnnnnnnn
[2:48:52] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah IOI have this obsession with Bloom that I just don't understand

[2:49:24] <yourliteraldog> storm trooper aim
[2:49:24] <+DoktorZee> watch dogs 3 looks cool
[2:49:24] <%brickwall35> Pat shoot the one with an indicator above it
[2:49:26] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt suppress and eliminate the driver
[2:49:29] <CassyASG> the briefing?
[2:49:30] <%wujak> follow the green marker
[2:49:30] <+Stormzcales_Lair> So Pat (47) is working to prevent this practice senario from happening ?
[2:49:31] <sendart> just hose the whole limo down
[2:49:31] <+EmptyPenguin> left to right at her command
[2:49:32] <Storm_Samurai> Left to right
[2:49:38] <%Movemeister> ^
[2:49:55] <%brickwall35> you don't even have to shoot the driver chat
[2:50:04] <Storm_Samurai> Not bad
[2:50:28] <Djinnazz> missed it
[2:50:35] <%Valdorick> "Oh thank god, the diplomat left a crowbar on the back of the car"
[2:50:43] <%Movemeister> All this Gief snoring is making me tired
[2:51:05] <+DoktorZee> holy shit gief is such a big ol sleepy baby
[2:51:25] <dukenux> OOF
[2:51:29] <%AzureGale> GOTEM
[2:51:31] <tattleworm> how unfortunate
[2:51:34] <%Alopekis> I can't believe that accident that just happened!
[2:51:35] <CassyASG> oh no what happuned
[2:51:38] <%baka_sugoi> casual  accident
[2:51:40] <Seraphim9> WHOOPS
[2:51:41] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun uyuyuyuTokichan ? uyuyuyuUshi1 ?
[2:51:46] <penitentpendant> Wait, how long has he lost Silent Assassin?
[2:51:47] <%juxtest> Who could have done such a thing
[2:51:48] <Fro5tburn> how could this have happened D:
[2:51:50] <dukenux> man, those hydraulic presses, you gotta be careful with them, mang
[2:51:52] <Zebroneath> How can this BE????
[2:51:53] <Storm_Samurai> Rammmmmmm
[2:51:54] <%king_wragles> You're gonna want to holster
[2:51:59] <%orcstr16> I always find it hilarious that they never try to stop the person who pushed the button that killed someone.
[2:52:02] <%CokeMilkRequiem> i uh...i better go
[2:52:04] <%chiazam> God that's messed up
[2:52:09] <%Alopekis> Poopy
[2:52:13] <+Javaa01> It's a shitpit
[2:52:13] <%DianaTheAscian> oooo
[2:52:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> The GOO PIT
[2:52:22] <+CryptusMaximus> Scarecrow perch to blend in with, if you have a scarecrow outfit
[2:52:22] <dukenux> garbage pool
[2:52:23] <%Tearonex> you'd think people would be more on alert
[2:52:25] <%CokeMilkRequiem> even if it was an accident people would vbe questioned
[2:52:26] <+Javaa01> Everyone here shits in that pit
[2:52:32] <$ItsRatman> pollution oh okay thats cool
[2:52:33] <dukenux> you dont have on in your backyard?
[2:52:36] <Djinnazz> @orcstr16 if you stick around they do.
[2:52:49] <Zebroneath> nice tar pit
[2:52:55] <linSP> It‚Äôs blight town
[2:53:15] <+Javaa01> Yeah, exactly
[2:53:18] <%Valdorick> Nailed it
[2:53:27] <dukenux> yea
[2:53:28] <%Alopekis> Technically there's slight verticality.
[2:53:40] <%AzureGale> use coin
[2:53:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> poison that cup
[2:53:49] <spacecatstreams> bonk his head
[2:53:51] <%Alopekis> Throw apricot
[2:53:59] <+CryptusMaximus> For me, the kills are fine, I just despise the lack of social stealth. The draw of Hitman is that you are in public areas most of the time
[2:54:15] <%TheFramedWarlock> Haha orb go shank
[2:54:20] <linSP> syringe him!
[2:54:28] <%hrbeck_> hrbeck_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Did the ginger goblin finally trick- wait, was it the skeleton lust woman who tricked- someone is being tricked. I just don‚Äôt know who. Anyways, I wish you eternal happiness and shit like that.
[2:54:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> That sounds like farting not snoring lol
[2:54:33] <%TheFramedWarlock> Gieffie is snoring GivePLZ
[2:54:36] <%TheFramedWarlock> He so precious
[2:54:57] <+thelonechris> I wish you could somehow sneak that badge out of his pocket or something
[2:55:19] <+BusterRepukken> you should stream Thief
[2:55:34] <+CryptusMaximus> You don't technically
[2:55:41] <+BusterRepukken> you dont 'have to' if you know what to do
[2:55:53] <%Alazull> There's a couple where you have to listen until the detail you need comes up
[2:56:38] <+abrupt_abe> I keep thinking they have a bear growling in a cage
[2:56:42] <dukenux> bitcoin farmers. kill em all
[2:56:43] <+abrupt_abe> but it's just the dog
[2:56:47] <%Alazull> You know, you mentioning pickpocketing now has me wondering if someone could make a Thief style game using this engine.
[2:56:55] <+Catpurnicus> knocking out hammerites and tossing them into the river was the best
[2:57:01] <yourliteraldog> lol
[2:57:02] <+Catpurnicus> RIP thief
[2:57:09] <yourliteraldog> context sensitivy
[2:57:13] <+CryptusMaximus> Turn that engine off to lure him away
[2:57:31] <%Fooguwu> NotLikeThis
[2:57:34] <NitronStreams> Pain.
[2:57:43] <+Javaa01> You can skip listening to the conversation, just go straight to poisoning the coffee
[2:57:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Stop moving so fast Pat lol
[2:57:51] <%BinaryFireball> shoot em all?
[2:57:55] <%BinaryFireball> is that viable?
[2:58:11] <%Alopekis> That is absolutely viable.
[2:58:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah every part is like JUST annoying enough
[2:58:17] <%CokeMilkRequiem> 2Pat 2Furious
[2:58:18] <%Valdorick> Sniper Assassin says what?
[2:58:21] <yourliteraldog> yes
[2:58:21] <+Javaa01> But funnily enough, lighting them all on fire IS viable on this level
[2:58:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Okay, Go slower but at a faster rate lol
[2:58:22] <scrimscromble> just use your gun to shoot them
[2:58:28] <%AzureGale> Sleepiest doog
[2:58:28] <VioletRosefall> do not wake the doggo-pig
[2:58:28] <Felto3> just become scarecrow
[2:58:30] <+CryptusMaximus> To be fair this is the wrong game for any degree of impatience LUL
[2:58:34] <BackflipCharm> I don't know about shooting them all on a map where literally every NPC has a gun
[2:58:39] <+thecosmicfly> So I see Pats on Colorado today. Hows his general opinion of it been so far?
[2:58:52] <scrimscromble> uh gross
[2:58:54] <%notsoy> it sucks
[2:58:55] <Seraphim9> mostly negastive
[2:58:55] <+Stormzcales_Lair> he no like
[2:59:00] <ExpressNode> Poopoo peepee
[2:59:01] <%HairballCT> @thecosmicfly bad
[2:59:03] <+Javaa01> Take a beeg sipp
[2:59:11] <%Alopekis> @BackflipCharm It's definitely able to be done. Especially if you go in the house. They basically just let you kill them at that point.
[2:59:50] <%NovaKnightmare> now he will choke on the vomit still in his throat
[2:59:51] <Djinnazz> SAVE
[2:59:52] <%NovaKnightmare> good job Pat
[3:00:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Thats a fucked way to die. Throwing up and then get choked
[3:00:17] <NitronStreams> He wants to be tall

[3:03:18] <%notsoy> SAVE PLS
[3:03:32] <%Alazull> That's a nasty way to die
[3:03:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat saving more often than artists working on Photoshop
[3:03:41] <%Alazull> Is it slurry for leatherworking?
[3:04:31] <+DoktorZee> why did that work
[3:04:38] <PinoProxie> ...the guards are in earshot tho
[3:05:00] <%Alopekis> Patience Pat
[3:05:01] <+CryptusMaximus> yeah make her eat shit, literally

[3:05:28] <$ItsRatman> Blegh
[3:05:30] <%miguelrod777> what a shitty way to die
[3:05:31] <%brickwall35> how is she dead
[3:05:34] <+Javaa01> And now to suffer the horrors of 3D printing
[3:05:35] <theshillman> uh oh stinky
[3:05:38] <dukenux> worst death
[3:05:40] <+chaumiester> She can't swim....>
[3:05:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> That is....a fucked up way to go
[3:05:43] <%AzureGale> What if she can't swim
[3:05:45] <+chaumiester> ?
[3:05:45] <+thecosmicfly> @Dakuu75 the slurry be thick
[3:05:47] <+LordGeneric> She's too gross to live so she accepted death
[3:05:47] <yourliteraldog> toxix poop
[3:05:50] <%Fooguwu> it's probably like tar
[3:05:51] <linSP> why have a poop put tho
[3:05:57] <%Alopekis> @chaumiester Poop is harder to swim in than water.
[3:05:57] <%CokeMilkRequiem> To the Poop Dimension with you
[3:05:57] <%brickwall35> you don't drown instantly
[3:05:58] <linSP> pit*
[3:05:59] <+BusterRepukken> its tar and poop
[3:05:59] <%notsoy> is no silent assassin because of that live-fire exercise you snuck into/]
[3:06:04] <+BusterRepukken> its also very deep
[3:06:04] <%notsoy> any way to fix?
[3:06:17] <dodgy_dingo_> empty a clip init
[3:06:22] <%Alopekis> Just walk away
[3:06:27] <+CryptusMaximus> best mission
[3:06:27] <%Broken_Sonex> I WAS THIS CLOSE MATE SWEAR ON ME MUM
[3:06:28] <Ipsenscastle> done fucked it
[3:06:37] <NitronStreams> time to slurm again
[3:06:41] <+Stormzcales_Lair> LUL
[3:06:48] <+thecosmicfly> Honestly I imagine if Pat was even half submerged in slurry, head up, he'd also immediately die
[3:06:56] <%CokeMilkRequiem> imagine getting poop killed 3 times
[3:06:59] <%Alopekis> Why? lol
[3:07:02] <NitronStreams> pat...
[3:07:04] <%Alopekis> Paaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[3:07:07] <quinndan> how does that instantly kill someone? cmonBruh
[3:07:09] <Ipsenscastle> wtf
[3:07:13] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Guessing we wont see Hokkaido tonight, he sounds pretty done. haruchiSmug
[3:07:17] <+CryptusMaximus> He plays these missions at such a breakneck pace LUL
[3:07:18] <Grennold> rip waifu FeelsBadMan
[3:07:43] <CassyASG> there is a disguise in the truck
[3:07:45] <dukenux> @CryptusMaximus i see what u did there
[3:07:47] <+BusterRepukken> if you know what you're doing, you can move at a breakneck pace
[3:07:51] <Tuna_Can_0> You need lvl 3 henchmen access
[3:07:54] <+blkalucard1> that sounds like the frustration of a guy who doesn't flip the peanut butter upside down
[3:08:00] <%Alopekis> @quinndan Depending on how deep it actually is, it's possible that she hit the bottom hard enough to either kill her or knock her unconscious. Outside of that, I don't know. lol
[3:08:03] <Ipsenscastle> hokkaido is a great palate cleanser
[3:08:05] <dodgy_dingo_> grunser here
[3:08:05] <%Fooguwu> maps are pretty poggo
[3:08:14] <+CryptusMaximus> @Fluffy_Tamamo He averages about 2 missions per stream anyway. We all told him Colorado sucks.
[3:08:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> I found Hokkaido way harder than this level TBH
[3:09:02] <%Alopekis> @ReallyBigRocks It's harder, but it's much more fun.
[3:09:02] <%G_Thunders> Eh, a lot of the deaths happen faster than they ‚Äúreally‚Äù would. I think it‚Äôs just IO‚Äôs way of avoiding making the Hitman series less murder-porn and more video game
[3:09:11] <+CryptusMaximus> Hokaido is amazing
[3:09:17] <Bigyanno> Hokkaido is way harder tho imo
[3:09:21] <%Valdorick> Its also the BEST LEVEL IN ONE
[3:09:24] <%BinaryFireball> isnt that where the sauna monkeys are?
[3:09:25] <dukenux> Hokkaido is purdy
[3:09:30] <%Fooguwu> hokkaido is great
[3:09:33] <Djinnazz> why?
[3:09:35] <Seraphim9> Hokkaido is way better tbqh
[3:09:37] <%Alopekis> Punch him
[3:09:40] <Ipsenscastle> it was a bummer
[3:09:40] <%orcstr16> Oh boy were we.
[3:09:45] <nukle0nik> why reload just run away
[3:09:50] <Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd
[3:09:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> The nerds don't like it when you touch their 3d printer
[3:09:51] <%BinaryFireball> or hot springs monkeys I should say
[3:09:51] <Bigyanno> I actually really like this mission
[3:09:55] <%Alopekis> You already lost silent assassin. You don't have to restart at every mistake. lol
[3:09:59] <$Dakuu75> that was a big woman-grunt
[3:10:03] <+CryptusMaximus> Honestly, I liked it more when it was episodic. Started hating it more when I was replaying everything later in Hitman 2.
[3:10:07] <+Javaa01> @nukle0nik You need to wait for like 20 seconds for the 3D printer finish
[3:10:13] <+Tuffty> The good thing Pat is that it's literally the worst mission of all 3 games
[3:10:21] <%BoxNavy> for FREE
[3:10:23] <%BoxNavy> ?
[3:10:25] <dukenux> well, first impression and all
[3:10:26] <%fritz_dacat> even on my ps4
[3:10:29] <Zebroneath> I hope that game is good on release
[3:10:29] <linSP> I feel bad for anyone trying to do this mission SASO on the highest difficulty
[3:10:32] <Jimhalla> for FREE!
[3:10:36] <%Alopekis> Did you say FREE?!
[3:10:36] <%G_Thunders> Colorado is fine cause at least it‚Äôs condensed. The worst levels are the ones where it‚Äôs 75% street level with buildings you cant enter
[3:10:37] <dukenux> whoa
[3:10:38] <%king_wragles> And Xbox One!
[3:10:40] <+thecosmicfly> How much is the demo again?

[3:11:12] <+Javaa01> @linSP Thankfully the SASO route for this is very optimized and comprised of accident kills only, so it doesn't matter who sees it happen

[3:14:02] <heartlesshealer> he probably hates how the alcohol smells
[3:14:05] <Bigyanno> He sounds like a purring cat

[3:18:26] <xcompleasedad> The Crow his ass
[3:18:28] <%AzureGale> Wait until you see the briefing for Hokkaido

[3:20:21] <dukenux> "ICA has been compromised" AGAIN?
[3:20:25] <Zebroneath> Asshole who tried to make you fail was the real villain
[3:20:39] <Ipsenscastle> please don't do Colorado twice
[3:20:46] <+Javaa01> 3 does a pretty solid job of blending the plot into mission design
[3:20:52] <%Alazull> There's a couple in 3 that are good
[3:20:57] <%Alopekis> He's doing it 3 times
[3:21:01] <Zebroneath> The most heavily storybased ones in 2 are the best
[3:21:02] <%G_Thunders> Hitman 3 actually works the story into the gameplay
[3:21:04] <heartlesshealer> thank fucking god
[3:21:08] <skyentombment> 4 STARS, BETTER REDO

[3:22:02] <+ModestAlienWaltz> @hrudzie_1 Oh yeah. Just about every minute or so.
[3:22:11] <+Javaa01> Cause the crowbar is just a straight upgrade
