[0:15:00] <%ComfySoxs> @AngriestPat are you going to check out disco elysium?
[0:15:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> There's a lot of AMAZING stuff on GamePass.
[0:15:03] <+FrostMass22> game pass is worth it just for outer worlds
[0:15:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like Bloodstained
[0:15:08] <$StarlitStunner> zoneHype Gob-olin zoneHype
[0:15:08] <+blitzrush1200> Pick up bloodstained while you're at it
[0:15:11] <$Mighty_observer> or you can play it for free
[0:15:13] <%StaceMcGate> cheer500 Pat, your and others recommendation of Outer Worlds made me swallow my pride and download the outer worlds. My fears about Epic were confirmed when on the FINAL mission my game crashed and I lost 15 hours of progress sending me all the way back to Monarch. Fuck this platform and anyone who defend.
[0:15:13] <derap41> Epic has covered their assess cost wise
[0:15:15] <%theMrRoboto> apatCanada
[0:15:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> and Gears 5 is OK
[0:15:19] <Monkeyweed21> IT HAS HOLLOW KNIGHT AND UNDERTALE
[0:15:20] <@lewdskeletor13> Playing this game for 1 dollar is highway robbery
[0:15:21] <%ape_hawk> Outer Worlds is DEFINITELY worth the 60bux
[0:15:22] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Wut.... I pre ordeed at full price like a fool
[0:15:29] <+chaumiester> I missed it. Will there be a podcast release tomorrow?
[0:15:30] <+Fynale> it's literally a netflix for games cuz games could be taken off at any time BUT you do get a discount for buying them
[0:15:34] <Conyst> unfortunately I cannot subscribe again on the sixth of next month
[0:15:35] <%vaporousTippler> Game Pass let me play a bunch of shit I never got around to. Not sure if it'll be worth it long term.
[0:15:39] <%ShineTheDiamond> @StaceMcGate I'm sorry. That sucks so hard
[0:15:41] <+FrostMass22> @lewdskeletor13 Epic already paid for my copy lul
[0:15:45] <%Doruben> adelaide

[0:15:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> nah
[0:15:54] <+alphonseisbest> there is
[0:15:54] <derap41> The game is not binary think outside the box that's all I'm saying
[0:15:55] <%cvp5127> burn harder?
[0:15:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> it's gotta be done
[0:15:58] <GoldySUP> @StaceMcGate That sucks, but you should've gotten the game pass version
[0:15:59] <startstoprepeat> well
[0:16:00] <%StaceMcGate> @ShineTheDiamond I was literally in dialogue with the main villain
[0:16:01] <SvenHolgersson> But the fire tho
[0:16:02] <startstoprepeat> almost everyone
[0:16:04] <person181> but we must salt sarthage
[0:16:04] <%vaporousTippler> Oh god. Pat killed people in that?

[0:16:21] <%Valdorick> But do you get their loot if you do this non-kill'em all option?

[0:16:30] <%Bluwizard21> dont shill out, do your game
[0:16:31] <%Sadira_snack_attack> I think the people in Edgewater want to die

[0:19:54] <Monkeyweed21> Did he not save?
[0:19:54] <%cvp5127> shhhh
[0:19:54] <%Kataguro> Cloud saves?
[0:19:54] <tigerfang86> JUST SAVE
[0:19:54] <SoySocks> maybe a cloud save issue?
[0:19:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Why did you get it off of Epic and not the Microsoft store
[0:19:56] <+Fynale> the cloud saves or something corrupting
[0:19:58] <nomos42> Yes. Socialists are known for their hate for workers
[0:19:58] <+코코꾸라> There are autosaves
[0:19:58] <$Mighty_observer> thays open world games
[0:19:58] <tigerfang86> SAVE
[0:19:59] <%ape_hawk> the game auto saves, dude

[0:20:08] <+blitzrush1200> Did it corrupt it?
[0:20:09] <stinkydinks> dspRevolver dspCowboy dspRevolver_HF cloud saves
[0:20:10] <%honeyman18> ONE SAVE
[0:20:12] <@lewdskeletor13> I’m confused
[0:20:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Should we tell him where the sweet ass hammer is? Its easy AF to get
[0:20:12] <+alphonseisbest> MANUEL SAVES PEOPPLE
[0:20:12] <tigerfang86> SAVE YOUR GAME WOOLIE
[0:20:13] <derap41> Does the epic store have cloud saves
[0:20:13] <+FrostMass22> @lilmkatsu Tell that to the people bringing politics into chat first
[0:20:13] <%augusm> augusm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Will you be watching The Witcher Netflix Series? Also Big Nut or Cumbo?
[0:20:14] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat I don't know, my sync was from Saturday
[0:20:14] <%ShineTheDiamond> @LilMKatsu He was put in time out last stream
[0:20:16] <%Artemis_Scowl> Artemis_Scowl subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! hey pat hey chat!
[0:20:17] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat super nova mode?
[0:20:19] <%Sadira_snack_attack> The game autosaves so much more than that
[0:20:19] <@lewdskeletor13> ALWAYS MANUAL SAVE
[0:20:20] <Ion_Laser> I guess the game crash corrupted the save somehow
[0:20:20] <%ArcanumMBD> sounds like someone didn't pay attention to the cloud save message on launch
[0:20:21] <%Teintstein> Cheer500 haven’t been able to catch most of the Outer Worlds streams because I’ve been in Germany for the past week - can’t wait to fly back home tomorrow so I can buy this game and binge the fuck out of it
[0:20:23] <%alcors_wisdom> oh yeah it auto clouds so and unless your off line it pulls from that first and overwrites your home save
[0:20:30] <majindusto> JUST TO FUCK WITH PEOPLE
[0:20:30] <stinkydinks> dspSubhype dspDableft dspDabright dspSubhype
[0:20:33] <$Timesteel> the real question is why didn't you save for 15 hours
[0:20:34] <@lewdskeletor13> @fynale Doing that on his second run
[0:20:35] <LilMKatsu> @FrostMass22 so? don't became part of the problem
[0:20:36] <SGrim> @AngriestPat and how do I do that?
[0:20:42] <$Mighty_observer> happens in all fallout games and all elder scrolls games
[0:20:53] <+redsonyou> Pat what do you think of Death Stranding coming to PC?
[0:20:56] <majindusto> LOL
[0:20:56] <%terribleusername> shocking really
[0:20:56] <%StaceMcGate> I MADE MANUAL SAVES EVERY 20 MINUTES, FOR SOME REASON IT SENT ME BACK TWO DAYS
[0:20:57] <%CJett92> shocking
[0:20:58] <%Kataguro> But RoAdMaP
[0:20:58] <+Fynale> @lewdskeletor13 i'm saying that might be why they lost progress cuz super nova doesn't auto save as much as the other modes
[0:20:59] <%crimsonharvest> on the Microsoft store i had to decline the Live login to completely avoid having cloud saves
[0:20:59] <%alcors_wisdom> honestly never got cloud saves
[0:21:02] <+blitzrush1200> Add that to the list of features to fix
[0:21:02] <deviljhojho_> fuck yea streams
[0:21:02] <$Mighty_observer> YOU DON'T SAY?
[0:21:02] <%thetrashman_sc> no really
[0:21:03] <%ArcanumMBD> @angriestpat that's a lie, unless you did additional shenanigans. check your taskbar. launching through steam still launches EGS
[0:21:04] <%ape_hawk> apparently the epic games store...not good
[0:21:07] <%Valdorick> I'm shocked a store without a shopping cart has bad cloud saves.
[0:21:08] <$floralkami> LIVE TECHNICAL SUPPORT
[0:21:09] <%Quigsies> They said it would from day one?

[0:22:56] <%ShineTheDiamond> @AngriestPat SOme guy named FrostMass22 is being a butt
[0:22:58] <This_is_Marco> pats too generous with bans, just start perma banning
[0:23:06] <%StaceMcGate> Has he started Parvati's companion quest yet is the big question?
[0:23:06] <%CJett92> apatSleep
[0:23:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Mighty_observer Feddies started it.
[0:23:09] <+gkingsausagelink> see ya later no want spoils

[0:23:12] <StrayShep> tomatoKnife tomatoCult
[0:23:12] <SparkAfterDark> Do Parvati's personal quest asap! It's amazing and the best. No spoilers, but it's adorable.
[0:23:12] <%Valdorick> Sound is PERFECT - until the first gunshot, then I'm sure it'll be RIP headphones.
[0:23:17] <$Mighty_observer> pat is daemon
[0:23:18] <%thetrashman_sc> the theme is really good SourPls
[0:23:19] <%CJett92> I think hes just about to leave the first planet?
[0:23:23] <%ThatOneGameTester> lol the ship is called the unreliable LUL
[0:23:23] <tigerfang86> Reminder that your ship is the UNRELIABLE
[0:23:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Was gonna save these streams for later, but I'm bored as heck
[0:23:27] <LilMKatsu> @FrostMass22 I was responding to you ya about shit you were saying fool LUL
[0:23:33] <jcflyguy> "The Unreliable" is the best ship name.
[0:23:34] <+Fynale> sadly this game also feels like obsidian ran out of fucking time
[0:23:34] <person181> her quest takes a bit so no rush but do it all the time
[0:23:36] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Dude it's kinda creepy how close your character is to IRL you. All you have to is remove his shins and it's just Space Pat
[0:23:44] <majindusto> Death Stranding Comes out Next week on Nov 8...no need to wait a year for it to be on PC
[0:23:45] <+quietusswain> It’s been awhile since I’ve watched Firefly but every time you walk through your ship I can’t help but think the layout is very similar to Serenity.
[0:23:49] <Trillex56> turn him on
[0:23:52] <%StaceMcGate> SAM is the best combat companion in game, dude is a beast
[0:23:56] <%ThatOneGameTester> @ScreamLord LUL
[0:23:57] <%starotter70> Oh wow, that's just pat
[0:23:57] <%CJett92> ye
[0:23:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Can’t unlock SAM till the third zone
[0:24:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Game is bit quiet
[0:24:00] <%ape_hawk> its fine
[0:24:02] <Monkeyweed21> louder
[0:24:02] <count_bob> Good.
[0:24:02] <jcflyguy> Max is quiet.
[0:24:05] <%Kataguro> Golden Rotation activate
[0:24:09] <%alcors_wisdom> fine but a little low
[0:24:09] <+hahyeahok> turn up game a bit
[0:24:09] <tigerfang86> THE GOLDEN ROTATION
[0:24:09] <%thetrashman_sc> Parvatis personal quest upsets me for petty reasons
[0:24:09] <AgentD3wDub> thats good balance tbh
[0:24:10] <austyn_do> good
[0:24:10] <Rotwik> voice is low
[0:24:11] <%Quigsies> Maybe a liiiiiitle louder
[0:24:12] <%CJett92> Its ok, maybe a bit quiet
[0:24:12] <+FrostMass22> @lilmkatsu Don't care, you're a hypocrite.
[0:24:12] <mrcelab> could be more louder, the vic
[0:24:13] <@lewdskeletor13> Good
[0:24:13] <derap41> Max is the bestest boy
[0:24:14] <$Mighty_observer> you're always to loud pat
[0:24:15] <$Timesteel> bump up game audio a bit
[0:24:15] <%Run44forrest> stream keeps buffering is it just me?
[0:24:15] <%RadicalPirate> a little low
[0:24:16] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat can you read the words in max's book?
[0:24:18] <tigerfang86> THE POWER OF THE GOLDEN ROTATION, JOHNNY
[0:24:19] <%cvp5127> YOU CAN KICK PPL OFF
[0:24:19] <Jaller101514> 10% up
[0:24:20] <%ShineTheDiamond> Smidge louder, but good overall
[0:24:22] <%starotter70> Ask about Lesson 5
[0:24:23] <Trillex56> did you know tho
[0:24:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't completely trust Max.
[0:24:27] <%Artemis_Scowl> Max is trying to reach that Golden Ratio
[0:24:29] <%Kataguro> Arigato, Gyro
[0:24:29] <%honeyman18> LOUDER
[0:24:29] <LilMKatsu> @FrostMass22 and you are blocked, bye :)
[0:24:31] <Monkeyweed21> ARIGATO, GYRO
[0:24:33] <+metzselaar> Lesson 5!!!!
[0:24:33] <+chaumiester> Oh wow, you can kick members out of your team entirely...
[0:24:34] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm AMAZED he's a companion
[0:24:36] <%StaceMcGate> @thetrashman_sc because you're helping the only interesting companion hook up with someone else?
[0:24:44] <%dalmek> Seems good
[0:24:44] <mrcelab> better
[0:24:44] <%CJett92> thats good
[0:24:45] <jcflyguy> Better
[0:24:45] <Monkeyweed21> thats good
[0:24:45] <%Quigsies> Good
[0:24:48] <+FrostMass22> Is there a point to locking people off your ship?
[0:24:48] <+NitronStreams> Main menus are always 2x as loud as everything else and I hate it
[0:24:48] <+griffball13> good
[0:24:48] <SpaceGuntank> good to go
[0:24:49] <%salty_syd913> good
[0:24:49] <%Kataguro> It's fixed
[0:24:50] <%ShineTheDiamond> Perfect!
[0:24:50] <austyn_do> good
[0:24:52] <%Valdorick> Perfect
[0:24:55] <+FrostMass22> Kicking people off
[0:24:56] <%alcors_wisdom> @rumtumtugnutz i trust max the most his motives are clear his actions are certain
[0:25:00] <Monkeyweed21> what about the line? @AngriestPat
[0:25:01] <%RadicalPirate> Better. Though vicar Max tends to speak softly
[0:25:01] <%starotter70> Who's this VA? sounds familiar
[0:25:01] <%Kataguro> It's good
[0:25:02] <This_is_Marco> youre good
[0:25:03] <%dalmek> None that I hear
[0:25:03] <person181> no
[0:25:04] <Gorgen> The PLAN ORTHUR lawlmanHowdy
[0:25:05] <SpaceGuntank> all clear
[0:25:06] <%DracaenaLeaf> Nope sounds good

[0:25:07] <tigerfang86> you're good
[0:25:08] <%ThatOneGameTester> sounds good friendo
[0:25:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Sound good to me
[0:25:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> A philosfister sounds danergous
[0:25:11] <%CJett92> Not even any weird lines on the side of the screen this time
[0:25:13] <%Kataguro> TAHITI, ORTHUR
[0:25:16] <reonome> muted Kappa
[0:25:18] <deviljhojho_> crikWorm Pardner
[0:25:18] <+FrostMass22> @gorgen Max NEEDS MONEY
[0:25:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dangerous too
[0:25:23] <%thetrashman_sc> @stacemcgate more or less
[0:25:25] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat can you read the words in max's book?
[0:25:32] <Trillex56> pat you cant steal in your own fucking ship
[0:25:33] <This_is_Marco> yo what
[0:25:34] <%starotter70> oh
[0:25:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> @alcors_wisdom But he likes lacrosse so he is immediately untrustworthy. Like Stifler in American Pie.
[0:25:35] <%RadicalPirate> yooo
[0:25:36] <deviljhojho_> huh
[0:25:38] <+Dragon_Bilbo> Hello Pat!
[0:25:38] <+griffball13> so i grinded off stream
[0:25:38] <%Kataguro> It's apparently Armed
[0:25:39] <Ner234> Explosions?
[0:25:39] <@lewdskeletor13> Nice
[0:25:40] <%ShineTheDiamond> NIce
[0:25:40] <count_bob> "Fucked around a little bit"
[0:25:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> "I grinded off screen"
[0:25:41] <sileo_patronus> "found"
[0:25:41] <derap41> btw please do not tinker with unique weapons before you reach science 100
[0:25:43] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat What's your build? I can attest how broken stealing/lock picking is
[0:25:45] <+FrostMass22> @griffball13 I don't think the journal is a readable item
[0:25:46] <Tucker0603> NICE
[0:25:47] <tigerfang86> GRINDING OFF SCREEN
[0:25:54] <Monkeyweed21> no there isnt
[0:25:54] <thelonechris> "I did some grinding off screen."
[0:25:55] <%starotter70> Yeah?
[0:25:58] <count_bob> Very good.
[0:25:59] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat is knowing the level cap spoilers?
[0:25:59] <%DracaenaLeaf> Did you grenade offscreen tho
[0:26:00] <%CJett92> s'good
[0:26:01] <%Kataguro> It's good
[0:26:02] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Grindin' and Scrappin'
[0:26:02] <tigerfang86> HALL WUGGING
[0:26:02] <%RupanSen> apatBig difference
[0:26:02] <+0range_> ggood
[0:26:03] <+griffball13> it's pretty good
[0:26:03] <%Quigsies> Doing great
[0:26:03] <Ner234> Looks great
[0:26:05] <%ShineTheDiamond> @King_Wolf_Rigger Are you surprised? He does this with every game Lmao
[0:26:05] <%SomeSageAdvice> looks pretty good
[0:26:05] <%alcors_wisdom> oh poor babu pat knows not of how big the galaxy is
[0:26:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Stream si trash
[0:26:06] <austyn_do> looks good
[0:26:07] <%terribleusername> looks good
[0:26:08] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat did you see the Respec machine on your ship? You keep passing it by so I'm worried
[0:26:10] <derap41> the cost reduction of tinkering doesn't activate retroactibly
[0:26:11] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it is 30
[0:26:13] <cherrycottontail> 30
[0:26:13] <%Kataguro> 30, right?
[0:26:14] <+griffball13> 30
[0:26:14] <person181> 30
[0:26:15] <%ape_hawk> 30
[0:26:15] <%Big_Dream> 30
[0:26:16] <$PaleBloodInk> 30
[0:26:16] <KasiCrafter> Seems fine to me.
[0:26:18] <@lewdskeletor13> I never use that ladder, just jump on the boxes LUL
[0:26:20] <+FrostMass22> What even is a science weapon? I haven't ever seen one in 10hrs of playing.
[0:26:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> 30 is the cap?!
[0:26:23] <sileo_patronus> of course it's 30
[0:26:26] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Do you also fiddle with what Twitch server you connect to as well?
[0:26:26] <%Quigsies> Seems fair for this kind of game
[0:26:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ShineTheDiamond Not at all surprised lol.
[0:26:30] <jcflyguy> Oof. So much for maxing multiple skills
[0:26:31] <%Kataguro> You get more perks if you get Flaws, so it's fine
[0:26:32] <Ner234> FeelsBadMna
[0:26:37] <Ner234> FeelsBadMan
[0:26:38] <+blitzrush1200> That sounds really low
[0:26:39] <Trillex56> ladders should have fast descent in this
[0:26:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> But we are Hawthorne now
[0:26:45] <$Mighty_observer> 30 seems to be cap for alot of games
[0:26:50] <+griffball13> SKYNET
[0:26:52] <%StaceMcGate> 30, but you'll easily get it, Main quest drops off ridiculous amounts of EXP even if you skip side quests
[0:26:52] <%Shoosler> @FrostMass22 there's a shrink ray gun
[0:26:59] <tigerfang86> TOAST
[0:27:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> SHE'S A WITCH
[0:27:01] <%DracaenaLeaf> she blinks a lot
[0:27:03] <mield916> wait, I'm further along than pat? ive played only 3 times
[0:27:04] <%starotter70> I wish I had one of those
[0:27:10] <%ShineTheDiamond> I would not be surprised to find out Pat has already beaten the game on another profile.
[0:27:10] <+griffball13> this is like edi from mass effect
[0:27:11] <Gorgen> He totally fucked his ship
[0:27:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THIS BITCH USED TO BE BASIC
[0:27:13] <tigerfang86> HE MADE A WAIFU
[0:27:14] <%miguelrod777> he fucked his ship
[0:27:20] <%Kataguro> OH NO
[0:27:20] <+twohitgood> that personality thing sounds very ominous.
[0:27:21] <%thetrashman_sc> YO PAT FUCK THIS SHIP
[0:27:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> Who??
[0:27:23] <darcfowler1995> ship is best girl
[0:27:23] <42nfl19> Does ADA look like that cop woman in edgewater?
[0:27:23] <transporterthesequel> HUH
[0:27:26] <+griffball13> TAKE CONTROL
[0:27:26] <$Mighty_observer> sbfpLiam
[0:27:28] <%TheAsianAvenger96> DLC?
[0:27:31] <%ShineTheDiamond> Ohhhhhh nooooo.
[0:27:33] <%CJett92> Yo, Liam is in this game?
[0:27:35] <cherrycottontail> "what, no, I'm not sentient/sapient *visible sweating*"
[0:27:37] <SGrim> Ada's your rebound target then?
[0:27:38] <cureneckbeard> Ada is a clever name because it's the name of the first female computer programmer, and also the name of a programming language.
[0:27:39] <$Mighty_observer> redacted sbfpVita
[0:27:39] <nademonkey1100> can you fuck the ship though ?
[0:27:40] <transporterthesequel> WHAT ADA has a freakin backstory!?
[0:27:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FUCK YOUR SHIP, RIGHT IN THE EXHAUST PORT

[0:28:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> UP ON THE CATWALK
[0:28:02] <%CJett92> now left
[0:28:03] <mrcelab> left
[0:28:03] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat it costs 500 first time to respec, addition 500 each time. 2nd floor by engine room
[0:28:03] <%Big_Dream> Respec machine above
[0:28:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Probably in the break room
[0:28:04] <Trillex56> up ladder above workbench
[0:28:04] <%ShineTheDiamond> In her room
[0:28:06] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat in the corner above the bench
[0:28:07] <+TheSaintJohn> colder
[0:28:08] <%Big_Dream> turna round
[0:28:08] <%alcors_wisdom> she wanders
[0:28:11] <%Run44forrest> you forgot her on earth 2
[0:28:12] <%Valdorick> Yo, but does she tell us that she loves the sight of humans on their knees? Kappa
[0:28:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Or fixing the engines
[0:28:14] <%Kataguro> She's Calibrating
[0:28:18] <@lewdskeletor13> They wander around the ship
[0:28:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> She looks like she's about to kill an Alien Queen
[0:28:28] <%honeyman18> Cheap respec
[0:28:30] <+griffball13> out the airlock with you
[0:28:31] <reonome> is she garrus
[0:28:33] <+TheBobulus> It's really weird how 'go away' is the first option
[0:28:36] <%Run44forrest> why would that be the default option
[0:28:37] <%ape_hawk> does pat know who voices parvati?
[0:28:39] <+blitzrush1200> She's actually so sad when you tell her to go
[0:28:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> nifty
[0:28:42] <%ShineTheDiamond> OoooOOOooooo!
[0:28:43] <+chaumiester> I like the Not Power Armor everyone is wearing
[0:28:43] <%Tearonex> REPEC BUDDY
[0:28:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> So you just brain yourself with a hammer and reset everything?
[0:28:45] <$Timesteel> I beat the game and never even found this LUL
[0:28:46] <tigerfang86> oh
[0:28:47] <%StaceMcGate> Pat knows it is Ashely Burch
[0:28:48] <SparkAfterDark> diablooooooooooo
[0:28:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Respecc yoself gurrrrrl
[0:28:53] <+griffball13> this is always nice
[0:28:54] <cureneckbeard> That's just a sewing machine.
[0:28:55] <KasiCrafter> A LITERAL Respec machine.
[0:29:00] <cherrycottontail> increases by 500 every time
[0:29:04] <%ShineTheDiamond> That's hella cheap
[0:29:07] <person181> time to become below avrage
[0:29:07] <%PauliusMaximus> wait really?, i played the whole game without finding that XD
[0:29:07] <+chaumiester> Is it Ashley Burch?
[0:29:19] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you can't respec your initial stats you assigned, just skills and perks
[0:29:25] <Ner234> It's a bit worrying that the "Kick them off" options is just there. I can't imagine how many clicked that on accident. Does it give you the option to back out?
[0:29:29] <%Quigsies> Lab then groundbreaker
[0:29:32] <@lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat you can stop by Phineas’ lab for a free thing
[0:29:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fly your spaceship into the sun. That's how you get the True Ending
[0:29:34] <Trillex56> lab
[0:29:34] <%dalmek> You should go to Monarch Kappa
[0:29:34] <%cvp5127> dlc land
[0:29:44] <$floralkami> @PauliusMaximus you maybe should explore more often
[0:29:44] <%thetrashman_sc> go to the lab
[0:29:45] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat cascadia is full of good loot and EXP
[0:29:45] <cherrycottontail> Definitely go to monarch
[0:29:46] <jcflyguy> But where's Giant's Deep tho
[0:29:49] <mield916> monarch
[0:29:49] <%Valdorick> Awful lot of Greek naming going on here...
[0:29:49] <cureneckbeard> how come is a jupiter and a saturn
[0:29:50] <%RupanSen> I'd say Tatooine
[0:29:51] <nademonkey1100> Typhon better be a fucking plague planet
[0:29:53] <tigerfang86> ROCK
[0:29:54] <%starotter70> Not until the dark hour
[0:29:56] <Mrbaconator> monarch
[0:29:57] <%AncelDeLambert> you CANNOT go to Phineas' lab
[0:29:57] <%StaceMcGate> Cascadia is totally SAFE at your level
[0:29:58] <%terribleusername> shit's locked
[0:29:58] <%cvp5127> baby baby baby baby
[0:29:59] <$Mighty_observer> Doctor who?

[0:30:01] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> why does tartarus have a lock on it
[0:30:01] <%Kataguro> You will die on Monarch
[0:30:02] <This_is_Marco> @Ner234 I swear to god I've hit that option too many times on accident
[0:30:03] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat you can go to scylla

[0:30:31] <osiris1260> Monarch is Quarry Junctin
[0:30:31] <%Kataguro> Go to the lab
[0:30:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YOU CAN GO TO MONARCH, DONT LISTEN TO CHAT
[0:30:33] <Conyst> cmon Pat use words
[0:30:33] <%valriot> Indivisible? yeah I know it sucks
[0:30:35] <cureneckbeard> visitable.
[0:30:38] <Ner234> @This_is_Marco Man that must suck. I wonder why they did it like that?
[0:30:40] <This_is_Marco> Just B-line directly to the Sun
[0:30:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> MONARCH
[0:30:42] <@lewdskeletor13> You’ll die on Monarch
[0:30:44] <LilMKatsu> words how do they work man
[0:30:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> taste Monarch
[0:30:48] <%lottsoflottie> 43 raiders from lottsoflottie have joined! 
[0:30:48] <Mrbaconator> Monarch is fine
[0:30:55] <%ShineTheDiamond> @LilMKatsu Magic.
[0:30:59] <Gieron667> @XeroSigmaPrime he cant land on it dude ...
[0:31:02] <%Takreth> raiding party monkaS
[0:31:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, the game tells you pretty clearly you'll get eaten if you head to Monarch. Hence why I have not done so
[0:31:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> MONARCH IS AMAZING
[0:31:04] <%StaceMcGate> You cannot go to Typhon, Olympus and Eridanos. There are additional places not yet on the map you can visit

[0:31:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Go to Korriban my dude. Install the mod to let you take Bastila so she can blow your cover
[0:31:12] <This_is_Marco> @Ner234 I have no idea, I mean I like that you can just do it.. but its too available LUL
[0:31:12] <SparkAfterDark> Don't go to monarch yet, chat just wants you to waste your time and it's not gonna be that funny
[0:31:13] <nomos42> Yay, more lefties!
[0:31:14] <%Kataguro> Somewhat correct
[0:31:15] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Boooooooooooooooooooooooo
[0:31:16] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat HIGHLY suggest groundbreaker because it will give you reasons to visit the other planets
[0:31:19] <cherrycottontail> Did you know the speedrun of this game is down to 30 minutes?
[0:31:19] <Gieron667> HE CANT LAND ON MONARCH YET YOU IMBACILS
[0:31:21] <mrcelab> On groundbreaker youll get other missions to other planets, dont you worry
[0:31:23] <%starotter70> No don't raid us! We're weak and easily defeated
[0:31:23] <%honeyman18> Phineas' lab rules as a quick stop
[0:31:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Gieron667 lol wut, ofcourse you can. They just dont recommend it...

[0:31:35] <Mrbaconator> @SparkAfterDark i went there at level 8 and killed every enemy i found just fine
[0:31:36] <%StaceMcGate> @SparkAfterDark Pat getting killed by lvl 25 raptors is hilarious tho

[1:20:18] <derap41> @jcflyguy the bonuses doesn't act retroactively so if you tinker it at low levels you won't get the 90% reduction nor the cap even after you got science 100

[1:28:22] <derap41> not worth
[1:28:23] <%BlackMage66652> I can't wait till Pat meets the best character
[1:28:31] <NeroInfinite> It barel did anything
[1:28:35] <%TheStarvingGood> "light" armor
[1:28:38] <VERDAXY> himself?
[1:28:46] <derap41> Looks like the blue guys in planetside 2
[1:28:46] <%bread_assassin> @BlackMage66652 Guy with the hat?
[1:28:50] <RyanTheRecluse> That’s fine, means I managed to catch the stream before the best character on Groundbreaker
[1:28:57] <%BlackMage66652> @bread_assassin Correct
[1:29:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Sure you can, just get good
[1:29:03] <$GoogleyGareth> If they're not looking at you you can take it I think
[1:29:03] <Atheistpreacher> Hat guy is pretty great.
[1:29:03] <%RubberFistFight> @BlackMage66652 oh man I think I know who you mean. My entire stream/playthrough ground to a halt while I asked him ALL THE QUESTIONS.
[1:29:07] <%Dr_Mooose> monkaS
[1:29:10] <senfood> Because Patron spit hot fire
[1:29:12] <arkv01> how can they lick your eyeballs if they're not close
[1:29:15] <Monkeyweed21> why does pat speak in ebonics when he steals
[1:29:23] <konarius> did he shoot the hotels owner and looted the safes yet?
[1:29:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> BURNING HAMMER
[1:29:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> YO! give that to yo gurl Cheesey
[1:29:32] <Atheistpreacher> @RubberFistFight how could you not?
[1:29:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cmonBruh
[1:29:33] <lordsdb> Is it just me or does almost every video game want you to rob everyone you possible can.
[1:29:43] <%StaceMcGate> Companions have no preference for weapons
[1:29:43] <joedatuous> of course
[1:29:46] <senfood> Patron Patron Patron Patron Patron because I spit hot fire
[1:29:48] <+blitzrush1200> 1h for her character that uses 2h coming up
[1:29:49] <Gieron667> doesnt matte what hamded
[1:29:50] <arkv01> thats a creepy pet name for your peepee
[1:29:53] <derap41> I gave him a flame thrower
[1:29:54] <joedatuous> stealing is the best and everyone should do it
[1:29:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> @lordsdb Of course. Stealing is fun!
[1:29:55] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat here's a tip, INSPECT Unique weapons to get some details
[1:30:01] <Monkeyweed21> the hammer is better
[1:30:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah I didn't see any melee/ranged skills in their builds
[1:30:02] <$Afterman_> her default melee wep is a 2h
[1:30:04] <derap41> so he could PURGE IN HOLY FIRE
[1:30:10] <%BlackMage66652> @RubberFistFight I want to free him so much
[1:30:14] <arkv01> now parv wears the pants
[1:30:24] <Monkeyweed21> he hammer is stronger
[1:30:27] <konarius> weapons only matter for their special attacks, which don't matter
[1:30:40] <%demegodz> Parv is the Paladin of the group, huh?
[1:30:42] <gonzy92> give them the shrink ray so they can shrink stuff while you attack
[1:30:52] <sirrice77> jump on t;hose crates
[1:30:53] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Personally, I gave all my companions the science weapons as they are debuff weapons
[1:30:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> JUMP ON THE BEDS

[1:35:29] <+sunriser696> thats right ms steve, just walk away
[1:35:31] <GoldySUP> The rep decrease needs to be more
[1:35:37] <$GoogleyGareth> Those checks should really be higher
[1:35:38] <%ghostofreznov> He tricked himself into thinking it was a stealth game & being detected was a game over
[1:35:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> JUST KILL THEM
[1:35:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> There should be npcs that hate you if you even steal ONE thing your whole playthrough
[1:35:54] <joedatuous> its fine there is no way for it to go down
[1:35:58] <+AlDavisBoil> Lying in this game is the best
[1:36:02] <joedatuous> so it cant be too rough
[1:36:03] <%bread_assassin> Stealing is totally non-consequential in this game.
[1:36:06] <%honeyman18> blast plamsa!!
[1:36:10] <%RubberFistFight> holy fucking CRIT batman
[1:36:11] <sectorquack> big number

[1:36:43] <+Estuko> Max is so cool
[1:36:44] <joedatuous> he's so cool!
[1:36:44] <%Comradeiota> that's
[1:36:44] <+Freaknick1> Vicor has some moves
[1:36:45] <%StaceMcGate> Fully charged Plasma rifle + headshot + no armor + crit = 3k
[1:36:45] <theamazingroberto> slow mo supercharge to the back of a janitor's head, tries to real time face to face against a big mech
[1:36:47] <%Comradeiota> an incredible line
[1:36:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Tha's a good confession
[1:36:49] <$floralkami> FUCK IT UP
[1:36:49] <%RubberFistFight> He's possibly got the thing that massively increases damage from sneaking, plus some weapon upgrades.
[1:36:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is Vicar his name or his station?
[1:36:52] <Gieron667> pat fight by not using his weapons
[1:36:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Warrior Priest

[1:37:05] <%Rumbutt> It's BETTER VATS
[1:37:05] <Gieron667> pat dont know how to shoot gun
[1:37:06] <@lewdskeletor13> Vicar is a title
[1:37:07] <+Javaa01> And you have to aim, by yourself
[1:37:08] <derap41> Light assult rifle pisses me off
[1:37:08] <LodiFrostbeard> it's bullet time
[1:37:08] <%waddledoops> theres a science weapon in here
[1:37:10] <tigerfang86> It's THE WORLD
[1:37:11] <%InugamiTheHound> so the same real time vats like in fallout 76
[1:37:12] <LodiFrostbeard> you have to aim
[1:37:14] <%bread_assassin> So more like Fallout 76 VATS?
[1:37:14] <tigerfang86> but less good
[1:37:15] <+rj1771> This game is literally New Vegas: but 30x better.
[1:37:16] <grayjammer> Realtimestop
[1:37:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Legally distinct VATS
[1:37:18] <%dekkitout> Correction* It's STANDO POWA

[1:37:24] <%Run44forrest> so where are we now and why are we killing everyone

[1:38:03] <%TamsynRRD> TamsynRRD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Hey Pat! We sadly lost our cat of 12 years to cancer this week. Chloe. However, we've welcomed in a 3 month old solid black kitten named Boo. He's a needy, devious, manipulative, jealous, mischievous little gremlin and I love him.
[1:38:03] <%ArcanumMBD> 66 damage per swing but slow speed
[1:38:03] <%maskofmichael> Gaboid Cleaver
[1:38:03] <+sunriser696> is more like mass effect 1, new vegas and kotor had a baby
[1:38:04] <%waddledoops> find the science hammer
[1:38:06] <%Kataguro> It's a generic
[1:38:07] <%Rumbutt> Its THROBBING BLADE
[1:38:07] <timetraveller2000> Every Supernova playthrough I’ve seen so far has gotten their companions perms killed by this point LUL
[1:38:07] <derap41> its a normal weapoin
[1:38:07] <lotharrio> Two handed weapons have lower DPS but higher damage on hit.
[1:38:08] <+gimmickypizza> meechPls
[1:38:09] <ZE_Count> its a cool axe
[1:38:11] <RyanTheRecluse> Pat’s gonna start running out of inventory space now
[1:38:11] <$dmdyne99> Vibrating eh?
[1:38:11] <gothas> bleed proc?
[1:38:12] <%chambatron> @BlackMage66652 thanks
[1:38:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Aye, the cookie king himself.
[1:38:14] <lotharrio> So they get through armor better.
[1:38:14] <sectorquack> science hammer
[1:38:16] <Mister_McDerp> does bleed
[1:38:20] <derap41> its not unique its just a geneeric axre
[1:38:20] <NeroInfinite> It's anormal axe
[1:38:21] <%honeyman18> your melee sucks
[1:38:22] <LodiFrostbeard> level difference pat
[1:38:22] <$Afterman_> thor hammer more dps
[1:38:24] <%CJett92> Lot slower, but hits harder per swing
[1:38:25] <%Dr_Mooose> but it looks cool
[1:38:26] <%Comradeiota> what level is the axe
[1:38:26] <lethallylactic> What level is the weapon?
[1:38:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> LOOK FOR THE ACTUAL GOOD HaMMER
[1:38:28] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I only caught part of the podcast today due to classes. I just want to say re: Symmetra, that as somebody on the spectrum I'm super offended that they just tokenized her as autistic for woke points.
[1:38:28] <fatalDestiny> It's also twice the level of the vibroaxe
[1:38:30] <%ArcanumMBD> it's almost like some weapons are better than others
[1:38:30] <%Comradeiota> yeah the hammer is 12
[1:38:30] <%Niney_Who> She has better melee
[1:38:31] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat DPS is deceptive Pat
[1:38:32] <+ShogunNoonto> tow mod slots?
[1:38:38] <+ShogunNoonto> two
[1:38:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie That's a hell of pull. Nice one.
[1:38:40] <%RubberFistFight> @lotharrio well yeah because they're slower.
[1:38:42] <cureneckbeard> DPS = Deceptive Pat System
[1:38:42] <mr_gunn> But is the hammer an axe? I don’t think so
[1:38:42] <ZE_Count> you can level items reamembe rthat
[1:38:44] <derap41> scrap low level sell high level
[1:38:45] <+AlDavisBoil> Melee good for party members
[1:38:48] <%ArcanumMBD> dont upgrade it
[1:38:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger Thank you.
[1:38:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That isn't the special weapon yo
[1:38:58] <derap41> Its a waste
[1:38:59] <%waddledoops> its trash
[1:39:00] <sectorquack> just give it to max
[1:39:00] <%dalmek> It's a normal weapon m8
[1:39:01] <%CJett92> explore a bit
[1:39:01] <%Niney_Who> It's expensive
[1:39:03] <%LiquidShake83> SHOOT IT
[1:39:04] <Monkeyweed21> generic crap
[1:39:05] <+Deadbulky> Not worth the money
[1:39:12] <%Comradeiota> You'd be better off finding a higher level axe
[1:39:12] <+blitzrush1200> Tinker costs less the more engineer points
[1:39:19] <%Comradeiota> Than spending the money to upgrade it
[1:39:20] <RyanTheRecluse> Science 100 perk is busted for upgrading
[1:39:21] <%TheStarvingGood> just trash it
[1:39:21] <lotharrio> Upgrading is only worth it when you max out the Engineer skill.
[1:39:25] <%honeyman18> tinker gets cheaper with science
[1:39:28] <%BlackMage66652> @AngriestPat Keep exploring is why
[1:39:28] <Gieron667> just keep exploring this area
[1:39:30] <osiris1260> DPS is different per character
[1:39:31] <derap41> Tinker should be saved until level 100 science
[1:39:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd love an rpg that has you play as a companion to the Real Protagonist. Satire ensues.
[1:39:36] <LodiFrostbeard> it gets fucking expensive to upgrade after a while, it's easier to just get new stuff
[1:39:37] <cureneckbeard> Put luck to 50
[1:39:38] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat it's not worth it to upgrade legendary weapons btw, they scale horribly and can't put mods on them
[1:39:39] <gothas> Specialty items cant be upgraded?
[1:39:43] <%bread_assassin> @lotharrio You mean Science?
[1:39:45] <derap41> its a huge waste otherwise because you'll pick up higer level gear
[1:39:54] <%ArcanumMBD> thats why dont upgrade it. shiny science weapon
[1:39:58] <Gieron667> there ya go
[1:40:00] <NeroInfinite> PRismatic hammer

[1:59:24] <%RubberFistFight> I love how the presence of ship radiators, and the fact that when they break down the ship gets HOT, shows that the writers did their research. Disposing of excess heat in space is difficult since there's no air, so convection and conduction don't happen, only radiation. And that's super inefficient at disposing of heat.

[2:21:07] <Us3rr> Max evolves a bit if you follow his story as well
[2:21:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Really
[2:21:15] <tigerfang86> MOON GANG: WE HELP GRANNIES AND BURN DOWN COMPANIES
[2:21:17] <+MakotoPB> Pat is getting hot and bothered. Is it the Groundbreaker or Gladys?
[2:21:20] <TDAWS_MP132> and better health regen

[2:21:22] <derap41> oh
[2:21:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Too bad there's no unarmed skills, but I guess it wouldn't make sense
[2:21:29] <ianabstract> It's the best hat in the game
[2:21:35] <Us3rr> what's wrong with a Matrix nod?
[2:21:39] <$Mighty_observer> Granny gave you a basket of "cookies"
[2:21:40] <Gieron667> weeeeeeelp i sold this helmet
[2:21:45] <+MrN64> sneak is really worth leveling up for pickpocketing
[2:21:45] <Gieron667> fuck me i guewss
[2:21:45] <joylent_blue> up your lockpick, its great
[2:22:01] <%ghostofreznov> That empty moon stare...
[2:22:01] <Datsanegg> More dialog to rip out people's secrets?
[2:22:05] <%honeyman18> SCIENCE IS DAMAGE
[2:22:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat is overwhelmed by choice
[2:22:08] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You are gonna give so many children nightmares with that moon head
[2:22:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> de fense
[2:22:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> thum tump tump
[2:22:19] <RyanTheRecluse> Lock pick is a good choice
[2:22:19] <ZE_Count> Tech?
[2:22:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Better lockpick and stealth could help a lot, but I dunno bout shit
[2:22:23] <fIashman92> Guns, melee, and defense are useless statss
[2:22:23] <%nicos143> I put all my points in dialogue in the hopes of cool options later
[2:22:26] <joedatuous> go heavy on persuade.
[2:22:30] <+Solutha> Should get defense for dodge at least
[2:22:32] <@lewdskeletor13> Moonman is the Vault Boy of this game basically
[2:22:40] <%Zereaux> sneaky moon man
[2:22:43] <joedatuous> it throws 100 persuade checks earlier then you think
[2:22:46] <+MakotoPB> stealth for more robbery
[2:22:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> science makes everything better
[2:23:02] <RyanTheRecluse> If you want to steal stuff then go stealth
[2:23:08] <Us3rr> lockpick is really what you want tho
[2:23:09] <%magnusxp> I just noticed something do you not have twitch channel points enabled Pat are you going to enable those anytime soon now that you have functional internet?
[2:23:16] <@commanderclaw> Pickpocket is mostly useful for rich people and quest items
[2:23:17] <fIashman92> Get inspiration up to 60 as soon as possible
[2:23:26] <alapazam> hacking is poo
[2:23:33] <+blitzrush1200> Lockpick gets really high later so you'll ned it like 40ish atleast
[2:23:34] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Persuade its almost busted
[2:23:36] <joedatuous> wut you can pickpocket?
[2:23:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> What does Inspiration at 60 do?
[2:23:47] <Gieron667> he did good
[2:23:49] <jcflyguy> Pickpocket is OP
[2:23:49] <alapazam> too few things to hack
[2:23:55] <Sulliman34> how far is he i dont wanna get spilerd
[2:24:03] <joedatuous> how can you pickpocket?
[2:24:05] <%sectorquack> oh geez
[2:24:06] <%bread_assassin> Hacking had very few opportunities compared to lockpick
[2:24:07] <%MakotoPB> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:24:11] <alapazam> @sulliman34 left first planet
[2:24:18] <ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Tech Tech Tech
[2:24:19] <Sulliman34> oh so he aint too far at all
[2:24:21] <joedatuous> persuade!
[2:24:21] <@lewdskeletor13> @sulliman34 He’s just doing the Groundbreaker
[2:24:24] <Gieron667> i say go lockpicking
[2:24:25] <fIashman92> @King_Wolf_Rigger Doubles the stat gains from your companions, essentially meaning you get 60 free stats points bonuses
[2:24:26] <joedatuous> its so useful
[2:24:27] <%sectorquack> dialog
[2:24:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Sulliman34 He's on Groundbreaker for the first time
[2:24:38] <jcflyguy> Science probably
[2:24:40] <Sulliman34> thanks yall
[2:24:40] <%Kataguro> Tech makes you smart
[2:24:50] <RyanTheRecluse> If you don’t have the ability to buy mag picks then get that
[2:24:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Medical is pretty good for the micxed heals
[2:24:54] <pectusumbra> science probably has story options
[2:24:57] <fIashman92> Get inspiration up to 60
[2:24:57] <%sectorquack> dialog solves so many problems
[2:24:59] <Sulliman34> science weapons are maybe strong
[2:24:59] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat tech is really good for a lot of skill checks
[2:25:00] <CurrySauseBandit> Does Pat even have a Science gun yet?
[2:25:03] <joedatuous> science for crafting
[2:25:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @flashman92 That's dang awesome.
[2:25:12] <pectusumbra> personally I'd say stealth
[2:25:12] <Us3rr> @rumtumtugnutz did he talk to Felix yet?
[2:25:14] <Sulliman34> oh wow inspo60 is strong
[2:25:14] <flyingavocad0s> Lock picking reduces the number of picks you need
[2:25:18] <%MalekDracarus> For tinkering
[2:25:20] <pectusumbra> the lockpicks keep tripping you up
[2:25:24] <%honeyman18> damage for elements goes up with science
[2:25:28] <Zooperton> jermaIQ
[2:25:32] <joedatuous> tinkering is useful
[2:25:33] <@commanderclaw> I'm a fan of medical, better heals and more slots
[2:25:33] <%AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat you excited for Yorha Dark Apocalypse tomorrow?
[2:25:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat lol so the voice actress / motion capture actress from RE2 for Claire (Stephanie Panisello) is playing RE2R for her first playthrough right now. LUL Surreal.
[2:25:37] <arkv01> but the low iq choices are so powerful
[2:25:40] <joedatuous> lockpicking isn't the best
[2:25:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> @us3r Not sure, I was away for a bit
[2:25:42] <RushUnplugged> science boosts all energy damage, not just science weapons
[2:25:52] <@commanderclaw> Vape a beer
[2:25:52] <%GalacticaPhanto> apatHoldon
[2:25:54] <%sectorquack> vodka

[2:33:23] <derap41> by my caclulations we're going ot have seen everthing in a week
[2:33:23] <SparkAfterDark> yes steal all those consumables you will never ever ever use
[2:33:31] <%bevyrage> i glanced over and see two moonmen watching pat stealing stuff
[2:33:36] <Sokumotanaka> "Take everything, leave nothing behind!"
[2:33:39] <%bevyrage> so this is a good game from what i'm seeing
[2:33:46] <seniormeatbox> @AngriestPat do you still plan to burn everything down
[2:33:47] <+CanonHusbando> theres something still in the backroom
[2:33:48] <joedatuous> you're a bad man pat

[2:34:05] <+rj1771> The parody Obsidian is playing off is that Bobby Kotick rules the universe. He wants to install a culture of fear among his employees (actually Bobby "Stop Putting Devil Horns On My Pics" Kotick)
[2:34:05] <Finakala> But Pat, how do you piss in a toilet that has no door
[2:34:09] <a_mad_dragon> BUMBLE KING
[2:34:10] <Ner234> It would be hilarious if there was some hidden Karma for stealing so much shit.
[2:34:11] <joedatuous> LUL
[2:34:13] <reiju_22> cirLaugh
[2:34:13] <arkv01> fill the door with piss
[2:34:22] <%RubberFistFight> Pat just used "[LIE] Nothing at all." on chat.
[2:34:23] <derap41> @Ner234 shush
[2:34:26] <%ghostofreznov> Time for Pat to make the bucket dump noise with his peepee
[2:34:30] <seniormeatbox> Is the entire reason why Paige cosplayed as Undyne because she's horny for papyrus
[2:34:36] <+anchovypositive> do you gotta put your leadership skills to 60 to be able to use your companion skill chat??

[2:36:06] <derap41> @seniormeatbox he only ruined the life of the most depressing person ever
[2:36:08] <joylent_blue> the song is Bootloop by F1NG3RS
[2:36:15] <seniormeatbox> Did pat kill the tuna foreman or did his 5 seconds of having a soul turn into a 10 miunutes of having a soul
[2:36:19] <+kefkloud> thanks!!
[2:36:39] <arkv01> OHGOD PAT YOUR DRENCHED IN PISS
[2:36:44] <derap41> Although I guess his life was already ruined

[2:44:24] <%heyitsbrian> @Kataguro no ragrets indeed
[2:44:25] <seniormeatbox> @AngriestPat are you going to play Mystery of Castle Superbeast when it comes out?
[2:44:28] <Rosy_Joan> unlike Fallout 4 it doesnt need music to inflate its cock
[2:44:35] <heartlesshealer> No radio because it distracts from production
[2:44:46] <%MelBrooksKA> I wouldn't be surprised if there is no radio because the cost of the licenses
[2:44:52] <derap41> Bless you
[2:44:53] <%heyitsbrian> BLESS YOU
[2:44:57] <%SomeSageAdvice> bless you
[2:44:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The Fallout Radio also costs money.
[2:44:58] <seniormeatbox> Let the emlo spores in
[2:44:58] <$Mighty_observer> mystery of what now?
[2:44:58] <joylent_blue> BlessRNG bless

[2:45:47] <%ssjklyco> It will play better than Fallout 76
[2:45:48] <arkv01> we're going to turn it into a porngame
[2:45:49] <%chiluzza> needs to be a porn horror game
[2:45:49] <SparkAfterDark> no radio because it's not actually trying to conjure a super specific era, and if you added radio it would tie it down to one. As is it got an old fashioned feel but it's not actually tied to an era

[3:11:47] <+v1Ables> @AngriestPat I highly reccomend keeping ALL your +1 Mind consumables, as they will boost your dialogue, hack, lockpick for when your close enough to need them
[3:11:49] <derap41> Finally
[3:11:54] <@lewdskeletor13> A lot of the consumables in this game feel like they’d be more useful on Supernova

[4:06:26] <StromkoPenguin> They're greasy because of the corporate machine
[4:06:28] <%RubberFistFight> @Sokumotanaka honestly? It's the former. It's a bit of bashfulness wrapped up in a bit of hero worship. Everyone's familiar with that feeling.
[4:06:38] <Us3rr> it's just something in a different language
[4:06:52] <T_Sasquatch> Seriously how much water do you think is available LUL

[4:09:27] <%honeyman18> even damage
[4:09:28] <derap41> There are some rare units with plasma resistance
[4:09:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat Plasma is super good for people, I know that much
[4:09:34] <%dekkitout> Kinetic ammo- something something Destiny Reference...
[4:09:35] <LSether> Some things are resistant to certain damage types
[4:09:37] <fIashman92> Game is easy enough that it doesn't matter
[4:09:38] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Nothing is resistant to normal damage
[4:09:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Statuses can be resisted Kinetic is general damage
[4:09:41] <%honeyman18> plasma fucks
[4:09:41] <%Piemen99> It's a real pretty gun
[4:09:43] <%PauliusMaximus> the codex tells you
[4:09:45] <%RubberFistFight> @LostCire I mentioned before that I fucking LOVE that the writers did their research into how heat and spaceships work IRL. Disposing of waste heat in space is extremely difficult since there's no air to carry it away and nothing touching the ship to draw it off. All they got is radiation which is super inefficient.
[4:09:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Kinetic keeps you from carrying around 5 weapons in your inventory
[4:09:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> plasma does bonus to fleshies
[4:09:47] <+RevyMarcus> nothing is resistant to kinetic ammo
[4:09:47] <%TONYOO101> plasmas bad against armor iirc
[4:09:51] <LSether> Plasma works well against animals.
[4:09:54] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Bigger mag is good for that gun
[4:09:56] <Dakuu75> LOL the guy that was stuck in the shitter for litteral DAYS
[4:10:02] <heartlesshealer> I think that pistol with the red pew pew beam from long ago was plasma
[4:10:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Toilet man!
[4:10:06] <+neversawme321> don't sweat about it, just use what you pick up and choose your flavor
[4:10:08] <LodiFrostbeard> @LSether not agains mantids
[4:10:10] <Junkles> plasma is bad against bug
[4:10:13] <Needwagon_for_speedwagon> LOCKED IN THE SHITTER
[4:10:13] <derap41> His current carer is washing toilets
[4:10:18] <joedatuous> wow its almost like you have an effect on the world
[4:10:24] <Gieron667> @AngriestPat there's an entry in the Codex explaining every damage type and what they are good against
[4:10:31] <joedatuous> cough cough fall out cough cough
[4:10:31] <42nfl19> Is there a reason that the talk button is also the raise gun?
[4:10:34] <Monkeyweed21> Shipa town
[4:10:39] <%mistspade> pat walk out the door
[4:10:45] <LSether> @LodiFrostbeard Eh. it works well enough on their weak point, i think it has less armor or something there.
[4:10:46] <Dakuu75> is there no intercom system, radio or phones on a space ship that he could've used to call for help?
[4:10:48] <+MrN64> dont forget to talk to parvati lol
[4:10:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> its these little uneeded but good details that make the game fun
[4:10:51] <heartlesshealer> probably combat
[4:10:57] <Splatterfest> cant spoil myself more
[4:11:01] <heartlesshealer> damage types
[4:11:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Dakuu75 not in the toilet
[4:11:03] <%honeyman18> last one in symbols
[4:11:03] <%wsintai> Damage types, its up thewre
[4:11:04] <Monkeyweed21> damage types
[4:11:05] <heartlesshealer> under critical
[4:11:05] <%TONYOO101> its under combat
[4:11:06] <%wsintai> nvm
[4:11:06] <%sectorquack> pat walk outside
[4:11:07] <reddpop_> As captain of a space ship, do you get to customize the interior at all? This is big important for me
[4:11:08] <pectusumbra> damage types yeah
[4:11:16] <DefaultSettiings> is this where the man who hates toilets resides
[4:11:21] <%RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc it's amazing what decent worldbuilding and making the world feel "lived in", and that things happen when you're not around, can do for a game, isn't it.
[4:11:24] <Dakuu75> @doc_ock_rokc lol
[4:11:31] <%dekkitout> Mantisaurs are Dethclaws, got it- clear as the sky
[4:11:35] <+neversawme321> so yeah
[4:11:41] <+neversawme321> kinetic is ehhh
[4:11:41] <@lewdskeletor13> @reddpop_ Not customize per se, but your ship will be decorated based on choices you make/things you find in the world
[4:11:52] <Gieron667> yea kinetic is trash
[4:11:59] <LodiFrostbeard> he hasn't been to monarch yet right?

[4:15:32] <%RubberFistFight> @LostCire Yeah it's something that not a lot of people know, courtesy of the whole "space is cold" thing - which whilst technically correct, doesn't operate the way you'd think due to the aforementioned vacuum and lack of convection/conduction. In fact, if you were spaced in Earth orbit, you'd bake to death before you froze (if you somehow didn't suffocate) because you'd be taking in more heat from the sun than you could dispose of.

[4:21:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight Ofcourse the dose of radiation will kill you later.
[4:21:28] <%RubberFistFight> @XeroSigmaPrime the sun radiates a shitload of energy, dude. You would pick it up faster than your body could dispose of it. Which would make your body temperature rise alarmingly fast. Think about how quickly you get warm standing in a sunbeam on earth - and that's WITH the atmosphere to carry the heat away from you. In space? That sunbeam's still there - the atmosphere ain't. Also, I did say that if you didn't suffocate/rupture from the vacuum. That would get you long before the baking.
[4:21:37] <%honeyman18> Its been long enough, I dont think it would take that long
[4:22:02] <+thenumber5point5> yogPag yogPag yogPag yogPag
[4:22:03] <internetexplorer11> if you went in the sun could you turn ssj3?
[4:22:03] <LSether> @honeyman18 Pats a king of backdown, it might take longer then you think
[4:22:04] <StromkoPenguin> I'm pretty sure it's just lack of oxygen that kills you in space. Everything else takes too long. Vacuum is a great insulator.
[4:22:11] <+Taglog7> wow more than 5 seconds
[4:22:14] <seniormeatbox> PAT SKELMO PEEPEE PEACH
[4:22:20] <Dakuu75> fucking ppl in chat arguing about what would kill you first, in the vacuum of space. XD
[4:22:33] <%Shoosler> Aliens.
[4:22:42] <StromkoPenguin> Yeah it's kinda irrelevant, it's like fish arguing over what kills you in a desert first
[4:22:49] <Dakuu75> @Shoosler obviously. see, you know.
[4:22:50] <%dekkitout> Clearly it's the stray lasers from deep space battle that'd kill you the hardest
[4:22:53] <derap41> @StromkoPenguin yup you can't hold your breath either
[4:22:59] <%Shoosler> Thargoids are a real threat.
[4:23:01] <%RubberFistFight> @StromkoPenguin yeah, it is. What I was talking about was purely theoretical, in the absence of the other things that would kill you first. I was pointing out that sci-fi has given us the "you freeze instantly" idea, when it's actually not the case at all.
[4:23:05] <%RupanSen> @StromkoPenguin I think extreme thermal conditions would be more fatal
[4:23:06] <+CanonHusbando> if i was ejected into the void of space i would simply hold my breath
[4:23:08] <$Mothman742> pat confirmed as not a 2 pump chump painter Kappa
[4:23:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @StromkoPenguin its a good insulator for all but radiative heat...like sunlight
[4:23:13] <+CanonHusbando> rip to your grandma but im different
[4:23:17] <mayorrev> Are these two actually fuckin DansGame
[4:23:20] <missingangle> the true threat is d e p r e s s i o n
[4:23:26] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Oof
[4:23:29] <sirrice77> i would rather get hit by a micrometeorid
[4:23:31] <$Mighty_observer> pat takes big poops
[4:23:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight Ok but how do those sun beams heat you?
[4:23:37] <$Mighty_observer> like a big boy
[4:23:37] <Dakuu75> @mayorrev dude.. they could be.
[4:23:37] <mayorrev> they spilling all the paint

[4:23:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight Convection
[4:23:45] <%honeyman18> The Void sucks too hard, only takes a few seconds to decompress
[4:23:47] <%dalmek> space isn't real stop lying to me
[4:23:52] <$Nobody404> @CanonHusbando if you hold your breath, your lungs woudl explode. At 0% atmospheric O2, oxygen is forced out of your bloodstream into your lungs
[4:23:53] <mayorrev> ewww!!
[4:23:59] <RyanTheRecluse> Pressure differentials are also bad
[4:24:02] <@lewdskeletor13> Space is just nighttime
[4:24:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight All the other nergy is other forms of radiation that cant be converted to heat by the lack of air
[4:24:11] <+CanonHusbando> nah, im different
[4:24:13] <Dakuu75> space is real, dude! it's not like Australia @dalmek
[4:24:23] <$Nobody404> Well I can't argue against that so maybe...
[4:24:36] <sirrice77> @Dakuu75 Australia is just anti space
[4:24:37] <%RubberFistFight> @XeroSigmaPrime lol no. Radiated thermal energy is a thing, dude. The sun is blasting every square millimeter of space around it for fucking millions of kilometers with infrared photons, to a near-ludicrous degree. More of them are hitting your body than your body can dispose of by radiation alone.
[4:24:47] <+MrN64> space is a MYTH
[4:24:51] <derap41> One think people never mention is your guts being ripped out of your stomach
[4:24:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dalmek sometimes you have to wake up and realize, you are a simi inteligent plain ape standing on the moist rocky bottom of a gravity well that is constantly falling into a giant nuclear explosion and accept that the world is just silly
[4:24:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Space is like Narnia.
[4:25:04] <+CanonHusbando> if space is real explain why the horizon is flat
[4:25:06] <Dakuu75> lmao, why is chat so much more entertaining during the "be right back" break
[4:25:09] <%ssjklyco> Bang bang bang
[4:25:10] <+lethallunacyx> This quickie is turning into a longie.

[4:25:28] <%honeyman18> Space wants your blood, avoid space I guess.
[4:25:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight So from all the radiation, only infrared radiation would interact as heat, correct? So far youre agreeing with me
[4:25:42] <%Valdorick> DUMPED
[4:25:44] <%Shoosler> How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real

[4:25:52] <Dakuu75> did pat change his shirt? or was he wearing that before?
[4:25:53] <LSether> @honeyman18 See i always say that as well but, at the same time the earth is in space. so we are in space right now. Sorta.

[4:26:01] <mayorrev> @angriestpat did you remember to clean up the paint?
[4:26:01] <%dekkitout> You think?
