[0:14:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> idk why do we have two virginias?
[0:14:57] <$dalmek> indeciciveness
[0:14:57] <%metalicblackcherry> Because even numbers
[0:14:57] <%Agami23> the fact that we got human beings to another celestial being, even if its a moon, is so fucking rad
[0:14:58] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I got my first real computer in 2000, and it was a windows MILLENIUM Edition
[0:14:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> HOLY SHIT DUDE

[0:14:59] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt for 4 senate seats
[0:14:59] <leole11> because one's north, and one's south
[0:15:00] <%barrakuta371> no idea
[0:15:00] <%Alazull> Because slavery
[0:15:00] <%Mr_Pylon> don't they have multiple Virginias too?
[0:15:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> HOLY FUCKING SHIT DUDE
[0:15:01] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt cause the D was to big
[0:15:01] <+dmbender> I'll be cold in my grave before I recognize south Dakota
[0:15:02] <Fien111> To make South Dakota feel better
[0:15:03] <%RealThiele> north dakota is sneaking up on you
[0:15:03] <%sirisvirus> 2nd dakota is a lie noone lives there
[0:15:04] <%akscully> increase the number of senators
[0:15:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> YOU'RE SO DUMB
[0:15:05] <iosephe> Slavery
[0:15:05] <%RayReborne> Cuz they fight each other and secede????
[0:15:05] <ExpressNode> Why do we have two Virginias?
[0:15:05] <CrematedCube> And Virginias, and Carolinas
[0:15:06] <%genocidal_cupcake> Yes
[0:15:06] <ghosrevan> why do we have canada?
[0:15:08] <@DakotaMacDoodle> I dont know
[0:15:08] <%king_wragles> @RayReborne Would you like a map sir/mam/kind soul?
[0:15:08] <EuropanLamprey> Gotta hit that round 50 number
[0:15:09] <%JoshManVGH> We also have two verginias and to carolinas
[0:15:09] <ChungusQuest> Frankly, even one Dakota is overdoing it
[0:15:10] <%genocidal_cupcake> North and South
[0:15:11] <ZE_Count> hated indian?
[0:15:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> DUDE ARE WE GONNA DO THIS NOW
[0:15:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> North and south Dakota
[0:15:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Virginia is even worse than the dakotas tbh
[0:15:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> We have north and South Dakota and north and South Carolina
[0:15:17] <+blaze__drag> it was actually a political move
[0:15:18] <%Monkeyweed21> CUZ WE HAVE TOO MUCH LAND
[0:15:18] <+pyrojack6> The battle for a unifed Dakota has been long and ardruous
[0:15:20] <%jtdobyns> we got 2 viriginias
[0:15:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Its weird
[0:15:22] <%Deadpal> the south dakota was a "slavery state" and north dakota was a "free state"
[0:15:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt What is this even?!
[0:15:23] <%genocidal_cupcake> In case we lose one
[0:15:23] <%SaiyanShoto> We might need extras
[0:15:24] <leole11> oh yes, north virginia
[0:15:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> because states can
[0:15:25] <%sirisvirus> ***
[0:15:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> they all hate each other
[0:15:27] <%dekkitout> Texas was almost 3-5 more states
[0:15:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> idk there's probably a reason
[0:15:28] <%RayReborne> the big slavery split up the states lol
[0:15:29] <%Frost_Quill> We have 50, maybe 51 soon.
[0:15:30] <ZE_Count> dem 50 stars tho
[0:15:30] <%Korzodin> We have liquid, we have solid, we have gasseous
[0:15:30] <%valriot> Seperated cos of THE TROUBLES
[0:15:30] <Minorou> we gotta beef up the starts on the flag
[0:15:31] <%polothegreatest> take hooomeee
[0:15:31] <%king_wragles> Those are DLC states
[0:15:31] <%Axellogic> My state is a liquid
[0:15:32] <%Cn_alpha_02> Tax reasons probably
[0:15:32] <$ringabal> Everyone knows there's nothing but wasteland between New York and California
[0:15:32] <RyuuAoi> YEAH PAT. Like 6 hours from y'all. My Rez is like right there near the border.
[0:15:33] <%RealThiele> like 50 of them
[0:15:33] <%Deadpal> it was to balance out the senate/house of represenatives.
[0:15:34] <@Ranryu692> West Virginia happened because they didn't want slavery but the rest of Virginia did
[0:15:35] <%Agami23> its typically because they hate each other, especially back in the civil war
[0:15:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> I just had a surreal moment of doubting whether North Carolina was real sbfpSetIn
[0:15:36] <%metalicblackcherry> We should reduce down to like 4 states yea
[0:15:36] <%king_wragles> We got them after
[0:15:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> state's can't get along so they split or somethin idk
[0:15:37] <%StaceMcGate> they are like spare kidneys
[0:15:37] <%walternatorz> what province should be split?
[0:15:37] <ExpressNode> Canada will be out 51st state Kappa
[0:15:38] <Tracazoid> Life all but 6
[0:15:38] <+Yamchadassist> you could just make middle merica one giant state tbh
[0:15:39] <%baka_sugoi> AND WE HAVE AND ISLAND AS A STATE
[0:15:39] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt we tried that once it went poorly
[0:15:39] <+blaze__drag> there is a West Virginia but not an East Virginia
[0:15:40] <%Alazull> We could also get rid of a few
[0:15:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> nah, more states more seats
[0:15:41] <Frogwash> Just give the land back if it shares a name with other states
[0:15:42] <Tracazoid> Like*
[0:15:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude, read a fucking encyclopedia article you doofus @PatStaresAt
[0:15:44] <Treasure_Vault> Then idiots would have less power, so no
[0:15:45] <teebos> at LEAST 4 states
[0:15:45] <%JoshManVGH> New England used to be one state
[0:15:46] <RyuuAoi> South Dakota is meth town.
[0:15:46] <%notsoy> same reason we have two virginias
[0:15:47] <%razielhex> @PatStaresAt The Dakota compromise was made by the conservative majority in the Bicameral legislature to ensure that it maintained Senatorial equivalency to protect its white ethnonationalist slave holding  protections.
[0:15:49] <%Mr_Pylon> which one's the horse armor state
[0:15:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Some parts are more "equal" than others and don't agree with freedom for "those" people
[0:15:50] <CrematedCube> PvP and PvE
[0:15:51] <thetntm> we never bought the old york dlc
[0:15:52] <%Alazull> Like Florida and Connecticut
[0:15:54] <+pyrojack6> just wait till we get Puerti Rico
[0:15:55] <%dekkitout> Hawaii, Alaska, PR and Guam are dlc's
[0:15:56] <%megadblitz> wait what will be potentially the 51st state
[0:15:59] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Texas was supposed to be split into 5
[0:15:59] <The_hidden_> and those extra states keep Republicans alive
[0:16:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> FOR FUN
[0:16:00] <%jtdobyns> They were Microtransaction states
[0:16:00] <EuropanLamprey> Real answer, many of them split during civil war due to some people wanting to keep slaves
[0:16:02] <marvel877> They're filler states
[0:16:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Only 13 base game states. The rest are DLC
[0:16:04] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> First 13 are the vanilla states.
[0:16:04] <not_twitter_rowan> That's our secret - we're actually many tiny countries in a trench coat sneaking into the world power convention
[0:16:05] <+PenmanLupine> Why would he read? He's a streamer
[0:16:07] <%Deadpal> CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO ALL DAY. IT'S SUPER FUN.
[0:16:09] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt it was probably a secondary result of pushing people to settle new states to inflate Congress to favor party lines.
[0:16:11] <%RayReborne> How about no Kappa
[0:16:11] <%LucasifTheOdd> Because americocentrism go brrrr
[0:16:13] <$ringabal> NO PAST, ONLY VIDYA
[0:16:13] <%Agami23> why do you guys have quebec?
[0:16:14] <%dekkitout> You never study geography for fun?

[0:16:17] <+pyrojack6> BECAUSE IT AFFECT YOU
[0:16:18] <%Deadpal> IT'S HOW I LEARNED ABOUT A TON OF RANDOM SHIT AND COUNTRIES
[0:16:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Because you ask too many questions LUL
[0:16:20] <@DakotaMacDoodle> It's true the league of Dakota's has been keeping up the illusion of a South Dakota since the 1800's @PatStaresAt
[0:16:21] <CrypticMochi> No one cares about the middle states
[0:16:21] <%akscully> west virginia split after virginia joined the confederacy, didn't want to be associated with slavers
[0:16:21] <%baka_sugoi> USA DLC ONLY $20.99
[0:16:22] <%RealThiele> but america is so important

[0:16:33] <%hewlettfan96> Americagocentrism is important
[0:16:35] <RyuuAoi> Pat, do you come to the Dakotas to shop for school clothes/supplies?
[0:16:36] <ZE_Count> I mean Canada is pretty much part of USA or will be when the water wars happen.

[0:19:25] <%RetroCop87> The detail I like is that they TRIED to find someone in the office who liked it
[0:19:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Frosty NO!
[0:19:31] <%megadblitz> oh this was in the lp i remember now
[0:19:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah that happens
[0:19:37] <+pyrojack6> At least our states aren't seperated by something stupid like their language, the Franco-Anglo rivalry bullshit sounds like a nightmare
[0:19:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Everyone in the office hates it"
[0:19:43] <RyuuAoi> We deserve God Hand Remake.
[0:19:44] <%DrTomT18> what a shit load of fuck
[0:19:45] <%valriot> To be fair, that game is fuckin POISON to some people, on top of being genuinely jank as fuck
[0:19:46] <%RayReborne> The LP when you and Woolie talked about it was great
[0:19:47] <%Valdorick> Didn't have a Games Journo Mode Kappa
[0:19:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> That's because they aren't real gamers
[0:19:54] <%sirisvirus> What's your view on chaos versus Limp Biskit
[0:19:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Those guys are losers
[0:20:00] <%RetroCop87> I wonder how many more modern games that would happen if reviews happened in isolation
[0:20:01] <%Deadpal> yep.
[0:20:04] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[0:20:07] <%Deadpal> I know a few of them went to giant bomb too.
[0:20:08] <+Kyma1020> what a bunch of losers
[0:20:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> "no look we ALL have bad taste"
[0:20:11] <%baka_sugoi> games journalism ResidentSleeper
[0:20:14] <%Mr_Pylon> things haven't changed much since then
[0:20:14] <%Korzodin> its not a good look, makes your office look like a bunch of the same guy
[0:20:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's why you take everything ign says with a mountain of salt
[0:20:15] <%Deadpal> they talked about that in the last few years
[0:20:15] <%Monkeyweed21> IGN isnt paid off, they just have shit taste
[0:20:16] <%Maids4lyfe> so they're gamer journalists
[0:20:18] <%Deadpal> none of them liked action games.
[0:20:19] <%LucasifTheOdd> IGN, thinking? Hahaha
[0:20:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Go figure, game journalists couldn't play games but could "usually" words good
[0:20:21] <+rafaelba93> it just added to the legend
[0:20:21] <primaryfire> is this his first time with echoes of the eye?
[0:20:22] <leole11> "that guy doesn't suck at the game, we all do!"
[0:20:23] <%Deadpal> not a single one of them liked action games.
[0:20:29] <%RealThiele> "we are all piss babies, see?"
[0:20:33] <%Deadpal> @primaryfire no
[0:20:37] <RayCSmooth> Business as usual
[0:20:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The opposite of people who play games, but words bad
[0:20:40] <%valriot> Pat, review FIFA
[0:20:41] <%Frost_Quill> @primaryfire He played some two days ago.
[0:20:44] <%redthebaron> redthebaron subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:20:44] <%DrTomT18> Local man is very wrong
[0:20:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> banjo kazooie
[0:20:46] <%LucasifTheOdd> Which is why review sites are garbage
[0:20:47] <%sirisvirus> Pat review Fifa
[0:20:47] <%StaceMcGate> like Superman
[0:20:49] <%RetroCop87> there are people giving Lost Judgement a 7/10 for not innovating
[0:20:50] <%LucasifTheOdd> They're inconsistent
[0:20:52] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt like puzzle and rts games?
[0:20:52] <OldManDeckardCain> people are already mad LUL
[0:20:53] <rytisone> Pat reviews racing games
[0:20:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> I'm not good at fighting games and character action, and I still managed to struggle through Ninja Gaiden Black on hard.
[0:20:55] <%dekkitout> Game Journalist Pat ranks top 6 in worst AU Pats
[0:20:56] <$ringabal> Fully honest question: Do we really need review journalism for video games?
[0:20:57] <%baka_sugoi> Pat reviews C H A O S
[0:20:58] <%Korzodin> That's why you have a variety of review styles and tastes in an office like that
[0:20:58] <%Deadpal> PPAT NO
[0:20:59] <leole11> LMAO
[0:21:02] <primaryfire> @Frost_Quill @Deadpal ty I'll check that out
[0:21:02] <%Deadpal> don't talk about banjo again.
[0:21:03] <RyuuAoi> IGN a bunch of Fox News journalists trying to make a quick buck.
[0:21:03] <%StaceMcGate> Eekum Pokum/10
[0:21:03] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh god Pats reviews would be so bad LUL LUL
[0:21:03] <%JoshManVGH> What game would you give the lowest score!?
[0:21:04] <MementoImpetus> @PatStaresAt but they would ask you to review yearly madden LUL
[0:21:04] <%Deadpal> don't do it.
[0:21:06] <%CTMathiu> that's fair
[0:21:07] <marvel877> Pat, we're always mad at you for something. Banjo, Donkey Kong Country, Viewtiful Joe, etc.
[0:21:08] <%MidnightBurst12> memories of Kenshi arise
[0:21:09] <leole11> yeah but you're wrong on that so that's ok
[0:21:10] <%Frost_Quill> I still need to try Banjo and Kazooie.
[0:21:10] <%LucasifTheOdd> You can't tell if you're going to like the game because it's always someone with different taste reviewing it
[0:21:13] <+rafaelba93> im already mad
[0:21:14] <%DrTomT18> Pat reviews Destroy all Humans?
[0:21:17] <%VHGS> That would be like a "They hated him because he told the truth" situation though
[0:21:17] <+dmbender> but what about Banjo Tooie
[0:21:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They would make you apologise to the readers Pat
[0:21:19] <+RelikaNox> That's why frothing at the mouth over game reviews is absolutely pointless
[0:21:23] <%valriot> YEYEYE PAUL
[0:21:24] <+snausages_> A negative review by someone who dislikes something is a valid perspective though
[0:21:28] <+Kyma1020> just be like Jack and call Bullshit and walk away blaring Limp Bizkit
[0:21:29] <%dekkitout> Paul.. I just shuttered at the name
[0:21:32] <ExpressNode> Beat?
[0:21:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I should start up a review site, with 8 years QA experience i can shit on games with full force of knowing they WNF'd an issue i run into and bitch about with vigor
[0:21:34] <+Mrbaconator> oof
[0:21:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> my condolences
[0:21:35] <DianaTheAscian> I always thought Gene was on his own
[0:21:35] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn OH GOD GENSHIN
[0:21:36] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I mean, let's be honest, Pat. Your distaste on some things are questionable. :P
[0:21:37] <%valriot> Paul is great, he does good Destiny videos
[0:21:38] <%dekkitout> He's cool
[0:21:39] <RyuuAoi> Don't talk about Donkey Kong Country. You'll be fired!
[0:21:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH NOOOOOO
[0:21:42] <$Ziegsy> I used to review games for a living. Minecraft StoryMode ep2 was so bad I quit rather than review it
[0:21:43] <$dalmek> reports from the Genshin front
[0:21:43] <%Monkeyweed21> RIP FEMBOYS
[0:21:45] <%RealThiele> the gacha gaol as it were
[0:21:46] <%SaiyanShoto> You say you don’t play a game of it controls like shit yet you enjoyed Godhand psaSmug
[0:21:48] <%Maids4lyfe> Paul DansGame
[0:21:54] <%CTMathiu> bless his heart
[0:21:57] <%MidnightBurst12> genshin impact type beat?
[0:21:59] <%DrTomT18> Pat, you and I have very similar tastes. I haven't heard you say you hate anything that I love. Yet. You even introduced me to a few games, like Prey!
[0:22:02] <%kewlmyc> Trapped in the gacha hole
[0:22:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> locked in the genshin basement
[0:22:12] <+zacyzacy> its wild how huge genshins audience is
[0:22:12] <%RealThiele> yea genshin is super fucked with the new ccp hates femboys laws
[0:22:16] <%korean_random> korean_random subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! weebs in indertPEPEYA
[0:22:24] <%valriot> He does that already with Destiny too
[0:22:25] <mr_saturday93> Genshin is fun but don't waste your money on gacha
[0:22:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Paul Tassi wrote all those articles about Destiny 2's problems
[0:22:28] <%RetroCop87> Mario Bros 3 has objectively terrible level design. You can't dispute this fact.
[0:22:42] <RyuuAoi> Did Pat say anything about the Konami bullshit yet?
[0:22:43] <ghosrevan> i don't even care about genshin to be honest
[0:22:45] <+zacyzacy> yeah i completely agree
[0:22:49] <%DrTomT18> Don't have opitions
[0:22:52] <%DrTomT18> that's the moral of the story
[0:22:56] <%dekkitout> Paul's probably the best fit for Genshin since Destiny's about to go dry for three months
[0:22:56] <Minorou> but that would cost money!
[0:22:57] <%RayReborne> Genshin is meh to me i stopped after 4 hours and didnt spend a penny
[0:22:59] <%hewlettfan96> My cat is gaseous
[0:23:04] <The_hidden_> i just got back into genshin, anniversay primogems
[0:23:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Mario bros 3 levels would be a game jam today
[0:23:08] <DianaTheAscian> They'ed make tons if they had a ff14 guy
[0:23:12] <%baka_sugoi> The Genshin Community is butt hurt about the anniversary rewards
[0:23:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> that doesn't really seem cost efficient
[0:23:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> One week to make a mario bros
[0:23:18] <guiltyboya> wait, what konami bullshit?
[0:23:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> So Balance?
[0:23:20] <%Korzodin> You get someone with interest in the genre to do the review
[0:23:21] <%RetroCop87> have two reviewers per-game: one that enjoys the genre, and one who barely touches the genre
[0:23:23] <%Frost_Quill> I don't read game reviews anymore.  Like I genuinely don't read them, I just look at how people talk about the games on forums and reddits.
[0:23:24] <%korean_random> true
[0:23:25] <%DrTomT18> wow pat that all sounds reasonable, shut the hell up.
[0:23:25] <KasiCrafter> Pat's Notes, even
[0:23:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> HA. Patch notes.
[0:23:27] <%polothegreatest> well buy mgs3 with the pachinko cutscenes LUL
[0:23:38] <+RelikaNox> Ooh boy some of the FFXIV articles I've seen since the game got bigger lately have been......something, and obviously written by someone who hasn't even tried the trial
[0:23:44] <DianaTheAscian> Those guides are little out of date sadly
[0:23:47] <+zacyzacy> i sure someones doing stuff but writing quality will vary
[0:23:49] <%RayReborne> Business update! too fat and smelly go away Kappa
[0:23:50] <%valriot> Some people do have that i think,  i think EasyAllies has an "FF14 Guy" and they have their FC on Ultros actually
[0:23:52] <%GalacticaPhanto> why didn't you get part of the media tour thing thing?
[0:24:02] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hey Pat, is this a bad stream to watch if I haven’t played Outerwilds?
[0:24:06] <%RealThiele> wowhead is swapping to 14 so they will be filling some of that gap
[0:24:09] <%hewlettfan96> You are much too smelly to be here
[0:24:12] <Minorou> simplification of fighting games gave us Divekick
[0:24:13] <%jtdobyns> Oh lol Endwalker comes out 2 days before US Thanksgiving lol
[0:24:16] <%Korzodin> Someone who's interested in the genre will likely have way more insight than some MMO guy playing a racing game for the first time
[0:24:16] <%Dova573> man I cant waiy to kill chaos with limp biskit blasting in the background
[0:24:18] <OldManDeckardCain> pat hates COMBO
[0:24:19] <michlarv> Hey Pat any plans to check out castlevania advance collection? Awesome ports.
[0:24:21] <%Frost_Quill> @RelikaNox Remember that guy who skipped XIV's story, and then called the story trash?
[0:24:32] <%korean_random> do combo though
[0:24:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> I agree
[0:24:36] <%dekkitout> Simplify how, first?
[0:24:39] <%baka_sugoi> naw
[0:24:41] <%DrTomT18> Just make it FUN
[0:24:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Just have good single plqyer for once
[0:24:47] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @frost_quill *shudders*
[0:24:50] <primaryfire> oh yeah dragonball is fucked
[0:24:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh
[0:24:53] <+pyrojack6> BUT DRAGONBALL THO
[0:25:01] <%LucasifTheOdd> Accessible vs simple. Some people mistake the two
[0:25:03] <%Dova573> Is still simpler than mvc
[0:25:06] <OldManDeckardCain> you mean lower?
[0:25:08] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt also the games working is nice
[0:25:10] <marvel877> Fighterz is hard and its fun but BOY that netcode needs fixing.
[0:25:12] <Mr_Rakjo> @PatStaresAt the new Melty has autocombos that you cant turn off on all buttons so cause im bad im struggling to do actual for realsies combos
[0:25:13] <%hewlettfan96> Dragonball Fighterz is deceptively complex
[0:25:14] <%Agami23> meltyblood is what got me thinking about it
[0:25:16] <%polothegreatest> fgc crowd will gatekeep it dont worry about it
[0:25:16] <Frogwash> @JustAnotherTrapArtist If you want to play this game, it's best to not see anything. Entire game is just knowing what happens.
[0:25:17] <%baka_sugoi> auto combo is nice in melty
[0:25:17] <+zacyzacy> LUL
[0:25:17] <+RelikaNox> @Frost_Quill Oh man we've had some choice moments in the last several weeks...
[0:25:21] <brunoberserk> new melty blood has A LOT of auto-combos
[0:25:24] <+dmbender> Do you think Dragon ball is perhaps a bit easier to get into because of the universe and characters that many people grew up watching?
[0:25:26] <%Frost_Quill> I shoot the kamehameha and then power up and shoot the kamehameha.
[0:25:33] <vVAstrAVv> fuck this nerd fighting shit get to the owl cult :3
[0:25:34] <%LucasifTheOdd> Accessible
[0:25:36] <%Deadpal> Accessible?
[0:25:37] <%Korzodin> Make it more intuitive
[0:25:38] <DianaTheAscian> accessible?
[0:25:40] <%baka_sugoi> you can back beat in the new mwlty
[0:25:42] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @frost_quill and also the reason why the story apparently sucks is because you have to READ
[0:25:44] <%notsoy> the way they did it in UNI is the smartest implementation
[0:25:46] <%Monkeyweed21> readable
[0:25:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> also, better user experience for fighting games helps
[0:25:52] <%SaiyanShoto> Auto combos are fine but when the auto combo does more damage and is better than other combos then that’s a big problem
[0:25:56] <+Kyma1020> accessible
[0:25:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Convoluted
[0:26:01] <%Korzodin> Mechanics can be super complicated if they make sense
[0:26:02] <%LucasifTheOdd> If a new player can't even properly play the game when they start then they're not going to keep playing
[0:26:03] <%baka_sugoi> YES
[0:26:04] <%G_Thunders> Make more dumberer
[0:26:08] <cheapdoc> And I wanna do Goku ... wait
[0:26:09] <+JaseAdrift> do combo
[0:26:12] <+zacyzacy> minimum competecy is too high
[0:26:14] <CrematedCube> There's the minimum complexity needed and there's the maximum potential complexity
[0:26:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> like netcode and tutorials
[0:26:15] <%hewlettfan96> Make it more readable and learnable
[0:26:19] <%DrTomT18> Best course of action: Play more Outer Wilds
[0:26:20] <@Ranryu692> doesn't matter how complex it is if it's fun the whole time
[0:26:23] <+adamthreetimes> they can be complicated and approachable
[0:26:28] <%SaiyanShoto> As Max said, what brings people in is how the game looks, the roster, and overall it has to be fun
[0:26:29] <+Kyma1020> New Melty Blood auto combo does less damage then a Manuel input
[0:26:30] <%Tman451> I've bounced off of Monster Hunter so many times, I can never get into it
[0:26:30] <%korean_random> sounds like PoE LUL
[0:26:30] <%RayReborne> pffff wow
[0:26:33] <%Frost_Quill> You legit have to put in 40 or so hours to get into Monster Hunter for the first time.
[0:26:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> i fully agree with this
[0:26:36] <+pyrojack6> The problem is that OGs in the FGC are such bastard gate keepers that they don't bother with the difference
[0:26:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I OWN, Monster Hunter 1 on PS2
[0:26:45] <+unhuggable1> monster hunter on ps2 online was awesome
[0:26:46] <%Valdorick> "Go into stance A then do Combo B but midway through hold your input to swap into Stance C then qaurterback half circle into Stance B and you do the cool thing"
[0:26:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It is a fucking nightmare
[0:26:51] <%Faustgesicht> Oh yeah
[0:26:55] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Like imagine playing League but being forced to learn Fiora first instead of someone like Garen.
[0:26:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fucking Paintballs
[0:26:56] <%Korzodin> Also, that. Conveying what the player ought to know is super important.
[0:26:56] <%notsoy> smash is reasonably complex at higher levels but its floor is so low anyone can get into it
[0:26:59] <%valriot> Its like people who complain that FF14 is braindead, the game isnt built for insane people who want absurd class minmaxing
[0:27:05] <bear_breaker20> old school monster hunter starts at home schooling for menus
[0:27:08] <%dekkitout> Now, just wiki/forum dive for mh for progression optimization
[0:27:11] <%baka_sugoi> fair
[0:27:19] <+Like51bears> i remember fighting boars with the analog stick in the first one for days
[0:27:22] <HeroToxiko> yeah i remember 3u, it's still in my sterilite tower
[0:27:23] <%RealThiele> well 14 has savage/ultimate if you wanna dance like  maniac
[0:27:25] <primaryfire> uniclr lets you cancel pretty much any button into any other which is pretty nice as a new player
[0:27:30] <%SaiyanShoto> @pyrojack6 that’s in everything
[0:27:35] <%polothegreatest> "why my x game dying" BabyRage
[0:27:40] <%baka_sugoi> PUNCH
[0:27:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> the reason I got into strive wasn't because it was simplified, but because I got to the fun part of actually playing people almost instantly, even if I was losing
[0:27:42] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @notsoy I feel Smash is one of those "easy to play, hard to master" sort of games
[0:27:42] <%Frost_Quill> My first Monster Hunter was Tri, I quit at Barroth and didn't really get into the series until World.
[0:27:44] <+toastybites> "Watch this 14 season show that gets good 2 seasons in"
[0:27:45] <HeroToxiko> im so glad they introduced switchaxe even though im a big swordboy now
[0:27:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> World solved a LOT, of Monster Hunter's pain points
[0:27:46] <%DrTomT18> "When does it get fun?" "That's the secret, it doesn't!"
[0:27:48] <%dekkitout> "You really wanna learn these animations for when they ohko you on master rank"
[0:27:48] <+zacyzacy> POE has the same problem too
[0:27:51] <%RayReborne> let me suplex the Big Chicken Kappa
[0:27:55] <%ZephynM> You can learn inventory as you go. If it takes too long, it's going to suck.
[0:27:59] <The_hidden_> casual gaming
[0:28:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Dude, Lao Shen Lung
[0:28:05] <floredon> memorizing combos can get ridiculous
[0:28:05] <%notsoy> tutorials/onboarding are really bad in most FGs, skullgirls is one of the best but so few do it that well
[0:28:10] <%Deadpal> I wanna do the goku super animation attack that looks cool
[0:28:10] <%baka_sugoi> no one dose tutorials or mission modes
[0:28:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's like 3 map screen wide
[0:28:19] <%SaiyanShoto> Also with fighting games you gotta be willing to lose A LOT
[0:28:20] <+pyrojack6> @SaiyanShoto obviously, but the topic at that point was FGC so that's who i directed it at
[0:28:27] <%Deadpal> I wanna see the Gogeta ssj4 1hitkill auto move
[0:28:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> no one does mission mode or tutorials because theyre boring
[0:28:33] <%Deadpal> that shtis cool
[0:28:34] <%RealThiele> its gonna get refunded
[0:28:43] <%baka_sugoi> yeah
[0:28:49] <%polothegreatest> i took mhw unga bunga style but after learn properly
[0:28:50] <%Deadpal> YEAH.
[0:28:50] <+Yamchadassist> i adore dbfz only having quarter circle
[0:28:55] <%dekkitout> Too bad 🙃
[0:28:57] <@Ranryu692> you still wouldn't play it LUL
[0:28:59] <%hewlettfan96> ‘I want to blast my enemies and to septuple backflips soon, you don’t get to till 50 hours in’
[0:29:00] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt maybe if they make a new
[0:29:01] <OldManDeckardCain> blazblue might get rollback now LUL
[0:29:01] <marvel877> Fix the netcode and I'll be back in that game.
[0:29:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> it doesn't matter how in depth the tutorials are if its boring
[0:29:04] <DianaTheAscian> one*
[0:29:04] <floredon> Drinking Monster Energy while talking about Monster Hunter is a big dick energy move
[0:29:05] <%Dova573> tbf that also ignoring the fact its DBZ AND LOOKS GOOD
[0:29:08] <%RealThiele> but blitz tho
[0:29:14] <+zacyzacy> which game?
[0:29:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no it's too hard to implement tho
[0:29:16] <%Tman451> How simple is too simple though?  DBZ is really simple execution wise, but KOF can go too far imo
[0:29:19] <%SaiyanShoto> I love DBFZ but the auto combos can be so annoying with how good they are
[0:29:25] <%baka_sugoi> just have a game with rekas only
[0:29:25] <%korean_random> FBBlock good netcode
[0:29:25] <+pyrojack6> you have that one cool clip and then "nah, i'm good"
[0:29:28] <%polothegreatest> blaz rollback nice
[0:29:29] <%Deadpal> @RealThiele No.
[0:29:31] <%hewlettfan96> What game again
[0:29:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Strive having slash HS qcf be a near universal combo was a good idea
[0:29:41] <%notsoy> the presentation of an FG is also extremely important - mvc3 got a shit-ton of attention and fanart despite being very difficult
[0:29:42] <%PocketBearIllustrator> gawd, I wish Smash Ultimate's netcode was at least good
[0:29:44] <%Dova573> Fantasy  Strike is tooo simple
[0:29:53] <%RayReborne> so whats the biggest baby Fighter Pat?
[0:29:53] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:29:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> I heard some conspiracy theory that arcsys withheld rollback to help strives launch and its so stupid
[0:29:57] <+silentblast93> hey pat I stated ffxiv 3 weeks ago and I'm already lvl 65 how much of a grind will 70 to 80 be?
[0:29:59] <%Tman451> I agree
[0:30:10] <%Monkeyweed21> just quarter circles and occasional dp's
[0:30:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> withheld from dbfz
[0:30:13] <%Deadpal> that's a dumbass theory.
[0:30:15] <+Yamchadassist> rising thunder was great as the simple fg
[0:30:23] <primaryfire> tekken has pretty intuitive input buffering and since it's slower overall I feel like dexterity is less of an issue
[0:30:24] <%baka_sugoi> BOO
[0:30:27] <%hewlettfan96> @saiyanshoto Honestly A game that is way too overlooked is battle of z it did fighting way better than xenoverse ever did
[0:30:30] <%Deadpal> simpler theory. They were working on a differnet game.
[0:30:38] <+zacyzacy> and also DBZ is a much bigger IP than GG
[0:30:39] <%dekkitout> Interweb lingo
[0:30:42] <%RayReborne> PepeYeah
[0:30:42] <%Deadpal> SPESS
[0:30:43] <%baka_sugoi> S P A C E
[0:30:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @silentblast93 on your main? basically none if you just do msq. for alt job? not too bad
[0:30:46] <leole11> time to get owl'd
[0:30:46] <%korean_random> it's an emote :)
[0:30:46] <%Alazull> That man had a stroke
[0:30:47] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's TIME
[0:30:50] <%Deadpal> we're in outer space tho pat
[0:30:51] <%DrTomT18> time for the SPOOK
[0:30:51] <%Dova573> also again Dbz was directed by bandai not arcsys
[0:30:53] <%Deadpal> it's the darktime
[0:30:54] <+pyrojack6> some deep internets right there dawg
[0:30:56] <%Frost_Quill> Pat took too long and the universe ended so sad.
[0:30:56] <%notsoy> tekken is also innately slower since even the fastest buttons are 10f, compared to 3-6f for most 2D FGs
[0:30:58] <OldManDeckardCain> there is no signal in space Kappa
[0:30:59] <%Dova573> Arcsys developed it
[0:31:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> also daisuke was like "half the strive engineering team was on the fence on rollback"
[0:31:01] <%hewlettfan96> What about virtua fighter mechanics
[0:31:02] <%SaiyanShoto> @hewlettfan96 personally I didn’t like that game but I did enjoy it a bit more than Xenoverse LUL
[0:31:03] <Minorou> no signal? Did you bump into the satellite again?
[0:31:06] <%DrTomT18> This game has the best fucking sound track
[0:31:07] <%polothegreatest> if dbz got rollback strive would not be too prominent
[0:31:22] <%Ixiah> get paige to watch you play Kappa
[0:31:23] <+zacyzacy> No signal? equip signal scope
[0:31:24] <@DakotaMacDoodle> To da big NIGHTTIME!
[0:31:28] <%hewlettfan96> Why is the netcode for smash bros ultimate so poor?

[0:31:50] <+zacyzacy> I have been thinking about ahow good this game is since it came out
[0:31:58] <%baka_sugoi> SPACE C H A O S
[0:32:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> @polothegreatest if more games had rollback fighting games would be more prominent

[0:32:16] <mr_saturday93> STOP TRIGGERING ME EITH CHAOS
[0:32:16] <+snausages_> The VR mod for this is amazing btw, enhanced the whole thing that this is going for
[0:32:20] <%hewlettfan96> @saiyanshoto Yeah TFS even put it as the 6th (yes really) best DB game ever in their 2017 best DBZ games. It’s honestly really great
[0:32:21] <%korean_random> space is cool

[0:34:21] <%Deadpal> oh no.
[0:34:27] <+zacyzacy> did anyone else actually solve the puzzle that gets you in here the first time? that the first time i had to look something up
[0:34:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> have you tried to surf the wave all the way around yet?

[0:35:26] <haitakaa> is this dlc spooky?
[0:35:29] <%JoshManVGH> His boating is just as good as his starship landing
[0:35:31] <+blaze__drag> Think about raft

[0:36:04] <vVAstrAVv> @haitakaa depends on what you call spooky. it wasn't to me
[0:36:10] <Edsta94> @Deadpal between starlit cove and the gorge is the best spot to ride the wave for that long
[0:36:13] <ZE_Count> The video game held your hand so kind
[0:36:14] <nomos42> aww fuck yeh
[0:36:14] <%dekkitout> It's why we call spoopy space "Night time"

[0:42:16] <%Dakuu75> lol
[0:42:20] <leole11> what a god of a gamer
[0:42:24] <CrematedCube> No text, all pictures
[0:42:25] <%Deadpal> nah
[0:42:32] <%Deadpal> he's got some time before the wave
[0:42:33] <$ringabal> But will we rewrite history?
[0:42:34] <%Dopamien> 🌒 🪐 🌒 ⭐ ⭐
[0:42:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> jumbo brain
[0:42:40] <buhbuhboat> yeah we gaming
[0:42:54] <%Deadpal> yeah pat
[0:42:54] <MyNameIsRasus> this game makes you feel like a big smartman
[0:42:56] <korpocalypse> that's hype
[0:42:56] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's an expansion pack
[0:42:57] <%Deadpal> it's super great
[0:42:59] <%dekkitout> I's a gaiden
[0:42:59] <Rionxgarland> does that mystery involve math science and history
[0:43:00] <%DrTomT18> It's a side-qual
[0:43:00] <%Buzzard42> yes
[0:43:03] <Edsta94> they called it an expansion
[0:43:03] <+upandadam> oh yeah it is
[0:43:03] <%bassoontyphoon> 🥐 🪐 🥐 🌟 🌟
[0:43:03] <cheapdoc> It kind of is a sequel, holy shit
[0:43:08] <%SovPho> How am I supposed to say anything to anything without spoiling this.
[0:43:09] <harmless_toast> I would pay for this as a standalone game
[0:43:09] <+blaze__drag> pretty much
[0:43:09] <ZE_Count> thats very pogchamp of them
[0:43:10] <$dalmek> they really were like "yeah fuck it we'll make this Myst and it'll be dope"
[0:43:10] <danraven> I hope they continue making stuff like this
[0:43:11] <%Valdorick> Its not DLC, its a full blown expansion.
[0:43:11] <%DrTomT18> I hope they make MORE outer wilds
[0:43:13] <Lajong_z> ye kinda agree
[0:43:13] <%DrTomT18> I love this shit
[0:43:13] <%Buzzard42> it's an actual old fashioned expansion pack
[0:43:13] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> ign japan posted rise pc gameplay FeelsAmazingMan
[0:43:13] <korpocalypse> all DLCs should be sequels
[0:43:19] <+blaze__drag> it's probably almost as long as the base game depending on how you handle the puzzles
[0:43:20] <vVAstrAVv> expansion
[0:43:22] <DianaTheAscian> it basically is a sequel
[0:43:22] <+TombstoneTTromboners> like the expansion packs of the old days
[0:43:23] <tanarath> @patstaresat Expansion Pack
[0:43:23] <%Alazull> Vananas
[0:43:23] <%Monkeyweed21> its a proper expansion
[0:43:26] <%JoshManVGH> That's a hell of a way to do things
[0:43:26] <cheapdoc> Ba na na s
[0:43:26] <+Slimperton> i'm 8 hours in and barely ahead of pat, its really good
[0:43:28] <%Deadpal> @SovPho in taht case say nothing (I know it's hard I also want to say shit)
[0:43:28] <%jtdobyns> There is so much more potential and "DLC" they can add
[0:43:29] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt Just be sure to beat the game normally after you complete the DLC.
[0:43:34] <Edsta94> i hope they make a brand new game next
[0:43:39] <%Buzzard42> one might describe this as the Brood War of adventure games
[0:43:40] <+blaze__drag> between the Light and Dark Worlds it's basically the equivalent of 2 planets that are each bigger than any other planet in the system
[0:43:42] <bear_breaker20> its says "ur lame if you read this"
[0:43:43] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt it's in your logs dw
[0:43:47] <+upandadam> better go back to giant's deep
[0:43:47] <%JoshManVGH> BIG CHEAT
[0:43:49] <%Buzzard42> is this a fresh file?
[0:43:52] <korpocalypse> I like this graphics style

[0:43:53] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt well the ship log says the names of the areas doesnt it?

[0:43:57] <+TombstoneTTromboners> good
[0:43:57] <%Valdorick> The code tells you as you're doing the last puzzle.
[0:43:58] <The_hidden_> it says "you lost the game"
[0:43:59] <%Deadpal> this is a finished file
[0:44:03] <Lajong_z> then its in the logs

[0:52:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bad plan
[0:52:29] <%Buzzard42> F
[0:52:31] <$ringabal> The greatest plan
[0:52:31] <leole11> no plan
[0:52:32] <Riyokuno> there is a monster underwater LUL
[0:52:33] <AluxStreams> Oh no here it comes...
[0:52:35] <%DrTomT18> almost as bad as when he flew into the sun
[0:52:37] <ZE_Count> free raft
[0:52:46] <leole11> 3/10 plan
[0:52:47] <mr_saturday93> Ok Dutch van DER lan
[0:52:50] <ZE_Count> what a hero
[0:52:55] <+redyoshi5> the plan is working as intended
[0:52:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> use your moxie pat
[0:52:59] <DianaTheAscian> 1st try
[0:53:00] <cheapdoc> @leole11 too much water
[0:53:04] <%tank7013> Now I'm not an expert but uh... none of these plans have seemed very good
[0:53:04] <%RealThiele> this feels planned out
[0:53:09] <leole11> lmao
[0:53:13] <%JonathLP> moxie > health
[0:53:17] <Lajong_z> chat did he do any of the... spooky stuff
[0:53:18] <vVAstrAVv> pat there was just... another working elevator
[0:53:25] <%DrTomT18> @RealThiele I promise you it isn't
[0:53:25] <%bassoontyphoon> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[0:53:29] <%Agami23> you know, this place would make a pretty kick ass water park. it already has a lazy river
[0:53:34] <leole11> will pat find the thing
[0:53:37] <ZE_Count> pat shall do what he will
[0:53:38] <%Frost_Quill> @Lajong_z If you mean going to the shadow world yes.
[0:53:51] <AoiRob> no the other one
[0:53:53] <+Delenay> the inlet wasnt here
[0:53:55] <Lajong_z> @Frost_Quill sweet
[0:53:57] <%DrTomT18> Pat it would be easier to find without the water
[0:54:00] <DianaTheAscian> what that green thing?
[0:54:02] <vVAstrAVv> @lajong_z hes been to the dork world but not done any of the real shit there
[0:54:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> this shit looks kinda busted
[0:54:05] <%tank7013> Great plan
[0:54:05] <leole11> the inlet was closer to the projector room
[0:54:08] <AoiRob> next to the projector building
[0:54:09] <MyNameIsRasus> @lajong_z small parts of it
[0:54:12] <+Delenay> its that one on your right
[0:54:15] <Riyokuno> F this run
[0:54:16] <Lajong_z> @vVAstrAVv gotcha
[0:54:18] <$dalmek> it's only an inlet if it's smaller than 6 feet
[0:54:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's tiiiiime
[0:54:21] <+redyoshi5> guys he can figure it out
[0:54:26] <%derpy_platypus> times up
[0:54:33] <+Pequod1> new bit
[0:54:35] <leole11> good plan
[0:54:35] <%Like51bears> check logs lol
[0:54:38] <ZE_Count> big brain
[0:54:40] <+blaze__drag> I love how this has just been a comedy of errors
[0:54:44] <%JonathLP> needs moxie
[0:54:47] <AoiRob> just start over
[0:54:48] <MyNameIsRasus> you'll find it
[0:54:52] <%derpy_platypus> that was the plan all along
[0:55:00] <vVAstrAVv> meditate meditate meditate meditate
[0:55:02] <iosephe> Yeah
[0:55:05] <%DrTomT18> yeah
[0:55:07] <%jtdobyns> remember hidden grove shortcut
[0:55:09] <leole11> the logs are stuck in the ship, and you're nowhere near the ship
[0:55:09] <$dalmek> yeah fair
[0:55:09] <%DrTomT18> I wish you had a PDA or something
[0:55:10] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah
[0:55:12] <+Pequod1> the overall integration is... weird
[0:55:13] <Louie_Salmon> Mm, yeah I guess so
[0:55:13] <%Buzzard42> yeah I had the same isue
[0:55:17] <%tank7013> They really should have given you like a tablet or something
[0:55:22] <ZE_Count> having the log on you would be nice
[0:55:22] <Riyokuno> you had your ship always with you, yeah
[0:55:22] <+blaze__drag> yeah they kinda purposefully hard block you off from your ship
[0:55:23] <%Agami23> it would have been cool if they gave you a portable ship log
[0:55:25] <+extantCadence> It was not always easier, but you were at your ship more often
[0:55:27] <Explodincatz> its not over yet
[0:55:27] <vVAstrAVv> thats fair
[0:55:32] <+blaze__drag> cause having it in the ring would be busted
[0:55:33] <danraven> feels kinda like brittle hollow
[0:55:38] <+upandadam> oh i didn't think to try a waypoint with these
[0:55:47] <MyNameIsRasus> 'Member the hull shortcut Pat?
[0:55:53] <bear_breaker20> baby game
[0:55:56] <vVAstrAVv> youre litterally locked inside once it floods too
[0:55:58] <%DrTomT18> If you mark that it just sends you back to the Church
[0:56:03] <The_hidden_> 'member star wars
[0:56:11] <%Valdorick> Sometimes it was not easier. Weren't checking shit when your ship gets yeeted into space on the Water Wind Planet... or when it exists in the blackhole.
[0:56:23] <%RayReborne> man im not an explorer type game guy but this all seems cool as shit
[0:56:26] <%Daxalog> Does the first game not end with you fix the time loop thing? I never played this.
[0:56:29] <vVAstrAVv> only babies use the markers
[0:56:37] <AoiRob> dont smash the ship
[0:56:42] <leole11> @Daxalog it does not
[0:56:59] <Riyokuno> do not bonk
[0:57:22] <%RayReborne> ok entering from more than one spot is super convenient
[0:57:23] <Lajong_z> i always almost die landing on that thing
[0:57:24] <%VHGS> yes
[0:57:25] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's the church
[0:57:26] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yeah
[0:57:26] <%DrTomT18> yes
[0:57:29] <ZE_Count> yep
[0:57:34] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you gotta solve the mystery yourself, pat
[0:57:34] <+blaze__drag> of course they are
[0:57:38] <leole11> get trolled nerd
[0:57:38] <+blaze__drag> you think they'd make it that easy?
[0:57:38] <MyNameIsRasus> @daxalog i mean you "fix" it
[0:57:42] <CrematedCube> Use that brain
[0:57:46] <ZE_Count> their secret pat
[0:57:48] <Lajong_z> solve the puzzle for you why dont they
[0:57:50] <$ringabal> We're doomed
[0:57:50] <Riyokuno> brain time
[0:57:52] <+blaze__drag> time for brain time
[0:57:57] <ZE_Count> use the grey matter
[0:57:58] <vVAstrAVv> oh no. thinking
[0:57:59] <danraven> at least you're near one of the marks
[0:57:59] <AoiRob> use your thinkmeat
[0:58:04] <%tank7013> @Daxalog Also this is a large DLC not a sequel so vanilla Outer Wilds is still happening right now
[0:58:04] <The_hidden_> ok brain you don't like me and i don't like you
[0:58:07] <tanarath> @daxalog Spoilers, either watch Pat's playthrough on youtube or play it yourself, it's one of the best games in the past few years, though.
[0:58:14] <+upandadam> dark souls
[0:58:15] <leole11> pat's brain's cubic size cannot be accurately measured
[0:58:17] <+TombstoneTTromboners> woo!
[0:58:18] <+upandadam> REFERENCE
[0:58:20] <Riyokuno> first try
[0:58:21] <cheapdoc> SOULS
[0:58:21] <%G_Thunders> Member Dark Souls?
[0:58:27] <vVAstrAVv> dun dun dun, dun dun, dun dun dun
[0:58:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> OH NO
[0:58:38] <$ringabal> NOPE
[0:58:41] <@GeneralSCPatton> I hope this gives us an alternate ending
[0:58:42] <cheapdoc> heh
[0:58:43] <%Dopamien> lmao
[0:58:44] <$ringabal> NU UH
[0:58:49] <$ringabal> LETS NOT
[0:58:49] <leole11> get stuck nerd
[0:58:52] <AoiRob> trapped
[0:58:59] <Riyokuno> EZ
[0:59:00] <%Buzzard42> rekt
[0:59:04] <leole11> lmao
[0:59:07] <+Pequod1> god this game is so good
[0:59:07] <%Frost_Quill> Oh yeah I think you can accidentally trap yourself here if you put the lamp in the wrong spot.
[0:59:08] <Lajong_z> too smart
[0:59:08] <AoiRob> lmao
[0:59:10] <not_twitter_rowan> that's super cool
[0:59:13] <%TarikBot> Awesome instant solve!
[0:59:15] <+Delenay> using the scout like that is such a fucking awesome solution
[0:59:15] <ZE_Count> skillz
[0:59:16] <AoiRob> to the movie room!
[0:59:17] <cheapdoc> The did not expect a BETTER light space man
[0:59:28] <danraven> fuckers never expected the remote flashlight
[0:59:39] <$dalmek> full of bright ideas
[0:59:39] <%Agami23> imagine if you showed these birdmen a flashlight
[0:59:42] <Lajong_z> how can u project light if our eyes arent real
[0:59:42] <karl_rex> Does the dlc still have the time loop?
[0:59:45] <%derpy_platypus> literally still more advanced than you tho
[0:59:48] <$ringabal> Technology ALWAYS beats magic
[0:59:49] <+redyoshi5> i still have no idea why he goes the long way every time
[0:59:54] <leole11> @karl_rex yes
[0:59:54] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:59:54] <Saltmeisterr> @karl_rex Ye
[1:00:06] <+extantCadence> That trap setup probably seemed a lot more devious when they made it, what with the wall not having a massive hole in it
[1:00:12] <%DrTomT18> that's kinda what Project Hail Mary is about
[1:00:16] <%Daxalog> I love the idea everyone has a different Tech Tree.
[1:00:17] <AoiRob> using your hands is for losers
[1:00:19] <ZE_Count> I always liked that bit in Stargate when the grey aliens think bullets and guns are cool.
[1:00:26] <$ringabal> Imagine jetpacking through an Indiana Jones temple
[1:00:30] <cheapdoc> Maybe you never made a fleshlight
[1:00:32] <+TombstoneTTromboners> time for spooks
[1:00:32] <+blaze__drag> I mean I think the implication is that these guys are nocturnal as well
[1:00:35] <KasiCrafter> one makes QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY, and the other just made home movies
[1:00:37] <%Alazull> Maybe they never needed them
[1:00:40] <+TombstoneTTromboners> "see ya fucker"
[1:00:40] <leole11> oh this one
[1:00:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> who needs flashlights when you can create light with your life force or whatever
[1:00:45] <%Buzzard42> the notion that a civilization can be technologically stunted in one aspect but be so advanced in another that it borders on magic kicks ass
[1:00:46] <%tank7013> That artifact kinda IS them inventing a flashlight
[1:00:48] <%Monkeyweed21> no need for flashlights if everyone can shoot light out of their eyes
[1:00:50] <+TombstoneTTromboners> INVISI BRIDGE
[1:00:53] <%Valdorick> Pog of faith
[1:00:53] <%Piemen99> Why need a flash light when you can see in the dark
[1:00:54] <%JonathLP> INVISIBLE BRIDGE
[1:00:55] <%VHGS> FUCK gravity
[1:00:56] <%Frost_Quill> oh
[1:00:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> INDIANA JONES SHIT
[1:00:57] <leole11> you can just WALK?
[1:00:58] <%Buzzard42> SECRET BRIDGE
[1:00:59] <Riyokuno> here we go
[1:00:59] <AoiRob> lmao zelda puzzle
[1:01:01] <nomos42> Okay so I missed this entire hint set and had to figure this shit out on my own
[1:01:02] <%Piemen99> OH
[1:01:04] <CrematedCube> We playing Majora's Mask for real
[1:01:04] <%barrakuta371> War of the Worlds is like that, the Martians never invented the wheel so they made machines with legs
[1:01:08] <%Like51bears> thats 1
[1:01:08] <iosephe> It is time
[1:01:08] <ZE_Count> KNOWLEDGE GAINED

[1:01:36] <Louie_Salmon> @nomos42 Figure out an invisible bridge on your own? That's nuts
[1:01:40] <%Buzzard42> the classic Leap of Faith bridge
[1:01:42] <MyNameIsRasus> WHERE ARE YOU GOING LUL
[1:01:51] <%Frost_Quill> He doesn't have an artifact.
[1:01:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt there was an artifact right there you could have gone right away
[1:01:53] <ZE_Count> he got to find all the secrets
[1:01:54] <+TombstoneTTromboners> he's gonna go find the other reels
[1:01:55] <%DrTomT18> the one you just watched the Reel of
[1:01:57] <$dalmek> the other stuff on the map projections
[1:01:58] <AoiRob> well where u goin
[1:01:58] <Riyokuno> he's getting all the secrets
[1:01:58] <%RealThiele> but raft tho
[1:01:58] <%Valdorick> He wants to explore the OTHER hidden locations, guys.
[1:01:59] <%tank7013> To the other spots?
[1:02:01] <HiveMasterMind> Going to the other 2 hidden spots
[1:02:03] <%tank7013> Ay I was right
[1:02:06] <%Dakuu75> ♪♪"Maaanteca water slides~ Slip'n & Slide'n, leave your cares behind~" ♪♪
[1:02:11] <ZE_Count> he gotta know
[1:02:12] <%DrTomT18> check the Dam!
[1:02:12] <AoiRob> fair enough
[1:02:14] <%JonathLP> brain = ship log
[1:02:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh that makes sense
[1:02:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> good idea
[1:02:19] <%AncelDeLambert> but Pat brain baby brain
[1:02:21] <+blaze__drag> are you sure your brain can hold 3 things at once?
[1:02:22] <Edsta94> yeah stop backseating let the man do his thing
[1:02:22] <%Alazull> This game reminds me of Myst a little
[1:02:22] <AoiRob> gotta feed the brain
[1:02:25] <leole11> i love this nice little ride :)
[1:02:26] <bippityjones> But does your brain remember where the other secrets are?
[1:02:28] <+TombstoneTTromboners> 100% baby
[1:02:29] <CrematedCube> Okay yeah fair
[1:02:30] <%tank7013> Huh?
[1:02:32] <%derpy_platypus> its not like the whole point is the gather knowledge for a single run.... nah
[1:02:32] <cheapdoc> wut
[1:02:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> I wonder what happens if the dam breaks while you're riding this elevator
[1:02:35] <%DrTomT18> Making good time!
[1:02:35] <vVAstrAVv> safe in his perfect brain
[1:02:37] <%Valdorick> Huh...
[1:02:39] <+Delenay> solar power is when it breaks?
[1:02:40] <+Pequod1> Something... happens to make the bridge break
[1:02:41] <%Monkeyweed21> so that he can forget about 1 and chat will have to remind him
[1:02:44] <nomos42> I think it's cos it's not accelerating yet
[1:02:45] <HiveMasterMind> Give it a bit
[1:02:47] <+redyoshi5> it does not start breaking till later
[1:02:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @Alazull this game is basically myst meets majora's mask in space
[1:02:48] <leole11> yeah don't worry about it
[1:02:52] <Lajong_z> @ReallyBigRocks it happened to me lol yeeted me far
[1:02:54] <AoiRob> the power hasnt flickered yet ig
[1:03:06] <%DrTomT18> 200 IQ
[1:03:09] <%Monkeyweed21> dam doesnt start breaking until the solar sails start moving the ship
[1:03:09] <Riyokuno> there it goes
[1:03:11] <%tank7013> Oh so whoever I was talking to last time was right then
[1:03:12] <cheapdoc> NOW you have 100 seconds
[1:03:12] <+Delenay> you past it
[1:03:12] <%Buzzard42> the sails opening jostles the dam, yeah
[1:03:14] <tanarath> big brute smart brain
[1:03:16] <+Delenay> the trees
[1:03:20] <+Pequod1> I think it just breaks the dam, does't necessarily take more power
[1:03:21] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the photo was taken in the past
[1:03:21] <Riyokuno> it is
[1:03:21] <ZE_Count> you gotta explore

[1:08:32] <+TombstoneTTromboners> SPACE SECRETS
[1:08:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> 100% biff
[1:08:36] <KasiCrafter> The best way to waste time is by trying not to waste time

[1:08:39] <stoatacious> tick tock tick tock, time is ticking down

[1:08:57] <+extantCadence> @Dakuu75 More or less that. Mostly less.
[1:08:57] <bippityjones> Imported Nature
[1:08:58] <%derpy_platypus> literally right ..... now
[1:08:59] <+Pequod1> the forces of nature
[1:09:00] <%Valdorick> Racing Antenature

[1:09:02] <%Deadpal> oh god
[1:09:03] <%Frost_Quill> Now wh ere was the slide
[1:09:04] <cheapdoc> Racing the racists
[1:09:04] <+blaze__drag> everything about this place is natural
[1:09:06] <RoughBoulder22> it's entropy decaying the bridge, so yes
[1:09:07] <+blaze__drag> obviously
[1:09:08] <%Deadpal> RULES OF NATUREEE
[1:09:14] <AluxStreams> This is gonna be *reel* close.
[1:09:15] <AoiRob> RUUUUNNNNN
[1:09:17] <%Deadpal> yeahhhhhh
[1:09:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> nothing about this place is natural its a space station
[1:09:18] <Edsta94> the sun is natural
[1:09:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he did it
[1:09:49] <%Deadpal> SECRET HAND.
[1:09:57] <%Buzzard42> SECRET
[1:10:01] <%Deadpal> GG
[1:10:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> into the pit
[1:10:09] <+TombstoneTTromboners> SECRET TUNNELLLL
[1:10:09] <$ringabal> There was a hole here
[1:10:10] <%Valdorick> Ah, and that blocked the alarm bell. rad
[1:10:10] <%Frost_Quill> so invisible bridge, fire, and secret hand
[1:10:11] <AoiRob> HOOOL
[1:10:11] <bippityjones> MYSTERY HOLE
[1:10:13] <cheapdoc> Why the damn not breaking?
[1:10:15] <%Buzzard42> dam's still up
[1:10:16] <+Yamchadassist> imagine findin some of this out of order
[1:10:17] <%JoshManVGH> Fake fire, secret hand
[1:10:18] <%Deadpal> yeah
[1:10:20] <%Deadpal> good idea
[1:10:20] <RoughBoulder22> "hey, who turned out the lights" LUL
[1:10:23] <%DrTomT18> you co- nevermind
[1:10:26] <%baka_sugoi> time to DIW
[1:10:27] <thetntm> dam break blue balls
[1:10:28] <AoiRob> INTO THE NIGHTMARE DARKNESS REALM
[1:10:29] <Riyokuno> it just broke LUL
[1:10:30] <%Deadpal> ROUGH NO.
[1:10:31] <+blaze__drag> lol
[1:10:34] <%Piemen99> Oh yo we had tons of time
[1:10:37] <+blaze__drag> you could hear the dam break as you fell asleep
[1:10:38] <harmless_toast> I think that was the dam breaking just as it faded out
[1:10:38] <%Deadpal> @RoughBoulder22 I WOULD DIE.
[1:10:39] <+Pequod1> maybe the cliff tample but time is shortt
[1:10:40] <KasiCrafter> Wasn't there an area unaffected by the floding?
[1:10:43] <leole11> secret hand, secret fire and secret bridge
[1:10:43] <Louie_Salmon> Dying is always a valid strategy.
[1:10:46] <%Piemen99> Aint no dam gonna keep us down
[1:10:46] <+blaze__drag> that's some pretty deep meditation
[1:10:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now to the good stuff
[1:10:50] <ZE_Count> I like the shadow realm it remidns be of yugioh
[1:10:50] <%Deadpal> if they brought the Vashta Narada in to this?
[1:10:52] <+TombstoneTTromboners> secrets: revealed
[1:10:53] <bippityjones> And now the part of the DLC that people are most likely to just bounce off of and stop playing
[1:11:02] <harmless_toast> it's impressive that you can meditate through being swept away by a wave
[1:11:03] <CrematedCube> These secrets are the last thing I learned, so we're in the new scary for me
[1:11:03] <nomos42> @PatStaresAt I had to work these secrets out via brute smarts, was not as fun but felt cool when I did
[1:11:03] <$realm_forge> I feel the same way when my insomnia kicks in
[1:11:04] <Louie_Salmon> They can't kill you if you're dead. The ultimate defense.
[1:11:10] <%Monkeyweed21> starlit cove seems like a good start
[1:11:10] <+blaze__drag> remember when realizing the cannon moves was the biggest deal?
[1:11:10] <%Piemen99> keep us from learning space secrets
[1:11:13] <+extantCadence> The dam stays in the damaged state for quite a while before it finally goes
[1:11:15] <%Deadpal> YEAHHHH
[1:11:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @bippityjones i almost did, first from fear then from frustration lol
[1:11:19] <leole11> as little as i like spook games, i enjoyed these next bits
[1:11:21] <AoiRob> cliff mansion dream doesnt get wrecked by the flood so there first?
[1:11:29] <%Frost_Quill> @harmless_toast I mean you can meditate through being engulfed by the sun.
[1:11:34] <%Deadpal> it totally is
[1:11:40] <%Deadpal> endless canyon is so cool and sneaky
[1:11:45] <Treasure_Vault> Dude waking up next to the campfire, talking about the invisible halo full of dreams and running towards the spaceship at turbo

[1:12:47] <+RyuMojo> This game has a dlc? How have I never heard of this
[1:12:57] <RoughBoulder22> it came out 28th
[1:13:03] <$dalmek> @RyuMojo it came out a few days ago
[1:13:04] <+Pequod1> @RyuMojo just came out l
[1:13:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RyuMojo came out like 3 days ago
[1:13:04] <thetntm> @RyuMojo it came out like yesterday
[1:13:47] <%Mr_Pylon> and it's perfectly positioned for a straight shot from takeout
[1:13:55] <The_hidden_> vroom
[1:13:58] <%Mr_Pylon> takeoff
[1:14:00] <buhbuhboat> grab the artifact first
[1:14:02] <+Pequod1> artifact?
[1:14:05] <CrematedCube> Remember the artefact
[1:14:06] <stoatacious> artifact?
[1:14:07] <+TombstoneTTromboners> JUICIN
[1:14:08] <%Monkeyweed21> artifact
[1:14:08] <%Agami23> my only question is, why is there jetpack fuel all over?
[1:14:09] <Riyokuno> no artifact?
[1:14:12] <stoatacious> uhhhhh
[1:14:12] <%DrTomT18> love this river riding music
[1:14:13] <RoughBoulder22> LUL forgor
[1:14:15] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt you seen any of the kof stuff?
[1:14:16] <karl_rex> ye future river raft
[1:14:17] <%Buzzard42> LUL
[1:14:21] <+Pequod1> lulw
[1:14:23] <%Buzzard42> beaned
[1:14:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> ankles destroyed
[1:14:27] <%buerdo> Juice it
[1:14:29] <harmless_toast> there's an artifact in the projector room at the canyon...
[1:14:34] <tanarath> Galaxy brain
[1:14:36] <%dasmause> is pat playing with reduced frights or no
[1:14:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> it was a healthy crunch
[1:14:55] <shotgang86> I just arrive in time for:  "Remember the artifact? .... SHIT!"
[1:14:56] <+Pequod1> @dasmause Still curious what it does
[1:14:56] <CrematedCube> No, not yet at least
[1:15:00] <IHaveNoFunnyName> @Agami23 In the case of the burnt out church it's flamethrower fuel you repurpose
[1:15:04] <teebos> no baby mode here
[1:15:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @harmless_toast he hasnt found an artifact near the tower yet, so he needs to pick up this one
[1:15:07] <vVAstrAVv> @dasmause he plays resident evil to chill what do you think
[1:15:10] <iosephe> reduced flights tho
[1:15:15] <ZE_Count> tick tock
[1:15:19] <buhbuhboat> reduced frights is basically easy mode
[1:15:20] <harmless_toast> If you jump with A before boosting you can go a lot higher/further
[1:15:22] <%Piemen99> ay 3rd times a charm
[1:15:25] <%dasmause> resident evil is comfy game, this is scary though
[1:15:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> might as well restart the run Kappa
[1:15:26] <%DrTomT18> every second counts
[1:15:29] <cheapdoc> You might as well start over
[1:15:41] <%YakumoYomi> Whore roar, you say?
[1:15:42] <harmless_toast> @Monkeyweed21 he has, he walked past it five minutes ago, and pointed it out on the previous stream.
[1:15:43] <%tank7013> What game was it you had Paige beat for you because you were to scared again?
[1:15:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat have you SEEN some people play horror games?
[1:15:46] <RoughBoulder22> when he beats this I've got a theory to tell if they want it, it makes things REALLY sad if it's true
[1:15:50] <$dalmek> you want the intended amount of pissing and shitting
[1:15:51] <RyuuAoi> These new fans don't know about Shitstorm ha
[1:15:53] <%Buzzard42> don't turn off spooks
[1:15:57] <%jtdobyns> There has not really been any spooks yet
[1:15:59] <Calek> @tank7013 PT
[1:15:59] <krackman245> CoolCat
[1:16:00] <RyuuAoi> It's Babby Pat season!
[1:16:03] <%Buzzard42> Soma is the BEST
[1:16:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh man i love soma
[1:16:14] <%Deadpal> I agree 100% pat.
[1:16:20] <%dasmause> soma is existential horror, enemies almost get in the way
[1:16:23] <%tank7013> @Calek Riiight that was it. Thanks
[1:16:25] <%Deadpal> it's cool for some people
[1:16:25] <%Buzzard42> Soma's writing is the best part
[1:16:29] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> It just makes it harder for them to detect you
[1:16:30] <%Buzzard42> SOma would almost be better as a book
[1:16:31] <leole11> ohhhh boy....
[1:16:31] <%Deadpal> but for others it stops me from enjoying the game.
[1:16:31] <%Puhff> YUP
[1:16:34] <%Deadpal> yeah.
[1:16:38] <%Deadpal> when you fail it like 5 times?
[1:16:41] <%jtdobyns> I think being underwater in the ocean is the worst part
[1:16:41] <The_hidden_> plot twist this is an Alan Wake story
[1:16:42] <%Frost_Quill> The worst spook so far was a chill bird guy just blowing out our lantern.  And the weird singing.
[1:16:45] <%Deadpal> you are still freaking out and fail at it?
[1:16:47] <Calek> @leole11 puccaSip
[1:16:48] <%Deadpal> Just fucking let me skip it.
[1:16:49] <+TombstoneTTromboners> zzzzzzzzzz
[1:16:53] <shotgang86> zangief is calling
[1:16:56] <%valriot> Theres horror, and then theres "horror" thats just "haha dumb player get spooked by our bad design"
[1:16:57] <%sporeian94> what about amnesia isn't that basically the original soma?
[1:16:59] <RoughBoulder22> no comment on how that applies here
[1:17:01] <%Deadpal> I'm annoyed. I get it. I enjoyed the scares the first time.
[1:17:06] <%Deadpal> but 5 times In I'm fucking done with it.
[1:17:06] <%Monkeyweed21> the only good one is that giant fish freak at the bottom of the abyss
[1:17:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no
[1:17:10] <+Delenay> no secret hand
[1:17:11] <thetntm> nope
[1:17:13] <%DrTomT18> yeah
[1:17:14] <%Deadpal> @valriot precisely.
[1:17:14] <$dalmek> secret hand
[1:17:15] <teebos> no
[1:17:16] <%tank7013> That's how I feel about all of those "can't fight back" horror games
[1:17:16] <%Buzzard42> leave spooks on at all times for maximum enjoyment
[1:17:18] <foxenco> no, secret hand
[1:17:19] <Saltmeisterr> SECRET HAND
[1:17:21] <%Deadpal> oh wait
[1:17:22] <stoatacious> non spook mode is kinda like soma's, it's like turning on easy mode
[1:17:23] <The_hidden_> the hidden hand
[1:17:23] <leole11> this isn't the fireplace
[1:17:25] <bippityjones> Mystery Hole
[1:17:28] <%Deadpal> did pat not look through this?
[1:17:29] <Riyokuno> the wall hand
[1:17:29] <buhbuhboat> hand on the raft
[1:17:38] <The_hidden_> mystery glory hole
[1:17:40] <cheapdoc> Your job is to find the secret hand ... you could say it's a secret hand job
[1:17:40] <RiverBirch> So chat
[1:17:41] <%Deadpal> on the raft near here?
[1:17:42] <%dasmause> @Pequod1 i could tell you but im not sure how much of that is spoiler for pat
[1:17:45] <RiverBirch> What do ya'll think about this DLC?
[1:17:45] <%Deadpal> yeah.
[1:17:51] <%DrTomT18> you need to find a burned building
[1:17:55] <leole11> you passed it
[1:17:57] <%YakumoYomi> @cheapdoc psaSmug
[1:18:02] <Riyokuno> LUL
[1:18:03] <foxenco> too far
[1:18:04] <nomos42> why
[1:18:07] <Calek> @RiverBirch ended up not liking it at all
[1:18:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do you remember where the raft is
[1:18:10] <vVAstrAVv> you already missed it
[1:18:14] <%Buzzard42> andyThinking
[1:18:15] <foxenco> lol
[1:18:15] <IHaveNoFunnyName> I felt the same things I felt about the base game with the DLC so 10/10
[1:18:19] <%Deadpal> rip
[1:18:20] <%Frost_Quill> what was in the hole
[1:18:20] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[1:18:21] <leole11> that ain't going to work
[1:18:21] <%Deadpal> yeah
[1:18:22] <2midgetsinacoat> you get to it without teleportation
[1:18:24] <%Deadpal> keep looking.
[1:18:25] <RiverBirch> @Calek Awh, sorry to hear that
[1:18:30] <+Pequod1> @dasmause fair
[1:18:30] <%Piemen99> KEKW
[1:18:31] <+TombstoneTTromboners> get a searchin then
[1:18:32] <%Deadpal> This will work eventually
[1:18:35] <+Delenay> it was by a telescope?
[1:18:36] <%derpy_platypus> where boat?
[1:18:37] <foxenco> Go right but don't take the hand
[1:18:39] <leole11> it's right before the hand
[1:18:53] <CrematedCube> It'll be downstairs
[1:18:55] <+Delenay> lower floor?
[1:18:56] <vVAstrAVv> look for stairs

[1:24:18] <HyperionXV> raysL
[1:24:19] <HiveMasterMind> I hate that they have teeth
[1:24:19] <%Deadpal> no
[1:24:20] <+BloodyBurney> i screamed lol
[1:24:22] <%Deadpal> don't reduce frights
[1:24:22] <Riyokuno> let him
[1:24:24] <leole11> son of a bitch i shit myself
[1:24:25] <Saltmeisterr> SPOOPY
[1:24:25] <%Puhff> AH
[1:24:25] <cheapdoc> Fucking spawn farming
[1:24:27] <+blaze__drag> you're super good at making first contact with these aliens
[1:24:28] <2midgetsinacoat> Strangerchads > Nomaivirgins
[1:24:30] <stoatacious> you could turn on eeasy mode
[1:24:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ai get dumber
[1:24:30] <%DrTomT18> Makes them less agressive
[1:24:31] <ZE_Count> makes them slower I think
[1:24:31] <Riyokuno> it makes the AI dumber
[1:24:31] <Tisaric> makes them trivial
[1:24:32] <$realm_forge> SQUEAK
[1:24:32] <%drabberfaun535> were chozo always this rude?
[1:24:33] <%Deadpal> It slows them and they're less aggresive.
[1:24:34] <mrapplebucks> 69 accounts remaining
[1:24:34] <%Frost_Quill> makes them easier to juke and dodge
[1:24:34] <RoughBoulder22> slower enemies I think
[1:24:35] <teebos> makes them slower
[1:24:36] <AoiRob> why do the birds have teeth
[1:24:37] <+TombstoneTTromboners> they become super slow
[1:24:38] <stoatacious> reduced frights is baby easy mode
[1:24:39] <%NateyBeak> they do not run, they only walk. they will not use their spotlight
[1:24:40] <nomos42> slows them down and they don't make scary noise
[1:24:41] <foxenco> Slower birds
[1:24:41] <buhbuhboat> makes them not run at you or make scary noise
[1:24:42] <%Like51bears> its a baby mode for babies
[1:24:43] <%DrTomT18> stupider
[1:24:43] <harmless_toast> reduced firghts basically just makes them dumb and slow. They wont run or focus their light on you
[1:24:43] <%Axellogic> They cant see you with their light and they cant grab you from as far
[1:24:44] <AoiRob> slower
[1:24:44] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt it makes owlmen way less perceptive, WAY WAY slower and turns off the dead space music
[1:24:44] <$dalmek> they walk instead of run, basically
[1:24:46] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt slows them down a bunch and reduces the sounds they make
[1:24:48] <ZE_Count> their still there but dumber and slower
[1:24:48] <Explodincatz> makes it harder
[1:24:56] <%NateyBeak> do it join us in the coward corner
[1:24:59] <stoatacious> easy mode is now abailable
[1:25:00] <%derpy_platypus> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[1:25:01] <harmless_toast> yeah, it mostly makes things easier rather than less scary
[1:25:02] <+Pequod1> the stealth is kind of lame
[1:25:03] <%Dopamien> CoolStoryBob
[1:25:03] <+blaze__drag> because you're baby?
[1:25:08] <%Piemen99> DONT BE A BITCH
[1:25:12] <AoiRob> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[1:25:12] <+TombstoneTTromboners> bait and switch him
[1:25:14] <+extantCadence> Pat cowarding out
[1:25:15] <%Monkeyweed21> yea sure "funsies"
[1:25:16] <cheapdoc> Roses are delectable
[1:25:19] <+TombstoneTTromboners> RUN
[1:25:20] <%Valdorick> HAHA
[1:25:21] <%bassoontyphoon> Be a coward
[1:25:22] <+Pequod1> breka line of sight
[1:25:23] <%derpy_platypus> run
[1:25:26] <+TombstoneTTromboners> "hey man"
[1:25:29] <harmless_toast> he can see you when he's focusing his light on you!
[1:25:32] <%sporeian94> how are you suppose to even beat them?
[1:25:32] <%DrTomT18> rude owl man
[1:25:33] <+Delenay> you could have kept going
[1:25:33] <%Axellogic> They have lights too
[1:25:33] <+redyoshi5> pat he is shining a light on you what are you doing
[1:25:33] <bippityjones> His lantern was pointed right at you lol
[1:25:35] <RoughBoulder22> he was testing the mechanics chat
[1:25:35] <nomos42> they do seem to hard to spot, like you should be able to see their lanters right?
[1:25:35] <%Valdorick> If its like that, they're focusing.
[1:25:35] <+Delenay> that was a circle area
[1:25:36] <ZE_Count> you could of just went around
[1:25:36] <thetntm> if you can see their light they can see you
[1:25:37] <buhbuhboat> stealth sections are actually kinda hard
[1:25:38] <The_hidden_> this is the part of the game everyone loves
[1:25:38] <foxenco> they can see you with their lantern
[1:25:38] <Riyokuno> if you don't want to repeat these sections because how often they take you, that's the option for you
[1:25:42] <%JonathLP> "Dude why do you keep coming here?"
[1:25:45] <%Dakuu75> why are they hostile? we didn't do nuthin to them.
[1:25:46] <mrapplebucks> 68 alternate accounts
[1:25:47] <vVAstrAVv> pat its run not hide
[1:25:48] <$ringabal> "Stop hitting the snooze button, Hearthian!"
[1:25:49] <Explodincatz> hahaha enjoy
[1:25:50] <+blaze__drag> maybe try not standing still while he shines a light on you?
[1:25:50] <+Delenay> you could have just walked down the path you were on and gone left
[1:25:52] <+TombstoneTTromboners> a little tilt
[1:25:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the waaave
[1:25:54] <leole11> don't let him point his light at you
[1:25:56] <AoiRob> kinda hard to stealth when you cant even see the floor
[1:26:00] <+Delenay> that was a circle
[1:26:03] <bippityjones> It's both
[1:26:04] <%derpy_platypus> juke around rock
[1:26:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt that eara is a ring you can go around him
[1:26:06] <+JustToWatch> no it's run and hide
[1:26:06] <ZE_Count> prob should map out the area in your mind first
[1:26:10] <%Deadpal> more like hide then run.
[1:26:10] <vVAstrAVv> lure him then go around
[1:26:12] <%Monkeyweed21> area
[1:26:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @AoiRob ya that's why this part kinda sucks
[1:26:17] <thetntm> they have a period of time wehre they don't see you
[1:26:19] <The_hidden_> run & hide
[1:26:19] <buhbuhboat> you gotta lure him out and then go behind him
[1:26:22] <%Dakuu75> easyier said than done
[1:26:23] <%JonathLP> Use your mind palace pat
[1:26:23] <FleshFriend> bad brain
[1:26:24] <%Frost_Quill> i'm guessing he can focus HIS light too just like the player can
[1:26:24] <heartlesshealer> it's both
[1:26:29] <buhbuhboat> hard part is that you can't see shit
[1:26:31] <$ringabal> OH NO
[1:26:33] <RoughBoulder22> @Dakuu75 they're protecting what's sealed, remember
[1:26:36] <%Valdorick> ARE YOU!?

[1:27:43] <bippityjones> You've got half the loop
[1:27:47] <%Deadpal> you have time before it falls over
[1:27:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TombstoneTTromboners :)
[1:27:48] <%DrTomT18> I think you got time

[1:27:59] <+RyuMojo> That got me good
[1:27:59] <%DrTomT18> FUCK THAT GOT ME
[1:27:59] <IHaveNoFunnyName> This part of the game doesn't suck you're just not supposed to mash your head against something in outer wilds, if you're stuck do something else and come back
[1:28:00] <%Mr_Pylon> okay that got me
[1:28:01] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> That got me
[1:28:02] <+Yamchadassist> that got me
[1:28:05] <$ringabal> THE DIORAMA IS CLOSED, JACKASS
[1:28:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> idk what spooked me more, the owl or Pat
[1:28:06] <+Delenay> that fucking got me
[1:28:06] <%RayReborne> welp, time for loops
[1:28:08] <vVAstrAVv> it falls over at the EEEND of the loop
[1:28:11] <harmless_toast> you watched one of the elevators go through a hole in the ground...
[1:28:11] <mrapplebucks> 67 ACCOUNTS
[1:28:12] <tanarath> me too
[1:28:12] <heartlesshealer> DAMMIT
[1:28:13] <FleshFriend> he was WAITING for ya LUL
[1:28:13] <leole11> scares the crap out of me
[1:28:14] <The_hidden_> can't keep light on all the time
[1:28:15] <%Puhff> FUCK
[1:28:16] <%derpy_platypus> PANIC MODE ENGAGE
[1:28:16] <stoatacious> reduced frights for the streams sake?
[1:28:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ReallyBigRocks def pat
[1:28:21] <+blaze__drag> you got dis
[1:28:23] <vVAstrAVv> theres a bunch down there
[1:28:31] <ZE_Count> I think it falls at 21 min?
[1:28:32] <RyuuAoi> @stoatacious No!
[1:28:33] <foxenco> you got this man
[1:28:33] <+Slimperton> i cant believe outer wilds is straight-up horror now
[1:28:35] <+BloodyBurney> whoever said we were in the clear lied
[1:28:36] <AoiRob> big room with lots of corridors? didnt think theyd be there
[1:28:38] <%DrTomT18> yeah,seriously
[1:28:38] <$dalmek> anglerfish
[1:28:38] <%Deadpal> yeah
[1:28:39] <%VHGS> except those asshole fish
[1:28:39] <iosephe> Except for Anglerfish
[1:28:39] <vVAstrAVv> this is like the hardest one
[1:28:39] <2midgetsinacoat> @stoatacious keep it on for entertainment's sake
[1:28:40] <%Frost_Quill> Other than the anglerfish.
[1:28:41] <not_twitter_rowan> uh
[1:28:41] <nomos42> apart from anglerfish
[1:28:43] <%Deadpal> this stuff stopped me for about 5 hours.
[1:28:43] <thetntm> there are anglerfish
[1:28:44] <%bassoontyphoon> They can’t keep getting away with this
[1:28:44] <%DrTomT18> I get wanting to do something different but eh
[1:28:45] <Riyokuno> well, there are the giant fish
[1:28:46] <not_twitter_rowan> the anglerfish?
[1:28:46] <ZE_Count> I mean the fish
[1:28:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> @cobalt_phoenix_ I think both at the same time is what really did it lmao
[1:28:47] <RoughBoulder22> @mrapplebucks I se what you're doing there, spoiler boiler
[1:28:47] <IzanagiNoOokami> Blow out his lantern and damn him to spirit death.
[1:28:47] <+RyuMojo> Angler fish? 🌝 🌝
[1:28:47] <harmless_toast> except the angler fish, which these basically work like
[1:28:49] <tanarath> mmmm, there is in bramble
[1:28:50] <AoiRob> well except...
[1:28:52] <foxenco> It's more agressive fish
[1:28:53] <$dalmek> that is true
[1:28:55] <%tank7013> And those are way more terrifying
[1:28:55] <iosephe> Oh definitely
[1:28:56] <vVAstrAVv> dark bramble
[1:28:58] <+Slimperton> having a sapient, humanoid predator is very different
[1:29:01] <+rafaelba93> fish are a puzzlew
[1:29:02] <+upandadam> i like them trying something different, but i don't like this kind of amnesia-like gameplay
[1:29:03] <+TombstoneTTromboners> RUN PAT RUN
[1:29:04] <Explodincatz> litterally took all your tools away
[1:29:06] <buhbuhboat> anglerfish have a single thing that nullifies them whereas this is full on stealth
[1:29:08] <+blaze__drag> there's also the enemy of the inevitability of entropy and death
[1:29:10] <vVAstrAVv> tru
[1:29:11] <danraven> at least this one doesn't reset the loop if you fail
[1:29:12] <Louie_Salmon> And anglers are basically a puzzle that you solve once, not an actual stealth enemy.
[1:29:12] <+upandadam> that's fucked
[1:29:14] <The_hidden_> sup bro
[1:29:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> good try
[1:29:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> he got long legs
[1:29:17] <harmless_toast> they're taller and faster than you
[1:29:18] <%Deadpal> oh my god they're so fast with that option turned off.
[1:29:21] <AluxStreams> Good to know they can outrun you at least.
[1:29:28] <%DrTomT18> fucking owls
[1:29:28] <+blaze__drag> is it just me or are they blowing your light out faster
[1:29:29] <+JustToWatch> they have much longer legs than you
[1:29:32] <mrapplebucks> 66 ACCOUNTS REMAINING
[1:29:33] <+blaze__drag> they must be getting tired
[1:29:34] <heartlesshealer> they're fast
[1:29:35] <stoatacious> I want to cuddle the big owls
[1:29:36] <+Pequod1> turning off the light and break line of sight is key
[1:29:36] <cheapdoc> Easy mode is now selectable?
[1:29:37] <%jtdobyns> Mght have to do this one last?
[1:29:39] <Ben_Lunaris> SaltyCorn rbzLul
[1:29:39] <teebos> wow yeah, they're super fast
[1:29:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're just a little guy
[1:29:45] <ZE_Count> I think it might be time to reset
[1:29:46] <%derpy_platypus> get his attention, then juke right
[1:29:51] <foxenco> they only start running when you're near, if you shine them a little they don't run
[1:29:52] <+redyoshi5> i believe they run at the same speed so as long as you dont mess up they cant catch you
[1:29:53] <nomos42> @jtdobyns the others are similar
[1:29:54] <PKLoveLucas> pat use the beam, it lets you see them from far enough away that they can't catch you
[1:29:54] <vVAstrAVv> pat focus your light to lure them from far away without making them aggressive
[1:29:54] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:29:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea after multiple deaths they go faster to save you time
[1:29:56] <heartlesshealer> oh of course, they have longer legs and bigger strides
[1:29:57] <%whyskeywolfe> You’d think Pat would have more experience being a little guy running from big scary guys.
[1:29:58] <FleshFriend> These guys must be really annoyed. Some 4 eyed dwarf alien is running around solving their puzzles n shit
[1:30:01] <Louie_Salmon> Hmmmm
[1:30:03] <%Deadpal> the-
[1:30:03] <%DrTomT18> They never woke up
[1:30:05] <%Deadpal> hm.
[1:30:06] <+TombstoneTTromboners> :)
[1:30:06] <%NateyBeak> HMM
[1:30:07] <The_hidden_> good question
[1:30:07] <RoughBoulder22> hmm
[1:30:08] <thetntm> the water puts out the flame
[1:30:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> who knows
[1:30:09] <nomos42> idk magic
[1:30:09] <%drabberfaun535> commitment
[1:30:09] <%Deadpal> good question?
[1:30:10] <Tisaric> HMMMMM
[1:30:10] <%fatalDestiny> Hmmmm
[1:30:11] <teebos> hmmm
[1:30:11] <stoatacious> :)
[1:30:11] <%derpy_platypus> They wake up dead
[1:30:12] <%DrTomT18> They exist only as souls. I think. That's my theory
[1:30:12] <%Frost_Quill> Your light goes out.
[1:30:12] <+Delenay> some arent soaking
[1:30:14] <foxenco> HMMMMMMMM
[1:30:14] <harmless_toast> they don'ty go around jumping off balconies and rafts LUL
[1:30:16] <Edsta94> they protected their flame for that long?
[1:30:18] <Treasure_Vault> They believe harder
[1:30:19] <HiveMasterMind> light goes out from water
[1:30:20] <%Deadpal> oh yeah they totally are blowing it out faster
[1:30:21] <+tomdwarf> I think its if their flame goes out, they wake up. So when its flooded, they die too
[1:30:21] <%Frost_Quill> Your fire goes out, theirs didn't.
[1:30:22] <%Agami23> they are fast as fuck and strong as shit. which is hot
[1:30:23] <Louie_Salmon> It must be like, their souls fully enter that world
[1:30:23] <CatsDrunkonCopper> it's a mystery
[1:30:24] <%Deadpal> awww
[1:30:25] <CrematedCube> They keep very good care of their lights apparently
[1:30:25] <$ringabal> Okay, now they're just spawn camping
[1:30:27] <+twohitgood> they're better at it than you.
[1:30:30] <%Monkeyweed21> pat why
[1:30:33] <cheapdoc> They died waaay before the bullshit with the water
[1:30:33] <vVAstrAVv> pat focus your light to lure them from far away without making them aggressive
[1:30:35] <%sporeian94> Does Paige find the owl men sexy yes or no?
[1:30:36] <heartlesshealer> the dam only breaks now because erosion
[1:30:38] <mrapplebucks> 65
[1:30:39] <buhbuhboat> might be a water thing, never flooded before
[1:30:39] <scrumbotime> you try waking up dead
[1:30:42] <+Pequod1> why did it just take him into the zone
[1:30:44] <heartlesshealer> it's just been too long
[1:30:47] <Ben_Lunaris> Turn out that light  rbzEZ
[1:30:53] <%buerdo> It’s the flame going out that wakes you
[1:30:57] <Tisaric> you're waking up because of the light going out yeah
[1:31:02] <AoiRob> haha meditating puts you to sleep too
[1:31:02] <Riyokuno> yes
[1:31:03] <teebos> meditating next to the fire takes you to the dream
[1:31:04] <harmless_toast> well you do also wake up if you die in the dream world
[1:31:06] <+tomdwarf> yep
[1:31:07] <%Monkeyweed21> "Maybe if  I run at the the guard in the exact same way this time it will work"
[1:31:08] <%derpy_platypus> YEP
[1:31:08] <%VHGS> probably!
[1:31:08] <iosephe> maybe
[1:31:09] <+Pequod1> yeah probably
[1:31:09] <Tisaric> yes
[1:31:09] <%DrTomT18> yes
[1:31:09] <+TombstoneTTromboners> don't worry about it
[1:31:10] <PKLoveLucas> yup
[1:31:10] <+Slimperton> fun fact: whenever you hear screaming in the dream world, that's the sound of the light going out
[1:31:10] <Riyokuno> also yes
[1:31:10] <cheapdoc> Probably
[1:31:11] <%Valdorick> Yes!
[1:31:13] <Tisaric> I mean they were dead
[1:31:13] <Edsta94> correct
[1:31:14] <%tank7013> Probably
[1:31:14] <%Frost_Quill> Yes maybe.
[1:31:15] <%dekkitout> Here I thought you woke up because today's october 1st
[1:31:15] <Tisaric> but yesh
[1:31:15] <tanarath> Does it?
[1:31:16] <$dalmek> they wake up VERY uncomfortable
[1:31:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> seems like the implication yeah
[1:31:17] <ZE_Count> who knows
[1:31:19] <foxenco> Probably
[1:31:20] <leole11> yes
[1:31:21] <%Piemen99> Oh tottally
[1:31:23] <FleshFriend> yeah but you wouldnt do that to them would you :)
[1:31:24] <teebos> sucks for them
[1:31:24] <%DrTomT18> that's why you hear them scream when their rooms get flooded
[1:31:24] <+tomdwarf> at least the ones in the tower and the lower houses, yeah, all the owl people wake up and immediately die
[1:31:24] <buhbuhboat> you hear a big scream in the dream world whenever the flood happens
[1:31:26] <AoiRob> when the place gets wrecked yea
[1:31:27] <%Valdorick> Nothing will survive the end of the universe. *Nothing*.
[1:31:27] <vVAstrAVv> yes actually
[1:31:30] <cheapdoc> They are in a suicide machine tho
[1:31:30] <$ringabal> Soul VR hits different
[1:31:32] <leole11> what do you think the scream in the middle of the loop is?
[1:31:33] <+Delenay> i bet the thing they locked up is some kind of big fan to blow their dream candles out
[1:31:34] <%Monkeyweed21> they wake up dead
[1:31:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gief
[1:31:35] <heartlesshealer> wait are they the screams?
[1:31:38] <+Pequod1> @Slimperton makes for a good timer too: the second cry is when the tower falls over
[1:31:38] <%Faustgesicht> They wake up as Skeletons
[1:31:39] <%buerdo> Yes
[1:31:39] <CrematedCube> I believe that ghost whisper you hear is a room getting flooded
[1:31:43] <%DrTomT18> THE GIEF
[1:31:43] <%Deadpal> yeah you are.
[1:31:43] <ZE_Count> yep
[1:31:44] <%DrTomT18> yes you are
[1:31:48] <stoatacious> why can't we just splash a bicket of water on them?
[1:31:48] <RoughBoulder22> weird that they're still in it when they have no brain left
[1:31:48] <+extantCadence> You do also wake up if your lungs fill with water though, these people just never let that happen
[1:31:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ya but that's easy
[1:31:52] <foxenco> Yup
[1:31:53] <leole11> @heartlesshealer 100%
[1:31:55] <+Delenay> they are immortal even to the sun exploding so long as their dream flames are on
[1:31:57] <iosephe> Yeah, but you can wait to do it
[1:31:58] <Ben_Lunaris> You have to snuff out there light before they snuff yours out TPFufun
[1:32:00] <%Deadpal> BUT you can explore more ahead of time to find things and rememberr where things are?
[1:32:00] <%SovPho> You should do the gorge one first
[1:32:01] <%Piemen99> ye, new timeline new you
[1:32:02] <AoiRob> to get past the alarm yea
[1:32:03] <+tomdwarf> These owls could be like Micolash from Bloodborne "Please, I don't want to wake up!"
[1:32:10] <%RayReborne> Listening to Gief breath Kappa
[1:32:10] <%derpy_platypus> Sans voicelines
[1:32:13] <heartlesshealer> @heartlesshealer Damn, that really sucks for them >:
[1:32:22] <RyuuAoi> Is Peach doing anything spooky today?
[1:32:26] <iosephe> they're spoopy owls
[1:32:28] <tanarath> the baby is pleased
[1:32:31] <%derpy_platypus> Does Paige think they're hot?
[1:32:31] <IHaveNoFunnyName> As long as there is enough fuel to light the fire and electricity to run the simulation At some point entropy will take all
[1:32:32] <%jtdobyns> shes listening to "NO cock like horse cock"
[1:32:33] <%DrTomT18> If only they weren't so mean :(
[1:32:33] <ZE_Count> also are they dead dead?? because they're not skeletons they have skin its just their fur and feathers are gone.
[1:32:34] <%Deadpal> yes
[1:32:34] <Srthunda> booooo
[1:32:36] <%drabberfaun535> has paige seen the owl skeletons?
[1:32:37] <IzanagiNoOokami> The next time one grabs you you should blow really hard and damn them to Spirit death.  Tech their Command Grab.
[1:32:38] <%Deadpal> lol
[1:32:40] <Calek> I heard and I'm very proud of her
[1:32:40] <smoothwood07> the owls are not what they seem
[1:32:40] <%DrTomT18> Tell Piage she's fired
[1:32:41] <AoiRob> its wild out here
[1:32:43] <%DrTomT18> booo
[1:32:44] <%Valdorick> The Owls of Mensis
[1:32:44] <+Delenay> hueh hueh
[1:32:45] <%Deadpal> *WHO*
[1:32:49] <NeroInfinite> booo
[1:32:50] <%derpy_platypus> Next bit
[1:32:51] <heartlesshealer> Hoo
[1:33:01] <%RayReborne> if foxlady no on screen can't hear Kappa
[1:33:08] <%JoshManVGH> Whooourns
[1:33:09] <%DrTomT18> Their bodies are all dead, so they can't wake up
[1:33:09] <%Monkeyweed21> We were saying whooo-urns
[1:33:13] <Ben_Lunaris> @PatStaresAt Did you try speakng the sacred words "Hoo Hoo Hoo?"
[1:33:13] <Edsta94> spoilers
[1:33:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> man that sucks..
[1:33:22] <%DrTomT18> wake me up (can't wake up)
[1:33:22] <AoiRob> aw now it's sad
[1:33:26] <%Deadpal> yeah you could
[1:33:26] <%Agami23> why dont you just go up to each of the dead bodies and blow out their lights?
[1:33:35] <+extantCadence> It's interesting that they made this crazy dream vr world thing and they programmed it so the water still puts out your flame thing when the stuff is literally everywhere inside
[1:33:37] <%DrTomT18> it's an observation
[1:33:37] <%Deadpal> ....
[1:33:39] <%Deadpal> try that?
[1:33:40] <%VHGS> lungs too small
[1:33:40] <RyuuAoi> Chat always gotta spoil something.
[1:33:41] <%Deadpal> oh my god.
[1:33:41] <Edsta94> you're meant to figure it out yourself not get someone else @PatStaresAt
[1:33:42] <%DrTomT18> your character isn't a murderer?
[1:33:42] <+TombstoneTTromboners> because your PC is too nice
[1:33:43] <+punit216> that's fucked
[1:33:43] <thetntm> because murder is bad
[1:33:43] <%derpy_platypus> thats fucked ujp
[1:33:44] <leole11> i don't think that's a spoiler
[1:33:46] <%Dakuu75> why don't we jsut nuke it from orbit?
[1:33:46] <cheapdoc> Maybe your dude is not into MURDER
[1:33:46] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt do you think a hearthian could fistfight one of those owl dudes?
[1:33:48] <%Deadpal> CAN YOU?
[1:33:51] <RoughBoulder22> if you didn't realise it yourself yet then it's a spoiler isn't it?
[1:33:53] <%RayReborne> No Blow button Kappa
[1:33:54] <+JustToWatch> you have weak and pitiful lungs
[1:33:55] <%Valdorick> You're an explorer, not a genocider.
[1:33:56] <ZE_Count> Pat do me favor zoom in on their bodies
[1:33:56] <AoiRob> that would be murder and thus bad D:
[1:33:58] <$ringabal> Only marshmallows are worthy of being blown
[1:34:02] <%RayReborne> only jetpack
[1:34:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @extantCadence muh immersion
[1:34:04] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Because your character DOESNT JUST MURDER PEOPLE
[1:34:08] <%DrTomT18> @RoughBoulder22 A good question
[1:34:08] <%Deadpal> yeah!
[1:34:09] <$dalmek> oh no time ethics again
[1:34:09] <iosephe> The hatchling believes in time ethics
[1:34:09] <CatsDrunkonCopper> why don't you just commit genocide?
[1:34:10] <buhbuhboat> hearthians have weak lungs i guess
[1:34:12] <%tank7013> Time ethics do not exist
[1:34:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> Time ethics
[1:34:14] <+punit216> Still fucked
[1:34:16] <%Dakuu75> agreed
[1:34:18] <%JoshManVGH> Pat engaging in some light space genocide again.
[1:34:19] <+TombstoneTTromboners> your player character believes in time loops
[1:34:19] <%VHGS> KILLING IS BADONG
[1:34:19] <%Alazull> 12 minutes all over again
[1:34:20] <%Frost_Quill> Unless it's the LAST loop.
[1:34:21] <+Slimperton> yeah but what if that breaks the loop
[1:34:22] <%Agami23> time ethics dont exist
[1:34:22] <%Mr_Pylon> that;s what the Nomai thought
[1:34:23] <%DrTomT18> Remember 12 minutes
[1:34:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> 12 minutes all over again
[1:34:23] <+TombstoneTTromboners> *time ethics
[1:34:24] <%Deadpal> >they love it
[1:34:25] <%Deadpal> paige no
[1:34:26] <AoiRob> nah your character's too nice
[1:34:26] <ZE_Count> I mean ba dkarma
[1:34:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea we know we saw you play 12 minutes
[1:34:28] <$dalmek> your character, however, believes in time ethics
[1:34:28] <Edsta94> it's more like backseating not a spoiler
[1:34:29] <%DrTomT18> where you can just kill your wife over and over again
[1:34:29] <cheapdoc> Patric ...
[1:34:30] <%bassoontyphoon> Is it murder if they’re already dead?
[1:34:30] <foxenco> What if it's the last one tho
[1:34:30] <ne0bunny> a DEATHLOOP you might say
[1:34:31] <FleshFriend> Whats that one villain in Wakfu?
[1:34:31] <Calek> there's a movie that talked about this
[1:34:31] <$ringabal> This man killed his wife on the 3rd run
[1:34:31] <%dekkitout> Aiight man, no more time loop games for you
[1:34:32] <%sporeian94> what about kissing people on the lips?
[1:34:32] <thetntm> what if the timeline persists after you loop back
[1:34:32] <%Frost_Quill> What if that one is actually the last loop?
[1:34:33] <danraven> what if you hold the warp core in your hands while you do it
[1:34:36] <ZE_Count> God would be mad Pat!
[1:34:36] <aeonicVector> But what if that creates the 12 minutes baby
[1:34:37] <not_twitter_rowan> Pat if I get in a time loop the first thing I'm gonna do is kill you then
[1:34:37] <scrumbotime> Just make sure you're not in one of those "only one time" time loops
[1:34:37] <%walternatorz> it's like a permanent quick save in skyrim
[1:34:37] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL
[1:34:38] <thetntm> just not for you
[1:34:49] <%JoshManVGH> @ringabal LUL
[1:34:52] <Ben_Lunaris> But if the time loop breaks, you're a mass murderer FeelsBadMan
[1:34:53] <%derpy_platypus> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:34:55] <hellfirejefe> nomai blow up the sun mentality
[1:34:59] <not_twitter_rowan> @scrumbotime that's true
[1:35:00] <AoiRob> kill him, gief
[1:35:04] <ZE_Count> Hes learning
[1:35:04] <The_hidden_> zangief is loud lol
[1:35:05] <$realm_forge> As long as you know the conditions of the loop tho
[1:35:05] <leole11> @RoughBoulder22 i mean, pat realized that the flame going off = death, and he knows several fires go underwater at a certain point of the loop, it isn't a spoiler
[1:35:08] <%Frost_Quill> Idea: You're in a time loop for centuries, and when you finally escape everyone remembers what you did in those timelines.
[1:35:09] <AoiRob> strike for the vital orb
[1:35:11] <+TombstoneTTromboners> conceal, don't feel
[1:35:12] <cheapdoc> Wait, I didn't watch that stream, he killed his wife in ONLY the third run?
[1:35:12] <churropoppa> LIKE A MERRY GO ROUND
[1:35:22] <RyuuAoi> Kill for Mother, Gief
[1:35:27] <@GeneralSCPatton> Did you know about the Cleanish Hands cheevo in Deathloop? I totally called it. Kill only Visionaries on the final loop.
[1:35:33] <The_hidden_> the god hand
[1:35:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cheapdoc he did it many times after
[1:35:35] <2midgetsinacoat> @Frost_Quill essentially Westworld
[1:35:42] <RoughBoulder22> @leole11 but did he CONNECT the two? the puzzle is in connecting the information

[1:36:26] <%Frost_Quill> Is that the one watching t.v.?
[1:36:27] <leole11> @RoughBoulder22 you asked if it was a spoiler, and he knew both pieces of information, i wouldn't classify a logical deduction of that information to be a spoiler
[1:36:29] <%DrTomT18> like, punch them in the balls
[1:36:29] <%tank7013> I see I see
[1:36:32] <%Deadpal> good job pat

[1:36:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Frost_Quill no that
[1:36:46] <vVAstrAVv> is it jank when theyre actually ghosts
[1:36:48] <IHaveNoFunnyName> It's not a spoiler because there's more information pat doesn't have that you need
[1:36:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Frost_Quill sory no thats in another dream world

[1:37:19] <%DrTomT18> she be like 'yo I like your eyes'
[1:37:20] <%Deadpal> YEAH HE WAS RIGHT HTERE I KNEW IT.
[1:37:23] <teebos> LOL
[1:37:24] <RoughBoulder22> @RoughBoulder22 the entire game is logical deduction of information, like blowing out and lighting things with the lamp and those totems
[1:37:24] <%bassoontyphoon> Need to figure out how to slay that owlussy
[1:37:27] <cheapdoc> How come they don't emit light?
[1:37:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:37:31] <%Like51bears> pat try using the focus part of the light as well
[1:37:31] <%Deadpal> "I like your cut g"
[1:37:33] <buhbuhboat> if you focus your light you can bait them
[1:37:33] <mr_saturday93> @the_hidden_ sounds sexual
[1:37:36] <PKLoveLucas> pat for the love of god use the beam
[1:37:38] <%Deadpal> they're OWLS PAT.
[1:37:39] <%SovPho> They're owls, Pat
[1:37:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they don't need it
[1:37:42] <%derpy_platypus> that one guards the tunnel with his light off
[1:37:42] <scrumbotime> They're holding down the Conceal button
[1:37:43] <+TombstoneTTromboners> to sneak up on you
[1:37:44] <%Valdorick> Hide and Seek Owls
[1:37:45] <iosephe> they're assholes
[1:37:45] <%RayReborne> man this seems harder than it should
[1:37:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @cheapdoc they're owls they can see in the dark
[1:37:49] <2midgetsinacoat> they stalk in the dark and use the light to find you
[1:37:50] <%Frost_Quill> i guess they know you're there now that you did the thing so they're hiding
[1:37:50] <$ringabal> "Sir Hootle, he just keeps coming back! This is bullshit!"
[1:37:50] <%SveriSageAdvice> they're bird people, so i would assume they dont need it
[1:37:51] <harmless_toast> this is ADVANCED darkness, it absorbs light
[1:37:54] <foxenco> they run only when you're near
[1:37:54] <leole11> they are closing their lanterns
[1:37:56] <smoothwood07> they're owls
[1:37:56] <nomos42> I thought it was a bug but I think they are actually concealing
[1:37:56] <AoiRob> they're OWLS pat
[1:37:59] <%Deadpal> you are not, this shit's just hard.
[1:38:02] <Ben_Lunaris> Because they're made of darkness TPFufun
[1:38:02] <lilmac64> Are you supposed to be using the beam to spot them ahead of time?
[1:38:03] <harmless_toast> maybe one of the secrets in the other areas will teach you something that will make this easier?
[1:38:03] <vVAstrAVv> pat i say again. focusing your light will lure them without them immediately chasing you
[1:38:06] <Explodincatz> thats part of the Easy mode for some raisin
[1:38:06] <cheapdoc> @Monkeyweed21 But I could swear their lanterns are lit
[1:38:08] <%Piemen99> fucking spane owl elves
[1:38:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Owls have night vision
[1:38:09] <%RayReborne> maybe focus the light to see far ahead?
[1:38:10] <+tomdwarf> To hide, my guess. They still need light, as they whip out their spotlights when looking for you.
[1:38:10] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt You can trick them by flashing them and then conceiling.
[1:38:11] <%buerdo> Owls
[1:38:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> they literally have magic vision, it has nothing to do with owlness
[1:38:16] <%DrTomT18> yeah, you're getting caught
[1:38:17] <ZE_Count> thats why I changed to reduce frights
[1:38:18] <%Faustgesicht> Been able to talk to that one in the lower levels?
[1:38:18] <Explodincatz> no Pat its just bad
[1:38:19] <+TombstoneTTromboners> use the focus to lure them
[1:38:20] <nomos42> @harmless_toast i don't think so
[1:38:21] <thetntm> shine it at them early before you see them
[1:38:22] <%whyskeywolfe> Well you’re getting killed a lot. That’s incorrect.
[1:38:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> their eyes glow
[1:38:24] <%DrTomT18> psaSmug
[1:38:24] <buhbuhboat> focus the light to bait and then sneak behind is how you gotta do it, its just hard cause you can't see anything lol
[1:38:27] <%derpy_platypus> juked
[1:38:28] <The_hidden_> inch like that
[1:38:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @cheapdoc yea and they conceal that shit so it doesnt go out
[1:38:29] <%Deadpal> oh shit oh shit oh shit
[1:38:33] <%G_Thunders> Trick them with the light or just turn down the difficulty
[1:38:34] <teebos> nicenicenice
[1:38:34] <Ben_Lunaris> Space Owls are made of space of course rbzLul
[1:38:35] <cheapdoc> Ok, their lantern was not lit
[1:38:38] <%Deadpal> YOU DID IT
[1:38:43] <cheapdoc> @Monkeyweed21 My bad
[1:38:43] <Edsta94> pointing out logical deductions is more backseating rather than a spoiler but still bad imo
[1:38:45] <%Deadpal> 10/10 good job
[1:38:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok 1st part done
[1:38:46] <cheapdoc> I forgor
[1:38:46] <leole11> oh that's creepy af
[1:38:46] <harmless_toast> @harmless_toast well I was trying to be subtle, but yes there is...

[1:38:50] <AoiRob> nailed it
[1:38:50] <%DrTomT18> THERES A DUDE DOWN HERE

[1:38:52] <ZE_Count> now for the hard part

[1:38:56] <leole11> @Edsta94 fair, i'm sorry
[1:39:08] <IHaveNoFunnyName> I mean then you run into the forgotten city issue, "Can I ban someone for being a genius"
[1:39:10] <cheapdoc> NICE

[1:39:18] <2midgetsinacoat> dead end
[1:39:20] <%Deadpal> WHY IS THIS SO TERRIFYING.
[1:39:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> can you conceal and focus at the same time?
[1:39:29] <%Deadpal> it's hte music and the enemies.
[1:39:31] <+TombstoneTTromboners> they're coming for you pat
[1:39:33] <AoiRob> go back up
[1:39:34] <%Frost_Quill> he coming
[1:39:34] <cheapdoc> turn it off
[1:39:40] <+TombstoneTTromboners> "hey man"

[1:40:14] <RoughBoulder22> for instance @leole11 he just realised he could use the long range to make them move, explaining that before would be backseating/spoiling how to solve it, as he hadn't connected the long range and them responding to light

[1:40:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can now
[1:40:39] <+Pequod1> you can juke them
[1:40:40] <%Deadpal> you cannot outrun them in normal fright mode.
[1:40:41] <Calek> and you just talked about this happening in SOMA too
[1:40:41] <FleshFriend> BabyRage
[1:40:41] <%DrTomT18> yeah, it's annoying
[1:40:42] <%barrakuta371> story mode enabled

[1:40:44] <heartlesshealer> you showcased it and that's good enough
[1:40:44] <%derpy_platypus> outsmart them
[1:40:45] <$dalmek> you can NOW outrun them
[1:40:45] <%DrTomT18> weird design choice
[1:40:45] <teebos> no in this moed
[1:40:45] <%dasmause> people are VERY upset huh
[1:40:46] <nomos42> you can dodge sometimes but yeh nah
[1:40:49] <Riyokuno> this i can get
[1:40:49] <%Frost_Quill> break line of sight and run in the dark I guess
[1:40:49] <The_hidden_> u can juke them
[1:40:49] <2midgetsinacoat> Now they basically don't use their lanters
[1:40:49] <buhbuhboat> I've not seen this so interesting to see how much easier this makes things
[1:40:50] <tanarath> Real talk, it's fine
[1:40:50] <+BloodyBurney> tbh, this doesnt feel super fun, just brute forcing
[1:40:50] <foxenco> Jokes aside that's the correct choice for stream
[1:40:53] <%G_Thunders> Giving them a speed boost doesn’t actually add anything to the experience
[1:40:54] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Try bargaining with them
[1:40:56] <%RayReborne> i require my binkie
[1:40:56] <teebos> you can outrun them in reduced frights
[1:40:58] <harmless_toast> look how tall their chairs and tables are, their legs are as long as we are tall!
[1:40:59] <+redyoshi5> you can out run them thats what i did
[1:41:01] <%Monkeyweed21> BabyRage
[1:41:03] <leole11> @RoughBoulder22 i mean, i still think it isn't a spoiler, and my comment didn't explain how to solve anything, so i don't see your point
[1:41:08] <+upandadam> these guys weren't that fun for me either
[1:41:08] <yeanahnah> It increased my enjoyment so much not having to deal with their shit
[1:41:09] <$ringabal> Difficulty change? Time to start screaming coward
[1:41:11] <Edsta94> they essentially made stealth optional
[1:41:12] <aeonicVector> Just stick it to the Miles Morales Dad, ALL the excuse you need
[1:41:12] <%Deadpal> YEP.
[1:41:12] <danraven> this is probably the most frustrating part of the dlc to be honest
[1:41:15] <%JonathLP> Roses are red, zangief is aloof, you struggled with shadow owls, frights have been reduced.
[1:41:15] <smoothwood07> try using diplomacy
[1:41:16] <stoatacious> playing on easy mode is A-OK
[1:41:16] <%Deadpal> now just walk to the end.
[1:41:16] <harmless_toast> @PatStaresAt now you CAN outrun them because they don't run
[1:41:16] <+Pequod1> you flash them at a distance, make them lunge then you block the light and sprint past
[1:41:17] <vVAstrAVv> you can lure them from far away and go around. easily
[1:41:25] <%DrTomT18> they seem confused more than angry
[1:41:26] <%baka_sugoi> EZ BabyRage
[1:41:30] <%Frost_Quill> i can't believe Pat went into the game and crippled all their legs to make it easier.
[1:41:31] <CrematedCube> Spooky without the scary
[1:41:31] <%Deadpal> 100% ag-
[1:41:32] <%DrTomT18> in baby mode lmao
[1:41:32] <buhbuhboat> damn this is free
[1:41:33] <Ben_Lunaris> Kite em rbzLul
[1:41:33] <%Deadpal> GOD DAMMIT
[1:41:34] <vVAstrAVv> biiiiiitch
[1:41:36] <%drabberfaun535> all the people claiming you can out run them clearly played with this mode on
[1:41:36] <%Monkeyweed21> BIG BABY GET WING
[1:41:36] <stoatacious> honestly you can just gun it across now
[1:41:38] <%Valdorick> How to win: CHEAT
[1:41:40] <%derpy_platypus> Dick dropped
[1:41:42] <%RayReborne> psaDab psaDab
[1:41:42] <IHaveNoFunnyName> @danraven This whole part of the game was completely different to me because I did it with more information
[1:41:42] <cheapdoc> Goblins DEFEATED
[1:41:42] <Edsta94> i enjoyed the challenge of stealth in the dark, it was fun and spooky
[1:41:48] <%JonathLP> Roses are red, zangief is aloof, you struggled with shadow owls, frights have been reduced.
[1:41:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> zangief growling in disapproval
[1:41:49] <%tigerfang86> Streamer turned down difficulty? time to attack their character viciously because they dont conform to my standards
[1:41:49] <%bassoontyphoon> This is still pretty spooky tbh
[1:41:49] <AoiRob> they're drunk now
[1:41:51] <%Frost_Quill> Geif mad that you cheated.
[1:41:51] <foxenco> BUT YOUR PENIS THO
[1:41:53] <vVAstrAVv> and balls
[1:41:54] <%baka_sugoi> PP FALL
[1:41:54] <+Delenay> gief is recharged
[1:41:55] <%Monkeyweed21> all you had to do was use the baby mode for children
[1:41:55] <%shurtal> gief does not like your choice
[1:41:56] <RyuuAoi> psaBig BabyRage
[1:41:56] <Fien111> Gief is upset
[1:41:57] <The_hidden_> zangief owl
[1:41:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> a middle ground between these two options would've been nice
[1:41:59] <thetntm> zangeif is making the spooky noises for us now]
[1:42:00] <+Delenay> he is ready
[1:42:01] <%JoshManVGH> These games have no real enemies for a reason.
[1:42:01] <Riyokuno> DogChamp
[1:42:05] <%YakumoYomi> But now your penis will float away...!
[1:42:12] <%bassoontyphoon> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:42:13] <%Dakuu75> Gief is making monster noises and it's freaking me out, yo~
[1:42:13] <%baka_sugoi> psaDogchamp
[1:42:16] <%dasmause> @Monkeyweed21 why are you so upset
[1:42:19] <The_hidden_> the owls aren't what they seem
[1:42:19] <stoatacious> just run
[1:42:21] <%Valdorick> He's got you, pat
[1:42:22] <%Deadpal> zangief jesus christ
[1:42:23] <+TombstoneTTromboners> pat it sees you
[1:42:23] <buhbuhboat> i totally get turning on this mode, shit is hard especially for a game with no techincal difficulty before
[1:42:27] <$Mothman742> @patstaresat is it true you're 6'4?
[1:42:28] <leole11> jump the fence
[1:42:29] <RoughBoulder22> he's about got it
[1:42:33] <$realm_forge> Zangeif is providing stellar horror ambience
[1:42:34] <%Frost_Quill> Man Geif is really mad you turned that down Pat.
[1:42:36] <cheapdoc> can't you jump over the rails?
[1:42:37] <%Monkeyweed21> @dasmause lol
[1:42:39] <vVAstrAVv> how about jumping over the rails
[1:42:42] <%DrTomT18> lmao I thought the sounds Gief was making were the Owls
[1:42:44] <RyuuAoi> Gief sound like Cujo. I love it!
[1:42:45] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Zangief is so pissed
[1:42:50] <teebos> YEYEYE
[1:42:50] <danraven> @danraven yeah so did I, still took a while with a few attempts
[1:42:52] <%derpy_platypus> If you fail with baby mode, are you lesser than a baby?
[1:42:53] <Ben_Lunaris> Too many Space Owls on this planet WutFace
[1:42:58] <vVAstrAVv> ARE YOU GONNA GET CAUGHT IN BABY MODE PAT
[1:42:58] <%bassoontyphoon> Zangief hates it

[1:45:48] <RoughBoulder22> the signal disappeared
[1:45:49] <The_hidden_> it's a contact lens
[1:45:50] <%tank7013> They wanted to shield the universe from the eye?
[1:45:50] <%Frost_Quill> They were so mad they silenced their god.
[1:45:52] <bippityjones> Now nobody will have to worry about that thing again haha we're such good guys
[1:45:52] <Calek> @PatStaresAt remember when the Nomai were confused why the eye stopped emitting a signal

[1:48:25] <yeanahnah> Yep got everything
[1:48:28] <%Deadpal> you found everything here.
[1:48:28] <2midgetsinacoat> did you understand the reels?
[1:48:28] <home2_u> The device is a signal jammer.
[1:48:29] <bippityjones> two secrets remaining
[1:48:29] <stoatacious> that's everything here
[1:48:33] <leole11> yes, you're done
[1:48:33] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt you did it you found the things
[1:48:33] <foxenco> done here
[1:48:34] <FleshFriend> hmm
[1:48:34] <bippityjones> then the BIG secret
[1:48:36] <nomos42> no code, only knowledge posting5head
[1:48:37] <RiverBirch> You have seen everything you needed to see
[1:48:37] <ZE_Count> two more places baby
[1:48:39] <%Frost_Quill> maybe thhere's something under the elevator?
[1:48:40] <RoughBoulder22> no codes for you LUL, where to next
[1:48:40] <vVAstrAVv> thats everything
[1:48:42] <%JonathLP> send elevator up
[1:48:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> got some good info tho
[1:48:49] <%Deadpal> you learned about some things~!
[1:48:49] <Riyokuno> to the next one
[1:48:50] <ZE_Count> the owldeer luv them codes
[1:48:53] <Edsta94> the first one means they blocked the eyes signal, the eye was not their ship @PatStaresAt
[1:48:55] <smoothwood07> you followed the secret stairway
[1:49:04] <%JonathLP> Has pat unlocked the coffin yet?
[1:49:06] <%Deadpal> misunbdlkjusrterood
[1:49:07] <ZE_Count> check your log
[1:49:11] <Ben_Lunaris> Knowledge of how to save/screw the universe rbzEZ
[1:49:13] <%DrTomT18> so they are the ones that fucked the Nomai over!
[1:49:17] <%Frost_Quill> Ship log.
[1:49:20] <Edsta94> xxxCHEERS
[1:49:20] <%DrTomT18> those bastards!
[1:49:21] <vVAstrAVv> that stealth section is the hardest one btw pat
[1:49:21] <leole11> dw, it's complicated
[1:49:22] <%Deadpal> kinda!
[1:49:22] <cheapdoc> The nom eye
[1:49:23] <+redyoshi5> ya remember the nomi died cause they lost the signal mid jump
[1:49:28] <%Deadpal> they kinda fucked the universe over!
[1:49:30] <2midgetsinacoat> Pranked the Nomai lol
[1:49:34] <%Monkeyweed21> that wasnt a bit?
[1:49:35] <IHaveNoFunnyName> It's super cool because it explains that part of the base game
[1:49:35] <%Frost_Quill> Oh can we survive the end of the universe by somehow staying in the simulation?
[1:49:36] <AoiRob> its why the nomai couldnt find the signal again!
[1:49:38] <mr_saturday93> if they blocked the signal then how did thr nomai discover it?
[1:49:42] <%Deadpal> wait what
[1:49:48] <vVAstrAVv> owl ppl biggest heels ever
[1:49:48] <thetntm> that's just for the cove not the archive
[1:49:50] <CrematedCube> The lack of text makes things ambiguous, the logs help clear it up
[1:49:50] <leole11> don't worry about that
[1:49:54] <Ben_Lunaris> We get signal
[1:49:56] <nomos42> the other end of the raft
[1:49:56] <thetntm> I don't think it's important
[1:49:58] <harmless_toast> more in the cove, not in the reel archive room
[1:49:59] <The_hidden_> @mr_saturday93 excellent question
[1:49:59] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @mr_saturday93 :)
[1:50:00] <+dj_mixd> Might be worth turning on frights for the woodlands puzzle
[1:50:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mr_saturday93 :)
[1:50:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you never explored where that raft goes
[1:50:03] <%Like51bears> he never went to the end of the raft in the second area
[1:50:07] <danraven> haven't reached the other end with the raft
[1:50:09] <AoiRob> ah you missed the telescope from the reel
[1:50:11] <RoughBoulder22> @Deadpal did they? we found the eye and started the next one, as this one was already at its death
[1:50:13] <IHaveNoFunnyName> I don't think you ever took that raft to the other end, always got off part way with the hand
[1:50:14] <nomos42> it's not important except for goblinss
[1:50:20] <vVAstrAVv> its nothing important you just need to ride the boat all the way
[1:50:21] <leole11> it's fine, it's not essential
[1:50:24] <buhbuhboat> its whats at the end of the raft it doesn't matter tho
[1:50:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's a nice raft
[1:50:36] <stoatacious> you got the important stuff
[1:50:37] <AoiRob> you got the important thing tho
[1:50:48] <Saltmeisterr> but mind gobbo
[1:50:51] <Treasure_Vault> I love how they slotted in this place. "It was there the whole time, but invisible haha"
[1:50:55] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @Deadpal no they blocked the eye's signal preventing that from happening
[1:50:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it is not
[1:50:57] <%Valdorick> It really adds nothing
[1:51:01] <stoatacious> it's ok to be too scared by the game
[1:51:02] <Tisaric> yeah it's my one big complaint with the DLC
[1:51:03] <Ben_Lunaris> Back to the raft to kick those mind goblins in the balls rbzLul
[1:51:03] <teebos> not at all honestly
[1:51:09] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i thought it was a blast
[1:51:13] <PKLoveLucas> I had fun w them
[1:51:17] <Edsta94> @Deadpal they were the reason the nomai couldn't find the eye's signal and led to them making the time loop
[1:51:20] <vVAstrAVv> again pat you did the HARDEST part
[1:51:21] <%Mr_Pylon> it's the season of baby mode at Patstaresat
[1:51:22] <IHaveNoFunnyName> I never had to
[1:51:22] <leole11> damn, i didn't mind the non baby mode
[1:51:23] <nomos42> it's not as bad in the other section imo
[1:51:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's not even about the scariness jsut the annoyance of being completely blind
[1:51:28] <+SmartAssPawn089> It's not the same game to me, completely different.
[1:51:28] <vVAstrAVv> first
[1:51:31] <+TombstoneTTromboners> dread next week
[1:51:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i'm hype
[1:51:35] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib MON HUN RISE
[1:51:35] <@Ranryu692> does it?
[1:51:37] <aeonicVector> Dread
[1:51:38] <+SmartAssPawn089> Eh maybe not completely, but quite
[1:51:41] <%Valdorick> Like DREAD
[1:51:44] <%DrTomT18> you can always stream dead space!
[1:51:44] <buhbuhboat> I think its fine to do it but knowing that I was picking easy mode made me unable to abandon my gamer penis
[1:51:44] <%Mr_Pylon> YEAH
[1:51:45] <ergulor> oh yeah
[1:51:45] <%Valdorick> ... nextmonth
[1:51:45] <stoatacious> no
[1:51:46] <%FacetiousAF> i did not
[1:51:46] <mr_saturday93> nope
[1:51:47] <ergulor> looks dope
[1:51:47] <Saltmeisterr> metroid dread tho
[1:51:48] <tanarath> spooktober
[1:51:48] <%Agami23> it is?!
[1:51:50] <RyuuAoi> Pat gonna spook us up!
[1:51:51] <%Deft_Thought> I'm surprised there's been no word of any RE8 DLC
[1:51:51] <%Deadpal> James bond
[1:51:53] <pajamerslammer> Sad Dying Light got delayed to Feburary
[1:51:53] <%Deadpal> Dune 2021
[1:51:53] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt are you gonna play metroid dread?
[1:51:53] <Saltmeisterr> YEAH
[1:51:54] <%twoto858> Inscryption looks amazing
[1:51:54] <%sporeian94> hotwheel game came out that's scary
[1:51:55] <+dj_mixd> I'm glad they gave us an option. I like experiencing that they're a more aggressive race than Hearthians and Nomai.
[1:51:56] <+extantCadence> There's an easy way to get through the big room without them ever noticing you, it's the guy right in front of the first bell that gave me more trouble
[1:51:56] <%polothegreatest> dont forget the metroids
[1:52:00] <%Frost_Quill> Oh that one, yeah it looks cool.
[1:52:02] <stoatacious> dead space 3 stream?
[1:52:04] <aeonicVector> So my usual friday night?
[1:52:05] <ergulor> from the pony isalnd creator
[1:52:08] <@Ranryu692> sounds like a New Blood game
[1:52:11] <hellfirejefe> the owls wouldn't be so bad if weren't for the fact that you're on a constant timer
[1:52:11] <pajamerslammer> Back 4 Blood will probably be worth a gamepass try
[1:52:14] <RyuuAoi> JAMES BIND HYPE. HALLOWEEN KILLS HYPE.
[1:52:20] <+TombstoneTTromboners> play fusion
[1:52:22] <%FacetiousAF> one off Kappa
[1:52:23] <+Mondeiya> feel like they could have just had the green light always appear on the owls and it'd be fine
[1:52:28] <Treasure_Vault> It would be cool if Satan was your DM, but this was his hobby and he didn't bring work into it
[1:52:30] <%FacetiousAF> fusion is real good
[1:52:32] <+upandadam> HUH???
[1:52:36] <+TombstoneTTromboners> fusion is the direct predecessor of dread
[1:52:36] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt the gba remake of the first game is very good
[1:52:38] <Louie_Salmon> AM2R is cool and free
[1:52:39] <%Frost_Quill> I loved Left4Dead, I really hope Back 4 Blood doesn't suck.
[1:52:39] <%king_wragles> IMO, just do Fusion and you'll be set
[1:52:39] <JetpackMcQuack> they're fine
[1:52:47] <EternalJedi> @PatStaresAt Zero Mission and Fusion aren't super long, couyld do both before Dread
[1:52:50] <Afterman_> play fusion. fusion is the GOAT metroid
[1:52:51] <RyuuAoi> It's the 5th in the series, Pat.
[1:52:52] <harmless_toast> Metroid Fusion might be a good start. It seems to have a lot in common with Dread
[1:52:52] <Ben_Lunaris> Satan always get aces FailFish
[1:52:55] <IHaveNoFunnyName> @hellfirejefe The timer is like 20 minutes long
[1:52:56] <cosmicdischarge> will you play any silent hills games @PatStaresAt
[1:52:56] <$realm_forge> Any plans on streaming the Metroid prime series?
[1:52:58] <%sporeian94> Here's a question, can you play any of them right now without emulation on the switch
[1:52:58] <+extantCadence> I never did play all of Fusion
[1:53:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Samus Returns would tell you if you like Dread
[1:53:02] <%cvp5127> im playing other m right now
[1:53:03] <%Deadpal> Fusion and Zero are way better
[1:53:04] <+Delenay> meh, ive only romd super and i didnt care for it but remake on 3ds is great and makes me hype for this
[1:53:06] <bippityjones> Fusion's pretty darn good
[1:53:08] <Fien111> Yup
[1:53:09] <RyuuAoi> Pat, Fusion is amazing!
[1:53:09] <Treasure_Vault> Zero Mission and Fusion are the two best 2d ones, probably
[1:53:09] <JetpackMcQuack> shadow complex is my favorite 2d metroid
[1:53:12] <+redyoshi5> hey INSCRYPTION is made by the guy who made HEX so it will probably be really good
[1:53:15] <captain_kirkhammer> You're wrong, 2D Metroid gamefeel sucks
[1:53:16] <%Frost_Quill> My first Metroid game was the 3d gamecube one.
[1:53:17] <%polothegreatest> never play super but gbas
[1:53:18] <%Alazull> THE BABY
[1:53:19] <EternalJedi> Other M's not a good indicator
[1:53:19] <harmless_toast> no one liked other M
[1:53:20] <%Agami23> i think the changes that samus returns made that are in dread will be good for you.
[1:53:20] <lilmac64> Other M doesn't count,!
[1:53:21] <+JustToWatch> the best metriod is hollow knight
[1:53:21] <%Deadpal> wait
[1:53:22] <+tomdwarf> Other M is bad, but thats not fair to the rest.
[1:53:23] <buhbuhboat> dababy
[1:53:24] <+TombstoneTTromboners> I prefer Zero and Fusion to Super
[1:53:25] <@Ranryu692> play Zero Mission with save states
[1:53:25] <%Maids4lyfe> other M is ass
[1:53:27] <+Them00n> You like the Prime series tho? @PatStaresAt
[1:53:28] <%Deadpal> isn't inscryption by the guy who made pony island?
[1:53:28] <%Monkeyweed21> NO ONE LIKED OTHER M
[1:53:29] <+BloodyBurney> im partial to fusion
[1:53:32] <AoiRob> no one likes other m
[1:53:35] <foxenco> Inscryption is also from the guy who did pony island
[1:53:36] <%polothegreatest> we dont talk about other m LUL
[1:53:36] <Nifran> @Mondeiya what if there were other ways than dodging the owls?
[1:53:36] <%strakillias> Then why bother with dread?
[1:53:38] <+extantCadence> Axiom Verge is the shit. There's a sequel too and it's also pretty good.
[1:53:41] <captain_kirkhammer> That's totally fair, movement sucks in those two games
[1:53:43] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Super's good but it definitely feels like it gets carried as "best game ever" by nostalgia
[1:53:44] <Ben_Lunaris> Play Psychonauts, throw a curveball in there rbzEZ
[1:53:45] <%Deadpal> uhhh
[1:53:46] <dragonheart45> other m had good combat and that's really it
[1:53:46] <%RealThiele> Axiom verge was ok but it def had problems
[1:53:48] <RyuuAoi> I remember playing Fusion on a gameboy mini during work breaks. BEST
[1:53:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Alien-esque
[1:53:49] <%baka_sugoi> DA BABY BabyRage
[1:53:50] <%Deadpal> Fusion and zero mission have story
[1:53:50] <2midgetsinacoat> what are you doing?
[1:53:54] <+upandadam> is there a metroid story?
[1:53:58] <RyuuAoi> AND you like Space, Pat!
[1:54:00] <%Deadpal> Fusion and Zero Mission have a lot more story than the others do.
[1:54:04] <Afterman_> i think pat would like fusion
[1:54:06] <%Piemen99> So this what I got so far again the game, So owl people live for a long time and they make/find this magic fire which allows them to go into dream to live forever once they die, but since the EoU is putting out the "end of the universe"  signal they'll have to face death which they HATE so they're trying to stop the signal from ending the universe.
[1:54:06] <bippityjones> Fusion was my first metroid as a babby and I loved it
[1:54:07] <%DrTomT18> I mean, does Metroid have some outstanding story?
[1:54:08] <%tank7013> Zero mission is a remake of 1
[1:54:10] <harmless_toast> there isn't really any overarching story between games
[1:54:11] <+Them00n> Play zero mission then.
[1:54:11] <+tomdwarf> Id say if you didnt like Axiom Verge, then youll probably not like the others. You could try Fusion, Zero Mission, or Metroid 2 Remakle.
[1:54:11] <cheapdoc> Captain metroid
[1:54:11] <%Deadpal> Fusion has the *most* story outside of prime and Other M
[1:54:11] <krackman245> Some games never click with certain people
[1:54:12] <%valriot> Fusion is relevant to Dread at least, like Prime 1 to 3
[1:54:13] <%RealThiele> fusion takes place after super which you palyed
[1:54:17] <Explodincatz> Pat ther is no overarcing story
[1:54:18] <%jtdobyns> Xbox Original Fusion Frenzy?
[1:54:18] <Louie_Salmon> Oh what the fuck ever, they're all functionally separate
[1:54:19] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt play zero mission
[1:54:22] <+Pequod1> pat I think you're just repeating a cycle here
[1:54:23] <RyuuAoi> Fusion has all the classic shit, Pat
[1:54:24] <%Deadpal> @DrTomT18 yeah, it's not super great
[1:54:24] <+extantCadence> Also the Prime games have quite a bit of story
[1:54:25] <+Delenay> does anyone hate them
[1:54:26] <tanarath> You HATE the classic shit, play fusion
[1:54:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i wonder
[1:54:29] <%Deadpal> it's pretty generic
[1:54:31] <Treasure_Vault> Zero Mission is the one to start with if you're goingback.
[1:54:32] <+extantCadence> Though that's 3D
[1:54:34] <$ringabal> @PatStaresAt You could always just watch a walkthrough to catch up quick
[1:54:37] <%Monkeyweed21> DREAM CHURCH
[1:54:45] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yep
[1:54:46] <nomos42> yeh
[1:54:52] <harmless_toast> yup
[1:54:57] <$realm_forge> @patstaresat any plans to stream any of the prime series?
[1:54:57] <foxenco> that's it
[1:54:57] <+TombstoneTTromboners> jump in the lake
[1:54:58] <aeonicVector> Lmao Gief a better jumpscare then the owls
[1:54:59] <+tomdwarf> Play around with the telescope?
[1:55:00] <CrematedCube> Ayup, just ambiance
[1:55:00] <leole11> yes
[1:55:01] <%Like51bears> yes. im suprised it even marked it on the log
[1:55:01] <Louie_Salmon> Metroid games have as much shared canon as zelda games, which is to say basically zero other than link and zelda and ganon
[1:55:02] <%Valdorick> Yeah, its just there as point of reference for the hand
[1:55:04] <Nifran> monkaS scary dog
[1:55:06] <%Frost_Quill> Did the ship log not update?
[1:55:06] <harmless_toast> it's just a red herring to make it harder to find the handy boi by accident
[1:55:07] <vVAstrAVv> we told you it wasn't important
[1:55:08] <loukemia83> if you don't like zero mission, you probably just don't like 2d metroids
[1:55:08] <IHaveNoFunnyName> This is meant to be a hint for that secret reel. You're meant to see this in it and go "aha I know where that is!"
[1:55:12] <AngryAsian5> BORK
[1:55:13] <AoiRob> yea thats all
[1:55:14] <%RealThiele> dream bork
[1:55:23] <+extantCadence> Honestly I thought there'd be something with that telescope but yeah it's just the burned building and nothing in it
[1:55:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> where next
[1:55:32] <%notsoy> time to heat action the dog Kappa
[1:55:34] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat Regarding Kirby. You gotta break out that DS and play Squeak Squad and Mass Attack.
[1:55:35] <%nipplestheenchilada96> psaDogchamp
[1:55:36] <+Delenay> i dont like the controls of the 2ds, until they had 3ds/newage controls
[1:55:40] <%Piemen99> Shitass gief
[1:55:40] <%Frost_Quill> fire or bridge
[1:55:42] <AoiRob> nailed it
[1:55:45] <Treasure_Vault> If you play Zero Mission and hate it, you're fine to play nothing more
[1:55:49] <IHaveNoFunnyName> You're too smol to use the telescopt. Made for owls not fish
[1:55:50] <%Agami23> metroid zero mission is a remake of the first one. seems like a good place to start metroid
[1:55:51] <%G_Thunders> I think the idea was there were secret Eye worshippers even in the dream world
[1:55:52] <Ben_Lunaris> Zangeif mad
[1:55:55] <%Deadpal> da cliffs?
[1:56:03] <%Deadpal> oh.
[1:56:03] <+Delenay> yeah
[1:56:04] <harmless_toast> the endless canyon (as the log calls it)
[1:56:09] <%Deadpal> you might not like fusion and zero mission then.
[1:56:10] <%king_wragles> Oh
[1:56:11] <aeonicVector> Jumping and shooting shouldnt, but aiming can be ehh
[1:56:13] <%king_wragles> Maybe skip Dread
[1:56:16] <%Deadpal> if you hate the actual gameplay.
[1:56:17] <%DrTomT18> The most important part of Metroid is Samus' abs.
[1:56:21] <%Deadpal> yeah.
[1:56:23] <%Deadpal> maybe skip dread.
[1:56:24] <RyuuAoi> Fusion corrects ALL OF THAT, Pat.
[1:56:24] <pajamerslammer> My man issue with super metroid is metroid can't crawl
[1:56:25] <+twohitgood> the movement in super metroid is really stiff.
[1:56:25] <Explodincatz> theres a hack to fix that
[1:56:26] <%VHGS> it ain't contra
[1:56:28] <+Delenay> 3ds remake makes that stuff so easy and smooth
[1:56:30] <vVAstrAVv> pat where are u going
[1:56:31] <JetpackMcQuack> then try it on a game boy
[1:56:31] <%Monkeyweed21> pat where aare you going
[1:56:35] <%Deadpal> lol
[1:56:36] <+Delenay> and dreads by the same guys
[1:56:37] <%Deadpal> rip
[1:56:39] <The_hidden_> shouldn't Zangeif be tired after walking
[1:56:42] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt there's romhacks for changing Super's controls like SM:Redux
[1:56:43] <%Agami23> yeah samus returns gave free aim shooting i think, so dread should have it.
[1:56:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh yeah
[1:56:44] <$dalmek> just a bit of commentary fiugue
[1:56:50] <+Delenay> gief is awake
[1:56:52] <thetntm> I genuinely think those games are meant to feel like shit at the start so they become better by the end
[1:56:53] <%whyskeywolfe> yarf
[1:56:53] <%Piemen99> So much time wasted
[1:56:53] <Saltmeisterr> Nah dread movement looks smoove
[1:56:54] <+Delenay> he has recharged
[1:56:57] <%DrTomT18> I tried Axium Verge also becuase my friend said 'if you liked Hollow Knight you will like this' and I did not like it
[1:56:59] <EternalJedi> pajamerslammer she crawls in Zero Mission in one section, but otherwise, you try crawling in a full suit of power armor
[1:57:00] <%jtdobyns> bork
[1:57:01] <vVAstrAVv> meditate! lol
[1:57:01] <%polothegreatest> its the chozo genes
[1:57:02] <RyuuAoi> Told y'all Gief was gonna get hype
[1:57:09] <%bassoontyphoon> Bork bork
[1:57:09] <NeroInfinite> He's yapping at the gremlins
[1:57:12] <+extantCadence> @G_Thunders I think the idea is that they hate the Eye so much that they made a burned out church inside the VR to never forget the rage
[1:57:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> dont forget people, the vets were confused why he has so much energy and is so super healthy
[1:57:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> Zangief is an anomoly
[1:57:28] <%jtdobyns> will there ever be astral chain Dlc? or sequal?
[1:57:29] <harmless_toast> if you step back you can have two light-motors going at once
[1:57:31] <%sporeian94> Pat are you feeding him taco bell again?

[1:58:38] <RyuuAoi> Pat, do you have a backyard?
[1:58:45] <foxenco> @lag2993 He's getting the secrets from the dreams
[1:58:49] <%Deadpal> it's okay not to like soemthing everyone else loves pat
[1:58:53] <%Deadpal> as much as it sucks.
[1:58:57] <%Frost_Quill> @lag2993 If you mean the shadow world he's looking for the secret areas of that now.
[1:59:06] <%Deadpal> in those cases I watch other people play and buy the game anyways.
[1:59:08] <%Deadpal> Like persona.
[1:59:09] <%RetroCop87> I can't get into classic vania games at all
[1:59:11] <+lag2993> okay he's still got a bit then
[1:59:15] <%Maids4lyfe> so are these owl aliens the origin of ghost matter?
[1:59:16] <Tisaric> @Deadpal make sure you're doing it after the dam breaks, I got it on my second loop around starting right behind the dam as it broke
[1:59:16] <harmless_toast> @Deadpal just gotta keep practicing, and try to orient the raft so you can use two light-motors at once straight downstream as much as possible
[1:59:27] <$realm_forge> Metroid Prime Echos was the shit
[1:59:55] <%Deadpal> god give us metroid on the new agmes.
[1:59:55] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:59:57] <+Delenay> right
[1:59:57] <%Piemen99> So when can we learn this space owl elf language? Do we ever? DM me the answer so pat wont get spoiled
[1:59:59] <tanarath> Echoes was great
[2:00:02] <leole11> this one without baby mode suuuuuuucks
[2:00:02] <%Deadpal> *metroid prime on switch please*

[2:00:08] <%valriot> Baby hands

[2:00:12] <%Monkeyweed21> HONK
[2:00:14] <Treasure_Vault> Did they?
[2:00:14] <%Deadpal> tom nope!
[2:00:17] <%RetroCop87> Didn't they make a version of Prime that worked with a VR headset?
[2:00:20] <Explodincatz> wii sucked
[2:00:21] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah
[2:00:21] <+tomdwarf> Light Shit is AMAZING. Favorite suit in the series
[2:00:21] <%Deadpal> that's a huge group of people who hated that shit.
[2:00:23] <RyuuAoi> Did you play Hunters on the DS?
[2:00:32] <JetpackMcQuack> just like samus
[2:00:33] <%tank7013> How? Was it a size issue?
[2:00:35] <Louie_Salmon> @maids4lyfe I think some crazy alien just died and froze up to become the interloper, and their dank ass death gas was bad enough to kill everything in the solar system
[2:00:36] <+Delenay> not here
[2:00:37] <wibbwobbler> I think both prime and 2d are great, plenty of better stuff has come out since for sure
[2:00:40] <%RealThiele> Dolphin that heet
[2:00:44] <CrematedCube> It was the best application of Wii-waggle, but it was still a waggle
[2:00:48] <%dekkitout> It's usually here where I ask, "How were you holding it?"
[2:00:53] <+Delenay> oooofff
[2:00:53] <%MelBrooksKA> MelBrooksKA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! Hey Pat, allergies seem to be hitting and giving me the bad sleep

[2:11:45] <ZE_Count> knowledge gained
[2:11:47] <leole11> imagine giving wireframe mode  A LORE EXPLANATION
[2:11:47] <foxenco> YOU COULD HAVE DONE THIS ALL ALONG
[2:11:50] <teebos> trolled x2
[2:11:50] <%Frost_Quill> So the lantern is like where the graphics are rendering, but you can still see the collision???
[2:11:52] <%DrTomT18> THIS GAME IS FUCKING GREAT
[2:11:52] <%sporeian94> pat go back into the real world and check now that it's open!
[2:11:52] <+blaze__drag> once again reminder just like the original game, you could have done this at any time
[2:11:54] <%RayReborne> OK THIS SHIT IS RAD
[2:11:56] <IHaveNoFunnyName> @Valdorick That's what I did! You can use this to get around literally every stealth secion it's amazing
[2:11:57] <+Lightning_Goat> They really, really, REALLY didn't want anyone to get into that vault ever
[2:11:59] <+redyoshi5> look at this room with the lantern
[2:12:00] <Nifran> this insight would have been useful for avoiding the owls LUL
[2:12:02] <Kamayanna> I love how they went to all the effort bringing it down and then were like "...know what? Nah, screw this"
[2:12:03] <bippityjones> Now there are no dark areas in this mode
[2:12:03] <nomos42> where we're going, we don't need codes
[2:12:04] <+blaze__drag> if you ever thought to just put down the thing
[2:12:05] <%Tearonex> Peaking behind the curtain now
[2:12:07] <%tank7013> When I said they were scanning the reels in I didn't mean literally goddamn

[2:12:24] <%sporeian94> there's gotta be some sort of restoration secret them
[2:12:25] <harmless_toast> they REALLY don't want anyone figuring out those codes
[2:12:29] <Riyokuno> last secret
[2:12:30] <%DrTomT18> @2midgetsinacoat That made me laugh harder than it should have
[2:12:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sooo....

[2:12:32] <CrematedCube> The fog is actual to hide the rendering, wow
[2:12:32] <%JonathLP> water is coming
[2:12:36] <MyNameIsRasus> you need the lantern for archive rooms
[2:12:38] <+Delenay> thats amazing. you could have stumbled on that at anytime but never thought to drop it
[2:12:40] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt Creepy Porpoise just started playing some Out Wilds too, it seems.

[2:14:34] <Kamayanna> Can scout things out but can't do tech
[2:14:34] <bippityjones> @Pequod1 That's what I said!!
[2:14:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> time's up
[2:14:38] <%derpy_platypus> time up
[2:14:38] <%Deadpal> YOU LEARNED SO MUCH.
[2:14:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh that was the guys in the tower dying
[2:14:39] <Louie_Salmon> I love how this doubles as a visibility upgrade. This is a metroid power up that you gained by viewing an image
[2:14:40] <+extantCadence> That bridge is the best, such a nice time-saver
[2:14:42] <nomos42> cool shit huh
[2:14:43] <cheapdoc> TRIP
[2:14:44] <%Deadpal> good loop.
[2:14:45] <%JonathLP> Pat's mind is melting
[2:14:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you dont need the lantern to see, you need it to access the archives and elevators
[2:14:47] <%DrTomT18> on a scale of 1 to 10 how blown is your mind?
[2:14:48] <+Pequod1> Is that the music
[2:14:48] <+upandadam> did not expect this view from this game
[2:14:49] <ZE_Count> that would of made things easier
[2:14:51] <tanarath> hurt brain
[2:14:53] <%RayReborne> this is a mindfuck and im here for it
[2:14:55] <+Delenay> mind blown
[2:14:56] <%Deadpal> mind blown.
[2:14:57] <+tomdwarf> Remember too, that these bridges exist in regular dreamscape, their just hidden in the "backdoor code".
[2:14:58] <%Like51bears> 1 more pat
[2:14:59] <leole11> gud gam
[2:14:59] <ZE_Count> you see the cod enow NEO
[2:15:02] <MyNameIsRasus> that is the music
[2:15:05] <%Piemen99> DONT LET IT SET IN
[2:15:06] <%Valdorick> What shall secret zone 3 teach us?
[2:15:06] <+tomdwarf> Essentially, the bridges arent loaded with textures
[2:15:07] <+Pequod1> Can you hear the music cause you put the lantern down?
[2:15:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA
[2:15:14] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it rules
[2:15:15] <cheapdoc> Best game, yes, ever
[2:15:16] <Treasure_Vault> if you die in the game, you die in real life in the game
[2:15:16] <Edsta94> HACKER VISION
[2:15:19] <Kamayanna> @Louie_Salmon That it's something you never think to do is just incredible, it's so easy
[2:15:19] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> ...day of your life?
[2:15:19] <foxenco> IT'S SO GOOD
[2:15:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I was thinking the same thing
[2:15:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Pequod1 you could hear it before
[2:15:22] <KasiCrafter> I think I hear the supernova music REAL low
[2:15:23] <bippityjones> The video game was a Video Game!?
[2:15:24] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> oh
[2:15:27] <The_hidden_> haha i was waiting for the secret to be found
[2:15:27] <%Piemen99> ITS SO FUCKING COOL
[2:15:30] <HiveMasterMind> It's all a simulation & there's bugs
[2:15:31] <%Deadpal> man I love that pat is thinking EXACTLY the same way I was.
[2:15:33] <harmless_toast> b-b-b-b-baby you just ain't seen nothin' yet!
[2:15:35] <Zalapski> 999 on original DS was pretty good at the end
[2:15:38] <%RayReborne> BIGGER TWISTS THAN 13 SENTINELS????
[2:15:39] <%Valdorick> This game is an onion.
[2:15:41] <Darthkitten_Prime> I found this completely by accident
[2:15:42] <%Valdorick> Many layers
[2:15:43] <+Pequod1> @cobalt_phoenix_ groovy, i never did
[2:15:47] <cheapdoc> UNTIL YOU UDNERSTAND THAT YOU PUT ON YOUR OCULUS
[2:15:47] <+extantCadence> @Pequod1 This specific music is for the loop ending
[2:15:52] <Darthkitten_Prime> Way early on in discovering the dream world
[2:15:53] <%Mr_Pylon> Twisted twist
[2:16:02] <Louie_Salmon> This is the coolest moment in 13 Sentinels, except instead of the characters doing it in a cutscene you personally have the eureka.
[2:16:07] <%derpy_platypus> Inception
[2:16:08] <+broaches> your guiding moonlight was by your side the whole time!
[2:16:08] <Riyokuno> twist in a twist
[2:16:10] <%DrTomT18> fucking RENDER DISTANCE TURNED ALL THE WAY DOWN
[2:16:12] <%Mattais88> Inception the game
[2:16:16] <+Pequod1> @extantCadence yeah I just thought the loop music couldn't be heard in the shadow realm
[2:16:22] <AoiRob> render distance hack
[2:16:25] <+twohitgood> if it's a digital world, then why does it have consequences back in the real world?
[2:16:26] <RyuuAoi> LIES. MGS Player 2 port was best, Pat.
[2:16:28] <nomos42> one more dream secret
[2:16:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so no render distance means godvision
[2:16:28] <%RayReborne> i say again, bigger than 13 Sentinels? perhaps? Kappa
[2:16:30] <RiverBirch> But its not a double dream world
[2:16:32] <stoatacious> it's all coming together
[2:16:35] <CrematedCube> It feels like druid-magic but it's actually videogame-magic
[2:16:35] <+blaze__drag> can't wait till you get to talk to woolie on monday about NOTHING IN PARTICULAR
[2:16:36] <RiverBirch> you'er looking at the Dev-map of the dreamscape
[2:16:36] <leole11> now, the THIRD secret
[2:16:38] <MyNameIsRasus> you're still missing one area
[2:16:39] <%DrTomT18> I can't wait to see how woolie reacts to this
[2:16:39] <%Piemen99> Their PC so bad their Render distance is shit
[2:16:39] <%Spazerbeams> I wish that version of End Times was on the soundtrack, I love it
[2:16:41] <+TombstoneTTromboners> one more forbidden archive left
[2:16:47] <%Like51bears> 1 more pat,
[2:16:56] <captain_kirkhammer> The best twists are the ones where you're like I COULD HAVE DONE THAT
[2:17:09] <%DrTomT18> How are you feeling rn, Pat?
[2:17:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> im still scraping pieces of my brain off the walls
[2:17:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @captain_kirkhammer he even set it down at one point before but picked it up again after
[2:17:20] <%Deadpal> YEAH
[2:17:22] <+Mondeiya> this is why i love outer wilds mechanics
[2:17:23] <%RayReborne> Wouldve made the first area easier Kappa
[2:17:24] <%Mr_Pylon> SURE CAN'T
[2:17:26] <iosephe> Yup
[2:17:27] <%Deadpal> ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEATEN IT OR WATCHED YOUR STREAM.
[2:17:28] <%dekkitout> No snitching
[2:17:28] <Treasure_Vault> All the upgrades in this game are to your brain
[2:17:28] <%DrTomT18> I mean, you can tell Woolie
[2:17:28] <+TombstoneTTromboners> that's outer wilds baby
[2:17:29] <The_hidden_> dream in a matrix
[2:17:30] <%Mattais88> Except us
[2:17:31] <%Deadpal> IT SUCKS MAN.
[2:17:32] <%G_Thunders> Suddenly it makes sense why the dark sections are SO dark. They didn’t want you dropping the lantern
[2:17:33] <+tomdwarf> I always loved secrets where you could have done it from the start, but why would you
[2:17:33] <ZE_Count> im glad you didnt get spoiled
[2:17:34] <%Maids4lyfe> you told us
[2:17:35] <+blaze__drag> force woolie to play this game
[2:17:35] <+BloodyBurney> make woolie play it
[2:17:35] <harmless_toast> I love this game so fucking much but I can never convince anyone to play it because I can't tell them anything about it LUL
[2:17:36] <bippityjones> Time to make a Outer Wilds Spoiler Chat in the Discord
[2:17:36] <BakaTyler> NOW YOU KNOW OUR PAIN PAT ༼ ༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ༽
[2:17:38] <%cvp5127> tell woolie he'll never play it LUL
[2:17:38] <@Ranryu692> you can tell me; I wasn't paying attention
[2:17:40] <Srthunda> nintendo will tell everyone about it in a direct first
[2:17:40] <tanarath> YOU CAN TELL THEM TO PLAY THIS GAME
[2:17:40] <blastazoid00> You can tell us :)
[2:17:45] <foxenco> THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE
[2:17:46] <iosephe> It's like The Law of Quantum Imaging
[2:17:48] <leole11> literally the best game in the world and you CAN'T TELL PEOPLE WHY
[2:17:49] <%DrTomT18> did he finish it?
[2:17:54] <MyNameIsRasus> HOW DO YOU SHILL THE UNSHILLABLE
[2:17:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie didn't even finish the base game
[2:17:55] <nomos42> did he even finish it?
[2:17:57] <RyuuAoi> He will spoil it on Monday. Like the old days ha
[2:18:01] <%Mr_Pylon> He played it?
[2:18:02] <+TombstoneTTromboners> he only ever did the quick look yeah
[2:18:02] <@Ranryu692> that's almost too much
[2:18:02] <stoatacious> tell him to turn on baby mode
[2:18:04] <%Deadpal> :(
[2:18:05] <ZE_Count> its got religion woolie
[2:18:07] <%Spazerbeams> outer wilds was top 5 of all time, and this dlc makes it top 3
[2:18:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> to my knowledge, at least not on stream
[2:18:09] <%DrTomT18> He played it twice I think
[2:18:11] <CrematedCube> The darkness is functionally Superman 64 fog
[2:18:11] <%Deadpal> this *won't* be on podcast then.
[2:18:13] <%Deadpal> damn.
[2:18:13] <bippityjones> :(
[2:18:13] <+blaze__drag> didn't he only play for like an hour?
[2:18:15] <vVAstrAVv> dude im scared to even tell ppl they can put their lantern down for fear they stumble onto it lol
[2:18:15] <+tomdwarf> He played like 2-3 hours I think
[2:18:15] <ZE_Count> I thought he beat it?
[2:18:16] <tanarath> WOOLIEEEEEEEEE{EEEEEEEEEE
[2:18:18] <MyNameIsRasus> HE PLAYED LIKE 2 HOURS
[2:18:20] <%Monkeyweed21> he didnt even get close
[2:18:21] <dragonheart45> I think he did 3 parts
[2:18:25] <%DrTomT18> you gotta be FAST
[2:18:27] <RyuuAoi> Woolie couldn't even land the ship ha
[2:18:29] <nomos42> tick tock
[2:18:33] <%DrTomT18> Can I make a suggestion?
[2:18:35] <%Deadpal> >he played it for 2 hours
[2:18:36] <+blaze__drag> you got 10 Minutes GO
[2:18:36] <+Delenay> i think the water drains here after the flood makes its circle
[2:18:37] <%Deadpal> OH YEAH.
[2:18:41] <%Deadpal> woolie had the gameplay issue.
[2:18:41] <%Buzzard42> no
[2:18:47] <+Delenay> giving a second chance
[2:18:49] <%Monkeyweed21> He only played long enough to see the sun explode
[2:18:53] <foxenco> this one is hard
[2:18:55] <2midgetsinacoat> Let him figure this one out himself chat
[2:18:55] <leole11> what gameplay issue?
[2:18:56] <MyNameIsRasus> this one i found a bit tricky
[2:18:56] <%walternatorz> surely pat is doing this on purpose for a bit now, right?
[2:19:02] <+Pequod1> Oh is that the trick lol
[2:19:03] <vVAstrAVv> make sure you open the pier door in the woodlands
[2:19:03] <%TarikBot> Pat constantly undershooting jetpack jumps because hes used to 1x gravity is the theme of the whole playthrough
[2:19:08] <+blaze__drag> this one is the easiest
[2:19:08] <%Deadpal> doing... what as a bit?
[2:19:11] <+Pequod1> I just brute smarts'd it
[2:19:11] <bippityjones> @DrTomT18 We have time and we won't have to worry about the dark because of One Weird Trick Owldeer DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT
[2:19:12] <%Agami23> if it wasent for the dam breaking and the sun exploding i feel like the stranger would be a pretty cool place to live
[2:19:15] <%Deadpal> this is MY EXACT SAME THOUGHT PROCESS TOO.
[2:19:15] <baavetti> I thought woolie played the rest of it off stream
[2:19:27] <%DrTomT18> @DrTomT18 HA fair
[2:19:28] <leole11> this one i figured out before the reel that gives you a hit
[2:19:29] <%Deadpal> OH MAN
[2:19:31] <nomos42> guys let him explor first
[2:19:31] <%captain_thickthighs> I'm late so is this the capitalism game or the space hillbilly game?
[2:19:32] <%Deadpal> SEE
[2:19:34] <%Deadpal> INTO THE MATRIX PAT.
[2:19:35] <+TombstoneTTromboners> hell yeah brother
[2:19:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @baavetti he said he was going to and then didnt do that
[2:19:40] <+extantCadence> No one spoil this one!
[2:19:51] <%Deadpal> spoil this one and you die.
[2:19:52] <%Deadpal> >(
[2:19:55] <+TombstoneTTromboners> glow in the dark vision
[2:19:58] <Louie_Salmon> @captain_thickthighs The SPOILER GAME, get outta here!
[2:19:59] <%Deadpal> yeah this super helps to see.
[2:19:59] <+blaze__drag> I love the effect of being able to see into the bubble
[2:20:00] <%Deadpal> for sure.
[2:20:01] <+dj_mixd> @captain_thickthighs hillbilly
[2:20:09] <RoughBoulder22> spois get the BOP
[2:20:09] <Riyokuno> tricky one
[2:20:12] <ToastyBroDude> Sam Fisher vision
[2:20:13] <ZE_Count> da darkness
[2:20:16] <%polothegreatest> HACKERMAN
[2:20:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im so mad i found that one last
[2:20:20] <bippityjones> It's not a skybox it's a skydome
[2:20:21] <vVAstrAVv> btw you can BLOW OUT stuff in the code world
[2:20:22] <The_hidden_> he's starting to believe
[2:20:23] <+TombstoneTTromboners> oh the bridge aint even loaded
[2:20:24] <+blaze__drag> unlocking Debug mode is the most powerful I've felt in a game about not being powerful lol
[2:20:31] <+Lightning_Goat> This one I had to look up, and I don't know how long it would have taken me if I hadn't
[2:20:34] <%captain_thickthighs> good old space Florida
[2:20:37] <%Deadpal> gotta use the lantern for a few things here yeah.
[2:20:38] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Can you walk in water?
[2:20:40] <thetntm> pat IIRC what you should do is just follow the candles
[2:20:41] <mr_saturday93> I forgot that the main character has 4 eyes
[2:20:44] <%Deadpal> aww @Lightning_Goat
[2:20:46] <+twohitgood> that is not a big map to spend all of eternity.
[2:20:48] <%Deadpal> ...
[2:20:51] <%Deadpal> *drown*
[2:20:53] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[2:20:55] <+tomdwarf> no, you drown I think
[2:20:56] <%DrTomT18> no but you can die in it
[2:20:57] <+dmbender> guess not
[2:20:59] <foxenco> NO
[2:21:00] <+TombstoneTTromboners> turns out you still drown in digital water
[2:21:00] <%sirisvirus> is this how you get past the security or cheat to see the code
[2:21:01] <$dalmek> just your standard drowning
[2:21:02] <%DrTomT18> clever
[2:21:02] <bippityjones> sleep apnea
[2:21:02] <Louie_Salmon> You're not just God
[2:21:04] <%JonathLP> eh, worth a shot
[2:21:08] <heartlesshealer> love how simple the candle representations are
[2:21:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gotta test for fall damage LUL
[2:21:11] <MyNameIsRasus> worth a shot
[2:21:15] <+tomdwarf> Again, this vision isnt an alternate reality, your just seeing the dream/matrix world for what it really is.
[2:21:16] <%Piemen99> Fuck good try though
[2:21:18] <%Spazerbeams> aren't the heartheans amphibians?
[2:21:23] <%drabberfaun535> it looks like hes walking around the bitter coast with a texture error
[2:21:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're just in debug view
[2:21:29] <%YakumoYomi> Gief HATES drowners
[2:21:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat just light the candles
[2:21:43] <%Buzzard42> @Spazerbeams we're primates but you don't see people hanging from trees still
[2:21:46] <mr_saturday93> @spazerbeams they evolved from gills though
[2:21:47] <vVAstrAVv> pier
[2:21:47] <baavetti> pat you can light candles from a distance
[2:21:48] <thetntm> candles
[2:21:48] <danraven> you can light the candles here and follow them
[2:21:49] <bippityjones> light some candles
[2:21:51] <+TombstoneTTromboners> that's why you have a focus that auto lights candles pat
[2:21:52] <%SovPho> Has the dam broken yet?
[2:21:53] <%Deadpal> just light the candles yeah lol
[2:21:56] <Edsta94> hacker vision makes it more lit up
[2:21:58] <heartlesshealer> the hearthians are amphibians, but this world wasn't programmed to allow swimming I guess
[2:21:59] <+Pequod1> just left the path lol
[2:21:59] <+Lightning_Goat> Focus the beam and light the candles
[2:22:02] <%RayReborne> it was all rightside, wasnt it?
[2:22:02] <%Monkeyweed21> you immediately went off course
[2:22:04] <%Like51bears> pay you really need to light the candles
[2:22:09] <MyNameIsRasus> follow the dirt road from the start
[2:22:23] <%Deadpal> yes.
[2:22:25] <vVAstrAVv> pat its the freaking woods. not a place you get around by wall hugging
[2:22:35] <+Delenay> left at candle wasnt it

[2:31:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> imagine if the nomai probe hit the stranger lmao
[2:31:45] <%Frost_Quill> I wonder if the quantum moon can orbit this thing.
[2:31:52] <%Spazerbeams> usually my ship didn't survive landing
[2:32:00] <home2_u> check your logs
[2:32:01] <cheapdoc> I wonder, how much of this game could be skipped, by accident
[2:32:04] <%Piemen99> Have we found out we the missing space owl went?
[2:32:04] <2midgetsinacoat> he lacks critical information
[2:32:18] <leole11> he doesn't *know*
[2:32:31] <cheapdoc> @Piemen99 I don't think we have
[2:32:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he'll get it give him time
[2:32:34] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> He is non-cogniferous
[2:32:41] <%Piemen99> damn
[2:32:42] <buhbuhboat> you have all the information you need im pretty sure
[2:32:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> @cheapdoc probably all of it but it'd have to be a really big accident
[2:32:45] <bippityjones> You found tree-hole
[2:32:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> pat you HAVE to suck the owldeer's dicks
[2:33:02] <bippityjones> it's the only way
[2:33:03] <+S1rHuge> yo just got here, how's the outer wilds dlc?
[2:33:03] <Ben_Lunaris> Just create a black hole to devour the problem then collapse it before it can reach critical mass, easy solution. TPFufun
[2:33:08] <harmless_toast> If only there was a way to spend more time in that area without your flame going out
[2:33:17] <ZE_Count> he shall learn the three great secrets and be the chosen one.
[2:33:17] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> He lacks critical thinking skills LUL
[2:33:18] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> How's the progress? I've been gone for a while.
[2:33:19] <cheapdoc> @ReallyBigRocks Lucky or unluky Ted?

[2:41:43] <+TombstoneTTromboners> pat you've gotta do a backwards long jump up the stairs to clip past the fireplace
[2:41:45] <%Buzzard42> @Tisaric but have you considered not
[2:41:46] <leole11> equip fog ring
[2:41:50] <bippityjones> You want to blow them all off Pat?
[2:41:52] <%jtdobyns> debug mode?

[2:42:14] <home2_u> Reread your ship log.
[2:42:14] <HiveMasterMind> He's so close he said it but hasn't connected the dots
[2:42:16] <stoatacious> use CQC
[2:42:16] <cheapdoc> You need to find TIME STOP
[2:42:17] <%Weeabooninja> Just give the owls blowjobs so they'll be less cranky
[2:42:20] <thetntm> dam it indeed
[2:42:20] <vVAstrAVv> @harmless_toast opening a shortcut he already knows about isnt a spoiler
[2:42:21] <IHaveNoFunnyName> ADVANCED CHAT Highlighting a message to spoil
[2:42:22] <%buerdo> I know how to solve this:)
[2:42:26] <leole11> TIME STOP
[2:42:26] <+extantCadence> @bippityjones I know it's a gameplay thing and you get around it with the space suit, but your complete inability to swim or hold your breath is so weird
[2:42:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Of course! Time Stop!
[2:42:32] <%Deadpal> owljobs?
[2:42:33] <%bassoontyphoon> Keep reaching for that rainbow
[2:42:33] <%Buzzard42> @Weeabooninja it's this
[2:42:35] <%derpy_platypus> try spinning
[2:42:36] <%Mattais88> wonder what that room like with debug on?
[2:42:43] <buhbuhboat> draw an anti-owl circle
[2:42:46] <+tomdwarf> Welp. Now we wait. He;ll either get it or he wont.
[2:42:46] <RoughBoulder22> @leole11 ZA WARUDO
[2:42:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> just defeat the owls with your martial arts
[2:42:47] <nomos42> @vVAstrAVv no, that's telling him the solution
[2:42:51] <leole11> ok
[2:43:05] <+blaze__drag> when in doubt
[2:43:06] <%SovPho> it's so cool
[2:43:07] <+blaze__drag> owl murder
[2:43:10] <Ben_Lunaris> Just walk past them saying "Hoo" I'm sure they'll let you walk by then TPFufun
[2:43:10] <foxenco> @Mattais88 literally the same but you can see the owls more clearly
[2:43:12] <@GeneralSCPatton> @buhbuhboat That's an oval! It has to be a circle!
[2:43:19] <bippityjones> Luigi's Mansion 4
[2:43:20] <+TheLocalRival> Hey Pat did you just mention…Chaos?
[2:43:21] <harmless_toast> @vVAstrAVv If you don't understand what backseating and spoiling is then just stop talking in chat
[2:43:27] <$ringabal> Imagine chilling with your Chozo buddies, and this four-eyed dweeb comes stumbling into your club
[2:43:33] <leole11> oh there's owls ON THE SECOND FLOOR
[2:43:34] <+Delenay> theres a door in the back right
[2:43:35] <+TombstoneTTromboners> pat do a backwards long jump up the steps
[2:43:36] <%Frost_Quill> i just heard a door?
[2:43:36] <%Dakuu75> don't like this...
[2:43:42] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:43:45] <leole11> yeah pat, do a BLJ
[2:43:46] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat was transported to a faraway place, to a world where owlbear's rule.
[2:43:48] <RoughBoulder22> and this is another point that connecting info would be a spoiler, he knows the info he needs, he just needs to puzzle it together
[2:43:48] <2midgetsinacoat> He'll figure it out, have patience
[2:43:49] <+JustToWatch> Just think, what is the natural enemies of Owls? That's right, guns
[2:43:52] <%Buzzard42> the solution to this one came to me in the shower the next morning
[2:43:54] <+Delenay> where the one guy you follow walks towards, here is a door behind him
[2:43:55] <%DrTomT18> I'm also confused
[2:43:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> they're like "who the fuck is that guy"
[2:43:57] <%tank7013> They all slowly turn to look at you LUL
[2:43:58] <%derpy_platypus> no-clip ez
[2:43:58] <+VStan11> hydration check
[2:43:59] <%Buzzard42> it fuckin rocked
[2:44:01] <%RayReborne> so if you just stand there they will go after you eventually, hmm ok
[2:44:03] <DaCheekyOne> Are you not supposed to lead them outside?
[2:44:04] <vVAstrAVv> @harmless_toast backseating yes spoiling no. thats all
[2:44:05] <stoatacious> use your cardboard box!
[2:44:07] <cheapdoc> Do a flip
[2:44:11] <%Deadpal> I got this solution first but I spent a long time on it and didn't the others til later.
[2:44:11] <%Spazerbeams> how hard would it to ask Slate to invent a glock
[2:44:13] <%Mattais88> Feels like you're missing some live long prosper gesture
[2:44:13] <+extantCadence> Pat, offer them marshmellows to roast in their nice fireplace
[2:44:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait do you even have a model in their VR world?
[2:44:21] <%bassoontyphoon> Get the banana pat
[2:44:22] <stoatacious> pat remember the basics of CQC

[2:47:13] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[2:47:13] <%RayReborne> no time to park go go go
[2:47:14] <+blaze__drag> fuckin nailed it
[2:47:14] <leole11> the absolute disrespect for your ship :(
[2:47:15] <%Deadpal> back up in the ship
[2:47:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's just gonna make pat look even smarter
[2:47:17] <harmless_toast> See? Pat isn't gonna spoil us like you were trying to spoil him!
[2:47:17] <%Frost_Quill> Suplex the owls until the recognize you as their new king?
[2:47:22] <+blaze__drag> he's nailing it so hard
[2:47:23] <%Deadpal> let's do the time warp agaaaaaaaaaain~!
[2:47:26] <%Spazerbeams> once I landed so rough here I died due to smashing my head on my own ship
[2:47:27] <%Buzzard42> yes
[2:47:28] <%Mr_Pylon> Outer Wilds causes Star Trek moments where you say a phrase and then go wait... THE THING I JUST SAID
[2:47:29] <homestylewaffles> parking like you're out of toilet paper
[2:47:30] <%SovPho> god this DLC is so good
[2:47:30] <%barrakuta371> I love how Pat crashes the ship each time.
[2:47:33] <thetntm> pat don't forget there is a door you need to open somewhere
[2:47:34] <cheapdoc> Is the answer actually time stop?
[2:47:37] <$ringabal> @Frost_Quill God I wish
[2:47:38] <+BloodyBurney> i feel small brain right now
[2:47:39] <+blaze__drag> oh no
[2:47:43] <Ben_Lunaris> Time paradox! PogChamp
[2:47:46] <%Deadpal> FOR STYLE POINTS PAT
[2:47:47] <%Deadpal> DUH
[2:47:48] <+extantCadence> Any landing that doesn't kill you is good enough when you're landing on The Stranger
[2:47:49] <Explodincatz> Pat is moving so fast he is happy boy
[2:47:56] <%SovPho> i like having mobility options
[2:48:01] <bippityjones> Crash and then Eject
[2:48:01] <karl_rex> So they created a digital mindscape to escape the heat death of the universe?
[2:48:05] <leole11> oh, he doesn't know
[2:48:07] <CrematedCube> @Spazerbeams That was actually the first thing he did this stream
[2:48:07] <%Spazerbeams> this game is pretty good
[2:48:08] <leole11> oh no
[2:48:08] <thetntm> pat's not going to make it this loop
[2:48:10] <%derpy_platypus> ship just gonna blow up in 20 minutes anyway
[2:48:10] <2midgetsinacoat> Nevermind he's not big brain
[2:48:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> does crashing better mean you land worse?
[2:48:13] <%MrUnKnownAlien> just eject pot into new ship lol
[2:48:13] <vVAstrAVv> just hit eject baka
[2:48:15] <bippityjones> aww man

[2:48:22] <+BloodyBurney> OH I GET IT
[2:48:23] <%Deadpal> pat has this guys
[2:48:24] <leole11> he lacks a critical detail
[2:48:26] <nomos42> let him work on it
[2:48:28] <not_twitter_rowan> @karl_rex nah they just missed their home planet
[2:48:28] <%Valdorick> OH... that tower collapses first.
[2:48:28] <Ben_Lunaris> @karl_rex Partially?
[2:48:32] <%Deadpal> he psaBig 🧠
[2:48:36] <%twoto858> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:48:39] <%Spazerbeams> @crematedcube I wasn't here for the very start that's so good
[2:48:40] <Darthkitten_Prime> He has it, guys let him do it.
[2:48:45] <%bassoontyphoon> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[2:48:55] <not_twitter_rowan> passing the time until the universe ends
[2:48:57] <%barrakuta371> A lass
[2:48:57] <stoatacious> uhhhhhh
[2:48:57] <%Spazerbeams> he's getting there just let him figure it out
[2:48:57] <%Buzzard42> that's pretty accurate, yeah
[2:49:02] <leole11> you're on a really good track
[2:49:04] <Frogwash> Two piece is exactly right funnilty enough
[2:49:08] <foxenco> Yup pretty much
[2:49:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> I literally don't know what's going on but yeyeye lessgooo
[2:49:13] <vVAstrAVv> just 1 peice
[2:49:14] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, he can make it. Just leave him alone
[2:49:14] <+Delenay> there was a door behind the one guy, he probably moves on and makes room for the next wave of chickens
[2:49:15] <MyNameIsRasus> you're getting there
[2:49:17] <%Monkeyweed21> the big stickler is those burnt codes
[2:49:18] <RoughBoulder22> you likely are closer than you think
[2:49:19] <+TombstoneTTromboners> :)
[2:49:21] <%G_Thunders> Can’t believe how super well this is going to work
[2:49:29] <CrematedCube> Very close to a mental connection
[2:49:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh yeah there was a sarcophagus
[2:49:31] <%Mr_Pylon> all will be revealed
[2:49:32] <$dalmek> you're doing a good job pat
[2:49:35] <cheapdoc> I am so confused
[2:49:36] <leole11> it'd be a shame if it didn't work
[2:49:42] <%jtdobyns> he went long way
[2:49:42] <+blaze__drag> this is gonna be so good
[2:49:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> I forgot about that when my brain exploded earlier
[2:49:44] <home2_u> You are getting there
[2:49:45] <Ben_Lunaris> @PatStaresAt What would an Elder God do? TPFufun
[2:49:48] <+blaze__drag> I can't wait
[2:49:58] <nomos42> don't forget this zone has a shortcut and it's own artifact
[2:50:01] <harmless_toast> @Delenay there is, but it just goes up to a dead end second level. Maybe they fly away?
[2:50:04] <leole11> ye
[2:50:08] <RyuuAoi> @cheapdoc Me too. Just roll with it!
[2:50:11] <%Weeabooninja> He is smart because he has infinite think time
[2:50:15] <HiveMasterMind> not quite but sure
[2:50:16] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt you dont have to be smart if you have infinite time to think
[2:50:19] <%SovPho> It's at the breach
[2:50:20] <leole11> on the projector room
[2:50:21] <cheapdoc> @RyuuAoi Oh, I will
[2:50:23] <%Deadpal> in the lab?
[2:50:23] <leole11> across the bridge
[2:50:23] <%drabberfaun535> easy to sound smart in a ground hog day situation
[2:50:23] <+extantCadence> @karl_rex Angry homesick owls craft a massive Give-Up Machine, hide their deepest, darkest secrets inside, and then stay inside it literally until they die
[2:50:24] <Darthkitten_Prime> It's in the slide room
[2:50:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> nice
[2:50:25] <%Valdorick> Its the projector reoom
[2:50:27] <+blaze__drag> it's literally in the building where they make them
[2:50:29] <%Mattais88> projecter home
[2:50:30] <%Monkeyweed21> in the projector room
[2:50:32] <%Deadpal> yeah
[2:50:32] <nomos42> there's 2 actually
[2:50:39] <%Deadpal> you's welcome pat <3
[2:50:43] <IHaveNoFunnyName> You can also get here very quickly
[2:50:45] <%DrTomT18> what do you think you missed here?
[2:50:46] <+blaze__drag> and that shortcut has like 5 of them
[2:50:47] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Oh you just said that
[2:50:48] <samsara_vt> astronauts tend to be smart fellows dont they
[2:50:53] <+TombstoneTTromboners> secret elevator bridge!!
[2:50:53] <harmless_toast> yeah, through the lab where they developed the artifact, which has boxes full of them LUL
[2:50:55] <vVAstrAVv> projecter room and the shortcut lab
[2:50:55] <+TombstoneTTromboners> oh
[2:50:57] <%Deadpal> were not quite far enough
[2:50:57] <%Valdorick> Wrong location
[2:50:58] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[2:50:58] <aeonicVector> yoo far left
[2:50:58] <%Deadpal> lol
[2:51:02] <thetntm> lol
[2:51:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:51:03] <%derpy_platypus> thats the wrong number
[2:51:05] <+extantCadence> It's a bit further to the right
[2:51:06] <cheapdoc> Hilarious tho
[2:51:10] <harmless_toast> zoeyNail
[2:51:11] <%Deadpal> little further
[2:51:11] <Frogwash> Tree to tree
[2:51:13] <buhbuhboat> just enter the matrix
[2:51:15] <Explodincatz> dont check just yolo
[2:51:16] <+extantCadence> You have to drop onto a slightly lower ledge
[2:51:23] <%RayReborne> an inch to the right Kappa
[2:51:29] <+B3AROTAN> idk how tf I got here, my phone just opened up Pat's stream in my pocket
[2:51:39] <harmless_toast> but where's the other end?
[2:51:40] <%Deadpal> the 2nd tree!
[2:51:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> debug view
[2:51:58] <%Deadpal> the treet to tree
[2:52:01] <%SovPho> Yo what
[2:52:03] <%SovPho> what
[2:52:03] <%Deadpal> yeyeye such a good shortcut.
[2:52:09] <%Deadpal> I didn't learn about this one until after I beat the game.
[2:52:15] <%athuramn> that is so cool
[2:52:20] <%SovPho> omfg I hate my life I didn't know about that
[2:52:22] <cheapdoc> This is such a good Kingsfield game
[2:52:23] <%Spazerbeams> @deadpal yeah me too
[2:52:32] <+extantCadence> Pat forgot critical information
[2:52:33] <2midgetsinacoat> Jehovah begins with an I...
[2:52:36] <Radioactivetaco9> I beat the game and I didnt know at all
[2:52:37] <@GeneralSCPatton> Very large game
[2:52:39] <%SovPho> Pat about to be cockblocked by a door
[2:52:43] <thetntm> myst 2 electric boogaloo
[2:52:49] <vVAstrAVv> that shortcuts a godsend on the stealth section too
[2:52:50] <%derpy_platypus> what happens when you float the lamp down the river without you?
[2:52:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> when i first saw that i wondered if there'd be any other non important invisible bridges but never checked, glad to see i was right
[2:52:53] <%Deadpal> sov lol yeah.
[2:53:01] <%Deadpal> NYOOOM
[2:53:01] <%Spazerbeams> @sovpho let him see...
[2:53:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> raft is really schmoovin rn
[2:53:06] <+Delenay> what does this place look outside the dream
[2:53:08] <thetntm> time for pat to meet his age old enemy
[2:53:16] <%Deadpal> delenay ?
[2:53:16] <$ringabal> Think about Raft
[2:53:19] <CrematedCube> I mean, you can beat the original without finding the time paradoxes
[2:53:23] <%Deadpal> @Delenay what do you mean?
[2:53:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you made it!
[2:53:28] <%Piemen99> ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
[2:53:32] <%Frost_Quill> oh yeah what's the bell look like without the artifact

[2:53:36] <%Maids4lyfe> is this the pirates of the caribbean ride
[2:53:41] <+Delenay> the bell room, what does it look like in true vr
[2:53:46] <%derpy_platypus> forgot one thing though
[2:53:47] <+TombstoneTTromboners> OH NO A DOOR
[2:53:48] <%Deadpal> @SovPho at least he has time to go and fix it.
[2:53:48] <%SovPho> @Spazerbeams that's not even a spoiler
[2:53:48] <2midgetsinacoat> WOOPS
[2:53:49] <%Valdorick> LUL

[2:54:00] <%RayReborne> WELP
[2:54:01] <thetntm> this exact thing happened in my playthrough
[2:54:02] <$ringabal> THE WORST ENEMY OF ALL
[2:54:02] <%Deadpal> well. now you know!
[2:54:02] <danraven> yyyup
[2:54:03] <leole11> hehehehehe
[2:54:03] <MartyFun11> You have to open it from the other side first
[2:54:04] <leole11> told ya
[2:54:06] <AoiRob> he forgor
[2:54:06] <stoatacious> pat's going hollow
[2:54:07] <%Deadpal> you know what to do now.
[2:54:07] <RiverBirch> and now you know
[2:54:07] <hellfirejefe> shits locked
[2:54:08] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmfao
[2:54:08] <+Lightning_Goat> You were like 99% there
[2:54:08] <%SovPho> cockblocked
[2:54:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NOW he's got it
[2:54:10] <Ben_Lunaris> Time is relative to you're knowledge TPFufun
[2:54:13] <leole11> get trolled nerd
[2:54:13] <+Delenay> im expecting invisible paths in each of these
[2:54:14] <harmless_toast> your big brain wasn't big enough!
[2:54:14] <home2_u> LET'S GO
[2:54:16] <%Valdorick> That's AMAZING, it forces you to use your time to do the thing.
[2:54:17] <%Deadpal> that reaction was EXCELLENT.
[2:54:17] <CrematedCube> Gotta shortcut it first
[2:54:19] <Forbidden_Karp> man I hate doors
[2:54:19] <%Deadpal> 10/10
[2:54:20] <+blaze__drag> I was waiting so hard lol
[2:54:22] <Forbidden_Karp> always getting in my way
[2:54:26] <home2_u> back at it again
[2:54:26] <foxenco> Brainblocked
[2:54:26] <Forbidden_Karp> obstructing my forward motion
[2:54:27] <%bassoontyphoon> FortHype psaBig psaPat
[2:54:28] <+blaze__drag> NOW he's got it
[2:54:28] <CrematedCube> but we thinking good
[2:54:29] <harmless_toast> don't worry, you have plenty of time to do this
[2:54:29] <Explodincatz> 1-1
[2:54:31] <%Spazerbeams> now he 100% got it
[2:54:38] <+blaze__drag> FOr real this time
[2:54:39] <leole11> now it's on
[2:54:42] <%SovPho> I got stuck at this part because I forgot how to open the door.
[2:54:43] <leole11> it's solved
[2:54:47] <+blaze__drag> I'm glad nobody pointed out his folly
[2:54:49] <%tank7013> It's structured to make you wait fo rless time at least
[2:54:58] <+Delenay> also im pretty sure i saw the swamp place drain out after the flood does its circut
[2:55:01] <+blaze__drag> space suits are for wimps
[2:55:12] <+blaze__drag> you can probably get in without one
[2:55:16] <+Delenay> that room was above the water after the bridge broke
[2:55:18] <+blaze__drag> actually now I wonder
[2:55:24] <%Like51bears> this is my favorite set of reels in the game coming up
[2:55:26] <+Delenay> but then again the fires probably out
[2:55:42] <%Buzzard42> it's like Dark Bramble where it resets your momentum
[2:55:49] <$dalmek> what a nice safety feature
[2:55:50] <%Buzzard42> probably a quirk of the way loading zones work in the game
[2:55:52] <%Mattais88> did you ever check out that glitch on the outside of the halo?
[2:55:58] <KasiCrafter> Makes sense. Don't want a stray asteroid to wreck your ship
[2:55:59] <%barrakuta371> Hey he crashed good that time
[2:56:04] <%RayReborne> so this games runs pretty good on Switch Pat??
[2:56:05] <+Lightning_Goat> The next set of reels are pretty damn good yeah
[2:56:06] <$ringabal> @PatStaresAt It's more of a softload for the new area, which is also why there's no visible model
[2:56:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Delenay ya once fire's out you're done
[2:56:12] <%derpy_platypus> straight into a fish
[2:56:25] <%Buzzard42> @RayReborne is the switch port even out yet
[2:56:38] <Edsta94> is outer wilds still 30fps on consoles?
[2:56:39] <danraven> switch version hasn't come out yet
[2:56:40] <%SovPho> nope
[2:56:43] <+Lightning_Goat> Yeah this is probably the most difficult puzzle imo
[2:56:45] <%dasmause> SIMP
[2:56:58] <foxenco> Yeah, googled the solution for this one
[2:56:58] <%RayReborne> @buzzard42 of outer wilds? uuhh yes, for a while im pretty sure
[2:57:08] <bippityjones> Step 0: Be an Owldeer
[2:57:08] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yeah i felt super smart after banging my head against it for way too long
[2:57:09] <vVAstrAVv> hardest to figure out but easiest to execute
[2:57:13] <%RayReborne> oh ok
[2:57:15] <leole11> i got this solution before getting any hint reels
[2:57:17] <harmless_toast> you chose a good order to do these three areas in
[2:57:25] <nomos42> nope
[2:57:28] <Explodincatz> these stealth sections are stupid yea
[2:57:30] <%derpy_platypus> fill your dark soul with light
[2:57:31] <2midgetsinacoat> it's right by the entrance
[2:57:33] <foxenco> nope
[2:57:35] <%RayReborne> oops, i assumed switch lol idk why
[2:57:37] <%Valdorick> It was a bridge near the water?
[2:57:42] <+Lightning_Goat> It's back at the fork across the small wooden bridge near the entrance
[2:57:45] <%Deadpal> it was right at the start
[2:57:48] <2midgetsinacoat> so far past it
[2:57:50] <foxenco> by the entrance go right and then left
[2:57:54] <%Deadpal> yeah.
[2:57:56] <%Monkeyweed21> just follow the candles
[2:57:59] <%Deadpal> look around
[2:58:01] <aeonicVector> the shortcut
[2:58:04] <home2_u> too far, go back
[2:58:04] <leole11> pat forgot
[2:58:14] <%Like51bears> psaBlind psaBlind
[2:58:15] <harmless_toast> just walked right past it LUL
[2:58:15] <%Deadpal> THERE
[2:58:20] <RoughBoulder22> NotLikeThis
[2:58:22] <%Deadpal> thank god lol
[2:58:23] <Ben_Lunaris> You have to think like an eldritch being that has no concept of time being limited, come on it's easy rbzEZ
[2:58:27] <+extantCadence> Pat blind
[2:58:27] <vVAstrAVv> look for a bridge
[2:58:30] <%Deadpal> yep
[2:58:30] <%Dakuu75> are you guys saying he should follow the light source? What new tech is this???
[2:58:32] <+TombstoneTTromboners> good work
[2:58:34] <%Deadpal> okay now you're good to go!
[2:58:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> question, if I never played based game but showed interest, am I spoiling myself by watching this?
[2:58:39] <%Valdorick> It just wastes your time.
[2:58:39] <+TombstoneTTromboners> now jump in the lake
[2:58:39] <%derpy_platypus> gg
[2:58:40] <%Deadpal> LOL
[2:58:40] <nomos42> water
[2:58:42] <bippityjones> Now to kill time for most of a loop
[2:58:44] <%Deadpal> JUST GONNA GO BACK IN THERE HUH
[2:58:47] <%athuramn> athuramn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! I showed my friend 10 puns hoping one would make them laugh but no pun in 10 did. Thanks for being a cool dude
[2:58:50] <%Valdorick> Yeet yourself into the water
[2:58:50] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @GalacticaPhanto yes
[2:58:52] <%TarikBot> This man has played dark souls
[2:59:00] <%Deadpal> ?
[2:59:04] <%Deadpal> huh.
[2:59:05] <aeonicVector> yes
[2:59:07] <%Spazerbeams> quantum Moon?
[2:59:08] <+Lightning_Goat> @GalacticaPhanto I'd say yeah, there's a lot that ties into the base game
[2:59:12] <%Deadpal> hmm.
[2:59:14] <%RayReborne> SUDDENLY MORE LANTERNS AT THE ENTRANCE??????
[2:59:17] <leole11> oh yeah
[2:59:22] <leole11> in that reagard, yes
[2:59:26] <Frogwash> This is way more lenient
[2:59:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RayReborne he put em there
[2:59:28] <%Deadpal> @RayReborne nah he put those there
[2:59:34] <%SovPho> I like it because it keeps in with the theme "learn rules, apply them."
[2:59:40] <harmless_toast> @RayReborne he put those there 'cause he was flailing around and moving the wrong ones
[2:59:44] <%RayReborne> pff lol i thought he just moved two of them
[2:59:47] <HiveMasterMind> I'd say this is more like the Black Hole Forge
[2:59:49] <%Deadpal> oh it's super specific and hard lol pat.
[2:59:50] <%Buzzard42> yes
[2:59:52] <%Spazerbeams> I hope you remember soon lol
[2:59:52] <%RayReborne> oh lo
[2:59:53] <+TombstoneTTromboners> :)
[2:59:55] <%Deadpal> yeah
[2:59:56] <leole11> no, you DON'T get sucked up
[2:59:56] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:59:56] <%Valdorick> Yes
[2:59:56] <%RayReborne> lol
[2:59:58] <%Buzzard42> that's exactly how
[2:59:58] <tanarath> Yep
[2:59:58] <%Deadpal> this is balck hole forge.
[3:00:02] <+extantCadence> If you set the artifact down, you get to live in the water just long enough to actually drown. Fun times.
[3:00:08] <BakaTyler> Echoes of the Eye, in general, just feels like a more polished execution of all the base game's ideas
[3:00:10] <nomos42> I think they added a thing to make it a bit easier
[3:00:11] <$dalmek> yeah pretty much
[3:00:15] <harmless_toast> spoilers! but yeah LUL
[3:00:22] <vVAstrAVv> litterally the opposite but go off lol
[3:00:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @extantCadence in a dream tho doesn't count Kappa
[3:00:24] <thetntm> no you have to find the tower leading to the core of the ash twin and teleport there first
[3:00:25] <+Lightning_Goat> Ash Twin Project is running into the portal underneath the broken spire on Ash Twin while Ember is overhead
[3:00:32] <+blaze__drag> man someone should make a whole series of games about exploring ringworlds
[3:00:34] <2midgetsinacoat> That's the only part I had to use a guide for
[3:00:37] <Saltmeisterr> Oh hey @BakaTyler
[3:00:39] <cheapdoc> Could you bumblefuck your way through dark bramble?
[3:00:52] <+Lightning_Goat> @cheapdoc I highly doubt it tbh
[3:01:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cheapdoc technically yes
[3:01:06] <%Deadpal> weird and gud.
[3:01:08] <+Lightning_Goat> You really have to follow the signals to move forward in Bramble
[3:01:12] <BakaTyler> Worm and I beat it like last night I think
[3:01:13] <Edsta94> @cheapdoc practically impossible
[3:01:14] <ZE_Count> could paige play this game or would the space kill her?
[3:01:15] <thetntm> have you noticed that those elevators are easier to operate with the lanters
[3:01:16] <%Deadpal> you can ONLY TALK TO PEOPLE WHO BEAT IT.
[3:01:24] <bippityjones> YO WHAT IF THEY
[3:01:33] <%athuramn> huh, there were less lanterns this time?
[3:01:33] <$dalmek> it's one of those things where you hint and the other person goes "OH YEAH THAT WAS COOL" but never outright say what it was
[3:01:33] <%Buzzard42> people who beat it can talk to you as you play it
[3:01:38] <BakaTyler> I have SO much to say but can't talk about it. Peak 13 Sentinels-disesae bakatyWeh
[3:01:41] <%Buzzard42> and siphon off some of your fun
[3:01:44] <$ringabal> The cross that mystery players must bear
[3:01:44] <%Mr_Pylon> I've talked with friends who've played it about WHEN we each discovered certain things, which was usually different
[3:01:49] <%Buzzard42> like some kind of fun vampire
[3:01:49] <+blaze__drag> it's a game that wants to be shared, but must be played alone
[3:01:51] <+TombstoneTTromboners> now it's the waiting game for the flood
[3:01:52] <%Spazerbeams> "that part was so cool" -me talking about every part of this game
[3:02:03] <harmless_toast> I can never convince anyone to play this game because I can't tell them anything about it LUL
[3:02:03] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[3:02:05] <%Deadpal> LUL
[3:02:05] <%Buzzard42> F
[3:02:05] <%Valdorick> LUL
[3:02:06] <GoogleyGareth> LUL
[3:02:07] <thetntm> CRAZY TALK
[3:02:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:02:08] <Edsta94> @buzzard42 spoils the experience if you get someone backseating, more rewarding when you do it alone
[3:02:10] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[3:02:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> biffed
[3:02:11] <+extantCadence> Some people apparently say the dlc doesn't recapture the magic of the base game or something like that, and those people have no idea what they're talking about
[3:02:11] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:02:11] <GoogleyGareth> yeah great
[3:02:13] <%Like51bears> its fine you have lots of time
[3:02:13] <+blaze__drag> light on the right lol
[3:02:15] <%barrakuta371> welp
[3:02:15] <+Lightning_Goat> Okay real talk, which planet is best planet
[3:02:17] <Joltiness> rip in pieces
[3:02:19] <2midgetsinacoat> it's an OK shortcut
[3:02:20] <RyuuAoi> @ze_count Remember Baba is you? Idk ha
[3:02:22] <ZE_Count> keep it stright
[3:02:23] <%polothegreatest> psaMenace psaCrazy psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead
[3:02:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> psaCrazy
[3:02:28] <%walternatorz> pat is uncanny
[3:02:29] <CrematedCube> "I can't say anything about it except go and play it"
[3:02:31] <vVAstrAVv> so not directly at tree lol
[3:02:35] <Ben_Lunaris> FailFish
[3:02:35] <%bassoontyphoon> psaBig psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[3:02:41] <cheapdoc> Pat, can you Crazy Talk me into getting a job?
[3:02:42] <+extantCadence> The bridge goes to the left of the tree at the bottom
[3:02:47] <%Mr_Pylon> @Lightning_Goat Brittle Hollow for sure
[3:02:57] <%Valdorick> owl
[3:02:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> hoot
[3:03:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Lightning_Goat brittle hollow, it has no deep ocean or anglerfish, or crushing sand
[3:03:02] <%Spazerbeams> who?
[3:03:03] <foxenco> Brtittle Hollow
[3:03:08] <+blaze__drag> your face is an owl symbol
[3:03:09] <%Piemen99> oooooohhhh
[3:03:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> "We're owl exterminators."
[3:03:18] <+TombstoneTTromboners> man these owl freaks only have two eyes, unlike the nomai with 3 and hearthians with 4
[3:03:20] <%RetroCop87> this part must look cool without the lantern
[3:03:21] <+extantCadence> Pat was just messing around to pass the time before the dam breaks
[3:03:21] <$Stratiotai2> Stratiotai2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! Pat, you gonna dip your toes into new world?
[3:03:22] <RoughBoulder22> even I didn't notice and I've beaten it, how the hell
[3:03:24] <+Lightning_Goat> I'm glad everyone agrees, Brittle Hollow is just super chill to explore
[3:03:25] <captain_kirkhammer> zorbiting the Brittle Hollow black hole is so fun
[3:03:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> can you imagine only having two eyes
[3:03:32] <thetntm> Timber hearth is the best plannet to live in
[3:03:32] <nomos42> @extantCadence I managed to miss a major hint line and had to work stuff out like the fire and invisible bridge on my own, so I didn't enjoy it as much
[3:03:40] <tanarath> Don't
[3:03:40] <%Deadpal> it's just another mmo.
[3:03:40] <harmless_toast> new world look really boring
[3:03:42] <%Piemen99> RAFTING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
[3:03:42] <%Deadpal> unlike this.
[3:03:44] <Ben_Lunaris> Space Time Lord dies to gravity and mind goblins, seems about right rbzLul
[3:03:44] <%polothegreatest> fry your 3090s LUL
[3:03:47] <aeonicVector> Its prob a fun game to PLAY, but yeah dont stream
[3:03:50] <Joltiness> If you notice, the lamp's inner decoration is the upper part of a Husky dog's head!
[3:03:54] <$ArcanumArcanum> New World is just 3d Runescape
[3:03:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol no
[3:03:58] <%SovPho> lol why did they even make it an MMO for their first game
[3:03:59] <%Stratiotai2> Its not so bad actually
[3:04:00] <ssks123> @PatStaresAt i spent 3 hours in a queue for new world and then got kicked for being tabbed out
[3:04:03] <%SovPho> so gdang stupid
[3:04:04] <NeroInfinite> Yeah Newworld is kinda..ass
[3:04:04] <%Deadpal> @harmless_toast It's a bit more than that but it's boring as hell to watch.
[3:04:05] <%bassoontyphoon> Thank fuck pol
[3:04:07] <ssks123> so yeah
[3:04:10] <%bassoontyphoon> Lol*
[3:04:13] <stoatacious> does new world have fishing as good as FFXIV? no? well ok then
[3:04:17] <aeonicVector> LUL
[3:04:17] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[3:04:21] <Estuko> @ArcanumArcanum if my Runescape isn't polygonal and goofy then why would I ever bother touching
[3:04:23] <thetntm> @extantCadence I mean if you missed stuff due to not exploring thourghouly that's your own fault IMO
[3:04:26] <homestylewaffles> @SovPho cloud testing
[3:04:27] <%Deadpal> @stoatacious no.
[3:04:31] <%Valdorick> How long until they die?
[3:04:35] <danraven> if only amazon would have server capacity
[3:04:36] <ssks123> afaik the servers each can only hold like 2000 people
[3:04:39] <ssks123> and its not enough lmao
[3:04:44] <%RetroCop87> THING-UH
[3:04:50] <harmless_toast> yeah, 'cause you focused on them...
[3:04:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt New World may have caused AWS servers to have problems in other things lol
[3:04:55] <bippityjones> No more Prog Rock
[3:05:00] <%Valdorick> fuck
[3:05:02] <foxenco> DONT GO YET
[3:05:02] <+TombstoneTTromboners> flood hasn't happened yet
[3:05:04] <$ringabal> OH GOD
[3:05:05] <home2_u> wait for them to die first
[3:05:09] <+Lightning_Goat> Owl Boy has come to show you the way!
[3:05:09] <2midgetsinacoat> dont die
[3:05:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> spotted
[3:05:12] <%Spazerbeams> now we wait
[3:05:13] <+blaze__drag> use the gun!
[3:05:14] <bippityjones> Yeah just wait for the dam
[3:05:14] <+tomdwarf> Pat, you can just wait
[3:05:14] <Forbidden_Karp> sounds almost like the Songbird
[3:05:15] <+BloodyBurney> dont you wanna hang out?
[3:05:18] <%Monkeyweed21> still alive
[3:05:18] <cheapdoc> What are you gonna do once you get there? just wait, I guess
[3:05:21] <harmless_toast> Conceal, don't feel!
[3:05:23] <%Like51bears> wait it out like its cross tekken
[3:05:23] <Ben_Lunaris> MMO but servers can only hold 2k, that sounds like nonsense rbzLul
[3:05:27] <Kosinkadink> im vibin
[3:05:27] <nomos42> could pass time at a fire
[3:05:28] <leole11> ntm
[3:05:30] <+Mondeiya> i wonder what the outer wild teams next project is
[3:05:34] <%Deadpal> uhhh not much. Just updating my switch and getting it ready for metroid dread.
[3:05:34] <+BloodyBurney> this game is great
[3:05:35] <%Mattais88> Playing Melty Blood
[3:05:35] <+blaze__drag> I wanna pet an owl now
[3:05:35] <%Valdorick> We're great... still being chased?
[3:05:35] <%Spazerbeams> I finished Echoes of the eye, it's good
[3:05:36] <%Mr_Pylon> I'm making chicken stock
[3:05:36] <aeonicVector> nothing much, just grinding out blue mage spells
[3:05:37] <bippityjones> I got fudge with raisins in it
[3:05:37] <%Agami23> played lots of melty blood. not good at the game but having fun
[3:05:38] <%Piemen99> Chillen
[3:05:38] <@Ranryu692> Dave's not here, man
[3:05:38] <%barrakuta371> I got new glasses
[3:05:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> watching some guy play outer wilds in baby mode
[3:05:39] <ZE_Count> beating this game
[3:05:40] <%DrTomT18> Pat, will you try the Destroy All Humans 2 remake?
[3:05:40] <%twoto858> not much
[3:05:41] <+Lightning_Goat> Nothin much, just working on getting google UX certification
[3:05:41] <$vehementvadr> I ranger rolled socks
[3:05:42] <%derpy_platypus> waiting for the heat death of the univers
[3:05:44] <+twohitgood> it's weird how new world is such bad PR for AWS
[3:05:44] <foxenco> Playing Melty
[3:05:45] <%Monkeyweed21> GAA is GREAT
[3:05:45] <RyuuAoi> Eating ramen. Having a drink.
[3:05:46] <vVAstrAVv> pat every time you avoid the intended way you catch trouble lol
[3:05:47] <Joltiness> Did you notice the lamp's inner decoration is a husky?
[3:05:48] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> im high as fuck
[3:05:48] <Explodincatz> show dog feet
[3:05:49] <cheapdoc> Melty blood is hit and miss
[3:05:51] <NeroInfinite> playin videojams
[3:05:51] <%polothegreatest> just drinking
[3:05:52] <+Vigonept> work sucks and jobs are stupid
[3:05:56] <Kosinkadink> heard you can't name yourself Bezos
[3:05:59] <+extantCadence> @Ben_Lunaris Wow those are classic Runescape numbers
[3:06:00] <%Spazerbeams> will new world last longer than 2 months?
[3:06:00] <leole11> i bought no man's sky for myself as an early bday gift :)
[3:06:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> I got some doritos a minute ago
[3:06:04] <%buerdo> Making gunpla
[3:06:10] <%bassoontyphoon> I dealt with my first coproemesis patient today, it was horrible!
[3:06:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Kosinkadink cowards
[3:06:10] <stoatacious> I'm 300k points away from the million points ocean fishing achievement in FFXIV!
[3:06:12] <%polothegreatest> AND PAY TAXES INTHERE LUL
[3:06:15] <+blaze__drag> why would Amazon spend money on servers gawd
[3:06:16] <%dekkitout> That's the only punchline about the game I've heard
[3:06:16] <%baka_sugoi> BEZZO MUNEY
[3:06:18] <RyuuAoi> @battle_of_the_meat Jealous
[3:06:22] <tanarath> They server quality is worse than player-run private mmo servers
[3:06:24] <stoatacious> 3 million I mean
[3:06:24] <captain_kirkhammer> It's almost as though you don't actually need to provide superior service to become a monopoly
[3:06:25] <harmless_toast> bezos's nephew is running it out of his garage
[3:06:26] <aeonicVector> LUL
[3:06:27] <+dmbender> wait no way really?
[3:06:28] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:06:28] <blaflegume> New World's gameplay and abilities look really shallow.
[3:06:28] <+BloodyBurney> how is the dog is he cute?
[3:06:30] <cheapdoc> Can you Crazy Talk me into a better job so that I can give you a shit zillion dollars?
[3:06:33] <tanarath> REALLY
[3:06:33] <foxenco> People always underestimate servers for videogames
[3:06:36] <Ben_Lunaris> RS is across 400 servers though
[3:06:36] <+blaze__drag> But yeah I mean that's the thing about these companies like Amazon getting into gaming
[3:06:40] <%Monkeyweed21> the content is apparently really sparse, so who knows
[3:06:40] <%RetroCop87> that's exagerated, the article says that you pay less taxes as you get more well known
[3:06:41] <CrematedCube> Amazon runs professional server farms, they apparently also suck at it
[3:06:43] <%CatastropheCorvid> What? How?
[3:06:44] <%Mattais88> @cheapdoc As long as youre the one hitting you win.
[3:06:47] <+blaze__drag> they think that they can just throw together a team and pump out a hit
[3:06:49] <Joltiness> It draws on Bezos experience, ofc.
[3:06:53] <+Vigonept> LIKE REAL TAXES?!
[3:06:54] <%Valdorick> owl snuffing
[3:06:54] <RyuuAoi> Tell that to Blade, Pat!
[3:06:55] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yeah
[3:06:56] <%SveriSageAdvice> you'll HEAR it
[3:06:59] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you'll hear it too
[3:06:59] <2midgetsinacoat> Do you want to explain your strat to people in chat who haven't figured it out?
[3:06:59] <Radioactivetaco9> youll hear it happen
[3:07:00] <MartyFun11> You're gonna hear it
[3:07:00] <nomos42> more hear it
[3:07:01] <$OranHexthief> it has horrible queues in exchange for not having crashing servers. that part specifically is probably going to be the roadmap for all future MMO launches and expansions @PatStaresAt
[3:07:01] <$dalmek> you'll hear it
[3:07:03] <%Spazerbeams> we use Amazon servers at work. they aren't good
[3:07:05] <harmless_toast> well you'll stop seeing them at least
[3:07:05] <$ringabal> Oh you'll know
[3:07:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you're gonna hear it
[3:07:07] <+Mondeiya> yes
[3:07:10] <+tomdwarf> youll probably hear them screaming yeah
[3:07:11] <nomos42> they cycle
[3:07:12] <tanarath> They scream, Pat
[3:07:12] <bosssbatttle> yea
[3:07:13] <%DrTomT18> you'll hear them scream
[3:07:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh yeah they scream when they die remember
[3:07:13] <%Valdorick> SQEEK SQEEK
[3:07:14] <%Mr_Pylon> Oh you'll hear it
[3:07:14] <%Deadpal> You'll know pat.
[3:07:15] <leole11> yes
[3:07:15] <$dalmek> ah, good point
[3:07:16] <@Ranryu692> LUL
[3:07:16] <Darthkitten_Prime> Absolutely.
[3:07:16] <+TombstoneTTromboners> I am sure
[3:07:17] <thetntm> you'll definitely hear it
[3:07:17] <thehornypastrypuffer> yeah man
[3:07:18] <%bassoontyphoon> 👂
[3:07:18] <%polothegreatest> just hype it will never thrive psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead

[3:07:20] <+Lightning_Goat> Remember the screams you keep hearing in the distance?
[3:07:20] <cheapdoc> @Mattais88 I tend to be the one missing
[3:07:21] <%buerdo> Hear it too
[3:07:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> we'll tell you how about that
[3:07:22] <harmless_toast> you've heard it before, you just didn't know what it was

[3:10:38] <%Valdorick> wait... what happens... fi you... don't have your lamp during the lamp?
[3:10:38] <EternalJedi> IT'S A BUG REPORT
[3:10:41] <Kamayanna> It's easy to say "wow what idiots" but remember that the Nomai were similarly like "HOLY SHIT GET THERE NOWWWW" so the signal's just some hype shit

[3:10:48] <CrematedCube> ?
[3:10:52] <HiveMasterMind> They used literally everything they had to get here & all they get is a kill the universe button
[3:10:53] <%Deadpal> THAT'S IT.
[3:10:54] <leole11> "bro there's no collision when you load"
[3:10:55] <+blaze__drag> this game is so good at secretly loading things that the one obvious loading screen in the game is fake lol
[3:10:55] <CrematedCube> Die during the loading?
[3:10:57] <NeroInfinite> so they literalyl ate their own home planet????? jesus

[3:11:03] <IzanagiNoOokami> Pranked
[3:11:03] <ZE_Count> you now know the three secrets
[3:11:03] <cheapdoc> You know what, that's fair, they're justified into being pissed
[3:11:05] <bippityjones> Class b: Non-gamebreaking
[3:11:08] <RoughBoulder22> it all comes in threes
[3:11:08] <+tomdwarf> GET ON A BOAT
[3:11:09] <%Buzzard42> say the secret out loud pat

[3:11:11] <%Spazerbeams> you have everything
[3:11:14] <%whyskeywolfe> Wait, what’s the secret?
[3:11:15] <%Monkeyweed21> these dudes fucked up bad
[3:11:16] <%Deadpal> @NeroInfinite they used up all the resources and moved everythign to the stranger.
[3:11:16] <%DrTomT18> wait what?
[3:11:16] <Ben_Lunaris> Clip out of world to break the rules of space and time rbzLul
[3:11:17] <EternalJedi> Bug Report: falling out of world in loading screen LuL
[3:11:20] <cheapdoc> @cobalt_phoenix_ Woolie would get to the end of it by accident
[3:11:20] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the signal from the eye is basically "holy shit this is from the center of the universe and OLDER then the universe?!?!"
[3:11:21] <%Deadpal> :O
[3:11:22] <%WeLucklessJacks> @harmless_toast Thank you!
[3:11:22] <nomos42> could've just watered
[3:11:25] <+extantCadence> @Pequod1 I mean, of course it's a loading screen, the fact that you can do stuff with it is the wild part
[3:11:26] <%DrTomT18> what
[3:11:37] <+tomdwarf> fair, thats alright
[3:11:37] <nomos42> fair
[3:11:37] <captain_kirkhammer> They're not justified, they coulda fuggin sent a scout before destroying their world
[3:11:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ HE WOULD
[3:11:41] <%Frost_Quill> @whyskeywolfe You jump off in the "loading screen" between locations in the raft.
[3:11:41] <+JustToWatch> Woolie would have figured this out in 20 minutes completely accidentally
[3:11:49] <EternalJedi> was that all of the slides in that area?
[3:11:50] <ZE_Count> Okay pat repeat the three secrets!
[3:11:56] <+Lightning_Goat> It's a loading screen recognized in-universe as a loading screen, complete with its own bugs
[3:11:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Making a dyson sphere when planets are as small as in this game must be damn hard huh
[3:11:58] <%Dakuu75> So, what's the goal of this game? What's the "end game"?
[3:11:58] <%DrTomT18> @coffeeabomination Long story.
[3:11:59] <ZE_Count> do you know them by heart?
[3:12:00] <+Lightning_Goat> This DLC fucking rules
[3:12:00] <%Deadpal> @JustToWatch fucking bullll shit lol
[3:12:02] <nomos42> @EternalJedi yes
[3:12:03] <+tomdwarf> Well, the fact thats its a loading screen in universe, and there are bugs involved, is wild
[3:12:03] <not_twitter_rowan> @captain_kirkhammer how? They have to travel between solar systems
[3:12:06] <2midgetsinacoat> Funny thing is that the secrets you learn are quite easy to just stumble upon
[3:12:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Pequod1 dumb devs didn't think to restrict actions while moving, how'd this make it past qa
[3:12:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> @captain_kirkhammer there was no way they could have made it otherwise, these planets are small as hell
[3:12:15] <Joltiness> "Sent a scout" We have no idea about the distance between places.
[3:12:21] <Ben_Lunaris> Canon speedrun tech rbzEZ
[3:12:24] <+BloodyBurney> i feel like woolie would accidentaly discover this stuff through QA powers
[3:12:24] <leole11> my dude is going to noclip reality
[3:12:26] <CrematedCube> Well, imagine if we on Earth suddenly got a pinpoint signal from space
[3:12:40] <CrematedCube> What absurd shit would we do to find it?
[3:12:41] <ne0bunny> glitching out of world as an actual game mechanic is pretty wild
[3:12:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @leole11 it's just a simulation, so really it's like any other game
[3:12:53] <%derpy_platypus> the bugs are features?! Todd Howard sprinting to studio right now
[3:12:56] <harmless_toast> "recall the three virtual rules" hmm, sounds familiar...
[3:12:59] <Joltiness> We wouldn't do much absurd shit, actually.
[3:13:03] <%Spazerbeams> you have everything pat I believe in you
[3:13:05] <%Monkeyweed21> WE GONNA FALL OUT OF WORLD
[3:13:14] <Joltiness> We can barely do shit to fix our own planet.
[3:13:16] <%Valdorick> Oh wait LUL that means the water plane ITSELF is a kill zone, NOT THE AERA BELOW IT
[3:13:18] <harmless_toast> It's not a bug, it's a feature!
[3:13:19] <$dalmek> "was that an intentional bug or what?"
[3:13:20] <$ringabal> For the devs, or the Owls?
[3:13:21] <+blaze__drag> you're a nightmare to test
[3:13:22] <%DrTomT18> Basically, the Owls destroyed their own home planet to find the Eye of the Universe and when they found out what the Eye actually was, they were very pissed off
[3:13:23] <%bassoontyphoon> I believe pat you got this
[3:13:24] <%Faustgesicht> Like IRL or in-game?
[3:13:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL imagine the "bugs" not working
[3:13:28] <cheapdoc> A nightmare or a treasure
[3:13:29] <aeonicVector> Which one, the virtual world, the game, or both
[3:13:29] <%baka_sugoi> God mode active?
[3:13:32] <EternalJedi> how long did it take the owls to QA test this? LuL
[3:13:37] <Kamayanna> Are you talking about the game or about their simulation :V
[3:13:37] <NeroInfinite> "Is this a bug or intentional?"
[3:13:42] <%G_Thunders> The base game must have been 10x worse
[3:13:46] <ZE_Count> the game in the game
[3:13:52] <harmless_toast> @NeroInfinite yes
[3:13:53] <%dasmause> artifact pat
[3:13:57] <nomos42> wait
[3:13:57] <%Buzzard42> the trick has to be to design the dark world with the glitches baked in, but finding ways to aggressively discourage the player from finding them
[3:13:57] <Ben_Lunaris> Only the greatest of Eldritch beings can fall out of world on purpose TPFufun
[3:13:58] <%Deadpal> artifact on the table behind you
[3:14:02] <$ringabal> Well no wonder the Owls burned the damn church
[3:14:02] <ZE_Count> aartifact right ther eon the table
[3:14:04] <Explodincatz> every time
[3:14:04] <+blaze__drag> artifact is right there
[3:14:07] <RyuuAoi> We are doing absurd shit to colonize Mars, si I think we'd go fir it.
[3:14:09] <%Valdorick> wait you don't?
[3:14:11] <%DrTomT18> Pat you need it to go to sleep
[3:14:13] <stoatacious> wut?
[3:14:14] <%Buzzard42> like you've gotta work HARD to make sure players don't abandon their lamp
[3:14:18] <+blaze__drag> its literally the one thing you need
[3:14:19] <RoughBoulder22> shh, no more infos, he has what he needs, just connecting it left
[3:14:22] <Kamayanna> The base game took like over a decade to develop and I think they had the base planet mechanics set up right at the start so like... that's a whole lotta QA
[3:14:29] <%Deadpal> silence chat
[3:14:31] <stoatacious> pat.
[3:14:32] <harmless_toast> oh i think I know what he's doing, this should be fun LUL
[3:14:42] <%Deadpal> harmless oh.
[3:14:47] <%Valdorick> Oh good, that one.
[3:14:47] <%Deadpal> oh.
[3:14:51] <%Deadpal> he just wanted this one?
[3:14:52] <+extantCadence> @Buzzard42 That's what the crushing pitch darkness is for
[3:14:55] <harmless_toast> oh, he just wanted to go further out of his way to get o ne...
[3:14:56] <CrematedCube> I didn't even realize the lantern could be dropped
[3:14:56] <+Lightning_Goat> Time to open the vault
[3:15:01] <+blaze__drag> there was one right next to the entrance of the shortcut
[3:15:09] <%Deadpal> ANYWAYS
[3:15:11] <%Deadpal> yeah
[3:15:14] <leole11> i thought dropping the lantern was unironically a bug
[3:15:28] <%Valdorick> Game lined up next week
[3:15:28] <stoatacious> ooooohh
[3:15:30] <%Buzzard42> @Buzzard42 Oh for sure, but imagine the QA testing in which that got dialed up more and more
[3:15:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> gasp
[3:15:34] <$dalmek> oh nice
[3:15:34] <%Deadpal> ????

[3:17:59] <nomos42> could've held onto the lantern
[3:17:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> almost
[3:18:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can keep the lantern
[3:18:04] <+ApexWalrus> LUL
[3:18:06] <%Like51bears> yes
[3:18:06] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yes
[3:18:07] <Ben_Lunaris> or not ResidentSleeper
[3:18:07] <$ringabal> He didn't believe hard enough
[3:18:07] <bippityjones> You can take the lantern
[3:18:08] <leole11> yes
[3:18:08] <%Deadpal> yeah.
[3:18:08] <harmless_toast> you don't have your spacesuit/jetpack and there are no bodies of water on timber hearth so you can't swim
[3:18:12] <%Buzzard42> you need the lantern yeah
[3:18:15] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt keep the artifact lol
[3:18:17] <%Deadpal> SO CLOSE.
[3:18:19] <home2_u> it's easier with the lantern since it lets you hear
[3:18:26] <leole11> it'
[3:18:28] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, remember, matrix code is just a vision thing, any feature/mechanic still exists.
[3:18:28] <leole11> it's right there
[3:18:28] <+blaze__drag> you can learn the loading zone bug before the debug mode so yeah
[3:18:31] <2midgetsinacoat> @harmless_toast there's plenty of water
[3:18:34] <+extantCadence> I actually don't know why you thought you needed to ditch the lantern
[3:18:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait does the lantern you dropped persist or reset? guess we'll see
[3:18:55] <CrematedCube> I hear people beat this without knowing the Matrix trick
[3:18:58] <foxenco> @extantCadence maybe he thought it would turn off
[3:19:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aw it resets
[3:19:01] <%derpy_platypus> got try everything
[3:19:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CrematedCube literally how
[3:19:11] <harmless_toast> @extantCadence yeah, super hot water deep underground. try jumping into one of those geysers without your suit on and se what happens ;)
[3:19:17] <RoughBoulder22> it's likely because you know water puts it out, lots of people put it down first time cause ofthat
[3:19:22] <+TombstoneTTromboners> once you're in the void
[3:19:23] <buhbuhboat> nah cause you can learn this before the code thing
[3:19:24] <Radioactivetaco9> @CrematedCube thast near impossible you would have to randomly guess a code with like 100s of possibilities
[3:19:25] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you're good
[3:19:39] <+TombstoneTTromboners> look at that

[3:27:01] <thetntm> it only works if you hold the artifact
[3:27:02] <Ben_Lunaris> He'll figure it out in like 4 hours
[3:27:03] <harmless_toast> why would you put down the artifact?
[3:27:03] <%derpy_platypus> hold lamp
[3:27:03] <leole11> you were RIGHT there
[3:27:03] <RoughBoulder22> chat's grabbing the steering wheel and slamming the gas pedal to the floor at this point
[3:27:03] <baavetti> why you drop the lantern
[3:27:04] <ZE_Count> why would you drop the latern?
[3:27:04] <2midgetsinacoat> *drops lamp in your path*
[3:27:04] <AzureSkyKnight> Do you remember?
[3:27:04] <+Yamchadassist> hold the thing man
[3:27:04] <home2_u> No lantern.
[3:27:05] <AoiRob> pat hold it
[3:27:06] <%MrUnKnownAlien> lantern in hand
[3:27:07] <stoatacious> hello darkness my old friend
[3:27:09] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE ARTIFACT
[3:27:10] <Treasure_Vault> You put down your magical artifact
[3:27:11] <buhbuhboat> hold the lantern dummy
[3:27:12] <AoiRob> FUCKING HOLD IT
[3:27:12] <vVAstrAVv> dumbass
[3:27:13] <NeroInfinite> you dropped it LMAO
[3:27:15] <raikagelord1> Think Chat think, are you really helping or are you making things more confused?
[3:27:15] <%MrUnKnownAlien> lol
[3:27:16] <+punit216> That was half smart
[3:27:17] <%Axellogic> GOT MORE TIME NOW
[3:27:17] <%Spazerbeams> you got it this time buddy
[3:27:19] <aeonicVector> LUL
[3:27:21] <nomos42> Now you can do a clean run at least
[3:27:22] <Ben_Lunaris> rbzLul
[3:27:25] <cheapdoc> Won't you get stuck in the simulation tho?
[3:27:30] <%Monkeyweed21> Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
[3:27:32] <+Lightning_Goat> Slide showed a guy putting a dying owl's hand on the lantern
[3:27:32] <%Agami23> i would make the mistake too pat
[3:27:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[3:27:43] <Explodincatz> u would have SOOO cheated
[3:27:43] <nomos42> nah you would've
[3:27:45] <kingra> LUL
[3:27:46] <akitanito> pat needs chat
[3:27:46] <%cvp5127> hooray for backseating
[3:27:49] <%Valdorick> I would have killed myeslf the second I saw the slide showing someone dying... wait what does this say about me?
[3:27:51] <$ArcanumArcanum> that's a woolie-tier assumption
[3:27:52] <foxenco> LUL
[3:27:52] <RoughBoulder22> you would have re-checked the logs
[3:27:52] <CrematedCube> At least it's fast to return there
[3:27:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Dark Side Pat
[3:27:56] <kingra> Understandable
[3:27:58] <cheapdoc> Now you have more time
[3:28:00] <@Ranryu692> and I helped!
[3:28:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you would've
[3:28:03] <harmless_toast> but why would you put it down? you never did that any of the other times you connected
[3:28:05] <%RayReborne> the way to program it without people discovering it and sequemce breaking the game
[3:28:05] <%Faustgesicht> anniesMentor2
[3:28:06] <tanarath> Noooo, you needed to check the logs
[3:28:07] <stoatacious> I never figured out going to sleep WITH the artifact, had to look it up
[3:28:07] <%JoshManVGH> You would have. But the Stream Tax has been paid.
[3:28:08] <leole11> should've BLJ :(
[3:28:11] <%athuramn> backseating won? they're on the board?
[3:28:12] <2midgetsinacoat> In the main game I used the final Nomai control panel incorrectly and got stuck
[3:28:17] <%tank7013> @cheapdoc Only until he wakes up. Then the loop will trigger
[3:28:20] <RoughBoulder22> @Valdorick that you can follow the logic given by the game?
[3:28:30] <Ben_Lunaris> @PatStaresAt If you never give up, you can't ever lose SeemsGood
[3:28:31] <%Valdorick> True!
[3:28:35] <%TarikBot> This game and figuring out the secret tricks to ancient advanced tech reminds me a lot of atlantis the lost empire, and kida trying everything except the 1 right combo of things
[3:28:38] <+punit216> Wait if you connect while dead does that mean the owls can't disconnect you ?
[3:28:41] <+TombstoneTTromboners> smdh could've skipped all this bullshit if you just BLJ'd through the vault lock
[3:28:44] <%walternatorz> what's crazy is you're basically speed running now
[3:28:46] <%derpy_platypus> took me forever to get the last one
[3:28:49] <+blaze__drag> it's like they designed it that way
[3:28:50] <+BloodyBurney> if this is the final puzzle it is masterful
[3:28:50] <cheapdoc> @tank7013 I don't think I understand, but I'll believe it
[3:28:51] <+tomdwarf> Well, one thing I love about this game in general is that, because your in a time loop, the game has to be "completable" in 20 minutes.
[3:28:53] <ThDark> Genius devs, how can they have such large brains?
[3:28:57] <+upandadam> i thought the final run would involve doing high stakes rafting, how naive
[3:29:00] <+extantCadence> It's almost like they planned for this one to be the most convenient
[3:29:01] <foxenco> @punit216 they can and you die
[3:29:04] <+blaze__drag> you're almost halfway through the DLC now
[3:29:18] <harmless_toast> @punit216 if your flame in the dream world goes out you still get booted, back to your dead body....
[3:29:19] <%RayReborne> If you didnt have to hold it, this wouldnt have worked tbh
[3:29:19] <+TombstoneTTromboners> 22
[3:29:21] <%walternatorz> I'm interested to see how speed running can break this
[3:29:22] <%DrTomT18> 22
[3:29:23] <RoughBoulder22> literal speedrun at this point
[3:29:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> guess i'll die
[3:29:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> WE'RE GOIN IN BOYS
[3:29:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> extra crispy
[3:29:30] <%JonathLP> Wake me up
[3:29:33] <%JonathLP> Can't wake up
[3:29:38] <%Valdorick> You're dead
[3:29:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yes
[3:29:39] <+Lightning_Goat> Yup!
[3:29:40] <leole11> you die
[3:29:40] <cheapdoc> I can't believe you almost got that by accident as well
[3:29:40] <iosephe> Yes
[3:29:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> i assume so
[3:29:41] <MartyFun11> Yes
[3:29:41] <$ArcanumArcanum> loop would reset
[3:29:41] <%sirisvirus> you die
[3:29:42] <baavetti> youd die
[3:29:42] <+punit216> Thanks got it
[3:29:43] <+tomdwarf> I think the reset would go off, yeah
[3:29:43] <%Valdorick> Don't fall in the water either
[3:29:43] <harmless_toast> Ghost in the shell
[3:29:43] <thetntm> yes
[3:29:43] <nomos42> yes
[3:29:44] <%Faustgesicht> death
[3:29:44] <HiveMasterMind> yes
[3:29:44] <$ringabal> That's the idea
[3:29:44] <+redyoshi5> yes
[3:29:44] <CrematedCube> Join the bros
[3:29:44] <ssks123> you would be done for yep
[3:29:45] <kingra> Probably
[3:29:45] <%JonathLP> Probably
[3:29:46] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[3:29:46] <RoughBoulder22> like them, yes
[3:29:47] <%Frost_Quill> probs
[3:29:47] <%Spazerbeams> nothing to wake up to
[3:29:48] <%derpy_platypus> one life run
[3:29:48] <%Monkeyweed21> thats death now
[3:29:49] <+blaze__drag> well technically you're already dead
[3:29:49] <MartyFun11> So don't fall down the water now
[3:29:51] <%coffeeabomination> Well aren't you already dead?
[3:29:51] <ZE_Count> dont die
[3:29:52] <stoatacious> fukn dead
[3:29:53] <%JoshManVGH> Only if you're dead.
[3:29:54] <%walternatorz> it's no longer a cheeky joke at that point
[3:29:55] <Kamayanna> You'll find out when you slip off this invisible bridge
[3:29:55] <+Mondeiya> i actually laughed that killing yourself is owlworld tech
[3:29:55] <+extantCadence> No extra lives this time

[3:32:31] <+tomdwarf> fall out of world, view the matrix code, upload self to the matrix. Amazong.
[3:32:33] <The_hidden_> hmm interesting guess
[3:32:35] <+Lightning_Goat> I like how they had all these safeguards to keep anyone from getting in there, and you were able to bypass their codes by actually glitching the game
[3:32:36] <%Spazerbeams> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:32:37] <lilmac64> I think Technocurse might be my new favorite flavor of curse.

[3:35:57] <leole11> :(
[3:36:02] <+TombstoneTTromboners> and THAT'S why the Nomai found it
[3:36:04] <kingra> KILLED EVERYONE
[3:36:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he set it free
[3:36:06] <%Valdorick> and let Escall catch the signal.
[3:36:07] <%razielhex> whoops, I destroyed the galaxy.  soz
[3:36:07] <+Lightning_Goat> And that's why the Nomai came here...
[3:36:12] <%tank7013> Why though?

[3:36:27] <%Deadpal> cause they wanted the eye to never send out it's signal again.
[3:36:28] <2midgetsinacoat> @razielhex he didn't destroy anything
[3:36:30] <mr_saturday93> in short this guy is the whole reason why thr game started
[3:36:31] <%Agami23> saved reality but doomed their people.
[3:36:37] <Explodincatz> they called me betrayer, but in truth it was I who was betrayed
[3:36:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> because he didn't fear the eye and what it told
[3:36:38] <+blaze__drag> that's why the eye only sent out a short signal...
[3:36:44] <Ben_Lunaris> @PatStaresAt The Eye is Reapers PogChamp

[3:38:57] <maybefalco> this is the fucking best
[3:38:59] <harmless_toast> the prisoner's sacrifice wasn't in vain! It's only because of that short burst that the Nomai came and helped lead us to the Eye!

[3:39:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> now YOU'RE the prisoner
[3:39:45] <akitanito> you're the new prisoner

[3:40:13] <vVAstrAVv> he caught you in his stand
[3:40:14] <%tank7013> So what does he do?
[3:40:15] <%DrTomT18> maybe he is gonna build a translator?
[3:40:16] <HiveMasterMind> he was watching u
[3:40:17] <$dalmek> turn the lights off when you go
[3:40:18] <RoughBoulder22> it can't be turned off now, as the controls are broken
[3:40:22] <not_twitter_rowan> amazing

[3:40:34] <%walternatorz> @walternatorz good point!
[3:40:37] <%Frost_Quill> do we get the translator now?
[3:40:38] <not_twitter_rowan> The Prisoner is just as much a Traveler as everyone else
[3:40:50] <%Deadpal> controller dies?
[3:40:52] <+TombstoneTTromboners> he's at rest now
[3:41:00] <%Deadpal> ;_;
[3:41:00] <haisho> Technocurse strikes again!

[3:42:24] <cheapdoc> Look it up?
[3:42:24] <%RetroCop87> LESGO
[3:42:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do you want us to tell you
[3:42:28] <captain_kirkhammer> It's easy, go to ash twin, get the thing, go to bramble
[3:42:28] <Mr_Rakjo> Battery from ash twins into bramble teleport @PatStaresAt
[3:42:31] <danraven> 4 minutes, ash twin, broken tower
[3:42:32] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt time for some fucking angler fish motherfucker
[3:42:33] <%Valdorick> 12 minutes, right?
[3:42:34] <%Deadpal> yeah. grab the core and get to the ship.
[3:42:34] <RoughBoulder22> ash twin core, bramble, eye
[3:42:35] <thetntm> look through your ship log
[3:42:37] <+blaze__drag> just grab the warp core and then land on the stranger
[3:42:41] <%Deadpal> it's in the twin core?
[3:42:43] <stoatacious> sleep 4 mins
[3:42:43] <KasiCrafter> You JUST said it earlier Pat, lol
[3:42:43] <vVAstrAVv> warp core bramble vessel
[3:42:44] <2midgetsinacoat> The Prisoner did a little bit of trolling with the Nomai
[3:42:46] <+Lightning_Goat> Battery's in Ash Twin Project
[3:42:47] <Tisaric> ATP, Vessel, warp
[3:42:47] <%Deadpal> the tower on ash twin.
[3:42:48] <RoughBoulder22> you'll know how
[3:42:48] <AzureSkyKnight> You remember where the vessel is in bramble?
[3:42:49] <bippityjones> Oh it's easy you just get to the core
[3:42:49] <nomos42> Broken tower
[3:42:53] <$ArcanumArcanum> Dual towers. The busted one. Wait for sandfall to be ontop of you before stepping on the teleport
[3:42:56] <%Maids4lyfe> wasn't the battery in bramble dimension?
[3:42:57] <%Spazerbeams> wait until Ember is directly above the broken tower on ash
[3:42:58] <%athuramn> it's like chats ex-gauge just went off
[3:42:58] <CrematedCube> Broken twin tower on Ash Twin
[3:42:59] <+Lightning_Goat> Might be worth doing a test flight to the Nomai ship to remember the way
[3:43:01] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt the double towers on ash twin
[3:43:03] <Frogwash> On the ash twin, enter the fucked up portal when you're inside the sandfall
[3:43:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> go to ash, wait for twin towers to open, stand in the broken one, go in, get core
[3:43:09] <ZE_Count> wait 6 mins then go to ash
[3:43:10] <maybefalco> LUL
[3:43:11] <%Deadpal> don't worry about that
[3:43:11] <+extantCadence> Get the warp core from the Ash Twin Project by turning it off, tag the vessel in your log so you can see the location
[3:43:13] <%Deadpal> you missed a lot lol
[3:43:16] <$dalmek> don't worry about that
[3:43:17] <Kamayanna> They patched new information in there
[3:43:18] <iosephe> yes but no
[3:43:19] <leole11> lmao
[3:43:19] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt I think that was added in patches since you played
[3:43:20] <%Spazerbeams> they added more to clarify the atp entry
[3:43:20] <%Deadpal> it's fine just get to the eye
[3:43:20] <%RetroCop87> FUCKING what
[3:43:21] <%Valdorick> Its fine, its fine
[3:43:22] <nomos42> nevermind
[3:43:22] <Frogwash> Ooooh, did he not get that thing?
[3:43:22] <thetntm> don't worry about that
[3:43:22] <%Mr_Pylon> they added some more context to earlier puzzles
[3:43:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you're fine
[3:43:24] <%JonathLP> You never finished the game pat
[3:43:25] <not_twitter_rowan> don't worry about it
[3:43:25] <ZE_Count> who cares you got mos tof it
[3:43:25] <Explodincatz> wow u never 100% lol
[3:43:27] <CrematedCube> They patched some stuff for clarity
[3:43:28] <captain_kirkhammer> doesn't matter, you got the end, you got what matters
[3:43:28] <haisho> oh nooooo
[3:43:29] <not_twitter_rowan> patched in info
[3:43:30] <harmless_toast> I think there's a new thing there. They've made a few small changes since you played
[3:43:32] <+JustToWatch> nothing important
[3:43:34] <ZE_Count> wait 6 mins
[3:43:35] <%Monkeyweed21> they added clearer hints in a patch
[3:43:38] <ZE_Count> then go to ash
[3:43:38] <%Valdorick> and then bramble fuck
[3:43:42] <%bassoontyphoon> No worrues
[3:43:44] <thetntm> all the big boxes are the important stuff
[3:43:44] <RiverBirch> Going to Ash and then bramble
[3:43:47] <leole11> ash twin, the twin towers, the one that teleports you downwards
[3:43:49] <+blaze__drag> you need to wait for about 4 minutes and then fly to ash twin
[3:43:49] <foxenco> ASH TWIN -> GO TO TWIN TOWERS -> WAIT TO GET BELOW THE BRIDGE -> GO INTO BUSTED TOWER WHEN EMBER IS ABOVE
[3:43:49] <+upandadam> set a waypoint to the mothership
[3:43:50] <not_twitter_rowan> Ash Twin Twin Towers, get in the busted one when the sand is overhead
[3:43:51] <Estuko> will this be uploaded later?
[3:43:52] <+Lightning_Goat> Ash Twin > Warp Core > Dark Bramble > Vessel
[3:43:54] <RoughBoulder22> you're going to the twin towers
[3:43:54] <%Spazerbeams> broken tower
[3:43:56] <lilmac64> Ash twin, broken towers.
[3:44:00] <stoatacious> ash 4 mins
[3:44:01] <captain_kirkhammer> Ash will jog your memory maybe?
[3:44:03] <%Deadpal> there's a tower on ash twin that's broken. wait for the sand and then hold downto teleport into the core.
[3:44:03] <%dasmause> youre gonna have to wait some
[3:44:08] <%Deadpal> it takes place at 6 minutes
[3:44:09] <nomos42> first go to chet with his drums, sleep by the fire for like 5 mins
[3:44:10] <ZE_Count> wait by fire for 6 mins then go to ash or you just wait there
[3:44:11] <%Spazerbeams> wait until Ember twin is directly above and walk into teleporter
[3:44:12] <%polothegreatest> ill pour one out for owl man psaLiz
[3:44:12] <leole11> you need to wait like 4 minutes
[3:44:16] <+blaze__drag> it feels weird how normal the original planets feel now
[3:44:17] <harmless_toast> watch a speedrun, it only takes 10 minutes
[3:44:19] <RoughBoulder22> it's gonna be like 5-6 minutes
[3:44:19] <cheapdoc> 2 years?
[3:44:23] <captain_kirkhammer> I can't belive this game came out 17 years ago
[3:44:35] <nomos42> go to the north pole of the rocky twin
[3:44:37] <+ferniram> oh, does gabbro say anything new? i think he says stuff about what you encounter in the game normally
[3:44:40] <foxenco> DONT PARK IN THE ECUATOR THO
[3:44:41] <not_twitter_rowan> wait with Chert for a few minutes
[3:44:46] <%JoshManVGH> ASH TWIN -> GO TO TWIN TOWERS -> WAIT TO GET BELOW THE BRIDGE -> GO INTO BUSTED TOWER WHEN EMBER IS ABOVE per @foxenco @patstaresat
[3:44:46] <Oath_Othelio> ass twin
[3:44:47] <%bassoontyphoon> It’s incredible this game came out on the Dreamcast
[3:44:54] <CrematedCube> The new info helps explain the ash tower warp better
[3:44:56] <%Valdorick> Do NOT lose your ship
[3:44:56] <+Lightning_Goat> Find the dual towers, stand in the cove underneath the broken one
[3:44:57] <+blaze__drag> there's a camp on Ember Twin where you can pass 4 minutes
[3:44:58] <thetntm> you have to wait for the towers to come out on ash
[3:44:58] <ZE_Count> wait under the bridge then halfway thru the sand tower go in
[3:45:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't fall in the sun lol
[3:45:03] <%baka_sugoi> CRASH CRASH CRASH
[3:45:07] <Explodincatz> sleep for 4min
[3:45:09] <$ringabal> Too Close
[3:45:11] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it'll be in your ship log
[3:45:11] <thetntm> in the black hole forge
[3:45:11] <stoatacious> RUINED TOWER SAND OVER TOP
[3:45:15] <leole11> in brittle hollow, it's a whole thing, dw
[3:45:19] <nomos42> it's not important, just helps with first time
[3:45:24] <$ringabal> MOON
[3:45:26] <vVAstrAVv> warp towers. how do they work
[3:45:27] <%Spazerbeams> you don't need it
[3:45:27] <%Deadpal> this'll take about 5 minutes.
[3:45:29] <iosephe> Yes
[3:45:29] <CrematedCube> Not important, it's just easier for new players
[3:45:29] <thetntm> yep
[3:45:30] <%Deadpal> just wait here pat
[3:45:31] <%VHGS> yes. Don't worry about it
[3:45:32] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's in your ship log too since you did this before
[3:45:34] <tanarath> YES
[3:45:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you're fine
[3:45:37] <ZE_Count> also dont land your ship in the middle of sand tower
[3:45:38] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[3:45:40] <leole11> yes, just don't be in the equator
[3:45:42] <thetntm> go to the campfire and wait a bit
[3:45:42] <stoatacious> YES
[3:45:43] <%VHGS> Yeah just hang out for a couple minutes
[3:45:43] <+blaze__drag> it is but you have to go to Brittle Hollow, activate it, then go back here and teleport in
[3:45:48] <MyNameIsRasus> YES
[3:45:49] <CrematedCube> It's a technicality
[3:45:51] <bosssbatttle> gotta wait for the sand to go down
[3:45:55] <%Spazerbeams> don't land your ship on the equator
[3:45:59] <ZE_Count> now you have to wait 5 mins
[3:46:00] <$ArcanumArcanum> gonna be waiting a few minutes for the towers to be revealed
[3:46:08] <+JustToWatch> you actually have 5 minutes to kill first
[3:46:15] <+extantCadence> Well, the way you're supposed to get to the Black Hole Forge is through a warp tower on Ash Twin
[3:46:16] <+Lightning_Goat> Once you get the core, turn on the Distress Signal frequency on your signalscope to find the Nomai shuttle
[3:46:19] <MyNameIsRasus> don't lqnd there
[3:46:27] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Go to Chert on the other twin and sleep for 5 minutes
[3:46:29] <nomos42> can talk about your thoughts on the dlc for a few mins i gueess
[3:46:33] <RoughBoulder22> first tower to appear is sun, second towers is the ash twins
[3:46:33] <leole11> tag the vessel
[3:46:40] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you can also just mark it in your ship logg
[3:46:44] <MyNameIsRasus> by there i meant the equator
[3:46:44] <%Mr_Pylon> You can just tag the Vessel
[3:46:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the nomai vessel
[3:46:45] <%Like51bears> you can just tag the vessel
[3:46:49] <+upandadam> could also do a map from the rumors yeah
[3:46:50] <thetntm> you don't need the signal just mark the vessel
[3:46:50] <$dalmek> @PatStaresAt you can mark the vessel directly
[3:46:51] <teebos> you can also just mark the vessel
[3:46:52] <stoatacious> hey pat what do you think about the dlc?
[3:46:52] <%Deadpal> and reminder there's 2 timnes the angler fish are in the dark bramble.
[3:46:53] <leole11> mark the vessel like you would the stranger
[3:46:53] <harmless_toast> @PatStaresAt you can also set the vessel as a destination in the log, like you did with the stranger
[3:46:54] <waltzqueen> tag the Vessel
[3:46:56] <%Spazerbeams> you can tag the vessel on your ships log, it's way easier
[3:46:57] <+extantCadence> Tag the vessel in the ship log, it's much easier than the distress signal
[3:46:58] <%Deadpal> OH YEEAH YOU CAN JUST TAG THE VESSEL.
[3:47:00] <%Deadpal> god.
[3:47:03] <MyNameIsRasus> tag the vessel is good idea
[3:47:05] <%Deadpal> it's in the red.
[3:47:07] <+TombstoneTTromboners> bottom left
[3:47:08] <+Lightning_Goat> Vessel's lower left
[3:47:09] <%Valdorick> does anyone remember the Dark Bramble pathway?
[3:47:09] <leole11> red, down
[3:47:09] <RoughBoulder22> big red
[3:47:10] <ZE_Count> bottom left
[3:47:22] <AoiRob> red
[3:47:27] <%Deadpal> val you gotta follow the signal
[3:47:28] <%Spazerbeams> don't forget the fish
[3:47:28] <nomos42> and then you just have to not get eaten
[3:47:29] <waltzqueen> @Valdorick not off hand
[3:47:33] <%Deadpal> the hardest part is the fucking Anglerfish.
[3:47:34] <harmless_toast> @Valdorick that's what marking it tells us
[3:47:35] <thetntm> look at the code in the ship log
[3:47:36] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yes
[3:47:38] <%Deadpal> just coast.
[3:47:39] <%Spazerbeams> don't move
[3:47:41] <thetntm> don't move at all
[3:47:42] <%DrTomT18> yes
[3:47:42] <%SovPho> Don't make sound
[3:47:42] <DukeBlack_> YEAH
[3:47:43] <bosssbatttle> yes
[3:47:43] <leole11> don't boost near them
[3:47:44] <%Deadpal> and then wait for about 300 meters.
[3:47:44] <iidentity_> The fish is don't move at all
[3:47:44] <%SveriSageAdvice> yes
[3:47:45] <leole11> yes
[3:47:45] <%Mr_Pylon> coast on through
[3:47:45] <waltzqueen> Coasting! no noise
[3:47:45] <+Lightning_Goat> Fish are blind, don't move and don't run into them
[3:47:46] <+Nahual_Amini> no sound
[3:47:46] <ZE_Count> yeah 1 pip
[3:47:46] <RoughBoulder22> correct, coast
[3:47:46] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[3:47:47] <%derpy_platypus> barely touch stick to move
[3:47:47] <nomos42> don't make a sound
[3:47:47] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt dont make noise, dont use thrusters much
[3:47:47] <%Frost_Quill> Don't make sound.
[3:47:48] <ssks123> only use the momentum and the air thrusters
[3:47:48] <aeonicVector> either low momentum or FULL SPEED
[3:47:49] <AzureSkyKnight> just coast
[3:47:49] <danraven> don't move after entering the red part
[3:47:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Valdorick go full speed in, don't move after that
[3:47:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> just vibe
[3:47:50] <aeonicVector> no inbetween
[3:47:52] <MyNameIsRasus> don't thrust
[3:47:52] <%SovPho> You can turn and stuff but thrusters make sound
[3:47:53] <MartyFun11> Only one level of thrust is allowed
[3:47:54] <%VHGS> with analog you can tap it VERY lightly, but you don't need to
[3:47:55] <not_twitter_rowan> don't make sound at all just coast
[3:47:57] <%Deadpal> ...
[3:47:57] <leole11> you can technically boost under 1 pip of strength, but it's super finicky
[3:47:59] <%Deadpal> you're ON ASH TWIN.
[3:48:02] <%Deadpal> you gotta wait lol
[3:48:02] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt you'll want to tag the vessel in the ship log as well to make navigation easy
[3:48:02] <RoughBoulder22> DONT MOVE DURING BREATHING
[3:48:03] <AoiRob> storytime with the prisoner made me cri ;-;
[3:48:05] <%Spazerbeams> very very small speed when you are near the eggs
[3:48:06] <+blaze__drag> you have to wait 4 minutes
[3:48:07] <%Dakuu75> wut? lol
[3:48:07] <thetntm> it takes like 5 minutes
[3:48:12] <%dekkitout> Is that a euphemism?
[3:48:12] <tanarath> don't add movement, just coast
[3:48:13] <%Deadpal> @AoiRob same T_T
[3:48:17] <ZE_Count> should waited 6 mins at the fire
[3:48:18] <+Lightning_Goat> Use very light thrusters at the entrance to get yourself past the anglers
[3:48:22] <+blaze__drag> you can sleep at a camp to pass the time
[3:48:23] <+TombstoneTTromboners> that's the sun station
[3:48:24] <nomos42> @Tisaric he did
[3:48:24] <Explodincatz> go sleep for 3min
[3:48:24] <%DrTomT18> I can't fucking get over that last slide reel
[3:48:24] <leole11> that's sun
[3:48:25] <vVAstrAVv> i just hit the eject button. gets me past the fish every time
[3:48:26] <%Deadpal> the prisoner was stuck there for a LONG LONG TIME.
[3:48:29] <iidentity_> What I do during the fish part is I fuckin GUN IT into the last warp seed so that i can float by very fast
[3:48:32] <%bassoontyphoon> Give this planet the succ
[3:48:38] <Ben_Lunaris> Give it the suck TPFufun
[3:48:40] <%Deadpal> THE PRISONER WAS STUCK IN THAT ROOM FROM BEFORE YOUR SPECIES EVOLVED.
[3:48:46] <thetntm> pat what are you doing
[3:48:47] <nomos42> that's the sun station tower
[3:48:53] <foxenco> follow the sand tube
[3:48:56] <+TombstoneTTromboners> literally hundreds of thousands of year
[3:49:04] <leole11> the owl people predate the nomai
[3:49:05] <%bassoontyphoon> I hope the prisoner is at the fire at the end
[3:49:10] <$ArcanumArcanum> wrong tower
[3:49:10] <iidentity_> @Deadpal ya gotta wonder how time feels in the simulation they locked him in
[3:49:11] <+Lightning_Goat> Wrong tower
[3:49:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dude that prison is torture
[3:49:18] <IHaveNoFunnyName> More than 200,000 years at the very least
[3:49:20] <+Lightning_Goat> You want the pair of towers
[3:49:20] <AngryAsian5> S U C C
[3:49:23] <$dalmek> also neat that we have owl people 2 eyes --> nomai 3 eyes --> hearthians 4 eyes
[3:49:24] <+JustToWatch> he's been in there for like, at LEAST 2 weeks
[3:49:26] <%VHGS> He probably did a LOT of jerking off
[3:49:26] <vVAstrAVv> they predate nomai by WHO KNOWS how much
[3:49:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> who knows how fast evolution happens in this universe tho, the scale of literally everything is wonky
[3:49:29] <+TombstoneTTromboners> there it is!
[3:49:30] <%Like51bears> THAT ONE
[3:49:30] <leole11> that's the one
[3:49:30] <%Valdorick> Next path should get it
[3:49:32] <%Spazerbeams> broken tower
[3:49:32] <$ArcanumArcanum> you want that busted tower
[3:49:32] <kingra> What is Pat doing now?
[3:49:33] <MyNameIsRasus> you 2ant the double towers
[3:49:39] <%Frost_Quill> these towers
[3:49:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Does that mean their physical bodies died from the ghost matter?
[3:49:41] <thetntm> use the tower that's partially destroyed
[3:49:41] <leole11> it's the busted looking one
[3:49:43] <not_twitter_rowan> BUSTED TOWER
[3:49:43] <+Lightning_Goat> Stand in the broken one
[3:49:44] <$dalmek> yep
[3:49:45] <%Like51bears> Yes
[3:49:45] <$ArcanumArcanum> yes
[3:49:46] <danraven> yep
[3:49:46] <tanarath> he snore
[3:49:47] <%Deadpal> yes
[3:49:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[3:49:48] <iosephe> aye
[3:49:49] <%DrTomT18> yup
[3:49:51] <+JustToWatch> under the bridge
[3:49:53] <%Spazerbeams> they added a little alcove next to the teleporte, stand in there
[3:49:53] <not_twitter_rowan> yea
[3:49:55] <nomos42> yeah, there's a little cubby you can wait in now
[3:49:55] <%Dakuu75> is that moon or w/e pulling dust off this place via gravity?
[3:49:55] <%Deadpal> remember to wait for the sand and jetpack DOWN into the teleport point.
[3:49:55] <%MrUnKnownAlien> there
[3:49:56] <+extantCadence> Lower floor
[3:49:57] <+Lightning_Goat> There's a small awning next to the portal in the bottom of the room
[3:49:58] <%Deadpal> it's BELOW this pat
[3:49:59] <%TarikBot> gonna get sucked
[3:50:00] <+TombstoneTTromboners> so yeah for this, wait under the bridge then when the sand tower is right over head, go into the warp pad of the broken tower
[3:50:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait in the side room until sand is on top of you
[3:50:01] <thetntm> you have to be on the floor underneath
[3:50:01] <%Like51bears> use the closet in the bottom so you dont get sucked up
[3:50:02] <bippityjones> go lower
[3:50:03] <leole11> you need to be lower, you'll get sucked
[3:50:04] <IHaveNoFunnyName> @Monkeyweed21 Their physical bodies died from old age or malnutrition
[3:50:06] <+Lightning_Goat> ye
[3:50:07] <AoiRob> ye
[3:50:08] <MyNameIsRasus> lower floor
[3:50:09] <harmless_toast> zoeyNail
[3:50:10] <nomos42> so you don't get succed
[3:50:10] <foxenco> YOU DONT HAVE TO LOOK UP
[3:50:12] <+extantCadence> You need to hide in the alcove so you don't get sucked up by Ember Twin
[3:50:12] <%Spazerbeams> stand in the alcove
[3:50:13] <%MrUnKnownAlien> broken tower and time it
[3:50:13] <%Deadpal> yeah you gotta wait in the underhang for a second or 2
[3:50:14] <+Mondeiya> stand in the alcove or the sand will suck u
[3:50:14] <leole11> also, BOOST DOWNWARDS
[3:50:14] <Explodincatz> the alcove was always there
[3:50:15] <+Lightning_Goat> Portal should be uncovered here in a minute
[3:50:15] <thetntm> don't stand under you'll get sucked up
[3:50:16] <CrematedCube> I'd place a probe on it and wait for the warp window to open
[3:50:16] <%Deadpal> don't wait on the pad.
[3:50:18] <$dalmek> @PatStaresAt you can put your scout on the warp pad to activate it, if you don't wanna fiddle with jetpacking
[3:50:19] <vVAstrAVv> dont get sucd
[3:50:20] <+TombstoneTTromboners> don't get sucked
[3:50:20] <%Like51bears> Use the closet
[3:50:23] <+Lightning_Goat> Make sure you don't get sucked by the sand
[3:50:24] <bippityjones> don't get succed, hide in the back
[3:50:25] <%Mr_Pylon> stand outside under the awning until the sand passes overhead, then boost DOWN
[3:50:25] <+chadwicktouchdown> you just need something to stop ascent
[3:50:27] <$ArcanumArcanum> @Deadpal you dont have to jetpack down. Just wait for the sand to be ontop of you then walk out onto it from the alcove
[3:50:27] <%Deadpal> don't get succed up.
[3:50:28] <ZE_Count> just remember to stay under the bridge until the sand halfway thru or you get sucked up
[3:50:38] <+Lightning_Goat> Stand under the awning that opens up and run in when Ember is overhead
[3:50:38] <%Deadpal> there's a hidehole that shows up.
[3:50:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the sand tower will pull you
[3:50:39] <nomos42> you're earlu
[3:50:40] <+Mondeiya> wait for the sand to go down
[3:50:40] <%Spazerbeams> wait until it drains and you will see it
[3:50:40] <foxenco> UNDER THE BRIDGE
[3:50:40] <vVAstrAVv> watch out. devs moved a cactus
[3:50:43] <nomos42> early
[3:50:44] <leole11> wait for the alcove to show up, hide in the alcove, then boost down
[3:50:45] <+JustToWatch> sand pillar will suck you up
[3:50:46] <thetntm> you DO NOT want to get succ'd
[3:50:48] <%Like51bears> THERE
[3:50:48] <+chadwicktouchdown> sand sucks you up, you need something to stop your ascent
[3:50:48] <Explodincatz> Pat is so gunna fail this
[3:50:48] <$ArcanumArcanum> yeah hide there
[3:50:49] <stoatacious> sand pulls you
[3:50:49] <teebos> sand flies over when you need to teleport
[3:50:49] <+TombstoneTTromboners> hide there
[3:50:50] <%Deadpal> there ya go
[3:50:52] <nomos42> there
[3:50:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> stay in there
[3:50:52] <%Deadpal> now WAIT.
[3:50:53] <MyNameIsRasus> pause
[3:50:53] <%Like51bears> PERFECT
[3:50:55] <+blaze__drag> hide there
[3:50:56] <iosephe> The sand tornado's suck is larger than the alignment cone
[3:50:56] <%Spazerbeams> they added this little alcove in a patch
[3:50:56] <+TombstoneTTromboners> then run in when sand is going up
[3:50:57] <%Frost_Quill> They added this I think.
[3:50:58] <CrematedCube> They did tweak this place slightly since you played
[3:50:59] <+blaze__drag> enter when ember is overhead
[3:51:01] <%Valdorick> Aw, that means you never get their translation.
[3:51:01] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt portal activates when its inside the sand column and it tries to suck you off the planet
[3:51:02] <%Deadpal> do not go until the pad is COMPLETELY revealed
[3:51:02] <+Lightning_Goat> The sand will succ you, run in when it's straight overhead
[3:51:02] <ZE_Count> did they add that?
[3:51:04] <%Deadpal> NO
[3:51:04] <$ArcanumArcanum> no
[3:51:04] <+TombstoneTTromboners> no
[3:51:05] <%VHGS> Either way

[3:52:04] <teebos> late
[3:52:05] <captain_kirkhammer> It has to be *during* the sand pillar
[3:52:05] <CrematedCube> Too late!
[3:52:05] <%Deadpal> you have to wait until the sand
[3:52:05] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU FOOL
[3:52:06] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[3:52:07] <%MrUnKnownAlien> nowe
[3:52:07] <+extantCadence> Alright time to wait another 4 minutes or so
[3:52:08] <+TombstoneTTromboners> BECAUSE THE SAND WILL SUCK YOU UP
[3:52:08] <%DrTomT18> ...
[3:52:08] <DukeBlack_> cuz chat isdumb
[3:52:10] <+Lightning_Goat> The portal only activates when the planet is directly overhead
[3:52:10] <%Deadpal> it'll pull you up too quilckly.
[3:52:10] <leole11> you get sucked up
[3:52:10] <%dasmause> cause itll suck you off
[3:52:11] <%Spazerbeams> it will suck you up
[3:52:11] <stoatacious> MISSED IT
[3:52:12] <MartyFun11> Cause the sand pillar will suck you out
[3:52:13] <ZE_Count> EYE OF HURRRICANE
[3:52:13] <iosephe> Because you would be sucked up before you teleport
[3:52:15] <captain_kirkhammer> Becsaue you'll get sucked up
[3:52:15] <Kosinkadink> It would suck you up, you ahve to run into it while sand is overhead
[3:52:15] <%bassoontyphoon> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[3:52:15] <%VHGS> because the sand SUCC pulls you off of the panel so you don't warp
[3:52:15] <%TarikBot> look down youre teleporting into the centre of the planet youre on
[3:52:16] <%DrTomT18> reset
[3:52:16] <$ArcanumArcanum> If you were standing there you would get sucked off before teleporting.
[3:52:16] <+blaze__drag> the sand pulls you off if you stand on it
[3:52:16] <Kamayanna> You enter the eye of the storm
[3:52:16] <%JonathLP> just wait
[3:52:16] <HiveMasterMind> you get sucked up to soon
[3:52:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> because itll suck you out of the way
[3:52:17] <leole11> you need to run in, boosting down
[3:52:18] <$ringabal> YOU'RE ASKING ME!?!?!?
[3:52:20] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt because the pillar will suck you up
[3:52:20] <%Valdorick> The FRONT of the pillar will suck, you have to run in during the middle part of the pillar
[3:52:20] <%Deadpal> you have to wait for the sand to be overhead
[3:52:21] <%Spazerbeams> you didn't
[3:52:21] <+Mondeiya> cuz the sand would literally pull you up before
[3:52:22] <CrematedCube> It'll suck you upward before it procs
[3:52:22] <stoatacious> you'll get sucked off
[3:52:22] <+chadwicktouchdown> you need to go into the sand at the perfect moment
[3:52:23] <harmless_toast> @PatStaresAt You have to be on it in the MIDDLE of the sand stream. The front edge will drag you up too early if you just stand there
[3:52:23] <IHaveNoFunnyName> YOU GET PULLED UP
[3:52:23] <captain_kirkhammer> You did not
[3:52:23] <danraven> because it would suck you up before you're able to warp
[3:52:24] <not_twitter_rowan> YOU GET PULLED UP BEFORE YOU TELEPORT
[3:52:25] <ZE_Count> no you didnt
[3:52:25] <leole11> i promise you, you didn't
[3:52:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @PatStaresAt you gotta wait until the sand is vertical at 90 degrees, but before that it will suck you up and you miss it
[3:52:26] <%Frost_Quill> you wouldn't teleport apparently
[3:52:27] <%bassoontyphoon> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[3:52:29] <%topendbuzza> you get sucked up before it goes
[3:52:29] <RoughBoulder22> go when its at the max or it'll pull you out
[3:52:30] <nomos42> you get sucked up
[3:52:31] <MyNameIsRasus> you'll get succed with the sand
[3:52:33] <AoiRob> DO IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SAND CROSSING
[3:52:33] <lilmac64> Last time, you bumblefucked backwards onto the platform.
[3:52:34] <stoatacious> you get sucked off too early
[3:52:35] <tanarath> run during the sand pillar. you got super lucky last time
[3:52:35] <thetntm> try it
[3:52:35] <$ArcanumArcanum> you still have time
[3:52:36] <+extantCadence> If you just stand on the plate, you get succed by the sand
[3:52:36] <%Like51bears> YOU'LL END UP ON THE SUN IF YOU DO THAT
[3:52:40] <%Spazerbeams> you still can
[3:52:41] <harmless_toast> @PatStaresAt you can still do it this loop!
[3:52:42] <thetntm> YOU STLIL HAVE TIME
[3:52:43] <$ringabal> ??????????????
[3:52:43] <leole11> 100% you can
[3:52:43] <%Deadpal> you had time but it's okay
[3:52:44] <Kamayanna> If you get lucky you get sucked up, bounce off the pillar, and bounce back down to the pad, but that's a crapshoot
[3:52:45] <leole11> you have so much time
[3:52:45] <nomos42> you need to jump in just as the sand comes over
[3:52:45] <vVAstrAVv> just fucking watch your old stream rq
[3:52:45] <+tomdwarf> You can do it on second pass
[3:52:45] <$dalmek> practice getting in first and then reset?
[3:52:46] <captain_kirkhammer> It might honestly be faster to die and then sleep at a fire
[3:52:47] <+upandadam> yes you will there's tons of time
[3:52:47] <stoatacious> just wait
[3:52:47] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you can
[3:52:48] <$ArcanumArcanum> Pat you still have time
[3:52:48] <%Monkeyweed21> YES YOU CAN
[3:52:48] <+extantCadence> You'll have time either way
[3:52:49] <+BloodyBurney> you have a lot of time
[3:52:49] <%DrTomT18> reset
[3:52:50] <cheapdoc> Might as well die and try again
[3:52:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you have time still
[3:52:53] <lilmac64> Bruh
[3:52:54] <stoatacious> pat.
[3:52:54] <RoughBoulder22> PLENTY OF TIME?
[3:52:55] <+hoenhime344> restart
[3:52:55] <Kosinkadink> @Like51bears no he wont, incorrect
[3:52:55] <waltzqueen> Reset?
[3:52:55] <iosephe> Yes you can
[3:52:56] <bippityjones> You can you have time
[3:52:56] <%Mr_Pylon> You totally have time
[3:52:56] <foxenco> YOU CAN
[3:52:57] <+extantCadence> Second pass is plenty of time
[3:53:00] <bippityjones> wait for the second round
[3:53:02] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU HAVE 15 MINUTES
[3:53:02] <%bassoontyphoon> You still have timeeee
[3:53:03] <thetntm> PAT
[3:53:05] <%MrUnKnownAlien> u have lots of time
[3:53:05] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you'll have plenty of time
[3:53:06] <+Lightning_Goat> Might not have enough time on this cycle to do it
[3:53:06] <leole11> you have SO much time
[3:53:07] <bippityjones> TONS of time
[3:53:16] <vVAstrAVv> can we get a baby mode for teleporting mobius?
[3:53:16] <+blaze__drag> the nomai really fucked up ash twin didn't they
[3:53:18] <MyNameIsRasus> MEGA TIME
[3:53:19] <+TombstoneTTromboners> if you miss it again, you won't
[3:53:24] <%Like51bears> @Like51bears oh shut up you nitpicker
[3:53:26] <%TarikBot> stand on the pad and look down
[3:53:27] <+upandadam> wow they even gave you a little closet
[3:53:27] <%Deadpal> Remember to hold L2 to get onto the pad.
[3:53:28] <%polothegreatest> psa1guy
[3:53:31] <$ringabal> On the diamond, Pat
[3:53:31] <+JustToWatch> now wait in the cubby until the pillar is DIRECTLY overhead
[3:53:32] <$ArcanumArcanum> Wait for the sand to start blasting for 2 secs then walk forward
[3:53:33] <nomos42> 1. wait in hole 2. sand comes along 3. jump in portal
[3:53:36] <%Spazerbeams> once the sand shows up directly overhead, thrust down and walk into the pad
[3:53:39] <CrematedCube> If you place a probe it'll be easy to see
[3:53:39] <waltzqueen> @PatStaresAt throw a scout on the landing pad, jump on when the scout dissapears
[3:53:40] <%Deadpal> yeah you have to be boosting down.
[3:53:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @blaze__drag i don't think there was too much to begin with
[3:53:50] <+Lightning_Goat> The sand pillar will suck you up before the portal activates if you just stand on it
[3:53:51] <harmless_toast> @PatStaresAt it will only warp you in the MIDDLE of the sand stream. If you just stand on the pad the front edge will drag you up before it can warp you
[3:53:52] <%Deadpal> stay under the alcove, wait for sand and then go down
[3:53:52] <vVAstrAVv> run when the sand is centered
[3:53:58] <%Frost_Quill> Boost down and walk into the sand???
[3:54:03] <Kosinkadink> @Like51bears unless you mean that the sand will drag him there, I thought oyu meant this portal takes him to the sun station
[3:54:04] <%Monkeyweed21> remember you have to look up
[3:54:06] <RoughBoulder22> @PatStaresAt if you think standing there is fine then do it, chat is literally driving you like a car LUL

[3:56:31] <%polothegreatest> LUL

[3:56:51] <bippityjones> fuck
[3:56:52] <%Fooguwu> Tuning in for 5 seconds just to see what's going on. I'm glad I've decided to play this for myself XD

[3:56:54] <Oath_Othelio> LOL
[3:56:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:56:55] <%polothegreatest> QA PAT psaDab
[3:56:59] <leole11> it was not up
[3:57:00] <RoughBoulder22> rest 4 mijnutes to save time
[3:57:00] <+blaze__drag> one guy
[3:57:00] <stoatacious> FUUUUUUUU
[3:57:00] <%twoto858> Welp
[3:57:04] <+TombstoneTTromboners> do it pat
[3:57:06] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you'll see
[3:57:07] <Zalapski> good job chat
[3:57:11] <KasiCrafter> That doesn't make sense. The warps should work once the planets align again, no?
[3:57:11] <leole11> i promise that won't work
[3:57:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok pat do it your way
[3:57:12] <%dasmause> @PatStaresAt then youll get yeeted into ember twin
[3:57:12] <%RetroCop87> pAT gWUMPY
[3:57:13] <%Frost_Quill> and boost down when the sand comes
[3:57:14] <%Valdorick> Rest at bonfire for... some time.
[3:57:15] <foxenco> rest 4 minutes
[3:57:15] <%bassoontyphoon> OMG psa1guy
[3:57:17] <stoatacious> you can't stand on pad
[3:57:17] <+blaze__drag> we're so good at this game
[3:57:18] <iosephe> Rest for like, 3 minutes
[3:57:18] <ZE_Count> wait 6 mins at fire first tho
[3:57:19] <CrematedCube> I do that every time, but that shit also does happen
[3:57:23] <Oath_Othelio> I thought for a second that meditating with it in their had was about to game over it
[3:57:23] <ZE_Count> rest 5 por 6 mins
[3:57:24] <cheapdoc> Maybe you shouldn't listen to chat, 'cause we are stupid idiots
[3:57:25] <Ben_Lunaris> That's what you get for listening to chat rbzLul
[3:57:25] <AoiRob> the sand will suck you just run for it in the middle
[3:57:25] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn
[3:57:25] <vVAstrAVv> lets just watch the ending on YouTube
[3:57:26] <+blaze__drag> sleep for 4 minutes at the start
[3:57:26] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Do it
[3:57:29] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Prove chat wrong
[3:57:30] <Explodincatz> do it or no balls
[3:57:30] <@Spydurman> but then what would we do?
[3:57:34] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Catharsis is great
[3:57:35] <captain_kirkhammer> That won't woirk unless they patched the sand pillar to be less forceful
[3:57:35] <ZE_Count> the rest thign really made this way better
[3:57:35] <MyNameIsRasus> wait like 4 minutes
[3:57:35] <%G_Thunders> If standing on the pad worked people wouldn’t hate that puzzle
[3:57:36] <nomos42> @KasiCrafter the return warp doesn't need alighment
[3:57:43] <+RobotCo_Op> 47 raiders from RobotCo_Op have joined! 
[3:57:45] <%Deadpal> I'm trying!
[3:57:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cheapdoc normally i'd agree, but not this time
[3:57:48] <harmless_toast> this is what you get for trusting chat
[3:57:49] <cizal11> Maybe just stare at the ships log until you remember how the game works again
[3:57:50] <%Deadpal> T_T
[3:57:53] <Ben_Lunaris> PogChamp
[3:57:56] <%SaiyanShoto> Do it no balls, punch us all
[3:57:57] <+Ghostbuster216> TombRaid TombRaid TombRaid TombRaid robotc2Rco robotc2Cog robotc2Corps
[3:57:58] <+TombstoneTTromboners> we're gonna get to punch YOU in the dick soon
[3:57:59] <harmless_toast> watch a speedrun, it will only take 10 minutes to watch
[3:58:00] <%RayReborne> ONE GUY STRIKES AGAIN
[3:58:01] <%polothegreatest> RAID LETS GOOOO psaDab
[3:58:04] <maybefalco> so does that equal half a dick punch?
[3:58:07] <Kosinkadink> @KasiCrafter I think they are designed so that the white pad only sends you back once you get sent there with the black pad, regardless of orientation
[3:58:11] <mr_saturday93> What if that's my kink pat? Punch my dick!
[3:58:15] <%bassoontyphoon> Not my dick D:
[3:58:20] <+extantCadence> @KasiCrafter No, only the initial teleport from the alignment does that. The return teleport uses residual charge or whatever in canon.
[3:58:23] <akitanito> just meditate
[3:58:28] <KasiCrafter> So wouldn't there be another Black Hole bad to send you OUT, then?
[3:58:32] <stoatacious> CBT FUCK YEAH
[3:58:33] <KasiCrafter> *pad
[3:58:34] <%Fooguwu> u can punch me in the dick pat i can take it
[3:58:34] <Ben_Lunaris> Pat is in the process of screwing up TPFufun
[3:58:34] <%athuramn> AHHH ONE GUY, YOU DASTARDLY DEVIL
[3:58:47] <%RetroCop87> AngriestPat did this in one run, what's your excuse.
[3:58:49] <tanarath> THIS GAME LIVES AND DIES ON SPOILERS, SO DON'T WATCH IF YOU DON'T WANT IT RUINED
[3:58:52] <%Agami23> i just realized, pat hasent played since self got added i dont think
[3:58:55] <%SaiyanShoto> You wanna punch us all in the dick you're gonna have to jump to reach first Kappa
[3:59:01] <+Ghostbuster216> @Greetings from @robotco_op—who just made Partner! TombRaid robotc2Rco robotc2Corps
[3:59:04] <CrematedCube> I'll take the dick-punch myself for being the OneGuy, rest assured
[3:59:15] <%Valdorick> wait... what this an angriestpat game?
[3:59:17] <%Valdorick> was*
[3:59:23] <%razielhex> bonk
[3:59:25] <%Fooguwu> I see pat is as good at landings as ever
[3:59:26] <%bassoontyphoon> @saiyanshoto is your dick that small that he’ll have to jump?
[3:59:27] <danraven> bonk
[3:59:31] <tanarath> big damage
[3:59:38] <AngryAsian5> Nailed it
[3:59:44] <%Mr_Pylon> @KasiCrafter Nah, using a black hole pad charges the white hole with a return warp. White holes don't warp on their own.
[3:59:45] <tanarath> repaor!
[3:59:45] <RoughBoulder22> that might get sucked up
[3:59:49] <Ben_Lunaris> Mind Goblins creeping in WutFace
[3:59:53] <%SaiyanShoto> @bassoontyphoon Of course!
[3:59:55] <+extantCadence> They added the ability to enter the project's black hole at the end of the loop and the result is excellent
[4:00:09] <harmless_toast> it's nice getting to actually use the ship agaian
[4:00:09] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.

[4:00:38] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Game over over
[4:00:38] <not_twitter_rowan> you fucking die
[4:00:38] <+blaze__drag> game over
[4:00:38] <%JonathLP> true death
[4:00:38] <%tank7013> An alt ending
[4:00:39] <nomos42> reload save
[4:00:39] <cureneckbeard> You can restart, right?
[4:00:40] <%VHGS> It doesn't delete your save or anything
[4:00:40] <MyNameIsRasus> game over
[4:00:40] <+blaze__drag> deletes your save
[4:00:40] <CrematedCube> Several game over options
[4:00:41] <%Maids4lyfe> you die
[4:00:42] <%Valdorick> However... you can die... IN ANOTHER WAY.
[4:00:42] <aeonicVector> Bunch of minor endings like that
[4:00:42] <%Mr_Pylon> Final death
[4:00:43] <%Agami23> theres checkpoints i think
[4:00:44] <%polothegreatest> YEEEAAAAHHH
[4:00:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> anyway stand on that pad pat
[4:00:47] <%bassoontyphoon> Actual game over
[4:00:49] <iosephe> Nope
[4:00:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> there is something you can do in there to cause a time paradox
[4:00:50] <%DrTomT18> you can get a special ending if you pull it out and go to the Stranger
[4:00:50] <%Valdorick> It doesn't.
[4:00:52] <$dalmek> no, you load last save
[4:00:52] <harmless_toast> there are several hidden alternate endings. The DLC added a few more
[4:00:53] <not_twitter_rowan> you can reload save but it's a bummer
[4:00:53] <HiveMasterMind> bring the black hole machine to the stranger
[4:00:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> basically just loop but your info on your last loop isn't saved
[4:00:55] <%twoto858> Nah
[4:00:55] <Kamayanna> In my opinion it should wipe your save but I can understand why they didn't go that far
[4:00:55] <%Like51bears> Fun fact, if you pull out the core and die on the flame in the new dlc you get a unique game over
[4:00:56] <+BloodyBurney> not like a deleted save matters
[4:00:56] <not_twitter_rowan> it SHOULD
[4:00:57] <%Frost_Quill> No, they were cowards about it.
[4:00:57] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it does not, fortunately
[4:00:59] <+blaze__drag> deletes System 32
[4:00:59] <%RetroCop87> it didn't delete your save when you created a time paradox
[4:01:00] <%sirisvirus> it deletes you
[4:01:01] <%twoto858> They're not that insane
[4:01:01] <leole11> no, it just dumps you on the main menu after credits
[4:01:01] <%topendbuzza> I mean you still know what YOU know
[4:01:02] <+TombstoneTTromboners> but it would be funny if it did
[4:01:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> I prefer when you shatter time
[4:01:03] <teebos> nah goes to last loop
[4:01:04] <lilmac64> The devs break into your house and kick you in the jaw
[4:01:04] <danraven> nah just rolls the credits and puts you back to the menu
[4:01:07] <%RetroCop87> you arleady did that
[4:01:07] <%razielhex> PIME TERADOX
[4:01:09] <kingra> You meet yourself
[4:01:09] <Ben_Lunaris> Then you die, Black Hole's are powerful TPFufun
[4:01:11] <harmless_toast> the time paradox is in the base game
[4:01:11] <%Logoth_> Snake you cant do that. The future will be changed
[4:01:13] <thetntm> you cant talk to anoter version of yourself
[4:01:16] <@Ranryu692> fuck your grandma
[4:01:18] <cureneckbeard> I think if you die-die you can just start over from the last loop
[4:01:19] <%dekkitout> Don't pull a Fry
[4:01:20] <%Deadpal> jump in the black hole in the ash twin project at 22 minutes
[4:01:20] <%Valdorick> They added it after you beat it.
[4:01:21] <CrematedCube> I'd mess with time after this run, for funsies
[4:01:22] <ingman112> Jump into the hole during the supernova
[4:01:22] <%Faustgesicht> Duplicate your probe
[4:01:25] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Jump in in one loop then dont the next
[4:01:27] <aeonicVector> I can answer if you WAnt ME TO
[4:01:28] <%topendbuzza> ignore us pat
[4:01:30] <%dekkitout> @Ranryu692 tajWHY
[4:01:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hop in core black hole when loop ends, then go back next loop and don't do it
[4:01:31] <Explodincatz> are u SURE u have beaten this before?
[4:01:31] <%Mr_Pylon> Project creates a black hole in the centre at the end, you can go through that
[4:01:31] <+Lightning_Goat> If you remove the core and jump into the black hole as the sun goes supernova
[4:01:35] <+tomdwarf> You leave a time clone inside the lab.
[4:01:37] <+blaze__drag> when the loop ends, it makes a black hold to send the data through, you can physically enter that black hole
[4:01:37] <%TarikBot> If you wait the whole 22 minutes and float up to the warp core as it sends info back in time it sends one of you back too
[4:01:38] <Saltmeisterr> you did that pat
[4:01:40] <$ArcanumArcanum> open the shield and wait til the end of the loop
[4:01:41] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> you did it
[4:01:42] <%razielhex> the same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time @PatStaresAt ; TimeCop rules.
[4:01:43] <mr_saturday93> didn't you do that before?
[4:01:43] <harmless_toast> if you go into the black hole in the center of the ATP, you get sent back 22 minutes and your next self can meet you
[4:01:45] <leole11> the core creates a black hole when the supernova hits
[4:01:46] <vVAstrAVv> yeah when the supernova starts you fly through the black hole in atp
[4:01:47] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 lol
[4:01:48] <%Fooguwu> OH! Cuz the power would be boosted just like in the lab! that's wild
[4:01:51] <%DrTomT18> you can have a very interesting converstaion with your self
[4:01:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt if you take it to the Nomai girl on the quantum Moon, you get stranded with her forever
[4:01:53] <%DrTomT18> or scream a lot
[4:01:54] <reonome> you did that already pat
[4:01:58] <%Piemen99> It was the double probe thing
[4:01:59] <+TombstoneTTromboners> woo!
[4:02:01] <HiveMasterMind> white hole is created 22 minutes in the past & shoots out future you at the start of the loop
[4:02:04] <%Agami23> its pretty funny. happened to vinny as he beat the game.
[4:02:05] <harmless_toast> zoeyNail
[4:02:06] <$dalmek> nice
[4:02:10] <+extantCadence> @Lightning_Goat You don't remove the core, you just open the shell thing surrounding it so you can get in
[4:02:10] <+Lightning_Goat> There's special endings for removing the core and going to The Stranger as well
[4:02:12] <CrematedCube> It'll mess up the endgame with time paradoxes tho
[4:02:12] <%Deadpal> okay good
[4:02:14] <Ben_Lunaris> You kill yourself to cause a paradox to meet yourself so you can save yourself from yourself rbzEZ
[4:02:14] <ZE_Count> learning d aloop
[4:02:19] <%Deadpal> now just do the same thing and get to dark bramble.
[4:02:37] <harmless_toast> @CrematedCube they fixed that bug
[4:02:38] <+Lightning_Goat> @Lightning_Goat Yeah I realized the error right as I posted it whoops
[4:02:47] <+extantCadence> @Agami23 Yeah, that was so good. In the middle of walking across the Eye and reality just breaks.
[4:02:53] <nomos42> you can just warp out now
[4:03:02] <masterfire23> what is this? some kinda deathloop?
[4:03:04] <%Deadpal> gravity isn't necessary
[4:03:05] <leole11> it's a ring lmao
[4:03:17] <+blaze__drag> gravity is for chumps
[4:03:18] <%athuramn> an elden ring
[4:03:19] <RoughBoulder22> @masterfire23 you're gonna get spoilers
[4:03:22] <%Deadpal> playing b-bop all aorund the school?
[4:03:26] <%Deadpal> with kids who were doing no good?
[4:03:28] <%Valdorick> Gonna need to live with your aunty and your uncle in the eye?
[4:03:32] <+blaze__drag> oh hey the ash twin project is like a mini stranger now that I think about it
[4:03:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> all this zero g is turning me into will smith
[4:03:34] <%Deadpal> TO DARK BRAMBLE!
[4:03:34] <not_twitter_rowan> Mark the Nomai vessel on the ship log to head right there
[4:03:34] <@QueequegTheater> Hey so, how do I get into the secret room in the DLC tower?
[4:03:38] <CrematedCube> @harmless_toast Oh very good, I know people who got their endgame interrupted by it
[4:03:38] <The_hidden_> in Predestination he has a sex change and time travels to fuck himself and his himself as a baby
[4:03:40] <leole11> the cool song
[4:03:40] <%Mr_Pylon> Mark the Vessel
[4:03:40] <nomos42> epic music time
[4:03:45] <waltzqueen> @PatStaresAt Mark the Vessel!
[4:03:46] <$ArcanumArcanum> don't die in dark bramble now :)
[4:03:46] <%Mr_Pylon> Yay
[4:03:47] <Explodincatz> here it is
[4:03:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's TIME

[4:04:00] <%Deadpal> oh god don't die.
[4:04:02] <+blaze__drag> now is a great time to fly into the sun
[4:04:08] <RoughBoulder22> @QueequegTheater you want an actual answer on that or?
[4:04:10] <+evestrogen> Love the final loop music PrideGasp
[4:04:11] <ingman112> The remixed version, yeah
[4:04:13] <aeonicVector> well ofc, dont die btw :)
[4:04:13] <$dalmek> a really cool version of it too
[4:04:14] <%JonathLP> because if you die, it is the final end
[4:04:17] <%Monkeyweed21> they play the full version
[4:04:18] <%dekkitout> Godspeed doofus
[4:04:19] <haisho> now don't fuck up
[4:04:22] <cureneckbeard> @masterfire23 Outer Wilds is a puzzle-type game where you are an alien archaeologist exploring his solar system. Don't watch if you want to play, it is very weak to spoilers
[4:04:22] <+tomdwarf> Cause if you fail, thats it.
[4:04:24] <@QueequegTheater> @RoughBoulder22 Yes, I was stuck for three hours yesterday
[4:04:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> how does it feel to end the loop, again?
[4:04:28] <+SmartAssPawn089> Prahlow is pretty intelligent with his theming
[4:04:32] <%Monkeyweed21> look at the stars
[4:04:34] <%Frost_Quill> They SHOULD delete your save file if you fuck this up and I'm sad they don't.
[4:04:35] <@QueequegTheater> @RoughBoulder22 How turn off lights
[4:04:37] <%RetroCop87> the no fog mod for Dark Bramble is terrifying
[4:04:39] <Ben_Lunaris> Destroy the Black Hole for the true final ending PunOko
[4:04:40] <+blaze__drag> spoilers are supereffective against this game
[4:04:41] <RoughBoulder22> lower entrance if I'm thinking of the correct tower
[4:04:44] <+extantCadence> Remember, it's the red light when there's 2 signals, and the big pack of anglerfish is just inside there
[4:04:46] <%tank7013> You can see starts exploding in the back
[4:04:50] <RoughBoulder22> ah, that one
[4:04:53] <%tank7013> stars*
[4:04:54] <+TombstoneTTromboners> how much ya'll wanna bet pat gets eaten by an angler fish
[4:04:55] <%razielhex> Godspeed You!  Traveller Herthian.
[4:04:55] <+blaze__drag> this game has a x4 type weakness to spoilers
[4:04:57] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK UP THE COORDINATES
[4:04:58] <@QueequegTheater> @RoughBoulder22 DM me
[4:04:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RetroCop87 why because you see the fish or what
[4:04:59] <$ringabal> oh boy
[4:05:00] <+TombstoneTTromboners> go for the red
[4:05:03] <Explodincatz> Pat is so gunna die to the fish
[4:05:04] <Oath_Othelio> @Frost_Quill All that would do is delete your log, you  wont forget your knowledge which is what counts
[4:05:07] <harmless_toast> The RED one BloodTrail

[4:05:09] <+blaze__drag> it's the red one

[4:06:14] <%Mr_Pylon> Anglerfish!!!!
[4:06:14] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Accelerate a ton and then stop, they can only hear your engine
[4:06:15] <+TombstoneTTromboners> "and that's how the universe ended"
[4:06:16] <+Lightning_Goat> Gotta give your engines a bit more moxie next time
[4:06:16] <AngryAsian5> That's the game
[4:06:18] <Explodincatz> fucking called it
[4:06:19] <+Pequod1> Just gotta float through that last portal, gun it for a hot second then kill the engine
[4:06:19] <leole11> good luck pat!
[4:06:20] <MyNameIsRasus> There's a fish
[4:06:20] <+extantCadence> That happened to me when I did it too
[4:06:20] <Yuroshi> best ending
[4:06:20] <%alcors_wisdom> ah fuck caps lock
[4:06:20] <harmless_toast> @tanarath why would that matter? They're blind
[4:06:23] <doggieo> just regular dead
[4:06:29] <CrematedCube> A test flight might be a good idea
[4:06:29] <+blaze__drag> and that is how the universe ended
[4:06:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you remember the coordinates for the eye @PatStaresAt
[4:06:32] <lilmac64> Either go SUPER slow, or blast through full speed. Not committing in either way will get you killed.
[4:06:33] <haisho> does this mean we have to do the Stranger sequence again?
[4:06:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @PatStaresAt it's not about speed it's about sound from engine
[4:06:40] <Ben_Lunaris> Play the Souls death sound rbzLul
[4:06:41] <+blaze__drag> not with a bang, but with a "Oh fuck god damn anglerfish"
[4:06:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Thrust in the first room, don't in the second
[4:06:47] <cizal11> Maybe go see the path to the vessel first
[4:06:48] <%Deadpal> it shows up on your screen for you
[4:06:49] <nomos42> I tried the artifact on this fire, nothing happend but I got a trophy lol
[4:06:49] <MartyFun11> The coordinates show up on the screen
[4:06:50] <not_twitter_rowan> @haisho no, we met him already
[4:06:50] <leole11> they give it to you, on your HUD
[4:06:50] <captain_kirkhammer> The game gives you them
[4:06:50] <+blaze__drag> it pops up
[4:06:53] <%Valdorick> Told to you by the UI
[4:06:54] <+Lightning_Goat> The coordinates should be in your ship log
[4:06:55] <teebos> they show up on your screen
[4:06:55] <tanarath> @harmless_toast I thought it could attract them, but you're right
[4:06:57] <thetntm> they do not
[4:06:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @haisho no that was a few loops back
[4:06:58] <aeonicVector> yeah either NO speed or FULL speed, half and half kills you
[4:07:00] <+23Carrot> They'll pop up when you get there
[4:07:01] <%drabberfaun535> why doesn't turning off the nomi machine stop the universe death?
[4:07:04] <harmless_toast> sideways L, folding table, wonky N
[4:07:06] <thetntm> they are in your ship log
[4:07:19] <thetntm> unless they added that in a later patch
[4:07:21] <captain_kirkhammer> @drabberfaun535 No, why would it
[4:07:23] <+blaze__drag> @drabberfaun535 cause it's not causing the universe's death
[4:07:25] <cureneckbeard> crazy talk activate
[4:07:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @drabberfaun535 nomai machine isn't what's causing it. the universe is naturally dying of old age.
[4:07:28] <%Frost_Quill> @drabberfaun535 Because [spoilers].
[4:07:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @drabberfaun535 because it's not causing it
[4:07:29] <+extantCadence> @drabberfaun535 The Nomai machine isn't killing the universe?
[4:07:34] <MyNameIsRasus> @drabberfaun535 because this game takes place AT the death of the universe
[4:07:35] <Explodincatz> use your scout next time
[4:07:35] <$dalmek> @drabberfaun535 the universe dying is just normal. It's just happening because of time
[4:07:36] <+BloodyBurney> watch this all be for, like, a cool jpeg
[4:07:36] <%polothegreatest> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[4:07:37] <leole11> @drabberfaun535 the nomai machine is not causing the universe's death, the universe is dying because it's too old
[4:07:39] <harmless_toast> @drabberfaun535 the strangers have nothing to do with the stars going super nova
[4:07:44] <+Lightning_Goat> @drabberfaun535 You're stuck in a time loop by the Nomai, getting to the Eye of the Universe is the final goal and requires the power core that powers the time loop
[4:07:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @drabberfaun535 no all it does is send info back in time 22 minutes
[4:07:53] <danraven> oh is that the quantum moon
[4:07:59] <%bassoontyphoon> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand psaCrazy psaMenace
[4:08:00] <+blaze__drag> if you fuck up again you could go say hi to Solanum on the moon
[4:08:01] <waltzqueen> @extantCadence heat death. the machine is just going off because of the star's natural life cycle
[4:08:16] <CrematedCube> The Nomai made the time loop, but the supernova is all-natural
[4:08:27] <%dasmause> another happy landing
[4:08:27] <%Fooguwu> Also, never fully press anything that engages the engine. Gently press into it, or else ANGORY FISH @PatStaresAt
[4:08:31] <%razielhex> @drabberfaun535 right, it's just the natural heat death of their galaxy.  The Herthians are the last species to discover space travel, hundreds of billions of years too late for it to matter.
[4:08:34] <waltzqueen> Don't park on Equator!
[4:08:37] <%Deadpal> the supernova powers the time loop.
[4:08:40] <thetntm> @blaze__drag he laread ysaw her in this save so it's fine
[4:08:45] <@QueequegTheater> Yet Kappa
[4:08:46] <%Valdorick> "The Sun Station doesn't work. Will NEVER work. We can not explode a star."
[4:08:56] <captain_kirkhammer> In the Bramble you can fie the engine one pip's worth without waking the anglers
[4:09:11] <+blaze__drag> never hurts to say hi to her again
[4:09:16] <cheapdoc> They did nothing right
[4:09:34] <not_twitter_rowan> The owl-deer are space elves, the Nomai are space dwarves
[4:09:36] <Ben_Lunaris> Blow up the black hole, that'll create an alternate reality where you won't be stuck in a timeloop, trust me I know this shit TPFufun
[4:09:36] <+SmartAssPawn089> Fear of death vs Love of Life to the extremes
[4:09:38] <%topendbuzza> yeyeye
[4:09:38] <$ArcanumArcanum> @captain_kirkhammer You have to stay below 1 pip. If you light up a pip you alert them
[4:09:41] <aeonicVector> Ya know, i kinda wish the staff trade let you read their notes
[4:09:42] <%Monkeyweed21> the Nomai did nothing wrong tho
[4:09:44] <thetntm> there were nomai opposed to it for that reason
[4:09:45] <FleshFriend> anything for SCIENCE
[4:09:45] <nomos42> but pat! time ethics
[4:09:46] <%polothegreatest> thats religion i guess
[4:09:48] <%Fooguwu> they may have gone too far in a few places. though, it's the end of the universe or close to it
[4:09:50] <+Lightning_Goat> They knew the machine worked, they just didn't have the power to make it work as well as they wanted
[4:09:50] <%Mr_Pylon> They also don't believe that ethics exist in a loop
[4:09:51] <MyNameIsRasus> The Nomai would have been right if they could blow the star up tho
[4:09:51] <%Agami23> for science, we have to blow up the sun!
[4:09:52] <tanarath> Pat, it's timeloop logic, though
[4:09:53] <%Valdorick> They did quantum physics and time travel right.
[4:09:53] <thetntm> and they did a ton of testing before hand
[4:09:54] <%drabberfaun535> is it because of the eye of universe's effect on them?
[4:09:55] <%DrTomT18> They must have passe that trait onto the Hearthians
[4:09:55] <MartyFun11> To be honest, they already tested it and found out time travel is possible
[4:09:56] <RoughBoulder22> on the other hand, the owls tried to live forever
[4:09:56] <%TarikBot> TIME ETHICS
[4:09:56] <+blaze__drag> the nomai are ballsy as fuck
[4:10:00] <%Monkeyweed21> time ethics make that fine
[4:10:05] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt you just talked about time ethics a while ago
[4:10:06] <%dekkitout> I mean what else are they gonna do, pull an asteroid out of orbit to kill them Kappa
[4:10:09] <captain_kirkhammer> @captain_kirkhammer I did it just yesterday at one pip, maybe they changed it
[4:10:10] <not_twitter_rowan> The Nomai knew it worked
[4:10:11] <%TarikBot> If murder is ok in a time loop so is supernovas
[4:10:12] <%tank7013> They weren't even trying to test the time machine. They just wanted to see if they could blow up a star
[4:10:13] <%Agami23> i like the fish people. they just want to explore and find out stuff
[4:10:19] <not_twitter_rowan> they just hadn't done it on that scale
[4:10:19] <samsara_vt> leftovers from a nomadic society where they could just leave i guess
[4:10:31] <CrematedCube> The Hearthians are out playing Kerbal while the Nomai were playing Dyson Sphere
[4:10:36] <lilmac64> "If it works, we'll get a signal from the future telling us so." "Have we received any such signal?" "Shut up"
[4:10:41] <thetntm> @tank7013 that's not true. the sun station was the last thing the nomai built and they built it specifically to power the ash twin
[4:10:46] <+extantCadence> The Nomai sunk cost fallacied themselves all the way to the point that they tried to blow up a star
[4:10:57] <%Valdorick> They even had it set up so the sun station's doomsday device would shut down when the probe canon found the eye.
[4:10:59] <+blaze__drag> the gravity is actually weaker here than on the stranger
[4:11:05] <MyNameIsRasus> And then the Nomai fucking died
[4:11:14] <MartyFun11> They only started building the sun station when they discovered time travel
[4:11:15] <vVAstrAVv> gravitys so fucking strong... the gravity: 1.1
[4:11:16] <tanarath> crazy goats
[4:11:27] <thetntm> when you're on the sun station you can even see "oh hey there's a cool comet let's check out that" right after they test the sun station
[4:11:33] <%jtdobyns> SO why are we redoing the ending? what does the DLC have to do with this? dont we need to open the bell thing on the stranger?
[4:11:36] <%tank7013> @thetntm There's a note where they explicitly state the goal of blowing up the sun is to see if it's possible
[4:11:41] <+blaze__drag> and everything the hearthians make is wooden so that's safe
[4:11:44] <not_twitter_rowan> @jtdobyns we did that
[4:11:46] <RoughBoulder22> @jtdobyns shh, watch
[4:11:51] <not_twitter_rowan> arrived late buddy
[4:11:52] <thetntm> @jtdobyns we already opened the bell
[4:11:56] <%derpy_platypus> the sun tho
[4:11:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jtdobyns we did, ending has new stuff bc of it
[4:12:03] <%Valdorick> Oh right, because you DIED, instead of time traveling
[4:12:03] <CrematedCube> To be fair, the Nomai did actually take care with the ecology
[4:12:09] <MyNameIsRasus> into the sun
[4:12:16] <%dasmause> WARP CORE THE SUN
[4:12:21] <%jtdobyns> in the dream sequence we did
[4:12:26] <+blaze__drag> the ultimate yeet
[4:12:34] <not_twitter_rowan> Solanum and The Prisoner are Travelers too
[4:12:42] <%drabberfaun535> I hope the next dlc lets you save the universe
[4:12:54] <+extantCadence> All of this work was to meet your new best friend, Owlboy
[4:12:56] <%tank7013> I swear picking up the warp core accelerates the background stars exploding. Which is cool
[4:12:59] <%Like51bears> they said this was the last one
[4:13:01] <thetntm> @drabberfaun535 that would go against the core themes of the story
[4:13:01] <CrematedCube> Is it me, or is the music being super weird
[4:13:01] <DaCheekyOne> Any interstellar jokes?
[4:13:02] <waltzqueen> @drabberfaun535 they said this will be the only dlc
[4:13:02] <nomos42> I think the lack of written language is cool but does make some parts more confusing
[4:13:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @drabberfaun535 that kinda  goes against the whole message of the game tho
[4:13:07] <%tank7013> Very cinematic
[4:13:09] <%razielhex> that was tight
[4:13:09] <%SovPho> noice
[4:13:11] <MyNameIsRasus> @drabberfaun535 wouldn't that ruin the point of the game?
[4:13:11] <ingman112> Saving the universe defeats the whole point of the game
[4:13:16] <masterfire23> the clip of the first time pat flew into the sun still kills me
[4:13:19] <nomos42> just coast
[4:13:20] <+TombstoneTTromboners> one pip of accelartion is all you need
[4:13:20] <%Agami23> you know, when you think about it isnt your search for knowledge also destroying the universe.
[4:13:22] <$ringabal> Moon says hello
[4:13:24] <+TombstoneTTromboners> GUN IT
[4:13:24] <+extantCadence> Hitting the quantum moon actually would have just stopped you
[4:13:27] <Kamayanna> Stop poofing!!!!
[4:13:29] <%razielhex> hahahaha yesssssssssssss
[4:13:30] <The_hidden_> lol wow
[4:13:30] <FleshFriend> BAHAHAHA
[4:13:30] <AngryAsian5> F
[4:13:30] <Mr_Rakjo> DAMNIT PAT
[4:13:31] <not_twitter_rowan> GUN IT OR COAST PAT
[4:13:31] <thetntm> pat when you hear that just gun it
[4:13:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pat floor it then leave it alone
[4:13:33] <+tomdwarf> No thrust. None of it
[4:13:33] <%SovPho> no thrusts
[4:13:34] <kingra> VORED
[4:13:34] <RoughBoulder22> stop THRUSTING
[4:13:35] <Explodincatz> use scout
[4:13:35] <cheapdoc> Turn off your lights
[4:13:36] <%RayReborne> gun and then kill engine
[4:13:36] <%Valdorick> NotLikeThis
[4:13:36] <$ArcanumArcanum> You went over a pip
[4:13:36] <waltzqueen> @PatStaresAt STOP HITTING THE GAS
[4:13:37] <@Ranryu692> you're too impatient
[4:13:37] <%X2Eliah> Pat, fingerbang the thrusters easier
[4:13:37] <%polothegreatest> HOW
[4:13:38] <iosephe> just coast
[4:13:38] <MartyFun11> You touched it
[4:13:38] <EternalJedi> stop thrusting
[4:13:39] <not_twitter_rowan> STOP POOFING
[4:13:39] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt WHY WERE YOU BOOSTING
[4:13:39] <stoatacious> STOP BOOSTING
[4:13:40] <%RetroCop87> noise and headlights
[4:13:40] <Ben_Lunaris> I'm immortal, what do I care if the universe implodes? TPFufun
[4:13:41] <%Logoth_> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[4:13:41] <+Lightning_Goat> Gotta just drift in
[4:13:43] <leole11> GUN IT
[4:13:44] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> NO THRUST, ZERO
[4:13:44] <+blaze__drag> patience is a virtue
[4:13:44] <stoatacious> 7OU DID THIS FIRST TIME
[4:13:45] <%drabberfaun535> headlights
[4:13:46] <%Frost_Quill> Slow or fast, don't do middle.
[4:13:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you have to burst at the start and then stop
[4:13:46] <captain_kirkhammer> You have to go through the left one first, the the red one
[4:13:46] <not_twitter_rowan> EITHER GUN IT OR COAST
[4:13:48] <DigiLapin> your doing minitrhusts instead of just letting it carry you
[4:13:48] <+Nahual_Amini> There's enough time
[4:13:48] <ne0bunny> pat you cant use your thusters so much
[4:13:48] <thetntm> maximum velocity or NO velocity
[4:13:49] <+TombstoneTTromboners> only ONE pip of acceleration pip
[4:13:49] <RyuuAoi> I screamed
[4:13:49] <%tank7013> Too bad reduced frights doesn't affect these shitheads
[4:13:49] <+extantCadence> GUN IT, COAST, OR GO AROUND THE OUTSIDE
[4:13:50] <DukeBlack_> just drift
[4:13:50] <mr_saturday93> Pat they hear your engine.....
[4:13:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YES YOU WERE
[4:13:51] <+SmartAssPawn089> Oh no.
[4:13:51] <DigiLapin> you move automaticly
[4:13:51] <Kamayanna> Even just rotating sets them off. Use freelook if you need to look around
[4:13:52] <+blaze__drag> 0 thrust
[4:13:53] <lilmac64> Coast or go Pat, Pick one and only one!
[4:13:53] <AoiRob> NO BOOST
[4:13:53] <waltzqueen> yes you were!
[4:13:56] <vVAstrAVv> litterally do nothing
[4:13:56] <stoatacious> YOU WERE
[4:13:57] <aeonicVector> ride your inertia, or gun it from second 0, no inbetweens
[4:13:57] <+23Carrot> The max you can boost is 1 pip
[4:13:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Hoof it on the first room
[4:13:58] <+tomdwarf> You are. Just slowly.
[4:13:58] <tanarath> Pat, gun it, then stop micro-thrustering, they hear prey
[4:13:59] <AoiRob> YOU WERE
[4:13:59] <ne0bunny> it only feels like you arent
[4:14:00] <+blaze__drag> drift into the D dimension
[4:14:00] <mr_saturday93> ENGINE Pat
[4:14:02] <+blaze__drag> put on some eurobeat
[4:14:03] <Zalapski> lights have nothing to do with it, only thrusters trigger fish
[4:14:04] <%RetroCop87> you can ram fish
[4:14:04] <%Deadpal> yeet yourself into the brambole about 1000 meters away :(
[4:14:05] <leole11> @PatStaresAt you can gun the first area, you have to coast the second area
[4:14:06] <%Monkeyweed21> GUN IT AT THE START AND THEN DO NOTHING
[4:14:06] <MyNameIsRasus> may be a better approach
[4:14:06] <AoiRob> TAKE IT SLOW
[4:14:07] <akitanito> final final final run
[4:14:07] <CrematedCube> We could hear your toots
[4:14:08] <ZE_Count> practise flying in space look at the pip screen
[4:14:10] <cizal11> Then go do the run without the warp core
[4:14:10] <doggieo> too much adjusting
[4:14:10] <thetntm> get out of the pilot seat if you have to
[4:14:11] <@GeneralSCPatton> Inertia
[4:14:13] <%TarikBot> If you can see the distance number going down then youre moving
[4:14:15] <%ElkRiverDog> fear da fishie
[4:14:19] <$ArcanumArcanum> Line up and drift
[4:14:20] <enddword> did you see the Arise of the Awakener gameplay?
[4:14:22] <cizal11> Stop pretending you remember how to do it and just learn it again
[4:14:22] <ZE_Count> look at how muhc your uusing you have ti bbelicate
[4:14:23] <+JustToWatch> Take 3
[4:14:24] <+SmartAssPawn089> Dark Bramble plays with perspective, you're still going fast af
[4:14:26] <%Tearonex> Pat doesn't want the game to end LUL
[4:14:29] <nomos42> I think adjusting angle is fine but boosting is not
[4:14:32] <%RetroCop87> Pat you were wrong
[4:14:32] <%Fooguwu> INERTIA IS A PROPERTY OF MATTER. BILL BILL BILL BILL
[4:14:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @PatStaresAt after you enter the bramble, gun it for like 2 seconds then let go, you will keep momentum but no make noise
[4:14:41] <jorniev> aw man i missed this stream, wha happened?
[4:14:45] <ZE_Count> i get around fine with 1 pip
[4:14:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you need to boost right at the start and then do nothing
[4:14:51] <%RayReborne> BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
[4:14:55] <Explodincatz> u might as well pull up a video at this rate
[4:14:56] <jorniev> what new weird shit did he discovered?
[4:15:01] <%derpy_platypus> you got a whole 16 minutes to coast through
[4:15:07] <%CatastropheCorvid> BILL  NYE THE SCIENCE GUY
[4:15:08] <MyNameIsRasus> and then don't boost on the second room
[4:15:09] <%Frost_Quill> @jorniev Lots of stuff.
[4:15:14] <%RetroCop87> there's a mod to remove the fog
[4:15:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jorniev inside dream bell is owl guy that was imprisoned for letting eye signal free, which is how the nomai found it
[4:15:20] <nomos42> I think they added that anglerfish too
[4:15:20] <+swesterly> what is the core gameplay loop of this game exactly?
[4:15:22] <%Fooguwu> SCIENCE RULES
[4:15:29] <Explodincatz> use your scout
[4:15:32] <%RayReborne> SciEnCe RulEz
[4:15:33] <%bassoontyphoon> Remember that turning the ship can also make noise so free look to look around
[4:15:34] <Ben_Lunaris> Just because you look like you aren't moving actually means you're still going mach 2000 rbzLul
[4:15:36] <MyNameIsRasus> @swesterly find shit out
[4:15:40] <%Mattais88> Is it because you messed with the settings to see better in the dream world?
[4:15:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @swesterly explore die repeat
[4:15:41] <thetntm> @swesterly exploration, find new secrets, use secrets to unlock new exploration
[4:15:41] <not_twitter_rowan> @swesterly fly around and explore shit
[4:15:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> @swesterly Literally a gameplay loop.

[4:15:43] <RoughBoulder22> @swesterly you're gonna get endgame spoilers here
[4:15:44] <jorniev> so the owl people are responsible for this bullshit?

[4:16:26] <krackman245> Perfect OhMyDog
[4:16:27] <%razielhex> @PatStaresAt I also loved the movie "Sunshine" by Danny Boyle.  Thanks for the re-enactment.
[4:16:29] <%Fooguwu> Save us, Science Guy
[4:16:30] <+hoenhime344> do it right
[4:16:31] <cizal11> Pat if you can’t even avoid the sun how are you gonna avoid the fish
[4:16:31] <%Mr_Pylon> just a little Sun before the end, as a treat
[4:16:33] <Ben_Lunaris> GlitchLit
[4:16:34] <%RayReborne> "this'll be a piece of cake" Kappa
[4:16:36] <lilmac64> That's the content I come here for.
[4:16:46] <KasiCrafter> Remember, when trapped in something's overwhelming gravitational pull, boost PERPENDICULAR to the pull, NOT away from it
[4:16:49] <%RetroCop87> THE SUN IS LIKE A GIANT ANGLER FISH
[4:16:51] <Ben_Lunaris> Burn baby Burn GlitchLit
[4:16:52] <CrematedCube> Where's that Reduced Frights option when you need it
[4:16:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Fuck NMH this rules
[4:16:55] <%alcors_wisdom> @Mr_Pylon he had to work on his tan
[4:17:01] <%Frost_Quill> The sun is too aggressive, turn down the sun spookiness levels in the menu.
[4:17:06] <%RayReborne> DISCO INFERNO
[4:17:07] <%razielhex> @KasiCrafter basically the sun is a riptide
[4:17:08] <teebos> you can do it!
[4:17:11] <ZE_Count> I believe
[4:17:12] <%walternatorz> is there a babby setting to remove the sun?
[4:17:12] <%Fooguwu> did u know that in space, it takes as much time to stop as it does to accelerate?
[4:17:18] <nomos42> wait can you turn off the anglerfish?
[4:17:18] <%Fooguwu> science fact
[4:17:18] <MyNameIsRasus> Reduced Brights When
[4:17:19] <RoughBoulder22> the sun is a miasma of incandescent plasma
[4:17:20] <%bassoontyphoon> I believe
[4:17:28] <KasiCrafter> That's just what we call an orbit B)
[4:17:32] <%drabberfaun535> did the nomi mask look disappointed to anyone else?
[4:17:34] <+extantCadence> Pat, practice avoiding the sun. If you can dodge something as big as the sun, you must be able to dodge an anglerfish.
[4:17:43] <smoothwood07> you got this, pat
[4:17:45] <%Frost_Quill> @nomos42 We're making fun of the fact that pat made the owl guys easier.
[4:17:56] <$dalmek> forget flat earth. every planet is round but the sun is flat
[4:18:00] <%razielhex> @extantCadence IF YOU CAN DODGE A WRENCH, YOU CAN DODGE A BALL
[4:18:07] <@Ranryu692> @extantCadence if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball
[4:18:09] <jorniev> owl guy released the thing into space?
[4:18:09] <%CatastropheCorvid> @extantCadence If you can dodge a ball of plasma you can dodge a fish!
[4:18:14] <aeonicVector> @Frost_Quill nah, just dabbing on that one guy for ruining spiderman for his son =P
[4:18:17] <+trashmanasam> left for a bit, did pat explode?
[4:18:23] <Ben_Lunaris> @PatStaresAt Use Crazy Talk to say you can't do it so you do it flawlessly this time SeemsGood
[4:18:26] <%Valdorick> You mean... Perpendicular?
[4:18:39] <%bassoontyphoon> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[4:18:48] <%Fooguwu> im glad i can enjoy the stream for a while with no spoilers due to pat's fish allergy
[4:19:10] <jorniev> dman
[4:19:14] <jorniev> EARTH?
[4:19:14] <%razielhex> can't spell Hearthian without Earthian
[4:19:17] <kingra> Earth is dead :(
[4:19:21] <%Mr_Pylon> Also in some of the slides you can see a pre-bramble planet
[4:19:21] <mr_saturday93> earth?
[4:19:24] <waltzqueen> EARF
[4:19:25] <captain_kirkhammer> We did, there are easter eggs
[4:19:26] <aeonicVector> TFW earth never learned how to do a space BibleThump
[4:19:30] <%X2Eliah> Priority: Erf
[4:19:30] <%dekkitout> The Great Filter is no joke
[4:19:32] <thetntm> wait really
[4:19:33] <%RealThiele> filtered hell yeah
[4:19:39] <+trashmanasam> probs got killed way earlier lets be honest @PatStaresAt
[4:19:42] <+Pequod1> I mean the universe reset so there was no avoiding that for earth really
[4:19:45] <%Agami23> the fish people made a spaceship out of wood and were trying to use metal.
[4:19:46] <%Maids4lyfe> what if earth made interloper
[4:19:48] <KasiCrafter> The Nomai created time travel with nothing but Escape Pod parts and grit
[4:19:49] <shotgang86> yeah, thanks trump
[4:19:54] <jorniev> SHOULD HAVE USED WOOD FOR OUR SPACE SHIPS
[4:19:54] <$ringabal> Those Earthlings sure are a contentious peoples.
[4:20:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> "Yes the planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders."
[4:20:04] <Saltmeisterr> etf happened to dark bramble?
[4:20:07] <HiveMasterMind> So what is the Bramble anyway just a dimensional weed?
[4:20:15] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt With only a population of about 20-100 our nuclear wars were much more devestating in the Outer Wilds universe.
[4:20:18] <%razielhex> @trashmanasam Mankind won't leave the star system.  We are a doomed species.
[4:20:21] <tanarath> Earth WOULD have made the inteloper
[4:20:23] <%bassoontyphoon> Tfw no space travel and therefore no qt owlboy bf
[4:20:24] <not_twitter_rowan> @HiveMasterMind pretty much
[4:20:24] <%Monkeyweed21> reminder that there are multiple planets with dark brambles growing on them
[4:20:25] <RoughBoulder22> @GeneralSCPatton capitalism in a nutshell
[4:20:26] <+blaze__drag> dark bramble is fucky wucky
[4:20:27] <thetntm> it's basically a weed that killls solar systems
[4:20:30] <stoatacious> eye of the universe is 1 eye, owls have 2 eyes, nomai are 3 eyes, hearthians are 4 eyes
[4:20:30] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @HiveMasterMind yea
[4:20:34] <MyNameIsRasus> @hivemastermind half tree half eldritch horror
[4:20:42] <%drabberfaun535> can you avoid the universal death in a different dimensions? like the dark bramble dimension has a clear separation of space
[4:20:49] <+hoenhime344> dont. get. eaten
[4:20:53] <%alcors_wisdom> unfortunately the only rocks that can defy the fundamental features of physics we have are quantum computers and they barely work
[4:20:57] <+Pequod1> @bassoontyphoon just wanna be a alien interplanetary archaeologist
[4:20:59] <+blaze__drag> you still get supernova'd in dark bramble
[4:21:07] <HiveMasterMind> So the next DLC alien race will either be 0 eyes or 5
[4:21:25] <$dalmek> 5 eyes burgers and fries
[4:21:27] <%tank7013> The dark bramble is almost as terrifying as the damn heat death is
[4:21:27] <%razielhex> @stoatacious I declare thumb wars
[4:21:29] <+extantCadence> @drabberfaun535 The supernova just tears through the whole place and only takes maybe a few extra seconds to do it
[4:21:31] <%Mr_Pylon> 3rd times the charm
[4:21:31] <%SovPho> i believe in you
[4:21:32] <%Piemen99> that's what she said
[4:21:35] <jorniev> DOES PAT HAVE THE PASSWORD?
[4:21:36] <%SovPho> there's no rush you have like 18 minutes
[4:21:36] <nomos42> patience
[4:21:37] <teebos> this is the one
[4:21:39] <teebos> i feel it
[4:21:44] <%bassoontyphoon> psaBig psaDab
[4:21:44] <cureneckbeard> the patword
[4:21:48] <nomos42> you reload your save
[4:21:50] <%Piemen99> @jorniev yes
[4:21:52] <%razielhex> because you keep dying
[4:21:54] <+Pequod1> remember the eject button!
[4:21:54] <$dalmek> it "Loads Last Save" which precedes you marking the vessel
[4:21:56] <%walternatorz> because you die the dead dead
[4:21:56] <%razielhex> to angler fish
[4:21:56] <%drabberfaun535> No headlights
[4:21:56] <%Monkeyweed21> because you die
[4:21:57] <captain_kirkhammer> Because you select it then end the loop
[4:21:58] <smoothwood07> i'm clapping for pat, because I believe
[4:22:00] <%topendbuzza> because you are game overing
[4:22:01] <%Valdorick> You're setting it then perma dying, so its not saving, because there's no time loop
[4:22:02] <Frogwash> tdogAAAA tdogAAAA
[4:22:02] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe what you do after taking the core out doesn't save.
[4:22:03] <%CatastropheCorvid> Because you keep dying for real real.
[4:22:04] <+blaze__drag> it's cause you die so what you did on the last loop doesn't count
[4:22:09] <iosephe> information can't be passed back in time because there is no warp core
[4:22:13] <%Fooguwu> Now remember Pat: SCIENCE RULES!!
[4:22:14] <%RayReborne> MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE
[4:22:14] <%tank7013> Hey here's this interstellar weed that takes over your planet and shoves it into a pocket dimension full of giant angler fish
[4:22:17] <%Logoth_> this time for sure
[4:22:18] <+extantCadence> Eighth time's the charm or whatever number attempt we're on
[4:22:19] <IHaveNoFunnyName> When you die it doesn't loop, it *reloads your previous save*
[4:22:20] <DigiLapin> 3rd times the charm
[4:22:20] <%walternatorz> Sun dodged
[4:22:21] <RoughBoulder22> what chance of him getting eaten again? LUL
[4:22:25] <%baka_sugoi> Space the final frontier
[4:22:27] <jorniev> is this more intense than the final deathloop LOOP?
[4:22:29] <vVAstrAVv> its undoing because every fail is a game over not a new loop
[4:22:35] <%Logoth_> He'll do it flawlessly this time
[4:22:40] <%Fooguwu> @RoughBoulder22 90%
[4:22:42] <MyNameIsRasus> @roughboulder22 60%
[4:22:50] <%Monkeyweed21> 2 seconds of full throttle, then stop
[4:22:57] <tanarath> Extra failsafe of: last entangler gets to go again @patstaresat
[4:22:58] <KasiCrafter> You REALLY yeeted yourself far with that Sun dodge, damn
[4:23:01] <%Fooguwu> we havent even gotten to the hard part with the 3 fish
[4:23:03] <MyNameIsRasus> SourPls
[4:23:05] <%walternatorz> what's going to happen if dying for real negated the dlc run?
[4:23:10] <+Pequod1> the fuckin explosions
[4:23:12] <%Puhff> This time, he'll be deadly serious next time.
[4:23:14] <nomos42> Does chat remeber the correct bramble path in terms of left/right signals?
[4:23:21] <not_twitter_rowan> @walternatorz it didn't/
[4:23:26] <+upandadam> have you seen the guy who notices the supernovas on ember twin?
[4:23:27] <%tank7013> It's so good. Like I said earlier I swear taking the core accelerates it
[4:23:29] <DaCheekyOne> Don't fuck this up @PatStaresAt
[4:23:30] <WyvernsArentDragons> I mean, yeah, the universe is dying super hard
[4:23:31] <%razielhex> but relativistically they'd have popped off thousands, if nottens of thousands of years ago
[4:23:31] <captain_kirkhammer> @walternatorz it wouldn't, he looped after meeting the dude
[4:23:32] <thetntm> but you can still play the game for like 20 hours and not know until chert tells you
[4:23:33] <not_twitter_rowan> GUN IT INSIDE
[4:23:34] <%Mr_Pylon> I first noticed the stars going out early in the game after riding on the Interloper for a while, it was wild
[4:23:43] <+hoenhime344> dont get eat
[4:23:50] <aeonicVector> chill the boosters
[4:23:51] <nomos42> you've got so much speed
[4:23:52] <stoatacious> don't rush
[4:23:53] <%RayReborne> stop engining
[4:23:54] <Ben_Lunaris> Maximum warp PunOko
[4:23:56] <%razielhex> I still hear the toot
[4:23:58] <%Fooguwu> If you can hear it breathing dont touch SHIT
[4:24:03] <vVAstrAVv> gently
[4:24:03] <DukeBlack_> STOP BOOSTING
[4:24:03] <%Frost_Quill> you can see number go down
[4:24:05] <WyvernsArentDragons> there is a no fog dark bramble mod
[4:24:05] <waltzqueen> STOP TOUCHING THE GAS
[4:24:06] <Visorak6> GUN IT
[4:24:06] <%topendbuzza> there is a mod
[4:24:07] <%Monkeyweed21> NO YOU DONT
[4:24:08] <The_hidden_> probe?
[4:24:08] <thetntm> GUN IT
[4:24:09] <Explodincatz> use your scout
[4:24:09] <stoatacious> boost in
[4:24:12] <jorniev> wasnt the red one EGGS?
[4:24:12] <%SveriSageAdvice> remember, gun it if you need to move
[4:24:16] <tanarath> STOP BOOSTING
[4:24:17] <%razielhex> YUMYUM
[4:24:17] <%Logoth_> FIRST TRY
[4:24:20] <FleshFriend> bahahahaha
[4:24:25] <The_hidden_> he wasn't boosting
[4:24:25] <%Fooguwu> gotta build more momentum
[4:24:25] <DaCheekyOne> I hate you @PatStaresAt
[4:24:25] <meteor530> Haha
[4:24:25] <%RealThiele> gun
[4:24:26] <MartyFun11> Pat you are ramming into the fish
[4:24:27] <$ArcanumArcanum> you were drifting sideways
[4:24:28] <stoatacious> PAT
[4:24:28] <WyvernsArentDragons> LUL
[4:24:28] <%Mr_Pylon> oh no
[4:24:29] <+hoenhime344> you got eat
[4:24:29] <%X2Eliah> Fucking WHY
[4:24:30] <leole11> gun it
[4:24:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat
[4:24:31] <Oath_Othelio> gun the into the red, and  then coast when yuou're in there
[4:24:31] <akitanito> just bum rush I guess
[4:24:31] <+Nahual_Amini> Let inertia move you there
[4:24:32] <DigiLapin> jermaPluto
[4:24:32] <EternalJedi> aren't you supposed to NOT use the ship?
[4:24:32] <MartyFun11> It's being alerted by you touching it
[4:24:33] <%Valdorick> If you keep adjusting direction, you'll lose forward velocity
[4:24:34] <%TarikBot> Are you just accidentally hitting an angler in the face
[4:24:34] <ZE_Count> maybe you should practise
[4:24:34] <+23Carrot> 1 PIP ONLY
[4:24:36] <%DrTomT18> take a break pat
[4:24:37] <+VStan11> gun it from a distance
[4:24:37] <MyNameIsRasus> INERTIA
[4:24:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> why are you so bad at this pat
[4:24:39] <thetntm> that time you just rammed into the fish
[4:24:39] <ThDark> Gun it at the start then coast in?
[4:24:40] <stoatacious> PATRICK
[4:24:40] <jorniev> GG
[4:24:40] <%Dakuu75> I like how chat is telling pat to both "cool it with the engines" and "gun it"
[4:24:41] <Frogwash> If you got the round trip you don't meet that guy first
[4:24:42] <+extantCadence> Wow I think you managed to actually run into the thing
[4:24:43] <%Like51bears> pat go there first and practice
[4:24:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> momentums a bitch
[4:24:46] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> ONE PIP ONLY
[4:24:47] <HiveMasterMind> Goto bramble first so you can test moving
[4:24:47] <LtThunderbolt> lol
[4:24:48] <Ben_Lunaris> Impatient fool rbzLul
[4:24:49] <jorniev> F
[4:24:49] <Oath_Othelio> maybe take a practice run lol
[4:24:50] <MartyFun11> You're hitting the angler in the face
[4:24:50] <+BloodyBurney> dont know why people keep saying to go fast, slow and steady in there is how i did it
[4:24:51] <%intylerwe_trust> Chat is killing you, pull up a guide lol
[4:24:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> he hasnt done this in forever, cut him some slack lol
[4:24:55] <HiveMasterMind> practice in bramble
[4:24:58] <captain_kirkhammer> One pip close, five pip far, nothing else
[4:24:58] <%derpy_platypus> dry run
[4:24:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Your inertia is carrying you
[4:25:00] <+VStan11> build up speed early
[4:25:01] <+23Carrot> You can adjust with 1 pip
[4:25:01] <leole11> you can literally just gun it in the first chamber
[4:25:03] <cizal11> How many times do you have to fail this before you just do dry runs
[4:25:04] <DukeBlack_> @Dakuu75 they're telling him to choose
[4:25:07] <%Fooguwu> @Dakuu75 Cuz it's both. You gotta gun it at the start and then touch nothing
[4:25:07] <%jtdobyns> This sucks.. They should do something about that
[4:25:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Pull up a guide mam
[4:25:08] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Do some practice runs
[4:25:08] <+23Carrot> But anything past makes noise
[4:25:10] <ZE_Count> do understand pips pat the yellow lights on the ship
[4:25:12] <$ArcanumArcanum> When you get into bramble hold A to match velocity. Then line up. Then move forward
[4:25:12] <vVAstrAVv> youtube it
[4:25:13] <meteor530> Yr moving sticks too much
[4:25:13] <CrypticMochi> Past Pat mocks your bramble runs
[4:25:14] <Ben_Lunaris> Pat this is a stealth mission, don't screw up rbzEZ
[4:25:16] <%Mattais88> I want pat to get t the end and the ending hasn't changed a bit
[4:25:16] <nomos42> that was weird
[4:25:18] <aeonicVector> @Dakuu75 cause those are the 2 answers, you either gun it from second 1 and crash temporarily, or coast silently
[4:25:18] <%bassoontyphoon> psaCanada
[4:25:23] <%sirisvirus> maybe practice dark bramble real quick to get used to it
[4:25:24] <thetntm> you can just flat out gun it in the first room
[4:25:29] <leole11> right analog stick is fine
[4:25:29] <MyNameIsRasus> @you need to move a lot at the start
[4:25:29] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe try practicing in bramble first?
[4:25:30] <%polothegreatest> this is like telling woolie batman is a rythm game
[4:25:35] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt you are safe as long as the pips on the boosters only hit 1 pip
[4:25:35] <MartyFun11> He's drifting directly into an angler fish is the problem
[4:25:37] <jorniev> holy shit
[4:25:37] <thetntm> it's not until you go through the red that you have to not touch anything
[4:25:41] <stoatacious> you can turn and not alert anglerfish
[4:25:41] <MyNameIsRasus> to direct yourself to wherr you want to go
[4:25:44] <+hoenhime344> drop your sheild
[4:25:45] <%Fooguwu> sun
[4:25:45] <CrematedCube> If you drift straight, you'll hit an angler
[4:25:46] <%Fooguwu> SUN
[4:25:48] <+Pequod1> rip
[4:25:49] <%Mr_Pylon> Sun time
[4:25:49] <+TombstoneTTromboners> into the sun bab

[4:25:51] <$dalmek> sun
[4:25:52] <cureneckbeard> Ame into the sun
[4:25:52] <leole11> the first room is free if you gun it, there's no reason to be cautious in the first room
[4:25:52] <%RayReborne> SUN
[4:25:52] <+Pequod1> dead again
[4:25:53] <%X2Eliah> sun dive
[4:25:53] <Mr_Rakjo> SUN
[4:25:54] <ZE_Count> do you see tyh eyllow thing on left pat the pips
[4:25:55] <thetntm> PAT THE SUN
[4:25:57] <tanarath> SUN
[4:25:57] <jorniev> THANK THE LORD THE DEVS JUST DIDNT CHOOSE TO DO THAT ONE THING I FEARED
[4:25:58] <captain_kirkhammer> You did it a year and a half ago no trouble ez peezy
[4:25:59] <Frostilk> sun
[4:25:59] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[4:25:59] <%Valdorick> OH NO

[4:26:08] <cureneckbeard> nyannHeh
[4:26:08] <stoatacious> it's not stupid, you just don't have all the info
[4:26:08] <%Fooguwu> LOOK OUT PAT!
[4:26:09] <%derpy_platypus> to youtube for the ending
[4:26:12] <jorniev> NO SUN
[4:26:13] <MyNameIsRasus> fwoosh
[4:26:14] <+MightyPolo> That wasn't a Bright idea ;)
[4:26:15] <thehornypastrypuffer> :)
[4:26:16] <%DrTomT18> Pat, you need to give your brain a break
[4:26:17] <%Maids4lyfe> YEYEYEYE
[4:26:20] <Forbidden_Karp> THESUNTHESUNTHESUNTHESUN
[4:26:21] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt I think you legit did it first try last time.
[4:26:22] <+extantCadence> Mmmm, autopiloting into the sun is such a classic in this game
[4:26:26] <+hoenhime344> i... how do you hit the sun?? its the biggest thing thin the solar system
[4:26:29] <%Mr_Pylon> Watch out Arisen! The Sun is hot!
[4:26:30] <%RayReborne> "Pat the Sun" is somethng i ddnt expect to see 😂
[4:26:32] <meteor530> ThERE'S AN IDEA
[4:26:34] <%cvp5127> yea cheating
[4:26:39] <%Faustgesicht> watching it right now
[4:26:44] <%Deft_Thought> So why does getting chomped by the Angler a "You Are Dead" instead of a loop?
[4:26:44] <ZE_Count> do you understand the pips?
[4:26:44] <thehornypastrypuffer> BRIAN LOOK OUT
[4:26:45] <%derpy_platypus> Past Pat pull some pro gamer moves
[4:26:47] <%jtdobyns> RIP... There should be a shortcut for people who have already beaten the game
[4:26:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> i can go and pull up the video with the timestamp if you want it
[4:26:52] <KasiCrafter> Let's Watch Let's Play Outer Wilds!
[4:26:55] <%cvp5127> past pat is so smart
[4:26:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> @hoenhime344 that makes it the easiest thing to hit
[4:26:58] <stoatacious> anybody keeping track of how many tries?
[4:26:59] <Forbidden_Karp> avoid large hot ball
[4:27:01] <tanarath> Space suit
[4:27:05] <+TombstoneTTromboners> pat did you know the ship has a throttle of which you can control the speed of
[4:27:06] <%G_Thunders> Past Pat was a much better gamer
[4:27:07] <%Mr_Pylon> sun time agzin
[4:27:10] <%Mattais88> Sun again
[4:27:11] <+hoenhime344> pat the sun
[4:27:13] <vVAstrAVv> angler fossil?
[4:27:18] <The_hidden_> "You can also use your scout to distract them from afar, though this generally isn’t necessary."
[4:27:19] <ZE_Count> just one yellow pat practice right now!!
[4:27:21] <%ElkRiverDog> Maybe 5 minute break to stretch?
[4:27:25] <+extantCadence> At this rate, he might take more attempts to do this than it took me to land on the sun station
[4:27:31] <ZE_Count> slight pressure one yellow
[4:27:37] <stoatacious> yeah take a break
[4:27:42] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Kinda the point
[4:27:50] <Ben_Lunaris> Note Whoever's gonna make a compilation of this, leave ALL of this bit in rbzLul
[4:27:57] <MartyFun11> You're hitting the angler fish in the face
[4:28:04] <leole11> literally just gun it
[4:28:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> you gotta make sure you're coasting in the right direction
[4:28:06] <$ArcanumArcanum> your initial velocity upon entering bramble has been a sideways drift each time
[4:28:07] <stoatacious> match velocitiy when you enter
[4:28:09] <teebos> i think moving your sight/angle makes some noise too
[4:28:11] <%Frost_Quill> You're running into the anglerfish.
[4:28:12] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you can gun it in this room
[4:28:13] <Treasure_Vault> go fast slowly as quickly as you can leisurely maneuver
[4:28:13] <thetntm> gun it NOW
[4:28:23] <+extantCadence> @Ben_Lunaris Just do a death montage for it
[4:28:26] <+TombstoneTTromboners> :)
[4:28:28] <%Mr_Pylon> You entered from a different side?
[4:28:29] <waltzqueen> ???
[4:28:29] <cizal11> Turning the ship with the right stick counts as moving
[4:28:29] <DigiLapin> jermaPluto
[4:28:30] <captain_kirkhammer> Different entrance
[4:28:31] <$ArcanumArcanum> different entrance
[4:28:32] <CrematedCube> Gun it toward the red light before coasting
[4:28:35] <iosephe> Anglerfish move over time
[4:28:36] <$dalmek> @PatStaresAt different entrances give you different vantage points
[4:28:37] <RoughBoulder22> you already drifted BECAUSE YOU BOOSTED AFTER YOU ENTERED
[4:28:37] <+extantCadence> That was a different entrance
[4:28:38] <Explodincatz> use your scout
[4:28:39] <%Monkeyweed21> there are multiple entrances
[4:28:39] <RyuuAoi> Bugs
[4:28:40] <stoatacious> my dude..
[4:28:41] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> unkown
[4:28:41] <%topendbuzza> diffent hole
[4:28:42] <MyNameIsRasus> Different entrance
[4:28:42] <mr_saturday93> different entrances
[4:28:46] <%SovPho> yeah it has 4 entrances
[4:28:49] <%RayReborne> oh yeah, orbit
[4:28:49] <captain_kirkhammer> Like 3
[4:28:50] <WyvernsArentDragons> the entrances are the same I thought???
[4:28:52] <%bassoontyphoon> Different hole
[4:28:56] <%SovPho> 2 entrances?
[4:28:59] <%Valdorick> Hey I forget, do the headlights... trigger them?
[4:29:00] <Forbidden_Karp> 4, you say?
[4:29:08] <%X2Eliah> try fish but whole ?
[4:29:09] <thetntm> lol IDK the anglerfish was in a straight up different location
[4:29:09] <ZE_Count> I mean you can rest and watch your video
[4:29:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Anglerfish are blind
[4:29:15] <KasiCrafter> Remember, Dark Bramble has some WACKY Non-Euclidean space going on
[4:29:15] <%RayReborne> dont you need the Key from Ash Twin?
[4:29:16] <ingman112> They're blind so they can't see the headlights
[4:29:17] <$hooppawesomeness> did they actually change this? cause I remember doing exactly what pats doing with no problem
[4:29:17] <stoatacious> YOUCAN DO IT WITHOUT SHIP
[4:29:17] <iosephe> anglerfish are blind
[4:29:18] <tanarath> They're blind, sound does
[4:29:19] <%dekkitout> Time to trial and error this like them good ol wright bros- and sister
[4:29:19] <WyvernsArentDragons> the fish are blind, the lights do nothing to them
[4:29:24] <%Mr_Pylon> Don't give up, Skeleton
[4:29:24] <DukeBlack_> did he get the gravity thing?
[4:29:26] <%Mattais88> So we just give up on the power cell then/
[4:29:27] <Ben_Lunaris> Find the right hole Pat SeemsGood
[4:29:32] <%Frost_Quill> @RayReborne He's practicing.
[4:29:32] <%razielhex> first chamber has 1 angler, maze chamber has 4-5 anglers; so you have to get through half a dozen fishies to get to the vessel
[4:29:38] <thetntm> you can outrun them if you're close enough to the next room
[4:29:40] <%RayReborne> ah
[4:29:40] <+extantCadence> @WyvernsArentDragons Nope, there's totally like 4 entrances for every one of the seed things
[4:29:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh ok so you headed to a white duplicate signal for a second, then boosted towards the red in your old video
[4:29:44] <%RayReborne> indeed
[4:29:45] <%bassoontyphoon> Any hole is a goal pat
[4:29:49] <+JustToWatch> but steel is heavier than feathers...
[4:29:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> stop boosting before you even float in
[4:29:49] <%X2Eliah> @Mattais88 he needs to learn how to bramble 1st
[4:29:53] <MyNameIsRasus> hoof it on the first room. try it.
[4:29:57] <%derpy_platypus> may have buffed AI aggro with DLC?
[4:29:58] <ZE_Count> just watch your old video
[4:30:08] <+extantCadence> @razielhex Each entrance to the egg chamber has 3 iirc
[4:30:10] <+TombstoneTTromboners> do you know the definition of insanity? it's doing the same fucking thing over and over again and expecting a different result

[4:39:31] <mr_saturday93> damn just barely
[4:39:31] <RoughBoulder22> you drifted cause you boosted after you entered
[4:39:32] <%Logoth_> This seems really weirdly designed
[4:39:32] <%RetroCop87> Pat at risk
[4:39:32] <Vyskus> damn
[4:39:32] <%Faustgesicht> FUCK

[4:39:44] <%razielhex> Almost midnight my dude
[4:39:44] <@Spydurman> but gun it tjo
[4:39:44] <Explodincatz> why do u never shoot your scout?
[4:39:44] <mr_saturday93> DEEP BREATHS
[4:39:45] <Treasure_Vault> that's buff, ruddy
[4:39:45] <%intylerwe_trust> BRO
[4:39:46] <%CatastropheCorvid> STREAM OVER
[4:39:47] <MyNameIsRasus> If you're not headed straight for it, just gun it immediately
[4:39:47] <Forbidden_Karp> Nevertheless he persisted
[4:39:48] <stoatacious> take a 5 min break
[4:39:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> start slow so you don't have to course correct so much
[4:39:49] <ZE_Count> its fine pat we saw the ending of the dlc
[4:39:49] <%SovPho> Okay it's not worth it at this point lol
[4:39:50] <thehornypastrypuffer> VOOOOOORe
[4:39:54] <%Frost_Quill> IMMEDIATELY thrust toward the red part and then let go.
[4:39:57] <+23Carrot> ONE PIP
[4:39:58] <KasiCrafter> Wait. Has Pat been matching his velocity with Dark Bramble BEFORE going in? It not, that explains the drifting
[4:39:59] <ReenBenkyou> Oh no
[4:40:00] <not_twitter_rowan> @logoth_ it's not, Pat did it in one shot on his first go, he's just having a rough time
[4:40:05] <%Valdorick> Just do EVERYTHING.
[4:40:08] <Ben_Lunaris> Time to do the ultimate cheat and watch someone else do the ending TPFufun
[4:40:08] <%RetroCop87> no go slow and steady
[4:40:08] <+extantCadence> @logoth_ I've watched a lot of people do this and never seen anyone struggle like this
[4:40:09] <%Dakuu75> Chat... Chat... ssssshhhhhhh
[4:40:09] <teebos> GO FAST. BUT GO SLOW. DONT MOVE. BUT GUN IT
[4:40:09] <%derpy_platypus> go fast, but go slow, but also don't
[4:40:11] <%topendbuzza> line up 1st gun
[4:40:11] <doggieo> There comes a time when you face the toughest of fights
[4:40:12] <%Like51bears> pat everyone here dies at least 10 times doing it
[4:40:12] <blastazoid00> @patstaresat stop at the start, align, gas it and drift
[4:40:13] <%Mattais88> You gotta quiet, as loud as you can
[4:40:15] <DigiLapin> the universe is full of mystery :)
[4:40:16] <@Spydurman> Don't go too fast. Don't go too slow. Don't enter it at all
[4:40:17] <%Dakuu75> emote only mode
[4:40:17] <%senfood> I got back and it just says "YOU ARE DEAD." and Pat is just facepalming.
[4:40:17] <%Maids4lyfe> yes you got it
[4:40:17] <masterfire23> Yes
[4:40:18] <%RayReborne> lmao Chat is all over the place
[4:40:18] <Visorak6> Go in slow, stop, and then line up before you start boosting towards it
[4:40:19] <Teras_ode> just no 4Head
[4:40:19] <bear_breaker20> feel the force like luke did
[4:40:20] <%DrTomT18> Pat, please take a break
[4:40:21] <CrematedCube> Gun it to the red, then drift
[4:40:21] <Vyskus> Just fly in there 4Head
[4:40:21] <jorniev> DIG UP
[4:40:21] <+JustToWatch> just do all those things and you're golden
[4:40:22] <stoatacious> pat pat all the advice is correect
[4:40:22] <RoughBoulder22> @PatStaresAt you boosted after you entered, that threw off your direction, it always puts you straight
[4:40:23] <%RetroCop87> you got old
[4:40:23] <ZE_Count> just learn how to fly the ship at 1 pip
[4:40:25] <$Shaggy2124> Just go the same speed you went when you beat the game the first time xD
[4:40:25] <%topendbuzza> luck?
[4:40:25] <%intylerwe_trust> Hahaha please pull up a guide
[4:40:27] <%Faustgesicht> Did they patch it?
[4:40:27] <akitanito> because you trust youself
[4:40:28] <jorniev> JUST DIG UP PAT
[4:40:28] <$dalmek> you had practice flying and not 2 years of rust
[4:40:28] <%SovPho> I don't think it's worth it at this point.
[4:40:29] <%Puhff> See, you got it!
[4:40:29] <@Ranryu692> because you had just spent a while playing the game
[4:40:30] <%NateyBeak> because you were used to the fish i guess
[4:40:30] <RyuuAoi> Pat don't need a break. Let him beat it.
[4:40:31] <vVAstrAVv> youre just boosting too hard. dont go over 2 "pips"
[4:40:32] <nomos42> they've changed stuff i think
[4:40:32] <+TombstoneTTromboners> put us into emote only mode mods
[4:40:33] <%Monkeyweed21> you werent as old
[4:40:33] <Dr_Bearington_The_Second> Listen to your heart
[4:40:34] <%Puhff> Oh no
[4:40:34] <%Mattais88> Fear is the Mind Killer
[4:40:34] <AoiRob> it's setting in
[4:40:35] <%Piemen99> @Piemen99 And they clearly had the tech to explore space and find another planet to use for their ring world
[4:40:36] <leole11> Gun it really slowly but then coast extremely fast
[4:40:36] <%derpy_platypus> you go left to drive right
[4:40:38] <+trizetacannon44> You weren't wanting to finish now
[4:40:38] <thetntm> because you had already explored dark bramble a bunch then
[4:40:39] <+blaze__drag> cause the first time was built on hours of learning every little detail of the main game
[4:40:39] <cureneckbeard> how did Past Pat do it
[4:40:39] <cheapdoc> Your brain had been steering ships for like the best part of a month the first time
[4:40:39] <%razielhex> Feldspar could do it Pat.  You can too!
[4:40:40] <$ArcanumArcanum> When you first enter you're far enough away to line up with the red dot and not alert the fish
[4:40:40] <MyNameIsRasus> Maybe pull up a guide?
[4:40:43] <vVAstrAVv> luck the 1st time
[4:40:44] <KasiCrafter> Well, you almost died twice the first time, to be fair
[4:40:44] <%intylerwe_trust> Pull up a guide lol
[4:40:45] <mr_saturday93> Just let go of your cock and then release everything all over the fish
[4:40:52] <MartyFun11> It was easy cause you were being super careful
[4:40:53] <ZE_Count> im trying to remember is this was easier with a mouse and keyboard
[4:40:55] <The_hidden_> @RoughBoulder22 <--
[4:40:56] <Ben_Lunaris> @PatStaresAt Enter it like you would enter Paige TehePelo
[4:40:57] <%VHGS> yeah
[4:40:59] <cizal11> It wasn’t, you got eaten by them over and over and over
[4:41:05] <not_twitter_rowan> @Piemen99 how would they get to it to use it's resources
[4:41:09] <IzanagiNoOokami> Maximum Speed Maximum Weed.
[4:41:10] <MyNameIsRasus> correct
[4:41:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> gentle but precise
[4:41:15] <CrypticMochi> I think past Pat might’ve lined it up before drifting there
[4:41:18] <%Fooguwu> Yes. Enter the bramble slowly, then once inside gun it for 2 seconds toward your destination and then release the gas. This will send you the right direction so you won't side drift.
[4:41:22] <%baka_sugoi> @Ben_Lunaris in the butt?
[4:41:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> decisive even
[4:41:25] <+Orcapugs> Or just look it up at this point
[4:41:31] <%Mattais88> Loose, but tight
[4:41:37] <thetntm> go in, stop, aim at dot, gun it, let go of the controller, gun it again when you see the exit
[4:41:37] <stoatacious> @Fooguwu THIS
[4:41:39] <cizal11> By the time you were doing the run you’d already figured out the fish, so you’re having to completely relearn it for the hardest part of@the game
[4:41:40] <%Mr_Pylon> I think the entrance that you're using coming from Ash Twin points directly at the Angler, so if you just coast you'll bump into it?
[4:41:43] <vVAstrAVv> its all about thrust noise baby
[4:41:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt are you remembering to stop your momentum before you line it up
[4:41:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> we're here for another hour gamers
[4:41:48] <%polothegreatest> psaFist psaPat
[4:41:49] <%Puhff> Pat it's simple: just avoid the fish
[4:41:55] <cheapdoc> T MINUS 4 minutes before you look it up
[4:41:55] <tanarath> You can match velocity once inside to stop.
[4:41:57] <ZE_Count> WATCH YOURSELF
[4:41:58] <leole11> now's personal
[4:42:02] <%derpy_platypus> just don't get hit
[4:42:04] <stoatacious> it's ok to admit you can't do it
[4:42:06] <nomos42> suit reminder
[4:42:07] <%G_Thunders> Just do exactly what VOD Pat did
[4:42:11] <XavorinVG> Yo did he forget his suit?
[4:42:13] <%Frost_Quill> Match velocity once inside, not outside.
[4:42:14] <%walternatorz> there's this streamer I know that was able to one shot it, you should watch him
[4:42:17] <thetntm> how do you fast forward a livestream
[4:42:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> in all fairness, controlling shit in zero g is hard
[4:42:22] <%Puhff> Look up your own VOD LUL
[4:42:24] <ZE_Count> okay pat do you see the yellow thrust things on the left right?
[4:42:28] <Ben_Lunaris> Baby mode still on btw rbzLul
[4:42:31] <%intylerwe_trust> Just be 2 years younger and do what VOD Pat did
[4:42:32] <@Ranryu692> @thetntm get blackout drunk
[4:42:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> especially when you don't have a velocity vector
[4:42:36] <vVAstrAVv> its ok if pp shrank
[4:42:36] <+TombstoneTTromboners> into the sun
[4:42:37] <%MelBrooksKA> AngriestPat would have done this in one shot spyCappa
[4:42:40] <@Spydurman> this dude called PatStaresAt did it pretty good, watch how he did it
[4:42:43] <%baka_sugoi> SUN
[4:42:44] <%derpy_platypus> close call
[4:42:47] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[4:42:49] <mr_saturday93> those fish basically are super blind but have great hearing. There's like 3 of them around the red light so make sure you cum at it in the right angle and let inertia do the rest
[4:42:50] <%Buzzard42> LUL
[4:42:52] <raikagelord1> Didn’t he just use the suit to get their ?
[4:42:54] <Dr_Bearington_The_Second> @thetntm by sleeping

[4:43:10] <%polothegreatest> psaSmug
[4:43:12] <akitanito> what's the difference between VOD pat god and this pat?
[4:43:13] <%topendbuzza> FROM THE TOP ROPE
[4:43:13] <thetntm> BETTER THAN CRASHING INTO THE SUN
[4:43:16] <+blaze__drag> maybe this is the work of an enemy stand
[4:43:17] <raikagelord1> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:43:17] <Zalapski> ok that was good content tho
[4:43:17] <%Puhff> that'll do it

[4:43:21] <+Orcapugs> Bang your head against the wall. The Pat way. 😂
[4:43:23] <%intylerwe_trust> 5 minute stretch maybe lol
[4:43:25] <CrypticMochi> I’m down for PatStaresAt past Pat
[4:43:25] <vVAstrAVv> good thing you suffocated lol
[4:43:26] <ZE_Count> YOU BEAT THE DLC  PAT dont let anyone take that away from ya.
[4:43:27] <%bassoontyphoon> This is getting increasingly comical
[4:43:29] <@Spydurman> so about watching that vod . . .
[4:43:30] <stoatacious> it's ok to admit you aren't good enough to do it this time
[4:43:32] <+blaze__drag> I think he's doing this on purpose at this point
[4:43:32] <%Agami23> the difference is about a full game of piloting
[4:43:32] <MyNameIsRasus> that was a straight up slingshot
[4:43:32] <%Puhff> It Wasn't the Sun tho :)
[4:43:38] <%intylerwe_trust> This is becoming a thing
[4:43:40] <%Piemen99> @Piemen99 Make smaller ships -> Go to different planet -> set up ship yard -> Then break down planet for Ring world
[4:43:42] <+TombstoneTTromboners> @akitanito engaged and now has 2 kids. he's lost his gamer power.
[4:43:45] <+blaze__drag> he's filling for time
[4:43:45] <Explodincatz> getting worse every run
[4:43:46] <Ben_Lunaris> I'll come back in the morning, we'll still be here yeah? ResidentSleeper
[4:43:48] <%walternatorz> I'm having a great time.
[4:43:49] <blastazoid00> TILTED
[4:43:49] <thehornypastrypuffer> yeah real funny big guy
[4:43:50] <$Shaggy2124> Top  shelf comedy
[4:43:51] <%Mattais88> Its getting better and better honestly
[4:43:51] <$ArcanumArcanum> Nothing wastes more time than trying to save time
[4:43:51] <%Mr_Pylon> The Sun misadventures are always fun
[4:43:52] <+VStan11> its a good bit
[4:43:54] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You know, Mass Effect 3 would be far easier to finish
[4:43:54] <MyNameIsRasus> i am
[4:43:54] <+extantCadence> I'm having a great time tbh
[4:43:54] <mr_saturday93> Imagine if there's no change....
[4:43:57] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn NotLikeThis sbfpSetIn NotLikeThis sbfpSetIn psaGoblin
[4:44:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat losing his sanity in a time loop
[4:44:01] <nomos42> it's not even that major
[4:44:03] <%bassoontyphoon> I am!

[4:44:03] <%polothegreatest> psaJpeg
[4:44:03] <%Puhff> What a great bit Kappa
[4:44:04] <%MrUnKnownAlien> watch this get turn into a counter vid soon
[4:44:06] <%RayReborne> literally never touched this game and this stream has been great
[4:44:08] <RoughBoulder22> @ArcanumArcanum and being frustrated while doing it
[4:44:09] <vVAstrAVv> I AM having a good time
[4:44:14] <%Mattais88> If I wnated perfection I'd watch GGDQ
[4:44:15] <RyuuAoi> We're having fun, Pat! Your streams are great!
[4:44:18] <%cvp5127> remember always cheat
[4:44:21] <%intylerwe_trust> Watch the change be 2 lines of dialogue
[4:44:29] <%Buzzard42> no they LOVE the sound of your engines
[4:44:31] <Ben_Lunaris> Pat is literally stuck in a timeloop rbzLul
[4:44:34] <KasiCrafter> You also did it with Paige watching
[4:44:34] <%Buzzard42> that's the problem
[4:44:41] <%cooldude69xx> Drint in their mouth
[4:44:49] <%cooldude69xx> *Drift
[4:44:53] <%razielhex> META-LOOP
[4:44:53] <%G_Thunders> The changes are worth seeing, but I still think VOD Pat should be the one guiding you here
[4:44:54] <captain_kirkhammer> @intylerwe_trust the change is worth it
[4:44:54] <+Orcapugs> We’re ending this in 16 minutes. Crazy talk requiem
[4:44:57] <MyNameIsRasus> it's a bit more complex than just coast
[4:44:58] <%MrUnKnownAlien> crazy talk works from this far in the past lol
[4:45:06] <thetntm> you only need to do that in the second room
[4:45:09] <%Puhff> @intylerwe_trust "And the Owls were there too. The End"
[4:45:10] <RyuuAoi> Boost until you see the white of their eyes
[4:45:14] <Ben_Lunaris> The power of girls are watching will give you power TPFufun
[4:45:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt are you remembering to match velocity before you line it up
[4:45:18] <%Frost_Quill> You need to make sure you're going toward the red dot at first instead of drifting to the side.
[4:45:22] <+extantCadence> You're supposed to point yourself at the entrance you want, not just drift immediately
[4:45:24] <doggieo> is your ship making noise?
[4:45:32] <leole11> he doesn't remember that the first room is a literal joke
[4:45:34] <+TombstoneTTromboners> you enter into dark bramble at the same speed regardless
[4:45:39] <leole11> you can just go
[4:45:39] <$ArcanumArcanum> YES
[4:45:43] <Visorak6> yes
[4:45:43] <captain_kirkhammer> YES
[4:45:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ye
[4:45:44] <tanarath> YES
[4:45:44] <%X2Eliah> oh no
[4:45:45] <akitanito> yes
[4:45:46] <stoatacious> YES
[4:45:49] <+23Carrot> YES
[4:45:49] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe.
[4:45:50] <thetntm> YES
[4:45:50] <%Monkeyweed21> that would explain the drift
[4:45:51] <KasiCrafter> With the planet from outside
[4:45:52] <MyNameIsRasus> YES
[4:45:53] <AoiRob> ya
[4:45:55] <ZE_Count> I just 1 pip it just hold that thrust super lightly
[4:46:09] <stoatacious> WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU
[4:46:19] <akitanito> now you know
[4:46:22] <Tisaric> the anglerfish will literally not hear you if you stay at 1 pip max yeah
[4:46:25] <%Monkeyweed21> so you dont drift in a different direction
[4:46:33] <KasiCrafter> Everyone's been saying everything, lol
[4:46:36] <%RayReborne> I didnt see any clarification on Match Velocity in this damm chat LUL
[4:46:38] <%MrUnKnownAlien> big brain pat
[4:46:40] <%Agami23> and knowing is half the battle. GI Joooooooeeeee
[4:46:43] <MyNameIsRasus> probably
[4:46:43] <%Monkeyweed21> you would match velocity constantly yea
[4:46:44] <KasiCrafter> And yeah, you used to do it consistently from what I remember YEARS back
[4:46:55] <+TombstoneTTromboners> like 50 hours ago
[4:46:59] <mr_saturday93> angriest pat was stronger
[4:46:59] <%Frost_Quill> You practiced doing bramble before trying to do the final run to be fair.
[4:46:59] <DeadManProp> How come Pat is playing Outer Worlds again?
[4:46:59] <%dekkitout> Yeah, but that was AngriestPAt. He was a real gamer SeriousSloth
[4:47:03] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[4:47:04] <ZE_Count> dont let it set in pat
[4:47:04] <Ben_Lunaris> You have to do what a real astromancer would do SeemsGood
[4:47:06] <jorniev> like half an hour?
[4:47:09] <AoiRob> it's been 4 days
[4:47:09] <+blaze__drag> Pat, it's been 20 years
[4:47:10] <%RayReborne> 10:30?10:45?
[4:47:10] <%X2Eliah> At least 48 minutes ago
[4:47:11] <%polothegreatest> best stream psaSkelmo
[4:47:12] <+blaze__drag> you have to wake up now
[4:47:14] <nomos42> 22 minutes ago postingJoke
[4:47:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> it just seems extra bad because chat is struggling to explain realistic spaceflight physics
[4:47:20] <KasiCrafter> Pat. Pat. The first time you did this, you ACCIDENTALLY stumbled into the Ember Twin Core.
[4:47:21] <+BloodyBurney> its a time loop so ininite time
[4:47:23] <+VStan11> its been like 3 or 4 months
[4:47:23] <%bassoontyphoon> At this point I’m expecting the quantum moon to come out of nowhere and body Pats ship
[4:47:25] <%Puhff> 30 years
[4:47:26] <+twohitgood> looking up the vod, you definitely were not confident in getting past that first fish on your run.
[4:47:26] <%X2Eliah> Outer Worlds was so disappointing
[4:47:26] <Tisaric> god it was so fucking MEDIOCRE
[4:47:27] <%Agami23> good for exactly one planet
[4:47:28] <%intylerwe_trust> We should do predictions with channel points  at this point
[4:47:28] <MyNameIsRasus> TBF u barely fly in the dlc
[4:47:28] <jorniev> WAIT ISNT IT THIS GAME?
[4:47:28] <@Ranryu692> remember when that raid came in and you were like "if you don't want to see the ending within the next 16 minutes close your eyes" like half an hour ago
[4:47:29] <%X2Eliah> I hate it
[4:47:29] <%dekkitout> Was downhill after picking up Parvati
[4:47:29] <stoatacious> outer worlds sucked lmao
[4:47:31] <Visorak6> It was like a 7/10 at best
[4:47:32] <DeadManProp> Outer Wilds, I meant lol
[4:47:32] <RyuuAoi> That's on the Switch, right?
[4:47:34] <aeonicVector> Cant tell you how long its been, ive been in a loop of Pat Loops
[4:47:35] <%Puhff> FOR REAL
[4:47:36] <%X2Eliah> Outer Worlds SHOULD HAVE been good
[4:47:37] <%RayReborne> Whats bad with it Pat?
[4:47:39] <ZE_Count> a very 7.2 game
[4:47:39] <Tisaric> YEAH IT'S SO GOOD
[4:47:39] <jorniev> what game im i thinking about
[4:47:40] <%cooldude69xx> I haven't been that disappointed since Mass Effect 4 funny enough
[4:47:41] <%Frost_Quill> I liked it, but they shouldn't have advertised it as "Fallout New Vegas in space."
[4:47:42] <%polothegreatest> expectations were high
[4:47:42] <mr_saturday93> This is OUTER WILDS
[4:47:43] <Treasure_Vault> That game is a bummer is so many ways. The story is a bummer, the combat is a bummer, the minutiae is a bummer.
[4:47:43] <cizal11> You did it in one shot after getting eaten over and over prior to the run
[4:47:44] <DigiLapin> its a bummer it also released so close to wilds with a close name so no one noticed wilds jermaPluto
[4:47:44] <Tisaric> then it just fucking walks off a cliff
[4:47:47] <akitanito> they dumped all their budget in the first planet
[4:47:48] <+MaddogRasta> wasteland 3 was the true new vegas successor
[4:47:49] <ZE_Count> I her the DLC is good
[4:47:55] <jorniev> OUTER WORLDS IS NOT HTIS GAME RIGHT?
[4:47:55] <%cooldude69xx> *3 god damn
[4:47:59] <%JoshManVGH> First planet was a great demo to a better game
[4:47:59] <%bassoontyphoon> Outer worlds did the thing I hate the most in recent games which is to top load content
[4:48:01] <+WoodmanDotEXE> Hey Pat, you and Woolie's content has helped through what's been a really rough year. Keep up the good work.
[4:48:04] <%Puhff> iT WAS MAINLY THE LACK OF WEAPON VARIETY THAT KILLED IT FOR ME
[4:48:05] <%Agami23> mass effect 3?
[4:48:06] <Treasure_Vault> It had a lot of problems.
[4:48:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> the first planet was the best part? glad I didn't even finish that part then
[4:48:09] <%intylerwe_trust> The most 7/10 game ever
[4:48:13] <Ben_Lunaris> @PatStaresAt You're stuck in a real world timeloop WutFace
[4:48:17] <%razielhex> @RayReborne all the money and polish went to the first world and it peters out pretty quick after that in terms of quality and story-writing
[4:48:20] <+RemedyofRevenge> Weapon variety was pretty bad too
[4:48:24] <not_twitter_rowan> Yeah, honestly the story was what really killed it for me
[4:48:25] <Treasure_Vault> Less interesting, more depressing? I only remember the salesman with a moonface.
[4:48:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jorniev no outer worlds was the rpg, this is outer wilds
[4:48:30] <%Frost_Quill> Gotta top load content so people don't try to refund right away.
[4:48:30] <jorniev> AVERAGEST GAME OF THAT YEAR
[4:48:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> maybe next time they wont have a single person writing for each planet
[4:48:35] <The_hidden_> btw here's Pat's original easy run: Pat Stares At The Outer Wilds! (Part FINAL) - ***
[4:48:36] <%Fooguwu> you fuck that fish pat
[4:48:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> bless you
[4:48:38] <Treasure_Vault> Moonface salesman was the highlight of that game.
[4:48:38] <Frostilk> bless you
[4:48:42] <ZE_Count> bless
[4:48:42] <%baka_sugoi> YOU GOT THIS PAT AND BLESS
[4:48:43] <cureneckbeard> Bless you, Pat. Blat.
[4:48:43] <stoatacious> weapon varieety was AWFUL
[4:48:45] <Captain_Joe1911> bspSneese
[4:48:48] <+BloodyBurney> sneeze means good luck
[4:48:50] <DigiLapin> also how linear and not rpg it felt like playing a freeroam fps
[4:48:53] <%razielhex> every fukken time
[4:48:55] <nomos42> I guess that's designing your first level last not working out
[4:48:56] <%RayReborne> Hopefully the Sequel is better, since thats apparently a thing
[4:48:57] <%intylerwe_trust> Fun fact Josh Sawyer didn’t have much to do with it, kinda explains a lot
[4:48:57] <thetntm> that's a good luck sneeze, this is the run
[4:48:57] <%Frost_Quill> The Stranger?
[4:48:58] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it does not
[4:48:59] <Ben_Lunaris> The companions only had 1 line of dialogue for the ability you would certainly spamming forever NotLikeThis
[4:49:00] <%polothegreatest> would you play the dlc?
[4:49:00] <%bassoontyphoon> Bless you
[4:49:03] <%dekkitout> Fml, I forgot Outer Worlds is getting a sequel/do over sbfpSetIn
[4:49:05] <+RemedyofRevenge> the line about suicide counting as vandalism was great tho lol
[4:49:06] <%VHGS> yeah you died for realsies again
[4:49:12] <%razielhex> this is just deja vu.  We've had this discussion 3 times now
[4:49:12] <jetstreamlove_R> bless pat
[4:49:13] <%IonVaporStudios> Pat your sneeze woke up my cat. :P
[4:49:14] <Saltmeisterr> @The_hidden_ No links allowed
[4:49:17] <%intylerwe_trust> Josh Sawyer only overlooked the game, right?
[4:49:17] <%razielhex> PATLOOP
[4:49:23] <captain_kirkhammer> @dekkitout wait what
[4:49:26] <Treasure_Vault> I remember leaving the first world thinking "Wow, can't wait to start my second playthrough." That didn't happen.
[4:49:28] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yeah
[4:49:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> yup
[4:49:32] <%Tearonex> This time for SURE
[4:49:32] <%Valdorick> yes
[4:49:38] <DaCheekyOne> Man the music sounds so weird at 160p lol
[4:49:42] <%Valdorick> Nah, its the ash twins
[4:49:44] <Treasure_Vault> Maybe Outer Worlds just needs a bunch of mods to fix it.
[4:49:47] <%Frost_Quill> Or is it orbiting The Stranger?
[4:49:54] <%dekkitout> @dekkitout There's a sequel in the works. I call it a do over.
[4:50:00] <IHaveNoFunnyName> No that's orbiting the twins
[4:50:03] <Ben_Lunaris> RAMMING SPEED! PunOko
[4:50:06] <%Buzzard42> the Dark World in the Stranger is like an even better Quantum Moon
[4:50:09] <+RemedyofRevenge> Wait, an Outer Worlds 2?
[4:50:23] <%polothegreatest> people just wanted nv2
[4:50:24] <%Buzzard42> Dark World making you cheat to win is SO good
[4:50:24] <+WoodmanDotEXE> I remember when someone said "Don't look up" and you got worried
[4:50:27] <%RayReborne> yeah, its a thing thats being made
[4:50:27] <+twohitgood> i dunno. quantum moon is pretty interesting. if you look away from it, the whole thing disappears under your feet.
[4:50:33] <not_twitter_rowan> LINE YOURSELF UP
[4:50:43] <not_twitter_rowan> COAST

[4:52:49] <%jtdobyns> RIP
[4:52:52] <Kosinkadink> if you have to do adjustments, use very very tiny movements. even if the orange bars dont appear, you pressing a tiny bit on the joystick still moves you (you can see your POV/UI move)

[4:54:21] <Vyskus> I feel like this is the average Bramble experience
[4:54:21] <tanarath> Paige is here!
[4:54:22] <akitanito> you did it too well at first, now you see all the problems
[4:54:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> paige should totally play this
[4:54:26] <KasiCrafter> Paige WAS here the first time you played this game. She HATED the fish.
[4:54:28] <%jtdobyns> I know not spoilers but I do not think the ending is worth this much hassel

[4:58:02] <%Frost_Quill> This game is so good.
[4:58:03] <@PeachSaliva> Tell Pat he sucks

[4:58:34] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> You were saying
[4:58:35] <spinningchurro> i still wish you would’ve teared up at the ending of the first i’ve.
[4:58:35] <%Frost_Quill> Hollow Knight was up there I'd say.
[4:58:36] <jorniev> what does this DLC do?
[4:58:38] <%Valdorick> Hollow Knight Pat, watching the sun behind you rise, was amazing.

[4:58:46] <tanarath> Nighttime game, Pat
[4:58:46] <%DrTomT18> Watching your reactions to making new discoveries is the best part of these  streams. It's a special sort of magic only Outer Wilds can make

[4:58:56] <%Fooguwu> @jorniev it makes for forget how to play
[4:58:56] <aeonicVector> Your Disco was fantastic

[4:59:22] <%Monkeyweed21> unlike Woolie you didnt kill Klaasje
[4:59:22] <%Mr_Pylon> I'm still not sure whether I like this or Disco more.
[4:59:24] <cthulu_fearlock> you can never live up to a disc room
[4:59:27] <%razielhex> on the positive side, you're getting super good at getting that rod
[4:59:27] <%jtdobyns> what about THE ROOM
[4:59:28] <%InternetShis> Pat, say you were Isekai'd into Final Fantasy 1. What garbage music would you introduce to those medieval weirdos with your 21st century smartphone from Earth?
[4:59:28] <%Mr_Pylon> They're both brilliant
[4:59:29] <@Ranryu692> I liked the Yakuza 6 streams LUL
[4:59:33] <The_hidden_> @RayReborne disco elysium?

[5:00:46] <nomos42> When Chert was having his breakdown
[5:00:46] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Yeah you super don't notice it's amazing
[5:00:51] <Tisaric> @ZilverZap finishing the DLC adds to the ending

[5:06:02] <+RemedyofRevenge> stussy baka
[5:06:02] <ingman112> Wait is it not showing?
[5:06:03] <+jaayro> kk cool
[5:06:04] <ZE_Count> WOOO
[5:06:05] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpOmg
[5:06:06] <ingman112> Or is it blocked by pat's screen
[5:06:10] <+TombstoneTTromboners> there she blows
[5:06:11] <TrickModeX> My favorite part of watching streamers playing this game is seeing the eventual person in chat ask "when are you getting a gun"
[5:06:11] <The_hidden_> HE DID THE THING
[5:06:12] <+blaze__drag> timelimit gone
[5:06:12] <$dalmek> @PatStaresAt if you look around, you can see the signal blocker
[5:06:13] <ZE_Count> now telwport
[5:06:13] <%Buzzard42> WE IN THERE
[5:06:13] <%X2Eliah> woawoawoawoawoaw

[5:06:14] <+TombstoneTTromboners> now don't die somehow
[5:06:15] <AoiRob> yaaay
[5:06:15] <HiveMasterMind> Look for the jammer
[5:06:16] <+blaze__drag> you can see the claw
[5:06:18] <nomos42> now the other thing
[5:06:18] <waltzqueen> still cool
[5:06:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> bruh
[5:06:21] <RoughBoulder22> NOW you put itother way'
[5:06:22] <%Fooguwu> THE EYE Kreygasm
[5:06:22] <teebos> can you see the claw?
[5:06:23] <+Nahual_Amini> You can see the owl signal blocker
[5:06:24] <RyuuAoi> Scary
[5:06:24] <+Nahual_Amini> Yeah
[5:06:25] <$dalmek> it's a moving green light
[5:06:27] <leole11> what
[5:06:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> green thing right there
[5:06:28] <teebos> THERE
[5:06:28] <HeroSolaire> We Interstellar now bros
[5:06:29] <bippityjones> You have to be on the eye I think
[5:06:31] <+Nahual_Amini> From the eye
[5:06:32] <AoiRob> hey look there was the blocker
[5:06:33] <teebos> GREEN
[5:06:33] <Kosinkadink> its a green light, you can zoom with signalscope
[5:06:34] <RoughBoulder22> you can see it from on the eye IIRC
[5:06:35] <leole11> you have ALL the time in the world
[5:06:35] <@Ranryu692> your memory is like a superpower
[5:06:41] <Kosinkadink> to the left
[5:06:41] <$ArcanumArcanum> left side, use signal scope to zoom
[5:06:41] <thetntm> try using your scope
[5:06:42] <BakaTyler> Yea, they added that in the patch before the DLC came out
[5:06:42] <HiveMasterMind> top right
[5:06:43] <vVAstrAVv> LEFT
[5:06:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> look for a big green light
[5:06:50] <teebos> there
[5:06:52] <+TombstoneTTromboners> :)
[5:06:52] <%Valdorick> Rad
[5:06:53] <%SovPho> nice

[5:06:58] <nomos42> oh damn
[5:06:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> sweet
[5:07:01] <%tank7013> That's so cool
[5:07:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> those fuckers
[5:07:03] <teebos> oh shit wow
[5:07:03] <Ben_Lunaris> Black hole time, do a cannonball rbzLul
[5:07:05] <%Buzzard42> wow I missed that
[5:07:06] <thetntm> YOOOOO
[5:07:11] <%Mr_Pylon> use orb
[5:07:12] <$ArcanumArcanum> orb
[5:07:13] <leole11> through the warp
[5:07:14] <RoughBoulder22> BALL
[5:07:16] <%SovPho> move the orb
[5:07:16] <+upandadam> clip[ through wall
[5:07:17] <ZE_Count> use the thing before
[5:07:17] <%topendbuzza> ball
[5:07:18] <DigiLapin> dont forget to shoot your scout into the eye too
[5:07:18] <%Valdorick> Move the Nav ball to the other thing
[5:07:20] <+jaayro> I think a really big depressing point is how fucking CLOSE the eye actually was to our solar system the entire time
[5:07:20] <+blaze__drag> move the ball back
[5:07:20] <%SovPho> no further
[5:07:21] <tanarath> roll orb
[5:07:21] <nomos42> the other orb part
[5:07:23] <Treasure_Vault> orb to second side, then portal?
[5:07:23] <teebos> orb
[5:07:24] <ingman112> Other side of the orb
[5:07:25] <%SovPho> yuh
[5:07:34] <nomos42> now walk
[5:07:34] <CrematedCube> Wow the owlboys totally found it and said "Nah"
[5:07:39] <+blaze__drag> oh hey the quantum moon was there
[5:07:39] <MaxXtreme23> Remember to shoot your scout into the hole
[5:07:43] <+extantCadence> @TombstoneTTromboners You actually get a temporary save that  loads you back into the ending
[5:07:44] <teebos> quantum moon!
[5:07:57] <%Valdorick> Owl Boys didn't understand the Heat Death of the Universe
[5:07:58] <ingman112> This is where if you'd made a duplicate of yourself, you'd have to book it. B/c your duplicate dying in the supernova would break time
[5:07:59] <ZE_Count> you did it pat
[5:08:01] <thetntm> launch your probe into the eye when you get to it
[5:08:02] <+jaayro> @CrematedCube Yeah, it wasn't hard to find at all until they suppressed it
[5:08:07] <not_twitter_rowan> Remember to shoot the scout into the hole
[5:08:08] <+blaze__drag> don't die
[5:08:13] <jorniev> quantum bullshit
[5:08:13] <+upandadam> this is the real mystery shit
[5:08:14] <+WoodmanDotEXE> Yes
[5:08:14] <$ArcanumArcanum> quantum bullshit
[5:08:14] <%DrTomT18> It's the reset button
[5:08:15] <stoatacious> quantum
[5:08:17] <%Fooguwu> it's quantum shit bruh
[5:08:17] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's the center of the universe
[5:08:18] <ingman112> The Eye?
[5:08:18] <%derpy_platypus> quantum stuff idk
[5:08:18] <+upandadam> the one you don't learn
[5:08:19] <captain_kirkhammer> It's the eye of the universe
[5:08:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> quantum :)
[5:08:23] <+Pequod1> shrodingers universe
[5:08:24] <MartyFun11> It's a quantum planet with the most quantum activity in the entire universe
[5:08:25] <ZE_Count> nice
[5:08:25] <%sirisvirus> its the cause of the big bang
[5:08:29] <@Spydurman> quantum magic
[5:08:31] <AoiRob> its the eye of the universe :)
[5:08:33] <%topendbuzza> in the eye it went
[5:08:34] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it is ancient and unknowable
[5:08:35] <not_twitter_rowan> Raw quantum potential basically
[5:08:36] <%SovPho> it's the damascus of the universe. the melding off all into nihilistic clay
[5:08:37] <ZilverZap> lost forever to the bug succ
[5:08:39] <%tank7013> Is it not just literally the center of the universe?
[5:08:41] <%JonathLP> It's basically the nascent next universe
[5:08:45] <%razielhex> No Man's Sky ass planet
[5:08:45] <+blaze__drag> it's the source code of the universe probably
[5:08:45] <%Valdorick> its a Quantum Blackhole. Its a Blackhole, but instead of Matter, it absorbed quantum probability.
[5:08:47] <thetntm> losing your scout is important
[5:08:48] <spinningchurro> It’s god’s door into your promotion.  You’re taking his job in the next one.
[5:08:48] <%Monkeyweed21> a quantum existence that acts as a universal reset button
[5:08:49] <jorniev> yeah this bit is a lot of scary
[5:08:52] <ingman112> It's basically God, in that it founded the universe
[5:08:53] <+jaayro> It's basically a mirror of your experiences. Just like how the moon mirrored the planets it was orbiting
[5:08:55] <%jtdobyns> Maybe next DLC or game will delve more into this thing
[5:08:58] <+WoodmanDotEXE> At least it has trees
[5:08:59] <Treasure_Vault> the succc
[5:09:01] <Ben_Lunaris> It's Black Hole Nebula Moon rbzLul
[5:09:02] <%Maids4lyfe> You lost scout in the Eye last time too
[5:09:03] <tanarath> Pat. What if the Universe was alive and had an eye?
[5:09:10] <ZilverZap> not that bootleg quantum
[5:09:11] <ZE_Count> thats sick bro
[5:09:14] <ingman112> Or no, I guess the observer is God and the Eye is its instrument
[5:09:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> Don't catch a quantum virus
[5:09:19] <%DrTomT18> what about the balls of the universe?
[5:09:21] <CrematedCube> It's a point that's quantum entangled with everything else
[5:09:22] <%bassoontyphoon> God this is such nightmare fuel
[5:09:23] <%Maids4lyfe> WHY DOES GOD NEED A SPACESHIP
[5:09:25] <not_twitter_rowan> @ingman112 ayup
[5:09:25] <%Buzzard42> what if the universe was a storm and you entered its exact center?
[5:09:31] <+WoodmanDotEXE> Is Pat ready to be vored by space?
[5:09:31] <Roglef> Man this game is so cool
[5:09:45] <thetntm> I think it's more "the eye of the universe" as in "the eye of a hurricane"
[5:09:46] <%Buzzard42> it's not an eye like an eyeball, it's like the eye of the storm that is reality
[5:09:49] <+TombstoneTTromboners> run up the side
[5:09:54] <+TombstoneTTromboners> dive right in
[5:09:54] <cheapdoc> Time to 2001
[5:09:54] <%thefakeh> its like a big ol spooky butthole
[5:09:55] <RoughBoulder22> from an arm of it
[5:09:56] <HiveMasterMind> Fun fact this hole is the same size as the Quantum Moon
[5:09:58] <+TombstoneTTromboners> do a cannonball
[5:10:00] <The_hidden_> up is down
[5:10:03] <+RemedyofRevenge> mario galaxy rules apply here huh
[5:10:08] <%sporeian94> this right here is the fucking scariest goddamn thing
[5:10:11] <AoiRob> do a flip
[5:10:14] <+tomdwarf> and now some 2001 music hits us up
[5:10:14] <%Valdorick> Look at you... look... at you... you're god now.
[5:10:15] <%Fooguwu> WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[5:10:18] <%razielhex> INTERSTELLAR TIME
[5:10:18] <+extantCadence> @thefakeh And he probed it first too
[5:10:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> We're getting 5D now
[5:10:22] <RyuuAoi> Fuck this horror shit
[5:10:23] <cheapdoc> QUANTUM
[5:10:23] <%topendbuzza> a live look in to the woolie hole Kappa
[5:10:23] <%Deft_Thought> Fuck man, this is making my stomach hurt
[5:10:25] <+TombstoneTTromboners> love this part
[5:10:27] <HeroSolaire> I love interstellar
[5:10:28] <DigiLapin> read the new exihibit too
[5:10:32] <thehornypastrypuffer> ouuuuu i HATE it
[5:10:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> read things in here
[5:10:35] <spinningchurro> the eye is the quantum eternal booty the the observer is the hand that smacks it.  The resulting impact creates the next universe.
[5:10:37] <%sirisvirus> there is a new exhibit here
[5:10:37] <%HairballCT> HairballCT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 5 month streak! psaPorgmo psaDogchamp
[5:10:38] <nomos42> So Esker is god right?
[5:10:38] <thetntm> read the museum stuff
[5:10:43] <%Frost_Quill> Read new exhibit.
[5:10:47] <HiveMasterMind> Is the DLC exibit here?
[5:10:56] <AoiRob> what does the new exhibit say
[5:11:16] <%razielhex> OWLMAN
[5:11:18] <Ben_Lunaris> Time is convoluted TPFufun
[5:11:24] <%baka_sugoi> O W L
[5:11:33] <not_twitter_rowan> The Prisoner is a true Traveler
[5:11:36] <cheapdoc> Was that in the original game?
[5:11:37] <akitanito> ONE OWL
[5:11:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that owldeer saved the universe, well  the next one
[5:11:40] <%Agami23> so is this real? or is this like a psychodrama in your head?
[5:11:41] <+blaze__drag> best boi owl
[5:11:48] <%Mr_Pylon> thanks for helping out existence itself, Prisoner
[5:11:49] <not_twitter_rowan> @Agami23 yes
[5:11:51] <jorniev> what was the owl guy trying to do?
[5:11:51] <DigiLapin> @Agami23 real
[5:11:51] <%Buzzard42> the prisoner is a Cool Dude
[5:11:52] <%baka_sugoi> wow
[5:11:57] <waltzqueen> @Agami23 yes
[5:11:57] <ZE_Count> SPACCEEE
[5:12:00] <thetntm> one thing I don't like about this dlc is we never find out how the cloaking field works
[5:12:01] <@Ranryu692> are you Galactus now?
[5:12:07] <%razielhex> @Agami23 it's reality, but reality within the extremes of timespace
[5:12:07] <ingman112> At this point your psychodrama is all there is
[5:12:13] <%topendbuzza> shits gone
[5:12:19] <not_twitter_rowan> @ingman112 this, pretty much
[5:12:31] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpOmg
[5:12:35] <not_twitter_rowan> universe is fucked, the entire universe is what you are currently observing
[5:12:36] <The_hidden_> band camp
[5:12:38] <%Valdorick> The owls thought the eye was causing the end of the universe (instead of it just being natural) so in fear closed it off from the universe as it was crying out for someone to find it and recreate the unvierse.
[5:12:39] <jorniev> what was the owl prisioner trying to do?
[5:12:41] <ZE_Count> watch the stats a bit more
[5:12:41] <%razielhex> Let me sing you the song, the song of death, the song of rebirth, the song of ultimate creation.
[5:12:42] <+RemedyofRevenge> this is some men in black shit rn
[5:12:43] <+extantCadence> @Agami23 Also it's based on the perceptions of the observer, that being the player character
[5:12:45] <cthulu_fearlock> how many infinity stones you got so far?
[5:12:47] <%Maids4lyfe> all the lights are stars
[5:12:53] <%DrTomT18> Those are all Galaxies, I think
[5:12:54] <+Pequod1> time doesnt matter so much here
[5:12:54] <spinningchurro> what a great little moment this is.
[5:12:55] <ZE_Count> watch the stars
[5:12:57] <AoiRob> thats da universe
[5:12:59] <not_twitter_rowan> @Valdorick Yup. Pretty tragic, honestly
[5:13:09] <HeroSolaire> they arent stars, its all galaxies
[5:13:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> those are galaxies
[5:13:12] <Ben_Lunaris> YOU are the destroyer of all things  ShoopDaWhoop
[5:13:19] <not_twitter_rowan> All galaxies, yup
[5:13:27] <%X2Eliah> yaaaay everything is dying!
[5:13:30] <%razielhex> This is called the Degenerate Era
[5:13:31] <%Piemen99> Man I hate this part
[5:13:39] <%Piemen99> all those lights
[5:13:51] <+Pequod1> but its so beautiful tho how can you hste it
[5:13:52] <ingman112> Walk slowly here
[5:13:55] <%topendbuzza> it you
[5:13:55] <ingman112> See who it is
[5:13:57] <+TombstoneTTromboners> love this part
[5:14:01] <Tisaric> I fucking love this part, it's such a cool way of representing what is happening
[5:14:02] <not_twitter_rowan> so this is literally all that's left of the universe - it's so tiny you can see yourself in front of you
[5:14:09] <ZilverZap> monkaS
[5:14:16] <%razielhex> it's your own breath
[5:14:22] <ZE_Count> light
[5:14:22] <+bigdrifter> Im sketched tf out
[5:14:25] <Forbidden_Karp> Do not let your doppelganger defeat you
[5:14:25] <ZE_Count> flahs light pat
[5:14:26] <The_hidden_> is it guaranteed that it wasn't the Eye, but that the universe was self-destructing
[5:14:26] <Tisaric> Pat the flashlight
[5:14:28] <+Pequod1> you still exist
[5:14:28] <spinningchurro> @not_twitter_rowan excellent observation
[5:14:29] <MartyFun11> I always thought that was the player thinking "I'm all alone with myself now"
[5:14:33] <%Valdorick> Remember Pat, flash light counts as "no longer observed"
[5:14:34] <nomos42> remeber to turn your flashlight on and off to do stuff
[5:14:37] <$ArcanumArcanum> quantum rules pat
[5:14:40] <CrematedCube> Remember the quantum stuff
[5:14:44] <Ben_Lunaris> TREE POWERS ACTIVATE! 🌴
[5:14:47] <captain_kirkhammer> @razielhex two after that, this is the dark era

[5:14:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> eat marshamllows at the end of the universe
[5:14:59] <AoiRob> cromch
[5:15:02] <mr_saturday93> how the fuck are they there?
[5:15:07] <ZilverZap> cohhJam
[5:15:07] <thetntm> I believe that the universe wouldn't give birth to a new one if someone doesn't enter the eye, so in a way entering it is the most important thing
[5:15:11] <ingman112> THE LEGEND RIDES AGAIN
[5:15:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> 🪕 🪕 🪕
[5:15:13] <+Pequod1> ugh this game
[5:15:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that fuckin banjo, i love it so much
[5:15:17] <The_hidden_> the answer is quantum
[5:15:19] <nomos42> flash your light
[5:15:19] <MartyFun11> They're not there, these are reflections of the player's memories of them
[5:15:23] <+TombstoneTTromboners> remember the three tenants
[5:15:24] <AoiRob> do the quantum thing
[5:15:26] <ZE_Count> remember quantum
[5:15:28] <%Valdorick> Everything is qauntum
[5:15:29] <SelfAwareCanOpener> This last part always gets me
[5:15:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 🪕
[5:15:30] <Tisaric> I can't believe he's already completely forgot about this part
[5:15:33] <MyNameIsRasus> Flash the flashlight
[5:15:38] <not_twitter_rowan> @mr_saturday93 player character is currently god,they're essentially recreations of them based on their memories
[5:15:38] <thetntm> you gotta strobe your flashlight
[5:15:40] <%Maids4lyfe> turn your light on and off @PatStaresAt
[5:15:50] <%Piemen99> @mr_saturday93 they are who "we" want to be around for this last bit of our time
[5:15:52] <%Maids4lyfe> back away from it first
[5:15:53] <%Frost_Quill> Touching it also keeps it the same remember.
[5:15:59] <ingman112> No worries
[5:16:07] <Teras_ode> did pat also get the goat boi/gal on this run?
[5:16:18] <+TombstoneTTromboners> feldspar!

[5:26:41] <CrematedCube> At some point I realized this uses the same harmonics as the Undertale theme. The simple harmony hits hard
[5:26:49] <%JonathLP> big bang baby

[5:26:51] <+blaze__drag> big emotion

[5:27:04] <%DrTomT18> LET. THERE. BE. LIGHT!
[5:27:05] <%dekkitout> Universe 2: Elcetric Boogaloo
[5:27:06] <+RemedyofRevenge> almost as bright as when Pat checks his email
[5:27:07] <ZE_Count> you made a universe
[5:27:09] <+blaze__drag> the new universe is now owls
[5:27:10] <%Maids4lyfe> IT'S THE SONG BibleThump
[5:27:12] <ZilverZap> cohhWow
[5:27:13] <reonome> you did it
[5:27:13] <bear_breaker20> you know this could just be wrong
[5:27:14] <%Fooguwu> IN THE BEGINNING, PAT STARED AT THE UNIVERSE
[5:27:16] <+Pequod1> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[5:27:19] <+TombstoneTTromboners> The universe would have died
[5:27:19] <$Futurecity10> Entropy
[5:27:20] <ingman112> No new universe
[5:27:21] <spinningchurro> that’s what it looks like whenI bust, music included
[5:27:22] <+TombstoneTTromboners> no new big bang
[5:27:23] <Tisaric> the universe would never reset
[5:27:23] <%topendbuzza> hmm
[5:27:23] <nomos42> nothing..forever
[5:27:23] <reonome> nothing.
[5:27:25] <Visorak6> Everything just ends
[5:27:25] <not_twitter_rowan> Nothing, I think.
[5:27:25] <$ArcanumArcanum> the universe would just be dead
[5:27:25] <%Buzzard42> the universe would have died
[5:27:26] <+TombstoneTTromboners> just nothing
[5:27:26] <%cooldude69xx> @cobalt_phoenix_ If the universe is so good, where's universe 2? OH
[5:27:26] <%DrTomT18> nothing?
[5:27:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> heat death forever
[5:27:28] <stoatacious> everything dies
[5:27:28] <%Buzzard42> heat death
[5:27:28] <MyNameIsRasus> No new big bang
[5:27:28] <+blaze__drag> the hearthians are always there I think
[5:27:29] <stoatacious> the end
[5:27:30] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Decay
[5:27:30] <tanarath> A slow decay to nothing
[5:27:31] <captain_kirkhammer> Nohting. Forever.
[5:27:32] <thetntm> no new universe
[5:27:32] <Tisaric> the eye requires a conscious observer
[5:27:32] <AoiRob> ded
[5:27:33] <%Maids4lyfe> heat death
[5:27:34] <Forbidden_Karp> To bake a cake, one must first create the universe
[5:27:35] <Teras_ode> (nothing)
[5:27:36] <+TombstoneTTromboners> but you were there!!!!
[5:27:36] <Edsta94> impossible for them to not be there
[5:27:36] <+tomdwarf> The eye might not function unless there are sapient beings to do it.
[5:27:37] <%Deft_Thought> Nothing can begin without something to observe!
[5:27:37] <not_twitter_rowan> No new universe, no one to reset it.
[5:27:37] <Mr_Rakjo> Pat Stares at the big bang
[5:27:37] <cureneckbeard> don[t worry about it
[5:27:39] <FleshFriend> Clap Clap Clap
[5:27:40] <+blaze__drag> oh you mean if you never go to the eye
[5:27:41] <DigiLapin> theres an extra scene at the end
[5:27:43] <nomos42> One last detail
[5:27:43] <+blaze__drag> yeah then reality ends I guess
[5:27:44] <%thefakeh> fuck this is a good game
[5:27:45] <ZE_Count> theres a extra thing after credits
[5:27:46] <stoatacious> you can skip these credits
[5:27:47] <RoughBoulder22> @PatStaresAt I have a theory about some lore, and if I'm right it makes their story even sadder, if you'd like to hear it while the credits roll
[5:27:47] <%Mr_Pylon> And that's why the Pilot is the biggest hero ever
[5:27:48] <%Like51bears> theres one more new thing after the credits
[5:27:48] <%dekkitout> Your own little neon genesis
[5:27:49] <+JustToWatch> This and Disco Elysium are in an eternal battle for my favorite game of all time
[5:27:50] <%tank7013> Makes you wonder who was there to observe the first one
[5:27:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 100
[5:27:51] <waltzqueen> yes
[5:27:51] <leole11> yes
[5:27:52] <%TarikBot> SUPER WORTH IT
[5:27:52] <%buerdo> 1st try
[5:27:53] <%Faustgesicht> skip the credits
[5:27:53] <%X2Eliah> Hour and a half.
[5:27:53] <+blaze__drag> nope!
[5:27:53] <%DrTomT18> maybe the Eye always makes sure that there is someone there to observe the eye
[5:27:53] <%Frost_Quill> Extra scene at the end apparently.
[5:27:54] <%razielhex> GOing to see if post-credits is different?  I doubt it.
[5:27:54] <ZE_Count> yeah gave me feels
[5:27:55] <stoatacious> there's more
[5:27:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> first try
[5:27:56] <%Valdorick> And thus begins the start of Ace Combat's lore...
[5:27:56] <%Buzzard42> I fuckin FORGOT that Masi Oka was the producer on this
[5:27:56] <jorniev> YES IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY
[5:27:56] <%JonathLP> new art though
[5:27:57] <aeonicVector> BibleThump
[5:27:58] <AoiRob> new post credits scene
[5:27:59] <teebos> yes!
[5:27:59] <%DrTomT18> NO
[5:28:00] <%derpy_platypus> cry part 2
[5:28:00] <%Agami23> my guess is that the big bang would happen with no influence. no garentees of new life and no garentees for music in the world
[5:28:01] <$dalmek> yep
[5:28:02] <AoiRob> ye
[5:28:02] <not_twitter_rowan> Eye is just a knot of potential energy - a tool, useless without someone to use it
[5:28:02] <tanarath> It'd be even weirder because there are in between states with dwarfs & back holes
[5:28:02] <MyNameIsRasus> There's after  credits
[5:28:03] <%Piemen99> ABSOULTELY
[5:28:04] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe.
[5:28:04] <DigiLapin> safe to skip
[5:28:04] <+blaze__drag> but yeah new post credits
[5:28:04] <%Tearonex> Of course
[5:28:05] <%DrTomT18> THIS IS THE BEST SONG IN THE GAME
[5:28:05] <Tisaric> no way to skip
[5:28:07] <%Monkeyweed21> its a beautiful end
[5:28:07] <%G_Thunders> Post credits scene is different too
[5:28:08] <+blaze__drag> so pass some more time
[5:28:10] <stoatacious> ye
[5:28:11] <reonome> holy shit, masi oka is executive producer??
[5:28:16] <bippityjones> Gotta wait I guess
[5:28:16] <EternalJedi> limesMusic
[5:28:19] <+TombstoneTTromboners> no way to skip even unfortunately
[5:28:19] <Ben_Lunaris> You break the universe you buy it TPFufun
[5:28:20] <%Buzzard42> just sit through the credits
[5:28:21] <Tisaric> the credits are short
[5:28:21] <%JonathLP> you can watch on youtube if you miss it
[5:28:21] <Roglef> Wait is this the same Masi Oka from Heroes?
[5:28:22] <%derpy_platypus> good, song too good
[5:28:23] <AoiRob> listen to the nice music
[5:28:23] <Edsta94> unskippable because of the great track
[5:28:25] <SelfAwareCanOpener> Good music is good
[5:28:25] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's such a good game
[5:28:27] <jorniev> this song is good anyway
[5:28:28] <stoatacious> thoughts on the dlc?
[5:28:28] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i love this game so much
[5:28:29] <ingman112> YEP
[5:28:31] <ZE_Count> said somthing about new thing from the pgone
[5:28:33] <ingman112> Same Masi Oka
[5:28:35] <masterfire23> Masi oki of heroes fame
[5:28:39] <Tisaric> yeah thoughts on the DLC?
[5:28:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> appreciate these people while you wait
[5:28:46] <%DrTomT18> this is one of the most beautiful sons ever written
[5:28:46] <%razielhex> give it up for Andrew Prahlow and Kelsey Beachum
[5:28:47] <AoiRob> im still emotional ;w;
[5:28:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @Roglef yea
[5:28:48] <reonome> @Roglef yes
[5:28:49] <Roglef> Dang. That's crazy
[5:28:50] <bippityjones> Ok so in the credits they credit the DLC vocal choir poeple as "Elk Choir" so I guess the Strangers are called Elks???
[5:28:54] <thetntm> final thoughts on dlc?
[5:28:54] <%SovPho> it's not a sequel
[5:28:56] <%SovPho> it's a prequel
[5:29:00] <%Valdorick> Facts LUL
[5:29:00] <Tisaric> yup totally agree
[5:29:03] <cheapdoc> The possibility of the universe having started because someone from the previous one observed it ... hopeful? yeah
[5:29:03] <%X2Eliah> SequelC
[5:29:04] <bippityjones> Sequel/Prequel
[5:29:07] <ZE_Count> Its a giant side quest to the main game
[5:29:08] <DigiLapin> mini sequel
[5:29:08] <tanarath> Prequel
[5:29:11] <+Pequod1> its kinda bolted on but its still so good
[5:29:11] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Arnt those the best
[5:29:14] <%DrTomT18> It's amazing
[5:29:14] <%Mr_Pylon> I like that it fills in the question of why the Eye stopped calling out
[5:29:16] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's an expansion pack
[5:29:17] <%jtdobyns> It mainly just an extension of the base game
[5:29:17] <+TombstoneTTromboners> a real one
[5:29:18] <%topendbuzza> prequel?
[5:29:18] <%Fooguwu> How does it feel Pat? To have stared a universe into being
[5:29:22] <KasiCrafter> Back in my day, we just called those "Expansion Packs"
[5:29:22] <%TarikBot> The Squeakual
[5:29:25] <%DrTomT18> Bethesda did that with the Shivering Isle
[5:29:27] <+tomdwarf> I mean, kind of. Its more like a side campaign. It explains stuff that happened even before the nomai, and why they had such problems finding the eye.
[5:29:29] <Tisaric> it kind of HAD to be bolted on
[5:29:31] <AoiRob> cant wait for their next work. they're amazing
[5:29:31] <%Buzzard42> it's extremely bolted on, but in a really good way
[5:29:33] <%Tearonex> pre-sequel?
[5:29:35] <%razielhex> back in the day this would have been called an "Expansion pack"
[5:29:36] <$Shaggy2124> If there's one aspect of games I feel should always be on point is music. Conveys emotion so well and this game nails it
[5:29:38] <thetntm> do you think new players should try to do the dlc while doing the main game?
[5:29:44] <HeroSolaire> Its like civilization brand new world expansion pack like I read on kotaku
[5:29:47] <%derpy_platypus> it relies on some in universe knowledge
[5:29:49] <Explodincatz> the stealth sections were terrible
[5:29:50] <Ben_Lunaris> @PatStaresAt Prequel to the sequel of the game that causes an infinite loop of Universe creation and destruction
[5:29:51] <$ArcanumArcanum> ELK CHOIR
[5:30:03] <leole11> idk why people hated the stealth sections lmao
[5:30:10] <+jaayro> It's a prequel that runs concurrently to a game that's about the future
[5:30:12] <+blaze__drag> I think that the way it's designed you're probably gonna do the stranger last anyways
[5:30:16] <+blaze__drag> it's the hardest thing to find
[5:30:16] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[5:30:17] <Tisaric> btw that's not the name of the species, that's a literal choir of elk
[5:30:23] <+TombstoneTTromboners> because they're BAD AT VIDEO GAMES
[5:30:27] <HeroSolaire> People forget there are also stealth sections in Dark Bramble
[5:30:28] <DigiLapin> the stealth sections dont even need to happen if you just have good timing
[5:30:30] <waltzqueen> There's a new Dedication at the end. BibleThump
[5:30:31] <Tisaric> They went and recorded an elk family for some of the music/sfx
[5:30:32] <%Frost_Quill> @leole11 People impatient.
[5:30:32] <%Buzzard42> the stealth sections stand out because they're TERRIFYING
[5:30:41] <%DrTomT18> It's not Outlast
[5:30:41] <AoiRob> they're SUPER HARD
[5:30:45] <%DrTomT18> basically
[5:30:48] <leole11> ah fair, i really enjoyed them :)
[5:30:49] <IHaveNoFunnyName> You can skip all of the stealth sections, or at least make them not scary at all, if you know about the simulation bubble
[5:30:50] <Treasure_Vault> Because stealth without a grappling hook is WEAK
[5:30:50] <%Valdorick> They're not even spooky. They literally just spend your clock.
[5:30:52] <$ArcanumArcanum> Problem with the stealth sections is you can't see where the owls are until they see you
[5:30:53] <akitanito> because there's really only one way to do it
[5:30:53] <tanarath> It's hard for some to understand how to stealth & the lantern fucked with visibility a LOT
[5:30:54] <AoiRob> and you cant see shit
[5:30:54] <%Buzzard42> also yes the stealth sections are fuckin HARD
[5:30:56] <captain_kirkhammer> The stealth sections would be fair if the elks always had their lanterns out
[5:30:56] <bippityjones> Fig
[5:30:57] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it hurts
[5:31:02] <%topendbuzza> moon*
[5:31:05] <thetntm> the problem with the stealth sections is a lack of ability to tell where the enemies are combined with a lack of options to deal with them
[5:31:06] <+jaayro> It hurts so bad
[5:31:08] <cheapdoc> Good thing they had an option to put the stealth sections in baby mode
[5:31:09] <reonome> good job idiots
[5:31:09] <%cvp5127> lmao
[5:31:10] <SelfAwareCanOpener> Hurts a lot
[5:31:10] <Explodincatz> Dark Bramble isnt even close to the dream stealth sections
[5:31:13] <IHaveNoFunnyName> You only do the stealth sections if you like banging your head into them and don't go elsewhere and come back with more knowledge
[5:31:14] <vVAstrAVv> once you learn the "hacks" the slealth sections can be like 4 5ths skipped
[5:31:15] <%topendbuzza> homemoon
[5:31:18] <$dalmek> and then finding out why the VR realm looks the way it does
[5:31:18] <teebos> ouchie
[5:31:18] <waltzqueen> the biggest mistake ever
[5:31:20] <%DrTomT18> and then they blocked the only thing that could save the universe
[5:31:22] <+jaayro> They dead their ENTIRE planet to go see something that just told them "you're all gonna die"
[5:31:26] <cthulu_fearlock> dumbo thick
[5:31:26] <$dalmek> it's the home they lost
[5:31:27] <$ArcanumArcanum> @IHaveNoFunnyName you don't naturally learn about the bubble until you get through one of the sections. You also need to get through them all with a lantern at least once
[5:31:27] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Its like you meet god and he sucks
[5:31:30] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, the fact that they ruined their fucking homeworld to find out something, and hated it, is A REAL TOUGH PILL TO SWALLOW.
[5:31:31] <CrematedCube> That part totally made their rage and anger make sense
[5:31:34] <AoiRob> they couldnt bear the hold the L
[5:31:37] <not_twitter_rowan> @DrTomT18 yeah, but they didn't know that
[5:31:37] <%Frost_Quill> @thetntm But you do get the ability to see where they are once you learn how.
[5:31:39] <%Valdorick> "Oh man, the EYE is going kill us all" "No bro, I need you to observe me so I can create a new universe" "But that requires killing everything!"
[5:31:40] <%DrTomT18> THIS PART
[5:31:46] <cureneckbeard> What effect does the no-scary option have
[5:31:49] <+jaayro> I managed to discover the matrix hack thing early on, and it kind of trivializes the stealth parts
[5:31:55] <%tank7013> What the knowledge of how to do better?
[5:31:55] <%Agami23> you should absolutely look up the ash twin paradox they added in when you have time.
[5:31:55] <ZE_Count> god I love the music
[5:31:56] <%Buzzard42> yeah learning they'd destroyed their planet to reach the eye made everything make sense
[5:32:00] <RoughBoulder22> the prisoner said outright they wanted to live forever, and the eye was the proof they couldn't, that it will end
[5:32:05] <bear_breaker20> thank you playtesters jesus christ
[5:32:06] <$ArcanumArcanum> @cureneckbeard slows down owl move speed so you can outrun them, trivializes the stealth
[5:32:07] <thetntm> there are some unavoidable ones
[5:32:07] <bippityjones> Oh yeah I figured that out by looking at the art of those places on the station and seeing they're all on a planet, so with all the natural shit on their ship I figured they had to at least RIP CHUNKS OUT of their planet to build that thing.
[5:32:07] <%razielhex> wow look at all those testers for the DLC
[5:32:08] <%derpy_platypus> stealth parts guard THE vital knowledge
[5:32:08] <BakaTyler> I like the Stealth sections. They're simple and easy to figure out, and you can even skip the entirety of the stealth if you're clever enough
[5:32:10] <leole11> the one in the canyon you can super cheese, the invisible platform leads you past the bridge you need to spawn
[5:32:12] <Lucreto> two out of the 3 areas can have the owl guys vanish from the water destroying their flames
[5:32:13] <cheapdoc> Couldn't you just wait for all of them to die?
[5:32:14] <+blaze__drag> the debug mode helps the stealth parts a lot
[5:32:15] <tanarath> There's other ways to do the stealth, apparently?
[5:32:19] <+blaze__drag> you can scout super easy and plan your path
[5:32:19] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt do you think 2019 deserves to be in consideration for one of the greatest years in video games solely for this and Disco Elysium?
[5:32:23] <IHaveNoFunnyName> @IHaveNoFunnyName I did not do a single stealth section
[5:32:25] <CrematedCube> Yeah, on or off stream the time nonsense is very fun
[5:32:26] <%Piemen99> if they just taken their time ,if only they just took their time to find something else to make their ship out of
[5:32:27] <KasiCrafter> What threw me for a loop is that their eternal life deal was an ACCIDENT
[5:32:32] <waltzqueen> in memory of Oom Erwin
[5:32:37] <%Mr_Pylon> Also 2019 had Hypnospace
[5:32:38] <buhbuhboat> stealth sections are pretty tough, but they give you the option to turn them off basically so its not an issue imo
[5:32:39] <thetntm> the 2nd one only works at the very end of the loop
[5:32:40] <%DrTomT18> INDIE GAMES WIN AGAIN
[5:32:40] <%Buzzard42> like no shit you're furious, you found out meeting God destroys the universe, and you can't even go home again because your world is a smoldering pile of ashes
[5:32:40] <%Zundelle> I didn't like the stealth sections because it felt like I was trial and erroring stuff in pitch black darkness half the time and it killed the atmosphere and made it seem goofy
[5:32:43] <bippityjones> oh god it's been 2 years
[5:32:45] <%razielhex> Jump to 14,300,000,000 years
[5:32:49] <%UberKingKai> Like 3 times more testers for dlc
[5:32:55] <tanarath> And Hades
[5:32:57] <%tank7013> The easy way to do the stealth is revealed to you after a stealth section and you can't do it because you need the relic
[5:32:57] <bippityjones> This was around before but now it's got more stuff
[5:33:04] <+blaze__drag> DMC5 was also 2019
[5:33:05] <%baka_sugoi> wow
[5:33:06] <+dj_mixd> 2019 was Death Stranding too LUL
[5:33:07] <vVAstrAVv> @cheapdoc the lowlands ones die early enough but the tower ones die right at the end and the gorge ones never do
[5:33:08] <%razielhex> TIME IS CYCLICAL BABY
[5:33:09] <+TombstoneTTromboners> :)
[5:33:10] <%Buzzard42> the stealth section is easy because you just have to do a dry run with the lights on
[5:33:11] <Kamayanna> What's funny is that mainstream gaming was all like "2019 was a shit year huh" and could only name Sekiro as their kinda thing
[5:33:12] <cthulu_fearlock> WHAT A TIME JUMP!
[5:33:12] <%Valdorick> I hope this is the bird people of this universe finding the eye this time.
