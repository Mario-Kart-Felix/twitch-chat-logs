[0:19:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat has a Tom Clancy nightvision mug
[0:19:41] <sumrand0> hitman 2 is great, the "new" hitman 3 adds some cool looking levels but without adding any substantial new gear/gadgets/weapons I'm kinda disappointed since multiple runs per map is fun/fine but not adding new items feels like the level-specific rewards are underwhelming rewards for progression

[0:28:58] <%Bmrandfriends> fam
[0:28:59] <%BoxNavy> and all the horrible goblin people left
[0:28:59] <UltimateDomon> Burning bridges with family members feels so cathartic
[0:28:59] <+AugustRei> fuck em is my personal policy
[0:29:00] <Broken_Sonex> Okay bye
[0:29:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IS IT BASED?
[0:29:03] <%Monkeyweed21> My cousin just got arrested after his crazy bitch wife called the cops on him and made up a bunch of bullshit, so thats fun
[0:29:07] <%Vibe__Lord> TRUE
[0:29:07] <%Frost_Quill> If you stick around after burning that bridge you could end up going down with it.

[0:29:48] <skyentombment> Everyone here saying "Yeah, fuck our family, those toxic shits" and I'm sitting here thinking none of my family is mean to me or bad, so I might be the one they cut off for being a weirdo
[0:29:52] <Jontman42> my cousins did a nice thing and cut themselves off of other family by going to prison
[0:29:54] <%Bmrandfriends> that man lives in a mansion

They've subscribed for 47 months! interview went well, even got a second interview with a panel including the owner of the company was supposed to hear back yesterday even if it was a no, only for no call to happen, I'm going to try to follow up tomorrow just in case something happened

[0:30:34] <deecomposer> shes a little cringe
[0:30:43] <Broken_Sonex> And your bro is a fuck
[0:30:47] <%Frost_Quill> My family is boring, I think the most exciting thing in the last few years was my grandpa being salty for like a day after my dad adopted 2 cats without telling anyone.
[0:30:47] <Sunstalker> And you have the goblins
[0:30:48] <WillyFresh992> thats rough buddy
[0:30:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> My dad's got anger problems sometimes and my mom's super ditzy but overall they're super chill
[0:30:53] <%BoxNavy> feels good when all the assholes in your family fucked off and everyone left is chill B)
[0:30:54] <+bugz_munny> my brother and dad can BURN
[0:30:54] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat's aunt is FOINE
[0:30:58] <Madovir> I cut a whole friend group for calling me "one of the good ones" after saying white men need to be culled
[0:30:58] <Saltmeisterr> my dad sucks booty
[0:31:00] <majindusto> Fine?
[0:31:01] <dukenux> Mediocre
[0:31:05] <+PikeBot> I've heard you talk so much shit about your brother with no details so I'm basically imagining him as the Grinch
[0:31:06] <Zeikier> my friends have siblings i've never seen before and it's weird
[0:31:07] <%Movemeister> Kreygasm
[0:31:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Dakuu75 Theres a massive double standard there XD Anyone can do that. Its called having shitty police and courts

[0:31:37] <+vaderxyz1970> Who was the most evil?
[0:31:39] <%ssjklyco> How evil?
[0:31:39] <%sniffy77> dead and evil, so theyre devils
[0:31:39] <%BoxNavy> you have a circus cousin
[0:31:39] <%SirGO0SE> is that new lore?
[0:31:43] <%BoxNavy> he might be evil
[0:31:45] <Sunstalker> The circus circus or the fancy circus?
[0:31:46] <+thecosmicfly> So you're either evil, or you're in the circus
[0:31:47] <Sol_Install> how's that going cause circus busniess been kinda DEAD tbh
[0:31:49] <trickquestionz> When you think about it, most of everyone's family is either dead or evil
[0:31:50] <nivlac_555> de soliel?
[0:31:50] <%GarbageNirvana> It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that a good part of my family's pretty fucked up

[0:32:00] <dukenux> *family
[0:32:02] <+Fooguwu> is that like "the farm" for family?
[0:32:03] <dynamic_funk> cut ties with my step bro for being at the capital riots
[0:32:04] <Crunkle_Dunkle> carnevil
[0:32:05] <%Bmrandfriends> i cant believe circuses still exist
[0:32:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat is part carny.
[0:32:08] <rufus2k2> I don't believe you
[0:32:08] <dukenux> nice
[0:32:11] <trickquestionz> BACKFLIPPED OVER BERLINE WALL
[0:32:12] <%jnoble919> What’s his circus gimmick??
[0:32:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Straight outta South Park
[0:32:17] <%JoshManVGH> My father seemed to have no interest in raising me, or the capability to take responsibility for any of his own decisions. so I haven't talked to him since I was like a freshman in highscool. probably one of the best decisions I ever made.
[0:32:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did she have 5 identical twins?
[0:32:25] <dukenux> Those that don't use animals are cool
[0:32:26] <ShineTheDiamond> My circus cousin (sword swallower) met a fire breather and fell in love.
[0:32:26] <%Bmrandfriends> yea was
[0:32:29] <%BoxNavy> yo thats awesome
[0:32:30] <Jontman42> circus isn't really what it used to be (in a good way)'
[0:32:31] <%Monkeyweed21> I worked with a bunch of Montreal people on Cirque De Sol
[0:32:32] <Zeikier> my family actually have normal conversations during holidays but one uncle is kind of a whiny baby
[0:32:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Actual shit?
[0:32:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> People circus is fine, animal circus bad
[0:32:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> As a quarter Ukranian chick here... UKRANIAN CHICKS ARE FUCKING HOT
[0:32:34] <%Mr_Pylon> cool
[0:32:34] <%SirGO0SE> that kicks ass

[0:32:40] <deecomposer> pat youre a circus cousin too its just online
[0:32:41] <+Deko_> sounds cool
[0:32:41] <%SirGO0SE> circus cousin rules
[0:32:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Super Juggler
[0:32:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> the Cirque isn't a real circus.
[0:32:44] <Madovir> have you seen combat juggling? i it's the best sport
[0:32:44] <%jnoble919> DOPE
[0:32:50] <%BoxNavy> cus hes at the circus
[0:32:51] <%toolofparanoia> I have two family members that are estranged to me, One my cousin who is staunch libertarian and told my other cousin, his brother to take down his BLM post during the protests, and that cousin for giving into him

[1:00:11] <%thetrashman_sc> its ok
[1:00:12] <unionyoshi> Straight to italy

[1:00:13] <Butthole_Magilliacutty> SOSA FOR THE WIN
[1:00:13] <%MisterRockett> Do it all
[1:00:14] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You gotta hit the man
[1:00:14] <+brightman42> it's alright but not required
[1:00:15] <%BoxNavy> no1care -_-
[1:00:16] <%OfficerMods> yes
[1:00:16] <%MrUnKnownAlien> hitman has lore lol
[1:00:17] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Tried playing FFXIV free trial with a friend, but couldn't party up which killed our motivation to play. Is it only good as a single player experience if none of your friends have a subscription to the game?
[1:00:18] <%MrMegaJackpots> it's not good
[1:00:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> Really tho
[1:00:19] <%OfficerMods> aw
[1:00:20] <trickquestionz> Its good in the sense that it doesn't matter
[1:00:21] <%AzureGale> psaBig psaWrong
[1:00:21] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> you are John Hitman
[1:00:22] <+Octopicake> Lol
[1:00:22] <%DrunkenDice> story? meh lytWIPED
[1:00:23] <+mel0dica> i cares
[1:00:24] <%ChubbyPencil> They force you to in 3
[1:00:25] <dukenux> i care :(
[1:00:27] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Who EVER cared about Hitman story?
[1:00:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Sapienza is better than the entire overarching plot
[1:00:28] <%BoxNavy> its like the story in doom
[1:00:29] <DeoxysPrime> It's basically incomprehensible in the first game
[1:00:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> They kidnapped your priest dad
[1:00:30] <%sumrand0> Blood Money had the BEST story
[1:00:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> No one cares that you like it tho LUL
[1:00:31] <%AzureGale> Giant Bomb cares
[1:00:32] <%BoxNavy> who care
[1:00:36] <jorniev> LOOSE THREAD OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE MURDERED
[1:00:37] <+PikeBot> I care that unlike Absolution it stays out of the way and just servers as an excuse to run around the world Hitting Mans
[1:00:37] <rafaelba93> its shit but fine
[1:00:39] <%Alazull> It's a decent story but they were smart not to make the mistake of Absolution again
[1:00:40] <trickquestionz> The perfect Hitman story is one that gives you good targets but you don't have to care about.
[1:00:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> Murder is the richest story there is
[1:00:42] <%FluffiTamamo> I wonder how much of the environment he loots. nyannSmug
[1:00:42] <+RealPT1> George of Super Bunnyhop might have some words about the story
[1:00:42] <+brightman42> the downgrading on the cutscenes as the games progress is kinda hilarious
[1:00:46] <justindgbz> The story is good
[1:00:47] <%Bt_Robot> Do you have the Sean Bean mission?
[1:00:47] <waffleandman> i thought you were gonna play old hitman 2
[1:00:48] <%PaladinDupre> BIG MURDER
[1:00:49] <+Javaa01> The story primarily kicks in near the end of 2 and then 3, the first set of levels is just a lot of setup for the story
[1:00:53] <%AzureGale> I like how they tried to make Diana sound younger for these missions
[1:00:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's just 2 minute cutscenes inbetween 40 minutes of murder sneakums
[1:01:05] <%Frost_Quill> I like understanding and wanting to kill the targets for whatever awful thing they did.
[1:01:05] <+Kataiser> There's a funny easter egg on this map where if you act like a weirdo the actors start talking about how you're the hitman
[1:01:06] <+Carquar> The helicopter cracked me up
[1:01:09] <Broken_Sonex> The story is that you are a bald man who hits other man.
[1:01:14] <%BoxNavy> its pretend :)
[1:01:14] <%Dakuu75> Matrix training program
[1:01:14] <soflicar> This game quailifised for Carmack's quote
[1:01:16] <jorniev> WHO SET THIS UP?
[1:01:18] <%linSP> do a real murder
[1:01:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wanna know the story behind Hitman's bald-ass head
[1:01:25] <%JeanGStreams> oh god I never looked up this entire mission
[1:01:28] <+xmetalicdemonx> I want to get into this game but don't they have timed events that dissappear if you take to long?
[1:01:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> @soflicar Suck it down?
[1:01:30] <%PaladinDupre> this looks very Russian
[1:01:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Turtleneck powers
[1:01:39] <%fishmonger555> so excited for their Bond game ;-;
[1:01:40] <%SvenHolgersson> Suck it Peter
[1:01:43] <arduousScavenger> @jorniev Abstergo
[1:01:44] <+Walopoh> Yeah because he's an APEX MPREDATOR
[1:01:44] <Wan6Saber> wow
[1:01:45] <%SvenHolgersson> Hitman got you beat
[1:01:47] <+Darkrenai> Secrettraining pit
[1:01:48] <+brightman42> same for the second tutorial level I think
[1:01:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> I also never looked up
[1:01:51] <ExpressNode> Pitboss
[1:01:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Go hit the man
[1:01:54] <ConorIsOnTwitchNow> why does every game need x vision
[1:01:54] <%AzureGale> All the weapons emit smoke in this mission lol
[1:01:54] <+gimmickypizza> I never looked up
[1:01:56] <+Walopoh> PLEASE DO
[1:02:00] <+MugenSandan> Bald men NOT ALLOWED
[1:02:00] <%thetrashman_sc> YEAH DO IT
[1:02:01] <+brightman42> yes please
[1:02:01] <+Giggalith> It's the fashion police
[1:02:02] <%BoxNavy> thatd be cool
[1:02:03] <dukenux> Yes
[1:02:03] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Oh hey for the clarity of the stream so that people don't ask what difficulty this is on, you can go set difficulty display on in the HUD settings
[1:02:04] <%sumrand0> @javaa01 story in Blood Money definitely starts slow but the important bit is that the story NAILS the ending. I freaked out during the last missiom/credit sequence hahaha
[1:02:05] <%SvenHolgersson> No Archer cosplays allowed
[1:02:05] <spacecatstreams> literally perfect for that
[1:02:05] <+AugustRei> i'd love to see more hitman
[1:02:07] <%AzureGale> Manhit is GREAT
[1:02:07] <%Monkeyweed21> its a great stream game
[1:02:08] <+Walopoh> Jerma streamed the whole trilogy and it was a blast
[1:02:09] <+AugustRei> there's so much you can do and so many levels
[1:02:09] <%Mr_Pylon> hell yeah, Hitman rules
[1:02:14] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt A missle silo. Also I think my favorite thing is the speakers around the boat playing sea sounds.
[1:02:14] <%a_goth_pancake> I'm down for that
[1:02:15] <lastexile95> yes please
[1:02:15] <+thecosmicfly> Funny how many people don't realise this is all a fake set with actors. People think it's an actual boat
[1:02:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah there's a lot of content in these games
[1:02:17] <GRIMMSORA> Please that would be great!
[1:02:20] <Laecerelius> Jerma's streams of this were great
[1:02:21] <dukenux> Pls do it(althout Codename 47 would be rought)
[1:02:36] <NitronStreams> Most people are not as used to having to look up at things as Pat is.
[1:02:38] <arduousScavenger> "Don't worry, he wasn't married."
[1:02:42] <+Walopoh> WOW
[1:02:44] <+Darkrenai> No one has ever done this
[1:02:45] <+brightman42> you can also have a silent assassin hud indicator if you care
[1:02:45] <+Darkrenai> EVER
[1:02:47] <%AzureGale> "You're such a dick, hitman." "You're such a hit, dickman."
[1:02:49] <jorniev> WHAT
[1:02:56] <dukenux> oh my goood, this is the first hitmanning hitman did
[1:03:01] <%Blank9> they said it couldn't be done
[1:03:02] <%thetrashman_sc> NO ONE HAS EVER DONE THAT
[1:03:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> No ones ever tried that before
[1:03:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> He's a regular Scarlet Pimpernel
[1:03:04] <arduousScavenger> "Is it possible to learn this power?"
[1:03:04] <+thecosmicfly> The 90s were a different time
[1:03:06] <%AncelDeLambert> he's a Disguisi
[1:03:08] <rafaelba93> suit only tho
[1:03:08] <%thetrashman_sc> KomodoHype
[1:03:09] <Broken_Sonex> IT'S HIS STAND
[1:03:09] <%JoshManVGH> But no wig. Huh.
[1:03:10] <dukenux> NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW
[1:03:12] <+mel0dica> cuz bald so he can be anybody
[1:03:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat killing people again
[1:03:16] <%Frost_Quill> That's legit, people often see uniform instead of faces.
[1:03:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt is he turtly enough for the Turtle Club?
[1:03:17] <+BigDumBeak> canon that all OTHER hitmat they employ just sneak around with a gun and NEVER tried to just be a clown or barber smh
[1:03:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @AzureGale He raised Phil and loves the ladies
[1:03:20] <%chiazam> HE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THAT GUY
[1:03:23] <ARDM112> Well realistically no hired killer would try to put on clothes from some guy he just knocked out on-site
[1:03:24] <+Ninjamaninjas> It's called innovation Pat!
[1:03:24] <+MugenSandan> Diana just doesn't know what happened in MGS3 cause she wasn't born yet and it's even more secret
[1:03:28] <trickquestionz> His ability is flawlessly disguising himself wherever he goes despite being a 6 foot 2 bald white guy with no accent.
[1:03:31] <jorniev> HITMAN HAS TIME POWERS
[1:03:34] <Brickston> you pull out one massive rifle and everyone freaks out
[1:03:37] <dukenux> @chiazam shut up tho
[1:03:42] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:03:45] <%linSP> Did you see harry partridges animation on hitman
[1:03:47] <%AncelDeLambert> he uses the Force
[1:03:49] <%sumrand0> aka the department manager
[1:03:49] <+brightman42> I know all the guards in the world!
[1:03:50] <PinkDaydreamer> yo thats lit
[1:03:51] <%MoguManda> he's the most generic looking human, so he fits in most places
[1:03:52] <%alcors_wisdom> i think the first thing invented by murderers is hitting people with rocks
[1:03:52] <BioApple> "people tend to see uniforms, not faces" *disguises as a celebrity like two weeks later*
[1:03:54] <+Walopoh> Put on a chef costume and nobody realizes you are the only caucasian chef in the middle of mainland China LUL
[1:03:56] <%AncelDeLambert> share coffee
[1:04:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> the first one she fucked up
[1:04:13] <dukenux> This 6ft tall bald man with a tattoo on the back of his head can fit perfectly anywhere
[1:04:14] <%whyskeywolfe> She just needs a little trial run.
[1:04:20] <+thecosmicfly> God, flashbacks to Absolution where ALL people in the same outfit knew each other
[1:04:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> I saw a vid where former CIA talked about quick changes. Intereting stuff
[1:04:30] <%Frost_Quill> I play with the floating icons off.
[1:04:33] <%linSP> just GLASS HIM
[1:04:34] <%AzureGale> THAT is your target
[1:04:34] <%Alazull> It still gets pretty hilarious. You can disguise yourself as people who have distinctive looks and the target knows with no problem
[1:04:36] <%linSP> and RUN
[1:04:36] <+brightman42> his bodyguard looks like 47
[1:04:40] <%thetrashman_sc> THAT
[1:04:44] <%MoguManda> this is also the perfect level to teach you about how levels are stacked on each other
[1:04:49] <%weissguard> LUL
[1:04:50] <popedjoker> @thecosmicfly god ABSOLUTION IS SO BAD
[1:04:54] <arduousScavenger> Make out with his bodyguard to earn his trust.
[1:04:58] <%MisterRockett> I'm so glad they did this after the trainwreck of a disguise system the on in Absolution was.
[1:04:58] <Wan6Saber> good music athM
[1:04:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> The disguises do get a little hard to believe when you're in like Dubai or Malaysia to be fair
[1:05:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> What about the CIA biolumniscence project?
[1:05:03] <jorniev> LOL
[1:05:04] <dukenux> LUL
[1:05:05] <Strider222> do all these people know they're roleplaying for a super killer training program?
[1:05:11] <+mel0dica> m'guard
[1:05:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> not for the plebs
[1:05:13] <Zeikier> *tips hat* m'target
[1:05:15] <jorniev> WHERE IS THE KANE AND LYCH CAMEO PAT?

[1:05:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> (Tips Fedora) "M' Urder"
[1:05:23] <%DrunkenDice> lytOUCH
[1:05:24] <%PaladinDupre> LUL
[1:05:25] <+brightman42> that worked out better
[1:05:27] <%BoxNavy> its gonna be weird watching someone thats not a maniac like jerma stream this game
[1:05:28] <dukenux> Good that they didn't follow ith that
[1:05:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:05:30] <%thetrashman_sc> i love how he has the bandages
[1:05:32] <+brightman42> he didn't witness you
[1:05:32] <%AzureGale> You should throw more fire extinguishers
[1:05:34] <+Walopoh> The missions in Asia are hilarious because HOW do they not notice the only white guy in the building
[1:05:42] <ARDM112> His head is bandaged from all the tutorials LUL
[1:05:44] <Samurai_Jake> I HEARD THAT
[1:05:44] <TheNewJapanGuy> Oh man I LOVE throwing shit at people in this game LUL
[1:05:47] <%PaladinDupre> chill
[1:05:49] <%AzureGale> Prop wrenches
[1:05:49] <primarch_lupercal> these poor actors @patstaresat
[1:05:50] <dukenux> Naked in a freezer. he'll be fine
[1:05:51] <%weissguard> She's loving this
[1:05:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> THAT GUY IS DEAD
[1:05:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does that dude have a huge bandage on his face because his job is to get hit with a fucking wrench?
[1:05:54] <popedjoker> hey do you know about the Silent Assassin hud?
[1:05:54] <+Walopoh> Pat, he is APEX PREDATOR
[1:05:55] <+MugenSandan> IT ISNT?
[1:05:55] <jorniev> HE JUST SAW YOU
[1:05:58] <+chocoborb> no one noticed the huge barcode tattoo tho, makes sense LUL
[1:05:59] <%Dakuu75> she's yucking it up and loving every minute of it
[1:06:04] <TheNewJapanGuy> Especially blueberry muffins
[1:06:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Imagine being an actor on this
[1:06:07] <dukenux> Diana always had hots for mr Bald
[1:06:09] <%thetrashman_sc> @ReallyBigRocks yup LUL
[1:06:12] <%chiazam> She's really into it
[1:06:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I mean you literally changed thru 2 disguises and infiltrated the yacht in a minute
[1:06:16] <%Mr_Pylon> He's suspicious of The Help not working
[1:06:20] <%sumrand0> Stealthy unnoticed assassinations are ideal but honestly fuck that, a sniper shot from far off is always fun
[1:06:21] <dukenux> Will He Blend
[1:06:27] <himbearbedtime> bro i'm blended
[1:06:27] <Laecerelius> Oh no! His face is hidden by standing right there!
[1:06:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> initiate
[1:06:28] <%chiazam> Who looks at the help
[1:06:28] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt He doesn't know why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch
[1:06:29] <jorniev> would nemesis system work with this game?
[1:06:31] <+bugz_munny> barcode what barcode
[1:06:33] <ape_hawk> just like the terrible Adam Sandler movie
[1:06:36] <%BoxNavy> STOP blending in
[1:06:38] <+Figleafplays> he just has a barcode on the back of his head and no one questions it.
[1:06:38] <+Kataiser> 47 is a very, very good actor in these games. He's shockingly good at a lot of ridiculous things
[1:06:40] <+Walopoh> jermaThing
[1:06:44] <+Deko_> LUL
[1:06:45] <%alcors_wisdom> are there even any lethal weapons on this map?
[1:06:45] <%twoto858> So are these actors or AI
[1:06:47] <+Figleafplays> tbh for some reason that bothers the fuck out of me
[1:06:47] <%AzureGale> PAIGE-UH
[1:06:48] <%Dakuu75> @chocoborb wow, it's not even on his neck, it's on the back of his balled-ass-head like a billboard
[1:06:48] <Sunstalker> kinamaHappyW He's so overt it's covert
[1:06:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Does he know why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch
[1:06:49] <%TheWinged7> Paaaaaigeeee-uh
[1:06:50] <Coystick> "OH WAITRESS!"
[1:06:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> third coffee
[1:06:56] <+Javaa01> She's putting the rat poison in the coffee RIGHT NOW
[1:06:57] <Giztech> don't breath this
[1:06:57] <%SvenHolgersson> MAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHM
[1:06:58] <%Frost_Quill> Sniping the Paris mission in a minute is always super fun no matter how often I do it.
[1:07:01] <%SvenHolgersson> GIMME SNACKS
[1:07:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> woman bring me coffee
[1:07:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> I want a Love Coffee. I need to get me a spouse.
[1:07:07] <Broken_Sonex> @Kataiser It's expected of a Man who Hits
[1:07:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait so these all actors who know there's a spy onboard?
[1:07:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Kataiser Never changes his voice even slightly though. Always sounds like a deadpan killer
[1:07:15] <popedjoker> pat's lookin to shit himself with all the coffee lol
[1:07:15] <+Walopoh> 47 is trained to be a MASTER at every possible profession, I love it
[1:07:16] <arduousScavenger> @ape_hawk Where's the ten minute sequence where they rave about how great this vacation service is?
[1:07:21] <ape_hawk> did she give you a coffee enema?
[1:07:26] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:07:28] <+BigDumBeak> she's done this BEFORE
[1:07:36] <Coystick> Brrrrrrrrr
[1:07:38] <%Dakuu75> BRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:07:38] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> BRRRRRR

[1:07:45] <+Walopoh> BRRR
[1:07:46] <+thecosmicfly> Drilling?
[1:07:48] <ARDM112> Honestly there's a very easy and neat way to introduce a second character. Have it be a woman. Same map, 47 gets to change into all the guys, new character gets to change into all the girls. Two different ways to play, and no dumb gimmicks.
[1:07:49] <TheFramedWarlock> BRRRRRRRRR
[1:07:49] <%thetrashman_sc> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:07:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> the grains

[1:07:51] <arduousScavenger> Hack into his computer to make it shoot him in the face!
[1:07:52] <%chiazam> NOT YET
[1:07:53] <%SvenHolgersson> COFFEE GO
[1:07:57] <TheNewJapanGuy> haha coffee machine goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:08:01] <%Frost_Quill> @LiquidDinosaur It's a fake mission. It's a recreation of real one their company did.
[1:08:03] <%chocoborb> the soothing sound xD
[1:08:05] <+Walopoh> Fake kill this man :)
[1:08:07] <+brightman42> sapienza is on that computer screen
[1:08:20] <%AzureGale> It's 47's initiation, it would make sense they would want to test him
[1:08:22] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:08:28] <captainnathaniel> those guys would make a KILLING as a acting group
[1:08:28] <%BoxNavy> kill :)
[1:08:28] <%AzureGale> Prop gun
[1:08:29] <+ArtsyFoxo> SNEAKY PA T

[1:19:47] <%sumrand0> YES I NEED to see Paige stream this game PLEADE
[1:19:48] <blastazoid00> No witnesses
[1:19:50] <%AzureGale> I prefer unconscious witnesses in a box or closet
[1:19:50] <dukenux> no witnesses
[1:19:50] <%sumrand0> PLEASE
[1:19:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> just kill em
[1:19:51] <%thetrashman_sc> hid them in boxes they'll never be found
[1:19:55] <+allups> they forget as soon as they get dumpstered
[1:19:55] <%SvenHolgersson> OFFICER THIS STREAM RIGHT HERE
[1:19:56] <Solidnick18> i just put them in lockers
[1:19:56] <@commanderclaw> Don't they not wake up if you stash them?
[1:19:58] <jorniev> good ol bloodthirsty pat
[1:19:59] <MultipleJiggs> Dead if they see your face, unconscious if they didn't.
[1:19:59] <T_Sasquatch> how about no witnesses
[1:20:02] <%MelBrooksKA> What about having no witnesses...
[1:20:03] <+Javaa01> You get docked way more points for indiscriminate murder
[1:20:03] <Brickston> oh but you're not gonna kill this guy?
[1:20:04] <%a_goth_pancake> seems psychotic.
[1:20:06] <%sniffy77> so is this just a training exercise or are you actually killing people
[1:20:10] <+PikeBot> If the unconscious witnesses are never found it's the same except the dead witness loses you mucho points
[1:20:12] <T_Sasquatch> its like you're a silent assassin or something
[1:20:17] <%MelBrooksKA> @commanderclaw ye
[1:20:19] <Coystick> Steal the jet's costume
[1:20:28] <Brickston> Pat is biased towards safety workers, snapped that guard's neck but left the flightman alive
[1:20:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> @commanderclaw They only wake up if someone else finds the body
[1:20:35] <JayEarly> @sniffy77 training exercise, or so they say
[1:20:36] <%Alazull> Dead is better if you leave them lying around. No chance of your cover being blown and if they are found won't get up and be another body to fight
[1:20:41] <%sumrand0> Assassinate the Airplane!
[1:20:46] <Butthole_Magilliacutty> you might want to put the bodies into a crate before putting on the disguise
[1:20:47] <Alazull> But unconcious is better if you can hide the body
[1:20:48] <arduousScavenger> Real jet, but cardboard helicopter?
[1:20:50] <Broken_Sonex> Justify every death by just saying "You shouldn't've looked." @PatStaresAt
[1:20:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Brickston Safety. DANCE.
[1:20:55] <%BoxNavy> you fixed the plane
[1:20:56] <%Dingalow> @Dingalow Nooo it was ego's pants that were shit... unless there seriously was a moment where arin shat the bed that I'm missing
[1:20:59] <+PikeBot> @sniffy77 it's a training exercise but the way Pat's going to kill the target is definitely 47 actually murdering an actor
[1:21:06] <Coystick> It's called Hitman not Hitjet fuck
[1:21:14] <+brightman42> this poor actor
[1:21:17] <%thetrashman_sc> chat i dont know if i want to watch hitman or play hitman NotLikeThis

[1:22:06] <%sumrand0> @linsp keeps the cost of training down!

[1:23:17] <GodGoshDarnIt> LOONEY FUCKING TUNES
[1:23:19] <%AzureGale> WAIT WHERE IS THE LINE WHERE DIANA SAYS YOU DIDN'T ACTIVATE THE PARACHUTE

[1:23:35] <%MoguManda> Paris is probably one of the hardest levels tbh
[1:23:41] <JayEarly> TRAINING EXERCISE

[1:23:44] <%Monkeyweed21> yea escalations

[1:24:54] <%Dingalow> What if you were like "oh boy, Hitman! I've been dying to play this game for years!", and then you turn it on and it's just a game where you hit a man>

[1:25:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Fireworks>
[1:25:13] <rafaelba93> do suit only you coward
[1:25:13] <gruntkorf> pat, escalation is a 5-tier mission on a single level.
[1:25:14] <+brightman42> this one is great
[1:25:16] <Butthole_Magilliacutty> push that bitch unto the other bitch
[1:25:20] <trickquestionz> Oh god remember the Christmas mission where you kill the two robbers from Home Alone!?
[1:25:23] <thelonechris> Hitman 2: 1
[1:25:23] <jack_s1n> ah
[1:25:27] <Brickston> Is it a coincidence that these targets look like epstien and maxwell
[1:25:28] <%sumrand0> Colorado 100% accurate depiction in this game. In the city youve got the pot smoking hipsters, but in the rural parts you've got the pot smoking militia men
[1:25:29] <%chiazam> THIS ONE
[1:25:35] <gruntkorf> oh I'm dumb my bad
[1:25:40] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:25:42] <%thetrashman_sc> oh boy
[1:25:45] <%AzureGale> Fun fact, Dalia's VA also voiced the Major in Ghost in the Shell
[1:25:50] <+Javaa01> @gruntkorf It's a cumulative challenge, 3 has one for doing like 17 total
[1:25:53] <%thetrashman_sc> SourPls
[1:25:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah shut up Yuri
[1:25:57] <+inferno_town> damn, I thought this was actual hitman 2 silent assassin
[1:26:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @sumrand0 I prefer colorado where its combined. the hippies smoke pot but also have guns
[1:26:00] <Vyneci> SourPls
[1:26:02] <%BoxNavy> how WILL we does it? 🤔
[1:26:03] <thelonechris> Good thing all of the goons you encounter are dumb as shit
[1:26:09] <%sumrand0> "Light" Novikov up
[1:26:13] <arduousScavenger> Take that, Stryker!
[1:26:14] <%AzureGale> Good thing they put closets in the bathrooms
[1:26:16] <Arek_1> SourPls
[1:26:17] <$Afterman_> pat just watched that man poop
[1:26:18] <%asgard147> BORK psaDogchamp
[1:26:19] <%Frost_Quill> Geif didn't like that.
[1:26:22] <%linSP> become a model pat, he’s hot
[1:26:30] <mike2hands> why's there a closet in the bathroom
[1:26:32] <+thecosmicfly> @AzureGale Paris be fancy like that
[1:26:33] <%chiazam> Didn't you talk about this one on the podcast?
[1:26:36] <%thetrashman_sc> rip
[1:26:36] <+vaderxyz1970> Its weird how no one questions 47 in the bathroom if its ocupied
[1:26:39] <%BoxNavy> securite
[1:26:39] <+CryptusMaximus> Sapienza has my favorite kill of the entire trilogy and it's HIDDEN
[1:26:41] <Brickston> @AzureGale You gotta have a spot to hang up your clothes while you poop
[1:26:41] <%Dingalow> Why are there wardrobes in the toilets?
[1:26:44] <T_Sasquatch> @AzureGale Why the fuck didnt i notice that LUL
[1:26:48] <mortificent> oh Dalia is voiced by the Major? pog
[1:26:50] <arduousScavenger> "Sorry, no bodyguards. Come back when you're wearing different clothes."
[1:27:07] <Zebroneath> I think the master key is in a middle hallway in the basement.
[1:27:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> This level looks good as shit in Hitman 3, those new reflections do some work
[1:27:15] <%sumrand0> @liquiddinosaur that's what Colorado is, just trends towards hipsters in town while hikers hang in the countryside parts
[1:27:20] <TheBeanBox> IMAGINE AN ACTUAL GUARD SAYING THAT TO SOMEONE LUL "Sorry bud, find another way in past me" LUL
[1:27:30] <PinkDaydreamer> h3 > h1
[1:27:30] <TheNewJapanGuy> You should stream Blood Money
[1:27:32] <+snausages_> The SSR is pretty nice yea
[1:27:32] <trickquestionz> Didn't a bonus mission have you kill Harry Busey for this?
[1:27:33] <Broken_Sonex> So here a dumb question: Why does no one ask about the barcode?
[1:27:33] <dukenux> Get the vampire disguise
[1:27:33] <%AzureGale> The Paris music is EXCELLENT
[1:27:33] <%DrunkenDice> what a shame
[1:27:36] <dan_g_v> bummer?
[1:27:37] <+blaze__drag> yeah what are you talking about Hitman 3 isn't even out yet!
[1:27:41] <shoobieredgrave> Why cant you play it in hitman 3? just got here
[1:27:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Piracy has never been a more viable option
[1:27:44] <%Alazull> For anyone who can play it in Hitman 3, did they add shortcuts you can unlock?
[1:27:45] <%Frost_Quill> Vampire Magician?
[1:27:48] <%SvenHolgersson> Yohohohohoho
[1:27:48] <+CryptusMaximus> On the flip side, mechanically all you miss out on is a camera. H3 is more of an expansion.
[1:27:48] <arduousScavenger> @TheBeanBox "You're not high enough level to unlock this area."
[1:27:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> securite
[1:27:50] <thelonechris> "If you want to progress forward, put on different clothes."
[1:27:50] <%Dingalow> Maybe I should get the weird ass Switch version of Hitman 3
[1:27:50] <%AzureGale> It's got that 90s TV show vibe to it
[1:27:52] <BioApple> @Broken_Sonex they don't want to be rude
[1:27:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah that's real unfortunate. At least the only thing you miss out on are shiny new gwaphics
[1:27:57] <%sniffy77> epic game store
[1:27:58] <dan_g_v> @Broken_Sonex it's a birth mark, it's rude to ask about it
[1:27:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @mortificent Her name is Motoko. This is a safe place, ScarJo isn't real she can't hurt you
[1:27:59] <%BoxNavy> yep
[1:28:00] <%MoguManda> ???
[1:28:00] <%MrGuy516> why not? you have a PS5.
[1:28:03] <shoobieredgrave> Ah i see
[1:28:04] <primaryfire> right
[1:28:05] <%sniffy77> im guessing
[1:28:05] <+brightman42> they did? unless you mean the hitman 2 levels on pc
[1:28:05] <%Dunmarkh> correct
[1:28:12] <%thetrashman_sc> they're still working on that
[1:28:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> the goddamn fuck
[1:28:14] <%sumrand0> @pinkdaydreamer What does H3 add besides a few maps? 1 gadget?
[1:28:15] <+b_aleph> Oh yes, the shit with the goddamn fuck, that is a big issue
[1:28:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> got it
[1:28:19] <%Dingalow> Ah yes, the God damn fuck, I've heard of that drama
[1:28:19] <JayEarly> my favorite thing is how people talk to you in disguise
[1:28:20] <%MoguManda> hitman 1 levels got moved over
[1:28:22] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> "The only way past me is to knock me out and put me in a dumpster, haha."
[1:28:24] <%BoxNavy> well just buy em again on ps5 4Head
[1:28:26] <%MoguManda> everyone got hitman 1 for free
[1:28:28] <+snausages_> Berlin mission is pretty sick
[1:28:30] <JayEarly> “You go, security!”
[1:28:36] <%Dingalow> I think the president was involved in that
[1:28:40] <+Walopoh> I mean its not like this version is old, still looks good and the fix is also coming for 3
[1:28:41] <Vyneci> Just re-do everything 4Head
[1:28:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @JayEarly remember in Phantom Pain where guards will have conversations with inflatable decoy guards
[1:28:45] <dan_g_v> very gently
[1:28:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm glad I waited and just got the full series on EGS so I didn't have to put up with the BS
[1:28:51] <CappuccinoGuil> So if you have 1 & 2 on Steam, but 3 on EGS, you can't do the levels from 1 & 2 on 3?
[1:29:01] <+Javaa01> @snausages_ Berlin is structurally probably the most interesting mission in the new trilogy
[1:29:03] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex Is that real?
[1:29:06] <%MoguManda> You can't do 2 because ???
[1:29:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> @CappuccinoGuil Correct
[1:29:11] <%MoguManda> But you can do 1 in 3
[1:29:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil yeah basically do not buy this game until its out n Steam
[1:29:20] <%thetrashman_sc> @CappuccinoGuil not at the moment they're working on a fix
[1:29:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CappuccinoGuil or rather, dont buy hItman 3
[1:29:25] <marrowjuice> THAT
[1:29:26] <%AzureGale> THAT is Dalia
[1:29:26] <%thetrashman_sc> THAT
[1:29:27] <+thecosmicfly> There also aren't as many gameplay/level changes from H2 to H3 as with H1 to H2
[1:29:29] <+CryptusMaximus> Be glad you didn't earn every unlock on Hitman 2016, only to have to do it all again on Hitman 2 because Square Enix owned those servers
[1:29:30] <shoobieredgrave> i remember reading they were planning to fix that asap like 2 weeks ago
[1:29:31] <+Javaa01> @MoguManda They haven't figured out the PC transfer for 2 yet
[1:29:34] <%whyskeywolfe> Ah Paris, the Montreal of France.
[1:29:35] <+thecosmicfly> Like the crowd stealth or bushes
[1:29:36] <+brightman42> love the idiots looking at them while still inside
[1:29:44] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh wow, that's a massive oversight, IO, geez
[1:29:51] <ape_hawk> who the fuck fires off fireworks before nighttime?
[1:29:58] <+Walopoh> I watched Vinny stream the Goldeneye Remaster last night and was just thinking about incredible IO's Bond game will be
[1:30:00] <arduousScavenger> "I'm gonna record this fireworks show and then never watch it."
[1:30:03] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[1:30:04] <+snausages_> oh shit

[1:30:21] <%Gogogolem> wait why did they die?
[1:30:22] <%TheWinged7> how does no one inside notice that

[1:30:30] <+PikeBot> That was a twofer indeed. There's a challenge for doing it!
[1:30:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> D-D-D-D-D-DOUBLE KILL
[1:30:33] <@commanderclaw> Learning a Hitman level is so fucking satisyfing
[1:30:33] <%SaiyanShoto> Did she fall on top of the guy? LUL LUL
[1:30:33] <+thecosmicfly> What a tragic accident
[1:30:35] <+DeRedBaron> OMG LIKE OMG
[1:30:35] <+IveGotALaserFace> Opps, an accident.
[1:30:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> Her story is SHE'S FUKKIN DEAD
[1:30:38] <Butthole_Magilliacutty> FROM THE TOP ROPE
[1:30:38] <%chiazam> Fuckin sick
[1:30:39] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Nonsense twofer
[1:30:41] <Dodolo212> Silent Accident
[1:30:41] <trickquestionz> That's a fucking assassin move!
[1:30:41] <JayEarly> HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED
[1:30:42] <%sniffy77> dont know her story, know the ending though
[1:30:43] <+Javaa01> @Gogogolem A person fell on them from 3 stories high, that tends to kill people
[1:30:43] <%AzureGale> SILENT ASSASSIN VOIDED
[1:30:45] <+DeRedBaron> I DIDN"T THINK YOU COULD DO THAT
[1:30:46] <%DrunkenDice> happy little accident CoolStoryBob
[1:30:50] <Brickston> She pulled a Mankind
[1:30:50] <%linSP> two for one special
[1:30:51] <marrowjuice> YOU CAN MAKE HER FALL ON THE OTHER TARGET????
[1:30:51] <Wan6Saber> Pat killed two fools with one push jennLOL kiaaLOL
[1:30:51] <trickquestionz> HK-47 is weeping at that!
[1:30:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ah, an accident. Something beyond your control
[1:30:57] <%baka_sugoi> MAN HIT psaDab
[1:30:57] <+Walopoh> "Who is this SAME bald guy that keeps appearing on security footage killing people?"
[1:30:58] <rafaelba93> way to fuck up the score in the end
[1:31:11] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[1:31:14] <+brightman42> close to perfect tho
[1:31:14] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Nice hit, man!
[1:31:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> greatest assassin in world 47
[1:31:19] <%Dingalow> for the lulz
[1:31:25] <%sumrand0> @thecosmicfly yeah H3 appears to act more like DLC vs. a new game. mechanically it adds almost 0 new items to change your approach or strategy your primary rewards are just the level unlocks which feels like hollow progression since it doesn't help in tbe next map
[1:31:25] <dan_g_v> streamerman
[1:31:28] <arduousScavenger> @Walopoh "What are you talking about, that bald guy is wearing different clothes than that bald guy."
[1:31:30] <%asgard147> What a horible accident limesEvil
[1:31:30] <+CryptusMaximus> I "slowrun" Hitman. Basically I complete them without running and must maintain a cool demeanor at all times.
[1:31:31] <%twilight_cleric> I can't believe that lady tripped and died
[1:31:32] <CookieCutter007> !uptime
[1:31:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 31m.
[1:31:33] <%linSP> escaping thru the sewers huh
[1:31:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Walopoh there's a mechanic in HItman Blood Money where if you get caught on camera and dont delete it before you leave they'll start to sketch a picture of you in the newspaper
[1:31:36] <%PaladinDupre> CLOWN
[1:31:36] <Sunstalker> Imagine how fucked you must feel if you're part of the evil cabal and you find out two members died like this monkaS
[1:31:37] <Cendov> The level ending music is so satisfying
[1:31:42] <%twilight_cleric> dats what happuns
[1:31:44] <Dingalow> @Cici_TheMoonRabbit "Hey... I'm a Hitman, too"
[1:31:48] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat is the hitman
[1:31:53] <thelonechris> You accidentally lifted her up over the rail and pushed her
[1:31:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> 4 stars
[1:31:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> cmon pat
[1:31:58] <%MisterRockett> @CryptusMaximus Best way to play the game tbh.
[1:32:01] <@commanderclaw> Sapienza is rad
[1:32:08] <%thetrashman_sc> this level is very good
[1:32:09] <%Blank9> remember pat, if you get caught just tell them aaaaa you poopa your pants
[1:32:11] <+Kataiser> Sapienza is probably one of the two best maps in Hitman 1. It's really good.
[1:32:14] <%SaiyanShoto> Give Agent 47 a ginger beard and he's basically Pat Kappa
[1:32:17] <Meekest> Dont look in the meat freezer in Sapienza
[1:32:18] <%AzureGale> This is a good level
[1:32:19] <%sumrand0> Ahhh the good ol' Cliff Push place
[1:32:19] <dan_g_v> wait, is Pat fighting a Bayonetta boss?
[1:32:21] <Cendov> I love this level
[1:32:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> The last part of this misison was hard af for me
[1:32:23] <rafaelba93> have you played it at all?
[1:32:24] <%saadi90> Sapienza is awesome!
[1:32:25] <+hdawger> Sapient is the best
[1:32:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh wow that guy is a douche
[1:32:31] <%MoguManda> extremely good level
[1:32:32] <mortificent> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Pls keep talking Diane Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:32:33] <%chiazam> Sapienza makes me want to fucking travel
[1:32:37] <thelonechris> Topical

[1:32:43] <%linSP> it’s crazy how good these environments are
[1:32:44] <Sunstalker> This universe works under Aunty Donna rules kinamaHappyW
[1:32:45] <dukenux> Sapienza might be one of the best levels in the whole series
[1:32:46] <%Monkeyweed21> this dude inventing FOXDIE
[1:32:46] <+snausages_> Sapienza is the best level, very winding and dense
[1:32:46] <Broken_Sonex> FOX DIE?!
[1:32:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Sapienza is probs one of the top 5-8 maps from the new games
[1:32:48] <Vex_Machina> FOX
[1:32:50] <Vyneci> Oh boy Resident Evil!
[1:32:51] <primarch_lupercal> FOXDIE
[1:32:51] <Dodolo212> Foxdie
[1:32:52] <%Dingalow> Dunno if I'm alone here but I can't not think of Oneyplays whenever I play this game lmao

[1:32:54] <%MrGuy516> you quit after mission 1?
[1:32:55] <trickquestionz> Oh this hits ways different

[1:32:59] <%UW_Duncan> you gonna put the whole town in a freezer like that one streamer? @patstaresat
[1:33:02] <arduousScavenger> Wow, they didn't have to try NEARLY this hard to spread a virus.

[1:33:14] <ape_hawk> pat, can you get me a dr. pepper? thanks
[1:33:15] <TrollKing96> Is it just me or does IO have a thing for big levels?
[1:33:16] <Wan6Saber> better than teleport weapons!!! mafiajInxevil mafiajInxevil
[1:33:17] <%AzureGale> Pat does Paris
[1:33:18] <dukenux> Do not feed the rats D:

[1:33:21] <Butthole_Magilliacutty> BROTHER!
[1:33:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> ITS NOT THE MORALS ITS THE COMPETITION
[1:33:24] <+brightman42> well at least you like it
[1:33:24] <%baka_sugoi> murder plz
[1:33:25] <%AzureGale> Pat did a lot of Paris
[1:33:25] <marrowjuice> I want a Hitman game where you get a Stand
[1:33:26] <+Javaa01> @thelonechris They also called the current stock market troubles in Hitman 2's DLC
[1:33:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> LOVE IT
[1:33:26] <CassyASG> omg pat hardcore 100%
[1:33:27] <%linSP> kill those killers they’re bad!
[1:33:27] <ConorIsOnTwitchNow> You're that Hitman...
[1:33:29] <Laecerelius> So much murder gurl
[1:33:33] <+AugustRei> there's so much to discover in this level
[1:33:37] <%chiazam> KILLLLLLLLLLLL
[1:33:47] <+AugustRei> i finished a run and then looked at a challenge that referenced two things i had NO context for at all
[1:33:48] <%MoguManda> hitman bought all the gamestop stock
[1:33:49] <%AzureGale> Yep
[1:33:52] <%BoxNavy> :) of course
[1:33:54] <soflicar> and true form suit only
[1:33:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> PROTECT OUR TRADE
[1:33:56] <%DrunkenDice> yeah my games never go like that
[1:33:56] <+Gigagoat> kill them all pat
[1:33:59] <+thecosmicfly> It's funny how the story cutscenes got worse, but these briefing animations got waaay better visually
[1:34:00] <%baka_sugoi> kill with golfball
[1:34:00] <TheBeanBox> Ahhh the true Hitm'n
[1:34:00] <Vex_Machina> Kill em all Pat.
[1:34:01] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Is she has a brother that the governor of Flordia
[1:34:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea Silent Assassin Ranking is the "canon" way
[1:34:04] <%Ghufufin> plus or minus some wanton murder?
[1:34:04] <gruntkorf> SASO for the true men
[1:34:04] <%Alazull> Also, no bodies found and do it in your suit
[1:34:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> WE NEED OUR MONOPOLY
[1:34:06] <Broken_Sonex> @marrowjuice His stand is to disguise as anyone
[1:34:07] <%Monkeyweed21> get a lockpick
[1:34:07] <arduousScavenger> @MoguManda "Oh wow, what an accident."
[1:34:09] <T_Sasquatch> BITCH BABY BOOO
[1:34:09] <dukenux> @TrollKing96 they basicly went that way in Hitman 1(the new one). Instead of dozen of smaller missions its couple of HUGE levels
[1:34:11] <%baka_sugoi> fair
[1:34:12] <%BoxNavy> youre on casual difficulty
[1:34:14] <+CryptusMaximus> I hate mission stories, but they're probably better for streams tbh
[1:34:14] <+Markmeltzer> Mission Stories are fine
[1:34:14] <%chiazam> Are we killing them because they're evil, OR because they're bad for business?
[1:34:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> FOXDIE
[1:34:18] <marrowjuice> But that doesn't fulfill my murder boner, Pat
[1:34:20] <%Dingalow> bruh I don't care it's a damn game lol
[1:34:22] <%M4T1A5> They are a good way to discover the main parts of the level
[1:34:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> WAWAWA
[1:34:25] <%sniffy77> pat overwatch 2 wont release until 2022
[1:34:29] <+brightman42> SASO in this level is a bit tricky
[1:34:34] <%whyskeywolfe> This town is achingly beautiful.
[1:34:34] <%linSP> the mission stories are cool tho
[1:34:34] <gruntkorf> mission stories are funny most of the time
[1:34:36] <ape_hawk> i want a good Hitman live-action murder-procedural show
[1:34:41] <+aram909> that is the correct choice, the mission stories are amazing
[1:34:42] <JayEarly> @chiazam little bit of a little bit of b
[1:34:42] <%Dingalow> What's an Overwatch 2?
[1:34:45] <%W1nterTitan> I'm shocked. shocked
[1:34:47] <%BoxNavy> yep
[1:34:47] <+aram909> anyone that hates the mission stories can fuck off
[1:34:48] <gruntkorf> omg SASO on this and marrakesh is a nightmare
[1:34:48] <SlangPunk> @chiazam Nah, we kill them for the money
[1:34:51] <+blaze__drag> 100% true
[1:34:51] <%baka_sugoi> overwatch 2 is a meme
[1:34:52] <@commanderclaw> I assume a lot of the Devs found out when we did
[1:34:53] <+DeRedBaron> i agree with pat, even on normal or casual this game is a bit more stressful with the mission stories
[1:34:55] <DeoxysPrime> Its existence was leaked well before that
[1:34:56] <Broken_Sonex> Overwatch 2 IS NOT REAL.
[1:34:59] <%TheBensonator_> Overwatch, the game that literally doesn't need a sequel, getting a sequel
[1:34:59] <%DrunkenDice> I completely forgot about OW2
[1:35:01] <%MoguManda> and my overwatch too
[1:35:03] <dukenux> i forgot Hearthstone existed
[1:35:03] <spacecatstreams> i miss having fun in that game
[1:35:03] <agrodiesius> not one less!
[1:35:03] <%TheBensonator_> Never fails to make me LUL
[1:35:06] <rafaelba93> its balanced around the stories, to do all the challenges they hardly matter
[1:35:08] <+Walopoh> Overwatch 2 was the animated trailer, nothing more
[1:35:09] <+AugustRei> oh god this one is so good
[1:35:09] <%Alazull> Yeyeyeye
[1:35:09] <+Keaton_x> I honestly forgot Overwatch 2 was even a thing.
[1:35:13] <+Javaa01> Time to go bully Rocco again
[1:35:14] <Slim_Lipid> @Dingalow An expansion pack for the hit game "Overwatch"
[1:35:15] <%ssjklyco> Blizzard is out of apology announcemtns, so hope they don't do another fucky wucky
[1:35:15] <thelonechris> What's an Overwatch?
[1:35:17] <majindusto> WHAT'S AN OVERWATCH 2?
[1:35:19] <ExpressNode> It doesn't exist unless I see it :)
[1:35:21] <+blaze__drag> the way you get inside is by dragging every single character on the map into the meat locker
[1:35:21] <%AzureGale> My favorite part about the mission stories is that they always end a few steps before the kill opportunity arises, as if to say "good job getting this far, we're confident you can go the rest of the way yourself"
[1:35:23] <%Dingalow> Overwatch 2 sounds like a thing a corporation would make to take some heat off themselves or something
[1:35:29] <+thecosmicfly> Leave Rocco Botte alone
[1:35:37] <%sumrand0> 1st completions of most maps for me was a bloodbath but the messy success usually rewards a useful unlock that makes actual no witness accident based assassinations easy/possible
[1:35:40] <%linSP> over watch 2 you mean the porn expansion?
[1:35:40] <%TheBensonator_> How can they make an Overwatch 2 when there isn't even an Underwatch?
[1:35:41] <%chiazam> Poor kid
[1:35:42] <ape_hawk> sapienza is such a great map
[1:35:47] <arduousScavenger> Everyone saying "I forgot about Overwatch 2" proves that went exactly the opposite way of what Blizzard hoped.
[1:35:50] <%Dingalow> @Dingalow Is it ACTUALLY gonna be an expansion pack and not a new game???
[1:35:53] <%kyh9> This game is surprisingly detailed in its environments
[1:35:54] <TrollKing96> I
[1:36:02] <thelonechris> Wait WTF
[1:36:03] <dukenux> the verticaliyu
[1:36:04] <%kyh9> WAIT
[1:36:06] <+aram909> @AzureGale yeah theyre never too handholdy and they know just when to let you do your thing
[1:36:06] <%kyh9> WHAT IS HE PLAYING
[1:36:07] <rafaelba93> i like to do the stories after i finish the misson once by myself
[1:36:07] <dukenux> *verticality
[1:36:10] <+aram909> its a very very very good balance
[1:36:11] <%TheBensonator_> STEAL THE RAZER HEADSET AND KILL A MAN WITH IT
[1:36:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> this was the map where you could kill literal Gary Busey.
[1:36:15] <+Walopoh> Do you think OW2 will reach anywhere near the peak of popularity as the first game? @PatStaresAt
[1:36:17] <dan_g_v> the card of keys
[1:36:20] <%kyh9> GO PLAY THE GAMES
[1:36:21] <+brightman42> well now he's definitely gonna be late for work
[1:36:22] <Broken_Sonex> @kyh9 He's hitting men
[1:36:23] <%AnthroMetal> PAT REMEMBER TO BREATHE
[1:36:25] <shoobieredgrave> Guys relax he was just playing omikron
[1:36:26] <%kyh9> GO PLAY HITMAN ABSOLUTION ON HIS COMPUTER
[1:36:26] <%baka_sugoi> @kyh9 the hitman
[1:36:31] <%linSP> remember to save scum
[1:36:33] <TrollKing96> I'd kill for a new Freedom Fighters.
[1:36:34] <%Dingalow> @thecosmicfly Rocco Botte's a bro, he made my favourite series on Youtube "The History of Voltage Vengerz"
[1:36:35] <+CptBritches> Now heat the key
[1:36:45] <%UW_Duncan> Step 2: Profit
[1:36:48] <Meekest> You can get an exploding golf ball in this level
[1:36:48] <%chiazam> PAT
[1:36:56] <%Puhff> woolieFUN
[1:36:59] <+aram909> mission stories are like the best thing this series has done to really elevate the series from great to fantastic
[1:37:01] <arduousScavenger> @TheBensonator_ "That's cool, Benson, but stop making this all about you and these SWEET Razer products."
[1:37:04] <TheBeanBox> "Step 1 Complete... I'm lost"
[1:37:04] <+brightman42> explosion
[1:37:04] <rafaelba93> you can do anything if you save scum enough
[1:37:07] <%AzureGale> Custom contracts
[1:37:08] <PinkDaydreamer> distraction
[1:37:09] <%kyh9> distraction
[1:37:09] <$Afterman_> for other targets probably
[1:37:12] <+blaze__drag> I think it's just universal stuff
[1:37:12] <+vampireinarm> wow youre dumb
[1:37:12] <%MoguManda> a lot of those are for contracts
[1:37:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> it probably makes the owner of the bike come out
[1:37:15] <marrowjuice> it's for the side missions
[1:37:15] <dukenux> someone slips and it's funni
[1:37:16] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Blow up the van?
[1:37:16] <%BoxNavy> have somone slip on it and laugh at them
[1:37:17] <+YabbaTroll> There are a lot of alternate missions in this game
[1:37:17] <+Walopoh> It's about sending a message LUL
[1:37:19] <@commanderclaw> Side missions
[1:37:20] <Vex_Machina> For fun.
[1:37:21] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt You can detonate the bike to cause the guards to panic and leave their post at the front gate
[1:37:22] <%mield916> Contracts
[1:37:25] <rafaelba93> its just part of the sandbox, or for online contracts
[1:37:26] <+CryptusMaximus> That stuff is for the 'contracts" mode where you could potentially use it on other NPCs.
[1:37:28] <+aram909> like, ignore hitman absolution, all the previous hitman games up to blood money were pretty good, with blood money being a high point, but these latest 3 games are just in another league
[1:37:37] <%AzureGale> Time 2 poop
[1:37:38] <primaryfire> it could be used in a custom challenge like an escalation
[1:37:38] <%sumrand0> "WELL HERE I GO KILLING AGAIN"
[1:37:39] <%Frost_Quill> "Time to poop." - 47
[1:37:41] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Some of that stuff is only useful for like the Elusive Targets/player made challenges
[1:37:45] <+Walopoh> INFINITE POSSIBILITIES
[1:37:46] <%DrunkenDice> kill him anyway :)
[1:37:50] <xxMylord> Is the heavy breathing normal or is his microphone setup wrong?
[1:37:55] <Meekest> "Kate, that bald new employee stared at me, looking at my clothes"
[1:37:57] <Broken_Sonex> OMG.....47's stand would be called "Man Who Sold the World" @PatStaresAt
[1:38:06] <arduousScavenger> "I AM GOING ON BREAK."
[1:38:08] <%linSP> I am thou, thou art i
[1:38:13] <%whyskeywolfe> This game is gorgeous.
[1:38:13] <+wampa661> I like the food poison route on this one
[1:38:26] <SaltyAzteca> Hows the music been in Hitman?
[1:38:29] <arduousScavenger> @Meekest "GOSH, Steve, just take the damn compliment."
[1:38:33] <+thecosmicfly> Yall ever stand behind someone irl and think "I could just choke this motherfucker out right now, and he doesn't know it"
[1:38:40] <ConorIsOnTwitchNow> "im hitman and you are too"
[1:38:48] <+Walopoh> NOT RIGHT
[1:38:48] <%AzureGale> Time 2 knock out a bodyguard
[1:38:49] <thelonechris> Can you launch people off that chairlift like in Gremlins?
[1:38:52] <dukenux> music's pretty good, but the older games had Jesper Kyd
[1:38:57] <Slim_Lipid> HotPokket
[1:38:59] <dan_g_v> only cowards doesn't take a ladies clothes
[1:39:00] <+Javaa01> @SaltyAzteca The soundtrack of the new games is pretty good, doesn't necessarily hit the highs of the old games, but it's still good
[1:39:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> When will Hitman have to dress in drag for a mission
[1:39:02] <%BoxNavy> jermaRat ?
[1:39:04] <dukenux> RATS
[1:39:05] <SaltyAzteca> @dukenux Thats why im asking
[1:39:05] <Sunstalker> Shut up Yuri
[1:39:06] <%AzureGale> Thanks Yosuke
[1:39:08] <%SvenHolgersson> LET 47 CROSSDRESS YOU COWARDS
[1:39:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> YOU CAN MURDER
[1:39:10] <dan_g_v> are you a hitman enough to be a sexy maid?
[1:39:11] <Jolly_Adventurer> @thecosmicfly No because 90% of people could easily kick my scrawny ass
[1:39:14] <%Dingalow> Nooo the game forces the player to harm the lady because it's sexist!!!!!
[1:39:15] <%ssjklyco> Yuri?
[1:39:18] <%chiazam> YURI LOWENTHAAL!?
[1:39:18] <@commanderclaw> @LiquidDinosaur When he takes a mission to Kamurocho
[1:39:18] <SaltyAzteca> @Javaa01 awwwwwww well at least its good enough
[1:39:22] <+TheNewZealandStory> was that sean chiplock
[1:39:28] <CassyASG> yuri is everyother guard
[1:39:30] <%chiazam> Why is Yuri fuggin everywhere

[1:39:36] <%Dunmarkh> need femboy assassin
[1:39:40] <%AzureGale> Give us an androgynous Agent 48
[1:39:42] <shoobieredgrave> I still cant believe he played spiderman
[1:39:42] <%ssjklyco> This sounds like Luca Yury
[1:39:42] <%Ranryu692> oh, sup Yuri
[1:39:46] <dukenux> silverwaaar
[1:39:47] <rafaelba93> suit only is fun as hell
[1:39:50] <+brightman42> he deserves whatever you do to him
[1:39:52] <%sumrand0> Hitman accurately teaches you that if you look like kitchen staff/stage crew you can essentially walk around anywhere without question. hurray for the upturned nose of the upperclass! they never see it coming hahaha
[1:39:53] <JayEarly> The Yuri everywhere system
[1:39:54] <BioApple> when someone asks me why i staff my huge mansion with only lady maids i tell them it's for hitman-proofing
[1:39:55] <%chiazam> The Yuri Everywhere System
[1:39:56] <%Deft_Thought> Who the fuck says Curriculum Vitae?
[1:39:59] <%Deft_Thought> KILL HIM

[1:40:07] <+Javaa01> @chiazam The maps for the first game had a laughably low voice acting budget

[1:40:23] <dan_g_v> save scum
[1:40:24] <+AugustRei> don't worry deleting the footage is pretty easy on this map
[1:40:24] <%TheBensonator_> psaBig sbaabsRIP
[1:40:25] <+Kataiser> Now the tapes must go
[1:40:27] <TheBeanBox> That's what you get for interacting with chat
[1:40:27] <+TheMorilo> There's my answer
[1:40:27] <%AzureGale> At least disabling the security system in this level is easy
[1:40:29] <dan_g_v> tweak the save files
[1:40:29] <%Deft_Thought> Folks don't just say CV?
[1:40:31] <%Ipsenscastle> just find the video place and fuck it up, it's fine
[1:40:31] <+argavus> F
[1:40:31] <%thedankestmeeme> CLIP IT

[1:40:48] <%MoguManda> up!
[1:40:49] <+AugustRei> you'll find it later guranteed
[1:40:49] <%Frost_Quill> Sapienza and Paris are the only missions I've bothered to Silent Assassin Suit Only.
[1:40:50] <shoobieredgrave> Upstairs
[1:40:50] <HeroToxiko> crazy talk starts playing
[1:40:54] <%Movemeister> imagine not speaking latin
[1:40:54] <%MoguManda> 3rd floor
[1:41:02] <+CryptusMaximus> You can unlock and EMP charge in the H2 levels that's super useful for security systems
[1:41:09] <+AugustRei> you can also delete the footage downstairs
[1:41:11] <%AzureGale> Thanks, Prince of Persia
[1:41:14] <%brickwall35> you schmuck
[1:41:14] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt Why not actually sneak around?
[1:41:15] <marrowjuice> There's something about Hitman that makes me want to go big murder even though that's obviously a terrible idea for completing the mission
[1:41:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ooh lala the Gourmet
[1:41:23] <jotabranded> wait this is the level from the first one?
[1:41:24] <CassyASG> good doggie
[1:41:25] <Profmcstevie> I feel comforted by the guiding snore of Gief
[1:41:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dunmarkh you gotta infiltrate a programmer's office so you need rainbow stockings
[1:41:27] <Vex_Machina> Push...
[1:41:28] <dukenux> oh god, hes loud
[1:41:32] <+thecosmicfly> Can also disable the security at the church, for w/e reason they made it so ANY security terminal wipes evidence in a level
[1:41:33] <%AzureGale> Good job Pat
[1:41:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> hmmm
[1:41:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dress as a taco. Everyone likes tacos
[1:41:40] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt There's multiple different places where you can destroy the footage on this map, you'll most likely find one just trying to get to your objectives
[1:41:46] <shoobieredgrave> That guy dressed like his name was inny
[1:41:49] <Broken_Sonex> We passed upon the stair....
[1:41:49] <shoobieredgrave> vinny*
[1:41:52] <Profmcstevie> To the ocean with you!
[1:41:53] <%sumrand0> sorry NOT 2ND I forgot which level you're on. I believe security cam main tapes ARE nearby.
[1:41:54] <BioApple> @thecosmicfly they use ctOS
[1:41:54] <+CryptusMaximus> SILENT ASSASSIN RUINED
[1:41:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> that's his cooking gun
[1:41:56] <%chiazam> Dump the body
[1:41:58] <+blaze__drag> *Accident*
[1:41:58] <rafaelba93> oh
[1:41:59] <$Afterman_> while naked
[1:42:07] <+blaze__drag> I hate it when I accidentally take off all my clothes and fall over a ledge
[1:42:08] <+thecosmicfly> @BioApple lol
[1:42:10] <rafaelba93> no SA then
[1:42:10] <arduousScavenger> "He clearly accidentally stripped off his clothes and slipped off the balcony."
[1:42:11] <%alcors_wisdom> gotta stay strapped incase the lobster starts fighting back
[1:42:14] <+PikeBot> 'Kitchen assistant' was your old disguise ont he ground Pat lol
[1:42:21] <+argavus> Baby snoring
[1:42:24] <%AzureGale> Was probably on drugs
[1:42:31] <%Ranryu692> my dad did that once
[1:42:35] <%maybefalco> its the evolution of choke jerking
[1:42:37] <Profmcstevie> He was gonna do the biggest skinny dip leap but failed
[1:42:38] <dukenux> It was really hot outside
[1:42:48] <%Dingalow> That is a loud fucking snore
[1:42:58] <+argavus> For real Gief sounds like a monster sleeping
[1:43:02] <%GarbageNirvana> What is it about wife beaters that makes them the de facto thug uniform
[1:43:07] <%AzureGale> This gon' be good
[1:43:17] <dukenux> M-muther?

[1:43:23] <%kyh9> Ghooooosts
[1:43:23] <JayEarly> @garbagenirvana its in the name
[1:43:26] <Laecerelius> Spoooookie time!
[1:43:30] <arduousScavenger> @GarbageNirvana You need to put on a black tank top to disguise yourself as Neil Breen.
[1:43:31] <TheNewJapanGuy> You can fiberwire a ghost in Hitman Contracts
[1:43:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GarbageNirvana IIRC in basically every language there's a nickname for a sleeveless t-shirt that implies people who wear them are dirtbags
[1:43:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Moooooother
[1:43:36] <+AugustRei> this one is some home alone shit
[1:43:36] <marrowjuice> @GarbageNirvana I mean, the name alone helps
[1:43:38] <%kyh9> GhOoOoOsts
[1:43:42] <%chiazam> Time to fuck with this guy
[1:43:45] <+Taglog7> banana phone?
[1:43:46] <%Frost_Quill> Ghosts canonically exist in the Hitman universe right?
[1:43:47] <suddenlyscorched> @ReallyBigRocks confirmed
[1:43:48] <TheBeanBox> Phone his grandma, do it
[1:43:48] <dukenux> this reminds me about a ghost easter egg in Contracts
[1:43:48] <%sumrand0> Hitmam needs to add the "blend in" mechanic from AC but in this version 47 pulls out his cell & plays Pokémon Go!
[1:43:53] <Vex_Machina> Summon a ghost to kill him.
[1:43:55] <+argavus> Time to create spooks
[1:43:56] <suddenlyscorched> A sniper rifle helps
[1:44:08] <Tuna_Can_0> BOP em with a wrench :)
[1:44:11] <+argavus> Is pat other stinky?
[1:44:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @sumrand0 is the mission specifically set in Summer of 2016?
[1:44:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> When do we get to dress up as Yolanda the Prostitute
[1:44:21] <+jjolion> In the UK it 10:42pm
[1:44:22] <+someyounguy1> all moments follow the previous until your last moment.
[1:44:23] <%kyh9> LETS TRAUMATIZE HIM MORE
[1:44:26] <arduousScavenger> @sumrand0 It would explain why he stumbles upon so many dead bodies.
[1:44:28] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat is big stinky
[1:44:33] <soflicar> this one is the best
[1:44:38] <%MoguManda> trauma him to death
[1:44:44] <%Dingalow> We're all just little creatures trying to fill 12 hours a day until the next day
[1:44:53] <majindusto> Jesus Christ , Paige
[1:45:00] <dukenux> that's a Contracts reference
[1:45:02] <JayEarly> @kyh9 he is making foxdie, he deserves it
[1:45:07] <+thecosmicfly> 100% pointless hot take: I prefered when Mission Stories were called Opportunities
[1:45:09] <majindusto> lol
[1:45:11] <arduousScavenger> "Pirating DVD's YOU DESERVE DEATH!"
[1:45:16] <%sumrand0> @liquiddinosaur of course didn't you know the Hitman franchise is one giant guerilla marketing tool for Niantic

[2:04:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHY
[2:05:00] <%bhp_99> what you discovered was that you didn't save
[2:05:03] <ammobasket> Sigma Males can draw the Cool S
[2:05:06] <+thecosmicfly> What about Charlie or Delta males?
[2:05:07] <%Bt_Robot> Is a sigma male a member of G.I. Joe's Sigma Six?
[2:05:10] <JayEarly> Gief snorin
[2:05:11] <majindusto> FUCKING DUH!!!
[2:05:18] <+Troispoint> The big S on Superman is for Sigma
[2:05:20] <+brightman42> poison his water or use coins
[2:05:24] <%sumrand0> HINT if they're 10 feet away, they can probably see you
[2:05:29] <%toolofparanoia> 47... Doing it his own way
[2:05:29] <%baka_sugoi> why not take out the surveillance system?
[2:05:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> Cool, time to listen to the thing again because Pat didn't save
[2:05:39] <+wampa661> Unfortunately its not just vison cones but sound as well
[2:05:39] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Troispoint actually it's for sugondese
[2:05:45] <%baka_sugoi> pee po
[2:05:48] <+dante_must_die_exe> dah peepo

[2:05:51] <aura_00> only one thing can stop sigma males, OMEGA MALES
[2:05:51] <%Alazull> Toss a coin to distract the guard
[2:05:54] <justindgbz> Zach Snyder's Sigma Male
[2:05:55] <Laecerelius> But da peepo!
[2:05:55] <+CryptusMaximus> @LiquidDinosaur Only if you get one

[2:06:34] <%baka_sugoi> very heard green line
[2:06:35] <arduousScavenger> "Hey, check out my new camera! Oh wait, this isn't a camera."
[2:06:36] <+AugustRei> you can get some rat poison from the kitchen and put it in his drink
[2:06:37] <+CryptusMaximus> That tall grass patch he's next to can hide bodies as well
[2:06:39] <%toolofparanoia> Pat hates money
[2:06:47] <%sumrand0> fuck it! Don't thank me for my Twitch prime sub, it's literally just free money so just do the big murderz
[2:06:55] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> toss a coin to your inconveniently placed guard
[2:07:05] <%sumrand0> Michael Jordan's a terrible golfer
[2:07:08] <%BoxNavy> fake sport
[2:07:16] <+Troispoint> big sippies
[2:07:18] <dukenux> gotta hydrate
[2:07:21] <waywardhavoc> if you put poison in that he will walk away

[2:07:34] <+thecosmicfly> Would be OP
[2:07:35] <%baka_sugoi> only some special disguises
[2:07:37] <%sumrand0> you need to be a tier 3 sub to talk to him
[2:07:38] <+Troispoint> Golf is the bourgeoisie sport
[2:07:39] <%toolofparanoia> Press X to Dude.
[2:07:43] <%BoxNavy> no poison jermaPluto
[2:07:44] <justindgbz> Ever see Kim Jong Un play golf?
[2:07:44] <primarch_lupercal> that will prob be in their 007 game
[2:07:46] <+AugustRei> poison in the kitchen
[2:07:46] <arduousScavenger> Strangle him, then jam his body into the 14th hole so it looks like the Looney Toons did it.
[2:07:46] <skyentombment> POISON
[2:07:49] <+Javaa01> You must acquire more rat poison
[2:07:50] <+wampa661> gotta get the shit yourself poison
[2:07:51] <+brightman42> there's rat poison in the kitchen somewhere
[2:07:56] <waywardhavoc> you can find poison in sheds and kitchens
[2:08:02] <+YabbaTroll> He's waiting for mr Caruso
[2:08:06] <skyentombment> He's just faffing about
[2:08:07] <%sumrand0> just throw something in a bush so he investigates the noise
[2:08:14] <%AzureGale> Loop figured out
[2:08:15] <%BoxNavy> isnt agent 47 like a clone or some shit they shoulda gave him a venom gland
[2:08:30] <%Monkeyweed21> you can poison for free with a cook disguise @PatStaresAt
[2:08:31] <+Javaa01> There's rat poison near the kitchen, as always
[2:08:32] <+YabbaTroll> Check the place where you threw the dude over the railing
[2:08:33] <%Frost_Quill> Gardeners carry poison, right?
[2:08:36] <dukenux> beat him to death with a golf club
[2:08:37] <+ArtsyFoxo> A venom gland sounds super sick
[2:08:41] <justindgbz> Venom is stored in the balls
[2:08:49] <Saltmeisterr> pesticide?
[2:08:51] <Dingalow> Look at this Game of Thrones ass garden
[2:08:51] <+thecosmicfly> Venom 47
[2:08:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Just shit in his water
[2:08:51] <%Alazull> Check the kitchen
[2:08:52] <arduousScavenger> @BoxNavy I think they should've given him the power to resurrect zombies to obey him once per day.
[2:08:53] <DeoxysPrime> Just take that guy out
[2:08:57] <Vyskus> @boxnavy lmao

[2:27:29] <%sumrand0> Light bloom & dynamic darkness are the two wordt graphical additions to games I can think of. best case they're occasionally annoying but worst case they actively hinder gameplay with excessive effects blinding players at certain angles
[2:27:29] <+YabbaTroll> let her run

[2:30:14] <%Taisuru> I can't believe roberto shot her in the head and then dragged her into a closet to have sex with her corpse
[2:30:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> Mr. Golf Dick man is NOT allowed in the main house lol
[2:30:27] <+AugustRei> you can delete the footage right by the third objective
[2:30:29] <%sumrand0> Climb the side and use balconies? IIRC
[2:30:55] <%anticrust> hey @PatStaresAt useful tip, as long as no one sees you shoot a camera, no one cares that it was shot or is broken
[2:31:31] <T_Sasquatch> Hmmm this camera has a bullet hole . Hmmm
[2:31:34] <marrowjuice> @TheBeanBox sounds like this match just turned into a fatal 4-way
[2:31:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> is that Freddie Mercury?
[2:32:00] <%AzureGale> Look at that not-Xbox
[2:32:01] <ThorW> I wonder when Pat will descend into "if noone is alive, it's stealth" territory

[2:32:27] <JayEarly> BUTTBOY?
[2:32:29] <justindgbz> Go out the window
[2:32:32] <%MrGuy516> the maid is allowed to take a crowbar to a secure area?
[2:32:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @JayEarly With BIG Butts
[2:32:44] <%Alazull> Check the map for a security room
[2:32:47] <MultipleJiggs> Does it show up on the map?
[2:32:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's a balcony with stairs somewhere that leads to the security room
[2:32:50] <AdmiralButtloaf> wasnt the observatory a security station
[2:32:51] <T_Sasquatch> I do appreciate npcs in this game notice general bullet impact
[2:33:00] <dukenux> i think you need a security disguise for that anyway
[2:33:04] <%anticrust> @PatStaresAt Security room is in the Lab
[2:33:07] <+Javaa01> @MrGuy516 Crowbars and other tools are considered legal items, so you can take them anywhere as anyone
[2:33:12] <+wampa661> I thought the security stuff here was in the lab area?
[2:33:13] <%Dingalow> Pat we said that in perfect unison
[2:33:13] <+Double_Tap_That> There are actually several places on this map where you can disable cameras.
[2:33:16] <%bardocckk> bardocckk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Clean shaved pat
[2:33:17] <%MoguManda> @anticrust not true
[2:33:20] <dukenux> COIN KEEP
[2:33:23] <+YabbaTroll> there are two security rooms
[2:33:24] <Kredit2Team> Oooo, Sapienza, sweet!
[2:33:25] <%bardocckk> clean pat
[2:33:28] <+glowstickglow> i think i hear a penny in the next room
[2:33:28] <%TheWinged7> they saw you
[2:33:29] <HomebaseRED> youre better off with the cleaner outfit
[2:33:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> His dik is loading
[2:33:38] <%Frost_Quill> You compromised that disguise earlier.
[2:33:42] <Meekest> I dont think they saw him
[2:33:42] <%anticrust> @MoguManda very true, theres one in the mansion as well, but the lab one is easier
[2:33:44] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Yeah cause you got caught fiddling with the grandmaphone as a guard
[2:33:45] <waywardhavoc> that means you did a crime and saw you in that outfit but you can still pass most guards
[2:33:46] <ape_hawk> that shirt is compromising you because of how awful it looks
[2:33:47] <dukenux> shame, i liked that shirt
[2:33:49] <CyberKN> You're only compromisede to the people who show up orange in Hitman vision
[2:33:59] <%sumrand0> Someone should make a 2Snacks easter egg mod that replaces a security guard with our south American friend & replaces the security cam screen display to show stills from his 2BFP animations hahaha
[2:34:15] <+CryptusMaximus> Virus in a lab under a mansion huh?
[2:34:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> This part was v hard for me
[2:34:39] <+glowstickglow> try the basement of this place
[2:34:40] <+YabbaTroll> Map!
[2:34:40] <%sumrand0> hmmm NGL basic model swaps...Screw it I'm gunna try my own hand it making that mod lol
[2:34:40] <+AugustRei> the camera room in the virus is way easier to do anyway
[2:34:43] <+wampa661> The car garage I think
[2:34:43] <%Psych_man13_13> from the basement
[2:34:45] <%Ipsenscastle> this part kind of ruins the mission for me
[2:34:49] <%Monkeyweed21> you can get to it from Francesca's room
[2:34:51] <Zebroneath> there's a cliffside entrance near where gold man looked off the cliff
[2:34:55] <Sirtimbob> Go through the sex dungeon
[2:34:55] <Zebroneath> golf*
[2:35:00] <xcompleasedad> Get yo gun?
[2:35:01] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt There's a stairway that goes down there in the west part of the manor
[2:35:02] <%sumrand0> This lab SUCKSSSSSS
[2:35:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah there's a door in the cellar
[2:35:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Give 47 a anime hair
[2:35:21] <%MoguManda> the observatory
[2:35:22] <+Javaa01> @Ipsenscastle Thankfully there is a way to do this very quickly, so you don't have to the whole song and dance with the hazmats
[2:35:24] <+tregarcia93> the gerage
[2:35:26] <+livi242> I'm not sure how I feel about the objectives like this
[2:35:31] <rafaelba93> there is like 10 ways to get there
[2:35:37] <%Monkeyweed21> near the observatory
[2:35:39] <+CryptusMaximus> big Resident Evil energy....if RE was full of spaghetti.
[2:35:47] <Sirtimbob> Next to Wetzels Pretzels
[2:35:50] <+livi242> they kinda get repetitive after awhile
[2:35:52] <%Alazull> This hairdresser has pretty free run of the place
[2:36:08] <Vyskus> are you telling me RE is NOT full of speghetti
[2:36:10] <%Ipsenscastle> @Javaa01 at least theres a shortcut
[2:36:19] <%Alazull> Tell me that car is an escape route
[2:36:21] <+glowstickglow> hitman and his infinitr pocket
[2:36:23] <justindgbz> Resident Evil: Spaghettihazard
[2:36:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Destroy the virus- with your ass

[2:36:48] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[2:36:51] <Zebroneath> @Ipsenscastle Yeah, once you find the quick method, it's stupid easy to do the virus part.

[2:37:08] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt That might've been the security room that those two guys were guarding
[2:37:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> gotta get more poison
[2:37:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Kredit2Team that's the door to the lab

[2:38:14] <Zebroneath> He already has it
[2:38:15] <dukenux> I got so scared i lost all my hair
[2:38:34] <%sumrand0> I love the idea of 47 getting discovered by a hazmat dude & 47 just reacting by poking a whole in his suit and pointing it out to the guy. like "awww man really?"
[2:38:39] <waywardhavoc> you can just dump it on the floor
[2:38:39] <suddenlyscorched> They're going to PAT you down
[2:38:41] <suddenlyscorched> haw
[2:38:45] <+glowstickglow> just drop it on the floor
[2:38:47] <waywardhavoc> guards will carry it to storage if they find it
[2:38:57] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt you can just raw drop items, you don't need to use a trash bin
[2:39:00] <anticrust> just throw it on the grounf
[2:39:01] <Profmcstevie> Store the bullets in a stranger :)
[2:39:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> EAT THE GUN
[2:39:04] <%sumrand0> @suddenlyscorched oh man.......hahaha that hurt
[2:39:09] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah because you need it so bad now that all your targets are dead LUL
[2:39:15] <%linSP> nothing suspicious about random gun

[2:39:22] <suddenlyscorched> @sumrand0 here to help
[2:39:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CryptusMaximus having it makes him feel secure
[2:39:39] <%sumrand0> @cryptusmaximus better to have it and not need it vs. need it and not have it!
[2:39:53] <+glowstickglow> FRISK PASSED +100
[2:39:58] <%anticrust> I love how frisks dont pick up the crowbar or the 100 other things in your pocket
[2:40:02] <+CryptusMaximus> @sumrand0 He has the best gun. The reload save gun.
[2:40:04] <+wampa661> Save?
[2:40:05] <suddenlyscorched> The James Bond stinger gets me EVERY TIME

[2:40:05] <Saltmeisterr> kewl
[2:40:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> This place fuckin sucks
[2:40:12] <%Dementedpenguin> I never played this game.

[2:40:15] <%ChungusQuest> goddamn that musical sting
[2:40:17] <suddenlyscorched> "Theme of Secret Evil Laboratory"
[2:40:18] <%Dementedpenguin> Is this level a remake?
[2:40:22] <%ssjklyco> this looks fun
[2:40:22] <Meekest> idk what you mean 47 looks like a nerd
[2:40:38] <+AugustRei> one of the buildings here has the surveillance
[2:40:39] <+Double_Tap_That> @Dementedpenguin Nope, just ported from HITMAN 2016
[2:40:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's a lot of people who can break your disguise in here no matter what
[2:40:46] <%Dementedpenguin> Because this looks vaguely familar
[2:40:50] <gamingspacesloth> This is the one I struggled with most in Hitman 2
[2:40:54] <%linSP> destroy that t virus
[2:40:57] <%Dementedpenguin> @Double_Tap_That oh, got it
[2:40:58] <%Ipsenscastle> wait why was Pat intent on fibre wiring everyone if he's done the level before then?
[2:41:09] <%ssjklyco> Hello, my name is Doctor Baracoda
[2:41:09] <%anticrust> Hazmat 47
[2:41:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Eat the virus for max bonus
[2:41:13] <%ChungusQuest> yo that disguise fresh as fuck
[2:41:14] <%TheWinged7> psaBlind the keycard pat
[2:41:15] <%GraceTBM> GraceTBM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Thanks for streaming Hitman! I've been fascinated with the series from afar for years, but the ability to save anywhere is a weird turn off for me. I'm happy to get to see the game, and I don't mind that you're save scumming. thanks again!
[2:41:18] <%sumrand0> The reload save gun isn't strong enough to defeat the densely packed NPC tunnels. These sections were the bane of my stealth runs since I played this before I had an SSD to reduce load times
[2:41:21] <+wampa661> this is similar to the vinyard/drug smuggling one from Blood Money yeah
[2:41:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Ipsenscastle can you kill EVERYONE?
[2:41:28] <Zebroneath> gameplay funsies
[2:41:32] <suddenlyscorched> Diana with the pre-mortem one liner
[2:41:39] <%kyh9> hard to see in those suits
[2:41:42] <%Plesin> You can just shoot it
[2:41:47] <SmartAssPawn089> This room is sick
[2:41:49] <dukenux> what if you just shoot it?
[2:41:50] <+TheMorilo> Just be good

[2:41:53] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt There's a little button in the back to distract them
[2:41:54] <%Taisuru> Hard to see in hazmat suit
[2:41:55] <CassyASG> check the room
[2:41:56] <suddenlyscorched> Give 'em the Kansas City Shuffle
[2:41:57] <Discount_CJ> I think you just do it and run
[2:41:58] <%MoguManda> look around

[2:44:40] <%sumrand0> @liquiddinosaur true but if you're referring to secure locations within the map then yes you can clear out all NPCs (IIRC) I believe civies outside secure areas are infinite but within compounds non-guards don't spawn infinitely

[2:51:32] <%sumrand0> this is why 1st run completion is supposed to just focus on success, getting better scores is easier with the first few map unlock rewards
[2:51:49] <%FluffiTamamo> I really have to start 3. I didnt wanna in case I wanted to refund cuz fuck epic but god are hitmans good.
[2:51:58] <leinadtonu> love making music
[2:51:58] <%sumrand0> Jank Jonk by Fingers
[2:52:00] <arkv01> pleaase can we go back to the E for everyone music, this is kinda grimy
[2:52:02] <Profmcstevie> I can groove to this BRB screen
[2:52:04] <%sumrand0> Fing3rs
[2:52:05] <Kredit2Team> Really helps to get to know the map also
[2:52:16] <%luketrapwalker> Holy shit I've never seen this PogChamp
[2:52:24] <leinadtonu> This song slaps
[2:52:25] <+admiral_of_crunch> Time isn't a factor unless you're shooting for leaderboards. Silent Assassin play will boost your score a ton anyways.
[2:52:27] <%Dementedpenguin> @BinaryFireball It depends, but I think you'll like the more recent ones. The earlier games were..... jank. OG Hitman 1 & 2 specifically.
[2:52:33] <Kredit2Team> There's some really stupid stuff you can get away with if you know when/where to go. :D
[2:52:35] <%Ipsenscastle> my favourite was back when he used the persona shapeshifter music
[2:52:38] <%luketrapwalker> Gief partied too hard LUL
[2:52:42] <%sumrand0> I really want Paige to force Pat to recreate their BRB screen dance now hahahaha
[2:52:44] <%Ipsenscastle> it was relaxing
[2:53:00] <leinadtonu> reload
[2:53:02] <$TallYoda08> SourPls
[2:53:04] <+nekodelic> @FluffiTamamo there are better things in life than hating epic for acting like every company ever
[2:53:08] <Profmcstevie> Recreate the BRB screen dance in Mocap so we can get it EVEN BETTER
[2:53:14] <majindusto> I miss the Volta-Bass animations.
[2:53:25] <BlackMage66652> DJ PEEPEE IN DA HOUSE
[2:53:34] <%Dementedpenguin> @BinaryFireball the AI in HM2 Silent Assassin was stupid. Like "I see you through walls.... sometimes" level of jank.
[2:53:37] <+oktavia_von> @captain_thickthighs manodYEEHAW hiiii broooo
[2:53:40] <mortificent> YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
[2:53:42] <%BoxNavy> 🎸
[2:53:42] <%sumrand0> @profmcstevie THAT WAY FANS CAN REPLACE THE BACKGROUNDS TOO!
[2:53:44] <%Alazull> Yeah but you can also hate Epic while doing those things lol
[2:53:56] <majindusto> Updated with Zangief...Just to be Replaced :(
[2:53:56] <bigben01> Pat has fallen in the toilet
[2:54:31] <leinadtonu> Pat has a lot of pee stored in his balls
[2:54:37] <%sumrand0> @alazull hating Epic is second nature IDK why people think it requires effort/focus to maintain it
[2:54:52] <%FluffiTamamo> @nekodelic I'm not hardline rallying against epic forever, but I do still have the right to think exploiting lootbox money to jail good titles is scummy.
[2:55:28] <%FluffiTamamo> Acting like 'every company' doesnt stop you from being a villain

[2:55:45] <@SSaryn> Kappa
[2:55:46] <BlackMage66652> @FluffiTamamo I told Epic to fuck off via buying Hitman 3 on PS5.
[2:55:59] <+nekodelic> @FluffiTamamo "jail" is a very loaded term when Steam would literally have the monopoly otherwise
[2:55:59] <super_robo_mg> Hi Pat!
[2:56:01] <%TheWinged7> he didnt fall in

[2:56:10] <%MidnightBurst12> he has returned
[2:56:13] <%sumrand0> Epic, Ubisoft, Ea, Activision, Bioware, etc etc these companies are all just brands everyone should hate naturally unless they enjoy bad games, broken promises, and unethical business practices
[2:56:13] <TheBeanBox> Hi Back I'm Dad

[2:56:39] <Zebroneath> Btw, there's a gameplay UI setting to show whether or not you broke Silent Assassin.
[2:56:42] <%Monkeyweed21> lockpick is high tier
[2:56:44] <%Puhff> Why are you out of breath?
[2:56:46] <Kredit2Team> The stuff with the chef is pretty fun @PatStaresAt

[2:57:07] <%Psych_man13_13> do it
[2:57:09] <jacknerik> Yeah
[2:57:09] <CyberKN> Yeah, it's a HUD indicator
[2:57:10] <aura_00> @majindusto how do you play a game that will never come out?
[2:57:11] <+Javaa01> It's under HUD options
[2:57:13] <%AncelDeLambert> this is just cementing EVEN HARDER that Agent is psychic
[2:57:16] <%machshop> yeah you can get a little icon next to the minimap
[2:57:20] <@SSaryn> it's literally just called Silent Assassin UI I think
[2:57:29] <%sumrand0> @puhff he was getting fiber wired in the bathroom, hard to piss when you're getting strangled haha
[2:57:36] <jacknerik> YEAH
[2:57:40] <jacknerik> It's GREAT
[2:57:48] <%Zeroblazex> You should go for the morgue story its a lot of points and has a great payoff
[2:57:49] <+admiral_of_crunch> It's a lovely little green until you shed blood, then it's a disappointing red.
[2:57:49] <rafaelba93> why
[2:57:51] <mortificent> YEYEYEYE
[2:57:55] <+livi242> silent Assassin hud is bad for me
[2:57:59] <%sumrand0> people get annoying about video games?! NAHHHH never NOT ONCE
[2:58:06] <nailwind> makes me want to replay blood money again
[2:58:06] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> pat how come you don't have a 30 minute long outro like woolie
[2:58:17] <+admiral_of_crunch> There are some obscure ones in this map.
[2:58:22] <%Psych_man13_13> Memory lane is real good
[2:58:23] <+nekodelic> this one is good
[2:58:25] <+CryptusMaximus> I play with no HUD because it pretty
[2:58:35] <super_robo_mg> don't forget to bring your fiber wiber
[2:58:41] <Kredit2Team> Memento and the memory thing are close to each other as well. @PatStaresAt
[2:58:48] <nailwind> pat seems hyper. who spiked his drink?
[2:58:50] <%Taisuru> Fiber Wiber
[2:58:52] <%Frost_Quill> Fiber Wiber.
[2:58:53] <DeeVee_TV> has he unlocked a lock pick yet
[2:58:57] <%sumrand0> Blood money had some AWESOME cinematic kills and locations
[2:58:58] <rafaelba93> i prefeer knife
[2:58:58] <aura_00> fibey wibey
[2:58:59] <%thetrashman_sc> its pitbull
[2:59:00] <majindusto> Fiber Whyber?
[2:59:01] <+nekodelic> @PatStaresAt always bring lockpick, best toll in the game
[2:59:05] <jacknerik> The green thing in the corner is the silent assasin thing
[2:59:07] <%UnabashedGarbage> I can't tell if Pat is saying fiber wiber on purpose or not
[2:59:23] <%Dementedpenguin> @sumrand0 I had too much fun with the casino level. LUL
[2:59:27] <+hrodbehrat> Punch someone
[2:59:28] <%sumrand0> @unabashedgarbage he doesn't know either
[2:59:35] <%Psych_man13_13> Also, why would you never not take a lockpick?
[2:59:36] <+Double_Tap_That> Yeah, they reuse it like 4 times
[2:59:40] <ravioli_ronin> When they reboot this again, 47’s gonna have a QR code on his head
[2:59:48] <+captain_thickthighs> assain seems like a good job all expense paid to location and you can fuil it at your pace for a flat fee.
[2:59:49] <+admiral_of_crunch> This is a fun map. The town is fun, and gets repurposed in fun ways in side missions. The virus objective ends up taking some obnoxious extra time on the replay, but there're some appreciated speedrun strats. I'd put it at maybe the third, second best map in Hitman 2016, personally.
[2:59:50] <%king_wragles> @UnabashedGarbage it's not, but if you call him out on it he'll start doing it on purpose to 'trick' us
[2:59:51] <+Kataiser> You should be flagged as suspicious for entering a hair salon.
[2:59:52] <%BinaryFireball> i should really tell you this
[2:59:54] <%BinaryFireball> here are the dets
[2:59:56] <DeeVee_TV> "I need a trim"
[3:00:02] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah there's a reason they remixed this location like 4 or 5 times. So much space to work with.
[3:00:03] <%Ellila> A good cover. A 10000% bald man sitting in a barbershop
[3:00:06] <%UnabashedGarbage> What is a completely bald man doing at hair salon?
[3:00:09] <%Jekado> why would he be in a barber shop....
[3:00:09] <+hrodbehrat> Agent 47 needs dome chrome
[3:00:10] <thelonechris> Nobody cares that a strange man with a barcode tattoo on his head just walked in and is standing there listening to them
[3:00:12] <Arek_1> @Kataiser LUL
[3:00:15] <%BinaryFireball> to do what?
[3:00:19] <+Baekon01> to stare

[3:00:27] <+YabbaTroll> be jealous
[3:00:27] <%Piemen99> Pat would know
[3:00:27] <+paladinstarbuster> You wouldknow
[3:00:29] <Meekest> Hes a detective
[3:00:29] <nailwind> shoot all bald people on sight
[3:00:31] <Kredit2Team> He's a PI
[3:00:31] <+nekodelic> he's a detective
[3:00:32] <aura_00> a bald dude enters a barbershop and just stands there for 10 sec without a word
[3:00:32] <jacknerik> He's a detective
[3:00:33] <+YabbaTroll> he's a detective
[3:00:33] <ravioli_ronin> Like at least put some concealer on the barcode or smth
[3:00:35] <Arek_1> To dream.
[3:00:35] <DeeVee_TV> he detects you are sus
[3:00:36] <%Psych_man13_13> 47 doesn't have a hair on his body
[3:00:36] <%BubbaRands> a shave, waxing and shampoo
[3:00:38] <mortificent> cause he's bald
[3:00:39] <%ssjklyco> You have a bar code on the back of your head
[3:00:39] <theanora1> that's how they got bald
[3:00:47] <rosemon5001> i mean you could allways use a sander to polish the head
[3:00:50] <%JJCheeker> Where is this mission
[3:00:57] <%sumrand0> @dementedpenguin personally the house party on the side of a cliff was always a riot with the glass bottom hot tub & massive number of killable NPCs you could stuff in the bathroom hahahha

[3:01:43] <aura_00> NOBODY LIKES SNITCHES MAAM
[3:01:47] <%Dementedpenguin> @sumrand0 I stuffed that hot tub with as many bodies as I could and watch the game nearly break when I shot the glass LUL

[3:03:00] <+karmahoudini_guitar> when did Hitman 2 originally come out
[3:03:05] <DeeVee_TV> man the gun with the 'make people vomit' darts is so OP in this game
[3:03:06] <+admiral_of_crunch> @DappercatEsquire Once upon a time the whole Hitman 1/2 gold edition super bundle was on the Humble Monthly Choice, indeed. It was radical value.
[3:03:06] <+nekodelic> @DappercatEsquire I would say "not long ago", but the way I experience time has been fucked by the pandemic
[3:03:16] <aura_00> dark secluded alleys are great
[3:03:18] <jacknerik> @karmahoudini_guitar 2018 I think
[3:03:20] <%Broand> So wait is this the same mission but from different entry points and objectives?

[3:03:25] <%pokefan9956> how long he been playin
[3:03:28] <%Dakuu75> Question: in ANY of the hitman games, is it possible to put on an assassin's creed hood and use a hidden blade to kill a target?

[3:03:47] <%Frost_Quill> @Broand Yeah there are multiple ways to do these.
[3:03:50] <%sumrand0> @dementedpenguin OMG THAT'S RIGHT I forgot how badly the game died when you had a dozen or more people die/ragdoll at the same time hahaha that was always hilarious especially when you do it dressed as Santa Claus
[3:03:57] <%FluffiTamamo> HAS
[3:03:58] <Profmcstevie> One map in Hitman has MANY missions and approaches, that's how these are designed

[3:06:09] <SomeAsianDood> And now you can do them in vr!
[3:06:09] <EuropanLamprey> Good thing this guy doesn't turn around ever
[3:06:12] <+admiral_of_crunch> I spent a fucking hour out here in the city the first time I played this map, just trying to slowly figure everything out.
[3:06:12] <%HunguyTV> HunguyTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:06:17] <nailwind> these streets look so gorgeous. i wouldnt be able to take a step without screening 5 times/sec
[3:06:19] <%Dementedpenguin> The series has come a long way since the first game. That game has NOT aged well.
[3:06:23] <super_robo_mg> push him down the well :D
[3:06:29] <+Javaa01> @mortificent Well that and one of the mission story kills in the 2016 levels is literally a word for word remaking of a part of Dr. No
[3:06:34] <%FluffiTamamo> it'd be so easy nyannDere
[3:06:36] <%Dakuu75> the level of detail and graphical fidelity is really nice. but, I assume that's because you go through the levels so slow, the game has time to load everything
[3:06:40] <%Taisuru> Smoking over a well seems SUPER shitty
[3:06:42] <nailwind> @Dementedpenguin remember the jungle action shooter level?
[3:06:44] <aura_00> the fuck?
[3:06:55] <+CryptusMaximus> save and push him

[3:07:52] <+YabbaTroll> your save scumming is destabilizing this timeline
[3:07:53] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[3:08:04] <+Double_Tap_That> There's a washroom nearby where you can create a distraction
[3:08:05] <rafaelba93> smooth
[3:08:06] <%Taisuru> LUL
[3:08:16] <DeeVee_TV> i thought he goes to this nearby restroom
[3:08:18] <%Taisuru> TIME TRAVEL DETECTING CAR
[3:08:22] <%sumrand0> @dementedpenguin 100% agree, the initial playthrough was just one long fanboy freakout as each level improved on the spectacular location variety and the diversity of special assassination methods. No joke I watch the credits roll during the funeral and thought, "bummer ending" only to immediately hear that's not the only ending. I actually shouted "OMG that's f'ing cool" when I played the funeral "correctly" on a second attempt
[3:08:30] <%Monkeyweed21> you can use the bathroom
[3:08:32] <aura_00> this game has some of the weirdest dialogue i've ever seen
[3:08:34] <nailwind> monkaS creepy old man
[3:08:49] <+Troispoint> It took God some save scumming to allow video games to happen
[3:08:51] <%Dakuu75> the next Hitman game should be super easy and feature everyone wearing masks because of the pandemic
[3:08:57] <BlkFlameKami> ?
[3:08:57] <%Taisuru> Bugged out?
[3:09:07] <+Javaa01> If only you had a syringe that could make this man violently shit his guts out and go to the bathroom
[3:09:15] <TheHeroAppears> is pat being bad at the video game
[3:09:17] <justindgbz> You have to restart, you missed the opportunity
[3:09:17] <DeeVee_TV> monkaS no
[3:09:19] <thelonechris> Nah man
[3:09:21] <+wampa661> try throwing a coin near him to trigger some movement?
[3:09:23] <+Troispoint> You're supposed to snipe him at that point maybe
[3:09:27] <clockworkidiot> The wet bandits strike again
[3:09:27] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt He's waiting for a contact to show up
[3:09:28] <bigben01> LUL LUL LUL
[3:09:29] <%Valdorick> "Not saying anything? YOU DID IT!"
[3:09:29] <Arek_1> monkaS
[3:09:30] <+paladinstarbuster> or maybe YOU did it
[3:09:37] <+CryptusMaximus> I've had NPC's bug out and stay in one spot. Seems to be caused by save scumming.
[3:09:38] <%Taisuru> Throw a coin into the well so he chases after it
[3:09:44] <+MillerLowlife> hes supposed to keep moving something bugged out
[3:09:46] <CassyASG> you shouldve gotten him going up the stars
[3:09:50] <DeeVee_TV> car alarm broke him
[3:09:50] <%sumrand0> has Pat not tried throwing an object to force the AI to change it's pattern
[3:09:51] <%Taisuru> It just bugged out lol
[3:09:54] <%Dakuu75> your saves have RNG?!! lol
[3:09:55] <+PikeBot> He's supposed to keep moving after that phone conversation yeah. I think that car alarm or whatever threw him out of his routine
[3:10:01] <Kredit2Team> Now's your chance!
[3:10:02] <primarch_lupercal> yea this has been a problem since the first game
[3:10:14] <%BoxNavy> pee on him
[3:10:20] <%Dementedpenguin> @sumrand0 agreed (to the previous post)
[3:10:21] <%Taisuru> Iconic pat catch phrase "Pee pee time"
[3:10:22] <+CryptusMaximus> AI pathing is hard guys
[3:10:23] <TheHeroAppears> do you think his clothes are covered in piss now
[3:10:26] <%FluffiTamamo> Choking a man mid-stream. Uncool.
[3:10:26] <nailwind> strange, the man suddenly is bald
[3:10:32] <aura_00> pee pee time is also bet time for strangle

[3:10:40] <%Huntercd> That man just peed himself
[3:10:42] <CassyASG> you can easily mess up pathing in hitman games
[3:10:43] <+MillerLowlife> oh what woah i followed this guy so many times and he never actually went in that bathroom that wouldve helped so much
[3:10:44] <%Frost_Quill> BORK
[3:10:47] <+Pengers> bork bork
[3:10:49] <%Dakuu75> if this was Cyberpunk, I bet you'd take his underwear too and we'd see his big NPC-penis flop around
[3:10:50] <%PanicSwytch> Oh lawd he comin
[3:10:50] <%Valdorick> Try to not think about the fact you're in his piss stained clothes
[3:10:53] <justindgbz> Did you get his phone?

[3:11:45] <ape_hawk> francesca is HORRIBLE at recognizing bald dudes she knows
[3:11:53] <peachy996> Inconspicuous
[3:11:53] <%Huntercd> Who wears a labcoat in public?
[3:11:55] <SomeAsianDood> "accidently"
[3:12:00] <%Frost_Quill> Shooting the inflatable alligators is a thing.
[3:12:02] <%Dakuu75> stab her, with her own high-heel-shoes
[3:12:05] <%sumrand0> She sure does!
[3:12:07] <%Monkeyweed21> she just hired this guy
[3:12:07] <+MillerLowlife> 47 is a master of disguise
[3:12:09] <Kredit2Team> De Santis has met with this person multiple times, and she goes "looking slightly out of place". What the hell
[3:12:12] <%MidnightBurst12> you're just that good Kappa
[3:12:12] <rafaelba93> dont worry about it
[3:12:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @Huntercd jackasses
[3:12:13] <%Taisuru> He got a haircut
[3:12:15] <%sumrand0> Not that well apparently
[3:12:17] <+InvertableQuasar> People in hitman are all pretty face blind
[3:12:20] <peachy996> The disguis is too good
[3:12:21] <pi_in_the_sci> you underestimate 47s mastery of disguise
[3:12:26] <Kredit2Team> Gank time
[3:12:26] <%FluffiTamamo> But could 47 disguise himself as Pat?
[3:12:39] <%Frost_Quill> Does she? Caruso knows him, but has she met him?
[3:12:40] <%SirGO0SE> he must be wearing the same cologne
[3:12:40] <%Dakuu75> why is she talking so fucking slow?
[3:12:42] <notsoy> no, too tall
[3:12:44] <+YabbaTroll> both are bald
[3:12:48] <thelonechris> I don't get why they would choose the most suspicious looking guy to be a master of deception
[3:12:50] <%FluffiTamamo> Can you really replicate the radiant orb?
[3:12:56] <rafaelba93> @fluffitamamo you sure thats pat?
[3:12:56] <T_Sasquatch> Lemme smash
[3:13:01] <%sumrand0> Master Of Disguise = The REAL Hitman movie
[3:13:04] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> She's a really bad sy huh
[3:13:11] <%Valdorick> Nice one liner, 47
[3:13:12] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> spy*
[3:13:34] <Kredit2Team> Haha, gun goes brrr
[3:13:35] <+admiral_of_crunch> Might wanna move all that blood
[3:13:38] <+Double_Tap_That> ACCIDENT!
[3:13:40] <%Taisuru> DO YOU MIND SHE FELL IN THE GARBAGE AND GOT STRANGLED BY THE GARBAGE
[3:13:42] <%baka_sugoi> OH NO
[3:13:42] <%FluffiTamamo> @rafaelba93 y-yes? veiS
[3:13:42] <CappuccinoGuil> "She tripped and fell into the bullet!"
[3:13:46] <%Valdorick> She fell on that gun that isn't registered in her name!
[3:13:46] <+MillerLowlife> shot herself twice in the back how sad
[3:13:46] <BoneBagMel> She fell into those bullets I swear
[3:13:46] <%BinaryFireball> she accidentially was shot by the dumpster hamsters
[3:13:47] <peachy996> In da trash
[3:13:48] <mortificent> ACCIDENTAL DOUBLE TAP
[3:13:48] <Meekest> Man I would not want my body with all those flies
[3:13:48] <nailwind> she slipped
[3:13:49] <+Troispoint> She fell into a garbage can and got shot by accident
[3:13:51] <thelonechris> You accidentally put the gun to her head and your finger slipped
[3:13:51] <%BinaryFireball> oh nooo
[3:13:51] <+InvertableQuasar> She tripped and fell on some bullets and then into the dumpster!
[3:13:51] <%WhereIsWill> shit happens LUL
[3:13:51] <%sumrand0> always love the classic silenced shot in the back, quick, quiet & effective.
[3:13:53] <xeros720> you just accidented that guy
[3:13:57] <%Dakuu75> would there not be security cameras in a place like this?
[3:14:00] <+Kataiser> You can smash that wall to open the lab from here BTW. Cool trick
[3:14:01] <T_Sasquatch> Pat the blood
[3:14:02] <%Monkeyweed21> memory lanes is a good one
[3:14:12] <AdmiralButtloaf> Dr. Pepp
[3:14:18] <%Huntercd> Isn't that guard concerned?
[3:14:21] <%Dementedpenguin> Quick, find a Kool Aid man disguise
[3:14:27] <+Troispoint> This is when you spray a batman logo gel and blow up the wall
[3:14:27] <+CryptusMaximus> Man, 47 has had the same voice actor for literally 21 years.
[3:14:28] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt You need a breaching charge or other type of explosive to get through that
[3:14:28] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Punch through it like Deus Ex?
[3:14:29] <%Broand> So do you learn more of the story with each method of muder?
[3:14:29] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> More like hit man poo
[3:14:30] <xeros720> can you just throw shit at it?
[3:14:30] <%Valdorick> Those guards SUCK
[3:14:32] <thelonechris> ?
[3:14:33] <%sumrand0> Call the Koolaid man, he'll bash down the wall for ya
[3:14:34] <T_Sasquatch> Ied probably
[3:14:35] <%BinaryFireball> wouldnt the bullet go straight through her?
[3:14:36] <Broken_Sonex> OH NO SHE FELL INTO THE DUMPSTER AND LANDED ON SOME BULLETS
[3:14:40] <+nekodelic> you go BOOM
[3:14:40] <rafaelba93> explosives
[3:14:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> explosives?
[3:14:45] <+admiral_of_crunch> "There was a silenced pistol in the garbage and when she tripped into the garbage the gun went off twice and pierced through her heart with efficacious precision."
[3:14:46] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt Propane will do the trick
[3:14:50] <+Kataiser> Propane tank works wonders
[3:14:50] <Bluewolf544> Did paige break AGAIN ?
[3:14:50] <%sumrand0> HEY KOOLAID!!!!!
[3:14:54] <%Dakuu75> ram the dumbster through it?
[3:14:56] <%FluffiTamamo> an extinguisher will do just fine too
[3:14:59] <%Monkeyweed21> you can get breaching charges
[3:15:00] <ape_hawk> HANK HILL HIM TO DEATH
[3:15:02] <mortificent> DANG IT BOBBY
[3:15:02] <rafaelba93> its bice to escape
[3:15:05] <xeros720> pro PAIN
[3:15:06] <nailwind> so considerate
[3:15:08] <+CryptusMaximus> there's a golf ball in your apartment that'll do it
[3:15:13] <%AzureGale> Propane? More like PRO-PAIN
[3:15:16] <%Valdorick> The poop hole
[3:15:18] <+Double_Tap_That> Check it out
[3:15:19] <bigben01> PENNYWISE LIVES DOWN THERE
[3:15:27] <+TheMorilo> this level is fucking massive
[3:15:29] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt Time for cursed easter egg in the sewer?
[3:15:29] <+admiral_of_crunch> Gonna go stomp goombas
[3:15:30] <%sumrand0> Stab her with Propane & Propane accessories
[3:15:37] <+MillerLowlife> bald men trespassing in my sewer again
[3:15:38] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Go swimming
[3:15:38] <ape_hawk> ...who the fuck puts a sewer line next to a public beach?
[3:15:38] <%Valdorick> "Everything accidents down here" - Hitman unvierse Pennywise
[3:15:39] <%sumrand0> him
[3:15:41] <rafaelba93> go around yeah
[3:15:42] <SomeAsianDood> @BinaryFireball tbf hitman probably uses hollow point so that the bullet frags and stays in the body
[3:15:44] <Bluewolf544> Theres a lab down there
[3:15:46] <SomeAsianDood> wouldn't be surprising
[3:15:57] <thelonechris> The actual detective is probably going to get blamed for her death
[3:15:57] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> There’s probably a pipe by the ocean
[3:16:08] <+admiral_of_crunch> Does the Sanguine store even have a purpose in the base mission?
[3:16:13] <%Valdorick> This mission is amazing... except that fucking virus. Fuck that thing.
[3:16:16] <+Pengers> virus big go pls
[3:16:18] <rafaelba93> noice
[3:16:19] <xeros720> save us all from the virus, Agent Pat
[3:16:22] <+admiral_of_crunch> SHOOT THE VARUS WIT THE GUN
[3:16:23] <%bhp_99> you can get rid of security cams while you're at it
[3:16:24] <+nekodelic> NOOO
[3:16:29] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> A shark will tell u how to get on so go swimming
[3:16:33] <+YabbaTroll> ???
[3:16:39] <+livi242> l
[3:16:40] <%Dakuu75> eat the virus to gain its power
[3:16:43] <+YabbaTroll> oh ok
[3:16:44] <Bluewolf544> Man these missions are so reminiscent of blood money in a weird way
[3:16:44] <+nekodelic> you get Silent Assassin back after you delete the footage @PatStaresAt
[3:16:48] <+Double_Tap_That> Deleting the security footage restores SA
[3:16:53] <+KeyToLifesEther> Is this blind?
[3:17:02] <%Frost_Quill> Deleting the footage gets you silent assassin again.
[3:17:03] <Kredit2Team> I wish they came to investigate the broken cameras like in Phantom Pain
[3:17:05] <super_robo_mg> save scumming is easier
[3:17:07] <%sumrand0> @someasiandood hollow point reduced powder shells would be ineffective beyond short range but definitely be quieter and less likely to pass through targets so that would make sense
[3:17:14] <rafaelba93> there is a stalagitite right above the virus...
[3:17:23] <justindgbz> You can shoot stalactites above the virus building to destroy it
[3:17:40] <ape_hawk> wow, now 47 looks like a nerd
[3:17:42] <+admiral_of_crunch> Does the standard ICA have the stopping power to shoot through the glass and hit the virus? Or do you need to utilize bullshit to get it dusted quick?
[3:17:44] <+paladinstarbuster> Hey dude you get a haircut
[3:17:46] <super_robo_mg> good thing there are so many man-size bins sitting around
[3:17:46] <thelonechris> LUL

[3:17:52] <%Piemen99> heh
[3:17:53] <CassyASG> @KeyToLifesEther yes he just beat this level and is trying again
[3:17:55] <%Valdorick> Inside this lab are some crates with acid in it. You can place bodies in them. This counts as hiding them *AND* instantly kills silent assassin, so... heads up.
[3:17:58] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> has pat foudn the poison yet?
[3:17:59] <thelonechris> I like how they weren't even sure
[3:18:00] <Arek_1> LUL

[3:18:05] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[3:18:06] <+admiral_of_crunch> I mean, with the stalactites
[3:18:08] <%Dementedpenguin> Hitman games can be very.... cheeky sometimes LUL
[3:18:11] <rafaelba93> @admiral_of_crunch a sniper would do it
[3:18:16] <T_Sasquatch> 🐰
[3:18:25] <DeeVee_TV> You can shoot the virus if you are a good shot :)
[3:18:28] <majindusto> Ain't I a Stinker?
[3:18:31] <%Huntercd> Are they really not going to notice the scientist became this tall bald man?
[3:18:32] <+YabbaTroll> @Valdorick shhhh
[3:18:34] <%Taisuru> Second Verse, same as the first
[3:18:44] <+admiral_of_crunch> @rafaelba93 Just the rifle, then? I never tried with anything else. Would the Silverballers work?
[3:18:48] <Zebroneath> yes
[3:18:52] <dukenux> took the wrong turn at albuqoiqee
[3:18:57] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt You can see it from the right side of the lab from the ground floor
[3:18:57] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> literally looking at it
[3:19:00] <CyberKN> You can only see it from the other side of the lab
[3:19:08] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[3:19:16] <+admiral_of_crunch> "WHO'S SHOOTING?"
[3:19:17] <%BinaryFireball> you there! no shooting guns at the cieling here!!
[3:19:17] <mortificent> Bites the Dust!!
[3:19:18] <aura_00> "47, your next target is the Tazmanian Devil"
[3:19:18] <%Taisuru> Other side
[3:19:22] <%Dakuu75> that impressive
[3:19:26] <%BoxNavy> whats happening :)
[3:19:36] <%sumrand0> What huh where? shit time to dump the clip!
[3:19:38] <+CryptusMaximus> make sure you make the virus's death look like an accident
[3:19:41] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt You can only see it from behind the lab, NE corner
[3:19:45] <rafaelba93> from the side of the base iirc
[3:19:52] <rafaelba93> other side*
[3:20:01] <%sumrand0> Gaslight the virus, trick it into killing itself!
[3:20:10] <+admiral_of_crunch> Not suspicious at all
[3:20:28] <%Taisuru> Sneaky Steve the Scientist what's the problem?
[3:20:35] <%BinaryFireball> if you eat it all then you have nothing to worry about. Virus ded
[3:20:44] <+Double_Tap_That> Disguise yourself as the virus and kill Caruso.
[3:20:51] <+admiral_of_crunch> Just CONSUME the varus
[3:21:02] <rafaelba93> look up
[3:21:03] <+admiral_of_crunch> Become. Osmosis Jones
[3:21:06] <%Frost_Quill> I didn't know that was there.
[3:21:14] <%BoxNavy> yeah :)
[3:21:19] <%AzureGale> Hay guise whats going on in this secret lab
[3:21:21] <bigben01> VARUS
[3:21:23] <rafaelba93> not that one
[3:21:24] <Discount_CJ> Because the wire underneath
[3:21:27] <+TheMorilo> it breaks some tubes
[3:21:27] <%BinaryFireball> well if you play with your dick the virus becomes confused as well
[3:21:28] <%Dakuu75> well, let's find out
[3:21:29] <%TheWinged7> probably descrtoys the hvac unit
[3:21:31] <%sumrand0> Just walk into the containment room you dont need protection, the masks DO NOTHING!
[3:21:32] <Kredit2Team> Isn't there on right above the virus building?
[3:21:33] <justindgbz> There's a different one, kinda hard to see
[3:21:34] <%BinaryFireball> so confused it dies
[3:21:37] <+craftyraichu> Does it hit some power lines or something?
[3:21:38] <rafaelba93> there is one exacly above it
[3:21:39] <+MillerLowlife> you use it as a club to beat the virus with obviously
[3:21:40] <Zebroneath> it's directly abobe the virus

[3:23:21] <Zebroneath> It's fun how speedrunners trigger an explosion above the stalagmite to make if fall.

[3:32:30] <Broken_Sonex> @T_Sasquatch It's his stand.

[3:32:48] <@commanderclaw> Remember that time a Silent Hill wiki editor got super mad about circumcision?
[3:32:51] <Slim_Lipid> mass murderer named "The circumciser"
[3:33:01] <%Taisuru> He's a dickhead, only a circumcision knife will defeat him
[3:33:06] <Calamity2007> So the entirety of Hitman 1 is in Hitman 2 right?
[3:33:12] <+PikeBot> I like how it's a betamax deck
[3:33:17] <+Double_Tap_That> Why not take both? Your inventory space is infinite.
[3:33:17] <%Valdorick> Correct
[3:33:20] <Zebroneath> still looks fine
[3:33:21] <%sumrand0> @calamity2007 yeap
[3:33:25] <+admiral_of_crunch> @CryptusMaximus It's definitely better, but it's still fucky as it. If there is direct line of sight between you and a guard who witnesses the shot, they will spot you instantaneously, but it won't show up anywhere on the hud. So I ended up failing the Sniper Assassin challenges over and over again because I'd be noted as spotted, without actually being aware of it.
[3:33:25] <Grennold> Pat Boivin, reaper of foreskins 4Head
[3:33:28] <%AzureGale> Dickman is going to circumcise his target
[3:33:31] <%BinaryFireball> damn that is some stillness

[3:33:43] <%Frost_Quill> Save before he gets there.

[3:34:24] <%Ipsenscastle> circumcision is so weird, how did it become widespread to do unnecessary genital surgery to babies
[3:34:25] <%Valdorick> Correct, on every platform but PC LUL
[3:34:26] <+brightman42> it is really weird isn't it
[3:34:27] <+thechungiestofbois> He has horrific mommy issues
[3:34:29] <primarch_lupercal> family memories
[3:34:29] <%sumrand0> Eh not as fucked up as the murders high schoolers commit these days. 47 is practically a pacifist compared to troubled teens haha
[3:34:31] <ToneBacas> euro movies, man
[3:34:32] <+Gamefriendly> I thought you needed to own the previous ones in order to get their content in the newer ones
[3:34:32] <Grennold> You could probably kill him with that beak tbh
[3:34:33] <dukenux> SourPls
[3:34:36] <%ssjklyco> That songs not copyrighted, is it?
[3:34:36] <+thechungiestofbois> it's a family video
[3:34:37] <%BinaryFireball> 47 ways........
[3:34:38] <peachy996> It's something
[3:34:38] <+admiral_of_crunch> Some Spanish Italian shit I dunno
[3:34:39] <dukenux> 47 ways
[3:34:41] <CassyASG> is it a music video
[3:34:42] <+Dova573> Sounds like an 80s movie montage
[3:34:45] <ravioli_ronin> I love copyrighted music
[3:34:46] <%BoxNavy> i love european sex music
[3:34:48] <+Dova573> I love it
[3:34:49] <Broken_Sonex> EU movies man....
[3:34:51] <SomeAsianDood> It's italian I guess
[3:34:52] <pilllowofbees> WTF is this song LUL
[3:34:52] <dukenux> This could have a killer italo disco remix
[3:34:53] <+CryptusMaximus> @admiral_of_crunch Honestly your game sounds buggy if that's the case. Sniper Assassin is my preferred way to play when doing Suit Only runs and I don't have issues like that unless I'm super close to them. In which case, yeah obviously I'd get spotted.
[3:34:53] <Kredit2Team> Thankfully he's a dummy and sends away his guards
[3:35:00] <Kredit2Team> Makes it too ez

[3:35:32] <%Huntercd> circumcision is not great
[3:35:32] <%BinaryFireball> thats a good sauce
[3:35:33] <+YabbaTroll> Accident!
[3:35:34] <%AzureGale> THAT was cinematic
[3:35:34] <%sumrand0> ah yeah the creepy PMV the dude made for his dead family. Perfectly well adjust. yUp.
[3:35:39] <%Valdorick> Aw, he cut his PP before he could cry about his brother being a chad.
[3:35:39] <@SSaryn> don't cut pp tho
[3:35:41] <dukenux> CBT Killer
[3:35:41] <CassyASG> they are hide body
[3:35:43] <bigben01> HIDE THE BODY
[3:35:46] <Saltmeisterr> ACCIDENT
[3:35:47] <Kredit2Team> Oof, when they come to search for their master. They'll find his pp wont be there anymore.
[3:35:48] <jacknerik> Hide the body pat
[3:35:49] <+Double_Tap_That> Hide his body or you might lose SA.
[3:35:50] <%Taisuru> JUMP
[3:35:53] <+Javaa01> Uh maybe stuff him in a box before his guards find him
[3:35:57] <Kredit2Team> "Who would do this!"
[3:36:01] <T_Sasquatch> Bruh.
[3:36:03] <lennyrager> What i miss
[3:36:04] <CassyASG> it ruins SA if you dont
[3:36:04] <%Ranryu692> because they'll never notice all the blood LUL
[3:36:06] <%BinaryFireball> someone remind me why he doesnt get his head tattoo removed?
[3:36:07] <Midnight188> dress the body up as the plague doctor
[3:36:07] <dukenux> what's the point, theres a huge blood stain on the wall
[3:36:14] <%sumrand0> But where? it's not like giant crates exist just to stuff bodies inside them
[3:36:17] <aura_00> he stabbed his dick while watching the movie
[3:36:22] <shoobieredgrave> Killing a dude with a circumcision knife while he mourns his dead mom is weirdly poetic

[3:37:26] <+admiral_of_crunch> @CryptusMaximus Yeah. my experience was a bit jank. There would be an invisible state between unspotted and suspicious/compromised that wasn't reflected anywhere in-game outside of the challenge failing at the end. The only tell is people inexplicably shooting at you from really, really far away.
[3:37:29] <@SSaryn> Listen, he slipped and fell all the way into the crate

[3:48:08] <+admiral_of_crunch> It's funny to think of 47 as the kinda guy to purposefully go out of his way to pull off all these neato mission stories. Like, he sneaks in one way, but then leaves so he can sneak back in another way, but because it's the only thing that makes him feel anything.
[3:48:11] <%MelBrooksKA> @arduousScavenger But what if we have surprise pirates?

[3:51:46] <+LordSDB> Wha, Pat did you forget the person behind you?!!? LUL
[3:51:52] <%sumrand0> Kidney punches the silent assassinations technique of legend
[3:51:54] <SaltyAzteca> @CryptusMaximus Well boy, dont I feel silly KappaRoss

[3:52:12] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> I just imagine her tumblind down the stairs and bonking on everything making tons of noise
[3:52:14] <+admiral_of_crunch> The scientist lady went up to check on him after you KO'ed him
[3:52:28] <+admiral_of_crunch> And by that I mean she was his replacement
[3:52:33] <+LordSDB> That was great regardless Pat and really funny

[3:53:11] <Profmcstevie> She fell into my hands officer, the hand marks are an accident
[3:53:11] <%sumrand0> Slip & falls are the #1 cause of workman's comp claims. BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU WALK

[3:53:21] <%twoto858> She fell down the stairs and her body clipped itself into a crate
[3:53:35] <jacknerik> @alcors_wisdom you must not know how pat plays this game
[3:53:35] <arduousScavenger> @sumrand0 The Deadly Half Inch
[3:53:37] <heartlesshealer> Can't let your yellow SLURP meter fill up while you escape
[3:53:37] <%Huntercd> Heels are dangerous
[3:53:50] <+admiral_of_crunch> Man, what if that Ko'ed guy wakes up before someone finds her? He'll look preeeetty sus
[3:54:01] <%LVDoomien> LVDoomien subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! hey Pat I recently got prescribed meds for my anxiety/OCD and I wanted to know if I could ask you if your symptoms escalated over your lifetime or were they static? this is new for me
[3:54:02] <%twoto858> Nice
[3:54:10] <%sumrand0> @arduousscavenger hey! someone else who's suffered through too many safety training courses

[3:54:39] <%Breaknoon> accident prone people man
[3:54:40] <%Frost_Quill> I think she saw you?
[3:54:41] <heartlesshealer> You don't get to control the speed of her fall if it's not a grapple
[3:54:45] <%LVDoomien> alright I'll catch yall on the vod
[3:54:46] <%bhp_99> save
[3:54:48] <CassyASG> you cant fire shots in the old ones you could
[3:54:51] <+Javaa01> Someone down stairs saw her get shot in the head
[3:54:52] <$Memdosu> someone saw the body/kill is what broke it
[3:55:04] <arduousScavenger> "I AM GOING ON BREAK"
[3:55:06] <+PikeBot> Only being seen doing a crime (by someone other than a target), killing non-targets, and having bodies found breaks silent assassin. Oh and being on film when you leave the level.,
[3:55:15] <SaltyAzteca> saaaave
[3:55:22] <%Breaknoon> salud
[3:55:23] <jacknerik> @alcors_wisdom He replays each mission tons of times to master them before moving on to the next. On the podcast he mentioned he spent 17 hours on Paris + ICA training alone

[3:55:52] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt Security room is on second floor of manor, south side
[3:55:58] <%twoto858> Does the camera recording matter?
[3:56:02] <%Taisuru> Down in the lab wasn't it?
[3:56:04] <Zebroneath> Oh yeah, there's four camera deletions in this map
[3:56:10] <arduousScavenger> @Taisuru That's what you get for having sex on the Dahir Insaat Earthquake Bed.
[3:56:14] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt Next to a rooftop terrace

[3:57:25] <gitdweezzy> behind
[3:57:29] <+CryptusMaximus> Through that window a little further back on that terrace
[3:57:31] <+Alopekis> I can't believe Pat would hit a man.
[3:57:54] <dead_harmony13> this floor is filled with enforcers for some reason
[3:57:55] <arduousScavenger> "Some days you just CAN'T get rid of a body!"
[3:57:57] <%MelBrooksKA> No down stair guards allowed upstairs
[3:58:01] <+admiral_of_crunch> Just drag this fucko past some glass doors
[3:58:05] <%linSP> if the name of the game was hitwoman paige would love it
[3:58:05] <%craigb31> Throw him over the edge
[3:58:09] <%mostbrokenrobo> just put a bottle in his hand and leave him on the couch
[3:58:09] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt You can get in the sec room from a window
[3:58:21] <$Memdosu> did he break SA from a camera?
[3:58:23] <Saltmeisterr> m'lady

[3:59:18] <%Breaknoon> where's the safe?
[3:59:24] <%Taisuru> *Pat stress noises*
[3:59:27] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt Safe combo for the memento I think
[3:59:32] <Kiaayo> @PatStaresAt you having trouble breathing there, buddy?
[3:59:40] <+Alopekis> Is this actual HITMAN 2 or is this HITMAN 3 but the HITMAN 2 version?
[3:59:43] <CuttleCrow> where the leaning window guard is
[3:59:44] <Zebroneath> There's a window near the previous balcony that goes to the security room
[3:59:46] <CyberKN> terrace
[3:59:48] <jacknerik> By the window next to the stairs
[3:59:54] <CyberKN> @Alopekis 2

[4:00:40] <CuttleCrow> you can get it from outside, on the balcony
[4:00:40] <+CryptusMaximus> Just save and run through everywhere then reload the save when you know where it is LUL
[4:00:46] <Kredit2Team> @PatStaresAt Get in through the outside, hop through a window
[4:00:48] <+Alopekis> Oh cool. New elusive target is coming and there's some snow ninja looking thing coming up for HITMAN 3.

[4:01:42] <+CryptusMaximus> This layout's fucking confusing to be fair. I think Spencer designed this shit too.
[4:01:49] <%MelBrooksKA> the ruff
[4:01:51] <CuttleCrow> that room is always such a pain for me

[4:03:20] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Have you ever watched Kyle Bosman play this game? You'd have an aneurysm LUL
[4:03:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @scrimscromble sounds like a fun game have one guy be a hitman then another guy be the anti hit man and they have to sabatoge eachother each passthrough
[4:03:36] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt When you subdue enemies from cover, they never become a witness
[4:03:41] <+admiral_of_crunch> If you subdue someone from cover the victim won't ever see you. Even if they see your whole ass grab them
[4:03:46] <%Taisuru> @PatStaresAt How about Dan Rykert?

[4:29:50] <%AdamElJefe> Cheer500 I'm confused why everyone thinks that Chemist is going to be the new healer when they've already shown us Necromancer. I'm more convinced that Necromancer will be the new healing class.
[4:29:50] <%BinaryFireball> fucked up content wise?
[4:29:53] <+brightman42> the first 4 games have weird controls
[4:29:55] <bleugh> 47 quote
[4:29:56] <Zeikier> I STILL get them and I graduated 8 years ago
[4:30:00] <%sumrand0> oh OLDDDDD hitman 1 yeah that's a relic of its time now haha
[4:30:01] <%asgard147> Witcher1 kinda jank? limesThink
[4:30:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Silent assassin was still kinda jank
[4:30:21] <dinnydanny777> but I like eurojank
[4:30:22] <T_Sasquatch> I remember being scared of hitman games LUL like it was horror
[4:30:23] <%Valdorick> Hitman 1 was concept, Hitman 2 was polish, Bloodmoney is perfection of the craft
[4:30:29] <%Valdorick> ... and Absolution Absolutely sucks
[4:30:34] <%MisterRockett> That sounds rad, tbh.
[4:30:36] <%sumrand0> blood money could get a remaster and still hold up with just a visual polish
[4:30:39] <+emperri> in XI they never added necromancer because undead come out at night. there was a necromancer NPC but they just refused due to worldbuilding
[4:30:40] <%Monkeyweed21> and they removed that map in Absolution cuz Absolution sucks ass
[4:30:57] <Zebroneath> Doing 100% for every level is NOT neccessary
[4:30:57] <heartlesshealer> I'd rather have Hitman Vision than rapdily bringing up a screenblocking map in a game like Hitman
[4:30:58] <+Alopekis> @Valdorick I had fun with Absolution, but it definitely wasn't a good Hitman game.
[4:31:08] <+emperri> rather, because they only come out at night
[4:31:17] <%Monkeyweed21> There are more missions in Sapienza with different targets and opportunities
[4:31:37] <T_Sasquatch> I liked Absolution but it was the first hitman game i beat
[4:31:52] <%AzureGale> They never do
[4:32:00] <mortificent> brownS brownS brownS
[4:32:00] <T_Sasquatch> Wow
[4:32:02] <%BoxNavy> :)
[4:32:04] <%baka_sugoi> WOOF
[4:32:05] <FatherGreyBeard> !uptime
[4:32:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 32m.
[4:32:07] <heartlesshealer> Retail and high school nightmares are ETERNAL
[4:32:08] <Zeikier> your FOOD EXAMS
[4:32:11] <%vexion_smh> THE PTSD
[4:32:15] <%whyskeywolfe> The best bit is when you wake up and realize its behind you.
[4:32:17] <%ItsAbout9000> ah fuck
[4:32:20] <@SoFarFetched> The problem is when you go to stores,you will see employees being treated like shit by customers and it WILL give you flashbacks.
[4:32:24] <Zeikier> capitalism is a fuck
[4:32:26] <heartlesshealer> They never go away for real, sorry guy
[4:32:28] <dinnydanny777> retail store trauma NotLikeThis
[4:32:29] <%twoto858> You're gonna carry that weight
[4:32:32] <%asgard147> They never go away, trust me, they will NEVER stop limesFeels
[4:32:35] <+Alopekis> I haven't had nightmares, but I actually do get some weird anxiety when I even think about my previous job. It was just a fast food job but I guess the stress with it at the time like permanently fucked up my brain.
[4:32:38] <%sumrand0> Confirmed I still wake up occasionally thinking I'm late to open the meat department
[4:32:40] <%AzureGale> Why would necromancers heal
[4:32:44] <Zeikier> give us Burmecians dammit! DansGame
[4:32:51] <+emperri> calculator
[4:32:52] <%logoth_> Does FF14 have calculators??
[4:32:54] <%BigCoffee> quemist is in older FF and is a skill in everyone
[4:32:55] <Midnight188> what classes from ff11 are we missing?!
[4:33:06] <%Broand> Alchemist?
[4:33:16] <+emperri> there's not paladins in tactics?
[4:33:26] <mortificent> Monk-e
[4:33:28] <heartlesshealer> Oracle is a sidequest?
[4:33:31] <+mikesapartment> not anymore they dont
[4:33:36] <Dr_Servbot> !uptime
[4:33:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 33m.
[4:33:43] <Zeikier> Geomancers are so fun in FFT
[4:33:44] <%AgniBrandt> There are DEFINITELY paladins in Tactics Advance
[4:33:48] <%AgniBrandt> No idea about original
[4:33:48] <theanora1> Did you see the new BLU skills?
[4:33:52] <%BoxNavy> math monkaS
[4:33:52] <+TheMorilo> Ninja is a streamer
[4:33:53] <+MugenSandan> Alphinaud has aspects of Orator
[4:33:55] <%Monkeyweed21> scholar
[4:34:01] <+MugenSandan> and Calculator
[4:34:03] <%Huntercd> nerds
[4:34:06] <@SoFarFetched> Give us Mimes from Tactics
[4:34:09] <%BigCoffee> Pat, think of FF5. The classes are all from there too
[4:34:10] <%BoxNavy> i would like to see onion knight
[4:34:22] <dinnydanny777> being an onion Knight should make you short
[4:34:23] <%logoth_> What about Knight blade
[4:34:30] <Zeikier> Gunbreaker is Cloud's FFT Job 4Head
[4:34:38] <heartlesshealer> Mime would take a LOT of planning around interactions I would think
[4:34:42] <SomersaultJustice> knight knight
[4:34:44] <+emperri> XI had rune fencers as a tank
[4:35:00] <T_Sasquatch> Ff tactics sounds SICK
[4:35:07] <@SoFarFetched> Give us Mascots from FFX-2 Kappa
[4:35:16] <Zeikier> FF TacSICKS
[4:35:17] <%Reaped_Psyche> Tactics was the best FF.
[4:35:24] <%AzureGale> A chemist could deal dope, crack, weed...
[4:35:27] <+MugenSandan> I remember there being a really good idea, look at Alphinaud and Alisae. they talk about getting new jobs at the end of 5.3
[4:35:28] <Zeikier> Necromancer petplay, got it
[4:35:29] <%Valdorick> The perpatch is everyone dying
[4:35:30] <%BoxNavy> pets suck
[4:35:30] <+vaderxyz1970> Necromancer is just preventative healing
[4:35:31] <Midnight188> Chemist, Beastmaster, Corsair, Geomancer, Puppetmaster, Rune Fencer....
[4:35:37] <%Valdorick> and then Necromancers heal your corpses
[4:35:43] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:35:48] <primarch_lupercal> ahaha gw2 has a healer necromancer
[4:35:48] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months!

[4:35:54] <heartlesshealer> wait wait, they removed the summon from Scholar? Am I hearing right???
[4:35:54] <+vaderxyz1970> Postventative healing
[4:35:57] <%twoto858> Plus fits with Garlemald, if that's the new area
[4:35:57] <%whyskeywolfe> Lanipator, maybe?
[4:35:57] <T_Sasquatch> Nice yes

[4:36:21] <%Valdorick> If you get really deep in there, a Necromancer could heal a living person by "stopping the decay of skin cells"
[4:36:23] <%asgard147> FUCK YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME
