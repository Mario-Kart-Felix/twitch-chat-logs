[0:12:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> servers, depending on location, get paid 2.25 an hour. Most restaurants also have the servers tip out the hosts if there are any, so yeah, it's a good idea to tip 20% at least.

[1:08:30] <juncopartner> @Mr_Initials Up till very recently I smoked a lot of weed. I hadn't really dreamed in years. I'm enjoying the return of super vivid dreams so far. I had a pretty intense "Juncopartner foils an alien invasion" one lately. Beaming on to the bridge, destroying the control consoles, Everything had textures and was real fleshed out an ex turned out to be the alien overlord. A white knuckle ride. A combination of weed leaving my system as well as the supplement.
[1:08:34] <ricksaintriot> maybe there's some environmental stuff
[1:08:34] <+aslfrasle> While you were doing combat challenges, I studied the Sider Man.

[1:15:43] <Rngiddion> that would make the stream background really morbid
[1:15:44] <%deviljhojho94> HACKERMAN
[1:15:46] <radical_skeleton> make elmo a drone and give him a gun
[1:15:46] <juncopartner> It's amazing that in a universe where people know that Spiderman exists that checking the exterior walls wouldn't immediately be added to security patrols
[1:15:50] <twitcherview1> foot stool
[1:15:50] <+Bupkis7> put the bulb in his ass
[1:15:50] <+MegaOrangutan> Drone-mo

[1:15:59] <Tisaric> their security is tough shit
[1:16:01] <Dragon_Batman> Get paid the big bucks
[1:16:05] <%deviljhojho94> Fuck off mj
[1:16:05] <ricksaintriot> they're really on top of this shit
[1:16:07] <element_of_loyalty> MJ looks terrible
[1:16:09] <$magikestral> you are trying to sneak into the mayor's office
[1:16:13] <%PipIV> they're really earning their paychecks
[1:16:19] <+SparkAfterDark> Why would they think it's anyone but spiderman? Like it's some other dude walking up a sheer wall 80 stories up
[1:16:20] <%kimo313> Paige looks kinda like MJ
[1:16:22] <%badchoice5> This game really plays up the whole "Peter Parker is a super-genius" thing
[1:16:26] <+imextremelymanly> you did it big good
[1:16:27] <Coystick> NEON
[1:16:28] <TheFilth> don't look near the neon sign
[1:16:28] <+TRYH4RDBL4CKGUY> MJ looks fine in this game
[1:16:30] <echodrone81> helicopter uses FLIR, sees spiderman immediately
[1:16:31] <thelonechris> They can't see him on that bright purple sign?
[1:16:34] <ricksaintriot> peter parker IS kind of a super-genius
[1:16:34] <$Mendin> Comfortably and disconcertingly competant
[1:16:34] <zal_silverfang> remember Spider man is doing this to REDUCE security to get in
[1:16:37] <+FadingEmber> Yuir is better that MJ I don't even care!
[1:16:39] <element_of_loyalty> MJ is bloated
[1:16:40] <HoIlywood_SN> M O R B I U S
[1:16:43] <ToneBacas> here follow the path in this open-world game LUL nah fuck it
[1:16:46] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Noooo
[1:16:46] <+SolidusRex> Peter/Yuri>>>>>Peter/MJ
[1:16:48] <%king_jaxon> Morgan Michaels is not Morbius.
[1:16:48] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Well I saw some of the origional avengers. And i wanted movies to reflect the comics cause I really liked the civil war comics. Now most ppl know the movie story so just kinda stinks for me. I was happy Strange got his own movie though. Really wish Marvel and DC both focused more on lesser known gems
[1:16:49] <%ToxInjection> Honestly don't understand some of the hate this MJ's been getting. I think she's great.
[1:16:50] <+fFailureatlife> morgan michales is that vampire
[1:16:55] <%matrixManipulator> Dedsec
[1:17:03] <HoIlywood_SN> @ToxInjection because she's just lois lane
[1:17:06] <gyrogogozeppeli> Kratos about to go after Spidey now
[1:17:07] <+mechslayer71> It’s not the best one tho
[1:17:08] <thelonechris> People like Spiderman
[1:17:08] <ricksaintriot> people hunger for the spider
[1:17:09] <vivecdidnothingwrong> LIVING CAMPIRE
[1:17:10] <Tisaric> it's spiderman
[1:17:10] <ToneBacas> 3.3M in 3 days
[1:17:14] <%gunslinger_xxiv> JJJ > Yuri > MJ

[1:17:25] <%rdark_ksu> man the sequels squeal is assured at this point
[1:17:25] <+oOZtkOo> awww i love mj
[1:17:25] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ToxInjection peeps have been used to the party girl MJ rather than the homely one
[1:17:26] <EMP_Ike_Turner> NIOH
[1:17:28] <Coystick> 30 billion coppies on day 0
[1:17:30] <%badchoice5> Good thing they held back Venom for the sequel
[1:17:31] <%sayaman012341> Not here to fuck spoiders moite
[1:17:32] <flame_of_udun_> Spider-Man sells. Period.
[1:17:37] <gyrogogozeppeli> Theyre stealing the Koei Tecmo statue
[1:17:38] <+FadingEmber> I'm not saying MJ is bad. I'm saying Yuri is better.
[1:17:40] <TheFilth> "who's talking in my vents?"
[1:17:42] <%ToxInjection> @HoIlywood_SN I understand that aspect. I guess I just appreciate Insomniac doing something different with her. Different within universe at least.
[1:17:48] <%kimo313> Osborn is an asshole
[1:17:49] <$MightyMaxT> I disliked her in the beginning but her full character arc made me love her again
[1:17:56] <DownPlayTwitch> Actually it sold .2 million more than God of War in the same period. So not like a huge blowout or something.
[1:17:58] <+imextremelymanly> Big plan on crappy powerpoint

[1:18:05] <+Sadira_snack_attack> but EA told me that I don't want single player games....why aren't all the suits hidden behind pay walls? That would be more rewarding

[1:18:22] <HoIlywood_SN> @ToxInjection something they could have done that would have been in the same spirit as this but also be different from every other Spider-Man adaptation is use Betty Brant
[1:18:23] <$Mendin> Cure any genetic disease... OR TURN PEOPLE INTO DINOSAURS?
[1:18:23] <vivecdidnothingwrong> THE BAD
[1:18:24] <%deviljhojho94> ph
[1:18:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I hope with the DLC they add in all the movie suits
[1:18:26] <%ToxInjection> @ThatGuyfromMars people always want creators to try different shit and then get mad because THIS IS NAHT WHAT I AM USED TO

[1:19:35] <%deviljhojho94> YEAH
[1:19:37] <Dragon_Batman> Flawless plan
[1:19:38] <+Sadira_snack_attack> Oscorp = EA
[1:19:38] <+imextremelymanly> I don't see the problem
[1:19:39] <%ToxInjection> NAH THE SAFE IS SUPER SECURE
[1:19:40] <element_of_loyalty> 2
[1:19:40] <VentusHero> whoever said that JJJ was better than yuri and MJ knows their shit
[1:19:41] <bearwagon> Osborne is a fucking dumbass
[1:19:41] <%deviljhojho94> No
[1:19:42] <+CammyEXE> Why not just store it in a underground facility or something
[1:19:42] <gyrogogozeppeli> Oscorp is basically Umbrella
[1:19:43] <mtgtin> ITS FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE
[1:19:43] <$MightyMaxT> IT"S FIIIIIIIIIIINE
[1:19:43] <%ToxInjection> SHUT UP
[1:19:44] <%rdark_ksu> or maybe just launch that shit into space! or toss in a volcano
[1:19:44] <Rngiddion> Black Cat tho
[1:19:44] <pede2011> NAH COMICBOOKS THO
[1:19:45] <+libra_zero> Don't they have the FORMULA?!?!?!?!?! @AngriestPat
[1:19:46] <ricksaintriot> just fucking destroy it
[1:19:49] <+oOZtkOo> you can put a man in a safe
[1:19:49] <zal_silverfang> Space Lab
[1:19:50] <%ToxInjection> NO SHUT UP IT'S SUPER SAFE
[1:19:50] <dekkitout> a safe 4 km underground
[1:19:51] <ricksaintriot> JUST DESTROY IT
[1:19:52] <gyrogogozeppeli> Oscorp is just Umbrella
[1:19:54] <%badchoice5> Safes don't work in a world of Super-villains
[1:19:55] <CatmanIX> why have a sample at all? if you have the recipe, you don't need a fucking sample
[1:19:56] <%rdark_ksu> Thas a McGuffin right there it is
[1:19:56] <viewtifulr> i mean you just broke in there pat
[1:19:57] <laguerrilha> Nah Black Cat would steal it
[1:20:01] <DXLelouch24> yea stopping
[1:20:01] <Innocuous_Goat> Drop that shit in a some cement and let it dry
[1:20:04] <DXLelouch24> ahahahahahahaha
[1:20:06] <Monsterman42O> @AngriestPat This is a world where Black Cat exists. You think a safe is secure when people like her are around?
[1:20:07] <flame_of_udun_> OSCORP DOESNT MAKE BAD DECISIONS
[1:20:08] <Limes528> It's Marvel. You think safes are actually "safe"?
[1:20:08] <Tisaric> not with supervillians around
[1:20:08] <TheFilth> Just put the fucking sample in a satellite
[1:20:08] <$magikestral> they need him to work on it a lot, locking it up would probably stop that @angriestpat
[1:20:09] <rytisone> Complete Global Masturbation
[1:20:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> NEW SUIT
[1:20:09] <element_of_loyalty> MJ is a BBW
[1:20:09] <%DaMexSupaMario> all it needs is a foreword from reggie fils and that presentation is the best
[1:20:10] <LeeOhX> yeah he'll stop it
[1:20:15] <tmo200> Nah its cuz Osborne is dumb and paramoid
[1:20:15] <ricksaintriot> i understand a safe wouldn't help, but just destroy it!!
[1:20:20] <Jaxnos> eeeeeeeh, in a world of superpowered villains and regular villains that break into banks every day, it's reasonable
[1:20:20] <studleydoorite> the PP presentation is more egregious
[1:20:21] <JDebss> or if it has to be kept on him, put HIM in a safe!
[1:20:23] <ricksaintriot> just destroy the thing
[1:20:25] <b1gboss007> Mj Is so stupid
[1:20:29] <Dragon_Batman> To be fair if someone goes dark with it in hand it might work better
[1:20:29] <ricksaintriot> destroy the sample, it's not hard.
[1:20:32] <%ToxInjection> OH TIME FOR SOME SHIT
[1:20:34] <%badchoice5> This is a world where people can warp space and time, what safe is gonna work?

[1:20:42] <Limes528> @ricksaintriot They wanns keep developing it. Too much money
[1:20:43] <gyrogogozeppeli> NTR
[1:20:46] <echodrone81> a safe in a lab with 24/7 security with a microwave purge
[1:20:47] <Jaxnos> can't destroy the sample because they want the sample doe

[1:36:44] <+FadingEmber> I want to point out that Peter is super right here and MJ being upset doesn't make any sense as she was stuck on a military base with no way to get out and a man pointing a gun at her!
[1:36:44] <sleepycorpse> Man MJ you are terrible
[1:36:45] <+smargh1015> yosuke and rise have a fight

[1:36:49] <JohnAtDawn> AND NOW SHE'S LYING
[1:36:50] <+libra_zero> "WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME GET EXECUTED BY PMCs, PETER" @AngriestPat
[1:36:50] <thelonechris> Dr. Strange is just sitting on the other side of that window
[1:36:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> BITCH YOU WERE IN A MILITARY BASE

[1:36:53] <+Sadira_snack_attack> MJ is terrible in this game
[1:36:53] <%deviljhojho94> this mj is bad
[1:36:53] <JDebss> She's not worth it
[1:36:54] <element_of_loyalty> TIGER
[1:36:55] <gyrogogozeppeli> Tiger
[1:37:00] <flame_of_udun_> Nobody can get MJ right NotLikeThis
[1:37:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> El Tigre
[1:37:03] <DanteDaFinest> Calls him whipped
[1:37:03] <%rdark_ksu> she calls him tiger once or twice

[1:37:05] <+imextremelymanly> tiger tiger tiger
[1:37:06] <EBT93> WHY DOESN’T SHE JUST TELL PETER ABOUT THIS SHIT?
[1:37:07] <%deviljhojho94> bitch black cat better be godlike
[1:37:07] <$MightyMaxT> Tiger Uppercut!
[1:37:08] <juncopartner> Peter literally has invisibility tech that he could have given her.
[1:37:08] <%ToxInjection> She calls him that twice I think.
[1:37:12] <+G_Thunders> MJ gets better as the game goes on, to be fair
[1:37:13] <feralady> TIGER PAT
[1:37:13] <VentusHero> its better than "jackpot"
[1:37:13] <Warbot40> LOOK ELSE WHERE PETER
[1:37:14] <ronyncato87> She's cuter than other iterations, but more annoying
[1:37:14] <element_of_loyalty> peach has no sexy talk

[1:37:27] <%Farples> YOU KEEP TREATING ME LIKE A BABY, YOU WON'T LET ME ALMOST GET KILLED AND SNEAK INTO BASES OF SUPER VILLANS
[1:37:27] <Coystick> She meant SPIDER but she bumbled and said TIGER
[1:37:28] <%badchoice5> Is MJ supposed to be strong and self-confident, or are we supposed to hate her?
[1:37:29] <ricksaintriot> I RAN A FACIAL RECOGNITION SEARCH
[1:37:30] <HoIlywood_SN> yeah text spider-man
[1:37:30] <wunderkonig> In this universe has Peter already lost a girlfriend by failing to save her after she was kidnapped while helping him?
[1:37:31] <AtlasMcCoy> Wait what
[1:37:31] <element_of_loyalty> PF CHANG
[1:37:32] <%CerberusDriver> She deliberately doesnt tell Peter about Grand Central because shes mad. Shes willing to risk New York because shes butthurt
[1:37:32] <+99STROWNS77> Pat is gonna SUCK at these
[1:37:32] <%PipIV> face it, poodle. you hit the jackpot!
[1:37:34] <AncelDeLambert> this one ain't hot enough to call ANYONE tiger
[1:37:34] <%CerberusDriver> MJ is the worst
[1:37:35] <arkv01> wait what facial recognition on facebook? thats fucked up man
[1:37:35] <outis94> what if she said it in the rise voice?
[1:37:37] <+Manooz> wait he TEXTTED SPIDER-MAN?
[1:37:38] <laguerrilha> You got Changed
[1:37:38] <flame_of_udun_> She gets better yeah, but she’s SUPER annoying now
[1:37:39] <+Bupkis7> Does everyone just have Spider-Man's number?
[1:37:40] <Coystick> ENHANCE
[1:37:40] <+imextremelymanly> scavenger hunt is a go

[1:37:45] <bunbundabuni> peepee paige n poodle -3pp's
[1:37:46] <Chainshada> My friend is missing, he posted this photo of him smiling 30mins ago
[1:37:46] <Limes528> MJ is rarely good. I don't think this one is awful, but this is definitely the low-point of her arc
[1:37:47] <XdaXcaptainX> SHE THINKS SHES FRANK FUCKIN WEST
[1:37:52] <wunderkonig> In other words has Gwen Already Died in this universe giving Peter even more of a reason to do that.
[1:37:53] <%Keyd00d> he has spidey's number
[1:37:55] <%SuperCasualBoom> Philip Chang aka the owner of PF Chang
[1:37:56] <ricksaintriot> yeah where's the Gwen Staci subplot
[1:37:57] <Coystick> BUT IT'S DAYLIGHT
[1:37:58] <Theworld732> I thought he was gonna say Amadeus cho
[1:38:00] <Poobumbutt> "Tiger" would sound unnatural Says person who's been watching for a total of 2 hours?
[1:38:02] <%ToxInjection> HALF AN HOUR AGO
[1:38:02] <+Manooz> Does EVERYONE JUST HAVE SPIDEY-MAN'S NUMBER?
[1:38:05] <%ToxInjection> IT'S DAYLIGHT
[1:38:05] <element_of_loyalty> EH HEH
[1:38:07] <+Sadira_snack_attack> seriously...does everyone have his number?
[1:38:10] <Dragon_Batman> Probably
[1:38:11] <$ooblagis> MJ is supposed to be a STRONG INDEPENDANT WOMAN, except they made her a shrill loser who's only characterization is in regard to her relationship with a man
[1:38:12] <+fFailureatlife> gwen doesnt exist in this universe
[1:38:13] <ricksaintriot> Gwen Stefaci
[1:38:16] <+imextremelymanly> yeah you helped a superhero
[1:38:23] <%PipIV> @xdaxcaptainx she HASN'T covered wars y'know?"
[1:38:23] <%badchoice5> Same reason Santa as a reference isn't great

[1:38:42] <+zeiss_schreiber> Don't think about it
[1:38:43] <XdaXcaptainX> she could at least be not retarded
[1:38:43] <Limes528> Side Quest shenanigans
[1:38:44] <laguerrilha> shhhh its fine
[1:38:44] <%ECRead> because shuttup
[1:38:44] <%deviljhojho94> she is just a giant flaw LUL

[1:38:48] <@SSaryn> Because shut up
[1:38:48] <+ChrisAlgoo> dang some of yall are real mad about MJ
[1:38:52] <%Freelance7> This mission is given in the day time
[1:38:53] <Coystick> UNPLAYABLE
[1:38:54] <Dragon_Batman> Funny it doesn't time jump for this one
[1:38:58] <pillowwasp> Nuclear explosion
[1:39:01] <%BoboDaHobo> because you played a different story mission 30 minutes ago I guess
[1:39:03] <rytisone> ITS A TRAP
[1:39:04] <+SomeSortOfMagic> @AngriestPat take a picture of statue of liberty
[1:39:04] <TheFilth> get these women out of my Spider-man's
[1:39:04] <+imextremelymanly> is fine i dont anything about Quebec
[1:39:05] <Raccoonial> God screwed up, don't even imply that Insomniac Games makes mistakes you LIAR
[1:39:06] <$MightyMaxT> It'll show up on the map
[1:39:06] <%Keeble24> JJ jameson is the true hero NY deserves
[1:39:06] <element_of_loyalty> HIJACK A HELICOPTER
[1:39:07] <eggs_in_bed> @ricksaintriot I don't get the hate either, her character in a video game based on a comic series with alternate universes is head strong and it makes her do dumb shit sometimes even though she actually doesn't screw up. The writers are allowed to have their take and it's not like it's inconsistent or absurd considering the source material.
[1:39:07] <ricksaintriot> idk about anyone else, but i don't hate MJ
[1:39:07] <flame_of_udun_> @chrisalgoo Her argument makes no sense
[1:39:10] <ricksaintriot> i just like to complain
[1:39:10] <%Rostichenburg> This one took me ages to find
[1:39:11] <%CerberusDriver> @fFailureatlife she doesnt tell Peter about Grand Central because shes mad, shes risking innocent lives because shes butthurt, shes pretty bad dude
[1:39:13] <%PipIV> @ffailureatlife yeah, but actively putting herself in danger doesn't help either
[1:39:15] <+imextremelymanly> you close
[1:39:17] <XdaXcaptainX> maybe we arent really that mad and we just have fun complaining
[1:39:17] <%Kage_96> Dont worry its very obvious
[1:39:18] <wunderkonig> Theoretically the main bad thing that happens in this game is all MJ's fault.

[1:39:33] <%Keyd00d> the hipster crane party
[1:39:34] <%GallopingWalrus> Its literally right in front of him.
[1:39:36] <juncopartner> Miles sneaking past the demons when his dad was murdered was arguably way more stupid and infuriating than MJ's actions
[1:39:38] <element_of_loyalty> PEACH HONK PAT

[1:40:42] <+mimikyu92> To be fair, MJ handled that perfectly up until bumble king spidey came in

[1:40:51] <+fFailureatlife> if its dumb but it works its not dumb
[1:40:52] <Dragon_Batman> There is a compass above your mini map

[1:41:10] <+smargh1015> And puzzles
[1:41:10] <gomennasorry> piage get the horn

[1:43:19] <EMP_Ike_Turner> LEAVE THEM TO ROAST
[1:43:19] <Poobumbutt> @Hollywood_SN But she does it. Like real good. In a later mission, she's even MORE useful. So are normal people not allowed to be useful because theyre "squishy"?

[1:43:54] <%Keeble24> the internet has the most christian family friendly community like 4chan
[1:43:54] <%Jpdodds> @mimikyu9 She infiltrated a paramilitary base, and when Peter (who has presumably already lost Gwen at this point) saw her held at gunpoint, he entered the room, at which point Standish knocked HIMSELF OUT. It took peter literal seconds to easily reach the same building that MJ had to evade mercenaries to enter. MJ going to Sable was stupid
[1:43:55] <conflict1914> ITS THERE

[1:44:33] <%ToxInjection> @Jpdodds to be fair, we don't know if Gwen exists in this universe
[1:44:41] <%Rostichenburg> Considering there's no Green Goblin nor mention of Gwen I'd say she's fine or doesn't exist
[1:44:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @BopBeep funny that

[1:45:16] <ricksaintriot> @Innocuous_Goat half of them
[1:45:18] <%ToxInjection> I feel MJ mainly comes off as reckless because she just doesn't communicate with Peter enough and Peter really doesn't team up with her as much as he should till later.
[1:45:18] <%badchoice5> I UNDERSTOOD THAT REFERENCE
[1:45:19] <legoaisu> did he reallly just make a fps game ref?

[1:45:46] <Poobumbutt> @wunderkonig First part: yeah, its like she wants to be... useful or something and not feel inadequate. Weird. Second: the gear is inarguable. That's super weird. Although I know the logical reason is "because game"
[1:45:48] <%ToxInjection> get fucking good

[1:47:14] <wunderkonig> @Poobumbutt SHe's an investigative reporter she would make a great Oracle type instead of trying to sneak into places and be vulnerable, hell she'd even make a better lookout who could spot people and oncomming enemies from a rooftop.
[1:47:15] <%Keeble24> yeah, that guy is totally dead
[1:47:15] <EMP_Ike_Turner> never been more dead
[1:47:16] <%badchoice5> Good thing Spiderman used his tazer-feet to stomp his head into the tazer-concrete
[1:47:16] <$magicalhades> styled on
[1:47:16] <Poobumbutt> @juncopartner this is also a good point. Being willing to be in danger for "a story" is nearly required for reporters
[1:47:17] <+fFailureatlife> MJ is based on the ultimate universe version
[1:47:19] <element_of_loyalty> DO IT
[1:47:20] <%violetheart> Yeyeye this mission
[1:47:22] <laguerrilha> this part is hard
[1:47:22] <echodrone81> 200 pound dude dropping on you at like 70 mph. you fucking dead 😲
[1:47:22] <ricksaintriot> she's asleep
[1:47:22] <%ToxInjection> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap Peter bumbleking'd himself with MJ at the Sable outpost, and Pat beat up a bunch of college kids
[1:47:23] <%GallopingWalrus> He didn't fall, but the blunt force trauma definitely offed him.
[1:47:24] <%violetheart> hope you're good at stealth, Pat.
[1:47:27] <jack_s1n> peach is dead
[1:47:28] <%Keeble24> KILL THEM ALL PETER
[1:47:29] <thehornypastrypuffer> but you are killing people right now peter
[1:47:35] <%Rostichenburg> I was trying to figure out how Pat had so many more skills than me at this point in the game then I remembered he got those five free points for preorder
[1:47:43] <+imextremelymanly> remember pat swing closer to the ground to swing faster
[1:47:43] <Tisaric> He's perfect
[1:47:45] <%deviljhojho94> yuri is good
[1:47:47] <wunderkonig> @Poobumbutt there's a part later in the game where she basically does that and it works great, but if she goes off into danger alone that's just less efficient
[1:47:47] <element_of_loyalty> CLINTON CASTLE
[1:47:48] <Limes528> He only gets better
[1:47:49] <%ToxInjection> Yuri's phenomenal in the game, honestly
[1:47:51] <Coystick> Yeah Yuri is 10/10
[1:47:52] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @toxinjection have we found Morgan Michaels yet?
[1:47:54] <ricksaintriot> how did they set this up

[1:49:29] <HoIlywood_SN> i personally think if they wanted a female love interest reporter for Spider-Man, they shouldnt have completely changed Mary Jane as a character into something that realy just isnt Mary Jane, and instead used the existing Daily Bugle character who was Peters first love interest, Betty Brant. Traditionally she's a secretary but it'd still be more in line with that characters background without having to make such a shift in role and personality

[2:05:50] <Sotetsu> She totally cracked it.
[2:05:53] <wunderkonig> They should have done a mission where you are forced to rescue JJJ, and then he says you kidnapped him on his podcast.
[2:05:54] <%PipIV> it's the natural evolution of J. Jonah Jameson Jr.

[2:15:01] <wunderkonig> cell shading games are also cheaper to make, but hopefully most developers won't figure out people like them, or else they'll flood the market with sub par ones.

[2:15:55] <%badchoice5> I DEMAND QUIPS
[2:15:57] <ricksaintriot> he looks like he's floating in front of the rest of the game
[2:15:58] <Coystick> SORTH WEAST
[2:15:58] <rytisone> This now looks like that 3D animated spiderman cartoon
[2:16:02] <XHeavyfireX> Don't wear this in cutscenes, you look garnish af
[2:16:11] <flame_of_udun_> There’s an even cooler one coming up
[2:16:12] <AncelDeLambert> this costume looks REALLY good
[2:16:13] <%Rostichenburg> I prefer the 2099 black suit to the white one
[2:16:17] <%ECRead> Spiderman is jerking off and his radioactive spider semen is turning the pigeons gay
[2:16:17] <DestroyerDJ8> i'd love a fully cel-shaded/comic book style spider-man game
[2:16:18] <pillowwasp> White one is better for story missions
[2:16:20] <+mimikyu92> so have they ever established what J Jonah Jameson's actual beef is? is he just a salty boi?
[2:16:22] <amavii> whens spider noir

[2:16:27] <HoIlywood_SN> @DestroyerDJ8 Ultimate Spider-Man
[2:16:28] <%badchoice5> This suit was clearly designed by someone who loves Spiderman
[2:16:29] <flame_of_udun_> @mimikyu92 the usual
[2:16:29] <juhbathehutt> stand
[2:16:31] <+The_Midnight_Pud_Monster> My favorite is Peter in his underroos

[2:16:31] <%PipIV> @mimikyu92 salty.
[2:16:32] <fmc009> Naruto Cell Shading Costume Kappa
[2:16:32] <gyrogogozeppeli> @mimikyu92 he hates masked men
[2:16:33] <Shinmaddrox> You will end the game with No Base/Backpack Tokens.
[2:16:33] <AncelDeLambert> We have reached the level of graphical finess that we can 3D model rotoscoping
[2:16:35] <Monsterman42O> @AngriestPat Can you use the quip ability while traversing? It's pretty cute. <3
[2:16:36] <JDebss> 2099 Blue and red is best
[2:16:39] <juncopartner> @Mornaka I'd heard about that alright. Doc Ock realises peters been pulling his punches all along or something. I mean when it's actually peter himself and just a street level criminal with no powers or suit. Be n intersting storyline if he was wracked with guilt
[2:16:39] <dekkitout> 1 hunnid!
[2:16:43] <%Rostichenburg> @DestroyerDJ8 Ultimate Spider-Man was that
[2:16:43] <god__of__lore> New bases incoming
[2:16:45] <DXLelouch24> no more bases till like the last act
[2:16:47] <+Tylermcd93> Holy shit that suit is awful
[2:16:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @mimikyu92 He is biased towards people with masks and doesn't trust anyone who has one
[2:16:51] <+ZimmiZ> @AngriestPat you have to do the extra challenges from the bases to get the extra tokens
[2:16:52] <ronyncato87> Last Stand is my go to. So salty it was toward the end
[2:16:53] <Coystick> I like the "final" BLACK AND YELLOW suit
[2:16:53] <+Meekest> This is the best costume
[2:16:56] <%Beough> is it just me or does it look like his model is running at a higher frame rate?
[2:16:57] <+imextremelymanly> dlc new suit I need bag man

[2:17:07] <%PipIV> it's like in spider-man 2 when J.k. Simmons wore the spidey suit
[2:17:08] <+fFailureatlife> @Tylermcd93 what's it like being wrong?
[2:17:08] <+smargh1015> Last Stand is really cool

[2:17:11] <ricksaintriot> what happens if peter parker gets a charlie horse midair
[2:17:19] <flame_of_udun_> @tylermcd93 oof bad take
[2:17:19] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Guys, Paige....might be a bad influence on me; I got 3 McD sandwiches sitting in front of me right now....
[2:17:21] <HoIlywood_SN> apparently each of the DLCs is coming with 3 new suits and iirc the first 3 are the raimi movie costumes
[2:17:26] <ricksaintriot> does spider blood prevent muscle tearing?
[2:17:28] <DestroyerDJ8> @Rostichenburg and it was pretty good, but a new one in this vein would be pretty nice. maybe even both playable characters again
[2:17:33] <+Tylermcd93> @fFailureatlife I wouldn't know
[2:17:37] <TafferAA> kill all college students
[2:17:39] <HoIlywood_SN> as in human spider, raimi red, raimi black
[2:17:41] <element_of_loyalty> THEY HATE THAT TRUCK
[2:17:41] <dekkitout> or the *mild healing factor
[2:17:41] <%PipIV> @dirtydeedsdundirtcheap don't do it. we love you.
[2:17:41] <+fFailureatlife> D:

[2:23:19] <+smargh1015> @mendin which is weird Because some spiders are pretty hairy
[2:23:19] <gyrogogozeppeli> this is what Ultimate Spiderman looked like
[2:23:20] <Rngiddion> They would have to redo the entire city
[2:23:23] <Parapattern> The realistic, uncanny valley look of this game is what turned me off of it.
[2:23:23] <Coystick> Push for a filter on TWITTER
[2:23:28] <XdaXcaptainX> FUCK YEAH CELL SHADED SPIDER GAME
[2:23:28] <flame_of_udun_> ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN 2.0

[2:23:29] <%ToxInjection> SHE LOOKS FINE STOP BEING MEAN BibleThump
[2:23:30] <+mimikyu92> keep the art style consistent. maybe another spidey franchise
[2:23:31] <Shinmaddrox> Or at least made it so it had mode you could unlock to change the entire games look to that.
[2:23:33] <+imextremelymanly> i think the latest uncharted had something like that
[2:23:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Realism sucks, people Dab in reality
[2:23:36] <$Mendin> @smargh1015 we don't talk about Man-Spider
[2:23:36] <dekkitout> LUL

[2:23:40] <%PipIV> oof
[2:23:42] <vivecdidnothingwrong> ppf
[2:23:45] <DXLelouch24> Pat the sequel will obviously be VENOM
[2:23:47] <Freedom_EX> it would look like Ultimate Spiderman
[2:23:47] <vivecdidnothingwrong> no no no
[2:23:48] <DXLelouch24> so NO
[2:23:48] <flame_of_udun_> OOF
[2:23:52] <+fFailureatlife> she looks fine you nerds
[2:23:53] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat play Ultimate Spider-Man, its a game that looks exactly like you're describing
[2:23:54] <%ToxInjection> I like her looking more girl-next-door and homebody instead of regular supermodel MJ
[2:23:56] <TheFilth> I'd cream
[2:23:57] <$Mornaka> i would shit my pants\
[2:23:57] <%Rostichenburg> It'd feel really weird to have a direct sequel in a completely different art style
[2:23:58] <pakuman> It'd be horiffic
[2:24:00] <lloyddboy> oh snap
[2:24:00] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @angriestpat what about Uncharted-style screen filters?
[2:24:05] <lloyddboy> just like her neck
[2:24:05] <ronyncato87> Who are we talking about?
[2:24:06] <boldandsaucywrongs> I'd literally nut
[2:24:06] <$DavidCrimsonHeidern> whoa page nip slip
[2:24:06] <JDebss> I hope they have a 60s spiderman cartoon version
[2:24:08] <thelonechris> It would be trippy as hell
[2:24:08] <element_of_loyalty> elmo
[2:24:08] <conflict1914> my superpower is FASHION
[2:24:09] <pakuman> *horrific
[2:24:10] <Limes528> Gwen Stacy is different in every iteration. She went from boring to goth chick to super hero
[2:24:11] <+smargh1015> @parapattern yeah some of the faces are a little weird, but the game is really great otherwise
[2:24:16] <+DeaconBluesClues> power over coloration would be super powerful and is one of my desired Stando Powers
[2:24:16] <Coystick> Benom
[2:24:19] <%Rostichenburg> I've seen cosplays look like this
[2:24:21] <Captain_Rotmeat> and green goblin
[2:24:22] <+shawntk_> But Venom wasn't in the Reimi movies until 3
[2:24:22] <wunderkonig> ....did you, did you literally leap out of a comic book spiderman? is that where your powers come from? are you actually 2d? turn sideways.
[2:24:24] <+mimikyu92> isn't that just Slapstick
[2:24:24] <EMP_Ike_Turner> what about TRAP ROOM
[2:24:27] <rytisone> or a 3rd movie
[2:24:29] <element_of_loyalty> SHOW US
[2:24:31] <Coystick> Venom is his Joker
[2:24:32] <DXLelouch24> we dont talk about 3
[2:24:32] <sparrrow_> what if Spiderman had natural web shooters but they came out of his ass like a real spider????
[2:24:33] <%badchoice5> Ominous music begin now
[2:24:33] <dekkitout> then the third one has carnage as a side quest SeriousSloth
[2:24:34] <%bloodypurpledog> Maybe even the new shiny red goblin
[2:24:34] <%PipIV> Ultimate Gwen Stacy was opinionated alt chick
[2:24:34] <dreu81> venom, then carnage, then phage Kappa
[2:24:34] <+redstonej> bring out anti-venom
[2:24:35] <XHeavyfireX> Get back in black Spidy
[2:24:35] <+in_spaaace> Venom is the spider-man version of Vergil if you think about it
[2:24:37] <cherubsanonymous> Or in this case ANTI-VENOM, cause y'know Mr Negative
[2:24:38] <DXLelouch24> NO
[2:24:39] <jacknerik> has he gone evil yet
[2:24:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Venom has a Movie coming out soon! There WILL be DLC with Venom in this game guaranteed
[2:24:41] <juncopartner> That would be a pretty good superpower. If your body existed with cartoon physics.
[2:24:44] <SecretFawf> What if Pete walked into Otto's lab and Peter was just a CARTOON.
[2:24:44] <DXLelouch24> GREEN GOBLIN IS HIS JOKER
[2:24:46] <lloyddboy> DO PUZZLE
[2:24:47] <+imextremelymanly> I hope its the funny venom
[2:24:51] <%Keeble24> anyone gonna give that venom movie a chance???
[2:24:57] <thelonechris> Hoo boy...
[2:24:58] <+jetrouverai> I hope they bring back symbiote doc ock
[2:24:59] <circular7> crazy talk?
[2:25:01] <Coystick> No way Green Gobbo is a chode

[2:27:16] <HoIlywood_SN> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap thats something i always liked about Doc Ock, his arms were initially for handling radioactive materials in his lab from a safe distance while watching through a special shield, but then it fucking exploded and melted into his spine
[2:27:17] <%ToxInjection> now do MORE nerd puzzle
[2:27:18] <+smargh1015> reminds me of mass effect music

[2:28:03] <Parapattern> Puzzles. And thinking. And think, think, think.
[2:28:08] <%Rostichenburg> It's really weird how much this game sets up Superior Spider-Man but it's co-written by Dan Slott so makes sense
[2:28:11] <%Keeble24> HACK THEM ALL PETER
[2:28:18] <Coystick> Oh go it is the Map theme...

[2:28:40] <wunderkonig> hmm....I hope for the sequel they don't kill off parker and make the entire thing about MIles instead of letting you play them both.
[2:28:41] <soutakuphi> @AngriestPat hey check his office and the white board when you got the time
[2:28:42] <element_of_loyalty> Complexed
[2:28:44] <dreu81> dont mess up peter and screw up otto's brain Kappa
[2:28:45] <%Keeble24> wow pat, good job apatWhat
[2:28:55] <%CerberusDriver> i hope theres a Superior SpiderMan suit in the dlc
[2:28:56] <%PipIV> @rostichenburg that explains MJ a bit
[2:28:59] <%badchoice5> Peter could have built the Doc Oc suit without his superpowers, Peter is OP
[2:28:59] <%CerberusDriver> that suit is great
[2:29:02] <+mimikyu92> @juncopartner he's a guy with Looney Tunes physics in the marvel universe. Taskmaster once tried to fight him and broke his own spine trying to replicate his bullshit
[2:29:09] <sparrrow_> man I wish MJ was hotter
[2:29:12] <%korth367> ???
[2:29:15] <+Tylermcd93> I hope Gwen is in the sequel
[2:29:15] <+imextremelymanly> have the thing connect to the thing
[2:29:16] <+fFailureatlife> @wunderkonig i kinda want to playas both
[2:29:17] <%Rostichenburg> I want a playable Spider-Girl but it'll never happen
[2:29:19] <therealtacopancakes> Yo pat, what yp with telltale
[2:29:20] <+fFailureatlife> gwen sucks
[2:29:21] <Parapattern> If Peter can make this stuff even better than Doc Oc, then why does he need him to make his gadgets for him?
[2:29:25] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @hoilywood_sn feels a bit weird hearing differences from that origin story from how he was in the Spider-Man 2 movie, which first introduced me to the character (I didn’t keep up with comics as a kid...)
[2:29:28] <%Afterman_> peter is legit one of the smartest characters in MCU
[2:29:31] <dekkitout> voltage go down
[2:29:31] <+imextremelymanly> you did it
[2:29:32] <flame_of_udun_> Actually Dan Scott has very little to do with this game, he was mostly just a consultant
[2:29:37] <%CerberusDriver> so apparently IGN did the dumb thing and their 15 minute Dante video had spoilers in it
[2:29:38] <flame_of_udun_> *Slott
[2:29:39] <+Tylermcd93> Gwen's awesome
[2:29:40] <element_of_loyalty> 2.8
[2:29:40] <lloyddboy> you...
[2:29:40] <grayjammer> DANG-UH, HIGH VOLTAGE
[2:29:43] <sparrrow_> Doc Squidman
[2:29:44] <%CerberusDriver> so they took it down
[2:29:47] <Limes528> Gwen was only good in Spider-Man: Blue
[2:29:51] <%Keeble24> Is Reed Richards the smartest still???
[2:29:55] <lloyddboy> did it
[2:29:56] <$magikestral> to be fair, he would have had someone else do it had you not
[2:29:57] <dekkitout> spider-gwen is cool, 616 gwen....meh...
[2:29:59] <TheFilth> oh IGN, never change
[2:30:00] <element_of_loyalty> TONY SOPRANO?
[2:30:01] <flame_of_udun_> @keeble24 yeah
[2:30:02] <HoIlywood_SN> @CerberusDriver naked trish ass
[2:30:05] <conflict1914> what about the famous spoderman villain: Nurse Squid
[2:30:08] <%CerberusDriver> yeah basically
[2:30:08] <EMP_Ike_Turner> maybe he won't be a big evil
[2:30:12] <sparrrow_> It's weird how Yuri has to call his own wife Yuri in this game
[2:30:15] <dekkitout> nice one peter
[2:30:16] <Mastigias> So what are the odds of this going to shit?
[2:30:17] <juncopartner> @mimikyu92 please tell me he pulls a roadrunner at least once and invents a train tunnel out of nowhere. I used to think I'd want invisibilty but I kind of want to be a toon instead

[2:32:34] <HoIlywood_SN> ALS

[2:32:54] <+BopBeep> No one knows
[2:32:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> AH IT'S SO HEART FELT
[2:32:55] <cherubsanonymous> Dan Slott has such a hard on for Doc Ock it's absurd

[2:33:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Setting up for Superior Spiderman lol
[2:33:05] <%Keeble24> Does this mean that Doc Oc has 8 dicks to use his arms for???
[2:33:07] <blackbookalpha> Doc Ball Fondle
[2:33:08] <%violetheart> It's really nice to have this connection to Doc Oc though. I feel like he doesn't get enough screen time despite being really neat.
[2:33:09] <%Afterman_> i feel for him
[2:33:09] <%badchoice5> Doc Oc + Venom can be a full game
[2:33:09] <Dragon_Batman> you have to venom to find that answer
[2:33:10] <+fFailureatlife> doc ock is the best

[2:34:34] <%Afterman_> dude is legit stephen hawking if he decided to make robo arms
[2:34:36] <+ziggityzaq> Patton had myth busters make him a doc ock suit for Halloween with his daughter as Spider-Man

[2:34:50] <+mimikyu92> just. become an octopous
[2:34:51] <%Picabunny> This Aunt May is WONDERFUL
[2:34:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Aunt MAY be a Milf
[2:34:54] <Coystick> 9-11 2

[2:34:59] <+imextremelymanly> nope
[2:35:00] <Oxybe> curse you terrorism!
[2:35:00] <ronyncato87> It's the Jim Carrey effect
[2:35:00] <element_of_loyalty> MIles Tails Prower?
[2:35:01] <powerprotoman> ever since pat let the terrorists win miles life has been rough
[2:35:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> YET
[2:35:03] <Shinmaddrox> @rytisone Look up Superior spider-man
[2:35:03] <cherubsanonymous> YET
[2:35:07] <sparrrow_> How did Miles get bitten in the comics
[2:35:09] <%PipIV> NO
[2:35:10] <+Bupkis7> I hope not
[2:35:11] <%ToxInjection> Wait, who voice acts Aunt May? Now I gotta check
[2:35:11] <XdaXcaptainX> pat thats dumb
[2:35:12] <%Afterman_> i mean if you think about it...those arms are 100000x better than human ones
[2:35:13] <AncelDeLambert> Why couldn't they make this the version where Octavius is dating May?
[2:35:14] <Prism_Wing> Looks like Archer Spiderman
[2:35:15] <%SaltyDongs> Where's gwen
[2:35:15] <element_of_loyalty> AUNT MAY WEARS A WIG?
[2:35:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Miles Manners
[2:35:18] <%deviljhojho94> Doubtful but maybe a second character
[2:35:18] <juncopartner> @mornaka the newest bojack season got real fucking dark. EVery year I wonder how they can even hope to go darker and they keep pulling it off
[2:35:18] <%ECRead> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO WUT
[2:35:19] <+Tokanova> thwip!
[2:35:19] <flame_of_udun_> They coexist in 616 now

[2:35:23] <EBT93> I love this upcoming scene
[2:35:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Shhhhh @AngriestPat
[2:35:24] <%Hispanacomida25> I legit love Miles
[2:35:27] <Parapattern> Peter, we need to run the telemetry data on my eight-pronged super dick!
[2:35:27] <%Afterman_> especially for a side character
[2:35:27] <Limes528> @AngriestPat I'd change the suit for cutscenes
[2:35:28] <%badchoice5> Noise canceling mask
[2:35:29] <mtgtin> They are both 616 now
[2:35:29] <+fFailureatlife> @AncelDeLambert DansGame
[2:35:30] <XdaXcaptainX> side spider. sider
[2:35:32] <%deviljhojho94> Insomniac is not dumb enough to replace peter with miles
[2:35:33] <wunderkonig> the idea of naming any alternate universe "superior" doesn't make me feel good.
[2:35:34] <%Afterman_> err for a scientist*
[2:35:34] <%korth367> phone is in his mask tho
[2:35:35] <%deviljhojho94> that would be dumb
[2:35:35] <%PipIV> @element_of_loyalty she dyes it
[2:35:37] <AtlasMcCoy> LUL
[2:35:39] <%Keeble24> Will Tony Stark be there totally hitting on aunt may???
[2:35:40] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> The Arkham series does the same thing, taking influences from multiple works in the Batman franchise.
[2:35:40] <circular7> miles becomes a villain?
[2:35:40] <SeventyForce> Is pat trolling naw....?
[2:35:41] <+smargh1015> Abe Lincoln defeated his Dad to win Civil War RAW
[2:35:41] <+imextremelymanly> not really
[2:35:45] <+VoidShaman> Too true.
[2:35:47] <+mimikyu92> no pat, that's DC comics!
[2:35:47] <element_of_loyalty> PEACH IS AUNT MAY COSPLAY
[2:35:47] <wunderkonig> don't forget the glasses are Hypno specs
[2:35:48] <flame_of_udun_> Replacing Peter would be suicide
[2:35:48] <Nova712> But that's a different universe Pat
[2:35:48] <%Agami23> miles being spiderman in the sequel AND having a venom theme would work really well together
[2:35:48] <Shinmaddrox> Surprised that The Superior Spider-man suit isn't in this.
[2:35:50] <%gunslinger_xxiv> ffft fft ffft fft ffft
[2:35:51] <%SmolBluGhost> the cab is magically a drop top
[2:35:52] <+Sadira_snack_attack> theres a projectile warning
[2:35:52] <%Freelance7> Good scene
[2:35:53] <+Tokanova> why is miles getting bullied
[2:35:54] <+fFailureatlife> GUYS THIS SCENE IS GOOD
[2:35:54] <%deviljhojho94> URBAN VIOLENCE
[2:35:55] <%badchoice5> Paige, Peter is a legit super-genius in this world
[2:35:55] <$magikestral> oooh, BEST cutscene
[2:35:56] <conflict1914> superman wears makeup confirmed
[2:35:57] <filialpails> comics work on polkaroo rules
[2:35:57] <dreu81> wait, paige is superman?
[2:35:57] <thewhiterice92> He does bullshit
[2:35:58] <AncelDeLambert> MayXOctavius is CANON
[2:35:58] <%SaltyDongs> NOT THAT DIFFERENT
[2:35:58] <%ToxInjection> Ooh this scene's GREAT
[2:36:01] <EBT93> HERE WE GO
[2:36:02] <Coystick> No one would guess you're really PEACH SALIVA
[2:36:02] <dekkitout> are we seeing a hate crime?
[2:36:03] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat If you see the actual comparison, they look like totally different people
[2:36:03] <%yet_another_brony> when i got glasses, no one recognized me. cowrkers called me clark kent
[2:36:03] <+Ssaik> this is real good one
[2:36:03] <joblessbone> MIGHT MAKES RIGHT
[2:36:04] <Dragon_Batman> @sparrrow_ his uncle stashed boxes from oscorp he stole and when miles finds it a spider was a part of it and bit him, i believe
[2:36:06] <+flame12> its been implied lex knows who supes is he just hates super man not clark
[2:36:07] <Snoopsis> Best scene here we go
[2:36:07] <+Extrallent> why does every thug wear a ski mask in this universe
[2:36:08] <%SaltyDongs> Kill em all
[2:36:08] <+Ciphris> what if miles is venom
[2:36:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> holy shit I didn't know ock in this game is Mordin
[2:36:09] <+Meekest> I think there's a lot of good explanations for Clark Kent and Superman
[2:36:09] <+heehofrosty> Microphones have noise cancelling
[2:36:09] <AtlasMcCoy> DEAD
[2:36:10] <dekkitout> KILL THEM ALL MILES
[2:36:10] <%PipIV> what a coincidence
[2:36:13] <element_of_loyalty> DEATH
[2:36:13] <alliedmastercompy> Peach with different makeup and hair looks like a completely different beautiful woman.
[2:36:13] <gyrogogozeppeli> Dead
[2:36:14] <+imextremelymanly> they dead
[2:36:15] <%deviljhojho94> LUL
[2:36:16] <+GingerTwerk213> Pat he puts up a huge act
[2:36:16] <%badchoice5> DEAD
[2:36:17] <yendoria> HE GOT SOME GOOD HITS IN THOUGH
[2:36:17] <laguerrilha> yeyeye
[2:36:17] <rytisone> Woolie during making of Aliens Collonial Marines video
[2:36:20] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Clark Kents disguise makes perfect sense because Superman to the public HAS a real name (kal-el) and a known home (the fotress)
[2:36:20] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Sweet AH sweater
[2:36:21] <+Tylermcd93> What kind of jacket was that guy wearing?
[2:36:21] <%badchoice5> Dead
[2:36:22] <extradopeness> THERE IT IS.
[2:36:23] <%violetheart> @sparrrow_ In the comics, Miles' uncle is a villain who steals a genetically altered spider that Oscorp made using Peter's DNA. The spider escapes and bites Miles, thus Spider Powers.
[2:36:24] <+Tokanova> they are all dying
[2:36:24] <TheFilth> oh this'll be great with this costume
[2:36:25] <%ToxInjection> This suit is gonna fucking RUIN some story cutscenes LUL
[2:36:26] <+mimikyu92> five guys in balaclavas, jesus
[2:36:27] <%SmolBluGhost> ew
[2:36:27] <pillowwasp> Look at this goofy shit
[2:36:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Saved by a cartoon
[2:36:28] <%deviljhojho94> FUCKING LUL
[2:36:30] <Parapattern> Be sure to do this in broad daylight
[2:36:30] <element_of_loyalty> MR J
[2:36:31] <Nova712> This costume makes the game feel like Who Framed Roger Rabbit...
[2:36:33] <cherubsanonymous> The whole Clark Kent thing is actually that everyone thinks Superman is just a public idenity and that they just look alike
[2:36:34] <+Blu_dudeX2> slaughter-man strikes again D:
[2:36:34] <%Atomik456> I always like the recent superman thing where Clark gets "Oh hey, you looklike Superman!" a lot American Alien I think?
[2:36:35] <%badchoice5> These quips are lackluster
[2:36:35] <+Tokanova> murderman is my favorite spider based hero
[2:36:35] <%ECRead> who's walkin the streets in ski masks
[2:36:36] <$Mornaka> @juncopartner I really liked the funeral episode
[2:36:38] <circular7> dead

[2:36:39] <dekkitout> cartoons saved my life LUL
[2:36:39] <Coystick> HE'S A CARTOON KILL HIM
[2:36:41] <%Rostichenburg> I imagine Myles will be another playable character ending in a fight where you trade off parts between heroes
[2:36:42] <Oxybe> that guy was killed by that manhole cover
[2:36:43] <EMP_Ike_Turner> QUIP THEM ALL PETER
[2:36:44] <ronyncato87> Hitting someone with a freaking manhole cover would kill them so hard
[2:36:45] <TheSpiritof2277> GET ME COMPLAINTS ABOUT SPIDERMAN
[2:36:45] <+Sadira_snack_attack> miles is on the best acid trip right now
[2:36:46] <%Keeble24> As much as i love this suit, its so distracting in cutscenes
[2:36:48] <+JenovasPuppet> Who Framed Peter Parker?
[2:36:48] <blackbookalpha> Get the Dip, Toon's in town
[2:36:49] <XHeavyfireX> God, don't use that outfit for cutscenes

[2:37:05] <+Bupkis7> enbNothanks
[2:37:05] <Shockmaster182> Are the original avengers like iron man and captain America just old geezers at this point, because I remember how a character bio mentions how when he was a little kid most of his peers were fanboys of the avengers
[2:37:07] <XHeavyfireX> Oh this is awful
[2:37:08] <%Keeble24> its so distracting omg

[2:55:17] <TheFilth> I think this is Peter's conscience, not literally Mr Negative
[2:55:18] <+JenovasPuppet> Norman did nothing wrong
[2:55:20] <wsintai> Why don't they just assassinate Norman Osborn? Like, he clearly has the resources @AngriestPat

[3:02:41] <FoulNightingale> !uptime
[3:02:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 2m 43s.
[3:02:42] <Lysdexic9541> It's almost 100 pounds
[3:02:42] <gyrogogozeppeli> is he done?
[3:02:43] <+Thorn14> Look at that hecking chonker

[3:03:00] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Paige is right.
[3:03:02] <+Thorn14> LUL
[3:03:04] <pillowwasp> This is so dramatic
[3:03:05] <%Rostichenburg> The game crashed several times for me which seems like a pretty big bug
[3:03:06] <element_of_loyalty> 2 2 2 2
[3:03:07] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Super hype music for absolutely nothing
[3:03:07] <sparrrow_> round up to the nearest ten thousand
[3:03:08] <+Tylermcd93> LUL
[3:03:09] <+Thorn14> This music makes this dumb argument the best
[3:03:10] <CrimsonSkeletons> Elmo is becoming stronger.
[3:03:10] <Dragon_Batman> it would round down tho
[3:03:12] <AncelDeLambert> the game has been building up Doc Oc and Green Goblin so hard, if they fuck it up it'll be the WORST
[3:03:13] <Lysdexic9541> LITERALLY MILLIONS
[3:03:14] <+libra_zero> @AngriestPat Isn't it funny that the Sable mercenaries are considered the best on the planet, despite them all being doucebag jobbers with garbage space guns?
[3:03:14] <%Fenrirlives> PAIGE CHECK UR PHONE
[3:03:16] <%Agami23> if its under 500 you round down

[3:07:08] <majinpickles> What up fat fuck
[3:07:08] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat Better hire Little V Mills then, shouldn't they?
[3:07:09] <AlasterAngelo> the Devil Trigger band is pure
[3:07:11] <%badchoice5> CAPCOM CANNOT KILL THE SONG! IT IS OMEGA!
[3:07:14] <%Keeble24> the video is so bad tho

[3:07:29] <%Keeble24> how fitting
[3:07:30] <Shinmaddrox> I feel people dug that up simply because they hated Dante's theme.
[3:07:34] <+Ell1ot> People keep calling CAPCOM to complain!
[3:07:35] <DeadBlu3ey3z> wasn't subhuman a nazi thing
[3:07:36] <flame_of_udun_> THATS A YIKES FROM ME DAWG
[3:07:36] <gyrogogozeppeli> hoooo boy
[3:07:37] <$ooblagis> Hey Pat, did you watch the new 15 minutes of Dante gameplay?
[3:07:40] <%bloodypurpledog> Just use Rules of Nature again
[3:07:41] <VERDAXY> Wait What happened?
[3:07:41] <%DedlokPM> @badchoice5 Not Devil Trigger. The one they released that was to be Dante's
[3:07:43] <TheFilth> @Shinmaddrox doing god's work
[3:07:47] <ape_hawk> WHICH IS A GOOD CHOICE

[3:07:57] <Zombrocom> It's back again though
[3:07:58] <+imextremelymanly> they have time to make a new song
[3:07:59] <%JaydenSai> Push Little V Mills for it
[3:07:59] <SchroedingersFerret> Suicide Silence is babby's first extreme metal band. It's the one everyone listens to in highschool before they develop taste.
[3:07:59] <dreu81> just hire mick gordan
[3:07:59] <Limes528> Just replace everything with Devil Trigger and it will be fine
[3:08:00] <HyruleGirl9> Thank you Capcpom you did a good thing this time
[3:08:00] <+Ssaik> LITTLE

[3:08:10] <Brutal_Defeat> just have lock and load and devil trigger
[3:08:10] <vectorcannonready> RIP TellTale
[3:08:11] <%SmolBluGhost> damg
[3:08:11] <%deviljhojho94> ALL OF THE CREEPERS INSIDE OF MY HEAD
[3:08:12] <%Fenrirlives> PUSH THEM TO HIRE LITTLE V MILLS
[3:08:13] <%JaydenSai> LITTLE V MILLS WOO
[3:08:13] <+Hinasil> Imagine being a big creepy pedo actually comes back to ruin your life, who would have guessed?
[3:08:17] <%SmolBluGhost> dang*
[3:08:18] <SchroedingersFerret> They're the COB of the 2010's.
[3:08:18] <%Agami23> just replace it with lock and loaded
[3:08:19] <gyrogogozeppeli> THAT TOTALLY IS WHAT HAPPENED
[3:08:20] <element_of_loyalty> press pass
[3:08:20] <TheFilth> whatever gets rid of the song
[3:08:22] <StarSkullyman> hopefully little v
[3:08:24] <Shinmaddrox> Butt rock and Latin lyrics are the only way to go with Dante.
[3:08:24] <+imextremelymanly> little V would be perfect
[3:08:25] <%PipIV> most definitely
[3:08:26] <gyrogogozeppeli> THATS SO TRUE
[3:08:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Ok, is this Better or worse than Sega's RAPEPLAY Arcade game
[3:08:29] <rosemon5001> it sucks for telltale
[3:08:30] <%badchoice5> THE SONG IS OMEGA
[3:08:32] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> You try to molest just one child and all of a sudden the whole internet turns on you!
[3:08:32] <AtlasMcCoy> Thats 100% true
[3:08:32] <%Keeble24> I can believe that
[3:08:33] <42nfl19> BUT DID PAIGE HEAR ABOUT THE DILDO ARM?
[3:08:34] <soraabora> whats the band?
[3:08:35] <$GohanEgret> in this era, it would be removed
[3:08:38] <TechDragon_Z> That song did not pull my devil trigger
[3:08:39] <flame_of_udun_> I CAN BELIEVE THAT
[3:08:39] <Dragon_Batman> could be totally possible but who knows
[3:08:41] <ape_hawk> it's cynical but you know it's true
[3:08:43] <DeadBlu3ey3z> it's not that good
[3:08:43] <%Agami23> pat tell paige about the dildo arm.
[3:08:43] <dreu81> what if it was devil trigger and the vocalist had been accused of assault
[3:08:43] <yendoria> It's more of a bonus
[3:08:48] <Archmortal> Would they have pulled it if it were still atrocious, but the entire community didn't tell them it sucks
[3:08:48] <+ElEversoris> GivePLZ lionSleep1 lionSleep2 TakeNRG
[3:08:49] <element_of_loyalty> YEA
[3:08:50] <+imextremelymanly> dildo arm?

[3:08:50] <+Thorn14> YES LUL
[3:08:55] <%PipIV> OH YEAH
[3:08:55] <yendoria> SWEET SURRENDER
[3:08:55] <+JenovasPuppet> The news about the past misdeads wouldn't have come out if the song were good :P
[3:08:58] <%Rostichenburg> I hope we can get an actually good replacement and not just use Devil Trigger for everyone
[3:08:59] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat why would they put the song in the first place?
[3:09:06] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Yeah it’s cynical but it’s also coming off as a bit far fetched, Pat...

[3:10:20] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat The Back And Shoulders thing is a reference to the fact that some people call their vibrators "shoulder massagers" to hide the fact that they have or are selling a sex toy
[3:10:21] <+bigb00gi3> stop all the downloadin

[3:16:54] <+smargh1015> @flame_of_udun_ i dont disagree, but arent they shifting to a new main character?
[3:16:55] <+Violated_Muffins> @AngriestPat First time watching in a while. How are you liking MHGU?

[3:17:14] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Oh shit, chibi Spooderman in the corner, notifying you that your controller’s disconnected!
[3:17:22] <wunderkonig> It's a game about an everlasting darkness slowly destroying the world
[3:17:23] <sosuke5> KH has too much 'JUST TALK' for Woolie
[3:17:24] <ape_hawk> ALL KINGDOM HEARTS LPS UNTIL KH3
[3:17:27] <grayjammer> Matt mentioned he played 1 and 2
[3:17:28] <Sinister_Aglet> FEET
[3:17:29] <%HiroTSK5> Liam's been putting in the work to get Liam to play KHII
[3:17:30] <wunderkonig> falls in with most Woolie plat playthroughs.
[3:17:31] <%Keeble24> WHO???
[3:17:33] <+JenovasPuppet> Matt/Woolie on KH1 could actually be pretty neat
[3:17:33] <flame_of_udun_> @smargh1015 touche
[3:17:34] <+RSNoon> DICKS OUT FOR BIG PUSS
[3:17:35] <juncopartner> I hope they do the same format as last year. Fewer shitstorm games but multiparters. Last year was pretty good.
[3:17:36] <%HiroTSK5> Woolie dammit
[3:17:37] <element_of_loyalty> GOOFY
[3:17:39] <%Unlimited_> I see feet
[3:17:39] <JDebss> Screw Liam
[3:17:40] <%Agami23> liam has been pushing for it to woolie in neir
[3:17:41] <%ToxInjection> One day, we will know what the fuck Kingdom Hearts is
[3:17:41] <thisisacoolguy> Liam is pushing woolie into playing it so should be easy
[3:17:43] <rytisone> Matt and Woolie are in denial
[3:17:46] <%Keeble24> [ R E T R A C T E D] ??
[3:17:48] <zal_silverfang> which will in turn make it make even LESS sense
[3:17:49] <%Cynful_Pleasures> I'm pushing a KH 3 playthrough on the channel
[3:17:53] <%Rostichenburg> Shin Yakuza is weird they're changing to a new character who is like 5 years younger than Kiryu when the point was to get a young fresh protag
[3:17:54] <extradopeness> Screw u
[3:17:54] <element_of_loyalty> WORMS
[3:17:55] <AlasterAngelo> Kingdom Hearts is light @ToxInjection

[3:18:01] <+JenovasPuppet> Like worms?
[3:18:01] <%Cynful_Pleasures> Just Matt and Woolie, completly blind
[3:18:06] <mercado94> Dont. A Kingdom Hearts LP will be a terrible idea
[3:18:06] <%PipIV> Matt and Woolie are trapped in the darkness
[3:18:08] <dekkitout> something something goofy, something something sora, something something disney's infinite ip
[3:18:08] <+Tarviti> The story makes plenty of sense the Xs in their names are secret tracking devices.
[3:18:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat, stop. gross toes

[3:18:17] <%Keeble24> LMAO
[3:18:18] <+Seheti> Kingdom hearts is dumb fun and nobody can take that away from me
[3:18:22] <%ToxInjection> I just wanted to quote ProZD BibleThump
[3:18:22] <wunderkonig> @ToxInjection was explained in one, again in two, once in birth by sleep, and I think the mobile phone game no one in america can play.

[3:18:26] <flame_of_udun_> The first Kingdom Hearts is a little rough to get through imo
[3:18:26] <+imextremelymanly> samurai are more precise
[3:18:28] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Cowboy's with swords is just ineffective

[3:19:40] <wunderkonig> @ToxInjection THe problem with kingdom hearts, is...Well imagine this. Imagine if in dark souls, the characters actually tried to explain the plot to you.

[3:19:47] <Avatar_Beifong> It's not
[3:19:47] <+shawntk_> No, not the minecraft game, the Minecraft show they are doing for Netflix
[3:19:48] <Freedom_EX> thats so dumb
[3:19:48] <flame_of_udun_> The formula was getting extremely tired
[3:19:51] <+JenovasPuppet> Contractually obligated
[3:19:52] <dreu81> did the telltale marvel game ever come out?
[3:19:53] <+Sadira_snack_attack> no its because they owe it to netflix
[3:19:54] <%HiroTSK5> Netflix gave the the money to barely finish it
[3:19:57] <strangelee> Now they have to play Minecraft
[3:19:57] <Avatar_Beifong> It's like the worst selling of their modern games
[3:19:59] <zal_silverfang> @AngriestPat time to finish the minecraft LP fucker
[3:20:00] <SchroedingersFerret> @AngriestPat When are you guys going to play 'Go! Go! Beckham! Adventure on Soccer Island' on the channel?
[3:20:05] <Dakuu75> How did they NOT get "severence pay" isn't that illegal... like straight up? or because of their contracts they have to signed they can get away with it?
[3:20:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I hope we get the Telltale game ABOUT Telltale
[3:20:05] <Rngiddion> They were posting on twitter that one of the devs just moved crosscountry to get a job there and is already out of a job in the most expensive area of the country to live in
[3:20:05] <hntronium> FINISH THE MINECRAFT LP
[3:20:06] <flame_of_udun_> @dreu81 yeah guardians of the galaxy
[3:20:06] <+smargh1015> havent all kids switched to fortnite at this point?
[3:20:08] <Captainahab_37> Telltale wants to see the let’s fail
[3:20:08] <darthravel> Take out EA and Ubiflop while the gods are at it
[3:20:09] <sileo_patronus> It's probably contract obligation
[3:20:10] <Kirijuo> Also a lot were contract and can't get unemployment
[3:20:12] <CatmanIX> walking dead would be way more lucrative tho
[3:20:13] <Dragon_Batman> Awww maihusbando you take care of that cat
[3:20:14] <DonatelloJose> @MaiHusbando9S WE NEED PICTURES
[3:20:16] <Shinmaddrox> we aint getting Tales from the Borderlands 2 nor The Wolf Among us. They just had to waste everyones time on fucking Walking dead and minecraft
[3:20:22] <+imextremelymanly> I really wanted to see the end of clementine story

[3:20:31] <+Sadira_snack_attack> and awful
[3:20:31] <%ToxInjection> @wunderkonig that's EVEN WORSE holy shit. I'm guessing buying that complete collection releasing on PS4 wouldn't be enough to get the whole picture either
[3:20:32] <TafferAA> DO IT

[3:41:40] <%korth367> video games

[3:41:42] <TheFilth> that's a drone
[3:41:42] <HoIlywood_SN> @FrostMass22 apparently not one of their games was successful after Walking Dead Season 1, they were all either underperforming or outright financial disasters

[3:42:12] <wunderkonig> Here's a question, why the hell would they leave working versions as display models?
[3:42:13] <mercado94> This is Oscorps Industries with a message: Keep your hair short
[3:42:14] <+mimikyu92> that seems like the perfect bioweapon dispersal device
[3:42:14] <%Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat You missed the cloaking device
[3:42:14] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> WHY IS THIS HERE
[3:42:15] <+smargh1015> someone set up us the bomb
[3:42:22] <+JenovasPuppet> Nice try
[3:42:23] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Paige when you cook is it difficult trying to remember Pat's gout? Or is it more of a non issue?
[3:42:24] <+pkmamsters> ow
[3:42:25] <wunderkonig> instead of say, plastic repilcas

[3:44:07] <+jkobe34> quick take a selfi
[3:44:09] <+JenovasPuppet> "Wear your best text"
[3:44:10] <$MightyMaxT> It's not SUPPOSED to be a bioweapon
[3:44:11] <Thirtine> It’s like the STARK brand missile
[3:44:11] <%rdark_ksu> it was supposed to be a miracle cure/. Like cure of polio level
[3:44:12] <+Meekest> "I dunno it's kind of a huge busy train terminal why is ANYONE ELSE here"

[3:44:59] <AlasterAngelo> BOOOOOOOOOO
[3:44:59] <HoIlywood_SN> see this paints Mary Jane in a very negative light because if she fucking told Spider-Man first this probably wouldnt have happened BECAUSE HE HAS A DIRECT LINE OF CONTACT WITH THE POLICE
[3:45:00] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 ok pat, here's your shill action for the day, for these bits, go to your texting app, close your eyes, swipe up, and stop it at a random point. Whoever you landed on, text them "poopy butthole farts" you are not even allowed to ACKNOWLEDGE that you texted this to them, nor explain.
[3:45:02] <mercado94> Ok this is cool
[3:45:02] <hntronium> Nobody is hearing that?
[3:45:08] <element_of_loyalty> SO MANY PAT FAULT DEATHS
[3:45:09] <EBT93> This was pretty cool
[3:45:12] <$MonsterEnvy> Man Li's plan is really fucking evil and could kill everyone in new work

[3:45:47] <%ToxInjection> @hoilywood_sn to be fair, they DO have a conversation about that at some point. Like they both learn to actually work as a team and communicate
[3:45:47] <AncelDeLambert> NO DUMBASS
[3:45:47] <wunderkonig> @MonsterEnvy Lee's plan is super evil and could kill everyone on the planet.
[3:45:53] <+imextremelymanly> thats a new yorker for you
[3:45:59] <gyrogogozeppeli> Jebaiting
[3:46:00] <%rdark_ksu> MJ: I suddenly know chinese!
[3:46:03] <AncelDeLambert> I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU.
[3:46:05] <wsintai> The problem with this plan is that he could kill ALL OF HUMANITY with this
[3:46:07] <element_of_loyalty> CHINESE
[3:46:07] <%PipIV> WHY IS HE LISTENING
[3:46:07] <%deviljhojho94> fucking new yorkers i swear to god
[3:46:10] <Hawkbone_> @rdark_ksu When was it ever implied that MJ suddenly knows chinese? She never directly responded to what he says.
[3:46:10] <+FadingEmber> MJ your not that important
[3:46:17] <+pkmamsters> "my plan is to PUUUNCH"
[3:46:23] <%deviljhojho94> BROOKLYN RAGE

[3:46:31] <HoIlywood_SN> @ToxInjection yeah but theres a point where she just looks like a selfish idiot and its been crossed
[3:46:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> To be fair, it looks like everyone's gonna die
[3:46:32] <EBT93> HOW DO THEY KNOW SHE WASN’T BLUFFING?!
[3:46:34] <%deviljhojho94> Shhh kid
[3:46:38] <AlasterAngelo> WHY CAN'T WE PLAY AS SPIDER MAN

[3:46:49] <%Rostichenburg> She knows Harry and therefore nows Norman personally
[3:46:51] <Sielas> The spider suit looks weird when it's not you playing

[3:47:08] <+JenovasPuppet> It's hard to see out of the masks
[3:47:11] <dekkitout> these masks have -6 visibility
[3:47:16] <gyrogogozeppeli> why is Mary Jane doing this tho, she shouldnt do anything tho
[3:47:18] <+imextremelymanly> 2
[3:47:18] <+mimikyu92> why do those drones have goggles
[3:47:20] <Sielas> HACKERMAN
[3:47:20] <Sinister_Aglet> best rap
[3:47:20] <element_of_loyalty> HACK
[3:47:21] <dewyweb> does not slap
[3:47:21] <+JenovasPuppet> Is that a rap/
[3:47:25] <TheFilth> lyrical masterpiece

[3:47:34] <%ToxInjection> @hoilywood_sn I can understand that. They show growth though, which I think is the most important aspect. She may act selfish but that can be unlearned.
[3:47:34] <element_of_loyalty> KISS
[3:47:34] <$birdfella> thats not a rap, its just a rhyme
[3:47:35] <Endocrom> Those masks REALLY screw with visibility

[4:05:16] <+mechslayer71> Paige not liking a chick means nothing. @angriestpat
[4:05:18] <$birdfella> or his girlfriend
[4:05:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Aleatorius she doesn't have kids tho
[4:05:23] <+twin_triggers> has always holding back
[4:05:23] <cherubsanonymous> Or some Spider-God thing

[4:05:28] <%NovaKnightmare> who would win 6 of Spider Man's greatest enemies or one blackface boi
[4:05:28] <gyrogogozeppeli> Pat is having fun, everyoneelse just hates MJ
[4:05:29] <%Divryne> MJ is probably the final boss. LUL
[4:05:29] <%Afterman_> his biggest enemy is poverty

[4:05:33] <rytisone> defeat MJ with the semen
[4:05:34] <dewyweb> MJ, the evil version of himself
[4:05:35] <AncelDeLambert> Paige's desire for woman murder grows
[4:05:35] <Lysdexic9541> Can Yuri be Pete's new woman?
[4:05:38] <%PipIV> Get here soon, Selena..
[4:05:38] <XHeavyfireX> His greatest enemy? WOMEN
[4:05:39] <Sielas> Spider-man vs Society
[4:05:40] <element_of_loyalty> AUNT MAY IS HIS FOE
[4:05:41] <Aleatorius> @ThatGuyfromMars we don't know her personal life
[4:05:47] <%badchoice5> J Jonah Jameson is always there for you Peter
[4:05:49] <$Mendin> Kingpin beat seven layers of stuffing out of you
[4:05:50] <Endocrom> Oh Mephisto... Oh wait.
[4:05:52] <%Ferakin> Any time in the comics that someone like Black Widow beats him up, mu eyes roll out of my head
[4:05:52] <%SuperCasualBoom> He answer that by breaking her neck
[4:05:54] <%deviljhojho94> HEY SUPAIDAMAN

[4:05:57] <zal_silverfang> guys come on this MJ is a total asshole..
[4:05:58] <+FadingEmber> MJ's weak to spider semen so he has her beat
[4:06:01] <Limes528> Not sure why Paige is so gung ho about this MJ hate
[4:06:02] <wunderkonig> Really his biggest villain is uncle Ben, who's speach on responsibility stopped him from becoming a super rich super athletic scientist who donates billions to chairty by the age of 18.
[4:06:02] <%commanderclaw> Drop MJ for Yuri
[4:06:02] <Prism_Wing> His life is his villain.
[4:06:03] <dekkitout> atleast there's shocker-chan
[4:06:04] <element_of_loyalty> FREEDOM TOWER
[4:06:05] <$MonsterEnvy> @AngriestPat Fun fact the Sinster Six generally does not talke him on togeather, but one at a time
[4:06:06] <thehornypastrypuffer> TOMBSTONE IS MORE LIKABLE THAN MJ
[4:06:12] <circular7> thirst, his greatest weakness
[4:06:12] <+fFailureatlife> @Limes528 paige hates women
[4:06:14] <alliedmastercompy> Pat, solving the one more day problem by avoiding the original marriage all together
[4:06:14] <+fFailureatlife> Kappa
[4:06:16] <gyrogogozeppeli> RUDE

[4:06:43] <%deviljhojho94> venting on people is an asshole thing to do
[4:06:44] <+fFailureatlife> its not thats the joke
[4:06:44] <+ATentacleMonster> Big Willie Kreygasm
[4:06:44] <dekkitout> "Officer, I will literally toss you, now IS NOT the time..."
[4:06:46] <wsintai> THAT IS THE DUMBEST JEEZ
[4:06:48] <%Farples> give it a minute...
[4:06:48] <Mnightshyamallama> big willie is great
[4:06:48] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat accepting fault is difficult for many many ppl
[4:06:48] <tearsaurther> @peachsaliva what's your opinion on how Mary Jane should've acted?
[4:06:51] <circular7> fuck you guy
[4:06:53] <+rogoho> Seriously
[4:06:53] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 alright guys time for an update on "the way home" I'm far too awake to go to sleep, so instead I'll work on my lab, problem is, it's at my aunt's house down the way, I'll text her ahead of time, but she'll be out cold, so I'll have to sneakily get in, not wake up my aunt, cousin, or her infant daughter, grab my shit, then sneak out. It's an old wooden place, so hopefully i won't get shot. Or if i do, it'll be in the head.
[4:06:54] <AncelDeLambert> This is a city of radio frequency tags
[4:06:57] <%SmolBluGhost> haven't played this game at all so its okay to assume that black cat needs to be a thing right?
[4:06:58] <hyphenated_q> He was thrown into a maximum security prison before going to trial???
[4:07:01] <Limes528> @AlasterAngelo Not really. They just gave her a character arc
[4:07:02] <%ToxInjection> She's stubborn as shit but I don't think she's insufferable. They're just arguing like a dumb old married couple.
[4:07:10] <ape_hawk> electro
[4:07:10] <+mimikyu92> isn't EVERY hero 'oh he's holding back, he could instagib you if he wanted too'? I'm tired of that, honestly.
[4:07:12] <Sielas> ALL THE WARRIORS
[4:07:13] <+walternatorz> electro
[4:07:13] <element_of_loyalty> TASK MASTER
[4:07:14] <%Owkono> probably all the webbed up criminals on ceilings
[4:07:15] <AlasterAngelo> @Limes528 is her character arc being a bitch and never facing repurcussions for it?
[4:07:17] <%sayaman012341> GET OVER HERE
[4:07:17] <$MightyMaxT> & SHOCKER?
[4:07:19] <%deviljhojho94> I think the problem is that peter doesnt really fight back, he just kinda takes it
[4:07:21] <%badchoice5> Some people recognize the simple beauty that is J Jonah Jameson
[4:07:24] <gyrogogozeppeli> they want MJ to be perfect girl who never fights back to Peter
[4:07:26] <CatmanIX> exactly pat, that's the point, that's how Alex Jones fanbase works
[4:07:28] <vivecdidnothingwrong> DONT FORGET SHOCKER
[4:07:32] <$Princepurple8> Ok it’s like 10pm where i am so imma go to bed, night guys.
[4:07:33] <+imextremelymanly> time for brute stealth
[4:07:34] <+fFailureatlife> @AlasterAngelo the game isnt over you moron
[4:07:35] <%Ferakin> The thing is MJ insists on putting herself in danger with people who can turn her into paste in a second
[4:07:43] <+JenovasPuppet> MJ will become the new Kingpin of Crime
[4:07:43] <+tigerfang86> MAXIMUM VIOLENCE
[4:07:43] <dekkitout> dont you mean wreak his 'Homecoming' tajC
[4:07:47] <element_of_loyalty> GUESS IT WAS NUTIN
[4:07:49] <%Ferakin> And then goes "Wah I can't believe you don't want me to do this!"
[4:07:50] <SchroedingersFerret> Why would they wear shit that says "FISK" on it?
[4:07:50] <gyrogogozeppeli> not a flawed character that is too over her head but has good intentions
[4:07:53] <Limes528> @AlasterAngelo What's the most bitchy thing she did in this game? Get mad at Peter cause he messed up her investigation?
[4:07:54] <Endocrom> Stop hitting yourself!
[4:07:56] <HoIlywood_SN> @gyrogogozeppeli the problem is that Mary Jane is doing this shit in a situation where if she fucks up thousands of people are going to die
[4:07:57] <Sielas> @dekkitout *slap*
[4:07:59] <%waddledoops> !uptime
[4:08:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 8m 1s.
[4:08:02] <%Divryne> CUM.
[4:08:03] <%SaltyDongs> Cum
[4:08:07] <AlasterAngelo> @Limes528 she got a dude killed literally 30 minutes ago
[4:08:08] <%MagickBurritoh> HAHA
[4:08:08] <element_of_loyalty> oysters
[4:08:08] <wunderkonig> @mimikyu92 Yeah it's a bit dumb but, gameplay. It's also the reason I hate superman. If he can move faster than the speed of light, and hear everything on earth at once and seperately, and also is all about the justice, crime should not exist.
[4:08:09] <%NovaKnightmare> pfffft
[4:08:15] <%SmolBluGhost> jizz
[4:08:15] <dekkitout> I deserve that holtzPF
[4:08:16] <Limes528> @AlasterAngelo Who?
[4:08:19] <%deviljhojho94> YEAH
[4:08:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Limes528 "We should talk." "I don't wanna talk right now."
[4:08:21] <XHeavyfireX> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[4:08:22] <AlasterAngelo> @Limes528 a cop
[4:08:30] <+fFailureatlife> @HoldBtoRun but no one died tho
[4:08:34] <JDebss> Are we still hatin' on MJ? I hate MJ.
[4:08:38] <%deviljhojho94> yeah
[4:08:39] <+fFailureatlife> wait wrong person
[4:08:40] <zal_silverfang> @gyrogogozeppeli i think it's more not blaming peter for all the problems and putting the safety of the city first beyond petty grudges and a desire to be a hero. she almost seems to have some superiority complex
[4:08:47] <%SolitudeOtM> Literally said "error, file not found" up at the top
[4:08:47] <element_of_loyalty> pornhub premium account
[4:08:53] <Limes528> @AlasterAngelo What cop?
[4:08:53] <vivecdidnothingwrong> I like MJ
[4:08:54] <%ToxInjection> I don't think she's doing anything any other investigative reporter wouldn't do in this type of world. Just seems more extreme cause superpowers
[4:08:55] <gyrogogozeppeli> @zal_silverfang more like inferiority complex
[4:08:56] <+Meekest> I don't like how they made MJ into Lois Lane in this game, her being a reporter super weirds me out
[4:08:58] <%Ferakin> I'm predisposed to hating on MJ because of how bland she is most of the time
[4:09:02] <gyrogogozeppeli> she wants to be a hero but she doesnt have powers
[4:09:02] <%deviljhojho94> Dan slott was part of the writing of this game and he hates MJ, he is probably responsible for this
[4:09:04] <Aleatorius> At least MJ didn't fuck Norman Osborn, am I right?
[4:09:07] <Sielas> ???
[4:09:08] <%SolitudeOtM> Fuck this guy
[4:09:08] <zal_silverfang> @gyrogogozeppeli yes sorry that one
[4:09:13] <rytisone> My penis tells me I like MJ
[4:09:13] <AncelDeLambert> oooh, fuck this guy
[4:09:14] <HoIlywood_SN> @wunderkonig Supermans powers are very overblown, he's typically kind of a jack of all trades, master of none in the Justice League and a lot of his stories that arent about space men fucking his asshole is more than just fighting, like talking down suicidal jumpers and family shit and whatnot
[4:09:15] <+fFailureatlife> @Meekest its based on here ultimate version
[4:09:16] <+walternatorz> let him die
[4:09:17] <dekkitout> GLASS HIM!
[4:09:18] <sosuke5> Why doesn't Peter just fuck Miles, or is he too young?
[4:09:20] <XHeavyfireX> @zal_silverfang Other way around, it's an inferiority complex
[4:09:20] <vivecdidnothingwrong> HES DEAD
[4:09:22] <%Ferakin> Like, any other love interest for Spidey is vastly more interesting
[4:09:23] <%NovaKnightmare> that cop is fucking DEAD

[4:09:39] <AncelDeLambert> there are so many military weapons in this city
[4:09:40] <HoldBtoRun> DEAD
[4:09:40] <Sinister_Aglet> JJ was right, spider-man's a menace!

[4:09:41] <AlasterAngelo> @Limes528 she was facing down Mr. Negative and screamed for ONE COP and he got murdererd instead of being taken hostage
[4:09:41] <HoIlywood_SN> dead
[4:09:42] <%NovaKnightmare> "shouldnt mess with the kingpin" - last words
[4:09:43] <+fFailureatlife> @HoldBtoRun i sent that to the wrong person sorru :P
[4:09:43] <b1gboss007> F
[4:09:45] <+Meekest> "Shouldn't have messed with the Kingpin" as he falls off the ledge
[4:09:45] <%Beough> M U R D E R E D
[4:09:47] <%SolitudeOtM> Felicia is so much better than MJ
[4:09:48] <filialpails> they're just asleep
[4:09:48] <+JenovasPuppet> "Shouldn't have messed with the AAAAAAAHHHHHH!"
[4:09:49] <TheFilth> does anyone remember Monster Ock from the 2000 Spider-man game?
[4:09:51] <%SmolBluGhost> kill count increased
[4:09:51] <AlasterAngelo> MJ is just really bad in this game
[4:09:52] <conflict1914> shouldn't have messed with him he says falling to his death
[4:09:53] <+tigerfang86> CLOUD JOKE
[4:09:56] <%Beough> S O U L S U S P E C T
[4:09:57] <HoIlywood_SN> @TheFilth the best
[4:09:58] <Sielas> THE POWER OF THE CLOUD
[4:09:59] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Oh fuck
[4:10:00] <+fFailureatlife> @AlasterAngelo thats kind of his job though
[4:10:05] <$Wafflum> FISK DID NOTHING WRONG Kappa
[4:10:06] <vbanej> the thing is Peter is overprotective. And that seem he literally wanted to leave the hostage crisis to get MJ to safety before doing anything about anyone else but she was against because she knew that saving day comes I
[4:10:07] <+fFailureatlife> to save civilians from people
[4:10:10] <dekkitout> 🌈 clooooud
[4:10:12] <+Bupkis7> COMIC CROTCH
[4:10:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Limes528 Sure.
[4:10:13] <$magikestral> MJ would be fine if they didn't fuck some things up. Like seriously, the texting scene was there just to have spidey text while swinging and being frustrated.
[4:10:15] <Mutanthunter> Monster ock was terrifying on ps1
[4:10:15] <+JenovasPuppet> Yet Pete's backbacks have been webbed up for YEARS!
[4:10:18] <element_of_loyalty> BULLET PROOF SPIDERMAN
[4:10:21] <%badchoice5> Arrest anyone you see webbed up #DueProcess
[4:10:22] <AlasterAngelo> @fFailureatlife YEAH THE ONE COP WAS GONNA DO SO MUCH
[4:10:25] <%Agami23> spidermanproof doors
[4:10:26] <wunderkonig> I think it's variable time webbing
[4:10:28] <$MonsterEnvy> cheer200 Fun fact most incarnations particularly the first one of the Sinister Six don't fight Spider Man together but instead 1 at a time. Cause none of them could agree to work together and all wanted to kill him on their own. So their plan was to attack him one at a time and and slowly wear him down until one of them won
[4:10:30] <powerprotoman> the msot fucked up thing you can do is dodge under someone while your about to get shot
[4:10:33] <srkAres> i mean.. the cops gotta forget some dudes every now and again. and when the web dissolves they still plummet to their death LUL
[4:10:33] <AncelDeLambert> Pat's greatest enemy: DOORS
[4:10:40] <AlasterAngelo> @fFailureatlife she never would've been in the situation to begin with if just told Peter
[4:10:41] <%deviljhojho94> The problem is that they only fucked up MJ, everyone else is pretty damn good
[4:10:47] <wunderkonig> Like web slinging webs last a few minutes, those boost webs dissolve instantaneously, some last a few hours, others are indefinate.
[4:10:52] <+fFailureatlife> they didnt fuck up mj
[4:10:58] <%deviljhojho94> yeah they did
[4:10:59] <HoIlywood_SN> @vbanej he is overprotective but also Mary Jane purposefully didnt tell him about the bomb device they were going to use to detonate a contagious bioweapon in Grand Central Station
[4:11:00] <%PipIV> they did
[4:11:01] <AlasterAngelo> they totally fucked up MJ
[4:11:05] <%deviljhojho94> hard
[4:11:05] <+Ssaik> It'S tHe EnD fOr YoU
[4:11:07] <+fFailureatlife> She didnt know it was gonna turn into a hostage situation
[4:11:08] <%SmolBluGhost> man the cops cant hit shit
[4:11:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Griffith did nothing wrong you guys
[4:11:09] <Limes528> @AlasterAngelo That's a huge leap in logic don't you think? What was she supposed to do? Keep silent so they could just stealth him, which is what they were going to do in the first place?
[4:11:11] <+CaptainJax> just like dmc2
[4:11:17] <$Wafflum> All helicopters are evil, Pat.
[4:11:21] <+JenovasPuppet> Oh no, not Police Officer!
[4:11:22] <element_of_loyalty> GO TO HEAVEN?
[4:11:24] <vbanej> I guess Mary Jane not being a bland cheerleader for Peter is f****** her up then
[4:11:26] <$MightyMaxT> They didn't screw MJ up. She feels useless and is taking it out on everyone and overly trying to prove herself.
[4:11:26] <+Gorgen> nice outfit dork
[4:11:27] <$magikestral> MJ has good things going for her, they just gave her bad situstions
[4:11:31] <zal_silverfang> ya know. that carpooling thing brings up a good point. most of these villians want money. yet have what would be assumed to be massively expensive tech. at what point does it not become a money sink and they actually make a profit?
[4:11:37] <%deviljhojho94> Man Fuck off, MJ was great in the comics
[4:11:39] <element_of_loyalty> DEAD
[4:11:41] <+Mikatonic> why don't they just shoot the cop? They're literally bad guys.
[4:11:42] <HoldBtoRun> DEAD
[4:11:44] <Sielas> Actually murdered
[4:11:44] <%SolitudeOtM> That guys dead
[4:11:46] <%deviljhojho94> she was always sassing pete
[4:11:48] <%PipIV> @limes528 call Peter Before shit hit the fan. she knew something was going to happen
[4:11:50] <+mimikyu92> can we just agree to disagree and sa their BOTH stupid?
[4:11:51] <AlasterAngelo> MJ is fantastic in the comics but they fucked her up here yeah
[4:11:51] <%deviljhojho94> but not in this way
[4:11:52] <+imextremelymanly> I hope the dmc 2 lp is not one of those no energy lp
[4:11:54] <AncelDeLambert> Yeah, instead of being a bland cheerleader, she's antagonistic, SO much better
[4:11:54] <TheFilth> if it ain't identical to the comics gtfo
[4:11:55] <HoIlywood_SN> @vbanej original Mary Jane wasnt a vapid cheerleader
[4:11:56] <gyrogogozeppeli> I hope in the next game MH does nothing but just be a trophy girlfriend who looks hot
[4:11:58] <gyrogogozeppeli> *MJ
[4:11:58] <29vigilanthand> Go Yosuke
[4:12:00] <Sielas> Talk about Morbius
[4:12:08] <%ToxInjection> that part is a matter of opinion. Other people here think she was done well, others think she's poorly done, and there's points on either side. I'm just happy they did something that feels different.
[4:12:09] <juncopartner> If Spiderman just sticks these guys to buildings and leaves you have to assume that they all get releasd immediately. I doubt spidrman is showing up in court to give evidnce. And I can't see guilt by being stuck to a building standing up in court
[4:12:10] <%rdark_ksu> Spiderman is the concept of a little brother in super hero form
[4:12:12] <+tigerfang86> SPIDER ALIEN
[4:12:13] <vivecdidnothingwrong> did someone say MORBIUS
[4:12:14] <+fFailureatlife> shes not antagonistic
[4:12:14] <Dragon_Batman> lol,
[4:12:15] <b1gboss007> Nah , mj being borderline suicidal isfucking her up
[4:12:16] <ape_hawk> ha
[4:12:18] <AlasterAngelo> @AncelDeLambert she's a supportive and loving wife in the comics and not a Lois Lane ripoff
[4:12:20] <rytisone> Queens are cell shaded
[4:12:22] <%SmolBluGhost> hah
[4:12:24] <element_of_loyalty> Queens is Mars
[4:12:27] <MementoExtasis> why does he only help manhattan then
[4:12:28] <Dragon_Batman> there ya go
[4:12:29] <%SolitudeOtM> Remember Morbius's creepy tentacles?
[4:12:30] <MementoExtasis> fuck u spiderman
[4:12:32] <Austin0097> Christopher Daniel Barnes was so great as Spider-Man in the 90s cartoon.
[4:12:35] <$Mendin> Spider-Man smells like sulfur, he has flies buzzing around him, le's a DEMON folks
[4:12:37] <TafferAA> queens is for the sequel
[4:12:39] <element_of_loyalty> SHOW US ELMO
[4:12:40] <+mimikyu92> he's from the Spider Verse
[4:12:41] <$Mendin> He sold his wife to the Devil
[4:12:44] <TheMilhouseExperience> Doxxed
[4:12:45] <%deviljhojho94> Fuck the police. But also yay police
[4:12:46] <Flyrant> what's funny is spider man is voiced by Yuri. And Yuri Watanabe is voiced by his wife.
[4:12:47] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Didn’t the 90s cartoon bring in Uncle Ben during the finale?
[4:12:48] <DXLelouch24> HERE
[4:12:50] <DXLelouch24> WE
[4:12:50] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Wasn't Queens in the Ultimate Spiderman game?
[4:12:51] <+tigerfang86> OH BOY

[4:13:12] <%rdark_ksu> and here we see the reve lay a ton
[4:13:13] <Limes528> @PipIV She didn't think it would be an actual terrorist attack. They're clearly setting up this trust character arc and it's like people don't think it's gonna pay off or something
[4:13:13] <wunderkonig> @Flyrant YOU MEAN THE BEST SHIP IN THE GAME IS VOICED BY A MARRIED COUPLE!?
[4:13:15] <element_of_loyalty> THANOS
[4:13:15] <$magikestral> MJ from this game could be good if given the right environment. I don't think they gave her that
[4:13:16] <EBT93> HERE IT COMES
[4:13:16] <%deviljhojho94> ITS HAPPENING
[4:13:18] <%badchoice5> MODOK TIME
[4:13:18] <rytisone> WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?

[4:13:28] <HoIlywood_SN> OCK
[4:13:28] <$Wafflum> It'll be FIIIIINE!
[4:13:29] <Klarrann3> is he level 41, yet?
[4:13:29] <Dragon_Batman> it's ok
[4:13:29] <$MonsterEnvy> cheer200 The Spectacular Spiderman man show is great and you should check it out sometime if you liked the 90s show
[4:13:29] <ape_hawk> everyone's happy, no loose ends, goodbye
[4:13:30] <+mimikyu92> This is gonna be hype/sad/cool, isn't it?
[4:13:31] <$RaikenTB> Just found out Telltale is dead NotLikeThis
[4:13:32] <+fFailureatlife> oh by the way
[4:13:33] <dewyweb> Doc is pissed he has to play for Splatoon now
[4:13:35] <gyrogogozeppeli> LOOK AT THAT EVIL SUIT
[4:13:35] <%violetheart> He's IN THE SUIT
[4:13:37] <+fFailureatlife> Yuri is best girl
[4:13:37] <%ToxInjection> The suit is so distracting holy fuck LUL
[4:13:37] <%SolitudeOtM> Look at that villian suit
[4:13:38] <HoIlywood_SN> fucking right there
[4:13:38] <%deviljhojho94> YEAH
[4:13:40] <+tigerfang86> HE'S SMASHED
[4:13:41] <%SaltyDongs> he is
[4:13:42] <vivecdidnothingwrong> YEAH
[4:13:42] <Blastotron> So why does improving the human body include HUGE EVIL STABBY CLWS
[4:13:43] <$Mendin> Booze and AIM mugs
[4:13:43] <dekkitout> he looks uncomfortable
[4:13:45] <element_of_loyalty> His ass is Sore
[4:13:45] <+fFailureatlife> like ill defend mj
[4:13:47] <arcaderabbit48> That suit is not flattering on him
[4:13:48] <+imextremelymanly> why the claws
[4:13:48] <AncelDeLambert> he's limping like crazy
[4:13:49] <zal_silverfang> @gyrogogozeppeli it always seems to be odd extremes with MJ as far as i have seen. it's either her just "being there" or being so desperate and naggy of wanting to be a super hero Peter relents and puts her in massive dangers as she acts recklessly. she never seems to be a balance character
[4:13:49] <+Arkfyre> NOT EVIL AT ALL
[4:13:50] <mtgtin> LOOK AT HOW EVIL THEY LOOK
[4:13:50] <HoIlywood_SN> there he is

[4:13:56] <+Pat_Squared> I MADE THESE EVIL ASS ARMS
[4:13:57] <Jslicerx> They look so cool in this game!

[4:14:07] <element_of_loyalty> GTE HIM HIS GOGGLES
[4:14:07] <Sundz15> MENACING
[4:14:08] <Flyrant> he gave them scary claws for no reason in particular
[4:14:08] <corn_on_fire> "okay but why do they look evil tho"
[4:14:08] <AncelDeLambert> why would you design them to look evil, Oc!
[4:14:09] <%rdark_ksu> wait for it
[4:14:09] <HoIlywood_SN> TWO
[4:14:11] <%deviljhojho94> fucking phenomenal
[4:14:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> uh....
[4:14:14] <Endocrom> Did you have to make them look like evil monster arms?
[4:14:15] <element_of_loyalty> YEA
[4:14:16] <Sinister_Aglet> HES DOING THE THING
[4:14:18] <dalishprince> he did the thing!
[4:14:18] <HoldBtoRun> he's doing it yeyeyeye
[4:14:20] <conflict1914> did he have to make them look evil though?
[4:14:20] <%deviljhojho94> This is straight up the best doc ock ever
[4:14:21] <dekkitout> "THOSE LOOKS AWESOME, GIVE ME A SET, BUT GOLD PLATED!"

[4:14:24] <+imextremelymanly> puzzle time
[4:14:29] <vivecdidnothingwrong> Fat model
[4:14:29] <JDebss> lol
[4:14:29] <%bevyrage> prepare for a ton of errors
[4:14:29] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat They collapse int the back. The other 2 are fully iside
[4:14:30] <Austin0097> OH, OH NO!
[4:14:31] <+mimikyu92> he's gotta be cracking the fucking ground with those claws
[4:14:31] <lloyddboy> THE CHIN
[4:14:32] <VentusHero> oh i remember doing this
[4:14:32] <%Suplex9000> I love Doc Ock
[4:14:33] <%rdark_ksu> SKIP SKIP SKIP
[4:14:34] <VritraReiRei> How did we go from HANDS to SPIKED CLAWS??? NotLikeThis
[4:14:35] <+walternatorz> fatal puzzles
[4:14:36] <+tigerfang86> UM
[4:14:36] <HoIlywood_SN> cool chin
[4:14:36] <ape_hawk> "HERE, DO THIS MINIGAME TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH YOU FUCKED UP"
[4:14:37] <wunderkonig> dock ock's gotta done and cocked it up.
[4:14:38] <AncelDeLambert> HOW FAT IS HE!?
[4:14:39] <+fFailureatlife> @deviljhojho94 well we certainly agree on that
[4:14:40] <XHeavyfireX> Doc got super cocky, cuz he's super desperate
[4:14:42] <$Wafflum> I see no problems here! 4Head
[4:14:42] <Tearonex> LAST NERD PUZZLES
[4:14:42] <Limes528> He got the parts from AIM. Modok probably added the spikes himself
[4:14:43] <%badchoice5> MORALITY CORE NOT FOUND
[4:14:44] <fmc009> science
[4:14:44] <element_of_loyalty> FAIL HIM
[4:14:45] <VentusHero> i love cinematic motion in game form
[4:14:47] <dewyweb> he really fucked this up
[4:14:51] <AncelDeLambert> His spine is in his stomach!
[4:14:53] <%Rostichenburg> Why'd he turn them from arms to claw tentacles
[4:14:53] <circular7> it scary how smooth things are going
[4:14:55] <gyrogogozeppeli> @zal_silverfang thing is, if MJ was relegated to the loving caring gf/wife, she'd do nothing but be that a boring character. Aunt May already has that role of a loving caring person.
[4:14:55] <Clu_Flynn> I'M AN OCTOPUS NOW
[4:14:56] <%deviljhojho94> @fFailureatlife It would be impossible not to!
[4:14:59] <Sielas> ???
[4:15:01] <+dklordg> these ones are actually the easiest in the games I feel, for story purposes
[4:15:02] <Limes528> Doc sucks at Bioshock 2 puzzles
[4:15:08] <+imextremelymanly> fuck it up you know what'll happen if you dont
[4:15:08] <Mutanthunter> This puzzle music is pretty good
[4:15:13] <Flyrant> I'm sure everything will work out fine
[4:15:17] <Austin0097> @Rostichenburg BECAUSE SCIENCE!
[4:15:18] <wunderkonig> You know, villains have a real, technology sharing problem in this universe, they team up all the time but never share any tech to take down the heroes.
[4:15:19] <+fFailureatlife> so remember guys
[4:15:22] <gyrogogozeppeli> So many errors
[4:15:22] <element_of_loyalty> DEAD
[4:15:23] <%deviljhojho94> @imextremelymanly He is right
[4:15:25] <%deviljhojho94> You need to fuck it up
[4:15:25] <ape_hawk> so, i actually really like how the puzzles in this section tell you how badly otto fucked up and how peter had to fix it, but its still too late
[4:15:28] <%Kage_96> @Limes528 It was bioshock 1 but I get the joke
[4:15:33] <%badchoice5> WE A SQUID NOW
[4:15:34] <%ToxInjection> All the shit is FUCKED
[4:15:35] <wunderkonig> Could you imagine lightning scorpion rhino with octopus limbs?
[4:15:35] <circular7> not enough tension in this music
[4:15:35] <+tigerfang86> MINIGAMES REPRESENT BACKSTORY
[4:15:38] <+fFailureatlife> otto fucked it up because his brain shit
[4:15:39] <+mimikyu92> Ock's brain is melting as we speak
[4:15:41] <AlasterAngelo> @wunderkonig they tried that once and Dr. Doom just kicked everybody's asses and stole all the technology
[4:15:43] <wunderkonig> and the ability of flight
[4:15:48] <Flyrant> no way Pat!
[4:15:49] <gyrogogozeppeli> Its like programming, the more you fix the more you fuck up
[4:15:50] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat you are actively creating Doc Ock right now
[4:15:52] <%deviljhojho94> he is getting 300 aunerysms right now
[4:15:54] <+LotS__> Pat, don't fuck this up and turn him into a supervillain
[4:16:00] <AncelDeLambert> Doc about to go nutso
[4:16:06] <Limes528> @Kage_96 Woops. Both of those games kinda melded together in my brain
[4:16:11] <wunderkonig> @AlasterAngelo Makes sense, but this games a good example where Doom does not exist, and they don't really share any tech.
[4:16:12] <zaptar13> You're making him stronger
[4:16:12] <%MagickBurritoh> Shouldn't peter turn off the shit before rewiring it?
[4:16:13] <AncelDeLambert> Danger, danger, HIGH VOLTAGE!
[4:16:16] <+imextremelymanly> nice
[4:16:17] <%NovaKnightmare> imagine leaving out something in the code and it makes a man criminally insane
[4:16:21] <+fFailureatlife> OH NO
[4:16:21] <dekkitout> Otto just wanted to live a peaceful science life
[4:16:21] <element_of_loyalty> DIE
[4:16:25] <+walternatorz> if you're gonna mess him up, just make sure he's a vegetable
[4:16:30] <%deviljhojho94> Please, STOP PRAYING FOR DOC OCK, YOU AR EMAKING HIM TOO POWERFUL
[4:16:34] <+tigerfang86> MINIGAMES REPRESENT THE POWER OF DOC OCK
[4:16:35] <gyrogogozeppeli> BibleThump
[4:16:36] <VentusHero> DR. OCK wants a quiet life
[4:16:39] <conflict1914> PETER YOU PONCE TELL HIM TO TAKE IT OFF THEN
[4:16:40] <%rdark_ksu> Paige writes her poems in morose code with her freckles
[4:16:47] <%badchoice5> JUST MAKE SURE TO KILL HIM LIKE THE REST OF THE VILLAINS PETER
[4:16:48] <element_of_loyalty> 'Whats going on in there Peter"? - Doc Oc
[4:16:52] <+fFailureatlife> i love these thematic puzzles
[4:16:53] <+mimikyu92> is Ock just sitting there, wondering why peter's freaking out at the computer?
[4:16:59] <AlasterAngelo> @wunderkonig things are more limited in just Spider-Man's rogue gallery, to be fair. Ock's field of expertise can't necessarily help like Shocker's suit. I get what you're saying though
[4:17:01] <XHeavyfireX> Yes
[4:17:10] <$Mendin> Seriously you keep letting the man with DEGENERATIVE NERVE-MUSCLE-CONTROL DISEASE do the intricate fine wirework on something he then plugs into his brain
[4:17:12] <zal_silverfang> @gyrogogozeppeli ya know what they need to do? to get past the whole "why do you love/have to protect the city over X relationship" or whatever? just having her as the friend. like, literally having her attempt to be an equal to peter on her own merits. and just drop any attempts at relationship in the bin. at the very least it would be an interesting attempt at a new idea right? all the problems with her character stems from the relationship aspect and how peter "heros too much"
[4:17:16] <zaptar13> Doc take that shit off it's exploding your brain

[4:23:21] <%NovaKnightmare> you mean his penis?
[4:23:22] <+Nomicro4u> AUNT MAY IS MAKING MUSTARD AND BREAD SANDWICH
[4:23:23] <+JenovasPuppet> Mustard is literally for homeless people.
[4:23:24] <+fFailureatlife> yes
[4:23:25] <Water_Isopod> the bread looks so thin
[4:23:25] <%rdark_ksu> As someone who worked at a homeless/food shelter back in HS if you can look into local volunteer opportunities if you have the time. Everyone deserves a good meal
[4:23:26] <%deviljhojho94> fuck off rolph
[4:23:29] <XdaXcaptainX> Aunt may definitely knows
[4:23:30] <+fFailureatlife> she super does
[4:23:31] <+StriderGerry> OOF
[4:23:31] <+Pat_Squared> I think one of the things that kinda bugged me about the movie Doc Ock, is that he was just a regular guy, but he took so many punches from spider-man and was fine
[4:23:32] <XHeavyfireX> If MJ just chugged mustard she'd be a lot happier
[4:23:33] <juhbathehutt> I'm a red head and I fucking LOVE mustard
[4:23:34] <%deviljhojho94> BEST IN THE WORLD
[4:23:34] <HoIlywood_SN> @scorpiozilla well to be fair that was because Spider-Man kept punching him in the skull
[4:23:34] <+mimikyu92> FUCKS SAKE
[4:23:35] <Limes528> @HoIlywood_SN that sucks. Luckily I missed it
[4:23:35] <zal_silverfang> i am still FUCKIN SICKENED that paige drank a whole thing of Mustard like it was nothing

[4:23:48] <Austin0097> Thanks for the info, I am not the most familiar with the character of Doc Ock outside of the cartoons and movies (and this game of course) so I thought that what they did with his character in this game was super neat.
[4:23:48] <+Tarviti> Peters gone time to drink my mustard.

[4:28:20] <TheMilhouseExperience> Safe and paralyzed.
[4:28:27] <+Nomicro4u> I mean they just watched him throw a dude 30 feet into the air and toss him like a sack of potatoes
[4:28:27] <%SaltyDongs> jump into the ocean
[4:28:28] <+mimikyu92> Ultron must be literally burning down europe if the Avengers aren't here
[4:28:28] <circular7> you were told in the podcast it ramps up quick pat
[4:28:31] <%Rostichenburg> How would they get off the island

[4:28:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Nomicro4u I could get some good hits in tho
[4:28:35] <Endocrom> Armed goons? no problem. Bare handed prisoners? pfffffff
[4:28:38] <+Gorgen> has he tried the infinity war suit?
[4:28:40] <+Pat_Squared> always wondered why they would keep all the supervillains so close to the city
[4:28:40] <%Afterman_> they can swim reaaaal good

[4:28:52] <%sayaman012341> WHAT PRISON HOLDS ROCKET LAUNCHERS
[4:28:52] <Estuko> @Prism_Wing Spider-MAn movie game technique??
[4:28:53] <%NovaKnightmare> Wheres Daredevil? wheres Moon Knight? WHERES PUNISHER???
[4:28:56] <thehornypastrypuffer> man last stand spider man would be sick in this sequence
[4:28:59] <Endocrom> Because of course rocket launchers.
[4:28:59] <EBT93> Pat’s turning into Spider-Man
[4:29:00] <wunderkonig> @wsintai Rhino.
[4:29:00] <HoIlywood_SN> @mimikyu92 well the Avengers are more or less an enhanced counter-terrorism unit, so a prison riot is way below their paygrade
[4:29:00] <conflict1914> WHY DO YOU KEEP ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN A PRISON
[4:29:01] <pabloelenano2> @AtlasMcCoy rhino?
[4:29:02] <%badchoice5> Why exactly do guards need rocket launchers?
[4:29:02] <$RaikenTB> why would there be rocket launchers in a prison? NotLikeThis
[4:29:02] <%deviljhojho94> everyone GET THE FUCK OUT
[4:29:02] <corn_on_fire> NA cops LUL
[4:29:02] <IntrepidEye> Why does a prison have rocket paunchers
[4:29:02] <%PipIV> CO's are slacking
[4:29:04] <XdaXcaptainX> WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ROCKET LUNCHERS IN NY
[4:29:06] <$Mendin> Hey it's the start of Devil's Third
[4:29:08] <+Nomicro4u> Like if they have weapons like guns sure, but trying to punch a super human???
[4:29:08] <Lysdexic9541> Why would a prison have rocket launchers?
[4:29:10] <%ToxInjection> why ARE there RPGs at Ryker's?
[4:29:10] <+JenovasPuppet> Naw the Raft is fine
[4:29:12] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Why rockets? Here?
[4:29:13] <+Sadira_snack_attack> why would a prison armory have rockets?
[4:29:16] <AncelDeLambert> WHY!!
[4:29:17] <%Afterman_> depends on the bear. black bear? black bears are pussies and will run. brown? eehhh..id say maybe 30. but polar bear? shits fuckd
[4:29:18] <wunderkonig> Because Rhino
[4:29:19] <%badchoice5> Oh, because Rhino
[4:29:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> They're stun rockets
[4:29:21] <%deviljhojho94> rockets are for the EXTRA bad guys 4Head
[4:29:23] <circular7> prison armory has rocket launchers LUL
[4:29:26] <wunderkonig> although
[4:29:27] <wunderkonig> fun fact
[4:29:28] <%Afterman_> stun rockets
[4:29:28] <sleepycorpse> WHERE ARE THE AVENGERS?!
[4:29:28] <%violetheart> @Sadira_snack_attack Because you might have to put down the Rhino in a prison riot.
[4:29:29] <pabloelenano2> to every one asking for rockets in prison just remember...rhino
[4:29:30] <+Sadira_snack_attack> lol stun rockets
[4:29:31] <%sayaman012341> THANK YOU
[4:29:31] <%ToxInjection> Rhino's at the RAFT though?
[4:29:34] <+ATentacleMonster> it's a fucking comic book game chat goddamn LUL
[4:29:34] <wunderkonig> If you zoom in on the rockets in camera mode
[4:29:34] <%PipIV> Pepper rockets
[4:29:36] <Prism_Wing> @estuko And all the 3D games before it.
[4:29:36] <element_of_loyalty> MERICAQ
[4:29:37] <wunderkonig> one of the lines on them says
[4:29:39] <ape_hawk> wow, that's a big lamp shade
[4:29:40] <+Gorgen> They have rockets cause this is a prison for tanks
[4:29:41] <+JenovasPuppet> Video game designers
[4:29:42] <wunderkonig> garunteed to kill spiders.
[4:29:43] <Austin0097> @conflict1914 To be fair, in a reality where Super Villains are a somewhat common occurrence it's not that surprising in my opinion.
[4:29:45] <CatmanIX> WHY THE FUCK DOES THE PRISON HAVE ROCKET LAUNCHERS
[4:29:46] <%SmolBluGhost> If i had the knowledge that the city was pretty much run by heroes with incredible abilities, breaking out of prison would be that last thought
[4:29:47] <%PipIV> beanbag rockets
[4:29:51] <+Sadira_snack_attack> Rhino isn't at rykers, hes at the raft
[4:29:52] <+dklordg> US police force has become more and more militarized in respects to equipment cause we just have an overabundance due to war, so thus rockets and the such
[4:29:55] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Everyone note that this is Ryker’s, not the Raft where supervillains are held...
[4:29:56] <$RaikenTB> LUL
[4:29:57] <+Pat_Squared> @Austin0097 It was just a random sound bug where it turned into a kingdom hearts trailer with no music or sound effects and a whole character's voice missing
[4:29:57] <%korth367> uh
[4:29:57] <+FadingEmber> Why would cops need rocket launchers in the first place?
[4:29:57] <AlasterAngelo> uhhhh
[4:29:57] <%deviljhojho94> LUL
[4:29:58] <wsintai> nani>?
[4:29:58] <ape_hawk> ahahahhaha
[4:29:59] <AtlasMcCoy> Uh
[4:29:59] <%Afterman_> isnt the raft near rykers tho
[4:29:59] <alcors_wisdom> oh shit
[4:30:00] <%badchoice5> Lol, the whole chat just went from "Why rockets" to "oh Rhino, right" at the same pace
[4:30:01] <ape_hawk> clip that
[4:30:01] <Dragon_Batman> lol nice
[4:30:03] <%SaltyDongs> spider slide
[4:30:04] <%Rostichenburg> The Raft is a separate building next door why would they need rockets here
[4:30:05] <Estuko> @Prism_Wing It's been too many years LUL I played the movie game for ps2 the most
[4:30:07] <%SmolBluGhost> oPE
[4:30:10] <%deviljhojho94> EWW GROSS
[4:30:11] <IntrepidEye> Just use a web bomb pat
[4:30:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Spidermans TRUE power
[4:30:13] <thehornypastrypuffer> YURI IS SO MUCH MORE USFULL THAN MJ
[4:30:15] <wunderkonig> Yes supervillains are stored on the raft, but, if Rhino escapes and attacks somewhere then what.
[4:30:16] <alcors_wisdom> who knew there would be bugs in SPIDERman
[4:30:17] <%Afterman_> pat use gadgets
[4:30:18] <HoIlywood_SN> @Rostichenburg because the raft is next door
[4:30:18] <Limes528> Spidey's got that Kenshiro tech
[4:30:22] <element_of_loyalty> STOP FIRIING ITS SPIDERMAN
[4:30:23] <%ToxInjection> I mean I guess the RAFT is right next door, so it isn't too weird
[4:30:28] <+mimikyu92> sudden power outage? perhaps... ELECTRO?
[4:30:31] <juncopartner> So a prison doesn't have a massive network of backup gennys?
[4:30:36] <Estuko> I miss that mach speed punch from Web of Shadows
[4:30:39] <%badchoice5> HE'S JUST TAZING THEM PAT
[4:30:40] <Austin0097> @Pat_Squared That's unfortunate, hopefully they manage to patch it at some point in the future.
[4:30:41] <zal_silverfang> @badchoice5 well i mean, we assumed the walking tank of a man would be in the, ya know, SUPER MAX PRISON???
[4:30:43] <+imextremelymanly> hes not dead just paralyzed from the shoulder down
[4:30:49] <Clu_Flynn> Yuri is top waifu, MJ is a confirmed thot
[4:30:51] <%SmolBluGhost> he can wait cant he?
[4:30:51] <Shraquet> Quips are the best ability.
[4:30:52] <Estuko> @juncopartner much less a SUPER PRISON FOR SUPER VILLAINS
[4:30:54] <AtlasMcCoy> BODIED
[4:30:55] <%Afterman_> now the tank man is the SUPER SUPER max
[4:30:55] <%PipIV> @dklordg but correction officers still wouldn't have access to this shit. but sure, 'merica
[4:30:56] <%deviljhojho94> waow
[4:30:58] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Pretty sure the Raft’s offshore, not next door here...
[4:30:59] <vbanej> people in the Marvel Universe are naturally more resilient and capable of taking damage than people in our world
[4:30:59] <EBT93> Yuri is best girl
[4:31:02] <BakedBam> that skin is playing with my eyes
[4:31:03] <%Afterman_> also yes, this is america
[4:31:07] <+JenovasPuppet> Maybe time to take off Quips
[4:31:09] <Dragon_Batman> he's using the gadgets yay
[4:31:14] <%Afterman_> im pretty sure most bumpkin pds have rocket launchers and army tanks these days
[4:31:14] <%Superstarsage> That's mean
[4:31:16] <Estuko> @Clu_Flynn I love Yuri she hits my mature lady of the law spot
[4:31:19] <+mimikyu92> is rhino even tough without his suit? I thought he just had a mini-mecha?
[4:31:20] <HoIlywood_SN> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap its literally right next to this prison, you can see it in the cutscene, its like a 5 minute swim away
[4:31:21] <%SaltyDongs> wow he saved him
[4:31:22] <+dklordg> @PipIV yeh, that's fair
[4:31:22] <wunderkonig> Anyone else do the web them up, uppercut, pull down combo for quick takedowns?

[4:32:23] <Veenok> wait Wardens drive squad cars?
[4:32:24] <TafferAA> just found out the OP combo of web bomb plus concussive blast
[4:32:26] <HoIlywood_SN> okay so heres my idea for Spider-Man 2, Style Switching and Spider-Arms, you defeat a villain and get a new weapon
[4:32:28] <%NovaKnightmare> what did they feed that guy? other prisoners?
[4:32:28] <Endocrom> You can do it tubby
[4:32:28] <thehornypastrypuffer> WHAT IS THIS WORLD WAR Z HORSESHIT
[4:32:28] <Flyrant> gadgets are OP
[4:32:30] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @hoilywood_sn oh...alright, that’s not as offshore as I thought,...but I guess that’s still offshore? I mean, there has to be a reason it’s called the Raft....
[4:32:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Did someone have the prison layout tattooed on their back?
[4:32:36] <+JenovasPuppet> Trip wire thugs together for trophy
[4:32:38] <%deviljhojho94> big boy

[4:33:13] <+FadingEmber> Pat realizes his early hyperbolic statement about gadgets was wrong... what a shcoker
[4:33:15] <%Afterman_> i think between rykers and the raft, the "smart" prisoners are in the raft tbh
[4:33:16] <HoIlywood_SN> VANESSA GET MY HORN
[4:33:25] <%deviljhojho94> the xmen are getting fucked by sentinels rn
[4:33:25] <zal_silverfang> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap youd think instead of being off shore they would have it like, underwater. "yeah? broke out? good luck swimming fucker"
[4:33:28] <wunderkonig> Considering all the shit that goes down in this city, a prison cell is probably the safest place.
[4:33:31] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @hoilywood_sn why are these places so fucking close to the city
[4:33:34] <%deviljhojho94> also insomniac xmen game when
[4:33:34] <count_bob> Spiderman, did you break that dude's neck?

[4:33:51] <+Sadira_snack_attack> Yuri is so encouraging
[4:33:51] <Flyrant> according to Kotaku, this sequence should be more woke

[4:34:51] <Austin0097> If he lets prisoners who were possibly already on death row die, does it still count as murder?
[4:34:51] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @wunderkonig yeah, but this one’s got super powered assholes. One would usually want them wayyyyy far away from heavily populated areas

[4:35:06] <DownPlayTwitch> Boy I wonder who will be revealed to be the mastermind at the end of this scene that E3 showed. It could be annnnyone
[4:35:08] <wunderkonig> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap it's probably holding for the negative zone then.
[4:35:09] <%ToxInjection> Vulture is still a super jobber
[4:35:10] <EBT93> ELECTRO IS SO COOL
[4:35:11] <AncelDeLambert> How did he get his SUIT back?!

[4:35:15] <alcors_wisdom> yuri pull a gun
[4:35:15] <29vigilanthand> Yuri needs to shoot electro with her gun
[4:35:16] <bluebird356> lol that suit really takes ya outta it
[4:35:17] <%SaltyDongs> sup nerd
[4:35:17] <$magikestral> @pat_squared the game DOES imply he had it once
[4:35:18] <+fFailureatlife> @Pat_Squared look at his scar
[4:35:20] <AlasterAngelo> S H O C K E R
[4:35:20] <zal_silverfang> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap no shit. as soon as anyone breaks out. BAM all escape water pods deploy after a few mins. anyone else has to fend. also, a second smart idea is SCUTTLING THEIR FUCKING EQUIPMENT INSTEAD OF HAVING IT LOCKED UP WITH THEM
[4:35:20] <HoIlywood_SN> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap its weird too because The Raft was in the Civil War movie and thats a universe where most of the villains are fucking dead, and its in the middle of the ocean
[4:35:22] <element_of_loyalty> Adam Sandler?
[4:35:22] <%deviljhojho94> His scar is star shaped PogChamp
[4:35:24] <+SolidusRex> I love Electro in this game.

[4:35:31] <thisisacoolguy> i love fire works
[4:35:32] <Estuko> I wish Yuri fought alongside you, would be rad
[4:35:34] <AncelDeLambert> Half these guys use suits, the damn things should be in MILITARY bases!
[4:35:34] <AtlasMcCoy> So question. Why was electro's weapons in the same prison as electro?
[4:35:35] <%PipIV> Electro wants a piece of Spidey
[4:35:37] <hyphenated_q> How many helicopters has spiderman crashed so far tonight?
[4:35:38] <+JenovasPuppet> Why would the even put evil red lights on those things?
[4:35:38] <XdaXcaptainX> electro isnt a jobber but hes still super fucking dorky and lame
[4:35:38] <%Afterman_> speaking of infamous..
[4:35:40] <+Pat_Squared> but I want it allll the time
[4:35:40] <wsintai> How did he get his suit back? Did they keep Electro's suit in the prison?
[4:35:40] <+imextremelymanly> all da enemy
[4:35:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @badchoice5 LUL
[4:35:43] <Futurecity10> So like, why isnt every prisoner being gunned down?
[4:35:46] <%Afterman_> flashback tot hat guy dressed as the SS mc
[4:35:48] <HoIlywood_SN> @AtlasMcCoy Electro doesnt use weapons
[4:35:50] <gyrogogozeppeli> see that guy is blue
[4:35:51] <%deviljhojho94> electro is just a jobber because he is fucking stupid
[4:35:55] <EBT93> Fun fact, Electro is voiced by Josh keaton, who also voiced spidey
[4:35:56] <Limes528> Electro in this game is Josh Keaton btw
[4:35:58] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @hoilywood_sn wonder why it’s not like in th ocean here...
[4:35:59] <%deviljhojho94> he is really powerful
[4:36:01] <Thomas100273> Hey! Pat used a gadget!
[4:36:08] <Limes528> @EBT93 Eyy, good timing
[4:36:08] <+GingerTwerk213> There’s a bunch of alien prisoners
[4:36:09] <wunderkonig> @Futurecity10 I know weird right, it's almost as if the security isn't working or has been tampered with.
[4:36:10] <+aslfrasle> !uptime
[4:36:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 36m 12s.
[4:36:13] <Flyrant> a certain someone gave him a new suit
[4:36:15] <AtlasMcCoy> @HoIlywood_SN I mean it looked like he was wearing a mechanical suit
[4:36:15] <%Everpresent_Overseer> How can these unarmed prison convicts even think of taking on Spoorderman?
[4:36:16] <+imextremelymanly> bein stupid makes you a jobber man
[4:36:17] <+fFailureatlife> @Futurecity10 cuz then you dont get to play
[4:36:17] <Lysdexic9541> QUIPS
[4:36:17] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @wunderkonig sounds like a solid idea...
[4:36:17] <%deviljhojho94> fuck
[4:36:18] <%MagickBurritoh> just slap them on the walls when they're tied up
[4:36:18] <TafferAA> duckin LuL
[4:36:19] <Veenok> why dies this Electro's face look so recognizable yet not at the same time?
[4:36:20] <+Meekest> Pat just needs to change his power cause Quips is ResidentSleeper
[4:36:21] <+NeroZeppeli> Kicked that dude right into the fire
[4:36:21] <wsintai> After this is over, all of these prisoners are going to get the chair
[4:36:22] <Mnightshyamallama> man all of these finishers look like they lead straight to death
[4:36:22] <+imextremelymanly> look at JoJo
[4:36:24] <EBT93> @limes528 Great minds think alike
[4:36:24] <thehornypastrypuffer> see YURI knows how to deal with herself compared to MJ
[4:36:25] <circular7> who's the blue guy
[4:36:26] <+koreanbae> Wow first time someone walks away from danger
[4:36:28] <soutakuphi> @angriestpat fun fact electro s played by Josh Keaton aka Peter’s VA for the Spectacular Spider-Man show
[4:36:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @AngriestPat What about the Inmates infected with Titan? When will you unlock those encounters?
[4:36:33] <$ooblagis> Ehy is that dude blue?
[4:36:33] <element_of_loyalty> NO MERCY
[4:36:34] <juncopartner> these prisoners wearing falling skies harnesses
[4:36:35] <Sielas> Is there any Marvel superhero that would just completely invalidate stuff like this, like Superman and Flash would?
[4:36:36] <%Agami23> dead is who he is!
[4:36:37] <+mimikyu92> I like how some of them are inexplicably red
[4:36:40] <+Pat_Squared> but that is fair, I never really bothered to look closer at the scar, thanks for the heads up
[4:36:40] <%ToxInjection> 50 combo PogChamp
[4:36:40] <%deviljhojho94> aliens
[4:36:42] <AlasterAngelo> Yuri also at least has a fucking gun and training
[4:36:45] <%deviljhojho94> RHINO YEAAAAH
[4:36:45] <+fFailureatlife> Mj isnt even this scene can we refrain from shitting on her for a bit
[4:36:46] <+GingerTwerk213> @circular7 probably a kree
[4:36:46] <HoIlywood_SN> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap it gets weirder when you consider traditionally Spider-mans villains go to Ravencroft, a special facility thats still near NYC but just for Spider-Mans villains since they're all weird and fucked up, but they didnt use it for some reason
[4:36:47] <AlasterAngelo> GORE GORE GORE GORE GORE
[4:36:48] <%Afterman_> do humans have any, even small amounts of bioelectricity in them? couldnt electro control that?
[4:36:48] <gyrogogozeppeli> Paul Giamatti
[4:36:48] <%Rostichenburg> There's a story reason why they all get their suits and stuff
[4:36:49] <eaglealden> How does everyone feel about dantes dmc5 theme?
[4:36:49] <+Nomicro4u> oh hi ryno
[4:36:50] <AncelDeLambert> Yuri knows she's accountable when people DIE
[4:36:51] <%shen4u> Sentry probably would
[4:36:52] <lloyddboy> oh hi rhino
[4:36:56] <Austin0097> @EBT93 That's super cool, I think it's real neat how past Spider-Man voice actors come back as side characters in future iterations of the character.
[4:36:57] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @zal_silverfang “where do we put these high-tech weaponry?” “Ehhh, fuckit, just leave it near the doorway...”
[4:36:57] <%SmolBluGhost> oh hai

[4:36:59] <%deviljhojho94> ALL THE WARRIORS

[4:37:11] <TheFilth> I'm so glad I had no idea the Sinister Six were gonna show up when I played
[4:37:11] <%ToxInjection> RUINED
[4:37:12] <Estuko> I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE MESS TAT ONE LOL
[4:37:12] <Warbot40> Why does it feel like this shoudlve happened in the first 3rd of the game.
[4:37:12] <AncelDeLambert> Oh hai Rhino
[4:37:14] <element_of_loyalty> LUL
[4:37:15] <+fFailureatlife> LOOK AT THIS SENTAI VILLAIN
[4:37:16] <%deviljhojho94> SCORPIO YEAAAAAH
[4:37:17] <HoIlywood_SN> @AtlasMcCoy he has innate powers, its probably a booster
[4:37:19] <alcors_wisdom> how is the e3 demo portion the most glitchy
[4:37:21] <wunderkonig> why
[4:37:21] <%SmolBluGhost> wild
[4:37:22] <%SaltyDongs> Spider-sense
[4:37:22] <dekkitout> alien(s) reference?
[4:37:24] <wunderkonig> spidersense
[4:37:24] <thehornypastrypuffer> WHY DOES HE HAVE HIS SUIT
[4:37:27] <AncelDeLambert> Big E3s
[4:37:29] <AtlasMcCoy> After thinking about this situation for a minute. These guys should probably have been executed when they were caught.
[4:37:30] <HoIlywood_SN> Scorpion has no eyes, jesus
[4:37:32] <%Rostichenburg> Shattered Dimensions was the best one for reusing all the Classic voice actors as different Spider-Men
[4:37:32] <+tigerfang86> WHY DO THEY HAVE THE SUITS
[4:37:34] <zal_silverfang> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap yeah. me in just like "bomb team, go. i want it as scrap metal"
[4:37:34] <Veenok> @thehornypastrypuffer just wait
[4:37:35] <gyrogogozeppeli> @al its not a glitch they wanted him to zip
[4:37:38] <$ooblagis> Why did Scorpion explode?
[4:37:38] <%sayaman012341> WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS SPIDER SENSE THEN?
[4:37:39] <Sielas> Scorpion ignores spider sense
[4:37:40] <%Suplex9000> @thehornypastrypuffer Isn't Scorpion bonded to his suit permanently?
[4:37:43] <FunkyRot> holy shit scorpion
[4:37:44] <XdaXcaptainX> BECAUSE ITS BEST SUIT
[4:37:46] <%deviljhojho94> SCORPion ignores it
[4:37:47] <Estuko> @dekkitout if that tail leaving scene didn't settle it, it totally would be an Alien reference
[4:37:47] <Zombrocom> That's three
[4:37:48] <AncelDeLambert> why are the suits just HERE!?
[4:37:49] <gyrogogozeppeli> @alcors_wisdom its not a glitch they wanted him to zip
[4:37:49] <HoIlywood_SN> @tigerfang86 Rhino and Scorpion are surgically attached to theirs
[4:37:49] <Dellago> Alot of these guys are stuck in their suits. Scorpion and Rhino atleast are.
[4:37:50] <+oOZtkOo> spider sense did go off you could see it
[4:37:53] <%deviljhojho94> he was venom before venom was a thing
[4:37:54] <+fFailureatlife> guys calm down about this stuff
[4:37:55] <FunkyRot> he doesnt get enough love
[4:37:55] <%violetheart> It's almost like there's a *reason* they have their suits. ; )
[4:37:56] <Endocrom> So many blue goons
[4:37:57] <%Rostichenburg> Scorpion and Rhino are stuck in their suits
[4:38:00] <+imextremelymanly> all of them have their suit because they can't get out of it. they're stuck in there
[4:38:01] <Tisaric> There's a reason they have the suits
[4:38:01] <+mimikyu92> @tigerfang86 well SOMEONE broke them out. assumedly they also set them up with the good shit
[4:38:02] <Veenok> @sayaman012341 Scorpions naturally hunt spiders. that's why
[4:38:03] <circular7> sinister 6 SeriousSloth MorphinTime EarthDay Mau5 TheTarFu CoolStoryBob
[4:38:04] <Dellago> Like Rhino's main motivation for being a villain is getting out of his suit
[4:38:06] <Dragon_Batman> they tried alil
[4:38:06] <Limes528> His Spider sense is probably going haywire anyways
[4:38:09] <+SolidusRex> @tigerfang86 A certain somebody provided them the suits.
[4:38:10] <AncelDeLambert> @dellago aaah, good point
[4:38:11] <HoIlywood_SN> Scorpion and Rhino are stuck in their outfits, like they'd need special surgery to remove them
[4:38:13] <zal_silverfang> @HoIlywood_SN couldnt you still like.. disarm it?
[4:38:15] <%badchoice5> Thank goodness for these tazer-floors, they save lives
[4:38:24] <%deviljhojho94> they shit in the suits too
[4:38:25] <Veenok> SCORPIONS HUNT SPIDERS THATS WHY HE CANT SENSE HIM GUYS
[4:38:25] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @hoilywood_sn I almost confused Ravencroft for Batman’s Blackgate for a sec...but I remember Ravencroft appeared early in the first Amazing Spider Man tie in game...so there’s that...
[4:38:28] <AlasterAngelo> but where's my boy MYSTERIO IS HE IN THE PIZZA SHOP
[4:38:29] <thehornypastrypuffer> @suplex9000 yeah ok but rhino and electro too?
[4:38:31] <+imextremelymanly> the baby
[4:38:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I guess jungle rot doesn't exist for the guys with bonded suits?
[4:38:35] <%ToxInjection> LUL
[4:38:35] <+Pat_Squared> At least for Electro they explain that its a new suit that Doc gave him
[4:38:40] <%deviljhojho94> mysterio is actually yuri
[4:38:42] <Sielas> face down in the lightning puddle
[4:38:45] <Dellago> Electro's just powdered, like its in his body
[4:38:46] <HoIlywood_SN> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap its basically a knockoff Arkham Asylum so its an understandable mistake
[4:38:47] <%shen4u> Rhinos stuck in his suit, there's an actual reason given real soon
[4:38:49] <%ToxInjection> YEYEYE
[4:38:51] <%SaltyDongs> it is you're really fast
[4:38:55] <wunderkonig> @AlasterAngelo He's probably in sequel limbo right now, with the lizard.
[4:38:58] <%Rostichenburg> Mysterio is probably in regular prison cause he's got no super powers
[4:39:00] <+tigerfang86> WHOA
[4:39:00] <Thomas100273> This is so great.
[4:39:01] <$Mendin> Wait is Electro just the villain from Infamous?
[4:39:01] <Veenok> rhino always shitting his pants
[4:39:02] <%Suplex9000> @thehornypastrypuffer I think Electro's suit keeps him from just frying everything in his vicinity.
[4:39:06] <+Meekest> I like that the difference between Electro and Shocker is that Shocker's a loser and Electro's the real deal
[4:39:16] <Veenok> @mendin that would make him cool tho
[4:39:17] <thehornypastrypuffer> @suplex9000 ooooh alrighty

[4:39:44] <%badchoice5> Vulture looks like he should be stealing children's brains

[4:42:44] <MonsterEnvy> He's the founder
[4:42:44] <dalishprince> elmo cry
[4:42:44] <+RushUnplugged> Ock started the Six
[4:42:45] <%NovaKnightmare> Doc Ock is top tier in Spider Man villains

[4:42:53] <+JenovasPuppet> Yep
[4:42:53] <+tigerfang86> DID IT ON THE FLY
[4:42:56] <vivecdidnothingwrong> SHOCKER
[4:42:56] <+Ell1ot> why does this doc oc hate spider man?
[4:42:57] <Thirtine> bunbeeYeet
[4:42:57] <%Rostichenburg> Should've been Montana
[4:42:57] <%badchoice5> I like that he gives him a warning, presumably for Peter
[4:42:59] <ape_hawk> well, doc ock is known for being a mastermind
[4:43:00] <passionatelust> is pat trying to finish the game today?
[4:43:01] <+fFailureatlife> what
[4:43:01] <cherubsanonymous> OAIGE
[4:43:01] <Flyrant> no, he was planning this
[4:43:02] <BakedBam> this doc oct is so uncool
[4:43:02] <FunkyRot> shooker
[4:43:02] <energywarning> nah just spur of the moment
[4:43:02] <+fFailureatlife> paige
[4:43:03] <pectusumbra> He's been crazy inventive for the whole game
[4:43:04] <alcors_wisdom> man that suit looks so goofy in this context
[4:43:04] <vivecdidnothingwrong> YOU CANT ESCAPE ME
[4:43:05] <+mechslayer71> @shraquet it was edited. The part where he says “you” didn’t actually happen
[4:43:05] <Flyrant> you see hints in the lab
[4:43:07] <+SilasDrekken> he had a map of the prison in his lab like the whole game @AngriestPat
[4:43:10] <%Afterman_> at this point we dont know if he was planning it or not
[4:43:10] <lemon_lore> 8hands
[4:43:10] <%deviljhojho94> SIX SIX SIX
[4:43:10] <+Meekest> Naw he was planning this
[4:43:10] <%Freelance7> HE MADE A NEW SUIT IN A NIGHT
[4:43:11] <AlasterAngelo> AVENGERS ASSEMBLE
[4:43:12] <%PipIV> I forgot about montana
[4:43:12] <wunderkonig> Well he built those arms in what, 3 days?
[4:43:12] <%Afterman_> jsut listen to the lore
[4:43:13] <circular7> this is too sudden
[4:43:13] <element_of_loyalty> PUR
[4:43:14] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat maybe it was AIM who was planning it all?
[4:43:14] <+Arkfyre> There's clues about him doing a special contract for thr Raft earlier in the game.
[4:43:15] <+BaronEgo> just wait
[4:43:16] <vivecdidnothingwrong> I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
[4:43:17] <+JenovasPuppet> He had big plans. That bit with turning off his implant was just for show.
[4:43:17] <Shraquet> @mechslayer71 Was it supposed to be anyone?
[4:43:17] <Estuko> I appreciate them making us think Negative Man was the big final bad
[4:43:17] <+Nomicro4u> Elmo flop
[4:43:19] <Archmortal> I wonder what all those contracts he had were for.
[4:43:19] <+Pat_Squared> its implied that he's been kinda working on this for a bit
[4:43:20] <+SuichiTanaka> He's been planning this, subconsciously or not
[4:43:20] <+imextremelymanly> he was building it under your nose the whole time
[4:43:22] <+walternatorz> super tentacle arms are super efficient
[4:43:23] <sirjonston> if you were looking at the lab room, you would have noticed him making plans for 'contractor job' at the island
[4:43:23] <Limes528> Go back to the lab. There's lore
[4:43:23] <%deviljhojho94> Fuck these guys
[4:43:25] <%Rostichenburg> Go back to the Lab for more foreshadowing
[4:43:26] <%DedlokPM> @Ell1ot In this case only because he is in the way right now. Plus affected by mind interface thingie
[4:43:27] <Rowan_Atkinsonn> They explain in a bit
[4:43:27] <Thomas100273> He was planning it since he hooked up with A.I.M.
[4:43:28] <ShmowzowKapow> oh boy
[4:43:29] <EBT93> He was probably planning ot for a while
[4:43:29] <vbanej> earlier. Was making a bunch of prototype Weaponry for a mon contract
[4:43:29] <XdaXcaptainX> YET
[4:43:30] <Dragon_Batman> if you go to his lab there is more lore about it
[4:43:31] <dalishprince> yet 👀
[4:43:31] <juncopartner> @Pat_Squared they're jumping him in to their gang
[4:43:31] <+Pat_Squared> likely since he started getting stuff from AIM
[4:43:32] <%badchoice5> HE MADE ELECTRO A NEW SUIT! WITH A PILE OF SCRAPS!
[4:43:32] <element_of_loyalty> JUINX
[4:43:33] <Shraquet> I know it doens't happen in the final game but
[4:43:34] <dekkitout> no but seriously, the government would send in the avengers
[4:43:35] <jack_s1n> planning from almost the start of the game
[4:43:35] <$magikestral> how do you like Arkham Knight, Pat @angriestpat
[4:43:35] <Veenok> DO YIU NOT REMEMBER THE MILITARY CONTRACTS? THAT WAS THE SUITS
[4:43:36] <%violetheart> @AngriestPat Remember that Doc Oc was doing military contracts and even working on the security of the raft to make money to support his more recent experiments. He's been dabbling in this for a while now.
[4:43:36] <hyphenated_q> He was bad since before the terrorist attack
[4:43:37] <Sielas> ADAM
[4:43:37] <Shraquet> doesn't
[4:43:38] <+mimikyu92> how does he have such good publicity?
[4:43:40] <%Spydurman> Li
[4:43:40] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> OH FUCK NOT TIMES SQUARE
[4:43:40] <sirjonston> through several points in the game
[4:43:41] <Jaxnos> yeah, you saw the plans for the Raft. and the special armor plating. and his doc ock suit before the tentacles
[4:43:42] <TheFilth> he was helping design the Raft's defences, with his turn he had a massive insight to fuck things up
[4:43:42] <Tearonex> this is not too sudden there are plenty of hints at him becoming Doc Ock
[4:43:42] <Endocrom> Neat screen effect
[4:43:43] <%deviljhojho94> DOC DOC DOC
[4:43:45] <+Neryl_> Didn't he have a map of the raft like, super early on? He's probably been planning it for a while. @AngriestPat
[4:43:45] <+DAIROCKETTO> @AngriestPat sinister six happened before gg in the comics lol
[4:43:45] <VentusHero> this fucking scene
[4:43:48] <%ThatRandomGuy661> He was contracted to do security stuff earlier
[4:43:50] <%Superstarsage> Nooooooooo

[4:46:59] <+CaptainJax> just call in mephisto have him cure aunt may in exchange for spidey's relationship with bitchlord MJ
[4:47:00] <+FrostMass22> First we attack his heart!
[4:47:01] <Prism_Wing> Honestly, trying to become a superman IS a crazy thing to do.
[4:47:01] <+fFailureatlife> Spider-man is a bad ass
[4:47:03] <yendoria> Hey how did he not die from Scrpion STABBING HIM IN THE SPINE
[4:47:03] <CrimsonGargoyle> WAIT. IF THE DOCTORS LOOKED AT HIM THEN THEY KNOW IT'S PETER, RIGHT?

[4:47:10] <Endocrom> Where were the Avengers while New York was getting gassed?
[4:47:11] <+walternatorz> it's just new york in the 80's
[4:47:12] <$magikestral> we're arkham now, complete with red laser snipers
[4:47:14] <+fFailureatlife> @AlasterAngelo because yuri doesnt know peter
[4:47:18] <%violetheart> It's kind of nice. They're all people with noble goals but become twisted by personal interests, selfishness, or madness. Makes them feel human but covered in super goo, rather than weird freakazoids with no personality other than evil.
[4:47:19] <AtlasMcCoy> Literally caused the end of the world to spite a single man
[4:47:19] <XdaXcaptainX> skill points?.....

[4:47:26] <$Mendin> Remember when Pat thought everything escalated when they bombed the police ceremony?
[4:47:28] <%Rostichenburg> Now it's time for Last Stand Spidey to be dramatic
[4:47:30] <AncelDeLambert> Private mercenaries in a city is a GREAT idea!
[4:47:30] <%NovaKnightmare> Man, Spidey needs a car with tazers built into it

[4:48:09] <CrimsonGargoyle> @mimikyu92 that's awfully convenient LUL
[4:48:10] <%MagickBurritoh> could this red mist be the MERCER VIRUS?

[4:48:52] <%Afterman_> i mean they said how long it took for all of those mice to die
[4:48:53] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Godammit, Sable
[4:48:53] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat Wait, if New York GOT THIS BAD then SURELY the Avengers would come back RIGHT AWAY?
[4:48:54] <Neo_Kaiser> and when Spider-Man completes them, they become Dis-Sable Crimes.
[4:48:58] <alcors_wisdom> @Mendin im talking marines most likely a naval blockade probs urban warfare units not PMC's in fact osborn would be ousted immediately for hiring a PMC to police the city

[4:50:32] <%deviljhojho94> there is literally no way spiderman hasnt killed at least one dude. He truly is like kiryu
[4:50:33] <Thomas100273> The first patch of this game made it that when you kicked a guy off of a roof instead of falling to their death they get webbed to a wall, no matter how ridiculous it looks.
[4:50:41] <%Rostichenburg> I've had so many people stuck in walls it' the worst
[4:50:43] <%badchoice5> Tazed his neck pretty hard there Peter...

[4:51:46] <Austin0097> Am I the only one who thinks the concussive blast feels like the most lethal weapon in this game?
[4:51:47] <%deviljhojho94> big boy go apatBig DOWN
[4:51:48] <Lysdexic9541> So much death
[4:51:51] <%Afterman_> the white 2099 is so beautiful
[4:51:52] <juncopartner> you know if the gangs would stay inside rather than standing on roofs they'd escape spidermans notice a lot easier
[4:51:53] <+GingerTwerk213> @estuko 2099 white
[4:51:56] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @estuko I was wondering why Hollywood’s name wasn’t showing up in the list when I put in th first four letters...
[4:51:58] <BakedBam> guys they get webbed to the wall, not fall to the ground
[4:51:59] <%Rostichenburg> I used concussive blast to launch a dude like two blocks but he landed on a roof so he didn't die
[4:52:02] <wunderkonig> Oh Pat you know what's fun? If you jump off the side of a building, you can just pull them off the side with triangle
[4:52:04] <%Everpresent_Overseer> dead
[4:52:07] <element_of_loyalty> MEOW
[4:52:08] <alcors_wisdom> remember 14 broken bones

[4:52:11] <EBT93> @estuko Tie between Big Time, Last Stand and Punk

[4:52:14] <Estuko> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap same, fucked my head lol
[4:52:15] <TheMilhouseExperience> At this point just give Spider-Man a gun.
[4:52:16] <%violetheart> actually burnign alive
[4:52:21] <pillowwasp> Punisher must be having a fun time
[4:52:21] <Clu_Flynn> Spiderman, 57 confirmed kills

[4:52:35] <+fFailureatlife> Kappa
[4:52:35] <grayjammer> Beasts all over the shop...
[4:52:37] <%badchoice5> Spiderman demands more blood
[4:52:41] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @estuko we siivagunner now
[4:52:43] <wunderkonig> that ability that lets you web pull enemies in the air can also be used to pull them off roofs
[4:52:44] <%badchoice5> BLOOD FOR THE SPIDER-GOD
[4:52:45] <Celanes> Oh god this is Punishers wet dream
[4:52:46] <Endocrom> You know what? Forget the Avengers, where's Punisher during this? He'd be like a kid in a murder store.
[4:52:46] <$RaikenTB> @pillowwasp Frank would be in heaven during this.
[4:52:50] <%deviljhojho94> they work pretty fast, this took like 24 hours

[4:53:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Daxalog Like goons? Cuz there was Screwball, though I think she just gave up
[4:53:07] <Flyrant> Paige confirmed to build make shift gang hideouts
[4:53:10] <hyphenated_q> Tying someone up to a fire barrel is torture, then death
[4:53:13] <+baseball7000> AIR YANK, PLS.
[4:53:13] <%Rostichenburg> Blood Spider is a real character
[4:53:14] <Daxalog> Ah
[4:53:14] <+Vardek13> Dayum hurricanrana?
[4:53:21] <%Agami23> remember when spiderman punched a women in half, and his excuse was "i thought it was wolverine"?
[4:53:23] <+mimikyu92> I want the punisher to be in a sidequest as a boss fight. Spidey needs to stop Frank Castle from torturing all these convicts to death
[4:53:24] <$RaikenTB> Rikers can hold up to 15,000 apparently.
[4:53:24] <%Everpresent_Overseer> spider god demands more tribute! Kill them all Peter!
[4:53:25] <AlasterAngelo> that guy doesnt give a fuck

[4:54:05] <Thomas100273> Spider-Man does have a healing ability in recent years. I guess that extends to broken bones.

[5:03:20] <$MightyMaxT> Nah, Plague is Pat 2020
[5:03:22] <wunderkonig> Plague is the scarlet Spider of the pat verse.
[5:03:22] <$Mendin> I almost misread that to hear that Max was playing drunk Third Birthday

[5:03:42] <%Rostichenburg> Pat is Negative Zone Paige
[5:03:47] <Flyrant> Scarlet Spider best spider
[5:03:55] <Veenok> you're damn right
[5:03:57] <wunderkonig> Mat is obviously just punisher
[5:03:59] <hntronium> CATGIRLS
[5:04:00] <Estuko> LUL
[5:04:16] <Estuko> They actually WON lmao
[5:04:17] <Veenok> also he made a BADASS SUIT
[5:04:23] <Clu_Flynn> Scarlet Witch best Spider
[5:04:24] <+Nomicro4u> scorpion actually used his stinger for once
[5:04:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yeah, beat him off
[5:04:26] <+Skwizgarr> Felinids are heresy pvpS
[5:04:27] <wunderkonig> Now would that make Woolie Steel, or Daredevil because he's blind?
[5:04:27] <Austin0097> They just kicked him some.
[5:04:28] <%badchoice5> I liked the part where they sabbed him
[5:04:34] <mtgtin> DID NOT FINISH
[5:04:34] <Dragon_Batman> It's really good
[5:04:35] <Austin0097> THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL!
[5:04:37] <AlasterAngelo> it actually didn't finish
[5:04:38] <Twoiis> It didn't finish.
[5:04:41] <AlasterAngelo> that's the tragedy
[5:04:41] <%Ferakin> THEY DIDN'T FINISH IT AT ALL
[5:04:41] <%Caidezes> Spectacular Spider-Man is great.
[5:04:43] <Endocrom> It should turn into a Telltale game where you trick the Sinister Six into turning on each other with dialog options.
[5:04:44] <%bloodypurpledog> Is that the Drake Bell one
[5:04:45] <%Ferakin> It got SUPER cancelled
[5:04:46] <marvel877> It did not finish, it got canned.
[5:04:46] <%Rostichenburg> It didn't finish at all
[5:04:48] <+SuichiTanaka> Spectacular Spider-man is great
[5:04:48] <MonsterEnvy> It didn't finish at all
[5:04:49] <%Slaardacity> it didnt finish
[5:04:54] <Veenok> @wunderkonig hes Luke cage but he doesnt like coffee
[5:04:55] <Austin0097> It actually kind of anti-finished.
[5:04:57] <Lysdexic9541> @bloodypurpledog Yep
[5:04:59] <Zantetzuken> rip telltale games
[5:05:01] <%Slaardacity> cliffhanging like a mf
[5:05:03] <SunsetJack> Spectacular Spider-man has a great opening.
[5:05:05] <mercado94> Spectacular is ... Well spectacular
[5:05:09] <Dragon_Batman> That artist is dope
[5:05:17] <+imextremelymanly> long before
[5:05:28] <wunderkonig> @Veenok which makes Liam Iron fist and super bunny hop JJJ.
[5:05:30] <zal_silverfang> paige was right. he was planning up
[5:05:35] <rytisone> just like he didnt get peter is spidey
[5:05:37] <%ThatRandomGuy661> He was though
[5:05:39] <Tearonex> @AngriestPat It did not finish, it cancelled during the Disney buy out
[5:05:40] <element_of_loyalty> HAT
[5:05:42] <AlasterAngelo> SHOCKEERRRRRR
[5:05:46] <Flyrant> shocker uses seismic power
[5:05:48] <AlasterAngelo> I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTTHHHHH
[5:05:49] <%bloodypurpledog> Lightning and earthquake
[5:06:03] <wunderkonig> lightning and thunder
[5:06:05] <Veenok> hes a human phone charger
[5:06:09] <Dragon_Batman> It's not electrical
[5:06:13] <mtgtin> NOT AWESOME
[5:06:13] <Nova712> more like a sonic wave
[5:06:14] <Austin0097> He's a guy with two giant vibrators attached to each arm.
[5:06:18] <+imextremelymanly> no matter how good
[5:06:21] <Zombrocom> So telltale went bankrupt? Rough
[5:06:21] <Veenok> and shocker is a Human Hitachi
[5:06:22] <rytisone> just like Walking Dead
[5:06:26] <AlasterAngelo> @Austin0097 shit he's like double Nero
[5:06:31] <Cnoir_Ultimo> Mysterio though
[5:06:32] <wunderkonig> Yes so one is lightning the other is thunder
[5:06:34] <%Rostichenburg> Ultimate finished it was just lame
[5:06:39] <+aslfrasle> Anyone who thinks Electro is cooler than Shocker is essentially saying Eneru is cooler than Whitebeard, which is insane and wrong.
[5:06:45] <Neo_Kaiser> The Sam Raimi movies finished.
[5:06:48] <element_of_loyalty> SPAWN
[5:06:49] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Shocker has a better track record than almost all of Spider-Mans villains and nobody acknowledges it
