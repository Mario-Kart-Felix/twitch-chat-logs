[0:04:41] <BluffRainbow> Yay the ginger hobbe goblin is on
[0:04:43] <Profmcstevie> But why would I need 7 Aircraft Carriers
[0:04:50] <%YakumoYomi> PS5 looks like it has a weak launch lineup, so I would go with Cyberpunk. That said, I play on PC and Switch primarily.
[0:04:59] <%Saltmeisterr> @tizz86 who is that?

[0:08:09] <+oda_flobunaga> I got a PS2 after 2 years into the PS3 lifespan
[0:08:17] <%YakumoYomi> Personally, I don't feel it's ever worth getting a console at launch. The library of exclusives is weak, you have to deal with shortages, and you might have to deal with defects

[0:33:53] <penitentpentwitch> Level 3.0 Cheerleaders suck. And are the main reason I keep an ability that converts enemies, since that status effect pierces shields.
[0:33:59] <Tisaric> only intermittently shields itself
[0:34:05] <%superc37> @filialpails well yeah, thats what happened

[0:34:58] <heartlesshealer> don't let it set in
[0:35:04] <%koolaid_kevster> SUPERHOTT
[0:35:07] <Vashido22> @patstaresat starting pyre today?
[0:35:09] <heartlesshealer> Also congrats to your dad on battling cancer!
[0:35:24] <Tisaric> he probably won't have time to get to pyre
[0:35:35] <Vashido22> aww
[0:35:36] <penitentpentwitch> And now my favorite version of Flood, as a Passive!
[0:35:39] <Tisaric> there's still a decent chunk left
[0:35:51] <TheZearGuy> It’s only been 30 minutes. Gameplay already? Damn you Warframe.
[0:36:02] <%superc37> eeeeehh hes still got at least 2-3 hours left of this game so i doubt he'll be able to do pyre today
[0:36:06] <heartlesshealer> he looked too far into it in his spare time
[0:36:20] <heartlesshealer> (the guy, not Pat)
[0:36:36] <Vashido22> I really forgot a lot of this game's end part, except for the ending itself
[0:36:41] <heartlesshealer> puppy <3
[0:36:42] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I googled Chihuahua/Bulldog mixes and they look as hilarious as you'd think. Chihuahuas with bulldog faces to was looks like stubby legged Boxers. And someone of them are really ripped, the clook like brick shithouses
[0:36:45] <Vashido22> I remember it being way shorter

[1:05:53] <+LandOfTheWay> "I'm drunk! You don't have an excuse!"
[1:06:13] <+kalyxchews> they're geckos
[1:06:24] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:06:25] <+Toblo1> So... they're scounting units?

[1:07:55] <reonome> ITS A BOMB
[1:07:57] <OToole42> song
[1:07:57] <Daxalog> Hes losing it
[1:07:59] <%sirisvirus> I think its the game
[1:07:59] <+LandOfTheWay> song's been processed
[1:08:00] <+irisillych> that was the game
[1:08:00] <+scrumbotime> My thought as to why they might not like water, everything else is Solid and can be easily converted, but the water is many many fluctuating things and probably is harder to laser into cubes
[1:08:08] <filialpails> 2^24 + 4
[1:08:13] <%Fooguwu> OwO
[1:08:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Lewd

[1:08:49] <SaltyAzteca> Ballsy Pat
[1:08:59] <%Saltmeisterr> what part of the process ecosystem is the spine supposed to do
[1:09:12] <$RealThiele> Weed must be protected
[1:09:31] <user_naim> Does the spine become big structures or something?
[1:10:08] <user_naim> I remember so little
[1:10:09] <%superc37> nah its just really big
[1:10:55] <+oda_flobunaga> The spine is just a giant sky dildo
[1:11:02] <%Saltmeisterr> maybe it exist to not serve a function like the Men
[1:11:05] <+barrakuta371> I reloaded the stream, and I was able to hear pat say"Gotcha bit- Gotcha bitch" Nothing of note really, just thought it was funny.
[1:11:09] <$Dakuu75> Kono-suba~ I love that show
[1:11:20] <%BubbaRands> You mean red aqua?

[1:11:49] <applespearsoranges> AFAIK spines have 2 interpretations
[1:11:54] <mdkcde> Yep
[1:12:05] <mdkcde> It's just red useless mode aqua
[1:12:16] <PanicSwytch> oh shit Pat went straight to playing
[1:12:20] <applespearsoranges> it could be literal 'spine of the world' as in they are the foundation of the city
[1:12:25] <mdkcde> the most funny face aqua ever made
[1:12:30] <applespearsoranges> or they are animated buildings
[1:12:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> BORK BUSTED

[1:23:53] <%DedlokPM> Oh wait, not it's bigest load to smallest load
[1:23:56] <%DedlokPM> never mind
[1:24:10] <$Mekhet09> Is it random what skills you get?
[1:24:26] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[1:24:29] <Tisaric> not random it's based on the challenge
[1:24:36] <%superc37> @mekhet09 for the challenge? no
[1:24:38] <jfp4life> Jaunt during Turn you fool
[1:24:39] <%Saltmeisterr> @dalmek yeah i just booted up transistor to find out lol
[1:24:44] <%Saltmeisterr> its bounce
[1:24:47] <SaltyAzteca> Jaunt, never run, saves more space for other attacks
[1:24:57] <%DedlokPM> @heartlesshealer IIRC it will be his B move that goes next. It's the one that has the mark connected to the life bar
[1:25:18] <heartlesshealer> thanks dedlok, forgot about the lines
[1:25:24] <Tisaric> yeah the yellow highlight on the button is the next to get yeeted
[1:25:30] <$RealThiele> thats what she said
[1:25:30] <heartlesshealer> looks like the attack will be the last one pat loses
[1:25:35] <%DedlokPM> @heartlesshealer now the A vutton is next. think that is the dash
[1:25:45] <+the_drummaestro> that humming is beautiful
[1:26:05] <ape_hawk> thanks, sword boyfriend
[1:26:08] <heartlesshealer> @DedlokPM Yeah, thanks for the reminder on the prediction mechanic
[1:26:36] <SaltyAzteca> "Thatd be hot" LUL
[1:26:37] <ape_hawk> what if he became a robot toilet?!?!?
[1:26:40] <penitentpentwitch> Something Something Sheath Joke
[1:26:42] <$RealThiele> but what if he was a robot donkey sword
[1:26:42] <%AzureGale> Sex would be hard tho
[1:26:44] <cherrycottontail> better than robot toilet
[1:26:53] <+kalyxchews> most husbands would be better in sword form
[1:26:57] <AMUSERNAME> Get + Friend PogChamp
[1:26:59] <$Dakuu75> *sigh* this is a typical conversation here. And i'm not surprised
[1:27:02] <$RealThiele> he can get that void
[1:27:04] <devanmuse> there are a lot of ways to have sex if you have an open mind
[1:27:05] <heartlesshealer> Hilts never go soft
[1:27:06] <cherrycottontail> nah man just make the hilt a dildo
[1:27:06] <%trustycoyote> My wife said I can't become a robot so I think robot sword is out of the question
[1:27:09] <hot_take_jake> multi-vibrate settings
[1:27:11] <jfp4life> Maybe put Load on Jaunt?
[1:27:11] <filialpails> how many settings?
[1:27:12] <+Promessa_EX> you would have to change size.... unless...
[1:27:12] <Tisaric> just use the dead bodies in the sword with you to shoot beams and shit
[1:27:12] <%DappercatEsquire> women love when their marital aids do laser light shows
[1:27:14] <SaltyAzteca> Knee slapper!
[1:27:14] <heartlesshealer> damn
[1:27:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> The transistor's probably too heavy for Paige to safely lift.

[1:51:42] <Daxalog> Remember to turn that limiter off
[1:51:52] <$RealThiele> some of you will die, but its a sacrifice hes willing to make
[1:52:17] <%Aeoneth> Pat limiter
[1:52:50] <+kalyxchews> Eldritch Math
[1:52:50] <+lordericter> you impossible space right pat

[1:52:54] <PatchySouls> times sure are trying :\
[1:52:57] <%AzureGale> It's all fucked
[1:52:59] <%Saltmeisterr> NON EUCLIDIAN SPACE BABY
[1:53:00] <+rottingpastry> noneuclidean space omg
[1:53:07] <+razielhex> *sighs* Times are Tough...

[1:53:18] <+Toblo1> Uh OH.
[1:53:20] <dukenux> yeeea
[1:53:24] <filialpails> you, me, and the transistor makes three
[1:53:24] <%superc37> i don't think they can
[1:53:24] <dukenux> Escher up in here
[1:53:24] <$joylent_blue> my head NotLikeThis
[1:53:28] <%za7az> Isn't literally everyone but Red and him dead?
[1:53:29] <%AzureGale> lololololololololololololol
[1:53:30] <dukenux> no shit
[1:53:33] <SaltyAzteca> fux wit ya maiiind
[1:53:33] <%ArchimerCXV> boy they really nailed giving him that annoying George Lucas persona
[1:53:41] <%superc37> cuz red was only *partially* integrated
[1:53:41] <ape_hawk> no, dipshit, when everything changes, everything changes
[1:53:44] <+rottingpastry> That's a dumb statement.
[1:53:53] <s0lesurviv0r> MC Escher time baybee!
[1:53:54] <lol_red_ranger> no, nothing changes
[1:53:55] <+kalyxchews> We May Have Gone Too Far In Some Places
[1:53:57] <heartlesshealer> go to (grid numbers)
[1:54:08] <$RealThiele> imagamedevandthisisdeep
[1:54:24] <SaltyAzteca> lucky
[1:54:30] <LoneFonte> shooty LUL
[1:54:40] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[1:54:47] <%superc37> i mean its more about the lack of a foundation rather than anything else
[1:55:07] <filialpails> what is a man? a miserable little pile of haircuts!
[1:55:08] <PatchySouls> ew
[1:55:21] <+oda_flobunaga> The coronavirus is just doing a job, its job.
[1:55:24] <Finchit> I love this guy
[1:55:27] <PatchySouls> damn he's blaming the dead guy :O
[1:55:28] <%superc37> its the same sort of idea as "if it aint broke dont fix it"
[1:55:41] <%ArchimerCXV> this guy's such a believable PoS
[1:55:42] <$RealThiele> "traditional sense" dafaq
[1:55:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Ya think?
[1:55:42] <PatchySouls> in the traditional sense, mhmmm
[1:55:43] <$joylent_blue> was it now pvpStory
[1:55:43] <+lordericter> I mean grant reprogrammed a construction robot to build over everything essentially
[1:55:45] <+oda_flobunaga> Well, at least you admit it?
[1:55:46] <ape_hawk> "I didnt think the world-eating virus would eat me!" - man who invented world-eating virus
[1:55:50] <OvaltineDream> wrong in the contemporary sense LUL
[1:55:52] <+LandOfTheWay> that... sure is one way to put it, royce
[1:55:57] <%za7az> YOU THINK?
[1:56:06] <+oda_flobunaga> THE GREATER GOOD
[1:56:09] <$RealThiele> Alternative correctness
[1:56:20] <+Toblo1> Ya think pissing off a computer virus was a good idea?
[1:56:51] <heartlesshealer> summoned D-Reaper
[1:56:58] <%superc37> so royce doesnt even know what the fuck the process's deal is either, or why they exist
[1:57:17] <Daxalog> They share types. So one is a healing one. One is invis...
[1:57:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> Just wait for more dialogue
[1:57:27] <%superc37> it isnt even a virus, its more like a system restart
[1:57:28] <$dalmek> I like the idea that the "Man-Process" gets stronger the more they are
[1:57:36] <+LandOfTheWay> honestly, the issue with the process here is basically the issue with the drones in ac7
[1:57:38] <+pectusumbra> so its slivers
[1:57:38] <$dalmek> like a sort of weird version of community
[1:57:40] <AMUSERNAME> SourPls
[1:57:42] <PatchySouls> weeee also this art is beautifulk
[1:57:46] <$joylent_blue> bf sword GivePLZ
[1:57:48] <LoneFonte> love this shot
[1:57:48] <$RealThiele> he killed me mal
[1:57:51] <TigerClaws12> AngelThump
[1:57:53] <%Saltmeisterr> it still amazes me that SGG brought back man passives in hades
[1:57:53] <+lordericter> you can even be a sword
[1:57:59] <arkv01> uh okay, bye dildo sword
[1:57:59] <PatchySouls> this song SourPls
[1:58:00] <%Sycada> USB-KUN
[1:58:01] <+oda_flobunaga> the old Paige splash art
[1:58:04] <+rottingpastry> No phallic imagery here, nosiree
[1:58:05] <heartlesshealer> he wanted to be held by Red
[1:58:08] <+SodiumPatrol> BibleThump
[1:58:13] <%Saltmeisterr> although the exalted are just process
[1:58:16] <DominoAxiom> Man, she really likes that sword
[1:58:17] <+Jaysky> My Boyfriend Is A Moonlight Greatsword!
[1:58:17] <dukenux> Kappa
[1:58:17] <+kalyxchews> some DMC final area shit
[1:58:28] <$joylent_blue> USB-kun LUL fuckin' chat
[1:58:29] <PatchySouls> man shut up Royce
[1:58:36] <AMUSERNAME> @Jaysky LUL
[1:58:37] <+Toblo1> So... is that why she's able to hear Mr Nobody?
[1:58:46] <%TheWinged7> i seeee the spiiiiiine of the woooooorld
[1:58:52] <arkv01> just a bit father he says and then he cooms first PunOko
[1:58:56] <SaltyAzteca> Ladies and gents. Here we are.
[1:59:08] <%Saltmeisterr> they recorded their info eariler before they died
[1:59:11] <$RealThiele> many men
[1:59:13] <%superc37> @patstaresat thats bc grant and asher recorded themselves BEFORE dying.
[1:59:19] <+kalyxchews> BIG damage
[1:59:20] <+LandOfTheWay> @toblo1 yep, that's why he's the only one she can talk to
[1:59:24] <SaltyAzteca> Surprise Buttsex!
[1:59:34] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Now's a good time to optimize your moveset, get what you really want in there
[1:59:38] <hawkhollywood> think so too especially since he keeps stuttering and repeating himself
[1:59:39] <dukenux> those men are weirdly inactive. i remember them being more aggresive
[1:59:56] <+Jaysky> I think it's cause Pat stealths
[1:59:57] <+rottingpastry> baleeted
[1:59:58] <heartlesshealer> terminal
[2:00:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> So the process has ALWAYS BEEN HERE
[2:00:38] <jfp4life> you can scroll that text
[2:00:42] <$RealThiele> ok pal
[2:00:45] <penitentpentwitch> The Machine behind the Power
[2:00:46] <PatchySouls> so he fucked things up so he could get recognition
[2:00:48] <+Toblo1> The Process were the maintance machines.
[2:00:54] <+LandOfTheWay> so yes, the process are literally just the background software of Cloudbank
[2:00:56] <+oda_flobunaga> the process is just the way by which the Matrix they are in changes
[2:00:59] <%Mendin> The city-reshaping Consensus Reality... incarnate
[2:01:00] <+kalyxchews> this world is built on the process
[2:01:01] <+Jaysky> Ya think?
[2:01:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt The process is a PROCESSOR the city is code
[2:01:04] <$RealThiele> the Faro plague started
[2:01:07] <+LandOfTheWay> and now they're stuck on Factory Reset
[2:01:12] <+Toblo1> The literal backbone of the world.
[2:01:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its compiling code
[2:01:17] <+lordericter> the process is linked to the OVC terminals, whenever a change is voted on it enacts that
[2:01:23] <+oda_flobunaga> the city is a cyber/Matrix reality
[2:01:23] <%RyTYoung> hey they said the thing
[2:01:25] <%toastybites> they're reseting everything
[2:01:27] <heartlesshealer> Depth: NAN
[2:01:28] <AMUSERNAME> NAN LUL
[2:01:28] <LoneFonte> NaN
[2:01:30] <%laserbeaming> It's like they're living in a weird thought experiment
[2:01:33] <penitentpentwitch> If you take the idea that this whole city is a Virtual Construct. This is basically a computer reformatting.
[2:01:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Depth Not a Number
[2:01:39] <filialpails> not a number
[2:01:41] <aeonicvector> The Process is the processor the cities code, its the spine of their world :)
[2:01:46] <DominoAxiom> “War doesn’t change things. Only change does that.”
[2:01:53] <$RealThiele> what happens if some idiot deltree*.* the matrix
[2:01:58] <Make_me_mad> This is Reboot.
[2:02:00] <heartlesshealer> not a number is a good depth to see
[2:02:00] <dukenux> Yeah, my idea too
[2:02:01] <arkv01> hey kid
[2:02:05] <dukenux> this is a VR city
[2:02:06] <arkv01> im a coompooter
[2:02:14] <%RyTYoung> The Oldest Town?
[2:02:15] <%CrookedSpiral> Is this a TRON?
[2:02:20] <PatchySouls> I mean, transistor IS a programming term
[2:02:22] <%kyh9> Yeah, it’s basically a Tron World
[2:02:23] <+Jaysky> When do we get the big cliffhanger with Megabyte?
[2:02:24] <+razielhex> the final boss of transistor is Gawr Gura
[2:02:26] <dukenux> kinda
[2:02:26] <+razielhex> Shaaaaaark
[2:02:28] <%DappercatEsquire> so did he want to democratize all of reality or...?
[2:02:33] <geminibread> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:02:34] <LoneFonte> is...is this a VR Chat room?
[2:02:36] <+Toblo1> When Everything Changes, Nothing Changes.
[2:02:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> So the Camerata didn't like that their existence was ephemeral and sought to make it more rigid.
[2:02:41] <%kyh9> You’re basically inside The Grid from Tron Legacy
[2:02:44] <OvaltineDream> s t a s i s
[2:02:48] <%Mendin> it already -was-, @DappercatEsquire
[2:02:49] <TigerClaws12> VR Chat lobby PogChamp
[2:02:49] <%YakumoYomi> Shaaaaark
[2:02:51] <Finchit> Holyshit CLOUDbank. it is a computer
[2:02:52] <+razielhex> Ugandan Knuckles racing across the grid
[2:02:54] <%Mendin> And everyone was to ofickle
[2:03:00] <T_Sasquatch> your sword literally absorbs people
[2:03:03] <Make_me_mad> His problem is that reality was already democratized. Everything was up to vote and things changed based on what people voted any given day.
[2:03:06] <Make_me_mad> They wanted stability.
[2:03:09] <aeonicvector> God i love this part of the game
[2:03:13] <+LandOfTheWay> @dappercatesquire the exact camerata plan is unclear, but basically they wanted things to be less ephemeral
[2:03:18] <%laserbeaming> Shooty Men
[2:03:20] <CrematedCube> Whether it's in meatspace or not, this entire place is all virtual
[2:03:20] <+kalyxchews> they were living in an automated world and got tired of it, but ended up royally fucking it up instead
[2:03:20] <DominoAxiom> If you don’t believe in change, you don’t believe in time
[2:03:23] <%kyh9> This game is basically Tron Legacy
[2:03:26] <+Toblo1> @Daniel_Is_I Thats why they were targeting people with "talent" via the Transistor. I think.
[2:03:34] <%kyh9> Tron Legacy 2: now with swords
[2:03:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do you?
[2:03:36] <%DappercatEsquire> gotcha, thanks folks
[2:03:42] <penitentpentwitch> "So we realized we were in the Matrix and tried to hack it to have absolute control to bypass the voting method. That may have been a terrible idea."
[2:03:43] <%kyh9> TRONsistor
[2:03:44] <$joylent_blue> pat's got this you guys
[2:03:45] <heartlesshealer> yeah, good combinations you got going so far
[2:03:45] <Vashido22> yup
[2:03:48] <%Saltmeisterr> left
[2:03:51] <%za7az> LUL
[2:03:52] <%Saltmeisterr> go left
[2:03:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> Royce's trace lore mentions how his work would always fade and people didn't like when he tried to make his work more rigid.
[2:03:53] <%laserbeaming> Mask() might be a tiny bit too powerful
[2:03:56] <Vashido22> pat got the combo
[2:04:05] <penitentpentwitch> NW lore, NE progress
[2:04:06] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck yea he got CULL LUL
[2:04:11] <%Daniel_Is_I> In the current 100% democratic society, Royce's view would never be recognized.
[2:04:19] <hot_take_jake> I don't like computer Mr Rogers
[2:04:20] <T_Sasquatch> CULL X 24
[2:04:22] <%RyTYoung> Chat how far is Pat into Transistor? I've not played all the way through it myself
[2:04:23] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[2:04:27] <dukenux> Of course
[2:04:30] <Finchit> a very meek man
[2:04:34] <%TheWinged7> well... there it is
[2:04:35] <+LandOfTheWay> KIND OF
[2:04:36] <hot_take_jake> almost the end
[2:04:37] <+Erimos> Sounds like Owen Wilson to me
[2:04:38] <@CreepyPorpoise> I love this game
[2:04:38] <+oda_flobunaga> Geff Joldblum
[2:04:41] <@CreepyPorpoise> I crei every tiem
[2:04:42] <%a_mad_dragon> THAT'S WHAT I SAID
[2:04:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> @RyTYoung He's VERY close to the end
[2:04:43] <%toastybites> @RyTYoung he's almost at the endgame
[2:04:45] <AMUSERNAME> @RyTYoung Almost at the end
[2:04:45] <$joylent_blue> RyTYoung very close to the end
[2:04:45] <+pectusumbra> @RyTYoung This is the end of the game
[2:04:46] <penitentpentwitch> @RyTYoung This is the final act, he has around an hour at most
[2:04:52] <OperatorJo_> very near end
[2:04:53] <%kyh9> The real villain was artistic OCD
[2:05:01] <PatchySouls> shit he's spacing out
[2:05:05] <%RyTYoung> thanks everyone!
[2:05:05] <%Saltmeisterr> math Dansgame
[2:05:11] <SaltyAzteca> "Life, uh, finds a way" Royce goldblum
[2:05:12] <%laserbeaming> he was high on Math
[2:05:23] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> head up his own ass
[2:05:23] <heartlesshealer> "I'm special"
[2:05:26] <%sirisvirus> he's got such a god complex
[2:05:28] <+kalyxchews> i love royce because he's not a villain he's just obsessed
[2:05:30] <+cstigerwright> Is pat going through all the super giant games?
[2:05:31] <%Mendin> Math: We're On It
[2:05:32] <OvaltineDream> ubi ubi
[2:05:32] <dukenux> he really wanted to be special boy
[2:05:35] <+kalyxchews> but that just makes him a villain anyway
[2:05:45] <+pectusumbra> @cstigerwright yes
[2:05:45] <%MelBrooksKA> yes @cstigerwright
[2:05:52] <+cstigerwright> Bet
[2:05:54] <%Saltmeisterr> @cstigerwright ye
[2:05:55] <+oda_flobunaga> It just gives OST
[2:06:01] <jfp4life> ez
[2:06:01] <+Erimos> We got PoNRs boys
[2:06:03] <+Jaysky> Whatever you do--
[2:06:04] <Kalarchis> why does this guy talk like he's super high on mushrooms
[2:06:04] <Make_me_mad> I can't wait for Pyre. It's my favorite thing they've ever done by a mile.
[2:06:05] <dukenux> but this pesky democratic system didn't appreciate his genius
[2:06:21] <SaltyAzteca> Niiiiiice
[2:06:31] <+razielhex> GET OVER HERE
[2:06:31] <+cstigerwright> Excited for wizard basketball
[2:06:32] <+kalyxchews> did Pat never get Bounce() ? it's one of my favorite function OH
[2:06:36] <LoneFonte> YA DID IT
[2:06:37] <heartlesshealer> Purge obtained
[2:06:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> To be fair if you were an artist who was completely unable to do things your own way, you'd get pissed as well
[2:06:46] <+kalyxchews> okay well that answers my question
[2:06:48] <%Saltmeisterr> oh
[2:06:50] <%Saltmeisterr> right
[2:06:53] <+Jaysky> What was Bounce again?
[2:06:57] <SaltyAzteca> That limiter is a fucking PAIN Pat
[2:07:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> Always being told what to make, never able to decide for yourself.
[2:07:06] <%Saltmeisterr> u can't unlock everything on a first playthrough
[2:07:09] <%laserbeaming> @Jaysky Chain Lightning
[2:07:18] <%nmaten> pat NEVER fails
[2:07:19] <reddpop_> @Make_me_mad its wildly underrated
[2:07:19] <+kalyxchews> @Jaysky function that ricochets to multiple enemies
[2:07:23] <%sirisvirus> there are a lot of trials so if you want to beat it tonight might have to skip some
[2:07:27] <+Jaysky> Oooh that one. It can be really fun
[2:07:31] <heartlesshealer> yeah, just gotta unlock as much as you can the first time
[2:07:55] <heartlesshealer> destroy this protect-chain
[2:08:04] <+kalyxchews> Bounce(Pull,Breach) is one of my favorites
[2:08:04] <cherrycottontail> SourPls
[2:08:06] <penitentpentwitch> Whiffed the chicken
[2:08:16] <PatchySouls> By the time he finished the setence, nothing :(
[2:08:32] <SaltyAzteca> Oh you were on the right track
[2:08:34] <%snackcanary> snackcanary subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Transistor is one of my favorite games, the story ? Not quite as much. The storytelling, presentation, and characters? Absolutely.
[2:08:44] <%superc37> if you have a bit of extra space at the end of the turn, then youve already failed.
[2:08:56] <%RyTYoung> ta-da
[2:08:57] <%Broand> I guess that works
[2:09:00] <%superc37> NOICE
[2:09:08] <heartlesshealer> corrupted Vanishing Point, nice!
[2:09:18] <PatchySouls> 75%
[2:09:19] <SaltyAzteca> RIGHT AT THE CUSP
[2:09:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> 80-90%?
[2:09:19] <reddpop_> 90%
[2:09:19] <filialpails> disemvowelled
[2:09:22] <rekinom> 85-95%
[2:09:22] <+SodiumPatrol> 99
[2:09:22] <penitentpentwitch> 91% done
[2:09:23] <%aishman> 99%
[2:09:23] <+kalyxchews> nearly the end
[2:09:23] <CrematedCube> Very very close to the end
[2:09:23] <dukenux> Almost end iirc
[2:09:25] <%Saltmeisterr> ur near the final boss
[2:09:26] <%Arxel1> 40 minutes till the end, assuming you do all the things?
[2:09:27] <aeonicvector> this is final stretch
[2:09:27] <Tisaric> you've got like 90%
[2:09:28] <hot_take_jake> almost done
[2:09:28] <+Jaysky> Very end with story
[2:09:28] <WakeUpThrow> Almost to the end, I would say
[2:09:29] <%laserbeaming> I love the corrupted versions of the songs
[2:09:29] <PatchySouls> perhaps even 80%
[2:09:30] <+mikesapartment> 69%
[2:09:31] <%superc37> final boss should be directly after this safe room
[2:09:31] <Lolcola34> pet the dog
[2:09:32] <Midos1717> 90%
[2:09:34] <user_naim> Almost end
[2:09:34] <%sirisvirus> very close to the end unless you do all these trials
[2:09:35] <%Saltmeisterr> just challenges left
[2:09:36] <BoneBagMel> ohh nice bossa
[2:09:41] <%Gogogolem> 1% pat
[2:09:42] <Finchit> he's almost there
[2:09:43] <AMUSERNAME> Depending on the amount of time these last tests take, roughly an hour or so more.
[2:09:44] <%cvp5127> almost with the tutorial
[2:09:46] <DominoAxiom> Big iq Big plays
[2:09:48] <+kalyxchews> not counting the side-challenges, pretty much done
[2:09:52] <SaltyAzteca> Thats void and cull
[2:09:54] <+Jaysky> What a jerk
[2:09:55] <%Laecerelius> BIG DAMANGE!
[2:10:00] <BoneBagMel> destruction
[2:10:01] <COMB711> if you stop now the next sesh will be super babby length

[2:15:58] <CrematedCube> The haircuts have an insane blast range and big damage
[2:16:04] <+Jaysky> Man vs machine
[2:16:23] <%AzureGale> Wort wort wort
[2:16:27] <%superc37> try focusing on one man at a time, and remember to spam jaunt when youre waiting on turn

[2:17:40] <DominoAxiom> Lets go paaat lets go! FBCatch FBCatch FBCatch
[2:19:15] <DianaTheAscian> hey chat does anyone know why the last part of Pats playthrough of shadowbringers has so many dislikes?
[2:19:25] <+GovernmentMY> tlou2 is good actually and most people dont actually know why they dont like it because they beleives a 4chan troll
[2:19:42] <%RyTYoung> hey oh
[2:19:47] <Glassbrain> it's easy to get pat to sit
[2:19:50] <%AzureGale> lol
[2:19:51] <Glassbrain> it's the shaking part that's hard
[2:19:51] <+rottingpastry> sitting is your job
[2:19:55] <penitentpentwitch> This is an exponential challenge. You can use the dogs' turn to intercept the Hair as it spawns to stop it from getting to you. But once they die, it's mostly a game of keepaway as it's too dangerous to try and resummon them.
[2:19:57] <arkv01> hey stop diddling my usb
[2:19:58] <Animorphimagi> did I miss the ending?
[2:20:08] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:20:09] <+mikesapartment> LMAO
[2:20:12] <$RealThiele> remember guys if you are leaking to press on your taint to get that last bit of pee out
[2:20:13] <%Laecerelius> That was my exact feeling, Pat
[2:20:15] <$joylent_blue> no Animorphimagi
[2:20:20] <heartlesshealer> The Akechi Problem again
[2:20:21] <%RyTYoung> I have no idea what you're talking about
[2:20:22] <+Arizon1317> OOF
[2:20:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Makes sense.
[2:20:29] <%AzureGale> ok
[2:20:29] <%cvp5127> morally grey
[2:20:29] <DianaTheAscian> But your right though @PatStaresAt
[2:20:29] <$Mekhet09> Bad takes.
[2:20:30] <+rottingpastry> tlou2 has a terrible script
[2:20:34] <narusao> so cool
[2:20:35] <%bread_assassin> But he's though.
[2:20:37] <%kyh9> TRONsistor stream

[2:20:45] <%Laecerelius> Gonna Zangief all over him
[2:20:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> No! I'm going to tell them you died like a bitch.
[2:20:45] <Midos1717> XD
[2:20:46] <$RealThiele> but he killed hitler?
[2:20:46] <ape_hawk> what if he liked it!?
[2:20:48] <penitentpentwitch> "Behold the skills my dog has taught me!"
[2:20:49] <ape_hawk> YEAAAAH
[2:20:49] <deuxexgodzilla> No pee in this house of funk
[2:20:55] <%IRashonal> So if Hitler was into it would you still piss on him?
[2:20:55] <DominoAxiom> Let’s compromise. Morally grey?
[2:20:57] <%shurtal> I will turn your grave into a FREE OPEN USE TOILET
[2:21:01] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Is the point that hitler would need to pee on you before you called him bad? :P
[2:21:03] <PatchySouls> the INTELLECTUAL'S piss
[2:21:03] <%IRashonal> Or just double down and shit instead?
[2:21:06] <+Arizon1317> Their uniforms were pretty sick though you cant deny that

[2:21:09] <Animorphimagi> from his perspective YOU are the genocider

[2:22:00] <+rottingpastry> Just do it on new game plus obviously
[2:22:05] <%BinaryFireball> ok
[2:22:06] <DominoAxiom> “Genocider” is just another way of saying “friend”
[2:22:15] <%BinaryFireball> I thought so with the narrator and all that

[2:33:10] <%YakumoYomi> Three lives, if I remember correctly
[2:33:16] <Finchit> Best first 30 seconds of gaming with this boss, but he's piss easy

[2:33:48] <PatchySouls> I don't think Royca brought the best tools for this LUL
[2:33:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> I think the canisters are Traces
[2:33:49] <LoneFonte> probably 4 lives, like when you lose the powers
[2:33:54] <penitentpentwitch> Interesting note: Since many Limiters don't effect this boss directly, it instead increases his stats.
[2:33:57] <%Saltmeisterr> shit
[2:34:02] <+Jaysky> Man, I sucked against this guy cause I didn't think stealth would work
[2:34:04] <SaltyAzteca> OVERKILL PAT

[2:38:33] <+zalonar> Now, Wait to get to the title screen and listen
[2:38:33] <dukenux> i think there's only one ending
[2:38:34] <%donstylo> Transistor is a fucking good game!
[2:38:34] <lobso123> Skip there’s nothing in credits
[2:38:34] <SaltyAzteca> I CRI
[2:38:36] <SaltyAzteca> :(
[2:38:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt When you beat the game, just start a NG+ game. Don't actually play it, just start it.
[2:38:39] <$Mekhet09> There's no alternate ending. BTW.
[2:38:40] <+Jaysky> She could have made it NOT empty and make it inhabitable in case others come across the area since it was implied there were other areas.
[2:38:41] <dukenux> atleast on first playthrough
[2:38:45] <TigerClaws12> aw the kith
[2:38:46] <+Jaysky> But hey, style
[2:38:48] <aeonicvector> an entire city in a computer, no way you had one of those
[2:38:48] <$joylent_blue> lobso123 wrong
[2:38:49] <+oda_flobunaga> err tiem
[2:38:52] <%Garthunox> HEY COMPUTER! Stop all the downloading!
[2:38:54] <+kalyxchews> yeah just look at it
[2:38:57] <+LandOfTheWay> just start it, yeah
[2:38:59] <T_Sasquatch> play recursion for like 5 mins
[2:39:03] <%ssjklyco> Dog
[2:39:05] <s_snowball> SourPls
[2:39:07] <%superc37> @jaysky who tho. all of her friends and family are dead.
[2:39:08] <DominoAxiom> Is this what’s going on in my Alexas head all day
[2:39:13] <aeonicvector> yeah like 5 minutes of NG+
[2:39:13] <WakeUpThrow> Credits are worth a watch for the music alone
[2:39:14] <%DedlokPM> @lobso123 fuck you there's nothing. Nothing my ass.
[2:39:21] <SaltyAzteca> Zangief knows about Transistor end BibleThump
[2:39:22] <Tisaric> there's no such thing as someone else coming across the city
[2:39:22] <Blues_Light> Yeah, NG+ is pretty fun.
[2:39:23] <reonome> :( :( :(
[2:39:23] <CrematedCube> Yeah, get a taste of NG+
[2:39:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wiiill allwaaays fiiiind youuuu
[2:39:26] <Tisaric> they're all dead
[2:39:29] <snakemuho> @Jaysky Who says there's anything outside of this city. There's a reason they say "See you in the Country"
[2:39:31] <aximeck> Bittersweet, but still having some happiness here
[2:39:35] <OvaltineDream> wheat
[2:39:36] <%Arxel1> Also, theres an extra song on the IPad version, might wanna listen to it on youtube LUL
[2:39:38] <dukenux> the country
[2:39:38] <dimensaur> see you in the country
[2:39:40] <PatchySouls> robot arm?
[2:39:41] <%superc37> also fun fact! all of reds song imply that her depression/suicidal-ness before the events of the game.
[2:39:41] <%toastybites> @Jaysky its also implied that literally everyone is dead/digitized
[2:39:45] <heartlesshealer> The Country
[2:39:46] <$joylent_blue> BibleThump
[2:39:47] <+lordericter> feels bad that Royce died when she ended up killing herself in the same way
[2:39:48] <LoneFonte> BibleThump the country
[2:39:49] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump
[2:39:50] <OvaltineDream> ayyy
[2:39:50] <blitzmentalist> <3
[2:39:52] <RiverBirch> Hi!
[2:39:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> HER VOICE
[2:39:54] <%laserbeaming> everyone's dead
[2:39:55] <RiverBirch> Hey.
[2:39:55] <reonome> Hey..... BibleThump
[2:39:56] <$joylent_blue> she can talk BibleThump

[2:40:00] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp
[2:40:03] <dimensaur> BibleThump
[2:40:05] <WakeUpThrow> Hello, desktop wallpaper
[2:40:07] <%cvp5127> you saved the world
[2:40:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> cute
[2:40:11] <%Fooguwu> BibleThump PogChamp
[2:40:11] <GrifGrifter> BibleThump
[2:40:11] <spacecatstreams> nice got here in time for the credits
[2:40:11] <PatchySouls> and that's why she impaled herself
[2:40:12] <Vashido22> THANK YOU DARREN
[2:40:12] <LoneFonte> sure is
[2:40:13] <dukenux> Sword is just another level of simulation
[2:40:13] <+kalyxchews> this ending always makes me BIG cry
[2:40:16] <%AzureGale> F
[2:40:17] <%donstylo> His outfit and stance reminds me of SPike from Cowboy bebop.
[2:40:18] <%sirisvirus> yep theres the ending
[2:40:18] <+oda_flobunaga> soooooooo good
[2:40:19] <alliudmla> look at those fine gals and guys
[2:40:19] <Make_me_mad> Kill yourself to be with your loved ones, kids?!
[2:40:22] <+mechslayer71> That’s the ending I remembered
[2:40:23] <AMUSERNAME> Ashley Barrett <3
[2:40:25] <%maskofmichael> Do You Feel The Emotions?
[2:40:26] <arkv01> god I love red but that fuckin sword
[2:40:30] <+Jaysky> Everyone in the area is dead, sure. Do we know about everywhere else? Nope. Can't be bothered to build the place up before dying? Naw.
[2:40:33] <Vashido22> Yup
[2:40:33] <user_naim> Best game
[2:40:33] <Tisaric> It's a good subversion
[2:40:34] <Tooniearcade> kmaHands
[2:40:34] <SaltyAzteca> LOVE IS!
[2:40:36] <LoneFonte> yep, got me pretty hard
[2:40:36] <$joylent_blue> i mean, the world was completely FUCKED
[2:40:37] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Jumped down 1 level inception
[2:40:37] <+worldbrand> i dont think anyone expected that yeah
[2:40:38] <wibbwobbler> alone together :(
[2:40:39] <heartlesshealer> They moved to The Country
[2:40:40] <%sirisvirus> Everyone is dead
[2:40:40] <TigerClaws12> why live the lie
[2:40:41] <+oda_flobunaga> eeeh
[2:40:41] <aeonicvector> It kinda is
[2:40:42] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> it's not death. the boyfriend was in the sword. so you go in the sword.
[2:40:42] <RiverBirch> I MEAN
[2:40:43] <+kalyxchews> it was a Good Experience
[2:40:43] <dukenux> @Make_me_mad technically they're both still alive
[2:40:43] <ShepardUA> it was
[2:40:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> She can't remake people, so remaking the city has no point.,
[2:40:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's a GREEK TRAGEDY, Pat. How ELSE could it end?
[2:40:45] <aeonicvector> and thats fine
[2:40:45] <RiverBirch> KINDA
[2:40:46] <jfp4life> World was super fucked
[2:40:46] <Blues_Light> I think this is still good. They're back together.
[2:40:47] <+Arkfyre> There's literally nothing left for Red.
[2:40:47] <+Jaysky> Exactly. It was.
[2:40:47] <Finchit> The next game has a better plot
[2:40:49] <%Fooguwu> Just from one simulation to the next sim down really
[2:40:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @PatStaresAt nah they live forever
[2:40:52] <spacecatstreams> such is life
[2:40:53] <%za7az> KappaHD
[2:40:53] <reonome> we killed everyone :)
[2:40:54] <penitentpentwitch> Sort of a gag of Supergiant games. Oops all tragedies! Bastion had the 'best' ending.
[2:40:55] <Blank9> she could've killed herself at any time and it'd be the same deal
[2:40:55] <Vashido22> everyone is prety much dead
[2:40:55] <RiverBirch> It's kind of like
[2:40:56] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Would you kill yourself to meet Paige in the sword?
[2:40:56] <KaiserMario> HAH Love is just chemicals Pat
[2:40:57] <+Plus_On_Black> word
[2:40:57] <%luftraumm1> it's a tragedy
[2:40:57] <%sirisvirus> there is no one left to build the city for
[2:40:57] <%donstylo> Pat, I think they live together in the sword.
[2:40:58] <+BloodyBurney> its a tragedy
[2:40:59] <bentarcher> YES PAT WE TRUELY WERE THE TRANSISTOR
[2:41:01] <LoneFonte> the point is she tried EVERTHING
[2:41:02] <RiverBirch> Oh waht's that other scary horror game
[2:41:02] <CrematedCube> That's the point of Cloudbank, it felt pointless
[2:41:02] <reddpop_> What's left for red? She's alone. She's stopped the process but shes done with it all
[2:41:02] <heartlesshealer> can't make people, so no point to city
[2:41:02] <aeonicvector> Pyre is imop supergiants best story
[2:41:05] <+lordericter> The only relevant part is she killed the Camerata
[2:41:06] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> and there's some elucidation on that once you start NG+
[2:41:07] <+Gorgodrn> Everyone was dead though
[2:41:07] <Khester824> That's what real love is
[2:41:07] <Finchit> How they told the story was good tho.
[2:41:08] <+kalyxchews> i love supergiant games because they're not afraid to make a story that's non-standard
[2:41:09] <hot_take_jake> keep going deeper into the sword code
[2:41:10] <RiverBirch> The one with the underwater thing?
[2:41:11] <+mechslayer71> Pyre’s plot is great from what I played
[2:41:12] <aximeck> So, since it's a "City in the Clouds", it's implied that even if they "die", they probably jack out somewhere, or at least the Transistor hosts them well enough
[2:41:12] <%skizzuto> but is it a true death or did they just escape the simulation
[2:41:16] <snakemuho> was Neo resetting the Matrix pointless?
[2:41:18] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt pyre is easily the best story and plot tbh
[2:41:19] <%sirisvirus> Royce is just a god complex and would love to build his perfect city
[2:41:20] <%Aeoneth> You said it yourself pat. Like 99% of the city was gone
[2:41:20] <dukenux> Transistor is just another simulation
[2:41:23] <+pectusumbra> Meet you in The Country
[2:41:24] <bentarcher> resist the transist to feel something
[2:41:25] <user_naim> Ehh, world is s fuck, bae is in sword
[2:41:26] <+worldbrand> the fact that we're talking about this means it was at least an interesting ending
[2:41:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> BEGIN RECURSION
[2:41:29] <alliudmla> begin recursion, at least for 5min
[2:41:29] <aeonicvector> so yeah, like 5 minutes of NG+
[2:41:30] <SaltyAzteca> YES
[2:41:32] <heartlesshealer> start NG+
[2:41:33] <Tisaric> BEGIN RECURSION
[2:41:33] <Glassbrain> begin recursion
[2:41:33] <$Mekhet09> I can't wait to see Hades' ending. I've been waiting two years at this point and I don't think it'll meet expectation. @PatStaresAt
[2:41:34] <penitentpentwitch> Recursion!
[2:41:34] <AMUSERNAME> NG+
[2:41:35] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Transistor, When the program becomes a pogrom
[2:41:35] <ShepardUA> dew it
[2:41:35] <%ElkRiverDog> Kinda like a city that has no permanence...
[2:41:36] <+zalonar> DO IT
[2:41:37] <LoneFonte> begin recursion
[2:41:38] <$ArcanumArcanum> NG+
[2:41:40] <+LandOfTheWay> YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO PAT
[2:41:40] <Tisaric> FUCK IT'S GOOD
[2:41:41] <%toastybites> start it for a bit
[2:41:42] <T_Sasquatch> BEGIN RECURSSION PLEASE
[2:41:42] <ExpressNode> We truly live in the DATABASE
[2:41:43] <%AzureGale> EXIT TO SHELL
[2:41:44] <heartlesshealer> Recursion
[2:41:44] <$Mekhet09> The problem with early access games.
[2:41:46] <+zalonar> DO IIIT
[2:41:47] <ape_hawk> confirm
[2:41:48] <dukenux> And she could rebuild the city. But she wouldn't be able to bring everyone back
[2:41:48] <PatchySouls> There's not much you can do to end a plot that's essentially "everything's fucked it's all fucked"
[2:41:50] <Shardlab> Hehehehehehehehe HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHA
[2:41:52] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> recursion
[2:41:53] <dukenux> those people are gone
[2:41:53] <arkv01> DATABASE DATABASE
[2:41:53] <+zalonar> LISTEN
[2:41:54] <Vashido22> NG+
[2:41:54] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt NOW IT BEGINS
[2:41:57] <T_Sasquatch> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:41:58] <+kalyxchews> HEHEHE
[2:41:58] <SaltyAzteca> LISTEN
[2:41:58] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat listen to hadestown for musings on the nature of tragedies
[2:42:00] <Glassbrain> a tragedy, again.
[2:42:01] <donkymagooterson> embrace the futility of existence I guess
[2:42:01] <+Jaysky> Everyone is in sword, whenever everything changes nothing changes he haw
[2:42:04] <penitentpentwitch> Hi Royce~
[2:42:05] <AnthonyJMax> back to the beginning
[2:42:06] <PatchySouls> Royce is the Transistor now :)
[2:42:07] <PanicSwytch> NG+
[2:42:07] <alliudmla> btw this not canon
[2:42:07] <aeonicvector> Recursion, the act of redoing a calculation to remove error @PatStaresAt
[2:42:08] <CrematedCube> One detail I love is the calender, and how it makes such little sense
[2:42:08] <T_Sasquatch> TUTORIAL OVER
[2:42:09] <filialpails> I sure hope this recursion is tail-call optimized
[2:42:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> ROYCE
[2:42:10] <snakemuho> SourPls
[2:42:10] <alliudmla> so don't worry
[2:42:11] <Tisaric> FUCK IT'S SO GOOD
[2:42:11] <ape_hawk> OH FUCK
[2:42:11] <%sirisvirus> it's Royce
[2:42:12] <SaltyAzteca> YOU THOUGH!
[2:42:13] <RiverBirch> O _ O
[2:42:14] <TigerClaws12> YE YE YE YE
[2:42:14] <%AzureGale> WTF
[2:42:15] <LoneFonte> ROYCE
[2:42:16] <%Fooguwu> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:42:18] <reonome> ROYCE YOU FUCK
[2:42:20] <heartlesshealer> Kills Today
[2:42:20] <PatchySouls> nah just kidding that was a gag
[2:42:21] <dukenux> HMMM
[2:42:23] <%Saltmeisterr> WTF DOES THAT MEAN
[2:42:25] <snakemuho> nothing else changes @PatStaresAt
[2:42:25] <RiverBirch> That fucked me up
[2:42:26] <%Arxel1> Do it for like 5 minutes
[2:42:26] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> It's just going into the sword. to go into the sword. to go into the sword.
[2:42:30] <%AzureGale> Okay you're good to stop now
[2:42:36] <%sirisvirus> welcome to the loop
[2:42:37] <Glassbrain> a little bit more
[2:42:37] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> there were transistors in the transistor at the end
[2:42:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> NOW you can stop.
[2:42:40] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt thats it, you can stop now
[2:42:41] <donkymagooterson> fuck you no easy way out of this bullshit
[2:42:42] <Glassbrain> read some lore
[2:42:43] <SaltyAzteca> OLD FRIENDS PATRICK LUL
[2:42:44] <+Ataraxis9> Loops!!!
[2:42:45] <wibbwobbler> ??
[2:42:46] <LoneFonte> that it, really
[2:42:46] <Tisaric> that's NG+ now
[2:42:47] <aeonicvector> Recursion
[2:42:47] <+oda_flobunaga> talk about purgatory
[2:42:48] <heartlesshealer> bit more
[2:42:48] <+LandOfTheWay> you're good, pat
[2:42:49] <+kalyxchews> play for like 5 minutes
[2:42:50] <DianaTheAscian> duh its a simulation @PatStaresAt
[2:42:50] <%ssjklyco> looper
[2:42:50] <Finchit> he was always inside the transistor
[2:42:50] <OperatorJo_> game over yeah
[2:42:51] <+zalonar> we good now
[2:42:52] <dukenux> Is this a Nier situation?
[2:42:52] <Glassbrain> or you could keep going
[2:42:53] <heartlesshealer> get to access point
[2:42:55] <+oda_flobunaga> PURGATORY
[2:42:55] <CrematedCube> You had his Trace, he died once before...
[2:42:57] <Vashido22> now its NG+
[2:43:01] <TigerClaws12> RECURSIVE BITCH LUL
[2:43:03] <aximeck> Red and Adam get to leave the loop through "death", so that's their happy ending
[2:43:07] <clloudberry> @PatStaresAt play till you get the first power at least
[2:43:15] <Blues_Light> You now have the opportunity to get all the stuff that you missed out on as well. Like limiter and function lore.
[2:43:15] <dukenux> hmmmmm
[2:43:15] <Glassbrain> not this time
[2:43:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Let you vote on the bridge, yeah
[2:43:21] <T_Sasquatch> Play for like 3 mins
[2:43:25] <filialpails> only in the flashback
[2:43:26] <SaltyAzteca> CHECK THIS
[2:43:26] <heartlesshealer> it let you cast a vote during the flashback
[2:43:37] <heartlesshealer> 3.0
[2:43:39] <%Andrizzleton> Not this early
[2:43:39] <TigerClaws12> she knows it doesn't matter
[2:43:41] <+Erimos> When everything changes, nothing changes...
[2:43:46] <aeonicvector> after next fight you can stop iirc
[2:43:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> When everything changes, nothing changes.
[2:44:02] <CrematedCube> First save point and you're perfectly welcome to stop
[2:44:30] <SaltyAzteca> GO SOMEWHERE!
[2:44:31] <heartlesshealer> ENJOY
[2:44:31] <T_Sasquatch> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:44:33] <+LandOfTheWay> TOO MANY OPTIONS
[2:44:35] <+kalyxchews> :)
[2:44:36] <Vashido22> YUP
[2:44:38] <Glassbrain> the only winning move
[2:44:39] <deuxexgodzilla> yo
[2:44:40] <Glassbrain> is not to play
[2:44:40] <%sshen> sshen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 30 month streak! Thank you Nintendo for selling everyone the PAL version of mario sunshine on switch which ran worse than NTSC version.
[2:44:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Do whatever you want.
[2:44:42] <reonome> :)
[2:44:43] <heartlesshealer> MAN appear
[2:44:45] <%AzureGale> I DUNNO LOL
[2:44:45] <Vashido22> YOUR OPTIONS PAT
[2:44:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah, just go there.
[2:44:45] <aeonicvector> NO LONGER A LINEAR EQUATION
[2:44:46] <ShepardUA> :)
[2:44:46] <+rottingpastry> lol
[2:44:49] <T_Sasquatch> Ok you can stop now LUL
[2:44:51] <+kalyxchews> RECOMMENDED MOVE:
[2:44:51] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt This is NG+ but you can see what getting 2 of the same function does
[2:44:53] <+razielhex> MIND GOBLINS
[2:44:57] <The_Maddness> This is great
[2:45:00] <+rottingpastry> fancy way to say, "You don't need a tutorial."
[2:45:00] <%Saltmeisterr> OK WTF DOES ANY OF THIS MEAN?
[2:45:00] <+oda_flobunaga> when the only winning move is literally any move
[2:45:07] <RiverBirch> "Dont fret, just do something, alright?"
[2:45:15] <aximeck> It's kind of like Undertale where the true reward is stopping the game and letting the ending end
[2:45:17] <+kalyxchews> i love this game
[2:45:18] <Tisaric> yeah fancy tutorial skip
[2:45:26] <aeonicvector> A city within a computer within a city within a computer, and a calculation that no longer has limits
[2:45:28] <snakemuho> it's not Undertale / Doki Doki situation, no
[2:45:43] <%Saltmeisterr> is any of the ng+ stuff plot relevent
[2:45:45] <wibbwobbler> systems within systems
[2:45:56] <snakemuho> plot is the same
[2:46:00] <aximeck> @Saltmeisterr The story doesn't really change, no
[2:46:01] <penitentpentwitch> Recursion (adjective: recursive) occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition.
[2:46:03] <+kalyxchews> it's not a plot rewrite it's just fun
[2:46:09] <aeonicvector> Nothing new new NG+ thats plot relevant that isnt this kind of content, just a realization of the lore
[2:46:18] <Tisaric> The only thing NG+ does is change that first line to be from Royce
[2:46:20] <%Spydurman> No changes to plot just New Game+
[2:46:33] <Vashido22> its just regular NG+
[2:46:35] <heartlesshealer> fair
[2:46:38] <penitentpentwitch> Tis a nice hint
[2:46:38] <LoneFonte> well, yeah
[2:46:40] <dukenux> yep
[2:46:41] <TigerClaws12> return 0;
[2:46:42] <CurrySauseBandit> Hello World, coming into all our dremas NotLikeThis
[2:46:45] <OperatorJo_> fair
[2:46:46] <+kalyxchews> you can stop playing and do pyre now, this opening was just fun
[2:46:46] <%Divryne> Yah it's programming 101 stuff.
[2:46:47] <%Mendin> For those who didn't see Bastion's NG+, occasionally Rucks'd stop and go "Did I say that part already?" or "Stop me if you've heard this one before"
[2:46:52] <RiverBirch> I mean, we're using FUNCTIONS as our fucking weapon techiniques
[2:46:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> Daniel_Is_I subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! I think my favorite part about the game is that the problem the Camerata has with the city is lampshaded near the start: when you go to the weather terminal, Mr. Nobody is annoyed rain isn't an option. His voice isn't represented, only the majority's.
[2:46:54] <Tisaric> also you get to have double functions to stack them on each other
[2:46:55] <tattleworm> well, there's a new thing in terms of skills
[2:46:57] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt that's basically all the new plot stuff in NG+; from here on out it's the same game but tougher
[2:46:59] <tattleworm> since you get dupliocates
[2:47:00] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, that's the go-to "first coding" phrase
[2:47:01] <+oda_flobunaga> it is almost literally the matrix, but run by people so its infinitely worse
[2:47:05] <%kyh9> Ye
[2:47:06] <aeonicvector> but yeah, you've gotten the gist, feel free to move onto pyre
[2:47:08] <dukenux> it's a really strong hint
[2:47:14] <$GoCoSpace> if (going_to_shit_pants()){ dont(); }
[2:47:26] <%Andrizzleton> Pyre is so good
[2:47:27] <CrematedCube> Also, absolutely everything is named after computer and graphical terms
[2:47:28] <dukenux> It's Matrix, but the users are self aware
[2:47:30] <+Seitine> Holy shit you’re right. That’s always the first code you usually do.
[2:47:30] <Glassbrain> oh you wanna see do ya
[2:47:36] <dukenux> so it's more like TRON
[2:47:38] <aeonicvector> oh you can get recursion functions now too, so you can slot into your own skill
[2:47:38] <Glassbrain> it's kinda cool tbh
[2:47:39] <penitentpentwitch> Recursive Functions will be available next level up
[2:47:45] <Tisaric> yeah it's literally all programming turns
[2:47:47] <reddpop_> I would have loved if NG+ was you playing as adam and Red as the voice in the sword
[2:47:49] <Tisaric> terms*
[2:47:49] <dukenux> but like with the Matrix, there seem to be levels to simulation
[2:47:57] <OperatorJo_> I bet Pyre will get at least one tear out of Pat
[2:48:03] <heartlesshealer> bye terminals
[2:48:04] <+kalyxchews> i would have loved if this game actually got a Royce() mode but yeah supergiant moved onto better and better projects
[2:48:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GoCoSpace Function (Don't()) not recognized
[2:48:15] <Bearheart223> Wasnt there a terminal behind you?
[2:48:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> he went for 2.5 hours on this, if he stops he's not gonna play another game I bet.
[2:48:16] <heartlesshealer> locked until poster
[2:48:16] <%toastybites> The Country is apparently some sort of weird digital afterlife within the Transistor itself
[2:48:18] <Glassbrain> check the poster
[2:48:31] <%Arxel1> An access point is after the next 2 fights LU
[2:48:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Maybe he'll play some Gungeon
[2:48:35] <%Fooguwu> i NEED a COMPUTER
[2:48:36] <aximeck> "Logging out" is a more permanent thing and is often referred to as "moving to The Country", since you're as good as dead to the simulation
[2:48:39] <LoneFonte> needs more progress
[2:48:41] <dukenux> Yes, the country is where the nobody was
[2:48:43] <%superc37> @patstaresat closest access is after the first Jerk
[2:48:47] <heartlesshealer> she sing now
[2:48:52] <heartlesshealer> no hum
[2:48:55] <dukenux> So Red let herself be sucked into it
[2:49:11] <%Broand> She's singing instead of humming!
[2:49:31] <aximeck> @dukenux I am happy that Red and "Adam" get to be together at the end
[2:49:39] <AMUSERNAME> she did that last time too, not new to NG+
[2:49:39] <Tisaric> wait does the singing stick around for the whole NG+? That's amazing if so
[2:49:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> Does the hum button sing now?
[2:49:43] <heartlesshealer> that or it's an event thing
[2:49:48] <Vashido22> no
[2:49:52] <penitentpentwitch> I'm really curious what Woolie will qualify this as one of his favorite games
[2:49:53] <%superc37> canon names boxer, not adam.
[2:49:54] <Vashido22> its only because the spine is playing
[2:49:55] <+pectusumbra> at least not yet?
[2:49:56] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> it might be an event thing i would wait idk.
[2:49:58] <Tisaric> oh it's probably just his event thing
[2:49:59] <+LandOfTheWay> hum button comes later, i think
[2:50:13] <%superc37> @penitentpentwitch cuz its real fuckin good
[2:50:13] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt its just for this part, since this song is playing
[2:50:14] <dukenux> @aximeck yeah, considering they were already in some sort of virtual reality, this isn't as bitter of an ending
[2:50:14] <heartlesshealer> pat attention again first time after this poser
[2:50:17] <heartlesshealer> poster*
[2:50:20] <dukenux> like SOMA for example
[2:50:30] <aximeck> TRUE
[2:50:34] <Tisaric> If you don't see how this has Woolie-bait all over it you don't know Woolie
[2:50:43] <penitentpentwitch> @superc37 I'm curious what elements specifcally though? The music? The Vergil final fight?
[2:50:48] <heartlesshealer> Bounce obtained
[2:50:50] <+kalyxchews> Bounce is my fave
[2:50:51] <aeonicvector> Nope, you can get doubles
[2:50:52] <CrematedCube> It reeks of ReBoot
[2:51:03] <%Saltmeisterr> now u can get function dupes
[2:51:17] <Tisaric> I'm surprised there weren't more pause puzzles
[2:51:18] <%superc37> @penitentpentwitch the music, the gameplay, the voice acting, the lore, basically everything. at least for me.
[2:51:19] <limewolfe> soma messed with my head too much
[2:51:22] <LoneFonte> OH RIGHT
[2:51:32] <LoneFonte> DOUBLE FUNCTIONS
[2:51:35] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> yeah function dupes make this system so much nonsense.
[2:51:51] <+Jaysky> It's just due process
[2:51:58] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> in like a good way though i don't think there's challenge to match the level of customization available here.
[2:52:00] <Fro5tburn> erts a terp
[2:52:04] <Tisaric> they put so much fucking effort into the system and adding recursion just makes it that much more nutty
[2:52:26] <+Jaysky> The combat makes me think of a fully realized V.A.T.S.
[2:52:34] <Glassbrain> pat just wants to use functions in functions.
[2:52:45] <wibbwobbler> oh boy
[2:52:51] <+LandOfTheWay> god, you can really break the game with the double functions
[2:52:52] <Blues_Light> Yeah, the amount of customization that this game allows with its functions is so crazy good.
[2:53:03] <Tisaric> yeah honestly this is VATS done extremely well
[2:53:05] <aximeck> The combat system definitely misses some predictions, but it's still a really solid system
[2:53:07] <limewolfe> the sword is a PIPboy
[2:53:09] <penitentpentwitch> Unfortunately, too low level to get recursive abilities. But this is a good stopping point regardless.
[2:53:16] <heartlesshealer> so now who were bounce and Purge?
[2:53:17] <jfp4life> try Jaunt with Puge and Flood for funsies
[2:53:23] <%Saltmeisterr> yeah my current transistor setup is un beatable
[2:53:24] <Glassbrain> when you level up you can use functions with themselves
[2:53:27] <Glassbrain> they can be real good
[2:53:30] <Tisaric> you have to level one more for recursive stuff I think
[2:53:31] <%sirisvirus> so ya you can get 2 of every function in new game+
[2:53:41] <PatchySouls> I think one old shame the devs had about this game is that there were SO many options that the game presents to the player, yet some of them would only stick to what they knew
[2:53:42] <+kalyxchews> hey pat try Bounce(Pull,Breach)
[2:53:44] <clloudberry> one more lvl
[2:53:46] <Finchit> cant what?
[2:53:46] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt Your next level will give you new functions
[2:53:47] <%Arxel1> You need to be like level 15 to get doubles
[2:53:49] <+Jaysky> I never did a second playthrough but I was certainly tempted with the amount of different ways to play
[2:53:49] <%superc37> @patstaresat youre too low level for what youre thinking of
[2:53:57] <penitentpentwitch> You earn a second set of all abilities from this level onward
[2:54:00] <Glassbrain> it's a thing regardless
[2:54:02] <heartlesshealer> who were bounce and purge?
[2:54:03] <PatchySouls> it's great from the player's standpoint, but from a development POV it's kinda wacky
[2:54:04] <mark1247> Lvl 15 for double
[2:54:05] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> yeah you'd have needed to use more limiteres to get it before then
[2:54:09] <LoneFonte> fun game?
[2:54:13] <$joylent_blue> good jorb
[2:54:14] <heartlesshealer> oh well
[2:54:19] <aeonicvector> empty
[2:54:22] <+LandOfTheWay> you feel...?
[2:54:22] <penitentpentwitch> "This was overhyped?"
[2:54:23] <mark1247> Lvl 15 for double function
[2:54:23] <Zurinji> How's that a/c feeling
[2:54:23] <Vashido22> conflicted?
[2:54:25] <SaltyAzteca> What is love, baby dont hurt me
[2:54:26] <+Jaysky> Hollow from the end?
[2:54:26] <aeonicvector> cause its a very dower ending
[2:54:27] <heartlesshealer> feelings
[2:54:28] <OperatorJo_> Pat feels robbed
[2:54:30] <ShepardUA> you feel FeelsBadMan
[2:54:31] <heartlesshealer> ?????
[2:54:32] <limewolfe> soma
[2:54:32] <+kalyxchews> fill that void with pyre
[2:54:33] <+Jaysky> Same
[2:54:35] <Tisaric> the ending is supposed to be a downer
[2:54:37] <TigerClaws12> no one likes bleak endings :)
[2:54:37] <%Divryne> Woolie overhyped it for sure.
[2:54:38] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> about what?
[2:54:39] <$dalmek> I can see it
[2:54:44] <Finchit> too overhyped?
[2:54:46] <donkymagooterson> even the victory is hollow
[2:54:48] <filialpails> that's right, zangief
[2:54:50] <%laserbeaming> Did Woolie overhype it?
[2:54:51] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> woolie did overhype it he overhypes a ton of stuff
[2:54:54] <%Saltmeisterr> that the world isn't fully realized?
[2:54:54] <dukenux> It's not much of a downer either. it's bittersweet
[2:54:56] <wibbwobbler> anti climatic?
[2:54:58] <heartlesshealer> because puppo
[2:55:00] <%cvp5127> LUL
[2:55:00] <aeonicvector> Its not my favorite supergiant game, but its solid as hell
[2:55:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> DAMNIT WOOLIE
[2:55:02] <heartlesshealer> ah
[2:55:03] <%AncelDeLambert> YEP
[2:55:03] <FelixFelicis314> Pyre hopefully next
[2:55:04] <+kalyxchews> i thought it was adequately hype
[2:55:05] <Vashido22> he did
[2:55:06] <timblenaut> Woolie loves FUNCTIONS
[2:55:06] <snakemuho> when doesn't he LUL
[2:55:06] <dukenux> as he does
[2:55:06] <heartlesshealer> woolie hype would do it
[2:55:07] <+lordericter> nah man the games great
[2:55:10] <LoneFonte> LUL well...
[2:55:10] <tattleworm> disagree
[2:55:11] <penitentpentwitch> It has several elements that are square in his ballcourt
[2:55:11] <Tisaric> but it's like 1000% wooliebait
[2:55:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> because short haired redhead
[2:55:11] <%Kaask> sounds like woolie
[2:55:12] <+lordericter> story is awesome
[2:55:12] <@commanderclaw> Woolie loves aesthetics
[2:55:12] <%AzureGale> ok
[2:55:13] <stormhawk9891> He overhypes everything
[2:55:18] <T_Sasquatch> Yes woolie tends to do that LUL
[2:55:18] <lazygertt> yea kinda lame lol
[2:55:19] <CrematedCube> It's a weirdly esoteric ending
[2:55:19] <%sabertoothzombie> nah, game is great
[2:55:21] <%Arxel1> That Vergil doing his Turn() on you was hype tho
[2:55:22] <%superc37> too vague for your taste?
[2:55:24] <%laserbeaming> This game falls very inside the Woolie Sphere
[2:55:27] <PatchySouls> It's very easy to overhype Supergiant Games, sad to say :(
[2:55:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> nah, he just LOVES how it ends
[2:55:29] <%a_mad_dragon> of course he did, the final boss is a vergil fight
[2:55:30] <vVAstrAVv> just get to pyre lol
[2:55:34] <hot_take_jake> this is kinda like bioshock infinite where the plot is kinda eeehhhh but the art/music/etc., is 11/10
[2:55:35] <heartlesshealer> lolno
[2:55:37] <Glassbrain> oh sick
[2:55:39] <Glassbrain> free MIDROLLS
[2:55:41] <alliudmla> It's very open to interpretation
[2:55:43] <+kalyxchews> i think this just gets all the woolie points
[2:55:46] <Rhinoprotoss> Thinking about the story is too hard to stare at
[2:55:47] <snakemuho> Woolie lied because there's a lot open to interpretation
[2:55:49] <CrematedCube> No, very much the opposite
[2:55:50] <mark1247> You fought the final boss on easy mode @patstaresat
[2:55:52] <%AzureGale> Okay, I can see that
[2:55:54] <%Fooguwu> Pat goblins wont allow him to understand plot
[2:55:56] <alliudmla> It did matter tho
[2:55:56] <%YakumoYomi> Like FFXIII-2
[2:55:56] <aeonicvector> Most of its own story has and will happen in the formula
[2:55:56] <mark1247> Without any limit
[2:56:08] <heartlesshealer> Are we reviving Liar Lore?
[2:56:09] <reddpop_> I think the game ended up being rushed and had huge chunks missing
[2:56:10] <Make_me_mad> Woolie liked it because it's just Reboot.
[2:56:13] <Tisaric> I mean what does any story matter
[2:56:14] <%Garthunox> @yakumoyomi pls dont remind me
[2:56:14] <wibbwobbler> actual baby?
[2:56:19] <Rhinoprotoss> Pat refuses non straightfoward story telling
[2:56:22] <Khorneflakes_> cohhM
[2:56:25] <%DedlokPM> @alliudmla you have to remember: this is pat we are talking about
[2:56:25] <Vashido22> the baby
[2:56:26] <WakeUpThrow> Dog baby
[2:56:28] <arkv01> uh which baby?
[2:56:30] <%Archphronimos> Red and Nobody got to be together finally on the same level of existence, so that's a happy ending for them
[2:56:33] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> I would say really stories only matter with how much you like them in the first place really.
[2:56:33] <heartlesshealer> zangief baby
[2:56:33] <+oda_flobunaga> FF 13 -2's ending is great though, Sera dies Caius wins its great
[2:56:34] <%AzureGale> ! DOG AT RISK !
[2:56:34] <%SwdVengeance> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaMenace psaHoldon
[2:56:34] <penitentpentwitch> Pupper in a toilet paper cocoon?
[2:56:38] <+kalyxchews> it's a very artsy kinda story in that it loops in on itself and that's the point
[2:56:41] <TigerClaws12> pat doesn't like lore hunting. M'kay
[2:56:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's not going to be any pyre, if he pays anything else he's going to gungeon.
[2:56:42] <Khorneflakes_> Kitty?
[2:56:45] <arkv01> AWOOOOOO
[2:56:46] <hot_take_jake> Woolie likes short hair/good music
[2:56:56] <%Garthunox> @oda_flobunaga but shes back in 13-3
[2:57:01] <%Broand> Transistor is a greek tragedy, which is fitting because Hades is a Greek roguelike psaDogchamp
[2:57:06] <deuxexgodzilla> make sure pup baby is neato burrito
[2:57:06] <The_Maddness> I have to remind myself hes not talking about Paige when he says "Baby"
[2:57:07] <%Garthunox> SO ARE FANG AND VANILLE!
[2:57:08] <arkv01> gief should be a vtuber
[2:57:09] <snakemuho> To me Transistor is a revenge story first and foremost
[2:57:13] <aeonicvector> its an equation without any limit, recurring infinitely into its own computer, its insanely weird, but also makes sense for a computer to calculate without limits
[2:57:19] <%YakumoYomi> @Garthunox I actually like the game a fair bit more than XIII, but how the plot ends up bothers me. The paradox endings are great, though.
[2:57:21] <%superc37> well i mean theres also great lore, writing, voice acting, and art but go off i guess
[2:57:24] <CrematedCube> It has that Nier-like vibe of existential pointlessness
[2:57:27] <%Archphronimos> @Broand clap
[2:57:34] <%Garthunox> Fuck I hate those game, I love them so much
[2:57:35] <+rottingpastry> Recursion limits are a thing lol
[2:57:36] <user_naim> A computerlike city gets fucked when its denizens get the controls, girl finds her way to bf
[2:57:36] <aeonicvector> very much cube
[2:57:58] <arkv01> remember even if it's a simulation, it's real to me dammit
[2:58:05] <%superc37> @snakemuho but the ending isnt about revenge, its about... well, endings.
[2:58:22] <aeonicvector> Pyre is still my personal favorite since i think its setting, characters, lore, and just, everything flow the best
[2:58:27] <dukenux> the story seems complicated because for the better part game obscures the fact that we're dealing with a simulation here
[2:58:29] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> for this to make sense to me what pat is saying I think I'd have to hear from him like what story does matter. To see where he's coming from.
[2:58:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't like how every artsy scifi game takes place in space 1920.
[2:58:32] <Tisaric> the ending isn't about revenge but I'd say it's a very big part of the story
[2:58:35] <aeonicvector> even though its gameplay is divsice
[2:58:37] <%Archphronimos> he told the bike "see you on the farm" ...
[2:58:44] <snakemuho> @superc37 yeah, in the end the revenge didn't even matter
[2:58:46] <Make_me_mad> A virtual matrix city where everyone votes on how the world looks/works, and then some people get together and decide they need to be in charge because they're so much better than everyone else, and they break the city's controls and cause the whole thing to fall apart accidentally.
[2:58:54] <CrematedCube> The emptiness of it all is part of its emotional punch.
[2:58:57] <Tisaric> yeah "story doesn't matter" doesn't make sense unless you define which ones do
[2:59:01] <LoneFonte> not sure it if i'll watch pat's pyre stream or try a new playthrough...
[2:59:01] <+Jaysky> Lore is nice, writing is solid, gameplay is fun but I was always irked by the gameplay then run away till cooldown fights. Super styling looks, and unconventional ending whether that be for good or bad.
[2:59:02] <dukenux> Revenge, or more setting scores
[2:59:06] <Rhinoprotoss> More a case of constant change makes nothing matter
[2:59:07] <Tisaric> like it clearly matters
[2:59:08] <Vashido22> @aeonicvector Same here, I love everything about pyre. easily one of my fav games ever
[2:59:17] <chocobodundee> did pat beat it?
[2:59:17] <Make_me_mad> It's simple but the game tries to make it seem more complex than it is because I guess the characters aren't allowed to just admit that it's a virtual world.
[2:59:19] <dukenux> Red is after her voice, and getting her bf back
[2:59:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dog do as dog do
[2:59:36] <%superc37> i dont even agree with the theory thats its all virtual, in fact i think its the opposite where the country is the matrix while cloudbank is real
[2:59:38] <arkv01> yeah dogs will do that
[2:59:38] <$joylent_blue> monkaS
[2:59:42] <+xerotwo> GOBLINS
[2:59:44] <+Jaysky> SAVE HIM
[2:59:46] <LoneFonte> oh.
[2:59:47] <dukenux> Haunted
[2:59:49] <arkv01> he was mashing retweeet and like?
[2:59:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> Stompy puppy mad
[2:59:51] <OperatorJo_> Red just wanted an answer, searched, found it and took the only way to Adam
[2:59:52] <%YakumoYomi> He demanded your attention
[2:59:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> singing
[2:59:52] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> he has his own mind goblins
[2:59:52] <+Delenay> like frather like son
[2:59:53] <Khorneflakes_> cohhM He sense ghosts!
[2:59:54] <penitentpentwitch> He is Drama Queen
[2:59:54] <BootyZipperooni> Sleep running?
[2:59:56] <CrematedCube> I'm not sure if the populace even knows it's virtual
[2:59:56] <jeffishype> he needs to shite
[2:59:57] <%maskofmichael> Was he cute doing it?
[2:59:58] <LoneFonte> and then he stopped?
[3:00:00] <Khorneflakes_> senses***
[3:00:00] <+Jaysky> Save him from the nothing he has become
[3:00:02] <%superc37> @make_me_mad whos to say thats its a virtual world tho?
[3:00:04] <PanicSwytch> Zangief has inherited the mind goblins
[3:00:15] <aeonicvector> Its not even over-rating, he over-hyped it
[3:00:15] <Rhinoprotoss> Time for Pat opinion oh boi
[3:00:18] <KaiserMario> Overhyping, not overating...
[3:00:23] <+Jaysky> Oh yeah
[3:00:24] <G03933> this seems like the kind of game Woolie would over rate though
[3:00:28] <deuxexgodzilla> Zangief wants big attention from big pat
[3:00:32] <ergulor> Bastion is still great
[3:00:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Transistor has the best aesthetic of all Supergiant games imo
[3:00:37] <jaid251> Transistor is mid
[3:00:38] <Rhinoprotoss> Yes overrate cause Pat is Woolie
[3:00:42] <+Jaysky> Of all time?
[3:00:46] <Xelhesia> i could see that a little bit
[3:00:47] <Tisaric> It's pure Woolie-bait though
[3:00:47] <CrematedCube> They fixed Bastion's big problem of ripping weapons away from you at every turn
[3:00:48] <LoneFonte> And for a lot of people...
[3:00:50] <$joylent_blue> it has a ton of style, and maybe not as much substance as some would like
[3:00:51] <Tisaric> like everything about it
[3:00:52] <BootyZipperooni> Bastion is the only Supergiant game i've ever played and enjoyed
[3:00:52] <jfp4life> Transistors game play is top notch imo
[3:00:52] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> this is also one of my favorite games really.
[3:00:52] <TigerClaws12> mind goblin doesn't like obscurity :)
[3:00:52] <+kalyxchews> transistor is one of my favorite games as just an experience
[3:00:53] <LoneFonte> like me
[3:00:54] <T_Sasquatch> Yes
[3:00:55] <Shardlab> The aesthetic is magnificent
[3:00:55] <+rottingpastry> The gameplay hook is good, but it needs more.
[3:00:56] <KaiserMario> I remember him saying is his favorite game of all time at one point
[3:00:56] <%superc37> i disagree.
[3:00:57] <Vashido22> no shit
[3:00:59] <arkv01> yeah you right
[3:01:01] <+oda_flobunaga> short hired red head
[3:01:01] <%Broand> ough
[3:01:02] <dukenux> Yeah, so Kappa
[3:01:03] <arkv01> computers n shi
[3:01:03] <%Fooguwu> Patrick "Meaning is meaningless, people die when they're Transistor'd" Boivin
[3:01:04] <+Rolandknight> hahah reboot
[3:01:04] <PatchySouls> Woolie? Obsessed with Reboot? No way Kappa
[3:01:04] <penitentpentwitch> WoolieBait multiplier was high here
[3:01:07] <WakeUpThrow> The comparison to ReBoot was spot on
[3:01:07] <donkymagooterson> high bar
[3:01:09] <reddpop_> cant wait for the spoiler-cast /debate
[3:01:09] <T_Sasquatch> Its fun to play tho
[3:01:12] <LoneFonte> There is a lot of "Style of Substance"
[3:01:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[3:01:14] <Rhinoprotoss> Truly Pat can't think about it when he's staring
[3:01:14] <%laserbeaming> It's a VERY Woolie game. I personally like Pyre more.
[3:01:14] <Xelhesia> its aesthetic as fuck
[3:01:16] <%sirisvirus> Combat is also super fun when you get into it
[3:01:17] <LoneFonte> over*
[3:01:19] <OperatorJo_> Transistor has the best presentation, Pyre has the best story overall
[3:01:22] <arkv01> but did you
[3:01:23] <heartlesshealer> wow pat
[3:01:24] <+kalyxchews> Big Splash Factor is a woolie thing
[3:01:24] <Tisaric> It doesn't play like shit though
[3:01:28] <%Gimmpy2143> Gimmpy2143 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! butts
[3:01:28] <LoneFonte> and thats fine.
[3:01:29] <%za7az> I think my least favorite part was that the bosses felt lack luster
[3:01:33] <deuxexgodzilla> Reminds Woolie of Reboot?
[3:01:33] <%skizzuto> It's good, Pyre's my favorite of the Supergiant games
[3:01:37] <$joylent_blue> the function system is super cool
[3:01:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> He likes Transistor because he had a Dante Vergil fight at the end
[3:01:41] <heartlesshealer> don't compare Transistor to cyber connect
[3:01:44] <%za7az> Also I wish there were more of them
[3:01:46] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> also the level of customization of hte combat even if it doesn't really fully let you realize it by not giving you the challenge needed is good.
[3:01:47] <arkv01> just get it off your chest pat
[3:01:47] <%Daniel_Is_I> Plays well, looks AMAZING, writing doesn't work out exactly.
[3:01:50] <+Jaysky> I thought Hades was the best gameplay?
[3:01:51] <penitentpentwitch> I appreciate the QoL that went into Hades that came from complaints at this game
[3:01:51] <PatchySouls> It's a very hard game to talk about
[3:01:53] <Xelhesia> i also prefer Pyre
[3:01:57] <heartlesshealer> sure
[3:01:57] <snake_eater_guy> if you get any fatter your keyboard will have your tummy as a table
[3:01:58] <%Saltmeisterr> fair fair
[3:01:59] <SaltyAzteca> Cull was pretty good tho right?
[3:02:01] <dukenux> Fair
[3:02:04] <PatchySouls> @Jaysky yeah, it still is
[3:02:06] <Vashido22> fair
[3:02:06] <user_naim> I mean that’s what Blade Runner is. Themes and presentation
[3:02:06] <%aishman> Yeah I can understand that
[3:02:08] <%zeroarturia> Lol
[3:02:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> It feels like a hypothetical Transistor 2 would be fantastic
[3:02:09] <OperatorJo_> I'm with Pat there.
[3:02:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Ping is MVP
[3:02:10] <T_Sasquatch> I didn't play pyre because it has no multiplayer (im not joking)
[3:02:11] <aeonicvector> its my 4th favorite super giant game, which is sad, but also still a really good game
[3:02:12] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> OH COOL TWITCH AD THANKS AMAZON
[3:02:12] <+DraggoonLord> Fair
[3:02:13] <+kalyxchews> i think most people feel that way but then they have their own loadout they only use
[3:02:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Tisaric He's not saying it played badly, just that the game didn't do it for him.
[3:02:16] <SaltyAzteca> Thats all I ask for Kappa b
[3:02:16] <%GinAndRoses> GinAndRoses subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! hey pat it's a computer
[3:02:17] <TigerClaws12> it's a cyberpunk dystopia masked as a utopia
[3:02:19] <%aishman> While I think Transistor is cool in, every aspect of it. I fucking ADORE Pyre
[3:02:20] <%luftraumm1> put it into perspective pat this game came out as an iOS mobile title
[3:02:20] <hot_take_jake> it's a good game/had potential to be amazing, but it just needed more time
[3:02:23] <%aishman> Such a shame it's too weird for most
[3:02:30] <%MeowZerstar> MeowZerstar subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[3:02:32] <yamikami13> STFU about ping breakfast
[3:02:33] <AMUSERNAME> understandable. It's basically a Super-Materia system, but those materia aren't all winners. @PatStaresAt
[3:02:33] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> well liek with souls games don't you just not like more than half of the weapons i would find it hard to say if that's... liek a mark on the game if you're making it out to be one?
[3:02:34] <%donstylo> Did you wishe for less management?
[3:02:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Ping is the best move
[3:02:35] <%sirisvirus> void+crash+cull is broke as shit
[3:02:35] <Tisaric> Transistor was a lot more focused
[3:02:36] <Finchit> Bastion is more active in comparison
[3:02:36] <yamikami13> PING IS SHIT
[3:02:37] <%superc37> I also disagree. in fact just from wathcing you play through, i found plenty of playstyles and combos i hadnt even touched in my runs
[3:02:39] <snakemuho> yes, Bastion is longer
[3:02:40] <aeonicvector> Bastions story also you down harder at the RIGHT moment
[3:02:40] <penitentpentwitch> I feel Bastion is better in the gameplay department.
[3:02:41] <Khorneflakes_> oof
[3:02:44] <+Jaysky> For story? I'd say so.
[3:02:44] <snake_eater_guy> Matt sends his regards
[3:02:45] <%sabertoothzombie> disagree
[3:02:46] <dukenux> well, it was longer, but i feel otherwise
[3:02:46] <Rhinoprotoss> Refusal of Transistor meat for narrator meat
[3:02:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @yamikami13 nah
[3:02:53] <PatchySouls> I'm scared to try out Bastion :(
[3:02:55] <CrematedCube> It's a neat game to watch because people tend to use wildly different loadouts
[3:02:57] <heartlesshealer> Transistor it's more story and song
[3:02:57] <Daxalog> If you go online you can see the usages for Functions some are at 3-4% usage
[3:02:58] <dukenux> Transistor felt more concentrated for me
[3:02:59] <yamikami13> Ping is the worst active actin
[3:03:00] <timblenaut> there's more than you touched on, lots of non-intuitive combos
[3:03:04] <snakemuho> Transistor is like 3-4 hours if you ignore the challenges
[3:03:05] <dukenux> Bastion had a bit more padding
[3:03:06] <$Mekhet09> Hades is their best gameplay.
[3:03:07] <yamikami13> there is nothing you can do to ping to make it good
[3:03:07] <TigerClaws12> dark souls of Supergiant games :)
[3:03:12] <Finchit> It didnt go shutup tho?
[3:03:13] <+oda_flobunaga> in a pooter
[3:03:14] <%goatbait> goatbait subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Pat, mind telling me what's the appeal to FF14? I've been trying to get into it for a while and I just bounce off despite wanting to make friends. Have a good stream!
[3:03:14] <%nmaten> it doesnt tho?
[3:03:14] <%Fooguwu> If only pat had an imagination
[3:03:17] <arkv01> haha you idiot, you got PRANKED
[3:03:18] <Rhinoprotoss> It's hard to think about it
[3:03:21] <%sirisvirus> I couldn't finish bastion. It's combat got really repetitive for me.
[3:03:21] <Tisaric> It's not that it doesn't matter though
[3:03:21] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> Actually it was more about it all being deeper in the transistor i think.
[3:03:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Man Ping is such good moves
[3:03:23] <aeonicvector> The city IS the flashdrive, and your a matrix in a matrix in a matrix in a matrix in a matrix
[3:03:26] <%Saltmeisterr> bastion's world feels more realized
[3:03:30] <%aishman> But you love how nothing matters in Dark Souls.
[3:03:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> Cloudbank is a city.
[3:03:33] <+LandOfTheWay> the setting Kappa
[3:03:33] <OperatorJo_> it gives a LOT of context for Cloudbank, it gives 0 history
[3:03:34] <heartlesshealer> a data cloud
[3:03:34] <%superc37> Cloudbank is a city.
[3:03:35] <aeonicvector> hence the recursion
[3:03:35] <LoneFonte> a city
[3:03:35] <$dalmek> I mean it's a cloudbank
[3:03:36] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> cloudbank is the transistor i think.
[3:03:36] <%Divryne> Cloudbank is just a server farm.
[3:03:36] <+Jaysky> Cloudbank is shut up
[3:03:37] <dukenux> A city
[3:03:37] <+oda_flobunaga> MATRIX
[3:03:39] <%za7az> I feel that
[3:03:43] <Rhinoprotoss> No
[3:03:43] <KaiserMario> They are a bit too artsy-fartsy in a way that can detract it to certain people's tastes, I think...
[3:03:43] <%Fooguwu> ....
[3:03:44] <+kalyxchews> it doesn't approach the world in the way that most people would expect and that does feel somewhat of a letdown
[3:03:46] <heartlesshealer> Recursive events
[3:03:47] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> It's just a digital world. Don't overthink it.
[3:03:47] <Finchit> Any story is pointless by that logic
[3:03:48] <%TheWinged7> its the cloud pat
[3:03:49] <timblenaut> it's a cloud server
[3:03:50] <tattleworm> that's reductive
[3:03:50] <Khorneflakes_> ...
[3:03:51] <%superc37> Not even remotely canon.
[3:03:51] <alliudmla> Jesus christ
[3:03:51] <snakemuho> Dark Souls is a painting in a painting in a painting Kappa
[3:03:51] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> what story isnt' pointless in liek a grand sense?
[3:03:52] <Shardlab> Pat, you're asking for more than they cared to hand you
[3:03:52] <+oda_flobunaga> Matrix run by humans not aliens
[3:03:53] <%luftraumm1> research the way the game game out pt, just to get some nuance, woolie is emotionally invested in this enough to not get nuance
[3:03:53] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt its like it gives context, but not story
[3:03:53] <Tisaric> And so?
[3:03:56] <dukenux> what? how? The people are real
[3:03:57] <CrematedCube> What is Cloudbank: Literally whatever you want it to be
[3:03:58] <Bearheart223> newsflash pat, the kid wasnt real too
[3:03:58] <+kalyxchews> most people would have played into the story the way Royce does instead
[3:03:59] <%Fooguwu> pat...
[3:03:59] <tattleworm> no videogame character is real
[3:03:59] <wibbwobbler> no answer 4 u, hopp u had fun tho!
[3:03:59] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> i am not sure wht you mean with that comment?
[3:04:00] <%AzureGale> Next week's podcast is going to be REALLY interesting
[3:04:00] <LoneFonte> IT IS FOR THE PROTAG
[3:04:01] <user_naim> I get what you mean, it just didn’t matter to me
[3:04:01] <Tisaric> No story has real people
[3:04:02] <%Archphronimos> IT'S REAL TO THEM
[3:04:04] <%toastybites> the people are real
[3:04:04] <Idon__> That's a gross misinterpretation
[3:04:05] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt no videogame is real
[3:04:06] <%luftraumm1> define real
[3:04:06] <dukenux> The world is virtual, the users were real
[3:04:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Pat it's a video game, of course the people aren't real
[3:04:07] <Vashido22> ok pat
[3:04:07] <$dalmek> I think the problem is the world SEEMS so interesting that I really wanna know more
[3:04:08] <%laserbeaming> I don't think that's a problem?
[3:04:08] <CrematedCube> It's VRChat made real
[3:04:09] <morow1ec> they're not real it's a story LUL
[3:04:10] <Vashido22> ITS REAL TO ME
[3:04:12] <user_naim> Real enough
[3:04:12] <%aishman> Well they are real, like they are real people but like, in their world they're stuck in an endless loop
[3:04:13] <%SwdVengeance> Pat with fiction: What? That doesn't really exist? DOES NOT MATTER THEN
[3:04:13] <+Quinn_Carter> Transistor is shut up
[3:04:13] <+pectusumbra> It's the reality you wish for, put your brain into a computer and get to do whatever you want.
[3:04:14] <heartlesshealer> PAT
[3:04:15] <TigerClaws12> reductive goblin
[3:04:16] <+pectusumbra> Then its gets fucked
[3:04:17] <timblenaut> its a character driven story
[3:04:18] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> pat they are all video game characters lol
[3:04:19] <Rhinoprotoss> Fuck. Pat isn't real to me either
[3:04:19] <$RealThiele> cloudbank is the Furry barge
[3:04:19] <Shardlab> You expect explicit explanation, but you will never get that
[3:04:20] <Finchit> I dont understand pat
[3:04:21] <penitentpentwitch> "We are living, in a digital world. And Red is a digital girl."
[3:04:21] <Make_me_mad> Usually I think Pat's kinda nuts but I'm with Pat on this one.
[3:04:21] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> So you're saying Transistor is the Log Horizon of videogames? :P
[3:04:21] <$Mekhet09> Pat if it was permanent you know you'd transfer your self into digital space.
[3:04:22] <heartlesshealer> THIS IS A BAD ARGUMENT FOR VIDEOGAMES
[3:04:22] <Khester824> Then every story is pointless
[3:04:22] <aeonicvector> but are you real to you if THIS is computer
[3:04:22] <chocobodundee> pats doing that thing againnnn
[3:04:23] <Bearheart223> Are video game characters real to you pat?
[3:04:24] <T_Sasquatch> @goatbait where are you in the game so I can explain because im 180 hours in because of pat in the last month
[3:04:27] <OperatorJo_> Pat cannot compute
[3:04:28] <Khorneflakes_> Surprise Pat, you're living in a simulation Kappa
[3:04:28] <+rottingpastry> I kinda agree, I think it uses ambiguity as a crutch.
[3:04:30] <+lordericter> I think you just have a weird brain pat
[3:04:31] <%SwdVengeance> Sounds like Goblins
[3:04:32] <M4eta> UNDERTALE ANNIVERSARY CONCERT
[3:04:34] <+Promessa_EX> microsft azure
[3:04:34] <tattleworm> disregard goblin opinion
[3:04:36] <KaiserMario> So it's reverse wrestling to you?
[3:04:36] <user_naim> Pat’s AI hate crimes
[3:04:37] <dukenux> oh nooo, solipsism NotLikeThis
[3:04:38] <%Fooguwu> Pat you are a simulation running on a brain, everything you know about the universe is something your brain has done
[3:04:40] <%luftraumm1> define real is an interesting point for a game to make
[3:04:40] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> it's liek saying ff14 sotry is pointless cause it's game characters lol
[3:04:42] <heartlesshealer> Until you [Exit Shell]
[3:04:43] <Tisaric> the infinite loop is just a NG+ thing
[3:04:44] <The_Maddness> if it thinks like a person it might as well be a person
[3:04:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> If Super Mario Sunshine isn't real how can any game be real?
[3:04:45] <TigerClaws12> Toilet man can't compute LUL
[3:04:46] <%superc37> pat ng+ isnt canon
[3:04:47] <%toastybites> The recursion is non-canon
[3:04:47] <wibbwobbler> on the lower tier of sg games?
[3:04:47] <+artschooltrash> You're 100% correct
[3:04:47] <+kalyxchews> i agree just because i wanted more story
[3:04:48] <G03933> it feels a little full of itself
[3:04:48] <+Promessa_EX> your perception is reality i guess
[3:04:48] <snakemuho> it's not in a loop, it ended, NG+ stuff is just funzies
[3:04:51] <aeonicvector> Heaven is "outside" hence the escape from the shell
[3:04:52] <Tisaric> it's not actually the story
[3:04:52] <deuxexgodzilla> It's a corkscrew spiralling down to meaninglessness
[3:04:52] <%koolaid_kevster> feelsweirdman
[3:04:53] <dukenux> Sorta, but not realy
[3:04:53] <Rhinoprotoss> Sounds like we need Kojima to whack you with the story
[3:04:54] <Shardlab> Sounds a lot like your mind gobbos flaring up
[3:04:56] <jfp4life> Bastion can technically have an infinate loop
[3:04:57] <+Fnir> Relatability is lost this way
[3:04:57] <+pectusumbra> Chat before was saying The Country is logging out
[3:04:59] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt NG+ isnt canon
[3:04:59] <%SwdVengeance> Goblin opinion is goblin
[3:05:00] <aeonicvector> now is outside dead?
[3:05:00] <chocobodundee> thanks twitch auto ads
[3:05:03] <%luftraumm1> it's a good game
[3:05:04] <OperatorJo_> NG+ isn't canon
[3:05:05] <%Broand> It's called the country because there's no internet connection there BOOM GOT IT
[3:05:08] <+Jaysky> I never saw it as a loop, I saw it as her going into the Transistor because when everything changes nothing changes. Only difference is now she's with her bf.
[3:05:09] <Make_me_mad> People trying to say "Oh this is Pat's mind goblins" are actually being incredibly insensitive about that shit right now. It's his opinion, christ.
[3:05:10] <SummonerMagno> feel a bit "uummmmm im arrrtttt"
[3:05:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> ng+ is just a little easter egg. The story is that you killed yourself and you're in the transistor with bf forever.
[3:05:12] <$RealThiele> Death road to Canada VR
[3:05:13] <+kalyxchews> i absolutely loved the world and characters but it feels like it ends too soon
[3:05:15] <user_naim> That’s just NG+ I think, not really story
[3:05:15] <%aishman> Oh NG+ isn't canon?
[3:05:16] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> recursion is going in the transistor death is the "country" at the end
[3:05:17] <Xelhesia> an infinite loop with no real resolution isn't satisfying as an ending
[3:05:18] <CrematedCube> One point to make is: we have no idea HOW FAR in the future this is
[3:05:18] <Vashido22> what happens in NG+ is not canon
[3:05:20] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> when they say see you in the country
[3:05:20] <Tisaric> NG+ isn't a real part of the story
[3:05:21] <%luftraumm1> you are experiencing overhype backlash
[3:05:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> oh its purgatory. got it.
[3:05:22] <filialpails> "they're not real people to me" says man who accept eternity as a toilet
[3:05:26] <Make_me_mad> Saying that someone not liking the same thing you like is mental illness is fucked up.
[3:05:28] <LoneFonte> thats fine
[3:05:29] <M4eta> UNDERTALE 5th Anniversary Concert STARTED
[3:05:30] <T_Sasquatch> Its 8/10 imo
[3:05:33] <Finchit> What's the next game you playing pat? Pyre?
[3:05:34] <%luftraumm1> bastion is great
[3:05:35] <+oda_flobunaga> We just need David Cage to write a supergiant game maybe? LUL
[3:05:36] <%Fooguwu> What if I told you Bastion is a virtual world
[3:05:37] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> you think i tpromised more than it actuallydelivered
[3:05:40] <%Arxel1> Transistor had a way better Vergil fight than Bastion tho Kappa
[3:05:41] <aeonicvector> Bastion and Pyre are my favorite stories atm, Transistor is great, but its def not the most solid of the bunch
[3:05:41] <heartlesshealer> genocide story better for pat, got it
[3:05:42] <Rhinoprotoss> That's cause its more straightforward
[3:05:43] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Pyre is the best one anyways
[3:05:43] <hot_take_jake> I wanna be free from my meat-prison and into the cool USB sword
[3:05:55] <SaltyAzteca> yeah its VERY short
[3:05:56] <Vashido22> Pyre's story on the other hand... LETS GO
[3:05:57] <penitentpentwitch> Bastion, worldview wise, is ultimately more hopeful.
[3:05:59] <aeonicvector> Pyre is iirc the longest one
[3:06:01] <CrematedCube> It's very heady, and some people like or dislike that
[3:06:01] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> i do wish it was longer myself
[3:06:01] <+Jaysky> Woolie promised more than the game delivered is what you mean
[3:06:02] <%aishman> Eh I like how short it is
[3:06:03] <LoneFonte> 8 hours-ish?
[3:06:03] <+kalyxchews> transistor goes for the artistic emotional ending instead of tackling it the way most adventures would
[3:06:03] <%aishman> BUT HEY
[3:06:04] <+Plus_On_Black> I did not like the story, when I played it.
[3:06:04] <PRchris13> I liked the game music and art style ... the voices were good.. gameplay was good... for a indie game was ok ... like 7 out of 10... or 6
[3:06:04] <Tisaric> It is very short compared to what you expect yeah
[3:06:05] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, blame Woolie
[3:06:05] <%DedlokPM> @snakemuho you would have a point if it didn't confirm the loop with the addition of a single voice line from the final boss when Red touches the Transistor at the start of NG+
[3:06:09] <KaiserMario> Woolie praised it for being a quick game too
[3:06:10] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> throw wollie under the transistor!
[3:06:10] <%goatbait> When in doubt, Blame Woolie
[3:06:11] <$RealThiele> the combat is transistor is oof, as is their use of non-standard naming
[3:06:11] <Tisaric> Pyre/Hades are long though yeah
[3:06:12] <OperatorJo_> lesson learned: never overhype anything
[3:06:12] <%arancet> how dare woolie enjoy things
[3:06:12] <+rottingpastry> I walked away from Transistor going, "Wow, that was GREAT! Why don't I like it more?"
[3:06:13] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> didn't overstay its welcome
[3:06:13] <Shardlab> Woolie just enjoyed it more
[3:06:13] <Vashido22> YEYEYE BLAME WOOLIE
[3:06:13] <hot_take_jake> cant wait for the podcast fight
[3:06:14] <deuxexgodzilla> How is pyre?
[3:06:16] <$dalmek> let's band together to blame Woolie
[3:06:16] <LoneFonte> FUN PODCAST
[3:06:17] <%aishman> GET READY FOR SUPER GIANT'S WEIRDEST, LONGEST GAME
[3:06:18] <yamikami13> the biggest issue i think most people had it was that it is very short.
[3:06:20] <%laserbeaming> It's an 8 hour game? It's still one of the most gorgeous games out there
[3:06:22] <%DedlokPM> Nah.Blame yourself for your goblins
[3:06:22] <penitentpentwitch> I await the argument in the next podcast
[3:06:22] <$RealThiele> woolies fault
[3:06:23] <%RyTYoung> Woolie stole the pie again?
[3:06:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Damn Woolie for being him
[3:06:25] <wibbwobbler> pat is having opinions again
[3:06:25] <Vashido22> PODCAST
[3:06:26] <%cvp5127> yeyeyye
[3:06:27] <aeonicvector> i do aswel
[3:06:28] <%Arxel1> DUNK ON HIM ON THE PODCAST
[3:06:28] <timblenaut> the meat is in the challenge modes
[3:06:28] <heartlesshealer> Woolie DID indeed praise short length
[3:06:28] <+Jaysky> Race war?
[3:06:29] <+vaderxyz1970> I was much more interested in Ceylandia than the City
[3:06:30] <Finchit> More like resigned woolie
[3:06:32] <SaltyAzteca> Naaaah itll be fiiiiine
[3:06:32] <%Saltmeisterr> probably
[3:06:32] <Vashido22> oh I cant wait for the podcast
[3:06:33] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> probably cause he always overhypes things he likes a lot
[3:06:33] <shadowstreakXIII> YUP
[3:06:34] <tattleworm> very excited to skip the goblin conversation
[3:06:34] <derap41> Woolie is a big baby
[3:06:34] <OperatorJo_> VERY upset
[3:06:35] <+kalyxchews> i'm looking forward to the podcast that comes out of this
[3:06:35] <$RealThiele> yeyeye
[3:06:35] <%superc37> HO BOOY
[3:06:38] <Shardlab> This next CSB is gonna be wild
[3:06:39] <Rhinoprotoss> Pat ignores story for podcast bits
[3:06:40] <Vashido22> DUNK HIM ON THE PODCAST
[3:06:42] <UltimateDomon> I'm very excited
[3:06:45] <AMUSERNAME> The OST makes great background music in day-to-day life.
[3:06:45] <%toastybites> Punished Woolie
[3:06:47] <%cvp5127> do it tomorrow
[3:06:47] <wibbwobbler> noooo
[3:06:48] <hot_take_jake> this was primarily a phone game, yeah?
[3:06:48] <Vashido22> thats absolutely fair
[3:06:50] <leargo> that will be intertaining
[3:06:52] <stabbityrabbit> That RTX podcast is gonna be fucking great.
[3:06:52] <%goatbait> Breakup()
[3:06:53] <Khorneflakes_> LUL over rated
[3:06:54] <%superc37> HM.
[3:06:54] <Tisaric> I don't think it gets overrated by anyone but Woolie
[3:06:54] <SaltyAzteca> PUNISHED WOOLIE
[3:06:55] <aeonicvector> its a 9.X outta 10. but its also WAY OVERHYPED by woolie
[3:06:55] <SpookyBeef7> I feel he'll understand, but there's definitely going to be a discussion for sure.
[3:06:55] <derap41> 9/10 still overrated=?
[3:06:56] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @PatStaresAt Will this be a conversation that happens on the panel tomorrow?
[3:06:56] <%ElkRiverDog> That last boss tho
[3:06:57] <LoneFonte> Pat and Woolie discuss Transistor (2:15:30)
[3:06:57] <%za7az> It's gonna be great :)
[3:06:57] <%thelaxinator> Didn't Woolie give Sayonara Wildhearts his GOTY over DMCV?
[3:06:58] <$RealThiele> "But you see Pat I dont care what your score is because i know mine"
[3:06:59] <%YakumoYomi> I feel similarly about Breath of the Wild.
[3:06:59] <%superc37> big disagree.
[3:07:00] <T_Sasquatch> You got hyped by him . It's understandable
[3:07:00] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> its just a matter of taste
[3:07:00] <Tisaric> what are you talking about
[3:07:00] <%aishman> Yeah that's fair
[3:07:01] <Finchit> Isnt that what woolie is?
[3:07:03] <%DedlokPM> I forsee an initally upset woolie devoling to sighing resigned woolie
[3:07:05] <%SwdVengeance> Boils down to taste
[3:07:06] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Woolie status: shaking
[3:07:06] <CrematedCube> It is easily overhyped, yes
[3:07:06] <PanicSwytch> CSB Final?
[3:07:08] <hot_take_jake> just like Bioshock Infinite
[3:07:08] <Rhinoprotoss> Style over substance that you won't think about
[3:07:08] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Just today on their stream, Reggie said he never watched Avengers because people overhyped it too much, so he never bothered
[3:07:10] <Tisaric> how is there no meat
[3:07:12] <%RyTYoung> Woolie will be big upset if you do it tomorrow Pat DONT DO IT TOMORROW
[3:07:12] <UltimateDomon> its like a good 8
[3:07:16] <Vashido22> @DedlokPM thats way too accurate
[3:07:17] <OperatorJo_> it came on mobile way after it got a pc/ps3 release
[3:07:17] <Finchit> Woolie loves style tho
[3:07:20] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> personally I disagree but I haven't played bastion in a very long time. hope to play hades soon
[3:07:21] <PRchris13> @patstaresat ... you should check a game call Child of Light .. the story was good and music is good .. gameplay is ok .. is base turn combat ...
[3:07:21] <jfp4life> Woolie also said that you probably won't like it as much as him iirc
[3:07:22] <$RealThiele> roll face across spike maze
[3:07:22] <Xelhesia> i agree with that
[3:07:22] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt Have you played hades with the recent update because it probably has the best combat system.
[3:07:22] <user_naim> Nah it’s big good though. Style is substance
[3:07:22] <+Jaysky> @Tisaric He's talking about how the game is overrated
[3:07:23] <FelixFelicis314> Hey, not for everyone. But glad you enjoyed some of it.
[3:07:26] <chocobodundee> Building combos was so much more fun in transistor
[3:07:27] <PatchySouls> from the sounds of it, Woolie overhyped the game way too much
[3:07:28] <%Broand> It's because the story had many hooks left unhooked
[3:07:30] <+pectusumbra> I mean the gameplay is wild, I can't think you can say it's got no substance, even if you don't care for it
[3:07:40] <Ell1ot> there's hardly any meat in these gym mats
[3:07:41] <%donstylo> The talk with Woolie would feel like a pair breaking up. Don't break his heart too much. :)
[3:07:50] <+BeardedChazen> are you playing Pyre as well Pat?
[3:07:54] <deuxexgodzilla> I would agree. The soundtrack and the visual design really boosted alot of people's opinion of the game.
[3:07:55] <heartlesshealer> Dishonor
[3:07:59] <wibbwobbler> execution is everything
[3:08:00] <Vashido22> wtf, I'm with Pat on something
[3:08:00] <Khorneflakes_> Some things don't need answers, or if any at all
[3:08:01] <$RealThiele> oceanwide, inch deep
[3:08:04] <derap41> Stop all the downloading
[3:08:05] <T_Sasquatch> Infinite has high concept ideas ? LUL
[3:08:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Preach
[3:08:11] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> I would say the way it's being made out right now is that there's no substance. there isn't no substance to it but there's not as much as pat wants.
[3:08:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> please don't liken transistor to bioshock infinite that's just mean
[3:08:17] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> so whens Bioshock Infinite? :P
[3:08:22] <%superc37> there is tho
[3:08:22] <aeonicvector> and similarly, Nier Automata goes to nitzche meaninglessness, and yet has fangs and intersting discussion points
[3:08:24] <KaiserMario> So Nier Automata is better
[3:08:24] <%Broand> But it's got nothing to do with the actual revenge plot
[3:08:25] <%Bt_Robot> WHY ARE YOU STILL BROADCASTING? SHOULDN'T YOU BE WATCHING THE UNDERTALE 5TH ANNIVERSARY CONCERT?
[3:08:26] <%Ne1son> Holy shit Pat is so right
[3:08:27] <Vashido22> @
[3:08:29] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> I think it's the transistor
[3:08:32] <$joylent_blue> i understand where you're coming from for sure
[3:08:32] <$RealThiele> Transistor is like the new Tron movie
[3:08:34] <CrematedCube> Lots of "Shut up because it's just so pretty"
[3:08:35] <+Jaysky> It would have benefited from more time playing
[3:08:37] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt dont pay attention to the infinite loop thing, NG+ isn't canon
[3:08:39] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@arkv01) (warning)
[3:08:41] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> @arkv01 that would be the goblin-free way of doing things
[3:08:42] <+Nekolaius> Would you say you're more of a story/context person than a style/presentation person?
[3:08:45] <hot_take_jake> I've gone back to the sound track more than the game, and I bought a bunch of art from suppah giant
[3:08:45] <PatchySouls> COMPUTERS
[3:08:50] <wibbwobbler> at least u liked bastion
[3:08:51] <heartlesshealer> Paige might be watching the Undertale Concert upstairs
[3:08:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We need to get VaatiVidya on the case Kappa
[3:08:52] <%superc37> nah the country is the computer while cloudbank is real
[3:08:52] <%Fooguwu> double computer PogChamp
[3:08:53] <aeonicvector> NG+ is as canon as Bastions
[3:08:54] <LoneFonte> aside from the whole UI flavour and programming jokes?
[3:08:58] <%luftraumm1> see the context of release for more accurate criticism but it is in fact short
[3:09:01] <%za7az> psaBig psaUp
[3:09:03] <%laserbeaming> It's like a weird simulation of a purely democratic society that kind of went wrong]
[3:09:03] <timblenaut> virus
[3:09:05] <SpookyBeef7> Would you say that it would benefit from another hour or two of story to help clear things up a bit?
[3:09:05] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> you saying computer is making me confused are you making it out as like a third party computer or as the transsitor lol. idk.
[3:09:08] <CrematedCube> It's basically a Grey Goo scenario with lots of frills
[3:09:11] <AMUSERNAME> @PatStaresAt How did you like the aesthetic of having each lore character being basically an exploration of a college major?
[3:09:11] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Funny that you think that then because MAN is Pyre's setting MEATY.
[3:09:14] <+Plus_On_Black> I agree with Pat
[3:09:16] <%luftraumm1> you are right, but also not quite
[3:09:22] <user_naim> The process stuff and perspective on change was mest
[3:09:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I can't believe Pat gave Transistor ONLY a 9/10
[3:09:27] <$RealThiele> i just noticed when he leans his right tit is eating Jill
[3:09:32] <$Mekhet09> What if you were the best orator?
[3:09:32] <heartlesshealer> =T
[3:09:34] <%arcielardor> does that mean you have DMC?
[3:09:36] <%Broand> It's got a lot of cool plot hooks, but they don't pull on them enough
[3:09:38] <%arcielardor> hate
[3:09:39] <+Nekolaius> not saying that, just saying in your mind, the context matters/improves/makes it worse more than the style
[3:09:40] <Vashido22> I cant belive Pat HATES transistor
[3:09:43] <+Nekolaius> possiblye
[3:09:44] <hot_take_jake> no that's Horizon: Zero
[3:09:45] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> 9/10 bad game!
[3:09:47] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> lol
[3:09:48] <%donstylo> But does everything need to be told? I don't think you need always the full view.
[3:09:48] <%Arxel1> It did present a good 'SHIT WENT BAD REAL FAST' scenario
[3:09:50] <Xelhesia> a good premise is only made good with good execution. this game prolly needed a few more hours to breathe with a more definitive ending.
[3:09:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> how dare he says he like a different game more than what I like
[3:09:52] <+vaderxyz1970> Your retelling would be interesting to listen to though
[3:09:55] <wibbwobbler> patstaresat BULLSHIT
[3:09:56] <+pectusumbra> Oh stop guys.
[3:09:56] <%DedlokPM> @BeardedChazen No. The Pyre art is included in the overlay art of the Supergiant Games Playthrough border only for funsies. teenSTARE
[3:09:56] <+rottingpastry> 8.8/10
[3:09:57] <heartlesshealer> there's the thing
[3:09:58] <Vashido22> thats about right
[3:09:58] <OperatorJo_> yeh
[3:10:03] <Tisaric> I could see that definitely
[3:10:05] <$joylent_blue> Yes_Man_Kablaam he never said it was bad lol
[3:10:08] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> you mean those plot threads commit suicide :^)
[3:10:08] <yamikami13> again it was a very short game, and i also think their fist ps3 game so dev time might have spend on the technical side.
[3:10:13] <%arancet> is that not allowed? is a simple story not allowed to have a high concept background? is it FORCED to explain it all?
[3:10:15] <deuxexgodzilla> Idk Rise of Skywalker would benefit greatly from being told via word of mouth. It'd be shorter
[3:10:18] <aeonicvector> 2/3rds into the reveal, but not the reveal itself?
[3:10:23] <heartlesshealer> it was always personal though
[3:10:28] <user_naim> Is NG+ canon though? I thought it’s just an easter egg
[3:10:29] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> I think the talking with Royce and stuff was my favorite part of it. and just hearing about the process and stuff it's all weird and neat.
[3:10:29] <heartlesshealer> they killed her man
[3:10:29] <$RealThiele> THE DEAD SPEAK
[3:10:31] <CrematedCube> I adore the game, but I also recognize how loose the plot actually is
[3:10:32] <reddpop_> Not fighting the big Camerada guy was a weird choice
[3:10:34] <%Deft_Thought> Final Boss fight/track is pretty great though
[3:10:34] <+Jaysky> When finish the Spine was the highlight for me
[3:10:36] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> and the whole city just fucking disappearing is cool.
[3:10:36] <+BeardedChazen> @BeardedChazen FeelsBadMan
[3:10:36] <+Nekolaius> they did take her voice
[3:10:43] <+Nekolaius> and killed her lover
[3:10:44] <Vashido22> oh well, Pyre next week
[3:10:46] <%RyTYoung> what time?
[3:10:49] <heartlesshealer> how reach RTX panel?
[3:10:50] <arkv01> RTX in your RTX
[3:10:52] <snakemuho> Sony are showing RTX? PogChamp
[3:10:54] <wibbwobbler> if the plot is important to u, i can understand you finding this game lacking
[3:10:58] <PRchris13> @patstaresat have u played Child of Light
[3:11:00] <Yes_Man_Kablaam> oh and woolie obviously loved transistor due to the last fight with the rival lol.
[3:11:01] <hot_take_jake> The potential is there, it just needed more development. I loved it cause I'm willing to be blinded by flashy presentation & art
[3:11:01] <%aishman> How many people are gonna ask about Transistor?
[3:11:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I feel if they made a Transistor Replugged, it could be a 11/10
[3:11:02] <OperatorJo_> Pyre: Prepare to Cry
[3:11:02] <T_Sasquatch> Yea sure rtx LUL
[3:11:02] <$RealThiele> VR chat panel
[3:11:03] <%GinAndRoses> a section for giant emails nice
[3:11:03] <%superc37> where do qe watch it?
[3:11:04] <AMUSERNAME> @PatStaresAt The game feels mostly focused on a polished art aesthetic, great OST tracks, and atmosphere, along with a cool materia system.
[3:11:04] <heartlesshealer> ah
[3:11:04] <Midos1717> SONY Panel!!??
[3:11:08] <%RyTYoung> Rooster teeth site?
[3:11:11] <%spitelite> rooster teeth site
[3:11:14] <%DedlokPM> Except it was never about saving the city for Red. It was about getting the killers of her man and her voice back
[3:11:14] <%nmaten> *** according to woolie's tweet
[3:11:16] <%donstylo> And SOny ofc.
[3:11:16] <+pectusumbra> alright, have a good night
[3:11:17] <%TheWinged7> so its the old christmas podcast?
[3:11:17] <%Broand> @arancet It's less that and more of the effort expended on the setting wasn't hugely valuable to the main plot,
[3:11:18] <rekinom> Facebook gaming of course Kappa
[3:11:19] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Did you see that SFV added a Kairi costume for Ryu?
[3:11:20] <$RealThiele> woolz said RT
[3:11:21] <%za7az> Sounds fun
[3:11:21] <%laserbeaming> The weird political background to the story is kind of just relegated to text logs and could have taken more of a center stage.
[3:11:22] <hot_take_jake> gonna talk about those big vid cards
[3:11:22] <pre10cious_1> hello Patrick 👋
[3:11:23] <+Jaysky> Yeah what's going on with the Sony thing tomorrow
[3:11:25] <deuxexgodzilla> Pet your cat pat
[3:11:31] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> SuperGiant Remake WHEN?
[3:11:37] <heartlesshealer> Dog is a cutie pie *Pat pets Elmo instead*
[3:11:38] <$RealThiele> yeyeyey pet
[3:11:41] <deuxexgodzilla> Thank you
[3:11:48] <SummonerMagno> rosterteeth has their own stream i think
[3:11:54] <arkv01> im not a furry but I'll stroke anything with fur
[3:11:58] <+Promessa_EX> wowow almost like mega 64 expo
[3:12:00] <$RealThiele> Toxoplasmosis working against the mold
[3:12:01] <+OnTheDonner> I just joined, 3 hoursi n, have we gotten to the game yet?
[3:12:06] <$joylent_blue> PogChamp
[3:12:07] <%superc37> not rly tho? the story was just fine as a character driven narrative.
[3:12:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat is only streaming the CSB RTX@Home panel.
[3:12:12] <heartlesshealer> Again, congrats on dad beating cancer <3
[3:12:14] <$joylent_blue> good for that person's dad
[3:12:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Fuck you Cancer
[3:12:16] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp
[3:12:16] <$RealThiele> fuck cancer
[3:12:24] <%YakumoYomi> Man, fuck Facebook for their Oculus shenanigans. Way to ruin arguably the coolest line of VR headsets on the market with their "WE NEED MORE INFO ON YOU" nonsense
[3:12:24] <%superc37> <3
[3:12:25] <dukenux> i agree that they maybe aimed for a bit too grand scope, for how compact the game is
[3:12:28] <%Puhff> psaDab on your dad's cancer
[3:12:34] <deuxexgodzilla> Cancer is an asshole
[3:12:42] <pre10cious_1> Super best friends were the OGs of the internet🙌
[3:12:46] <dukenux> Dunk on the cancer
[3:12:54] <dukenux> piss on it
[3:13:02] <Xelhesia> high concept does't always = good. shenmue is a good example of this, tho i would put this over shenmue any day.
[3:13:02] <Tisaric> the only thing oculus had going for it was price and the quest though it does suck losing the quest line to facebook's BS
[3:13:12] <+Promessa_EX> internet started in 2013
[3:13:32] <ShepardUA> more like a dagger Kappa
[3:13:35] <%donstylo> Library of Ruina is very good.
[3:13:38] <wibbwobbler> red?
[3:13:40] <+Promessa_EX> melissa mega melons huh
[3:13:41] <+OnTheDonner> trophy husband
[3:13:42] <heartlesshealer> Paige missing Undertale concert confirmed
[3:13:46] <%skizzuto> aww Elmo clean him head
[3:13:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Nice Jill Sandwich shirt btw
[3:13:47] <dukenux> Shenmue's problem isn't even "high" concept. It's that it's story just run its wheels in place
[3:13:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don;t know why so many people feel the need to try and convince Pat to like a game when he didn't like it. he never said it was a bad game, in fact he said it was a good game, but it just wasn;t for him. Let people have their opinions, man....
[3:14:03] <deuxexgodzilla> Paige and Pat Transistor cosplay when?
[3:14:06] <leargo> that sexy swords game...
[3:14:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> thanks pat
[3:14:08] <dukenux> nailed it
[3:14:15] <wibbwobbler> lol
[3:14:20] <+Promessa_EX> elmo clean face
[3:14:21] <Xelhesia> nier automata is also a loop but it solves itself which is way more satisfying.
[3:14:26] <heartlesshealer> !
[3:14:31] <+xerotwo> KONOSUBA
[3:14:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> hello me
[3:14:35] <heartlesshealer> Red Aqua emote? :0
[3:14:38] <rekinom> VoteNay
[3:14:39] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[3:14:39] <%ImFlippinOut> FUCK THE DMV
[3:14:44] <%YakumoYomi> PAIGE YOU COWARD
[3:14:45] <%Garthunox> WHYYYYY
[3:14:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Shenmue's problem is that fact that Shenmue gets way too far up it's own ass.
[3:14:46] <%TheWinged7> Yes, im paige says rd aqua
[3:14:48] <OperatorJo_> For Paige not liking space she sure is up there a lot.
[3:14:50] <dukenux> FAKE FAN
[3:14:51] <+rottingpastry> bluh
[3:14:55] <+xerotwo> EEKUM BOKUM
[3:14:56] <T_Sasquatch> FUCK Aqua
[3:14:58] <$joylent_blue> it kinda comes down to woolie and others (me lol) being cool with filling in the blanks themselves
[3:15:04] <penitentpentwitch> Pretty much
[3:15:06] <Sartastic> FortOne FortOne FortOne
[3:15:10] <donkymagooterson> fascinating shit
[3:15:11] <dukenux> Yes, the story isn't complicated
[3:15:13] <arkv01> its all fanfiction fodder
[3:15:15] <$joylent_blue> yeah exactly
[3:15:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> I really like Royce as a villain because of his personality
[3:15:21] <%RyTYoung> that Royce fight has sold me on playing the game
[3:15:24] <wibbwobbler> god damn it
[3:15:26] <%superc37> @rumtumtugnutz eeeh i think the problem is less that he likes it and more that he he thinks it overrated.
[3:15:27] <dukenux> it's obscured by the presentation
[3:15:36] <dukenux> which i see can be a problem to some people
[3:15:56] <penitentpentwitch> I enjoy Dark Souls lore, but I can understand why it irks people
[3:15:58] <%arancet> so, dark souls
[3:16:01] <arkv01> ye, fanfiction baaaaby
[3:16:07] <$joylent_blue> yeah, i get that
[3:16:09] <+Promessa_EX> i liked his voice while he said it
[3:16:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> @superc37 That's probably true. I can see how if he went in with no expectations he would have enjoyed it more.
[3:16:22] <lazygertt> nah souls is good
[3:16:23] <deuxexgodzilla> Fun Fact: trees can naturally explode due to different conditions so stay inside folks. And PUT ON YOUR MASKS!
[3:16:23] <$RealThiele> souls had more details at a faster pace
[3:16:24] <heartlesshealer> was inception even good?
[3:16:25] <+OnTheDonner> The point of the ending is that it doesn't matter
[3:16:28] <CrematedCube> Exactly
[3:16:29] <%Garthunox> is it a dream or is it real
[3:16:30] <dukenux> i can't believe Pat HATES both Transistor and Dark Souls now
[3:16:32] <Khester824> The hero wants revenge and the villains fucked up there’s nothing left to interpret
[3:16:34] <+Gorgodrn> Dark Souls is still telling concrete info. Even if there are mysteries.
[3:16:34] <T_Sasquatch> Inception is nuts
[3:16:35] <+rottingpastry> What's to argue about?
[3:16:36] <%SirGO0SE> thats super fair
[3:16:36] <ShepardUA> meh... inception is overrated
[3:16:37] <OperatorJo_> NotLikeThis
[3:16:39] <%luftraumm1> bah that's just for argument's sake
[3:16:47] <+Promessa_EX> trees can fall on you and kill you at any moment
[3:16:49] <%ElkRiverDog> They took “Brevity is the better part of whit” too literally
[3:16:50] <%luftraumm1> inception is overrated
[3:16:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @superc37 But I still would argue that trying to convince him that his opinion is wrong is still silly.
[3:16:53] <wibbwobbler> u can't answer the questions yourself
[3:16:54] <%RyTYoung> I just watched Memento's a couple of nights ago again, what a crazy movie
[3:16:55] <dukenux> Speaking about "overrated" LUL
[3:16:57] <%zeroarturia> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[3:16:57] <reonome> red just wanted to be with the one she loved....
[3:16:58] <%superc37> eeeeh i disagree wih the opinion thats its "left too wide." i think that more than is enough is explained, especially if you dig hrough the dialogue.
[3:17:05] <penitentpentwitch> Considering Bastion, Transistor and Pyre. I have great tragic expectations for Hades.
[3:17:07] <$RealThiele> inception is only good for the memes
[3:17:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Inception was stupid.
[3:17:16] <OperatorJo_> Red went with Adam, Cloudbank went brrr
[3:17:18] <dukenux> Memento is a much better mindfuck movie, holy shit
[3:17:19] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt Not enough meat on the really pretty bones
[3:17:25] <KaiserMario> When you go complain to Woolie, will at least be kind, so he won't completely dismiss your argument? LUL
[3:17:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Inception was a movie
[3:17:26] <%maskofmichael> It's just a game, shut up consume and get hyped for more gameplay
[3:17:28] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:17:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> OOF.
[3:17:34] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[3:17:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> Memento was dope
[3:17:35] <Vashido22> IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE
[3:17:36] <%Dementedpenguin> Thanks, Nintendo 4Head
[3:17:39] <%luftraumm1> this game's story didn't age well because of it's original release constraints
[3:17:41] <Xelhesia> souls also doesn't rely on its story as its main focal point. the lore is fantastic but it doesn't really to complete the games
[3:17:44] <$RealThiele> this deal is getting worse all the time!
[3:17:46] <%preeeow> awww itsbbad?
[3:17:57] <T_Sasquatch> The switch is a fucking joke and nintendo fans are children
[3:18:08] <$RealThiele> edgy
[3:18:11] <penitentpentwitch> Oops all dictators!
[3:18:14] <T_Sasquatch> But hur durr zelda
[3:18:18] <%YakumoYomi> I wouldn't go that far, but I still expect more from Nintendo and their flagship franchise's anniversary collection
[3:18:19] <godzookylives> @T_Sasquatch are you 5?
[3:18:19] <%AzureGale> BUTTS
[3:18:19] <T_Sasquatch> Muh Mario

[3:18:23] <$ArcanumArcanum> @T_Sasquatch found the guy who's sad he doesn't have a switch
[3:18:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is it a computer?
[3:18:32] <rekinom> I'm a cuputah, stop all the dooownloading
[3:18:33] <+rottingpastry> A COMPUTER?!
[3:18:40] <T_Sasquatch> @godzookylives no u
[3:18:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> Would you download a Red?
[3:18:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What if the Transistor was a dildo?
[3:18:48] <%Garthunox> @t_sasquatch I hate the things you like
[3:19:00] <CrematedCube> But are we also computer?!
[3:19:03] <dukenux> @Breakfast_Megapowers who says it couldn't be

[3:19:30] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yea
[3:19:30] <$RealThiele> el gato
[3:19:31] <PanicSwytch> Do it
[3:19:32] <Xelhesia> STAR OCEAN 3 WAS GREAT UNTIL ITS ENDING FUCKED THE FRANCHISE :(
[3:19:35] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> with.....?
[3:19:36] <T_Sasquatch> @garthunox im not mad honestly. I just find it obnoxious that the switch can be so lack luster tech wise yet its praised
[3:19:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I have fat kitty
[3:19:51] <%hq_residential_house> hq_residential_house subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! hey pat just got here hope you're doing well
[3:19:51] <%superc37> cuz im fairly certain i did a dono after the game ended
[3:19:52] <arkv01> naaaw SO3 ending was GRRREAT
[3:19:57] <LoneFonte> with OBS...?
[3:19:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> Frustrated exhale
[3:19:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> pet pet pet pet
[3:20:05] <%Garthunox> @shepardua you say that sarcastically but I'd love a DRK weapon like the Transistor
[3:20:06] <dukenux> Nintendo are masters of "no, because no :) "
[3:20:11] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeah OBS can do recordings
[3:20:19] <heartlesshealer> When Star Ocean 3 was my first Star Ocean game ever :)
[3:20:21] <%YakumoYomi> @Xelhesia It didn't help that SO4 and 5 were a step down in quality (4 was alright, 5 was mediocre at best)
[3:20:22] <$RealThiele> consistency in your channel, good content, and luck
[3:20:29] <ShepardUA> @Garthunox i was only half-sarcastic
[3:20:31] <%cvp5127> YEA CHEATING
[3:20:34] <T_Sasquatch> My help :) ?
[3:20:38] <%Garthunox> dont shoot down his opinions
[3:20:39] <%Fooguwu> Make it like when you talked about darth vader
[3:20:41] <ShepardUA> chat, don't forget to breath Kappa
[3:20:42] <%AzureGale> Say NO U
[3:20:43] <%za7az> Me? :)
[3:20:43] <heartlesshealer> at least it had a shit-ton of reading that I liked going through
[3:20:44] <donkymagooterson> dear woolie, I respect your opinion but this game kinda sorta sucks
[3:20:44] <$RealThiele> say his ideas are shit
[3:20:48] <%thelaxinator> There's some correlations between woolie liking Sayonara Wildhearts and Transistor. It's all Aesthetic and music, everything else hardly seems to matter. Sayonara is basically Wario Ware and he said it was his GOTY over DMCV
[3:20:48] <SaltyAzteca> tlou2 Kappa
[3:20:49] <ergulor> Call him a liar
[3:20:53] <+OnTheDonner> Speed Racer
[3:20:54] <Khorneflakes_> oh my god, it's Indivisible
[3:20:54] <+Promessa_EX> i'm tired pat
[3:20:55] <%SolidusRex> Agree to disagree
[3:20:55] <dukenux> Which one?
[3:20:56] <CrematedCube> Yeah, let's workshop this response
[3:20:57] <$joylent_blue> indivisible? :D
[3:20:58] <arkv01> just tell him how it is, he's a weakling who kneels to style
[3:20:58] <%Ranryu692> Indivisible?
[3:21:00] <$joylent_blue> eyyy
[3:21:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ohhhh

[3:21:09] <Vashido22> OH
[3:21:09] <LoneFonte> HMMMMM
[3:21:10] <penitentpentwitch> Write down your points so that you have the correct language. A good key phrase helps in arguments.
[3:21:10] <PanicSwytch> Pat, Just don't be a dick and explain what are your pro's and con's
[3:21:11] <heartlesshealer> Paige, Bonetrousle is on
[3:21:11] <arkv01> OH NOOOO NOT INDIVIDIBLE
[3:21:12] <%aishman> IT'S ALL MIKE'S FAULT
[3:21:12] <+xerotwo> O H B O Y LUL
[3:21:13] <+rottingpastry> You right
[3:21:13] <Idon__> OH RIP WOOLIE
[3:21:13] <hot_take_jake> "Hey Woolz, I really liked the style and presentation of Transistor, but felt it was lacking in substance" *dabs four times*
[3:21:14] <Vashido22> LUL
[3:21:16] <T_Sasquatch> I think transistor has a lot of substance
[3:21:16] <lazygertt> indivisible sucked lol
[3:21:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> where do I send my credit card number, full name and 3 digits on the back?
[3:21:17] <%TheWinged7> yeah, i fell of indivisible hard troo
[3:21:19] <PatchySouls> uh ohhh
[3:21:21] <SaltyAzteca> PUNISHED EL WOOLIE
[3:21:23] <donkymagooterson> lead with what you liked and then explain where it fell short
[3:21:23] <dukenux> Ok ok, understood
[3:21:24] <%za7az> Argue from the perspective of the story as opposed to the gameplay and you should fine
[3:21:24] <+xerotwo> That's going to be a MINEFIELD doodLUL
[3:21:25] <+Promessa_EX> just forget about it by monday
[3:21:25] <$RealThiele> MIKE Z FAULT
[3:21:25] <T_Sasquatch> Indivisible fucking sucks tho
[3:21:26] <heartlesshealer> nvm
[3:21:27] <%GinAndRoses> just lie to him and say it's great :)
[3:21:29] <OperatorJo_> just say he brought your expectations to a different level. Good game, just pushed you way far out the rung
[3:21:34] <ShepardUA> Persona 5 is more similar in that regard
[3:21:37] <Idon__> Indivisible felt like it was made by people who didn't like nor understand RPGs.
[3:21:37] <heartlesshealer> Mike fucking Z
[3:21:39] <$RealThiele> jerk off motions
[3:21:40] <%superc37> just blame mike z
[3:21:44] <%TheWinged7> the art and like Razmi are great, but fuck asjna and the constantly changing combat
[3:21:44] <arkv01> we will NOT bring up mr Z
[3:21:48] <hot_take_jake> yes
[3:21:48] <$dalmek> just say that
[3:21:50] <+rottingpastry> Indivisible was very meh. It feels like it was written by a 14 year old.
[3:21:55] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:21:56] <LoneFonte> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:21:56] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:21:57] <wibbwobbler> is the gameplay in transistor bring it down in your opinion? i love the combat
[3:21:57] <reonome> LUL
[3:21:58] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[3:21:59] <godzookylives> Don't be an asshole and let him talk. Also don't blurt out that Transistor sucks
[3:22:05] <dukenux> Just say "Hey Woolie! ...It's not as bad as Indivisible" @PatStaresAt
[3:22:05] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[3:22:06] <T_Sasquatch> Loooooooool
[3:22:06] <KaiserMario> Ok, I laughed out loud for real
[3:22:08] <+MasterDecoder> -insert jerk off motions here- Come on Pat, just let it go
[3:22:08] <arkv01> yeah ajna's shitty brat attitude was TOO shitty
[3:22:09] <T_Sasquatch> hahahhahahha
[3:22:11] <lazygertt> lmao yep
[3:22:12] <Idon__> it ALL goes back to Reboot!
[3:22:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> The difference is P5 is a 200-hour JRPG and Transistor is an 8-10 hour game
[3:22:13] <dukenux> LUL
[3:22:15] <OperatorJo_> Woolie likes computes
[3:22:16] <%hq_residential_house> LUL
[3:22:16] <%za7az> LUL
[3:22:17] <%thelaxinator> Sayonara Wildhearts was his favorite
[3:22:20] <hot_take_jake> the problem is just assuming it's reboot
[3:22:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> he did
[3:22:23] <%aishman> This is literally a difference of taste man. It's "How much can you forgive the basic story because of how awesome the aesthetic and presentation?"
[3:22:23] <rekinom> my god
[3:22:24] <$dalmek> like clockwork
[3:22:25] <heartlesshealer> BEASTWARS
[3:22:25] <$RealThiele> reductive woolie
[3:22:26] <arkv01> like clockwork LUL
[3:22:26] <+rottingpastry> MAXIMIZE!
[3:22:26] <rekinom> the aristocrats
[3:22:26] <%TheWinged7> So, as a dev myself alot of what i like about Transistor was the inside jokes
[3:22:26] <Xelhesia> @YakumoYomi i agree completely. to me 3 is still good but 4 and 5 do nothing with what 3 left off of which sucks since those games are on a single timeline.
[3:22:27] <deuxexgodzilla> Separate the style and separate the substance of Transistor so that we're talking just about the story
[3:22:27] <dukenux> ???
[3:22:28] <%Dementedpenguin> I will be listening if he brings up reboot LUL
[3:22:29] <dukenux> LUL

[3:22:29] <heartlesshealer> thanks for hosting
[3:22:29] <%Piemono> Is that any different than liking Cyberpunk asthetic's?
[3:22:29] <PanicSwytch> Games are Subjective. Something u consider a 9, someone else considers a 7
[3:22:30] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ahahaha
[3:22:32] <%superc37> dont bring up reboot for starter

[3:22:37] <penitentpentwitch> Focus on why you don't like the game, not why he likes it. Focusing on his reasons frames it as an attack on him.
