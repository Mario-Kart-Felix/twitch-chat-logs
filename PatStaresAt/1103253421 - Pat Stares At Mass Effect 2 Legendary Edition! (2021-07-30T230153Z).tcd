[0:05:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @TIME_PUNCHER they decided to be bad since like the late 80s
[0:05:21] <derap41> we all knew they where bad but now they're worse
[0:05:26] <$Futurecity10> Twitter has been hell today
[0:05:27] <peachy996> chris chan bad
[0:05:31] <+silvery_cricket> They hired guys who got holocaust profiteers off scott free, so thats where Activision Blizzard is right now
[0:05:34] <derap41> EA bad
[0:05:34] <kikoeru_san> the Union busting firm to "fix" the internal issues
[0:05:34] <%Wurmspawn> So, how'd you enjoy that off stream firewalker dlc?
[0:05:35] <Cjsquid> blizzard bad? how did that happened?
[0:05:37] <syzmachine> Chris Chan worse

[0:05:46] <%Ynkubus_> GW going through its cycle of shit again
[0:05:48] <%Monkeyweed21> GW continues to exist despite their own best efforts
[0:05:48] <blue6sub6remnant6> @peachy996 Generally, or did something happen?
[0:05:49] <DaKnightWarrior> super bad. needs to die.
[0:05:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Who is Chris Chan

[0:05:56] <+silvery_cricket> @SovPho Yes
[0:06:00] <+diztanc3> @peachy996 Did Chris chan and pat interact lmao
[0:06:01] <dekkitout> Who woulda thought the company run by satan is bad
[0:06:03] <dawarw0lf> Good thing I don’t care about anything from Activ/Blizzard
[0:06:07] <derap41> Pinkertons when?
[0:06:09] <$Futurecity10> @KeiganOfAstora dont worry about it
[0:06:09] <bob900000> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:06:10] <%andrewofbob> It's like a layer of shit appeared over the Blizzard part, and started increasing in volume pressuring the rest of the company
[0:06:10] <peachy996> Y'know what? Nevermind
[0:06:12] <rekinom> but don't worry we're removing the /spit emote from classic wow see we care @PatStaresAt
[0:06:12] <+Repulsion__> Cool room
[0:06:15] <@SoFarFetched> DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE CHRIS CHAN STUFF IN HERE geefPoint
[0:06:18] <%MonkeyTimelord> Pat, is your CPAP machine made by Philips?
[0:06:19] <GuyverTypeL> Bust that union up!
[0:06:19] <%andrewofbob> A volumetric shit compressor, if you will
[0:06:20] <peachy996> Don't worry about it chat
[0:06:21] <@SoFarFetched> That shit needs to be DM'd
[0:06:22] <penitentpendant> "Oops! All Pinkertons!"
[0:06:22] <Dunmarkh> @KeiganOfAstora big sonic the hedgehog fan, did some crime
[0:06:23] <@SoFarFetched> NOT for here
[0:06:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @Ynkubus_ Total War and Vermintide have really improved their image lately so GW had to remind everyone
[0:06:29] <%rDAKODAc> rDAKODAc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey @patstaresat it really is amazing how Activision Blizzard gets worse every day
[0:06:33] <knight_verse> I can't believe I got the message for thise stream literally as I was about to start the final mission in ME3.
[0:06:34] <Cjsquid> yohoho they took a bite gum gum
[0:06:39] <bob900000> how does it keep getting worse!
[0:06:39] <%Ynkubus_> GWs legal team and board without fail dig themselves out to favceplant later
[0:06:49] <dekkitout> This comes out almost every 3 quarters at this rate
[0:06:53] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Also, Plague about to vet a copyright strike from Games Workshop now. RIP Emperor TTS
[0:06:55] <%cvp5127> the damn broke
[0:06:58] <+Mrbaconator> it's assholes all the way down!
[0:07:02] <+DatAsuna> It's funny how riot is spun out of mods for blizzard games and is basically the new blizzard in terms of being hugely successful/unoriginal. And just like blizzard they're also full of scumbags, they're just still also successful.
[0:07:05] <+Wolfstriker121> give it like a week or more and we will see the ceo of blizzard step down
[0:07:05] <derap41> Next time
[0:07:08] <yourliteraldog> Zangeif will Kill
[0:07:08] <%Larry_Q> there is like no non-nefarious reason to not have locks on those doors
[0:07:12] <%ssjklyco> Bigger house
[0:07:16] <%ahomeschooldropout> Reminder Jason Scherier literally enabled this shit by admitting that he had stories and didn't say shit
[0:07:22] <%Wurmspawn> Buy you a NEW bigger titto wife!
[0:07:35] <%ReenMan350> gonna buy her a viking funeral
[0:07:41] <%ssjklyco> Have a space theme funeral
[0:07:45] <GuyverTypeL> Evil world
[0:07:46] <yourliteraldog> Buy new wife with 22 inch rims
[0:07:47] <%Monkeyweed21> Just find the lab that grew Paige and pay them to make another one
[0:07:48] <derap41> E3 always sucks
[0:07:53] <bob900000> which E3?
[0:07:53] <%Ynkubus_> @monkeyweed21 not just the games but Gw just does shit like this every decade
[0:07:54] <%megadblitz> good gief
[0:07:55] <peachy996> videogames suck
[0:08:04] <dekkitout> Back in my day, E3 was just panels of tech demos
[0:08:05] <+Wolfstriker121> WHEN we will see pat as a v-tuber for a day hehe?
[0:08:09] <knight_verse> I mean, if you use anything mafe out of cotton...
[0:08:13] <peachy996> why even bother getting excited about games at all they're all trash
[0:08:13] <OldManDeckardCain> it's like that time james chen and other fuccbois from that arcade TOTALLY didn't know about what that evo guy was doing Kappa
[0:08:13] <%TIME_PUNCHER> The last good E3 was pre Gamecube
[0:08:14] <rosemon5001> would a bell on his neck be a good thing or curse? @PatStaresAt
[0:08:16] <%Ipsenscastle> hey y'all
[0:08:21] <derap41> God Fucking Dammit
[0:08:21] <GuyverTypeL> that is waaay far in time man
[0:08:22] <$Futurecity10> Gamesworkshop is trash, the british were a mistake
[0:08:22] <%ssjklyco> It started sucking when the 7th gen started to scum shit
[0:08:22] <+Axellogic> E3 only accepts professionalism and rape
[0:08:23] <Tennochief> RIP TTS
[0:08:25] <derap41> no Astartes !!
[0:08:29] <+DatAsuna> this just in: corporations aren't your friends
[0:08:32] <rosemon5001> ahhh
[0:08:35] <%idyota> but it would be cute tho
[0:08:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @Ynkubus_ yea every few years GW needs to remind everyone that they're run by stupid evil assholes
[0:08:39] <bob900000> I would rather watch a live stream from home
[0:08:42] <yourliteraldog> Chunky breaths
[0:08:42] <+DatAsuna> if they haven't fucked you yet, they will
[0:08:48] <%shurtal> Mah-onster
[0:08:49] <@SoFarFetched> @derap41 I think they picked up the guy who did astartes so he's doing stuff for them now
[0:08:51] <%megadblitz> Zangief would be a bad horror villain you'd always know where he is
[0:08:52] <stantheman_97> GW being scumbags isn't new. that's been known for decades
[0:08:54] <%Ziegsy> hey, yoshi-p loves me ;;
[0:08:55] <+silvery_cricket> Reminder that Blizzard got pissy because they got asked to play more for a security software because they sexually harassed the chief of operations at the company.

[0:09:08] <%Blackleafx> psaCanada
[0:09:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt We used to put a bell on one of our cats cuz he would play roughly with another cat that was scared of him so it gave him a headstart
[0:09:10] <dekkitout> Yet corporations can be perceived as individuals in court
[0:09:13] <derap41> @SoFarFetched But they're not doing animation now so he's stuck
[0:09:16] <+cermo55> I almost spent money on 40,000k cause of Emperor TTS, and then GW happened
[0:09:20] <%Monkeyweed21> That one fan animation about GW continues to be accurate

[0:22:13] <4DLuvOfLuthy> oh its gonna be super good
[0:22:15] <%Ipsenscastle> honestly Overlord's biggest problem is that its just boring as fuck
[0:22:16] <peachy996> Did I mention I hate Arrival?
[0:22:18] <%KishinGrek> autism is a super power, just watch the Predator
[0:22:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> Its not the worst but its not great

[0:24:01] <dd44dostivei> friday stream over
[0:24:03] <%shurtal> mass effect trying to protect us from mediocre dlc
[0:24:04] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I WON'T
[0:24:04] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @teefpal could be worse. you could be sia and make a movie called "Music."
[0:24:06] <i_chevalier> @teefpal I hope your okay
[0:24:08] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GET BAK HERE
[0:24:09] <dawarw0lf> I seriously don’t think overlord and the autism is that bad
[0:24:18] <CrypticMochi> I thought it was more about the dude being a math savant than autism? Never played or seen it, so I guess I’ll find out
[0:24:19] <+redthebaron> have we done the mass effect war crime dlc or are we doing it today?
[0:24:22] <dd44dostivei> currently deleting youtube uploads
[0:24:24] <%teefpal> @PocketBearIllustrator LUL
[0:24:30] <%teefpal> @i_chevalier its fine
[0:24:35] <%peyodogo> solidarity to all yall folks with autism in the chat, fuck this trainwreck dlc lmao
[0:24:38] <+cermo55> @redthebaron today
[0:24:47] <dekkitout> Somehow manages to delete recycle bin
[0:24:54] <+redthebaron> hell yess
[0:24:57] <peachy996> It's also really boring for the last DLC for ME2 to close with. Yeah Overlord does the autism thing terribly but it's still a fun DLC with a memorable ending
[0:25:01] <GuyverTypeL> "Oh guys, I just deleted the game, oops!"
[0:25:06] <%Dakuu75> ...
[0:25:07] <%KishinGrek> how'd you fix it?
[0:25:08] <%peyodogo> ha ha
[0:25:09] <dekkitout> Good shit
[0:25:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH
[0:25:13] <bob900000> ........
[0:25:14] <+sonofthedeepsouth> HAHAH
[0:25:20] <MiguelNewMexico> wow, is it true today is your 19th birthday? congrats!
[0:25:22] <peachy996> So Yeah Arrival leads into ME3, But it sucks and ME3 sucks with it
[0:25:24] <stantheman_97> overjord
[0:25:24] <%teefpal> I actually liked Overlord at the time, but it was before I got diagnosed.
[0:25:26] <5pencer1001> pat do you feel they should have included pinnacle station in me1 legendary edition even tho it sucks?
[0:25:28] <dawarw0lf> Let’s judge overlord and the autism when we get there
[0:25:30] <GuyverTypeL> Overjord yes
[0:25:38] <+redthebaron> can't leave a single planet unprobed
[0:25:41] <DynzelWashington> I'm playing through these for the first time ever, and did this a couple of weeks ago. I don't think Ive ever hated an NPC more than the doctor in Overlord. Especially as I have an autistic sibling.
[0:25:43] <Nautilaa> have we probed uranus yet Kappa
[0:25:50] <Explodincatz> its never to early to make the same mistake twice
[0:25:50] <peachy996> Ughhhh don't tell me another story about the Shephard
[0:25:51] <+DatAsuna> @peachy996 it has some okay levels but i hate the hammerhead more than the mako
[0:25:53] <dawarw0lf> Get ready to wait 50 hours
[0:25:55] <%Ipsenscastle> you're a starchild
[0:25:55] <GuyverTypeL> yes
[0:25:58] <%KishinGrek> @nautilaa haaaaaaaa
[0:25:59] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt at this stage, you could probably REALLY delete your VODS as an lol at the chat, and make a minimal impact on your gradual building back up
[0:26:00] <+Scevda> !uptime
[0:26:00] <@Moobot> @Scevda I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 26m 18s.
[0:26:01] <+redthebaron> no
[0:26:02] <4DLuvOfLuthy> god the starchild...
[0:26:02] <CosmicApe13> is legendary edition worth it? I do want to replay ME but I also want multiplayer from 3
[0:26:07] <AluxStreams> The difference in writing style between ME2 and ME3 is absolute whiplash.
[0:26:08] <%ahomeschooldropout> I thought it was just the ending but the entirety of the final act of ME3 is just a steaming pile of nonesensical garbage
[0:26:10] <dekkitout> Eh, you could use like 5 more
[0:26:12] <anAngryHamster> Thankfully all of us on the autistic spectrum can feel represented by Symmetra *vomits*
[0:26:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The reincanation of the Emperor of Mankind?
[0:26:13] <GustauveVIII> is pat ready for literally almost no shooting in ME3 as a vanguard?
[0:26:14] <yourliteraldog> It might be useful later better get more
[0:26:16] <tanarath> you don't, Pat
[0:26:17] <%MidnightBurst12> nah, space war is expensive
[0:26:18] <dd44dostivei> catalyst projects itself as someone who is in shepard's mind
[0:26:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Also send GW to the sun
[0:26:20] <+cermo55> there is an data log, forgot where, that mentions an autistic girl, and the overlord guy.
[0:26:28] <fatalistchris> You need more for the suicide mission you did lat week
[0:26:30] <peachy996> @DatAsuna It's definitely the lowest tier of the vehicles. Mako and Nomad were better
[0:26:30] <5pencer1001> pat determined to change the me3 plot into an environmental one by mining out every mineral in the galaxy
[0:26:31] <dawarw0lf> @aluxstreams For the 10% bad it is
[0:26:32] <Nautilaa> wait how does he deplete the entire planet with one probe?
[0:26:33] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Space war is based
[0:26:34] <%machshop> ururururuz
[0:26:41] <%teefpal> It's still a really cool horror themed DLC but it's representation is rough. Plus torturing an autistic person by hooking them up to a machine to "dehumanize" them is chilling
[0:26:46] <%shurtal> so how bad was Firewalker?
[0:26:48] <dekkitout> @Nautilaa Skillz ™️
[0:26:51] <+Scevda> Anyone fill me in, hes done just scanning right?
[0:26:54] <dawarw0lf> Hot take: nomad is the best of the three
[0:26:56] <+Bigbossman91> @Nautilaa mods
[0:26:59] <%Mikewrobe> its the worst
[0:27:00] <%machshop> firewalker is dumb
[0:27:05] <Nautilaa> ah
[0:27:06] <AluxStreams> @dawarw0lf No the whole game you can tell straight away it was written by a different person. Not bad, just very different.
[0:27:08] <%andrewofbob> Did you at least off-screen it?
[0:27:08] <peachy996> You're still going to play the bad tank
[0:27:10] <+DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt you're gonna be forced to use the bad tank in overlord anyway
[0:27:14] <+cermo55> it even souds terrible
[0:27:14] <%machshop> overjord
[0:27:15] <CosmicApe13> Are they going to add multiplayer to ME?
[0:27:16] <%shurtal> ah, i thought you had already did it
[0:27:16] <GustauveVIII> dont do it; it gives you nothing
[0:27:16] <%Monkeyweed21> its shittier mako missions\
[0:27:17] <peachy996> So you can't escape that part
[0:27:33] <+D00msDayDan> the tank is cool but the levels are boring
[0:27:34] <%dooscent> the nomad is good but andromeda maps are more empty and boring than DA:I which is impressive
[0:27:36] <Nautilaa> overlord was the only bit in the entire trilogy i didnt like
[0:27:37] <%teefpal> At least you can pick the good end and save David
[0:27:39] <+Scevda> You should still do it for XP for ME3, ya you got it
[0:27:41] <+DatAsuna> yeah there is no escaping hammerhead
[0:27:43] <5pencer1001> Fire Walk With ME2
[0:27:45] <%Monkeyweed21> and the mako missions sucked to begin with
[0:27:51] <peachy996> "The Sea of Storms" what a cool name
[0:27:51] <dawarw0lf> @aluxstreams That’s fair. I think it’s different but still good. For like 80-90% of it.
[0:27:51] <%machshop> planet knuckles!
[0:27:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> Firewalker has no story and no reward
[0:27:54] <%Wurmspawn> Firewalker is a chain of simple side missions mostly taking place in the hovertank you're going to be using during this chain of missions.
[0:28:00] <%shurtal> i thought that said "Instigate Project Overlord" and i thought YEAH thats a pretty good description
[0:28:11] <%machshop> the dream team
[0:28:15] <+Scevda> 200 saves woot
[0:28:17] <%dooscent> oh wait you use the firewalker in this, right
[0:28:20] <+Shady_Zaku> Wrex.
[0:28:23] <%chance_h> team beep boop
[0:28:28] <peachy996> I don't think Legion has anything to say about this mission, does he?
[0:28:28] <GuyverTypeL> The only thing i remember about overlord is goo
[0:28:30] <+Shady_Zaku> Shephard.
[0:28:33] <%shurtal> PFFT you get the tank before you get the tank
[0:28:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> Bring Lesion btw
[0:28:34] <peachy996> no unique dialogue
[0:28:38] <+cermo55> booooooooooo
[0:28:46] <Laecerelius> Any upgrades here?
[0:28:48] <peachy996> FUCK ARCHER
[0:28:53] <mr_saturday93> Wow twitch tells me now that he's streaming. fuck you to twitch
[0:28:56] <%watts121> VAE VICTUS!
[0:28:58] <%RonaldMcDownload> By gawd, that's gotta be Kane!
[0:28:58] <+redthebaron> oh
[0:29:01] <%machshop> bah gawd
[0:29:02] <dekkitout> The titular?!
[0:29:03] <dawarw0lf> There is a single line of unique dialogue for legion
[0:29:06] <+Scevda> @patstaresat you will later in the mission
[0:29:06] <AluxStreams> Man it's funny watching people stream this and chat just goes "BOOOOO ARCHER YOU STINK BOOOOO"
[0:29:08] <+OneGorillionDollars> FeelsBadMan Legacy of Kain
[0:29:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> less verbose
[0:29:10] <%andrewofbob> Oh, so not Kane from Titanfall 2
[0:29:10] <+RowenCleric> god I love his voice acting
[0:29:14] <SovPho> @mr_saturday93 he literally just started playing like 5 minutes ago, you haven't missed anything
[0:29:17] <fatalistchris> Gavin, where are you Gaviiin?
[0:29:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> WHERE IS THE SHAKESPEREAN QUOTES
[0:29:19] <+cermo55> worst
[0:29:20] <5pencer1001> does that mean he is also the bad guy from dead space 3?
[0:29:23] <peachy996> Ah okay thanks dawarw0lf
[0:29:23] <%machshop> offbrand Sean Bean
[0:29:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> KAIN WHERE IS RAZIEL
[0:29:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[0:29:36] <+Bigbossman91> @5pencer1001 yes
[0:29:39] <GuyverTypeL> @patstaresat upgrades list?
[0:29:40] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Luxord?
[0:29:48] <peachy996> This facility gives me multiplayer flashbacks
[0:29:51] <%teefpal> I will say going back to overlord is like seeing your anxiety about not being seen as human and self-hatred at your "robotic" behaviors be put front and center. I don't mind it as a horror thing, personally, but im a bit of a machoist
[0:29:53] <%jillpilled> @5pencer1001 I'm glad I can't remember Dead Space 3
[0:29:53] <mr_saturday93> @sovpho oh good normally it's like 30 mins of pre stream before he plays so I assumed he was further ahead
[0:29:59] <OldManDeckardCain> "I have locked myself in a computer room, there are activision blizzard employees on the loose!"
[0:30:00] <fatalistchris> Gavin Aaacha
[0:30:05] <AluxStreams> @PocketBearIllustrator pls I'm not ready
[0:30:06] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 But legion doesn’t say it because that costs money
[0:30:09] <@BigNaturalMan59> BigNaturalMan59 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months, currently on a 55 month streak! 
[0:30:10] <%maenos2> Oh boy, overlord!
[0:30:10] <Mattais88> Go back and break the glass
[0:30:15] <+redthebaron> really sounding like a villain on that recording
[0:30:16] <5pencer1001> has anyone on the ME universe not bypassed safety protocols?
[0:30:20] <%Ziegsy> @watts121 VAE VICTIS!!
[0:30:20] <%teefpal> Then again I LOVE horror games, especially silent hill and system shock
[0:30:20] <yourliteraldog> Your not getting your hands on my recreational nuclear ordinance
[0:30:29] <peachy996> You can hear it
[0:30:32] <mr_saturday93> "Please make it stop"
[0:30:35] <Nautilaa> omg this sound is gonna fuck up my sleep tonight 4Head
[0:30:35] <stantheman_97> oh hey it's shodan
[0:30:36] <+D00msDayDan> "him"
[0:30:37] <%maenos2> I like how they say its unintelligble but you cvan TOTALLY hear it
[0:30:38] <%teefpal> @5pencer1001 if you haven't have you really lived?
[0:30:39] <peachy996> I love that detail
[0:30:41] <+cermo55> VI you say???
[0:30:41] <%chance_h> god i forgot how much i hate the robot noise
[0:31:03] <peachy996> You don't know what he's saying until the end but when you replay the mission you can hear him clear as day
[0:31:08] <+DatAsuna> This is basically that one swtor flashpoint, except that didn't have the gross autism stuff
[0:31:12] <+redthebaron> it couldn't be a real ai they would never do it
[0:31:15] <5pencer1001> do security protocols even exist?
[0:31:21] <%CatastropheCorvid> Yo Pat. How's stream so far?
[0:31:37] <+Scevda> @datasuna THINK AGAIN!
[0:31:39] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat Don't forget your upgrades guide.

[0:32:22] <dawarw0lf> This and lotsb both have very similar themes
[0:32:27] <BallerSwagBro9k> This DLC reminds me of Prey
[0:32:29] <%teefpal> This track is so fucking good
[0:32:33] <+DatAsuna> @Scevda pretty sure mentor was an actual AI and not related to autism
[0:32:34] <SovPho> are you that bored with the combat at this point?
[0:32:34] <+Scevda> @patstaresat ITEM GUIDE PAT

[0:36:30] <%Dakuu75> that actually sounds a lot like my pops
[0:36:34] <anAngryHamster> That story about Pat's dad getting his finger shoved into his hand is still too difficult for me to process
[0:36:38] <+unhuggable1> @yourliteraldog true
[0:36:39] <BallerSwagBro9k> Paige Dad vs Pat Dad boxing when?

[0:38:23] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> It's all the lead in the pipes

[0:38:26] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Survivorship bias. All the weak ones died

[0:39:23] <%MonkeyTimelord> MonkeyTimelord subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Pat. Is your CPAP machine made by Philips? Apparently, some models have been recalled due to risk of respiratory illness and cancer. Sound dampening foam in the device breaks down and is inhaled by the user. I hope this doesn't affect you.

[0:39:27] <%TIME_PUNCHER> this isn't Predator, Pat
[0:39:31] <stantheman_97> virtual autism
[0:39:32] <%megadblitz> old people are tougher because they didn't have a choice and LOVED war. we younger folk hate war
[0:39:32] <dd44dostivei> old people ruined the economy by providing us with better lives than their own
[0:39:33] <5pencer1001> powered by autism and body horror
[0:39:33] <OldManDeckardCain> that predator is probably super jelly rn
[0:39:35] <Virokwet> how could itt be

[0:39:55] <%ItalianWaifu> @ape_hawk LUL
[0:40:01] <%Treuan> I hate them
[0:40:01] <Mattais88> Wait, did Predator lie to me?
[0:40:02] <%DrTomT18> savantism is a thing but I don't think it let's you talk to robots
[0:40:02] <TrollKing96> When are you not facetious?
[0:40:02] <%JohnAtDawn> Fuck off Pat
[0:40:06] <+Peacefrog7> what if autism made you so smart you could talk to robots

[0:40:15] <+Axellogic> Level me up please
[0:40:18] <dawarw0lf> Let’s wait until it says what causes the problem before writing it off
[0:40:18] <%PocketBearIllustrator> oh, yeah. you can even get more autistic if you get vaccinations. :P
[0:40:19] <%lumporr> a real work of aut
[0:40:20] <mr_saturday93> I has OCD and anxiety does that mean I have super powers?
[0:40:20] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Did Bruce Willis adopt them after they cracked NSA code
[0:40:22] <%General_Terro> i got fucking jipped cuz my super power is not being able to sleep
[0:40:22] <yourliteraldog> oof
[0:40:22] <%teefpal> lol you prick
[0:40:23] <peachy996> What started that trend in fiction anyway? was it Rain Man?
[0:40:25] <%demiiluna> It's great I have the power to never know if everyone I like hates me because I'm unintentionally offending them.
[0:40:27] <tanarath> It sucks
[0:40:30] <+senfood> LUL
[0:40:31] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'm surviving with them. :P
[0:40:31] <Dunmarkh> @JohnAtDawn you don't know what this dlc is about?
[0:40:32] <stantheman_97> my autistic friends tells me is a good fun time with no downsides
[0:40:33] <%shurtal> Human or otherwise
[0:40:33] <zekana> not sure if i have autism but i have cripling social anxiety thats comes about randomly.
[0:40:34] <%Puhff> Paige the Predator
[0:40:36] <peachy996> Is this all Rain Man's Fault?
[0:40:41] <$sleepystardewfarmer> I wish I had super powers lol
[0:40:41] <%Torus1025> I wish I had the cool autism powers instead of the dumb adhd ones :(
[0:40:42] <%rDAKODAc> Didn’t help me with calculus that’s for damn sure @patstaresat
[0:40:42] <%TIME_PUNCHER> hey everyone, remember MERCURY RISING
[0:40:43] <+redthebaron> my juice?
[0:40:46] <anAngryHamster> My superpower is stammering and awkward interjections
[0:40:49] <%ainzhelm> Bringing a whole new meaning to the term Weaponized Autism
[0:40:50] <%teefpal> @demiiluna wow same here, we should team up
[0:40:50] <%Puhff> he wants ur bones
[0:40:51] <fatalistchris> It was Aimee Simposon
[0:40:55] <%idyota> savant syndrome is a real thing, but not all autistic people have it.
[0:40:56] <%megadblitz> "faseesious?" puh-LEASE I don't even know how to spell the word
[0:40:57] <ape_hawk> DAMN YOU SEAN PENN!
[0:40:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @TIME_PUNCHER lol no
[0:41:03] <%ItalianWaifu> Rain man was the Magneto of his time
[0:41:05] <%lumporr> that is one weird shotgun
[0:41:06] <%Solid_Stro> The camera shake is killing me doodSick
[0:41:16] <+battle_of_the_meat> Aliens are gonna steal out autism.
[0:41:17] <dawarw0lf> You know this dlc would be bad if it was autism=magical powers
[0:41:17] <+DatAsuna> the secret to being high functioning autistic is realising that neurotypical folks don't actually understand it that much better, they just don't worry about it.
[0:41:17] <%DrTomT18> there is a theory that ADD is a generic hold over from when we were hunter gathererz
[0:41:20] <%ElkRiverDog> @time_puncher unfortunately yes
[0:41:21] <yourliteraldog> angry howl
[0:41:23] <%teefpal> BIG SHAKE for BIG DAMAGE
[0:41:24] <ezlo_86> so many vomiting geth noises
[0:41:37] <dekkitout> Screenshake- let me get my painkillers. (No seriously)
[0:41:40] <%teefpal> I do like the scale of the map in this
[0:41:55] <peachy996> Why did you draw your gun
[0:41:58] <fatalistchris> @datasuna nailed it
[0:41:59] <%ainzhelm> I actually wonder what the first instance of the super powered autism trope
[0:42:01] <peachy996> Never made sense lol
[0:42:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat didn't you know that vaccines giving autism is a nefarious plot to throw the world into chaos by giving everyone super powers
[0:42:09] <+Peacefrog7> LOL
[0:42:11] <%AzureGale> When did Shepard turn into Nathan Drake
[0:42:12] <%teefpal> None of the companions having voice acting is really throwing me off
[0:42:25] <tanarath> SOLVED THE PROBLEM
[0:42:25] <%teefpal> Oh SURE Archer
[0:42:27] <5pencer1001> the ME2 dlc writing is really overwrought and tropey at times
[0:42:29] <%lumporr> that guy sounds evil
[0:42:29] <mr_saturday93> Why'd they make shep silent for the first 20 mins is odd to me
[0:42:37] <AthenaAegis> For England Shepard? No, for me. Kappa
[0:42:37] <+senfood> His voice, aw yeah
[0:42:39] <+AmericanSkidd> Yeah I can say cryptic shit too
[0:42:41] <5pencer1001> shepard goes out of his way to make unearned quips
[0:42:42] <peachy996> Oh you think it's throwing you off they don't talk? Look forward to Arrival
[0:42:44] <%AzureGale> THAT'S THE ENDING!?
[0:42:50] <%Movemeister> I for one welcome our new superpowered society
[0:42:51] <%Puhff> god your characters looks like SHIT
[0:42:56] <+Peacefrog7> @lumporr naaaahhhhh he's a goooood guy
[0:42:59] <%machshop> YOU DON'T SAY?
[0:43:00] <+cermo55> A ssuper mind!!!
[0:43:04] <zekana> pat shepard is still creepy to me, specially upclose
[0:43:13] <alroy900> well i'm better than the average person at math and some other shits but I sounds like a cold apathethic asshole most of the time to other people, is that my super power?
[0:43:16] <dawarw0lf> Yeah legion
[0:43:17] <%PocketBearIllustrator> so, is ME2 lacking in beard options?
[0:43:18] <fatalistchris> FOR MI6 SHERPERD
[0:43:23] <%teefpal> Legion makes Project Overlord 100% pointless
[0:43:24] <+Peacefrog7> @lumporr making fun of his writing not you friend
[0:43:25] <+DatAsuna> @5pencer1001 the main story is very much that too, it just has better cinematography to make people gloss over it
[0:43:29] <+cermo55> a virus you say??
[0:43:35] <peachy996> Dr. Gavin Archer is the scummiest scientist scumfuck that ever scummed
[0:43:44] <+D00msDayDan> autism is TOO powerful
[0:43:44] <AluxStreams> Is that Aria's couch?
[0:43:46] <+cermo55> clearly evil
[0:43:50] <tanarath> The Internet og Things, that's how
[0:43:52] <%Puhff> You know, I'm starting to think this game isn't good.
[0:43:53] <%machshop> @PocketBearIllustrator the whole trilogy is kinda light on the facial hair
[0:43:56] <AmuserName> SPACE Y2K LUL
[0:43:59] <%ItalianWaifu> he'd just get distracted by all the space porn
[0:44:00] <dekkitout> Skynet again?
[0:44:04] <%teefpal> So its Lawnmower Man
[0:44:05] <+Peacefrog7> yes you could
[0:44:07] <%Puhff> Like, there's great characters and a cool world
[0:44:09] <+DatAsuna> @peachy996 that only makes him an average cerberus guy
[0:44:09] <%Dakuu75> Just download Nortan. you'll be fine Kappa
[0:44:12] <+cermo55> and whose fault is that?
[0:44:14] <%ainzhelm> SKYNET
[0:44:18] <wibbwobbler> Actually never played this!
[0:44:21] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @machshop feckin lame sauce.
[0:44:21] <mr_saturday93> Dav? who now?
[0:44:21] <Dunmarkh> nice ass legion
[0:44:26] <GuyverTypeL> he cheeking those legzzzz
[0:44:34] <5pencer1001> is there a cerberus cell that hasnt failed and gotten everyone killed?
[0:44:36] <HollowMan190> hate this dlc
[0:44:36] <dawarw0lf> It works like a video game
[0:44:38] <+DatAsuna> 3 huh?
[0:44:40] <yourliteraldog> Yeah dehumanize the AI that is an excllent idea
[0:44:41] <+senfood> it is so weird having Legion move the bodies.
[0:44:50] <%Puhff> but the ending only has one right answer and almost all the sidestuff is either a single firefight in a room or...this stuff
[0:44:55] <knight_verse> Legion is stealing the bodies to take their flesh.
[0:45:01] <AluxStreams> omg I didn't know lol
[0:45:03] <%teefpal> @5pencer1001 I was gonna say Shepard's but we all know what happens in ME3
[0:45:06] <+redthebaron> robot racism baby
[0:45:13] <+AmericanSkidd> its probably fine fuck it
[0:45:16] <+Based_Moose> Bros support bros
[0:45:27] <HollowMan190> YOU BROUGHT HIM HERE?!
[0:45:30] <yourliteraldog> Geth do not infiltrate
[0:45:40] <fatalistchris> Remeber, MI6 is open to reason
[0:45:42] <+cermo55> no he didnt
[0:45:45] <%Puhff> As if this dude had a choice LUL
[0:45:50] <peachy996> Oh he Volunteered? That's fine then
[0:45:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> "volunteerd'
[0:45:55] <anAngryHamster> Hermes Conrad station
[0:46:00] <5pencer1001> @5pencer1001 But the very first thing to happen in ME2 is the shepard cell all dying save 3 people
[0:46:01] <+cermo55> worst guardian/brother
[0:46:05] <+DatAsuna> he knew what he was getting into
[0:46:06] <tanarath> T H E O R E T I C A L L Y
[0:46:16] <Madinki> Legion existing make this ENTIRE project POINTLESS
[0:46:26] <%lumporr> has "turn _______ into a weapon" EVER worked? EVER?
[0:46:29] <%AzureGale> "ambitious"
[0:46:32] <Mattais88> Except for everyone you killed trying to do it
[0:46:34] <+cermo55> Hey legion what do think of this Plan?
[0:46:34] <GuyverTypeL> The ultimate bio weapon!
[0:46:36] <peachy996> I almost feel bad for anyone watching the stream that never played this before. We're spoiling the shit on minute 1 LUL
[0:46:37] <%teefpal> Archer, turn your head to the right 90 degrees
[0:46:37] <dekkitout> I do not believe you
[0:46:38] <yourliteraldog> Shouldn't this guy be a quarian
[0:46:42] <mr_saturday93> SCREAMING
[0:46:43] <%TIME_PUNCHER> he wanted to use religion to return the geth to slavery
[0:46:47] <knight_verse> Stupid is on brand for Cerberus.
[0:46:53] <+critikal_bit> You can win by NOT stirring up shit with the Geth
[0:46:57] <Dunmarkh> @yourliteraldog this is a cerberus project
[0:46:57] <SaltyAzteca> Oh crap how much did I miss chat?
[0:47:00] <peachy996> Hammerhead Ho
[0:47:02] <AluxStreams> Time to fly the paper plane.
[0:47:03] <+RowenCleric> this guy is a sussy baka
[0:47:04] <%PocketBearIllustrator> is it just me, or is the facial animations still off in the Legendary Edition? I mean, better than Andromeda, but still.
[0:47:05] <Mattais88> This Archer makes Sterling Archer look like a genius
[0:47:07] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 I think everyone trying to make Pat hate it and others
[0:47:11] <+cermo55> worst sound incoming
[0:47:18] <%DrTomT18> if you take Legion to meet the council, they still won't believe you. it's fucking amazing lmao
[0:47:23] <Flame_Water> Overlord and Arrival are the 2 most godly missions iv ever played in my life
[0:47:23] <GuyverTypeL> @saltyazteca early part of the overlord dlc
[0:47:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> why is it called a hammer head when it looks like a manta ray
[0:47:31] <+DatAsuna> I wonder if they fixed the texture streaming for LE
[0:47:35] <mr_saturday93> Hammerhead is a glass Cannon if I remember right
[0:47:38] <%watts121> Thought you escaped the tank didn't you dumbass!
[0:47:38] <peachy996> @dawarw0lf I love this DLC, behind LOTSB of course.
[0:47:40] <SaltyAzteca> WHAT
[0:47:40] <%teefpal> @PocketBearIllustrator It was the 360 era. Facial animation is almost nonexistent
[0:47:43] <yourliteraldog> That looks like it feels like slippery shit
[0:47:43] <%dooscent> this is the ship you do firewalker missions with
[0:47:44] <GustauveVIII> that's a digging button
[0:47:44] <RedSqurrl> mineral grabber thingy
[0:47:44] <+tinytinykittycat> mako > hammerhead
[0:47:46] <Mattais88> drill for presents
[0:47:46] <%AzureGale> What is that four-digit number
[0:47:46] <+cermo55> scanner, sounds terrible
[0:47:47] <%Blackleafx> vroom vroom
[0:47:47] <+redthebaron> pretty
[0:47:47] <+unhuggable1> oh god its the worst sound ever
[0:47:47] <knight_verse> Pat's flying his imaginary ship. Kappa
[0:47:48] <SaltyAzteca> MY EARS
[0:47:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> It digs up shit
[0:47:54] <dekkitout> Why are your hazard lights tripping
[0:47:55] <%Wurmspawn> That's the scanning feature of the hammerhead for picking up resources on the ground.
[0:47:57] <peachy996> I wish we got areas like this in Andromeda
[0:47:59] <+D00msDayDan> @PocketBearIllustrator unless you ran on source
[0:48:00] <dawarw0lf> Pat you probably should have played the first firewalker
[0:48:01] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "We wanted to create a Viral Robo Messiah to subjugate artificial life, it's ethical."
[0:48:01] <%JamesCorck> Mako >>>> Hammerhead
[0:48:02] <+redthebaron> i like the hovertech
[0:48:02] <5pencer1001> its even got a crazy taxi arrow
[0:48:03] <+DatAsuna> on 360/PS3 the hammerhead levels had a big problem with the floors just having awful LOD pop in
[0:48:05] <%machshop> note taken
[0:48:05] <%cvp5127> looks like anthem
[0:48:08] <%AzureGale> nyannMegalul
[0:48:09] <%andrewofbob> Legion is like IDGAF
[0:48:09] <%JamesCorck> This fucking part is so pandering, holyshit.
[0:48:09] <ape_hawk> look, its the mako but worse!
[0:48:10] <artoflec> the scanner is bugged in this version, it didnt used to sound that terrible
[0:48:11] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @teefpal fair point.
[0:48:13] <SaltyAzteca> @GuyverTypeL Thanks bud, I was playing DMC2 cuz I hate myself Kappa b
[0:48:18] <%Monkeyweed21> the hammerhead
[0:48:19] <+AmericanSkidd> hammerhead sucks mako for life
[0:48:20] <%JamesCorck> Oh look it's a pretty view, shut up! I don't care!
[0:48:22] <+DatAsuna> Nomad > Mako > Hammerhead
[0:48:22] <stantheman_97> the hammerhead looks rad
[0:48:23] <%maenos2> omg it does kinda look like anthem
[0:48:23] <+unhuggable1> yeah the scanner is bugged as fuck
[0:48:24] <%teefpal> Damn this looks really nice for an upscaled 360 game
[0:48:27] <%lumporr> damn that thing can move
[0:48:29] <karl_rex> Look at this skybox we made it took us a long time
[0:48:32] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt There are collectibles you can dig up in Overlord in the Mako. They don't give you anything except an achievement.
[0:48:38] <TourettesPlays> Press B To TransgenderPride
[0:48:45] <yourliteraldog> MAKO is my first and only love
[0:48:48] <%teefpal> B
[0:48:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> nooooooooo
[0:48:48] <+D00msDayDan> BIOWARE MAGIC
[0:48:49] <5pencer1001> it looks like the boring parts of pandora
[0:48:51] <peachy996> Nomad controls better but MAko has GUNS so I'd put them equal
[0:48:53] <%machshop> robots having a panic attack
[0:48:55] <mr_saturday93> except this dlc is finished
[0:48:57] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @d00msdaydan ooh, yeah. some of the facial animations in some source games were on point.
[0:48:57] <dawarw0lf> @gustauveviii An achievement that’s not in le edition
[0:48:58] <GustauveVIII> hammerhead ehhhh
[0:49:00] <%Puhff> yeah these firewalker things suck ass
[0:49:01] <%maenos2> the gigaboots guys noticed that anthem clealry had some dragon age stuff in it so
[0:49:03] <%maenos2> wouldn't surprise me
[0:49:05] <+redthebaron> murdered those robots
[0:49:07] <+RenoDeGeneric> Shoot them with this hovercraft
[0:49:08] <peachy996> Nomad+Mako> HammerHead
[0:49:16] <+Dova573> Man as someone who never touched the me2 dlc, I'm mad this stuff was locked away in paid dlc
[0:49:22] <%andrewofbob> Why are all the robots green? Did we hit synthesis ending early?
[0:49:23] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Hammerhead is the name of a Tau gunship. The more you know
[0:49:25] <+Bigbossman91> @GustauveVIII they removed that achievement in the LE
[0:49:35] <Mattais88> theres a boost to on one of the triggers
[0:49:36] <+AmericanSkidd> touch it
[0:49:39] <GustauveVIII> yeah thats pretty terrible
[0:49:42] <knight_verse> Now go pmay in the lava Pat.

[0:50:37] <%chance_h> @andrewofbob Is the synthesis option powered by autism? find out in mass effect 4... oh wait
[0:50:37] <dd44dostivei> look at this video game shit
[0:50:40] <+redthebaron> it is a setpiece pat
[0:50:47] <+DatAsuna> what IS the point?
[0:50:51] <SaltyAzteca> That noise is awful
[0:50:53] <+AmericanSkidd> its light because the hammerhead is made out of tissue paper
[0:50:54] <TourettesPlays> yea! Resources we dont need!
[0:50:57] <%machshop> what a great sound
[0:50:58] <yourliteraldog> The crisp and crunchy audio
[0:51:00] <%ahomeschooldropout> that is the worst noise ever
[0:51:01] <AluxStreams> The noise is bugged.
[0:51:01] <%TIME_PUNCHER> But why the VI Lawnmower Man take control of the Hammerhead
[0:51:03] <+cermo55> yup
[0:51:06] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:51:08] <+D00msDayDan> now imagine if you had to do that 50 times
[0:51:12] <stantheman_97> why is the noise so bad
[0:51:13] <artoflec> i cant believe they havent fixed that yet

[0:52:20] <%chance_h> best DLC by far lol
[0:52:20] <knight_verse> Bruh.
[0:52:20] <%teefpal> This is a video game alright
[0:52:26] <+AmericanSkidd> this is what we came to see
[0:52:27] <+redthebaron> CLASSIC
[0:52:31] <+DatAsuna> don't cum too soon pat
[0:52:42] <%JamesCorck> YOu know what this game needed? Platforming! Of course.
[0:52:44] <+probably_facetious> @dakuu75 He plays to entertain, not to be *good*
[0:52:51] <%watts121> Didn't this come out before Shadow Broker?
[0:52:52] <%JamesCorck> Overlord came out before Shadow Broker.
[0:52:53] <%ahomeschooldropout> Arrival isn't THAT bad
[0:52:53] <+unhuggable1> firewalker is so dumb
[0:52:54] <peachy996> Actually Overlord was before LotSB
[0:52:55] <+AmericanSkidd> overlord came before shadow broker
[0:52:59] <%Ipsenscastle> Overlord was before Shadow Broker I think
[0:52:59] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt What about Arrival
[0:53:00] <mighty_fine_trousers> Wait did Pat do Arrival already?
[0:53:01] <%JamesCorck> Arrival was the last DLC for ME2.
[0:53:03] <%Treuan> Pat...
[0:53:05] <metalsiren31> pvpThink
[0:53:07] <dawarw0lf> The hammerhead sucking is worth it for the argument in 3 between Cortez and James
[0:53:08] <yourliteraldog> pure skill
[0:53:11] <%weissguard> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:53:11] <%dooscent> yeah overlord was first
[0:53:13] <mr_saturday93> Really?
[0:53:14] <Dunmarkh> @mighty_fine_trousers no
[0:53:16] <+DatAsuna> Yes overlord was before shadow broker
[0:53:19] <+DatAsuna> #crazytalk
[0:53:21] <+probably_facetious> Hell yeah spite skill
[0:53:22] <BallerSwagBro9k> Sure Patty sure Kappa
[0:53:23] <tanarath> @patstaresat shadow broker was 2nd to last & arrival was last
[0:53:23] <5pencer1001> i think me2 and da2 dlc development has severe overlap because there are some major similarities
[0:53:31] <dd44dostivei> it's no use illusive man, i have the high ground
[0:53:33] <%PocketBearIllustrator> ya did it.
[0:53:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Overlord was before Shadow Broker
[0:53:35] <+rafaelba93> everytime i thin of mass effect i think of ship plataforming
[0:53:36] <%JamesCorck> Is that mind goblins?
[0:53:39] <%teefpal> It was Overlord -> Shadow Broker -> Arrival
[0:53:50] <rekinom> The Miles Davis of video games
[0:53:54] <+AmericanSkidd> at least the combat theme is good
[0:53:55] <crazy_riggs> This is still my favorite DLC
[0:53:55] <knight_verse> @teefpal yep
[0:53:57] <Nautilaa> has he beaten the main story?
[0:54:07] <+Shady_Zaku> I love how the entire chat collectively needed to have an "Um AKTCHUALLY" moment lol
[0:54:10] <+critikal_bit> Overlord got some nice tunes ngl
[0:54:13] <+DatAsuna> One of the few parts of combat andromeda made worse was the melee
[0:54:15] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Aw, sweet. just like in NieR Automata. :P
[0:54:18] <dawarw0lf> Ready for a jump scare
[0:54:25] <knight_verse> @nautilaa he did the main story before the dlcs... for some ungodly reason.
[0:54:27] <GustauveVIII> in ME3 shotguns are optional on a vanguard
[0:54:45] <5pencer1001> overlord was launch dlc i thought
[0:54:47] <Nautilaa> preposterous D: @knight_verse
[0:54:47] <$KnivesEve> spoopy
[0:54:49] <GustauveVIII> never liked shotguns in 3
[0:54:52] <5pencer1001> project 10 dollar?
[0:54:59] <%Ziegsy> this isnt gonna be some nier two brothers shit is it?
[0:55:01] <mr_saturday93> MANLY NOISE
[0:55:01] <%teefpal> @knight_verse Why wouldn't you?
[0:55:01] <+DatAsuna> @GustauveVIII I mean in ME3 guns are optional period
[0:55:08] <dawarw0lf> @datasuna That and whatever they did to the netcode because it was baaad in multiplayer
[0:55:09] <peachy996> In ME3 with the right setup for Vanguard, Guns are just decoration
[0:55:23] <peachy996> But I loved the Piranha in ME3 anyway
[0:55:25] <+Shoosler> just gonna send it
[0:55:36] <knight_verse> @teefpal Because outside of Arrival the others take place BEFORE the suicide mission
[0:55:36] <+AmericanSkidd> classic
[0:55:36] <SaltyAzteca> HOPSCOTCH...OF DOOM!
[0:55:39] <mr_saturday93> Lol
[0:55:41] <+senfood> Living the meme.
[0:55:45] <+D00msDayDan> "I am a genius! Oh no!"
[0:55:47] <%teefpal> clutch
[0:55:49] <GustauveVIII> @GustauveVIII that's true, but doesnt it require you to equip at least one gun?
[0:55:51] <+Shady_Zaku> You're not...a geeenius
[0:55:55] <mr_saturday93> crazy talk grows in power
[0:55:58] <%Treuan> You felt that secret
[0:55:58] <%Movemeister> You’re not… a genius
[0:56:02] <dd44dostivei> firewalk with me tank
[0:56:07] <Nautilaa> isnt lotsb also played after the story? @knight_verse
[0:56:09] <%Blackleafx> BRRRRRR
[0:56:11] <dawarw0lf> That noise is a bug definitely
[0:56:21] <%teefpal> @knight_verse I don't think it's hard canon either way except for arrival
[0:56:22] <5pencer1001> bioware loves to include no sequel hooks in the main plot but make a dlc that has all the sequel hooks
[0:56:23] <%machshop> i hope whoever made that noise has suffered considerably in life
[0:56:24] <knight_verse> @nautilaa No.
[0:56:26] <dawarw0lf> It’s only meant to happen when you faul
[0:56:30] <%ChrisPlaysThing> ChrisPlaysThing subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 27 month streak! Genius Pat plays The Floor is Lava: Frogger Edition
[0:56:31] <peachy996> Be quiet you awful man
[0:56:38] <yourliteraldog> Wow this looks fucking stupif
[0:56:40] <dd44dostivei> the new framerate is what bugs the noise
[0:56:44] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> is that an rc ship?
[0:56:45] <+rafaelba93> vehicle plataforming is so mass effect right?
[0:56:46] <%machshop> BBS
[0:56:47] <%Ipsenscastle> be quiet you awful, awful man
[0:56:48] <+cermo55> Imagine if mass effect 4 has actually good vehicles
[0:56:48] <SaltyAzteca> Egg Shepat
[0:56:54] <knight_verse> @nautilaa LotSB and Overlord are still missions you are doing FOR Cerberus.
[0:56:56] <%chance_h> B e a utiful
[0:57:09] <dawarw0lf> @cermo55 It should because andromeda did
[0:57:10] <crazy_riggs> This is Pat in a world where he never played videogames
[0:57:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> I'm jealous of every sheperd that gets to call Tali their wife
[0:57:16] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> @cermo55 while we're at it, imagine if jesus christ himself returns to suck all our dicks, if we're in fantasy land
[0:57:17] <peachy996> I'm still amused that they improved the Mako but managed to make the Hammerhead worse
[0:57:19] <%shurtal> Your Shepherd looks like Bill Dautreave from King of the Hill
[0:57:24] <%teefpal> @5pencer1001 Dragon Age Inquisition had a really good DLC, I just think Bioware can't handle large-scale projects.
[0:57:32] <%watts121> Hell in ME3 you won't even need to fire a bullet if you play Vanguard.
[0:57:37] <+tinytinykittycat> why aim when you can magic?
[0:57:39] <%chance_h> @shurtal The Billdozer!
[0:57:44] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> do backseaters get banned, or do yo ujust get muted
[0:57:47] <Nautilaa> yeah i remember something was off when i did it after the game. i wonder why most guids say to play it after the story @knight_verse
[0:57:55] <SaltyAzteca> Yes considering
[0:57:55] <%Ipsenscastle> yeah
[0:57:56] <+cermo55> @dawarw0lf how where they?
[0:57:56] <%robosqueeb> yeah
[0:58:00] <peachy996> I think Bioware can handle large scale projects but it HAS to be all hands on deck
[0:58:00] <$Futurecity10> and no one owns a fucking PS5
[0:58:01] <ExpressNode> Because no one has a PS5
[0:58:02] <%Ipsenscastle> exactly
[0:58:02] <%NateyBeak> also no one has a ps5
[0:58:04] <AluxStreams> If Returnal was a PS4 game as well it would have cracked 1 million.
[0:58:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> it SUCKED
[0:58:06] <knight_verse> @crazy_riggs But he still wiki'd them for some reason.
[0:58:08] <%watts121> You dare talk bad about Max's game of the year?
[0:58:08] <%Vyskus> I didn't even know there where that many PS5's out in the wild
[0:58:12] <%Monkeyweed21> its PS5 exclusive
[0:58:12] <SaltyAzteca> 70 bucks AND PS5
[0:58:12] <+DenpaDev> nah it was just more doom, we had a doom
[0:58:13] <%andrewofbob> That's $3.5M
[0:58:14] <dekkitout> PS5's aren't real
[0:58:16] <+senfood> Imagine not knowing how to aim because you spent the whole game being the bullet.
[0:58:18] <+battle_of_the_meat> That game is fucking great
[0:58:19] <peachy996> No splitting the teams off
[0:58:19] <+Dova573> 70 dollars k
[0:58:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Just make Game Good, why is that so hard? Kappa
[0:58:24] <+ScrapKingKeita> also its a roguelike with 7 hour runs and an ending that's kind of obvious if you know Jacob's Ladder!
[0:58:26] <SaltyAzteca> If only it came out for PC too
[0:58:26] <5pencer1001> Patrick Dauterive
[0:58:29] <SaltyAzteca> OH WELL
[0:58:31] <mr_saturday93> Returnal isn't bad just 70 bucks is bs
[0:58:32] <%ssjklyco> They didn't receive any RETURNAL on their investment .
[0:58:33] <%Puhff> yeah it sucks im
[0:58:34] <%rDAKODAc> I liked Returnal
[0:58:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> THAT NECK
[0:58:36] <%Puhff> imo*
[0:58:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> WHAT THAT NECK DO?
[0:58:40] <%shurtal> is he a Decendent of Shaun Archer from Face/Off?
[0:58:40] <Dunmarkh> he angy
[0:58:41] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'm still gonna wait for a PS5 slim/Pro.
[0:58:42] <%cvp5127> shodan?
[0:58:42] <+AmericanSkidd> his head went nuts
[0:58:42] <%teefpal> spoopy
[0:58:44] <+tinytinykittycat> robo fart
[0:58:44] <SaltyAzteca> Is that Val?
[0:58:47] <+vaderxyz1970> IS IT A GHOST IN THE SHELL
[0:58:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> HIS NECK WENT NO BONES
[0:58:48] <%Blackleafx> hi tabuu?
[0:58:49] <%YakumoYomi> Oh, are we doing Overlord now?
[0:58:50] <GuyverTypeL> BRRRRRRRRR
[0:58:50] <%Puhff> it's just a shittier Control
[0:58:52] <+Shoosler> asmr brraps
[0:58:53] <luftraumm1> maybe that's the reason we're never had a AAA roguelike
[0:58:53] <+senfood> I'd play Returnal on my PS5. IF I HAD ONE.
[0:58:54] <crazy_riggs> Kinda hard to miss
[0:58:54] <%chance_h> *Angry toaster noises*
[0:59:00] <Laecerelius> It's dem computahs!
[0:59:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> I can't believe the VI imported him to Unity
[0:59:07] <AluxStreams> I just saw you wigging out and the face you made spooked me lol
[0:59:11] <+Dova573> at least is currently on sale for 49
[0:59:14] <SaltyAzteca> This fuckin guy Kappa
[0:59:15] <+DatAsuna> what's a PS5?
[0:59:19] <+DatAsuna> sounds made up
[0:59:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> Ummmm
[0:59:25] <Nautilaa> i remember after finishing this dlc i went to bed with a headache from that noise NotLikeThis
[0:59:26] <+vaderxyz1970> you got 2
[0:59:26] <mr_saturday93> Pat....
[0:59:27] <dekkitout> Right
[0:59:33] <Daxalog> The PS5 does not exist
[0:59:35] <dawarw0lf> @cermo55 The nomad is what the mako should have been
[0:59:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Gotta wait for 2023
[0:59:35] <%robosqueeb> didn't you get like, multiple?
[0:59:41] <peachy996> I'm glad I never wasted money on a ps5 this early
[0:59:43] <%watts121> PS5 is a social experiment.
[0:59:43] <luftraumm1> that's also a very important question, nobody has a ps5 so nobody is gonna buy shit
[0:59:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> or 2024 >_>
[0:59:45] <yourliteraldog> TWO PS5
[0:59:48] <Coystick> The ps5 is a rumor
[0:59:50] <SaltyAzteca> Look at this man being so humble
[1:00:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> Fuggins got the extra off you right?
[1:00:01] <+RenoDeGeneric> Did you score through a hookup or just get lucky?
[1:00:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> oh right
[1:00:08] <mr_saturday93> Scalpers are still making it hard to buy one?
[1:00:09] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I still don't see myself getting a PS5 yet. not until there's more games for it.
[1:00:09] <%AzureGale> Eh, there are like a zillion games out in the wild these days
[1:00:12] <+vaderxyz1970> You gave Suzie the just in case model
[1:00:13] <%teefpal> PS5's aren't canon it's just fanlore
[1:00:13] <knight_verse> Oh please Pat, you had a better chance of getting one than most of the human population.
[1:00:14] <+DatAsuna> @dawarw0lf the nomad is the only one that actually is fun to use
[1:00:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> How is Fuggins?
[1:00:19] <Daxalog> Can devs just pretend the ps5 dosnt exist. Thatd be cool.
[1:00:21] <ExpressNode> I got a series x luckily but the early announcement from Walmart fucked things up for me
[1:00:23] <tanarath> oh, suzi? nice
[1:00:23] <+senfood> Fuggins is a bro.
[1:00:23] <%Pappajimbo> he cool
[1:00:24] <%Ipsenscastle> Fuggins is the real hero of that story
[1:00:49] <%RetroCop87> don't you want to keep the just in case one as a "break glass in case of PS5 break"?
[1:00:52] <%blastyoboots> did you know that sudden and erratic US tariffs on computer components on China years back kept people in the chip industry from investing in increased capacity since they couldn't predict when more tariffs would hit?
[1:00:54] <%NopeBadguy> man, I wish I had money like that
[1:00:55] <%andrewofbob> A nice thin with PSN is that if you have a ps5, they'll let you have 15 ps4 games on top of the monthlies
[1:00:57] <luftraumm1> figgins is the real hero period
[1:01:01] <Daxalog> Isnt buying electroncs from amazon a bad idea?
[1:01:01] <mr_saturday93> Man what a great friend
[1:01:02] <+RowenCleric> when will Fuggins be back on stream
[1:01:03] <SaltyAzteca> Its trying to be Doom guy
[1:01:04] <%chance_h> This console generation might actually be skipped by most people
[1:01:10] <crazy_riggs> These mecs are so shit, they can't even wreck stuff
[1:01:12] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> LUL
[1:01:12] <GuyverTypeL> Do consoles even come lile, broken? Always had a pc
[1:01:15] <%goose_attack_almanac> why did they....
[1:01:15] <+DatAsuna> not excessive at all
[1:01:17] <dd44dostivei> roger roger
[1:01:20] <Daxalog> ok
[1:01:23] <Flame_Water> this game is fukin eye porn
[1:01:26] <dekkitout> Thar was... odd...
[1:01:27] <%Blackleafx> brrrr
[1:01:30] <%teefpal> At least you can still get the Switch
[1:01:36] <luftraumm1> pat should have figgins on stream once they're both vaccinated
[1:01:36] <5pencer1001> wierd camera angle
[1:01:38] <AluxStreams> camera angle was broken there lol
[1:01:40] <dawarw0lf> Video….gam
[1:01:42] <peachy996> I wanted that to be Tali
[1:01:44] <%Puhff> Jebaited
[1:01:45] <+Shoosler> lol
[1:01:47] <+AmericanSkidd> did the camera break in that scene?
[1:01:47] <+DatAsuna> shepard out, hackett in
[1:01:52] <%watts121> DLC still has buggy stuff.
[1:01:56] <peachy996> I'd have laughed my ass off if it was Tali shootin the robitt
[1:02:06] <%megadblitz> thank god you can still get a switch full priced 4 years after release
[1:02:09] <SaltyAzteca> OHOIOOO
[1:02:10] <%NateyBeak> mm jpg rock ground
[1:02:12] <ape_hawk> WOW
[1:02:12] <5pencer1001> the anthem of overlord
[1:02:13] <%chance_h> Mass effect has always been broken
[1:02:14] <%watts121> Too busy clipping out Miranda's ass than fixing this stuff that's been in the game for 10 years.
[1:02:14] <tanarath> Yeah, early dlc was uhhhh
[1:02:15] <SaltyAzteca> GOTTEM
[1:02:16] <karl_rex> wrow
[1:02:16] <luftraumm1> remember anthem?
[1:02:18] <%teefpal> dank anthem references bro
[1:02:18] <%Monkeyweed21> BIOWARE MAGIC
[1:02:21] <%shurtal> Anthem? From the Kingdom Hearts?
[1:02:22] <%Ipsenscastle> I feel like some of the camera angles in legendary edition are occasionally a bit fucky
[1:02:23] <+Shoosler> this is the anthem
[1:02:24] <knight_verse> PC ports are always shit, what did you expect?
[1:02:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[1:02:28] <crazy_riggs> This was the first DLC, it might look slightly better, but it was still pushed out rushed
[1:02:37] <dekkitout> Who? Anthem? Is there a gas leak?
[1:02:42] <%watts121> EA: Anthem what?!?!!?
[1:02:42] <+RenoDeGeneric> When's the indie Anthem that is just Anthem but better?
[1:02:42] <ExpressNode> They tossed that shit like it was trash day
[1:02:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> This DLC was a bit borked
[1:02:45] <+vaderxyz1970> wouldn't it be great if the post mission illusive man just go more and more drunker as the post game goes on
[1:02:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> It's still gonna make good money because people are dumb
[1:02:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is Fifa a live service game
[1:02:50] <mr_saturday93> I woukev laughed my ass off if he fell to his death there
[1:02:51] <+cermo55> Genuine question, since the Mass Effect series brings up Autism multiple times (for humans), do they ever mention any neurodivergent equivalences for the Alien species. Like, do they ever mention an Autistic Asari, or something like that.
[1:02:52] <+AmericanSkidd> "what last one"
[1:02:54] <peachy996> Technically this is the first story dlc
[1:02:54] <Coystick> "Please look forward to Ballard"
[1:02:55] <luftraumm1> bioware magic probably happens away the Cosby suite
[1:02:59] <+Wolfstriker121> its a shame what happen to anthem
[1:02:59] <%Rain_Mage> EA: What Live service game?
[1:03:01] <+Based_Moose> "What last one?"
[1:03:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "That was my Evil Twin"
[1:03:07] <%watts121> Anthem was 1 bajillion % Bioware
[1:03:07] <5pencer1001> ea and ea/bioware in particular have now droppd two games in a row that they bailed on updating
[1:03:10] <%watts121> we had nothing to do with it
[1:03:10] <dekkitout> "Anthem didn't exist."
[1:03:11] <+2sappy> Dont forget BF V
[1:03:16] <Mattais88> Pay no attention to the Anthem behind the curtain
[1:03:17] <%Rain_Mage> EA: "What's an Anthem?"
[1:03:19] <5pencer1001> its was a rogue cell at bioware
[1:03:20] <%teefpal> @cermo55 I think maybe Andromeda implies Peebee is neurodivergent
[1:03:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> EA said they will focus on single player games
[1:03:32] <+vaderxyz1970> we ment fiscal years and years
[1:03:41] <+AmericanSkidd> for years and years it makes us money
[1:03:41] <%Puhff> there will always be enough "Wow, cool robot!" gamers for them so make SOME money
[1:03:42] <+Wolfstriker121> im still waiting for a ROAD RASH game ea!!!!!! STILL WAITING
[1:03:42] <+DatAsuna> Gotta love bioware edmonton telling the MMO team to shut up anytime they pointed out how unplayable their puzzles were
[1:03:44] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> I mean andromeda got its funding cut early too lol
[1:03:45] <%watts121> Isn't Dragon Age 4 suppose to be a service game?
[1:03:46] <yourliteraldog> Thats probably a lie
[1:03:47] <ExpressNode> I'd actually consider getting the game if they actually supported it
[1:03:52] <rekinom> Yeah single player live service games
[1:03:53] <%PocketBearIllustrator> wasn't anthem/project Dylan a thing ever since EA bought Bioware?
[1:03:56] <%Rain_Mage> EA has a ten year plan or whatever
[1:03:58] <crazy_riggs> The 3 Bs's...
[1:04:00] <dekkitout> @BallerSwagBro9k But single player games aren't profitable. And no one wants to play them. SeriousSloth
[1:04:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @watts121 they walked that back
[1:04:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> Brobot and Wife
[1:04:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> good squad
[1:04:07] <%Gogogolem> Pat they'll say we're entitled.
[1:04:09] <Coystick> I wonder when the ps5 will be available on a store shelf
[1:04:09] <crazy_riggs> Bathesda, Bioware, and Blizzard
[1:04:09] <+senfood> The Three B's LUL
[1:04:12] <%ssjklyco> Magic was "We have time to work on it"
[1:04:12] <Shirousuke1989> The Three B's. BIOWARE. BETHESDA. BLIZZARD.
[1:04:13] <%teefpal> Strange, Bioware used to be the 'do-no-wrong' game company
[1:04:14] <%andrewofbob> I feel like Anthen was an attempts to capture the ME3MP magic that failed hard
[1:04:16] <peachy996> What a great situation it was for Andromeda and Anthem.
[1:04:17] <+SilverDevilfish> HA
[1:04:21] <yourliteraldog> LAB ZERO
[1:04:21] <luftraumm1> oh man
[1:04:23] <SaltyAzteca> HAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[1:04:23] <ape_hawk> THE THREE B'S
[1:04:23] <+Wolfstriker121> who said that?!?!
[1:04:24] <ExpressNode> Psst
[1:04:24] <%Ipsenscastle> Anthem was recently £2 on Playstation and I still didnt buy it because I don't think it's worth the TIME investment
[1:04:27] <%ssjklyco> Lol Lab Zero
[1:04:29] <mr_saturday93> LUL LUL LUL
[1:04:31] <%NopeBadguy> I'm genuinely amazed bioware isn't fucking dead
[1:04:31] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> i haven't followed the CSB podcast for a while, have they talked about activision/blizzard?
[1:04:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> NOTHING IS SAFE
[1:04:33] <dekkitout> Aeon Must Die. Remember that.
[1:04:33] <%cvp5127> mike z has entered chat
[1:04:35] <+SilverDevilfish> Enjoy being underpaid as fuck
[1:04:36] <+cermo55> @cermo55 Is Andromeda actually good now? I know it was awful at launch.
[1:04:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> Mike Z
[1:04:38] <%Puhff> you know it's gonna be DA4 to be live serrvice too

[1:04:58] <ape_hawk> did you see the Jeff Strain post, guiys?
[1:04:59] <peachy996> The Sun told me to not release this
[1:05:00] <ExpressNode> They are using an opportunity to dunk but missed the lay up.
[1:05:01] <%watts121> KEK
[1:05:02] <+Wolfstriker121> HOLY SHIT
[1:05:03] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> Most of the game industry is toxic as hell
[1:05:03] <%ahomeschooldropout> Battlefield 2042 looks fucking sweet tho tbh
[1:05:03] <+vaderxyz1970> Honestly your best bet for a safe enviorment is to just make your own buisness
[1:05:03] <+AmericanSkidd> boom
[1:05:04] <%peyodogo> supergiant good, cant say the same for a lot of others
[1:05:04] <FrozenMonkey> mitchiDED

[1:05:06] <%NopeBadguy> small companies are just not as able to get away with fucking you as hard as big companies
[1:05:06] <Virokwet> bad management is bad management
[1:05:06] <Daxalog> Did you not hear about how bad the Star MMazer head was?
[1:05:06] <+RenoDeGeneric> WARNING
[1:05:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> through the shield
[1:05:07] <Laecerelius> Amazing
[1:05:07] <%Wallabri> F.......

[1:05:15] <%teefpal> it's almost like it's a systemic problem!
[1:05:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I am going on year 8 of working in the game industry and feel like i need to quit and plant trees to repent
[1:05:16] <%AzureGale> DED

[1:05:21] <%Ipsenscastle> uhhh
[1:05:22] <%NopeBadguy> still fuck you
[1:05:25] <peachy996> Glass Shields
[1:05:28] <dawarw0lf> I knew it
[1:05:28] <+redthebaron> the most flimsy of all ships
[1:05:28] <stantheman_97> it's also people tend to abuse their power
[1:05:29] <Coystick> Cool wall
[1:05:39] <peachy996> Paper ship with Glass Shields
[1:05:41] <luftraumm1> I swear to God if some horrible story comes out of super giant im gonna drop games as a hobby
[1:05:42] <%PocketBearIllustrator> game development for the most part just seems like alot of unnecessary street. that's why I'm usually quite patient with developers.
[1:05:48] <$KnivesEve> the game industry always did want to be like Hollywood
[1:05:51] <yourliteraldog> Oh fuck I forgot Notch is still exists
[1:05:56] <anAngryHamster> God, convincing me to back Indivisible was the worst thing the Best Friends ever did to me
[1:05:58] <%NateyBeak> lol
[1:05:58] <%Ipsenscastle> hmm
[1:06:00] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:06:00] <5pencer1001> man this is anthem
[1:06:01] <+DatAsuna> you ran over a pebble
[1:06:01] <+kewlmyc> F
[1:06:02] <%andrewofbob> Crashing is damage?
[1:06:03] <Laecerelius> Huh
[1:06:03] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> you keep running into the shields @PatStaresAt
[1:06:04] <AluxStreams> Paper planes. lol
[1:06:05] <+redthebaron> ?
[1:06:05] <+ScreamLord> Because the shields burn
[1:06:05] <Coystick> Pro gamer
[1:06:05] <%JamesCorck> psaGoblin
[1:06:05] <%Wurmspawn> The blue shields damage you
[1:06:07] <GohansBeforeHohans> Nice
[1:06:07] <peachy996> You are the Paige of Vehicles right now
[1:06:08] <+critikal_bit> WHAT?!?!
[1:06:08] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:06:10] <+AmericanSkidd> bumping the shields
[1:06:11] <crazy_riggs> You slammed it into the shield
[1:06:11] <%Monkeyweed21> the barriers do contact damage
[1:06:12] <%NateyBeak> the ship was running New World at unlocked framerate
[1:06:13] <%ArchimerCXV> shields hurt dont rub on them
[1:06:13] <%ahomeschooldropout> amazing how Bioware manages to make a tank worse than the Mako
[1:06:13] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Shield bubbles are fucking you up
[1:06:15] <%rkbinder> you crashed too much
[1:06:15] <%teefpal> Ok what the fuck I do not remember the Hammerhead being this flimsy
[1:06:16] <peachy996> Packs a punch but defense is loooooow
[1:06:17] <+Gamblor69> Killed by climate change
[1:06:19] <+Bigbossman91> @PatStaresAt because you're touching the shield
[1:06:20] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @yourliteraldog oof, notch
[1:06:31] <+DatAsuna> also the ship is just shepard's voice
[1:06:31] <crazy_riggs> Apparently the game
[1:06:34] <%Wurmspawn> The game cares
[1:06:34] <dekkitout> Don't touch the shields. Don't even look at them.
[1:06:37] <%JamesCorck> Imagine Space Invaders but the other way around.
[1:06:41] <+DatAsuna> gotta save voice actor money
[1:06:47] <+Shady_Zaku> it's like ramming into stuff is bad or something lol
[1:06:47] <ape_hawk> THE BLUE SHIELDS HURT YOU SHEPARD
[1:06:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> Really helping the perception of orb ginger gamers Kappa
[1:06:54] <+SeventhVice> Is pat gonna try NieR reincarnation
[1:06:57] <+DatAsuna> by only having 4 voice actors
[1:06:57] <luftraumm1> they really made a tank section just cover shooting
[1:07:04] <mr_saturday93> cause fuck u
[1:07:09] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> mmmm i feel like the fact that it targets its own shield generators is a design flaw on the geth's part
[1:07:10] <+AmericanSkidd> because the hammerhead will blow up if you sneeze on it
[1:07:12] <crazy_riggs> You're asking why a vehicle doesn't like being slammed into a hard object?
[1:07:13] <%watts121> So basically if it never fired a shot it would be safe
[1:07:15] <+battle_of_the_meat> Why would it shoot it's own generators?
[1:07:19] <+ScreamLord> Anti-Hall Wugging Technology
[1:07:37] <SaltyAzteca> Legion how does this make you feel?
[1:07:41] <dd44dostivei> as shitty as it is i really do like driving the hammerhead
[1:07:51] <%teefpal> You can really feel the PS3-era gameplay here
[1:07:53] <mr_saturday93> did did kt
[1:07:58] <%strakillias> Hey guys, we should put our shield generator outside the shield. Should go well
[1:08:02] <ape_hawk> tali gonna give you a handy now
[1:08:10] <Shirousuke1989> I kept wondering why I felt weird about the word Geth and then I realized: The bad guys in Wonderful 101 are also named Geth.
[1:08:12] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> that's some outer worlds shit
[1:08:13] <peachy996> it handles better than the old mako, gotta give it that
[1:08:15] <Shirousuke1989> COINCIDENCE?
[1:08:16] <%NateyBeak> kinda looks like a halo
[1:08:18] <+vaderxyz1970> Why does a terrorist cell care about liability?
[1:08:18] <Shirousuke1989> Yes probably
[1:08:19] <Coystick> That's Legion's model
[1:08:21] <knight_verse> A Geth in an egg.
[1:08:21] <tanarath> christ, cerberus eulas
[1:08:22] <%teefpal> @dd44dostivei It's got good gamefeel but is flimsier than tissue paper
[1:08:29] <+ScreamLord> This must be Legion's equivalent to a zombie outbreak
[1:08:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @ape_hawk A purel handy
[1:08:33] <+AmericanSkidd> cerberus custom
[1:08:33] <GuyverTypeL> Holy shit, PS3 feels lile a hundred years ago
[1:08:37] <%Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[1:08:40] <%teefpal> @Shirousuke1989 WOAH A CROSSOVER?!?!?
[1:08:52] <ExpressNode> Still got my PS3 hooked up
[1:08:57] <%teefpal> What's the 2%
[1:09:00] <+CarissMcbober> Hey Pat. Just wanted to stop by and say I've been watching the whole ME series playthrough on YouTube and really enjoying it. Thanks for the great content!
[1:09:02] <peachy996> Hi Steve Blum. You truly are the working man of VAs
[1:09:14] <%Byronic_dreamer> Missed a recording
[1:09:20] <%Byronic_dreamer> I think
[1:09:22] <AluxStreams> Haunted house levels peaked at Silent Hill 3.

[1:09:35] <%Byronic_dreamer> Thought I saw a prompt
[1:09:36] <+DatAsuna> steve blum is the nolan north of troy bakers
[1:09:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> Fun Fact: Tali's ass and hips aren't actually that wide. The Quarian hips are just narrower than a humans. BUT WHO CARES QUSSY
[1:09:43] <%Blackleafx> lmao
[1:09:43] <%bread_assassin> Fuckin' Lanigan.
[1:09:44] <%teefpal> @GuyverTypeL In contrast it feels like the 8th console gen just flew right by
[1:09:44] <%ArchimerCXV> man fuck lanigan
[1:09:54] <%Blackleafx> @goose_attack_almanac the suit adds 20 pounds

[1:10:21] <yourliteraldog> fucks ass
[1:10:27] <knight_verse> Pat would be the dude that got shot for trying to prank someone in Aliens, wouldn't he?
[1:10:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> quarian waist*
[1:10:41] <SaltyAzteca> Is it saying MAKE US WHOLE

[1:10:52] <%Wallabri> SMOOTH JAZZ
[1:10:56] <%JamesCorck> It's saying Spoilers.

[1:11:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Hopefully not the promethus school of running away
[1:11:09] <peachy996> Back before Prometheus was cool and not disappointing ridley scott jank
[1:11:18] <%Monkeyweed21> SLIDING PUZZLE
[1:11:19] <28moogles> That music just makes me think of Portal

[1:12:08] <%amaranthos> I usually like puzzles but this one is a bridge too far
[1:12:11] <peachy996> You did it! Baba is you!
[1:12:11] <dekkitout> @SaltkeyAndAckfish I say yes.
[1:12:12] <+Shady_Zaku> orb fading

[1:12:23] <secret_npc> TRIVIA: The composer for this DLC also composed the film Ride Along 2, starring Ice Cube and Kevin Hart ☝️
[1:12:24] <%Wurmspawn> Prettys ure this is the area with the "non existent" upgrade.
[1:12:26] <dawarw0lf> You…did…it
[1:12:28] <+Shady_Zaku> @amaranthos lmao
[1:12:29] <%teefpal> "pacing"

[1:12:47] <%Ipsenscastle> big brain am winning again
[1:12:47] <SovPho> bro your brain is so fuckin wrinkly it's hot
[1:12:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> baba is shepard?
[1:12:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fuck touching anything i need to twist and pull out like that
[1:12:54] <+AmericanSkidd> wake me up inside
[1:13:03] <peachy996> Legion put your lens flare away
[1:13:06] <+DatAsuna> tali has such a boner right now
[1:13:08] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> @dekkitout mmm i liked how it answered a lot of questions, but i feel like it could have been a trilogy instead of 2 filsm
[1:13:08] <knight_verse> "GET THE FUCK OUT"
[1:13:09] <5pencer1001> does shepard only speak quips in these dlcs?
[1:13:11] <%Ipsenscastle> @mr_saturday93 it's pronounced penius
[1:13:12] <SaltyAzteca> I am standing right here
[1:13:13] <Meta_Outhorii> of course Tali shoots first
[1:13:18] <%psidefx> wE DONT HAVE A CHOICE HERE
[1:13:20] <secret_npc> Chat, has he done Arrival yet?
[1:13:22] <%Monkeyweed21> missed a log @PatStaresAt
[1:13:29] <Nautilaa> anyone else thinks the maleshep voice acting is bland and emotionless compared to femshep?
[1:13:32] <SaltyAzteca> AT LEAST CERBERUS IS HONEST
[1:13:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> good thing Tali's suit is hydrophobic
[1:13:46] <%Ipsenscastle> @Nautilaa most people I think, yeah
[1:13:47] <%Blackleafx> hes ding arrival after this
[1:13:47] <knight_verse> @meta_outhorii And "accidentally" hits Legion.
[1:13:52] <%teefpal> Damn, vanguard gameplay looks great
[1:14:02] <dawarw0lf> @nautilaa It’s just you and some uncultured others
[1:14:04] <yourliteraldog> No Joke Shepeard looks like a bitter Football Coach
[1:14:14] <secret_npc> Thanks
[1:14:17] <peachy996> End of this DLC has the best Paragon Prompt
[1:14:30] <%Monkeyweed21> and you only have half your kit too
[1:14:32] <%teefpal> I went infiltrator and headshots were fun, but it made things very repetitive.
[1:14:33] <shotgang86> holy shit that distance
[1:14:34] <mr_saturday93> *Manguard
[1:14:40] <5pencer1001> vanguard rules on low difficulty, but gets shredded on ultra hard
[1:14:41] <dawarw0lf> Knowing Pat he will totally miss the prompt
[1:14:42] <secret_npc> Chat, is he going back to Shadow Broker base for the extra shit?
[1:14:44] <knight_verse> Remember guys, he's playing on Normal difficulty.
[1:14:45] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat was intent on being a Soldier pleb until everyone convinced him to play Vanguard
[1:14:45] <yourliteraldog> legion cries
[1:14:46] <Nautilaa> LUL @dawarw0lf
[1:14:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Zengethi Kappa
[1:14:54] <+probably_facetious> Don't shoot Legion! He's one of the good ones!
[1:14:54] <+unhuggable1> lmao why would it smell
[1:14:58] <TourettesPlays> Each individual geth probably smells like a new car
[1:14:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> nice of the geth ship to fall apart into waist high cover
[1:14:59] <GuyverTypeL> @nautilaa I think both are fine, but femshep seems to have more emotion in some lines.
[1:14:59] <SaltyAzteca> What are they feeding you smelly geth
[1:15:01] <Ides42> what do Geth smell like?
[1:15:04] <%watts121> Tali: That's right brudda!
[1:15:06] <%machshop> tali can only smell her suit
[1:15:11] <%teefpal> It's because Legion is so passive
[1:15:12] <ThatGuyThere03> because he's a toaster and doesn't understand bullying
[1:15:13] <%dooscent> get think soap is an organic weakness
[1:15:15] <+DatAsuna> @secret_npc he just went in and out like 3 times to cycle it last time
[1:15:17] <%dooscent> geth, even
[1:15:21] <peachy996> @secret_npc if you mean dialogue and videos he went through it already
[1:15:25] <yourliteraldog> Don't you dare bully roboJesus
[1:15:25] <+kullumanati> Geth can swim unlike Rats
[1:15:25] <crazy_riggs> Pat, isn't a Geth your ideal human form?
[1:15:27] <%ArchimerCXV> 'Shepard Commander - Geth lack olfactory sense and operate on a near-zero emission scheme, we do not smell'
[1:15:32] <yourliteraldog> He died for our sins
[1:15:33] <%watts121> god I wonder what Tali smells like after doing all this stuff in that suit
[1:15:38] <Dunmarkh> Tali can't smell anything because your cum gave her covid
[1:15:39] <dekkitout> I get Tali rubbed off on you, but I thought she did that in a more literal sense...
[1:15:46] <%amaranthos> amaranthos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Recently secured my income again, so have some streamer bucks. Also, many months late congratulations to you and Paige.
[1:15:46] <ExpressNode> ThiS game has a map right?
[1:15:51] <%saiyanblitz> Legion is like Shepard Commander why did you bring me on this mission just to bully me
[1:15:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Tzengethi Kappa
[1:15:57] <dawarw0lf> @datasuna She does the “get mad a joker” scene in 3 really bland.
[1:16:00] <%Garthunox> @ExpressNode HA!
[1:16:02] <%Garthunox> no
[1:16:03] <GuyverTypeL> I would be transformed into a geth just to not have back pain
[1:16:10] <yourliteraldog> Geth are software programs
[1:16:10] <Nautilaa> its kinda ironic cause every character has amazing voice acting except the protagonist, at least imo @guyvertypel
[1:16:11] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> @dekkitout well she rubbed him off, that's for sure Kappa
[1:16:14] <shotgang86> Legion: Why u bullying me?
[1:16:20] <mr_saturday93> Pat speak in 3rd person again?
[1:16:21] <%machshop> oh YOU'RE Pat?
[1:16:24] <SaltyAzteca> I thought you were Paige Kappa
[1:16:25] <%Monkeyweed21> the geth followed Saren they aren't exactly the smartest
[1:16:32] <+ScreamLord> Dead Space? more like Geth Space
[1:16:38] <%teefpal> The Emergency Option is gun
[1:16:43] <peachy996> Can't wait till Pat learns to cycle Nova, Charge and Heavy Melee
[1:16:45] <5pencer1001> thats one big geth baby
[1:16:59] <TourettesPlays> Using AI Hacking on a Geth Prime is Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:17:06] <yourliteraldog> It's hard to kill geth in meaningful way
[1:17:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Big boy! Taking 2 rounds of buckshot before nappy time!"
[1:17:09] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> who is this pat people keep referring to
[1:17:19] <dawarw0lf> Any arguing mark meer can’t act look up “Shepard gets mad at joker” in 3 from both and see the difference. Mark excels in that scene
[1:17:22] <mr_saturday93> You fellas think their going to screw up the new dead space
[1:17:28] <ExpressNode> The Geth Knight
[1:17:36] <%megadblitz> Geth Prime more like Minimus Geth
[1:17:39] <%machshop> obviously
[1:17:45] <stantheman_97> absolutely
[1:17:45] <%ssjklyco> Now with more Micro and guns
[1:17:47] <peachy996> @dawarw0lf I legit think Meer kills it at the end of this DLC
[1:17:51] <yourliteraldog> It's going to be gatcha
[1:17:52] <+AmericanSkidd> remember when you beat the shadow broker to death with just your fists?
[1:17:52] <dawarw0lf> But what if they don’t?
[1:17:53] <$KnivesEve> of course
[1:17:54] <+senfood> Which studio is developing it?
[1:17:58] <peachy996> Way better than Hale did
[1:17:59] <%JamesCorck> EA's going to fuck up Dragon Age 4, so hard.
[1:18:00] <tanarath> 110 certain
[1:18:00] <GuyverTypeL> Pat is a streamer, he likes videogames, has a wife a two babies, zangief the dog and elmo the cat.
[1:18:00] <Madinki> @mr_saturday93 iT'S EA
[1:18:01] <%teefpal> I can't imagine how they couldn't.
[1:18:03] <%Ipsenscastle> I mean without the original team I don't wanna buy it anyway, it seems like bad taste so soon
[1:18:05] <+battle_of_the_meat> more like dead dead space
[1:18:06] <SaltyAzteca> You mean Callisto Protocol or something?
[1:18:06] <+Shady_Zaku> unfortunately I don't have much hope for it
[1:18:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> @senfood Motive I think
[1:18:14] <+DatAsuna> dead space 3 should have been only the starship graveyard stuff
[1:18:18] <yourliteraldog> Speaking of Gatcha Nier Reincarnation is out.
[1:18:19] <%JamesCorck> Dragon Age 4 is going to be awful, goddamn.
[1:18:20] <%Ziegsy> I was walking my dog and a lady wanted to pet her. I said okay, then the deranged woman FED MY DOG CANDY FROM HER OWN MOUTH
[1:18:25] <mr_saturday93> @madinki true but they did give us Fallen order
[1:18:25] <Mutsu2k> @Nautilaa The fact that Shepard is allowed to speak in all cutscenes is a feat on itself, (Looks at most CAC games with blank MC
[1:18:29] <anAngryHamster> Dead Space 1 and 2 were only good because EA gave the devs a modicum of control
[1:18:30] <%Archmortal> We didn't exactly hear of anything around the Bioware offices changing after it got out that it's as emotionally traumatic to work there as anything we've read about recently
[1:18:32] <peachy996> It's telling how they announced it with a CGI teaser
[1:18:32] <Gelphaze> Hell YEA!
[1:18:34] <%Byronic_dreamer> It would be sick if they didn't
[1:18:35] <dawarw0lf> This is the dlc next after bring down the sky
[1:18:35] <5pencer1001> pat did you ever play pinnacle station for me1?
[1:18:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Does Pat know about the super specific Legion dialogue where he reveals that everyone melted down to create a reaper maintains conciousness and the whole "Sovereign nation unto themself" thing was literal
[1:18:39] <%JamesCorck> Oh boy here we go.
[1:18:39] <+AmericanSkidd> go to 4 places?
[1:18:40] <%watts121> In Darksiders 2 that was the entire fucking game.
[1:18:40] <jorniev> EVEN if they dont fuck it up its just gonna be as good as there original, and yes i know they are changing things
[1:18:44] <%teefpal> tbh this final mission was super cool to me back in the day
[1:18:47] <dekkitout> Would you prefer go to the 5 places?
[1:18:51] <+Ches_Neckbeard> it needs to be 5 places
[1:18:52] <yourliteraldog> Zelda
[1:19:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> @ziegsy I would have thrown that bitch into the trash
[1:19:01] <%Blackleafx> wow
[1:19:05] <Nautilaa> not disagreeing with that @mutsu2k
[1:19:08] <dekkitout> Citation plz
[1:19:09] <dawarw0lf> You need to talk to legion after this mission pat
[1:19:10] <peachy996> you missed a convo prob
[1:19:16] <%Ziegsy> @GalacticaPhanto I nearly did
[1:19:18] <+AmericanSkidd> what a nightmare
[1:19:21] <+ScreamLord> Callisto Protocol and Negative Atmosphere look more promising until we get actual Dead Space Remake gameplay
[1:19:23] <dawarw0lf> He still has stuff to say
[1:19:25] <s1rcuit> @Ziegsy might need to consider moving, or at least walking your dog somewhere else
[1:19:26] <%teefpal> @Monkeyweed21 Oh yeah, same thing as the Geth Dyson Sphere, but nonconsensual
[1:19:28] <%rkbinder> Studies show that not doing things by ones or threes causes people anxiety
[1:19:39] <SovPho> good
[1:19:40] <+cermo55> its like how butterflies have memories from catapillars despite liquifying
[1:19:41] <%Garthunox> But if we dont go to the 3 places how will we get the baphmodads needed to unlock the samophlange?
[1:19:44] <SovPho> let them be anxious
[1:19:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you need to get the dialogue about the Geth Dyson Sphere project and choose a specific option comparing it to the reapers, only if its before the Suicide Mission
[1:19:51] <SaltyAzteca> Before it can...ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL?
[1:19:58] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:19:59] <%bearwagon> oh boy
[1:20:00] <%watts121> HIS AUTISM IS A GIFT!
[1:20:01] <ThatGuyThere03> bruh
[1:20:02] <yourliteraldog> Geth are my fave-riot thing about mass effect.
[1:20:02] <peachy996> aw ye
[1:20:02] <TourettesPlays> fuckin YIKES
[1:20:04] <jorniev> the one thing i wanted about dead space was the conclusion to the dead space 2 DLC story
[1:20:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> boooooo
[1:20:04] <%blastyoboots> YAY AUTISM
[1:20:07] <%amaranthos> @rkbinder hope that study was done at least one or three times
[1:20:07] <%machshop> riiiiiiight
[1:20:07] <%Ipsenscastle> his magic autistic mind
[1:20:07] <Mattais88> That Implies that there's thousands of species that consist entirely of assholes, if the reaper fleet is that big
[1:20:08] <%bread_assassin> Hmmmmm
[1:20:08] <+cermo55> EEEEEEEEEVVVVVVIIIIIIILLLLLLL
[1:20:09] <%ssjklyco> OH NO It's THE PREDATOR
[1:20:09] <ThatGuyThere03> THIS IS JUST THAT BAD PREDATOR MOVIE
[1:20:09] <mr_saturday93> Autism is power!
[1:20:10] <Coystick> Autism is a super power
[1:20:10] <+senfood> HERE WE GO
[1:20:11] <5pencer1001> I want to see a sci-fi/fantasy story where people get melted/amalgamated but then afterword are like "man this rules"
[1:20:11] <karl_rex> Eugh
[1:20:14] <+Kyma1020> The worst
[1:20:15] <%StaceMcGate> Autism will cure climate change
[1:20:15] <%NitronStreams> OOOOOOF
[1:20:15] <SaltyAzteca> Oh now I remember this mission
[1:20:15] <+probably_facetious> AUTISM SUPERPOWER
[1:20:16] <%PocketBearIllustrator> oh, no.
[1:20:16] <+rafaelba93> oh...
[1:20:20] <Dunmarkh> HE'S LIKE A COMPUTER
[1:20:21] <%PocketBearIllustrator> this is it.
[1:20:21] <%ElkRiverDog> NGL: I thought you were joking
[1:20:22] <SaltyAzteca> THANKS RIDLEY SCOTT.
[1:20:22] <stantheman_97> AUTISM LETS YOU SPEAK COMPUTER
[1:20:23] <+senfood> Please, be patient with him.
[1:20:23] <rekinom> Does this mean the geth are autistic
[1:20:24] <blackjack8182> Kaine?
[1:20:24] <%Reaviar> magic brain powers go!
[1:20:25] <dawarw0lf> @monkeyweed21 I thought it can be whenever?
[1:20:26] <+Shady_Zaku> FUCKING DUMB PREDATOR SHIT
[1:20:28] <%chance_h> It's a gift because he has more chromosomes which = more power
[1:20:30] <%NitronStreams> That is fucking embarrassing
[1:20:32] <jorniev> IS this THE DLC with theautism gives you super powers story?
[1:20:34] <tanarath> THE NAZIS HAD SOME GREAT SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTATION PRACTICES
[1:20:38] <+Ches_Neckbeard> can't wait for the child to speak in fucking Geth like ya know nobody else can
[1:20:43] <dekkitout> Why bother to do autism is a super power? Why not juat blah blah biotics?
[1:20:44] <Aiutare47> His AUTISTIC MIND
[1:20:45] <Mattais88> the coolest part of the dlc
[1:20:45] <dawarw0lf> This isn’t bad as predator
[1:20:45] <%blastyoboots> don't make me AUTISM at you
[1:20:46] <+cermo55> THE AI isn't evil its having a PANIC ATTACK
[1:20:49] <%PocketBearIllustrator> they actually called autism a power. you were not kidding, Pat.
[1:20:54] <+flillycake> TIL autism allows communication with machinery
[1:20:55] <Vantesla> People remember the terrible writing and person is the psycho scientist brother using his autistic brother as a guinea pig...
[1:20:56] <+Kyma1020> As someone who recently found out they're autistic, this mission was the worst
[1:21:00] <+AmericanSkidd> he might have fun he says
[1:21:00] <peachy996> ENJOY IT ?!
[1:21:01] <GuyverTypeL> Do people really come to pet owners to ask to pet their pets? I find that weird allowing randoms to pet my pet.
[1:21:02] <+Kyma1020> Made me so mad
[1:21:03] <peachy996> Yeah man
[1:21:05] <%Ipsenscastle> if this DLC was just the fun doors, I'd like it
[1:21:06] <%teefpal> oh no
[1:21:08] <peachy996> He's loving it
[1:21:11] <%megadblitz> how many dead space remake reviews are going to say "just go play the original"
[1:21:18] <%amaranthos> The Illusive Man did nothing wrong.
[1:21:21] <%watts121> Watch the elevator numbers
[1:21:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @dawarw0lf if you have the talk before the Suicide Mission Legion makes a cryptic statement about Humanity's future and then follows it up post mission
[1:21:25] <%AncelDeLambert> AncelDeLambert subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! Good job getting through both Mass Effects, Pat, the only Mass Effects they made. What a shame EA destroyed the company before they could produce anymore games of any kind, what a waste
[1:21:26] <yourliteraldog> Mengela in the house
[1:21:26] <%chance_h> @GuyverTypeL Can i pet you animal?
[1:21:28] <%machshop> raaaah
[1:21:30] <karl_rex> I'm going to connect my brothers brain to an alien AI. Sounds like fun
[1:21:32] <%teefpal> Puzzle time
[1:21:35] <+senfood> Illusive Male Grindset
[1:21:41] <dawarw0lf> The dlc clearly paint archer as a BAD GUY for doing this stuff. How is it questionable?
[1:21:43] <+cermo55> just a rouge cell
[1:21:44] <%Wurmspawn> IT'sd apuzzle
[1:21:48] <+probably_facetious> @megadblitz All of them, except the ones who get paid to say it's great.
[1:21:48] <$Futurecity10> shoot the camera
[1:21:51] <%machshop> it's a puzzle pat
[1:21:53] <dawarw0lf> I’m really don’t get it
[1:21:56] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'm surprised this is still in the Legendary Edition.
[1:21:56] <+AmericanSkidd> he can connect to an ocean of voices, as a treat
[1:21:57] <GuyverTypeL> @chance_h yeah I guess? lol
[1:21:57] <%Wurmspawn> There are other consoles

[1:24:15] <+critikal_bit> Fuck THAT Geth in particular - Legion
[1:24:18] <dekkitout> So the guy was basically an X-men
[1:24:19] <peachy996> And the writers for The Predator were like "hmmmmm"

[1:24:29] <+probably_facetious> "HIS AUTISTIC MIND IS AS ALIEN TO ME AS AN ACTUAL ALIEN"
[1:24:29] <Dunmarkh> @JohnAtDawn His autistic mind is as alien to me as a real alien
[1:24:36] <%shurtal> it's like a time capsule, filled with shit
[1:24:37] <%teefpal> It actually got good reviews at the time

[1:24:55] <%Ipsenscastle> best door
[1:24:56] <stantheman_97> yeah no even back then autistic people weren't seen as fucking aliens
[1:25:00] <SaltyAzteca> @PocketBearIllustrator Thanks Ridley Scott

[1:25:16] <Vantesla> David is super rainman who can also communicate in binary/audio sounds...
[1:25:17] <%AncelDeLambert> are they going for a kind of horror movie type thing? Cuz I'm not scared.

[1:25:38] <TourettesPlays> even in situations that have nothing to do with the reapers shepard cant shut up about them
[1:25:40] <%JohnAtDawn> CYBORG
[1:25:41] <karl_rex> Oh yeah Shepard is part synthetic
[1:25:42] <%greencapps> Wait if autism makes it easier to interface with AI are they implicating that autistic people are closer to being robots than they are humans
[1:25:42] <%Monkeyweed21> OH RIGHT YOU'RE A CYBORG
[1:25:42] <%chance_h> The area doesn't let you save because the scripted events bug when you reload from certain points

[1:27:59] <%BlackStarAura> SAVANT BULLSHIT
[1:28:00] <%Romuken> Man I'm autistic and I can't do this shit. Wish I had the useful smart autism.
[1:28:04] <%Ziegsy> did the writer of this dlc just watch the cube and take it from that?
[1:28:08] <ape_hawk> using him as a literal recorder
[1:28:10] <%teefpal> using his brother as a literal object
[1:28:11] <crazy_riggs> To be fair, a single geth program is ungodly stupid thing, only when hundreds are together can they become smarter than normal. I imagine the language is simple, if even a single program can communicate it
[1:28:12] <%chance_h> Autism causes people to speak dialtone
[1:28:13] <Kalakukkoo> so this did 'autism is a superpower' before that predator movie
[1:28:16] <%PocketBearIllustrator> yeah, this is just bad. I'm sorry.

[1:29:14] <ExpressNode> So I turned off that smart notification thing. I wonder why for months on end that I never go them.
[1:29:16] <+Kyma1020> EVEN WITH AN EIDETIC MEMORY, HUMANS CAN'T PROCESS INFORMATION AT LIGHTSPEED
[1:29:16] <%JamesCorck> I mean, Pat you shouldn't have jokes, honestly.
[1:29:16] <alroy900> ohgod, this dialogue is pure pain
[1:29:17] <+Ghufufin> if he is a human computer wouldnt a regular computer be able to do the same?
[1:29:19] <%teefpal> The worst is yet to come
[1:29:21] <%OrangeMDT> Bet Paige can do this too
[1:29:21] <%Ynkubus_> mentat*
[1:29:22] <%JamesCorck> This is upsetting as fuck DX
[1:29:22] <+BaddyBanterITV> the joke is Bioware
[1:29:23] <%sjay662> Actually weaponizing autism
[1:29:23] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt What if we used 100% of our brains?
[1:29:23] <%Monkeyweed21> DOES THIS MEAN LEGION HAS AUTISM OR SOME SHIT
[1:29:24] <heartlesshealer> Save us with your squeaky toy, Zangief
[1:29:24] <+AmericanSkidd> it all seemed harmless
[1:29:25] <+Shady_Zaku> AUTISMO COMPUTER POWERS
[1:29:27] <shotgang86> autism is a superpower AGAIN
[1:29:28] <%hrbeck_> Jokes left
[1:29:28] <5pencer1001> Never read Mass Effect Deception
[1:29:32] <%xcompleasedad> IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN I REMEMBER
[1:29:32] <yourliteraldog> They are really hitting that autism angle
[1:29:34] <Aiutare47> Oh man oh man
[1:29:35] <tanarath> widow
[1:29:37] <Flame_Water> his brother crying for help
[1:29:37] <AluxStreams> Like it goes beyond "Archer is an asshole" and into "wow the people who wrote this didn't do their research."
[1:29:37] <Vantesla> All hate should be on David brother. Be the dumb trope David isn't really bad. Just the stuff around his character is pretty idiotic. the horror theme is kinda cool if reduced under the bad writing.
[1:29:38] <%watts121> From the Award Winning Studio...BIOWARE
[1:29:39] <dekkitout> I got a joke. The sheer ineptitude that is the writing
[1:29:40] <jorniev> I MEAN i liked DRELL's story in Warframe
[1:29:44] <+battle_of_the_meat> @Kyma1020 But autism tho
[1:29:46] <+cermo55> HE'S NOT EVEN A CYBORG
[1:29:48] <williamrooster> was understanding how the geth talk even a problem before this dlc
[1:29:48] <+xTheAngryDwarfx> Isnt this the plot to that one predator movie lol
[1:29:49] <dawarw0lf> I think everyone here is getting the wrong impression on what’s happening.
[1:29:55] <+AmericanSkidd> make it stop
[1:29:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fuck off, techno ghosts!
[1:29:58] <peachy996> Look I don't even care about the writers decision to do it like that, to me it just solidified Dr. Archer as a bastard
[1:29:58] <Apegacine> maybe bioware should have never tried with how hard they are failimng
[1:30:00] <TourettesPlays> Isnt Mentally Ill people having super powers a Stephen King cliche?
[1:30:05] <%ahomeschooldropout> don't the geth like
[1:30:06] <%PocketBearIllustrator> see, this is what happens when you should have autistic people write autistic characters.
[1:30:06] <$KnivesEve> why do video game writers think they know stuff. Just research MAN
[1:30:12] <%CatastropheCorvid> Did different writers write this? Did they forget their own explanation for how the Geth transmit data? Will I ask a third question?
[1:30:12] <%hrbeck_> Drell was good, he had magic powers AND was autistic
[1:30:14] <+ScreamLord> Who did it worse: Project Overlord or The Predator 2018?
[1:30:14] <feefer_drunk3rland> quailty standard bioware writing
[1:30:16] <%ahomeschooldropout> talk to each other instantanously via some internet bullshit
[1:30:17] <+Kyma1020> Even with Autism that's not how it works
[1:30:26] <+RenoDeGeneric> He gave Pat Sheppard the autism
[1:30:28] <%teefpal> Obviously Archer is being depicted as the bad guy, the problem is the Autism Superpower trope
[1:30:30] <%sjay662> @ScreamLord Predator
[1:30:36] <5pencer1001> bonk the bots
[1:30:39] <%jessiwitt> SeemsGood1000 mst3kItStinks !itstinks
[1:30:40] <heartlesshealer> Yes, it's also a poor Steven King cliché
[1:30:42] <%watts121> is WWE real?
[1:30:43] <%blastyoboots> Don't worry, if you're infected with Autism you can just get a vaccine for it- OH SHIT
[1:30:47] <+probably_facetious> They look like Geth to you?
[1:30:48] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 That’s the item there. Not “autism is cool” this project is an absolute failure and super not worth it
[1:30:57] <Vantesla> @tourettesplays kinda. to be fair in many of his classic books he openly admitted to doing tons of cocaine LUL
[1:30:58] <%teefpal> FULL LAWNMOWER MAN
[1:31:04] <+AmericanSkidd> it sucks really bad
[1:31:10] <Madinki> I have Autisum.....WHY CAN'T I BE AN IDIOT SAVANT!
[1:31:11] <dekkitout> @TourettesPlays I mean, that depends on how you want to analyze storytelling throughout history/cultures
[1:31:16] <%someyounguy1> oh boy this is just peak bad mass effect 2
[1:31:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Now shoot the mentally ill man
[1:31:23] <%Blackleafx> the guy did an outlast
[1:31:24] <5pencer1001> why do they keep geth guns with the deactivated geth
[1:31:24] <+SikNoscz> oh man I joined just in time for the most collar-tugging DLC
[1:31:27] <Dunmarkh> YOU NEED TO KILL AUTISM PAT

[1:31:50] <+Shady_Zaku> KILL THE AUTISM WITH YOUR BIOTIC AUTISM PAT
[1:31:56] <%hrbeck_> Quick! Shoot the crystals into the autism ball!

[1:32:00] <Dunmarkh> YOU NEED TO UNVACCINATE HIM
[1:32:02] <%BlackStarAura> YOU ARE THE VACCINE PAT
[1:32:09] <Dunmarkh> SUCK OUT THE VACCINE PAT
[1:32:13] <%teefpal> I would say Arrival is Worse but watching this again after like 10 years, this has aged soo poorly
[1:32:15] <crimeagentalpha> His autism is TOO STRONG
[1:32:17] <%someyounguy1> DAVID WANTS NUGGIES
[1:32:24] <%coward_man> oh it gets worse
[1:32:27] <peachy996> Just give him a series of behavioral shocks
[1:32:27] <SaltyAzteca> BE THE GLITCH YOU WERE MEANT TO BE @PatStaresAt
[1:32:30] <dawarw0lf> Yeah I’m just going to chat here
[1:32:30] <peachy996> that'll work
[1:32:32] <Madinki> WE NEED TO KILL AUTISUM TO STOP THE REAPERS YOU GUYS.
[1:32:44] <dawarw0lf> Your all misssing the point massively
[1:32:45] <%maenos2> just wait pat
[1:32:47] <GustauveVIII> there's a unique game over screen if you fail the upload sequence
[1:32:49] <%maenos2> wait and see hwo david realy is in there
[1:32:54] <%jessiwitt> !ACABthotshit mst3kHurt
[1:32:56] <+cermo55> HOW DID YOU INSTALL MOUTH TUBES AND NOT THINK YOU'RE EVIL!?!?!?
[1:32:59] <Coystick> He cute
[1:32:59] <AmuserName> :(
[1:33:00] <%coward_man> never forget, autism makes you magic but ALSO autism makes you completely unable to act like a human
[1:33:01] <Vantesla> @peachy996 outside of unable to stop X or scripted stealth I don't recall Arrival in any negative terms. If because of the low point I believe that was the intention.
[1:33:02] <Apegacine> little pupper healing the pain
[1:33:02] <%megadblitz> what would anti vaxxers think of this?

[1:34:44] <%strakillias> Member when Cerberus claimed that the base that held Jack as a kid was a break off group and they wouldn't do that? As opposed to this 100% Cerberus Certified experiment.

[1:36:44] <%ElkRiverDog> Ask Chawkwas?
[1:36:46] <+ScatterCatt> Unhooking him would probably kill him at that point, let's be honest.
[1:36:47] <%NopeBadguy> mordin could do it
[1:36:48] <+cermo55> whelp, time for war crimes
[1:36:48] <%Ipsenscastle> honestly the crazy cyber torture design makes that whole scene too ridiculous
[1:36:48] <%Vyskus> I feel like there's a clear point where you realize that you're literally crucifying him that you go hey wait

[1:37:43] <heartlesshealer> god, fuck that whole mission
[1:37:48] <%Zalapski> doesn't Gavin kill himself in 3 if you make peace with the get because he realizes all he did to his brother was for nothing
[1:37:51] <yourliteraldog> Based Robojesus
[1:37:57] <darkl0rdmorgoth> Hullo
[1:37:57] <%ElkRiverDog> So this is my friend, Legion. He's a healer main and quite the talker
[1:38:02] <%teefpal> @Zalapski "good"
[1:38:09] <+Alig200> Legion talking to Shepard about this stuff doesn't mean he would eagerly go and tell Cerberus/TIM lol.
[1:38:20] <dawarw0lf> @zalapski If you tell him (or lie about it) that David dies he kills himself
[1:38:24] <darkl0rdmorgoth> BIG FUCKING ROBOT HOLE
[1:38:28] <+senfood> That's a damn good point, Legion.
[1:38:30] <5pencer1001> gavin kills himself if you dont tell him his brother is ok after you save him
[1:38:30] <SaltyAzteca> THATS TRUE
[1:38:32] <falyden> Sigmund and frod
[1:38:34] <+Bigbossman91> @Zalapski no he kills himself if you lie about saving David from Grissom Academy
[1:38:37] <+OneGorillionDollars> OUR GODS DISOWNED US

[1:41:14] <TourettesPlays> 320,000 = "some"
[1:41:21] <falyden> time to dunk on some batarians
[1:41:43] <%teefpal> to be fair, Batarians are basically Space North Korea + slavers
[1:41:45] <peachy996> God the aftermath of Arrival is so stupid.
[1:41:57] <dawarw0lf> I feel like chat is just trying to be difficult with overlord
[1:42:16] <5pencer1001> I am in the middle of carrying a ME2 game about to close it out, and my fiance brings me a banana (not asked for) with chips. So how is your day going?
[1:42:19] <peachy996> Thinking about the damage you do to the galaxy even if it is just Batarians is insane
[1:42:23] <%Ascethetic> Ascethetic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! this notification won't go away until I say something. Hope you and yours are doing swell, jiggle the fatty pig dog burgers for me. Also, you stinky
[1:42:25] <+AmericanSkidd> i wonder how many (if any) reapers get caught in the blast?
[1:42:28] <%Ziegsy> the clapping here just gave me BBS ice cream flash backs
[1:42:36] <peachy996> And your punishment? Sit in timeout on Earth
[1:42:51] <dekkitout> @dawarw0lf What, was it not obvious about the collective abrasiveness towards the unwieldy trope?
[1:43:02] <+Bigbossman91> @AmericanSkidd probably 0
[1:43:02] <%teefpal> @5pencer1001 gonna graduate with an associates this week so good
[1:43:04] <peachy996> You're not even in a cell, you're on earth being judged by the alliance
[1:43:07] <Madinki> @dawarw0lf Nonono, we're being absoutely fair i feel
[1:43:07] <Vantesla> I find the amount of Batarian death funny given the size/numerical difference in that system vs in ME1 where one human Colony encompassed that several times. Aka the one Balak tried to destroy.
[1:43:26] <%kysath> kysath subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Heyo 14 month hype, thanks for good content! Was wondering, since you're the biggest FFT mark I'm aware of, what's the best way to play the original: the PS1 or the PSP remaster?
[1:43:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @peachy996 I believe its house arrest, during which Vega is your guard
[1:43:50] <peachy996> House Arrest is absurd
[1:44:06] <peachy996> For an event like that
[1:44:18] <5pencer1001> the beginning of me3 makes absolutely no sense if you didnt play arrival
[1:44:22] <%teefpal> Its a plot device to get Shepard on Earth
[1:44:27] <+Ches_Neckbeard> eh they're batarians who cares
[1:44:27] <Madinki> House Arrest is plot Jail
[1:44:30] <+AmericanSkidd> Probably more accurate to say protective custody
[1:44:42] <peachy996> But he shouldn't even BE on earth to be judged is my problem
[1:44:47] <%andrewofbob> @5pencer1001 Alliance is like "ew, you got in bed with Cerberus"
[1:44:48] <%shurtal> good ol' dilk
[1:44:52] <knight_verse> Time for War Crimes.
[1:44:53] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt remember that killing Batarians is wrong
[1:44:54] <peachy996> This is not an Alliance matter, it's a Citadel matter
[1:45:01] <Shirousuke1989> So pat... will you play Andromeda after 3?
[1:45:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Arrival sure is a 7/10
[1:45:09] <dawarw0lf> @madinki If it was trying to do what predator did then I’d agree but it’s not. The focus is on how much of an asshole Gavin is. Predator is about how magical and special the kid is with autism.
[1:45:13] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:45:18] <+Ches_Neckbeard> does the citadel really care about a couple dead batarians though?
[1:45:26] <GustauveVIII> You can do the first part of Arrival in stealth. It doesn't actually matter whether you stealth or not.
[1:45:31] <stantheman_97> is andromeda legendary?
[1:45:31] <Alzero83> Andromeda? Why would pat torture himself with that game...
[1:45:33] <%ssjklyco> Andromada was too boring the last time they did it.
[1:45:36] <Vantesla> @peachy996 Without the evidence he was going to be executed. It was due to his record and cooperation he wasn't getting worse. Also logically he did the right thing given all would died if he didn't do anything anyways.
[1:45:36] <%Ranryu692> Andromeda is legendarily fucky
[1:45:37] <dekkitout> Andromeda? Who's that? Sounds like a goober.
[1:45:38] <Inparadisum> hey pat i just switched from wow to FF14, do i need to have multiple classes at max lvl for the next expansion or is 1 fine?
[1:45:41] <alwayspronking> so were we LUL
[1:45:44] <5pencer1001> Arrival feels like "oh shit we forgot to move the plot forward in ME2!"
[1:45:45] <Dunmarkh> @Alzero83 for content
[1:45:46] <%coward_man> Andromeda is just a copy paste of the plot of ME1 just done worse
[1:45:47] <%DashXero> Just like everyone else.
[1:45:48] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm already kinda done with it, and I'm not even playing
[1:45:51] <%walternatorz> Pat, maybe you can become an famous FFXIV streamer
[1:45:52] <dawarw0lf> Andromeda is a 6/10 it’s fine and mediocre
[1:45:53] <+Rewrench> 3rd game ending makes you done with the whole thing
[1:45:53] <Madinki> Andromida is.........FUCKING.....BORING.....
[1:45:56] <$realm_forge> Andromeda feels like it has no soul
[1:45:56] <SaltyAzteca> As you would be. Especially with the 3rd game.
[1:46:04] <TourettesPlays> Arrival had probably the best combat in all of ME2
[1:46:06] <peachy996> I can't for 3 so I can want to be done with it
[1:46:09] <williamrooster> "rescue"
[1:46:21] <Alzero83> You still playing stories 2 @PatStaresAt ?
[1:46:28] <%BlackStarAura> Andromeda’s crew were a bunch of unlikeable assholes, tbh
[1:46:31] <dawarw0lf> I can’t wait for 3 because much more of it is good then people give credit on
[1:46:38] <%Wallabri> Melee and Casters
[1:46:41] <%BlackStarAura> I only like the Krogan
[1:46:45] <%Rumbutt> it's physical dps and casters but yeah
[1:46:45] <jorniev> thats awesome
[1:46:48] <peachy996> @BlackStarAura Eh. Only Liam
[1:46:49] <+kortin> aww, we're not getting more jobquests with Endwalker? I thought the role quests were a thing for story reasons
[1:46:50] <%shurtal> i'm ready for 5 years from now when EA announces they've canceled the new Mass Effect game 2 years before, please get excite for new live service game
[1:46:50] <%walternatorz> magic dps and physical dps
[1:46:51] <tanarath> focus on one class first
[1:46:58] <+Bigbossman91> @BlackStarAura you clearly never met Drack
[1:47:08] <peachy996> Liam is trash and PB was annoying but the other 4 were alright to good
[1:47:11] <Blank9> yeah 3 is absolutely better than people give it credit for
[1:47:14] <metalsiren31> And then suddenly you have to do Heavensward EX's
[1:47:17] <%walternatorz> and expansion jobs start at 70
[1:47:17] <%BioHunter> doing all of the role quests also gives u bonus cutscenes
[1:47:18] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat it's not melee/ranged, it's phys/magical
[1:47:20] <Coystick> You thinking about any other nostalgia series you wanna regorge?
[1:47:22] <+FennecZephyr> I usually want to have 3 classes at cap so I can basically take whatever role is needed
[1:47:24] <%bread_assassin> So did casters not get a role questline in Shadowbringers?
[1:47:26] <%BlackStarAura> @bigbossman91 I forgot his name. That’s how much Andromeda sucked
[1:47:29] <+AmericanSkidd> for reasons
[1:47:30] <Inparadisum> cool, ive been leveling as black mage but wasnt sure if i needed more
[1:47:33] <%JohnAtDawn> I got everything to 80 and somehow kept my sanity. Need to work on Crafters
[1:47:34] <+FennecZephyr> Otherwise I main tank for queue time

[1:48:05] <yourliteraldog> Lewd
[1:48:13] <%Lion_kun> Batarians were totally wasted in ME3
[1:48:13] <$realm_forge> Killing batarians makes pat wet
[1:48:14] <%walternatorz> ewww they made a batarian ai?
[1:48:15] <5pencer1001> either the krogan they sent would be dead in one generation or completely overrun the entire galaxy
[1:48:19] <%StaceMcGate> Killing Batarians is wrong
[1:48:20] <+Ghufufin> moist for batarian murder
[1:48:24] <%Lion_kun> All the other races got a cool showing. Batarians got squat.
[1:48:24] <dawarw0lf> @blank9 Just because the ending is the worst (I say only without the extended cut dlc otherwise it’s passable and fine for me) and write off 90% of the game. It’s so unfair
[1:48:28] <IntrepidEye> killing batarians!? oh shit I'm already sloshing around in my armor
[1:48:29] <%AncelDeLambert> goddamn Cardassians!... uh, I mean, Batarians!

[1:48:47] <%coward_man> this is just Batarian guantanamo
[1:48:50] <Alzero83> Batarian filth,,,,
[1:48:59] <+Ches_Neckbeard> not killing the batarians would be wrong. kill them all. Become Gul Dukat
[1:49:00] <jorniev> oh sure...
[1:49:02] <Vantesla> I kinda wish Arrival was gated off to not be accessed or accepted till after the suicide mission. Given when it originally released and chronological order.
[1:49:03] <%Lion_kun> ME3's problem was not just the ending, that game has some high highs and some lows lowsssss
[1:49:03] <%BlackStarAura> Spoonheads and Four-eyes UNITE!
[1:49:05] <williamrooster> BATARIAAAAANS!!
[1:49:05] <%idyota> Batarians LOVE slavery

[1:49:18] <+redthebaron> it is incredible that shepard whole anti batarian storyline get's a dlc
[1:49:18] <Madinki> #NotAlLBatarians come on y'all get it trending!
[1:49:19] <+Rewrench> the terrible thing with ME3 ending isnt just the ending its the revalation that the story was never thought out and nothing mattered
[1:49:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> THEY ARE THO
[1:49:28] <IntrepidEye> kinda funny how even in 1 the Batarians were more evil than the Geth
[1:49:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> WE SHOULDN'T
[1:49:36] <%Monkeyweed21> right you dont actually meet a batarian civilian until 3
[1:49:42] <5pencer1001> ME3 is an excellent example of story fracture
[1:49:52] <%BlackStarAura> Bray from Omega was ok
[1:49:53] <dawarw0lf> @rewrench That would have happened regardless of what has done. Dark matter would have been equally as bad.
[1:49:54] <peachy996> Yeah people saying "Only the ending was bad" about ME3 I can't ever agree with
[1:50:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Upgrade guide?
[1:50:07] <5pencer1001> GOT being the most recent and high profile example of story fracture
[1:50:10] <%walternatorz> the batarians are the vermin
[1:50:18] <+tinytinykittycat> they should
[1:50:23] <%BlackStarAura> There’s an upgrade in one of these rooms
[1:50:25] <mr_saturday93> kill all the hyumans
[1:50:26] <Vantesla> @rewrench I agree the story was rushed and even in many of the good character moments if you pick it apart some incidents are pretty dumb in how they came about.
[1:50:29] <%BlackStarAura> OK
[1:50:31] <%Monkeyweed21> hey look the dlc has upgrades
[1:50:37] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 Ok fine. It’s the ending coup and some of the stuff after Thessia but the rest is fine.
[1:50:38] <Mutsu2k> @rewrench yeah the ROBOTS ALWAYS BAD by starchild is what frustrated me the most
[1:50:39] <jorniev> a bunch of ME3 was bad its just that it still had good and GREAT bits
[1:50:44] <%bread_assassin> @Monkeyweed21 You mean see or talk to? Because there was that preacher dude on Omega in 2.
[1:51:06] <peachy996> mmmm I will only say the Tuchanka Arc is great
[1:51:07] <%walternatorz> wait a second, I thought birds were only used to show scale
[1:51:14] <+Ches_Neckbeard> 300k isn't even as many as covid has killed. is it really even a genocide?
[1:51:14] <Blank9> the big plus to ME3 is the gameplay is the best in the series
[1:51:16] <peachy996> Maybe Citadel DLC
[1:51:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @bread_assassin the Batarian Hegemony is space North Korea so the only batarians that can leave it a re criminals and terrorists
[1:51:23] <dawarw0lf> It’s not a bunch of 3 that is bad but I’m done arguing with people that haven’t touched the game since it game out. Fucking god.
[1:51:25] <%watts121> lol I forgot this was a stealth misison
[1:51:28] <Blank9> so the glue between all the good/bad/great stuff is solid
[1:51:29] <%walternatorz> a door!
[1:51:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Ayo listen. Total war style Batarian space
[1:51:32] <yourliteraldog> I appreciated legion becoming robo jesus
[1:51:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Take Batarian colonies
[1:51:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> and leave them nothing
[1:51:42] <%teefpal> LUL
[1:51:44] <AluxStreams> It is raining very hard to be fair.
[1:51:46] <%AncelDeLambert> zero alerts raised
[1:51:50] <%machshop> the greatest commando in the galaxy
[1:51:50] <%AncelDeLambert> well done, Solid Snake
[1:51:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Send Batarians to Black holes
[1:51:52] <peachy996> Oh trust me I've touched Mass Effect 3 many many times
[1:51:56] <dawarw0lf> 3 is a good game and I’m tired of people saying otherwise
[1:52:02] <Vantesla> @peachy996 Tuchanka is nice. As long one has everyone prior alive LUL
[1:52:07] <Blank9> can't be seen if no one's alive to report you
[1:52:07] <+AmericanSkidd> just like snake wouldve done
[1:52:08] <stantheman_97> are they using human helmets?
[1:52:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> @dawarw0lf wrong
[1:52:14] <peachy996> It's why I hate the negatives so much
[1:52:15] <jorniev> steal batarians colonies and just iradiate them just for spite
[1:52:15] <+Bigbossman91> ME3>ME2
[1:52:17] <CrimsonGargoyle> @dawarw0lf better grab an energy drink then LUL
[1:52:19] <%AncelDeLambert> 3 is NOT a good game and I remember very well how not good it was
[1:52:19] <Madinki> EAT THESE FOR EYED FUCKS. EAT THEIR WORLDS AND LEAVE THEM NOTHING
[1:52:19] <OldManDeckardCain> isn't this one of the maps in the multiplayer LUL
[1:52:21] <%andrewofbob> Pat, would you hate baterians less if I told you that in the multiplayer, their heavy melee is practically a Falcon Punch?
[1:52:22] <%bread_assassin> @Monkeyweed21 Alright, I guess that guy is technically a criminal, then.
[1:52:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> what a thrill
[1:52:30] <rekinom> Chat is Andromeda as bad as everyone says it is?
[1:52:32] <%teefpal> really all of the ME trilogy is "good", it's just great in some ways and deeply. deeply flawed in others
[1:52:37] <5pencer1001> Shamus Young has basically written and entire book on Mass Effect and why it fails to satisfy
[1:52:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> with darkness and silence through the night
[1:52:45] <+Bigbossman91> @rekinom no
[1:52:47] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @rekinom it's worse
[1:52:48] <dawarw0lf> I remember that pat’s chat is god damn annoying at times.
[1:52:50] <5pencer1001> you can find the post on twenty sided
[1:52:50] <peachy996> Andromeda's major crime is that the story is dull
[1:52:50] <SiameseSneeze> NO they're Batarians, they don't deserve rights
[1:52:51] <+tinytinykittycat> whole system
[1:52:52] <DSD24> Pat's gonna love this DLC
[1:52:52] <CrimsonGargoyle> @rekinom worse, it's boring
[1:52:54] <%AncelDeLambert> I wouldn't know, 3 burned me hard enough that I never touched Andromeda
[1:52:54] <+Alig200> @rekinom no, but its also a case of your mileage may vary.
[1:52:55] <IntrepidEye> 3 was solid but even disregarding the ending had a lot of issues. One big one being everything about Kai Leng
[1:52:57] <Dunmarkh> @rekinom at launch, yesyesyesyesyes
[1:53:01] <+AmericanSkidd> compared to being converted by reapers its mercy
[1:53:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BATARIAN EATER!
[1:53:05] <peachy996> and amateur models
[1:53:06] <Alzero83> Batarian Filth
[1:53:08] <peachy996> rigging
[1:53:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> no wait
[1:53:11] <holyxgrale> God kai leng is so fucking stupid
[1:53:16] <%amaranthos> BATARIANS DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:53:16] <Blank9> kai leng, the cereal killer
[1:53:29] <%Ranryu692> ending foibles aside, ME3's biggest problem is that they clearly needed a few more years of development to put in and flesh out everything they wanted to do
[1:53:29] <%bread_assassin> @rekinom Gameplay's decent, I guess, but the story and characters are just bad.
[1:53:31] <OldManDeckardCain> mass effect 3 is a terrible game, people are too focused on the bad ending to remember how bad that shit was
[1:53:33] <Dunmarkh> @rekinom gameplay is allegedly good though
[1:53:33] <DSD24> Kai Leng is a bitch
[1:53:34] <%AncelDeLambert> no no no, Leon, you pick up the enemy and throw them into the trash chute
[1:53:36] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 That and animation has been a part of mass effect since 1
[1:53:40] <jorniev> man kia lang is so lame
[1:53:40] <peachy996> Hide your potted plants from Kai Leng
[1:53:41] <+RowenCleric> keep rolling
[1:53:46] <%Solid_Stro> @holyxgrale He was studying the blade while Shepard was slamming the qussy Kappa
[1:53:48] <DSD24> ME3 gameplay wise was great
[1:53:53] <%Ranryu692> but instead they decided to do what they could and then polish it a bunch
[1:53:54] <$realm_forge> You’d think they’d be better shots what with the four eyes and all
[1:54:01] <%count_bob> @rekinom I liked Andromeda personally.
[1:54:07] <yourliteraldog> CRANE PUZZELS
[1:54:08] <OldManDeckardCain> me 3 gameplay is just worse gears of war
[1:54:15] <peachy996> I like Andromeda warts and all
[1:54:16] <%count_bob> It fixed the biggest problem with the story in ME trilogy.
[1:54:20] <+Alig200> lolwut
[1:54:21] <+Peacefrog7> guys remember pat has not played me3 yet dont spoil
[1:54:22] <Madinki> CRRRRRAAAAAINE PUZLEEEEEEEEEE
[1:54:23] <%Ranryu692> *better gears of war
[1:54:24] <%count_bob> REapers are unbeatable.
[1:54:28] <holyxgrale> Solid_Stro FeelsBadMan
[1:54:33] <%Mr_Pylon> you need time stop for this
[1:54:33] <$realm_forge> Quick pat build fortifications
[1:54:33] <%teefpal> I still remember reading those EA documents that wanted ME3 done in a year, like Assassins Creed.
[1:54:39] <holyxgrale> FeelsAmazingMan
[1:54:42] <dawarw0lf> @count_bob I don’t like andromeda enough to defend it like I do 3
[1:54:46] <IntrepidEye> Gears wish it played like ME3
[1:54:52] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you forgot the upgrade guide
[1:54:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:55:00] <Vantesla> I think if redoing the ME3 story the parts with Cerberus should been more gray till mid game. Make it more unsure if Cerberus is indoctrinated or not. But Mars gave that away immediately LUL
[1:55:00] <peachy996> I think Pat knows the greatest hits from 3 but he doesn't know the story to the Citadel DLC. That one I'm keeping mum on
[1:55:08] <OldManDeckardCain> people are crazy nowadays LUL
[1:55:15] <holyxgrale> PatStaresAt did you play mass effect with mods or nah?
[1:55:16] <%hrbeck_> Every year a mass effect! Each more disappointing than the last!
[1:55:24] <peachy996> Nice whiff
[1:55:25] <stantheman_97> LUL
[1:55:29] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[1:55:32] <IntrepidEye> what was that noise?
[1:55:37] <%teefpal> @hrbeck_ basically yeah, they wanted to AC3 it
[1:55:43] <%andrewofbob> Citadel DLC is arguably the peak of the whole series
[1:55:44] <%count_bob> @dawarw0lf Fair enough. I still like the game quite a bit.
[1:55:45] <%Rumbutt> fucking batarians
[1:55:54] <rekinom> Thanks for the answers chat
[1:56:00] <+unhuggable1> why does she even want to get rescued
[1:56:04] <rekinom> Pat are you going to play Andromeda so I don't have to ?
[1:56:12] <slix3431> Pat commence Kill all Batarian's protocol
[1:56:15] <holyxgrale> He's badarian
[1:56:17] <Blank9> peak of series is all the fun vanguard shield/charge/melee nonsense
[1:56:18] <Alzero83> Batarian Filth
[1:56:18] <homestylewaffles> bop
[1:56:21] <dawarw0lf> @count_bob I still have only beaten it once
[1:56:21] <%bread_assassin> All Batarians are bad.
[1:56:22] <jorniev> LUL
[1:56:26] <DSD24> That was so blasé
[1:56:28] <+DatAsuna> that's just harbinger's voice actor
[1:56:28] <%StaceMcGate> Shepard, Kenson
[1:56:33] <Vantesla> Citadel is great though the idea taking a week or two to unwind during Earth being harvested is just... LUL
[1:56:36] <%watts121> Andromeda ain't part of the remaster...thank god.
[1:56:44] <+Qexec> Always be carryin' in case of Batarian
[1:56:44] <5pencer1001> is that chakwas sister?
[1:56:45] <Madinki> NOT CUT OUT HIS EYES SO HIS SOUL CAN'T ESCAPE
[1:56:45] <jorniev> BATARIAN HAVE WET CARDBOARD JAWS
[1:56:46] <%machshop> Old Kelly
[1:56:56] <Mattais88> I always laugh at her being in the schlubby spacer clothes
[1:57:00] <%StaceMcGate> RACIST
[1:57:01] <AluxStreams> Remember to upgrade Grandma Kenson.
[1:57:02] <%count_bob> I like Andromeda, and I feel like a sequel to it could be better.
[1:57:02] <+Alig200> @Vantesla wasn't it just like 3 days or something lol?
[1:57:07] <%walternatorz> see if she'll do all the work
[1:57:07] <%Mr_Pylon> wait don
[1:57:08] <%Ranryu692> @Vantesla it actually makes sense considering the justification they give for why you're stuck on the citadel
[1:57:09] <+redthebaron> their awful battarian visag
[1:57:11] <%coward_man> they just wear human helmets which blocks half their eyes
[1:57:11] <+AmericanSkidd> OH THATS SO DUMB HE HAS 4 EYES
[1:57:11] <%count_bob> Pity we will never gone.
[1:57:20] <%andrewofbob> Level up your squadmate, Pat
[1:57:20] <Dunmarkh> UPGRADE her
[1:57:24] <blackjack8182> Damn Batarians
[1:57:35] <stantheman_97> why do their helmets have two eye visors?
[1:57:35] <%machshop> hey it's that area from Control
[1:57:38] <%bearwagon> LUL
[1:57:38] <%Mr_Pylon> don't batarians have multiple pairs of eyes? but that helmet?
[1:57:38] <+JustToWatch> lol
[1:57:39] <%Maids4lyfe> wait wouldn't only having 2 eyes on their helmets fuck up their four-eyed vision?
[1:57:40] <alwayspronking> LUL
[1:57:42] <dawarw0lf> @count_bob I think a dlc tie in for mass effect 4 would be best and what should happen
[1:57:44] <holyxgrale> God mass effect 4 could take place centuries after the trilogy
[1:57:44] <%hrbeck_> Uyuuuuuugh batarians
[1:57:45] <williamrooster> lol
[1:57:46] <5pencer1001> man shepard ate shit there
[1:57:46] <karl_rex> F
[1:57:46] <%barrakuta371> yeah those guys did great LUL
[1:57:46] <+Shady_Zaku> YA DOOIIED
[1:57:47] <+tinytinykittycat> lol
[1:57:47] <+senfood> CRAZY TALK
[1:57:50] <peachy996> I want to see Andromeda get a polished sequel the same way ME1 got
[1:57:55] <%RaziWraith> SO I guess he wasn't looking at this health???
[1:57:56] <Vantesla> @alig200 seem way more given the fights and etc. obviously all can be done in a few hours, but got the impression at least a week.
[1:57:59] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:58:03] <jorniev> THSI IS THE POWER OF CRAZY TALK REQUIEM
[1:58:03] <AluxStreams> nvm i guess lol
[1:58:05] <GustauveVIII> Charge targetting is better in ME3
[1:58:06] <dawarw0lf> She got no points!
[1:58:08] <%BlackStarAura> It’s as if going into cover is a think
[1:58:09] <%Byronic_dreamer> They did great
[1:58:10] <%BlackStarAura> Thing
[1:58:10] <$realm_forge> YOURE DOING GREAT PAT
[1:58:12] <dawarw0lf> She’s the WORST
[1:58:12] <+UndeadParadoxy> andromeda is good actually
[1:58:12] <+AmericanSkidd> 4 eyes, two eye holes, PROFIT
[1:58:15] <tengel66> ooooooo
[1:58:15] <Mattais88> Why do batarian prison guards only have two eyes on their masks?
[1:58:20] <%codedoomboy> Great
[1:58:20] <%count_bob> I don't like Shepard anymore. I don't want him to be the main character.
[1:58:23] <metalsiren31> Ain't even got points
[1:58:29] <%ArchimerCXV> allthoughts nothinks
[1:58:33] <5pencer1001> Mass Effect the Universe is actually depleted, they just need to make new sci fi stuff
[1:58:35] <tattleworm> totally fixed in 3, just put up with it for one more hour
[1:58:35] <%JamesCorck> Wait what?
[1:58:37] <Blank9> maybe 2 of their eyes aren't good at seeing
[1:58:40] <%JamesCorck> What bug are you talking about?
[1:58:40] <GustauveVIII> It gets MUCH better in ME3
[1:58:54] <%Ranryu692> yeah ME2 plays like shit compared to 3
[1:58:55] <jorniev> DONT WORRY ITS CRAZY BUSTED IN 3
[1:58:55] <%dooscent> yeah it's better in 3, and then in andromeda they give you a jetpack, and platforms don't become an issue
[1:58:57] <%BlackStarAura> Bringing Shepard back yet again would be beating a long dead horse. Let him/her rest
[1:59:02] <peachy996> That may be but if they're going to do Ryder again, Ryder needs to grow and not be a Star Lord knockoff
[1:59:03] <dawarw0lf> I’m seeing too much “andromeda is good” that needs to be directed to me3.
[1:59:16] <%teefpal> @5pencer1001 ME4 is going to be fan-pandering that make the Citadel DLC make subtle
[1:59:17] <Blank9> I mean humans have 4 limbs that have jointed digits on them and barely use their feet for the same thing as hands
[1:59:18] <%count_bob> ME3 good too.
[1:59:20] <AluxStreams> safety dance yeyeye
[1:59:21] <ThatGuyThere03> YEAAHHHHHHHH
[1:59:23] <holyxgrale> Not enough flow
[1:59:24] <metalsiren31> Jensen does it better
[1:59:26] <%amaranthos> Jensen steppin
[1:59:26] <+D00msDayDan> your friends don't dance and if they don't dance then they're no friends of mine
[1:59:27] <%shurtal> but shittier, cause Shephard is a worse dancer
[1:59:28] <%Wurmspawn> @JamesCorck He's tlking about when shepard says, "can't lock on to target" when crossing across different levels of the map. It doesn't alwasy work rgiht.
[1:59:28] <%machshop> i love the Jensen dance
[1:59:29] <+Bigbossman91> @dawarw0lf both are good
[1:59:30] <BTR_NOODLE> the cover shuffle!
[1:59:31] <+AmericanSkidd> and of course its more stiff for shepard
[1:59:31] <Coystick> Shepard wishes he fucked as hard as Jenson
[1:59:32] <peachy996> Um...The multiplayer in 3 is good!
[1:59:37] <IntrepidEye> i just want a ME3 mod so I can play Krogan Shepard and headbutt everything to death
[1:59:38] <%AncelDeLambert> JENSEN I need more monitors!
[1:59:38] <jorniev> NOT as good, but it has spirit
[1:59:39] <%Jmann1892> I never asked for this
[1:59:40] <yourliteraldog> do the jensen
[1:59:41] <stantheman_97> you can dance if you want to
[1:59:48] <Madinki> Fun Fact about Batarian culture. They believe their soul escapes the body through their eyes after dying. CUT THEM OUT SO THEY CAN'T ESCAPE THIS MORTAL PLANE!
[1:59:49] <slix3431> Hey Pat, remember the karate chop npc animation during conversations?
[1:59:50] <%peyodogo> if you aim at your feet and tap to move side to side you do a weird lil dance-like movement
[1:59:53] <%peyodogo> its funky
[1:59:53] <5pencer1001> Andromeda is like: what if we made a ME1 with boring aliens and no soul?
[1:59:55] <%count_bob> Shep doesn't control like a tank in ME3 like he does in ME2.
[1:59:56] <%Dakuu75> had to mute the stream for a hot minute while I dodged 200 lightning bolts in FFX
[1:59:58] <+Alig200> you were stuck on a batarian lol
[2:00:00] <%walternatorz> pat plays video games to avoid bossy women
[2:00:00] <jorniev> wait IS THE ME3 multiplayer BACK?
[2:00:03] <dawarw0lf> @peachy996 And least we can all agree on that…i hope
[2:00:07] <CrimsonGargoyle> Woolie taught us well with Halo. Don't fuck with Mass Effect fans, they won't shut up about their opinion on the games LUL
[2:00:07] <%dooscent> @5pencer1001 but you have a jetpack
[2:00:08] <%machshop> do you think Jensen will get a third game
[2:00:21] <%Jeemukun> if batarians have 4 eyes why their helmets only have two eye lenses
[2:00:21] <%machshop> LUL
[2:00:22] <Dunmarkh> LUL LUL
[2:00:23] <yourliteraldog> A POSE
[2:00:24] <Coystick> NOOO
[2:00:24] <jorniev> @Dakuu75 you did it!?
[2:00:25] <homestylewaffles> Aaaaayyyy
[2:00:25] <%YoungGroose> A
[2:00:25] <stantheman_97> YEAH
[2:00:26] <+DatAsuna> @jorniev no, but you can still play it on the original version lol
[2:00:26] <holyxgrale> Pat you can do a sigma male maneuver by charging the shotgun and then MID CHARGE fire the shot
[2:00:27] <dekkitout> AAAAA!
[2:00:27] <+AmericanSkidd> this is the best
[2:00:28] <%coward_man> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:00:29] <%Mr_Pylon> Yay!
[2:00:29] <%Gorshum> LUL
[2:00:30] <dawarw0lf> God I’m doing everything I can to ignore pat playing arrival aren’t I?
[2:00:30] <%teefpal> @machshop Nope
[2:00:32] <Teras_ode> LUL
[2:00:34] <%machshop> she's just channeling her energy
[2:00:37] <CrimsonGargoyle> A for arrival
[2:00:39] <%Dakuu75> psaBig A POSING psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[2:00:39] <AluxStreams> A for Arrival. :)
[2:00:40] <mr_saturday93> The superior pose
[2:00:43] <%walternatorz> you allowed her to become paralyzed
[2:00:44] <yourliteraldog> ASSUME THE POSITION OF POWER
[2:00:44] <Aiutare47> A for Arrival
[2:00:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is so dependent on his charge
[2:00:49] <SaltyAzteca> A for ASSUMING CONTROL
[2:00:50] <peachy996> If they bring back the MP to Legendary edition I'll easily buy it
[2:00:51] <%Solid_Stro> Asserting Dominance!!!
[2:00:53] <%amaranthos> batarians are just the best, no mass effect alien race does it better
[2:00:54] <+toastybites> Battarian A-posing torture
[2:00:55] <IntrepidEye> Jenson is unfortunately dead AF
[2:00:55] <dawarw0lf> Arrival is worst then 3
[2:00:57] <CrimsonGargoyle> ASSUMING DIRECT A-POSE
[2:01:06] <Vantesla> problem bringing Shepard is that negates two of three endings with some space magic involved. Also the whole thing of what conflict during such a time to even have? Andromeda had a good premise of getting far away, but botched everything story wise or obvious animation and etc.
[2:01:09] <holyxgrale> LUL
[2:01:13] <peachy996> Just A Posin
[2:01:14] <+D00msDayDan> you can't trust someone that A-poses
[2:01:15] <5pencer1001> pat did you ever see the video of andromeda where the cutscene was just totally broken?
[2:01:15] <%Dakuu75> @jorniev yeah, and I feel like I need a damn nap now. lol
[2:01:28] <%robuttastic> heard people talking about how a prequel of me taking place during the first contact war would be way cooler than a new sequel and honestly, same
[2:01:29] <%watts121> Didn't Arrival come out like a few months before ME3? Wonder how much time they really had to work on it.
[2:01:30] <%teefpal> @Vantesla Destroy Ending was already confirmed to be the canon ending
[2:01:32] <dawarw0lf> Such a polished and GREAT dlc can’t you tell
[2:01:43] <%shurtal> Canadians would Eh Pose
[2:01:46] <Vantesla> @teefpal By who?
[2:01:48] <dawarw0lf> @teefpal No it’s not
[2:01:50] <%Solid_Stro> That’s how you know she’s indoctrinated
[2:01:54] <CrimsonGargoyle> @shurtal LMFAO
[2:01:55] <tanarath> She's asserting dominance over the computer
[2:02:13] <%coward_man> ME4 trailer confirms Destroy is canon
[2:02:15] <%teefpal> @Vantesla The Next Mass Effect trailer
[2:02:28] <+AmericanSkidd> he put away his gun to pull out his gun
[2:02:28] <%watts121> @robuttastic nope I wanna know what happens to the Milky Way after Reaper War. You gotta remember that the Mass Effect setting itself is more interesting than the storyline was. I'd rather get a continuation of the setting then rehash shit we already know.
[2:02:32] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Solid_Stro every time i see an npc A posing a reapor BRRRRR plays in my head LUL
[2:02:37] <%count_bob> Ah yes, the trailer that says noting.
[2:02:46] <DSD24> "Can't target them"
[2:02:56] <%Rumbutt> ME3 is much better about vanguard charge iirc
[2:02:56] <peachy996> I'm not putting any thought in ME4's CGI trailer. Anything could happen
[2:02:57] <%Ranryu692> it's about to get much better
[2:03:02] <%coward_man> @count_bob the trailer shows you destroyed mass relays
[2:03:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> "Are you alive? Stop it" - Patthew
[2:03:06] <dawarw0lf> @vantesla By people who think the trailer showing dead reapers=destroy ignoring that some reapers will die regardless of when you make the choice
[2:03:20] <%amaranthos> psaBig psaHoldon
[2:03:24] <%JoshManVGH> "Can't bleach the target"
[2:03:31] <%AncelDeLambert> uuuuuuh
[2:03:33] <mighty_fine_trousers> Did they repurpose alliance gear?
[2:03:33] <%Dakuu75> the power of A pose
[2:03:36] <peachy996> All we know about ME4 is that Liara will be there and I don't even like her lol
[2:03:37] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[2:03:38] <Dunmarkh> based
[2:03:40] <ape_hawk> wicked ship farts
[2:03:40] <AluxStreams> Shepard really just loves killing batarians.
[2:03:41] <stantheman_97> YEAH ROASTED BATARIAN
[2:03:42] <%andrewofbob> Is that a custom feature for shuttles?
[2:03:42] <SiameseSneeze> YEAH Burn those disgusting Batarians!
[2:03:45] <Teras_ode> yeah crispy
[2:03:45] <%JamesCorck> It's fiiiiine, there are plenty of Batarians to go around.
[2:03:48] <%JamesCorck> >_>;
[2:03:48] <%AncelDeLambert> call me crazy but I don't think you can just cause a vehicle to backfire at will
[2:03:49] <%JamesCorck> Oh wait!
[2:04:01] <DSD24> They don't take kindly to anyone
[2:04:02] <KeystoneA2> Oh boy, the war crime DLC
[2:04:04] <%watts121> Honestly if we get ME4 at all will be a miracle, cuz I'm pretty sure EA is gonna take Bioware to the back and shoot it after DA4 fails.
[2:04:06] <+Alig200> @count_bob don't they get destroyed in all of the endings, even if only temporarily?
[2:04:13] <OldManDeckardCain> her face LUL
[2:04:13] <yourliteraldog> Her face looks fucked
[2:04:15] <%bread_assassin> I don't think ANY species would.
[2:04:16] <+kortin> her face looks a lot younger than she sounds
[2:04:19] <%StaceMcGate> HER FACE IS AWFUL
[2:04:21] <%StaceMcGate> LOOK AT HER EYES
[2:04:22] <%walternatorz> blow it up!

[2:04:31] <5pencer1001> faaaaaaaaaace
[2:04:33] <yourliteraldog> HER FACE
[2:04:35] <Vantesla> @teefpal So Geth get SOL/betrayed and the dumb Star Child will be right probably later as a new AI is being fought LUL Honestly ME is done giving all original creators of story and character designs left Bioware, fired, or moved to a different team. ME3 made me not care as to why never touch Andromeda LUL
[2:04:36] <slix3431> FUCK THIS LIFE SPEED
[2:04:37] <DSD24> That's a dumb name
[2:04:40] <asurite_warrior> she looks like she has some sort of fetal alcholism with her face
[2:04:40] <+AmericanSkidd> yeah, years...
[2:04:43] <yourliteraldog> SMOL FACE
[2:04:44] <%AncelDeLambert> wrong wrong wrong wrong, wrong wrong wrong wrong
[2:04:45] <%OrangeMDT> Why she so uggo tho

[2:04:50] <%AncelDeLambert> You're wrong. You're wrong.
[2:04:51] <%Arancet> whats wrong with her faaaaace
[2:04:51] <peachy996> She's got bad potatoface.
[2:04:51] <%Ranryu692> @AncelDeLambert takes them an extra six months to attack, though
[2:04:52] <wolfen091> oof bad face, was this before frosbite?
[2:04:53] <%JoshManVGH> What's wrong with her faaaaaace!
[2:04:55] <spongeofmystery> Janeway would be proud
[2:04:59] <$realm_forge> Her face looks like bent cardboard
[2:05:00] <ape_hawk> heh heh, thrust
[2:05:01] <ExpressNode> Big name for essentially throwing a big space rock like a cave man
[2:05:03] <dekkitout> Phrasing, boom
[2:05:04] <mr_saturday93> and kill BILLIONS
[2:05:10] <%count_bob> Lots of folks are kinda...
[2:05:10] <Blank9> on one hand, war crime
[2:05:13] <CrimsonGargoyle> how tf has this not been used in other wars LUL
[2:05:15] <AmuserName> BRING DOWN THE SKY, BUT AGAINST BATARIANS LUL
[2:05:15] <Blank9> on the other, it's against batarians
[2:05:15] <dawarw0lf> Guys come on. Her face is tired. Give her a break
[2:05:16] <SiameseSneeze> They're Batarians, it doesn't count
[2:05:16] <%BlackStarAura> Guide those hips
[2:05:19] <tanarath> BIG terrorism
[2:05:19] <%count_bob> not great looking. In Mass Effect.
[2:05:20] <KeystoneA2> @wolfen091 This was 2010-ish
[2:05:21] <peachy996> THEN DON'T DESTROY ONE
[2:05:26] <Vantesla> Remake/remaster did a number on many faces LUL
[2:05:26] <%JoshManVGH> ....huh
[2:05:28] <mr_saturday93> Mass Effect ops: The Line
[2:05:29] <Teras_ode> they are batarians, it's more like a war service
[2:05:29] <5pencer1001> wouldnt it be great if it just shot the asteroid into earth?
[2:05:30] <%blankwaffle> blankwaffle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! so I've gotten back into wrestling after like 10 years and have gotten really big into this women's Japanese promotion called stardom its pretty good if you haven't heard of it. sorry for the random :)
[2:05:31] <+akscully> physics baby!
[2:05:32] <%Blackleafx> Bring down the sky electric boogaloo
[2:05:33] <%AncelDeLambert> you can decalibrate it
[2:05:33] <peachy996> ARRGGGH THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE PLOT
[2:05:37] <+D00msDayDan> "We'd destroy the relay, but it would also kill every Batarian in the system!" "'but?'"
[2:05:38] <%Ynkubus_> SPACE UNGA BUNGA
[2:05:39] <Dunmarkh> WE WILL EFFECT THIS ,ASS
[2:05:39] <%Mr_Pylon> If you hit it with enough Mass it'll have some Effect
[2:05:40] <falyden> God that's fuking genocide
[2:05:40] <%andrewofbob> Shunt it into the star it orbits
[2:05:40] <HeroToxiko> it will have been EFFECTED
[2:05:43] <%UvBenServed> Enough mass will effect it
[2:05:45] <+AmericanSkidd> does that matter though if its moved?
[2:05:45] <Dunmarkh> MASS FUCK
[2:05:46] <ape_hawk> question: can you theoretically mass effect a planet?
[2:05:58] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah but what happens when you break the mass manipulating super launcher? Nothing good I bet
[2:05:58] <dekkitout> Isaac Newton is a lethal motherfucker
[2:06:10] <zhenthrim213> and?
[2:06:11] <+AmericanSkidd> The Mu relay was moved but still worked
[2:06:12] <%Blackleafx> Kill them all Peter
[2:06:13] <williamrooster> wouldn't it just teleport the asteroid
[2:06:15] <+senfood> Oh, that's all?
[2:06:15] <%Wurmspawn> So, question: Why DIDN'T soveriegn just use this relay when the Citadel didn't work as it originally intended because the keepers didn't activate thanks tot he prothean reprogamin?
[2:06:16] <AluxStreams> Parts of this DLC have big Outer Wilds vibes, like the music in this scene.
[2:06:16] <CrimsonGargoyle> 300K? that's low LUL
[2:06:17] <Alzero83> Batarian Filth
[2:06:17] <%watts121> @ape_hawk yes they do it to Asteroids all the time in ME.
[2:06:19] <%Rumbutt> well, they ARE batarians so
[2:06:20] <stantheman_97> the reaper's ftl tech would make moving it pointless
[2:06:20] <%amaranthos> here I go genociding again
[2:06:29] <%teefpal> @ape_hawk Yeah there's nothing in the lore to discount it, it'd just take a massive amount of eezo
[2:06:30] <ape_hawk> oh, so half of what covid killed, got it
[2:06:30] <%JoshManVGH> Imagine a super nova that pushes mass for a whole star system to near 0.
[2:06:35] <CrimsonGargoyle> @williamrooster THAT'D BE METAL AF
[2:06:36] <%Jmann1892> Its not a warcrime if its done to Batarians
[2:06:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> A supernova tends to destroy everything within a few lightyears though...
[2:06:52] <Blank9> really shaking those shoulders
[2:06:54] <dawarw0lf> @wurmspawn Because that makes the harvest supper quick. This is just a backup plan
[2:06:55] <%QueequegTheater> They're going to die either way. The only question is whether the rest of the galaxy with them
[2:07:05] <tanarath> Uh oh
[2:07:06] <Vantesla> Balak tried to kill 3 million humans on one planet. You just being a nicer Balak that also destroy a system vs a planet LUL
[2:07:07] <yourliteraldog> Terroism
[2:07:12] <DSD24> Oh god its Shepard
[2:07:13] <+Alig200> @Wurmspawn The citadel is much bigger than a mass relay isn't it? Perhaps its a range thing. No clue personally though lol.
[2:07:20] <ape_hawk> title drop
[2:07:20] <dawarw0lf> The voice acting….it’s not great
[2:07:24] <peachy996> Arrival get it
[2:07:27] <tanarath> 'A reaper artifact'
[2:07:29] <peachy996> she said the thing
[2:07:31] <Mutsu2k> HE SAID THE THING @PatStaresAt
[2:07:31] <%Wurmspawn> @dawarw0lf But activating the citadel manually was so much harder to do.
[2:07:35] <+Shady_Zaku> Totally not code for "kill Shepard"
[2:07:42] <%watts121> The Reapers have to cheat, cuz despite what Hackett constantly says in ME3...the Reapers totally can be defeated Conventionally...
[2:07:44] <%coward_man> it's a big ass rock
[2:07:44] <%machshop> no iraq is on earth
[2:07:47] <%Rain_Mage> Time to pull a Zeon
[2:07:53] <Madinki> IT'S BRING DOWN THE SKY: BATARIAN EDITION
[2:07:59] <%Blackleafx> colony droooop
[2:08:03] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[2:08:06] <%JoshManVGH> @thomasoftroy Oh man, and the Mass Relay could probably launch more of the debris at FTL speeds to other nearby systems. This is a TERRIBLE idea!
[2:08:07] <dawarw0lf> @wurmspawn Because of what the prottheans did on iillos
[2:08:10] <+Shady_Zaku> SEIG ZEOOON
[2:08:14] <5pencer1001> Mass Effects overall arcing story really be about avoiding and/or stranding the reapers in dark space. them actually showing up kills the franchise
[2:08:14] <+flexin_apex> @madinki Right lol
[2:08:15] <%count_bob> See, my favorite part of the DLC is right here.
[2:08:15] <holyxgrale> What is considered conventional here
[2:08:21] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt are you uploading part 11 tonight?
[2:08:23] <%coward_man> that rock is so big it has gravity
[2:08:25] <%AncelDeLambert> that is RIDICULOUSLY precise
[2:08:27] <DSD24> The Reapers are like "Lie Cheat Steal"
[2:08:32] <%Rain_Mage> Axis Shock II Electric Boogaloo
[2:08:33] <+AmericanSkidd> Reaper invasion imminent
[2:08:35] <%machshop> i mean you blow one up in the first game
[2:08:46] <DSD24> Can you run this clock out?
[2:08:46] <%Wurmspawn> @dawarw0lf That's what I'm saying, Soveriegn should've used this relay instead.
[2:08:49] <CrimsonFox777> Wonder what happens if you stay at this choice and let the clock run out.
[2:08:55] <+DatAsuna> individual reapers, but it's not sustainable, any single reaper can take 3 dreadnoughts
[2:08:58] <%machshop> about 2.5 years yeah
[2:08:59] <%robosqueeb> @dsd24 you absolutely can
[2:09:00] <%Blackleafx> pat the clock is ticking
[2:09:01] <peachy996> The reapers don't want a fair fight, they want to clean the galaxy with one good sucker punch
[2:09:03] <AluxStreams> But nobody bothered preparing for it.
[2:09:04] <%Ranryu692> 2 and a half years
[2:09:04] <GustauveVIII> You can actually wait out that timer and get a unique game over screen.
[2:09:09] <%Varlinator> Fun Fact: If you let the countdown finish you actually get a unique game over screen
[2:09:11] <%watts121> @holyxgrale like double the size of the human and turian fleet and equip them all with Thanix Cannons and they could win.
[2:09:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I WISH that was the plot
[2:09:13] <%Ranryu692> 2 years between ME1 and 2, 6 months between 2 and 3
[2:09:14] <%dooscent> also dead reapers can indoctrinate people
[2:09:14] <+D00msDayDan> @dawarw0lf the citadel relay is the only one the reapers out in dark space can connect to
[2:09:15] <5pencer1001> but nobody prepared
[2:09:17] <%dooscent> so...
[2:09:17] <%JoshManVGH> Ha ha, we made BETTER gun!
[2:09:19] <$realm_forge> Aren’t they technologically superior by a few thousand years?
[2:09:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> except they got rid of soerigns corpse because.... Ehhhhh
[2:09:22] <%AncelDeLambert> man, could you imagine that being the plot?
[2:09:22] <dekkitout> I call it, the Massive Effect SeriousSloth
[2:09:24] <%chance_h> What happens if you leave the game on this screen for the entire timer
[2:09:26] <+DatAsuna> the codex literally says it's a 3 to 1 tradeoff to beat a reaper, and only if their specific tactic works and it's alone
[2:09:26] <stantheman_97> but sovereign's corpse indoctrinate them
[2:09:28] <tanarath> Their original plan was to show up before the rachni wars @patstaresat
[2:09:34] <+Alig200> welp, blame the council for that. For deciding to go "reapers? lalalala. we cant hear you, we dont know what that is"
[2:09:37] <%Blackleafx> What are we going to do, throw rocks at them?
[2:09:38] <%Monkeyweed21> also they aren't immediately attacked at the heart of the Galactic community
[2:09:38] <Blank9> still can't make enough that are anywhere on par with a reaper, especially not an army of reapers
[2:09:39] <%SaltkeyAndAckfish> what's wrong with dr kenson's chest?
[2:09:41] <Alzero83> Reaper pulses, nothing bad can come from that.....
[2:09:41] <%Rumbutt> you also don't lose the entire galatic transportation network like they did in the past
[2:09:43] <sirrice77> wouldn't Sovereigns corpse still be dangerous to study?
[2:09:47] <5pencer1001> why dont they just go to the citadel in me3?
[2:09:53] <%barrakuta371> Didn't the Council say they weren't able to recover anything useful from Sovereign?
[2:09:53] <%Maids4lyfe> @realm_forge millions actually
[2:09:54] <%ElkRiverDog> Isn't this from Independence Day?
[2:09:54] <%Blackleafx> The moon is a harsh mistress
[2:09:55] <GuyverTypeL> THE HANGA
[2:09:56] <%Wurmspawn> @dawarw0lf Then how are th reapers "arriving" through this relay?
[2:09:58] <dawarw0lf> @wurmspawn It takes a lot longer as pat just mentioned. They want to kill the leaders firsts. Also he was super fucking egotistical
[2:10:00] <%coward_man> psaWrong
[2:10:05] <%Rumbutt> Yeah it's implied the Rachni wars were caused by Sovreign
[2:10:11] <+AmericanSkidd> oh right the keeps didnt respond to the signal
[2:10:13] <%JoshManVGH> Oh because the Keepers fucked up! @patstaresat
[2:10:14] <%hrbeck_> Time to kill the moon
[2:10:14] <Vantesla> That was practically ignore in ME3... Given we beat Sovereign, made advancement to beat the Collectors using reaper tech. Also in ME3 we do kill Reapers. Should have been a option to win if fully united, but Bioware gave us no you lose end if we do that...
[2:10:15] <%InvaderGrant> the keepers didn't signal or something
[2:10:19] <+DatAsuna> Well also the main advantage the reapers planned on in ME1 was to disconnect you from the relay network so only reapers could use it
[2:10:21] <IntrepidEye> The original Reaper plan was use the Citadel to shut down the relay network and isolate everyone
[2:10:21] <KeystoneA2> Sovereign indoctrinated the Rachni Queens and made them attack everyone
[2:10:21] <%count_bob> Keepers screwed up.
[2:10:23] <%watts121> Rachni were meant to be the original "distraction war" for the Citadel. Geth was the backup.
[2:10:24] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz the Protheans altered the keepers to ignore the signal @PatStaresAt
[2:10:25] <dawarw0lf> @wurmspawn Because they just got to it. It took from the end for 1 till now.
[2:10:26] <williamrooster> I always thought the original idea was that the citadel is the only mass relay powerful enough to bring them out of darkspace
[2:10:27] <tanarath> yeah, the proteans fucked with the citadel
[2:10:29] <holyxgrale> watts121 The reapers never considered the power of garrus's legendary thanix cannon
[2:10:30] <Alzero83> Pre Nut
[2:10:34] <%xcompleasedad> Prothreans cucked them
[2:10:35] <%ForlornCarton> Because the Proteans prevented them from going straight to the citadel
[2:10:36] <%captain_thickthighs> guys so wtf is sigma grindset
[2:10:39] <%ahomeschooldropout> Reminder that the derelict reaper that was killed by a mystery weapon is never mentioned again
[2:10:57] <+AmericanSkidd> the sovereign was like shit now what?
[2:10:58] <Blank9> It's more like ethiopia vs italy in ww2
[2:11:08] <%machshop> it is indeed
[2:11:11] <%MistyMntns> I dont remember anything of Mass Effect.
[2:11:12] <+DatAsuna> It's not
[2:11:14] <spongeofmystery> Klendagon? Yeah
[2:11:15] <Mattais88> It is!
[2:11:16] <+D00msDayDan> @ahomeschooldropout after you get off that reaper it falls into the gravity well of a gas giant and is lost forever
[2:11:18] <yourliteraldog> It was space whales
[2:11:18] <%Jmann1892> The Rachni Wars was Sovereigns first attempt then Saren and the Geth then Sovereign dies and Harbinger uses the Collectors and fails
[2:11:19] <%Garthunox> the signal was meant to be automatic, sovereign was going to manually send it
[2:11:20] <%dooscent> a lot of cool stuff happens in ME3
[2:11:23] <peachy996> I don't recall that from Leviathan
[2:11:25] <%Wurmspawn> Sorry I was misinterpretting that plot dump. Sorry.
[2:11:26] <+ScreamLord> Imagine if the Reapers DID wipe out galactic civilization during the Rachni Wars and then humanity had 45K-48K years to develop
[2:11:26] <%AncelDeLambert> man, fuck the very idea of that DLC, so glad I never played it
[2:11:27] <CrypticMochi> I mean ,ME1 Sovereign had to make plans, because it can’t fight an entire ready fleet
[2:11:27] <tanarath> No, the protheans fucked shit up, it's been several thousand years since shit should have been cleaned out.
[2:11:30] <KeystoneA2> He means the weapon that blew a scar into Klendagon
[2:11:31] <%coward_man> what is super dumb is why sovereign and Saren didn't just walk up to the citadel immediately and blindside everyone
[2:11:32] <5pencer1001> this is an old god story where the old gods wake up. old god stories don't make sense if the old gods wake up
[2:11:35] <peachy996> AND ANYWAY THE LEVIATHANS
[2:11:35] <stormhawk9891> Shouldn't have dropped out of home school
[2:11:38] <%JoshManVGH> Did the protheans alter the Keeprs? I thought the Illium VI said the keepers mutated on their own.
[2:11:38] <+DatAsuna> It's mentioned in leviathan but is in no way the basis
[2:11:39] <%Blackleafx> i like how no matter how advanced technology gets, nothing beats throwing REALLY BIG ROCKS at stuff
[2:11:43] <%AncelDeLambert> stop obsessing over "Space Cthulu", EA, it's embarrasing
[2:11:46] <peachy996> Ugh just...nevermind. We'll get there
[2:11:48] <%hax_metatron> ME3 has some genuinely amazing moments, especially having done the whole trilogy again myself
[2:11:48] <%ahomeschooldropout> I mean the weapon itself, not the derelict reaper
[2:11:53] <+akscully> shields are for nerds
[2:11:54] <%Blackleafx> So how indoctrinated are yall
[2:11:59] <Vantesla> A alien race can kill Reapers. Imagine if teamed up earlier to try incorporate the power into tech... Nah we can't win still...
[2:11:59] <+AmericanSkidd> it was fuckin sick
[2:12:01] <dawarw0lf> @wurmspawn Like your right. He should have used it but he was dumb and WANTED to do it his way because he’s “above the lesser creatures”
[2:12:02] <+flexin_apex> Smell like a …
[2:12:03] <%Varlinator> I N D O C T R I N A T I O N
[2:12:04] <tanarath> mmmmmm, here we go
[2:12:05] <$realm_forge> Oh look it’s eeeeeeeevil
[2:12:07] <%machshop> she totes indoctrinated
[2:12:09] <%coward_man> these guys are super idiots
[2:12:10] <%JoshManVGH> ......
[2:12:10] <+kortin> this is when the indoctrination starts :)
[2:12:11] <DSD24> This won't backfire
[2:12:12] <%watts121> and this should have been the moment that lead into ME3's shepard being indoctrinated
[2:12:14] <%teefpal> @Blackleafx I'm on like 3 levels of indoctrination
[2:12:14] <hat_under_bread> Aka indocrinate him.
[2:12:14] <%hax_metatron> They do a good job of making the journey special in ME3, even if the ending is rushed. Treating the Citadel DLC as the actual ending is the way to go
[2:12:14] <alwayspronking> I love the pants shitting look he had on hit
[2:12:16] <KeystoneA2> I wish they would've said the Crucible is the weapon that killed the Leviathan of Dis, but whoever made it fucked up and killed them instead of the Reapers.
[2:12:16] <dekkitout> @ScreamLord One could say- 40k Kappa
[2:12:16] <Blank9> seeing a vision from reaper tech sounds not great
[2:12:18] <SaltyAzteca> INDOCTRINATION
[2:12:19] <%hrbeck_> @blackleafx like a 4
[2:12:19] <cerberusgate2117> Yes, they are idiots
[2:12:20] <%greencapps> That's a fucking marker
[2:12:20] <+destro_223> HUGE Reaper device glowing
[2:12:22] <holyxgrale> LUL
[2:12:22] <tanarath> IT SHOWED ME, SHEPARD
[2:12:22] <%Blackleafx> Mhmmmmm tasty indoctrination juice
[2:12:24] <DSD24> Roll credits
[2:12:26] <CrimsonGargoyle> dumbest heel LUL
[2:12:27] <+D00msDayDan> SHE SAID IT
[2:12:28] <%Blackleafx> THEN WHYD YOU BRING HIM HERE?
[2:12:30] <%greencapps> literally just a blue marker
[2:12:31] <spongeofmystery> *Laughs in Saren*
[2:12:32] <TourettesPlays> This fight is the fucking BEST
[2:12:33] <%amaranthos> If she was I doctrinated from. the beginning why did she tell Shepard anything about the Alpha relay
[2:12:34] <%MrATheGreat> they're all dumb
[2:12:36] <%Varlinator> Good luck surviving 5 waves here Pat
[2:12:36] <%coward_man> why... bring Shepherd here?
[2:12:36] <Pillagius> Unespexted!
[2:12:37] <peachy996> HUAH
[2:12:38] <GustauveVIII> You don't have to survive the battle. In the original ME2, you get an achievement if you can survive the entire thing. Apparently not in this version though.
[2:12:40] <5pencer1001> why the fuck didnt you just not tell us where the base was
[2:12:41] <Blank9> damn shepard stop getting indoctrinated
[2:12:41] <%maenos2> "i can't let you stop it, so i brought you here instead of trying to dispose fo you along the way"
[2:12:42] <holyxgrale> This whole thing annoyed the fuck out of me
[2:12:44] <Alzero83> Indoctrination Theory was debunked because they were petty about people figuring it out....
[2:12:47] <%Blackleafx> Why didnt she just crash the fucking shuttle you were on?!
[2:12:47] <+flexin_apex> Omg she said it again
[2:12:49] <5pencer1001> and we would have been none the wiser
[2:12:50] <%machshop> cutscene shepard has the worst accuracy
[2:12:50] <ExpressNode> Why did that cutscene look stupid?
[2:12:51] <Blank9> he's like a guy in a zombie series that's been bit three times
[2:12:51] <dawarw0lf> If Shepard could have been indoctrinated by being by it for seconds that’s dumb
[2:12:52] <%JoshManVGH> Oh cool it's the Marker all over again...
[2:12:52] <%bread_assassin> Did she JUST get indoctrinated? Why would she bring him he in the first place? She coulda just said nothing.
[2:12:55] <+destro_223> this fight is a good test
[2:12:57] <williamrooster> you thought i was a scientist but it was me harbinger the whole time!
[2:13:00] <%MistyMntns> The Object is to survive and not Die Pat.
[2:13:00] <ape_hawk> these guys are the worst at shooting an open, incapacitated target, holy shit
[2:13:02] <dawarw0lf> SURIVE PAT
[2:13:04] <+unhuggable1> there used to be an acheivement for beating this
[2:13:05] <%Blackleafx> @bread_assassin Thats gotta have been it
[2:13:06] <mr_saturday93> YOU CAN LOSE THIS
[2:13:09] <%AncelDeLambert> oh your aim SUCKS
[2:13:12] <%watts121> He is here for like what...several days?
[2:13:12] <DSD24> Aww
[2:13:14] <%Varlinator> Well...
[2:13:16] <%Blackleafx> We stopped the arrival
[2:13:16] <%Zalapski> @amaranthos because the plot required her to :)
[2:13:17] <+unhuggable1> you have to lose
[2:13:17] <%Varlinator> you tried
[2:13:17] <%Ipsenscastle> that was odd
[2:13:18] <%watts121> How can he not be indoctrinated?!?!
[2:13:18] <+tinytinykittycat> never stop charging
[2:13:18] <KeystoneA2> ur ded
[2:13:18] <alwayspronking> uhoh
[2:13:19] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:13:19] <%andrewofbob> Bad end?
[2:13:21] <%MrATheGreat> Supposed to lose...
[2:13:23] <dawarw0lf> wow you sucked pat
[2:13:24] <GustauveVIII> In the original ME2, you get an achievement if you can survive the entire thing. Apparently not in this version though.
[2:13:25] <%BlackStarAura> Four or five waves
[2:13:26] <mr_saturday93> gg pat...
[2:13:27] <cerberusgate2117> Mission failed. We'll get em next time!
[2:13:28] <tattleworm> objective survive: failed
[2:13:29] <%BlackStarAura> Never mind
[2:13:30] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[2:13:31] <holyxgrale> DEAD SPACE monkaS
[2:13:31] <%JoshManVGH> Christ
[2:13:32] <%Wurmspawn> There's an achievement for getting so far into that wave on wave sequence, but you're meant to loose.
[2:13:32] <%Ipsenscastle> literally Dead Space 2
[2:13:34] <yourliteraldog> DIRECT CONTROL
[2:13:34] <dawarw0lf> and missed a bunch of dialogue from harbinger
[2:13:34] <%UvBenServed> SPECIAL EYES
[2:13:34] <TourettesPlays> Pat that's a really fun fight and you lost it immediately LUL LUL
[2:13:37] <mr_saturday93> didn't last one round
[2:13:38] <peachy996> Harbinger eyes
[2:13:38] <+destro_223> Well that was fast
[2:13:42] <%MrATheGreat> And like that ending to this dlc is ruined
[2:13:43] <%Blackleafx> do yall liike dead space...
[2:13:45] <%amaranthos> psaWrong
[2:13:46] <+unhuggable1> but the collectors are dead...
[2:13:49] <mr_saturday93> Pat you suck
[2:13:49] <SaltyAzteca> oh you were supposed to die
[2:13:50] <%Monkeyweed21> THIS HURTS YOU SHEPHARD
[2:13:52] <%Blackleafx> Shepard Groans
[2:13:52] <%hax_metatron> We Bloodborne now
[2:13:52] <%machshop> lookin like Janosz in Ghostbuster 2
[2:13:52] <%Solid_Stro> Assuming Control!!!
[2:13:53] <%ainzhelm> No achievement for you
[2:13:53] <+destro_223> Harby Eyes
[2:13:55] <Vantesla> @alzero83 Oh definitely petty given the option to shoot or reject Star Child choices to a bad end wasn't originally in the game at launch. not from my recollection.
[2:13:55] <%Varlinator> kill these fuckers
[2:13:56] <cerberusgate2117> Too bad they could not implement a prison break sequence ala Dragon Age Origins.
[2:13:56] <%watts121> Shepards cyborg powers!
[2:13:57] <%coward_man> I advise switching that geth shotgun, cause... boy
[2:13:57] <DSD24> Eww cerberus clothes
[2:13:57] <dekkitout> WE MEET AGAIN, SHEPARD
[2:14:00] <mr_saturday93> You can win it
[2:14:01] <+Alig200> @GustauveVIII yeah, its not an achievement in the LE, since they condensed all of the DLC achievement lists down.
[2:14:03] <%cvp5127> LUL
[2:14:04] <ExpressNode> They didn't fucking tie him down?
[2:14:05] <%Blackleafx> SHEPARD PAUNCH!!
[2:14:06] <$realm_forge> PREPARE HIM FOR PROBING
[2:14:06] <Madinki> How did we KNOW Pat would not survive long enough
[2:14:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> those guards fucking suck
[2:14:08] <tanarath> But the reaper ISN'T
[2:14:09] <Teras_ode> I AM A WOMAN NOW SHEPARD
[2:14:09] <CrimsonGargoyle> SSSMOKIN SEXY STYLE
[2:14:11] <itss_coco> what dlc is this?
[2:14:12] <%MrATheGreat> PUNCH THEIR CLOCKS
[2:14:13] <%Romuken> bang now
[2:14:14] <%JoshManVGH> Built a better shepard they did!
[2:14:14] <+AmericanSkidd> why'd they put you back in cerberus clothes?
[2:14:15] <5pencer1001> whew, this shepards got hands
[2:14:15] <dekkitout> Go Die Hard on these jobbers
[2:14:16] <%maenos2> shepard PAWNCh
[2:14:17] <%amaranthos> we're gonna defeat this anti human scum
[2:14:18] <%Mr_Pylon> that sucks that you can't win that
[2:14:19] <GuyverTypeL> ROBO SHEP GOGOGO
[2:14:20] <KeystoneA2> Punch that guy wearing a full face helemt
[2:14:23] <sirrice77> why are the guards and their guns just gone?
[2:14:23] <peachy996> Quick find some ketchup
[2:14:23] <ape_hawk> put... put your dick in the barrier
[2:14:25] <MidnightPacif1c> scientist is scuffed femshep
[2:14:30] <%Blackleafx> ASSUME CONTROL
[2:14:30] <jorniev> IS IT JUST ME OR SHEPPARD HA SOME REALLY MEAN HOOKS
[2:14:30] <DSD24> @itss_coco The Arrival DLC
[2:14:33] <%count_bob> @Alzero83 Indoctrination theory was debunked because no other indoctrination works that way in any of the other games.
[2:14:33] <Alzero83> Didnt they change the ending to ME3 cause they were petty people figured it out thru the indoctrination thoery @PatStaresAt
[2:14:34] <Madinki> YOU CAN NOT BEAT ME I AM WOMAN NOW SHEPARD
[2:14:35] <mr_saturday93> it's more win to lose but yeah
[2:14:36] <holyxgrale> They should've had a moment where you walk through the barrier with sheer willpower
[2:14:39] <%andrewofbob> Did that just say "assume control?
[2:14:39] <cerberusgate2117> @Vantesla Indeed. The EC made rejecting the Crucible into a bad end
[2:14:40] <dd44dostivei> assuming direct control
[2:14:46] <%watts121> look at ur shep!
[2:14:48] <itss_coco> @DSD24 ahh ok ty ty
[2:14:51] <%hax_metatron> This is sick
[2:14:55] <%Blackleafx> @Alzero83 No? IT was about Dark Energy
[2:14:58] <+tinytinykittycat> being these robots sucks
[2:14:58] <peachy996> this part was neat at least
[2:14:59] <Pillagius> OK, wth? Who would leave a prisoner next to a terminal?..
[2:15:01] <%amaranthos> The Mass Effect Movie starring Alex Jones as commander Shepard
[2:15:06] <+flexin_apex> Excuse me
[2:15:14] <%hax_metatron> They should have had assume control of robots mode in the main game too like this
[2:15:15] <dawarw0lf> @count_bob I will say my favorite part of it was “oily shadows” as it seems super right
[2:15:17] <%teefpal> @Vantesla still one of the best endings
[2:15:20] <CrimsonGargoyle> FUCKIN GOTTEM
[2:15:22] <cerberusgate2117> Robo remote is pretty neat indeed.
[2:15:26] <yourliteraldog> Sploosh
[2:15:29] <+destro_223> Let’s go
[2:15:30] <%amaranthos> these nuts hurt you, Shepard
[2:15:31] <ExpressNode> Project Nut Combustion
[2:15:36] <peachy996> Wait out the clock
[2:15:37] <+AmericanSkidd> you were out for 2 days
[2:15:40] <5pencer1001> dont let him knock over these dominoes we set up and didnt take down for some reason
[2:15:42] <jorniev> 2 HOURS
[2:15:42] <KeystoneA2> That is a real timer
[2:15:42] <%robosqueeb> thats a good klaxon
[2:15:45] <GuyverTypeL> his stuff right there huh?
[2:15:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats a real clock btw
[2:15:49] <%count_bob> Parts of it are interesting.
[2:15:51] <%marusux> Got em
[2:15:51] <SiameseSneeze> I've got to massacre the Batarians and get the hell outta here
[2:15:52] <%Blackleafx> man these indoctrinated scientists are really dumb
[2:15:52] <+tinytinykittycat> countdown is real
[2:15:53] <awfully_crispy> Don't have much time, better talk to myself in front of a clock
[2:15:53] <dawarw0lf> Fun fact: if you actually wait you get a unique game over
[2:15:56] <cerberusgate2117> I just realised how weird is it to see Mark Meer's voice come out of Pat's model LUL
[2:15:58] <GuyverTypeL> !uptime
[2:15:58] <@Moobot> @GuyverTypeL I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 16m.
[2:15:59] <+flexin_apex> Wrex
[2:16:01] <%hax_metatron> He had The Rock eyebrow there for a second
[2:16:02] <dd44dostivei> turn on warp ammo
[2:16:03] <%Ziegsy> I went for a poop, whys shepherd been captured?
[2:16:05] <jorniev> WHY DID SHEPPARD GO SOLO AGAIN?
[2:16:12] <CrimsonGargoyle> Shepard and his GUN
[2:16:15] <%machshop> the royal we
[2:16:16] <%Blackleafx> Me :)
[2:16:16] <Pillagius> I've been meaning to ask: Why Pat's character looks more like Zangief, BTW?
[2:16:17] <+destro_223> Let’s massacre this whole station
[2:16:17] <%Varlinator> preverbial we
[2:16:18] <DSD24> "I've been spotted"
[2:16:18] <%robosqueeb> me :)
[2:16:18] <+D00msDayDan> we've been spotted, zach
[2:16:18] <%coward_man> no but for real if she's indoctrinated why did she bring shepherd here?
[2:16:20] <holyxgrale> Me myself and I
[2:16:22] <%watts121> Shepard considers his guns squadmates
[2:16:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @jorniev Hackett asked him to
[2:16:26] <%andrewofbob> Shepherd is talking to his gun
[2:16:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why wouldn't they just sabotage the control systems
[2:16:28] <Vantesla> Shepard talks in the third person SeemsGood LUL
[2:16:28] <+FelIian> the Royal We
[2:16:30] <CrimsonGargoyle> ^
[2:16:32] <+Bigbossman91> @jorniev it's Shepard not Sheppard
[2:16:32] <M0untain_wolf> This is when the Doom music kicks in
[2:16:34] <+Shady_Zaku> the royal we
[2:16:34] <%Jmann1892> Its the Royal We
[2:16:39] <Doomstar16> Oh hell yeah
[2:16:39] <%hrbeck_> Whomstve
[2:16:41] <dawarw0lf> Only 2hr and16 mins for both of the dlc. Shadow broker was longer than that by itself
[2:16:43] <DSD24> So Shepards now killing a bunch of Alliance personal
[2:16:44] <CrimsonGargoyle> You're tearing me appart Shepard!
[2:16:47] <%andrewofbob> Does the Geth shotgun have geth programs inside?
[2:16:47] <Teras_ode> Good call shepard. Thanks Shepard
[2:16:48] <%Solid_Stro> Shepard looks behind him, doesn’t see his squad, and cries
[2:16:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @coward_man to indoctrinate him with the artifact
[2:16:58] <%hax_metatron> I love when games have voiceovers with the enemies freaking out about your strength. Hitman does this amazingly in the Berlin level
[2:17:03] <cerberusgate2117> I think Shep is solo here for development convenience. They only need Meer, Hale and Lance Hendrikson as major VAs here
[2:17:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> You've torn up one Quarian asshole.
[2:17:06] <+destro_223> Shepard is tearing us a new one
[2:17:07] <+flexin_apex> He’s gonna say it again
[2:17:12] <dekkitout> Quite a few
[2:17:22] <Vantesla> @dawarw0lf Shadow Broker was the gold standard for ME2 DLC.
[2:17:25] <SiameseSneeze> You can't stop me from committing Batarian Genocide!
[2:17:36] <Madinki> "Guys.......HE'S JUST ONE GUY!"
[2:17:46] <+Ghufufin> use your SPECIAL BULLETS Pat
[2:17:53] <CrimsonGargoyle> who hits harder, shepard or shepard's shotgun
[2:17:57] <5pencer1001> all they had to do was put handcuffs on him
[2:17:58] <%Monkeyweed21> warp ammo @PatStaresAt
[2:18:05] <GuyverTypeL> The hami wami ammo
[2:18:07] <cerberusgate2117> He's a man, not a god. Come on, comrades!
[2:18:09] <%goose_attack_almanac> They didn't even put restraints on Shepard
[2:18:09] <%hrbeck_> Tearer of qussy
[2:18:10] <5pencer1001> boom, universe dead
[2:18:12] <+destro_223> We MUST kill the Batarians at all costs
[2:18:16] <+flexin_apex> Geth shotty is so good
[2:18:20] <%Blackleafx> INSTAGIBBED
[2:18:21] <cerberusgate2117> Oof
[2:18:23] <%watts121> Flamethrowers worked, we got him!
[2:18:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 420 blazed it
[2:18:26] <holyxgrale> The most busted enemies
[2:18:28] <dawarw0lf> This and the fight you can survive are the only things I like about the dlc
[2:18:29] <%Blackleafx> toasted sheperd
[2:18:31] <$realm_forge> Now you can one shot them harder
[2:18:31] <+Shady_Zaku> REKT
[2:18:34] <%UvBenServed> CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[2:18:36] <Vantesla> Pat forgets his ammo all the time LUL If playing on Hardcore or Insanity he wouldn't forget SeemsGood
[2:18:41] <+destro_223> Stun lock
[2:18:43] <%hax_metatron> LUL We got him!
[2:18:46] <%xcompleasedad> Schooled
[2:18:47] <xbb1024> Shepard used is ultimate ability, the reload
[2:18:54] <%Blackleafx> CRISPY
[2:18:54] <Aiutare47> The stagger on flamers is brutal
[2:18:55] <%machshop> you are allowed to use cover
[2:18:56] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[2:19:01] <+Shady_Zaku> PAT USE COVER
[2:19:01] <SiameseSneeze> fire bad
[2:19:04] <RayCSmooth> Toasty
[2:19:04] <%JamesCorck> Don't it!? lol
[2:19:06] <CrimsonGargoyle> shepard on fire dances better than regular shepard LUL
[2:19:07] <peachy996> It sure does suck being alone with no squadmates huh?
[2:19:09] <%Monkeyweed21> FIRE BAD
[2:19:10] <cerberusgate2117> Flame abilities causing stagger is annoying asf
[2:19:10] <%andrewofbob> GALACTIC COMBO
[2:19:10] <Alzero83> LUL
[2:19:12] <mak0t0yukii> Cover exist pat Kappa
[2:19:12] <holyxgrale> MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HEADBUT THE FLAMETHROWER
[2:19:13] <Mattais88> This room fucked me a few times too
[2:19:14] <%Varlinator> Normal difficulty BTW
[2:19:15] <%JamesCorck> The stun-lock in this game is out of this world.
[2:19:15] <dawarw0lf> I like Shepard going it solo and how it’s an actual hard part I like
[2:19:15] <%Romuken> big stun lock that time
[2:19:17] <Dunmarkh> @machshop no he's not, this is a vamguard playthorugh
[2:19:17] <+akscully> lol
[2:19:17] <Vantesla> Do this on Insanity was definitely not fun even if I like most of it....
[2:19:17] <+destro_223> BBQ Shepuuuuurd
[2:19:19] <+AmericanSkidd> Layered CC, my one weakness
[2:19:19] <%hax_metatron> Can’t believe that worked — again! High five!
[2:19:19] <dd44dostivei> avoid the bullets
[2:19:19] <GuyverTypeL> fire bad, cover good
[2:19:19] <%BlackStarAura> Stop fucking the flames lol
[2:19:21] <%walternatorz> who knew a game built around the cover system sometimes relies on cover
[2:19:22] <%ArchimerCXV> this aint your grandpa's dlc
[2:19:22] <Madinki> Remember Patrick cover IS a thing that is real
[2:19:23] <$realm_forge> FIRE INDEED HOT
[2:19:29] <tattleworm> turn it down another difficulty level and become the true baby
[2:19:33] <%xcompleasedad> USE THE HEAL
[2:19:37] <+destro_223> Insanity here is tough
[2:19:46] <GuyverTypeL> "We've managed to avoid drowning!"
[2:19:51] <+flexin_apex> On insanity this area nuts
[2:19:53] <dawarw0lf> @madinki Vanguard don’t no what that word means
[2:19:54] <yourliteraldog> He only knows two things Unga and Bunga
[2:19:59] <Teras_ode> Is easy mode selectable now?
[2:20:07] <Dunmarkh> Pat shouldn't have picked the shotgun that actually requires him to aim.
[2:20:09] <dawarw0lf> Vanguard charge. He no use cover
[2:20:12] <%Blackleafx> my god hes learned how to use cover
[2:20:16] <Vantesla> Geth Shotgun is anti self cover due to the charge pushing Shep out all the time LUL
[2:20:25] <cerberusgate2117> For some reason, ARs in Insanity translate to rapid fire hitscans
[2:20:34] <cerberusgate2117> For enemies that is

[2:21:43] <+Alig200> lets be real, warning them wouldn't do much with only an hour and 42 minutes left.
[2:21:43] <williamrooster> warn seems like the cruel choice
[2:21:43] <holyxgrale> They should have let you get a choice and then let you get a bad ending
[2:21:43] <dawarw0lf> (But not actually a choice)
[2:21:44] <%Torus1025> LET THEM BURN

[2:22:41] <yourliteraldog> Epic Gamer Moment
[2:22:42] <williamrooster> GOTTA BLAST!
[2:22:43] <%embranz> Not warning the Batarians is Paragon
[2:22:43] <%teefpal> FULL WAR CRIME
[2:22:44] <ExpressNode> Spacism
[2:22:45] <xbb1024> you don't get their fleet later
[2:22:45] <%CatastropheCorvid> I love how his eyes are dead while he's thinking about it, like Shep just DOES NOT care.
[2:22:46] <%Ranryu692> wait did Pat not call the Batarians?
[2:22:47] <%ainzhelm> Think of all the 4 eyed children
[2:22:48] <SovPho> that didn't make sense
[2:22:50] <%hrbeck_> Why is Pat a supermutant?
[2:22:51] <dekkitout> Paragon!
[2:22:52] <%Reaviar> its only a war crime if you get caught
[2:22:53] <%walternatorz> does she realize she didn't have to send that message and pat would have left?
[2:22:53] <$realm_forge> +100 paragon
[2:22:53] <+cermo55> you may have ruined a side quest in 3
[2:22:54] <%Rumbutt> I mean they're all indoctrinated reaper bait so like who cares
[2:22:54] <%machshop> only 2 lmao
[2:22:54] <Meta_Outhorii> Only 2?!
[2:22:56] <jorniev> PARAGON OF HATING BATARIANS
[2:22:57] <Dunmarkh> 2?
[2:22:59] <+D00msDayDan> that should have taken away renegade points
[2:23:00] <%teefpal> LUL
[2:23:00] <ape_hawk> 2 RENEGADE FOR MASS GENOCIDE
[2:23:00] <Coystick> A lil renegade
[2:23:01] <dekkitout> TWO?!?!
[2:23:01] <homestylewaffles> Just a little renegade
[2:23:02] <+bubblebasspickles> +2
[2:23:04] <Dunmarkh> LUL LUL
[2:23:04] <+AmericanSkidd> The batarians get to die in blissful ignorance
[2:23:04] <%robosqueeb> lmao 2renegade
[2:23:04] <%RetroCop87> WHOLE COLONY DEAD. 2 RENEGADE.
[2:23:06] <GustauveVIII> GET INDOCTRINATED, DONT DISMANTLE ROCKETS, I GUESS BEING MIND CONTROLLED MAKES YOU FUCKING DUMB
[2:23:06] <CrimsonGargoyle> lmao batarians aren't worth the renegade points they're printed on LUL
[2:23:06] <chancho4tierra> 300k 2 renegade
[2:23:07] <KeystoneA2> 300,000 = 2
[2:23:08] <dekkitout> R u 5 rea?!
[2:23:08] <%JoshManVGH> "No, you will all die the way I want you to die!"
[2:23:08] <%DashXero> Apparently, genocide is only worth 2 renegade points... strangeShrug
[2:23:10] <%chance_h> just a minor warcrime, no biggie
[2:23:12] <RayCSmooth> small price to pay Kappa
[2:23:12] <GuyverTypeL> Now the galaxy is a much much safer place
[2:23:12] <%machshop> that's what Batarians are worth
[2:23:12] <SaltyAzteca> THIS GAME HATES BATARIANS
[2:23:14] <Madinki> BRING DOWN THE BATARIAN SKYS
[2:23:14] <%zeitgeist134> It's just some batarians
[2:23:15] <%cvp5127> even the game agrees LUL
[2:23:15] <%Mr_Pylon> fewer Renegade points than shaking down a dude on the Citadel
[2:23:16] <%hax_metatron> KOTOR could never LUL
[2:23:17] <Mattais88> Planets of Batarians worth less than punching a reporter
[2:23:18] <peachy996> Yeah of all the points to dump points at you, that's laughable
[2:23:18] <Teras_ode> Everyone on this rock is going to die anyway LUL
[2:23:19] <cerberusgate2117> 2 Renegade points for star system genocide LUL LUL LUL
[2:23:21] <%AzureGale> That should be Renegade +1 million
[2:23:23] <+tinytinykittycat> 150,00th of a point per batarian
[2:23:23] <%HairballCT> @homestylewaffles as a treat
[2:23:24] <$SGrim> ONE FOR EACH BATARIAN WHO MATTERS
[2:23:24] <5pencer1001> the real renegade action is to fart into the mic
[2:23:25] <+Shady_Zaku> 1 point for every 150k dead
[2:23:27] <%robosqueeb> you can have a little bit of renegade as a treat
[2:23:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @GustauveVIII it explicitly does
[2:23:30] <%Blackleafx> SHES INDOCTRINATED
[2:23:30] <tanarath> 2 renegade, as a treat
[2:23:31] <%Solid_Stro> It’s Batarians, it’s not that evil Kappa
[2:23:33] <williamrooster> thats the same as being kind of a dick in convos
[2:23:34] <SiameseSneeze> You should be getting PARAGON
[2:23:40] <Vantesla> Pat Ash would have warned. You are in essence worse than Ashley confirmed LUL
[2:23:40] <peachy996> It wouldn't have mattered Kenson interrupts the warning.
[2:23:41] <%hax_metatron> DARK SIDE THEME PLAYS
[2:23:41] <tanarath> THEY WILL, PAT
[2:23:43] <Blank9> 149,999 dead batarians is still a mulligan, morally
[2:23:46] <dekkitout> Could've atleast tweeted the Batarians
[2:23:47] <holyxgrale> Gotem
[2:23:49] <+destro_223> Indoctrinated fool
[2:23:51] <GuyverTypeL> I can live with it
[2:23:53] <+Alig200> even the game realizes that warning them would've done very little, even if it was the thought that counted.
[2:23:57] <+Ploobie> music sounding like jenova
[2:23:58] <+toastybites> bitch cray cray
[2:23:58] <falyden> that music
[2:24:04] <cerberusgate2117> I guess the low Renegade points is because the victims are Batarians.
[2:24:05] <+destro_223> Reaper tech is bad mkay?
[2:24:07] <%rkbinder> Use the Cain, last chance
[2:24:08] <dawarw0lf> I do like the music in this dlc even if it doesn’t stand out as much as the others
[2:24:10] <%hax_metatron> SHE DID THE FLORENCE PUGH FACE
[2:24:11] <+unhuggable1> is the best theory
[2:24:12] <%CatastropheCorvid> @dekkitout TikTok'ed em.
[2:24:12] <%StaceMcGate> "How could you get mind controlled? What are you stupid?"
[2:24:15] <%walternatorz> I totally loved the indoctrination theory
[2:24:16] <%Rumbutt> indoctrination theory was super cool
[2:24:16] <+RenoDeGeneric> +2 Paragon, you trying to save her just cancelled out your genocide
[2:24:17] <%ainzhelm> “At least let them die clueless” - Patrick B 2021
[2:24:18] <peachy996> Yup
[2:24:18] <%Blackleafx> Fucking ZAPPED
[2:24:19] <%Varlinator> They really should've worn tin foil hats
[2:24:22] <ape_hawk> yeah, its effective
[2:24:22] <%machshop> Shepard's mind-dick is too big
[2:24:22] <PinkSocks> the theory is super valid
[2:24:23] <+akscully> yep yep yep
[2:24:23] <+Peacefrog7> hahahaha
[2:24:23] <Vantesla> You are by Reapers a lot in ME3
[2:24:25] <spongeofmystery> Real shame you can't impale her on the artifact thing and let her bleed out on top of it
[2:24:26] <%BlackStarAura> SUCH a blessing to get turned into Reaper GOO
[2:24:27] <Blank9> shepard gets reaper teched at least 3 times
[2:24:28] <%coward_man> almost like Indoctrination theory was super plausible!
[2:24:29] <%amaranthos> an
[2:24:32] <%Blackleafx> Sheperds soaking it up like a sponge
[2:24:33] <tattleworm> there's so much proof for it
[2:24:34] <%Wurmspawn> Too bad the writers shot it down hard.
[2:24:34] <%dooscent> WE GOT ANOTHER ONE LADS
[2:24:34] <+AmericanSkidd> I still like parts of the indoctrination theory
[2:24:34] <dawarw0lf> But you can skip this dlc
[2:24:35] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU WENT INSIDE A REAPER
[2:24:36] <Tracazoid> The Derelict Reaper
[2:24:36] <AluxStreams> Indoctrination Theory is super solid and interesting, just doesn't gel extremely well with the story they wanted to tell.
[2:24:37] <dawarw0lf> So mo
[2:24:38] <%count_bob> It's still not enough.
[2:24:39] <tanarath> You DO
[2:24:39] <cerberusgate2117> Not according to Bioware NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:24:39] <SaltyAzteca> plot aemor
[2:24:40] <%Jmann1892> Shepard balls are too big to be indoctrinated
[2:24:40] <TheMostAverageGamer4> yeah and keep a husk head in me3
[2:24:41] <Blank9> you are reapered AND synthetic as hell
[2:24:43] <stantheman_97> it would have been good and bioware should have ran with it
[2:24:43] <%chance_h> You get hit buy PROTHEAN tech, not reaper
[2:24:46] <+Ploobie> JENOVA ripoff music
[2:24:47] <%Solid_Stro> @blank9 It’s an oopsey doodle
[2:24:48] <peachy996> How many reaper artifacts have you made contact with? You were even inside a dead reaper
[2:24:49] <knight_verse> Shepard is resistant to indoctrination.
[2:24:55] <%coward_man> your own cybernetics are based on reaper tech!
[2:24:58] <dekkitout> Even if him being Lazarus'd might've wiped it, he's gotta be compromised now
[2:25:01] <Blank9> shepard's head is too empty to even have an existential crisis about being a robot
[2:25:03] <+unhuggable1> i have headcannoned indoctrination theory
[2:25:05] <Alzero83> No, Petty Bioware changed it cause we figured it out @PatStaresAt
[2:25:05] <peachy996> And yet you and your squad are the only ones unaffected
[2:25:06] <jorniev> I GUESS non indoctrinated people did not fight it hard ennough
[2:25:06] <+DatAsuna> there's no good reason why you're immune, your dick is just that big
[2:25:12] <tanarath> @chance_h Arrival's artifact is reaper tech
[2:25:13] <5pencer1001> notice how they completely forgot that shepard has special alien knowledge in his brain from ME1 that makes him special?
[2:25:13] <jorniev> I HATE THAT
[2:25:17] <%Varlinator> man, giving the geth shotgun a 5 round clip really was overkill
[2:25:18] <%Maids4lyfe> Shepard's nightmares in 3 even directly have the same visuals that the Rachni queen described indoctrination was like
[2:25:26] <%Wurmspawn> Shepard's innabiliyt to be indoctrinated is like Star Team's Zombie immunity in RE.
[2:25:28] <%ahomeschooldropout> The last 15 minutes of ME3 is so ridiculously nonsensical that the only explanation is that you got indoctrinated. otherwise there's a billion plot holes
[2:25:30] <%Solid_Stro> Only the small penises get indoctrinated
[2:25:30] <dawarw0lf> If he did get it here then Shepard is weak as HELL then
[2:25:32] <%teefpal> @Blank9 brain smooth as his head
[2:25:33] <knight_verse> @coward_man That's a fucking lie.
[2:25:35] <Mattais88> Too much pothean beacon in his head for anything else
[2:25:36] <%amaranthos> This indoctrinates you, Shepard
[2:25:41] <%count_bob> Except indoctrination doesn't trick you. It makes you serve the reapers directly.
[2:25:41] <%Ranryu692> @5pencer1001 it comes up a few times in 3
[2:25:42] <Blank9> seriously shepard just thinks he came back from the dead, no robots or cloning involved
[2:25:43] <%count_bob> Not fight them.
[2:25:48] <%AzureGale> Yeaaaaaaah insert that rod nyannBlush
[2:25:49] <cerberusgate2117> I always found it weird that Shepard and crew have never been indoctrinated despite all their time in contact with Reapers and their artifacts.
[2:25:50] <%Enz0ned> Even Bioware said that it was a great theory
[2:25:57] <$realm_forge> Lore wise I think it’s explained away with Shepard having an unbreakable will
[2:25:57] <tattleworm> i appreciate that she doesn't think her men can kill you, she just wants to slow you down
[2:26:00] <tanarath> @patstaresat indoctrination is subtle, remember
[2:26:04] <peachy996> Except Saren uses the same Prothean Beacons and he is very clearly indoctrinated
[2:26:09] <CrimsonGargoyle> catJAM music
[2:26:12] <%JoshManVGH> Or the prothiean beacons provided some sort of protection on accident. They weren't designed to interface with human brains well
[2:26:14] <%coward_man> @knight_verse all tech in Mass Effect is based on Reaper Tech, they left it on purpose to push society in certain ways
[2:26:19] <%count_bob> @cerberusgate2117 IF you think about it, it's not even really, a full day in with reaper stuff.
[2:26:24] <5pencer1001> it was all a dream is not a great ending to a series and only stands to contrast how awful the actual ending was
[2:26:24] <Vantesla> @ahomeschooldropout Like Anderson always being ahead or how though he was originally by you outside he was nowhere to be seen, but came up after you...
[2:26:30] <Goatllama> good ol reapers
[2:26:31] <%amaranthos> I'm commander Shepard and this is my favorite genocide on the station
[2:26:35] <+unhuggable1> the more indoctrinated you are the weaker you become
[2:26:42] <dekkitout> @realm_forge That sounds trite. I'd be more willing to accept an acute concussion made him immune
[2:26:44] <knight_verse> @coward_man That's not hot it works. NotLikeThis
[2:26:48] <+DatAsuna> @coward_man which is why the darkenergy idea would have been even stupider, because they force us to use dark energy
[2:26:52] <%ainzhelm> Indoctrination is all fun and games until you get vlad the impaled on a husk spike
[2:26:53] <knight_verse> *how
[2:27:00] <dawarw0lf> It happens over months not days. Shepard was only here for days
[2:27:06] <GuyverTypeL> Shepard's absolute giga chad influence prevents his team for getting indoctrinated
[2:27:07] <Alzero83> He was asleep for 3 days with that RHo reaper artifact Nuking his body as he slept @PatStaresAt
[2:27:09] <Blank9> shepard was never smart
[2:27:12] <%Blackleafx> Shepard can have a little indoctrination as a treat
[2:27:12] <$realm_forge> @dekkitout lol that would be great
[2:27:13] <%Ranryu692> indoctrination is slow unless you get Dragon Tooth'd
[2:27:17] <%count_bob> @dawarw0lf Exactly
[2:27:17] <%Varlinator> Indoctrinated from the waist up only
[2:27:20] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat I know reapers who use subtext and they're all cowards
[2:27:20] <%Jmann1892> Indoctrination says no Qussy and that's why it doesn't work on Shepard
[2:27:22] <%walternatorz> time to kill Williams
[2:27:22] <%CatastropheCorvid> He can have a little indoctrination. As a treat.
[2:27:23] <Mattais88> Yeah, but remember after he said that you conviced him so hard that he was wrong, that he killed himself
[2:27:23] <+Dova573> Are you being indoctrinated right now pat?
[2:27:23] <heartlesshealer> smrt
[2:27:24] <%JoshManVGH> A skosh, a taste of indoctrination
[2:27:26] <xbb1024> Shepard is just the next Serin
[2:27:27] <peachy996> Williams?!! Die Williams!
[2:27:27] <Blank9> shepard is like fry in futurama
[2:27:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Friends don't let friends end up on a husk spike
[2:27:28] <jorniev> LIKE its only for making it aesier to fuck them over later
[2:27:28] <%Varlinator> waist down I meant
[2:27:33] <%hrbeck_> Shepard just needs to sling dick/hussy
[2:27:35] <cerberusgate2117> @cerberusgate2117 In terms of contact, Shep and crew have small doses in frequent doses.
[2:27:35] <williamrooster> Indoctrination could have been a cool element of the series but it just became an excuse for twist villians
[2:27:37] <%Monkeyweed21> oh shit its Ashley's cousin
[2:27:40] <knight_verse> You get indoctrinated if you have long term exposure to Reaper artifacts, as in months.
[2:27:40] <5pencer1001> or just say the cypher from the protheans allows him to avoid indoctrination
[2:27:43] <dekkitout> Flukes are always more satisfying than asspull brute force
[2:27:47] <ExpressNode> Just the tip of indicktranation
[2:27:52] <%bread_assassin> ABAB
[2:27:53] <holyxgrale> Shepard is a spectre and because of that he is immune to all influence
[2:27:55] <SiameseSneeze> YEAAAH
[2:27:57] <GuyverTypeL> Aren't we all indoctrinated to watch pat tho? ashiekConcern
[2:27:59] <%Solid_Stro> The Qussy prevents indoctrination
[2:27:59] <+Wolfstriker121> OH NO
[2:28:01] <%tuesti> LUL
[2:28:02] <peachy996> awwww no
[2:28:04] <OldManDeckardCain> "We'll bang, ok?" - Shepard to the reapers (allegedly)
[2:28:04] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[2:28:05] <%Rumbutt> AWW YEAH
[2:28:07] <alwayspronking> ohno!
[2:28:07] <dawarw0lf> You have to remember this dlc is OPTIONAL. You can skip being near the artifact
[2:28:08] <zhenthrim213> AHHHH YEAH
[2:28:08] <+Jake_from_State_Farm> Batistas in this game??
[2:28:11] <xbb1024> so smrt
[2:28:16] <+Wolfstriker121> AHHH YEAH
[2:28:18] <%robosqueeb> IM A GENIUS! OH NO
[2:28:19] <+D00msDayDan> @holyxgrale that's right, no spectre would never succumb to outside influence
[2:28:20] <%Ranryu692> @GuyverTypeL not indoctrinated, just lonely
[2:28:20] <+destro_223> shepard has never been exposed to reaper tech for long periods of time. so no indoctrination
[2:28:22] <jorniev> THE ONLY CURE FOR INDOCTRINATION IS THAT ALIEN PUSS
[2:28:22] <%BlackStarAura> Mmm cover
[2:28:24] <heartlesshealer> smrt decision
[2:28:27] <HyperionXV> raysL
[2:28:27] <tanarath> I AM A GENIUS
[2:28:27] <Vantesla> Harbinger: The indoctrination theory is true Shepard...
[2:28:33] <%JoshManVGH> The reason Shepard can't be indoctrinated is simple: Reapers wanna kill Wrex, and Shepard ain't having that!
[2:28:38] <+Shady_Zaku> QUSSY is the secret ancient cure to indoctrination lmfaooo
[2:28:42] <peachy996> But when it's optional and you can skip Arrival it sort of breaks the intro to ME3
[2:28:43] <$realm_forge> The reapers saw the size of shepard’s monster dong and we’re intimidated. Thus he is immune to their brain bullshit
[2:28:47] <Alzero83> How do you explain shepard absorbing that Reaper Juice energy for days while he slept leading up to this point @PatStaresAt
[2:28:47] <%Lion_kun> how much dlc is left?
[2:28:51] <%Monkeyweed21> your purple onahole isnt here to cover you Sheparc
[2:28:54] <%machshop> AAAAAAAAAAoof
[2:28:57] <Vantesla> Harbinger: I'm in your head Shepard. This hurts you.
[2:28:58] <cerberusgate2117> @knight_verse I always wondered if indoctrination works cumulatively. Like you can spend small amounts of time with an artifact but it can build up if too much brief time is spent near it regularly...
[2:29:01] <+Wolfstriker121> I STILL ALIVE IN YOUR HEAD SHEPARD
[2:29:03] <%Romuken> is special ammo active?
[2:29:09] <%Rumbutt> I like how they scream when you pull them
[2:29:10] <williamrooster> @Lion_kun tis is the last one
[2:29:18] <%Romuken> nvm i see it
[2:29:18] <+destro_223> Lord Garrus is the true MC. Shepard is the sidekick
[2:29:18] <%Solareon_> i dont remember them yelling that much when you biotic them
[2:29:25] <%robosqueeb> I love to pull on it and beat it too
[2:29:28] <cerberusgate2117> He saved the meteor!
[2:29:35] <GustauveVIII> wait until ME3 where combat goes off the goddamn rails
[2:29:41] <%count_bob> He saved the genocide!
[2:29:43] <zhenthrim213> ok
[2:29:47] <%machshop> reapers love telling shepard "you didn't win"
[2:29:51] <dawarw0lf> You know chat, you woke up and chose violence today.
[2:29:54] <%Romuken> You see Kenson, I have this nuke on my back.
[2:29:54] <+Shady_Zaku> Lol bet
[2:29:57] <%andrewofbob> Kenson has hit the stupid level
[2:30:02] <cerberusgate2117> @GustauveVIII ME3's combat is pretty dope at parts
[2:30:04] <Blank9> I wish ME3's vanguard melee was in vanquish
[2:30:05] <+Wolfstriker121> OH NO
[2:30:08] <CrimsonGargoyle> EZ
[2:30:09] <jorniev> JUST DROP HER

[2:30:15] <%JoshManVGH> She... wants to be indoctrinated?
[2:30:17] <peachy996> good job
[2:30:19] <%Solid_Stro> shotoPew shotoPew shotoPew
[2:30:19] <cerberusgate2117> @andrewofbob Indoctrination does that canonically tho
[2:30:19] <holyxgrale> WORTH IT
[2:30:19] <ExpressNode> Didn't even hesitate
[2:30:20] <%robosqueeb> whoops
[2:30:20] <%Dakuu75> dead man switch, nice
[2:30:21] <tanarath> KILL HER
[2:30:22] <+DatAsuna> your choices matter
[2:30:22] <jorniev> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:30:22] <Teras_ode> LUL
[2:30:25] <peachy996> choice? matter? lool
[2:30:25] <knight_verse> @cerberusgate2117 Nope, it has to be long term exposure, anything less won't work. Remember that it's a gradual process, the moment you start to hear boices you are gone.
[2:30:26] <+destro_223> chunks of flaming meat
[2:30:28] <SaltyAzteca> SHE STARTS MONOLOGUING
[2:30:30] <heartlesshealer> death grip
[2:30:32] <+Shady_Zaku> CHOICES
[2:30:35] <+redthebaron> oh so shepard just succeds
[2:30:39] <%ssjklyco> This seems more animated than most of ME 2
[2:30:41] <%robuttastic> why did that look like that bad spiderman quick action
[2:30:50] <+cermo55> it might affect a side quest in 3
[2:30:52] <holyxgrale> YOU COULD HAVE SOYED HER UP
[2:30:54] <xbb1024> as in matters for ME3?
[2:30:56] <GuyverTypeL> We only stop the monologue
[2:31:00] <%walternatorz> welp, time to die and get rebuilt again
[2:31:04] <peachy996> Now's a great time to run out the clock
[2:31:09] <peachy996> For a neat cutscene
[2:31:10] <karl_rex> Its like tempering before the cure. Got to kill them once they've been indoctrinated
[2:31:11] <jorniev> @GuyverTypeL WORTH IT
[2:31:12] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> This is like a doomsday timeline.
[2:31:12] <%JoshManVGH> How the hell would the Normandy get away from this shit?
[2:31:12] <+Wolfstriker121> OH SHIT ITS RESIDENT EVIL escape time!!
[2:31:16] <+AmericanSkidd> 30 minutes till the big surprise party
[2:31:18] <Vantesla> Hackett might be a tad salty you didn't try saving his indoctrinated friend LUL
[2:31:19] <%BlackStarAura> 30 minutes left
[2:31:26] <peachy996> Eh
[2:31:27] <DSD24> Its weird having Shepard talking to himself
[2:31:28] <CrimsonGargoyle> i forgot what overlord is LUL
[2:31:31] <cerberusgate2117> @knight_verse That makes sense. Or else the Reapers would be too OP.
[2:31:32] <%teefpal> Arrival is shorter
[2:31:32] <%JamesCorck> Wait for the ME3 DLC's.
[2:31:33] <GustauveVIII> pat enjoyed the vanguard punch
[2:31:33] <+ScrapKingKeita> Shadow Broker taught us that Legion was a pro gamer, therefore it was the best
[2:31:34] <CrimsonGargoyle> what was it
[2:31:38] <knight_verse> @cerberusgate2117 Remember the cerberus scientists on the derelict Reaper, they got indoctrinated because they basically lived there, just like the people in this dlc and the. there's the Batarians.
[2:31:38] <peachy996> You only like it bc you get to kill a bunch of Batarians
[2:31:40] <%Lion_kun> Overlord is a great anime.
[2:31:41] <%JamesCorck> The best parts of ME3 are in the DLCs.
[2:31:42] <%Rumbutt> Shadow Broker is better than most of the full games in the series tbh
[2:31:43] <stantheman_97> doesn't seem hard
[2:31:45] <%count_bob> Did Pat punch that guy in overlord?
[2:31:45] <+tinytinykittycat> I miss squad chatter
[2:31:47] <+Wolfstriker121> 30 MINS TILL DETENATION PLEASE REPORT TO THE TRAIN for departure
[2:31:47] <%walternatorz> help them escape this mortal coil
[2:31:48] <%JamesCorck> They're all great.
[2:31:51] <dawarw0lf> I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH LE. THEY RUINED THIS FIGHT COMING UPz
[2:31:52] <tanarath> It is much better, yeah
[2:31:57] <TourettesPlays> "This should come in handy" there is literally no content left Shepard
[2:32:01] <%Solid_Stro> Legion is a toxic gamer, best revelation
[2:32:02] <%JoshManVGH> I think that computer was the same VA as Kasumi
[2:32:07] <%count_bob> Good.
[2:32:11] <CrimsonGargoyle> YEAH !
[2:32:16] <+Wolfstriker121> HOLY SHIT this looks better
[2:32:16] <jorniev> I HATE leviathan though
[2:32:23] <dawarw0lf> THEY RUNIED THIS FIGHT. ITS MEANT TO BE QUIET
[2:32:24] <Madinki> Shepard talking without us telling him what to say is WEIRD. And it happens A LOT in ME3
[2:32:25] <+flexin_apex> I like this shot of the relay
[2:32:25] <jorniev> such a lame story
[2:32:26] <knight_verse> @cerberusgate2117 Exactly, remember, there's no Leviathan of Dis in Ba Sing Se.
[2:32:27] <%Varlinator> That health upgrade is hilarious considering this is the very last mission you do
[2:32:32] <+AmericanSkidd> oh look, the WRESTLEMANIA sighn
[2:32:42] <%andrewofbob> DLC ranking: Citadel > Shadow Broker > Arrival > Omega > everything else
[2:32:44] <%Ranryu692> @Varlinator you can do it earlier
[2:32:50] <Vantesla> One thing the remaster should had done. is career all upgrades in NG+... But no they couldn't do that for some reason....
[2:32:52] <heartlesshealer> yeah it's a good look at the relaly
[2:32:59] <cerberusgate2117> I always liked the visuals here. The incoming Mass Relay is really awesome.
[2:33:02] <KeystoneA2> Cain time
[2:33:04] <+Wolfstriker121> PAT POINT AT THE wrestlemaina sign i mean the relay LOL

[2:33:22] <peachy996> But the lore is sketchy

[2:35:05] <peachy996> No Squadmates
[2:35:06] <+kewlmyc> "all of a sudden"
[2:35:07] <%Archmortal> translation: this part does not let me stand out in the open eating bullets for 2 minutes
[2:35:08] <Vantesla> Harbinger: You didn't win Shepard. Harbinger: This is but a pyrrhic victory Shepard. Harbinger: Do you know your history Shepard?
[2:35:09] <%Ranryu692> @Varlinator Hackett telling you to turn yourself in when you're done running around with Cerberus is hilarious. I'm not advocating for doing it earlier, I was just pointing out that you can, hence the upgrade
[2:35:10] <knight_verse> Pat, I beat this part easily as a Soldier on Insanity, you're on Normal...
[2:35:11] <zhenthrim213> that guy was STANDING ON ANOTHER GUY
[2:35:12] <%JamesCorck> It's foine.
[2:35:13] <%Varlinator> What do you mean "All of a sudden"? LUL
[2:35:16] <%Maids4lyfe> maybe also heal yourself?
[2:35:16] <+Shady_Zaku> Use cover more dingus
[2:35:17] <peachy996> All of the enemies are focused on you
[2:35:18] <%count_bob> Only now?
[2:35:20] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Hubris, Pat. Hubris.
[2:35:22] <%Monkeyweed21> your purple Onahole isnt here to cover your ass
[2:35:26] <Aiutare47> There is a difficulty spike in dlc
[2:35:26] <5pencer1001> because you missed all the upgrades pat
[2:35:35] <%JamesCorck> It's the ending of ME2 Pat, after this there's only greatness a ahaha haha ha haha haa hahaha ;C
[2:35:37] <+AmericanSkidd> I wonder who escapes on that shuttle?
[2:35:38] <+DatAsuna> @knight_verse soldiers are also stupidly overpowered in ME2, or rather adrenaline rush is
[2:35:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> HE DID IT
[2:35:51] <CrimsonGargoyle> GOOD JOB
[2:35:52] <cerberusgate2117> I think you can charge and move at the same time
[2:35:54] <zhenthrim213> good trade

[2:36:35] <%RaziWraith> Just in case you were paragon in the previous choice....here is the part that REALLY matters LUL
[2:36:37] <+redthebaron> SHEPARD
[2:36:37] <Teras_ode> yo
[2:36:38] <knight_verse> @cerberusgate2117 @datasuna That's the best part. Kappa

[2:36:49] <%Ranryu692> what holographic projector is on this landing pad?
[2:36:55] <%ainzhelm> If you didn’t destroy the collector base then the collector general will instead show up
[2:36:55] <%walternatorz> it wasn't sacrificed. this was a victory in itself
[2:36:56] <+critikal_bit> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[2:36:59] <GuyverTypeL> SOVEREIGN IS COOLER THAN YOUUU
[2:36:59] <%robuttastic> harbinger kinda looking like a flea than a squid there imo

[2:37:06] <+redthebaron> SHEPARD COME ON STOP IT BA-A-KA
[2:37:06] <%hax_metatron> DIO SAMA IS NOT PLEASED
[2:37:07] <cerberusgate2117> If you did this before the Suicide Mission, the hologram is the Collector General. Just a neat little detail.
[2:37:11] <5pencer1001> remember how the best part of sovereign was that he didnt give a shit about you
[2:37:20] <+cermo55> and aliens
[2:37:20] <$realm_forge> ANIME WAS A MISTAKE SHEPARD
[2:37:25] <cerberusgate2117> Harbinger: Nu'uh. You didn't win!
[2:37:25] <5pencer1001> remeber how nonthreatening this guy is
[2:37:25] <+Alig200> @ainzhelm doesn't the general only show up if you do it before the suicide mission?
[2:37:27] <DSD24> For the DLC
[2:37:27] <%robuttastic> HE SAID IT
[2:37:29] <dawarw0lf> Roll credits
[2:37:29] <%machshop> HE SAID THE THING
[2:37:29] <Ids560> hey they said the title
[2:37:30] <Vantesla> Harbinger: Sovereign was the Wimp Lo of us Shepard.
[2:37:30] <%rkbinder> And then the ME3 ending happened
[2:37:31] <ape_hawk> harbinger is less cool and threatening than sovereign
[2:37:31] <peachy996> Man Harbinger your speeches suck compared to Sovereign
[2:37:32] <%Varlinator> Ah Ah he said the thing!
[2:37:32] <Dunmarkh> roll credits
[2:37:33] <+Alig200> man, i love this music.

[2:37:48] <%Archmortal> Alliance Military: what if we don't prepare at all though
[2:37:49] <%BlackStarAura> BUG BITCH
[2:37:50] <williamrooster> I will murder many more batarians to stop you
[2:37:51] <+kortin> The fact that reapers look like some sort of undersea creature just makes me hate the ocean more
[2:37:52] <%machshop> LUL
[2:37:52] <falyden> asses will be fucked, Shepard
[2:37:52] <+destro_223> Genocide TIME

[2:38:01] <%coward_man> tiem for BIG rock
[2:38:01] <%ainzhelm> @alig200 That’s what I mean. Sorry but 99% of people blow it up anyway
[2:38:01] <%Solid_Stro> Harbinger; You Didn’t Win
[2:38:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Who cares its Batarians
[2:38:05] <%machshop> why did he run up to tell him that lol
[2:38:05] <%Mr_Pylon> We humans will fight you, we will sacrifice every Batarian to stop you!
[2:38:06] <%teefpal> No VA
[2:38:08] <jorniev> not really
[2:38:08] <%hax_metatron> Time for Shepard to go to court
[2:38:10] <%JamesCorck> Yeah, the trouble will be to find place on your chest for all the medals they're gonna give you.
[2:38:11] <+AmericanSkidd> rock wins
[2:38:12] <yourliteraldog> Hey it works
[2:38:13] <%StaceMcGate> BUT DON'T SAY ANYTHING JOKER, that costs Seth Green money
[2:38:15] <%chance_h> Just a prank bro
[2:38:17] <%morningmoondude> a VERY big rock
[2:38:17] <%JoshManVGH> No seth green for DLC?
[2:38:17] <%JamesCorck> For killing all those evil Batarians.
[2:38:17] <Blank9> you are going to get a stern talking to
[2:38:20] <%machshop> "oops"
[2:38:23] <GamerWorlock> Seig zeon
[2:38:28] <shevan123> what is this audio
[2:38:28] <Vantesla> We saved the System! Also the Batarian race! SeemsGood
[2:38:28] <%ainzhelm> SETH GREEN WHY ARENT YOU BEING PAID TO SAY LINES
[2:38:30] <asylumkon> it's so funny that joker doesnt get any lines because they couldnt get seth green for the dlc
[2:38:30] <peachy996> Ashley would be proud
[2:38:33] <BurdRightsActivist> OOPS LUL
[2:38:36] <tanarath> Might have looked better if you warned the batarians, Pat.
[2:38:36] <Ids560> wow it's crazy that this is what happens when you blow up a mass relay
[2:38:37] <%RetroCop87> DAMN
[2:38:37] <+Alig200> @ainzhelm no worries lol, i wasn't 100% sure myself since ive never not blown it up too lmao.
[2:38:39] <peachy996> You did Ash proud Pat.

[2:38:45] <+Wolfstriker121> its fine its fineeeee they are just sleeping
[2:38:46] <SaltyAzteca> Ashley is smiling at us
[2:38:46] <%machshop> 300K DEAD BATARIANS
[2:38:47] <%Wurmspawn> Take the Killer Crok approach to killing Batman. "I THREW A ROCK AT HIM! Well, it was a big rock...."
[2:38:47] <%morningmoondude> SHEPARD OF MURDER
[2:38:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Brutal
[2:38:48] <dekkitout> Ya know- this reminds me of Jay and Bob talking about the Death Star
[2:38:52] <%JoshManVGH> That shit is gonna be FLYING
[2:38:53] <+gmackwreck> Hackett gonna be like "The fuck Happened?!!"
[2:38:53] <DSD24> That's a good shot
[2:38:53] <%tuesti> god damn
[2:38:54] <knight_verse> Pat is from Zeon confirmed.
[2:38:54] <%hax_metatron> It’s kind of insane how evil this is LUL Just dooming an entire race
[2:38:55] <5pencer1001> time to honor their sacrifice by doing nothing to prepare in the time we saved
[2:38:56] <%ssjklyco> That had a MASS EFFECT on things
[2:38:57] <yourliteraldog> EPIC GAMER MEME
[2:38:57] <cerberusgate2117> So, this is the reason why ME3 showing the relays blowing up is universally regarded as a bad thing LUL LUL LUL
[2:38:58] <ThatGuyThere03> And nothing of value was lost
[2:38:58] <mr_saturday93> WHORE CRIMES

[2:40:03] <%coward_man> OOPS
[2:40:04] <Madinki> OOPS ALL DEAD BATARIANS
[2:40:05] <+destro_223> They were just Batarians hackett...chill

[2:40:12] <williamrooster> what was i supposed to do not kill batarians
[2:40:12] <+Shady_Zaku> 300000 BATARIANS DEAD, REAPER IS A FUCK
[2:40:13] <RushUnplugged> just Shepard things
[2:40:13] <%dooscent> look there are a lot of rocks in space
[2:40:14] <%machshop> this guy acting like he didn't know Shepard would fuck shit up
[2:40:14] <%Varlinator> You goin' to JAIL Shepard!
[2:40:15] <blackjack8182> Oopsie
[2:40:16] <%Wallabri> hiiiii lance henriksen!
[2:40:20] <+AmericanSkidd> We were about 5 minutes away from a bad surprise party sir
[2:40:21] <xbb1024> Just blame Kensen for everything
[2:40:22] <+D00msDayDan> i thought he was gonna shake hackett's hand lmao
[2:40:24] <hat_under_bread> But it was full of Batarians so it's okay.
[2:40:28] <$realm_forge> I JUST DECIMATED TOMATO TOWN ADMIRAL
[2:40:33] <cerberusgate2117> Nothing of value was lost, Admiral. I should be knighted! LUL PogChamp
[2:40:35] <mr_saturday93> I rescued the fuck outta Dubai I mean, the colony sir
[2:40:36] <+gregpivo> Come on, Admiral. They were Batarians. It's not like they had souls.
[2:40:37] <%machshop> IS
[2:40:38] <+redthebaron> like hackett absolutelly set you up for this
[2:40:42] <%Ranryu692> I like that although he's mad, Hackett trusts you enough to calmly let you explain yourself
[2:40:42] <knight_verse> Hackett wants to know if you want to prestige Pat.
[2:40:44] <Vantesla> The proof is Shepard drawing of Batarian dying in agony
[2:40:46] <%coward_man> Reapers are in the milky way RIGHT NOW
[2:40:51] <+destro_223> Hacketts knows Shepard stacks bodies wherever he goes
[2:40:52] <%ainzhelm> Well admiral, she couldn’t hack it :3
[2:40:54] <Alzero83> 2 Days Absorbing that Reaper Juju @PatStaresAt
[2:40:58] <ape_hawk> why not? they have less numbers now
[2:41:00] <%andrewofbob> Good thing that will be resolved soon...
[2:41:02] <%DashXero> How many of them could there possibly be now?
[2:41:03] <%morningmoondude> YOU CAN'T GO TO WAR WITH THE BATARIANS WHEN THEY'RE ALL DEAD
[2:41:04] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah but fuck Batarians
[2:41:06] <+cermo55> Reaper will take care of that
[2:41:06] <%Torus1025> You ARE guilty
[2:41:08] <pally_din> how many batarians are even alive at this point though
[2:41:08] <%watts121> Fair...but also fuckem
[2:41:08] <%JoshManVGH> How is there ANY evidence?!
[2:41:09] <%RetroCop87> WORTH IT
[2:41:10] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Batarians can fuck off with their attempt to run an astroid into a human colony
[2:41:10] <%Ipsenscastle> yeah absolutely
[2:41:12] <+redthebaron> yeah they do
[2:41:12] <%tuesti> "worth" LMAO
[2:41:12] <TourettesPlays> The Reapers are seen as an insane conspiracy theory by most of the galaxy so Shepard appears to be a literal terrorist
[2:41:14] <%JamesCorck> Eh they're dead, who cares for them.
[2:41:15] <%machshop> it's fine, guess who the Reapers hit first lmao
[2:41:17] <+Wolfstriker121> IT WAS WORTH IT...I DID IT FOR MY KIL STREAK DAWG!
[2:41:19] <%Varlinator> LIES
[2:41:20] <SiameseSneeze> I'd do it again... a million times over
[2:41:20] <peachy996> basically almost genocided a race
[2:41:20] <KeystoneA2> Oh that problem will take care of itself soon enough...
[2:41:20] <Vantesla> LUL
[2:41:21] <%Ranryu692> you just took out one of their systems LUL
[2:41:23] <%JamesCorck> They're slavers and evil, fuck them.
[2:41:23] <RayCSmooth> They're always mad anyway Kappa
[2:41:23] <GuyverTypeL> Is it worth killing the batarians for 2 days of prep time?
[2:41:24] <sirrice77> Should've just been a planet of Vorcha, no one would care then
[2:41:24] <+akscully> "if I could have sent a message, I would have"
[2:41:24] <SiameseSneeze> are you sure about that
[2:41:25] <AluxStreams> You did to them what they tried to do with Asteroid X47, but worse.
[2:41:28] <yourliteraldog> Yeah shepherd did a big warcrime
[2:41:28] <%Solid_Stro> They be a little pouty
[2:41:30] <%chance_h> But so do mosquitoes but their opinion doesn't matter
[2:41:30] <+destro_223> Batarian leadership is already indoctrinated
[2:41:30] <tanarath> Yes
[2:41:31] <mr_saturday93> A medal for killing billions
[2:41:32] <Teras_ode> "Worth it" LUL
[2:41:32] <ARDM112> Batarians can't actually fight the Alliance, they couldn't 15 years ago they sure as hell can't now
[2:41:33] <cerberusgate2117> Oh, this line does change if you tried to warn the colony
[2:41:34] <$SGrim> METAL FOR GENOCIDE
[2:41:36] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Hackett's eyes don't fit his fucking face
[2:41:37] <SiameseSneeze> Batarian Massacre medal!
[2:41:37] <5pencer1001> the realest renegade action would be to let 1 or 2 reapers show up to make everyone prepare for them
[2:41:38] <GamerWorlock> your cool hacket
[2:41:39] <tanarath> AND YOU DIDN'T WARN THEM
[2:41:42] <dekkitout> When ONE GUY is responsible for a 300,000 K/D, it'd be best you throw him under a bus
[2:41:42] <%hax_metatron> They’re kind of uggo anyway right Hackett?
[2:41:43] <cerberusgate2117> ME3 set up
[2:41:43] <+AmericanSkidd> The Hegemony is Indoctrinated btw
[2:41:44] <knight_verse> Sure they do... lol.
[2:41:45] <%amaranthos> Shepard did 9/11 x 150
[2:41:49] <peachy996> But Why earth? Why not the Citadel
[2:41:52] <Vantesla> Pat Shepard is saving a Batarian equal genocide.
[2:41:54] <TheAntiNihilist> oopsies a race war
[2:41:56] <peachy996> This is not an Earth issue
[2:42:01] <ARDM112> @AluxStreams X57 was gonna kill 4 million people, this only killed 300 thousand. Fuck batarians.
[2:42:08] <mr_saturday93> @amaranthos super 9/11
[2:42:09] <cerberusgate2117> Watch as Cerberus does a complete 180 in ME3
[2:42:10] <%Varlinator> GTA Shepard
[2:42:17] <%Solid_Stro> I Stole It sabert14Comfy
[2:42:19] <yourliteraldog> Dude you might have started a race war
[2:42:21] <+destro_223> @ARDM112 Right
[2:42:25] <%machshop> oh yeah i bet the batarian military is something alright...
[2:42:27] <+Wolfstriker121> SHEPARD did it for the kill streak...300k dead from a SPACE AIR STRIKE
[2:42:28] <spongeofmystery> Quit Cerberus and stole their best ship and operatives, maximum chad moves
[2:42:34] <peachy996> I hate this dlc. the story is fast and loose
[2:42:34] <Flame_Water> fuck those dumb as batarians
[2:42:40] <mr_saturday93> The race war starts nooooooowww!
[2:42:42] <%Ranryu692> don't worry, the Batarians won't need much aid
[2:42:52] <blackjack8182> Cereberus is about to become Cobra
[2:42:56] <+cermo55> I hope in MASS EFFECT 4 the Batarians do a complete 180 and become pacifist that want to be your friend and give you free upgrades.
[2:43:01] <%Solid_Stro> There are little TRILLIONS of Reapers
[2:43:03] <%Varlinator> What about my dress Black&Red
[2:43:04] <peachy996> and it only shows what ME3 will be like in the future
[2:43:04] <ThatGuyThere03> NO READ IT THOUGH
[2:43:08] <+AmericanSkidd> Sir I have to finish colonizing Tali's ass
[2:43:10] <cerberusgate2117> @peachy996 My opinion of this DLC has soured over the years tbh
[2:43:10] <+destro_223> Batarians damn there go extinct in ME3
[2:43:11] <%JoshManVGH> Hell of a thing to stay neutral when lovecraftian mechanoids attack from the skys.
[2:43:12] <+DatAsuna> you do need to see the report though hacket
[2:43:13] <spongeofmystery> MASSIVE LEGAL VIOLATION
[2:43:13] <%amaranthos> killing batarians is always the right thing
[2:43:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That's a fucking loaded statement
[2:43:16] <Alzero83> Tali better be in ME4
[2:43:18] <5pencer1001> pat should play the first level of 3 with no arrival import, it makes no fucking sense lol
[2:43:19] <%Ipsenscastle> 'I don't need to see the report on how you killed 300K civilians'
[2:43:20] <%StaceMcGate> great job at your war crimes
[2:43:26] <%Varlinator> And that's the end of Mass Effect 2! Woooooo!
[2:43:26] <%Ranryu692> "also I want no evidence that I"m the one who sent you on this mission"
[2:43:26] <+Dova573> Does this happen even if you dint do the dlc?
[2:43:26] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @cermo55 I hope they're all dead because fuck em
[2:43:28] <Ids560> go away TIM
[2:43:29] <%RaziWraith> Not reading it is kinda irresponsible though
[2:43:30] <ExpressNode> So do the bartarians actually retaliate or do they just do nothing?
[2:43:31] <+Wolfstriker121> 300k vs 1 mill reapers...yeah i would let the 300k die
[2:43:32] <peachy996> hoooray
[2:43:34] <$realm_forge> Shepard has to bang tali at least 1 more time before the trial
[2:43:34] <metalsiren31> "It's okay shepard, I don't need to see this evidence incriminating me as an accomplice so you keep that"
[2:43:35] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat reset your points before you import so you can freely Respec when you start 3
[2:43:36] <DSD24> ME 3 time!
[2:43:37] <wibbwobbler> The Batarian issue was a bit overblown
[2:43:39] <peachy996> Check the galaxy map
[2:43:39] <SaltyAzteca> -2 renegade btw
[2:43:39] <%Solid_Stro> Batarians get even more fucked in ME3, it’s insane c4sageLUL
[2:43:39] <%AzureGale> TO BE CONTINUED... IN MASS EFFECT 3
[2:43:40] <Vantesla> either way Commander I don't die. Hackett out.
[2:43:42] <%ElkRiverDog> Ok real talk: does warning the colony change anything?
[2:43:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @Alzero83 ME4 might be like 500 years later or some shit Liara would be the only one still alive
[2:43:46] <peachy996> That place is gone
[2:43:46] <hat_under_bread> @Ipsenscastle They were Batarians. Of course he doesn't.
[2:43:47] <%Mr_Pylon> so without Arrival does the opening of 3 make any sense?
[2:43:48] <Alzero83> Now ME3 Begins!
[2:43:52] <KeystoneA2> @ExpressNode They were going to, but then they got ass reamed by the Reapers right out of the gate
[2:43:53] <%count_bob> @peachy996 It's okay. Still better then firewalker.
[2:43:54] <%teefpal> There's a lot of side content in ME3 for such a rushed game
[2:43:55] <%Puhff> CoolGuy Hackett
[2:43:57] <Madinki> @ElkRiverDog nope
[2:43:58] <peachy996> No warning the colony changes nothing
[2:43:59] <%StaceMcGate> I wonder if the Batarians have even killed 200,000 humans
[2:43:59] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat reset your points before you import so you can freely Respec when you start 3!
[2:44:00] <+OneGorillionDollars> Great job killin' 300,000 Batarians Bruddah!
[2:44:01] <%Vyskus> is it sad that I literally JUST realized that illusive is a pun on elusive and illusion
[2:44:02] <%coward_man> @Mr_Pylon no
[2:44:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @Alzero83 Grunt might still be alive tho
[2:44:03] <%JoshManVGH> Shepard Joined the War Crime Club. Mordin has his new hoodie
[2:44:04] <cerberusgate2117> @NopeBadguy Does this work in vanilla 2 and 3?
[2:44:07] <%machshop> you did it
[2:44:07] <williamrooster> Just clog all the relays with dead batarians that'll slow the reapers down
[2:44:07] <+AmericanSkidd> you did it
[2:44:09] <%chance_h> Batarians get stomped on by the reapers because they don't like teamwork
[2:44:10] <peachy996> Yeah Firewalker sucks
[2:44:11] <knight_verse> @elkriverdog no
[2:44:12] <AmuserName> ME2: BEATEN
[2:44:14] <%AzureGale> Wait he didn't say "Shepard-Commander"
[2:44:15] <+cermo55> @cermo55 the reapers already did that in 3
[2:44:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Yep
[2:44:16] <mak0t0yukii> Is it ME 3 time
[2:44:17] <DSD24> @Mr_Pylon They are vague about what Shepard does
[2:44:17] <Virokwet> no
[2:44:17] <$realm_forge> YO LEGION FUCK THOSE BATARIANS AMIRITE?
[2:44:18] <+Ches_Neckbeard> didn't kill enough Batarians
[2:44:20] <+Shady_Zaku> I had no idea why the opening of ME3 was what it was, but NOW I get it
[2:44:20] <Ardailec> @Mr_Pylon the event still happens, they just catch you up on it at the start.
[2:44:21] <+Peacefrog7> yes
[2:44:22] <%hax_metatron> Batarians are the Cricket guy in It’s Always Sunny basically
[2:44:22] <%JamesCorck> Well done Pat.

[2:44:31] <+SilverDevilfish> "Not biggest warcriminal on Normandy now. *Deep breath*. Not as good of a feeling as you would think." - Mordin
[2:44:31] <+redthebaron> batarians got owned
[2:44:32] <%Archmortal> it is in fact a thing
[2:44:33] <%JamesCorck> Is it ME3 now?
[2:44:34] <%Solid_Stro> Maybe
[2:44:35] <%Varlinator> Nothing to do now but head to Omega 1 last time & do the Shepard shuffle dance
[2:44:36] <%JamesCorck> And yeah it does.
[2:44:37] <peachy996> Check the map and admire your handiwork
[2:44:37] <%Mr_Pylon> thanks guys, and lol
[2:44:39] <RushUnplugged> you can respec in 3 too

[2:44:55] <Vantesla> it spec what it thinks it should be. It doesn't translate one to one
[2:44:55] <%count_bob> Your exact build yes.
[2:44:57] <TourettesPlays> powers different in 3
[2:44:59] <%Ranryu692> well they just raise the level cap to 60 in 3 and give new skills
[2:44:59] <+DatAsuna> ME3 will have a different build
[2:45:00] <%dooscent> ME3 has cooler skills
[2:45:00] <wolfen091> firewalker has no impact period
[2:45:01] <+tinytinykittycat> you can respec in 3 too
[2:45:01] <%andrewofbob> ME3 skills go up to 6
[2:45:01] <+Qexec> There will be new abilities
[2:45:02] <AmuserName> NEW GOOD SKILLS.
[2:45:02] <Alzero83> @Monkeyweed21 I dont know why you would think its 500 years later, nothing indicates that and the only evidence in the trailers is the shadowy reaper corpse in the background
[2:45:03] <+Peacefrog7> just keep it
[2:45:03] <ARDM112> Skills don't work the same way in 3
[2:45:03] <%idyota> me3 levels go up to 6
[2:45:04] <%bread_assassin> You get new skills in ME3.
[2:45:04] <+Bigbossman91> @RushUnplugged not until after you've been to the Citadel
[2:45:04] <%hax_metatron> God I can’t wait for Citadel DLC
[2:45:04] <%ainzhelm> Go ask joker why he didn’t say anything earlier m
[2:45:05] <Mattais88> And then some for the stunted levels of 20-30
[2:45:07] <%Supernova15_> it respeced already for me
[2:45:07] <%AzureGale> Well don't worry about it then
[2:45:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It doesn't actually translate
[2:45:10] <+destro_223> incendiary ammo is gold in ME 3
[2:45:12] <%count_bob> New skills better.
[2:45:12] <tattleworm> in me3, incendiary ammo can be specced to proc explosions on each shotgun pellet, you want that @PatStaresAt
[2:45:12] <%HeadAsianInCharge> new op skills in ME 3
[2:45:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you get the other half of your kit in 3
[2:45:15] <cerberusgate2117> Powers in ME3 do change up quite a bit indeed
[2:45:18] <+DatAsuna> Also several powers not in this game
[2:45:19] <tanarath> IT CHANGES
[2:45:20] <%Dakuu75> stats probably mean differnt things in 3

[2:45:24] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat there are new skills in 3

[2:45:25] <%Varlinator> at rank 4 they split off between 2
[2:45:30] <Vantesla> Also changes make certain thing worse or better.
[2:45:34] <tanarath> BIG combat overhaul again
[2:45:35] <Alzero83> Fire Walker is dumb Item BS, no story relevance
[2:45:39] <cerberusgate2117> Nova + Charge will be good friends in ME3
[2:45:42] <+Alig200> literally chose Engineer for the entire trilogy for that one class interrupt in the omega dlc lmao.
[2:45:49] <+Peacefrog7> ME3 when pat?
[2:45:49] <%Ranryu692> RIP Shitstorm
[2:45:52] <yourliteraldog> POKEMON
[2:45:54] <cerberusgate2117> Firewalker sucks tbh
[2:45:55] <mattynezz> Nova+Charge is stupid busted
[2:46:00] <knight_verse> ME3 skills are infinitely better.

[2:46:42] <cerberusgate2117> @Varlinator To be fair, it is a very boring 10 minutes.
[2:46:43] <%ElkRiverDog> coxHypers

[2:47:01] <peachy996> the highlight of Firewalker is going to another Prothean world
[2:47:04] <peachy996> but thats it

[2:47:09] <ammobasket> oh man I hope you like it
[2:47:13] <+Alig200> @Vantesla It was surprisingly fun, since I had never tried Engineer before, especially on insanity lol.
[2:47:13] <rekinom> Pat is CURSED with good taste
[2:47:15] <%StaceMcGate> Pat played it before it was popular, now he misses out on the bandwagon
[2:47:18] <ExpressNode> I tried playing it but it wasn't for me
[2:47:20] <%AzureGale> Is that teh one that has the award-winning Heavensward expansion for free
[2:47:21] <stantheman_97> wow pat jumping on the bandwagon now?
