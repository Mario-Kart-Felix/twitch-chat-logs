[0:13:09] <+Mrbaconator> no i can not
[0:13:10] <jorniev> ye
[0:13:11] <naoi0> @SolSwagGuy56 Not sure if you're mistaken or not but he's going to sleep in game, not ending the stream or so
[0:13:12] <%Ranryu692> dammit, why does Twitch never tell me when you restart streams
[0:13:13] <j___a___c___k___> why theres racists in the chat ?
[0:13:13] <PartyFavors> faintly, yes
[0:13:17] <%walternatorz> I thought that was construction
[0:13:19] <%king_wragles> I'm hoping it's the cable at least, seems like the easiest thing to fix
[0:13:22] <+JobbedBone> we don't even hear him anymore :)
[0:13:28] <Brandon__Brando> did you get a new tv because of a bad hdmi cable?
[0:13:29] <CosmoSire> Is there an actual time limit in the game?
[0:13:30] <%baka_sugoi> i like this song
[0:13:38] <teefpal> Chill
[0:13:41] <+JobbedBone> we are conditioned to gief
[0:13:43] <%Blackleafx> I like how Garte never sleeps
[0:13:49] <Lodestarrobot> is anyone having issues with the stream that it repeats? or is it just my twitch?
[0:13:51] <AtticusofBronne> Sup chat how do

[0:13:59] <SolSwagGuy56> is that right? 10 days?
[0:14:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Brandon__Brando At this point it seems likely
[0:14:00] <Garry_Guyface> not a time limit time limit but an action limit
[0:14:02] <jorniev> you had to do something 3 days ago in the game
[0:14:02] <CatRidder> 5

[0:25:17] <%Mendin> Save Immediately
[0:25:26] <+JobbedBone> its really sad and causes a lot of problems
[0:25:27] <Brandon__Brando> not to get to real but love how accurate the volition with those thoughts
[0:25:32] <%juxtest> Kim excited to get back in the game
[0:25:36] <SolSwagGuy56> Loud n Nasty boyz

[0:25:51] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Pat something's wtrong, your cursor is broken, be concerned
[0:25:52] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yeah, save before you talk to the Hardies.
[0:26:02] <aiutare47> Pat actually missed a really good line of Volition dialogue by not asking what Speed is
[0:26:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Based on everything I've played and seen in Pat's stream I have a theory as to the killer
[0:26:05] <Vyskus> Kim's accent is sexy as fuck
[0:26:06] <%GarbageNirvana> One I'm not gonna share of course
[0:26:06] <naoi0> This is a pretty mediocre hotel
[0:26:09] <huskarl_zap> Become ungovernable
[0:26:10] <yeeyeyee> @KaiserMario it fixes itself over time
[0:26:14] <cheapdoc> hardie boys huh
[0:26:15] <PartyFavors> It's the *local militia* baby
[0:26:16] <dinnydanny777> Like the books? LUL
[0:26:19] <yeeyeyee> @KaiserMario it's a known bug, just graphical no gameplay impact
[0:26:20] <+Jiggisnipe> Matt and Jeff PogChamp
[0:26:21] <thelonechris> They've got raging clues
[0:26:23] <huskarl_zap> BAH GAWD TWIST OF FATE
[0:26:26] <+PkSilent01> So did we ever found our Gun and Badge?
[0:26:28] <%juxtest> But I am the law!
[0:26:41] <%Blackleafx> @PkSilent01 Nope
[0:26:47] <kikoeru_san> make sure to finish up with the body before talking to the boys
[0:26:52] <yourliteraldog> Go yell at the blackshirts
[0:26:54] <jorniev> recomend it

[0:26:58] <yeeyeyee> Yes
[0:26:59] <jorniev> nah man
[0:26:59] <+bugz_munny> nah
[0:27:00] <Visorak6> Not necessarily
[0:27:00] <aiutare47> not everyday
[0:27:00] <%Blackleafx> Nope!
[0:27:01] <@commanderclaw> They increase but not reduce IIRC
[0:27:02] <yeeyeyee> Kind of
[0:27:03] <aiutare47> some days
[0:27:03] <KaiserMario> @yeeyeyee A friend of mine got locked out of some sidequests because of bugs, I'm always worried things might break
[0:27:04] <%Alazull> Not entirely
[0:27:04] <laserbeaming> some change
[0:27:04] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[0:27:04] <Blank9> not really
[0:27:04] <walaladun> no
[0:27:05] <AvroEltz> Yes they do
[0:27:06] <+Bouerd> Not really
[0:27:07] <%torusendor> Nope
[0:27:07] <naoi0> @PatStaresAt Not every day but like very slight utside
[0:27:07] <cardamomo88> NOT
[0:27:07] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> Not realllly
[0:27:07] <%Blackleafx> It doesn't
[0:27:08] <jorniev> no
[0:27:08] <faithless_zealot> Not EVERY single day, I don't think
[0:27:08] <Vyskus> I don't think so?
[0:27:08] <%RyanGelatin> not quite
[0:27:08] <theWarwitch> some do go away
[0:27:09] <+JobbedBone> A little not much
[0:27:09] <%Blackleafx> A few dissappear
[0:27:10] <bettysharkface> Not really
[0:27:11] <+chiazam> Not everyday
[0:27:12] <user_naim> new one appear
[0:27:12] <+systemic66> there are some changes everyday
[0:27:13] <Lancaster_H> sometimes, specific ones
[0:27:13] <+pectusumbra> Body body body
[0:27:13] <Garry_Guyface> it's fiiiine
[0:27:15] <%RyanGelatin> most ppl stay in the same places
[0:27:15] <kikoeru_san> people get added
[0:27:15] <sirtommygunn> small changes with the minor npcs
[0:27:16] <%thelaxinator> There is some variation
[0:27:16] <jorniev> they just ADD UP
[0:27:17] <%Alazull> Small changes every day but not a lot
[0:27:17] <%bread_assassin> There's some new ones added each day.
[0:27:19] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> almost everyday
[0:27:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> French Japanese guy huh
[0:27:21] <hippofant> @commanderclaw There is definitely some reduction, on occasion.
[0:27:22] <Blank9> most everyone is in place until you talk to them
[0:27:25] <Garry_Guyface> grabby hand
[0:27:26] <+bugz_munny> sometimes new people show up
[0:27:27] <PartyFavors> New ones show up but the old ones don't usually go away without prior notice
[0:27:27] <%dalmek> I mean some disappear because they sleep, so you might not see them until the next day
[0:27:32] <Mucmaster> It changes slightly as time goes on but most people can be found in the same place everyday
[0:27:33] <aiutare47> dude its fine

[0:27:50] <Lancaster_H> you can fix the cursor thing by hovering over an item and not hovering in inventory @PatStaresAt
[0:27:50] <%Mendin> The cursor thing is a known bug for Disco Elysium

[0:27:57] <yeeyeyee> @PatStaresAt the cursor will fix itself over time, it seems to randomly hit lines of code that will reset it back to normal. It won't affect gameplay

[1:23:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> 2
[1:23:48] <+rottingpastry> Good moral
[1:23:52] <huskarl_zap> power armor cool is the moral
[1:23:54] <popcultureaficionado> always choose the oddest option
[1:24:00] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:24:05] <%The48thCrow> @naoi0 True, I think that's just to be fair in their humor. But I think ultimately the writing leans to leftist themes, and that's hard to get into without spoilers
[1:24:06] <PartyFavors> [Kim liked that.]
[1:24:09] <%dalmek> I love the idea of saying "there's a moral to this story... I'll write N/A" and not elaborating at all
[1:24:12] <%linSP> people die when they are killed
[1:24:18] <DianaTheAscian> oh god

[1:24:57] <reonome> @aiutare47 nope
[1:24:59] <naoi0> @aiutare47 I'd say the great parts of the game is in how pretty much every playthrough will be unique to a degree

[1:40:28] <zerointelligence000> Is the narrator a character or is our protagonist crazy?
[1:40:29] <Press_X_ToJASON> @athuramn yeah, and yet, most of us are sane enough not to send him spoilers or complain at him LUL
[1:40:31] <aiutare47> yeah I think chat is getting a bit too hype with the great rolls
[1:40:32] <+athuramn> I like that kim's getting more into this

[1:40:46] <+mczarklesby> @T_Sasquatch Chev Chelios, I have installed a liver into your body that will end you if you don't spoil a movie and/or game every ten minutes.
[1:40:47] <cardamomo88> THIS FEELS HORNY
[1:40:51] <%Blackleafx> @linSP gotta admit, the more i think about it, the more worried i get for Woolie's playthrough
[1:40:52] <%WhereIsWill> gotta get in there Kreygasm
[1:40:53] <%EsotericOdyssey> OH HELL YEAH DID HE FIND IT?
[1:40:56] <%Kataguro> Do it Altera
[1:40:58] <Devbob98> Kinky
[1:40:58] <ingman112> I think pat already knew about it, in fairness. Given that he asked for the motorics boost before seeing the check. But it’s still a good precedent to smash early
[1:41:01] <%linSP> its a PHONE
[1:41:03] <+pectusumbra> Woolie will probably be best treating it like 13 sentinals
[1:41:04] <kanin_usagi> @EsotericOdyssey shush
[1:41:06] <%Xevtes> fucking gross
[1:41:08] <cardamomo88> Kreygasm Kreygasm

[1:41:40] <CursedNobleman> skullfuck it
[1:41:42] <kikoeru_san> YOU GOT THIS
[1:41:42] <SolSwagGuy56> 97%

[1:41:49] <%Kataguro> Oof, low roll too

[1:41:49] <%The48thCrow> just fist this guy's head
[1:41:49] <%linSP> didnt fuck it up!
[1:41:50] <Bootkiller6> wow that was a low roll
[1:41:51] <cardamomo88> nice
[1:41:52] <+rottingpastry> 4 succeeds lol
[1:41:53] <%holydeviant1> Two away from failure, hahaha
[1:41:56] <kanin_usagi> would have been great for a failure, but glad he's getting there
[1:41:58] <SolSwagGuy56> I got it Kreygasm
[1:42:05] <Mucmaster> I know only a snakes eyes would fail but seeing that one still sent me
[1:42:07] <bettysharkface> As high as it was, you always hold your breath.
[1:42:12] <kikoeru_san> LETS GO, GOOD LUCK PAT

[1:42:35] <%linSP> gasp... wow amazing... or it at least it wouldve been....
[1:42:35] <+mczarklesby> Pat's played XCom, you still sweat at %97.
[1:42:39] <AvroEltz> did you know about this from your first time playing @PatStaresAt ?
[1:42:41] <%GarbageNirvana> So I did this out by where the tree was with a low-ass probability on the roll and I felt like a fucking god
[1:42:42] <%Kataguro> Big Breakthrough
[1:42:46] <sirtommygunn> big clue get
[1:42:47] <%WhereIsWill> thats crazy
[1:42:51] <+athuramn> this is like, so far beyond what a cop is supposed to do to a body LOL
[1:42:52] <Devbob98> Oh no, I dropped it on his dick
[1:42:52] <+rottingpastry> is the bullet square tho?
[1:42:57] <aiutare47> really?
[1:43:00] <huskarl_zap> tbh it could be kims but idk
[1:43:02] <Sol_Install> LUL
[1:43:03] <aiutare47> ahhhh
[1:43:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Cuno calls you a fucking necromancer if you do it in front of him
[1:43:04] <kanin_usagi> well at least homeboy didn't ruin it for Pat
[1:43:05] <yeeyeyee> Oh wheew pat wasn't spoiled by chat

[1:43:12] <kikoeru_san> Pat's been playing us
[1:43:14] <@commanderclaw> You must fill chat with fear
[1:43:15] <NeutrinoInteraction> You are the law
[1:43:15] <aiutare47> Pat flexin
[1:43:18] <cardamomo88> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:43:18] <%toastybites> nip it in the bud early
[1:43:19] <%maskedriderhero> now reach into the bullet and find out ITS secrets
[1:43:22] <%Maids4lyfe> I was spoiled though
[1:43:22] <kanin_usagi> I think he might have been shot
[1:43:23] <%NovaKnightmare> So the question becomes: Why the hanging then?
[1:43:27] <Chatterbox1991> So i got this in the yard and not the fridge and the commentary from Cuno and Cunoesse make it way better
[1:43:28] <laserbeaming> it's all about setting the example
[1:43:28] <+Daedalus119> I got spoiled though >:(((
[1:43:32] <Bootkiller6> so what have we learned, chat? shut the fuck up about spoilers
[1:43:33] <+rottingpastry> aw it's not square, lame
[1:43:34] <kanin_usagi> @maskedriderhero its secrets all the way down

[1:45:03] <%Kataguro> Hell yeah you could have.  You can go FAR on incorrect assumptions
[1:45:04] <%Daxalog> Hmmm
[1:45:05] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Yep.  That got me.
[1:45:08] <AvroEltz> Oh yeah, i know i did my first time
[1:45:10] <teefpal> speedrun time
[1:45:11] <%The48thCrow> @penitentpendant be careful with advice like this, let pat fail on his own terms
[1:45:13] <kanin_usagi> you can be chasing the wrong lead for the entire dang game lmao
[1:45:13] <gutterfeast> Cute first date with Kim
[1:45:19] <%AzureGale> Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss.
[1:45:24] <+twohitgood> not likely. if he was hung, the pressure would have caused other issues with the bullet entry and exit.
[1:45:25] <%Blackleafx> Harry is a fuck up, but sometimes, only sometimes, he's a DAMN GOOD COP
[1:45:28] <Djinnazz> coulda been unconcious
[1:45:31] <kikoeru_san> yeah I'm not sure how things go if you miss the bullet
[1:45:31] <%Blackleafx> Detective. Arriving. On scene.
[1:45:46] <T_Sasquatch> I legit just assumed the hanging was a message tbh
[1:45:47] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[1:45:48] <yeeyeyee> @holydeviant1 Yeah it almost feels like an intentional pun
[1:45:48] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:45:52] <echobee_tv> What a bro
[1:45:52] <Teras_ode> LUL
[1:45:55] <BiologicGases> im playing this as a more serious cop so i didnt get the little jingle from kim. im sad i didnt see that :(
[1:45:56] <drysides> @kikoeru_san lol I did on my first playthrough
[1:45:57] <yeeyeyee> by the devs i mean
[1:45:58] <%walternatorz> words.
[1:45:59] <+athuramn> maybe the bullet needs more asses
[1:46:00] <%EsotericOdyssey> @Blackleafx he really is absurdly good at investigation
[1:46:00] <Nohorse> what ARE words
[1:46:00] <echobee_tv> doodLUL
[1:46:02] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[1:46:02] <+athuramn> I dunno, maybe it does
[1:46:05] <%Calenrow> maybe the bullet needs more asses?
[1:46:06] <jorniev> hey waht about the rifle you found in the hole?
[1:46:08] <brachydios777> so far this is like a Sam and Twitch game
[1:46:15] <%hax_metatron> NNOOO
[1:46:15] <Bootkiller6> thanks Hand/Eye Coordination, you weird gun nut
[1:46:16] <%hax_metatron> :(
[1:46:19] <aiutare47> @Blackleafx One of the single things I love about this, Its the Noir trope about the dumpsterfire good cop, except Harry is actually a dumpster fire, yet still a protag you root for
[1:46:21] <+athuramn> maybe it does @Calenrow
[1:46:24] <penitentpendant> @The48thCrow That's more frustration towards the game mechanics than anything else. Most of this stuff you can chain yourself, but the fact that it's TIME GATED was frustrating
[1:46:24] <%Kataguro> I would recommend not doing this
[1:46:25] <AvroEltz> USE DRUGS?
[1:46:27] <Mucmaster> GIVE DRUGS TO THE CHILDREN
[1:46:28] <%hax_metatron> Miss you Kim BibleThump Don't leave me please
[1:46:32] <ingman112> You can always wait til later to send him off too
[1:46:33] <cardamomo88> BibleThump pls go back soon

[2:05:19] <%thelaxinator> Ah nevermind, welcome to revachol...
[2:05:21] <teefpal> God I LOVE Volition so much
[2:05:21] <popcultureaficionado> save the skill points
[2:05:21] <@SSaryn> Usually should save them for checks unless you REALLY want something.
[2:05:21] <laserbeaming> maybe bring perception to max?
[2:05:22] <+egalitarian696969> save for re-rolls
[2:05:22] <AvroEltz> Keep at least 2
[2:05:22] <%holydeviant1> Always leave ONE
[2:05:22] <CursedNobleman> youre already saving them blast it NotLikeThis
[2:05:23] <Nohorse> I usually spend all but 1
[2:05:23] <jorniev> NOT YET
[2:05:23] <Visorak6> YOu didnt spend them when you needed them pat
[2:05:23] <%Mr_Pylon> I always kept 1 in reserve
[2:05:23] <MikeStark> Keep 1
[2:05:25] <+ppangboi> I'd hold maybe one
[2:05:25] <+Tredecian> save for rerolls
[2:05:25] <%The48thCrow> save
[2:05:27] <Press_X_ToJASON> I always saved the for thoughts
[2:05:27] <+athuramn> walkthroughs would tell you to save. but you also have god powers through chat
[2:05:27] <%Broand> do you want to win white checks or red checks?
[2:05:27] <%Blackleafx> Raising authority will be important later
[2:05:28] <%dalmek> I did the "save them for checks" strategy but you do you
[2:05:29] <+JustToWatch> unlock another thought slot
[2:05:30] <+athuramn> so does it really matter
[2:05:30] <teefpal> He's the best Skill
[2:05:30] <+Damie904> Use em
[2:05:30] <digaogrunge> WAIT
[2:05:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt always level volition
[2:05:34] <+ALazo> use them all immediately and then regret it later
[2:05:35] <faegbeard> use a few, you might be missing the cheeky passive checks
[2:05:35] <+Riecharus> Having just one skill point seems okay. You don't want to miss passive checks
[2:05:36] <BiologicGases> use like 1 or 2
[2:05:36] <user_naim> Use one, save two
[2:05:37] <Bootkiller6> you can also use skill points to unlock thought slots
[2:05:37] <Gameaholic42> Wait for important checks
[2:05:37] <Nohorse> I save 1
[2:05:38] <%Kataguro> Shivers, Visual Calculus, Logic
[2:05:38] <%holydeviant1> One is all you need for a redo
[2:05:40] <+pectusumbra> Up to you. You can either build what you want to be or save them for whatever comes up that tempts you
[2:05:41] <%Standard_Enemy> Fuck around and find out
[2:05:41] <RiverFatal> Save  them
[2:05:42] <ingman112> If you never upgrade you miss out on passives. Use a few, save one for a rainy day
[2:05:42] <Mucmaster> You'll be fine either way but personally I like to save them
[2:05:43] <+mczarklesby> Personally I'd save most of them. Maybe stuff that gets high passives like perception, inland, shivers. But.. really no rush.
[2:05:43] <Tisaric> I always kept 1
[2:05:45] <penitentpendant> What did you need for the conversation with the girl in front of the store?
[2:05:45] <Visorak6> Shivers 4 for passive procs
[2:05:45] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Thought Slot and Skill
[2:05:46] <@SSaryn> Keeping 1 is also good.
[2:05:46] <Press_X_ToJASON> thought slots are STRONG
[2:05:47] <Gameaholic42> Just save scum a lot
[2:05:47] <%BigCoffee> get more skills spread out
[2:05:49] <+ppangboi> the game rolls passive checks sometimes without telling you
[2:05:49] <kikoeru_san> always keep one
[2:05:49] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Level up one, open a slot, and save the third?
[2:05:49] <brachydios777> Put it into physical
[2:05:53] <%Blackleafx> psaElmo
[2:05:53] <digaogrunge> Yeah, keep 1
[2:05:53] <Astrophizz> I just held onto 1
[2:05:54] <+evbites> volition
[2:05:55] <teefpal> Pick what you feel is best for your build
[2:05:55] <%WhereIsWill> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[2:05:55] <%Standard_Enemy> Im kidding lol save em

[2:05:57] <penitentpendant> Check your quest log for locked rolls
[2:05:57] <+purps26> upgrade your favorites. you will pass more hidden checks
[2:06:00] <Visorak6> yeyeyeye
[2:06:00] <+swesterly> thought slots though
[2:06:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> I support the fuck around and find out option
[2:06:02] <Nohorse> Hell yeah shivers PogChamp
[2:06:03] <$RealThiele> hand-eye
[2:06:05] <%Kataguro> These are both very good picks
[2:06:15] <+ppangboi> solid choices for sure
[2:06:17] <bettysharkface> mmmm shivers
[2:06:20] <%maybefalco> you get a lot of skill points over the course of the game, but always keep one in case you desperately need it for a red roll
[2:06:22] <bettysharkface> Shivers has the good lore
[2:06:23] <%Blackleafx> psaUp
[2:06:24] <+athuramn> I'm interested to see where shivers will go
[2:06:25] <%luftraumm1> shivers, perception, instrument
[2:06:29] <teefpal> yeah its a good skill
[2:06:29] <%Kataguro> Shivers just gives you content
[2:06:31] <popcultureaficionado> nah should have went with reaction speed
[2:06:35] <%holydeviant1> Shivers is cool
[2:06:37] <Blank9> shivers is overrated as fuck
[2:06:43] <teefpal> Pain Threshold is a dick though
[2:06:50] <iosephe> oh sick
[2:06:50] <jorniev> cause you got the map
[2:06:52] <%The48thCrow> go fight the phrenologist
[2:06:55] <+pectusumbra> alright, past sleep time for me. good night all
[2:06:57] <kikoeru_san> does pat have bow collector?
[2:07:00] <Mucmaster> Those two skills are nice to level up cause they can cause checks while exploring
[2:07:01] <+athuramn> if you fail them this time, then you need to put another point in btw
[2:07:03] <%juxtest> Shiver legendarily
[2:07:04] <BiologicGases> not gonna ask about instruments but thats an interesting pick
[2:07:05] <cardamomo88> YES
[2:07:05] <+pectusumbra> damn it, I'll watch this at least
[2:07:08] <@SSaryn> Some White Checks will reset per day as well I should add. Not a lot but some.
[2:07:10] <%Kataguro> @kikoeru_san No
[2:07:15] <jorniev> twait
[2:07:15] <%luftraumm1> physical instrument is cool as fuck
[2:07:19] <teefpal> He'll need to level up more if he wants to beat the CEO of Racism
[2:07:20] <kikoeru_san> shit

[2:07:28] <kikoeru_san> that's not good
[2:07:30] <cardamomo88> OH YES
[2:07:32] <Nohorse> Physical Instrument is the GIGACHAD stat
[2:07:32] <@SSaryn> We did. He baby.
[2:07:33] <+pectusumbra> see what?

[2:08:12] <teefpal> Remember when we were hunter gatherers and hunted with dogs?

[2:08:20] <teefpal> Now we are potato
[2:08:22] <kikoeru_san> he'll be fine, just manually pump shivers
[2:08:24] <Bootkiller6> yeah it's gone for good
[2:08:35] <%luftraumm1> dices are so good tho
[2:08:39] <Bootkiller6> the dice gives a different stat bonus if you have the one or both together
[2:08:42] <%The48thCrow> remember when dogs first came to us and were like "got any bones"
[2:08:45] <teefpal> Fat baby boys
[2:08:46] <+purplestufff> hey pat, nice dog
[2:08:48] <@commanderclaw> The failure mechanics are important thematically, if you can't regret failing a check you're not really in character
[2:08:49] <MikeStark> FLASHLIGHT
[2:08:57] <Gameaholic42> Chat cheating your stats will be your die
[2:08:57] <@SSaryn> Yes actually.
[2:09:00] <penitentpendant> I think it won't let you move through the area w/o the flashlight
[2:09:04] <+swesterly> @teefpal careful with the spoilers, two dudes earlier fucked around and found out just saying

[2:16:37] <+mczarklesby> My signature is half-light. NOT FUN GUYS.
[2:16:40] <%elhafnero> one of the bad ones
[2:16:54] <Nohorse> Bulit
[2:16:54] <%Kataguro> Half-Light is an asshole

[2:17:43] <aiutare47> @mczarklesby tell you people are out to get you, and you need to fight them

[2:18:01] <jorniev> Volition helped me through depresion in real ife
[2:18:03] <walaladun> @mczarklesby but being paranoid wrecks is legit fun
[2:18:21] <jorniev> like for real helped real me
[2:18:25] <PartyFavors> @jorniev yeah, sometimes I think about Volition's lines to help me in my day to day.
[2:18:39] <kanin_usagi> @jorniev hell yeah dude, good to hear
[2:18:40] <brachydios777> I feel like elctro chemistry would freak out anyone who is recovering from addiction
[2:18:44] <penitentpendant> 50 years, you say
[2:18:50] <%luftraumm1> volition is a good guy
[2:19:03] <+mczarklesby> I was making a joke about IRL half-light as people were talking about IRL Electrochem
[2:19:09] <Nohorse> Kim is the real SUPERSTAR COP
[2:19:11] <Nohorse> I love him
[2:19:11] <%luftraumm1> electro chemistry is very real
[2:19:17] <$TheDrugWeCallWifi> @brachydios777 I'll say that sometimes it's nice to hear addiction laid out so obviously, because it's so obvious to refute it in that state. in real life it can be a little sneakier
[2:19:20] <walaladun> @mczarklesby half light is used to detect threats and employs threat, but mostly push you to be a paranoid wreck
[2:19:23] <Saltmeisterr> CMON
[2:19:24] <mattynezz> YEEE
[2:19:28] <jorniev> GAME  JUST TELLING YOU

[2:19:43] <Chatterbox1991> Post Soviet Black Market shit
[2:19:49] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> don't sell the shit you find, they are important
[2:20:00] <aiutare47> @jorniev Honestly, yeah. Theres a super powerful line Pat missed. "You didnt get up because of speed, you got up because of a promise. A promise you made to me. To stop wasting Life."
[2:20:05] <jorniev> pat feeling good about WINING
[2:20:06] <yourliteraldog> Soviet Surplus nice

[2:20:37] <+Riecharus> huh
[2:20:41] <$thomassolorio> I'd save the game
[2:20:41] <brachydios777> I wonder how many AKs went on the black market post soviet colapse
[2:20:56] <aiutare47> @brachydios777 Literally uncountable
[2:20:59] <%Kataguro> Enough that they're in every video game forever
[2:21:03] <jorniev> this part is weird
[2:21:05] <%Blackleafx> This is more of a Mosin-Nagant than AK tho
[2:21:13] <%Blackleafx> Breach roading rifle, not an automatic
[2:21:18] <aiutare47> Croatia tried and failed to track down the fraction they knew about
[2:21:19] <kanin_usagi> @brachydios777 there's a Nic cage movie about it even
[2:21:19] <+mczarklesby> @brachydios777 Anywhere in the world with a machine shop multiplied by 10,000. Minimum.

[2:21:56] <user_naim> i m a g i n e
[2:21:57] <%Blackleafx> @Bluwizard21 Its a pun on Reval (the capital of Estonia, where the developers are from) and Ravanchole (A famous French anarchist)
[2:21:57] <aPictureInMotion> that'd be a fuckin nightmare eh
[2:21:57] <jorniev> THIS GAME IS AMAZING
[2:21:58] <Saltmeisterr> HMMMM
[2:22:01] <walaladun> the law enforcing this gun law is full of irony though
[2:22:02] <%Tuna_Can_0> KKona not my merica
[2:22:03] <%luftraumm1> moralintern is very complicated
[2:22:03] <%Kataguro> Muzzle load that shit
[2:22:09] <brachydios777> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:22:09] <%The48thCrow> @aiutare47 yep just happened just now
[2:22:12] <+Catpurnicus> just carry 20 guns
[2:22:12] <%NovaKnightmare> then Swords become more viable
[2:22:12] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[2:22:12] <trickster721> Convenient for gameplay and storytelling too.
[2:22:13] <muXPerience> atpCap
[2:22:17] <Nohorse> That's why you carry 8 pistols, Pat LUL
[2:22:17] <+Catpurnicus> like a pirate
[2:22:17] <%Ranryu692> you mean like how it was when the 2nd Amendment was written?
[2:22:27] <kanin_usagi> that was how guns were for like centuries
[2:22:30] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Carry 100 pistols like derringer meryl
[2:22:31] <ShiningAxis> when that was the case, soldiers would carry a backup pistol for a second shot
[2:22:32] <dinnydanny777> Flintlock up every sleeve
[2:22:33] <%luftraumm1> sword cops would be scary
[2:22:33] <Chatterbox1991> IT'S ALMOST AS IF SELLING THT SHIT WITH LITTLE REGLATION IS A BAD IDEA
[2:22:34] <NeroInfinite> yeeah the problem in america is cops get miltiary weapons so bleh
[2:22:36] <+morethantwo> I can't believe they've voiced all the things. I'm going to have to play it through again.
[2:22:36] <+evbites> DAMN YOU PROGRESS
[2:22:37] <digaogrunge> Carry several guns
[2:22:38] <%Kataguro> The Pirate did it
[2:22:44] <%Extrallent> We'd still have piece of shit cops shooting people.
[2:22:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Minutemen, eh
[2:22:51] <BiologicGases> 6 seconds for a musket shot if youre good at it lol
[2:22:53] <ChungusQuest> Gunblades
[2:22:56] <+swesterly> true, but there are millions of firearms that work very differently already in circulation so it is kind of a moot point
[2:23:00] <teefpal> God the VA is so smooth
[2:23:02] <%mads_valentine> Airguns existed when the 2nd amendment was written.
[2:23:03] <%Valdorick> Sword cops wouldn't be a thing... they're be spear cops @luftraumm1
[2:23:04] <%Blackleafx> Good job Pat!
[2:23:05] <+DrGecko> Man this game has a lot of words
[2:23:06] <%Mr_Pylon> day 2 is a banger
[2:23:07] <cardamomo88> NICE ROLLS
[2:23:12] <aiutare47> @Ranryu692 not to be that guy, but there were some heavy shit available to the militias, mortars and bombs come to mind
[2:23:14] <Nohorse> Shit-nightmare is very fitting for Disco Man, isn't it?
[2:23:17] <penitentpendant> To be fair, a lot of the setup, the fridge and the rifle, paid off today
[2:23:20] <%Valdorick> they'd*
[2:23:21] <Saltmeisterr> Yesterday?
[2:23:23] <walaladun> i mean in Disco Elysium, cops ares still boasting about their kills

[2:23:24] <%Blackleafx> pat what are you doing
[2:23:25] <mattynezz> Pathfinding
[2:23:27] <%Alazull> You gotta go all the way up
[2:23:29] <Saltmeisterr> oh right lol
[2:23:31] <Gameaholic42> It's one of my favorite details in Black Flag where the only way you can shoot more bullets is to carry more guns
[2:23:33] <jorniev> THE most advanced guns in this world shoot like a early ww1 gun
[2:23:36] <digaogrunge> PAT
[2:23:36] <%luftraumm1> @valdorick spear cops would be even scarier
[2:23:39] <+evbites> Pat take your pants off
[2:23:39] <%Blackleafx> Also if you get the bullet on day 1, Kim is INCREDIBLY impressed at the end of day briefing
[2:23:44] <teefpal> Uh yeah they're cops, not goodguys

[2:29:50] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt So, have you ever actually beaten the game, Pat?
[2:29:51] <penitentpendant> You can't boost core stats outside of thoughts, so...
[2:29:51] <BiologicGases> meth hug?
[2:29:52] <+evbites> aww
[2:29:52] <+DrGecko> Do they have Chek cola in Canada?
[2:29:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> got a raise and a fat check, can buy a good prebuilt now
[2:29:53] <Nohorse> Do BIG DRUGS to boost stats SwiftRage
[2:29:53] <%Blackleafx> <3
[2:29:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> you could also do other things, level a bit and come back. Grind a little
[2:29:56] <kanin_usagi> are you a cop? you have to tell me if you're a cop?
[2:29:56] <%torusendor> YOU CAN HAVE BOTH
[2:29:58] <+swesterly> hugs are overrated, take the meth
[2:30:00] <%MelBrooksKA> Taking my night drugs
[2:30:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> prebuilt as in computer, my bad
[2:30:03] <hippofant> @aiutare47 A permanent skill point invested in a skill unlocks all which checks based on that skill for another attempt.
[2:30:04] <%Tuna_Can_0> moon2CUTE
[2:30:05] <yourliteraldog> Drugs and Hugs
[2:30:06] <user_naim> disco balls freezing
[2:30:07] <ChungusQuest> Nobody ever suggests hugs AND drugs.
[2:30:09] <%luftraumm1> don't do drugs
[2:30:13] <teefpal> Ah, the chair
[2:30:14] <%Kataguro> Fuck that chair
[2:30:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hug a meth head. Get both.
[2:30:16] <faithless_zealot> Ah
[2:30:18] <PartyFavors> Nice
[2:30:19] <%Alazull> You got a reality low-down?
[2:30:22] <hippofant> @aiutare47 Temporary bonuses do not. SOME green event bonuses will unlock, but rarely.
[2:30:22] <kanin_usagi> aces low was sick
[2:30:26] <NeutrinoInteraction> That fuckin chair
[2:30:26] <ChungusQuest> @yourliteraldog Well just make a liar out of my, why dontcha? LUL
[2:30:27] <aiutare47> @hippofant Right, I mean the temporary boosts we give him
[2:30:27] <Nohorse> Aces low is one of my big favorites Kreygasm
[2:30:29] <BiologicGases> did chair kill you?
[2:30:32] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt Well this aught to be interesting, then!
[2:30:34] <penitentpendant> Aces Low is a GREAT thought
[2:30:35] <AvroEltz> did you speak with the union thugs?
[2:30:38] <%WhereIsWill> that game is so good
[2:30:38] <cardamomo88> i hate that chair
[2:30:39] <DSD24> Oh man reality low down
[2:30:39] <%Alazull> Kim is life
[2:30:40] <DartAran> It upsets me this art style makes a shipping yard look cool and interesting
[2:30:41] <%luftraumm1> reality low down is important
[2:30:42] <%Blackleafx> We all love Kim
[2:30:45] <%Kataguro> Kim's the best RPG companion ever
[2:30:45] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you need that
[2:30:45] <kanin_usagi> you can kiss him on the lips
[2:30:45] <+maxteammagus> Struggling with Electrochemistry
[2:30:46] <brachydios777> This game seems like it would be really weird to play with no dialogue
[2:30:46] <Nohorse> @PatStaresAt Imagine for a second that there are MONSTERS out there that left Kim hanging
[2:30:47] <cardamomo88> MAYBE
[2:30:47] <hippofant> @aiutare47 Nope. Well... I'm pretty sure no, since I'm not a streamer.
[2:30:47] <%Alazull> Best partner for sure.
[2:30:47] <teefpal> lol
[2:30:48] <NeutrinoInteraction> We all wish that
[2:30:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Kim's the fucking best

[2:30:58] <+mczarklesby> I love Kim but, let's be real he can do better.
[2:30:59] <teefpal> He'd appreciate that
[2:31:02] <aGuyFromPleven> Reality lowdown doesn't happen when you think it does
