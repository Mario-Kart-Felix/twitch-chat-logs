[0:26:59] <%TheMattman1313> But Boruto though
[0:27:00] <Jetsfantasy> It was Kaguya and the final NaruSasu fight
[0:27:00] <%Dementedpenguin> It turns into bad fan fiction
[0:27:01] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> He had a headache by the end of it
[0:27:01] <%Diana869> Woolies chat is always kinda rude

[0:27:11] <deadredeyez> what
[0:27:11] <%BubbaRands> NALTS AN ALIEN
[0:27:11] <%Yummy_Nukes> HABEEB IT
[0:27:11] <dmian07> Moon aliens
[0:27:11] <Lionrebellion> so its game of thrones?
[0:27:11] <stphor> Naruto is about ninjas
[0:27:11] <%j0ustar> what
[0:27:12] <%Fien111> yyyyyyup
[0:27:13] <BallerSwagBro9k> EVERYONE IS ALIENS
[0:27:13] <%Aydarkzero> not even cool aliens
[0:27:13] <%TheMattman1313> And Boruto is about MORE ALIENS
[0:27:14] <%DappercatEsquire> it was aliens the whole time
[0:27:14] <tubit> what
[0:27:15] <%DensityD> wtf are ninjas, we like aliens
[0:27:17] <Jetsfantasy> NINJA JESUS AND THE MOON
[0:27:17] <%nofestu2> it has KAGUYA in it?
[0:27:19] <%devanmuse> ninja magic comes from MOON ALIENS
[0:27:21] <%General_Terro> aliens with magic eyes
[0:27:21] <%Agami23> naruto and sasuke are reincarnations of space ninja jesus and space ninja judas respectively.
[0:27:21] <stphor> What do you mean aliens
[0:27:22] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> All ninjas are the descendants of aliens :)
[0:27:23] <%GarbageNirvana> The Evil Council are ALIENS
[0:27:23] <%happyface699> Oh
[0:27:24] <ajrmeps2> NINJAS
[0:27:25] <%weissguard> The "Village Hidden in the Leaves" HAS SKYSCRAPERS ON THE MOUNTAIN BEHIND IT.
[0:27:25] <%maenos2> MOON RABBIT ALIENS
[0:27:26] <%DensityD> giraffe blow job
[0:27:27] <%zestyArsenic> FF7 is about aliens but thats rad. Naruto about aliens is dumb.
[0:27:29] <%coreyyotto> The main problem is that the game gave like zero context for anything that was happening
[0:27:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @BallerSwagBro9k Feel bad about making daughter attractive sexually but it's for the good of the bloodline
[0:27:30] <laschoelmachooo> now I gonna watch that woolie destruction
[0:27:31] <dan_g_v> look, the only thing that matters is the Nalt/Taimanin Asagi crossovers. Ninja girls and tentacles ftw

[0:27:39] <%DedlokPM> @nofestu2 Kaguya is basically the final boss of the story
[0:27:40] <LenDawsonsFresca> What the actual hell do you mean Naruto is about aliens?
[0:27:41] <%nofestu2> fucking lunarians at it again
[0:27:41] <%Aydarkzero> Arch Tempered Namiele is tough
[0:27:42] <stphor> Naruto is the worst
[0:27:42] <%Dementedpenguin> The War arc basically ends with "Look ALIENS" LUL
[0:27:43] <%Ultimatefool> 87? WEAK
[0:27:44] <%televisedrevolting> So I just got through Promare, shit's great and I want Lio to set me on fire.
[0:27:44] <cipher758> space ninjas
[0:27:45] <+xerotwo> LUL
[0:27:46] <stphor> the actual worst
[0:27:47] <%mckraven> not even just aliens but Nalt and Sasuke are reincarnation of those aliens
[0:27:47] <scrublord009> There are some wipeouts in Naruto
[0:27:48] <%DensityD> "HANH?"
[0:27:49] <+DesertPenguin> After she beats Dark Souls 2
[0:27:52] <possumwalsh1221> All ninja powers are just alien powers ninjas built the pyramids

[0:27:57] <%Aydarkzero> Dark Souls 2 though?
[0:27:57] <%aslfrasle> Ninja Jesus was actually an alien and both Naruto and Sasuke are both related and at least part-alien themselves.
[0:28:00] <%Zombrocom> Ragin brach only needs MR 24 though
[0:28:00] <jeffthesequel> So it's like game of thrones.

[0:34:13] <%happyface699> Show bepis
[0:34:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Since paige is a goliath in real life and pat is a Lalafel in real life it makes sense that paige becomes a lalafel in FF14

[0:34:16] <%Niney_Who> Even THEM'S FIGHTING HERDS has ROLLBACK NETCODE

[0:44:41] <OldManDeckardCain> I have been waiting 20 years to buy a pc
[0:44:41] <%aishman> There is ALWAYS a new one coming out
[0:44:41] <Manwad> 16g of ram will see you through most shit
[0:44:42] <Onamar> They come out EVERY YEAR
[0:44:43] <%Jekado> RTX 3000 series
[0:44:43] <%zyberion626> your new computer is outdated as soon as you buy the parts
[0:44:43] <+DinnerCalzone> No matter what, even if you buy the newest stuff, it will always be "outdated" in a few months
[0:44:44] <%AmericanaRed> i9
[0:44:44] <%SilverDevilfish> "Hey guys I am on a budget, should I buy the most expensive cpu that I don't need?"
[0:44:44] <mMayrro> and then your pc blows up
[0:44:45] <+emperordread> psaHoldon
[0:44:46] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[0:44:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> NEW ONES ARE ALWAYS COMING OUT LUL
[0:44:47] <+gimmickypizza> Wait until you die
[0:44:47] <%Elky3> LUL
[0:44:47] <%hawk_rush> don't wait, just get the cheapest part that is still super good
[0:44:48] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt just wait until the heat death of the universe, then you can build your pc
[0:44:49] <%kewlmyc> I just get what the current model is
[0:44:49] <BunnyEmperor> of course the new ones are overpriced
[0:44:49] <%Jekado> yeyeyeyeyeyeye
[0:44:50] <$Mopopolis> LUL
[0:44:50] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap
[0:44:50] <hectic_harlequin> God it's so fucking stupid
[0:44:50] <%j0ustar> He's right
[0:44:50] <%BubbaRands> just wait a couple months
[0:44:51] <%pectusumbra> just be poor so you can't upgrade to new
[0:44:52] <%Typhaeon> Ughhhh
[0:44:52] <Nekros4442> Eh, I dont buy the "new one" anyway. It's always gonna be too expensive
[0:44:54] <bigshedman> Isn't there ALWAYS something new coming out though?
[0:44:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> do now do now do now DO NOW
[0:44:56] <%Dingus_Tickler> BuildaPCSales has nerds who do the work for you for FREE @patstaresat
[0:44:56] <generalve> LUL
[0:44:56] <%bluebiscuit94> ROUND AND ROUND IT GOES
[0:44:57] <%AncelDeLambert> basically, yeah
[0:45:00] <%televisedrevolting> Electronics are obsolete the moment you buy them.
[0:45:01] <mMayrro> ok boomer
[0:45:01] <%Nupinoop296> Diablo II good
[0:45:02] <tubit> Dude my 486 DX2 works just fine. I can wait
[0:45:05] <%Zombrocom> The new ones coming out makes the old ones cheaper though
[0:45:05] <+cursedwithadhd> that's the whole point to g
[0:45:06] <generalve> Geforce 2 ?! PogChamp
[0:45:07] <+Carquar> DDR5 is coming out soon, but don't buy because they'll be slower than the current DDR4's
[0:45:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The Super are AMAZING to buy when they came out
[0:45:09] <%Undenizen> Well, the good news is there are NEVER new GPUs coming out. that shit has been frozen FOREVER.
[0:45:10] <%RedKnightVI> 100% true
[0:45:12] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Reason you should wait is for when the preorders to go up so you can grab a used 2080-2070 for way less than you should
[0:45:13] <%Spydurman> Actual tip? Find a good computer shop in town to help you build it
[0:45:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Just look for something that is close to cutting edge without being bleeding edge
[0:45:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> TIME TRAVEL FOR THE FINAL PC
[0:45:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Even Crazy Talk isn't strong enough for this great truth
[0:45:15] <awalr> just wait and buy everything from your coffin
[0:45:16] <%RedKnightVI> 100% unhelpful XD
[0:45:18] <%spiritofmojave> SURE IS
[0:45:18] <yeetdabsenpai69> so just wait
[0:45:18] <%j0ustar> Just buy the best you can at the moment you decide to do it end of story
[0:45:18] <%Typhaeon> In terms of GPU power, it's really slowed down in the past few years
[0:45:18] <+DinnerCalzone> So advice: buy what's good that's affordable
[0:45:19] <%Pappajimbo> waiting for gpugoddo
[0:45:20] <oniwahoo> @dnnyhell Pat wanted to know if Woolie got to the part where Orochimaru goes free
[0:45:20] <+Crimsonstripe> Work on somthing you want to upgrade down the road
[0:45:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> You don't get the new ones, you always get the present old ones at lower price
[0:45:21] <rubbishbinge> just use ur dad's computer

[0:46:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Be a bard
[0:46:33] <%RedKnightVI> Healer makes your soul die
[0:46:33] <Jetsfantasy> HEALER IS BABYSITTING CHILDREN
[0:46:33] <%Arxel1> Being a healer is for people that can handle being BIG MAD Paige
[0:46:34] <%GalacticaPhanto> she'd be dps hard
[0:46:34] <%MisterRockett> LET HER DO WHAT SHE WANTS, PAT.

[0:46:39] <jyeowa> LUL TRUE

[0:46:44] <%suikudo> MONKS ARE THE TRUTH

[0:46:45] <%valriot> BLACK MAGE PAIGE PogChamp
[0:46:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Healers are subs or tired
[0:46:46] <AMDBR9S> WHM Rise Ups
[0:46:47] <%Nupinoop296> being a healer requires a LOT of patience. i know, i'm a WHM main
[0:46:47] <%GalacticaPhanto> also as a WHM I can agree
[0:46:48] <%Wallabri> as a WHM main........ yeah
[0:46:49] <%zyberion626> healers are for depressed masochists
[0:46:49] <%Tucker0603> this is true
[0:46:49] <+ultimafullmetal> adjust
[0:46:49] <blackbeaking> healers are basically babysitters in thatgame
[0:46:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> By that logic, Aerith should be a massive condescending bitch
[0:46:52] <%spiritofmojave> and have to perform well for others CONSTANTLY
[0:46:53] <BunnyEmperor> Paige play Tank, you don't need to be good and get away with everything
[0:46:54] <%Arxel1> Healer is babysitting 3-12 kids
[0:46:54] <%bearking05> yeah
[0:46:56] <$sniffy77> I love tired healer comics
[0:46:57] <%BigCoffee> @valriot Black Maige
[0:46:58] <%BubbaRands> JUST DON'T GET HIT
[0:46:59] <ShdwDstryr> I burned out on healing at level 73
[0:47:02] <+MidnightBurst12> healers are glorified babysitters
[0:47:02] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I'm feeling really shitty and awful right now about past relationships and I'm happy you guys are streaming! You two always put me in a good mood. :)
[0:47:02] <jyeowa> @BigCoffee TERRIBLE idea the full ninja rotation is basically playing keyboard piano
[0:47:05] <PyroBluPhoenix> unless you want to scream and hate everyone you team up with don't go healer
[0:47:05] <%manwithboxonhead> I like being a Rogue or a Wizard.
[0:47:07] <dmian07> I believe all healers will get bald at some time
[0:47:07] <Brainworm205> As a former healer main, can confirm
[0:47:08] <namisrot> paige i love ur tiger trousers
[0:47:08] <CyborgAV> I healed a lvl 80 roulette last week where the SAM was wearing level 70 gear
[0:47:08] <%ImmaCanuck> Imagine Paige trying to learn positional-based abilities
[0:47:09] <%televisedrevolting> To any future healers: Be prepared to not be appreciated and be surrounded by idiots.
[0:47:10] <%spiritofmojave> YEAH
[0:47:11] <%DEETRz> i been WHM main heavensward, i freaking hate every pub player i meet
[0:47:11] <%Nekros4442> Nekros4442 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:47:14] <%suikudo> Where my greased lightning boys!?
[0:47:15] <jimmypurple> Healers are the alcoholic moms who just watch everyone else fuck up
[0:47:16] <%Nekros4442> Hey Pat, I've unsubbed from most of my monthly payment things cus of the covid but I found I still have some leeway. Here's some muns and Remerai is fucking amazing.
[0:47:17] <%Pappajimbo> @GarbageQueenEllie isnt she??
[0:47:18] <%Aydarkzero> yeah being a Healer is awful

[0:47:20] <%walternatorz> healers adjust
[0:47:20] <tubit> Healer role: carry everyone else
[0:47:21] <derap41> Welcome to Healing in MMOs
[0:47:21] <%Shonen_hero> you get to fix big mistakes as a healer. It's awful
[0:47:25] <rubbishbinge> WAR has been ok to me
[0:47:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Healers are super pissed off or super patient. You need raw fury or the patients of a saint to be a healer
[0:47:28] <%Nupinoop296> @DEETRz big mood
[0:47:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Pappajimbo Yeah but like even more so
[0:47:30] <ToneBacas> so babysitting?
[0:47:30] <missingangle> Those pants are crazy, Paige, I love them
[0:47:31] <%UvBenServed> SHUT UP YOU DON'T PAY MY SUB
[0:47:32] <%spiritofmojave> When I see mentors who don't know how to big pull tank I lose it
[0:47:32] <+REDtheBEAST> ADJUST
[0:47:33] <%Dr_DangerPhD> being a healer is like spinning plates but a group of jackasses is trying to constantly knock them over
[0:47:36] <%HRDSalami654> But why didn't you heal me though?
[0:47:36] <blackbeaking> I levelled all 3 healers back to back and wanted to kill everyone
[0:47:38] <%AngriestAngryArtist> TIGER PANTS!
[0:47:39] <%Typhaeon> You also have to do damage.
[0:47:39] <%ergulor> being a parent
[0:47:41] <soflicar> Hey that my job.
[0:47:41] <+chrishnaw> Is this gonna be a co-op stream with Peach?
[0:47:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> "healer wtf heal me"
[0:47:42] <Jetsfantasy> "Healers adjust"
[0:47:42] <+klassikFrank> Playing any kind of healer/support in an online game is basically working retail.
[0:47:42] <derap41> Paige should be the one fucking up no theh fixer
[0:47:43] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt I'm only about lvl 10-25 in all the combat classes, and I think marauder's the easiest class to progress with
[0:47:43] <%zestyArsenic> Paige confirmed DRG on ground for 99% of fight

[0:48:07] <%spiritofmojave> I leveled all my healers to 80 and basically am gonna quit for several months
[0:48:09] <Jetsfantasy> Stop healing the complainers at least
[0:48:09] <+textandnumbers> weird, i rather heal than thank in ff14
[0:48:09] <Fujiwara_92> HEALERS ADJUST
[0:48:10] <%weissguard> This explains a lot.
[0:48:11] <%MisterRockett> WHM is legit fun right now tbh.
[0:48:12] <%DracaenaLeaf> Healers in Maplestory back in 2006 were sluts tbh
[0:48:13] <%manwithboxonhead> Prepare for people to bitch at you.
[0:48:14] <a_c_chirns> what about the many many boss fights with weird esoteric mechanics that spike you if you don't know them ahead of time
[0:48:15] <dmian07> Only tanks get commendations
[0:48:16] <venomfury86> Heal girl Kappa
[0:48:18] <%DensityD> SHOES
[0:48:20] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Pat remind me which classes I should play if I want to pretend to be Revolver Ocelot blam blam gun man?
[0:48:20] <%GoopyEuclid> Healing sounds like being a teacher
[0:48:22] <%MrBorisMakarov> DNC RISE UP
[0:48:22] <%DEETRz> wait until its savage where they get one shot and you dont even get a chance to heal, only res their fallen ass
[0:48:23] <%Explodincatz> ALL players should play every role at least once
[0:48:26] <+OwlLightningMage> No appreciates healers either
[0:48:29] <rubbishbinge> but everyone wanna be dps
[0:48:29] <%TimetodiveLTX> steal their shoes to understand

[0:48:31] <%Dakuu75> !uptime
[0:48:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 48m 33s.
[0:48:33] <%ImmaCanuck> At least healers in FFXIV can actually do damage instead of just, "stand and wait for green bar go down"
[0:48:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Tanking is too much pressure for me
[0:48:38] <%Diana869> its weird how i never meet toxic people in games like ff14 and stuff
[0:48:41] <%j0ustar> Paige can get aggro easily tho
[0:48:42] <+REDtheBEAST> tank buster!
[0:48:44] <%spiritofmojave> No one comms you if you actually parse/do well

[0:48:53] <%valriot> TANK
[0:48:54] <%iosephe> Not DPS
[0:48:54] <%TalisKanju> Play games for others, not for yourself
[0:48:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Tanks
[0:48:55] <%Explodincatz> tanking and heals
[0:48:55] <%Nupinoop296> i just started tanking (Paladin) and i'm so nervous about doing it badly and i ALWAYS give my healer my player commendation

[0:48:57] <%zyberion626> Tank is the keystone
[0:48:57] <%Tucker0603> tank
[0:48:58] <SharkTankAgito> Tank
[0:48:58] <%Partialrecall2> liar
[0:48:59] <$Mopopolis> People are dumb and take too much damage
[0:48:59] <%MakotoPB> must have a tank
[0:48:59] <rubbishbinge> Tank
[0:48:59] <+theotherkristian> Prominent
[0:48:59] <dmian07> Tanks get immediately pick
[0:48:59] <%AncelDeLambert> tank is super necessary yet easy
[0:49:00] <%LonePlus_> just hit with axe keep people away
[0:49:00] <redrins> yeah make us bust our asses off and dont use defensive cooldowns, we LOVE THAT

[0:49:04] <%Garthunox> @patstaresat I'm a tank main, but god damn if I dont appreciate my healers, you guys are amazing and I love you
[0:49:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> If the tank falls, it's a wipe
[0:49:06] <%UvBenServed> TANK GANG TANK GANG
[0:49:07] <laschoelmachooo> Healer
[0:49:07] <%Tucker0603> you always get yelled at
[0:49:08] <Jetsfantasy> Aggro in 14 relies on tank
[0:49:12] <tubit> For me tanking is so much easier than healing
[0:49:12] <rubbishbinge> Tank is the spine of the party
[0:49:13] <%Diana869> i can never memorize the tank busters names @PatStaresAt
[0:49:13] <%BubbaRands> DPS IS SCREWED WITHOUT TANK
[0:49:13] <%DEETRz> tanks are always in short supply
[0:49:13] <%Pyroclase> If the healer dies, the tank can pull through sometimes. If the tank dies...
[0:49:14] <Coystick> BARD
[0:49:14] <+Remery_> every1 and there mom wants to be DPS
[0:49:15] <%Partialrecall2> its healer why these tanks lying
[0:49:16] <dmian07> I have to wait 0 secs as a tank
[0:49:23] <%PsideFxX> TANK BOIS
[0:49:27] <%Nekros4442> Healers and Tanks will always be needed.
[0:49:27] <laschoelmachooo> Healer and Tank. they Depend on each other
[0:49:28] <%Lunaticbro > without tank everyone dies
[0:49:29] <%poker4121> tank gang
[0:49:32] <%TimetodiveLTX> everyone scared to get hit
[0:49:32] <%trianglehat> Tank sets the pace
[0:49:34] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:49:35] <%zyberion626> Healers and DPS die without a tank
[0:49:35] <derap41> DPS is what you should start as always
[0:49:35] <%ALazo> The least valuable is dps. At best you are a body that makes things go faster.
[0:49:35] <%Nupinoop296> as healer i always give the tank my player commendation
[0:49:35] <%Bailey__gaming> BIG
[0:49:36] <%manwithboxonhead> Ideal for a Tank is not to be a 100% meat shield, but also to inflict some real damage as well and keep the aggro on them.
[0:49:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I love being a tank
[0:49:36] <%Typhaeon> You can switch roles any time you want in FF14 Paige
[0:49:36] <%MoonObscure> lol
[0:49:36] <%GarbageNirvana> It's DPS when the expansion introduced a new tank class
[0:49:37] <%tigerfang86> HOT

[0:49:37] <Jetsfantasy> You can DPS and facefuck

[0:51:00] <Jetsfantasy> I didn't even know it had a word... TIL
[0:51:00] <$sniffy77> Amazing to see Paige's dream be crushed in front of 1500 people
[0:51:04] <%Pyroclase> Learning encounter is the roughest part of tanking because some people just don't have the patience to let you learn
[0:51:04] <%TimetodiveLTX> wow
[0:51:05] <oniwahoo> @otakon17 Game hasn't started yet
[0:51:05] <%WhereIsWill> You control the flow of battle!
[0:51:07] <%Dakuu75> Healer or DPS is WAY less stressful than tank
[0:51:07] <%michingmallecho> TANKS SET THE TONE
[0:51:10] <+Remery_> I love being a tanky big strong girl <3
[0:51:10] <%indig0bird> And to pull the mobs
[0:51:10] <%coreyyotto> For the purposes of a stream in which the party would be mostly subscribers, Paige being in the lead makes sense though
[0:51:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Not including tank swaps
[0:51:13] <%Felto3> 95% of the time its the centre of the arena
[0:51:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Tank is the drummer of the band?
[0:51:15] <CaptainFrankincense> tank is the drummer
[0:51:15] <%Aztec50> Pat is super correct
[0:51:16] <%optimasmaximas> ????
[0:51:16] <blackbeaking> tanks start the party
[0:51:16] <%solzan2000> responsibility and healers keep shit alive
[0:51:18] <%eyezehuhh> Just had someone Xbox message me and call me trash and say I wasn't healing him. I had to explain that I kept getting rolled and killed before I could reach anyone else. That's the healer life. We live to die.
[0:51:18] <%pectusumbra> tempo
[0:51:21] <stphor> Pace and speed
[0:51:21] <%DEETRz> people will yell at a tank if they pull too slowly
[0:51:24] <otakon17> Tanks set the pace? I thought Tanks just sat there and absorbed damage?
[0:51:24] <stphor> are the same
[0:51:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Does Pat have a monitor in front of him?
[0:51:24] <formlessTwitch> You said Rev2 and I thought you meant Guilty Gear. I'm upset
[0:51:24] <%Nupinoop296> it stresses me out in dungeons when people run ahead of me when i tank
[0:51:24] <%Bailey__gaming> Paige would be a good BIG melee dps

[1:08:42] <arcanemacrocosm> I called my mom by her first name once to be rebellious and it was the weirdest feeling
[1:08:45] <%Aydarkzero> this is a case where they gave up
[1:08:45] <+ScurvyMitch> @PatStaresAt remember they use more photorealism now which is hard, where back in older games it was weird hybrids
[1:08:45] <+softerdrinks> I think Leon looks okay

[1:25:41] <%happyface699> Herbie couldn’t talk but it was alive
[1:25:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Herbert Berbie: Rebirb the gurb slurb....... 3
[1:25:46] <dreu81> Can Moira make a bomb out of a potato?
[1:25:48] <%xcompleasedad> Invetigative Agents for the FBI don't get guns
[1:25:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> I can't even remember what Silent Hill's healing items were
[1:25:56] <%DappercatEsquire> Not all anti-bioterror work requires guns, except for all the anti-bioterror that's been covered by the RE series
[1:26:00] <AxelCezar> such a dumb mechanic
[1:26:02] <%Meekest> YOU LITERALLY DO
[1:26:02] <%optimasmaximas> yeah you do
[1:26:03] <peachy996> Ampoules Plague
[1:26:04] <%DukeBlack_> dual wield crowbar
[1:26:04] <%wsintai> @PlagueOfGripes HEALTH DRINK
[1:26:04] <%valriot> Yes you do???
[1:26:05] <%Omegaanimus> it's Terra-Save, not Terra-rist
[1:26:06] <+PlagueOfGripes> not as iconic as weed 1, 2 and 3
[1:26:07] <%worldbrand> health drink and ampoules
[1:26:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> ACQUIRE THE YAMATOBAR!
[1:26:08] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt psaWrong
[1:26:09] <%DukeBlack_> CRAZY TALK
[1:26:10] <Greywolf47> you do
[1:26:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> health drink and medpac
[1:26:15] <%happyface699> @plagueofgripes Energy drinks??
[1:26:16] <%Ipsenscastle> Wow I didn't know Pat could do a flawless Scottish accent
[1:26:17] <scrublord009> MOIRA ASSIST
[1:26:20] <%Tacowavable> Crowbar, a weapon for a more civilized age
[1:26:20] <rytisone> and then Moira killed Claire with crowbar
[1:26:24] <a_c_chirns> ENERGY DRINKS TOO
[1:26:26] <SoaringLettuce> lindsay Lohan was looking huge in the herbie movie
[1:26:26] <%TDotGoat> and ampules
[1:26:26] <SchroedingersFerret> ampules also
[1:26:27] <%NitronStreams> MOIRA STRONG
[1:26:27] <a_c_chirns> oops caps
[1:26:28] <CrimsonFox777> @PlagueOfGripes There weren't any. You had to go to the sexy nurses for help. Kappa
[1:26:30] <$PleasantLeech> don't forget the ampoule
[1:26:30] <$zackalan> Ampoule
[1:26:32] <dreu81> Can Moira make fishnet stockings out of a potato?
[1:26:33] <Fujiwara_92> ampules
[1:26:33] <scrublord009> And sexual frustration
[1:26:33] <possumwalsh1221> Health drink good drink
[1:26:33] <%Dementedpenguin> It's depressing how long it's been since there was a new Silent Hill game
[1:26:33] <%M4T1A5> You don't find out if you don't play far enough
[1:26:37] <%worldbrand> what if silent hill had bafmodads
[1:26:38] <%StarlitStunner> Health Drink
[1:26:44] <benjiFG> shiny
[1:26:50] <Coystick> Evil Within got the supersringe
[1:26:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I saw that something... in Silent Hill
[1:26:51] <artoflec> yeah they were just called health drinks, and ampoules would give you temporary invincibility on top of the biggest tier of heal
[1:26:52] <rytisone> rip
[1:26:52] <Fujiwara_92> there's was a shiny
[1:26:56] <+chaumiester> The reason is because Moira is a dumb
[1:26:56] <+PlagueOfGripes> They should have a horror game where you heal by eating offal out of a trough
[1:27:00] <%DappercatEsquire> @Dementedpenguin maybe the rumors are true and you can regret them making new ones soon
[1:27:07] <%happyface699> Evil within had HEROIN
[1:27:08] <%worldbrand> Not mustard?
[1:27:12] <SchroedingersFerret> Bafomdads are more appropriate in horror games anyway
[1:27:14] <venomfury86> crowbar - the perfect weapon for a silent protagonist
[1:27:15] <%YakumoYomi> Has Paige been successful at "spot dog"?
[1:27:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @PlagueOfGripes Lucky for us Last of Us 2 is coming out soon
[1:27:22] <%zombie_doctor> thats a stronge game plague

[1:27:32] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @PlagueOfGripes A horror game where you play as a pig?

[1:27:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> @PlagueOfGripes Boi youre all keyed up today LUL
[1:27:59] <%alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt does this take place before RE5?
[1:28:00] <BritishTyrannosaur> God this game is so good it's unreal
[1:28:00] <%happyface699> Alex is terrible
[1:28:05] <peachy996> Better than Col. Sanders
[1:28:09] <dreu81> A horror game where you don’t heal you just get progressively weaker
[1:28:10] <%Ipsenscastle> Does that not actually happen in a Machine for Pigs?
[1:28:11] <%Laecerelius> Pat doesn't have Matt's special eyes to depend on this time
[1:28:15] <%happyface699> She just spits of poetry
[1:28:16] <%M4T1A5> This is after RE5
[1:28:18] <$PleasantLeech> what's the difference of being spoke to or at?
[1:28:19] <olaksi> Could have given her a personality instead of constant kafka quotes
[1:28:20] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @alphonseisbest I believe this takes place before RE6
[1:28:29] <%NitronStreams> DOORS LOCKED
[1:28:29] <peachy996> @happyface699 so does Count Dooku from REV1

[1:28:37] <%happyface699> @peachy996 Oh god
[1:28:40] <%happyface699> Ugh
[1:28:45] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> who the fuck builds the traps in the re universe and says "yeah this is 100% foolproof"
[1:28:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @PleasantLeech given commands or having a conversation
[1:28:48] <%happyface699> I hated him too
[1:28:56] <%DappercatEsquire> @Dementedpenguin there were rumors earlier this year that there were two games in the works, that Konami denied (but who knows)
[1:29:03] <SoaringLettuce> @plagueofgripes please, you knew what you were doing
[1:29:04] <rytisone> Moira is inot bdsm
[1:29:06] <BritishTyrannosaur> You literally fight alex twice, she won in the end, her character closes the loose ends from RE5. I really don't see the problem
[1:29:07] <CrimsonFox777> @PleasantLeech Whether the speaker really means to convey info or just wants to listen to their own voice.
[1:29:13] <%optimasmaximas> yeah there is LUL
[1:29:15] <+PleasantLee> they didnt say important lore, they said lore
[1:29:15] <dreu81> A horror game where you can’t move and pushing a button just makes your character scream
[1:29:16] <$PleasantLeech> ah I see. thank you
[1:29:17] <%Pappajimbo> pro tip turn the flamer before turning it on so you dont destroy the upgrade
[1:29:17] <peachy996> I like Alex in that she has a plan and for once, the villain wins
[1:29:18] <%optimasmaximas> but it's spoilers
[1:29:18] <%happyface699> Kinky
[1:29:19] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah this game is just a game. with some cool Barry moments
[1:29:26] <KiroKadura> There's Alex? It's dumb but it's lore
[1:29:29] <SomeAsianDood> who's the little girl?
[1:29:29] <%Meidolaon> Alex is a pretty important piece of lore

[2:19:10] <rytisone> he's too lazy
[2:19:11] <%Estuko> Advice: Giving the child a gun and a sword lets her combine the two and she can perform Renzokuken on a zombie with the gunblade.

[2:35:19] <Jetsfantasy> @GalacticLatte If you have FFZ, they added a compressor that pitches the audio up when there's stream lag
[2:35:36] <peachy996> It's hilarious to hear Pat pitched up
[2:35:37] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @rumtumtugnutz that sounds nice.
[2:35:38] <%PanicSwytch> @rumtumtugnutz lmao
[2:35:42] <%Alopekis> Does anyone use the Opera web browser?
[2:35:42] <%GalacticLatte> @Jetsfantasy It keeps doing it LOL it's so weird, what is FFZ?
[2:35:44] <+bestcup> why does anime Pat look so thin and like he has a full head of hair?
[2:35:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Squad goals
[2:35:44] <%vextalyst> vextalyst subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Hey pat I disagree with the DMC anime being bad as i find it to be the perfect evolution od cutscene Dante. The anime stresses that he never struggles to the point that just like DMC4 the Last villian of the series could've been dealt with super early
[2:35:48] <mistermastergreg> I think they're dead
[2:35:51] <jogs29> there's some hardcore fckin happening right now
[2:36:02] <%realm_forge> It takes a while to squeeze the orb out completely. Then there’s cleanup....

[2:36:17] <BritishTyrannosaur> haha 420 channel points. haha funny drug number
[2:36:19] <peachy996> you need a squeegee to clean the pee
[2:36:25] <Jetsfantasy> @GalacticLatte It's a browser plugin for twitch but it looks like that isn't the issue anymore, somehow it's just now a Twitch issue then
[2:36:32] <%TalisKanju> Pat hates the thing you like even if he likes it
[2:36:41] <%Alopekis> Pat hates what I like. I like Pat's channel. Pat should delete his channel.
[2:36:42] <Greywolf47> pat survives by pissing off chat
[2:36:47] <venomfury86> Pat hates Bloodborne
[2:36:50] <ahandsomegentleman> @bestcup because in anime everyone is a hyper-beautifued version of themselves?

[2:37:00] <peachy996> oh yea

[2:56:08] <%walternatorz> this is the tech demo for last of us
[2:56:08] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Alan Wake is a good game. I'd like to see Paige play it tho...
[2:56:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I like when it breaks the 4th wall
[2:56:13] <%TheBenson8r> Still need to play that game

[2:56:20] <Marpolo13> SHINY
[2:56:21] <BritishTyrannosaur> Please make that AW dlc for control be something
[2:56:21] <%gaomachine> Wake was my favorite game from that company until Control came out
[2:56:25] <SMuffinMan> Nordic walking!
[2:56:30] <+MisterCrimson> Last of Us 2 looks worse than it sounds, jeez
[2:56:38] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you have to do it a second time to get him to activate, I think
[2:56:45] <+DrJamesWoods> Good Sound stuff going on
[2:56:45] <Calek> Alan Wake is my favourite game of all time

[2:57:48] <%optimasmaximas> @tigerfang86 so glad they decided to rewrite the script and completely restart development, this is so much better
[2:57:49] <%NitronStreams> Good job Brick
[2:57:52] <%a_goth_pancake> B R I C K
[2:58:08] <Calek> @Ipsenscastle they changed it because they realized how difficult it was to pace a horror story when the player can just ignore it for a couple hours
[2:58:14] <Greywolf47> Oh brick kun
[2:58:19] <Lionkevinson> 👉🏾
[2:58:20] <%Pappajimbo> look out its a monster

[2:58:45] <%michingmallecho> HahaBall
[2:58:46] <%NitronStreams> episode 2 in 2022
[2:58:46] <%Ipsenscastle> @Calek they were right! The TV episode gimmick was too far in the other direction though
[2:58:50] <SwindlerOfProgress> You can't stop me from complaining
[2:58:50] <%NWR_James> This streams might be of a measurable durration.
[2:58:55] <%GunEden> why bother with schedule
[2:58:57] <peachy996> What about those bad episodes with Natalya and Moira?
[2:58:58] <+Arkfyre> mass effect?
[2:59:00] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat and Peach stare at Hunter X Hunter PogChamp
[2:59:03] <%tigerfang86> MORE AA rooPog
[2:59:03] <Mrbaconator> COMPLAIN ALL THE TIME
[2:59:04] <+Remery_> Complaining is tradition at this point
[2:59:04] <%Gigagoat> I refuse to be happy
[2:59:04] <%walternatorz> why can't I complain now?
[2:59:08] <Mrbaconator> OMNI COMPLAIN
[2:59:08] <%ssjklyco> It's always later
[2:59:09] <rytisone> planning? on PatStaresAt?
[2:59:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I am furiously typing in advance
[2:59:14] <arkv01> moooonday? an eternity :(
[2:59:17] <Fujiwara_92> ill expect later and complain NOW
[2:59:21] <+laphyrion> @AMaidIndeed Nah, it's Seth's voice actor from Street Fighter IV.
[2:59:21] <%Movemeister> People love the masquerade
[2:59:22] <Calek> @Ipsenscastle I loved it, I did one episode a day and really got immersed
[2:59:25] <%GunEden> just do it freestyle
[2:59:27] <%Djinnazz> Onlyfans?
[2:59:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I prefer that, lets me finish up with work before you start
[2:59:27] <%colouroftheiris77> 5 PM is perfect
[2:59:28] <%michingmallecho> Ace Mondays BlessRNG BlessRNG
[2:59:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> But the schedule's a trick
[2:59:34] <+OwlLightningMage> I literally ignore Pat's schedule because I know it's a fucking lie
[2:59:36] <BritishTyrannosaur> Akan climbing raidio rowers to draw his map or whatever. grinding to defeat bossses. ewww
[2:59:48] <+DrJamesWoods> New BRick
[2:59:48] <TheWe4pon> Dokapon Kingdom?
[2:59:50] <%Ipsenscastle> @Calek what was really good was the Bright Falls web series they did with it
[3:00:10] <BritishTyrannosaur> What was the take on quantum break?
[3:00:13] <%arancet> Pat do everything you're not doing right now, but keep doing this too
[3:00:22] <peachy996> Reminded me of Evil Within there
[3:00:26] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wow, dat aim
[3:00:28] <BritishTyrannosaur> Angry joe's review was terrible. i thought the game was okay
[3:00:29] <%Ipsenscastle> @Calek but it disappeared after like a couple months. It was super cinematic!
[3:00:34] <%BubbaRands> great shooting Pat LUL
[3:00:36] <%Garthunox> PAT TURN OFF THE FLASHLIGHT TO STEALTH ATTACK
[3:00:44] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> good spotting
[3:00:47] <Calek> Quantum Break was a fun game but it ended on a cliffhanger and it's never getting a sequel, it's all about Control now
[3:00:54] <deadredeyez> uhnYou
[3:00:54] <SMuffinMan> I want Alan Wake 2
[3:00:59] <+DrJamesWoods> Brick it!
[3:01:06] <BritishTyrannosaur> Honestly control is a good trade off
[3:01:08] <Calek> Alan Wake 2 might actually be in development
[3:01:12] <+DrJamesWoods> Use your little girl strength
[3:01:12] <%SilverDevilfish> flesh pants
[3:01:19] <VJdarkworld> the monster :O
[3:01:22] <Greywolf47> Brick-kun needs to be thrown
[3:01:24] <%qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> "oh god, run bitch" one of my favs
[3:01:25] <+blademaster247> Pat would be dead without Paige and her brick of power
[3:01:25] <serra255> So Pat forgot everything aobut this game, right?
[3:01:36] <%dirtyh4rr1> Square Barrel
[3:01:38] <SMuffinMan> I hope so, Calek
[3:01:38] <Calek> 3 games are confirmed to be in development for the Control franchise, and they might finagle a way to get Alan Wake 2 in there
[3:01:38] <BritishTyrannosaur> I need to know what that alan wake dlc for control is though
[3:01:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Quantum Break was a game that never managed to get past its concept.
[3:01:58] <Reanimator83> Can’t wait for the Alan wake dlc for control
[3:01:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I could have sworn something with Alan Wake came out, was it DLC for 1?
[3:01:59] <venomfury86> i just am
[3:02:05] <+blademaster247> Does Natalia make good OJ?
[3:02:17] <%Ipsenscastle> Did anyone else watch Bright Falls? It was super good but noone talked about it
[3:02:18] <Calek> @Sphincter_Spelunker there's Alan Wake dlc coming for Control later this year
[3:02:36] <rytisone> you'll soon find blair witch
[3:02:38] <BritishTyrannosaur> AW 1 got a couple dlc's and american nightmare. all we've had for years till now
[3:02:44] <%NitronStreams> HALL WUGGIN
[3:02:44] <Calek> Alan Wake does have DLC of its own though, and a pseudo sequel
[3:02:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Not Control. I feel like I saw something for Alan Wake like DLC for that game and I kept confusing it for Alan Wake 2
[3:02:54] <%Ipsenscastle> It's honestly a really rad Alan Wake thing
[3:02:55] <%Skittlesoul> Skittlesoul subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hey big orb man! I just got my shirt in the mail today can't think of a better way to celebrate 19 months. Keep up the good work and thanks for all the fish
[3:02:57] <studleydoorite> PatHatesAt
[3:02:59] <deadredeyez> @ipsenscastle it was actually really good

[3:03:12] <+blademaster247> AngriestStaresAt
[3:03:16] <%LymanAl> If only there was some kind of map
[3:03:18] <SwindlerOfProgress> Use the mini map?
[3:03:19] <SMuffinMan> I played American Nightmare and the DLCs
[3:03:23] <%Ipsenscastle> @deadredeyez thank god i didnt just dream it haha

[3:03:36] <%Nekros4442> it's gonna be a fun Woolie podcast
[3:03:37] <%UvBenServed> To see Woolie die inside
[3:03:38] <Arek_1> What a time that was.
[3:03:38] <VJdarkworld> ninjas
[3:03:39] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie will only talk about in passing like a wet fart
[3:03:42] <%Gigagoat> it's fun to mock
[3:03:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie is back out. Forever. Until Boruto finishes
[3:03:48] <%JohnAtDawn> I;m really sick of Woolie's bitching about Naruto
[3:03:49] <%SilverDevilfish> Paige is part Moth
[3:03:50] <%Kriss1827> Podcast will be 5 hours of woolie dying on the inside
[3:03:59] <zamzoph> I thought it was funny how Woolie was avoiding talking specific Naruto spoilers last week (zombie hokages) as if anyone cares
[3:04:03] <peachy996> So normal podcast then
[3:04:04] <%NitronStreams> Clap
[3:04:08] <deadredeyez> @ipsenscastle book tvshow then the game for aalota lore

[3:05:20] <%isa_sensei96> isa_sensei96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Happy 2 Years anniversary Pat! American Govment's Stimulus check finally came through and I was thinking about starting to stream. Any recommendations for capture cards compatible with PS4 that are relatively easy to use?
[3:05:23] <venomfury86> One piece
[3:05:27] <Fujiwara_92> @peachy996 nah, ppl think woolie will go crazy on podcast about the end of naruto, he wont
[3:05:31] <%Alopekis> DESTROY THEM ALL
[3:05:42] <%a_goth_pancake> how does Barry know about Kijuju? hasn't he been retired for years?
[3:05:43] <peachy996> What's to go crazy about though?
[3:05:47] <%walternatorz> There's a suspicious lack of swearing and vodka in that "Russian" note.
[3:05:49] <%Typhaeon> She can be ur angel or ur deviljho
[3:05:51] <peachy996> I don't know or care about spoilers
[3:05:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> She can be Egoraptor?
[3:05:56] <Fujiwara_92> that's the point, nothing
[3:05:58] <%TheWinged7> @isa_sensei96 the easiest way would be to start with inbuilt PS4 streaming
[3:05:58] <+blademaster247> @Ipsenscastle I don't know. Those 11 year old girls can be pretty scary

[3:06:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> of*

[3:07:43] <+mmack093> Do you think we'll ever see Sheva, Jake or Helena will ever show up in a game again?
[3:07:52] <peachy996> I'd finally buy a new RE if Sheeva was in it
[3:07:53] <%UvBenServed> Nah
[3:07:54] <+OwlLightningMage> Dante should be the protagonist of RE9 LUL

[3:14:06] <%zyberion626> Eli teaching Pat how to art would break the 9th seal and bring about the end
[3:14:07] <%walternatorz> surely your art would match the quality of your streams

[3:24:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Nier is too convoluted to spoil
[3:24:25] <%uhdinocat> just no chat

[3:24:28] <%spiritofmojave> Actually yeah even Replicant/Gestalt
[3:24:29] <%UvBenServed> Spoiler: 2B got the booty
[3:24:29] <rytisone> not unlike TLOU2
[3:24:31] <itesket> 2b Kreygasm
[3:24:32] <%aslfrasle> I picked up Automata on day 1 and still haven't played it...
[3:24:33] <peachy996> People would rather talk about the butt
[3:24:35] <%j0ustar> beat it again. and again.
[3:24:36] <%linSP> what about dark souls
[3:24:38] <%aslfrasle> Still unspoiled too.
[3:24:40] <%optimasmaximas> lots of replayability
[3:24:43] <%Aydarkzero> doesn't that game have like 9 endings?
[3:24:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> yes I'm aware of that bit at least
[3:24:46] <%blackbaron98> yup
[3:24:46] <peachy996> the butt blocks the spoilers
[3:24:48] <BritishTyrannosaur> spoiler. big anime sfm butt
[3:24:48] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt you mean after doing ABCD and E? Or after A
[3:24:51] <T_Sasquatch> I literally could've played nier years ago before the LP but i didn't because the game looks like shit
[3:24:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Part 1 is all Matt needed
[3:24:53] <a_mad_dragon> the THIRD ending is the important one
[3:24:54] <zamzoph> Matt LUL

[3:24:59] <alliudmla> Nier Automata is so dumb
[3:25:04] <%spiritofmojave> THERE'S MORE BEYOND A
[3:25:06] <T_Sasquatch> Nier ends at A tho
[3:25:07] <%spiritofmojave> goddamn it
[3:25:09] <%Valdorick> "Hey, Game Jorunos are fucking morons and rated us down because they're dumbasses, please get ending B, at least."
[3:25:11] <AMaidIndeed> W is the true ending
[3:25:12] <%j0ustar> Finish until it's done.
[3:25:15] <%optimasmaximas> wait chat was it max or matt??? NotLikeThis
[3:25:16] <%DracaenaLeaf> I've started Drakengard 3
[3:25:16] <SummonerMagno> the huge ass distracts the conversation from going into spoilers
[3:25:19] <%baronblank> it's ridiculous to me that people stopped after A
[3:25:19] <+OwlLightningMage> it's the best ever
[3:25:21] <%SolidusRex> Max didn't?
[3:25:21] <Monkeyweed21> Is Paige the inspiration for TLOU 2's new antagonist?
[3:25:23] <CptHarlok> Didn't care for Nier. Either of them. And yes I'm familiar with the storylines.
[3:25:23] <peachy996> "Play the game more" No.
[3:25:25] <T_Sasquatch> @optimasmaximas BOTH
[3:25:26] <%TheBenson8r> EMLO
[3:25:26] <zamzoph> @DracaenaLeaf don't forget the DLC
[3:25:30] <+OwlLightningMage> There is no comparison.
[3:25:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Neir ends at A. That's pretty clever
[3:25:32] <%heartlesshealer> Ending K is my canon
[3:25:34] <peachy996> Once you see the end credits the game is done
[3:25:35] <TwinBat> he's charging up
[3:25:36] <itesket> Why play Nier Automata when there are better games out there like Undertale
[3:25:38] <%DracaenaLeaf> I'll try not to @zamzoph
[3:25:42] <%Aydarkzero> DAMN
