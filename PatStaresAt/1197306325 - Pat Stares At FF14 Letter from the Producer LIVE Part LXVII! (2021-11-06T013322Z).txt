[0:24:31] <+scynza> everyone on this screen is going to die on the moon, aren't they.
[0:24:31] <%THATGUY_789> crashing your whole car costs a lot of money
[0:24:32] <%A_Zealous_Retort> in perpetual summer land we don't get winter gas prices
[0:24:33] <%Rumbutt> but you should still get winter tires
[0:24:33] <%zaradax95> all giraffes have long limbs
[0:24:34] <%Maids4lyfe> this is just Big Snow propaganda, take some ivermectin and that'll clear the roads up

[0:24:44] <%solracc25> Is that a DMC reference? on the screen
[0:24:45] <+StryderStrikesAt> or i could cheat and get all year round tires and not have to worry about having a seperate set of tires
[0:24:45] <%Agami23> whats worse, a bunch of people peeing on a car to claim it or doing a soup kitchen?
[0:24:46] <%spitelite> small recognize small

[0:26:03] <stevenellis386> I've always wondered how they got such a high social standing in ivalice
[0:26:04] <%SpcOpsBear> FF14 factoid for the day:  Krile is 22, Tataru is 21. Estinien is 32 which means the dark and brooding Dragoon was bullied by two college students.
[0:26:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> they are LUL
[0:26:05] <$realm_forge> Short evil conformed
[0:26:05] <Ids560> they're pretty dumb

[0:26:15] <Kravus> They try to act evil, but are bad at it
[0:26:16] <Ids560> the Scholar class quest giver's ok
[0:26:16] <%Blackleafx> stupid goblin children
[0:26:18] <%A_Zealous_Retort> Years ago pat on the podcast noted that like everything bad originally came from the lalafel and I didnt realize he was straight serious
[0:26:18] <+Double_Tap_That> Like real potatoes, Lalas are poisonous unless you cook them.
[0:26:19] <anAngryHamster> They're stand-ins for children when they need more drama
[0:26:21] <%shadowsofpain> What about the Dwarves or do they not count?
[0:26:21] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> The Thaumatarges are evil looking, and they're the dumbest, most harmless dudes
[0:26:22] <%polothegreatest> michaels trumpet
[0:26:22] <%MegadBlitz> lalas are either evil or stupid?
[0:26:22] <%InternetShis> Thaumaturges and Monetarists all belong in the trash bin

[0:26:27] <Blackbeltsam> Thaumaturges are Himbos confirmed
[0:26:27] <%MegadBlitz> sounds like us

[0:31:12] <UnsteadyFunk> This is why you don't take release days off work, you idiots lol
[0:31:12] <%transporterthesequel> I mean that for Yoshi P and co GET SOME SLEEP DUDES
[0:31:14] <%Laecerelius> Hey, guess I might start playing SMTV then
[0:31:16] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA THATS A CERT DELAY
[0:31:16] <%nocturnPhoenix> That... might actually work out better for me tbh
[0:31:16] <+cascadepersona> That gives me so much more time to play SMT V.
[0:31:18] <@TheYellowcouch> Yeah I did not expect that
[0:31:19] <LilacsandFreedom> guess I'll move Endwalker Binge to Christmas break
[0:31:19] <+RealThiele> cancel all time off
[0:31:23] <sirtommygunn> lmao dont get time off for mmo launches
[0:31:27] <ape_hawk> hey guys is cyberpunk good yet?
[0:31:28] <Scuura> I can play SMTV without rushing now!
[0:31:29] <+pleblu> Maybe they dont want to totally kill their employees. Only just a little
[0:31:32] <sirtommygunn> there is always an issue on launch day
[0:31:34] <keatiestofthegribbles> COMPLIANCE FAILED
[0:31:35] <Saltmeisterr> Hmm?
[0:31:39] <+LouieRouie> More time for mogtomes I guess
[0:31:41] <keatiestofthegribbles> but thats fine
[0:31:43] <Profmcstevie> Only one finale
[0:31:47] <%ElkRiverDog> Welp, that explains why they look tired as shit.  They've probably been busting balls to get it ready
[0:31:47] <%THATGUY_789> Pat looks like he's another translator
[0:31:56] <%real_life_ghost> the Ouya version is holding it back
[0:31:57] <+Saunt> My poor friend took like a week off
[0:32:00] <@QueequegTheater> He's our rage transator
[0:32:04] <+RealThiele> pats Yoshi P's anger translator
[0:32:05] <+cascadepersona> I'm alright with waiting
[0:32:07] <%stoatacious> AAAAAAAAA
[0:32:13] <+JustToWatch> "We forgot to actually make the game"
[0:32:16] <%athuramn> @saunt same, I feel so bad for them BibleThump
[0:32:17] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> just got here, the expac is delayed!?
[0:32:19] <%solracc25> Tim Rogers syndrome
[0:32:21] <keatiestofthegribbles> brb gonna play ff 14 on the ps3
[0:32:23] <%Laecerelius> Pat is Yoshi-P's sleep translator
[0:32:24] <+CookieCutter007> C R U N C H
[0:32:27] <sirtommygunn> 2 weeks
[0:32:37] <randominternetsurfer> I really hope it had more than 3 trials.
[0:32:38] <sirtommygunn> release is now dec 7
[0:32:40] <marvel877> What I miss and why does Pat look mad?
[0:32:42] <+UltraViolet371> what's that mean
[0:32:42] <keatiestofthegribbles> pat they did
[0:32:45] <+chiazam> ENDWALKER DELAYED? good for them ig
[0:32:47] <ape_hawk> maybe yoshi should delay it by three weeks just to give himself a week of sleep
[0:32:48] <+MashinChaserR> I tabbed out what was the reason
[0:32:48] <SofterCrash> "we have content don't worry"
[0:32:50] <Macguffn> I could see a weird last second bug failing compliance
[0:32:50] <ExpressNode> He looks like he is dissolving
[0:32:53] <%solracc25> This man cannot meet Tim Rogers.
[0:32:53] <%sniffy77> welp time to change the schedule again
[0:32:54] <@QueequegTheater> @marvel877 Endwalker delay
[0:32:54] <randominternetsurfer> @marvel877 EW delayed.
[0:32:55] <CountMeowingtonn> i fucking love the christarium theme
[0:32:56] <%Logoth_> Time to change that stream schedule huh
[0:32:57] <+SolidusRex> Is the 7th early access?
[0:32:58] <keatiestofthegribbles> thats what exactly what happened
[0:33:01] <peyodogo> just two weeks, we'll live
[0:33:03] <%Ziegsy> 2 weeks aint bad
[0:33:05] <@TheYellowcouch> Yeah it must be something real minor but important
[0:33:06] <Rionxgarland> iwant  it to be the best it can be so no prob
[0:33:11] <+Saunt> 3rd
[0:33:13] <+schmonker> can we get compliance if we remove the lalafells
[0:33:14] <CountMeowingtonn> EW DELAYED TO FINALS WEEK NOOOOOO
[0:33:19] <afronooch> 3rd is early access
[0:33:19] <+chiazam> All right everyone, Thanksgiving’s shot
[0:33:20] <%nocturnPhoenix> @SolidusRex I think she said the 3rd is early access now
[0:33:22] <Kravus> Now I can enjoy Thanksgiving, all good
[0:33:22] <PunishedVenomWolf> i dont mind gives me more time to grind out shit i wanted ready before endwalker
[0:33:22] <%JoshManVGH> He's gonna say sike right?
[0:33:24] <%skizzuto> @SolidusRex I believe they said the 3rd would be early access
[0:33:27] <randominternetsurfer> @countmeowingtonn kill me.
[0:33:27] <JetVega> Guess I get an extra 2 weeks to grind
[0:33:28] <@TheYellowcouch> 2 weeks isn't that much time really
[0:33:30] <%transporterthesequel> Yo they could delay for like, six months and I wouldn't even give a SHIT.
[0:33:30] <SaltyAzteca> A fortnight delay is totally okay right?
[0:33:32] <@QueequegTheater> This fucks up my work stuff, I literally can't take off work in the beginning of a month
[0:33:33] <+RealThiele> delayed to allow players to carry lalafells around
[0:33:36] <Inparadisum> TBH gives time for all the other releases in november, the month is packed with stuff
[0:33:37] <%Agami23> someone hid inappropriate things in the expansion and now they have to remove them. like dues ex
[0:33:38] <%real_life_ghost> they're redoing all the voice lines with Chris Pratt.
[0:33:39] <keatiestofthegribbles> Aimi <3
[0:33:40] <%Monkeyweed21> delays of 1 month or almost always due to cert failure or a small handful of unshippable bugs
[0:33:40] <@QueequegTheater> Sucks
[0:33:40] <DaKnightWarrior> 2 weeks is fine
[0:33:42] <%transporterthesequel> They've won that much good will.
[0:33:45] <SofterCrash> "we're doing QA on stuff"
[0:33:55] <@TheYellowcouch> yeah honestly
[0:34:02] <keatiestofthegribbles> its prob bugs
[0:34:04] <+EySoyCoco> they delayed??
[0:34:06] <Notorious_Mic> Would this put it right on the WOW patch?
[0:34:07] <huskarl_zap> subs
[0:34:07] <Louie_Salmon> They mentioned a "personal reason" at some point?
[0:34:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> I'm ok with that. I want it to be a satisfying ending.
[0:34:09] <$valkuma> he is so fidgety omg
[0:34:11] <RocketBarrel> PAIN
[0:34:12] <@QueequegTheater> @Notorious_Mic Yes
[0:34:12] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going? anything exciting so far?
[0:34:12] <Buttku> he's japanese, pat
[0:34:13] <Zebroneath> at this point, ppl are fine with the blunt transparency
[0:34:13] <+EySoyCoco> cool actually
[0:34:15] <%InternetShis> I already got my time off approved for the week of the 19th, I doubt I'll get another in Dec
[0:34:17] <%AHomeschoolDropout> How much did I miss?
[0:34:19] <%nocturnPhoenix> Yeah things happen but I'd like to have some kind of answer too
[0:34:21] <ape_hawk> The Moon will be voiced by chris pratt
[0:34:21] <@TheYellowcouch> this feels very out of character to do a delay now
[0:34:22] <+Greywyn00> when did it get delayed to?
[0:34:23] <Kravus> 2 weeks is nothing
[0:34:24] <+DrBunni> from that I think its his perfectionism
[0:34:24] <+Catpurnicus> Yoshi P attempts to remember what sleep was like, once
[0:34:24] <theanora1> they're working hard to put NFTs in
[0:34:28] <%LeiaSkynoober> @dan_g_v delayed for 2 weeks!
[0:34:30] <Louie_Salmon> "Selfish reason" was their exact wording
[0:34:30] <%Sunriser41> @Notorious_Mic no, wow patch came out and no one cares
[0:34:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt at this stage all content is complete all thats left is bugs and possible number balancing
[0:34:31] <@Spydurman> the dude on the right looked like he fell asleep
[0:34:33] <keatiestofthegribbles> let yoshi p sleep
[0:34:34] <iosephe> ok
[0:34:35] <%transporterthesequel> guys they delayed to fix LIVING DEAD OF COURSE
[0:34:36] <%Ziegsy> @Greywyn00 dec 7th
[0:34:36] <%A_Zealous_Retort> dec7th
[0:34:37] <RocketBarrel> @greywyn00 2 weeks
[0:34:37] <+Rhaaska> sounds like they found something thats bothering him late in development, maybe the island sanctuary or something
[0:34:38] <ExpressNode> I mean if a game isn't gonna launch on time what else can you name other than bugs
[0:34:40] <+RealThiele> QA reasons
[0:34:40] <%solracc25> it's Tim Rogers syndrome.
[0:34:41] <randominternetsurfer> @theanora1 Don't make me wanna dieeeee
[0:34:45] <%Chichen> at least Savage wont be release during christmas now
[0:34:45] <+griffball13> it sounds like he found some very minor things that he wants fixed
[0:34:46] <%Ziegsy> @Greywyn00 3rd for early access
[0:34:47] <XuriScratch> "ate in to the master QA time" means bugs
[0:34:55] <huskarl_zap> also wow update comes out the same day
[0:34:56] <+UltraViolet371> they wanted to make sure sage was cooler than scholar
[0:35:02] <Solidus_113> maybe something found with the stat squish?
[0:35:03] <yomamma133713> @Kravus im sure its not nothing for those that are taking days off for the release
[0:35:04] <+Greywyn00> the 3rd is my birthday AYAYA
[0:35:08] <dan_g_v> dang wasn't expecting that
[0:35:08] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Oh thank god I'm still in Stormblood
[0:35:09] <+cascadepersona> YoshiP is a perfectionist, he wants this to release in its best form
[0:35:09] <+DrBunni> what can you fix in two weeks time?
[0:35:11] <$valkuma> they already killed scholar by just making it have nothing
[0:35:12] <+Mrbaconator> no longer releases on an IRL Full Moon + Lunar Eclipse, and an in-game Full Moon
[0:35:13] <%Sunriser41> yea, he probably found something that bugged him
[0:35:15] <%W1nterTitan> Nope.
[0:35:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Its possible they need more time to fully playtest the number squish to avoid any big problems
[0:35:15] <Kravus> Aww, the whole moon coincidence is ruined now
[0:35:18] <%walternatorz> how'd you know?
[0:35:19] <Ids560> The expansion's Hildebrand quests were too powerful
[0:35:19] <%THATGUY_789> I want it to be a hat that destroys the game
[0:35:20] <%transporterthesequel> yes, yes it is.
[0:35:20] <%InternetShis> Copium
[0:35:21] <theobble> in two weeks?
[0:35:23] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt December 3rd is when WoW gets a bunch of old content brought up by the way
[0:35:25] <BinaryShuffle> Pat is still huffing the hopium
[0:35:26] <%Piemono> DK's are gonna be lame forever now
[0:35:29] <+RealThiele> DRK -3 buttons
[0:35:31] <dan_g_v> @leiaskynoober thanks!
[0:35:31] <%Logoth_> Poor guy looks wrecked
[0:35:33] <%Birdigalore> "We delayed launch by two weeks to appease one grouchy Canadian!"
[0:35:37] <SofterCrash> "we want the best quality for your experience and want to take those 2 weeks, it may have taken longer"
[0:35:38] <%ShogunNoonto> darks knight now have 2 dicks
[0:35:38] <%MrP33Ps> he really said that it didn't meet with his own standards. what a dude. imagine having so much pull at SE
[0:35:41] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Yoshi ain't doing to good'
[0:35:45] <Macguffn> So delay, or crunch QA into the ground
[0:35:48] <UnsteadyFunk> DRK is going to be the new MNK
[0:35:48] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[0:35:48] <Kravus> They want to make sure servers don't explode
[0:35:50] <%real_life_ghost> if WoL switched to Sage instead of Paladin it would be released 4% faster.
[0:35:52] <%transporterthesequel> Oh no it BROKE
[0:35:53] <%MajorCrasher> people who call off work for video game releases astound me. I genuinely don't understand why you wouldn't just play it in your free time or request time off after it's come out since then you'll actually know if you want to devote that much time to it
[0:35:54] <$realm_forge> Wow when bungie delayed their next expansion all we got was a  “fuck you we’re taking away more story content and by the way pay us”
[0:35:58] <ammobasket> Adding suspenders slot
[0:35:59] <Cerabret100> yeah so bugs and worries over stability on launch
[0:36:00] <keatiestofthegribbles> master Q&A its def game breaking bugs
[0:36:04] <@QueequegTheater> Oh they're straight up afraid the servers won't handle it
[0:36:07] <+RealThiele> failed net test on srver load maybe
[0:36:10] <%Ziegsy> wait this means it wont be a full moon?!
[0:36:12] <XuriScratch> This apology is too long. Just say "Shit's buggy, we gotta fix it" and move on.
[0:36:14] <+Rhaaska> Or they're delaying because WoW tried to fuck them with their releases
[0:36:18] <%Sunriser41> oh ok, server issues make sense
[0:36:23] <%shurtal> no one wants another Raubahn's wall on release
[0:36:26] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah that's what it sounds like @QueequegTheater
[0:36:30] <%nanaki_ff14> @XuriScratch leave
[0:36:32] <%Phantomjay> fuck i took off of work :C
[0:36:32] <@QueequegTheater> @Rhaaska they didn't move SB or ShB for that
[0:36:33] <+pyrojack6> IT LANDS ON MY FUCKING FINALS WEEK WTF
[0:36:34] <%Chichen> Hey at least we have time for SMTV now
[0:36:36] <%MrBorisMakarov> just let him sleep rooCry
[0:36:37] <@TheYellowcouch> 100%
[0:36:39] <Astrophizz> a 2 week delay isn't going to alleviate crunch
[0:36:40] <%EternalJedi> Raubahn Extreme
[0:36:42] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> so much for Wow's FOMO play, asswipes
[0:36:47] <%Agami23> whats raubans wall?
[0:36:50] <+TEANTACLES> I've missed everything until this point, did they delay endwalker?
[0:36:52] <%InternetShis> I do, I need the hustle to get people past the chokepoint
[0:36:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @pyrojack6 rip your grades
[0:36:52] <%THATGUY_789> man I remember that stream,
[0:36:53] <TheToanon> @Chichen Yeah I'm actually happy about this cause now I have time for SMTV
[0:36:53] <@QueequegTheater> Estinien (Ultimate)
[0:36:57] <%real_life_ghost> blitzball wasn't finished
[0:36:57] <Macguffn> I'm fine with it, sometimes things just dont work out as you expect
[0:36:58] <+chiazam> EVERYONE TEXT YOUR BOSS NOW
[0:37:01] <+chiazam> NOW
[0:37:02] <%NotVeryLegendary> He looks so stressed
[0:37:02] <keatiestofthegribbles> FINALS WEEK thats a feels bad man
[0:37:03] <SofterCrash> "in these 11 years i always wanted to make the best i can, sorry for my selfishness"
[0:37:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the numbers squish probably ate up a significant amount of playtest and QA time
[0:37:07] <%Sunriser41> ok this is a good reason to delay, getting the servers ready
[0:37:08] <%transporterthesequel> Ironically this allows me to take time off WOO
[0:37:10] <%shurtal> time to RESCHEDULE SOME VACATION TIME
[0:37:14] <+RealThiele> shits important
[0:37:15] <+HollowBeansVG> I feel like they should delay it more to be safe?
[0:37:19] <SomersaultJustice> "hey boss, it turns out I moved my operation for 2 weeks"
[0:37:22] <Thepothero> Shit he feels it
[0:37:23] <%LilyaFatal> Eh I can cancel my PTO
[0:37:24] <+Rose_Silvers> I took pto
[0:37:24] <keatiestofthegribbles> DK - 4 buttons
[0:37:24] <@TheYellowcouch> ME TOO
[0:37:25] <%walternatorz> and me
[0:37:26] <%KineticZen> Yep, took the entire week off.
[0:37:27] <+Rose_Silvers> :(
[0:37:28] <%Chichen> time to redo your schedule pat
[0:37:30] <SaturnKitty> SAME HERE!
[0:37:30] <%DEETRz> i booked 2 weeks off, i am a sad man
[0:37:30] <%KineticZen> For Early Access
[0:37:31] <%Vibe__Lord> FUCK
[0:37:33] <%Mekhet09> What happens?
[0:37:34] <peyodogo> eh, you can reschedule
[0:37:34] <%Maids4lyfe> Pat you don't have PTO
[0:37:34] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Most people just dont have the time to play games after work. U frs have to take time off
[0:37:35] <@QueequegTheater> PAT YOU DON'T HAVE REAL PTO. I DO.
[0:37:35] <Louie_Salmon> Damn they have got to chill, western devs change release dates all the time
[0:37:35] <%SpcOpsBear> I AM LOW-KEY PISSED, NOW HALO INFINITE IS LAUNCHING RIGHT AFTER EW
[0:37:36] <theanora1> how do you PTO off streaming?
[0:37:37] <%A_Zealous_Retort> So how about that schedule pat?
[0:37:37] <SaturnKitty> A full week off!
[0:37:37] <%transporterthesequel> Pat aren't YOU your boss?
[0:37:38] <@TheYellowcouch> I can probably reschedule it tho
[0:37:38] <%stoatacious> hellodarness my old friend
[0:37:39] <Necnill> "They moved my grandma's funeral, boss"
[0:37:40] <afronooch> I make my own schedule. I can simply not work when I want to
[0:37:40] <%BigCoffee> You can just push back your PTo you work for yourself
[0:37:41] <+Pars_Librum> Pat...can you even take PTO? This is your job.
[0:37:41] <peyodogo> folks with bosses are fucked
[0:37:41] <+TEANTACLES> when is the new release date?
[0:37:42] <%Phantomjay> i dont even get paid i just took the day offf ugh
[0:37:42] <%nanaki_ff14> Same my vacation ends the day of release\
[0:37:43] <%RigmaroleHM> poor guy looks on the verge of tears
[0:37:44] <+cascadepersona> @TEANTACLES Endwalker delayed to Dec 7th, Early Access to Dec 3rd. Problems found in Master Q&A were deemed to large to ignore, so a delay of 2 weeks was put in place.
[0:37:44] <UnsteadyFunk> FOOLS
[0:37:45] <%MugenSandan> Not me, I don't have it ;-;
[0:37:45] <%polothegreatest> ooh boy
[0:37:47] <+StryderStrikesAt> gonna see if I can get my management to give me that time back
[0:37:49] <+miguelrod777> you dont have a boss you have to ask pat lol
[0:37:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> @Agami23 people got backed up on story due to not enough servers for a single player instance in stormblood
[0:37:51] <%solracc25> Perfectionism.
[0:37:52] <%LilyaFatal> He upset =(
[0:37:54] <hootletheowl> My 19th-23rd literally just got approved today kzxMonkaTg
[0:37:54] <ExpressNode> I don't get PTO because I'm relatively new at my job so I'm jealous
[0:37:55] <Kravus> Raids wont be on Christmas anymore thankfully
[0:37:56] <%Vibe__Lord> @TEANTACLES 3rd Dec
[0:37:57] <bob900000> yeah
[0:37:57] <Cerabret100> Its always a gamble. Thats why when I take PTO i do it fully aware it may fuck up and just play other games
[0:37:58] <%KineticZen> YEP
[0:37:59] <%THATGUY_789> part of the reason I quit my job was to play this
[0:38:01] <%ShogunNoonto> Anybody else think it's weird hes not looking at the camera
[0:38:01] <%ClericOfSparda> Dude I'm so mad I took PTO
[0:38:02] <%SveriSageAdvice> i literally have to do that now
[0:38:03] <+SolidusRex> Just call in sick folks
[0:38:04] <%InternetShis> I'm doing that now
[0:38:08] <bestwaifuritsu> ;_; Yoshi dont cry
[0:38:10] <MarylandJutsu> HOW DOES HE LOOK MORE TIRED THAN LAST TIME
[0:38:10] <%NotVeryLegendary> Well, time to go camping instead of playing EW I guess
[0:38:10] <keatiestofthegribbles> got the artwork behind them is amazing
[0:38:10] <%karovus> yep i took pto for nothing now
[0:38:12] <OmegaWeltall> bro its fine
[0:38:13] <MarylandJutsu> like sir
[0:38:14] <+RealThiele> Moon flu
[0:38:15] <ammobasket> Pat you will take real vacation and LIKE IT
[0:38:15] <+TEANTACLES> @cascadepeteraon ty!
[0:38:15] <gunstars20> LUL
[0:38:15] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Hey now for people like me who haven't finished the MSQ now have more time to finish it!
[0:38:16] <%Monkeyweed21> while trying to play the SFV beta in your hotel room
[0:38:16] <%JoshManVGH> HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING THAT WEEK!?
[0:38:19] <@TheYellowcouch> This is big blow for Yoshi
[0:38:19] <+Frampton1337> we had a vacation freeze start this week... cant put in any new ones till jan...
[0:38:19] <RocketBarrel> Can't you just say hey something happened and reschedule it? @patstaresat
[0:38:23] <+Saunt> @ShogunNoonto he is also looking at chat
[0:38:23] <%MajorCrasher> stop taking off work for games before they come out. games delay literally all the time and you don't even know if you'll enjoy the game yet most of the time.
[0:38:23] <%polothegreatest> its the shame panicBasket
[0:38:25] <%nocturnPhoenix> Yeah you can tell Yoshi's not happy to announce this
[0:38:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> i can try to see if my manager will let me push my PTO two weeks back, but it sounded pretty set lmao
[0:38:28] <%templar010> Honestly this is fine
[0:38:28] <killenbigbugs> I am not being paid for my time off :)
[0:38:28] <%ClericOfSparda> Dude Yoshi P is so upset
[0:38:28] <%Birdigalore> Someone tell Yoshida its gonna be ok :(
[0:38:29] <+healnavi> man, this sure is a long way to say "we need to do hotfixes the game is broken"

[0:39:46] <%polothegreatest> YES
[0:39:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> Lets not
[0:39:46] <%TalisKanju> Blame it on SEGA
[0:39:46] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Something with Cross Data Center transfers maybe?

[0:39:47] <keatiestofthegribbles> blame WOW Players yes
[0:39:47] <%cooldude69xx> lets do that
[0:39:48] <count_bob> It's probably due to the stat squish.
[0:39:48] <Rionxgarland> yah lets blame it on wow player
[0:39:48] <+TheRisingSpoon> I used pto for this. I'm bummed, but it's fine. I can do something else on those dates.
[0:39:49] <%NotVeryLegendary> Easily
[0:39:49] <MaraSmug> moon2D I didnt do this
[0:39:49] <Profmcstevie> Can we blame this on WoW being bad? I will anyway
[0:39:49] <Drunkengen> Yes
[0:39:49] <%croxeye> Yoshida looks like he's gonna just fall unconscious at the desk
[0:39:49] <+TEANTACLES> no because they're Ffxiv players now
[0:39:50] <%Sotetsu> Poor guy. If only those dang WoW hadn't
[0:39:50] <KnivesEve> why not
[0:39:50] <+RealThiele> YES
[0:39:50] <+SolidusRex> You can always blame WoW players
[0:39:50] <%Vibe__Lord> KILL EM
[0:39:51] <Kravus> Always :)
[0:39:52] <+J3HT> probably
[0:39:52] <RogueMinja> Maybe.
[0:39:53] <@TheYellowcouch> Let's blame BLIZZARD
[0:39:54] <+ScrapSentinel> i got denied PTO because another co worker stole the release window. i just put in for the new release window PogChamp
[0:39:54] <%RigmaroleHM> LUL
[0:39:55] <marvel877> Damn you Blizzard
[0:39:56] <championofsomeone> we could always do that
[0:39:57] <Purpleleven> No, but it'd be funny if we did
[0:39:58] <+griffball13> don't cry yoshi p
[0:39:58] <+Vilecrow> DANG IT!!! I WANTED TO FARM MY PRIVATE ISLAND!!! LOL
[0:39:59] <%AHomeschoolDropout> You can blame EVERYTHING on  WOW players
[0:39:59] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Maybe don't blame the guy whose mom just died
[0:40:01] <%blastyoboots> very Japanese for SUCH A LONG APOLOGY VIDEO AND EVERYONE LOOKING ABOUT TO CRY
[0:40:01] <CountMeowingtonn> "we deleted crafters"
[0:40:02] <%manaisstoredintheballs> absolutely
[0:40:02] <%Maids4lyfe> David Kottick did it
[0:40:02] <%SaiyanShoto> Wouldn't you blame it on blizzard for making a shitty game like WOW?
[0:40:02] <+chiazam> NO BUT LETS DONIT ANYWAY
[0:40:03] <%Monkeyweed21> reminder that WoW got 1.5 patches this year total
[0:40:03] <+PlagueRhymer> SMOrc what
[0:40:03] <%THATGUY_789> WoW to implement Fitzball
[0:40:03] <+Kyma1020> Blame it on Blizzard for making a bad game
[0:40:04] <%solracc25> yes
[0:40:05] <ttc_lover> Someone hug him
[0:40:05] <%InternetShis> Damn you belts
[0:40:06] <chimeraxmachina> Sure….why not we‘ve done it before
[0:40:08] <citerel> on the bright side i dont have to raid during christmas
[0:40:08] <bob900000> blame blizzard instead
[0:40:09] <majindusto> ALWAYS  BLAME  WOW
[0:40:09] <ink_dino> Wait, so that weird time-limited WoW event will no longer fall right on top of EW's launch, yeah?
[0:40:10] <%Puhff> If billionaire's paid their taxes, this wouldn't have happened!!!
[0:40:12] <%blastyoboots> @ScrapSentinel LUL LUL LUL
[0:40:12] <%Drspiderskull92> Blame it on Blizzard
[0:40:13] <Brandon__Brando> fuck it ya
[0:40:14] <+michingmallecho> And the momentum FF14 has been having too, this must just been a giant boulder on the devs right now and Square probably told them "don't fuck this up" I
[0:40:14] <+Vilecrow> oh yeah we can blame it on them
[0:40:18] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Asmon
[0:40:18] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt asmon gold
[0:40:18] <%Chichen> he's talking about Asmon
[0:40:19] <+TheyTookMyBeard> Fatrick lmao gottem cya loser
[0:40:22] <ExpressNode> I don't play FF14 but you know....... they could just launch the game and let you guys just be free QA. You can be part of the experience AND FIX THE GAME
[0:40:23] <+cascadepersona> @ScrapSentinel Go for it!
[0:40:24] <theobble> Yoshi pls bro..
[0:40:34] <%Blackleafx> wut
[0:40:35] <%KineticZen> Gonna see if I can reschedule my PTO
[0:40:39] <MarylandJutsu> Yoshi P....its just two weeks
[0:40:39] <huskarl_zap> blame mortal online players
[0:40:40] <The_hidden_> Yoshida: "So, I give everyone 2 free weeks subscription time!"
[0:40:43] <keatiestofthegribbles> time to kill wow players
[0:40:44] <%real_life_ghost> ERECT ALEXANDER
[0:40:44] <+textandnumbers> I mean, it's no big deal. I'll just use my PTO to play SMT5, which I probably won't have finished by then.
[0:40:48] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> lol watch Blizzard conveniently delay their 9.1.5 plans by two weeks
[0:40:51] <@QueequegTheater> You said WoW players.  I haven't slept well this week.
[0:40:52] <%stoatacious> who cares about release date GIVE ME MORE FISHING
[0:41:00] <%W1nterTitan> More time for me to do unplayed raids
[0:41:02] <randominternetsurfer> @expressnode No, you don't. Players don't want another StormBlood Launch.
[0:41:03] <@QueequegTheater> I wasn't accusing you of anything. Sorry.
[0:41:03] <SofterCrash> "we'll focus on QA, and the scheduled patches"
[0:41:04] <MarylandJutsu> two weeks is nothing compared to all the bullshit cyberpunk went thorugh
[0:41:04] <%SShen> SShen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months, currently on a 44 month streak! It is now launching on the same day as Legion timewalking
[0:41:09] <+MidnightDeacon> So whats the deal? Was it delayed or something?
[0:41:12] <+cascadepersona> @ExpressNode People pay for their subscription, this isn't how it works. Game time is money
[0:41:12] <Sarakin2> this is so melodramatic. It's cool guys. take your time. make the game good.
[0:41:14] <topiodonk> oh is he reading the chat of the stream?
[0:41:18] <@QueequegTheater> @MidnightDeacon Two weeks
[0:41:25] <%The_Protagonist> @QueequegTheater so every WoW's players mom died this week?
[0:41:27] <%athuramn> LUL ahh, the internet. have to love it
[0:41:28] <Astrophizz> as a dev, two weeks is almost no time
[0:41:34] <%solracc25> Yoshi P looks like he's about to cry from stress. It's ok man
[0:41:35] <%orochiblood> @SShen so EW has nothing to fear
[0:41:41] <ExpressNode> I was actually joking with that line but I didn't know it actually happened before
[0:41:42] <@QueequegTheater> @The_Protagonist I'm not going to defend it. My brain did a bad
[0:41:48] <InXplotch> 2 weeks is fine for finalized QA
[0:41:51] <BinaryShuffle> Tell that to cyberpunk
[0:41:52] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:41:52] <+MidnightDeacon> @QueequegTheater Gotcha. Thanks amigo
[0:41:53] <%stoatacious> legion timewalking same dat
[0:41:55] <%real_life_ghost> thinking about Hildebrandt crashes the server.
[0:41:56] <%valriot> 2 weeks isnt enough time for me to book more time off
[0:41:56] <InXplotch> yeah, that's true
[0:41:58] <%sakeydo> man it must be weird translating someone holding in what almost sounds like heartbreak.
[0:41:58] <+teh_rawk> FF15 did it
[0:41:58] <%polothegreatest> psaLiz
[0:42:02] <Profmcstevie> for them it's 8 days cos they work 4 day work weeks
[0:42:02] <+MashinChaserR> final fantasy 2077
[0:42:03] <+bigdaddypeanutbutter> I wish they just said something sooner tbh
[0:42:04] <%sniffy77> fuck it surprise launch
[0:42:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Yoshi P requires 2 weeks inside his crypt to recharge for the next 6 months
[0:42:09] <%The_Protagonist> yeah I think they should have given it a full month
[0:42:09] <%SinnerEbru> yeah you cant play it off like cyberpunk
[0:42:12] <Brandon__Brando> I'm glad there delaying it instead of saying fuck it
[0:42:12] <@TheYellowcouch> I really hope they have the problems like circled in already
[0:42:17] <randominternetsurfer> @patstaresat you can if you're Cyberpunk.
[0:42:20] <Macguffn> If they expect 1 week, and are taking 2, things would have to go REALLY bad to delay again, not impossible but DAMN if it did
[0:42:22] <nmaten> yeah but 2 weeks of crunch is like 2 months of regular work
[0:42:23] <%transporterthesequel> I'm pretty sure Yoshi P would literally DIE before another two week delay.
[0:42:24] <JetpackMcQuack> shit happens
[0:42:28] <%stoatacious> FF13 versus delayed and  that was fine!
[0:42:30] <chetasaur> wait i went for a piss did they push the expac?
[0:42:37] <%SinnerEbru> ohhhhh thatd make sense
[0:42:40] <@SpaceCapnCrone> They're probably on death march mode to make sure they absolutely don't delay again
[0:42:41] <%athuramn> I just can't imagine what they could possibly fix in 2 weeks time that doesn't require more time than that to be safe with
[0:42:42] <Astrophizz> yeah if they don't already know the problems sand have planned solutions there's no way
[0:42:42] <keatiestofthegribbles> yoshi p's eyebags has bags under the bags
[0:42:45] <MarylandJutsu> also 2 weeks is notihng compared to horrible dleays for a bunch of other games over the past few years
[0:42:47] <InXplotch> The most surprising thing to me is that they're announcing the delay SO late. It sounds like its only a couple of things they caught that need more time, otherwise they probably woulda announced it earlier
[0:42:50] <+chiazam> @bigdaddypeanutbutter I think they only JUST finally decided that they’d delay
[0:42:51] <%real_life_ghost> @chetasaur two weeks
[0:42:51] <%InternetShis> Many
[0:42:53] <%JoshManVGH> Sure does
[0:42:54] <TG_Cid11> Yoshi on watch poor guy
[0:42:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> Testing will always get you. Lost a whole 4 hours to it today
[0:43:00] <%Monkeyweed21> 99 bugs in the code, 99 bugs in the code, patch one out, 104 bugs in the code
[0:43:01] <%Nekros4442> Pat gotta schedule more goblin games
[0:43:01] <ape_hawk> TIME TO CONQUER MORE MIND GOBLINS, PAT
[0:43:03] <%Dregon_Azure> this just destroyed most of my fc's vacation times as most of em can't adjust it now x-x
[0:43:05] <archeebald1119> Well now people have more time too play smt5
[0:43:06] <%PrimalDweeb> Are you going to stream this Pat?
[0:43:06] <%NocturneNovember> Play FF4 and revive Yang since Paige didn't!
[0:43:07] <BossBoolean> @chetasaur Early access is the 3rd now
[0:43:14] <%SinnerEbru> wait are they not gonna continue work after this exp??
[0:43:16] <globalGinnicide> I just feel for the guys who took time off and cant reschedule now
[0:43:16] <%Vibe__Lord> News just in, whole company changes release date to keep up tradition that pat's schedule always gets changed
[0:43:17] <Macguffn> 2 weeks from now: "Ok, no other delays, but all Lalafel will temporarily turned into viera until the issues is fixed"
[0:43:21] <$OranHexthief> @Astrophizz if its a know issue thats just really tedious to fix. that would explain it
[0:43:22] <%PrimalDweeb> Or play on your own?
[0:43:22] <+lucidrush> Pat DOES love changing the schedule
[0:43:25] <chetasaur> okok makes sense
[0:43:26] <%transporterthesequel> Awwe you can see he notices chat and is feeling a little better
[0:43:27] <%strakillias> Just start another long RPG surely you can bang it out in those 2 weeks
[0:43:31] <%real_life_ghost> deeznutsember

[0:45:01] <marvel877> He has that kind of power, I guess.
[0:45:02] <%ElkRiverDog> Makes you wonder what he had to promise in return
[0:45:02] <%InternetShis> NOW I HAVE A WHOLE WEEK TO GRIND MY ALTS TO 80 snuffPog
[0:45:02] <%The_Protagonist> maybe they were only willing to give them the two weeks

[0:45:31] <+healnavi> is it depressing that you have to be special to not ship a buggy piece of shit?
[0:45:31] <%transporterthesequel> He is literally Square Enix now so I think he'll be fine
[0:45:31] <%JoshManVGH> Nah. They are getting drowned out by the music at times.
[0:45:32] <%tomdwarf> He might have been given some lee way, considering their performance. When your making fat stacks, ceos tend to give a bit more leeway.
[0:45:32] <%chill_o_wisp> Yoshi 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭
[0:45:33] <InXplotch> @PatStaresAt it makes you wonder WHAT the problem was. it must've been massive, or at least the fact they got so huge gave them a lot of push to be allowed to delay

[0:45:37] <%EternalJedi> FUCK OFF GUY'S LuL 2 weeks isn't a betrayal
[0:45:39] <%The_Protagonist> HELL NO IT DOESN'T BREAK OUR TRUST IN YOU, YOSHI

[0:45:54] <%Nekros4442> Nah the social link is still maxed Yoshi
[0:45:54] <+RealThiele> you make all my trust characters 80 and trust will be restored
[0:45:59] <%Evil_Emu147> Yoshida is on Square’s board of directors so he gets a lot more say than a regular producer looking to delay something.
[0:46:00] <%LilyaFatal> That Ul'dah night music isn't fair lol
[0:46:00] <sapphomet777> they have the piano going too
[0:46:01] <The_hidden_> I have been nerd betrayed

[0:46:02] <+Ironbuttz> omg this is FINE.  I get folks are dissapointed but if it makes a better end product it seems fine
[0:46:02] <%Blackleafx> We love you Yoshi P!!
[0:46:03] <TheZearGuy> I’m an old wow player and it’s shocking to see the people in charge actually care.
[0:46:04] <%polothegreatest> the highest betrayal psaWhat
[0:46:05] <+zamatermort> Man, this shit is so weird, it so much not a big deal
[0:46:07] <count_bob> The fact that they are being so honest earns my trust so much.
[0:46:07] <%ElkRiverDog> Seriously, someone hug Yoshi P
[0:46:11] <%EternalJedi> ruuKek

[0:47:11] <%A_Zealous_Retort> endwalker and the holloween event are now both going to happen real quickly in december
[0:47:12] <%Bailey__Gaming> Bungie can fuck off

[1:05:47] <keatiestofthegribbles> DEATH IS not the end but a new chapter in the journey

[1:06:04] <+Emperor_Z> I'm gonna wager that one of the twins dies, but they won't have the balls to kill their pseudo mascot, Y'shtola despite foreshadowing it
[1:06:06] <$valkuma> I'm calling it, Orangutangay is dead as fuck.
[1:06:09] <EynoStiles> I want someone to die, as hard as Aerith did in ff7.
[1:06:10] <BigLoserJosh> everyone dies, even you

[1:06:17] <Daxalog> FF14 Cataclysm
[1:06:23] <huskarl_zap> Bealsaur is the hero we need
[1:06:29] <@QueequegTheater> The game is going to kill you, the actual player
[1:06:29] <TheToanon> It's not gonna be G'raha cause they faked out him dying TWICE
[1:06:31] <+teh_rawk> this truly is the endwalker
[1:06:31] <majindusto> HUMBABA

[1:22:42] <huskarl_zap> Zodiarc is just bed of chaos again
[1:22:42] <+Stonebeard> i want lavos to be the noise
[1:22:44] <%Maids4lyfe> LAVOS IS ONE OF THE CALAMITIES CONFIRMED
[1:22:45] <knotsundownsyndrome> note that if they're willing to show zodiark, zodiark is not the final boss at all
[1:22:45] <$EsotericOdyssey> what if they remix Lavos's theme @PatStaresAt
[1:22:46] <olaksi> it's not going to be lavos, at most something inspired
[1:22:46] <%Monkeyweed21> always 6 zones
[1:22:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> WHAT ABOUT LAVOS!? woolieSHOOK
[1:22:47] <Calek> Lavos was the noise that cause the unsundered final days, calling it now
[1:22:47] <Tracazoid> If there's a Chrono raid, fuuuuuuuuccckk yessssssss.
[1:22:48] <TheToanon> Lavos is 300% Endwalker's final boss
[1:22:49] <penitentpendant> So, we'll be looking for an NPC named Chrono in that area
[1:22:49] <%BoxNavy> what if lavos is the big bad of 7.0
[1:22:50] <%MegadBlitz> walk into WoW
[1:22:50] <%NitronStreams> Somehow Lavos returned
[1:22:52] <ScrubTheNerd> I'll bet it's inside the moon
[1:22:52] <%croxeye> Have they had anything else from crono trigger in here?
[1:22:53] <+Fefe41> And then you'll smear it
[1:22:53] <CatsEyeBlind> Can't show in game because it'll spoil the massive BLITZBALL ARENA
[1:22:54] <%Agami23> the sky filled with meteors and monsters spawned from them
[1:22:54] <+Kittilot> i skip all the cutscenes in ff14 so i have no idea what anyones talking about but the maps look awrsome
[1:22:57] <+sjcodan> WHAT'S THAT POTATO DOING THERE
[1:22:57] <SolumFuturae> PogChamp Lavos
[1:23:00] <%BoxNavy> hi thancred :)
[1:23:00] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yo, what if Magus is the job trainer for Reaper?
[1:23:00] <+gustavozxd> Tataru the main protagonist
[1:23:01] <CountMeowingtonn> look its dad
[1:23:01] <%Ritei> ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
[1:23:02] <knotsundownsyndrome> something else is the final boss - and one of the dungeons doesn't at all look like anything we've seen anything
[1:23:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> A chrono raid would be DOPE
[1:23:05] <EynoStiles> half the characters are gonna die. sad
[1:23:05] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Go back to THF
[1:23:06] <%TEANTACLES> I desperately want them to reuse Eorzea in 7.0
[1:23:07] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt What if Lavos is the threat from within the planet they've been hinting at
[1:23:09] <%KineticZen> He looks like a KOF 13 character
[1:23:10] <+Wolfstriker121> he looks tired
[1:23:11] <+Ilpala> I was promised crafter/gatherer information
[1:23:12] <+other_badger> he deserves it

The ancient Greeks associated it with the death and the underworld, believing there was a meadow of asphodel in Elysian Fields, and considered it sacred to Persephone, goddess of the spring and queen of the underworld.

[2:22:16] <%kainhighwind1990> Hey Pat, I'm thinking about changing mains in EW - if I wanted to go full Guts, do you think Warrior would be better for angry smash or DRK for big sword?
[2:22:17] <+Ironbuttz> GW2 Heals?
[2:22:17] <+Solutha> but healers are basically unkillable
[2:22:22] <denastes> just give everyone a gun

[2:26:06] <Daniel_Is_I> So it's king of the hill?
[2:26:07] <+dmbender> is this payload?
[2:26:08] <%tusk102> is this just paragon
[2:26:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> SO ITS BLITZBALL BUT WITH LESS DROWNING

[2:26:39] <%cvp5127> this is why it was delayed LUL
[2:26:39] <%W1nterTitan> oh it's 5cp
[2:26:39] <+teh_rawk> tower control actually
[2:26:40] <+Das_Prints> So it’s payload tug of war.

[2:26:47] <Srthunda> oh so like paladins
[2:26:47] <%polothegreatest> Payload
[2:26:47] <%transporterthesequel> Payload WORKS
[2:26:48] <%AncelDeLambert> I would have prefered a MOBA
[2:26:49] <%Kaask> overwatch 2 push mode, where you push the release date back
[2:26:49] <+preppyposs> CONGA CONGA CONGA
[2:26:49] <+PMAvers> No, it's not Payload. It's Tower Control from Splatoon.
[2:26:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> DO WE HAVE SPY
[2:26:52] <%polothegreatest> doodSad
[2:26:58] <%AncelDeLambert> moba would have been better, in total honesty

[2:27:18] <BackflipCharm> They tried MOBA with Rival Wings and it died. LUL
[2:27:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> THAT MEDIC IS A SPY
[2:27:31] <TaurusTeal> So capture the flag
[2:27:37] <%valriot> They stole WoWs players, now they're after Overwatch players

[2:28:33] <@QueequegTheater> 3 hour matches let's goooooo
[2:28:34] <$Doctor_Piranha> Will it at least give ok xp though?
[2:28:35] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:28:36] <aln1yat> yeah 15+ min for a 5v5 is too much
[2:28:36] <%TaifuDragon> So no, it's gonna be short

[2:28:56] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> why is mustafar in FFXIV?
[2:28:58] <+dolphinbj> Current matches are like 10-15 minutes
[2:29:00] <%TaifuDragon> It'll be 5-10 most likely
[2:29:03] <+PMAvers> Since it's Tower Control, it'll probably have a match timer, and the tie breaker will be whatever team pushed farther into the enemy team's territory wins.
[2:29:05] <CountMeowingtonn> is this a blitzball map
[2:29:10] <%valriot> Tekken Stage LUL

[2:35:56] <%SWFanatic> mastery pass
[2:35:57] <$OranHexthief> a free season pass basically @PatStaresAt
[2:35:59] <%Monkeyweed21> you're dead like Bruce Willis in 6th sense
[2:35:59] <%tusk102> @OneThousandTomatoes it happened to all of twitch not just pat
[2:35:59] <%transporterthesequel> GET THOSE FORTNITE BUCKS
[2:36:00] <Purpleleven> Oh good, 2 periods to miss rewards from
[2:36:01] <%Garthunox> you havent played it
[2:36:02] <+cascadepersona> OH GOD, I JUST REALIZED I CAN ACTUALLY PLAY THE KOF XV BETA
[2:36:02] <+zajoestar> Battle pass
[2:36:02] <JojoPiero> Seasons are shorter, Series replaces Season old duration
[2:36:03] <+Talimity> TOO MANY QUEUES
[2:36:09] <haisho> one major season then mini-seasons I'm guessing
[2:36:14] <@TheYellowcouch> I love these devs. They suck at explaining things sdjsadsjada
[2:36:15] <%tusk102> FUCKING BR SEASONS?
[2:36:17] <%BoxNavy> that shit look like the battle pass
[2:36:18] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis all it had to be was Blitzball
[2:36:18] <%cvp5127> come on battle pass
[2:36:20] <+RealThiele> boo overhaul
[2:36:20] <Mattais88> different maps?
[2:36:21] <%sw_paladin> WoW classic pvp
[2:36:23] <%The_Protagonist> this is a lot of PVP talk
[2:36:23] <%transporterthesequel> shut up it's fine probably
[2:36:24] <%AncelDeLambert> the game or the stream?
[2:36:25] <+Talimity> diluting the tiny pvp playerbase too much
[2:36:26] <%Dregon_Azure> just burn down pvp x-x
[2:36:28] <%Garthunox> Just let me buy my clears
[2:36:35] <DeadEyeArrow> ff14 can't just make shit straight forward
[2:36:43] <%transporterthesequel> maybe kinda at least I don't need a spreadsheet to PvP anymore.
[2:36:44] <%InternetShis> Let it at least be more expensive after the fact, but don't lock it to a few hundred people
[2:36:47] <+RealThiele> yea this will speed up pvp queues LUL
[2:36:51] <+xemnahort> Imagine having good pvp. One can dream
[2:36:53] <@QueequegTheater> NO, YOU HAVE TO EARN THEM
[2:36:54] <%BoxNavy> honestly. just add a new mode and new wolf marks shit.
[2:36:54] <%Dregon_Azure> FOMO to force you to always play it x-x
[2:36:55] <%SWFanatic> big time sink
[2:37:02] <CrowbarFacelift> Why's it gotta be like this
[2:37:02] <akareynolds88> This seems like a waste of dev time
[2:37:05] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't know if I could make a functional PVP system in FF14 but I bet I could make something more exciting than this
[2:37:10] <+xemnahort> I’d legit pay cash to get all pvp gear so I can never touch it again
[2:37:12] <+Greywyn00> nice of them to revamp pvp for the WOW refugees
[2:37:16] <@QueequegTheater> LITERALLY JUST GIVE US BLITZBALL
[2:37:16] <Macguffn> i think they just saw the wall of complaints about he season rewards
[2:37:24] <+preppyposs> people play PvP
[2:37:27] <%polothegreatest> Its payloaad+ranked+bp
[2:37:32] <%Garthunox> good thing its optional then
[2:37:36] <ViewtifulBeck> BLEETZBAWL viewti14Tataru
[2:37:38] <+RealThiele> just merge the reward table for all pvp cowards
[2:37:38] <+Mman1414> Just give us griftball
[2:37:40] <%tusk102> WE JUST WANT BLITZBALL
[2:37:42] <%transporterthesequel> Blitzball is unlocked for top 100 pvp.
[2:37:43] <Purpleleven> At this point, the pvp mounts are about at the same level as the mogstation-only mounts
[2:37:50] <%tusk102> WHERE IS MY BLEETZBOL
[2:37:50] <+Rhaaska> a bunch of the wow people who are coming over want pvp so they can at least make the attempt i guess
[2:37:52] <+SeventhVice> Trade pvp for one extra dungeon each patch
[2:37:56] <Xelhesia> is paige ok?
[2:37:56] <%BoxNavy> bleetzboll
[2:37:57] <%stoatacious> WAH
[2:37:59] <afronooch> ye
[2:37:59] <joshujostar> i just woke up did square enix do the usual? did they delay again?
[2:38:02] <%BigCoffee> Only 100 jackoffs on every data center will get the rewards
[2:38:05] <%Chichen> its a battlepass lmao
[2:38:12] <+xemnahort> @transporterthesequel get the squad together we must win for the bleetzball
[2:38:15] <%The_Protagonist> yeah we still haven't gotten confirmation on blitzball right?
[2:38:15] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:38:17] <%Dapper_Cactuar> why do they keep adding steps to get decent rewards rather than just adding decent rewards to the wolf mark shop
[2:38:18] <%TEANTACLES> 6.18??
[2:38:19] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Knock knock
[2:38:19] <%chill_o_wisp> it's a battle pass?
[2:38:22] <%BoxNavy> yeah

[2:38:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> uhhh
[2:38:26] <ClarentMordred> trade pvp for hildibrand quests
[2:38:30] <%tusk102> you only get blitzball if you parse top 1% in every savage and extreme @PatStaresAt

[2:38:37] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[2:38:38] <%Lefanque> who let nomura start numbering patches
[2:38:45] <%Chichen> Because theres no fucking roulette
[2:38:45] <+preppyposs> BATTLE PASS
[2:38:47] <+RealThiele> oof that series ui
[2:38:50] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I’m fairly new to the game so I guess I don’t understand this aggressive apathy people have against PvP?
[2:38:51] <aln1yat> this is the worst letter from the producer ever
[2:38:52] <%Garthunox> Pat you're insane
[2:38:53] <+PMAvers> Hopefully they'll rework the roulettes so Rival Wings fires more.
[2:38:54] <Zeif00> battle pass
[2:38:56] <GilliamYaeger> @ClarentMordred More like trade pvp for FUNCTIONAL DRK AND SCH
[2:38:56] <joshujostar> rival wings is alive when irregular tomestones are up
[2:38:57] <KnivesEve> any news on hildabrand quests?
[2:38:57] <isolex_> OH MY GOD IT'S JUST A BATTLEPAS
[2:38:58] <+xemnahort> @tusk102 only if it’s with blm
[2:38:59] <%tusk102> @Lefanque ff14 intergrade RE:vengeance
[2:39:00] <%Garthunox> People q for it a LOT!
[2:39:00] <@TheYellowcouch> Can't just call it a battle pass huh
[2:39:02] <+PMAvers> Or maybe Frontline will get chucked into the sea.
[2:39:02] <%Dregon_Azure> no fomo please x-x
[2:39:03] <Calamity2007> I want to vomit looking at this
[2:39:03] <%InternetShis> Fucking kill me
[2:39:03] <PageofHeart> Battle Pass lmao
[2:39:04] <Finakala> There's been .58 patches for ages honestly
[2:39:06] <%stoatacious> this live letter has actually lowered my hype
[2:39:06] <citerel> rival wings is like only queued when moogle tomes are up
[2:39:08] <%A_Zealous_Retort> patches go 6.0, 6.1, 6.15, 6.18, 6.19, 6.19 1/2, etc
[2:39:10] <%Sunriser41> look at this battlepass
[2:39:11] <%DEETRz> rival wings is honestly really fun
[2:39:13] <GilliamYaeger> It's a fucking battle pass.
[2:39:14] <%transporterthesequel> Yes it is just a battle pass.
[2:39:15] <%polothegreatest> This is FF14 Endgame
[2:39:17] <T_Sasquatch> just show us the armor or no one is playing it
[2:39:18] <%stoatacious> this sucks
[2:39:18] <%Lefanque> Rival wings is very fun
[2:39:19] <+Wolfstriker121> It’s battle pass
[2:39:22] <Kiyoske> battle pass
[2:39:22] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> RW is fun, just no one fucking plays it cus it isnt in the ruellete
[2:39:25] <haisho> unless tomestones are involved, yes
[2:39:31] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> is this FOMO because I thought YoshiP was against FOMO
[2:39:33] <fistynopunches> the problem is pvp sucks
[2:39:34] <$StrawberryPantsu> This is just a battle pass
[2:39:34] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You can drive an Opressor in RW
[2:39:36] <%tusk102> @A_Zealous_Retort 6.30 birth by sleep
[2:39:36] <xxshadowxx416> this a battle pass
[2:39:36] <zetanidura> rival wings is definitely the best mode
[2:39:37] <+RealThiele> mounts on the pass oh no
[2:39:38] <+cascadepersona> THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATTLEPASS
[2:39:43] <stote44> it's not a battlepass it's a fantasypass
[2:39:46] <T_Sasquatch> is rival wings fun if theres no fucking tutorial for it
[2:39:49] <@QueequegTheater> THAT'S JUST A BATTLEPASS
[2:39:53] <%stoatacious> christ fuck this
[2:39:53] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I'm so sick of battlepasses being shoved into everything and being ran into the ground
[2:39:54] <%bear_breaker20> unless they announced an overhaul to pvp itself this is just boring and annoying
[2:39:54] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a thought, yeah, PVP should count to raising the job level, otherwise why bother
[2:39:55] <+xemnahort> I’d jump thru any hoop to get blitzball
[2:39:55] <+Greywyn00> player v pass
[2:39:56] <%tusk102> thats a fucking battlepass
[2:39:58] <+Axellogic> Congrats you made the FOMO worse
[2:40:07] <%tomdwarf> Im still only gonna do it for xp, and ignore it otherwise
[2:40:08] <Mortal_Wombat_I> The only issue I had with Battlepasses in the past was that you had to pay for the “real” version
[2:40:12] <%stoatacious> I can't believe they ruined endwalker hype
[2:40:20] <Midboss87> psaBougie
[2:40:22] <joshujostar> pretty sure everyone at any point of their life has played dota so you get rival wings
[2:40:24] <+xemnahort> @anceldelambert I mean pvp does give exp so yeah it does
[2:40:28] <Calamity2007> FOMO Mind Goblin strengthened
[2:40:34] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the problem is wolf marks are mainly useless since outside of the base rewards you can get super fast there's nothing to spend them on
[2:40:36] <%transporterthesequel> Yoshi P is a Ultima child man, there's gotta be LOSERS FOR THERE TO BE WINNERS
[2:40:37] <%zyberion626> at least pvp is totally divorced from the rest of the game
[2:40:37] <@TheYellowcouch> I hope that it kinda works like the Halo MCC "battle pass" where you an cash in points on specific rewards from all series
[2:40:41] <%BoxNavy> why dont they add like a slightly shittier looking version of all the feast rewards in the wolf mark shop
[2:40:49] <+dolphinbj> Fixed
[2:40:50] <@QueequegTheater> But that's not a problem? The whole point is that they're super special. Feast armor is even more of a dick swing than TEA weapons
[2:40:51] <%tusk102> i would literally give a leg for blitzball (not actually but still)
[2:40:53] <JojoPiero> None of this affects people who don't want to play it tho, how is this killing your EW boners, grow up
[2:40:55] <%The_Protagonist> oh.. so there's no "top 100 players" reward or anything then it's just "play a lot to get stuff"
[2:41:00] <%Dapper_Cactuar> GIVE US STUFF TO SPEND WOLF MARKS ON
[2:41:01] <+Like51bears> there you go pat
[2:41:02] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I was not hyped for the PvP lol I'm still excited
[2:41:05] <fistynopunches> still time limited vanishing rewards
[2:41:06] <Purpleleven> Oh wait, that's good
[2:41:08] <+MidnightDeacon> Thats better than nothing
[2:41:10] <%tusk102> @BoxNavy all the same but the metal is slightly less shiny
[2:41:11] <General_Terro> win traders killed
[2:41:11] <Onamar> This is replacing Feast rewards
[2:41:12] <%TEANTACLES> why don't they just tie the rewards to like, a pvp-battlepass
[2:41:12] <$StrawberryPantsu> This is JUST a battle pass
[2:41:14] <DeadEyeArrow> This has been in development for a while
[2:41:19] <%AncelDeLambert> @xemnahort that's good. I was assuming from how Pat was talking that it was a complete waste of time
[2:41:20] <%stoatacious> the top 100 is so fucking awful
[2:41:21] <%Ziegsy> I kinda wanna play it, but I feel like its gonna be like khloe
[2:41:22] <olaksi> @zyberion626 that's kind of the issue though, you have to set up and learn completely separate hotbars so people just don't bother getting into it
[2:41:22] <+xemnahort> @tusk102 give a literal leg no one said it had to be yours Haha2020
[2:41:24] <%valriot> they actually didn't say feast rewards, only titles ect
[2:41:25] <%transporterthesequel> Keep in mind, PvP basically didn't exist so like, yeah battlepass whatever sure.
[2:41:29] <%Garthunox> Get good at pvp then
[2:41:32] <Purpleleven> I mean, its still season-locked, but its not win-trading
[2:41:32] <+2hutown> @The_Protagonist Its both.
[2:41:39] <%The_Protagonist> oh lol
[2:41:47] <VioletRosefall> so its a Battle Pass
[2:41:49] <+RealThiele> trade for old season stuff if so is ok
[2:41:50] <%Garthunox> FOMO PREVENTION!
[2:41:53] <+Tarviti> Top 100 likely won't have mounts tho
[2:41:53] <$StrawberryPantsu> Isn't alot of PvP just win Trading?
[2:41:53] <%transporterthesequel> Oh they are doing the token thing pat just mentioned
[2:41:54] <@TheYellowcouch> come oooon
[2:41:54] <%The_Protagonist> thepro95Emil thepro95Emil thepro95Emil
[2:41:54] <%tusk102> @xemnahort hand your leg over then
[2:41:57] <%SWFanatic> that was what wow did when i stopped
[2:42:03] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[2:42:04] <@TheYellowcouch> GOOD?
[2:42:05] <+preppyposs> EEEEEEEEY
[2:42:05] <hootletheowl> Some servers have fucking a huge group of guys who do nothing but PvP at the beginning so they can get a bunch of quick queues and just don’t pvp for the rest of the season so no one can possibly catch up, and that’s like a group of like 50 people
[2:42:07] <@QueequegTheater> I still don't get the issue with top-100 rewards?
[2:42:08] <%EternalJedi> FOMO solved
[2:42:08] <%InternetShis> Make it like Halo MCC
[2:42:12] <%tusk102> OH?
[2:42:12] <T_Sasquatch> @JojoPiero because instead of just a daily to get wolf marks, this actually forces engagement with the horrendousness of pvp
[2:42:16] <@TheYellowcouch> GOOD
[2:42:20] <%tusk102> PLEASE
[2:42:24] <+xemnahort> @anceldelambert I mean it really is it plays terribly, has no balance at all, and a bunch of rewards are feast only which isn’t always available
[2:42:25] <@TheYellowcouch> GOOD
[2:42:30] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[2:42:33] <%tusk102> they carry over
[2:42:33] <%Garthunox> kinda defeats the point of feast rewards then
[2:42:34] <GilliamYaeger> FOMO SLAIN
[2:42:38] <%transporterthesequel> good yes I'm here for this.
[2:42:42] <@TheYellowcouch> I bet the first rewards will be old feast armours
[2:42:44] <+xemnahort> @anceldelambert some of the regular wolf mark gear is pretty good tho
[2:42:44] <olaksi> OK that's good
[2:42:44] <WadeWestSSG> Garo armor pls
[2:42:45] <%The_Protagonist> did Paige break her face?
[2:42:53] <%Chichen> NO ITS MINE
[2:42:57] <+RealThiele> ok goblin slayed
[2:42:57] <%Monkeyweed21> NEVER
[2:42:58] <%EternalJedi> boom gottem
[2:43:00] <%Garthunox> No
[2:43:02] <Macguffn> if the season/series rewards are 'free' and then get dumped into a token 'buy' system then that could work
[2:43:03] <Xelhesia> so like poetics?
[2:43:03] <%tusk102> HMMMMM
[2:43:04] <%Chichen> LUL
[2:43:08] <%Chichen> I HAVE NONE BUT ITS MINE
[2:43:09] <haisho> YESS
[2:43:09] <%Mendin> @The_Protagonist face schmace, did paige break another door
[2:43:10] <%Phantomjay> i feel like its too nice
[2:43:12] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That would defeat the entire point of Feast rewards.  You SHOULDN'T be allowed to get them
[2:43:13] <Srthunda> same
[2:43:14] <%Phantomjay> theres no way
[2:43:14] <%Monkeyweed21> IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN
[2:43:16] <%BoxNavy> i want the damn mounts
[2:43:24] <+Ur3an> They said they would never give the feast rewards in another way
[2:43:26] <+preppyposs> @PatStaresAt did you usffer through feast pvp to earn that armor like they did though?
[2:43:26] <+dolphinbj> You’ll never get shadow stalker pat
[2:43:28] <@QueequegTheater> NO
[2:43:30] <%BigCoffee> @QueequegTheater yeah bu feast is for losers
[2:43:32] <%polothegreatest> LUL doodCrazy
[2:43:35] <%BigCoffee> Feast is the worst
[2:43:36] <@QueequegTheater> YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE IT.
[2:43:37] <%BigCoffee> delete feast
[2:43:41] <GilliamYaeger> @QueequegTheater That's a good thing, not a bad thing.
[2:43:41] <+xemnahort> @boxnavy we will never get those mounts
[2:43:50] <haisho> it's not gonna happen :(
[2:43:51] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt ok Pat you can have feast armor... if you place high enough in the next Feast season GOTTEM
[2:44:00] <%Dregon_Azure> FOMO is dead woo
[2:44:00] <%kainhighwind1990> You think we're gonna get Hildebrand in EW?
[2:44:03] <+preppyposs> GOTTEM
[2:44:03] <@QueequegTheater> Just get good at Feast
[2:44:05] <$JGardner03> You want feast rewards you gotta suffer with feast lol
[2:44:16] <+RealThiele> Hildebrand gets launched into the moon
[2:44:19] <@TheYellowcouch> Wolf tokens
[2:44:25] <@commanderclaw> Here I thought MMOs were supposed to be meritocracies, git gud
[2:44:26] <%zyberion626> phew, FOMO has no place in XIV
[2:44:27] <RocketBarrel> PLEASE ADD OLD FEAST ARMOR
[2:44:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Just win trade like most people
[2:44:35] <%Ziegsy> getting good at the pvp isnt and issue, its finding players. Queue times are HORRID
[2:44:36] <olaksi> You have to care way too much about PVP (and still have to deal with win traders) to be rewarded for doing it, tokens seem like a good change
[2:44:40] <%Dregon_Azure> if i have to Feast suffer then I want to suffer for a month, not every single season of it lol
[2:44:40] <nevan_44> the only feast we participate in is thanksgiving god bless
[2:44:45] <RocketBarrel> NO IT ISNT
[2:45:02] <%The_Protagonist> oh
[2:45:07] <@TheYellowcouch> That's very good
[2:45:08] <+RealThiele> so maybe series gear will include older feast shit later
[2:45:13] <%The_Protagonist> so it is just PVP in general, okay
[2:45:31] <%The_Protagonist> so if you have one PVP mode you like you can just hang there, that's fine
[2:45:33] <%A_Zealous_Retort> feast shit but they change a pixel so its not the same
[2:45:35] <%tomdwarf> Why does Feast suck? My assumption is that it's queue times, win trading, and no reward unless your top 100.
[2:45:50] <+xemnahort> FOMO = Feast armOr Makes Oversuffering
[2:45:50] <thecrazyestminer> True
[2:46:01] <%Dapper_Cactuar> @tomdwarf that combined with rampant cheating
[2:46:02] <@TheYellowcouch> I really think the system they have for regular wolf marks works just fine they just need to make pvp faster and funner
[2:46:06] <NemokillerV> I remember using old feast gear in the benchmark so they're probably gonna make it available.
[2:46:08] <%The_Protagonist> i'm sorry what
[2:46:10] <%VHGS> @tomdwarf it's just not a very good format
[2:46:11] <+PMAvers> Feast gear is brought back. Monkey's paw finger curls: but all the armor looks like it's covered in your own poo.
[2:46:14] <%tusk102> @xemnahort feast armOR makes orbsuffer
[2:46:18] <Purpleleven> @tomdwarf You get a few things if not Top 100, but basically yes
[2:46:22] <%BoxNavy> do you get anything if you score under top 100 in the feat
[2:46:27] <%BoxNavy> feast
[2:46:34] <+xemnahort> @tusk102 I’m glad you understand
[2:46:38] <Kiyoske> feet
[2:46:45] <%BoxNavy> feet
[2:46:46] <%Garthunox> PAT IT WONT HAPPEN
[2:46:46] <GuyNamedGatsby> @tomdwarf The feast sucks because only 1% of all pvp players get the good gear from the feast.
[2:46:47] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> psaDogchamp
[2:46:52] <+xemnahort> Feet yes sbfpYeyeye
[2:46:53] <%transporterthesequel> First season has GOTTA be old shit.
[2:46:56] <%bassforte123> You get special stuff if you're top 100, but there's a wide selection of stuff if you just collect tokens casually
[2:46:59] <GilliamYaeger> @BoxNavy You get tokens to buy the permanent weapons, but not the armor or the mount.
[2:46:59] <%transporterthesequel> In the token store
[2:47:00] <+atteroproxy> It's not happening dude
[2:47:10] <%transporterthesequel> It wouldn't make any sense if it wasn't.
[2:47:12] <+RealThiele> like old wow battlemaster tokens
[2:47:17] <%28moogles> They said top 100 stuff is titles and shit
[2:47:19] <@QueequegTheater> BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. WHY WOULD THEY EVER DO THAT?
[2:47:23] <peyodogo> its never coming back man
[2:47:30] <+Dwarven_Gaming> top 100 is titles
[2:47:30] <@QueequegTheater> Top 100 gear is literally a status symbol
[2:47:31] <%Dapper_Cactuar> they really need to add more wolf mark shop stuff
[2:47:39] <Goobbue> are these those Non Fungible Tokens?
[2:47:40] <+RealThiele> ok streamer
[2:47:45] <%BoxNavy> and me
[2:47:48] <%ShogunNoonto> fuck that shit
[2:47:49] <T_Sasquatch> yea a status symbol of win trading losers
[2:47:51] <+zamatermort> No Pat
[2:47:54] <Kravus> Strummer?
[2:47:55] <@TheYellowcouch> Forfeit all feast armours to Pat
[2:47:56] <Rionxgarland> too bad
[2:47:56] <PageofHeart> Status symbol and proof of jank rankings
[2:48:00] <Daniel_Is_I> Yes it's me I'm the critics saying fuck off PVP
[2:48:01] <+RandyFistburgers> It would cost them nothing
[2:48:01] <PageofHeart> no decay
[2:48:01] <%polothegreatest> Pay the toll doodCrazy
[2:48:02] <%transporterthesequel> Pat is top 100 in his heart
[2:48:03] <%The_Protagonist> wait they're talking about people shitting on PVP right now
[2:48:05] <%ShogunNoonto> i like you pat but no

[2:48:22] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt TBH I'd be more excited about being able to get the old stuff than I'd be upset about losing the exclusivity of my set
[2:48:24] <%DashXero> Why does Pat want Chichen's armor so bad?
[2:48:24] <+Axellogic> You can have mine I dont sub anymore anyway :V
[2:48:35] <%The_Protagonist> "people in chat are saying harsh things about why do we even need a PVP"
[2:48:37] <%Ziegsy> what armor does pat want? most of them are wank

[2:48:56] <karl_rex> I wish they would make the armor available to make all the win traders doing feast mad
[2:48:59] <Nupinoop296> brownSLEEP
[2:49:02] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt which armor do you want?
[2:49:08] <+dolphinbj> @Ziegsy shadowstalker is pretty poggers
[2:49:09] <Calek> "guys pvp is fun really, we worked super hard on it, please play it"
[2:49:09] <%xemnahort> Give chichen’s armor to everyone
[2:49:12] <%BoxNavy> more like pvpenis
[2:49:13] <%Chichen> Shadowcleaver
[2:49:14] <olaksi> oh nooo 50 people playing will be super upset about their peepees if other people get their hyper exclusive armor
[2:49:18] <%TEANTACLES> i wonder if we'll get more deep dungeons or exploration zones ever again...
[2:49:19] <+preppyposs> @PatStaresAt you have a month Pat get grinding
[2:49:22] <+RealThiele> and the furrr
[2:49:23] <%sw_paladin> Im glad the feast gear doesn't fit my tastes, so i dont have to give a damn about feast.
[2:49:24] <%transporterthesequel> yeah the last one was rad
[2:49:24] <%The_Protagonist> honestly I really like the Nue armor for my dancer, basically just looks like a Yakuza tattoo down the back of the coat
[2:49:26] <Midboss87> I have never touched the pvp in my entire 14 career.
[2:49:27] <%transporterthesequel> Like, SUPER rad
[2:49:34] <%Ziegsy> the stuff you need collars for?
[2:49:35] <bbbbuttts1> are you gonna switch to paladin
[2:49:35] <%transporterthesequel> STUPID rad, actually
[2:49:43] <+zamatermort> The boots with the fuurrrr??????
[2:49:43] <%Chichen> MAHJONG TIME
[2:49:47] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the cape and the fur? what about the reeboks with the straps?
[2:49:48] <%Chichen> MAHJONG TOP 100
[2:49:49] <%polothegreatest> Ff14 doesnt have fortnite influencer code LUL
[2:49:49] <+dolphinbj> just make the special big dick armor glow a little or give it a pattern
[2:49:49] <@commanderclaw> Hmm, almost like MMOs are a meritocracy
[2:49:50] <%CalderGaming> pat is malding over this armor
[2:49:51] <%xemnahort> @calek no just delete it and give us all the rewards Yoshi-P:dies
[2:49:52] <Nupinoop296> i wish they had a separate stream for PVP info
[2:49:54] <%The_Protagonist> they should put some PVP gear in the Moogle Treasure Trove
[2:49:56] <+2hutown> I don't mind grinding, but Feast is miserable...
[2:49:58] <fistynopunches> what if you had to play 100 arena matches in dark souls to get artorias' armor? thatd be awful

[2:51:35] <%BoxNavy> savage STINKS!
[2:51:39] <TheToanon> Here's my take: Savage raids shouldn't have cool shit happen in them so people that don't want to do them get to see the cool shit
[2:51:44] <%Nekros4442> Just let us get the previous feast shit somehow.
[2:51:44] <karl_rex> Enjoy? I'm sure they're all win traders

[2:56:54] <@TheYellowcouch> Healer dps
[2:56:55] <%TEANTACLES> As a DRG main: What's a healer?
[2:56:58] <denastes> they gotta get that sick dungeon parse man
[2:57:01] <AllenDeadman> Glare spam their way to a wipe
[2:57:01] <%transporterthesequel> No it's fine by the time stun wears off everything is dead
[2:57:01] <%SWFanatic> if you need healing to tank then you don't deserve it
[2:57:03] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt If I want to change my main in EW and go full Guts, should I be Warrior for ANGRY SMASH or DRK for the big sword?
[2:57:04] <%transporterthesequel> no worries.

[2:57:20] <+RealThiele> GAMER PROFILE
[2:57:20] <%tomdwarf> Ill admit, Ive pulled groups as healer to the tank. It tends to be when there only pulling one group at a time.
[2:57:32] <%PrimalDweeb> Healers didn't adjust huh? Shame.
[2:57:33] <@TheYellowcouch> Selene is the Healer I'm the DPS
[2:57:34] <haisho> I'm dreading leveling my Paladin and Warrior because Bardam's Mettle
[2:57:38] <%BoxNavy> lets see paul allens calling card
[2:57:38] <%vVAstrAVv> thats that sch copium lol
[2:57:53] <scrambledxeggz> It's really too bad healers dont know how to heal their butt hurt
[2:57:56] <olaksi> @tomdwarf I mean when you can easily tank the next group yourself even if the tank refuses to do their job, yeah
[2:57:58] <%Agami23> i know some people who will make a erp card using this for sure
[2:58:05] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I had a tank in one run of Shisui who did a wall to wall then never used mitigation and only used an offensive ability once every 15 seconds and then blamed everyone else when he died or lost aggro
[2:58:05] <Purpleleven> Now that I think about it, might be a bit more open to pulling as a healer now that Glare cast-time is down
[2:58:07] <%xemnahort> @haisho oof

[3:01:02] <%Dapper_Cactuar> @xemnahort he said since it worked the previous runs he did it was all of our fault. We weren't able to kick him due to one of the DPS not wanting to rock the boat, and then after we barely beat the first boss despite him ignoring mechanics and almost causing multiple wipes the tank ragequit

[3:19:29] <$EsotericOdyssey> to breath underwater
[3:19:29] <%darklordfodder> There's a quest that explains it.
[3:19:29] <chaos2frozen> don't worry about it
[3:19:31] <%Toynota10> its an ability you get in Stormblood expansion
[3:19:32] <$EsotericOdyssey> it is a story point

[3:20:26] <Amperture> @scrambledxeggz A turtle asks you to go to a bottom of a lake to retrieve a thing. You tell him you can't breathe underwater so he casts a "breathe underwater" spell on you.
[3:20:26] <%xemnahort> Urianger should make a pilgrimage there to solve his ‘problem’
[3:20:28] <%SWFanatic> "I can't take out the trash now mom, I'm spearfishing!"

[3:20:30] <+other_badger> thancred can't actually breathe underwater but he's such a chad that he swims with you anyway
[3:20:50] <olaksi> @scrambledxeggz yeh, they're bros
[3:20:51] <%InternetShis> Scions forget Alisaie, Lyse, and a psychopath can breathe underwater
[3:20:51] <%sw_paladin> A ninja turtle put a spell on us
[3:21:05] <+atteroproxy> @scrambledxeggz Yeah there's a ninja turtle war too
[3:21:11] <%TEANTACLES> is this wrapping up any time soon?
[3:21:24] <scrambledxeggz> This game gets cooler every time I hear about it.
[3:21:25] <Ausk> I hope they add this to the saucer

[3:21:45] <%xemnahort> @teantacles if they talk about combat classes not a chance

[3:23:46] <+Greywyn00> damn now the 1-60 grind isn't just free LUL
[3:23:46] <%Agami23> increasing the price for aetheryte travel while also decreasing the amount you get from leves is rough
[3:23:47] <+Talimity> PAT D:
[3:23:47] <+preppyposs> Pat stares at Inflation
[3:23:50] <tukds> Pat doesn't even want to play the game just optimize his account.
[3:23:52] <%The_Protagonist> wait so they're going to make people have to spend more gil and then TAKE AWAY gil rewards?
[3:23:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt Ol bezos /j
[3:23:53] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> on one hand this sucks on the other I think they dont want people to use leves to speedrun leveling

[3:23:54] <+cascadepersona> START SELLING NOW
[3:23:56] <AllenDeadman> pat no
[3:23:59] <xxshadowxx416> Gil does not matter
[3:24:00] <%SWFanatic> Patrickuh
[3:24:04] <+RealThiele> yea all this is gonna do is keep new players poor
[3:24:05] <+Medrex> i'd like to know if there was that many people abusing leves. It's a pretty dull grind even with the decent payoff
[3:24:05] <CzeekyTV> stuff on the market board isn't even expensive, who cares about inflation
[3:24:08] <scrambledxeggz> Pat Bezos
[3:24:11] <+Wolfstriker121> Start selling now!!
[3:24:12] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> player release valve
[3:24:13] <penitentpendant> @preppyposs I mean, he's seen other fetishes before
[3:24:19] <%Garthunox> Pat hates inflation, if you wanna find out more just google sonic inflation
[3:24:23] <%AHomeschoolDropout> BUY THE DIPS
[3:24:25] <T_Sasquatch> Say what you want, grinding Leves takes a fucking long time
[3:24:27] <+LouieRouie> No wage only spend
[3:24:29] <%Ynkubus_> Battle leves being made useful?
[3:24:31] <%The_Protagonist> @xxshadowxx416 considering they're making it more expensive to teleport everywhere, gil's GOING to matter
[3:24:36] <+cascadepersona> YOU HAVE THE NEXT MONTH TO CRAFT
[3:24:43] <+RealThiele> leves dont take long when you run bots
[3:24:46] <xxshadowxx416> oh no
[3:24:49] <%Mathochism> luckybunOwo
[3:24:49] <%SWFanatic> oh no
[3:24:49] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[3:24:52] <AllenDeadman> mmmm
[3:24:57] <AllenDeadman> nah
[3:24:57] <ViewtifulBeck> Sonic inflation? viewti14Tataru
[3:25:08] <%Agami23> wasent that about some dude who printed fake money wwith sonic on it and didnt get caught for a while?
[3:25:12] <%SWFanatic> gotta inflate fast
[3:25:13] <%darklordfodder> Sonic inflation sounds like a trap.
[3:25:17] <faldin> I heard about laws against inflation, google rule 34 inflation to find out more
[3:25:22] <SinisterBroccoli> What music is playing atm?
[3:25:26] <+JustToWatch> cozy this is your chance
[3:25:36] <%DeadStage> Sonic Inflation was a big part of the economy, people who don't know about it should definitely look it up for an interesting read
[3:25:38] <%Mekhet09> This will not fix the economy.
[3:25:39] <%Mathochism> azym steppe
[3:25:43] <Solidus_113> I think this is the Steppe theme
[3:25:44] <aln1yat> @SinisterBroccoli azim steppe i think
[3:25:45] <JojoPiero> @SinisterBroccoli Azim Steppe day theme
[3:25:49] <%Mekhet09> This will just make it so that people have less money.
[3:25:49] <FishSkeleton> I am happy they're improving the expansion's stability, but I took a week off for release and can't move the dates so I'm really sad right now
[3:25:50] <%darklordfodder> @faldin That's pretty much what I assumed Sonic Inflation was.
[3:25:50] <+SolidusRex> INFLATION? YOU HAVE THE POWER OF GOD AT YOUR FINGERTIPS AND YOU CHOOSE TO WATCH INFLATION? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! - Cranky Kong
[3:25:51] <%SWFanatic> Cozy: "Thats lukewarm"
[3:25:56] <SinisterBroccoli> ty <3
[3:26:00] <%nanaki_ff14> Pat I googled Sonic Inflation, but its all just porn... I dont get it
[3:26:00] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> flying ball with wings rouge will save us
[3:26:04] <%PrimalDweeb> Why even have an in game economy?
[3:26:08] <+Greywyn00> Haruki Shota is famous for his role in japanese economic inflation, just google Shota Inflation
[3:26:08] <+Das_Prints> Rip coffee biscuits.

[3:26:16] <@QueequegTheater> COFFEE BISCUITS NOOOOO
[3:26:20] <%nanaki_ff14> :)
[3:26:22] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, started playing 14 about two months ago after seeing Peach's stream and I just beat Shadowbringers two days ago.  Thanks for shilling this game for so long boss, it's fantastic.
[3:26:23] <%Mekhet09> The market board isn't going to fix itsel, how the hell are they going to stop the market board inflation unless they regulate the prices themselves?
[3:26:25] <%nanaki_ff14> lol
[3:26:32] <+preppyposs> @swizznatch gottem
[3:26:37] <%darklordfodder> Just raise interest rates.
[3:26:44] <%darklordfodder> You know, on all the in game loans.
[3:26:50] <%InternetShis> Well I got a week off work to grind, time to bust out the pre order earings
[3:27:01] <+UltraViolet371> a big ol break before island sanctuary?
[3:27:05] <%AHomeschoolDropout> The Non-Corporeal Hand of the Gil Market strikes again.
[3:27:12] <iosephe> gotta keep them inflation rates low, stable and predictable
[3:27:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> 10 minute break I think
[3:27:14] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:27:18] <+RealThiele> 15!
[3:27:31] <Amperture> @darklordfodder you say that as a joke, but the market board does charge a tax per transaction, they could bump that up
[3:27:38] <%Mekhet09> you moved back down.
[3:27:40] <+LouieRouie> Are you?
[3:27:41] <%Wallabri> you... you mean down there?
[3:27:44] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt
[3:27:46] <@TheYellowcouch> I LOVE THIS SONG
[3:27:46] <osaka_daioh> that works fine!
[3:27:50] <%BoxNavy> wonder what else theyre gonna talk about
[3:27:50] <%Laecerelius> Pat go down
[3:27:53] <%tusk102> emet why are you he ere
[3:27:55] <%darklordfodder> Bumping that up sounds better than raising TP costs.
[3:27:59] <Snowplex> its cool that emet is narrating...idk why i find it cool but its cool
[3:28:02] <haisho> this proves Pat is indeed short
[3:28:06] <Xelhesia> YUP
[3:28:07] <%Faustgesicht> So coffee biscuits dead?
[3:28:07] <osaka_daioh> This is a BIG one
[3:28:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> yup
[3:28:10] <+RealThiele> emet is a token now, hes token emet!
[3:28:11] <%BoxNavy> so does shadowbringers
[3:28:13] <@TheYellowcouch> Shadowbringers did too
[3:28:13] <Nupinoop296> they all do though don't they?
[3:28:16] <%SWFanatic> dat potato would be good in a stew
[3:28:16] <stevenellis386> time to get some tea
[3:28:16] <+wotko92> Emet sounds lighter.
[3:28:16] <$StrawberryPantsu> So did ShB
[3:28:17] <%NocturneNovember> @tusk102 because you remembered him
[3:28:17] <FishSkeleton> Shadowbringers did too.  The main theme and Tomorrow and Tomorrow
[3:28:19] <+Greywyn00> BIG expansion
[3:28:19] <%Garthunox> just likw ShB
[3:28:19] <%Ziegsy> @TheYellowcouch about to cry again
[3:28:20] <%zyberion626> this is going to be the credits theme and I'm going to be sobbing during them
[3:28:20] <+atteroproxy> The more leimotifs the better
[3:28:24] <%BoxNavy> actually all of the expansions do
[3:28:24] <%BloodyBurney> they usually do, this seems like it has 3?
[3:28:25] <%tusk102> @Snowplex his voice is good
[3:28:27] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> The theme in the cg trailer is "Endwalker -Footfalls-" supposedly
[3:28:28] <Xelhesia> gonna have two story arcs
[3:28:29] <peyodogo> don't all expacs have two themes? heavensward had the title heavensward and dragonsong
[3:28:29] <joshujostar> emet overstaying his welcome
[3:28:29] <%Agami23> i assume one is for hydalyn and one is for the moon
[3:28:30] <%The_Protagonist> Heavensward had HW and Dragonsong
[3:28:37] <+cascadepersona> That might just be up for you, Pat
[3:28:41] <+Rhaaska> I really like that Emet is our narrator now
[3:28:43] <some_brave_apollo> still using the same ship model?
[3:28:43] <@TheYellowcouch> @Ziegsy WE CRYYYYY
[3:28:46] <chaos2frozen> I really want the full version for the Old Sharlyan(sp?) theme
[3:28:47] <%darklordfodder> I still need to finish Shadowbringers story. Why am I even here?
[3:28:47] <Vermillion129> Emet narrator?
[3:28:47] <scrambledxeggz> *Hears the word Akatsuki**furiously slaps hands together to sexy jutsu my way through my problems*
[3:28:49] <penitentpendant> Was that Lucia?
[3:28:54] <%tusk102> im still so curious as to what happens after 6.0
[3:28:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> my babies rooCry
[3:28:57] <FishSkeleton> I think Stormblood did too, the main theme everyone thinks of and then the credits music that's like a army anthem
[3:29:00] <Midboss87> Emet Selch still watching over us
[3:29:09] <%jyeowa> shadowbringers actually kinda broke that 2 leitmotif rule with shadowbringers + tmrrw and tmrrw PLUS eternal wind actually

[3:31:51] <%The_Protagonist> so Alphinaud and two others are dying
[3:31:56] <%LilyaFatal> Yo, you know what happened near the end of FF4? The Sage character cast a big spell to try to kill the main villain and died
[3:31:59] <dmtjinni> LUL
[3:32:00] <Midboss87> I wish Aplhinaud would stop red flagging
[3:32:01] <RaidenRising> he is ded
[3:32:03] <%Arweynn> alphanooo
[3:32:06] <%darklordfodder> Somebody is probably going to die.
[3:32:08] <%crimsonharvest> If they're doing some shit like in FF4 expect lots of "deaths"
[3:32:08] <@TheYellowcouch> That just means they'll live tbh
[3:32:10] <%valriot> Yshtolas 4th death let's go
[3:32:10] <%DashXero> Are there really no character deaths in FFXIV?
[3:32:12] <FishSkeleton> What, Pat, you won't believe it when Y'shtola dies for the 17th time?
[3:32:12] <Snowplex> hate that the last part feels like FF15 cirSlain
[3:32:13] <Nupinoop296> if Alphinaud dies we're gonna have to tell Dulia-Chai. i wouldn't be able to handle that
[3:32:14] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:32:15] <butthurtdave> RIP RYNE
[3:32:16] <+other_badger> Pog

[3:32:20] <Srthunda> ya, the character deaths should be sudden and a surprise
[3:32:21] <Purpleleven> @LilyaFatal NO, BAD
[3:32:23] <olaksi> i mean alphie would be the most appropriate character death
[3:32:25] <joshujostar> it's over?
[3:32:26] <+trackles_64> lady of the denim
[3:32:27] <%PrimalDweeb> And she's back.

[3:32:42] <%LittleCinders> @patstaresat Where is page on MSQ?
[3:32:44] <+ekodrop> did pat get punched in the cheek or something....
[3:32:44] <%zyberion626> @DashXero absolutely not. hell a character death is one of the iconic moments of the game
[3:32:44] <%crimsonharvest> in 4 the deaths were sudden and surprising but except for one, fake
[3:32:44] <%Ziegsy> Shes a Jaige?
[3:32:45] <%DashXero> @chaos2frozen Ah.
[3:32:47] <scrambledxeggz> They love edging the emotional death
[3:32:47] <%LittleCinders> Paige*
[3:32:50] <@TheYellowcouch> OH I CAN GET MCDONALDS BREAKFAST NOW
[3:32:53] <penitentpendant> @olaksi Alisae wanted her character development
[3:32:55] <%Arweynn> is it time to bother elmo for his birthday yet
[3:32:55] <+RealThiele> paige doesnt wanna leave the pat
[3:32:55] <DeadEyeArrow> they had time to render the trailer with the new date
[3:33:09] <%DashXero> @zyberion626 Got it.

[3:33:19] <@QueequegTheater> SourPls
[3:33:21] <olaksi> @penitentpendant and her's always came from having to take over from alphinaud so
[3:33:23] <chaos2frozen> @DashXero that's what makes it a threat, we know they have done it before lol, especially with popular characters lol
[3:33:25] <ExpressNode> I'm having a great night too play so AI the somnium file
[3:33:29] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck Eureka
[3:33:29] <@TheYellowcouch> Good for them!
[3:33:29] <mikesapartment> modern eureka is great but during sb...
[3:33:33] <@TheYellowcouch> Eureka is pain
[3:33:35] <+RealThiele> Eureka is bad
[3:33:36] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:33:37] <blue8moon> people have wildly varying opinions on Eureka
[3:33:37] <%crimsonharvest> Yeah thats FF11
[3:33:38] <@QueequegTheater> Eureka is just like Classic WoW or FF11
[3:33:39] <%The_Protagonist> get good tho
[3:33:41] <ninnokabin> Get good Pat
[3:33:43] <CzeekyTV> Eureka is popping now idk why you were alone
[3:33:43] <some_brave_apollo> bring friends
[3:33:43] <afronooch> Eureka sucks.  Especially after doing Bozja before it
[3:33:47] <%DashXero> @chaos2frozen That makes sense.
[3:33:49] <RocketBarrel> what you doing hunting NMs by yourself?
[3:33:50] <%Dregon_Azure> eureka isn't so bad, just gotta join trains
[3:33:52] <+SolidusRex> LFG dude
[3:33:52] <Tooniearcade> Eureka kmaNyoom
[3:33:53] <Ids560> Eureka was kind of mind numbing
[3:33:56] <%bassforte123> I did modern eureka, it's a massive pain any time you're not close to the level cap of the area because your movement is so limited
[3:33:56] <+Tarviti> Since they said it's story important for Endwalker it's always packed now
[3:33:58] <%sw_paladin> sw_paladin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! glad to see you join the highlander club, we the best.
[3:33:58] <%croxeye> there's tons of ppl doing eureka on primal tho?
[3:34:01] <%BoxNavy> NOOOOO
[3:34:01] <akareynolds88> on content it was great, bozja was so boring compared
[3:34:02] <%The_Protagonist> oh god no
[3:34:03] <Snowplex> RUN NOW
[3:34:03] <Vermillion129> you have to play eureka during primetime or it kinda sucks
[3:34:03] <@TheYellowcouch> Eureka is just grind on one mob until someone who knows what they're doing tells you waht to actually kill
[3:34:04] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Eureka is good. Solo Eureka is a nightmare
[3:34:05] <%Theo_Marks> oh NO
[3:34:05] <%W1nterTitan> NOoooooo

[3:44:42] <%ShogunNoonto> So Max says he got early access to Elden ring He just can't stream it
[3:44:51] <+Ricky_Nuggets> It would be funny if the translator has never played the game.
[3:44:52] <Solidus_113> I saw a Machinist in Dalradia that had like 560k HP, it was sick

[3:45:51] <zetanidura> mid-level exp reset?

[3:45:54] <%BubbaRands> Did you press the start button at least?
[3:46:02] <+alternative_flu> I've played a bit of Dark souls and Sekiro is the only FromSoftware game I've beaten
[3:46:09] <+trackles_64> Can yo ushare the code with us?
[3:46:10] <%JhinBappo> Chat, stop prying.
[3:46:11] <+Ricky_Nuggets> Blink in the next 10 minutes if you like Elden Ring!
[3:46:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> Breaking news streamer says that he can't say elden ring is fun
[3:46:14] <%PatNTheHat> Told my buddy about Elden Ring, he said Martin should get back to writing the books and lost his shit when I said we'd gone 2 years without an update
[3:46:16] <+tempestzephyr> oh, is that why he was strangely silent on twitter today
[3:46:16] <%The_Protagonist> hotter2Nervous
[3:46:18] <%BoxNavy> february :)
[3:46:19] <CzeekyTV> aww this mid-level exp reset is a bit disappointing
[3:46:21] <penitentpendant> "It exists." Pursuer rises behind Pat's couch.
[3:46:21] <+NoriBasket> give me the elden ring :(
[3:46:23] <%PrimalDweeb> Which means, not now.
[3:46:26] <T_Sasquatch> @jhinbappo he can stop replying
[3:46:27] <+trackles_64> share the code please
[3:46:27] <olaksi> Hah, don't have them all at 80? eat it scrubs
[3:46:27] <%SWFanatic> If you were woolie and he didn't sign an NDA what would he say
[3:46:29] <%Ziegsy> right, its gone 5 am. Im tappin out. NIGHT GUYS <3
[3:46:35] <@TheYellowcouch> Laughs in all jobs at 80
[3:46:37] <+Greywyn00> better hit the next level everyone
[3:46:37] <FishSkeleton> When does Elden Ring come out?  I don't have a PS5 and I figure it runs bad on launch PS4s like mine so I haven't kept up.
[3:46:41] <Srthunda> makes sense
[3:46:41] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Can you give a facial expression about what you would hypothetically think of Elden Ring
[3:46:42] <Lynxystem> i woulda thought we would have at least have had to wait until the network test beta for people to start getting review copies, huh
[3:46:45] <penitentpendant> @Ziegsy Have good sleep
[3:46:48] <2Sam4Hall> Get fucked everyone who isn't full 80
[3:46:49] <%Fenrirlives> @patstaresat if you decide to stream the full game on release. I will def be there!
[3:46:51] <@QueequegTheater> GET TO 80, FUCKERS
[3:46:51] <%The_Protagonist> oh shit
[3:46:54] <afronooch> i cant believe yoship is stealing my exp :(
[3:46:55] <MaybeFalco> well that kinda sucks
[3:46:56] <iosephe> that's weird but ok
[3:46:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's super weird.
[3:47:01] <%The_Protagonist> so basically everyone get to your next level at least lol
[3:47:03] <T_Sasquatch> Wait what
[3:47:05] <+NoriBasket> I just bought 300 normal quality coffee biscuits :(
[3:47:06] <zetanidura> oh gotta not let my reseted exp go to waste
[3:47:11] <Ks201> so wait does that mean if you get xp at lvl 55 or something itll start you at the start of 55?
[3:47:11] <%Dapper_Cactuar> can't lost half a level if every combat job, crafter, and gatherer besides fisher and blue mage are at max level psaDab
[3:47:11] <BarnYardFiddler> @fishskeleton It was made for the older generation
[3:47:13] <%Aeoneth> Thank god I hit Omni 80 on everything
[3:47:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> but its cause the xp calcs are changing
[3:47:19] <Nupinoop296> oh
[3:47:22] <Srthunda> or stop plating a class that has no exp
[3:47:22] <%Ziegsy> @QueequegTheater ILL LEVEL DRK WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER
[3:47:36] <xxshadowxx416> 3 weeks
[3:47:39] <@QueequegTheater> @Ziegsy You'll never get your amaro with that attitude
[3:47:43] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:47:45] <penitentpendant> @Ziegsy So December 3rd then
[3:47:46] <+other_badger> bleepbloop
[3:47:47] <+trackles_64> lol
[3:47:52] <ohno778> gorillion numbers
[3:47:53] <%SWFanatic> its fine
[3:47:53] <DeadEyeArrow> Overwriting a database sounds like shit can go really wrong
[3:47:53] <Dr_Mooose> the void
[3:47:56] <%HairballCT> oops
[3:47:57] <+trackles_64> windows 11?
[3:47:58] <%The_Protagonist> well luckily stream didn't die haha
[3:47:58] <%nanaki_ff14> scuffed
[3:48:02] <%Arweynn> OhnoBS
[3:48:07] <%Ziegsy> @QueequegTheater I have the baby minion one. thats good enough
[3:48:08] <afronooch> bles u
[3:48:09] <%SWFanatic> blessu
[3:48:15] <+ekodrop> WHERE'S THE ROOSTER?
[3:48:19] <%PatNTheHat> Biggest man with biggest sneezes
[3:48:20] <Shin_goob> good thing i already got my three mains to 80 lol
[3:48:20] <+cascadepersona> 10 billion
[3:48:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> the downscaling probably put a lot of pressure on the qa team so thats with the unexpected wave of new players is probably the reason for the delay
[3:48:24] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Have you seen the cool-ass 2042 game mode, Portal?
[3:48:30] <olaksi> @DeadEyeArrow Not really, but it can be incredibly cumbersome when there's a ton of entities
[3:48:43] <%Agami23> i wonder if we'll ever learn what the deal with that shoebill is
[3:48:47] <%nanaki_ff14> Hey Pat what if OBS pulled an Adobe Photoshop
[3:49:05] <%nanaki_ff14> Rise of Dark OBS
[3:49:09] <+trackles_64> seems like a lo tof work
[3:49:17] <%BoxNavy> dont worry. they will
[3:49:22] <@TheYellowcouch> omg
[3:49:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> this is all bafflegab, unless their databases are really badly coded they could have changed it without having to do all the stuff they're saying they have to.
[3:49:28] <penitentpendant> You log in, every class is level 79
[3:49:37] <%nanaki_ff14> everyone level 79 at expansion release lol
[3:49:38] <%A_Zealous_Retort> all your lvl 80 characters are now 79 with 1xp to 80
[3:49:40] <penitentpendant> Hrk
[3:49:41] <@TheYellowcouch> that gave me the big anxiety just now
[3:49:42] <%Ritei> spaghetti code
[3:49:42] <+Greywyn00> imagine being 99% of the way to 71 and losing it all LUL
[3:49:42] <FishSkeleton> So tired of this shit after twice in WoW
[3:49:44] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> watch it reset Everything to lv1
[3:49:47] <%zyberion626> @rumtumtugnutz something something spaghetti code
[3:49:47] <%VHGS> @rumtumtugnutz are you familiar with the history of final fantasy fourteen?
[3:49:48] <nevan_44> monkaS
[3:49:49] <seaechiowai> Yoshi-P will laugh gloriously
[3:49:51] <+trackles_64> why not just give exp boosts to everyone?
[3:49:58] <+trackles_64> lol lost exp
[3:49:59] <+the22cstomp> @rumtumtugnutz they are badly coded lmfao this is well known
[3:50:01] <+RealThiele> you got exp, heres a free level token
[3:50:13] <%BoxNavy> phew good thing i leveled summoner
[3:50:15] <penitentpendant> @DavidCrimsonHeidern Mandatory New Game Plus
[3:50:20] <%nanaki_ff14> @trackles_64 he explained it why they cant
[3:50:22] <%PatNTheHat> Then fuck you
[3:50:26] <+other_badger> then ya KEEP GOING
[3:50:30] <%Dregon_Azure> then level again
[3:50:32] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> KEKW
[3:50:34] <T_Sasquatch> im pretty sure not everyone would watch the live letter or know about it so... this is super important info that the game needs to put on login
[3:50:34] <@TheYellowcouch> Get to 80 in 4 weeks losers
[3:50:34] <%xemnahort> @boxnavy same based
[3:50:43] <%zyberion626> just get to level cap or be content in losing some exp
[3:50:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> but they can still sell you boosts!
[3:50:53] <+trackles_64> all i know about FF14 is that  one  guy ate eggs for a week
[3:51:03] <+RealThiele> yea setting someones level still doable
[3:51:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> they can't just code an item that gives you a level.
[3:51:15] <%nanaki_ff14> Rich?
[3:51:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> but they can sell you one!
[3:51:22] <FishSkeleton> lots of apologism in this one, kind of obnoxious
[3:51:26] <olaksi> @rumtumtugnutz billion rows shouldn't be that infeasible yeah, wonder how they have it set up
[3:51:41] <seaechiowai> I have to confess, I don't even play this game I'm just here for parasocial exp
[3:51:46] <CzeekyTV> square should hire the armchair devs in chat
[3:51:46] <artoflec> i think it was eggs for one extra long stream
[3:51:46] <+trackles_64> Eatshit no lofers and start again from 0
[3:51:48] <@QueequegTheater> I would like to thank all the Feast players losing their exclusivity for beta-testing PvP for Yoshi
[3:52:00] <artoflec> he could only eat eggs irl too
[3:52:07] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:52:07] <olaksi> @CzeekyTV yeah no one here has ever worked with databases
[3:52:08] <%Chichen> I did it and im also happy its dead
[3:52:17] <PageofHeart> Feast dying is the best news ive heard all day
[3:52:18] <%TaifuDragon> Feast was good reeeeeeeeeeee
[3:52:18] <faldin> is feast dead dead or are they tweaking it and bringing it back?
[3:52:19] <+RealThiele> thats a lot fo entries
[3:52:24] <penitentpendant> @trackles_64 "But new players start at level 1?" "DID I STUTTER!?"
[3:52:27] <%DeadStage> Yoshida killing the feast win-traders and the clear sellers is hilariously great
[3:52:30] <%PatNTheHat> Cuz they're doing other stuff during the delay? And that's why they're delaying?
[3:52:31] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:52:31] <+Greywyn00> feast is dead, long live pvp
[3:52:36] <%Chichen> I killed feast.
[3:52:40] <%nanaki_ff14> Feast lovers also defend Lyse
[3:52:47] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:52:53] <+trackles_64> Cant kill chaos
[3:52:54] <PageofHeart> now we all can be cool guys with the feast armor
[3:52:56] <ohno778> I wish Lyse didn't suck
[3:53:08] <%nanaki_ff14> Same I semi like her lol
[3:53:14] <+Greywyn00> we all wish Lyse didn't suck
[3:53:16] <PageofHeart> hopefully this means THIS DATA guy's chair from Ala Mhigo gets added too
[3:53:20] <%nanaki_ff14> mainly the outfit is dope as hell
[3:53:23] <+RealThiele> "its only a liuttle bit of lost exp"
[3:53:27] <%BoxNavy> i wonder how feast-doers are holding up right now
[3:53:28] <AMask777> three weeks seems generous
[3:53:29] <%DeadStage> I wish Lyse would suck
[3:53:39] <+trackles_64> No pressure
[3:53:44] <%BoxNavy> no
[3:53:47] <%Chichen> already done.
[3:53:48] <@QueequegTheater> BUT CAP THEM THO
[3:53:50] <haisho> too late I'm doing it already
[3:53:50] <Lagzlot> Shutting down the game for 3 weeks or going on Mr Baelsar's Wild Ride for an hour? Gee, I wonder which is more time efficient.
[3:53:51] <+trackles_64> Defeat the mind goblins pat
[3:53:54] <%SWFanatic> Reverse Psychology engaged
[3:53:55] <%Dregon_Azure> get that amuro!
[3:53:56] <penitentpendant> @BoxNavy "At last... we're free..."
[3:53:56] <Nupinoop296> so glad i'm already completely at cap on my main
[3:53:56] <+RealThiele> but if your close though. . .
[3:53:58] <%kainhighwind1990> can we just get Fordola to replace Lyse in the story
[3:53:59] <@QueequegTheater> CAP YOUR RETAINERS TOO
[3:54:03] <%NitronStreams> grind yourself into dust
[3:54:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt what about BLU tho
[3:54:05] <%polothegreatest> doodMash doodMash
[3:54:07] <%bassforte123> Is the Lyse problem just the only interesting part of the Ala Migo story being Ferdola?
[3:54:10] <Ids560> I can't wait for 10 more levels of Blue Mage
[3:54:26] <%BoxNavy> pat get the malboro mount
[3:54:26] <@QueequegTheater> BLU is easy to cap
[3:54:28] <+Rofiarf> as someone that doesn't play mmos much, is it really a big deal?
[3:54:29] <+trackles_64> woof
[3:54:30] <%BubbaRands> You should've had them all capped last week! WHY AREN'T THEY CAPPED?!
[3:54:30] <@TheYellowcouch> Good I was gonna do trusts this weekend
[3:54:34] <@QueequegTheater> I just don't have a friend to do it with
[3:54:42] <%ShogunNoonto> Give me a free boost potion For my old class I just didn't level This expansion
[3:54:44] <%BoxNavy> YEEEEEAH
[3:54:45] <Srthunda> ferdola seems to be popular within the community, which is wierd considering shes extremely lame
[3:54:48] <+RealThiele> Ala Mhigo story being disjointed and everyone from there being the absolute worst didnt help
[3:54:52] <%A_Zealous_Retort> ... is 1000 needles going to not do 1000 damage anymore or is it about to get BUSTED once squish happens
[3:54:55] <%Agami23> just level blu solo. there are guides
[3:54:57] <%PatNTheHat> Wait, you guys have characters at cap?
[3:55:07] <@TheYellowcouch> Someone come to famfrit and and boost my blu
[3:55:09] <T_Sasquatch> @srthunda femdom
[3:55:12] <Tennochief> my ass hurts
[3:55:13] <+trackles_64> Gib food
[3:55:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @bassforte123 Lyse just sorta stumbles into being the protagonist of Stormblood despite not doing anything and acknowledging that she doesn't deserve it
[3:55:14] <+Greywyn00> 100 needles Kappa
[3:55:16] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[3:55:26] <%sw_paladin> Chikken
[3:55:28] <Midboss87> blu is so easy to boost
[3:55:29] <+trackles_64> Gib food father hungry
[3:55:31] <%BubbaRands> MY LOVIN
[3:55:31] <@QueequegTheater> @Agami23 By far the fastest way is to go to Kholusia with a second player in the party who is at 80 and killing mobs
[3:55:34] <+trackles_64> Chimken
[3:55:35] <+other_badger> @Rofiarf it's potentially a big loss of time if you have a lot of high-paritally-leveled classes but not a huge deal for most people
[3:55:36] <%SaiyanShoto> He doesn't know that
[3:55:37] <%HairballCT> LUL
[3:55:37] <%bassforte123> @Monkeyweed21 Also true
[3:55:38] <Tennochief> @theyellowcouch if I wasn't working on WHM, I would.

[3:58:52] <FishSkeleton> I wasn't going to level Paladin just to bandwagon for Endwalker but now I will if I can be Cecil outright
[3:58:52] <penitentpendant> @QueequegTheater Would that make him... A Lala-con?

[3:59:05] <Purpleleven> GOTTA COLLECT MORE ROCKS
[3:59:10] <Tennochief> GIVE US YANG
[3:59:14] <@TheYellowcouch> Collect phone
[3:59:15] <%Mendin> @artoflec Welcome to FFXIV
[3:59:25] <+RealThiele> man those Allagans had Tomestones for every occasion
[3:59:37] <FishSkeleton> SHOW FEM HROTHGAR COWARDS
[3:59:40] <@TheYellowcouch> Aphorism trash, got it
[3:59:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Tomestones of your daily horoscope
[3:59:44] <DekaJack_> I wonder if Kaine's outfit is the DRG one
[3:59:56] <%DeadStage> Poetry forever
[3:59:59] <CzeekyTV> the game will shut down before poetics are ever removed
[4:00:04] <@TheYellowcouch> No maiming seems to just get a version Cecils armour
[4:00:05] <joshujostar> wasn't the cecil one maiming?
[4:00:06] <%Monkeyweed21> poetics 4 life
[4:00:06] <penitentpendant> @FishSkeleton Dim hope: They might introduce their character model the same way viera were introduced
[4:00:07] <Purpleleven> So Poetics are becoming Aphorisms, or am I misreading this
[4:00:10] <farrellcityking> Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark
[4:00:16] <olaksi> maybe another tier of tomestone gear adds the missing ones
[4:00:16] <@QueequegTheater> bark
[4:00:20] <ohno778> bork
[4:00:23] <DekaJack_> Well thats depresso
[4:00:25] <+RealThiele> Tomestones of Da Moon
[4:00:28] <+other_badger> no poetics are always poetics
[4:00:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> @Purpleleven no
[4:00:29] <haisho> Poetics will be Poetics.
[4:00:32] <olaksi> but glam has failed me before
[4:00:42] <@QueequegTheater> @Purpleleven Aphorism is the level 90 uncapped currency
[4:00:43] <Solidus_113> Poetics will always remain as the legacy basic tome that always gets used for older gear
[4:00:45] <FishSkeleton> @penitentpendant That's what I'm waiting for
[4:00:46] <%Wolfamily4> Did Pat make an En Vogue reference???
[4:00:47] <Amperture> @Purpleleven Poetics are staying, Allegory and Revelation are getting replaced
[4:00:49] <RushUnplugged> @Purpleleven poetics always stay as the basic currency, then there's the main new currency and the timegated one
[4:00:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> @Purpleleven poetics are staying and you cant exchange them
[4:00:52] <%Mendin> Tomestones of Eternity, surely
[4:00:52] <@TheYellowcouch> Poetics are good
[4:01:03] <Purpleleven> Ah, that makes sense
[4:01:06] <FishSkeleton> Show Kain Highwind armor for DRG
[4:01:08] <+RealThiele> one day they will make Glamour less of a pain to do
[4:01:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> I'm ok with poetics staying
[4:01:15] <@TheYellowcouch> WE HAVE NO BELTS
[4:01:18] <Tennochief> I just want my transmog items
[4:01:19] <JetVega> We won't have belts
[4:01:25] <%kainhighwind1990> SHOW KAIN ARMOR
[4:01:29] <joshujostar> heavensward artifact for drg is basically kain's
[4:01:29] <artoflec> there is 200% going to be kain armor for DRG there's no way they wouldn't.
[4:01:30] <%Monkeyweed21> enjoying being Paladin Cecil even on DRK lol
[4:01:35] <BobbyHopp> the reaper armor they showed will be the same for dragoon
[4:01:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @kainhighwind1990 Kain armor is already in the game tho
[4:01:44] <%OnyxMemory> isnt kain armor already one of the drg relic sets
[4:01:50] <some_brave_apollo> my only complaint is they never added a dark knight cecil set to go with the baron helm
[4:01:54] <penitentpendant> Armory Chest YOU SAY?
[4:01:56] <@TheYellowcouch> COME ON
[4:01:58] <+RealThiele> MIRAGE LUL

[4:19:09] <@QueequegTheater> Ala Mhigo was Persia, not India
[4:19:10] <@TheYellowcouch> Ala Mhigo is the Middle east

[4:25:30] <T_Sasquatch> Ok ?
[4:25:32] <penitentpendant> Would it be OP if it made sprint infinite in cities?
[4:25:34] <%Ritei> why not just make sprint permanent inn cities
[4:25:55] <CurrySauseBandit> @boxnavy It's not exactly something people were going quit over. Probably a low prior to-do list kinda thing.
[4:26:16] <Goobbue> what did it do before?
[4:26:31] <+RealThiele> thats a sentence
[4:26:33] <%Mekhet09> @Goobbue -15% weakness.
[4:26:33] <mental_mashup> So if hrothgars are furries does that retroactively make miqo’tes a subclass? Like a fuzzy?
[4:26:37] <CzeekyTV> oh infinite sprint in cities basically, nice
[4:26:39] <%nanaki_ff14> ok infiniate sprint

[4:27:26] <%Agami23> gacha time
[4:27:27] <DekaJack_> Its random Pat WHO KNOWS
[4:27:31] <%PatNTheHat> Maybe just from dungeons?
[4:27:33] <bestwaifuritsu> what about those missing GC ranks
[4:27:36] <%BoxNavy> banners
[4:27:37] <penitentpendant> I mean... it's a use for those seals
[4:27:40] <+Talimity> FIREWORKS
[4:27:43] <+Double_Tap_That> Loot boxes!
[4:27:43] <%PatNTheHat> Like the Morbol from Aurum Vale?

[4:27:54] <olaksi> oh god no more firecrackers
[4:27:55] <%A_Zealous_Retort> maybe it will be like the restoration thing with the scratch cards
[4:27:56] <bestwaifuritsu> INDIGO PRISM GACHA AGAIN
[4:27:56] <mental_mashup> Guaranteed what?
[4:27:59] <karl_rex> damn those fireworks
[4:28:00] <%The_Protagonist> works like the POD sacks
[4:28:00] <+Rofiarf> can you get duplicates?
[4:28:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> Something like lockboxses I guess
[4:28:02] <+killer_squid1990> Wait you can't obtain the morbol anymore?
[4:28:05] <iosephe> there could be anything in there, there could even be a boat
[4:28:06] <DekaJack_> Its just the usual lockbox
[4:28:07] <zetanidura> fuck getting prisms
[4:28:09] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt itll be like Bozja boxes.
[4:28:15] <@TheYellowcouch> Extreme mount farms are gonna be real different now
[4:28:18] <Amperture> I mean why would you not spend seals on like Ventures, or Aether Tickets, or Glamour Prisms to shove on the market board.
[4:28:18] <Goobbue> Would be cool if stuff like the Grand Company horses were rare in those because fuck PvP
[4:28:19] <%chill_o_wisp> GACHA BAYBEE
[4:28:19] <%sw_paladin> NO MORE FIRECRACKERS

[4:28:34] <Xelhesia> ?
[4:28:39] <mental_mashup> Two
[4:28:46] <%bear_breaker20> spatial audio in an mmo sounds illegal
[4:28:53] <+DiscouragedOblong> SPatial audio actually sounds like it could be dope in raids and stuff
[4:28:56] <%bear_breaker20> too immersive
[4:28:59] <+Greywyn00> maybe the old feast mounts will be in there
[4:29:01] <Purpleleven> Now I can hear the rp-ers in Limsa even if they're behind me
[4:29:09] <2DSuperiority> lalas WAH surrounding you

[4:29:47] <iosephe> what
[4:29:53] <%Chichen> nah i think im good
[4:29:53] <mental_mashup> You couldn’t pay me to use this add-on
[4:29:55] <@QueequegTheater> >addons
[4:29:56] <zetanidura> curious how this compares to the current sound engine
[4:30:03] <%croxeye> it's the PS5 thing on PC i think
[4:30:03] <CzeekyTV> aaaand back to not caring
[4:30:03] <%InternetShis> Ew paid add-on
[4:30:04] <%The_Protagonist> ?? wait i don't understand I already hear things based on where they are in the game
[4:30:08] <+DiscouragedOblong> I thought 3rd party software was a big nono
[4:30:08] <%Dregon_Azure> paid addon?
[4:30:11] <+zajoestar> FOR ERP??
[4:30:14] <+Toshatron> cerny wants to know your ear shape
[4:30:15] <penitentpendant> ...it's a yearly subscription service?
[4:30:24] <%Dregon_Azure> no thanks? lol
[4:30:24] <penitentpendant> Weird
[4:30:27] <+RealThiele> its legit we swear

[4:30:38] <%Neryl_> Add ons? In my pure XIV experience? I would never.
[4:30:39] <iosephe> it's legit
[4:30:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> Its specifically mentions 14 embody's website if anyones interested
[4:30:52] <%The_Protagonist> i'm honestly confused, the game sounds literally are already based on character positions for me, is that not normal? lol
[4:30:56] <%InternetShis> I'm gonna continue using fan mods

[4:31:56] <+DiscouragedOblong> Prob working on patch tracks now
[4:31:57] <@TheYellowcouch> well he is the sound director
[4:31:58] <+RealThiele> 6.1 music
[4:31:58] <%Chichen> maybe
[4:31:59] <+Double_Tap_That> Absolute chadman
[4:32:07] <%MrBorisMakarov> someone pointed out, he looks so awake compared to everyone lmao
[4:32:07] <%InternetShis> Very good
[4:32:08] <%tusk102> 6.1
[4:32:09] <@TheYellowcouch> so he does ALL sound
[4:32:09] <@QueequegTheater> That's why he's here, everyone else is working in the minion gacha mines
[4:32:11] <Sargonyx> been
[4:32:18] <+zajoestar> Patch music
[4:32:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> hes sound director as well as composer
[4:32:29] <%sw_paladin> Look at those 2 goofballs
[4:32:39] <Goobbue> He's composing XVI too right? Wonder where that is in progress now
[4:32:39] <+RealThiele> Levia thuuun
[4:32:58] <%vaporousTippler> In before the entire moon is 100% silent.
[4:33:14] <%nanaki_ff14> pft he so is
[4:33:23] <+RealThiele> i mean hes a worthy successor to Uematsu
[4:33:24] <%TEANTACLES> OK BUT ANTIALIASING, PLEASE
[4:33:27] <Goobbue> it sounds exactly like it's by him lol
[4:33:29] <+Medrex> The trailer music for 16 has Soken's fingerprints all over it
[4:33:31] <%nanaki_ff14> If Yoshi has his way he will
[4:33:32] <%The_Protagonist> THE GAME ALREADY HAS THAT
[4:33:33] <%BoxNavy> i dont know what 3d audio is :)
[4:33:39] <nevan_44> i trust alex moukala LUL
[4:33:46] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> if the FFIV soundtrack is anything to go by the Moon ost will be space farts
[4:33:50] <Midboss87> his sound style is for sure in the FF16 trailers
[4:33:56] <iosephe> no
[4:34:01] <@QueequegTheater> NEVER
[4:34:03] <+cascadepersona> At least add TAA
[4:34:04] <omega_reddu> 4KJaggies
[4:34:08] <@QueequegTheater> YOU WILL REMAIN ALIASED
[4:34:17] <penitentpendant> @ItsYaGirlMaria So the dungeon would be 'clowns farting in the basement'?
[4:34:18] <Goobbue> I was actually listening to FFXV's ost today and I am going to miss Yoko Shimomura if she's not doing anything for XVI this time
[4:34:22] <%OrangeMDT> Why is Pat awake?
[4:34:24] <%BoxNavy> :)
[4:34:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> Atmos?
[4:34:32] <%OrangeMDT> I just got here
[4:34:34] <@DakotaMacDoodle> AA would be great
[4:34:34] <nevan_44> no u
[4:34:36] <@QueequegTheater> Gee you thinnk
[4:34:38] <PageofHeart> I love Filler
[4:34:40] <%The_Protagonist> wait but... what is different about this then?
[4:34:41] <%Like51bears> no you only get anti alisaie
[4:34:42] <ohno778> is there mod for anti aliasing?
[4:34:42] <%MrBorisMakarov> they were probably give big money by SE to get this in
[4:34:42] <Rao2357> Because Live Letter, Orange.
[4:34:42] <Srthunda> this seems like its been paid for
[4:34:43] <%Dregon_Azure> skipppp
[4:34:43] <%DashXero> A waste of time until you put on headphones and shit your pants.
[4:34:45] <%Saadi90> DLSS would be great too but will never happen
[4:34:46] <%vaporousTippler> This reminds me of when City of Heroes went all-in on PhysX cards.
[4:34:46] <+RealThiele> the 1000 people that will pay money for this
[4:34:47] <%nanaki_ff14> Seems like somthing bards will like lol
[4:34:47] <%bear_breaker20> this is lowkey for the perverts
[4:34:48] <CzeekyTV> if soken wants it i say ill allow it
[4:34:48] <Macguffn> They told Soken, "You get one" and he chose this
[4:34:51] <penitentpendant> This feels like they're either paid for this or Soken wrangled new equipment for his band via this
[4:34:52] <kayamek> Bards now have to worrry about acoustics?
[4:34:53] <%kyh9> It's likely easier to add to the engine than AA
[4:34:53] <%AnIcedCoffee> Embody paid them for this definitely
[4:35:01] <omega_reddu> Remember the 3000 dollaer guitar?
[4:35:09] <+zajoestar> This is why the game was delayed
[4:35:17] <+cascadepersona> There's a page on Embody's website that has a demo on it
[4:35:21] <%kyh9> For what it's worth, the graphics of FFXIV need a LOT more work, Spatial Audio is likely easier to add than better lighting or AA
[4:35:23] <%BoxNavy> SourPls beef soft tacosa
[4:35:28] <@QueequegTheater> That's not correct
[4:35:29] <Saltmeisterr> oh the stream wasn't over lol
[4:35:31] <%NitronStreams> 1 hour of talking about binaural audio for the 5 people that will use this add-on
[4:35:33] <Midboss87> beef soft TACOS
[4:35:34] <+SolidusRex> BIG FAT TACOS SUPREME
[4:35:37] <@QueequegTheater> We hear sound through two distinct spots
[4:35:43] <+RealThiele> 360 degreees of taco supremacy

[4:36:44] <@QueequegTheater> TALK ABOUT THE GOLD SAUCER. PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU
[4:36:50] <Midboss87> yeah this shits already on embodys website
[4:36:50] <+cascadepersona> That Embody audio demo for FFXIV is definitely loud
[4:37:00] <Purpleleven> Stop talking about surround sound, just kill The Feast again and we'll be set
[4:37:06] <%The_Protagonist> ??? but it already DOES THAT
[4:37:06] <tukds> Pat be funny
[4:37:09] <penitentpendant> The only thing that'd be worth it for me now: If they showed Hildebrand stuff after this
[4:37:15] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt you know as soon as you leave they're gonna start talking about the thing you want the most right
