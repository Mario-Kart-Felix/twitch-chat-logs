[0:02:08] <pipboy344> @jobbedbone game com
[0:02:11] <Raged_Archangel> Dusk is a fantastic Quake-inspired twitch shooter.
[0:02:11] <%KoiRedd> Thanks for the PrideHeyyy @tizz86
[0:02:15] <+michingmallecho> Hey did y’all hear from that a character in TLOU2 actually is modeled off Neil druckmann. Feels meta
[0:02:30] <+rosabellamelantha> Dusk is legitimately my favourite game of 2018
[0:02:31] <+Klonoa__> Dusk is rad
[0:02:33] <%vectorless_peon> Dusk rocks
[0:02:37] <%pipboy344> Thanks
[0:02:40] <%BoneofMalkav> Dusk is what happens when you mix Quake with Blood and Doom
[0:02:42] <Raged_Archangel> Dusk is astounding.
[0:02:43] <%WorldSoup5> Dude I saw that, it’s crazy psaLiz
[0:02:47] <jobbedbone> google order corn
[0:02:52] <%toolofparanoia> its fast, low poly but scary and has a hell of a fucking awesome sound track
[0:02:59] <Raged_Archangel> Dusk's soundtrack ins amazing as well!
[0:03:01] <+rosabellamelantha> I hope pat at least gets to episode 3 so he can see how off the wall it gets
[0:03:10] <pennykettle_> dusk is more fun than doom eternal fight me.
[0:03:14] <+rosabellamelantha> it is
[0:03:20] <+rosabellamelantha> Dusk is fantastic
[0:03:28] <The_wafflizer> So apparently dusk is based
[0:03:30] <Raged_Archangel> @pennykettle_ I agree
[0:03:30] <SeanPrime22> now that Mick Gordon is gone they should get Andrew Hulshult to compose for DOOM
[0:03:31] <+michingmallecho> I googled Dusk and it frightens me. In a good way
[0:03:32] <%BoneofMalkav> Especially now that Dusk is getting opened to modding.
[0:03:55] <+myrasis> Pog dusk
[0:03:59] <%WorldSoup5> Hype time
[0:04:03] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Robert_Eccles) (warning)
[0:04:14] <SeanPrime22> Pat should also stream the Gloomwood and Ultrakill demos
[0:04:15] <+VvTacoSaladvV> Finally catching a stream live cause Dusk was my GOTY
[0:04:27] <pennykettle_> I have been fans of newblood since they initially checked out dusk on the channel years ago but im embrassed I didnt buy dusk until this week. I was waiting for a big sale but their PC show appearance made me go for full price

[0:23:00] <%koffeemancer> @PatStaresAt She talked about that on an Interview with conan o brian, but she didnt mention the sexy bits
[0:23:03] <%CursedNobleman> DansGame
[0:23:03] <Raged_Archangel> The problem I have is that TLOU 1 was effective because it was a great story with "moments" of violence, which is why it was effective. TLOU 2 seems to just be a violence romp with "moments" of story.
[0:23:04] <narusao> FailFish
[0:23:05] <%maenos2> @SeanPrime22 she's done a fair amount. a friend found a commercial thing she did i think

[0:24:36] <%marvel877> Pat, my mom walked in and saw me watching the stream and was shocked to hear that you're 34.
[0:24:40] <+Neoepochx> Nah but subversion man.
[0:24:40] <RichochetForce> This is the worst year for this brutal type of game.
[0:24:40] <$Dakuu75> sounds like passion of christ, just torture porn.
[0:24:41] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I like abject misery a lot, but I'm weird
[0:24:43] <InvisibleMan101> Pain.
[0:24:43] <%Piemono> To be fair, most of that shit couldn't be changed at this point
[0:24:43] <+Neoepochx> @Bailey__gaming Me too.
[0:24:44] <%Valdorick> To be fair, I feel like even without the current event context, this game is over the top.

[0:25:10] <Thirtine> "violence porn" can be very cathartic for some people and for certain mindsets, but the global climate isnt really suitaable for it right now

[0:25:59] <+Neoepochx> It is kinda how I feel about Spec Ops, but TLoU2 has baggage of previous characters that it also dumps on.
[0:26:01] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Jesus, Joel!!"
[0:26:01] <%worldbrand> isnt it funny how ludonarrative dissonance became a tired topic in 2014 but we're still having the same problems

[0:27:34] <+Neoepochx> Plus it also fucking marks your file, that you have to go out of your way to fix, for subsequent playthroughs.
[0:27:35] <%ragingbrachy> congrats you cant play the game anymore
[0:27:36] <%weissguard> It didn't hit me like how it was intended, but I can see where people would get hit hard by it.
[0:27:37] <+thetwistedrabbit> But what if TLOU2 had a shopping cart level?
[0:27:39] <%realm_forge> Whereas Mario cart openly encourages you to murder your friends
[0:27:39] <+michingmallecho> The last of us was the monsters we became at the end...too
[0:27:39] <%deadsevenvy> Good point, the pay off is almost nothing besides a little bit of lore
[0:27:42] <StencilOST> but that undine the undying fight though
[0:27:43] <%skizzuto> love how it lambasts that completionist mentaltiy
[0:27:44] <%a_goth_pancake> but then you get vs. Sans and it's sick.
[0:27:49] <%M3djedx> Genocide run and then passive is the worst ending and I live for that
[0:27:53] <%weissguard> That always bothered me, tbh.
[0:27:55] <%mMayrro> filthy frank just comes into your room with the giant clock
[0:27:57] <XelGel> and then it punishes you for doing it
[0:27:59] <+HallowedGuru> iirc sans even calls out people who watch videos of genocide runs with like "you may not do it yourself, but watching it out of curiosity is fucked up too"
[0:28:00] <%kjsandwich> But you fight Sans
[0:28:03] <%ShichiNoBushi> Who has more Determination? You or the game?
[0:28:04] <filialpails> but how can you possibly expect naughty dog to have the kind of time and money toby fox does?
[0:28:06] <+Zer0Tw0> Zer0Tw0 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:28:07] <%cvp5127> pat you stink
[0:28:11] <Delrugal_> The pay off to the genocide run is megalovania
[0:28:12] <Thirtine> thats why megalovania plays, its really more Your Theme than the final boss's
[0:28:12] <%mMayrro> trash fusion?
[0:28:16] <%JD_Lars> And if you win you’re a monster forever
[0:28:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> See Path 2 does the same thing, but in reverse...It's easier to be an asshole..but you have to live with your decisons
[0:28:27] <%M3djedx> woolieTRASH

[0:28:39] <+Neoepochx> @thetwistedrabbit What if TLoU2 had a jump button? tpanimeKaibasurp
[0:28:40] <InvisibleMan101> hooray
[0:28:40] <%ragingbrachy> boooo you tyler
[0:28:43] <M4eta> "Don't kill and don't get killed, there are a lot of flowy out there"
[0:28:44] <%Frost_Quill> @Thirtine I love the moment in Undyne's genocide fight where the music itself turns against you. It's great.
[0:28:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I SAW A DOG TODAY
[0:28:46] <Torgue_1> 10 minutes LUL
[0:28:48] <+Shubreaker> spec ops was a pointed attack at the military-industrial complex and CoD's lionizing of it
[0:28:50] <%ragingbrachy> 👋
[0:28:50] <%sniffy77> With undertale you get to choose to not kill a enemy, because there's always a other solution, while in a TLOU gameplay esque game you might have to be forced to kill a enemy because you failed at sneaking, or a enounter was unavoidable.
[0:28:51] <%EdViper> 10 minutes he says
[0:28:55] <%BusterRepukken> Fucckmann admitting to watching Liveleak snuff shit for inspiration makes me think certain things about him. Reminds me of actors who method act but act extremely annoying in doing so and it's just like 'do you really need to do that'
[0:28:56] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> IT WAS A GOOD BOY BUT I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PET
[0:28:56] <%albret__einstrong> im gay
[0:28:57] <%MisterTylerrr> @ragingbrachy Suck my did haha
[0:29:01] <indig0bird> @maenos2 Hey, I'm not saying the game is perfect but the fact that there isn't a morality meter, the fact there is an existencial threat, allies treat good "honorable" actions well and you can be taken advantage by evil characters then revenge super hard makes it notably interesting
[0:29:07] <%ragingbrachy> @MisterTylerrr :)
[0:29:16] <+Neoepochx> @BusterRepukken Didn't you know that they don't use the word "Fun"?
[0:29:17] <+Shubreaker> it was so much more than "murder bad, stop murder"
[0:29:17] <%realm_forge> Pat eats butts for money
[0:29:17] <Thirtine> @Frost_Quill did you know that if you stall out and dont kill the undying, she just falls apart? its really neat
[0:29:22] <%deadsevenvy> Method acting for the sole purpose of being an asshole
[0:29:29] <+Kennentebest> i disagree i found the first last of us fun and stressful
[0:29:30] <+BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Death Stranding
[0:29:30] <%VvTacoSaladvV> The older I get the more I enjoy games that are pure mechanics.
[0:29:30] <SeanPrime22> THIS WAR OF MINE
[0:29:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> The thing is Tlou2 is lying it is fun, the killing is fun
[0:29:31] <%maenos2> @indig0bird Ah that's fiar. I just remember being able to pretty much do anything (outside of pissing in andraste's ashes) and calming down my teammates with cake. but I mean...its cake so...
[0:29:32] <televisedrevolting> Oh Pathologic?
[0:29:32] <RichochetForce> Masocore
[0:29:33] <%AncelDeLambert> Griefcore

[0:29:34] <%CursedNobleman> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:29:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> but you feel bad about it
[0:29:36] <+Neoepochx> That stress gives me life.

[0:29:40] <Norrdicus> This War of Mine, yeah
[0:29:42] <raveous> NIER
[0:29:42] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> pathologic is fucking fascinating in its misery
[0:29:42] <%worldbrand> idk if anyone else gets this, but darkest dungeon's stress damage carries over into real life for me
[0:29:42] <+Remery_> Masochist gameplay
[0:29:45] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Paper's Please
[0:29:46] <%Frost_Quill> @BusterRepukken I looked up some fucked up shit on liveleak and I regret it immensely.
[0:29:47] <+Beetlewins> XCOM does morality well. If you miss it is because you are a bad person
[0:29:50] <%realm_forge> Oh destiny raids?
[0:29:51] <%DappercatEsquire> But there has to be catharsis
[0:29:56] <soflicar> Papers Please

[0:30:03] <+Remery_> FFXIV Extreme raids
[0:30:04] <+RyanTheRecluse> STALKER is a pretty good miserable game as well
[0:30:05] <+myrasis> any drakengard gamers
[0:30:05] <madogod> Guys remember Pat has a degree in Psychology so he knows what hes talking about
[0:30:07] <warmnoid> death stranding is relaxing

[0:30:14] <%weissguard> 2b? More lilke 2 CHEEKS, MIRITE?
[0:30:14] <indig0bird> @maenos2 my friend gave me Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 when she saw me playing X1, gifts are nice lol
[0:30:14] <Thirtine> taking the evil options in planescape:torment feels genuinely bad
[0:30:15] <b_ikki> not even an interesting point
[0:30:15] <televisedrevolting> Ah fuck bud Lisa the Painful is amazing.
[0:30:16] <madskull456> oof
[0:30:16] <+Shirk_Diggler> oh god the road
[0:30:16] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> PAT THATS LITERALLY
[0:30:16] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> no
[0:30:17] <%M3djedx> Even red dead 2 does morality better than what TLOU2 is sounding
[0:30:18] <+michingmallecho> Big robot ass
[0:30:18] <+Shubreaker> misery for misery's sake
[0:30:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Death Stranding rewards you with roads and ziplines
[0:30:18] <%EdViper> oh yeah it's real sad
[0:30:18] <%Starotter70> A point that doesn't necesarily hit
[0:30:19] <%huskarl_zap> Pat that's wrong
[0:30:19] <%Valdorick> "See this beloved thing you like? We destroyed it, but made you do it, but fuck you, you did it."

[0:30:20] <+HallowedGuru> jermaPluto Yes
[0:30:21] <+lethallylactic> Oh nooo
[0:30:22] <%Pyroclase> it was a book too
[0:30:22] <%godzookylives> Book is WAY better

[0:30:23] <%CursedNobleman> @Beetlewins sir, I blew up an XCOM church because an objective was inside it. I have no morals
[0:30:23] <+ktothec99> Spec Ops, Drakengard, LISA
[0:30:24] <%ragingbrachy> never seen it
[0:30:24] <%Valdorick> The Mist?
[0:30:24] <%realm_forge> Fallout 76 has me scare d I’ll get hacked ya know fun!
[0:30:25] <RichochetForce> Oh god, The Road
[0:30:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> Tlou is lying tho. The killing gameplay is fun as shit
[0:30:27] <+BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt The Road is a REAL horror film
[0:30:29] <%Niney_Who> Just don't kill the Dogs, Player.
[0:30:30] <+pyrojack6> also a depressing book
[0:30:32] <+michingmallecho> I hate the road
[0:30:34] <+RyanTheRecluse> Fuck that movie, do not want
[0:30:37] <RichochetForce> The Mist's ending oh fuck
[0:30:37] <+King_floppy> Undertale Genocide Ending
[0:30:38] <%worldbrand> i hate the road as a book
[0:30:38] <Brother_Coduss> @PatStaresAt the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. movie?
[0:30:42] <+xBolts4Lifex> What we talking about?
[0:30:46] <%ragingbrachy> :)
[0:30:46] <pennykettle_> do we not know if TLOU2 does too?
[0:30:49] <+lethallylactic> Unless you think they're cannibals.
[0:30:50] <%kjsandwich> The Road is the most depressing ending ever
[0:30:51] <+Neoepochx> The fact that the reviewers shit on Pathologic 2 and then say "TLoU2 makes me feel bad! 10/10" is so hypocritical and shitty. Just because one is a Russian indie game and the other is a big budget dumpster fire it gets the higher praise.
[0:30:51] <+BeezusHrist> DO NOT WATCH THE ROAD
[0:30:54] <%blaccbird914> Oh man the mist's ending is so fucked
[0:30:56] <%Atomik456> COME AND MOTHERFUCKING SEE
[0:30:58] <+michingmallecho> The message was...the road rage was full of rocks
[0:31:01] <%realm_forge> Aragorn is a real bummer in that film
[0:31:01] <thesaverofhumens> tlou2 ending got leaked, its pure misery
[0:31:01] <Thirtine> HELL YEAH
[0:31:02] <+HallowedGuru> HELL YEAH
[0:31:03] <%CursedNobleman> FUN LUL
[0:31:03] <+Beetlewins> I'm sure TLOU2 will have small moments of levity
[0:31:03] <%Dementedpenguin> 4Head Fun?!
[0:31:04] <madskull456> destiny?
[0:31:04] <%Starotter70> yay
[0:31:04] <+Takuatt> Get those Gloomwood and Ultrakill demos installed as well, give Dave your money
[0:31:04] <%Pyroclase> Dusk is not depressing lmao
[0:31:06] <ScreamLord> Oh boy
[0:31:07] <+Beetlewins> The first one did
[0:31:07] <+Slingbone8> the road kicked my ass when I first saw it. then kicked my as again when I read it
[0:31:07] <%M3djedx> Watch the road if you wanna try thinking about suicide
[0:31:09] <%thegreenbenis> @pennykettle_ We know for a fact it doesn't
[0:31:10] <+pyrojack6> the characters in the book are so dehumanized they don't even have quotation marks on their dialouge
[0:31:11] <%Gogogolem> Pat i dont' want to be in your mom.
[0:31:12] <%Birdigalore> YEAH BLANK SCREEN
[0:31:12] <%jjolion> What is Fun?
[0:31:12] <%JamesCorck> dude, even Schindler's List had moments of rest and not 100% misery.
[0:31:13] <%ShichiNoBushi> Oh no! Fun!
[0:31:13] <%Frost_Quill> @xBolts4Lifex TLoU2 and games saying you, the player, are bad after making you do those bad things.
[0:31:14] <+BlueScarabGuy> I mean, you're making the assumption that LoU2 doesn't have those moments.
[0:31:14] <ObsidianDragon86> Time to see if Pat is WORTHY
[0:31:14] <+Neoepochx> Elgato...truly depressing.
[0:31:14] <%snake_msf_lh95> Hey pat do you also think that chris redfield will turn out to not be a bad guy in re8 ? Any theories ?
[0:31:15] <+rosabellamelantha> Dusk isn't depressing lol

[0:31:25] <%Valdorick> Well yeah, they can shit on indie devs, because the indie devs don't give the reviewers kickbacks.
[0:31:27] <%Jeemukun> The worst thing any kind of media can do is make you say or think "I don't care what happens to these people"
[0:31:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Time to watch PAt play his cooler self
[0:31:28] <%realm_forge> YEAH LETS WATCH THE NEWS

[0:31:55] <InvisibleMan101> when you stare into the Dusk does the Dusk stare back?
[0:31:55] <Louie_Salmon> @anceldelambert which one?

[0:33:10] <%Frost_Quill> @Jeemukun I have only felt that once or twice that I can remember, the last time was in a manga that painted bullies as being right to bully the weird kid because he snapped and went after them. They were never presented as wrong for bullying him even though the reason they bullied him for was a literal, actual lie.

[0:42:02] <%thelonechris> This game is basically rural PA simulator
[0:42:03] <SeanPrime22> STRAFE JUMP 4 SPEED
[0:42:04] <pennykettle_> you can also go hella fast if you walk forward and sideways
[0:42:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> I forgot the underground section chat

[0:42:10] <+ZedSlayer> it opened the ladder top
[0:42:13] <remdiel> what is a pat?
[0:42:17] <Brother_Coduss> @PatStaresAt no joke, soap bars you pick up and throw one shot enemies
[0:42:25] <Ipsenscastle> It has a chunky look to it, if you put googly eyes on everything it could be an N64 Rare game
[0:42:25] <%Essixian> @BeezusHrist I know, I saw it dip a little for like 2 seconds and decided to be a little shit for no reason. ravsBadMan
[0:42:34] <pennykettle_> duskguy is addicted to Quaaludes
[0:42:34] <+PatchworkSquid> That opened the gate above you.
[0:42:35] <%M3djedx> @feifong_wong One off I think
[0:42:35] <+ZedSlayer> QUAFF BEER
[0:42:37] <jobbedbone> guys. NO SOAP, RADIO!
[0:42:38] <%Bailey__gaming> GLASSES at Risk

[0:42:44] <%a_goth_pancake> bump @brother_coduss
[0:42:44] <+Klonoa__> remember to quaff beer
[0:42:51] <%sniffy77> darn. dusk isn't out on xbox one yet
[0:42:53] <+rosabellamelantha> No hitscan in this game
[0:42:55] <Them00n> This game has secrets out the ass
[0:42:56] <Mawarup> is it normal to feel not so good watching this?
[0:42:59] <%walternatorz> this is a nice home
[0:43:00] <%Essixian> HEXEN...
[0:43:01] <+SirSleepy> SOAP
[0:43:02] <pennykettle_> groovy
[0:43:04] <+SirSleepy> GET THE SOAP
[0:43:05] <ObsidianDragon86> SOAP!
[0:43:05] <+ZedSlayer> CHEKC THE SOAP
[0:43:06] <%DappercatEsquire> It's the house from Mandy
[0:43:07] <%ragingbrachy> GROOVY
[0:43:07] <SaltyAzteca> That is not groovy
[0:43:07] <+PatchworkSquid> Get the soap.
[0:43:07] <+BlackSunEmperor> GROOVY
[0:43:08] <%Feifong_wong> SOAP IN BATHROOM
[0:43:12] <%sniffy77> was that a motherufkcing demon cow
[0:43:14] <cliffpuncher> What are the odds the secrets are going to set off Pat's goblins?
[0:43:16] <Brother_Coduss> THROW THE SOAP AT AN ENEMY, IT'S A ONE SHOT
[0:43:17] <ObsidianDragon86> HE has forsaken the Soap
[0:43:18] <pennykettle_> you can also interact with the paintings
[0:43:18] <+PatchworkSquid> SOAP
[0:43:18] <+Dova573> MATENLO
[0:43:19] <%a_goth_pancake> oh you did. get used to it
[0:43:22] <%VvTacoSaladvV> demon goat yes
[0:43:28] <+BeezusHrist> @Essixian Keep in mind that if it is dipping, it's the stream and Pat won't be able to see it.
[0:43:29] <ObsidianDragon86> He is not WORTHY of the Soap
[0:43:37] <+rosabellamelantha> The regular shotgun hits further away than the super shotgun and takes less ammo but the SSG is busted at close range
[0:43:39] <%Ranryu692> was this a Shitstorm game?
[0:43:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> Soap is an advanced tactic
[0:43:42] <RunningNGunning> Strafe hop for ridiculous speed btw
[0:43:47] <%DappercatEsquire> Just like real life
[0:43:47] <%Rngiddion> it kills bosses too
[0:43:48] <+TabbyNickel> the soap
[0:43:51] <%Essixian> Soap-kun is the absolute strongest there is.
[0:43:53] <+mecha_sniper_joe> eww controller
[0:43:53] <@commanderclaw> There's a bar of soap in every level
[0:43:54] <%Starotter70> Just like Melee
[0:43:57] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Jump and look down
[0:43:57] <%DappercatEsquire> @Ranryu692 I think you're thinking of Blood
[0:43:58] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Soap OP
[0:44:01] <%thelonechris> That flat tree wall
[0:44:02] <%snake_msf_lh95> SeemsGood
[0:44:03] <+kuningaz45> Is this mans using a controller and texture filtering
[0:44:05] <%Feifong_wong> I think you missed one of them
[0:44:06] <+rosabellamelantha> Missing secrets is fine
[0:44:06] <%walternatorz> is it?
[0:44:06] <ObsidianDragon86> In fact nearly all of them >_>
[0:44:10] <%Rngiddion> a ton don't worry about it or you will insane
[0:44:11] <+rosabellamelantha> this game gives you a lot
[0:44:11] <+ZedSlayer> i dunno if a riveter is in this or not
[0:44:11] <%Ranryu692> @dappercatesquire probably
[0:44:16] <%ragingbrachy> secrets are for nerds
[0:44:17] <+trav2_> is it though?
[0:44:19] <+myrasis> you gotta try strafe jumping
[0:44:19] <Ipsenscastle> that's why they're secret

[0:44:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Tree walk
[0:44:29] <+rosabellamelantha> Missing secrets is super fine
[0:44:30] <%Essixian> Only missed one seek-a-rit.
[0:44:31] <%Pyroclase> I love that loading screen
[0:44:32] <pennykettle_> yeyeye
[0:44:32] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, there was a grate you could have broken
[0:44:36] <%a_goth_pancake> totally.

[0:44:36] <ObsidianDragon86> Whoops. My Bad sorry Pat
[0:44:37] <%emperordread> Gotta hug up on all those walls in case they are invisble

[0:44:42] <+dmtjinni> PLUG Walk
[0:44:43] <pennykettle_> I love the popup text
[0:44:43] <+SirSleepy> If you sideways hop really fast at the end of this level you can jump over the end game fence and see a fun message
[0:44:44] <mesamus> HERETIC
[0:44:46] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I never try to find all secrets on my first playthrough
[0:44:48] <+Dova573> Down on Plagues Farm
[0:44:54] <%Dementedpenguin> I miss being able to move this fast in fps games
[0:44:54] <+Sleepy_Puma> Back flip pat
[0:44:56] <+SaltySombrero> Spinnin those shotties
[0:44:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> Tree Walls are dream cast perfection
[0:44:59] <thesaverofhumens> I hope he finds the jerma zone
[0:45:01] <%chambatron> I think the zaibatsu played this wayback when right?
[0:45:01] <%Starotter70> Your guy sounds like Minecraft Man when he gets hit
[0:45:01] <%snake_msf_lh95> Actually now that i think about it ive saw gameplay of this a while back
[0:45:03] <%DappercatEsquire> This, but a rhythm game
[0:45:07] <BigNerdSam> Hey Pat, hit reload
[0:45:07] <Storm_Samurai> Eli feels at home here
[0:45:10] <+ZedSlayer> hey theress a crack in that silo

[0:45:18] <+Klonoa__> hup hup hup hup

[0:45:25] <+Klonoa__> yeah jerma did
[0:45:25] <%thelonechris> This game makes me want a proper sequel to Blood
[0:45:27] <+SaltySombrero> Will pat try Ultrakill sometime?
[0:45:27] <+ZedSlayer> also press 0 on the keyboard
[0:45:27] <ObsidianDragon86> Diagonal Strafe for LUDICROUS SPEED!
[0:45:31] <+PatchworkSquid> Do we spoil the secrets? Or nah?
[0:45:32] <+Takuatt> New Blood seems to have hit the nail on the head with focusing on gamefeel between this, Amid Evil, Ultrakill and Gloomwood
[0:45:33] <mesamus> pat the quick fire power up lets you shoot the shotgun like if it was a machinegun
[0:45:36] <+SaltySombrero> no reload Kreygasm
[0:45:37] <+Klonoa__> pretty sure jerma beat the whole thing on stream
[0:45:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> what year would this have fit in? 1998?
[0:45:40] <+BoboDaHobo> there's a jerma zone? I remember he streamed it but I must have missed that
[0:45:44] <%StooEsq> Don't worry about that Scarecrow, it can't hurt you
[0:45:46] <BigNerdSam> You should press the reload button anyways
[0:45:46] <thesaverofhumens> he did stream it
[0:45:46] <KingVantq> @PatchworkSquid unless he asks nah
[0:45:46] <RazielTheDark> I assume you know you can do flips too right?
[0:45:48] <chromonaut747> reloading was a mistake
[0:45:51] <ArkSeaside> oh fuck yeah I got in here for Dusk, how's he liking it?
[0:45:53] <+Dova573> Crazy Talk you reload the shotguns
[0:45:54] <+ZedSlayer> Try the Cigar too, its like, 0 on the keyboard, or 9
[0:45:56] <%snake_msf_lh95> @thelonechris I know how you feel
[0:45:59] <+SirSleepy> He guys, make sure he finds the baby room
[0:46:01] <%Pyroclase> I dunno this feels more like 1999

[0:57:55] <%ragingbrachy> thats kinda dope
[0:57:57] <Thirtine> POKE
[0:58:00] <%Feifong_wong> @PatStaresAt Do your goblins not bother you if you miss a secret in games like this?
[0:58:03] <trianglehat> *pop*

[0:58:09] <dukenux> Killdozer?
[0:58:09] <+lanik745> like popping a balloon
[0:58:09] <+YabbaTroll> hey its dk diabeetus
[0:58:13] <DKDiamantes> Thats the most okay sword I've ever seen
[0:58:21] <AkumaFalcon93> How you liking that dusk?
[0:58:24] <+jetjagger222> only in doom 2 at higher difficulties
[0:58:25] <%Feifong_wong> Gotcha
[0:58:28] <+Remery_> Goblins defeated?
[0:58:29] <natebud> Pretty sure the sword is zelda rules, 100+ health = magic sword
[0:58:33] <Gieron667> this "secret" is basically a cheat code ... i hate this
[0:58:34] <+LokimenD> @PatStaresAt Hold altfire to block with the sword
[0:58:35] <%MisterTylerrr> If you don't know it's there, how is it supposed to bug you?
[0:58:39] <%Starotter70> psaGoblin Goblins be Gone psaGoblin
[0:58:41] <%linSP> i have to find every secret on the hardest mode so i never have to play it again
[0:58:41] <%ragingbrachy> i have the same goblins as pat and hes right
[0:58:42] <Louie_Salmon> You don't really need all the secrets either, sometimes it's just health and armor
[0:58:43] <%BoneofMalkav> Also, Speed runs for Dusk are WILD
[0:58:44] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt I would think there's also no progression contingent, in part, on finding those secrets
[0:58:46] <%derpumpkinking> @patstaresat A little late, but we're those dope Triangle-Men?
[0:58:46] <%xWanderingFlame> psaGoblin
[0:58:47] <Foonerism> some of the secrets in this are ridiculous obtuse
[0:58:48] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt this is suck a good haloween game that you already did a look at it for shitstorm btw
[0:58:49] <%deadsevenvy> Ambience really reminds me of EW 2, a lot of the same steps. You can says its just generic horror, but theres something about it
[0:58:51] <Profmcstevie> If you find all our secrets first time, we did a bad job
[0:58:53] <%AncelDeLambert> GRENADES
[0:58:58] <pennykettle_> cant you block with the sickles too?
[0:58:59] <%AncelDeLambert> sward
[0:59:04] <%TheWinged7> s-word
[0:59:05] <%ShichiNoBushi> T posing.
[0:59:06] <b_ikki> nah you can only parry with sickles
[0:59:08] <+rosabellamelantha> before you leave this level there's a lever in this pit that opens a secret in the other secret you saw earlier
[0:59:10] <CMash2k> spin sword?
[0:59:11] <dukenux> What does it do in Quicksilver?
[0:59:13] <%ZComiX> arent those end game weapons?
[0:59:13] <%ragingbrachy> WutFace RATS
[0:59:14] <%linSP> im da giant rat
[0:59:15] <+SirSleepy> What made you wanna check out Dusk? Just because?
[0:59:16] <%Atomik456> @Gieron667 it's not bad, everything pat got he would get this level or the next except the sword
[0:59:17] <%BusterRepukken> whoever told him the all weapons secret is dumb
[0:59:17] <%Feifong_wong> You can only block and stab with the sword if you're over a certain amount of Morale
[0:59:18] <JayEarly> @pennykettle_ you can reflect projectiles with the sickle
[0:59:19] <Midnight188> do we send him to secret level?
[0:59:19] <+rosabellamelantha> or that might be earlier
[0:59:20] <chromonaut747> fookin rats
[0:59:23] <%bevyrage> geez that guy popped like a balloon
[0:59:25] <%AncelDeLambert> they prey at nigth they stalk at night
[0:59:32] <b_ikki> there is not end game weapons you get your arsenal super fast in this
[0:59:32] <trianglehat> you did thing

[0:59:55] <+rosabellamelantha> BEST LEVEL
[0:59:55] <+LokimenD> @PatStaresAt You can beat every level without killing anyone FYI
[0:59:57] <Gieron667> @Atomik456 thats my point, getting a new weapon in a game like this is a "moment" he will now not experience

[1:00:21] <+Klonoa__> can just break the windows instead of key it's kino
[1:00:28] <%DappercatEsquire> fuck up those headstones

[1:01:25] <%BoneofMalkav> Some might argue the only good thing about the PS2 version of Deus Ex 1 is the cutscenes

[1:22:45] <%Feifong_wong> Low Morale means you can't stab or block

[1:22:46] <%Zereaux> ITS A TRICK WEAPON PAT
[1:22:47] <Them00n> Health below 100
[1:22:50] <+Takuatt> Need 100+ health

[1:44:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> Destiny is not good
[1:44:58] <%wolfofsound> so pat is to destiny what lewis black is to candy corn?
[1:45:03] <Balay123> Is this Doom

[1:45:21] <%Ranryu692> there was text on that goo pile
[1:45:21] <$RealThiele> destiny knows their audiences addictions at least
[1:45:21] <%toolofparanoia> Destiny is better with friends... I say as none of my friends are on right now and im solo queuing Gambit Prime

[1:45:41] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt I guess I should mention that the game has cooking mechanics at about this point

[1:46:09] <%snake_msf_lh95> @toolofparanoia You are right destiny is ok without friends and a slight better with friends
[1:46:12] <DavidSanChan> paige left her bones out after a session with them
[1:46:19] <%mMayrro> yeah take that Vas
[1:46:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> @toolofparanoia Cocaine is also good with friends, but it's addictive and has dimmishing returns per use. and gets more explotative as you use it
[1:46:23] <%Pyroclase> I hope you finish this game on stream, some of the later levels are just incredible

[2:16:10] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt So the reason I was talking about the FOV slider at max is because instead of a number it says either "Cynical" or "Totalbiscuit"
[2:16:12] <+rosabellamelantha> Shoot enemy through wall
[2:16:12] <%BubbaRands> NO
[2:16:14] <lloyddboy> hup

[2:19:08] <+egalitarian696969> the auto aim in this game feels like OG doom's
[2:19:11] <GetGianni> tbh elmo's meowing would work REALLY WELL as ambiance in DUSK

[2:31:02] <mori1993> @Oshry I've already got Dusk, but I'm thinking about getting Amid Evil.
[2:31:03] <StormyStrife> money shredder go brrr
[2:31:03] <%BoneofMalkav> And HeXen doesn't tell you where you need to go half the time, just. "You've solved 1/100th of the Puzzle."

[2:31:12] <+How2BEpic> Dusk looks good
[2:31:16] <ReiDuran> I'm a big pansy baby and get big scared at the game whenever I play even though it's not even scary but it's real good
[2:31:21] <%BoneofMalkav> Dusk IS good
[2:31:34] <+How2BEpic> but how does it smell?
[2:31:35] <+Neoepochx> Dusk is in the top 5 games of 2018
[2:31:35] <ReiDuran> But HOLY SHIT THAT ONE ENEMY THAT SHOWS UP IN EPISODE 2
[2:31:44] <%xWanderingFlame> I’m more of a dawn kinda guy

[2:34:07] <%TioXyco> fucking rats
[2:34:08] <StormyStrife> did you know that rats prowl at night and they also stalk at night?
[2:34:11] <%DappercatEsquire> oh, this doesn't look great
[2:34:11] <+Neoepochx> CHEESE IT.
[2:34:16] <+xmetalicdemonx> Thats cool
[2:34:16] <+Neoepochx> @anticrust Bloodborne 3.

[2:34:21] <+Neoepochx> Bloodborne 2 is Gloomwood
[2:34:22] <%DrawlNeedler> The ratacombs await Pat
[2:34:24] <%gespenst25> they're the rats
[2:34:28] <+Neoepochx> They released it in a weird order. Kappa
[2:34:43] <AlphaTauri> is there a big rat
[2:34:45] <StormyStrife> Funfact: Big rats make all of the rules and they're really interested in seeing what trouble they get you into
[2:34:46] <+How2BEpic> I had seen a speedrun of Amid Evil sometime ago

[2:40:00] <geassguy360> this song is great but it's no Keepers of the Gate

[2:40:12] <StormyStrife> I love how DUSK has a bunch of mechanics that it ltierally doesn't need, yet it still has it, like did you know you can light something on fire, put it in/under a water source and douse the flames?
[2:40:15] <+MakishimaWolf> the hunting rifel is good for those fireball guys pat
[2:40:20] <+Neoepochx> 1 bullet

[2:40:39] <seniormeatbox> HUP
[2:40:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> @StormyStrife or how you can sometimes find raw meat and if you put it on an open flame you can eat it after it gets cooked

[2:40:53] <ArkSeaside> ducking back in on my break. this level is sick. how did he do on the Experiments?
[2:41:00] <%Faustgesicht> rivet gun kinda nullifies the crossbow, doesnt it?
[2:41:10] <StormyStrife> And yet the game is amazing despite all of those thnigs. Really drives home that a good game only depends on a dev spending the time and caring about making something fun.
[2:41:19] <seniormeatbox> @ArkSeaside Exactly how you expected. He got stuck on the button puzzle for 5 minutes

[2:41:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> also i have to bring up how *was* an early access game on Unity
[2:41:48] <+rosabellamelantha> why does dusk seem harder to control movement on a controller
[2:41:48] <cipher758> cool

[2:42:09] <%anticrust> Stumbo go up
[2:42:16] <+egalitarian696969> dusk movement isn't built for analog sticks, it has 2 speeds: stop and full speed
[2:42:16] <%de1ete_forever> flame bad

[2:42:25] <%Essixian> @rosabellamelantha Mouse movement allows for much more precise control than sticks
[2:42:29] <InXplotch> rocket jump?
[2:42:33] <seniormeatbox> so when will pat figure out he can open doors
[2:42:37] <%de1ete_forever> there are known knowns and known unknowns
[2:42:40] <%vermillionzetta> HUP
[2:42:42] <%TheWinged7> LUL
[2:42:51] <mori1993> There's a second shotgun 'round the back of the silo with a ladder in front.
[2:43:20] <StormyStrife> funfact: Pat almost got into there, and you actually can totally do that since you have full air control in the game at all times, it's just really hard.
[2:43:20] <+theodolitejones> Did Pat find the secret climbing powerup?
[2:43:21] <+500_pts> Look for the green fart gass
[2:43:22] <+rosabellamelantha> Nah, controllers are usually better at general movement, it's like the one thing they're better at than keyboard, what @egalitarian696969 said is more right
[2:43:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> @de1ete_forever No such thing as unknown unknowns though, because I've never heard of any.
[2:43:24] <%a_goth_pancake> still m1?
[2:43:26] <%StaceMcGate> psaBlind
[2:43:27] <%chrispypopcorn> I feel like either Pat is losing weight or gaining beard
[2:43:28] <+rosabellamelantha> Dusk wasn't made for it
[2:43:46] <cliffpuncher> @theodolitejones I thought getting that was the critical path through the level
[2:43:49] <+MushyCornbread> What i always liked about these games was how simple they look but how difficult it is to figure out secrets and puzzles
[2:43:56] <%a_goth_pancake> @chrispypopcorn why can't be both?
[2:43:56] <%Coystick> Duskour
[2:44:06] <+500_pts> look for the fatrt gass
[2:44:13] <%chrispypopcorn> @a_goth_pancake That's a fair point
[2:44:18] <SulfurousAcid> maybe if you switched to mouse an keyboard you could lol
[2:44:20] <seniormeatbox> ladder by fart gass
[2:44:21] <%Essixian> @chrispypopcorn He's burning the orb to gain more beard
[2:44:25] <+500_pts> look
[2:44:27] <+500_pts> down below
[2:44:29] <AlphaTauri> glad theres no fall damage
[2:44:35] <%StaceMcGate> it seems that controllers are not helpful
[2:44:37] <%de1ete_forever> and ppl say controller is better for movement than wasd
[2:44:37] <%a_goth_pancake> heard go up as weight go down
[2:44:42] <+theodolitejones> @cliffpuncher I could have sworn there was a secret one. Maybe I'm just misremembering
[2:44:47] <ArkSeaside> has he been to the silo yet
[2:44:54] <+taren27> I wonder what Paige is cooking. Seems like she's doing a lot of...grating?
[2:44:54] <seniormeatbox> @ArkSeaside guess
[2:45:02] <%TheWinged7> rocket jump>
[2:45:05] <StormyStrife> no he hasn't yet
[2:45:16] <ArkSeaside> hoo boy
[2:45:22] <cipher758> patkour
[2:45:27] <%spiritofmojave> @taren27 cheese maybe!
[2:45:35] <%Essixian> @de1ete_forever It depends, they're generally better for third person games because they let you control movement in a full 360 degree arc independently of the camera. Devil May Cry is a good example.
[2:45:46] <+theodolitejones> This ain't no pro Dusk but I hope Pat has fun
[2:46:05] <%de1ete_forever> @Essixian indeed

[2:46:35] <SulfurousAcid> is it not their fault hough?
[2:46:37] <%spiritofmojave> pretty sure they still know how to bathe and all
[2:46:40] <%Essixian> @de1ete_forever Compared to WASD where you are locked to movement in 8 specific directions.
[2:46:40] <seniormeatbox> pat the fart gas hides a ladder
[2:46:41] <+500_pts> RIight by those jump pads
[2:46:45] <ArkSeaside> pat you wanna find a way into the chimney
[2:46:45] <jase__x> man does this game give anyone else a bit of motion sickness
[2:46:46] <+500_pts> the fart gas
[2:46:48] <+theodolitejones> Pat did you know you can flip in the air?
[2:46:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat do more flips
[2:47:03] <Them00n> @PatStaresAt Is Dusk gonna be a one off?
[2:47:11] <seniormeatbox> the farts pat
[2:47:19] <+500_pts> by the fart gas
[2:47:25] <seniormeatbox> pats the poop toots
[2:47:26] <%SirGO0SE> hes blue balling us with flip :(
[2:47:27] <OToole42> I hope not, would be cool to see the other episodes
[2:47:29] <ArkSeaside> he could easily do it in two streams, and I hope he does
[2:47:30] <SulfurousAcid> do big flips pat
[2:47:31] <NewBlood> yeah check the stink lines
[2:47:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Do a 720 no-scope, vertically
[2:47:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Only cowards don't do flips
[2:47:34] <Fenlig> I think theres a secret on the chubby silo
[2:47:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Stop not-flipping
[2:47:39] <seniormeatbox> HE DID THE THING
[2:47:40] <%SirGO0SE> HE DO IT PogChamp
[2:47:42] <%DappercatEsquire> nice
[2:47:43] <+500_pts> if you look by the two jump pads, theres fart gas on a roof

[2:49:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @seniormeatbox Micro Crazy Talk. The intent to look somewhere is predicated on the belief that the goal is there. This triggers Crazy Talk to shift the goal elsewhere. Only when he has given up hope on finding it does its location become stable.
[2:49:49] <+500_pts> yatta

[2:50:58] <geassguy360> the climbing doesn't really work well in the default setu
[2:50:58] <cliffpuncher> Whew boy this is gonna be rough on a controller
[2:50:59] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:51:03] <ArkSeaside> max stumbo
[2:51:03] <%TheBenson8r> That's... hoo boy

[2:51:27] <cipher758> climbo man
[2:51:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> this does not at all look fun on controiler
[2:51:28] <+rosabellamelantha> best track
[2:51:30] <geassguy360> theres a layout that makes climbing easier
[2:51:32] <T_Sasquatch> So many sounds
[2:51:33] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU FOUND JESUS
[2:51:37] <%vermillionzetta> I'm not weak, I'm just high
[2:51:39] <ArkSeaside> us3 the hunting rifle on the welders
[2:51:42] <%Pyroclase> rip
[2:51:47] <Zaranell> It's hard to pick a favorite song from the DUSK soundtrack, but "Burn in Hell" is up there for me
[2:51:55] <%StaceMcGate> were developers obligated to have a controller scheme?
[2:52:19] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> YOOO
[2:52:24] <seniormeatbox> @StaceMcGate nah but its cool of them that they did
[2:52:27] <mattynezz> I take it Pat uses the Shotguns 95% because he "might need ammo later"
[2:52:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> for this? yea lol. accessibility is always good
[2:52:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> well seniormeatbox put it better
[2:52:44] <ArkSeaside> luckily these shotties tear ass
[2:52:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Did he ever find a sword in act 1?
[2:52:58] <geassguy360> yes not everyone can do mouse and keyboard
[2:53:00] <%de1ete_forever> does controller have an aim assist? its hard to tell
[2:53:00] <ArkSeaside> pat hit the yellow door
[2:53:01] <JayEarly> yes patton
[2:53:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea he dod
[2:53:13] <geassguy360> yes theres multiple settings for aim assist
[2:53:18] <%de1ete_forever> ah
[2:53:20] <JayEarly> controller has pretty generous aim assist by default
[2:53:24] <%SirGO0SE> the game im working on now is controller only because i cant think of a scheme that works for mouse and keyboard
[2:53:25] <ArkSeaside> youre the death from above
[2:53:29] <+rosabellamelantha> You were meant to rivet these guys
[2:53:29] <%TheWinged7> DIIIIVE KICKU

[2:54:14] <+AlchemiBeast> a s c e n d
[2:54:14] <%Pyroclase> Or rather story, it's the reveal that this is actually a military base
[2:54:15] <ArkSeaside> return to his home planet

[2:59:47] <cliffpuncher> Looked RIGHT at the vent and didn't shoot it
[2:59:52] <mattynezz> The ability of this game to mesh old school twitch shooters with horror is stellar
[3:00:06] <Bulldrome> You can twirl guns to melee vents
[3:00:07] <geassguy360> yeee

[3:00:11] <%DappercatEsquire> delicious sucret

[3:00:22] <cipher758> vent defeated
[3:00:22] <T_Sasquatch> Wtf are these sounds
[3:00:24] <seniormeatbox> pat type "nbhot" to ruin immersion

[3:00:44] <+rosabellamelantha> We horror now
[3:00:44] <geassguy360> yeah but this is actually effective for modern times which is a feat
[3:00:46] <+cheflul> monkaS
[3:00:52] <+Ez8Razgriz19> its the "portals makes guest characters cannon" discussion
[3:00:53] <+ZedSlayer> Blood can be scary Matty

[3:02:08] <Saltmeisterr> RANDY
[3:02:09] <cipher758> randy "squirttrix" pitchford
[3:02:12] <geassguy360> Civvie's tirade on Randy in his pro duke video is legendary
[3:02:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> you tend to forget how tough these fuckers are
[3:02:14] <%heartlesshealer> Randy's always a bitch
[3:02:15] <seniormeatbox> @PatStaresAt they take 3 ssg/rifle hits have fun
[3:02:17] <%king_wragles> I mean, it was either start another lawsuit he'll lose or get a new flash drive with child "magic" on it
[3:02:19] <+rosabellamelantha> I LOVE the Wendigos
[3:02:27] <%VvTacoSaladvV> The Wendigo scream is some perfect sound design
[3:02:27] <ArkSeaside> bestigos
[3:02:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Randy Bitchturd
[3:02:30] <%KoiRedd> Don't trust your Randy
[3:02:31] <Speccu_> randy is an exploiter, a wage thief, and problay a pedo, someone should use some explosion magic on him
[3:02:37] <%heartlesshealer> It was absolutely "start another lawsuit" this time for Randy Bitchford
[3:02:47] <%BoneofMalkav> What's Randy suing 3D Realms/Apogee for this time?
[3:02:51] <%DappercatEsquire> That 3D Realms thing is weird. On one hand, you're supposedly given an IP with no preexisting deals tied to it, and then that turns out to be wrong. On the other hand, fuck Randy Pitchford.
[3:02:53] <Saltmeisterr> wait whats different between hunting rifle and crossbow?
[3:03:03] <+rosabellamelantha> Crossbow pierces enemies and walls
[3:03:11] <%BoneofMalkav> ^
[3:03:12] <Saltmeisterr> and rifle?
[3:03:16] <geassguy360> yeah it is
[3:03:20] <+rosabellamelantha> hunting rifle hits like a super shotgun but far away
[3:03:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Rifle has good zoom
[3:03:28] <+rosabellamelantha> and has zoom
[3:03:29] <Saltmeisterr> oh
[3:03:32] <Saltmeisterr> neat
[3:03:33] <ArkSeaside> yeah i love that bit with the barrels
[3:03:46] <%DappercatEsquire> red klansman
[3:03:47] <JayEarly> every sound the wendigo makes incites a pavlovian response of me shitting pants
[3:04:11] <+rosabellamelantha> The Wendigos are a good spook
[3:04:16] <+rosabellamelantha> but the horrors in episode 3
[3:04:20] <+rosabellamelantha> FUCK the horrors
[3:04:20] <ArkSeaside> the Duke Wizards slow projectiles are easier to deflect
[3:04:21] <geassguy360> I love how the sound of the wendigo is pretty much literally a scare chord
[3:04:33] <%DappercatEsquire> fuckin jobbers
[3:04:34] <+rosabellamelantha> the horrors legitimately unsettle me
[3:04:37] <%TheBenson8r> oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[3:04:37] <+YabbaTroll> OHF
[3:04:42] <%MayorRev> oh
[3:04:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jayearly Don't be ashamed. Pants shit is just bitch leaving the body.
[3:04:46] <%SirGO0SE> @GeneralSCPatton theres an article by "sienaduplan" if you google degrees of separation with their name that uses the same data structure i did if you want to see a good rep
[3:04:48] <geassguy360> oh yeah the horrors are no joke
[3:04:49] <%MayorRev> oh oh oh

[3:05:37] <JayEarly> Andrew Da God
[3:05:39] <lordchum1150> The horrors are those flowery, really nice, not scary things that are really slow and don’t chase you, right?

[3:07:15] <Bulldrome> This room is so good
[3:07:18] <%heartlesshealer> oh wow a daytime
[3:07:19] <+ROBOSAPION6499> oh sick doom cultists edition
[3:07:23] <Zaranell> @maynardftw The first five seconds of the game consist of the main character pulling himself off of meathooks and then cutting apart three chainsaw-wielding cultists with his sickles
[3:07:27] <%heartlesshealer> SO MANY
[3:07:29] <%kooldude65> Yes, turn the bloom on
[3:07:31] <Bootkiller6> Everyone's coming together to playfully give Pat shit
[3:07:31] <Cherokia666> Half-Life on low-settings
[3:07:32] <ammobasket> quarter life
[3:07:32] <Glassbrain> They were chilling
[3:07:43] <%StooEsq> this wouldn't be out of place in STALKER, either
[3:07:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Try out the bloom
[3:07:46] <geassguy360> Pat you are actually hella competent at skill based shooters. I can watch this and I DON'T get endlessly frustrated.
[3:07:53] <kepitklen> sixteenth life
[3:07:55] <%BoneofMalkav> In the words of John McClain. "Welcome to the party, Pal!"
[3:08:01] <Sir_Dolphinian> we on that gloomwood hype train?
[3:08:13] <Cherokia666> If STALKER was made by Americans and not Ukrainians
[3:08:19] <Speccu_> @geassguy360 each time i see woolie use the blade attachment for balista instead of arbalest i die a little
[3:08:40] <Floofiie> Damn no parries :(
[3:08:43] <%heartlesshealer> good job

[3:09:19] <yorik1> was this game made in 1995?
[3:09:20] <+Javaa01> Also a convenient cracked wall right there in the open
[3:09:25] <cliffpuncher> Learning Colors With Pat™
[3:09:28] <Sir_Dolphinian> games like this always make me feel like the player is running at full gate
[3:09:29] <geassguy360> @Speccu_ Yeeeeaahh.... He's gotten better but its still too rough to watch much of. Still tune in for the lore reactions tho
[3:09:31] <mori1993> There's a bombable wall back there by the yellow key location.
[3:09:42] <Zaranell> @yorik1 No, but it was made to look like it. It was released in 2017.
[3:09:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> turn on bloom for meme
[3:09:51] <%asurite_warrior> You know a butt load of guns seems like a better deal than satan powers
[3:10:03] <%Monkeyweed21> turn bloom on
[3:10:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> So, does this game's soap imply that Mr. Clean is a holy being, perhaps the second coming of Jesus?
[3:10:05] <Speccu_> @geassguy360 i love how doom 2016 was woolie slowely getting better and somehow a lot of eternal feels like woolie forgetting everything and getting worse lmao
[3:10:19] <ArbitraryTA> Why are you playing a retro PC FPS with a controller you fucking monster
[3:10:20] <Glassbrain> The sickles are better than all the guns combined
[3:10:21] <%DappercatEsquire> TURN ON NLOOM
[3:10:22] <Bulldrome> Everyone wants the bloom
[3:10:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bloom

[3:11:10] <%KoiRedd> Are these military dudes or demon cult military dudes?
[3:11:11] <ObsidianDragon86> Awww I missed his reaction to the first Wendigo :_:
[3:11:11] <Glassbrain> Oh my god pat I’m so sorry that the console jitters infected your poor, poor hands.
[3:11:19] <eckskyuucow> Oh yeah, I forget about a lot of what happens in that episode
[3:11:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Turn on bloom
[3:11:34] <ArbitraryTA> As someone who played Blood 2 back in the day watching you play this like it's a PS1 console game is disgusting in a way that I have no words for.
[3:11:36] <Speccu_> but yeah i mainly think the blade attatchment for ballista is mostly useless on nightmare ive tried
[3:11:53] <Cherokia666> Blood 2 was pretty bad, iirc
[3:11:53] <%Faustgesicht> Bloom shall be ignored
[3:11:54] <eckskyuucow> Destroyer Blade is pretty shit
[3:12:01] <ArbitraryTA> Blood 2 was really bad you're not wrong
[3:12:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bloom pat
[3:12:03] <%DappercatEsquire> bloom pls
[3:12:04] <+theodolitejones> Blood 2 was fucking raw
[3:12:10] <Saltmeisterr> although i feel the same way. i can't really watch someone who isn't decently competent at a ganr
[3:12:10] <+Javaa01> It's just misaligned to fuck with you
[3:12:11] <%Mister_McDerp> bloom never FeelsBadMan
[3:12:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Bloom is AMAZING on this level
[3:12:13] <Speccu_> microwave beam actually good just use it like stunbomb
[3:12:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Blooooooooom
[3:12:16] <Saltmeisterr> except Vinny
[3:12:17] <Glassbrain> Every day, countless gamers play retro FPS with controllers.
[3:12:22] <MildMannered_Creighton> Pat, don't give in! No blooms
[3:12:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> i bought myself blood 2 boxed back in the late 90s
[3:12:25] <%BoneofMalkav> Yeah Blood 2 never happened, let's leave it at that ;)
[3:12:29] <Saltmeisterr> its fun to watch Vinny fail
[3:12:31] <%de1ete_forever> you will surely get the bloom
[3:12:32] <%Essixian> ALL HAIL THE GREAT THRESHER
[3:12:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat why no bloom
[3:12:33] <ArbitraryTA> Caleb only had one game
[3:12:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> indeed, shit was fucking raw
[3:12:38] <%ah_clif> ah_clif subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! It's great seeing your videos on youtube, I am crazy and watch you and peach at triple speed there. Can't wait to watch this later at 3x speed

[3:12:54] <+ZedSlayer> now there are two of them
[3:12:55] <Glassbrain> For just pennies a day, you can pay for these poor souls to have keyboards and mice, so they can live in peace.
[3:12:56] <eckskyuucow> Hot take: the Combat Shotgun in Eternal is a meme
[3:13:02] <ArbitraryTA> The best part of Blood 2 is the first episode because they had to make it good for the demo
[3:13:04] <ObsidianDragon86> DO BIG FLIPS PAT!
[3:13:07] <Cherokia666> I still have my boxed copy of Daikatana. My biggest disappointment is that there was no John Romero poster. I'd still have that on my walls
[3:13:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> turn on bloom
[3:13:11] <Saltmeisterr> but sticky bombs tho
[3:13:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Use BlOOM

[4:11:59] <%UvBenServed> LUDICROUS SPEED
[4:12:00] <%AlphaTauri> you gotta absorb content
[4:12:01] <+How2BEpic> 1.5 usually for me depending on the content

[4:12:18] <cipher758> Barry Allen is a fan of yours.
[4:12:18] <%ha2ken> You are a hero
[4:12:19] <pilllowofbees> That guy is working off 3 hemispheres
[4:12:19] <%DesertPenguin> That's a bit much holy shit
[4:12:21] <%vermillionzetta> That's like those people who use those speed reading things
[4:12:21] <wruce__billis> You and Woolie are fucking SLOW
[4:12:23] <%Starotter70> Just got back, ah well
[4:12:24] <%vaporousTippler> Gotta start speaking slowly just to offset them.
[4:12:24] <%SirGO0SE> talk really fast to fuck them over
[4:12:24] <%DesertPenguin> 1.5 is barely tolerable somethings
[4:12:26] <Travmanic> Just speak very slowly so it looks normal to them
[4:12:27] <%Pyroclase> New Blood Interactive
[4:12:30] <SGrim> 2x is fun if I have nothing else to do. I imagine 3 would hold the same value.
[4:12:30] <%terminallyCapriciousz> It looks like you've got some BABY HA-ANDS
[4:12:32] <%Metballs> The devs
[4:12:32] <%DesertPenguin> sometimes*

[4:13:04] <%TheGreatPenor> also pat you get what we were doing you monster
[4:13:04] <geassguy360> Grew up with Keyboard only Doom, Goldeneye and then Halo. Controller is great for shooters and people who hate are just dumb and closed minded
[4:13:05] <%DesertPenguin> Now he's going out of his way to talk fast so it's even faster for that one guy LUL
[4:13:23] <%Invlux> Invlux subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey Pat, someone on the Podcast brought back up the Z-Targetable weakpoint bit on the podcast and it reminded me that I've got some excellent facts saved up about Ileostomies since it's been over a year since I got my own. Stay tuned :)
[4:13:25] <@SoFarFetched> You up the speed once the VOD is up which should be somewhere in settings
[4:13:32] <%Starotter70> Except for smash player
[4:13:37] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhead
[4:13:39] <@SoFarFetched> unless they are doing it through youtube there is also there
[4:13:40] <+colbyninjas> dusk devs twitter is so funny right now
[4:13:42] <NoriBasket> how do I up the speed NOW
[4:13:50] <@SoFarFetched> you can't cause they are live
[4:13:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Throw soap at the Earth for a billion damage to cleanse our impurities
[4:13:56] <%Rumbutt> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[4:14:03] <badzombie28> Need some speed!!!
[4:14:06] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:14:06] <DavidSanChan> pat is barely 3D
[4:14:07] <@SoFarFetched> You can't fast forward real life LUL
[4:14:08] <%de1ete_forever> @GeneralSCPatton don't drop the soap
[4:14:13] <%de1ete_forever> haha kms

[4:14:26] <%DappercatEsquire> restart the stream
[4:14:32] <%BoneofMalkav> Pat was rendered in Vertex Modeling
[4:14:40] <%weissguard> Oh jeez
[4:14:46] <alwayspronking> Tempo is tricky
[4:14:47] <Man_in_the_Red> Soap is the BFG 1000000
[4:14:48] <%Mister_McDerp> mtg only has EDH now
[4:14:50] <Saltmeisterr> tembo is like combo
[4:14:51] <%Valdorick> Its like control, but not.
[4:14:54] <%Ranryu692> Magic has Godzilla cards though
[4:14:58] <%BinaryFireball> It's like midrange but not
[4:14:59] <Paperware> The hidden Donger is the deadliest
[4:14:59] <%Ynkubus18> ITs more mtgs current set is eh
[4:15:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> Tempo means you set up a situation to maintain control of the game and make meaningful plays frequently
[4:15:02] <%Promessa_EX> tempo is spam
[4:15:02] <%SirGO0SE> tempo is playing big shit each turn that is good value for the mana cost
[4:15:03] <%a_goth_pancake> how quick the song is
[4:15:04] <Saltmeisterr> like constant pressure
[4:15:07] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt tempo usually referse to keeping command of board state as opposed to minion state.
[4:15:08] <%xWanderingFlame> psaBlind
[4:15:17] <%AlphaTauri> Tempo is control for people who want to pretend they aren't playing control
[4:15:17] <+Stonehewer> Tempo means you curve out well with generally strong units and win on value before late game
[4:15:19] <%DappercatEsquire> Tempo is immediate, short term control of the game
[4:15:22] <%Invlux> oops
