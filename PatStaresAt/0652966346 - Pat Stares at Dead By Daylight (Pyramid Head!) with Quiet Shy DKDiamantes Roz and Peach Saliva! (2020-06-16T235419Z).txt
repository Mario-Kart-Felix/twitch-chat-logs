[0:29:06] <ThorW> @PatStaresAt if you take self care you usually take Botany knowledge because it cuts healing in half. Standard meta is Sprint Burst/Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, and Iron Will/Spine Chill
[0:29:06] <kindashagg> This is a fun stream
[0:29:07] <madskull456> i prefer spine chill
[0:29:07] <QuietteShy> im thinking Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, And Calm Spirit.

[0:51:57] <Captain_Doomsday> There is no PvP. They're playing in a room

[0:53:42] <+Remery_> I'm pretty sure Huntress has abs just waiting for a skin where she shows it off
[0:53:43] <%Frost_Quill> Because she has good range her terror radius is like that I think.

[0:56:06] <AdjathaTheDrinker> "These flesh blobs gurgled at me and it scared me" - Every reaction to Pat's streams
[0:56:07] <%AncelDeLambert> the big perk for Huntress is the one where the more you hook people the harder skill checks get
[0:56:12] <MyNameIsRasus> @Run44forrest he is and it's fucking funny man
[0:56:15] <CloudCircus> Haha yeah I knew about the lupus @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh

[1:08:44] <gluemanofficial> Doctor be like LUL
[1:08:44] <%shieldecho> Is this session less scary because we're seeing it from the perspective of the killer or because no one's humming anymore

[1:09:08] <%ragingbrachy> is pat a good doc or is this character just dumb as all hell
[1:09:18] <AdjathaTheDrinker> If this were Bioshock, he's be shooting out B E E S
[1:09:19] <leinadtonu> Pat is enjoying himself so much.
[1:09:19] <gluemanofficial> This is more scary because nobody want the Doctor to ara ara them
[1:09:19] <Captain_Doomsday> Everyone is a scrub except Pat and Paige
[1:09:20] <%Frost_Quill> @ragingbrachy More the latter.
[1:09:33] <AdjathaTheDrinker> One of Paige's many, many weaknesses

[1:17:52] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat should have to limit himself to just each killer's native perks
[1:18:08] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Yo Pat, UK mightve found a gamechanger for COVID. "It cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators.

[1:46:36] <%Joustar_> Poor Shy BibleThump
[1:46:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> Why he sword so tiny
[1:46:46] <%curlym0nster> is pat like the silent hill wiki where they both have a weird thing about dicks
[1:46:51] <MayorRev> because if it was bigger it would cover the whole screen
[1:46:52] <%Garthunox> Maps are free DK!
[1:46:52] <$QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:46:53] <SGrim> It's unfair if the killer is good.
[1:46:53] <%Frost_Quill> @namisrot I was just making a joke like he was saying that to avoid something bad, I'll check it out later.
[1:46:54] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:46:54] <%KaiserMario> @Estuko Yeah, kinda like that, I think when you see too much of it, you lose most of the mistery that made them scary
[1:46:55] <%ragingbrachy> heheheh
[1:46:56] <+VoytekBus> welp
[1:47:01] <QuietteShy> i like how my survivor being impaled by all the metal spikes but she just looks kinda bored
[1:47:04] <%cha0tic_klutch> Outstanding move
[1:47:04] <%InugamiTheHound> PH has a reppuken?
[1:47:06] <%CJett92> I dont!
[1:47:08] <Captain_Doomsday> "Symbolism" is shorthand for dicks.
[1:47:09] <Xeno351> i kinda hate how pyramid head is actually fast in this game. i get they need to do it for gameplay but still
[1:47:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I don't either
[1:47:14] <%huskarl_zap> @patstaresat What would you do if Quantum dream bought Castlesuperbeast and you when the AT@T auction that is definitely going to happen soon?
[1:47:16] <%xWanderingFlame> To the shadow realm.
[1:47:18] <+GenesisKnight> You should play DBD with the AH guys sometime, Pat
[1:47:18] <%ElenaManetta> oh shit damn holy shit pat woah damn

[1:47:27] <$Dakuu75> I like how Pyramid Head DOESN'T clean his weapon like all the other killers. he just admires it.
[1:47:36] <%Taisuru> PansexualPride
[1:47:37] <sydowoodo> because it's true lol
[1:47:37] <$QueequegTheater> My Nut is the Nut That Will Pierce The Heavens

[1:47:43] <%valriot> ANAKIS NUTS, ARE IN MY HEART, AND IN MY SOUL
[1:47:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> Just keep saying the feature is broken so the developers nerf it
[1:47:48] <%Frost_Quill> If they wanted a fast Pyramid Head why doesn't he just have his spear?
[1:47:48] <%Starotter70> THESE NUTS WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS
[1:47:49] <%Mendin> Yours are the balls that will pierce her ass
[1:47:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> Just like fighting game fans
[1:47:53] <televisedrevolting> @dakuu75 Certainly got a weapon worth admiring.
[1:47:54] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Reminder that Lordgenome is voiced by Sojiro in the dub and it's great
[1:48:00] <%ElenaManetta> Oh so basically pat has memory advantage

[1:48:05] <Higaraishi> Hey @PatStaresAt thinking about buyng DbD but i got a question, can you buy all the killers and survivorn with in game currency or you NEED to get DLC to play some of them ?

[1:48:36] <QuietteShy> bullshit bm tunneling toxic REPORTED
[1:48:38] <%Garthunox> @higaraishi you need to buy some of em, you cant buy em with in game currency
[1:48:38] <eccentricprinceofroses> this is the downside to de-optimizing perks, it feels even worse when you lose harder than before feelsbadman

[1:48:46] <%huskarl_zap> is it the david cage?
[1:48:47] <%Perky_EDF> Licensed killers have to be bought with money. Original ones can be bought with in game currency.

[1:49:17] <+Remery_> Killing is very soothing
[1:49:18] <+Loinclothiclese> @PatStaresAt will you play heavy rain for us when it comes out on steam? BlessRNG

[2:03:24] <+idyota> you are exhausted while repairing a generator
[2:03:26] <%D00msDayDan> lets you ntr survivors
[2:03:27] <%ABigPinkLion> it's called C U L T U R E
[2:03:28] <%InugamiTheHound> I remember satan has huge floppy dick in Dante's Inferno.
[2:03:29] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's a tag on nhentai
[2:03:30] <%DedlokPM> @patriotrenegade neither does Dwight, but he seems to do just fine. teenIDK
[2:03:30] <%Frost_Quill> Cheryl might actually make me consider playing survivor.
[2:03:32] <televisedrevolting> Ah the greatest of stratagems.
[2:03:43] <%ragingbrachy> monkaS
[2:03:49] <Azathotic> @PatStaresAt Minbreak exhausts everyone who works on a gen thats below 50%
[2:03:50] <Captain_Doomsday> Survivors are just skins. Remember that.
[2:03:50] <Pyx_LocKe> monkaS
[2:03:51] <%ABigPinkLion> monkaS
[2:03:56] <%ElenaManetta> i thought those rumbles were pat's stomach
[2:03:56] <+spaghetti_shaman> Pat is a generator of gens
[2:03:57] <%amiavamp> it's a good thing survivors have the powers of Third Person Camera
[2:03:58] <%optimasmaximas> @InugamiTheHound wait the book or is there some movie that did that shit? LUL
[2:03:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> Splinter Cell
[2:03:59] <Solidnick18> spooky
[2:04:01] <BionicPulga> lol
[2:04:01] <%Rumbutt> Mindbreaker: While repairing Generators IconHelpLoading generators.png with less than 50 % Repair progression, Survivors are afflicted by the Exhausted IconStatusEffects exhausted.png Status Effect. Any existing Exhaustion Status Effect timers are paused while the Survivor is repairing a Generator. After ending the Repair action, the Survivor is afflicted by the Exhausted Status Effect for 1/2/3 second(s).
[2:04:04] <QuietteShy> EVERYONE TRYHARDING
[2:04:08] <%ragingbrachy> thanks rumbutt
[2:04:11] <%gespenst25> can the monster not just open the door?
[2:04:12] <+VoytekBus> this is the most serious game yet
[2:04:14] <Solidnick18> maybe
[2:04:21] <%ragingbrachy> IconStatusEffects
[2:04:25] <eccentricprinceofroses> everyone tryhards when Pat isn't killer that's so mean
[2:04:29] <Azathotic> Sweathoggin
[2:04:32] <%InugamiTheHound> @optimasmaximas in the video game, In gameplay you can see satan's floppy penis.
[2:04:32] <%Frost_Quill> @Captain_Doomsday Yeah but I genuinely can't get into survivor gameplay, and I really like Heather's design.
[2:04:37] <%ElenaManetta> everyone gives up when pat is killer cause he too strong
[2:04:42] <%Joustar_> Everyone is just being the sweatiest sweats right now
[2:04:44] <%ChestMimik> It "exhausts" you when you "use" the "generator"
[2:04:47] <%SinisterBroccoli> do survivors have anything special about them?
[2:04:48] <xeroslash1> he didnt see him!
[2:04:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> This is just unfair and mean

[2:06:03] <%DedlokPM> @SinisterBroccoli no. Only thing they have is the perks, which become shared when they are leveled up to certain levels. Survivors are basically just skins that also have their own individual skins
[2:06:03] <%ChestMimik> Yup that's a monster that would use the mind break tag
[2:06:06] <%Dementedpenguin> @MayorRev yes

[2:12:26] <+waltzqueen> He's not worng
[2:12:27] <%Starotter70> It's ROUGH
[2:12:28] <Captain_Doomsday> Here's DbD's lore: The Entity is soooo strong everything makes sense also everything sucks and it's hopeless play the game.
[2:12:29] <jinshiroi> don't play hd collection
[2:12:29] <%ABigPinkLion> he's right
[2:12:29] <JD_1203> I THINK S1 IS
[2:12:30] <+Eiddew> fog
[2:12:31] <%bendatron> silent hill 3 and 1 are on the classics list i think
[2:12:35] <@Fuggins4U> @wyrdboy21121 PansexualPride
[2:12:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater There is no fog.
[2:12:37] <+WarbossMetal> Didnt Cheryl mason basically create the spooky nightmare version of silent hill? Or was that just the movie... hm
[2:12:37] <%heartlesshealer> Actually ruined
[2:12:40] <%Monkeyweed21> they put the signs in comic sans
[2:12:41] <$QueequegTheater> @LiquidDinosaur WHAT
[2:12:42] <%xWanderingFlame> Why’s it so bad?
[2:12:43] <%ABigPinkLion> one of the games on there is a beta version
[2:12:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> They put their dick in them
[2:12:43] <$QueequegTheater> HOW
[2:12:44] <Naho_Saenoki> Silent Hill 1 was released as a PS1 Classic.
[2:12:45] <$QueequegTheater> WHY
[2:12:49] <kuroshiro_2573> Silent Hill 1 is in the Playstation Classics.
[2:12:49] <%Faustgesicht> alphas marketed as hd
[2:12:49] <Brainworm205> Silent Hill 1 is a PSOne Classic
[2:12:52] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking FOG
[2:12:55] <$QueequegTheater> NO FOG ARE YOU SERIOUS
[2:12:57] <%Spydurman> they lost the code and the company it was outsourced to had to rebuild what they could
[2:12:58] <NeroInfinite> YEP THEY LOST THE ORGINALS
[2:12:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Shithole studio
[2:13:01] <gluemanofficial> The minmo perk is broken IMO
[2:13:02] <majindusto> THE LOST THE SOURCE CODE
[2:13:05] <+Eiddew> how do you just LOSE IT
[2:13:06] <+waltzqueen> AWFUL SFX
[2:13:07] <%amiavamp> The HD collection is full of bugs
[2:13:12] <Alseid> that, and COMIC SANS
[2:13:14] <+WarbossMetal> And then they took out the fog
[2:13:22] <%Dementedpenguin> Konami 4Head
[2:13:23] <VroomSoon> Classic Konami
[2:13:27] <JD_1203> BUT TROY BAKER AS JAMES IS GREAT
[2:13:32] <%ragingbrachy> why would you want to play sh2 without the stilted acting
[2:13:41] <MichaelOfCainhurst> Konami being Konami
[2:13:44] <%amiavamp> And the cutscenes were mocapped by the voice actors
[2:13:50] <MichaelOfCainhurst> And Konami is the worst.
[2:13:55] <NeroInfinite> It was the worst.
[2:13:55] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt TELL THEM ABOUT THE FOG
[2:13:55] <%Monkeyweed21> COMIC SANS AND NO FOG
[2:13:56] <GrandmasterBFunk> Silent Hill chose people who were not proffessional VO's which gave it a charm
[2:13:57] <%ragingbrachy> 🍝
[2:13:57] <%spiritofmojave> Troy Baker is the only solid cast, but still overall blech
[2:13:59] <+Eiddew> Fuckonami
[2:13:59] <%Starotter70> @PatStaresAt Aren't the SH3 old VA still in just volumed down
[2:14:01] <majindusto> YURI LOWENTHAL AS VINCENT enigmaPuke
[2:14:01] <%DedlokPM> @Fooguwu each killer and survivor has their own backstory. As for the game itself, The entity grabs people and killers into their realm and pit them against each other over and over again. After each one the survivors come back to this campfire. Whether they escape or die.
[2:14:02] <+Loinclothiclese> did paige just hurl?
[2:14:02] <+waltzqueen> @PatStaresAt VoidBurger's youtube channel has an interview with the voice director is sh2 and he explains what happened with the legalities of hte voices during HD collection
[2:14:03] <televisedrevolting> The uncanny in their voices wasn't intended, but it definitely added to the odd atmosphere.
[2:14:04] <jellssssss20> Is Paige very far from her mic again?
[2:14:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> Troy Baker is always great, Right. Just put Troy in and the voice is good
[2:14:06] <%huskarl_zap> Hey... ........FREDDYFAZBEAR *JUMPSCARENOISE*
[2:14:07] <%Sausious> didn''t 2 also have issues with the fog?
[2:14:07] <+WarbossMetal> Troy baker was alright tho
[2:14:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Thats how acting works
[2:14:09] <%Perky_EDF> I mean. Konami ripped off how many sources for game covers?
[2:14:11] <Solidnick18> yeah
[2:14:16] <%xWanderingFlame> Konami worse than EA
[2:14:18] <Fien111> They only patched the PS3 version cause patching Xbox cost MONY
[2:14:20] <ScreamLord> I want a new HD release for the Metal Gear games, plus MGS4
[2:14:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Don't cast for the character just put in the Voice actor man
[2:14:30] <%ragingbrachy> now THATS scary
[2:14:30] <majindusto> TROY WAS TRASH IN SH2
[2:14:39] <+turolord> and people want them to remake the game.... oof
[2:14:47] <%de1ete_forever> let's go to Konami Burger and wait for this all to blow over
[2:14:53] <%Starotter70> K O N A M I
[2:14:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> Put in the voicey man make the voicey go.
[2:14:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> AND THE SIGN IS IN COMIC SANS
[2:15:00] <ScreamLord> #Fuckonami
[2:15:02] <+UberWolfman> WHOOPS WE LOST THE CODES
[2:15:03] <+waltzqueen> fucKonami
[2:15:04] <%ragingbrachy> people want konami to make games still i cant believe it
[2:15:08] <%huskarl_zap> You though it was FREDDY BUT NO IT WAS ME, PHONE GUY ALSO KNOWN AS MATPAT!
[2:15:08] <%Monkeyweed21> it was worse than Reforged
[2:15:08] <%thetruenicster> And don't forget about Heather's Blue Boots
[2:15:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> AND DONT FORGET THAT THE SIGN IS IN COMIC SANS FONT
[2:15:10] <%Starotter70> Stream the Pachinko Machine
[2:15:10] <Mr_Strut> That sounds like something that a single playthrough would have revealed
[2:15:14] <%MSN04_Sazabi> Well the problem is that SH2 fog basically only works properly on PS2, for the same reason PS2 can never be properly emulated as well as Gamecube, Wii or (in the future) even PS3/4
[2:15:16] <%gespenst25> This was not a Genius Kojumbo moment.
[2:15:20] <%Perky_EDF> Castlevania 2 is practically traced from Ravenloft.
[2:15:21] <$QueequegTheater> "Let's all laugh at an industry that never learns anything tee hee hee"
[2:15:25] <%ABigPinkLion> Konami should just let behavior make silent hill
[2:15:33] <JD_1203> WHAT DOES CLEANSE TOTEM DO?
[2:15:43] <%Conyst> Pat just have him look up The Real Silent Hill Experience 14a 14b
[2:15:44] <%Frost_Quill> @MSN04_Sazabi The PS2 emulation is actually pretty good nowadays, same with Gamecube.
[2:15:46] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:15:47] <$QueequegTheater> @JD_1203 Removes killer hexes
[2:15:47] <+tangoragahn> What about how SH3 runs at 1/3 the speed it should
[2:15:48] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> That would be shy

[2:16:34] <Azathotic> @cascadepersona PC or console?

[2:16:40] <RunningNGunning> Pat is blind
[2:16:43] <televisedrevolting> You gotta do the RP stare.

[2:16:49] <%Valdorick> range*
[2:16:49] <Captain_Doomsday> @cascadepersona I doubt it's worth it. You can try Identity V to see if you can tolerate the basic gamepaly.
[2:16:49] <%huskarl_zap> Why isnt Patstaresat on HBO MAX?
[2:16:50] <gluemanofficial> At least Paige isn't a coward
[2:16:50] <%Starotter70> Heeee
[2:16:54] <+cascadepersona> @azathotic Most likely PC, although I do have a PS4.
[2:16:55] <+tangoragahn> Or how they changed the Silent Hill Ranch to Comic Sans
[2:16:55] <ScreamLord> @MichaelOfCainhurst But then how will they be able to make Pachinko machines?
[2:16:57] <%tolloponik> geez that the fourth giftsub this week

[2:17:31] <Captain_Doomsday> WHAT A PLAN
[2:17:32] <%ShichiNoBushi> Paige, you can't get off the hook scott free.
[2:17:33] <%Frost_Quill> @LiquidDinosaur Canonically I think the Entity wants them to escape to generate more fear and hope to feed on.
[2:17:33] <%Perky_EDF> I've caught so many people with Ghostface just cause they didn't know he knows where you are if you glance at him.
[2:17:33] <televisedrevolting> Patrick what

[2:19:00] <%DedlokPM> @LiquidDinosaur 1) the hook doesn't pierce anything vital 2) Supernatural entity that acts to put these people and killers in trials and make them more "durable" to last longer 3) even if they "die" they just get sent back to the campfire

[2:19:05] <Azathotic> @cascadepersona Perfect! If you play Killer, level Leatherface to get BBQ and Chili, then pick whoever. Billy, Spirit and Nurse are OP but require lots of skill.

[2:19:36] <+cascadepersona> @azathotic I see, thank you for the advice! I'll watch a bit more and make my decision.
[2:19:38] <Azathotic> @Jeemukun They have the movie Ghostface as a DLC costume and it looks like ass
[2:19:40] <Captain_Doomsday> This Ghostface is a simp for the Entity.
[2:19:41] <gluemanofficial> @Jeemukun The people who own the movie rights dont own the mask rights. Its hilarious
[2:19:43] <%MayorRev> birb
[2:19:49] <%ChestMimik> @televisedrevolting He doesn't really radiate that monster dick energy
[2:19:52] <%Frost_Quill> @Jeemukun There's like five or six Ghostfaces in the movies man.
[2:19:54] <%Joustar_> These survivor's shoulders man
[2:19:54] <%Perky_EDF> They wouldnt give them the rights to the movie one first.
[2:19:54] <KiariMugi> how good is DbD on console

[2:20:17] <%DedlokPM> @ScreamLord yeah
[2:20:23] <%spiritofmojave> @faustgesicht from what I've seen so far don't think so, no
[2:20:23] <namisrot> ghost face was just a couple of edgy teens doing murders
[2:20:24] <%Valdorick> The puns
[2:20:28] <Captain_Doomsday> @KiariMugi I hear DbD is pretty bad on console. Nurse is borderline unplayable, at least. Maybe they got Bill now?
[2:20:29] <%Dementedpenguin> @KiariMugi playing as survivor is fine. Killer has some framerate problems that mess with timing and such
[2:20:33] <$QueequegTheater> @KiariMugi Also, you can plug KBM directly into a PS4 now
[2:20:35] <televisedrevolting> @chestmimik He's all covered up too, so you can't even admire his figure. His ghostly figure.
[2:20:39] <SyLuX45> Ghost face is a social media killer
[2:20:40] <+unreso> could have had Matthew Lillard voice ghost face smh
[2:20:40] <%Perky_EDF> So this Ghostface is literally the costume license.
[2:20:40] <JD_1203> WHAT OTHER KILLERS WOULD BE GOOD FOR FUTURE DLC?
[2:20:42] <Azathotic> Huntress is actually a good starter Killer because of how straight forward her ability is
[2:20:46] <blue6sub6remnant6> Un-bear-able says teddie.
[2:20:46] <%Joustar_> Coward vision
[2:20:58] <%Taisuru> @JD_1203 Mr X/Tyrant/Nemesis
[2:21:07] <JD_1203> OOH YES THATS GOOD
[2:21:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @JD_1203 Pinhead? He's not really a slasher but they could figure something out
[2:21:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Trapper is good too, he teaches map awareness and generator patrols
[2:21:13] <%Frost_Quill> Persona 4 DLC that's literally just Adachi as the killer. Teddie is the survivor.
[2:21:18] <jellssssss20> what is dead hard
[2:21:19] <Azathotic> @JD_1203 I am SHOCKED that Hellraiser Cenobites aren't in the game
[2:21:20] <KiariMugi> shmanks y'all ohnBoss
[2:21:22] <DagumiGoodman> imagine being dead already Kappa
[2:21:28] <%Perky_EDF> I wish they had his original Mori where he uses a Flipphone
[2:21:32] <televisedrevolting> Oh shit Adachi would actually be pretty alright.
[2:21:37] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Frost_Quill PogChamp
[2:21:44] <jellssssss20> @Frost_Quill spoilers dude
[2:21:53] <MichaelOfCainhurst> @Frost_Quill EVERYONE'S THE KILLER, AND I'M A SUPER MARIO
[2:21:57] <%de1ete_forever> abstract daddy pistons
[2:21:59] <%Valdorick> Adachi's power? GUN
[2:21:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh what about PATRICK BATEMAN
[2:22:01] <%Frost_Quill> @jellssssss20 The game is 12 years old man.
[2:22:02] <%Afterman_> the like 15 year old game?
[2:22:06] <gluemanofficial> Hi Pat. I hate fun. Can you play as the legion for me?
[2:22:12] <+cascadepersona> Luigi's Mansion DLC, where King Boo is the killer
[2:22:12] <SyLuX45> Spinechill counters Ghostface pretty hard
[2:22:14] <Azathotic> @jellssssss20 I love that after P4 Arena its impossible to hide the spoilers anymore LUL
[2:22:15] <televisedrevolting> @jellssssss20 Well, to be fair, the game is old.
[2:22:15] <%Taisuru> It just came out Kappa
[2:22:16] <JD_1203> RIGHT?HE WOULD BE GREAT @Azathotic
[2:22:17] <$QueequegTheater> @Frost_Quill And it just came out on PC for a lot of people
[2:22:20] <jinshiroi> It just re-release this week
[2:22:22] <luciferaries> tried this game thanks to you now i'm a killer main too
[2:22:22] <DagumiGoodman> Ayyyy
[2:22:24] <%amiavamp> The game that just came out on Steam and is the most concurrently played JRPG on Steam right now?
[2:22:25] <GrandmasterBFunk> what is DEAD HARD?
[2:22:26] <%Perky_EDF> I get Pat and Woolie not wanting to personally say it, but the game is old as hell.
[2:22:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> Also Ghostface technically not Movie Ghostface
[2:22:36] <%Afterman_> @QueequegTheater not even atlus tries to hide his identity anymore
[2:22:40] <%DedlokPM> @jellssssss20 a perk where you can do a quick burst of speed with iframes when you are in the injured state. Goes on a decently long cooldown that only goes down when you are not running after you use it
[2:22:45] <%Valdorick> PAT
[2:22:47] <Captain_Doomsday> Dead Hard is one of the "distance" perks. It's a Dark Souls iframe burst
[2:22:47] <%ragingbrachy> the nuts? damn
[2:22:48] <%Frost_Quill> @QueequegTheater I genuinely forgot it just came out on steam. Fuck.
[2:22:48] <$QueequegTheater> PAT
[2:22:49] <$LuchaDePucha> pat
[2:22:50] <%ahdurian> PAT
[2:22:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Paaaaat, you make noise when you run!
[2:22:51] <Solidnick18> shy why
[2:22:51] <televisedrevolting> Patrick Bateman would be a good addition as well.
[2:22:53] <%Valdorick> 1
[2:22:54] <%Faustgesicht> Father Gascoigne would be a hilarious killer
[2:22:54] <@StridentSong> @PatStaresAt If you sprint vault windows, it creates a notification for the killer
[2:22:55] <%MonsieurHedge> YEAH BLAME SHY
[2:22:55] <%weissguard> quiettRee
[2:22:56] <%Starotter70> How could shy do such a thing?
[2:23:00] <%AncelDeLambert> HAHAHAHA
[2:23:04] <Maverick2736> it's not *the* Ghostface, it's *a* Ghostface
[2:23:08] <$QueequegTheater> Pat trolling
[2:23:11] <%Joustar_> psaCanada_SG toxic man
[2:23:14] <Captain_Doomsday> I want a monster-y future Dwight to be a Killer.
[2:23:17] <%MayorRev> Pat using next level shame tech
[2:23:19] <%Valdorick> The Claudette perk.
[2:23:20] <YakumoYomi> I can't believe Shy would do such a thing.
[2:23:20] <DagumiGoodman> Yeehaw
[2:23:23] <Azathotic> @GrandmasterBFunk A perk. Hit the Perk button while injured and in a chase and youll dash forward and ignore a hit. But youll be hit with a Exhaustion debuff that prevents you from using stuff like it again until it ends
[2:23:27] <Sir_Dolphinian> all shy has to do is say it wasnt her. thats it. its sooo easy
[2:23:31] <$Wafflum> Pat, you have to play as Dwight to do that Kappa
[2:23:34] <%huskarl_zap> psaWhat_SG

[2:25:06] <+Frost_Quill> @koffeemancer I don't know how they'd do it but a killer that you don't know is the killer until they transform would be cool.
[2:25:07] <Thewoodentree> Oh no, if only it had multiple claws to stab you with.....

[2:56:33] <%Frost_Quill> @ChestMimik Nintendo probably doesn't like people using their games for that kind of stuff in the first place, so it's very unlikely.
[2:56:35] <%huskarl_zap> No she blows
[2:56:35] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this would be scarier if the killer was Shrek
[2:56:35] <CrimsonFox777> Actually, it's the Plague. The NIghtmare is another character.

[3:01:54] <%DedlokPM> @sydowoodo she could, but then pat just runs the other way
[3:01:54] <+Loinclothiclese> @Thorn14 if she drinks from the red puke does more damage.

[3:02:05] <%Frost_Quill> @sjay449 The killer Paige is playing is called The Plague.
[3:02:05] <%holydeviant1> whoops
[3:02:08] <%ChestMimik> How is that a fun fact?
[3:02:09] <heart_ablaze> honestly this is the perfect killer for paige, it even barfs across the room like her
[3:02:09] <$Moave> what about blood pools?
[3:02:12] <+Thorn14> @Loinclothiclese Right so its better to not heal the infectiong at all I hear, because the red barf is OP
[3:02:15] <+Thorn14> or stronger
[3:02:16] <%ragingbrachy> that is pretty fun
[3:02:21] <%ragingbrachy> monkaS
[3:02:26] <%de1ete_forever> i'm eating mint choco chip ice cream in a waffle cone
[3:02:28] <%ragingbrachy> then theyll be gone forever monkaS
[3:02:29] <%sniffy77> is paige gonna draw cute monster girls now and tell everyone gohan sucks balls
[3:02:31] <%ElenaManetta> LOL
[3:02:31] <+Loinclothiclese> @Thorn14 less you can use them all before she grabs it.
[3:02:32] <Captain_Doomsday> Red Barf is a very hard to avoid projectile with no hit cooldown.
[3:02:35] <LoneFonte> @Moave the killer drinks to get powered up
[3:02:38] <+Loinclothiclese> @Thorn14 then they reset
[3:02:48] <+Thorn14> So if she grabs one though?
[3:02:49] <%ragingbrachy> BITCH
[3:02:50] <+Grayhammatter> wow D:

[3:05:54] <gluemanofficial> @dogismorose yeah you gotta let the hooks kill them
[3:05:54] <Naho_Saenoki> @dogismorose The killer puts survivors on hooks to sacrifice them to the Entity.

[3:05:55] <Captain_Doomsday> @dogismorose No, that'd be too fun. You can bring an item to kill outright, but you'll lose points and rank for using it.

[3:49:37] <+OwlLightningMage> All my Wendy's got burned down
[3:49:38] <%Perky_EDF> I like Wendys. They have square meat
[3:49:39] <Profmcstevie> Take the food out, THEN burn it. don't waste food
[3:49:42] <%TigerCatGo> Wendys so gooooood
[3:49:45] <%BubbaRands> Worked at Wendy's too once. Burned it down after month 3
[3:49:47] <PassTheTurkeyLeg> would you rather play silent hill 4 or survive 20 seconds inside a microwave hallway
[3:49:50] <%optimasmaximas> wendy's food good
[3:49:51] <%maskofmichael> Only burn down a Wendy's if they don't have a frosty
[3:49:52] <%ragingbrachy> square meat :)

[3:50:23] <Nomad_Scholar> Wendy's will always have frosties
[3:50:23] <%Zombrocom> That horrible unnatural square meat! Unlike natural round meat!
[3:50:25] <%Cerephesis> Wendy's > McDonalds
[3:50:31] <PassTheTurkeyLeg> we should mail Pat a borger
[3:50:34] <+Ohheyitssean> Wendy's is good but the people who own the ones in my area donate money to bad politicians, so... conflicted.
[3:50:36] <jowi_time> you know what sucks though?
[3:50:38] <%Perky_EDF> The Wendy's over here actually knows how to properly build and wrap a burger so it's not a mess when i open it.
[3:50:53] <%Dodolo212> Wendy's good
[3:50:55] <%Starotter70> Yes
[3:50:57] <AlphaTauri> Not anymore!

[3:50:58] <%Valdorick> That's a rare keeper there, Perky.
[3:50:59] <%Zombrocom> My local wendy's food is garbage though, so yeah
[3:51:00] <jowi_time> Wendy's isnt as widespread as other chains despite being better than all of them
[3:51:01] <%maskofmichael> You do now
[3:51:03] <Chumblago13> luckily the Wendy's in my area sucks so there isn't a debate.
[3:51:04] <PassTheTurkeyLeg> What if this entire chat went to Wendy's
[3:51:05] <%de1ete_forever> we can make it happen, give us time
[3:51:06] <%worldbrand> Not anymore, that donation fixed it
