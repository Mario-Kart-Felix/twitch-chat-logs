[1:19:03] <PhantomMaskJr> Eww really I hate her character
[1:19:03] <+lucaflow> Nico gives no shits
[1:19:04] <NickCaesar7> One of Itsuno's inspirations in creating Nico was also his weird fetish for being scolded by "bad girls".[4] He stated that it would be "cool" to hang out with a girl who is sassy like Nico, who smokes all the time, points out your flaws, and gives you crap when you need it. As such, Nico was never thought out to be a playable character, but instead, someone who tells the player to "man up" and do better.[9]

[1:40:43] <Artista_AF> so, no other way to cycle thru Breakers besides asploding them right? @AngriestPat

[2:31:39] <+Tennochief> I wonder how Artemis got released back into her devil form
[2:31:40] <+LeoStrahl> I think this is the response to everyone saying that Artemis was trash in DMC3
[2:31:40] <%xsnowfox> looks like an awakened one from claymore
[2:31:40] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat the difference is it has rocking titties
[2:31:42] <+Dr_Butthurt_PhD> AngelThump

[2:31:53] <dekkitout> Was that a fuckin' Eva beam
[2:31:53] <gigacanuck> So the real question is how did Urizen get his hands on Dante's Devil Arms? He really needs to do better background checks on the people he sells to.
[2:31:55] <dukenux> like, Seraphim or such
[2:31:55] <wsintai> @Tennochief Probably when Dante sold it for pizza money which is ACTUALLY canon
[2:31:56] <Mangoesarentcats> @maskedriderhero i dont have the willpower
[2:31:56] <%vectorless_peon> 6 winged mermaid angel nice
[2:31:58] <+Qsmash_> looks like something you'd see out of DMC4

[2:57:40] <%jiin6> V is a goth, they are easy to read
[2:57:40] <+namillus> @AngriestPat I think V's style gain is designed around performing multiple finishers in chain, balanced by the risk of enemies recovering from stagger.

[3:02:10] <Amotter> @Exyoh @rufus2k2 fucking badass
[3:02:12] <%Alopekis> Did they call him V just because this is the 5th game?
[3:02:13] <TurtleButter> what is that MGS4 PMC symbol
[3:02:16] <dekkitout> That's a cool skull!
[3:02:16] <+LeoStrahl> V seems like a big fan of house for some reason
[3:02:17] <xtremegamer80> @godsabove HE DOES
[3:02:19] <%Mendin> Blackbird, Danse Macabre, Bald Mountain
[3:02:22] <Varanoo> RORB

[3:02:33] <waifoong98> table hopping for crippled man LUL
[3:02:43] <t0hub0hu> does the jumping feel weighted?

[3:03:05] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Why does the bird even SOUND like Gilbert Gotfried?
[3:03:08] <%SneakTheBeak> apatDab
[3:03:11] <RiverBirch> I get it
[3:03:15] <NumberTooBig> @Punisher329 but Vergil's in the game
[3:03:17] <RiverBirch> V is from DMC Devil May Cry

[3:03:22] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @cymen90 IKR LUL
[3:03:27] <%ThePuddingDead> its great and he rhymes!

[3:03:32] <rufus2k2> He reminds me of Enzo from Bayonetta
[3:03:34] <+chaumiester> How come the Panther doesn't talk?
[3:03:36] <rufus2k2> real New Yawker type
[3:03:36] <+namillus> Griffon is actually Dan Southworth
[3:03:38] <+LeoStrahl> Iago is eternal, this is him after stealing Jafars Magic
[3:03:38] <fairore> sicl
[3:03:39] <%Alopekis> @Punisher329 I don't know. That might be the canon reason, but they totally did it because it was the 5th game and they wanted to be goofy.
[3:03:41] <Varanoo> WORB
[3:03:41] <%lloyddboy> WHAT DO WORBS DO
[3:03:48] <NumberTooBig> @chaumiester he's a dumb kitty
[3:03:48] <+lemonsmcbob> Do you think the reason he's only reading 3 passages is because he's reading the poetry TO the enemies?
[3:03:51] <Punisher329> @numbertoobig o cool I didn’t even know!
[3:03:51] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> does he have a monkey and carpet as well?
[3:03:52] <%Lithdoran> @maskedriderhero This city has been overrun by demons for a MONTH
[3:03:54] <+DeRedBaron> so by the looks of it, the campaign is similar to 4 where you play as some characters at different missions?
[3:03:57] <waifoong98> backfired LUL
[3:04:03] <%xsnowfox> i DO enjoy going hard
[3:04:03] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @lemonsmcbob oh Absolutely

[3:04:20] <Punisher329> @xsnowfox going or getting?
[3:04:25] <+miguelrod777> look at nightmares ass
[3:04:26] <%Alopekis> @lemonsmcbob Maybe he can't actually read and he only reads those lines because they're the only 3 he managed to memorize.
[3:04:31] <%Remery_> That big moldy black nightmare ass
[3:04:35] <RiverBirch> Nightmare is dummy thicc
[3:04:35] <t0hub0hu> who doess the music?
[3:04:35] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat is it explained how the fuck V has DMC 1 bosses?
[3:04:46] <dekkitout> So what's up with his hair 'Tokyo Ghoul-ing' out?
[3:04:48] <Punisher329> Hey it’s that cool @remery_
[3:04:53] <%xsnowfox> @Punisher329 the answer is 'yes'
[3:04:58] <+Evitron1> so what is V's stand named
[3:05:03] <waifoong98> oh god, imagine a Birkin or Mr X skin for Nightmare LUL
[3:05:04] <+namillus> He knows the secrets of binding demons to his body via Ink
[3:05:04] <zerogit> @arfsm95 it is, and it is a massive spoiler
[3:05:04] <+DeRedBaron> welp it's only like 5ish hours away so i can see what everything is like
[3:05:07] <%JoltyJ> ...his hair turns white when he DTs? He IS Donte!
[3:05:09] <%king_chat_dad> is V just playable Magdus?
[3:05:14] <Dio_TR> @arfsm95 they actually do explain it towards the end of the game
[3:05:14] <arfsm95> @zerogit i see, thx
[3:05:16] <rufus2k2> that environment damage
[3:05:17] <+LeoStrahl> Maybe Paige can be Nightmare and Pat can be V? Nightmare is super big and strong and beats the shit out of anytone who trash talks V
[3:05:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout His hair is dyed black. When he summons nightmare he uses the ink in his hair
[3:05:25] <Dragon_Batman> great
[3:05:25] <%king_chat_dad> Mundus
[3:05:28] <person181> he's a big nerd
[3:05:29] <alcors_wisdom> yeah the drop in this song isnt as good as devil trigger
[3:05:33] <%Alopekis> It's because the developers made it that way.
[3:05:33] <%skizzuto> time for looney tunes
[3:05:34] <+black_pariah> this makes me want to check out chaos legion
[3:05:35] <%Remery_> Need a Elmo mod for thepanther

[3:05:38] <%ThePuddingDead> Paige is NOWHERE that thicc
[3:05:38] <mayorrev> pew pew pew
[3:05:39] <DracaenaLeaf> Ege chill
[3:05:40] <gigacanuck> @arfsm95 I dunno yet, but my money is him being Mundus
[3:05:41] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @angriestpat does he have a monkey and carpet summon?
[3:05:41] <KaptainKappathe5th> hes a pokemon trainer who got transported to the dmc world and figured out his pokeballs work on demons
[3:05:42] <%SergeantSov> Time for Slapstick
[3:05:42] <DracaenaLeaf> Ede*
[3:05:42] <+LeoStrahl> Also, I'm sticking with Black Parade for V's stand name
[3:05:43] <dukenux> How many red english phone booths still have phones?
[3:05:44] <%JoltyJ> No, Pat is Griffon, Nightmare is wearing a Steve Buscemi Mask
[3:05:44] <Dragon_Batman> Hell yea

[3:21:39] <Varanoo> BLORB
[3:21:43] <+Higgsworth> Do you think this could this be a contender for GOTY? @AngriestPat
[3:21:47] <kingdomkey92> As good as Devil Trigger is Crimson Cloud get's better and better after every listen
[3:21:52] <Lazyturd> Man V combo videos are gonna be sick
[3:21:54] <+LeoStrahl> Because they only fight in... DEMONstrations! (Thank you, thank you)
[3:21:54] <+j_feezyy> @AngriestPat How long is each character's campaign generally?
[3:21:55] <+libra_zero> I dunno that looked pretty devastating to me
[3:21:58] <Lazyturd> I can already see the potential
[3:21:59] <suikudo> I bet if you played V on a fight stick you can get some wild shit
[3:22:01] <+namillus> They're not complete demons as part of the ritual V did to bond them to his ink
[3:22:13] <+Shadicara> Hard to be upset about the download bricking it though. Means everyone is buying it so we can get more DMC LUL
[3:22:22] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Did you know there's a prequel novel Pat?
[3:22:23] <+moondog_> @AngriestPat Do you guys only record at Woolie's place for WOOLIE VS stuff or yours too?

[3:22:42] <+Dobakius> @AngriestPat are you on console or pc?
[3:22:43] <waifoong98> Devil Arms, git it? Kappa
[3:22:46] <etalmeta> The demons' attacks seem to deal metaphysical or mental damage to the other demons, V uses the cane to deal the physical damage needed to finish them.
[3:22:50] <DatAsuna> tell that to sterling
[3:22:52] <Hammerknife> i dunno how i would feel about a remade game being GOTY
[3:22:55] <%MagickBurritoh> PORB

[3:25:35] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat nightmare is a cinematic demon, that's it
[3:25:39] <etalmeta> @StrawberryPantsu it's only due to V's nature that his demons can't kill

[3:26:39] <+MrN64> @garfgarog either order works - if you won't mind adjusting to 1's older combat I'd say doing 3>1>anime>2>4>5 gives some nice context to some things

[3:34:38] <pectusumbra> I fully look forward to the part where V fights Dante and dante styles on Shadow
[3:34:40] <arsonistdaria> yo pat I didn't see it in the settings earlier but does the game have an RE2 way to tell you how your system is handling graphics
[3:34:41] <%mastertwin2> Did he fuckin say BLAST?
[3:34:41] <+zaworldo> So Urizen beat dante and is turning his weapons BACK INTO DEMONS?!?! @AngriestPat

[3:40:33] <%valachi> @libra_zero Nah the horse is obviously gonna be used for Nero's timestop arm
[3:40:35] <%skizzuto> five if you count the knight and the horse as separate

[3:59:43] <TurboMuffin89> trying to avoid this shit until tomorrow but I can't help myself.
[3:59:43] <Hyphixsys> Not playable BibleThump
[3:59:44] <+DashXero> I wish Trish and Lady were playable...
[3:59:45] <Hammerknife> 100% chance they're in bloody palace
[3:59:49] <+namillus> There is no boss rush in 5, the game itself IS a Boss Fight
[3:59:50] <+libra_zero> DMCVSE
[3:59:55] <MyDarkStorm> oh
[3:59:57] <%xsnowfox> bayo's train station got FUCKED
[3:59:57] <alwayspronking> *Nero in the distance
[3:59:57] <+fakelines96> Do you plan on playing the full game tonight?
[3:59:58] <MyDarkStorm> Nero
[3:59:58] <jubejube56> WAAAH
[3:59:59] <billiyjoe_jimbob> give me vergil :(
[4:00:00] <megakruemel> Lady better be playable
[4:00:00] <iaracatunda> didnt they anounce no dlc?
[4:00:02] <+Mrkel90> Is that a nero i hear?
[4:00:04] <Turtleomertle> *Nero sounds in the distance*
[4:00:05] <%ThePuddingDead> then why give them unique color changes if u cant play them?
[4:00:05] <TheJustGordo> Fallout vibes Kappa
[4:00:06] <Hammerknife> trish, lady, arkham, lucia, and donte in bloody palace
[4:00:07] <h33lbr1ng3r> which mission is this?
[4:00:10] <NumberTooBig> 4 hours left
[4:00:12] <+RogueCrocodile> Maybe 2 or 3
[4:00:12] <%ThePuddingDead> that makes no sense
[4:00:13] <majindusto> Special Edition patch
[4:00:14] <gigacanuck> okay chat, so.....which character would say "begone, thot" to Nevan......Vergil or Nero?
[4:00:20] <+CourageTheCat> @AngriestPat is this a combat ajudicator?
[4:00:24] <+Mrkel90> Donte is already in the game as a skin dante has
[4:00:26] <+namillus> Also, I'm pretty sure V's Ride Of The Valkyries taunt is him conducting along to SPONTANEOUS manifestation of the song.
[4:00:27] <%ThePuddingDead> V
[4:00:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Teasing me with Lady and Trish in Dante's first trailer and now they're gonna blue balls me. 😡
[4:00:29] <%xsnowfox> vergil already says 'begone' so
[4:00:38] <%maskedriderhero> Daddy Nightmare save me!
[4:00:38] <gigacanuck> @Hammerknife you must be jesting about Donte
[4:00:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Any super rough idea how far you are into the game? (Percentage wise or hours / gameplay wise.)
[4:00:40] <$Kenzo2000> Starring Devil May Cry, Directed by Hideo Kojima
[4:00:45] <Artista_AF> i hope there's a mod that replaces Nightmare with Mr X LUL
[4:00:57] <rekinom> (Aggressively reads poetry at you)
[4:00:59] <SomeAsianDood> no. Thomas the tank engine Kappa
[4:01:02] <NumberTooBig> @Artista_AF all he needs is a hat
[4:01:07] <billiyjoe_jimbob> what does reading do?
[4:01:07] <Jontman42> !uptime
[4:01:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 1m.
[4:01:08] <%Mendin> V is so goth that his last shit sacked the city of Rome
[4:01:13] <%ThePuddingDead> this is only mission 7
[4:01:16] <MyDarkStorm> there 20
[4:01:16] <+peri_d0t> @artista_af that would be fucking fantastic
[4:01:17] <%0dokuro> John Cena mod for Nightmare when
[4:01:17] <%ThePuddingDead> fuckin jeez
[4:01:21] <h33lbr1ng3r> thanks
[4:01:23] <televisedrevolting> @billiyjoe_jimbob Recharge DT
[4:01:25] <Mr_Loboto> I can see having no dt and both summons drop would spell doom, to balance V's power
[4:01:28] <NeroCapone> how rough are ye?
[4:01:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat For only this character? Damnit I'm SO LATE D:
[4:01:28] <NumberTooBig> TANK mod for nightmare when
[4:01:33] <+libra_zero> wow I can't believe that Gilgamesh fight was an entire mission
[4:01:37] <Cymen90> SEEMS AWFULLY SHORT - Spoiled Gamers
[4:01:38] <VritraReiRei> @easleytr in case you didn't get a real answer to your question. That picture frame of Steve Buscemi was sent to the Best Friends when they were doing mailbag. Why? I guess because it would be funny to send to a group of youtubers who maybe talked about him a few times. Guess Pat was the one of the bunch that decided to keep it
[4:01:40] <Finaldragoon> 21! doodKen doodFive
[4:01:42] <Overloard> mr x mod for nightmare when?
[4:01:43] <Valdorick> @Mendin that's a pretty good visual of a goth, and kinda, Visagoth.
[4:01:48] <pinpopy> @AngriestPat Are you happy with how V turned out? Do you think he's too easy to use, or has some faults?
[4:01:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is it 20 missions total for all characters?
[4:01:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 1 dollar, 1 hour
[4:01:55] <billiyjoe_jimbob> it was kind of lame boss fight
[4:02:01] <danknugglit> How does muliplayer work?
[4:02:03] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> This is mission 7? That means something epic is about to happen if the old game structure rings true here.
[4:02:12] <dukenux> give or take 12 hours of the game, judging from Pat's strean
[4:02:12] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat dOES dante have any missions?
[4:02:16] <joniroquai> Too many devils, not enough crying 7/10
[4:02:17] <%SrG00SE> hes like a new game
[4:02:22] <+namillus> @Professor_Dr_Muffins According to Itsuno, the Real Plot starts at Mission 12.
[4:02:23] <Madnoob23> @AngriestPat Given the opportunity, Would you date V?
[4:02:24] <%xsnowfox> how long did it take you to get used to V's moveset....?
[4:02:28] <$ooblagis> @AngriestPat So the big question. Who is your favorite character to play as?
[4:02:37] <waifoong98> We need Carl Clover in this game Kappa
[4:02:39] <MyDarkStorm> Balance
[4:02:40] <%px120> He straight up plays by different rules compared to the others
[4:02:42] <%Jordevio> So like you wouldn’t get in trouble for streaming the entire game before tomorrow since it’s technically out in some regions?
[4:02:45] <alcors_wisdom> always buff up avoid nerfing
[4:02:47] <+fakelines96> @AngriestPat Is the stream a full play through tonight, or spread out?
[4:02:48] <Shishi1205> Dante has missions for sure if pat takes care of them in the lp and he said he played some hours on that lp
[4:02:49] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat So you're saying that V is the good version of Carl Clover.
[4:02:52] <dukenux> V brings balance to the force
[4:02:54] <NumberTooBig> he's how Zato 1 should be, a bitch to use but it'll be worth it... hopefully Kappa
[4:02:54] <+Mrkel90> in the future you play as jester in the bloody palace
[4:02:54] <+Lolo27234> i think with his wierd play style its fine hes alittle over powered
[4:02:57] <Hammerknife> he has a preview code, no way he'd get in trouble on launch day.
[4:02:57] <Tha_Mik> Savage
[4:03:05] <%MagickBurritoh> !uptime
[4:03:06] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 3m.
[4:03:08] <Hammerknife> unless capcom does an atlus
[4:03:13] <%snarf8122> @AngriestPat DE Steve has a Larger Stream then you :P
[4:03:13] <+namillus> For those of us who are spoiled, it also makes TOTAL SENSE how powerful V is.
[4:03:14] <dukenux> In the DLC you play as Crew Cut
[4:03:21] <waifoong98> @drfaustisdead but he is good...
[4:03:27] <+Exyoh> Pat already beat the game a few times off-screen. Him & Woolie are 75% done recording the LP, and the first ep came out today
[4:03:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Jordevio He has permission, as does most of the people in the Devil May Cry 5 twitch list. So, no
[4:03:29] <%Lithdoran> Taunt!
[4:03:37] <%JoltyJ> Crew Cut is the Hunk of DMC
[4:03:37] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat How does Rorbs work between characters? Share? They have their own pool?
[4:03:41] <waifoong98> @namillus yeah saw that
[4:03:49] <godsabove> which one is tapdancing
[4:03:50] <Vohs_Bru> V foe Wagner!
[4:03:52] <alwayspronking> Is Pat super good or is S rank easy to hit with V?
[4:03:55] <Mr_Loboto> @AngriestPat V is also the only character who could be totally powerless with no dt and summons egged
[4:03:55] <+Midnight_Fondler> They made sure that getting good at V payed off.
[4:03:55] <Shishi1205> share
[4:03:55] <+Manofsalt> What's the name of his bird?
[4:04:01] <%Lithdoran> Griffon
[4:04:02] <%JoltyJ> Griffin
[4:04:04] <jubejube56> I recall V being able to throw canes in the trailer, is that an expensive skill?
[4:04:05] <%JoltyJ> on*
[4:04:06] <$drfaustisdead> @waifoong98 I know just playing on Pat's BB hateboner.
[4:04:06] <+DevinMayCry> Griffon. Like the DMC1 boss.
[4:04:12] <%DedlokPM> @Manofsalt Griffon
[4:04:12] <Hammerknife> @alwayspronking he's been playing this game every day for the last week and a half
[4:04:13] <SomeAsianDood> @jubejube56 yes
[4:04:15] <+bubbli97> !uptime
[4:04:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 4m.
[4:04:19] <%Lithdoran> His birb is Griffon, his catte is Shadow, and his golem is Nightmare
[4:04:19] <waifoong98> @drfaustisdead ah fair enough
[4:04:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Think you enjoyed RE2Re more than this? Or are they on par with each other? I'm hoping RE2Re gets GoTY. This looks fun as hell, though. :) (I know you're only 7/20 missions in, just asking thus far.)
[4:04:24] <+DevinMayCry> See that move there was straight up an attack Griffon did in 1
[4:04:26] <Hammerknife> so he's probably learned it through
[4:04:27] <+Exyoh> Griffon, Shadow & Nightmare are all the DMC1 goons
[4:04:27] <laymanx> I love Pats cute chubby belly
[4:04:29] <%SergeEXE> Have Expectations been Exceeded?
[4:04:30] <+namillus> Like, V is A Human. Humans have more potential than demons in DMC, explicitly because they Care About Shit. On top of that, V has [REDACTED].
[4:04:31] <billiyjoe_jimbob> shadow is such a cool concept
[4:04:40] <+Mrkel90> dude Griffon flat out has whats his name's attack from DMC 1
[4:04:44] <Cymen90> WHAT
[4:04:49] <Trajanic> D:
[4:04:49] <Shiranui24> wow
[4:04:49] <%AncelDeLambert> now THAT'S heavy praise
[4:04:49] <$drfaustisdead> WOW

[4:04:53] <Tucker0603> WOW
[4:04:55] <waifoong98> friendship ended with RE2make Kappa
[4:04:57] <%px120> That's a STATEMENT
[4:04:57] <joniroquai> It's that good?
[4:04:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> EXCEEDED
[4:04:59] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Cant really compared
[4:04:59] <thebehatted> EXCEEDS
[4:04:59] <mayorrev> FAKE FAN
[4:05:00] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, buying this later next week

[4:05:06] <Fujiwara_92> EXCEED
[4:05:06] <SsHomes> damn pat
[4:05:06] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> They are two different games
[4:05:07] <%starotter70> Oh my
[4:05:08] <Jontman42> EXPECTATIONS EXCEEDED
[4:05:08] <+masker101> does it exceed? Kappa
[4:05:09] <Hammerknife> well the problem is that remakes are *remakes*, not original games. there's an upper limit to how good a remake can be
[4:05:09] <+This_is_Marco> Literally exceeded expectations?
[4:05:09] <Dragon_Batman> It is fair
[4:05:09] <SomeAsianDood> EXCEEDS
[4:05:09] <alwayspronking> You mean it..... EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS
[4:05:10] <Zombrocom> Did it EXCEED your exppectations?
[4:05:10] <%0dokuro> you heard it here folks
[4:05:10] <Mr_Loboto> Woah
[4:05:11] <NumberTooBig> EXCEED
[4:05:12] <Tha_Mik> RE2 is based of another game
[4:05:12] <Etherealizer> But did it EXCEED your expectations?
[4:05:12] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat EXCEEDS ALL EXPECTATION!? rooPog
[4:05:12] <$drfaustisdead> Expectations exceeded.
[4:05:13] <%Mendin> Hey @AngriestPat What are your thoughts on the new DbD Killer?
[4:05:13] <thesaintfkz> EXPECTATIONS EXCEEDED
[4:05:13] <+RedXXX00> wow
[4:05:14] <+trekkie11041> @Mrkel90 griffon has griffons attack lol
[4:05:15] <dukenux> Fair
[4:05:15] <Thoravis> this is actively pushing the formula forward
[4:05:15] <Valdorick> I mean, lets be honest guys, RE2 doesn't have the Zapping System... BUT THIS ONE DOES!
[4:05:15] <+Robopengy> V's one weakness, STAIRS
[4:05:15] <dking0000> Expecatations SURSASSED
[4:05:15] <waifoong98> the fuck is SH4 shit LUL
[4:05:16] <rideroftraps1> Max act
[4:05:16] <dosan121> would you say it, exceed your expectations?
[4:05:16] <NeroCapone> EXPECTATION = EXCEEDED
[4:05:17] <AMajorTom> Expectations exceeded
[4:05:17] <%xsnowfox> ....it's true, but still, damn
[4:05:18] <Shiranui24> @AngriestPat would you say it exceeds expectations?
[4:05:18] <Mastigias> EXPECTATIONS EXCEEDED
[4:05:18] <zerogit> Isnt Resident Evil 2 your favorite resident evil?
[4:05:19] <gk1llah> surpassed all expectations? rooSmug
[4:05:20] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Exceeded all expectations
[4:05:20] <Artista_AF> so you can say it EXCEEDS all your expectations
[4:05:22] <%SrG00SE> that remake is of your favorite game of all time isnt it
[4:05:23] <%mastertwin2> Itsuno was right
[4:05:23] <%senfood> Huh. So it literally exceeded his expectations.
[4:05:25] <CrystalLightPeachTea> CLOCKTOWER
[4:05:26] <Jakeofalco> Just like god of war
[4:05:26] <peanutdot007> High praise
[4:05:26] <%px120> That's fair
[4:05:27] <%DedlokPM> Pat posted a picture where he played RE2 for 30 hours and DMCv for 44
[4:05:29] <%ThePuddingDead> HEY Kool AID!
[4:05:29] <SourceHorse> that makes sense
[4:05:29] <Kaitepaints> So the edge works
[4:05:30] <Dragon_Batman> That alittle weird but fair
[4:05:33] <blackdragonz> so pats expectations= EXEEDED
[4:05:34] <+paladinstarbuster> THICC
[4:05:37] <Vohs_Bru> V is basically Soundwave
[4:05:40] <Pajex_> 🤔
[4:05:41] <straight_up_garbage> did the demons make all the escalators go down?
[4:05:41] <Varanoo> NOVELTY POWER
[4:05:43] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat So would you say that RE2 is the game you wanted and DMC is the game you had no idea you wanted
[4:05:43] <Overloard> expected nothing and delivered more PogChamp
[4:05:44] <+Shastafield> PogChamp
[4:05:44] <Hammerknife> between RE2RE and a RE8 that was identical in quality, RE8 would be obviously more wanted
[4:05:48] <%AncelDeLambert> how on Earth are there already so many children of Sparda?
[4:05:48] <iaracatunda> v gameplay looks so chaotic
[4:05:49] <+Midnight_Fondler> They're really not comparable to begin with so.... What?
[4:05:50] <%px120> Also, my god Nightmare is just busted
[4:05:50] <Kaitepaints> @peachsaliva sup gurl
[4:05:50] <disister1201> But it just a worse DmC:Devil may Cry Kappa
[4:05:50] <dukenux> So that year in gaming is already saved for you LUL
[4:05:53] <+Shastafield> LUL
[4:05:53] <%0dokuro> oh no
[4:05:56] <UnderpaidBob> I wish V had a parry
[4:05:57] <%AncelDeLambert> We're reaching peak Sparda density, here
[4:05:57] <waifoong98> Oh man, Pat is finally playing Silent Hill 4 LUL
[4:06:00] <Hammerknife> remakes have a minimum amount of laziness associated with them
[4:06:01] <billiyjoe_jimbob> LUL
[4:06:04] <%ElenaManetta> But how often have you been fantasizing about DMC5 vs. RE2:Remake prior to them being announced?
[4:06:06] <danknugglit> Dmc IS technically RE
[4:06:09] <MaverickHaunter> it seems that stylin' with V is really easy
[4:06:09] <+Mrkel90> there is so many References from all the games @AngriestPat
[4:06:11] <KaptainKappathe5th> we keep getting really close to what looks like could be a SSSS
[4:06:13] <%AncelDeLambert> This is like Dragon Ball, there's too many Saiyans!!
[4:06:25] <scottycanes> So DMCV is the opposite of the SBFP channel? Exceeds all expectations and doesn't make Woolie sad on camera?
[4:06:35] <hotrax> @AngriestPat is V that easy or pat just that good
[4:06:41] <Shishi1205> oof
[4:06:42] <+Midnight_Fondler> The cat's a Displacer Beast?
[4:06:44] <billiyjoe_jimbob> @AngriestPat was this game worth waiting for this long ?
[4:06:44] <iaracatunda> does v have a dodge?
[4:06:44] <dukenux> V is strong
[4:06:48] <$castcode> lol
[4:06:49] <TurboMuffin89> so these demons are basically pokemon
[4:06:49] <+Ninja_Kareca> Those V finishers remind me of Ninja Gainden Sigma
[4:06:49] <%Lithdoran> @scottycanes LUL
[4:06:54] <Vohs_Bru> @Deagle117 Welcome to the Ginger Show
[4:06:59] <%Lithdoran> @iaracatunda Yes
[4:07:03] <SsHomes> V is easy since you can do gun and sword weapons at the same time
[4:07:04] <DatAsuna> both
[4:07:07] <123456789101112131415161> V has a lot of AOE i guess
[4:07:10] <NickCaesar7> @angriestpat which do you like more? persona 5 or DMCV
[4:07:12] <%xsnowfox> american distance amounts
[4:07:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Remake 2 was probably going to happen since Remake 1. DMC V wasn't rumored until Southworth dropped the ball in 2015
[4:07:13] <Hammerknife> how are these escalators still running
[4:07:14] <+namillus> @iaracatunda V's best evasive options rely on his Familiars, so they're good but can be unreliable
[4:07:16] <%xsnowfox> shit's real, yo
[4:07:18] <%foreverN2dust> V is a huge coward and doesn't fight for himself. This is inline with Pat
[4:07:20] <+Exyoh> He's already done, like, 50 hours on this behind the scenes
[4:07:21] <Jontman42> How much is that in metric practise
[4:07:22] <%LouieRouie> I can dig it
[4:07:22] <lbrownthedestroyer> Pat when did Chaos Legion 2 come out?
[4:07:22] <+This_is_Marco> @AngriestPat Could bayo 3 compete in the same style?
[4:07:23] <joniroquai> Seems that the key to playing V is making sure he's in a good position before going all out with attacks
[4:07:29] <%lloyddboy> Pat is STREETS AHEAD
[4:07:30] <+VektorTroika> you're lightyears ahead of Brock?
[4:07:31] <%laserbeaming> Imperial Distance even! What's that in KM?
[4:07:33] <sileo_patronus> lightyears
[4:07:34] <+peri_d0t> @this_is_marco I hope so
[4:07:37] <%ThePuddingDead> Whoopsie Goldberg!
[4:07:39] <TangledVirus> @AngriestPat compared to DMC 5 how do you think Bayo 3 will turn out?
[4:07:45] <+namillus> @joniroquai That tracks with most of his moves having chess-themed names.
[4:07:47] <%DedlokPM> So so in other words you are doing the Kessel Run in 12 Parsec, @AngriestPat
[4:07:48] <iaracatunda> GOD i want bayo3
[4:07:50] <%Lithdoran> @AngriestPat Wait, I just noticed, does this game not have vital stars/other consumable items?
[4:07:54] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Legitimately super happy for you that you have open communication with Capcom. :) I pre-ordered RE2Re Deluxe, and I'll be picking up DMC5 *exclusively* because of your streams. Let them know that, if it matters. (Also I convinced 2 friends to get RE2Re, as well, so you're an "influencer". lol)
[4:07:56] <+Mrkel90> God damn now im thinking how Bayo 3 is
[4:07:57] <UnderpaidBob> yeah holy crap bayo is going to have to be a banger and a half
[4:07:57] <Mastigias> WAIT HOW

[4:08:06] <+Sp3ctre48> I hope Bayo starts doing multiple characters eventually
[4:08:06] <Warbot40> Bayo needs more proper playable characters.

[4:27:04] <Ner234> Never been this hard
[4:27:06] <MaKu2K> game sound is louder than your microphone
[4:27:06] <%px120> Tomboy is STACKED

[4:27:21] <Dragon_Batman> fucking awesome
[4:27:22] <beefomkers> Tom boy is big, very strong. Good shit.
[4:27:24] <TurtleButter> actual best arm
[4:27:24] <%ThePuddingDead> i love how he handles it like a guitar
[4:27:24] <%xsnowfox> oh that's hot.
[4:27:24] <Overloard> YOOOO
[4:27:25] <%0dokuro> I really like Nero's moveset
[4:27:29] <%Agent_For_Hire> tomboy is fukin busted
[4:27:30] <derovell> does buster arm still have unique animations for each enemy?
[4:27:32] <+namillus> Tomboy's Break Age effect is "the base effect sticks around longer and the arm can't break until the end of the effect"
[4:27:35] <wsintai> Tom Boy is also best tag
[4:27:37] <televisedrevolting> As usual, Tomboys are top tier.
[4:27:37] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Octocon) (warning)
[4:27:38] <dukenux> Strong tomboy gf kreygasm
[4:27:41] <iaracatunda> Nero for smash ultimate
[4:27:44] <Zombrocom> Alright I think it's confirmed, Tomboy is the best arm
[4:27:48] <suikudo> So tomboy is the straight up strongest arm in the game
[4:27:52] <+DrShmoo> How come he is picking up arms? if he started with a full set would he not be able to do that?
[4:27:56] <Stardustphantom97> Is Helter skelter any good?

[4:27:57] <%SrG00SE> is this game better than christmas?

[4:28:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How do you know all this shit? Pre-stream practice? Capcom coach you? lol Or just a lot of research?
[4:28:30] <derovell> charged up buster arm is essentially DT buster, right?
[4:28:33] <+VektorTroika> most risk, biggest reward
[4:28:35] <HebbieJebbies> @AngriestPat Would you consider TomBoy to be a more traditional Dante style "DT"?
[4:28:37] <%ThePuddingDead> punchlines fun from what i've seen
[4:28:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @FirearmsInstructor 40 hours last week
[4:28:39] <+namillus> "So, uh, Nero has an arm free during this. And he has a big handcannon."
[4:28:39] <Fujiwara_92> NEVER GET HIT PAT Kappa

[4:29:12] <Rincewind1998> To be fair, Pat is the same guy who said Spiral from DMC3 sucked, when it's actually super broken
[4:29:13] <h33lbr1ng3r> so can we officially declare this the best hack and slash game now? :)
[4:29:19] <%foreverN2dust> With tomboy you'll never be ashamed of people saying your right hand is your girlfriend.

[4:29:24] <$HentaiSenpai9K> He beat 3 times off stream
[4:29:26] <%DedlokPM> @FirearmsInstructor He gotan early review code for it from Capcom. He's played it for 50 hours already before today's stream

[4:31:05] <derovell> what does the charged buster do exactly?
[4:31:05] <+AndeOneNine> @AngriestPat Can you do that with a level 4 gun?
[4:31:06] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> You can hear V!
[4:31:07] <Hammerknife> @ZeOrbling i thought the jojo BR turned stands into guns
[4:31:08] <Nugaze> How do you get it back after it breaks
[4:31:11] <+Thesaltt> why are all the escalators DOWN escelators?
[4:31:12] <freedomboyz> best DMC???
[4:31:14] <AlertDOTEXE> what platform is this on?
[4:31:22] <etalmeta> @MisterRockett yes, it's named because the grab in 4 is "buster"
[4:31:25] <Hydrapissed> ps4 xbox pc
[4:31:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @alertdotexe all of them
[4:31:28] <nobody12349> !uptime
[4:31:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 31m.
[4:31:29] <iaracatunda> wait do you have to do this mission with both characters?
[4:31:35] <%JoltyJ> @Nugaze either find more in the level or buy them from nico
[4:31:42] <NumberTooBig> @AlertDOTEXE Wonderswan
[4:31:42] <%ThePuddingDead> so whats rawhide?
[4:31:42] <%xsnowfox> he's playing on steam with a ps4 controller tho
[4:31:47] <HebbieJebbies> @AngriestPat Is the exceed revving when you make contact with the enemy or when you swing the sword?
[4:31:48] <+TomServal> @alertdotexe Pat's on pc right now.
[4:31:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @freedomREMM Only DMC 3 had a full development cycle. Until 5. So, yes
[4:31:49] <+namillus> Yeah, like I said. "Nero has a hand cannon to use while he's grabbing people"
[4:31:50] <Sajallday> What's best way to time exceed?
[4:31:50] <AlertDOTEXE> thanks, I meant what version pat is playing
[4:31:51] <+zaworldo> What does Rawhide do?
[4:31:52] <bestwaifuritsu> damn, wouldve loved to see what a Buster grab on a sin scissors looked like
[4:31:54] <smward87> no, Pat just is for the sake of completion @iaracatunda
[4:31:59] <bazz_tv> what does the breaker move does with the buster arm?
[4:32:00] <AlertDOTEXE> Thanks you all
[4:32:03] <iaracatunda> ooh ok
[4:32:03] <Hyphixsys> OOMF
[4:32:04] <Nugaze> @joltyj Ahh, thanks man
[4:32:06] <bestwaifuritsu> rawhide is the one that flails the whip around
[4:32:08] <%JoltyJ> np
[4:32:12] <%ZeOrbling> @Hammerknife youre probably right i havengt looked into it much. but it SHOULD have ben character action haha
[4:32:13] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat These enemies look like the cop's jaw / face in the west hall licker room that you crouch to inspect!
[4:32:14] <%SergeEXE> This game is gorgeous
[4:32:22] <+namillus> As far as I know, the Break Age for the Buster is DT Buster grabs.
[4:32:25] <iaracatunda> wow this boy is drenched in blood huh
[4:32:27] <%xsnowfox> i love that nero sounds as excited as i feel rn
[4:32:32] <+zaworldo> What does Rawhide do?
[4:32:32] <%Tarcanist_> LUPUS MAY CRY 5 nailed it!
[4:32:41] <darkvergillll> blue rose feels so good
[4:32:44] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Why wasn't this game released in May? Think about it tho.
[4:32:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'll get a PS4 or beefy PC someday. FeelsBadMan
[4:32:45] <$SleepyMaribo> whats rawhide do?
[4:32:48] <%px120> @zaworldo Whipchain, I think
[4:32:50] <bazz_tv> so extra damage for your next grab?
[4:32:50] <%ElenaManetta> i'm quitting and going home apatJpeg
[4:32:51] <FirearmsInstructor> Why is he shooting my grandmother's tiffany lamps? ;(
[4:32:57] <hotrax> whats rawhide do?
[4:32:57] <%ThePuddingDead> who's controlling those escalators!
[4:32:59] <NumberTooBig> 3.5 hours left
[4:33:01] <+TheBitingIrish> 'Shit-zillion'
[4:33:04] <waifoong98> Unarmed LUL
[4:33:05] <Nobuwaroo> I like the "head canon" that becasu of Nico's driving shit flies out of the van and thats why some arms are lying around.
[4:33:07] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder how fun this game for folks like me, someone who's never gotten a pure plantinum in his life
[4:33:10] <forgetme000> just realized nero's VA is the same as ichigo from bleach
[4:33:13] <%xsnowfox> devil MAY cry for its delayed release
[4:33:16] <billiyjoe_jimbob> WAIT, YOU RELOAD IN DMC?
[4:33:17] <%Sycada> @ThePuddingDead Nanomachines
[4:33:24] <+harpsichord_uiy> its so gorgeous Kreygasm
[4:33:25] <gigacanuck> PHONE
[4:33:25] <+libra_zero> what happens of you press the arm button when you have no arm?
[4:33:32] <Archmortal> @forgetme000 thankfully way better voice direction though
[4:33:32] <+TomServal> @nobuwaroo That's hilarious and possible.
[4:33:34] <+TheBitingIrish> @billiyjoe_jimbob Nero does
[4:33:39] <KaptainKappathe5th> damn
[4:33:41] <$milhousego> YOU MISSED A PHONE
[4:33:41] <dan_g_v> so, Nico builds a metric ton of arms because she knows she's going to "displace" them at some point?
[4:33:42] <SsHomes> that music FeelsGoodMan
[4:33:43] <sileo_patronus> @billiyjoe_jimbob it's just stored charge shots
[4:33:43] <NumberTooBig> @GarbageNirvana Nero and V styles hard in this
[4:33:45] <+Exyoh> There's an aim assist option and lower difficulties. DMC is built for replays. You'll get good eventually
[4:33:46] <waifoong98> that's weird...
[4:33:46] <+namillus> @billiyjoe_jimbob Nero's Charge Shot was replaced with "Colour Up", which loads three Special Shots into Blue Rose
[4:33:48] <Ner234> Show Rawhide if you can
[4:33:51] <%PlainSimpleTailor> So, you don't actually play as Dante in a DMC game?
[4:33:57] <hotrax> @billiyjoe_jimbob just nero Charge shots
[4:33:57] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat show r a w hide
[4:33:58] <iaracatunda> @libra_zero the wire/snatch still works the rest idk
[4:34:00] <jubejube56> so is Pat just replaying the previous mission or do you need to play the same mission with each char before going to the next?
[4:34:00] <NumberTooBig> they style hard in this*
[4:34:00] <%0dokuro> hes just like "Cool"
[4:34:03] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat probably something about rl that these kind of subways are torture for 1 armed people
[4:34:06] <billiyjoe_jimbob> that is so good
[4:34:07] <h33lbr1ng3r> what does 3/5 mean on overture?
[4:34:10] <bazz_tv> Nero doesn't have wacky animal sidekicks
[4:34:12] <%xsnowfox> pretty sure you play as dante in EVERY DMC game
[4:34:12] <Hammerknife> @PlainSimpleTailor dante's too old at this point in the timeline
[4:34:20] <jubejube56> @H33LBR1NG3R 3 out of 5 devil breakers he can hold
[4:34:23] <Hammerknife> he's like cranky kong
[4:34:25] <+namillus> Dante's napping, don't worry about him
[4:34:26] <Tha_Mik> I mean its not Dante may cry so
[4:34:32] <h33lbr1ng3r> @jubejube56 thanks
[4:34:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "practice in 4"
[4:34:41] <+peri_d0t> @tha_mik exactly
[4:34:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Suuuure, not last week
[4:34:44] <FirearmsInstructor> Exceed is the handle rev thing, right?
[4:34:44] <Fujiwara_92> ELL
[4:34:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> in 5
[4:34:48] <%Nobrev> I heard that dark slayer noise
[4:34:51] <+harpsichord_uiy> some SSX tricky stunting
[4:34:51] <NumberTooBig> ok good, im getting the hang of max act in 4 so i should be fine here
[4:34:59] <HebbieJebbies> @AngriestPat Is getting that exceed rev harder than learning the dodge times in Dark Souls?
[4:35:01] <derovell> not a single max-act so far? no dignity
[4:35:08] <billiyjoe_jimbob> recently beat bloody palace as nero, am I ready ?
[4:35:12] <iaracatunda> @H33LBR1NG3R overture is the type of arm he has equiped 3/5 mean he has 3 arms left out of 5 free slots
[4:35:12] <$ooblagis> He hasn't bought Max-Act
[4:35:13] <InvaderKAZ> Is Exceed easier now?
[4:35:15] <+namillus> @derovell He doesn't have MAX-Act yet
[4:35:17] <redial_nick> all those years WITHOUT DMC games
[4:35:18] <Zombrocom> He doesn't have max act
[4:35:20] <bazz_tv> I guess it "EXCEEDED" your expectations huh?
[4:35:21] <derovell> aw poo
[4:35:24] <Shishi1205> What moves does the ia have @AngriestPat ?
[4:35:25] <%UPTONOGOOD18> how far is pat in the game right now
[4:35:25] <zerogit> BANG BANG BANG
[4:35:26] <Rincewind1998> @HebbieJebbies Base rev, no. Max rev? yes
[4:35:26] <HurtDuck> can i buy this game on steam and play it today? or do i need to wait until tomrrow (3/8)
[4:35:30] <Mechanical_Mayhem> Do you need to play the previous games to understand/enjoy this one? I saw the catchup already but I am curious
[4:35:30] <%0dokuro> It seems Like V's AI is better to have then Nero's.
[4:35:31] <NumberTooBig> @InvaderKAZ same timing so you can practice now in 4
[4:35:32] <zerogit> he pulled his devil trigger
[4:35:38] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Does V use the moveset you bought for him when hes A.I controlled?
[4:35:40] <%0dokuro> Nero was just shooting mostly the entire time with his AI
[4:35:43] <Hyphixsys> Geryon just became a jobber LUL
[4:35:50] <HebbieJebbies> @Rincewind1998 I imagine max act is still frame perfect?
[4:35:50] <%ThePuddingDead> oooohhhh
[4:35:54] <%ThePuddingDead> its the whip!

[4:36:13] <SulfurousAcid> die monster!
[4:36:14] <RiverBirch> fucking course it is
[4:36:15] <+namillus> Rawhide: "What if Nero has more melee combos"
[4:36:16] <danknugglit> Fuuuuck this game is sick
[4:36:18] <%SergeEXE> YEYEYEYE
[4:36:18] <$ooblagis> Too bad it seems to do like no damage
[4:36:19] <+tigerfang86> ANGERY combo

[4:36:19] <waifoong98> Orochi musou LUL
[4:36:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> damn
[4:36:21] <Nugaze> @joltyj how do the other devil breakers break ? Other than tomboy
[4:36:25] <NumberTooBig> @Mechanical_Mayhem maybe just know that in 3, Dante got weapon switching, in 4, style switching, now he's got Weapon-Style switching LUL
[4:36:26] <TyrantBelial> So Rawhide is Nero's Swordmaster?
[4:36:29] <hotrax> @Mechanical_Mayhem the game have all of the story of previous games in the main menu
[4:36:30] <%ThePuddingDead> whats the charge on rawhide?
[4:36:32] <%badmr7> its a freaking judgement cut
[4:36:33] <iaracatunda> whips and timestop, is this bayonetta?
[4:36:33] <Valdorick> Sha! Idina!
[4:36:41] <bazz_tv> Rawhide is Castlevania mode
[4:36:43] <%FoulNightingale> Sup, Pat?
[4:36:46] <%0dokuro> ya, V's AI is much better to have
[4:36:58] <+harpsichord_uiy> sayNom sayNom
[4:36:59] <smward87> they're also flying right now...so yes @iaracatunda
[4:37:00] <+namillus> Devil Breakers break: 1) when getting hit while trying to use them; 2) after a Break Age super move; 3) after using the Break Away "get out of trouble" move, which deliberately blows up the arm.
[4:37:04] <SsHomes> LUL
[4:37:14] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[4:37:17] <Idon__> I can't decide which breaker is my favorite.
[4:37:20] <Idon__> They're all so cool
[4:37:21] <Nugaze> @namillus Nice, ty!
[4:37:21] <mangocoal01> Is he replaying missions?
[4:37:26] <%ThePuddingDead> okie doke :3
[4:37:29] <%Lithdoran> What is Rawhide's Break Age?
[4:37:33] <%QueequegTheater> yes
[4:37:43] <%skizzuto> @Lithdoran he just did it
[4:37:46] <KaptainKappathe5th> whats ragtime break do?
[4:37:46] <zerogit> we just saw it
[4:37:46] <+namillus> @mangocoal01 This mission is playable with both V and Nero, so Pat's showing off both versions.
[4:37:54] <SsHomes> only for missions where you can choose different
[4:37:55] <%Remery_> trapped in the stopped time
[4:37:56] <+namillus> Ragtime's Break Age is AoE Time Slow
[4:37:57] <%Lithdoran> I must have looked away
[4:38:06] <sileo_patronus> LUL
[4:38:06] <+HandPicked> Slowing time is ok, I guess.
[4:38:06] <zerogit> you have dio's stand as an arm
[4:38:09] <Dragon_Batman> Ragtime seems pretty dope
[4:38:09] <mangocoal01> @namillus Ohhhhh. Thanks for the info. I just got here.
[4:38:10] <zerogit> and you say its just ok
[4:38:12] <%ThePuddingDead> it def has uses but yea
[4:38:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It's interesting, just watching your fingers/inputs on the controller is actually very rhythmic and repetitive with only small deviations to the pattern. I see what you mean with the L2 after "X". Reminds me of Diablo III inputs.
[4:38:16] <iaracatunda> i mean its not witch time
[4:38:17] <zerogit> do you even know what jojo'
[4:38:17] <Sajallday> Best way to time exceed?
[4:38:32] <+fakelines96> @AngriestPat Is ragtime applicable to long taunt chains?
[4:38:34] <etalmeta> @Lithdoran nero grabs an enemy on the end of the whip then does alot of strikes around him, with a aoe slam at the end
[4:38:34] <$ooblagis> It seems like the problem with it is that you're using it on enemeis who stun locked anyway, so it doesn't do much
[4:38:37] <Hammerknife> so can you play through the nero chapters without any arms at all
[4:38:38] <%MagickBurritoh> AIR HIKE TIME
[4:38:38] <+BrightOctarine> So people that bought this from key shops like gmg can't play as capcom forgot to put the exe file in. We have to wait for a new patch :/
[4:38:51] <NumberTooBig> @Sajallday it based on the sword's impact
[4:38:53] <h33lbr1ng3r> glad to see red orbs being always useful now
[4:38:59] <%xsnowfox> all about that timing
[4:38:59] <bazz_tv> have anyone heard the other announcers available in the deluxe edition?
[4:38:59] <derovell> ragtime is a good opportunity to use red queen combo A
[4:39:01] <Fujiwara_92> BUY AIR HIKE

[4:43:45] <gigacanuck> SICK
[4:43:45] <%xsnowfox> hot
[4:43:45] <billiyjoe_jimbob> cant have devil may cry game without timestop move
[4:43:45] <jubejube56> ragtime seems like it needs another ability and for time orb to be on a cooldown
[4:43:46] <%px120> You don't like the bubble?
[4:43:48] <Idon__> Link dash attack
[4:43:52] <%ThePuddingDead> yooo
[4:43:52] <Rincewind1998> Nero has drive now!
[4:43:52] <derovell> fucking otg, what is this marvel?
[4:43:53] <bazz_tv> what you don't like having greyron's bubbles pat?
[4:43:53] <King___Crimson> BACKSLASH
[4:43:56] <TurtleButter> It's kinda awesome that 'time stop' is one of the more generic abilities in DMCV.
[4:43:57] <NumberTooBig> thats the stuff
[4:43:57] <blackdragonz> yeah those are new
[4:43:57] <hotrax> Generic What?
[4:44:00] <%ThePuddingDead> but y tho
[4:44:05] <%0dokuro> Punished Nero
[4:44:05] <+namillus> I think, when you look at Nero's Devil Breakers, and you go "the one that slows down time is Okay I Guess", that, uh, SETS THE STANDARD for the Devil Breakers
[4:44:06] <JJMR322> just got here. how far ahead is Pat in the game?
[4:44:09] <Mockisho> You could say that Nero is disarmed.
[4:44:11] <dekkitout> Armless run, GO!
[4:44:12] <%ThePuddingDead> mission fuckin 8
[4:44:14] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @JJMR322 almost half way
[4:44:16] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat So will DMC 5 produce the most insane combo mad videos in the history of Character Action?
[4:44:19] <$nademonkey1100> how does he reload
[4:44:21] <+Mrkel90> @AngriestPat Max has just started playing this btw
[4:44:22] <%MagickBurritoh> Arms are just temporary buffs
[4:44:22] <Archmortal> Max said something last night that was pretty on-point. Nero spent A LOT of time fighting with one arm outside DMC4
[4:44:23] <billiyjoe_jimbob> @Mockisho LUL
[4:44:24] <%JoltyJ> 99 elixirs at the end boss
[4:44:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I might be oblivious, but are your characters automatically switching dependent on stage? When I first joined 45 mins ago you were using a guy with a cane and a panther. Now you're Nero? Did you chose that or is it auto?
[4:44:25] <Hammerknife> this might be a guess, but it looks like his movement animations are actually different when armless. like his swings and stuff are weight shifted
[4:44:26] <+namillus> Bonus: If Nero doesn't have any Devil Breakers equipped, his Air Guitar taunt produces no sound
[4:44:26] <Valdorick> He got 50% off at the plot sale - it only cost him an arm Kappa
[4:44:29] <Ner234> Armless% lets go
[4:44:31] <%vincerocmm> let me use my strong hand
[4:44:32] <SomeAsianDood> @nademonkey1100 sticks it in his armpit
[4:44:35] <Idon__> @nademonkey1100 He tucks the revolver underneath his right armpit and reloads with his left hand.
[4:44:35] <derovell> do you keep the arms if you finish a mission with them?
[4:44:37] <NumberTooBig> @drfaustisdead VoltaBass is halfway there
[4:44:39] <%SergeEXE> Is that a Royal Guard arm??
[4:44:40] <shevan123> @AngriestPat do you think nero's ambidextrous
[4:44:41] <%Mr_Strut> But what if you need the,
[4:44:43] <%flagi64> @angriestpat are you beating the game tonight or nahhhhh?
[4:44:44] <rufus2k2> @nademonkey1100 tucks it in his armpit and reloads it left handed
[4:44:45] <%trnzero> lava apparently defies gravity
[4:44:47] <waifoong98> He got Gilgamesh landing basically
[4:44:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[4:44:51] <Idon__> @AngriestPat You think V has potential for some stylish shit?
[4:44:51] <James_Quivers> Big dumb lava elevator lmao
[4:44:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 44m.
[4:44:52] <%hntronium> BUT PAT. What if. YOU NEED THOSE ARMS LATER.
[4:44:54] <%Lithdoran> Gerbera is Trickster arm, iirc
[4:44:58] <+namillus> That's not lava.

[4:48:18] <Hammerknife> @AngriestPat when was the last time you had PFK
[4:48:18] <+namillus> The Pasta Breaker is a weaker Punch Line with a weaker Overture as its Break Age
[4:48:19] <%taco_choppa> how far in is Pat?
[4:48:19] <Vohs_Bru> ELMO can beat DMC5 still today
[4:48:23] <Dingo_Eejit> "oH HAI, IT'S YOUR PIZZA BOY. Got yer fresh tasty pizza right here, with a nice side of GOBLINS!"

[4:48:33] <%Nobrev> why didnt you ride punchline over there
[4:48:36] <+namillus> Its advantage is... you can have it at the start of the game
[4:48:40] <%ThePuddingDead> god it even SOUNDS like leviathan
[4:48:44] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> What does that do?
[4:48:46] <Idon__> Gerbera, the COOLER gerbera
[4:48:52] <graemecrackers1> pull the devil trigger
[4:48:55] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> A reskin gerbera?
[4:48:56] <FirearmsInstructor> @ThatGuyfromMars yea he has a magazine of arms on his leg... WTF?
[4:49:00] <+namillus> Isn't that the Air Trick Gerbera?
[4:49:03] <derovell> it aint nero if there's no buster
[4:49:03] <+TheBitingIrish> Can you not switch arms before they break?
[4:49:05] <+EtheralFlameX> is the GP01 just a skin?
[4:49:08] <Idon__> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck Nah, it's got a slightly different moveset
[4:49:14] <+Exyoh> Deluxe edition gerbera goes up & down
[4:49:19] <sileo_patronus> @EtheralFlameX it has up and down trick
[4:49:22] <+Exyoh> It's also a Gundam reference
[4:49:25] <TurtleButter> GOD that move is cool
[4:49:25] <Idon__> Instead of the reflect, you can launch yourself up off the ground or while airborne down to the floor.
[4:49:31] <+peri_d0t> I just realized nero doesnt have a devil trigger anymore. I'm guessing hell get it later
[4:49:33] <rufus2k2> buuuug

[4:49:46] <NumberTooBig> that giant demon mantis gave you smooches
[4:49:47] <rufus2k2> does buster arm have a grab for him?
[4:49:49] <etalmeta> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck the neutral use pushes nero straight up if he's on the floor, straight down if he's in the air
[4:49:51] <Dingo_Eejit> HE'LL yeah!
[4:49:51] <+namillus> Yeah, no Devil Trigger in this level, spooky huh?
[4:49:52] <gigacanuck> do sick buster move on this mofo
[4:49:53] <%0dokuro> He lost his Devil trigger when his arm was cut off
[4:49:53] <dan_g_v> bye bye No Hit Bonus. Again

[4:51:00] <%px120> That's really cool
[4:51:06] <Idon__> Pat, is there any frustrating platforming in 5?

[4:52:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't be mean to Plague's son like that. Goatman isn't bad, just misunderstood.
[4:52:43] <+namillus> @AngriestPat Are the basic grabs for the Buster Arm all one-hit kills? If so, what's the advantage of Break Age, same as Tomboy where it's a guarantee the arm won't break until it's done?

[4:54:20] <+Dr_Butthurt_PhD> AngelThump
[4:54:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Man the interface fadeout after a brief second to give you a zero-hud, full cinematic screen in this game and RE2Re is a FANTASTIC and probably underapprecaited / unnoticed feature. I love it.
[4:54:28] <+libra_zero> something something Goddess of Time something
[4:54:28] <fmc009> what mission is this?
[4:54:28] <dekkitout> What? Can Nico not bring the van to you? LUL
[4:54:30] <turf_wind_and_fire> Pat you sneaky bitch.
[4:54:31] <KaptainKappathe5th> i refuse to believe theres no payphones in hell
[4:54:35] <+zaworldo> WHY CAN'T nico DRIVE IN HERE
[4:54:36] <NivekMD> wow this area reminds me of the inferno area in Bayo 2
[4:54:36] <%King_JaXon> They're statues of the Goddess of time.
[4:54:43] <$ooblagis> Bye Borb
[4:54:47] <+namillus> The Goddess of Time Hates Demons. That's all you need to know.
[4:54:47] <%ThePuddingDead> punchline and buster for me most likely
[4:54:50] <bazz_tv> you don't question our time godess boy
[4:54:50] <Jack_Nightshadow> Divinty Statues cuz it would be too ridiculous for a Van to come crashing throught this Demon tree.
[4:54:55] <%ScreamingMeat> Oh, now the Goddess of Time is a woman wearing a Lion Head hood instead of a weird lady with a lion head for a head
[4:54:59] <iaracatunda> @NivekMD i was just thinking that
[4:55:05] <+TheBrazilianHope> Actually playing the game instead of just talking PogChamp
[4:55:05] <Brutal_Defeat> How far is pat?
[4:55:10] <bazz_tv> yes she is wearing a furry costume but we don't question her
[4:55:11] <%px120> @AngriestPat What do you think of the enemy design in this game? Better than 3 and 4's?
[4:55:25] <+DeRedBaron> something along the lines of it takes sacrifices of demon blood to power you up
[4:55:26] <bestwaifuritsu> called it
[4:55:30] <%lloyddboy> RESTART
[4:55:30] <Dragon_Batman> fall to the groouon
[4:55:34] <%ScreamingMeat> !Blorb Lost!
[4:55:35] <bazz_tv> is she was good enough for bug jesus Sparda then she is good enough for you
[4:55:35] <jubejube56> seems like you need gerbera for that
[4:55:37] <HebbieJebbies> Have you just tried doing better?
[4:55:41] <iaracatunda> the godess of time has become a furry
[4:55:41] <Fujiwara_92> RESET
[4:55:42] <+RadiantBurrito> soiled ot
[4:55:51] <+aspirationdeath> Does time stop help there?
[4:55:51] <%Mr_Strut> DMC 5 is ruined now
[4:55:52] <dan_g_v> you could follow Hornet's advice and gigut
[4:55:56] <gigacanuck> he'll go back and get that offscreen, don't worry
[4:55:58] <vVAstrAVv> thats why you come back for it on easy mode lol
[4:56:01] <dan_g_v> gitgud even
[4:56:08] <%ThePuddingDead> time for death?
[4:56:09] <tri3dgE027> Mmmmm, look at this big-boy with big HP bar
[4:56:15] <%sirmackslot> can you break the shield?
[4:56:20] <Dingo_Eejit> "Daww!"
[4:56:21] <etalmeta> yes
[4:56:26] <+namillus> "what's the enemy design like in this game" There are lots of different Angelos and they all talk, what more do you want
[4:56:37] <h33lbr1ng3r> has Pat tried DMD?
[4:56:49] <%Lithdoran> I wonder if you ever fight multiple Proto Angelo
[4:56:52] <dan_g_v> Devil May Dine? He hates the Pasta Breaker
[4:57:01] <Rincewind1998> So uhh, why no music?
[4:57:05] <bazz_tv> I wonder if they are going to add turbo mode to this
[4:57:09] <+namillus> Dante Must Die, the difficulty level above Son of Sparda
[4:57:10] <waifoong98> @Lithdoran prob bloody palace shenanigans
[4:57:13] <Idon__> WACK WACK WACK WACK
[4:57:16] <Saltmeisterr> @AngriestPat what is rawhide's deal?
[4:57:17] <dan_g_v> no music because we in serious mode
[4:57:18] <Desmondcsz> @Lithdoran probably in higher difficulties
[4:57:21] <%Jigokuro> t101Big apatBig t101Oof
[4:57:21] <+SkaNinja> kill that Proto Man with your Mega Buster
[4:57:24] <Idon__> Best combo in the entire game
[4:57:31] <etalmeta> the demon tree has a more ominous tone so they cut the rock
[4:57:31] <%ThePuddingDead> woah
[4:57:31] <billiyjoe_jimbob> is there turbo mod?
[4:57:33] <%SergeEXE> oh Pat
[4:57:36] <waifoong98> inb4 2 Artemis in BP LUL
[4:57:38] <+Exyoh> Fight music varies from the main themes to remixes and ambient stuff
[4:57:40] <%foreverN2dust> where is the music?
[4:57:50] <tri3dgE027> Is the Diving Slash an upgrade to Nero's Helmbreaker?
[4:57:53] <WeebFever> Rawhide is Darkest Lariat
[4:57:56] <%Guardiansaiyan> Woah
[4:58:01] <bazz_tv> @Rincewind1998 you need at least rank S to get the theme really going
[4:58:03] <%Lithdoran> Pat is too 44 HOURS to get the musi
[4:58:05] <%Lithdoran> music*
[4:58:07] <etalmeta> @tri3dgE027 he has both
[4:58:08] <NumberTooBig> @foreverN2dust in S rank
[4:58:12] <Idon__> Ever wanted to use that whip move that the lingering will had in KH2? Well here you go.
[4:58:14] <dan_g_v> use Sweet Surrender then for your Health
[4:58:19] <%ThePuddingDead> reverrrrse biiiiiirth
[4:58:22] <+namillus> @tri3dgE027 Nero's Split got moved to Lockon+Back+Sword in the air, this new move is Lockon+Forward+Sword
[4:58:26] <SomeAsianDood> Not this again DansGame
[4:58:28] <Rincewind1998> @bazz_tv I know, but I didn't hear ANY music
[4:58:32] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How awesome is the HUD / overlay fadeout in non-combat after a brief second? I think the zero-hud, full cinematic screen in this game and RE2Re is implemented FANTASTICLY and probably one of the most underappreciated / unnoticed features.
[4:58:38] <+Exyoh> This part is just spooky ambience. Devil Trigger doesn't play all the time
[4:58:38] <derovell> go into the period blood
[4:58:39] <tri3dgE027> Sweet, can't wait to try out the game after work

[4:59:40] <+HotBloodedHero> BULLY the demons
[4:59:41] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat Aside from the EX color, any DmC references?
[4:59:44] <%Lithdoran> Nero is more "S-SISTER"
[4:59:45] <bazz_tv> oh hey you got Kyrie's vibrator
[4:59:48] <FirearmsInstructor> @Exyoh How often does DT play? Have you noticed? Seems infrequent or subtle. I haven't noticed it.
[4:59:49] <kingdomkey92> You know what Nero's Dive attack looks oftely familiar to Squall's Rough Divide in the Dissidia games
[4:59:51] <alcors_wisdom> @waifoong98 sweet fate reference you fokcing weeb
[4:59:53] <+TheBrazilianHope> SAVAGE
[4:59:54] <iaracatunda> Pat does the controller vibrate while using that???

[5:00:26] <Idon__> Not "You're going down" smh
[5:00:30] <NumberTooBig> shouldve used shuffle
[5:00:31] <$HeroToxiko> @vergil_angelo and v is an emo
[5:00:31] <+Exyoh> @FirearmsInstructor Usually when Nero's doing big fights or stuff away from spooky demon caves
[5:00:32] <Artista_AF> @Lithdoran *Girlfriend more like :B
[5:00:33] <gigacanuck> @Lithdoran it's okay, they're blood siblings
[5:00:36] <+Marktherussian1> I came here for pro plays, and the first thing i see is Pat get frozen. hahaha
[5:00:45] <gigacanuck> *they're not blodd siblings god damn
[5:00:46] <+namillus> @Rincewind1998 "Scum" is an alternate for that taunt
[5:00:46] <Idon__> well that's underwhelming.
[5:00:48] <%ScreamingMeat> Boring
[5:00:54] <ibringhate> You trash
[5:00:55] <%ThePuddingDead> i kinda miss the circular guage for revving red queen
[5:00:56] <Rincewind1998> @namillus whew
[5:00:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Capcom got tired of you assholes and ya bullshit, We taking it back to 1992 on ya bitch asses
[5:00:59] <bazz_tv> is probably cool with tomboy though
[5:01:00] <Deagle117> the height of platforming
[5:01:03] <ibringhate> Sucker
[5:01:05] <+namillus> That was Hard Way, Payline is the aerial dive
[5:01:08] <waifoong98> look at these $$$$$$
[5:01:13] <iaracatunda> i wish there was a unbirth elevator here
[5:01:13] <deathsmions1> wow what a fucking video game
[5:01:13] <derovell> does tomboy change all your moves?
[5:01:16] <Vohs_Bru> ok its early bedtime for me
[5:01:16] <dan_g_v> this is the best platforming on any DMC game, ever
[5:01:21] <%Lithdoran> @Artista_AF Kyrie and Credo's family also more-or-less adopted Nero
[5:01:22] <FirearmsInstructor> How long is an average / typical play though of this game? 40 hours?
[5:01:24] <ibringhate> Hahahahaha
[5:01:26] <+zaworldo> pAYLINE is airborne @AngriestPat

[5:01:34] <deathsmions1> tomatoCrust bang my devil bring patrice
[5:01:37] <gigacanuck> Nero is definitely a NEE-CHAN kind of guy, and Kyrie is definitely an ONII-CHAN kind of girl, so it's a match made in heaven

[5:10:35] <nzrai> this is just xemnas from kh 2 Kappa
[5:10:41] <+Lutre> monkaS the bar's not moving
[5:10:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @namillus damn thanks. Are they selling them separately if you don't get deluxe? Or is that the only way to acquire them?
[5:10:44] <%shockzndrawe> It's Cliffy B
[5:10:46] <Idon__> Fleshy Xemnas
[5:10:47] <devanmuse> this one (borderline) unwinnable, too?

[5:10:51] <emillionghost> !uptime
[5:10:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 10m.
[5:10:56] <dukenux> Thats a big life bar
[5:10:59] <tri3dgE027> Is Nero basically doing a "No Johns"
[5:10:59] <+Lutre> he's just sitting there... menacingly
[5:11:01] <%H0rnedG0d> This aint it
[5:11:01] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Yeah literally Xemnas LUL
[5:11:05] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Now I see the Xemnas vibes
[5:11:06] <sosuke5> this is just ifrit from ff 15 Kappa
[5:11:10] <bazz_tv> man gebera is really useful here
[5:11:10] <billiyjoe_jimbob> man, this game is a breath of fresh air after DmC
[5:11:13] <+namillus> The four extra Devil Breakers (Gerbera GP-01, Pasta Breaker, Sweet Surrender and Mega Buster) are purchasable separately.
[5:11:13] <%claudesavegely> I love how chill this guy is
[5:11:14] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL there is no damage happening to that bar
[5:11:17] <fmc009> man that life bar is oof
[5:11:17] <+MageShady> SO is that like, summon shields?
[5:11:18] <Valdorick> Urizan vs phase 1 Xenhort vs Aizen vs the Emperor of Mankind - BATTLE OF THE SLOUCH!
[5:11:21] <+libra_zero> are these fights timed, or do you actually have to die?
[5:11:30] <Fujiwara_92> The barrier has a hp bar look
[5:11:32] <dukenux> oh wait, hes just not doing any harm LUL
[5:11:35] <+Zeromaru2> So that's 2 hopeless boss fight
[5:11:36] <+tigerfang86> sounds like Urizen needs to get MOTIVATED...
[5:11:38] <%AncelDeLambert> guys I don't think Nero wins this one
[5:11:38] <dead_harmony13> Yeah this is a xemnas fight

[5:27:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Just make the fucking hands bigger
[5:27:14] <realm_forge> Dollar store cereal mascot
[5:27:14] <%AncelDeLambert> it was such a dumb idea to even TRY
[5:27:14] <TyroneRugen> Oh, I'm here in time for Sonic hate!
[5:27:18] <Dragon_Batman> It does just looks off
[5:27:26] <%jiin6> They did not give a Fuck
[5:27:27] <$nademonkey1100> LUL
[5:27:30] <%Ion_Laser> "artists"
[5:27:30] <%vectorcannonready> Gotta go fast...in the opposite direction
[5:27:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Or we coulda just had a animated Movie?
[5:27:34] <desktopduck3000> I am so HYPE.
[5:27:35] <%SaltyDongs> Hedgie
[5:27:35] <FirearmsInstructor> If a *SINGLE* fuck was given... it may be "OK" lol
[5:27:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Huh
[5:27:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Eh
[5:27:38] <%AncelDeLambert> it looks like a guy in a horrific furry suit
[5:27:39] <$nademonkey1100> just gave a single fuck
[5:27:49] <%ElenaManetta> But also, 2D painted concept art is a lot different than in-motion CG animation on live action footage. People can photoshop all day, it MIGHT not have looked good in a final product.
[5:27:54] <desktopduck3000> I’m currently sitting in my room room waiting for the game to go live XD
[5:27:55] <%JJCheeker> They Should not have made that live action
[5:28:01] <%jiin6> detect pickachu's trailer makes it loot interesting
[5:28:02] <Tracazoid> Mr. Mime is as horrific as I would hope.
[5:28:02] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I absolutely love that every single fiefdom of the fandom was united in hatred of that fresh hellish garbage
[5:28:09] <+ArcLifth> I want to see a bad trailer
[5:28:13] <agadejobi> I expect that movie to be fucking trash
[5:28:14] <+JackMillerTime> it looksw like a blue ugandan knuckles
[5:28:14] <%Ion_Laser> @JJCheeker should have been completely CGI
[5:28:15] <PhantomMaskJr> He just looks like a blue hairy human boy asiEW
[5:28:19] <+mugwugsampoo> 35 minutes gym 4:37
[5:28:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats the thing tho, Photoshop is literally what they do in CGI movies. They punch up everything with frame painting
[5:28:28] <Pookiedaexzile> and yes they pay for frame painting
[5:28:28] <%jiin6> Paige is sleepy on the drugs
[5:28:33] <$nademonkey1100> LUL popping them xans
[5:28:34] <SomersaultJustice> the sonic could have been worse
[5:28:35] <agadejobi> They should have had the guys who made the Sonic Boom cartoon make a movie
[5:28:35] <%Mr_Strut> Xanax stream!
[5:28:44] <realm_forge> Druggy Paige is funny Paige
[5:28:49] <emillionghost> will you watch it?

[5:28:56] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@london_flexing) (warning)
[5:28:56] <%JJCheeker> I hope it's hilariously bad
[5:29:08] <NumberTooBig> it can't be bad enough to justify it's existance
[5:29:10] <%ElenaManetta> Why is Paige's audio always more crystal clear than Pat's
[5:29:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat IT'S NO USE! D:<
