[0:13:56] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt how much did HotS rolls cost?
[0:13:58] <DKDiamantes> They really are, the double first purcase are okay but past that its fucking insane what they charge

[0:14:08] <thisisacoolguy> You will never beat Mario Kart Tours whale hunting
[0:14:10] <%JohnAtDawn> F/GO has the same price
[0:14:12] <scrumbotime> Yeah, that's..... that's pretty normal for gatcha, 30 bucks for a ten roll
[0:14:13] <%AmericanaRed> I got all the WAIFUS for free shibuy4Popuko shibuy4Pipimi

[0:15:02] <DKDiamantes> I find it awkward when Pat is nice to me
[0:15:02] <%king_wragles> What if it's Crash?
[0:15:04] <%Dementedpenguin> Can't wait for the 400th Fire Emblem character Kappa
[0:15:04] <%ssjklyco> Doom Guy is a mii costume, so nope
[0:15:05] <revoltingimp> NotLikeThis
[0:15:06] <Oxybe> C'mon Shao Kahn!
[0:15:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's gonna be Sans from Undertale
[0:15:10] <%Broand> It's 10/1 tomorrow, 101, WONDER RED
[0:15:11] <thatsocrunchy> Can someone explain what gatcha is exactly??? Is it just spending money to aquire weapons and characters?
[0:15:13] <ShichiNoBushi> Actual Doom Guy and not a costume so you officially win the bet.
[0:15:15] <pixelandarilho> please be dante
[0:15:15] <%crimsonharvest> I hope it's Tommy from GTA3
[0:15:15] <%AmericanaRed> FORTNITE GUY NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:15:18] <%Profmcstevie> Hearing people talk about gacha game design mechanics is like addicts trying to argue their poison is "less than that other one"
[0:15:19] <%ssjklyco> It's free money
[0:15:19] <marvel877> Popular in the west? Who said that? That the rumor mill again?
[0:15:20] <joyeuseone> Definitely Nero from the hit series devil may cry
[0:15:20] <@SSaryn> It's got its' own Marketplace for fucks sake.
[0:15:22] <%PanicSwytch> ITS BASICALLY FREE
[0:15:23] <Mr_Strut> "It's basically free."
[0:15:23] <DKDiamantes> Oh god yeah
[0:15:24] <%ChestMimik> Ridley made it guys!
[0:15:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have avoided almost all discussion, so I saw nothing about the popular in the west comments
[0:15:29] <%cvp5127> fate PogChamp
[0:15:30] <penitentpentwitch> You can trade Warframe currency at least?
[0:15:31] <Mrrccava> BUT ITS LIKE FREE MONEY THO. LIKE THRIFT STORES!
[0:15:32] <1matheuw> i mean doesnt microsoft have their own smash clone in dev? aand microsoft owns id now i think
[0:15:33] <%maenos2> @thatsocrunchy you spend money for currency, roll for random pack.
[0:15:33] <%Regigangster> LUL Warframe plat is dirt cheap comparatively
[0:15:37] <%PanicSwytch> FREE MONEY
[0:15:38] <%aogman> pat they are fucking learning to make fun gacha games
[0:15:40] <%ThirdWelles> Yeah the Japanese shit is WAY more predatory
[0:15:42] <%AncelDeLambert> pretty consistent coupons for that game
[0:15:43] <%Mendin> You can actively trade in-game-farmable items to other people to make Platinum it is beautiful
[0:15:44] <%aogman> I'm scared and doomed
[0:15:45] <DKDiamantes> Warframe tells you upfront what you get, no RNG, heres the thing you want and heres how much it costs
[0:15:46] <lovebass4stuff> Heavy from tf2 for smash
[0:15:49] <%OperatorJo_> oh yeah, try a GUMI gacha. THAT is expensive
[0:15:50] <exack> The terrible thing is that Genshin isn't even the worst of the gachas. At least it has a pity system, and it's half the cost of GBF LUL
[0:15:53] <%Regigangster> Oopsy :)
[0:15:53] <@SSaryn> Sure does
[0:15:54] <pixelkenj> mistakes, or whoopsie poopsies

[0:16:15] <@SSaryn> Well, that and the Warframes themselves.
[0:16:17] <DKDiamantes> I can't handle talking about Rivens anymore man
[0:16:18] <%umbranviking> GBF is like 60 bucks for ten rolls
[0:16:23] <%ThirdWelles> @SaltkeyAndAckfish Already happened
[0:16:26] <Aydarkzero> every time i hear about Warframe everyone seems to dislike it more
[0:16:29] <%Bluwizard21> @Dementedpenguin sweet thank you

[0:16:50] <%ChestMimik> Pat stares at the wiki he JUST read

[0:16:54] <%cvp5127> ea wet dream
[0:16:54] <%Regigangster> LUL
[0:16:57] <%Regigangster> True
[0:16:59] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @ThirdWelles i know, but will there be more streams?
[0:17:02] <pixelkenj> pachislot***
[0:17:03] <%Dementedpenguin> I played a game once not knowing it was a gachan type..... lord that was a horrible experience.
[0:17:04] <Huntercd> I want to gamble for real money
[0:17:06] <%Profmcstevie> And you'll all fucking play Genshin cos it's free, ignoring all the people it's designed to abuse
[0:17:06] <Zebroneath> Gotta reel in them whales!
[0:17:12] <Aydarkzero> it's for that reason that i will never give those games the time of day
[0:17:15] <assfordayz> so MGS3?
[0:17:16] <%crimsonharvest> its like when you outlaw weed now we have super weed
[0:17:17] <%Nordguy> and people pay hundred thousands of dollars on it
[0:17:18] <+warlockwithapixie> Oh, I just got an add, that's never happened before.
[0:17:20] <thatsocrunchy> Oh okay, and packs are all randomized? @maenos2
[0:17:21] <revoltingimp> Surprise presents you buy for yourself! :D
[0:17:21] <1matheuw> techinically not gambling, the SAFEST kind of gambling
[0:17:21] <%Valdorick> "No Gambling!" "Time to make super Gambling!" "No porn!" "TIME TO MAKE SUPER PORN!"
[0:17:23] <+wydamn> it's not gambling, it's gombling
[0:17:24] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt When you hit credits on Hades, there's still 10-30% of the game left just off the interactions, depending on how quickly you can reach credits
[0:17:24] <+EySoyCoco> no genshin today? aww
[0:17:27] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Best thing is when they take something that used to be rare and had a stable market price, and be like "OOOPS! We made it a common drop in this new area! It's worthless now!" That makes the people running the markets a bit salty
[0:17:28] <butthurtdave> Wait what do you even gacha for in Genshin?
[0:17:32] <LoneFonte> LUL
[0:17:34] <%OperatorJo_> yeh

[0:18:27] <%crimsonharvest> My aunt runs a doll food studio (making it from clay) and even in that there are whales that will come and buy 4 of everything new no matter what it is
[0:18:28] <%sleepers1mulant> Is arknights good gacha?
[0:18:28] <%Roundelay11> explain how bad it is by covering yourself in it's filth
[0:18:31] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Pat, just do gambling for realsies. Poker streams are a fun time, especially with someone who's bad at poker
[0:18:32] <%CalderGaming> CalderGaming subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Hello beloved fuzzy animal, and also Elmo and Zangief! Quite deep in the 3.x content for FFXIV now and enjoying it a ton. The Vath are very good bugs who try their best. Which beast tribe is your favorite?
[0:18:32] <%blastazoid26> It's free-ish
[0:18:33] <prime_name> Wait, 3 bucks per roll?
[0:18:37] <%DappercatEsquire> as free as your impulses let it be i guess
[0:18:37] <+D00msDayDan> buy genesis crystals, convert them into primogems, then convert them into your fates to roll the gacha
[0:18:38] <+CookieCutter007> it's basically free
[0:18:38] <%MaddyCaddy> What do you think of the battle pass in it though?
[0:18:41] <Zebroneath> The actual game is fun
[0:18:43] <+RenoDeGeneric> It's way too damn expensive, but the game was clearly expensive to make lol
[0:18:45] <@SSaryn> That 5 dollars a month deal is pretty rad tho
[0:18:46] <Aydarkzero> looks like Fatalis is out on MH PogChamp
[0:18:51] <%aogman> it's free and super fucking fun, but I can't even recommend it to my friends
[0:18:52] <dots4eyes> Free is a convulated word in gatcha
[0:18:54] <huskarl_zap> no such thing as good gacha
[0:18:57] <1matheuw> god bless whales
[0:19:01] <+gumballwizard> @D00msDayDan yup

[0:45:41] <%AmericanaRed> don't we all
[0:45:44] <Mr_Strut> Beat the shit out of your teachers, they deserve it
[0:45:46] <EuropanLamprey> People like that don't care about how people think about them so long as they have power of people
[0:45:46] <$RealThiele> she could use mold to takeover
[0:45:47] <jware97> God I never want to go back
[0:45:47] <butthurtdave> Reminds me of the time my brother took me to the hospital to get a cancer screening done and his job was like "where the fuck are you?" and he was like "At the hospital." and his boss was like "Bullshit, let me talk to a doctor"
[0:45:50] <jware97> fuck past me
[0:45:52] <StaticSunrise> the me of now would have actually stabbed two of my teachers
[0:45:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> I had a coach do that when my grandma died. Also a bully was like "WTF DOC you get out of class early!" and I said "my grandma died"
[0:46:04] <%Littlecjmajor> work knew i was on grievance leave and wrote me up for not attending trainings and i didn't even get an apology when i was called into a meeting to "explain myself"

[0:47:10] <penitentpentwitch> Not all of us can get by with a high CHA score, Paige
[0:47:13] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Model students turn to shit afterwards cause you just get jaded off getting no rewards
[0:47:14] <%ssjklyco> The trick to being a model student/kid: Don't get caught.

[0:47:18] <%depressed_skeleton> "What are you going to do, Old man?"
[0:47:20] <%ThirdWelles> We could have gotten away with so much shit ALL THE TIME and now I can never experience that
[0:47:21] <+b_aleph> So that's where the expression "Teacher's Pat" came from
[0:47:24] <sakeydo> kinda easy considering his brothers reputation. Lol

[0:48:20] <+RenoDeGeneric> Model students get fucked up cuz of public school squishing your potential back to average

I felt bad because I convinced like 3 friends to also pre-order it.

[0:59:45] <Vortigon> You look at the You look at the Speclunky and think about how delicious it would be. You think about how delicious it would be if you ate it raw. You think about how delicious it would be if you ate it cooked. You think about how delicious it would be if you ate it boiled.

[0:59:59] <Aydarkzero> was that a Cthulhu?
[1:00:00] <%heartlesshealer> so this game can be reeeally fun and also really frustrating
[1:00:01] <%realm_forge> I’m order to squeeze the orb properly, pat must avail himself of several industrial tarps and a pressure washer

[1:00:09] <munitalprats> GUY GOES INTO AZTEC TOMB
[1:00:11] <%bassoontyphoon> WE CARRY OUR HARPOONS
[1:00:11] <pixelkenj> or did the moon come to the aztecs
[1:00:13] <%Puhff> spebunky
[1:00:13] <+maybefalco> i unironically liked brink
[1:00:14] <ShichiNoBushi> "Maclunky"?
[1:00:16] <+Sargon1stClass> oh shit, a winged bull
[1:00:16] <munitalprats> its movement efault
[1:00:17] <+Ches_Neckbeard> fuck yeah aztecs made it to the moon and they took the spiderwomen with them
[1:00:18] <%Fooguwu> it was right there
[1:00:18] <pixelkenj> Also turn in instant restart
[1:00:18] <+tigerfang86> movement default
[1:00:20] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt movement default

[1:00:23] <0rond> movement default
[1:00:23] <DSD24> You passed by it
[1:00:24] <+tigerfang86> Movement Default in controles
[1:00:26] <AlmondRoll> you just passed it LUL
[1:00:26] <jware97> under movement default pat
[1:00:26] <@SSaryn> I'd beg to differ, auto run feels a lot better also its' in Gameplay.
[1:00:26] <digaogrunge> on gameplay
[1:00:28] <jware97> in controls
[1:00:30] <%heartlesshealer> what
[1:00:33] <@SSaryn> Oh
[1:00:36] <@SSaryn> Nvm
[1:00:36] <@SSaryn> Dumb
[1:00:38] <Vortigon> Vibration (low)
[1:00:43] <dots4eyes> Pet style meter
[1:00:44] <+skm742> Yay, good.
[1:00:46] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Gameplay probably?
[1:00:48] <%dj_xo98> but what if aztecs came from the moon?
[1:00:51] <+Zpaztic> Zpaztic subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:00:52] <+skm742> nope
[1:00:53] <%heartlesshealer> it might distract you
[1:00:55] <munitalprats> uhh
[1:00:55] <AlmondRoll> no
[1:00:55] <aeonicvector> not that ive seen yet
[1:00:57] <%realm_forge> Loving the pillar men music
[1:00:58] <pixelkenj> nope
[1:00:59] <TOONFOOD> Nah
[1:00:59] <munitalprats> i dont believe so
[1:01:00] <dukeoftime> nah
[1:01:00] <0rond> it's not used for anything afaik
[1:01:02] <%shurtal> straight vibin'
[1:01:04] <Grandma_Amari> I tend to turn it off to save battery.
[1:01:04] <segychan> is this la mulana
[1:01:07] <jware97> Assyrians on the MOOON
[1:01:08] <D3rrtyD4n> im kinda with you
[1:01:09] <pixelkenj> pat has sensitive hands
[1:01:10] <0rond> doesn't the eye blinking cause vibration?
[1:01:10] <thatperson462> are we spunky yet
[1:01:10] <%SirKeigan> maybe
[1:01:10] <+wydamn> What if the moon came from the aztecs?
[1:01:11] <%AncelDeLambert> vibration a: sucks, and b: has a nasty habit of glitching out my Xbox controller and never turning off
[1:01:13] <%DappercatEsquire> PS3 was the gen for you
[1:01:13] <+skm742> at least probably not
[1:01:14] <%TheActuallyGuy> vibration is doodoo
[1:01:14] <HitoBeat> Pat loved the Sixaxis
[1:01:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Pat hates HD Rumble
[1:01:19] <Vortigon> vibration gamers
[1:01:19] <dapperskeleton69> i stopped noticing
[1:01:20] <%Fooguwu> what about HD rumble
[1:01:20] <s1rcuit> it hurts my hands after a while
[1:01:21] <%AzureGale> Nothing worse than a game without a vibration option
[1:01:23] <+dmtjinni> why
[1:01:26] <+skm742> eye blink both has visual and audio cue
[1:01:27] <butthurtdave> And that one gun in Borderlands
[1:01:27] <wibbwobbler> this came out of nowhere 4 me
[1:01:34] <+tigerfang86> S L O T H
[1:01:34] <munitalprats> start as ana!
[1:01:36] <$realm_forge> Vibrations make the orb resonate uncomfortably
[1:01:37] <+Sargon1stClass> Shout out fellow assyrians that recognized that tablet in options lol
[1:01:38] <%SaiyanShoto> Your old man bones can’t handle the vibration?
[1:01:38] <duckmeister7> i put the vibrating controller on my gooch
[1:01:39] <%IncredibleMeh> SLOTH
[1:01:41] <pixelkenj> Trials of Mana on Switch had every vibration go off at max strength for some reason
[1:01:41] <+skm742> (at least spelunky classic)
[1:01:42] <munitalprats> NOPE!
[1:01:42] <%DappercatEsquire> no
[1:01:43] <Vortigon> Anuhhhh
[1:01:43] <s1rcuit> plus I feel like vibration drains batteries faster
[1:01:43] <%heartlesshealer> Some do!
[1:01:44] <LoneFonte> nope
[1:01:44] <ergulor> No
[1:01:44] <TOONFOOD> nope
[1:01:45] <+skm742> no diff for chars
[1:01:45] <%Agami23> no
[1:01:45] <%Mendin> SLOTH
[1:01:46] <0rond> skins only
[1:01:46] <revoltingimp> Crendor?
[1:01:47] <+tigerfang86> just aesthetic
[1:01:47] <$dalmek> only appearance
[1:01:47] <@SSaryn> Just skins
[1:01:47] <+MortXII> Will you play the new D2 expansion?
[1:01:48] <%AzureGale> The only time vibration is acceptable is with a vibrator
[1:01:48] <aeonicvector> Asthethics
[1:01:48] <munitalprats> only aesthetics
[1:01:48] <Goergorion> is that a fucking mime!
[1:01:49] <%BigCoffee> same
[1:01:49] <TOONFOOD> just style
[1:01:52] <%heartlesshealer> You will notice when you get robot
[1:01:53] <Portal_Operater> Nope.
[1:01:54] <Grandma_Amari> Ana is cute as heck
[1:01:54] <+michingmallecho> I love vibration when it’s not obnoxious. The rumble in the Xbox elite controller sounds and feels weird and annoying
[1:01:54] <%GingaNZ> same, no upgrades in the game
[1:01:58] <AlmondRoll> purely visual
[1:01:59] <Vortigon> she whip
[1:02:03] <thatperson462> it depends on how spunky they are
[1:02:04] <AlmondRoll> Ana is indeed cute
[1:02:06] <duckmeister7> don't spoil the game chat
[1:02:06] <munitalprats> HEY THAT WHIP AINT THAT BAD
[1:02:10] <0rond> it's a castlevania whip
[1:02:11] <+tigerfang86> LORE
[1:02:16] <+tigerfang86> LORE LUNKY
[1:02:16] <AlmondRoll> Ana is going to die horribly so many times
[1:02:17] <aeonicvector> Do note the whip hits BEHIND you before infront of you
[1:02:17] <Grandma_Amari> But can you parry
[1:02:18] <duckmeister7> don't tell him about unlocks
[1:02:19] <henrydrunkenlyplays117> has he played the first one?
[1:02:19] <Vortigon> PridePog
[1:02:22] <mellorolo> pat why arent we cheesing out genshin impact?!

[1:02:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @henrydrunkenlyplays117 chat told him to skip the first game
[1:02:44] <$Bane_Kaikyo> Vibration done poorly is the main thing.... shitty vibration used correctly can be soooo goood
[1:02:46] <ShichiNoBushi> So next generation.
[1:02:48] <%Fooguwu> loud?
[1:02:52] <pixelkenj> how long will pat survive place your bets

[1:08:46] <+wydamn> So basically in the first game you had a chick instead of a dog, but they felt that was too objectifying and patched in the option to replace her with a dude or a dog. It looks like you only get pets in this version.

[1:35:20] <munitalprats> this game is HARD
[1:35:20] <digaogrunge> EYES UP HERE PAT
[1:35:25] <%SomeSageAdvice> this game sure loves spawning stuff right next to the entrance huh?

[1:35:30] <+tigerfang86> LERN
[1:35:30] <munitalprats> its not straight up
[1:35:30] <+skm742> first world is always the hardest
[1:35:33] <DazzlingFuhrer> you can throw up or down, yeah
[1:35:34] <munitalprats> but it is a high throw
[1:35:35] <%Ne1son> sneaky arrow traps
[1:35:40] <%depressed_skeleton> What??
[1:35:40] <%AzureGale> why u no take arrow
[1:35:41] <%bevyrage> enemies being able to spawn in pots is why you throw them into walls instead of whipping them. also enemies can't become active until they touch the floor so it even buys you time!
[1:35:42] <+tigerfang86> don't give up skeleton
[1:35:46] <Vortigon> s-sexy skeleton?
[1:35:47] <henrydrunkenlyplays117> pat got to pay attention to surroundings
[1:35:50] <%heartlesshealer> not -straight- up, but upwards yeah
[1:35:52] <%Taisuru> Stop running into anemies
[1:35:53] <+skm742> even knowing everything, arrow traps are hyper lethal.
[1:35:53] <+Awereica> has pat played the first one?

[1:39:41] <+skm742> monsters should work on altar, but are worth less points than pupper
[1:39:42] <%Mendin> If only he had the cum jar
[1:39:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so if Pat makes it to World 2-1, and dies, he goes backt o World 1-1?
[1:39:45] <munitalprats> you throw your rock? go get that thing back!

[1:39:56] <jware97> 21
[1:39:57] <DazzlingFuhrer> pat, you can trigger arrow traps with ropes.
[1:39:59] <Vortigon> why??
[1:40:01] <derekwst3> what if that was elmo
[1:40:01] <Sain_127> also im weirdly addicted watching streams of this game
[1:40:01] <%sleepers1mulant> and F
[1:40:02] <TOONFOOD> gc7Pb
[1:40:04] <%WorldsBestPanda> LOL
[1:40:05] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt grapple ropes can set off arrow traps
[1:40:06] <thelonechris> How many times did Pat die at this point?
[1:40:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @PatStaresAt Bombs can be used to set off arrow traps
[1:40:12] <munitalprats> there is a quick restart option in the gameplay settings
[1:40:12] <Sain_127> am i a sadist
[1:40:13] <jware97> 22
[1:40:13] <Infeirno23> @shinobiphoenix thats how most roguelikes work
[1:40:15] <+skm742> alive pupper is worth 8 kali points. dead bodies count for half
[1:40:15] <AlmondRoll> @PatStaresAt you can turn on instant restart from pause in options
[1:40:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yeah, thiss game is never getting my money
[1:40:18] <%Laecerelius> Guess Pat hasn't learned how to trigger arrow traps safely
[1:40:18] <%heartlesshealer> more than one
[1:40:19] <henrydrunkenlyplays117> @thelonechris yes
[1:40:22] <%shruke> you can set off arrows with a rope in an emergency
[1:40:38] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt you can turn on instant restart from pause in options
[1:40:38] <%heartlesshealer> I love this weird puzzle platform stuff

[1:40:42] <Khorneflakes_> cohhM Pat
[1:40:42] <Infeirno23> its the same with binding of isaac, you die you start over
[1:40:46] <AlmondRoll> @ShinobiPhoenix this game is all knowledge checkpoints
[1:40:47] <%Mendin> @PatStaresAt The arrow shot from a trap is a throwable item, and rocks are indestructible
[1:41:01] <%AzureGale> ghosts cant eat
[1:41:13] <omenesia> reuse your rock friends
[1:41:17] <Infeirno23> and luck LUL
[1:41:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Dead Cells and Hades are the most Rogue I enjoy
[1:41:22] <+skm742> interesting. Do cursed enemies die in one hit? (curse is new, don't know those mechanics yet)
[1:41:22] <$RagingMath> Yo that is one SLICK Rogue like border
[1:41:23] <munitalprats> you can reuse the rock you throw!
[1:41:25] <Jrocy247> So are you basically timed through each floor with that ghost popping up?
[1:41:27] <munitalprats> just always carry something to throw

[1:42:09] <derekwst3> Pat i can tell that you want to play banjo
[1:42:10] <+skm742> Ghost only shows up through ghost aggro events (break curse pot, etc) or 3 min

[1:57:56] <DazzlingFuhrer> the dog can take a few hits before getting snuffed.
[1:57:56] <wraithtaker162> not as long as you're careful with your yeets
[1:57:57] <aeonicvector> dog only takes damage from instances you would, same HP as you aswell
[1:57:58] <ashbirds> dog has as much HP as you do

[2:00:47] <paris750000> Running over the gaps works like Mario rules
[2:00:47] <+skm742> no, everyone is stupid. it's not the stun state protecting the dog. Pets don't take contact damage from enemy contact.
[2:01:07] <munitalprats> pets dont take contact damage

[2:25:08] <silentblast93> STOP DOING THAT
[2:25:09] <+Lord_of_all_Edges> it sets things on fire
[2:25:10] <RickSaintRiot> unlike in most games, you can actually Buy things at the Shop with the Currency you collect in levels
[2:25:10] <%PaladinDupre> BIG HUMBUS
[2:25:13] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt enable twitch+ emotes so that we may laugh at you brother
[2:25:17] <%Parapattern> Big Humbus Chungus
[2:25:20] <%Agami23> you thought, and that was the first mistake
[2:25:21] <clockworknait1> If you mess with one shop owner they all hate you in eveey level for the rest of your "life"
[2:25:25] <rcand9> embrace the humbus
[2:25:25] <%Mendin> Take a deaep breath and regain your Humbusity
[2:25:28] <$Timesteel> you need a gun or a machete to kill shop keep easily
[2:25:30] <munitalprats> its him waking up
[2:25:31] <iamtheTwitchghost> ye
[2:25:32] <frostybee> Pat feeling the big humbus LUL
[2:25:35] <%Taisuru> Pat just play Gaijin Impact
[2:25:35] <Vcom7418> When is ever attacking a shopkeeper in a roguelike as simple as "hit him and I can get his shit for free"?
[2:25:36] <rcand9> breath the humbus
[2:25:36] <munitalprats> its the sound his eyes make when he's blinking
[2:25:38] <nepwar> humbus chungus vs hubis pubis
[2:25:38] <+deviljhojho_> Local man humiliated by game for kids. J-just like me tomatoPain ....
[2:25:41] <silentblast93> CAUSE ONCE YOU STEAL FROM THE SHOP YOU CANT GET ANY THING ELSER
[2:25:45] <penitentpentwitch> This feels like a game designed to break Pat's goblins and it's breaking Pat in the process
[2:25:46] <%heartlesshealer> @s_xylocalsingles Pat has tried to enable them lots of times and twitch just says no
[2:25:51] <AlmondRoll> @Timesteel power pack would have worked too, he just didn't commit
[2:25:52] <RickSaintRiot> when a shop keeper gets angry, you really FEEL how upset he is. they really convey his negative feelings thru the interface
[2:25:53] <munitalprats> BREAK CRATES
[2:25:54] <+MisterAvry> this game can be a real kick in the humbus
[2:25:55] <munitalprats> THEY GOT GOOD SHIT

[2:25:56] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp

[2:38:47] <derekwst3> throw fire at the big chill, to warm it up
[2:38:50] <ThirdPersonPhil> freeze ray is a free kill on the shop keeper
[2:38:58] <munitalprats> SPIKE SHOES ARE THE HOMIE
[2:39:01] <%Taisuru> More stomp damage
[2:39:01] <+skm742> very good stomp attack
[2:39:02] <RickSaintRiot> that's why it's called "urination" when you piss. because piss is gold

[2:44:23] <iamtheTwitchghost> it makes sense
[2:44:23] <McAngrimStein> turkeys can't climb and dogs can't look up
[2:44:26] <+dawsfloss> can they IRL?
[2:44:28] <munitalprats> paste yeyeye!

[2:53:33] <%AFlyingTaco1> @tonfirean It's reminiscent of some themes from the Mario & Luigi games, but I'm not sure which ones exactly.
[2:53:34] <%Mendin> ! SANITY AT RISK !
[2:53:34] <%sleepers1mulant> spelunkey is the minecraft of sex
[2:53:35] <RaidenRising> MY DICK HURTS
[2:53:41] <munitalprats> slow. down.
[2:53:43] <faldin> LUL
[2:53:43] <iamtheTwitchghost> LUL
[2:53:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Somehow this is worse than the Ori and the Blind Forest stream.
[2:53:48] <iamtheTwitchghost> wow
[2:53:48] <jware97> 61
[2:53:48] <%heartlesshealer> take that, Patrick
[2:53:48] <RickSaintRiot> fun fact: wombo combos are statistically worse than regular combos
[2:53:49] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:53:51] <penitentpentwitch> Skeleton got revenge
[2:53:55] <+MisterAvry> Dazed. Reeling. About to break.
[2:53:56] <VJdarkworld> LUL
[2:53:57] <AlmondRoll> pat is tilted off his rocker and it's generating many many hilarious deaths
[2:53:58] <Mr_Strut> mortis
[2:53:58] <jware97> come on 69
[2:53:59] <+Lord_of_all_Edges> THIEF
[2:54:00] <%heartlesshealer> but yeah, skeleton can do things
[2:54:06] <OldManDeckardCain> this game hears you talking shit instantly
[2:54:07] <%Ranryu692> some of these deaths are actual knee-slappers
[2:54:11] <+melanthia_> what's the farthest floor so far?
[2:54:12] <+Mmffgg147> Skeleton sends his regards
[2:54:12] <%depressed_skeleton> s-sorry pat..
[2:54:15] <dapperskeleton69> you just mygged that guy
[2:54:15] <MartyFun11> Did pat switch default from run to walk?
[2:54:16] <%SomeSageAdvice> this game is vicious but i havent seen it chew someone up so hard before, this seems sadistic at best
[2:54:16] <KaliasTV> Did nobody warn you that Spelunky would end your life?
[2:54:22] <%sleepers1mulant> this game is inflicting darkest dungeon stress stacks on pat
[2:54:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @melanthia_ 1-5 I think?
[2:54:29] <munitalprats> pretty sure he got to the end of 1-3 and died
[2:54:36] <munitalprats> he did NOT get to 1-5 because 1-5 doesnt exist.
[2:54:37] <Aydarkzero> hows Pat doing?
[2:54:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sleepers1mulant This game is inflicting more Darkest Dungeon stress stacks than ACTUAL Darkest Dungeon
[2:54:42] <VJdarkworld> has pat played spelunky 1? cus spelunky 2 has a major difficulty spike over that game
[2:54:43] <Ids560> 1-4 is the end
[2:54:45] <iamtheTwitchghost> SAVED PogChamp
[2:54:48] <%AFlyingTaco1> Yeah this theme definitely shares an identical beat with Partners in Time's Yoshi Island
[2:54:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> 'Greed'
[2:54:53] <%heartlesshealer> lizard eat dung beetle
[2:54:55] <munitalprats> what an excellent use of resources
[2:54:59] <McAngrimStein> ? ? ?
[2:54:59] <suikudo> why?
[2:55:00] <+AbnormalVoid> He ate the BUG
[2:55:00] <munitalprats> spend a bomb and a rope to get hit
[2:55:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> PAT JUST LEAVE THE LEVEL OH MY FUCKING GOD
[2:55:00] <RaidenRising> KEK
[2:55:01] <reonome> GREED
[2:55:01] <Xeno351> why tho LUL
[2:55:01] <@SoFarFetched> wow Pat LUL
[2:55:03] <Zooperton> THE GREED
[2:55:04] <iamtheTwitchghost> WHY
[2:55:04] <+MisterAvry> learn no lessons
[2:55:07] <frostybee> the greed LUL
[2:55:11] <%chiazam> ??????
[2:55:13] <munitalprats> NO LESSONS LEARNED
[2:55:17] <penitentpentwitch> Objective: Reach 1-4
[2:55:18] <suikudo> you dont need to get all the gold
[2:55:18] <%sleepers1mulant> psaGoblin THE GREED psaGoblin
[2:55:18] <munitalprats> *ALWAYS BE CARRYING*
[2:55:19] <+EscoSul> I did it! *punched in the face*
[2:55:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you DO NOT need to 100% this game on your first run.
[2:55:23] <+SimplyPandaz> Has pat made it to 1-3? even
[2:55:23] <%Parapattern> I wait right outside your door with a bat and hit you as soon as you walk out
[2:55:24] <munitalprats> THE ROCK IS REUSABLE
[2:55:27] <s1rcuit> this music reminds me of Yoshi's Island in Paper Mario
[2:55:28] <+Undenizen> you should stick with bad runs from time to time.
[2:55:29] <nepwar> pats been stuck at the first stage for how long now
[2:55:30] <RickSaintRiot> does he actually know the thing about the Ghost?
[2:55:30] <suikudo> trading hearts for loot is always bad
[2:55:31] <iamtheTwitchghost> even if you get a perfect run here, the RNG will fuck you over the next level
[2:55:33] <PunishedChrisRedfield> He's beginning to achieve.
[2:55:34] <+aversal_ammar> Remember kids, never learn
[2:55:36] <%Agami23> i hope pat at least gets to 1-4 this stream
[2:55:41] <AlmondRoll> this is a 1-1 stream
[2:55:43] <+melanthia_> 1-4 shortcut in this game is really nice
[2:55:46] <%chiazam> Pat is prioritizing greed over survival, with expected results
[2:55:52] <munitalprats> yeah instantly restart
[2:55:53] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt if you were playing banjo kazooie you could be talking to LOGGO the living toilet
[2:55:53] <iamtheTwitchghost> lmao
[2:55:55] <McAngrimStein> SOME ONE 1-1
[2:55:58] <AlmondRoll> Quillback is gonna fuck Pat so hard he'll ragequit the game LUL @Agami23
[2:55:59] <munitalprats> because you could just die instantly the next floor you do get a perfect run on
[2:56:04] <MKII> skill is a bigger factor in this game than RNG and that feel bad
[2:56:09] <munitalprats> JUST CARRY SOMETHNG
[2:56:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Easy to see?
[2:56:15] <%ThirdWelles> So the random sprinting into areas you haven't see? Yeah stop doing that probably
[2:56:16] <munitalprats> if you are holding onto say, a rock or tool or corpse
[2:56:20] <+skm742> they're why I told you to carry an item if you can.
[2:56:21] <lesserkarl> IF ONLY THERE WERE SOME KIND OF ITEMS YOU COULD THROW AT IT
[2:56:21] <munitalprats> you can bait them ALL day.
[2:56:25] <%ThirdWelles> haven't seen*
[2:56:31] <%Mendin> Remember how our first advi ce was "Always Be Carrying"
[2:56:33] <ashbirds> @PatStaresAt did you know you can whip the arrows out of the air?
[2:56:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe not sprint at all, that might be a good idea too
[2:56:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> PANIK
[2:56:44] <%chiazam> Death by GHOST
[2:56:47] <+melanthia_> is autosprint still on?
[2:56:49] <+aversal_ammar> Pat better really start worrying. Vtubers are coming for his job after this stream.
[2:56:54] <jware97> 62
[2:56:54] <VJdarkworld> you can throw objects to trigger arrow traps
[2:56:55] <iamtheTwitchghost> :(
[2:56:55] <suikudo> stop with the ghost urn!
[2:56:59] <%chiazam> NEVERMIND
[2:57:00] <+skm742> no, carry was second advice. First advice was walk XD
[2:57:02] <iamtheTwitchghost> pat's losing it
[2:57:04] <MartyFun11> It gets a lot easier if you switch it to walk as default instead of run
[2:57:04] <%DappercatEsquire> i left for like 45 minutes, is Pat still eating shit?
[2:57:06] <suikudo> 9 times out of 10 it will kill you
[2:57:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you are playing yourself the game isn't even doing anything anymore.
[2:57:07] <jellssssss20> Wow I can imagine Pat's brain screaming
[2:57:07] <jware97> 63
[2:57:11] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[2:57:13] <Xeno351> game literally has look before you leap as a built in function and hes just running in blind LUL
[2:57:17] <munitalprats> just slow down pat
[2:57:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DappercatEsquire He is having a legitimate mental breakdown.
[2:57:22] <munitalprats> you're running into areas you HAVENT EXPLORED
[2:57:23] <jellssssss20> @DappercatEsquire Absolutely
[2:57:24] <%sleepers1mulant> what was the point of turning off autorun if hes just going to run everywhere
[2:57:32] <+aversal_ammar> GO FASTER
[2:57:32] <reonome> 90% of the time pat summons the ghost he dies by his own hand LUL
[2:57:36] <RickSaintRiot> secret path to fire? how unrealistic.
[2:57:40] <%chiazam> Chat we're not seeing 2-1 are we?
[2:57:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sleepers1mulant GOBLINS
[2:57:42] <%Parapattern> Woolie is gonna get an earful of this come Monday
[2:57:42] <RickSaintRiot> a fire? in a cave? my immersion is broken
[2:57:43] <+aversal_ammar> BIG SPEEDS
[2:57:48] <Xeno351> LUL
[2:57:48] <%heartlesshealer> Can you see why everyone was so hype for Spelunky?
[2:57:49] <munitalprats> grab the rock again lytNOTIKETHIS
[2:57:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you don't need that pot
[2:57:52] <%CalderGaming> the JUGGLES

[2:57:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> PAT LEAVE IT ALONE
[2:57:58] <+Robo_Wizard1> why though
[2:58:00] <JanusII> Pat...slow down.
[2:58:00] <%reluctant_monkey> Nice.
[2:58:02] <+melanthia_> yeah if you're defaulting to sprint turn it off
[2:58:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nuuuuuu
[2:58:05] <%Chimeraelite> oh god he's breaking
[2:58:05] <jware97> another one

[2:58:10] <%Chimeraelite> LUL
[2:58:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> You DO NOT need every single piece of gold in a level
[2:58:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> today is Pat's Birthday?
[2:58:12] <LoneFonte> will we get to 100 today?
[2:58:13] <VJdarkworld> this game needs a combo meter
[2:58:14] <jellssssss20> Why do you keep trying to hang onto the pushy totems..?
[2:58:14] <Xeno351> one of the best tips is to just constantly hold anything
[2:58:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> HAppy Birthday Pat!
[2:58:20] <ashbirds> you is baba
[2:58:21] <iamtheTwitchghost> focus on surviving
[2:58:26] <+MisterAvry> Make sure you sprint face first into the exact same obstacle that just damaged you immediately
[2:58:27] <suikudo> @PatStaresAt slow down!
[2:58:28] <McAngrimStein> what if I told you gold is almost worthless
[2:58:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Pounding it......Pounding it................Pounding it
[2:58:36] <%chiazam> On my Mama, just focus on getting to the exit
[2:58:48] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby_Sauce subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! shit, i'm 20 months old i guess
[2:58:48] <%Captainahab_37> sup everybody
[2:58:48] <suikudo> for the love of
[2:58:50] <AlmondRoll> whipping pots, not always always holding a rock or skull, not looking before jumping down a pit...
[2:58:51] <lesserkarl> why
[2:58:52] <+Mmffgg147> You have to bait out the totem's super first
[2:58:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you deserve this

[2:59:16] <JanusII> Dog lived.
[2:59:17] <%sleepers1mulant> played yourself
[2:59:18] <PunishedChrisRedfield> All that matters is the dog lived!
[2:59:18] <+ladomania> throw the dog
[2:59:19] <$Dakuu75> lol
[2:59:21] <Aydarkzero> FeelsBadMan
[2:59:22] <ashbirds> the dog isn't worth more than your life
[2:59:22] <RushUnplugged> it's like you guys have never seen Pat play anything, you think he CAN leave gold around
[2:59:22] <vulkans2> the dog made it PogChamp
[2:59:24] <RickSaintRiot> big hitbox on that ghost. pretty good ghost physics
[2:59:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> What is Pat's plan?
[2:59:30] <+SimplyPandaz> Just chuck the dog through stuff

[2:59:38] <%Taisuru> Pat, dog is only worth 1 hp, remember that
[2:59:38] <%Captainahab_37> I sucked at the first one so I'll live vicariously through pat this time and play it like that
[2:59:41] <+MisterAvry> I vote to leave the Ghost Pots alone, too
[2:59:41] <%sleepers1mulant> abandon the mind goblins about the ghost gem please god
[2:59:43] <%Broand> nooo pat don't develop new goblins
[2:59:45] <suikudo> spelunky is hard but not this fucking hard jesus
[2:59:45] <%Captainahab_37> shit I still suck
[2:59:49] <dan_g_v> Pat's plan is to win
[2:59:51] <%ThirdWelles> @PatStaresAt I can actively see you learning how each thing can kill you, and then not doing anything about it
[2:59:52] <munitalprats> the rock is the peoples champ
[2:59:55] <munitalprats> GO BACK AND GET THE ROCK
[2:59:56] <+Lord_of_all_Edges> That snake was just vibing
[2:59:59] <%CalderGaming> I feel like the roguelikes intro animation should change to reflect the speed at which pat is inflicting death upon himself
[3:00:06] <+aversal_ammar> Yeah this is definitely a Pat thing
[3:00:13] <%chiazam> NO LEAVE

[3:00:48] <LoneFonte> less chances to die
[3:00:49] <ThirdPersonPhil> Kill the shop keeper

[3:00:50] <iosephe> Dying is worse
[3:00:53] <iamtheTwitchghost> HUMBUS
[3:00:56] <nepwar> you have to actually pass the stage to get to the shopkeep LUL
[3:00:56] <%chiazam> Not being able to buy things is a fact of LIFE
[3:00:56] <+Robo_Wizard1> the whole game is risk management
[3:00:57] <reonome> because you suck and die too easily
[3:00:57] <+MisterAvry> you never use the things you buy at the shop because you die right away
[3:01:00] <frostybee> Because you keep dying due to your lack of humbusity
[3:01:05] <suikudo> you cant afford anything good anyway!
[3:01:07] <RickSaintRiot> live and learn. you're dying too quickly to even learn what's worth buying
[3:01:07] <ThirdPersonPhil> Shild Splat him
[3:01:11] <+aversal_ammar> Pat YOU CANT EVEN LIVE TO THE SHOP

[3:01:28] <RickSaintRiot> fun fact, turkeys love being ridden
[3:01:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, all of the gold you are dying for is pointless because you are not LIVING long enough to make it to the shop in the first place.
[3:01:30] <McAngrimStein> hmm
[3:01:32] <+DrT0M_> 2 things, first is you can steal from the shop. Second is, until you're clearing the area fairly regularly, that should be your goal over everything else
[3:01:41] <RickSaintRiot> they get off on it, the sick fukkers
[3:01:44] <munitalprats> rope time

[3:03:08] <%Captainahab_37> you can do it
[3:03:08] <+Mmffgg147> bomb the turkeys tbh
[3:03:09] <+MisterAvry> and now he killed you
[3:03:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> YOU HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME
[3:03:10] <%chiazam> HUBRIS
[3:03:10] <dj_arashi_rora> damn son
[3:03:13] <%Totally_Not_Toby> you brok them out!
[3:03:13] <McAngrimStein> yeah that was much better than leaving
[3:03:13] <RickSaintRiot> this is pretty incredible turkey breeder anger persistence though
[3:03:13] <%Captainahab_37> nevermind
[3:03:14] <%Jekado> ULTRA COMBOOOOOO
[3:03:14] <+XxBTExX> get fucked
[3:03:15] <%sleepers1mulant> JESUS
[3:03:15] <Feo_Leo> wall bounce
[3:03:18] <nepwar> motherfucker just threw you like a ragdoll
[3:03:18] <%PaladinDupre> KUNG FU
[3:03:19] <RickSaintRiot> they really thought of everything
[3:03:19] <%TOONFOOD> Turkey man ain't no joke
[3:03:20] <ashbirds> humbus
[3:03:21] <+MisterAvry> what did you get from the shop tho?
[3:03:26] <SeafoodTime> you violated the NAP
[3:03:26] <Mr_Strut> air juggles
[3:03:28] <popcultureaficionado> LUL you blow up his turkey coup of course he'd be pissed
[3:03:31] <ShinNoisyCat> absolutely bodied
[3:03:32] <Jrocy247> I love how Pat keeps making these Obvious Mistakes and keeps going "WHY?!? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!?!?"
[3:03:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, whose gonna be the one to make a "How NOT to play Spelunk 2" compilation out of this?
[3:03:40] <+skm742> I haven't played enough to know: Does Yang give anything beyond trash gold ever?
[3:03:43] <jware97> 67
[3:03:48] <+EscoSul> BUT BABA
[3:03:51] <Ids560> he can give a crate
[3:03:55] <RickSaintRiot> libertarians be like: i'm a sleepy boy who needs his N.A.P.
[3:03:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Jrocy247 HOW COULD THIS BE!?
[3:04:02] <+melanthia_> yang will sell turkeys later
[3:04:03] <AlmondRoll> I'm gonna spoil it straight up, Yang's turkey quest is never worth it
[3:04:04] <DazzlingFuhrer> Yang's basically never worth it.
[3:04:06] <%AFlyingTaco1> Do you get gold for completing the level?
[3:04:07] <jware97> 68
[3:04:07] <McAngrimStein> I don't think Yang is ever worth it unless the turkeys are in easy places relative to him
[3:04:07] <iamtheTwitchghost> NICE
[3:04:08] <+seoliart> F
[3:04:08] <+XxBTExX> nailed it
[3:04:21] <VJdarkworld> spiked it
[3:04:21] <%chiazam> MmmhmmMM
[3:04:23] <ashbirds> yang's only worth it as an investment
[3:04:25] <Bagelborn> It's always worth it to kill Yang since he doesn't have an angry faction
[3:04:26] <+Mmffgg147> @skm742 Sometimes crates. blowing up the turkeys is usually better
[3:04:28] <+aversal_ammar> “DSPat Plays Spelunky 2”
[3:04:28] <+Undenizen> man, those spokes are NOT your friend, huh?
[3:04:30] <LoneFonte> are ya winnin, pat?
[3:04:30] <popcultureaficionado> close to being really good there
[3:04:31] <munitalprats> go slow.
[3:04:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This is like watching a Bike Crash compilation
[3:04:33] <rekinom> This is quickly turning into pat cry's at
[3:04:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is this the worst the mind goblins have ever been?
[3:04:35] <ShinNoisyCat> ah man but that was the run
[3:04:37] <%Mendin> Big Humbus
[3:04:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dark Side Pat
[3:04:38] <+trav2_> has pat gotten out of the mines ynet?
[3:04:42] <%ClericOfSparda> This game seems pretty hard
[3:04:42] <munitalprats> its almost worth it just to kill the turkeys with bombs
[3:04:45] <%Parapattern> Has the humbus set in yet?
[3:04:45] <%YabbaTroll> pat just slow the f down holy hell
[3:04:46] <iamtheTwitchghost> holy shit it's been 3 hours?
[3:04:47] <Ids560> no
[3:04:48] <munitalprats> because they give you roast turkey
[3:04:50] <+skm742> @Mmffgg147 Got it!
[3:04:50] <munitalprats> which gives you health
[3:04:53] <Feo_Leo> I love the spindash lizards
[3:04:54] <%PaladinDupre> he had the spin
[3:04:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @trav2_ No because he's dying trying to get every single treasure and also trying to speed run it
[3:05:03] <LoneFonte> @trav2_ not even 1-4
[3:05:03] <McAngrimStein> yeah, bringing turkeys together and bombing them is more worth it than Yang
[3:05:06] <+Smathiss> Has he made it to 2-1?
[3:05:10] <RickSaintRiot> good that he learned about the arrow traps though
[3:05:14] <jware97> can I get a nice in chat for 69
[3:05:15] <iamtheTwitchghost> only 1-3
[3:05:15] <munitalprats> COMBO'd
[3:05:16] <AlmondRoll> 2 slow
[3:05:16] <ShinNoisyCat> holy shit
[3:05:18] <+seoliart> wow Pat sucks at this game
[3:05:19] <@SoFarFetched> nice
[3:05:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Smathiss He hasn't even made it to 1-4
[3:05:21] <%chiazam> @Smathiss NO
[3:05:21] <reonome> ANGRYPAT
[3:05:21] <ChangelingBard> :O
[3:05:22] <+aversal_ammar> @smathiss no lol
[3:05:23] <nepwar> BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[3:05:29] <+melanthia_> at this point the roast turkeys are def a better option. extra hearts while you get used to the bs
[3:05:29] <%PaladinDupre> the ol 1 - 2
[3:05:30] <SomeAsianDood> learn the matchup pat Kappa
[3:05:30] <%sleepers1mulant> this is eliciting the same reaction from me as those 11 foot 8 bridge crash videos
[3:05:32] <Portal_Operater> just do your best.
[3:05:36] <Mr_Strut> Ginger gets pounded live
[3:05:36] <%luketrapwalker> Thought that was Elmo Jebaited
[3:05:37] <+aversal_ammar> ANGRY BOI
[3:05:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's good, slow is good.
[3:05:40] <%AFlyingTaco1> So when he dies, does the area reset itself each time?
[3:05:40] <ShinNoisyCat> this is the run
[3:05:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> No run, all slow
[3:05:43] <+trav2_> everyone sucks at the game at first it's hard af
[3:05:48] <%GarbageNirvana> AngriestPat would have cleared that
[3:05:49] <McAngrimStein> though I don't think he knows about bombing turkeys
[3:05:52] <iamtheTwitchghost> @AFlyingTaco1 yes
[3:05:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @trav2_ He's been at it for 3+ hours...

[3:06:23] <AlmondRoll> I've never seen somebody get bodied by a bat that hard
[3:06:26] <%wydamn> Detroit: Become Humbus
[3:06:26] <Feo_Leo> This is the one
[3:06:28] <munitalprats> just drop a bomb
[3:06:34] <+aversal_ammar> @portal_operater not this hard
[3:06:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @KaliasTV It's because 50% of the deaths are out of greed or sprinting blindly, so yes we're making fun of h im.
[3:06:55] <%wydamn> that bat just made you its bitch
[3:06:57] <munitalprats> remember, ana cant climb 3 blocks high
[3:06:57] <+skm742> @PatStaresAt You can drop a rope off of a cliff by crouching next to it and using rope. This WILL set off arrow traps, so you don't need to burn a bomb.
[3:06:59] <munitalprats> DEAD
[3:06:59] <HailSeaser> f
[3:07:01] <jware97> 71

[3:07:16] <HailSeaser> pounded
[3:07:20] <munitalprats> people were complaining that the tiki traps didnt instantly kill you on floor 1
[3:07:24] <derekwst3> 29 more lives until he wants to play banjo kazooie
[3:07:25] <%Mendin> @BobTheDuck99 2hr
[3:07:25] <RickSaintRiot> arrows? in a trap? my immersion is broken
[3:07:27] <HailSeaser> yeah punch it back
[3:07:34] <+Smathiss> Ignore everything except the pet and items, and take the most direct route to the exit. Nothing is worth going out of your way to pick up at such a early stage of developing your skills and understanding of the game.
[3:07:50] <AlmondRoll> knowledge checkpoint achieved
[3:07:53] <PunishedChrisRedfield> Bomb in a chest is dirty.

[3:11:58] <%Mendin> Rage-shit confirmed
[3:12:00] <peyodogo> 72, whoa
[3:12:02] <HailSeaser> poor turkey
[3:12:06] <dynamic_funk> if i can get pnda to warrior in tekken you can learn this game
[3:12:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat does the same exact think Peach does when unexpected badness happens, he tries to SPRINT as fast as possible away from it right into actual death.
[3:12:09] <%Parapattern> Piss and shit ur pants in hate
[3:12:15] <RickSaintRiot> So, really, it's a Mind Goblin thing, isn't it
[3:12:29] <+aversal_ammar> Yo Pat is a real bro for not spoiling the rest of the Spelunky areas for us
[3:12:36] <%wydamn> how much is his piss boiling right now?
[3:12:36] <peyodogo> this game needs such a specific mindset to be good at and he's so far away from it
[3:12:42] <peyodogo> it's great
[3:12:43] <ShinNoisyCat> real cool guy that pat
[3:12:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @aversal_ammar LUL
[3:12:55] <AlmondRoll> Pat's doing about as well as expected honestly, slow but steady progress
[3:12:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @peyodogo Calm and not greedy.
[3:12:58] <RickSaintRiot> yeah props for not giving away anything about the story, guys.
[3:13:01] <HailSeaser> 5% boiling
[3:13:06] <%wydamn> @aversal_ammar psaSmug
[3:13:09] <munitalprats> Honestly, he isnt even doing that bad
[3:13:15] <munitalprats> we're kinda memeing a bit
[3:13:15] <AlmondRoll> might not be a 2nd stream of Spelunky but I hope he sticks with it
[3:13:15] <%TOONFOOD> Anyone who's played the game knows the feeling
[3:13:19] <peyodogo> he's not!
[3:13:19] <munitalprats> but he does need to slow down
[3:13:23] <+MisterAvry> there's a story?
[3:13:26] <+BobTheDuck99> Did Pat ever play Spelunky HD?
[3:13:26] <munitalprats> and he needs to start re-using the stuff he throws
[3:13:29] <munitalprats> like thr cosk
[3:13:31] <munitalprats> rocks*
[3:13:32] <DashXero> @munitalprats He really isn't doing badly.
[3:13:35] <RickSaintRiot> spelunky is at heart a story-driven experience, and that's fantastic
[3:13:38] <%sleepers1mulant> @AlmondRoll DEF not gonna be a 2nd stream
[3:13:43] <%GabeSweetMan> I feel that 99
[3:13:45] <%AFlyingTaco1> Wow Genshin Impact is a blatant Botw clone. Not that it's a bad thing but still.
[3:13:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @munitalprats About 50% of the time, it's just Spelunky being Spelunky, the rest of the time it's cause he's charging headlong into the unknown or trying to get the treasure instead of just leaving.
[3:13:49] <AlmondRoll> Spelunky 2 added a whole bunch of new lore
[3:13:49] <peyodogo> he needs to pivot away from money first, resources second
[3:13:55] <nepwar> I've never been more sure of a game never being streamed again
[3:14:01] <+Mmffgg147> Needs to get a firm grasp on his humbis
[3:14:01] <munitalprats> when you're at the exit
[3:14:03] <DashXero> @munitalprats I saw a guy play this who played the first one to death, and he had a whole stream of barely managing to get through the first few levels.
[3:14:05] <+skm742> As the person who inflicted Baba, I'm loving that they're playing my favorite game
[3:14:08] <munitalprats> you gotta LEAVE
[3:14:15] <+ChocolateVGZ> did I miss the game
[3:14:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Mmffgg147 The humbis is in Ontario at this point.
[3:14:26] <RickSaintRiot> You have to imagine it like Jotaro pressing a button and dying
[3:14:28] <PunishedChrisRedfield> He thinks this is hard, try playing the original source from 2008 on a keyboard. That's true pain.
[3:14:38] <+aversal_ammar> I think if he walked and looked around more, threw pots, used ropes to trigger traps, and left levels early, he would probably not have that hard a time.
[3:14:41] <HailSeaser> @Mmffgg147 he's getting firm grasp on something right now
[3:14:42] <%sleepers1mulant> really like these humbus persistence mechanics though, hes still going at it like a champ
[3:14:43] <RickSaintRiot> and then being like "Yeah, I pretty much figured out how the entire game works"
[3:14:47] <AlmondRoll> @DashXero 2's hard tweaked to fuck over veterans specifically, so I get that
[3:14:55] <%CalderGaming> good
[3:15:00] <%arancet> BIG HUMBUS
[3:15:00] <%sleepers1mulant> BABY

[3:25:10] <Simsandwich> Pat, this is a normal amount of deaths, just gotta start getting used to all the patterns
[3:25:12] <RickSaintRiot> especially how much they love gold. an excellent reference to the movie CONGO
[3:25:13] <%ChocolateVGZ> Is it still a sacrifice to Kali or are they trying to be vague fictional gods now lol

[3:26:08] <AlmondRoll> Spelunky is still the hodgepodge melting pot of mythology you know it to be
[3:26:09] <%sleepers1mulant> @duckmeister7 SourPls
[3:26:14] <+aversal_ammar> You can drop pots

[3:27:30] <+cincysanta> Did any one tell Paige there’d be so many skeletons?
[3:27:34] <RickSaintRiot> the fact that the player character ends up being the end boss's daughter? pretty crazy twist, imo
[3:27:36] <%chiazam> no
[3:27:38] <@SoFarFetched> @theotrainwreck He already did
[3:27:41] <HailSeaser> press f for turkey

[3:28:29] <%ChocolateVGZ> bold of him to stick with it
[3:28:30] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah he wasn't a fan of how Ror2 plays.
[3:28:31] <%ClericOfSparda> So he's just walled himself off now?
[3:28:37] <Mr_Strut> He's beginning to believe
[3:28:38] <%ClericOfSparda> No more shopkeep?
[3:28:42] <%DappercatEsquire> what was your plan?

[3:29:26] <+cincysanta> Elmo is the damsel
[3:29:27] <%bevyrage> the very first roguelike was called 'Rogue'

[3:29:48] <thisisacoolguy> @PatStaresAt Did you know if you float with the cape you can land on the spikes?
[3:29:48] <%Broand> I can't wait to hear about this on the podcase

[3:30:12] <%sleepers1mulant> these baby persistence mechanics
[3:30:13] <%wydamn> Elmo looks concerned
[3:30:14] <OkamiDude15> emotional support doggo
[3:30:14] <%ChocolateVGZ> For some reason easily avoidable damage that is like 1 hp is almost worse than catastrophic damage that you can't avoid
[3:30:17] <Khorneflakes_> cohhD Elmo demands attention
[3:30:18] <ShinNoisyCat> it's only a matter of time before objects are thrown
[3:30:26] <@SoFarFetched> @theotrainwreck last year of april,he played Crypt of the NecroDancer and RoR2, it should be on youtube.
[3:30:27] <duckmeister7> do NOT give him the humbus
[3:30:27] <%reluctant_monkey> humbus = risk management?

[3:31:25] <derekwst3> it saved you
[3:31:38] <%sleepers1mulant> humbus transferred through kisses
[3:31:39] <RickSaintRiot> fun fact: all the skeletons in this level believe in God
[3:31:45] <Grandma_Amari> Puppo's licking pat's bicep to clean that growing layer of salt off
[3:31:46] <%weissguard> This is Pat's Pet Power Up
[3:31:50] <ShinNoisyCat> you can do it

[3:31:58] <jware97> 75 deaths
[3:31:58] <%ChocolateVGZ> Well not like that
[3:31:58] <DazzlingFuhrer> could've pushed the blocks
[3:31:59] <derekwst3> why?
[3:31:59] <iamtheTwitchghost> nice
[3:32:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you did it
[3:32:02] <Ids560> so you push the blocks out beforehand
[3:32:02] <dots4eyes> Elmo looked away because humbus
[3:32:02] <ShinNoisyCat> nailed it ezpz
[3:32:03] <duckmeister7> MORTIS

[3:32:09] <nepwar> move the metal box first dum dum
[3:32:13] <ShinNoisyCat> s p e e d
[3:32:13] <iamtheTwitchghost> push the blocks before
[3:32:14] <%PaladinDupre> did you have a plan?
[3:32:15] <%Agami23> push the block o the side and just run out
[3:32:16] <AlmondRoll> pat is making the idol traps look WAY harder than they actually are
[3:32:17] <Simsandwich> Push the grey block first
[3:32:19] <fIashman92> zbombs
[3:32:20] <$fettsvett201> bomb
[3:32:23] <+Mmffgg147> you push the grey blocks that you know you can push
[3:32:27] <%cvp5127> not hayai enough
[3:32:30] <DazzlingFuhrer> the idol moving
[3:32:30] <%Agami23> moving the idol
[3:32:31] <%sleepers1mulant> moving the idol
[3:32:32] <+skm742> moving the idol
[3:32:33] <iamtheTwitchghost> the idol moving
[3:32:34] <OkamiDude15> picking up the item id guess
[3:32:34] <%ChocolateVGZ> taking the thing
[3:32:34] <AlmondRoll> The idol moving
[3:32:34] <Ids560> this one triggers when the idol moves
[3:32:35] <MKII> grabbing the idol
[3:32:35] <$Timesteel> picking up the idol
[3:32:35] <derekwst3> grabbing the gold thing
[3:32:36] <pitagor2> moving the idol
[3:32:37] <nepwar> idol being moved
[3:32:37] <Simsandwich> As soon as the idol moves
[3:32:38] <%chiazam> MOVING THE IDOL
[3:32:40] <cybz98> The idol being moved
[3:32:43] <Enthaarungscreme> the idol moving
[3:32:43] <nepwar> its like indiana jones
[3:32:44] <%ChocolateVGZ> yeah so if it gets moved cause of bomb
[3:32:49] <%ChocolateVGZ> or something
[3:32:50] <frostybee> oof LUL
[3:32:52] <%Agami23> except on a specific level. where its standing on a specific spot
[3:32:59] <%wydamn> some form of idol movement
[3:33:00] <%JD_Lars> Impure thoughts
[3:33:02] <%ChocolateVGZ> it's basically the block it's setting on, if it's just like the first one
[3:33:04] <dots4eyes> Smush the humbus outta him
[3:33:06] <%sleepers1mulant> smoosh baby, gain humbus
[3:33:07] <%DedlokPM> the idol being moved
[3:33:07] <Sapphire_Breeze> squish that dog
[3:33:08] <%GarbageNirvana> That dog is great
[3:33:08] <anAngryHamster> You seen Indiana Jones?
[3:33:10] <%ChocolateVGZ> sitting on*
[3:33:12] <silentblast93> getting the idol is hard
[3:33:14] <RickSaintRiot> in order to disable the trap, you need to rub your face dramatically and spill some sand on the ground
[3:33:15] <GhostAnimals> Happy Birthday Pat!
[3:33:19] <Enthaarungscreme> can you go to title and show stats?
[3:33:19] <AlmondRoll> well, GENERALLY it's idol movement, it can be something else in later levels
[3:33:22] <cursedcharley> First time catching stream in a while and got to see the baby getting smushes
[3:33:27] <%trustycoyote> I feel like Geif's face is like silly putty
[3:33:31] <%ChocolateVGZ> Kissy spider
[3:33:37] <Jrocy247> Pat is SURROUNDED by his animals right now
[3:33:41] <iamtheTwitchghost> woof
[3:33:44] <%AzureGale> Getting idols is easier in idolm@ster
[3:33:47] <peyodogo> you're getting a lot better, pat!
[3:33:48] <%Parapattern> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[3:33:55] <+Rofiarf> that was in game i thought?
[3:33:56] <RickSaintRiot> fun fact: a spider's bite is transmitted through its legs
[3:34:03] <%Mendin> That was the in-game-dog
[3:34:06] <%sleepers1mulant> was that in game
[3:34:06] <nepwar> geid wishes to be released from his cages
[3:34:09] <TheNumberJay42> why is his leash on
[3:34:10] <ShinNoisyCat> pat lose dog
[3:34:11] <%maenos2> the dog barked in game pat
[3:34:12] <%JD_Lars> That was game
[3:34:13] <ShinNoisyCat> now pat scream
[3:34:13] <RickSaintRiot> a spider's fangs are for show, and for picking up radio signals
[3:34:16] <silentblast93> mod the dog to look like zangeef
[3:34:17] <duckmeister7> fun fact: in the lore for this game, all the cavemen believe dubs are better than subs
[3:34:20] <thisisacoolguy> You're getting better Pat, you're almost to 1-2!
[3:34:30] <RickSaintRiot> interesting that the dog is in fact a consumable
[3:34:32] <ShinNoisyCat> nice dodge into
[3:34:34] <ShinNoisyCat> everything
[3:34:36] <%ChocolateVGZ> you can use the cat as a projectile
[3:34:42] <%ChocolateVGZ> if you're not a casual
[3:34:56] <silentblast93> and the cat to look like elomo
[3:34:57] <RickSaintRiot> he was running to give you the ruby
[3:34:59] <%Profmcstevie> An instant restart is too powerful for Pat, he'll never commit lsrToxic
[3:35:04] <RickSaintRiot> and you let him die
[3:35:10] <AlmondRoll> remember, your life is worth way more than the pet's life
[3:35:11] <ShinNoisyCat> you got this
[3:35:16] <%ChocolateVGZ> not instant enough can he hold the R button
[3:35:18] <Simsandwich> Need to accept those hits
[3:35:21] <%GarbageNirvana> I think from one tile up you can jump into spikes
[3:35:23] <iamtheTwitchghost> instant restart was a mistake for pat
[3:35:25] <thisisacoolguy> Hey pat, if it's a single tile you can lower yourself into spikes if you crawl off the ledge. Can also use a cape to float onto spikes peacefully @PatStaresAt
[3:35:26] <%GarbageNirvana> I THINK
[3:35:27] <ShinNoisyCat> got this
[3:35:30] <%PaladinDupre> pat you have to get to 2-1
[3:35:32] <RickSaintRiot> There's No Such Thing As A Perfect Run
[3:35:38] <ShinNoisyCat> oh
[3:35:38] <HailSeaser> commit coward
[3:35:39] <%ChocolateVGZ> instant restart is always worth it
[3:35:39] <ShinNoisyCat> what
[3:36:00] <%Profmcstevie> NO MISTAKES lytBADMAN , BUT MANY MISTAKE psaCanada
[3:36:01] <+aversal_ammar> We’re getting to 100 deaths at record speed
[3:36:04] <%ChocolateVGZ> on the first stage always reset if you get hit (unless you got a really good first stage layout)
[3:36:18] <iamtheTwitchghost> LUL
[3:36:24] <%ChocolateVGZ> throw the key as a weapon
[3:36:24] <cybz98> @PatStaresAt placing down ropes can also set off arrow traps
[3:36:27] <%ChocolateVGZ> and to trigger traps
[3:36:28] <ashbirds> this is the run
[3:36:32] <%ChocolateVGZ> lol
[3:36:33] <%MechArch> you can do it hayato, abuse bites za dusto's power
[3:36:33] <%sleepers1mulant> LUL
[3:36:36] <AlmondRoll> the game's long enough that instant restart on first zone damage is worth it, but pat isn't even getting getting past the first zone
[3:36:40] <%GarbageNirvana> Have confidence!
[3:36:43] <%ChocolateVGZ> arrows hurt ya'll
[3:36:47] <%GarbageNirvana> No confidence!
[3:36:48] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:36:50] <jware97> 76 deaths
[3:36:52] <silentblast93> oh pat you ccan throw the arrows
[3:36:56] <%Parapattern> Have humbus
[3:36:57] <TheNumberJay42> just git gud Kappa
[3:37:01] <RickSaintRiot> on the first stage, never reset. getting hit now actually increases your HP when you get to the next level
[3:37:04] <+RayDaug> I find it easier to hit bats facing away from them. The whip has a hit box behind you and the start up is faster
[3:37:04] <+Mmffgg147> No confidence ;_;
[3:37:05] <MKII> if you can't tell the podcast you made it to the next level that would be embarrassing!
[3:37:07] <Simsandwich> Slow your roll Pat, you have 3 mins
[3:37:10] <dots4eyes> Going for the Genocide run I see
[3:37:10] <%PaladinDupre> Spelunky is just Australia
[3:37:11] <penitentpentwitch> He needs... Calmfidence
[3:37:14] <duckmeister7> fun fact: all of the arrows in the arrow traps are blessed by the pope before they are placed
[3:37:21] <Simsandwich> 3 whole minutes is a long time
[3:37:23] <%ChocolateVGZ> Oh you guys are doing that thing I get it
[3:37:26] <+guyalex> @patstaresat if you haven't been told a bunch already, the backswing on your whip is often easier to hit bats with as it comes out faster
[3:37:28] <Mr_Strut> Have confidence, but also humbus
[3:37:28] <ShinNoisyCat> but how
[3:37:29] <+I_speel_my_dreenk> BAT TECH
[3:37:29] <OkamiDude15> pat is speed
[3:37:32] <%chiazam> HOW\
[3:37:34] <OkamiDude15> AH SICK
[3:37:34] <JanusII> "Have confidence. No confidence." - Inugami Korone
[3:37:38] <%ChocolateVGZ> A TERRIBLE CHILL
[3:37:40] <ShinNoisyCat> the meanest
[3:37:40] <Khorneflakes_> LUL
[3:37:42] <iamtheTwitchghost> HAHAHAHAHHA
[3:38:01] <+guyalex> lololol
[3:38:03] <%sleepers1mulant> fun fact: the spelunky ghost is the spirit of my dad
[3:38:03] <%DedlokPM> "Have confidence" *gets hit by arrow* "No confidence." @PatStaresAt
[3:38:08] <iamtheTwitchghost> LOL
[3:38:09] <%ClericOfSparda> psaPat psaGoblin psaPat psaGoblin psaPat psaGoblin
[3:38:10] <%ChocolateVGZ> damsels can tank a hit or two. Isn't their health like 3?
[3:38:14] <OkamiDude15> whens the update where too many instant restarts give a penalty Kappa
[3:38:16] <%chiazam> NO DONT RESTART THERE LMAO
[3:38:17] <+aversal_ammar> Man the guy keeping track of deaths is getting some work in
[3:38:23] <ShinNoisyCat> oh man, instant replay really is the worst for pat
[3:38:23] <+Mmffgg147> Use dog as a weapon - he doesn't take damage when he's hurting something else
[3:38:24] <duckmeister7> @sleepers1mulant that IS a fun fact
[3:38:24] <+TheSaintJohn> stop restarting lol
[3:38:24] <frostybee> If he keeps restarting as soon as he takes damage we are going to be here for a while LUL
[3:38:26] <RickSaintRiot> fun fact: all the pets you don't save actually feel real pain, and when they die in-game it hurts the entire time.
[3:38:26] <iamtheTwitchghost> sanity go down
[3:38:29] <%ChocolateVGZ> psaGoblin
[3:38:30] <+skm742> @Chocolatevgz 3 hp, yes

[3:41:16] <+TheSaintJohn> hit don't get hit

[3:43:28] <+TheSaintJohn> why
[3:43:35] <+PenmanLupine> are ya winning Pat?
[3:43:35] <iamtheTwitchghost> i think we would be if not for the instant restarts
[3:43:37] <dots4eyes> We need a death compilation
[3:43:40] <DazzlingFuhrer> that one was unnecessary
[3:43:46] <%Profmcstevie> Always assume spiders, always assume skeletons
[3:43:47] <jware97> 81 deaths
[3:43:49] <nepwar> @AlmondRoll understandable. have a nice day
[3:43:51] <HailSeaser> @aversal_ammar probably at 100 restarts
[3:43:53] <iamtheTwitchghost> @dots4eyes that's just the entire stream
[3:43:56] <+aversal_ammar> Damn if only you could have thrown the pot
[3:43:57] <%DakotaMacDoodle> You can do it Pat
[3:44:00] <%sleepers1mulant> @dots4eyes that would just be the stream vod lmao
[3:44:02] <DazzlingFuhrer> @dots4eyes Yeah the VOD is going up later.
[3:44:02] <ShinNoisyCat> straight to the punching machine with you
[3:44:04] <%ChocolateVGZ> WHY
[3:44:05] <%ChocolateVGZ> AAA
[3:44:05] <silentblast93> pat stops fucking restarting at 1 hit
[3:44:13] <silentblast93> 3 hearts are good
[3:44:13] <jware97> we are at 81 deaths
[3:44:18] <s1rcuit> at least the load times are short
[3:44:19] <+vampireacedia> this game EXUDES comedic timing energy
[3:44:22] <RickSaintRiot> urn-throwing mechanics? in THIS day and age? i'll believe it when i see it
[3:44:22] <ShinNoisyCat> YOU STILL HAVE 3 HP
[3:44:26] <%ChocolateVGZ> You can bomb traps sometimes
[3:44:28] <%OperatorJo_> left for a bit. has Pat gotten the second level yet?
[3:44:31] <dots4eyes> Ahahaha. I both love and hate this.
[3:44:31] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt shopkeeps don't care. a fly could sneeze in their shop and then they will hate you for all eternity.
[3:44:38] <anAngryHamster> Do the statistics count restarts as deaths?
[3:44:40] <nepwar> pat should never be trusted with a IRL quick restart
[3:44:42] <%cvp5127> a reset should count as a death
[3:44:44] <%ClericOfSparda> Are we counting instant restarts as deaths?
[3:44:49] <silentblast93> @PatStaresAt are the mind goblens fucking with you again pat?
[3:44:50] <+aversal_ammar> UNGA BUNGA MUST BE PERFECT NUMBER
[3:44:53] <%DedlokPM> @OperatorJo_ Define "second level" psaWhat
[3:44:54] <+TheSaintJohn> wombo
[3:44:56] <%ChocolateVGZ> This game has a second level?
[3:44:57] <ShinNoisyCat> are you sure you want to restart
[3:44:57] <jware97> I'm only counting on screen deaths
[3:45:02] <ShinNoisyCat> i think that could have been the one
[3:45:04] <iamtheTwitchghost> I TOLD CHAT TO NOT TELL YOU
[3:45:04] <ashbirds> it's our fault
[3:45:05] <jware97> restars would be BIG number
[3:45:08] <jware97> restarts*
[3:45:08] <Ids560> it has 2 in fact
[3:45:10] <%Ranryu692> I guess that's why it's off by default
[3:45:13] <@SoFarFetched> Chat you brought this upon yourselves on telling him Kappa
[3:45:17] <+Mmffgg147> @DedlokPM The shopkeeper wasn't even shooting at him. The Lizard attacked the keeper and pat was standing behind it
[3:45:28] <%OperatorJo_> psaGoblin
[3:45:29] <dots4eyes> New tech
[3:45:30] <nepwar> you should have known better chat
[3:45:40] <RickSaintRiot> incredible block physics, never seen anything like it
