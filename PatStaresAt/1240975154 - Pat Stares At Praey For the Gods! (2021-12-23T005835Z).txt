[0:20:58] <graemecrackers2> How's Paige?
[0:20:59] <%AHomeschoolDropout> What does AAA actually mean tho
[0:20:59] <%Ebonyglow> AA
[0:21:00] <%valriot> YAKUZA IS NOT AAA LUL
[0:21:00] <fairore> it does
[0:21:01] <akitanito> AA.5
[0:21:02] <MyNameIsRasus> Yakuza is AA
[0:21:03] <%AncelDeLambert> midware?
[0:21:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> David Paige would write a story and forget it halfway through, so they start a whole other one, with less details
[0:21:04] <+TheBitingIrish> I'd say Kiwami and 7 are?

[0:21:07] <chimeraxmachina> His tears are nurturing my gay soul
[0:21:10] <%MrPolarBearCub> How could the guy who made life is strange hate gay people
[0:21:12] <%Bailey__Gaming> AA
[0:21:12] <+gustavozxd> WHAT ABOUT THAT BREAD THOUGH
[0:21:14] <%Dementedpenguin> Triple A marketing.
[0:21:18] <%RigmaroleHM> Lost Judgement is already only $30
[0:21:19] <%JoshManVGH> Triple J games?
[0:21:19] <%Puhff> AA
[0:21:20] <MyNameIsRasus> GOOD AD
[0:21:20] <%BinaryFireball> man I want a suntori lemon
[0:21:22] <AngryPumpkin1995> Yakuza is AA done right
[0:21:23] <%valriot> Most of Yakuza budget goes to porn actresses
[0:21:23] <+Kyma1020> Like maybe Judgment
[0:21:25] <Solidus_113> the ones with the dubs could be Triple A
[0:21:27] <%MegadBlitz> they PAID for that bread
[0:21:31] <fairore> i mean cal of duty came out every year
[0:21:33] <SaltyAzteca> Yakuza LOOKS it, but does it FEEL it
[0:21:36] <penitentpendant> Equals more money saved?
[0:21:40] <%Puhff> YEAH BUT IT WORKS
[0:21:41] <SomeStrangeBroad> man that was a hardcore poop
[0:21:45] <%Puhff> LIFE IS ADS
[0:22:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> BIG Money!
[0:22:06] <%JoshManVGH> Man FUCK the Pizza Emote Game Awards bullshit lottery fuck!
[0:22:07] <+gustavozxd> I've been playing max payne 1 lately and that game seems like it was some money
[0:22:08] <+Havictos> @patstaresat I wish FF14 could get big money
[0:22:08] <non_returner> well, Yakuza devs don't really have to recreate many assets
[0:22:09] <akitanito> Sssshhh
[0:22:12] <Zeikier> pat be reasonab;le
[0:22:13] <%valriot> TLOU2 is shite
[0:22:13] <%notsoy> that shit came out the same year Y7, doom eternal and animal crossing
[0:22:15] <%BinaryFireball> there are plenty of movies that had big budget made big money and suck
[0:22:15] <%Bloomingzonda> The only good AAA game I've played this year is Forza but its just Forza
[0:22:17] <%MidnightBurst12> but money
[0:22:18] <fairore> @SomeStrangeBroad are you still on the toliet ?
[0:22:18] <@Ranryu692> Insomniac has proven that we can have both
[0:22:19] <BepBepAmShep> I'd love to see what the Yakuza Sega budget is compared to the amount they get from the ad rev.
[0:22:20] <%SharkMissile> Silence, Commie
[0:22:21] <+gustavozxd> but what if MONEY
[0:22:23] <+tempestzephyr> no, money only
[0:22:25] <%AHomeschoolDropout> There has yet to be a open world game as lively as Kamaroucho or any of the cities in the Yakuzies
[0:22:31] <tanarath> Or not abusing people to make the game? How about that?
[0:22:38] <%MrPolarBearCub> That’s it pats lost it
[0:22:42] <$Emperor_Machinus> an arf?
[0:22:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Gold leaf covered owful mess
[0:22:43] <+Kyma1020> I just want a good $40 game that works and is fun is that too much to ask?
[0:22:44] <Zeikier> it's those 3 sliders where you can only pick 2 and "Good Game" can't be clicked ever
[0:22:45] <+Mrbaconator> sometimes those videos are good
[0:22:48] <%EynoStiles> But pat, dont you know you can make more money with a flop.
[0:22:49] <+tempestzephyr> goldflake bullshit
[0:22:51] <faldin> fuckin nasty pizza for losers
[0:22:52] <MyNameIsRasus> It doesn't even have sushi on it, shit pizza
[0:22:54] <%AnthroMetal> Yakuza is just Shemue if Shenmue was good
[0:22:55] <%retrohazard> this reference is doing mental damage to me
[0:22:57] <$insaneintentionsyo> are ya winnin, son? I just went through blighttown for the first time.
[0:22:58] <akitanito> but it's proven that if something is more expensive, you derive more pleasure out of it
[0:23:00] <graemecrackers2> What if very thin crust
[0:23:04] <%notsoy> kamurocho remains the best open world ever created, yokohama is getting close tho
[0:23:10] <%JoshManVGH> Remember when Insomniac proved you could make shit without crunch and it basically git snubbed at the game awards?
[0:23:11] <@Ranryu692> lol 90 cents
[0:23:17] <SaltyAzteca> What if the thrust had gold shavings
[0:23:17] <+gustavozxd> yeah well, Night in the Woods has a whole minigame about THAT atpIzza
[0:23:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Give me the local greasy spoons slice
[0:23:19] <+tempestzephyr> I wanna shit gold tho
[0:23:20] <faldin> sometimes, things that are expensive, are worse
[0:23:22] <SaltyAzteca> crust
[0:23:22] <thesugardaddy111> because it is, the whole reason they only put gold leaf on it is to make it more expensive, and really no other reason
[0:23:25] <SaltyAzteca> fuckin autocorrect
[0:23:28] <+sermittens> Chicago deep dish is great
[0:23:31] <%Blank9> but what about pizza that's $20 with a vinaigrette on it and only 20% of surface area has any cheese
[0:23:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ive had that! Best pizza from just some guys store

[0:42:13] <$SGrim> A touch
[0:42:17] <%RigmaroleHM> It's kind of shot-for-shot
[0:42:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> a tad
[0:42:18] <+AlucardX60> No, It's on the shoulder
[0:42:18] <%Nobrev> I think you changed the mashing not the holding on
[0:42:18] <akitanito> maaaybe
[0:42:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @ssjklyco literally yes, it's been in development for a while
[0:42:21] <%Dakuu75> this is borderline a rip-off...
[0:42:21] <MyNameIsRasus> don't see what you mean this is a totally original project
[0:42:22] <+RobertWayneLewis98> no its the elbow
[0:42:25] <%RealThiele> like a raw super
[0:42:27] <+TheBitingIrish> So on the nose it might be a zit
[0:42:28] <+ProfessorMorrigan> @thatdudenamedlogan but mom this is sotc: eurojank edition :(
[0:42:29] <+RobertWayneLewis98> shoulder
[0:42:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> you'll go flying
[0:42:31] <%EynoStiles> Its pretty "can i copy your homework"
[0:42:34] <%BinaryFireball> you're aloy and its sotc
[0:42:38] <%dalmek> I hope when you finish a loud disembodied voice starts speaking to you
[0:42:49] <$SGrim> It's almost like an homage... a shade... a shadow.
[0:42:50] <%GIGA255> thighs of steel
[0:42:57] <Sotetsu> Are you enjoying this?
[0:42:58] <MyNameIsRasus> it's shadow of the colossus but without revived power
[0:42:59] <%chance_h> Can’t you just stand on shoulder?
[0:43:02] <Evitron1> i mean, if they wanna copy sotc's homework, by all means
[0:43:02] <+kewlmyc> You think we would have seen more Shadow of the Colossus style games, but this is the first one I'm seeing other than the original.
[0:43:04] <MyNameIsRasus> so it's worse by default
[0:43:06] <%codedoomboy> It’s asking for marriage at this point
[0:43:11] <%BinaryFireball> looool
[0:43:13] <%afronooch> LUL
[0:43:14] <+Aldra_E> Wtf, why not?
[0:43:14] <@Ranryu692> LUL
[0:43:16] <%valriot> LUL
[0:43:16] <Sotetsu> Dang
[0:43:16] <penitentpendant> Fair
[0:43:18] <+CommissarBudgie> it hurts more to be stepped near than to fall from like 10 stories
[0:43:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I really need to ask: who the hell looked at SotC and said "you know what this needs? Survival Crafting and Zelda."
[0:43:19] <Ranger747> LUL
[0:43:20] <%MidnightBurst12> oh noooo
[0:43:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's just a 1-1 rip off
[0:43:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> huh, still looks fun to me
[0:43:24] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't blame you
[0:43:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> but worse
[0:43:27] <+ProfessorMorrigan> oof.
[0:43:29] <odnucaf3> Is not as good as SotC?
[0:43:29] <akitanito> Over a year?!
[0:43:33] <%mai_waifu_> I thought this game looked cool until now
[0:43:41] <%Dakuu75> That's rough buddy
[0:43:46] <%FacetiousAF> @akitanito oh yeah it got announced awhile ago
[0:43:46] <SomeStrangeBroad> loks like god of war
[0:43:50] <%JoshManVGH> He has a gapple point on his ass it looks like
[0:43:50] <+TheBitingIrish> Spoil the disappointment
[0:43:52] <%AncelDeLambert> survival meters and a hookshot, just...
[0:43:52] <%NopeBadguy> that sucks
[0:43:53] <+RobertWayneLewis98> sotc seems pretty bland to me, unique, but bland gameplay.
[0:43:55] <MyNameIsRasus> more like bad-dow of the colossus
[0:43:59] <%EynoStiles> NotLikeThis
[0:43:59] <%valriot> Back to Nioh 2? LUL
[0:44:01] <%IronOhki> Is it legit doing nothing original from SotC?
[0:44:05] <%GIGA255> welp guess it's time to fire up endwalker instead then :D
[0:44:05] <%AncelDeLambert> you must be UNIQUE
[0:44:09] <ergulor> yeah improve or be original
[0:44:18] <MyNameIsRasus> @IronOhki it has a hookshot
[0:44:18] <%IronOhki> Cuz it sure looks like it's just SotC.
[0:44:19] <+ProfessorMorrigan> maybe the differences are yet to come? :D
[0:44:24] <%MonsterEnvy> Apparently it does get more unique after the start
[0:44:25] <%BinaryFireball> i mean its still early in the game.... so maaaaaybe they introduce new thing a little later on?
[0:44:26] <%CatastropheCorvid> So that's what that Hard Drive article was about.
[0:44:28] <%dalmek> you need a reason not to just go back to the original thing
[0:44:32] <nochejunior> maybe you get more tools..
[0:44:35] <%retrohazard> a reskin
[0:44:35] <%AncelDeLambert> like, this is a step back and to the left: open world indie shenanigans and no jump-stab, why live
[0:44:36] <%Kevlar_Caviar> for what it's worth, the later big boys are pretty different from the original colossi
[0:44:41] <%IronOhki> @IronOhki That was the first thing I saw when I jumped in and was hype. Then my hype went down from there.
[0:44:41] <%Dakuu75> literally indeed
[0:44:43] <%shootbang_exe> I played it  in early access and it was jank but fun
[0:44:47] <%smoothwood07> also, this choice for slaying this enemy doesn't make sense
[0:44:47] <sirrice77> well it does do something different which is the survival mechanics. This game was described as two different games mashed together
[0:44:52] <@commanderclaw> SotC but jankier and without the baller ass music
[0:44:55] <MyNameIsRasus> yo number 3 was so good
[0:44:59] <+pectusumbra> I mean it's got a grappling hook but it's hard to say as just a viewer
[0:44:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt Hard Drive article: "Blatant Rip-Off Described as ‘Love Letter’"
[0:45:00] <%cephalon_nyt> also, the music is nowhere near as good
[0:45:00] <Treasure_Vault> Hotswap to a different game
[0:45:00] <eustine> First boss, it might really open up. Then again I never played sotc
[0:45:02] <+ProfessorMorrigan> BONG
[0:45:03] <%mai_waifu_> The music is really boring ngl
[0:45:06] <SaltyAzteca> Oh cool SotC Snow edition
[0:45:07] <MyNameIsRasus> EVEN THE SLOWDOWN
[0:45:08] <%JoshManVGH> This seems like the SotC fight out of that one Castlevania game with Patrick Stewart and that guy from Stargate Universe.
[0:45:08] <nickynack_> no see but theres snow here. totally different
[0:45:10] <Solidus_113> SotC doesn't have grapple
[0:45:10] <%AncelDeLambert> also you need a full charge on the bell or it doesn't count, the sword let you do whatever damage you could squeeze in
[0:45:11] <%GIGA255> it's living in the shadow of the colossus?
[0:45:13] <+Fatmanjoggin> This is the Cool Ranch Dorito of Shadow of the Colossus
[0:45:14] <+kewlmyc> Even the sad death animation
[0:45:16] <MyNameIsRasus> OH COME ON EVEN THE SAD MUSIC
[0:45:17] <%IronOhki> @CatastropheCorvid Damn.
[0:45:19] <%EynoStiles> instead of a sword you get a grappling hook
[0:45:23] <+rafaelba93> just play nioh 2
[0:45:23] <$SGrim> Also, it doesn't seems as good. The atmosphere feels most flat.
[0:45:24] <%SharkMissile> Why sam gam
[0:45:28] <%walternatorz> was there any tension developed? they didn't really seem to drive home you could fail
[0:45:29] <%CatastropheCorvid> @CatastropheCorvid Right?
[0:45:30] <%smoothwood07> sooooo where's Aggro?
[0:45:30] <+ProfessorMorrigan> AngelThump
[0:45:31] <robobeau> is this game also going to have the exact same twist?
[0:45:32] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Watch em get sued for animation reuse
[0:45:32] <%TenraiDaze> abyss noodles gonna sprout?
[0:45:32] <SaltyAzteca> WHO IS THE NIMROD, I MEAN DORMIR
[0:45:33] <Lixagon> The same but Worse
[0:45:33] <akitanito> No argo no buy
[0:45:33] <%IronOhki> Now show me the bad curse sparkles going into you.
[0:45:33] <%dalmek> nono the tendrils will be light this time
[0:45:35] <@ssjklyco> that's the same animation
[0:45:36] <qaaj> wow i hope we're not the bad guys after all this
[0:45:41] <animaturgy> We truly were the SotC part 2
[0:45:41] <Evitron1> waynerWhite
[0:45:43] <%AncelDeLambert> did it explain how the bells work on these things?
[0:45:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Worm time, yea?
[0:45:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Black spew and sad music
[0:45:46] <%cephalon_nyt> I feel no connection to monster bro. oof
[0:45:50] <@ssjklyco> Shadow of the OC Do not steal
[0:45:50] <+bluguu> Not as cool without the blood
[0:45:52] <%Blank9> is it the same but with crafting
[0:45:54] <+TheBitingIrish> He rock now
[0:45:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Do you get gooped up with evil curse juice?
[0:45:57] <%dalmek> alright, being stuck as a statue is kinda neat I guess
[0:45:58] <%Dakuu75> is this actually just a Chinese knock off?
[0:45:58] <Evitron1> dog!
[0:45:58] <%JoshManVGH> Now does she absorb it?
[0:45:59] <Sotetsu> I never beat sotc. I guess it's a time to go back
[0:46:02] <nochejunior> this game is probably more fun for folks who don't know sotc
[0:46:03] <stote44> but it's got the halo grappling gun
[0:46:04] <%IronOhki> Hi Sif.
[0:46:05] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, random dog
[0:46:06] <MyNameIsRasus> SIF
[0:46:07] <+ProfessorMorrigan> agro (wolf edition)
[0:46:09] <%chance_h> But are you trying to resurrect you husbando?
[0:46:10] <+tempestzephyr> dog
[0:46:10] <SaltyAzteca> hey its that dog
[0:46:11] <%MonsterEnvy> Apparently it will change more as the game goes on, it's only super the same at the start
[0:46:12] <ammobasket> look it's horse 2
[0:46:13] <%RealThiele> fat dog
[0:46:14] <sonicblade38> wolf agro?
[0:46:14] <%IronOhki> Probably this.
[0:46:16] <MyNameIsRasus> IS SIF AGGRO?
[0:46:16] <%Nobrev> is that a Agro dog
[0:46:22] <%LouieRouie> But this game has a wolf
[0:46:23] <%SharkMissile> Pupper
[0:46:24] <%JoshManVGH> Gooby looking wolf
[0:46:24] <%BinaryFireball> its not a promising start
[0:46:26] <%Dakuu75> I THINK YOU'RE NOT BEING HARSH ENOUGH
[0:46:26] <%JokerNewby> So far seems like shadow without the emotional connection
[0:46:27] <%IronOhki> Did you dead?
[0:46:28] <%JoshManVGH> Wut...
[0:46:30] <%BinaryFireball> but it can get better
[0:46:31] <%Bluwizard21> Dogro
[0:46:32] <Sotetsu> It's okay to be harsh
[0:46:38] <soundcloud_raptor> hey
[0:46:39] <tanarath> No, it's slow & that isn't good.
[0:46:39] <$SGrim> Instead of Aggro its Arf-o
[0:46:40] <soundcloud_raptor> its that dog
[0:46:40] <%dalmek> Dogro
[0:46:42] <Solidus_113> 3 person dev team btw
[0:46:43] <@ssjklyco> it's not aggro
[0:46:43] <%dalmek> is strong
[0:46:45] <%FacetiousAF> "harsh but fair"
[0:46:47] <%cephalon_nyt> well, cute pupper instead of horse?
[0:46:48] <%RealThiele> dog: hey free food
[0:46:48] <%CalderGaming> I tune in and part is already dead and wolf food
[0:46:50] <ZE_Count> i wanted to see your head bump up every stair
[0:46:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what is with this direction?
[0:46:51] <%IronOhki> @Sotetsu We come to Pat for harsh.
[0:46:52] <Ranger747> no, you're pretty on point
[0:46:54] <%CatastropheCorvid> Good boy.
[0:46:55] <MyNameIsRasus> If a big evil voice starts speaking i swear to god
[0:46:58] <+SpinalWizard> "I am going to eat this"
[0:46:59] <%Dakuu75> thank's for the friction burns, ass-hole-dog
[0:47:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> why the shakey cam?
[0:47:09] <+Bael_Lord_of_End> Lawsuit incoming LUL
[0:47:13] <fairore> mmmmmm
[0:47:15] <%Agami23> fuck
[0:47:15] <%GIGA255> it just isn't the same without the rotting corpse of your girlfriend

[0:47:31] <%BinaryFireball> budget bb
[0:47:32] <nochejunior> with all that climbing, it was more like shadow of the calluses
[0:47:34] <StubbornDeer> oh my god

[0:47:35] <%Dakuu75> camera-man tried REEEEEALY hard back then

[0:47:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I was gonna say more Steam Greenlight feel
[0:47:53] <ammobasket> like people who make video game cameras but no film experience?
[0:47:58] <StubbornDeer> jump and run
[0:48:00] <%Dakuu75> JESUS
[0:48:00] <@ssjklyco> powered by ATI graphics

[0:48:21] <%smoothwood07> where are we going?
[0:48:28] <ZE_Count> I mean if your going to copy a game thats a good one

[0:48:30] <%Dakuu75> wtf is wrong with this camera?
[0:48:40] <%faintsmile> wonky angles
[0:48:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wait, that pool is where Baby Dormin turns into Ico!
[0:48:56] <akitanito> that subtle sway hurt my eyes for a bit
[0:48:57] <+Havictos> I know some of you guys are saying this good but this is nearly 1 to 1
[0:48:59] <%Dakuu75> this camera man is fucking drunk, dude
[0:48:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Dakuu75 Camera-man's tired, okay?
[0:49:02] <MyNameIsRasus> this is IN the nose
[0:49:04] <+RobertWayneLewis98> breath of the bla bla bla
[0:49:07] <%zarkazeon> so would you say this is a... shadow clone? :D
[0:49:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nice
[0:49:15] <MyNameIsRasus> ON GOD
[0:49:15] <%RigmaroleHM> What aspects did you like when you first heard about it?
[0:49:22] <Ranger747> oh
[0:49:23] <%RealThiele> oh nooo
[0:49:26] <%LouieRouie> Good job
[0:49:27] <GunneryGoblin> oh we zelda now i guess
[0:49:29] <$Jaxnos> suck it nerds it's actually zelda
[0:49:30] <%Nobrev> BREATH OF THE COLOSSUS
[0:49:31] <%Bloomingzonda> Why does this have the same art style as the XBLA game Bloodforge but look worse
[0:49:35] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Havictos But hookshot tho!
[0:49:39] <%Dakuu75> Let's just shove this Breath of the Wild mechanic into Shadow of the collusus XD
[0:49:41] <%FacetiousAF> shadow of the zelda Kappa
[0:49:43] <%sakeydo> How long before pat run away?
[0:49:46] <%IronOhki> Meanwhile in Skyrim.
[0:49:51] <%JoshManVGH> Aww yeah just what SotC needed, more Trickets
[0:49:51] <%cvp5127> remember zelda invented gliding
[0:49:59] <%FacetiousAF> now... tbf... Shadow of the Zelda sounds really cool tho...
[0:50:00] <@ssjklyco> it's menu is even early 2000s PC game
[0:50:02] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> unga
[0:50:06] <+Havictos> why the spin
[0:50:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> does that mean there's gonna be mobs?
[0:50:07] <%Kevlar_Caviar> you guys remember like, 6 years ago when beta footage of this was being passed around as a fake leak of sotc 2?
[0:50:14] <%BinaryFireball> loool that animation
[0:50:15] <%Dakuu75> yep, NO ONE did glidding before botw
[0:50:16] <%RealThiele> yea its got DS1 menu goin on
[0:50:17] <%Bailey__Gaming> Bonk Batton

[0:50:29] <+SunsetLaw> why does the music sound like the main menu music from DS3?
[0:50:30] <+kewlmyc> That animation is weird as fuck
[0:50:31] <%RigmaroleHM> LUL
[0:50:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> amazing
[0:50:33] <+RelikaNox> what blasphemy is that
[0:50:33] <%IronOhki> THAT LOOKS SUPER GOOD
[0:50:33] <jman13131313> this look like shit
[0:50:34] <%JoshManVGH> So does all this shit break?
[0:50:34] <%angryoptimist> Oh no
[0:50:35] <MyNameIsRasus> didn't SoTC have gliding as an unlockable?
[0:50:35] <ZE_Count> such skill!
[0:50:39] <%Dakuu75> was this made by one guy? (If it was, I can forgive everything)
[0:50:44] <%dalmek> oh good, normal enemies
[0:50:51] <%chance_h> Lol
[0:50:51] <%IronOhki> Is this game made by 1, 10, 100 or 1000 people?
[0:50:57] <%CatastropheCorvid> Someone get that girl a sweater
[0:50:59] <Evitron1> 3 people
[0:51:01] <%LouieRouie> Ocarina of Time had chicken gliding
[0:51:01] <%faintsmile> why did u attack her :(
[0:51:03] <%JoshManVGH> Wut

[0:51:04] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Dakuu75 iirc the dev team is 3 dudes
[0:51:04] <Solidus_113> 3 people
[0:51:06] <%Djinnazz> wtf is this?

[0:51:08] <eustine> bonk bonk
[0:51:11] <+kewlmyc> wasnt' expecting just regular non colossi enemies
[0:51:14] <%IronOhki> @CatastropheCorvid NO. She is too cool to be warm.
[0:51:17] <%CatastropheCorvid> She's just cold, Pat.
[0:51:18] <MyNameIsRasus> 3 people is impressive
[0:51:20] <%chance_h> Why lol
[0:51:21] <qaaj> is this the BOTW of SOTC games
[0:51:21] <+ArOne_Start> is this breath of the colossus or shadow of the wild?
[0:51:25] <%CatastropheCorvid> Why must you do this.

[0:54:09] <%RealThiele> ye i forgive a lot of the jank knowing such a small team made it
[0:54:18] <%angryoptimist> you don't take damage if you just hit the ground FASTER
[0:54:18] <Solidus_113> the point of interest button is usually what'll point to the direction of the next boss

[1:04:58] <+LittleCinders> I joined the stream only to see Pat closing the game lol
[1:04:58] <+TWoods_1993> I bought this on PSN and tried to get a Refund. It feels bad but I beat it because I paid for it. It’s like a 5-6/10 at best 😂
[1:05:03] <%Logoth_> lol, that was fast?
[1:05:04] <@Ranryu692> wait, he beat it?
[1:05:05] <akitanito> it's weird considering it got good ratings for some reason
[1:05:08] <%snugglepuggs> The urine helps switch games
[1:05:09] <%Cozy90> has anyone played the new World of Horror patch?
[1:05:13] <%EynoStiles> not game bad, just game jank?
[1:05:21] <+RobertWayneLewis98> I mean, ive never played sotc, if PftG is on Xbox id probably still give it a try
[1:05:24] <huskarl_zap> this is a product of a society
[1:05:27] <Clowns> @Ranryu692 gave up :D
[1:05:34] <%zeroarturia> Wow that bad huh?
[1:05:39] <%sakeydo> Ignorance  is bliss?
[1:05:39] <UchiVsTheWorld> what exactly made him stop
[1:05:40] <+bugz_munny> ngl that looked like a UE4 asset flip
[1:05:40] <Ahack13> wait, I wasnt paying attention. He finished it already?
[1:05:41] <MyNameIsRasus> we live in a society of the colossus
[1:05:43] <+TaylOctopus91> So maybe I'll take a longer look at it once it goes 60-70% off on sale?
[1:05:45] <+theoldone001> That animation is wrong. There is not that much hair on Pat's head.
[1:05:46] <%faintsmile> not great to say the least
[1:05:47] <%debugdrawray_> debugdrawray_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! christ 7 months till 3 years
[1:05:54] <SaltyAzteca> Shadows of the Jank?
[1:05:56] <+pectusumbra> @Cozy90 very briefly, realized I completely forgot how to play that game and died repeatedly
[1:06:07] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 ah. I thought I saw someone say it was super short and thought that he had beaten it while I was out of the room lol
[1:06:11] <MyNameIsRasus> Shadow of The Wild of The Elder Jank
[1:06:34] <+pectusumbra> @Cozy90 That said, I did see at least one of the new character unique events which was pretty cool
[1:06:45] <%Cozy90> @pectusumbra lol same. the new events are pretty cool.
[1:07:08] <%Cozy90> @pectusumbra oh cool. thats what i was wondering about
[1:07:17] <%CalderGaming> i walked away for 10 minutes, why the switch to nioh 2?
[1:07:18] <MyNameIsRasus> reload
[1:07:33] <sirrice77> @CalderGaming he really didn't like Praey at all
[1:07:42] <%CalderGaming> ah
[1:07:47] <peyodogo> @CalderGaming game bad question mark
[1:07:49] <+TWoods_1993> You can beat it in like 3/4 hours if you just do the bosses and all  the  other open world survival stuff feels tacked on to be a bit different from SotC
[1:08:00] <%Fefe41> Looks like I didn't miss much
[1:08:25] <%josstil> That was dissapointing :(
[1:08:43] <+polothegreatest> dang change so fast
[1:08:53] <arizenarkana> I knew the game was dead on arrival when Pat reached the second boss within 5 minutes of the first. Half the appeal of SotC is the journey.
[1:09:06] <%josstil> I was thinking about getting that  one
[1:09:18] <Josef_Stryker> Praey wasn't good?
[1:09:20] <+TWoods_1993> Looks nice for a 3 person team but it feels bad and the scope was too big
[1:09:22] <Profmcstevie> Lmao that was fast, the jank was too funky
[1:09:31] <%josstil> No
[1:09:48] <Profmcstevie> Ambition without talent is just overreaching your skillset
[1:10:01] <%josstil> Too ambitious
[1:10:10] <MyNameIsRasus> @TWoods_1993 yeah, if they make another smaller project i'm sure they'll do better
[1:10:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wild
[1:10:14] <@PrefectusCorgi> Oh MyGooooodddddd
[1:10:17] <+MajesticDoogle> was it bad
[1:10:17] <%W1nterTitan> Weird a 9pm start
[1:10:17] <%Blank9> yeahhhhh
[1:10:18] <%RigmaroleHM> LUL
[1:10:21] <sirrice77> Idk if it was without talent. It was made by 3 people. Maybe they should've just made something smaller
[1:10:22] <%Axellogic> I never thought id see the day you ran to play Nioh
[1:10:31] <+TWoods_1993> @arizenarkana the bosses do get further away but the world isn’t that interesting. Last 3 bosses are solid though
[1:10:31] <%Blank9> it's an onimusha intro
[1:10:34] <vandastelka> oh wow
[1:10:38] <@ssjklyco> This is the better clone
[1:10:39] <%zeroarturia> Like magic! psaLiz psaLiz
[1:10:40] <akitanito> goddamnit why would you break the ceiling like that
[1:10:47] <akitanito> you dun goof
[1:10:53] <MyNameIsRasus> praey will be a valuable learning  experience on ambition to the devs if they're smart
[1:10:53] <%baka_sugoi> A N I M E
[1:10:57] <huskarl_zap> the ripoff bro
[1:11:00] <%Blank9> freed from the mortal coil
[1:11:02] <%josstil> I would be interested  in a smaller project
[1:11:03] <%SharkMissile> This is so anime I lvoe it
[1:11:12] <SaltyAzteca> AAAANIMEEEEE
[1:11:15] <MyNameIsRasus> ANIME SHIT LESS GO
[1:11:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> cool
[1:11:22] <+French_Overlord> nioh 2 opening is great
[1:11:43] <Profmcstevie> ....oh yeah this game released this year, I forgot till steam awards nominations
[1:11:44] <eristhanewood> This game fucking rules!
[1:11:46] <MyNameIsRasus> time to slash some dudes
[1:11:46] <+bugz_munny> free me from this mortal coil daddy
[1:11:56] <SaltyAzteca> Nice, awakening is a good track
[1:12:08] <%Blank9> I like it more than just NOT doing a weapon like WoL in FF14
[1:12:12] <+McSoliace> and they do nothing
[1:12:15] <+TWoods_1993> It was in development for like 6 years too, I was real disappointed by Praey but I beat it because I’d already wasted the money 😂
[1:12:16] <%zeroarturia> Damn it I want to play nioh 2 now
[1:12:20] <%JohnAtDawn> Like 14
[1:12:23] <+Soliloquy123> FFXIV
[1:12:24] <+McSoliace> yeah it sucks
[1:12:26] <akitanito> you only get the grapple shot
[1:12:27] <%Nobrev> ff14
[1:12:30] <+bugz_munny> they like all run away
[1:12:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah
[1:12:36] <Astrophizz> like Mass Effect, no biotics or tech
[1:12:37] <+Havictos> @patstaresat talking about the Kai Leng fight?
[1:12:39] <BlindGato> all you need is the clawshot anyways
[1:12:43] <GunneryGoblin> Code Vein did it ok by making you vaguely swing around whatever weapon you're holding
[1:12:45] <HeroToxiko> i never got over the bioware cutscene red kunai
[1:12:48] <akitanito> Mass effect is just pistols lol
[1:12:49] <thequiteshallow> max payne 3 wasnt that great but it was like the only game where main chracter had and used the weapon u were currently using
[1:12:54] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> just shoot rocks n shit
[1:12:54] <%WutangchickeN> they should take away all the weapons and you should just fist fight the monsters
[1:12:55] <+Toblo1> @PatStaresAt Funnily enough, Code Vein was one of the few games that averted that. You actually swung your weapon more than a few times in cutscenes.
[1:13:03] <thequiteshallow> in cutscenes
[1:13:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> At least is not like boderlands 3 where your character dont exist on cutscenes
[1:13:07] <+MajesticDoogle> i was just playing stormblood and there's a scene where your character does a bunch of action shit like just off camera its really funny
[1:13:10] <SaltyAzteca> Yeah for the locks
[1:13:11] <+MajesticDoogle> it shows the last frame
[1:13:12] <%SharkMissile> Yeah you get skill points for all this training
[1:13:17] <sirrice77> Always do way of the whatever stuff
[1:13:17] <+rafaelba93> its fast
[1:13:18] <%Blank9> yeah, novice will unlock moves
[1:13:21] <+McSoliace> free points
[1:13:24] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt if only every hunter had some form of tool they could use in cutscene to get around that limitation. Like some kind of craving knife.
[1:13:24] <%MisterRockett> Oh wow was Pat not liking Pray THAT much?
[1:13:27] <thequiteshallow> I DOIN FINE
[1:13:30] <Zebroneath> Max Payne 2 did cool shit like that
[1:13:30] <scrumbotime> yeah trainings give you skills and Locks are just free skill points
[1:13:33] <SaltyAzteca> Ahhh english dub...ahhh
[1:13:33] <Zebroneath> 3*
[1:13:34] <%snugglepuggs> That’s why the end of EW is shocking
[1:13:37] <%Saadi90> Shy! <3
[1:13:44] <+Ell1ot> i like it when you do something cool but it looks weird because you don't have the intended weapon equipped
[1:13:44] <+Toblo1> @GunneryGoblin Most of the weapon types worked with whatever "swing" motion they had for the cutscenes at least. Or at least made it funny if you were doing it with guns.
[1:13:44] <+bugz_munny> yep
[1:13:46] <shiny_prinny> yeah pretty much
[1:13:47] <+MajesticDoogle> yes
[1:13:51] <IntrepidEye> Hey Shy.
[1:13:59] <%Blank9> a lot is pretty similar but improved
[1:14:07] <Profmcstevie> nioh 2 is nioh 1 we're sorry edition Kappa
[1:14:12] <%Fefe41> Wow look at this bald ginger weeb doing a bleach cosplay
[1:14:21] <huskarl_zap> no it's way more convoluted
[1:14:22] <shiny_prinny> high stance

[1:14:35] <%greasypete00> did praey not work? i missed it
[1:14:47] <akitanito> nice
[1:14:50] <huskarl_zap> breath sword
[1:14:52] <SaltyAzteca> RIGHT, PROPA JOB
[1:14:52] <%Axellogic> Sword of Meditation is so deceptively amazing, YOu cant get interruptted at all during it and if you let the full walk go its unblockable
[1:14:54] <%MyshkaMysh> \o/
[1:14:55] <%Blank9> every weapon is fantastic
[1:15:00] <@PrefectusCorgi> yes
[1:15:02] <sirrice77> @greasypete00 No he just thought it was bad
[1:15:03] <shiny_prinny> exactly
[1:15:05] <huskarl_zap> EYY BOOOY
[1:15:07] <+TWoods_1993> @greasypete00 Nah it’s just junk and not very good
[1:15:15] <Zebroneath> QoL is so good in this game
[1:15:15] <%epide> so i went back to play this today and i got farther then before and WOW this just keeps getting better
[1:15:18] <+Toblo1> @greasypete00 Nah, Pat just wasn't a fan.
[1:15:18] <akitanito> you have unlocked the essence of remembering to switch your moves
[1:15:28] <%snugglepuggs> Gosetsu??
[1:15:28] <MyNameIsRasus> punchy moves from a punchy gang!
[1:15:36] <+bugz_munny> Emma The Gentle One shit
[1:15:37] <SaltyAzteca> GALATICA PHANTOM
[1:15:40] <+McSoliace> thats a launcher
[1:15:41] <Zombrocom> Limitless is just a falcon punch
[1:15:42] <+bugz_munny> hell yeah
[1:15:49] <Zombrocom> Real good if you sneak up on em
[1:15:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh hey it's the ff14 stomp
[1:15:53] <%abrupt_abe> Not surprisingly later dojo missions can be super tough
[1:15:58] <%Blank9> stomp and battering ram are some of the absolute best
[1:16:09] <akitanito> Grappling!
[1:16:22] <+MajesticDoogle> @snugglepuggs well... it won't be  now lol
[1:16:23] <+bugz_munny> Thats just a god hand move
[1:16:25] <+bugz_munny> come on
[1:16:27] <Zombrocom> Battering ram is the BEST
[1:16:30] <sirrice77> battering ram is great
[1:16:31] <+sunny_side_up> battering ram absolutely dumpsters humanoids
[1:16:36] <lostcolors> fists are easily the coolest
[1:16:39] <SaltyAzteca> I always go Galactica Phantom with fists LUL
[1:16:42] <Profmcstevie> Okay but put more Godhand moves in games
[1:16:46] <%abrupt_abe> Battering ram equals quick grapple that doesn't allow as much stam regen on the enemy
[1:16:50] <Zombrocom> Battering ram is the human enemy destroyer
[1:16:52] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> Dempsey roll later on in high stance
[1:17:01] <SinisterBroccoli> the staff is pretty damn cool too
[1:17:07] <+Toblo1> Dodge Ki Pulsing is fucking *Great* in that Bloodborne-ass way.
[1:17:37] <%dalmek> if there's a skill you're gunning for, you can mark it with R3 so you remember for later
[1:17:42] <%Akizea> lol i see we're to nioh now
[1:18:00] <%EynoStiles> Can you commit to one weapon in this game
[1:18:04] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat sounding like the old foreign dude from Yakuza 0
[1:18:08] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt skills with a gold arrow over them can be leveled again
[1:18:11] <%Blank9> charging bull
[1:18:11] <%Akizea> @EynoStiles absolutely
[1:18:12] <SinisterBroccoli> retrograde is cool
[1:18:14] <sirrice77> @EynoStiles Yes, easily
[1:18:21] <%abrupt_abe> Odachi just wants it's 3 hit combo big slash move
[1:18:30] <%MyshkaMysh> Warrior stuff is cool but Onmyodo is where its at!
[1:18:33] <campasino> odachi is too easy
[1:18:37] <Zombrocom> Yeah moonlit snow is the shit
[1:18:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt What are you playing this on? I have trouble getting my ps5 controller to stay connected on steam
[1:18:49] <Josef_Stryker> My Odachi build just needed nothing but Moonlit Snow Redux
[1:18:51] <%Blank9> moonlit snow is so fancy
[1:18:52] <%Blank9> I love it
[1:18:53] <%Akizea> i did switchglaive for my first playthrough and man, magic opens up some nutty shit
[1:19:01] <%valriot> Moonlit Redux literally carries the entire game
[1:19:02] <%abrupt_abe> @zombrocom It feels so good clearing a room with it
[1:19:13] <SaltyAzteca> Oof, the first wall of Nioh 2
[1:19:30] <%Blank9> spear's low stance dodge jump is really neat too
[1:19:43] <+Toblo1> I kinda like having it more mission structured.
[1:19:49] <Profmcstevie> These are levels not worlds, yes
[1:19:52] <Zombrocom> Yeah, nioh has better combat, souls has better world/levels. That's just kinda how it is.
[1:19:53] <+pectusumbra> that's fair but it's a different beast
[1:19:53] <cthulewd> why is pupper so mad?
[1:20:06] <%valriot> Thats fair, this is more arcade/Diablo-like but with good combat
[1:20:07] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> i had a much better time on this boss than enenra
[1:20:08] <+sunny_side_up> odachi + fist is such a comfy setup
[1:20:11] <MyNameIsRasus> i mean it's an interesting distinction at least
[1:20:23] <%Akizea> pretty much
[1:20:24] <%Djinnazz> yes
[1:20:25] <odnucaf3> yes
[1:20:28] <sirrice77> Yes
[1:20:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah
[1:20:29] <%SharkMissile> ...yeah
[1:20:29] <SaltyAzteca> Yes
[1:20:29] <defaultname3887> lear to run it
[1:20:30] <%valriot> No you can get good
[1:20:30] <+critikal_bit> Yes
[1:20:32] <odnucaf3> sadly yes
[1:20:33] <+pectusumbra> Can you not save and quit in a level?
[1:20:34] <Profmcstevie> Like Megaman, you either win or you don't for that stage
[1:20:34] <+bravofifeniner> No you go to the last shrine you found
[1:20:35] <SaltyAzteca> You have to commit
[1:20:35] <shiny_prinny> when you quit out, it saves at your last shrine
[1:20:36] <+rafaelba93> you start at last shrine i think?
[1:20:36] <%epide> FROM LAST CHECK POINT YES
[1:20:37] <+Toblo1> Basically, but there are ways to "safely" back out
[1:20:37] <Josef_Stryker> Unfortunately
[1:20:37] <%Blank9> that or save/quit and keep it up, maybe grind in stage
[1:20:40] <lostcolors> yeah but levels are pretty short
[1:20:41] <defaultname3887> all levels in t -60 sec
[1:20:46] <Josef_Stryker> Fists/Claws are the shit
[1:20:49] <odnucaf3> all the shortcuts get closed again
[1:20:57] <%Akizea> fists are SO good
[1:20:57] <+TopTieramisu> this is a cool stage
[1:21:03] <%Akizea> like easily my favorite weapon in the game
[1:21:05] <%Axellogic> I mean the level would give you gear high enough to fight the boss so theorhetically it wouldnt be a problem, and if you just want to take a break you spawn at shrines
[1:21:06] <akitanito> oof
[1:21:10] <%Tragosavich> I think there are awards for finishing levels really fast right?
[1:21:14] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> GUN
[1:21:17] <%Akizea> splitstaff is also REALLY good too
[1:21:17] <StubbornDeer> ahhhh no more room in hell my favorite game for the n64
[1:21:22] <senfood> Thanks to Tim Rogers and Pat, I've started using the word "owned" again.
[1:21:26] <StubbornDeer> I see you've chosen Ryu
[1:21:26] <%epide> but most bosses are not to far from the last one or a short cut is opened that gives easy acess to the boss
[1:21:28] <StubbornDeer> as your main
[1:21:31] <b_ikki> there are awards for like everything
[1:21:48] <%SharkMissile> Again??
[1:21:50] <+cool_dev> Nioh is such a good game, it made me kick a hole in my bedroom wall
[1:21:52] <StubbornDeer> no it wants pizza
[1:21:55] <akitanito> poo stream
[1:21:57] <%Deft_Thought> psaDogchamp
[1:21:59] <StubbornDeer> all dogs bark because they want pizza and no other reaosn
[1:21:59] <SomeStrangeBroad> big dump
[1:22:00] <+theoldone001> Dogs do have to poo out of bottom sometimes
[1:22:01] <+00ichi00> Dam gotta go ice seen to much already lol looks great gotta finish the first game hope I’m almost done lol
[1:22:01] <sirrice77> is zangief made of poop?
[1:22:01] <+metaboss> are fists & staff a good combo? or are fists & odachi better
[1:22:02] <%Blank9> you can pause
[1:22:06] <+pectusumbra> don't forget to spam your tools and tiger runs for ninja points
[1:22:13] <%Tragosavich> I remember in Nioh 1 there were challenges to beat the level in like 90 Seconds
[1:22:18] <%RigmaroleHM> Who doesnt always want pizza
[1:22:20] <%Cozy90> we all want pizza
[1:22:32] <%cephalon_nyt> mmm, pizza
[1:22:42] <%Blank9> the only maybe bad combo for fists is tonfa, dual swords, or dual hatchets
[1:22:43] <SaltyAzteca> man a slice would be nice....fuuck im hungry now LUL
[1:23:07] <+zenraider> pizza is round, pizza is orb!!
[1:23:43] <Zombrocom> My first playthrough I ran a strength/magic build with fists switchglaive and splitstaff. Great fun. Those are some fun ass weapons.
[1:24:49] <%Bluwizard21> Hey guys when in character creation (which I'm making a new character now) is male voice 2 literally the link voice actor?
[1:25:29] <akitanito> that's a very fast poo
[1:25:34] <+CommissarBudgie> Why did he have to pee?
[1:25:42] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> shame about praey for gods. guess ill play the gundam game with cute girls.
[1:25:45] <%baka_sugoi> PEE BER GONE
[1:25:47] <%CalderGaming> psaDogchamp psa1guy
[1:25:59] <+bugz_munny> Man this is really making me want to finish up this game
[1:26:01] <%Blank9> @Bluwizard21 they legit have the link va as an npc, so probably
[1:26:21] <%Blank9> it's just free throw if they have like, half ki
[1:26:21] <%abrupt_abe> Odachi good crowd weapon, very fun
[1:26:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that finisher is a lot more vicious with claws
[1:26:29] <Zombrocom> We told ya about that battering ram
[1:26:39] <akitanito> yo
[1:26:51] <+bugz_munny> DAYUM
[1:26:55] <+bugz_munny> get rekt
[1:26:56] <Skeleton_Sama> Hey pat have you thought about playing serious sam 4?
[1:26:57] <%garbageheaphound> Jesus
[1:26:57] <+sunny_side_up> ninja bullshit LUL
[1:27:02] <Josef_Stryker> I love the fists so much
[1:27:04] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So praey to the gods was a bust huh?
[1:27:10] <akitanito> dynamite no jutsu
[1:27:12] <%Broand> This guy is a bomb thrower build
[1:27:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid unfortunately
[1:27:28] <%Broand> hey so long as it works
[1:27:32] <+bugz_munny> Like this just needs the god hand soundtrack overlayed and id be fine with it
[1:27:47] <Josef_Stryker> I forget but does the game have an auto equip button or anything where you can just put on the best recommended gear?
[1:28:06] <%Blank9> don't think so, but you can organize by highest level and just slap that on
[1:28:08] <%Broand> you wish
[1:28:10] <Josef_Stryker> I love the Odachi grapple so much
[1:28:11] <%Blank9> and it won't lead you too wrong
[1:28:19] <@Ranryu692> no
[1:28:19] <+HellCopter> Best gear means different things to different people
[1:28:20] <huskarl_zap> Dussy rekt
[1:28:22] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> that tap is great
[1:28:28] <digitaldenam> Fuckin bodied
[1:28:37] <%Axellogic> You hit enemy until it die
[1:28:39] <+dougrayman> the best weapon class in the game is the switchblade
[1:28:50] <@PrefectusCorgi> Not Really
[1:28:55] <digitaldenam> Failed yokai men
[1:29:05] <Zombrocom> That is what happens when you OD on amrita
[1:29:06] <%Tragosavich> @dougrayman But fists are cool
[1:29:21] <RubberFistFight> Yay I haven't missed "angry pat yell at samurai monster man"

[1:29:25] <+Havictos> Can some explain what the crystals are?
[1:29:26] <pectusumbra> maybe those crystals ain't all that
[1:29:38] <bugz_munny> Amrita?
[1:29:43] <ForneusAtSeaWorld> rocket fist
[1:29:44] <bugz_munny> isnt that the gold stuff?
[1:29:47] <akitanito> close
[1:29:50] <Havictos> yeah those
[1:29:51] <Blank9> crystals are magic pretty much
[1:29:55] <Tragosavich> Oh god I hated those enemies in Nioh 1
[1:30:02] <Zombrocom> It's basically crystallized magic yeah
[1:30:04] <SaltyAzteca> GET USED TO SAYIN THAT A LOT LUL
[1:30:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> monke
[1:30:14] <Havictos> so just solid magick energy?
[1:30:25] <bugz_munny> FREED
[1:30:26] <Monkeyweed21> thas wuh happen when you dont have a guardian spirit and use spirit stones
[1:30:28] <huskarl_zap> just wait until the crow men
[1:30:29] <+dougrayman> you dodging too early
[1:30:35] <%Glass_Muffin> lets gooo nioh 2
[1:30:40] <SaltyAzteca> Yep
[1:30:44] <Profmcstevie> A dodge of panic not confidence
[1:30:51] <%AncelDeLambert> that's very nice sir, but you just killed me by stomping on my face, so I don't know why the sword was so importatn to you
[1:30:56] <+pectusumbra> you could last night as well when it woke up in particular
[1:31:03] <%Glass_Muffin> i loved the odachi
[1:31:12] <+dougrayman> @PatStaresAt the higher your yokai level, you start understanding more yokai
[1:31:15] <SaltyAzteca> Meant for crowd control. BUT FUCK THAT HUGE KATANA
[1:31:38] <%Blank9> crowd control but also big chops
[1:31:44] <RubberFistFight> So which spirit/yokai shift is he using? Feral, Brute or the other one I can't remember.
[1:31:55] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[1:31:59] <%Blank9> brute
[1:32:15] <DragonOfWarZro> 3rd is phantom
[1:32:18] <+theoldone001> As much as I love Nioh, the lack of a good cohesive level design really ruins it for me.
[1:32:26] <%MyshkaMysh> Remembering to do the Yokai counter was my biggest issue with this game.
[1:32:27] <%Blank9> you can buy ammo at the blacksmith
[1:32:30] <%baka_sugoi> PAAAT
[1:32:31] <akitanito> how did he not die from that
[1:32:35] <%Tragosavich> I love the odachi combos going from one stance to another is so fun
[1:32:39] <%Deft_Thought> psaGiefrail
[1:32:46] <SaltyAzteca> ZANGIEF IS LEARNING
[1:32:46] <ToneBacas> monkaS
[1:32:46] <RubberFistFight> @Blank9 Oh. He'd probably have a better time with Feral since it has a wider counter window and the forward dodge can get you away/through shit fast.
[1:32:49] <+bugz_munny> OH SHIt
[1:32:49] <akitanito> WHAT
[1:32:53] <KeiPrime> using yokai counter to cancel attacks is big easy and fun
[1:32:54] <%washicka> HE'S GOT A KNIFE
[1:32:54] <+TheBitingIrish> EXCUSE ME?
[1:32:54] <SaltyAzteca> NEXT HE'LL DO TAXES
[1:32:55] <@Ranryu692> seems to be a theme
[1:32:56] <%cvp5127> blade gief
[1:32:58] <%Bluwizard21> Zangeif Sword Dog
[1:32:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> Soon he'll be opening boxes!
[1:32:59] <%RigmaroleHM> He is become SIF
[1:33:00] <%PMAvers> He knows you are full of loot.
[1:33:00] <TallYoda08> monkaS He's too smart.....
[1:33:01] <Tracazoid> Shoulda named him Sif
[1:33:03] <%valriot> psaDogchamp Perish, humans
[1:33:03] <Profmcstevie> Or he has many boxes to open
[1:33:04] <%Deft_Thought> psaDogchamp Soon I will put you both to rest
[1:33:04] <akitanito> redneck sif
[1:33:05] <+thickshield> the dog studies the blade...
[1:33:06] <+TopTieramisu> pat's not ready for the missiles
[1:33:06] <scrumbotime> he isn't PLANNING, he's just going to goofily bumble into your murders
[1:33:09] <%baka_sugoi> One day he will have GUN
[1:33:10] <%octavian_wolf> that's real" That monkey has a gun" energy
[1:33:12] <%RealThiele> whats that? a knife "NOOOOO"
[1:33:18] <+TheBitingIrish> He just wants to assist with Boxing Day :)
[1:33:21] <%epide> dogo supremacy
[1:33:24] <+bugz_munny> You're gonna wake up this morning to READ MY ATTACKS, PAT
[1:33:25] <Explodincatz> hes planning to get a job at the grocery store
[1:33:28] <+TopTieramisu> these guys aren't monkeys
[1:33:31] <ToneBacas> @RealThiele i know that video LUL
[1:33:41] <%baka_sugoi> He wants the insurance
[1:33:44] <%abrupt_abe> I love that the directions of your swings can actually matter
[1:34:02] <Profmcstevie> What if Zangief merely wants to spar with you and make you stronger
[1:34:05] <RubberFistFight> man i love getting matchlocks or bows with extra headshot damage on them - making their heads just explode or fly off is great.
[1:34:10] <%sakeydo> Zang-sif!
[1:34:20] <PooferLlama> KonCha hows nioh 2 going?
[1:34:26] <+bugz_munny> guns in this game feel suprisingly great
[1:34:29] <DragonOfWarZro> Zangief is become kageroumaru
[1:34:29] <+bugz_munny> its kinda weird
[1:34:47] <%Tragosavich> Any plans going back to Nioh 1 just to see how it compares to Nioh 2?
[1:35:03] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:35:21] <Mr_Rakjo> M O N K E
[1:35:26] <DragonOfWarZro> No, pat is a part skipper
[1:35:28] <GilliamYaeger> DECAPTIATIOOOOOOOOOON
[1:35:46] <+TopTieramisu> pat doesn't care about jonathan joestar
[1:35:52] <PooferLlama> fists/odachi is quite the powerful combination
[1:35:53] <%kulmoth> monkaS
[1:35:55] <%Blank9> going to nioh 2 instead of nioh 1 is like megaman x instead of megaman 1
[1:35:57] <%watchmanfury> are you liking this game better than the first one?
[1:35:57] <President_valentine> this is a case where it's ok to do that
[1:35:58] <Mr_Rakjo> soo, goblin defeated?
[1:36:01] <akitanito> goblin super defeated
[1:36:03] <+bugz_munny> BUT THE LORE
[1:36:04] <%SharkMissile> There is no Nioh 1
[1:36:06] <Zebroneath> disgusting, but brave
[1:36:10] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe he has done this thing that he has done
[1:36:11] <Profmcstevie> Megaman 2 over Megaman 1 yeaaaahhh
[1:36:15] <Bustahhwulf> pat crimson
[1:36:20] <DragonOfWarZro> Who the hell is dio?
[1:36:21] <+TopTieramisu> no one needs to play mega man 1
[1:36:23] <+Havictos> I mean I like William but not more than I like Nioh 2
[1:36:26] <huskarl_zap> this says alot about our post industrial society
[1:36:26] <%Deft_Thought> I figured I could stay up an watch the stream but I'm beat.
[1:36:33] <T_Sasquatch> Bruh
[1:36:39] <akitanito> is X 10 times better than?
[1:36:42] <+wmeldrum> I skipped parts because I don't hate myself. We are not the same.
[1:36:45] <+polothegreatest> nah man, MMX is better than original DarkMode
[1:36:49] <%Deft_Thought> Thanks for streaming, Pat. Hope it's a fun stream.
[1:36:55] <Profmcstevie> Megaman 2 is like an apology game, many of the elements from the first but done....not crap
[1:37:03] <Zombrocom> I mean, nioh 1 is a good game
[1:37:04] <+TopTieramisu> mmx is pretty different imo
[1:37:06] <GilliamYaeger> God, fists are so good
[1:37:12] <Zombrocom> It's just... nioh 2 is just a better version
[1:37:12] <+pectusumbra> yo, purple switchglave
[1:37:22] <%AgniBrandt> MMX is so much better than normal MegaMan
[1:37:26] <+TopTieramisu> nioh 1 is fine but it's way rougher than 2
[1:37:28] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> skill points pat
[1:37:30] <%DianaTheAscian> I played Mega Man 1 and remember doing yellow devil legit
[1:37:41] <%angryoptimist> Megaman 1 was worth playing.  That's about all I can say for it.
[1:37:41] <%CalderGaming> hitotsume, i bet his name is
[1:37:53] <+TopTieramisu> counterpoint, the later mega man games are still good while x games get worse
[1:37:53] <Josef_Stryker> BTW does Pat know about Purification?
[1:38:01] <Zombrocom> It's just called "One-Eyed Oni" actually
[1:38:05] <lol_red_ranger> how do i defeat airman he has SIX tornadoes
[1:38:05] <%valriot> Did Pat equip the Ippon Datara soul core?
[1:38:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> AND his core
[1:38:12] <%SharkMissile> That's a good one
[1:38:12] <SaltyAzteca> GOTTA COLLECT THEM ALL
[1:38:17] <%DianaTheAscian> Mega Man 1 is a fun time capsule
[1:38:19] <%AgniBrandt> @TopTieramisu But are the later Megaman games better than the good MMX games?
[1:38:23] <+SilverDevilfish> Rare Thong
[1:38:24] <+pectusumbra> and a loincloth
[1:38:31] <%Dakuu75> oh look, a real game

[1:39:02] <%Tragosavich> I use money for cosmetics to transmog?
[1:39:07] <%Blank9> you can buy ammo at blacksmith too
[1:39:07] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt money is for blacksmith shit, soulmatching, forging, etc.
[1:39:11] <Josef_Stryker> Has Pat tried out his Yokai abilties?

[1:40:44] <RubberFistFight> Wait til you see what Scampuss does in the yokai realm
[1:40:47] <RubberFistFight> it's fucking great
[1:40:51] <RubberFistFight> sorry, the Dark Realm

[1:41:47] <JetpackMcQuack> this goblin weaksauce
[1:41:53] <SaltyAzteca> yo Thats a fuckin praise
[1:41:56] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt nah that's the dark realm. the yokai realm is when they pee themselves and try to pretend it's a "corrupted ki puddle".
[1:42:00] <%AgniBrandt> Oh fuck it is kinda God Hand isn't it
[1:42:00] <Josef_Stryker> Fists/Claws are the shit

[1:42:43] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat oh Pat you have no idea,You have only begun to scratch the surface of fists in Nioh 2, look up Beyond Infinity
[1:42:47] <%angryoptimist> Are those light antlers or magnum eybrows?
[1:42:53] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i don't think it does either. just trying to provide counterpoints to x being clearly superior to the original series. i personally like the z series the most
[1:42:59] <%Dakuu75> Man, these Yoki are pretty... YOKED~
[1:43:02] <%Blank9> demolished
[1:43:03] <%Tragosavich> Damn that hammer smack was clean

[1:43:08] <%AgniBrandt> @DXLelouch24 That skill is SO FUCKING SATISFYING
[1:43:11] <RubberFistFight> I love how the yokai that generates the dark realm has spiderlilies popping out of the ground around them
[1:43:11] <GilliamYaeger> Ippon Datara is so fucking sick
[1:43:12] <defaultname3887> i would love if he would some of your guides, thanks to them i understood some yokai skills
[1:43:18] <+TopTieramisu> hardly 🤔
[1:43:25] <+Fatmanjoggin> bigly

[1:43:50] <SaltyAzteca> As you go up stairs, look to your left @PatStaresAt
[1:43:53] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt there's a slope up there, if you follow that spot around to the right, it goes under the building supports.
[1:44:01] <%AgniBrandt> @RubberFistFight Holy shit I got to NG+++ and never noticed that

[1:44:15] <defaultname3887> pooferlama is a nioh 2 semi expert @pooferllama
[1:44:21] <%valriot> Use Ippon Datara, trust
[1:44:28] <%Dakuu75> Don't talk about guides in this chat. Guides are banned, m'kay
[1:44:29] <b_ikki> one eyed oni gives insane devil trigger gauge
[1:44:34] <didgereedoodah> oh snap it's poofer
[1:44:37] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight Hahahah. I noticed it immediately. It's essentially the big flag that says "killing this guy cleanses the area".
[1:44:38] <ToneBacas> it means more goblins

[1:44:41] <Profmcstevie> Cosmic wisdom
[1:44:44] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt You've unlocked higher tiers in the shiftling skill tree
[1:44:46] <RubberFistFight> So when you enter a dark realm, keep an eye out for it.
[1:44:49] <%Blank9> you got enough souls to do more skills in shiftling
[1:44:51] <shiny_prinny> new shifling skills can be learned basically
[1:44:57] <%PMAvers> I think it opened up new stuff on the Shiftling sphere grid
[1:44:57] <%weissguard> weissguard subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! Have a good stream.
[1:44:58] <%Axellogic> oh Pro Tip Pat, some yokai skills transform your body completely like Ippon or One Eyed Oni, When transformed grabs dont work on you
[1:45:03] <DragonOfWarZro> Your eyes have begun to open
[1:45:05] <GilliamYaeger> It means you've done enough Yokai shit to get a Shiftling skill point
[1:45:06] <defaultname3887> @pooferllama the insane guides over the style tournament from discord
[1:45:14] <%Dakuu75> I feel like Pat's crazy is infecting me right now...
[1:45:18] <+TopTieramisu> yoki bear
[1:45:20] <huskarl_zap> one eued oni is a phallus reference
[1:45:21] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt that meant you could learn shiftling skills. Some active, some passive.
[1:45:33] <%FacetiousAF> we talkin about eggs
[1:45:35] <PooferLlama> @defaultname3887 interesting...i did judge the style tournament, ya know Kappa

[1:46:00] <President_valentine> Ippon is great
[1:46:06] <%Blank9> ippon's a nice solid knockdown
[1:46:07] <zerointelligence000> I wonder if yoki is as great as GOUGI
[1:46:09] <shiny_prinny> if one-eyed oni had the slam attack it would be a much better soul core
[1:46:12] <RubberFistFight> Hey pat when are you getting the Hoser soul core Kappa

[1:46:46] <PooferLlama> @defaultname3887 lol its fine, im just busting your chops LUL
[1:46:54] <SaltyAzteca> He'll be back for ninja LUL
[1:46:55] <%Blank9> free bombz
[1:47:03] <GilliamYaeger> FRACTURE FOE YEAH
[1:47:06] <%Agami23> ninja has some good stuff. like shurikens being better rocks
[1:47:08] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt actually ninja tree is super useful. I think there's a skill buried in there that increases your elixer carries, and i know it can increase your ammo as well.
[1:47:08] <Zombrocom> Limitless is a bit gimmicky but it's also fun as hell
[1:47:10] <%Monkeyweed21> LIMITLESS
[1:47:23] <PooferLlama> BEYOND INFINITY
[1:47:34] <+gfb537> Strongly advise you look into catwalk and the stealth skill in ninja (forget name of invisability in ninja, but it's right next to catwalk).
[1:47:40] <%Broand> Shurikens can do some good KI damage for some reason
[1:47:40] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Stealth run from the Ninja tree is REALLY good.
[1:47:46] <+bravofifeniner> The kicks are good for building ki
[1:47:48] <SaltyAzteca> THATS THE GALACTICA PHANTOM BABY
[1:47:51] <%Dakuu75> Mmmmm~ look at that delicious-delicious Sphere Grid guys~
[1:47:56] <President_valentine> Galataca Phatom
[1:48:08] <RubberFistFight> honestly the onmyo and ninja trees are massively useful, i feel the game kinda buries the lede on that a little bit.,
[1:48:10] <%Dakuu75> love me, a good sphere grid
[1:48:12] <defaultname3887> i will one day master beyond infinity's timing
[1:48:13] <Josef_Stryker> GALACTICA PHANTOM
[1:48:13] <+gfb537> Exactly.  Stealth skills in ninja very good for death runs when learning bosses.
[1:48:14] <SaltyAzteca> IT DOES THE BIG DAMAGE
[1:48:19] <+NiktenKing> VERY BIG PUNCH
[1:48:19] <+TopTieramisu> it basically is galactica phantom
[1:48:27] <%PMAvers> Zangief: "Oh hello, would you like to see my knife now?"
[1:48:27] <RubberFistFight> like holy shit, the stuff you get that can put on your weapons, and the -stop talismans
[1:48:29] <RubberFistFight> so great
[1:48:30] <%Blank9> limitless is better than sneak attack sometimes
[1:48:31] <defaultname3887> for now i can only get the first part semi consistently
[1:48:36] <%Dakuu75> LOL~!!!!!!!!!! gief.,

[1:50:45] <SaltyAzteca> yeeeeep
[1:50:49] <+bravofifeniner> They stack
[1:50:50] <%abrupt_abe> Regen on counter is good
[1:50:51] <shiny_prinny> for this tree yeah
[1:50:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they add up very nicely
[1:50:59] <odnucaf3> Nioh2 > Sekiro
[1:51:00] <defaultname3887> mostly passives in the samurai and yokai trees
[1:51:03] <%Blank9> yeah, just grab what applies most often
[1:51:07] <%Axellogic> healing when picking up soul cores or burst countering can save your life
[1:51:09] <AngryAsian5> BORK
[1:51:11] <ToneBacas> is Gief watching the game?
[1:51:13] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yeah. There's a lot on the branch over to the right in shiftling that are quite helpful though.
[1:51:14] <rReizs> they modify a selected active skill
[1:51:31] <+horsesaredumb> I wanna give doggy a hug BibleThump
[1:51:34] <Hasemeow> baby mode
[1:51:40] <DragonOfWarZro> Nioh 2 > soulsborne
[1:51:51] <Zombrocom> Not fists
[1:51:51] <PooferLlama> bare handed = no weapons
[1:51:53] <%Axellogic> no weapon
[1:51:54] <+bravofifeniner> Right, no weapons
[1:51:54] <shiny_prinny> yes no weapons
[1:51:54] <PooferLlama> does not apply to fists
[1:51:55] <+horsesaredumb> no weapon
[1:51:56] <%valriot> no weapons
[1:51:56] <%abrupt_abe> No weapons
[1:51:56] <President_valentine> No weapons
[1:51:57] <%Blank9> no weapons at all
[1:51:57] <GilliamYaeger> Not Fists
[1:51:57] <BepBepAmShep> It means no weapon
[1:51:57] <RubberFistFight> barehanded
[1:51:57] <+TopTieramisu> no weapons
[1:51:57] <SaltyAzteca> bare handed = no weapons
[1:51:58] <stormhawk9891> No weapons
[1:51:58] <sirrice77> No weapons
[1:52:00] <%watchmanfury> its incredibly unclear
[1:52:01] <Zombrocom> No weapons at all
[1:52:01] <DragonOfWarZro> None
[1:52:05] <%Axellogic> It helps you kill with emotes though
[1:52:06] <%Visorak6> thats for gimmick runs
[1:52:06] <KeiPrime> no weapon
[1:52:10] <scrumbotime> literally no weapons, that was how you had to do punching before fists came out
[1:52:13] <rReizs> back at launch barehanded was BUSTED
[1:52:14] <%Blank9> also green orbs like that bottom one are modifiers you equip per-skill, generally not great early on
[1:52:19] <klx5> those skills existed pre fists, it was their janky way of letting you play unarmed if you really wanted to
[1:52:19] <RubberFistFight> So basically if you decide you wanna throw down with a yokai in maquis of queensberry rules
[1:52:25] <lostcolors> fist weapons were added later iirc
[1:52:27] <%epide> i think you can buff your bare fists thou
[1:52:28] <%bevyrage> it does work on attacks where you hit with your knee, foot, or elbow too though
[1:52:32] <%notsoy> gief big and pig
[1:52:38] <tmvct1> game good?
[1:52:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Flux 2 can give infinite ki with practice
[1:52:43] <+TopTieramisu> bare fist has no style or drip though
[1:52:52] <%Agami23> square to see what skills it increases
[1:52:53] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Skills with a green border can be equipped on to moves to augment them
[1:52:55] <Zombrocom> Those green arcana skills can only go on one skill per weapon by the way
[1:53:05] <%SharkMissile> Yea :C
[1:53:20] <%Agami23> no because my dogs are very strong and blockhead-ey
[1:53:33] <+horsesaredumb> wow what a beautiful dog
[1:53:40] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt my advice would be angle for the talismans you can apply to your weapons first.
[1:53:43] <stormhawk9891> Purity is good
[1:53:45] <defaultname3887> branch out
[1:53:45] <RubberFistFight> You WILL need them.
[1:53:46] <%Agami23> probably grab purity
[1:53:46] <%valriot> Different
[1:53:46] <+theoldone001> Gief stream only when??
[1:53:48] <$SGrim> More this
[1:53:49] <lol_red_ranger> learn the scampus tecnique
[1:53:50] <shiny_prinny> different thing for versatility?
[1:53:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Barrier is the best one in the game
[1:53:54] <%Blank9> purity good
[1:53:55] <defaultname3887> you want acces to variety
[1:53:58] <%Axellogic> I reccomend learning barrier talisman eventually
[1:53:58] <DragonOfWarZro> Water and Lightning
[1:54:04] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> purity
[1:54:05] <%AgniBrandt> Personally I love lightning
[1:54:22] <shiny_prinny> note that purity debuff goes away if corruption debuff is applied
[1:54:22] <%epide> honestly the leach life might not be bad for you as well
[1:54:23] <%valriot> Purity wont stack with Corruption, but Purity is flat out better
[1:54:26] <%Axellogic> Barrier Talisman doubles your ki recovery
[1:54:27] <SaltyAzteca> Practice your Naruto running
[1:54:34] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt YOu have separate capacities for Onmyo and Ninjutsu
[1:54:35] <SomeStrangeBroad> maybe if we are lucky gief will beat off again
[1:54:38] <RubberFistFight> yeah purity and corruption are mutually exclusive
[1:54:38] <President_valentine> Purification and Corruption override each other if you try to inflict them both
[1:54:38] <%Blank9> fire = dot, lightning = slow debuff, water = defense debuff
[1:54:40] <%Dakuu75> ♪♪ It's the EYE of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight~! ♪♪
[1:54:44] <Zombrocom> You got limitless and purity talismans
[1:54:48] <%Agami23> and it comes back when you rest, and you get exp for using the spell so go for it
[1:54:53] <RubberFistFight> purity = extra ki damage to yokai, corruption = the same, but for humans.
[1:55:00] <%Blank9> high stance guarding square
[1:55:18] <%SharkMissile> AWOOOO
[1:55:18] <%FacetiousAF> ruh roh
[1:55:19] <DragonOfWarZro> Fire is hot garbage
[1:55:21] <SaltyAzteca> OH THERE HE GOES
[1:55:23] <+RelikaNox> Oh dear
[1:55:30] <huskarl_zap> AMOGUS
[1:55:32] <SomeStrangeBroad> hes totally jerking off
[1:55:33] <GilliamYaeger> Lightning's the best element imo
[1:55:35] <+WildcardM> oh no zangief ate elmo
[1:55:38] <Profmcstevie> No box cutters for you Zangief
[1:55:40] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:55:41] <GilliamYaeger> That slow debuff is SERIOUS
[1:55:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Limitless is best used on enemies getting back up
[1:55:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:55:49] <RubberFistFight> Oh also Pat, mid-stance has a better dodge and more iframes. I wound up paying hard for leaning too much on high stance once I passed the midpoint of the game. Low stance is basically only good for applying debuffs quickly.
[1:55:53] <%DianaTheAscian> Geif did a big bad
[1:55:54] <%watchmanfury> Thats the Nioh two step, spend 15 minutes buying cool moves and then forget them all and used all your old combos psaLiz
[1:56:00] <%ElkRiverDog> psaBig psaDogchamp
[1:56:08] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat Paige's Walker?
[1:56:11] <+SunsetLaw> Zangief Stares At: Pat's angry face
[1:56:11] <%retrohazard> a tale as old as time
[1:56:17] <DragonOfWarZro> Lightning for new players water for pros
[1:56:24] <President_valentine> hit his arm
[1:56:28] <RubberFistFight> Water is super useful
[1:56:34] <RubberFistFight> also holy shit poison is so goddamn overpowered
[1:56:50] <SaltyAzteca> TENGU-SAMA
[1:56:54] <%Visorak6> REMEMBER ME?
[1:56:54] <+Mrbaconator> it is GO TIME
[1:56:55] <President_valentine> Tengus are a bitch
[1:56:56] <%Dakuu75> Tengu-Man
[1:56:57] <+Mrbaconator> BIRD UP
[1:56:57] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt before you accept a mission at the bottom of it's info screen it says how many kodamas are in it
[1:56:57] <%SharkMissile> Borb :v
[1:56:58] <mike2hands> KURASU TENGU
[1:56:59] <+pectusumbra> that's a tengu alright
[1:56:59] <%Blank9> this fucking bird
[1:57:00] <+HellCopter> These guys feel even harder
[1:57:03] <rReizs> man fuck raven tengus
[1:57:03] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt the prayer bench tells you how many there are in an area, under "Receive Blessing". Also make sure you're checking your blessing periodically, it falls off between regions.
[1:57:08] <IntrepidEye> Ah Tengu. My second most hated enemy
[1:57:17] <rReizs> no weak point having bitch ass
[1:57:26] <DragonOfWarZro> No wind debuff tho
[1:57:31] <KeiPrime> shuriken clip these guys's wings
[1:57:31] <%Saadi90> I think I got killed my this thing the most
[1:57:35] <%Blank9> oh yeah you get onmyo proficiency just for hitting while a buff's on
[1:57:36] <SaltyAzteca> NIIIIIICE
[1:57:38] <KeiPrime> or is it the othe rguy who flies
[1:57:40] <%valriot> Use yokai skills, theyre stronger and charge faster in these dark realms
[1:57:45] <RubberFistFight> @DragonOfWarZro omg the wind thing in 1 is the worst.
[1:57:54] <KeiPrime> man i love this game
[1:57:59] <%watchmanfury> @valriot REALLY?
[1:58:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> EZ
[1:58:01] <DragonOfWarZro> Ikr
[1:58:04] <SaltyAzteca> First try, good shit man
[1:58:05] <+pectusumbra> I'm sorry, Weathered bone and bleached blade?
[1:58:05] <Zombrocom> Getting multiple status effects on an enemy at once procs an extra status effect that weakens them even more
[1:58:07] <%Saadi90> Good job!
[1:58:11] <%patriotrenegade> whoops
[1:58:20] <SaltyAzteca> yes he is, not a pushover
[1:58:22] <+theoldone001> Then they put like 3 of them together in later leves next to Sneks
[1:58:30] <Zombrocom> Well, he can be tough for a regular enemy
[1:58:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> farm some of these revenants
[1:58:33] <GilliamYaeger> He can be a real bastard if you get cocky
[1:58:41] <%Axellogic> being able to burst counter them makes them easier than in 1 though
[1:58:42] <%DianaTheAscian> Reggie luck has blessed Pat
[1:58:45] <didgereedoodah> just a stronger than average enemy
[1:58:47] <GilliamYaeger> Because he's a regular enemy, not a boss
[1:58:48] <KeiPrime> can blindside  a lot of players
[1:59:12] <RubberFistFight> There are areas that basically feel like every single encounter is a mini-boss
[1:59:12] <%RealThiele> but can you defeat evillak
[1:59:17] <RubberFistFight> it gets tiresome, honestly.
[1:59:19] <Zombrocom> Tengu core is actually kinda good because it lets you fly above things
[1:59:44] <%watchmanfury> @RubberFistFight the youkai hunter's house level is exhausting
[1:59:44] <+Mrbaconator> gief sounds like a monster in this game
[1:59:44] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:59:50] <+HellCopter> Love it when that happens
[1:59:52] <SaltyAzteca> YES
[1:59:52] <+TopTieramisu> if nioh 2 wasn't a mission based game and was more like a souls game in its overworld, it'd be perfect
[1:59:52] <Mr_Rakjo> All of them
[1:59:52] <RubberFistFight> You'll get a lot of them
[1:59:56] <@PrefectusCorgi> All of them
[1:59:59] <+HellCopter> The place is lousy with tsuchigumos
[2:00:03] <Josef_Stryker> ALL of the Tsuchigumos
[2:00:05] <%Blank9> basically no weapon's unique, you can always get more
[2:00:16] <%angryoptimist> How many does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
[2:00:20] <SaltyAzteca> I love this music its so good
[2:00:29] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt if you ever got one with a REALLY good set of affixes, and don't want to part with it, you can use a higher-level item and "soul match" to it, so it raises the level on your good/preferred one.
[2:00:57] <+Pars_Librum> Pat not having a secondary ranged weapon is setting me off. No rifle for headshots make me sad.
[2:01:02] <lol_red_ranger> number go up
[2:01:08] <$ImExtremelyManly> fat
[2:01:13] <KeiPrime> more item more number, simple as
[2:01:16] <SaltyAzteca> He will get a rifle
[2:01:17] <%SharkMissile> Guns are super good in this
[2:01:24] <President_valentine> you'll get it eventually
[2:01:24] <RubberFistFight> I picked up a katana that had a beast amount of purity on it, plus like 24% ki reduction on attacks in midstance and a bunch of other baller shit
[2:01:27] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt It's fine; rifles appear a bit later and hand cannons later still
[2:01:33] <GilliamYaeger> You get rifle as part of the plot
[2:01:37] <%epide> bows are far more common
[2:01:39] <%Axellogic> Pats just starting dudes chill
[2:01:39] <+rafaelba93> snake time?
[2:01:40] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Steel yourself. This is the first wall of Nioh 2
[2:01:41] <%Blank9> it's crazy how much better ranged weapons feel in nioh than souls
[2:01:42] <Bustahhwulf> why doesnt pat have end game gear BabyRage
[2:01:47] <$ImExtremelyManly> youll get it later
[2:01:49] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> there are also cannons you can carry around.
[2:01:50] <+Pars_Librum> Honestly, I forgot when you get rifles in this so that one was my bad
[2:01:53] <RubberFistFight> @Pars_Librum eh it's still early days, it took me a little while before i got a secondary worth using too.
[2:02:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I always find revenants first thing when I go into a mission to get pre farmed stuff
[2:02:09] <RubberFistFight> TOKICHIROOOOOO
[2:02:15] <SaltyAzteca> bri'ish
[2:02:16] <DragonOfWarZro> I cant wait for pat to try ta get a yasakani in DotS
[2:02:18] <huskarl_zap> oi oi cunt
[2:02:28] <%SharkMissile> Oh fuck me this is the snake
[2:02:31] <huskarl_zap> WAIT
[2:02:32] <$ImExtremelyManly> ya the years will go by in this game
[2:02:36] <+Pars_Librum> @RubberFistFight Yeah, it had been quite a bit since I played Nioh 2 so I totally forgot when you even got the first one
[2:02:36] <RubberFistFight> Fun fact: The dude they got to voice him in Japanese (and the guy he's modelled after) has played a version of this character no less than 4 times.
[2:02:37] <huskarl_zap> Is that
[2:02:38] <%Axellogic> @SaltyAzteca What was your playstyle, legit curious because this boss is so polarizing in difficulty he's either super easy or ungodly hard for people
[2:02:44] <%watchmanfury> that's the guy they'll get for Cid in FF7 remake 2
[2:02:51] <RubberFistFight> KO-DAMMER
[2:02:51] <%angryoptimist> "ey wat you git-dono"
[2:02:56] <%Monkeyweed21> you need to save that guy that kinda looks like shimano
[2:03:16] <+Havictos> do you live longer as a Half demon?
[2:03:29] <studleydoorite> gunpowder shit and plot
[2:03:30] <soflicar> guard walk helps sneak up
[2:03:30] <%garbageheaphound> Man those claws look wild as fuck
[2:03:39] <TheeRabbi> My only complaint about this game, visually, is that your dude starts to look like he's wearing a bunch of gaudy, mismatched MOBA skins over time.
[2:03:40] <$ImExtremelyManly> the new weapons for this game is such a good addition
[2:03:52] <%watchmanfury> @soflicar Quite the opposite in fact!
[2:03:59] <%YakumoYomi> バニング！
[2:03:59] <SaltyAzteca> @Axellogic I used odachi with fists. The problem wasnt just the boss, but the area too. Took me a solid 2 hours to beat it
[2:04:38] <+Pars_Librum> I loved the fist weapons moveset
[2:04:45] <GilliamYaeger> @TheeRabbi Only if you don't use refashioning at the blacksmith to make yourself look good.
[2:05:14] <SaltyAzteca> @GilliamYaeger was it you that gave me the tips with Disco Elysium?
[2:05:26] <GilliamYaeger> I think so
[2:05:27] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:05:28] <studleydoorite> he hit you
[2:05:28] <RubberFistFight> @TheeRabbi only if you're bad at gearing
[2:05:30] <GilliamYaeger> How'd that work out?
[2:05:34] <RubberFistFight> the entire gear system is based around sets
[2:05:34] <DragonOfWarZro> This boss is actually incredibly hard for new players
[2:05:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:05:38] <RubberFistFight> even more so than the first game.
[2:05:40] <President_valentine> there's holes there
[2:05:43] <%Tragosavich> least you didnt fall to your death
[2:05:58] <Josef_Stryker> Any reason Pat is playing with English voices?
[2:06:04] <RubberFistFight> @DragonOfWarZro i can't remember which boss is coming up... which one is it?
[2:06:10] <TheeRabbi> Yeah but having to use a game feature to make my character not look like a strobe lit 4 year old who dressed himself is kinda lame.
[2:06:12] <%Tragosavich> LOL
[2:06:12] <ToneBacas> LUL
[2:06:12] <AngryAsian5> LUL

[2:06:25] <@Ranryu692> @DragonOfWarZro just wait and see
[2:06:26] <Thepothero> csbeastSetIn
[2:06:28] <TheeRabbi> fell to death
[2:06:29] <DragonOfWarZro> The dunkey video one
[2:06:37] <+kevlarkoala> @Josef_Stryker because you're watching and reading everything on stream is stupid
[2:06:43] <SaltyAzteca> At least he beat the oni so that path is clear of evil
[2:06:51] <%RealThiele> yahoo hoo hoooey
[2:07:11] <T_Sasquatch> I truly don't understand the intended playstyle of Nioh 2. I just bullshit my way through
[2:07:14] <RubberFistFight> you will get so fucking sick of those gakis
[2:07:17] <RubberFistFight> i swear to christ
[2:07:21] <%Samuy_JP> this dub is the gift that keeps on giving
[2:07:27] <RubberFistFight> they're worse than the dwellers from the first game
[2:07:30] <DragonOfWarZro> Half of my summons were to this mission
[2:07:37] <%Blank9> the intended playstyle is bullshit your way through using one of 500 ways to do it
[2:07:45] <President_valentine> I don't think there really is an intended playstyle for this game
[2:07:55] <%Blank9> when everything's broken, everything is broken
[2:08:32] <T_Sasquatch> @president_valentine i mean like compared to sekiro or bloodborne that have clear intended playstyles
[2:08:35] <rReizs> it will be once you use it for a bit
[2:08:36] <+TopTieramisu> yeah. this game has so many systems and mechanics, you can find your own way of winning
[2:08:39] <didgereedoodah> it was higher level so yes
[2:08:47] <studleydoorite> would this be a good game to introduce my grandma to gaming
[2:08:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> still no gun
[2:08:50] <DragonOfWarZro> Spam your Stand abilities
[2:08:59] <Josef_Stryker> OM NOM NOM
[2:09:06] <TheeRabbi> It's closer to the Ninja Gaiden style of empowering you and challenging on that level rather than the Dark Souls way of making you a clumsy little bitch and forcing you to grind to be slightly less of a bitch. I prefer the Nio 2 route.
[2:09:07] <%RealThiele> beeg baby
[2:09:09] <ToneBacas> that's a big boi
[2:09:21] <President_valentine> @t_sasquatch Just go wild with whatever you find fun
[2:09:27] <GilliamYaeger> @PatStaresAt Don't forget to hold forward when you ki pulse to attack with it
[2:09:47] <ToneBacas> so is level design and enemy placement more interesting in this, compared to Nion 1?
[2:09:47] <%Dakuu75> drift?
[2:09:56] <TheeRabbi> Uh oh, dog is pooping everywhere
[2:09:57] <studleydoorite> monkaS
[2:09:57] <%Dakuu75> UH OH
[2:09:59] <+TopTieramisu> @ToneBacas i'd say yes
[2:10:00] <ammobasket> 0.0
[2:10:01] <%Dakuu75> aww...
[2:10:03] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:10:04] <studleydoorite> phew close one boys
[2:10:15] <SaltyAzteca> Soldier doesnt see Pat LUL
[2:10:28] <RubberFistFight> @TheeRabbi Dark Souls is "git gud". Nioh is "you're not gud and you never will be, now pick yourself up and hit this fucking monster in the face."
[2:10:30] <%LtSurge> psaBlind
[2:10:32] <%Blank9> try out limitless sometime, see how much damage it does
[2:10:35] <didgereedoodah> don't forget you can pause
[2:10:36] <%Fefe41> he was standing so unbelievably still that he was invisible to the monster
[2:10:40] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:10:41] <Josef_Stryker> BTW Pat u can pause this game
[2:10:45] <+TopTieramisu> unlucky
[2:10:50] <studleydoorite> turns out if would've sped things up if he saw
[2:11:02] <RubberFistFight> Quietly Kappa
[2:11:03] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt just walk
[2:11:04] <%notsoy> i think he did pause at least once during last stream lol
[2:11:04] <+TopTieramisu> have you tried walking?
[2:11:07] <%Axellogic> walk and stay out of their face
[2:11:09] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> walk
[2:11:10] <+Inferno_Icon> walk up
[2:11:11] <+AntithesisEK> walk slowly
[2:11:11] <+pectusumbra> someone said guard walk for now
[2:11:11] <shiny_prinny> walk up slowly, some people just have wide vision cones
[2:11:15] <%Tragosavich> basically walk up guarded is what I do
[2:11:16] <+BlackSunEmperor> wear light armor, walk slowly
[2:11:20] <%Monkeyweed21> approach slowly from behind
[2:11:22] <defaultname3887> easiest is block+walk
[2:11:23] <%Axellogic> YOu can hold block it forces you to walk
[2:11:24] <DragonOfWarZro> Sneak better
[2:11:26] <defaultname3887> and light armor
[2:11:30] <Kghaleon> Later in the game if you pump all your stats into DEX, the Ninjutsu feathers destroy bosses in seconds...lol
[2:11:37] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> guard while walking helps
[2:11:38] <SaltyAzteca> @GilliamYaeger Dude it worked out great so far. I have been playing DE for hours non stop its so good its consuming me help NotLikeThis
[2:11:39] <Josef_Stryker> Nioh 2 in English is so weird.
[2:11:44] <%Double_Tap_That> That voice reminds me of a certain cat boy
[2:11:47] <Josef_Stryker> It's almost like Battle Construction Vehicles
[2:12:03] <RubberFistFight> Oh remember to check your prestige titles periodically as well, you get points you can spend on some useful passives, like extra health or faster ki regen and stuff @PatStaresAt
[2:12:08] <%Tragosavich> Theres also a ninjutsu scroll that makes you super quiet
[2:12:15] <shiny_prinny> if you get Catwalking scrolls in ninja tree you can use them to run silently
[2:12:15] <ToneBacas> isn't there a shinobi skill tree or something?
[2:12:26] <ToneBacas> woah
[2:12:27] <AngryAsian5> DAMN
[2:12:37] <SaltyAzteca> yeaaaa

[2:12:49] <DragonOfWarZro> Outplayed
[2:12:51] <TheeRabbi> He did give you a break, technically.
[2:12:53] <SaltyAzteca> They use desperation attacks when theyre low on health
[2:13:15] <studleydoorite> that guy just stood there while you shot his friend to death
[2:13:18] <+TopTieramisu> the desperation attack can be countered
[2:13:48] <RubberFistFight> @TopTieramisu red ones yes, white ones now
[2:13:52] <RubberFistFight> no*
[2:13:55] <%Blank9> limitless from behind might be more damage than sneak attack
[2:13:59] <%RealThiele> bow was better ambush dmg
[2:14:22] <%Tragosavich> I like cannons, they go boom
[2:14:23] <+pectusumbra> Worth
[2:14:31] <+TopTieramisu> i love how this guy didn't notice his buddy getting beheaded in front of him
[2:14:31] <$ImExtremelyManly> oh nice
[2:14:31] <SaltyAzteca> GALACTICA PHANTOM
[2:14:44] <%Vextalyst> Iron fist attack
[2:15:28] <RubberFistFight> that seems overpowered
[2:15:30] <%Tragosavich> Jesus, almost one shotted
[2:15:30] <+TopTieramisu> it's a great move
[2:15:33] <+pectusumbra> that's so good. And it's a riot to imagine it
[2:15:41] <Kghaleon> It's really good until you miss
[2:15:44] <+pectusumbra> just sneaking around and pile bunkering people
[2:15:51] <%Blank9> it's super good on downed or stationary enemies
[2:15:55] <GilliamYaeger> @RubberFistFight It's pretty hard to get off in actual combat
[2:16:05] <Profmcstevie> Enemy forces infiltrated by sucker punching oni
[2:16:45] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight I mean yeah, how're you sposed to stay hard when someone's trying to shove a sword through you Kappa
[2:16:53] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, the big wind up doesn't have any hyper armor
[2:17:06] <Kghaleon> These guys are pushovers
[2:17:22] <darkelfdebauchery> is pat using the switch axe?
[2:17:31] <+TopTieramisu> no
[2:17:33] <RubberFistFight> god those tutorial tips things pissed me off so much, they bugged out or something and the game was still trying to remind me i could burst counter in the final areas.
[2:17:37] <+TopTieramisu> he's using big fat katana
[2:17:37] <%Tragosavich> @darkelfdebauchery Odachi and fists
[2:17:38] <%notsoy> nah, it's greatsword

[2:23:06] <+UbiquitousLost> when in doubt do the back flip
[2:23:08] <$ImExtremelyManly> punch the wall
[2:23:18] <Kghaleon> SeemsGood
[2:23:20] <nuane> didnt even know that was an option
[2:23:24] <darkelfdebauchery> grab her by the snussy
[2:23:52] <RubberFistFight> there are a bunch of female yokai in this that you can tell the designers wanted to amp up the sex appeal but couldn't. Grey Bolt is another one.
[2:23:53] <Kghaleon> baited
[2:24:04] <Kghaleon> Pat's still mad about that cheese
[2:24:07] <%shurtal> CHOESE
[2:24:10] <RubberFistFight> Sucks, because Japan's traditional art frequently does the "interplay between sex and horror" thing.
[2:24:19] <+HuoShengdi> got a kiss from snek
[2:24:27] <KeiPrime> i mean don't forget this IS Team Ninja

[2:24:46] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat is afraid at
[2:24:52] <%RealThiele> divorce stream
[2:24:55] <%valriot> That bacdown LUL
[2:24:57] <RubberFistFight> @horsesaredumb go over to nexusmods and check out the "lewd yokai mod" and see just how hot she can be.
[2:25:02] <Daikaiju1Sadism> top 10 streamers dying on twitch
[2:25:07] <studleydoorite> why buy the snake more like it...
[2:25:14] <%Double_Tap_That> Smells like bitch in here, and it's definitely not Paige.

[2:34:57] <IntrepidEye> you mean bring Gief bread and cheese
[2:34:59] <%Monkeyweed21> at least its not just raw cheese
[2:34:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cheese and crackers are about to be my diet for the next few days
[2:35:01] <%brisk_dacat> Did you check for mold?
[2:35:03] <%watchmanfury> choese
[2:35:03] <Profmcstevie> The alert status of enemies seems super high, they smell your presence and slam the 180
[2:35:04] <+RandyFistburgers> Damn. I gotta go get my own
[2:35:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >make one
[2:35:09] <TheeRabbi> Notice Pat said ONE OF the good ones, implying if Paige ever leaves him, he has PLENTY of options.
[2:35:11] <akitanito> cheese is mold tho
[2:35:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Paige doesn't exist?
[2:35:15] <scrumbotime> When will I find someone who would bring me a cheese
[2:35:17] <%snugglepuggs> Wait the mold!
[2:35:30] <%NopeBadguy> wait, it's ALL mold?
[2:35:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Be sure to check as I gave myself FOOD POISIONING last week eating questionable shrimp
[2:35:34] <studleydoorite> do you know how much breadncheese you can get for the cost of one women
[2:35:39] <tanarath> Now you will join Paige in the moldverse.
[2:35:44] <scrumbotime> cheese is basically mold
[2:36:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cheese is edible mold
[2:36:17] <Kaji04> cheesy is tasty mold
[2:36:17] <%Dakuu75> yep
[2:36:20] <+polothegreatest> Blue cheese is
[2:36:23] <%AncelDeLambert> cheese is a bit more than "mold"
[2:36:25] <%Agami23> do you know about how they make figs?
[2:36:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> HOW DID WE EVER DISCOVER THIS
[2:36:28] <%AncelDeLambert> cheese is great
[2:36:28] <scrumbotime> I like the cheeses that they somehow slop out of bags into big orbs
[2:36:32] <%AncelDeLambert> slowly
[2:36:32] <%snugglepuggs> Cheese is milk mold
[2:36:32] <RubberFistFight> "we let milk go off in a really specific way and then put it in a cave for a month"
[2:36:37] <+bugz_munny> EAT THE UNKNOWN THING
[2:36:39] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:36:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> they experimented
[2:36:41] <%MidnightBurst12> time and luck
[2:36:41] <Badgerconda_> MAKA CHEESE
[2:36:41] <%valriot> It didnt LUL
[2:36:41] <@Ranryu692> it was a much simpler cheese
[2:36:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> The power of CHRIST
[2:36:42] <%Blank9> strain it and run water over it and make it really gross
[2:36:43] <akitanito> inb4 intelligent design
[2:36:44] <IntrepidEye> hundreds of years of trailer and error
[2:36:45] <tanarath> Not accident
[2:36:47] <AngryAsian5> Humanity is great at fucking up forwards LUL
[2:36:49] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt someone probably just let milk or yogurt go bad and said "eh fuck it"
[2:36:49] <%Agami23> figs are cursed, you dont want to know how someone made figs
[2:36:49] <Estwilde> that's just the optimized solution being done now
[2:36:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the first cheeses were like Cottage Cheese
[2:36:50] <Profmcstevie> The first cheese probably tasted gross
[2:36:50] <IntrepidEye> trail*
[2:36:51] <%CalderGaming> they've been tuning it for hundreds of years
[2:36:52] <Kaji04> they probably experimented further after the simple cheeses
[2:36:58] <%AncelDeLambert> the first person to make a cheese was a dude with milk in a calf-skin for a long journey
[2:37:00] <+CrabStealer> I feel like you can say that for a lot of food tbh
[2:37:01] <tanarath> Science, Pat
[2:37:01] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt they were probably trying to make meth, and ended upw tih cheese
[2:37:02] <%Monkeyweed21> EAT THE OLD MILK AND IT TASTA THE GOOD
[2:37:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> First person who made cheese likely accidently made it in a sheep stomach skin that they filled with milk
[2:37:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> AH! woman
[2:37:09] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt i believe back when milk was stored in sheep stomachs, the bacteria made it curdle in a specific way. It was basically discovered accidentally.
[2:37:11] <TheeRabbi> The original cheeses probably tasted like shit, honestly. it WASNT that convoluted back then, it has just been perfected since
[2:37:24] <Kghaleon> The more convoluted the process, the more money they can charge you.
[2:37:32] <+polothegreatest> cocoque is basicly spoiled milk with salt LUL
[2:37:33] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, the first cheese was basically cottage cheese
[2:37:37] <danknugglit> He did it
[2:37:38] <SaltyAzteca> Snoobas
[2:37:40] <%angryoptimist> Fresh cheese varieties are much simpler.  You're seeing, like, Advanced Level Cheese shit.
[2:37:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want Snek to step on me
[2:37:43] <@Ranryu692> Pat must have turned his age to 99 when he started the game
[2:37:43] <+TopTieramisu> plague would love it
[2:37:54] <+Sendrak70> Is that snake lady a mammal? If not, then why boobas?
[2:37:54] <%valriot> Plague definitely should not play this
[2:37:57] <studleydoorite> cottage cheese Kreygasm
[2:37:57] <%Axellogic> He hates how nioh plays too much
[2:38:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this is WAY too Anime for Plague
[2:38:00] <whimwhisp> but snek has no feet..
[2:38:06] <DragonOfWarZro> I hope pat doesn't use moonlit snow, it makes odachi so boring
[2:38:06] <%Broand> plague would either love it or hate it
[2:38:10] <tanarath> :)
[2:38:13] <IntrepidEye> Kasha specifically is right up his alley. Maybe Titty Eboshi too
[2:38:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Plague sadly is incapable of even downloading this, currently
[2:38:17] <+bluestbee> So does this game just completely invalidate Nioh 1? Like should I even play Nioh 1 anymore if this game is available to me?
[2:38:20] <Profmcstevie> This game needs too much "young mans skills" for Plague
[2:38:24] <sirrice77> I think he knows about the sneks but otherwise plague would hate this game
[2:38:29] <RubberFistFight> god i wanna show you guys the modded screenshots but i don't wanna be the obnoxious guy blasting that shit across people's feeds unasked-for >_<

[2:45:22] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:45:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Saito Dosan was a pretty cool dude irl
[2:45:25] <+TopTieramisu> i thought he was gonna mis it
[2:45:27] <RubberFistFight> @Havictos the spirit stones? MASSIVE spoilers
[2:45:28] <+TopTieramisu> miss8
[2:45:29] <RubberFistFight> so can't say
[2:45:35] <ss_goku3> how are the mind goblins
[2:45:54] <DragonOfWarZro> I wonder what sword they were talking about
[2:45:56] <+theoldone001> AyyLMAOS are annoying too
[2:45:57] <RubberFistFight> @ss_goku3 he seems to be having a great time so i'd say Nioh 1 therapy killed them.
[2:46:00] <TheotherKristian> part skipper lol
[2:46:35] <President_valentine> if your break their ki with a yokai counter and immediately grab you'll do it in your yokai form
[2:46:47] <+TopTieramisu> COMMAND GRAB
[2:46:48] <akitanito> lol grabbed
[2:46:50] <%JoshManVGH> LUL
[2:47:01] <RubberFistFight> "you're not so bad" - proceeds to get trounced
[2:47:08] <+TopTieramisu> kinda lucky there
[2:47:09] <akitanito> good recovery
[2:47:18] <+Havictos> I didn't hate Nioh 1 but I love Nioh 2 too much to go back.
[2:47:26] <RubberFistFight> two down, one to go
[2:47:29] <%JoshManVGH> Aaaaall part of the plan
[2:47:43] <President_valentine> Nioh 1 is a good game 2 is just so much better
[2:47:44] <+Havictos> Admittedly not far but it feels pretty good.
[2:47:45] <Kghaleon> Skipping Nioh 1 is like skipping Dark souls for DS3
[2:47:55] <+TopTieramisu> nioh 1 is like a worse, earlier model of your digital device. why go back?
[2:48:03] <DragonOfWarZro> Exactly
[2:48:04] <danknugglit> You can still use yokai abilities and counter while out of stamina to reset faster
[2:48:05] <+TopTieramisu> nioh 1 isn't that important
[2:48:06] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> last one you can just shoot at if you want
[2:48:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Kghaleon naaah

[2:51:34] <%Bluwizard21> i really need to lose focus more then
[2:51:35] <+TopTieramisu> i'm losing focus right now. still waiting
[2:51:36] <wolverinewaswrong> the snakes are the worst in this game
[2:51:37] <Josef_Stryker> SNEK
[2:51:38] <President_valentine> If you break their ki they get short hair
[2:51:39] <Profmcstevie> *loses focus* ......well
[2:51:42] <Estwilde> as it should be
[2:51:43] <%Broand> wow you really wacked off that snake
[2:51:44] <wolverinewaswrong> worst snakes in gaming honestly
[2:52:00] <RubberFistFight> @wolverinewaswrong * best
[2:52:05] <RubberFistFight> look at the rack
[2:52:07] <+Havictos> do combo
[2:52:11] <californaya> it was really more of a whack on
[2:52:13] <scrumbotime> being able to ki charge into a punch is just nuts
[2:52:13] <DragonOfWarZro> Flying bolts are pretty hot
[2:52:22] <President_valentine> its best used when they're recovering
[2:52:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> luckily the antidotes are plentiful
[2:52:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Just Flayed beast it pat
[2:52:56] <%JoshManVGH> But it doesn't suck!
[2:53:07] <Kghaleon> You haven't, you didn't even reach poop castle
[2:53:12] <%valriot> theres like double the enemies in this
[2:53:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the enemy variety in this game is WAY bigger
[2:53:13] <+Kekama> yeah only bosses felt different
[2:53:18] <+JustToWatch> that is one of the biggest problems
[2:53:19] <artoflec> nah not true there was like half the roster left
[2:53:20] <+theoldone001> I just like that you can make your own character, makes fashion and shit add longevity
[2:53:31] <%hax_metatron> Team Ninja still needs to improve their level design in the future though. It gets so boring in Nioh 2 later :/
[2:53:36] <+WildcardM> this one has so many cool ass enemies
[2:53:43] <defaultname3887> nioh 2 has what it feels like triple the enemy variety
[2:53:48] <Kghaleon> Nioh 1 was cool because you're western dude fighting yokai and legendary samurai. This game you're random japan man.
[2:54:03] <herbcgaming> Hey Pat ling time fan first time watcher
[2:54:18] <RubberFistFight> @Kghaleon not actually random though, not truly. half-random, maybe.
[2:54:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> why do you pronounce the w so hard in sword
[2:54:25] <RubberFistFight> can't say much else due to spoilers
[2:54:29] <+theoldone001> William was a paper tissue for a character, Japan Man is an improvement
[2:54:34] <Kghaleon> @RubberFistFight mute too
[2:54:41] <ytwitchmeng> Is fire still its weakness?
[2:54:42] <+Havictos> to fuck with you that's why
[2:54:44] <warlish> love you pat
[2:54:48] <+KiwiRedgrave> ah yes, like the word know
[2:54:48] <+JustToWatch> who could have thought the poison slime would poison you
[2:54:52] <shiny_prinny> i have to say the word, i'm using the whole word
[2:54:55] <Profmcstevie> Why letter in word no say? is trick???
[2:54:55] <%AnthroMetal> sWORD
[2:54:55] <DragonOfWarZro> Nioh 2  has every basic enemy from 1 except the stone bros iirc
[2:54:56] <+TopTieramisu> so is your last name pronounced boy vin?
[2:54:56] <RubberFistFight> @theoldone001 William was a real guy too though
[2:54:57] <+aWanderingKaivo> you can also be random japan lady, and choice is good
[2:54:58] <+Havictos> for the lulz
[2:55:01] <%retrosadness> @doc_ock_rokc because he is a demon man
[2:55:02] <KaiserMario> Should I say "SORD"
[2:55:05] <%notsoy> like pterodactyl
[2:55:06] <%Dakuu75> Are you new here?
[2:55:08] <+polothegreatest> Zords
[2:55:09] <%livlinn> sWord
[2:55:12] <%DianaTheAscian> That's like telling people rats can swim
[2:55:15] <%livlinn> woolieFUN
[2:55:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> You pronounce cool whip as "Cool Wa Hip" don't  you?
[2:55:20] <Tracazoid> The British pronounce aluminum wrong all the time
[2:55:28] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[2:55:32] <+Havictos> yo this monkey has got moves
[2:55:34] <+theoldone001> Like Max saying G-Host
[2:55:36] <+TopTieramisu> they pronoucne it how they spell it
[2:55:38] <+JustToWatch> Pat watched Prosnorkulus and it had a lasting impact on his psyche
[2:55:38] <%JoshManVGH> Swards
[2:55:40] <+Br0kuyasu> isnt not pronouncing letters like half of speaking french?
[2:55:41] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, the French put useless letters in their words all the time
[2:55:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> @theoldone001 so is Hideyoshi, both games take a historical person and super exaggerate and go crazy with them.
[2:55:49] <RubberFistFight> i'm pretty sure it's meant to be pronounced with a very soft w - like it's not truly silent like the k in knife is.
[2:55:53] <warlish> attack his weak spot for massive damage
[2:56:01] <+tempestzephyr> Why would you DO that, pat, that's called LYING, No offense LUL
[2:56:08] <RubberFistFight> @theoldone001 I was kinda trying not to blow that one wide open just yet...
[2:56:17] <KaiserMario> Sue Word
[2:56:25] <DragonOfWarZro> Oh god the crabs
[2:56:40] <RubberFistFight> @DragonOfWarZro they make shampoo for that now Kappa
[2:56:42] <ytwitchmeng> Hammer Jack!
[2:56:43] <scrumbotime> Pat has never lied in his life, the truth was just incorrect
[2:56:44] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:56:55] <+JustToWatch> quick aggro more enemies
[2:56:58] <%Axellogic> make a bigger enemy train pat you arent fighting enough yet
[2:57:18] <+Havictos> Hey it's Woolie's favorite.
[2:57:25] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt when they're out of ki they stagger on hit so use it to punish them as much as possible
[2:57:30] <kiyoso_kiyo> I see pat is still rocking the ippon odachi
[2:57:32] <%livlinn> is that Ippondatara?
[2:57:36] <@QueequegTheater> Why dodge the red attacks instead of parry them?
[2:57:43] <DragonOfWarZro> Ye
[2:57:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> @theoldone001 well your character's name is known in like the opening mission :p
[2:58:02] <TheeRabbi> YOu beat him off good, Pat
[2:58:03] <+Havictos> @QueequegTheater Because he's a coward
[2:58:03] <RubberFistFight> I was saying it as you were doing that, plus time delay, smartass LUL
[2:58:07] <RubberFistFight> but yeah
[2:58:08] <RubberFistFight> you're not wrong
[2:58:08] <artoflec> Pat have you figured out how to deal with command grabs even when they flash red? i dont understand how it works
[2:58:09] <scrumbotime> Their advice was so good you followed it instinctively
[2:58:21] <akitanito> LUL
[2:58:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat remember to exhale, this clears your lungs so you and inhale
[2:58:29] <%VashyronM> will you though
[2:58:32] <@QueequegTheater> You tell em Pat
[2:58:35] <%AgniBrandt> You heard him chat, never help ever again
[2:58:35] <%livlinn> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:58:35] <DragonOfWarZro> If you counter too late on grabs u still get grabbed
[2:58:36] <RubberFistFight> Oh I don't need your help to look stupid, Pat, I'm capable of that entirely on my own Kappa
[2:58:39] <scrumbotime> Every time big good
[2:58:39] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt Pat did you know the glowy part of the enemies are their weak spots
[2:58:40] <%Axellogic> Well have you used a yokai skill to dodge a grab yet? I told you to do that :V
[2:58:42] <rReizs> slime ill like fire arisen
[2:58:48] <studleydoorite> donate 100 subs
[2:58:52] <+bluestbee> Surprised I can't see this dude over your shoulder with how hard he's backseating LUL
[2:58:52] <Kghaleon> Fight the boss once without destroying the statues, otherwise you'll have no idea what the significance is.
[2:58:56] <President_valentine> Wall buddy
[2:59:02] <artoflec> LUL
[2:59:02] <+Havictos> He loved it
[2:59:02] <%livlinn> LUL
[2:59:06] <%notsoy> backflips are always cool
[2:59:07] <%Blank9> I do backflips every day
[2:59:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> @QueequegTheater some times its safer and brute's burst counter doesn't work well at all for some red attacks since its an interrupt
[2:59:09] <+HellCopter> Backflip is AGGRESSIVE
[2:59:18] <artoflec> rocketto punch
[2:59:24] <+bluestbee> Backflips ALWAYS sick
[2:59:31] <+aWanderingKaivo> but when it DOES work well its great
[2:59:33] <RubberFistFight> yeah this place isn't great
[2:59:38] <+theoldone001> LUL LUL
[2:59:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hyuck. I mean yep

[3:00:04] <DragonOfWarZro> Look for the flowers Streamer
[3:00:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> @PatStaresAt sacred arrows work way better vs yokai if you wanna range em
[3:00:05] <TheeRabbi> Yeah, shooting snakes is hard, bud
[3:00:07] <artoflec> the mission in general is a difficulty spike imo, way more enemies than the previous missions had in a place
[3:00:29] <+theoldone001> Looking at the side profile of them Boobas they are pretty ridiculous lol
[3:00:34] <%kknutson4> What a hero
[3:00:44] <Tracazoid> He's got a knife!
[3:01:01] <RubberFistFight> @theoldone001 they're better without the hair in the way. thank god for the pc modding community i tell you what.
[3:01:16] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt look across the lake

[3:01:42] <artoflec> so yeah sometimes its not an enemy 👀
[3:01:44] <%Axellogic> You did it the hard way pat
[3:01:51] <RubberFistFight> In the dark realm, the thing generating it is ALWAYS surrounded by ghostly spider-lily flowers.
[3:02:05] <%Agami23> yup, didnt even use your purity talismans for it either
[3:02:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> I actually never pieced that together
[3:02:16] <+TopTieramisu> just break the statue first
[3:02:18] <@QueequegTheater> rush the statue
[3:02:18] <shiny_prinny> easy way is kill statue first
[3:02:18] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> destroying the statue first
[3:02:21] <+Havictos> ?
[3:02:22] <%Axellogic> you could have broken the statue first and theyd all have been out of ki
[3:02:22] <artoflec> sometimes theres just a thing you can break and it will kill everything
[3:02:24] <%VashyronM> destroy the statue first
[3:02:26] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> shoot statue
[3:02:27] <soflicar> destroy the statue first
[3:02:30] <+TopTieramisu> well it was visible

[3:06:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> btw the snake arms have their own hp, odachi high attacks are good at hitting them
[3:06:20] <Parapattern> You do SO little damage
[3:06:21] <Zombrocom> Odachi is a good weapon for this boss at least

[3:07:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah reach for the snek arms is great
[3:07:31] <%valriot> The Ippon skill on its head is big W

[3:08:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> not having to deal with the arms in dark realm is great
[3:08:12] <+HellCopter> Snake slap
[3:08:18] <RubberFistFight> @TopTieramisu this is his second attempt and he's fucking bossing it
[3:08:20] <SaltyAzteca> yea dont do that
[3:08:21] <Zombrocom> Doin good so far
[3:08:26] <%Vextalyst> This boss is a fuck buuut it has one of the best abilities in the game
[3:08:28] <%Axellogic> The boss isnt bad if you keep hitting his snake hands and head when exposed
[3:08:28] <%Dakuu75> this boss "music" sucks ass though.
[3:08:35] <artoflec> if a snake had arms would those arms just be snakes artofl1Hm - Team Ninja
[3:08:45] <+HuoShengdi> doing real well
[3:08:56] <Daikaiju1Sadism> No SNIDDIES NotLikeThis
[3:09:08] <%Axellogic> He takes massive damage when you kill them even if they seperate

[3:10:17] <%kknutson4> wow
[3:10:18] <Laecerelius> Snake core's great
[3:10:18] <+Local16> Good job man that's usually a sticking point
[3:10:19] <+TopTieramisu> good stuff
[3:10:20] <+Kekama> vury noice
[3:10:20] <Zombrocom> Max has here for hours LUL
[3:10:25] <toahmes> Didn't even get hit by the grab
[3:10:26] <%Paperware> Funny how Pat can go from getting stomped in 2 seconds to just shitting on the boss next try
[3:10:28] <+hrudzie_1> snake core very broken in closed spaces
[3:10:29] <%Agami23> its fun to help people with the fight
[3:10:30] <%Tragosavich> The smoke boss was way harder
[3:10:30] <soflicar> btw if you didn't destroy the statues the room has poison in the room
[3:10:32] <+bluestbee> Ooh soul core too
[3:10:32] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt that boss is an absolute wall for so many people. it took me like 8 hours of back-to-back attempts. That was legitimately one of the most impressive runs I've ever seen.
[3:10:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah his soul core is busted, it used to be even crazier because it cost less to use
[3:10:42] <sirrice77> On launch people were destroyed by that boss
[3:10:42] <Psyramics> this fucker took me hours in the network test
[3:10:46] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt Legit one of the best soul cores in the game
[3:10:47] <shiny_prinny> it's decent if you use paralysis
[3:10:54] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you remember this boss from SMT? It's called Yato no Kami there
[3:11:02] <$SGrim> Noice
[3:11:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's SICK
[3:11:05] <+HellCopter> it's so evil
[3:11:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> Strength bill represent
[3:11:07] <%SharkMissile> SharkMissile is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[3:11:08] <%SharkMissile> SharkMissile gifted a Tier 1 sub to heyitsbrian! 
[3:11:08] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> i spent a night doing that with tonfas. fuck me
[3:11:10] <artoflec> yeah that's one of the sickest odachis LUL
[3:11:10] <shiny_prinny> and it's cool as fuck
[3:11:10] <%SharkMissile> Dude, amazing job
[3:11:13] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt  The soul you got is busted too. Not fuck busted but, busted
[3:11:13] <%Dakuu75> metal
[3:11:21] <TallYoda08> atpGasm atpGasm atpGasm
[3:11:23] <+Gorgonzolini> @Axellogic Idk, I watched one of my friends struggle against the snake for probably almost two hours total. He was exclusively using the fists, but still. Pat's just a god gamer.
[3:11:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> that would match well with snake lady soul core
[3:11:33] <DragonOfWarZro> I cant believe pat paid off the boss to lose
[3:11:36] <President_valentine> Works well with a paralysis build
[3:11:37] <+aWanderingKaivo> since that one is on demand paralysis
[3:11:54] <+HuoShengdi> watch your weight pat
[3:11:58] <GilliamYaeger> Fuma Ninja set looks real fuckin' nice
[3:12:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> watch your weight
[3:12:02] <artoflec> yellow weight now elaISee
[3:12:10] <kiyoso_kiyo> C agility ):
[3:12:21] <+DeaconBluesClues> Strength weapons tend to be the bear choice in soul likes
[3:12:32] <+Havictos> fuck that get huge
[3:12:36] <+TopTieramisu> bear choice 🤔
[3:12:38] <%watchmanfury> looking respectable
[3:12:39] <shiny_prinny> just short of 200 toughness
[3:12:39] <artoflec> that sheath design is CRAZY
[3:12:44] <KaiserMario> What's Monster Hunter nonsense?
[3:12:45] <TerrifyingRei_05> soul core!
[3:12:51] <%Axellogic> @Axellogic biggest thing the snake punishes is if you constantly back off, if you dont stop attacking it you can stagger lock it pretty easily
[3:13:24] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> im salty dont worry
[3:13:26] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Nioh's one of those games that clicks REALLY WELL when it clicks
[3:13:40] <SaltyAzteca> EVERYONE'S SNEK
[3:13:45] <mikeriffic> his stand reveals itself
[3:13:57] <kiyoso_kiyo> Never understood why our character couldn’t speak
[3:14:02] <+TopTieramisu> exposition stand
[3:14:02] <KaiserMario> Is this Susanoo?
[3:14:07] <AnacondaVirtue> Here's your daddy
[3:14:07] <%Axellogic> He was actually a super badass demon hunter in the past
[3:14:08] <%watchmanfury> ITS YER DAD
[3:14:10] <soflicar> the viper of mino
[3:14:13] <+Havictos> He Smashed that yokai puss

[3:14:19] <%octavian_wolf> FATHER
[3:14:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> @GilliamYaeger There's a mod on pc that makes it red too
[3:14:21] <%notsoy> chasing that yussy
[3:14:24] <scrumbotime> ITS YER DA
[3:14:25] <+polothegreatest> PogChamp PogChamp
[3:14:36] <TerrifyingRei_05> fratha
[3:14:43] <Zombrocom> So yeah, that's your dad, and that dagger is why your immortal. How bout that.
[3:14:47] <+JustToWatch> Yokussy
[3:14:53] <Kghaleon> Nioh 2 is kinda dumb.
[3:14:54] <President_valentine> that yokai pussy changed him
[3:14:57] <%SharkMissile> He let your mom die, jerk
[3:15:00] <+SilverDevilfish> Thanks for the Snake dad
[3:15:01] <SaltyAzteca> THE SQUAD
[3:15:02] <mikeriffic> You cant mix the races without the Time cube being defeated first
[3:15:05] <+HuoShengdi> your mom gave the dagger to you
[3:15:07] <+TopTieramisu> the story is always dumb in nioh
[3:15:08] <%Monkeyweed21> that wizard had the sharingan or w/e
[3:15:22] <%machshop> duncan no
[3:15:27] <Zombrocom> And after knowing him for 5 seconds, your dad is dead
[3:15:33] <SaltyAzteca> Narrator: He in fact, did not got it.
[3:15:33] <+TopTieramisu> that voice acting LUL
[3:15:36] <+tempestzephyr> he'll be fine
[3:15:38] <%watchmanfury> THATS YOUR DAD AND NOW HE'S GONE FOREVER WAVE BYEEEE
[3:15:39] <President_valentine> who plays nioh for the story
[3:15:40] <wqorst> awful
[3:15:42] <%Tragosavich> A world were you can live with snek ladies is what he fighting for
[3:15:48] <%Axellogic> He lasted so long
[3:15:50] <%Monkeyweed21> nyeeehhhh
[3:15:51] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> nyehh
[3:15:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> NYYYEAAAAAAHHH SEE!
[3:15:56] <+AnthraxJohnson> Neeeehhh
[3:15:57] <akitanito> did he even stop one
[3:16:02] <Kghaleon> dude lasted 2 seconds
[3:16:08] <mr_saturday93> I never understood why dafuq does he have a British accent
[3:16:09] <KaiserMario> Lasted as long as Billy in Predator
[3:16:12] <Kghaleon> You saw 10% of Nioh 1
[3:16:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[3:16:14] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> speed bump dad
[3:16:15] <artoflec> Nioh 1's story takes off after the 2nd island
[3:16:19] <%SharkMissile> Hey, Cat clock
[3:16:21] <President_valentine> Cool lady is back
[3:16:22] <%FunkyStreams> boobas?
[3:16:25] <%Blank9> the most exciting thing that happened was a ninja pulling a cat out of his coat
[3:16:25] <SaltyAzteca> ERRYONE'S BRI'ISH
[3:16:27] <+Havictos> here's action girl
[3:16:31] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Tbf Pat you just played the first mission over and over
[3:16:34] <%Agami23> nioh 1 gets some stuff. also gets some waifus
[3:16:34] <DragonOfWarZro> Time for the Fool of Owari!
[3:16:34] <rReizs> he also saw cute gril just like here
[3:16:36] <+TopTieramisu> BRI'ISH
[3:16:37] <+V3RTIGO_222> booba sneks
[3:16:38] <%Bluwizard21> daddy issues protag
[3:16:42] <Josef_Stryker> I'm surprised Pat isn't playing this with Japanese Voice Acting
[3:16:43] <%Tragosavich> Nioh story kinda only comes up in the DLC.  Least that the only part of the story i remember
[3:16:45] <mr_saturday93> Why British though
[3:16:50] <%Axellogic> Both Nioh 1 and 2 have a habit of making everything interesting in the story happen offscreen and they tell you about it later
[3:16:56] <%Monkeyweed21> the only story in Nioh is that Nobunaga is a chad and wizards are evil
[3:16:58] <SaltyAzteca> SNEK ATTEK
[3:16:59] <%Paperware> That's a real good spirit for poison builds
[3:17:04] <+hrudzie_1> this is the best shit
[3:17:10] <%Blank9> it's incredibly good
[3:17:11] <Laecerelius> Snek can hit many times if you aim it right and have it bounce around
[3:17:12] <%Blank9> 2 hits
[3:17:13] <%Axellogic> IT copies enemy buffs
[3:17:17] <artoflec> Nioh 1 is about beating the shit out of the Queen's best dudes
[3:17:21] <KaiserMario> Become Orochimaru
[3:17:22] <scrumbotime> hit help to read it
[3:17:24] <%machshop> ippon datara i know him from the megami tenseis
[3:17:25] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt mujina core lets you copy enemy buffs by locking on
[3:17:27] <+hrudzie_1> in closed spaces its amazing
[3:17:28] <Zombrocom> Mujina has no active, but gives you buffs when the enemy buffs themselves
[3:17:31] <shiny_prinny> Mujina is chance to copy enemy buffs when they buff
[3:17:36] <President_valentine> It copies buffs
[3:17:38] <%Axellogic> It has no attack skill but copies any buffs on your enemy
[3:17:47] <SaltyAzteca> DICE ROLL BABY
[3:17:48] <%watchmanfury> HOT GARBAGE
[3:17:55] <SaltyAzteca> or coin flip
[3:18:01] <+polothegreatest> Mujuma
[3:18:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> aberrant soldier is nifty
[3:18:09] <%Axellogic> Its better on higherdifficulties
[3:18:10] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> snake core really good in cramped areas
[3:18:11] <%DashXero> Oh neat. Pat's back on the Nioh wagon.
[3:18:12] <Kghaleon> always do dojo missions first
[3:18:15] <+Havictos> Content baby
[3:18:19] <defaultname3887> next cutceneee thoo
[3:18:28] <artoflec> yeah this game's long as fuck elaPain
[3:18:28] <+JustToWatch> @patstaresat the dojo missions let you unlock better skills
[3:18:30] <%watchmanfury> just a tip once you change regions you can't go back
[3:18:30] <GilliamYaeger> NEXT REGION
[3:18:32] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah if you have dojo missions those will unlock new skills
[3:18:40] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You really want to do most of the dojo missions and submissions off stream, but if you do duels let us watch, they are generally pretty good
[3:18:42] <%Axellogic> try to get to barrier talisman
[3:18:43] <%Tragosavich> I would get all talismens for magic first
[3:18:45] <GilliamYaeger> @watchmanfury Yeah you can, what are you talking about?
[3:18:47] <+Havictos> talismans are pretty good
[3:18:48] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Rush Barrier Talisman
[3:18:50] <shiny_prinny> barrier and sloth are good to build towards
[3:18:51] <%Tragosavich> Just to be ready for all situations
[3:18:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> Barrier talisman is GOAT
[3:18:54] <%Monkeyweed21> get barrier
[3:18:55] <SaltyAzteca> Whats the second wall in Nioh 2?
[3:18:59] <%watchmanfury> @watchmanfury wait you can?
[3:19:03] <@QueequegTheater> Bottom left
[3:19:04] <%Axellogic> south west
[3:19:05] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> down
[3:19:08] <%JokerNewby> JokerNewby subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Love the stream pat. Pet babies
[3:19:09] <Zombrocom> Southwest IIRC
[3:19:10] <+Inferno_Icon> barrier is the shit
[3:19:10] <%Bluwizard21> SLOTH
[3:19:14] <President_valentine> push square and you can see a list
[3:19:15] <%Broand> I was a fan of caltrops in Nioh 1 as my main method to slow dudes down
[3:19:15] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> you can come back the prior regions
[3:19:18] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt hit square and go through the list, it's a bit easier
[3:19:19] <Laecerelius> Yeah barrier is OP
[3:19:19] <Kghaleon> Sloth is also good if you want enemies to move slowly.
[3:19:19] <+hrudzie_1> very good for dark zones
[3:19:26] <Zombrocom> Barrier basically counters the yokai realm shit
[3:19:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> the regen is super strong
[3:19:28] <kiyoso_kiyo> Click square for a better list
[3:19:31] <%Axellogic> Extending purification range is great too
[3:19:40] <President_valentine> Hit Square Pat
[3:19:47] <Kghaleon> Ninjutsu feathers are godly later
[3:19:49] <%Agami23> shuriken can be useful
[3:19:54] <%JokerNewby> @PatStaresAt have you looked at titles?
[3:20:02] <%Axellogic> I reccomend north on shiftling
[3:20:03] <@QueequegTheater> It basically entirely negates the dark realm stamina debuff and lets you disenchant yokai puddles on contact
[3:20:04] <%Tragosavich> Do you have any hairlocks to use?  I think you picked up one?
[3:20:06] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Poison is good for that snake core
[3:20:07] <shiny_prinny> check bottom of feral tree
[3:20:11] <Laecerelius> The feathers are super strong if you hit the enemy when they're out of ki
[3:20:12] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> check for omnyou hair locks
[3:20:12] <RubberFistFight> the stuff over on the right is useful though
[3:20:12] <SaltyAzteca> It builds in value
[3:20:12] <%Axellogic> the healing skills are great on shiftling
[3:20:13] <artoflec> yeah shiftling's a bunch of teeny tiny passives
[3:20:18] <scrumbotime> my heavy into ninja build has so many slots full of bombs
[3:20:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt get the heal on spirit core
[3:20:22] <%watchmanfury> bottom trees are almost always trash in this game
[3:20:22] <Zombrocom> Boring but good stat boosts though
[3:20:34] <%Axellogic> Its at the top
[3:20:36] <+aWanderingKaivo> at the top
[3:20:39] <shiny_prinny> thats top of brute side
[3:20:45] <%Axellogic> youll get there pretty quick
[3:20:45] <Laecerelius> You heal when you pick up a spirit core
[3:21:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> those green skills you equip to your weapon moves in skill customization
[3:21:28] <Zombrocom> Oppurtunist is neat because it's a parry that works on everything, not just human enemies
[3:21:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that sounded like a child
[3:21:35] <%Axellogic> I reccomend filling out any moves you dont have yet on fist
[3:21:36] <Kghaleon> Most of the fastest speedrunners go down the Ninjutsu feather tree since they are OP
[3:21:51] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> where's the one that refills your stamina when you do a successful parry?
[3:21:53] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Do duels on camera too
[3:21:59] <Laecerelius> yeah there's tons of side missions
[3:22:01] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah there are some crazy animation cancelling you can do with the feather moves or something
[3:22:08] <%Tragosavich> Duels are cool
[3:22:11] <%Blank9> yeah if they're good, just redo them
[3:22:13] <%valriot> Theres SOME late game sub missions youll wanna do on camera
[3:22:16] <@DakotaMacDoodle> thats  a good idea to be honest
[3:22:16] <SaltyAzteca> Yes theyre *quite* long
[3:22:18] <%Axellogic> Side missions are short main missions on long
[3:22:18] <%Monkeyweed21> there are some cool duel missions later yea
[3:22:23] <defaultname3887> some one give him a list of the cool secondsry missions
[3:22:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Nioh 2 is REAL LONG especially after DLC
[3:22:34] <defaultname3887> the one with the spoilers and the REDACTED
[3:22:39] <Setaro> What level is Pat's character?
[3:22:41] <%FunkyStreams> had a beer filled up and everything, lol.
[3:22:52] <%Dakuu75> \Lali-ho~
[3:22:55] <%Tragosavich> I think I put like 250 hours alone in Nioh 1
[3:23:39] <%justcallmebobplease> Just popped in, how far is Pat in Nioh 2?
[3:23:55] <President_valentine> Just beat snake boss

[3:24:11] <%FunkyStreams> @justcallmebobplease bif titted snakes
[3:25:08] <%justcallmebobplease> @FunkyStreams ...Yatsu-no-Kami?  I... don't remember that having tits...
[3:26:41] <%Axellogic> @FunkyStreams dont be hatin on Yatsu just cause she aint packing
[3:26:54] <%Buttlo> Has he been punching more minotaurs in the dick?
[3:27:28] <President_valentine> he's been stabbing snake ladies in the titts
[3:27:51] <Kghaleon> There are hidden things on the map if you click around, besides missions. You can get gear and items.
[3:28:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> get worse at games Pat jeez
[3:28:18] <%Axellogic> No Raid chain us again

[3:28:50] <%livlinn> PrideShrug
[3:28:53] <%Dakuu75> I'm going through Shadowbringer right now. it's legit hype.
[3:28:53] <Josef_Stryker> TBF Shadowbringers is REALLY good
[3:29:17] <%watchmanfury> I like questions more than answers
[3:29:17] <%JokerNewby> shadowbringers probably better if youre new
[3:29:19] <%G_Thunders> Shadowbringers has the benefit of being a standalone story pretty much
[3:29:28] <%DianaTheAscian> I like shadowbingers dungeons more
[3:29:34] <@QueequegTheater> For levelling crafters, I should be doing leves to 50, then collectables/deliveries to 90, yes?
[3:29:49] <%shurtal> is 11 free if you pay for it?
[3:29:49] <@Ranryu692> ???
