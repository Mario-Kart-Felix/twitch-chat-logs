[0:33:45] <+PARARScs> everyone loves sly cooper
[0:33:46] <%ScreamLord> I don't think SuckerPunch has made a straight up bad game yet
[0:33:46] <Miikaaeeel> They've never made a better game than Sly 2 though
[0:33:47] <+Story_Ark> @jungos60 to be fair, theme parks in general are reopening in orlando, disney is actually the last to open. they definitely should all stay closed tho
[0:33:48] <+StrawberryPantsu> Don't like Infamous

[0:33:49] <rawrmeowxd> ICH HABE INFAMOUS GERN

[0:45:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige can run faster than a pony
[0:45:39] <+xddddsorandom> Enemies die when they are killed
[0:45:41] <+AcrutaLao> People die when they're killed, Pat.
[0:45:41] <+ragingbrachy> die :)
[0:45:41] <%legendscar01> Immortal
[0:45:42] <KinduVborrd> Do sword feel good?
[0:45:43] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Pro tip people died when they are killed
[0:45:43] <KidKaiser23> Yeah Paige has red hair
[0:45:45] <%dukenux> you missed a guy
[0:45:45] <gekizenbu> horse legs are fingers and horses are omnivorss
[0:45:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> There's a JUMP button 10/10IGN
[0:45:48] <Overloard> but paige has more leg per leg
[0:45:49] <%nmaten> lmao that stance
[0:45:50] <%mike2hands> SWORD GO SLASHHHH
[0:45:50] <%Blargimazombie> Pat would you say this game is... fun?
[0:45:52] <%dekkitout> I imagine she runs -when with proper motivation- runs like a Devilman Crybaby character
[0:45:52] <%srkAres> HUDs werent invented in ancient japan
[0:45:53] <%skizzuto> you're an invincible ghost
[0:45:56] <SilverFaustX> this takes place in 1274 ad
[0:45:58] <SpaceGuntank> man i miss Dynasty Warriors
[0:45:59] <%LunarRemix> Because tou haven't got your augmentations yet
[0:46:00] <BritishTyrannosaur> hit them with the pointy end
[0:46:03] <+xddddsorandom> TRUEEE
[0:46:03] <%konekoryugamine> REMEMBER: NO DARK SOULS!!
[0:46:03] <KidKaiser23> But Paige has red hair, that’s power
[0:46:06] <+necrocannibal2> sup
[0:46:08] <%a_goth_pancake> I wonder why this game is called 'Ghosts of Tsushima'...
[0:46:08] <%spiritofmojave> Is this gonna be a guaranteed 'fight till you inevitably die' sequence
[0:46:09] <+RichAnvils> GO BLUE TEAM
[0:46:10] <+JonJonRequiem> Blue good, red bad
[0:46:10] <mutantlunchbox1> Do horses have four legs or four arms?
[0:46:11] <+BIumen> yeah that was a legit problem in ww2
[0:46:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just like with sports
[0:46:14] <%MrBleeeh> this music is pretty good
[0:46:14] <+ragingbrachy> its like a basketball game
[0:46:16] <%ScreamLord> Remember when Loki turned into a Mare got fucked by a stallion and then gave birth to a 6-8 legged super horse that become Odin's steed?
[0:46:16] <ZE_Count> Friendly fire be bad
[0:46:18] <ittla> and then vietnam
[0:46:20] <DesertPenguin> That's totally how it happened
[0:46:22] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Red vs blue
[0:46:22] <+NightFox126> there a timed block?
[0:46:23] <+phat_gio> Looks like RISE of Rome starting mission
[0:46:25] <%bigboyeggo> everyone understood the red and blue oni
[0:46:25] <+xddddsorandom> Basketball teams
[0:46:27] <+RichAnvils> Shirts v Skins
[0:46:27] <LasagnaXaga> How much have I missed?
[0:46:29] <@SoFarFetched> "Leaders its time to pick our colors!"
[0:46:29] <SpaceGuntank> YEAH RED TEAM
[0:46:29] <+xeros720> friendly fire is kind of an issue
[0:46:30] <cosmicgoatee> i mean clearly how else would war work? It's not like we can wear matching ties
[0:46:31] <+Story_Ark> @patstaresat why would there be a HUD? they didnt have those during the war
[0:46:31] <+sjay449> suck it blues
[0:46:32] <%UvBenServed> "But I wanted to be a red guy!"
[0:46:34] <%Pappajimbo> we had to stop that after machine guns
[0:46:34] <mankeymania> i would suck at war cause i'm blind as fuck
[0:46:35] <%maenos2> donk donk donk donk donk yoooooooo~
[0:46:36] <KinduVborrd> Parries?
[0:46:36] <+NightFox126> 2 min
[0:46:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ya know, in Kabuki theatre, Blue was actually bad guy
[0:46:39] <BootyZipperooni> During the Civil War that was actually a huge issue, because the battlefield would get so dirty and smokey
[0:46:40] <MrIntake> @LasagnaXaga just started
[0:46:40] <RoboFussin> Shirts and Skins
[0:46:40] <%ChestMimik> As it turns out fighting for your life kinda makes it hard to distinguish friend and foe
[0:46:41] <+Thunder_Poo> Bearded Pat = Best Pat
[0:46:41] <aeonicvector> Awww shit, we're BOTH wearing the same armor, one of us has to change
[0:46:43] <+ragingbrachy> 👍
[0:46:43] <ThDark> The French wore BRIGHT BABY BLUE uniforms at the start of WWI and quickly came to realize that was a bad choice
[0:46:43] <Wookeh_> after enough fighting everyone is team red/brown though :)
[0:46:43] <%a_goth_pancake> "no I wanted blue tho"
[0:46:44] <%Nomad_Scholar> @PatStaresAt If you're the outsider, you wear black
[0:46:44] <+BoboDaHobo> he says as he tries to attack the same color
[0:46:47] <%ToneBacas> i wonder if they exploited that detail, and wore the enemies' colors to troll them
[0:46:47] <phantomsleeves> that’s why that one fight in three houses is dumb
[0:46:47] <mudapersona> how's combat feel so far?
[0:46:49] <VritraReiRei> @LasagnaXaga like 5 minutes of cutscences
[0:46:49] <%mike2hands> that's exactly i was thinkin
[0:46:50] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt THATS LITERALLY HOW ARMIES OPERATED BACK THEN PAT
[0:46:50] <+MidnightBurst12> yep. 100% historical fact :)
[0:46:51] <BaslerJones> Big Hat means FRIEND
[0:46:52] <+RichAnvils> Pat's Team is the browns
[0:46:53] <Picia000123> getting soaked in blood and mud is some fucked up shit
[0:46:53] <%JuliusGemstone> I'm not going to be really that guy. but armor seems not to mean anything...again.
[0:46:54] <cosmicgoatee> so this is feudal TF2 @patstaresat
[0:46:55] <ponch44> psaMenace

[0:47:07] <+akira_chong> Banner interface
[0:47:09] <+necrocannibal2> graphically this game looks great
[0:47:10] <%Thirtine> dyes differed from place to place because of the climate and what plants grew there

[0:49:49] <+Remery_> Your waifus
[0:49:49] <+RichAnvils> do you believe in ghost stories? cuz you're gonna be one
[0:49:49] <%spiritofmojave> no :)
[0:49:49] <chambatron> I studies YOUT blade
[0:49:50] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> that sweat drop
[0:49:53] <%michingmallecho> The sweat is dripping
[0:49:56] <+phat_gio> atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:49:56] <+ragingbrachy> D:
[0:49:56] <%Valdorick> Dishonor and still dead.
[0:49:57] <KazMkII> While you studied the blade I had sex
[0:49:57] <%legendscar01> So the Mongols knew english back in the day?
[0:49:57] <OldManDeckardCain> mongols had a lot of premarital sex LUL
[0:49:58] <KidKaiser23> You Mastered the Blade, I conquered your Culture
[0:49:58] <DesertPenguin> I didn't see head fall off, the body just fell over
[0:49:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Then he would be dishonored Pat
[0:49:59] <%dukenux> ...Did Sun Tzu write his Art of War by then?
[0:49:59] <collind99> so my hot(?) take is that Druckmann and ND are bad bosses but also most of the story criticism against the game and story that I’ve seen is dumb criticism
[0:50:00] <+it_was_too_long> dishonor
[0:50:00] <+akira_chong> The problem, as I hear it, with the samurai is that they were using vastly inferior technology to everyone else at the time but because Japan was so physically isolated, they didn't know that.
[0:50:01] <%Shadicara> That was a good scene
[0:50:01] <pennykettle_> honor is a stupid concept and why I generally dont care for these samurai games
[0:50:04] <%GingerStrawhat> Well then he probably would have talked to him
[0:50:05] <%mMayrro> they would have still died stumbo
[0:50:05] <%BinaryFireball> probs would've been fine

[1:07:34] <%Invlux> that's why Samurai would kill people on the roadside to test their new swords :)
[1:07:35] <Mister_McDerp> good old romanticized feudalism
[1:07:37] <%BlkFlameKami> pat has no honor
[1:07:38] <boomstickery> we are allowed to cut bitches in half so we have to try not to do that
[1:07:38] <%Adojim> the one good samurai clan

[1:07:44] <%mike2hands> @YakumoYomi LUL LUL
[1:07:46] <%Movemeister> Shin Chan :O
[1:07:47] <%Valdorick> Honor means sending filthy fucking plebs into the front line while a cav charge hits the enemy from behind and kills just as many of your guys as theirs.
[1:07:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Never use a rubber
[1:07:52] <%joylent_blue> but that's the BEST TIME

[1:07:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHAT
[1:07:57] <%bigboyeggo> "yo dude that's sick"
[1:08:01] <BritishTyrannosaur> Never use a sniper rifle
[1:08:02] <%Shadicara> Let's see how dishonorable pat is
[1:08:02] <%legendscar01> Always pull out
[1:08:03] <mostundesired> ... It is kind of cool though.
[1:08:04] <%aishman> Yo chat, hows the game so far?
[1:08:04] <%azure22900> lol weeb
[1:08:04] <nukle0nik> yeah the guy who lit one of your men on fire with his guard down, treat them with honor
[1:08:05] <$Clarke1010> how many times was his blade folded?
[1:08:08] <%Shadicara> LUL
[1:08:08] <%mike2hands> thats a cool shot
[1:08:08] <TafferAA> look at this pleb mongol
[1:08:10] <%darthrevan4ever> ahhh gotta love ignoring how shitty the samurai were.
[1:08:10] <KidKaiser23> Samurais in real life were actually dickheads and grossly abused power, Ninjas had better codes of ethic
[1:08:13] <%Thirtine> yoooo naginatas are cool as shit though
[1:08:15] <+akira_chong> So it looks like this is the thing that makes this totally not a story that would actually be made in Japan: the thought that an honor code isn't automatically the best idea.
[1:08:17] <+G_Thunders> Infamous lets go evil right? Does this game?
[1:08:18] <cosmicgoatee> twang on that shamisen son
[1:08:18] <%Movemeister> Spear is the ultimate weapon
[1:08:18] <%sleepers1mulant> POLEARMS ARE SUPERIOR
[1:08:18] <%Shadicara> Dead
[1:08:19] <%BlkFlameKami> right how of the tutorial getting hit
[1:08:22] <%PettyFunk> Stab a guy in the asshole on the toilet, and then write a history book about your righteous victory in battle
[1:08:24] <%MakotoPB> Throwing away your scabbard? Means to the death
[1:08:25] <%TheShockVox> @invlux Much like a cops, the title doesn’t automatically mean they have honor or are worthy of said title
[1:08:25] <%rdark_ksu> man some of the mongols had lame haircuts
[1:08:28] <+Zaramoth> please dont light me on fire like a bitch
[1:08:29] <%Promessa_EX> oops ur dead

[1:08:33] <%heartlesshealer> hope so
[1:08:35] <%DianaTheAscian> its day now
[1:08:35] <+worldbuildwithus> Spears are fucking rad
[1:08:36] <Louie_Salmon> So it has the sekiro mechanic?
[1:08:36] <%Shadicara> Spears have no honor pat
[1:08:37] <boomstickery> spear are op v swords
[1:08:38] <OldManDeckardCain> SPEARS HAVE NO HONOR
[1:08:38] <mastertwin2> you pauldron clips through your head...
[1:08:38] <%Nekros4442> Spears are rad and actually useful compared to a sword
[1:08:38] <%Thirtine> i want a naginata
[1:08:39] <%Valdorick> Spears are bitch weapons. Maces are where its at.

[1:08:39] <bleugh> nagamatama
[1:08:40] <%spiritofmojave> Switch to spear, katanas are weak shit
[1:08:42] <SomeAsianDood> SPEARS HAVE NO HONOR
[1:08:42] <%skizzuto> is that a second sword in your scabbard?
[1:08:42] <%dukenux> It's also what they'd mostly use in the battle
[1:08:42] <+professormorrigan> spears are the goat
[1:08:43] <+Dayube> spears suck
[1:08:43] <DSD24> Spears are super neat
[1:08:44] <mostundesired> Okay but why do these panels even exist?
[1:08:44] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> stabbed twice
[1:08:45] <nukle0nik> a samurai who was good with a sword was seen as being shit, being good with your sword meant that your archery sucked
[1:08:45] <%ha2ken> Pat will get toothpick...number go big
[1:08:47] <+NightFox126> wasnt she on watch?
[1:08:48] <ZE_Count> Spears are super OP so they have to nerf them in games.
[1:08:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> One shoulder pad is cooler than two
[1:08:50] <Ipsenscastle> Samurai were basically like the police today
[1:08:50] <%Promessa_EX> spears best
[1:08:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> All Samurai Are Bastards?
[1:08:54] <%dinnydanny777> So when do we unlock the Lightning powers
[1:08:54] <+nikoloas_> Naginata or bust
[1:08:55] <Ultimatefool> Fuck honor, spears are the longest
[1:08:55] <stabbityrabbit> It's always funny how samurai put so much stock in honor when all the most famous ones were notorious shitbags.
[1:08:56] <Ragnakawaii> Why would you use a spear when you can use a superior weapon, the Katana, which means Japanese Sword
[1:08:58] <%floralkami> yeah, Korea is DEFINITELY not importing this game
[1:08:58] <%joylent_blue> fire emblem taught me that Spears >>> Swords

[1:11:42] <+akira_chong> The problem with an honor code for soldiers is that it puts something above loyalty to the state. In this case, it's loyalty to the identity of your clan. This "no sneaking" crap is just PR for Clan Sakai, showing how much of big dick badasses they are

[1:25:25] <myriad_truth> Blood dulls your sword
[1:25:25] <+Tojan89> itll rust the fuck outta the blade
[1:25:26] <%chiluzza> you clean your blade before holstering or else the blood will stick
[1:25:26] <Giothegame> Don't want the blade getting all gunked up with blood
[1:25:27] <%barrakuta371> It's also to help keep it from rusting
[1:25:27] <DSD24> No you don't want the blade to get stuck
[1:25:27] <%Starotter70> I thought Blood rusts shit
[1:25:27] <+RestlessCorpse> Don't worry, ya'll. It's a generic revenge plot, so Pat hates it.
[1:25:27] <%Typhaeon> Blood oxidizes things
[1:25:28] <chambatron> Blood makes the blade rusty
[1:25:28] <%AncelDeLambert> @patstaresat blood and fat foul a blade and make it cut worse
[1:25:28] <rissaleigh14> Prepare to die
[1:25:28] <Spiralpower1620> This is just the MGS3 intro slySmug
[1:25:29] <%indig0bird> That's why you clean and oil it
[1:25:29] <%clockworknate> its like sharing needles
[1:25:30] <KinduVborrd> This looks like that boss arena from Ninja Gaiden
[1:25:30] <%PettyFunk> Also you never want blood inside your scabbard
[1:25:30] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Its done to keep the blade from rusting
[1:25:31] <%JobbedBone> its a dumb weeb thing
[1:25:31] <%bevyrage> cleaning the blood off of the blade also shows you have no regrets and are ready to duel
[1:25:33] <+LokimenD> @PatStaresAt Blood and fat bad for sword
[1:25:34] <+Skelegroove> Sword rusts easily
[1:25:36] <%M3djedx> It ducks up the blade
[1:25:37] <%PipIV> COAGULATED BLOOD IN SCABARD IS GROSS
[1:25:38] <$ragingbrachy> 4Head
[1:25:38] <%JD_Lars> Cakes up blade. Makes cutting worse too
[1:25:38] <%SolidusRex> Blood will make the blade nut
[1:25:40] <SquigglyLizard> blood and oils make swords turn crap
[1:25:40] <+AcrutaLao> HUEHUEHUE
[1:25:40] <+MidnightBurst12> blood is very wet
[1:25:42] <%legendscar01> From Rusting
[1:25:42] <%GingerStrawhat> I've also heard that it's so you know you are hitting the enemy
[1:25:42] <bleugh> muhahahaha
[1:25:43] <ittla> (Laughing.)
[1:25:44] <%Dementedpenguin> This guy has a super punchable face
[1:25:45] <SomeAsianDood> naw stops the blade from rusting
[1:25:45] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt doen't they do that to keep rust?
[1:25:46] <$Masamune195> "just because it looks really cool" is the name of the game pat
[1:25:46] <DesertPenguin> Iron in blood can rust
[1:25:48] <%dinnydanny777> Blood is full of metal
[1:25:48] <kratosdestroys> Blood Dulls the Blade so its also practical
[1:25:49] <Auriel_Astrum> DSP
[1:25:49] <+desfore> YES, it is a move invented during peace time, to honor the... presumably civillian you killed
[1:25:50] <+Th47guy> Japanese style knives rust really easy if they get moisture left on them.
[1:25:50] <%BeezusHrist> It's GENSHIRO 2.0
[1:25:50] <cosmicgoatee> he looks like DSP
[1:25:52] <%Thirtine> yeah do it
[1:25:52] <%GingerStrawhat> Squash match
[1:25:53] <%lunaraci> also it doesn't cut as good with the fat and blood
[1:25:54] <%Captain_Doomsday> This is about REVENGE

[1:31:24] <%spiritofmojave> Honor except when it comes to foreigners

[1:31:29] <%toastybites> The joke in Asia is that everyone hates the Japanese

[1:43:07] <$RealThiele> ew
[1:43:07] <%Invlux> the contrast is fucked
[1:43:09] <%Shadicara> Yo I love that
[1:43:12] <CookieCutter007> DansGame
[1:43:12] <DesertPenguin> WHat did they do to the audio?
[1:43:14] <megakruemel> the colors of the game are so pretty though
[1:43:17] <+CptBritches> I just like that it's straight up called Kurosawa Mode
[1:43:17] <%GingerStrawhat> It sounds more in line with older films
[1:43:18] <%count_bob> Super over exposed.
[1:43:18] <@SoFarFetched> Probably go f it with the old movies.
[1:43:18] <%PettyFunk> @cobalt_phoenix_ He's been playing for a while but you just missed the introduction/prologue
[1:43:20] <kratosdestroys> Play the Flute
[1:43:20] <+MoonObscure> yes agreed
[1:43:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> ewww
[1:43:21] <%FutaSnek> True
[1:43:21] <@SoFarFetched> to fit*
[1:43:22] <MrDonTacos_> wat
[1:43:22] <%Mr_Pylon> ugh, it's all too flat
[1:43:22] <boomstickery> RACIST
[1:43:22] <%Invlux> agreed
[1:43:22] <+terry_quest> lmao
[1:43:23] <VritraReiRei> It's also not TRUE Black and White
[1:43:23] <LoneFonte> It's white and grey
[1:43:24] <Khorneflakes_> Kinda the point with the audio
[1:43:24] <+Remery_> I like color
[1:43:25] <quesadiablo> agree
[1:43:25] <%FutaSnek> Not a good greyscale
[1:43:25] <%PettyFunk> Yeah it's all midtone
[1:43:25] <Kally_D> Contrast up pls
[1:43:26] <$ragingbrachy> why would you play THIS GAME in black and white
[1:43:26] <+JingKaisean> that's awesome
[1:43:26] <%Thewoodentree> clipped
[1:43:26] <Ner234> LUL
[1:43:27] <%dekkitout> And, soundbyte
[1:43:28] <%PipIV> C O N T R A S T
[1:43:28] <Lophostrix_> RACIST
[1:43:29] <+xeros720> like a vhs tape
[1:43:29] <bleugh> it would destroy your eyes
[1:43:29] <%ToneBacas> fight someone maybe the audio mixing makes sense
[1:43:29] <+JingKaisean> but it's not for you
[1:43:29] <+terry_quest> take that out of context
[1:43:30] <%spiritofmojave> clip that
[1:43:31] <Profmcstevie> It's not harsh enough
[1:43:31] <Ipsenscastle> Yeah there's not enough contrast
[1:43:34] <cosmicgoatee> but muh Kurosawaaa
[1:43:34] <%leinadtonu> mmmm
[1:43:34] <%bluefooddye1> You might want to rephrase that LUL
[1:43:35] <danknugglit> 'Second playthrough mode'
[1:43:37] <+StreamStopA> yes more segregation
[1:43:37] <RedoctoberWolf> woolieKICKDAD_TK
[1:43:39] <horse_disguised_as_horse> That's racist
[1:43:39] <$ragingbrachy> LOOK AT THEM COLOURS
[1:43:40] <+necrocannibal2> RACIST
[1:43:42] <+JingKaisean> oh shit that grainy film
[1:43:42] <+MidnightBurst12> hmmm
[1:43:45] <%ha2ken> @ WoolieWoolz
[1:43:45] <+Skelegroove> Contrast is underrated
[1:43:45] <%hax_metatron> Kurosawa did NOT APPLY a Black and White filter, he DESIGNED for Black and White. There's an art to B&W direction, that's not just, put a filter on it!!! LUL
[1:43:45] <%DetroitSentai> Kurasawa was way more intense
[1:43:46] <%Hegelundra> @PatStaresAt what if you change the contrast setting?
[1:43:46] <cosmicgoatee> lmao
[1:43:46] <%GingerStrawhat> I still appreciate it being there
[1:43:47] <+HotBloodedHero> They make the audio tinny to emulate old movies
[1:43:49] <twieetcha> Hmmm
[1:43:49] <Acti0njacks0n99> MORE CONTRAST
[1:43:50] <+brightman42> wait, so he did get a code?
[1:43:50] <HissingCats> more contrast
[1:43:50] <+akira_chong> @danknugglit This.
[1:43:51] <cobalt_phoenix_> @PettyFunk thanks
[1:43:51] <%PettyFunk> They need way more contrast because the scenes are shot for color
[1:43:52] <Profmcstevie> It's beautiful, never ever using it
[1:43:53] <Shwepie> It's just a grey filter with a garbage film grain thrown on top.....
[1:43:54] <%Spydurman> too bland
[1:43:54] <bleugh> huge contrast destroys the eyeballs though
[1:43:55] <%seycheles> D:
[1:43:56] <mesamus> yeah there's too much grey if you really want to have that old kurosawa vibe
[1:44:02] <+informedotaku> kurosawwa approved tho
[1:44:02] <$ragingbrachy> welp
[1:44:04] <%M4T1A5> I believe it tries to replicate the film stock kurosawa used, not neccesarily any artistic considerations
[1:44:05] <majima666> always like it when console games give you a choice of a better framerate for a bit of a graphical hit
[1:44:09] <megakruemel> nothing changed for us
[1:44:09] <KidKaiser23> @bleugh Fuck it
[1:44:11] <%valriot> SkillUp made the best point, the game is too pretty to put on Kurosawa mode
[1:44:12] <%FutaSnek> THE FAAADE
[1:44:12] <calamarvelous> This game is too scary for me there are so many scary ghosts of tsushima
[1:44:14] <%FutaSnek> MOENY
[1:44:19] <%LunarDensetsu> turn contrast up on blaCK AND WHITE woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH

[1:44:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I think you misread the mask input

[1:48:07] <%PettyFunk> Oh that might work!
[1:48:10] <+Loinclothiclese> eh
[1:48:12] <DesertPenguin> Not much darker
[1:48:12] <+Loinclothiclese> i dont like it
[1:48:15] <%Taisuru> Not enough
[1:48:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wow
[1:48:16] <%PettyFunk> Hey it's a bit better@
[1:48:16] <%Dakuu75> Kurasowa mode
[1:48:18] <%barrakuta371> A little better
[1:48:18] <Mr_Rakjo> Colour better
[1:48:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Seems better, but I prefer the color
[1:48:19] <%SoySocks> it's a bit better, but still not enough
[1:48:20] <%ToneBacas> psaBlind
[1:48:21] <DesertPenguin> It's cool but not proper Kurosawa
[1:48:22] <%PipIV> it's ok I guess
[1:48:22] <%clockworknate> lost almost 400 viewers with that pee break lol
[1:48:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> NOT ENOUGH CONTRAST
[1:48:24] <%LunarDensetsu> STILL NOT AS DARK
[1:48:24] <%mike2hands> i dont know
[1:48:25] <%Jekado> TURN IT TO 4:# pat
[1:48:25] <%LunarDensetsu> DARN
[1:48:25] <+BobBaudoin> I think it needs less bloom
[1:48:26] <CursedNobleman> ehhhhhh, color
[1:48:27] <%Maids4lyfe> Pat you're almost as blind as Paige
[1:48:28] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Maybe Higher brightness?
[1:48:30] <%PettyFunk> It's not perfect but that is WAY better than the first b&w look
[1:48:32] <+EySoyCoco> nah, black and white is only cool when intended
[1:48:32] <gsoto83> it looks nice, but yeah its not good
[1:48:34] <%Invlux> 90% of that gray should be black
[1:48:34] <Deathmemester> it needs to be a lot more black and white, so much grey
[1:48:34] <%Jekado> 4:3 mode!!!
[1:48:35] <%LunarDensetsu> WE TRIED
[1:48:37] <%CalderGaming> go watch a kurosawa film after this, paige. compare the contrast
[1:48:38] <%mike2hands> i mean its cool but i dont think it helps on the gameplay
[1:48:39] <myriad_truth> Gameboy color!!
[1:48:39] <%taku_toots> it snice but your right baout the audio
[1:48:42] <%Rumbutt> doesn't quite hit the level to live up to what the mode is named
[1:48:42] <%Maids4lyfe> the colour is pretty
[1:48:44] <+BobBaudoin> it needs darker colors and less bloom and I think it'd look fantastic
[1:48:45] <Khorneflakes_> That's for a second playthrough
[1:48:48] <%ToneBacas> you removed the track
[1:48:48] <jbrachob> is not interesting enough
[1:48:51] <%PipIV> the world is just moving slightly
[1:48:51] <VritraReiRei> It looks good, but that's not Kurosawa if there is any color EXCEPT Black and White
[1:48:51] <+EySoyCoco> photo mode crazies are going to do great with it tho
[1:48:58] <%YakumoYomi> I don't think the nailed the "Kurosawa" look
[1:49:01] <+BobBaudoin> but still, game looks CRAZY good
[1:49:01] <%hax_metatron> Go watch Kurosawa films !!! They're artistic in their use of Black and White. You can't just put a B&W Filter and call it Kurosawa Mode LUL
[1:49:03] <myriad_truth> SORA!!!

[2:07:34] <%spiritofmojave> easily
[2:07:35] <+Ether101_Prime> Jin's logic was that the rebels started a problem, which caused the bear to travel down to these lands which caused problem for them. So, his logic is that they should be punished that way.
[2:07:37] <%worldbrand> when we shoot, we shoot with our heart

[2:08:03] <%Agami23> are samurai and knights basically the same thing?
[2:08:04] <%PaladinDupre> And knights had to be chivalrous XD
[2:08:04] <%spiritofmojave> this looks like propaganda/revisionism
[2:08:04] <%Dakuu75> that's a RONIN not a Samurai\
[2:08:05] <jbrachob> It did pat
[2:08:05] <%dinnydanny777> Pat it existed, they just didn't FOLLOW IT

[2:08:08] <+Over_ninek> sure it did, in the movies
[2:08:08] <%xmetalicdemonx> Yeah samurai were dicks
[2:08:08] <+JingKaisean> imperialist japan made it up
[2:08:09] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Remember it's based on the romanticized version of Kurosawa samurai movies, which would later go on to influence the Jedi
[2:08:09] <%DetroitSentai> It was revisionist history
[2:08:10] <thesanderdc> They still talked about it
[2:08:10] <%PipIV> WHY TAKE THE WORD OF PEASANTS?
[2:08:10] <%bluefooddye1> They literally killed peasants just to test out their new swords
[2:08:11] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Just like Knights

[2:08:17] <Khorneflakes_> Now to go back to the present, where we are super cowards.
[2:08:17] <%Agami23> where they are all cool in fiction but they are basically just asshole mercs?
[2:08:17] <%dinnydanny777> It's literally the same as the Chivalric code dumbass
[2:08:19] <+Remery_> not everyone was a scumbag
[2:08:19] <Profmcstevie> They sold themselves as reputable men, as the modern man would
[2:08:19] <Ipsenscastle> Like the Police Union

[2:09:54] <+StreamStopA> that horse don't give a fuck
[2:09:55] <stabbityrabbit> Musashi is one of the most famous samurai ever and he was a scumlord. Either showing up hours early to a duel, or never showing at all. Bushido was a case by case basis.
[2:09:56] <%bigboyeggo> yeah samurai and knights were basically a thing of "do as i say, not as i do"
[2:09:58] <$ragingbrachy> kill you

[2:10:40] <gsoto83> Samurai were the same as knights and knights just went around and were like "I let you live, give me all your money or let me fuck your wife. BIG LIES J/K I'm gonna do both and maybe kill you probably"

[2:10:50] <nw_kero> @BeezusHrist that's just a lame way to say confucian values. Absolute loyalty to those above you was the value to keep an ordered society
[2:10:51] <DesertPenguin> Anything cool happen in the last 10 minutes?
[2:10:52] <+Toblo1> It weirdly feels more splorchy than in TLOU2, though I guess the feeling is uh... different?
[2:10:52] <%walternatorz> the foley effects guy is cheering right now
[2:10:54] <%NopeBadguy> This foley sounds like someone went into a butchery to record all this
[2:10:54] <%taku_toots> maybe mongolian necks are wetter

[2:11:08] <+Remery_> I hope i don't die from a sneak attack.
[2:11:16] <KingHyperbole> i wonder how many times they had to stab someone to get those noises just right
[2:11:20] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> i like how people made a big deal how dying people in tlou2 gurgle but it's just the same in this game
[2:11:21] <+akira_chong> @BeezusHrist I feel like that's an overestimation of US police. The thing we seem to be seeing is that they exist for no other reason than to protect THEIR OWN power.
[2:11:21] <+StreamStopA> I'M FREEEEEEEEEE! THANK YOU SNEAKING SAMURI!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:11:23] <BleedinActionMan> @DesertPenguin Jin stabbed a dude in the back like a coward for the first time

[2:11:46] <%Invlux> Ah, good ol Straw Hat
[2:11:48] <%Sasquatch_John> Sasquatch_John subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Sup Pat, being essential sucks, especially when you work at a gas station in the city and get to see just how stupid the average person can be on a daily basis...
[2:11:54] <+Remery_> @GeneralSCPatton that was not a honorable way to go :(
[2:11:55] <Profmcstevie> Give me your straw hat, I need more Def nairoEyes
[2:11:56] <diego_andres> LOOT

[2:12:16] <+rei0> all of these honor stealing
[2:12:20] <smallboops> that would be cool
[2:12:20] <%Cavumentum> NOW you're acting like a real Samurai
[2:12:21] <%bigboyeggo> if someone's gonna kill me then i just want them to shoot me directly in the back of the head with a shotgun
[2:12:21] <diego_andres> FORGOT A CHEST
[2:12:22] <+Remery_> @NopeBadguy But how will I explain it to God?
[2:12:23] <%Midashu> the most honorable path is to kill them and take all their loot
[2:12:26] <%Cavumentum> Stealing from these foreigners
[2:12:27] <%Invlux> Wow cool collectathon PogChamp

[2:12:39] <%possumwalsh1221> I will steal your supplies for honor
[2:12:41] <%sleepers1mulant> inari shrines?
[2:12:44] <$ragingbrachy> 🦊
[2:12:44] <nw_kero> samurai weren't nice or whatever in war they did what they had to in order to win. The honor comes from loyalty and abiding by confucian values. these aren't contradictory
[2:12:49] <+MegaCorpltd> nice of them all to stare at the walls
[2:12:53] <%NopeBadguy> He'll know
[2:12:58] <+froduck42> Taffy?

[2:13:37] <%Robot_Nixon_> Where's the historically accurate game utilizing the ultimate weapon S P E A R
[2:13:38] <%dinnydanny777> My best example of "Chivalric code" or noblility honour codes being bullshit is that Richard the Lionheart murdered thousands of innocent people during the Crusades and he's thought of as having been a good and noble king and a great warrior because of it
[2:13:38] <%DashXero> Gomu gomu....
[2:13:39] <Ipsenscastle> bushido was Christian values ascribed to them by a Christian weeb in the 1900s, it's complete bullshit

[2:14:15] <@SoFarFetched> probably same pathing
[2:14:16] <%Robot_Nixon_> theyre friends :)
[2:14:16] <%spiritofmojave> I super doubt that
[2:14:16] <+Dorf1> no thats right
[2:14:18] <+EySoyCoco> not enough crunch
[2:14:19] <$ragingbrachy> so they cant get sneak killed
[2:14:19] <+JingKaisean> uh that sounds wrong
[2:14:21] <%weissguard> He REAAALY wants to get in there.
[2:14:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> VERY DOUBT woolieONEGUY
[2:14:21] <huskarl_zap> They're on the look out for caca

[2:14:23] <+Remery_> wasnt 6 feet rule back then
[2:14:24] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt They didn't have social distancing back then
[2:14:25] <%clockworknate> BFFs forever!
[2:14:26] <ProfessorLuigi> That sounds like rubbish
[2:14:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Because thats what suckerpunch does
[2:14:28] <%R3Roundabout> Sure it was psa1guy
[2:14:29] <myriad_truth> I mean, 13th warrior was a thing
[2:14:30] <+akira_chong> It was Meiji propaganda, not Christian. What even the hell?
[2:14:30] <%Maids4lyfe> christian wtf
[2:14:30] <%bluefooddye1> personal space didn't exist until the 19th century
[2:14:31] <%Cavumentum> One Guy As Fuck
[2:14:32] <bleugh> jesus was the first samurai
[2:14:35] <%dukenux> Source: dude, trust me
[2:14:35] <+necrocannibal2> ninjutsu also never existed
[2:14:35] <%Clumbonius_Fudgeborne> A very quick wiki search reveals that was false
[2:14:36] <cheerfulnpc> That is not true at all. Bushido was created in the 17th century.
[2:14:36] <%count_bob> 3
[2:14:37] <Andrizzleton> that one guy was actually talking about BULLshido
[2:14:37] <stabbityrabbit> @nw_kero I think that's a big part of it too. A lot of moral dissonance between the morals of the time and what we have now. You can see the same thing happen with the romanticization of greek heroes and myth.
[2:14:39] <+JingKaisean> that sounds like someone paid money to lie
[2:14:50] <omen_setter> bushido sorta existed but no one called it bushido until the 19th century. it's not christian
[2:14:54] <%Maids4lyfe> japan hates christianity (back then)
[2:14:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Markiplier: WHERE'S THE BLACKSMITH?!
[2:15:00] <%dukenux> Jesus had a beard and mustache, like a samurai
[2:15:03] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah cause jin got his ass beaten LUL
[2:15:04] <nw_kero> @PatStaresAt The mongols eat weird food like that bc they are nomads and their home country can't grow crops. All their traditional foods are dairy and meat based
[2:15:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> The modern perception of bushido comes from books that mixed it with european chivalry, which itself was a romanticized version of what actually occurred.
[2:15:10] <%dukenux> also wore kimono and sandals
[2:15:10] <cheerfulnpc> Bushido was created during a time of peace in order to give the no longer needed samurai purpose
[2:15:12] <%PettyFunk> How about a super cool mask
[2:15:14] <OvaltineDream> I remember when jesus was hired to fight the ainu]
[2:15:14] <huskarl_zap> PURPLE GUY?!
[2:15:14] <%Invlux> Yakuza 0 cutscene shit
[2:15:15] <%Blargimazombie> NO HE CANT
[2:15:18] <MrIntake> Just nuke the mongols 4Head
[2:15:20] <%toastybites> @necrocannibal2 ninjutsu actually did exist, but not the modern perception of it
[2:15:20] <+akira_chong> @PatStaresAt It was Meiji propaganda in the late 1800s, not Christian propaganda in the 1900s.
[2:15:20] <SumKnowBuddy> who cares? theyre all dead now anyway. doesnt matter if its real. its cool.
[2:15:23] <MrDonTacos_> cowards
[2:15:41] <gsoto83> @dukenux I see what your putting down, Jesus was original samurai
[2:15:42] <%NovaKnightmare> where does Mongolian BBQ come from?
[2:15:43] <%spiritofmojave> Steppe food ye
[2:15:43] <DesertPenguin> Same difference
[2:15:44] <+gaemjurnalist> TSUSHIMA IS A PEOPLE NOT A PLACE
[2:15:46] <+akira_chong> @PatStaresAt Yeah

[2:15:57] <%dinnydanny777> How strange that chat seem to be saying wildly conflicting things every five minutes

[2:15:58] <@commanderclaw> In other words, psaBig Romanticism
[2:16:01] <+JingKaisean> yes that's correct
[2:16:01] <reonome> UNF
[2:16:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> The mongols were also fans of just eating a block of cheese.
[2:16:02] <%Robot_Nixon_> Just saw this clip of a guy ice fishing, then walking to the DESERT to cook the fish. Mongolia is harsh

[2:16:06] <+frogurtz> What is this Star Wars shit?
[2:16:06] <+xddddsorandom> that's new
[2:16:07] <+Semiconductive> is this a video game or just an anthropology study
[2:16:08] <%Daniel_Is_I> Point is samurai are just glorified mercenaries

[2:17:03] <kratosdestroys> He seems like a chill dude
[2:17:04] <%floralkami> HE WANTS HIM TO SURRENDER

[2:19:54] <+yoshkosh20> moon stance better involve showing your butt
[2:19:55] <BritishTyrannosaur> I like this it's simple but complex enough
[2:19:55] <%BeezusHrist> And this is the problem with doing period pieces like this, their full of bullshit. Both the Mongols and the previous power structures were bad. That's why I liked Sekiro. The game didn't pretend like any of the people in it were good. Everyone was a piece of shit
[2:19:59] <+gaemjurnalist> we L5R 5e now

[2:21:03] <+Remery_> Pet the fox
[2:21:03] <+akira_chong> Like this is totally bullshit historically, I get that, @BeezusHrist. The thing is that if you accept that and treat it as fantasy, it's fun.

[2:21:44] <%BeezusHrist> @xddddsorandom Yes, and that was my point. THIS is NOT a historical game either, but it plays fast and loose with problematic elements of Japanese history like Samurai's relationship with the local populace

[2:25:33] <%BeezusHrist> @SumKnowBuddy Because if we are going to do a game or movie or anything in media based off of history, we should make sure it is as accurate as possible. Not doing that misleads people. Hollywood fiction has become FACT. There are a bunch of examples of this LUL

[2:52:58] <%TheMattman1313> Cuz the Mongols also used rocket launchers
[2:52:59] <%srkAres> i think eyes are still pretty important for archery
[2:53:00] <+MrProw> im pretty sure it relies on eys
[2:53:01] <+IrishWeegee> so is the combat closer to batman arkham or dark souls or...?

[3:06:12] <%superc37> @lobotomized_teddy_bear the base combat and flow of this game is still roughly similar to something like nioh or sekiro. its clear they drew some inspiration, but not enough to actually make it good since they were still aiming for realism.
[3:06:13] <%Zombrocom> She is a secret mongol!

[3:08:46] <DesertPenguin> Cultural appropriation
[3:08:46] <Morbidmort> Did he try to rape her?
[3:08:47] <%dinnydanny777> This film has this campy vibe, it's almost like it's based on old Samurai films which ALSO HAD A CAMPY CHARM

[3:09:35] <%hax_metatron> "She taught them how to aim a bow!" " WHAT A TRAITOR! NO WAY THEY COULD KNOW HOW TO DO THAT!"
[3:09:36] <%baronblank> plot twist, it's the tomoe from sekiro and she has crazy lightning powers
[3:09:38] <%warmnoid> can't believe mami tomoe would arm the mongols with muskets
[3:09:38] <Khorneflakes_> They learned the bow ON horse back
[3:09:39] <+AriaMeloetta> Tomoe is a servant in fate

[3:26:33] <%twoto858> Clipping through trees
[3:26:34] <+IrishWeegee> Is a yurt a type of tent or shed?
[3:26:36] <HellishLancer> it might be in the camp
[3:26:38] <%dukenux> UHAA
[3:26:40] <%count_bob> Actually observing a Leader is simple. Remaining hidden from your enemies for long enough to initiate the observing ritual is the difficult part. You need to try and not alert the enemy while in the enemy base.
[3:26:40] <%dinnydanny777> I swear he just went HOO HAA
[3:26:41] <%DappercatEsquire> just do it bro

[3:27:49] <%M3djedx> man the combat
[3:27:53] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Do you have to time it right to kill them in a standoff, or is it automatic?

[3:28:09] <taquito_blade> oh wow, that's so smoothe ass combat. I'm anxious now
[3:28:17] <Zebroneath> The way the UI fades away is really neat
[3:28:18] <+gaemjurnalist> use your speshul eyes
[3:28:22] <megakruemel> there is suffering to end behind you on the floor pat
[3:28:24] <+IrishWeegee> maybe aim the bow at them?
[3:28:25] <SpaceGuntank> dont forget to end their suffering.
[3:28:29] <%king_wragles> @BleedinActionMan you let go right when they move to hit you I believe
[3:28:29] <%DappercatEsquire> Maybe it's a later mechanical thing?
[3:28:31] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why the hell did you just Announce you were there?
[3:28:35] <taquito_blade> is there Quickdraw attacks?
[3:28:41] <%DukeMoose> maybe you havent "unlocked" observation yet?

[3:28:59] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> PAT FINISH THAT GUY
[3:29:00] <Ipsenscastle> This UI is really slick but it doesn't feel particularly married to the theme
[3:29:00] <%indig0bird> You need Kenbonshoku Haki
[3:29:02] <%ToneBacas> Pat the coward fights with honor
[3:29:06] <%BeezusHrist> @PettyFunk And sicking a Stormbird on a thunderjaw will never get old either
[3:29:12] <%count_bob> Approach in stealth and use your focused hearing to look for an NPC performing combat swings, even when nobody else is around. That'll be the captain practicing. Approach them in secret and in stealth, because they'll stop training if they're alerted to your presence in any way. When within about thirty meters, there'll be an icon above their head pushing you to hold R2. Hold it down uninterrupted for about five seconds and you'll get a slot of progress.
[3:29:17] <+Mleahy24> this game have fall damage?

[3:31:33] <%dukenux> Samurai's Creed
[3:31:33] <%mike2hands> Its baby time
[3:31:36] <SpaceGuntank> little bit of farcy, little bit of sekiro
[3:31:37] <%DappercatEsquire> Combat looks pretty deliberate
[3:31:41] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> I forgot this game has grapple mechanics too!
[3:31:43] <%indig0bird> @Nejums With how those games work nowadays, I'm honestly okay with this approach
[3:31:44] <$ragingbrachy> poof!
[3:31:44] <%M3djedx> psaBougie
[3:31:44] <DesertPenguin> Assassin's Nioh: Arkham Sekiro
[3:31:44] <%SharKinStereo> what is flash?
[3:31:45] <quesadiablo> is it atleast tighter than batman?
[3:31:46] <Ipsenscastle> it's mostly staying out of its own way so far
[3:31:49] <%Afterman_> what
[3:31:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> yeah
[3:31:51] <%srkAres> yeah because The Flash sucks
[3:31:51] <%Afterman_> what happened
[3:31:51] <%Invlux> Did Nioh get preggers by Batman, or did Batman get knocked up by Nioh
[3:31:52] <%luftraumm1> no infinite loot and grinding
[3:32:04] <DesertPenguin> The Flash CW TV show sucks
[3:32:07] <DesertPenguin> The character is awesome
[3:32:07] <%michingmallecho> The map looks big
[3:32:11] <Nomenanza> Yeah, personally aside from aesthetic, this game doesn't look that different from your ACs, Batmans, and Horizons
[3:32:11] <%C0baltCrusade> @PatStaresAt DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO CLIMB A TOWER FOR THAT
[3:32:13] <SomeAsianDood> that anim was slick
[3:32:16] <%luftraumm1> straight forward gabe's are hard to come by these days
[3:32:18] <Don_Discovery> liberate the dojo to show you have the strongest back in all of japan
[3:32:20] <%Shubreaker> nioh's got them child bearing hips
[3:32:22] <%coreyyotto> Isn't that kind of the end goal though?
[3:32:25] <%PaladinDupre> the far cry problem
[3:32:27] <%srkAres> @PatStaresAt does the direction of the rain change with the direction of the wind?
[3:32:27] <%M3djedx> THUNDER HORSE
[3:32:28] <%dinnydanny777> I LOVE HOW HE TALKS TO HIS HORSE
[3:32:33] <%luftraumm1> animations are slick
[3:32:39] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt That would mean you single handedly defeated the Mongolian army
[3:32:40] <%DappercatEsquire> I'm getting kinda sold on this, but I know won't have time for this type of open world game
[3:32:41] <%dinnydanny777> Jin loves his horse
[3:32:47] <DesertPenguin> lol
[3:32:49] <poppybros21> it reminds me of the witcher
[3:32:52] <OldManDeckardCain> KAYBLADE
[3:32:54] <%luftraumm1> horse doesn't seem to happy to gallop that hard
[3:32:56] <%Afterman_> kill them all pat
[3:32:56] <%spiritofmojave> If you don't talk to your horse, it's weirder somehow
[3:32:56] <%weissguard> Nah, not yet. LUL Kappa
[3:32:59] <%shiplord13> No Sora don't look for Riku
[3:33:01] <elicoy> From a visual combat perspective it's reminding me of Shadow of Mordor

[3:33:01] <%M3djedx> sucha slick game
[3:33:04] <+MoonObscure> hes horse dick right?
[3:33:05] <%dinnydanny777> "We'll get through this" - Jin, to his horse

[3:33:20] <$ragingbrachy> huh. he really didnt see shit i guess
[3:33:20] <%SolidusRex> Sora wasn't a keyblade master though
[3:33:22] <%PaladinDupre> Big Far Cry Energy
[3:33:24] <%Totally_not_toby> if he's a keyblade master then he's already better than real sora

[3:33:47] <%M3djedx> psaDab psaDab
[3:33:47] <Nomenanza> Were there any difficulty options when you first launched it? I wonder if this game allows to tweak certain aspects like stealth.
[3:33:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh my God, my dumb dog is eating birdseed off the ground
[3:33:50] <$ragingbrachy> thank you to that person reminding me to drink water
[3:33:53] <%dukenux> they really should've clean up that tree
[3:33:55] <megakruemel> I wonder if we can look back at this in 20 years and still be like "Wow so pretty!"
[3:33:56] <DesertPenguin> Anyone else have a kitty sitting near them?
[3:33:57] <elicoy> I wish i had 4k :(

[3:34:17] <zenith0111> Holy shit i forgot this game existed. When did this come out?
[3:34:18] <%dinnydanny777> The jump looks really good
[3:34:21] <%Afterman_> tip
[3:34:23] <%Invlux> @GeneralSCPatton Tell your dog I love them
[3:34:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> Didn't they hate Christianity around this time?
[3:34:25] <theshillman> shouldn't have been on guard, now you have to kill him

[3:34:41] <%luftraumm1> clearing camps in stealth is so satisfying
[3:34:42] <myriad_truth> You're not Batman, PAT!
[3:34:43] <%FluffiTamamo> Nailed it
[3:34:44] <+Kenzo2000> Christ Jesus-san
[3:34:48] <%rdark_ksu> gravity did indeed exist in feudal Japan
[3:34:50] <%Totally_not_toby> "have you heard of our lord and savior jesus christ? no? well would you like to meet him?"
[3:34:54] <%Afterman_> i hear stealth is op af
[3:34:54] <zenith0111> So is this just Japanese Assassins Creed?
[3:34:55] <Lionkevinson> Does the game have Japanese voices?
[3:34:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> @desertpenguin She just ate, but is a beagle and therefore eternally hungry.
[3:35:03] <%Fien111> So apparently Tsushima island has its own species of leopard cat and it is a FAT BOI

[3:35:41] <Lionkevinson> @dukenux Thanks
[3:35:43] <%michingmallecho> What’s it called
[3:35:45] <%rdark_ksu> @PatStaresAt Don't worry that guy died of natural causes. As one naturally dies from a sword to the chest.
[3:35:45] <Shwepie> @megakruemel Probably but the biggest complaint would likely be that it looks fake or stiff. Lighting, fluidity are the big frontiers in graphics right now.
[3:35:46] <+xaveragecat> im so sad this isn't coming to pc
[3:35:54] <zenith0111> These feels like a Ubisoft game

[3:36:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Doubt he'll make it.
[3:36:03] <%Afterman_> @rdark_ksu swords are made from nature
[3:36:09] <DesertPenguin> @GeneralSCPatton we put out shelled peanuts and the crows take them away in their mouths
[3:36:13] <+Dayube> some say kaytana others chitana
[3:36:14] <RazYamiyo> its too well made to be from ubisoft
[3:36:17] <haitakaa> is that Marco Polo
[3:36:18] <%luftraumm1> ubisoft but good
[3:36:21] <myriad_truth> A sword is made from natural elements..
[3:36:22] <RamenRiderZ> Ubisoft wishes their games were like this
[3:36:22] <jonesybot_5000> bat ronin
[3:36:23] <SomeAsianDood> Gluck with that khotun
[3:36:23] <%Fien111> Yeah, the Mongols were always doomed to failure with it. The Tsunami just gave them the excuse to give up

[3:36:25] <LeBlanc233> just invade all of japan 4Head

[3:48:16] <+cvp5127> boo no fire

[3:49:23] <%ToneBacas> Jin for Dead by Daylight LUL
[3:49:24] <megakruemel> Samurai actually used bows and spears in combat and the katanas were more a status symbol afaik
[3:49:26] <%dinnydanny777> @pettyfunk They used both but they mainly used bows and spears I think
[3:49:28] <alexandrecau> of course it is
[3:49:29] <%SGrim> @floralkami the shield extends the reach of your fist by about a foot. And usually wouldn't be much heavier than 5 pounds. Easy fist weapon.
[3:49:29] <MoonShapedPuddle> it is a more relaxed stance
[3:49:30] <BritishTyrannosaur> water, fire, swordmaster, gunslinger
[3:49:30] <%mike2hands> its like a kendo stand
[3:49:32] <%CokeMilkRequiem> is changing stances like changing styles in Yakuza?
[3:49:36] <zenith0111> @futasnek Will he finally swing his sword like a actual Samurai or just keep having these horribly telegraphed attacks?
[3:49:36] <%FutaSnek> RAISE YOUR WEAPON TO ASSERT DOMINANCE
[3:49:37] <Ipsenscastle> that's the stance you use when you want to slap someone with a big fish
[3:49:37] <BritishTyrannosaur> guntricksword
[3:49:39] <%Fien111> @DianaTheAscian they're highly specialized, like pretty much all swords. And like all swords were back-up weapons at most. Samurai primarily used bows and spears from horseback
[3:49:41] <SpaceGuntank> its like a grandma coming at you with a rolling pin kind a look
[3:49:41] <jonesybot_5000> lol
[3:49:43] <%floralkami> @patstaresat imagine having different techniques
[3:49:44] <+gaemjurnalist> the yeehaw stance
[3:49:49] <%Cavumentum> remember kids, Swords are Side Arms
[3:49:50] <RazYamiyo> yush
[3:49:54] <jonesybot_5000> so natural
[3:49:55] <alexandrecau> more style changing in nioh
[3:49:57] <ChungusQuest> I played a samurai in D&D once, and in my expert opinion, their preferred weapon is the daikyu greatbow
[3:50:04] <zhenthrim321> Spears and bow were the main weapons of the samurai
[3:50:08] <OvercastKnot> psaDab
[3:50:10] <zenith0111> Spears & Bows > Every other weapon
[3:50:10] <DesertPenguin> Swords are side arms for Europeans
[3:50:10] <%SharKinStereo> in the end: just hate all enemy types tho
[3:50:12] <BleedinActionMan> Oh, that's really good

[3:50:46] <%PettyFunk> Do you learn the technique to look really juicy and appealing to the enemy?
[3:50:47] <%ToneBacas> just longer stand-off streak, it's fine
[3:50:48] <%FutaSnek> @zenith0111 What you dont wind back 2 feet every time you swing something? LUL I thought that was just the way to do it (obvious sarcasm) but real talk if they where accurately fast it would be stupid hard to play

[3:55:50] <Randomfaux> @dinnydanny777 I 2nd this, do the fox thing
[3:55:55] <%dinnydanny777> I thought swords were supposed to bend because flexibility reduces the likelihood that they would break
[3:55:56] <+yoshkosh20> I love cats. almost as much as I love dogs.
[3:55:57] <BritishTyrannosaur> cliche is another word for tried and true tbh

[3:56:02] <zenith0111> @dinnydanny777 Every sword has to have flexibility

[3:56:06] <%Fien111> @dinnydanny777 The spine can bend but the edge is brittle
[3:56:09] <%FutaSnek> @dinnydanny777 Most swords are to a degree, too hard and it'll snap when it hits something

[4:02:04] <+zinris> WERENT YOU A SWIMMER??
[4:02:04] <%dinnydanny777> There's a myth about Horse's being scared of streams
[4:02:04] <%PettyFunk> Horses are actually really strong swimmers aren;t they?
[4:02:05] <Sternieliscious> You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him sink.
[4:02:05] <SomeAsianDood> no
[4:02:06] <zenith0111> BETTER THAN ASSASSIN'S CREED EH?

[4:02:09] <Drunkengen> Paige can run but no swim?
[4:02:10] <$floralkami> @subjecttea the only person who is gonna give you a proper, objective answer would be the one playing it. otherwise, you should be able to watch it and judge for yourself like everyone else.
[4:02:11] <Brother_Coduss> @PatStaresAt Does she not know how fast horses are?
[4:02:13] <%BubbaRands> Anyone can outrun a horse Kappa
[4:02:16] <%dinnydanny777> Horse's are scared of running water, according to a myth
[4:02:19] <%PaladinDupre> if Paige breaks a leg do you have to, ya know?
[4:02:19] <%Fien111> Paige would make it 20 feet before all the bones in her legs were reduced to powder
[4:02:20] <%Garthunox> paige didnt you fall earlier today?
[4:02:23] <%spiritofmojave> Paige is an olympic swimmer I can't believe
[4:02:23] <%indig0bird> Maybe the Ghost of Tsushima was the horses that we made along the wat{
[4:02:23] <+Remery_> find more fox girls
[4:02:27] <%PettyFunk> How fast can a HORSE swim if it thinks the Loch Ness monster is behind it?

[4:02:29] <Ipsenscastle> This is the neutral zone

[4:02:42] <theshillman> to be fair, horses are afraid of everything
[4:02:42] <+zinris> paige did competitive swimming so im confident she can swim faster than a horse
[4:02:50] <Profmcstevie> Paige the bones in your body powered by McDonalds would collapse in a sharp breeze, you'd have to sabotage a horse
[4:02:52] <@commanderclaw> I feel bad for horses, they make them swim during water polo

[4:09:49] <+InsaneJackLondon> SAVE THE BOOZE
[4:09:52] <%chubbypencil> This game seems great for people who aren't games reviewers and havent been forced into playing literally every open world game of the last 7 years
[4:09:53] <%dinnydanny777> NOT THE RICE WINE
[4:09:55] <%sleepers1mulant> SAVE THE SAKE
[4:09:56] <Profmcstevie> Take my wife but NOT MY BREWSKI BROTHER
[4:09:56] <myriad_truth> Always save the booze!
[4:09:58] <%spiritofmojave> BURN MY KIDS BUT NOT THE BOOZE 😡
[4:09:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I really really hate the gear system in Horizon, I don't want to see any more of that crap around.
[4:09:59] <%logoth_> This looks like an open world game alright
[4:09:59] <$floralkami> main story
[4:09:59] <%Shockrates20XX> that's racist
[4:10:00] <%C0baltCrusade> The Mongols wont be able to steal all your booze if you drink ALL the booze before they can get there
[4:10:00] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> SAKE IS FUCKING INCREDIE
[4:10:01] <@SoFarFetched> yellow seems to be main
[4:10:03] <%Agami23> it says on the top of the marker
[4:10:04] <%count_bob> Yes
[4:10:05] <ha2ken> Save booze for the future
[4:10:06] <%Shubreaker> new quests are yellow
[4:10:06] <%Fien111> Where's the (rice) rum?!
[4:10:08] <%marsantas> Unlock vs continuing
[4:10:09] <%twistedj3ster> not our Bambooze!
[4:10:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @chubbypencil oh god, I'm gonna hate this, then
[4:10:15] <BoneofMalkav> "The Power of Hulkamania allowed me to body slam Andre the Giant.... at the expense of my back muscles and spinal cord."
[4:10:16] <myriad_truth> Get that dragon wine!
[4:10:20] <+Remery_> Sake is made from rice right?
[4:10:22] <ZAC415> ultimate BOOZE run
[4:10:23] <%Agami23> when you hover over it, it says what the questline is for different colors
[4:10:25] <heartlesshealer> Yellow = Tales of Jin White = Tales of Tsushima
[4:10:26] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> Gold is main quest yes
[4:10:27] <%Not_Dutch_> why would Mongolians want booze when they have fermented yak's milk?
[4:10:31] <Scrub_Seeker> hows the game so far?
[4:10:32] <heartlesshealer> it's on the hover window
[4:10:34] <CursedNobleman> ...
[4:10:35] <%AncelDeLambert> forced climb points, yep, I'm out
[4:10:37] <%feMC_is_best_girl> This game is mad gorgeous
[4:10:38] <%dinnydanny777> Sake is nice
[4:10:40] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @remery_ yes and it’s delicious
[4:10:42] <%Fien111> Sake kinda sucks, honestly, but I hate the taste of plain rice so I'm probably a bit bias. It's just kinda bland, though
[4:10:45] <%rdark_ksu> still the core crop
[4:10:46] <%BubbaRands> Sake = Rice Wine
[4:10:50] <heartlesshealer> let it rot and find out
[4:10:54] <danielm427> hot sake is great
[4:10:56] <%dinnydanny777> Sake is pretty sweet
[4:10:56] <+ConAirOnDVD> okay but sake is delicious
[4:10:56] <myriad_truth> Rice is used for everything!!
[4:11:00] <%srkAres> you can turn anything into booze if youre angry enough
[4:11:01] <%BubbaRands> Just like Russians with Potatoes
[4:11:02] <%count_bob> Can we turn this into booze? Why we created cities.
[4:11:02] <SubjectX07x> Yuh pretty much
[4:11:02] <SpaceGuntank> ah Rice, the Potato of the East.
[4:11:03] <ha2ken> Took the words right outta my mouth Pat
[4:11:03] <%dukenux> yes
[4:11:04] <KingHyperbole> You can make sake by chewing rice
[4:11:04] <%ssjklyco> Booze predates agriculture
[4:11:04] <%spiritofmojave> All of them
[4:11:06] <Lancaster_H> "we'll find a way to work this shit in"
[4:11:08] <ArcOfDeath> sounds about right
[4:11:11] <DesertPenguin> It's good warm
[4:11:14] <%sweenicus> food is cool, but what if it was tolerable poison
[4:11:15] <%sleepers1mulant> fucking love sake, i found a liquor store here that sells it in little cans
[4:11:15] <%chubbypencil> @AncelDeLambert last open world game I put time into was Mad Max. So I'm fresh and ready for open world collectathon
[4:11:16] <%mike2hands> we basically have catus booze
[4:11:17] <Profmcstevie> "I'll fucking try" said mankind
[4:11:18] <DesertPenguin> It's sakay not sakee?
[4:11:19] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> Korean Soju is also damn incredible.
[4:11:20] <%mike2hands> Cactus
[4:11:21] <%AncelDeLambert> not really, the best beer is pretty warm
[4:11:21] <ppararaj> Booze was safer to drink than water in the past
[4:11:22] <$valkuma> i like hot sake though
[4:11:23] <%DianaTheAscian> naming what cant be booze is easier than what can be
[4:11:24] <%srkAres> ouzo is also best at room temperature
[4:11:25] <%BubbaRands> I LOVE HOT SAKE
[4:11:27] <myriad_truth> It will get you toasted quick too
[4:11:28] <%Jekado> depends on the sake but yeah
[4:11:28] <%maenos2> my stepfather loves his piping hot
[4:11:29] <+jetjagger222> umeshu is better
[4:11:29] <%Jeemukun> sake good
[4:11:30] <%maenos2> for some reason
[4:11:31] <%PettyFunk> Honey wine is one of the oldest manmade alcohols, IIRC. I like some mead
[4:11:32] <%indig0bird> "Probably" - Humans
[4:11:33] <%rdark_ksu> warm sake always sounded nice
[4:11:33] <+abrupt_abe> @KingHyperbole They did that in Your Name
[4:11:33] <%Garthunox> you're insane paige, it's best when its hot, but not piping hoy
[4:11:33] <DesertPenguin> Thanks for the tip
[4:11:33] <%TheMattman1313> Eh I think it depends on the sake. Some sake is good cold or warm
[4:11:33] <%Midashu> room temperature? I heard body temperature
[4:11:34] <+StrawberryPantsu> So like any other Liquor?
[4:11:34] <%dinnydanny777> How come Sake, Beer, Ale, Wine, all that stuff lives on but fucking Mead is gone
[4:11:35] <$ragingbrachy> sake more like sucky
[4:11:35] <+ConAirOnDVD> some sake is better hot or chilled. you gotta check
[4:11:36] <+Sendrak70> Paige is wrong...the temp for it depends on the type.
[4:11:36] <Helmed> Every culture asked one question "will it turn into a weird worcester sauce or booze"
[4:11:36] <%Robot_Nixon_> ive never had hot sake, is it good?
[4:11:37] <ChungusQuest> Aren't there different varieties of sake with different ideal serving temperatures?
[4:11:40] <%indig0bird> Warm sake is really nice
[4:11:41] <+Remery_> want to try some one day
[4:11:46] <@SoFarFetched> umeshu is deliciious
[4:11:48] <%C0baltCrusade> Sake is also INSANELY easy to make at home
[4:11:48] <%Fien111> I had it room temperature and it was really bland. Maybe it was just bad sake or something. I'll have to try it again some time
[4:11:48] <%luftraumm1> I like hot sake
[4:11:49] <SnarkyDole> Umeshu Dento!
[4:11:50] <%logoth_> Does it make you shit
[4:11:50] <%Jekado> i agree umeshu is better
[4:11:53] <%Garthunox> Shochu is nice too
[4:11:53] <%mike2hands> tequila is cactus booze
[4:11:53] <KingHyperbole> @abrupt_abe That's where I first heard of it
[4:11:53] <myriad_truth> Drink that dragon juice!
[4:11:55] <%dinnydanny777> How come Mead died out while all the other old timey alcoholic beverages lived on
[4:11:56] <$valkuma> Eiswein is delicious
[4:11:57] <%indig0bird> Nah, warm sake is really good
[4:11:59] <zenith0111> @sendrak70 That's you being a contrarian LUL
[4:12:01] <%indig0bird> Umeshu is fantastic
[4:12:01] <%TheMattman1313> God damn Wieners
[4:12:03] <+warrenty13uk> yeah on my bucket list to have some sake
[4:12:04] <Ultimatefool> The I, Swine
[4:12:05] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> When I was in college all my friends were chinese and Japanese and we would MESSED UP on sake.
[4:12:05] <%Not_Dutch_> Again, mongolian's & fermented milk
[4:12:05] <+jetjagger222> umeshu goes with pizza oddly enough
[4:12:05] <$ragingbrachy> 4Head
[4:12:06] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> Wait isn't ice wine super poisoned?
[4:12:07] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[4:12:07] <%spiritofmojave> Ice wine
[4:12:07] <%rdark_ksu> how bout sochu?
[4:12:12] <%bigboyeggo> hinga dinga durgen
[4:12:14] <@commanderclaw> Eis Wine Drei
[4:12:14] <%barrakuta371> I prefer hot and cold sake, room temp is okay
[4:12:15] <%PettyFunk> @dinnydanny777 Mead is alive and well in the Pacific Northwest, it's simple to brew in smallish quantities
[4:12:17] <quesadiablo> mulled wine
[4:12:18] <%BubbaRands> ein zwei drei!
[4:12:19] <$ragingbrachy> grape wine fuckin sucks

[4:13:26] <%sleepers1mulant> cheap sake is great because im a fuckin heavyweight
[4:13:27] <%Jekado> because is generally easy to make since it requires rice and a fermenting agent
[4:13:28] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> Man if i could get drunk for that price I wouldn't be a functioning alcoholic
[4:13:28] <%Invlux> Everyone I know goes nuts over Asahi Superdry
[4:13:30] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Jao

[4:13:48] <GrimEnigma> beer is garbagw tier, rum is where its at
[4:13:52] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt Google says it's cause of the tax structure, which taxes beer more than hard liquor or wine

[4:14:09] <heartlesshealer> You kinda n e e d to get fucked up daily to deal with corporate life
[4:14:13] <+Skelegroove> Sake has more alcohol than other wines due to Japanese yeast being more resiliant
[4:14:13] <+I_Have_Vertigo> Honestly it's probably because everybody hates their lives so they just get shitfaced all the time, especially since mental illness isn't really acknowledged there

[4:23:34] <DesertPenguin> I love how Asia never had a Dark Ages like Europe. They just kept advancing and perpetuating their culture. How much changed from 1100 Japan to 1600 Japan? Probably not much and that's cool
[4:23:35] <%Fien111> Ah, the "sit back and pepper them with hundreds of arrows instead of getting stabbed" strategy. Very clever...
[4:23:35] <Ipsenscastle> very biting

[4:23:46] <Helmed> that dog had a name, dont you feel bad for killing it
[4:23:46] <%sleepers1mulant> one thing i wish this game had was the option to pull the camera back more
[4:23:48] <Monkeyweed21> Whens the flashback to the Mongols playing with that dog? @PatStaresAt
[4:23:48] <socratetris> @over_ninek probably. but if you have shield, its better to use a spear
[4:23:49] <BleedinActionMan> @Tucker0603 different stance
[4:23:49] <+jetjagger222> the tables have turned human
[4:23:50] <Ipsenscastle> such biting, very woof
[4:23:51] <%toolofparanoia> WAS THAT A CHOW CHOW?
[4:23:54] <+Smeagleman6> I keep hearing his name as Isekai
[4:23:56] <+CatsEyeBlind> That is one foofy pup
[4:24:00] <socratetris> probably always better tk have a spear than a sword
[4:24:01] <+MillerLowlife> floating sensei
[4:24:04] <1BeatGames> Ohhhh I see, Pat how is this so far?
[4:24:04] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> The stance would look cooler if he had a second sword

[4:24:22] <Ner234> LUL
[4:24:22] <Psyramics> @PatStaresAt Tomoe Gozen was a Japanese Samurai, and considered the first Japanese General after beheading the leader of an opposing clan

[4:24:38] <%mike2hands> you're a dickwad
[4:24:39] <%indig0bird> Okay, Tomoe was super justified
[4:24:39] <+Over_ninek> Jin's smack talk has leveled up, have this headband
[4:24:41] <myriad_truth> Tomoe is a real person???
[4:24:42] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @desertpenguin dark ages are not even a real thing. That was a myth created by renaissance thinkers.
[4:24:43] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[4:24:43] <BoneBagMel> Ishikawa kinda looks like pat... or is it just me?
[4:24:45] <%toolofparanoia> I swear that dog was a chow chow
[4:24:46] <Psyramics> that sucks in every game
[4:24:47] <FutaSnek> THe combat?
[4:24:47] <+it_was_too_long> true
[4:24:48] <%Fien111> "You have a very stab-able personality"
[4:24:48] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> YES
[4:24:49] <+KingOfTheGeats> yeah
[4:24:51] <Gieron667> so this
[4:24:54] <Ipsenscastle> especially if you're colourblind like me
[4:24:54] <%Deano8817> it's too good
[4:24:55] <BenLanBen> yes
[4:24:55] <Dr_Mooose> eh
[4:24:56] <%sleepers1mulant> yeah
[4:24:59] <DesertPenguin> Teddy Bear, so what was happening in Europ from 500-1500?
[4:24:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt dude, I put in a mod explicitly to get rid of Witcher Vision. And then it broke.
[4:25:00] <%spiritofmojave> And the combat was sorta eh
[4:25:04] <Psyramics> yes, Tomoe was a real person
[4:25:06] <sothatsprettybrutal> is that francois chau? it really really looks and sounds like francois chau
[4:25:07] <zenith0111> Whoa such a hot take Kappa no one has ever said that about Witcher Kappa
[4:25:08] <%trustycoyote> @toolofparanoia Yup. They originated from northern Chine.
[4:25:08] <ThDark> Lol I love how winded he sounds
[4:25:09] <+hotheadedmoron> why does this not have japanese voice actor?
[4:25:14] <KingHyperbole> how big is the whole map?
[4:25:15] <Monkeyweed21> you're in Japan
[4:25:17] <Gieron667> yea combat sucked too, just press one button
[4:25:23] <$floralkami> @lobotomized_teddy_bear is that not just the Middle ages?
[4:25:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Boomer
[4:25:31] <DSD24> @hotheadedmoron There is a Japanese voice optiom
[4:25:33] <$ragingbrachy> hes dying pat coneyWEIRDCHAMPION
[4:25:37] <+IrishWeegee> "Can you kill a dozen men?" "I dunno, I'll give it the ol' college try"
[4:25:38] <DesertPenguin> Dark Ages/Middle Ages/Medieval Times. Same shit
[4:25:39] <MadDesperado13> witcher combat was ass
[4:25:39] <@SoFarFetched> @hotheadedmoron he left it in english for those who just listen to the stream,because too many people would complain about it being in not english.
[4:25:44] <ppararaj> I think it is Francoise Chau
[4:25:46] <+jetjagger222> yeah the scabbard on that looks like a cheap tourist replica
[4:25:46] <%Paperware> ARROW'D
[4:25:48] <BleedinActionMan> @hotheadedmoron It does, Pat has it in English for the people who are just listening, and not watching
[4:25:50] <%spiritofmojave> he's still 60 in the 1200s or something like that
[4:25:51] <+hotheadedmoron> oh cool
[4:25:53] <+ConAirOnDVD> i'm not even old I'm just shitty
[4:25:56] <%AncelDeLambert> witcher combat was slow and annoying and then you add in that you can randomly come across an enemy five levels higher than you and you have why I hate open world games in general
[4:25:59] <$RealThiele> game character pat can relate to
[4:25:59] <zenith0111> ???????
[4:26:01] <%Typhaeon> Yes, it is François Chau
[4:26:02] <$ragingbrachy> youre in framerate mode
[4:26:04] <+hotheadedmoron> nevermind then
[4:26:09] <FutaSnek> DUDE YOUR RIGHT THERE
[4:26:09] <zenith0111> Pat's trying so hard to compliment this game LUL
[4:26:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Kappa500 They mentioned How writing Haiku Calms the mind and eases the soul yeh? Cool Story: When I was attending collage, driving gave me massive anxiety. One night driving home it was STORMING TO SHIT and pitch fuckin black! I decided it might calm me down to come up with some haikus on the spot and it totes helped me keep calm. It was like a Multi-Haiku kinda thing ABOUT violent storms, I committed it to paper when I got home. I liked it so much I also imortalized it on my Steam Profile page
[4:26:13] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @floralkami quite a lot of advancements happened during the Middle Ages. Quite a lot of advancements in writing and sciences
[4:26:15] <Tucker0603> that's fucked
[4:26:15] <FutaSnek> IN RANGE
[4:26:15] <DesertPenguin> This is the late 1100s I believe
[4:26:16] <+Jaysky> This game could learn a thing or two from Deadly Premonition 2
[4:26:16] <xtremegamer80> That's what Tomoe's about!
[4:26:17] <%rdark_ksu> age dont wait for shit
[4:26:18] <%feMC_is_best_girl> optimized for the pos4
[4:26:19] <%AncelDeLambert> was there even truly a POINT to having light and heavy attacks in Witcher 3?
[4:26:23] <%dukenux> Yeah, i'm breathing about as bad as him when i go running nowadays
[4:26:25] <%toolofparanoia> @trustycoyote They get big. And they're kind of aggressive.. Not the best with kids. They're like one person dogs i think

[4:26:34] <Dr_Mooose> well shit
[4:26:37] <%walternatorz> you've made friends
[4:26:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> How do you get XP if you don't practice on a living thing?
[4:26:42] <ThDark> I mean, didn't Samurai test their new swords by killing prisoners, or something to that effect?
[4:26:44] <%Shubreaker> i don't think this japanese women taught them how to murder other japanese
[4:26:46] <+Remery_> Arrows were super op back then :(
[4:26:51] <%toolofparanoia> Jealousy
[4:26:51] <%sleepers1mulant> good job pat psaUp

[4:26:56] <Ipsenscastle> Paige croak
[4:26:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @Brother_Coduss it's almost like video games aren't the real world and good level design crafts encounters
[4:26:59] <%rdark_ksu> by practicing on people they have less mouths to feed
[4:27:00] <Joustar_> OSFrog
[4:27:01] <%sleepers1mulant> ONE SHOT
[4:27:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> what a shit leader LUL

[4:27:09] <Helmed> OSFrog
[4:27:10] <%walternatorz> they failed to embrace the hulkamania
[4:27:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> END SUFFERING
[4:27:13] <+Remery_> frog girl
[4:27:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @zenith0111 I thought so. Certainly felt pointless.
[4:27:14] <%Fien111> Listen, Mongols did some SHIT and this is nothing. Like up the city of Merv. Most populated city in the world at the time....ALL DEAD
[4:27:16] <FutaSnek> LUL YEEYYEYEYEYE
[4:27:18] <%trustycoyote> @toolofparanoia Yeah. Makes sense why they are banned in some states in the US
[4:27:19] <RCIRainer> Desensitize yourself to shooting at people minimizes their chances of hesitating on the field - not that I expect they would hesitate much in the first place. Still fucked tho.
[4:27:20] <%spiritofmojave> KomodoHype

[4:28:04] <zhenthrim321> but she can be an ally tho says Jin
[4:28:08] <%BluBarracuda> She taking her man meat to have a hot, steamy soak.

[4:28:22] <nzrai> jin is desperate for manpower rn

[4:28:25] <%Maids4lyfe> maximize cinematics
[4:28:31] <Brother_Coduss> @AncelDeLambert you could put morton's out of business with all that salt you've got.
[4:28:31] <SnarkyDole> Could be worse. Could be Navi.
[4:28:31] <%feMC_is_best_girl> gotta put them grafics to use
[4:28:33] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[4:28:33] <+Take_2_shots> kinda early for the hot springs episode
[4:28:36] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> It’s an island too
[4:28:36] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, anybody want some pickles?
[4:28:51] <+StrawberryPantsu> I wish the rain was more dense
[4:28:55] <nzrai> he saw you rolling off those jumps!
[4:28:56] <+Over_ninek> more like you empowered a peasant to break free of her bonds

[4:29:07] <+Skelegroove> The sneaky attacks are the only reason anyone is still alive
[4:29:07] <%Shubreaker> ishikawa is a basic ass bitch
[4:29:11] <zenith0111> Wtf is this old man on about????
[4:29:15] <Shwepie> Pat does not have a big enough honor dick.

[4:29:20] <%Maids4lyfe> @AncelDeLambert pickling containers have to be burped or they'll explode from the gasses caused by yeast in the pickling/fermentation
[4:29:24] <zenith0111> We just saved a village and he's calling you a monster
[4:29:25] <+OwlLightningMage> NO HONOR
[4:29:31] <nw_kero> sub insults me and cries to a mod to get me timed out when I insult him back but it's ok
[4:29:35] <%DianaTheAscian> is this about star wars?
[4:29:35] <BleedinActionMan> I wonder if he would've said that if you hadn't been steaslth killing them
[4:29:38] <+theodolitejones> Whenever I teach people cool shit they become jerks!
[4:29:42] <zenith0111> Fuck off old man LUL
[4:29:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @Maids4lyfe huh...
[4:29:46] <%Fien111> Samurai learned Judo for fighting without weapons. Old Judo is basically Japanese Krav Maga
[4:29:46] <RazYamiyo> which is more than i can say about TLOU2
[4:29:46] <+Loinclothiclese> @zenith0111 i mean jin does some dope ass cold ass shit tbh
[4:29:48] <%rdark_ksu> aka never ever adapt. bullshit
[4:29:51] <@SoFarFetched> @zenith0111 cause jin is fighting without HONOR
[4:29:54] <%trustycoyote> @toolofparanoia Unfortunately pit bulls get banned as well even though they are wonderful family dogs with a bad rap
[4:29:55] <Samhotdamn> this is a good game
[4:29:57] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[4:29:59] <%Fien111> Samurai would stab you in the fucking dick if given half the chance
[4:30:09] <%Cavumentum> This seems like one of those "disappear for two weeks" games huh
[4:30:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Ooooooo
[4:30:14] <$ragingbrachy> get the ronin attire
[4:30:19] <$Caped_Eggy> Is this the whole world?
[4:30:19] <%AncelDeLambert> is Legend like your character level?

[4:30:24] <zenith0111> @sofarfetched By...? LUL
[4:30:27] <+OwlLightningMage> Better game than Last of Us 2
[4:30:27] <+Remery_> Kenshin outfit
[4:30:28] <%Maids4lyfe> every pit bull I've seen has been a big cuddly baby
[4:30:30] <%Typhaeon> This is not what I expected this game to be like. Was expecting heavy use of setpieces & cinematics given what we saw at expos
[4:30:32] <+hrodbehrat> HEY PAT...tickle, tickle, tickle
[4:30:37] <+rottingpastry> More quests more quests more quests
[4:30:46] <RazYamiyo> yeaaaaa

[4:30:55] <@SoFarFetched> @zenith0111 nah I got nothing,just remember HONOR LUL

[4:31:15] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[4:31:21] <%weissguard> What is this, a crossover episode?
[4:31:23] <Lancaster_H> pat finish Bojack it's amazing
[4:31:25] <%spiritofmojave> 4Head
[4:31:28] <%Maids4lyfe> yes but it doesn't control like shit
[4:31:28] <%feMC_is_best_girl> is that a bojack reference
[4:31:32] <%Solarint> doesn't look like my kind of thing, tbh. I find the far cry open world-ish games really played out, and that's what this looks like so far.
[4:31:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> STANDOFF
[4:31:33] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> I rewatched yojimbo recently

[4:31:58] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> God that movie was good
[4:32:06] <+Over_ninek> yes
[4:32:09] <mopoloking> Is this shadow of japan
[4:32:10] <@SoFarFetched> It does,Pat just doesnt have it on for those who listen to the st ream.
[4:32:12] <ha2ken> Archers had no chance
[4:32:13] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @nw_kero yes

[4:32:51] <%trustycoyote> @Kiranol Looks great from my end. Best part is how good the loading and frame rate is
[4:32:51] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> Problem is the Japanese voice acting is not lip synced to the animation.
[4:32:52] <RazYamiyo> so therapeutic
[4:32:53] <%Maids4lyfe> okay and?
[4:32:54] <+yoshkosh20> psyche yourself up before you end his suffering

[4:43:50] <coridal_mercenary> wait.. doesn't this code of honor only apply to "honorable" opponents? like I'm 99% positive that if his uncle watched monglos kill all types of civilians then he would be like "fuck these guys"
[4:43:51] <+ItsAGundamu> can you change the voice acting language in the game?
[4:43:51] <Lancaster_H> that animation aint right
[4:43:55] <%bigboyeggo> yes :)
[4:43:55] <DestroPrime83> Motherfucker you look 30

[4:43:58] <Ner234> monkaS
[4:44:01] <+PortableBoredom> But "save my little boy" sounds a lot better than "please save this 30 year old loser"
[4:44:06] <xtremegamer80> Technically Boy just means the son of someone you know

[4:44:31] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Monkeyweed21 I was about to just say that xD
[4:44:33] <%SpookyCarnage> @coridal_mercenary someone said earlier in the game that samurai always have to remain higher than their opponents and not stoop to their tactics
[4:44:46] <heartlesshealer> what technique did you get?
[4:44:46] <DSD24> @Story_Ark Spawn didn't get his cape looking good till Mortal Kombat 11
[4:44:55] <+ItsAGundamu> ahh nice
[4:44:59] <Brother_Coduss> @Fien111 And it's thinking like that that led the peasants to revolt and overthrow the samurai
[4:45:00] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah it's pretty much,even if someone fights dirty. You're still supposed to fight better than them and not stoop to their level of fighting.
[4:45:01] <coridal_mercenary> aight cool

[4:48:16] <+yoshkosh20> i dunno man. if I saw a dude deflect an arrow after I shot it at him. I'd turn and run.
[4:48:16] <%warmnoid> pretty colors
[4:48:17] <%DianaTheAscian> game good he like
[4:48:17] <+Skelegroove> It seems like this games definition of honor is just introducing yourself to the enemy before slaughtering them
[4:48:24] <%toastybites> why would you not just give up if the guy you're fighting literally deflects an arrow
[4:48:26] <+TopTieramisu> famitsu gave this game a perfect score
[4:48:29] <$Caped_Eggy> Ehh not as good as Deadly premonition 2
[4:48:32] <$ragingbrachy> one thumb up
[4:48:35] <+rottingpastry> pat like thumb up where?

[4:48:45] <nzrai> i guess to uphold big honor in terms of mechanics, you gotta git gud
[4:48:45] <DSD24> @Skelegroove Killing but being more obvious about it
[4:48:47] <%realm_forge> Agro!
[4:48:47] <%Maids4lyfe> why the fuck would anyone say it's supposed to be campy samurai movies?
[4:48:49] <Tucker0603> damn, big orange forest looks sexy
[4:48:50] <+Sendrak70> Dont ginko trees smell real bad?
[4:48:51] <%michingmallecho> psaUp psaUp
[4:48:51] <%GingerStrawhat> Pat like game good?
[4:48:52] <bustawof> So fucking pretty
[4:48:55] <+megaotter> did pat finish dp2?
[4:48:58] <+LordBleckZ> So chat, is the gameplay like the arkham games? Cause on first glance it kind of looks that way.
[4:48:58] <%Maids4lyfe> it was never presented as such in trailers
[4:49:01] <zenith0111> I hope they drop the honor crap soon or else this game will be so pretentious
[4:49:06] <%Calenrow> this is so heckin pretty scenery
[4:49:07] <$ragingbrachy> he... just said he likes the game
[4:49:11] <$floralkami> @skelegroove there are options Pat isn't using, like bowing and not stabbing downed enemies
[4:49:16] <%indig0bird> Jesus fucking christ, that is so pretty
[4:49:17] <%logoth_> Block the arrows with your...sword?
[4:49:25] <SnarkyDole> @Maids4lyfe There is a Kurosawa mode.
[4:49:26] <TioXyco> did he just yell "DISCOUNTS" ?
[4:49:26] <heartlesshealer> yeah, endless arrow guarding is nice
[4:49:26] <+Over_ninek> that's a little dumb that they yell get down when there's no one who needs to
[4:49:30] <%pipboy344> What’s this about Honor?
[4:49:32] <+Story_Ark> pat hates the game actually. he feels like its not very realistic /jkjk
[4:49:32] <Brother_Coduss> @zenith0111 yes because its so bad for people to say acting like a coward is bad
[4:49:36] <@SoFarFetched> @zenith0111 I mean it's pretty much the main thing about the game,is whether or not you fight honorably or not.
[4:49:36] <heartlesshealer> it's the technique pat just picked up
[4:49:36] <%logoth_> He's yelling get down
[4:49:37] <myriad_truth> The sneaking is like Arkam, combat definitely not
[4:49:40] <%dinnydanny777> DO THE THING WITH THE FOX
[4:49:41] <%Solarint> looks way too easy, reminds me of shadow of mordon/assassins creed combat. But god damn its pretty

[4:50:16] <SnarkyDole> Papa Kuma got wrecked
[4:50:18] <+professormorrigan> did the samurai really battle bears?
[4:50:20] <codycurry52> I'm not used to Bears being weak in games
[4:50:21] <%twoto858> Dead bear FeelsBadMan
[4:50:22] <%SwdVengeance> Where's the anti bear stance?
[4:50:23] <alwayspronking> NO HONOR FOR BEAR
[4:50:23] <nzrai> that was an honorable encounter
[4:50:27] <MrNoobMcSalt> where is your HONOR bear!
[4:50:28] <%toolofparanoia> KILL FOX
[4:50:29] <$floralkami> @maids4lyfe the game literally has an option to make it look like an old movie, what are you on about?
[4:50:32] <+yoshkosh20> that fox owes you a life debt now
[4:50:33] <@commanderclaw> Can you pet the fox?
[4:50:35] <+Remery_> pet it fast
[4:50:36] <zhenthrim321> IM IMMORTAL
[4:50:37] <+Story_Ark> Zuko would love this game
[4:50:40] <%toolofparanoia> ITS A DEMON
[4:50:41] <+Neoripo> Fire Fox!
[4:50:43] <+yoshkosh20> dadly no
[4:50:43] <LeBlanc233> this is an incredibly good looking game
[4:50:46] <+BIumen> why does this feel like mgsv
[4:50:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> pet
[4:50:50] <@SoFarFetched> @pipboy344 Cause the main theme of this game is whether or not you're fighting honorably. Since you get the option of fighting as a samurai,or fight dirty.
[4:50:54] <+rottingpastry> "Check this shit out, bro"
[4:50:54] <%Maids4lyfe> @floralkami that isn't what I'm fucking talking about
[4:50:55] <%Fien111> THat's a huge fox, god damn
[4:50:55] <Spyder1246> Foxhound?!?!?
[4:50:56] <%pipboy344> What is this Honor mechanic people keep mentioning
[4:50:59] <+Story_Ark> god damn that cape is good
[4:51:01] <%spiritofmojave> 👏
[4:51:02] <%toolofparanoia> OMG that
[4:51:02] <NatetheHunter> you pet that fox
[4:51:04] <%feMC_is_best_girl> Where's this foxes apron nyannLion
[4:51:08] <Gieron667> too me it feels more like the witcher
[4:51:08] <Spyder1246> Grey Fox?!?!?
[4:51:10] <$ragingbrachy> Clap
[4:51:10] <%toolofparanoia> is fucking adorable
[4:51:24] <+Story_Ark> is the gameplay like witcher?
[4:51:26] <$floralkami> @maids4lyfe campy doesn't mean corny, dude
[4:51:26] <+FinetiConfetti> Kon Kon Kitsune!
[4:51:30] <%toolofparanoia> Fox Friend!
[4:51:36] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Hey, I just showed up. How's the game so far?
[4:51:38] <Kurrisum> that is nice that they show you where you can do it
[4:51:40] <+Story_Ark> thank god
[4:51:42] <+rottingpastry> Mind boggling
[4:51:43] <%pipboy344> @sofarfetched So a morality system like inFAMOUS. What’s it do?
[4:51:46] <SnarkyDole> we gotta go visit a trapper now
[4:51:46] <zhenthrim321> sold
[4:51:48] <DesertPenguin> Fox Hound?
[4:51:48] <Brother_Coduss> @pipboy344 fighting people honorably or being a sneaky coward is a mechanic and apparently effects things
[4:51:49] <%aishman> You know Pat likes a game when he's been going for almost 5 hours
[4:51:49] <+Skelegroove> Is saving the hostages without stealth killing viable?
[4:51:50] <%toolofparanoia> haha
[4:51:52] <%Solarint> I wonder how many hours of crunch was required for these leaves to blow realistically Kappa
[4:51:54] <%Totally_not_toby> what a concept
[4:51:55] <DesertPenguin> Aggro!
[4:51:59] <zenith0111> @sofarfetched But fighting "dirty" is just having stealth kills and surprise attacks. Which is a common tactic in... all wars. Pretty prententious of this game tbh.
[4:52:02] <%legendscar01> honor everywhere
[4:52:02] <%Afterman_> @pipboy344 there is no morality system
[4:52:04] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> shots fired
[4:52:10] <%toolofparanoia> Big oof for CDprojectred
[4:52:13] <LeBlanc233> Pat and the way of the coward
[4:52:15] <+yoshkosh20> gotta kill them real quick if you go loud
[4:52:24] <%WhereIsWill> uh oh we for honor now
[4:52:28] <RazYamiyo> shot fired!!
[4:52:30] <+rottingpastry> Stand and get fucked, bitch
[4:52:30] <Brother_Coduss> @toolofparanoia why?
[4:52:31] <MoonShapedPuddle> the main appeal of this game its that is an homage to old samurai movies, It was marketed as such, why are people surprised
[4:52:33] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> After all, what use is honor to a dead man?
[4:52:34] <SnarkyDole> Ah, the Wizardry 8 take on random encounters. I see.
[4:52:36] <myriad_truth> SMOOTH AS SILK
[4:52:39] <@SoFarFetched> @zenith0111 Yeah but it's the whole "never sink to their level and always take high road" Because you know morals and stuff.
[4:52:47] <%pipboy344> So using the stealth they showed off in all gameplay is bad?
[4:52:55] <+Edrem> no mikiri counter DansGame
[4:52:56] <%sleepers1mulant> the standoff mechanic is dumb but so good at the same time
[4:53:00] <+MoonObscure> niceeeeeeeeeeeee
[4:53:00] <DesertPenguin> As cool as the combat is, there aren't enough death animations
[4:53:01] <%Afterman_> @pipboy344 no
[4:53:02] <+Sendrak70> No, its just sneaky
[4:53:02] <@SoFarFetched> @pipboy344 We dont know for sure what the consequences are,so far you just get flashbacks to the uncle in this game telling you to not fight dirty and be the bigger person in a fight.
[4:53:03] <%Kyderz3> i rather play onimusha Kappa
[4:53:04] <+PortableBoredom> Quick teabag them for maximum honour
[4:53:05] <$floralkami> @moonshapedpuddle i have no idea other than people don't pay attention
[4:53:10] <jonesybot_5000> u Never see those guys
[4:53:11] <Brother_Coduss> @Valentinius_Anodyne cause the honorable go to valhalla. the craven go to helheim.
[4:53:11] <%pipboy344> Like stabbing through paper doors?
[4:53:11] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Hows the combat? I heard it's one of the best for Open World games
[4:53:15] <%Cavumentum> @pipboy344 far as I know, no it isn't, the samurai just complain because they're haughty bastards
[4:53:16] <OvaltineDream> Well you disappoint your uncle, so in that way it's bad
[4:53:16] <%Shubreaker> god this place is so pretty
[4:53:19] <+Story_Ark> I don't know if the game actually says that stealth is BAD. unless it changes the ending in a bad way
[4:53:19] <zenith0111> @sofarfetched But the mongels are just standing there brute forcing their way into villages? Which is the opposite of what "dirty" fighting is
[4:53:20] <+theodolitejones> I don't like how the enemies immediatly get covered in blood
[4:53:22] <ManfredA> people being surprised that samurai culture values honor over practicality are like
[4:53:25] <ManfredA> what
[4:53:32] <DesertPenguin> @PatStaresAt Does it feel like Arkham Spider-Man?
[4:53:32] <+rottingpastry> I really hope this game doesn't let honor determine your ending because ew
[4:53:33] <+Animatic_> so how does honor work...?
[4:53:34] <%Fien111> @pipboy344 Not bad, but you become dishonorable and the story is effected probably? More like a different path I think
[4:53:38] <zhenthrim321> you said the water looked bad
[4:53:38] <ManfredA> that's samurai 101
[4:53:40] <%toolofparanoia> @Brother_Coduss Pat said if the witcher played well. CDPR games are buggy af when they first come out usually
[4:53:41] <%srkAres> it also looks so much better than sekiro
[4:53:44] <$Caped_Eggy> Winds howling
[4:53:46] <myriad_truth> A complete reversal to LOU2
[4:53:46] <Shwepie> More so than Wind Waker?
[4:53:46] <+theodolitejones> Ugh that wind would ruin my damn ear
[4:53:47] <%srkAres> the combat i mean
[4:53:48] <+Over_ninek> it's a good wind Pat
[4:53:48] <+Story_Ark> thats good. the combat was the one thing i wanted to be solid, especially for samurai games
[4:53:49] <$shaidot> windwaker?
[4:53:50] <%Emperor_Machinus> If you dishonor an honorable opponents does that mean you stole their honor so it is yours now?
[4:53:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> better than Sekiro
[4:53:56] <alwayspronking> its windy even inside
[4:54:00] <%spiritofmojave> It's damn pretty with the wind though
[4:54:00] <Brother_Coduss> @toolofparanoia the witcher 3 did play well
[4:54:03] <+Remery_> Never appreciated wind until i saw this game
[4:54:05] <SnarkyDole> @zenith0111 Mongols were quite accustomed to just... y'know... walk all over you.
[4:54:09] <%indig0bird> WAIT! You can pick up resources on horse? This is the BEST game ever
[4:54:11] <+RichAnvils> the land of wind and ghosts
[4:54:11] <%zamzoph> Why is it that everyone's talking about samurai and honor while making no mention of the fantasy of ninjas? 🤔
[4:54:15] <%pipboy344> Should I get Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise? I like Yakuza
[4:54:19] <%dukenux> oh cool, guy that you helped before
[4:54:22] <@SoFarFetched> @zenith0111 Well my assumption is it's they're not doing things the "right" way.
[4:54:30] <%dinnydanny777> Omg Onimusha was that old PS2 game I used to like, shit I could never remember what it was
[4:54:32] <zenith0111> @snarkydole So how dare one soldier use tactics to kill HUNDREDS of enemies LUL
[4:54:32] <OvaltineDream> LUL
[4:54:35] <RazYamiyo> @zamzoph too true

[4:54:38] <Brother_Coduss> @zamzoph get your naruto shite outta here
[4:54:38] <@SoFarFetched> which you know,to each their own on "right ways"
[4:54:39] <%dinnydanny777> Where you could rooftop run
[4:54:46] <heartlesshealer> bye emblo
[4:54:47] <%dinnydanny777> Onimusha was fucking sick
[4:54:47] <+Sendrak70> Are we sure this isnt just some kind of elaborate Sly Cooper prequel yet?
[4:54:48] <myriad_truth> Onimusha was fun
[4:54:51] <%PettyFunk> Zoom fast baby
[4:54:52] <ManfredA> be honest is this some people's first samurai media
[4:54:53] <Demonicstevo> Can you pick a difficult in game
[4:54:56] <ManfredA> this honor shit is all basic as fuck
[4:54:59] <$ragingbrachy> upblade
[4:55:03] <+theodolitejones> How exactly do you upgrade an already forged sword?
[4:55:04] <+yoshkosh20> get better scabbards
[4:55:11] <%Fien111> So is the sword the only main weapon you get?
[4:55:12] <Monkeyweed21> dumbass
[4:55:13] <%pipboy344> JEAN RENO IN ANCIENT JAPAN WITH GUNS
[4:55:15] <%dinnydanny777> Honour shit was historically basic as fuck
[4:55:15] <+megaotter> my kaytannah yeehaw plague of gripes
[4:55:18] <@SoFarFetched> ah yes I Ron Butterfly
[4:55:20] <$floralkami> @manfreda IT SOUNDS LIKE IT.
[4:55:21] <%Shubreaker> fold it again
[4:55:22] <+Zombiemowlcher> FOLDED OVER 1000 TIMES
[4:55:25] <+Neoripo> Get more Pig Airon
[4:55:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> ungraded your taint
[4:55:27] <%Maids4lyfe> why would you do that
[4:55:32] <%WhereIsWill> maybe you can trade for more iron?
[4:55:33] <%Maids4lyfe> you wasted your materials
[4:55:37] <+OwlLightningMage> SAY A WORD CORRECTLY I DON'T EVEN CARE WHICH ONE
[4:55:38] <myriad_truth> Yeah, let us fight with honor as long as I can win
[4:55:39] <%AncelDeLambert> oh thank god the game has just straight upgrades. I can't even begin to talk about how much the gear in God of War slowed down the game for me
[4:55:39] <stardustcrusad3r> i ron u pat
[4:55:39] <+yoshkosh20> @theodolitejones oil it sensually. makes it harder
[4:55:40] <SnarkyDole> @pipboy344 It's very similar to Yakuza, but if you don't like the epic tale of Kenshiro or aren't into constant fountains of blood and limbs, it's a no-no. I'm loving it still.
[4:55:46] <%Calenrow> no its a peasant
[4:55:48] <nzrai> it's your daily login gift
[4:55:48] <+OwlLightningMage> YOU CAN'T RUIN ALL LANGUAGE
[4:55:55] <heartlesshealer> iron was shit back then in that part of the world, so it kinda needed to be folded over 1000 times
[4:55:56] <$ragingbrachy> @OwlLightningMage OMEGALUL
[4:55:58] <Shwepie> @theodolitejones You take new iron and just hammer it in. Or secretly give them a whole new sword.
[4:56:01] <@SoFarFetched> @floralkami I assume they're putting more theme into honor,since I assume the old samurai movies did that too. I wouldn't know personally since I never watched the old samurai films. But I've wanted to.
[4:56:02] <%AncelDeLambert> I left off on crafting so much shit in God of War because I was never sure when the game would just GIVE me something better
[4:56:02] <RazYamiyo> so? dark souls pvp had honor too, should'nt be too surprising LUL
[4:56:09] <heartlesshealer> they weren't able to reach the good stuff yet
[4:56:09] <zenith0111> Can't wait till the game gives you grenade and then shame you for using the grenade
[4:56:12] <D3rrtyD4n> orange
[4:56:19] <+KingofTwitchTV> !uptime!
[4:56:20] <jonesybot_5000> david bowyer Kappa
[4:56:22] <+OwlLightningMage> No honor
[4:56:26] <arkv01> I AM ONCE AGAIN ASKING
[4:56:29] <%spiritofmojave> Pat's out to bastardize words to get more clicks, the NERVE Kappa
[4:56:30] <ManfredA> Honor is the guiding principle of the apocryphal bushido code
[4:56:32] <+theodolitejones> You get a gun *Flashback* The gun is a cowards weapon!
[4:56:34] <@SoFarFetched> @zenith0111 excuse you,you mean a BOOMSTICK (aka gun LUL)
[4:56:38] <@SoFarFetched> LUL *
[4:56:44] <MattyValor> How is the game so far? My pre-order comes in tomorrow so I'm excited.
[4:56:46] <+Remery_> Waiting for the flintlock pistols, and bring more shame to your family name
[4:56:49] <ManfredA> in reality Samurai, like knights and their code of chivalry, only really applied it to other noble or landed people
[4:56:51] <ivanmistwalker> PogChamp
[4:56:51] <%Emperor_Machinus> Gif
[4:56:51] <LordOfThePoultry> put it on
[4:56:52] <%Faustgesicht> you put that on

[4:56:54] <%WhereIsWill> 10 iron PogChamp
[4:56:54] <+ImTrin> you got more iron
[4:56:55] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt You have Iron now
[4:56:56] <MoonShapedPuddle> guys of course the samurai code isnt practical its an honor code, the whole point is to oppose it to the ruthless practical approach of the mongols
[4:56:57] <CursedNobleman> YEEEEE
[4:56:58] <%AncelDeLambert> We see you have boomstick. (hm yes, yes) Bye byeeeeee
[4:56:59] <+superkeaton> Woosh
[4:57:00] <+FinetiConfetti> ancient Japanese patreon
[4:57:00] <Kurrisum> you can do your main sword now
[4:57:01] <coridal_mercenary> so wait where the fuck is the army? shouldn't they be all over this
[4:57:06] <LordOfThePoultry> yeyeyeye
[4:57:07] <%PettyFunk> THE MASK IS THE FACEWEAR OF A COWARD, JIN
[4:57:10] <arkv01> yeet

[4:57:13] <+Neoripo> You got Airon
[4:57:14] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you can upgrade you katana now Pog
[4:57:16] <+nirvana227> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:57:17] <Dr_Mooose> cool
[4:57:18] <%Emperor_Machinus> Now get hat!
[4:57:22] <%Shubreaker> yall remember when mgs gave you rad guns and then reduced your score when you used them
[4:57:28] <+OwlLightningMage> Little too much orange
[4:57:32] <111111sagas111111> Am I crazy or does this look far less visually impressive than I expected?
[4:57:40] <+OwlLightningMage> It's like a carrot exploded
[4:57:40] <IamGrapes> this game looks so nice
[4:57:44] <IamGrapes> very pretty
[4:57:44] <KaliasTV> Gift gave you 10 iron too
[4:57:51] <%pipboy344> @snarkydole I don’t know much about Fist of the North Star aside from the well known stuff. I’m the kind of guy that wished Shadow Warrior had more human enemies I could slice apart and replayed the Wolfenstein 2009 demo multiple times trying to blow off limbs
[4:57:56] <DSD24> @Shubreaker Peace Walker was the worst about this. So many guns but you had to use tranq's to get S ranks
[4:57:57] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @coridal_mercenary There is no army, just warlords
[4:58:06] <@SoFarFetched> Now Im just thinking of that scene from Indiana Jones where a guy was showing his sword skills to him,then Indie just pulls out his gun to shoot him and he walks away LUL
[4:58:09] <%dukenux> @OwlLightningMage it's like i'm looking through a bottle of Fanta.
[4:58:16] <ManfredA> what time period is this
[4:58:18] <+Skelegroove> Traditional japanese forge with a western sawyers anvil
[4:58:18] <ManfredA> specifically
[4:58:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> its a carrot sunset
[4:58:26] <%AncelDeLambert> Poor tired Harrison Ford
[4:58:28] <+ImTrin> @SoFarFetched no honor!
[4:58:29] <Lancaster_H> @ManfredA 1247 i believe
[4:58:30] <OvaltineDream> Late 1200s I thuink?
[4:58:31] <%sleepers1mulant> monk: take a fucking shower
[4:58:31] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @ManfredA 1274
[4:58:33] <heartlesshealer> I like how the damage explanation is just "Kill enemies faster"
[4:58:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> this is 1400s right
[4:58:38] <$floralkami> @sofarfetched yeah, that's pretty much what this is doing and literally what the game was marketed as. this is why game sometimes feel like games have to dumb down their themes to suit younger people who never been introduced to certain themes.
[4:58:39] <+OwlLightningMage> @dukenux LUL
[4:58:40] <myriad_truth> To master the mind you must first master the body
[4:58:40] <ManfredA> then yeah
[4:58:41] <%AncelDeLambert> "Gah, fuck this scene, I'm done with this shit. Can't I just shoot him?"
[4:58:46] <ManfredA> Japan isn't really a nation
[4:58:48] <%Fien111> @SoFarFetched Apparently that was Harison having the shits and not wanting to do the big fight scene they had planned and they went with it cause it was great
[4:58:49] <IamGrapes> oh man a hot spring sounds so nice right now
[4:58:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> I guess its 1200s
[4:58:50] <ManfredA> it's a collection of warlords
[4:58:51] <%Maids4lyfe> 1274
[4:58:51] <%dukenux> Could you imagine Harrisof Ford is 98 years old?
[4:58:55] <%BluBarracuda> get aked fucker
[4:58:55] <%pipboy344> The guy from Nioh is based on a real white samurai
[4:58:56] <%DianaTheAscian> what year is this?
[4:58:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 1274
[4:59:04] <111111sagas111111> we going to get a bath scene? thorwOh
[4:59:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Fien111 didnt know that trivia LUL it does make it better for that scene
[4:59:08] <myriad_truth> I thought Harrison hurt himself
[4:59:16] <mastermidget23> Just got back, how's he liking it?
[4:59:17] <+Over_ninek> no it's fucked
[4:59:21] <+Over_ninek> get some new shit
[4:59:21] <DSD24> Hachiman was rad
[4:59:22] <%sleepers1mulant> wasnt it broken ribs
[4:59:33] <$ragingbrachy> he likes the game
[4:59:33] <%count_bob> BIRB!
[4:59:36] <zenith0111> @pipboy344 My friend took that games story as 100% historically factual
[4:59:36] <%DianaTheAscian> he like
[4:59:37] <ManfredA> also if you want cool ninja game go back and play Tenchu guys
[4:59:37] <%pipboy344> Second Mongolian Invasion of Japan right?
[4:59:38] <ManfredA> it's good
[4:59:40] <%Calenrow> BIR
[4:59:41] <+RadicalPirate> Sony gave Pat a code?
[4:59:42] <RazYamiyo> nice rags though
[4:59:42] <%Calenrow> B I R B
[4:59:48] <zenith0111> @pipboy344 Yes even the ghosts and shit
[4:59:48] <Profmcstevie> I'm an Armorer not a miracle worker MrDestructoid
[4:59:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> First invasion
[4:59:51] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> no the first invasion
[5:00:00] <+megaotter> boyuer's like to watch
[5:00:00] <%dinnydanny777> Can we pet the fox now
[5:00:01] <SnarkyDole> @pipboy344 If you have a tolerance for the staple Japanese cheese and don't mind certain technical elements to feel a bit old timey (vehicle stuff is a bit dodgy), you might just like the Fist-flavour of a Yakuza game. Fun mini games, a very classic story line... And an excellent song on the car radio, if you want it.
[5:00:03] <%dinnydanny777> Pls
[5:00:05] <heartlesshealer> oh damn
[5:00:06] <%Fien111> dayum
[5:00:07] <%DianaTheAscian> wow

[5:00:13] <%dinnydanny777> GivePLZ Fox pets
[5:00:13] <%bigboyeggo> way better than DP2's reflections LUL
[5:00:14] <%pipboy344> @zenith0111 Including the demons and ghosts?
[5:00:17] <@SoFarFetched> @floralkami I feel like the problem is there's probably many people besides me who dont know about the old samurai films or watched them. So I'm pretty sure that may be the reason why people don't understand the things about this game. But to each their own.
[5:00:18] <+Remery_> cow
[5:00:21] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> My history degree was not specialized in ancient east east asian history, more modern east asian
[5:00:22] <Joustar_> money puddle
[5:00:22] <%count_bob> Biiirb
[5:00:24] <SpaceGuntank> RTX ON
[5:00:30] <%dinnydanny777> Can you pet a Fox pls
[5:00:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> Nioh has a historical basis but even the historical parts are heavily altered excluding all the fantasy stuff
[5:00:34] <$floralkami> @zenith0111 sounds like your friend needs to read some more books
[5:00:35] <+Remery_> or ox
[5:00:35] <%dinnydanny777> GivePLZ Fox pets
[5:00:38] <zhenthrim321> DP2 reflections are just the void
[5:00:43] <+xSigent> Why "Bowyer" instead of Fletcher???
[5:00:44] <+parzano> Hey Pat how is Tsushima? do u like it overall?
[5:00:47] <$Timesteel> ya that’s pretty good considering it’s baked in and not rtx
[5:00:50] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> but this game is yes more focused on samurai MOVIES rather than samurai history
[5:00:51] <$ragingbrachy> anyone know where you can watch the kurosawa movies?
[5:00:52] <zenith0111> @pipboy344 YES she's fucking nuts
[5:00:54] <MoonShapedPuddle> I like that graphics wise they focused on the scenery more than anything else
[5:00:58] <+ImTrin> why is kazejin working so hard
[5:00:59] <%zamzoph> was it a fake reflection? I didn't see it long enough, but it looked like the tree lined up
[5:01:00] <Lancaster_H> hey did Sony fund this?
[5:01:07] <SnarkyDole> @parzano He likes. He thumbs up long time.
[5:01:08] <%pipboy344> @snarkydole Song? Don’t tell me they put in everybody’s favorite, 24-Hour Cinderella
[5:01:13] <ManfredA> you guys should watch Kingo
[5:01:14] <+Story_Ark> by understand do they find things in the game actually confusing, or is it more a "this isnt realistic"?
[5:01:16] <%croxeye> PAT NO
[5:01:17] <%Fien111> HORSE DED
[5:01:18] <%DianaTheAscian> EAT SHIT

[5:01:29] <MoonShapedPuddle> poor horse :(
[5:01:29] <myriad_truth> They sacrificed Infamous to make this
[5:01:32] <ManfredA> or I believe it's called Harakiri
[5:01:32] <+parzano> he do big thumbs up for long time
[5:01:35] <BleedinActionMan> @Story_Ark the latter
[5:01:37] <socratetris> that horse seems a kot healthier than the Red Dead horses.
[5:01:39] <TheBadonkulator> FOX GIRL TIME
[5:01:40] <%DianaTheAscian> right
[5:01:43] <Sunstalker> I love that this game has the witcher thing of making your horse run fast enough to let you jump after calling it swiftly, unlike rdr2 that stopped doing that
[5:01:44] <%dinnydanny777> GAWRSH SORA, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIED
[5:01:48] <%Fien111> Pat now has to invent the gun in Japan to shoot the horse whose leg he just broke
[5:01:48] <%michingmallecho> infamous had its chance
[5:01:49] <zenith0111> @myriad_truth Now I'm sad....
[5:01:52] <%michingmallecho> 3 chances
[5:02:02] <+FinetiConfetti> What a nice cat
[5:02:20] <OvaltineDream> gecker
[5:02:20] <%dinnydanny777> They can always make another Infamous game...
[5:02:21] <ManfredA> Prototype should've been the one to succeed
[5:02:21] <+cvp5127> this is just samurai infamous tho
[5:02:23] <+Story_Ark> then thats kinda silly. i dont watch old samurai movies but i still understand the game isnt trying to be realistic. then again i hate games that try too hard to be realistic and just want something cool so
[5:02:25] <+parzano> what a nice duwang
[5:02:25] <ManfredA> Infamous was never as good
[5:02:28] <ezack4> in china, they would eat that fox MingLee
[5:02:29] <FLAWDREW> <3
[5:02:29] <+rottingpastry> Chase furry
[5:02:30] <Sunstalker> Sacrificed Infamous? It had 3 games and a DLC
[5:02:31] <myriad_truth> The first two were good
[5:02:32] <$ragingbrachy> what happens if you shoot the fox
[5:02:41] <%SolidusRex> Follow Tamamo
[5:02:43] <MoonShapedPuddle> theres probably going to be an infamous 3 for ps5
[5:02:43] <%zestyArsenic> shit sounds like my cat meowing
[5:02:44] <blackbookalpha> Do you fight Director Akira Kurosawa in this game?
[5:02:47] <socratetris> Jin: * casually rips tree from the ground while chasinf wild animal *
[5:02:47] <FLAWDREW> flooof boi
[5:02:48] <+rottenmeatpuppet> Can't wait to play this tomorrow. I keep hearing great things. Has Pat been enjoying the game so far?

[5:03:30] <$floralkami> @sofarfetched but you didn't even have to watch these movies to know if then and their tropes, like you of course. you're at least using your brain to understand that a fictional story is being told, instead of trying to pick it apart with historical fact
[5:03:32] <%JohnAtDawn> LOOK AT THE PRETTY
[5:03:32] <Profmcstevie> Fox mating sounds are fucking horrid, I hope this game has lots of them

[5:06:18] <$WhereIsWill> COMMIT TO IT
[5:06:19] <%Shubreaker> i still think it's crazy they gave Pat a sponsor for GoT after the LoU Pt 2 stream
[5:06:21] <ChungusQuest> a suicide sandwich with floof filling, this is tasty content
[5:06:22] <OldManDeckardCain> you can also pet the ground Kappa

[5:06:49] <bluebiscuit94> You should do the Lady Masako quest first, since it's gold it means that it's still part of the main quest

[5:07:27] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> So, what's everyone's opinion of this game so far?
[5:07:30] <%Fien111> That's not a shield, it's a a fucking door

[5:07:59] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @prismaliner funny you say that, many lint eastwood westerns were based on previous samurai films
[5:08:02] <myriad_truth> Clint Eastwood movies are actually based on Samurai movies
[5:08:04] <Mr_Rakjo> Normal
[5:08:05] <%Fien111> I do love how small and subtle the interface and UI is most of the time
[5:08:10] <heartlesshealer> well, you weren't killing adds
[5:08:11] <prismaliner> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense it looks awesome
[5:08:16] <bluebiscuit94> Again, do the 1st Lady Masako quest, it's part of the Main Story since it's GOLD
[5:08:16] <Profmcstevie> Because they came properly dressed
[5:08:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> FIGHT LIKE SAMURAI NOT LIKE KING ARTHER KNIGHTO

[5:08:20] <LeBlanc233> Real trained soldiers i guess
[5:08:21] <%dinnydanny777> Star Wars is based on Samurai movirs
[5:08:21] <%indig0bird> Hey Pat, please keep playing this game, even in moments of exploration everything is super gorgeous
[5:08:23] <+ALazo> A quantom leap is a tiny distance, though.
[5:08:24] <zenith0111> They died in 3 hits tho

[5:08:37] <%Shubreaker> gunslingers and samurai are basically the same thing
[5:08:41] <myriad_truth> Star Wars is based on WW2'
[5:08:42] <+rottenmeatpuppet> Yeah defeinitely liking how minimilistic the UI is.
[5:08:42] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Another game to add to the list I think
[5:08:42] <xtremegamer80> Oh hey torii gates

[5:09:03] <+Story_Ark> katanas are based on samurai movies
[5:09:09] <myriad_truth> Who would challenge this guy??
[5:09:16] <zenith0111> I'm kinda sick of open world games atm so this came out at a weird tome for me
[5:09:21] <%dukenux> Star Wars is a mix of western and samurai movies, Flash Gordon and WWII dogfights
[5:09:22] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> TrevIn3Dimensions subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Ghost of tsushima?! neat! hows the combat? it kinda looks like more assassins creed
[5:09:25] <haitakaa> did pat really get lost in Japan or was that a meme
[5:09:40] <%dinnydanny777> If Star Wars is WW2 the bad guys wouldn't be British
[5:09:45] <nw_kero> deflecting arrows is the goofiest thing in the game so far

[5:10:31] <RazYamiyo> this gameplay was brought to you by sony Kappa

[5:14:20] <+Skelegroove> Outer wilds is open world the same way wind waker is. Linear sections with open traversal between them

[5:14:30] <%SolidusRex> @BleedinActionMan I know it's Chinese not Japanese, but the General Tsao fight in Sly 3 is radiating the sort of energy this game has

[5:14:54] <zenith0111> @covil91 Lots of people have been hating on the camera the whole time

[5:15:02] <+jakefdaniels> Is the horse actually just named Sora in the game, or is there some other reason people are calling it that?
[5:15:14] <nzrai> you can choose the name
[5:15:16] <BleedinActionMan> @SolidusRex Yeah, I see it, kind of
[5:15:21] <%michingmallecho> You have 3 choices
[5:15:23] <%SolidusRex> You can name the horse Sora
[5:15:25] <%spiritofmojave> @jakefdaniels it's the horse's name you can choose
[5:15:26] <TioXyco> @jakefdaniels it's called sora in game, yeah

[5:38:39] <SnarkyDole> please put on your Sunday hair.
[5:38:41] <%Fien111> The combination is limited character limit
[5:38:43] <@SoFarFetched> which would have made more sense on woolies s tream.

[5:39:05] <ShinobiPhoenix> I assume if you own it, the game will just play on PS5
[5:39:09] <Travmanic> Gonna wait for ps5 to get this
[5:39:11] <Monkeyweed21> Woolie is doing that thing where he massively overthinks a game for children and turns a 30 hour game into 70 or 80 hours @PatStaresAt
[5:39:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Woolie has bad planning goblins
[5:39:14] <%joylent_blue> he just wanted more people to point and laugh at woolie with him

[5:39:46] <Monkeyweed21> still a great LP tho
[5:39:46] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat has embraced the wrong
[5:39:50] <DatAsuna> and it's a 60 hour game at worst
[5:39:55] <%BubbaRands> So it's a woolie playthrough? Kappa
[5:39:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Or the courage to be wrong and tell the universe "NO U"
