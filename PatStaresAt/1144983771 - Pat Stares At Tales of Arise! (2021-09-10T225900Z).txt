[0:09:09] <pcn24454> @nabs96 Yes
[0:09:10] <%Scevda> Hope you enjoy the game I in-part worked on Pat
[0:09:11] <marvel877> Because he has more hair than you, Pat.
[0:09:12] <%NitronStreams> I like Thor's design for the most part it feels like hes missing something
[0:09:12] <@ssjklyco> He looks like MCU fat thor. I like it
[0:09:12] <@goose_attack_almanac> Thor honestly should be a huge beefy guy like that.
[0:09:13] <+rdark_ksu> Idk Pat you've really been slimming down. Dont know if you still got the Thor bod

[0:09:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Chunky thor is the best thor
[0:09:17] <Madinki> I like it. He looks like a white Mark Henry.
[0:09:20] <@TheYellowcouch> REAL THOR
[0:09:22] <nabs96> @patstaresat Will you stream god of war 2? perhaps with a woolingtonz
[0:09:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Chungus Thor
[0:09:25] <Teneb0r> Tales of Arise! :u
[0:09:25] <%Piemono> YES
[0:09:30] <%AllenDeadman> that IS BASICALLY THOR
[0:09:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm shit with my hands, I'd rather pay for a manicure to make sure it's done well
[0:09:32] <jorniev> I WISH HIS ARMS WERE BIGER SO HE HUGGED BETTER
[0:09:32] <%boofybaps> Peak Thor
[0:09:34] <+Shishi1205> The vibe
[0:09:35] <%MajorCrasher> TRUE
[0:09:36] <%dirtyjames04> yea thats accurate
[0:09:37] <%DianaTheAscian> this is another fun exposing of many
[0:09:37] <+Delenay> i hope hes totally understanding of kratos past
[0:09:37] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Thor's design is realistic to a strongman's physique, honestly.
[0:09:38] <draca23> I only dislike Thor's design because he looks like my conspiracy theory uncle.
[0:09:39] <+kewlmyc> You described Wolverine
[0:09:40] <%AncelDeLambert> he looks like a Hell's Angel
[0:09:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Hells Angels Thor
[0:09:43] <+Delenay> like, yeah. gods suck
[0:09:44] <%RealThiele> VERY TRUE\
[0:09:44] <%DianaTheAscian> Yes
[0:09:46] <pcn24454> @goose_attack_almanac Hemsworth was too big for the first suit so he had to shrink down
[0:09:50] <gildor0> thats true
[0:09:50] <@TheYellowcouch> Thor is a man who drunk a bunch of giants under the table while wearing a wedding dress that man kicks ass
[0:09:51] <%shurtal> yup, goes along with how much an asshole thor was in the mythology
[0:09:52] <%AllenDeadman> nipples?
[0:09:53] <%Rumbutt> and then the other 4 cops take him to mcdonals
[0:09:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> The open chesT?
[0:09:54] <%AncelDeLambert> his armor is stupid
[0:09:55] <%PigGuy800> so I'm fighting a boss in no more heroes 3 that keeps one shoting me
[0:09:56] <scrumbotime> Thor drinks, eats, and fights, and probably drinks and eats more than fights.
[0:09:56] <%moonmintparadise> Very lore accurate
[0:09:56] <+tearsaurther> Paige is gonna get mad when you kill thor , gonna think its you
[0:09:57] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt He prob has done that
[0:09:58] <pcn24454> Only 6?
[0:09:59] <%DedlokPM> Oh no. Sony with a more mythology accurate design rather than copying what Marvel does!
[0:10:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> We get he's fat but doesn't need to show off the chest
[0:10:00] <%cvp5127> his stubby fingers
[0:10:01] <%AncelDeLambert> cover your gut before your hips, what is that
[0:10:02] <Astrophizz> the last game had a biker aesthetic too
[0:10:02] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> He looks like those guys you see doing crazy tree weightlift bullshit
[0:10:02] <chimeraxmachina> Lmao Thor’s design is fucking rad. His tits are out! I want to smooch him
[0:10:08] <%Monkeyweed21> its  the lack of armor
[0:10:09] <%Afterman_> YO REAL TALK. TYR LOOKS LIKE Kratos, did anyone else notice?
[0:10:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Knoife
[0:10:11] <+Shishi1205> Remember he beat up his son super hard for losing to kratos
[0:10:12] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Thor's design is realistic to a strongman's physique, honestly.
[0:10:12] <%AncelDeLambert> YEP
[0:10:14] <%YakumoYomi> I like this Thor. Not sure why his belly is exposed.
[0:10:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> As a person who knew people with Family in the Hells, fuck he looks like a typical Hells
[0:10:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea it looks weird
[0:10:18] <%DianaTheAscian> the exposed stomach is kinda goofy
[0:10:19] <bob900000> they don't care
[0:10:19] <AthenaAegis> THOR ORB Kappa
[0:10:19] <%Ziegsy> But when you heal instantly, who cares?
[0:10:19] <%cvp5127> its a show pat
[0:10:20] <%Monkeyweed21> or an axe
[0:10:20] <@TheYellowcouch> The armour is ornamental the gut is the real protection
[0:10:21] <%AncelDeLambert> MY ORGANS SHALL PROTECT ME
[0:10:22] <%full_circle> Or a taser sword
[0:10:24] <%NitronStreams> the shoulderpads with no belly covering
[0:10:25] <%hairtoday> THORB IS STRONG
[0:10:26] <%dirtyjames04> thats mind games pat
[0:10:28] <%MajorCrasher> they're gods, armor doesn't do shit
[0:10:28] <gildor0> but the exposed nips are important for showing you are manly and unafraid
[0:10:29] <%AllenDeadman> I mean when you can literally regenerate any wound... does it matter
[0:10:30] <%Eaglestrike117> To be fair its thor. He doenst fuckin care
[0:10:31] <%Rumbutt> THOR FUCKING DARES YOU TO STAB THE ORB, FUCKING TRY IT IDIOT
[0:10:31] <Treasure_Vault> What if your axe just sticks in his gut and he laughs at you?
[0:10:32] <%dirtyjames04> tactics
[0:10:32] <%shurtal> gotta make it challenging, thor's bored
[0:10:32] <$mattynezz> At least put on a shirt
[0:10:34] <nabs96> @patstaresat To be fair, gods are kinda immune to that ahit right
[0:10:35] <scrumbotime> Armor is for coward babies, also, God Meat Tough
[0:10:35] <%Ziegsy> itsTOUGH
[0:10:36] <%twistedj3ster> their moves are predictable then
[0:10:38] <MonsterGills> That's barbarian astec
[0:10:38] <Tracazoid> Draw them into a false sense of security by having your guts spilled on the floor, the perfect time for a counter attack
[0:10:39] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> HE HAS PROTECTIVE LAYER OF BLUBBER
[0:10:39] <Gorgs7> like female armor
[0:10:40] <%boofybaps> Everyones immortal in GoW
[0:10:40] <%Arnoldoaad1> Thats how he knows where they will attack
[0:10:42] <HaroldDonchee> imagine being a pussy and wearing armor
[0:10:44] <+Delenay> its bait
[0:10:44] <%full_circle> Thor take a took a taser to make a taser sword
[0:10:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Biblically LUL
[0:10:45] <Treasure_Vault> BIBLICAL THOR
[0:10:46] <%Monkeyweed21> A BIG LAD NEEDZ IZ GUTPLATE
[0:10:47] <MidnightPacif1c> the thicc is the armor
[0:10:47] <%moonmintparadise> Well Baldur was pretty much topless too and he didn't care
[0:10:50] <pcn24454> Too much armor ways you down
[0:10:50] <%Pukenasty> they will never make it through the fat layer natural armor
[0:10:51] <+Shishi1205> I mean his only rival is The snake that covers the world
[0:10:51] <%RayReborne> Ive Been playing Arise for 5 hours now! it good!
[0:10:52] <@TheYellowcouch> OH YEAH
[0:10:53] <%RealThiele> +1 Fat Armor
[0:10:55] <+Rachet20> There’s too many skits in this game so far
[0:10:56] <draca23> @PatStaresAt Maybe he's like Zangief and can break swords with his muscles!
[0:10:57] <nabs96> Oh yeah easily lmao
[0:10:57] <%AncelDeLambert> Kratos fucked up Zeus
[0:10:58] <%Scevda> while drunk!
[0:10:59] <%lucky_icarus> Even if I had Wolverine esque healing, I'd still wear armor. Shit fucking hurts
[0:10:59] <%polothegreatest> its a distraction psaLiz
[0:10:59] <%AllenDeadman> so should have zeus but here we are
[0:11:00] <%CatRidder> you cant stab a god in the gut
[0:11:01] <+tearsaurther> Was wanting more armor on thor
[0:11:02] <gildor0> he probably will that first time
[0:11:02] <Frogwash> Thor can lift yormungandr, he SHOULD win
[0:11:03] <%cvp5127> he beat zeus
[0:11:03] <@TheYellowcouch> Thor has donw way more impressive shit than Kratos
[0:11:04] <+Delenay> so how about that epic apple?
[0:11:05] <%furiousfurioso> that's probably why they need Tyr
[0:11:05] <Treasure_Vault> What if Kratos was really angry?
[0:11:08] <%DianaTheAscian> He prob will
[0:11:09] <@goose_attack_almanac> Thor will show Atreus why the drunk uncle is feared
[0:11:09] <%Monkeyweed21> yea he will lol
[0:11:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Kratos ALSO fucked up Ares
[0:11:11] <%RealThiele> yea and take his booze
[0:11:13] <%moonmintparadise> He had belly armor in the dream
[0:11:13] <scrumbotime> @moonmintparadise To be fair, that guy is LITERALLY INVINCIBLE
[0:11:17] <ohno778> Kratos took out the entire greek pantheon
[0:11:18] <MelonSouda> @moonmintparadise Yeah but his whole deal was that he was funtionally immortal
[0:11:21] <%shurtal> Kratos is old and busted
[0:11:23] <pcn24454> Less armor is good armor
[0:11:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Baldur got gimped by having no sensations
[0:11:24] <@TheYellowcouch> Thor wrestled the world serpent and almost drank all of the oceans
[0:11:26] <%AllenDeadman> I mean, not being able to FEEL anything
[0:11:28] <%VictorVonLouche> Just keep throwing thunderbolt from a far then smack him with the hammer
[0:11:31] <%AllenDeadman> would drive you insane
[0:11:34] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> I bought the collectors edition of tales and they emailed me a code as an apology for the delivery delay, but the code they sent didn't work and now my ps5 can't accept any codes I'm dead
[0:11:35] <+JustToWatch> he'll get an assist from Tyr
[0:11:35] <pcn24454> Is Odin going to show up?
[0:11:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Kratos barely beat a crackhead that loved feeling pain
[0:11:37] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Kratos washed gods that were a 9-1 matchup for him
[0:11:42] <MidnightPacif1c> what is Kratos does every sidequest
[0:11:45] <%DianaTheAscian> Baldur is like a party dude
[0:11:47] <%polothegreatest> AREEEESSS
[0:11:47] <MidnightPacif1c> if
[0:11:51] <%AllenDeadman> yes

[0:11:54] <%AllenDeadman> 100%
[0:11:55] <%Arnoldoaad1> so curious that both Bauldar and Thor are being played by people from Sons of Anarchy
[0:11:55] <%ChrisPlaysThing> NO
[0:11:57] <%Ziegsy> the lack of armor is to tempt you to attack the orb. Its the last mistake youll make
[0:11:57] <%RealThiele> ZOOOOOOS
[0:11:57] <%Scevda> roman propaganda!
[0:11:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Mars is an insane psychopath
[0:12:01] <%Rumbutt> that makes sense
[0:12:02] <xanerts> did they tho?
[0:12:04] <+Shishi1205> I mean relatively but yeah
[0:12:05] <@goose_attack_almanac> That's one of my favourite things about Percy JAckson.
[0:12:05] <%cvp5127> same person
[0:12:08] <%moonmintparadise> Didn't Thor crash at some worshippers house and was such an ass that when the woman asked him to leave, he killed her too?
[0:12:10] <%ChrisPlaysThing> (I mean yes really but) NO
[0:12:11] <nabs96> @patstaresat MARS IS AN OC DONUT STEELE
[0:12:13] <+rdark_ksu> They literally made it an institution
[0:12:13] <%jackythefrost> jackythefrost subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 19 month streak! Hey Pat, I know you've been very mixed on the Tales franchise. Here's hoping you enjoy Arise. Not as good as Berseria yet but Im still pretty early on
[0:12:14] <%boofybaps> Nothing compared to America, which is why Kratos wins.
[0:12:15] <$mattynezz> Alexander disagrees
[0:12:20] <%lucky_icarus> And the Roman Gods actual do their job and are serious about it.
[0:12:22] <%Garthunox> pat remember when people bitched you out for knowing who baldur was in the lp?
[0:12:22] <%AllenDeadman> how do you think the roman empire got THAT BIG?
[0:12:24] <%Monkeyweed21> and the Athenians werent around to talk shit
[0:12:24] <SaltyAzteca> You could say they were molded by it
[0:12:25] <+tearsaurther> Just wondering if kratos get double jump
[0:12:26] <+Delenay> maybe thats why kratos left
[0:12:27] <Profmcstevie> EMPIRE
[0:12:27] <%Divryne> You're not Alexander.
[0:12:27] <%tamale_senpai> Wait I though Mass Effect today! Did I misread the schedule?

[0:12:28] <%SovPho> All the way to Ireland
[0:12:28] <%AllenDeadman> WITH PASTTRIES?
[0:12:29] <MelonSouda> The romans took over most of weatern europe
[0:12:30] <F_manS> Alexander is not Greek
[0:12:32] <%CatRidder> and israel
[0:12:32] <Ashecroft> supposedly this is only the 2nd game of 4 in the Norse mythos, from what Ive heard. Which makes no sense to me
[0:12:33] <HaroldDonchee> but muh Greek fire
[0:12:35] <@TheYellowcouch> But never went north!! YEEE
[0:12:35] <%baka_sugoi> BUT MONGOLIA PAT

[0:12:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "You can grow my wheat for me after you're beaten" Roman Empire - Probably
[0:12:47] <General_Terro> if alexander is so great why is he dead
[0:12:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> WHAT ABOUT MONGOLIA
[0:12:50] <draca23> Romans only died because they sucked against Napoleon and refused to work with others.
[0:12:51] <%Mathochism> Alexander made it out to India almost.
[0:12:53] <alrobot2014> can anything beat the mongols?

[0:13:24] <%Ynkubus_> Ghengis Khan got most of Eurasia
[0:13:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> He went to Turkey
[0:13:24] <%RealThiele> nomadic archer badasses
[0:13:25] <%AllenDeadman> Macedonian
[0:13:26] <%polothegreatest> Asterix would kick kratos ass psaSmug
[0:13:27] <%vivaldiva> to austra almost
[0:13:27] <%Mathochism> Mongolian/Turkish steppe tribes, yeah.
[0:13:27] <%Meekest> Genghis went Yes far
[0:13:27] <%Arnoldoaad1> Mongolia was like 4 times the roman empire
[0:13:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> He went very far west
[0:13:30] <MementoImpetus> poland
[0:13:30] <%vivaldiva> austria*
[0:13:33] <%tamale_senpai> He fucked bitches
[0:13:34] <%full_circle> Genghis Denghis

[0:13:36] <+tigerrsz> very far
[0:13:37] <%moonmintparadise> A mix of Mongolian and African Wartribe
[0:13:38] <+Shishi1205> Classic
[0:13:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @nabs96 tales games are pretty self contained, like final fantasy, so you should be good
[0:13:38] <Gorgs7> All the fuck over, biggest empire in all of history @PatStaresAt
[0:13:39] <%Scevda> Genghis was LEGIT
[0:13:39] <Hellarussian> he went at least for like a mile
[0:13:39] <F_manS> Into poland and punked the russians.
[0:13:40] <+ghostfaceninja_> thats not true
[0:13:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Asia to austria
[0:13:40] <%Piemono> Didn't they get into Europe for a bit
[0:13:41] <MelonSouda> Not sure about Genghis. but the mongol empire reached the edge of europe I think?
[0:13:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Mongolia was biggest empire
[0:13:45] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt biggest in history I think
[0:13:47] <%shurtal> recurve bows and shit tons of horses
[0:13:47] <%Fooguwu> Genghis ACCIDENTALLY conquered most of europe with a scouting party
[0:13:48] <%Meekest> He conquered almost all of Asia and Europe
[0:13:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Genghis has his DNA in dudes from New York to Japan
[0:13:53] <Profmcstevie> Fairly far, by population of the planet Genghis had the largest
[0:13:53] <PinionGear> arguing about which mythology has the strongest gods feels like old school fanfiction arguments
[0:13:53] <%AllenDeadman> Genghis fucked a lot
[0:13:53] <bob900000> he fucked a lot
[0:13:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cuz he fucked everyone everywhere he conquered
[0:13:58] <%Ziegsy> Oh like Charlemagne?
[0:13:58] <%RealThiele> 5% of china is him
[0:14:01] <%Bt_Robot> To be fair, Kratos killed Shiva, and shiva is the Superman of India
[0:14:01] <@Ranryu692> well they all had to return home when he died to pick the new leader
[0:14:02] <@TheYellowcouch> You too could be the seed of Genghis
[0:14:03] <%Ynkubus_> His sons immediatley dropped the ball which is funny
[0:14:04] <+rdark_ksu> If you are going to be a big time warlord is dont have multiple shit kids
[0:14:04] <nabs96> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Sweet! Guess this stream will help me decide
[0:14:05] <%boofybaps> Delivered that Ghengis cock
[0:14:07] <kvnnyk> Are you related to genghis khan
[0:14:08] <%baka_sugoi> Gangis FUCKS
[0:14:10] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt Think china all the way west to the atlantic
[0:14:13] <%full_circle> Genghis done had to kill his brother or something
[0:14:17] <+Shishi1205> He impacted the environment by killing people @PatStaresAt
[0:14:18] <%Scevda> same
[0:14:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Genghis Chunghis
[0:14:21] <%AncelDeLambert> it's pretty esoteric
[0:14:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @nabs96 yeah, exactly
[0:14:26] <%boofybaps> Pat is 23% Ghengis
[0:14:32] <$mattynezz> I'm power sure it's Ancestor worship
[0:14:33] <%AncelDeLambert> pretty sure no
[0:14:33] <%Bt_Robot> The Blue Sky
[0:14:35] <%Scevda> animal spiritualism
[0:14:36] <+rdark_ksu> Sky mostly if we being serious
[0:14:39] <%anAngryHamster> Mongolia didn't collapse with Geghis's death. You're thinking of Atilla
[0:14:42] <%CatRidder> NO, the spirts of the land and sky
[0:14:42] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt fun fact nobody knows how he died
[0:14:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Ghengis has a rule where if you were taller than some cart, soldiers were instructed to make you a head shorter
[0:14:47] <@TheYellowcouch> Only if Doc writes it
[0:14:48] <F_manS> Proabably sky god.

[0:14:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> apparently 0.5% of the entire population, or 16 million people
[0:14:54] <%Ynkubus_> The sky itself
[0:14:54] <+JustToWatch> I think Doc is already making that
[0:14:55] <%Dakuu75> Oh, we talking about the Thor design? lol
[0:15:00] <%RealThiele> Hussy attack
[0:15:01] <%Bt_Robot> It's Kratos fighting the concept of a sky

[0:15:16] <%cvp5127> thats fate pat
[0:15:18] <%Ziegsy> Bugs bunny would kill every god

[0:15:30] <%moonmintparadise> Yeah what about Lokis kids tho? Will Atreus bone in a spiritual way and summon two weirdo animals ?
[0:15:31] <xanerts> apparently the mongols were budhist,shamans and islamistic
[0:15:32] <SaltyAzteca> They should make a fighting game based off of Gods Kappa
[0:15:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> MY DEITY WOULD WIN. BECAUSE THEY ARE MINE
[0:15:33] <%Scevda> whats that show with gandhi in highschool?

[0:17:29] <%lucky_icarus> The literal first guy to do wrong
[0:17:30] <%Monkeyweed21> Abel was a bitch he deserved it
[0:17:33] <%Felremi> yea but he had a choice
[0:17:36] <+rdark_ksu> Cain was the first scrub
[0:17:37] <%AllenDeadman> murder is pretty bad, but hey

[0:17:40] <%boofybaps> God knows everything right?
[0:17:40] <@ssjklyco> Cain is a big asshole in Lucifer
[0:17:40] <%cvp5127> god is a dick
[0:17:41] <%tamale_senpai> God made him that way, Kane just a dude and had no choice in the matter.
[0:17:41] <Zero_Jacks> pat vs god ?
[0:17:41] <%full_circle> god's a petty butthole
[0:17:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Abel was a little bitch
[0:17:42] <xanerts> at least cain became immortal
[0:17:42] <%TheHateFish> He did everything wrong but got sick-ass vampire powers out of it, so it worked out in the end

[0:20:32] <reasonance> what do you mean? poop coming out of your ass is GREAT! it means that it's no longer inside you
[0:20:33] <doggieo> It shames the family

[0:21:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> That explains a lot

[0:29:22] <@PeachSaliva> Show feet
[0:29:22] <%YakumoYomi> I got bored with Vesperia after about 40 hours
[0:29:23] <%Mr_Initials> the combat just gets super repetitive

[0:29:29] <%AllenDeadman> understandable
[0:29:30] <%pcn24454> @Mr_Initials The combat is really hit or miss

[0:29:32] <draca23> Vesperia takes about 5 hours to be the best thing ever.
[0:29:33] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, that's fair about Vesperia.
[0:29:35] <%Garthunox> Vesperia SUCKS!
[0:29:36] <randoli_spugoli> I hated vesperias combat and the characters weren't much better
[0:29:40] <+xeromage> whaaaat!
[0:29:40] <%boofybaps> Paige murder the dog please

[0:29:46] <+cvp5127> was xillia good?
[0:29:47] <%Mr_Initials> oh wait I'm thinking of the one before bersaria
[0:29:48] <wiffernubbin> most people can beat Vesperia in like 25 hours.
[0:29:48] <%MrP33Ps> how the hell can I play Star Ocean 2
[0:29:50] <+xendless_xurbia> Symphonia is my goat but all the ports are horrible
[0:29:51] <%Ziegsy> theres a trophy for the zestiria platinum that requires you to finish the game 5 times. Thats... ballsy
[0:29:53] <TheLocalRival> Dude Vesperia is LONG AS SHIT.
[0:29:53] <%MisterRockett> For reference Pat only got far enough in Vespy to meet CAROL. So he only met 4 party members.
[0:29:53] <%Scevda> Show us your not-fucking feet too
[0:29:53] <%RayReborne> Peach on some Feet shit rn LUL
[0:29:53] <+WarbossMetal> Tales of Symphonia was the first popular tales game right?

[0:29:57] <Treasure_Vault> syphilis
[0:29:57] <%greasypete00> symphonia
[0:29:58] <DevinMayCry> Symphonia was only one I finished.

[0:30:01] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[0:30:01] <%JoshManVGH> PS3 tales
[0:30:02] <%KetsuoTaberu> tales of chlamydia LUL
[0:30:02] <+Drega707> Vesper combat is really only good at new game plus
[0:30:03] <artoflec> @cvp5127 yeah Xillia is very good, and the sequel
[0:30:03] <%nanaki_ff14> @Mr_Initials Same at first but... there is a change in the story that ppl remember fondly and that is why we praise it
[0:30:04] <%Dakuu75> ...s'cuse me~
[0:30:04] <jorniev> GRACES F
[0:30:07] <+TrevSmith222> Let's just play Star Ocean 2.  Cmon.
[0:30:07] <Coystick> Asuka go take Rei for a walk pls
[0:30:10] <nabs96> @patstaresat Don't feign ignorance u Tales fanboy
[0:30:12] <%Eldalu> legendia is good too
[0:30:15] <Therusher> I feel like everyone's favorite is their first one and then they get bored of the others
[0:30:15] <Treasure_Vault> Symphonia has a great twist and also a lot of other hours
[0:30:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> Tales of Herpesia
[0:30:16] <%Brokenothello> we need a Star Ocean 2 playthough RIGHT NOW
[0:30:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Tales of Destiny is the Shit and fuck eveyone who says nah
[0:30:17] <@ssjklyco> Symphonia is just basically FF X story
[0:30:18] <TheLocalRival> I’ve put copious hours into Vesperia and it STILL HAS NOT FINISHED
[0:30:19] <%MisterRockett> Xillia and Xillia 2 have the best combat systems.
[0:30:19] <+WarbossMetal> Berseria was Berserk af
[0:30:22] <%Dopamien> Tales of syphilis PogChamp
[0:30:22] <%RealThiele> Tales of Rhianna
[0:30:23] <jorniev> I HAD FUN
[0:30:23] <%Scevda> Brassiere
[0:30:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Berserk
[0:30:24] <DevinMayCry> Fucking Graces F was one of the worst and best experiences ive had trying tales
[0:30:25] <%greasypete00> tales of gonorrhea
[0:30:26] <+drakthebest> Berseria was really good
[0:30:29] <%AllenDeadman> ah yes... Tales of Gonorrhea
[0:30:30] <Coystick> That sounds like underwear
[0:30:30] <+kewlmyc> IT'S JUST BERSERK
[0:30:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> I don't like tales naming conventions
[0:30:36] <+McSoliace> i feel like berseria is kinda rough
[0:30:37] <Treasure_Vault> Tales of games will never give up.
[0:30:38] <PanicSwytch> Grace F is hot garbage  no offense to who like it
[0:30:38] <jorniev> MAGILOU
[0:30:40] <draca23> Berseria fucking SUCKS.
[0:30:41] <jumpyhugs> Symphonia hit me over the head with how Anime the voice acting was
[0:30:41] <%Pappajimbo> Pappajimbo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Getting a new gaming pc. cant wait to do nothing but watch youtube and twitch on it.
[0:30:42] <wiffernubbin> Berseria is vampire lady kills anime jesus
[0:30:43] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u mean berserk?
[0:30:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Tales of Syphylis
[0:30:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Berseria is amazing but the combat is super hit or miss your experience is somewhat common
[0:30:49] <%Mr_Initials> Zestria is the one I dislike
[0:30:51] <%Wulfphelz> The names of other tales games don't hit like vesperia or Symphonia do
[0:30:53] <%JoshManVGH> It's all about the Devil Trigger
[0:30:53] <%MrP33Ps> Yes, slightly delayed
[0:30:53] <thickbass> Way too much backtracking in Berseria
[0:30:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> Tales of Lupusia
[0:30:55] <%Mr_Initials> I totally forgot
[0:30:57] <+cvp5127> were you in manual mode?
[0:30:59] <jorniev> THE SERIES IS ALL OVER THE PLACE
[0:30:59] <+WarbossMetal> thats every tales game Pat
[0:31:00] <%nanaki_ff14> The Story of Beseria is the best part
[0:31:02] <%Kyma1020> floaty?
[0:31:03] <%AgniBrandt> I HATED Zestiria and Berseria combat
[0:31:05] <%MisterRockett> Berseria's combat is iffy, I'll admit.
[0:31:06] <+McSoliace> especially compared to Xillia
[0:31:07] <draca23> Best part of Berseria is when it says, "Yeah, xillia is better, play that"
[0:31:08] <Treasure_Vault> Wonder Chef!
[0:31:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> He goes him talking about hit stop again
[0:31:11] <@TheYellowcouch> maybe I'm just dumb but the combo ssystem they made also seemed really stupid like just mash one button for the strongest combo. idk
[0:31:15] <quietshun> I thought it was fun
[0:31:17] <%JoshManVGH> Velvets Devil Trigger is the shit though
[0:31:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> Tales of Lombussia
[0:31:22] <%Monkeyweed21> yea the system is made for juggles
[0:31:25] <wiffernubbin> LoL baby played on semi-auto
[0:31:30] <%MrP33Ps> I liked the story
[0:31:30] <%kknutson4> Symphonia is still the best
[0:31:34] <artoflec> i dont agree with that at all but sure LUL
[0:31:37] <DevinMayCry> Tales of Ligma
[0:31:37] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:31:40] <%Scevda> I don't know if this one will vary from that much
[0:31:40] <+Captbutt> berseria's combat is literally go crazy go stupid, it gets old
[0:31:40] <+GuildmasterAhnonay> The story kicks ass
[0:31:42] <%MisterRockett> Tales of Bussyria
[0:31:46] <+drakthebest> It's like DMC assist mode
[0:31:47] <+kewlmyc> You're not going to like this combat either then. Hitting enemies doesn't feel "heavy" if that makes any sense.
[0:31:48] <ohno778> casual mode
[0:31:50] <%Mr_Initials> what you really got to do, is play symphonia 2
[0:31:52] <+Vigonept> whyd they make the mode if it sucks ass
[0:31:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> "this Baby didn't play my baby game correctly"
[0:31:52] <quietshun> The game half plays for you
[0:31:52] <draca23> To automated
[0:31:53] <%Kyma1020> That's fair. I noticed you bounce off games that don't feel right with you and that is a fair criticism
[0:31:53] <%nanaki_ff14> Xillia is only goated if you played Xillia 2 to get the full story imo. with 1 by itself is just cool
[0:31:55] <ohno778> YEs
[0:31:56] <%Caped_Eggy> Nah semi auto is fine
[0:31:57] <artoflec> its like assist mode kinda yeah
[0:31:57] <%AllenDeadman> your problem with a lot of games seems to be "it feels too light"
[0:31:57] <%YakumoYomi> Nope. If you don't like the "feel", the manual wouldn't help
[0:31:57] <%athuramn> yes
[0:32:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its really good but the combat is hit or miss its not exclusive to you
[0:32:01] <%KaiserMario> "Manuel"
[0:32:01] <+kewlmyc> No, Manual wouldn't have
[0:32:03] <%RayReborne> semi auto locks you into the targeted enemy and makes you auto run to enemies before an attack goes off
[0:32:05] <$mattynezz> I assume it's like playing Ace Combat with simple controls
[0:32:07] <%Scevda> "Manual is the new normal Pat" :)
[0:32:09] <wiffernubbin> its an assist mode
[0:32:09] <draca23> A little, but not much.
[0:32:11] <+tigerrsz> COPIUM
[0:32:13] <jorniev> DIVINE INDICNATION
[0:32:14] <draca23> Berseria still sucks.
[0:32:17] <%AllenDeadman> eh
[0:32:17] <%Dakuu75> Chat... chat, you're flying too close to the sun~
[0:32:17] <+DanEthier> DanEthier subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:32:21] <+Delenay> makes you run up to enemies as you hit a button
[0:32:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You can trust us Pat Kappa
[0:32:22] <wiffernubbin> hits felt fine.  Not bayo but fine
[0:32:23] <%MisterRockett> I finished Berseria and it's combat system isn't the best, Pat isn't crazy.
[0:32:27] <eco419> Kappa
[0:32:27] <ExpressNode> Bandai Namco gave me a free code because I ordered the Tales of Arise Collector's edition but it said it will be delayed by 10 days.
[0:32:28] <artoflec> Berseria was awesome though but i didnt play as Velvet very much
[0:32:29] <%AllenDeadman> doesn't really... change the impact of the hits
[0:32:34] <%chance_h> I prefer fully automatic
[0:32:34] <ntwinz> Berseria was TRASH
[0:32:35] <AstranDajan> hello , hows It going
[0:32:36] <%Scevda> huh
[0:32:37] <+WarbossMetal> Nah Pats crazy
[0:32:39] <%JoshManVGH> Hits feel bad if you don't exploite elemental weaknesses
[0:32:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> @rayreborne that's part what made me bounce off the arise, can you turn it off?
[0:32:41] <%KaiserMario> Don't worry Pat, it's good you gave it shot
[0:32:43] <Tomschiii> i doubt even berseria is anything noteworthy
[0:32:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat invented Hit sparks in 1996 the before times
[0:32:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> *arise demo
[0:32:52] <%Kyma1020> If the attacks had more weight to it, Berseria would have been better looking back
[0:32:52] <gildor0> i am having alot of fun witth the  combat
[0:32:53] <Coystick> Elmo's feets look so happy up there
[0:32:54] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> @expressnode same and my code didn't work
[0:32:55] <draca23> Its a more simplified xillia, of course it felt better
[0:32:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> He knows this shit
[0:32:56] <quietshun> Berseria combat isn't amazing but it's still fun
[0:32:57] <DevinMayCry> @ExpressNode Thats nice of them to hit you with a code so you can enjoyu it now
[0:32:57] <%Kyma1020> And I love Berseria
[0:32:57] <artoflec> Berseria was definitely not trash when Zestiria exists LUL
[0:32:58] <jorniev> BERSERIA was fun but way too complex
[0:33:00] <+Vigonept> NO
[0:33:04] <%Scevda> If only the crazys of the world were all like Pat's
[0:33:07] <%YakumoYomi> Nah, it's fine Pat. I understand what you mean.
[0:33:07] <+kewlmyc> It's not that deep Pat
[0:33:08] <%PigGuy800> did you solve that controller issue?
[0:33:08] <+Vigonept> DONT I DONT WANT TO SUFFER
[0:33:10] <ChungusQuest> Hey Pat, did you hear about the resolution to the Apple vs Epic saga?
[0:33:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Berseria also lets you play the whole game with your party wearing cowboy hats and moustaches
[0:33:11] <+aaropoll> I get what you mean it's like using the Osiris in DMC
[0:33:11] <Ashecroft> DO IT
[0:33:11] <haitakaa> yeah Berseria is meh
[0:33:14] <%Piemono> I don't really care, you didn't like it, thats all that matters
[0:33:16] <%MisterRockett> I would absolutely love a Pat quick look of Berseria..
[0:33:18] <%AllenDeadman> no I get it, the hits don't have oomph
[0:33:18] <haitakaa> Vesperia is good
[0:33:19] <%RayReborne> @onethousandtomatoes yeah just hit Start in the battle menu in battle or artes menu in main menu
[0:33:21] <DevinMayCry> Theres some crazy shit in this new one mid battle. Bosses have some crazy shit
[0:33:23] <@ssjklyco> YOu can but someone will still say you're wrong because it wan't like that for them.
[0:33:26] <gildor0> this game does that too
[0:33:27] <%Wulfphelz> monkaS
[0:33:27] <+McSoliace> manual feels better but you still likely wouldnt have liked berseria anyway
[0:33:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat landed the first Aerial Raid, don't question him on weapon feel
[0:33:30] <jorniev> IT TOTALLY DOES THAT TOO
[0:33:31] <%AllenDeadman> not the oomph you'd expect from a brawker character
[0:33:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Arent these just JRPGS tho?
[0:33:33] <draca23> The combo videos of Berseria and Zesteria are AWFUL
[0:33:33] <%BoxNavy> hello everybody :)
[0:33:34] <%MisterRockett> ALL Tales games do.
[0:33:34] <ExpressNode> @Raven_In_A_Tree Really? That sucks. Hope you get your game soon too.
[0:33:36] <%DianaTheAscian> Berseria's story is the only reason why I finished
[0:33:38] <+kewlmyc> This game does too. You get cosmetics from Owls
[0:33:44] <%Scevda> I think its the ol japanese bathingsuit costumes and the like
[0:33:44] <bob900000> most costume are dlc
[0:33:45] <%Kyma1020> Yeah you can make everyone goofy
[0:33:47] <%DianaTheAscian> it*
[0:33:50] <%Valdorick> Don't forget rotating and moving dolphin backpacks until it covers your entire party's head.
[0:33:52] <Coystick> Paige don't smell his butt
[0:33:53] <%BoxNavy> bathe him :)
[0:33:53] <ntwinz> All tales games do that Dumny
[0:33:55] <Ashecroft> @PatStaresAt I personally didnt like Berseria for the same reason. The attacks lacked impact
[0:33:55] <jorniev> @kewlmyc Who?
[0:33:55] <DevinMayCry> Maybe Ill go back and play those tales after arise someday
[0:33:56] <+BoBoCatBurger> pretty much every tales games does thart
[0:33:56] <+Vigonept> is the costume shit that uncommon? trials does it too
[0:33:57] <haitakaa> wipe Zangief's ass pat
[0:33:58] <%jackythefrost> @Tomschiii It was made as an apology for how awful Zesteria was and is the most popular game in the franchise since Vesperia
[0:33:58] <%RayReborne> @draca23 you ain't looking at the good ones then
[0:34:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> He was there when Abe Lincoln said  "Royal Guard" in the Theater
[0:34:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Berseria is amazing but the combat is hit or miss with a lot of people this isnt uncommon @PatStaresAt
[0:34:06] <DevinMayCry> Its cool how Tales have good NG+
[0:34:12] <%Divryne> @PatStaresAt You're not crazy I quit Berseria for the same reason.
[0:34:13] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Why is Paige smelling the dog's butt?
[0:34:15] <SaltyAzteca> paaat-uhhh
[0:34:16] <%nanaki_ff14> Its the Story of Beseria that keeps you going through it. a real repemption game after Zestria's story which. I have the collectors of and the DLC.... stilll
[0:34:17] <eco419> LUL
[0:34:30] <%RayReborne> @monkeyweed21 that explains it perfectly
[0:34:33] <benjakirb> express them glands
[0:34:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Right into the dog taint
[0:34:34] <@TheYellowcouch> She needs to confront her fears like you
[0:34:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> why dog smell bad
[0:34:37] <Coystick> STINKY
[0:34:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> Taking full rips
[0:34:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Tell her to stop huffing the dog!
[0:34:45] <artoflec> i mained Eleanor in Berseria, she has a launcher into Aerial Rave that HEALS when you combo with it. How do you top that.
[0:34:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Get that musk
[0:34:47] <+xeromage> even when you have someone ELSE deal with the dog, the stream is derailed.
[0:34:48] <%Scevda> Btw, why do you think that is Pat? about your nose.
[0:34:50] <+Falkdaddu> Sadly Epic and Apple didn't eviscerate each other more in court
[0:34:58] <%Monkeyweed21> @Tomschiii yea Berseria is super great and stands out as one of the few revenge positive stories out there
[0:35:00] <haitakaa> this is practice for Pat when he gets older
[0:35:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> express the glands with your face Paige
[0:35:00] <Tomschiii> @jackythefrost if the whole franchise is only mediocre, being the best isnt really saying much. it looked stereotypical like all of them
[0:35:02] <%BoxNavy> suhmellyyyy
[0:35:02] <xanerts> show dog
[0:35:03] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[0:35:03] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I thought we were done talking about poop.
[0:35:11] <luftraumm1> he's just farting
[0:35:17] <+kewlmyc> What is happening?
[0:35:18] <ohno778> Don't be mean to Zangiefs butthole
[0:35:20] <%KetsuoTaberu> haha poopoo
[0:35:22] <KaironFortressKnight> I'm 15 hours into the game, its fucking good. But also I'm a huge Tales fan. Enjoy the game Pat!
[0:35:25] <kvnnyk> i bet she's smiling
[0:35:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Tasty tasty elmo hair
[0:35:31] <luftraumm1> be kind to the stink
[0:35:31] <%chiazam> Paige are you not ALWAYS sick?
[0:35:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> Why would Apple and Epic hurt eachother, honor amongst theives
[0:35:35] <%KetsuoTaberu> uh oh stinky
[0:35:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat's limbs are short, what more do you want
[0:35:46] <%nanaki_ff14> How far did you get into Beseria? Did you at least get to why the main character is the way she is?
[0:35:47] <Tomschiii> @monkeyweed21 revenge positive?
[0:35:48] <%BoxNavy> if YOU had eaten the big piece of hair we wouldnt have this problem
[0:35:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Berseria's combat is really hit or miss, especially depending on the character you play your opinion isnt uncommon
[0:35:52] <%jackythefrost> @Tomschiii Thats a very broad statement, you could say the same thing about literally any JRPG franchise
[0:35:52] <Coystick> local t-rex defeated by length
[0:35:53] <DevinMayCry> Its paiges problem now cause its coming out the other side
[0:35:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> especially that third leg Kappa
[0:36:00] <%Scevda> Tru
[0:36:00] <%nanaki_ff14> We are!
[0:36:00] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[0:36:03] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, that's true
[0:36:04] <%Mr_Initials> We really are
[0:36:05] <KaironFortressKnight> Well it is
[0:36:05] <gildor0> yeah thats just fandoms nowadays
[0:36:06] <+xendless_xurbia> yep
[0:36:08] <KaironFortressKnight> And we are
[0:36:08] <+Vigonept> THEY SURE ARE
[0:36:11] <Ekaelis> That opinion is also wrong Pat
[0:36:11] <%RayReborne> Pat that's every fandom tho
[0:36:12] <%BoxNavy> you do but go off
[0:36:13] <%Wulfphelz> OMEGALUL
[0:36:13] <bob900000> what happened?
[0:36:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hey Pat Asuka is bad
[0:36:16] <%Monkeyweed21> NO ONE LOVES ZESTERIA
[0:36:16] <%Arnoldoaad1> Well yes
[0:36:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU DO TOO
[0:36:18] <%MisterRockett> Hey I said you were right about Berseria!
[0:36:18] <%AllenDeadman> mhm
[0:36:19] <DevinMayCry> All I know is, when we get to some SaGa content im gonna be that rpg nerd.
[0:36:20] <+Shishi1205> gottem
[0:36:20] <Coystick> Everything I love is garbage
[0:36:20] <ExpressNode> Jesus I'm downloading it now and this game is 40gb on my XSX.

[0:36:21] <%rekinom> w r o n g o p i n i o n
[0:36:21] <+ALazo> met one longstanding fandom, met them all
[0:36:21] <%Eldalu> aww we arent all like that
[0:36:22] <%Valdorick> That's wrong Pat! Only SOME of your opinions are wrong. /smug
[0:36:22] <@ssjklyco> They also never heard of the first game in the series which is funny
[0:36:22] <%jackythefrost> YOUR WRONG PAT

[0:43:25] <%KaiserMario> Yeah, everyone agree on 8, right?
[0:43:30] <draca23> Still say FF3 is worse
[0:43:32] <%sonofthedeepsouth> TACTICS IS ETERNAL
[0:43:32] <+TheBitingIrish> Zestiria's story was ass, but I'm a sucker for fusion combat mechanics
[0:43:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Tales has wildly variable quality and a lot of hit or miss characters or combat systems
[0:43:34] <%nanaki_ff14> FF1 is a classics tho and should be experinced. Fuck 2 tho go to 3
[0:43:34] <$Jaxnos> ff2 gives me a stomach ache
[0:43:35] <%chiazam> Pat THATS STRAIGHT UP NOT TRUE LMAO

[0:43:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Vandal Savage is cool tho
[0:43:52] <Blank9> Zestiria's only plus side though is very sexy twink being your love interest.

[0:45:58] <MyNameIsRasus> the cool thing about the tales of franchise is that every noun in every game is always the worst
[0:45:58] <Teneb0r> A fart as a stand.... Imagine it.

[0:46:22] <%MisterRockett> It really should have been Superman the Animated.
[0:46:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Absolutely read Red Son
[0:46:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Almost literally at the end
[0:46:29] <+cvp5127> watch smallvile LUL
[0:46:30] <%SovPho> red sun superman maybe? idfk

[0:46:32] <%Scevda> did a crown of thorns come out?
[0:46:33] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Red son
[0:46:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Superman is only good in JLU
[0:46:34] <%RayReborne> The perfect hero trope is so bad, it almost never works for me in any story
[0:46:37] <%RetroCop87> The movie ends better than the book
[0:46:37] <%nanaki_ff14> Injustice is my favorite Superman. We actually getting an animated film now
[0:46:38] <+UKOrigin> superman real stinky, too strong, too op, too perfct
[0:46:39] <%Zeikier> more jesus than in the nola-snyder movies? 4Head
[0:46:39] <$mattynezz> ASS is overrated
[0:46:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> where they aren't afraid to make him dumb
[0:46:42] <+ccwettr123> what do you think of Injustice Supes?
[0:46:42] <jorniev> disagre
[0:46:43] <%MisterRockett> Watch the cartoon
[0:46:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Superman vs the Elite or Red son would be better
[0:46:43] <%Zeikier> *nolan
[0:46:43] <%Daxalog> Red Son is fun
[0:46:44] <%CatRidder> pat is thor superman is jesus
[0:46:45] <%KaiserMario> Have you ever read/watched Red Son?
[0:46:50] <%Paperware> I like Clark Kent but I hate Superman
[0:46:52] <+MiloMD> No one talk about superman pls
[0:46:53] <ExpressNode> Are most depictions of superman now is that he is a allegory for Jesus. He even got resurrected
[0:46:54] <DevinMayCry> All Star super man is literally the best one and whoever told you to read it did you a favor cause its the perfet counter every time someone tries to hound you
[0:46:55] <@Spydurman> forget the comics just watch Justice League LUL
[0:46:56] <causewaybob> Why we killing Superman this time?
[0:46:57] <nabs96> @pookiedaexzile Based af take. JL+JLU were fantastic.
[0:46:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Red Son is cool. Cause the sovoet system needed superman to work Kappa
[0:47:00] <MelonSouda> The only super man thing I ever really enjoyed was the smallville, but even that so long ago I can barely remember it
[0:47:00] <%Scevda> eh, its only shazam

[0:47:09] <thelonechris> Billy had it coming
[0:47:09] <scrumbotime> I think the only superman I don't like on SOME level is Injustice's Supes, Injustice Supes is a stupid fucking idiot who murdered children and sent a murderer after ALFRED
[0:47:09] <%MrP33Ps> Fuck them kids
[0:47:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's dark and edgy
[0:47:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> what's your favorite version of Superman
[0:47:11] <@Ranryu692> Shazam can stop him, though
[0:47:12] <%stantheman_97> more so than movie supes?
[0:47:12] <%nanaki_ff14> oh yeah i forgot that part
[0:47:13] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Injustice Supes is logocal

[0:56:15] <+transporterthesequel> YEAH
[0:56:15] <brachydios777> Yep
[0:56:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Griffith is Gut's father?
[0:56:17] <Treasure_Vault> Everything after Luke I am your father SUCKS
[0:56:18] <@ssjklyco> Griffith is guts father noooooo
[0:56:22] <%TheHappyCynic> oh wait guts gets on the bot with Griffith and they get married on the boat
[0:56:23] <%deviljhojho_> its over.
[0:56:25] <jorniev> THE WORST FOR ME IS THAT I CALLED THAT TWIST
[0:56:25] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MOONLIGHT BOY
[0:56:25] <%TheHateFish> Balls so blue they blend in with the sky
[0:56:27] <Blank9> "Yeah... sorry."
[0:56:28] <+transporterthesequel> THAT is exactly it
[0:56:29] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BEING CUTE
[0:56:30] <%strakillias> Muira's probably looking down laughing his ass off at us
[0:56:30] <%AllenDeadman> that tracks
[0:56:31] <%greasypete00> do we know that its the last chapeter? because that letter that young animal published said they were just unsure of what to do atm
[0:56:32] <DevinMayCry> @KeiganOfAstora Other way...
[0:56:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @ssjklyco other way around lol
[0:56:34] <loukemia83> @nanaki_ff14 Just like D&D had GRMMs notes for Winds of Winter right?
[0:56:35] <blackjack8182> Guts is Griffith father
[0:56:36] <ExpressNode> Wow just read an article that Fornite won it's lawsuit against Apple
[0:56:37] <brachydios777> Opposite in this case
[0:56:41] <%AllenDeadman> such a fucking shame man
[0:56:44] <+Rada150> in the end Guts gets transported to the Dark Souls world, he has never been happier
[0:56:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Those blue balls were too big to be called blue balls
[0:56:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> @DevinMayCry Are you actually serious?
[0:56:50] <%RigmaroleHM> I really hope the studio continues it. IT WAS HIS LIFE'S WORK
[0:56:51] <%GalacticaPhanto> It just depresses me that Miura never got to see the end of of his story but he'd love how much it messes us
[0:56:53] <%nanaki_ff14> ouch you hurt me hard there Louke
[0:56:55] <%stantheman_97> it's like if sauron showed up in the middle of return of the king and it just ended
[0:56:57] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> With people sending in pretty personal stuff, I wonder if Pat actually ended up as a phycologist anyway
[0:57:03] <+healnavi> Star Wars would be better if it ended on "Luke I am your father"
[0:57:08] <%ArCielArDor> GODDAMN IT AUTOCORRECT
[0:57:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> 🤔
[0:57:13] <%Dakuu75> that shopw is trippy, lol
[0:57:17] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> WE TALKING ABOUT CENTAURWORLD!?
[0:57:22] <%deviljhojho_> its a series about centaurs
[0:57:23] <+TheBitingIrish> @ExpressNode Wrong, Epic lost all but 1, Apple doesn't have to allow Fortnite back on the app store
[0:57:24] <emoonimoo> I heard it's trippy as fuck but really immserive
[0:57:24] <%GuilKato> CentaurWorld is awesomely screwed up
[0:57:26] <thelonechris> Centaurworld looks like an acid trip
[0:57:28] <%Agami23> you should, its not as creepy as the name implies
[0:57:28] <KaironFortressKnight> In Tales of Arise, Hootle should always be on screen
[0:57:28] <%AllenDeadman> oh that's an acid trip
[0:57:28] <colzack_> It's big good
[0:57:28] <MyNameIsRasus> @KeiganOfAstora not exactly correct but not correctly wrong either
[0:57:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @KeiganOfAstora its complicated and involves demon sacrifices
[0:57:31] <%greasypete00> LUL
[0:57:34] <scrumbotime> The main character is just A Horse.
[0:57:34] <Tennochief> Netflix cartoon
[0:57:36] <Deko_> LUL
[0:57:36] <jorniev> ITS BASICALLY THAT
[0:57:36] <%Dakuu75> That No Where King song is legit great and disturbing
[0:57:39] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[0:57:40] <%Wallabri> Centaurworld is GREAT
[0:57:41] <%Zeikier> oh huh, looks like charlier the unicorn :V
[0:57:42] <%MisterRockett> The weird horse girl in class made a cartoon.
[0:57:45] <%Zeikier> *charlie
[0:57:47] <scrumbotime> A Horse, named Horse.
[0:57:48] <DevinMayCry> @KeiganOfAstora We dont know fully the case, but im not wrong
[0:57:49] <+vaderxyz1970> A place for only the bravest furrys
[0:57:50] <%AllenDeadman> that cartoon is so much fun... but such an acid trip
[0:57:51] <RancidRitson> RancidRitson subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[0:59:11] <%Taisuru> @nanaki_ff14 Oh, eh, that's fine
[0:59:11] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Just like that Aaron Paul meme.
[0:59:12] <DevinMayCry> @nanaki_ff14 I dont mind that
[0:59:16] <%BoxNavy> owned
[0:59:17] <%stantheman_97> LUL

[0:59:37] <ExpressNode> Tales of Suprise
[0:59:43] <%Mattais88> The D stands for Do It Again
[0:59:44] <%Zeikier> the water closet
[0:59:46] <brachydios777> Fixed this time?

[0:59:47] <%FrootusClopootus> burnt fries are better then soggy
[0:59:48] <%Puhff> I liked it
[0:59:49] <RiderSensei> probably a good idea
[0:59:52] <ExpressNode> Or fall into the dog
[0:59:53] <Tracazoid> The dog is still up there laughing at her
[0:59:56] <jorniev> ARISE THIS DICK
[0:59:59] <%RealThiele> paige fell into the well!
[1:00:00] <earthboy2k> so at look at the poop
[1:00:01] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Is that like a regular thing?
[1:00:01] <%Taisuru> You have a toilet at the bottom of the stairs?
[1:00:08] <%nanaki_ff14> Yeah im just scared with Part 6 now that JoJo is mainstream Netflix might kill it
[1:00:25] <L3m0nTwi5t> It's been so long since I've seen Pat live I just tried to skip the BRB lol
[1:00:26] <Blank9> arise chicken, arise
[1:00:45] <DevinMayCry> Netflix doesnt have the power to "kill" jojo
[1:00:47] <%Taisuru> @nanaki_ff14 I think it'll be just fine, Netflix didn't pay to get it created it payed for exclusivity
[1:00:55] <jorniev> @nanaki_ff14 what?
[1:00:58] <DevinMayCry> Yeah
[1:01:00] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Speaking of Jojo, been on the struggle bus to get into it for awhile, does it pick up after season 1?
[1:01:10] <DevinMayCry> Netflix doesnt manufacture Jojo
[1:01:15] <%nanaki_ff14> OSAI;UHDFOIUHAOESUTHLASUIHRDTFGUIAHSERT
[1:01:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> @spartan_kd21 ye
[1:01:27] <%Starotter70> @SPARTAN_KD21 I'd say so
[1:01:27] <%RealThiele> stroked out
[1:01:28] <%Taisuru> @SPARTAN_KD21 Very much yes, season 1 is by far the most dull
[1:01:30] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:01:34] <%rekinom> @SPARTAN_KD21 Yeah, the first season is kind of slow
[1:01:37] <%TheHappyCynic> jojo only gets better after season 1. every season is better than the Las
[1:01:37] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:01:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> s2 is where I got hooked
[1:01:38] <brachydios777> Who are you guys looking forward to seeing the most in GOW Ragnarok? Tyr with me
[1:01:44] <%BoxNavy> s2 is the best one
[1:01:46] <%nanaki_ff14> Yeah but for overseas's idk im old I just have PTSD about anime being ruined over here in NA
[1:02:04] <%MonsterEnvy> @brachydios777 Fenrir biting Tyr's hand off.
[1:02:04] <DevinMayCry> Everyone has their favorite part but no one will say part 1 is their favorite
[1:02:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> s1 is only 9 episodes though so it's not TOO much of a slog
[1:02:14] <%BoxNavy> anime dubs r gud now
[1:02:25] <%bevyrage> david productions are handling the anime, so they've got both a good track record and 5 jojo parts under their belt now @nanaki_ff14
[1:02:27] <@Ranryu692> @nanaki_ff14 a, Netflix is only paying to air it, not to create it. b, JoJo isn't going to get cancelled right before SBR
[1:02:28] <DevinMayCry> They are better on average for sure
[1:02:30] <%RealThiele> man odin is such a prick Tyr was the only nice god to fenrir
[1:02:40] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Okay it feels like that’s the one where it wants you to take it the most seriously. All the other seasons I’ve seen clips of seem like it leans into its shitposty nature @taisuru  @rekinom
[1:03:02] <+Diabetic> Alan Wake 2 is happening with Epic Games.... ugh
[1:03:03] <%MonsterEnvy> @RealThiele Well Odin knew Fenrir was destined to kill him
[1:03:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[1:03:10] <%MonsterEnvy> So he really does not like that dog
[1:03:18] <brachydios777> I love how Tyr is so much taller than Kratos
[1:03:20] <%nanaki_ff14> My fear mongering is slightly calmed down lol yeah David Production has done an amazing job. Just with overseas's distributions I don't trust
[1:03:27] <@Ranryu692> @Diabetic that just means it's going to be in early access for a year and then it'll come to steam
[1:03:31] <experience_share> @Diabetic People still really care about this?
[1:03:36] <ExpressNode> Should I consider making a epic account?
[1:03:36] <%Mattais88> Oh Man, Kratos' sled dog is going to be Fenrir isn't it?
[1:03:40] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @boxnavy I mean there’s no lie here. Gundam dubs these days I feel are a good metric for how far dubs have come in terms of quality
[1:03:41] <%Dopamien> @SPARTAN_KD21 its similar to wrestling, you can take it as seriously as you want or the reverse
[1:03:48] <%Taisuru> @SPARTAN_KD21 Part 2 is a substantial step up and part 3 is where (despite some growing pains) it very much comes into its own as a series.
[1:03:56] <%MonsterEnvy> @Mattais88 Fenrir is his grandson
[1:04:02] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Cool
[1:04:05] <DevinMayCry> Gundam X never dub ever
[1:04:05] <%chance_h> I wish birds were real
[1:04:06] <%MonsterEnvy> As Loki is Fenrir's dad
[1:04:11] <+Diabetic> @experience_share I just don't like that they have millions upon millions made and the Epic Store is still so glitchy and crappy compared to even EA
[1:04:14] <jumpyhugs> @Mattais88 LUL yep, bringer of Ragnarok itself, just pullin a sled
[1:04:43] <+SPARTAN_KD21> @devinmaycry I still want to find the full ZZ Gundam dub. That shit is legendarily bad
[1:04:45] <DevinMayCry> @MonsterEnvy Oh of course. Its a chronos zeus parabel shit all over
[1:04:51] <+Diabetic> @Ranryu692 oh 100% I'll just buy it later, same as the remaster. I honestly wouldn't care if Epic Game Store wasn't so bad
[1:04:52] <%Mattais88> @MonsterEnvy But no one's called him Laufey anywhere, so they could be pulling a twist, where it's just Loki's dog
[1:04:59] <experience_share> @Diabetic Fair but at least it's just another launcher and not a separate platform exclusivity
[1:05:03] <DevinMayCry> I love the japanese gundam voices too much to care for dubs now honestly
[1:05:09] <emil_hunter1> Hope this is good Zesteria kinda turned me off the games
[1:05:14] <%MonsterEnvy> @Mattais88 Laufey is the mother
[1:05:16] <DevinMayCry> Like if chars in any of them I cant listen to dub when I could hear Ikeda
[1:05:21] <%MonsterEnvy> Fey for short
[1:05:37] <blackjack8182> Zesteria was ass but Berseria was great
[1:05:38] <+SPARTAN_KD21> The dubs since at least 79 dub have ranged from solid to really ducking good shockingly @devinmaycry
[1:05:42] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Man Paige must have taken some Damage
[1:05:43] <Blank9> war in the pocket has to be watched dub just to hear all the people trying to voice kids
[1:05:43] <%Mattais88> Must have missed that one
[1:05:44] <%zeroarturia> did not know ZZ had a dub.
[1:05:49] <%Starotter70> @emil_hunter1 Ah man, Zestiria sucks so bad. At least Berseria came out of it
[1:05:53] <+Akizea> @emil_hunter1 its funny cause the game after that is apparently pretty decent
[1:05:56] <Blank9> and the best lines like "WHAT THE HECK IS A GUNDAM"
[1:06:04] <+UltimortalMoth> Berseria was a good apology for Zestiria.
[1:06:09] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Oh god it’s fucking terrible @zeroarturia
[1:06:12] <%alphonseisbest> Wait why is Pat not doing ME3?
[1:06:12] <DevinMayCry> @SPARTAN_KD21 Ive heard them I agree but its just not int he cards to me anymore. Like yakuza dubs now
[1:06:18] <Teneb0r> i hope theres more than six party members. :s
[1:06:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> @alphonseisbest new game
[1:06:29] <@QueequegTheater> Reminder that Cowboy Bebop doesn't belong in any language but English
[1:06:38] <brachydios777> The wall at the end of GOW 4 calls Kratos the name of Loki's dad in norse mythology, right?
[1:06:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> lots of people seem to like it
[1:06:43] <Blank9> I think people consistently don't like Legendia or Zestiria and past that no one knows which tales is better than the other
[1:06:46] <%Starotter70> psaDab
[1:06:50] <%MonsterEnvy> @Teneb0r 12 hours in and still only have 4
[1:06:50] <UnsteadyFunk> Mark Hamil was good as Majima and I'll fight you over this.
[1:06:56] <%alphonseisbest> @OneThousandTomatoes but he  said last night he couldn't get it to work?
[1:06:57] <+SPARTAN_KD21> Like they made the protag who is 14 mind you sounds like a 30 something grown ass man @zeroarturia
[1:07:11] <@QueequegTheater> Matthew Mercer was a better Majima than Mark Hamill
[1:07:14] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> @QueequegTheater i will agree to that take
[1:07:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> @QueequegTheater so no Norio Wakamoto?
[1:07:19] <Blank9> Anime Ja Nai
[1:07:24] <experience_share> 6 is a good party size imo
[1:07:31] <%zeroarturia> @spartan_kd21 who did the dub? I know for the most part Blue ocean studios did a lot of the Gundam dubs and mostly solid.
[1:07:34] <%alphonseisbest> @Blank9 Vespieria is the BEST, this one seems pretty good so far
[1:07:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> then later on Twitter he said he would stream it cause he got it to work @alphonseisbest
[1:07:59] <Teneb0r> i'll admit, Zesteria was bad BUT at least it gave me Bara Tiddy. Not many tales games do that,
[1:08:04] <DevinMayCry> You guys see the past voice actor of gundam in character wishing hathaway wishes? Judea voice actor is screaming at Hathaway for being a shit its awesome
[1:08:07] <%alphonseisbest> @OneThousandTomatoes lame, i wantted to see krogan titty tonight :(
[1:08:10] <@SSaryn> Reminder that no matter what the game, every game has its' fans. Hope you all enjoy Tales of Arise. Maybe idk, maybe another game if you don't
[1:08:12] <%BoxNavy> helloooo
[1:08:13] <KaironFortressKnight> omg he lives

[1:09:31] <KaironFortressKnight> Short is better imo
[1:09:33] <%Puhff> LET'S GET LOUD
[1:09:35] <DevinMayCry> @ChaosedStar Do you know how targeting party works? Just up and down on dpad and if you press X is stays ont he target after a cast, if not it goes back to last target you confirmed after spell
[1:09:37] <+UKOrigin> normal too easy, try moderate
[1:09:37] <%kknutson4> bump up difficulty one
[1:09:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> @QueequegTheater i'll be honest, i was able to entirely dodge Naruto much to my relief lol
[1:09:39] <Teneb0r> Vesperia, Symphonia, Abyss, Xillia 2 all get to hang out at the Cool Kids table.
[1:09:43] <%RealThiele> Vibe on Kreygasm
[1:09:47] <MyNameIsRasus> on by default, as a should
[1:09:48] <%zeroarturia> @spartan_kd21 then it makes sense. I thought that, Victory and X were never gonna get dubs.
[1:09:54] <%MonsterEnvy> normal is fine
[1:09:56] <Blank9> destiny's a cool game for ps1
[1:10:02] <%MonsterEnvy> your score
[1:10:03] <+ArticPath> You can change it at anytime
[1:10:04] <brachydios777> Moderate? not hard?
[1:10:04] <%kknutson4> AP
[1:10:04] <%Scevda> Moderate is the new normal :-)
[1:10:04] <haitakaa> how many special attacks you can do
[1:10:08] <%alphonseisbest> HEALS
[1:10:08] <Blank9> you get more exp and gil for higher difficulty
[1:10:10] <experience_share> Moderate seems good, playing on hard and things feel a little spongy
[1:10:10] <DevinMayCry> @ChaosedStar For example, you hard targeted tank, need to throw a regen on another party member, just tap d pad down, cast cure and bam your target goes back to tank
[1:10:11] <%Axellogic> Supposedly the Dualsense haptics work on PC as well
[1:10:11] <+jofrankii> style meter
[1:10:11] <%Taisuru> Just play normal
[1:10:11] <blackjack8182> I heard normal was too easy
[1:10:11] <%KaiserMario> Hey guys, is Woolie coming back this following week or the next one?
[1:10:12] <WTFOliver> jump on circle seems illegal
[1:10:12] <Blank9> moderate is good to start
[1:10:12] <%Garthunox> they let you learn skills
[1:10:13] <Teneb0r> combat points = TP.
[1:10:13] <%furiousfurioso> if its like the previous games, you spend your score at the end to buy things for new game plus
[1:10:13] <KaironFortressKnight> Score percentage that can increase your Skill Point gain
[1:10:14] <@TheYellowcouch> ah yes. once more.... cp
[1:10:14] <@ssjklyco> Ratings that give you new game + stuff
[1:10:14] <%Taisuru> Stop doing this
[1:10:15] <MyNameIsRasus> score to buy new game + shit
[1:10:15] <+kewlmyc> CP is the amount you can heal in this game
[1:10:16] <Blank9> you can change when you want
[1:10:17] <%alphonseisbest> CP = HEALS
[1:10:20] <%RetroCop87> skill currency I think
[1:10:21] <ExpressNode> @Teneb0r Would be cool if they ported most of those to PC
[1:10:23] <%MonsterEnvy> yesw
[1:10:23] <gildor0> it's score for combos you get more xp
[1:10:24] <jtsoppy137> yes
[1:10:25] <gildor0> yes
[1:10:26] <KaironFortressKnight> Anytime yes
[1:10:26] <Deko_> moderate is not too bad and you can change it
[1:10:29] <%AgniBrandt> You can adjust difficulty all you wanr
[1:10:29] <%kknutson4> yep
[1:10:30] <%alphonseisbest> cp = HEALS
[1:10:30] <+Rofiarf> yes
[1:10:30] <%toastybites> Why tf is camera speed in stars and not just a normal bar
[1:10:30] <%MisterRockett> At the end of the game you get to cash them for New Game+ options I think.
[1:10:31] <+skye_mm> you can change it anytime
[1:10:31] <%MonsterEnvy> whever you want
[1:10:31] <Profmcstevie> Freely
[1:10:33] <gildor0> you can change anytime
[1:10:33] <LordOfThePoultry> yes
[1:10:33] <%Puhff> Mmmm CP
[1:10:33] <+ALazo> yeah, looks like you can change it whenever
[1:10:33] <%RonaldMcDownload> Usually yes, you can change
[1:10:35] <+UKOrigin> yeah can change in game, not too much of a big deal :
[1:10:37] <+drakthebest> You can change whenever you want yeah
[1:10:37] <%Garthunox> changeable anytime yes
[1:10:37] <%BoxNavy> Story
[1:10:37] <Blank9> anytime, even right before a boss
[1:10:38] <ChaosedStar> @BoxNavy  @QueequegTheater @DevinMayCry guess i just need practice cause i swear it feels like it sometimes feels like up n down arent very responsive
[1:10:40] <@goose_attack_almanac> Japanese games need to stop labeling point systems with the acronym CP
[1:10:40] <KaironFortressKnight> fifth is unlocable
[1:10:41] <@SSaryn> https://steamcommunity.com/app/740130/discussions/0/3042733612658968514/ For those interested in getting Arise and wanting to know why controller doesn't work, it right here.
[1:10:42] <%Scevda> Journalist mode
[1:10:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> destiny is for ps1? no wonder nobody knew it
[1:10:44] <KaironFortressKnight> unlockable*
[1:10:44] <blackjack8182> Jump being on circle is evil
[1:10:46] <Teneb0r> Unknown is unlocked later.
[1:10:47] <%alphonseisbest> NO THATS good
[1:10:48] <ExpressNode> Yeah its pretty much a stable to change the difficulty on the fly
[1:10:48] <%Monkeyweed21> 4 for now
[1:10:49] <+TheBitingIrish> wot
[1:10:51] <%JoshManVGH> It can be changed
[1:10:53] <AoiRob> easiest mode is called story mode lmao
[1:10:54] <%RayReborne> difficulty can be changed anytime
[1:10:54] <doggieo> Mod
[1:10:56] <ExpressNode> staple
[1:10:57] <@SSaryn> Also don't play on Hard, Hard is essentially NG+.
[1:10:57] <%alphonseisbest> yay
[1:10:58] <%RayReborne> yeah
[1:10:58] <blackjack8182> Moderate
[1:10:58] <reasonance> you usually unlock crazy bullshit chaos mode later in these games
[1:11:00] <@ssjklyco> Normal is fine
[1:11:01] <brachydios777> Never go Legendary
[1:11:01] <%Puhff> Literally once
[1:11:03] <+Akizea> playing on hard rn, lowkey kinda rough
[1:11:06] <LordOfThePoultry> more get unlocked
[1:11:06] <@QueequegTheater> @SveriSageAdvice That's fair.  But Steve Blum tho
[1:11:08] <%MonsterEnvy> long
[1:11:09] <KaironFortressKnight> Short
[1:11:10] <%RealThiele> ill quit!
[1:11:12] <ChaosedStar> Short
[1:11:13] <experience_share> Short
[1:11:15] <%AgniBrandt> Short
[1:11:15] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Moderate is the new Normal
[1:11:16] <WTFOliver> feels easier to go itno the dodge with short
[1:11:18] <MyNameIsRasus> long long man
[1:11:18] <Xiangchang> Hardcore is the new Normal, right? Huehue.
[1:11:18] <%alphonseisbest> @SSaryn JP started on hard, hes doing fine#
[1:11:18] <@ssjklyco> Short
[1:11:18] <%AgniBrandt> Definitely short
[1:11:20] <Blank9> yeah moderate is probably the best start
[1:11:20] <%AllenDeadman> sounds good
[1:11:21] <PanicSwytch> Both
[1:11:24] <DevinMayCry> @ChaosedStar Im not sure why they wouldnt be responsive. In my experience they work instantly. If you are holding L1 or R1 you will cycle through tank enminity instead of party
[1:11:24] <%mikesapartment> one is long one is short
[1:11:25] <+ArticPath> short. actions que up if you mash
[1:11:25] <thefishofwar> short is better
[1:11:25] <%RayReborne> short, long will buffer i puts like dark souls
[1:11:26] <%AllenDeadman> short
[1:11:27] <%Puhff> Recommend deez nuts
[1:11:30] <experience_share> Long had me accidentally buffering inputs
[1:11:32] <%furiousfurioso> OH I DIDNT KNOW THAT
[1:11:34] <@SSaryn> Short.
[1:11:37] <%Scevda> DS ROLLS
[1:11:38] <+ALazo> you may find yourself pressing a button twice and getting stuck doing a skill twice, though
[1:11:39] <%AllenDeadman> short imo is better but it's up to you
[1:11:42] <gildor0> long screwed with my doge rolls
[1:11:44] <DevinMayCry> WHAT
[1:11:44] <blackjack8182> Short
[1:11:45] <+ALazo> with a little mash
[1:11:46] <Deko_> oh so thats why i couldnt dodge shit
[1:11:48] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Short is DMC, Long is Dark Souls
[1:11:49] <%TheHateFish> Journalist, Casual, Regular Person, Weeb, Unlockable: ADVANCED WEEB+
[1:11:50] <DevinMayCry> WHY DID IT DEFAULT LONG THEN
[1:11:51] <%BoxNavy> its such a cool feature
[1:11:56] <Teneb0r> If a buff guy doesnt join my party, im not buying this game. Flat out. That decides my purchase.
[1:11:58] <RyuuAoi> What I miss?! NMH?
[1:12:03] <DevinMayCry> The dumb game got me lol
[1:12:04] <%AllenDeadman> it SURE IS
[1:12:06] <@SSaryn> Helps with games like Arise and Scarlet Nexus.
[1:12:08] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> That's an MK11 setting.
[1:12:13] <ChaosedStar> @DevinMayCry That must be it. I think im so used to tanking and having things held a lot from how easy rotations are now.
[1:12:15] <%BoxNavy> @RyuuAoi hes doing it next week
[1:12:16] <brachydios777> This game is suppose to look quite good, yes?
[1:12:18] <AoiRob> uh oh
[1:12:18] <%Scevda> Ruined!@
[1:12:19] <+TheBitingIrish> Anti-aliasing doodSick
[1:12:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> @QueequegTheater i think the only time i've heard Steve Blum was in Cowboy Bebop, i generally don't listen to english dubs unless i'm super into it
[1:12:20] <+cvp5127> turn off motion blur
[1:12:24] <@TheYellowcouch> only horizontal sync
[1:12:24] <%Starotter70> The timer monkaS
[1:12:26] <scrumbotime> Pat Settings With
[1:12:29] <+UKOrigin> LOL
[1:12:29] <%alphonseisbest> why is V sync bad?
[1:12:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> looks fine to us
[1:12:30] <@Ranryu692> "That seems good to me! Oh no!"
[1:12:40] <%AllenDeadman> uh
[1:12:41] <%BoxNavy> hello
[1:12:42] <majindusto> NO VERTICAL BELIEF
[1:12:43] <RyuuAoi> @boxnavy He's a coward. He should do Sonic Unleashed.
[1:12:44] <@SSaryn> I can't believe Pat shit his ass on chat
[1:12:46] <%stantheman_97> we now do horizontal split
[1:12:53] <@QueequegTheater> @SveriSageAdvice Go listen to Kill La Kill's opening scene in the dub and tell me that actor wasn't born to be Gamagoori
[1:12:53] <%chance_h> Why would you do this to us pat?
[1:12:58] <haitakaa> pat is vertically challenged
[1:13:00] <%RealThiele> What a professional
[1:13:01] <%Taisuru> SHOW BABY
[1:13:03] <%AllenDeadman> I am baby, why borderless?
[1:13:04] <TioXyco> that's why you're so short, now everything makes sense
[1:13:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh that's why he's so short
[1:13:06] <KaironFortressKnight> You aint going nowhere says Zangief
[1:13:08] <%asgard147> psaDogchamp my cable......zzzzzz
[1:13:10] <blackjack8182> Good job
[1:13:11] <@QueequegTheater> PUT HIM ON YOUR LAP
[1:13:12] <DevinMayCry> @ChaosedStar When I heal on controller up and down just goes through party list instantly as I tap. To the point I can tap the exact times needed to go from my self to another player on the list depending
[1:13:14] <Teneb0r> Watch out for the "fatigue" meter! :s
[1:13:17] <ChaosedStar> ChaosedStar gifted a Tier 1 sub to DevinMayCry! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[1:13:18] <@Ranryu692> Pat views all things vertical as his enemy

[1:13:37] <%AgniBrandt> Hey Pat, some people have reported having issues with the dodge feeling slow. Not sure if you'll need this, but that can be fixed by going into the controller config, Battle tab, Evade/Dodge, and change it from a full pull to a soft pull (not both)

[1:14:09] <%DevinMayCry> @ChaosedStar Thanks man. I hope it works out a way cause it is doable but its unique compared to tanking and DPSing. Especially with the "soft targeting" system I mentioned

[1:20:04] <%Kurgash> The bad guys are actually the good guys preventing the actual bad guys from rising to power
[1:20:06] <%YakumoYomi> "Unable to feel pain" is a quick way to wind up dead
[1:20:06] <gildor0> yeah that would get you killed real fast
[1:20:08] <%Meekest> The reddits?
[1:20:08] <%AllenDeadman> amnesia fucked up his pain sensation I guess?
[1:20:09] <Yakobro> yeah one piece had that lol
[1:20:10] <%JoshManVGH> That's why he asked the child if it looked ghat bad
[1:20:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> ok so I was afk how does this man see

[1:20:12] <%anAngryHamster> He can't eat
[1:20:13] <blackjack8182> He feels no pain?
[1:20:13] <%hamborgini> what's worse: can't feel pain, or can't feel fear?
[1:20:13] <%walternatorz> have they addressed how he eats? I haven't been paying attention

[1:20:18] <+ghostfaceninja_> animals evolved pain for a reason
[1:20:18] <RyuuAoi> Oh like that James Bind villain. ..
[1:20:19] <+SuperOffensiveStudios> Finally seeing Pat play Kingdom Hearts on stream...... as Riku in a gimp mask no less........
[1:20:19] <%strakillias> Is the helmet there to hide your face until character creation or something?
[1:20:20] <Happydisaster> those racist dahnans:(
[1:20:20] <Bustahhwulf> its like the berserk armor but natural Kappa
[1:20:26] <%TIME_PUNCHER> no pain disease causes people to scratch their eyes as infants
[1:20:27] <%KineticZen> A lot of those people don't survive childhood
[1:20:27] <Teneb0r> Dannon yogur has fruit on the bottom doc! FRUIT. ON. THE. BOTTOM.
[1:20:28] <haitakaa> you can't feel the urge to go to the bathroom

[1:20:32] <Tennochief> remember how people hated on Lyse for saying that?
[1:20:33] <brachydios777> Aliens invades fantasy world is a concept I don't see often. Jenova in FF7 technically
[1:20:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> oof
[1:20:36] <@QueequegTheater> They die as children
[1:20:38] <+ProfessorMorrigan> monkaS

[1:20:41] <jtsoppy137> Burn in the shower?
[1:20:42] <%DevinMayCry> Cant you take cold showers either way?
[1:20:43] <%asgard147> I hope they go into it like that in this game
[1:20:44] <%MisterRockett> They should just take cold showers.
[1:20:44] <%RealThiele> chewing would be terrifying too
[1:20:44] <%Reveresao> There was a episode of House about a lady that could not feel pain
[1:20:45] <jumpyhugs> also stepping on things and getting infected cuts
[1:20:45] <ChaosedStar> wouldnt cold showers be better at that point?
[1:20:45] <@goose_attack_almanac> treat that wound through the cape
[1:20:45] <+balkonas1> How’s the game so far guys? Is Pat liking it?
[1:20:46] <RyuuAoi> Scalding skin.
[1:20:46] <HaroldDonchee> that and chewing
[1:20:47] <blewbeary> cant they just take cold baths?
[1:20:48] <%AllenDeadman> no yeah, not feeling pain is fucking dangerous
[1:20:49] <%GuilKato> they also may not know when they need to use the toilet
[1:20:50] <%toastybites> colder showers problem solved
[1:20:51] <%RayReborne> Cold showers for life I guess
[1:20:52] <Quinnotetiquan> @PatStaresAt People with that disability dont live very long
[1:20:53] <ChungusQuest> They often have super fucked up mouths and fingers because they chewed the shit out of themselves as babies
[1:20:54] <Tomschiii> Just put it on neutral
[1:20:54] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt And then they are truly clean
[1:20:58] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> You can never walk barefoot outside either
[1:21:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Just keep the knob in the middle then???
[1:21:00] <A_Cat_Herder> If I couldn't feel pain I would absolutely be one of those people who takes ice baths
[1:21:00] <%shurtal> Hey Travis Touchdown
[1:21:03] <RyuuAoi> Chew your tongue off. Ouch.
[1:21:04] <%JokerNewby> plot twist it's noc under that mask
[1:21:09] <+ghostfaceninja_> so how does he see? how does he eat?
[1:21:12] <%DevinMayCry> Like you could bleed out from easily fixable shit
[1:21:16] <%RonaldMcDownload> We'll solve this through incremental change!  What could go wrong?
[1:21:16] <UnsteadyFunk> What if that's just some fancy chamber pot he saw lying around and decided to put it on his head because he thought it looked cool.
[1:21:21] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL

[1:25:56] <%Pappajimbo> maybecrappy terraforming
[1:25:58] <haitakaa> symphonia has a similar premise
[1:26:00] <Blank9> the most evil
[1:26:03] <%GarbageNirvana> It's always the Tales games that deal with more fucked up themes that seem more interesting to me
[1:26:04] <jorniev> this is some warhmmer shit
[1:26:05] <%KineticZen> Maybe don't fight back as emaciated, starved peasant laborers vs guys in full plate with greatswords
[1:26:06] <blackjack8182> The back down
[1:26:10] <RyuuAoi> Pat Will (Not) Play Hatred
[1:26:11] <%deviljhojho_> wait, invading forces have a tendency to abuse natives? how come no one told me of this
[1:26:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Like Berseria and now this
[1:26:19] <@QueequegTheater> I can see a line on your television Pat
[1:26:22] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Controllers work easily now ?
[1:26:26] <%tank7013> It really feels like they're farming pain for psycho power like fucking M. Bison
[1:26:32] <%RayReborne> FOCK PILLOWS
[1:26:34] <%deviljhojho_> 4 or 6
[1:26:34] <MyNameIsRasus> berseria's situation went dire real quick too
[1:26:35] <ChaosedStar> Nice ROCK pillow
[1:26:36] <%RayReborne> rock
[1:26:38] <@goose_attack_almanac> is that a rock
[1:26:38] <Teneb0r> oooo I hope the final boss is Genis who turned evil and this was Symphonia the whole time...
[1:26:38] <+king_of_beggars> Incel talk.
[1:26:38] <+xendless_xurbia> nice brick pillow
[1:26:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> THE PILLOW WAS A ROCK
[1:26:43] <ChungusQuest> were those bricks for pillows?
[1:26:44] <%charp35> Why even use the rock as a pillow?
[1:26:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Was that a rock as a pillow?
[1:26:46] <%deviljhojho_> really? on the rocks?
[1:26:47] <+fetrigon> ROCK PILLOW
[1:26:50] <%Deft_Thought> He looks cooler with the mask on
[1:26:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> I like fock pillows better
[1:26:53] <+jbfelder> @PatStaresAt  You can't change full screen res lol
[1:26:53] <%deviljhojho_> wh
[1:26:54] <scrumbotime> Pain Farming
[1:26:54] <@QueequegTheater> Does the pillow being a rock even matter with that mask
[1:26:55] <+cvp5127> LUL
[1:26:55] <%Wallabri> sleeping in a whole-head metal mask would be SO UNCOMFY
[1:26:56] <%Scevda> and now for TRAIN
[1:26:57] <%Starotter70> REST
[1:26:58] <@goose_attack_almanac> that was a little jarring
[1:27:00] <%deviljhojho_> bit of soundtrack dissonance there
[1:27:01] <%pcn24454> Better than nothing
[1:27:01] <ChaosedStar> EXAMINE PILLOWS
[1:27:02] <%Starotter70> psaDogchamp
[1:27:03] <KaironFortressKnight> Guys he has a metal helmet he can't remove, the rock pillow aint a big deal
[1:27:04] <%DevinMayCry> Another day another... not dollar
[1:27:10] <%blastyoboots> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid why do you need a soft pillow when you're locked in a metal helmet
[1:27:11] <RyuuAoi> GO TO WORK, PAT
[1:27:13] <%baronouroboros> wage work simulator 2021? :O
[1:27:16] <Blank9> he's sleeping in an iron mask so that's already gotta be terrible
[1:27:16] <skeletonkingofmanlets> why does the music slow down sometimes?
[1:27:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> I wish you could zoom out
[1:27:25] <MyNameIsRasus> QUICK MATHS
[1:27:31] <%KetsuoTaberu> SO NICE

[1:27:36] <neon_z1> Yeaaaaaaaah
[1:27:39] <%MonsterEnvy> half speed
[1:27:44] <brachydios777> Oof framerate
[1:27:45] <%DevinMayCry> People saying why would you want a not rock when have metal mask. And thats cause your metal mask hitting a rock is way worse than a pillow on mask
[1:27:46] <@QueequegTheater> Screenshot mode
[1:27:46] <+fetrigon> jesus
[1:27:47] <%Kurgash> How does he breathe with that on…?
[1:27:48] <ChungusQuest> no thanks frames per second
[1:27:51] <notapolack> You know the worst part about being a slave? They make you work hard but they don't pay you or let you go...
[1:27:52] <Tennochief> I wish my shit pc could run this game at bare minimum
[1:27:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Except I'm watching this on a 1080P TV so I can't tell for shit
[1:27:54] <Loopersum> that 8K Nintendo Switch huh
[1:27:55] <ChaosedStar> Time to go work at fire Amazon
[1:27:55] <+Delenay> didnt look any different on our side so yeah, f that
[1:27:56] <Teneb0r> Slaves to the algorithm. Just like Youtube. Mine for views!
[1:27:57] <%Deft_Thought> Frames running at Bad-per-second
[1:27:57] <%RealThiele> 4k for 30fps
[1:27:59] <%hamborgini> need to see all the pores on that anime boy
[1:28:01] <%DevinMayCry> Imagine your mask fucking ringing when your head turns mid sleep
[1:28:02] <Blank9> the mask is open at the bottom
[1:28:02] <%baronouroboros> @greencapps nmh3?
[1:28:07] <%AllenDeadman> me ovr here watching at 144p
[1:28:09] <MyNameIsRasus> This runs at 60 even in the PS4, i was real surprised
[1:28:12] <%Starotter70> @Tennochief NotLikeThis
[1:28:14] <Blank9> since you can see the chin and hair
[1:28:23] <%furiousfurioso> correct
[1:28:23] <%RayReborne> real answer isn't here yet
[1:28:23] <%Scevda> You'll see @PatStaresAt
[1:28:24] <%deviljhojho_> hmmmm
[1:28:24] <Teneb0r> Its all a huge troll.
[1:28:25] <@goose_attack_almanac> these evil guys with their kendo sticks
[1:28:26] <+DragonArt07> the game explains it
[1:28:26] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Still living that 1080p life
[1:28:27] <+cvp5127> For fun
[1:28:27] <haitakaa> LUL
[1:28:28] <TheHeroAppears> what else do you do with fuel LUL
[1:28:29] <%MisterRockett> HRRRM
[1:28:30] <%RayReborne> oo
[1:28:32] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[1:28:32] <madmat21183> Magic fire
[1:28:33] <%DevinMayCry> That sounds pretty anime Pat
[1:28:33] <KaironFortressKnight> Oh no its Queen Beryl
[1:28:34] <%alphonseisbest> someone watching on 480p looks the same to me Cap Kappa
[1:28:37] <RyuuAoi> Pat (Will) Not Be Perfectly Calibrated
[1:28:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe to waste resources so there's no rebellion?
[1:28:39] <%tank7013> Yea like fuckin' psycho power
[1:28:39] <%RealThiele> doom
[1:28:39] <%alphonseisbest> :)
[1:28:40] <%hamborgini> hmmmm who can say
[1:28:40] <%HiroTSK5> SO it's like Tales of Symphonia
[1:28:40] <circular7> 2020Suspicious
[1:28:41] <koffeemancer> ya got it
[1:28:43] <ChaosedStar> Otherwise fuel prices would drop to excess amounts
[1:28:43] <%polothegreatest> its about a message, pat
[1:28:45] <%JoshManVGH> Beat up children to power space cars?
[1:28:45] <+Delenay> sounds like symphonia stuff
[1:28:46] <Teneb0r> Dig up those DINOSAURS!
[1:28:46] <GilliamYaeger> Maybe they're mining smog
[1:28:47] <iheartmota> is this your first tales game?
[1:28:47] <Reanimator83> Pretty much
[1:28:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt literal blood diamonds
[1:28:48] <%KineticZen> Nice invisible wall there
[1:28:49] <%MisterRockett> They're mining The Darkness
[1:28:49] <%Scevda> awoooo
[1:28:50] <%hairtoday> literal misery farming
[1:28:53] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @PatStaresAt Spite Slavery?
[1:28:54] <%DevinMayCry> Upshot. No home village to burn down at start of game
[1:28:54] <experience_share> Working them to death for the sake of working them to death'
[1:28:55] <ChaosedStar> Gotta manufacture scarcity
[1:28:56] <%KetsuoTaberu> Wtf do you think this is, some sort of anime?
[1:28:56] <%Qsmash_> "We enslaved them. You know, as a joke."
[1:28:57] <Blank9> tales loves slavery stories
[1:29:00] <iheartmota> seems you know a lot about tales lore
[1:29:00] <%DevinMayCry> Already on fire
[1:29:02] <%SpaceHobo55> The Arisers
[1:29:03] <+ALazo> your village is already on fire
[1:29:05] <%MisterRockett> "My village was on fire from the start"
[1:29:06] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Why use coal, when you can use the limitless source of human suffering?
[1:29:07] <HaroldDonchee> literally just evil. no reason for advanced aliens to use slave labor instead of killing everyone
[1:29:07] <+RoByte2> "You gonna stand there and pretend you can't hear the planet crying out in pain? I know you can!"
[1:29:09] <ChungusQuest> efficient!
[1:29:10] <%KineticZen> Can't burn down your village if it's perpetually aflame
[1:29:11] <@QueequegTheater> Why does this game look like Borderlands 2
[1:29:11] <TheHeroAppears> My village is the final dungeon would be the coolest thing
[1:29:11] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> More Fire
[1:29:14] <Treasure_Vault> That actually saves a lot of JRPG time
[1:29:14] <%Taisuru> THE FIRE IS ON FIRE
[1:29:14] <Tennochief> yes
[1:29:14] <i_chevalier> Careful Pat, don't dig to deep, you'll ruin the story writing
[1:29:16] <Zombrocom> They are force making global warming
[1:29:18] <%MisterRockett> I love the fact that there are just constant burning fires no one seems to be worried about.
[1:29:19] <Hoaxfish> "I went on a quest out of town, but my village was fixed when I came back"
[1:29:23] <%Wallabri> no two villages are not on fire
[1:29:24] <draca23> Like Symphonia. Your starting village is next to a nazi camp
[1:29:24] <%JoshManVGH> Push the double sized train!
[1:29:25] <scrumbotime> PUSHING THE TRAIN????? PUSHING A TRAAAAIN?
[1:29:25] <%DevinMayCry> "Oh no they built up my community just to burn it again"
[1:29:26] <Blank9> watch out, you'll come back to your village NOT on fire and be sorry
[1:29:26] <haitakaa> push this train
[1:29:28] <Profmcstevie> It can't have a dire home destroying moment, I have no home
[1:29:29] <%AllenDeadman> I mena they could
[1:29:30] <%alphonseisbest> @QueequegTheater same engine
[1:29:31] <Treasure_Vault> That might be brilliant. Start the game with hundred of years of fire  town
[1:29:31] <+JustToWatch> Sephiroth shows up and builds and idyllic hamlet
[1:29:32] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Anime
[1:29:32] <Quinnotetiquan> my village is #1
[1:29:37] <RyuuAoi> Slavery
[1:29:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> it's anime now
[1:29:38] <notapolack> you know the other bad part of being a slave? the hours.
[1:29:40] <%moonmintparadise> oh wow they have to push it ???
[1:29:42] <%Deft_Thought> ATAB
[1:29:42] <%RayReborne> not the same train pat
[1:29:45] <@TheYellowcouch> This is how the blood diamonds get made
[1:29:45] <%DevinMayCry> Yeah freight duty is pushing the train lol
[1:29:47] <YeeZaurus> kersplat
[1:29:48] <madmat21183> Its Magic fire, they use the embedded crystal from there hands to mine life essence from the slaves to fuel magic stuff
[1:29:49] <%Deft_Thought> All Trains Are Bastards
[1:29:51] <%KineticZen> Hell of a shot
[1:29:51] <%baronouroboros> oh wow, this is a misery farm
[1:29:52] <Blank9> they have such cool armor
[1:29:52] <%YakumoYomi> @Blank9 NotLikeThis

[1:45:33] <TheFramedWarlock> Warhammer 40K
[1:45:35] <+Doctor_Stew> All of the power armor with none of the power?
[1:45:37] <williamcvolk> @i_chevalier I know, right? It's really checking off the checklist of boring video game/anime things. It even has a low start-to-crate time

[1:45:39] <%RealThiele> SPES MRIN

[1:47:39] <%KineticZen> artès
[1:47:40] <haitakaa> can't wait to hear DEMON FANG
[1:47:41] <+matf8> how did he beat him with a sword made of almost entirely rust?
[1:47:42] <topiodonk> tales nerds, i only have a ps4 and pc, is vesperia a good one to try the series?
[1:47:44] <jorniev> KILLED HIM WITH A BLUNT SWORD WHAT A BALLER
[1:47:44] <+Raspada_Ryner> @PatStaresAt you can adjust how much the camera sticks on the target in the options
[1:47:44] <+curse85> combos as fun as they look?
[1:47:45] <+kumaprime> the combat feels really good in this game
[1:47:46] <%Deft_Thought> Pat stabbed him in the dick, the only unarmored section of their suit
[1:47:46] <%pcn24454> @ChungusQuest Not yet. Still in tutorial mode.
[1:47:49] <i_chevalier> @robosqueeb if only

[1:48:01] <%alphonseisbest> @topiodonk one of the best
[1:48:02] <RyuuAoi> How do you feel about that battle system, Pat?
[1:48:02] <kinkade_77> DOUBLE DEMON FANG
[1:48:03] <SaltyAzteca> IM THE PROTAGONIST! I BELIEVE IN MYSELF
[1:48:06] <MyNameIsRasus> combos are real fun, specially with more party members
[1:48:09] <%tank7013> Did the racist slaver just compliment you?
[1:48:10] <jorniev> THE ZUEGLE
[1:48:10] <Qu1ckyyy> @Qu1ckyyy It's the first Tales game I've seen, don't they get tiring after a while?
[1:48:12] <blackjack8182> You’ll never make it
[1:48:19] <AoiRob> jammin
[1:48:21] <scrumbotime> Wouldn't it suck if he turned out to be one of the space people, meaning the entire rebellions success would be due to not even the slaves
[1:48:21] <%RayReborne> Sonic thrust!
[1:48:21] <%RealThiele> good zoog
[1:48:22] <%Scevda> @SaltyAzteca ooooh he believes in himself ooooh
[1:48:25] <%DevinMayCry> @Alzero83 I said that wrong. I should have emphasized its a weird button because of that not that you cant change it.
[1:48:26] <+ALazo> dammit pat don't you know you can't defeat them
[1:48:27] <%jackythefrost> @topiodonk Vesperia is pretty old. Berseria is a better pick if you wanna start with something more modern
[1:48:32] <Frogwash> So uh, I'm guessing the health is under pat?
[1:48:36] <%Rumbutt> no health gauge cause you don't feel pain so can't tell how fucked up you are?
[1:48:37] <Blank9> don't worry you can't feel pain that means you're invincible
[1:48:39] <UnsteadyFunk> The animations are pretty good
[1:48:42] <@QueequegTheater> God that juggle is so jank
[1:48:46] <%alphonseisbest> @Qu1ckyyy just becomes white noise after a while
[1:48:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DEMON FANG. DEMON FANG
[1:48:52] <%Scevda> i think its not there for tutorial @Frogwash
[1:48:52] <Blank9> nah just tutorials have no health
[1:48:53] <sun312772> Main character poser activate
[1:48:53] <AoiRob> can you hard lock?
[1:48:54] <%Mattais88> Loving that violin
[1:48:54] <%Rumbutt> @Frogwash that's stamina
[1:48:55] <haitakaa> also your attack counter resets in the air so you can do three more basic attacks
[1:48:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DAMN I MUST BE A GENIUS
[1:48:58] <%Afterman_> these are all tutorial fights hp bar shows up later
[1:48:58] <%DevinMayCry> @Alzero83 I meant to say it makes sense its on R1 is all by default. I found it weird too at first
[1:48:59] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Is Swallow Blade your new party trick
[1:48:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DOUBLE DEMON FANG
[1:49:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> just practice the dodge I guess
[1:49:03] <MyNameIsRasus> tutorials have no health
[1:49:05] <KaironFortressKnight> Dodging into attacks makes timing easier
[1:49:07] <%alphonseisbest> @Frogwash nah Tutorial, he has infinte health right now
[1:49:08] <%athuramn> it's very relaxed in timing
[1:49:13] <jorniev> @AlteisenReiseZ i love that shit
[1:49:13] <%RayReborne> not jank, Pat is just slow at hit button Kappa
[1:49:15] <%Scevda> TOTSUGEKI
[1:49:15] <i_chevalier> it like this game copied FF7 remake.
[1:49:18] <TioXyco> did he just say "RUNESCAPE" ?
[1:49:20] <gildor0> thats how many artes you can use
[1:49:20] <HaroldDonchee> this music is kinda rad actually
[1:49:22] <Blank9> The dodge is more like a bayo dodge
[1:49:25] <SaltyAzteca> @Scevda Just you wait for the obligatory power of friendship
[1:49:25] <%RetroCop87> It's been a while since I played a Tales, but I believe attacking from the back does more damage
[1:49:25] <%AncelDeLambert> is this combat meant to be spectacle fighter?
[1:49:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Diamonds are Arte Charges
[1:49:29] <%athuramn> (y)
[1:49:30] <jtsoppy137> you can make it even easier
[1:49:32] <jorniev> love that guitar
[1:49:32] <%deviljhojho_> "we"
[1:49:34] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz it seems like the combat is dragging on a bit
[1:49:36] <kinkade_77> swallow blade already, isnt that usually a late game art
[1:49:40] <%pcn24454> @AncelDeLambert To a degree
[1:49:45] <%Scevda> @SaltyAzteca ITS here
[1:49:46] <%DevinMayCry> @AncelDeLambert Boss fights have absurd spectable to it
[1:49:47] <KaironFortressKnight> Also, bit of advice, the game targets in the direction of your stick. Go neutral for it to aim to your lockon
[1:49:49] <@goose_attack_almanac> FUCK

[1:51:17] <+ghostfaceninja_> isn't racism central to the plot in most tales games?
[1:51:19] <%KineticZen> Happy feet
[1:51:19] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @ChungusQuest thats just quebeckois behavior
[1:51:23] <+TheBitingIrish> This combat looks worlds better than Berseria
[1:51:29] <+MelancholicMasochist> same with rebirth
[1:51:30] <%blastyoboots> oh it's animated!?
[1:51:30] <@QueequegTheater> Why do they bounce like that in the air
[1:51:30] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Skit mode i love this
[1:51:32] <+ALazo> new skit style
[1:51:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> my nazi waifu can't possibly be this cute
[1:51:35] <jorniev> THIS IS HOW THEY DO SKITS NOW
[1:51:37] <haitakaa> Woolie would have a blast with this
[1:51:42] <%lucky_icarus> Scarlet Nexus
[1:51:42] <%TheGreatSkenardo> He was a Dan, She was a Ran, could it be any more obvious
[1:51:42] <Zombrocom> Oh it's the scarlet nexus thing
[1:51:42] <jbrachob> but you are smoking hot...
[1:51:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Chat, who's your favorite Tales character to play
[1:51:44] <%Raikouija> Racism and subverting expectations is the Bread and Butter of the Tales series
[1:51:44] <%polothegreatest> KISS
[1:51:44] <%blue8moon> is the sword covered in blood or rust?
[1:51:46] <%stantheman_97> the money saving dimension
[1:51:46] <%Scevda> for some reason this game has like 5 different presentation styles I don't get why games have more of this these days.
[1:51:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> lady
[1:51:47] <gildor0> she has to learn to not be racist throught the power of friendship
[1:51:48] <%deviljhojho_> she is a racist and loves guns so you might be right
[1:51:49] <%Sunriser41> god they are laying the racism thick
[1:51:50] <@Spydurman> how are you not a filthy lowly slave?
[1:51:51] <+Xenoska> brother/sister?!
[1:51:52] <Madinki> WIFE
[1:51:54] <+matf8> oh no the racism
[1:51:55] <%jackythefrost> @QueequegTheater Tales games are all about air combos thats why
[1:51:56] <notsoy> woolie would definitely enjoy the racism
[1:51:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> kinda like yakuza
[1:51:58] <@goose_attack_almanac> his hair is the same colour
[1:51:59] <+UKOrigin> she's kind of an asshole huh 🤣
[1:51:59] <jtsoppy137> no face
[1:52:01] <blackjack8182> I miss the anime cutouts
[1:52:02] <Treasure_Vault> It's fine when Yakuza does it.
[1:52:04] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> "yeah i would never be friends with a YourRace"
[1:52:05] <HaroldDonchee> its animated at least
[1:52:05] <@QueequegTheater> @jackythefrost But it looks so bad
[1:52:05] <WTFOliver> you wanna pump the artes as much as you just can each fight bc they grow stronger every 100 -> 500 and idk how far it goes
[1:52:06] <jorniev> THINK ABOUT WIFE
[1:52:06] <%Starotter70> I miss the old skits
[1:52:08] <@Ranryu692> are these the new skits?
[1:52:10] <%BubbaRands> Hmmmmmmm
[1:52:10] <%RayReborne> it's Decent, it before it was well portrayed Anime body portaits
[1:52:11] <+InuOblivion> What a toxic Waifu
[1:52:13] <%YakumoYomi> They still have more animation/movement than Scarlet Nexus
[1:52:13] <SaltyAzteca> YOU HAVE A MEDIEVAL RUINER MASK
[1:52:15] <RyuuAoi> The manga
[1:52:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> But they're still 3d animated models
[1:52:16] <@Spydurman> Yakuza budget dimension
[1:52:17] <kinkade_77> its way better than the portraits
[1:52:18] <%DevinMayCry> @Ranryu692 yES
[1:52:19] <%Mattais88> "who could forget these abs"
[1:52:20] <%athuramn> you'll soon have an option to choose manual or stay on semi. I would just take a minute to see which feels more suited to yourself
[1:52:21] <%Meekest> Shes like THAT SO HOT
[1:52:22] <%Scevda> So you can touch my weiner if you want
[1:52:23] <Madinki> THINK ABOUT WIFE ABNIESIA MAN
[1:52:25] <stevenlambchops> "I can't be racist, I'm friends with a Dahnan"
[1:52:25] <%marusux> I love you Ray Chase.
[1:52:27] <ToneBacas> so you only feel good?
[1:52:28] <%toastybites> THE PHANTOM PAIN

[1:52:33] <%KineticZen> No pain, no face, no memories, all edge
[1:52:40] <+pyrojack6> Hey Pat, just checkin' in to say after 10 hours playing the PS4 Version, the load times are no longer than like 3 seconds and it's very smooth. no texture pop in, just an overall good experience so far
[1:52:41] <@goose_attack_almanac> how... do you see
[1:52:41] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SLAVE
[1:52:42] <AoiRob> eh i prefer when these are done with 2d portraits like TWEWY
[1:52:43] <%Deft_Thought> "Then you can gimmie that hard peen!" -Gun girl, probably
[1:52:44] <+LowHighKang> Racist wiafus is the new trend
[1:52:45] <+MelancholicMasochist> more distracting than the portraits
[1:52:46] <Gorshum> A pose!
[1:52:49] <SaltyAzteca> OH SHIT ITS LEONARDO DiCAPRIO
[1:52:49] <%baronouroboros> He only knows one thing: he needs to kill Chaos
[1:52:50] <%AncelDeLambert> that is a STUPID reason to call him that!
[1:52:50] <Hoaxfish> "no face" - if only I could just take my helmet off
[1:52:51] <HaroldDonchee> we call him.. tall guy blue shirt..
[1:52:53] <%tank7013> Wait so they're just pals now?

[1:52:55] <ChungusQuest> was she A-posing?
[1:52:55] <%Scevda> @nabs96 "i can work with this!"
[1:52:55] <%king_wragles> I'm back, did I miss the trex?
[1:52:57] <%blue8moon> if he doesn't know who he is, why would he know his real name?
[1:53:05] <%greencapps> She hears no pain and immediately is into him
[1:53:07] <@QueequegTheater> That was a very sassy pose
[1:53:09] <%alphonseisbest> @pyrojack6 NICE
[1:53:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> of course idiot
[1:53:12] <@Ranryu692> she just playfully called you silly. she 180d as soon as she heard you couldn't feel pain
[1:53:12] <AthenaAegis> Iron Mask been using too much Guardian Forces
[1:53:15] <RyuuAoi> @king_wragles It's comin!
[1:53:16] <blackjack8182> Was she a posing?
[1:53:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> what does it look like from the inside
[1:53:20] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:53:21] <+pectusumbra> So are we gonna end up with a D/S relationship like a Disgaea game or something?
[1:53:22] <%Mattais88> OH My God, last Tales was King Arthur, is this man in the Iron Mask?
[1:53:27] <+LowHighKang> Yeah on hard you get more post battle bonus

[1:53:33] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT'S ALL YOU GET
[1:53:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> hard to eat
[1:53:34] <scrumbotime> oh god he has to mash food up through the little angle near his chin
[1:53:34] <%sonofthedeepsouth> CONVENIANT
[1:53:35] <mismagilou> idk if I like these visuals
[1:53:35] <Alzero83> His face must be Dirty and Stank
[1:53:36] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[1:53:38] <%RayReborne> @pyrojack6 i played for five seconds on my ps5 with the ps4 version and saw the NPCs textures pop in. so idk how you did that lol
[1:53:39] <%blue8moon> nose itches, how scratch?
[1:53:40] <%RigmaroleHM> Just mash it into the mask
[1:53:41] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HOW DO U EAT
[1:53:42] <Goldenwolf98> shoves it under the mask
[1:53:42] <%blastyoboots> I think a straw fits through to the mouth
[1:53:43] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HOW
[1:53:44] <%furiousfurioso> just gotta push it up through the bottom
[1:53:45] <%Scevda> slides the spoon up into the mouth area
[1:53:45] <HaroldDonchee> just pour the slop into the holes
[1:53:45] <Phob05> Just the nasties scalp ever
[1:53:45] <%Qsmash_> its hard but he does eat
[1:53:46] <%DevinMayCry> They probably only eat gruel anyway
[1:53:47] <%RigmaroleHM> Eat by osmosis
[1:53:47] <jorniev> @Deft_Thought VERY CAREFULLY
[1:53:48] <%Paperware> @blackjack8182 No, the default poses just look kinda weird
[1:53:49] <+matf8> how does he eat though?
[1:53:49] <%Ynkubus_> They feed him through his butt
[1:53:49] <+TheBitingIrish> Maybe he just eats gruel through a straw?
[1:53:49] <SaltyAzteca> Kakashi mask syndrome
[1:53:51] <+Vigonept> straws
[1:53:51] <KaironFortressKnight> Nah he hot
[1:53:53] <@QueequegTheater> Okay but HOW THO
[1:53:53] <@Spydurman> HOW
[1:53:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Just mashes it all up
[1:53:54] <@goose_attack_almanac> HIS FACE IS SO PASTY
[1:53:55] <Blank9> cram it past his chin
[1:53:56] <%chiazam> HOW
[1:53:57] <Madinki> HOW DOES HE EAT OR SEE?!
[1:53:58] <%dirtyjames04> can only eat smoothies
[1:53:58] <%JoshManVGH> Imagine how dirty his hair is
[1:53:59] <haitakaa> imagine never washing your face
[1:53:59] <%toastybites> acne
[1:54:00] <%Mattais88> pour soup down the eye holes
[1:54:01] <%Qsmash_> its just REALLY difficult
[1:54:01] <%Mr_Pylon> Ants probably crawl into the mask at night to feast
[1:54:02] <Alzero83> Sweaty and Unable to clean his face or hair....
[1:54:03] <@Ranryu692> he's gonna take it off and have a perfect complexion
[1:54:04] <%tank7013> @blue8moon Apparently no scratch, only suffer
[1:54:05] <stevenlambchops> Imagine the hell he'd be in if he ever threw up
[1:54:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> @blue8moon piece of velcro on the inside like the astronauts
[1:54:06] <@Spydurman> I dare this game to show him eating a meal
[1:54:07] <+JustToWatch> his breath must be horrible
[1:54:08] <%JoshManVGH> Just greased up in there
[1:54:08] <%YakumoYomi> Maybe he mashes his food into paste and slurps it through a straw he shoves under the mask?
[1:54:08] <+matf8> under the mask must be real gross
[1:54:09] <+TheBitingIrish> Mask tan doodSick
[1:54:09] <robosqueeb> you know how your leg gets all wilted after wearing a cast? thats just his entire face
[1:54:09] <MyNameIsRasus> NEVER BRUSHED TEETH
[1:54:10] <@QueequegTheater> NO, EXPLAIN HOW YOU EAT
[1:54:11] <%DevinMayCry> The slits he can see through obviously
[1:54:14] <%DevinMayCry> But eating is less clear
[1:54:16] <%GuilKato> his skin would be fused into the inner lining of the mask by now - and his hair would be disgusting
[1:54:18] <scrumbotime> Yeah, they need Souls.
[1:54:21] <RyuuAoi> Damn. It's torture. Total damnation. Slavery.
[1:54:22] <%athuramn> it jutts out at by the chin, he eats under it
[1:54:23] <%LouieRouie> he must shove food under the bottom
[1:54:24] <%DevinMayCry> Are we sure he does eat?
[1:54:27] <Madinki> SHOW ME HOW HE EATS GAME
[1:54:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> I saw the advertisements so I know, but what if he was just super disgusting under there
[1:54:29] <%dirtyjames04> oh GOD NO TEETH BRUSH
[1:54:29] <%sonofthedeepsouth> UNDERSTANDABLE
[1:54:29] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> So he has a Melee players face then?
[1:54:30] <+pyrojack6> @QueequegTheater he wedges it up the mask
[1:54:31] <%Ynkubus_> He clearly buutchugs
[1:54:31] <bigboy3d> you know he'll just be a pretty boy
[1:54:32] <Goldenwolf98> @QueequegTheater with a straw Kappa
[1:54:33] <Samaugsch2> @queequegtheater Very carefully
[1:54:34] <%DevinMayCry> There was no bathrooms guys
[1:54:38] <MyNameIsRasus> There's an opening between the chin and the mask
[1:54:39] <Alzero83> His face would be Sweaty and Gooey
[1:54:43] <%jackythefrost> @PatStaresAt These cutscenes are the replacement for the skits from the previous tales games
[1:54:44] <jorniev> WHAT IF THE MASK IS LIKE SCI FI
[1:54:46] <%GuilKato> "Renan Rule" ,,,,, you mean enslavement?
[1:54:46] <haitakaa> oh man what if he got a cavity
[1:54:47] <%Scevda> lazy nazis
[1:54:47] <@Ranryu692> yeah
[1:54:47] <%sonofthedeepsouth> 300 centuries of peace
[1:54:49] <@QueequegTheater> Those are all bad explanations
[1:54:50] <%deviljhojho_> Fair enough!
[1:54:50] <%RayReborne> GUYS YOU CAN SEE HIS CHIN, HE JUST GOES UNDER THE MASK
[1:54:53] <scrumbotime> The soldiers don't have to actually be good if they're scary and the slaves are weak
[1:54:53] <TheHeroAppears> elite jobbers
[1:54:57] <%tank7013> They literally haven't had to fight in centuries
[1:54:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> his mouth is on the bottom of his chin
[1:55:01] <%Monkeyweed21> 300 years of no challenge
[1:55:03] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Centuries of peace is good
[1:55:06] <+pectusumbra> @jorniev it's a tales game, that's a safe bet
[1:55:07] <%deviljhojho_> they have golden parachutes
[1:55:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> food go up into head
[1:55:09] <%AllenDeadman> I mean yeah
[1:55:10] <@SpaceCapnCrone> It is not just like the simulations
[1:55:11] <jtsoppy137> Mirage in air
[1:55:13] <%Scevda> yet
[1:55:16] <%baronouroboros> they're basically the Bri'ish Empire
[1:55:16] <ChungusQuest> that's like 15 generations of career soldiers
[1:55:16] <%twistedj3ster> swallow my blade gottem
[1:55:17] <%AllenDeadman> 300 years with no fight will do that
[1:55:18] <+pyrojack6> THIS GAME HAS COMBOS FOR DAYS
[1:55:18] <@QueequegTheater> Centuries of peace makes you a fucking pussy
[1:55:19] <%MonsterEnvy> You can look at her arts in the art sceen
[1:55:26] <%MonsterEnvy> Mirage is an air art
[1:55:29] <%JoshManVGH> BTW, Astral Arts are what Danah can't use, those are basically spells, Artes with cast time
[1:55:32] <ChungusQuest> they're lucky their helmets are facing the right way
[1:55:32] <jorniev> @pectusumbra i honestly love the magic technology stuff

[2:08:02] <ShinBojangles> @alphonseisbest hmmm if you say so jaboodyHmm
[2:08:02] <%MonsterEnvy> I prefer semi art a bit
[2:08:02] <Blank9> yeah you want manual
[2:08:03] <%RayReborne> now you have to aim lol
[2:08:07] <+Xenoska> ff12 battle like system, nice
[2:08:08] <%RealThiele> Bladewolf got bought out by Zoogle
[2:08:09] <%hamborgini> 'member when manual control was an accessory you had to find and equip?
[2:08:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> I wish I'd known this with the demo
[2:08:11] <Profmcstevie> Manual is free aim
[2:08:14] <+trackles_64> so weak
[2:08:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow its just an action game
[2:08:19] <%AgniBrandt> You can miss, but importantly you can make sure that wide-range attacks hit more enemies
[2:08:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> i didn't like running towards the target
[2:08:24] <jtsoppy137> Wifu is made of glass
[2:08:26] <%Starotter70> Manual is a bit looser but with more control

[2:08:42] <+Delenay> you probably get more art gems as you go
[2:08:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> When the Hitstop is more of a Hit slowdown
[2:08:43] <Blank9> manual lets you aim and time way better
[2:08:46] <%RealThiele> YOUR CP
[2:08:48] <%MonsterEnvy> First aid costs 12 cp
[2:08:48] <+TheBitingIrish> Are cure points per-battle? Are there restoration items for them?
[2:08:49] <KaironFortressKnight> When playing manual, go neutral with the stick so that your character aims at the opponent. Otherwise your character swings in the left stick direction
[2:08:51] <haitakaa> it refills automatically
[2:08:51] <BinaryShuffle> FIGHT
[2:08:53] <%furiousfurioso> nah fight it
[2:08:55] <MyNameIsRasus> that dude is not that bad

[2:09:46] <MyNameIsRasus> you'll know when the real bad one shows up
[2:09:48] <+Delenay> in old games
[2:09:49] <+TheBitingIrish> Wtf, she said 'Resuscitation', not 'Resurrection'
[2:09:50] <KaironFortressKnight> very important to dodge
[2:09:53] <%RealThiele> strange core
[2:09:56] <charrchord> I'm surprised he even got a hit on you
[2:09:58] <+TheBitingIrish> GG, localization
[2:09:58] <%AgniBrandt> That might happen later in the game
[2:10:01] <+kewlmyc> Not in this game. People giving you tips based on previous games
[2:10:02] <%RayReborne> no armor = take big damage, those guys won't be as bad in a bit
[2:10:02] <jtsoppy137> oops
[2:10:03] <%Paperware> You also lose score by playing bad too
[2:10:04] <%AgniBrandt> The shortcuts, I mean
[2:10:04] <Archmortal> not yet
[2:10:06] <%athuramn> he's not that bad because you have an ai partner. the next time you're advised on difficult enemies, I would take the caution seriously @patstaresat
[2:10:07] <%Starotter70> This game is quite different to past ones
[2:10:09] <butthurtdave> Take a rest
[2:10:13] <+Delenay> probably when zeph fully joins
[2:10:18] <MyNameIsRasus> you can also just heal from the main menu screen, press triangle methinks
[2:10:21] <%Scevda> climbing that ledge like its 1999
[2:10:25] <%Raikouija> @kewlmyc seriously they took that out?!?!
[2:10:26] <BinaryShuffle> Antidote... rock?
[2:10:28] <butthurtdave> CHAOS
[2:10:34] <+LowHighKang> During battle, hold L1 plus dpad to switch characters.
[2:10:39] <@Ranryu692> do they heal poisoning by beating people with rocks?
[2:10:40] <%MonsterEnvy> Life Bottles are you Phoenix downs
[2:10:44] <Phob05> Hey she cant get her if she gets hit in the core so that means that cleavage armor makes sense LUL
[2:10:53] <butthurtdave> nah he wears it for the whole game
[2:10:53] <%Raikouija> bonfire!
[2:10:54] <+TheBitingIrish> It feels like it's one step foward, two steps back with every new Tales game
[2:10:56] <%alphonseisbest> nah
[2:10:59] <Ids560> It seems like either that or the end of the game
[2:11:01] <%Bailey__gaming> life bottle aka vodka
[2:11:03] <%Varlinator> Yeah, that's totally Riz's VO
[2:11:04] <+kewlmyc> @Raikouija The directional buttons do assist attacks now.
[2:11:04] <ntwinz> Hold L1 in combat to switch characters
[2:11:08] <reasonance> I just noticed she's in heels lol
[2:11:09] <+Delenay> i hope she isnt going to wear the dress the entire time
[2:11:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> @thebitingirish honestly seems like a good idea since it circumvents the why dont you just revive characters during the story kinda
[2:11:12] <haitakaa> I've come up with a new recipe
[2:11:15] <MyNameIsRasus> @TheBitingIrish how does this feel like two steps back?
[2:11:18] <%Scevda> forced synergy meetings
[2:11:18] <%alphonseisbest> @TheBitingIrish how so??
[2:11:21] <%ape_hawk> wheres the big anime tiddies?
[2:11:22] <%Weeabooninja> Hello, is game good?

[2:11:27] <RyuuAoi> I bet that mask stays on.
[2:11:29] <arcadianskypirate> anyone bring marshmallows?
[2:11:37] <%Starotter70> LUL
[2:11:38] <Treyu000> BUY STUFF
[2:11:38] <Explodincatz> bondfire
[2:11:40] <+trackles_64> DLC
[2:11:40] <%BoxNavy> dlc :)
[2:11:42] <%Scevda> yep
[2:11:44] <scrumbotime> "WANNA BUY A DLC" every time you rest
[2:11:44] <@Ranryu692> it's pretty grimy
[2:11:45] <jtsoppy137> about the option?
[2:11:45] <%RayReborne> Wait what option?
[2:11:51] <BinaryShuffle> CONSOOM PAT
[2:11:51] <HaroldDonchee> that is pretty horrible
[2:11:51] <%alphonseisbest> GOOD
[2:11:54] <KaironFortressKnight> It's not that big of a deal honestly. Its like DMC5
[2:11:54] <%Scevda> NEWS: BUY OUR SHIT
[2:11:55] <%SveriSageAdvice> man thats an egregiously annoying spot to put it
[2:11:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> what option?
[2:12:00] <Blank9> they're in pause screens already, eh
[2:12:00] <OkoPoko> The mask stays on during
[2:12:01] <AoiRob> yea that's kinda too much
[2:12:01] <+NobuuNobuu> It is kinda out of place
[2:12:02] <@ssjklyco> Seems dumb since you can just not touch the button
[2:12:02] <Coystick> what option?
[2:12:02] <+SoriduSnaku> but I mean it's optional who cares
[2:12:03] <+balouie> have they never played a tales game they are chock full of dlc
[2:12:04] <%Raikouija> dlc?
[2:12:05] <panic_rabbit> this feels like the better bits of ffxv
[2:12:06] <MyNameIsRasus> that is pretty bad but eh
[2:12:08] <%RetroCop87> Tales games have always been shoving DLC down the player throat, not sure why they're furious now
[2:12:08] <jtsoppy137> dont call me son DAD
[2:12:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> better or worse than the DLC dwarf npc in Dragon Age Origins?
[2:12:10] <charrchord> "There's a secret way to gain SP" ;)
[2:12:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Remember when there was a DLC merchant at your camp in Dragon Age Origins
[2:12:13] <Phob05> Buy our 800 bikini costumes
[2:12:13] <draca23> Yeah, and they took WAYYYYY too many points off their scores as a result
[2:12:14] <Profmcstevie> Tales DLC is always gross, mountains of costumes and resources on day 1
[2:12:15] <RyuuAoi> Do the DLC
[2:12:15] <+pectusumbra> It's not awful but it is tasteless
[2:12:17] <%GuilKato> Zephyr wants to bang Iron Mask
[2:12:18] <RyuuAoi> Let's see
[2:12:26] <+cvp5127> xion
[2:12:27] <%cothrin> there was a skit at the campsite
[2:12:29] <ShinBojangles> Whats the DLC? Do you get a 2B outfit for your MC?
[2:12:32] <%SaiyanShoto> It's not that big of deal, DLC exists. plus you can just ignore it
[2:12:34] <%RayReborne> tbh if they kept the dlc in the main menu only, like previous games, no one would bitch
[2:12:37] <+trackles_64> Kill them all
[2:12:37] <%Scevda> one more R-word
[2:12:39] <HaroldDonchee> having dlc in a menu I have to use frequently is the same level as mobile games
[2:12:40] <jorniev> i like how he points out the obvious
[2:12:41] <%NopeBadguy> kill them all, peter
[2:12:41] <RyuuAoi> @guilkato Prob
[2:12:42] <%toastybites> "You're not a racist?"
[2:12:42] <%RealThiele> *WINK*
[2:12:46] <+Joysta> well that's dumb gonna watch smth else
[2:12:48] <haitakaa> well only eye lit up when he used the sword so maybe he's a halfbreed
[2:12:57] <topiodonk> its a bonus!
[2:12:58] <@Ranryu692> I'm impressed that they addressed the possibility that he might be a Renan. Says to me that he's definitely a half-breed
[2:12:59] <BinaryShuffle> You don't want to commit genocide?
[2:13:00] <+InEzrealwetrust> yeah ok endevor
[2:13:00] <haitakaa> one eye*
[2:13:01] <Phob05> I think it IS too much but I think people are just used to it
[2:13:02] <%alphonseisbest> @HaroldDonchee u sound like a child
[2:13:07] <+trackles_64> well dedend ourselves with genocide
[2:13:07] <%RealThiele> centrists
[2:13:08] <Treasure_Vault> We hope we don't have to kill all of them, because that would take a while
[2:13:08] <+InEzrealwetrust> endeavor*
[2:13:14] <%AncelDeLambert> is he TRYING to sound like Kronk?
[2:13:14] <+ArCielArDor> genocide is optional, as a treat.
[2:13:15] <topiodonk> like a treat
[2:13:16] <Explodincatz> u will never be free from gravity
[2:13:20] <ChungusQuest> "Yeah, I'm gonna kill them all, and I'll probably be laughing the whole time, but that doesn't mean I *enjoy* it"
[2:13:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Like Berseria had the attack-limiting attack diamonds and enemies shrugged off every attack that wasn't a direct weakness, and this game gives you access to fewer abilities at one time and limits healing
[2:13:23] <%MonsterEnvy> No
[2:13:23] <+kewlmyc> NO PAT
[2:13:24] <dmtjinni> yes

[2:14:29] <ChungusQuest> so resources, then
[2:14:29] <%ape_hawk> ASS ENERGY
[2:14:30] <%Scevda> its ass energy

[2:15:21] <@TheYellowcouch> Fake slavery to get the real slavery juice
[2:15:22] <Treasure_Vault> Whoever gets the most slave karma is king

[2:19:31] <reasonance> "when I look up at the anime space moon, I see a perfect society"
[2:19:41] <butthurtdave> Is he wearing the mask or is it stuck on his head
[2:19:41] <ammobasket> U look like my girlfrend tho ;D
[2:19:41] <Jaysky> Under da sea
[2:19:42] <AzureGale> This is the worst PvP mode ever
[2:19:51] <jorniev> EPIC WON THE LAWSUIT?
[2:19:55] <%Scevda> CHEKOV's memory
[2:19:55] <tentavision> time travel?
[2:19:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they were roommates
[2:20:00] <%RayReborne> so Rule for 3 years, then start next contest and go for 7 years. goddamn
[2:20:00] <%Piemono> Hot
[2:20:00] <+trackles_64> twin cest is bestest
[2:20:03] <%RonaldMcDownload> wow she really is Elly van Houten
[2:20:04] <ChungusQuest> fuck I thought that was a crystal lizard for a second
[2:20:05] <%Meekest> Apple won 9/10
[2:20:05] <Bustahhwulf> could he be the rightful ruler
[2:20:06] <Treasure_Vault> I hope they kiss before they find out they're siblings. AND AFTER
[2:20:08] <Jaysky> Btw I hate these comic book panels in games. Is it a new trend?
[2:20:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> they both Lost
[2:20:09] <@Ranryu692> Apple won, not Epic
[2:20:09] <scrumbotime> He's absolutely a spaceman who forgot
[2:20:09] <%BestTeaMaker> this isn't 12 minutes :V
[2:20:09] <+trizetacannon44> That's why he is wearing the mask
[2:20:10] <OkoPoko> Or married?
[2:20:11] <@goose_attack_almanac> apple you mean
[2:20:12] <AzureGale> This isn't Fire Emblem, Pat, this is probably not incest
[2:20:12] <+cvp5127> they both losed
[2:20:13] <Profmcstevie> They both lost
[2:20:14] <jtsoppy137> it was a draw
[2:20:14] <%Divryne> They both lost.
[2:20:14] <ammobasket> She pushed him
[2:20:18] <+AnthonyJMax> the indies won
[2:20:19] <+cermo55> the people more or less won
[2:20:20] <+Vigonept> lost you mean
[2:20:23] <leinadtonu> so it's one of THOSE stories...
[2:20:23] <%Divryne> Judge was smart.
[2:20:25] <%Kyma1020> I thought 1/10?
[2:20:26] <+cvp5127> thats great
[2:20:26] <+pectusumbra> They did both lose yeah.
[2:20:27] <@ssjklyco> Epic still has to pay apple I think
[2:20:27] <ChungusQuest> The rest of the marketplace won
[2:20:29] <%BestTeaMaker> it's also not over, this was just an injunction
[2:20:29] <+twohitgood> epic won the one that counts as far as why they even started all that mess.
[2:20:29] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> epic has to pay apple a shitload of money and apple has to buckle on a bunch of conditions
[2:20:30] <%TheGreatSkenardo> The return of the reminisce button
[2:20:32] <%Scevda> because hes dope as fuck
[2:20:33] <%RealThiele> if they both lost we won
[2:20:33] <tattleworm> epic lost a couple of million, apple are gonna lose billions. epic won.
[2:20:34] <%ape_hawk> this is a dumb way to do cutscenes
[2:20:35] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> anyone who hates corporations won big
[2:20:37] <RyuuAoi> Fake news
[2:20:38] <+cermo55> good judge
[2:20:39] <%Kyma1020> Judge was smart and they both got fucked
[2:20:40] <+cvp5127> so the bet outcome
[2:20:40] <%BoxNavy> its true they are
[2:20:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> good judge
[2:20:43] <%RayReborne> THATS THE BEST RESULT
[2:20:46] <@Ranryu692> @tattleworm epic is still banned from the app store
[2:20:49] <%Sunriser41> and thats the best result for everyone
[2:20:49] <%Scevda> doc knows more than he lets on
[2:20:51] <%Agami23> the people won the lawsuit
[2:20:52] <%tank7013> Ok how many times are they gonna reiterate this
[2:20:52] <+trackles_64> Iam your brother
[2:20:53] <%Aeoneth> Epic got what they wanted kinda, but it cost them money and dignity
[2:20:53] <jorniev> THEY BOTH LOST, AWESOME!
[2:20:56] <blackjack8182> Apple deserved to lose
[2:20:59] <%saadi90> Good end
[2:21:00] <%AncelDeLambert> why would the mask mean he remember something?
[2:21:00] <%Divryne> Tim was being super salty on Twitter today from the result.
[2:21:01] <+pectusumbra> Epic has to pay, but Apple has to allow other forms of payment on their app shit
[2:21:03] <tentavision> "the crimson crows tour off their spirit cores" HURRAY FOR ANIME BULLSHIT!!!
[2:21:03] <%Scevda> he can't see his balls
[2:21:05] <%hoodedlefty> Did he really
[2:21:09] <ShinBojangles> Apps are allowed to link to outside stores so Apple lost this
[2:21:11] <HaroldDonchee> his balls also have an iron mask
[2:21:15] <Phob05> "My balls have a mask too!"
[2:21:15] <%GuilKato> Zephyr will help with that Pat
[2:21:16] <butthurtdave> anime girl noises
[2:21:16] <+king_of_beggars> 9 out of 10? Who presided over that trial? Gamespot?
[2:21:16] <RyuuAoi> They are both stupid. Third world problems.
[2:21:17] <topiodonk> dip it in the river like a teabag
[2:21:18] <%peyodogo> patrick
[2:21:21] <%RayReborne> @divryne GOOD, DRINK THE MAN CHILDS TEARS
[2:21:22] <+TheBitingIrish> @tattleworm I saw that Apple isn't obligated to let Fortnite back on the app store, so Epic lost that too
[2:21:23] <%Scevda> Why can
[2:21:24] <tentavision> is that Erica Lindbeck?
[2:21:25] <@ssjklyco> Use code Castle for 10% off manscape, Iron Mask
[2:21:26] <+trackles_64> He is a ranan lord all along
[2:21:30] <butthurtdave> what are the odds that zephyr is gonna die at the end of this chapter
[2:21:33] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Finger taps
[2:21:33] <%Bailey__gaming> this guy the same voice as monster hunter world general man?
[2:21:34] <panic_rabbit> sounds like a job for dannanscaped
[2:21:35] <%SaiyanShoto> Austin Powers?
[2:21:36] <+Shadic790> Apple still has the right to remove the app off the store though
[2:21:36] <%Scevda> Why can't we just play as Zephyr.
[2:21:38] <%BestTeaMaker> zephyr is best dad
[2:21:40] <%RayReborne> yes @tentavision
[2:21:42] <scrumbotime> i know its not, but that scar on the big guys head looks like he's been burned down to the skullbones
[2:21:46] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[2:21:48] <ShinBojangles> They both suck but Apple sucks more
[2:21:50] <deity_majora> Epic lost badly. The only thing they won was the right to offer in app purchases. Outside of that they are still banned and Apple still gets a cut of those in app purchases that doesn't use apple pay
[2:21:50] <+twohitgood> @tattleworm and they're appealing that. given that the one win was about the core matter of in-app purchases, they could wind up winning the appeal, too.
[2:21:51] <%BoxNavy> jrpg moment
[2:21:52] <jtsoppy137> lady yes its real
[2:21:52] <%ape_hawk> FOR REAL?!?
[2:21:52] <doggieo> I like this new skit style.
[2:21:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> they already went over it
[2:21:53] <%TheGreatSkenardo> she does the edge worth arm grasp
[2:21:55] <+king_of_beggars> YOU SAW THE BURNS
[2:21:59] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt so is this the first tales game you think you'd get into
[2:21:59] <RyuuAoi> Dig in his business
[2:21:59] <+Delenay> he was probably what drove her to fight. what she lost was him
[2:22:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> he burned his arms and was fine
[2:22:02] <AzureGale> veiLUL
[2:22:03] <%Agami23> oh god
[2:22:07] <%KaiserMario> She's not Paige, Pat!
[2:22:08] <OneThousandTomatoes> NotLikeThis
[2:22:13] <draca23> Better than Zestiria's skits, that's for damn sure.
[2:22:14] <%Scevda> hes got cancer
[2:22:17] <%hairtoday> literally a leper
[2:22:23] <SaltyAzteca> Teetering on the brink
[2:22:24] <@Ranryu692> it would be interesting if they turned this into a mechanic by hiding his health bar
[2:22:28] <%BestTeaMaker> Zestiria is a fucking trashfire in every sense of the word
[2:22:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> i can tell I'm going to get very frustrated with these characters
[2:22:30] <+trackles_64> START THE UPRISING
[2:22:34] <%Mattais88> Prince Louis's twin brother
[2:22:35] <%BestTeaMaker> I played it for a few days for Arise's release
[2:22:40] <%BestTeaMaker> we are now free of hideo baba's shadow
[2:22:40] <%dirtyjames04> chewin gum
[2:22:44] <%Dakuu75> just like Paige's V-tuber
[2:22:45] <HaroldDonchee> this whole planet seems like fucking ditches
[2:22:45] <Profmcstevie> Chewing air
[2:22:45] <%TheGreatSkenardo> did someone say race war
[2:22:46] <arcadianskypirate> @Ranryu692 That would be cool and terrifying LUL
[2:22:47] <Madinki> "Really?" SPLOOSHHH
[2:22:48] <+trackles_64> sleep together?
[2:22:51] <ShinBojangles> So what are the best DLC costumes in this game?
[2:22:51] <ChungusQuest> loves that gum
[2:22:52] <Shardlab> Your teeth must be rotten in that mask
[2:22:53] <Phob05> Buy the DLC to hear what shes saying
[2:22:55] <notsoy> that is totally at odds with the fucking space bitcoin mine planet
[2:22:57] <+king_of_beggars> Ditches get a bad rap. They need some marketing voodoo to glam up that street appeal.
[2:23:00] <Saltmeisterr> BOPBOPBOPSCICLE
[2:23:04] <@Ranryu692> @arcadianskypirate seriously LUL maybe only for the highest difficulty
[2:23:05] <%Scevda> @Madinki "I can work with this!"
[2:23:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> If Iron Mask had an invisible healthbar because he doesn't notice how injured he is, that'd be narratively awesome but mechanically terrible.
[2:23:19] <brachydios777> So apprantly China banned new video games from being released there
[2:23:19] <Shardlab> Good thing you can't feel what must be a monster multiple toothache
[2:23:23] <YamadaZero> This UI reminds me of Code Vein.
[2:23:23] <RyuuAoi> Is Iron Mask big spoon or little?
[2:23:25] <Madinki> @Scevda "LET'S SEE WHERE IT GOES!"
[2:23:29] <+trackles_64> trying to be anime
[2:23:31] <+Wildpandaman> The anime is affecting to you

[2:23:32] <ShinBojangles> Pat is turning into an anime character
[2:23:34] <%RealThiele> ditches get a bad rap because of the smell, like a sewer

[2:38:38] <%KineticZen> Not a death flag at all

[2:38:40] <GilliamYaeger> He's totally going to die
[2:38:42] <%BoxNavy> nice
[2:38:42] <Tennochief> Most likely the temporary Party member
[2:38:45] <Blank9> zephyr is a big strong man
[2:38:45] <%Mattais88> means hes either gonna die or betray you
[2:38:48] <%RealThiele> yeah parent in an anime i smell death flag
[2:38:50] <%AllenDeadman> I mean you have a shitty rusted sword
[2:38:51] <+Delenay> and youll get the angry number 2

[2:38:55] <%deviljhojho_> intimidation purposes
[2:38:56] <SaltyAzteca> Convenience
[2:39:00] <%deviljhojho_> nah man he is old and cool, he is fucking dead
[2:39:00] <%cooldude69xx> or evil
[2:39:02] <%RonaldMcDownload> map trail is so you don't get turned around
[2:39:02] <%Meekest> Pat it's a JRPG
[2:39:04] <doggieo> BEING dead
[2:39:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> So people like Paige can know where they're going
[2:39:06] <%Scevda> One of their things, And its Bandai Namco. its alphabetical
[2:39:07] <+Vigonept> so you dont get turned around or like youve got the thing there
[2:39:08] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh, he's TOTALLY gonna die
[2:39:10] <tentavision> maybe he's just horribly injured
[2:39:11] <%tank7013> Yea, he's busy being a corpse
[2:39:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat he's so going to die
[2:39:12] <%deviljhojho_> the best JRPG protagonists are terrorists
[2:39:13] <@Ranryu692> I need to go hang out with Major Kira
[2:39:13] <%Monkeyweed21> busy being dead
[2:39:13] <%TheHateFish> It's a JRPG
[2:39:15] <%OctaivianRex> "I need to go do someting."
[2:39:16] <AzureGale> What if he turns out to be ebil
[2:39:18] <%baka_sugoi> Don't mind me imma do a TERROR
[2:39:19] <%MisterRockett> It's kinda useful.
[2:39:19] <+transporterthesequel> He went to Terrorist heaven
[2:39:22] <%RayReborne> Cheer500 So funny enough, the Tales game with probably the worst Story, Graces F, was my first Tales game. it's characters and character dynamic with the party, with the gameplay, kept me engaged, despite the God awful story. and yes, I kept playing these games. Idk man, anime game can be pretty good still despite stupid bullshit
[2:39:22] <HaroldDonchee> I won't forgive you wild animals
[2:39:22] <%AllenDeadman> or horribly incapacitated
[2:39:23] <%OctaivianRex> "What?" "Be dead."
[2:39:24] <studleydoorite> I won't forgive these armadillos!
[2:39:27] <+megaman_sentinel> come on man old guy mentor he's dead for sure
[2:39:36] <%Cerabret100> So i'm farther but not far enought to know, but he gives total Gonna Die energy
[2:39:37] <%GuilKato> seduce him into the party
[2:39:41] <%Scevda> @studleydoorite for living!
[2:39:41] <%athuramn> <:
[2:39:42] <%RayReborne> It's very good
[2:39:44] <%twistedj3ster> I still can't get over that owl, it's my favorite thing so far
[2:39:50] <%TheHateFish> I've never even played a Tales game, and I could tell you he's either probably gonna die or he's gonna drop in effectiveness once he's a full character.
[2:39:52] <AzureGale> berseria SLAM
[2:39:54] <artoflec> you dont swing a sword in Berseria :)
[2:39:58] <%Mattais88> I loved the gameplay fo Berseria
[2:39:59] <%deviljhojho_> isnt the worst tale the one with the furry main character
[2:40:03] <%baronouroboros> Iron Mask's a tank, that guy's a dps, and the second protag's a healer
[2:40:04] <%Cerabret100> Berseria gets real fun when you get the soul token generation consistance

[2:47:15] <mismagilou> @Basker17 not a sequel
[2:47:17] <%Paperware> Costumes comes with skills, which is kinda p2w
[2:47:17] <%Scevda> @Basker17 same serial naming as FF, tales of XXXX
[2:47:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> they're going to get people the hornies though
[2:47:27] <%Agami23> i think the worst game thing i saw for spoiling cast members is that the special edition box for persona 5 showed the entire cast including crow
[2:47:32] <%RealThiele> so the chinese new game "ban" is just the CCP not giving new game licenses out as quickly since its run by their propaganda arm now for screening
[2:47:37] <@Ranryu692> old men tend to be haters by default
[2:47:39] <+Vigonept> old people usually are
[2:47:42] <HaroldDonchee> bright eyes is a really weird name to call your slave lord masters
[2:47:50] <mismagilou> get off his dirt

[3:07:02] <Lynxystem> thanks VitoXXI retroKANPAI
[3:07:02] <+jofrankii> it gets easier with more unlocked mechsnics
[3:07:06] <%RealThiele> tales are tough in the beginning
[3:07:06] <Blank9> you can change it to normal in menu if you want
[3:07:07] <HaroldDonchee> you have a pocket healer. you'll be fine
[3:07:08] <Reanimator83> how is this hard LUL
[3:07:09] <%JoshManVGH> Normal has felt fine so far
[3:07:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> Remember this man beat DMC5
[3:07:11] <+TrevSmith222> I kept getting one shot and went back to normal.
[3:07:11] <%AgniBrandt> Moderate might be a bit much for someone who hasn't played a Tales game in forever?
[3:07:14] <%Pookiedaexzile> Don't let him fool you
[3:07:17] <%athuramn> why are you playing this on hard @patstaresat
[3:07:19] <%hamborgini> yeah, this wasn't too different from my experience on normal
[3:07:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah they are pretty damage sponge-y for early enemies
[3:07:21] <%polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[3:07:22] <%AgniBrandt> I'm doing fine on it but I've played a lot of Tales
[3:07:22] <Profmcstevie> You're playing a Tales game with a small party, it's gonna be like that
[3:07:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> mostly just time consuming it seems
[3:07:30] <doggieo> MODERATE
[3:07:30] <%Monkeyweed21> its not hard @athuramn
[3:07:31] <AngriestVincent> this isnt a spoiler,but i cant wait until you reach a certain enemy called Berserker
[3:07:31] <%Cerabret100> I mean they hit hard on normal as well
[3:07:32] <%Scevda> but not hard moderate
[3:07:35] <%JoshManVGH> Time for normal!
[3:07:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> He beat DMC 5
[3:07:37] <%MonsterEnvy> These guys still hit like trucks even on normal
[3:07:37] <+kewlmyc> THE BACKDOWN
[3:07:38] <%Scevda> normal is the new normal
[3:07:38] <%rekinom> Don't be mean to Pat, chat bullied him into hard mode
[3:07:40] <@TheYellowcouch> If everyone told you to jump off a cliff would you??
[3:07:41] <%RealThiele> true action economy is fucking you atm
[3:07:41] <PanicSwytch> Don't listen to chat
[3:07:43] <%AllenDeadman> this is moderate
[3:07:43] <+jofrankii> LUL
[3:07:44] <%Caped_Eggy> But why did you listen?
[3:07:45] <%AllenDeadman> not hard
[3:07:49] <Gorgs7> They keep saying shit about the Renans wanting to wipe them out, but that's specifically not what they want. They need you all alive to harvest the spirit juice
[3:07:49] <%Taisuru> Normal is the new normal
[3:07:50] <%RayReborne> normal the fights aren't ungodly long
[3:07:52] <%ape_hawk> its a tales game, pat, not dark souls
[3:07:52] <quietshun> It's moderate mode tho
[3:07:54] <animecupz> how far in is this
[3:07:55] <studleydoorite> jermaOneGuy jump off that cliff!
[3:07:58] <%VitoXXI> moderate is hard?
[3:07:58] <AngriestVincent> Moderate is just baby hardmode
[3:08:01] <RyuuAoi> He listened. Chat lied.
[3:08:01] <%Mattais88> Has Mass Effect taught you nothing?
[3:08:04] <%Scevda> hes saying you are not OP enough
[3:08:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> just ness with it and find what youre comfortable with
[3:08:16] <AngriestVincent> @VitoXXI technically,yeah.
[3:08:17] <Profmcstevie> He's saying your stocks suck Kappa
[3:08:21] <zerointelligence000> just got here but is this game worth it on pc? I know pat had some trouble running it last time
[3:08:23] <%Scevda> @Mattais88 he learned?
[3:08:27] <s1rcuit> @rbakervv from what I've seen so far the slaves have access and knowledge of metalworking and pottery, it'd be impossible to stop them from making cookwear
[3:08:28] <AngriestVincent> if you go by difficulty order
[3:08:32] <doggieo> Seems about the same from Moderate
[3:08:32] <%RealThiele> it means your 2 characters only do 2 actions per ATB, a full party gets 4 actions per ATB
[3:08:41] <Treasure_Vault> I just found out there are seven magic the gathering cards banned in every format for being culturally insensitive.
[3:08:46] <+Stormzcales_Lair> might be these enemies
[3:08:49] <%Taisuru> Did it save?
[3:08:50] <set29> I've been playing on moderate its really not bad
[3:08:50] <+kewlmyc> They're beefy and your equipment sucks. It's supposed to be hard right now
[3:08:51] <%Scevda> @RealThiele tru
[3:08:53] <%Mattais88> @Scevda He learned to ignore chats talking about difficulty
[3:08:56] <%RayReborne> hard mode early on just beefs hp to stupid levels
[3:08:59] <%Raikouija> the NOT BACKDOWN
[3:09:12] <%AllenDeadman> nah your weapon is just shitty LUL
[3:09:16] <%Taisuru> The unbackdown
[3:09:17] <AoiRob> THE UNBACKDOWING
[3:09:18] <rasamune> @Treasure_Vault Weren't some of them drawn by an actual klansman or something
[3:09:30] <%Monkeyweed21> the anti backdown, Pat did a front up
[3:09:37] <%Scevda> hmmmmmmmmm
[3:09:38] <%ape_hawk> daddy died for a pot
[3:09:41] <Treasure_Vault> @Treasure_Vault I didn't know that!
[3:09:44] <%cvp5127> dad got owned
[3:09:46] <%athuramn> I think it's viable to go up in difficulty once you have your party full. combos with members make the game a much smoother experience
[3:09:48] <%Taisuru> @Treasure_Vault I never heard that, it's mostly just the card names or art
[3:09:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> Daddy Died so you can eat
[3:09:54] <%AllenDeadman> damn
[3:09:55] <RyuuAoi> Never Backdown 6 Unbackening
[3:09:55] <%rekinom> fcuking bnuny
[3:09:55] <tubit> we saved the cooking pot tho
[3:09:57] <%AgniBrandt> It may be worth your time to set the AI to avoid enemies at 50% HP or below. It's set to 25% by default, and early on a lot of stuff can chunk you for over 25%
[3:09:58] <%Mattais88> Oh god I hope the berseria leveling weapon system isn'there. that was terrible
[3:09:58] <%Meekest> Child traumatized, quest complete
[3:10:03] <%RealThiele> racist waifu unmoved
[3:10:04] <%Agami23> spheregrid time!
[3:10:05] <@Ranryu692> sphere grid?
[3:10:07] <%AllenDeadman> anyways
[3:10:07] <%Scevda> @Mattais88 he also never learned to play :>)
[3:10:08] <mattymcfilth> QUEST COMPLETE
[3:10:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> What a Shame
[3:10:14] <%cvp5127> now you can parry
[3:10:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Just got power back, second week in a row we lose power from 7:30 pm to 9:30~10pm on the south shore
[3:10:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> congrats on making the kid cry here's a buff
[3:10:18] <+jofrankii> It deepens
[3:10:18] <%polothegreatest> countaa OhMyDog OhMyDog
[3:10:19] <%Cozy90> gib the child money
[3:10:19] <%hamborgini> have a skill... tree?... materia grid?
[3:10:19] <AoiRob> sphere time
[3:10:22] <%cooldude69xx> @Treasure_Vault Not by a klansman, but the card LOOKS like one
[3:10:26] <%tank7013> Gald sounds like a shitpost
[3:10:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> on friday both days
[3:10:30] <%RealThiele> it is time
[3:10:33] <%VitoXXI> this plays like graces f?
[3:10:34] <%Afterman_> shionne has a good skill, its called KO protection, get it asap
[3:10:38] <%Kyma1020> He look a sphere grid!
[3:10:38] <Profmcstevie> Time to spec into some bullshit
[3:10:39] <%einterblathnir> einterblathnir subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:10:40] <%RayReborne> @mattais88 it was a lot but got better when you got used to it, especially when you max upgrade stuff
[3:10:40] <Blank9> cash4gald
[3:10:42] <%Scevda> @OneThousandTomatoes childrens tears make me yoke as hell
[3:10:43] <zerointelligence000> this looks like ff7:r progression kinda
[3:10:51] <%furiousfurioso> you only have the top ones
[3:10:55] <rasamune> @Treasure_Vault I thought the guy who drew that card turned out to be like super racist for real
[3:11:00] <Blank9> nah don't have all of them
[3:11:02] <%Afterman_> get the ko protection asap, it'll legit be a life saver
[3:11:07] <+sonuke_draws> sonic thrust
[3:11:14] <%RealThiele> air dash sounds hot
[3:11:15] <%Taisuru> Barrage of Thrusts Kreygasm
[3:11:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt sonic thrust is good
[3:11:16] <%Afterman_> AG not agility
[3:11:20] <%AllenDeadman> yo air dash?
[3:11:22] <%cooldude69xx> @Treasure_Vault The name of the card was rough to look at too, but I forget it ATM
[3:11:22] <%MonsterEnvy> Not agility Arte uses
[3:11:22] <+Rofiarf> AG is not agility
[3:11:22] <%Afterman_> it gives you another action point
[3:11:23] <%RayReborne> no that's max Arte points Pat
[3:11:24] <%AgniBrandt> AG is your blue diamonds that tell you how many artes you can use
[3:11:25] <%Garthunox> yeah get sonic thrust
[3:11:26] <+ahdurian> its not agility, its you special stuff
[3:11:29] <+Rofiarf> AG is your arte points
[3:11:30] <+kewlmyc> AG is how many times you can attack. Those diamond things
[3:11:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> For the reason of "it looks like FF7 Remake" This looks meh
[3:11:36] <%Mattais88> @RayReborne It was just so tedious melting down a hundred of a weapon, to basically just clear space
[3:11:37] <AngriestVincent> air dash must be nasty utility
[3:11:38] <Treasure_Vault> Did he draw all seven of the cards? That'd be wild.
[3:11:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> there's an air dash?
[3:11:43] <Profmcstevie> Arte Gauge I guess
[3:11:47] <%RealThiele> Action gauge?
[3:11:50] <%Afterman_> ko protection asap
[3:11:52] <%MonsterEnvy> Also the titles  have complition bonuses
[3:11:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> i was missing that in the demo to
[3:11:54] <%Scevda> @ChrisPlaysThing its not as polished as that
[3:11:57] <%AllenDeadman> nice
[3:11:59] <%RayReborne> METEOR TIMES 3
[3:12:03] <Th3rd3> Gun Bang Bang
[3:12:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Attorney General
[3:12:07] <AngriestVincent> we unlocked Stinger!
[3:12:07] <+NobuuNobuu> save for ko
[3:12:14] <%Afterman_> save for ko
[3:12:14] <%Scevda> ko prevention helps
[3:12:19] <%VitoXXI> arte gauge is usually TP no AP
[3:12:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Scevda That's even worse T_T
[3:12:23] <%VitoXXI> not*
[3:12:27] <+kewlmyc> KO prevention REALLY helps with Shionne
[3:12:28] <HaroldDonchee> thanks for the xp tears child
[3:12:34] <%Cerabret100> Yes
[3:12:34] <%Afterman_> yes
[3:12:38] <Sol_Install> yes
[3:12:40] <Profmcstevie> The more elements we get the better, we can start playing to weaknesses
[3:12:41] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes each time you earn a title
[3:12:41] <+jofrankii> alot more
[3:12:41] <+Rofiarf> as you earn titles
[3:12:41] <+NobuuNobuu> lots of them
[3:12:42] <%furiousfurioso> titles are what unlocks them
[3:12:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Can we go back to the era go good jrpg's?
[3:12:44] <%Nekros4442> yep
[3:12:44] <%RayReborne> yeah way more titles, scroll right
[3:12:44] <+Vanslainstreams> yeah you unlock a bunch of them
[3:12:46] <%Cerabret100> Some auto unlock, some unlock when you do cerrtain things enough times
[3:12:46] <%JoshManVGH> Looks like there are a tobln
[3:12:53] <%AllenDeadman> as you get more titles yes
[3:12:53] <%alphonseisbest> YES LOTS
[3:12:56] <%AllenDeadman> I assume
[3:12:57] <%Scevda> @ChrisPlaysThing it is what it is
[3:13:02] <+kewlmyc> That's what he said?
[3:13:02] <tubit> sonic boom!
[3:13:08] <%jackythefrost> SKILL TREE GETS HUGE
[3:13:11] <+mainthehor2> is the theme of this game stormbloody?
[3:13:12] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> the he'll is wrong with chat "it looks like ff7" the hells wrong with your eyes
[3:13:12] <%furiousfurioso> she's ai so she can do whatever
[3:13:13] <%preeeow> Does PS5 contoller work for pc version? i was told controllers were busted on pc atm
[3:13:14] <+kewlmyc> Because you're not controlling her.
[3:13:15] <%Mattais88> soinc Thrust, Sonic thrust, Soinic Thrust
[3:13:17] <%alphonseisbest> @ChrisPlaysThing bitch pls
[3:13:18] <Blank9> npc get to use all of them
[3:13:21] <Blank9> until you contorl them
[3:13:23] <+Rofiarf> yes
[3:13:27] <+Caidezes> NPCs can.
[3:13:28] <%hamborgini> the AI can use anything, you can only use what you set here
[3:13:28] <+Rofiarf> you can edit it during battle
[3:13:28] <+ArticPath> AI can use them all
[3:13:30] <%cvp5127> yes from the menu
[3:13:33] <%JoshManVGH> You can change them mid fight
[3:13:34] <+ALazo> yeah, but you have to go into the meny
[3:13:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[3:13:37] <+ALazo> menu*
[3:13:38] <+ArticPath> you can also change them in battle
[3:13:38] <%AgniBrandt> NPCs get the full suite or artes. You only get what's bound
[3:13:40] <+kewlmyc> If you're not controlling them, the party members can use all of their attacks
[3:13:42] <%alphonseisbest> AI CAN
[3:13:42] <%Monkeyweed21> you can pull up a menu
[3:13:44] <AngriestVincent> NPCs can use all of them,active characters can use only 3.
[3:13:44] <%JoshManVGH> NPCs can just be told to use them
[3:13:46] <%AllenDeadman> you got o the menu
[3:13:46] <%RayReborne> yes but need to go in the menu, AI have all artes that are on can use all of them
[3:13:47] <%Nekros4442> AI will use them all but you can edit your selection during combat stilll
[3:13:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> cmon pls
[3:13:47] <+jofrankii> you can change them by pausing in battle
[3:13:48] <Profmcstevie> AI has full access, you have a quickselect
[3:13:48] <%Scevda> @preeeow apparently he got a work around
[3:13:52] <AngriestVincent> AI*
[3:13:52] <doggieo> You can change artes mid battle right?
[3:13:54] <%Cerabret100> that mapping only matters if you're controlling her directly i believe
[3:13:55] <%AllenDeadman> NPCs just do it
[3:13:56] <Sol_Install> people calling arise ff7r must be on that good shit
[3:13:56] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Also you should mark the next skill you want so you are infromed when you have a enough sp to buy them.
[3:13:56] <%JoshManVGH> Hit L1
[3:13:59] <HaroldDonchee> thats weird but cool kinda. how do you know your npcs won't use shit ones?
[3:14:01] <%AllenDeadman> AI*
[3:14:18] <%Cerabret100> @HaroldDonchee you can disable them for the AI to not use
[3:14:19] <Blank9> @HaroldDonchee you can disable any artes you want for npc's
[3:14:20] <%Scevda> ALL the Acronyms!
[3:14:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Guys, if i get bezos bucks rich i'm going to push/produce a bunch of classic type rpgs
[3:14:26] <+MelancholicMasochist> you can turn off the ones you dont want them to use
[3:14:30] <%Nekros4442> @HaroldDonchee you can disable certain ones if you want
[3:14:30] <+pectusumbra> @HaroldDonchee usually you can disable ones you don't want them to use
[3:14:33] <%Afterman_> skill points
[3:14:35] <%Afterman_> i think
[3:14:37] <%JoshManVGH> It looks like each character can get up to 15 titles @patstaresat
[3:14:37] <AngriestVincent> yeah man check out some CP
[3:14:38] <ammobasket> I think you can change mid-fight?
[3:14:43] <HaroldDonchee> ahh ok. that's sick
[3:14:43] <AngriestVincent> just click L2 LUL
[3:14:45] <+kewlmyc> CP is cure points. There are no combat points. You're thinking Skill Points
[3:14:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I don't even care if they make money, i just want games i enjoy to be made
[3:14:48] <fatcrab_kurl> is there anything in the stat menu or equipment menu
[3:14:49] <%Monkeyweed21> combat points is for later
[3:14:54] <+megaman_sentinel> skill?
[3:14:55] <%alphonseisbest> There is
[3:14:57] <%zarkazeon> if it's like other tales Gamez it won't be for until u beat the game
[3:15:07] <%Afterman_> skill point is combat point i think
[3:15:10] <%furiousfurioso> if it's like previous tales games, combat points get added up at the end of the game and you can spend them on new game plus things
[3:15:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> seems like it
[3:15:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> So basically NOT, a Tales game Kappa
[3:15:28] <%rekinom> is this a one off stream?
[3:15:28] <%JoshManVGH> So far this seems wildly different in some regards
[3:15:28] <%alphonseisbest> yea
[3:15:29] <%furiousfurioso> MAYBE idk if its true for this one
[3:15:31] <%alphonseisbest> usually
[3:15:36] <%Taisuru> Yes, I believe that's hwo it is in most tales games
[3:15:38] <RyuuAoi> Naw game should be inviting
[3:15:38] <%Mattais88> I thought that was Grade?
[3:15:39] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you get higher score from higher difficulties, then spend score on NG+ bonuses in Tales games
[3:15:42] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Also all the titles have completion bonuses so if you get all five skills you get a bonus
[3:15:44] <Profmcstevie> If Combat Points are like Grade from previous games, they are a NG+ currency
[3:15:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Like some game are Not, a Suikoden
[3:15:46] <%RayReborne> idk what Combat points do yet either, MAYBE new game +
[3:15:48] <@QueequegTheater> You must defeat the game to access this CP
[3:15:50] <+kewlmyc> STOP CALLING THEM COMBAT POINTS. It's confusing. Chat is thinking "grade".
[3:15:56] <%alphonseisbest> its not, its fun to grab BUSTED shit for mg+
[3:16:01] <%cooldude69xx> Pat Would Rather Not Stare at CP
[3:16:09] <%RayReborne> @kewlmyc the game calls them that dude
[3:16:16] <%rbakervv> @kewlmyc the game called them combat points
[3:16:21] <+Dragon4234> Wrong lol
[3:16:23] <%alphonseisbest> @kewlmyc they changed the naming in this
[3:16:26] <%JoshManVGH> OH IT'S THE GRADE SYSTEM!
[3:16:26] <%AllenDeadman> he's not referring to Cure Points chat
[3:16:28] <%Afterman_> combat points are skill points
[3:16:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Don't Tax my CP!" Patrick Boivin 2021
[3:16:35] <%Afterman_> i think its named wrong in that article
[3:16:41] <%JoshManVGH> You get a combat point rating at the end of fights
[3:16:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt higher difficulty gives a bonus to skill points and xp gained
[3:16:56] <%RayReborne> Oh yeah, ok
[3:16:56] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Kappa
[3:17:04] <+kewlmyc> So there's combat points and cure points? They should have gone with something else.
[3:17:05] <%JoshManVGH> And it looks like those turn into Skill Points?
[3:17:16] <Mushinronja> Combat Points are what used to be Grade, which is NG+ modifier things. Cure Points is also a thing, which means there are 2 CPs, which is dumb.
[3:17:16] <%alphonseisbest> @Monkeyweed21 thats really cool tbh
[3:17:19] <%Scevda> Bad design to introduce an element not even used until much later.
[3:17:25] <mismagilou> girl you never seen me play rpg
[3:17:26] <%furiousfurioso> the new game plus thing was called "Grade" in the old games and appeared to be similarly formatted, which is why we weren't sure
[3:17:31] <%alphonseisbest> @kewlmyc yes, yes they should've
[3:17:32] <%Monkeyweed21> missed a quest
[3:17:41] <%Scevda> Especially in bunny ears
[3:17:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat will have all the Cheese Pizza he can eat Kappa
[3:17:47] <+nivlac_555> wow
[3:17:50] <%RonaldMcDownload> gone forever
[3:17:50] <%furiousfurioso> you can just grab it, you didnt "miss" it
[3:17:53] <%AgniBrandt> I don't think they're actually missable though, are they?
[3:17:59] <%Monkeyweed21> you can still pick it up
[3:18:00] <@QueequegTheater> Gone forever
[3:18:03] <+Rofiarf> you can do quests later if you miss them
[3:18:03] <+kewlmyc> You can still get it, just get it after this cutscene. Some lady with a envelope over her head
[3:18:05] <%RayReborne> quets don't disappear, plus that one is to fight that uber monster from earlier
[3:18:06] <+ahdurian> the blacksmith quest? its not missed
[3:18:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> she looks like a gacha character with those ears
[3:18:10] <@Spydurman> you'll never get it back
[3:18:24] <%BinaryFireball> damn you connor oberst!
[3:18:27] <%kknutson4> Why is the main character in a Zero mask from Code Geass?
[3:18:28] <+Caidezes> Quests show up on the map. So just check the map.
[3:18:28] <%AgniBrandt> Look for NPCs or Map Icons that are envelopes

[3:21:58] <@Spydurman> "Why aren't you as racist as me??"
[3:21:58] <%cooldude69xx> This game really likes talking about its own tropes. It's more interesting dialogue than I was expecting
[3:22:00] <%RayReborne> time for big summon moves
[3:22:04] <%hamborgini> zeugals here, zeugals there, zeugals in my underwear
[3:22:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "the reward is genocide"
[3:22:19] <HaroldDonchee> yo that looks cool
[3:22:24] <%Cyn1cal_ttv> Remember AAZ (always assume zeugaks)
[3:22:25] <%Nekros4442> Boost Attacks are big important
[3:22:27] <%Taisuru> LUL
[3:22:28] <%Afterman_> its d-pad ultimates
[3:22:29] <%AgniBrandt> Counter edge is your perfect dodge attack
[3:22:31] <+jofrankii> perfect counter attack
[3:22:34] <%Taisuru> M E C H A N I C S
[3:22:35] <%alphonseisbest> dodge the hit
[3:22:37] <+trackles_64> tutorial
[3:22:37] <@Ranryu692> wasn't counter edge the skill you were on when you first saw the sphere grid?
[3:22:39] <%Afterman_> push up or left on dpad
[3:22:42] <%AllenDeadman> perfect counter
[3:22:49] <%Nekros4442> d-pad Pat
[3:22:54] <tubit> are we even hurting these doggos?
[3:22:54] <%cooldude69xx> Its the wolf from Rivals of Aether!
[3:22:54] <%Mattais88> EX?
[3:22:55] <%KineticZen> I can't stop pronouncing them "ar-tehs"
[3:23:06] <%Nekros4442> yep
[3:23:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> biggus combo
[3:23:11] <%baka_sugoi> G U N
[3:23:11] <%Nekros4442> Chain the combo
[3:23:12] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> Cheer500 Pat, if I were to play just one “Tales of” game, which would you recommend?
[3:23:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> neat
[3:23:17] <%Taisuru> It's good on aerial enemies it said
[3:23:21] <HaroldDonchee> buster beam time
[3:23:22] <@goose_attack_almanac> I have no idea what button it wants
[3:23:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Pew pew attack V1"
[3:23:24] <Brostress> blast the gat shinji
[3:23:26] <%AllenDeadman> combo combo combo
[3:23:34] <Blank9> his is a hard knockdown it looks like, so you can't do more juggles
[3:23:38] <AngriestVincent> G U N
[3:23:40] <%alphonseisbest> SHE SON'T MISS
[3:23:40] <%baka_sugoi> AND SHE GOT TAIL TOO sbfpOmg
[3:23:54] <Profmcstevie> She's a marvel assist
[3:23:56] <+ApollyonAOD> HYPER VIPER BEAM
[3:23:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm so lost with this i already don't care
[3:23:58] <%tank7013> @goose_attack_almanac Seems to be the corresponding d-pad button at the bottom left
[3:23:58] <AzureGale> TARGET ACQUIRED! PROTON CANNON!
[3:24:00] <%hamborgini> the boost attack interrupts her casting animations
[3:24:08] <%baka_sugoi> SHE'S CABLE
[3:24:15] <@goose_attack_almanac> ahh
[3:24:18] <studleydoorite> I don't know how she could miss with that attack
[3:24:22] <%Afterman_> unfortunately the bars dont fill this fast in REAL fights
[3:24:23] <%VitoXXI> where the demon fang tho
[3:24:27] <%baka_sugoi> woolieGASM woolieGIRLS
[3:24:37] <+Danny2Tons> hi pat
[3:24:42] <jorniev> OH MAN THE EAR
[3:24:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "I never miss" What? the broad side of a barn?
[3:24:46] <jorniev> the ears
[3:24:46] <%TheHateFish> Is Sonic Thrust just a Stinger?
[3:24:58] <AngriestVincent> yup.
[3:25:00] <Profmcstevie> Tutorial recharge rate?! Man I hate that, a taste of godly power
[3:25:00] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt You get more with more party members though eventually
[3:25:00] <jorniev> @TheHateFish yes
[3:25:00] <+trackles_64> Gotta make them dopamines go high
[3:25:01] <+jojo_abob> @VitoXXI what bout the double demon fang?
[3:25:02] <Blank9> it does fill faster if you do perfect dodge attacks and big combos
[3:25:04] <%dantejoestar21> sorta
[3:25:04] <%bevyrage> sonic thrust is in fact the 'Tales of' stinger
[3:25:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> A peach on a string?
[3:25:10] <studleydoorite> no Sonic Thrust is my Sonic fanfic
[3:25:17] <%KineticZen> Those dogs have mohawks, clearly they're antisocial punks
[3:25:18] <clintlickr> does she ever miss?
[3:25:25] <fatcrab_kurl> this looks pretty sick
[3:25:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> cool
[3:25:27] <%dantejoestar21> @jojo_abob  or Fierce Demon Fang?
[3:25:27] <gunstars20> COMBOS
[3:25:30] <%bevyrage> if you can get a team attack with two people running sonic thrust it's a cross-slash
[3:25:35] <Blank9> oh man you can do it midair
[3:25:37] <AngriestVincent> DAMN YOU DUNKED IT
[3:25:40] <UnsteadyFunk> NOW it's a video game
[3:25:42] <%hamborgini> she does, in face, sometimes miss
[3:25:44] <%baka_sugoi> How do combos feel?
[3:25:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this looks like it feels good to play
[3:25:50] <clintlickr> ayo is this the new DMC?
[3:25:59] <jorniev> @TheHateFish ithere was an unision attack in symphonia called cross thrust it was the coolest
[3:26:10] <+ahdurian> agreed
[3:26:10] <%Afterman_> yes
[3:26:11] <%Taisuru> Bersaria had no weight
[3:26:16] <%Afterman_> as someone who like berseria
[3:26:17] <+megaman_sentinel> yes it does
[3:26:17] <+Vanslainstreams> Berseria was fine compared to zestiria, berseria really isn't that great
[3:26:17] <+jofrankii> yeah fard agree
[3:26:18] <zerointelligence000> I kinda wish ff7r's combat was like this
[3:26:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I haven't even caught up to Tales of Berzeria
[3:26:19] <%MisterRockett> They are indeed insane.
[3:26:19] <%Afterman_> yues
[3:26:21] <%tank7013> I don't know what it was but something you did caused a chuck of his bar to go up
[3:26:22] <%AllenDeadman> mhm
[3:26:23] <%AgniBrandt> Combat wise, this is bar none the best 3D one
[3:26:26] <+ALazo> the people saying that berseria was fine came from zestiria, which was even WORSE
[3:26:27] <quietshun> It is, but Berseria was fun too
[3:26:28] <jorniev> berseria was good compared to zesteria
[3:26:28] <%Monkeyweed21> Berseria is pretty lightweight and is pretty hit or miss yea
[3:26:32] <%AgniBrandt> Xillia's the best 2D for my money
[3:26:32] <xbb1024> hello
[3:26:32] <@QueequegTheater> Berseria fans malding
[3:26:34] <%colezone_> I actually don't know what you mean
[3:26:34] <puse9> yup attacks have weight
[3:26:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I still have to complete Destiny 1 and 2 and zestiria
[3:26:38] <%RayReborne> I understand your Thoughts Pat, I'm just ok with Berserias combat. I like it
[3:26:39] <%Bluwizard21> @jorniev All the unison attacks and the beta skillset moves were amazing
[3:26:41] <@goose_attack_almanac> I think Xillia has the better combat compared to Berseria
[3:26:42] <tubit> gaaald
[3:26:44] <%athuramn> this is way better

[3:30:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> You don't know who's in chat
[3:30:54] <%Monkeyweed21> Ray Chase taught Ichiban how to use a phone
[3:30:56] <%Mr_Pylon> Yo Nick Ogata, sick
[3:30:59] <%JoshManVGH> I think the entire cast plays the Hootle
[3:31:01] <%raychasetwitch> no I played king hootle
[3:31:02] <mrshazboto> Man Iron Mask is the best. I got a theory that he's actually Alphen but there's no way to really tell
[3:31:02] <RyuuAoi> I could go for feet

[3:31:50] <AzureGale> That is true
[3:31:50] <GilliamYaeger> COMBO
[3:31:56] <%Monkeyweed21> and second half Nier in the remake
[3:31:58] <brachydios777> Ray is also older brother Nier
[3:31:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's how it is
[3:32:01] <+Doctor_Stew> That seems like a real sweet comment until you remember he has no memory
[3:32:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> lol
[3:32:02] <%baka_sugoi> YALL WANNA LEARN AN INFINITE
[3:32:06] <@goose_attack_almanac> Yo he was also Cinder in KI. That's a good asshole voice. Nice job.
[3:32:06] <SaltyAzteca> The next JYB or Steve Blum, basically
[3:32:08] <%SovPho> I think a better handling of grouped up ingredients like that is a "hold to collect all" thing
[3:32:13] <PanicSwytch> He did the master of mastersnin KH
[3:32:16] <RyuuAoi> Ray is also Mario
[3:32:17] <%Taisuru> That's why there's the concept of getting a "big break"
[3:32:17] <+Doctor_Stew> He likely remembers no other marksmen
[3:32:19] <%raychasetwitch> Nah you still have to audition like 8 times a day. Lots of failures

[3:37:20] <+curse85> symphonia and vesperia were great
[3:37:35] <+ScrapKingKeita> Tales is basically just a Character Action game, but JRPG

[3:38:03] <%Nekros4442> @goose_attack_almanac To be fair...every Tales story is basically the same
[3:38:05] <@goose_attack_almanac> Also having your MC be a Fist man instead of a Sword guy was cool
[3:38:05] <%doublebagpilot> Abyss was underrated
[3:38:10] <%Mattais88> Loud Noises!
[3:38:11] <%TheGreatSkenardo> You should have a dog heart rate monitor

[3:38:32] <%VitoXXI> yeaaaa demon fang
[3:38:34] <%Bluwizard21> oh shit
[3:38:36] <Blank9> @supersonic21 Good game, but man that is wild to jump into. Good concept spending the entire game in medical debt though.
[3:38:36] <fatcrab_kurl> eat dirt
[3:38:38] <%Starotter70> DEMON FANG
[3:38:38] <%Bluwizard21> he's learning lloyd moves
[3:38:41] <%templar010> Vesperia!
[3:38:41] <+jojo_abob> what about double demon fand??

[3:38:47] <gunstars20> Time to spam that shit LUL
[3:38:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Sonic Demon Fang
[3:38:50] <ErikFeral> "Eat Dirt" he says to the rock golem
[3:38:53] <A_Cat_Herder> Chat I fucked off for a while to eat dinner, is the game good?
[3:38:57] <%baka_sugoi> kill steal
[3:38:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Tiger Fang
[3:39:01] <%Bluwizard21> Raging Tiger Beast is like the best move
[3:39:01] <jorniev> ha im a genoius double demon fang
[3:39:09] <mrshazboto> @A_Cat_Herder game is VERY good
[3:39:11] <Blank9> sword rain is best move
[3:39:13] <brachydios777> Game good
[3:39:14] <%TheGreatSkenardo> seems ok, writing outside of reminisciences seems bad
[3:39:17] <+bluedude153> is it possible to make the racist lady look even worse
[3:39:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> specs
[3:39:25] <A_Cat_Herder> @mrshazboto thanks dude
[3:39:25] <RyuuAoi> Your dicks got bigger
[3:39:27] <%Bluwizard21> shit i might get this game
[3:39:29] <%hamborgini> my pc is just slightly better than a base ps4 and this game runs fine
[3:39:40] <%dantejoestar21> @blank9  Sword Rain Alpha*
[3:39:44] <%Agami23> that first area looked pretty intensive.
[3:39:44] <+supersonic21> I’ve been playing on series x, it’s been playing very well in the graphical mode
[3:39:48] <@goose_attack_almanac> @bluedude153 You can add accessories and put them in costumes.
[3:39:52] <%Monkeyweed21> @bluedude153 oh dude this is nothing, just wait until you get the endgame mascot suits for the whole party
[3:39:54] <%GuilKato> but if you're a pc gamer your video card (and cpu) will always be more powerful than console hardware
[3:39:56] <%Paperware> demon fang is basically a repuken
[3:40:01] <+bluedude153> oh no
[3:40:07] <+bluedude153> im asking PAT to make her look worse
[3:40:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt arte proficiency
[3:40:29] <brachydios777> Wish there's a search bar for these
[3:40:31] <+tr1ps_ax1om> zeugle...
[3:40:35] <%Monkeyweed21> use artes to learn artes
[3:40:37] <%furiousfurioso> basically the more you use a skill the stronger it gets, and it lets you unlock more skills
[3:40:40] <%Mattais88> Use magic to get stronger magic
[3:40:50] <%Nekros4442> Use Artes lets you learn more artes
[3:40:51] <Blank9> it has a count there
[3:40:55] <+ScrapKingKeita> specific, I think?
[3:40:55] <%baka_sugoi> SWRD N GUUN
[3:40:55] <Profmcstevie> Do good learn more good of the same type
[3:40:56] <+Rofiarf> press l1
[3:40:59] <BinaryShuffle> Use arte you are good at, learn new arte
[3:41:05] <%Nekros4442> Shionne is Gun, Fire and Heal I think?
[3:41:14] <%AgniBrandt> Alphen has ground, aerial, and something else I don't have yet. Shionne has Astral artes, gun artes, and a third you'll get later
[3:41:15] <gunstars20> use arte arte good
[3:41:18] <%arcadianskypirate> @raychasetwitch Sorry I noticed this late, but thank you for the sub!
[3:41:30] <+Rofiarf> press l1 in the menu to see the arte category
[3:41:33] <mrshazboto> Go to stats to look at "proficiencies"
[3:41:43] <%Deft_Thought> Man, seeing all the art of this dude with the half-mask is such a bummer. He looks so much cooler with the iron helm sitting on his head
[3:41:44] <mrshazboto> Your proficiency count goes up as you use skills
[3:41:46] <+mikejz88> do the thing
[3:41:50] <mrshazboto> And that teaches you more skills
[3:41:50] <%raychasetwitch> of course arcadianskypirate
[3:41:51] <+Rofiarf> in the main menu
[3:42:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> So is it actually night-time or is Paige just around and you can't look up? Kappa
[3:42:08] <%AgniBrandt> Sword and aerial--important distinction for this system
[3:42:09] <%Deft_Thought> Yeah, you wanna have a protagonist with a face but...
[3:42:16] <+supersonic21> I don’t think I’ve learned the proper efficient way to use arts myself
[3:42:17] <%KineticZen> Reppuken
[3:42:27] <+ALazo> reppuken
[3:42:28] <+sonuke_draws> double demon fang
[3:42:34] <AngriestVincent> Drive
[3:42:37] <%MisterRockett> Demon Fang is another legacy move pretty much all sword users in Tales games gets it.
[3:42:42] <Blank9> good for range or filler even point blank
[3:42:44] <mrshazboto> I'm really excited to meet this Alphen guy you all talk about. He sounds cool.
[3:42:48] <+tr1ps_ax1om> man they talk alot
[3:42:49] <%Monkeyweed21> Demon Fang and Sonic thrust are the Tales staples for sword dudes
[3:42:53] <%raychasetwitch> I have pc, should I get a controller for it or just do mouse and keys
[3:42:54] <%baka_sugoi> can you combo after the drop?
[3:43:04] <%Nekros4442> Do you only have Mirage as your aerial art?
[3:43:08] <tubit> big ol' enemy rock
[3:43:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> sorry Pat
[3:43:10] <AzureGale> Oh my god, a giant rock
[3:43:15] <%Nekros4442> @baka_sugoi yes, you can cancel the recovery after the drop with a break attack
[3:43:16] <%raychasetwitch> sweet thanks
[3:43:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I have like 6 controllers, grab a controller tbh
[3:43:22] <+Vigonept> get yours hammer man
[3:43:23] <%SovPho> @raychasetwitch how does one get started in VA
[3:43:26] <dantea1994> mouse and keyboard actually isnt too bad
[3:43:27] <AzureGale> Yeah this is a controller-ass game
[3:43:29] <rasamune> Do you have the HM yet
[3:43:32] <%athuramn> controller, good sir
[3:43:38] <%baka_sugoi> @Nekros4442 SICK
[3:43:40] <%raychasetwitch> nope no ps5 for me. can't get my hands on one
[3:43:42] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Logitech controller is 20buchsk and solid
[3:43:42] <zerointelligence000> can you use a ps4 controller?
[3:43:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I don't own a PS5, I own a PS5 controller.
[3:43:49] <Kain5707> @raychasetwitch theres a demo on steam if you want to try it
[3:43:53] <%MidnightBurst12> me :)
[3:43:56] <Maids4lyfe> Pat you're like the only person who has a ps5
[3:43:57] <%KineticZen> Fucking scalpers
[3:44:00] <mismagilou> I just got one last week
[3:44:01] <+Rofiarf> ps5s aren't real Pat
[3:44:02] <%baka_sugoi> NotLikeThis PS5
[3:44:05] <+LacarisBarber> Still dont have a demons souls machine
[3:44:07] <%LaughingCatt> yup aeroCri
[3:44:10] <%SovPho> chip shortage is poopy
[3:44:10] <%Starotter70> Here's to 5 more years of not having one
[3:44:12] <%Agami23> you can get a dualsense controller without a ps5. thats what i did
[3:44:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> didn't yoshiP have to junp through hoops to get one?
[3:44:13] <Finakala> I lucked out on one by being there at just the right time last month but know others near me who can't find one at all
[3:44:16] <RyuuAoi> They aren't real, Pat!
[3:44:18] <+tr1ps_ax1om> @raychasetwitch you can still buy a ps5 controller and use on the pc.
[3:44:20] <AzureGale> I only know like one person who actually has a PS5
[3:44:21] <%CzeekyTV> Has the PS5 been scalped more than past consoles? Because it's still breaking sales records
[3:44:23] <+Stormzcales_Lair> PS5 are mytical
[3:44:24] <@QueequegTheater> Wait really? I just bought one on eBay.  It cost extra, but it was easy?
[3:44:24] <+CookieCutter007> who doesn't have 1500 dollars on hand to give to scalpers
[3:44:25] <Maids4lyfe> can we just arrest scalpers or something
[3:44:29] <%blink289> @ChrisPlaysThing I was the same way till I got lucky with amazon
[3:44:30] <PanicSwytch> @raychasetwitch How does it feel to play game you've VA for?
[3:44:31] <%Monkeyweed21> wait didnt Ray do voicework for the new Ratchet and Clank?
[3:44:31] <%cooldude69xx> @Rofiarf Pat's been faking and using his hate of seagulls as a mask
[3:44:35] <%baka_sugoi> Demon's Souls machine LUL
[3:44:36] <%SirGO0SE> ps6 waiting room
[3:44:37] <%Nekros4442> @Nekros4442 @baka_sugoi With a full party you basically get up to 6 Break attacks so you can loop up to 6 times as long as you dont get whacked
[3:44:37] <%Mattais88> If PS5's aren't real, are they made of birds?
[3:44:41] <%AllenDeadman> I read somewhere there is rumors of a PS5 Pro and I am just like "BITCH THERE ISN'T ENOUGH REGULAR PS5s"
[3:44:41] <%alphonseisbest> @CzeekyTV YES
[3:44:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm so glad i invested in mining companies who have properties with big numbers of critical elements LUL
[3:44:48] <+lag2993> as someone who works in retail id say most since scalpers keep using bots to buy them all
[3:44:53] <Blank9> it's always fun watching VAs play games they're in
[3:44:55] <+ScrapKingKeita> @Mattais88 They're made of seagulls
[3:44:57] <%greasypete00> how many scalpers just have several boxes of ps5's sitting around i wonder
[3:44:58] <+Vigonept> no ps5s arent real so theyre made of eyes
[3:44:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Gonna grab me a house in december
[3:45:01] <Finakala> Demon's Souls is worth it and I already beat it on PS3
[3:45:03] <Maids4lyfe> @Mattais88 yes because they're always flying off the shelves
[3:45:04] <%VitoXXI> it should be a diferent experience playing a game youve done voice work for
[3:45:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> theres already a superconductor shortage
[3:45:07] <fatlystackedmac> with what chips lmao
[3:45:07] <%Agami23> release a ps5 casual that can actually be bought
[3:45:08] <%deviljhojho_> the ps5 is barely out lol
[3:45:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> There's noting you can do about Scalping Electronics, except for not playing the game
[3:45:12] <SamuraiEdgeplay> You honestly just need to hope that Sony Direct sends you an email and gives you a 10min window to buy one. Only way I got it.
[3:45:14] <%baronouroboros> Scalpers? That's just the free market at work, baybee /s :V
[3:45:14] <%raychasetwitch> @PanicSwytch it's really surreal to actually see all the stuff you talked about for years come to life. we have no idea what the settings look like and only a glimpse of character art
[3:45:18] <Blank9> watched Kyle McCarley do 13 Sentinels, and Kai Teng's Yakuza 7 stream
[3:45:18] <brachydios777> How are PS5 sales with no one being able to get them?
[3:45:19] <%walternatorz> did you just run over a fish?
[3:45:22] <AzureGale> What if they make a new lien of PS5s but just call it the PS6
[3:45:23] <%SovPho> the ps5s work for the bourgeoisie
[3:45:26] <%greasypete00> LUL
[3:45:28] <%blink289> @greasypete00 probably enough for everyone who wants one to get one
[3:45:28] <ErikFeral> I've straight up gone back to PS3, just so my PS4 has a friend.
[3:45:38] <Aoworth> Lol why would they sell a pro version when they can't even source the fucking chips for the normal one?
[3:45:44] <@Ranryu692> that makes sense, but it's wild
[3:45:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> weird
[3:45:50] <%Kyma1020> it really is
[3:45:51] <%raychasetwitch> it's just looking at excel spreadsheets
[3:45:52] <Profmcstevie> Voicing a stranger
[3:45:55] <%strakillias> I have a PS5. Its pretty useless except for when a game comes out for it every 3 or 4 months
[3:45:57] <%cvp5127> cool
[3:46:04] <%deviljhojho_> "dunno lol"
[3:46:05] <%MashinChaserR> does vita still mean life?
[3:46:06] <Finakala> I mean, does anyone?
[3:46:08] <%baka_sugoi> IDK LUL
[3:46:10] <gunstars20> Oh boy LUL

[3:46:27] <%baka_sugoi> Great game too
[3:46:30] <%NopeBadguy> Laura Stahl?
[3:46:39] <Profmcstevie> "I can't wait to find out what the fuck I was talking about"
[3:46:40] <blackbookalpha> Laura Post
[3:46:40] <%Kyma1020> Laura Post
[3:46:40] <RyuuAoi> @mashinchaserr I mean it can!....naw. It's dead.
[3:46:40] <@QueequegTheater> @raychasetwitch Hey I do that at work too!
[3:46:40] <%Ghufufin> big brain play make you VA's buy the game to know what they voiced
[3:46:40] <@commanderclaw> Excel spreadsheets are holding up like, 90% of the industries in the world
[3:46:40] <wibbwobbler> LUL
[3:46:40] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Double Demon Fang when?
[3:46:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> I wouldn't be surprised if someone who beat the hame said they didn't know what happened in kt
[3:46:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I keep hearing Kratos say Demon Fang
[3:46:45] <@TheYellowcouch> Must be kinda cool tho to be able to mostly play something spoiler free
[3:46:48] <%Kyma1020> alotta Lauras
[3:46:49] <+ShutUpAceyP> is this just ff12?
[3:46:50] <+OhGodAGod> She also in this!
[3:46:53] <rasamune> @MashinChaserR It does if you jailbreak it
[3:46:53] <+ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt Speaking of Japanese PS5, a rather popular seinen manga artist in one of the afterwords to end the magazine, she said "I'm gonna go out and get a PS5 and then I'll start working on the manga chapters during hiatus." We are currently 300 days in.
[3:46:55] <+xeromage> So every voice actor you hire = 1 guaranteed sale
[3:46:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Laura from the Walking Dead
[3:47:02] <+Basker17> *woolie voice* yuki-chaaan~
[3:47:02] <Lynxystem> i took a voice acting class a few months back and yeah its just excel sheets with VERY basic descriptions chwKEK
[3:47:04] <fatlystackedmac> shout to Bethesda for giving vo actors scripts in alphabetical order
[3:47:07] <blackbookalpha> Valentine in Skullgirls
[3:47:10] <%fugly_nick> I like to imagine Jack Baker's VA not being told what was going on when they recorded the Jack's 55th Birthday lines in RE7
[3:47:12] <toahmes> Man imagine they announce a PS5 Pro and then scalpers can't sell all the base PS5s they're sitting on
[3:47:13] <brachydios777> 13 sentinels is so good
[3:47:14] <AzureGale> I still can't get enough of Shionne's Mass Effect gun
[3:47:15] <@Ranryu692> oh no Pat
[3:47:19] <%seththeslime> begulls
[3:47:20] <%RetroCop87> do you know how much time you would need to spoil someone on 13 Sentinels?
[3:47:20] <%Starotter70> Ah, the stinging birds
[3:47:21] <%MidnightBurst12> clearly
[3:47:21] <RyuuAoi> I play PSP more than I play Vita.
[3:47:22] <%cooldude69xx> What about the birds and bees pat?
[3:47:22] <%seththeslime> beegulls
[3:47:28] <Aoworth> Someone explain the birds and the bees to pat
[3:47:28] <Profmcstevie> These.....vicious seagulls
[3:47:31] <%Monkeyweed21> its the Jojo method of anti spoler where nothing sticks in your head without context
[3:47:33] <%baka_sugoi> TIME 4 GUURL
[3:47:34] <%MashinChaserR> that manga artist works on land of the lustrous right?
[3:47:34] <@Ranryu692> @seththeslime amazing
[3:47:34] <Madinki> Remember when the guy who voiced Kellog in Fallout 4 had NO IDEA what game he was voicing the character for or it's setting?
[3:47:35] <%Starotter70> "AH, IT'S A CAT!"
[3:47:36] <%Axellogic> So I passed out and just now woke how you liking the game?
[3:47:40] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He saw them with his Special Eyes, and knew that they were "bees"
[3:47:49] <%KaiserMario> I can't unsee Lucatiel's set on this guy...
[3:47:52] <@ssjklyco> They call them Bees, but they are shaped like Jays. Think about it
[3:48:01] <%RetroCop87> she gets better with more artes
[3:48:02] <%baka_sugoi> 360 no scope pat
[3:48:03] <+Basker17> The voice of Siri didnt know she was Siri until a few months after I believe
[3:48:04] <%raychasetwitch> @Madinki that was Keythe Farley, the director of ffxv!
[3:48:04] <%hamborgini> she's much better if you take off her healing abilities and replace them with attacks
[3:48:05] <@Ranryu692> @ssjklyco you can't make me
[3:48:07] <%AgniBrandt> Shionne gets more mechanics later
[3:48:07] <circular7> GUYS RELAX, bees are like huge birds to tiny pat LUL
[3:48:08] <%Starotter70> So a healer?
[3:48:08] <%ape_hawk> ye-yeah
[3:48:09] <RyuuAoi> @axellogic He likes it. He's grinding.
[3:48:09] <doggieo> That goes for most Magic users
[3:48:09] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt She's missing alot of her moves.
[3:48:10] <%cooldude69xx> @Madinki I feel like sometimes you could ask for more, right?
[3:48:10] <%Mattais88> Othe rparty memebers never are
[3:48:11] <%furiousfurioso> I know ive seen video of her doing WILD shit later on
[3:48:12] <%Axellogic> Ranged characters get progressively more fun usually
[3:48:12] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt IS there multiplayer in this like in symphonia?
[3:48:14] <%Starotter70> Kappa
[3:48:15] <+ALazo> she gets a bit better once she gets more skills, but yeah, I like sword guy better
[3:48:15] <AzureGale> Yeah that's ranged characters in action RPGs in a nutshell
[3:48:16] <$scallycap> is this Dragons Dogma 2?
[3:48:16] <+Vigonept> well yeah gunner
[3:48:16] <+NobuuNobuu> there is still part of her gameplay not unlocked yet
[3:48:17] <%alphonseisbest> ur not using her bombs
[3:48:19] <%Nekros4442> Shionne is a battle cleric
[3:48:19] <Profmcstevie> Casters are not as rad in my action gaming
[3:48:20] <Blank9> she's a healer, they're usually boring until later
[3:48:20] <Bustahhwulf> once u can special cancel artes mages are the best to play LUL
[3:48:20] <%Agami23> man i was looking at twitter and saw talk about an "among us fighting game" and i dont know what to think anymore.
[3:48:23] <%doomunderthestairs> I don't believe so
[3:48:25] <+kewlmyc> No there isn't.
[3:48:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Casters in Tales games take a while to get going
[3:48:27] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:48:28] <gunstars20> LOL
[3:48:29] <Focant> There isn't
[3:48:30] <%RayReborne> NOPE
[3:48:35] <Blank9> no multiplayer in this one
[3:48:37] <AzureGale> If I remember correctly there is no multiplayer
[3:48:37] <+matf8> she seems to be basically like sharla in xenoblade chronicled
[3:48:37] <RyuuAoi> Yeah she weak
[3:48:42] <ErikFeral> Healers Never Die. DPS, however...
[3:48:45] <%arcadianskypirate> that would be interesting though
[3:48:45] <%ape_hawk> nopers
[3:48:49] <%Starotter70> @Agami23 Sounds pretty sus to me
[3:48:50] <Blank9> fistfighters are usually the best
[3:48:52] <%CzeekyTV> The only actual PS5 game I've played on mine is Demon's Souls, I kinda feel bad for having one lol. It's mostly a "play PS4 games but at 60fps" machine for now
[3:48:57] <%KaiserMario> Tales multiplayer were always something I've never played LUL
[3:49:00] <AzureGale> Hear meflame of furburning strike
[3:49:12] <RyuuAoi> Multiplayer? In a JRPG? MaxLOL
[3:49:14] <%fugly_nick> Why's that lady got a gun in this fantasy looking setting?
[3:49:23] <ErikFeral> Don't wake up. You're Fat. I don't see the correlation
[3:49:29] <Blank9> I miss the multiplayer already, I have a friend I played the whole series with
[3:49:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> magic
[3:49:30] <%alphonseisbest> @CzeekyTV hey thats mostly the reason poeple want one to start with, the ps4 was a good ass gen
[3:49:30] <%RayReborne> pat u changed the difficulty remember?
[3:49:35] <+TheBitingIrish> Demon Fang Demon Fang Demon Fang Demon Fang Demon Fang Demon Fang
[3:49:37] <+kewlmyc> Demon fang exists to be spammed
[3:49:38] <%KaiserMario> @RyuuAoi You could control other characters during combat
[3:49:39] <%Axellogic> @fugly_nick YOu missed spaceships
[3:49:40] <%chiazam> DEMON FANG DEMON FANG DAMN I MUST BE A GENIUS DOUBLE DEMON FANG
[3:49:45] <brachydios777> Renan are aliens
[3:49:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @RyuuAoi previous Tales games had coop where other players took over your party
[3:49:46] <+psychotripstreams> Guns in fantasy are awesome
[3:49:49] <+supersonic21> I’m kinda glad I don’t have a ps5 yet because it would gather so much dust. Meanwhile on my series x I’m just able to play anything from ps2, GameCube, stuff on game pass. It’s good shit
[3:49:50] <Blank9> dmeon fang is the perfect filler for all ranges
[3:49:51] <gunstars20> That's the classic demon fang
[3:49:51] <@Ranryu692> @fugly_nick space nazis
[3:50:01] <%tank7013> @fugly_nick This is very much a sci-fantasy setting. You're fighting space nazis and bioengineered monsters
[3:50:11] <%baka_sugoi> CHAR
[3:50:13] <Whiteherox> char did nothing wrong
[3:50:13] <%RetroCop87> no, but Lala tho
[3:50:14] <%cooldude69xx> Char was right
[3:50:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> But Char was right, and the Earth was Racist
[3:50:23] <@commanderclaw> Nobody was right
[3:50:23] <AzureGale> @fugly_nick Gift from Commander Shepard
[3:50:25] <@Ranryu692> Pat you need to watch Char's Counterattack
[3:50:26] <tubit> char is as dumb as a butt
[3:50:27] <%Starotter70> Pat pushing his space racism
[3:50:30] <%raychasetwitch> man this music is great
[3:50:30] <%baronouroboros> hmm, we're on the moon huh
[3:50:32] <%Starotter70> once again
[3:50:34] <%GuilKato> Roche limit be damned! put a planet right next to another planet nothing will go wrong
[3:50:35] <RushUnplugged> Char? nah, it was mostly that Quattro Vagina guy
[3:50:36] <%hamborgini> Tha-
[3:50:37] <Madinki> @Madinki I think it was like he wasn't allowed to know what the series was about or the story to stop spoilers and only found out it was Fallout through someone else by chance.
[3:50:38] <Happydisaster> the fucks a fagan?
[3:50:38] <PanicSwytch> Char is a hero
[3:50:39] <brachydios777> God damn space traitors!
[3:50:40] <%baka_sugoi> SPACE
[3:50:40] <%ape_hawk> hes hungy
[3:50:45] <GilliamYaeger> COOKING TUTORIAL
[3:50:46] <%RetroCop87> The federation was racist, but Zeon was FUCKING NAZIS
[3:50:47] <%baronouroboros> oh no, more tropes
[3:50:47] <RyuuAoi> WAS Char wrong though?
[3:50:49] <roobanguy> how he eat with mask on tho

[3:51:08] <@TheYellowcouch> Spacism
[3:51:12] <+vaderxyz1970> Anahiem was the real bad guy of Gundam
[3:51:13] <%RetroCop87> OH GOD, THEY ARE TOTALLY ZEON
[3:51:16] <%baka_sugoi> This is why we can't have GUNDAM
[3:51:24] <%KaiserMario> Space racism??? IS THIS GUNDAM?
[3:51:25] <%cooldude69xx> @Madinki That makes sense. I figured that was what NDA's were for
[3:51:28] <@Ranryu692> fucking Cardies
[3:51:31] <%InternetShis> RABBIT POORS
[3:51:35] <%RonaldMcDownload> But their poors get to feel proud since they're better than the slaves
[3:51:36] <%AllenDeadman> I mean yeah
[3:51:37] <JunkyardCrow> Char was right, but dropping Axis on the planet to start a nuclear winter was bit much
[3:51:38] <%TheLemuroid> wut
[3:51:41] <@Spydurman> Space poors? In this economy??
[3:51:41] <radregice> how

[3:56:14] <%fugly_nick> Eat that shit and start breathing fire
[3:56:15] <%AllenDeadman> it might be lethal
[3:56:16] <+vaderxyz1970> He can't feel pain but can feel pleasure thats OP as Fck, Baldr would kill him out of jelousy
[3:56:16] <ashuckel> says in the label: IT WILL KILL YOU

[3:56:23] <RushUnplugged> "The Merciless Peppers of Quetzalacatenango … grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum."
[3:56:23] <mighty_fine_trousers> Just start using capsaicin extract
[3:56:25] <%KaiserMario> We can't grow it anywhere else, or it kills the fauna
[3:56:27] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> We might have just grew actual poison, but what if it's tasty?
[3:56:29] <Blank9> biologically made to destroy your ass
[3:56:32] <+matf8> are the tales games connected in any way, or is it like final fantasy?
[3:56:37] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Everything hotter than your basic buffalo hot wings sacrifices flavor for heat
[3:56:37] <%InternetShis> What kinda birds do Ghost Peppers fight off besides "all of them?"
[3:56:39] <rasamune> "is literally poison, let's see if we die from it"
[3:56:40] <AzureGale> Says on the label: "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU"
[3:56:41] <+JustToWatch> "we don't actually know how hot it is because the chemistry lab hasn't sent the results back yet"
[3:56:44] <mismagilou> @matf8 it's like FF
[3:56:47] <@ssjklyco> Pat, that pepper is real. It's litterally called Pepper X
[3:56:48] <%MrP33Ps> imagine the shits you would get
[3:56:48] <+TheBitingIrish> "We call this one 'Xenomorph Blood'"
[3:56:49] <%baronouroboros> Tales is like alt Final Fantasy really
[3:56:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> I want a Pepper that grows with the Flaming Hot Logo
[3:56:57] <auraoftheearth009> some are world wise
[3:56:57] <%baka_sugoi> apparently this is a soft reboot
[3:56:58] <AzureGale> Tales is kind of like Final Fantasy, in that most games are in tehir own universe
[3:56:58] <%baronouroboros> which is like alt Dragonquest in turn
[3:56:59] <%Kyma1020> more like Easter Eggs that can loosely connect
[3:57:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @matf8 in some of the games a magic penguin lets you fight the protags of another game
[3:57:04] <+MrBaldachin> you're always gonna have random callbacks/constants cuz that's just the japanese way
[3:57:05] <+armormog> or direct prequels
[3:57:06] <+Mrbaconator> @QueequegTheater naw secret aardvark is real good
[3:57:07] <+tr1ps_ax1om> Da Bomb is gross
[3:57:07] <%JoshManVGH> Berseria is a prequel to Zesteria... and I think that's it?

[4:03:14] <+aslfrasle> Pat, your box is teal/aqua

[4:03:35] <%polothegreatest> purple sunrise? CoolCat
[4:03:37] <%SovPho> this is cool
[4:03:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> remember how upset Pat was when he olearned how to pronounce turquoise?
[4:03:45] <%fugly_nick> THE GAMECUBE WAS PURPLE GUYS
[4:03:45] <%RayReborne> Pat it's been a picture of a Rainbow Gief Asshole for 5 hours
[4:03:48] <%SovPho> kinda chrono triggery
[4:03:50] <%SirGO0SE> never forget turkwise
[4:03:51] <%GalacticaPhanto> @blank9 Is the very first Tales of game for SNES. it has a silly crunchy audio of the villain yelling it
[4:03:56] <%RayReborne> Kappa
[4:03:59] <+tr1ps_ax1om> is this 120 on ps5?
[4:04:02] <+matf8> this combat system looks a lot like xenoblade chronicles and that's a good thing, xenoblade's very fun
[4:04:11] <%cooldude69xx> @rumtumtugnutz Oh man, was he saying Tur-kwah?
[4:04:16] <%alphonseisbest> @tr1ps_ax1om HARD 60 IIFC
[4:04:29] <GilliamYaeger> c-c-c-combo breaker
[4:04:29] <%baronouroboros> magna ray sonic thrust rising demon fang magna ray
[4:04:34] <T_SHAFE> Hey @PatStaresAt how do you get controllers to work wirelessly on PC? Shit won't stop disconnecting on me
[4:04:35] <CeJaxon> is this base enemy health or is this hard difficulty
[4:04:42] <@TheYellowcouch> This game really is well optimized so far
[4:04:44] <%Mattais88> Violins are always great in battle themes
[4:04:47] <roobanguy> so no mp in this one?
[4:04:49] <%SirGO0SE> @cooldude69xx turk wise
[4:04:53] <T_SHAFE> oop
[4:04:53] <+murilo182x> It's a good 60 but there's drops in combast
[4:04:55] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt if it's anything like symphonia you can do infinite combos if your team is coordinated enough
[4:04:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> WIRED only son
[4:04:58] <brachydios777> LUL
[4:04:59] <%topendbuzza> LUL
[4:05:01] <gunstars20> Quick get Doom hidden missiles assist
[4:05:03] <%cooldude69xx> @SirGO0SE ha
[4:05:03] <%blastyoboots> LUL
[4:05:04] <%Agami23> i want shion to end up with ironman's proton cannon from MvC2
[4:05:07] <Reanimator83> that's how I'm playing it
[4:05:10] <@ssjklyco> Wired or get external bluetooth adaptter
[4:05:17] <%fugly_nick> I have to use a bluetooth adaptor for mine
[4:05:18] <+ScrapKingKeita> there are some blue tooth controllers, but last I checked, they suck
[4:05:23] <%cvp5127> get a dongle
[4:05:23] <Owkono> what is the weapon system like in this game?
[4:05:27] <%alphonseisbest> @murilo182x on the ps5? how far in are u? all 6 members?
[4:05:28] <TheLocalRival> Pat for Wireless Support you need a Sony Bluetooth adapter king
[4:05:29] <AzureGale> Gotta get Phoenix Wright into Turnabout mode and tag him out
[4:05:38] <RyuuAoi> Connect your dick!
[4:05:51] <%SirGO0SE> the Xbox pc adapter is great
[4:05:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wired connections are the height of human tech
[4:06:01] <@Ranryu692> really? That sucks. I haven't had that problem
[4:06:05] <AzureGale> im tired of UR FAIC
[4:06:07] <Blank9> I use a mayflash dongle for wireless with my wii u pro controller
[4:06:08] <GeltonZ> This game hurts my soul. Lack of linear motion and directional inputs makes super sad to say nothing of the lack of multiplayer.
[4:06:16] <+Vigonept> fuck iron mask
[4:06:19] <+paladinstarbuster> tired of these hoes
[4:06:35] <roobanguy> LIMB systems pat! LIMB Systems!
[4:06:38] <%Agami23> old tales style
[4:06:38] <%chiazam> All this for clothes
[4:06:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> is that an old game thing
[4:06:39] <%RayReborne> aka Pre Arise Tales
[4:06:40] <%seththeslime> use pc controller made from old xbox original parts
[4:06:41] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wait, she's making you go through this just because she needs her Gucci shoes?
[4:06:41] <%baka_sugoi> fighting game inputs?
[4:06:43] <+apocplz> hurts your soul? nalvHuh
[4:06:45] <AzureGale> Past tales games had more 2D-esque cobat
[4:06:46] <%VitoXXI> the old tales gameplay?
[4:06:47] <%Monkeyweed21> he wants it to play like Old Tales
[4:06:48] <%MisterRockett> I think they mean the old 2D gameplay style.
[4:06:50] <@ssjklyco> Like Tekken
[4:06:51] <+PJSmooth> @PatStaresAt He means the old Linear Motion Battle System
[4:06:52] <@Spydurman> tank controls
[4:06:53] <+ScrapKingKeita> Older games
[4:06:56] <%Axellogic> Old games were on like 2d planes
[4:06:56] <@goose_attack_almanac> Tales used directional inputs for Artes
[4:06:58] <Mushinronja> Movement used to be forward and back with targeted enemy. And skills was direction+button rather than 3 buttons
[4:06:59] <GeltonZ> @PatStaresAt I mean the fact that you freely run around instead of moving on a 2D plane.
[4:07:01] <ohno778> superior limb based combat
[4:07:02] <%Nekros4442> There were ways to lock onto a single enemy and you would go straight towards or back that enemy in a line
[4:07:03] <Blank9> old tales games were 2D, and your artes were like smash bros attacks instead of different buttons
[4:07:03] <+kewlmyc> It's the name of the Tales battle systems.
[4:07:04] <%Qsmash_> limb based combat
[4:07:05] <homestylewaffles> @OneThousandTomatoes tales movement in combat used to be 2D, many many many many MANY years ago
[4:07:07] <+murilo182x> @alphonseisbest 4 members so far, but the bigger spells sometimes drop it to around 40
[4:07:08] <Blank9> I like this better
[4:07:11] <RushUnplugged> game is not like old bad games, so it bad
[4:07:12] <AzureGale> Just imagine smash inputs for artes
[4:07:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Old games worked on Soul Cal controls
[4:07:18] <%baronouroboros> You're finished wyvern sonic demon ray fury blast
[4:07:21] <rasamune> Have any of the 3D Tales games had multiplayer?
[4:07:21] <%Gelphaze> There are some things the future just can't fix you know.
[4:07:23] <RyuuAoi> Maybe he wants it on rails, .pat?
[4:07:24] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you have an idea if you'll be streaming this in full?
[4:07:26] <@goose_attack_almanac> not really 3d
[4:07:32] <%Deft_Thought> Good ole Line System
[4:07:37] <Profmcstevie> Isn't semi auto basically still like that
[4:07:37] <%Meekest> Yes
[4:07:38] <+Vigonept> new bad old good?
[4:07:38] <AzureGale> Yes
[4:07:40] <+NobuuNobuu> yes
[4:07:40] <%ape_hawk> yes
[4:07:41] <%baka_sugoi> L O N G
[4:07:41] <@Ranryu692> @rasamune Vesperia did. dunno about the others
[4:07:42] <%Bluwizard21> yes
[4:07:42] <%Deft_Thought> Very long, yes
[4:07:42] <%doublebagpilot> min 50 hours
[4:07:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they worked like Soul Cal
[4:07:43] <CeJaxon> 50 hours
[4:07:43] <%MisterRockett> 30-40 hours
[4:07:43] <%Taisuru> Hey Tales people, I remember a game very similar to the 2D Tales games for GBA with a crafting focus, anyone know the name and know if it was actually any good?
[4:07:44] <%cvp5127> the longest
[4:07:44] <brachydios777> Yes
[4:07:45] <+megaman_sentinel> yes
[4:07:45] <%MisterRockett> No
[4:07:45] <%Bluwizard21> like 300 hours
[4:07:45] <Ner234> Yes
[4:07:45] <%Mattais88> yes
[4:07:46] <+kewlmyc> This is 30 hours apparantly
[4:07:46] <GilliamYaeger> Yes
[4:07:46] <RushUnplugged> they can be pretty chonky
[4:07:47] <@goose_attack_almanac> new game
[4:07:47] <%Shikari21> yeah usually
[4:07:47] <%Monkeyweed21> tes
[4:07:47] <%VitoXXI> yes
[4:07:47] <@ssjklyco> Okami levels long
[4:07:50] <Profmcstevie> They meaty, 40+
[4:07:50] <roobanguy> its the weird system the older tales game where you ran on a 2d plane unless you held a button which gives you full motion in battle, but makes it nigh impossible to hit people in that mode
[4:07:52] <%RayReborne> the last one was 80 hours without all side quests for me
[4:07:53] <%alphonseisbest> @murilo182x oh wow looking forward to, that
[4:07:54] <%Meekest> 50-80
[4:07:54] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Depends on how much side missions you do
[4:07:56] <+ScrapKingKeita> About as long Yakuzies 7
[4:07:56] <%Monkeyweed21> 40-50 hours
[4:07:56] <@goose_attack_almanac> mass effect
[4:07:56] <AzureGale> But imagine all the CONTENT
[4:07:57] <%MisterRockett> They're 40-50 hours guys.
[4:08:00] <%walternatorz> mass effect?
[4:08:00] <%baka_sugoi> no more heros
[4:08:01] <@Ranryu692> ME3

[4:08:08] <%topendbuzza> pat will do them all
[4:08:08] <%GuilKato> Mass Effect 3
[4:08:09] <%MisterRockett> INCREDIBLY long is like, 100 Tales games aren't that long.

[4:08:26] <blackjack8182> Around the length of Mass Effect
[4:08:28] <+apocplz> the goblins
[4:08:34] <%KaiserMario> I'm not lying tho!
[4:08:34] <%alphonseisbest> i wouls just like to see u get to the first Lord
[4:08:37] <GeltonZ> I got in with Eternia so what I want is an RPG with a 4-Player Co-Op 2D fighter for a battle system. So I actually want full 2D again. But all the good 2D ones were denied US release.
[4:08:39] <RyuuAoi> I'd say 80 on this one. I haven't touched it but Pat gonna do all mission.
[4:08:44] <%RayReborne> @misterrockett accurate
[4:08:47] <%MisterRockett> @churropoppa I finished that around 40.
[4:08:48] <ohno778> WHO IS RASICIM?

[4:09:26] <%MisterRockett> I do NOT know where people got the idea that Tales games were long it must be the crazy people who literally 100% it and then tell people that's how long it takes to "finish" the game.

[4:13:15] <%RealThiele> so not sane
[4:13:16] <+xerotwo> Is Pat playing as Helmet Bro?
[4:13:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> 6 hours in
[4:13:20] <RyuuAoi> Give her wings, Pat!
[4:13:20] <%baka_sugoi> pat hates bunny gurls
[4:13:22] <+Jack8274> Soon
[4:13:24] <%Deft_Thought> Noooo, keep the helmet forever
[4:13:26] <+Basker17> Pat wants the Monado Blade
[4:13:29] <%RayReborne> 10 Seconds
[4:13:30] <%fugly_nick> He's gonna take that mask off and reveal another mask, Master Chief style
[4:13:31] <ohno778> 6 hours
[4:13:37] <+KingpinLarry> How long has Pat been playing this?
[4:13:37] <%Mattais88> turn the mask into a sword
[4:13:40] <notsoy> i guess the tiara is just cosmetic then?
[4:13:41] <%Monkeyweed21> just use the flame sword to melt your mask into slag 4head
[4:13:41] <%RealThiele> BOOBA BLADE
[4:13:48] <%hamborgini> some accessories are character-specific
[4:13:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> @king_wragles all stream
[4:13:57] <ammobasket> The mask just reveals his shiny robot face

[4:15:45] <%cooldude69xx> You do not
[4:15:47] <gunstars20> LUL
[4:15:48] <%AllenDeadman> either the 50% mark or 90%
[4:15:50] <+matf8> 4 hours is nothing
[4:15:50] <%topendbuzza> LUL
[4:15:50] <Mushinronja> try Valkyrie Profile 1

[4:15:55] <%Meekest> Bro Persona 5 is like 15 hours for the opening
[4:15:56] <%akscully> gief agrees
[4:15:57] <%AllenDeadman> 8 hours man
[4:15:58] <+ScrapKingKeita> wasn't Yakuza 1 like, 3 hours before you got to the main  play area?
[4:15:58] <L3m0nTwi5t> He's not wrong
[4:16:01] <%TheQuadrupleS> yeyeyeyeye
[4:16:02] <Owkono> I liked the Bunny ears better...
[4:16:05] <RLT917> jaboodyLUL
[4:16:05] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, at least there's combat. You get 4 hours into P4 before getting to combat
[4:16:05] <puse9> persona 5 has a long ass intro!
[4:16:06] <%alphonseisbest> @raychasetwitch wait theres more?! LUL
[4:16:09] <+ScrapKingKeita> Yakuza LAD, not Yakuza 1
[4:16:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> tons of games have had multi hour intros lately
[4:16:13] <+KingpinLarry> I've played 3 and 5 and SMT 4... haven't beat any yet.
[4:16:17] <%AllenDeadman> 8 hours going fast on P5R
[4:16:18] <%Taisuru> @Owkono Don;t make me get the bat
[4:16:19] <%RayReborne> That summer vacation tho! watermelon, the beach
[4:16:21] <IntrepidEye> Hell look at Divinity 2. The "tutorial" is 20 hours long
[4:16:21] <+SuperOffensiveStudios> did I miss Pat hearing about the new China ban?
[4:16:24] <%RayReborne> Sick kickflips
[4:16:26] <+murilo182x> I have a friend who says it took him a week to finish P5s tutorial
[4:16:27] <vonmaultke> uh, uh, uh, take this!, its over!, That this!, uh, uh
[4:16:27] <%MisterRockett> Depends on if you wanna get Watermelon on the beach.
[4:16:30] <%MisterRockett> Which you always do.
[4:16:31] <%LaughingCatt> KH2 is only 3 LUL its long been outclassed in intro length
[4:16:31] <%RayReborne> KH Kickflips
[4:16:36] <%SovPho> You have to beat the game for Nier Automata's intro
[4:16:37] <RyuuAoi> Dude, Play Persona. Pat isn't lying. Sometimes two years older.
[4:16:37] <%chiazam> We STILL haven’t gotten to a BOSS battle yet
[4:16:39] <%Deft_Thought> Can you Demon Fang in the air?
[4:16:43] <%furiousfurioso> there's one in the skill point store
[4:16:43] <UnsteadyFunk> This battle music slaps tho
[4:16:47] <Aoworth> FFXII just forced me to accept bunny women just being a completely ordinary thing for JRPG characters
[4:16:54] <L3m0nTwi5t> Put bunny ear on masked man
[4:16:55] <+ScrapKingKeita> probably 40 hour if you just play through campaign
[4:16:57] <%ape_hawk> 50 hours if you 100% it
[4:16:59] <%Caped_Eggy> It's more like 60hrs
[4:17:01] <%Ghufufin> probably a 40 hr min play through
[4:17:02] <Profmcstevie> 5 regions in 40 hours? hmmmmm
[4:17:05] <TheLocalRival> Why do I have a feeling the protagonist is a hybrid of the two different races
[4:17:06] <%Valdorick> Tales games do tend to go "Slow slow slow OKAY NOW END IT"
[4:17:07] <%fugly_nick> HLTB says 40-50 hours
[4:17:07] <+RobotCo_Op> 62 raiders from RobotCo_Op have joined! 
[4:17:09] <%Monkeyweed21> full completion is more like 70+
[4:17:11] <puse9> maybe they can't play well?
[4:17:12] <%Taisuru> Bunny ears for masked man now
[4:17:13] <@TheYellowcouch> dw you'll bang it out in 40 hours
[4:17:16] <%RayReborne> yeah with this opening I don't believe that and I'm only an hour ahead of Pat
[4:17:17] <RyuuAoi> Lies.
[4:17:21] <%moonmintparadise> You didnt believe us when we told you that RE8 was shorter than you thought
[4:17:26] <%GarbageNirvana> 40 hours if you beeline it probably
[4:17:29] <@ssjklyco> If you do Story Mode dificulty, maybe
[4:17:31] <%AllenDeadman> there is no way this game is 50
[4:17:34] <Parapattern> Potato
[4:17:37] <%Deft_Thought> BOOO LALAFELL, BOO
[4:17:37] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Gotta go fast
[4:17:38] <Forbidden_Karp> I thought that was a village named Potato
[4:17:46] <blackjack8182> 40! Do the side quests off stream should be much less than that
[4:17:48] <%RayReborne> 50 maybe, but definitely not 40
[4:17:49] <+RoByte2> Odds on that town being on fire when you return?
[4:17:50] <%shurtal> This game has lalafells!?!?
[4:17:53] <%tank7013> Pat you've been raided
[4:17:53] <%topendbuzza> raid btw pat
[4:17:58] <%colezone_> I think it's possible this game has really fast pacing for a tales game
[4:17:59] <@ssjklyco> Symphonia was advertised as 80+. Modern tales is proably more than that now
[4:17:59] <TheLocalRival> Does anyone know when Vesperia ends. Been playing it for a while, pls help.
[4:18:01] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@KaiserMario) (warning)

[4:26:17] <%fugly_nick> You might have to bring her back from death's abyss next
[4:26:20] <%rbakervv> @PatStaresAt you can fast travel back to town to rest, or use orange gels to get mana back
[4:26:29] <%hamborgini> orange gel will restore CP
[4:26:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> it's getting to the point where early enemies are chumps now?
[4:26:33] <%doublebagpilot> orange gel？

[4:26:46] <+Breezeplease> Nice
[4:26:52] <gunstars20> The village can wait LUL
[4:26:53] <AzureGale> "Hold on let me go back to my hometown to rest"
[4:26:55] <+kewlmyc> Yeah Orange gels restore CP, and you can use items in battle for healing
[4:26:58] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Casters in Tales games kinda suck until a certain level then they get stupid OP

[4:27:07] <%RealThiele> montage

[4:27:17] <%KineticZen> Those look more like sweet potatoes than regular ones
[4:27:19] <Blank9> she can at least 100% lame it out if you manually use her to shoot and run
[4:27:21] <+Breezeplease> I tried to get into berseria, but the combat felt stilted. Hopefully this one scratches a good itch
[4:27:28] <StuccBoi> you can press triangle on the map and you can tp stairght to the inn
[4:27:33] <RyuuAoi> I'm hangry but I don't want McDicks BibleThump

[4:28:13] <%RayReborne> @slatersev yeah I agree, can't wait to get to her in the main game
[4:28:30] <+Breezeplease> Would Orange Gel be more like a pulp or a jello?

[4:28:39] <SamuraiEdgeplay> yeah real heavy man in the iron mask vibes
[4:28:42] <$sleepystardewfarmer> you can't fight evil on an empty stomach :)
[4:28:42] <@Ranryu692> what if he had crossed the right line?
[4:28:46] <AzureGale> Good thing they didn't cross the right line
[4:28:53] <%tank7013> Damn I think the backswing is still active
[4:28:53] <%JonathLP> His sword at the end of his swing behind his back
[4:28:59] <%cooldude69xx> @Breezeplease The juice, but one large pulp
[4:29:05] <%Wallabri> "you crossed the wrong line" implies there is, in fact, a RIGHT line to cross sofieThink

[4:29:20] <%fugly_nick> Jesus that dude could not catch a break
[4:29:20] <%topendbuzza> the wrong implies there are right lines to cross
[4:29:21] <%doublebagpilot> high score
