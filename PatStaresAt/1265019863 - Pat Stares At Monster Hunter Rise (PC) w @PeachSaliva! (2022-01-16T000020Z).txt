[0:17:58] <%The_Protagonist> The_Protagonist subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Saw you have to do 3000 Endwalker elite hunts (combinaton of A and S ranks) to get the Gief mount... can't you only get 1 EW elite per week and it's RANDOM if it's a high rank or not? That's a *major* goal to shoot for, how does that work? thepro95Emil
[0:17:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why does highlighting a message not actually highlight a message anymore?
[0:17:59] <%Bailey__Gaming> just dont Hunt Geif

[0:18:06] <%genocidal_cupcake> He's getting in character for the stream
[0:18:07] <DaKnightWarrior> Elder Dragon Gief
[0:18:08] <+OctaivianRex> He is, genetically.
[0:18:09] <+dcobra22322> Gief.... RL Monster Hunter LUL
[0:18:09] <Aussie_Manny> He sounds like a sweet baby.
[0:18:10] <+bytex678> Better call Geralt
[0:18:10] <Ipsenscastle> Gief is a Rancor monster
[0:18:13] <%TheWinged7> Geifs clearly just a Dodogama
[0:18:15] <farrellcityking> He always wants to play during the stream

[0:21:38] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[0:21:38] <%W1nterTitan> @bytex678 lytBLUSH
[0:21:40] <Profmcstevie> That was the PROBLEM
[0:21:42] <Profmcstevie> REAL PEOPLE
[0:21:44] <TheFramedWarlock> Lmao that's a lie
[0:21:44] <Aussie_Manny> I've heard... iffy things about that game.
[0:21:45] <@QueequegTheater> That's hella on fleek
[0:21:48] <@SoFarFetched> "I know this guy who is streaming RIGHT NOW"
[0:21:48] <%arizenarkana> Relatable
[0:21:49] <+lumporr> The West Wing has great dialogue that is not human at all
[0:21:49] <%RNGbob> @PatStaresAt is the Denuvo Anti-tamper worth worrying about?
[0:21:49] <%baka_sugoi> HU MAN?
[0:21:50] <+Mrbaconator> i feel like it sounds like he means like organic
[0:21:51] <%TerpanderLux> zangief monkaS
[0:21:56] <+chiazam> The problem is it’s teenage real people WHICH SUCKS
[0:21:58] <Ell1ot> i saw the streamer friendly version of a scene and it looked silly
[0:22:00] <+M0untain_wolf> Humans sound like that to Pat
[0:22:02] <%2DSuperiority> very cringe, lose subscriber
[0:22:07] <%VictorVonLouche> Its so dumb
[0:22:08] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> The 1st one
[0:22:10] <+Mrbaconator> it's pretty pretentious
[0:22:10] <@commanderclaw> Thanks Diana Troy and TNG
[0:22:11] <+lumporr> TROI, WHAT'S THIS GUY YELLING ABOUT?
[0:22:13] <+Pachi3000> Steven Universe
[0:22:13] <%RetroCop87> like that one planeteer
[0:22:14] <Tracazoid> The hoomon speech
[0:22:14] <%Shonen_hero> you mean telepathy?
[0:22:16] <%IamGrapes> the power of empathy that's not actally empathy?
[0:22:16] <$Trenr> it's hilarious
[0:22:16] <%Ne1son> "As an empath" gag me with a spoon melissa
[0:22:17] <+lumporr> "HE'S UPSET"
[0:22:18] <%VictorVonLouche> Its such a non power.
[0:22:18] <%baka_sugoi> The power to FEEL
[0:22:20] <Ipsenscastle> the MAGIC POWER of understanding how people feel
[0:22:22] <%JustToWatch> with the power of empathy, we can give a bird anxiety
[0:22:23] <Aussie_Manny> Oh right, that's her power, isn't it?
[0:22:23] <+M0untain_wolf> Empathy is a goddam SSS tire
[0:22:24] <Profmcstevie> I don't engage with "real people" characterisation, I'm here for humanity not reality
[0:22:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I checked out the game. It sucks ass
[0:22:24] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> if they speak in paragraphs they're not human.
[0:22:25] <%XelanArdel> hate that they call it that and not mind reading
[0:22:25] <%blistexthief> My crystals are giving off major empath vibes right now
[0:22:26] <%McSoliace> if you don't have it you have issues
[0:22:28] <TacoSaIad> I'm sensing upsetedness.
[0:22:28] <%arizenarkana> The name is wrong, yes.
[0:22:28] <%Shonen_hero> it's super empathy
[0:22:29] <TheFramedWarlock> It's a thing non-sociopaths have
[0:22:32] <%JoshManVGH> It's rarer than you think!
[0:22:32] <%luftraumm1> the power most humans already have
[0:22:33] <dr_lucien_sanchez_> Nice T shirt Pat
[0:22:34] <%PatNTheHat> Being able to sense people's emotion? Lame. Being able to CHANGE people's emotions? Possibly pretty cool
[0:22:34] <%YakumoYomi> Not for sociopaths, it isn't Kappa
[0:22:35] <%RetroCop87> I sense your upset Will
[0:22:35] <Ape_Law> are you sure man, have you met most people?
[0:22:35] <@commanderclaw> "I'm feeling great pain" says Diana as the ship is on fire
[0:22:36] <%GallowsDrop> it is Pat?
[0:22:39] <MadsSunny_> Shooting negative energy to harm empaths
[0:22:39] <%hairtoday> hah troi
[0:22:40] <@Ranryu692> Deanna's the worst
[0:22:42] <+Kalz0ne> I don't feel like any game ever feels like real people talking. Wheres the 3 mins of awkward silence, or flubbing an entire sentence
[0:22:42] <%VictorVonLouche> People who are perspective can get a read on that EASY
[0:22:43] <%baka_sugoi> I mean some people don't FEEL
[0:22:45] <%Shonen_hero> empathy just means you have functioning mirror neurons
[0:22:45] <+Mrbaconator> i have the super power of a layer of biological matter keeping particulate matter from getting inside my body @PatStaresAt
[0:22:45] <+chiazam> (Me an empath) What’re you talking about we’re special
[0:22:46] <%strakillias> Man Troi can't even do her job right with empathic powers
[0:22:47] <T_Sasquatch> Excuse me , Im an EMPATH
[0:22:48] <Senselessvirus> do they though? DO THEY?
[0:22:48] <%invisi_bliss> LUL
[0:22:50] <MoonKing> a frighteningly low amount of people have palpable empathy
[0:22:52] <Exeerdna> It's the same power Jean Grey has
[0:22:56] <%Agami23> yeah but theres a difference between feeling empathy and feeling all of someones emotions
[0:22:58] <+SpinalWizard> "I am sensing some emotion, captain"
[0:22:58] <Make_me_mad> Empathy is only cool when it's an actual superpower, like the new life is strange, where you read minds with it and STEAL EMOTIONS to make people dead inside.
[0:22:58] <Mattais88> Take that Troi!
[0:22:59] <%oda_flobunaga> Me an empath taking on his sadness, now I'm sad
[0:22:59] <%blistexthief> God damn Jupiter is fucking with my empath powers today
[0:23:01] <MadsSunny_> Imma be horny around empaths
[0:23:02] <%SharkMissile> Lmao what
[0:23:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> 😡
[0:23:04] <@Ranryu692> what
[0:23:04] <%XzileGaming> @dr_lucien_sanchez_ its a brand new shirt
[0:23:04] <@commanderclaw> Also FUCK JEAN GREY, SHE'S EVIL
[0:23:04] <%TerpanderLux> he was based for that one
[0:23:04] <%FacetiousAF> HI BAILEY
[0:23:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> take that empaths
[0:23:09] <@ssjklyco> Us in tech support develop that from hearing people bitch on the phone.
[0:23:12] <Profmcstevie> Thoughts of "you're a bitch"
[0:23:16] <%OrangeMDT> People have strength too, but there’s super strength for a reason
[0:23:19] <spicygoose> how are you today?
[0:23:23] <%JustToWatch> turning on all the microwaves in an IKEA to harm the empaths
[0:23:24] <%McSoliace> i'm going to do that from now on
[0:23:27] <%Bailey__Gaming> Choo Chooo PriHypeLove1 Prime Subs give me my name read out TWICE a month woo
[0:23:28] <%Shonen_hero> if everyone is an empath, what does that make Troi? Isn't her power basically that?
[0:23:29] <%solracc25> Metion told countless civilizations to just "you should do it man, jump"
[0:23:29] <%Pappajimbo> Only a fool fights David Lynch on the Astral Plane
[0:23:30] <%Munechira> @PatStaresAt you got it right
[0:23:32] <%FacetiousAF> @MadsSunny_ the best way to do this is to just be horny ALL THE TIME just in case
[0:23:32] <T_Sasquatch> @MoonKing i think empathy varies based on the subject and situation
[0:23:37] <Exeerdna> true @commanderclaw
[0:23:43] <%TerpanderLux> join a hunt train :)

[0:25:38] <%XzileGaming> she tried
[0:25:39] <BigYanno> If Discord breaks could you communicate with her using 2 tin cans and some string?
[0:25:39] <%Shonen_hero> that's as many as two 40 percents
[0:25:40] <+ikantreeed> talking to someone in who's in the same house on discord is hilarious to me

[0:33:42] <%oda_flobunaga> If this falls apart, will Peach stream God of Vore do you think?
[0:33:48] <%JoshManVGH> The counter motion to TV Streaming, will be Pet Streaming. Where it's just hours of peoples pets on camera. And that's fine!
[0:33:49] <%W1nterTitan> lytJIVE lytJIVE
[0:33:50] <+OctaivianRex> @stratrat13 That's exactly what happens.

[0:33:57] <Estuko> @TrevIn3Dimensions Right, jut grab a nice decent set to last ya till High Rank then you still won't have to worry till you get like maybe 50% of the quests through in High Rank where the monsters are a little meaner.
[0:34:02] <%TerpanderLux> when the monster is hunted
[0:34:05] <yourliteraldog> They do get vored in that game
[0:34:07] <%Dakuu75> MHR Question: How do I send an SoS Flare type thing? the "Request Join" is always greyed out in the field
[0:34:17] <thunderborn32> oh so rise will be her first not world; interesting
[0:34:28] <+OctaivianRex> @Nobrev Disable the Steam Nintendo button layout fix thing and then switch A/B with the ingame menu. Worked for me.
[0:34:30] <TrevIn3Dimensions> @TrevIn3Dimensions excellent thank you chat
[0:34:37] <LucasTheDrgn> @Dakuu75 You don't to go on missions with people you have to pre-make parties
[0:34:44] <%JoshManVGH> @nobrev You should be able to change the button mapping in settings
[0:34:46] <+OctaivianRex> @Nobrev And use button layout 5 I think.
[0:34:47] <stratrat13> @OctaivianRex lol hopefully she streams demons souls soon again love watching that game
[0:35:05] <MelfinaStarwind> I might have to boot up rise now fhaeLurk

[0:36:01] <Tatsabutt> @Dakuu75 Wrong info, when you start a quest you can pick whether it's your pre-made party only or the sos flare thing is enabled and people will join later on

[0:37:29] <+JenovasPuppet> HAMMER
[0:37:30] <MelfinaStarwind> ye
[0:37:31] <LucasTheDrgn> items don't get consumed when you use them in the training room! Test out those demondrugs!
[0:37:32] <Treasure_Vault> Hammer #1, good choice
[0:37:34] <+Pachi3000> Here's the basics: smash
[0:37:40] <%sendart> bonk monster head

[0:38:05] <sheepymcsheeperton> I'm so excited for this
[0:38:12] <%Dakuu75> @Tatsabutt does it matter if it's a village quest or hub quest?
[0:38:15] <LUvvUcy> luvvucQuieres B B B
[0:38:23] <+Pachi3000> damage happens
[0:38:24] <stratrat13> @OctaivianRex xD i remember world my first mh i looked forward to it enough to do homework watching guides on every weapon so not knowing anything is gonna take awhile
[0:38:28] <artificiallynatural> YEAH MASH
[0:38:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> She's gonna forget all of this in 30 seconds
[0:38:30] <%GameNomadMesey> Might as well use my monthly sub on these clowns swinging wappy sticks
[0:38:31] <%cartakus> Big bang attack
[0:38:32] <%TheAntiNihilist> TheAntiNihilist subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! nice seein lots of variety on the channel for now.  Sure would be swell to see GOTY contender no more heroes three get like 2 more streams to see a completion to Suda 51's magnum opus.Stay healthy and enjoy my slimy, bloody 1 month premature stream baby
[0:38:36] <Ner234> UNGA BUNGA
[0:38:38] <Tatsabutt> Dakuu75 yes, village quests are single player only and sub quests are (meant to be) multiplayer, although you can solo them
[0:38:40] <stratrat13> for paige
[0:38:44] <%GinAndRoses> psaBig bang
[0:38:44] <%Nobrev> @Dakuu75 village quests are single player only I think
[0:38:49] <hotonthetale> B¹⁰
[0:38:59] <%TerpanderLux> hammers so damn fun in this game when you learn all of it intricacies
[0:39:02] <+AWr00tBear> For the hammer just spam the wire bug art for big damage
[0:39:11] <+Orcapugs> Thanks coachpatterson
[0:39:19] <GrahamBaxter> I was having trouble telling what Paige's character looked like at the resolution I'm watching at, I'm kind of mad the easiest way to tell character body type is to check if their wearing pants.
[0:39:22] <Tatsabutt> Dakuu75 you can think of the village quests as a greatly extended tutorial, and finishing it will put you at the start of high rank (high rank being hub only, that's where the meat of the game is)
[0:39:28] <+skm742> R2 out of walking = good for hammer
[0:39:30] <%JenovasPuppet> Greatest Hammer combo: MASH
[0:39:36] <%whatsittoya> hammer go bonk got it..

[0:40:03] <%JenovasPuppet> That's MonHun Saliva for sure.
[0:40:03] <yourliteraldog> Coach Patterson sounds like someone who was hurting the kids the hold time.
[0:40:06] <%greasypete00> special eyes
[0:40:07] <stratrat13> charged hammer upper cut is for big strong hunters and is just awesome
[0:40:09] <%blastyoboots> Oh my god it's your character's female twin!  Just like she's your female cousin in real life!
[0:40:11] <%baka_sugoi> ANIME EYES
[0:40:13] <+OctaivianRex> You'll need it to compensate for your real sight.
[0:40:16] <GrahamBaxter> Seriously though, why can't lady hunters get some decent trousers?!
[0:40:21] <+imthewisejanitor> "You look like a freak in cutscenes" "Uh"
[0:40:26] <%CopperTucker> My Hunter looked great in CC but he looked like a MASSIVE ASSHOLE in cutscenes and it's great
[0:40:31] <Tatsabutt> Dakuu75 no worries! Other helpful things are: do the trading with rondine, eat before every quest, and check on the cohoot nest in the buddy plaza on top of the tree
[0:40:39] <Tatsabutt> regularly*
[0:40:40] <stratrat13> shhhhhhh
[0:40:42] <+Pachi3000> if you hit your dodge button while running away
[0:40:51] <%TerpanderLux> B
[0:40:56] <%TerpanderLux> A yeah oops
[0:40:57] <MelonSouda> An "oh shit fuck me run"
[0:40:58] <yourliteraldog> Oh shit this game got nice textures
[0:41:01] <stratrat13> bc it boosts morale @GrahamBaxter

[0:41:12] <Profmcstevie> Just say "Left face button" goddammit
[0:41:12] <%Dakuu75> @Tatsabutt appreciate the tips. thanks again.
[0:41:18] <%RustyCoyoteA> Did you set Paige’s weapon to auto sheathe or manual? @patstaresat
[0:41:19] <@ssjklyco> This is going to be a great stream.
[0:41:19] <%Bluwizard21> bug moves are super dank
[0:41:22] <thunderborn32> training hall infinite potions
[0:41:23] <tanarath> BIG invul frames, nice
[0:41:30] <%alphonseisbest> @Profmcstevie chilll out
[0:41:30] <LucasTheDrgn> Items don't get consumed in the practice area, so they're not getting wasted
[0:41:31] <+OctaivianRex> "Figured out"
[0:41:37] <+patel347> default settings are bad for this
[0:41:43] <+zenraider> i speak with face button terms to avoid that lol
[0:41:49] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:41:49] <%TerpanderLux> i hate controllers man
[0:41:53] <Tatsabutt> Dakuu75 no biggie! I love MH but it's so complex that it takes a long time to get into it, but when you do it's really great
[0:41:56] <+Pachi3000> yeah it's weird
[0:41:56] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt in the options you can make item swap D-pad; it may be easier to transition from darksouls for her that way
[0:41:57] <stratrat13> so i hope everyone is ready for re5 pat and not leaving the training area for 2 streams to train paige
[0:41:59] <+Pachi3000> yo get used to it
[0:42:05] <+ikantreeed> wet
[0:42:06] <LUvvUcy> Real talk having someone help you get into Monster Hunter is the best way to learn the controls
[0:42:07] <+OctaivianRex> Using the same kind of controller might been a good idea.
[0:42:07] <@Fuggins4U> yep, she's got it

[0:43:04] <%charp35> Sharpen your dull weapon
[0:43:05] <+Pachi3000> There are two yellow bars
[0:43:06] <%blastyoboots> no the SWORD one not the stamina bar pat
[0:43:08] <+healnavi> that's not the yellow bar
[0:43:09] <BinaryShuffle> There are two yellow bars pat
[0:43:10] <%Noir_Valdr> Pat the stamina bar is  also yellow
[0:43:14] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:43:14] <%tank7013> She is 100% percent looking at stamina right now
[0:43:14] <%Kaask> yellow bar means stamina
[0:43:15] <+Pachi3000> You mean the yellow bar that looks like a sword
[0:43:16] <+Shikari21> i hate it too
[0:43:16] <+ALazo> oh boi she's gonna think stamina is sharpness
[0:43:18] <+OctaivianRex> It's the sword icon specifically.
[0:43:18] <%blastyoboots> Pat she's gonna get confused it's not the "yellow bar"
[0:43:19] <stratrat13> omg she thinks stamina.  pat stamina is yellow!!!!!!!1
[0:43:20] <Ner234> I can feel Paige's brain melting already LUL
[0:43:20] <%TerpanderLux> its annoying at first but you get used to it
[0:43:21] <TehMud> Yes you sharpen hammers
[0:43:21] <@Fuggins4U> @thunderborn32 tru dat
[0:43:22] <+Pachi3000> PAT
[0:43:22] <@ssjklyco> I appreciate it's more clear in Rise
[0:43:24] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> I guarantee she is looking at the stamina bar
[0:43:29] <Aussie_Manny> The yellow bar that looks like a sword.
[0:43:29] <%JenovasPuppet> LUL
[0:43:33] <MelonSouda> Sharpness = Sword bullets
[0:43:34] <%JenovasPuppet> Your other yellow!
[0:43:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> There are 2 yellow bars inside you
[0:43:37] <+kewlmyc> PAAAAAATTTTTT
[0:43:41] <+Pachi3000> Well that's not what you said, Pat LUL
[0:43:43] <%TerpanderLux> the bar with all the colours is sharpness
[0:43:43] <@Fuggins4U> that's you WAH WAHmina
[0:43:45] <%FacetiousAF> there's the sword bar
[0:43:46] <Profmcstevie> There are two bars inside you
[0:43:46] <@QueequegTheater> IS IT BLUE OR PURPLE
[0:43:50] <stratrat13> theres 3 colors to sharpness
[0:43:51] <MrNoobMcSalt> The Sword Bar
[0:43:52] <@commanderclaw> "Paige, to smack the monster, you must learn to think" "Oh no"
[0:43:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> the yellow sword
[0:43:56] <%blastyoboots> thank you pat <3
[0:43:57] <stratrat13> with the weapon you have
[0:43:57] <Treasure_Vault> Sharper the weapon = higher damage multiplier
[0:44:02] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Knew it
[0:44:06] <+ikantreeed> come on pat
[0:44:07] <+mechslayer71> this is going well
[0:44:07] <%solracc25> sword bar

[0:44:09] <ohno778> derp
[0:44:10] <Aussie_Manny> ⚔
[0:44:10] <@Fuggins4U> sometimes your best just ain't enuff, pardner
[0:44:16] <@ssjklyco> How does a hammer become dull?
[0:44:19] <%BinaryFireball> wait so whats the bar next to the stamina bar???
[0:44:27] <%TerpanderLux> this game is hard to teach for a complete beginner
[0:44:27] <athuramn> look at this master class in mh
[0:44:28] <@Fuggins4U> @ssjklyco runs out of stories to tell
[0:44:33] <stratrat13> good thing paige is watching chat good on you paige
[0:44:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AIGHT NOW REMEMBER ALL THAT WHILE FIGHTING A DEVILJHO
[0:44:35] <+DandyChilla> Does Pat's dog have the Magnamalo layered armor? How'd you get it on PC?
[0:44:38] <Alzero83> Time to BONK
[0:44:42] <yourliteraldog> It looses it hammerness
[0:44:43] <%BinaryFireball> or is the stamina bar only half full???
[0:44:44] <GrahamBaxter> BIB BONK
[0:44:50] <%alphonseisbest> @BinaryFireball the grey one?
[0:44:55] <+OctaivianRex> @BinaryFireball Max Stamina. You gotta eat to increase it.
[0:44:59] <TehMud> And we haven't even gotten to wirebugs
[0:44:59] <Aussie_Manny> EEEEL KABONG! khadBonk
[0:45:00] <%zeroarturia> Hey Pat! Apparently there is a some sort of glitch with saving.  Please remember save often and tell Paige too.
[0:45:01] <%BinaryFireball> the redish one
[0:45:02] <%Kaask> it changes while moving and standing
[0:45:03] <%blastyoboots> you have to be going forward to do that
[0:45:03] <%BinaryFireball> ahhhh
[0:45:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Speeeeeeeeen
[0:45:04] <%BinaryFireball> thx
[0:45:07] <yourliteraldog> How do you sharpen a hammer?
[0:45:10] <+ikantreeed> uh huh
[0:45:12] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat You should change Paige's radical control to type 2, so she doesnt use items by accident
[0:45:17] <%alphonseisbest> @ssjklyco that a fucking Castlevania Dawn of sarrow ref?! o-o
[0:45:22] <stratrat13> ye rations and well done steak.
[0:45:25] <stratrat13> stamina
[0:45:29] <@ssjklyco> @ssjklyco I feel like a tool for not realizing that joke
[0:45:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @aussie_manny Bro.....only you and I got that reference LUL
[0:45:31] <%JenovasPuppet> You have to swing your hammer before you can swing your body
[0:45:42] <%rekinom> it's purple, @PatStaresAt
[0:45:43] <%mai_waifu_> Move & charge!! Hammer is so fucking awesome psaDogchamp
[0:45:45] <%MisterRockett> You get a different Level 3 if you stand still and let it go.
[0:45:46] <+Pachi3000> two types of modes
[0:45:53] <+patel347> tell her to look at the top
[0:45:55] <%cartakus> wr
[0:46:00] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> didn't know the starter hammer turned into an anchor
[0:46:00] <+patel347> at the color of the hammer
[0:46:01] <athuramn> why is she not starting with an easier weapon
[0:46:06] <+skm742> Hammer color under health and stamina. Blue is easier to leave in for beginners
[0:46:07] <Aussie_Manny> @BallerSwagBro9k LUL
[0:46:08] <%JenovasPuppet> Just go on a hunt, she'll learn by doing!
[0:46:09] <%TerpanderLux> hammer probably wasnt the best first weapon now that i think about it
[0:46:12] <LUvvUcy> Loving the dogs going ham in the back
[0:46:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mash and Swing Big Hammor
[0:46:16] <%cartakus> weapon information is the most important
[0:46:17] <+bytex678> this is why woolie hates monster hunter. too much to explain :D
[0:46:19] <Tatsabutt> @BinaryFireball so the way it works is that the stamina bar will have a filled yellow section, an unfilled orange section, and a white section. The orange section can be turned into the filled yellow section by consumables you bring into the field, giving you more max stamina, the white section can be extended by finding little buff orbs on missions
[0:46:20] <@goose_attack_almanac> @athuramn paige loves to smash.
[0:46:21] <+OctaivianRex> "Purple"
[0:46:23] <+niknikmcsneakerton> teach her charge blade real quick
[0:46:29] <+Pachi3000> you'll also maintain that mode until you press it again
[0:46:30] <DaKnightWarrior> Yellow isLight attack style and purple is Heavy attack style
[0:46:30] <%JenovasPuppet> Because hammer is BIG
[0:46:31] <tanarath> Blue/purple & White/yellow
[0:46:32] <yourliteraldog> give her the sword and shield
[0:46:34] <@Fuggins4U> they're like hammer bros!
[0:46:36] <%alphonseisbest> ^ YES LOL
[0:46:37] <wiDOPANos> Blurple
[0:46:37] <stratrat13> charged does better damage so just charge it and it stays charged til you put it away
[0:46:38] <%TerpanderLux> when youre learning how to play the game, no
[0:46:41] <+skm742> Blue level 3 moving is MUCH safer than yellow
[0:46:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> it doesn't matter until NG+3
[0:46:44] <%cooldude69xx> @TerpanderLux the other weapons arent much simpler
[0:46:45] <%cvp5127> should have gone with dual blades
[0:46:46] <%cartakus> Should have gone with SnS lol
[0:46:54] <+Pachi3000> wirebug
[0:46:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> remember, first rule of MonHun, don't get hit
[0:46:58] <thunderborn32> @TerpanderLux nah its a good choice, pats just being a bit involved; when she just needs to go hit thing
[0:46:59] <%charp35> I much prefer the blue
[0:47:00] <tanarath> It's like 1-handing vs. 2-handing in dark souls
[0:47:02] <+Roivas1991> So are they trying to learn various weapons that she'll like?
[0:47:05] <yukichocomilk> sns isn't any simpler
[0:47:14] <Tatsabutt> cartakus SNS is way complicated lmao, shoulda gone with like, LS
[0:47:16] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt is storing the hammer charge still a thing?
[0:47:20] <+bytex678> I've played MH since Tri, still haven't touched a sword+shield
[0:47:30] <%Nekros4442> guys....he really doesnt need backseating on teaching her how to play lol
[0:47:41] <@Fuggins4U> horsedog
[0:47:42] <+PrimalDweeb> 47 minutes in, and only now am I notified you're streaming...
[0:47:43] <Tatsabutt> bytex678 don't do it you will never play anything else again XD
[0:47:44] <+applegreen92> this is a fuckton better with gyro aim on L2 because you can flick the controller up and go as high up as possible really quick
[0:47:46] <LUvvUcy> As someone who went for heavy bowgun first time what was the easiest weapon for people who just starting?
[0:47:50] <+niknikmcsneakerton> hammer is a decent starter weapon I think
[0:47:53] <Aussie_Manny> doggy*
[0:48:08] <%Blank9> Easiest weapon to use is really subjective on what clicks to you
[0:48:09] <Flame_Water> i saw the bat signal
[0:48:09] <%cade_calrayn> she's riding Papyrus bbunsSis bbunsSis
[0:48:26] <Tatsabutt> LUvvUcy I'd say longsword, hammer, maybe the lbg. Maybe HH even, that's pretty simple now and really good
[0:48:27] <%Blank9> like lance is probably the easiest on actual inputs, but movement feels clunky
[0:48:27] <thunderborn32> dude, imagine if you could use the wire to pull yourself ONTO your dog
[0:48:28] <Aussie_Manny> SUPAIDA-MAN
[0:48:30] <+bytex678> she's going to forget everything the moment they start fighting a monster
[0:48:36] <%cartakus> I started with charge blade as a noob so...
[0:48:37] <%TheWinged7> gerrn?
[0:48:42] <+OctaivianRex> @LUvvUcy This, arguably or SNS.
[0:48:53] <LUvvUcy> 📝I see I see
[0:48:58] <Kalcom> isn't something like switch axe easier for mashing
[0:49:07] <+Pachi3000> Some take 1, some take 2, depends on the weapon
[0:49:09] <Tatsabutt> I dunno if I agree on SNS that weapon got way more complex since generations
[0:49:12] <Aussie_Manny> This is THE END
[0:49:14] <%TerpanderLux> impact crater my beloved
[0:49:19] <Tatsabutt> Kalcom in theory, but it will get you hit a lot
[0:49:19] <ToneBacas> RS

[0:49:32] <Ipsenscastle> oh no
[0:49:33] <+niknikmcsneakerton> @cartakus same I didn't know you could charge the shield through like a 3rd oh mhw
[0:49:39] <%ClericOfSparda> BLIND sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[0:49:40] <graemecrackers2> lol she blind
[0:49:46] <%BinaryFireball> man
[0:49:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> GLASSES HOLY SHIT LUL
[0:49:49] <%BinaryFireball> this control scheme
[0:49:51] <+patel347> you can change settings to make it auto
[0:49:52] <athuramn> literally the blind leading the blind
[0:49:54] <%cartakus> SnS has a learning curve but it still is a straight foward weapon
[0:49:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> :) i get my left and right confused sometimes
[0:50:04] <+bytex678> 20000 controls and they haven't even started fighting
[0:50:09] <+Pachi3000> agree, I actually prefer not to have lock-on in this game
[0:50:10] <+ikantreeed> this game is convoluted
[0:50:11] <%TerpanderLux> boy is it
[0:50:17] <Aussie_Manny> Monsters are VERY agile.
[0:50:19] <Mattais88> Now do it 14 different times
[0:50:24] <athuramn> this makes my dyslexia seem like a superpower
[0:50:27] <Abyssal_Jaguar> !PAIGE AT RISK!
[0:50:35] <+OctaivianRex> You play the game for 1000 hours and that's how you remember.
[0:50:36] <Megaleg> I knew she’d go hammer lol
[0:50:37] <Tracazoid> Swing and other swing
[0:50:40] <%OrangeMDT> Gosh, this is like tech support with my grandma
[0:50:46] <Ner234> UNGA BUNGA
[0:50:52] <%tank7013> And hammer is still the most simple weapon
[0:50:53] <yourliteraldog> unga then bunga
[0:50:53] <@Jekado> good ole mon hon where you just press the X X X and the Y Y Y and you get the suck.
[0:50:53] <%sendart> apply hammer to monster forehead
[0:50:55] <Tracazoid> Unga Bunga all over them Paige
[0:50:58] <Aussie_Manny> hit da face
[0:51:01] <+Pachi3000> Twin Blades is also good for beginners, IMO
[0:51:02] <stratrat13> is the sliding attack from world in this game?
[0:51:05] <%cartakus> Guve her the hunting horn lol
[0:51:07] <+mechslayer71> knew the second she chose hammer this was gonna happen
[0:51:08] <+scwry> longsword is probably the most beginner-friendly weapon
[0:51:08] <%Jhylla81> Please Hammer don't hurt em
[0:51:13] <+applegreen92> @PatStaresAt you can use the training settings to put the head down to the floor
[0:51:14] <+patel347> move the head lower pat
[0:51:15] <BinaryShuffle> Hunting Horn too
[0:51:20] <Ipsenscastle> Paige sounds completely unmedicated today, she's just frying up there
[0:51:21] <+OctaivianRex> Or Hunting Horn.
[0:51:21] <Aussie_Manny> khadBonk mama said knock you out
[0:51:22] <+bytex678> Paige will forget EVERYTHING in a few moments don't worry
[0:51:24] <%mai_waifu_> Hammer fucking tosses Monster's!
[0:51:25] <LucasTheDrgn> you can make the dummy bend forward in the menu
[0:51:26] <+Pachi3000> Twin Blades is literally just hit right trigger, mash attack buttons
[0:51:26] <Ner234> BOP
[0:51:26] <+ALazo> head privileges
[0:51:27] <Aussie_Manny> khadBonk i'm gonna knock you out
[0:51:28] <DaKnightWarrior> hard at first then soon It wlill become second nature.
[0:51:29] <%TubeMan642> Don't forget Hunting Horn
[0:51:29] <sheepymcsheeperton> bonk bonk on the head
[0:51:32] <%notsoy> BONK
[0:51:35] <Profmcstevie> Face privilege
[0:51:36] <+ikantreeed> if i choose hammer i get head????????
[0:51:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> which is where Paige likes to be, at the head
[0:51:39] <Tatsabutt> I would honestly say yeah the HH is like THE best starter weapon, it's simple, hits super hard and is just good
[0:51:40] <Treasure_Vault> Show her jump attacks off ledges if you haven't already, very important for hammer.
[0:51:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> you always get the head, out of courtesy
[0:51:44] <$chance_h> Brain damage is cool
[0:51:44] <stratrat13> dual blades and long sword great for beginners
[0:51:46] <+bravofifeniner> @OctaivianRex Hunting horn players always spend more time hitting other players
[0:51:54] <LongJohn> Crag shots get dibs on the entire monster
[0:51:58] <+Pachi3000> Yeah they don't
[0:52:03] <+bytex678> I remember when Pat talked woolie through this and woolie was haaaaaaaaating it
[0:52:06] <+OctaivianRex> @Treasure_Vault I think Paige is maxed on out brain already.
[0:52:08] <%mai_waifu_> I kept a Mizitsune down for over 20 seconds with Hammer
[0:52:15] <%TerpanderLux> a nice relaxing mission :)
[0:52:15] <%Jhylla81> I am Gato I have metal Joints Beat Me Up And earn 15 silver points
[0:52:16] <Abyssal_Jaguar> As someone who has ran many people through the start of this game, SnS is still probably best best starter weapon
[0:52:22] <%shurtal> "Take it easy" pat picks Negigante
[0:52:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[0:52:28] <+demon1103> Pat, she doesn't get rights to the head....she gets people yelling "just get flinch free" while they dual blade/ longsword the head
[0:52:30] <%cartakus> lol
[0:52:33] <Treasure_Vault> @Treasure_Vault Fair, each weapon takes a couple hundred hours until you can start to understand it
[0:52:33] <Tracazoid> LUL
[0:52:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LLUL
[0:52:34] <%Ne1son> Its not nice but it is true
[0:52:35] <@ssjklyco> I loved the original video.
[0:52:36] <Lynxystem> lmao
[0:52:36] <DaKnightWarrior> i remember lytKEK
[0:52:37] <+OctaivianRex> limesLUL
[0:52:39] <Profmcstevie> Woolie had Grandma-ed his settings
[0:52:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:52:41] <hakumaribo> Woolie was to interested in Fashion to the point his build was hot garbage.
[0:52:43] <%2DSuperiority> but the Lance looks cool tho
[0:52:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> It was a two parter!
[0:52:48] <%JenovasPuppet> To be fair, it is super easy to learn bad habits in this game.
[0:52:48] <LUvvUcy> lytKEK
[0:52:50] <@Spydurman> the video felt like fun ribbing of him and his menus while he was worried about showing monster fights
[0:52:50] <Explodincatz> Sad but True
[0:52:51] <%Kaask> its a shame, because if he kept playing, he could have eventually unlocked layered armor and weapons.
[0:52:54] <+bytex678> poor guy
[0:52:55] <%IamGrapes> that original video helped me figure out how to manage my bars lol
[0:52:57] <stratrat13> i actually learned alot about item bar sorting from that video
[0:53:03] <+ikantreeed> @hakumaribo he just like me
[0:53:04] <%TerpanderLux> eat up :)
[0:53:05] <ergulor> the dango?
[0:53:14] <@Spydurman> "THIS IS PLAYING THE GAME" is the best quote from that Woolie/Pat MH video
[0:53:18] <+Pachi3000> English voices DansGame
[0:53:19] <+DarkNerdShawny> tbh, pat isn't the best teacher, remember him teaching Woolie RE2...yikes lol
[0:53:22] <%Saadi90> Those videos were great! I learned a lot!

[0:53:56] <Darthkitten_Prime> Azuros is good
[0:53:58] <%JoshManVGH> I like the second video where they fight over whether or not Woolie should use the cool looking Lance.
[0:54:05] <LUvvUcy> Lagombi looks so cute in this artstyle
[0:54:05] <+Pachi3000> Ack! No sum.
[0:54:06] <@goose_attack_almanac> Remember. If Wyverians lay eggs that means they have a cloaca
[0:54:08] <@Jekado> FIGHT LUNASTRA!
[0:54:10] <+scwry> izuchi is good
[0:54:13] <UnImprest> gonna put her in the op starting gear??

[0:55:28] <+Pachi3000> NO, POINTS
[0:55:31] <+Pachi3000> NEVER USE MONEY
[0:55:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Did she already sell her golden eggs?
[0:55:40] <Tatsabutt> eat before basically every quest, unless it's just like, killing small monsters, gathering ingredients, or whatever
[0:55:43] <tanarath> LUL
[0:55:43] <+Pachi3000> save money for weapons and armor and items
[0:55:52] <Tatsabutt> Pachi3000 why points over money? Once you get HR caverns, money is literally infinite
[0:55:53] <LUvvUcy> catJAM
[0:55:54] <thunderborn32> funny kitty cutscene time
[0:55:55] <+Roivas1991> While Dango doesn't look as tasty as anything in World, it's vital to eat some before a quest.
[0:55:58] <Tatsabutt> you can farm a million zenny in half an hour
[0:55:58] <%TerpanderLux> fun :)
[0:56:00] <Mattais88> Low poly sheath?

[0:57:36] <stratrat13> @scrwy is her age specified or you just think that?
[0:57:40] <+Pachi3000> It can be overwhelming when you start

[0:57:48] <BedHome> this is the easiest one so far
[0:57:48] <Reisadan> "this is beary complicated" I c wut u did
[0:57:49] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Pat - If things don't work out with hammer, I genuinely suggest lance - Very simple but feels real big and strong as you shrug off hits
[0:57:52] <+applegreen92> english dub suuuucks
[0:57:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AND ITS JUST THE BEGINNING
[0:57:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> just wait till you hit NG+9 giga nightmare
[0:57:56] <+Pachi3000> unfortunately you don't get the monster intros in Hub Quests
[0:57:57] <+OctaivianRex> It's complicated because you do it over and over and over again.
[0:57:57] <ohno778> used to be even more complicated
[0:57:58] <DaKnightWarrior> Welcome to Monstper Hunter!

[0:59:43] <stratrat13> hold l2
[0:59:45] <%TerpanderLux> fast mode
[0:59:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> its like mario kart
[0:59:47] <+Roivas1991> I love the drift animations for Ammy and Rush.

[1:00:19] <+boki_86> @bytex678 how are 2 buttons complicated?
[1:00:21] <%Cynical2DD> Lion King Sora drifted for Monster Hunter Dogs could also drift
[1:00:21] <+Pachi3000> If you dismount while running, you'll do a leap off
[1:00:21] <@Jekado> its full of kraft mac and cheese!
[1:00:25] <EynoStiles> Still use two palico
[1:00:39] <%TerpanderLux> they have the lil star

[1:01:14] <+Pachi3000> he's not really....
[1:01:14] <yukichocomilk> it really is a lot LUL
[1:01:15] <Aussie_Manny> the controller difference
[1:01:15] <+FattimusSlime> @patstaresat If you keep throwing more things at her, she’ll forget how to breathe.
[1:01:16] <+Roivas1991> I love that both of these guys are using different controllers.
[1:01:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Like?
[1:01:17] <+ScottishMadJacko> paige, how do you not know what he means by circle?
[1:01:17] <Saltmeisterr> LUL
[1:01:17] <Bonebagmel> just throw her in, she'll figure it out
[1:01:18] <Tatsabutt> pat change your buttons to xbox buttons

[1:01:20] <+PrimalDweeb> I feel her pain! T_T
[1:01:20] <%TerpanderLux> VoteYea
[1:01:25] <%HarmonicArsenal> ironmouseMeltdown ironmouseMeltdown ironmouseMeltdown ironmouseMeltdown
[1:01:25] <%cartakus> Leave the items behind and go best on the monster for now
[1:01:28] <yeildingthought> LUL
[1:01:28] <%Dakuu75> No one is upset with you Paige. Take your time
[1:01:28] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:01:29] <%WizardPants1134> the patience
[1:01:36] <TheIncoherentGamer> we should have done 1 hr menu talk
[1:01:37] <ohno778> The average new player experience for monster hunter
[1:01:37] <%StephanieSadGirl> The sun is going doooooooooooown
[1:01:37] <+The_creepiest_man_in_chat> she should be using sns or duals. hard to mess those up Kappa
[1:01:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Can't cram 10 years of obfuscated gameplay systems into 1 hour Kappa
[1:01:38] <+Roivas1991> I also love that the Pro Controller isn't compatible with the PC version.
[1:01:41] <Aussie_Manny> brodayMeltdown you're going too faaaast
[1:01:43] <+Pachi3000> No, it's not the only one, she can access it from her start button too
[1:01:46] <mike2hands> mike2h1THUMBSUP  you can do it peach
[1:01:47] <+Pachi3000> But you want to have it this way
[1:01:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah this is not a Paige friendly game LUL
[1:01:49] <athuramn> @wizardpants1134 is truly unreal and immeasurable
[1:01:50] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt  dont forget theres an option to switch item menu to d=pad
[1:01:52] <DrkJP520> Shouldn't you teach her about the item wheel? The most convenient thing ever
[1:01:55] <%Kaask> its not that hard to internalize, but she also isnt like pat or many of us having played games all her life. she's doing fine.
[1:01:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh Boy. this is worth the price if admission
[1:01:57] <jmepik> there are only two ways, throw into deep end or be VERY SLOW
[1:01:57] <%TerpanderLux> Ya
[1:01:59] <$chance_h> Point her to a monster and let nature take its course
[1:02:06] <%TerpanderLux> PepoG
[1:02:06] <Reisadan> Say the name of it; First-Aid Med
[1:02:07] <%Nobrev> you can set it to cycle through with the d pad as well so you don't need to hold LB
[1:02:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm surprised she can't translate Playstation symbols to Xbox/Nintendo
[1:02:09] <AGuyNamedFrank> she'll likely want to use the radial menu
[1:02:10] <Saltmeisterr> @Roivas1991 That's hilarious
[1:02:12] <+applegreen92> Pro controller worked for me on steam, was automatically recognized on the demo
[1:02:12] <BigFingerRo> that doesn't sound convincing
[1:02:13] <$sleepystardewfarmer> it's just a really complicated system to explain
[1:02:16] <LucasTheDrgn> @Pachi3000 she can learn about that later
[1:02:26] <%zeroarturia> Probably might want to switch her controller with a PS5 one, so she won't be confused.
[1:02:28] <+bytex678> 100% paige will freak out when a monster appears :D
[1:02:30] <yourliteraldog> she baby
[1:02:31] <Radioactivetaco9> It took the devs years to figure out how to make a tutorial for MH. I dont blame pat for being a bit confusing
[1:02:33] <%cartakus> We all sink and swin with monster hunter
[1:02:34] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS !
[1:02:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt also let her know she cant keep them
[1:02:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LUL
[1:02:38] <Chaos_Aether> pagie is baby hunter
[1:02:39] <%JenovasPuppet> This is THE Monster Hunter experience!
[1:02:40] <@Jekado> There is a lot going on for one of the more recent games too
[1:02:44] <+OctaivianRex> Good idea Pat.
[1:02:48] <%oda_flobunaga> Much wow So Menu
[1:02:49] <Zombrocom> All he's done is tell her controls LUL
[1:02:50] <%watts121> enough with the menu stuff pat, take her to kill
[1:02:50] <+Pachi3000> THERE ya go lol
[1:02:51] <%cvp5127> smart
[1:02:53] <%StephanieSadGirl> Dog drifting was the straw that broke the paige's back
[1:02:59] <Alzero83> Calm yourself, Pat yovgStare
[1:02:59] <$scallycap> Paige is the best monster hunter
[1:03:02] <artoflec> it is the game that is stupid
[1:03:02] <+patel347> its fine paige, just hit the monster
[1:03:02] <+The_creepiest_man_in_chat> she needs to use Lance and guard poke the whole time 🤣
[1:03:04] <%KnightOfTrousers> Very front many load
[1:03:04] <Alzero83> take it slow
[1:03:04] <+ikantreeed> what?
[1:03:04] <Profmcstevie> Roll, attack, heal, sharpen. Go pattyBrain
[1:03:06] <tanarath> Paige, you're FINE
[1:03:06] <Tatsabutt> MH is insanely complicated, like... yeah, it's frontloaded as all hell
[1:03:06] <+scwry> its a hell of a lot
[1:03:07] <%TerpanderLux> youre not stupid its so damn much
[1:03:08] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah paige you're doing great
[1:03:08] <sheepymcsheeperton> I believe in you paige, everyone has trouble with this game starting out
[1:03:09] <@SSaryn> It's mechanically complex for sure.
[1:03:10] <+AWr00tBear> Chill
[1:03:11] <Aussie_Manny> who said that?
[1:03:11] <%hotcarl6872> You are not stupid, this is what everybody goes through
[1:03:11] <%Cynical2DD> No one is calling you stupid Paige
[1:03:12] <%cartakus> It's fineeeee
[1:03:13] <+ikantreeed> nah this game is convoluted as FUCK
[1:03:13] <LucasTheDrgn> Front Loaded is absolutely the way to describe it
[1:03:13] <Tracazoid> I bounced off World the first time I tried it, you're doing good Paige
[1:03:13] <yourliteraldog> this guy is super obtuse
[1:03:15] <+Pachi3000> MonHun is TOUGH, I was exactly where Paige is right now once
[1:03:15] <thunderborn32> nah, monster hunter is a heavy learning curve
[1:03:16] <%TubeMan642> No the game is just way to complicated
[1:03:16] <LUvvUcy> ??? Who's calling them stupid this games tutorial is MAD HARD??
[1:03:16] <%blastyoboots> NOBODY thinks you're stupid for not getting this don't worry, THIS SHIT IS WAY TOO COMPLICATED
[1:03:17] <MageValerie> no Paige this is complicated AF
[1:03:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Just pretend all the monsters are women
[1:03:20] <%JoshManVGH> People already being mean?
[1:03:20] <stratrat13> this is super complicated and intimidating for new players
[1:03:21] <Treasure_Vault> monster hunter takes a hundred hours until you stop sucking your own ass
[1:03:21] <+ikantreeed> like huh?
[1:03:22] <%JenovasPuppet> Monster Hunter is god damn ridiculous with how much it throws are you. But it's also hard to truly screw up.
[1:03:24] <+Pachi3000> this is friend
[1:03:25] <%TerpanderLux> a little bugoid
[1:03:26] <ohno778> wait who called her stupid find them

[1:03:28] <Aussie_Manny> Everyone has ankles of STEEL!
[1:03:28] <TetraBanshee> Now teach her about the meal system :)
[1:03:31] <@Ranryu692> If @PatStaresAt would just pronounce it "Cross" like it's supposed to be you wouldn't have this problem
[1:03:32] <%hotcarl6872> A lot of this is nonsense at first
[1:03:35] <%Bluwizard21> Paige PAt is trying to teach u like 5 hours of tutorial in an hour
[1:03:36] <%RustyCoyoteA> There is a lot in MonHun. You’re doing well Paige
[1:03:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> No one is calling you that. these games are hard
[1:03:40] <$Artoo__The_Me> I don’t think any monster Hunter fan will call a new player stupid
[1:03:41] <Reisadan> Bug juice tutorial
[1:03:43] <%TerpanderLux> he likes that
[1:03:43] <%KnightOfTrousers> You pop the bubble it's holding

[1:03:53] <artoflec> i think shit like these games is why nioh was not confusing to me
[1:03:56] <alroy909> yeah its a nice bug that you murder to preserve your vitality
[1:03:57] <+OctaivianRex> You steal its nectar.
[1:03:58] <+spacepiratezod> Monster Hunter isnt exactly: "I  can play without googling"
[1:04:00] <ArmadaGeddra> No joke I spent an hour re-learning Charge b;ade.
[1:04:00] <%oda_flobunaga> Imagine if they put Death Stranding's movement mechanics into this
[1:04:00] <tanarath> But healing goo, though!
[1:04:03] <%TerpanderLux> birdie :)
[1:04:03] <yourliteraldog> drain his goo

[1:04:28] <ohno778> @ForneusAtSeaWorld ew...
[1:04:31] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah people weren't outright SAYING she's stupid just a lot of "paige how do you not understand this" which is yeah just let her take her time learning.
[1:04:31] <LUvvUcy> I fear the player who first starts Monster Hunter and understands everything luvvucHamScared
[1:04:32] <Aussie_Manny> LUL
[1:04:32] <+ikantreeed> the 1st monster is menus lmaoooo

[1:04:38] <%TerpanderLux> im just picturing her batting away menus

[1:04:43] <Profmcstevie> The games getting in it's own way
[1:04:45] <%NitronStreams> it would surprize you guys how many people are unable to translate between ps buttons and xbox buttons on the fly
[1:04:45] <Aussie_Manny> Oohhhh, the tutorial menus.
[1:04:46] <%JoshManVGH> This game is so complicated that it greatly benefits from being in the same room with like a pointer stick.
[1:04:46] <%FacetiousAF> oh yeah you can totally just ignore some of these things
[1:04:49] <morow1ec> YOINK
[1:04:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOINK
[1:04:51] <Tatsabutt> bravofifeniner you can turn the display off for hud settings, so it only shows up if it's being "used"
[1:04:51] <chai_wolf> I had a hard time learning Monster Hunter stuff too and still forget shit all the time 🤣
[1:04:52] <Aussie_Manny> YOINK
[1:04:53] <+ikantreeed> Wouldn't that be ood training for her tho?
[1:04:54] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat And Woolie want to just jump into a hunt. like you have to know these info first
[1:04:58] <@SoFarFetched> @JoshManVGH but she's upstairs LUL
[1:04:58] <%TerpanderLux> a monkie
[1:04:58] <%JoshManVGH> Like it needs a 101 level course.
[1:04:58] <yourliteraldog> LeTS ThRaSH
[1:05:00] <%KnightOfTrousers> Paige beat DS3, I have faith in her
[1:05:02] <$sleepystardewfarmer> she looks like she's physically fighting the menus
[1:05:04] <DaKnightWarrior> Poor Wroggi LUL
[1:05:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> All-Terrain Pupper
[1:05:18] <+healnavi> should have started Paige on MH1 to ease her in Kappa
[1:05:27] <+Pachi3000> deres da bear
[1:05:28] <+Jack8274> But a gatherer palico doubles you output from hunts... so no doggo for me

[1:05:41] <+GrassCannon> gtf back here
[1:05:42] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Vital question: can you make your character shut up, I'd get real tired of my character's lines while playing
[1:05:42] <Profmcstevie> Honey Badger Bear
[1:05:43] <+PrimalDweeb> Kill the bear!
[1:05:43] <yourliteraldog> shinnies
[1:05:43] <dont_call_me_steve> if you manage to get Paige fully hooked on Rise we're in for a new era of A+content
[1:05:44] <+OctaivianRex> Alright go fight the bear Paige.
[1:05:44] <Tracazoid> LUL "I don't want any of this"- Bear

[1:05:50] <SulfurousAcid> not winnie the pooh! D:
[1:05:51] <Tatsabutt> Jack8274 gatherer palicos are greed as hell and I do the same thing
[1:05:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> badgear
[1:05:55] <+bytex678> she's gonna be so confused when they start fighting
[1:05:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> who said bear?
[1:05:58] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Paige isn't stupid, but it is winter right now, and the sun goes down around 4:35 pm around this time of year Kappa
[1:05:59] <%GinAndRoses> he saw Paige and said I don't want none of that smoke
[1:06:06] <BigFingerRo> And this isn't even the most obtuse one, Peach, they used to be MUCH more complicated
[1:06:07] <+OctaivianRex> The bear was also scared of the menus. That's why he ran.
[1:06:08] <%JoshManVGH> @sofarfetched Oh I know, but like Capcom should send someone with the game.
[1:06:09] <Reanimator83> Paige sounds like she's in pain half the time LUL
[1:06:09] <essence_of_lariatto> @SaphronBlackbourne you can turn them off in options
[1:06:10] <%NitronStreams> LET THEM FIGHT
[1:06:14] <BepBepAmShep> @SaphronBlackbourne Yes.  It's in the options.
[1:06:18] <DaKnightWarrior> time to ride
[1:06:32] <LUvvUcy> Seeing my friends ride the monster first time was SO COOL
[1:06:35] <%JoshManVGH> "So you've bought Monster Hunter. Lesson 1!"
[1:06:35] <ozzrabbit> Ah yes, Arzuros, the BLOODLUST INCARNATE!
[1:06:39] <+Pachi3000> now whack
[1:06:40] <+scwry> she might have it on darksouls by default
[1:06:47] <+The_creepiest_man_in_chat> should've launched into other thing lol
[1:06:49] <Latija> oh ya baby hammer time
[1:06:55] <%StephanieSadGirl> Thats just a fuckin' bear!
[1:07:03] <@SoFarFetched> Its okay paige just take your time processing whats going on.

[1:07:17] <+ScottishMadJacko> man, feel kinda bad for paige, doesn't sound like she's having fun
[1:07:19] <athuramn> could you imagine if she chose the charge blade as her first weapon

[1:07:24] <+Jack8274> Just don't get hit, easy LUL
[1:07:26] <%NitronStreams> press button do big damage
[1:07:26] <%Dakuu75> personally, I swapped the item bar scrolling from square/circle to the left/right D-pad. it's so awkward otherwise
[1:07:31] <stratrat13> maybe db or ls would be better for her to learn?
[1:07:35] <$sleepystardewfarmer> I think learning this system just takes time more than anything
[1:07:35] <captwolfaroo> The nuances of mashing will come in time
[1:07:40] <Tatsabutt> yeh take some time to just process and get used to the controls a little more 'cuz it's a ton
[1:07:43] <+The_creepiest_man_in_chat> one day paige will be able to solo apex arzuros 😎
[1:07:45] <+OctaivianRex> The game won't hurt you AS bad as early Dark Souls so it fine if you take hits.
[1:07:48] <Latija> citation needed
[1:07:59] <AMajorTom> There should be whole separate programs, like Mavis Beacon teaches MonHun
[1:08:00] <+healnavi> A lot of Dark Souls is just Monster Hunter and Zelda
[1:08:03] <Zombrocom> And this is the fastest drinking in any monster hunter game
[1:08:03] <LUvvUcy> sdksjhfsdg I forgot the bear tries to SHOULDER CHECK
[1:08:03] <+Pachi3000> The thing that takes forever to learn in MonHun is how much weight and purpose your moves have
[1:08:09] <@Fuggins4U> they doin it
[1:08:11] <+DrBunni> isnt that just a giant honeybadger
[1:08:13] <+Pachi3000> Like when you press your button you wanna be sure you're doing it at the right time

[1:09:25] <%cade_calrayn> Paige craves the Bloodborne
[1:09:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> this is great

[1:09:39] <+healnavi> Is Monster Hunter the Dark Sould of Dark Souls?
[1:09:43] <Lagzlot> A monster's health bar is how many of their limbs are still functioning.
[1:09:48] <+Pachi3000> are you saying Gief is pathetic as fuck
[1:09:51] <+PrimalDweeb> When he's tired, abuse him!

[1:10:07] <%FacetiousAF> doggie on d-pad right and then down?
[1:10:10] <@goose_attack_almanac> What if Paige tried the Great Lance? She gets big spear and she can use the big shield if she wants. Like when she fought Gwyn.
[1:10:12] <%cartakus> Soon Paige will be ready for fatalis
[1:10:13] <+Pachi3000> You can sharpen while riding

[1:12:44] <LUvvUcy> Boobabadger never stood a chance
[1:12:46] <%cartakus> why you so mean to bear?

[1:13:55] <+Pachi3000> It's a good idea to ride dog if you need to sharpen in the middle of combat, since you can move while sharpening there
[1:14:04] <EynoStiles> Head, aim for the head. like thanos
[1:14:04] <%TerpanderLux> 😡
[1:14:11] <%Agami23> he's gone bearzerk

[1:15:02] <@Moobot> @gatdragon I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 15m.
[1:15:05] <+Pachi3000> also pick up items in the environments
[1:15:07] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[1:15:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> just beat ass
[1:15:12] <%JoshManVGH> No, to make hats!
[1:15:13] <Ner234> "harmless"
[1:15:14] <%oda_flobunaga> Weabooitcher
[1:15:15] <%FacetiousAF> HARMLESS
[1:15:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> If Pat's Wofl is Gief, what is the name of Paige's Dog?
[1:15:17] <+GrassCannon> that bear is not harmless
[1:15:17] <%cartakus> Pest control also
[1:15:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> find the ass and beat it
[1:15:18] <LucasTheDrgn> "harmless"
[1:15:20] <%Dakuu75> "harmless" lmao
[1:15:24] <Aussie_Manny> They are not harmless.
[1:15:26] <%GinAndRoses> beat them up and wear their skin
[1:15:27] <yourliteraldog> but also yes
[1:15:28] <BigFingerRo> do they fuck very strongly, pat?
[1:15:29] <+Jack8274> But 95% are just chilling, you kill them for parts
[1:15:30] <whittacre> Nobody would buy the game if it was called "Fantasy Big Game Hunter"
[1:15:30] <Profmcstevie> it STARTS at bears :)
[1:15:32] <%FacetiousAF> hes the introduction.
[1:15:32] <@ssjklyco> They go from Harmless to HarmMore
[1:15:35] <+Pachi3000> go up waterfall
[1:15:37] <+Pachi3000> no you don't
[1:15:39] <+Pachi3000> You can walk through there
[1:15:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt they're all invasive species and are typically killing people on trading routes or something before you get sent out
[1:15:42] <Aussie_Manny> Like, isn't the lore reason that they're terrorising places?
[1:15:43] <%TerpanderLux> a bear shortcut
[1:15:43] <%TubeMan642> Like Kezhu the lightning testicle monster
[1:15:44] <captwolfaroo> The most harm possible
[1:15:44] <+OctaivianRex> This is like the Monster Hunter equivalent to a Rattata.
[1:15:46] <BinaryShuffle> We'll see how "harmless" she finds Gigginox
[1:15:47] <+Pachi3000> Peach was literally on it
[1:15:48] <Ner234> Bear EXCLUSIVE
[1:15:48] <+FattimusSlime> Paige’s dog is Pupyrus
[1:15:50] <sheepymcsheeperton> you can just go up the water stream
[1:15:51] <%BlueLunecy> Just walk up the walls Pat
[1:15:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> did he teach her the map yet?
[1:15:54] <EDFscout> just go through the waterfall EZ
[1:15:55] <LucasTheDrgn> all the quest descriptions imply that the monsters are actually upsetting the ecosystem
[1:15:56] <%Valdorick> A bear necessity.
[1:15:56] <%tank7013> Also like 90% of the monsters WILL completely destroy the ecosystem if their numbers aren't controlled through hunting
[1:15:57] <toomanygnome> can't you climb the waterfall?
[1:15:57] <Profmcstevie> Bear super highway
[1:15:57] <EynoStiles> Nargacua is gone be fun
[1:15:58] <+Pachi3000> that's correct
[1:16:02] <whimwhisp> Oh come on
[1:16:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ecology Hunter
[1:16:04] <+scwry> Kappa
[1:16:05] <+rafaelba93> sure
[1:16:07] <whimwhisp> this is bullshit like 90% of the time
[1:16:09] <@commanderclaw> Park Ranger Patrick
[1:16:11] <Profmcstevie> invasive or troublesome for the locals
[1:16:11] <whimwhisp> they're just looking for ecuses
[1:16:11] <+ikantreeed> sure
[1:16:12] <Ner234> "Good guy"
[1:16:14] <%oda_flobunaga> Weabooitcher Rise: Wild hunts
[1:16:16] <%hairtoday> preservation like taxidermy
[1:16:16] <sold515> preserve with big hammer
[1:16:17] <%tank7013> Some of them singlehandedly
[1:16:19] <+OctaivianRex> That's what the hunters say anyway...
[1:16:20] <ozzrabbit> It’s still funny that the bear is “Bloodlust Incarnate”
[1:16:20] <+DizzyGunner> we only club seals when the seals are breeding too much
[1:16:21] <ohno778> Nice excuse
[1:16:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Not according to Monster Hunter Stories, which says you're crazy
[1:16:22] <Aussie_Manny> Well, I feel better about killing them now. smile :)
[1:16:22] <%Monkeyweed21> the Ecosystem demands you make a fancy new hat
[1:16:23] <huskarl_zap> because Capcom are pussies
[1:16:25] <%Deft_Thought> Conservationist*
[1:16:26] <whimwhisp> they thought old spikey boy was an invasive species and you find out at the end of the game he's super important XD
[1:16:27] <%Agami23> i like how the hunters in stories are dickheads
[1:16:27] <yourliteraldog> Gotta sell the there horns to wealthy aristocrats to make there dicks hard
[1:16:29] <tanarath> You murder for good
[1:16:29] <Profmcstevie> "Hey this fucking Rathalos took my sheep! Kill it!"
[1:16:30] <%greasypete00> isnt world about finding new lands and just killing everything there
[1:16:32] <%TerpanderLux> hungurry...
[1:16:34] <usuallysleepy> they are also infinite population of them so
[1:16:36] <AMajorTom> Man, the planet sure is lucky to have us around.
[1:16:37] <Oscarthemowerman> 95% of all species in monster hunter are invasive don't think about it :)
[1:16:39] <+geeceevee45> Aren't most of the areas near the villages and not in the deep wildserness?
[1:16:40] <+ikantreeed> and pokemon is not dog fighting it's...educational
[1:16:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt Also most of the time you get sent to kill a specific member of the species that has been attacking people or something
[1:16:41] <%zarkazeon> zarkazeon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Paige your doing great! yes the worst part of monhon is the menus, and I started my MH journey with the chargeblade.
[1:16:44] <ohno778> EZ
[1:16:44] <EynoStiles> In game you only ever fight monster once
[1:16:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> it's an excuse to justify the Beaver Genocide
[1:16:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> We got Androids 17 and and 18 here, Ranging the shit outta these parks
[1:16:50] <+demon1103> Yeah...we are just here to...preserve nature. Now kill that animal in front of it's children!!!!
[1:16:51] <%Jhylla81> You don't normally see Deer hunters crafting sick armor out of their spoils
[1:16:55] <%cartakus> And if hunters don't behave the guild will send assassins to break their legs
[1:16:55] <LUvvUcy> A hard days work of beating up random animals fadelEATIN
[1:17:06] <thunderborn32> youre not you when your hungry
[1:17:10] <ohno778> KILL THE ANIMALS
[1:17:10] <%JenovasPuppet> They Hun any Mons yet?
[1:17:11] <EynoStiles> @cartakus Yep
[1:17:16] <+Pachi3000> he always hangs out by the honey
[1:17:18] <dlocke1991> Sharpen your hunger
[1:17:28] <LUvvUcy> Omg he went to get some honey jmikeSadbungle
[1:17:29] <%GinAndRoses> meat is like a whetstone for your human
[1:17:30] <+geeceevee45> hunger is like human sharpness? I understand hunger now
[1:17:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> im a conservationist :)
[1:17:37] <+polothegreatest> woolieF woolieVS woolieCHAN
[1:17:39] <Aussie_Manny> For the ecosystem! 2020Forward
[1:17:39] <EynoStiles> we hunt monsters, we dont poach.
[1:17:41] <%cartakus> Stop bully!
[1:17:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "The money i paid will keep OTHER Lions alive!" Some Dentist Kappa
[1:17:42] <yourliteraldog> Can't wait till yoko taro is allowed to direct the next monster hunter, we get destroy life as we know it
[1:17:48] <+leviting> going into Demon Mode to save the ecosystem
[1:17:50] <+OctaivianRex> Pat really digging into this bear.
[1:17:53] <Chaos_Aether> no bully
[1:17:54] <+Jack8274> Careful pat, she might fall in love. It worked for you
[1:17:55] <LUvvUcy> I forgot how bad it feels to beat up these monsters when starting out lmao
[1:18:00] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeah yeah yeah big hammer swings!
[1:18:01] <MelonSouda> @geeceevee45 Surely sleep is human sharpness?
[1:18:03] <BigFingerRo> "pathetic piece of shit" MAULING paige
[1:18:06] <%tank7013> There are canonically some monster species where a single one of them alone can literally destroy an entire ecosystem by themselves
[1:18:16] <Aussie_Manny> By your powers combined... I AM CAPTAIN PLANET! doodGood
[1:18:17] <+UltraViolet371> hey, does Rise do the thing that World did where the quest will scale to two hunters' worth of health?
[1:18:19] <+PrimalDweeb> It's not for sport goddam it! I already told you! It's to protect the Eco-System!
[1:18:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> ambulate while you imbibe
[1:18:31] <+bytex678> Bear was just wandering around eating food then these two a-holes comes and beats him up out of nowhere
[1:18:33] <EynoStiles> GG
[1:18:35] <+tinytinykittycat> just dont drive
[1:18:36] <athuramn> @ultraviolet371 yes
[1:18:36] <BigFingerRo> no ds walking drink here
[1:18:37] <sold515> plant barrels filled with heavy explosives next to the sleeping animal to save the forest
[1:18:38] <Profmcstevie> Elder Dragons are defined in part by their "can influence their entire ecosystem" ability
[1:18:41] <thunderborn32> sprinting makes you drink faster
[1:18:46] <+scwry> smashing a monster in the face with a "super amped elemental discharge" for the good of the environment
[1:18:49] <LUvvUcy> The widdle bombadgers omg luvvucBashfur
[1:18:53] <+Jack8274> It is super useful
[1:18:54] <+UltraViolet371> @athuramn oh cool, ty!
[1:18:59] <+Pachi3000> they telegraph big moves
[1:19:00] <+Jack8274> It also lets you know when Aggro changes
[1:19:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> bear v fish
[1:19:13] <yourliteraldog> We protect the ecosytsem for sport
[1:19:14] <+OctaivianRex> Anti-aired
[1:19:20] <cherryburnout> paige is doing doing really good job
[1:19:21] <Lagzlot> There should be sliders for character voice frequency if you get tired of wolves hunting in packs.
[1:19:23] <+Roivas1991> Yeah, your hunter saying be careful is actually real useful.
[1:19:26] <%JenovasPuppet> Nice totally intentional hammer to sword combo there.
[1:19:29] <+Pachi3000> oof
[1:19:35] <+bytex678> Not buying the eco crap, bear was just living his best life until these bastards came around to beat him up D:
[1:19:35] <LUvvUcy> @cherryburnout They are! luvvucMidNya
[1:19:40] <@Fuggins4U> I love that, as a couple, they're gettin rekt 2gether. <3
[1:19:44] <%superc37> inb4 she forgets all of this by the next time she plys the game lol
[1:19:44] <+Pachi3000> BUTT SLAM
[1:19:45] <Profmcstevie> There are sliders to make hunters silent, thank god
[1:19:47] <+patel347> we need gamba for who carts first
[1:19:56] <JojoPiero> @Lagzlot There is. Less a slider and more a setting, 100, 80, 50, and 30 iirc
[1:20:01] <+Pachi3000> But you hit a lot more times, Paty
[1:20:02] <+OctaivianRex> When monsters are at low health they tend to be very dangerous.
[1:20:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> she got da big hamber
[1:20:05] <+bytex678> Now they will beat him up 10 more times to get some ass feathers or whatever to make a weapon
[1:20:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> mirin hammer
[1:20:07] <PanicSwytch> Is Paige enjoying the Hammer?
[1:20:10] <ohno778> BIG PAIGE BIG DAMAGE
[1:20:11] <+Pachi3000> he's not done, wail on him!
[1:20:11] <DaKnightWarrior> @fuggins4u LUL
[1:20:12] <JojoPiero> and 0, obvs
[1:20:14] <+DizzyGunner> dual blades always seem to do dick for damage
[1:20:15] <+skm742> Blue mode hammer would help Paige a ton. Level 3 charge doesn't lock you into a spin move for 5 seconds.
[1:20:17] <+Roivas1991> Also, if there were more people, the monster would have been tougher.
[1:20:17] <+ArsCaelia> VIOLENCE
[1:20:19] <dont_call_me_steve> did Pat play this on switch? or is this his first time in
[1:20:20] <%cartakus> fuck
[1:20:22] <Aussie_Manny> REKT
[1:20:25] <+NobuuNobuu> the bear was stealing all the honey he deserves death
[1:20:28] <%hairtoday> spin2win
[1:20:32] <%Kaask> gotta teach her about the golf swing, so she doesn't spin herself dizzy every time.
[1:20:35] <+GrassCannon> Pat is HR 5
[1:20:35] <+Roivas1991> They scale difficulty by multiplayer.
[1:20:36] <@Fuggins4U> Pat, your wahmina and health-uh are low
[1:20:37] <%SolumFuturae> spin to win unfortunately not as good as souls games
[1:20:37] <%cartakus> He played on release
[1:20:38] <@Ranryu692> @dont_call_me_steve he played a bit on switch, and he's had the game for a few weeks
[1:20:38] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is Paige aware of Knockout damage for hammers
[1:20:50] <+PrimalDweeb> I mean, bears will eat people alive; they don't have the courtesy to kill you first. So fuck em.
[1:20:52] <+scwry> may be helpful for paige to learn about moving attacks vs standstill attacks
[1:20:59] <Aussie_Manny> Smack his butt!
[1:21:07] <dont_call_me_steve> ahh sweet, thank you ranryu
[1:21:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> if Pat gets carted...
[1:21:11] <+skm742> Spin is great, just need to actually know when to use it. Blue hammer doesn't punish you for much
[1:21:11] <TetraBanshee> Bad news for pat(?): it sounds like peach isn't a big fan of bears
[1:21:12] <athuramn> @queequegtheater that's like 2 hunts away in terms of complexity
[1:21:12] <LUvvUcy> Did Pat teach the most important skill of all? How to pet your dog?
[1:21:15] <+DizzyGunner> isn't azeros more of a giant honey badger?
[1:21:19] <EynoStiles> @queequegtheater She is, but right this is training lol
[1:21:36] <+OctaivianRex> Paige during your spin attack you can hit Y near the end to do a BIG HIT.
[1:21:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt good rule of thumb for Paige that I've always used is to always be above 50% HP
[1:21:45] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Yeah, She needs to learn either blue switch or golfswing out of spin, or she's gonna have a rought time
[1:21:51] <slix3431> Pat's char is so pissed
[1:21:53] <Tomschiii> man, the more i read about rise, the less i want to play it :/
[1:21:54] <+bytex678> might aswell just send her to youtube and watch 20 different "weapon guide" videos then
[1:21:57] <Profmcstevie> Body part damage, ease of stagger, limping, all ways to determine health
[1:21:57] <ohno778> look at that doo doo water
[1:21:57] <yourliteraldog> Only polar bears eat people alive but honestly they deserve climate change their diet is mostly babies
[1:22:00] <%oda_flobunaga> It would be easier to see if there were Doom Eternal levels of monster fuckedness
[1:22:03] <+scwry> she can also stand still and she wont do the spin
[1:22:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @DizzyGunner I thought that more describes Zinogre
[1:22:10] <Mattais88> Might want to find the base camp while your here
[1:22:12] <+DizzyGunner> most important thing with the hammer is hit the head
[1:22:14] <dont_call_me_steve> @tomschiii how come? too fast?
[1:22:23] <+Pachi3000> EATIN HONEY
[1:22:23] <Latija> are the busted hammer slide attacks from world in rise?
[1:22:26] <LUvvUcy> You're both doing super! Keep it up! <3
[1:22:28] <+Pachi3000> you missed him eatin i
[1:22:28] <%OrangeMDT> @yourliteraldog LUL LUL
[1:22:31] <thebalticguy1> if you don't purposely kill the spin you get stunned for 2 seconds
[1:22:39] <%cartakus> Komodo dragon would be fucked in monster hunter
[1:22:42] <+bytex678> Not buying the eco crap, bear was just living his best life until these bastards came around to beat him up D: Now they will beat him up 10 more times to get ass feathers for a costume
[1:22:44] <+Roivas1991> Thanks World for making it Western based.
[1:22:45] <$scallycap> it used to be WAY WORSE
[1:22:47] <Tatsabutt> It got popular because it's fun as heck
[1:22:47] <+GrassCannon> This is Monster Hunter being nice
[1:22:49] <yourliteraldog> Polar bears are evil
[1:22:52] <@Fuggins4U> I eventually got good, and i'm bad at everything! fugginDab fugginDab
[1:22:52] <+Roivas1991> So Rise can be Japanese.
[1:22:59] <Tatsabutt> it's literally all cool boss fights
[1:23:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> man FU sucked lol
[1:23:04] <dont_call_me_steve> @latija even better, one of the wirebug moves for it is literally just that attack
[1:23:04] <ohno778> Popularity of souls game allowed this to happen
[1:23:06] <+OctaivianRex> @Latija Yes. Also as a Wire Bug Zttack.
[1:23:07] <Tomschiii> @dont_call_me_steve its no world, yes, but its horribly easy, the reward for apex isnt there, meaning content is kinda worthless etc
[1:23:08] <Aussie_Manny> i seens it
[1:23:10] <+bytex678> Monster Hunter is a game for bullies
[1:23:13] <BinaryShuffle> "Agressively Japanese" is how I described the JP VA for the monster intros LUL
[1:23:16] <TigerClaws12> yeet
[1:23:18] <%FacetiousAF> @Fuggins4U you're great at being fuggins though and i know there's dozens of us who appreciate that
[1:23:19] <Aussie_Manny> KAIOKEN doodCrazy
[1:23:19] <Latija> :O
[1:23:19] <Profmcstevie> MH1 sold over a million on the PS2, it's a series where people persevere through the jank
[1:23:20] <yukichocomilk> it's a lot at the start, but it's such a consistent gameplay loop that you just get it
[1:23:24] <thunderborn32> pat gotta get that flinch free
[1:23:27] <+DizzyGunner> pat says that but old MH players compained it's far too easy and beginer friendly LYL
[1:23:31] <@Fuggins4U> @Fuggins4U aw yay
[1:23:38] <LUvvUcy> luvvucHamScared
[1:23:40] <dont_call_me_steve> @tomschiii ahh yep, that's my hope for Sunbreak - actual Apex armor sets and weapons
[1:23:45] <@Fuggins4U> i love dual blades
[1:23:54] <Ner234> Three SHARED lives
[1:24:00] <EynoStiles> per hunt
[1:24:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> is SnS still trash in Rise?
[1:24:15] <+OctaivianRex> @thunderborn32 Flinch Free actually dosen't stop you from getting launched IIRC.
[1:24:19] <dont_call_me_steve> NO
[1:24:20] <sheepymcsheeperton> it was never trash
[1:24:24] <Profmcstevie> I believe the in game reasoning is the cat rescue takes a cut of your paycheck every cart till there's no more money to be made LUL
[1:24:26] <+scwry> SnS was never trash
[1:24:26] <thunderborn32> at rank 3 it does
[1:24:27] <dont_call_me_steve> SnS FUCKS
[1:24:28] <%cartakus> SnS is good
[1:24:30] <+applegreen92> SnS has some of the highest damage output and a counter
[1:24:30] <Tatsabutt> legendfather_of_giants what the hell are you talking about the sns hasn't been trash since 4
[1:24:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Ner234 This
[1:24:33] <+applegreen92> 2 counters actually
[1:24:34] <DrkJP520> I was banging my head against an apex arzuros earlier today
[1:24:37] <Weberkraut> Golf Swing and the Charge 2 both aren't affected even by rank 3 Flinch Free
[1:24:40] <EynoStiles> @legendfather_of_giants SNS is the shit here man
[1:24:41] <Aussie_Manny> What if Peach dies 3 times? Does Pat get to keep going?
[1:24:43] <Tomschiii> @dont_call_me_steve feels like a thrown in filler game as everyone waits for the main dish, and i dont the bugs but thats me
[1:24:44] <+Pachi3000> "1 more"
[1:24:48] <%hotcarl6872> SnS has always been good in Rise
[1:24:51] <Tomschiii> like*
[1:24:55] <%OrangeMDT> May need to get the group heal item out
[1:24:55] <@Fuggins4U> Bear Shortcut is a great drag king name

[1:25:03] <%baka_sugoi> ONLYBEARS
[1:25:04] <+geeceevee45> They did SnS dirty by giving it to beginners for so many games, they all think it is trash

[1:25:29] <Treasure_Vault> @Fuggins4U Cut Shortbear
[1:25:33] <+OctaivianRex> There's a bear here. It's gone now.
[1:25:34] <arkv01> damn the PSP5 looking good
[1:25:40] <LUvvUcy> Legit seeing you two play this together makes me wanna get my partner to try, this looks so cute to play together <3
[1:25:42] <sheepymcsheeperton> @Dakuu75 yes
[1:25:42] <dont_call_me_steve> @geeceevee45 yeah when I played world it took me until iceborne to try it out, ended up using it for all of IB
[1:25:44] <Abyssal_Jaguar> @Dakuu75 yes
[1:25:50] <Tatsabutt> Dakuu75 yes you can, but I think most of the sets only unlock towards the end of high rank
[1:25:57] <%fanciful_fright> fanciful_fright subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Almost forgot y'all were playing Rise today. A little sad to see that Paige is using the lesser cousin of Hunting Horn, but at least weeb swords are flashy. (Love ya guys, keep up the great work)
[1:25:59] <%RustyCoyoteA> Something something using promo for Honey as bears
[1:26:00] <@Fuggins4U> i had to step away a few times, has either of them mounted the bear yet?
[1:26:06] <+applegreen92> this hunt takes most people like 5 minutes what is even happening
[1:26:17] <Chaos_Aether> pat did
[1:26:18] <Tatsabutt> Fuggins4U pat did early on yeh
[1:26:20] <+Pachi3000> okay there we go
[1:26:20] <%Dakuu75> doodShake thanks chat~
[1:26:21] <dont_call_me_steve> I believe Pat rode the bear towards the start
[1:26:21] <+Pachi3000> almost there
[1:26:22] <LUvvUcy> @Fuggins4U Pat did at the beginning but no more since then
[1:26:23] <Reanimator83> @fuggins4u pat has
[1:26:23] <+GrassCannon> NOW he's close
[1:26:25] <Abyssal_Jaguar> CAPTUREABLE
[1:26:26] <Tomschiii> are there more abilities aside from the main 2 wirebug moves? feel a little stale after some time
[1:26:27] <Veluren> @applegreen92 He picked it as their first one in fresh gear
[1:26:27] <@Fuggins4U> nice, thx
[1:26:27] <%cartakus> More like hunting horn is the weird cousin
[1:26:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Fuggins4U I think i remeber these events happening
[1:26:28] <Profmcstevie> Arzuros throwing it back
[1:26:31] <dont_call_me_steve> jerpChill jerpChill jerpChill
[1:26:36] <%Criotos> @Fuggins4U Yeah, around the start of the hunt
[1:26:38] <%TerpanderLux> great! :)
[1:26:38] <+OctaivianRex> @applegreen92 There both using basic weapons and Paige is new.
[1:26:39] <%MooseIsGoose> Be sure to let her know these monsters are meant to have like 4 on 1 so if she thinks it's taking awhile to kill that is why.
[1:26:42] <+Pachi3000> When this happens, it means you can capture them
[1:26:56] <dont_call_me_steve> @tomschiii yee every weapon has 3 moves that can be switched out, one always being a wirebug move
[1:27:06] <%TerpanderLux> dont worry about that yet
[1:27:09] <%Agami23> i somehow never saw that symbol
[1:27:11] <+applegreen92> Peach is fine, pat is shitting the bed
[1:27:14] <%greasypete00> music in this game rocks
[1:27:17] <+ALazo> you can actually capture them before that shows up
[1:27:24] <+ALazo> your cat points out they are weak first
[1:27:24] <Tatsabutt> not entirely actually, the thresholds are slightly different but, yeah
[1:27:24] <LUvvUcy> Get he ass luvvucQuieres
[1:27:30] <tanarath> Murder it to restore health to the ecosystem!
[1:27:32] <Alzero83> the Humane thing to do is Catpure tho
[1:27:35] <Alzero83> Kappa
[1:27:41] <%cartakus> I can't wait for monhun 6 in like 3 to 4 years
[1:27:45] <TacoSaIad> public domain Winnie the Pooh be like

[1:27:53] <+GrassCannon> is he gonna get a chance to limp away?
[1:27:57] <slix3431> This is totally a battle couple
[1:28:00] <SQDizzy> any greatsword mains?
[1:28:04] <+bytex678> damn these fights last forever
[1:28:05] <%hotcarl6872> You must kill him.  For nature.
[1:28:14] <%TerpanderLux> get his ass
[1:28:15] <+OctaivianRex> @MooseIsGoose Monsters in hub actually do have health scaling for less players. It's just the basic weapons and newness are why it's taking so long.
[1:28:17] <%nichos7> nichos7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[1:28:18] <HarshNerf> complete noob here,what are the flashing symbols near the names?
[1:28:20] <+applegreen92> maining weapons in MonHun is that weak shit
[1:28:22] <Ghufufin> get em Pat use y our Naruto skills! Believe it!
[1:28:23] <Tatsabutt> bytex678 that's what starter gear + multiplayer health will do
[1:28:24] <%cartakus> Stop abusing him verbaly
[1:28:25] <+bytex678> with 2 players monster get like double health?
[1:28:28] <+Pachi3000> You'll also notice at this stage sometimes their attacks have less efficiency
[1:28:34] <+Pachi3000> he's probably gonna go sleep now
[1:28:41] <Profmcstevie> no don't hurt me
[1:28:44] <usuallysleepy> having tier 1 starter weapons with even the best player will stake long guys
[1:28:47] <Aussie_Manny> He's very slowly getting away!
[1:28:47] <+Pachi3000> at this point when they run they usually go to sleep
[1:28:50] <+applegreen92> @bytex678 there's health scaling on monsters yes
[1:28:51] <+GrassCannon> healbug in the back
[1:28:58] <Aussie_Manny> He's heading for the old mill!
[1:28:58] <yourliteraldog> Is it humane you know some prick is gonna keep it in tiger king esq zoo
[1:29:00] <@ssjklyco> I'm just picturing the hunter yelling "Stop running! We're trying to preserve you"
[1:29:00] <Tatsabutt> bytex678 afaik there's only two scalings, one for solo, one for multiplayer, so he's probably got more than double hp since it's made for 4 people
[1:29:03] <%MooseIsGoose> @MooseIsGoose I did not know that. I thought it was always set to be based on 4 hunters. Thank you for clearing it up
[1:29:06] <Tomschiii> played the gl for pretty much ever but here i just dont feel like its fun, cant point at the reason why
[1:29:06] <+Pachi3000> temporary
[1:29:08] <@Fuggins4U> temporarily
[1:29:10] <Ner234> @bytex678 Also they are using VERY basic weapons.
[1:29:10] <+OctaivianRex> I would recommend Pat use upgraded weapons to speed up the next hunt.
[1:29:18] <PanicSwytch> Any Gunlancers in chat?
[1:29:20] <yourliteraldog> Tigrex King A netflix series
[1:29:24] <+OctaivianRex> Not fully upgraded but just a bit.
[1:29:25] <+applegreen92> @MooseIsGoose that's pre World scaling
[1:29:30] <dont_call_me_steve> gunlance is so good in Rise
[1:29:30] <+Pachi3000> a little bit
[1:29:35] <yourliteraldog> No only glaive
[1:29:43] <+Pachi3000> sleepy boy
[1:29:51] <+OctaivianRex> @Tatsabutt That's how it used to be. They fixed it.
[1:29:51] <Profmcstevie> Sleep heals HP
[1:29:53] <+scwry> FOR THE ECOLOGY
[1:29:55] <+Pachi3000> this is how you handle sleepy bois
[1:29:55] <dont_call_me_steve> that counter that sharpens the weapon, and can be followed up be either a full burst or a fast wyrmstake is fucking divine
[1:29:56] <Kiiper> thats wrong they do heal
[1:29:56] <+PrimalDweeb> Yeah! Fuck em up!

[1:30:34] <+scwry> she's got the swing down too
[1:30:34] <%cartakus> I love gun lance but I don't understand why it needs a shield. It would be so much better two handed with more mobility

[1:31:01] <whimwhisp> that's part of the monster hunter experiance~

[1:31:11] <DaKnightWarrior> You won't feel bad when the strong monsters roll up.
[1:31:11] <tanarath> Don't worry! They aren't sentient!
[1:31:12] <Profmcstevie> Don't worry Paige, some of them are building sized dragons :)
[1:31:13] <%colezone_> alot monsters take a huge ass-beating

[1:31:18] <Mattais88> That's our Hney damnit
[1:31:18] <+HaloIsA> is the moral justification for hunting animals in monhun bc theyre invasive
[1:31:19] <Reanimator83> Did pat show Paige how to slide down hills?
[1:31:19] <Aussie_Manny> is it evil though?
[1:31:21] <dlocke1991> Did you see it eating fish? It's a monster!

[1:31:30] <LUvvUcy> Don't worry Paige you're doing great!
[1:31:30] <+geeceevee45> You need to protecc the cat people from monsters
[1:31:31] <%1Rayson> 1Rayson subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! hey woah, it's been 27 months already? Hey is the PC version of Rise worth it?
[1:31:31] <%tank7013> He's also naturally an asshole unironically
[1:31:32] <tcosmiclatte> trust us paige, if the roles were reversed, monsters would show no mercy
[1:31:39] <%cartakus> @dekkitout but better
[1:31:39] <Ner234> No NOT nice
[1:31:45] <Razeino> Bears are cannibals that eat there  young. Don't feel to sorry.
[1:31:52] <+applegreen92> @Pachi3000 your weapon hit counts ontop of the explosion
[1:31:55] <DaKnightWarrior> cart 1
[1:31:58] <Aussie_Manny> f
[1:32:01] <dont_call_me_steve> @tomschiii I wouldn't say that, but the fact that they gave it such a good counter makes up for a lot of it's shortcomings
[1:32:07] <DrkJP520> Just me, or do more people than previous games not give a crap if a monster falls asleep? They'll just keep swinging
[1:32:17] <slix3431> Look at pat's dumbass ninja headbang
[1:32:19] <+OctaivianRex> If there's more First Aids in the blue box grab them.
[1:32:19] <+patel347> restock on poitions
[1:32:21] <ohno778> Why didnt you save your wife Pat?
[1:32:21] <+Pachi3000> @applegreen92 Ah, sure, I'm just thinking, if you'd rather not be caught in the explosion
[1:32:22] <+ikantreeed> he was right behind lol
[1:32:22] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat They added more hitlag noise to weapons in pc version
[1:32:25] <@ssjklyco> Sex times
[1:32:28] <LUvvUcy> I really appreciate how nice the death replies are in this game "Dont sweat it" "Its okay"
[1:32:32] <Alzero83> shes doing good, chat, shut up
[1:32:33] <@Fuggins4U> Carts happen to everyone, especially at the beginning
[1:32:42] <+patel347> default loadout
[1:32:44] <yourliteraldog> Hot Box that tent
[1:32:49] <+patel347> has potions on it
[1:32:53] <+bytex678> oh god this menu is a mess
[1:32:53] <+GrassCannon> Death replies don't hit the same when the game forces you to do them imo
[1:32:55] <PanicSwytch> Also carting doesn't affect the materials u gain. It only lowers the amount of money u earn for that mission
[1:32:58] <%JenovasPuppet> MenuHunter
[1:33:07] <+applegreen92> @Pachi3000 das no fun. At least get a slightly smaller/bigger barrel and slamdunk it from the air
[1:33:11] <+OctaivianRex> @LUvvUcy I changed mine to a Darkest Dungeon quote: "A setback, but not the end of things."
[1:33:12] <+bytex678> I think paige just went into eyeroll mode
[1:33:19] <Tomschiii> @dont_call_me_steve hmm, understandable, for many complained, but there is already the lance. anyway, as long as my evasion doesnt get "nerfed"
[1:33:23] <+ikantreeed> that was a nice animation
[1:33:25] <Mattais88> I never use barrels. I should really start
[1:33:29] <Alzero83> we can talk item loadouts later
[1:33:30] <LUvvUcy> @LUvvUcy Yaaaaasss Darkest Dungeon lets go
[1:33:38] <+PrimalDweeb> Eat a meal?
[1:33:41] <%ClericOfSparda> I love my lance, my long sword, and my hammer
[1:33:45] <+Pachi3000> TBF he's probably like just a minute or two of hits away from death at this point
[1:33:48] <+bytex678> please don't tell her about the loadouts yet
[1:33:51] <Profmcstevie> Long Sword? You're a multiplayer monster
[1:33:53] <@ssjklyco> Gotta sharp your whets
[1:33:56] <essence_of_lariatto> Barrels aren't as good now cause you can go all out with wirebugs

[1:34:24] <@ssjklyco> There's a joke in "Let's go finish off that bear"
[1:34:25] <dont_call_me_steve> @tomschiii I'd recommend looking up what Evade Extender 3 looks like in this game, gunlance double backhops can cover dual blade distances
[1:34:28] <%FacetiousAF> ms. paige the timer is running low
[1:34:31] <+SodiumPatrol> @SilverFaustX poggers
[1:34:31] <DrkJP520> i thought weapons sharpen automatically when you enter a tent
[1:34:44] <TacoSaIad> At this point you could eat again at the tent tho
[1:34:47] <LUvvUcy> Ooh I didn't know the buffs left

[1:40:05] <%averyoddjew> just got here, what weapon is paige using?
[1:40:06] <+OctaivianRex> @chidoriphoenix Pretty sure it's just him and Paige for now.
[1:40:13] <thunderborn32> @ChrisPlaysThing check out youtuber chef pk, he just made a vid on ramen 'cheats' theres a really interesting peanut butter sauce to change things up
[1:40:14] <dont_call_me_steve> hammer baby

[1:42:05] <Profmcstevie> Just follow the lines Paige, you'll be fine~
[1:42:06] <Tomschiii> i must say, even tho i dont care that much about graphics, world kinda "ruined" me with glamoring my character^^
[1:42:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is way too much for her
[1:42:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why is she even trying lol
[1:42:15] <+GrassCannon> @tank7013 why would you play a girl if you didn't want to be pretty? Kappa
[1:42:20] <Parapattern> This is why people bounce off of Monster Hunter
[1:42:26] <%TerpanderLux> surely, you have one
[1:42:32] <Ner234> Wait doesn't Rise have glamour options?
[1:42:48] <+bytex678> cos you didn't tell her about farming items yet
[1:42:50] <dont_call_me_steve> it do ye, better than world actually
[1:42:52] <+OctaivianRex> @Ner234 It does. You get it later.
[1:42:53] <%Hamborgini> glamour unlocks later
[1:42:53] <+ArsCaelia> @Ner234 yeah, way at endgame tho
[1:42:56] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> it does
[1:42:57] <%Criotos> @Ner234 it does but they unlock a lot later
[1:43:02] <Ner234> Oh

[1:43:21] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Grab some Subquests!
[1:43:21] <dont_call_me_steve> and it was in the game at launch, and didn't take like a year to be added to the game
[1:43:30] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Easy time to learn about subquests!

[1:50:09] <+Roivas1991> Imagine Pat introducing Paige to a previous MH.
[1:50:13] <Ner234> That's normal
[1:50:17] <BinaryShuffle> PERFECT
[1:50:18] <%BlueLunecy> That's normal
[1:50:18] <%cartakus> Nice
[1:50:18] <%TerpanderLux> its ok if you bounce off the first time
[1:50:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think she's in
[1:50:19] <tranquilturnip> LUL
[1:50:20] <$yeknomlive> youll know in 100 hours
[1:50:22] <Ner234> PERFECTLY normal
[1:50:22] <itt_technical_institute> that's me everytime I play lol
[1:50:22] <dont_call_me_steve> hah, that's pretty normal yeah
[1:50:23] <thunderborn32> yep, its a slow burn
[1:50:23] <+GrassCannon> THAT'S Monster Hunter!
[1:50:24] <@ssjklyco> It takes 200 hours to decide that
[1:50:24] <%KnifeyMcEdge> LUL'
[1:50:24] <MageValerie> understandable
[1:50:25] <%blastyoboots> NORMAL
[1:50:25] <gingemahminge1> Just perfection.
[1:50:25] <Pookiedaexzile> She's Starting to Believe
[1:50:25] <yourliteraldog> thats monster hunter
[1:50:26] <wifishine> She's in
[1:50:27] <DaKnightWarrior> Welcome :)
[1:50:27] <Tracazoid> Such is the Monster Hunter life
[1:50:30] <%MooseIsGoose> The decider is when you play with your friends.
[1:50:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> she's in
[1:50:31] <%cade_calrayn> It's something you'll want to play with Pat
[1:50:36] <ZweihanderSteve> SeemsGood
[1:50:37] <%KnifeyMcEdge> mmmmm tasty gun
[1:50:39] <yukichocomilk> that's normal? I liked it instantly
[1:50:41] <+skm742> It only gets easier from here at least
[1:50:48] <%Hamborgini> took me like a year of off-and-on play to figure out that I liked it actually
[1:50:49] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> normal
[1:50:50] <dont_call_me_steve> a bowgun perhaps?
[1:51:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fuck that then lol
[1:51:04] <%Blank9> and then when it clicks you go "oh I smash dinosaur head haha"
[1:51:06] <%Cynical2DD> I have 26 hours in and I strill dont know
[1:51:08] <+PrimalDweeb> You need time to process it, so sleep on it and try again.
[1:51:14] <+Wolfstriker121> is light bow gun fun to use?
[1:51:23] <%cartakus> Here you go child go hunt for meat, or starve
[1:51:23] <@goose_attack_almanac> Monster Hunter Rise is a lot more arcadey. You get in and fight monsters way sooner. But theres still all the gathering shit to do.
[1:51:26] <dont_call_me_steve> it helps if you have someone to play it with
[1:51:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Those are the right emotions
[1:51:36] <@ssjklyco> If you are feeling that, you're going to like monster hunter
[1:51:36] <yukichocomilk> this is so weird to me LUL i did one fight and loved it
[1:51:38] <%GinAndRoses> the monster hunter experience
[1:51:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Sherpa hunter
[1:51:41] <dont_call_me_steve> @wolfstriker121 hell yeah
[1:51:42] <%TerpanderLux> this game still pisses me off like nothing else on this earth and i have like 900 hours in world
[1:51:44] <%FacetiousAF> $5 says she likes the combat and needs to adjust to "minutia"
[1:51:46] <whimwhisp> I learned on my own!
[1:51:46] <+Pachi3000> Yeah my brother taught me how to play this
[1:51:48] <whimwhisp> well
[1:51:48] <Profmcstevie> My friend was.....myself
[1:51:49] <T_Sasquatch> i hated monster hunter world every time i played the betas, the only reason i bought it was because everyone was gushing about the game and i felt like i was wrong because the game looked cool
[1:51:49] <Latija> i learned by myself
[1:51:51] <whimwhisp> with a friend who was also new
[1:51:52] <%SolumFuturae> Pat taught me how to play :)
[1:51:53] <Mattais88> Once you find a really good monster to fight, you'll know
[1:51:55] <%CopperTucker> I put 30 hours into Rise and decided that I just didn't really like it. I love Stories tho
[1:51:55] <EynoStiles> It use to be so much worst
[1:51:55] <%Sotetsu> When I tried Monster Hunter, I thought "This is 25% hunting monsters and 75% bullshit"
[1:52:00] <+OctaivianRex> That or you can be a masochist.
[1:52:00] <$yeknomlive> lmao
[1:52:04] <%cartakus> monhun world was a lil bit better with all the tutorials
[1:52:06] <Tracazoid> LUL
[1:52:09] <TheRealNumberJ42> everything is so streamlined in this game don't let paige ever play an older monhun lol
[1:52:09] <Ner234> Pat wtf LUL
[1:52:10] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[1:52:11] <DaKnightWarrior> LOL
[1:52:12] <+PrimalDweeb> Agreed, that; or try and learn through YouTube tutorials.
[1:52:18] <+Wolfstriker121> pat taught us all how to play monster hunter
[1:52:19] <%MooseIsGoose> There are a lot of things stop people from getting into this. I had to throw myself into MH to get into it and now it is one of my favorite things.
[1:52:20] <%RustyCoyoteA> I didn’t like MonHun the first time I played it… then it all clicked
[1:52:21] <Profmcstevie> That's a TERRIBLE gift
[1:52:31] <%RustyCoyoteA> Yes
[1:52:31] <%tank7013> That's pretty much the reason why so many people compare monster hunter to dark souls
[1:52:31] <AllenDeadman> yeah...
[1:52:34] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Pretty much
[1:52:35] <@ssjklyco> It has both better and worst controls than Dark Souls
[1:52:35] <Dumple_Roe> kinda
[1:52:36] <%genocidal_cupcake> yeah
[1:52:36] <%strakillias> No
[1:52:36] <%TerpanderLux> hi :)
[1:52:36] <+ikantreeed> same voice
[1:52:37] <%tank7013> That feeling
[1:52:37] <+UltraViolet371> no that was accurate
[1:52:37] <+PrimalDweeb> Eh...
[1:52:38] <whimwhisp> Ehn
[1:52:39] <+GrassCannon> never played DS, but sounds right
[1:52:40] <%RustyCoyoteA> That’s 100% true
[1:52:41] <Ipsenscastle> uncanny
[1:52:42] <$yeknomlive> kinda
[1:52:42] <whimwhisp> sortof?
[1:52:43] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Darksouls but just bosses
[1:52:43] <+OctaivianRex> Kinda?
[1:52:44] <%cartakus> Jesus
[1:52:44] <%CopperTucker> yeah
[1:52:46] <$Trenr> I can see it
[1:52:49] <dont_call_me_steve> yeah it's like the good part of DS over and over
[1:52:50] <+ArsCaelia> maybe
[1:52:51] <T_Sasquatch> Also you have to find your fac weapon in monster hunter before you even like it
[1:52:53] <%Blank9> it's all dark souls bosses
[1:52:54] <dont_call_me_steve> shits great
[1:52:58] <+ALazo> get dark souls, but throw away everything but the bosses and give movesets a modicum of complexity
[1:52:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Sorta?
[1:53:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> some of sihns animations are from Rath
[1:53:08] <TyKun04> Yeah kinda
[1:53:17] <Megaleg> Yeah there are some dark souls fights that feel like monster hunter
[1:53:22] <+FattimusSlime> Monster Hunter is Baby’s First Dark Souls until g-rank
[1:53:26] <+imthewisejanitor> As someone who has no idea, I can confidently say, yes.
[1:53:36] <%TerpanderLux> now you know everything there is :)
[1:53:39] <Sternieliscious> Kinda like what if Cuphead didn't bother with the platforming.
[1:53:39] <+PrimalDweeb> Mechanically speaking, this feels slower than Dark Souls.
[1:53:50] <%cartakus> Just the weapon play was enough to keep me going, everything else was just absorved
[1:53:53] <T_Sasquatch> monster hunter world was my first mmo Kappa
[1:53:54] <thunderborn32> birb fight
[1:53:58] <$sleepystardewfarmer> Cheer500 Pat, are there any weapons that are like embarrassing to see people using? I just started, and it's a little silly but I'm nervous about joining any co op with a weapon that's like "The Baby Weapon" or something
[1:54:07] <dont_call_me_steve> the wirebug is such a fun mechanic, hope she latches onto it
[1:54:15] <TheRealNumberJ42> this game is not slower than dark souls lol wirebug is dmc crazy
[1:54:18] <EDFscout> also:G U N
[1:54:19] <Profmcstevie> Dark Souls has been speeding up over the years
[1:54:20] <%BestTeaMaker> @sleepystardewfarmer nope
[1:54:21] <yukichocomilk> @sleepystardewfarmer nah they're all good
[1:54:26] <%BestTeaMaker> any and all weapons are good
[1:54:27] <topiodonk> monhun hooked me with Rathian on Tri, I think I farmed 10 of them for some stupid drop and i was having fun the whole time
[1:54:27] <thunderborn32> mon hun is a different game for every weapon
[1:54:28] <%Blank9> insect glaive is an entirely different weapon
[1:54:30] <%TerpanderLux> @sleepystardewfarmer no nobody cares what you use
[1:54:31] <$yeknomlive> i love wirebug so much more than the slinger and clutch claw
[1:54:32] <cherryburnout> @sleepystardewfarmer No
[1:54:34] <%vaporousTippler> I honestly want a Dragoon action game that plays like insect glaive.
[1:54:35] <%cartakus> @sleepystardewfarmer all weapons have a learning curve and are valid
[1:54:35] <+OctaivianRex> Enemies have slower swings but bigger hitboxes in general.
[1:54:36] <%Blank9> or I guess, different game
[1:54:37] <%dekkitout> Unless you're one o those bow using speedruning human freaks
[1:54:37] <%Valdorick> Insect Glaive, Insect Glaive, copter around in my Insect Glaive.
[1:54:37] <$Trenr> all weapons are good
[1:54:39] <Profmcstevie> There ARE no baby weapons in Monhun
[1:54:40] <dont_call_me_steve> @sleepystardewfarmer people are shitty about bowguns sometimes, but that's about it
[1:54:43] <rasamune> @sleepystardewfarmer no. but if you pick Long Sword just be mindful of your teammates
[1:54:47] <%CopperTucker> yeah, when learning I frequently said "I just want it to be Bloodborne"
[1:54:54] <%RustyCoyoteA> @sleepystardewfarmer every weapon is good and viable
[1:54:54] <Byronic_dreamer> I hope Paige gets filtered by Khezu
[1:54:57] <%tank7013> @sleepystardewfarmer People tend to get salty towards longsword users because they trip other hunters easily if you're worried about that kind of thing
[1:55:00] <$sleepystardewfarmer> aw thanks everyone
[1:55:01] <%Treuan> Cheer500 My group just successfully progged 1st circle. I know it's not much but I'm proud of my performance as DRK
[1:55:01] <$Trenr> clarifying statement: all weapons are good, some are just gooder than others
[1:55:02] <T_Sasquatch> you guys are liars , people absolutely hate on weapons in this game LUL
[1:55:04] <%Cynical2DD> Monster Hunter 3DS was my first, didnt get any where near far in it, tried Rise Demo, didnt get into it, World was when I finally started to like it
[1:55:04] <fairore> im charge blade main
[1:55:04] <Ralfclogs> @sleepystardewfarmer if people bully you for your weapon choice they’re bad people
[1:55:05] <+PrimalDweeb> Primalweeb... T_T LUL
[1:55:06] <yourliteraldog> eat your candy
[1:55:07] <topiodonk> nomnoms
[1:55:12] <%Blank9> bloodborne weapon's just switch axe and charge blade
[1:55:14] <%TerpanderLux> pick balls
[1:55:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> You can eat at camp too, if you need to
[1:55:14] <Reanimator83> Paige, what are you getting angry at. Interested in what you aren't liking
[1:55:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> or forget

[1:55:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> roast beast
[1:55:46] <%Cynical2DD> eat the mold Paige
[1:55:47] <%tank7013> It's also an easy way to mass produce herbal meds
[1:55:48] <+Stormzcales_Lair> pay w/ points
[1:55:50] <+geeceevee45> you can also just cook meat that way instead of in quest
[1:55:51] <%oda_flobunaga> Don't worry about it till NG+
[1:56:03] <dont_call_me_steve> motley mix popfishes for gourmet fish for one of the best healing items in the game fun fact
[1:56:05] <%tank7013> Well... easier. It's already pretty easy
[1:56:21] <%YakumoYomi> @oda_flobunaga Ooooh you~

[1:56:46] <%Bailey__Gaming> Which Weapon did Peach start with?
[1:56:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> The Polisher is my favorite anti-hero

[2:02:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> and show him
[2:02:55] <+scwry> A tip that may help is to treat it like a turn based game, wait for the monster to finish its attack and then move in

[2:06:20] <otakon17> GET'EM!
[2:06:21] <simplyvince15> Is Paige rolling after her attacks?
[2:06:24] <EDFscout> lmao "runs away"
[2:06:26] <%tank7013> @T_Sasquatch Ninty might still have console exclusivity
[2:06:28] <badluckwarlock> great izuchi is a worthy jobber
[2:06:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> 😡 i can't believe pat is playing sub optimally rn smdh
[2:06:30] <otakon17> Goddammit I wish I had this
[2:06:37] <%epide> horny tail sent to jail iwth a bonk
[2:06:37] <otakon17> Sharpness is NOT NEEDED FOR HAMMER
[2:06:41] <DaKnightWarrior> Paige seems to be having fun :)
[2:06:44] <+Pachi3000> meanwhile Pat got dat blue sharpness
[2:06:47] <otakon17> Charged hammer CANNOT deflect
[2:06:50] <%epide> sent to jail
[2:06:51] <%Bailey__Gaming> Hammers need to be sharp?
[2:06:52] <%RustyCoyoteA> Good. That means you were hitting real good
[2:07:02] <%blastyoboots> The shiny things got knocked off the monster when you broke its parts
[2:07:04] <+scwry> @otakon17 it does less damage though
[2:07:04] <@PlagueOfGripes> I miss palamutes auto-seeking the target
[2:07:12] <+DizzyGunner> otakon17 it definatly is, lower sharpness = less damage
[2:07:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> You should still stay sharp, foir the multiplyer
[2:07:17] <T_Sasquatch> @tank7013 maybe theres hope , it will be ported later .... yup....
[2:07:18] <+SimplyRandy> low sharpness still lowers your damage
[2:07:24] <otakon17> yeah but for hammer it doesn't matter that much
[2:07:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 20% is 20%
[2:07:41] <+scwry> its a huge reduction to your damage still
[2:07:42] <otakon17> plus there's a skill that gives you the opposite as you lose sharpness
[2:07:43] <+scwry> it matters
[2:07:47] <otakon17> that's affinity
[2:07:49] <+SimplyRandy> you always want maz sharpness
[2:07:57] <+DizzyGunner> otakon17 no it does, if you have less than green sharpness you do way less damage
[2:07:57] <otakon17> no you don't
[2:07:59] <Ner234> Not really
[2:08:01] <otakon17> not with Hammer
[2:08:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> affinity is crit chance
[2:08:03] <BinaryShuffle> not really
[2:08:07] <T_Sasquatch> not if youre good LUL
[2:08:10] <kazadog> yeah not at al
[2:08:11] <BinaryShuffle> maybe in the 3 monster hunts
[2:08:12] <sussy_baka_999> Nope LUL
[2:08:13] <+Pachi3000> also hunts where you do more than one monster in one go
[2:08:14] <%hotcarl6872> Maybe the first time
[2:08:15] <dont_call_me_steve> that's like fatalis in world
[2:08:19] <+OctaivianRex> Only Fatalis and u only get 30.
[2:08:20] <DaKnightWarrior> depends on the player.
[2:08:22] <%D00msDayDan> the only time i hit the time limit during a quest was the one in World where you fight every elder dragon back to back
[2:08:22] <%oda_flobunaga> Yaizmat?
[2:08:23] <%cartakus> I hate this ds shit
[2:08:26] <Profmcstevie> If you're on G Rank stuff? lower DPS weapons can push 40
[2:08:27] <+AWr00tBear> Explore the map for fun!
[2:08:28] <TheRealNumberJ42> in the older games sure in world and this? naw
[2:08:29] <jmepik> well, not in rise
[2:08:29] <%DeadStage> try to teach Paige how to switch to charge mode: strength, it's a lot better
[2:08:30] <+DizzyGunner> people who don't know shit chatting like they know everything LUL
[2:08:36] <kazadog> fatalis you only get 30 and people still rarely time out
[2:08:39] <+Pachi3000> I mean of course he is, Pat's using an upgraded weapon
[2:08:43] <+SimplyRandy> @otakon17 look up sharpness damage multipliers
[2:08:51] <%Bailey__Gaming> Are there flashpods n traps Inn this one?
[2:08:52] <dont_call_me_steve> yeah she'd love the blue level 3 charge
[2:08:52] <+Pachi3000> seen
[2:08:53] <Ner234> @DizzyGunner ???
[2:09:04] <thunderborn32> ahhh, good old head in ground
[2:09:10] <%BestTeaMaker> @Bailey__Gaming yes
[2:09:15] <%Nekros4442> HAmmer still needs to maintain sharpness or they'll start bumping off when they hit stray monster parts when aiming for head
[2:09:18] <%doomunderthestairs> is Peach doing the ungabunga?
[2:09:28] <+scwry> unless youre running bludgeoner, you should always keep your weapon sharp
[2:09:39] <BinaryShuffle> She's doing it! she's monster hunting!
[2:09:40] <SulfurousAcid> unga help you bunga
[2:09:42] <+scwry> theres damage multipliers that matter a ton
[2:09:44] <+DizzyGunner> @Ner234 just people in chat throwing out false info then when like 12 people correct them they still act like they know
[2:09:46] <%TerpanderLux> ewwww
[2:09:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> good job Hammer!
[2:09:49] <Profmcstevie> Seens it
[2:09:50] <sold515> @kazadog really? during the first few weeks the timer was the biggest problem for me and any randoms i tried with
[2:09:54] <kazadog> even then bludgeoner isnt that great for offsetting the damage loss
[2:09:57] <@Ranryu692> a greatsword is just an ungabunga with edge
[2:10:01] <%doomunderthestairs> HAZAH sipsipDab
[2:10:09] <dont_call_me_steve> yeah sharpening is always good
[2:10:10] <+scwry> yeah bludgeoner kinda sucks
[2:10:22] <%GinAndRoses> hey izuch you're a BITCH
[2:10:23] <kazadog> @sold515 maybe im just too used to current fatalis hunts
[2:10:25] <%blastyoboots> Shiny things were knocked off the monster Paige
[2:10:27] <%JenovasPuppet> But weapon good... must hold weapon
[2:10:32] <+DizzyGunner> greatsword is just hammer for cutting tails
[2:10:32] <Profmcstevie> Hands are full with your BIG MEATY HAMMER
[2:10:36] <%Deft_Thought> I kinda miss the slinger
[2:10:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> really want to unlock water strike
[2:10:44] <+PrimalDweeb> She's getting into it!
[2:10:49] <+OctaivianRex> Paige can finally give in to the ADD
[2:10:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> mining used to SUCK
[2:10:54] <@ssjklyco> The dog doesn't mine it
[2:10:54] <%cartakus> Plague!
[2:10:56] <DerpioParty> This is how you mine for dogecoin one could say
[2:10:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> slaving away in the dog mines
[2:10:59] <%TerpanderLux> water strike is awesome
[2:11:01] <%Bailey__Gaming> DogMine
[2:11:02] <%GinAndRoses> mine your dog
[2:11:07] <%hotcarl6872> Sharpness matters for Hammer too, it matters for every melee weapon.  There might be some moves that don't bounce but not every move
[2:11:10] <kazadog> @legendfather_of_giants limited pickaxes *shudder*
[2:11:12] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Broken picaxes >.<
[2:11:13] <%DeadStage> I struggled to use Water Strike on Switch so much. Haven't tried it on PC yet.
[2:11:18] <+mechslayer71> had to leave for a bit, how's Paige doing?
[2:11:18] <T_Sasquatch> its existence sucks ass in general
[2:11:19] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[2:11:19] <%GinAndRoses> the dark times
[2:11:24] <AsterisTV> And you had to buy them manually, they weren't infinite in older games
[2:11:24] <DaKnightWarrior> Old World days LUL
[2:11:25] <Profmcstevie> Mining did not use to suck ass, the pickaxe breaking sucked ass
[2:11:27] <BlairCombustion> omg this game at above 30 looks so good
[2:11:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I still have freedom unite somewhere
[2:11:29] <LucasTheDrgn> Plus crafting better pickaxes to get better ores
[2:11:29] <DaKnightWarrior> good times
[2:11:30] <otakon17> yeah unless you drop from YELLOW to RED you don't ahve to worry about sharpening a hammer that much
[2:11:34] <+DizzyGunner> and you would have to get 1 use fish to sharpen LUL
[2:11:35] <+scwry> sharpness isnt even about bouncing, its the damage multipliers
[2:11:36] <dont_call_me_steve> so happy that GU made the cats not need picks and nets
[2:11:38] <+geeceevee45> Leather armor gathering sets FeelsGoodMan
[2:11:42] <TheRealNumberJ42> back in my day we had to carry 4 pickaxes both ways up the mountain
[2:11:42] <%tank7013> THAT is one thing I never want back. I don't mind having to hit it more than once so much but the breaking suuuuucked
[2:11:51] <otakon17> someone tell Pat that you get different rewards when you trap or kill
[2:11:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I bring it out to cripple my friends hands when they say controls can't ever be that bad
[2:11:53] <+PrimalDweeb> Trap that bitch!
[2:11:55] <Ner234> ??? just place it under him
[2:12:00] <+Pachi3000> you also could have just put it on top of him
[2:12:00] <LucasTheDrgn> Trapping gives different material drop rates from slaying
[2:12:00] <otakon17> >doesn't put the trap right under the sleeping dino
[2:12:04] <%Nekros4442> @otakon17 He knows...
[2:12:07] <+Pachi3000> why didn't you just put it on top of him LUL
[2:12:08] <sussy_baka_999> LUL ??? why tho
[2:12:11] <+GrassCannon> good night!
[2:12:12] <%Bailey__Gaming> DRUGS
[2:12:14] <+demonsamura> whats wrong with fighting the last phase?
[2:12:14] <Marhunter7> At least your not having to attack with the right stick! ... still don't know how i managed to beat fatalis with that control scheme.
[2:12:17] <%TerpanderLux> 🤓 PLAY IT LIKE ME
[2:12:17] <%GinAndRoses> sleepy
[2:12:18] <+Pachi3000> ah ok
[2:12:20] <DaKnightWarrior> EAT UP
[2:12:20] <+mechslayer71> you can tranq while they sleep tho
[2:12:21] <Sternieliscious> Teaching moment.
[2:12:22] <+SimplyRandy> he is demonstratinv
[2:12:23] <otakon17> Ah I'm sorry, my bad
[2:12:26] <$SophiaAmoreaVeritas> "Peach liked you."
[2:12:26] <%Nekros4442> @otakon17 You arent giving him new info dude just let him go as his pace to teach
[2:12:28] <thunderborn32> awww peach likes you pat
[2:12:32] <+Pachi3000> this is true
[2:12:37] <otakon17> I didn't realize he was teaching Paige
[2:12:38] <Hydrapissed> idk if thats true in rise
[2:12:40] <%DeadStage> Some materials can only be gained from carving however
[2:12:42] <+Stormzcales_Lair> but different materials
[2:12:43] <Radioactivetaco9> That is wrong. It only gave more in world
[2:12:44] <%raggedwharfrat> Not necessarily in Rise, the materials gotten are just different.
[2:12:44] <%SaiyanShoto> But in the game some materials are only from carves
[2:12:45] <yourliteraldog> Send it to the tigrex king
[2:12:45] <%ReenMan350> i thought they changed the rewards in this game
[2:12:47] <%XzileGaming> i miss the era, where capturing and killing gave u different materials
[2:12:47] <+polothegreatest> AND easier
[2:12:48] <BinaryShuffle> Some material can only be got from carving
[2:12:48] <%Kaask> i think that was only world
[2:12:48] <%Puhff> demonstrate deez nuts psaDab
[2:12:48] <kazadog> not true
[2:12:50] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Did they change it from World where some materials can only be gotten by capturing and some only from killing?
[2:12:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> Rise changed that didn't they
[2:12:51] <+Pachi3000> you should usually be capturing
[2:12:52] <lunaamonster> aren't there some carve exclusive materials?
[2:12:52] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[2:12:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> there are some mats that you can only get/get more often with carves tho
[2:12:53] <%raggedwharfrat> It's definitely the case in world, but not in Rise.
[2:12:54] <otakon17> no, you should not capture that much
[2:12:54] <Vertigheist> but the chances of rarer mats don't drop as much
[2:12:55] <sussy_baka_999> oh no not this discussion again...
[2:12:57] <defaultname3887> not in this one pat
[2:12:58] <DusK_The_Stray> Pat, that has always been wrong
[2:12:59] <jmepik> some parts are much more common through carves though
[2:13:00] <%Bailey__Gaming> Lesson : Give Monsters ALL the Drugs
[2:13:00] <otakon17> Rise changed that
[2:13:01] <dont_call_me_steve> Rise actually has materials that can only be gotten if you kill
[2:13:01] <Profmcstevie> Very wrong
[2:13:02] <+SimplyRandy> in rise actually some mats are carve only
[2:13:03] <+Gelgatuouss> theres certain resources you can't get through trapping
[2:13:03] <wifishine> I remember when it was viable to do this in World
[2:13:03] <%cartakus> Don't care
[2:13:04] <Hydrapissed> even plague said it lol
[2:13:04] <+rumblarrock> you can tranquilize while its asleep and it wont wake up
[2:13:04] <%hotcarl6872> It just gives different materials drop rates
[2:13:04] <+ALazo> you get about the same in this one. You do get different mats sometimes though.
[2:13:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> Doesn't capturing give you LESS rewards in Rise sometimes?
[2:13:05] <DianaTheAscian> some monsters only give certain mats via carves @patstaresat
[2:13:05] <+Pachi3000> capture gang
[2:13:06] <markdreizehn> Pat to be fair, you capture them and THEN kill them at the village
[2:13:09] <otakon17> Capture gives different rewards than kills
[2:13:10] <%Sotetsu> Capturing is the worst. I wish it didn't exist.
[2:13:11] <wifishine> Not in Rise it doesn't
[2:13:11] <DaKnightWarrior> They changed it Pat.
[2:13:12] <DusK_The_Stray> You'll always be wrong, though
[2:13:14] <+mechslayer71> I kill cuz I'm a red blooded American KKonaW
[2:13:15] <+demon1103> Bad Pat!! don't teach her capture... KILL!!! screw the rewards, KILL
[2:13:15] <Hydrapissed> capping is faster though so lol
[2:13:17] <+SodiumPatrol> capping yields different rewards than killing.
[2:13:17] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Cant get claws from cap
[2:13:18] <peachy996> This is lamer than Fighting Games
[2:13:19] <%dekkitout> Can you get gems from caps?
[2:13:20] <otakon17> you can't GET some parts from caps
[2:13:20] <SulfurousAcid> kill for the satisfaction and dominance Kappa
[2:13:20] <LucasTheDrgn> I default to capturing, but I check drop rate tables if I want specific drops
[2:13:21] <AngryPumpkin1995> Capture is better
[2:13:22] <defaultname3887> no pat, there are literally some materials you can't get from capture
[2:13:23] <jmepik> you wanna carve for plates and stuff
[2:13:24] <%SaiyanShoto> I prefer to capture but in this game some materials are only from carves which sucks
[2:13:24] <%Kaask> some items have a higher chance for capture, some are only capture. world was weird and made capturing definitively better, but rise is like old games.
[2:13:25] <%fanciful_fright> Capturing is better for everything but getting gems or plates
[2:13:25] <+ocelotshotfirst> Nah, Fuck 'em
[2:13:26] <RadShiro> I think you should Capture unless you can't or you NEED to carve
[2:13:26] <%hotcarl6872> And you'll keep being wrong
[2:13:27] <+scwry> you can see the % drops in the monster notes
[2:13:27] <+SimplyRandy> rise is actually different pat
[2:13:27] <DusK_The_Stray> In fact they changed it every other game
[2:13:28] <+demonsamura> its called monster hunter not monster captureer
[2:13:29] <%TerpanderLux> :) good
[2:13:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> what kind of phrase is everyday in the world?
[2:13:31] <%DeadStage> they get PROCESSED
[2:13:31] <%Bluwizard21> it use to be carve vs cap, but in general cap yields higher drop rates for everything
[2:13:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> The important thing to know is that it varies wildly from game to game for no reason!
[2:13:34] <Lagzlot> It depends on the monster, but most of the time I cap because I don't want someone to cart 3 at the last minute.
[2:13:34] <Hydrapissed> AND SENT INTO THE ARENA TO FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES
[2:13:35] <+SodiumPatrol> do the pacifist route Kappa
[2:13:36] <%TheWinged7> It doesnt anymore in Rise, & there are carve specific drops
[2:13:37] <+geeceevee45> Or they go to a cock fighting ring
[2:13:37] <Ralfclogs> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead LUL
[2:13:38] <DrkJP520> certain materials have a higher carve rate than cap rate
[2:13:38] <kazadog> @dekkitout yes you can get gems from capping
[2:13:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> ill fight you irl for not playing the game like i do Pat
[2:13:40] <Mattais88> Or used in science experments
[2:13:40] <%Bailey__Gaming> Yay Vivisection
[2:13:41] <whimwhisp> don't they get sent to the arena?
[2:13:42] <%Nekros4442> yeah it's not any better lol
[2:13:44] <%tank7013> And in world they were put in an arena for you to beat up again
[2:13:44] <Sapphire_Breeze> KILL THEM ALL
[2:13:46] <usuallysleepy> you get worse drops from capping you ding dongs
[2:13:47] <+DizzyGunner> depends what you need, if you need a mag plate for example, it has a much better drop rate on kill
[2:13:48] <+mechslayer71> they "study" them. then use them as punching bags
[2:13:48] <%Nekros4442> They get super fucked
[2:13:49] <%doomunderthestairs> everything dies!
[2:13:50] <%raggedwharfrat> Die in Battle or Die by experimentation
[2:13:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt World always gave you more, sometimes you get less in Rise, and some mats can only be gotten by kills
[2:13:52] <AngryPumpkin1995> You're saving OTHER animals by horribly murdering these ones
[2:13:53] <DusK_The_Stray> Like, legit it changes with every game
[2:13:55] <$Artoo__The_Me> That’s not true at all
[2:13:55] <%doomunderthestairs> sipsipHellmo
[2:13:57] <%Valdorick> You can even see them in their chains, hooked to platforms.
[2:13:58] <Angerest> butchering is easier at home
[2:13:58] <T_Sasquatch> depopulation woooooooo
[2:13:59] <wifishine> LUL
[2:13:59] <DianaTheAscian> in world the realsee them
[2:14:02] <sold515> and or gladiator combat
[2:14:02] <Hydrapissed> to be fair this is post appocaplys where the monsters killed humanity so ehhh
[2:14:04] <@Ranryu692> it's Monster Hunter, not Animal Hunter
[2:14:05] <+Pachi3000> This is true also
[2:14:06] <%blastyoboots> claws
[2:14:07] <DeathByPoke7> Monster Murderer
[2:14:07] <%MooseIsGoose> In world they were caught and released
[2:14:10] <otakon17> Pat they changed it in Rise, capturing gives you different tables of rewards compared to killing and there are exclusive rewards to each method.
[2:14:10] <%cartakus> For now the humans are the monster. For now....
[2:14:13] <Mortal_Wombat_I> They catch and release them
[2:14:15] <Sternieliscious> Fun fact: If you hit Y to toggle the player display, Pat will put on sunglasses.
[2:14:15] <%TheWinged7> save the frames
[2:14:16] <%Jhylla81> Monster cockfighting
[2:14:18] <EynoStiles> Capture gives you more rewards of a certain type. but yes ut does give you more rewards
[2:14:29] <+demonsamura> playing with ranged weapons starts to hurt after a while
[2:14:31] <+Pachi3000> Sometimes you want to kill because you'll have a better chance of certain drops
[2:14:37] <otakon17> The game will even SHOW you what rewards you'll get for capping compared to killing
[2:14:37] <dont_call_me_steve> yeah it's monster specific slay-only parts
[2:14:42] <%cartakus> HH?!
[2:14:46] <DusK_The_Stray> You know, this would be a lot simpler if Pat actually read the notes in-game that prove him wrong
[2:14:48] <+bravofifeniner> "weird" aka the best one
[2:14:48] <%cartakus> dammit
[2:14:50] <otakon17> Hunting Horn
[2:14:51] <jmepik> charge blaaaade
[2:14:53] <RexSurname> wow it really looks more like classic monster unter with this UI
[2:14:56] <Lagzlot> In world capping is catch and release because they're trying to Science the monsters. The npcs even complain about you killing too many sometimes.
[2:14:59] <otakon17> it's like the Hammer but with buffs for the whole team
[2:14:59] <Radioactivetaco9> capturing gives 2-3 rewards while killing always gives 3 (or sometimes 4 if you eat the carving dango)
[2:15:00] <dont_call_me_steve> GUNLANCE CHADS RISE UP
[2:15:01] <+scwry> are you any good with longsword? itll be fun to show her the counters
[2:15:06] <EynoStiles> The end of quest screen gives you more rewards because you get and extra bar of rewards. so yes you get more rewards
[2:15:07] <%GinAndRoses> yeeaaahhhh funlance
[2:15:10] <+broaches> did peach setup a basic item loadout yet?
[2:15:10] <DaKnightWarrior> Only in World they set the monsters free.
[2:15:15] <+OctaivianRex> Hey that's my weird weapon!
[2:15:15] <whimwhisp> Oh my favorite <3~
[2:15:15] <EDFscout> Lmao most the weapons are weird
[2:15:17] <+PrimalDweeb> You smoke them
[2:15:25] <%D00msDayDan> urbs
[2:15:28] <%cartakus> oh boy here we go...
[2:15:30] <dont_call_me_steve> @scwry ironically gunlance is just as fun with counters
[2:15:32] <thunderborn32> @scwry paige can't dark souls parry
[2:15:39] <+polothegreatest> core woolieF
[2:15:43] <EynoStiles> @lagzlot Actually no. they get ship off to the arena where you can kill them there
[2:15:55] <+rumblarrock> In case they changed it at some point you can tranq sleeping monsters and they don't wake up
[2:15:55] <Exeerdna> annytfREEE beeewiRee SilverREE we're not the bad guys
[2:15:57] <dont_call_me_steve> we mined, now we craft
[2:16:21] <otakon17> you don't even need to tranq sleeping monsters, just put a trap under them and it's an instant cap
[2:16:22] <+demonsamura> why do they gotta make the monsties fight to the death?
[2:16:27] <+scwry> @dont_call_me_steve true its my 2nd main
[2:16:28] <jmepik> I fucking love monster hunter
[2:16:47] <+scwry> @thunderborn32 I meant pat goes longsowrd and show off
[2:16:48] <dont_call_me_steve> ahh good shit
[2:16:49] <+Pachi3000> You can hold the Craft option to just let it keep going
[2:16:51] <LucasTheDrgn> A, pat
[2:16:54] <jmepik> @otakon17 you absolutely need to tranq wtf
[2:16:56] <%cartakus> Only thing that matters  max potion and ammo for now
[2:16:58] <dont_call_me_steve> it overtook hammer for me in Rise
[2:17:00] <+mechslayer71> @otakon17 surely you're trolling now
[2:17:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> potion seller, i need your dankest potions
[2:17:09] <+AWr00tBear> Teach her to pet the dog!
[2:17:10] <DusK_The_Stray> Dankest Potions
[2:17:12] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> 4 page's of amm
[2:17:12] <+Pachi3000> @otakon17 that's completely wrong
[2:17:14] <%XzileGaming> remember when there was blue mushrooms in potions
[2:17:17] <SulfurousAcid> because honey is magic
[2:17:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> i've got a party coming up
[2:17:31] <+PrimalDweeb> Right, because that makes sense.
[2:17:32] <+demonsamura> do you guys use double dogs?
[2:17:35] <jmepik> remember when mega potions were a rare commodity in early game
[2:17:37] <+scwry> @otakon17 you keep giving wrong info and its not helping
[2:17:37] <+Pachi3000> SOME stuff you can only craft
[2:17:38] <%Sotetsu> Estus streamlining the healing process is the best thing to happen to gaming.
[2:17:40] <otakon17> ...well it's been a while since I played, I swear I remember in World that sleeping monsters are auto-capped when trapped
[2:17:41] <T_Sasquatch> oh man seeing chat talk about a game series i have thousandds of hours in is hilarious
[2:17:43] <Reanimator83> Guys, he's been trolling
[2:17:49] <%cade_calrayn> She's getting into it!
[2:17:57] <Profmcstevie> What you REMEMBER is not what you know
[2:18:10] <otakon17> I said it's been a while dammit
[2:18:15] <Mattais88> I can't belive I have 250 hours clocked on the switch version
[2:18:16] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Helmet
[2:18:17] <dont_call_me_steve> @otakon17 it's if they've been trapped, you can throw a tranq at any point after and it works
[2:18:17] <+Pachi3000> @otakon17 In Rise putting a trap under a sleeping monster will make them wake up in the trap, you still have to tranq them afterward
[2:18:18] <+demonsamura> i dont know what i remember
[2:18:20] <%tank7013> @otakon17 You might be remembering trapping the monster *after* hitting them with tranqs. Which does work
[2:18:22] <$realm_forge> I’m about to start brewing my own mead and I can confirm that honey is maniacal
[2:18:24] <jmepik> izuchi is nice
[2:18:31] <sussy_baka_999> He never should have mentioned the capture rewards, people love giving their opinion on it
[2:18:31] <DaKnightWarrior> @t_sasquatch only thousands Kappa
[2:18:32] <+OctaivianRex> "You cannot learn a thing you THINK you know."
[2:18:36] <%XzileGaming> Peach "Uh" Saliva
[2:18:38] <+scwry> izuchi is nice attack up
[2:18:49] <%FacetiousAF> hmm yes hmmmm

[2:20:47] <%JenovasPuppet> Paige 2 doesn't exist because Paige is one of a kind.
[2:20:55] <%cooldude69xx> How is paige dealing with "big number: the action story?"
[2:20:56] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS !

[2:23:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> AngriestWee
[2:24:00] <thunderborn32> it took me so so long to let go of full sets to put my clown suit on
[2:24:06] <%TerpanderLux> chjbBoClap
[2:24:10] <%Dakuu75> Paige, if you're in chat. You should know, you've done EVERY RIGHT so far. Especially for a beginner.
[2:24:13] <%zarkazeon> SHES DOING IT!!! SHES BELIEVING!!!
[2:24:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat Wee's At
[2:24:19] <otakon17> but yeah sheer numbers are the best thing to go with in the early game
[2:24:23] <dont_call_me_steve> the clown suit is life
[2:24:23] <+Nkbzodiac> all this explanation all that matters is FASHION
[2:24:29] <otakon17> I have a feeling Paige is gonna kick ass at this game
[2:24:31] <+ocelotshotfirst> Wish List
[2:24:35] <+Pachi3000> @thunderborn32 Same lol, I was like 100 hours in on Switch before I started trying out weirdo combinations
[2:25:00] <T_Sasquatch> fashion or die
[2:25:01] <+Pachi3000> hells yeah
[2:25:02] <%TerpanderLux> its like amazon :)
[2:25:10] <otakon17> And the wishlist will tell you when you have the parts to craft it
[2:25:13] <+dante_must_die_exe> PAT, go do the Gotta Hoard Fast event quest
[2:25:21] <T_Sasquatch> i had so many weird as hell load out synergies with the fashion i had LUL
[2:25:24] <+scwry> hey boys my birthday is coming up heres my amazon wishlist ;)
[2:25:38] <Mattais88> Register at the Kamura Ikea
[2:25:43] <+Pachi3000> And every time you return from a hunt, you'll be told if you have the materials to make them
[2:25:43] <%cartakus> LUL LUL
[2:25:44] <otakon17> I still wish you could trade parts in the MH games though
[2:25:51] <%TerpanderLux> huh...
[2:26:02] <+scwry> izuchi round 2
[2:26:05] <@Ranryu692> oot and aboot
[2:26:08] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[2:26:20] <%tank7013> I think hitting rb also just shows you a list of everything you need by itself
[2:26:25] <+PrimalDweeb> @_@ This is a lot to learn on your own. Pat was right about needing a friend to learn this game.
[2:26:28] <@Ranryu692> that feature should be standard in any game with crafting
[2:26:31] <otakon17> so how many times do you think you have to hunt a single monster to get an entire kit for them?
[2:26:40] <otakon17> I'd say five times on average
[2:26:40] <%TerpanderLux> izuchi weapons are good too :)
[2:26:44] <%GinAndRoses> fashion!
[2:26:45] <+treace8k> facts

[2:27:54] <%TerpanderLux> 3U was my first and i would never fucking go back to it
[2:27:54] <TyKun04> Old monster hunter was great, but more confusing and stupid
[2:27:56] <%RustyCoyoteA> Ahhhh back in the days when it was blast ailment or bust
[2:27:59] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt bring back swimming losers
[2:28:00] <%oda_flobunaga> What about 1?
[2:28:02] <SulfurousAcid> remember when you needed to use The Claw to play it?
[2:28:02] <stratrat13> be jealous paige i got mcdonalds :3
[2:28:04] <%BlueLunecy> And we LIKED IT
[2:28:04] <%raggedwharfrat> God I hope this isn't actually MH6
[2:28:05] <Marhunter7> and MH on the PS2 is for soulless crazy people (speaking of myself)
[2:28:06] <dont_call_me_steve> world rocked
[2:28:06] <+DizzyGunner> but then you get the freaks complaining the grognar bullshit is gone LUL
[2:28:07] <@ssjklyco> In my day, we had to throw paint on the monsters
[2:28:08] <fairore> glad i dont have to go back anymore
[2:28:08] <VierLeger> bUt It'S cAsUaL nOw
[2:28:10] <SulfurousAcid> I remember needing the claw on the psp
[2:28:10] <otakon17> like before you'd have to waste inventory space on tools to harvest materials for crafting
[2:28:13] <+SodiumPatrol> tfw started on ps2
[2:28:14] <Ner234> Back in MY day *shakes fist*
[2:28:16] <%cartakus> Back in my day shit was fucked
[2:28:18] <dont_call_me_steve> GU is also great, you can play as a kitty cat
[2:28:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's more for metahumans at the moment. give it a few games
[2:28:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> back in my day, hammers only swung one way!
[2:28:22] <%raggedwharfrat> Oh man, fuck the Claw Grip by the way
[2:28:28] <+scwry> going back to the switch release of GU AFTER world came out was painful and amazing
[2:28:28] <Mattais88> I have cookies, better than mcdonalds
[2:28:28] <otakon17> oh god I remember trying to play MonHun on the PS2
[2:28:29] <+SimplyRandy> i remember swinging with the freaking right analog stick
[2:28:34] <stratrat13> omfg she said my name omfg omfg omfg omfg
[2:28:37] <otakon17> the Right stick attack method was HORRIBLE
[2:28:37] <DaKnightWarrior> Back in MY DAY we used Paint Balls.
[2:28:37] <yourliteraldog> has sheen the little girl one
[2:28:37] <sonicblade38> rember when u had to use the right stick to attack
[2:28:38] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[2:28:38] <+GrassCannon> I skipped from 3 to Rise and just thought "Oh my god, this game is playable!"
[2:28:43] <+Pachi3000> HAI!
[2:28:45] <Srthunda> back in my day, we had to hunt underwater
[2:28:45] <%cooldude69xx> @cartakus AND we liked it that way
[2:28:46] <%Blank9> sell out to become human+ to learn monster hunt
[2:28:48] <%tank7013> @RetroCop87 4U had like a little rumble but the huge jump was definitely with World
[2:28:50] <SulfurousAcid> playing with claw grip like a crazy person
[2:28:53] <usuallysleepy> they really casualized and ruin the series by, checks notes, removing bug nets!
[2:28:56] <stratrat13> hello new text alert
[2:28:57] <sold515> 4U is my favourite, but holy fuck the kinsect upgrade system was some 7th dimension ARG shit
[2:28:58] <%Mtome> Dude I just got into the High Rank hunts and they're s much fun! Can't wait for Pat And Paige to get to them.
[2:28:59] <%cartakus> fuck sake
[2:29:00] <%RustyCoyoteA> Food make big and strong
[2:29:01] <Jaller101514> Pat dances when he makes food?
[2:29:03] <+MediocreHermits> yep the good old days of playing monster hunter freedom on psp
[2:29:07] <+DizzyGunner> or as me and my mates do
[2:29:11] <otakon17> Three Ultimate wasn't that bad to be honest...except you had to play it on a 3DS and had to CLAW to camera
[2:29:11] <Vertigheist> back in my day we couldn't jump
[2:29:13] <+DizzyGunner> mash the button and piss everyone off
[2:29:16] <TyKun04> Is that pats version of the banjo kazooie song?
[2:29:19] <+scwry> I miss sword and shield oils
[2:29:22] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt you should show her the world food cutscenes
[2:29:27] <dont_call_me_steve> is he gonna blast dash
[2:29:29] <stratrat13> large vanilla shake and 2 bigmacs paige
[2:29:32] <+Pachi3000> oh man I tried the Gun Lance, it's weird
[2:29:34] <DusK_The_Stray> You could have also played 3U on Wii U
[2:29:34] <%GinAndRoses> I love you gunlance
[2:29:34] <%TerpanderLux> @sold515 "7th dimension ARG" is so fuckin funny
[2:29:35] <otakon17> Gunlace is BIG damage
[2:29:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's a big RWBY
[2:29:36] <dont_call_me_steve> I hope he blast dashes
[2:29:36] <+geeceevee45> Gunlance PogChamp
[2:29:41] <DusK_The_Stray> Which had online
[2:29:45] <BinaryShuffle> The charge blade is gonna blow her mind
[2:29:47] <%dekkitout> Whip out the swing lance
[2:29:49] <DaKnightWarrior> The Funlance!
[2:29:50] <otakon17> DO THE SLAM SHOT PAT!
[2:29:51] <Ner234> The FUNlance
[2:29:52] <%cartakus> Should not have a fucking shield. Make it a gun halberd!
[2:29:56] <otakon17> Wyvern Stake
[2:29:58] <+scwry> you can also ROCKET JUMP
[2:30:03] <%Bluwizard21> I guess I'm gettin monhun for pc and pickin up h bowgun again.
[2:30:09] <TheDr0t> wait since when is Pat's game is fullscreen? @patstaresat
[2:30:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> I wonder if they got rid of gunlance having like 5 different builds
[2:30:12] <jmepik> play every weapon at least once
[2:30:12] <%Focant> Focant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:30:13] <Lagzlot> The most disappointing thing about gunlance in Rise is that the cornpopper no longer makes slide whistle noises.
[2:30:14] <%DeadStage> learn about the different hammer charge types
[2:30:14] <%mai_waifu_> she will never switch off hammer
[2:30:14] <@ssjklyco> It fires in spurts. If it shoots ya, it's gonna hurt
[2:30:16] <jmepik> eventually
[2:30:16] <+SodiumPatrol> GL is a true patrician weapon
[2:30:17] <dont_call_me_steve> fun fact, Wide shelling's wyrmstake deals KO damage like the hammer
[2:30:19] <+soycanadiense> I'm all alone on a Saturday night. I'm stuck on the CAF Navy Base, I'm gonna get drunk and order a pizza.
[2:30:24] <+scwry> longsword is beginner friendly with a high skill ceiling
[2:30:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> Greatsword is also a great starter weapon
[2:30:24] <+ocelotshotfirst> BIG GUN TIME
[2:30:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> hammer is GREAT FOR STARTING
[2:30:28] <$Artoo__The_Me> Charge blade :)
[2:30:29] <arronash91> Go to training room at village to try weapons
[2:30:34] <%TerpanderLux> killed
[2:30:39] <otakon17> THE KAMEKAMEHA!
[2:30:39] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:30:45] <%cartakus> Or you can do like me and learn nearly all weapons escept for lance
[2:30:50] <Lagzlot> Gunlance: the friendly firing squad.
[2:30:52] <@Ranryu692> but wait, there's more!
[2:30:55] <%Blank9> lance might be good for starting too, but less a paige weapon
[2:30:55] <otakon17> the ROCKET launch
[2:30:56] <dont_call_me_steve> yeeeeaaaaahhh
[2:30:57] <T_Sasquatch> WHAT
[2:30:57] <+Pachi3000> this is how you fly
[2:30:58] <%dekkitout> What kind of shelling is this one
[2:30:59] <whimwhisp> rocket jumpppp
[2:30:59] <T_Sasquatch> holy shit
[2:31:00] <%GinAndRoses> YEEAAAHHHH
[2:31:03] <jmepik> @plagueofgripes wide/normal/long is still a thing
[2:31:05] <%FacetiousAF> Jank
[2:31:06] <+bravofifeniner> gunlance has one of the easiest loops
[2:31:07] <otakon17> oh no the turns aren't gonna be tight
[2:31:08] <MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp
[2:31:08] <%JenovasPuppet> lol people were complaining that hammer was "too complicated" for Paige. You just wack things with it!
[2:31:10] <%TerpanderLux> youre controlling a weird vehicle
[2:31:13] <+Pachi3000> movement in Monster Hunter is DELIBERATE
[2:31:13] <ruleofthespear> chunky
[2:31:14] <otakon17> it's Dark Souls but less jank
[2:31:14] <%Dakuu75> I spent like an hour trying to wire-bug to the coohoot-nest and JUST figured out, you can jsut climb the back of the damn tree
[2:31:15] <+scwry> triple rocket jump too
[2:31:16] <$Artoo__The_Me> Do the slam with the burst pat!
[2:31:16] <%GinAndRoses> turning radius of a battleship
[2:31:16] <%RustyCoyoteA> Yep. That’s how you turn lol
[2:31:19] <+Pachi3000> VERY deliberate
[2:31:21] <%cartakus> Is it?
[2:31:21] <fatalDestiny> You must drive your character like a car.
[2:31:22] <%TheWinged7> Hammer is great to start off, and if she wants to try something else throw horn at her
[2:31:23] <dont_call_me_steve> @dekkitout normal with load shells
[2:31:25] <%JenovasPuppet> Dark Souls but just fight bosses all the time.
[2:31:26] <jmepik> but there's still only one or two good gunlances to make in the very end
[2:31:31] <%tank7013> It's definitely not on unpatched Witcher 3 level but yea
[2:31:31] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:31:33] <otakon17> Hammer is really simple
[2:31:34] <+Pachi3000> pipi time
[2:31:36] <%TerpanderLux> lets all go pee
[2:31:41] <T_Sasquatch> i do mind
[2:31:41] <%TerpanderLux> ok :)
[2:31:41] <+OctaivianRex> To avoid the spin attack don't press a direct when you release the charge attack.
[2:31:43] <TyKun04> And it totally inspired dark souls
[2:31:46] <+Mrbaconator> like FRYING CHICKEN
[2:31:46] <%TerpanderLux> PWSHSHHSHSHSHHSHHSHSHHS!!!!
[2:31:47] <%cartakus> Nah
[2:31:47] <ruleofthespear> PSHHHHHHH
[2:31:48] <%barrakuta371> pssssssssssshhhhhhhh
[2:31:48] <%Birdigalore> leave the mic on
[2:31:49] <dont_call_me_steve> pssssssasssssstttt
[2:31:51] <%Hamborgini> fartpiss
[2:31:51] <%Dakuu75> Has to sound like fried chicken
[2:31:51] <%KetsuoTaberu> why is your dick farting
[2:31:52] <otakon17> it's mostly "Charge and hold till you hit the level you want to attack with"
[2:31:52] <%baka_sugoi> Pee HARD
[2:31:53] <CrimsonGargoyle> A LOT LOL
[2:31:53] <T_Sasquatch> dont do that !
[2:31:54] <%blaccbird914> we shall pee and regroup
[2:31:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> like a deflating balloon
[2:31:56] <BinaryShuffle> like a charge rifle...
[2:31:57] <otakon17> fry some chicken
[2:31:57] <VierLeger> Pat frying chicken in there
[2:31:58] <thunderborn32> take a minute and breath is a requirement for mon hun
[2:31:58] <%GinAndRoses> nasty
[2:31:59] <%tank7013> Having a chicken frying contest out here
[2:32:00] <%dekkitout> S(PEE)d Runs
[2:32:01] <+SodiumPatrol> hot mic
[2:32:02] <T_Sasquatch> thats how you hurt yourself
[2:32:03] <yukichocomilk> hel
[2:32:05] <DeathByPoke7> I just finished peeing :(
[2:32:06] <Lagzlot> "How hard you can pee": queue the gunlance rocket jump montage.
[2:32:06] <$Artoo__The_Me> THE HOOD REMAINED
[2:32:10] <DaKnightWarrior> Every weapon is a fighting game character.
[2:32:16] <+ArsCaelia> but what if i don't HAVE to pee
[2:32:22] <+SimplyRandy> remember to always stretch before you pee
[2:32:23] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt why does your piss fart?
[2:32:24] <MageValerie> I finished my pizza and it was delicious but there was a piggy trying to steal from me
[2:32:25] <%KetsuoTaberu> dick gonna explode and unpeel like a cartoon musket
[2:32:25] <DaKnightWarrior> so good.
[2:32:35] <%tank7013> So that rocket jump is that a switch skill or does gunlance just start with that?
[2:32:36] <jmepik> @daknightwarrior that's how I explain it to friends
[2:32:37] <churropoppa> @ArsCaelia shit yourself
[2:32:42] <MageValerie> complicated saturday nights yanno
[2:32:48] <+scwry> @tank7013 its a switch skill
[2:32:49] <+SimplyRandy> @tank7013 it's a switch skill
[2:32:51] <%cartakus> @ketsuotaberu wtf?
[2:32:56] <otakon17> anyway again, wanna apologize for the bad info I was putting out earlier; it wasn't meant to be trolling it was just my brain being stupid and misrembering things from World.
[2:33:02] <%TheWinged7> @tank7013 its a switch skill, it can be used in the air to absolutely yeet
[2:33:12] <dont_call_me_steve> you good
[2:33:12] <stratrat13> im stoked ive had paige and pat say things about me that make text alerts pats was from the very beginning of the bloodborne streams part 3 at the start
[2:33:16] <otakon17> so GL FINALLY has some mobility
[2:33:19] <%KetsuoTaberu> @cartakus you heard me
[2:33:29] <otakon17> that's pretty sweet
[2:33:31] <jmepik> so what does everyone main
[2:33:32] <thunderborn32> @otakon17 yeah rise has some big and very small changes from world
[2:33:33] <%tank7013> @scwry @SimplyRandy @TheWinged7 I see. Thanks y'all doodGood
[2:33:36] <%cartakus> man....
[2:33:41] <dont_call_me_steve> you can full burst from a blast dash, waaay faster than doing the combo
[2:33:53] <+SimplyRandy> @jmepik Charge Blade
[2:33:56] <%cartakus> All the weapons save for lance
[2:34:00] <otakon17> I mained Hammer and Lance in World, IG in 4U and Generations
[2:34:03] <jmepik> gap closer into burst, it's great
[2:34:05] <Ghufufin> swaxe
[2:34:10] <otakon17> I could never get the hang of GS though
[2:34:11] <SulfurousAcid> @jmepik switch axe
[2:34:15] <%KetsuoTaberu> I was lance in world, but apparently it got nerfed hard in rise so idk
[2:34:25] <%RustyCoyoteA> Lance and Horn
[2:34:27] <dont_call_me_steve> Lance went from the best it ever was in ib to... whatever it is now
[2:34:34] <thunderborn32> 'nerfed'
[2:34:37] <otakon17> like I tried, and tried and tried and I always ended up missing by like an inch or never in the right position to hit anything ...then again I mostly played solo
[2:34:47] <stratrat13> whats the coolest weapon just from hearing its name?  i say gunlanve
[2:34:49] <jmepik> @ketsuotaberu it's still good, LS just overshadows all melee now
[2:34:49] <RadShiro> i want to like GreatSword but my baby brain might be too baby for it
[2:34:52] <otakon17> I love lance for the defense since I'm not great with dodge timing
[2:34:52] <stratrat13> lance*
[2:34:52] <+SimplyRandy> @ketsuotaberu it's just boring now. you're only real way to deal damage is the same charge swipe over and over
[2:34:59] <+treace8k> leighxLeigh
[2:35:02] <otakon17> the coolest weapon? Charge Blade by far
[2:35:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @otakon17 GS is just big hit > sheathe > run around looklng for another opportunity > repeat
[2:35:10] <%cartakus> Charge blade sounds pretty cool
[2:35:12] <+treace8k> forsenPls PartyParrot forsenPls
[2:35:15] <%KetsuoTaberu> @jmepik gotcha
[2:35:16] <DaKnightWarrior> Lance was king in gen 1. now it's...
[2:35:16] <TheRealNumberJ42> swagaxe > everything
[2:35:17] <%D00msDayDan> damn pat's still blasting piss out i already finished
[2:35:17] <+SergeEXE> Charge Blade was so busted in 4U
[2:35:19] <+treace8k> forsenPls
[2:35:21] <%KetsuoTaberu> @SimplyRandy good to know
[2:35:24] <jmepik> charge blade main through and through, GS is my second
[2:35:29] <otakon17> Swaxe is also VERY cool looking
[2:35:30] <+SimplyRandy> ever since world added the shoulder tackle though, great sword is bad ass as hell
[2:35:38] <+treace8k> PartyParrot
[2:35:42] <+SergeEXE> Swaxe is so dope in Rise though
[2:35:43] <+SimplyRandy> nothing like shoulder bashing a dive bombing nergigante
[2:35:43] <dont_call_me_steve> the switch axe in this game can fuckin divebomb
[2:35:47] <%RustyCoyoteA> @otakon17 and then there’s evade lancing builds lik
[2:35:50] <otakon17> which one has the Elemental Discharge again, I forgot. CB wasn't it?
[2:35:50] <+SergeEXE> They finally made the Axe part relevant again
[2:35:51] <%TerpanderLux> hammer and sns are my sons
[2:35:54] <jmepik> @sergeexe and yet IG and GS still got the better times
[2:35:57] <stratrat13> im a charge blade main but gunlance just sounds better to me from its name.  ik the weapons btw just bringing up shit :P
[2:35:59] <Slim_Lipid> @D00msDayDan don't forget he has to strip entirely then re-clothe everytime he encounters a toilet
[2:36:03] <jmepik> I'm still salty about Gen CB LOL
[2:36:06] <otakon17> oh man I tried to evade Lance, I only had minimal success
[2:36:08] <%TerpanderLux> i peed so hard i flooded and cracked the toilet also
[2:36:09] <%baka_sugoi> ew
[2:36:09] <+SimplyRandy> @otakon17 ye its chargeblade
[2:36:10] <+SergeEXE> @jmepik so?
[2:36:10] <Ner234> You FORGOT
[2:36:12] <%FacetiousAF> sounded like fried chicken ON STREAM
[2:36:13] <RLT917> atpRtsd
[2:36:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> peed so hard he blacked out
[2:36:16] <%skrewarrior> what the fuck pat
[2:36:17] <+OctaivianRex> @otakon17 Switch Axe is Paige's two favorite Bloodborne weapons combined but the meter management might be a bit overwhelming.
[2:36:18] <%cvp5127> Kappa
[2:36:24] <DusK_The_Stray> Lmao
[2:36:25] <dont_call_me_steve> I cut my toilet with my piss stream

[2:41:22] <otakon17> Follow that weasel raptor!
[2:41:30] <+Pachi3000> dog sometimes wigs out
[2:41:36] <%cartakus> Tyat bird is the umbrela yokai from nioh
[2:41:39] <+OctaivianRex> Don't forget to carve some of the small guys for sharp claws.
[2:41:45] <+treace8k> LUL he just wanted the tire
[2:41:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> the dog off licking his nuts does happen a bit too often
[2:42:03] <otakon17> run Paige!
[2:42:14] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Time for bed. I have to go to work during a freezing rain with 36 mph winds whilst getting over the flu (cause my job doesn't care as long as it isn't covid).
[2:42:18] <thunderborn32> did pat teach her to call the dog?
[2:42:20] <Slim_Lipid> i find it works way better to dog up from the action bar rather than holding B
[2:42:21] <Ipsenscastle> remember to sharpen your dog
[2:42:21] <otakon17> Fireball barrage
[2:42:35] <Fien111> Dog ain't gonna leave nuts unlicked, that just ain't right by dog law
[2:42:40] <jmepik> @plagueofgripes you can use the radial menu to call him and mount up even when he's distracted
[2:42:41] <+Pachi3000> various stats, not just attack
[2:42:42] <otakon17> affinity bonuses, I like the endemic life boosts
[2:42:44] <jmepik> a nice summon
[2:42:46] <+SimplyRandy> setting dog behavior to "follow" also helps make it much more available to ride
[2:42:47] <Profmcstevie> Helper fish
[2:42:48] <tolloponik> I love those fish
[2:42:49] <otakon17> oh neat
[2:42:51] <athuramn> I can't believe how much the series has come along

[2:42:55] <%cartakus> @bluwizard21 good luck
[2:42:58] <athuramn> so much qol
[2:43:13] <%Cozy90> I'm sad no Baan ion this game.I loved his armor/
[2:43:28] <otakon17> YES
[2:43:32] <otakon17> that's the BEST feeling
[2:43:32] <%TerpanderLux> yeah
[2:43:34] <%cade_calrayn> PAIGE HAS SKILLS
[2:43:34] <+Pachi3000> she's learning to believe
[2:43:36] <%cvp5127> yeyeye
[2:43:37] <$scallycap> the true Dark Souls starts here
[2:43:37] <@ssjklyco> Like a gun to a fish
[2:43:39] <otakon17> nailing the head JUST at the right time
[2:43:41] <%RetroCop87> like a screen door on a submarine
[2:43:41] <DaKnightWarrior> SeemsGood
[2:43:43] <MelfinaStarwind> aw he just wanted her to know how big spin lgwBeg
[2:43:44] <+OctaivianRex> Good one pat.
[2:43:45] <otakon17> "She's believing"
[2:43:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> is paige the barrel or the fish?
[2:43:50] <Profmcstevie> Like shooting.....gnomes in a....pot of gold
[2:43:53] <%FacetiousAF> pat needs more triangle+circle
[2:43:54] <MidnightPacif1c> BIG AND STRONG
[2:43:56] <%MelBrooksKA> That's a malform
[2:43:58] <%azacca_bitter> He ain't wrong
[2:43:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> pat has been saying things wrong and weird today
[2:44:00] <%skrewarrior> paige has mastered the hammer
[2:44:02] <+OctaivianRex> Wow.
[2:44:04] <EDFscout> Just like a gun in water or whatever
[2:44:04] <+treace8k> She beginign to belive
[2:44:09] <$Trenr> possibly all the dark souls has prepared her for this
[2:44:14] <%OrangeMDT> Fish love being in barrels
[2:44:14] <Profmcstevie> The level design is not giving her a migraine after all
[2:44:14] <+ocelotshotfirst> Today?
[2:44:16] <animaturgy> She's better at this *because* of dark souls!
[2:44:16] <Ghufufin> paige just pretends every monster is a woman that needs to die
[2:44:17] <%TheWinged7> dark souls probably helped
[2:44:19] <otakon17> DOG RIDIN'!
[2:44:19] <%cartakus> Dark souls is not the best action game there is
[2:44:20] <stratrat13> yeah paige ik you dont think you know what youre doing but it really looks like you do
[2:44:20] <+Pachi3000> ftr you can't cut off Izuchi tails
[2:44:22] <otakon17> GO GET'EM PAPY!
[2:44:23] <T_Sasquatch> is paige still playing xiv ?
[2:44:23] <@ssjklyco> I called it that paige would be better than expected seeing how she one shots hard souls bosses
[2:44:23] <thunderborn32> @Trenr absolutely
[2:44:26] <+chiazam> I still can't get over how much health monsters seem to have
[2:44:26] <%hairtoday> papyrus on top
[2:44:29] <otakon17> WAIT
[2:44:33] <+OctaivianRex> This game doesn't kill you right away like Dark Souls. It overwhelms you with menus.
[2:44:33] <otakon17> DID SHE NAME HER CAT ELMO!?
[2:44:51] <%cade_calrayn> oh yeah what she'd name her cat, Pat
[2:44:52] <MageValerie> @otakon17 Pat did at least
[2:44:56] <+Pachi3000> ALSO, his tail attack will be less potent, or he won't do it at all
[2:44:56] <%Jhylla81> I kinda wish monsters had health bars
[2:44:57] <%TheWinged7> i know a few pople, myself included, who bounced off mon hun, then went from souls to mon hun  and it clicked
[2:45:03] <otakon17> @chiazam only seems that way due to weak tier 1 weapons, later on you can clear monsters from HR1 with endgame weapons in a few minutes
[2:45:08] <stratrat13> also dodging monster attacks took me a biot to get used to how mh does it
[2:45:11] <+OctaivianRex> @chiazam It's crazy because when you get good you are literally wrecking the early guys in like five minutes.
[2:45:15] <stratrat13> bit*
[2:45:23] <+treace8k> loot loot
[2:45:25] <+polothegreatest> dude am playing outriders, is still good? LUL
[2:45:26] <+ScrapKingKeita> what was wrong with Outriders aside from it being unplayable for like, a month?
[2:45:26] <%TerpanderLux> monhun and 14 are the only time vampire games worth playing
[2:45:28] <%cartakus> Is her cat named sans?

[2:46:06] <%kyh9> And we're playing RE5 together
[2:46:08] <Tomschiii> @jhylla81 that would be horrible
[2:46:13] <sold515> two things i definitely have

[2:46:25] <%kyh9> Now my girl hums the Safe room theme from RE4 every time we're in a warm room from the cold
[2:46:26] <%FacetiousAF> GUNLANCE RULES
[2:46:31] <otakon17> and once you get the hang of it you can average most hunts around 15 minutes
[2:46:41] <fairore> @scwry zaww
[2:46:43] <%TerpanderLux> a big green bug
[2:46:44] <%kyh9> I can't wait to see Paige reactions to all sorts of monsters
[2:46:45] <%notsoy> do you not chop tails off anymore?
[2:46:48] <Slim_Lipid> are minions synced?
[2:46:57] <%kyh9> I can't wait to see her reaction to Magnamalo for instance
[2:46:59] <MelfinaStarwind> lahabrea
[2:47:00] <%Dakuu75> Is Rise planned to get support and new content, equal to World
[2:47:00] <jetstreamlove_R> I can't believe you cut a tail whit a gunlance on a great Izuchi of all monsters
[2:47:01] <Profmcstevie> *dead* bug
[2:47:03] <jmepik> @notsoy izuchi too smol for that
[2:47:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Vampy bitme is playing Mon Hun too. must be something in the air

[2:47:49] <jetstreamlove_R> The gunlance is such an impractical weapon against a small monster!
[2:47:52] <thunderborn32> hunter rule #1 NOTHING goes to waste
[2:48:00] <stratrat13> theyre materials nothing more
[2:48:02] <otakon17> Pat can't make himself

[2:48:25] <stratrat13> they may live and breathe but omg this hat
[2:48:25] <sheepymcsheeperton> It sucks for guys with big beards
[2:48:33] <Slim_Lipid> they use every part of the Bullfango
[2:48:39] <Slim_Lipid> even the poop
[2:48:41] <%Mtome> I had to lower the voice frequency in the game, everytime my hunter would scream "monster meet mr. weapon" I would die a little inside
[2:48:44] <otakon17> nothing goes to waste
[2:48:59] <+Pachi3000> fuckin bnnuy
[2:49:01] <otakon17> time to watch ANOTHER turf war
[2:49:06] <%Dakuu75> the beard options in this game were the biggest disappointment so far, yeah
[2:49:06] <fairore> @Slim_Lipid even the touge?
[2:49:08] <jetstreamlove_R> most of the time as selling material cause boy you rarely use them as soon as you find the optimal build
[2:49:08] <otakon17> RIDE THAT POLAR RABBIT
[2:49:26] <vile_brand> oh look it has watership downsyndrome

[2:49:50] <+Pachi3000> he also rollll
[2:49:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> the worst monster type in the game
[2:49:53] <%MooseIsGoose> Man its cold where I am at and I am about to get some pho
[2:49:56] <+chiazam> JUST DIE ALREADY
[2:49:58] <otakon17> Fanged Beasts are basically "based on real life mammals" far as I recall
[2:50:03] <jetstreamlove_R> No Bulldrome to count thank god
[2:50:08] <DusK_The_Stray> @TurtlesAndTentacles It's not a wyvern
[2:50:17] <%TheWinged7> bnnuy butt

[2:50:19] <fairore> @jetstreamlove_R ugh
[2:50:19] <@ssjklyco> I love that it's pat that's getting the most distracted
[2:50:19] <%Dakuu75> he slip'n slides all over the place and just says, "fuck you physics" the whole time lol
[2:50:38] <Zombrocom> I love lagombi what a character
[2:50:45] <otakon17> HE'S ANGRY
[2:50:47] <Slim_Lipid> GOd if they add Bulldrome in sunbreak and they give it the Garuga treatment LUL Kreygasm
[2:50:52] <jetstreamlove_R> Would love to see the Mammoth to make a comeback, got a godly armor too
[2:50:54] <Zombrocom> Silly slidy ice bunny bear
[2:51:02] <Profmcstevie> Lagombi higher rank when he starts rolling snowballs at you is fun
[2:51:10] <jmepik> Gammoth X is soooo sick
[2:51:13] <stratrat13> you know how paige has a thing for skeletons.  i do for girl skeletons
[2:51:17] <otakon17> I wonder if the Zamtrios will come back
[2:51:21] <jmepik> big ass cape
[2:51:22] <stratrat13> and you know what i realized
[2:51:26] <%dantejoestar21> dantejoestar21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[2:51:31] <VierLeger> Go for the eyes, Papyrus!
[2:51:31] <+OctaivianRex> Paige is way ahead of you on that.
[2:51:34] <%Valdorick> sploosh
[2:51:35] <+leviting> its wild how effective blocking is
[2:51:38] <Ipsenscastle> this is a durable izuchi
[2:51:39] <%cartakus> Ah yes girl skeletons
[2:51:41] <stratrat13> both boy and girl skeletons look the same
[2:51:42] <otakon17> he's tired, LAY INTO HIM!
[2:51:43] <%Cozy90> papyrus blood thirsty
[2:51:44] <jetstreamlove_R> Gammoth is one of the few unique looking monsters in the series too
[2:52:15] <%Dakuu75> I feel like the evade window is far more forgiving in Rise, than World
[2:52:16] <otakon17> @leviting it gets even better with Guard and Guard Up, you can basically block ANYTHING at that point with no chip damage or knockback
[2:52:21] <RLT917> @stratrat13 atpBigot
[2:52:22] <%echobee_tv> Did Capcom invite y'all for that hunt/subathon thing?
[2:52:23] <+OctaivianRex> Pat your Wirebug Guard skill can combo directly into Wyrmstake if you didn't know.
[2:52:28] <%notsoy> gore magala when
[2:52:32] <otakon17> sleep bombing time?
[2:52:32] <stratrat13> so dont comission for girl skeletons they are more expensice

[2:52:58] <%MooseIsGoose> Bomb em in his sleep
[2:52:59] <fairore> @jetstreamlove_R yeah the big ass elephant
[2:53:11] <Tomschiii> @otakon17 Not as fun as evading tho
[2:53:11] <otakon17> Paige is acclimating quite nicely
[2:53:13] <%kyh9> Just a little too excited about animal cruelty
[2:53:14] <otakon17> ANGRY BIRD again
[2:53:29] <+Pachi3000> "MATERIALS, YAAY" limesKnife
[2:53:34] <otakon17> @Tomschiii true but evading is riskier and requires better timing

[2:54:49] <%Cozy90> yeah piss beating!!
[2:54:50] <%Sotetsu> Does Rise have a story?
[2:54:50] <+OctaivianRex> GG
[2:55:06] <fairore> @Sotetsu yeah
[2:55:10] <otakon17> a slight story
[2:55:11] <TheRealNumberJ42> yes but nobody plays mh for the story
[2:55:13] <%echobee_tv> @echobee_tv Thank you!
[2:55:15] <%alphonseisbest> @Sotetsu YES, its mid
[2:55:18] <otakon17> the same one from 4 Ultimate
[2:55:20] <fairore> @Sotetsu but who cares
[2:55:21] <%TerpanderLux> moon2W
[2:55:23] <%KetsuoTaberu> lmao
[2:55:24] <%Sotetsu> @fairore Are they just ignoring it?
[2:55:27] <Ipsenscastle> there are some carves that are super tight
[2:55:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> Jhen, starting in 3
[2:55:30] <%TerpanderLux> man this series sucked
[2:55:31] <jetstreamlove_R> @Sotetsu Sort of in a way
[2:55:33] <$Artoo__The_Me> Perfectly timed carves
[2:55:34] <%cartakus> Dalamadur?
[2:55:36] <%Sotetsu> @fairore Yeah, I kind of wish it didnt
[2:55:38] <P4oloDiego> Lao Shang Lun on MH1 was impossible to get all carves on time
[2:55:38] <Profmcstevie> Dire Miralis experience
[2:55:39] <$Trenr> was that Jhen?
[2:55:41] <DusK_The_Stray> There was one in 3U, too
[2:55:41] <fairore> @Sotetsu yes
[2:55:47] <%Deft_Thought> World had the issue of the camera and death animation making it so you couldn't see where your character was
[2:55:49] <otakon17> basically the monsters are going crazy and attacking the village en masse like an army
[2:55:52] <jmepik> dalamadur
[2:55:54] <%Deft_Thought> And taking up 10 seconds
[2:55:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> Jhen , Dalamadur, Lao, etc.
[2:55:55] <%Jhylla81> Get all up in his guts
[2:55:57] <otakon17> THE MOUNTAIN SERPENT
[2:55:58] <Zombrocom> Ah yeah big snake boi
[2:56:00] <%echobee_tv> mud boy
[2:56:00] <$Trenr> oh yeah, forgot about him
[2:56:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> neutral stage 3 blue hammer fucks shit up
[2:56:01] <Lagzlot> Wasn't there a multi quest monster in Frontier that was so big it had a quest dedicated to just carving it?
[2:56:02] <Ner234> snek urgent
[2:56:02] <%dantejoestar21> there was also Lao Shen Long
[2:56:02] <DusK_The_Stray> 3U had Dire Miralis and Jhen Mohran and 4U had Dalamaladingdong
[2:56:03] <otakon17> LITERALLY the size of a mountain
[2:56:03] <%BubbaRands> Snek
[2:56:03] <%vehementvadr> long boi
[2:56:05] <+superchronicc> I watched a video where if you wirebug suspend in the air it skips the hunt ending animation and gets you to the hub even faster
[2:56:05] <fairore> theyre no need to really play the story
[2:56:07] <%BigCoffee> Why do monster names sound like pharmacy meds
[2:56:07] <Lynxystem> speaking of snakes i miss Najarala
[2:56:10] <%cartakus> He love dalamadur, he is beautiful
[2:56:11] <Profmcstevie> The snake coiled around a mountain
[2:56:13] <+SodiumPatrol> shadala was more of a pain somehow
[2:56:15] <thunderborn32> comically large even
[2:56:17] <jetstreamlove_R> Dalamadur AKA Orochimaru's pet
[2:56:26] <%RustyCoyoteA> Dalamadur is so fucking rough as a solo hunter
[2:56:27] <MystyTristy> i remember me and my friends had that hunt down for the best way to do it because i was getting super unlucky on drops
[2:56:27] <stratrat13> honestly my first big monster hunt was so bad from the world ps4 demo it made me watch tons of videos on weapons before it came out and im happy i did
[2:56:29] <@ssjklyco> I think Monhun might be easier for paige since unlike Dark Souls, most of the monsters share attack animations so it would be easier  for her to remember the patterns.
[2:56:38] <MystyTristy> something like 15 hunts without a single semi rare piece
[2:56:39] <DusK_The_Stray> Dire Miralis actually had just BARELY enough time to carve it all
[2:56:39] <otakon17> @BigCoffee Japanese to English romanization and translations; for instance Deviljho was called Eviljho in Japan
[2:56:56] <%cartakus> The dead Dalamadur in world is just peak eldritch horror of the ocean
[2:57:02] <otakon17> "Boot foot is tasty"
[2:57:02] <rasamune> Evil Joe >:3
[2:57:04] <jmepik> hah, I member when everyone called him jinouga
[2:57:12] <otakon17> the LAKES of acid
[2:57:13] <jmepik> instead of zinogre
[2:57:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Guys I never finished Mon Hun World. should I even bother getting this?
[2:57:21] <jmepik> weird names
[2:57:23] <DusK_The_Stray> Remember when crouching let you carve faster?
[2:57:31] <stratrat13> holy fuck pat you got all weapons?
[2:57:38] <otakon17> @TurtlesAndTentacles it's more of the same basically, did you get tired of World?
[2:57:39] <%Jhylla81> This is making me wanna play the Switch one
[2:57:39] <Ner234> Foot juice DansGame
[2:57:45] <stratrat13> bone bone scythe and guild?
[2:57:48] <%vehementvadr> but pat the switch axe meta
[2:57:49] <%azacca_bitter> lotion licker zangiefer
[2:57:49] <DusK_The_Stray> @TurtlesAndTentacles If you liked the gameplay, definitely. They're all self-contained
[2:57:50] <rasamune> I still think Naruga Curuga is better than Nargacuga
[2:57:50] <%cartakus> Rise is the smaller version of world so who knows
[2:57:50] <Angerest> manflesh
[2:57:55] <%BubbaRands> Mmmmmm foot
[2:58:00] <%SaiyanShoto> I saw if a dog licks your feet it’s cause their showing a sign of respect
[2:58:14] <otakon17> oh no
[2:58:17] <otakon17> you said the word
[2:58:20] <Jack_of_No_Trades> B O N E D O W N
[2:58:25] <jmepik> time to bone
[2:58:27] <DusK_The_Stray> Monster Bone Asses
[2:58:37] <stratrat13> wonder what plague is up to.  and hope his kitten bob is well
[2:58:38] <otakon17> gotta harvest from BONE ZONE
[2:58:43] <%YakumoYomi> B O N E D O W N
[2:58:56] <CrimsonGargoyle> B O N E T O W N
[2:59:00] <stratrat13> i think his kittens name was bob the one he showed on twitter
[2:59:01] <otakon17> Izuchi hammer is good upgrade, decent attack and Affinity
[2:59:05] <The_Mcmuffin> wishlist makes desire sensor worse
[2:59:13] <%Sotetsu> Is Rise or World a better place to start this series?
[2:59:14] <Ipsenscastle> is Pat on his switch file?
[2:59:20] <otakon17> it'll be fine
[2:59:24] <thunderborn32> izuchi makes a great lead up to narga weapons
[2:59:33] <stratrat13> rise at this point prob.
[2:59:37] <%cartakus> World has more tutorials kinda
[2:59:39] <Profmcstevie> Rise is a good start, in part because it's new so there's TONS of players discovering it too
[2:59:45] <otakon17> Fluffy Bunny Dango
[2:59:52] <Ipsenscastle> there's no way you're stronger than Gief
[2:59:53] <EDFscout> ...Are you faster?
[2:59:58] <sheepymcsheeperton> @sotetsu Either is fine
[2:59:59] <stratrat13> both are similar difference is wire bug one new mechanic @Sotetsu
[3:00:03] <otakon17> I do kinda miss the GIANT platter of meat and soup
[3:00:11] <+Thyzoon> @PatStaresAt You get locked into it if you wait too long to skip it
[3:00:12] <otakon17> weasel raptors
[3:00:13] <stratrat13> in rise
[3:00:16] <DusK_The_Stray> That one new mechanic does A LOT, though
[3:00:21] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I want to eat a dango when I play this game too long
[3:00:29] <otakon17> and the female ones are basically bikini's
[3:00:33] <thunderborn32> yeah, i think the hunter having sugar donuts EVERY meal is a bit much
[3:00:37] <%TerpanderLux> the female armor all look like trash
[3:00:42] <Coystick> Godbless bikini armour
[3:00:47] <Profmcstevie> My Elder Dragon.....bikinis
[3:00:48] <stratrat13> also its only on switch but also pc @Sotetsu
[3:00:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> gotta push button
[3:01:00] <%Jhylla81> Pat
[3:01:00] <%Dia_Dar> sexy female Uraagan
[3:01:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> Female Kirin and Nargacuga armors are sick
[3:01:01] <fairore> @TerpanderLux not all most
[3:01:02] <otakon17> I mean bikini armor is OKAY every once in a while but not all the time
[3:01:04] <%Sotetsu> @stratrat13 Wire bug looks pretty fun honeyg11Stress
[3:01:05] <TheRealNumberJ42> the guy that designs the female armor definitely has a thigh fetish
[3:01:12] <%cartakus> In my opinion m9st armors in b9th genders are more of a miss than a hit
[3:01:14] <%Jhylla81> Looking like Bobby Hill in Naruto world
[3:01:16] <%Zundelle> female armor designer tried desperately to put visible thighs on every armor set
[3:01:21] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS
[3:01:22] <%zarkazeon> Paige is a natural. once you make your first set you will be a full fledged hunter clad in the remains of your foes
[3:01:23] <+ocelotshotfirst> Just remember lol
[3:01:25] <otakon17> I think you can only check the small monster spots
[3:01:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's in the menu :)
[3:01:30] <+OctaivianRex> @TheRealNumberJ42 The man refuses to give women pants.
[3:01:38] <otakon17> like the orange dots are small mosnters
[3:01:38] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:40] <thunderborn32> there are ALWAYS 3 up the main path and climb the vines
[3:01:42] <%mai_waifu_> Gottem LUL
[3:01:43] <+Prinny_Raider> No I was trying to the same but I couldn't figure it out
[3:01:46] <%oda_flobunaga> Learn how to Google
[3:01:47] <%SaiyanShoto> I couldn’t figure it out so I just went by memory to find them
[3:01:57] <sheepymcsheeperton> Some of the male armor is sexy too
[3:01:59] <stratrat13> its pretty awesome for dodging and the redicuously anime attacks you do with em i think gunlance has the best wire bug move visually.
[3:02:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> google it!
[3:02:03] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I love the bomb badgers
[3:02:06] <Lagzlot> Oh boy, it looks like the king of the skies is hanging out in this expedition.
[3:02:09] <stratrat13> @Sotetsu
[3:02:11] <+ocelotshotfirst> They only show up on the map if you are on a quest to Hunt X Small Monsters.
[3:02:12] <otakon17> so you need to find some BONE ZONES
[3:02:16] <%BadDogNoBiscuits74> PLAGUE
[3:02:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> in game monhun maps seem to not be too helpful
[3:02:27] <otakon17> >Rathalos is here in a LR
[3:02:28] <Abyssal_Jaguar> hunter notes?
[3:02:31] <fairore> the female armor in 4u has some good ones
[3:02:34] <otakon17> KILL IT!
[3:02:36] <%TerpanderLux> its funny that world would tell you where the small monsters are at but not this game
[3:02:37] <%YakumoYomi> Ya'll gonna kill that Rathalos?
[3:02:46] <otakon17> the map in World was SUPER helpful
[3:02:50] <galko_chan1> the map not telling you where they are is such bullshit
[3:02:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> I want to see Paige try to kill the flying bugs with the hammer
[3:02:52] <otakon17> there's a semi lock on system
[3:02:56] <%TerpanderLux> its booty cheeks
[3:03:10] <stratrat13> in world i think the map would show gathering points but i couldnt find a setting for it in rise @PlagueOfGripes
[3:03:19] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> man I miss the scoutflies. could just pin anything on the map shadowchanPop
[3:03:21] <yukichocomilk> i haven't been able to lock on in this version
[3:03:24] <+OctaivianRex> Drop your weapon Paige.
[3:03:26] <thunderborn32> its cause she had her weapon out
[3:03:29] <+chiazam> material girl
[3:03:30] <DusK_The_Stray> You could hit the flashbug or you can put away your weapon and do it with a button
[3:03:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> gotta get bone
[3:03:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> you have to tab over using RB and LB to find resource nodes
[3:03:43] <%TerpanderLux> oh no its spider man time
[3:03:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> it won't list certain things though
[3:03:53] <otakon17> she's got it!
[3:03:58] <$Artoo__The_Me> Is pat playin with mods cuz of switch or nah
[3:03:59] <BigYanno> BONE!? How DARE you detective Diaz I am your SUPERIOR OFFICER!
[3:04:03] <+OctaivianRex> @yukichocomilk Switch to the other lock-on camera option. Focus cam I think. Only affects the camera though. Not your character.
[3:04:06] <stratrat13> in the map in your hud or the one in your menu?
[3:04:08] <%TerpanderLux> you have to hold the run button
[3:04:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> have to hold sprint
[3:04:10] <Darthkitten_Prime> Hold it down
[3:04:12] <whimwhisp> hold the run button
[3:04:13] <+ocelotshotfirst> Gotta sprint
[3:04:14] <otakon17> yeah it'll just list the small monsters on the map but not show you which is what
[3:04:16] <thunderborn32> sprint
[3:04:25] <stratrat13> oh just saw that plague
[3:04:32] <DaKnightWarrior> Can't wait for more Sunbreak news.
[3:04:34] <stratrat13> yeah world i think does
[3:04:35] <%TerpanderLux> you have to place them
[3:04:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> juulbug
[3:04:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> she hasnt placed it @PatStaresAt
[3:04:40] <Jack_of_No_Trades> She probably has to place one
[3:04:47] <stratrat13> but thats it i beleive
[3:04:49] <stratrat13> was nice
[3:04:56] <otakon17> she can't get the Great Wirebug yet
[3:05:02] <%TerpanderLux> you get some from some npc in the village
[3:05:04] <+OctaivianRex> She dosen't have any big bugs yet.
[3:05:07] <otakon17> that was a trap
[3:05:15] <$Artoo__The_Me> She has to talk to that one npc in the village by the bridge
[3:05:20] <otakon17> 'How DARE you have fun!"
[3:05:24] <%TerpanderLux> zangief would like one fun
[3:05:25] <stratrat13> can i get kisses?
[3:05:41] <otakon17> Bonepiles are MUY importante

[3:05:44] <Pookiedaexzile> No
[3:05:45] <%TerpanderLux> ew! yuck!

[3:06:28] <stratrat13> !recieves blindness from kisses!
[3:06:30] <otakon17> Hammer Bros!
[3:06:37] <+OctaivianRex> @stratrat13 limesLUL
[3:06:45] <TheeRabbi> Sounds hot
[3:06:56] <otakon17> Plants are usually for ammo for the Bowguns
[3:06:58] <stratrat13> contracts would be a better strat
[3:07:07] <%TerpanderLux> its fun to pick up leaves and twigs
[3:07:08] <%Sotetsu> Maybe Pat's feet are delicious
[3:07:09] <Profmcstevie> The non hunting of Monster Hunter is VERY relaxing
[3:07:09] <stratrat13> herb potion
[3:07:11] <DaKnightWarrior> Gathering is fun.
[3:07:12] <fairore> god i miss my buddys

[3:07:33] <CptHarlok> @otakon17 Yeah, a friend's dog basically chewed the fucking wooden door frame off while he was gone for a weekend.
[3:07:35] <%TerpanderLux> brown
[3:07:40] <+OctaivianRex> That's Rathalos.
[3:07:41] <Profmcstevie> I would go to the Deserted Island in 3U and spend like 20 minutes harvesting stuff with cha-cha
[3:07:47] <%JenovasPuppet> No it's purple
[3:07:50] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Or do and find out
[3:07:55] <+demonsamura> it is brown

[3:08:18] <%BadDogNoBiscuits74> Rathian

[3:08:43] <$Artoo__The_Me> It’s that but green and hairy
[3:08:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt how do you like your blue dog armor Pat?
[3:08:52] <stratrat13> you guys think paige secretly likes me? this being the first time shes ever acknowledged me on stream? :D
[3:08:56] <+OctaivianRex> More might have spawned in near the entrance by now.
[3:08:57] <otakon17> Rathalos is the first real WALL for any fledging Hunter
[3:09:03] <stratrat13> twice!
[3:09:06] <stratrat13> lol
[3:09:11] <%BadDogNoBiscuits74> Mine was Tigrex

[3:12:40] <Pookiedaexzile> You win this time small man
[3:12:40] <stratrat13> easy going fiver from world is the best waifu of all of monster hunter
[3:12:48] <otakon17> don't the blacksmith give you the option to equip stuff after forging it?
[3:12:49] <+ScrapKingKeita> bone weapons traded off sharpness for power
[3:12:53] <%TerpanderLux> ok :)
[3:12:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> bohn hamber
[3:12:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Gief will be back stronger
[3:12:56] <otakon17> Guildmarm <3
[3:12:57] <Profmcstevie> The split between bone path or ore
[3:12:58] <+OctaivianRex> Bone Hammer has less sharpness I think. That's the tradeoff.
[3:13:05] <thunderborn32> its sharpness will be worse later, but this low all sharpness sucks
[3:13:09] <BigYanno> Did Pat just Crazy talk Paige a better weapon?
[3:13:11] <fairore> @otakon17 yes
[3:13:12] <stratrat13> i will fight you in the street over easy going fiver from world

[3:13:37] <+thatoneheckla> egg boi
[3:13:37] <%Criotos> bird up
[3:13:37] <otakon17> Imean like I said, Sharpness doesn't matter THAT much with Hammers due to Charge moves ignoring Deflect and unless you're going from Yellow to Red the damage reduction isn't that high
[3:13:39] <tigerfang86> BIRD UP
[3:13:39] <thunderborn32> fast travel!
[3:13:40] <Profmcstevie> BIRD UP

[3:14:00] <+PrimalDweeb> Bird up!
[3:14:00] <%HarmonicArsenal> BIRD UP ironmousePop
[3:14:00] <%hotcarl6872> BIRD UP
[3:14:01] <%Sotetsu> The last time Pat and Paige enjoyed a game together, I bought Outriders. So I'm a little hesitant to buy this.
[3:14:02] <rasamune> Welcome to Bird Up, the worst fight in Monster Hunter
[3:14:02] <%Dia_Dar> BIRD UP
[3:14:04] <%Faustgesicht> BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD UP
[3:14:04] <+thatoneheckla> egg boi

[3:14:10] <otakon17> oh wait did the Kulu Ya-Ku make it to Rise?!
[3:14:10] <stratrat13> christopher columbus mode!
[3:14:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> bonk that jar
[3:14:14] <CrimsonGargoyle> LMFAO IT DOES @Sunstalker
[3:14:21] <otakon17> you fighting the Rock Chicken!
[3:14:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> he just wants to love his rock
[3:14:25] <%tank7013> I miss Yian Kut-Ku
[3:14:26] <%Dakuu75> remember that time in world, when he stole a fucking Final Fantasy Crystal? lol
[3:14:27] <%dekkitout> And his friend is a stupid rock
[3:14:28] <Darthkitten_Prime> Technically pretty smart since it uses tools
[3:14:30] <+Prinny_Raider> kulu yaku in that ff14 cross over was kidna funny
[3:14:31] <DaKnightWarrior> He's so cute
[3:14:31] <CptHarlok> I don't like ANY of the bird wyverns but I don't like him the least.
[3:14:31] <$Artoo__The_Me> He’s non hun world’s comedic monster
[3:14:32] <otakon17> let him love his rock
[3:14:32] <+OctaivianRex> @Sotetsu This isn't sponsored and Pat's loved Monster Hunter for years.
[3:14:33] <%blastyoboots> "abject moron" who can use tools
[3:14:36] <DejaraUndead> Kulu-ya-ku is the crack-head of MH
[3:14:40] <CorpulentToad> What does Pat think of Rise in comparison to world?
[3:14:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> then we knock him out and eat his insides like a pack of lions and let his rock erode in the hot sun
[3:14:46] <rasamune> @Dakuu75 what a dumb bitch
[3:14:54] <otakon17> I always found the Dodogama the goofiest
[3:14:54] <$Artoo__The_Me> Maybe it return in sun break??
[3:14:56] <thunderborn32> @blastyoboots but can't keep hold of them
[3:14:56] <+OctaivianRex> It's at the umbrella table I think
[3:14:57] <tigerfang86> Kulu just wanna ponder his orb
[3:14:59] <sheepymcsheeperton> Kulu is a good birb he steals rocks
[3:15:00] <%Sotetsu> @octaivianrex That's true.
[3:15:07] <whimwhisp> the areas are a little drab though~
[3:15:11] <%KnightOfTrousers> The music reminds me a bit of the Nier Auto soundtrack
[3:15:12] <+thatoneheckla> @patstaresat is there any monster you really want to come to rise?
[3:15:12] <whimwhisp> that's my one complaint
[3:15:14] <Profmcstevie> "japan" is a strong aesthetic as well
[3:15:17] <otakon17> LET'S DO THIS THING
[3:15:18] <whimwhisp> I like it more  over all but yeah
[3:15:19] <+demonsamura> what about complaints about rise being too easy?
[3:15:20] <stratrat13> no we take the rock and make barroth armor with it @PlagueOfGripes
[3:15:21] <+Mrbaconator> the only crime monster hunter commits as a series is not having a fist type weapon
[3:15:21] <+Acrylick42> is there any reason to buy this again
[3:15:21] <diontmack> rise is mahvel hunter
[3:15:23] <Vertigheist> wish it had more content like world but that's what's sunbreak's for
[3:15:24] <GoloThunder> worth on pc, if got for switch?
[3:15:28] <DaKnightWarrior> Monster must die!
[3:15:38] <greenoni> BIRD UP
[3:15:43] <%Cozy90> feels easier to play with friends
[3:15:57] <hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt is she getting use to it?
[3:16:02] <sheepymcsheeperton> World had better end game, apexes really need gear
[3:16:05] <otakon17> @GoloThunder do you have a beefy PC? the graphics get a major upgrade and if you really like the game double dipping could be worth it
[3:16:05] <Ape_Law> no cross save, so its up to you if you wanna do everything again
[3:16:05] <%TerpanderLux> it is a people shortchut
[3:16:07] <Zeif00> Couples outfits <3
[3:16:07] <%TerpanderLux> cut
[3:16:14] <stratrat13> or a lovely kulu yaku rock bowl thats just to precious to let the fucking thing live
[3:16:21] <otakon17> No fight the burr
[3:16:31] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I like her spunk
[3:16:31] <otakon17> she's BLOODTHRISTY
[3:16:35] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[3:16:35] <otakon17> she DOES scare me
[3:16:36] <yukichocomilk> another good reason to buy pc is the mods that will come out
[3:16:40] <CrimsonGargoyle> Peach's character sounds so much like her LUL
[3:16:41] <%BigCoffee> BLOODTHIRSTY PAIGE
[3:16:41] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[3:16:41] <otakon17> it's too much spunk
[3:16:41] <BackflipCharm> She was encouraging the Arzuros to do his best
[3:16:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> hey fuck you you stupid bear!
[3:16:47] <Profmcstevie> She says that at the grocery store too
[3:16:48] <otakon17> THERE HE IS
[3:16:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> 😡
[3:16:50] <tigerfang86> There he is
[3:16:50] <sheepymcsheeperton> She IS Paige
[3:16:51] <akitanito> sounds normal
[3:16:51] <otakon17> BIRD UP!
[3:16:53] <%FacetiousAF> AND WE POG
[3:16:53] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[3:16:53] <+FingaLights> Very Paige like
[3:17:01] <%FacetiousAF> fuck him up
[3:17:02] <SubjectX07x> It's just a hyper aggressive form of tourettes.
[3:17:03] <%raggedwharfrat> He a good chicken
[3:17:04] <otakon17> he is basically a chicken
[3:17:04] <+OctaivianRex> It's a chicken.
[3:17:04] <+FingaLights> Art imitates life
[3:17:06] <kazadog> eggy boy peepoHappy

[3:17:19] <$Trenr> needs more Yian Kut-ku
[3:17:19] <otakon17> AND NOW HE HAS THE ROCK!
[3:17:20] <CorpulentToad> And you can turn his hide into mad swag :)
[3:17:20] <%Nekros4442> Kulu teachs hammer users how to bully
[3:17:20] <TigerClaws12> ROCK D:
[3:17:22] <%TerpanderLux> 🪨
[3:17:22] <%barrakuta371> cool like you, what a weird monster name
[3:17:23] <Ner234> The RCK
[3:17:23] <$Wisconsinite> not the rock!
[3:17:24] <otakon17> he will SMACK you with it
[3:17:28] <%twoto858> BIRD UP
[3:17:29] <%hotcarl6872> Look out for the ROCK
[3:17:30] <%Valdorick> BIRD UP
[3:17:31] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Holding a rock = kicking your butt
[3:17:32] <otakon17> AND SHE BOUNCED OFF THE ROCK
[3:17:35] <diontmack> "GO TO HELL!" I scream as i get a package in the mail
[3:17:36] <DaKnightWarrior> Rock yo world!
[3:17:36] <+geeceevee45> SIR drop the ROCK monkaS
[3:17:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[3:17:37] <otakon17> he uses it as a SHIELD and a WEAPON
[3:17:41] <Oxybe> BIRD UP
[3:17:43] <wakemeup244> BIRD UP
[3:17:44] <DusK_The_Stray> That was especially true in World
[3:17:48] <Lagzlot> Contemplating that rock.
[3:17:49] <%Valdorick> Rok Protecc AND Attac!
[3:17:49] <%dekkitout> HE'S GOT A ROCK zimeSnexas
[3:17:51] <TheeRabbi> So basically, you guys are assholes and eventually the later monsters are just tired of your shit and attack you for slaughtering all their friends.
[3:17:52] <DusK_The_Stray> Like the elder dragons just straight up ignoring you
[3:17:52] <CorpulentToad> @Valdorick PAH-PAH-PAAAH-PAAAAAAAH
[3:18:01] <$sleepystardewfarmer> coming in with the steel chair
[3:18:04] <stratrat13> yeah him holding a rock is basically the gwyn phase of soul of cinder
[3:18:05] <jetstreamlove_R> he is a warrior of Light after all
[3:18:09] <+OctaivianRex> You'll notice that with the new armor Paige is now much more durable.
[3:18:09] <hakumaribo> BIG HAMMER STRONG
[3:18:13] <otakon17> @TheeRabbi I mean KINDA?
[3:18:16] <otakon17> also he PECC
[3:18:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> @TheeRabbi nah, pretty much every mission mentions that the monster you're sent to kill has been attacking travellers or something
[3:18:25] <thunderborn32> the wording of them using the same skeleton has terrible implications
[3:18:28] <otakon17> this fight theme is really energetic
[3:18:29] <%tank7013> @TheeRabbi No those ones are just assholes
[3:18:38] <otakon17> and you can even KNOCK THE ROCK OUT
[3:18:40] <+Acrylick42> Hammer smash
[3:18:41] <akitanito> hammer stronk
[3:18:43] <otakon17> but you gotta do the BIG hit
[3:18:44] <%BigCoffee> Kulu should be a wee bit smarter and pick up discarded hunter weapons
[3:18:46] <%Criotos> Early monsters are minor threats to town, late monsters are big threats to environments
[3:18:48] <%JenovasPuppet> You gotta SMASH that rock before the rock smashes you!
[3:18:49] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Kulu Ya-Ku is a mischievous one
[3:18:51] <Profmcstevie> Hammer privilege, fuck rocks
[3:19:01] <SivSarcast> Hey Pat how's it goin'
[3:19:05] <stratrat13> who cares if theyre just living their lives???? they make amazing hats AND pants
[3:19:07] <$sleepystardewfarmer> so he's intelligent enough to use tools
[3:19:08] <ArmadaGeddra> Can also flash it to make it drop the rock
[3:19:09] <otakon17> @BigCoffee they don't have the dexterity for it, with only three claws
[3:19:10] <InuOblivion> Damn this soundtrack is so anime
[3:19:11] <kazadog> @BigCoffee having a kulu variant that can do that would be sick
[3:19:24] <$Trenr> omg you know who needs to make a return? Qurupeco
[3:19:26] <%raggedwharfrat> I want a Kulu variant that learned how to use an SnS
[3:19:30] <%RetroCop87> ... is that a Kulu ya-ku?
[3:19:34] <Mattais88> I lovw that birb
[3:19:36] <DusK_The_Stray> "Defenseless"
[3:19:39] <GilliamYaeger> BIRD UP
[3:19:40] <Ner234> HELL YEAH
[3:19:41] <Sunstalker> It is not defenseless
[3:19:43] <+OctaivianRex> YEAH
[3:19:44] <yukichocomilk> he's ugly though, so he deserves it
[3:19:48] <thunderborn32> oh yeah, remember 4 people eating the same wiggly
[3:19:48] <InuOblivion> BIRD UP
[3:19:48] <otakon17> Paige has not fought the CRYSTAL KULU in World
[3:19:49] <%Sotetsu> Poor animuls
[3:19:51] <kazadog> @Trenr gimme the honk bird
[3:19:52] <%JenovasPuppet> It's harming the environment by being alive
[3:19:53] <DaKnightWarrior> Fuck that bitch for being a animal.
[3:19:54] <sheepymcsheeperton> He stole a ROCK
[3:20:04] <+FingaLights> We must hunt, for the ECOSYSTEM
[3:20:06] <valstriam> totally invasive, trust us
[3:20:08] <otakon17> he's GOT A ROCK!
[3:20:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> does paige know how to use silkstring attacks?
[3:20:16] <otakon17> at least it's not Titty Kicker
[3:20:18] <fairore> @yukichocomilk what heck WutFace
[3:20:20] <stratrat13> making christopher columbus proud everyday mh is
[3:20:22] <ArmadaGeddra> The rock will fuck you up if you dont respect it
[3:20:25] <%notsoy> THIS IS THE END
[3:20:31] <TheeRabbi> This game is the most human thing--intrude on land and kill everything that is there, claiming it's resp;onse to you instruding is aggression and justification for youi killing it
[3:20:33] <+skm742> According to mission summary, you're currently here because 'Kamura's No. 1 Egg Lover' is angry because Kulu stole his Gold Gargwa Egg, and he wants to show Kulu that he's number one.
[3:20:40] <+thatoneheckla> cut that tail off
[3:20:42] <hakumaribo> YOOOO Paige fucking him up!!!!
[3:20:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> (Paige is unimpressed and unsure what Pat did)
[3:20:51] <Profmcstevie> Longswording your wife to be and ruining her charges I see
[3:20:59] <%YakumoYomi> ここまでだ！
[3:21:00] <+Acrylick42> peach smash
[3:21:01] <otakon17> KEEP HITTING THAT HEAD PAIGE!
[3:21:02] <stratrat13> knock out!
[3:21:04] <%Sotetsu> @plagueofgripes That's the game
[3:21:05] <jetstreamlove_R> Kulu's tail can't be cut off
[3:21:08] <otakon17> DO THE NOVA!
[3:21:09] <stratrat13> good job paige

[3:21:28] <%kyh9> She's really getting into it
[3:21:37] <+thatoneheckla> i forgot
[3:21:40] <%BestTeaMaker> becareful
[3:21:40] <otakon17> yeah the leap you need to dive to the sides not backwards
[3:21:40] <stratrat13> you caused that knock down paige from your hammer you knocked him out
[3:21:43] <%Nekros4442> Feel like Kula would die bvefore the tail comes off anyway
[3:21:43] <%bustawof> bustawof subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[3:21:45] <%TerpanderLux> did longsword always eat through sharpness like that? i never really played it
[3:21:45] <DaKnightWarrior> The music as always in MH is Top Tier.

[3:22:13] <otakon17> man, whiffing with a GS is the worst feeling
[3:22:23] <DusK_The_Stray> You can fuck up his hands, too
[3:22:23] <otakon17> you can break his claws and legs too I thought?
[3:22:28] <Darthkitten_Prime> I think you can break the arms too?
[3:22:29] <SuperGoblinPunch> Hand frills too
[3:22:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> but what a face it is
[3:22:34] <%Mtome> psaBig whiffs
[3:22:45] <otakon17> the POWER of ROCK!
[3:22:51] <DejaraUndead> Cant stop the rock
[3:22:52] <otakon17> he must ponder it
[3:22:55] <therefortomorrow> Pat you should ride palamute when you whetstone so you can be mobile and not be stationary and get hit
[3:22:57] <+Crippl3> you can't chop a kulu tail?
[3:23:00] <$sleepystardewfarmer> tfw you're just minding your business and two people and their dogs carrying little knives in their mouths come and start beating you up
[3:23:02] <thunderborn32> wow paige is ALREADY using 2nd charge to reposition
[3:23:03] <%raggedwharfrat> Look at that boi go
[3:23:07] <otakon17> "Screw you guys! I'm going home!"
[3:23:12] <DusK_The_Stray> No, not the tail, but you can break the head and hands
[3:23:12] <%Deft_Thought> Let Kulu ponder his 🔮
[3:23:12] <jetstreamlove_R> making him drop the rock also gives shinies
[3:23:14] <otakon17> yeah for some reason you cannot chop off the Kulu tail
[3:23:15] <+Acrylick42> sharpen and drink on the dogs
[3:23:15] <%FacetiousAF> I'LL FUCKIN TRY
[3:23:17] <otakon17> no idea why
[3:23:18] <stratrat13> paige knocked it out
[3:23:20] <hakumaribo> Props on that KO Paige
[3:23:23] <CptHarlok> Only break head.
[3:23:29] <MageValerie> SHE BIG AND STONK LIKE HAMMER
[3:23:31] <%kyh9> Hammer is very good in this game too
[3:23:33] <%Nekros4442> BIG BONKS FOR DAYS
[3:23:35] <MageValerie> STRONK*
[3:23:36] <Vertigheist> you can't chop small bird wyvern tails in general
[3:23:37] <%Nekros4442> SHE'S ONE OF US
[3:23:38] <%RetroCop87> the hammer is all about aiming where the monster WILL be
[3:23:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> Magnamalo was... a hurdle
[3:23:43] <%Jhylla81> Looks like a cross between a raptor and a dodo
[3:23:43] <otakon17> Hammer is very good in World too
[3:23:44] <Profmcstevie> Congrats there's what....14 weapon types with varying flavours
[3:23:47] <InuOblivion> Paige like to bonk
[3:23:49] <+Acrylick42> the hammer is simple but stronk
[3:23:49] <+OctaivianRex> Most of the raptor type monster can't have their tails cut.
[3:23:56] <+thatoneheckla> paige might like switch blade
[3:23:57] <otakon17> in the demo, with crappy tier 1 weapons and armor
[3:24:03] <+Acrylick42> girls tend to like the bonk
[3:24:04] <kazadog> giefy do a bork
[3:24:06] <%Mtome> Magnamalo is so much fun to fight, his attacks are all so cool looking.
[3:24:08] <%Dakuu75> I think he did one, where he hit a large monster int he nuts as it wiffed him, right?
[3:24:08] <otakon17> he was overtuned like Nergi was in the World demo
[3:24:08] <CptHarlok> She's doing better than me with hammer, I can never get the range down muscle-memory wise.
[3:24:09] <yukichocomilk> sunhi legend is crazy
[3:24:09] <+PrimalDweeb> She does
[3:24:09] <Ner234> "Yoink" LUL
[3:24:16] <otakon17> love me a good bonkin'
[3:24:17] <%Blank9> all weapons are too cool in this
[3:24:21] <$Artoo__The_Me> But you can break Maccao’s tail
[3:24:30] <InuOblivion> Bonk is good bonk is life
[3:24:30] <stratrat13> god i wish i could get more moments like sunhli.  i wonder if he has multiple people getting gifs or if its just him
[3:24:31] <hakumaribo> SHES IN
[3:24:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> D:
[3:24:35] <%cade_calrayn> She gets it
[3:24:38] <jetstreamlove_R> Magnamalo is just a show off like Zinogre, it's just flare. Though I'm glad they made Zinogre more of a threat in this game
[3:24:39] <EDFscout> you ARE the rock!
[3:24:40] <RogueMinja> Gonna smash into that desire sensor wall at some point.
[3:24:40] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt but how can i enjoy the game if i dont own 10,000 mega potions so i never have to think about it
[3:24:42] <%cade_calrayn> She understands the power of BIRD UP
[3:24:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> BREAK PAT
[3:25:00] <Profmcstevie> Sever pats orb!
[3:25:04] <otakon17> did Pats dog just hit it with a parasol?!
[3:25:05] <Darthkitten_Prime> Just out of curiosity since I wasn't here for the whole thing, did she express any interest in checking out other weapons?
[3:25:06] <EDFscout> [Pats broken]
[3:25:08] <+Acrylick42> she should spend most of the time in hammer in blue, then switch to yellow for a quick slam attack
[3:25:09] <kazadog> helm splitter is really generous in rise huh
[3:25:19] <+OctaivianRex> Nice.
[3:25:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat is also using the parasol
[3:25:28] <thunderborn32> @otakon17 the parasol doubles as a shield for blocking attacks
[3:25:30] <%Jhylla81> ...I got a rock
[3:25:31] <otakon17> yeah Helm Splitter was super generous in World too
[3:25:45] <+PrimalDweeb> Bird up is all about asserting your dominance, which Paige excels at.
[3:25:45] <nomnombear64> chicken hold rock really good
[3:25:48] <jetstreamlove_R> nah Helm splitter can still be buggy, unless they finally patch it up
[3:25:51] <otakon17> HAHAHA
[3:25:54] <@SoFarFetched> BIRD UP geefSnap
[3:25:55] <fairore> woooooo
[3:25:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> he needs to get a rock before he gets trapped
[3:26:00] <DaKnightWarrior> SeemsGood
[3:26:01] <stratrat13> how do you helm splitter in rise?  ik how to do the jump kick wire bug moce
[3:26:03] <stratrat13> move
[3:26:06] <%Treuan> More like BIRD DOWN haha aha
[3:26:10] <%codedoomboy> She will definitely do really good with sword and shield
[3:26:13] <%JenovasPuppet> Paige chooses VIOLENCE
[3:26:17] <otakon17> you can't harvest caps
[3:26:21] <Manooz> also more rewards + some rewards are higher chance with capture
[3:26:22] <hakumaribo> dude shes totally in
[3:26:24] <+Acrylick42> the early game doesn't matter but sometimes you want to kill not capture depending on the parts you're after
[3:26:24] <+PrimalDweeb> GG
[3:26:24] <akitanito> don't vivisect that living animal paige
[3:26:26] <$scallycap> "how do i carve a living animal?"
[3:26:27] <otakon17> Paige wanted MORE violence
[3:26:28] <+FingaLights> She wants to harvest it ALIVE
[3:26:29] <Manooz> like fuckin GEMS YOU PIECE OF SHIT DROP YOUR GEM
[3:26:38] <DusK_The_Stray> This quest reward screen tells you exactly what gave you the rewards, like you got this feather from breaking the head
[3:26:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat is proud of his purple and orange horse dog
[3:26:42] <Profmcstevie> She seeks MORE hammering and carving
[3:26:43] <CptHarlok> Cap/kill depends on what you want materials wise.
[3:26:46] <%kyh9> I can't wait to see Paige dealing with higher level monsters like MagnaMalo and Goss Harog and Diablos
[3:26:51] <Mortal_Wombat_I> Paige is honestly doing a great job
[3:26:52] <otakon17> YES
[3:26:57] <+thatoneheckla> paige seems like she's really enjoying the game
[3:27:01] <otakon17> NEVER hesitate on weapon ugrades to your fav weapon
[3:27:03] <+OctaivianRex> That was like 30 minutes faster.
[3:27:04] <%DeadStage> does paige know about STRENGTH CHARGE 3 IMPACT CRATER yet?
[3:27:05] <Darthkitten_Prime> @kyh9 I need to see her reaction to Bazel.
[3:27:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeh bigger number
[3:27:14] <+xBloodySin> LUL
[3:27:16] <hakumaribo> Bro i think the game loop has clicked for her
[3:27:19] <+FingaLights> I don't know what's happening, but Paige seems BIG and STRONG
[3:27:20] <Vertigheist> watch her wreck a rajang on first try like in bloodborne
[3:27:23] <stratrat13> orange and purple? wtf is pat trying to make an ugly dog?>
[3:27:29] <otakon17> sounds like the Arzuros Hammer
[3:27:35] <%Cozy90> does it have a bear arm on it
[3:27:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> I dare you to explain weapon paths
[3:27:36] <stratrat13> or fabulous?
[3:27:44] <DusK_The_Stray> Thanks, Teddy
[3:27:46] <+Acrylick42> i don't remember the hammer progression
[3:27:54] <otakon17> yeah but it has REALLY small sharpness
[3:27:54] <BackflipCharm> That sharpness is abysmal
[3:27:59] <kazadog> that fucking shrapness though jesus
[3:27:59] <$scallycap> that sharpness grade is dogshit lol
[3:28:07] <stratrat13> she may have it
[3:28:07] <$Stratiotai2> Stratiotai2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! Hello
[3:28:11] <Manooz> izuchi is probably better to stick with
[3:28:14] <otakon17> yeah I'd pass on it, the power is good but the sharpness is HORRID
[3:28:16] <Manooz> good sharpness/dmg/affinity
[3:28:18] <thunderborn32> look at all that red sharpness
[3:28:21] <SulfurousAcid> change your hammer paige
[3:28:30] <+Acrylick42> there's like no good sharpness in low rank is there?
[3:28:34] <stratrat13> its an upgrade path you had the original hammer i think paige
[3:28:34] <Lynxystem> she switched off her izuchi hammer
[3:28:41] <Manooz> Izuchi weps generally do
[3:28:42] <otakon17> since you'd drop from yellow to red like, IMMEDIATELY meaing you'd have to sharpen every few minutes
[3:28:43] <nomnombear64> nice
[3:28:43] <%TerpanderLux> get some ore... ore else....
[3:28:46] <kazadog> @Acrylick42 no but that hammer is particularly bad

[3:37:33] <%Agami23> soaring wyvern blade
[3:37:33] <%raggedwharfrat> Depends on how you want to playu
[3:37:33] <%hotcarl6872> Soaring wyvern blade
[3:37:34] <%BigCoffee> SWB
[3:37:34] <%YakumoYomi> Soaring
[3:37:35] <%vehementvadr> soaring
[3:37:35] <Manooz> soaring
[3:37:37] <thunderborn32> soaring wyvern is hot
[3:37:37] <%GinAndRoses> soaring 4me
[3:37:37] <Shardlab> Wyvern Blade
[3:37:38] <Manooz> soaring 100%
[3:37:39] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Gambit, Soaring is ex to whiff
[3:37:41] <Zeif00> soaring
[3:37:42] <+imthewisejanitor> ligma
[3:37:43] <%Dakuu75> I only know the Long Sword options
[3:37:43] <BackflipCharm> Soaring Wyvern Blade combos with your zero distance impact
[3:37:45] <%Blank9> soaring 100%
[3:37:46] <+thatoneheckla> soaring
[3:37:46] <%Agami23> if you do elemental burst you can cancel the knockback into wyvern blade
[3:37:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> all I know is hammer time
[3:37:49] <Marhunter7> Soaring lets you do a follow up from zero sum discharge
[3:37:50] <%hotcarl6872> You can combo into it after the Zero Sum Discharge
[3:37:53] <+OctaivianRex> Soaring is cooler, Invincible is safer.
[3:37:54] <%Blank9> soaring can be done midair
[3:37:57] <%Jhylla81> That's terrible. I love it
[3:38:01] <thunderborn32> nothing like superman leaping into a discharge
[3:38:18] <+OctaivianRex> You can use Soaring after you get launched from a Zero Sum Discharge.
[3:38:23] <+FingaLights> She survived
[3:38:25] <%raggedwharfrat> Soaring doesn't have hyper armor, and is super susceptible to anything. But you can combo after the blowback from ZSD, avoiding the long recovery.
[3:38:29] <%Blank9> Soaring Wyvern is like a midair divekick, or an uppercut into divekick
[3:38:30] <%hotcarl6872> It explodes and you launch into the air, then you use Soaring Wyvern
[3:38:30] <%TerpanderLux> you can dye it????
[3:38:36] <%MidnightBurst12> oh god
[3:38:38] <%YakumoYomi> You get blasted off the monster after ZSD, and then you use Soaring
[3:38:38] <+PrimalDweeb> Yikes
[3:38:39] <TheRealNumberJ42> soaring after zsd is the coolest shit
[3:38:43] <@PlagueOfGripes> you can also make porn cat.
[3:38:45] <%Dakuu75> (kill me) lol
[3:38:46] <%TerpanderLux> YEEEEEEEAH

[3:39:10] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh that's actually kind of cute
[3:39:10] <%kyh9> FROM THE SONIC MOVIE, ITS TAILS
[3:39:11] <%cvp5127> get the sexy cat costume
[3:39:12] <%raggedwharfrat> The Gambit has hyper armor, has great mobility, and does okay damage. Careful if you decide to switch to compressed discharge, though, since it sends your teammates flying.
[3:39:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> Thats not too bad
[3:39:13] <Ghufufin> what better than splosion? double explosion
[3:39:14] <%barrakuta371> thats less bad
[3:39:17] <%VentWilsn> the headpiece no the giant tails YES
[3:39:25] <%greasypete00> why do sonic costumes always make things look vaguely sex pest-y
[3:39:26] <kingofgames726> i ilke the tales
[3:39:27] <stratrat13> I DIDNT KNOW TAILS DOG ARMOR! holy crap thats cool
[3:39:28] <+OctaivianRex> Dog costume is not as bad.
[3:39:30] <%skrewarrior> the thighs make it weird
[3:39:33] <DaKnightWarrior> Every RPG needs Layered armour
[3:39:34] <%kyh9> AKNOSOM

[3:41:49] <%Agami23> it turns into a blade that you charge
[3:41:51] <thunderborn32> bloodborne
[3:41:54] <stratrat13> its the sword and axe from bloodborne paige
[3:41:56] <+FingaLights> That's a bloodborne
[3:42:00] <%raggedwharfrat> Using that after getting blown away by ZSD combos into it.
[3:42:00] <Lynxystem> i would love to use the joke cooking weapons but only if we had a chef outfit to go with it, lol.
[3:42:01] <%TerpanderLux> @Monkeyweed21 i want FUNNIER weapons 😡

[3:42:34] <sheepymcsheeperton> Axe a nom
[3:42:38] <stratrat13> just something for paige to see and get excited about
[3:42:42] <+ScrapKingKeita> Switch Axe was 3U, which was late 2000s
[3:42:48] <%Monkeyweed21> mh3 in 2009
[3:42:48] <+ScrapKingKeita> err, Tri
[3:42:48] <$sleepystardewfarmer> I don't really understand the switch, it looks like they move at the same rate? does the sword version have a different move set?
[3:42:51] <Oxybe> Insect Glave crew represent!
[3:42:52] <%doomunderthestairs> loud and clear and precious
[3:42:55] <%hotcarl6872> Spam circle then hit triangle to make the phials charge faster
[3:42:58] <Marhunter7> Switch Axe play style: "go in never stop going in, always be going in! attack attack attack!"
[3:43:03] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt What's the fastest weapon?
[3:43:06] <+PrimalDweeb> Bird up!
[3:43:08] <%dekkitout> @Oxybe Je suis monte
[3:43:09] <%Cozy90> baby noises are content
[3:43:16] <+Acrylick42> i cant dodge a shout to save my life smh
[3:43:16] <stratrat13> honestly anytime a hunting horn user joined id get so excited it was pretty rare in world atleast
[3:43:21] <Profmcstevie> Fastest weapon is Dual blades, all offense
[3:43:27] <DaKnightWarrior> @havictos Duel Blades
[3:43:36] <%TerpanderLux> just like real life
[3:44:06] <%Blank9> insect glaive can be pretty fast too, especially for general mobility
[3:44:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> this umbrella bird is hard to read
[3:44:19] <rasamune> @stratrat13 Everyone loved Hunting Horns but no one wanted to run it for some reason
[3:44:23] <knight_verse> This bird with that dance... must be a Bluth.
[3:44:26] <Oxybe> @dekkitout je suis monte
[3:44:33] <+Havictos> @DaKnightWarrior I've never played monster hunter before are they good in Rise?
[3:44:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> a lot of the monsters I have trouble on will just be sitting there then a 5 frame attack just pops out that does half your hp
[3:44:44] <%dekkitout> Pardon 🥖
[3:44:45] <Marhunter7> Hunting Horn in rise is a blast, i know some people hate the changes but i love them
[3:45:10] <Oxybe> IG is surprisingly good at popping in and out of melee once you start playing with the switch skills
[3:45:18] <+RemedyofRevenge> switch axe and horn aremy favorites
[3:45:18] <Marhunter7> @PlagueOfGripes Yain Garuga is the WORST for that.
[3:45:26] <thunderborn32> @Marhunter7 its nice how getting a charge adds element to axe mode
[3:45:31] <Jack_of_No_Trades> "You look like you have huge guts!" -Paige's hunter
[3:45:37] <stratrat13> @rasamune i think its bc its the most complicated people say charge blade is but its very simple even i main charge blade but hh is just so odd to me
[3:45:42] <+FingaLights> Spoiled little pig boi
[3:45:43] <Lynxystem> Marhunter7 HH was my secondary in World and i always wanted just a touch more mobility, now i main it with Rise, lol. its perfect chwGasm
[3:45:49] <kinkade_77> sunbreak is going to be 50 bucks???
[3:45:53] <+Stormzcales_Lair> better than paijntballs
[3:45:54] <Mattais88> I love the HH, nothing better than eating an attack then healing it up a second later because regen+large heal
[3:46:04] <+Acrylick42> pokemon battle
[3:46:09] <%Monkeyweed21> dont forget to paintball the monster
[3:46:09] <Marhunter7> @thunderborn32 They made switch axe so nutty in rise its hilarious, if you can keep those attacks rolling it will rip monsters apart.
[3:46:12] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Awwww baby
[3:46:14] <+OctaivianRex> Give em the rough love.
[3:46:16] <+PrimalDweeb> That sounded like a legit baby. LUL
[3:46:23] <stratrat13> i loved when a hh user joined my party
[3:46:31] <Oxybe> Endgame Rampage HH with Jet Dragon armour is absolutely nuts
[3:46:35] <Jaysky> Hey chat how's Paige faring so far? She sounds like she's doing well
[3:46:40] <%dekkitout> Anyone know that Crash game where this was a mechanic
[3:46:43] <+Acrylick42> paige smash
[3:46:49] <$sleepystardewfarmer> he is distressed that his mom is in a different part of the house
[3:47:07] <stratrat13> what was a mechanic?

[3:47:22] <+bunchaghosts> warped i think
[3:47:23] <+OctaivianRex> Nice.
[3:47:24] <%VentWilsn> Crash of the Titans?
[3:47:25] <%Agami23> its so cool to combo zero sum discharge into soaring wyvern blade.
[3:47:36] <+RemedyofRevenge> ngl I love the game so far, but I skip nearly every cutscene and muted the character voice audio cause it makes me cringe so hard
[3:47:41] <krin_x> sa is so good in this game
[3:47:43] <%dekkitout> @VentWilsn Yeah that one
[3:47:46] <Darthkitten_Prime> It's so fucking good

[3:48:06] <+SinisterBroccoli> How is long sword in Rise?
[3:48:06] <susukouhai> @stratrat13 crash mounting on monsters back
[3:48:11] <Radioactivetaco9> @RemedyofRevenge you can play in monster hunter language so you cant understand the cringe
[3:48:12] <+FingaLights> @RemedyofRevenge but how will you know if they are getting started?
[3:48:14] <+RemedyofRevenge> I have changed the language, still hate it
[3:48:17] <%JenovasPuppet> Is that like Super Kulu-Ya-Ku?
[3:48:17] <cyclone722> remember you can switch to MH language if you don't want english or japanese
[3:48:20] <+ikantreeed> Paige getting the hang of it?
[3:48:27] <stratrat13> @RemedyofRevenge what language setting you on?
[3:48:31] <thunderborn32> too bad the skills are terrible, great for layered though
[3:48:32] <%VentWilsn> @VentWilsn ur either thinking of that one or MInd Over Mutant
[3:48:43] <+OctaivianRex> @JenovasPuppet It's like Yian-Kut-Ku but not ugly.
[3:48:46] <%blastyoboots> break their right wing
[3:48:48] <+RemedyofRevenge> Was on English, hated it. Swapped to Japanese, bearable but I still hate it
[3:48:51] <stratrat13> @susukouhai oh kingdom hearts.  get on the hydras back
[3:48:56] <%hotcarl6872> Use your other wirebug move to charge your sword gauge
[3:49:11] <rasamune> Honestly I think the reason I don't mind the Handler as much as everyone else seems to was that I played all of World in Hunterese
[3:49:14] <stratrat13> hmm im good with it but im not listening very hard
[3:49:28] <DaKnightWarrior> It's never too much!
[3:49:31] <+ikantreeed> Do y'all know if the matchmaking in this game any good?
[3:49:36] <+RemedyofRevenge> The rest of the game is fun and fine, just any of the dialogue is either bland or just makes me hate listening to it
[3:49:37] <+kevlarkoala> Pat using the swag axe, nice
[3:49:42] <Lynxystem> just bullying him, you gonna take his lunch money while yer at it?
[3:49:47] <stratrat13> i thought the handler from world was fine and cute
[3:49:54] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt How's performance and options?
[3:50:05] <+kevlarkoala> @ikantreeed the matchmaking? i mean...are you asking if noobs are going to ruin your hunt? because if so, just dont bother matchmaking
[3:50:09] <%KetsuoTaberu> you haven't mutilated ALL of the creature yet
[3:50:13] <%blastyoboots> Paige should still want to hammer the face to knock it out
[3:50:14] <%JenovasPuppet> "I'm BRINGING THE PAIGE!"
[3:50:16] <stratrat13> just needed to stay in camp not venture around in monster infested places
[3:50:19] <Idon__> "be carefu- BE CAREFUL"
[3:50:37] <fairore> @RemedyofRevenge you know you can change the voices and how much they talk
[3:50:55] <$sleepystardewfarmer> I feel like if you break literally every part on a monster, it should probably just die
[3:51:14] <+RemedyofRevenge> @RemedyofRevenge Yes I know, it muted it instantly and skip cutscenes
[3:51:31] <+OctaivianRex> Getting close already.
[3:51:36] <+PrimalDweeb> GG
[3:51:37] <stratrat13> in rise can hammer help get a tail to like the point it can be cut off or can only slicing damage like effect the tail at all for cutting it off
[3:51:39] <+FingaLights> Just break the monsters spirit, easiest way to kill them... On the inside @sleepystardewfarmer
[3:51:43] <%bustawof> I love the cheesy stupid dialogue give me all the cheese
[3:52:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> for the environment
[3:52:04] <@PlagueOfGripes> should ask Paige which buttons she is pushing
[3:52:12] <Marhunter7> The plot for MH games is always the most goofy BS, its great.
[3:52:17] <Lynxystem> stupid ass mario fireball chuckin ass bird
[3:52:20] <Profmcstevie> Paige has grown, she no longer cares for the creatures
[3:52:23] <+RemedyofRevenge> I appreciate if anyone likes the dialogue, but its just not for me. But if it gives others enjoyment thats good enough for me
[3:52:28] <+leviting> I mean, its hard to flee with broken wings
[3:52:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> lol bird fall down
[3:52:29] <%cade_calrayn> I love how Paige has already assumed Pat's "fuck em cause they're bitches" mindset
[3:52:33] <+OctaivianRex> @PlagueOfGripes The good ones, obviously.
[3:52:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> that bird is so tired of life
[3:52:40] <Marhunter7> And thats why its the best!
[3:52:41] <%JenovasPuppet> Can you cut off his tail?
[3:52:41] <stratrat13> remember pat sometimes rt becomes x or a for paige
[3:52:45] <%BlueLunecy> I miss the Caravaneer
[3:52:48] <+Acrylick42> better than world tbh
[3:52:49] <Vertigheist> it's kinda like fighting games
[3:52:49] <+RemedyofRevenge> Thanks Pat lol
[3:52:50] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt isn't it there a bad monster we need to beat it up?
[3:52:55] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt worse than Dragon's Dogma's
[3:52:56] <%dekkitout> But the bio-energy, or whatever
[3:52:57] <+OctaivianRex> It's the same plot they use every time.
[3:53:01] <+Crippl3> being sincere with it is a plus, in my book
[3:53:06] <%bustawof> @RemedyofRevenge I underrstand aslong as your enjoying the game
[3:53:07] <skyshinecrusader> Sounds like monster hunter
[3:53:09] <Mortal_Wombat_I> World had a pretty neat plot I felt like
[3:53:10] <%Cozy90> ive been mashing too much to read the story
[3:53:12] <%oda_flobunaga> ?
[3:53:13] <DaKnightWarrior> both the 5th gen story is bad.
[3:53:13] <thunderborn32> nice broke tail too
[3:53:14] <Profmcstevie> I liked 3Us story, "fucking earthquakes go kill it"
[3:53:24] <dmtjinni> Page
[3:53:27] <%JenovasPuppet> @oda_flobunaga Dragon's Dogma's story is alright, you shut your mouth!
[3:53:30] <Oxybe> It's a looooooove story Pat.
[3:53:39] <+Jack8274> I'm pretty sure you are the baddies
[3:53:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> monsters are weird oh an elder did it kill it - every story
[3:53:43] <%kyh9> Horizon Zero Dawn is "Monster Hunter With a Story"
[3:53:49] <DrkJP520> This is the first MH game where the humans actually get names, I believe
[3:53:54] <%oda_flobunaga> @JenovasPuppet I was legitimately asking
[3:53:57] <%KetsuoTaberu> nice
[3:53:58] <Marhunter7> MH:W IB plot: yo this weird dragon is causing other monsters to go nuts, go kill it!
[3:54:06] <TallYoda08> atpBird HEY WTF???
[3:54:07] <DaKnightWarrior> NICE SeemsGood
[3:54:08] <%cgreene64> God the Switch Axe is so cool
[3:54:08] <stratrat13> were not the ones hurting the ecosystem! this one mother fucking monster is!  we killed hundreds of the same thing how are they almost extinct>>>
[3:54:10] <SForlord> Looks like it runs good
[3:54:12] <stratrat13> ???
[3:54:16] <%oda_flobunaga> It seems to me that D Dogma is MonHun with good plot
[3:54:17] <%kyh9> I wish they'd bring back the scrapped story about the Ancient Civilization and Equal Dragon Weapon
[3:54:23] <%kyh9> TALK ABOUT THE EQUAL DRAGON WEAPON
[3:54:24] <+jackjackjackNcoke> monster hunter language pls
[3:54:25] <%GinAndRoses> yay materials!
[3:54:25] <%TheWinged7> it is easy cause you geared up AND got better paige
[3:54:26] <%kyh9> YOU COWARDS
[3:54:29] <+OctaivianRex> Better gear and practice helps a lot.
[3:54:32] <+Caidezes> Paige is really good at this.
[3:54:37] <vonmaultke> As long as I can skip the story i don't mind, the player character talking erks me much more
[3:54:39] <%kyh9> TALK ABOUT THE MAN MADE ABOMINATION BEYOND COMPREHENSION
[3:54:47] <InuOblivion> Peel it’s skin 3 times
[3:54:48] <+Havictos> Yo those dogs look fucking awesome!
[3:54:52] <+SilverDevilfish> Oh no a purple dog thing, kill it. Oh no a wind dagron, kill it. Oh no his wife, kill her. Oh no she ate him, kill her again.
[3:54:54] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Really great
[3:54:55] <Marhunter7> @kyh9 Isn't that still technically "cannon" because the art book stuff is considered the actual "lore" ?
[3:54:56] <%hotcarl6872> She's doing a great job
[3:54:57] <%JenovasPuppet> Bloodborne vet!
[3:54:59] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, peach did great.
[3:55:01] <$Artoo__The_Me> Yeah, talk about the concept art!
[3:55:01] <@Ranryu692> real question is, how much does she retain to the next play session
[3:55:05] <%Sotetsu> otzBlushA otzBlushA otzBlushA
[3:55:06] <Lynxystem> Paige is where i was after 3 MH games LUL
[3:55:07] <%kyh9> Can we get more MonHun streams from you guys?
[3:55:09] <%RustyCoyoteA> We are not home paige
[3:55:09] <sheepymcsheeperton> Big good job Paige
[3:55:11] <%bustawof> paige your dick is huge
[3:55:13] <yukichocomilk> paige is "poggers"
[3:55:14] <%RustyCoyoteA> Joking*
[3:55:19] <%greasypete00> pat always sounds a little sarcastic when he says sincere things
[3:55:20] <%Cozy90> you look like jack sparrow
[3:55:25] <%mai_waifu_> I'm blown away at how well she's doing
[3:55:29] <%kyh9> @kyh9 I hope so.  Because that stuff could be GENUINELY interesting
[3:55:30] <Profmcstevie> Damn paiges dick is almost as big as pats right now wowee
[3:55:30] <+ArsCaelia> good job paige!!
[3:55:30] <strangelee> I CAN believe that this is a person that completed Bloodborne
[3:55:31] <%XelanArdel> how does paige feel about the game now?
[3:55:37] <%RetroCop87> Pat is "preggers"
[3:55:44] <Slim_Lipid> @drkjp520 the final title update for Iceborne named one character, and confirmed that it was a returning character for the salty hand jobs upset at World LUL
[3:55:48] <BurningWigEmissary> paige: simply poggers
[3:55:48] <+FingaLights> ^
[3:55:50] <Darthkitten_Prime> I hope you guys play this again! I really like hearing her reactions.
[3:55:59] <+FingaLights> Poggers Paige, Preggers Pat
[3:56:00] <$Artoo__The_Me> Ak-no-som
[3:56:01] <%FacetiousAF> awww fuck next we have to talk BUILDS
[3:56:05] <%BigCoffee> Show Paige the Lagombi armor!
[3:56:07] <%barrakuta371> bird up armor
[3:56:07] <Marhunter7> @kyh9 I think it is though i cannot remember off hand if they've ever hard confirmed it. I remember one of the directors mention its cannon at one point but i would have to find a source.
[3:56:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> big number
[3:56:17] <stratrat13> the only gripe with bloodborne i have is that most enemies with a strength build all you gotta do to beat em is tap r1 over and over.
[3:56:18] <@Ranryu692> the Cock Knight
[3:56:19] <+Havictos> even low level armor looks good here
[3:56:30] <stratrat13> its my fav game of all time also
[3:56:31] <SulfurousAcid> number go up, the game
[3:56:53] <+Havictos> I don't have friends that like monster hunter
[3:56:57] <%kyh9> MORE MONHUN STREAMS

[3:57:02] <%TerpanderLux> when you have no friends you have no choice but to go solo

[3:57:15] <%cade_calrayn> I would absolutely watch more of Pat & Paige play more of this
[3:57:15] <+ArsCaelia> i can't be assed to pay for online so also loner
[3:57:17] <Marhunter7> At least you don't have to deal with the archaic BS from the early games.
[3:57:18] <SForlord> I'm gonna grab this next week. Can't wait to pick up the horn again.
[3:57:22] <+TestAnon> it's kinda nice to test out your skills solo

[3:58:11] <SchroedingersFerret> @trackles_64 fiance

[3:58:24] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat People on twitter are call out people playing rise gatekeepers, because someone mod rise to give them all items at max.
[3:58:31] <%Sotetsu> psaDogchamp "I'm full of piss!"
[3:58:48] <%hotcarl6872> I played through this and World/Iceborne by myself because none of my friends wanted to get into MH
[3:58:52] <+trackles_64> when is pat not full of piss?
[3:58:53] <%hotcarl6872> I still had a blast though
[3:58:59] <stratrat13> also you did awesome compared to me on my first hunts paige and i put 1500 hours into world but i didnt charge the greatsword on that first day lol
[3:59:14] <stratrat13> just tapped triangle

[3:59:51] <DaKnightWarrior> Got to go now. Great Stream!
[4:00:38] <+TestAnon> playing through it with my brother, having a blast with lance and gunlance
[4:02:02] <Marhunter7> Had a conversation with someone once where they said "they couldn't have made these games more confusing" ... all i could say was "you have NO IDEA, how much less confusing it is now"
[4:02:02] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:02:30] <Profmcstevie> Thats the current MH conversation, "OH BOY see now THAT was way worse 3 games ago...."
[4:02:50] <EynoStiles> @marhunter7 They wont get until they play one of the older titles like mh3u or even mhgu
[4:02:52] <Mattais88> I kind of want to go back to that pat/woolie world video now and see how different it was
[4:03:00] <Marhunter7> @Profmcstevie "at least YOU DON'T HAVE TO ATTACK WITH THE RIGHT STICK LIKE I DID!"
[4:03:13] <%cvp5127> shes in
[4:03:23] <+PrimalDweeb> Sounds good
[4:03:26] <%Sotetsu> Pat, you look very handsome today

[4:04:05] <Profmcstevie> Paige goes from "I dunno Paaat" to "YEAAH ADRIAN"
[4:04:09] <%Cozy90> Gagging on weiners
[4:04:13] <%Sotetsu> Yeah this was super fun

[4:05:11] <Marhunter7> So everyone, whats the over under on them putting plecsioth into sunbreak?
[4:05:16] <%hotcarl6872> That would have been a nightmare to explain
[4:05:20] <Profmcstevie> Item wheel and loadouts are all she needs now
[4:05:25] <whittacre> does Rise have a real farm again or is it a boring shop stall like world's?
[4:05:32] <+polothegreatest> woolieS woolieT

[4:06:56] <+FingaLights> Don't blame her
[4:06:57] <%FacetiousAF> she's always right to ignore you
[4:07:00] <Marhunter7> @Agami23 Switch axe instructions: attack, keep attacking, never stop attacking, press more buttons, do it now!

[4:08:23] <Profmcstevie> A baby SHOULD use a baby weapon for 1
[4:08:25] <%hotcarl6872> Play whatever is fun for you
[4:08:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> @kyh9 I feel like most people would want Teostra dead when it causes volcanos to pop up wherever it goes
