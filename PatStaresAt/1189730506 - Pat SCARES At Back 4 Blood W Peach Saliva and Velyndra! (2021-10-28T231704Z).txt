[0:15:53] <%LittleCinders> grabby patty
[0:15:53] <bob900000> I saw it move
[0:15:54] <@ssjklyco> Paige is an AI though
[0:15:55] <lemon_lover28> why was the dog napkin your first choice with a grabber right beside you?

[0:16:29] <bob900000> yeah
[0:16:29] <ergulor> ok that's true
[0:16:30] <%Felhad> FF13 isnt real it cant hurt you
[0:16:31] <%twistedj3ster> I don't think FF can be killed at this point
[0:16:35] <%JoshManVGH> Boy howdy!
[0:16:37] <%LaughingCatt> I second Pat's opinion
[0:16:37] <ExpressNode> Used to be all in on hating FF13 but there is good to be found in the bad
[0:16:37] <%dekkitout> "Franchise Killer" is a heavy term
[0:16:39] <%cvp5127> ff15 also
[0:16:42] <%SharkMissile> Yeah but 15 was terrible
[0:16:43] <%linSP> what about 15
[0:16:44] <@StridentSong> 14 almost bankrupted Square, *again*
[0:16:46] <%Cjjb1995> VINDICATION!
[0:16:46] <@ssjklyco> Imagine if those were the Final Final Fantasy
[0:16:47] <%dekkitout> Like, how do you kill the legacy FF7 has?
[0:16:47] <%YakumoYomi> I sincerely doubt that SE was gonna let FF die.
[0:16:48] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean some folks still like 13
[0:16:48] <lemon_lover28> 15 wasn't that great either
[0:16:49] <%JoshManVGH> That would explain the desperation with 15
[0:16:50] <%slothtouchingcloth> And 15
[0:16:52] <%shurtal> time to run The Praetorium like 10 times
[0:16:53] <%Frost_Quill> 13 had some cool characters but yeah.
[0:16:54] <%cvp5127> 15 was a trainwreck
[0:16:55] <+Kyma1020> I believe the 13 sequels and 14 1.0 almost killed the franchise
[0:16:56] <%Felhad> 15 is fine
[0:16:57] <+chiazam> hey I got here on time SWEET
[0:17:00] <%SaiyanShoto> 15 Royal is great
[0:17:00] <bob900000> it started at 10-2
[0:17:01] <MarylandJutsu> 16 looks good
[0:17:01] <+pectusumbra> 14 is already on record as nearly bankrupting SE wasn't it?
[0:17:02] <+pupil31> :D
[0:17:02] <ExpressNode> 15 is lackluster rather than bad
[0:17:04] <%solracc25> You give 13 TOO much credit pat
[0:17:05] <Pookiedaexzile> FF can't die they just change the number till you love it again
[0:17:06] <%SaiyanShoto> 15 original sucks though
[0:17:09] <ReaversEdge45> I knew someone who had gotten the plat for 13 so he’d never have to touch it again lol
[0:17:10] <%Puhff> How far had it gotten in Human Revolution? I'm gonna go with that
[0:17:10] <%JoshManVGH> 16 feels like the least desperate of their productions in recent years
[0:17:10] <%Agami23> i miss those 2 weeks where everyone loved ff15
[0:17:11] <Profmcstevie> 15 hit every pot hole and traffic cone
[0:17:12] <Treasure_Vault> Is the best Final Fantasy still the first one you play?
[0:17:13] <+xerotwo> LUL
[0:17:13] <%NitronStreams> the dark times
[0:17:16] <%Shikari21> 13 is good

[0:17:16] <%slothtouchingcloth> psaFist psaFist psaFist
[0:17:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Does she even know what she's talking about
[0:17:17] <IvanMistwalker> LUL
[0:17:18] <%urdumb4twitching> So, they basically have to push the series to 20 now right?
[0:17:20] <%Agami23> 13 had fang though
[0:17:21] <+Kyma1020> If 13 had no sequels it would have been fine.
[0:17:22] <+ArCielArDor> 14 is kinda shit
[0:17:22] <%Ne1son> Welcome to the Hallway of 13
[0:17:26] <%linSP> KINO
[0:17:26] <TheHeroAppears> it was a multifaceted failure
[0:17:28] <VirtuaRailith> FF13-3 is good. It just sadly features the cast of FF13
[0:17:31] <+nial_evol> xiii-2 saved 13
[0:17:31] <s1rcuit> I tried 13 and stopped at one spot because I couldn't progress for whatever reason, but I remember there was almost no mental engagement in the combat system
[0:17:32] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> I mean I didn't hate OG FF13 🤷♂️ I didn't FINISH it, and the sequels are dookie, but it iiiiis what it iiiiis.

[0:17:49] <%SharkMissile> Like the scene from HOT ROD
[0:17:50] <%linSP> Remember FF13-3?
[0:17:53] <+Prince_Kaboom> Holy crap that a BIG BOI
[0:17:57] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah!
[0:17:59] <@ssjklyco> I can't believe Lightning broke her neck
[0:18:03] <+nial_evol> 13-2 is better than 15
[0:18:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im 3/4 thru 15 and cannot find motivation to go on. It so dull
[0:18:07] <%Frost_Quill> It went to 13-3????!?!?
[0:18:09] <%SharkMissile> For David Cayege to consume?
[0:18:11] <%YakumoYomi> I honestly think XIII-2 is significantly better than XIII. Never played LR.
[0:18:14] <%JoshManVGH> Why!?
[0:18:14] <mikesapartment> doesn't she create france?
[0:18:18] <%NitronStreams> What
[0:18:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO NOT FRANCE
[0:18:20] <%Agami23> ff13 is better than ff8
[0:18:20] <%mckraven> 15 feels like the first reaction to the 13 and 14 misfire.
[0:18:22] <%JoshManVGH> What!?
[0:18:23] <%SharkMissile> lol wtf
[0:18:23] <%CheesesSliced> FX-2 is the magnum opus of the franchise
[0:18:24] <%slothtouchingcloth> 10-2 in the well
[0:18:26] <%NitronStreams> WHAT
[0:18:26] <bob900000> that sounds stupid
[0:18:27] <%cvp5127> ?

[0:18:28] <+chiazam> WHAT?
[0:18:29] <%BoxNavy> what the fuck
[0:18:29] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 What are your thoughts on the Halloween series as a whole and also the new Kills movie if you've seen it?
[0:18:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Pink Hair naturally is good for a Model right?
[0:18:32] <%Wallabri> wait that's how it ends? WHAT?
[0:18:32] <%JoshManVGH> You're making this up!
[0:18:34] <lemon_lover28> its ending is what??
[0:18:34] <%linSP> Look guys lightning is muh waif so she gets three games

[0:18:39] <IvanMistwalker> THAT SO STUPID
[0:18:39] <%MisterRockett> I'm sorry WHAT?!
[0:18:40] <%rekinom> Could be worse, she could have become a Quebecois supremacist
[0:18:40] <marvel877> Just spent an hour cleaning a smudge off a tv screen because my OCD would not let me ignore it, what I miss?

[0:18:43] <bob900000> no way that's real
[0:18:44] <@Ranryu692> I remember walking past the Louis Vuitton store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan and seeing pictures of Lightning in it
[0:18:44] <%Theycallmenerf> The worst FF to me is award winning FFXIV Heavensward.
[0:18:46] <Bonebagmel> eeeeeeeeeeeeeew
[0:18:48] <%chance_h> 15 is great because you can show your wife a picture of the lady you’ve been cucking her with
[0:18:48] <%mckraven> for sure

[0:18:55] <+RedKazoo> yes

[0:18:56] <marvel877> I HOPE SO
[0:18:56] <%Agami23> 1 for every outfit
[0:18:56] <%Ynkubus_> PLURAL
[0:18:58] <%SovPho> I think it's primarily because Nomura is starting to really phone it in. You can see his reliance on time travel shit increase more and more which is almost never a good story arc unless the story is literally about time travel ie. Interstellar.
[0:19:00] <%ahomeschooldropout> Toriyama would totally ERP as Lightning in 14
[0:19:00] <%maskofmichael> Paige, don't
[0:19:03] <delicious_mystery> And now Blizzard has the same thing with Stephen Danuseur and Sylvanas.
[0:19:04] <%solracc25> It's a fantasy OC wet dream
[0:19:06] <+YourRedDog> The reverse of an Isekai is staying in your world and living your fated life out.

[0:27:05] <Coystick> Paaaaaaige
[0:27:06] <%dekkitout> I felt crazy for also having a blast with the Guardians game. I usually hate everything
[0:27:06] <+chiazam> Pat you should actually check it out
[0:27:06] <Profmcstevie> Glad the studio got positive reception from it, it sounds like typical MCU chatter garbage
[0:27:06] <+ItalianWaifu> distracted by S M E L L
[0:27:06] <Zero_Jacks> @Zero_Jacks oh, hes racked up alot as of now
[0:27:06] <%AkronymCLT> The ads made Peter Quill seem insultingly stupid

[0:27:07] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> THE MOLD IS ALREADY KILLING PAIGE'S BRAIN
[0:27:08] <+Draygarth> I wasn't paying attention either
[0:27:08] <funnyfunnykid> shout chat can just spoil a thing and have you go "Wait [redacted] just sucked me off 3 minutes ago. What do you mean they are the secret boss?"
[0:27:08] <IvanMistwalker> LUL
[0:27:09] <%notsoy> this bodes well for the actual gameplay
[0:27:09] <%SWFanatic> Paige: "Yes, and what?"
[0:27:09] <%Theycallmenerf> I didn’t know I can turn off those specific chat channels

[0:27:19] <$realm_forge> PAIGE
[0:27:19] <scrumbotime> you have a direct line to her ears, and she still can't hear you
[0:27:20] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> the game definitely needs another pass on post processing.
[0:27:21] <+Kyma1020> Like it created a terrible first impression
[0:27:21] <%CheesesSliced> Paige got lost in Pat's eyes

[0:27:26] <@ssjklyco> Sniffing the bottle and drinking require multiple task
[0:27:30] <%SaiyanShoto> GOTG is great, much better than advertised
[0:27:36] <%KadusB> multi tasking, more like mouldy tasking with that gross waterbottle
[0:27:37] <%Nekros4442> Paige isnt gonna notice her teammates getting dragged off by specials
[0:27:38] <ExpressNode> Eggphones
[0:27:41] <oniwahoo> Onlyallowed to watch 2 episodes of Cyberpunk review, gotta pick 1, watch 0 of them until 8 because it's appropriate
[0:27:43] <$realm_forge> BUT WHERE WILL SHE BE IN 5 SECONDS
[0:27:43] <%slothtouchingcloth> I get more worries when Paige isn’t lost
[0:27:44] <+ItalianWaifu> she cant hear you the stink lines are blocking her sight
[0:27:47] <BoneofMalkav> Paige's brain's already struggling with multitasking like a Pentium 4 on a windows xp multimonitor machine LUL
[0:27:55] <AMajorTom> Gett-tcha some
[0:27:55] <%AgniBrandt> What kind of headphones are they?

[0:28:28] <Justlaxy> I only watched the latest one so I know that feeling
[0:28:29] <Pookiedaexzile> But what about the SHAPE
[0:28:30] <Madovir> I didn't care either until I saw the first one and it made me care

[0:40:53] <Bonebagmel> there's a alooot
[0:40:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Porno Ghost Suicide is the best game title
[0:40:56] <+Dakuu75> Question: Do Back 4 Blood zombies douible-die without headshots?
[0:40:57] <Justlaxy> Closing a door with no barricade is weird.
[0:40:59] <AMajorTom> HashPat sponsored

[0:41:10] <KaitlynnHere> He was like “oh no, he doesn’t like my porno ghost game :/L”
[0:41:11] <TheHeroAppears> sometimes it will spawn like 4 just to fuck with you
[0:41:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I throw my gun.
[0:41:16] <%linSP> throw your gun
[0:41:17] <scrumbotime> say hello to 3 or 4 different guys
[0:41:18] <delicious_mystery> i had 8 boomers, 3 talls boys and 2 charging boomers at the same time in a hallway

[0:41:27] <SaltyAzteca> That dudes been JACKIN IT
[0:41:27] <ReaversEdge45> “BOOMER!”
[0:41:29] <%maskofmichael> Why did that guy just throw his gun?
[0:41:30] <KaitlynnHere> I hate boomers
[0:41:30] <delicious_mystery> the game needs a serious balance patch
[0:41:30] <oniwahoo> Right, there's 2 Boomers, Pat and Paige
[0:41:33] <KaitlynnHere> Like pat
[0:41:35] <+Ancisace> Aww yeah, just in time.
[0:41:36] <Bonebagmel> pvp was kinda fucked wasn't it?
[0:41:36] <jorniev> haha cringe dialogue
[0:41:37] <%SharkMissile> I looooooooved that
[0:41:43] <+Dakuu75> THAT WOULDN'T WORK~!! I saw it on Myth Busters
[0:41:43] <+TheBitingIrish> Yeah, at least once I got jumped by 4 bruisers
[0:41:44] <ReaversEdge45> “RELOADIN HERE!”
[0:41:46] <%KineticZen> Jumping all over the place with Hunter was dope
[0:41:46] <Bonebagmel> too much
[0:41:48] <%twistedj3ster> It was awful
[0:41:48] <+Grayhammatter> Versus was so good
[0:41:49] <%KineticZen> And being sneaky Smoker
[0:41:51] <%CheesesSliced> +1 for a Lollipop Chainsaw/BFB crossover
[0:41:52] <fragdar> @PatStaresAt in veteran is something about 1 to 2k riden to kill each map.. kinda cool tbh
[0:41:54] <EntropyArcade> thats pretty hyperbolic
[0:41:55] <+Dotta5> PILLS HERE
[0:42:03] <$ArcanumArcanum> crazy talk strikes again
[0:42:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I see a Boomer rn Kappa
[0:42:10] <+JonathLP> Basic deck for a basic bitch
[0:42:10] <kazadaz> yeah asn't it like 30 sec?
[0:42:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Mom with the worst gun for the zombos possible
[0:42:10] <p3niletrauma> Pat Stares At Mom
[0:42:11] <%VictorVonLouche> Vs should let you fill in as fodder zombies while on cooldown
[0:42:12] <%KineticZen> With Source games you could adjust variables like respawn rate etc though
[0:42:12] <delicious_mystery> also the characters here are pale shades of ellis and coach
[0:42:12] <+MillionStabz> @EntropyArcade yeah thats pat
[0:42:15] <KaitlynnHere> Of course you’d pick the mom character
[0:42:16] <+RyTYoung> not as long as that, it could be anything from like 10-30 seconds
[0:42:16] <+Ancisace> Feels like there's 1-2k *specials*
[0:42:16] <jorniev> GRANDMA BILL
[0:42:17] <%dekkitout> I play shotgun in defense and end my turn
[0:42:18] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah, voice of cards is out today as well, for anyone up for more Yoko Taro writing
[0:42:22] <NEOFilly> i dont know why but that reminded me that killing floor 2 had a really meh vs mode where you played as the zombies
[0:42:25] <%Agami23> does this game have a versus mode like that? because i loved the L4D versus mode
[0:42:25] <oniwahoo> Snitches get scritches
[0:42:26] <%KineticZen> Also dedicated/private servers existed
[0:42:27] <%Fooguwu> but Pat is a snitch and is always triggered
[0:42:35] <+Dakuu75> can't you pick all of them?
[0:42:38] <prime_name> So, L4D with cards?
[0:42:44] <KaitlynnHere> Is Paige in another room?
[0:42:45] <Saltmeisterr> so how do cards work @PatStaresAt ?
[0:42:53] <%chance_h> L4D pvp was broken sometimes because you could trap and kill all the survivors in like 10 seconds
[0:42:53] <%CheesesSliced> Snitches get bitches, amiright?
[0:42:54] <delicious_mystery> im 11 hours in and voice of cards is neat but i cant tell if its about to drop a huge taro twist or its a straight revisit to DQ1/phantasy star style basic jrpgs
[0:43:02] <SaltyAzteca> Is there a Stoat card?
[0:43:07] <ReaversEdge45> “And I am Paige”
[0:43:08] <+RyTYoung> @agami23 it does, but instead of running through the levels, you are in a zone which gets smaller and smaller until you either survive or die, from what I know haven't tried it out yet
[0:43:13] <delicious_mystery> also boy it gets fetish horny
[0:43:18] <fragdar> hey yall.. to someone that already playerd.. knife is still fucking op?
[0:43:27] <%Monkeyweed21> eyy its Bot Evangelo
[0:43:31] <EntropyArcade> @prime_name it feels pretty different.. also theres stuff like reloading while you shove in this.
[0:43:34] <AMajorTom> Do the cards talk shit to you
[0:43:41] <%SWFanatic> Call of duty dog
[0:43:48] <+Ancisace> The cards are cowards that don't say shit
[0:43:52] <%slothtouchingcloth> Heart of the cards
[0:43:53] <%Nekros4442> knife is meh. It cant deal with multipleninfected at the same time
[0:43:55] <$Hommando> Phillips gives off "gonna be a villain in the DLC" vibes
[0:44:00] <+The_Death_Owl> cod zombies is ironically a comedy

[0:44:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> SHE ALREADY SHOT SOMEONE

[0:44:36] <+Dakuu75> yeah, that Ping shit from Apex was the best. Because whot he fuck wants to TALK to their team. (not even joking)
[0:44:37] <Bonebagmel> Typical gun american

[0:44:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Do you have any interest in a proper tactical military shooter?
[0:44:43] <Shwepie> L4D had an overarching story, but the concept for each campaign was more or less a treated as a horror movie.
[0:44:43] <+Alopekis> Paige is big and strong
[0:44:50] <KaitlynnHere> With her dick out
[0:44:55] <Justlaxy> @TheBitingIrish Their amazing Ping system.
[0:44:56] <oniwahoo> Bot is friend
[0:44:56] <+MillionStabz> Doesnt it feel weird to refer to your male friend by the name of their female game character?
[0:44:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Anyone play Insurgency: Sandstorm?
[0:44:59] <%twistedj3ster> Is Pat's gun semi auto?

[0:46:07] <+TheBitingIrish> Isn't that only when it's tier 2 or higher?
[0:46:13] <%Nekros4442> you need to upgrade ur items for more wire
[0:46:14] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt Razer wire is one-wide unless you upgrade your team's offensive items.
[0:46:15] <$Hommando> Drinking gasoline makes you run faster
[0:46:17] <%SWFanatic> why zombie mad
[0:46:26] <%Aleate> @patstaresat when you level up offensive items the razor wire gets bigger
[0:46:29] <+Ancisace> Brainworms
[0:46:30] <Bonebagmel> Defended the girlfriend
[0:46:32] <acratese> It gets bigger when you buy upgrades

[0:46:56] <%Valdorick> Pat will kill someone yet.
[0:46:57] <+zoopbooploop> pfff
[0:47:17] <+Ancisace> Yeah, that's about right.
[0:47:23] <LoliKappa> that's how i wanna go

[0:47:34] <SociopathicApe> Boomered
[0:47:38] <%orochiblood> regular thursday
[0:47:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> My only issue with the gunplay in this game is that the reload animation "charges" the weapon (loads the first round) as if the magazine was empty. It does this whether it's empty or not
[0:47:42] <Manwad> so there's like a special infected per pack it seems
[0:47:47] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:47:57] <AMajorTom> Ladder is OP
[0:48:02] <Mister_McDerp> typical ladders LUL
[0:48:04] <%twistedj3ster> I warned you about ladders bro
[0:48:09] <ToneBacas> help me bro i'm stuck on the ladder
[0:48:12] <%NitronStreams> Warned you about ladders bro
[0:48:15] <+Jack8274> Legit tho, Ladders are a huge source of work place accidents
[0:48:16] <+demon1103> got it...shoot all birds
[0:48:19] <+MillionStabz> But car alarms are car alarms
[0:48:19] <jorniev> Paige sounds like those fake gameplay voiceover from e3
[0:48:20] <TheHeroAppears> if birds are car alarms what are car alarms
[0:48:22] <%Piemono> Car alarms are also car alarms
[0:48:22] <s1rcuit> the witch in this is horrible
[0:48:36] <EntropyArcade> Im waiting for the first sleeper pin fleshyySip
[0:48:42] <ToneBacas> @jorniev can't unhear that
[0:48:42] <%SovPho> man like no one plays mom in veteran it's kinda sad
[0:48:43] <LoliKappa> i've always said that birds are car alarms, but now it makes sense
[0:48:47] <Pookiedaexzile> No pretense its just a witch
[0:48:47] <+Ancisace> Especially with the nightmare card that makes them guaranteed to scream even if you snipe them
[0:48:48] <+Alopekis> Tallboi
[0:48:52] <+sjay662> I really like Tallboy as a a zombie term
[0:48:55] <%DovaDude29> This game’s witch is the hag yeah?
[0:48:57] <AMajorTom> Bird is fed
[0:49:00] <SaltyAzteca> BIRD UP!
[0:49:02] <$Nero9341> @PatStaresAt if you kill all the birds fast enough, they don't trigger a horde
[0:49:07] <%SWFanatic> is this just better graphics l4d?
[0:49:19] <Parapattern> 2013 was almost a decade ago
[0:49:22] <+Kduff89> The gunplay is so loose but feels amazing
[0:49:25] <Dunmarkh> @SWFanatic It's l4d 3
[0:49:33] <%king_wragles> @Parapattern Yes n no
[0:49:36] <+Ancisace> Largely. Graphics are prettier but the visual design isn't as good IMO.
[0:49:43] <%Lizard0TM> Lizard0TM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[0:49:49] <%Valdorick> TALLBOI
[0:49:52] <%hereiam407> Boids
[0:49:52] <p3niletrauma> 400 copper me lord?
[0:49:56] <s1rcuit> @SWFanatic no, it's got other stuff going on, you've got more weapons, each gun can have attachments, and there's a perk card system
[0:49:59] <$Hommando> If you coordinate you can shoot the birds before they trigger an alarm
[0:49:59] <SaltyAzteca> I havent seen this many scary birds since Birdemic
[0:49:59] <+tempestzephyr> i wish i could heal my trauma
[0:50:06] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I'd still rather play L4D2 than this tbh
[0:50:09] <TheNewZealandStory> how would birds alert them more than the constant gunfire and screaming
[0:50:10] <s1rcuit> @tempestzephyr we all do
[0:50:14] <EntropyArcade> well, it definitely has better graphics than lfd. but i personally think its way overshadowed by L4D and the valve touch of that time
[0:50:16] <+Ancisace> Just take the heal childhood trauma card ez
[0:50:23] <marvel877> I take it birds are like car alarms in L4D?
[0:50:27] <%SWFanatic> @SWFanatic Is Louis or Ellis in it?
[0:50:33] <%Valdorick> Its true, leave that shopping cart OUT
[0:50:34] <+Ancisace> Yeah
[0:50:38] <+Alopekis> Shit ass crap
[0:50:40] <%twistedj3ster> mmmm mp5
[0:50:40] <+Jack8274> That only applies when you are not single pat
[0:50:41] <p3niletrauma> It won't bew Paige because she can't shoot anything, accidental or not
[0:50:46] <Pookiedaexzile> L4D is about hating your firneds
[0:50:46] <+Ancisace> Evangelo is meant to be the Louis but he's a charisma void
[0:50:51] <Dunmarkh> fuck you that shotgun is great... irl
[0:51:02] <EntropyArcade> @SWFanatic the voice of Rigby plays a character
[0:51:03] <AMajorTom> Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance for me, mama, come on baby tell me what's the bird, the bird up.
[0:51:14] <%Valdorick> Why is Angelo so fucking huge in that screen?
[0:51:22] <+Dakuu75> can we get a Poll on who's gonna die first?
[0:51:25] <%KetsuoTaberu> correct
[0:51:29] <%slothtouchingcloth> Pat punch fiancé psaDab
[0:51:31] <+Jack8274> Oh the Jukebox scene
[0:51:31] <Reanimator83> @patstaresat fun fact, pin the med station so the bot heals themselves
[0:51:32] <TheHeroAppears> did they ever fix that?
[0:51:32] <SociopathicApe> L4D could get SUPER toxic in random co-op
[0:51:35] <dawarw0lf> I've been playing this game for over a week. Help me
[0:51:36] <s1rcuit> I think they fixed that recently
[0:51:39] <AzureGale> veiLUL
[0:51:39] <%Laecerelius> WHYYYYYY
[0:51:40] <Mister_McDerp> monkaS dmca zombies
[0:51:42] <%SWFanatic> @EntropyArcade thats cool
[0:51:45] <ryderbootz> this game actually kinda reminds me of Left 4 Dead
[0:51:45] <+WeLucklessJacks> The Jukebox!
[0:51:46] <%Agami23> funny thing, i dont believe turning the music off actually turns it off. i think you need to turn off SFX
[0:51:51] <%KetsuoTaberu> The music actually works with the level so well, it's a shame you have to turn the music off
[0:52:00] <+Kduff89> wait motorhead did black betty?
[0:52:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Do the zambos still say the gamer word?
[0:52:10] <+Alopekis> Lootboxes
[0:52:14] <+lethallunacyx> I played with black betty playing last night
[0:52:14] <SaltyAzteca> Game needs more banjo
[0:52:18] <$Nero9341> @PatStaresAt you had to turn the SFX off, not the music
[0:52:18] <+sjay662> the music industry is actively making streaming worse
[0:52:26] <+WeLucklessJacks> IT'S TOO LATE IT'S TOO SOON IT'S TOO LATE IT'S TOO SOON IT'S TOO LATE IT'S TOO SOON OR IS IT TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK BOOM
[0:52:32] <marvel877> Remember when they did that for L4D2, but it was mostly songs made for the game and that Coulter song?
[0:52:34] <mikesapartment> team upgrade
[0:52:35] <dawarw0lf> upgrades are best first
[0:52:37] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt you need to turn of SFX too for the jukebox level, ias its tied to that
[0:52:43] <%maskofmichael> Don't spend it, you might need it later
[0:52:44] <+Kduff89> the music industry is making music worse fify
[0:52:45] <%Nekros4442> team upgrades are the best investment
[0:52:49] <+Jack8274> Team upgrades are HUGE since they last for the next half dozen levels
[0:52:51] <lloyddboy> LODESAEMONE
[0:53:00] <+ultimafullmetal> I kinda hate that there's a currency in this game
[0:53:05] <EntropyArcade> @SWFanatic yeah, the character Hoffman who is like a conspiracy head and was prepared for the apocalypse. but hes not being played by anyone rn
[0:53:07] <+Alopekis> Money money money
[0:53:09] <marvel877> @Kduff89 thank Metallica for that
[0:53:24] <+Kduff89> yeah that is where it started
[0:53:35] <SpookyMooks> !uptime
[0:53:35] <@Moobot> @SpookyMooks I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 53m 44s.
[0:53:38] <+Alopekis> Same
[0:53:39] <$Hommando> I felt the same way
[0:53:41] <%iErik4> iErik4 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:53:44] <Mister_McDerp> same
[0:53:46] <lemon_lover28> that was how I felt about L4D 1 as well
[0:53:48] <%FFXIVsFreeTrial> it didn't have the same soul
[0:53:48] <NEOFilly> was it the level ups?
[0:53:49] <%SovPho> KF2 is less endearing, feels more compact.
[0:53:52] <Justlaxy> same
[0:53:54] <+Kduff89> Fuck Lars Ulric
[0:53:56] <+tetraes> killingfloor 1 jsut looked and felt better to me imo
[0:53:56] <+Alopekis> I actually wish Killing Floor 2 was just an expansion of 1, for no real reason.
[0:53:58] <Mister_McDerp> KF1 just feels better
[0:54:00] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> It doesn't match the feel of the rest of the game
[0:54:02] <%ahomeschooldropout> Subtle changes to how AI spawned
[0:54:03] <%SovPho> Also KF1 has SO MANY MODS
[0:54:07] <%SWFanatic> bird
[0:54:07] <AzureGale> Weird, I put a TON of hours in KF2. Helped that upgrading perks wasn't a pain in the ass
[0:54:10] <%MugenSandan> There's an expectation that a sequel offers more than the first entry
[0:54:15] <EntropyArcade> Did Pat and Woolie talk on the podcast about DOOMs Horde mode??
[0:54:15] <%Logoth_> bird up
[0:54:19] <%chance_h> Enemies Everywhere!
[0:54:20] <%JoshManVGH> Why are these birds so evil?
[0:54:24] <%BisoromiBear> "If you want to listen to my shitty drumming you better fucking pay me" -Lars
[0:54:25] <%Felhad> WATCH OUT, BIRBS
[0:54:31] <+RowenCleric> arent gunshots louder then birds...?
[0:54:33] <MittensBroadcast> its cause there were strategies you can make to midgate the zombies. but l4d2 made it so that there is to much chaos
[0:54:35] <+Ancisace> They serve evil caws-es
[0:54:50] <+lordericter> AGAIN
[0:54:50] <+Alopekis> No. Birds are WAY louder than gunshots.
[0:54:51] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @RowenCleric No, shut up
[0:54:52] <%SWFanatic> nice
[0:55:00] <%maskofmichael> Nice
[0:55:01] <$Hommando> Your homie is telling you lies right now
[0:55:03] <%Nekros4442> Wait until you get en9ugh accuracy from cards so that ur crosshair becomes a fucking dot and you snipe fuckers by hip firing a lmg
[0:55:04] <%SWFanatic> copper wire wins
[0:55:06] <AzureGale> Like, in KF1, if you weren't playing multiplayer, it could take a long time to get a perk to level TWO
[0:55:12] <HyperionXV> I thought the extra sides of wire were for upgraded ones?
[0:55:13] <BoneofMalkav> KF2's more stable but has this odd sterile feeling about it's gameplay. KF1 is less stable but feels alot better gameplay wise even with heavy modding
[0:55:17] <+sjay662> Welcome to the Swamp
[0:55:19] <+Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt now I'm invested and I wanna see you use the wire, correctly
[0:55:22] <EntropyArcade> thats level 1 barbed wire, you can upgrade your "offensive slot" for more wire in 1
[0:55:22] <SaltyAzteca> WutFace
[0:55:23] <+smackbear> you get more segments only if the wire is upgraded like the support item is
[0:55:24] <$Hommando> @HyperionXV You are right
[0:55:27] <%Sotetsu> Wow, they finally added guns to DBD
[0:55:30] <+Ancisace> That shitball seems undodgeable - it *always* hits me
[0:55:31] <+LuckAndCharisma> Pat you have to upgrade it to increase the size
[0:55:37] <Coystick> They have a cave troll
[0:55:37] <+Kduff89> oh god get to the tunnel you fools
[0:55:45] <+Gamefriendly> the copper wire isn't leveled up so its area coverage is very low rn
[0:55:47] <$Hommando> You can kill him if you're capital G gamers
[0:55:50] <AzureGale> And even then, you don't get any meaningful upgrades to your perks until like level 3 or 4
[0:55:53] <+Epic_Fubar> you gain more wire if you upgrade offensive items
[0:55:54] <+Grayhammatter> da birds
[0:55:55] <+JonathLP> birb
[0:56:07] <+lordericter> u r da baby
[0:56:07] <dawarw0lf> I got a hot tip for everybody, change the weakspots color blind option for better visual clearity
[0:56:11] <+Kduff89> Doc is so good
[0:56:16] <+Epic_Fubar> B I R D
[0:56:19] <+Alopekis> Throw gas at the birds
[0:56:29] <+Kduff89> Then you upgrade the infirmary and get all the healy cards
[0:56:37] <AzureGale> #worthit
[0:56:42] <+MillionStabz> Da bird is Jontron
[0:56:53] <Tomschiii> wish the Game had a small dash
[0:56:55] <TheHeroAppears> @Alopekis this isn't the Olympics
[0:57:02] <$Hommando> Every car that looks like a Ford can be looted
[0:57:25] <AzureGale> Toolkit ? defib
[0:57:29] <+Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt NO, don't give up on the wire Pat! We believe in you~!
[0:57:34] <%Sotetsu> I like to say "defribulator"
[0:57:35] <AzureGale> > *
[0:57:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Well Start the timer
[0:57:52] <+Alopekis> This looks fun
[0:58:01] <%tank7013> "We're not gonna have anyone die" is a dangerous thing to say around Pat
[0:58:07] <NEOFilly> oh he turns nakey when you shoot the weak point
[0:58:17] <+Alopekis> Whoever threw that molotov is super cool and handsome and funny
[0:58:23] <%KetsuoTaberu> legendary mag is nice
[0:58:31] <%twistedj3ster> it's also automatic
[0:58:33] <%KetsuoTaberu> big ammo
[0:58:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> why's the door scared?
[0:58:59] <marvel877> I want to play L4D2 now, but all I have is an almost 8 year old laptop that overheats trying to watch twitch streams.
[0:59:02] <%sleepy_coffee> Don’t worry the shotgun has a rifle scope and buckshot
[0:59:19] <ZegarWildheart> psaGiefrail
[0:59:25] <ZegarWildheart> Giefy!!!’
[0:59:28] <ZegarWildheart> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[0:59:43] <+Alopekis> Looks fine to me
[0:59:44] <%Valdorick> We're doing
[0:59:46] <Weeabooninja> looks good
[0:59:48] <%afronooch> its fine
[0:59:49] <+CherteuseKapibara> 10/10
[0:59:50] <%MooseIsGoose> good
[0:59:54] <marvel877> looks okay
[0:59:56] <+chiazam> Looks fine
[1:00:09] <+Alopekis> Yes! Bolt action rifles in a zombie game!
[1:00:10] <+Ancisace> There's an intel pack in there on the bed
[1:00:10] <marvel877> how's this game on console?
[1:00:17] <zetsubouman> I like how you and Paige talk like l4d characters
[1:00:43] <+lordericter> try not to lose that ax in any pits Pat
[1:00:44] <%Wallabri> sniper ripel
[1:00:49] <NeroInfinite> the sniper with no scope. LUL
[1:00:58] <+Alopekis> Especially not the axe pit
[1:00:59] <AzureGale> I gotta keep that tactic in mind
[1:01:03] <+Ancisace> Worked for that Finnish guy
[1:01:15] <+Alopekis> lol Paige
[1:01:24] <+Alopekis> I think she's shot more friendlies than zombies
[1:01:40] <%Sotetsu> Is the audio quiet for anyone else?
[1:01:48] <+TEANTACLES> what difficulty are they playing on
[1:01:49] <zetsubouman> controller moment
[1:01:51] <+Alopekis> Sounds fine to me
[1:01:57] <+lordericter> it seems worse
[1:02:02] <%SWFanatic> its like a rancor
[1:02:06] <%Sotetsu> I just need to crank it, then.
[1:02:19] <%doomunderthestairs> doomunderthestairs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[1:02:33] <+Alopekis> Always take the sniper rifle for RP purposes
[1:02:44] <tlflordhand> snipers suck at hordes, they only good for specials with the added corruption cards is their main use LUL
[1:02:45] <%Valdorick> Pat, you know what you must do... shoot the car.
[1:02:45] <jbrachob> SHOOT THE CAR
[1:03:02] <+Alopekis> Shoot the car and blame Piage
[1:03:06] <delicious_mystery> oh yeah fyi if anyone doesnt know you can make a new campaign starting at the sound of thunder at the end of act 1 and do the 2 minute mission for 20-40 supply currency and can spam that to unlock actually useful cards
[1:03:08] <berserkexponent> Old lady Pat lets go
[1:03:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Why take the sawed off over the two other shotguns
[1:03:34] <tlflordhand> for ex, armored specials ez one shot with an epic phoenix with the best mods and ap
[1:03:35] <tigerfang86> yo is that [BOT[ EVANGELO
[1:03:38] <tigerfang86> I love that guy
[1:03:40] <%Sotetsu> Sick arm physics, brah
[1:03:41] <sammie779> psa3guy
[1:03:48] <%twohitgood> it seems more like cod
[1:04:03] <%KetsuoTaberu> that sniper scope LUL
[1:04:03] <+lordericter> the shotgun has a scope
[1:04:08] <tigerfang86> but it's funny
[1:04:09] <+lordericter> when the sniper didn't
[1:04:09] <dawarw0lf> gameplay is less acrady then l4d for better or worse
[1:04:10] <+Grayhammatter> shotgun with a rifle scope LUL
[1:04:12] <+Kduff89> shotgun with full sniper scope. Just like in my battlefields
[1:04:12] <%GarbageNirvana> I usually go with whatever has better attachments
[1:04:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> It shoots slugs presumably
[1:04:14] <+Alopekis> Shotguns should always have sniper scopes
[1:04:18] <Reanimator83> @pookiedaexzile sawed office is a secondary weapon
[1:04:18] <%GarbageNirvana> also lol scope shotgun
[1:04:20] <Manwad> the viking shotgun, BF3 style
[1:04:23] <%Valdorick> SCOPED SHOTGUN... maybe its slugged?
[1:04:28] <Reanimator83> off*
[1:04:28] <Mister_McDerp> thats a battlefield shotgun LUL
[1:04:29] <%notsoy> i mean, there have been shooters in the past where the shotguns had way too much range lol
[1:04:31] <%SovPho> High zoom scopes increase the damage of all guns
[1:04:36] <neroforte177> pat you don't know guns stoppid
[1:04:43] <+Alopekis> Grab your asses goodbye?
[1:04:44] <%dekkitout> Was that a scope or a short range sight?
[1:04:44] <+Kduff89> man I hope 2042 is good
[1:04:50] <%MisterRockett> it might be a slug shotty! are there slug shotties?
[1:04:53] <+TheBitingIrish> It probably won't be
[1:04:55] <+Alopekis> 2042 looks fun
[1:05:01] <Mister_McDerp> I have no faith in 2042
[1:05:05] <tigerfang86> yaaaaaaaaaaay
[1:05:05] <+Ancisace> There are not. That I've found anyway
[1:05:10] <+Alopekis> It pretty much just looks like a return to BF3/4
[1:05:13] <+Kduff89> beta was a buggy mess. It made me sad
[1:05:17] <%MisterRockett> awwwww
[1:05:26] <+sjay662> wasn't the beta busted to shit?
[1:05:27] <%SovPho> Dude the beta for BF2042 is so bad.
[1:05:28] <+kevlarkoala> no clue why people hate on this game? other than bugs which I get, this game is so fun
[1:05:31] <dawarw0lf> @misterrockett no but with 100% accuracy cards all of them can be
[1:05:32] <AzureGale> SQUAD
[1:05:32] <%Aleate> @patstaresat That is the normal size for the razor wire at white rarity. It gets bigger as you level up the Offensive slot items.
[1:05:33] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean I had fun with 4, if it's just 4 again that's alright
[1:05:33] <IvanMistwalker> the Operators suck.
[1:05:36] <%Valdorick> Big and Strong Paige
[1:05:39] <Mister_McDerp> yeah the beta was fucked
[1:05:41] <%GarbageNirvana> But yeah I'ma need people to play with
[1:05:42] <+Ancisace> I'll battle your field.
[1:05:44] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> 2042 might choke your CPU, @patstaresat .
[1:05:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Call it The Red Squad! Or Shit Squad
[1:05:45] <+Grayhammatter> big and strong
[1:05:52] <tigerfang86> MANY reasons
[1:05:53] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:06:01] <+SenorCounter> tons-O-reasons
[1:06:08] <+demon1103> I'm weirdly excited for the new Battlefield game....but not for the game itself. But because Battlefield Friends are back baby!!!
[1:06:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[1:06:13] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt  sorry to keep spamming you on this, but when it comes to the jukebox level you NEED to disable SFX not just music
[1:06:17] <%BogBodyPositive> there are no slug shotties but accuracy cards can make the cone incredibly tight
[1:06:18] <%g0atmeal> an unoptimized game can choke any cpu
[1:06:20] <delicious_mystery> "its relatively recent" the "30 is still 'the youth' right?" of computer hardware
[1:06:26] <%ahomeschooldropout> I'm more interested in the Portal mode than 2042 itself
[1:06:32] <tigerfang86> get JUICED
[1:06:43] <+Kduff89> @demon1103 I hope Birgirpall makes a comeback too
[1:07:01] <+CherteuseKapibara> Saiga
[1:07:07] <zombieKillaKlown> Get combat knife like a automatic melee weapon
[1:07:14] <%dekkitout> Huh, do the shotguns have no concern for pellet count/spread?
[1:07:19] <+SenorCounter> It would replace you main hand
[1:07:24] <Pookiedaexzile> GET THE AA
[1:07:40] <+CherteuseKapibara> automatic ap shotgun
[1:07:46] <+Grayhammatter> tow shotguns?
[1:07:55] <%BogBodyPositive> so with high zoom scopes it's pretty necessary to get aim down sight speed. then you can abuse the heavy aim assist on raising your gun to your sightline, and just insta lock on enemy after enemy.
[1:07:55] <+Grayhammatter> two* even
[1:07:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Hard
[1:08:05] <%twistedj3ster> it's got so little recoil
[1:08:07] <+Ancisace> Yeah, a sawnoff is one of the sidearms, it's the one Mom starts with.
[1:08:10] <%dekkitout> It'll also rip through ammo reserve, as most aa20's do
[1:08:12] <EntropyArcade> full auto shotty is so funnn
[1:08:14] <%chance_h> Yes
[1:08:31] <+kevlarkoala> you can tell which version of the special ridden it is by looking at it's weakpoints
[1:08:41] <delicious_mystery> whereas l4d had actually decent sound design to let you know
[1:08:41] <+kevlarkoala> which is nice, but i do wish they were more visually distinct
[1:08:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe that Pat is cheating
[1:08:46] <EntropyArcade> if only the audio cues told you, like L4D..
[1:08:54] <+kevlarkoala> that too @delicious_mystery
[1:08:56] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Big cheats being used right now I guess
[1:08:58] <Mister_McDerp> I always used closed captions in l4d LUL
[1:09:10] <oniwahoo> I appreciate the Trailer Park Boys reference
[1:09:27] <Pookiedaexzile> YES
[1:09:27] <delicious_mystery> just dont get pat ranting about Conky again
[1:09:30] <+Alopekis> Closed captions are for cowards
[1:09:33] <%BogBodyPositive> the shotgun Pat has is not damage to ammo efficient but boy howdy does it mow down enemies
[1:09:35] <EntropyArcade> this game has SO many references
[1:09:40] <+Alopekis> I turn the monitor completely off when I play L4D games
[1:09:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> am I the only one who feels like No one has wanted to play Bloodborne this season? I'm waiting on someone to do a play through :(
[1:10:06] <%BlackStarAura> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:10:18] <+TheBitingIrish> @TurtlesAndTentacles LobosJr has been
[1:10:24] <+Alopekis> lol losers lost their settlement
[1:10:26] <+TheBitingIrish> Like 7 times in fact
[1:10:30] <SomeAsianDood> People will play bloodborne when it hits PC. So never
[1:10:41] <%hereiam407> Monay
[1:10:44] <oniwahoo> fuckin nerds got rekt by zombies
[1:11:20] <delicious_mystery> ITS A HERO SHOOTER PAT, sort of!
[1:11:37] <p3niletrauma> Nice job using your body to block that monster's giant fucking punch!
[1:11:39] <+CherteuseKapibara> " I main mom" majinoMonday
[1:11:40] <%g0atmeal> lobos could beat BB with his eyes closed, not quite the same as a first lp
[1:11:40] <tlflordhand> reason for that is it would be too ez if for ex you had a team of moms
[1:11:49] <EntropyArcade> @SomeAsianDood apparently there are some consistent rumors about a bloodborne port.. and other things
[1:11:52] <tlflordhand> everyone gets better heals and insta rez
[1:12:04] <%dekkitout> That's very on brand
[1:12:05] <AzureGale> That was sarcasm, Pat
[1:12:06] <+lordericter> true to life
[1:12:06] <%cvp5127> its like a mirror
[1:12:06] <slix3431> Fellow French canadians. Is Tabernacle racist?
[1:12:09] <dawarw0lf> Holly can get very annoying
[1:12:12] <+RyTYoung> I
[1:12:18] <%Valdorick> Eat the Garbage sandwich filled with bees.
[1:12:30] <oniwahoo> Need a mod for hurty sand, mold and glass
[1:12:35] <%Tearonex> Pat is deaf to sarcasm LUL
[1:12:38] <tlflordhand> all the characters are annoying, the writing in this is ass LUL
[1:12:48] <delicious_mystery> oh lord dont wake the quebecoi nationalists again, they almost forgot about pat and his foul english speaking bride
[1:12:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Kill them all, Jason
[1:12:57] <MiamiMemory> Whats this? A zombie infested forrest woefully underpopulated by bees?! My gun full of bees should put a stop to this!
[1:13:08] <EntropyArcade> yeah, characters are nottt charming or deep
[1:13:10] <dawarw0lf> Hoffman is okay, its rigby’s voice actor
[1:13:11] <%AncelDeLambert> ... what?
[1:13:27] <%BogBodyPositive> BogBodyPositive subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! the heavy aim assist when raising your gun up to your sightline can be abused with aim down sight speed cards. it makes it so you can keep tapping ads and fire and every shot will auto hit an enemy.
[1:13:34] <%AncelDeLambert> do... the developers know how bullets work?
[1:13:54] <p3niletrauma> ...did the character just horribly butcher the word 'cache'?
[1:13:57] <lemon_lover28> of that is pretty strong
[1:14:01] <%barkon345> so is this game beter or worse then left for dead 2?
[1:14:06] <+TheBitingIrish> Even stronger than Destiny 2? I think Destiny 2 ruined my aim for good
[1:14:06] <%dekkitout> How's the reticle stickiness
[1:14:11] <delicious_mystery> worse
[1:14:19] <%Tearonex> @AncelDeLambert I guess the logic is that it uses the same calibur of round as a sniper, which does check out
[1:14:23] <delicious_mystery> not unfixable but needed a major balance patch before retail
[1:14:25] <+Grayhammatter> very reticle
[1:14:27] <tlflordhand> you can adjust that though in settings
[1:14:32] <SomeAsianDood> @EntropyArcade yeah I heard the rumors. I hear them every year just like an mgs remake or silent hill project. I'm just too jaded
[1:14:32] <+GrateMan> This also runs pretty well on potatoes. I'm suprised.
[1:14:35] <+Ancisace> Better in a few ways but I preferred L4D.
[1:14:36] <%SWFanatic> Reticle 2: Extra sticky
[1:14:43] <Coystick> The baby aim
[1:14:48] <%strakillias> That transcends auto aim, its more like a lock-on
[1:14:48] <acratese> I like this game so much better than L4D
[1:14:59] <EntropyArcade> it depends what you enjoy @barkon345 .. i really enjoyed l4d2's endless variety and asymmetrical modes.. b4b does nottt have that
[1:14:59] <+SuperFightinRobot> I can't believe pat is a baby. How were we supposed to know?
[1:15:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Good bot
[1:15:05] <Manwad> i wish more games had lock on
[1:15:06] <DomunDomunDomun> @barkon345 It has progression bullshit, so it's automatically worse.
[1:15:10] <delicious_mystery> aim sticky is fine till something runs past and magnet pulls your aim away with it. destiny 2 was awful at launch with that
[1:15:11] <%SirGO0SE> Ngl looks tight
[1:15:20] <%AncelDeLambert> can you imagine trying to hold a handgun that loads rifle rounds? LUL
[1:15:24] <lemon_lover28> just ignoring the zombies ahahah
[1:15:42] <+TheBitingIrish> Is that why Doc has a busted knee? Gymnastics accident?
[1:15:44] <%AncelDeLambert> jesus, Pat's hand looks like Ash at the end of Evil Dead
[1:15:45] <+chiazam> this seems pretty easy so far
[1:16:04] <dawarw0lf> the setting that's missing for controllers is aim acceleration. is why it might feel off
[1:16:15] <slix3431> BOOMER
[1:16:17] <%Valdorick> oof
[1:16:18] <acratese> The jump from recruit to veteran is ridiculously hard
[1:16:18] <EntropyArcade> @barkon345 im using a new account on xbox game pass to play this game for 1$ on PC. thats what id suggest if you have interest
[1:16:32] <Pookiedaexzile> At least he saved some shotgun ammo
[1:16:40] <oniwahoo> What is PATrons? Sub count?
[1:16:44] <+SuperFightinRobot> I think I saw a mockup of something like that. just a handgun with a grip the width of my leg.
[1:16:59] <%SirGO0SE> Uhohstinky
[1:17:02] <%AncelDeLambert> coughQuietShycough
[1:17:05] <%Nekros4442> you learn that people in front have to crouch real fuckin quick
[1:17:07] <p3niletrauma> This is the weirdest L Ron Hubbard book
[1:17:08] <%SovPho> There's a perk that makes you immune/do no friendly damage when you crouch, it's almost necessary to get.
[1:17:15] <HyperionXV> There's a reason one of the most used cards is the "no friendly fire while crouching" cards
[1:17:22] <+Ancisace> I love that perk.
[1:17:27] <tigerfang86> Classic [BOT] EVANGELO
[1:17:30] <tigerfang86> I love that guy
[1:17:36] <%NovaKnightmare> is Evangelo having a seizure?
[1:17:49] <%SirGO0SE> EVANGELO is my favorite Pat Stares At guest
[1:17:59] <+Alopekis> [BOT] Evangelo always knows how to lighten the mood.
[1:17:59] <+Ancisace> I need to sub to [BOT] Evangelo's twitch sometime.
[1:18:00] <%Valdorick> Pro-pain and pro-pain accessories
[1:18:02] <EntropyArcade> BOTs are trash in this..
[1:18:16] <+Alopekis> You're trash in this
[1:18:21] <%SovPho> @EntropyArcade That's literally just false.
[1:18:40] <acratese> Bots ai are shit but are ridiculously overpowered when they do shoot
[1:18:41] <%BogBodyPositive> I honestly disagree, I've had way better plays with BOTS than some players
[1:18:42] <EntropyArcade> i love Hollys Stamina regen on kill
[1:18:44] <therealritzreal> all i have to say about this game Fuck the HAG in solo
[1:18:50] <+Grayhammatter> you... did it
[1:18:52] <AMajorTom> HashPat Coop stream
[1:19:00] <Major_Lee_> Doc's buffed healing is insane. If you put enough cards in a deck she basically gets a free medkit
[1:19:01] <+Wolfstriker121> everyone go pee!!
[1:19:09] <+Dakuu75> all the babies need to pee
[1:19:09] <%BogBodyPositive> oh lord the hag is so gross
[1:19:13] <+SuperFightinRobot> Urine break
[1:19:14] <%strakillias> Pat had to take Paige out too
[1:19:17] <%Puhff> im a baby take me to pee
[1:19:23] <%baka_sugoi> evertbody P
[1:19:27] <+Ancisace> These streamers are taking the piss :v
[1:19:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> BOOMER
[1:19:32] <%SovPho> The hag is countered by melee builds it's super weird
[1:19:34] <acratese> The hag gives the good long suck
[1:19:39] <Coystick> Paige had to produce more water
[1:19:40] <dawarw0lf> the thing with doc's ability is that its a one time use per level
[1:19:42] <@Velyndra> stinky babby go poo poo
[1:19:43] <delicious_mystery> so how long after the first hag does paige somehow start talking about vore and leading it into something about sanic?
[1:19:51] <Major_Lee_> Dont get vored by the hag
[1:19:51] <EntropyArcade> the only benefit to bots ive experienced is that they teleport to you. but cant even save you from a pin or when your downed or anything ESSENTIAL for solo play
[1:20:05] <+Ancisace> Best part of bots is the infinite ammo
[1:20:07] <SomeAsianDood> Wait is the doctor the only asian character in the game Hmm
[1:20:12] <therealritzreal> she makes solo unplayable
[1:20:14] <dawarw0lf> bots have infinite ammo and get full heals every level
[1:20:15] <AMajorTom> Did you know it was actually LeVar Burton as the detective in the music video for Word Up by Cameo
[1:20:21] <delicious_mystery> Never get vored kids. For your health
[1:20:21] <+twenty112> Bots will also call out special infected through walls
[1:20:30] <Major_Lee_> I feel like bot AI is improved on solo play vs multiplayer
[1:20:49] <delicious_mystery> try act 4 with bots
[1:21:08] <EntropyArcade> yeah you get all those things but bots still cant manage essential saves.
[1:21:13] <%BogBodyPositive> also hag is avoidable
[1:21:24] <@Velyndra> @BogBodyPositive tell that to the pugs
[1:21:31] <acratese> Best part of bots is that there’s a card that heals everyone when someone goes down so you just down the bot when the teams low
[1:21:41] <delicious_mystery> tell that to pat and paige
[1:21:48] <@Velyndra> LUL
[1:21:55] <%SirGO0SE> Yeah but can bots see why kids love cinamon toast crunch?
[1:21:55] <%BogBodyPositive> @velyndra hahahahaha
[1:22:48] <dawarw0lf> I've had more randoms alert the hag on recrrit then veteran in my experience. it seems most get it eventually
[1:23:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, would you say you're back... for blood?
[1:23:14] <delicious_mystery> I recommend pot of greed and polymerisation
[1:23:18] <+JonathLP> COMBAT KNIFE
[1:23:21] <+JonathLP> NO ITS THE BEST
[1:23:23] <tigerfang86> that's the power of being a mom, Pat
[1:23:24] <%BogBodyPositive> @sirgo0se Bots can see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch through walls before it's visible to players. it's pretty broken.
[1:23:29] <tigerfang86> maternal strength
[1:23:31] <%SirGO0SE> this card stuff isnt microtransaction bait is it?
[1:23:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> PILLS HERE
[1:23:33] <%king_wragles> Knife melee is super strong, Wounded Animal is worthless so you'll want to replace it when you can
[1:23:35] <GeneralHysterics> yo, this game rules
[1:23:36] <%dekkitout> Mom's spaghetti is strong
[1:23:37] <DomunDomunDomun> That sounds insanely good.
[1:23:37] <dawarw0lf> it should be per team like doc
[1:23:43] <%baka_sugoi> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[1:23:43] <%SirGO0SE> @BogBodyPositive damn theyre good
[1:23:45] <%Puhff> BABY
[1:23:53] <tigerfang86> @SirGO0SE it's all in-game stuff, no buy ins
[1:23:53] <lloyddboy> b a b y
[1:23:55] <delicious_mystery> but did you remember to give mom dead hard and disicive strike?
[1:23:55] <AzureGale> CAT

[1:24:01] <hidden_character> KITTY KITTY
[1:24:02] <s1rcuit> fluffy baby
[1:24:08] <delicious_mystery> pspspspspspspspsps
[1:24:11] <%Nekros4442> Combat knife is only great until you get swarmed and you cant push back more than 1 infected at a time
[1:24:11] <%SirGO0SE> @tigerfang86 nice, game seems pretty rad tbh
[1:24:14] <%SWFanatic> Elmo
[1:24:23] <%Aleate> Mom is basically the other Support character than Doc. She's surprisingly helpful IF your team can do good damage
[1:24:25] <CatRidder> pet the baby
[1:24:28] <dawarw0lf> knife melee is super bad, avoid it at all cosrs. the shoving from basic melee is miles better
[1:24:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> saint wlmo blesses us
[1:24:31] <%BogBodyPositive> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo

[1:41:21] <+Das_Prints> @ancisace if you mean that circle thing on the bottom left that usually means a buff or debug. That one I think let’s you know that you can quick rez someone as part of Mom’s passive.
[1:41:24] <+Ancisace> Fair enough thanks

[1:42:23] <dawarw0lf> @ancisace oh, it does damage like any battle royale circle does
[1:42:31] <ToneBacas> the bot is sniffing out some action for you guys
[1:42:37] <+Ancisace> 👍
[1:42:38] <GeneralHysterics> the Vector is so aesthetic
[1:42:51] <softbirby> Fun fact, bots dont take damage from acid and take reduced damage compared to players
[1:42:54] <%ahomeschooldropout> I just bought an AK recently, it's very nice
[1:42:59] <+EdenOfLove> replace other gun with big blue shotgun?
[1:43:05] <softbirby> they also have infinite healthpacks
[1:43:11] <dawarw0lf> Fuck Sleepers
[1:43:16] <+Das_Prints> @ancisace it’s basically to force you to fight the breaker and not run from him. If you leave the circle you take damage.
[1:43:25] <%king_wragles> You REALLY want a compensator for the AK
[1:43:27] <NEOFilly> i kind of hate that

[2:08:23] <cs0402196> can paige screech when danger happens?
[2:08:28] <dawarw0lf> Is that their fault tho
[2:08:28] <%MidnightBurst12> DMCA was a mistake
[2:08:28] <delicious_mystery> just sing your favourite song from tony hawks pro skater 2 instead
[2:08:33] <AMajorTom> Selections from the Andrew Lloyd Webber collection, surely that's not copywrited
[2:08:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> They wanted L4d2 stage ending...but FAILED
[2:08:37] <%strakillias> Pat can you mute the game audio for the stream and then have your own sound?
[2:08:37] <+cubbywolf> seems even worse here than I gaurdians

[2:36:29] <AzureGale> This isn't too bad
[2:37:07] <AzureGale> Strategy: Kill everyoen and dont die lol
[2:37:16] <tlflordhand> only on recruit doe
[2:37:42] <tlflordhand> any spot works so long as you dont have a potato team on this dif
[2:37:43] <%polothegreatest> got some red on you
[2:37:44] <%WhereIsWill> point blank grenades yeyeye
[2:37:52] <%PocketBearIllustrator> also, this game actively punishes you for playing solo. you won't gain any experience if you're not playing the co-op.
[2:38:02] <+Dakuu75> I feel like pipe bombs would make this trivial if you could save a bunch for it but, idk.
[2:38:20] <AzureGale> Point-blank grenades, the best move
[2:38:36] <AzureGale> Just pretend you're Doomguy with the blood punch
[2:38:42] <%MidnightBurst12> EZ
[2:38:42] <MaybeFalco> you might say your survival might.... come down to the wire
[2:38:57] <+gantz_zero> #TheWire
[2:39:02] <+Dakuu75> @MaybeFalco oh, GOD DAMN IT~!!! (lol)
[2:39:10] <AzureGale> @MaybeFalco veiLUL
[2:39:12] <tlflordhand> their fate lies on the edge of a razors wire.. Kappa
[2:39:29] <AzureGale> This fight sure was... explosive
[2:39:47] <GeneralHysterics> the sound of this absolutely manic situation is weirdly calming
[2:40:01] <GeneralHysterics> I love the sound design in this game
[2:40:05] <+gantz_zero> Bernie Shot
[2:40:17] <AzureGale> Oh wait I got a better one - This battle is about to explode. FIGHT!

[2:41:30] <%jhinbappo> Hello today!
[2:41:31] <akitanito> just ignore all those zombies
[2:41:40] <AzureGale> 👏👏👏👏👏👏
[2:41:51] <%strakillias> Every time Pat says Bot Evangelo I hear Buff Angelo
[2:41:53] <%dekkitout> I wonder how much drones would actually trivialize the zombie apocalypse
[2:41:55] <%SirGO0SE> D:
[2:41:56] <dawarw0lf> that you used during the fight
[2:41:57] <%SWFanatic> stupid sexy botangelo
[2:41:59] <+gantz_zero> the other zombies morale was broken so decisively they collapsed into lifeless piles
[2:42:02] <AzureGale> I wanna cosplay as Doc
[2:42:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PatStaresAt it's America, you spent hundreds of bullets to get 2 medkits.
[2:42:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Does paige ever pick a character that doesnt look like her?
[2:42:33] <%Wrangler117> Wrangler117 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[2:42:39] <%SWFanatic> fuck, health insurance persists into the apocalypse?
[2:42:41] <+Dakuu75> @TurtlesAndTentacles Lol, now that you mention it, no.
[2:42:44] <BigYanno> If zombies die as easily as they seem to how did the apocalypse get this bad?
[2:42:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TurtlesAndTentacles if there's a character that looks like you, why would you pick anyone else?
[2:42:59] <%Neryl_> Neryl_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 24 month streak! dun it
[2:43:19] <%hereiam407> Just finished Halloween Kills, it really sucked
[2:43:21] <+Dakuu75> Can I spend real money on booster packs?
[2:43:23] <akitanito> a human chainsaw
[2:43:30] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The only thing I have against B4B is the characters aren't as interesting as the L4D crews
[2:43:31] <%notsoy> lol million stab
[2:43:33] <dawarw0lf> the cards can make it play like Left 4 Dead, no sprint and no ads
[2:43:35] <+smackbear> oh yeah the "meth head" card
[2:43:35] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @Dakuu75  Her and Max either have tons of fans or are the most common looking people lol
[2:43:36] <AzureGale> @CappuccinoGuil What if I don't like the way I look :p
[2:43:39] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I remember how Reddit seemed to despise this game because it wasn’t just L4D3
[2:43:51] <%Nekros4442> yeah actual weapon builds in this game are great
[2:43:53] <tlflordhand> yeah melee in this game is sooo much better than L4D
[2:44:11] <tlflordhand> esp considering you can use the combat knife even whilst carrying crates n shit
[2:44:22] <dawarw0lf> bug
[2:44:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @CappuccinoGuil You have a point but...why does every game have a Paige lol. Show me a game that has a chubby black man from chicago and sure, I'll play myself lol
[2:44:24] <%Nekros4442> quick scope sniper or 100% accurate hip fire lmg. Melee weed wacker shits great
[2:44:27] <dawarw0lf> yep
[2:44:38] <%DukeMoose> DukeMoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Diversify your card deck to optimize the zombombos. keep up the good content pat and paige!
[2:44:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> @CappuccinoGuil @AzureGale that's for a therapist to unpack LUL
[2:44:56] <dawarw0lf> my favourite build is a doom slayer shotgun build
[2:45:12] <+Dakuu75> does this game have an FoV slider?
[2:45:12] <%Nekros4442> theres also max move speed builds for speed runs
[2:45:25] <DracaenaLeaf> she does lol
[2:45:28] <Major_Lee_> You can make a deck that turns the game into l4d with no ads, infinite ammo pistols, and no sprint
[2:45:30] <%dekkitout> @TurtlesAndTentacles Right? Like the only game I know that'd let me play a pan-afro support role is overwatch
[2:45:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TurtlesAndTentacles you know what, fair point, we need more characters like that in games.
[2:45:50] <Explodincatz> sounds hot
[2:45:59] <+Grayhammatter> hot
[2:46:10] <%shurtal> bluma sheddy
[2:46:11] <xxshadowxx416> olny in the south
[2:46:28] <+TheBitingIrish> Machetes aren't supposed to be sharpened tho, yeah?
[2:46:32] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @dekkitout Lol damn that is hellaa specific and I wanna see more of that in games now
[2:46:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @TheBitingIrish Why wouldn't you sharpen a blade?
[2:47:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @CappuccinoGuil Here's hoping it isnt an EA game! I dont wanna monkey paw this one lol
[2:47:11] <+TheBitingIrish> Idk, somewhere I read machetes are more like axes
[2:47:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> You sharpen axes too
[2:47:23] <%SWFanatic> birdie
[2:47:44] <akitanito> oh no flesh towers

[2:47:48] <cs0402196> paige
[2:47:57] <+TheBitingIrish> I mean obviously you'd sharpen it at some point but it's not supposed to be like cleaver sharp
[2:48:00] <KaitlynnHere> Purge
[2:48:03] <+gantz_zero> literal Stopping Power
[2:48:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> I like these characters, but the Vermintide 2 conversations where so much fun.
[2:48:33] <cs0402196> Flesh Ansible's
[2:48:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> The sharper an edge the easier it cuts, it means you have to put in less effort on your swing.
[2:48:54] <dawarw0lf> Bullet stumble is a thing that can help deal with specials
[2:48:57] <akitanito> and then someone scares burds
[2:49:12] <%shurtal> you mean umbilical cord
[2:49:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> You mean umbilical cord?
[2:49:20] <causewaybob> Hey dudes just wondering how the game is is it worth buy ?
[2:49:44] <tlflordhand> it is if you have a dedicated squad to play it with
[2:49:46] <dawarw0lf> @causewaybob its worth playing with gamepass
[2:50:01] <Qu1ckyyy> Back 4 Bloodborne
[2:50:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dawarw0lf oh shit, it's on gamepass? For PC?
[2:50:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> See everyone, if you leave standing water, it'll become sustenance for a horrifying meat placenta. Be sure to dump your plastic pools when not in use.
[2:50:39] <+gantz_zero> man i love Snatcher
[2:50:45] <%MidnightBurst12> he squish

[3:01:21] <Grimlock_Master> get it on game pass
[3:01:27] <%cvp5127> what broke
[3:01:28] <@Velyndra> The negative reviews are cause "its not 1 for 1 of l4d" or "i want campaign vs"
[3:01:28] <+Grayhammatter> seems like a good time
[3:01:28] <isolex_> does it dethrone l4d2?
[3:01:28] <%SovPho> @Velyndra consider telling pat you can nuke birds with nades
[3:01:29] <%SWFanatic> hi back

[3:02:27] <akitanito> just because you're moving out doesn't mean you should start destroying the place

[3:02:30] <+WeLucklessJacks> HAHAHAHAHA
[3:02:31] <%vivaldiva> no door is safe
[3:02:31] <@ssjklyco> So it took 1 day to break a door?
[3:02:35] <+Havictos> @Velyndra I've seen it like maybe 3 times so far
[3:02:37] <MaybeFalco> did the door have a picture of a skeleton on it?
[3:02:41] <TehMud> The doors with Alarms have a Sign saying DOORS HAVE ALARMS
[3:02:53] <%dekkitout> The telesto of doors
[3:03:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige FULLY channeling Han Solo, there
[3:03:13] <+Grayhammatter> come on-uhhh
[3:03:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you remove all of the doors, there's no doors to break. HahaThink
[3:03:31] <tlflordhand> Paige door support service
[3:03:39] <+Das_Prints> There’s also a higher chance of a Hag spawning.
[3:03:45] <Jogsy29__> isnt there also a chance of Hag on fog?
[3:03:50] <Jogsy29__> i fucking hate those shitheads
[3:03:59] <MaybeFalco> chauffeur but for poop doors
[3:04:00] <%Logoth_> MooMMMMM~ How could you Shoott meee
[3:04:22] <dawarw0lf> Hag's are best enemy design and look wise
[3:04:27] <huskarl_zap> punch the minigun then jump off it
[3:04:43] <MaybeFalco> once again, your survival is.... down to the wire
[3:04:47] <Jogsy29__> Hags are insta kill and hard to fuckin kill whch makes them scary as fuck
[3:05:01] <+Das_Prints> Hag’s are funny in that they’ll just tail you the whole level but won’t do anything else if you don’t shoot.
[3:05:12] <+Das_Prints> If you don’t shoot them*
[3:05:25] <dawarw0lf> @jogsy29__ but a simple is a flags bang can stop then from eating you
[3:05:45] <akitanito> that spit is really damaging
[3:06:07] <rosemon5001> yes stay in the goo for extra dmg paiUnknown sfhLAUGH Kappa
[3:06:09] <Jogsy29__> the problem is, my rando team freaksout whenever they see a Hag and they fuckin shoot recklessly and startle tme lmao
[3:06:14] <dawarw0lf> the retch's spit is so much worse then spitters
[3:06:27] <zombifiedtoast> what difficulty they runnin?
[3:06:27] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:06:37] <alternatecoyote> Spit hurts but not like L4D2 spitter goo, which ramps up the longer you’re in it
[3:06:40] <+Das_Prints> @dawarw0lf you can also save your self with Evangelo’s passive, a stun gun, and the breakout card I think.
[3:06:48] <akitanito> I don't like how they are spitting from beyond fog distance
[3:07:05] <Jogsy29__> Has anyone pass act one on nightmare?? shit is nuts! i can't even pass trail of blood
[3:07:08] <+Das_Prints> Yeah Retches have insane range.
[3:07:23] <tlflordhand> @Das_Prints It does that if you get the corruption guard that makes them worse
[3:07:30] <tlflordhand> *card
[3:07:39] <+Das_Prints> Some people have but I personally haven’t. The meta from the Reddit seems to lean towards speed running builds.
[3:07:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> Do the characters in this call the zombies ACTUALLY zombies?
[3:07:53] <dawarw0lf> @alternatecoyote that's the point tho. retch spit hurts a lot immediately while spitter goo doesn't
[3:08:03] <CosmicApe13> great answer
[3:08:06] <vonmaultke> LUL
[3:08:07] <akitanito> he's actually correct lol
[3:08:08] <Kaji04> yes

[3:08:10] <%dekkitout> Alrightm but what is a League?
[3:08:11] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's 1.3 kilometers Patrick
[3:08:12] <%afronooch> But how many feet are in a mile?
[3:08:12] <Jogsy29__> i barely made it to veteran, i beat it, but, it took me a week
[3:08:13] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:08:16] <rosemon5001> @akitanito i mean what can you expect im sure they saw those spitter impossible shot vids cant wait to see what a shitshow versus will be

[3:08:29] <isolex_> FREEDOM UNITS
[3:08:34] <%hereiam407> Nice
[3:08:35] <AMajorTom> 5280 ft EZ
[3:08:36] <AngryAsian5> Fahrenheit ew
[3:08:38] <+twenty112> It does NOT make more sense
[3:08:39] <Kaji04> celsius makes way more sense honestly :y
[3:08:40] <isolex_> KKona
[3:08:42] <DomunDomunDomun> It makes zero sense.
[3:08:51] <%Felhad> but its 1.609 km to a mile
[3:08:52] <cs0402196> inb4 she says 5 tomatoes
[3:08:53] <xxshadowxx416> best is freedom
[3:08:54] <DomunDomunDomun> 0 freezing, 100 boiling makes sense.
[3:08:55] <%Logoth_> Dont you like the M1 Garand
[3:08:56] <%SovPho> That one's not bolt action
[3:08:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> HOW is fahrenheit easier, Paige?
[3:09:02] <senfood> M1A1 ia semi0auto
[3:09:02] <%MelBrooksKA> M1A is semi auto
[3:09:03] <akitanito> freedom meters
[3:09:04] <%hereiam407> You guys dont understand 3 feet to a yard?
[3:09:04] <+JonathLP> 1.6
[3:09:08] <anAngryHamster> Celsius is shit. Put zero at absolute zero or get the fuck out of my face
[3:09:08] <+Das_Prints> The M1A is semi-auto
[3:09:08] <vonmaultke> Fahrenheit < Celsius pvpSass
[3:09:08] <%SovPho> m14 is semiauto
[3:09:12] <%baka_sugoi> Hot or Cold very simple
[3:09:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, did Pat say 2.2 KM? Because it's 1.6
[3:09:22] <%SovPho> You can do some clever swapping
[3:09:25] <%Felhad> he super did
[3:09:38] <+Das_Prints> They are apparently planning to add a card that lets you swap attachments. Going by the dev Trello.
[3:09:38] <+ThomasOfTroy> @CommanderSqueaks "Pat is wrong", news at 11
[3:09:46] <Jogsy29__> OH SHIITTT
[3:09:46] <xxshadowxx416> the m14

[3:10:17] <%hereiam407> Thats awesome

[3:10:23] <%MidnightBurst12> oh damn
[3:10:25] <dawarw0lf> you can't crown a hag
[3:10:35] <akitanito> bot is just aggroing her lol
[3:10:35] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:10:38] <SpellCatty> Is that the equivalent of a witch
[3:10:40] <+Das_Prints> She’s blind. She will just walk to gunshots and follow you all level.
[3:10:41] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a fucking lungfish
[3:10:42] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:10:43] <Jogsy29__> worst combo -Snitch/Hag and fuckin spitters
[3:10:44] <%baka_sugoi> K I S S
[3:10:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> A mile is 1.6 KM, not 2.2
[3:10:45] <%hereiam407> Great job bot
[3:10:48] <%Logoth_> The hag appears janky
[3:10:48] <+Havictos> The hag is female therefore Paige must kill
[3:10:48] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Damn, this game is more “Legally Distinct ‘Left 4 Dead’” than I thought!

[3:10:57] <%dekkitout> @CommanderSqueaks I think he meant 2.2 pounds per kilogram
[3:11:03] <%AncelDeLambert> LINDA, PLAY NICE!
[3:11:08] <dimensaur> Hagbagging
[3:11:08] <rosemon5001> AI talking to eachother LUL
[3:11:09] <cs0402196> where firecrackers?
[3:11:10] <%hereiam407> Do you have to keep moving? Is it a distance to hear thing?
[3:11:12] <Jogsy29__> yeah this is copyright free L4D hahah
[3:11:12] <+Das_Prints> I love the wild mouth arms. Such a freaky design.
[3:11:12] <TheHeroAppears> @WaitHowDidIGetHere same devs
[3:11:16] <+Havictos> @WaitHowDidIGetHere Well it's not like Valve was going to give it to us
[3:11:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CommanderSqueaks So he converted miles to kilograms? LUL]
[3:11:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> ** LUL
[3:11:26] <%SWFanatic> But how weighs more a kilogram of feathers or a mile of metres?
[3:11:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Save us Kojamara!
[3:11:40] <huskarl_zap> Haussy
[3:11:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Jogsy29__ isn't this made by the same people?
[3:11:47] <%dekkitout> @CommanderSqueaks Or pascals to lux tajC
[3:11:48] <dawarw0lf> some say kill her so she stops following you
[3:11:49] <%hereiam407> Lord she comin
[3:11:56] <Jogsy29__> @CappuccinoGuil  It is!
[3:12:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> good shit
[3:12:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Look out, Kojamara and Gogglor are fighting!
[3:12:24] <%hereiam407> Nice
[3:12:31] <+Havictos> can the minigun take her out
[3:12:32] <+Das_Prints> With the right melee build you can stunlock her from 100% to dead if you do it right.
[3:12:36] <%The_Protagonist> pro gamers
[3:12:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> What weighs more Pat, a kilogram of miles or a pound of kilometers?
[3:12:40] <%hereiam407> Ah Psychonauts
[3:12:55] <ZE_Count> is game good pat?
[3:12:55] <+SilverDevilfish> Botvangelo with the teleport shot
[3:12:57] <dimensaur> botvangelo with the teleport
[3:12:58] <dawarw0lf> her health is half of the breaker so its possible to kill her
[3:13:23] <vonmaultke> that Bot bungie cords back to the group and its great in a stupid way
[3:13:29] <Jogsy29__> Breakers are the easiest boss, they're dumb. i;ll take them over a hag or ogre
[3:13:33] <+Das_Prints> @havictos it could but they would need to set up a good distance away and the person on the gun should not short her first otherwise she’ll eat the gunner before they drop her.
[3:13:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach "Will stabbing the Hag upset them?"
[3:13:51] <%hereiam407> That seemed easy
[3:14:01] <rosemon5001> what are the chances there is rule34 about the hag allready?
[3:14:04] <outofbonelesswings> they're on rec
[3:14:16] <%AncelDeLambert> "Don't poke the bear." "Poke the bear?" "DON'T poke the bear." "Poking the bear."
[3:14:20] <cs0402196> lord, you don't kill hag?
[3:14:21] <+Havictos> in front of the door pat
[3:14:23] <Jogsy29__> there is only for Holly LMAO haha
[3:14:36] <%The_Protagonist> @hereiam407 this game seems easier than l4d in general (unless they are just on easy difficulty?)
[3:14:48] <%hereiam407> Maybe
[3:14:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Put the barb wire in front of the door" proceeds to put it in the middle of the room.
[3:15:15] <dawarw0lf> @the_protagonist if you don't have good builds or a team its harder then l4d
[3:15:15] <Jogsy29__> this game is easy on recruit but the difficulty spike from Veteran and nightmare are fuckin enourmous and fucked
[3:15:16] <sirrice77> @hereiam407 they're on easy, apparently the difficulty really jumps as you go higher
[3:15:19] <%hereiam407> Its was in front
[3:15:21] <Jogsy29__> like holy shit
[3:15:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> They are called "Ridden"?
[3:15:26] <tlflordhand> No. They're just on ez dif and havent amounted much of any corruption cards
[3:15:28] <+Das_Prints> @the_protagonist They are on the easiest difficulty out of three. Veteran and Nightmare are very tough and require good deck builds and teammwork to get through or you’ll die a lot.
[3:15:29] <outofbonelesswings> they're on recruit the difficulty is incredibly raised with the other two
[3:15:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, Pat, a mile is 1.6 KM.
[3:15:37] <%hereiam407> Lets get wet
[3:15:46] <%AncelDeLambert> reading the reviews, large enemies have atendency to be bullet spongey on higher difficulties
[3:15:54] <Jogsy29__> like the diffculty spikes on level are fuckin 200 percent
[3:16:17] <HyperionXV> Oh this level with the mineshafts
[3:16:18] <%hereiam407> Jesus loved a shotgun
[3:16:21] <%chance_h> I like hearing the dog snoring
[3:16:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dog snores to negate the hor-ror
[3:16:42] <+Das_Prints> @anceldelambert they can be. The counters are usually you have someone be a dedicated special killer either through a explosives build or by building up weakspot damage for snipers and shotguns.
[3:16:42] <MittensBroadcast> how the game pat
[3:16:50] <%dekkitout> @AncelDeLambert That seems to be a blackhole of a standard for shooters now
[3:16:57] <Jogsy29__> like first level on veteran, they will send you hordes of tall bois
[3:16:58] <%hereiam407> Snor-or
[3:17:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> It doesn't matter, but I just noticed: the boards they were putting up were wood, where did this sheet metal come from?
[3:17:11] <+Das_Prints> With the right setup you can drop most specials in 1-3 shots.
[3:17:31] <dawarw0lf> the difference on difficulty is a 50% damage buff on recruit and 15% more health on nightmare plus damage against you is increased. build and teams can make easy and normal fine
[3:17:41] <+Das_Prints> Of shotguns and snipers specifically.
[3:17:47] <+TopTieramisu> shrek?
[3:17:52] <%AncelDeLambert> so this is the type of game that you really oughta start out on Easy, huh?
[3:17:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's not ogre until it's ogre.
[3:18:01] <%AncelDeLambert> how clear is it that class builds are a thing?
[3:18:06] <dawarw0lf> yes
[3:18:08] <%hereiam407> Thats a cool ogre
[3:18:09] <%AncelDeLambert> WOAH that's a big man, baby!
[3:18:10] <Jogsy29__> i've seen most builds using the healing shotgun card. Has anyone use that??
[3:18:16] <%The_Protagonist> oh that's a pretty great design
[3:18:18] <dimensaur> he's got layers
[3:18:20] <tlflordhand> ogre way ezer than breakers
[3:18:32] <%hereiam407> He's a ogre this game
[3:18:44] <%ThirdWelles> ThirdWelles subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Pat! Been getting super into Metroid lore after playing Dread (my first one), and oh boy, Other M's Ridley panic attack scene is even MORE stupid with the context that Samus had canonically killed him five separate times by that point in the timeline.
[3:18:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Ladies and gentlemen, weighing in at 2000 pounds, ten ounces: EL GIGANTEEEEEEE!
[3:18:54] <akitanito> nice save
[3:18:56] <dawarw0lf> @jogsy29__ its bad right now as one pellet kills a common keeping you from getting more
[3:19:05] <+Das_Prints> @anceldelambert it’s recommended you play through on recruit and unlock cards and learn the campaigns. Then you start on Veteran. In Vet calling hordes is an actual huge threat. I’ve matched with parties that wipe on the first levels many times on Vet.
[3:19:09] <tigerfang86> he do be bussin
[3:19:13] <%The_Protagonist> ogre bussy
[3:19:24] <%Logoth_> The birds dont care about the ogre??
[3:19:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> AND HERE I AM STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU
[3:19:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> Birds aren't real
[3:19:26] <Jogsy29__> i always go ridden killer card, that's soo useful against ogres then True grit and berserker cards
[3:19:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @ThirdWelles there's truly no excuse for it, it's amazing how much Sakamoto didn't give a fuck despite having total control of the project
[3:19:40] <akitanito> this is hilarious
[3:19:42] <isolex_> is there a push?
[3:19:42] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[3:19:51] <+TopTieramisu> as the devs intended
[3:19:56] <dimensaur> he's bugged Kappa
[3:20:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AncelDeLambert I don't think it's so much that he didn't give a fuck as he had no clue what people actually liked about Samus.
[3:20:13] <%AncelDeLambert> @Das_Prints now is it recommended by the game, or is this a community recommendation? Just trying to get a feel for how the game communicates
[3:20:18] <EntropyArcade> At the end of this street check the cross-street sign @PatStaresAt
[3:20:23] <Estuko> trying to watch this nand play project zomboid is a rush. the difference in survival chance vs quantity of zombies is madness
[3:20:26] <Jogsy29__> Breaker has this fornite storm around them where of u go out of their area, ur gonna die lmao
[3:20:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @CommanderSqueaks "Why is she purple?" is a pretty clear message of "does not give a fuck at all" to me
[3:20:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Samus only speaks once in Dread, but there's more characterization in that game for her then the entirety of Other M, and it's ALL body language.
[3:21:03] <+Havictos> @ThirdWelles It's set up like it's supposed to be her first time out and that's dumb
[3:21:09] <rosemon5001> how is pat of the ball clan enjoying killing zambos?
[3:21:13] <EntropyArcade> good horror homage back there for anybody else whos playing
[3:21:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AncelDeLambert Samus' suit has changed color in multiple Metroid games.
[3:21:34] <+Das_Prints> @anceldelambert A bit of both but more the community. Although their labeling of the difficulties is bad since  it says Recruit gives reduced supply points to Vet which leads to people thinking vet is the default difficulty when starting out and then getting destroyed.
[3:21:40] <%AncelDeLambert> but he didn't know what the Gravity Suit is, is my point
[3:21:41] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> “Pharmaceuticals in this location!”
[3:21:42] <Profmcstevie> Characterisation is in action and reaction, nothing matches Prime 2 Samus who just hand waves away a species she saved and a planet she annihilates
[3:21:44] <tigerfang86> oh god
[3:21:56] <%hereiam407> Its gross as hell
[3:22:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @Das_Prints thnx man
[3:22:17] <+Das_Prints> This game has some real meaty environments later on.
[3:22:20] <akitanito> hide in the bathroom
[3:22:20] <%The_Protagonist> amgry
[3:22:21] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> bro im eatin dood, get out of that house quik
[3:22:29] <%dekkitout> This house is a damn party cave
[3:22:50] <%SWFanatic> Everybody do the botangelo wiggle
[3:22:55] <huskarl_zap> lol
[3:22:56] <+Das_Prints> @anceldelambert no problem dude. Vet’s a good bit of fun once you get the hang of it though.
[3:23:07] <%The_Protagonist> lmao pat just shootin and stabbin friends
[3:23:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game's turned into Outlast 2.
[3:23:19] <%dekkitout> Still cleaner than most frat houses
[3:23:19] <%Happypig329> pat is the game good
[3:23:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Botangelo is getting revenge for being murdered last time.
[3:23:54] <vonmaultke> He tweaking
[3:23:57] <+Das_Prints> Another tip is on the higher difficulties the default bash is usually better than the knife. Since the bash hits crowds and the knife hits one target at a time.
[3:23:57] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> that bot is freakin out
[3:23:59] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Androidelo
[3:24:01] <Profmcstevie> That dude is shaking enough to provide infinite energy

[3:24:25] <JobbedBone> well, he is a bottom...
[3:24:31] <%Logoth_> Botvangelo is bugging the fuck out

[3:27:32] <+Das_Prints> Ah yes. The mines.
[3:27:40] <XoftheTITANS> this part was tough, we did it with no pipe bombs
[3:27:43] <+Grayhammatter> that's the do it
[3:28:00] <%BogBodyPositive> oh nooooo everyone dies here
[3:28:12] <%Logoth_> and just pump in more gas
[3:28:24] <dawarw0lf> they should all have barrels in front
[3:28:33] <Jogsy29__> we did this hard, infinite spawn on one cave and  we fuckin hard as well on it
[3:28:39] <dawarw0lf> Its dumb that they don't
[3:28:53] <%BogBodyPositive> run Pat!
[3:28:54] <+Das_Prints> @dawarw0lf Sometimes they don’t have barrels. At that point you either ignore it or spend and explosive to close it.
[3:29:03] <+Das_Prints> Oh my bad I get what you meant.
[3:29:12] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> "we keep going"
[3:29:14] <akitanito> lol
[3:29:15] <vonmaultke> LUL
[3:29:18] <%Valdorick> LUL
[3:29:19] <Profmcstevie> it did not fly true
[3:29:19] <+TheBitingIrish> There are barrels next to most

[3:29:33] <+chiazam> I kinda saw that coming
[3:29:34] <dawarw0lf> @das_prints its very hard and honesty impossible to run past those hoards
[3:29:41] <cs0402196> aliwayGun
[3:29:48] <%twistedj3ster> It's not her fault, someone put a wall in her way
[3:30:00] <%BogBodyPositive> eyeballs
[3:30:08] <%Nekros4442> Yeah knife really sucks in those situations
[3:30:11] <+lordericter> wow PAt got shredded there
[3:30:15] <%Nekros4442> Can only kill 1 and not knock em all back
[3:30:21] <+chiazam> wow that was a lot of damage
[3:30:31] <+Das_Prints> @dawarw0lf yeah. I thought you meant they always have barrels. I misread.
[3:30:44] <+Grayhammatter> flew true that time
[3:31:09] <Estuko> Could you compare this game to L4D1/2 or is its mechanics/system something too different?
[3:31:10] <%Logoth_> Get the mugnum
[3:31:23] <dawarw0lf> @nekros4442 yeah combat knife is hot garbage
[3:31:43] <Profmcstevie> Always remember The Director, use your stuff and it'll spawn more
[3:31:49] <GeneralHysterics> heavy attack is so good with the base punch
[3:31:58] <tlflordhand> false, the knife is really good with the right complementary cards
[3:32:04] <dawarw0lf> @estuko Its left for dead/killing floor/rouge light game
[3:32:06] <GeneralHysterics> punching heads off shoulder, it's great
[3:32:08] <+Das_Prints> @estuko due to how the builds work in this game it’s much more teamwork focused. But it’s still has that core of fighting hordes while navigating a level like L4D has.
[3:32:08] <+TheBitingIrish> Heavy melee should be standard, not a card
[3:32:10] <JobbedBone> :D
[3:32:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Estuko deerbiJAM
[3:32:34] <Estuko> @dawarw0lf @Das_Prints ahhh gotcha, ty ty.
[3:32:41] <akitanito> wat.
[3:32:41] <Estuko> @CommanderSqueaks hello
[3:32:42] <%SWFanatic> oh
[3:32:42] <%BogBodyPositive> yeaaaaaaaaaaaa wait wat
[3:32:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Das_Prints I think the fact that special zombies are only ever NPCs also changes things a lot.
[3:32:50] <BitOSalt> lol wait till act 3
[3:32:51] <+Das_Prints> High end melee builds get nutty.
[3:32:52] <marvel877> CLIP THAT AUDIO
[3:32:56] <BitOSalt> act 3 takes years
[3:33:00] <Jogsy29__> why hasnt been a chainsaw in this game?? Chainsaw would be fuckin helpful in this game
[3:33:05] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I also doubted razor wire
[3:33:05] <+TheBitingIrish> Is this mission still bugged with piddly spawns?
[3:33:08] <%BogBodyPositive> No I freaking love razor wire when upgraded
[3:33:11] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I shouldn't have doubted it.
[3:33:19] <dawarw0lf> @thebitingirish nah I hate that card. it ruins my speed melee build
[3:33:32] <BitOSalt> razor wire plus melee build equals professional blender
[3:33:42] <tlflordhand> white razor wire is pointless however
[3:33:54] <+Das_Prints> @commandersqueaks yeah. Part of it is they can double up and have more than 4 specials at once. Which can be good and bad depending. High difficulties get kind of unfair with the spawns sometimes.
[3:34:02] <%shurtal> Vel is cool, and he's here to say, buy razor wire, it's pretty great
[3:34:16] <Jogsy29__> razor wire is useful on horde holding, but if ur against army of Tall bois, they just walk over it
[3:34:31] <%BogBodyPositive> more ammo?
[3:34:40] <+Das_Prints> Breaker also destroys razor wire.
[3:34:42] <BitOSalt> this part can be done in just a couple minutes if done correctly. good thing they have vel
[3:34:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Das_Prints There's also only so many ways a CPU can react. When the specials were also players, you had this perpetually escalating META that was pretty fun.
[3:34:54] <tlflordhand> @Jogsy29__ yeah, it is not useful on nightmare, bangs are more so
[3:35:14] <+Das_Prints> @commandersqueaks That makes sense.
[3:35:33] <JobbedBone> tower defense?
[3:35:33] <Parapattern> Racer Wire
[3:35:39] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:35:44] <%baka_sugoi> LUL so much
[3:35:47] <Dova573> oh so like the daysgone
[3:35:49] <akitanito> look at this slinky playground
[3:35:51] <%BogBodyPositive> this is awesome
[3:36:01] <%GarbageNirvana> I ended up doing this without razor wire with my folks cause none of us could figure it out
[3:36:03] <+smackbear> genitals: destroyed from razer wire
[3:36:04] <%The_Protagonist> weird that it doesn't hurt you guys lol
[3:36:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Got past it tho
[3:36:08] <%BogBodyPositive> 360 BAYBEEEE
[3:36:18] <Estuko> use your bloons tower defense skils to win
[3:36:18] <+Grayhammatter> that looks trash, but holy shit will it work LUL
[3:36:23] <dawarw0lf> YOU CAN GET IN THR TRUCK
[3:36:23] <Jogsy29__> imagine if u can upgrade barbwires to fucking spike fences,
[3:36:39] <%Infernal_Dalek> BRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[3:36:40] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:36:44] <+Das_Prints> If you bring a high use speed build to this you can clear this part so fast. Like under a minute 1:30.
[3:36:44] <tlflordhand> HMV =/= truck LUL
[3:36:56] <+Havictos> That sound does not match that rate of fire
[3:37:01] <+Grayhammatter> EZ
[3:37:07] <studleydoorite> Heavy Man Vehicle
[3:37:09] <akitanito> the power of razor wires
[3:37:10] <BitOSalt> are they playing on recruit?
[3:37:10] <Jogsy29__> on Veteran i belives it's 10
[3:37:12] <%Logoth_> Theres no time
[3:37:14] <%The_Protagonist> lmao
[3:37:15] <%baka_sugoi> F R E E
[3:37:21] <tigerfang86> yaaaaaaaaay
[3:37:22] <Mister_McDerp> easy peesy
[3:37:24] <AngryAsian5> CLOSED
[3:37:26] <MrGreenToS> On Vet a boss spawns in as well
[3:37:33] <dawarw0lf> an ogre spawns on higher difficultys
[3:37:40] <akitanito> gg
[3:37:47] <%Nekros4442> Now you get the rest of the character unlocked
[3:37:51] <+Das_Prints> Last mission on Act 3 is brutal on Vet.
[3:37:51] <+chiazam> how many acts are there?
[3:37:53] <tlflordhand> In the beta that level was bugged to hell and was ez even on nightmare
[3:37:57] <%The_Protagonist> you're all free now
[3:38:02] <Jogsy29__> Act 2 isn't bad, Act 3 is where the shit really hits the fan
[3:38:07] <tigerfang86> Character timeeeeeee
[3:38:11] <+Havictos> sweet validation
[3:38:12] <Jogsy29__> specially that endless gate hallway
[3:38:14] <Jogsy29__> FUCK THAT
[3:38:34] <tlflordhand> @chiazam 4
[3:38:55] <%Nekros4442> The bottom one is melee
[3:39:04] <+Das_Prints> @jogsy29__ the only way I was able to clear that section was by leaving razor wire behind us as we gained ground so we weren’t swarmed from both sides constantly.
[3:39:27] <Jogsy29__> @Das_Prints everyone should bring shit tons of pipebombs on it
[3:39:35] <Jogsy29__> that's the only way we passed it
[3:39:35] <+NiktenKing> Cross trainer card is most bang for your buck
[3:39:42] <+Das_Prints> It’s so rough. Also yeah that works too.
[3:39:43] <tigerfang86> Hoffman's got big pat energy
[3:39:47] <BitOSalt> Holly Blender go Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[3:39:54] <%NateyBeak> hoffman looks like a dad i know who leaves fox news on all day
[3:39:57] <Rionxgarland> hoffman is john goodman from the big lebowski
[3:39:58] <Jogsy29__> one sarcrificial mini gun and a runner
[3:40:03] <akitanito> offensive inventory
[3:40:03] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Hoffman is cool!!!
[3:40:05] <tigerfang86> in high difficulties you need A LOT of ammo
[3:40:14] <BitOSalt> Hoffman and Karlee are great for beginners too
[3:40:16] <+Das_Prints> Extra ammo is super useful.
[3:40:17] <Jogsy29__> Hoff man is Guillermo del toro haha
[3:40:20] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig GUN n psaBig AMMO
[3:40:24] <CrazyMedicine> LUL

[3:40:28] <tigerfang86> Big Pat energy
[3:40:28] <MrGreenToS> Hoffman has chance to find ammo when he kills zombie
[3:40:33] <%Logoth_> Hoffman is that guy from Black Lagoon
[3:40:34] <softbirby> He's voiced by Rigby
[3:40:36] <outofbonelesswings> hoff also gets a free extra nade slot
[3:40:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> How is More ammo not good in agame where you shoot?
[3:40:44] <+Havictos> what does the E-girl do
[3:40:46] <+Das_Prints> He’s a big ol’ dweeb conspiracy theorist.
