[0:11:56] <Them00n> Action figures was a marketing term invented to sell dolls to boys.
[0:11:58] <+TheOpinionater> Define dolls
[0:11:58] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> It's the same thing with wargame people and their toys @AngriestPat

[0:15:16] <FoulNightingale> ITS NOT GREAT
[0:15:16] <%axellogic> NO SUPRISES
[0:15:16] <+WhyIDie> it looks like it was quickly modded from their single player engine
[0:15:17] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> 200 MB ON THE DISC
[0:15:17] <+omegasis> its ok, they got a cheat engine Kappa
[0:15:17] <$NocturneNovember> 50GB day one patch, @AngriestPat
[0:15:18] <%GarbageNirvana> What I saw looked like FO4 but there's othe rpeople
[0:15:18] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat THe Pc version is riff with cheaters.
[0:15:19] <captainthunderwolf> YOU CAN FIGHT MOTHMAN

[0:15:26] <+Harawanagangsta> big terrible
[0:15:27] <%Baesel20xx> to be fair Metacritic is a cess pool
[0:15:27] <+KaizenChaos> naked and fisrs
[0:15:28] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat its not looking great
[0:15:29] <deviljhojho94> FUCK GOD COWARD AND FUCK FALLOUT
[0:15:30] <AnacondaVirtue> It's real bad
[0:15:30] <+Khozza> Big Yikes
[0:15:32] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> 50gb LUL
[0:15:32] <%Remery_> But Big Sloths
[0:15:33] <%Baesel20xx> but its also bad anyways
[0:15:33] <Dapper_Cactuar> it's the beta with microtransactions added
[0:15:34] <Ropcord> it's a good game you fuckin degenerates
[0:15:35] <+MrZouichi> It looks like Fallout 4. So it looks old.
[0:15:35] <CptBritches> Giaant Bomb were streaming it earlier and Jeff straight up said "I don't like this game"
[0:15:36] <%WTFOliver> its another Bethesda Cant Make a Game Studios so I dont know what people expected
[0:15:37] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat it is not a Fallout game. It is also not a very good game either.
[0:15:37] <kamen_advent> Is the game that everyone expected to be bad really that bad? It's always worse
[0:15:37] <captainthunderwolf> @bit_guardian But it's got BIG SLOTHS
[0:15:38] <KitsuneSidhe> @AngriestPat It's holding my computer hostage!
[0:15:41] <+GreenJudgement> its Fallout 4 online. F4 was boring and didn't change shit... so ehh
[0:15:41] <$floridianman> It looks good if you have a beefy PC
[0:15:44] <Monsterstalker74> 2.8 PogChamp
[0:15:44] <%umbypokochan> I just want a sequel to Oblivion
[0:15:45] <$NocturneNovember> 2.8 on Metacritic so far, WOOF
[0:15:47] <KitsuneSidhe> And not in a good way
[0:15:47] <%Remery_> Not even giant sloths can save it
[0:15:48] <+Foobe> I like it
[0:15:48] <%BeefyQueefer> I think Fallout 76 has gotten universally below 3/10 on metacritic on all versions
[0:15:48] <Pixel_Butts> finally! i caught one of your stream!
[0:15:50] <JJMR322> it'll be fine in a year or so. like no mans sky
[0:15:52] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Mobile bad? D:
[0:15:54] <knomad2b> it's basically rust
[0:15:55] <bit_guardian> I'd rather play as the sloths.
[0:15:57] <Angry_Ev1L> It's like sea of thieves but without sea or thieves

[0:16:06] <reiju_22> it is
[0:16:06] <Twitchypyro> Rusty Nukelford.
[0:16:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Kotaku was talking about how it got review bombed
[0:16:10] <Twoiis> How did Alfredo take to Warframe?
[0:16:11] <DracaenaLeaf> It is released on metacritic, but only user reviews

[0:17:03] <$SGrim> @kamen_advent other then today's stream, there's been surprisingly little.
[0:17:03] <%topendbuzz> ONLINE
[0:17:05] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> And that was a SELLING POINT
[0:17:05] <mark1247> @AngriestPat pat will you ever stream FURI? please ok
[0:17:05] <knomad2b> i love having an rpg with no plot

[0:17:18] <+ghostravens> ngl, i would have preferred another single player fallout even if it was like fallout 4 than fallout 76
[0:17:18] <+redanimator> so u can't hurt their feelings
[0:17:18] <+deity_majora> Can't disable players from attacking you either
[0:17:18] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> @AngriestPat there's also big micro transactions and an 18 dollar skin
[0:17:18] <+WhyIDie> so many bugs, par for a bethesda game, but no modding community to help atm
[0:17:19] <$GohanEgret> rip big puss
[0:17:20] <desertpunk247> The beta is shit too
[0:17:20] <%Remery_> the Flop
[0:17:21] <%mitchteck> When is Elmo gonna be on the game awards
[0:17:22] <CptBritches> Yeah, Giant Bomb were streaming it and really didn't like it. It seemed incredibly empty. Also you can't change the color of Pip Boy
[0:17:23] <%crowsloft77> or make them unkillable?

[0:17:37] <+PenmanLupine> @Tomschiii I mean people that play warframe on PC cause that game was made for people with crab legs for fingers. Dude its fine your fingers will have a use one day. I'm sure there is someone on the internet that'll find them attractive. You'll do it one day! You'll go big and be huge strong with those creepy hands. k then lul
[0:17:39] <RCtiger0> Isn't your podcast a sponsor?
[0:17:42] <+Quigsies> Fallout died after New Vegas
[0:17:42] <Nekros4442> BIG BOY MICROS
[0:17:44] <+Golinvoxx> woh did pat move?
[0:17:44] <captainthunderwolf> I wouldn't even buy MY OWN skin for 18 dollars!
[0:17:45] <%Baesel20xx> But also part of that money goes to creators
[0:17:46] <%Baesel20xx> so
[0:17:46] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> 76 is 60 dollar
[0:17:48] <deviljhojho94> Christ
[0:17:49] <cerberuscarmine> the games super free
[0:17:50] <$floridianman> Its fun if you have friends but if your a looser like me...
[0:17:52] <+Timesteel> there are Npcs but they are all robots
[0:17:52] <%Harawanagangsta> theres a good 12 minute video breaking down why 76 is very bad and not worth anyones time for any reason
[0:17:52] <Randomguyioi> I'm ready for QUADFISH
[0:17:53] <cerberuscarmine> AND free updates
[0:17:56] <caja_de_ojos> I LOVE MY HAT
[0:17:56] <+SuichiTanaka> I'm sad Tennogen is all so expensive. It makes it hard to get into it.
[0:17:57] <+deity_majora> 2.4 - 3.0 user Score on MetaCritic @AngriestPat
[0:17:57] <PunishedRaccoon> @AngriestPat there is no fov slider in fallout 76
[0:17:58] <%Faustgesicht> $18 skin in what game?
[0:17:58] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> go with it
[0:17:59] <BinaryBetrayer> Install disk downloads 50gb and it only has like 200mb of files in it.
[0:18:01] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> $7 green screen
[0:18:02] <%OceanGovernor> Was that a copy pasta?
[0:18:04] <deviljhojho94> every game is fun with friends tho
[0:18:04] <%BeefyQueefer> @AngriestPat did you know that Fallout 76's anti-cheat only consists of a file search for cheatengine.exe?
[0:18:05] <%Remery_> @AngriestPat IS there new Pet to get?
[0:18:06] <+MarshallLee67> fo76 @Faustgesicht
[0:18:06] <+deity_majora> depending on version
[0:18:07] <Twitchypyro> Thats quitter talk -TF2
[0:18:08] <+PenmanLupine> @AngriestPat your hats in Warframe cost way more than $7
[0:18:09] <%SaltyDongs> HAT
[0:18:10] <%MagickBurritoh> 76 might as well have been $76
[0:18:11] <WizardofWazz> MUH H A T
[0:18:11] <Champine> Hats with Pat
[0:18:12] <%Faustgesicht> oof
[0:18:13] <%Divryne> No it didn't.
[0:18:13] <@PeachSaliva> @rctiger0 other way around, kiddo
[0:18:14] <Nekros4442> I forget but has Pat or any of the best friends gotten into Path of Exile?
[0:18:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> no
[0:18:15] <Angry_Ev1L> MTX in full priced games are gross
[0:18:16] <Ropcord> no LUL
[0:18:17] <%ECRead> MERCH? PogChamp
[0:18:17] <cerberuscarmine> MY VALKYR IS MY BABY
[0:18:17] <%mistymntns> Wait is Warframe just TF2 in space?
[0:18:18] <+humbelpie> Also there is no cheat protection so you can freely edit files in Fallout 76 and get away with it
[0:18:19] <Hydrapissed> poop town 76
[0:18:20] <FoulNightingale> It doesnt
[0:18:21] <+terracornholio> consolized
[0:18:23] <+PenmanLupine> @AngriestPat neither game had an FOV slider
[0:18:24] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> nice
[0:18:24] <%rpg_lux> FOV screws with the HUD!
[0:18:27] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> Theres also only 200 MB on the bluray for physical, with 100 gb patches
[0:18:28] <captainthunderwolf> They were gonna add the FOV slider to an NPC, but unfortunately...
[0:18:28] <%Divryne> Creation Engine games have never had FOV sliders.
[0:18:29] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Pat has drops PogChamp
[0:18:29] <$floridianman> nice
[0:18:29] <mark1247> yo @AngriestPat pat will you ever stream FURI? please
[0:18:29] <FoulNightingale> Fallo8ut 4 needs INI tweaks for FOV
[0:18:30] <Hydrapissed> 69 69 noice
[0:18:31] <jmazouri> fo4 doesn't have a fov slider because bethesda can't into first person animations properly
[0:18:32] <+Bk138> Congrats on buying a house! PokPikachu
[0:18:32] <caja_de_ojos> yup
[0:18:32] <+WhyIDie> someone found a way to change the FoV, and it caused the UI to clip into the world geometry @AngriestPat
[0:18:34] <+Timesteel> muh $7 cape
[0:18:37] <CappuccinoGuil> is this a bad time to announce Loopy Lore's special golden rustic box limited edition for 18 extra dollars? Kappa
[0:18:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Fo76 has NO CHEAT PROTECTION
[0:18:40] <@Mechz71> thank me
[0:18:41] <Ropcord> i bought the fuckin chroma prime accessories why did you get me back into this game pat
[0:18:46] <Kaitepaints> @peachsaliva I need a huuuug, I had the bad day
[0:18:47] <%Remery_> Is there any new pets in Warframe? @AngriestPat
[0:18:48] <BinaryBetrayer> Do fallout players even know what a Water Chip is anymore?
[0:18:49] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat fov fucks up the visuals, and frame-rate messes with in-game speed. Bethesda quality is super.
[0:18:50] <%Harawanagangsta> you have to set the fov in console and then lock it in ini files
[0:18:52] <Tomschiii> @penmanlupine i am starting to feel being trolled here with my fingers
[0:18:52] <Angry_Ev1L> Bethesda said there's no FoV slider cause they wanted for the game to feel alive... or some dumb shit like that
[0:18:53] <Dapper_Cactuar> it's badly scaled FOV based around power armor from what I hear
[0:18:55] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> they need it LUL

[0:32:56] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat I realized way too late that when I said Jehuty, I meant anubis. I suppose you could make Volt Prime a decent Jehuty, but until I see my virtual on knock off shit in warframe, no Jehuty just yet.
[0:32:56] <+TheOpinionater> rdr2 slows down super hard in the 2nd half

[0:35:00] <%shin_garbage> Paige just ask Liam and he'll tell you everything in about an afternoon
[0:35:01] <%Schadenfrauleinn> @TheBrazilianHope it's better Destiny
[0:35:03] <%FrostMass22> The Darkness 2 is great
[0:35:03] <Jman409> SHE DOESN’T NEED FRIENDS ANYMORE
[0:35:06] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> YOU CAN DO IT JUST BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART
[0:35:07] <+TheHeroNobodyNeeded> @legendfather_of_giants i'm glad someone got it
[0:35:09] <CaptainKarite> They're gonna touch the controls in KH1 and say "this was a mistake"
[0:35:15] <%seaearthandsky> its the shoot bangs
[0:35:17] <+drakthebest> Horde shooter would be more accurate, loot shooter implies you pick up loot which really isn't the case
[0:35:18] <+TheBrazilianHope> PogChamp Space ninja shit
[0:35:24] <Ropcord> you're gray fox in the hallway
[0:35:28] <%Gogogolem> I need the guns!
[0:35:29] <+AmericanaRed> I hope woolie is playing KH
[0:35:30] <Daxalog> Warframe is not a LOOT shooter. You get shit al l for actuall usable loot. All the actual meaningful items are locked behind long times and late quests.
[0:35:30] <+TheOpinionater> Its a game where you roll in the air or youre too slow
[0:35:31] <+Ssaik> also has some surprisingly good story shit
[0:35:32] <%Remery_> Does it have gigantic slappable asses?
[0:35:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @TheHeroNobodyNeeded the SBFP community has a surprising amount of overlap with FGO
[0:35:34] <%AncelDeLambert> making the gun the SUPER GUN
[0:35:38] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Doll game PogChamp
[0:35:40] <blackbaron98> yup

[1:44:52] <Malziel> THAT DRILL IS SO GOOD
[1:44:55] <AsterBodhran> N E W M I N I N G
[1:44:55] <Zombrocom> Best drill
[1:44:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Fortuna needs different drill to get anything good
[1:44:57] <%konekoryugamine> apatWrong
[1:44:57] <CertainlySyrix> I hope Pat doesn't miss the guys on the second floor.
[1:44:58] <%flying_man_3> the mining is so much better now!
[1:44:59] <+Nephthyz> @AngriestPat Get that drill, you can mine the high level gems and stuff in cetus with it.
[1:45:00] <Malziel> that's 'cause it is
[1:45:00] <%Baesel20xx> god the mining is so much better
[1:45:01] <+forevern2dust> Is Pat feeling better?

[1:45:05] <+Flightedwings> New mining is best Mining
[1:45:05] <feralknights> The drill he sells will get you some Vallis-specific gemstones and stuff, but you CAN use your Ostron drill
[1:45:05] <+Jay667b> Fortuna is definitely an improved Cetus
[1:45:09] <+MarshallLee67> it's the best drill in the game- you literally won't need to get the highest level cutter from cetus if you get that @AngriestPat
[1:45:10] <Ropcord> that drill just completely blows out the ostron ones
[1:45:11] <+petros_ichorus> you're gonna need near-maxed rank to finish garuda
[1:45:11] <+FloorBurger> Canada is now interested in soil...for reasons.
[1:45:13] <+Cybercobra2> gems are like the best way to get fortuna standing
[1:45:15] <+Jsaru> ah crap I missed the second floor stuff
[1:45:15] <+Cobalt_Racer> @AngriestPat that is the top tier mining laser, better than the top rank one in cetus
[1:45:17] <%BoarQueen> BEST BOY THURSBY
[1:45:17] <%paranetpatron> That drill is far better than any others and hunting for the Bizz is the best way to farm rep.
[1:45:18] <+SparkAfterDark> If you put "phile" on the end then it doesn't mean you Like something. It means you wanna FUCK that thing. This guy is a geophile. He's going to fuck those rocks.

[1:57:33] <Xgwill222> @reonome if that was the case, why would you have kids if they would just inherit your issues? That'd be so selfish
[1:57:36] <+Thorn14> INFINITE LAUNCHER Kreygasm
[1:57:37] <feralknights> YEAHHHH there it is.
[1:57:40] <%knomad2b> can;t you skate here?
[1:57:43] <Twoiis> Flying? How cute.
[1:57:44] <+Thorn14> gotta unlock it
[1:57:45] <Rada150> what planet should get open world next my money is either on mercury or mars
[1:57:46] <+BeatH7> odonata LUL
[1:57:49] <$SleepyMaribo> WHY IS SKELLMO SO WELL DRESSED???
[1:57:49] <feralknights> @knomad2b You need a plank first
[1:57:51] <+Cybercobra2> shhhh @knomad2b
[1:57:52] <MC_GigglePants> @knomad2b once you finish this quest
[1:57:53] <Endocrom> I need a heart, a human heart. Got a lot of blood I need to pump out of my basement.
[1:57:56] <+Grayhammatter> you can also skateboard
[1:58:05] <Malziel> shhhh
[1:58:06] <reonome> @Xgwill222 because the world is a terrible place
[1:58:07] <%knomad2b> thanks chat, hyped to see it
[1:58:13] <%flying_man_3> it huge!
[1:58:14] <+Thorn14> Yeah Venus is heug
[1:58:14] <%BoarQueen> BIG MAP
[1:58:15] <+Cybercobra2> YEA THE VALLIS IS BIG
[1:58:18] <KoyaMusa> TEMPLE OF PROFIT
[1:58:21] <Ropcord> YUGE
[1:58:21] <+Jay667b> Thematically it should be Eris the infested planet Rada150 but they do tend to put the open worlds near newbies so you may be right
[1:58:21] <$floridianman> 4x as big as planes
[1:58:23] <+AcidicHorizon> a big boy
[1:58:28] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> I hope you had an Itzal Archwing pat
[1:58:30] <%knomad2b> streams choppy
[1:58:35] <+Grayhammatter> temple of proofit
[1:58:36] <+AcidicHorizon> sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby
[1:58:37] <%flying_man_3> yeah it slows a bit
[1:58:38] <Twoiis> My PC chugs this :(
[1:58:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat notice archwing is infinite
[1:58:40] <%Wallabri> fortuna big
[1:58:40] <$sassyquatch963> it's trying
[1:58:42] <+Cybercobra2> @AngriestPat note the 4 blips next to your minimap, those are important
[1:58:43] <%MagickBurritoh> very unoptimized area
[1:58:44] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> maybe not
[1:58:46] <Inebriateddonut> Cuz it's a new update
[1:58:47] <%flying_man_3> its fine
[1:58:47] <+AcidicHorizon> It does that on load in
[1:58:47] <Croetec> stream is fine
[1:58:48] <+NWR_James> Warframe isn't slowing down, time is speeding up
[1:58:48] <AlasterAngelo> better uninstall it
[1:58:49] <+Thorn14> Dont worry
[1:58:49] <Ropcord> they're still ironing out the bugs
[1:58:49] <+Tylermcd93> It isn't choppy
[1:58:50] <BlackTribal> yeah, this place kinda demands a bit
[1:58:51] <+FloorBurger> Soon on Switch!
[1:58:52] <+BaronEgo> Vallis's performance is inconsistent as hell for a lot of people
[1:58:53] <valdorick> @Xgwill222 You're not thinking scum enough. YOU the debt holder doesn't want a kid... but if there's planned birth by the debt holders...
[1:58:53] <%badmr7> Yeah its still a rough right now
[1:58:54] <LabTech41> So basically, the purpose of the hunger factory down there is to turn the normally hellish heat into a frozen wasteland?
[1:58:54] <Rentixx> might be choppy just for a bit
[1:58:55] <%topendbuzz> I think its the game
[1:58:57] <Ropcord> PC is basically the beta LUL
[1:58:59] <Apolonm> is good
[1:59:02] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> @AngriestPat It happens on my stream too, It was a lot worse a few days ago
[1:59:04] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> They're working on fixing it honestly
[1:59:04] <grayjammer> YEAAAHAAA SETTINGS TIMEEEEE
[1:59:06] <AbnormalEnd> @AngriestPat turn off v-sync
[1:59:09] <+Ssaik> d e l i c i o u s
[1:59:10] <N1netbattler> big map is big
[1:59:12] <+Thorn14> The Power House of the Spores.
[1:59:12] <%Remery_> yum yum
[1:59:13] <%d00msdaydan> mitocardia is the powerhouse of the orb
[1:59:15] <+SparkAfterDark> It's the powerhouse of the cell!
[1:59:16] <$KnivesEve> running better than when i go to venus
[1:59:17] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Yeah you need to mess around with it. MY performance is fine but I see a LOT of people saying otherwise
[1:59:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat turn off dynamic lighting
[1:59:19] <%knomad2b> oh god, i forgot this was gonna run on a switch
[1:59:23] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> NO PLZ
[1:59:24] <+PatEarthGod> not right nooooooow
[1:59:25] <$floridianman> not optimized yet we are beta testing for console
[1:59:27] <%skelet0njazzwizard> >4K
[1:59:27] <%flying_man_3> if Pat turns of V-Sync he dies
[1:59:32] <Twoiis> It's fine for now.
[1:59:33] <$MightyMaxT> Can you believe the Pat-Platinum thing was less than a year ago? It feels so much longer to me
[1:59:34] <+tussletoes> The evil is defeated.
[1:59:35] <+Thorn14> apparently switch version helped optomize console versions
[1:59:37] <+NWR_James> the only change?
[1:59:39] <%AncelDeLambert> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[1:59:43] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @knomad2b At a hard 30fps though so it's not all bad
[1:59:45] <%AncelDeLambert> him space screm
[1:59:49] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Thorn14 it helped all verisions
[1:59:50] <+Grayhammatter> if you turn off Vsync, you die for real
[1:59:52] <CertainlySyrix> Did you ever try turning off Color Correction Pat? i think the game looks much better without it on.
[1:59:54] <+Eclipse_knight_> @angriestpat turn down the particles
[1:59:55] <feralknights> @AngriestPat Follow the circle, it'll narrow down the longer time goes on and point you in the right direction
[1:59:58] <+AcidicHorizon> left
[1:59:59] <+dickbuttwoman> You passed it
[2:00:02] <+Ell1ot> they made it so snow builds up on your frame if you stay outside for awhile
[2:00:04] <%Remery_> Even in space Elmo doesn't stfu
[2:00:08] <+Thorn14> Welcome to Venus
[2:00:09] <+AcidicHorizon> right
[2:00:10] <+WhyIDie> throbbing mushrooms, even
[2:00:11] <Twoiis> innuendo
[2:00:12] <+Thorn14> It'll kill ya
[2:00:13] <+SparkAfterDark> This place is Morrowind
[2:00:13] <N1netbattler> its up
[2:00:13] <$superorangerobin> That's what she said
[2:00:16] <+tussletoes> V-sync is like that friend who says he's helping but he's just eating all the food in your fridge.
[2:00:16] <+Dobster4221> use your ears pat forsenS
[2:00:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Bounties have bonus objectives now
[2:00:17] <Ropcord> the fish are advanced space roombas
[2:00:19] <N1netbattler> behind you
[2:00:20] <+Thorn14> yeah this is basically Cold Morrowind
[2:00:24] <+Cybercobra2> yea this whole place is artificial orokin bullshit
[2:00:24] <CertainlySyrix> It's Morrowind but with snow instead of ash.
[2:00:28] <thatsocrunchy> LUL LUL LUL
[2:00:37] <+Thorn14> Powah
[2:00:38] <%BoarQueen> power hungry boy turns to crime
[2:00:40] <+RushUnplugged> they terraformed Venus TOO MUCH and now it's cold
[2:00:40] <Ropcord> GOOD PLAN BUD

[2:00:43] <myninjaway_> What is this game

[2:00:47] <AsterBodhran> f
[2:00:49] <+Thorn14> LUL
[2:00:49] <+AcidicHorizon> MUCKING
[2:00:50] <%SiameseSneeze> I love how the Corpus look here
[2:00:50] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat turning Anisotropic Filtering off completely and Colour Correction are the best ways to improve the framerate on Fortuna
[2:00:51] <Ropcord> OOPS
[2:00:54] <%knomad2b> @The_Lady_Alustriel yeah i bet it's playable then. i'd personally have a hard time with the twitchy gameplay at a lower frame rate, but that's just me
[2:00:56] <+Thorn14> MUCKERS
[2:00:59] <+Grayhammatter> mucker...
[2:01:01] <%BoarQueen> WHOOPS
[2:01:06] <+LogothX> Can anything in this game hurt you?
[2:01:08] <+kuervojones> Too many mutha muckers, mucking with your shit
[2:01:08] <Ropcord> THIS IS A CHRISTIAN STREAM WATCH THE LANGUAGE
[2:01:11] <Rentixx> Muckers sandwiches.. Mmmmmm
[2:01:13] <+tussletoes> @LogothX He's Inaros, so, no.
[2:01:13] <CertainlySyrix> I didn't know Color Correction hit the frames too, I just thought it looked better.
[2:01:14] <Graywolf_the_45th> uh oh spaghettios
[2:01:17] <Worldbrand> Color correction isnt intensive but it will turn off the Loki Piss Filter
[2:01:20] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @knomad2b I'm going to play it anyways just as a lark but I really don't know how it will play with Joycons
[2:01:25] <+dickbuttwoman> Motion blur is the worst
[2:01:26] <+dickbuttwoman> whyyyyyyyyy
[2:01:27] <%thunderdutch> just turn off color.
[2:01:27] <%Baesel20xx> Turning off color correction also helps with tracking critters on vallis
[2:01:35] <$floridianman> Maybe turn down particles
[2:01:37] <+SparkAfterDark> Ludicrous is such a funny setting.
[2:01:37] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> lowering particles will help a bit as well
[2:01:41] <+Thorn14> I'll have to do that at home when I get home
[2:01:41] <%Remery_> tweak the nips
[2:01:42] <+ravenrooke> Did Pat move?
[2:01:44] <+tussletoes> But color correction is so nice!
[2:01:46] <+ravenrooke> new background

[2:01:47] <Ropcord> monkaS

[2:01:48] <+Grayhammatter> ludicrous particles
[2:01:54] <%flying_man_3> yeah that would do it
[2:01:56] <+SWFanatic> turn down for what
[2:01:58] <DomunDomunDomun> >motion blur on
[2:02:01] <Rentixx> Ohh wait, they're called Smuckers not Muckers
[2:02:01] <+RushUnplugged> imagine Pat not playing at 4k!
[2:02:01] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:02:01] <%skelet0njazzwizard> HOW THE HECK IS YOUR FOV SO LOW
[2:02:02] <%knomad2b> @The_Lady_Alustriel could be good if they get gyro aiming in there. i'd play it just for that

[2:02:29] <%BoarQueen> good save
[2:02:29] <%MrTickleTrunk> Smooooth
[2:02:31] <%skelet0njazzwizard> Put your FOV to 78
[2:02:33] <Ropcord> nailed it
[2:02:34] <%tiishi> smoooooooth like butter
[2:02:34] <%knomad2b> much better
[2:02:35] <$floridianman> Jesus what kind of PC do you have
[2:02:37] <N1netbattler> lol
[2:02:37] <+Striderhoang> We’ll be right back
[2:02:38] <+Grayhammatter> pat wants his VSync
[2:02:38] <RahuStalker> ludicrous particles aren't even bad lul
[2:02:38] <$RaikenTB> Shoulda got that 2080 instead of a house.
[2:02:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat prob turn vsync back on
[2:02:43] <+FloorBurger> Welcome back to Pat Plays With His Knobs
[2:02:43] <Djinnazz> It's blue again.
[2:02:44] <+jishjoshjash> DE should make this stream have in-game drops. Also good evening.
[2:02:44] <%skelet0njazzwizard> Womp womp
[2:02:45] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @knomad2b hmm yeah that might not be bad. Otherwise I think the joycons are simply too small to use effectively. Switch Warframe is probably going to be a slow slow experience
[2:02:49] <%skelet0njazzwizard> it's not real FOV I swear
[2:02:50] <+TheEvaFreak> It's vertical FOV
[2:02:52] <%skelet0njazzwizard> UP
[2:02:54] <%BoarQueen> in display
[2:03:00] <%MagickBurritoh> forbluena
[2:03:02] <Worldbrand> Last time he fucked with the FOV he just changed it back
[2:03:02] <+Dobster4221> no but pat, itll make our experience better. we dont care about yours Kappa
[2:03:04] <%flying_man_3> christ 65? that s low
[2:03:07] <+Thorn14> its liar FOV
[2:03:10] <FairOnFire> You can just say TV. We'll understand what you mean
[2:03:12] <%skelet0njazzwizard> It just pulls camera back It's weird
[2:03:16] <Ropcord> LUL
[2:03:17] <+irrationalsound> hey yall, just got home from work, whats going on?
[2:03:19] <+Thorn14> Oh no es bueno
[2:03:21] <EASrake> No?
[2:03:22] <Inebriateddonut> No u
[2:03:24] <+WhyIDie> that feels bad to watch on the stream
[2:03:25] <cerberuscarmine> no u
[2:03:25] <CertainlySyrix> don't mess with FoV on a television
[2:03:27] <+Cybercobra2> big no
[2:03:28] <$floridianman> 1
[2:03:30] <CertainlySyrix> keep it for the monitors
[2:03:33] <%skelet0njazzwizard> Hi, I'm pat and I don't like seeing enemies on my screen
[2:03:36] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Yeah I was gonna say thats a tv thing feels great on my monitor
[2:03:37] <cerberuscarmine> COWARD
[2:03:39] <xoyv> pat tryin to fiddle faddle with the settings for maximum smooth
[2:03:41] <$RaikenTB> @irrationalsound Change your name color to purple. it's important.
[2:03:44] <+Thorn14> Calm down chat
[2:03:51] <%BoarQueen> yes
[2:03:52] <+emperri> one third of his screen is his back Pepega
[2:03:53] <shadespiral> Calm down? In a Twitch chat?
[2:03:53] <%Baesel20xx> I mean its water
[2:03:59] <+Grayhammatter> it's basically water
[2:03:59] <+Dingalow> FOV is bad, man
[2:04:00] <%flying_man_3> frames cant swim dum dum
[2:04:00] <%thunderdutch> big yes
[2:04:03] <Ropcord> what you should actually do is change your name to blue and then say you changed it to purple
[2:04:07] <+AcidicHorizon> Purple mans unite
[2:04:14] <+Thorn14> its fiiine
[2:04:16] <+WhyIDie> #teampurple
[2:04:21] <$floridianman> oww my eyes
[2:04:21] <+Dobster4221> WutFace
[2:04:25] <+waterbuddy16> lmao that framerate
[2:04:26] <+AcidicHorizon> hm
[2:04:28] <+jisang0415> blue mans unite
[2:04:29] <+Thorn14> Oh we cinematic now
[2:04:32] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> this is a big yikes
[2:04:34] <%tiishi> it really is struggling huh
[2:04:35] <+AcidicHorizon> PURPLE NAMES UNITE
[2:04:36] <+tussletoes> How the hell does this game run better on my shitty "gaming" laptop?
[2:04:37] <+Bupkis7> Doesn't struggle on my computer
[2:04:38] <Worldbrand> Probably.
[2:04:39] <+showmeyourmango> 4K fortuna is too strong
[2:04:39] <%BoarQueen> i'm glad it isn't just my shit machine that drops frames so hard
[2:04:40] <$RaikenTB> It's called Warframe for a reason Kappa
[2:04:40] <+Thorn14> Prob
[2:04:41] <KangarooCyborg> prepare...for ludicrous speed!
[2:04:42] <haisho> LUDICROUS PARTICLES
[2:04:42] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> most likely
[2:04:43] <PanicSwytch> UNITE
[2:04:45] <%tiishi> maybe
[2:04:47] <acridPaladin> Cetus was the same way on launch
[2:04:48] <%FrostMass22> purple forever
[2:04:50] <+XSchwingerX> Why is your character so purple?
[2:04:50] <+Thorn14> lower Effects maybe
[2:04:50] <+Bupkis7> Probably because of the stream
[2:04:53] <CertainlySyrix> Maybe try turning down Particles?
[2:04:53] <%Baesel20xx> I mean maybe but its also a little rough in general right now
[2:04:53] <+PatEarthGod> might be partially because of the stream
[2:04:54] <$floridianman> nah its just unoptimized as shit
[2:04:55] <+tussletoes> Like, the Vallis runs far better than Cetus BY FAR -- must be the streaming
[2:04:56] <+CoffeeAndComputers> what resolution are you playing at?
[2:04:56] <Inebriateddonut> Well yeah but also it's a new update
[2:04:57] <%flying_man_3> I'm so glad they do this as number of kills instead of a boring def like on Cetus
[2:05:03] <+RushUnplugged> OOF
[2:05:04] <+SparkAfterDark> That's the name of my new band. Ludicrous Particles
[2:05:05] <wired_soul> luda!
[2:05:06] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Film Grain DansGame
[2:05:10] <+Asiveni> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[2:05:14] <AbnormalEnd> from what i can tell its mostly the cap on framerate
[2:05:16] <mylesmoore> fortuna eats RAM like a beast too
[2:05:23] <AbnormalEnd> and vsync
[2:05:25] <+SparkAfterDark> It's to make the game cinematic
[2:05:26] <+XSchwingerX> Shadows always makes the biggest difference in framerate
[2:05:28] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Bulletstormmmmmm
[2:05:30] <Clyderso> Time to dab on the options menu.
[2:05:33] <%skelet0njazzwizard> is your framerate uncapped?
[2:05:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat They nerfed the main quest b/c it was fucked
[2:05:37] <+Cybercobra2> to be fair this is on venus, the second planet
[2:05:44] <KangarooCyborg> They nerfed the framerate
[2:05:50] <+irrationalsound> @RaikenTB like this?
[2:05:52] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Mine was chugging but i noticed my anti-virus was running @AngriestPat
[2:05:53] <+tussletoes> They were like level 20-30 before they patched it to make it easier for beinngers (Fortuna gave the game a LOT of new players, so... bear with it)
[2:05:54] <%skelet0njazzwizard> see if removing framerate fixes it?
[2:05:58] <%flying_man_3> no they just nerf certain enemies
[2:05:59] <%skelet0njazzwizard> limit*
[2:06:03] <%thunderdutch> I'll nerf your framerate. <3
[2:06:06] <GoldeNOVA> Main quest really wasn't hard
[2:06:07] <$floridianman> so I did the fucked version? it was ezpz
[2:06:10] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat turning off all Anisotropic Filtering has been confirmed to help framerates a lot
[2:06:10] <+Thorn14> wow you play Inaros very differently from mine, I just pocket sand and stab people.
[2:06:11] <+YabbaTroll> @AngriestPat when you can you should equip helios to scan all the new enemies
[2:06:13] <%BoarQueen> fortuna wasn't that hard before the patch, but they did tone it down some
[2:06:18] <+Aleate> I died 3 times in one of the quest on the first day with my sortie character LUL
[2:06:21] <+emperri> they nerfed certain enemies and also, additionally, they nerfed this quest
[2:06:27] <CertainlySyrix> Helios scanner isn't working on the new enemy types for me. @YabbaTroll
[2:06:29] <shadespiral> @tussletoes I'd understand doing that if you were required to play in the Orb Vallis to progress through the planets, like with the Plains.
[2:06:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> @BoarQueen dual sword fuckers were a nightmare
[2:06:37] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Main quest wasn't that hard for us with fully built frames and weapons, but for your MR2 Excalibur it's a rough time
[2:06:42] <+Thorn14> Back in the...troubles...
[2:06:46] <%flying_man_3> Helios wasnt working at first but has been lately
[2:06:47] <%BoarQueen> @legendfather_of_giants nidus renders all enemies impotent
[2:06:49] <+Cybercobra2> look at all these delicious new enemies
[2:06:51] <$gozzojt27> i hope one day DE puts in a benchmark for warframe
[2:06:54] <+YabbaTroll> @CertainlySyrix odd, it seems to be working for some people and not others
[2:06:54] <FackinCrazy> SHEs tsun tsun
[2:07:00] <%skelet0njazzwizard> Dang man, you need an itzal archwing
[2:07:03] <Archmortal> pro tip: framerates above 144-ish bug out the board so it cancels its own grinding
[2:07:04] <%SiameseSneeze> I took my Oberon Prime and had no problem
[2:07:06] <$floridianman> fun fact thats not the sun its a giant mirror
[2:07:06] <Ropcord> JUST PRESS 2
[2:07:08] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat I has been confirmed that petting the baby increases the framerate
[2:07:12] <haisho> reminder that there was an Opticor Corpus that was denting your health a bit
[2:07:13] <Ropcord> YOU HAVE FLARES
[2:07:14] <$sassyquatch963> i love the new archwing launcher
[2:07:15] <CertainlySyrix> It worked on the fish. @YabbaTroll LUL
[2:07:24] <mylesmoore> or they could just optimize the open world portion so it doesn't eat 2GB worth of memory
[2:07:27] <$MightyMaxT> Wait....Warfames can fly?! Man, I haven't gotten in there AT ALL then
[2:07:28] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> no Itzal evoKO
[2:07:30] <+YabbaTroll> @CertainlySyrix wtf, mine doesnt do that LUL
[2:07:30] <+SparkAfterDark> Elmo the baby stole my frames
[2:07:31] <MC_GigglePants> only if pat pets the baby tho
[2:07:32] <%skelet0njazzwizard> OH SHIT IT'S NOW AT 10000 FPS
[2:07:32] <valdorick> So many frames
[2:07:42] <xoyv> goodbye elmo prime
[2:07:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Opticor enemy was so fucked he could oneshot you
[2:07:50] <CertainlySyrix> If I pet my dog will he shit out a 1080ti?
[2:07:50] <%BoarQueen> delicious sludge
[2:07:51] <$superorangerobin> Frame Rate is locked to the frequency of his purrs
[2:07:52] <Ropcord> yaaaay sludge
[2:07:52] <+Ssaik> spores and sludge
[2:07:56] <Flyrant> oh snap I haven't played warframe in a while. How is the new update?
[2:08:01] <+TootPirate> @mylesmoore that's what they've been doing in the past two hotfixes
[2:08:02] <+Grayhammatter> delicious sludge
[2:08:08] <+emperri> YIKES
[2:08:12] <Ropcord> FORESHADOWING
[2:08:16] <FXEvolution099> If you turn off High Shader Quality, the framerate should increase somewhat
[2:08:20] <+Nephthyz> What's lucre?
[2:08:28] <+emperri> lucre are filthy things
[2:08:32] <+Thorn14> THE BIZ
[2:08:34] <Zombrocom> Lucre = old timey word for money
[2:08:37] <%BoarQueen> get hype for THE BIZ
[2:08:38] <Zombrocom> wealth

[2:09:00] <Ropcord> ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT
[2:09:02] <Zombrocom> Biz is the best
[2:09:03] <$RaikenTB> Can you pet your pet in game?
[2:09:04] <BlackTribal> the heck kinda fannypack is he wearing?
[2:09:05] <xoyv> the thrill of the hunt
[2:09:10] <Clyderso> Pog
[2:09:11] <Twoiis> BIZZZZZ
[2:09:13] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> oh shit I hope Pat redeemed all that from the Discord
[2:09:16] <+SparkAfterDark> I'm going to start calling myself "the business"
[2:09:16] <%SiameseSneeze> You can pet your pet on your ship/orbiter
[2:09:17] <+Hallommig> the buisness is the strongest name to have here i think
[2:09:17] <Ropcord> biz...
[2:09:18] <+LogothX> Isnt that a wrestler's name?
[2:09:20] <+LogothX> The Bizzzzzzz
[2:09:22] <+Cybercobra2> @AngriestPat this guy was the main guy we dealt with during the fortuna ARG
[2:09:22] <Djinnazz> Mr. BizzNasty
[2:09:23] <+Dingalow> Is that a robot with human arms or a human robot parts???
[2:09:25] <$RaikenTB> @SiameseSneeze Ah.
[2:09:25] <$NocturneNovember> Miz, yeah
[2:09:25] <%flying_man_3> Little Duck is the best character hands down
[2:09:25] <$floridianman> He was into some BLACK OPS SHIT
[2:09:26] <%Baesel20xx> The NPCs in Fortuna are so much cooler than Cetus
[2:09:27] <KangarooCyborg> Give 'em the business
[2:09:29] <+Thorn14> its a human with robot parts
[2:09:30] <+Jay667b> The Miz? LogothX
[2:09:30] <BlackTribal> you're gonna have to deal with THE BUSINESS
[2:09:32] <%BoarQueen> "i used to be a RAD MOTHERFUCKER"
[2:09:32] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Hey Pat did you redeem those codes from the Fortuna ARG?
[2:09:34] <shadespiral> @Dingalow A human with robot parts.
[2:09:37] <+emperri> ryder or riot
[2:09:37] <Flyrant> that dudes head reminds me of the RaCast heads in PSO
[2:09:38] <+binkarus> holy baloney i'm actually here for a stream LIVE?!
[2:09:39] <+Thorn14> they replace people's heads
[2:09:43] <+Thorn14> and other parts for debt
[2:09:44] <$NocturneNovember> Choke me Vader, wow
[2:09:47] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> who am I kidding he ain't reading shit
[2:09:47] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Dingalow they're human's with robo parts
[2:09:47] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Biz was the focus of the ARG
[2:09:53] <+Dingalow> This game's weird
[2:10:00] <myninjaway_> I don’t understand what this game is
[2:10:03] <AbnormalEnd> Its just Garak, plain simple Garak
[2:10:06] <+SparkAfterDark> This is the plot to DMC just set further in that settings future
[2:10:08] <%skelet0njazzwizard> The biz is a cool dude, savin animals and being a badass
[2:10:11] <+Jay667b> space ninjas myninjaway_

[2:10:25] <%SiameseSneeze> myninjaway_ cyborg space ninjas with magic
[2:10:27] <+st_judge> She hides it under the couch I bet
[2:10:29] <+Grayhammatter> i mean, she basically is
[2:10:30] <MasterDecoder> @myninjaway_ Borderlands, but third person and more characters
[2:10:31] <AbnormalEnd> heh
[2:10:34] <viewtifulr> but it turns out shes eating there huh?
[2:10:35] <+FloorBurger> The bag is also trash.
[2:10:40] <+willtheprofessional> @myninjaway_ third person shooter. emphasis on fun movement and magic powers.
[2:10:49] <+Bupkis7> TEMPLE OF PROFIT
[2:10:51] <Flyrant> so did they change how melee combat works in this game? I remember the devs were talking about doing that
[2:10:56] <+GingerTwerk213> BUREAUCRACY!
[2:10:57] <haisho> IT CHANGED BACK
[2:11:00] <CertainlySyrix> Not yet. @Flyrant
[2:11:03] <%OceanGovernor> No melee 3.0 yet
[2:11:05] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @Flyrant Not yet thats incoming soonTM
[2:11:06] <Zombrocom> @Flyrant Not yet, still in dev
[2:11:08] <shadespiral> @Flyrant Melee 3.0 isn't implemented yet.
[2:11:11] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Film Grain is new
[2:11:12] <+willtheprofessional> Motion blur off would be nice
[2:11:14] <Flyrant> alright cool, thanks

[2:11:17] <Ropcord> Film grain DansGame
[2:11:20] <+PatEarthGod> LUDICROUS SPEED, GO
[2:11:22] <%Sovspot> is Warframe just a more interesting version of Destiny?
[2:11:23] <%AncelDeLambert> motion blur is always bs
[2:11:24] <%SiameseSneeze> LUDA
[2:11:26] <+emperri> LUL
[2:11:28] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> LUL
[2:11:28] <+Thorn14> D:
[2:11:28] <+Cybercobra2> film grain is just for certain quest events @Ropcord
[2:11:30] <xoyv> oh god i have no love for melee 3.0
[2:11:32] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[2:11:34] <GoldeNOVA> Remove the film grain and motion blur tho
[2:11:34] <%nitronLVIII> LUDICRUS PARTICLES GO!!!!
[2:11:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:11:36] <Croetec> that was slightly aggresive
[2:11:38] <KangarooCyborg> I want ludicrous glare
[2:11:41] <xoyv> two steps forward one step back
[2:11:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Sovspot eh, Destiny X 40k X Diablo
[2:11:52] <%BoarQueen> melee 3.0 adds a legally distinct devil trigger
[2:11:52] <+tussletoes> death to spin to win losers. i embrace death, give me melee 3.0
[2:11:58] <Rentixx> explain why that film grain is on, Pat
[2:11:59] <+allups> SECRET BEATING FOR PAT
[2:12:02] <PanicSwytch> Is paige eating wcdonals?
[2:12:05] <$floridianman> IF I CANT SEE 10 BILLION PARTICLES THEN FUCK IT
[2:12:06] <+emperri> ALRIGHT!
[2:12:06] <+allups> srry for caps
[2:12:06] <%camodikk> i still dont know enough about melee to know wtf is going on with Melee 3.0
[2:12:11] <+Cobalt_Racer> black
[2:12:12] <%nitronLVIII> ayy
[2:12:14] <%tiishi> it work
[2:12:15] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Melee 3.0 is also going to nerf all my melee weapons FeelsBadMan
[2:12:21] <+Cobalt_Racer> ayyy it not black
[2:12:23] <+Cybercobra2> Big work
[2:12:25] <Ropcord> all you need to know about melee 3.0 is that they're adding devil trigger
[2:12:26] <+emperri> banned for viewbotting
[2:12:28] <+Thorn14> It'll cause a recursion
[2:12:32] <%BoarQueen> yes
[2:12:33] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[2:12:35] <Ropcord> steve's words not mine
[2:12:37] <Inebriateddonut> yep
[2:12:37] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> A reminder that melee 3.0 WILL HAVE AIR COMBOS
[2:12:39] <Djinnazz> see what?
[2:12:39] <xoyv> melee 3.0 means you can't hit more than one object in a swing, dead bodies and physical objects included
[2:12:41] <valdorick> But I love Spin to Win :_(… at least when Spin to Win is tied to Tap pause Taptaptaptaptaptaptap wobble and not couching like I'm Teebagging for great damage.
[2:12:44] <MikeSpeezy> hello pat rick u r a dork
[2:12:46] <+tussletoes> But it's adding long-reaching attacks and higher damage to ALL melee weapons
[2:12:52] <shadespiral> Melee 3.0 was adding a "directional ground slam" also iirc.
[2:12:52] <+NWR_James> "mm"
[2:12:53] <%AncelDeLambert> so long as my slash ignis wraith still murders, I'm fine
[2:12:55] <+Thorn14> "Muh"
[2:12:59] <$gozzojt27> this reminds me of old command and conquer music
[2:13:04] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Melee 3.0 is also going to nerf all the popular melee weapons by way of nerfing Rivens so there's that
[2:13:10] <%tiishi> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[2:13:10] <+binkarus> i use mpv to stream. it's a lot better than using twitch's stream for me
[2:13:11] <+tussletoes> As a heavy blade user who doesn't want to spend on 3 mods just to swing fast enough, that sounds good to me
[2:13:15] <+FloorBurger> Thanks Elmo.
[2:13:15] <+allups> i cant wait to have a love like this
[2:13:15] <xoyv> wish my floofy cat had a floofy tail
[2:13:16] <+SuichiTanaka> Only certain weapons were viable for melee, so I hope that melee 3.0 will even the field more
[2:13:18] <+Cybercobra2> the fortuna music is great
[2:13:20] <Ropcord> NOTHIN BUT BANGERS

[2:33:24] <+dickbuttwoman> The excavator bounties need to be balanced
[2:33:29] <+FloorBurger> BIG RoboFist rise up
[2:33:36] <Ropcord> it's frozen because the orokin put giant fuckoff terraformers all over the place to cool it down and then died without turning them off
[2:33:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> I find the drops difficult to see on the snow
[2:33:39] <+dickbuttwoman> Sitting around for that long ain't fun
[2:33:39] <%skelet0njazzwizard> I swear those things are underground or something
[2:33:41] <%SiameseSneeze> or 2, whatever, i just remember more than one
[2:33:42] <OkamiDude15> give the robots gamer grip so they can rise up
[2:33:47] <+Jsaru> I always bring Carrier
[2:33:50] <deviljhojho94> If we all lift together, we can break the glass ceiling and all the groups will be free! Even the most opressed grup of them all: Gamers
[2:33:54] <+drakthebest> They nerfed the hell out of this
[2:33:55] <%knomad2b> @OkamiDude15 doodBro LUL
[2:33:58] <+Jsaru> I was too late to farm for Carrier Prime
[2:33:58] <+Cybercobra2> yea they got teleporty tech around here
[2:33:59] <+drakthebest> And yet Pat will still fail
[2:34:01] <TheAmazingClaytor> GOTTEM
[2:34:03] <CertainlySyrix> I have a hard time finding ore veins in the snow sometimes, cause it's so bright
[2:34:03] <Ropcord> haHAA
[2:34:04] <OkamiDude15> woopsEZ doodBro
[2:34:06] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @dickbuttwoman you're right. I've found doing bounties with 2 people works well as you only get 3 exvacators
[2:34:07] <+Cybercobra2> people just get beamed in
[2:34:08] <dekkitout> ice pun is ice pun SeriousSloth
[2:34:08] <grayjammer> Yea i remember doing 2 at once here

[2:34:17] <valdorick> Light blue Energy Cells on snow, nothing can go wrong with trying to locate them.
[2:34:21] <Fabric_tester> plz don't
[2:34:25] <deviljhojho94> mercy
[2:34:26] <CptBritches> Elmo thinks it was blue
[2:34:29] <+tussletoes> Solo excavation sucks so bad
[2:34:34] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 Gamers are the only group feminists don't advocate for. Coincidence??????
[2:34:37] <xoyv> valdorick, you don't even know about bad designs in fortuna
[2:34:39] <+dickbuttwoman> @The_Lady_Alustriel It should either just be 3 excavators, or two battery dudes should spawn with each wave
[2:34:46] <shadespiral> @tussletoes Unless you have Frost.
[2:34:49] <%skelet0njazzwizard> bye excavator
[2:34:50] <Ropcord> bottom text
[2:34:52] <+dickbuttwoman> @The_Lady_Alustriel waiting around for battery dudes is so shitty.
[2:34:53] <$floridianman> they beam them down so you at least kill them when they have their feet on the ground
[2:34:56] <%knomad2b> this truly is a society teno
[2:34:57] <+Solutha> i love white text on snowy landscapes
[2:34:57] <IminyourBase> don't let it set in
[2:34:59] <+tussletoes> @shadespiral Fair
[2:35:00] <+WhyIDie> pilfdroid makes them drop double the batteries
[2:35:02] <haisho> NEF TURNS ON THE JUICE
[2:35:08] <%BoarQueen> at least venus excavators scale
[2:35:09] <+WhyIDie> wide range pilfdroid can cover all of hydron
[2:35:14] <%flying_man_3> put the TP in a jar?...wtf
[2:35:14] <+Jsaru> I had issues with the UI duirng my fortuna bounties. things didn't show up and the voting screen was stuck
[2:35:15] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @dickbuttwoman An idea I saw is that leave it the way it is, but increase the amount of power granted by a battery by a whole lot
[2:35:16] <captainthunderwolf> Oh man, it's gay robot Handsome Jack.
[2:35:17] <%SiameseSneeze> I prefer Nekros
[2:35:17] <deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf Time to rise up
[2:35:23] <Zombrocom> Fuck off nef
[2:35:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> I wonder who has Nef's original body now
[2:35:32] <+dodge_and_dust> Nef is an idiot
[2:35:34] <Ropcord> this VA is fuckin great
[2:35:39] <xoyv> LITERALLY the plot to the start of anno 2070

[2:35:47] <+FloorBurger> Daddy needs his juice.
[2:35:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> I like that he acts exactly like upper management
[2:35:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> look up
[2:35:51] <BlackTribal> shut up Nef Anyo, your ticker beard fucking sucks
[2:35:52] <valdorick> I like the cave where you need to stand next to the crates to capture them, but the crates spawn such that you can't even see any of the other ones if you're in the middle of capturing one! I've NEVER failed that mission... RIP
[2:35:55] <Ersov> FAILED
[2:35:55] <deviljhojho94> me too bb
[2:35:55] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> its just encased in a big fucking statue
[2:35:58] <$floridianman> ICE BOX MACHINE BROKE
[2:36:01] <AnacondaVirtue> Eat a dick, Nef
[2:36:04] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @Ropcord didn't the VA start as just a guy in the community?
[2:36:07] <deviljhojho94> LITERALLY HUMAN RESOURCES OMEGALUL
[2:36:07] <CertainlySyrix> BUMBLING
[2:36:08] <+Thorn14> Literally every Upper Management ever.
[2:36:10] <%BoarQueen> "i didn't fuck up! you fucked up!"
[2:36:12] <captainthunderwolf> You've done a lot of quests that just end with someone suddenly dying, haven't you?
[2:36:15] <+Punisher7771> so nef is a retard?
[2:36:17] <+dickbuttwoman> This part of the quest is fucking top tier
[2:36:24] <+dickbuttwoman> Especially when you're rocking a Supra vandal
[2:36:26] <BlackTribal> you would think most people hate Alad V, but most would agree that Nef is the worst
[2:36:30] <deviljhojho94> D:
[2:36:34] <Valsunga> wlp this was fun, glad i caught a strem, gnight guys, gals and pats
[2:36:35] <+Nephthyz> Alad V is great.
[2:36:36] <Zombrocom> Nef is voiced by a real voice actor who happend to be a warframe fan
[2:36:36] <Doc1790> How long ago did Pat start the stream?
[2:36:37] <cerberuscarmine> D:
[2:36:40] <+Jsaru> Alad kinda just ran to the background
[2:36:42] <+Nephthyz> I know a girl who husbandos Alad V, no joke.
[2:36:43] <CertainlySyrix> Alad just wants to poke some corpses
[2:36:44] <+Aleate> D:
[2:36:53] <CertainlySyrix> nef wants to make money and oppress workers
[2:36:54] <deviljhojho94> Shit's fucked mang
[2:36:56] <%knomad2b> yeah the va is really strong
[2:36:57] <xoyv> do you guys know about the "we all praise" song?
[2:36:59] <Volkrotia> Futurama Brain in a jar essentially
[2:37:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> he's a CEO in charge of a company that's too big and has no checks left in a market vacuum. so yeah, he's a retard
[2:37:01] <Zombrocom> Yes
[2:37:03] <$floridianman> Old man yells at sun
[2:37:14] <+Thorn14> Brain Shelving is basically Futurama Head Jar Jail
[2:37:15] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @Nephthyz Eh he's small and a little cute plus he helps you that one time. I guess I can see it
[2:37:17] <deviljhojho94> just like reall ife
[2:37:32] <captainthunderwolf> This is the future Anarcho-Capitalists want for space. Gamers rise up.

[2:37:53] <BlackTribal> @PlagueOfGripes "I'll make my workforce more efficient by killing off my workers."
[2:37:56] <juxtest> Elmo is too good to stand up
[2:37:56] <KangarooCyborg> Nef looks like Modok fucked a light cycle from Tron

[2:39:14] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatPorgmo
[2:39:14] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @AngriestPat Everybody streaming Warframe has the drops turned on, partner or not.

[2:39:15] <NU0VA> 7,500 credinos
[2:39:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> she stole his bomb

[2:39:16] <+CoffeeAndComputers> You gave me 7.5k credits. Thanks, Pat.
[2:39:16] <+Aleate> Because technically Pat is a partner FeelsGoodMan
[2:39:16] <Zombrocom> By linking your twitch and warframe
[2:39:17] <+FloorBurger> Do it coward1
[2:39:17] <Abaddon908> watching any Streamer that plays warframe grants twitch drops
[2:39:18] <+AXL808> DE knows how to feed his addiction
[2:39:19] <+trnzero> that or the pat face
[2:39:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> the idea of stealing peoples' heads to turn them into remotely controlled workers is difficult to make even vaguely reasonable, even for sci-fi
[2:39:20] <$rdark_ksu> yup on an earlier stream i got offered a free lol helmet or something from Paige
[2:39:21] <NemokillerV> yeah I got fireworks
[2:39:24] <%OceanGovernor> I think all warframe streams get drops this opening week
[2:39:24] <Croetec> Should be Pat Face
[2:39:26] <%AncelDeLambert> no, but seriously, is this just Old World Blues? Are their brains in jars in a red dome?
[2:39:26] <valdorick> I think WF just threw you a partner, hence the "grats on Partner" thing at the start of the stream.
[2:39:27] <$MightyMaxT> So, legitamite question. Even though we see the other Warframes, there is only one in the story, right?
[2:39:29] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Become a PArtner
[2:39:30] <+Nephthyz> @AngriestPat All Warframe streamers get drops as part of this promo, you don't have to be a partner.
[2:39:30] <3InchMensch> WHERE'S MY TWO DOLLARS, SOLARIS?!
[2:39:30] <+YabbaTroll> I DONT BELIEVE IN GHOSTS
[2:39:31] <captainthunderwolf> She's literally talking to to The Punisher right now, and she's like, "Should I ask him to kill the bad guys?"
[2:39:31] <+bustawof> too bad my drops are always CREDITS
[2:39:37] <Graywolf_the_45th> I've gotten at least at least a hundred of those fucking twitch drips and still haven't gotten the free frame
[2:39:45] <42nfl19> Its anyone who streams this game
[2:39:47] <NonAddictiveSlurm> Wheres my Burrito
[2:39:49] <+Thorn14> BOOM
[2:39:50] <+Jsaru> They lost their heads casue collateral also Venus is kinda a hellhole
[2:39:52] <+omegasis> you know what's dumb tho? The fact that they rub their necks to imitate phantom pain
[2:39:54] <deviljhojho94> heh, nothing personal

[2:40:00] <+Thorn14> GAMERS
[2:40:01] <+Punisher7771> @PlagueOfGripes i know wouldent the process just kill the out right?

[2:40:08] <+skibbz_> BOTTOM TEXT
[2:40:09] <CertainlySyrix> @PlagueOfGripes it's still a little hard to believe for me. You think those might just be metal shells with brain matter stuck inside of them?
[2:40:10] <valdorick> Nef Fawks
[2:40:11] <%OceanGovernor> RISE UP
[2:40:14] <Zombrocom> That's nef's face
[2:40:14] <$floridianman> GAMERS RISE UP
[2:40:19] <+Nephthyz> @Budsoma Yes, Fortuna isn't even out on consoles yet
[2:40:19] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @PlagueOfGripes I think the real reason is that animating faces is hard
[2:40:21] <+dickbuttwoman> Walking out and just gunning down a ton of these fuckers felt real good
[2:40:21] <+bustawof> what the nani
[2:40:24] <BlackTribal> We live in a society!
[2:40:24] <$MightyMaxT> Gotcha. Thanks @Ropcord and @flying_man_3

[2:40:31] <$sassyquatch963> that's nef's face in eudico's chest cavity
[2:40:32] <deviljhojho94> SOCIETY DIES TODAY
[2:40:32] <+YabbaTroll> love that line
[2:40:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Nef, for fucks sake
[2:40:38] <+Ssaik> psychic TECH
[2:40:39] <+dickbuttwoman> In a way that, after over 1000 hours in this game, I didn't think I could feel
[2:40:40] <+Cybercobra2> we litteraly encountered a ghost
[2:40:42] <%Ninestempest> wtf is that gun
[2:40:42] <NemokillerV> Just like Woolie
[2:40:44] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> So they needed a hand-wave explanation for robot heads
[2:40:44] <+CoffeeAndComputers> Yeah but they aren't ghosts
[2:40:44] <captainthunderwolf> @CertainlySyrix It would explain how, you know, people die despite their bodies having brains outside of them.
[2:40:45] <Laecerelius> Woolie in the future when he gains cyberdreads
[2:40:47] <Ropcord> transference is a pretty major plot point, it could just be their brains are in a jar somewhere with somatics installed
[2:40:48] <GodlyLuigi> we live in a society, nef
[2:40:52] <%AncelDeLambert> the Void is still a magic wormhole, we don't know shit
[2:40:53] <Twoiis> oh he is missing it.
[2:40:54] <Zombrocom> Oh hey Paulina
[2:40:55] <$floridianman> pizza time

[2:41:08] <%Baesel20xx> But that does
[2:41:09] <loveplusearth> Hey thinking about playing warframe,am I risking being spoiled big time?
[2:41:09] <valdorick> They're not Ghosts, they're spirits, gawd
[2:41:10] <B1n0va> Time?

[2:41:19] <Ropcord> o
[2:41:19] <NonAddictiveSlurm> considering brains are mentioned and all the slave songs, the old workers were turned to futurama brains to be put into robot bodies to be slaves after death of the body
[2:41:20] <captainthunderwolf> Oh man, it's a Scarab from Halo 3!

[2:46:32] <Monkeyweed21> no it isn't
[2:46:32] <%skelet0njazzwizard> I gave this freaking tenno my board and a bomb to save us, and his ass spent 20 minutes doing flips
[2:46:32] <KangarooCyborg> Gotta get the almanac back from Biff
[2:46:33] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @knomad2b And Plains of Eidolon
[2:46:33] <Zombrocom> You can use the boards here and on the plains
[2:46:34] <Megaleg> Man warframe doesn’t know what kind of game it wants to be
[2:46:36] <+SuichiTanaka> It gets a LOT easier with practice and mods
[2:46:38] <deviljhojho94> Nah man just do it
[2:46:39] <Monkeyweed21> no you didn't
[2:46:41] <shadespiral> @knomad2b You can use the Kdrive on the Plains as well.

[2:46:47] <+Jsaru> Gotta earn that K-drive from doing sick tricks or Pearl grinding
[2:46:47] <$floridianman> So there I was doing my patrols and some 7 foot tall flesh goblin on a hover bord comes by and 360 face plants into a rail
[2:46:47] <Zombrocom> @Megaleg Warframe wants to be EVERYTHING
[2:46:49] <+Hunk_Of_Dunk> @knomad2b You can use it in both open worlds. They tried to make it usable in regular missions, but it turns out that normal maps are too small and that kinda sucks
[2:46:49] <B1n0va> raffle?
[2:46:54] <3InchMensch> Yeah, there's a mod that makes it easier to grind
[2:46:54] <NonAddictiveSlurm> raffle is a mod made census to see who to ban Kappa
[2:46:54] <captainthunderwolf> @Megaleg It wants to be a looter shooter with all of the gameplay types
[2:46:58] <%Baesel20xx> This part was kinda tough when I did it
[2:47:03] <dekkitout> "the investors are watching" tf is this guy, an ea rep?
[2:47:04] <+Striderhoang> INVESTORS ARE WATCHING
[2:47:05] <Ropcord> WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
[2:47:06] <$SleepyMaribo> the guys face is jsut a anon mask....
[2:47:07] <deviljhojho94> RISE UP
[2:47:08] <+binkarus> "What's going on? There's some kind of... sick tricks going on."
[2:47:10] <+Thorn14> Behold, the Fridge.
[2:47:11] <Ropcord> BOTTOM TEXT
[2:47:15] <Zombrocom> @dekkitout Pretty much
[2:47:15] <deviljhojho94> LIFT TOGETHER AND RISE U
[2:47:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> why is your Inaros so dark. that blue is barely visible
[2:47:18] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> @Baesel20xx tell me about it I was a level 10 Garuda LUL
[2:47:22] <%knomad2b> that's super cool lol
[2:47:31] <$floridianman> GUN TO YOUR PLANET
[2:47:32] <%skelet0njazzwizard> Do a sick flip at Nef to assert your dominance
[2:47:33] <Ropcord> plague stop he's already dead
[2:47:33] <DracaenaLeaf> NEf sounds like the sterotypical villain
[2:47:35] <+Striderhoang> More microtransactions!
[2:47:44] <+SuichiTanaka> Oh no. Plague is going to kill Pat from the inside
[2:47:45] <+Jsaru> Also that thing is fragile
[2:47:46] <captainthunderwolf> Oh god, let Pat see Plague's comment.
[2:47:46] <+Thorn14> KILL SQUADS
[2:47:47] <$serpenttucker> I really wish they came up with another bad guy corpus. It's kinda annoying that Nef is the owner of this colony
[2:47:48] <%Baesel20xx> @The_Lady_Alustriel hah yeah I was like a lvl 15 Khora
[2:47:53] <+Huderga> yo
[2:47:56] <deviljhojho94> Nef is the true identity of warframe's studio Kappa
[2:47:57] <%flying_man_3> "My kill squads" cant say that and feel like a good guy
[2:47:58] <%AncelDeLambert> this bleeding heart Tenno hacked your mainframe the last time you fucked with him, Nef
[2:47:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> I like how he has investors watching him on a TV apparently. And they're booing him. Live
[2:48:03] <Doc1790> lmao
[2:48:04] <dekkitout> glory to the investors ThankEgg
[2:48:05] <Zombrocom> Blackmail
[2:48:08] <+Grayhammatter> because terraforming is literally what made this spot
[2:48:10] <deviljhojho94> that is how investment should be done tbh
[2:48:11] <Laecerelius> Nef is Blizzard confirmed
[2:48:11] <+Aleate> Nef is like: "No investors, we need to add MORE microtransactions to Battlefront 3!"
[2:48:15] <Ropcord> he's giving a powerpoint presentation to a boardroom
[2:48:15] <+Striderhoang> All hail the investors
[2:48:22] <+WhyIDie> so nef is streaming to his investors, with future-space-ninja-twitch
[2:48:25] <+NWR_James> Bad day for the quarterly financials meeting
[2:48:27] <BlackTribal> who the hell even invests in this guy? Like, who's Nef's market?
[2:48:32] <$Niney_Who> @PlagueOfGripes My dad works at getting investors for a company and that isn't too far off what actually happens
[2:48:32] <+binkarus> He forgot the first rule of live demos: Everything fails when people are watching
[2:48:35] <@SSaryn> I finally was able to come by and I see Skelmo looking suave as fuck.
[2:48:36] <+Jsaru> Its weird he still gets investors considering he once tried to scam people with fake religion
[2:48:38] <%flying_man_3> Nefs market is other Nefs
[2:48:38] <deviljhojho94> Nef is getting donations and bits mocking him and roasting his ass right now
[2:48:45] <+Nephthyz> Would you rather invest in Nef or Alad? You have to pick one.
[2:48:46] <$floridianman> Dont you all have investors!?
[2:48:48] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @plagueofgripes its like those Kingsman conference rooms where everyone sees a tv through tje hologram camera for some reason
[2:48:49] <%flying_man_3> theres a whole group of people like him
[2:48:49] <captainthunderwolf> This Tenno is the Warframe equivalent of Punisher, and this dude thinks he has a chance.
[2:48:55] <al0nem0nster> Invest in Pat
[2:48:55] <+Punisher7771> dont you guys have coolent towers
[2:48:56] <Malziel> who doesn't love ODST drop pods tho?
[2:48:57] <+NWR_James> @BlackTribal I mean for a while people were dumping money into DogeCoin...
[2:48:57] <%Baesel20xx> ENTERPRISE AT RISK
[2:48:58] <Zombrocom> Nefs investors are The Board of the Corpus. Which are part business men part god kings.
[2:48:58] <Inebriateddonut> Grineer come in pods tho?
[2:49:06] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> hello SSaryn
[2:49:18] <Worldbrand> nefpotism
[2:49:19] <+binkarus> gamers rise up against the capitalism man
[2:49:20] <@SSaryn> apatLiz
[2:49:20] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Everyone else is dead
[2:49:20] <+Cybercobra2> big money dick
[2:49:24] <Zombrocom> Money
[2:49:25] <%AncelDeLambert> Nef cheated, duh
[2:49:26] <dekkitout> "Don't you get it Investor-chan, it's about a sense of pride and accomplishment!"
[2:49:26] <+dickbuttwoman> Probably through a hostile takeover
[2:49:27] <+Jsaru> Naw I got the Wraith weapon during that event
[2:49:28] <%Baesel20xx> By being an asshole
[2:49:29] <$Mornaka> Real estate
[2:49:30] <AnacondaVirtue> Cause Nef is pretty much the only Corpus character that isn't either dead or MIA
[2:49:37] <Monkeyweed21> Televangelist ponzi scheme
[2:49:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> Nef won Venus through sexual favors
[2:49:42] <+Jsaru> Frod Bek still exists kinda
[2:49:46] <$floridianman> Well when you killed most of the bord nef just kind of took over BOTTOM TEXT
[2:49:48] <+Solutha> Attention all Warframe gamers, Nef needs your help
[2:49:49] <$SleepyMaribo> its a fucking anon mask!
[2:49:54] <%BoarQueen> @Jsaru nah he's fucking dead
[2:49:57] <+Jsaru> Oh
[2:49:58] <Twoiis> That void key body
[2:49:59] <+Nephthyz> How's Nef gonna give anyone sexual favours in that big void key suit?
[2:49:59] <+Jsaru> shit
[2:49:59] <+Punisher7771> whene can we kill nef
[2:50:00] <Laecerelius> I thought Frod died when you sent his Ambulases back to him
[2:50:05] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @solutha wow... thats epic
[2:50:06] <+Jay667b> spinning is a cool trick
[2:50:07] <+binkarus> It's the 14th of november, so it's not an anon mask, duh
[2:50:10] <Ropcord> i hear it's a good trick
[2:50:16] <+Valison> @plagueofgripes that must be why he wears a neck brace
[2:50:20] <dekkitout> *autistic spinning*
[2:50:21] <+Jsaru> Huh didn't know that man lots of stuff happened
[2:50:24] <@SSaryn> FUCK HIM UP ANYWAY
[2:50:29] <%skelet0njazzwizard> wow 0/10 can't spin when standing on top of a spinning thing
[2:50:41] <al0nem0nster> congrats Pat, you are now the greatest contributor to Space Anonymous.
[2:50:41] <captainthunderwolf> Just go kill him anyways.
[2:50:42] <greatersea> @Laecerelius it's implied at the end of the mission that he might've had time to eject
[2:50:44] <MC_GigglePants> iit's not an anon mask cause it's literally a parody of nef's face
[2:50:48] <BlackTribal> and this kids is why you don't threaten the only people that keep your moneymaker working
[2:50:49] <@SSaryn> SHIT ALL OVER HIS MONEY AND HIS MONEY COAT
[2:50:51] <NonAddictiveSlurm> also, maybe the only timer in the game thats stopped midway
[2:51:01] <captainthunderwolf> The people in charge of all of these factions are very lucky the Tenno doesn't just decide to kill everyone.
[2:51:01] <deviljhojho94> ATTENTION ALL WORKERS, SPARKY NEEDS YOUR HELP
[2:51:03] <al0nem0nster> True, but then again Nef's face is basically an anon mask.
[2:51:03] <+SWFanatic> Goodnight Patacombs
[2:51:06] <captainthunderwolf> Because you kind of could do that.
[2:51:08] <+binkarus> Saying never forget makes him about 1 line away from being 4chan
[2:51:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> You should see Nef eat a whole pineapple held in front of his face with a string
[2:51:10] <+CoffeeAndComputers> You don't need to bullet jump literally all the time pat.
[2:51:14] <$floridianman> Nef is EA
[2:51:15] <+NWR_James> BOOO

[2:51:19] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> So Nef lives inside a Nullfier bubble right? Whats to stop us from just being Equinox and murdering him from 300 feet away through the walls of his shop
[2:51:20] <Doc1790> BOOOO
[2:51:22] <%Wallabri> BOOOOO
[2:51:22] <+BestTeaMaker> is Nef at Blizzcon?

[2:52:28] <Laecerelius> Food is temporary, Plat is forever. Until you spend it.
[2:52:31] <shadespiral> I remember that picture of a dude who looks up Diablo Immortal on the app store, but because the app is not compatible with his phone, he can't download it.

[2:52:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> Pat shoulda been on THUG 2
[2:52:49] <%nitronLVIII> Tony Hawk is kickflipping in his sarcophagus

[2:53:03] <greatersea> jumping while airborn copters
[2:53:03] <+ghostravens> Tenno Hawk Orb Vallis Wasteland
[2:53:03] <Inebriateddonut> RAGDOLL OFF A CLIFF
[2:53:04] <feralknights> @AngriestPat Roky's K-Drive is pretty amped up, the version you'll get for free is a little easier to control until you get your own custom board.
[2:53:04] <%BoarQueen> NICE
[2:53:04] <+Spenzor> LUL
[2:53:04] <+khalcipher> nice
[2:53:05] <+Pnutz_> I love how your frame just eats shit
[2:53:05] <BlackTribal> we got the Hall of Meat in this?
[2:53:06] <Ropcord> BIG WIPEOUTS
[2:53:08] <$Mornaka> he's so bad at stuff
[2:53:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat just don't K-drive in bounties or people get pissed
[2:53:13] <+Cybercobra2> ill be honest i love that the K-Drives arent like super easy
[2:53:14] <+Pnutz_> when you whipout
[2:53:16] <+dickbuttwoman> Drive into the coolant
[2:53:18] <$Niney_Who> That's a grab
[2:53:18] <+Grayhammatter> it's a grab you dumb
[2:53:21] <captainthunderwolf> I feel like the K-drives would be a lot less charming if they weren't as jank.
[2:53:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> more points
[2:53:22] <+Thorn14> Thy're called grabs pat
[2:53:22] <%skelet0njazzwizard> They are technically tricks fam
[2:53:22] <%flying_man_3> Pat doesnt know shit about skate tricks confirmed
[2:53:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> where's the button that makes you good
[2:53:26] <al0nem0nster> someone tell him the grabbing thing he's asking about changes what trick you do
[2:53:27] <$serpenttucker> Different grabs you dumb-dumb
[2:53:28] <Ludarac> Hey guys. What relics drop Elmo Prime parts?
[2:53:32] <+SuichiTanaka> Grabs used to get you trick score but they nerfed it immediately
[2:53:33] <+deanbees> it makes the trick fancier
[2:53:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat tricks have diminishing returns
[2:53:35] <+Thorn14> Gotta combine with spins or flips
[2:53:36] <al0nem0nster> allowing for higher combos
[2:53:37] <+st_judge> It does style silly
[2:53:37] <+dickbuttwoman> It adds more points for the trick
[2:53:38] <Djinnazz> STYLE
[2:53:38] <Mujihi> you can grab as you jump for sick tricks
[2:53:39] <CertainlySyrix> It gives you more points for your tricks.
[2:53:40] <@SSaryn> All I feel in my heart when I see that is, AIR TRICKS from Spiderman.
[2:53:40] <+SuichiTanaka> cause it was abused to cap out tricks easy
[2:53:40] <MC_GigglePants> The grabs lead to different tricks than normal flips
[2:53:44] <KangarooCyborg> Pat was never a teenage white kid apparently
[2:53:46] <+Jsaru> Pay digital extremes enough cash to program it in
[2:53:47] <%flying_man_3> look eveyone, its the Points Pipe
[2:53:53] <%skelet0njazzwizard> if you grind that big pipe you're near, you can farm the rep for the vent kids for fast k-drive
[2:53:54] <captainthunderwolf> @Ludarac Pat's continuous descent into geriatrics.
[2:53:57] <%knomad2b> pat never played a tony hawk
[2:54:02] <%flying_man_3> wrong
[2:54:04] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> yup just like tha t
[2:54:06] <NDHCemployee> @flying_man_3 Not anymore it ain't
[2:54:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat copykavat means you repeated too much
[2:54:08] <%BoarQueen> copykavat is when you do the trick twice
[2:54:10] <darthravel> Grinding a skateboard, ok. Grinding an expensive piece of anti-gravity tech, uhh
[2:54:12] <BlackTribal> so when the Tenno sponsored by Element, or Girl
[2:54:14] <%BoarQueen> it's bad for your score
[2:54:16] <+Thorn14> Copykavat is just reusing a move too much
[2:54:17] <+Solutha> copykavat = copycat
[2:54:17] <+dickbuttwoman> Copykavat means you did two tricks in a row
[2:54:19] <Zombrocom> copykavat is just you doing the same thing over and over
[2:54:26] <al0nem0nster> like a copy cat
[2:54:30] <al0nem0nster> except a space cat
[2:54:30] <+Jsaru> Its not that expensive a buncha kids own all of them
[2:54:31] <captainthunderwolf> Copykavat is the best move, always go for it.
[2:54:31] <%flying_man_3> @NDHCemployee its totes still is. Jsut did a bunch on it today
[2:54:36] <%Baesel20xx> @BoarQueen OH shit I didn't know that. Good. To. Know.

[2:56:26] <xoyv> parts are cosmetics
[2:56:27] <+bustawof> THATS THE SICKEST

[2:59:02] <+BaronEgo> THERES MORE THINGS
[2:59:04] <+Nephthyz> YOU GOTTA SEE THURSBY
[2:59:05] <al0nem0nster> anyone know a good way to grind that stuff that doesn't involve an infinite falling glitch?
[2:59:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> "I just assumed he died and gave up right away"
[2:59:06] <reonome> HERE I AM
[2:59:07] <+Jsaru> He doesn't even got the fishing and mining crap
[2:59:08] <+Cybercobra2> ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
[2:59:09] <Wonky_Chicken_Room> YEET
[2:59:11] <+binkarus> watashi ga kita
[2:59:13] <+khalcipher> go back
[2:59:14] <KangarooCyborg> The trick is to not suck
[2:59:15] <+WhyIDie> "oh, he's alive. that's fine... I guess. CHECK OUT MY SICK MOVES THO"
[2:59:17] <%flying_man_3> the trick is to do it well
[2:59:18] <Randomguyioi> THERE's TWO MORE PEOPLE TO TALK TO
[2:59:19] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> The trick is to be not bad
[2:59:20] <dekkitout> the trick is spinning
[2:59:23] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Weird trick
[2:59:25] <+TheEvaFreak> Try to only turn with camera as well
[2:59:25] <$floridianman> HEY thats pretty good
[2:59:25] <%BoarQueen> now get 3000
[2:59:28] <Ropcord> HE'S LEARNING
[2:59:29] <+deanbees> vertical sync apparently somehow fucks up grinds
[2:59:30] <+zork990> going faster makes it easier to stay grinding
[2:59:31] <Worldbrand> Yeah you basically just want to do as many flips and shit as possible while on a rail
[2:59:34] <$sassyquatch963> the trick is also looking at the rail
[2:59:34] <+willtheprofessional> They put Tony Hawk into Destiny, fuck yeah
[2:59:34] <+Solutha> grinding is just iffy
[2:59:34] <valdorick> Who would win in a style off: Pat or Woolie?
[2:59:35] <KangarooCyborg> Don't be shit! That's a neat trick!
[2:59:37] <%skelet0njazzwizard> Moving camera seems to fuck it up for me, not sure on controller tho
[2:59:38] <+dickbuttwoman> Gotta keep your camera aligned too
[2:59:38] <%flying_man_3> 3000 is cap
[2:59:43] <+Cybercobra2> hes beginning to believe
[2:59:46] <+CoffeeAndComputers> 3000 is the max for a single string
[2:59:49] <+Kqha4000> @AngriestPat Grinding is realtive to the camera so you gotta keep it on track too
[2:59:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat 3000 is max, rate is 1/4 score to standing
[2:59:51] <@SSaryn> Woah, person who said V-Sync fucks up grinding, that true?
[2:59:52] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> 3000 is the cap for a trick
[2:59:58] <al0nem0nster> There's a really long white pipe I know is good for it.
[2:59:58] <Laecerelius> It's not too hard to get 3k on the pipe near the entrance
[2:59:59] <$sassyquatch963> oh elmo he stuck
[3:00:00] <TropicalPsychosis> HE SHALL DISCOVER THE PEARL META
[3:00:05] <%Baesel20xx> Man the most ive ever gotten is 1000
[3:00:09] <+kuervojones> You only get 1/4 of the trick score for rep
[3:00:10] <%around_40_jobbers> PAT THERE IS A CHEESE PIPE FOR CONSTANTLY GETTING 3000 ON THE BACK OF FORTUNA
[3:00:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Laecerelius that got patched
[3:00:13] <+Cybercobra2> @AngriestPat also talk to buisness, euido, and go that door you trought was the elevator at first
[3:00:19] <$floridianman> legs lol
[3:00:19] <al0nem0nster> yeah...
[3:00:23] <Ropcord> he's fiiiiiiiiiine
[3:00:24] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> yup
[3:00:25] <%flying_man_3> its important to spin while you grind to build multipliers
[3:00:25] <+deanbees> @SSaryn ***
[3:00:27] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> it's fiiiine
[3:00:28] <+Khozza> ALL PRAISE THE PEARL

[3:00:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> he's living the dream. a human toilet selling junk to food himself with nothing
[3:00:45] <feralknights> His brain and his torso
[3:00:46] <+Thorn14> Uh...
[3:00:46] <cerberuscarmine> YOU DID THIS PAT

[3:00:52] <+Thorn14> LIVIN PAT'S DREAM
[3:00:53] <dekkitout> "He's more Bars than man, now"
[3:00:53] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> HIS HEART
[3:00:53] <+Grayhammatter> YOU DID THIS
[3:00:54] <+khalcipher> brain
[3:00:55] <Laecerelius> The braindead approach did but you can still jump, do a trick, go back to grinding, and repeat until you get a high multiplier to get 3k
[3:00:58] <%BoarQueen> "I DON'T HAVE ARMS ANYMORE!"
[3:00:59] <+Solutha> his cock, oh wait
[3:01:00] <+FloorBurger> KILL HIM
[3:01:01] <captainthunderwolf> What if that's not really Thursby?
[3:01:02] <OkamiDude15> LEGS PogChamp
[3:01:02] <BlackTribal> he is strangely optimistic for being an organ harvesting victim
[3:01:05] <+deanbees> @SSaryn well, it WAS a link to a de dev talking about how turning it off is a work around
[3:01:05] <thewhiterice92> "Top shelf parts!" YOU'VE GOT NO ARMS
[3:01:07] <%Baesel20xx> I like this kids attitude
[3:01:08] <$floridianman> HOW
[3:01:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I'LL BITE YA LEGS OFF!
[3:01:08] <captainthunderwolf> That could just be, like, a robot now.
[3:01:09] <Worldbrand> So someone mentioned that those plates on their torsos look like the window that Vox Solaris' head is in. We think their heads are in their chests.
[3:01:09] <ChineseNininga> Try to hit that large pipes next to the entrance, those are perfect for grinding practices
[3:01:11] <%nitronLVIII> I..
[3:01:12] <acridPaladin> Nothing. hes all robit
[3:01:13] <valdorick> Kinda sucks, they didn't give him arms, so he can't even work off the debt
[3:01:14] <Clinnamon> how does he build his moas with no arms
[3:01:15] <%AncelDeLambert> I'M INVINCIBLE!!!!!
[3:01:17] <%finaltrinity5> IS THIS ACTUALLY NIER WHAT
[3:01:18] <+Pnutz_> Now build a robo chicken
[3:01:18] <%flying_man_3> hes just a tub of person goo on a set of legs
[3:01:18] <RahuStalker> Look at the special
[3:01:19] <Wonky_Chicken_Room> well he's not named Arms
[3:01:19] <+Templar15> buy a robodoggo!
[3:01:20] <dekkitout> you may not like it but this is what the ideal male body looks like
[3:01:21] <MC_GigglePants> That's why his name is legs
[3:01:21] <%Baesel20xx> WHO NEEDS ARMS WHEN YOU GOT LEGS
[3:01:21] <xemeas> Hes a soda can now
[3:01:22] <+dickbuttwoman> The eternally upbeat brit is the best
[3:01:22] <+Thorn14> Pat's Jealous
[3:01:22] <Ropcord> DETERMINATION
[3:01:23] <%skelet0njazzwizard> HIS NAME AIN'T ARMS GODDAMN
[3:01:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> does he even have a dick anymore
[3:01:24] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> So if he got arms and not legs would he call himself Arms?
[3:01:25] <B1n0va> Probably like General Grevious
[3:01:26] <%Divryne> He's a MOA now Pat.
[3:01:26] <Ludarac> No arms, but he got LEGS
[3:01:26] <@SSaryn> @deanbees Ok cool, nice to know, haven't actually gotten into Fortuna yet so nice to know.
[3:01:26] <+SparkAfterDark> With his DICK
[3:01:27] <haisho> HE'S REAL GOOD WITH THOSE LEGS
[3:01:28] <%Wallabri> LEGS IS SO GREAT
[3:01:29] <$sassyquatch963> these moa's are good btw pat, pick one up
[3:01:30] <caja_de_ojos> HE CAN DO IT
[3:01:30] <+CoffeeAndComputers> Those legs are surprisingly articulate
[3:01:30] <sparrrow_> how does he wipe
[3:01:30] <%AncelDeLambert> It's only a flesh wound!
[3:01:33] <juxtest> ARMS ARE FOR CHUMPS
[3:01:36] <+ShogunNoonto> Will power
[3:01:36] <%texaporte> he kick the leggy
[3:01:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> WHY DO THEY EVEN BOTHER WITH THE SURGERY WHEN THEY CAN BEAM PEOPLES' BRAINS INTO ROBOTS
[3:01:37] <+Nephthyz> Isn't Krisys Core a Final Fantasy game?
[3:01:37] <viewtifulr> hands for feet?
[3:01:37] <NonAddictiveSlurm> he has those funky moa proboscus
[3:01:38] <al0nem0nster> I'm guessing he manipulates things with his feet, like a bird
[3:01:38] <captainthunderwolf> THOSE LEGS HAVE REAL GOOD TOES
[3:01:39] <Volkrotia> They dont say this, But its INPLIED that their brains are still inside the bodies.
[3:01:40] <%Divryne> PAT HE'S A MOA.
[3:01:42] <+dickbuttwoman> CRYSIS CORE
[3:01:45] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> HIS LEGS HAVE FINGERS

[3:01:46] <%finaltrinity5> WHAT ARE THOOOOOSE
[3:01:47] <shadespiral> >Named legs >Sells only one pair of Moa legs
[3:01:48] <+deanbees> WHO NEEDS ARMS WHEN YOU GOT LEGS FOR DAYS

[3:01:51] <42nfl19> TOP HAT
[3:01:52] <$Niney_Who> robot Ostrich
[3:01:52] <+cTAKU> I think pat broke
[3:01:54] <+FloorBurger> Pat barely has legs, lets face it.
[3:01:55] <+binkarus> maybe he has arms, but they're very very tiny
[3:01:57] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, you get MOA pets now? Sweet
[3:01:57] <OkamiDude15> HOW IS HE GONNA HAVE ANAME LIKE LEGS AND HAVE ARMS TOO PAT? THAT DONT MAKE SENSE
[3:01:57] <+Aleate> Pat doesn't like it LUL
[3:01:57] <@SSaryn> Nah don't worry about it.
[3:01:57] <%MrBorisMakarov> no it's fine tho
[3:01:59] <$rdark_ksu> arms are out OLD MAN. Its all about LEGS now

[3:03:35] <valdorick> @PlagueOfGripes I view it as rich people being assholes. Think about it - Give plebs coolshit, keep some organic parts on the ones you want working (debt is forever, but organic limbs tier), make full robots of people you hate (and don't give them some things, like arms), laugh as they can never pay down the debt of being a bitch'n robot.

[3:11:59] <valdorick> They're not
[3:11:59] <%BoarQueen> pats sure are
[3:12:00] <+CoffeeAndComputers> Yeah Pat, just like you
[3:12:02] <@SSaryn> Pretty sure thats dogs
[3:12:02] <Twoiis> dgos are but I don't know about cats
[3:12:03] <Graywolf_the_45th> I thought that was dogs
[3:12:04] <@PlagueOfGripes> next episode is Best of Both Worlds
[3:12:04] <captainthunderwolf> TNG is top-tier podcast material, do fight yeah
[3:12:04] <GingerDream89> Does he still shit in the tub?
[3:12:05] <+FloorBurger> Can Pats?
[3:12:08] <KangarooCyborg> Can Elmo see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch
[3:12:08] <OkamiDude15> elmo can see that your warframe is blue and not purple
[3:12:10] <+Dingalow> I don't know about cats...
[3:12:14] <Zombrocom> No
[3:12:15] <+SeanConnery94> i just watched the TNG ep with data and the masks holy shit
[3:12:16] <+Cybercobra2> dogs only have 2 tubes rather than 3. cats have 3 like humans
[3:12:18] <%Ferakin> Elmo can still see through your bullshit
[3:12:18] <bleugh> cowboy bebop - purple
[3:12:20] <+Jv9ufxcy> cats just see brighter
[3:12:21] <Endocrom> Cat's see some weird variation
[3:12:22] <Worldbrand> I dont think any mammals actually are, color seems like a really handy evolutionary advantage
[3:12:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat 3 is godlike
[3:12:35] <+Bupkis7> DOGS ARE NOT COLORBLIND
[3:12:36] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat Can you play the cup trick with Elmo or is he too special?
[3:12:37] <+Dingalow> Is the new Ratchet and Clank any good?
[3:12:39] <%texaporte> cats are color blind like hoomans
[3:12:41] <+ShinBojangles> have you named your stone wall bird???
[3:12:45] <+Cybercobra2> dogs are only half colourblind
[3:12:48] <Nordguy> Reboot is turds
[3:12:49] <captainthunderwolf> @Worldbrand Animals that are "color-blind" just see a smaller spectra. Dogs see in greens and yellows mostly.
[3:12:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Dingalow it's pretty good, but nothing like the old stuff
[3:13:04] <%SuperCasualBoom> What about Ratchet and Shank?
[3:13:08] <DracaenaLeaf> Ratchet and Clank is one of my favorite games and I've only played the first one.
[3:13:15] <Twoiis> They have to have phases of invincibility.
[3:13:25] <valdorick> Meanwhile, compared to the Mantis Shrimp, we're color blind like whoa
[3:13:26] <Neo_Kaiser> GamingBritshow did a great Ratchet and Clank video.
[3:13:31] <Worldbrand> Yeah they're really only bad when those invulnerability phases are out of the player's influence
[3:13:33] <%Baesel20xx> also theyre bad because some of them have been bugged for like 5 years
[3:13:33] <+Cybercobra2> basicly warframes are WAY TOO STRONG
[3:13:34] <%TaifuDragon> hm interesting
[3:13:38] <DracaenaLeaf> The reboot is good in gameplay but dumb in story
[3:13:38] <%Baesel20xx> looking at you lephantis
[3:13:40] <captainthunderwolf> Warframe needs spectacle bosses, there's no other option.
[3:13:41] <KangarooCyborg> dick damage is the strongest
[3:13:44] <flattopswag> @valdorick Those fuckers are mind-boggling
[3:13:51] <+Dingalow> @legendfather_of_giants Tar, man. I got it free with PS+ and have debated spending any time on it
[3:14:14] <Kaitepaints> I miss big dicks
[3:14:17] <valdorick> People want Catgirls with genetic engineering? Simpletons. I want that mantis shrimp eye shit in my genes.
[3:14:18] <+CoffeeAndComputers> They are bad because they are gimmicky
[3:14:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Dingalow I mean, the gameplay is still great, but weapon choice and story aren't as good as the first few.
[3:14:29] <%MrChap23> Was working on some school work. I've been branded as a lair?
[3:14:33] <%MrChap23> Lol
[3:14:35] <%TaifuDragon> Lockon would probably be cool tho
[3:14:37] <%MrChap23> Liar*
[3:14:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Dingalow I would, it's not too long
[3:14:56] <+Grayhammatter> aw yeah! SPACE hats
[3:14:57] <@SSaryn> Buy her a bunch of Platnium and hook her more.
[3:14:57] <Inebriateddonut> Good sister
[3:15:04] <+Dingalow> @legendfather_of_giants I never played the original games so I guess it won't bother me much
[3:15:07] <%texaporte> space ninja wizard show
[3:15:08] <+emperri> >pc lockon
[3:15:09] <wired_soul> space balls
[3:15:10] <+CoffeeAndComputers> They are space action figures. >:(
[3:15:12] <+emperri> oh my god bard
[3:15:15] <+emperri> barf even
[3:15:15] <%TaifuDragon> I mainly just mean as a mechanic in certain boss fights
[3:15:17] <captainthunderwolf> You shout, "WARFRAME, LOCK-ON" and the console hears you.
[3:15:19] <+omegasis> I'd feel like you'd get super motion sick with lockon with how fast you move
[3:15:23] <%TaifuDragon> Like "this is the only thing around, your camera sticks to it
[3:15:25] <Kaitepaints> @coffeeandcomputers respect
[3:15:30] <Worldbrand> That would be utterly pointless
[3:15:55] <%TaifuDragon> It lets you do a lot more complex stuff in a boss fight because you don't need to worry about your players getting disoriented
[3:15:58] <captainthunderwolf> Woolie finds himself spontaneously erect, and does not know why.
[3:15:59] <bunbundabuni> wai, pat is sick? get well soon
[3:16:04] <%TaifuDragon> From a development perspective
[3:16:11] <+emperri> oh no, pat cursed HIMSELF
[3:16:22] <%SuperCasualBoom> You wouldn’t want a Patfectris?
[3:16:24] <$Falilth> coxFeedMe
[3:16:29] <captainthunderwolf> Disappointed with the cooking of the duck meat.

[3:17:04] <+ShinBojangles> Am I the only one that cares about creating lore around the bird on the wall behind Pat?
[3:17:22] <Kaitepaints> @shinbojangles probs
[3:17:24] <+emperri> taped duck
[3:17:25] <Graywolf_the_45th> Ducked tape
[3:17:29] <+CoffeeAndComputers> That's called being cruel
[3:17:31] <@SSaryn> Duck't'd ducked tape?
[3:17:34] <Inebriateddonut> Tucked Dape?
[3:17:35] <+Grayhammatter> shinning?
[3:17:35] <valdorick> What if those ducks are in a duct?
[3:17:36] <bunbundabuni> goose tape
[3:17:40] <+SuichiTanaka> It's Duck Tape. That was first. Duct was later.
[3:17:46] <+emperri> he's got the shinnin
[3:17:55] <@SSaryn> To be fair, those colors are not that expensive.
[3:17:56] <captainthunderwolf> Paige is gonna watch the VOD and stab you while you're sleeping.
[3:18:17] <%Ferakin> Thats for sure happened at least twice
[3:18:18] <+emperri> no it's a prophecy
[3:18:19] <Kaitepaints> It’s not for ducts.
[3:18:23] <+Dingalow> fuck you
[3:18:27] <FirewallStorm> lies
[3:18:27] <captainthunderwolf> INDIGO IS THERE TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO
[3:18:31] <Them00n> indigo is a blue
[3:18:32] <KangarooCyborg> Indigo isn't real. You fight the elite 4 there
[3:18:34] <+CoffeeAndComputers> There is no such thing as purple. pat.
[3:18:34] <+imporia_> I say green is a just a really yellowish shade of blue
[3:18:36] <%BoarQueen> blurple
[3:18:37] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[3:18:37] <ape_hawk> is pat leaving?
[3:18:38] <grayjammer> Indigo is a purple and your warframe's colour was STILL blue
[3:18:38] <%spacekataz18> Indigo is a hair salon
[3:18:39] <benswanny> Just tuned in. another "VIDEYA GAME" stream of 10000000% talking
[3:18:40] <@SSaryn> HAH
[3:18:41] <+FloorBurger> is bloo
[3:18:41] <Inebriateddonut> Pat's hill has become a hole that he's dying in
[3:18:43] <ape_hawk> did he beat the warframes?
[3:18:46] <Kaitepaints> It’s blue
[3:18:48] <%SuperCasualBoom> Indigo prophecy
[3:18:49] <%SweetCheeksTrap> ahahaha
[3:18:51] <+emperri> adaman hauberk is purple btw
[3:18:53] <Worldbrand> Maybe we can crowdfund to get indigo recognition as its own color. start an indigo indiegogo
[3:18:55] <%SweetCheeksTrap> blue + purple
[3:18:56] <+Bupkis7> INDEGO IS PURPLE
[3:19:01] <Kaitepaints> Nice!
[3:19:13] <enoughmold> Purple prophesy
[3:19:13] <+NWR_James> BIG wrong
[3:19:14] <%texaporte> purplue?
[3:19:23] <Randomguyioi> Crazy Talk Prime
[3:19:26] <valdorick> Indigo is a red Kappa
[3:19:29] <%BoarQueen> i guess it WAS the internet's fault
[3:19:30] <Worldbrand> Well are either of you using flux?
[3:19:31] <+NWR_James> color is just chemicals
[3:19:32] <+Grayhammatter> jesus christ
[3:19:33] <captainthunderwolf> But for the actual discussion, people perceive colors differently, and the reason that Indigo is fought over so often is because those colors occupy an area of the spectrum your brain can read either way.
