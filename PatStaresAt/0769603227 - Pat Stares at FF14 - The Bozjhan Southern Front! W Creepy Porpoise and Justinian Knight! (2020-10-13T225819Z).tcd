[0:01:11] <dynastesx> bozjer
[0:01:20] <%YakumoYomi> I don't know why, but "Prime Gaming" sounds somewhat nefarious
[0:01:21] <yoru899> FF14
[0:01:28] <causewaybob> @arisato_ii yussss
[0:01:31] <%jackythefrost> jackythefrost subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 8 month streak! YO PAT. Been playing Bozja myself and you'll be happy to know its WAY better than Eureka was. My only word of advice, fear the big red chicken.
[0:01:34] <%RyanGelatin> woooooo more muhmorpuhguh
[0:01:36] <@mothmandraws> man this relic is nuts for fate grinding, already 90% done, you can finish relic in hour and a half lol

[0:02:01] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to dynastesx! They have given 363 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:02:08] <%ashenfrenzy> bozja has been great for leveling so far imo
[0:02:10] <+campasino> poopoo peepee
[0:02:13] <+echobee_tv> Howdy y'all!
[0:02:14] <Nordguy> jesus 363
[0:02:26] <%ajvstheworld> Prime Gaming just means I get 5 free PC games a month.
[0:02:27] <@mothmandraws> heavensward fates have 100% drop, 60 fates=relic lol
[0:02:28] <%AncelDeLambert> hey folks who's ready to be mega confused?
[0:02:32] <%AncelDeLambert> I sure am
[0:02:42] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> chat whát's the monthly subscription fee for ff14?
[0:02:45] <%Kiiper> What the fuck Moth
[0:02:50] <%Kiiper> for real?
[0:02:53] <%JeanGardner99> JeanGardner99 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! hey 19 montheronnis, I was just about to start up a YouTube vod to listen to as I work, this works even better
[0:02:58] <%chaosform23> hi everyone
[0:03:04] <%AncelDeLambert> @SaltkeyAndAckfish too much considering you also PAY full price for the game to start
[0:03:15] <%afronooch> yo yo
[0:03:17] <~PatStaresAt> you don't pay full price though
[0:03:19] <SPidERMan8576> The monthly fee for ff14 is a life
[0:03:21] <%ajvstheworld> I haven’t even completed a Realm Reborn so I’m gonna be SO CONFUSED.
[0:03:26] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @AncelDeLambert that's kinda what I'm suspecting
[0:03:26] <+vdalson> @saltkeyandackfish $12/mo for one char per server, $15 for more
[0:03:29] <@mothmandraws> ye kip im nearly done relic
[0:03:29] <~PatStaresAt> You pay for the base games + 1 expansion, instead of base game + all expansions
[0:03:32] <%YakumoYomi> I don't play FF14 (or MMOs in general), so anything outside of the general terms is gibberish to me
[0:03:33] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt ok but i just want a number
[0:03:38] <%Garthunox> Bozja is so good, and also, i got a house in FF14!
[0:03:39] <%RyanGelatin> damn ive gotta get back to 14
[0:03:41] <~PatStaresAt> It's like 12 USD
[0:03:49] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @vdalson thanks!
[0:03:53] <+blastazoid26> @SaltkeyAndAckfish about $13 for a one character per server or $15 for unlimited characters
[0:03:54] <%RyanGelatin> wasted my subscription cos i got busy/bored like a week after i bought it
[0:03:56] <+BallerSwagBro9k> TIME FOR STREM
[0:04:01] <Nordguy> more like 14
[0:04:02] <%RyanGelatin> now im unemployed and wanna play again lol
[0:04:04] <%BruceBogtrotter123> wud is upppppp
[0:04:07] <%ajvstheworld> Last time I played a monk then switched to Samurai.
[0:04:16] <FallenVerto81> psaGoblin_TK Grinding stream?
[0:04:19] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> yeah that doesn't seem worth to me
[0:04:20] <%ajvstheworld> My poor Samurai is only level 60.
[0:04:29] <%Eldalu> Eldalu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I got 13 Sent after your intro stream, and loved it. Sadly my PS4 died when I was at the last 10% of the story, and I had to watch it online. Still amazing though
[0:04:34] <+blastazoid26> @PatStaresAt When's the Blue mage stream???
[0:04:34] <%RyanGelatin> Wait i think ill get another paycheck
[0:04:48] <%RyanGelatin> thank fuck ill have something to do
[0:04:49] <Arisato_II> i miss my dragoon and my chocobo
[0:04:55] <+vdalson> it's also free trial to like level 60, plenty of time to get a sense of its worth it
[0:04:58] <%AncelDeLambert> the big problem I have is I don't see the point of paying $30 for two retainers for a month, and still having to pay another 30 for the expansions which then goes into a monthly subscription
[0:05:04] <%JaydenSai> JaydenSai subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 39 months, that's one helluva commitment! Good thing its too two of my favorite canadians! And the pig baby and baby grandpa, of course

[0:05:28] <causewaybob> Ah it’s fun
[0:05:37] <%RyanGelatin> can i go back to a free trial version after i already started paying a sub?
[0:05:41] <%BruceBogtrotter123> where's the flappy heed

[0:06:39] <%AncelDeLambert> the main issue is that I actually liked the crafting, so I focused the crafting. And ran out of inventory. Then I hit gil cap. Now any main story quest progress I make will come with me gaining very little as a result

[0:43:51] <Aydarkzero> monkaS

[0:44:19] <+JamminMage> I made that mistake
[0:44:38] <Kivros> dwarves are the best smiths and they are always drunk
[0:44:55] <tartissimus> engravings give you no tactical advantage whatsoever
[0:45:05] <watts121> who knows, they all got wiped out by the Imperials
[0:45:09] <AzureGale> Back to the past
[0:45:26] <Dwarven_Gaming> so...job crystals?
[0:45:43] <%maskofmichael> Casual time travel is the worst
[0:45:44] <Azathotic> So the Bozjan's invented Job Stones, right? Cause thats literally just Job Stones
[0:45:46] <%realm_forge> Go back. Back to the past. Samurai Pat.

[0:47:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> in want of a nail the horse was lost
[0:47:12] <suikudo> DAMNIT
[0:47:15] <%Giggalith> monk is 5.4 I think
[0:47:17] <cizal11> @suikudo that's in 5.4. don't expect much from it though.
[0:47:17] <+mMayrro> crystal methe?
[0:47:18] <watts121> 5.4 hopefully
[0:47:23] <DianaTheAscian> 60 total per weapon

[0:47:39] <BluBox> It's a guaranteed drop on every fate
[0:47:42] <+zedreamcast> @suikudo they told us a bit and grease lightning is a permanent buff rather than something you build up
[0:47:44] <cizal11> wait it drops guaranteed? that seems busted

[1:05:56] <%heartlesshealer> as a group play gunbreaker?
[1:06:06] <+NeonLight> GNB plays so much like a dps
[1:06:07] <@SpaceCapnCrone> It's blue dps
[1:06:08] <Kain5707> its a blue dps
[1:06:09] <$Afterman_> it's the best tank class in any mmo
[1:06:09] <maebold> GNB seems cool but man I wish the weapons were bigger? They seem so small to me
[1:06:10] <+skyheys> Is it?
[1:06:11] <Dwarven_Gaming> its a blue dps
[1:06:13] <watts121> It's a tank that plays like a dps
[1:06:13] <%Valdorick> Its a DPS tank

[1:06:20] <%heartlesshealer> holiday bear
[1:06:21] <+astralelephant> GNB is a DPS with an identity crisis
[1:06:22] <+sapientius_the_great> sapientius_the_great subscribed with Prime. 
[1:06:26] <Top_Lane_Duelist> nothing protects more than a gun
[1:06:27] <Surprise_Anole> it's like a DPS but you can afford to get hit more often
[1:06:27] <StarlingSilence> a burr
[1:06:35] <Cerabret100> @PeachSaliva peach if you're here, whats the consistancy of finished clafoutis, should it be custardy or solid?
[1:06:37] <watts121> GNB is probably the 2nd best tank in the game honestly.
[1:06:42] <+luftraumm1> why u. playing gnb
[1:06:42] <+NeonLight> I just started trying GNB out and I already miss the old sword sounds
[1:06:44] <%AquilaHarukaze> GNB is a DPS main who wants faster queues.
[1:06:52] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I want samurai as a fucking* tank
[1:06:53] <%Grustamar> Grustamar subscribed at Tier 1.

[1:07:20] <%AquilaHarukaze> He's playing the better tank job.
[1:07:27] <Tennochief> Today is the day he lives
[1:07:32] <+HeyBoston> lmao
[1:07:32] <@SSaryn> He's probably Resistance rank 4 or 5 already.
[1:07:34] <%Mendin> 1/2 are soloable, 3 is tricky but doable, 4 you want help, 5 you probably want a tank, * you want a party
[1:07:36] <maebold> nice going nimrod ahaha
[1:07:47] <VioletRosefall> wait whats that barding?
[1:07:47] <+skyheys> @aquilaharukaze Paladin has such a massive advantage here

[2:13:03] <Dwarven_Gaming> SSR SLOPPEH
[2:13:39] <+LittleBigQuebec> also after rank 5 you lose some mettle if you die so care
[2:13:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> one of the things about this type of game that intimidates me is all the little actions and buttons. Seems easier w/ a controller, tho
[2:13:53] <Ciglossonjr> The zombified corpse of cross-class skills live on
[2:14:00] <+LittleBigQuebec> i don't know if you rank down tho
[2:14:13] <+MayorRev> STEVE'S OUT
[2:14:29] <TheFilth> good thing the Bozjan theme is a banger
[2:14:30] <+garekerag> @GarbageQueenEllie controller is a bit of a hassle to configure but after that it's all good
