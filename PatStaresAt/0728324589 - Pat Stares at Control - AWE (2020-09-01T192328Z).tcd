[0:52:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> ALAN IS HOLDING BACK THE DARKNESS
[0:52:45] <dukenux> So per Control, Alan is still stuck in the dark place?
[0:52:45] <Cherokia666> rekt
[0:52:45] <heartlesshealer> oh god this autopsy
[0:52:46] <%Niney_Who> Bear Tractor
[0:52:47] <BoneofMalkav> In before Alan Wake wrote a character that is essentially Sam Lake.
[0:53:02] <artoflec> what does avulsion mean artofl1St
[0:53:09] <$Dakuu75> It was the slender man
[0:53:17] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[0:53:20] <transporterthesequel> BEAR TRACTOR
[0:53:23] <$Dakuu75> -or a wendigo
[0:53:29] <heartlesshealer> @artoflec pulling/tearing
[0:53:30] <$RealThiele> In medicine, an avulsion is an injury in which a body structure is torn off by either trauma or surgery. The term most commonly refers to a surface trauma where all layers of the skin have been torn away, exposing the underlying structures. This is similar to an abrasion but more severe, as body parts such as an eyelid or an ear can be partially or fully detached from the body.
[0:53:33] <%cowardman93> Pat require CUBE
[0:53:34] <ape_hawk> my dick
[0:53:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> @artoflec avulsion [ah-vul´shun] the tearing away of a structure or part either accidentally or surgically.
[0:53:41] <%BinaryFireball> one hell of a light
[0:53:49] <artoflec> 😱
[0:53:52] <%phantomsleeves> just got here, why no camera?
[0:54:03] <artoflec> pat peed his pants
[0:54:04] <BallerSwagBro9k> @phantomsleeves No pants
[0:54:07] <$RealThiele> no pants, baybe pee
[0:54:08] <heartlesshealer> pee pants
[0:54:11] <%Radski5> TL;DR Avulsion is removed, I.E skin or eyelids, but can mean anything really.
[0:54:15] <transporterthesequel> Gief has destroyed all pants
[0:54:24] <%cowardman93> Pat you're dealing with Alan Wake stuff. You may want light
[0:54:27] <KnightAsteran> FUCK WHAT HAVE I MISSED
[0:54:35] <ape_hawk> OOOPS
[0:54:35] <SleepySamsquanch> He peed himself at the NVIDIA conference announcements. Too excited.
[0:54:40] <heartlesshealer> avulsion is removal through pulling or tearing specifically
[0:54:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[0:54:45] <$RealThiele> no pants, alan wake is warrior of light
[0:54:46] <artoflec> woooaahh

[0:55:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yup
[0:55:12] <%za7az> Ah okay, thanks
[0:55:21] <%Dwarven_Gaming> god i LOVE this dlc
[0:55:22] <MrPedrovsky> @knightasteran Bright falls constantly happening and Alan is holding it down by infinity writing in the shadow realm and he is trapped there
[0:55:25] <$Dakuu75> Cool
[0:55:26] <%Radski5> @knightasteran A bit of worldbuilding and the reveal that Alan Wake is an AWE creator or something.
[0:55:53] <$RealThiele> Alan Wake sent to the Shadow Realm after his Duel with Yugi
[0:56:03] <penitentpentwitch> Category: Mega AWE
[0:56:05] <%Deekman> oh man this has the best ending
[0:56:05] <%Dwarven_Gaming> this is like CHUTHULU level shit
[0:56:10] <%Niney_Who> Alan basically dealt with a Keter-class problem compared to a lot of the Euclid types in the facility
[0:56:14] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Eh more like its amazing that a semi normal man could deal with a huge threat
[0:56:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> The FBC regularly deals with bullshit like the darkness pat...
[0:56:44] <+Delenay> the camera from the last dlc
[0:56:44] <KnightAsteran> hope this isn't the 50 Blessings group
[0:56:48] <MrPedrovsky> So can we all agree that Alan Wake 2 is basically confirmed?
[0:56:55] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Hinting at a FUTURE GAME?!
[0:57:04] <$RealThiele> Alan Wake x Jackie Esticado?
[0:57:08] <%Radski5> Alan Wake essentially became an Apollyon level SCP to deal with a Keter level SCP.

[1:23:51] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> i love how paracriminal is a term in this universe

[1:27:25] <+SlashHabit> does the alan wake reality have the second pyramid?
[1:27:27] <%RyTYoung> I love this DLC so much
[1:27:28] <%juxtest> Uh oh
[1:27:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> Floaty Boi
[1:27:29] <madskull456> i guess that means no one understands art, so art can alter darkness
[1:27:31] <clockworknait1> I felt kinda lost in this because I didn't play the Alan wake dlc
[1:27:31] <$lotharrio> You woke them up. They were napping, Pat.
[1:27:46] <%juxtest> Hiss with Jetpacks!
[1:27:56] <avidneptune> They fly now?!
[1:27:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> @clockworknait1 Bruh u missed the best and most important part LUL
[1:28:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> THEY FLY NOE
[1:28:10] <LorcaNomad> has pat gotten any better mods since finishing the base game?
[1:28:19] <+janus_the_captive> they fly now...
[1:28:31] <%RyTYoung> @clockworknait1 Actually the American Nightmare stuff isnt too prevalent, it's got more connections to the main game
[1:28:39] <heartlesshealer> got a motive, I think you can craft something now
[1:28:40] <$KnivesEve> pee? eww
[1:28:42] <Djinnazz> no
[1:28:53] <ivanmistwalker> yes
[1:29:00] <%weissguard> psaBig psaHoldon psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaDogchamp
[1:29:18] <clockworknait1> @ballerswagbro9k That's what I figured, I played a.w all the way through, lost my save , then did it again and missed the dlc. Then played control
[1:29:29] <%Beough> i've been gone for a hot second to grab dinner and talk to my folks, and i missed a bit of this room, did he grab the audio log under the desk in this room he's in?
[1:29:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> oh shit, just saw the new zangief bit in the brb screen
[1:29:51] <%Beough> that's like one of my favorite audio logs
[1:30:32] <%RyTYoung> Yeah that audio log was strong
[1:30:58] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> did pat ever fid the american overnight ep where blessed is mentioned?
[1:31:25] <upsidedown01> Zangief is in the BRB loop! :D cute
[1:32:04] <%Beough> @RyTYoung when i first played through the dlc, that log scared the shit out of me, just thinking about some like unknown figure finding this dude observing the motel and doing god knows what, creeped me the fuck out
[1:32:06] <%RyTYoung> @prettythickandstrongdyck in Control?
[1:32:29] <%Beough> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck yeah but he was dealing with zangief at the time i think
[1:32:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @RyTYoung yea
[1:32:43] <%Beough> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck if you mean the one in the foundation dlc
[1:33:13] <%Deekman> this is the longest piss ever
[1:33:16] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck yeah that one where it kills the producer
[1:33:25] <%juxtest> Pat has been taken over by the Piss
[1:33:46] <%RyTYoung> @beough yeah it was pretty strange, especially since the Motel doesn't have much going on when you're there in the game, the audio logs in this dlc are great as a whole
[1:34:07] <doctor_deadbeat> pat got hiss from his piss?
[1:34:18] <clempstwitch> 154 raiders from clempstwitch have joined!

[1:53:58] <%tattleworm> at least he hasn't been huffing mold
[1:54:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> Who let that monster compete? He's way too strong! What's up with that!
[1:54:01] <penitentpentwitch> Look at you being a gimmick and a half boss!

[1:56:11] <%Totally_Not_Toby> it should've kept that filter
[1:56:13] <%RyTYoung> Yeah I want more retro music
[1:56:14] <Daxalog> You thought
[1:56:16] <MrPedrovsky> SHUM IS THE WAY YOU SAY NOISE IN RUSSIAN,!!!!
[1:56:17] <%OperatorJo_> oh booo a horde mode
[1:56:20] <%BinaryFireball> that's dumb
[1:56:20] <MasterTonberry23> horde mode, laaaaame
[1:56:20] <+Capn_Trips> Not arcade game, immediately wack
[1:56:25] <%narusao> you got shumed
[1:56:26] <%CorpulentToad> Hey Pat
[1:56:28] <raikagelord1> Awww man

[1:56:37] <%RyTYoung> @mrpedrovsky cool!
[1:56:37] <Daxalog> Get Shum bugged
[1:56:38] <WiredAbyss> This is really long
[1:56:39] <SaltyAzteca> dayum
[1:56:43] <Rei_Dsoto> No, it's a minigame
[1:56:45] <%BinaryFireball> we were set up
[1:57:17] <MrPedrovsky> SHUM=NOISE=HISS. DONT YA GET IT?!?!?!?!?
[1:57:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's like poetry.
[1:57:34] <$ItsRatman> I just remembered this thing takes FOREVER
[1:57:34] <Rei_Dsoto> Everything's a JOJO REFERENCE! DX
[1:57:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> Shumthing wrong Pat?
[1:58:02] <+Javaa01> Yeah, it's a proper horde mode
[1:58:10] <Rei_Dsoto> @Reizie_Etherealm He just realized he's in for a LONG minigame
[1:58:14] <%RyTYoung> @mrpedrovsky *mind blown*
[1:58:17] <Rei_Dsoto> also, good pun
[1:58:26] <penitentpentwitch> It seems less 'Horde' and more 'Endure'
[1:58:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I am getting huge Warframe-but-slower vibes from this
[1:58:51] <clockworknait1> I just loaded back up to the end and got soft locked
[1:58:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god I just saw the progress bar
[1:58:57] <penitentpentwitch> At least no air totems to worry about
[1:59:44] <SaltyAzteca> 3rd wave
[1:59:49] <Rei_Dsoto> Eeeyup
[1:59:58] <penitentpentwitch> 3/10 by the look of it
[1:59:59] <+LordSDB> I'm surprised you didn't notice you got shot from behind
[2:00:02] <Reizie_Etherealm> We might be here for a while
[2:00:15] <%Deekman> is it worth beating?
[2:00:17] <Daxalog> Are you killing them fast enough?
[2:00:18] <MasterTonberry23> Tenno, hold on for a while longer
[2:00:32] <penitentpentwitch> "Enough is enough, Simaris!"
[2:00:36] <%Typhaeon> Rock vs rock
[2:00:39] <%Typhaeon> rock wins
[2:00:45] <Rei_Dsoto> The horde mode? Probably. Control in general? It's pretty good in my opinion
[2:00:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> I know that if you complete both shum and shum 2 you get an outfit
[2:00:51] <%chiluzza> chiluzza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 7 month streak! never trust dogs around veggies, i was growing cucumber and tomatoes this year only for my cucumber harvest to be less then i expected only to turn around look outside and see my corgi CONSUMING a cucumber off the vine.
[2:00:52] <+terra_fy> You should play Saints Row 4 instead. It seems way more fun than this with similar power mechanics and such!
[2:01:20] <MasterTonberry23> Saints Row 4 is an amazing game, though 2 is still the best
[2:01:21] <%Razputin217> “Can I interest you in some half priced life support?”
[2:01:23] <%Shockrates20XX> I never tried this game. Does it feel as much like Mass Effect as it looks, gameplay wise?
[2:01:38] <Djinnazz> no
[2:01:43] <+terra_fy> @MasterTonberry23 For sure!
[2:01:45] <Rei_Dsoto> no
[2:01:52] <doctor_deadbeat> there ya go
[2:01:55] <%Dr_DangerPhD> no
[2:02:01] <penitentpentwitch> Good use of shield there
[2:02:11] <%Deekman> holy shit there's so many waves left
[2:02:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> The best defense/survival game mode would be gears of wars horde mode I think, it has tower defense mechanics where you can enable traps and such to help defend
[2:02:18] <Djinnazz> mind take that thing, that laser does dmg.
[2:02:21] <chambatron> I miss you so
[2:02:31] <+SH1NK1R0> This game looks nothing like ME what?
[2:02:33] <Reizie_Etherealm> Did she just praise the sun?
[2:02:44] <Rei_Dsoto> no
[2:02:46] <doctor_deadbeat> praise the sun
[2:02:48] <$ItsRatman> oh interesting i did AWE before Foundation, so I never saw the pickaxe enemies in SHUM
[2:02:52] <SaltyAzteca> 4th wave!
[2:02:52] <ape_hawk> ORB
[2:02:58] <Djinnazz> OORRB
[2:02:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get ORB'd
[2:02:58] <doctor_deadbeat> get ball
[2:03:00] <penitentpentwitch> I assume they're making parallels to playing as a Biotic?
[2:03:01] <%RyTYoung> The ball has been such a dick to me recently
[2:03:02] <MasterTonberry23> DEAD
[2:03:02] <Reizie_Etherealm> Which one even? Andromeda?
[2:03:03] <Djinnazz> awwww
[2:03:05] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[2:03:05] <heartlesshealer> huh
[2:03:06] <SaltyAzteca> GAME OVER BibleThump
[2:03:08] <a_mad_dragon> wtf was that LUL
[2:03:09] <gluttonousmimic> Big Dead.
[2:03:12] <%barrakuta371> Get SHUM'd
[2:03:12] <doctor_deadbeat> aaaaaand that's a shum
[2:03:13] <Rei_Dsoto> You tried.
[2:03:13] <$lotharrio> Well there goes your quarter.
[2:03:14] <ape_hawk> pat sucks at arcade games
[2:03:14] <%afronooch> it do look a bit like Mass Effect. Minus the blue space magic
[2:03:14] <Daxalog> SHUMED
[2:03:16] <%narusao> get shummed
[2:03:17] <penitentpentwitch> Big Tough
[2:03:17] <Mr_Strut> did you?
[2:03:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> Foolishness Pat, foolishness
[2:03:26] <%코코꾸라> SHUMMED
[2:03:27] <%tattleworm> beating these unlocks mods and a neat outfit but yeah, it takes awhile
[2:03:29] <Storm_Samurai> BIG SHUM
[2:03:32] <ape_hawk> pat, the second machine is a boss select
[2:03:40] <%Basilias_Maximus> There's a vending machine behind you.
[2:03:42] <shruke> the hiss particle efffect works so well for invisibility
[2:03:44] <penitentpentwitch> The drops aren't great
[2:03:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> Not even a 1
[2:03:47] <%RyTYoung> have you got any number VI mods @patstaresat ?
[2:03:54] <42nfl19> I think there was a second game?
[2:04:00] <+Delenay> can these be done before you finish the game?
[2:04:04] <clockworknait1> same here , even in secret areas I'm finding crap level 3
[2:04:10] <doctor_deadbeat> you have to beat first game to get second
[2:04:14] <raikagelord1> Their was a second game.
[2:04:15] <%RyTYoung> likewise
[2:04:21] <gluttonousmimic> Shumed, Shummed? ... Shum'd?
[2:04:23] <%OperatorJo_> it makes sense if this isn't post-game accessible only
[2:04:23] <%RyTYoung> I've not had many VI mods
[2:04:32] <doctor_deadbeat> second shum only unlocks after you beat the first
[2:04:34] <$hypermegashun> good timing woolies stream just ended
[2:04:34] <+JustToWatch> the other shum game is much quicker
[2:04:36] <%RyTYoung> @operatorjo_ true
[2:04:43] <%Deekman> @PatStaresAt ok beating Shum unlocks Shum 2 which allows you to refight bosses. That's it
[2:04:45] <%tattleworm> there are some unique mods in this dlc that i'm pretty sure you'll like, shatter in particular is incredible
[2:04:48] <penitentpentwitch> Definetly something that annoyed me overall in this game, the "Random Drop" upgrade path
[2:04:51] <%Basilias_Maximus> What was that thing inside the vending machine before you threw it?
[2:05:12] <iamnotaparrot> this DLC has a super secret mod that heals you every time you dodge. you have to decipher codes from the song that plays during the ashtray maze to learn it
[2:05:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> CONTROL
[2:05:12] <Djinnazz> This they're version of 'The Twilight Zone"?
[2:05:17] <+Delenay> did he actually write control
[2:05:18] <ape_hawk> YUP
[2:05:18] <SaltyAzteca> Ba dum tsh?
[2:05:19] <ToneBacas> mother fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[2:05:22] <+Delenay> just to get him out
[2:05:23] <$KnivesEve> HMM
[2:05:24] <%RyTYoung> No way
[2:05:24] <%OperatorJo_> oh no
[2:05:25] <+ianabstract> TAKE CONTROL
[2:05:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> At this point what DIDN'T he write?
[2:05:27] <Mr_Strut> Maybe
[2:05:27] <heartlesshealer> :0
[2:05:29] <clockworknait1> thats what I'm thinking
[2:05:30] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> noi
[2:05:30] <%Deekman> HMMMMMMMMMMMM
[2:05:33] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> No pat

[2:05:38] <%Deekman> kylebo1MyPlan
[2:05:40] <transporterthesequel> MAYBE
[2:05:40] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Im thinking thats bullshit
[2:05:40] <$Zalthia> Alaaaaaaaan
[2:05:41] <+Delenay> zoom out but is it really?
[2:05:41] <LordOfThePoultry> HMMMM
[2:05:41] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt did you not want to check out the second game?
[2:05:42] <ToneBacas> we are all Alan Wake
[2:05:42] <$lotharrio> Questionable, but he's probably been influencing it.
[2:05:47] <MasterTonberry23> impossible, the FBC dates back decades! ...unless...
[2:05:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> My brain trembles
[2:05:51] <+ianabstract> wibbly wobbly timey wimey
[2:05:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> He's responsible for the creation of all supernatural shit in the world confirmed
[2:05:53] <penitentpentwitch> I await him putting off a meeting with "Director Faden" in Alan Wake 2
[2:05:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT IF HE CREATED THE BOARD?
[2:05:57] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Im calling bullshit
[2:05:58] <+BigCoffee> the FBC?
[2:06:01] <transporterthesequel> I mean he’s writing Jesse RIGHT NOW
[2:06:08] <ape_hawk> So, Pat, think of this: The Typewriter is basically the Loom of Fate
[2:06:09] <%bhp_99> The real journey was all the Alan Wakes we made along the way
[2:06:15] <SaltyAzteca> Alan Wake 1.8
[2:06:16] <%tattleworm> alan wake gaiden
[2:06:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> @BigCoffee Federal Bureau of Control
[2:06:25] <a_mad_dragon> oops i accidentally a secret government agency
[2:06:27] <+TheBigO75> It seemed like a spiritual successor if anything.
[2:06:30] <%RyTYoung> I would like a re-release of Alan Wake with the DLC's
[2:06:33] <MasterTonberry23> Oh my God Alan created Jesse and the FBC to save himself from the Dark Place
[2:06:35] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> My bet is hers influencing Jesses actions rn
[2:06:39] <%Deekman> i think Alan Wake 2 would have an issue since you won't have all the amazing powers Jesse does
[2:06:39] <ToneBacas> so Alan Wake can just write stuff into existence
[2:06:44] <+SH1NK1R0> Or is allen wake just control 1? Hhhhhmmmmm?
[2:06:44] <Reizie_Etherealm> He wrote the bureau, he wrote all the entities within it, he wrote the all AWEs, he's basically god

[2:08:16] <clockworknait1> Was Alan wake ...writing the story in the beginning..but created the town and people or just making them do what he wrote?
[2:08:18] <heartlesshealer> oh no he's abusing the PA system
[2:08:23] <ToneBacas> this is important
[2:08:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> I love Langston LUL

[2:20:16] <%Deekman> @PatStaresAt GO DOWN LEFT SHAFT!
[2:20:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> So the FBC has black evil tar and just literally tar?

[2:21:04] <MasterTonberry23> game says no sequence breaking
[2:21:05] <+Javaa01> Gotta do the puzzle legit
[2:21:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:21:06] <penitentpentwitch> The developers were ready
[2:21:08] <%Deekman> lol
[2:21:22] <%Deekman> yeah i liked this puzzle
[2:21:32] <%Deekman> time for shadow puzzle
[2:21:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, what's actually worse, The Hiss or the Black Evil (I legitimately forgot its actual name)?
[2:21:53] <%RyTYoung> I like trains
[2:22:10] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> pat has boomer brain
[2:22:15] <%RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks you mean the Shadow?
[2:22:16] <MasterTonberry23> @CommanderSqueaks the dark prescence
[2:22:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dark Presence, yes.
[2:22:30] <%RyTYoung> or shadow's
[2:22:39] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Id say the hiss are worse
[2:22:50] <MasterTonberry23> tbh the hiss and dark prescence are practically the same thing, they possess people and...yeah
[2:23:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> They both spread their corruption so yeah, equally bad
[2:23:09] <%RyTYoung> yeah hiss are not cool, I'd be cool with getting some dark presence in me
[2:23:12] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> The hiss are unpredictable while the shadow is intelligent but can be fought off with a flashlight
[2:23:14] <Djinnazz> If the suns out the Darkness can't do anything. The Hiss would spread wolrd wide in hours.
[2:23:14] <penitentpentwitch> Puzzle defeated
[2:23:18] <ape_hawk> now THESE are shadow puzzles!

[2:30:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 Because Recruiters are actually the worst.
[2:30:58] <+Tonku_the_Red> You gotta be a 'Merican to apply, Pat!
[2:30:58] <Djinnazz> "It's gonna be ok, I'm from the internet!"

[2:31:07] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> HOSTILE ORB
[2:31:09] <G03933> not as bad as the army streams that offered a free Xbox Elite controller link that just sent you to the recruiting page
[2:31:12] <penitentpentwitch> Time to assert dominance over Orbs once more!
[2:31:13] <heartlesshealer> orb
[2:31:19] <heartlesshealer> consume orb

[2:31:35] <%Garthunox> EVILAK
[2:31:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @G03933 I mean recruiters have been lying to soldiers for decades, why would they stop now?
[2:31:36] <%Movemeister> become as orb
[2:31:37] <spongeofmystery> I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT
[2:31:37] <$lotharrio> Looks like the orb is in the other trashbag full of leaves!

[2:31:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Paige wants all th eorbs
[2:31:40] <dinnydanny777> @commandersqueaks Oh I know, I just question why Gamespot thought that kind of post would ever be well received
[2:31:44] <%ArchimerCXV> i can't wait for the national guard to entice me with exclusive time-based season passes
[2:31:48] <%bread_assassin> Oh, I never did that before.
[2:32:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think the world is finally learning what every soldier has known, recruiters are lying scum who would literally sell their mother's soul to get you to enlist.
[2:32:21] <G03933> @CommanderSqueaks because twitch told them to stop or theyed be forced to remove ban their channel LUL
[2:32:23] <MasterTonberry23> huh a lot of Remedy games deal with a spreading force of corruption, we have the hiss here, the dark prescence in alan wake, and even max payne had the drug valkir
[2:32:27] <heartlesshealer> I like how the orb still runs away from you when it's on your side
[2:32:29] <+twitch_voodoo> the orb is under my command
[2:32:30] <+d00med_magus> did someone say hellow2Majima goo

[2:34:22] <MasterTonberry23> I'm sure everyone will find the Avengers game is wonderful and all the criticism was completely unfounded Kappa
[2:34:35] <%saadi90> No one should play that!
[2:34:36] <Who_lio42> Marvel ma balls
[2:34:36] <%Dementedpenguin> I'd rather play a game that came out 20 years ago.
[2:34:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean to be fair, Kingdom Hearts is literally light so it'd actually be very useful right now.
[2:34:38] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh wait
[2:34:39] <penitentpentwitch> Go find a keyblade to progress

[2:35:42] <$lotharrio> @CommanderSqueaks Hartman also got Hiss corrupted.
[2:35:46] <PanicSwytch> "I know now without a doubt the Kingdom Hearts is light"
[2:35:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> What about poop?

[2:36:06] <MasterTonberry23> So honest question, is Paige Pat's live in nurse?
[2:36:06] <a_mad_dragon> this kills the hiss
[2:36:13] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> The hiss and the dark presence are kinda fighting over who gets to control hartmann
[2:36:43] <madskull456> whats that smell?
[2:36:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean to be fair Dr. Hartman deserves it.
[2:36:50] <madskull456> its PIZZ
[2:36:52] <%Typhaeon> The Hiss, more like The Piss
[2:36:52] <%Nobrev> @MasterTonberry23 much closer to the other way around
[2:36:57] <%Deekman> aw man, I gotta leave work in 30min so i'll miss the end
[2:36:57] <%stabbityrabbit> @MasterTonberry23 It's closer to the other way around really.

[2:44:23] <Robot_Nixon_> gottem
[2:44:26] <upsidedown01> PC LOAD LETTER
[2:44:29] <transporterthesequel> Why would you DO that, why would you copy a DOOM LAKE
[2:44:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ah fuck I meant Landscape, not Portrait, fuck!
[2:44:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> You know what a chain letter would be a perfect OOP
[2:44:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> Those guys got REKT
[2:44:52] <dinnydanny777> Cauldron Lake did nothing wrong
[2:44:56] <SleepyMaribo> man... once you get jessie maxed out this game becomes very different
[2:45:00] <upsidedown01> @MasterTonberry23 so kids can coordinate and mass-fake-purchase tickets to events nobody will attend anyway
[2:45:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SleepyMaribo You're basically a minor deity at this point.
[2:45:19] <Djinnazz> Photocopying is serious business.
[2:45:21] <Reizie_Etherealm> Can you imagine if you don't pass that thing around something bad happens so in the long term you'd need generations of people to pass on that chain letter onto
[2:45:23] <transporterthesequel> Chain letters would be terrifying if they were real
[2:45:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> GUN JEDI ARE REAL
[2:45:27] <%DensityD> number 1 with a bullet

[2:50:58] <penitentpentwitch> @RyTYoung It looks like it's a mechanic for the boss, at least
[2:51:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> so pat is apparently only wearing a shirt?

[2:54:13] <penitentpentwitch> Can you float up to that second floor window in the control room?
[2:54:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MasterTonberry23 thats kinda the point alan wasn't ever a great writer
[2:54:16] <+JingKaisean> @Calek damn, is there a wiki to catch up?
[2:54:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> The plant. Gotta get the plant
[2:54:22] <%Deekman> no you'll find part 2 later
[2:54:24] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt It think is in one of the corners near the office.
[2:54:30] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's page 3, is there a page 2?
[2:54:32] <ape_hawk> im not gamefaqs, look it up yourself
[2:54:37] <%Deekman> it's purposely out of order
[2:54:37] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> that was 3
[2:54:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Maybe the real plant was the friends we made along the way
[2:54:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> Later? Ok
[2:54:42] <%tattleworm> pretty sure part 2's in the other awe area
[2:54:49] <transporterthesequel> Also yes that screenplay is literally Control
[2:54:51] <+Shiso666> right across from big window
[2:55:06] <SaltyAzteca> what about the tunnel
[2:55:08] <Calek> @JingKaisean well I guess all you really need to know is a wirter is trapped in another dimension and everything he writes comes true, and he's trying to write his way to escape
[2:55:16] <+fatbirdtrex> part 2 will show up later, yeah
[2:55:22] <penitentpentwitch> Final plant
[2:55:23] <Calek> @JingKaisean but I highly suggest playing the game, should be relatively cheap these days
[2:55:26] <dukenux> The mold has been plant'd
[2:55:52] <ape_hawk> id like that job
[2:55:57] <SocialMisfitGamer> WHY DOES THAT WORK!?
[2:56:12] <penitentpentwitch> "You have to water, light and talk to the plants."
[2:56:15] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I forget that Jesse is literally still kinda like a child despite being in charge
[2:56:24] <+fatbirdtrex> keep going with ahti's side quests though
[2:56:25] <Ultralazuli> it's weird hearing Jesse sounding so positive and cheeky, she's like a totally different person from the beginning of the game
[2:56:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> ***
[2:56:30] <ape_hawk> look, paige! FOOD!
[2:56:33] <%wizkid50000> wizkid50000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 37 month streak! Wow Pat! It has been so long since I could catch a stream! Control was my GOTY for 2019, so I hope you enjoyed it! I have been loving replaying it on PC which runs WAY Smoother than PS4! Hope you are well!
[2:56:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do not eat the mold
[2:56:41] <G03933> i can hear her drooling now
[2:56:46] <+fatbirdtrex> Jesse is trying her best
[2:56:47] <penitentpentwitch> Paige's hunger increases
[2:56:51] <Calek> but the mold smells so tasty
[2:56:52] <Djinnazz> Mold room a.k.a Paiges Buffet room.
[2:56:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> so jesse is just superpowered paige
[2:57:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> There is mold, Pat is old, Paige is bold, so I'm told
[2:57:03] <+regurgitatedmemes> is this game good?
[2:57:04] <SocialMisfitGamer> That is some mold-ass Mold
[2:57:09] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Moold

[3:01:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> FROM DOWNTOWN
[3:01:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> We know for a fact that he is an asshole.
[3:01:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> monkaS
[3:01:37] <TundraOW> I DEFY YOU HEART MAN
[3:01:39] <Calek> we know for a fact that Hartman is the biggest asshole
[3:01:40] <penitentpentwitch> Behold! The 'correct' way to do this!
[3:01:41] <KnightAsteran> I keep thinking you're talking about Heartman from the Death Stranding
[3:01:43] <%Deekman> lol
[3:01:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> SPIDER TIME
[3:02:11] <Calek> "poor grasp" I highly disagree
[3:02:21] <a_mad_dragon> @PatStaresAt JUST SAY 'REDACTED"
[3:02:29] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> in case anyone forgets or didnt play alan wake hartmann got dozens of innocent people taken to further his research on the shadow and continued his experiments with thomas zane and Wake
[3:02:45] <Djinnazz> so he was just boubin around during reentry
[3:02:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Naw, just say Cyst instead of redacted.
[3:03:07] <%Skittlesoul> it would be fun to do chat mad libs with the black lines
[3:03:10] <dinnydanny777> Just say ____
[3:03:43] <vVAstrAVv> do some kind of thing for redacted stuff just so its followable to the audio only ppl
[3:03:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> WE GOTTA FIGHT THE DARKNESS RIKU
[3:03:46] <Calek> I love that we're getting only the lowest level darkness in this dlc, no taken or anything
[3:03:50] <dinnydanny777> Our _____ are gone, all of our _____ are gone and not just the _____ but the word _____ too
[3:03:57] <$lotharrio> Reduce, reuse, recycle.
[3:04:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Has he gone on a 45 minute monologue as to why he's called Hartman? Wait, wrong Heartman.
[3:04:02] <KnightAsteran> just have elmo scream over every redaction
[3:04:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> Who is the worse edgy character Riku or Sasuke?
[3:04:17] <%Deekman> this bit took me FOREVER I forgot you can pull cubes out of the machines
[3:04:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> No one can see me fight... in the darkness
[3:04:22] <%weissguard> Sasuke
[3:04:25] <ape_hawk> YES
[3:04:27] <Calek> Sasuke, Riku calms down after KH2
[3:04:28] <ape_hawk> THIS QUEST
[3:04:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @BallerSwagBro9k Riku is only a shit in the first game.
[3:04:31] <%cvp5127> riku got better
[3:04:33] <$lotharrio> Spider Time!
[3:04:34] <KnightAsteran> Riku actually becomes a decent person
[3:04:34] <penitentpentwitch> It's nice that he's not just digging through the walls to destroy the cabling so there'd be no lights.
[3:04:34] <Djinnazz> oh yes!
[3:04:35] <dinnydanny777> Riku becomes less edgy
[3:04:39] <$moforussia> LUL yes
[3:04:40] <%stabbityrabbit> @BallerSwagBro9k Sasuke, hands down.
[3:04:40] <Calek> BEST SIDE QUEST

[3:21:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, you're basically listening to your own podcast.
[3:22:01] <MasterTonberry23> Do you people all love Langston because youre as socially awkward as he is? Just askin
[3:22:05] <%AncelDeLambert> I think "factory" might be an exageration
[3:22:05] <%RyTYoung> @cruel_tentacles No way! Where about?
[3:22:06] <$RealThiele> he had to find gief for the pee break
[3:22:06] <+CourageTheCat> LMAO
[3:22:08] <%Deekman> yeah they're hand made at a factory
[3:22:08] <%Ipsenscastle> bagpipes grow in the sea
[3:22:11] <+razielhex> this was just a CSB bit
[3:22:13] <Cruel_Tentacles> Yeah, I live in Scotland. We used CNC machines to make them.
[3:22:14] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> i like bagpipes
[3:22:15] <dinnydanny777> Do Kazoo factories exist?
[3:22:16] <%koolaid_kevster> BAGPOIPES LOOK COOL!
[3:22:19] <Undenizen> you would be SHOCKED how many people play bagpipes.
[3:22:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat your bassically a human version of a bagpipe
[3:22:20] <%rdark_ksu> fuck you bagpipes rock
[3:22:20] <%AncelDeLambert> NO FUCK YOU BAGPIPES ARE GREAT!
[3:22:20] <%RyTYoung> BAGPIPES ARE SICK PAT FUCK YOU
[3:22:22] <%Dementedpenguin> Pat vs Bagpipes
[3:22:25] <%Totally_Not_Toby> imagine thinking the Bagpipes are bad
[3:22:25] <+CourageTheCat> they shoot FIRE sometimes
[3:22:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> someone has to make bagpipes pat
[3:22:28] <+ianabstract> Remember when the Berserk anime used bagpipe synths
[3:22:32] <RichochetForce> @MasterTonberry23 He's entertaining to listen to. The neuroses is funny
[3:22:33] <%RyTYoung> @cruel_tentacles That's awesome!
[3:22:35] <%Typhaeon> Highland pipes can get fucked, Uilleann pipes are where it's at
[3:22:36] <Cruel_Tentacles> Bagpipes are horrible. You are correct.
[3:22:38] <%Mr_Pylon> Bagpipes are fun but the best instrument is the didgeridoo
[3:22:39] <Tooniearcade> Wow
[3:22:39] <$RealThiele> your FF14 hat says fuck you
[3:22:45] <raikagelord1> Pat’s new Twitter handle.
[3:22:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat hates bag-pipes cause he hates the idea of something else being filled with more hot gas than him.
[3:22:47] <%reonome> yes
[3:22:52] <+Punchasaur> I’m Irish and even I hate bagpipes
[3:22:53] <$lotharrio> No, Pat... yours WILL.
[3:22:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> I need an accordion and two gallons of whiskey
[3:22:55] <%tanarath> bagpipes are great due to crazy talk
[3:23:01] <Cruel_Tentacles> @rytyoung Thanks.
[3:23:07] <+razielhex> Pat wouldn't even exist without bagpipes. Without some kilt-wearing laddie swooning a gaelic lass with the noble bagpipe, there'd be no progenitors to spawn him.
[3:23:09] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat would totally use a bagpipe as his intrusment
[3:23:10] <%RyTYoung> I mean Bagpipes are super loud, they sound fine at a long distance away LUL
[3:23:15] <Undenizen> you wanna talk about obscure instruments there's a thing called a Hurdy Gurdy that was like the sicket shit in the 1400s.
[3:23:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CommanderSqueaks full of hot air and making constant noise
[3:23:20] <KnightAsteran> @punchasaur yeah but we've got those bellows bagpipes instead
[3:23:34] <%Totally_Not_Toby> pat's child will have its mother's desire to eat garbage coupled with his repulsion of it
[3:23:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @doc_ock_rokc Pat's Fursona is basically a bagpipe.
[3:23:40] <%Totally_Not_Toby> a constant inner battle

[3:24:04] <upsidedown01> Just throw a fucking forklift at them, that works LUL
[3:24:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RealThiele Should have bagpipes in it.
[3:24:19] <upsidedown01> OR A BODY LUL LUL
[3:24:23] <+epoladia> yo this game looks sick
[3:24:28] <dinnydanny777> Kazoo > Bagpipes
[3:24:30] <$RealThiele> LUL
[3:24:31] <%RyTYoung> @realthiele yeah it definitely could, there is some stronger bgm in other sections of the game, just not enough
[3:24:31] <Kaijuboy> Of course Paige loves garbage. She’s with Pat! 😜 I KID! I KID!
[3:24:39] <upsidedown01> did that fucker just TWERK and dodge your shit
[3:24:40] <dinnydanny777> In fact Kazoo > All instruments
[3:24:55] <%Deekman> lol i gotta try and unlock multigrab
[3:24:56] <%Afterman_> bass guitar best instrument
[3:25:02] <Undenizen> this game is PRETTY sick. combat is a little repetitive but it's got a crazy good story
[3:25:03] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a little nutty that the Hiss STILL has soldiers to throw at you. You must have killed half the security team by now, if not more
[3:25:22] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> RAGING_1NF3RNO subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Simping for them graphics cards, Pat? Those new ones look amazing.
[3:25:25] <RichochetForce> The bureau is massive
[3:25:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AncelDeLambert FBC has a REALLY HIGH security personnel budget.
[3:25:28] <Undenizen> @AncelDeLambert oh yeah you've killed a small ARMY by now
[3:25:33] <RichochetForce> There could easily be 10,000+ Hiss
[3:25:35] <Cruel_Tentacles> What even is the story of the game at this point?

[3:29:57] <$RealThiele> Ozma must be sated
[3:30:01] <KnightAsteran> @cruel_tentacles she's called a "Parautilitarian" which means she can bind objects of power to her and use their abilities

[3:30:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Zangief has just discovered a fun new game. "How much shit can I knock off the table."
[3:30:51] <Undenizen> it means she has MAGIC POWERS

[3:30:58] <ape_hawk> and ahti is her mentor
[3:31:05] <Cruel_Tentacles> @knightasteran That sounds sick. I need to buy this game.

[3:31:20] <%RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks He's playing puppy bowling
[3:31:23] <Undenizen> Guess what! if you get TOO MANY magic powers, you literally turn radioactive and become *a problem*
[3:31:29] <upsidedown01> @Cruel_Tentacles this game happens in a building larger on the inside and older than the world, full of crazy X-Files paranormal eldritch bullshit and rules that make sense in exactly the wrong way, and most of it is creepy but a good chunk of it is the funny kind of weird
[3:31:33] <$lotharrio> A floppy disk with clod war era "launch" codes in it.
[3:31:55] <Calek> @Undenizen then you become super useful and become the sole battery of a magic house
[3:31:57] <Undenizen> tv that makes you fly.
[3:32:07] <RichochetForce> These Dead Letters are infinitely amusing
[3:32:10] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe, maybe not. Jesse is canonically "augmented" to be more capable with the bullshit powers of this world

[3:33:58] <upsidedown01> @Cruel_Tentacles also Jesse's "gun" is not actually a gun, it's a member of the same class of epic saga weapons as Excalibur and Mjolnir and Masamune, she is just the person wielding the gun which is also the building which is also her destiny as Overseer of the Board, and this sentence makes sense because the Oldest House says so
[3:34:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is he going to try and drink his own pee? What the hell?

[3:34:17] <vVAstrAVv> boy cark would love it here

[3:34:56] <%king_wragles> Look at the bright side, at least Zangief doesn't play in his own piss
[3:34:58] <Robot_Nixon_> More like ZanGRIEF amirite?
[3:34:59] <Undenizen> @Cruel_Tentacles anyway, the core game involves Jessie taking down a sentient resonance. which is a fucking amazing idea for an antagonist.

[3:35:37] <%RyTYoung> @rumtumtugnutz LUL
[3:35:41] <upsidedown01> @Cruel_Tentacles also the building is run by a black pyramid that talks to her in an unknowable alien language whose subtitles don't even agree with each other
[3:35:48] <RichochetForce> @Cruel_Tentacles There's a safe in the game that is impossible to open, leaks blood of an unknown life form, and according to x-ray scans has something moving around in it.
[3:35:48] <+Grandnatics> Pat is paying for all the water Zangief needs to drink so he can pee more
[3:35:51] <clockworknait1> wow just wait until he grows and see how they deal with him then lol

[3:36:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> So how long until Pat gets up to go do something and he comes back to sit in a pile of piss during stream?
[3:36:59] <RichochetForce> @Cruel_Tentacles I grabbed it for $27 on GreenManGaming

[3:37:34] <heartlesshealer> clap
[3:37:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> We saved Peach Saliva.
[3:37:34] <upsidedown01> I hate the mold
[3:37:37] <upsidedown01> So creepy
[3:37:38] <clockworknait1> Aw dammit I sat in a pile a piss , well gotta end the stream early guys
[3:37:39] <thenamelessant> did you reach the Alan Wake stuff yet?
[3:37:46] <$joylent_blue> the amount of piss and poop will seem to reduce as he learns to hold it in
[3:37:48] <$RealThiele> whre is paige she can eat this room
[3:37:49] <$joylent_blue> until then get fucked
[3:37:53] <heartlesshealer> now just finish darkness to complete all three
[3:37:53] <%RyTYoung> You should have a unique gun mod
[3:38:15] <%Totally_Not_Toby> this is clearly nightvale
[3:38:23] <upsidedown01> The mold gives off spores and scents that make you want to eat it and then you turn into mold and spread yourself LUL
[3:38:25] <%Deekman> i love wake's flowery language
[3:38:31] <SaltyAzteca> CONTROL YOURSELF, HA
[3:38:36] <ape_hawk> yes
[3:38:38] <+CourageTheCat> OOPS
[3:38:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dammit Alan.
[3:38:41] <%reonome> dammit alan
[3:38:41] <heartlesshealer> dammit Alan
[3:38:42] <+Javaa01> Well no, that's the Former
[3:38:43] <upsidedown01> @Totally_Not_Toby this is totally roughly the same genre as nightvale, yes XD
[3:38:44] <$RealThiele> he said the word!
[3:38:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> BORK
[3:38:47] <KnightAsteran> Alan created the concept of alternate reality
[3:38:51] <%RyTYoung> Alan You fool
[3:38:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> BARK I SAY
[3:38:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> he's peeing again
[3:38:59] <clockworknait1> mods get saved up and when you empty they replace
[3:39:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> arf
[3:39:00] <ape_hawk> which means he basically committed MASS MURDER just for a chance to free himself
[3:39:01] <$joylent_blue> YIP YAP
[3:39:01] <%tattleworm> unique mod's for doing all of ahti's stuff
[3:39:05] <%BinaryFireball> awww zngeiiif
[3:39:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Don't blame Alan he was writen by another writer
[3:39:09] <%Totally_Not_Toby> no that screenplay specifically
[3:39:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> BARK BORK BARK
[3:39:14] <transporterthesequel> He also created the FBC!
[3:39:15] <%Totally_Not_Toby> or page or whatever
[3:39:16] <upsidedown01> @Cruel_Tentacles also Alan Wake shares this universe, his typewriter is an Object Of Power or some shit
[3:39:21] <$RealThiele> So Alan Wake is a Ascian
[3:39:28] <upsidedown01> whaaaaat
[3:39:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Alan wrote all of this.
[3:39:30] <Undenizen> ehhh. I don't like games where EVERYTHING is connected to a single event.
[3:39:32] <upsidedown01> is that canon
[3:39:33] <upsidedown01> how
[3:39:33] <penitentpentwitch> RNG upgrades as a reward is a terrible system~
[3:39:37] <upsidedown01> holy fuck
[3:39:39] <ape_hawk> The Typewriter = The Loom of Fate, yes
[3:39:39] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> oh yeah this shit
[3:39:40] <HorribleHog> Do you have this... under control? haHAA
[3:39:40] <%RyTYoung> Yah the fact Alan was created by another writer is a bit nutty
[3:39:40] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Zangief wept, for there was no more pees to pee
[3:39:42] <thenamelessant> Alan created a weird paradox where Zane created him so Alan can will Zane into reality
[3:39:47] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> TUBES
[3:39:47] <transporterthesequel> He’s literally writing this DLC right now
[3:39:48] <Calek> Alan Wake created the Hiss but the Dark Place made them evil
[3:39:51] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> er WIRE
[3:39:52] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[3:39:53] <+fatbirdtrex> got to finish all of ahti's stuff, so the darkness stuff too
[3:39:57] <upsidedown01> holy shit, paradox LUL
[3:39:59] <+Delenay> they are just skeletons
[3:40:17] <upsidedown01> I love batshit lore LUL
[3:40:22] <$RealThiele> big suicide
[3:40:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Doesn't he have a crate you can put him in?
[3:40:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Zangief without a target will grapple himself
[3:40:27] <$joylent_blue> the Gief gene was not made for scholars
[3:40:28] <%tanarath> no
[3:40:33] <upsidedown01> Because ANYTHING COULD BE REAL in this place
[3:40:33] <HorribleHog> not only skeletons
[3:40:35] <thenamelessant> don't show paige the skeletons
[3:40:35] <%RyTYoung> this happened a while ago too
[3:40:35] <upsidedown01> ANY RULE GOES
[3:40:36] <penitentpentwitch> Lost their lower jaws too
[3:40:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> they have no jaw
[3:40:38] <%Deekman> they've been here 2 years
[3:40:44] <%Jeemukun> sounds like my dog whenever we put him outside on his rope
[3:40:44] <%reonome> i can hear paige splooshing
[3:40:45] <ToneBacas> that shit won't fly when he reaches his full potential
[3:40:52] <%tanarath> @patstaresat He wants attention.
[3:40:52] <dinnydanny777> Imagine being made out of bones, couldn't be me
[3:40:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why no put dog in crate when personal time need? Those were words.
[3:40:55] <%Doruben> psaBlind
[3:40:56] <+Javaa01> No, that's orange
[3:41:06] <SirKeigan> Are you talking about Paige?
[3:41:10] <%Deekman> one is red
[3:41:13] <%Deekman> one is orange
[3:41:14] <%RyTYoung> orange
[3:41:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> COLORS ARE HARD
[3:41:15] <SirKeigan> Paige can't walk backwards?
[3:41:15] <upsidedown01> Mix and match your shit, Pat
[3:41:17] <$RealThiele> paige is too weak for crate
[3:41:19] <%ArchimerCXV> ornj
[3:41:22] <$joylent_blue> something wrong with that boy
[3:41:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, Purple
[3:41:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> color blind
[3:41:24] <%코코꾸라> orange you glad you noticed?
[3:41:25] <penitentpentwitch> Oh now, we're walking into a 'purple' joke aren't we?
[3:41:25] <Cherokia666> No, it's Purple
[3:41:27] <upsidedown01> I wonder if this game has colorblind settings
[3:41:33] <dinnydanny777> Ore enj
[3:41:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> No it's Purple, Pat
[3:41:38] <%tanarath> Dogs can learn to deal with leashes, he just doesn't want to deal with it himself.
[3:41:42] <%Jekado> this cable management is bothering me
[3:41:44] <%Deekman> lmao
[3:41:45] <%Capta1n_H3nry> No Pat it's purple
[3:41:47] <%astrophizz> I forgot Pat can't see color
[3:41:48] <%코코꾸라> orng
[3:41:49] <%Totally_Not_Toby> ornj
[3:41:51] <upsidedown01> Grab a lamp
[3:41:52] <%Totally_Not_Toby> it's true
[3:41:53] <%Aleate> Orng
[3:41:54] <PanicSwytch> Orng
[3:41:54] <%RyTYoung> ornge
[3:41:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat do you literally have a problem separating color shades?
[3:41:57] <clockworknait1> 100% of all dogs that pee too much eventually die someday
[3:41:57] <%Jaxnos> rmember everyone, Pat isn't colorblind.
[3:41:58] <%Totally_Not_Toby> that's how you say it
[3:41:59] <RichochetForce> FBC needs cable ties.
[3:42:00] <Undenizen> why would they design it like this?
[3:42:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat is learning colors
[3:42:14] <upsidedown01> r/cableporn is weeping
[3:42:16] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat youre a ginger what color is your hair?
[3:42:17] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Ornge
[3:42:19] <SirKeigan> I'm so colorblind this hurts
[3:42:20] <ToneBacas> even if you were color blind you could probably trace along the cables and figure it out by the way they're laid out
[3:42:27] <penitentpentwitch> You have a blue one
[3:42:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Does Pat actually have a problem differentiating colors?
[3:42:36] <Cherokia666> yes
[3:42:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Are you stealing Paiges schtick?
[3:42:37] <%Garthunox> ornge you glad I didnt say banana
[3:42:46] <$RealThiele> Uri-Ornj-eh?
[3:42:46] <SirKeigan> O R G N E
[3:42:47] <+Grandnatics> Is Pat a disabled?
[3:42:50] <KnightAsteran> @undenizen higher technology literally fucking explodes when entering the house
[3:42:50] <SirKeigan> O R N G E
[3:42:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> They have the same SHTICK
[3:42:53] <Undenizen> why would you need enormous generators to open a GATE?
[3:42:53] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Pat big brain
[3:42:55] <$lotharrio> Schtick-Sisters?
[3:42:56] <%Ipsenscastle> ornj
[3:42:59] <ape_hawk> you some kinda Schtick Schtealer?
[3:43:00] <%Totally_Not_Toby> pat has the biggest schtick
[3:43:01] <Cherokia666> Everyone in that house is disabled
[3:43:02] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> being dumb?
[3:43:02] <penitentpentwitch> Steal? No. Copy? Absolutely.
[3:43:04] <SirKeigan> ornje
[3:43:10] <Undenizen> what's wrong with a lock?
[3:43:13] <%RyTYoung> S C H T I C K S T E A L
[3:43:15] <dinnydanny777> Ornjestein and Smough
[3:43:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean it makes sense since you're both clones.
[3:43:15] <+Javaa01> There's still one more color
[3:43:18] <$RealThiele> Paige is infecting him with mold, she is absorbing HIS bits
[3:43:23] <RichochetForce> Yup, smart phones blew up in people's pockets as they entered the building
[3:43:23] <clockworknait1> @grandnatics I don't think he was ever enabled
[3:43:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Y E L L O W
[3:43:25] <$joylent_blue> i said it :)
[3:43:29] <%Aleate> You said this? I said this :)
[3:43:29] <%Rumbutt> if your schtick is steal others' schticks, then is it really stealing schticks, or is it just YOUR schtick?
[3:43:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> WALL
[3:43:33] <$lotharrio> Jelly
[3:43:35] <RichochetForce> It's implied the building doesn't like "smart" things.
[3:43:37] <dinnydanny777> It was all yellow
[3:43:42] <SocialMisfitGamer> Pat: The Puzzle Man
[3:43:44] <%RyTYoung> Red and orng and yelo and blu
[3:43:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you've grabbed that computer 10 times
[3:43:55] <clockworknait1> I think the mods from foundation ruined the mods in awe
[3:44:00] <Undenizen> does that mean it *likes* things that are idiotic?
[3:44:02] <Daxalog> Is this a transformers situation where you got lucky with mods at the beginning?
[3:44:06] <$RealThiele> Water temple sends its regards.
[3:44:08] <upsidedown01> AQUATIC MISCONDUCT
[3:44:11] <penitentpentwitch> Something to play for Zangief
[3:44:15] <upsidedown01> ZANGIEF I'M LOOKING AT YOU BUDDY
[3:44:16] <dinnydanny777> What's an aquatic misconduct
[3:44:23] <%Deekman> it'll repair itself
[3:44:25] <+Javaa01> The house fixes itself
[3:44:29] <+Tonku_the_Red> I need to find a way to use "aquatic misconduct" in my life.
[3:44:30] <Undenizen> I suspect the house heals itself
[3:44:32] <%tattleworm> the oldest house has it covered
[3:44:32] <clockworknait1> the house will shift and fix itself
[3:44:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt The oldes't house self repairs
[3:44:32] <penitentpentwitch> TBF, it's implied the walls can 'heal'
[3:44:32] <%miguelrod777> they expect it at this point
[3:44:33] <+CourageTheCat> it'll grow back
[3:44:35] <RichochetForce> The house fixes itself
[3:44:35] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> The house probably repairs itself somehow
[3:44:36] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat the oldest house literally fixes itself
[3:44:38] <Daxalog> The building is probably self repairing.
[3:44:38] <ape_hawk> the house literally repairs itself
[3:44:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 I imagine it means if you use 3 faucets it'll flood cause it'd be funny.
[3:44:40] <a_mad_dragon> the building fixes itself
[3:44:44] <$lotharrio> @Daxalog It's more that the DLCs added mods that are only situationally useful.
[3:44:44] <+Solutha> the house is magic
[3:44:46] <Psyramics> she's the Director, they can be pissed at her all they like, what are they gonna do?
[3:44:46] <heartlesshealer> Don't the walls heal when no one's in the room?
[3:44:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, the only maintenance employee is Ahti.
[3:44:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> The house repairs itself.
[3:44:57] <$RealThiele> i suspect less of fix, and more of grow more rooms
[3:45:01] <RichochetForce> @heartlesshealer Yes
[3:45:02] <clockworknait1> I love how everyone and chat thinks what pat can't
[3:45:09] <upsidedown01> Ahti IS the staff
[3:45:15] <dinnydanny777> Oh yeah there's a cleaner guy
[3:45:15] <KnightAsteran> Jesse is the janitors assistant tho
[3:45:18] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 Ah yes. Hello, it is kirby. Hello. I see you are playing game. I enjoy game. I hope you enjoy game too. Okay bye.
[3:45:21] <upsidedown01> Ahti IS the building's sense of how clean it is at any given moment
[3:45:32] <+Estuko> monkaS
[3:45:34] <lobso123> I bought this game day one and played it for a hour total. What’s the main pull? It was an slow start for me
[3:45:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @KnightAsteran I'm suspecting that being the Director actually is being Ahti's assistant.
[3:45:38] <Undenizen> @upsidedown01 i think Ahti is the House.
[3:45:39] <dukenux> Ahti cleans up what the House itself doesn't
[3:45:43] <upsidedown01> Grab a lamp O_O
[3:45:44] <dukenux> Heart Man?
[3:45:46] <$lotharrio> Spider time.
[3:45:47] <heartlesshealer> oh no
[3:45:50] <+Tonku_the_Red> Would you like to see Heartman's heart-shaped heart?
[3:45:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lobso123 The lore
[3:45:52] <upsidedown01> Ahti may indeed be the House
[3:45:57] <KnightAsteran> @commandersqueaks I wouldn't be surprised
[3:45:59] <$RealThiele> SCP + Alan wake in a decent shooter is the draw
[3:45:59] <upsidedown01> It is intentionally left unclear
[3:46:01] <dukenux> wtf was that
[3:46:04] <upsidedown01> A lot of shit is intentionally left unclear
[3:46:05] <clockworknait1> I think ahti is the actual projection of the oldest house itself
[3:46:06] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat remembers that he needs to stay in the light
[3:46:13] <dinnydanny777> That's a very scary heartless
[3:46:21] <+Punchasaur> The house is the world tree
[3:46:28] <RichochetForce> There was a line from The Board early in the game that hinted that they knew of Jesse carrying Polaris with her.
[3:46:31] <dukenux> Ahti and the House are the same being in two personas?
[3:46:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @upsidedown01 Ahti is literally the name of the Finnish God of the Depths, so Ahti may literally be a god.
[3:46:36] <RichochetForce> I smiled when I saw someone mention that
[3:46:39] <dukenux> A Holy Duality if you will
[3:46:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Die hardman
[3:46:50] <Cherokia666> genious kojumbo
[3:46:56] <%D00msDayDan> would you like to see heartman's man-shaped man?
[3:46:59] <$lotharrio> I thought you were making a South Park reference. Gene Hack-Man.
[3:47:05] <%Aleate> The wall :)
[3:47:05] <%Deekman> he's shooting heartman
[3:47:06] <Mr_Strut> bwaann
[3:47:08] <dukenux> Subway Cart Man
[3:47:09] <%tattleworm> this game's hartman is considerably less attractive
[3:47:19] <Undenizen> I could NOT take "die hardman" seriously no matter how many times i heard it
[3:47:19] <Cherokia666> What if HeartMan was shaped like a Heart?
[3:47:32] <%Deekman> love this
[3:47:32] <dukenux> Tell Tale Heartman
[3:47:36] <%tattleworm> train train train
[3:47:39] <RichochetForce> Pursue DieHartman.
[3:47:39] <transporterthesequel> Hello what

[3:47:43] <%Aleate> monkaS
[3:47:44] <%RyTYoung> I haven't done this part yet
[3:47:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is this just Murder on the Orient?
[3:47:49] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> GG
[3:47:58] <$RealThiele> If this is Yggdrasil, then it makes sense that the tree would grow new "roots" as Jormangandr, the world serpent nibbles at them
[3:47:58] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Find the right order!
[3:47:59] <%Deekman> puzzle time
[3:47:59] <%RyTYoung> huh
[3:47:59] <dukenux> Death was in the air on the Roscoe St. Station~
[3:48:07] <dinnydanny777> Are we going to Chicago?
[3:48:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> W I D E T R A I N
[3:48:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jaaaaazz
[3:48:16] <Undenizen> this doesn't seem very paranormal. was teleporting into the train really neccessary?
[3:48:18] <%RyTYoung> yeah we missed that

[3:48:30] <dukenux> skibbidoodap
[3:48:31] <Cherokia666> I honestly looked up a guide for this one since I couldn't be assed
[3:48:34] <lobso123> Just lore? People refer to this as one of the greatest games of the decade. Nothing gameplay wise sets this apart?
[3:48:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love how much SPACE this train has.
[3:48:43] <%RyTYoung> The Simpsoooons
[3:48:51] <NeroInfinite> Hahaha dog go nyoom
[3:48:54] <Undenizen> monoraiiiil
[3:48:55] <dukenux> That's a wide train cart
[3:49:01] <%Deekman> NOW SOLVE IT!
[3:49:06] <Robot_Nixon_> monkaS
[3:49:06] <upsidedown01> damn O_O
[3:49:08] <Calek> I'm a huge Remedy and Alan Wake fanboy, and I wouldn't even call this the game of the decade, wasn't even game of the year
[3:49:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> It sounds like things didn't go well.
[3:49:09] <snorlaxbud> train car do be big
[3:49:10] <Undenizen> it's REALLY wide
[3:49:10] <SaltyAzteca> Escalation. Quickly.
[3:49:10] <dinnydanny777> Springfield is an OoP
[3:49:12] <Louie_Salmon> Wow, spoilers subtitles
[3:49:14] <+Javaa01> Figure out the timeline
[3:49:15] <dukenux> Is this the prequel to Unbreakable
[3:49:20] <penitentpentwitch> Have to play them in order?
[3:49:20] <RichochetForce> Uh, wow.
[3:49:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Now connect the right order
[3:49:25] <+KingpinLarry> Do it in order from beginning to crash
[3:49:27] <upsidedown01> what do these objects mean
[3:49:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> @dukenux yes
[3:49:34] <Cherokia666> Yeah. there's an order
[3:49:38] <%Aleate> SourPls
[3:49:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> WRONG
[3:49:41] <Undenizen> they appear to be in chronological order already?
[3:49:48] <%Deekman> @PatStaresAt listen in order
[3:49:48] <SaltyAzteca> LOUD NOISES
[3:50:00] <+Estuko> PogChamp Spring field
[3:50:01] <+KingpinLarry> You got to listen closely
[3:50:03] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Wrong again pat!
[3:50:06] <%D00msDayDan> how can this BE
[3:50:14] <+Javaa01> Still wrong
[3:50:18] <%cowardman93> pat slow down
[3:50:18] <upsidedown01> huh
[3:50:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> BRUTE FORCE
[3:50:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt randomly pressing buttons isn't a puzzle solving
[3:50:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> BRUUUUTE FORCE
[3:50:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:50:25] <ToneBacas> brute-force is hardly doing a puzzle, but this is not your fault
[3:50:25] <Undenizen> i dont think i like this puzzle. the objective isn't clear at all.
[3:50:30] <+dmtjinni> ???
[3:50:30] <%Aleate> No do it faster
[3:50:30] <%Jekado> time to brute force it
[3:50:32] <dukenux> Brute force it LUL

[4:00:04] <$lotharrio> Pat solved the videogame!
[4:00:04] <dinnydanny777> Why does that platform seem to be in a pitch black void
[4:00:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> BIG RED
[4:00:14] <%bread_assassin> I missed all of this.
[4:00:14] <%CrookedSpiral> psaBig psaBig psaBig
[4:00:19] <heartlesshealer> multi launch so good
[4:00:25] <%Mr_Pylon> Watch out for Kane
[4:00:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat's resolve has been tested.
[4:00:27] <upsidedown01> What's the largest object you can throw at someone
[4:00:31] <%DedlokPM> He's not talking so he can seamlessly edit that he died out of the Youtube Upload. teenJOY
[4:00:32] <+dmtjinni> yeahright...
[4:00:34] <Undenizen> @dinnydanny777 this is the most pressing question you had?
[4:00:37] <$RealThiele> pat solved videogames like that pepsi girl solved racism
[4:00:44] <%RyTYoung> Yeah forklift is the biggest
[4:00:44] <RichochetForce> @upsidedown01 Forklift
[4:00:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DedlokPM He doesn't edit his videos, silly.
[4:00:52] <Calek> she can lift at least 1500 pounds with that power
[4:00:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> they tried to throw pat but it can't be lifted
[4:01:00] <upsidedown01> oh shit I saw him do that earlier XD
[4:01:01] <RichochetForce> Yes
[4:01:02] <+dmtjinni> wrong
[4:01:05] <hcsarg1986> Pat Have you played the Avengers Beta yet?
[4:01:06] <upsidedown01> in a place with a girder bridge
[4:01:07] <%DedlokPM> @CommanderSqueaks this one he will. teenJOY
[4:01:09] <%Zalthia> She triiiiieed to kill me with a fork lift!
[4:01:22] <RichochetForce> She also hurls things at tremendous speed
[4:01:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> But can she lift a star destroyer though?
[4:01:29] <SaltyAzteca> Its the red room Kappa
[4:01:31] <RichochetForce> That forklift was probably moving at 100mph
[4:01:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> @hcsarg1986 hes not gonna play that garbage game
[4:01:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> This makes me want to devolop photos
[4:01:38] <upsidedown01> Have you found the mirror dimension yet
[4:01:40] <heartlesshealer> enjoy
[4:01:41] <upsidedown01> and esseJ
[4:01:44] <$RealThiele> that avenger game just reeks of Marvel Gacha
[4:01:51] <Undenizen> you know, any house that has "a red room" is usually pretty nice.
[4:01:54] <+Estuko> @Reizie_Etherealm I mean... it's gota be AT LEAST 1500lbs..
[4:01:55] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt did you know league just put out a champ that is just dante from DMC?
[4:01:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Isn't Pat playing Tony Hawk on Friday or did that change?
[4:02:00] <RichochetForce> @upsidedown01 He's wearing the outfit already
[4:02:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> RED ROOM RED RUM
[4:02:19] <%Jaxnos> comfy motel time
[4:02:21] <dukenux> neat
[4:02:23] <upsidedown01> oh!
[4:02:27] <Cherokia666> I didn't get this, so this is interesting.
[4:02:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> @commandersqueaks he changed it cuz copyright music
[4:02:28] <heartlesshealer> Aerobics
[4:02:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's a good one
[4:02:38] <+Javaa01> Free health
[4:02:39] <heartlesshealer> dodge health
[4:02:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's a really good one.
[4:02:42] <RichochetForce> Mod acquired: Calisthenics
[4:02:44] <%RyTYoung> indeed
[4:02:45] <hcsarg1986> @BallerSwagBro9k I mean I heard it had problems but I didn't think it was that bad.
[4:02:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did it say 50% health?
[4:02:55] <dinnydanny777> If Jesse left the building could she fly?
[4:02:59] <SaltyAzteca> eyyy
[4:03:06] <upsidedown01> Odin and Tor :D
[4:03:06] <%Aleate> psaDogchamp Our boy
[4:03:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oden and TOR! YEAH
[4:03:20] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:03:20] <$RealThiele> Boi
[4:03:29] <dukenux> Man, does this game have a "backrooms" type of area. Cause it would fit REALLY well into it.
[4:03:31] <Undenizen> what a fuckin nerd
[4:03:34] <+dmtjinni> weirdest game pat ever streamed
[4:03:43] <+CourageTheCat> @dinnydanny777 i think it's less that she "flies" and more than she force pushes off the ground
[4:03:48] <+CourageTheCat> so she could only probably go so high
[4:03:51] <%PhysicsLB> what is this? Is that Alan Wake?
[4:03:55] <$RealThiele> P5 is more weird than this imo
[4:03:57] <%Zalthia> Barry...
[4:04:02] <upsidedown01> @PhysicsLB yyyup
[4:04:03] <Undenizen> oh man there SHOULD be a backrooms. my only worry is it would be too similar to the normal Oldest House
[4:04:05] <dinnydanny777> @couragethecat But do her powers work outside the building, I mean?
[4:04:08] <Calek> o7 Odin and Tor Andersons
[4:04:15] <+CourageTheCat> I think so
[4:04:21] <a_mad_dragon> a hunting and pecking typist? LUL
[4:04:22] <+evbites> Wtf is he talking about
[4:04:26] <hcsarg1986> Alan Wake?
[4:04:35] <dukenux> Death Stranding is still weirder, when it comes to recent releases, imho
[4:04:46] <dinnydanny777> I remember that concert part in Alan Wake
[4:04:47] <%Zalthia> Awwwwwwwwwwww
[4:04:50] <dukenux> Although that's also down to it being less comprehensible LUL
[4:04:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Awwwww.
[4:04:51] <$RealThiele> hes been gone for 10 years because of his slow-ass typing skills
[4:04:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wheeler is a good boy.
[4:05:00] <%Zalthia> AWWWW
[4:05:04] <%RyTYoung> that's nice
[4:05:06] <RichochetForce> Awesome
[4:05:08] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt did you know league just put out a champ that is just dante from DMC? (even with a combo meter and taunts)
[4:05:09] <%DedlokPM> @evbites those 2 guys that were the band that was in Alan Wake
[4:05:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Alan still is working to make barry happy
[4:05:10] <Calek> Barry Wheeler can do no wrong
[4:05:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> I thought Barry wasn't real.....
[4:05:13] <artoflec> is this what is happening to GRRM right now too
[4:05:24] <%Zalthia> Barry was always real
[4:05:26] <%CaityCoopScoops> CaityCoopScoops subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! holy shit 17 mumfs!! have a lovely stream and say hello to the baby puppy and elmo and peeeech
[4:05:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @marlborored5 That's the third time you've posted that identical message.
[4:05:31] <RichochetForce> @artoflec Probably
[4:05:33] <Undenizen> @BallerSwagBro9k of course they're not real. It's a video game.
[4:05:37] <%Zalthia> Its Alan who may have been created by Zane
[4:05:37] <$RealThiele> GRRM breaking reality rahte rthan writing faster? id buy it
[4:05:40] <%DedlokPM> @BallerSwagBro9k barry was real and was Alan's agent
[4:05:45] <+JustToWatch> what the fuck my aerobics mod is only +10, how did Pat get +50?
[4:05:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> @artoflec no cuz GRRM is typing LUL
[4:05:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> isnt
[4:05:58] <+pkmamsters> Pod People

[4:06:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> POD PEOPLE
[4:06:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Zalthia Or Alan created Zane. Shit's screwy.
[4:06:17] <dinnydanny777> Well did they let out a high pitched scream?
[4:06:18] <$lotharrio> Might be early Hiss infection.
[4:06:28] <heartlesshealer> See ------ for full report
[4:06:37] <+pkmamsters> P.O.D. (People of Descent)
[4:06:41] <+JustToWatch> @Djinnazz are you on ps4 or pc?
[4:06:49] <%Zalthia> @commandersqueaks Its like the chicken and the egg. An ouroboros of who created who.
[4:06:52] <Djinnazz> @CommanderSqueaks No, Zanes real, or was anyway.
[4:07:05] <Calek> Alan can't create things, he just takes the domino pieces that already exists and knock them over
[4:07:06] <Djinnazz> @JustToWatch PS4
[4:07:09] <%RyTYoung> That's the guy from the audio tape from beforw
[4:07:11] <upsidedown01> remind me what SHUM is?
[4:07:14] <heartlesshealer> was
[4:07:16] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> So pat gets a mod that gives him 50% when he evades but i got a fucking 10% one.... wtf
[4:07:20] <%reonome> shüm

[4:07:26] <ape_hawk> almost done
[4:07:26] <%RyTYoung> You don't have long to go
[4:07:28] <Djinnazz> little more than half way
[4:07:28] <Calek> @PatStaresAt you're almost done
[4:07:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> SHUM
[4:07:30] <Louie_Salmon> Holy shit, I'm gonna shüm

[4:07:36] <%RyTYoung> Yeah
[4:07:36] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Halfway through
[4:07:37] <%bread_assassin> Likw 70%
[4:07:40] <+KingpinLarry> More than half way
[4:07:41] <%Beough> yeah this is pretty short
[4:07:43] <RichochetForce> Yup
[4:07:43] <Cherokia666> Yeah, almost done
[4:07:46] <%Aleate> Forklift psaDogchamp
[4:07:48] <upsidedown01> oh right it was the arcade or something
[4:07:50] <watts121> Feels like Pat's been playing through Control for years.
[4:07:50] <+Dre_> its just the bright fall awe after this
[4:07:51] <%RyTYoung> more like 80%
[4:07:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> At the end of the Alan Wake game DLC you fight Barry as a shadow
[4:07:55] <heartlesshealer> short, but full
[4:07:59] <%za7az> Yay, Bastion! :)
[4:08:05] <CatmanIX> 50-90%
[4:08:08] <%bread_assassin> One more encounter after this.
[4:08:12] <heartlesshealer> DLC dense on lore and pretty good
[4:08:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm just happy The Gods of Asgard got a happy ending.
[4:08:21] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> at the rate hes playing id saw halfway but 60 or 70 percent overall
[4:08:31] <+Javaa01> But you can spam dashes a lot
[4:08:33] <RichochetForce> Baby heal
[4:08:48] <ape_hawk> pat, get the batteries
[4:08:48] <heartlesshealer> steal cubes
[4:08:51] <ape_hawk> into the main room
[4:08:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> I'm happy Alan cared for them enough to write them a happy ending
[4:08:57] <+JustToWatch> it's not super long unless you scrape everything superhard
[4:09:05] <heartlesshealer> green cubs bad, yellow cube make
[4:09:05] <mattatatatatatatat> pat do the thing
[4:09:11] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> shoot the hiss nodes boomer

[4:09:42] <RichochetForce> ^
[4:09:50] <heartlesshealer> well yeah?
[4:09:55] <$RealThiele> Jesse needs some Bio-boosted armor
[4:09:56] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> He just now noticed?
[4:09:57] <Calek> I died here too much, tried to rush it
[4:09:59] <PanicSwytch> The juice is loose
[4:10:02] <heartlesshealer> that's what the darkness explicitly drained
[4:10:02] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> BLIND
[4:10:03] <mattatatatatatatat> are you fighting slenderman
[4:10:04] <dinnydanny777> Oh no, zero force energy
[4:10:06] <SaltyAzteca> yeyeyeye StinkyCheese
[4:10:12] <$lotharrio> Not a lot, but more than it would normally heal.
[4:10:12] <Daxalog> Health on evading a move I guess?
[4:10:19] <%DedlokPM> rooD Not the juice!
[4:10:19] <+Punchasaur> kill more
[4:10:21] <%Aleate> Why did it say 50% if thats all it heals? otzHmm
[4:10:25] <Daxalog> Oh nvm
[4:10:33] <%WhereIsWill> is this paige traverses the wooliehole: the game???
[4:10:42] <mattatatatatatatat> serpentine
[4:10:48] <RichochetForce> 50 flat
[4:10:59] <+Grandnatics> You would've died w/o it tho
[4:11:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh that sucks, I thought it said 50%
[4:11:08] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> mine was 10...
[4:11:13] <$RealThiele> HoTs work
[4:11:17] <%tattleworm> heal on doing launch damage to enemies is the best personal mod in the game
[4:11:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nothing Personnel, Kid
[4:11:24] <+Punchasaur> use the boost to get through
[4:11:27] <heartlesshealer> he teleported behind you geez
[4:11:31] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Darkness = bad pat...
[4:11:50] <heartlesshealer> the final cube...
[4:12:00] <+Punchasaur> yeah he moves real fast if you're not under a light
[4:12:06] <mattatatatatatatat> hes doing it
[4:12:10] <+VultsTV> wow the new tomb raider looks wild
[4:12:11] <upsidedown01> Can these guys be hijacked
[4:12:17] <heartlesshealer> no touch
[4:12:24] <clockworknait1> can anyone please tell me where the arcade was again? I've lost it
[4:12:28] <ExpressNode> Orb vs cubes, who will win...
[4:12:45] <heartlesshealer> ran away
[4:12:51] <RichochetForce> FFffff
[4:12:53] <Calek> The Third Thing looks so cool
[4:12:55] <$RealThiele> Jormungandr just wants to be buddies
[4:12:55] <chambatron> That booty tho
[4:12:58] <dinnydanny777> Why did the camera pan to his ass
[4:13:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, is he INTENTIONALLY setting up each arena so he always has an escape path or is this actually just random and he's super lucky?
[4:13:02] <%Deekman> why'd you keep running through doors instead of blasting through glass?
[4:13:16] <heartlesshealer> those kimimaro bones
[4:13:18] <%Ipsenscastle> are those his ribs on the wrong side of his spine?
[4:13:20] <+Javaa01> The glass there is reinforced
[4:13:27] <+Kurt_0> Having a good time ?
[4:13:41] <Reizie_Etherealm> Also why does he keep running to these areas with lots of lights that are already off for some reason
[4:13:47] <+VultsTV> found the chicken
[4:13:50] <+yourspecialfriend562> Hi pat
[4:13:56] <heartlesshealer> light
[4:14:02] <heartlesshealer> flashlight at entrance
[4:14:04] <Daxalog> What are the MATS for?
[4:14:05] <TundraOW> Isn't there a flashlight upgrade?
[4:14:08] <%Razputin217> sirlioForreal
[4:14:09] <+Javaa01> There's another box down here
[4:14:09] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> BLIND
[4:14:14] <+yourspecialfriend562> Hello everyone else
[4:14:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> The FBC seems shocking lacking in illumination devices.
[4:14:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like a flashlight
[4:14:54] <heartlesshealer> looks like you got it all
[4:14:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Or are handheld flashlights a 'banned' item, like the #2 pencil?
[4:15:01] <heartlesshealer> maybe
[4:15:06] <$RealThiele> that light says meh to power sources
[4:15:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat Planning on doing Zero Dawn now that it got patched?
[4:15:14] <+Javaa01> Yeah, they hint at this place existing via seeing it on the elevator
[4:15:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the oldest house hates anything modern so probably\
[4:15:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RealThiele Batteries
[4:15:27] <+Delenay> i still dont trust it lol
[4:15:28] <+Javaa01> Still not patched enough
[4:15:36] <+Delenay> ill wait unil they stop patching
[4:15:37] <%walternatorz> It's now Horizon one dawn.
[4:15:39] <BallerSwagBro9k> Works fine for me
[4:15:44] <dinnydanny777> I saw people saying they didn't patch all the issues
[4:15:47] <$RealThiele> those are some dope-ass duracells
[4:15:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck Flashlights are literally some of the oldest tech in existence, definitely older than the tape deck players they use.
[4:15:51] <+JustToWatch> I heard it works fine
[4:15:52] <+Javaa01> It's getting there, but give it a few weeks
[4:15:57] <BallerSwagBro9k> oh

[4:18:33] <+JustToWatch> there is
[4:18:35] <Djinnazz> there is
[4:18:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> Wasteland 2 was ass
[4:18:36] <%astrophizz> fallout is a wasteland spin-off, basically
[4:18:37] <+yourspecialfriend562> It’s ok
[4:18:39] <%tattleworm> grip mod was in the base game
[4:18:40] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Kinda
[4:18:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> its post apocalyptic Xcom, but I feel like you wouldn't dig it.
[4:18:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wait for it
[4:18:44] <RichochetForce> Yes
[4:18:44] <+Javaa01> Grip's fancy mod is in the base game
[4:18:44] <Djinnazz> YES THERE IS YOU IDIOTS
[4:18:45] <%Deekman> yes, oh wait i mean no, no no no
[4:18:46] <%akaAxi0m> I usually despise those types of games and Wasteland 3 looks like a blast
[4:18:48] <bahble> Why is Crusader King 3 so highly rated, god DAMN
[4:18:49] <%bread_assassin> I love Wasteland 3, and I dropped Wasteland 2 in the first area.]
[4:18:50] <clockworknait1> Grounded got an awesome patch
[4:18:50] <ape_hawk> W2 has chris avellone smudge on it, dont play it
[4:18:50] <RichochetForce> Grip's ultimate is in vanillla
[4:18:54] <%DedlokPM> Wasteland 3 is Fallout 1 & 2, but with xcom cover systen
[4:18:55] <Daxalog> Wasteland 2 was given away by GOG for free
[4:18:58] <Calek> was the infinite ammo the fancy grip mod
[4:19:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bahble Bots.
[4:19:09] <%tattleworm> infinite ammo on hit
[4:19:12] <Djinnazz> Unnlinited ammo as long as you hit something
[4:19:12] <$lotharrio> It gives 100% ammo refund on shots that hit.
[4:19:15] <RichochetForce> Grip infinite ammo
[4:19:16] <+Javaa01> No ammo expenditure on hits
[4:19:16] <+JustToWatch> every succesful hit reloads a round, best mod in the game
[4:19:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> wasteland 3 is free on Xbox Game Pass for PC
[4:19:32] <$lotharrio> You gotta burn a bunch of tvs in maintenance.
[4:19:33] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @doc_ock_rokc Devil Trigger > Dark Disquiet > Control
[4:19:35] <+JustToWatch> throw tvs into the furnace
[4:19:36] <RichochetForce> Yeah, Grip becomes best weapon in the game with that
[4:19:38] <%tattleworm> gotta find tvs and throw them in the incinerator, you will need a guide to track them down
[4:19:41] <+Javaa01> You'd be too lazy to get it, it's kind of a process
[4:19:44] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt gotta fight tv's with flames on them and throw them in the furnace
[4:19:55] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt In maintance, you have to throw like 6 tv scattered thoughout the floor in the incinerator.
[4:19:55] <RichochetForce> Yes, Feed the Furnace lol
[4:20:01] <Calek> they're high up
[4:20:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> "To unlock the ‘Eternal Fire‘ Weapon Mod, which gives you 100% ammo refund on hit for your Grip — essentially giving you infinite ammo as long as you land every shot — you’ll need to complete a strange Easter egg quest in the Maintenance Sector. In the Furnace Chamber, you need to throw six unique TVs into the flames. The TVs have pictures of fire on them, and spew smoke — burning all six will give you the Eternal Fire weapon mod."
[4:20:04] <$lotharrio> Cause Northmoor is inside the furnace.
[4:20:06] <mattatatatatatatat> pats a simp who has to reload his gun
[4:20:09] <upsidedown01> It's darkness, Pat, nobody can see it
[4:20:18] <$RealThiele> The Molded lack the intelligence to interact with tools and contraptions, including basic functions such as opening doors
[4:20:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TIME_PUNCHER And Crimson Cloud is above all?
[4:20:40] <%Aleate> It was Umbra psaDogchamp
[4:20:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chaos Insurgency?!
[4:20:55] <Calek> I love that this game is setting up a new villain
[4:21:01] <+Javaa01> @lotharrio Nope, the furnace is it's own thing
[4:21:01] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat Have you tried casting magic missile against the darkness tho
[4:21:03] <Calek> or the dlc is rather
[4:21:08] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> oh yeah its one of the best grip mods and its in the blast furance
[4:21:17] <KnightAsteran> this Blessing group feels like setup for the sequel
[4:21:18] <RichochetForce> Paranatural criminal terrorists, wow
[4:21:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Calek maybe this is the next remedy game?
[4:21:33] <RichochetForce> @KnightAsteran That and The Former
[4:21:35] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> inside you
[4:21:38] <Louie_Salmon> Behind the Door to Darkness
[4:21:38] <ape_hawk> upper floor, on the catwalks

[4:22:18] <%TIME_PUNCHER> you a good job, pat
[4:22:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Words are hard - Pat 20XX
[4:22:20] <Calek> @doc_ock_rokc Remedy has said two games are in development in the Control universe
[4:22:23] <Robot_Nixon_> distGa
[4:22:25] <LordOfThePoultry> words hard :)
[4:22:29] <penitentpentwitch> Rubbing that light on the darkness, mocking it
[4:22:34] <+yourspecialfriend562> Words
[4:22:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Calek lets hope they don't sell out again
[4:22:48] <%VultsTV> VultsTV subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:22:51] <RichochetForce> Licking the darkness with a tongue made of light, lol
[4:22:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> ORB
[4:22:53] <mattatatatatatatat> yay for pat
[4:22:56] <$lotharrio> I really hope that when a Control 2 comes out, it's not obviously Control 2.
[4:22:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not not ORB
[4:23:03] <+JustToWatch> 3 ia between 2 wall columns on the right
[4:23:06] <ape_hawk> one is above one of the mobile labs
[4:23:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its in your soul pat
[4:23:11] <Skeledan> wouldnt it just be easier to hold the light
[4:23:15] <RichochetForce> The darkness resides in the heart of all worlds.
[4:23:16] <%king_wragles> Why is Control Kingdom Hearts right now? Why is Pat fighting Darkness?
[4:23:17] <+Javaa01> There are construction lights placed near the darkness blobs
[4:23:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's in your heart, Riku
[4:23:22] <Calek> @doc_ock_rokc if it means they can make whatever they want with no creative influence from publisher, they can do whatever they want imo
[4:23:22] <dinnydanny777> Am I the darkness?
[4:23:27] <iswearimjustdandy> @lotharrio itll be called OOPS: The Game
[4:23:30] <mattatatatatatatat> time to play the game

[4:23:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @king_wragles You answered your second question with your first.
[4:23:39] <dinnydanny777> Was the darkness the friends we made along the way?
[4:23:50] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> one of trhe best mods

[4:28:40] <%FutaSnek> Tfw she roasts your orbs FeelsBadMan
[4:28:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> Apparently the Mandalorian S2 is having MAJOR problems before its October release
[4:29:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Alan has it rough
[4:29:13] <+pkmamsters> This Wake guy looks like he's good with a flashlight
[4:29:14] <Calek> Alan BibleThump
[4:29:23] <%FutaSnek> I REALLY hope they put the Poet and the Muse in this DLC that song is THE BEST
[4:29:24] <%charp35> why is he typing with only two fingers
[4:29:48] <%Skittlesoul> to be more dramatice
[4:29:50] <SaltyAzteca> Take Control Alan
[4:29:52] <+Punchasaur> its homeless edgy darling
[4:29:53] <+pkmamsters> that's how you type on a typewriter
[4:29:58] <+yourspecialfriend562> Boomer typing
[4:30:04] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> with a typewriter i bet its easier
[4:30:06] <iswearimjustdandy> @charp35 thats how typewriters worked
[4:30:11] <%BinaryFireball> why is this man typing on a typewriter?
[4:30:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Alan is literally talking about how to write a good mystery.
[4:30:14] <ToneBacas> he's talking about writing
[4:30:15] <%FutaSnek> Old typewriters are actually pretty hard to use all your fingers on without getting the keys stuck up
[4:30:17] <+CourageTheCat> typewriters don't work as well with regular keyboard typing
[4:30:19] <%Deekman> guy has ben writing for 10 years only using 2 fingers and has to look at his keyboard
[4:30:25] <%king_wragles> @charp35 so on real typewriters you can actually type TOO fast and end up destroying it from the inside out!
[4:30:27] <%RyTYoung> He's talking about the first manuscript he wrote
[4:30:29] <+CourageTheCat> yeah the keys are also harder to push
[4:30:31] <iswearimjustdandy> @binaryfireball its an object of power
[4:30:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Of course Pat is flummoxed by a writer talking about writing.
[4:30:35] <%MelBrooksKA> I don't think GRRM is takking author jail very well...
[4:30:39] <%reonome> reminder than GRRM also types with two fingers
[4:30:44] <%BinaryFireball> @iswearimjustdandy is the winner
[4:30:45] <+bromeme> Is this the same Alan Wake of Alan Wake fame?
[4:30:47] <NeroInfinite> I mean it's a type writernot a keyboard you fools
[4:30:50] <%Skittlesoul> @BinaryFireball he is a hipster author
[4:30:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bromeme Yes
[4:31:07] <+pkmamsters> old people were too dumb enough to learn how type good on future key board
[4:31:13] <+pkmamsters> shoulda time travelled, nerds
[4:31:14] <%BinaryFireball> nope I am now convinced it is an altered item of immense power
[4:31:16] <%FutaSnek> GRRM Types by waiting for calcium deposits to form and drip pages onto the script LUL LUL
[4:31:21] <%RyTYoung> Och aye
[4:31:21] <%king_wragles> Why are you Irish now?
[4:31:22] <%BinaryFireball> a symobl of his might
[4:31:27] <SaltyAzteca> Oh he's using the new gun?
[4:31:27] <chaumiester> Do you ever get different guns in the game?
[4:31:29] <+bromeme> Is this the first ever non fighting game crossover?
[4:31:30] <%king_wragles> Fair

[4:31:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bromeme What actually was that sentence.
[4:31:52] <+Javaa01> It's the ginger in him, it's making him speak in tongues
[4:31:54] <Calek> @chaumiester yeah you get a few, they're no individual guns just different forms of the same one
[4:31:54] <%suikudo> his name is pat

[4:33:27] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt So, Hartman worked here.
[4:33:29] <+KingpinLarry> I wish I had a chance to play Alan Wake before playing this DLC. It felt like I was missing out on something.
[4:33:37] <+pkmamsters> Hartman sounds like he's acting like he's acting
[4:33:38] <%BinaryFireball> Did Hartman create BTs?
[4:33:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Djinnazz Or he tried to, anyway.
[4:33:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> I WAS HOLDING THEM BACK
[4:33:45] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> "I HAVE RIGHTS" says the man who fucked over dozens of people
[4:33:45] <Calek> Hartman didn't work here, they had him detained
[4:33:49] <@SoFarFetched> "BUT AMERIKUH"

[4:35:28] <heartlesshealer> yeah, event doors
[4:35:29] <+yourspecialfriend562> Magic
[4:35:30] <+pkmamsters> sounds like an understatement, Jesse
[4:35:32] <Calek> did Pat find the note about Alex Casey?
[4:35:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KingpinLarry oh did you try it yet
[4:35:42] <%RyTYoung> Like portals to them or some shit
[4:35:56] <%reonome> monkaS
[4:35:58] <+Delenay> i dont think so?
[4:36:01] <Huntercd> Is Pat naked?
[4:36:04] <heartlesshealer> don't like that
[4:36:17] <%FutaSnek> DARKNESS
[4:36:23] <%FutaSnek> IMPRISONING ME
[4:36:23] <heartlesshealer> pat had to order pants online
[4:36:26] <ToneBacas> rude. the darkness was sleeping
[4:36:27] <%Ipsenscastle> this is no good
[4:36:32] <%reonome> alan wake IS LIGHT
[4:36:33] <Reizie_Etherealm> That can't be! Not even the hiss can reach into this place
[4:36:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Huntercd down to his skeleton
[4:36:41] <rosemon5001> do be honest they should join the darkness they got cookies The board wants you to be their puppet
[4:36:51] <+KingpinLarry> @doc_ock_rokc Not yet. I started Oddworld Stranger's Wrath, which has been sitting in my Steam Library for 2 years. I have so much backlog
[4:37:00] <+dmtjinni> x
[4:37:03] <+Delenay> it might be coming into the hotel through the rooms
[4:37:18] <ToneBacas> @KingpinLarry having fun with Stranger's Wrath?
[4:37:40] <+yourspecialfriend562> What is the black stuff
[4:37:48] <Huntercd> Why is he speaking in the third person?
[4:37:49] <PanicSwytch> He's speaking in 3rd person?
[4:37:54] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the dark presence
[4:37:55] <heartlesshealer> Alan put his wife in the Control world to make everything real so he could be saved????
[4:37:58] <SaltyAzteca> It became a river
[4:37:58] <Djinnazz> Or Genious
[4:37:59] <ape_hawk> Alan isnt the smartest man, pat
[4:38:04] <+pkmamsters> this lighting is called non-coincidence of tone
[4:38:05] <Calek> he's writing in 3rd person
[4:38:09] <%RyTYoung> yeah just write and the darkness was gonna the end LUL
[4:38:13] <+yourspecialfriend562> It’s been years since I’ve played Allin wake
[4:38:14] <%Ipsenscastle> a river, a flood, then an ocean - you know, like Pat's house. With PISSSSSs
[4:38:15] <clockworknait1> The boss rush mode is pretty fun to and gives good mods
[4:38:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wake has been having a rough... decade.
[4:38:24] <%FutaSnek> So you think this story was in the works back when they made Alan Wake?
[4:38:35] <ape_hawk> Jesse is Alan's hero, aww
[4:38:36] <%reonome> "and then they banged, the end"
[4:38:46] <LordOfThePoultry> uhh
[4:38:47] <%king_wragles> SQUEEK SQUEEK
[4:38:47] <%Zalthia> ummm
[4:38:48] <%kewlmyc> LUL that fucking toy
[4:38:48] <%FutaSnek> OH FUCK
[4:38:50] <+CourageTheCat> bruh holy shit
[4:38:51] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I think alan wake described this alan literally cannot write a "happy ending" out of the blue. it has to be believable
[4:38:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> SQUEAK
[4:38:53] <NeroInfinite> translated Honk honk trnaslated LUL
[4:38:54] <ape_hawk> pat, he invented EVERYTHING
[4:39:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:39:01] <%Deekman> he created everything
[4:39:03] <%RyTYoung> Yup...
[4:39:05] <clockworknait1> wake invented the world as they know it! He invented kegals!
[4:39:08] <%mythcreant> i didn't know i needed this until now
[4:39:13] <%tattleworm> you are a worm through time
[4:39:13] <Calek> @FutaSnek the FBC was mentioned in a comic that came with the Alan Wake special edition
[4:39:16] <heartlesshealer> he created the hiss to make Jesse a hero so Alan could be saved by her????
[4:39:18] <%reonome> yes
[4:39:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Control is a STORY
[4:39:19] <+Javaa01> After 2010
[4:39:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wibly Wobly
[4:39:20] <ape_hawk> YUUUUUP
[4:39:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Timey Wimey
[4:39:21] <LordOfThePoultry> goddamnit wake
[4:39:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> ...pat I think youre super wrong
[4:39:24] <penitentpentwitch> So attack and dethrone... Alan Wake?
[4:39:27] <%Deekman> @PatStaresAt Alan's manuscript appeared under the door
[4:39:28] <ToneBacas> the retcons
[4:39:29] <ape_hawk> its a powerful typewriter, dude
[4:39:30] <Clowns> Wake Retconned Reality :O
[4:39:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT ABOUT THE BOARD?
[4:39:33] <Calek> @PatStaresAt it existed in the 70's, Alan didn't create the FBC just nudged it in place
[4:39:36] <+pkmamsters> Wake invented Jesse and then gave her a cool coat!
[4:39:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> So Wake has become an actual god now?
[4:39:37] <devanmuse> Alan wake isn't part of the control universe... it's the other way around
[4:39:38] <NeonBleu> Wake to strong nerf pls
[4:39:38] <%FutaSnek> @Calek Good shit I love a plan in the making
[4:39:41] <%Deekman> @PatStaresAt that's what i was talking about earlier lol
[4:39:45] <+JustToWatch> there's no mention of Wake writing about Ahti, the oldest house, or the board though
[4:39:46] <mattatatatatatatat> wait its all wakes fan fiction
[4:39:47] <%Garthunox> is every remedy game just an Alan wake story?
[4:39:57] <+yourspecialfriend562> Allin wake is god ?
[4:40:01] <clockworknait1> Alan wake invented chunneling
[4:40:03] <%FutaSnek> Wait it was all Alan Wake?
[4:40:06] <HeroToxiko> LUL so wake just wrote the game
[4:40:06] <HorribleHog> oh so it's from beyond
[4:40:07] <+KingpinLarry> @doc_ock_rokc I've been enjoying it. Controller setup was a nightmare though. Went through an hour of trail and error then 4 different users options before I found the right one.
[4:40:09] <%RyTYoung> Yeah I dunno if that's a full proof theory...he may have created the his but not the FBC
[4:40:09] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Wake is literally a reality wraper but he has limits
[4:40:12] <%tattleworm> owned idiots, you funded the series that got canned
[4:40:12] <%Deekman> @yourspecialfriend562 yes
[4:40:15] <%RyTYoung> hiss
[4:40:16] <%FutaSnek> *Cocks Gun* Always has been
[4:40:16] <%reonome> always has been
[4:40:21] <+pkmamsters> Alan Wake invented butt chugging
[4:40:24] <%walternatorz> surprise this is a Tide commercial
[4:40:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Did you play alan wake? Wake isn't the first one
[4:40:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, I think what Alan is saying in that clip is that it works best if he uses pre-existing connections instead of creating things out of the blue, so the FBC existed, he just used it for his own story.
[4:40:34] <clockworknait1> I honestly don't even think Alan wake is real, he is just a character created by Thomas Zane
[4:40:40] <+CourageTheCat> I think he created the hiss but not the beaureau
[4:40:42] <+CourageTheCat> bureau??
[4:40:46] <HorribleHog> no wait not from beyond, in the mouth of madness
[4:40:47] <ToneBacas> i'm very ok with this way of extending the Alan Wake universe. More games should do this
[4:40:56] <HeroToxiko> @FutaSnek Always was
[4:40:57] <%RyTYoung> @doc_ock_rokc Do you mean the max Payne games...?
[4:41:04] <%FutaSnek> MORE GAMES NEED CONNECTED LORE
[4:41:06] <%FutaSnek> ITS DOPE
[4:41:13] <Calek> @clockworknait1 there's a bit of a chicken and egg situation with those two
[4:41:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> Fanfic writers are wondering how they can obtain Wake's power to alter reality as we speak
[4:41:17] <%Deekman> final boss time
[4:41:18] <+JustToWatch> check your multimedia
[4:41:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RyTYoung not exactly
[4:41:30] <%afronooch> H E A R T M A N
[4:41:36] <%RyTYoung> @doc_ock_rokc Alex Casey? I think that's his name
[4:41:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Reizie_Etherealm It's easy, just trap yourself in a living hell.
[4:41:42] <%tattleworm> it's interesting that only quantum break doesn't get referenced at any point, i guess that's a licensing thing
[4:41:44] <tolloponik> Heart man so this is where he goes when he dies
[4:41:45] <%Ipsenscastle> MR SCRATCH
[4:41:47] <Calek> FRANK BREAKER YEAH
[4:41:53] <clockworknait1> @calek But didn't Zane create the story of wake to stop his wife that was the darkness?
[4:42:01] <SaltyAzteca> The end of AW1
[4:42:01] <%FutaSnek> @Reizie_Etherealm Oh god the thought of a sonic fanfic writer given omnipotence is horrid
[4:42:03] <%Zalthia> Alan. Made the hiss? Made Jesse?
[4:42:11] <%Deekman> His daughter was the sheriff in Alan Wake
[4:42:16] <Huntercd> If chris had these powers the bloodline would be saved
[4:42:19] <%Dwarven_Gaming> HER dad was a beureu member!
[4:42:20] <+yourspecialfriend562> Is the hiss and the darkness the same them just some writers horror thing
[4:42:21] <HorribleHog> tattleworm Maybe they just want to bury quantum break deep LUL
[4:42:21] <dinnydanny777> @futasnek Coldsteel becomes real?
[4:42:21] <%FutaSnek> Alan made everything
[4:42:27] <%Aleate> LUL Squeaky Squeak
[4:42:34] <%BubbaRands> psaDogchamp SQUEEK
[4:42:34] <+yourspecialfriend562> Thing*
[4:42:36] <%Beough> @PatStaresAt do you think this makes Alan sorta villainous in a way, because he created this horrific alien threat just so he could get out, or not?
[4:42:46] <%tattleworm> quantum break was neat at the end, it wasn't all bad
[4:42:54] <ape_hawk> he needed to power jesse up
[4:42:56] <%tattleworm> just mostly
[4:42:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's been trying to a decade with no success Pat, give the boy a break.
[4:42:59] <%Deekman> he had to write it in such a way that the darkness couldn't outsmart him
[4:43:00] <Calek> @clockworknait1 Alan wrote about getting to a page written by Zane that was written about Alan getting to the lake 7 years before Alan was even born
[4:43:05] <%RyTYoung> yeyeyeye
[4:43:06] <%FutaSnek> @dinnydanny777 The paiiiiinnnnn
[4:43:16] <%PhysicsLB> AWE = Alan Wake Event?
[4:43:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> Let loose on that goose!
[4:43:21] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I dont think alan created the hiss pat...
[4:43:23] <clockworknait1> wasn't the darkness itself created as an enemy by Alan wake while zanes "wife made him write the story?
[4:43:25] <%miguelrod777> THICC
[4:43:26] <+Punchasaur> shut
[4:43:28] <chambatron> Is this the end?
[4:43:28] <+JustToWatch> Alan specifically mentions using connections to make the story realm so he he didn't make EVERYTHING
[4:43:29] <%mythcreant> leg
[4:43:30] <%PhysicsLB> no idea what is going on
[4:43:31] <%Beough> and also do you think Alan created EVERYTHING like Jesse and the Bureau, etc. or do you think those pieces were already there and he just put the pieces into place
[4:43:33] <%mythcreant> legg
[4:43:38] <%Aleate> That thing is pretty rad ngl
[4:43:38] <%Zalthia> I wonder if hes just. Psychic? Like hes not writing them into existance, hes writing about them
[4:43:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> See, people think time is a linear series of cause and effect, but it's actually like a ball of wibbly wobbly, timey whimey, stuff.
[4:43:40] <+Fnir> Sass
[4:43:43] <Calek> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck he created their voice, the dark place made them evil

[4:44:19] <SaltyAzteca> ROUND 2 BAYBEEE
[4:44:23] <%Beough> @JustToWatch okay that's what i was hoping, cause i think the other way around is like kinda disappointing
[4:44:23] <+yourspecialfriend562> Is Allin Aware of his powers completely
[4:44:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @Calek i dont think thats right
[4:44:31] <clockworknait1> this is the fight I got softlocked on, Hartman wouldn't move/die at all
[4:44:34] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @Calek or the implication
[4:44:36] <mattatatatatatatat> hartmans heart shaped booty
[4:44:39] <+KingpinLarry> The bullshit rounds
[4:44:49] <%FutaSnek> THIS SEEMS LIKE A ROUGH THING TO TURN INTIO
[4:45:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DianaTheAscian I think he invented the Hiss, and coerced the prior Director to letting them loose, but we haven't see him writing about Jessie (YET), so she might have been an unknown variable.
[4:45:04] <%BubbaRands> When Hartman drops it low Kreygasm

[4:46:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DianaTheAscian Trying to confirm anything concrete in a Remedy game is next to impossible though.
[4:46:29] <+Punchasaur> when i fought him he didn't darken the room more than once
[4:46:31] <ape_hawk> pat missed the radio to call in backup for this fight...

[4:46:37] <%Puhff> LUL JUKED EM
[4:46:46] <SleepyMaribo> @Djinnazz i have that gun and i never seen it do that, i thought it could only fire when fully charged
[4:46:53] <DianaTheAscian> Is Pats AC broken again or did he not feel like begin on camera?
[4:46:54] <Calek> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck in Alan Wake it's stated that Alan has to be careful of what he writes because the dark place twists it to it's own evil end, by creating the hiss through his random dadaist poem the dark place took the idea of the hiss to an extreme logical conclusion
[4:46:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SleepyMaribo It's a mod
[4:47:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DianaTheAscian The house is covered in piss
[4:47:05] <DianaTheAscian> @CommanderSqueaks true
[4:47:08] <clockworknait1> They literally went back on him being a poet to him being a TV producer or some shit
[4:47:13] <%FutaSnek> Man this is a great monster design
[4:47:15] <%Afterman_> die hartman
[4:47:15] <Calek> at least that's my theory, it's better than saying Alan is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of FBC employees
[4:47:16] <Djinnazz> @SleepyMaribo he got a mod that charges it instantly
[4:47:23] <iswearimjustdandy> @dianatheascian dog problems
[4:47:25] <%FutaSnek> Not too weird but moves weird enough to be creepy
[4:47:34] <%Afterman_> is pat ac still broken?
[4:47:37] <DianaTheAscian> @CommanderSqueaks damn
[4:47:40] <iswearimjustdandy> I forgot how much the visual enemy designs rule in this game
[4:47:58] <%Afterman_> yo this dude design
[4:47:59] <clockworknait1> I think he could've been a great silent hill enemy
[4:48:02] <SaltyAzteca> Command grabs PogChamp
[4:48:12] <%FutaSnek> His design reminds me of a Left4 Dead enemy kinda
[4:48:13] <%BubbaRands> nice juke PogChamp
[4:48:18] <Tomschiii> the game doesnt have many enemies tbh^^
[4:48:21] <%Afterman_> hartman was strecthed PogChamp
[4:48:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Calek But the darkness also exists as its own entity, so I think Wake has grown to the point where he's able to write around the Darkness, but as a result can end up creating whole new problems (like the Hiss).
[4:48:28] <SaltyAzteca> Because he was stretched
[4:48:31] <+codydudetm> Should I have any prior knowledge of Alan Wake? Cause all these references are flyin' over my head
[4:48:35] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @Calek yeah i had to reremember some things from alan wake and control. I personally think the hiss are their own entity but alan might have made them to what they are in the game
[4:48:53] <ape_hawk> good job
[4:48:56] <+yourspecialfriend562> Throw shit at him too

[4:50:58] <heartlesshealer> so check out the room
[4:50:59] <%BubbaRands> You did it! you did it...
[4:51:01] <%Deekman> right. I wish they would've textured the fucking house
[4:51:01] <+Punchasaur> control is the longest teaser trailer in history
[4:51:02] <ExpressNode> Alan Broke
[4:51:03] <dinnydanny777> GivePLZ lore
[4:51:09] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Basically alan wants jesse to save him
[4:51:17] <+Javaa01> They're near the cubicles
[4:51:17] <heartlesshealer> don't forget to shelf scrape too
[4:51:22] <%Aleate> >:(
[4:51:23] <%DedlokPM> woolieMIRIN Hall Wugging
[4:51:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> He seems like he's having a good time.
[4:51:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> If the darkness can spread into the motel then that's a problem
[4:51:26] <%FutaSnek> WOW ALAN
[4:51:28] <ape_hawk> control is also a damn good teaser trailer
[4:51:29] <%FutaSnek> NOT LOOKING GREAT
[4:51:31] <dinnydanny777> He looks very sane
[4:51:35] <%RyTYoung> yeah his wife was getting haunted and shit
[4:51:36] <Tomschiii> fcking great photo^^
[4:51:37] <+Punchasaur> Alan Woke
[4:51:40] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Mr Scratch?
[4:51:44] <Calek> that's Mr Scratch!
[4:51:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh that's Mr. Scratch
[4:51:46] <+ianabstract> Havin a normal one
[4:51:47] <clockworknait1> his wife took that dic pic in the dark
[4:51:48] <Calek> maybe
[4:51:49] <Reizie_Etherealm> He looks like that guy from RE7
[4:51:52] <dinnydanny777> You ever just angrily scream into a camera?
[4:51:54] <JPstudmuffin> Probably a Scratch photo??
[4:51:55] <%tattleworm> he haunted his wife to force her to visit the fbc, very cool
[4:51:59] <%Deekman> ghost dick pics
[4:52:03] <+KingpinLarry> After I beat Hartman 3 enemies spawned in the room. WTF?
[4:52:12] <%Faustgesicht> Faustgesicht subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! howdy pat. Keep on keepin' on
[4:52:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> And everyone here who has never played Alan Wake going "WHO THE FUCK IS MR. SCRATCH!?"
[4:52:20] <%Deekman> fuck yeah
[4:52:22] <%FutaSnek> OF COURSE THEY WHERE
[4:52:29] <+Delenay> what if the next games awe uses a camera to catch images of the shadow
[4:52:30] <%FutaSnek> IS THE BAND A OOP
[4:52:30] <clockworknait1> gick picks lol
[4:52:40] <%RyTYoung> I want this to be a co-op mode in the sequel!
[4:52:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> Wasn't Mr. Scratch created by Thomas Zane?
[4:52:47] <Calek> Tor has a daughter oh my
[4:52:48] <ape_hawk> mr scratch is the patches of alan wake
[4:52:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> So is the next game going to be literally impenetrable if you haven't played Control and Alan Wake?
[4:52:59] <clockworknait1> fatal frame : Dicks in the darkness
[4:53:04] <SaltyAzteca> Metal.
[4:53:08] <JPstudmuffin> So if it's taken literally; Alan Wake 2 in 2022! hype! lol
[4:53:09] <Huntercd> Metal
[4:53:17] <+KingpinLarry> There they are!
[4:53:17] <%Dwarven_Gaming> dude, most badass old men ever
[4:53:21] <Calek> @Reizie_Etherealm no he just mentioned that a version of Alan Wake (but not actually) would be replacing him
[4:53:26] <%코코꾸라> @CommanderSqueaks Remedy already said they're making the RGU, Remedy Gaming Universe
[4:53:27] <%FutaSnek> Im not joking I think the band is a OOP cause they have a song in alan wake that moves the plot along LUL
[4:53:28] <%코코꾸라> So yeah
[4:53:29] <KnightAsteran> they beat Mr Scratch?
[4:53:34] <chhdez> More like Alan Wake 3ish
[4:53:37] <heartlesshealer> gotta shelf scrape the center
[4:53:46] <+Javaa01> Check under the elevator
[4:53:52] <%Faustgesicht> Alan Wake 2 features Icelandic death metal. Neat
[4:53:53] <%tattleworm> @PatStaresAt i think there might be one under the elevator
[4:54:01] <%Ipsenscastle> what was the deal with Alan Wake's American Nightmare?
[4:54:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> As a Kojima and Kingdom Hearts fan, I can't wait until people pick up the next game and get all butt hurt that they don't understand what's going on.
[4:54:03] <iswearimjustdandy> ...how do we tell Pat that Lore is dead...
[4:54:03] <clockworknait1> So there's really no more expansions for control? I thought awe would do more .
[4:54:07] <%Ipsenscastle> do we just forget that?
[4:54:16] <heartlesshealer> pg 4
[4:54:17] <chhdez> Alan Wake 2: Crazy Talk
[4:54:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Ipsenscastle It was a fake out.
[4:54:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> @Calek But he didn't mention where scratch came from or how he's gonna intereact with others in the real world? That's a bit of an oversight
[4:54:44] <%FutaSnek> @Faustgesicht Old Gods did music in Alan 1 too
[4:54:53] <clockworknait1> @ipsenscastle American nightmare started out as Alan wake 2 but got reworked into a smaller what if game
[4:55:01] <heartlesshealer> end of night springs is the start of Control
[4:55:02] <%Deekman> Childrens Puppet Show
[4:55:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, it ends BEFORE Jesse showed up.
[4:55:02] <%Beough> so pretty much that's trench's death right?
[4:55:11] <ape_hawk> yeah
[4:55:15] <Djinnazz> yeah
[4:55:15] <Calek> @Reizie_Etherealm Zane wasn't in control, Mr Scratch is an agent of The Dark Place, like the big villain of Alan Wake is but in the guise of Alan
[4:55:22] <%tattleworm> sam lake does good work
[4:55:25] <%Faustgesicht> @FutaSnek fuckin' sweet
[4:55:26] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[4:55:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> But the screenplay ends BEFORE Jesse shows up, so she's an unknown variable. I don't think Alan Wake wrote her.
[4:55:32] <clockworknait1> he's not even gonna try the ar are again??
[4:55:33] <rosemon5001> didnt want to talk to pope?
[4:55:33] <heartlesshealer> perfect
[4:55:35] <dinnydanny777> The puppet show creeps the shit out of me
[4:55:40] <%Emperor_Machinus> elgelato
[4:55:47] <asddsa28> yeah
[4:55:53] <clockworknait1> pat gives up on: control lol
[4:55:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ah.
[4:55:58] <dinnydanny777> Night Springs is the live action Alan Wake one and not the puppet show from this one right?
[4:55:58] <heartlesshealer> she's not unknown, she's the hero he was trying to write up with the Hiss crisis
[4:56:03] <%FutaSnek> @Faustgesicht There's actually a part of the game where you have to listen to a song called the poet and the muse to get along in the plot
[4:56:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I like that.
[4:56:05] <+Javaa01> The Quantum Break episode is stuck in the Microsoft vault
[4:56:07] <%FutaSnek> YES
[4:56:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't like that.
[4:56:10] <%Aleate> otzMAD
[4:56:10] <%FutaSnek> ABSOLUTE MOOD
[4:56:11] <ToneBacas> LUL

[4:57:50] <heartlesshealer> if it's a silk -blend- then maybe
[4:57:52] <%afronooch> silk clings, right?
[4:57:53] <%FutaSnek> Like hiding a elephant in a cat carrier LUL
[4:58:00] <+yourspecialfriend562> Bring home the bacon
[4:58:00] <SaltyAzteca> DansGame
[4:58:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god, this cyst lore.
[4:58:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> your silky pj's will reveal the ballsk
[4:58:03] <HorribleHog> nice ascyst
[4:58:11] <Reizie_Etherealm> Psychological horror mystery stories like Alan Wake is like a big fat blunt, you hit it and you get high, you start seeing things and then you stop seeing them until the next blunt
[4:58:26] <clockworknait1> Paige is probably popping wood right now so he's gotta go
[4:58:41] <%Deekman> Deekman subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 16 months! Just in time for Alan Wake!

[4:58:55] <HeroToxiko> EVERY RIDGE
[4:58:57] <+KingpinLarry> See ya later Pat.
[4:59:05] <Psyramics> SMN is boring until later levels too
[4:59:11] <heartlesshealer> They'll eat any vegetables!
[4:59:15] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[4:59:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> I would also recommend Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina for that SCP itch
[4:59:21] <heartlesshealer> No green onions in the house!
[4:59:23] <WyvernsArentDragons> LUL
[4:59:24] <dinnydanny777> Cats like cucumbers
[4:59:24] <iswearimjustdandy> We HAD The People of Earth
[4:59:26] <clockworknait1> One time one of them popped up inside after and it was scary lol
[4:59:27] <%weissguard> Corgis are precious potatoes.
[4:59:30] <%BubbaRands> mmmmm ripe LUL
[4:59:50] <Calek> Alan Wake can't create dominos, he can just set them up and knock them over
[4:59:53] <%R3Roundabout> Last Thursdayism
[5:00:04] <%Ipsenscastle> why wouldnt his writing time travel, the darkness seems to exist outside of time
[5:00:05] <Reizie_Etherealm> Retcon is way too strong
[5:00:19] <JPstudmuffin> What if Alan is Mr Door? He can basically see everything can't he?
[5:00:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> don't grief zangief
[5:00:30] <dinnydanny777> Is Alan Wake an OoP or is it his typewriter or the whole of Cauldron Lake
[5:00:34] <clockworknait1> Spoilers Alan wake is actually mr scratch and split personalities because he wanted to stop himself because he actually created the darkness
[5:00:39] <%RyTYoung> It's a big difference, the menu loads are shit on ps4
[5:00:44] <%tattleworm> @dinnydanny777 yes
[5:00:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's the typewriter that's an OoP
[5:01:00] <Calek> @JPstudmuffin big theory is that Mr. Hatch from Quantum Break is Mr. Door in this
[5:01:00] <$lotharrio> Simp harder, man! Simp harder!
[5:01:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> the video game Alan Wake is the AWE
[5:01:15] <HeroToxiko> he retconned reality, just revisionist stand powers
[5:01:29] <%BubbaRands> When v-tuber Pat?
[5:01:37] <%tattleworm> blessed showed with the train that you can make an oop so the typewriter could well have been made one by wake
[5:01:39] <+scerpico> Didn't Alan Wake hint that Alan or Zane set up part of Alans childhood to make that Lightswitch thing from the Well-Lit Room work?
[5:02:04] <+meowarco> @dinnydanny777 Alan's typewriter is an OOP it's locked up in this game
[5:02:08] <Djinnazz> Waskinda expecting the Former to show up at some point, darn it.
[5:02:08] <Calek> Zane wrote about Alan and the clicker 7 years before he was born
[5:02:11] <clockworknait1> oh yeah forgot that bit
[5:02:13] <Reizie_Etherealm> If Alan can retcon then we would ask questions like why can he retcon this but not this etc.
[5:02:18] <JPstudmuffin> @calek Definitely caught that. Gud thing about Remedy, that make you speculate.
[5:02:28] <JPstudmuffin> they**
[5:02:44] <clockworknait1> So confirmed Zane created all of this
[5:02:52] <Aydarkzero> did Pat buy a 3090 yet? Kappa
[5:03:00] <%BubbaRands> Blah blah blah goberment blah blah blah 5g
[5:03:04] <JPstudmuffin> God, I hope they remake Alan Wake at some point
[5:03:06] <+meowarco> Zane the poet?
[5:03:13] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[5:03:18] <%weissguard> hehe, SCPenis
[5:03:32] <%demegodz> Neat
[5:03:34] <+evbites> Thats strong
[5:03:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oops sound like they're more trouble than their potential benefit.
[5:03:37] <Aydarkzero> your poop is trapped now
[5:03:37] <%miguelrod777> STRONG
[5:03:43] <heartlesshealer> Pat, you would get no phone use
[5:03:48] <clockworknait1> @jpstudmuffin I was hoping it would be out by Halloween
[5:03:51] <+pkmamsters> so like...time only stops as the poops comin out?
[5:03:51] <heartlesshealer> the phone transmissions would stop with time
[5:03:59] <heartlesshealer> thanks for hosting
[5:04:01] <%RyTYoung> Thank all and goodnight!
[5:04:02] <ToneBacas> Pat would eat the weirdest shit just so he could keep on pooping non-stop
[5:04:03] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[5:04:04] <Klarrann3> would the poop not hover in the air as soon as it leaves your body?
[5:04:05] <%Aleate> Not thanking Zangief otzMAD
