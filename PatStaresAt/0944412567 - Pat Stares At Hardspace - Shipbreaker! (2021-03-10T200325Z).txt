[0:30:43] <+queaks> Your noticing of this notice has been noted
[0:30:44] <%coward_man> why pay to fix the bugs when modders do it for free?
[0:30:45] <HeroToxiko> the team is great they just don't listen to them
[0:30:47] <%Invlux> They FIND bugs, but no one fix them
[0:30:47] <+blastazoid00> That's not very cash money of them
[0:30:47] <$valkuma> @PatStaresAt how much backseating are you cool with for this game cause its one of my favorites
[0:30:48] <+Sendrak70> Thats fair, can only hope the idiots who manage that shit dont get carried over.
[0:30:48] <$RealThiele> mods will fix it so they are lazy
[0:30:51] <MrNoobMcSalt> man that sounds like a thankless hell hole of a position
[0:30:52] <Laecerelius> A detailed list of bugs to give to modders to fix the game for them
[0:30:53] <%cvp5127> ship it
[0:30:54] <%Teintstein> that's got to be so depressing
[0:30:55] <DaKnightWarrior> That's sad.
[0:30:57] <%blastyoboots> @coward_man exactly
[0:30:58] <HeroToxiko> that server is fucking full LUL
[0:30:59] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:30:59] <leole11> they also use a 2006 engine, that doesn't help at all
[0:31:01] <%coward_man> shock
[0:31:02] <+7gryphons> shocking no one
[0:31:02] <ToneBacas> what a fucking surprise
[0:31:02] <+blastazoid00> No shit
[0:31:02] <+Deekman> they're like that monitoring station in Lost
[0:31:07] <%BoomerSqueaker> All the old bethesda titles get left in the dust too
[0:31:09] <LVL1_Scumbag> Then why have the QA in the first place?
[0:31:09] <+Sendrak70> No shit its the engine. its the same one from 13 years ago.
[0:31:09] <+queaks> But why make new engine though>>
[0:31:12] <+gimmickypizza> It's always the engine it sucks
[0:31:12] <+b_aleph> Who would have thunk?
[0:31:13] <heartlesshealer> never throw your QA team under the bus. They WILL find your bugs
[0:31:14] <+trackles_64> No shit everyone knows the engine is to old
[0:31:15] <vile_brand> who'da thunk it was the engine
[0:31:16] <MrPandastic> WHAT A SURPRISE
[0:31:19] <%thejvc93> So what about the new game? New engine?
[0:31:20] <aiutare47> It’s always the engine
[0:31:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They hate that Engine more than General Fucking Custard
[0:31:21] <+thegreenbenis> No shit.
[0:31:21] <Borkbiff > Gamebrio or something, what's it called?
[0:31:23] <PinoProxie> IT JUST WERKS
[0:31:26] <MayorRev> How much spaghetti code do they have
[0:31:27] <%Reveresao> They are supposed to get upgrades right?
[0:31:29] <HeroToxiko> "but muh proprietary technology"
[0:31:30] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> @dk_scrub The real issue I had wasn't even that, wild as it seemed to me, it was the fuckers who left their car alarm on for a full 2 hours after midnight in the parking lot as they stood out there and argued, and didn't stop it until I got up and shouted at them from the motel balcony
[0:31:33] <%Dunmarkh> @queaks they are
[0:31:33] <leole11> Gamebryo, yes
[0:31:35] <%blaggablag> Imagine if bethesda changed to unreal and every single problem fixed itself OVERNIGHT
[0:31:38] <CalusRaccoon> I have worked a year and a half QA for software that has nothing to do with games. It's insane how much game devs hate fixing bugs/ how accepted they are in the business.
[0:31:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's not that surprising considering how jank garbage that engine is
[0:31:44] <+D00msDayDan> very efficient
[0:31:46] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt How would you feel if bethesda moved to another companies engine like Unreal
[0:31:48] <%Teintstein> LUL
[0:31:50] <+thegreenbenis> That engine has been shit since at least Morrowind.
[0:31:52] <+blastazoid00> wow
[0:31:52] <heartlesshealer> just copy/paste bug list
[0:31:57] <+gimmickypizza> Officiant QA
[0:31:59] <AFlyingTaco1> Re-bugging is some powerful tech
[0:31:59] <+Brightstreak> pat, any plans to play satisfactory?
[0:32:04] <+Brightstreak> *stream it
[0:32:04] <leole11> you can STILL wrong warp by sitting and opening a door at the same time
[0:32:07] <+Sendrak70> The only benefits for using an old engine like they have been is developmental familiarity and reduced QA times.
[0:32:16] <%Teintstein> so they just make lists and hand them off to Bethesda leadership to put directly into a shredder
[0:32:29] <%ClericOfSparda> since Microsoft now owns Bethesda, do you think they'll actually overhaul the engine?
[0:32:39] <heartlesshealer> it's hard to get worse
[0:32:44] <$RealThiele> minecraft is the only game ive seen that wasnt destroyed by acquisition
[0:32:47] <%cvp5127> "it just works"
[0:32:48] <leole11> @Teintstein  "oh wow that's crazy dude!" *shreds*
[0:32:48] <+Sendrak70> They were already developing a new engine for the next ES game series.
[0:32:50] <+b_aleph> Has to be what?
[0:32:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> could things potentially get better now that Microsoft owns Bethesda?
[0:32:56] <%blastyoboots> if they had been bought by EA Games it would have been identical
[0:32:58] <+gimmickypizza> They do?
[0:33:01] <Laecerelius> I hope so.  If not, not much sleep lost on Bethsoft dying at this point.
[0:33:02] <Borkbiff > Maybe some of their games will pop out on the gamepass, so that's something
[0:33:04] <%aishman> Like Crackdown 3?
[0:33:05] <%AmericanaRed> THE HALO ENGINE Kreygasm 4Head
[0:33:05] <+D00msDayDan> counterpoint: halo 5
[0:33:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So Microsoft Good?
[0:33:06] <$valkuma> imagine EA buying bethesda
[0:33:11] <AFlyingTaco1> Mostly
[0:33:13] <%Buzzard42> @RealThiele That's why I have faith in this bethesda acquisition, they don't seem interested in touching studios
[0:33:15] <+b_aleph> Polish? Like cyberpunk?
[0:33:23] <DaKnightWarrior> Phill will be watching Todd.
[0:33:23] <KingVantq> @aishman wasnt broken just boring and bad

[0:33:35] <%aishman> True
[0:33:36] <LVL1_Scumbag> Can't ship with known bugs if you never QA
[0:33:37] <+trackles_64> Not testing the game doesnt mean its not buggy

[0:42:42] <%Movemeister> the matrix is many things

[0:43:37] <+Deekman> @ExpressNode I'm selling mine, i hate it lol
[0:43:41] <%blaggablag> Ironically the character with the most quotable line of the movie
[0:43:49] <%barrakuta371> Pat Matrix Lore Stream when?
[0:44:03] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> chat, has he talked anything about doing a proper sea of solitude playthrough?
[0:44:05] <nomolomo> and before the big internet
[0:44:07] <%Snowybreak> you are absolutely hitting a ton of points the community goes for
[0:44:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> That's why I love writing-- it gets you to be more open minded w/o you even realizing it
[0:44:11] <+gimmickypizza> Whose counting
[0:44:13] <%Movemeister> yeye
[0:44:17] <nomolomo> so finding stuff like that back in the day was even a bigger deal
[0:44:25] <%Broand> I mean it's also a big analogy for Gnostic thought.
[0:44:25] <HeroToxiko> WHOOOOO
[0:44:26] <%Buzzard42> HE'S SO HOT
[0:44:27] <%BoxNavy> yeah he is

[0:44:48] <Borkbiff > They don't make em like they used tp
[0:45:02] <@SoFarFetched> @SaltkeyAndAckfish don't think he plans on revisiting it. Since it gave him the feels bad afterwards
[0:45:03] <+Midashu> they wanted to go for "black people can be racist too"
[0:45:06] <+Shacklebox> It's like 50% now
[0:45:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Art is so damn COMPLEX
[0:45:14] <anAngryHamster> Don't forget The Wizard of Oz and it's influence on the LGBT movement
[0:45:20] <+Deekman> hey he ruled in butterfly effect
[0:45:22] <$RealThiele> yea sea of solitude likely done
[0:45:22] <parkslady> LOL
[0:45:22] <Gorgs7> Pat is correct
[0:45:22] <%YakumoYomi> He cheated on Demi Moore, didn't he?
[0:45:25] <parkslady> the butterfly effect
[0:45:29] <Meekest> He did his best in Final Destination and he got his head cut off
[0:45:30] <%tuesti> LUL
[0:45:30] <heartlesshealer> true
[0:45:30] <%mikessdd> Oh yeah the original is so good. That shit at the end where her lines translate to her real relationship with the actor was nuts.
[0:45:31] <SilverFaustX> was a good movie
[0:45:37] <HeroToxiko> he was playing a scammer in the movie anyway LUL
[0:45:38] <%brickwall35> Ashton Kutcher is one of the biggest anti-human traffickers in the world

[0:46:08] <%BoxNavy> LOL
[0:46:15] <%YakumoYomi> Has to be Activision, then
[0:46:16] <HeroToxiko> @ReallyBigRocks KappaHD
[0:46:16] <marvel877> That was back when Kutcher was still a meh actor. Butterfly Effect wasn't him trying, that dumb Steve Jobs movie was him tring.
[0:46:19] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @SoFarFetched ah, but he hsan't mentioned it? Also just my opinion, but the fact that it gives him the feels is PRECISELY why he should keep playing it :)
[0:46:20] <DrkJP520> lmao

[0:47:52] <@SoFarFetched> @SaltkeyAndAckfish yeah cause usually sponsored streams are one offs unless Pat shows actual interest in playing it afterwards. He didn't seem to big on finishing it since it was a short stream and its a game you could beat in one stream.

[0:48:56] <Rionxgarland> in my tweets above pats tweet about going live in hardspace is a tweet from the devs saying the datacenter is on fire what did you do pat
[0:48:57] <+b_aleph> this can't be serious
[0:49:00] <%coward_man> I got stabbed in the face during science class and I got in trouble for punching him to the ground
[0:49:01] <Deekman> @PatStaresAt didn't you go to the police?
[0:49:01] <heartlesshealer> so a weapon weapon
[0:49:02] <BaronVonProlix> not like a toy shocker thing? a legit non lethal weapon?
[0:49:02] <aiutare47> WAIT WHAT
[0:49:03] <scrumbotime> Was it funny?
[0:49:04] <+SlashHabit> you mentioned it in the condemned playthrough
[0:49:04] <%isa_sensei96> how'd  he sneak that in school?
[0:49:04] <SilverFaustX> tazers are illegal here
[0:49:08] <beatie_g> you mean the one you gotta STABE someone with?
[0:49:10] <winner_92> how did he not get like tried in front of a jury as a minor
[0:49:12] <%toolofparanoia> what the fuck that fucker better have been suspended
[0:49:14] <beatie_g> stab
[0:49:14] <metabot64> uhh can't someone die from that shit
[0:49:16] <heartlesshealer> STILL WEAPON
[0:49:16] <aiutare47> THATS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL IN THE USA
[0:49:18] <%toolofparanoia> good
[0:49:20] <%Movemeister> no weapon is non lethal
[0:49:22] <heartlesshealer> A SHIRT CAN BE LETHAL
[0:49:22] <Djinnazz> so is a baseball bat
[0:49:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I can't stand assholes blaming sjw culture for non-political shit like that
[0:49:24] <tanarath> It isn't non-lethal
[0:49:24] <nomolomo> i hope he chokes on a dick, pathetically
[0:49:25] <mr_red117> most schools dont have metal detectors
[0:49:25] <rafaelba93> less lethal
[0:49:26] <%BoxNavy> like its not an AK a tazer is fuckin puny
[0:49:30] <+b_aleph> Didn't they let taze him back?
[0:49:30] <s1rcuit> a lot of schools don't do weapon searches
[0:49:31] <+queaks> I had a kid light my arm hair on fire with a lighter
[0:49:33] <%Piemono> It's not like most schools frisk you
[0:49:35] <%coward_man> @PatStaresAt I got stabbed in the face during science class and I got in trouble for punching him to the ground
[0:49:36] <PirateMike_> lol metal detector in school is a good sign for america
[0:49:38] <tanarath> It can cause permanent nerve damage
[0:49:39] <Gorgs7> A dude at my school stole the bear spray my dad sent me on a field trip with and sprayed it in my face on the bus, and I'm the one that got suspended
[0:49:40] <%toolofparanoia> PatTazedBy An Asshole
[0:49:42] <+b_aleph> let you taze him back
[0:49:45] <%Invlux> Kids have it rough
[0:49:46] <%isa_sensei96> Canadian schools are weird...
[0:49:50] <%Piemono> also if an area's that bad, a tazer might not be a bad idea
[0:49:53] <%Ziegsy> I was pinned to a wall by my bully with a box cutter to my neck. I cook a chance and headbutted her. I broke her nose. Despite witnesses, I got suspended because 'a broken nose is punishment enough'
[0:49:54] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt they don't check here at all
[0:49:55] <%blaggablag> what sort of no-child-left-behind bullshit lets a kid go without being expelled after that
[0:49:56] <SilverFaustX> concealed weapon is even more illegal
[0:49:58] <BaronVonProlix> i had a kid empty a can of bear mace on the second floor of my highschool back in the day, that was fun
[0:50:01] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt not yet. My kids school is considering it
[0:50:06] <%DappercatEsquire> can't hear Paige for shit
[0:50:07] <%Arancet> @beatie_g the gun kind stabs you, it pierces the skin, the tiny melee kind is just and arc of electricity
[0:50:09] <%Invlux> This is JUST like 1984
[0:50:10] <$RealThiele> whats a few crimes between friends
[0:50:11] <IntrepidEye> No school I've ever been too down here have metal detectors.
[0:50:11] <%afronooch> pre-Colombine school is a lot like pre-9/11 airports
[0:50:11] <nomolomo> people are garbage, thats why i stay inside
[0:50:12] <heartlesshealer> imagine pantsing a woman in public. It IS assault
[0:50:15] <aiutare47> That’s considered a weapon in the US, not a lethal one but it bumps up the assault crime
[0:50:16] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @SoFarFetched no i get that, it's just i really thought he connected with it and that's why he'd want to keep playing it. But I also get that it's a reason for not wanting to keep playing it as well :)
[0:50:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> When will you LEARN?! That your actions have CONSEQUENCES?!?!
[0:50:20] <Applepieenthusiast> i remember when people in my school did that thousand years of death bs
[0:50:20] <%Bailey__gaming> our school was pretty rough, there were litteral knife fights at the shops that were near the school, many many teenage pregnancys
[0:50:20] <beatie_g> dude school sucks and kids are psychos
[0:50:21] <%Buzzard42> we can hear you
[0:50:22] <%BoxNavy> we can kinda hear paige
[0:50:22] <+MooseIsGoose> Mine was too.
[0:50:23] <%maybefalco> @coward_man thats super fucked
[0:50:23] <+D00msDayDan> ugh PC culture trying to stop me from being an asshole for no good reason
[0:50:23] <+queaks> Growing up in NZ was honestly pretty chill
[0:50:26] <kenny_biff> we LIKE THE DOG NOISE
[0:50:26] <winner_92> thats the "bullying is fine because it made me into the bitter asshole i am" mentality

[0:50:31] <s1rcuit> @BaronVonProlix did they spray someone or just spray objects?
[0:50:35] <+b_aleph> You went to the prison school Woolie was talking about?
[0:50:36] <%brickwall35> I agree but there's certainly things that an adulting doing is worse than a kid doing
[0:50:47] <+Opal_Overture> @afronooch And both are equally ineffectual. :)
[0:50:51] <beatie_g> ITS JUST A PRANK
[0:50:52] <heartlesshealer> that's a jail man
[0:50:52] <Sol_Install> WHAT!?
[0:50:52] <SilverFaustX> D:
[0:50:55] <Sol_Install> What happen!?
[0:50:59] <mikessdd> Even in the US I’ve never been in a public school with a metal detector. They exist but you need money for that shit.
[0:51:00] <DaKnightWarrior> Just a PRANK
[0:51:03] <HeroToxiko> yup
[0:51:04] <SilverFaustX> ghost all toxic ppl
[0:51:05] <parkslady> I remember working at a school a while back where a boy literally pulled down a girl's top exposing her to everyone and being surprised he just didn't get kicked out immediately
[0:51:06] <%AmericanaRed> Dogs don't go to heaven HahaThink
[0:51:07] <Djinnazz> that's already normal
[0:51:08] <leole11> HMMMM
[0:51:09] <BaronVonProlix> @s1rcuit no clue, we were told school was closing early and you could FEEL it when walking down the stairs
[0:51:09] <%Invlux> Hell yeah, burn
[0:51:11] <%DappercatEsquire> i had a former friend that always said "why are you being so dramatic?" when i'd ask him to stop doing fucked up shit
[0:51:12] <+BluBarracuda> burn them anyway
[0:51:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Burn them bridges like it's Blitzkreig
[0:51:15] <%BoxNavy> normalize bridge burning culture
[0:51:16] <aiutare47> Yeah, kids should not touch other kids pants.
[0:51:16] <+Midashu> those people don't go away unfortunately, they usually just end up getting worse
[0:51:18] <+BluBarracuda> say fuck it
[0:51:18] <parkslady> fuck that
[0:51:19] <IntrepidEye> Sadly I actually heard someone say that when their kid poisoned their neighbors dog
[0:51:21] <leole11> nah, eat a dick, that one guy
[0:51:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh dude I'm 10000% ok with doing that and have done that
[0:51:24] <Tracazoid> Gotta worry about their feelings, even the assholes...
[0:51:25] <%coward_man> @maybefalco yeah it was like 2 inches under my eye, but hey I was bigger and louder whilst being nearly blinded so I got sent home for it
[0:51:26] <%cvp5127> just dont have any bridges
[0:51:27] <Sol_Install> yea fuck that, i not gonna to fucking be nice forever
[0:51:27] <%YakumoYomi> Burn to the ground!
[0:51:28] <Jaysky> I had a friend who would side completely with the people bullying me so he could pretend to be cool, then the minute they bully was gone I'd ask, "Wtf man?" and he'd respond with "I was just joking man"
[0:51:28] <anAngryHamster> Some bridges are safety hazards and need a controlled burn
[0:51:33] <s1rcuit> people who are like "animals don't have feelings" are monsters that should be destroyed
[0:51:38] <%Aarseth> naw fuck that
[0:51:38] <+ThomasOfTroy> Fuck this shitty, rotten bridge that should have been torn down years ago
[0:51:41] <+LuKVai> Bridge goes DOWN
[0:51:45] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt Yeah fuck that guy I have no regrets
[0:51:47] <%SnackinOnChimps> The great American saying: ‘We will burn that bridge when we get to it’
[0:51:50] <+BluBarracuda> burn it and who cares if it's rude. they're an asshole
[0:51:50] <%coward_man> Pat I LITERALLY had that!
[0:51:51] <BaronVonProlix> pat you're supposed to lie down on the ground and wait for them to stop!
[0:51:59] <+b_aleph> He didn't get to stab you tho!
[0:52:01] <atomizedstream> fuckin Pee-Sea culture these days, can't believe I'm getting canceled just because I murdered someone
[0:52:09] <%tuesti> hate that
[0:52:09] <%brickwall35> VVomyn
[0:52:10] <Jaysky> And I've got a sister that's beaten the shit out of my dad 4 different times and my family asks why I'm not treating my sister the same
[0:52:13] <parkslady> I got the emotional comment too Paige
[0:52:16] <+Shacklebox> You should kick their ass
[0:52:17] <%Ziegsy> 'I dont like being bullied.' 'Are YoU oN YoUr PerIoD?!'
[0:52:18] <%Arancet> i got "theres nothing i can do about it so forget it"
[0:52:22] <+Shacklebox> The solution is an ass kicking
[0:52:22] <PirateMike_> The problem with women is...
[0:52:26] <leole11> teachers don't care
[0:52:29] <ExpressNode> I remember I almost got written up in school once because a kid tried to fight me for accidentally stepping on his binder.  Guy was an asshole.
[0:52:31] <%blaggablag> While there's a place for social ostrazication there is something about driving someone to a point where they get nothing to lose. Those people need intervention, not just expulsion. That doesn't fix the problem.
[0:52:31] <sentientvin> yup
[0:52:34] <%Bailey__gaming> Teachers did f**k all about bullying in school caus its like 1 persons word against another
[0:52:35] <metabot64> definitely agree
[0:52:37] <Parapattern> The problem with bullying is that it stems from larger societal problems
[0:52:38] <+gimmickypizza> Message check
[0:52:42] <+MooseIsGoose> I will never forget that they did not take a student out of my middle school that stabbed a girl in the eye.
[0:52:46] <%AmericanaRed> BULLY 101
[0:52:47] <+Deekman> I had a group of guys throw me on to rail road tracks during the 8th grade. That shit is for real
[0:52:59] <HeroToxiko> the "phys ed teacher" oops he was a jock who peaked in high school
[0:53:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'd love to see how bullies would react to an eye-for-an-eye policy
[0:53:13] <BaronVonProlix> at my Jr High we were told that if we got jumped, just curl into the fucking fetal position and wait for it to stop, im dead serious
[0:53:14] <Tracazoid> That's a good teacher right there
[0:53:17] <IntrepidEye> They really don't give a shit. I had a class where a girl was made fun of so bad she ran out crying and the teacher had her suspended for leaving without permission
[0:53:18] <HeroToxiko> English teachers were pretty cool tbh
[0:53:18] <%BoxNavy> lol
[0:53:19] <Jaysky> SHAMING WORKS

[0:53:22] <%Invlux> LUL what a homie
[0:53:26] <DaKnightWarrior> good
[0:53:27] <PirateMike_> Best teacher
[0:53:27] <%AmericanaRed> EMOTIONAL SCARE MOMENT
[0:53:29] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt The zero tolerance policy might also be a factor.
[0:53:29] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[0:53:30] <+gimmickypizza> Old people rule
[0:53:36] <+D00msDayDan> that teacher's holding on to their one
[0:53:36] <dan_g_v> badass teacher
[0:53:38] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:53:41] <Tracazoid> LUL That's the best
[0:53:42] <%Valdorick> That's a teacher who deserves more than one.
[0:53:43] <parkslady> that's amazing
[0:53:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> We more teachers w/ spines
[0:53:45] <PirateMike_> She had tenor I nest
[0:53:47] <aiutare47> I knew some kids who took it into their own hands. A guy sexually assaulted a girl at a party; the school wouldn’t do anything because “no hard evidence”. Guy got beat daily in the hallway.
[0:53:49] <heartlesshealer> <3
[0:53:51] <PirateMike_> bet*
[0:53:51] <HeroToxiko> tenure: the best weapon
[0:53:51] <%AmericanaRed> SH3 STOLE HIS HEART
[0:53:52] <%BoxNavy> ancient, tired teachers are cool
[0:53:53] <%Arancet> i had an english teacher like that, then the bully poured ant poison in her tea
[0:53:55] <%Movemeister> Sometimes those ones are good, sometimes those ones are BAD
[0:54:00] <+spitelite> i had an english teacher like that
[0:54:00] <%isa_sensei96> Tenure is great, ain't it?
[0:54:01] <winner_92> that's a teacher who hasn't cashed in her One yet
[0:54:01] <scrumbotime> I got "lucky" where I didn't get bullied so much towards the last few years, but only because by that point I had gotten to the point of not being fun to bully anymore.
[0:54:02] <+threamstream> hey, former educator here. It's a lot more complicated than that. A lot of teachers truly want to do more but the biggest problem preventing is resources. Especially in the US with No Child Left Behind, most teachers are so constantly swamped they have no time to be able to do anything. Admin also doesn't really have your back, since they only work to appease the board, not teachers or students
[0:54:04] <+Deekman> did she do it in French?
[0:54:07] <anAngryHamster> Shaming works as long as the bully doesn't have some antisocial personality disorder
[0:54:09] <IntrepidEye> The kind of teacher who'd tell a kid to shut the fuck up without mincing words
[0:54:09] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> i got tenure bitch and probably ten years left at that i have no time for your shit"
[0:54:09] <heartlesshealer> "I'm old, I don't have time for your shit."
[0:54:11] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh yeah no teachers usually don't give a shit. I had one teacher who stood up for me once, but he got kicked out for doing something similar for another student.
[0:54:13] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:54:15] <%Invlux> monkaS
[0:54:17] <%McCloud90> getting thrown out of french class cos i got stabbed in the hand with a fountain pen, and im the disturbance woo school
[0:54:17] <Tracazoid> Wow talk about escalation
[0:54:18] <Bathezid> monkaS
[0:54:19] <+vicar_anat> Lol, as an English teacher myself, I feel I'd say the same too
[0:54:19] <%takotoots> wut
[0:54:20] <%BinaryFireball> thats a murder
[0:54:20] <ToneBacas> big crimes
[0:54:22] <leole11> don't worry, the teacher isn't an ant
[0:54:22] <heartlesshealer> WHAT
[0:54:22] <%Valdorick> That's not a bully, that's a psycopath
[0:54:23] <HeroToxiko> Whoa

[0:54:25] <+VietcongSamurai> monkaS
[0:54:25] <%blaggablag> Those are good cause they could have retired a while ago, but they're doing it for their own sake at that point
[0:54:26] <PirateMike_> Thats a fucking psycopath
[0:54:27] <+eanscrale> Yikes
[0:54:28] <dan_g_v> that kid ain't gonna last past their 20s
[0:54:28] <DaKnightWarrior> NotLikeThis
[0:54:33] <%Arancet> some other kid took the fall for it, the actual kid avoided punishment
[0:54:34] <devanmuse> that's a few steps above "bullying"
[0:54:36] <heartlesshealer> this a juvenile sentence immediately
[0:54:37] <Rionxgarland> waht was he mr 47
[0:54:37] <%Bailey__gaming> I WONDER WHY
[0:54:38] <dan_g_v> like horses?

[0:54:50] <$Treuan> He went to go live on a farm
[0:54:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> She probably disappeared for being a "whore" LUL
[0:54:52] <heartlesshealer> that P4 teacher?
[0:54:59] <%walternatorz> 4th Grade Mr. A
[0:55:00] <RoamV> I had a teacher in 9th grade Science that did a lot of the same and was so intense on the first day that he caused a few kids to cry on the first day.
[0:55:00] <%rekinom> We had a science teacher "disappear" because he got a 17 year old knocked up
[0:55:03] <%Ebonyglow> for me it was the German teacher
[0:55:05] <+Mr_ZombieFetish> my teacher got arrested for having sex with his students
[0:55:05] <+thelonechris> My 2nd grade teacher was an alcoholic who secretly drank during class
[0:55:05] <parkslady> one of my elementary teachers turned out to be a pedo that was a trip
[0:55:06] <DaKnightWarrior> I had one of those
[0:55:07] <%tuesti> SAME

[0:55:18] <ExpressNode> Oh yeah I remember that shit.
[0:55:20] <%Apathiae> I had a teacher leave her husband to marry one of her students.
[0:55:21] <%shruke> We had a 6th grade teacher who got caught with "STUFF" on his work laptop
[0:55:22] <%YakumoYomi> Three fingers wide for the straps, and your skirt had to be down past your fingertips
[0:55:22] <aiutare47> America is all the same
[0:55:26] <HeroToxiko> middle school math teacher, he just left for lunch mid day and never came back
[0:55:28] <dk_scrub> my art teacher got addicted to painkillers and threw his crutches at a student
[0:55:30] <+gimmickypizza> Shame shirts
[0:55:30] <+MooseIsGoose> I had one that did but not for good reasons. Students and teachers kept going after and making fun of this teacher who was gay.
[0:55:33] <+b_aleph> What's a spaghetti strap?
[0:55:34] <%Valdorick> My teacher who did that was a drunkard who admitted that he beat his dog. And threw stuff at students. And after being fired, went into the school and took a shit on a table in the cafeteria.
[0:55:37] <heartlesshealer> @winner_92 true

[0:56:02] <+Midashu> same thing happens with Preachers Daughters
[0:56:03] <s1rcuit> I had a cool agri teacher in highschool where one time we were planting flowers and I was the only willing to literally get my hands dirty and I was crouched down and a kid was standing behind me mocking me because he could see the band of my underwear and she came over and wiped her muddy hands on his hands
[0:56:06] <+mr_drucifer> had an agriculture teacher who got the boot for wanking it in his truck
[0:56:09] <IntrepidEye> Had a middle school teacher vanish because it was suspected she was fucking a student. nothing came of it she just dipped out of the blue

[0:56:25] <BaronVonProlix> @aiutare47 exactly, lol
[0:56:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, having SOME dress code standards is important. But a lot of folks care too much
[0:56:29] <Jaysky> God I wish I could go back in time with my current mentality
[0:56:33] <parkslady> well actually back then I just hit people, I wish I was better at roasting like I am now
[0:56:36] <worldbrand> hey kyle you're inadequate
[0:56:37] <HeroToxiko> I had teachers legit tell me they'd be fired for saying something
[0:56:37] <%Vextalyst> Yeah I haven't talked to that POS in years but I wouldn't be surprised to find out his shit kid was expelled cuz from what I heard the bullying was severe and people like that don't stop
[0:56:39] <mikessdd> I had a first grade teacher try to get our whole class out on Ritalin. Because she wanted to teach a zombie class. She was gone for a year and when she came back she always had a classroom aid.

[1:01:35] <+VietcongSamurai> LUL
[1:01:35] <scrumbotime> Already thinking about the Preogonet
[1:01:36] <NoCreditClear> The perfect solution
[1:01:37] <Tracazoid> Yeah there it is
[1:01:38] <@commanderclaw> Unfortunately you can't totally control that. Sometimes kids are shit from the cradle
[1:01:38] <%Reveresao> The kid that carries two knives in their shirt
[1:01:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Tuff Love
[1:01:38] <DaKnightWarrior> BEAT him
[1:01:40] <nomolomo> drown them like an icelandic mother

[1:01:47] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> uh
[1:01:47] <peachy996> Just make a new one
[1:01:48] <yourliteraldog> If your kid is bully, then you have bully your kid. Gotta Demolish his self esteem
[1:01:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Lovely water
[1:01:50] <+Mr_ZombieFetish> lmao
[1:01:50] <ToneBacas> waterboarding monkaS
[1:01:50] <BoxNavy> not true
[1:01:51] <aiutare47> I’m with pat
[1:01:51] <%Emperor_Machinus> Just a little drowning, for character
[1:01:51] <+crazyspartan214> tough love
[1:01:52] <goatcommander717> there is no way your kid is going to be normal
[1:01:53] <The_500lb_Child> Judo Flip the Child, Pat!
[1:01:55] <%blaggablag> do NOT drown the child
[1:01:55] <%BinaryFireball> lack of oxygen
[1:01:55] <%BoxNavy> oxygen sucks
[1:01:55] <redrins> drown em in disappointment
[1:01:56] <PirateMike_> A lack of oxygen
[1:01:57] <+MooseIsGoose> You mean lack of it.
[1:01:58] <worldbrand> oxygen toxicity is also a thing
[1:01:58] <%twoto858> Gotta start a new save
[1:01:59] <scrumbotime> Do that kid that like Joe Biden did those dogs in the rallys
[1:02:01] <%Ziegsy> No to drowning. got it. what about water boarding?
[1:02:04] <Meekest> YOU HAVE ONE his name is Zangief
[1:02:05] <nomolomo> pat has evil seed
[1:02:06] <%tuesti> "YEAH" LUL
[1:02:06] <+Midashu> the bad seed
[1:02:06] <%DappercatEsquire> just rollin the die sometimes
[1:02:07] <%Frost_Quill> But what if your kid is actually the one getting bullied and they're painting him/her as a bully?
[1:02:07] <yourliteraldog> If they have to much self esteem
[1:02:08] <%mikessdd> Paige there are lost causes. There are kids that are born poison and stay that way.
[1:02:09] <%Arancet> lack of oxygen certainly stunts character
[1:02:09] <%Ghufufin> just shave off the mustache!
[1:02:09] <%AncelDeLambert> genetics is a lottery, Paige
[1:02:10] <Ser_Ser_Ser> We call is Disciplinary Baptism
[1:02:11] <+Mr_ZombieFetish> He's right

[1:02:12] <yourliteraldog> You might
[1:02:12] <sendart> some kids are just assholes
[1:02:13] <PirateMike_> He could just be born a psycopath
[1:02:13] <aiutare47> Revoke their breathing privileges Patrick
[1:02:13] <%ClericOfSparda> some kids are just assholes
[1:02:15] <%maybefalco> pat's right, some are just evil seeds
[1:02:16] <%blaggablag> I heard dihidrogen oxigen can be pretty bad for you
[1:02:16] <%Valdorick> Doubt
[1:02:17] <+gimmickypizza> You might tho

[1:02:17] <Meekest> YOU'LL JUST WHAT
[1:02:17] <HeroToxiko> "the good son"
[1:02:19] <%Emperor_Machinus> Some kids are Damians
[1:02:19] <nomolomo> evil seed!
[1:02:20] <@commanderclaw> Lincoln will curse your child
[1:02:20] <%AgniBrandt> There are ALWAYS factors in development you can't control
[1:02:21] <heartlesshealer> THE WITCH CURSE
[1:02:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> The Omen
[1:02:21] <%cvp5127> witches curse
[1:02:21] <%Shackle_Rustyford> hold it in through the power trimester
[1:02:21] <yourliteraldog> Like we all have that potential
[1:02:22] <%Mr_Pylon> Could be witch cursed to have evil offspring
[1:02:22] <softbirby> some people do be born evil
[1:02:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> it happens
[1:02:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige you have ZERO control over your genetics
[1:02:23] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[1:02:24] <%Gogogolem> what a a c-section of an evil child?
[1:02:24] <Rionxgarland> 2:00 defeat the baby
[1:02:24] <%Shackle_Rustyford> like the gold ole days
[1:02:26] <%arcielardor> she's going to give birth to a toilet
[1:02:26] <+thegreenbenis> Oh lord Paige is talkin' bout babies.
[1:02:27] <%Movemeister> What if Abraham Lincoln demands it, Paige?
[1:02:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> It can happen to you too!!!!!!!!!
[1:02:28] <NoCreditClear> "coolest"
[1:02:28] <%ClericOfSparda> psaBlind
[1:02:28] <%brickwall35> you guys bully people all the time, although they generally deserve it for being awful

[1:02:33] <BaronVonProlix> Hannibal Boivin
[1:02:36] <lucky_icarus> MORE LIKE CRUELEST!
[1:02:36] <DaKnightWarrior> Little Demon Jimmy
[1:02:36] <aiutare47> Pat’s wretched cum
[1:02:38] <parkslady> uh oh it's starting LUL
[1:02:38] <%emperordread> Saying you won't have an evil kid (because of course, right?) is the first step to having an evil kid
[1:02:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pure even
[1:02:43] <MrPandastic> Unless it isn't.
[1:02:43] <+crazyspartan214> said every upcoming mother
[1:02:46] <s1rcuit> doesn't matter really
[1:02:50] <Paciboyy> THE PRESSURE OF BEING THE COOLEST CHILD WILL MAKE HIM EVIL
[1:02:52] <+thegreenbenis> Evil nut
[1:02:52] <+Opal_Overture> @aiutare47 no
[1:02:52] <xbb1024> You can't be born evil, you can only become evil through action
[1:02:52] <AdmiralButtloaf> It's the Witch's Curse
[1:02:53] <%Invlux> "the weight of eyes" is cool as fuck
[1:02:53] <%Bailey__gaming> Cursed Cummings
[1:02:54] <heartlesshealer> But really, believe in you two being able to raise a kid right. Just hope they're good to the animals
[1:02:55] <%Arancet> uh no
[1:02:58] <yourliteraldog> Pat's Evil Seed
[1:02:59] <%Rumbutt> one day on pluto...?
[1:03:01] <nomolomo> my heart goes out to all the teachers that have to use zoom for classes
[1:03:03] <%Frost_Quill> Most parents with evil kids will swear up and down that they don't have an evil kid.
[1:03:05] <peachy996> What if your child is an 8 foot tall superhealthy person with no add or mindgoblins?
[1:03:10] <Turbanator44568> obstinate defiant children are a thing. they're basically unempathetic monsters due to mental health and behavioral disorders.
[1:03:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Google it
[1:03:13] <%BoxNavy> i constantly forget that paige is for real cursed by a witch
[1:03:19] <%AncelDeLambert> our months are determined by the lunar cycle, why would there be months on Pluto?
[1:03:22] <+thegreenbenis> Pat's manlet seed.
[1:03:23] <@SoFarFetched> Nerd Scott and Bitch  Ricky
[1:03:26] <%Valdorick> THE RETURN OF BITCH RICKY

[1:03:32] <Rionxgarland> pat should play breathedge its pretty good
[1:03:32] <Paciboyy> my friend : Bitch Ricky!
[1:03:39] <heartlesshealer> Bitch Ricky returns!
[1:03:40] <%blaggablag> Hey bitch ricky!
[1:03:40] <%DappercatEsquire> Bitch Ricky is my favorite new character in the Snyder cut
[1:03:43] <aiutare47> Been a while bitch Ricky
[1:03:47] <BaronVonProlix> Time to revisit the Ishimura!
[1:03:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Remember on the Boondocks where Grandad beat up that kid at the supermarket?
[1:03:51] <NoCreditClear> RAPID DISASSEMBLY LET'S GO
[1:03:52] <%vivaldiva> you've just branded him forever
[1:03:52] <nomolomo> btw paige how is your bathroom streamroom doing?
[1:03:53] <%BoxNavy> paige how's that witch's curse treating you?
[1:03:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> peeeee
[1:03:59] <%JoshManVGH> Damn it! I missed the intro!
[1:04:00] <s1rcuit> I like this game, I hate the name, it's too much. Horizon: Zero Dawn has the same problem
[1:04:04] <yourliteraldog> pee is stored in the balls
[1:04:06] <+D00msDayDan> CUBE
[1:04:07] <+Opal_Overture> PISS BALLS PISS BALLS
[1:04:08] <+thegreenbenis> PEE IS STORED IN THE BALLS
[1:04:14] <%blaggablag> Pee storage confirmed for balls
[1:04:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Alright, folks, what's the over/under on how long it takes Pat to explosively decompress his ship?
[1:04:23] <illTemperedSeaBass> @anceldelambert Our months were determined by fucking Julius Caesar because he felt like it.
[1:04:26] <%garagon31> garagon31 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:04:26] <%Bailey__gaming> What is Pee? if Not Stored in the Balls?
[1:04:30] <%Frost_Quill> I love these streams, I was doing FFXIV shit at 3 and thought i was missing stuff, came in at 4 and now Pat's starting.
[1:04:30] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm giving it half an hour
[1:04:32] <worldbrand> pee storage sounds like a no more heroes speedrun tech
[1:04:37] <+D00msDayDan> @s1rcuit this game has it way better than horizon because shipbreaker is a descriptor that makes sense unlike zero dawn
[1:04:38] <yourliteraldog> 32 Min Exactlt
[1:04:41] <+Opal_Overture> @AncelDeLambert On purpose or accident?
[1:04:45] <%mikessdd> Pre-stream is best part. Damn that was cathartic.
[1:04:45] <MrPandastic> @AncelDeLambert The first cut he makes.
[1:04:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @Opal_Overture yes
[1:04:58] <%JoshManVGH> @anceldelambert whaaaaat kinda space game is this?
[1:05:11] <aiutare47> It’s a junkyard sim
[1:05:15] <leole11> a hard space game
[1:05:17] <aiutare47> A space junkyard
[1:05:18] <leole11> where you break ships
[1:05:20] <Rionxgarland> a debt sim
[1:05:22] <NoCreditClear> @AncelDeLambert The very first Mackeral
[1:05:23] <%Frost_Quill> @JoshManVGH You take apart spaceships.
[1:05:26] <+D00msDayDan> @JoshManVGH first person 6DOF shipbreaking
[1:05:27] <%AncelDeLambert> @JoshManVGH chill derelict junkyard game
[1:05:35] <yourliteraldog> It's "Hard" Space game
[1:06:14] <+Opal_Overture> @JoshManVGH Name sorta says it all. You're the junkyard dude at a space junkyard, BREAKing SHIPS apart and shit.
[1:06:15] <leole11> guaranteed he tries to cut a fuel line without emptying it first
[1:06:29] <BaronVonProlix> Would you call this a good podcast game?
[1:06:33] <DaKnightWarrior> Monster Hunter Rise demo 2 is out tomorrow. can't wait.
[1:06:33] <%AncelDeLambert> btw, have they fixed the Reactor Mark III coolant issue?
[1:06:38] <worldbrand> hey pat but with less pee than usual
[1:06:39] <NoCreditClear> he didn't really empty the balls. he was spying onchat for tips
[1:06:42] <leole11> @BaronVonProlix that's how i play it
[1:06:45] <+parzano> Pat can rats swim
[1:06:47] <yourliteraldog> Doing Space Meth and Stripin Ships
[1:06:50] <+D00msDayDan> @BaronVonProlix oh yeah for sure, cutting up ships is zen as hell
[1:06:54] <aiutare47> Oh pat’s 100% going to send a reactor critical
[1:06:55] <%AncelDeLambert> I stopped playing because there was no sensible way to pull the reactor on large ships
[1:07:02] <+parzano> Pat what would you do if u saw rats swimming in the Ocean
[1:07:04] <illTemperedSeaBass> The fact that Pat's just a big rectangular potato in the intermission screen gets me everytime. Absolutely incredible.
[1:07:04] <BaronVonProlix> Perfect, i really need one of those right now
[1:07:05] <%Valdorick> Yeah, fuck those schools.
[1:07:09] <%BabyandShar> BabyandShar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! CONGRATULATIONS PAT AND PAIGE! My comment calling you a coward, you must have already planned on asking her at that point, huh? Either way, you two deserve each other. Thanks for everything. 15 months already subbed, can't wait for 15+ more.
[1:07:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> What in the fuck
[1:07:15] <%emperordread> That sounds like backchat right there young man, SUSPENDED
[1:07:20] <s1rcuit> @D00msDayDan true, but Horizon's subtitle at least some sense, but only after being in the game for a while
[1:07:23] <+Deekman> yep
[1:07:23] <%tuesti> yes
[1:07:24] <Valdorick> WOW JUST LIKE DON'T!
[1:07:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> You were involved in bad shit, SUSPENDED
[1:07:26] <HeroToxiko> im am actually being strangled "suspended"
[1:07:26] <yourliteraldog> Thats what happened to me
[1:07:26] <parkslady> pretty much
[1:07:27] <+chaumiester> Isn't that a good thing?
[1:07:27] <+queaks> I mean what about people who do manipulate the system though
[1:07:29] <%AncelDeLambert> schools are prisons for children, and I hope homeschooling is WAY more functional by the time I have any
[1:07:31] <+mr_drucifer> One of my best friends got ganged up on by 3 white dudes yelling the gamer word in his face and HE got suspended
[1:07:36] <%Fien111> The lesson to be learned is.....you can't get in any more trouble, just break his nose
[1:07:41] <%coward_man> yeah that super fucked up any respect I had for school's!
[1:07:42] <+mr_drucifer> *was in Tennessee tho
[1:07:43] <+Opal_Overture> @AncelDeLambert Anyway, second ship without a tutorial. No fewer than three "catastrophic failures"
[1:07:43] <%brickwall35> I surprisingly didn't get in any trouble when I refused to fight a kid and he busted my lip. He did get suspended.
[1:07:47] <+Delenay> what about the teachers that purposely turn around and ignore it as you are trying to get their attention
[1:07:49] <aiutare47> Oh you want a one-up? I got suspended for 6 months for shit AT MY HOUSE.
[1:07:51] <BlueSpartan119> LUL
[1:07:53] <%Frost_Quill> There is NO reason in zero tolerance schools to avoid fighting.  If you get attacked hit back as hard as you can, you're getting in trouble anyway better make the asshole hurt.
[1:07:57] <%Treuan> Magical
[1:07:59] <HeroToxiko> the only advantage was he was super weak and i thought he was joking till a teacher noticed
[1:07:59] <%Pukenasty> psaHoldon
[1:08:02] <nomolomo> hype
[1:08:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Don't worry there's basically no settings
[1:08:04] <s1rcuit> I fucking HATE the "it's just as bad cuz you fought back" teachers, fuck them
[1:08:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat pulled a Paige moment
[1:08:11] <+Opal_Overture> @BaronVonProlix It's almost EXPLICITLY a podcast/vibing game
[1:08:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> What is this?
[1:08:14] <jamsbybetty> yeah! let's get HARD!
[1:08:19] <nomolomo> listen to that space sound
[1:08:23] <s1rcuit> agreed
[1:08:25] <%AncelDeLambert> THIS REQUIRES A MOUSE
[1:08:29] <nomolomo> why does it suck?
[1:08:30] <%AncelDeLambert> or VR, when are we getting VR?
[1:08:31] <%ClericOfSparda> good to know
[1:08:37] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> are you what
[1:08:37] <%Jeemukun> I'm still mad this isn't a homeworld game cause gearbox still has the rights to homeworld
[1:08:39] <PirateMike_> Don't play most games on a controller
[1:08:41] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is MADE for vr and yet it has no vr support
[1:08:43] <%blaggablag> If I could play this in VR it would be SO BALLER HOLY SHIT
[1:08:43] <+RabbiKing> that upcoming progression reset tho
[1:08:44] <Bathezid> is this planetes the game?
[1:08:45] <%Chichen> ew
[1:08:45] <%Jeemukun> fuck you randy
[1:08:50] <nomolomo> fucking yikes
[1:08:51] <+TWoods_1993> I thought it was fine on a controller
[1:08:52] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> REBIND IT YOU FOOL
[1:08:52] <%Mr_Pylon> Full space movement in first person is awkward
[1:08:55] <heartlesshealer> clicking sticks for camera is bad
[1:08:58] <%BoomerSqueaker> No love for the david cage motion controls? LUL
[1:08:58] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAT?!
[1:09:00] <%Chichen> oh.
[1:09:01] <BaronVonProlix> oh dude, its why i cant to rainbow 6 on console. clicking the stick is fucking LEAN
[1:09:03] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> literally put the tilt on bumpers
[1:09:04] <%AncelDeLambert> NOT MY POGGERS FUCK
[1:09:04] <%twistedj3ster> I'm finding that any game I can't play with a controller is a game I don't have enough time for :(
[1:09:05] <mikessdd> Better to fight back and get in trouble than be passive and possibly dead.
[1:09:07] <heartlesshealer> are you able to rebind controller?
[1:09:08] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> brakes too
[1:09:08] <%maybefalco> LUL
[1:09:10] <%Chichen> oof.
[1:09:10] <%Jekado> because early access
[1:09:11] <waywardhavoc> oops
[1:09:13] <+D00msDayDan> they still haven't pulled that bandaid? i heard about it months ago
[1:09:14] <%Frost_Quill> I love space games, give us more space games.  I don't care about sports or military shooters, give us more space sims.
[1:09:14] <%brickwall35> cuz it's funny
[1:09:16] <PirateMike_> 'tis the curse
[1:09:18] <dan_g_v> becauase they care about you, Pat
[1:09:18] <%Chichen> well might as well completely change games
[1:09:20] <heartlesshealer> because early access
[1:09:21] <NoCreditClear> Next update supposedly will do a pass on the skill progreession
[1:09:23] <%ClericOfSparda> so that you can mess with them consequence free!
[1:09:25] <%AncelDeLambert> I assume it must be remaking the skill tree
[1:09:25] <worldbrand> sounds like an ideal time to make mistakes though
[1:09:27] <%Jekado> pretty much why i'm waiting for both games
[1:09:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cuz fuck you
[1:09:34] <+SlashHabit> what really?
[1:09:35] <dan_g_v> they want to make you enjoy the full new experience rather than jump in late
[1:09:36] <%twistedj3ster> Because we don't get complete games anymore
[1:09:36] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> imagine playing a game with 3d movement on kbm psaPat
[1:09:39] <%blaggablag> The campaign ain't a "campaign" so much as a grind atm
[1:09:43] <heartlesshealer> nice
[1:09:46] <+queaks> Please do! Love Satisfactory
[1:09:48] <@SoFarFetched> You gonna switch it with Hitman?
[1:09:48] <s1rcuit> please do, I enjoyed the vod for that
[1:09:50] <SaltyAzteca> Satisfactory kinda reminds me of Factorio
[1:09:53] <+Opal_Overture> @PatStaresAt it's just the curse for the Automation Game Era.
[1:09:56] <RoamV> Maybe it's a hidden effect of Crazy Talk?
[1:10:11] <NoCreditClear> Limited i s 30 clones.
[1:10:15] <heartlesshealer> bless
[1:10:15] <PirateMike_> Bless you
[1:10:16] <SaltyAzteca> Das a sneeze

[1:10:22] <+maenos2> maenos2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 12 month anniversary, yay.  I finally subbed when you were doing that RE marathon, and in the year since, you've adopted the dog and got engaged, and meanwhile I had a stroke, so safe to say you had a better year than I.  All good here, and congrats!
[1:10:28] <%Emperor_Machinus> Kermit
[1:10:38] <+Despera__> @PatStaresAt Have you looked at Oxygen Not Included? Might not be your thing since it's not quite direct control but it's really great managing a bunch of gasses
[1:10:38] <%czeekytv> no see
[1:10:41] <%czeekytv> video bad
[1:10:43] <illTemperedSeaBass> Anyone in any position of authority who punishes people, be they adults or children, deserve to be publicly executed on live television. Self-defense is a fucking fundamental right; stripping anyone of that is just complicity with the criminals.
[1:10:45] <KShirahama> Screen Frozen
[1:10:49] <%emperordread> ORBit Kappa
[1:10:49] <+rbakervv> game screen frozen, can't see what you do

[1:10:58] <heartlesshealer> ???
[1:10:58] <%Broand> Just looks like the main menu here
[1:11:00] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt we see the main menu
[1:11:01] <%AncelDeLambert> the intro segment is really obnoxiously unsubtle about the game's really quite minor themes and I wish they'd cut it
[1:11:02] <NoCreditClear> we only see main menu
[1:11:05] <%BigDumBeak> oh weird we just dont see what you are reading

[1:11:21] <heartlesshealer> fixed
[1:11:22] <+thegreenbenis> Oh.
[1:11:23] <+RabbiKing> was wondering where he was reading those difficulty descriptions
[1:11:24] <heartlesshealer> wait pat
[1:11:25] <+thegreenbenis> There we go.
[1:11:26] <%twistedj3ster> that was weird because I still saw the mouse move
[1:11:31] <nomolomo> great start
[1:11:33] <IntrepidEye> Until I see the ship designs I keep forgetting this is set in the Homeworld universe
[1:11:37] <heartlesshealer> it was fixed and then it went away
[1:11:41] <Jaysky> @illTemperedSeaBass So what you're saying is we should execute literally every single cop? I don't think that'll go well.
[1:11:44] <heartlesshealer> yay
[1:11:47] <nomolomo> now we can seeee
[1:11:53] <+D00msDayDan> @IntrepidEye it's not, the devs just really like homeworld
[1:11:53] <+thegreenbenis> @IntrepidEye Wait for real?
[1:11:56] <heartlesshealer> caution
[1:11:57] <themountaindwarf> is this the new minecraft game

[1:12:12] <heartlesshealer> So Epilepsy warning if you play
[1:12:15] <heartlesshealer> uhh
[1:12:16] <Paciboyy> no you must respect the companies
[1:12:19] <+D00msDayDan> devs for this game made homeworld: deserts of kharak which was formerly hardware: shipbreakers before they got the homeworld license
[1:12:25] <PirateMike_> Pat did you play the OG baldur gates?
[1:12:28] <illTemperedSeaBass> @jaysky You know what I was trying to say. Anyone who punishes others *for defending themselves.
[1:12:41] <illTemperedSeaBass> Typing anything is a pain in the ass on mobile.
[1:13:00] <%Mr_Pylon> Also docsquiddy did some writing for this I believe
[1:13:01] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> it's alien!

[1:13:12] <%darklordfodder> darklordfodder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Pat, excited to see this game, friends that like stuff like Factorio keep recommending it. Also happy to see you enjoy the genre, it's not for everyone, which I discovered after buying 3 different friends Factorio.
[1:13:18] <NoCreditClear> READ THE TOS
[1:13:19] <+queaks> A friend of my dads is a deep sea welder. Crazy job
[1:13:20] <+D00msDayDan> real shipbreakers have played this game and said wow it's just like my job
[1:13:20] <PirateMike_> @illTemperedSeaBass Indeed, specially we big fingered bastards lol
[1:13:22] <%DakotaMacDoodle> undersea welding is terrifying
[1:13:24] <SaltyAzteca> Noooooo Pat, you MIGHT die, or worse...get de-limbed
[1:13:26] <+Opal_Overture> It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
[1:13:27] <%MisterRockett> You meet characters who do this as a job in Expanse. One guy loses his arm harvesting ice from a meteor.
[1:13:29] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt well then please inform me of jobs where you're immortal
[1:13:39] <+Despera__> Very heavy handed world building but also great
[1:13:41] <%maenos2> i saw some video on the dangers of pressure changes underwater with pipelines and that shit is SCARY.
[1:13:44] <+MassConnect> Rebecca chamers!

[1:14:18] <%barrakuta371> network time remaining: 2 DAYS?!
[1:14:22] <%AncelDeLambert> I did, I found it overwrought
[1:14:31] <%Ziegsy> its coming to console apparently. Im happy
[1:14:39] <%AncelDeLambert> in my opinion, this segment is trying too hard
[1:14:39] <illTemperedSeaBass> @piratemike_ I have average-sized hands and it still sucks. I can't imagine fucking with phones with big ham-fists.
[1:14:50] <%AncelDeLambert> mostly with the indemnities page
[1:14:53] <%UltraViolet371> can this game do in five minutes what outer worlds try to do in a whole game?
[1:15:01] <PirateMike_> haha
[1:15:10] <yourliteraldog> Congrats your the right combination of skilled and expendable.
[1:15:14] <%DappercatEsquire> Is this basically as dangerous as underwater welding?
[1:15:15] <%maenos2> @D00msDayDan Yup that's in it.  THere's also several CG examples too of humans in the past who have died in rather...unpleasant ways.
[1:15:21] <+derg0ns> oh my god this world is fucked

[1:21:24] <NoCreditClear> it's the fuckin' best aesthetic
[1:21:25] <%madmanrambler> its fucking bad when the folk song has to include 'when my dad dies may the next guy be lucky'
[1:21:26] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> OH THIS GAME
[1:21:26] <+queaks> Firefly bab
[1:21:30] <%BoomerSqueaker> Oh dude. Those space ships look like the ones from Dune!
[1:21:30] <Paciboyy> this reminds me of the first Memories movie, Magnetic Rose
[1:21:30] <%MuffledEurobeat> yeah, big Expanse energy
[1:21:31] <DaKnightWarrior> yeah
[1:21:31] <RoamV> God damn this cutscene looks pretty
[1:21:33] <%heartlesshealer> ye
[1:21:35] <+Deekman> blue collar scifi
[1:21:37] <%dalmek> something about folk music is very space
[1:21:38] <+Opal_Overture> SPACE TRUCKERS A GOOD ASS AESTHETIC
[1:21:39] <ExpressNode> Pat likes Banjo Kappa
[1:21:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cowboys
[1:21:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Space Coybows
[1:21:46] <+tigerfang86> so just a regular trucker but space
[1:21:46] <winner_92> best space trucker is the woman from that one episode of cowboy bebop
[1:21:48] <+thelonechris> Space truckin~
[1:21:51] <ullyzeez> that warframe song is cool too
[1:21:52] <+gimmickypizza> Haha
[1:21:52] <Dreigun> Cargo Commander is all about that theme
[1:21:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> Heavy Metal Queen from Bebop is super good
[1:21:57] <HeroToxiko> nice
[1:21:59] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I'd be a Space Trucker for sure
[1:22:01] <Paciboyy> thats dope
[1:22:01] <%Chichen> why would my spacetruck have a window like that
[1:22:02] <%AncelDeLambert> ... why does his ship even have a window?
[1:22:02] <%toolofparanoia> LUL
[1:22:04] <%heartlesshealer> sounds about right
[1:22:06] <SaltyAzteca> V.T.!
[1:22:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dallas and Robo on Youtube was pretty good.
[1:22:06] <%vivaldiva> radiation burns only on the forearm
[1:22:07] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> who was this
[1:22:07] <softbirby> Whats only in real trucking
[1:22:07] <+baldur09> this art is very chris foss like
[1:22:07] <BaronVonProlix> @PatStaresAt that shits real, my dad had sunburns on his left arm from driving trucks in calgary
[1:22:07] <worldbrand> oh like the trucker tan but not on your arm
[1:22:08] <yourliteraldog> Also a company required addiction to space speed
[1:22:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> See ya later, Space Cowboy...
[1:22:09] <ZaCrimsonDragon> how long till pat starts playing elite dangerous?
[1:22:09] <%ssjklyco> sup
[1:22:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> That kinda happens with regular ground truckers
[1:22:10] <Djinnazz> Why not just flip it?
[1:22:10] <winner_92> @GalacticaPhanto yeah thats the one!
[1:22:13] <+tigerfang86> WORK BUY PROFIT
[1:22:15] <scrumbotime> Space is where all the folksy banjo music comes from, like a hillbilly azazoth
[1:22:18] <+tigerfang86> CAPITALISM
[1:22:18] <s1rcuit> @GalacticaPhanto I was literally gonna say that
[1:22:20] <%maenos2> kiith somtaaw best kiith
[1:22:21] <Garry_Guyface> cyutter
[1:22:21] <%actual_scum> that's why i love elite dangerous so much
[1:22:23] <AncelDeLambert> windows are an unnecessary expense, he'd work by LADAR
[1:22:23] <Gorgs7> I mean, there's no reason at all to just sit there looking out the front window though
[1:22:25] <rafaelba93> that already happens tho
[1:22:29] <+Frost_Quill> If you're going long distances in space why would you need to be at the helm for that long?
[1:22:30] <+gimmickypizza> Just don't make a side window
[1:22:37] <%brickwall35> omnidirectional-bound and down, loaded up and truckin
[1:22:45] <%AncelDeLambert> hey Weaver, whatup?
[1:22:47] <+baldur09> If anybody likes this kind of art check out the terran trade authority books
[1:22:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sounds like you're already a clone of the guy they hired
[1:22:57] <%actual_scum> weaver fucks for sure
[1:23:00] <+Opal_Overture> @PatStaresAt Lil' quiet
[1:23:03] <s1rcuit> meaning Weaver died multiple times
[1:23:18] <Saltmeisterr> PERFECT
[1:23:19] <%Chichen> better
[1:23:20] <SaltyAzteca> better
[1:23:21] <%blaggablag> Complications implyign Weaver's balls don't fit his suit any more
[1:23:22] <%Ynkubus_> @baldur09 Chris Foss art rules
[1:23:22] <Garry_Guyface> good
[1:23:23] <%BoomerSqueaker> it's better SourPls
[1:23:24] <%AncelDeLambert> psaUp
[1:23:26] <$valkuma> how many tips do you want for this game cause theres some whacky shit
[1:23:26] <NoCreditClear> it won't feel so quiet when shit is exploding
[1:23:27] <+ChaosAethr> BIG Question, Whats the Debt of this character?
[1:23:28] <ammobasket> Hanging your arm out the space-window
[1:23:29] <+Frost_Quill> better
[1:23:30] <%AncelDeLambert> psaUp psaUp
[1:23:31] <%vivaldiva> psaUp
[1:23:39] <%AncelDeLambert> everyone thumb up, good job Cutter!
[1:23:45] <%actual_scum> space banjo is something i didn't know i needed
[1:23:46] <NitronStreams> Turn up the banjo
[1:23:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> ass end?
[1:23:51] <%Mr_Pylon> I love refering to planet folks as worms
[1:23:51] <%AncelDeLambert> psaUp way to go, Cutter
[1:23:51] <%ssjklyco> Do a berrel roll
[1:23:56] <SolidScorpion> the yaw of this lad
[1:23:58] <%Apathiae> @PatStaresAt control is also break
[1:24:02] <%Kangumosa> Has everyone cracked pat's code he posted on twitter yet?
[1:24:10] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> this is gonna give me motion sickness
[1:24:10] <%blaggablag> Oh pat knows about them rolls allright
[1:24:12] <%AncelDeLambert> it took so long for them to put in control remapping
[1:24:13] <s1rcuit> I don't think Woolie could handle it
[1:24:15] <+D00msDayDan> all the tools are one handed so your left hand is always free to give the thumbs up
[1:24:17] <ScreamLord> This game would be vomit inducing in VR
[1:24:22] <+Opal_Overture> @ChaosAethr I think the starting debt is arouuuuund.... 1e^20?
[1:24:27] <%W1nterTitan> W1nterTitan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 19 month streak! Friendship ended with Destiny 2. FFXIV is now my new best friend. Hello, fellow Roegadyn.
[1:24:28] <%actual_scum> i wouldn't be able to play this
[1:24:31] <Psyramics> @Kangumosa yes, his dog stepped on the keypad
[1:24:33] <%actual_scum> full 3-d control? no thanks
[1:24:52] <%AncelDeLambert> POW
[1:24:58] <%AncelDeLambert> get them cash MONEY
[1:25:07] <TheFramedWarlock> Real disorientation hours
[1:25:10] <scrumbotime> I like how you can cut most things, and other things you can just yank real hard to snap them off
[1:25:11] <%Chichen> KKona yeehaw
[1:25:15] <+okingjrr> Woolie would die playing this
[1:25:16] <%AncelDeLambert> apparently they MASSIVELY reworked the barge, thank fuck
[1:25:19] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[1:25:22] <$valkuma> i have my speedrun of the Very Hard Heavy Cargo Gecko down pretty tight i get like 12 mill each time now
[1:25:28] <DrkJP520> giddy up
[1:25:28] <+NameInsertable> Careful with that reel, you can and will kill yourself with it
[1:25:31] <%actual_scum> how long until pat develops a workin' man's accent unironically?
[1:25:32] <Psyramics> he's kidding, it takes 500 antennae a day just to break even
[1:25:32] <%AncelDeLambert> ye, and I must insist, haw
[1:25:33] <TheFramedWarlock> This seems like a pretty boring game if it's literally just cutting procedurally generated ships over and over again
[1:25:34] <%Frost_Quill> "A billion wouldn't be NEARLY enough honhonhon."
[1:25:35] <+Bailey__gaming> I tell you what that space boy aint right
[1:25:36] <%madmanrambler> 'I'm kidding of course' doesn't say if he's over or underexaggerating
[1:25:43] <+Opal_Overture> @AncelDeLambert Made it deeper and pulled it way closer. Yeah.
[1:25:44] <PinoProxie> pat becoming space plague
[1:25:50] <yourliteraldog> How long would it take for the space workers to realize they can chuck shit at earth.
[1:25:52] <$valkuma> TheFramedWarlock you would think so but its honestly really fun
[1:25:56] <+Opal_Overture> @madmanrambler Under.
[1:25:58] <+D00msDayDan> did they add demo charges to the tutorial? i haven't played since they were added and i'm not sure how you would actually use them
[1:26:00] <NoCreditClear> New barge is pretty baller
[1:26:12] <%sweetestbeefs> are you manually doing the thumbs up?
[1:26:14] <$valkuma> @NoCreditClear you mean the gecko?
[1:26:16] <%JoshManVGH> oooooh ok, so space cutting without creepy dead goo cults.
[1:26:27] <yourliteraldog> Better wages or kinetic strikes
[1:26:29] <+D00msDayDan> @sweetestbeefs thumbs up is for every completed goal
[1:26:47] <%AncelDeLambert> @JoshManVGH hahaha. Haaaahahahaha. AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!
[1:26:49] <NoCreditClear> @valkuma No, I mean the barge you toss shit into
[1:26:59] <$valkuma> oh lol
[1:27:07] <+panlakes> is this basically the outer wilds jetpack cave tutorial as a full game
[1:27:10] <%Kangumosa> Why is Pat speaking like Paige
[1:27:16] <%JoshManVGH> @anceldelambert ... I'm feeling a concern
[1:27:21] <DaKnightWarrior> I like Pat's cowboy voice lol
[1:27:23] <SaltyAzteca> @JoshManVGH But I liked the creepy goo death cults. Even came with violins
[1:27:24] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you don't have to grapple it to push it
[1:27:28] <$valkuma> You can Push stuff in the direction you are pointing even if the object is not in front of you @PatStaresAt
[1:27:29] <DrkJP520> You're just droppin' shit down to earth?
[1:27:30] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> shouldn't it just accelerate towards the target?
[1:27:33] <%UltraViolet371> the sound design is great, like it's just the vibrations you getting from inside your suit
[1:27:35] <%AncelDeLambert> @JoshManVGH we'll get to Ghostships later
[1:27:39] <+D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt you can hold the push button to charge a stronger push, idk if it's disabled in the tutorial tho
[1:27:40] <%Foodfordagods> well im in que for a ps5
[1:27:44] <%maybefalco> man look at that DEBR
[1:27:44] <%Jekado> space yee hawww
[1:27:46] <Rionxgarland> dats a lot of debt
[1:27:47] <NoCreditClear> You'v ebasically beat the whole game
[1:27:47] <%sweetestbeefs> YEE HAW!
[1:27:49] <%Pukenasty> yee haw
[1:27:51] <%BoomerSqueaker> KKona
[1:27:51] <jamsbybetty> this game looks rad as shit
[1:27:52] <%toolofparanoia> Yo we Issac Clarke but without the PTSD from space rocks and recombinant zombies
[1:27:54] <%Jekado> @D00msDayDan not unlocked yet i think
[1:27:54] <$valkuma> @D00msDayDan you have to unlock that
[1:27:55] <winner_92> this fuckin thumbs up animation is so funny to me
[1:28:02] <+Opal_Overture> @Foodfordagods God speed.
[1:28:07] <Hellarussian> that really butters my biscuits
[1:28:08] <+Deekman> I could listen to the space cowboy all day
[1:28:15] <%sweetestbeefs> "MOSEY"
[1:28:15] <%AncelDeLambert> aaaaaand splat
[1:28:21] <ScreamLord> 2 Pro Tips from someone that only played 10 minutes of this game: The Push has WAY more range than it looks, and you don't have to grapple an item before you push it
[1:28:34] <%sweetestbeefs> wever seems like a cool grandpa
[1:28:35] <%Fien111> Sleeping in open space would be....horrifying....and yet I wanna do it
[1:28:38] <+thegreenbenis> They are less evil than most real corporations. @PatStaresAt
[1:28:39] <+ryderbootz> look, you can see the Montreal desert from up here
[1:28:40] <+Deekman> why is the southern drawl such a fun accent
[1:28:43] <$valkuma> I paid off my debt LUL
[1:28:46] <DaKnightWarrior> What in space tarnation!
[1:28:47] <%BoomerSqueaker> The space ship designs are totally ripped from Jodorowsky's Dune LUL
[1:28:47] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Hey that kinda talk is against the Term of service Pat
[1:28:47] <CrimsonFox777> LESS THAN $1BILLION DEBT PogChamp
[1:28:49] <winner_92> only 999 million in debt PogChamp
[1:28:49] <+D00msDayDan> get that space paper
[1:28:51] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i'm sorry why do you have 1 billion in debt?
[1:28:52] <SaltyAzteca> Sheesh, what a debt
[1:28:57] <%brickwall35> man how did you get that much debt
[1:28:57] <Rionxgarland> what is this space tom nook
[1:29:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt your hand, whatever button that's on, is your best friend. It's free, it attaches you to objects and lets you move without jets, and keeps you from face-planting. And I don't think the tutorial explains it.
[1:29:02] <%sweetestbeefs> jeez, is this jerma?
[1:29:09] <scrumbotime> I like that "we are going to make the room into a real room later in updates"
[1:29:17] <%heartlesshealer> Sometime ™
[1:29:18] <%Mr_Pylon> Just 1 Billion in debt for the privillage of having the job itself!
[1:29:26] <yourliteraldog> DRM for tools
[1:29:27] <s1rcuit> @SaltyAzteca that's future-space-America for you
[1:29:44] <$RealThiele> John deere has DRM tractors so yea
[1:29:44] <ScreamLord> And yet your still making a bigger dent in your debt than most collage graduates do their loans
[1:29:54] <%Frost_Quill> bork
[1:29:56] <SaltyAzteca> @s1rcuit LUL
[1:29:56] <ToneBacas> if the agency owns your DNA and can just produce clones of you, why not spawn a bunch of 'you' to get the job done faster?
[1:29:56] <NitronStreams> that reminds me of the game where youre working off years of jail time and you start with like a billion years or something
[1:29:58] <scrumbotime> Imagine how much money you'll have when you don't have a billion dollars in debt! (implodes from sarcasm)
[1:30:16] <%Kangumosa> Pat's only now in 3+56.12563 debt
[1:30:34] <$realm_forge> Is the prequel to Jedi fallen order?
[1:30:36] <%blaggablag> The rewards program was oxygen. Congratulations worker!
[1:30:41] <%AncelDeLambert> psaUp
[1:30:42] <+D00msDayDan> @ToneBacas clones are probably cheaper than the equipment
[1:30:47] <s1rcuit> @ToneBacas the same reason for literally every thing corps do: profit/costs
[1:30:57] <+Opal_Overture> @D00msDayDan Yep!
[1:31:02] <%blaggablag> Revengeance that shit up
[1:31:03] <%sweetestbeefs> DA WHOLE BUFFALO
[1:31:10] <%Dunmarkh> just like the space native americans did
[1:31:31] <%Frost_Quill> "I don't rightly know what a buffalo is, they've been extinct for over a century..."
[1:31:42] <+Deekman> that's a mighty fun cut right there
[1:31:46] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, it did
[1:31:52] <+NameInsertable> @PatStaresAt you can use num keys to change tools as well
[1:32:03] <ThDark> I have put so many hours into this game already, it just clicks something in my brain
[1:32:04] <%AncelDeLambert> can't wait until tethers
[1:32:08] <NoCreditClear> The force push move is kino
[1:32:20] <+Deekman> this is cool but I think I like satisfactory more. I think building and having something at t the end is more rewarding than cleaning your plate
[1:32:22] <%sweetestbeefs> this seems like a nice autopilot game
[1:32:22] <$valkuma> wait till you see the upgraded one
[1:32:33] <$realm_forge> This is a fascinating glimpse into the dead end life of my great great great grandchild
[1:32:34] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt when you highlight a part it shows the mass of the individual part and the mass of the all the parts it's connected to
[1:33:09] <%sweetestbeefs> WOAH
[1:33:09] <%Kangumosa> reminds me of the dead space cutter
[1:33:10] <NoCreditClear> brrrrt
[1:33:14] <%Jekado> yeee cutting is fun
[1:33:16] <%Treuan> God I love that cutting tool
[1:33:20] <%sweetestbeefs> that looks cool as shit
[1:33:20] <tattleworm> i remember back when i used to do clean cuts like this, only ugly triangles now, gotta do it fast
[1:33:26] <SaltyAzteca> them twangin chords be like Kreygasm
[1:33:31] <%Das_Bass> Das_Bass subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:33:38] <$realm_forge> AIM FOR THE LIMBS
[1:33:40] <AdmiralButtloaf> Is this a deadspace spinoff
[1:33:41] <%ssjklyco> Pats learning to be a dead space engineer.
[1:33:41] <xbb1024> dead space!
[1:33:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Is this just Dead Space if the zombie shit never happened?
[1:33:49] <%asgard147> I just got here, is this game about salvaging space ships and space junk? limesThink
[1:33:49] <%AncelDeLambert> it's nutty learning that the point laser is your best friend for this detail work
[1:33:51] <%Kangumosa> the sound effects are brilliant
[1:33:55] <%brickwall35> LUL
[1:33:56] <+LordSDB> LUL
[1:33:56] <PinoProxie> LUL
[1:33:58] <%sweetestbeefs> NICE ONE
[1:33:58] <$RealThiele> b o n k
[1:33:59] <NoCreditClear> LUL
[1:33:59] <%Treuan> Yeah that happens
[1:34:01] <dan_g_v> did he hit himself?
[1:34:03] <Enishi1027> bonk
[1:34:10] <SaltyAzteca> UHHH, CRACK
[1:34:12] <%AncelDeLambert> he smacked himself, yeah
[1:34:12] <NitronStreams> Head trauma is all just part of the job
[1:34:15] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat's going to get cloned in training
[1:34:18] <Gorgs7> is this a secret Dead Space tie in? Are you gonna get handed the Marker to disassemble?
[1:34:19] <%Kangumosa> @XeroSigmaPrime Alive Space
[1:34:20] <NoCreditClear> gotta gentle tap that reel in button lol
[1:34:20] <+thegreenbenis> You bonked yourr radio
[1:34:23] <CrimsonFox777> Now we have to file an accident report for the suit's damage!
[1:34:25] <%AncelDeLambert> grab them cut points
[1:34:34] <yourliteraldog> Sir Issac Newton is deadliest man in space
[1:34:35] <%Kangumosa> It's a dead space prequel: Alive Space
[1:34:37] <+VakyrieProfiling> I know it's not even the same universe, but I wish you could do Homeworld ships in this, they got the rights, I think
[1:34:52] <NoCreditClear> Hardly anything that goes into the Furnace is worth a damn,
[1:34:54] <%AncelDeLambert> those tiny blocks so aren't worth the trouble to seperate
[1:34:56] <$valkuma> @PatStaresAt You can tell if something is going to cut based on the reticle color and if dots go down it. the bottom plates are safe
[1:34:58] <+Freakin_Wolfy> shouldn't it be Black Collar?
[1:34:59] <%Invlux> It's a living
[1:35:01] <+mr_drucifer> It took all of like 30 minutes for me to be absolutely hooked by this shit lol
[1:35:02] <%sweetestbeefs> it's honest work
[1:35:05] <%Valdorick> "Its a living" *musical sting*
[1:35:05] <%Rumbutt> Is it better than retail tho?
[1:35:05] <+Midashu> got a touch of that space lung
[1:35:11] <%blaggablag> Beats the surface life
[1:35:18] <%Broand> The game was supposed to originally be set in the homeworld universe but the rights were fecked
[1:35:24] <$RealThiele> space bones
[1:35:30] <%Frost_Quill> Depending on how much a billion credits even is this might be good pay.
[1:35:40] <aiutare47> Look at that desert earth
[1:36:03] <blaggablag> haha, florida under water down there
[1:36:04] <+VakyrieProfiling> ah, shame....
[1:36:05] <%blaggablag> get fucked
[1:36:11] <TheFramedWarlock> Space banjo is surprisingly chill
[1:36:12] <%AncelDeLambert> now throw the whole of the rest in the furnace, fuck the little blocks, man
[1:36:18] <%AncelDeLambert> just CHUCK it
[1:36:18] <%DianaTheAscian> is this a scrapping game?
[1:36:26] <$valkuma> you will never cut nanocarbon
[1:36:27] <%DukeMoose> DukeMoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Gotta use the whole Buffalo Pat, every. single. piece.
[1:36:29] <aiutare47> yep
[1:36:30] <TheFramedWarlock> This game reminds me a lot of Viscera Cleanup Detail though
[1:36:30] <+okingjrr> It's too heavy
[1:36:31] <%Broand> toss it into the furnaaaace
[1:36:32] <$realm_forge> Does this game have pvp?
[1:36:32] <Psyramics> yes
[1:36:37] <NoCreditClear> yeet the whole thing into the furnace
[1:36:40] <%vivaldiva> curse you newton
[1:36:41] <%Treuan> Almost threw himself into the furnace
[1:36:42] <$RealThiele> physics
[1:36:44] <SaltyAzteca> Heavier things push YOU, right
[1:36:45] <%Kangumosa> Pat must become the strong
[1:36:46] <%sweetestbeefs> backblast yeah
[1:36:46] <+D00msDayDan> almost launched right into the other processor
[1:36:50] <yourliteraldog> Newton thinks you a bitch
[1:36:57] <%AncelDeLambert> Furnace, Pat, the aluminum is worth more than the nanocarbon at this volume
[1:36:59] <+thegreenbenis> Cut the bars.
[1:37:00] <$valkuma> for structures "Furnace" is cuttable "Processor" is not
[1:37:09] <+D00msDayDan> sir issac newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space
[1:37:22] <%Frost_Quill> Oh it's not just the specific glowy points.
[1:37:27] <+thegreenbenis> FURNACE @PatStaresAt
[1:37:27] <$valkuma> When you grapple something it will show a blue effect on it if its light enough.
[1:37:27] <%Kangumosa> he cut the wrong thing hehe
[1:37:27] <$RealThiele> thicc
[1:37:38] <leole11> too heavy
[1:37:55] <%walternatorz> when do the space necromorphs pop out?
[1:37:56] <gslayer14> cheeky metal
[1:37:58] <%machshop> machshop subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! good shit cuuuutter
[1:37:58] <+thegreenbenis> Worth more in the furnace.
[1:38:01] <%JoshManVGH> @d00msdaydan Man, I can't wait to play Mass Effect again.
[1:38:04] <LVL1_Scumbag> Like a big space table
[1:38:04] <ScreamLord> Lots of people are always dissing on garbage men, construction workers, and other blue collar jobs. "Better get a good education or you'll be one of those!" But the trash man probably makes WAY more money than YOU do professor!
[1:38:09] <%ssjklyco> Pats fired
[1:38:17] <%Treuan> It's a matter of weight x value
[1:38:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt volume
[1:38:18] <$valkuma> Theres more Furnace on it than Processor
[1:38:21] <%Fien111> I'm trying to pay off my space debt but my salvage is too dummy thicc and it's pushing me back
[1:38:23] <%AncelDeLambert> there's more aluminum
[1:38:24] <Psyramics> way more Furnace mass
[1:38:24] <+ianabstract> it yells at you to revisit your training
[1:38:27] <+NameInsertable> @PatStaresAt More volume
[1:38:35] <RoamV> A higher % of the item belongs in the furnace it seems
[1:38:38] <Manwad> Every time you throw something in, on the side it'll say the worth of what you just chucked in
[1:38:39] <leole11> the weight
[1:38:40] <yourliteraldog> diffrent parts i guess
[1:38:42] <%sweetestbeefs> oh man this music
[1:38:45] <tattleworm> i generally just shove it in the processor even if it's part furnace
[1:38:48] <%Broand> it says deposit salvage on where it's more valuable
[1:38:48] <%machshop> all of it
[1:38:49] <%Valdorick> The whole hog
[1:38:49] <NoCreditClear> You gotta feel it out. aluminum panels are almost worthless, but there's so little nano on there it's more worth it
[1:38:50] <%AncelDeLambert> yayyyyyy
[1:38:50] <+SlashHabit> man this music is really good
[1:38:51] <+NameInsertable> Dead
[1:38:54] <$valkuma> The furnace has the grav pull of 1000 suns.
[1:38:56] <gslayer14> space table
[1:38:57] <%AncelDeLambert> head on back to your home, Cutter
[1:39:01] <+D00msDayDan> i love chucking a giant congruent chunk of ship frame into the furnace and watching the framerate just DIE
[1:39:04] <+ianabstract> oo you almost got crisped
[1:39:05] <%Treuan> That buffalo never stood a chance
[1:39:06] <CrimsonFox777> @ScreamLord Not just that, but if we didn't have them, society would run into some problems.
[1:39:09] <%twistedj3ster> not a single unused buffalo
[1:39:11] <$RealThiele> this music is like the better parts of borderlands and firefly
[1:39:12] <+NameInsertable> @PatStaresAt You really don't want to get close to the furnace
[1:39:14] <NoCreditClear> demon furnace swallowing my nano
[1:39:14] <$realm_forge> Does this game also make you fill out tax and or redundant resume forms?
[1:39:16] <%BudaBryan> BudaBryan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:39:19] <%Kangumosa> Wake up, cutter, we've a world to salvage
[1:39:24] <%blaggablag> Cut level is how powerful the tool you need to cut, value is determined by part volume when processing material
[1:39:41] <%AncelDeLambert> weapon?
[1:39:44] <RoamV> Select Tool Menu
[1:39:45] <%sweetestbeefs> select tool menu?
[1:39:47] <+okingjrr> Select Tool Menu
[1:39:51] <ScreamLord> @CrimsonFox777 Truth
[1:39:59] <%JoshManVGH> @screamlord Technical Schools don't make as much money so they push people to shoot for Ivy League like it's some beall end metric of success.
[1:40:03] <+impressionistcowboy> I'm pretty sure pat you can cut off parts to be processed vs parts to be furnaced
[1:40:14] <+impressionistcowboy> with the line tool
[1:40:14] <$RealThiele> much more efficient
[1:40:17] <%JoshManVGH> *be all end all metric
[1:40:20] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt you don't even need the radial menu, you can switch between cutter types using the tool number
[1:40:21] <+Proxzo> Time is a factor
[1:40:26] <RoamV> If you wanna be nitty gritty with it
[1:40:28] <Giztech> surprised your not using a controller
[1:40:31] <%sweetestbeefs> i mean the r button isnt a bad button to put it on either
[1:40:43] <%BoomerSqueaker> This game is like a love letter to Alien lol
[1:40:46] <%Kangumosa> R is for reload
[1:40:51] <+Proxzo> you can spend time cutting off the little bits, but sometimes it's just more efficient to junk the whole piece.
[1:41:15] <+Proxzo> If you care about time.
[1:41:20] <%heartlesshealer> take the key off of the other default
[1:41:20] <%W1nterTitan> you just set it up to the tool menu
[1:41:24] <+D00msDayDan> 5 is the flashlight i think?
[1:41:25] <%JoshManVGH> "your mom" gottem
[1:41:26] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Kangumosa F is for "For reload"
[1:41:38] <+midnightlace6> pokemoHug
[1:41:43] <%ospreyworks> Afternoon!
[1:41:48] <%heartlesshealer> pat
[1:41:55] <%heartlesshealer> you're just zooming through menus
[1:41:57] <$RealThiele> smooth brain access
[1:42:02] <+okingjrr> rebinding is probably fine
[1:42:09] <%Kangumosa> @Emperor_Machinus No F is for Pay Respects
[1:42:30] <%AncelDeLambert> wait until he finds out about grabbing things with his hands
[1:42:39] <$RealThiele> 200k ok 1 billion isnt shit
[1:42:44] <DaKnightWarrior> Level up.
[1:42:46] <Djinnazz> current dept 100 mill??
[1:42:56] <%heartlesshealer> Sometimes computers see button 4 and 5 as combinations of other keys. Fucked me up in Generation Zero after I'd already gotten used to using button 4 to crouch
[1:43:00] <%AncelDeLambert> 100 BILL
[1:43:01] <%Valdorick> Its euth- oh no, upgrades
[1:43:06] <%AncelDeLambert> TETHER GOOD
[1:43:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Kangumosa Why not both? F = "For reload to pay respects"
[1:43:18] <$RealThiele> bolas
[1:43:28] <%Chichen> tethers are my friends :)
[1:43:39] <%Kangumosa> Oh no
[1:43:50] <leole11> tether are GOODS
[1:43:54] <gslayer14> queen of algebra
[1:43:56] <%sweetestbeefs> boutta blow up
[1:44:04] <Garry_Guyface> hahahahaah
[1:44:08] <%sweetestbeefs> HUMBLE
[1:44:09] <T_Sasquatch> Hmm
[1:44:12] <heartlesshealer> god
[1:44:14] <+corrosivePaladin> taterLUL
[1:44:14] <Griffin1171> ol' musky
[1:44:17] <yourliteraldog> Lol Apartheid
[1:44:18] <%Ynkubus_> a bunch of people
[1:44:19] <%blaggablag> THE HUMBLEST
[1:44:20] <%MidnightBurst12> hmmmm
[1:44:21] <%AncelDeLambert> mmmmm, mackerel
[1:44:23] <%kyh9> Oh Elon
[1:44:24] <$RealThiele> scummo in spaaaaace
[1:44:30] <%toolofparanoia> His name was Telon Husk
[1:44:32] <leole11> LMAO
[1:44:41] <%sweetestbeefs> i'm out of the loop, is it a bezos joke?
[1:44:46] <%sweetestbeefs> oh waut nvm
[1:44:47] <%AncelDeLambert> tethers cost cash, tho, so be careful
[1:44:51] <%Kangumosa> Pat's using the Hamon energy
[1:44:53] <T_Sasquatch> Im sure elon musk is pretty smart but he gets wayyy too much shit attributed to him
[1:45:01] <+D00msDayDan> tethers are best girl
[1:45:06] <%AncelDeLambert> aaaaand he oopsed it
[1:45:15] <NoCreditClear> tether cost is negligible
[1:45:17] <%blaggablag> the fuck is he doing
[1:45:18] <%Broand> you can tether to the hologram thing
[1:45:25] <+D00msDayDan> tethers can attach straight to the barge, don't need to stick them to the frame
[1:45:28] <+ianabstract> you can tether right to the green field
[1:45:32] <%AncelDeLambert> might wanna cancel those tethers
[1:45:37] <%blaggablag> Just tether them down to the barge ya dingus
[1:45:39] <%BoomerSqueaker> Getting flashback to that ghostbusters game on the 360 lol
[1:45:41] <TrollKing96> Isn't Elon from South Africa?
[1:45:46] <+okingjrr> 4K has some issues
[1:45:50] <%toolofparanoia> Now you're working with tethers
[1:45:51] <%AncelDeLambert> thank fuck they fixed the airlocks
[1:45:53] <$RealThiele> fart gassed
[1:45:53] <NitronStreams> I dont know why but Weaver is giving me big Higgs vibes. I feel like hes gonna start talking about Dooms any second now.
[1:46:00] <+PenmanLupine> it says OOHHHH
[1:46:16] <%Dunmarkh> @TrollKing96 yeah, he's a blood diamond baby
[1:46:19] <leole11> he says holy shit, and he hasn't seen a giant javelin yet!!
[1:46:25] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> T
[1:46:31] <%Ranryu692> @TrollKing96 emeralds, actually
[1:46:38] <sweetestbeefs> toggle scanner?
[1:46:45] <+Jekado> thats the scanner
[1:46:45] <RoamV> It doesn't seem to last forever
[1:46:49] <NoCreditClear> try scroll wheel to cycle scanner types?
[1:46:49] <+okingjrr> uh oh
[1:46:50] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking hell processing the biggest ships is such a chore. I wish it was easier to peel the bastards
[1:46:51] <+NameInsertable> That is the scanner
[1:46:53] <%SpontaneousC> bug, if you have the scanner open when this part of the tutorial starts it wont continue
[1:46:55] <%blaggablag> Try using the wheel to change scanner modes
[1:46:55] <Garry_Guyface> You need the scanner off to interact with things
[1:46:57] <tattleworm> yeah, they're just saying the green bars are pressured areas
[1:46:57] <%SpontaneousC> its been a bug since launch
[1:47:00] <%furiousfurioso> uh oh
[1:47:07] <+okingjrr> Quit out to the main menu and retry
[1:47:13] <+ianabstract> early accessed
[1:47:14] <+okingjrr> that's a bug
[1:47:17] <LSether> I wonder if you broke it because you were already in scan mode when he asked.
[1:47:20] <%AncelDeLambert> e to interact
[1:47:22] <Garry_Guyface> huh
[1:47:25] <$RealThiele> F
[1:47:27] <leole11> they're there, they're just really tiny
[1:47:30] <%sweetestbeefs> uh oh
[1:47:31] <%blaggablag> ah, it might have fucked the tutorial cause you where in scanner mode before the prompt came up
[1:47:34] <%SpontaneousC> I cant believe they still havent fixed this stupid bug
[1:47:39] <+SlashHabit> did the game break because you had the scanner on before the objective?
[1:47:41] <%Kangumosa> Ah yes the endboss - airlock
[1:47:50] <%Mr_Pylon> Sometimes in the tutorial if you sequence break early into even the simplest things it breaks
[1:47:58] <%madmanrambler> so early impressions?
[1:48:01] <+okingjrr> @SlashHabit could be
[1:48:07] <%blaggablag> Fortunately it's pretty quick load
[1:48:08] <%moonmintparadise> Hey Pat, good to see you.  Are you having fun :) ?
[1:48:15] <NitronStreams> no more speedrunning
[1:48:15] <Ipsenscastle> oh that Lynx logo is snazzy
[1:48:29] <%blaggablag> Tether straight down to the hologram tho
[1:48:37] <%Kangumosa> psaHoldon
[1:48:41] <LSether> Once you are on your own, you can go crazy. But the tutorial is a bit specific.
[1:48:42] <%blaggablag> atta boy
[1:48:52] <%blastyoboots> we Just Cause now
[1:48:58] <+Proxzo> Your tethers are limited though. you have ammo
[1:49:15] <%JoshManVGH> use 15. on everything. warp speed delivery
[1:49:19] <MrPandastic> Tethers are fantastic. Especially once you learn how to daisy chain them.
[1:49:19] <$RealThiele> this UI is busy
[1:49:34] <+okingjrr> fuck
[1:49:47] <%G_Thunders> So is there a point where this becomes a survival game or something? Or is just a straight-forward simulator
[1:49:49] <iosephe> oh no
[1:49:49] <%heartlesshealer> enjoy vision
[1:49:49] <%Broand> the heck
[1:49:51] <Abd0022> is it me or is the game lagging?
[1:49:52] <%Kangumosa> Pat Stares At: Scanner
[1:49:59] <%sweetestbeefs> is this just fucked?
[1:50:00] <+Javaa01> Can you depressurize the ship?
[1:50:00] <%JoshManVGH> Tether yourself, tether your friend, tethers ARE your friend so tether your tethers
[1:50:01] <+impressionistcowboy> pat why don't you just start cutting
[1:50:14] <+impressionistcowboy> i think cutting right now would be great
[1:50:16] <+ChaosAethr> he cant
[1:50:18] <+okingjrr> Nah the game is buggy in the tutorial
[1:50:18] <LSether> Leave it to pat to just break the game instantly in a way i have never seen before. lol
[1:50:18] <Rionxgarland> cuts are locked imp
[1:50:20] <%sweetestbeefs> psaHoldon
[1:50:20] <RoamV> Seems we've encounter a bug
[1:50:20] <%AncelDeLambert> @impressionistcowboy cuz the ship'll explode
[1:50:22] <%ClericOfSparda> Cutter disabled? lame
[1:50:24] <%SpontaneousC> So. Nobody is going to like this but when I had this bug? the only way I was able to fix it was by deleting the save and starting a new career
[1:50:29] <%heartlesshealer> scroll wheel
[1:50:34] <yourliteraldog> cutter is disabled
[1:50:40] <+impressionistcowboy> but it will be fun!
[1:50:41] <%Chichen> oh.
[1:50:42] <%JoshManVGH> Oof
[1:50:42] <%BoxNavy> uh ohhh
[1:50:43] <RoamV> Oof
[1:50:43] <+impressionistcowboy> come on
[1:50:46] <%AncelDeLambert> can you interact with the airlock panel?
[1:50:47] <+impressionistcowboy> pressure is your friend
[1:50:51] <+impressionistcowboy> oh fug
[1:50:53] <%SpontaneousC> That was at launch mind you, but if the same bug's still here the same fix might still be the only way
[1:50:54] <+Deekman> game over
[1:50:55] <%brickwall35> Great game
[1:50:55] <+impressionistcowboy> that sucks
[1:50:55] <Ipsenscastle> fuck this then
[1:50:56] <%sweetestbeefs> i mean, we're still pretty early in the game?
[1:50:56] <Garry_Guyface> Pat I am so sorry this is happening but I expected as much jank with you streaming.
[1:50:57] <Valdorick> You got hit by a case of the Early Accesses
[1:50:58] <%walternatorz> Just like my time in College
[1:50:58] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> Refund time
[1:50:58] <T_Sasquatch> :)
[1:50:59] <%Buzzard42> you're not that far in so it's k
[1:50:59] <Giztech> try remapping the button
[1:50:59] <%vivaldiva> early access!
[1:51:00] <NoCreditClear> can you try just ending the shift by going to the hab?
[1:51:00] <Scorchfield> scroll wheel doesn't do anything?
[1:51:00] <%The_Protagonist> destroy it all
[1:51:00] <SuperUltraWolfHammer> the tutorial is super buggy tbh
[1:51:02] <%sweetestbeefs> wont be that bad of a reset
[1:51:05] <%ClericOfSparda> the downsides of early access
[1:51:06] <gslayer14> that's pretty cringe hardbreaker shipspace
[1:51:07] <RoamV> Early access jank
[1:51:11] <T_Sasquatch> It's REFUND TIME
[1:51:12] <%The_Protagonist> kill them all, peter
[1:51:15] <%heartlesshealer> this is probably why the new update will fuck with saves
[1:51:16] <%AncelDeLambert> the curse of Early Access
[1:51:17] <%Jekado> bummer i have fun with this game but yeah this bug can be a deal breaker
[1:51:23] <%AncelDeLambert> no E to interact, huh?
[1:51:23] <%blaggablag> Man that's a shame this game is stellar otherwise
[1:51:24] <yourliteraldog> Early Access was a mistake
[1:51:27] <Scorchfield> i never had this kind of issue with the tutorial, sad
[1:51:28] <%G_Thunders> Throw yourself in the furnace
[1:51:30] <%sweetestbeefs> pretty cringe partner
[1:51:30] <+impressionistcowboy> welp
[1:51:30] <gslayer14> kill self on enviroment maybe? might reset it
[1:51:37] <%JoshManVGH> This will be super cool when it let's you learn how to play
[1:51:39] <%sweetestbeefs> ONE MORE TIME!
[1:51:42] <leole11> cut the doot?
[1:51:47] <DaKnightWarrior> One more once
[1:51:54] <%JoshManVGH> Time Warp!
[1:51:58] <+Sternold123> why does the scan mode look like an 80s hacker sequence
[1:52:02] <+Katohearts> Could skip tutorial, if you get desperate
[1:52:03] <%Emperor_Machinus> I fixed it by changing ships
[1:52:04] <%sweetestbeefs> yeah, that;s shitty
[1:52:04] <%toolofparanoia> GIVE IT THE OLE COLLEGE TRY
[1:52:08] <Giztech> if it happen just make something explode :D
[1:52:10] <%ssjklyco> Impression Breaker
[1:52:14] <%Dunmarkh> should have played factorio
[1:52:25] <%SpontaneousC> I love this game but the game breaking bugs that show up so early and havent been fixed yet are ridiculous
[1:52:31] <+okingjrr> Try setting the resolution to 1080p, 4K wasn't tested thoroughly
[1:52:37] <%sweetestbeefs> seems like after the tutorial it's fine
[1:52:41] <%blaggablag> It's bizarre tho, I can't say I found a bug like this in a hundred hours of play. I've found crashes on heavy stress, but nothing like a sequence lock
[1:52:44] <yourliteraldog> Dose meal plan effect anything in game?
[1:52:55] <%AncelDeLambert> oh man this is gonna get FUN if he has to skip the tutorial
[1:52:58] <heartlesshealer> ????
[1:53:02] <mechengineers> yeah never found a bug like that
[1:53:04] <+Opal_Overture> @yourliteraldog Not yet
[1:53:08] <+Sternold123> didnt change the settings
[1:53:10] <+SlashHabit> flip the image 90 degrees to
[1:53:12] <Garry_Guyface> speedrun
[1:53:22] <%SpontaneousC> You can rush the first ship since they dont lock out any of your tools during this one
[1:53:28] <%DiscoMatador> wtf
[1:53:40] <+PenmanLupine> plug your tv out then plug it back in
[1:53:50] <%Mr_Pylon> I got stuck on a tutorial bug and getting my dude killed finished a prompt for me once, have no idea if it would still work.
[1:53:54] <+D00msDayDan> try plugging your controller into the second port
[1:53:56] <%DiscoMatador> Thats crazy
[1:53:59] <%Jekado> yeah when i play this game i have the INKY VOID glitch that eats all the graphics from time to time
[1:54:01] <yourliteraldog> Press B to blast through it
[1:54:06] <$RealThiele> LUL
[1:54:07] <+Sternold123> blow on the Steam Installer
[1:54:10] <%Kangumosa> Refundo Timeo
[1:54:11] <Garry_Guyface> oh boy
[1:54:13] <%Jekado> Hey if you want to play something else i can recommend LOOP HERO
[1:54:16] <%SpontaneousC> did. the bug get worse.
[1:54:19] <Scorchfield> i wonder if it got worse since i started, i got the game months ago an didn't encounter issues with the tutorial
[1:54:20] <%aishman> What happened? AGAIN?
[1:54:22] <%SpontaneousC> is thats whats happening here
[1:54:22] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun uyuyuyuTokichan ?
[1:54:23] <%TheWinged7> TheWinged7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months, currently on a 40 month streak! G'Day Pat, looks like i joined in time for the goblins to start
[1:54:23] <%Valdorick> Fuck'n oof
[1:54:25] <+thegreenbenis> How?
[1:54:26] <solus_is_watching> what is the issue?
[1:54:34] <+snurtlord> fly into the furnace
[1:54:37] <yourliteraldog> Stream Over?
[1:54:41] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Lol he pressed buttons and broke it
[1:54:48] <%Buzzard42> stream over
[1:54:48] <%actual_scum> uh oh
[1:54:54] <+okingjrr> Honestly, you can skip the tutorial from where you were with the tethers
[1:54:55] <%sweetestbeefs> that's pretty bad
[1:54:55] <s1rcuit> I've never seen these bugs
[1:54:58] <solus_is_watching> oh shit thats not very cash money
[1:54:58] <%actual_scum> the early access jank is here
[1:55:01] <NoCreditClear> Maybe just close and reopen the game?
[1:55:05] <Garry_Guyface> You'll soon learn bugs don't happen too often up here
[1:55:07] <%sweetestbeefs> dangit, this game looks so cool too
[1:55:07] <+chaumiester> Have you tried dabbing to victory. I heard that works
[1:55:10] <+MassConnect> I don't get what the game aims to be anyway
[1:55:13] <+thegreenbenis> You really can skip the tutorial at this point. @PatStaresAt
[1:55:16] <%honeyman18> damn...
[1:55:18] <s1rcuit> @solus_is_watching more like crash money
[1:55:18] <+okingjrr> It just shows you about pressurization and salvaging a reator
[1:55:18] <%heartlesshealer> again, probably why the upcoming update will kill current saves
[1:55:18] <%actual_scum> well, come back to it in like 3 months
[1:55:24] <tattleworm> quick googling says that yeah, completing later objectives can break them from showing up, they said they're working on it back in like march
[1:55:25] <%DiscoMatador> Thats wild this game has been in early access for like a year right?
[1:55:30] <+Deekman> back to satisfactory@
[1:55:31] <DaKnightWarrior> Man...
[1:55:37] <Scorchfield> yeah maybe reload the game
[1:55:39] <$RealThiele> open the work order LUL
[1:55:39] <tattleworm> march 2020 i mean
[1:55:41] <+ChaosAethr> welp good stream
[1:55:42] <%greasypete00> what happened
[1:55:42] <%blaggablag> What a shame
[1:55:44] <Ipsenscastle> welp, good stream
[1:55:49] <%sweetestbeefs> this seems like a HUGE issue
[1:55:52] <%blaggablag> And it's such a good game once it's past this
[1:55:52] <+queaks> This is the saddest timeline
[1:55:54] <jorniev> what happened with shipbreaker?
[1:55:57] <%DianaTheAscian> whats happening?
[1:56:00] <%heartlesshealer> the railroading of tutorial is what's breaking
[1:56:03] <%BoxNavy> wow :)
[1:56:04] <NoCreditClear> The tutorial is the only place in the game with scripted events, so I guess that part of the code isn't as polished.
[1:56:06] <+Sternold123> what
[1:56:07] <%Reveresao> Hmm, I played this game a while ago and had similar issues and returned it.
[1:56:12] <leole11> man that sucks
[1:56:18] <%blaggablag> Could you actually like, download a profile and start past the tutorial? It's atually worth it
[1:56:19] <+Opal_Overture> its a good games guys i promise, i have no idea what the fuck
[1:56:21] <%heartlesshealer> rest of the game works, but not the tutorial
[1:56:23] <+queaks> I was gonna get this game but I think Ill wait
[1:56:26] <%SpontaneousC> I cant fucking believe this hasn't been fixed
[1:56:26] <%Jekado> is Gamebreakers
[1:56:27] <%AncelDeLambert> crazy that they all hit you, I never saw any of these
[1:56:32] <yourliteraldog> Nice
[1:56:33] <+thegreenbenis> Tutorial is basically over. @PatStaresAt
[1:56:34] <NoCreditClear> I bought this at launch and didn't get anything this bad. This is whack.
[1:56:36] <%sweetestbeefs> this is a really good game with a horrible start i guess
[1:56:37] <leole11> skip the tutorial, i say
[1:56:38] <1000_buffers> headspace hipbreaker patrick fuck boiven
[1:56:42] <%BoxNavy> this games been out for a minute and its really weird that the tutorial is this fucked :(
[1:56:43] <+queaks> Streamer bug testing live
[1:56:46] <%blaggablag> IT REALLY DOES THO
[1:56:47] <%DiscoMatador> Harddrive game breaker
[1:56:48] <yourliteraldog> Based Progression Bugs
[1:56:48] <%AncelDeLambert> that big sucks, cuz this game has some chill energy
[1:56:49] <solus_is_watching> Sucks cause the game seems pretty neat setting and atmosphere wise
[1:56:53] <NoCreditClear> Skip the tutorial. You were done anyway
[1:56:54] <+NameInsertable> @PatStaresAt You can skip the tutorial if it keeps breaking
[1:56:56] <%Neryl_> @queaks saaaaaame.
[1:56:56] <12gagerager> How could the developers let that go? That's embarrassing as fuck.
[1:57:01] <redrins> its not great when a game thats pretty good leaves a terrible first impression by not working
[1:57:06] <+Katohearts> Skipsies
[1:57:07] <%Jekado> i'm really bummed because i like this game but yeah
[1:57:09] <SuperUltraWolfHammer> these bugs have been there since day 1, which kinda makes this extra sadge
[1:57:10] <LSether> It has the early access symptom of "They cant fix the early game stuff because they need to keep the people who bought the game engaged with more lategame"
[1:57:12] <%Frost_Quill> I pretty much just watch 3 streamers, Pat, and two other people.  They all constantly have horrible bugs interrupt their streams.
[1:57:18] <%BoxNavy> chat will teach you :)
[1:57:26] <+Katohearts> You aren't missing much
[1:57:26] <yourliteraldog> Did a recent update bork this or has it always done this?
[1:57:29] <%SpontaneousC> There was two mechanics left in the tutorial and they're kind of important
[1:57:31] <LSether> I would not recommend skipping it
[1:57:43] <T_Sasquatch> Oh boy skipping the tutorial in one of these crazy games
[1:57:45] <%sweetestbeefs> Vinny?
[1:57:45] <+thegreenbenis> I've never seen it fuck up like that.
[1:57:46] <%blaggablag> The ships blow up in all sorts of fucked up ways when you depressurize them wrong
[1:57:50] <%SpontaneousC> But they're also simple
[1:57:59] <+D00msDayDan> even the game itself feels the weight of eyes
[1:58:03] <leole11> @yourliteraldog pretty sure the boom update revamped the tutorial, bringing these bugs
[1:58:06] <+greasypete00> thats upsetting
[1:58:07] <%actual_scum> non-progression bugs are the WORST though
[1:58:10] <%Ranryu692> that's because Woolie rubbed off on you
[1:58:10] <+ClericOfSparda> I think there's something about streaming that opens up more bugs
[1:58:12] <+terraspan> You get the bad bugs, Woolie gets the hilarious bugs.
[1:58:16] <%heartlesshealer> what's that called, Murphy's Law or something?
[1:58:16] <%mield916> man this is such a shame, i had no progression bugs when i recommended it
[1:58:17] <$RealThiele> yea depressurization turns objects into bullets
[1:58:18] <turtlegryphon> It's just space ships how complicated could it be pat, you cut holes in the ship and get paid.  You don't need tutorials I'm sure.
[1:58:19] <+Proxzo> I mean it's entertaining to just see how messed up things can get
[1:58:26] <zazzera01> its funny, my experience was almost entirely bug free when the game first came out
[1:58:34] <Jaysky> 👍
[1:58:36] <%AncelDeLambert> I wonder if OBS has anything to do with it
[1:58:43] <+Opal_Overture> @AncelDeLambert ...Holy shit, it broke on the pressure part. do you think we hexed it?
[1:58:46] <solus_is_watching> He it's working now it seems
[1:58:51] <+NameInsertable> Yeah, I didn't get these bugs either
[1:58:57] <%wibbwobbler> wibbwobbler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:59:08] <illTemperedSeaBass> Obs doesn't cause in-game bugs.
[1:59:08] <$RealThiele> relog plus new save seems to help
[1:59:11] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt could it be because you changed your keybindings?
[1:59:15] <%PaladinDupre> PaladinDupre subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! Happy 3 years Pat, congratulations on your engagement.
[1:59:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> ... At least, not usually.
[1:59:19] <%Nested_Dreams> Nested_Dreams subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Genre discovery goes brrrrrr
[1:59:37] <+blastazoid00> Is this the outer wilds?
[1:59:38] <LSether> I would wager keybindings had something to do with it
[1:59:39] <leole11> seems unlikely that the bindings would affect it
[1:59:52] <LSether> @leole11 No because it did for me. Lol
[2:00:02] <%thelaxinator> Just got here, theres a lot of HUD going on right now
[2:00:02] <%DiscoMatador> If it broke in such a major way just from rebinding keys thats still turbo Fucked
[2:00:07] <+Deekman> like maybe it's trying to load the tutorial buttons to press and it's not tested with different keys being used aside from the default
[2:00:10] <+Katohearts> Trying to remember if this happened to me
[2:00:12] <%sweetestbeefs> THE BREWSTER
[2:00:13] <%thelaxinator> Is there a fingerless glove meter?
[2:00:43] <%greasypete00> eeeyah
[2:00:46] <+Deekman> @leole11 usually I'd agree but I've seen some crazy shit with early access lol
[2:00:48] <SolidusA> bingo  bongo bob's your uncle
[2:00:49] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> 👍
[2:01:28] <marshimus2019> Sorry what was the bug? I play this game myself and had a couple of them myself . What does tab reveal? I got to level 5 went to purchase an upgrade and menu crashed, had to ctrl-alt-del it
[2:01:33] <%ThirdWelles> ThirdWelles subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 1 month streak! "Hey Patrick, I thought of something funnier than 24."
[2:01:34] <%SpontaneousC> Also something the game never actually tells you, if you press Z and I think the other key is C when next to a part of the ship you'll latch onto it and stop moving
[2:01:57] <T_Sasquatch> That accent LUL
[2:02:11] <jamsbybetty> Pat's burgeoning southern accent is kind of adorable
[2:02:12] <%ThirdWelles> Pat what the hell is your tweet from earlier?
[2:02:15] <marshimus2019> Just hold q and e stops you floating around aimlessly too lol
[2:02:17] <%sweetestbeefs> thats super weird looking
[2:02:19] <%AncelDeLambert> hands are friends
[2:02:40] <%wibbwobbler> i want this as my life
[2:02:41] <solus_is_watching> Space southern is something I didn't know I would like
[2:02:52] <%SpontaneousC> It's useful for stopping yourself without using any thruster fuel
[2:03:01] <ScreamLord> You kinda DO sleep in the yard tho
[2:03:01] <+blastazoid00> Is this one if those factory/creative games?
[2:03:06] <%Buzzard42> @solus_is_watching Space Southern has been excellent since Starcraft did it
[2:03:14] <jorniev> space western is on of my favorite things
[2:03:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> @solus_is_watching There is a criminally short, old tv series called Firefly you need to watch.
[2:03:27] <%Buzzard42> oh MAN Firefly is so perfect
[2:03:38] <s1rcuit> I hate that there's a dissonance between having a southern accent and the use of advanced science/space terminology
[2:03:38] <illTemperedSeaBass> ↑
[2:03:47] <marshimus2019> This narrator wants McConaugheys babies
[2:03:53] <jamsbybetty> firefly hasn't aged especially well but it's still a decent watch
[2:04:06] <yourliteraldog> sloppy cuts
[2:04:10] <+cafefunk> Just got here, whats the plot?
[2:04:14] <marshimus2019> Hey hey hey hey
[2:04:24] <%DianaTheAscian> those cuts hurt me
[2:04:25] <%Mr_Pylon> measure once cut once
[2:04:32] <%SpontaneousC> You're poor and working a shitty dangerous job for less than minimum wage is the plot
[2:04:33] <leole11> @cafefunk you're in debt, deconstruct ship for money
[2:04:34] <%rrratbastard> oh this looks so incredibly satisfying
[2:04:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> I try way too hard to cut as close as possible and end up not actually cutting the piece off
[2:04:48] <yourliteraldog> Measure None Cut Twice
[2:04:51] <CrimsonFox777> @cafefunk $1 Billion in debt, have to deconstruct ships to pay it off and make a living.
[2:04:57] <BaronVonProlix> not even a wage, your working of an impossible debt with peanuts
[2:04:59] <%emperordread> Just gonna put a little bit of salvage here, cause everyone needs a friend PixelBob
[2:05:21] <jorniev> gravity pleae
[2:05:21] <+cafefunk> Damn, harsh
[2:05:26] <Slim_Lipid> aluminium chewsday innit
[2:05:43] <%SpontaneousC> also all your tools cost you money, so does your living quarters, so you're always getting more debt
[2:05:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> right click sucks stuff towards you
[2:06:10] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt careful, you can get sucked into the furnaces and processors
[2:06:12] <jorniev> MASS and GRAVITY puzzles
[2:06:17] <marshimus2019> Wait till you try removing cockpit glass
[2:06:18] <+Katohearts> It's easier to cut panels from above and below because of angles that are hard to describe in chat
[2:06:21] <marshimus2019> All types of fun
[2:06:44] <%heartlesshealer> honestly seems really fun
[2:06:45] <+Katohearts> I didn't even know you could take out the glass
[2:07:03] <%KineticZen> Cool game
[2:07:08] <%heartlesshealer> man, your character touches the walls to stabilize
[2:07:09] <solus_is_watching> Wish I knew I could grab onto the ship when I played this
[2:07:12] <RoamV> Did your character throw their hand out to stop themselves from bumping into that wall?
[2:07:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> has ocd manifested yet?
[2:07:28] <LSether> @solus_is_watching How did you play this without knowing that D:
[2:07:29] <leole11> @RoamV it's a hotkey, not automatic :p
[2:07:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> You have buttons to grab walls with either hand
[2:07:52] <%heartlesshealer> nice, so you actually gotta do it
[2:07:54] <MayorRev> how's pat enjoying the game so far
[2:07:55] <leole11> grabbing walls is SUPER useful for depressurising compartments
[2:07:58] <RoamV> That's a nice little feature
[2:08:01] <BaronVonProlix> lets hope the reavers dont come while your werkin
[2:08:04] <%BinaryFireball> lazor lines
[2:08:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's SO heavy Pat
[2:08:14] <LSether> @MayorRev other then the game breaking but that made him restart, fine.
[2:08:18] <gslayer14> so is the whole game in dry dock or do you get field missions?
[2:08:19] <%BinaryFireball> as someone who deals with lazor lines every day fuck lazor lines
[2:08:22] <%Frost_Quill> I was reading webcomics, is he back up to the part that borked up?
[2:08:32] <+NameInsertable> @PatStaresAt You don't have to guide things that hard, processor and factory have gravity wells
[2:08:39] <LSether> @gslayer14 Drydock for now.
[2:08:43] <+okingjrr> almost there
[2:08:43] <LSether> @Frost_Quill almost
[2:08:49] <%blaggablag> Y know this soundtrack is actually very simmilar to Rimworld's
[2:08:55] <marshimus2019> Yeah but the gravity wells aint that stronk
[2:09:06] <marshimus2019> You still need a good push
[2:09:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Whqt about water and food to live?
[2:09:21] <leole11> as far as i can tell, gravity wells only work up to 8 tons
[2:09:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> cant eat upgrades boss
[2:09:36] <marshimus2019> I got caught in processor gravity spent ages crawling/ spinning away from it lol
[2:09:46] <%heartlesshealer> if you die of starvation you can just clone your body
[2:09:50] <LSether> use a teath- oh right. ;p
[2:10:01] <+okingjrr> missed a spot
[2:10:10] <LSether> @heartlesshealer the real chad move is to just eat your clones for food
[2:10:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> cut some more
[2:10:27] <%blaggablag> @marshimus2019 You can lasso your way out with the tether tool
[2:10:43] <%Frost_Quill> So is there a time limit?  Why would you ever just not do the whole ship at once?
[2:10:50] <%blaggablag> Alternatively you can crawl out with your hands
[2:10:51] <%heartlesshealer> but then you and your clones would be getting multiple paychecks while simultaneously alive. That's a big no-no
[2:10:55] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt don't bother with any furnace material under 50 kg
[2:10:57] <marshimus2019> Depends on play optio
[2:11:05] <+geminitengu> hope your enjoying your new job
[2:11:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> space junkyard
[2:11:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> awesome
[2:11:15] <RawrFatcat> there is a time limit in the main mode @Frost_Quill
[2:11:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Song makes me think of Starcraft. Rednecks in space
[2:11:48] <LSether> Dont jinx it.
[2:11:50] <%blaggablag> Wait until you get explosive charges
[2:11:57] <LSether> @sonofthedeepsouth i think that is the idea
[2:12:01] <+Vestillion> Space belongs to the Rednecks
[2:12:19] <%sweetestbeefs> THE SPACE WILL RISE ONCE AGAIN!!
[2:12:27] <lloyddboy> did pat get muted or is it just me?
[2:12:32] <+Katohearts> Mm, don't get used to doing 0%
[2:12:38] <%heartlesshealer> just you
[2:12:39] <%DianaTheAscian> just u
[2:12:39] <%Dunmarkh> @lloyddboy just you
[2:12:40] <leole11> please do not break
[2:12:40] <LSether> I sort of feel like this is the wrong game for an OCD person. All the asinine shit later that you have to sort for max points lol
[2:12:41] <dan_g_v> so, do whatever careful?
[2:12:46] <%chiluzza> pat has gotta pay off paiges mustard debt
[2:12:55] <%Chichen> tethers are your friends :)
[2:12:57] <Scorchfield> yeah, you almost never get everything on real ships
[2:12:58] <%blaggablag> Yeah hope those mind goblins don't get used to the empty bar
[2:13:00] <s1rcuit> I have to say that I'm enjoying that Pat and Woolie are trying out new game genres on stream
[2:13:08] <%brickwall35> but mind goblins
[2:13:10] <KShirahama> I love that with explosive charges it is possible to put whole ship into barge.
[2:13:10] <+okingjrr> That sounds like a challenge
[2:13:15] <tattleworm> oh you totally can, at some point you just won't want to
[2:13:17] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat I have written multiple papers on how to dispose of just about every known material
[2:13:18] <+queaks> What broke last time?
[2:13:19] <leole11> 0% on javelins is HELL
[2:13:20] <%heartlesshealer> especially in Standard play
[2:13:25] <%blaggablag> The company wipes the scraps. Don't worry about it
[2:13:26] <NoCreditClear> If you wanna go for 0% full salvage, casual mode would have been better for no timer or oxygen
[2:13:28] <+Vestillion> I hear space banjos, Thrusters to max
[2:13:36] <%PhantomMiG> So this is fun
[2:13:38] <%Dunmarkh> this will make or break the stream
[2:13:48] <leole11> FINGERS CROSSED
[2:14:03] <%Mr_Pylon> BUCKLE UP
[2:14:05] <s1rcuit> @PhantomMiG you'd think it wouldn't be
[2:14:07] <leole11> @queaks this very tutorial
[2:14:11] <%blaggablag> And upsy daisy
[2:14:20] <%DiscoMatador> Moment of truth
[2:14:29] <dan_g_v> pressurization? Sounds explosively fun
[2:14:34] <NoCreditClear> huzzah?
[2:14:35] <jorniev> this part of the game is super nuts
[2:14:37] <%sweetestbeefs> oh god pat's CROSSING HIS ARMS
[2:14:40] <LSether> the real OCD killer is when you accidentally depressurize something and stuff just flys ALL OVER THE PLACE and you can never find it all.
[2:14:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kay Billy Bob explain to me dem pressuration
[2:14:41] <%dyedeme> dyedeme subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[2:14:42] <+okingjrr> hurray
[2:14:46] <jorniev> this is such a crazy mechanic
[2:14:53] <%DianaTheAscian> w-wait cloning?
[2:14:53] <%blaggablag> Yay?
[2:14:53] <%Mr_Pylon> ahhhhhhh thank god
[2:14:54] <NoCreditClear> huzzah!!!
[2:14:55] <NitronStreams> YAAAAAAY
[2:14:55] <RoamV> Ey, we did it
[2:14:56] <+okingjrr> QA should be sweating
[2:14:58] <+Katohearts> That was a good noise maybe?
[2:14:58] <%sweetestbeefs> YAYYYY
[2:14:59] <Mr_Rakjo> CLAP
[2:15:01] <%blaggablag> I heard the ding
[2:15:01] <leole11> IT WORKED?
[2:15:01] <s1rcuit> @dan_g_v sometimes it can be a real blast
[2:15:01] <Mr_Rakjo> Clap
[2:15:03] <%blaggablag> YES
[2:15:03] <+D00msDayDan> progress!
[2:15:04] <+thegreenbenis> Thank fuck
[2:15:04] <+Katohearts> There we go
[2:15:05] <hamborgini> wait, if you die before you can pay back your debt, they clone you until you've paid up? that's fucked up
[2:15:06] <%Frost_Quill> Oh thank Christ.
[2:15:12] <leole11> OMG
[2:15:14] <iosephe> clap
[2:15:15] <+Vestillion> Yee, and I do declare, Haw.
[2:15:16] <%DianaTheAscian> like they make a clone if u die on the job?
[2:15:16] <$RealThiele> DEV RESTORED
[2:15:17] <DaKnightWarrior> Nice!
[2:15:21] <blaggablag> CHECK OUT that fuckin airlock
[2:15:31] <%PhantomMiG> @s1rcuit I learned how to dispose of plastic as a fuel for power plants
[2:15:40] <%blaggablag> it's an airlock don't worry
[2:15:56] <s1rcuit> @PhantomMiG where at?
[2:15:57] <%PhantomMiG> @s1rcuit And that is fun. Toxic as hell but fun
[2:15:58] <%UltraViolet371> those are nearly the same airlock semiotics as in Alien, cool
[2:16:20] <NoCreditClear> Rapid Disassembly!
[2:16:29] <%blaggablag> @UltraViolet371 BBI art team draws HEAVILY from Ron Cobb
[2:16:41] <%PhantomMiG> @s1rcuit All theoretical work as it part of my materials engineering masters
[2:16:47] <+cafefunk> This feels like a space retail job
[2:16:48] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> getting alien 4'd
[2:16:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Jesus
[2:16:57] <%UltraViolet371> @UltraViolet371 cool, as everyone should
[2:16:57] <+cafefunk> Not worth it and fake happiness
[2:16:58] <+ianabstract> if you run out of thruster fuel you can crawl around with your hands
[2:17:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why wouldnt this shit be automated
[2:17:11] <%blaggablag> Try crawling it's fun
[2:17:15] <s1rcuit> @PhantomMiG cool, still working on the masters?
[2:17:15] <jorniev> this is space blue collar work
[2:17:17] <$RealThiele> rednecks are cheaper than robots
[2:17:20] <%AncelDeLambert> psaUp
[2:17:28] <%Jekado> just cut it in half right now!
[2:17:31] <heartlesshealer> you need manual control of hands for crawling, that's why it's not automated
[2:17:38] <%Jekado> psaSmug
[2:17:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ha
[2:17:50] <%BestTeaMaker> live bomb got it
[2:17:50] <$PhantomMiG> @s1rcuit Yup were I study its only a 1 year program
[2:17:51] <tanarath> OH BOY
[2:17:52] <s1rcuit> hare the hand controls new?
[2:17:52] <%AncelDeLambert> you get like half a minute, but yeah, cut those cut-points
[2:18:01] <%blaggablag> @UltraViolet371 Amen to that
[2:18:06] <+Katohearts> Yeah he doesn't open with that
[2:18:09] <tattleworm> pat reacts to reactor explosion
[2:18:12] <%AncelDeLambert> @s1rcuit nah, hands have been around for a long time
[2:18:15] <+ElectricHoodie> just a little nuclear meltdown, nothing to worry about
[2:18:16] <s1rcuit> @PhantomMiG cool, good luck with that
[2:18:26] <leole11> TUTORIAL DEFEATED
[2:18:32] <+thegreenbenis> I recommend you cut a way out. @PatStaresAt
[2:18:38] <tanarath> loving the interference from the radiation
[2:18:38] <%Broand> aaaaa
[2:18:41] <%Broand> aaaaaaa
[2:18:45] <yourliteraldog> cut from the inside
[2:18:46] <%Jekado> if its not red you can't cut through
[2:18:48] <+ianabstract> you gotta get the cut points inside
[2:18:48] <%Broand> phwew
[2:18:52] <%blaggablag> No red hud means no cut
[2:18:56] <%Jekado> If your reticle is not red you can't cut it
[2:18:56] <+okingjrr> you go from inside out
[2:18:56] <+Katohearts> Cut from inside
[2:18:58] <s1rcuit> @AncelDeLambert I don't remember seeing that, thanks though
[2:18:59] <ScreamLord> Inside job
[2:19:01] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Cut from inside
[2:19:03] <%sweetestbeefs> how about the inside though?
[2:19:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt use dem cutpoints boiiiiiiiii
[2:19:06] <+thegreenbenis> Inside pat.
[2:19:10] <%Broand> Interior plating is cuttable, exterior isn't
[2:19:11] <A0N33> Oh good, no need to worry about accidentally cutting through the reactor YET.
[2:19:15] <tanarath> zuhhhhh
[2:19:17] <%blaggablag> Outter hull is stronger, as it usually goes
[2:19:17] <+ianabstract> no no no no

[2:19:19] <Broand> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:19:19] <+thegreenbenis> Use the cut point.
[2:19:19] <tanarath> No.
[2:19:19] <NoCreditClear> lol it didn't depressurize the crawlspaces
[2:19:20] <Scorchfield> there is a area between the inside walls at the outside walls that might still be pressurized, also the cockpit might be

[2:20:43] <+Katohearts> So you can cut the ship from the inside
[2:20:44] <solus_is_watching> Mhmm
[2:20:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> Have you learned?
[2:20:44] <%Jekado> like some form of... reaction... happened

[2:20:52] <tanarath> Reactor go critical.
[2:20:53] <%sweetestbeefs> leearned
[2:20:55] <Giztech> cut the back section just behind the reactor. so that you have a open path :D
[2:20:56] <zazzera01> oh no he's turning space southern
[2:21:02] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[2:21:03] <CrimsonFox777> Sure we can!
[2:21:04] <Scorchfield> cut away the walls first so  you have a straight shot
[2:21:05] <$RealThiele> do not taunt happy fun reactor
[2:21:05] <NoCreditClear> Reactor is VERY SENSITIVE. Do not bump and do not bring it near fuel lines or electronics
[2:21:09] <jorniev> ITS HIS FIRST DAY
[2:21:11] <+thegreenbenis> Reactors are dangerous. @PatStaresAt
[2:21:12] <%AncelDeLambert> oh we're SUPER judging you, WEAVER TOLD YOU
[2:21:12] <+ianabstract> you gotta open the ship up by cutting the cut points inside
[2:21:15] <%Mr_Pylon> Prime Patron may have failed, but vatgrown Patron 001 has this
[2:21:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> I will judge right nah boy
[2:21:17] <+D00msDayDan> it's his first day
[2:21:17] <%sweetestbeefs> it's too late, I've already judged you
[2:21:17] <+cafefunk> Is Paige ok?
[2:21:17] <%BoxNavy> im judging :)
[2:21:22] <+Deekman> not since arizona succeeded
[2:21:23] <lloyddboy> the yee-law
[2:21:24] <videogamegeffy> ain't no laws in space, I recon.
[2:21:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> There aint no laws in space
[2:21:33] <illTemperedSeaBass> It's against the yee-law.
[2:21:34] <yourliteraldog> pats clone
[2:21:35] <RetributionP> judging you super hard failing a tutorial in a video gamr
[2:21:35] <Slim_Lipid> thought crimes for judging the mentally disabled FeelsBadMan
[2:21:37] <+thegreenbenis> Now cut a way out.
[2:21:43] <%blaggablag> The puzzle is finding the way to get the reactor from it's niche to the barge in the least time possible without it bumping with anything in the way
[2:21:48] <solus_is_watching> Oh no, he'll be eating cat fish and drinking sweet tea by the end of this stream.
[2:21:57] <%AncelDeLambert> not until you turn off the oxy unit, no
[2:21:57] <%sweetestbeefs> look for some cut points my man
[2:22:01] <+thegreenbenis> Now cut off some panels.
[2:22:06] <%AncelDeLambert> there ya go
[2:22:09] <%AncelDeLambert> now CUT
[2:22:13] <Giztech> cut the butt
[2:22:15] <gslayer14> look at all those cut points...
[2:22:15] <+thegreenbenis> Look at the cut points dood.
[2:22:19] <+Katohearts> Cockpit is pressurized
[2:22:20] <+okingjrr> hit the cut points
[2:22:27] <NoCreditClear> cut the reactor unless you're a soward
[2:22:28] <Peter9OOO> cut a direct path to the barge
[2:22:32] <%AncelDeLambert> hazard yellow everywhere, but eyes that do not see
[2:22:32] <+thegreenbenis> YES
[2:22:32] <zazzera01> yellow points are your key to freedom
[2:22:47] <$RealThiele> Patron 03 incoming
[2:22:48] <KShirahama> there is air in walls
[2:22:49] <%Broand> Try hitting the cut points underneath the reactor
[2:22:54] <NenaFan101> We breaking ships
[2:22:59] <NoCreditClear> the crawlspaces were still pressurized
[2:22:59] <+thegreenbenis> Watching pat play causes me anxiety.
[2:23:01] <CaptCatastrophe> Pat, you can cut the supports to remove the floor.
[2:23:01] <Yakobro> decompression
[2:23:05] <+okingjrr> the crawlspace depressurized
[2:23:05] <%furiousfurioso> the side parts were pressurized
[2:23:06] <%Daxalog> Ship just split in 2
[2:23:06] <+thegreenbenis> It's fine!
[2:23:06] <%brickwall35> because you cut it in half
[2:23:10] <+Cerabret100> I mean, you cut out a wall, i'd be upset too
[2:23:14] <%AncelDeLambert> what's great is that once you get into the outer sheath, you can use the buzzsaw to double up the cut points and save wear and tear on your laser
[2:23:15] <CatsDrunkonCopper> calculated
[2:23:17] <%blaggablag> That's a bug I think
[2:23:19] <ScreamLord> NOW you can yank the core
[2:23:21] <+Katohearts> Huh, there was air in those
[2:23:23] <+Katohearts> wild
[2:23:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat you can do just straight down
[2:23:29] <NoCreditClear> the music is deceptive lol. it sounds scary but you didn't do anything wrong yet lol
[2:23:33] <+okingjrr> Congrats
[2:23:36] <%Jekado> Does pat know about reeling in?
[2:23:38] <%blaggablag> Tether it downwards!
[2:23:39] <solus_is_watching> PHEW
[2:23:43] <%blaggablag> Eyyyyy
[2:23:44] <%takotoots> Clap
[2:23:45] <%sweetestbeefs> you coulda done just straight down
[2:23:47] <$RealThiele> bomb defused
[2:23:48] <%Jekado> I think there is a way to reel in objects but you changed the controls?
[2:23:50] <gslayer14> so whats stopping it from exploding over there???
[2:23:51] <%sweetestbeefs> but good job!
[2:23:51] <%TheWinged7> just launch a nuke at the planet, no big deal
[2:23:55] <%blaggablag> pog

[2:24:05] <%Jekado> @gslayer14 space net
[2:24:18] <jorniev> DONT TOUCH THAT
[2:24:19] <%Broand> try cutting some of the other points so you know what happens when you do
[2:24:26] <%Jekado> it should be left mouse to grab and right mouse to reel in object?
[2:24:30] <s1rcuit> @goatbait yes
[2:24:32] <+HariEdwin> Is this about scrapping a spaceship
[2:24:37] <+okingjrr> Tether that big baby

[2:24:40] <ScreamLord> Tethers friends
[2:24:43] <%rrratbastard> scrap a ship, pay your debt
[2:24:44] <DestroPrime83> Why is the video cutting and repeating randomly?
[2:24:46] <NoCreditClear> That whole ass-end can get yeeted into a processor
[2:24:54] <%blaggablag> You can cut that from outside
[2:24:55] <+HariEdwin> That's cool
[2:25:10] <+thegreenbenis> Cut points on the outside. @PatStaresAt
[2:25:11] <zazzera01> rip engine
[2:25:16] <%sweetestbeefs> holy tethers batman
[2:25:17] <Zudrag> the processor and salvager area have their own little pull when something's infront of the blue and red field
[2:25:29] <BackflipCharm> So this is space salvager the video game?

[2:29:24] <%rrratbastard> LEARN HOW THIS 28 YEAR OLD SAVED UP AND BOUGHT A SPACE CONDO OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR
[2:29:24] <yourliteraldog> Time to start chucking things at earth, until they wipe our debt
[2:29:26] <jorniev> WHY DONT YOU JUST PICK YOURSELF FROM THE BOOT STRAPS FROM YOUR SPACE SUIT
[2:29:26] <%Frost_Quill> How much is a credit worth?  Is it like dollars?  Yen?  Money from a country about to collapse?  How much is it???
[2:29:26] <DestroPrime83> Does Space debt suck more than earth debt?
[2:29:28] <%Pukenasty> pat sold his sole to the company store
[2:29:42] <%heartlesshealer> so this is just the daily fee
[2:29:48] <hairtoday> he's not going back to retail at leasyt
[2:29:50] <%heartlesshealer> daily
[2:29:53] <%ssjklyco> You can't go space homeless either
[2:29:54] <%AncelDeLambert> in space no-one can hear you debt
[2:29:56] <HeroToxiko> it's like tales of xillia 2 where you unlock the secret ending by fully paying off your impossible debt
[2:29:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Space is also a vaccuum, so it always sucks
[2:29:57] <Jokobeast> Now there is nowhere uncorrupted by capitalism
[2:30:00] <jorniev> also they revive you and you are more in debt
[2:30:02] <%goatbait> So if you leave Earth your debts are erased?
[2:30:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> HA
[2:30:13] <+Deekman> yeah but you can write that off on your space taxes
[2:30:14] <Psyramics> like 60% of that is gear rental
[2:30:16] <yourliteraldog> Like our Christian God Intended
[2:30:16] <+thegreenbenis> In space no-one can hear you pay interest.
[2:30:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pay t9 go work Wagie
[2:30:19] <$RealThiele> bootstraps activate
[2:30:20] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt ships get bigger and thus has more valuable salvage
[2:30:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> In theory, you could live in the middle of the forest. Can't live in the middle of an asteroid field :)
[2:30:32] <%blaggablag> No conspicuous shipbreakin under capitalism, Pat
[2:30:33] <%sweetestbeefs> safety third huh
[2:30:35] <tattleworm> you gotta click on the sticker category and then you can put it on one of your tools @PatStaresAt
[2:30:41] <%Frost_Quill> Half a million CREDITS.  We don't know how much that actually is.  Could be like 100 bucks for all we know.
[2:30:45] <%Shackle_Rustyford> work at the speed of unsafety
[2:30:48] <yourliteraldog> Pull A marco Inaros
[2:30:58] <$RealThiele> well his first tutorial mission gave 200k
[2:31:03] <%heartlesshealer> remember to repair when things break, eat that money
[2:31:05] <HellishLancer> What do you think of this game so far?
[2:31:11] <%rrratbastard> ran outta LT, boss
[2:31:14] <NoCreditClear> Gotta win more Lynx Fun Bux
[2:31:15] <%Frost_Quill> Either we're being underpaid massively or we owe a ridiculous amount of debt.
[2:31:17] <%Shackle_Rustyford> cant wait for the prequel: bangladeshi shipbreaker
[2:31:18] <%blaggablag> upgrade the charge shot on the grapply whenever you can
[2:31:19] <+thegreenbenis> You can eventually buy your own equipment. @PatStaresAt
[2:31:23] <%rrratbastard> you break it you buy it
[2:31:36] <LSether> Ya it makes you really feel how much it sucks to work at this place.
[2:31:37] <%heartlesshealer> Capitalism is designed against sustainability =)
[2:31:41] <$RealThiele> oc anus
[2:31:44] <+thegreenbenis> SAME SHIP
[2:31:53] <+ianabstract> you gotta go to the catalog
[2:31:55] <+ianabstract> to get a new one
[2:31:56] <leole11> probably check catalog
[2:31:56] <%sweetestbeefs> ocey anus
[2:31:59] <Zeif00> oceanmyass
[2:32:07] <NoCreditClear> expand tether max ASAP
[2:32:13] <%Jekado> YEP
[2:32:15] <zazzera01> you can buy more tethers but it'll cost ya
[2:32:16] <Daxalog> You have to get it refueled
[2:32:17] <yourliteraldog> get rekt you poor
[2:32:18] <%Jekado> you run out of resources FAST
[2:32:23] <$RealThiele> didnt pay that air surcharge
[2:32:24] <jorniev> YOU THINK BREATHING IS FREE!?
[2:32:25] <%heartlesshealer> oxygen is your shift timer
[2:32:27] <HellishLancer> Right click to zip line
[2:32:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> What, you think air is free?!
[2:32:27] <%Jekado> Thethers are limited too pat!
[2:32:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAY TO BREATH
[2:32:28] <+Twinmin> getting into a pressurized ship will give you oxygen
[2:32:32] <turtlegryphon> If you've got time to breathe you've got time to clean.  GET TO WORK
[2:32:34] <%sweetestbeefs> time limits YAY
[2:32:37] <%heartlesshealer> air costs money
[2:32:38] <skyentombment> @zazzera01 My wallet's in the car!
[2:32:42] <%sweetestbeefs> WORK FASTER BOY
[2:32:43] <Scorchfield> yeah, its worth it to upgrade O2 soonish
[2:32:44] <%Frost_Quill> Oh, oxygen is your time.  I'm guessing you can upgrade it later?
[2:32:55] <%heartlesshealer> there's a no time limit mode, but that's not what Pat picked
[2:33:02] <+Katohearts> Time is your time
[2:33:05] <leole11> yes, you can totally upgrade it, and make it recharge in pressurized areas
[2:33:05] <zazzera01> good plan
[2:33:06] <%Frost_Quill> I want a game like Subnautica but in space instead.  This is a step in that direction and I love it.
[2:33:07] <NoCreditClear> @Frost_Quill It's not your time. There's also a shift timer.
[2:33:10] <+thegreenbenis> @Frost_Quill No you have a regular timer, you can just buy more air
[2:33:12] <%Shackle_Rustyford> nothin quite like a day in the space salt mines
[2:33:15] <tattleworm> vertical cutter might be better here
[2:33:16] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> ship cutting woo
[2:33:16] <jorniev> All these trillenials thinking they can breathe for free
[2:33:18] <%Jekado> just wide cutter is faster... but less safe
[2:33:22] <%blaggablag> You can line cut those
[2:33:26] <%sweetestbeefs> gotta do it quick tho
[2:33:28] <%Broand> Oxygen is NOT your time, oxygen is just something you have to keep an eye on
[2:33:42] <+thegreenbenis> Air ain't free.
[2:33:49] <Zeif00> Space banjo Kreygasm
[2:33:50] <+koriar> Just joined, but the line cutter mode is drastically more efficient for all of these cuts
[2:33:50] <NoCreditClear> Oxygen is only interesting if you crack your helmet and it leaks out
[2:33:52] <tattleworm> they patched the airlocks to make them easier to remove, they're so much better now
[2:33:54] <leole11> you can buy it
[2:33:57] <faegbeard> just hold your breath
[2:33:58] <+Proxzo> you gotta buy more O2
[2:34:01] <%Shackle_Rustyford> this music is based
[2:34:01] <NoCreditClear> Buy more at the console by your hab
[2:34:02] <LSether> ya the airlock is a separate thing haha.
[2:34:03] <+Katohearts> You can get through small spaces
[2:34:06] <+thegreenbenis> You can buy more.
[2:34:08] <%chiluzza> work faster wage slave
[2:34:10] <+Proxzo> basically restock at teh console when your low
[2:34:11] <$RealThiele> MTX O2
[2:34:11] <+Katohearts> You can buy more air
[2:34:13] <LSether> @PatStaresAt Go...buy some at the station near the hab entrance.
[2:34:13] <+thegreenbenis> Just buy more air. @PatStaresAt
[2:34:16] <gslayer14> other side of the airlock/
[2:34:18] <%goatbait> I wonder how long would it take until we have to buy air
[2:34:20] <%Frost_Quill> Where's the shift timer?  I legitimately don't see it.
[2:34:21] <%sweetestbeefs> @Shackle_Rustyford based? based on what?
[2:34:22] <Scorchfield> when it starts getting low you have to go to the console near the Hab to buy more
[2:34:22] <T_Sasquatch> Can't wait for space accidents
[2:34:22] <HellishLancer> buy more oxygen at the kiosk near the hub
[2:34:25] <+Sword_of_Stupid> Refill at buy station
[2:34:27] <gslayer14> nvm
[2:34:29] <PinoProxie> SourPls
[2:34:33] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you can buy more air and sometimes find some in the ship
[2:34:38] <%Shackle_Rustyford> this feels like a firefly game
[2:34:38] <%BinaryFireball> man I hate space banjo
[2:34:42] <%Broand> You can buy oxygen from the hab
[2:34:48] <%Shackle_Rustyford> in fact this would do well with a firefly motif
[2:34:57] <%Broand> But there's a different timer which also exists
[2:34:57] <+Sword_of_Stupid> If tether has material in the way it breaks
[2:35:00] <%chiluzza> you can daisy chain them
[2:35:02] <%KineticZen> Bluegrass, but it's Pale Blue Dot Grass
[2:35:02] <DestroPrime83> man i love space banjos
[2:35:03] <$RealThiele> thanks capitalism lady
[2:35:03] <+thegreenbenis> Dig this space banjo.
[2:35:05] <AdmiralButtloaf> this music is called Zydeco
[2:35:07] <LSether> @PatStaresAt Pat really though. Go buy more air at the console before you die.
[2:35:09] <%Jekado> Inside
[2:35:11] <leole11> press Y to deattach all tethers
[2:35:12] <%BinaryFireball> man
[2:35:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Are you tho
[2:35:15] <%BinaryFireball> man listen
[2:35:17] <NoCreditClear> detaching nano panels with an airlock is a bitch
[2:35:17] <%Broand> Go through the crawlspace to the other side of ir
[2:35:20] <%heartlesshealer> did you cut the other side?
[2:35:21] <tattleworm> you should be able to squeeze around the airlock
[2:35:21] <%Jekado> in the cuff of the airlock
[2:35:22] <%BinaryFireball> I hate space banjo
[2:35:29] <%Jekado> yes
[2:35:30] <%Broand> Look for the control panel
[2:35:33] <+Katohearts> You can worm your way through the crawlspace
[2:35:33] <KShirahama> airlock has 6 cut points
[2:35:33] <gslayer14> maybe use the handle?
[2:35:34] <%Jekado> you can cut through the door
[2:35:35] <jorniev> honest work doesnt always mean honest pay
[2:35:35] <%Lizard0TM> button?
[2:35:35] <%KineticZen> Door controls?
[2:35:35] <%Jekado> but air
[2:35:36] <%Shackle_Rustyford> theres something hilariously dystopian about the phrase "buy air"
[2:35:36] <%rrratbastard> space banjo swamp music
[2:35:37] <+thegreenbenis> Look right
[2:35:38] <%rrratbastard> cosmic bog
[2:35:40] <HellishLancer> cut it open
[2:35:40] <+Katohearts> even it it looks too narrow
[2:35:40] <+thegreenbenis> Handle
[2:35:40] <$RealThiele> beeeeam
[2:35:42] <yourliteraldog> dngr
[2:35:42] <%Jekado> there is still air in there!
[2:35:43] <iosephe> pat is blind
[2:35:43] <+koriar> there's a handle just to the right
[2:35:44] <ScreamLord> BLIND
[2:35:47] <+Twinmin> controls are on the right
[2:35:48] <faegbeard> pressure oh no no
[2:35:50] <%heartlesshealer> you did not cut off the other side of inside the wall
[2:35:52] <+thegreenbenis> Look right
[2:35:53] <%Lizard0TM> Pat, there's a button on the right
[2:35:56] <+thegreenbenis> Oh boy.
[2:35:56] <%KineticZen> Oh no no no
[2:35:56] <$RealThiele> shhh handles are for wimps
[2:35:58] <NoCreditClear> I don't think the handle will work since the reactor is gonew
[2:36:00] <yourliteraldog> lol
[2:36:01] <%sweetestbeefs> @PatStaresAt handle on your right!
[2:36:03] <+ianabstract> you can pull off the control panels and put them in the barge
[2:36:07] <Winter_Rain> hello. first time finding you live. this game looks interesting
[2:36:10] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[2:36:10] <LSether> i mean to be fair i always cut the ships apart like this.
[2:36:31] <faegbeard> wrist at risk
[2:36:33] <%twistedj3ster> oh, the arm thing is a cool feature!
[2:36:36] <%Broand> nice use of hand
[2:36:40] <LSether> Sure thats how arms work
[2:36:43] <+Jekado> No there are mroe cut points inside
[2:36:44] <+okingjrr> there are two hidden cutpoints on the airlock still
[2:36:49] <+Katohearts> There's still two more
[2:36:57] <+okingjrr> there ya go
[2:37:02] <%twistedj3ster> no but cut more tho
[2:37:05] <+thegreenbenis> Remove the space spincter.
[2:37:07] <NoCreditClear> clean cutting airlocks SUUUUCKS
[2:37:13] <%Lizard0TM> Oxygen

[2:37:48] <%Frost_Quill> Where's the shift timer then?
[2:37:51] <%heartlesshealer> time for bills
[2:37:54] <+Strigiform> Its capitalism the company just wants to charge you more money for living
[2:37:58] <$RealThiele> CONSUME
[2:38:02] <%Shackle_Rustyford> time for oxygen loan debt
[2:38:03] <Zebroneath> All this blue color work reminds me of Alien
[2:38:03] <tattleworm> you can grapple and reel yourself in to move around faster if you need to
[2:38:04] <+terraspan> tethers

[2:38:16] <+cafefunk> Jesus christ
[2:38:19] <gslayer14> interesting
[2:38:20] <faegbeard> imagine thinking you can consume company oxygen for free :^)
[2:38:20] <NoCreditClear> I remember when you couldn't buy utility keys and had to farm them off of easy Macks lol
[2:38:22] <+HealerByDay> HealerByDay subscribed with Prime. 
[2:38:22] <PinoProxie> enjoy your air wagie
[2:38:24] <%mield916> pat you can use the grapple to move faster towards the hab
[2:38:25] <+RabbiKing> But time is money
[2:38:25] <%heartlesshealer> what are you gonna do, not die?
[2:38:25] <+Katohearts> snrk
[2:38:25] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you got a loicense for that air?
[2:38:34] <+okingjrr> Too heavy
[2:38:34] <+allups> dont forget u can pull ur self, least i think so form the last time i play
[2:38:35] <jorniev> @Kain5707 Breaking spaceships and getting fucked by super corps
[2:38:42] <+thegreenbenis> Tethers pat.
[2:38:43] <%sweetestbeefs> tether?
[2:38:47] <%blaggablag> Tether it man come on
[2:38:48] <%Daxalog> Too much MASS
[2:38:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, tethers
[2:38:50] <+koriar> Just use a tether
[2:38:51] <%chiluzza> its part of a ship pat
[2:38:51] <%Frost_Quill> The prices mean nothing, how many credits does it take to buy like a toilet?  There's no reference so it means nothing to me.
[2:38:53] <triggersqueeze1985> Bagooner juice
[2:38:54] <LVL1_Scumbag> Metal is heavy
[2:38:55] <$RealThiele> tetherrr
[2:38:58] <+thegreenbenis> Tether it my man. @PatStaresAt
[2:38:58] <+ianabstract> take the control panel off
[2:39:00] <+okingjrr> You have a mass indicator when you grapple an object, red means it's too heavy
[2:39:02] <+koriar> you can buy more tethers at that same station
[2:39:02] <BoSteed> Tethers are your friend :)
[2:39:04] <LSether> @mield916 You can also mash yourself into the hab so hard it damages you. So...careful with that lol
[2:39:05] <%chiluzza> what do you expect? like the mass of  gerbals?
[2:39:11] <%Shackle_Rustyford> this game looks like a good podcast listening to game
[2:39:13] <%BoxNavy> SourPls hanging on the edge of tomorrow
[2:39:13] <%sweetestbeefs> you can buy more tethers
[2:39:14] <%blaggablag> Tethers are your friends
[2:39:16] <%Lizard0TM> if the governments of the world could find a way to tax oxygen right now, they absolutely would. Why are people surprised to see future space oxygen isn't free?
[2:39:16] <xbb1024> can you buy more tethers?
[2:39:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> tethers are love tethers are life
[2:39:17] <gordonfreeman45> oh I like the music
[2:39:23] <%asgard147> it's a giant slab of metal pat, of course it's heavy
[2:39:29] <ammobasket> Tether
[2:39:30] <ScreamLord> Will Pat ever notice the switch next to the door?
[2:39:31] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt the airlock used to be a nightmare to dismantle. You had to cut some ten points or more to get everything, and you still had to shred a panel to get the doors
[2:39:34] <%Xevtes> hanging on the edge of tomorrow SingsNote
[2:39:35] <%goatbait> Can
[2:39:39] <$RealThiele> until a fusion bomb shows up
[2:39:42] <%Mr_Pylon> it's a fantastic game to play while listening to a podcast
[2:39:45] <%goatbait> can't imagine this being relaxing cuz of the timer
[2:39:50] <triggersqueeze1985> Seesh that’s heavy
[2:39:51] <jorniev> This nightmare future is so relaxing
[2:39:51] <NoCreditClear> no, it's cut, it's just HEAVY
[2:39:52] <KShirahama> they are just heavy
[2:39:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> tether it
[2:39:58] <gslayer14> cone piece
[2:40:00] <+thegreenbenis> JUST HEAVY
[2:40:02] <Scorchfield> tethers are your friend
[2:40:03] <nomolomo> enjoying the game so far?
[2:40:08] <%blaggablag> TETHER IT FUCKER
[2:40:10] <triggersqueeze1985> What’s this predator vision?
[2:40:17] <+taggerung403> this is some nice music
[2:40:18] <+ianabstract> you can see the total weight on the hud when you mouse over it
[2:40:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> go tether go
[2:40:25] <RoamV> God that looks satisfying to watch it fly away
[2:40:27] <NoCreditClear> I think the tutorial makes your grappler buff so you can manhandle stuff easy
[2:40:29] <nomolomo> can really appreciate this basion sounding soundtrack
[2:40:32] <%Shackle_Rustyford> i cant stop thinking about firefly
[2:40:43] <LSether> So like. This game is fun untill a certain point. Then its like "Ah right the tedium has kicked in"
[2:40:47] <gslayer14> it's weird how your legs have no hitbox
[2:40:48] <leole11> pat is going to depressurize the cockpit while it weighs nothing, it's going to launch into space lmao
[2:41:02] <%blaggablag> Tether literally everything
[2:41:09] <%blaggablag> I'm not even kidding
[2:41:10] <%asgard147> SourPls
[2:41:12] <NoCreditClear> you can buy more tethers
[2:41:18] <%blaggablag> THat's what the big spokes are for
[2:41:23] <+thegreenbenis> You can buy more.
[2:41:29] <%twistedj3ster> did Pat asphyxiate yet?
[2:41:30] <+okingjrr> cut the walls or cut the door
[2:41:30] <zazzera01> cut the doors off
[2:41:32] <+thegreenbenis> Shoot the glass.
[2:41:32] <nomolomo> this music slaaaaps
[2:41:33] <+ianabstract> open the airlock and hold on to your butt
[2:41:33] <+fancypan> There's a handle by the door
[2:41:34] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:41:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> tethers are dirt cheap compared to what you make
[2:41:37] <triggersqueeze1985> Ever sneeze and tooth flies out?
[2:41:37] <%Mr_Pylon> no power now
[2:41:40] <gslayer14> no power
[2:41:41] <jorniev> this game feels great
[2:41:41] <leole11> no reactor, can't open it
[2:41:42] <+okingjrr> It's no longer powered
[2:41:43] <LSether> You can actually move most of the basic wall panels if you upgrade the power of the grapple
[2:41:43] <NoCreditClear> reactor is gone. no power
[2:41:44] <+thegreenbenis> @twistedj3ster Did get blown up once.
[2:41:45] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Depowered
[2:41:45] <+koriar> when you separated it you cut the power
[2:41:47] <KShirahama> just cut since you removed power source
[2:41:47] <gslayer14> cut in
[2:41:48] <LSether> No power.
[2:41:51] <+thegreenbenis> No power.
[2:41:51] <+koriar> just cut the door
[2:41:52] <tattleworm> cut door
[2:41:53] <+allups> cut ur way in
[2:41:53] <+ianabstract> gotta cut the door
[2:41:53] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL You removed the power source
[2:41:54] <HellishLancer> You NEED to cut open the door
[2:41:56] <%blaggablag> No power, you cut the reactor
[2:41:56] <%Daxalog> Guess youll have to crack er open!
[2:41:59] <%Mr_Pylon> time for brute smarts
[2:41:59] <abelincoln_catpuncher> love the soundtrack so far, very much space truckin vibes
[2:42:00] <%mield916> you can lazer through the door
[2:42:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> WELP
[2:42:04] <Scorchfield> at this point you would need to cut in
[2:42:06] <+koriar> or the glass I guess
[2:42:07] <BoSteed> If only you had some way... to cut things....
[2:42:07] <%asgard147> have to cut in
[2:42:07] <NoCreditClear> time for FUN
[2:42:08] <+thegreenbenis> Make a hole.
[2:42:09] <+ianabstract> shoot the glass
[2:42:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> crack it
[2:42:11] <%twistedj3ster> @thegreenbenis Oh, nice
[2:42:14] <+allups> turn off the air lock too
[2:42:15] <CrimsonFox777> Please do not fuck the space ship.
[2:42:20] <ScreamLord> SHoot glass
[2:42:20] <+allups> o
[2:42:25] <HellishLancer> Melt the glass
[2:42:26] <+thegreenbenis> Shoot the cockpit glass.
[2:42:27] <+okingjrr> hahahaha
[2:42:28] <+koriar> hahaha, that works too
[2:42:29] <NoCreditClear> lame he went for the smart move
[2:42:30] <%blaggablag> sure you can
[2:42:31] <+allups> fuck it
[2:42:31] <gslayer14> lmao
[2:42:32] <leole11> that also works
[2:42:32] <LSether> Shoot. The glass. as they say. ;p
[2:42:35] <leole11> LMAO
[2:42:37] <+ianabstract> that works
[2:42:40] <leole11> YESSSS
[2:42:41] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no did he not open the door before turning off the oxy unit?
[2:42:43] <+thegreenbenis> I guess you can do that.
[2:42:44] <NoCreditClear> nah, it'll shoot off into space
[2:42:45] <+koriar> surely it would be fine
[2:42:46] <$BinaryFireball> naaaaaaah
[2:42:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Explodes the entire station
[2:42:48] <%BinaryFireball> its fiiiiiiiiiine
[2:42:48] <%blaggablag> ah, the yeet option
[2:42:48] <$RealThiele> LUL dammit he knew
[2:42:49] <+okingjrr> You're losing a bunch of barge objects
[2:42:50] <+D00msDayDan> sometimes you gotta do it ugly
[2:42:50] <+Opal_Overture> Yeah. Pussy.
[2:42:50] <%Mr_Pylon> sometimes ya gotta crack that air seal
[2:42:50] <%twistedj3ster> do it anyway
[2:42:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Just do it tho
[2:42:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> GOOD
[2:42:52] <triggersqueeze1985> Y’all some  backseat motherfuckers
[2:42:55] <%Jekado> good buy all the goodies inside i guess
[2:42:56] <+thegreenbenis> Nah it's fine
[2:42:59] <LSether> Well...The computers inside the cockpit are sort of valuable barge stuff...
[2:43:00] <jorniev> LP FUNSIES
[2:43:04] <%AncelDeLambert> yeaaaaaaah, depressurizing multiple rooms is still wonky
[2:43:04] <Zudrag> look at all that destroyed material
[2:43:07] <%SaiyanShoto> Do it pussy
[2:43:08] <%Lizard0TM> leave it to blow up some other fuckers face
[2:43:11] <gslayer14> oxy refill time
[2:43:11] <%blaggablag> Your lack of will to experiment is getting exasperating, Boivin
[2:43:12] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> 02 level
[2:43:13] <HellishLancer> Pat there is nothing to explode
[2:43:25] <+thegreenbenis> @triggersqueeze1985 Mostly they are trying to get him to blow himself up because it's amusing.
[2:43:31] <+koriar> You can also yeet it into the barge since there's valuable barge stuff there
[2:43:35] <Scorchfield> at long as you arn't right next to it and you don't care about it breaking some things violent decompression is fine
[2:43:35] <+ianabstract> you can use the splitsaw to cut multiple cut points at the same time
[2:43:38] <$RealThiele> 16,000 to work now
[2:43:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> weaver keeps a tight ship
[2:43:41] <%czeekytv> How's the game?
[2:43:43] <%mield916> use grapple for speed
[2:43:44] <%Shackle_Rustyford> gotta earn your air
[2:43:45] <gslayer14> bigger tanks are on the top of the wishlist
[2:43:46] <LSether> BTW is this dudes job to just set there and watch all the cutters O2 meters? lol
[2:43:46] <%Daxalog> Did you ever play the Motherload flash game?
[2:43:51] <+okingjrr> you can upgrade your oxygen with enough monies
[2:43:57] <%Ellila> Pat you absolute fuck. You got me into FF14
[2:43:58] <+koriar> You get upgrades to your oxygen tank, but if it bothers you THAT much you can actually turn it off in the super chill mode
[2:43:59] <%thelaxinator> Give you pain points to alleviate later, like with satisfactory
[2:44:02] <%asgard147> get a better oxygen tank duh 4Head
[2:44:06] <RetributionP> you don't need oxygen it's just a social construct
[2:44:18] <+Sword_of_Stupid> Keep a lookout for refills in the ship
[2:44:19] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> how much?
[2:44:21] <%czeekytv> Get off the shitty Primal DC and maybe I will send you gil
[2:44:22] <NoCreditClear> oxygen is a myth
[2:44:22] <%blaggablag> You can recharge your oxy in pressurized cabins and use that to extend your cutting time if you play it right
[2:44:22] <%Daxalog> What would GIL even buy you?
[2:44:24] <%Chichen> ok i'll give you a bit of gil :)
[2:44:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> When Paige do FF14
[2:44:27] <Mr_Rakjo> Hustle or Scam
[2:44:28] <%Ynkubus_> send pat 1 gil
[2:44:31] <ScreamLord> Wide Cutter is faster for cut points, just aim carefully
[2:44:32] <%maybefalco> pat im too poor to send myself gil
[2:44:35] <$RealThiele> he wants gil for new housing
[2:44:36] <+Tucker0603> fuck you pat I'm gil poor, YOU send me gil
[2:44:37] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> how do i give pat gil
[2:44:38] <%AncelDeLambert> RIGHT?!
[2:44:43] <%blaggablag> Also could you LINE CUT THOSE JESUS CHRIST
[2:44:45] <Zebroneath> I don't owe you SHIT, but thanks for introducing me to 14
[2:44:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA
[2:44:51] <%DianaTheAscian> Find him
[2:44:53] <triggersqueeze1985> Hate hate hate hate
[2:45:01] <%DiscoMatador> Lets you do multiple at a time
[2:45:06] <HellishLancer> You can also cut through soft walls with that
[2:45:14] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Heavy
[2:45:14] <ScreamLord> Heavy
[2:45:21] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt you can do two cut points or more at a time if the objects are within the cutter reticle
[2:45:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> tetjer it
[2:45:31] <Talbat> This game would be absolutely amazing if it featured rescue missions where you have to cut open ships to rescue people or cargo inside. It would make volatile conditions like decompression more interesting too.
[2:45:34] <%vivaldiva> tethers are your friends
[2:45:35] <%sweetestbeefs> they heavy
[2:45:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> t e t h e r
[2:45:42] <%sweetestbeefs> just buy more tethers
[2:45:48] <gslayer14> wait, using a smaller object to push a bigger one works REALLY WELL
[2:45:51] <gslayer14> thats weird
[2:45:55] <+ianabstract> cleaning up after accidents can be satisfying too
[2:45:56] <+thegreenbenis> Tethers are also for sale.
[2:45:59] <NoCreditClear> yes it does
[2:45:59] <yourliteraldog> debt cycle
[2:46:00] <%DiscoMatador> Early on yeah
[2:46:01] <+Strigiform> tethers are your contractually obligated friends
[2:46:02] <+okingjrr> gotta keep you poor
[2:46:02] <yourliteraldog> yay
[2:46:03] <%Shackle_Rustyford> you gotta spend money to spend money
[2:46:04] <%AncelDeLambert> BALLER
[2:46:04] <triggersqueeze1985> Tether that shit space pat
[2:46:05] <%Daxalog> Do you think Weaver gets a kickback from you buying stuff?
[2:46:09] <+koriar> @gslayer14 Yeah it's a weird glitch in the physics engine
[2:46:10] <%the22cstomp> space trucker
[2:46:10] <abelincoln_catpuncher> riiiight
[2:46:17] <%DianaTheAscian> yup
[2:46:22] <abelincoln_catpuncher> space truckiiiiin
[2:46:22] <Zebroneath> good music for honest work
[2:46:23] <tanarath> Welcome to your first 'real' job, Pat.
[2:46:25] <%AncelDeLambert> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:46:25] <aiutare47> Needs harmonica
[2:46:25] <%MelBrooksKA> Space blue grass
[2:46:26] <ToneBacas> hootenanny in spaaaace
[2:46:27] <%twistedj3ster> there was another space game that had this kind of music
[2:46:27] <%blaggablag> It's also dynamic! The danger version is excellent
[2:46:28] <%Movemeister> eekum bokum
[2:46:28] <%CoffeeKaiju> heck yea
[2:46:29] <%brickwall35> very old video
[2:46:30] <%sweetestbeefs> ITS SO GOOD
[2:46:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> I did
[2:46:30] <+thegreenbenis> Yes.
[2:46:33] <+Xalgar> that is cool as fuck
[2:46:33] <%Agami23> yeah that shit is nuts
[2:46:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its awesome
[2:46:34] <%asgard147> yep, just like real life limesOwo ..... limesCry
[2:46:36] <SparkAfterDark> As a metal sculptor that primarily uses found and scavenged material,  this game is literally making my mouth water
[2:46:37] <+Twinmin> Yea its the boys in Valheim
[2:46:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ye
[2:46:37] <triggersqueeze1985> It’s goddamn amazing isn’t it?
[2:46:38] <%Valdorick> They all lift together
[2:46:41] <ScreamLord> Something about country music just fits the blue collar space worker so well
[2:46:41] <LVL1_Scumbag> Railroad workers?
[2:46:46] <DestroPrime83> yeah reminds me of the one scene from the Hobbit with the dwarves
[2:46:46] <tanarath> correct
[2:46:51] <+terraspan> What about being a CEO?
[2:46:52] <%vaporousTippler> Have you not been to the DMV?
[2:46:52] <%MidnightBurst12> FACTS
[2:46:55] <%brickwall35> there is most certainly unskilled labor what are you talking about
[2:47:00] <%Shackle_Rustyford> people do this literal job your playing as a game right now in bangladesh
[2:47:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Skillz
[2:47:02] <tanarath> But there is unorganized labour
[2:47:06] <+chaumiester> .......... What about moving a box from Point A to point B.... Does that count as unskilled labor?
[2:47:06] <%Chichen> those fingers werent needed then
[2:47:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> GOOD
[2:47:08] <T_Sasquatch> No , there's absolutely unskilled labor
[2:47:09] <%AncelDeLambert> college isn't the only path in life, kids, consider and weigh all options
[2:47:10] <%the22cstomp> unskilled labor is a myth made up by rich capitalists in order to suppress the lower class
[2:47:10] <%twistedj3ster> You haven't been to enough mechanics
[2:47:13] <jorniev> my uncle alsmost lost his hand
[2:47:13] <owazowski> BASED PAT
[2:47:14] <%Pappajimbo> hed walk it off
[2:47:16] <SparkAfterDark> streaming?
[2:47:16] <aiutare47> @screamlord A lot of early country and folk was about coal mining
[2:47:16] <Talbat> I think the country music somehow fits the corporate contexts of this game super well too.
[2:47:17] <+thegreenbenis> You've got 10 of them.
[2:47:19] <%Daxalog> Its a very depressing job
[2:47:20] <+koriar> I have about 100 hours in this game, it's amazing to just chill out and watch a stream
[2:47:23] <%AncelDeLambert> The Cost of Concordia! GET THAT BELL!
[2:47:23] <%wibbwobbler> can't help but agree
[2:47:23] <Zebroneath> skilled labor to a rythynm is great
[2:47:26] <AdmiralButtloaf> music is cool until lyrics are added. Lyrics can ruin a great rhythm
[2:47:26] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[2:47:28] <BackflipCharm> There's no unskilled labor. Just unskilled laborers.
[2:47:28] <+Deekman> go watch the latest internet historian.
[2:47:31] <%Jekado> like the costa condordia? psaSmug
[2:47:31] <+D00msDayDan> real shipbreakers have played this game and been like oh yeah this is just like my job
[2:47:31] <%Mr_Pylon> DLC to salvage the Concordia
[2:47:35] <jorniev> my uncle cut 3 of his fingers
[2:47:37] <%MisterRockett> We learned about Ship Salvaging on the most recent Internet Historian video!
[2:47:38] <%Daxalog> Explain: Gold Salvaging
[2:47:40] <NoCreditClear> huck it all into the furnace!
[2:47:43] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt tell me about gold salvaging i know nothign
[2:47:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuuuuuck that shit
[2:47:44] <+chaumiester> I'm sorry, how did we get to this topic of skilled and unskilled labor?
[2:47:44] <NoCreditClear> yeet that shit
[2:47:45] <%brickwall35> we've both worked retail, Pat. it's 100% unskilled labor.
[2:47:46] <%KineticZen> Get cuttin
[2:47:47] <+Plus_On_Black> fingers lost is wisdom gain
[2:47:48] <jorniev> he got better
[2:47:48] <iosephe> there are cutpoints tho
[2:47:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Give one example of unskilled labor, I dare you XD
[2:47:48] <+TheCrispyBoi> why
[2:47:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:47:56] <NoCreditClear> That's 90% aluminum
[2:47:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Time to cut
[2:47:58] <$RealThiele> you can melt most pc components down with acid for gold its nasty but ive seen people do it
[2:48:00] <+ianabstract> cut da cut points
[2:48:00] <gslayer14> cut em off then
[2:48:01] <%Shackle_Rustyford> its just as dystopian too
[2:48:03] <triggersqueeze1985> Have to make Sacrifices son
[2:48:03] <%sweetestbeefs> cut da bottom
[2:48:07] <+Opal_Overture> @PatStaresAt FUCKING CUTPOINTS YOU BLIND BITCH
[2:48:08] <xbb1024> there are different levels of skills. for example, training a computer to recognize a picture of a house
[2:48:09] <%thelaxinator> I once watched a 20 minute special on sifting garbage with magnets to salvage gold. But gold isn't magnetic so it was just hoping you'd get some metal with gold attached...
[2:48:10] <T_Sasquatch> @xerosigmaprime twitch streaming Kappa
[2:48:11] <%brickwall35> @xerosigmaprime retail. source: worked retail
[2:48:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's more gold in poop then there is in the national reserve
[2:48:13] <SparkAfterDark> @xerosigmaprime telemarketers
[2:48:13] <%asgard147> then cut limesOwo
[2:48:21] <ScreamLord> You can also Tether multiple parts together and then tether 1 piece to wherever to process them all at once
[2:48:23] <%AncelDeLambert> anyone know the calculations? Is the buzzsaw cheaper to use than the point laser?
[2:48:25] <+okingjrr> you can, don't worry
[2:48:25] <%Gogogolem> i am trying to think of an actual job that doesn't take some kind of skill.
[2:48:27] <triggersqueeze1985> You don’t even really need your pinky honestly
[2:48:28] <%Gogogolem> i got nothing.
[2:48:33] <%G_Thunders> Apparently this was supposed to come out for PS4 as well? There’s a bunch of gameplay trailers from last year then they just never announced a date
[2:48:35] <tanarath> @patstaresat the tutorial suggest that you cut the ship apart first before you toss the reactor.
[2:48:37] <+koriar> so the game SAYS "penalty applied" if you put it in the wrong place, but it's actually just opportunity cost
[2:48:38] <+chaumiester> Oh great. Pat just started a skilled vs unskilled labor war.
[2:48:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gold salvaging iirc is opening old electronics to salvage gold used in compenents. usualy exposes you to nasty shit in electornics
[2:48:50] <%blaggablag> Do NOT YEET THE WHOLE SHIP INTO THE FURNACE
[2:48:50] <%thelaxinator> Magnet Fishing is really dangerous and people in europe blow up bombs in lakes sometimes by accident.
[2:48:50] <+allups> life before deadspace happened
[2:48:51] <%brickwall35> @gogogolem retail
[2:48:59] <%czeekytv> A skilled laborer will do much more work than an unskilled one in every job, period
[2:49:00] <KShirahama> even small red lights are ment for barge
[2:49:02] <anAngryHamster> If a vet can go a job better than some jagov who just walked in off the street then it's not unskilled labor. And that
[2:49:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @brickwall35 Retail is NOT UNSKILLED
[2:49:10] <+koriar> those door control panels are weirdly highly valued if you put them in the barge
[2:49:10] <abelincoln_catpuncher> magnet fishing??? what??
[2:49:13] <%the22cstomp> retail takes skill that's not true
[2:49:13] <tattleworm> having to strip out chairs and computer terminals and stuff is the finicky stuff, better to just do your reqs and leave the rest
[2:49:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> 24k
[2:49:17] <+fancypan> You can also tether the pannels together, then just use 1 tether to pull them all into the processor
[2:49:18] <NoCreditClear> there's also an upgrade so that you gain O2 in pressurized ships.
[2:49:19] <$RealThiele> byee panel
[2:49:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:49:24] <+Twinmin> You can always leave this ship and go for a more valuable one
[2:49:24] <+InvaderSnarf> Hey Pat, for the cut points like those using the alternative cutting mode is more useful so you do not overcut into the pieces you are trying to salvage
[2:49:29] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt later on, these ships will be PACKED wth oxy and fuel packs, you'll almost never need to buy by then
[2:49:30] <+okingjrr> hopefully they can make it more worth it in later updates
[2:49:31] <+BEARvsCHILD> Is this new among us update?
[2:49:34] <+Katohearts> 100% isn't worth it because 10 bucks for 20 is a bad trade
[2:49:36] <%KineticZen> imagine breathing
[2:49:37] <Scorchfield> also some pieces are worth a lot more, like reactors really are the big ticket item on most ships
[2:49:37] <%asgard147> workin' man workin' hard

[2:49:43] <+thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt You're cutting with a hatchet not a scalpel .
[2:49:43] <%BoxNavy> amogus......
[2:49:47] <tattleworm> @PatStaresAt try grappling the level geometry and reeling yourself in to get around faster
[2:49:52] <stardustcrusad3r> a m o g u s
[2:49:52] <SaltyAzteca> OXYGEN, SMOXYGEN
[2:49:55] <SparkAfterDark> this game but in vr with revengeance cut tech
[2:49:55] <+chaumiester> This is a Gundam SEED joke. The Coordinators VS Naturals War
[2:49:56] <$RealThiele> 24000 to work
[2:49:56] <%blaggablag> s t a t i s t i c a l l y p r o f i t a b l e
[2:49:56] <%brickwall35> @xerosigmaprime yes it is. takes 0 brain power or physical strength. which is why literally anyone, even with NO SKILLS, can do it
[2:49:56] <%thelaxinator> @abelincoln_catpuncher yeah, basically drag a magnetic anchor over a lake bed and hope you get some salvage. The strength of magnets used are REALLY hazardous if used irresponsibly
[2:49:57] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Happy Mar10 day yall
[2:50:00] <+cafefunk> I dont think unskilled labor is a thing, even if your job is just stacking boxes, theres a difference between neatly stacked, organized boxes, and messy, chaotic stacking
[2:50:03] <ScreamLord> You can Tether multiple parts together and then tether 1 piece to wherever to process them all at once. You see a guy do that in the intro CGI
[2:50:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you think there's no skill involved in working retail, you must not have worked retail for very long.
[2:50:11] <NoCreditClear> You woldn't need to breath if you were a perfect metal sphere like your heart truly desires
[2:50:13] <%mield916> pat, hit M2 after grappling something
[2:50:16] <%G_Thunders> In the grand scheme of things how much is the 8k credit refill? Like, literally nothing?
[2:50:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Breathing? On company time!?
[2:50:19] <+Kaskin820> youll be cutting mackerals for a while
[2:50:23] <%vaporousTippler> All the depleting meters say it's No Man's Sky, but with recycling.
[2:50:25] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @thelaxinator dude that's freaking wicked as hell
[2:50:26] <%KineticZen> Big brain daisy chain
[2:50:32] <%the22cstomp> @brickwall35 bullshit patience is a skill and downplaying it is some big shit
[2:50:33] <spothydra0> @PatStaresAt Grappling to the HAB can save you some time
[2:50:35] <%brickwall35> @cafefunk it doesn't take skill to nearly stack boxes. that's just doing an unskilled job well or not
[2:50:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> thats when the good chemicals hit
[2:50:45] <Rionxgarland> gotta pay to live to work to pay to live to work off that debt
[2:50:49] <$RealThiele> less goblin pieces
[2:51:03] <abelincoln_catpuncher> working retail is quite similar to actual Hell, fun fact
[2:51:04] <+Sword_of_Stupid> Makes tethers more likely to break from spinning be careful
[2:51:06] <+koriar> The line cutter is way more worth it in terms of time, you're only barely penalized for overcutting
[2:51:08] <+PenmanLupine> you would have no limbs left
[2:51:10] <+Kaskin820> the max upgrade for cutter strength in this is bad btw
[2:51:13] <%BoxNavy> you would look cool
[2:51:14] <%brickwall35> @the22cstomp I worked at a gas station next to meth labs. it's not hard to learn patience. not a skill
[2:51:18] <%Lizard0TM> "simple"
[2:51:19] <+Deekman> you'd hate that.
[2:51:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:51:21] <xbb1024> What you do now is a job, Pat.
[2:51:23] <TheFramedWarlock> Become a dwarven shopkeep
[2:51:23] <+koriar> plus with range upgrades you can cut three of those six cuts at once
[2:51:28] <%s_xylocalsingles> unskilled labor doesnt exist
[2:51:30] <Parapattern> No shame in bagging groceries
[2:51:30] <%maenos2> my dream's to run a used book store, myself
[2:51:31] <+kknutson4> a retail manager
[2:51:31] <%asgard147> Pat cuts shit? limesThink
[2:51:31] <redrins> retail pat 2: I am the manager now
[2:51:32] <%czeekytv> @brickwall35 So what makes the difference in the laborer that determines whether you do it well or not
[2:51:32] <$RealThiele> owning a store is actually insanely tough
[2:51:33] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL
[2:51:33] <%brickwall35> LUL
[2:51:34] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt would you have met Paige?

[2:51:36] <+ianabstract> you can pop off the control panels for the airlock and barge em
[2:51:37] <+Deekman> @PatStaresAt imagine someone stole something and you never worked out who did it

[2:52:09] <+terraspan> Hachubby is a korean streamer who recently opened her own convenience store.
[2:52:09] <+koriar> Huh... I have rarely had that tether trick work
[2:52:10] <Garry_Guyface> I have a bachelors degree in chemistry and I've been working on and off through contracting companies, is sucks shit and I am constantly stressed out being a third-class worker. Be happy with your job as an entertainer.
[2:52:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @brickwall35 Retail is literally the combination of janitorial work and PR work together. People who dont have skill in it usually jump from job to job often
[2:52:13] <TheFramedWarlock> Ohhhh that's fucking cool
[2:52:13] <Zudrag> wasting all that aluminum
[2:52:13] <+Knows_Too_Much> I could see Pat as a Dep Clerk, an angry short ginger dep clerk
[2:52:14] <+ianabstract> one of those was regular metal
[2:52:14] <SparkAfterDark> you're not old, it only takes a few years to learn a trade, you could literally just do it right now
[2:52:14] <+thegreenbenis> YEAH
[2:52:15] <%Shackle_Rustyford> please revisit your training lmao
[2:52:18] <Giztech> one was for the furnace

[2:52:21] <+okingjrr> chuck that shit in the furnace
[2:52:22] <%Jekado> the air thing
[2:52:23] <+thegreenbenis> Destoyed a panel
[2:52:23] <jorniev> woooooo god job
[2:52:25] <%Teyaric> They only pay you for things nobody wants to do. All work is WORK because it's boring.

[2:52:28] <%Jekado> the air thing can be pulled off
[2:52:30] <%twistedj3ster> pffft
[2:52:34] <%czeekytv> @brickwall35 Learning how to apply your efforts is a skill I would argue

[2:52:50] <%asgard147> THROW IT IN THE TRASH! TableHere FlipThis
[2:52:54] <%Jekado> the atmospheric regulator can be put in the barge
[2:52:55] <%s_xylocalsingles> @Garry_Guyface thats a real boohoo feel bad for you message and a real aggressive tone, no one forced you to pursue that degree
[2:52:57] <rufus2k2> pat spin it
[2:53:01] <EuropanLamprey> Pat dreams of being he manager so when Karen asks for the manager he can tell her to fuck off
[2:53:03] <%s_xylocalsingles> telling someone to be happy with their job is fucking stupid
[2:53:05] <+InvaderSnarf> You would want to tether the support, not the sides
[2:53:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:53:11] <jorniev> WILLL IT FIT
[2:53:14] <%DianaTheAscian> can u cut it?
[2:53:14] <TheFramedWarlock> Just cut it up Pat
[2:53:14] <+InvaderSnarf> Multiple tethers would make it go faster as well
[2:53:15] <jorniev> ?
[2:53:16] <%thelaxinator> why not just throw the entire ship into the furnace, saves time innit?
[2:53:16] <%brickwall35> @xerosigmaprime a job that anyone can do with no prerequisites inherently has no skill required. a job like a doctor, lawyer, CPA, etc. requires acquired skills and knowledge
[2:53:19] <Scorchfield> tethers break if they don't have a clear line
[2:53:21] <$RealThiele> bonk
[2:53:22] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[2:53:24] <%Shackle_Rustyford> !
[2:53:28] <+koriar> if you use two tethers on either side it'll help it not spin as much and be more stable

[2:54:05] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt how is it going building the space cube?
[2:54:07] <%s_xylocalsingles> theres just what you through yoour own personal lens believe is unskilled and segregate it from skilled labor

[2:54:41] <%brickwall35> @xerosigmaprime I've also worked those positions. they required no skill. which is why I hated most of my coworkers because the only "skill" they needed was work ethic, and they didn't even have that
[2:54:41] <%DiscoMatador> nah that was the tutorial they give you a pass
[2:54:42] <%czeekytv> "my opinion is everyone's reality tho" - @brickwall35
[2:54:43] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe?  Tutorial deaths might not count?
[2:54:44] <tanarath> How did Pat die?
[2:54:47] <EuropanLamprey> So I just got here, what is this game?  Cleaning up your room but in Space?

[2:55:36] <leole11> you can pull off EVERYTHING
[2:55:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @brickwall35 Using your example, ALOT of blue collar work like brick laying requires no skill. I can literally get a job in bricklayer just down my street
[2:55:37] <Laecerelius> Only 998.5 million left!
[2:55:38] <%czeekytv> @brickwall35 you're using anecdotes to support your idea that unskilled labor exists lol

[2:55:51] <+okingjrr> yeah, there's a bunch of little objects to throw in the barge
[2:55:52] <HellishLancer> Pat go to Certification
[2:55:54] <+koriar> so long as you make more than 500k it's all profit
[2:55:54] <yourliteraldog> poverty cycle
[2:55:54] <+Katohearts> You can pull the airlock controls off too
[2:55:55] <Giztech> suit!!!
[2:56:00] <+Katohearts> the lights
[2:56:01] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you'll earn more from bigger ships and later you can buy your equipment, eliminating rental costs
[2:56:02] <+ianabstract> anything that gets highlighted when you run your grapple cursor over it can be removed
[2:56:02] <%Daxalog> Damn
[2:56:04] <+Katohearts> all sorts

[2:56:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @brickwall35 Ill be shit at it, and need to develop skills fast (since theres an expectation that I will develop it), but if I dont, I get the boot
[2:56:16] <+Twinmin> repair kits
[2:56:16] <leole11> buy repair kits in the shop
[2:56:16] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt gotta buy repair kits
[2:56:17] <gslayer14> dont waste em
[2:56:18] <%Mr_Pylon> You need to buy repair kits at the console outside the hab, where you got oxygen.
[2:56:21] <%brickwall35> @czeekytv I'm using personal experience to explain my opinion. you're free to have your opinion.
[2:56:22] <codepoke> you have to get repair kits from in mission
[2:56:27] <Scorchfield> there is an option there in the equipment, look a little harder
[2:56:27] <KShirahama> buy or find repair kits
[2:56:34] <+koriar> Repairs are weird, you have to find or buy the kits DURING the shift, then you hit a button on the upgrade screen
[2:56:35] <NoCreditClear> then view the ship catalog silly
[2:56:39] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> View Catlog

[2:56:53] <%s_xylocalsingles> @brickwall35 that doesnt pass muster when your opinion is trying to categorize what labor is skilled/unskilled
[2:56:57] <%thelaxinator> eat your scraps, nerd
[2:56:58] <NoCreditClear> not being able to buy kits in the hab is fucked up
[2:56:58] <gslayer14> good
[2:57:04] <%s_xylocalsingles> the skills you possess now would be worthless 800 years from now // 800 years in the past
[2:57:06] <%twistedj3ster> yeah, just cut it you coward
[2:57:07] <%heartlesshealer> enjoy
[2:57:07] <+koriar> turns out reactors explode
[2:57:07] <leole11> yes, you have a nuclear reactor
[2:57:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> DOIT
[2:57:09] <%Jekado> explosions make it easier to break down into chunks tho!

[2:57:12] <Garry_Guyface> They're not so bad
[2:57:16] <Snorlax321> good LUL
[2:57:17] <%s_xylocalsingles> "unskilled" labor is defined by societal need and other factors
[2:57:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> BE HARDWORK MAN
[2:57:20] <%s_xylocalsingles> and changes throughout generations
[2:57:20] <%AncelDeLambert> children, no arguing about what work is or is not valid in the chat, momma spank
[2:57:21] <+corrosivePaladin> Its ok youre a clone already so explosions dont matter
[2:57:22] <%Daxalog> Must be because of the reactor
[2:57:24] <yourliteraldog> Unskilled Labor is term used by Economists and Industry Leader to justify people less.
[2:57:28] <%asgard147> NO ONE SAID SALVAGE WAS EASY PAT
[2:57:29] <Jokobeast> @NoCreditClear That frustrates me greatly.
[2:57:30] <%thelaxinator> what is it with mackerals being lethal. This and NieR...
[2:57:32] <triggersqueeze1985> Word
[2:57:32] <%s_xylocalsingles> there is no such thing as unskilled labor as every job that exists requires a certain skill
[2:57:34] <Scorchfield> eh, at least these will be the small easy reactors
[2:57:36] <lonosi55> Does pat like this game???
[2:57:39] <+brickwall35> for everyone responding to me, here's my final comment: "unskilled" = anyone can walk in off the street and do the job. "skilled" means some type of degree/experience/expertise is needed to be able to do the job.
[2:57:40] <%s_xylocalsingles> and its just a term created to poorshame people
[2:57:41] <yourliteraldog> Fuck Economists signed a Sociologist
[2:57:47] <%s_xylocalsingles> "unskilled labor" as a term is fuckign stupid
[2:57:52] <+ianabstract> under ship class is usage, station hopper carries crew, light cargo is a truck etc.
[2:57:52] <tanarath> Press R to go to bigger ships.
[2:57:54] <%s_xylocalsingles> that still requires a skill
[2:57:54] <%DianaTheAscian> the le  is worth the most @PatStaresAt
[2:58:05] <%DappercatEsquire> thruster? i hardly know'er
[2:58:11] <%s_xylocalsingles> youre changing the definition of it to fit your worldview and lived experiences
[2:58:11] <%czeekytv> that's a pretty poor definition bud
[2:58:12] <+Sword_of_Stupid> He gon explode
[2:58:13] <%sweetestbeefs> hey guys, lets watch the funny orb man play vidya games, okay?
[2:58:17] <%s_xylocalsingles> and trying to pass it off as an absolute
[2:58:17] <gslayer14> b a z i n g a
[2:58:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @brickwall35 That is literally the stupidest definition of Unskilled labor I've ever heard
[2:58:20] <%s_xylocalsingles> and lmao thats a shit definition
[2:58:22] <%asgard147> Remember to open all the doors first
[2:58:26] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Now that you passed the bugged as shit tutorial and into the game proper, how do you like it?
[2:58:29] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt first thing first is the nacelles and antennas
[2:58:31] <lonosi55> Ohhh boy
[2:58:33] <+xerotwo> LUL
[2:58:34] <jorniev> OK BUT GOTTA GO FAST
[2:58:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:58:39] <%Frost_Quill> @s_xylocalsingles I agree except in the cases of people who fail upwards.  "He's completely useless but he's related to the boss so...promote him I guess?"
[2:58:39] <Scorchfield> reactor is usually one of the last things, need to clear a path first
[2:58:44] <%thelaxinator> bruh he just made 500k
[2:58:46] <xbb1024> You had to get certifications, so this is skilled labor
[2:58:48] <%brickwall35> @xerosigmaprime it's the reality of what it means 🤷♂️
[2:58:48] <AmericanaRed> psaGib LOOK OUT PAT!!!
[2:58:50] <+InvaderSnarf> Good starting point is to get the ship depressurized and the doors open to space
[2:58:51] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't wait until Pat starts getting ghost ships
[2:58:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> KAY WEAVER
[2:58:57] <+InvaderSnarf> less accidents waiting to happen that way
[2:58:58] <+Katohearts> Time starts now boyo
[2:59:01] <%s_xylocalsingles> @Frost_Quill thats just class dynamics baby been around for millenia
[2:59:06] <%Lizard0TM> LUL
[2:59:07] <PinoProxie> gattaca
[2:59:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> L
[2:59:11] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> unskilled labor is a term invented by news anchors and CEOs to break up the working class full stop
[2:59:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:59:17] <%czeekytv> @brickwall35 Hence why I said "my opinion is everyone's reality" but you didn't like hearing that lol
[2:59:21] <%s_xylocalsingles> ^
[2:59:22] <%thelaxinator> Oh cool, eugenics based job acquisition, this future is getting better all the time
[2:59:24] <+wholehole> You can remove the entire bottom of the ship to make it easier to chuck stuff below
[2:59:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @brickwall35 I guess most metal workers and welding jobs are unskilled. Since ALOT OF EM you can get with literally no experience
[2:59:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> This job was made for you
[2:59:31] <+Kabron3> this is ust htat one episode of Firefly
[2:59:34] <Scorchfield> notice now that there is a time limit on your shift
[2:59:37] <%debugdrawray_> doesnt this game technically take place in the homeworld universe
[2:59:49] <%mield916> pats got 13 min now
[2:59:54] <mield916> lol
[2:59:55] <%crimsonharvest> i can't even think of any labor that you can do with no skill except maybe walking from A to B
[2:59:55] <%Frost_Quill> Is your mind getting uploaded into your clone or is it a new person entirely?
[2:59:56] <%brickwall35> @xerosigmaprime trade work isn't considered unskilled labor
[3:00:01] <NoCreditClear> @debugdrawray_ Unofficially.
[3:00:05] <%DappercatEsquire> @sonofthedeepsouth DRRR DRRR DRRR
[3:00:19] <jorniev> I SAW a video of a guy using pressure to launch the generator straight into the collector
[3:00:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @brickwall35 So you admit your first definition is wrong?
[3:00:38] <grimwire1> and limited tethers
[3:00:43] <%Vyskus> Hi Pat
[3:00:44] <%AncelDeLambert> WILL YOU CHILDREN QUIT?!
[3:00:45] <lonosi55> Is this game free
[3:00:46] <+InvaderSnarf> If the timer is something that bothers you, you can play a mode where they don't put you on one.
[3:00:59] <%SpontaneousC> There's two timers, the technical one of your oxygen, and also the work time The longer you take on a ship it either gives you less money or charges you a fee, I cant remember which
[3:01:04] <%asgard147> That timer's just for the work order, right?
[3:01:04] <+InvaderSnarf> I found it to be much more relaxing and the game I wanted this to be without a timer but all of the environmental dangers
[3:01:05] <%Frost_Quill> Alright now there's a time limit.
[3:01:06] <GarrisonPrime> I really like the space trucker/cowboy vibe of this game
[3:01:09] <%Jekado> FREE OXYGEN
[3:01:16] <%Jekado> and free fuel
[3:01:18] <%Daxalog> GAS
[3:01:19] <%Jekado> don't grab it yet
[3:01:19] <NoCreditClear> thurster fuel for you
[3:01:22] <LastnameSilverLastname> monkaS
[3:01:22] <NoCreditClear> also oxygen
[3:01:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Now chat since we are talking about space things let me explain you why the Cardassians did nothing wrong Kappa
[3:01:22] <%AncelDeLambert> free fuel, free oxygen
[3:01:23] <yourliteraldog> Looks explosive
[3:01:25] <gslayer14> pat
[3:01:27] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt the key is in a semi-random part of the ship
[3:01:28] <+Katohearts> Free sgut'
[3:01:29] <gslayer14> doors first
[3:01:29] <%Jekado> IT EXPODES THO
[3:01:30] <Giztech> open the cockpit
[3:01:30] <%Agami23> neat
[3:01:31] <DrkJP520> it'll be fine
[3:01:32] <+Katohearts> Free shit
[3:01:32] <gslayer14> too late
[3:01:36] <%asgard147> limesS
[3:01:37] <+koriar> I like the timer, otherwise my brain tells me I have to get every single part
[3:01:38] <KShirahama> open all doors first
[3:01:38] <+InvaderSnarf> Look for an AC looking thing, you can depressurize
[3:01:39] <%thelaxinator> pick up the soda cans while you're at it, the deposit adds up
[3:01:39] <%MidnightBurst12> hell yeah free vapors bubble
[3:01:44] <yourliteraldog> Now the cock pit
[3:01:47] <%Jekado> weird how keys are in the early ships but the early ships don't use the key
[3:01:51] <+Twinmin> The cockpit
[3:01:54] <Scorchfield> you can sometimes just find free fuel and O2, it can save you some time
[3:01:55] <NoCreditClear> hey! the crawlspace depressurized this time
[3:01:55] <%sweetestbeefs> now open the cabin
[3:01:57] <+InvaderSnarf> Check the cockpit!
[3:02:00] <+thegreenbenis> Make a way out.
[3:02:03] <HellishLancer> Open all doors
[3:02:28] <+koriar> open up the bottom
[3:02:30] <+Twinmin> Pat if you break the connections in the floor, you can just push them all out
[3:02:31] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Cut bottm
[3:02:33] <+okingjrr> yup
[3:02:36] <yourliteraldog> That seems like a good idea
[3:02:37] <%thelaxinator> This track is a little Mass Effect Galaxy Map vibes on it
[3:02:39] <%Dunmarkh> play the game pat
[3:02:40] <+InvaderSnarf> Careful of the loose fuel, you can make them explode with impacts
[3:02:40] <+thegreenbenis> Yep
[3:02:45] <NoCreditClear> shelling a ship is almost always one of the first things to do.
[3:02:46] <+thegreenbenis> Make you a way out.
[3:03:02] <+wholehole> Take the bottom panels off
[3:03:05] <+InvaderSnarf> You can cut a whole in the bottom, or just plain remove the bottom of the ship, and push things straight down
[3:03:07] <leole11> good job :)
[3:03:11] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt a rectangle flew out of the cabin, go get it
[3:03:13] <%mield916> pick up the data drive behind you
[3:03:15] <BaronVonProlix> id probably worry about structure first, then interior bits
[3:03:15] <Tuna_Can_0> whether its space welding or underwater welding I know I'll never touch that shit even at gun point monkaS
[3:03:19] <%heartlesshealer> decompression of that one area, good job (for real)
[3:03:19] <Rionxgarland> oh shit pats on a time limit
[3:03:26] <%garagon31> If you like decompression you should play Barotrauma.
[3:03:29] <+Katohearts> Open that first yeah
[3:03:31] <+Kaskin820> grab some oxygen from the wall
[3:03:32] <+thegreenbenis> Removing the bottom is recommended.
[3:03:36] <yourliteraldog> Crawl Spaces?
[3:03:40] <Mr_Rakjo> BECOME AS GODS
[3:03:41] <+Kaskin820> ooh its this audio log

[3:05:26] <%sweetestbeefs> cut from the inside
[3:05:27] <+okingjrr> remember to melt the cutpoints
[3:05:27] <+InvaderSnarf> Using the fuel and oxygen canisters in the ship saves you some money
[3:05:28] <+thegreenbenis> Open the floor.
[3:05:32] <PinoProxie> DOGTIEM
[3:05:33] <ScreamLord> Red means explody
[3:05:35] <%BoxNavy> Dog Break

[3:07:56] <ammobasket> Big bork
[3:08:01] <+okingjrr> Pull that out
[3:08:03] <%Frost_Quill> I love dogs.
[3:08:11] <%Evil_John_Cena> barking is loud as shit so be glad he does that instead
[3:08:22] <+thegreenbenis> Remove some panels.
[3:08:29] <%heartlesshealer> @well, hopefully our area will eat it all up and it won't reach you as bad >:
[3:08:34] <+thegreenbenis> Inside.
[3:08:36] <%heartlesshealer> thanks twitch
[3:08:38] <Brandon__Brando> I want a pet so bad but there so expensive
[3:08:39] <%sweetestbeefs> from the inside???
[3:08:42] <%AyotoCorp> There's usually an interior entrance
[3:08:43] <%AncelDeLambert> there is ALWAYS an airlock
[3:08:44] <+Katohearts> Inside pat
[3:08:46] <+thegreenbenis> Do it from inside.
[3:08:47] <+okingjrr> Just melt the cutpoints from inside
[3:08:47] <+fancypan> Things like the thruster and atmo module can be pulled right out
[3:08:48] <tanarath> Inside
[3:08:49] <KShirahama> yes
[3:08:54] <CatsDrunkonCopper> yes
[3:08:55] <leole11> yes
[3:08:56] <%DiscoMatador> Try
[3:08:59] <+Twinmin> you can literally just melt that cap
[3:08:59] <%heartlesshealer> @geminitengu well hopefully we'll eat all of the storm and it won't be as bad when it reaches you
[3:09:01] <+thegreenbenis> Yes.
[3:09:04] <Tuna_Can_0> yes kreygasm
[3:09:05] <%twistedj3ster> just start cutting and find out
[3:09:22] <leole11> it just pops right off
[3:09:27] <Rionxgarland> @PatStaresAt you can disable the shift timer if you want at least thats what i read
[3:09:27] <+geminitengu> @heartlesshealer i guess we do need the rain stay safe from the storm
[3:09:31] <Slim_Lipid> LONG Kreygasm
[3:09:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Oh wow, didn't know you could do that
[3:09:32] <bonebagMEL> not very well set in placed that thruster lol
[3:09:37] <Tuna_Can_0> pull it out Kreygasm
[3:09:50] <%thelaxinator> the total lack of screws in this construction is a little worrying
[3:09:56] <%Jekado> @Rionxgarland yes there is an unlimited time and unlimited oxygen mod
[3:09:56] <%thelaxinator> these ships are built like legos
[3:10:01] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah that timer is too short.  Double it and this game would be super relaxing.
[3:10:07] <+thegreenbenis> Cut the butt off.
[3:10:11] <leole11> you can just pop off that door
[3:10:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Probably a bad idea to try that if the ship is pressurized right?
[3:10:17] <omglaserbeamspewpew> Never use mega bloks in your ship construction, though.
[3:10:20] <%Jekado> red is bad
[3:10:20] <%heartlesshealer> @geminitengu yeah, plus it helps replenish stuff, so there's always that. I just hate the people aspect of rain, especially now that I do deliveries
[3:10:23] <%Jekado> DON"T
[3:10:24] <+Sword_of_Stupid> Watch the laser bounce
[3:10:25] <%sweetestbeefs> big boom
[3:10:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> fuel
[3:10:32] <ScreamLord> Highly explodable fuel tank
[3:10:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> CUT IT
[3:10:45] <%flechet> use the shut off before touching the tanks
[3:10:47] <%sweetestbeefs> 5 minutes pat
[3:10:52] <%Jekado> laser doesn't bounce persay but the cutter does generate heat
[3:10:52] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt You can turn off shift timer by the by in options
[3:10:52] <%thelaxinator> You don't want another billion credits on your debt for throwing a full fuel tank into the furnace?
[3:10:53] <+geminitengu> @heartlesshealer  ooh yeah people drive terribly in the bay area and when it rains its like their drunk most of the time
[3:10:54] <%heartlesshealer> mmmm fuel
[3:11:18] <CatsDrunkonCopper> use the cutter on the fuel tank to disassemble the ship faster
[3:11:19] <%Mr_Pylon> nice
[3:11:20] <TrollKing96> How big can these ships get?
[3:11:22] <%arcielardor> it's amazing how much shit becomes explosive in space
[3:11:29] <leole11> SMOOTH
[3:11:33] <+thegreenbenis> That's ballsy.
[3:11:38] <+ianabstract> like pulling a tooth with a door
[3:11:42] <%Jekado> @TrollKing96 they get fairly large now
[3:11:42] <+geminitengu> Only a pog champ nukes their salvage ship
[3:11:46] <NoCreditClear> @TrollKing96 Pretty big. One of them is so long it barely fits inthe  bay
[3:12:01] <Giztech> slice the butt off
[3:12:02] <Psyramics> @PatStaresAt Work Orders are per ship, not per shift
[3:12:09] <+cafefunk> I feel like the ending of this game is that you pay off the debt and then die
[3:12:21] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt By the by Pat, if the time is too much for you, there's a "Open Shift" difficulty that does away with it.
[3:12:25] <%Frost_Quill> @ianabstract I tried that as a kid.  It wasn't loose enough. BibleThump
[3:12:30] <%TaifuDragon> nanocarbon is big money, peel that ship like an orange
[3:12:32] <+okingjrr> Glass is actually worth a lot on its own
[3:12:32] <%heartlesshealer> @geminitengu same here. Hopefully some of the speed weirdos will hold back, but there's always gonna be something that happens
[3:12:33] <%Jekado> they had to update the barge because you couldn't shove all the stuff on the large ships because onto it.
[3:12:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This music is VERY SUPERGIANT
[3:12:46] <Brandon__Brando> this would be fun in vr
[3:12:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:13:00] <+geminitengu> @heartlesshealer  Amen
[3:13:02] <Rionxgarland> fun and terrifying
[3:13:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> The company equipmemt Pat
[3:13:11] <s1rcuit> @Brandon__Brando it'd be vomit inducing in vr
[3:13:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> athink about
[3:13:25] <lloyddboy> are you STEALING OXYGEN?
[3:13:27] <+Javaa01> Gotta cut it at the top and bottom still
[3:13:36] <%thelaxinator> Damage to FICSIT equipment detected
[3:13:37] <NoCreditClear> The point cutter can melt glass panels pretty easily
[3:13:38] <ScreamLord> Pat how could you steal valuable air from the company like that Kappa
[3:13:44] <%Broand> You think you'll ever do an entire ship in one shift?
[3:13:48] <%G_Thunders> Stealing company property smh
[3:13:54] <+thegreenbenis> Peel it like an orange to get at the innards. @PatStaresAt
[3:13:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's company air you're freeloading there bud
[3:13:56] <%Jekado> you can peel off the door handles too
[3:14:13] <%heartlesshealer> time to roll
[3:14:17] <%heartlesshealer> or do that
[3:14:18] <%Broand> you can remove the chairs too
[3:14:58] <%G_Thunders> I’m surprised they didn’t remark on how your oxygen tank magically refilled there
[3:15:09] <%Jekado> just keep working
[3:15:14] <BaronVonProlix> CRASH FEAR
[3:15:14] <bonebagMEL> that was a close one
[3:15:19] <%Jekado> you dont' have to turn it they auto do it for you
[3:15:21] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:15:22] <xbb1024> you will be doing unpaid overtime
[3:15:32] <NoCreditClear> you can run the clock out
[3:15:38] <+InvaderSnarf> Have they fixed the bug where things wig out when grappled?
[3:15:40] <bonebagMEL> Lol Paige sounds like a bird
[3:15:40] <KShirahama> just keep working
[3:15:41] <NoCreditClear> it'll bring you back automatically
[3:15:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> The pull stuff towards you is really aggressive
[3:15:44] <%Jekado> you can run out the clock
[3:15:46] <+ianabstract> you don't need to return manually
[3:15:47] <+geminitengu> you can run the clock out lmaooo
[3:15:47] <+ElectricHoodie> you don't have to go back to the barge at the end, it'll just end for you
[3:15:47] <%thelaxinator> speed tech
[3:15:48] <+Walopoh> Clap
[3:15:49] <%AzureGale> Pro moves
[3:15:50] <BaronVonProlix> fuckin dived right through the door
[3:15:51] <%Broand> you don't have to return by hand

[3:16:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> killed yourself
[3:16:04] <%heartlesshealer> good job
[3:16:09] <Giztech> buy a better suit
[3:16:11] <+geminitengu> DEMO CHARGES
[3:16:14] <tanarath> it WAS cool
[3:16:23] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt As a reminder, if you don't want the timer then the "Open Shift" difficulty gets away with it.
[3:16:31] <+Kaskin820> demo charges are a later thing
[3:16:34] <%AzureGale> They charge you for game demos now
[3:16:36] <NoCreditClear> increase ocygen and tether counts lol
[3:16:37] <%Jekado> Demo Charges are fun... but also very dangerious
[3:16:59] <%Frost_Quill> You buy the ability to hear, lol.
[3:17:05] <hairtoday> oh my the game has patches that reset your settings, i hate that
[3:17:06] <%Jekado> increase tethers is always good
[3:17:09] <Brandon__Brando> @thelaxinator  I get it it could take the G's that are required for a spaceship
[3:17:10] <leole11> grapple strength is high priority, imo
[3:17:11] <%sweetestbeefs> STINGER??
[3:17:13] <%Jekado> since when you refill it refills full
[3:17:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> BREAKDOWN
[3:17:19] <%heartlesshealer> baby grandpa <3
[3:17:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> ELMO
[3:17:30] <+Kaskin820> not more oxygen?
[3:17:31] <%sweetestbeefs> HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH BREAKDOWN
[3:17:35] <+thegreenbenis> That's a weird one to get.
[3:17:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Wants attention
[3:17:55] <%Jekado> sometimes its not worth going back
[3:18:22] <%Jekado> you have to repair gear at the hab
[3:18:27] <+geminitengu> Scanner needs repair
[3:18:29] <%Jekado> not while at work for some reason
[3:18:34] <Gragnack> i love this game so much
[3:18:36] <%DiscoMatador> Check the ship and see if there is a repair kit in there
[3:18:37] <%sweetestbeefs> it's at 75 percent, you're still good
[3:18:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:18:38] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you can also find repair kits in ships
[3:18:40] <+Shacklebox> That sucks ass
[3:18:40] <bonebagMEL> Buen provecho Paige
[3:18:41] <%Broand> yeah the name of the game is getting everything that's valuable as fast as possible
[3:18:49] <%emperordread> Just relax your eyes Gohan
[3:18:49] <tanarath> Pat, you can be find repair kits & upgrade parts inside ships
[3:18:49] <%thelaxinator> This game is doing it's damnedest to fight the comfy
[3:18:52] <xcompleasedad> You poor, bro. It's great mjbNice
[3:18:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAY FOR COMPANY PROPERTY LUL
[3:18:56] <%Broand> Interior walls are cuttable
[3:18:57] <+TheCrispyBoi> it'ss a hard life being a shipbraker
[3:18:59] <+ianabstract> all your gear was produced by the lowest bidder, can you tell?
[3:19:00] <+thegreenbenis> CUTE FLOOR
[3:19:03] <+thegreenbenis> Cut floor.
[3:19:05] <%TaifuDragon> cut points
[3:19:07] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> i appreciate how much they gamified the oppressive feeling but the fact of the matter is your debt.... honestly doesnt matter a whole lot?
[3:19:07] <%sweetestbeefs> detach the back section so you can get into the crawlspaces?
[3:19:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Jekado Work time is for scrapping only, time is money and all that
[3:19:20] <%flechet> The realest working man, yelling at busted tools
[3:19:40] <ScreamLord> Some of the best paying jobs in the world are also the most dangerous. A fishing team can provide for the families comfortably for a year with only a few big ass Tuna fish
[3:19:40] <%thelaxinator> tis a poor craftsman who blames his tools
[3:19:42] <%Broand> Also cut the points you can see on the ground, there's no crawlspace on the floor, so the floor will just fall off
[3:19:45] <%Jekado> @ReallyBigRocks yeah pretty much its annoying because you can only buy repair things while at work
[3:19:51] <%AzureGale> Clank
[3:19:52] <NoCreditClear> it's a light
[3:19:55] <huskarl_zap> Woolie starBOARD NO THE OTHER STARBOARD
[3:20:01] <%Broand> It's a light
[3:20:58] <%Mr_Pylon> it's BIG heavy
[3:20:59] <+okingjrr> it's just too heavy, use a tether
[3:21:00] <KShirahama> nah, HEAVY
[3:21:06] <%sweetestbeefs> tether it?
[3:21:08] <NoCreditClear> way heavy
[3:21:09] <+thegreenbenis> JUST HEAVY
[3:21:10] <BaronVonProlix> tether dat bish
[3:21:15] <+thegreenbenis> TETHER,
[3:21:23] <%sweetestbeefs> there ya go
[3:21:27] <%Mr_Pylon> Once your grapple strength is better you can see things shift more
[3:21:29] <+ianabstract> the hud shows how much what you are looking at weighs
[3:21:30] <%DappercatEsquire> see you later, space wage slave
[3:21:38] <+LordSDB> I thought pat was gonna toss the whole ship in there for a second LUL
[3:21:40] <+ianabstract> if it weighs as much as the whole ship, it's still attached
[3:21:44] <NoCreditClear> When you grapple something it'll give you the weight. use that to guage if it's attached
[3:21:48] <%sweetestbeefs> was that attached to nothing?
[3:22:02] <%Broand> Shoot the cutpoints on the floor, the floor will just fall right off
[3:22:06] <Mr_Rakjo> LUL
[3:22:07] <NoCreditClear> lol
[3:22:09] <Mr_Rakjo> That was CLose
[3:22:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> oof
[3:22:10] <LoreKeeper_Thal> LUL
[3:22:11] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[3:22:13] <HellishLancer> I just clenched
[3:22:14] <Scorchfield> coolant
[3:22:15] <%aishman> Coolant
[3:22:16] <+thegreenbenis> OOOOH BOY
[3:22:16] <%Jekado> that... would of sucked
[3:22:16] <Mr_Rakjo> Oof
[3:22:18] <Gragnack> money in the bank is what that is
[3:22:19] <PinoProxie> lol
[3:22:20] <%AzureGale> That is deth
[3:22:21] <%Jekado> if you cut through that
[3:22:21] <bonebagMEL> Don't drink it! I know it's sweet but don't drink it
[3:22:23] <NoCreditClear> almost a big bad
[3:22:23] <KShirahama> coolant
[3:22:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> TEMPERATURE
[3:22:29] <+thegreenbenis> OH SHIT OH FUCK
[3:22:31] <xcompleasedad> Cut it off?
[3:22:31] <ScreamLord> I love how the control switch for doors is just magnetically clipped to the wall with no wiring attaching it to anything whatsoever
[3:22:32] <%asgard147> coolent tank
[3:22:37] <huskarl_zap> Clearly the snowmaker
[3:22:39] <xcompleasedad> Never mind LUL
[3:22:40] <PinoProxie> pat is getting the real industrial labor experience
[3:22:40] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt don't bump it too much, it'll break
[3:22:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> the goddamn coolant
[3:22:43] <Giztech> oh that's why this game is great the reactions to random shit appearing that could kill you
[3:22:44] <+impressionistcowboy> ooh sooth
[3:22:59] <%aishman> This is such a comfy game holy fuck
[3:23:04] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt That's a coolant tank, you can actually use that to make harder materials easier to cut
[3:23:07] <%Jekado> GOD if this was an earlier version of the game it would of exploded
[3:23:25] <%blaggablag> :D now you're getting into it
[3:23:38] <Scorchfield> take stuff out the bigger holes, less likely to damage stuff
[3:23:44] <NoCreditClear> many a good memory of getting splatted from picking up breaker cells
[3:23:59] <huskarl_zap> jojo
[3:24:05] <+impressionistcowboy> dang pats really improved being a space cowboy
[3:24:42] <Sotetsu> You're all set if necromorphs show up.
[3:24:51] <+okingjrr> saved
[3:24:56] <NoCreditClear> Once you get good enough that breaking even on every shift isn't a concern, it's a very zen game.
[3:25:04] <%TaifuDragon> if you just get the nanocarbon off you can throw the rest into the furnace whole
[3:25:11] <BaronVonProlix> @Sotetsu Yeah that laser cutter is giving me PTSD
[3:25:19] <%Broand> The bigger ships wreck my head
[3:25:30] <DrkJP520> Is that the plasma cutter?
[3:25:33] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[3:25:35] <+impressionistcowboy> wait how big do ships get?
[3:25:50] <Scorchfield> its so much easier if you just open the floor panels
[3:26:03] <NoCreditClear> @impressionistcowboy One of them barely fits inthe bay it's so long
[3:26:03] <leole11> @impressionistcowboy they barely fit in the hangar
[3:26:05] <BaronVonProlix> id love to just spend a week on a capital ship for like an hour every day
[3:26:05] <lamash7u> Typically on these ships I start with the back and do the front last.
[3:26:10] <%blaggablag> @impressionistcowboy As big as the whole yard
[3:26:13] <+impressionistcowboy> oh fug
[3:26:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> use the other mode for those lmao
[3:26:21] <%heartlesshealer> plasma cutter and rail cutter
[3:26:28] <%AzureGale> This music bops
[3:26:33] <%blaggablag> There's a cargo freighter model that's basically touching the HAB towards the end
[3:26:39] <%Broand> I usually yank out the floor and roof and then work backwards to front
[3:26:44] <+impressionistcowboy> idk using the line cutter on everything is very exciting
[3:26:57] <+Sword_of_Stupid> OSHA requests your location
[3:26:57] <+Deekman> I'm off to buy this sound track. It's so relaxing
[3:26:59] <huskarl_zap> >Destroying blessed hull of the omnissiah instead of refurbishing it
[3:27:01] <%Jekado> i usually remove all the outside plates first
[3:27:05] <%Jekado> then work with internasl
[3:27:05] <+ianabstract> you can barge the emergency lighting, but it's not worth the time
[3:27:07] <%Broand> unless I'm strapped in which case I grab as many valuables as I can
[3:27:17] <huskarl_zap> CYBORG SCREACHING
[3:27:23] <+TheMorilo> How stressful is to manage your oxygen in this game?
[3:27:23] <%shruke> yknow what would be sick, this with big mechs and gundams
[3:27:25] <%TaifuDragon> computers
[3:27:31] <%Fien111> The choice of music for this game is perfect
[3:27:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> yo look at all them chairs
[3:27:40] <NoCreditClear> oxygen becomes mostly an afterthought after a few hours
[3:27:48] <%Jekado> @TheMorilo not very since you can upgrade the length
[3:27:52] <s1rcuit> @shruke that would be cool
[3:27:54] <+impressionistcowboy> hahah now I'm imagining a mechanicus version of this game we're you have to bless each individual part
[3:27:57] <%Jekado> also there is usualy free oxygen
[3:28:00] <NoCreditClear> Even if you hit zero O2 you'll still just bleed health while you gasp for air as you fly back home
[3:28:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> wow this music
[3:28:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> work faster wagie
[3:28:19] <BaronVonProlix> @impressionistcowboy toasters go in the SAVE FOR LATER box
[3:28:23] <%heartlesshealer> gonna love if pat accidentally grabs fuel and bumps his face with it
[3:28:36] <%Jekado> the only real killer in this game is inefficency and explosions
[3:28:46] <leole11> you CAN bump so fast onto your helmet that it breaks
[3:28:47] <%Fien111> @impressionistcowboy The Machine Spirit of the chair is angry and curses you with a lumpy ride all the way to Terra!
[3:28:53] <+impressionistcowboy> @impressionistcowboy not sure a game with that feature is safe for work
[3:29:02] <%heartlesshealer> psaGib
[3:29:05] <%debugdrawray_> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[3:29:13] <%TaifuDragon> bad reactor pulls can end a job completely
[3:29:14] <%Gamblitz> Ahh yeah Homeworld .001
[3:29:30] <huskarl_zap> Chair spirits are very easy to make mad
[3:29:32] <Sotetsu> Oooh, Whataburger
[3:29:38] <Jaysky> 👍
[3:29:50] <+Deekman> with this level of space tech you'd think a robot would be more cost effective to do this shit
[3:30:05] <HellishLancer> you can just pull it off
[3:30:09] <+geminitengu> ai are  banne din this universe
[3:30:11] <leole11> oh no
[3:30:13] <%Jekado> there should... be a safey switch?
[3:30:15] <lamash7u> Take the hull portion off first.
[3:30:17] <%heartlesshealer> a box :3
[3:30:17] <xbb1024> we going boom?
[3:30:18] <+impressionistcowboy> oooh
[3:30:18] <%Jekado> i forget on these
[3:30:20] <+impressionistcowboy> ioooooooohg
[3:30:25] <%heartlesshealer> OH BOY
[3:30:28] <NoCreditClear> Not at this difficulty
[3:30:30] <%thelaxinator> nice butt clench there
[3:30:31] <%Fien111> Robots lack the casual evil of making a human die for your profit margins, though
[3:30:33] <%Frost_Quill> @Deekman They wouldn't be able to charge the robot half a million credits per day for just being there probably.
[3:30:35] <%heartlesshealer> yeyeye smooth
[3:30:36] <NoCreditClear> flush levers are later
[3:30:36] <+ianabstract> butt clenched
[3:30:38] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! How's the M+Kb control for the game?  When I played at PAX the devs said that controller is the preferred way to play for most of them.
[3:30:38] <%Jekado> yeah removing fuel gets.... harry
[3:30:46] <%Jekado> there is one where its a refueling tanker...
[3:30:56] <%Gamblitz> @Deekman them Unions man. gotta make sure a meat is on the helm
[3:31:11] <lamash7u> Lights aren't worth the effort to salvage.
[3:31:17] <+ianabstract> the fuel tanker ship is a real white knuckle job
[3:31:19] <leole11> LMAO THE LIGHTS
[3:31:21] <zedravan> everything that is not nailed to the ground
[3:31:33] <%DakotaMacDoodle> man this game has a good vibe to it
[3:31:34] <NitronStreams> 🎵🎵🎵🎵
[3:31:39] <%Broand> get the atmos
[3:31:42] <NoCreditClear> I hope he looks at howe much they're worth in the report LUL
[3:31:52] <huskarl_zap> voice sound familiar
[3:31:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> work himself out of that debt
[3:32:01] <s1rcuit> @NoCreditClear somehow I don't think he will
[3:32:09] <%heartlesshealer> a couple fuel units
[3:32:14] <%heartlesshealer> and those boxes
[3:32:18] <%brickwall35> 15 seconds Pat
[3:32:22] <Scorchfield> i look forward to seeing how he decides to handle the bigger ships
[3:32:28] <huskarl_zap> Kotor 2 tutorial women voice
[3:32:29] <%Aeoneth> I feel like Pat's about to make me buy a game again
[3:32:33] <xcompleasedad> Does he die if the shift ends and he's not back home?
[3:32:35] <%Jekado> grab the med kit
[3:32:36] <%heartlesshealer> goodbye salvage
[3:32:41] <xcompleasedad> Nope
[3:32:42] <%Jekado> it just heals
[3:32:54] <NoCreditClear> 9 lights for 5k units LUL
[3:32:55] <s1rcuit> @Aeoneth lol, it do be like that sometimes
[3:33:02] <NoCreditClear> REPAIR
[3:33:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> Lights aint worth shit
[3:33:06] <%Jekado> yeah it just boots you out so just work until your shift ends
[3:33:07] <%thelaxinator> no reactor core for the beefy pay cheque
[3:33:08] <s1rcuit> told you
[3:33:10] <+aishman> Continue?!
[3:33:11] <%Broand> augh
[3:33:18] <%heartlesshealer> 15 lynx tokens
[3:33:24] <$apolitenoob> Tethers
[3:33:26] <%Mr_Pylon> yeah buy a bunch of repair kits
[3:33:27] <%Jekado> repair kits fix gear
[3:33:28] <+corrosivePaladin> why do you keep going back to the ship youve already stripped?
[3:33:37] <tanarath> @deekman drones would be more effective.
[3:33:37] <+thegreenbenis> You really don't need to continue once you scooped all the meat out.
[3:33:39] <%Jekado> yeah you need some repair kits
[3:33:40] <%aishman> Why don't you just get a new ship?
[3:33:41] <%Gamblitz> Imagine Shipbreaking the Progenitor Mothership
[3:33:45] <%Jekado> i just buy a ton
[3:33:54] <xbb1024> to 100 percent it
[3:33:55] <tanarath> But using stuff like this is 'cheaper'
[3:33:56] <lamash7u> He's not even half-way done with the ship.
[3:33:57] <%Jekado> its actually just skin and bones
[3:33:58] <%TaifuDragon> to get the GUTS
[3:33:59] <NoCreditClear> Pat want that 100% use the whole buffalo run
[3:33:59] <%rkbinder> its grissel
[3:33:59] <%Mr_Pylon> there's plenty of meat left in this gym mat
[3:34:00] <%Jekado> all the meat is gone
[3:34:01] <NitronStreams> THE ENTIRE BUFFALO
[3:34:02] <+thegreenbenis> You got the meat, that's all shell.
[3:34:02] <+fancypan> You might lose money on this day
[3:34:03] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt The big money is in the reactor and the shit you already pulled off, this is just...fat.
[3:34:03] <%sweetestbeefs> gotta get rid of all of it
[3:34:03] <+Brightstreak> This music is perfect
[3:34:03] <Scorchfield> except what is left isn't worth it
[3:34:06] <leole11> DAMN RIGHT
[3:34:09] <+Javaa01> This ain't meat, this is cartilage
[3:34:12] <BaronVonProlix> WHOLE BUFFALO
[3:34:13] <%Jekado> the meat is the reactor
[3:34:15] <leole11> 0% ALL THE BUFFALO
[3:34:15] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> THE WHOLE BUFFALO
[3:34:18] <%TaifuDragon> bs
[3:34:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> so @patstaresat how's it feel being a cog in the industrialists machine
[3:34:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> He gotta finish his work
[3:34:23] <%asgard147> Can't eat your pudding if you don't eat your meat
[3:34:26] <%Jekado> nah nanocarbon is still worth money
[3:34:27] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt don't worry about electronics/luggage unless you have a work order specifically asking for them
[3:34:27] <ammobasket> Not stripped yet!
[3:34:28] <tanarath> Gobolins
[3:34:29] <+ianabstract> you can use the splitsaw to cut multiple cut points at once
[3:34:29] <luteboy456> you gotta clean the whole thang
[3:34:29] <%aishman> And you're just having fun
[3:34:33] <BaronVonProlix> IN THIS HOUSE WE FINISH THE WHOLE PLATE
[3:34:33] <+thegreenbenis> Eh just let him finish
[3:34:34] <%Jekado> nano is work some dosh
[3:34:34] <%sweetestbeefs> DA WHOLE FRIGGIN BUFFALO BAYBEE
[3:34:36] <%TaifuDragon> metal and nano is fine money
[3:34:37] <$tehbeardedbard> all of it has value you should have almost nothing left when you are " done with a ship "
[3:34:37] <%vivaldiva> haul all that salvage back to your wagon damn it
[3:34:39] <%Theo_Marks> BUFFALO TIME
[3:34:39] <%thelaxinator> eh, what's a few hundred thousand dollars more debt
[3:34:39] <+ianabstract> makes cleaning off those side panels a snap
[3:34:39] <luteboy456> eat your whole plate
[3:34:40] <%Fien111> Rip Paige
[3:34:40] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:34:41] <%twistedj3ster> when has chat ever steered you wrong though?
[3:34:41] <%Jekado> is paige okay?
[3:34:41] <%heartlesshealer> pat does need to see earn to cost at least once
[3:34:42] <NoCreditClear> I think the nano panels can still bring him over the limit
[3:34:43] <SaltyAzteca> Gon strip that buffalo to the na-PAIGE?
[3:34:44] <%Frost_Quill> Finish your steak Pat, don't let the haters tell you otherwise.
[3:34:44] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> PAIGE IS DEAD 🦀
[3:34:46] <%Arkfyre> monkaS
[3:34:50] <%heartlesshealer> HMMMM
[3:34:51] <%asgard147> monkaS
[3:34:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> and she's dead
[3:34:53] <%vivaldiva> psaBig psaRaffle
[3:34:54] <%Broand> The fun part is when you salvage the entire ship in 1 shift
[3:34:54] <ScreamLord> Y'know USUALLY it's the COMPANY'S responsibility to provide most of those things you're paying for and the employee only has to spend money on the company if they break a thing
[3:34:55] <%BinaryFireball> *continues playing*
[3:34:56] <PinoProxie> paige is breaking her own ship
[3:34:57] <+fancypan> Learning? Through experience? Unacceptable
[3:34:59] <%walternatorz> Pat is letting the southern twang affect his speech
[3:35:02] <%Evil_John_Cena> paige just stopped something horrible happening by sacrificing her brushed nickel collinder
[3:35:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> DEATH
[3:35:05] <+thegreenbenis> Paige is fucking dead
[3:35:07] <%thelaxinator> nope
[3:35:12] <%asgard147> SHE'S FUCKIN' DEAD limesCry
[3:35:18] <%BinaryFireball> nope
[3:35:20] <%averyoddjew> averyoddjew subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! pet the babies
[3:35:22] <luteboy456> aw man not again
[3:35:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Good jorb
[3:35:24] <BaronVonProlix> it only aint valuable if you dont take it !
[3:35:28] <%Jekado> yeah tethers are fucking fragile
[3:35:28] <%heartlesshealer> you probably wanted to grab the middle one
[3:35:34] <xbb1024> you're not saving tethers by doing that
[3:35:34] <%Jekado> you really need to upgrade them and still
[3:35:42] <NoCreditClear> you'll eventually have like 30 to 40 tethers
[3:35:44] <+okingjrr> yeah, it's LOS
[3:35:45] <%Jekado> its easier to just do each individual one
[3:35:45] <brexdq> @heartlesshealer guitars in space is the best combination
[3:35:46] <+thegreenbenis> Shits heavy.
[3:35:53] <ScreamLord> Weird angles kill tethers
[3:36:07] <%Jekado> you can't get the doors when they are open for some weird reason
[3:36:13] <%Jekado> they just... dissapear it seems?
[3:36:17] <NitronStreams> tethers don't seem to like clipping
[3:36:19] <%thelaxinator> Rebel Galaxy has a similar soundtrack but it makes the mistake of adding really basic country vocals
[3:36:25] <%Mr_Pylon> Once the movement clicks in this game it feels really good to fly around
[3:36:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can't wait for Space Blues to be a real genre
[3:36:45] <thelaxinator> The last thing you want to hear when jumping to hyperspace is a country boy saying "save my soul"
[3:36:45] <%Jekado> cowboy bebop basically
[3:36:52] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Yee, and now follow me here, haw!
[3:37:22] <%Jekado> the bottom and top plates are nano carbon
[3:37:24] <$tehbeardedbard> there is a weight limit to the tethers @PatStaresAt
[3:37:38] <+thegreenbenis> Yeah you got most the meat out of this here crab.
[3:37:40] <%Jekado> i think there is a key
[3:37:56] <%Jekado> i think there is a key floating there
[3:37:58] <%aishman> Too heavy
[3:38:00] <lamash7u> Back part is easy to remove and put into the processor.
[3:38:00] <$tehbeardedbard> throw like 5 teathers for the rest of the ship and it should be fine
[3:38:04] <Gragnack> yep thats what it always ends up as
[3:38:05] <%TaifuDragon> furnace
[3:38:08] <NoCreditClear> Eventually what's left is just not worth the effort aside from the satisfaction of seeing a completely empty bay
[3:38:14] <%G_Thunders> ‘Every part of the buffalo’ just seems like this company trying to keep you in debt
[3:38:19] <+D00msDayDan> make sure you haven't been sitting on your arm
[3:38:37] <+Javaa01> As I said, cartilage
[3:38:43] <NoCreditClear> hey, you got a key. that' worth 50k
[3:38:46] <+Katohearts> LONG ARM
[3:38:46] <Scorchfield> eh, key will be nice later but it isn't really useful for this ship
[3:38:49] <%The_Protagonist> why does his song sound so familiar
[3:38:51] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So do those switches work via wifi or something? Because they just pop off the wall like fridge magnets with no wiring conecting them to anything
[3:38:51] <%The_Protagonist> *this
[3:38:53] <%aishman> Yeah the big thing of value is things like the reactor, thruster and fuel
[3:38:55] <%sweetestbeefs> Live and learn tho
[3:39:04] <%aishman> But hey! You're getting more used to things
[3:39:12] <$tehbeardedbard> virgo3090
[3:39:13] <+D00msDayDan> not like debt really matters, don't feel too bad about wasting a shift
[3:39:21] <s1rcuit> @G_Thunders actually Lynx has to purchase every ship so they want every cent they can get from each ship
[3:39:26] <+koriar> Yeah, work orders are what you want to focus on
[3:39:26] <+Katohearts> Yeah cut all you can, but don't pay Lynx to pick the bones
[3:39:31] <NoCreditClear> REPAIR EQUIPMENT
[3:39:35] <+koriar> The LT you ONLY get from work orders
[3:39:45] <Scorchfield> usually if you complete all work orders, its time to move on to a new ship
[3:39:47] <+Brightstreak> Randy pitchford?
[3:39:47] <%AzureGale> DA MACHINE GAWD
[3:39:49] <%Gamblitz> Dam Higaraans giving you bones to chew on.

[3:46:01] <+thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt Opinion on the game so far?

[3:46:01] <HellishLancer> cool
