[0:09:29] <cherrycottontail> who here NOS gang?
[0:09:30] <%GarbageNirvana> I think the idea is the first sip kills your taste buds so the next aren't so bad
[0:09:32] <42nfl19> The ZERO calorie series is better
[0:09:33] <Zer0beats> real pros drink monster zero
[0:09:34] <%nevan0> oh yeah

[0:09:44] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Are you saving it for the candy closet?
[0:09:44] <%derap41> The mango juice is really good

[0:11:08] <%onlypuppet> Dig the hole deeper
[0:11:09] <%Rumbutt> I love the fact that Kojima heard "walking simulator" and thought "what would that actually be like?" and then did it and made it GOOD

[0:12:35] <MusaboriMan2> did I miss anything?
[0:12:38] <%GarbageNirvana> Anyone who knows anything about Jim Sterling shouldn't be surprised that this game is basically anathema to him

[0:14:02] <Ekaelis> Is it just me who finds Jim Sterling more and more obnoxious?
[0:14:02] <%valriot> Item thing in BOTW was such a non issue, there's endless supply of weapons in that game
[0:14:03] <Hepathos87> more like Pat Stranding huhuhuhuh
[0:14:04] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Did you just have a stroke?

[0:14:58] <%Ranryu692> obviously 5 hours ago
[0:14:59] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Cheer100 What I don't get is people who expected this game to be different. I mean, did y'all miss what weird stuff Kojima put into his games prior to having COMPLETE creative control?
[0:15:01] <%skizzuto> you can watch vods on 2x speed
[0:15:01] <@PeachSaliva> @pyrojack6 he‚Äôs fine, just sleep deprived

[0:17:15] <%chubbypencil> @RootShaman It is really weird. like sometimes it is fine, but then it will hitch like crazy, and other times the FPS just tanks for seemingly no reason. appears to be really bottlenecked by CPU
[0:17:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> IS PAT DRINKING MONSTER?
[0:17:18] <+DesertPenguin> Jim Sterling said it's annoying, and when it's not annoying it's boring
[0:17:18] <%valriot> Now I need art of Paige carrying PP in the jar
[0:17:21] <%WhereIsWill> feel like amazon burned kojima in the midwest thats where this game came from LUL

[0:18:05] <+RootShaman> @chubbypencil I guess I can't say I'm surprised, its definitely one of the most graphically intense games ever so porting it probably hard.

[0:21:02] <%valriot> California was probably on fire during the timefall so double fucked, SUPER FAST BURNING
[0:21:03] <%RioGascar> Hey pat tip, do both these missions before going to the windfarm...otherwise you‚Äôll be like me AND CANT CONNECT TO THE STUPID FARM
[0:21:11] <DastardlyDeviant> Upper cut the ps4
[0:21:16] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Optimize those pain buckets
[0:21:18] <%derap41> You know what In New Vegas you where a mail man ok you can't make fun of this game for that
[0:21:19] <%TDAWS_MP132> you probably just need 1
[0:21:20] <tomahank18> Mama!
[0:21:24] <SpaceGuntank> i'd say just take one PCC at a time
[0:21:26] <sabrintb95> hey, this morning you said you would be playing it TOMORROW 3 PM
[0:21:31] <+pyrojack6> you could call this your PARSENAL
[0:21:32] <Dragon_Batman> Making like rope on the go?
[0:21:36] <%MakotoPB> getting paid to watch pat play a game. feels good man
[0:21:39] <+xxgoth_holicxx> why does this look like the MGSV outfitting screen
[0:21:47] <%foreverN2dust> I wonder what a speedrun of this game would look like.
[0:21:47] <%Captainahab_37> cuz it is
[0:21:50] <%chiluzza> bring more shoes
[0:21:51] <Louie_Salmon> You don't always need the supplies they give you, you can just build something for fun or leave them behind.
[0:21:52] <%chiluzza> shoes are like
[0:21:57] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat But what if you need it later?
[0:21:58] <tomahank18> How much shit can Norman Reedus carry?
[0:21:59] <%mistymntns> @AngriestPat Oh Hey Im a little bit ahead of you and I wonder if you'll see my stuff!
[0:22:03] <42nfl19> it is 3pm @sabrintb95 in Canada.
[0:22:03] <%arcaderabbit48> @derap41 You, but you stop being a mailman as soon as you start New Vegas, cause you got shot in the head. This game has you BE the Mailman
[0:22:24] <%mistymntns> @AngriestPat Those are the routes I leiterally jsut took
[0:22:29] <%chiluzza> @arcaderabbit48 so this is a prequel to new vegas
[0:22:36] <Louie_Salmon> @forevern2dust It would involve stumbling because it's faster if you recover
[0:22:41] <RayMan799> !uptime
[0:22:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 22m 43s.
[0:22:45] <%Laecerelius> River's probably haunted
[0:22:46] <42nfl19> wait you can see other people's suggested paths? neato
[0:22:46] <%arcaderabbit48> @chiluzza Its Kojima, so fuckin' maybe!
[0:22:46] <tigerfang86> river must be BIOCURSED
[0:22:47] <%derap41> @arcaderabbit48 you never stopped being a mailman the first thing you do is trying to find out where your package went
[0:22:47] <+Javaa01> Because the MULEs are probably waiting by the river to gank you on the way there
[0:22:50] <dukenux> oh right i forgot this has DSlike online component.
[0:22:58] <pmtriox> the "stares at" part seems real accurate this time
[0:23:00] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> This is not a Urination Station.
[0:23:04] <Louie_Salmon> @angriestpat You can tilt the map to get a feel for height
[0:23:05] <rumuloh> It's bike time boys
[0:23:06] <%Captainahab_37> You Can (Not) Pee
[0:23:08] <%Animorphimagi> lol cuz there's always a path by the river?
[0:23:12] <slylandshark> Dont Pee You Lose Your Social Credits!!
[0:23:12] <%arcaderabbit48> So I watched the last stream, but only jsut got in for this one. I assume I have missed zero plot
[0:23:18] <%MakotoPB> waiting to see when people take super hard routes just to troll
[0:23:18] <xtremegamer80> @rumuloh Bike's out of juice
[0:23:19] <dukenux> You can (Knot) pee
[0:23:29] <rumuloh> Pee in the bike
[0:23:35] <pmtriox> rivers are no joke, don't take them lightly, but cross them lightly
[0:23:36] <xtremegamer80> @MakotoPB THAT WOULD BE DEDICATION
[0:23:40] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat make sure you do both missions before heading to wind farm...otherwise you are uh...unable to connect windfarm and NOW I NEED TO BACKTRACK
[0:23:40] <%onlypuppet> I got my seal hat and I‚Äôm ready to party
[0:23:54] <dukenux> Sam, my name is PeePeePooPoo Man.
[0:23:54] <%Captainahab_37> rivers are ezpz just don't step in the red bit and your cash kino friendo

[0:24:07] <tigerfang86> pat got liked
[0:24:10] <thatoneicebear> Is the stream having a stroke or is that me?
[0:24:13] <dukenux> @JonnyCue oh that's good
[0:24:15] <cureneckbeard> How come you can't just replicate a truck and drive the truck
[0:24:18] <%rytisone> the bike
[0:24:21] <thatoneicebear> I'm getting some stuttering
[0:24:24] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's you icebear

[0:24:27] <lloyddboy> KOJIMAAAAAAAA
[0:24:27] <%Laecerelius> congratulations, Pat
[0:24:28] <%arcaderabbit48> Guys, is this game fun? I know its a good game, but is it actually fun to play? Cause it looks really frustrating.
[0:24:29] <%Captainahab_37> you get exoskeletons and stuff they showed in the demo

[0:24:34] <dukenux> yeah, real time path generation. rad

[0:24:36] <$MachoMadnesss94> Where Conan?
[0:24:40] <%Captainahab_37> I wonder if this game has big cave systems
[0:24:50] <Make_me_mad> Can you spend likes to increase the size of Norman Reedus' bladder?
[0:24:57] <cureneckbeard> Pat how come you can't replicate a plane

[0:27:10] <Louie_Salmon> Let Us Grow Piss-Shrooms Together
[0:27:12] <mield916> Just played this mission myself, have fun.
[0:27:14] <+quietusswain> I have an extremely important question‚Ä¶ can you pee in the rain?
[0:27:16] <%chiluzza> that ladder is so damn small
[0:27:18] <implied_consent> @angriestpat dude what's going on I fell asleep watching you last night on my phone. Got a. Full 8 hours. I woke up and now here. Did you go to bed?
[0:27:23] <+xxgoth_holicxx> .....what even is this game
[0:27:24] <dukenux> :(
[0:27:27] <Hydrapissed> ur ladders suck
[0:27:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> ScottishMadJacko subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey Pat, been a wee while due to university stuff, nice to catch some streams again
[0:27:29] <tigerfang86> nah, it's that norman reedus is HUGE
[0:27:31] <Fluxraw> "Remember Snake..."
[0:27:38] <Xelgus> I still don't know what this is
[0:27:41] <UnfilteredComic> youre ladders were basic pat, step up your game
[0:27:44] <%kyh9> UBISOFT?!
[0:27:45] <+Punisher7771> wait @AngriestPat can you steal peoples shit?
[0:27:46] <%Captainahab_37> okay so this game, you walk, and then people tell you about the post apocalypse and america
[0:27:47] <mayorrev> METAL....GEAR????
[0:27:49] <Animeshowfan> to be fair so many people are playing the odds of people running into yours would be somewhat low
[0:27:51] <%Captainahab_37> there you go, that's the game, enjoy
[0:27:55] <%kyh9> UBI...SOFT?
[0:27:57] <uncledickbutt> ginger ladders gets no love :(
[0:27:57] <tomahank18> @tigerfang86 GIGAREEDUS
[0:28:03] <dukenux> 2/10 - ladder smells like pee, wouldn't climb again
[0:28:07] <implied_consent> !uptime
[0:28:07] <SomersaultJustice> no punch them
[0:28:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 28m 10s.
[0:28:10] <RoldanDgr8> He should put away those laadders
[0:28:12] <Fluxraw> "Ok Boomer"
[0:28:13] <Bigyin396> So I just got here, has the game explained why Norman Reedus has the Funky Fetus?
[0:28:15] <Louie_Salmon> @animeshowfan Also your stuff gets in more player's world's the higher level you are
[0:28:17] <cherrycottontail> It's a good thing you can place a giant watchtower and avoid detection
[0:28:17] <+Punisher7771> kojima can you put this on pc aswell
[0:28:19] <implied_consent> Oh ok you just started.
[0:28:20] <UnfilteredComic> SHouldve saved your piss so you could pee on MULEs
[0:28:22] <%kyh9> "remain undetected with 20 lbs of equipment jangling on you"
[0:28:22] <+Javaa01> Don't pick up the cargo
[0:28:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @Captainahab_37 Okay, but how often do they tell you about the post apocalypse america? Cause that's really the only part I care about
[0:28:25] <JonnyCue> OK Zoomer
[0:28:25] <Animeshowfan> ooo ok!
[0:28:25] <%LouieRouie> Because the things you call dead haven't yet had the chance to be born
[0:28:31] <42nfl19> @angriestpat I would recommend maybe dropping your loot before engaging in combat.
[0:28:34] <%Animorphimagi> btw the game turns into MGS V
[0:28:34] <thegreenbenis> GRAB THE FREE SHIT
[0:28:41] <mayorrev> FREE SHIT
[0:28:44] <+heroicspiritavenger> @punisher7771 it‚Äôs already confirmed for PC eventually
[0:28:47] <ckkc1> DROP LOOT
[0:28:48] <uncledickbutt> So I love red dead 2 - is that the same kind of "slow game" ?
[0:28:49] <yourliteraldog> when are u gonna get kill streak like caw dooty
[0:28:49] <Brandon_Weavers> What did I miss?
[0:28:54] <+Mukkeym1212> The game any good?
[0:28:57] <thegreenbenis> IT'S FREE REAL ESTATE
[0:28:59] <dukenux> The fact that other people can grab it, im less anxious about leaving shit behind
[0:29:00] <Kejang> ehhh
[0:29:06] <+Javaa01> You can grab utility items, but cargo around MULE encampments is bait
[0:29:10] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> 10/10, would pee again
[0:29:13] <tomahank18> @brandon_weavers Pat put on equipment and peed
[0:29:14] <+Mukkeym1212> @uncledickbutt Eh the storyline, at least for the first two hours, is beyond stupid
[0:29:19] <BaslerJones> so everyone liking this ?
[0:29:19] <%kyh9> Local Man cannot scale 2 foot ledge
[0:29:27] <Ion_Laser> @Punisher7771 It will be on Steam and Epic Game Store in Summer 2020
[0:29:27] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Challenge them to a ladder match!
[0:29:34] <Brandon_Weavers> Oh sweet not much then, thankyou
[0:29:43] <uncledickbutt> @Mukkeym1212 I see, might wait for some price drops as I planned
[0:29:45] <dagorad> @BaslerJones the opinions are really mixed on this one
[0:29:47] <lloyddboy> DO BIG SNEAK
[0:29:55] <+miakhalifaisoverrated> big stutters
[0:30:03] <yourliteraldog> quiet!
[0:30:15] <yourliteraldog> hums
[0:30:22] <mield916> I had my hands on it earlier, and I have been loving it
[0:30:23] <+Mukkeym1212> @uncledickbutt That‚Äôs what im gonna do. Wait however long until it‚Äôs $30
[0:30:25] <SolverCODO> Is Pat liking the game so far?
[0:30:32] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[0:30:39] <yourliteraldog> use dd
[0:30:39] <Louie_Salmon> Not perfectly flat, just no rocks basically
[0:30:44] <dukenux> thatl ooks like it needs way flatter terrain
[0:31:04] <UnfilteredComic> Might be because youre in MULE territory?
[0:31:11] <tomahank18> Where in America is this supposed to be?
[0:31:12] <dukenux> and maybe less steep
[0:31:19] <%Tucker0603> fucking really?
[0:31:24] <dukenux> East coast?
[0:31:30] <Louie_Salmon> Huh, I didn't have too much trouble finding a spot
[0:31:31] <Dragon_Batman> I mean your practically on a mountain
[0:31:35] <mield916> no, it needs to be really flat.
[0:31:37] <dagorad> Iceland part of America
[0:31:40] <crummycurmudgeon> how's the input lag on this? That's what turned off of RDR2
[0:31:41] <%ClericOfSparda> that just really doesn't want to be built
[0:31:47] <+Elky3> has he tried turning it off and on again Kappa
[0:31:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> surprising lack of flora, so definitely cold place
[0:31:51] <+Cucamabungabu> so what's the consensu guys? Did Kojima play us like a fiddle?
[0:31:52] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat does it have to be on "blue" terrain maybe?
[0:31:52] <SolverCODO> Reedus is looking real chonky there
[0:31:52] <dukenux> The 51st state of Greenland Kappa
[0:31:53] <%Cozy90> how god damn specific does it need to be
[0:31:56] <+ItsNineTen> !uptime
[0:31:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 31m 58s.
[0:31:57] <yourliteraldog> its unclear people turned into ghost nukes
[0:31:58] <Bigyin396> Go higher
[0:32:01] <tomahank18> I was gonna say, this doesn't look like any state I have seen
[0:32:22] <ackshun_jacksun> Love Elmo
[0:32:29] <@lewdskeletor13> Nothing looks like America because of the time rain
[0:32:30] <deviljhojho_> country roads, take me home
[0:32:32] <+pyrojack6> i mean, multiple explosions probably warped the landscape to shit
[0:32:33] <deviljhojho_> wait there are no roads
[0:32:33] <%Shikari21> Shikari21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:32:36] <yourliteraldog> so America has been blasted by most people dying then exploding
[0:32:37] <%arcaderabbit48> @Cucamabungabu Its absolutely a good game, but its also absolutely not for everyone. So Pat is loving it, but I'd bounce off this shit like a rubber ball hitting a trampoline.
[0:32:42] <Manwad> Pretty flat
[0:32:44] <%dabeaminator> The US looks like the Scottish Highlands in Kojima's lizard brain.
[0:32:45] <dukenux> like an average anime loli
[0:32:47] <bananrrr> FLAT
[0:32:47] <17sevens> more flat then the literal side of a mountain
[0:32:47] <ackshun_jacksun> It's future America
[0:32:48] <mield916> the map is deceptively small, according to the map, he's in kentuky
[0:32:50] <%rytisone> like justice
[0:32:51] <%Shikari21> oh i forgot the stream started early today
[0:32:52] <%Animorphimagi> loli flat
[0:32:53] <Louie_Salmon> @tomahank18 The terrain ages at like a century a minute whenever it rains, so I imagine the landscape changed a lot
[0:33:00] <cureneckbeard> delicious flat terrain
[0:33:02] <+Cucamabungabu> @arcaderabbit48 sounds fair
[0:33:02] <SomersaultJustice> so is this basically my dinner with andre the game?
[0:33:03] <Diablo169> your literally on the side of a mountain :O
[0:33:07] <Bigyin396> You know in Rick and Morty when rick makes that bit of square that is the only flat thing ever created. That flat
[0:33:11] <LunarRemix> But the US never looked like this, even before the colonies arrived
[0:33:16] <ackshun_jacksun> 180 degrees flat pat
[0:33:19] <lloyddboy> LUL
[0:33:22] <deviljhojho_> LUL
[0:33:22] <tomahank18> @louie_salmon that's trippy to think about
[0:33:22] <axelkaspar> snort
[0:33:23] <BaslerJones> is that screenshot of princess beach real ?
[0:33:23] <Make_me_mad> Stealth
[0:33:23] <Manwad> Do you think there's some spatial warping because of the time rain?
[0:33:24] <%theAncopro> there he is
[0:33:24] <Ion_Laser> lol
[0:33:25] <+0range_> LUL
[0:33:29] <Bigyin396> This honestly looks more like Ireland
[0:33:31] <%simulationbard> Stealthy as fuck
[0:33:32] <%kyh9> Dont tell the Mules that you'reIM RIGHT HERE
[0:33:33] <deviljhojho_> with catlike thread
[0:33:35] <cureneckbeard> this is what kojima thinks america looks like
[0:33:37] <tomahank18> It looks like America just grew... upwards
[0:33:38] <%kamakachow> Optimal stealth
[0:33:39] <axelkaspar> Snake, this is a sneaking mission
[0:33:39] <dukenux> Crazy Delivery Man Yells to himself for companionship
[0:33:41] <yourliteraldog> stealth failed
[0:33:42] <thatoneicebear> Such stealth
[0:33:46] <bassoontyphoon> woo
[0:33:54] <@lewdskeletor13> cryMonka
[0:34:05] <UnfilteredComic> Go in tall grass
[0:34:10] <dukenux> Is Low Roar a band from Iceland?
[0:34:14] <+Javaa01> Hide in tall grass to avoid detection
[0:34:15] <%dabeaminator> I think any complaints about this game's plot can be countered with "Because Time Rain".
[0:34:18] <deviljhojho_> tomatoFear
[0:34:20] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think building a watchtower where a guy is just next to it is a good idea
[0:34:22] <Ryham_Assassin> it looks very much like Iceland
[0:34:24] <mield916> a good chunk of my playthrough in BT territory can be summarized like this
[0:34:24] <cureneckbeard> rain nanomachines
[0:34:24] <dukenux> LUL
[0:34:26] <%simulationbard> Fucking invisable
[0:34:30] <deviljhojho_> me tomatoSmile

[0:34:52] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:34:52] <deviljhojho_> "high vantage point"
[0:34:54] <dukenux> JEFF
[0:34:56] <tomahank18> So if there is time rain, does that make all the water like... time water?
[0:35:07] <cureneckbeard> yeah that's why he has to drink monster
[0:35:11] <yourliteraldog> no
[0:35:13] <gekizenbu> somewhere between because time rain but also Because society got addicted to carrying mail by themselves because of THE DRONES TAKING OUR JOBS
[0:35:15] <dukenux> only rain supposedly ages you
[0:35:17] <UnfilteredComic> @tomahank18 It is unclear, my guess is no
[0:35:21] <tigerfang86> l a d d e r
[0:35:26] <%joylent_blue> tomahank18 nah its specifically rain water for..... reasons
[0:35:30] <%Cozy90> what about that guy???
[0:35:32] <dukenux> also, only humans turn into WMDs after dying. why is that?
[0:35:33] <%arcaderabbit48> Apparently the stuff that makes it Time Rain can be purified out of it, so the rivers and drinking water are fine.
[0:35:36] <%dabeaminator> Delivery Addiction is so funny to me
[0:35:38] <cureneckbeard> This game has good water
[0:35:39] <mield916> not all water is, time rain is water with chiral matter in it.
[0:35:41] <+Javaa01> Remember, pinging with cargo will attract the MULEs to you, so don't do it
[0:35:47] <deviljhojho_> HACKERMAN

[0:37:41] <Kejang> too dumb
[0:37:42] <%derap41> They're making navigation to easy+
[0:37:42] <CaptWeirdo> Holy shit man, I just started the game. Is that really how much he carries??
[0:37:46] <%Animorphimagi> shut off the onine

[0:38:02] <dukenux> Giant Fist of PEace
[0:38:05] <willtheprofessional> You can turn that off if you want @AngriestPat so you dont see the player items
[0:38:06] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[0:38:08] <%Ner234> HEAVY
[0:38:12] <%kyh9> Jesus, this game looks like a weird horrific social -network irl
[0:38:13] <tigerfang86> HUGE BOX
[0:38:15] <+Mistheart101> the baby
[0:38:17] <madmatt13x> eventually you go to places you gotta connect to the network first that wont have any player placed items
[0:38:18] <+jetjagger222> this is making me feel tired just by looking at it
[0:38:19] <thatoneicebear> Stronk
[0:38:19] <dukenux> Local Man loose his kneecaps
[0:38:20] <$MachoMadnesss94> @decimated_body shits fucked so we gotta deliver drugs and rebuild the internet to save America
[0:38:21] <%primax104> yeah, I imagine that the world can get super cluttered, unless they do resets or put timers on what people put down
[0:38:22] <mield916> optimize, you can do it anywhere,
[0:38:22] <tomahank18> @captweirdo the real villain of the game is crippling lower back issues
[0:38:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> You couldve stealth taken down that guard
[0:38:24] <dagorad> This game is like if someone made an indie niche game into a triple-a title.
[0:38:38] <reonome> YUM
[0:38:39] <thegreenbenis> @AngriestPat IT GETS HARDER WHEN YOU AREN'T ON THE NETWORK
[0:38:42] <EarthOtherwise> !uptime
[0:38:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 38m 44s.
[0:38:44] <tigerfang86> NABBED

[0:38:47] <%Conyst> you so greedy Pat
[0:38:48] <%WhereIsWill> delicious time!
[0:38:49] <Kejang> @primax104 Timefall is a mechanic that takes care of that
[0:38:52] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat this changes when you go off network. I just got back from windfarm and it was HELL trying to get back on my own with no gear
[0:38:55] <dukenux> Is half of Norman Reedus dialogue grunts
[0:38:58] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Thanks for the help... Carrier Boy.
[0:38:58] <tigerfang86> I get THE REFERENCE
[0:39:02] <%logoth_> Kojumbo is genius
[0:39:03] <tigerfang86> I UNDERSTAND THAT REFERENCE
[0:39:04] <%Saltmeisterr> Yeah this place looks nothing like merica
[0:39:06] <CrowbarFacelift> Anyone know if weather ever becomes a factor?
[0:39:22] <%RioGascar> But now i made someone‚Äôs journey into the windfarm much easier
[0:39:23] <Dragon_Batman> I know there is snow much later
[0:39:24] <cureneckbeard> Is that the plot? He thinks he's in America but he's actually Iceland
[0:39:28] <mield916> Timefall is the biggest factor, as well as wind
[0:39:29] <deviljhojho_> CARGO HIGH
[0:39:30] <tigerfang86> Cargo High????
[0:39:30] <lyzegredjag> CARGO ADDIECTED
[0:39:30] <%Ner234> monkaS
[0:39:32] <%primax104> @Kejang oh yeah, that makes total sense. Good call on that. Is timefall a regular event or random or event based?
[0:39:33] <FerwhateverDota> wut

[0:40:29] <mield916> boomers don't
[0:40:29] <Desertfishing> people also love having a purpose too though
[0:40:29] <yourliteraldog> late stage capitalism
[0:40:31] <Trash_leviathan> not really pat
[0:40:32] <MSN04_Sazabi> No, just you Pat. Fuck robots.

[0:40:41] <+Mistheart101> NO PISSING
[0:40:42] <%kamakachow> Nothing gets me going more than kicking the FedEx man in the balls on the way to work
[0:40:43] <$MachoMadnesss94> @decimated_body we don't know yet
[0:40:43] <%PinkSuprende> so Detroit:BH was early in this games timeline
[0:40:45] <+Punisher7771> no pissing zone
[0:40:45] <%joylent_blue> BB is bappy
[0:40:46] <%Shikari21> I prefer androids like 2B

[0:40:48] <reonome> Baby happy :)
[0:40:48] <Bigyin396> I'd rather have a job than robots, and i hate working
[0:40:48] <uncledickbutt> excuse to make reedus delivery game exposition
[0:40:52] <dukenux> I dunno, there was this video of cute cheetah bots doing jumps and stuff and everyone in the twitter coment s was like "THEY GONNA KILL US ALL"
[0:40:53] <fatalDestiny> robots are cute
[0:40:57] <+Javaa01> Swap them out for the MULE boots you stole
[0:40:58] <%foreverN2dust> it's like when you get abducted from your lyft by an uber driver
[0:40:59] <cherrycottontail> They don't actually, people want other people that thye can bully into offering them "customer service gestures"
[0:41:01] <tigerfang86> don't fist robot girls
[0:41:04] <tigerfang86> don't do it!!!!!
[0:41:04] <%derap41> Cause you pissed on them with the acidicy of MONSTER
[0:41:04] <Decimated_body> @MachoMadnesss94 will we ever know?
[0:41:07] <%arcaderabbit48> Broke: Monster Girls. Woke: Robot Guys
[0:41:08] <Brandon_Weavers> Pat your only saying that because they haven't taken your job yet
[0:41:10] <%Shikari21> Aigis is best robot girl
[0:41:14] <Dragon_Batman> Yea you never put them away
[0:41:17] <%dabeaminator> If a robot can do my job better than me, then yeah I'll die for the betterment of society.
[0:41:19] <yourliteraldog> Unfortunately people don't really understand the consequences of automation, in
[0:41:24] <JonnyCue> Corridor Digital's video perfectly demonstrated what's gonna happen
[0:41:25] <+0range_> my dad would both love and hate robots because he needs to keep himself busy all the time with chores
[0:41:25] <mield916> there's a vehicle next to here pat.
[0:41:36] <Manwad> people get so mad at computers fucking up, imagine having your Amazon drone get stuck in a tree
[0:41:37] <Taconotz> This feels like Elite Dangerous but on foot
[0:41:38] <%joylent_blue> pat has so many likes you guys
[0:41:38] <yourliteraldog> on a layman level
[0:41:40] <%ScottishMadJacko> he cant use the bike yet
[0:41:45] <Nexoosen> It doesnt have energy a note said mield
[0:41:46] <%dabeaminator> The motorcycle doesn't work yet.
[0:41:56] <yourliteraldog> so if you lose your job to automation it
[0:42:03] <tomahank18> @manwad if you can get it out of the tree, it's yours
[0:42:03] <lyzegredjag> BORK
[0:42:05] <ClicheHiei> has Pat have to deal with Mules yet?
[0:42:06] <Taconotz> Has the sperm been delivered yet?
[0:42:07] <mield916> Ok, didn't see last stream
[0:42:08] <%rytisone> the rest of you ain't doing jack shit
[0:42:13] <iggdrafolium> is this Pizza time the game?
[0:42:13] <black_pariah> @AngriestPat you probably already know this, but there's a new Kunio-kun game out today
[0:42:14] <+Punisher7771> so are the bunkers like cities or houses?
[0:42:17] <SNAFUed1> DO CARGO
[0:42:18] <dagorad> so the only companies that survive in the future are monster and amazon?
[0:42:19] <thatoneicebear> SO facebook likes are currency
[0:42:20] <Bigyin396> If we ever get communication holograms people are just going to spend the whole conversation punching each other's holo junk.
[0:42:25] <yourliteraldog> deliver the ovum
[0:42:29] <rowboat_girlyman> You STOLE those likes more like
[0:42:34] <%joylent_blue> pats doing all da work
[0:42:38] <CaptWeirdo> Wait... Pat, how far are you in this game?
[0:42:39] <FerwhateverDota> so in the future we can live just by drinking mosnter and eating weird giant babylike worms
[0:42:45] <mastertwin2> I feel like there's a social commentary behind getting likes from quests by npcs
[0:42:47] <+Lehmbrick> MORE BANDWITH PogChamp

[0:43:31] <%ScottishMadJacko> give it time, think they dont spawn in other people's worlds right away
[0:43:32] <%arancet> "i wasnt given enough likes in this game 0/10"
[0:43:33] <CrowbarFacelift> This is just an Amazon fulfillment center

[0:46:13] <+Punisher7771> stop fucking with shit we shouldnt
[0:46:13] <tigerfang86> what could POSSIBLY GO WRONG

[0:46:17] <Taconotz> I really wonder how well this game is gonna sell, it seems like it would appeal to so few people
[0:46:17] <Dragon_Batman> Yea no wonder shits fucked

[0:46:37] <%Laecerelius> you have lots of random stuff on you, Pat
[0:46:37] <%dabeaminator> Recycle your materials
[0:46:37] <yourliteraldog> chirality is a type of symmetry

[0:47:28] <ClicheHiei> But what if....
[0:47:30] <Taconotz> I feel like the more we joke about the Stadia the more likely it actually succeeding becmes
[0:47:32] <%Hobojo153> Is this the gritty reboot of Tetris?
[0:47:33] <+OblivionSword1> How far is pat currently ?
[0:47:34] <%floodtalon> !uptime
[0:47:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 47m 36s.
[0:47:35] <+Lehmbrick> @MachoMadnesss94 id like to think it still be in beta by then LUL
[0:47:36] <Aristotlay> Pat was born to menu manage this game.
[0:47:40] <%dabeaminator> Stadia will work great once they get the Chiral network up and running
[0:47:46] <dukenux> You face Jeff Bezos and you have to pee in all his 23 bathrooms to defeat him.
[0:47:48] <%jackythefrost> @OblivionSword1 He's still very early in
[0:47:51] <+Punisher7771> your halling 77 pounds on foot AND YOUR LIFTING WITH YOUR BASK
[0:47:51] <jifbua> get new boots
[0:47:53] <%aishman> @AngriestPat So what's your opinion on the best walking sim?
[0:47:55] <+Javaa01> You should probably recycle those torn up boots you're wearing and swap them out for the good pair you have on you
[0:47:59] <%floodtalon> just joined the stream, what's went down so far
[0:48:05] <Taconotz> Holy shit this is just elite dangerous without the space ships
[0:48:05] <%joylent_blue> @OblivionSword1 like barely into the "real" gameplay
[0:48:12] <Aristotlay> Where's the line between exploration gamez and walking simulators
[0:48:14] <Borkbiff > ...Chirelium
[0:48:15] <Dragon_Batman> Isn't that where the BTs were? or at least close to
[0:48:16] <%aishman> @Taconotz FUCK YOU'RE RIGHt
[0:48:18] <SpaceGuntank> they're crystals now? i thought it was a particle?!
[0:48:18] <%Hobojo153> @Taconotz You're totally right
[0:48:19] <Gieron667> @AngriestPat you know you are covering the UI with your webcam right ?
[0:48:21] <$zackalan> has there been any cutscenes since pat started?

[0:48:42] <%joylent_blue> but we have to know BOOT STATUS
[0:48:48] <+Punisher7771> but do you have to pee
[0:48:48] <codename_atorias> hullo
[0:48:49] <%dabeaminator> I haven't seen a single tree
[0:48:49] <dukenux> Walking sims usually require you to just push FWD button. This makes you actualy put effort into traversing it seems.
[0:48:53] <deviljhojho_> THE DAWN OF THE UNIVERSE
[0:48:54] <$zackalan> has there been any cutscenes since pat started?
[0:48:56] <dagorad> why you dink redbull?
[0:48:58] <Desertfishing> make a delivery in the nude
[0:48:58] <PortableBoredom> I'm told this game is about delivering cum, how much cum have we delivered so far
[0:49:00] <%jackythefrost> @AngriestPat Apprently over half the game is side content that could make the game over 100 hours long if you go real hard at it
[0:49:03] <%ScottishMadJacko> Hey Pat, id recommend focusing on the main story for a wee bit
[0:49:04] <Aristotlay> so its a HIKING sim
[0:49:04] <yourliteraldog> specifically in chemistry chirality is a type of mirrored symmetry that although the chemical make up of atoms is the same, its chiral symmetry makes it behave differently sometimes drastically so.
[0:49:05] <tigerfang86> yeah definitely
[0:49:06] <Taconotz> How does Pat play this game while it contains Monster? I don't think Red Bull would be too happy
[0:49:07] <ClicheHiei> but the beach thou...
[0:49:08] <+Lehmbrick> @dagorad cause hes pat
[0:49:08] <%skeletor42069> drink your MONSTER ENERGY(TM) canteen

[0:49:54] <%Hobojo153> So how much of MGS5 is in this game? The walk cycle seems similar
[0:49:57] <%arcaderabbit48> They tepped in to the afterlife, and discovered tahcyons, and decided this was shit that totally needed to be fucked with
[0:50:00] <+Lehmbrick> @dagorad pats still pat lol
[0:50:01] <Taconotz> Kojima totally just throws amazing cocaine parties to get all these people in his stuff, doesnt he
[0:50:02] <thegreenbenis> Always have a spare.

[0:50:11] <lloyddboy> SHOW FEET

[0:51:20] <uncledickbutt> souls of the lost return to it's vessel

[0:52:13] <%derap41> Wait I got that wrong
[0:52:30] <konarius> man these logs are so cringy
[0:52:31] <%skeletor42069> this game needed Sam to wear some TIMBS deadass
[0:52:36] <Taconotz> I think the boots in MGSV were sponsored
[0:52:38] <%aishman> God everyone's name in this game is fucking dumb
[0:52:38] <%derap41> syphilis is the right one
[0:52:43] <dagorad> I spaced out, could you repeat the whole thing plz

[0:53:20] <UnfilteredComic> Ghost rivers
[0:53:21] <Camail> and ghost rivers
[0:53:25] <%dabeaminator> Kojima is just David Cage with a less ironic fanbase.
[0:53:25] <%Laecerelius> River's fucking haunted!
[0:53:26] <%joylent_blue> but what about ghosts in the rivers
[0:53:31] <Borkbiff > It's a cocaine-gram
[0:53:31] <+Punisher7771> @skeletor42069 nike runing from a ton of bt just do it
[0:53:36] <%skeletor42069> Woolie needs to play this so he can call ghosts bitches
[0:53:37] <%rytisone> ghosts can't harm acording to Woolie

[0:53:41] <%Conyst> Twitch just now told me you were going live Pat

[0:54:06] <coracor> HNGH
[0:54:17] <%GarbageNirvana> @dabeaminator The difference is Kojima's games are actually fun to play
[0:54:23] <Rashnam> How's Pat been liking the game so far?
[0:54:28] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe they want you to make something
[0:54:32] <thegreenbenis> @Rashnam A lot
[0:54:33] <%joylent_blue> he seems to like it
[0:54:42] <+redstonej> can you carry more things
[0:54:46] <+Javaa01> Recycling those old boots almost gave you back all the resources you needed to make a new pair, since you just lost 2 resources in total, so it's worth recycling the boots rather then waiting for them to wear out completely
[0:54:47] <KanukMunch> yeah, this is basically "The Sorrow: the game"
[0:54:49] <Manderfuzz> can gear in your private locker be accessed remotely via postboxes?
[0:54:53] <+Punisher7771> wait whats a canadin boot company?

[0:55:25] <xtremegamer80> ARE WE SHINRA?
[0:55:25] <%crimsonharvest> right, because the particles fall off the BTs when they stomp around like we saw
[0:55:25] <bassoontyphoon> so.... the crystals are the souls

[1:08:44] <%floralkami> pretty sure its just supposed to be cringe
[1:08:47] <dagorad> prank gone wrong (death)?

[1:09:36] <%floralkami> build a bridge and get under it
[1:09:37] <ergheisu> more like the bridging of death
[1:09:45] <%furiousfurioso> not really
[1:09:47] <%theAncopro> not if you have BRIDGE
[1:09:48] <%derap41> Are we going to build farm houses later?

[1:09:51] <KasiCrafter> Not really?
[1:09:51] <%TDAWS_MP132> look at where the player paths are
[1:09:53] <Nexoosen> if only you placed a bridge last night
[1:09:53] <dero45> Your never gonna make it
[1:09:53] <SpaceGuntank> the time rain will eat the bridge though
[1:09:58] <coracor> HEY!
[1:09:58] <%Animorphimagi> go up or down river....
[1:10:00] <BreakTheBarrier> hey
[1:10:02] <+Dumb_Parrot> @valachi I don't give them anything, I don't have a Sony console. Really? No gameplay? It's objectively wrong. You not liking the gameplay doesn't mean it's not there.
[1:10:03] <+majorchange> just swim
[1:10:04] <%derap41> was that you or someone else?
[1:10:06] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat build one at a place with red in the middle

[1:10:23] <alicespider> ah yes, my favorite landscape of the USA, the fjords
[1:10:23] <bassoontyphoon> Rain kills bridges
[1:10:24] <%Lost_Zombie> Pat builds bridge to island
[1:10:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Did you just get an answer
[1:10:28] <cureneckbeard> you can't swim because of armor check penalty

[1:10:41] <%dabeaminator> You should save the bridge for a chasm or something.

[1:11:22] <%onlypuppet> apatRaffle
[1:11:27] <reonome> fucking ghosts
[1:11:36] <+Dumb_Parrot> @valachi you're seeing gameplay right now ffs. Stop repeating stupid reddit/4chan "thoughts"
[1:11:38] <lloyddboy> there's your dumbass watchtower
[1:11:40] <Wablafarga> riverside's haunted
[1:11:44] <ergheisu> the time water ate the buildings
[1:11:46] <Tomschiii> ds is pretty much like withcer 3, long and kinda boring tutorial, just ok gameplay mechanics and thats about it :P
[1:11:46] <Aristotlay> What does the sick robot arm do
[1:11:48] <deviljhojho_> lmao how are ghosts real
[1:11:51] <%derap41> Damn ghost dragging down the property values
[1:11:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Moon's haunted
[1:11:54] <%jackythefrost> I'll be honest @AngriestPat it does get annoying as they do that little scene EVERYTIME BT's are around
[1:11:54] <deviljhojho_> just close your eyes and dont breath
[1:11:56] <LordOfThePoultry> @angriestpat throw your pee at the ghosts
[1:12:00] <%derap41> GUN?
[1:12:04] <CelestialOR> just joined, did I miss anything
[1:12:08] <coracor> Pat you are just going to absolutely vandalize the whole country aren't you
[1:12:10] <ergheisu> PISS OFF GHOSTS
[1:12:13] <+majorchange> this seems like a game i want to spend a whole saturday playing and not touch it at all outside of that
[1:12:14] <%Bananamanstan> Do the ghost want your pee?
[1:12:15] <%RyuuAoi> So what happened to the baby? Is it dead? Is he/she a stand?
[1:12:17] <+jcenderion> Rain's haunted
[1:12:20] <Dragon_Batman> Didn't miss much
[1:12:22] <+Lehmbrick> @derap41 just started yesterday no gun yet plus probably bad idea
[1:12:23] <dagorad> cmonBruh
[1:12:23] <Junkles> what if you invited the BTS into a hot tub and then peed in the hot tub?
[1:12:24] <+OkamiDude15> @CelestialOR pat pissed on a bike and marked it as his own
[1:12:25] <cureneckbeard> baby stand
[1:12:28] <%derap41> @ergheisu Piss on ghosts
[1:12:31] <BrOOnoh> yes you miss all the running ohnKoji
[1:12:33] <LunarRemix> Then play normally and build one when you need one
[1:12:33] <Dragon_Batman> It takes like alot of resources no?
[1:12:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RyuuAoi its a baby stand
[1:12:36] <%onlypuppet> More of the same, but sleepier
[1:12:37] <%joylent_blue> the baby is magic because its mom was brain dead
[1:12:40] <valachi> @Dumb_Parrot Yeah and it fucking sucks, even the most positive shills for the game don't like the gameplay.
[1:12:40] <ergheisu> no one wants to use bridges. they like walking
[1:12:42] <+Punisher7771> so is time fall like acid rain on steroids?
[1:12:44] <CelestialOR> bett, get that cardio
[1:12:48] <%Animorphimagi> then continue story progress
[1:12:54] <+majorchange> i think the rain degrades things
[1:12:56] <%derap41> @Lehmbrick lame
[1:12:59] <+OblivionSword1> does the baby has a name ?
[1:12:59] <pabloelenano2> @AngriestPat use your lazzy brain and think where to put it to do less effort
[1:13:07] <+Lehmbrick> @derap41 sure bud lol
[1:13:08] <+OkamiDude15> time fall is a localized version of greatful dead
[1:13:12] <Dragon_Batman> The rain accelerates time on what it touches

[1:13:20] <%kikanshat0masu> kikanshat0masu subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:13:21] <%Thorlias> @angriestpat if you're gonna build a bridge, DONT DO IT IN A TIMEFALL AREA! it'll degrade I think!
[1:13:23] <WeebFever> Why does it still glow when emptied
[1:13:28] <+majorchange> so if the baby got hit by rain would it grow up
[1:13:29] <%RyuuAoi> @oblivionsword1 Imma just go with Baby Stand
[1:13:33] <%onlypuppet> Cry harder, King
[1:13:43] <%damienlunas> So which game is more American, Death Stranding or Metal Wolf Chaos?
[1:13:52] <deviljhojho_> metal wolf always wins
[1:13:56] <xtremegamer80> BRIDGE TIME
[1:13:59] <Quizzeh_> DIE HARDMAN

[1:14:05] <+succthulu> atpChar
[1:14:08] <%SilverDevilfish> HOT COLDMAN v2
[1:14:09] <+supaXmugen> i feel like Time Rain is more of a "memory saving mechanic" than an actual "I thought this would be a cool idea" mechanic
[1:14:15] <+Grayhammatter> die-hardman
[1:14:17] <+Punisher7771> so roided up acid rain
[1:14:18] <%Bananamanstan> So are we going to ghost crater former phone of Paige?
[1:14:21] <Aristotlay> hot bridge action unadulterated and uncut
[1:14:32] <%dabeaminator> Build this BRIDGES (TM) bridge, Bridget Bridges!
[1:14:33] <SolverCODO> "No but do the bridge tho"
[1:14:34] <%derap41> @supaXmugen more like a cool idea for a memory saving mechanic
[1:14:45] <dukenux> Do it for Bridget Bridges
[1:14:47] <+2DSuperiority> triDoubt Death Firmguy
[1:14:50] <$notcbo> Is this game scary?
[1:14:56] <%GarbageNirvana> The fact that her name is actually Bridget
[1:14:56] <%RyuuAoi> Kojima put building in the game. "Here you go you Fornite Chucks!" -Kojima
[1:14:56] <%Conyst> that bridge Kreygasm
[1:15:01] <+majorchange> seems like it can be stressful
[1:15:09] <xtremegamer80> Ohhhhh, that's why you claim it
[1:15:13] <+Punisher7771> ok who is this bridget person and why should i care
[1:15:16] <Dragon_Batman> This game has more tension in parts so far than scary
[1:15:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> uou need 800
[1:15:21] <%TDAWS_MP132> the president
[1:15:25] <%Bananamanstan> Competitive death stranding ‚Äúyour the mule‚Äù
[1:15:28] <tr00ly_> so when do you do stuff
[1:15:30] <mield916> not for this bridge
[1:15:36] <xtremegamer80> @Punisher7771 She was the president and your mom, she is dead
[1:15:41] <%jackythefrost> It's not really meant to be scary
[1:15:43] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat How much of this game are you going to have to play to have an opinion according to the internet?
[1:15:46] <%derap41> no pissing on the runway
[1:15:59] <%RyuuAoi> Piss on the bridge, Pat!
[1:16:01] <+supaXmugen> @derap41 it is until you look outside and see no buildings or cool geography and Kojima is like "well the rain made it disappear. lol" thus robbing the player of a cool Japanese interpretation of a post apocalyptic America.
[1:16:14] <UnusualSalmon> "pat stares at death stranding" is for once an accurate title because staring at this game is about all u can do
[1:16:16] <+Dumb_Parrot> @valachi OK, you think liking a game's gameplay is not subjective. Don't mind me, won't waste your time anymore. LUL
[1:16:25] <SpaceGuntank> thats a fucking metal gear pod if i've ever seen one
[1:16:28] <mield916> at this point, I was sold.
[1:16:33] <%jackythefrost> @StaceMcGate I just reached the first boss 8 hours in, so you gotta play quite a bit to get a grap of everything
[1:16:36] <cbdg> we must construct additional pylons
[1:16:40] <%StaceMcGate> What part of this U.S. is this supposed to be in?
[1:16:45] <+majorchange> put stickers on it PogChamp
[1:16:46] <mield916> kentuckt
[1:16:47] <xtremegamer80> Ooooooooooo
[1:16:49] <mield916> y
[1:16:51] <%derap41> @supaXmugen not really following you last point
[1:16:56] <%nofestu2> Put speed lines on it
[1:16:58] <+Javaa01> But it has to live long enough for you to get those upgrades in first
[1:16:59] <LordWaldemaart> this is kojimas cool interpretation @supaxmugen
[1:17:00] <%jackythefrost> It takes place over the whole US
[1:17:00] <tr00ly_> grap
[1:17:08] <BrOOnoh> if the game perfoms well and doesnt have bugs everything else its subjective
[1:17:08] <mankeyfigh> HOLY SHIT
[1:17:10] <%furiousfurioso> ghost internet is powerful stuff
[1:17:12] <lloyddboy> no rails?
[1:17:13] <%derap41> This is more Grey goo than 3D printing

[1:17:19] <+supaXmugen> @AngriestPat Make it out of Twinkies Pat. Time Rain cant affect that shit."
[1:17:21] <%onlypuppet> Don‚Äôt forget to blow it up later
[1:17:23] <%jackythefrost> But this is still the east coast where pat is now
[1:17:24] <%Noelle_wasLunaAshford> Timefall?
[1:17:26] <%joylent_blue> just don't fall in :)
[1:17:26] <%Laecerelius> Amazing bridge, Pat!
[1:17:28] <%derap41> now you can exact tolls
[1:17:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> You know we got a new theory on how to do 3d printing with a common video projector and a rotating stand
[1:17:29] <+OkamiDude15> smocking sexy style rank for this bridge sam
[1:17:29] <+Punisher7771> WAIT WE HAVE A 3D PRINTER ON CRACK YET YALL FUCKS ARE STILL ON EARTH?
[1:17:31] <+majorchange> this tech is kinda nuts yeah
[1:17:34] <CriminalMasterminds> Damn that's wild
[1:17:34] <dero45> 3d printed America
[1:17:39] <%Laecerelius> Rain causes things to age super fast
[1:17:39] <+OperatorPlease> @Noelle_wasLunaAshford the rain accelerates time by like 5 million percent
[1:17:40] <%RyuuAoi> Will you be back?do you really need to customize bridge?
[1:17:40] <xtremegamer80> OH SHIT
[1:17:46] <xtremegamer80> PEOPLE CAN HELP BUILD BRIDGES
[1:17:52] <mield916> the 3d printer runs on chiral shit.
[1:18:00] <+supaXmugen> @LordWaldemaart then the man has finally gone senile and we have this game to show us all the result.
[1:18:01] <MojoKingIzakku> rebuild america together
[1:18:05] <Aristotlay> so is that now in someone else's game or what?
[1:18:05] <Dragon_Batman> @Noelle_wasLunaAshford Timefall is the rain that accelerated time on what it touches
[1:18:08] <mankeyfigh> Yoy should rest
[1:18:09] <+majorchange> make america bridge again
[1:18:10] <%Bananamanstan> @punisher7771 that‚Äôs a good point unless they fucked up the entirety of existence
[1:18:17] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Has there been a less on the nose name for a Delivery guy?
[1:18:20] <%onlypuppet> OWL2019Mercy apatJpeg
[1:18:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is this what happens when Richards wins?
[1:18:23] <+ProtoT1> Is bridge a metaphor for something im missing?
[1:18:29] <deviljhojho_> WE NEED MORE POWER

[1:18:44] <%joylent_blue> good job chat
[1:18:46] <LordWaldemaart> @supaxmugen thats like your opinion, man
[1:18:46] <+Javaa01> But more importantly, you unlock Generators to build
[1:18:47] <%joylent_blue> can always count on you
[1:18:48] <KanukMunch> can you actually cross path with another player?
[1:18:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> THAT BREAKS PHYSICS

[1:19:33] <Aristotlay> @angriestpat are bridges part of the asynchronous multiplayer??

[1:38:59] <Make_me_mad> I don't think leaving the planet will work. Wouldn't you just fuck up the next planet as soon as someone died?
[1:39:02] <chidere> !uptime
[1:39:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 39m.

[1:44:50] <Manwad> you get a bike and can repair it via soring it in your garage
[1:44:51] <+Javaa01> You can go pick up the Motorcycle now though, since you can make Generators
[1:44:51] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat use the generator on the bike so you can drive most of the way there
[1:44:54] <mield916> you can cut through the incinerator zone
[1:44:55] <%crimsonharvest> like the BIKE holy shit
[1:44:56] <%theAncopro> BIKE

[1:45:39] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat also to repair vehicles you park them on the elevators in the bigger outposts and put them in the garage
[1:45:42] <GUNxSPECTRE> Do you also have to work retail in this game?
[1:45:44] <+Eddy21forsaken> do it for mama

[2:39:24] <%valriot> SPEEDY BOI
[2:39:24] <SolverCODO> my reedus pepis is augmented
[2:39:25] <+CCCPKi> Personal locker
[2:39:28] <SoySocks> personal locker
[2:39:31] <Dragon_Batman> It's in your private locker no?
[2:39:31] <%Shadicara> Sweat piss
[2:39:38] <xeros720> pat is literally asking, "how do i get my sweat piss out of my body?"
[2:39:45] <APsaull> so far this game seems pretty enjoyable. I was surprised to see some many people be down on it
[2:39:46] <SolverCODO> Norman Reedus and his mushroom piss penis
[2:39:48] <%Doruben> time limit?
[2:39:54] <lloyddboy> 3
[2:39:55] <xtremegamer80> Get back to Capital Knot City
[2:39:56] <+ultimafullmetal> Private lockers are not connected
[2:39:57] <%Shadicara> In bladder
[2:39:58] <$HyperionXV> The piss is back at the last bass
[2:40:01] <%dabeaminator> In your balls
[2:40:02] <SparkAfterDark> I feel like it's such a waste to add in an autobalance button because there's literally no point in ever not doing it and therefore no fun RE4 box sorting mechanic
[2:40:02] <xeros720> ahaha, he lost his piss
[2:40:03] <%demegodz> Piss in the balls
[2:40:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[2:40:04] <Saunt> wrong location?
[2:40:04] <xcompleasedad> Wrong base?
[2:40:07] <denmonari> PISS IS STORED IN THE BALLS
[2:40:08] <%onlypuppet> Spin faster! NO! FASTER!
[2:40:12] <SpaceGuntank> maybe you had to physically pick it up at the last base?
[2:40:12] <%karl_rex> "Where's my piss?" - Pat Boivin

[2:40:29] <Manderfuzz> what the fuck is the point of connecting shit if private lockers aren't even connected?
[2:40:30] <%Shadicara> Get driving nerd
[2:40:30] <Mr_Rakjo> Build a Bridge
[2:40:34] <+Yellowrobe> this game is a temple to Monster Energy
[2:40:38] <%foreverN2dust> just imagine if this game had escort missions
[2:40:49] <leothewhitelion> What the actual fuck is this game tho
[2:40:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the game IS an escort mission
[2:40:51] <xeros720> you escort the bb every mission
[2:40:52] <%Laecerelius> guess you gotta take the long way around
[2:40:55] <%waifoong98> @foreverN2dust human delivery heh
[2:40:55] <Div_the_Penguin> look for a spot to charge your bike on the way
[2:40:57] <+Darren716> It seems like everytime i come back to this stream the same exact thing is going on
[2:40:58] <beno1133> Time to build some bridges!
[2:40:59] <%DrWolpertinger> @angriestpat is the game a fun?
[2:41:02] <%joylent_blue> i mean the boxes have durability its basically an escort mission
[2:41:02] <$Sir_stride> so does pat like the game?
[2:41:03] <dekkitout> OR does BB escort you?
[2:41:04] <SparkAfterDark> This game is all but guaranteed to have escort missions
[2:41:05] <SpaceGuntank> build a bridge on that lake
[2:41:07] <xtremegamer80> Wait did 4 seconds pass in the meu?
[2:41:08] <jifbua> you might have trouble getting over the river with the bike
[2:41:09] <%onlypuppet> Someday we‚Äôll look back at this moment and Cry
[2:41:14] <%ScottishMadJacko> Take a PCC to set up a generator
[2:41:18] <denmonari> Bridge needs like 800 metal Pat

[2:41:41] <%honeyman18> bring a ramp bro
[2:41:45] <Dragon_Batman> Build a generator for the bike near her just in case
[2:41:49] <UnfilteredComic> Water fucks up the bike if its deep

[2:50:14] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[2:50:15] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> you'd only need to trade sperm and eggs

[2:50:16] <xeros720> peeing on things probably works though
[2:50:27] <Dragon_Batman> Yea in last stream he did the stare at Sam's dong thing
[2:50:38] <+Di0nin> wait can you see sam's dink
[2:50:39] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat theres some irony in the game saying be a good person and help out...when most people are just doing this for likes...the message kinda backfires
[2:50:39] <xGeneralDOOM> cant wait to see him how much materia main roads consume
[2:50:46] <DXLelouch24> Did Pat get to any story stuff yet?
[2:50:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dakuu75 someone said 10 hour tutorial

[2:51:00] <Dragon_Batman> @Dakuu75 Technically this is the first vehicle
[2:51:01] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> empathy is fueled by likes
[2:51:03] <gekizenbu> @RioGascar it also talked about how likes are a replacement for the happyness chemical in your brain
[2:51:05] <@lewdskeletor13> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[2:51:06] <studleydoorite> jermaSlug the BABY

[2:51:21] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[2:51:21] <goombella> When the likes are literally gratitude, that is being a good person
[2:51:22] <dekkitout> Pay it forward
[2:51:24] <%onlypuppet> That‚Äôs foresight for you
[2:51:25] <LunarRemix> But you are not doing to help others, you are doing it to help yourself
[2:51:26] <fugnuggets01> But the likes tho
[2:51:26] <+curlym0nster> @angriestpat Do you think Hideo unfiltered is better or better when someone else besides him produces his work?
[2:51:27] <%theAncopro> is evil doing good still good?
[2:51:29] <%Bailey__gaming> what do you get for having lots of likes?
[2:51:29] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Pat, Woolie is the liar.
[2:51:30] <%valriot> Just because you wanna help people doesn't mean you should go unrewarded
[2:51:30] <$rekinom> Doing a job for currency is not a bad thing either
[2:51:31] <startstoprepeat> the word "likes" is loaded because of facebook and youtube and shit, it's just showing your appreciation
[2:51:31] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat is a very complicated gremlin
[2:51:31] <%Cozy90> LOST CARGO PAT!
[2:51:33] <%honeyman18> Help all the people walking pizzas to NEETS
[2:51:34] <Sammang> if youre being helpful, who cares?
[2:51:38] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> PICK UP THAT CARGO
[2:51:40] <Jontman42> @AngriestPat What do you get from likes?
[2:51:41] <zenith0111> Is being liked such a bad thing?
[2:51:43] <SparkAfterDark> "I'm only doing good things because then people will like me and show that they like me by liking me" Yeah bro that's how being a good person works good job you figured it out.
[2:51:43] <%waifoong98> what if they built it just to cover the entire map with shit LUL
[2:51:45] <SoySocks> i wish instead of likes they were "thank yous"
[2:51:46] <NJigglypuff> if the rain makes you age, shouldnt the rivers too?
[2:51:47] <Saunt> I guess these paths are forming where peopl walk alot?
[2:51:49] <Camail> Thorlias depends on the nature of how each material breaks down, what the actual rate of decay is, how long the storms last, etc.
[2:51:50] <+jiggy_snipe> altruism is a myth anyway
[2:51:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @theAncopro hard to say
[2:51:50] <xGeneralDOOM> dont pick free stuff Kappa
[2:51:50] <Dakuu75> do the Likes serve a purpose? Are they currency? or is it just for shits and giggles?

[2:52:01] <%valriot> That's a good ass generator
[2:52:03] <+Nomicro4u> Just wait until you can get likes for virtue signaling
[2:52:04] <xeros720> supposedly likes are a general score addition to every mission in the game
[2:52:12] <alicespider> the aesthetic of the technology in this is very interesting

[2:52:28] <Camail> Thorlias also if you hide your trash under a rock it stays around forever
[2:52:30] <%Rumbutt> If actions can only be altruistic if you don't gain ANY benefit from them yourself, even if that benefit is only appreciation from people, or the feeling of "Oh, I helped out!" than NOBODY is good, and the only way you can ever be good is by suffereing, which is a toxic goddamn ethical mindset, lbr

[3:16:38] <+Punchasaur> Mortality
[3:16:43] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> are diarrhea grenades stronger than shit grenades?
[3:16:54] <Dragon_Batman> The hat
[3:16:56] <%joylent_blue> Dakuu75 yeah, that's my impression anyway
[3:16:57] <BoneofMalkav> I am 10 Grenades :)
[3:17:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pisslord pat
[3:17:02] <reonome> yes
[3:17:04] <xtremegamer80> Ye
[3:17:05] <%Run44forrest> turn the grenades into momster energy
[3:17:07] <thegreenbenis> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Only if they have peanuts in them, they add shrapnel
[3:17:08] <xtremegamer80> I was gonna say
[3:17:08] <%dmtjinni> How often you engage in combat in DS? @AngriestPat
[3:17:08] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Yes
[3:17:09] <Sokumotanaka> nope
[3:17:10] <+Bipolarhernandez> It sounds like Conan
[3:17:10] <+jiggy_snipe> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw I assume they are like WP grenades
[3:17:11] <rumuloh> It's YOUR voice Pat
[3:17:13] <%Cozy90> Oh my god i tuned in for like 2 minutes to see how DSP is doing and his commentary is so annoying.
[3:17:15] <zenith0111> IT'S SUPER WEIRD
[3:17:16] <StripesUltimateEdition> ü§î
[3:17:17] <deviljhojho_> Its kind of unclear
[3:17:17] <tigerfang86> it's weird
[3:17:25] <jifbua> is there driffrent hats?
[3:17:29] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[3:17:29] <%waifoong98> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Diarhea for AoE, Constipation for big DMG Kappa
[3:17:30] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> eight hours?
[3:17:30] <+Punchasaur> Chimpanzees would be great at fighting ghosts
[3:17:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 17m.
[3:17:32] <%onlypuppet> No gun, no problem
[3:17:33] <+OperatorPlease> FULL kojima
[3:17:34] <NeroInfinite> Yeah sounds like Elite dangerous alright
[3:17:34] <Dakuu75> this is basically an empty-as-fuck MMORPG lol
[3:17:36] <$HyperionXV> There has been a bit of running from enemies
[3:17:36] <%BlackMage66652> @Cozy90 What else did you expect from the Piglord?
[3:17:37] <CursedNobleman> @Cozy90 DSP? LUL
[3:17:38] <%honeyman18> Big Optional I hope
[3:17:43] <gekizenbu> you can engage in combat by beating up evil mailmen for their mail
[3:17:44] <Nina96> could u even walk to the crater? @AngriestPat
[3:17:48] <%Cozy90> You're right i dunno what i was thining
[3:17:49] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> technically he could've but avoid it
[3:17:49] <Dragon_Batman> You could probably punch or take out the mule doods tho, just wasn't a reason to
[3:17:51] <NeroInfinite> "I've been playing for eight hours and have yet to fight another ship"
[3:17:52] <%Cozy90> thinking*
[3:17:55] <SpaceGuntank> there is a BT marker on that path..
[3:17:55] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> DSP will outlive Kojima
[3:18:08] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a weird thing to me in general when people use an actor's likeness but not their voice
[3:18:21] <zenith0111> MOST FIGHTS ARE AVOIDABLE
[3:18:23] <CursedNobleman> Game grumps is approaching DSP, their Ocarina of Time and Majora playthroughs are hilariously terrible
[3:18:27] <Dakuu75> @Nina96 I imagine you could walk anywhere is you have the patience
[3:18:29] <OhioNitsud> how far north and south can you walk?
[3:18:37] <sirrice77> nope
[3:18:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Reminds me of that cut Terminator 3 scene where Arnold sounds southern
[3:18:41] <%RioGascar> I never have been more disappointed in a game. I just tried to follow an area where i climbed a shit ton of steep cliffs and shit thinking oh i‚Äôll be able to go OVER the mountain. SO SMART...it blocks construction.
[3:18:42] <%Run44forrest> DO IT THO
[3:18:42] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> thats quitter talk
[3:18:43] <Psyramics> not with that attitude
[3:18:44] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think so either
[3:18:45] <BinaryShuffle> You need to believe
[3:18:45] <Shastafield> leave it halfway
[3:18:46] <%LiquidShake83> do it
[3:18:47] <+jiggy_snipe> won't know til you try
[3:18:48] <Dakuu75> When can you build an AT-AT
[3:18:50] <+jiggy_snipe> so do it
[3:18:54] <DeliciousOrangeArt> You can use the bike, but it's hard.
[3:18:57] <%waifoong98> Just give it a jetpack Kappa
[3:18:57] <%Explodincatz> leave it halfway
[3:18:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> do it anyway
[3:19:01] <+jiggy_snipe> gj pat
[3:19:03] <+Punchasaur> I wonder if an actor-based character could ever get into smash
[3:19:05] <xGeneralDOOM> need dat high roads
[3:19:06] <jifbua> maybe
[3:19:08] <$HyperionXV> And the online signs say BTs in that area
[3:19:09] <deviljhojho_> its fuck you terrain
[3:19:09] <%SpcOpsBear> there is a valley you can try to get through
[3:19:09] <Gall108> You can

[3:46:45] <%augusm> anyone have any idea how many vehicle options there are in this game?
[3:46:46] <Dakuu75> man... everyone in the US gonna need to learn Kilos now instead of pounds
[3:46:47] <royaldicklick> TALL
[3:46:48] <NeroInfinite> yo that shit's lookin abit fucked
[3:46:54] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Pat, I want all the cargo on one bag, but I don't want the bag to be heavy.
[3:46:57] <%onlypuppet> Thanks, I‚Äôll pass it along at the memorial
[3:47:00] <SirFailsAlott> hey all, how far into the stream are we?
[3:47:09] <royaldicklick> BECOME TALLER
[3:47:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dakuu75 I'd rather die
[3:47:12] <Lunarmight> 100years in
[3:47:12] <savagedeviljayho> @Dakuu75 good that's the only proper way to measure weight
[3:47:13] <jifbua> store the bike?
[3:47:13] <Nina96> reverse time?
[3:47:13] <%Cozy90> !uptime
[3:47:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 47m.
[3:47:16] <Lunarmight> !uptimr
[3:47:21] <BinaryShuffle> that sway
[3:47:24] <Lunarmight> lol woops
[3:47:24] <+PolymorphicSushi> !uptime
[3:47:26] <SirFailsAlott> ayy nice thanks
[3:47:31] <deviljhojho_> just barely
[3:47:33] <based_versauen> I don‚Äôt need to learn kilos, just need to know what I can carry without tipping over every two steps.
[3:47:40] <+Punchasaur> The game is a metaphor of how Norman is carrying the walking dead on his back
[3:47:43] <%tri3dgE027> Sperm and Eggs? WutFace
[3:47:45] <Saunt> Does where the weight is matter since right now you are top heavy?
[3:47:46] <deviljhojho_> look man metric is the better system
[3:47:51] <deviljhojho_> meters and kilos is just better
[3:48:03] <Lunarmight> @saunt it matters
[3:48:05] <deviljhojho_> i will gladly die on this roadbump
[3:48:07] <+jiggy_snipe> does BT = beached things?
[3:48:08] <royaldicklick> I don't like math tho
[3:48:17] <based_versauen> No doubt, but I‚Äôm Merican and we do things the wrong way here. @deviljhojho_
[3:48:19] <ditalos> BT is ball torture
[3:48:24] <%Run44forrest> @Saunt yes you can strap things on to your suit to help with balance
[3:48:24] <zipfile777> what is red zone?
[3:48:25] <buffmurffy> nah but 100 degrees being hot makes sense tho Kappa
[3:48:28] <deviljhojho_> @based_versauen I can respect that gumption crikObject
[3:48:34] <Lunarmight> BT, is for BIG AND THICC
[3:48:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Kilos to pounds is easy. Multiply kilos by 2.2 (or if you're lazy, 2 and round up some).
[3:48:35] <+orionbearhunter> BT is Butt Touching
[3:48:37] <%BlackMage66652> 3D MAP
[3:48:39] <%Cozy90> @SirFailsAlott plot wise i dont think youve missed anything. pat almost got gead by a BT but thats about it
[3:48:51] <Manwad> bring roap and a latter
[3:48:57] <royaldicklick> BT will never fastball special you ever again FeelsBadMan
[3:49:06] <Lunarmight> @angriestpat DONT forget a towrl
[3:49:07] <jifbua> if you lose the bike can you rebuild it?
[3:49:08] <+Punchasaur> Booby Time
[3:49:10] <Lunarmight> towel*
[3:49:12] <%Run44forrest> wait so the baby is Big Boss?
[3:49:13] <TylerTjd> @AngriestPat looks like you might want more ropes
[3:49:15] <+hazardousfrk> Great Xmen 92 quote
[3:49:15] <%BlackMage66652> Store bike?
[3:49:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That seems unstable there boss.
[3:49:22] <%onlypuppet> I heard a rumor
[3:49:25] <+Javaa01> Put it in the Garage
[3:49:27] <SpaceGuntank> no, you gotta store it.
[3:49:27] <pabloelenano2> send it to the garage
[3:49:28] <+orionbearhunter> Big Boss Baby
[3:49:28] <deviljhojho_> So far the only BTs we have seen are the funky fetuses and the handprints boys. Unless they are the same thing....
[3:49:29] <Dragon_Batman> geared up for the mountains
[3:49:29] <Manwad> You can store it in the garage
[3:49:33] <+AllenDeadman> put it in the garage+
[3:49:35] <+Punchasaur> Bitch Tits
[3:49:39] <%thenumber5point5> yA EXTRA ROPE
[3:49:42] <rumuloh> Don't want to auto rearange your cargo? @AngriestPat
[3:49:42] <Dragon_Batman> I would store it just in case
[3:49:48] <Manwad> Also, you may be carrying too many grenades, 3 was more than enough for me
[3:49:53] <%onlypuppet> The last thing Jessica did was get married
[3:49:54] <ChrisM341> The baby is Big Smoke
[3:49:57] <Manwad> one packet of 'nades
[3:49:58] <BoneofMalkav> You can store it in Papyrus' Garage LUL
[3:50:23] <+Javaa01> You should probably store the EX grenades, since you have blood bombs now
[3:50:23] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[3:50:24] <based_versauen> BT‚Äôs are pretty easy to avoid, just go slow and steady.
[3:50:40] <LordWaldemaart> why is pat carrying three types of grenades?

[3:59:17] <jon651> Yeah the Bike would've gotten rekt
[3:59:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's like Kojima played QWOP and decided to make a new game around it
[3:59:25] <SolverCODO> @Lunarmight cum grenades when cummed ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
[3:59:26] <+SickBangerzM9> pat stop justifying your bike denial. you were right for once
[3:59:28] <qo_op> can't do a cum bomb cause it's november
[3:59:28] <based_versauen> I do wish the slowdown didn‚Äôt happen with every BT encounter but it‚Äôs not a big deal
[3:59:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> POO BOMB HIM
[3:59:32] <+AllenDeadman> monkaS
[3:59:34] <+Link232> Oh god all that destroyed stuff on the HUD -- someone wiped here probably
[3:59:34] <%Lost_Zombie> You sorta can. You can hop the bike and wheelies help you climb over stuff
[3:59:37] <%xcompleasedad> I think you were supposed to go right with with the bike, but that would have taken FOREVER
[3:59:38] <SpaceGuntank> all that destroyed cargo up ahead makes me think that someone actually tried to lol
[3:59:42] <Saunt> Image if nighttime was a thing
[3:59:44] <viciousgrim> so in theory you can pull out your wii a kill BT's
[3:59:48] <royaldicklick> I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS
[3:59:49] <konarius> you could have gottan a bike through that shit, that thing does 180s on the ramp this is literally "just go slow" zone
[3:59:50] <Lunarmight> @solvercodo or when they want cummies
[3:59:50] <Big_King_Coconut> hey pat did they ever explain why that one guy tried to stab himself to death when the BTs were lifting him into the air?
[3:59:51] <tigerfang86> spooky
[4:00:01] <OrphixPride> what are the x's?
[4:00:03] <jon651> holy shit someone rekt there stuff
[4:00:04] <Calamity2007> I love how this game even has a Dark Souls-like bloodstain mechanic
[4:00:05] <based_versauen> I tried to get the bike through this pass and it was a bad plan
[4:00:05] <%ape_hawk> why do I feel like killing BTs is a bad thing?
[4:00:13] <Dakuu75> I feel like Sam has a raw deal, being able to "sense" them but not SEE them like that other chick.
[4:00:14] <%derap41> Nothings spooky once you
[4:00:20] <Lunarmight> what's that smell guys?!

[4:00:26] <%SpcOpsBear> The X's are hard terrain that you can't really even traverse over
[4:00:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Watching this and your earlier VOD at the same time is weird. But at least I'll learn what the hell is going on.
[4:00:29] <%derap41> IS BLUD

[4:00:43] <xtremegamer80> Stonks
[4:00:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I feel like there was another game where the enemies weren't malevolent but just existing was bad for the protagonist.

[4:25:11] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat Could you play some in-game music for us while you're on deliveries?
[4:25:12] <mostundesired> The idea of this game having an antagonist, though.
[4:25:13] <%jackythefrost> Remember Big Boss canonically created Mountain Dew in Peace Walker @AngriestPat
[4:25:13] <+DZiffer> At the end they will fight over the BABY
[4:25:14] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Mads always looks evil though
[4:25:15] <%MisterVantes> I thought troy baker was the evil 1
[4:25:15] <Manjove> BIG EVIL
[4:25:18] <%Cozy90> what would a boss fight even look like against a person
[4:25:19] <Lunarmight> norman is the bb
[4:25:20] <transporterthesequel> Yeah he will 100% be after his BB
[4:25:21] <%JJCheeker> It's because he usually is
[4:25:21] <+Bipolarhernandez> Mads just wants his BB
[4:25:23] <%joylent_blue> sort your shit pat
[4:25:25] <dukenux> It's not Mads fault tht he looks like a villain, Pat
[4:25:27] <%GhostThane> lotta poop
[4:25:27] <devanmuse> i thought Mads and the Gold Masked Demens guy were the same dude for a while
[4:25:28] <Calamity2007> You look like a bulky human mobile suit
[4:25:28] <Louie_Salmon> Seems good
[4:25:29] <KanukMunch> !uptime
[4:25:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 25m.
[4:25:30] <%waifoong98> @jackythefrost he loves Doritos too
[4:25:32] <reonome> you probably don't need that many blood bags
[4:25:32] <alicespider> carrying so much literal shit
[4:25:32] <NeonBleu> looks like the game's pack mule
[4:25:33] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> DROP ALL YORU BOMBS
[4:25:34] <Louie_Salmon> It's a super light load
[4:25:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> If Mads isn;t the bads, then something is not right.
[4:25:39] <+grim_abel> More blood bags
[4:25:42] <fugnuggets01> MORE
[4:25:42] <royaldicklick> Who's the MAIN antagonist tho? Mads or Baker?
[4:25:47] <%Laecerelius> melt it down for a new one
[4:25:48] <%TDAWS_MP132> you have lots of stuff, but it's all light weight
[4:25:48] <reonome> yes
[4:25:50] <dukenux> It's only 30% dmg
[4:25:54] <%CoreyOfMyLife> logistics are the antagonist
[4:25:55] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> you don't need ladders or ropes for this next bit
[4:25:56] <%derap41> lot of volume not a lot of weight
[4:25:57] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat DROP ALL YOUR BOMBS, YOU NEE DTHE EXTRA WEIGHT
[4:25:57] <%joylent_blue> i missed the part with Baker FeelsBadMan
[4:25:58] <%ape_hawk> when do we see troy bakes?
[4:25:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Your repair spray is falling apart too
[4:26:00] <NeroInfinite> It's all mostly the grenades
[4:26:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Big Boss was the first person to Axe Body Spray his balls
[4:26:04] <%ape_hawk> i want my troy bakes
[4:26:06] <Dragon_Batman> As far as we know no one is an atagonist yet
[4:26:12] <$arcielardor> repair all
[4:26:14] <Dakuu75> you're carrying a pound of feathers
[4:26:15] <marlowe86> Really a Seinfeld reference? So 10 people who play this get the joke?
[4:26:15] <ditalos> @angriestpat logistics is actually a very important part of the military

[4:40:45] <Lord_of_all_Edges> I think it means you don't get fatigued?
[4:40:45] <royaldicklick> LUL
[4:40:45] <lloyddboy> YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME NOW
[4:40:46] <NeroInfinite> STACK IT UP HIGHER
[4:40:47] <%spiegelspike> LOOK AT THIS TOWER OF A MAN
[4:40:47] <TundraOW> Are you sure you aren't carrying enough?
[4:40:47] <Manwad> You still need something to hold the blood
[4:40:47] <CrimsonFox777> @StrifeZubia Gotta maximize storage ability.
[4:40:48] <+sixcubit> @StrifeZubia that's not armor, it's more cargo
[4:40:49] <+Bipolarhernandez> LUL
[4:40:49] <%StrifeZubia> But I thought chaos was a laddah
[4:40:49] <zepelinnn1> Jebaited
[4:40:50] <%derap41> D: all of the above
[4:40:51] <Icecreammouth> Why is Pat a tower of Pisa?
[4:40:51] <rumuloh> You have 5 grenades per stack, using them drains your health, but blood bags refil that health @AngriestPat
[4:40:52] <DeliciousOrangeArt> You still need grenades to throw your blood, but if you don't have blood bags you can use your body's blood.
[4:40:52] <mostundesired> Life is unfair
[4:40:52] <%Doruben> LUL
[4:40:53] <+Capt_Neckbeard> HA

[4:40:55] <dukenux> JENGA MAN
[4:40:55] <%treebeard24> LUL LUL
[4:40:55] <+Link232> Yeah you have multiple grenade,s but they draw from bags first, but then from your HP
[4:40:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> MAYBE
[4:40:56] <peachy996> YOU'RE NOT SO BIG
[4:40:56] <%floodtalon> If you have blood bags, you don't have to use your own blood to fill the grenades
[4:40:57] <+SickBangerzM9> maybe
[4:40:57] <royaldicklick> possibly
[4:40:58] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think you need a shit ton
[4:40:58] <Cybersoul666> @AngriestPat Each set has 5 shots. Then it goes empty
[4:40:58] <leothewhitelion> no
[4:40:59] <reonome> pat missed the reference LUL
[4:40:59] <faegbeard> AND YOU'RE NOT SO BIG
[4:40:59] <%Laecerelius> bring one grenade and a bunch of blood bags and see if the grenade goes away after you throw it
[4:40:59] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat No
[4:40:59] <+RowenCleric> is this game a fetish for just watching Norman Reedus grunt?
[4:40:59] <%crimsonharvest> can y ou look at the blood bags
[4:41:00] <+CharredChord> AND YOU'RE NOT SO BIG
[4:41:00] <leothewhitelion> perhaps
[4:41:01] <%Cozy90> MAYBE
[4:41:01] <SpaceGuntank> the joke flew over his head
[4:41:01] <LordWaldemaart> no, you have a finite amount of blood that is shared between grenades
[4:41:02] <MrDonTacos_> YO, NES
[4:41:02] <bone_reaper69> carry AT LEAST 10
[4:41:02] <+Capt_Neckbeard> GET MEMED
[4:41:03] <stealthfart> @louie_salmon You were right, I regret missing the Troy Baker part, but that‚Äôs looking to be it so far. I honestly wish I could have enjoyed this game.
[4:41:03] <Deimos002> Like, whatever man :)
[4:41:03] <%floodtalon> The grenade gets used whenever you throw it
[4:41:03] <%Doruben> You're not the boss of me

[4:41:17] <leothewhitelion> potentially yes
[4:41:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat they seem to be on cooldown and fill up constantly on the bags
[4:41:18] <leothewhitelion> but no

[4:41:30] <savagedeviljayho> millennials LUL
[4:41:32] <Katalist_> 50% of the time they don't every time

[4:41:36] <+Pachi3000> how many times do we have to teach you this lesson, boomer
[4:41:37] <+jcenderion> @AngriestPat That was blood refilling not grenades
[4:41:41] <sonicblade38> @AngriestPat based on what just happened that fight I think that in the final battle will have every 1 who gave u a like will become your stand
[4:41:41] <Manwad> No, each grenade is a canister.
[4:41:49] <%Nyanlathotep> @AngriestPat You need grenades to fill with your blood, the item in your inventory is the shell, and it's consumed when you throw it.
[4:41:51] <bone_reaper69> @AngriestPat Even if no blood bag it takes 10 to kill
[4:41:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> I thought this game was a walking simulator, but it's basically weaponized crossfit, huh?
[4:41:56] <Flame_Water> is this the new crack?
[4:41:56] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @savagedeviljayho Ok, Boomer.
[4:41:59] <Lunarmight> only a person with one arm is always right
[4:42:12] <Lunarmight> @savagedeviljayho ok Doomer
[4:42:12] <Camail> i dont think grenades refill
[4:42:15] <dukenux> blaze it
[4:42:20] <%waifoong98> so much notes
[4:42:21] <+Pachi3000> ya think
[4:42:22] <NeroInfinite> IT'S SUPER DENSE
[4:42:22] <+CharredChord> might?
[4:42:23] <%narusao> CNTRL-F
[4:42:23] <savagedeviljayho> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw orignal joke @Lunarmight now that's better
[4:42:24] <TurtleButter> maybe
[4:42:24] <%Finakala> Just like you
[4:42:25] <Big_King_Coconut> "might be"
[4:42:25] <JakxTheStampede> Boy is it
[4:42:25] <leothewhitelion> You dense motherfucker
[4:42:25] <%miguelrod777> maybe
[4:42:27] <%demegodz> A little
[4:42:28] <%Typhaeon> It's so dense, every frame has so much going on
[4:42:29] <Ipsenscastle> who'da thunk
[4:42:30] <%derap41> You wouldn't think so from a "walking simulator"
[4:42:30] <%rytisone> Woolie hates it
[4:42:30] <deviljhojho_> Perhaps
[4:42:30] <royaldicklick> @Lunarmight ok Bloomer
[4:42:30] <Camail> they'll use the blood from a blood bag before they use your blood, but they don't replenish
[4:42:31] <Nina96> !uptime
[4:42:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 42m.
[4:42:32] <Dr_Mooose> tips for your tips
[4:42:33] <CelestialOR> might be
[4:42:33] <artoflec> feature creep
[4:42:34] <hawkofgp> Aris already flushed this game
[4:42:35] <poweredscoot> It's hiking for accountants
[4:42:35] <Shadowanroid> just hopped in, whats pats opinion on DS?
[4:42:38] <%onlypuppet> No kidding?
[4:42:41] <Bigyin396> This game was made by autists for autists
[4:42:44] <lloyddboy> throwing weapons?
[4:42:46] <leothewhitelion> 6/10 GOTY
[4:42:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> I feel like Kojima needed someone to tell him some of his ideas were overcomplicated
[4:42:49] <Calamity2007> Dense as a neutron star
[4:42:50] <$Jmann1892> A Kojima game that might be dense? Impossible
[4:42:51] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Eack pack has 5 and only 5
[4:42:53] <Sol_Install> oh carins
[4:42:55] <Louie_Salmon> @angriestpat there's moves you haven't even done with normal Reedus yet
[4:43:00] <StripesUltimateEdition> @Bigyin396 yikes
[4:43:00] <%floodtalon> Whenever you use a hematic grenade its used forever Pat
[4:43:01] <dukenux> Its so dense.
[4:43:02] <Sol_Install> so that was a carin that help us out
[4:43:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dense like Sam's colon with all the Monster‚Ñ¢ branded energy drinks he pounds down
[4:43:05] <Lunarmight> at least I can bloom lol
[4:43:11] <savagedeviljayho> @hawkofgp aris is an idiot that doesn't read and has the attention span of a goldfish tho
[4:43:13] <%waifoong98> would really help to add a search bar in this tips
[4:43:13] <Nina96> 12hrs in i think we had our first fight poor woolie is gonna hate this game
[4:43:16] <ChrisM341> Do you guys/gals think there will be a Kojima cameo in this game?
[4:43:16] <Ipsenscastle> deep peepoops lore
[4:43:19] <%tri3dgE027> Yes :)
[4:43:20] <dukenux> Every menu had so much things going on
[4:43:20] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> no you didnt
[4:43:20] <%floodtalon> Think of it like an actual grenade, you cant reuse grenades when they explode
[4:43:20] <Dragon_Batman> I saw it too
[4:43:21] <dan_g_v> vey chat peoples. did pat turn his piss and blood into monster energy?
[4:43:22] <%aishman> Throw one
[4:43:23] <+jcenderion> YEAH YOU STILL LOSE GRENADES
[4:43:23] <lxNicNacxl> The tooltip pat!
[4:43:24] <%ChaosAethr> Your pick up others
[4:43:25] <%aishman> And see what happan
[4:43:25] <%chiluzza> @AngriestPat each grenade is a clip
[4:43:25] <Sol_Install> i saw it too
[4:43:27] <transporterthesequel> that did 100% happen
[4:43:29] <neon_z1> CRAZY TALK
[4:43:29] <Bigyin396> This is bad game design
[4:43:30] <%crimsonharvest> it probably fills with your blood, which was auto refilling from the bag
[4:43:30] <%tri3dgE027> Remember the White-Goo guys?
[4:43:31] <LordWaldemaart> no the blood bag filled up
[4:43:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no
[4:43:32] <%waifoong98> Test it out may be?
[4:43:33] <Bigyin396> make these things clear
[4:43:34] <hawkofgp> @savagedeviljayho that is a harsh but fair synapsis
[4:43:34] <JakxTheStampede> Maybe it fills up with your blood, and then Blood Bag refill you
[4:43:37] <+Pachi3000> Try it again and see wha happun
[4:43:38] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> if Sam drink pruple drinks will it make his poo bombs stronger?
[4:43:39] <%onlypuppet> Is that really what happened?
[4:43:41] <qo_op> insanity
[4:43:41] <%Nyanlathotep> @AngriestPat You still need the Grenade item, they ALSO consume blood from you or a bag in addition to being limited by how many you're carrying.
[4:43:42] <NeroInfinite> It was the grenade it was your blood gauge
[4:43:45] <ditalos> @angriestpat the game seems pretty easy tbh you aced that boss fight
[4:43:45] <xGeneralDOOM> maybe u picked from the floor
[4:43:45] <+jcenderion> BLOOD IS NOT GRENADES PAT.
[4:43:46] <NeroInfinite> wasn't*
[4:43:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i don't believe you
[4:43:47] <jmft2000> @jmft2000 is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[4:43:47] <Scrub_Seeker> @AngriestPat the grenades use blood as ammo, but you have a limited number of grenades
[4:43:47] <Manwad> Pat, imagine that you bleed gunpowder and that you have fragmentation grenades as an item
[4:43:50] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat You were picking up Others on the Field
[4:43:50] <%joylent_blue> i had to leave at the start of the Higgs convo what did i miss
[4:43:50] <TheAspiringWriter> GUYS The grenade DID refill
[4:43:51] <+Godjaw> The grenades recharge from your blood meter, which blood bags refilll
[4:43:52] <DeliciousOrangeArt> @AngriestPat You saw your HP being refilled via the bloodbag, you need physical grenades to throw, but each grenade automatically fills with your blood.
[4:43:54] <Brofarian> What a mysterious jogo
[4:43:55] <lloyddboy> THROWING WEAPONS
[4:43:56] <+studiocomfy> if you look at the description of the grenade it says it will fill up with sams blood if there's no blood bag available
[4:43:56] <+OblivionSword1> it's said so in the item description is it not ?
[4:43:57] <%PanicSwytch> The equipment on his back is getting insane. No person would be able to carry all that.
[4:43:57] <GobblesInTheMist> @AngriestPat Hows Hermit Crab Simulator?
[4:43:58] <gonzy92> teat it
[4:44:04] <+jcenderion> THAT WAS JUST BLOOD REFILLING CAUSE ITS BLOOD
[4:44:05] <+Caped_Eggy> I also thought It happened
[4:44:06] <%THATGUY_789> it says it does on the item info doesn't it
[4:44:06] <Lunarmight> grenade doesn't kill enemies, grenades kill you SeemsGood
[4:44:06] <TurtleButter> LUL
[4:44:07] <LordWaldemaart> (0)
[4:44:08] <Manwad> After throwing, you can't get the shell back
[4:44:08] <%TDAWS_MP132> pretty sure it was just refiling your blood
[4:44:11] <%GhostThane> lol blocked
[4:44:11] <%Run44forrest> its really light
[4:44:12] <bone_reaper69> @AngriestPat it takes 10 to kill without blood bags, so 10 total should be plenty with bag
[4:44:12] <%floodtalon> Ok thats air
[4:44:12] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> You can't pat
[4:44:12] <Dragon_Batman> You need to step out of the zone to use it
[4:44:14] <+Pachi3000> YOU'RE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE WEAPONS IN THIS ROOM, SAMUS
[4:44:14] <dan_g_v> elmo could v
[4:44:14] <%honeyman18> Fuck is he still goin'm
[4:44:15] <%CrimsonCore90> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead it happened y'all
[4:44:17] <NicholasKane> 1000/1000 is the blood, (0) is the number of grenades
[4:44:18] <%crimsonharvest> it says right there on the text
[4:44:18] <%floodtalon> Go outside to check
[4:44:24] <+jcenderion> HIGHER
[4:44:27] <Louie_Salmon> Might be because you're in a city?
[4:44:28] <Big_King_Coconut> STACK MAN
[4:44:28] <dakkster> my god, thoes boxes
[4:44:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Chainsawman taught me that grenades are scary
[4:44:34] <%Nyanlathotep> @AngriestPat You still need the Grenade item, they ALSO consume blood from you or a bag in addition to being limited by how many you're carrying.
[4:44:37] <dakkster> CAN YOU TAKE ME HIGHER
[4:44:38] <dan_g_v> i meant elmo is strong enough to carry all that
[4:44:40] <%Laecerelius> Pat's ready to fight a fucking army of BTs with all that blood
[4:44:42] <%THATGUY_789> it says on the item txt it refills with blood bag
[4:44:46] <Brofarian> Pat's crazy talk will cause cascading errors when he removes whole mechanics
[4:44:49] <pineapple_clock> he's got bionic legs so he can carry a lot
[4:44:51] <%floodtalon> You have five grenades, but 1000 blood
[4:44:54] <%crimsonharvest> that seems pretty clear to me
[4:44:55] <%Doruben> haend grenar
[4:44:58] <%IDTheftVictim> how many corpses is that?
[4:44:58] <+Link232> What you saw refueling was your blood regening, not the grenades
[4:44:59] <%TDAWS_MP132> well there we go
[4:45:01] <Sol_Install> wait... so you must have blood bags then
[4:45:02] <%floodtalon> Blood is your health
[4:45:06] <Sol_Install> otherwise you DIE
[4:45:07] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat BLIND
[4:45:07] <NicholasKane> the 1000/1000 is your health
[4:45:07] <%Doruben> the grenades refill
[4:45:07] <%DonatelloJose> Just got here. This looks fucking silly.
[4:45:09] <%CoreyOfMyLife> grenaiyd
[4:45:13] <Lunarmight> not blood bags. blood vials
[4:45:13] <+Javaa01> You don't have any grenades in the case that it could fill with blood
[4:45:13] <%StrifeZubia> What's that smell
[4:45:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> sam is filled with 1000 blood
[4:45:15] <%Run44forrest> pat your blood is a consumable
[4:45:20] <NicholasKane> the (0) or (5) is the number of grenades in that stack
[4:45:20] <konarius> so you just have the container with no nades in it and they draw blood when thrown?
[4:45:24] <%joylent_blue> holy fuck pat you're stacked
[4:45:24] <Dragon_Batman> Nah exo-skeletons exist, he is just a man doing this
[4:45:28] <Brofarian> Those are some tight legos
[4:45:29] <+SickBangerzM9> i hope this game isnt frontloaded with content meaning the other 90% is barren nothing

[5:28:39] <Ipsenscastle> I hope this game makes a point to publishers about how metacritic doesnt equate to financial viability. Niche things can super succeed as long as you confidently target the right demo

[5:33:28] <Dragon_Batman> @floralkami Totally but last thing i'll say is that he quit his twitch job and being a face in the FGC because of the direction it's going and disappeared and it's just a small bummer cuz he is a kool dood. Just happy to see he is doing good tho.

[5:36:33] <%honeyman18> Antimatter
[5:36:34] <+restivewolf> yessssss
[5:36:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Nothing matters lol
[5:36:34] <+ledgefiendd> wow that art in your layout is outstanding
[5:36:35] <+MechaBaphomet> almost like a void Kappa
[5:36:35] <+PerrinIsDead> I just got here so idk
[5:36:38] <Fear_Ranjer> awwww
[5:36:38] <cureneckbeard> get well soon page
[5:36:38] <+Vayatan> D:
[5:36:41] <buffmurffy> hece void
[5:36:41] <%Rumbutt> @AngriestPat Seems similar to a matter/antimatter annihilation
[5:36:41] <alicespider> The term Void Out seems appropriate for what it does
[5:36:41] <ShoggothLord> It's great boss!
[5:36:41] <NeroInfinite> Might be antimatter yeah
[5:36:42] <+kiiiirsten> Pat crushed her pussy
[5:36:42] <Fear_Ranjer> Hope she feels better
[5:36:43] <+AllenDeadman> they're just ctrl + alt + del
[5:36:44] <VirtuaRailith> tell paige to get better
[5:36:45] <Edible_Enthusiasm> down with the sickness
[5:36:46] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Having an opinion for Death Stranding that isn't "This is the best game in the history of everything" seems to be too controversial and makes people hate you
[5:36:47] <Deimos002> BibleThump give her our well wishes
[5:36:47] <+Eclipse_knight_> because antimatter
[5:36:47] <%WhereIsWill> this game rocks apatDab apatDab apatDab
[5:36:48] <peachy996> Throw bees at her
[5:36:48] <%joylent_blue> feel better paige :(
[5:36:49] <Dragon_Batman> As long as she is ok, sall good
[5:36:52] <%rytisone> stream from bed
[5:36:53] <Dr_Mooose> got to see an hour and a half, so time for the vod
[5:36:53] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> hope she feels better soon
[5:36:59] <%Run44forrest> feed paige a bug
[5:37:00] <Ipsenscastle> build a wall between 'murica and the bitch ass ghosts
[5:37:00] <dekkitout> Man that Star Wars DS poster is rad
[5:37:03] <Mexrage> send her our "get better and that she is big and strong"
[5:37:15] <%Deano8817> make us whole again isaac
[5:37:15] <deviljhojho_> perhaps
[5:37:21] <%joylent_blue> whaaaaaat
[5:37:23] <Manjove> they did describe it as Anihilation
[5:37:23] <Dakuu75> yeah, I can see that
[5:37:23] <%honeyman18> I do love hiking, so I have a weird love for it so far.
[5:37:24] <%joylent_blue> noooooooo
[5:37:25] <undeuxtroisqua> is there any kind of collectibles around the world? not currency or materials but trophies of some sort
[5:37:27] <+PerrinIsDead> @terminallycapriciousz Tbh the game just looks too Kohima-ey for me
[5:37:29] <+jcenderion> AMELIE IS FRENCH FOR A FAKE SOUL
[5:37:29] <Dakuu75> higs might be a good guy lol
[5:37:30] <Dragon_Batman> Definitely feels that way
[5:37:30] <bigbeefbeatin> @terminallycapriciousz Game looks pretty boring
[5:37:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How could you not trust the beautiful women in red?
[5:37:32] <%Cozy90> IS DEADMAN EVIL?
[5:37:33] <QaizerArt> @AngriestPat MAKE US WHOLE, ISAAC
[5:37:35] <Lord_of_all_Edges> #Gendo did nothing wrong.
[5:37:37] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> AMELIE IS A PRINCESS, SHUT UP PAT
[5:37:37] <%derap41> I think higgs will turn out good
[5:37:37] <dekkitout> And Troy is Troy
[5:37:39] <TungstenViper> FACTS 100%
[5:37:39] <MasterCosmic> What if someone has a miscarriage? Would it go nuclear too?
[5:37:40] <+SkaiVibration> probs but we'll see how it goes down init, i think that's what'll b emost interesting
[5:37:42] <UchiVsTheWorld> now thats a jebait
[5:37:43] <Mexrage> so...Hannibal is The Boss?
[5:37:46] <%onlypuppet> Good Night, King
[5:37:49] <Dragon_Batman> I think Madds will have a selfish goal
[5:37:51] <%Bananamanstan> Cheer100 wish me luck pat, moving to Chicago tomorrow from my hobunk back water town. Plan on watching you on my phone till I get my internet back
[5:38:01] <dukenux> Mads is a hero and Amelie is a villain
[5:38:03] <Ipsenscastle> The time rain seems like a big Chekhov's Gun. I'm calling finishing the game as Old Reedus.
[5:38:03] <deviljhojho_> disgostang
[5:38:03] <xtremegamer80> Ironically the mind goblins are not as active
[5:38:04] <%terminallyCapriciousz> I don't hate it, but it definitely isn't something I'd likely sit down to play myself. Too long, the gameplay doesn't appeal to me, but I can still sit back and appreciate it from a distance
[5:38:11] <%PanicSwytch> And Higgs is a nut case that was right all along
[5:38:13] <Big_King_Coconut> the goblins are making pat carry 30 grenades everywhere
[5:38:27] <DragonArt07> the only disappointing thing for me is the monster energy drink
[5:38:31] <cureneckbeard> that's what norman reedus' baby is. it's a stream baby
[5:38:33] <KohryuZX> to be fair, at this point what the fuck hope is left IF NOT for a human instrumentality type thing? THe world's FUCKED!
[5:38:45] <%Run44forrest> how is the monster ad dissapointing
[5:38:56] <%honeyman18> Patt hoarding his piss and shit because the mind goblins wont let him waste consumables. and Paige is scared.
[5:39:00] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> to be fair, you need to have a high IQ to understand Death Stranding...
[5:39:05] <%waifoong98> LUL

[5:39:11] <+SaintSucc> !uptime
[5:39:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 39m.
[5:39:12] <Dragon_Batman> The sacrifice, longer but safer or shorter but more dangerous
[5:39:13] <xtremegamer80> HOW?
[5:39:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYE
[5:39:14] <Dakuu75> FOR THE LOLS hahahaha

[5:39:25] <%waifoong98> Smart architecture Kappa
[5:39:27] <bigbeefbeatin> When someone dies from diabetes from drinking all those monsters do they go double nuclear from all the garbage they‚Äôve been drinking
[5:39:29] <%Lost_Zombie> Yeah you can skip over a shit ton of really nasty rocks with it
[5:39:33] <+michingmallecho> The best person
[5:39:43] <SpaceGuntank> they probably got super tired of all the bad terrain LUL
[5:39:46] <pineapple_clock> are you going to be watching Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC
[5:39:48] <Ipsenscastle> Does Paige want to kiss Higgs
[5:39:58] <mayorrev> ewww
[5:40:03] <Deimos002> Do not skeetus the feetus D:
[5:40:05] <%Deano8817> Norman Reedus Yeetus his Feetus
[5:40:05] <xtremegamer80> I feel like the only egregious thing at this point is the on-the-nose thing in the interviews
[5:40:06] <DragonArt07> pat any idea if Woolie will be streaming this?
[5:40:06] <%joylent_blue> don't like that one
[5:40:18] <%Run44forrest> wtf its good

[5:41:00] <alwayspronking> crazy talk activate?
[5:41:03] <%honeyman18> Woolie would punch the ghosts with shit soaked fists.
[5:41:04] <natscazz> Jim also isn't too keen on this right?
[5:41:04] <+michingmallecho> Woolie hates running
[5:41:05] <%rytisone> one weird game, Woolie hates it
[5:41:06] <+donpatrondx> Woolie is gonna SPITE LOVE this game
[5:41:07] <cureneckbeard> crazey talk.
[5:41:08] <+michingmallecho> KappaHD
[5:41:09] <dekkitout> Hate to play or hate to watch, or both?
[5:41:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie wants do combo
[5:41:10] <Dragon_Batman> Or at the very least will see it in his own time
[5:41:10] <+PerrinIsDead> It‚Äôs not a fighting game so he not play it
[5:41:11] <DragonArt07> yeah woolie is a bit of an action junkie
[5:41:15] <%MelBrooksKA> Anti-Woolie

[5:41:22] <+jcenderion> Like a movie?
[5:41:22] <shiny_prinny> it's ok to like non-fun games
[5:41:23] <NeroInfinite> This is woolie posion
[5:41:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeah
[5:41:26] <dekkitout> This game is very cinematic oriented
[5:41:27] <Jontman42> I understand that
[5:41:27] <jon651> Satisfying? how?
[5:41:27] <LixFury> No combo make woolie sad
[5:41:27] <CatmanIX> looks like tedium: the game
[5:41:27] <+AllenDeadman> no big combo = no woolie game
[5:41:30] <alwayspronking> no travel combos, I feel it
[5:41:30] <Ipsenscastle> Woolie demands pee combos
[5:41:31] <%waifoong98> I am more shocked that Max is going to continue this game
[5:41:31] <%ABajaChalupa> @AngriestPat no homo
[5:41:34] <%demegodz> The Anti-Indivisible
[5:41:35] <+michingmallecho> This game is...THIS GAME
[5:41:35] <rumuloh> All about numbers and walking in the right direction aka not for woolie
[5:41:40] <%valriot> I kind of disagree, it is pretty fun
[5:41:40] <+ZenVulgarity> this would kill woolie
[5:41:40] <+VoytekBus> so like my pretend sex life then
[5:41:41] <poweredscoot> "What if Breath of the Wild was boring... on purpose?"
[5:41:41] <+Link232> You fought the hydra BT boss as well
[5:41:42] <%Run44forrest> woolie shows up to the podcast in full BRIDGES gear
[5:41:43] <jack_s1n> woolie loves papers please
[5:41:44] <%Laecerelius> And throw shit grenades at them
[5:41:45] <Dragon_Batman> That and the boss fight
[5:41:45] <+Caped_Eggy> I mean you can go buck wild with the BTs
[5:41:46] <%rytisone> also Boss
[5:41:47] <xtremegamer80> It's somehow more cinematic than David Cage's moviegames
[5:41:48] <+AllenDeadman> and then you threw blood at the ghost
[5:41:49] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Caramel admitted defeat the other day
[5:41:50] <%MelBrooksKA> No short haired punch girls
[5:41:50] <HoboCabs> you did throw pee and poo at a monster thats fun
[5:41:50] <+trustycoyote> Couldn't you say the intrigue and putting the pieces together fun though?
[5:41:51] <alwayspronking> LUL
[5:41:51] <Xyall> is this game just the genre opposite of Indivisible?
[5:41:51] <Caidezes> LUL

[5:42:02] <%Run44forrest> oh no hes gonna get lost
[5:42:04] <natscazz> It's a game about family
[5:42:04] <Ape_Law> @AngriestPat Its literally a walking simulator
[5:42:05] <+luketrapwalker> A game about logistics sounds interesting to me LUL
[5:42:05] <koolaid_kevster> you threw poop grenades @AngriestPat
[5:42:10] <AMaidIndeed> I think sugar free monster is better than regular monster, am I wrong?
[5:42:16] <%valriot> @angriestpat Woolie looking for depth in Nier Automata was painful and not the point of that game
[5:42:16] <%Run44forrest> yes
[5:42:17] <MasterCosmic> Woolie getting lost LUL
[5:42:18] <jack_s1n> woolie loves papers please so he might like this
[5:42:19] <Frozenflame01> @AngriestPat so which country do you think doesn't exist anymore in the death stranding universe
[5:42:20] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's funny, I'm watching your first VOD and the whole time you're talking about how the VOD will be muted. And yet it isn't. Guess they're slow to mute.
[5:42:28] <+michingmallecho> This game teaches you to remember the basics of cargo loading
[5:42:34] <+OkamiDude15> attache case simulator

[5:42:58] <Dragon_Batman> Wow they haven't muted the vod? that's astounding
[5:42:58] <+michingmallecho> It makes know how a drug mule feels
[5:43:02] <+Eclipse_knight_> ok i need to sleep, night everybody
[5:43:11] <+VoytekBus> are there any type of funzies in this game?
[5:43:15] <dekkitout> A paranormal eurotruck simulator seems about right
[5:43:15] <cureneckbeard> Norman Reedus and his stream baby
[5:43:28] <NeroInfinite> You can throw poop and pee at the ghosts
[5:43:35] <%Piemen99> yeah donty do that
[5:43:37] <%joylent_blue> VoytekBus does peeing on a bike and having a mushroom grow on it count as funzies
[5:43:38] <Dakuu75> that sounds like a Pat-stream problem. "I spilled my hot wings"
[5:43:39] <cureneckbeard> UNO
[5:43:39] <%honeyman18> If there is art, should Pat or PP be the baby?
