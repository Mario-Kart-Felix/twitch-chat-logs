[0:22:21] <@lewdskeletor13> Why is the wang so sinister?
[0:22:22] <%BioApple> pat where is your CUBE
[0:22:23] <%probablypoisonous> probablypoisonous converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:22:26] <ChamoCamouflage> What do you call a Father Pat?
[0:22:28] <@commanderclaw> Why are Healers bitching so much?
[0:22:29] <%Nikopol1717> Mood
[0:22:35] <%MasterDecoder> @Reisadan Because smug
[0:22:36] <%Mornaka> hmm
[0:22:45] <Dio_TR> WE THE PAT ARMY BOIS
[0:22:45] <+BurkeBigsby> Service was right.
[0:22:47] <%shawntk_> @commanderclaw Because they keep not adding in new healer classes
[0:22:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Streams as a service
[0:22:51] <axelkaspar> The Gaze Agenda!
[0:22:52] <BunnyEmperor> Do it
[0:22:57] <Prism_Wing> @chamocamouflage Patriarch Kappa
[0:23:00] <%Frost_Quill> Elmo is Pat's dad AND his son? something something YOUR MOM IS YOUR AUNT'S SISTER.
[0:23:01] <@mothmandraws> oh no
[0:23:01] <ChamoCamouflage> Ooh
[0:23:01] <%Mornaka> DONT STAND IN THE FIRE
[0:23:02] <+ChaosVulpes> Cause Healers are bitches!
[0:23:04] <%Typhaeon> When are healers not bitching?
[0:23:05] <ChamoCamouflage> That's a good one @Prism_Wing
[0:23:06] <%Sabre_Basilisk> Because thats what healers do
[0:23:08] <%Ascethetic> watch it
[0:23:10] <Daniel_Is_I> Healer wanna damage but they no damage
[0:23:15] <Reisadan> I know smug, but why smug? (and healers bitch because we gotta KEEP Y'ALL COHERENT)
[0:23:22] <%Master_Van> Cuz Healers
[0:23:22] <Jetsfantasy> 1) When was the last time they got a class 2) Dancer became DPS
[0:23:30] <Tucker0603> Paladin has me with the biggest dickus
[0:23:40] <transporterthesequel> That is because tanks are BIG MAN DPS NAO O YEEEEE
[0:23:41] <+HeyBoston> overall, square tells healers to get back in the heal-kitchen
[0:23:41] <RavenHellkite> they'll buff the healers when they can't get through duties
[0:23:46] <%probablypoisonous> @probablypoisonous is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[0:23:50] <+cvp5127> its true
[0:23:50] <%BioApple> just like real doctors
[0:23:50] <%Mornaka> that's fair
[0:23:50] <%gespenst25> I love my new combo. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
[0:23:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Accurate.
[0:23:51] <%MegboyManuel> Paladin best tank now
[0:23:52] <%VioletHeart> Their core damage abilities are stronger though.
[0:23:52] <StaticSunrise> YOU DID THIS TO US
[0:23:53] <%Gespens> It's true
[0:23:54] <%Ascethetic> yep
[0:23:55] <Daniel_Is_I> Can confirm. Healed in WoW.
[0:23:56] <$Valdorick> The heal bitches are rebelling! Get the whips out again!
[0:24:01] <@SSaryn> Me and Strident are one of them!
[0:24:02] <transporterthesequel> I have not healed since Wrath and I am still scarred
[0:24:02] <+ChaosVulpes> Yeah, healing others siphons your own soul away
[0:24:06] <%kujofire990> cheer100 Thanks alot Pat for getting me into FF14. Already LV30 MRD getting ready to get that first job with WAR.
[0:24:06] <Jetsfantasy> Yes, am WHM. I let people die just cause I enjoy watching dumbasses die
[0:24:07] <ChamoCamouflage> Healers are people we don't deserve, but need.
[0:24:08] <%Mornaka> They're all ungrateful
[0:24:09] <%ECRead> I am a bitter jaded person. this is all correct
[0:24:09] <%ElenaManetta> I'm pretty sure no one wants to be Medic in TF2 is why they started giving every class their own self-healing item
[0:24:11] <alrobot2014> becoming the arbiter of life and death really does a workover on the ole soul
[0:24:11] <vVAstrAVv> can confirm healing ruins souls
[0:24:11] <%Typhaeon> They lack aggressive skills so they have to be passive-aggressive
[0:24:13] <odiemikes> I've never healed once and my soul is all ready ruined
[0:24:15] <Necropony> Wait how did scholar get trimmed down
[0:24:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> nu, but I needs mah heal slut kink!
[0:24:16] <ape_hawk> healing is just keeping dumbasses who STAND IN THE BAD CIRCLES alive for no reason
[0:24:18] <BunnyEmperor> Just reduce Assize cooldown to 5 seconds, fixed
[0:24:19] <%snow_bush> its like playing a Gatcha in another game
[0:24:21] <SpaceGuntank> trying to heal the stupid people will make anyone bitter over time
[0:24:21] <%Mornaka> ungrateful for my loving heals
[0:24:22] <Undreas> What are we talking about? I got here 2 seconds ago. monkaS
[0:24:23] <CaptainFrankincense> nah doing anything hurts healers
[0:24:26] <vVAstrAVv> nannying you idiots sucks lol
[0:24:26] <%ElenaManetta> Just like real life doctors
[0:24:29] <@SSaryn> AST are damage giving sluts now, not heal sluts
[0:24:29] <%Frost_Quill> Can confirm I'm leveling White Mage and I hate everyone in my fucking party and then I get at least 2 commendations every dungeon which is nice I guess.
[0:24:29] <Dellappatca> As a passive aggressive bitch, I love being a healer
[0:24:30] <%MegboyManuel> I heal as a PLD, it counts
[0:24:30] <+HeyBoston> can confirm, I'm a very jaded whm
[0:24:31] <odiemikes> Jaded Healers are best
[0:24:33] <%Ascethetic> i hate dps
[0:24:34] <ChamoCamouflage> Is it like real life doctors
[0:24:35] <+BurkeBigsby> freedom is a dancer. Some would even say a soul companion.
[0:24:38] <%Typhaeon> Imagine having to focus on everyone's fuck ups as your class mechanic
[0:24:39] <%crimsonharvest> As a healer you get to watch every idiot in the game walk directly to damage zones and plant their asses in, and never move
[0:24:39] <Angry_Ev1L> because BIG NUMBERS
[0:24:40] <Jetsfantasy> Healing is a babysitter
[0:24:40] <$Valdorick> Because you'll heal it, duh @AngriestPat
[0:24:41] <1matheuw> pat is a heal slut confirmed
[0:24:44] <%spacehouse> Healers sit front and center watching the collectiive stupidity of humanity
[0:24:45] <%ArcanumMBD> Why move when the healer can heal you?
[0:24:47] <%Niney_Who> That's the Canonical Reasoning for the Medic in TF2. Healing is just a side effect of him experimenting and killing
[0:24:48] <%Laecerelius> I don't need to deal with mechanics, I have a healer!
[0:24:49] <%Intersceptre> Hot Take: Tanks have it worse than healers but they have the emotional stability to deal with their issues. Healers are just babbies.
[0:24:50] <Reisadan> Get. Out. Of. The. Fire. You. Absolute. Puff. Muffin.
[0:24:50] <scrumbotime> "Get out of the big glowing circle you idiots."
[0:24:51] <Daniel_Is_I> I healed for a long time and then became a DPS and now I make it my goal to reduce healer load as much as possible
[0:24:51] <+primax104> the MMO engine eh
[0:24:52] <%arcaderabbit48> As a Healer main, Pat is really super right. A lot of Healers seem like they dont actually want to heal??
[0:24:54] <%Master_Van> Because heals
[0:24:54] <%gespenst25> @AngriestPat Healing doesn't make me jaded. The fact that the devs don't understand what we enjoy from the classes makes me jaded.
[0:24:55] <Delenay> at least it isnt "why arent you standing in my healing aoe"
[0:24:56] <BunnyEmperor> BECAUSE MUH DPS
[0:24:59] <SolaireGarde> the bitterness fuels me
[0:25:02] <rytisone> Pat is a star
[0:25:02] <+Dead_trickster> healers adjust! /s
[0:25:03] <Dio_TR> Remember guys thank your Nurses because without them doctors would kill you
[0:25:09] <%SWFanatic> shake it
[0:25:09] <@mothmandraws> im training to be good dragoon, its nice game gives me these big orange areas to tell me where to stand, they are bright like a lamp
[0:25:09] <@SSaryn> I JUST WANNA THROW STONES AT PEOPLE OK
[0:25:11] <%DavidSanChan> Pat is delegated to my second monitor only
[0:25:12] <%VioletHeart> Or you can be me and be worried about everyone if they take even the tiniest nick of damage. I have to be party mom and if anyone gets hurt I blame myself.

[0:33:57] <$Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid500 i had a bit of a galaxy brain moment this week; in talking about GoT and its ending and how they might haave done it better, i had a realization that Dragon Age: Origins, a game i adore, has a lot of the same elements to its finale as GoT does, only done currectly; even to the point of having a nigh-identical main threat, complete with a dragon; this game from ten years ago managed to pull off what GoT couldn't pull off in that same ten years. TL;DR Dragon Age > Game of Thrones

[1:00:39] <%greenhathero> yeyeye
[1:00:40] <StarMechV> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, I'm stuck on one of the Ixal Beast Quests. The quest itself said that min. I needed lv 15 of a craft class, but building the components I need seem to be almost impossible. I'm a 27 leatherworker, what do I do?
[1:00:40] <%Wynzler> It wouldn't be an issue if it was easier to target things as a ranged dps
[1:00:44] <%MasterDecoder> @SGrim Ok, I stand corrected, Haru is a cutie
[1:00:45] <%Dkun4> Rant! Rant! Rant!
[1:00:56] <%supersmolman> @sgrim ive haven't seen those but I am now after this futaba is my favorite character and then haru being a close second
[1:00:56] <Mr_pwng3> i shoudlve started stockipiling content of his to watch before the loveletter i thought i would be safe until it actually came out, i was wrong
[1:01:00] <@mothmandraws> what if everyone else is wrong
[1:01:01] <%Typhaeon> Diversion exists
[1:01:03] <jijipose> AOE is for suckers, single target DPS RIDE OR DIE
[1:01:05] <$Valdorick> What's that!? Focus Tank and never attack what he's targeting!?
[1:01:07] <%Cervantas> as a healer I do let those DPS die
[1:01:12] <%Chichen> STORMBRINGERS
[1:01:12] <%TDotGoat> nah man, alpha strike that one guy

[1:01:43] <%weissguard> Tbf, Stormbringers is a pretty sick Expansion name.
[1:01:44] <StarMechV> Stormbringers, Stormsward, Heavenblood...
[1:01:44] <%spiritofmojave> Correct
[1:01:45] <%skizzuto> so what's the proper way to use it
[1:01:46] <flakari> TANKS SHOULD TANK BETTER
[1:01:47] <Tucker0603> DPS are morons
[1:01:47] <+lucaflow> Truth
[1:01:50] <+Shadicara> Put pat how do they hit the people with the big stick for big numbers
[1:01:52] <ReiDuran> I'm a dumb PLD and I love the changes I don't care
[1:01:52] <%nyurgh> I can confirm that I am too dumb to diversion
[1:01:54] <flakari> DEAL WITH MY DAMAGE
[1:01:58] <jijipose> Healers and Tanks are eternally suffering
[1:01:58] <%MasterDecoder> @SGrim I did not, as I said, no PS4, so it'll be a while
[1:02:00] <%spiritofmojave> WHM is pain still
[1:02:00] <%Typhaeon> Also Elusive Jump is now much less useful thanks
[1:02:04] <+lucaflow> As a DPS/Tank main yeah DPS are big dumbs
[1:02:06] <BunnyEmperor> Correct 100% fact
[1:02:13] <StarMechV> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, I'm stuck on one of the Ixal Beast Quests. The quest itself said that min. I needed lv 15 of a craft class, but building the components I need seem to be almost impossible. I'm a 27 leatherworker, what do I do? 9-Month Subscriber (6-Month Badge)Twitch Primegreenhathero: yeyeye
[1:02:16] <+lucaflow> No Pat some Healers are just as dumb
[1:02:17] <+khalcipher> Is that the Dante color scheme? @AngriestPat
[1:02:20] <+Shadicara> Everyone needs to adjust around my damage
[1:02:22] <Mr_pwng3> does the healer tank race war start when?
[1:02:24] <%Laecerelius> Yeah
[1:02:26] <AdmiralButtloaf> just open with diversion and theres no issues
[1:02:34] <%Dkun4> BUt diVeRSiOn Is a DpS lOSs
[1:02:34] <%Laecerelius> It starts out rough
[1:02:35] <%luftraumm1> nothing happens
[1:02:35] <zepelinnn> "hold aggro even tho im spamming fire 2 and not using diversion BabyRage "
[1:02:36] <%BoboDaHobo> frank the tank??? from the dick show?
[1:02:37] <%BioApple> i checked out for a minute there and i've been staring at hat kid imagining all this ffxiv advice coming from her
[1:02:38] <%Buka_Zero> seen the death stranding trailer?
[1:02:40] <BunnyEmperor> Its the actual reason why I dont main Tank
[1:02:45] <%Faustgesicht> We going into Virgin Tank / Chad Healer territory?
[1:02:47] <%Typhaeon> Ramuh is cool though
[1:02:47] <$SGrim> @MasterDecoder you can look it up on youtube. It's fairly spoiler free, and outlines her virtue as a character. I recommend. \
[1:02:47] <%TDotGoat> a tank should generate infinite aggro at the start of the fight or else they're not really a tank
[1:02:47] <%Kataguro> Leviathan Leviathan

[1:03:41] <HollowMan190> that fact wasent fun
[1:03:48] <Keibutt> @StarMechV if you are having trouble crafting somethign for the Ixal, you might need to update your equipment, cause as far as I remember from doing those, they should be pretty easy to craft as long as you aren't in gear that's like 10+ levels too low
[1:03:50] <$SGrim> @MasterDecoder I could whisper the url if you'd like.
[1:03:55] <%MasterDecoder> Sure

[1:07:28] <@PeachSaliva> Hey @angriestpat why don’t you tell them how the vagina works?
[1:07:29] <%spinalwizard> just look at the numbers
[1:07:30] <Mr_Strut> How is food babby formed?
[1:07:30] <%tigerfang86> YES
[1:07:31] <$Kenzo2000> This coming from the man who recently learned to boil eggs
[1:07:32] <%Nikopol1717> Calories make the food go up
[1:07:34] <%tigerfang86> YES YES
[1:07:35] <BunnyEmperor> That's correct.
[1:07:37] <%ArcanumMBD> If they ship it to you why are you at the farm!?!?!
[1:07:38] <@PeachSaliva> Since you don’t seem to know how that works either
[1:07:38] <grayjammer> That's correct Pat
[1:07:38] <%CJett92> food become as poop
[1:07:39] <%tigerfang86> that's CORRECT
[1:07:40] <%duneblythe> it is just chemistry you eat
[1:07:41] <%Wynzler> They soak the vanilla bean in a can of marischino cherries and then they pour coke over it into a galss
[1:07:41] <+HotBloodedHero> animals or plants die, go into machine, then go to your mouth

[1:07:49] <+yoshkosh20> @AngriestPat so if I handed you a raw slab of meat and said it was food, you'd eat it right there?
[1:07:50] <%LtShuckle> apatDab

[1:20:04] <%MonsieurHedge> all i want to say is this world makes a lot more narrative sense is grooves wins the award
[1:20:04] <%LethargicRush> you think xander mobus had to practice his scottish accent or was he just naturally good at it?
[1:20:04] <%MasterDecoder> @ValidVenasaur a bird somehow
[1:20:07] <%tigerfang86> RECKLESS DETONATOR
[1:20:07] <StarkMaximum> One of my favorite tropes about games that highlight key items in speech is when they highlight whatever name the person uses to refer to it, like how "thingamajigs" got the color and icon for the Time Piece
[1:20:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wait JOKER is the voice of the conductor!
[1:20:09] <Supabait> owls PogChamp
[1:20:17] <+Estuko> @kiiiirsten 3rd option was my favorite.
[1:20:22] <agadejobi> So when does she put on the Mario hat?
[1:20:22] <%arcaderabbit48> @LethargicRush He actually did that accent once before
[1:20:22] <+skylerpilot> @yourliteraldog nah its mario 64
[1:20:24] <%kewlmyc> Game seems very cute
[1:20:27] <%BioApple> I give this movie... 61 Gemeralds out of 100
[1:20:29] <HealingMind> Reckless Detonator sounds like those names for TF2 classes every so often by unaware thread posters
[1:20:36] <%kiiiirsten> @Estuko LUL just throwin' ideas out there

[1:21:19] <$Kenzo2000> Ever played snake?
[1:21:20] <%kiiiirsten> @Estuko Nice! Definitely better than the Pokemon anime, enjoy!
[1:21:23] <%arcaderabbit48> @LethargicRush He voiced Daghda in SMT4: Apocalypse who had a very similiar accent, just deeper and raspier
[1:21:25] <A_Traitor> Hat kid looks like shes having so much fun
[1:21:38] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I want to have Hat Kid as an adopted daughter.
[1:21:39] <%tigerfang86> a video game exists!
[1:21:39] <$Kenzo2000> For real

[1:22:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm fine with that tho
[1:22:00] <%theAncopro> but neither can we
[1:22:01] <+Estuko> @kiiiirsten I intend to lol, actual goals reached + tentamon best lad.
[1:22:02] <+Arsimckhoi> what is this game? mario clone? i dont know what this is
[1:22:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> I love that dumb Kojima shit
[1:22:03] <Mr_pwng3> crowd surf!
[1:22:04] <WaxWitch> ohnKoji loves it
[1:22:04] <yourliteraldog> Wel thats kojima
[1:22:04] <%king_wragles> Kojima loves how much he hates war
[1:22:04] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat it's some weird alternate universe MGS
[1:22:04] <%tigerfang86> DIE HARDMAN
[1:22:05] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> I need it so shut it
[1:22:06] <%krispen_wa> and thats fine
[1:22:06] <PortableBoredom> Literally the first hint of gameplay we got. Looks like he stole the Fox Engine on his way out of Konami though, so that's good.
[1:22:07] <Floofiie> DIE HARDMAN
[1:22:07] <+trueoni> H O M O D E M O N S

[1:22:12] <Kingdom_65> @Arsimckhoi It's a 3D Platformer
[1:22:16] <IntrepidEye> Geopolitical shit plus weird magic shit
[1:22:16] <retro_pk> no, war is cool
[1:22:17] <%PlainSimpleTailor> And it never changes...except when it does
[1:22:17] <yourliteraldog> DEADMAN
[1:22:18] <$El_Desperad0> Gameplay looked underwhelming
[1:22:19] <+trueoni> what am i looking at
[1:22:19] <+Spec7re> Homo Demons is great
[1:22:20] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> HOMODEMONS
[1:22:23] <%supersmolman> But is that really bad
[1:22:23] <+Estuko> @PortableBoredom chances he left behind FOXDIE behind monkaS
[1:22:27] <+primax104> that game will be pure, unfiltered KOJIMA
[1:22:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> war is complicated, but delicious to consume via media.
[1:22:35] <dmtjinni> @MODS is Death Stranding bannad?
[1:22:36] <+MagickBurritoh> It'll pop out at the end
[1:22:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[1:22:38] <+Spec7re> Whats better than Demons? HOMODEMONS
[1:22:39] <%kiiiirsten> Outfit change PogChamp
[1:22:39] <%AllYouCanYeet> this mission is the biggest blemish on this game
[1:22:40] <thegreenbenis> @primax104 Movie*

[1:22:41] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> @primax104 o i wish
[1:22:42] <Kingdom_65> I want to play it because I just want to UNDERSTAND the game
[1:22:43] <Austin0097> I can't believe the plot is literally Norman Reedus making America great again.
[1:22:44] <FeelinNifty> foxdiehard-man

[1:24:17] <%GameInTheShade> GameInTheShade subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! did i miss the death stranding trailer reaction?
[1:24:20] <%kiiiirsten> This is one hell of a parade
[1:24:23] <+Zaramoth> too stumb for sticker
[1:24:25] <%ElenaManetta> Someone explaining why character customization in video games is so much fun to have when it adds zero mechanics to the game. Why are virtual clothes so desirable??
[1:24:27] <+superkeaton> Pat is once more blinded by piss, redbull, and Hat Kid's cuteness
[1:24:27] <%Frunkle24> this movie sucks
[1:24:29] <HealingMind> everyone talks about how bad this death wish is, but I never found it bad at all. The train Rush one, though...

[1:25:08] <CptBritches> Mardi Gras bands are VERY aggressive
[1:25:11] <OkamiDude15> @ElenaManetta sometimes people wanna be what they arent sfhMEH
[1:25:13] <%Dovahthing> @Mr_pwng3 YEAH FOR THE FIREMAN
[1:25:14] <%kiiiirsten> THE WINNER TAKES ALL
[1:25:17] <%kiiiirsten> it's the thrill of one more kill
[1:25:18] <pookam> yep
[1:25:20] <%tigerfang86> Yeah
[1:25:20] <%spiritofmojave> @elenamanetta my IRL fashion is garbo, so game fashion it is taggB
[1:25:21] <%superdude22> W E L C O M E
[1:25:22] <+superkeaton> Yes
[1:25:23] <pectusumbra> man remember that time dante lead a marching band?
[1:25:23] <%ECRead> yeah
[1:25:24] <a_mad_dragon> YES
[1:25:24] <Hydrapissed> yes
[1:25:25] <%supersugoisenpai1> Marching bands are brutal, they will trample anyone or anything in their path
[1:25:26] <+megaotter> exactly like this
[1:25:28] <%BioApple> that's hat kid's... eager face
[1:25:29] <%Dr00_PhD> @ElenaManetta you can make a thing look cute without the outside world judging it based on appearance
[1:25:31] <%skizzuto> can confirm, was a snare drummer for 8 years
[1:25:32] <LegendCobra> yeah if you slow down the people behind you kill you
[1:25:35] <HealingMind> @ElenaManetta I think the ability to customize a character to your liking further immerses you with the character or helps make the character more "yours"
[1:25:35] <%theAncopro> how can life be so stressful when you look this cute
[1:25:38] <+Spec7re> can confirm: have been run over before
[1:25:42] <+MagickBurritoh> AGH
[1:25:44] <Parapattern> Marching band kids are...something else
[1:25:47] <%Calliphor> nah, there's way more awkward adolescent attempts at banging in the back of the bus in real marching bands
[1:25:53] <pookam> i once tripped over my own shoe in marching band and lost half my health
[1:25:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @theAncopro sounds like an anime title
[1:25:57] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> get hearts Pat, you gonna need it
[1:26:00] <LokimenD> They're no different than a stampede really
[1:26:00] <%Dovahthing> I've had people FAINT while marching its nuts

[1:26:14] <+Spec7re> eat hearts hat kid
[1:26:21] <%NovaKnightmare> man this disney parade is pretty good
[1:26:24] <PortableBoredom> Now if only the camera were good
[1:26:27] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> super smooth
[1:26:31] <MultipleJiggs> I've never seen the finished version of this game in motion. It looks super smooth.
[1:26:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Sticker! Gotta get the sticker!
[1:26:34] <+Estuko> @Dovahthing it gets brutal, I remember doing a marching performance with a cut lip and my reed was just RED. NotLikeThis
[1:26:36] <%FrustratedAF> really like this mr. poppers penguins reboot
[1:26:40] <LegendCobra> yeah the movement isnt a mario copy but still nice and smooth in its own way
[1:26:42] <+Ryu_R> SourPls
[1:26:45] <OkamiDude15> your also on the moon so less gravity on this stage
[1:26:46] <derekwst3> if you like this game you would love Banjo Kazooie
[1:26:48] <%Ranryu692> I can't believe Pat is playing this, but shits on Banjo Kazooie
[1:26:51] <yourliteraldog> where are you leading this band
[1:26:52] <%tigerfang86> FIREWORK CANNONS
[1:26:56] <%Dr00_PhD> is this Antfish?
[1:26:57] <%Dovahthing> @Estuko I feel you, kindred spirit
[1:27:00] <%kiiiirsten> @Estuko I played clarinet in marching band in high school...

[1:27:15] <%tigerfang86> it's FINE
[1:27:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I wonder if Pat would give Banjo Kazooie a chance after this...
[1:27:18] <%Mornaka> was that a Tony Hawk sound?
[1:27:19] <+Spec7re> @Ranryu692 As much as i love banjo this game is way better than it
[1:27:19] <+agent_numa_lol> that's how parades work
[1:27:19] <%tigerfang86> ALL GOOD
[1:27:21] <pookam> one time at band camp
[1:27:22] <+SoarFlyer> because the show must go on Pat
[1:27:22] <+l3sovikk> Pat, my favorite part about this week's podcast was the talk about the French verb dictionaries.
[1:27:25] <%Nobrev> RUN BITCH RUN
[1:27:26] <+Estuko> @kiiiirsten bassclarinet because I wanted to impress girl I was crushing on, I'm 5'2 and barely reached 100lbs. lmfao.
[1:27:27] <+Deano8817> Parades are HARDVORE
[1:27:28] <JavaManJoJo> PogChamp
[1:27:28] <%skizzuto> to make the level harder
[1:27:29] <Saltmeisterr> EXPLODE THE CHILD\
[1:27:30] <%supersugoisenpai1> That's how marching band works
[1:27:30] <%Kataguro> Thread that needle
[1:27:30] <KirbonicAcid> Oh no I'm about to be murdered
[1:27:30] <Sulliman34> how did you not get hurt there

[1:27:33] <%kiiiirsten> @Zaphire_Saucypants OMG what a great idea I LOVE banjo kazooie
[1:27:37] <aimlesshealer> Parades are painful
[1:27:38] <yourliteraldog> it's for the kids
[1:27:38] <HealingMind> Pat moving like a Melee player over here
[1:27:39] <Mr_pwng3> is this what was happening back stage during the live letter
[1:27:39] <%kiiiirsten> @Estuko LUL suffering in the name of love
[1:27:40] <%depressed_skeleton> is this what disco is like?
[1:27:42] <rekinom> This is exactly what high school band was like, can confirm
[1:27:42] <%tigerfang86> IT'S FINE
[1:27:44] <$Bncbck> this BLOODSPORT of a parade
[1:27:45] <yourliteraldog> kids love bloodgames
[1:27:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @kiiiirsten as do I.
[1:27:53] <+Javaa01> Oh no, this is pleasant in comparison to the DMD version
[1:27:56] <%skizzuto> I like that the music evolves as you progress the level
[1:27:57] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> Parade of WAR
[1:27:58] <+skylerpilot> @Ranryu692 Hat in Time is like mario 64 not Banjo, also its really good. ( I like Banjo too but w/e)
[1:27:59] <+Estuko> @kiiiirsten my gay heart is good, but dumb af.
[1:28:02] <yourliteraldog> Jiust look at fornite
[1:28:06] <%kiiiirsten> Marching band is like this but with more sweating
[1:28:09] <%NovaKnightmare> is this what the roaring 20s were like
[1:28:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Oh, now I know why Pat loves this game. Girl in a tiny hat
[1:28:15] <pookam> cant help but to whistle along
[1:28:20] <%Dovahthing> Marching band and exhibition bands are as intense as they are fun

[1:28:49] <%Kataguro> I like the Conductor's movie more
[1:28:50] <%LethargicRush> i give that movie a 7/10

[1:29:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Looked like it was in the parade level.
[1:29:58] <+Estuko> @Dovahthing I suffered from heat super bad, so what I figured was cld wrappings kept in a cooler that I could wear when I got out there, probably invented something LUL

[1:55:41] <HealingMind> Wow, games today are so easy, you don't need to see what you're doing to do it. Kappa
[1:55:42] <+QuadraticGravity> @Sendrak70 well the good news for you is that with the data center interaction changes and the booming playerbase, pretty much every server is more or less packed.
[1:55:42] <+cyclone722> all the cool people playing on not lamia makes me a little sad
[1:55:50] <%ElenaManetta> I have never played a Final Fantasy game and I refuse to START NOW

[1:58:26] <$Ascethetic> Gilgamesh is cancer
[1:58:26] <%Frost_Quill> Crystal is full of ERP. Mateus is all about ERPing now too.
[1:58:26] <Zereaux> ANY tips for beginners ????????
[1:58:30] <%OlCaptainRed> they are ALL ERP servers
[1:58:30] <%gespenst25> You've never been there in your life have you?
[1:58:31] <%Ahack13> Balmung and Mateus got banished
[1:58:33] <%Shadowthedigger> Shadowthedigger subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Wow 9 months in a row subbed to a crazy red bull addict and almost a year total. Time for preparations for the 7th Umbral Edgelamity of Shadowbringers.

[1:58:40] <dukenux> Is it Goldshire Inn kind of RP?
[1:58:41] <yourliteraldog> It's an ERP severer?
[1:58:42] <%kiiiirsten> @luftraumm1 LUL
[1:58:42] <$SleepyMaribo> Balmung is the rp server, and its the fucking wirst...
[1:58:49] <$SleepyMaribo> *worst
[1:58:49] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Lamias are the really hot snake ladies iwth the tiddies
[1:58:50] <%AllyBeeBoo> whyy? i don't get it
[1:58:51] <@mothmandraws> I looked up all the server "identities"
[1:58:52] <InugamiTheHound> crystal=trap?
[1:58:53] <%aishman> Meanwhile I'm still in Balmung
[1:58:53] <OkamiDude15> oh christ goldshire
[1:58:53] <%spiritofmojave> it's that powerful
[1:58:54] <+Spec7re> Goldshire butt fuckery
[1:58:56] <$Kenzo2000> The desire to mock Balmung starts on install
[1:58:56] <%aishman> Cause my friends are there
[1:58:57] <Jakeofalco> why
[1:58:57] <%OlCaptainRed> I put on my robe and wizard hat
[1:59:00] <Don_Discovery> Balmung is the best server
[1:59:00] <%aishman> But it's so fucking bad you guys.
[1:59:01] <%mayorrev> who or what is balmung and what is this about ERP
[1:59:01] <rekinom> RP = bad apparently
[1:59:01] <Madbearv> I'm on levi
[1:59:01] <The_Bob_Guy> balamongrels get out
[1:59:03] <%Faustgesicht> is it like one of THOSE Rp servers?
[1:59:05] <ChoculaUltra> isn't that just like, making fun of the thing so you fit in kind of thing. Seems kind of hollow if he's only been playing for a week.
[1:59:05] <transporterthesequel> It is also comically overpopulated
[1:59:06] <Sulliman34> yall should go to behemoth its chill
[1:59:07] <StarMechV> So Balmung is the Badlands of FF14. Never to go there
[1:59:08] <+superkeaton> Balmung is just Goldshire with playable dragon girls
[1:59:08] <$Valdorick> Is Balmung the Moongaurd of FF14?
[1:59:10] <@mothmandraws> also gotta draw my character for youtube thumbnails now
[1:59:11] <%Typhaeon> It's really just a dumb meme more than anything
[1:59:17] <%Typhaeon> Easy red meat target
[1:59:18] <%docpepperphd> still on ultros?
[1:59:18] <Tucker0603> @rekinom no, erp bad
[1:59:19] <+QuadraticGravity> @Valdorick precisely
[1:59:19] <Koji104> not just erp but really just toxic as hell
[1:59:21] <Don_Discovery> Most of the people who erp on balmung come from the cross-world visitation
[1:59:22] <%blastazoid26> I got stuck in crystal and the stench of balmung reaches my world
[1:59:25] <+lucaflow> Balmung and Mateus are on Crystal
[1:59:26] <+Scevda> Whatcha expect, its FF, its not exactly known for its dimensional characters, any RP from that as a template is bound to be a magnitude worse.
[1:59:26] <RupanSen> isn't RP good in an... RPG?
[1:59:27] <$Ascethetic> balmung= moongarde
[1:59:28] <%spiritofmojave> Balmong doesn't belong in this worl
[1:59:29] <Mrchuckquizmo> I got yelled at by a person from Balmung in a Doman Mahjong lobby once
[1:59:31] <%Frost_Quill> My character is on Balmung because that's where the FC I wanted to join was on there.
[1:59:34] <%AdamElJefe> @AngriestPat So if I haven't played FF14 and prefer more solo play, I should go to Lamia si what you're saying
[1:59:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> They're laughing at your stumps pat
[1:59:38] <StarMechV> I still don't know how to visit other servers...
[1:59:39] <+Spec7re> KNEW IT
[1:59:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Oh. It's Moonglade.
[1:59:43] <+SoarFlyer> oh NO
[1:59:43] <OkamiDude15> @rekinom sometimes people take rp a bit too far
[1:59:44] <HeadsHeldHigh> E-RP more like it
[1:59:45] <$Valdorick> The kind prefaced with an E
[1:59:46] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[1:59:47] <@commanderclaw> Oh no, Virtual dick sucking
[1:59:48] <%JackMillerTime> oh
[1:59:48] <+cvp5127> oh
[1:59:53] <%kiiiirsten> There are MANY levels of Dork
[1:59:54] <Jetsfantasy> It's basically Goldshire in WoW
[1:59:54] <+MrWrann> Ya, get on moonguard
[1:59:54] <+Deano8817> aren't there fucking sex things on rp servers?
[1:59:55] <Floofiie> RP is for NERDDDDS (but it's fine)
[1:59:56] <%bread_assassin> Well, that explains it.
[1:59:57] <+Kurogane_Dread> BIG DORK
[1:59:57] <Dr_Mooose> there's a limit though
[1:59:59] <+MagickBurritoh> Turbo Mega Dork
[1:59:59] <yourliteraldog> Aw how cringey is it
[2:00:00] <hagly> Dork squared
[2:00:00] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@damienlunas) (warning)

[2:00:03] <Mr_pwng3> pat casts the first stone
[2:00:04] <%LupaTheWolf> Mega dorks
[2:00:04] <+cvp5127> suonds fun
[2:00:04] <Graywolf_the_45th> but you're playing an RP-g
[2:00:05] <StaticSunrise> rp is for creepy nerds
[2:00:05] <aimlesshealer> RPing in an MMO is just sad
[2:00:05] <%Golkin237> majinoWeebey1 majinoWeebey2
[2:00:06] <Smileyhat> Hey yo I'm one of those RP nerds on Balmung.
[2:00:06] <WaxWitch> Mega dork
[2:00:07] <Analogflame> RP people r weird
[2:00:07] <OkamiDude15> the creepy sex things
[2:00:07] <Daniel_Is_I> Er Moon Guard.
[2:00:08] <%spacehouse> ARRR PEEEE
[2:00:09] <pookam> oh ive been to GMod RP servers, i get you

[2:00:09] <ZM_Anon> SUPER DORK
[2:00:09] <Sulliman34> i aint gonna shit on people doing their thing in their server
[2:00:10] <damienlunas> Balmung is to go even futher BEYOND
[2:00:10] <+jorgamund> RP servers require a certain level of degeneracy. Plus you give up your soul
[2:00:10] <%aishman> This is all you need to know about Balmung: There are actual fucking whore houses
[2:00:11] <yourliteraldog> Tell us a story
[2:00:12] <+Darren716> But all of FF14 is role playing
[2:00:12] <%kiiiirsten> Goldshire is the best I luv2gank ballsy horde
[2:00:13] <+Javaa01> But how else will we get our high quality doorstop memes?
[2:00:14] <Don_Discovery> It isn't goldshire/moonguard for the inhabitants, it's the visitors from the cross-world that look for that shit
[2:00:15] <Kghaleon> You're a furry.
[2:00:15] <@mothmandraws> he must voice act in character
[2:00:16] <Supabait> RPing is extreme small dick energy
[2:00:16] <xmetalicdemonx> Its like those freaks in second life where they roleplay changing diapers and shit.
[2:00:17] <+Darren716> Why would this be different?
[2:00:17] <$Kenzo2000> Its like the LARPing of videogames
[2:00:17] <therakishsage> I'll be an ADVANCED DORK and I'll like it.
[2:00:19] <+miyoles> whats wrong with Rp servers?
[2:00:20] <a_mad_dragon> dork to the power of dork
[2:00:21] <%spiritofmojave> creepy Goldshire shit commence
[2:00:22] <+QuadraticGravity> RP is fine. The people I used to run into in Duties were the worst though.
[2:00:23] <%skizzuto> well it is an mmoRPg
[2:00:23] <HeadsHeldHigh> Balmung is full of glomping and blushing
[2:00:24] <%decent_gaming> No look pat, RP is fine, it's when you put an "E" in front of RP that it's a problem
[2:00:24] <mrgrimsmiles> so what criken dos
[2:00:25] <xAlcaidx> You didn't really 'say' anything
[2:00:25] <Tisaric> RP servers are the next level yeah
[2:00:26] <$bootysteve> Playing on an RP server means you're a dork and probably a sexual deviant
[2:00:28] <$cureneckbeard> playing on an rp server = "And this is to go even further beyond!"
[2:00:29] <$SleepyMaribo> Balmung is the reason the auto kick for being afk for to long exist...
[2:00:30] <+ssulcer> *nuzzles you* "OwO"
[2:00:30] <lilmac64> Imagine being such a number obsessed mook that you refuse to roleplay in your roleplaying videogame.
[2:00:30] <%PlainSimpleTailor> what is RP?
[2:00:31] <%Das_Bass> How does this server stuff work? I never played an MMO
[2:00:31] <InugamiTheHound> what if you want to do furry RP in a MMORPG like ff14?
[2:00:32] <+UberWolfman> I played on RP servers on WoW it was/not worth it
[2:00:32] <NeroInfinite> I forget what server I was on.
[2:00:34] <%ECRead> crikEdwad crikEdwad crikEdwad
[2:00:34] <Jetsfantasy> Good way to make Gil though Kappa
[2:00:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bootysteve or both
[2:00:37] <Twerknadooo> It sounds harmless enough at least. The bile I've heard about it made me think the place was like.. actively ruining the game.
[2:00:37] <+bobfriskit> anyone have advice for a newbie trying to grind?
[2:00:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> from the way you were talking i thought it was way worse
[2:00:43] <+Estuko> TwitchCop @ssulcer
[2:00:44] <StarMechV> I still don't know how to visit servers
[2:00:44] <Tisaric> it does feel very portal
[2:00:45] <rekinom> People bash on Balmung because it makes them feel better about themselves. "Hey I play a cat girl but at least I don't RP in my RPG"
[2:00:53] <+Spec7re> I remember playing on a WoW RP server when I was a baby, that sweet disgusting Goldshire orgy
[2:00:54] <shamblerhero> What happens if you don't RP in an RP Server
[2:00:54] <LegendCobra> it was
[2:00:56] <Luvinsus> It was in the Purple Time Rift
[2:00:56] <lilo52> @jetsfantasy buying gf
[2:01:03] <$Valdorick> Yeah, there's a busted up version of this stage as the time rift
[2:01:04] <Tisaric> it was in the time rift
[2:01:06] <rekinom> @shamblerhero Nothing
[2:01:08] <Don_Discovery> @shamblerhero nothing, people don't rp with you is what happens
[2:01:09] <@mothmandraws> ultros is just full of FC going "do you want to join my free company OWO XD rawr"
[2:01:14] <+Estuko> @lilo52 don't remind me of my Runescape sins.
[2:01:15] <%kiiiirsten> As a girl my interactions on MMO's are already iffy, I stay away from rp servers
[2:01:17] <Mr_pwng3> @shamblerhero reminds me of that guy in DnD just there for combat and edge rogue
[2:01:18] <%ArcanumMBD> @rekinom lol found the balmung player

[2:01:51] <%LethargicRush> what about door stopper?.
[2:01:53] <$shurtal> Is Table Cloth the Ralph Pootawn of FF 14?
[2:01:54] <%DXLelouch24> cucking Aymeric with my Miquote catgirl cause she a lesbian is the extent of my RPing and thats it
[2:01:54] <%AdamElJefe> AdamElJefe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:01:55] <+superkeaton> All potatoes are heroes
[2:01:57] <@mothmandraws> I assumed that FC is pats secret one
[2:02:00] <%aishman> Eh I've seen cool things in Balmung, like people cosplaying as HER
[2:02:00] <%Gespens> What about Door Wedge and Door Biggs?
[2:02:00] <+QuadraticGravity> Someone got super toxic at him and got banned super hard
[2:02:01] <+bobfriskit> Cool thanks all
[2:02:02] <+CanonHusbando> i really liked doorstop
[2:02:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its like that COH dude that had a scripted conversation when he put his character near a phonebooth
[2:02:03] <%aishman> And just silently stalking people
[2:02:04] <%vaporousTippler> ESO has Sleeps-on-Bridges. An Argonian who does exactly what you think.
[2:02:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Not as funny as Orokin Reactor
[2:02:05] <Saltmeisterr> jey wtf are lalafels anyway
[2:02:06] <DeeJayPonTres> Is balmung the only rp server?
[2:02:08] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat What about Door Wedge and Door Biggs
[2:02:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> not all heroes wear capes
[2:02:09] <$Valdorick> "They said I could RP as anything I wanted, I RP'd as a hero." - Table Cloth, maybe.
[2:02:10] <NeroInfinite> the rel trash are when you go into random raids and 90% of the the deathknight miqote dies because they are made of paper
[2:02:10] <InugamiTheHound> WTF that story is so weird
[2:02:13] <+Dead_trickster> what about the lalafel that rolepayed as a doorstop?
[2:02:14] <%PlainSimpleTailor> What if I played a character that deals mostly in poison and name myself CosmicYeastInfection
[2:02:16] <%ECRead> But what about Door Stop? Or Orokin Catalyst?
[2:02:21] <@mothmandraws> lalafels are like pat, he just wont accept it
[2:02:25] <Sulliman34> is pat's FC still the Storm Feelers

[2:02:33] <%skizzuto> Patato
[2:02:34] <%Mr_Initials> like halflings or harvin
[2:02:34] <%LethargicRush> short people are drawn to him
[2:02:35] <$Kenzo2000> The lalafel stood inside a door to keep it open. Was named doorstop
[2:02:36] <+Spec7re> lolifels more liek it
[2:02:36] <%LethargicRush> what can ya say
[2:02:37] <Smileyhat> @AdmiralButtloaf I legit laughed when I saw those two sitting there one day.
[2:02:37] <%kiiiirsten> The trade-off for facing constant harassment on mmo's is that there are boys willing to buy you expansions and game time without asking Kappa
[2:02:38] <rekinom> When is Pat going to admit he's a lalafel IRL?
[2:02:39] <Floofiie> What about Wi Fi with the title <Provider of the Realm>
[2:02:40] <Daniel_Is_I> Mustache Girl!

[2:33:22] <starotter70> Capture them and put them on her side of the bed as a suprise
[2:33:22] <OkamiDude15> you cant tell me spiders dont look super evil
[2:33:22] <%spiritofmojave> Spiders are friends!
[2:33:23] <Buzzard42> ghoops
[2:33:26] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Fart gas? No?
[2:33:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Reizie_Etherealm How did you know I was looking at ff14
[2:33:28] <%rosemon5001> dont kill the spiders if their not coming up to your face
[2:33:28] <xmetalicdemonx> Like anal leakage?
[2:33:29] <Belades1> Spiders are our friends
[2:33:31] <FlyguyJP> One spider too many
[2:33:31] <%ElenaManetta> One spider is capable of creating 1 million more spiders
[2:33:33] <VanLynx> evil killing evil does not make evil not evil
[2:33:39] <%CJett92> 8?
[2:33:39] <+QuadraticGravity> eight legs
[2:33:39] <pookam> uh
[2:33:40] <$cureneckbeard> Pat, no foolin', I saw a spider in my kitchen rush out and straight up ambush and murder a centipede.

[2:33:41] <+Estuko> @grayjammer only 4 Kappa
[2:33:41] <+MagickBurritoh> Four?
[2:33:42] <%LiquidBinge> "Spiders have four legs."
[2:33:42] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat In your sleep.
[2:33:42] <+Bob_Tom> and i got 2 hands and they can catch them both
[2:33:42] <demegodz> 8 legs
[2:33:43] <starotter70> huh
[2:33:43] <ChoculaUltra> its okay, the spider is bound to lay a big ol' egg sac soon.
[2:33:44] <$shurtal> four legs?
[2:33:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> 4...?
[2:33:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?

[2:33:44] <+TheoTTree> 4 pairs
[2:33:44] <Ragnakawaii> <3
[2:33:45] <Luvinsus> >four-legged spider
[2:33:47] <tungstenviper> THEY HAVE 8 LEGS
[2:33:47] <LegendCobra> they can fuck themselves 4 times
[2:33:48] <Archaveil> but also 8 slaps
[2:33:48] <ElementalX1000> 8 HUGS PogChamp

[2:33:52] <+TheoTTree> guys*
[2:33:52] <OkamiDude15> 4 legs sfhWOKE
[2:33:53] <%spiritofmojave> what happened to the other 4 D:
[2:33:53] <$Valdorick> Spiders are assholes, and my cat is proper to rip their legs off and then slowly impale them until they stop moving.
[2:33:54] <takiyami> i mean 2 hugs but okay
[2:33:54] <grayjammer> IVE BEEN DEFAMED
[2:33:55] <Mrchuckquizmo> Leg hugs sounds pretty lewd
[2:33:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @doc_ock_rokc I saw your bit donation about the materia thingy
[2:33:56] <+CanonHusbando> maybe more... imagine
[2:33:57] <crunkers_> but you need two arms for one hug
[2:33:57] <%JackMillerTime> poor crippled spider
[2:33:57] <+Estuko> Never change pat
[2:33:58] <%Sendrak70> no no no, its 4 legs and 4 arms. thats how they can give 4 hugs
[2:33:58] <NeroInfinite> Videogame spiders how ever ar ebigevil
[2:34:00] <Mr_Strut> The only good spider is a dead spider
[2:34:02] <%king_wragles> @grayjammer said 8, @AngriestPat accidentally a maths
[2:34:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 4 sets of eyes
[2:34:04] <pochecito> Prepare for a fucking banger Pat.
[2:34:05] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> the only good spider is a Spider-Man spider.
[2:34:05] <%Dovahthing> jumping spiders chase laser pointers like cats
[2:34:05] <cherpii> 4 pairs i believe equals 8 legs
[2:34:05] <Intolerable> ONLY 4 LEGS
[2:34:06] <@absolute_weapon> Probably meant four pairs of legs
[2:34:06] <%ElenaManetta> Who hugs people with one arm? That's weird, chat
[2:34:08] <%Faustgesicht> Cruelty happened
[2:34:09] <+masked_hero_lucky> Time to obliterate a toilet
[2:34:09] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat have you seen the "wacky wohoo pizza man adventures" video?
[2:34:10] <%Wynzler> @Reizie_Etherealm that was me lmao
[2:34:13] <televisedrevolting> Spiders are awesome y'all are just bitches
[2:34:16] <ValidVenasaur> I saw a black widow in my backyard the other day. Didn't kill it and don't know where it went. ;|

[2:34:19] <+CanonHusbando> get outa my swamp
[2:34:19] <thelonechris> Nah, that's in your seat
[2:34:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> WAS IT?
[2:34:19] <Louie_Salmon> @sendrak70 Do your hugs involve both legs and arms
[2:34:21] <%DXLelouch24> Spiders only belong in one place, in hell
[2:34:21] <+Reizie_Etherealm> NOOOO
[2:34:23] <%kiiiirsten> Anyway fuck spiders
[2:34:23] <+AFoolishPaper> THE EVIL JOHN
[2:34:26] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat's ultimate boss: The Outhouse!
[2:34:27] <SchroedingersFerret> All spoders are for hugs
[2:34:29] <+Estuko> @ElenaManetta one arm hugs is a sign of WEAKNESS, it's basically a level above hover hand tbh.
[2:34:30] <xmetalicdemonx> Wouldnt that be 2 hugs because one pair of arms equal one hug. Or is one arm around considered a hug?
[2:34:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> BIG BLIND SORRY
[2:34:30] <cherpii> Beetles are awesome. scorpions are awesome, spiders are literal SATAN
[2:34:31] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @elenamanetta To give dat Christian sidehug!
[2:34:32] <ElementalX1000> Mario World attack!
[2:34:34] <%CJett92> Look at those Super Mario World ghost house bubbles

[2:35:00] <%ElenaManetta> Does anyone remember those old Mario Tennis commercials where it was people in big Mario costumes and Bowser got mad he lost a match to some human so he re-routed a water fountain to a sewage pipe for the person to drink out of
[2:35:04] <%Typhaeon> ACTIVE TIME MANEUVER
[2:35:04] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You're saying this isn't FFXIV??
[2:35:08] <%spiritofmojave> learn the mechanics deeps, god

[2:35:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Stand in the fire like all DPS
[2:35:13] <%vaporousTippler> This is more or less the Ultima Weapon.
[2:35:14] <xmetalicdemonx> Are you telling me im gonna have to fight shit in ff14
[2:35:15] <%ElenaManetta> That commercial made me paranoid of water fountains as a child
[2:35:15] <+Estuko> reminds me of some enemy attacks from Honkai Impact 3rd
[2:35:16] <%arcaderabbit48> I unironically, completely seriously do in fact remember FF14's Poop Boss
[2:35:18] <Floofiie> DPS LOSS
[2:35:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> missed your chance there
[2:35:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> HEALER ADJUST
[2:35:21] <%Fidranth> it's like Jester from dmc3 a bit
[2:35:22] <RupanSen> aren't toilets hard counters to poop?
[2:35:28] <yourliteraldog> An episode of peppa pig was banned on the end game content zone know as australia because it was about how spiders (in theuk) aren't dangerous. In Australia all spiders want to kill you and stealyour spouse.
[2:35:28] <%spiritofmojave> TANKBUSTER INCOMING
[2:35:29] <%Wynzler> How do no bosses in FFXIV have a big arena wide shockwave attack that you have to jump over

[2:35:33] <+QuadraticGravity> Pat hit the boss when it's blue
[2:35:34] <Louie_Salmon> You're not DPSing hard enough, that's 50 DKP minus

[2:35:44] <$Valdorick> The uplifting music of poopboss
[2:35:47] <+Javaa01> Pat, bosses can be attacked normally when they glow blue
[2:35:48] <%Wynzler> there's spacebar
[2:35:52] <Floofiie> @DXLelouch24 There's a jump button?
[2:35:53] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> ...goddamnit, I forgot about FF14's poop boss.
[2:35:54] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat you can attack when it calls the cages by swining into it
[2:35:55] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Lucid dreaming is on cooldown! I can't reduce my enmity!

[3:12:50] <+ThatButler> The worst part about this game is how the badges clutter up your stylish hats
[3:12:54] <lilo52> this is more gravity rush than mario sunshine imo
[3:12:56] <%skizzuto> happy game makes for happy Pat

[3:24:59] <NoirePanzer> MTQCapture is real strong
[3:25:00] <IndoorSitup> At least he doesn't eat his own shit like my old cat used to.
[3:25:07] <%Cthulos> Cat owners swallow millions of their hair every night
[3:25:07] <+masked_hero_lucky> Jack-o' is best girl
[3:25:08] <$Valdorick> At least he eats strange things that are just gross, like his hair; he doesn't eat FUCKING PLASTIC LIKE MY RETARDED BABY.
[3:25:11] <%Cthulos> I know
[3:25:16] <%TheTakkster> Mr. Happy is pretty solid
[3:25:20] <@mothmandraws> ask pat the expert

[3:26:24] <+oOZtkOo> T.T
[3:26:25] <IndoorSitup> So is this new FFXIV expansion gonna make SCH boring?
[3:26:26] <quigley_plays> Have you tried the DoH/DoL absolute time sink in FF14?
[3:26:27] <%MasterDecoder> @mothmandraws lol
[3:26:31] <+trips___> i r the ast,whm
[3:26:33] <%Ninestempest> Scholar is easier after ShB so who cares
[3:26:36] <GhostPyre> uh
[3:26:39] <+masked_hero_lucky> Really? Scholar seems pretty easy to me
[3:26:40] <Warbot40> That's why I like support classes in general.
[3:26:43] <%spiritofmojave> :crab: SCH in ShB :crab:
[3:26:49] <%Ninestempest> Also 4.0 scholar is NOTHING compared to 3.0 sch
[3:26:56] <r_Foeburden87> Thats why im SCH heh
[3:26:58] <%Ninestempest> sb made it so simple
[3:26:59] <+oOZtkOo> pat they gutted my sch pat pls help
[3:27:02] <+ThatButler> So...
[3:27:03] <Calamity2007> @IndoorSitup Maybe but it is also going to make them more useful so you win some you lose some
[3:27:05] <+trips___> smn are pretty dang fun
[3:27:11] <$Valdorick> Pat's lying to you, play Blackmage Kappa
[3:27:11] <inz0mbiac> is there a massive different in FF 14 between PC and console?
[3:27:13] <Brainworm205> That’s me. Capped Scholar and Summoner.
[3:27:16] <%spiritofmojave> Glad I stuck with AST and WHM
[3:27:18] <luckevalentine> My brother has been leveling scholar and I don't think he knows that
[3:27:21] <Brainworm205> Mainly play Scholar though
[3:27:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Also as SMN/SCH you get to be a Jojo
[3:27:23] <%Ninestempest> @inz0mbiac only in that ps4 isn't as good performance wise
[3:27:25] <+Tarkara> My friend spent all day telling me how both other healing classes are gettign changed to just be reskinned white mages but i dont know enough ffxiv to know if thats true
[3:27:26] <%TheTakkster> @inz0mbiac Not really
[3:27:32] <IndoorSitup> I'm scared that they'll nerf SCH's DPS in Shadowbringers.

[3:28:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 28m.
[3:28:02] <%TheTakkster> they nerfed all non dps class dps
[3:28:04] <starotter70> Heart Surgery is Light
[3:28:04] <demegodz> They did the thing
[3:28:04] <%Ninestempest> Scholars DPS is actually GOOD, it's just BORING AS FUCK
[3:28:05] <+oOZtkOo> RIPPED IT ALL OUT
[3:28:12] <ASleepySnek> Hope you like 1 dot and 1 damage spell

[3:28:33] <Calamity2007> "DON'T FOCUS ON ANYTHING BUT HEALING" - Yoshi P on the Healer jobs
[3:28:33] <+trips___> healers are going to be more closer to pure healers i think
[3:28:35] <LegendCobra> heck yeah more jumps
[3:28:36] <%TheTakkster> Mothman
[3:28:36] <otakuloid02> i dont play ffxiv this sounds like rocket science to me
[3:28:38] <%TheTakkster> More moths
[3:28:39] <+UberWolfman> No pat reddit said its AWLFUL
[3:28:46] <+AnIcedCoffee> yeah but apparently people who play healer only want to dps while holding everyones lives in the palm of their hands
[3:28:50] <Brainworm205> Same, Pat. As a healer, I wanna heal big
[3:28:54] <%Ninestempest> also yall are wrong, white mages LITERALLY got a guage for DOING DPS
[3:28:55] <TheyCallMeVawn> Is FFXIV good for someone who doesnt really like MMOs?
[3:29:00] <Calamity2007> Shieldbreaker personally interests me
[3:29:05] <lilo52> @theycallmevawn no
[3:29:05] <Supabait> heal big number!!
[3:29:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> I got in
[3:29:09] <%Ninestempest> healers are supposed to dps, they just keep simplifying it for some idiotic reason
[3:29:12] <%Totally_not_toby> i remember that
[3:29:14] <Sulliman34> @Calamity2007 gunbreaker?
[3:29:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Is this one of those case where people are just going "MUH DPS"
[3:29:14] <%skizzuto> I tried it, bounced right off
[3:29:15] <+seoultrain> it wasn't because of you but I will allow you to believe that
[3:29:16] <%Fenlig> I didnt cos its dum
[3:29:17] <+trips___> i'm really glad healers are going back to healing focus
[3:29:18] <ekozu_3> hell yeah
[3:29:18] <NoirePanzer> I got into XIV and MonHun cause of you
[3:29:18] <%spiritofmojave> he's not wrong
[3:29:21] <%Cervantas> Pat sved Monster Hunter the same way he saved Warframe
[3:29:23] <Calamity2007> @Sulliman34 Derp, yeah
[3:29:23] <Aydarkzero> alright calm down Kappa
[3:29:25] <ape_hawk> guild wars 2 is cool, too
[3:29:25] <+masked_hero_lucky> I got into Monster Hunter because I was hoping to finally play a good one
[3:29:26] <%JackMillerTime> i remember it with yakuza
[3:29:28] <ape_hawk> okay, ill stop
[3:29:28] <%decent_gaming> @TheyCallMeVawn yeah it's good if you're not into mmos. I didn't care for them before XIV
[3:29:30] <%Mornaka> I got into MH because of Projared, oof
[3:29:37] <%Sendrak70> @AngriestPat Havnt been following the new expansion news. How many classes are they adding? They make dragoon a more reliable dps?
[3:29:39] <$Valdorick> You're not pushing your Alabama Liquid Snake on me after getting me hooked on crack, Pat.
[3:29:41] <%Totally_not_toby> morn i am so sorry
[3:29:44] <CurrySauseBandit> @BaronEgo It's more so that once you get to a certain point, you're standing around doing nothing for half the fight since damage is so low in the game. It happens a lot in many MMO's.
[3:29:45] <Supabait> the lotus? LUL
[3:29:50] <Buddha676> Can't play XIV when i'm playing BDO. :P
[3:29:54] <IndoorSitup> Oh yeah. DONT SPOIL IT GUYS

[3:30:12] <%Ninestempest> @Sendrak70 Dancer (ranged dps with lot of support), Gunbreaker (gunblade tank), drg was already good what tdo you mean
[3:30:18] <+masked_hero_lucky> Happy? Sure, wholesome? Eh...
[3:30:19] <$KnivesEve> wait, new story thingy in warframe?
[3:30:25] <DatAsuna> They weren't awful but they all become the joker game halfway through and get way worse

[3:57:31] <IndoorSitup> Don't go to the PUBG Bridge.
[3:57:33] <Twerknadooo> Pat, are you telling me that people have filters when people they need to respect are listening?
[3:57:34] <Ggamre> I saw Eric's mom and I cry, I scream and holler to god

[4:02:05] <IndoorSitup> Ni🅱🅱a~
[4:02:05] <frozenottsel> what do I search on youtube?
[4:02:06] <+RushUnplugged> kizuna just says FAKU
[4:02:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> They don't know pat
[4:02:09] <+masked_hero_lucky> I mean, they might not know what it means
[4:02:10] <+butch_deadlift> one of them sounded like they said it regularly. too comfortable
[4:02:11] <%ElenaManetta> but how are non-english speakers suppose to know! or am i missing something in the story
[4:02:11] <VanLynx> it's xbox live all over again
[4:02:11] <SecretAgentPickles> What do we search?
[4:02:12] <ssks123> apparently its translated in the subtitles as "naaa" so they just repeat it
[4:02:13] <@lewdskeletor13> Be careful chat
[4:02:13] <Kghaleon> Doesn't have much weight from japanese society
[4:02:14] <%LupaTheWolf> They don't know any better
[4:02:17] <+masked_hero_lucky> They probably just like the way it sounds
[4:02:19] <%Cthulos> FAKU YU
[4:02:20] <TheBlankAce> Its so fucked up that its all singsongy and cute too
[4:02:22] <%trnzero> japanese anime girls have the n-word pass
[4:02:22] <%willjar313> ...Okay. Devil's Advocate: They probably have NO IDEA what that word means.
[4:02:23] <+PenmanLupine> whats weird? Japan or Virtual Idols?
[4:02:24] <%supersmolman> But they dont know
[4:02:24] <%Cervantas> The word has no weight in Japanese society
[4:02:27] <$El_Desperad0> How can't they know?
[4:02:27] <+Alopekis> There's a good chance that they don't. lol
[4:02:28] <%Aeogard> they did it in a sing song voice, too
[4:02:30] <%Cervantas> you can't really blame them
[4:02:30] <televisedrevolting> MAYBE
[4:02:30] <Prism_Wing> This music + this topic = LUL
[4:02:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> It just sounds good to their ears
[4:02:30] <lilo52> damn the mods must be asleep
[4:02:33] <%Divryne> Fak u.
[4:02:33] <%bread_assassin> All anime girls have a free pass to say the n-word.
[4:02:34] <+GigaMechabee> I love me some ai girls
[4:02:36] <@mothmandraws> iirc its not translated to anything really in the text
[4:02:39] <%spiritofmojave> they probably just did it because of the sing songy delivery? I hope?
[4:02:40] <+cvp5127> nah
[4:02:40] <%Spec7re> fak u fak u fak u FAAAAAAK U
[4:02:41] <Madbearv> the one's who do don't care
[4:02:42] <McAngrimStein> They're clearly repeating it because it's done in a sing-song tone
[4:02:43] <+trueoni> @AngriestPat I was told it was because they like to repeat english phrases when heard
[4:02:44] <+PenmanLupine> oh Japan
[4:02:45] <@mothmandraws> I dont think the word translates well in the subs
[4:02:46] <LegendCobra> theres NO way none of them know
[4:02:48] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> but they don't care enough
[4:02:50] <Dio_TR> @ElenaManetta they know, they have to know, my country is less cultured than them and we know that
[4:02:50] <startstoprepeat> ai-chan got big for saying fuck so everyone else had to step up their game
[4:02:50] <%JackMillerTime> do they get a pass because of the internment camps?
[4:02:51] <%TheSniperJoe> They "sorta" get it but it isn't even remotely the same. Japanese racial slurs are weirdly structured and not even remotely the same as English.
[4:02:52] <LegendCobra> i think most dont give a shit
[4:02:52] <coke_monster> They know not to use the Hard R.
[4:02:55] <frozenottsel> Probably enough to know what it means, but not that it's bad to say
[4:02:56] <%iwishthiswasicq> I seriously don't think they know what that is.
[4:02:56] <+Alopekis> Found it. Just type "anime girl n word" lol
[4:02:58] <%QuadraticGravity> QuadraticGravity subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:03:01] <%Divryne> WOOLIE. LUL
[4:03:02] <%Keyd00d> It's like when kizuna started screaming FAK
[4:03:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> don't have enough stigma over there, I bet.
[4:03:05] <%spacehouse> Japan's full of xenophobes, not surprising
[4:03:05] <r_Foeburden87> WHY is it SO CUTE ?
[4:03:05] <+PenmanLupine> I think its like they know the word in that they hear it in music and movies, but don't understand its connotations
[4:03:05] <MrDonTacos_> dont worry all Vtubers have a n-word pass
[4:03:08] <%willjar313> To be fair, Asia has WAY fewer qualms about showing images of Hitler than Europe and America...
[4:03:16] <mrlastchance1> yo, do I get kicked out of the discord after my sub ends?
[4:03:22] <%Reizie_Etherealm> They get the N word pass with innocence and ignorance
[4:03:23] <@mothmandraws> cant arrest them they live on the internet
[4:03:23] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, a child could do without an arm
[4:03:24] <Surfinbear> ***

[4:03:35] <MrDonTacos_> LUL
[4:03:36] <%ElenaManetta> That's incentive to never sub again

[4:07:03] <Darthkitten_Prime> I mean, you picked the first mission
[4:07:07] <MrSparkle21> You are replaying a level
[4:07:07] <%SaltyDongs> sup
[4:07:10] <JinjaBredMan> lol
[4:07:11] <%willjar313> Man, I forgot Pat had a Discord. Don't even know where to find it...
[4:07:15] <%Reizie_Etherealm> WAASSAP
[4:07:17] <%Aeogard> reminder that Pat is a professional ff14 streamer
[4:07:21] <@lewdskeletor13> Yeah but anyone who’s subbed should definitely join the Discord, it’s a fun time as long as you’re chill and follow the rules
[4:07:21] <Louie_Salmon> Ah, darn, repeat cutscene
[4:07:22] <+JustSayAnything> I like him better with the hat.
[4:07:23] <GhostPyre> stop wasting time
[4:07:26] <frozenottsel> firefox
[4:07:43] <%Niney_Who> @willjar313 If you're a subscriber, you go into your Twitch COnnection options to get your Subscriber emotes on there, and it puts you in the Discord too
[4:07:56] <%Ninestempest> that's an amusing metaphor
[4:07:58] <%FrustratedAF> nuggets apatGib
[4:08:09] <+Alopekis> Careful. Sometimes you get one of those chicken nuggets and it has a bit more spice on it than the others.
[4:08:10] <@lewdskeletor13> That’s a good level of spice
[4:08:11] <GhostPyre> Think again
[4:08:14] <@commanderclaw> Be the kind of asshole that won't get you banned from twitch
[4:08:17] <%TheSniperJoe> wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle wander4Seapickle
[4:08:18] <Belades1> The ice shit's NOT here
[4:08:20] <Belades1> AT ALL
[4:08:23] <lilo52> it's very easy to not be racist
[4:08:23] <%TheSniperJoe> I'll do my best, Boss. :D
[4:08:25] <SecretAgentPickles> Wendy's spicy chicken nuggets are SeemsGood
[4:08:25] <%iwishthiswasicq> To be fair, if they're a really real asshole, I'd want them to out themselves anyway.
[4:08:26] <IndoorSitup> Can you turn off motion blur in the consicl versions of this game?
[4:08:27] <Belades1> The opposite side of the map
[4:08:29] <%ElenaManetta> In the freezer, PAT
[4:08:31] <TheButtravage> I'd say don't be a DSP level shithead, but even he still can succeed at streaming so....
[4:08:32] <+skm742> Honestly, put on sprint hat and run until you see something
[4:08:35] <McAngrimStein> upa ya butt
[4:08:35] <Belades1> @AngriestPat it's at the opposite side of the map
[4:08:37] <Louie_Salmon> I think the ice you're looking for is around the edge of the map
[4:08:38] <%Niney_Who> Bless this game for having Softlock PRevention like that
[4:08:41] <Darthkitten_Prime> I don't think it's actually in the ice area. It looked like glass.
[4:08:43] <ShichiNoBushi> In the bathroom. buh-dum-pish
[4:08:46] <@StridentSong> It's out in the far forest area
[4:08:48] <Acidshocker> No where near your
[4:08:50] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Get the moped!
[4:08:53] <@lewdskeletor13> Have you checked the freezer?
[4:08:59] <%ElenaManetta> This level's color palette is all over the place
[4:09:00] <%QuadraticGravity> @lewdskeletor13 can you help me find the discord connection

[4:09:33] <lilo52> @indoorsitup it doesn't have it
[4:09:35] <+Alopekis> @OkamiDude15 Aggressive compliments are the best.
[4:09:36] <+SoarFlyer> beep bep
[4:09:39] <Valask> So people were streaming full movies, porn, child porn, and recordings of school shootings en mass on the Artifact directory over the weekened
[4:09:43] <Prism_Wing> Scootypuff JR PogChamp
[4:09:45] <%Gogogolem> Wait does that child have a class d license?
[4:09:47] <%Propowers> I heard that Discord server is filled with nothing but weirdos
[4:09:52] <IndoorSitup> dang, motion blue hurts my eyes
[4:09:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Rootin' tootin' moped scootin'

[4:10:00] <Daniel_Is_I> Mask
[4:10:01] <%Aeogard> @Propowers yeah and we love it
[4:10:12] <%spiritofmojave> @valask Artifact is just Ustream for bigger weirdos sugoiLain
[4:10:12] <%iwishthiswasicq> That snap is my favorite.
[4:10:12] <Valask> and it took twitch multiple days to shut them down
[4:10:19] <@lewdskeletor13> This game is rad man. I love it
[4:10:24] <Darthkitten_Prime> It looks like the time rift is behind the starting area. It's not ice, it's some sort of glass.
[4:10:29] <Belades1> You keep turning right by where you need to go
[4:10:34] <@lewdskeletor13> These streams have sold me on getting this game
[4:10:36] <lilo52> it is ice
[4:10:49] <IndoorSitup> At least I got to re watch Avengers Endgame for free on Artifact.
[4:10:51] <+khalcipher> Is that the Dante color scheme?
[4:10:53] <%iwishthiswasicq> Did he do the finale yet?
[4:10:54] <ChoculaUltra> is this on the Switch?
[4:11:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Not yet.
[4:11:03] <CSNG> Are there even any more hats to make with yarn?
[4:11:03] <%FrustratedAF> not yet
[4:11:04] <@lewdskeletor13> @choculaultra It will be
[4:11:05] <+SoarFlyer> skillz
[4:11:06] <NoirePanzer> PogChamp pro A Hat in Time player
[4:11:09] <Valask> I watched episodes of Jojo
[4:11:10] <ChoculaUltra> eggcellent.
[4:11:11] <+BoomerTiro> Of course @AngriestPat Would play a game called "Hatin' Time"
[4:11:11] <%supersugoisenpai1> I'm playing FF7 and just got to climbing the Shinra building stairs where Tifa calls Barret a retard
[4:11:12] <+Alopekis> @Valask I feel like there's a point where you just shut down the entirety of the Artifact directory.
[4:11:14] <Valask> with 2k people
[4:11:22] <%willjar313> ...Yeah, still can't figure out how to get in pat's discord...
[4:11:26] <GemNinja> @AngriestPat what is your favorite kind of IRL hat?
[4:11:28] <+Alopekis> @Valask Usually before the CP starts popping up.
[4:11:35] <%willjar313> I am not the smart.
[4:11:38] <Dio_TR> @AngriestPat why don't you use the sprinting hat more often, it makes the game much easier to travel
[4:11:40] <+oOZtkOo> it froze time at the moment of impact
[4:11:40] <%Aeogard> anyway have fun chat i gotta go set up my new computer for HEATED GAMER MOMENTS
[4:11:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Quick attune to this aetheryte
[4:11:42] <%iwishthiswasicq> @willjar313 Are the emails for your Discord and Twitch the same?
[4:11:44] <lilo52> this rift is a fuck
[4:11:46] <Luvinsus> Time for comfy Purple Time Rift jorbsComfy
[4:11:47] <%FrustratedAF> first try
[4:11:51] <Torruun> Way to go Pat! That's how you use your stumps!
[4:11:52] <%Frost_Quill> Oh man time for DEEP LORE.
[4:11:55] <%willjar313> @iwishthiswasicq Yes.
[4:12:00] <%Spec7re> Got it
[4:12:00] <TabaxDM> no
[4:12:03] <Valask> @Alopekis twitch is afraid to act when it comes to movies because then they'd set a precedent
[4:12:03] <TundraOW> Is Pat baby?
[4:12:08] <%spiritofmojave> can you explain
[4:12:11] <%GabeSweetMan> So if Warframe satisfies Pat's Space Hats fetish, has this awakened Pat's lust for Time Hats?
[4:12:15] <NoirePanzer> Dino sprint hat best hat
[4:12:16] <Prism_Wing> @willjar313 You'll have to do it on a PC. Are you trying to do it on your phone?
[4:12:25] <Valask> @Alopekis it's a really weird system where the actual content owner has to claim the content
[4:12:25] <%Spec7re> Sleepy bois
[4:12:26] <@lewdskeletor13> @willjar313 Go to your Discord account. Add your Twitch account to it. Make sure both accounts have the same email. If you’re on mobile try using a desktop. It might take some time for the accounts to sync
[4:12:29] <+oOZtkOo> sleeby
[4:12:38] <a_mad_dragon> that looked liek a prerendered background until he moved
[4:12:46] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah 9, this is the BIG LORE one. Please don't skip it like you did the bird one.
[4:12:47] <Acidshocker> Be Sure to get Those Photos
[4:12:47] <+oOZtkOo> >:3
[4:12:48] <Valask> @Alopekis twitch is more or less hands off
[4:12:55] <%Spec7re> This is pretty
[4:12:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Ah yes
[4:12:59] <%skizzuto> this music is so chill
[4:13:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Calm destruction
[4:13:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Love scratches
[4:13:08] <%GabeSweetMan> This is my favorite of the lore dumps.
[4:13:09] <lilo52> its such a fuck
[4:13:10] <LegendCobra> this one isnt easy
[4:13:10] <Valask> this game makes me feel very nostalgic for platformers
[4:13:10] <+Alopekis> @Valask That doesn't make any sense when people are actively participating in illegal activities. You'd think they'd do it just to prevent legal issues on their end.
[4:13:15] <Dio_TR> BEST SONG IN THE GAME
[4:13:21] <pectusumbra> there's something behind where you spawned
[4:13:26] <Dio_TR> LORE
[4:13:29] <SecretAgentPickles> I really wish there were an indicator for when you clear a level of photos. Took me forever to do these out of fear of progressing without a photo.
[4:13:38] <Valask> @Alopekis yeah they started doing stuff when the illegal shit started popping up
[4:13:39] <%Spec7re> I looove this OST
[4:13:40] <%tortugatime214> tortugatime214 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[4:13:56] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Very squeaky
[4:13:57] <%ElenaManetta> This music is aggressively relaxing
[4:13:57] <%spiritofmojave> sugoiSchleep
[4:14:01] <%Niney_Who> One in that room you started in
[4:14:03] <Acidshocker> There is one in the house
[4:14:03] <Valask> I saw some hentai on there
[4:14:05] <Valask> it was wild
[4:14:05] <%willjar313> Glad to see old-school collect-a-thon platformers are still alive and well.
[4:14:08] <%scrumdrew> theres another page
[4:14:26] <LegendCobra> you missed a thing
[4:14:31] <fairore> @elenamanetta aggressively lol
[4:14:32] <Valask> "if Artifact gets shut down, we'll just go to Anthem"
[4:14:35] <%Propowers> this elevator music tho
[4:14:35] <%Faustgesicht> Fengully?
[4:14:35] <lilo52> @willjar313 they're not. this game is the exception, not the rule
[4:14:39] <+Alopekis> @Valask Really weird decision for them to wait while full movies are being streamed.
[4:14:42] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah fit that square peg in the round hole Pat.
[4:14:42] <GemNinja> hope hat in time gets another update to finish the story
[4:14:53] <Valask> @Alopekis endgame was on there for a while too LUL
[4:14:54] <%Niney_Who> LUL

[4:15:04] <xeros720> wrekt
[4:15:10] <%LtShuckle> this is the hardest purple rift I think
[4:15:11] <+Alopekis> @Valask Oh wow. lol Was it at least good quality? Or was it cam quality?
[4:15:25] <+PenmanLupine> that squeak toy sound always makes me stupid happy
[4:15:27] <%GabeSweetMan> This is the best one too.
[4:15:28] <pectusumbra> So I guess we can say this stream is B A L L E R
[4:15:38] <Valask> @Alopekis it was small screen cap to avoid automatic content ID
[4:15:38] <Louie_Salmon> @gemninja The Roomba backstory felt like a tease for a Hatkid rift, since it opens on a picture of her
[4:15:46] <@lewdskeletor13> This game is a big chill game
[4:15:53] <%FrustratedAF> yew lot peckin in here?
[4:15:53] <%GabeSweetMan> @Louie_Salmon I got baited hard by that.
[4:15:54] <%TheTakkster> I love this music
[4:15:54] <Valask> this main character is so smug how can you resist plunging them into the lava
[4:15:55] <+Alopekis> @Valask Aaah. Well, better than nothing I guess. lol
[4:15:59] <%willjar313> @lilo52 Why must you be the screen door on my submarine?
[4:16:12] <+Alopekis> @Valask She's smug but it's a cute smug, so it's okay.
[4:16:23] <@lewdskeletor13> Hat Kid is great
[4:16:33] <+GigaMechabee> bless hat kid
[4:16:33] <Louie_Salmon> How can this be
[4:16:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The risk he took was calclated, but boy he was bad at math
[4:16:43] <+Alopekis> lol
[4:16:46] <TheWashoutXY> Hat kid is the cutest game mascot
[4:16:46] <Dr_Mooose> nice

[4:17:21] <pectusumbra> I'm surprised color swaps don't change the umbrella
[4:17:24] <GemNinja> @TheWashoutXY Hat Kid is the smuggest video game mascot
[4:17:29] <fairore> @thewashoutxy Pikachu?
[4:17:36] <Prism_Wing> This feels so much like Spyro.
[4:17:38] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL

[4:17:44] <$RaikenTB> wtf was your plan?

[4:17:47] <+oOZtkOo> WHERE WOULD IT SWING
[4:17:47] <+Alopekis> Yeah. I'll agree with Hat Kid being the cutest game mascot when Pikachu stops existing.

[4:19:52] <fairore> so why is chat saying this mute character is smug?
[4:19:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> "Can I make it?" - Paige right before she didn't make it
[4:19:57] <indig0bird> "toor" would be more like "tur"
[4:20:06] <+Alopekis> You should apologize to everyone who has ever watched your streams, Pat.
[4:20:08] <@lewdskeletor13> @fairore She’s super smug
[4:20:08] <fairore> never played this game
[4:20:09] <%Spec7re> Do your thing man

[4:20:21] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Never be sorry
[4:20:21] <%NWR_James> I don't mind it but there are times where it's more like "I hope Pat's gonna be okay"
[4:20:21] <a_mad_dragon> apologize to the podcast listeners too SoonerLater
[4:20:23] <%tigerfang86> Get OUT of fighting games
[4:20:23] <Dr_Mooose> We understand the addiction
[4:20:24] <+temporal_zenith> @AngriestPat It is nice to see someone passionate about what they like
[4:20:25] <OkamiDude15> @fairore she does a dance and it has a sfhSMUG cat face which people dub as smug
[4:20:28] <%SirGO0SE> I'm one of those and I don't hold anything against you at all. I love ya and wouldn't want to change you so we put up with it happily :)

[4:20:31] <thetruenicster> besides, im a little interested
[4:20:31] <ape_hawk> apologize for existing!!!!
[4:20:34] <GemNinja> what are the odds to winning in that FFXIV casino lottery
[4:20:34] <%GabeSweetMan> @AngriestPat I'm actually talking my brother into starting FFXIV with me because of how hype you are about it.
[4:20:34] <%laserbeaming> I don't care about XIV, but I like you enthusiasm
[4:20:35] <+Alopekis> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[4:20:37] <HollowMan190> gonna be honest.....I really don't care
[4:20:38] <%luftraumm1> I finally got to ishgard and am beginning DK
[4:20:38] <@lewdskeletor13> We’re here to watch you Pat! The games are incidental
[4:20:38] <%spiritofmojave> You should just apologize to Woolie for making him die every podcast, I love 14 personally
[4:20:40] <corepool> fucking savage
[4:20:40] <%afronooch> we DEMAND STREAMER APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING A GOOD TIME
[4:20:42] <+SoarFlyer> PogChamp Progress
[4:20:42] <%iwishthiswasicq> In fact, give me all my money back.
[4:20:42] <%NWR_James> raw but not wrong
[4:20:42] <$SleepyMaribo> Fuck off, FFXIV is awesome, everyone hating never even played it
[4:20:42] <%Spec7re> Burned to cinders!
[4:20:43] <%Frost_Quill> You got me into it and now I have a DPS and a Healer over lvl 50 and I'm lvling a tank now.
[4:20:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> woof
[4:20:45] <Twerknadooo> If you go to a streamer's stream and it offends you to hear what they like, you should prob go to a diff stream tbh
[4:20:58] <%ElenaManetta> When is Pat going to have stream blocks like professional Woolie. Getting into MMOs
[4:21:02] <+SoarFlyer> can i have a refund on my free prime subs
[4:21:04] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[4:21:05] <fairore> thanks chat for info
[4:21:08] <Shastafield> LUL
[4:21:10] <Dio_TR> PAT you missed one
[4:21:11] <majindusto> Did Pat talk about Death Stranding?
[4:21:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah woolie fucking dies
[4:21:12] <TundraOW> The biggest thing holding me back from playing MMOs is the time sink. MMOs really aren't my genre
[4:21:15] <HollowMan190> I can hear him glaze
[4:21:15] <frozenottsel> pugilist
[4:21:16] <@StridentSong> Glaze nothing man, he goes into a hibernation coma
[4:21:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The only thing you should apologize for is the fact that you keep postponing the streams I look forward to
[4:21:19] <+Alopekis> I demand you refund my free subscriptions!
[4:21:20] <@lewdskeletor13> He almost fell asleep last podcast
[4:21:21] <%Faustgesicht> well, that's his deal
[4:21:21] <+oOZtkOo> you can see woolies soul leave him
[4:21:21] <%SirGO0SE> it's rough. it makes me realize what it was like when i would ramble about WoW to people who didnt care. good perspective
[4:21:22] <SpaceGuntank> yeah i dont really care for XIV at all, but i dont care because pat is charasmatic as fuck
[4:21:22] <HollowMan190> it's pretty funny
[4:21:22] <%willjar313> Pretty sure if you demanded Woolie to stop talking about fighting games, he'd kick the shit out of you.
[4:21:24] <%LtShuckle> oh god this room
[4:21:25] <LegendCobra> just say "its like fighting games"
[4:21:25] <+BoomerTiro> If woolie can;t see the tech in FF14 he is the one missing the fighting game eye
[4:21:26] <+Alopekis> And give them to Paige!
[4:21:27] <Dr_Mooose> oh no
[4:21:27] <%NWR_James> BIG MISS
[4:21:29] <%Propowers> Just say its like blade and soul Kappa

[4:21:39] <%Frost_Quill> Stop rushing Pat it's only going to make it worse.
[4:21:39] <Graywolf_the_45th> YOU FUCKED UP
[4:21:40] <+SoarFlyer> I can't believe Pat just ruined my life
[4:21:40] <Darthkitten_Prime> I hate MMO gameplay, I just can't enjoy the way it plays.
[4:21:41] <%Niney_Who> You didn't miss a Page I don't think
[4:21:41] <%NWR_James> You will never finish the game now
[4:21:43] <%spiritofmojave> apatGoblin
[4:21:43] <LegendCobra> youll find out in the end
[4:21:44] <@lewdskeletor13> You tried to get him excited about the stands and he was literally on his phone @angriestpat
[4:21:49] <GemNinja> @AngriestPat so when you talk about FFXIV its like when Mike talks about Star Trek with Jay?
[4:21:51] <%Frost_Quill> He might be fine but he didn't KNOW that when he jumped.
[4:21:51] <TyrantBelial> People are being asshokles it's fine.
[4:21:51] <%trips___> yeah, i been in this stuff since ffxi came out in 2001 or 2002. But people who don't like it, really don't like it.

[4:22:17] <%Spec7re> I dont mind it means i get to listen to more of this music
[4:22:19] <Kghaleon> I might be wrong, but isn't there a hidden platform?
[4:22:21] <%LtShuckle> you are fine
[4:22:24] <%spiritofmojave> *shites
[4:22:25] <Daniel_Is_I> You're good

[4:22:48] <%MasterDecoder> You should be fine at
[4:22:53] <%MasterDecoder> *Pat
[4:22:55] <%willjar313> Guy, shh. Let the Mind Goblins do their thing.

[4:23:03] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> not today raccoon!
[4:23:03] <Daniel_Is_I> SHOCKWAVES
[4:23:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> What analogy?
[4:23:07] <LegendCobra> HORY SHIT
[4:23:15] <@StridentSong> The analogy was that it was more like you get to play Street Fighter, but you only start with light punch. Play 10 games, you now get medium punch. Play 25 more, Heavy Punch. The hitting him in a head with a rock to make him forget how the games work wasn't quite the same
[4:23:17] <Kghaleon> Yeah, this was where that hidden platform was.
[4:23:18] <GoYaK> Did he finished the Plague Tale ?
[4:23:24] <$SleepyMaribo> its below you

[4:26:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> He turns black and yellow
[4:26:09] <%krispen_wa> when he was imprisoned he was turning into him
[4:26:09] <Darthkitten_Prime> Because he was shadowy and had yellow eyes?

[4:26:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> his coloration and eyes
[4:26:15] <+SoarFlyer> you could tell by the way that is was
[4:26:15] <%Dkun4> When he was locked up
[4:26:15] <%Frost_Quill> He looked like the Snatcher when he was hanging.
[4:26:16] <%laserbeaming> It was literally the Snatcher's Purple and Yellow Face
[4:26:16] <+temporal_zenith> @demegodz Also, one of his letters comments on the prince studying law, hence all of his contracts!
[4:26:17] <TheyCallMeVawn> Pat pls
[4:26:18] <%GabeSweetMan> It's not clear cut. It's IMPLIED at best.

[4:40:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> You know hat kid could be a tenno and it wouldn't change a thing
[4:40:34] <Tisaric> He's probably around 80% done with base game
[4:40:36] <%GabeSweetMan> This is not a long game.
[4:40:38] <+chrishnaw> Gotta get high
[4:40:38] <+SoarFlyer> @turretgunz hats%
