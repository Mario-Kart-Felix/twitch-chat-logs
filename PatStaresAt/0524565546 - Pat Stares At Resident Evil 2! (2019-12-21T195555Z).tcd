[0:02:14] <%KaiserMario> apatCanada
[0:02:16] <YaiGameworks> @cant_pick_a_name Probably play some other games, but yes Pat is aiming to play all the mainline RE games.
[0:02:18] <derekwst3> @cant_pick_a_name he said he is going to try to beat all the main games
[0:02:23] <xanderfist> RE2 HYPE
[0:02:26] <%kiiiirsten> fuck you for streaming when I still have 2 hours of work left!!!!!
[0:02:27] <%PopulousNix> something good to do the laundry too
[0:02:27] <cant_pick_a_name> ah
[0:02:28] <%StaceMcGate> Also Witcher is good, but the pacing is atrocious for first few episodes. 3 different stories taking centuries apart
[0:02:29] <@SSaryn> apatDab sipsipDab fugginDab
[0:02:36] <CaptainKayla3917> re2 classic or remake?
[0:02:38] <%Ascethetic> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:02:41] <suikudo> Pat already fucked this whole thing up by not playing 0
[0:02:46] <%deviljhojho_> What even is the meaning of resident evil
[0:02:49] <suikudo> Everyone knows 0 is before 1
[0:02:50] <bleugh> nyannDab
[0:02:51] <%PopulousNix> @captainkayla3917 classic rn
[0:02:51] <goddomove> has he platinumed it?
[0:02:58] <%CygnusRoboticus> he's doing release order
[0:02:59] <YaiGameworks> He plans to play Zero, I think he's going in release order, not chronological order.
[0:03:06] <derekwst3> glad witcher is decent, going to have to watch that too
[0:03:08] <suikudo> Dam
[0:03:09] <+FrostyAri> release order my guy
[0:03:15] <EliGrumble> i never liked 0
[0:03:28] <warmnoid> 0 is too tedious for me
[0:03:29] <bleugh> how's superman as geralt
[0:03:38] <derekwst3> he should be done with 2 in no time
[0:03:41] <%Antoids> how many re2 playthroughs does this make?
[0:03:42] <CaptainKayla3917> 0 once past the train gets better but still has major issues.
[0:03:43] <xanderfist> 0 is pretty challenging
[0:03:43] <+FrostyAri> Any excuse for more Rebecca is good in my book
[0:03:48] <+PenmanLupine> From what I've seen, Henry Cavil's doing a good job.
[0:03:49] <suikudo> ^
[0:03:58] <shandytowne> 0 is pretty tho.
[0:03:58] <YaiGameworks> The games he said he planned to play: One route of RE1 (done), A/B scenarios in RE2 (progress), RE3, Code Veronica X, REmake, RE0, RE4 (Seperate Ways included), RE5 (DLC included), RE6 Revelations 1, Revelations 2, RE7 (DLC included), REmake 2.
[0:03:58] <suikudo> Rebecca is a better character than Leon
[0:03:59] <%StaceMcGate> Henry Cavil is best part of the show. They didn't even put a red wig on the actress who plays Tris hair
[0:04:04] <%KaiserMario> Will this be a full LP, or just one side A/B campaign?
[0:04:04] <%CygnusRoboticus> Pat's inspired me to replay REmake and man it's rough
[0:04:08] <derekwst3> zero was the first resident evil I played
[0:04:10] <%AnIrishPapaya> AnIrishPapaya subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Did you ever play The Forest? The 2nd one's trailer released, and it looks like it's going to be hot sequel garbage.
[0:04:14] <leinadtonu> How was Pat's morning stream? Any heated gamer moments?
[0:04:16] <residentfunko> @deviljhojho_ as a kid it's that next door neighbor friend who stays in your house too long and is pissing you off that you inevitably have to get your parents in order for him to leave the house
[0:04:18] <hassanico2> Didn't they fuck up Triss and Yennifer really bad?
[0:04:18] <%deviljhojho_> its a good thing Cavil was so into the games
[0:04:25] <%CygnusRoboticus> I think RE2R might have invalidate all the old games
[0:04:29] <ricotez> patstream :o
[0:04:38] <%deviljhojho_> @residentfunko That kid grew up to become That Guy
[0:04:39] <%StaceMcGate> Yennifer is fine, Triss is played by an African American Actress which threw me off
[0:04:41] <goddomove> wait he's not going to play the remake now?
[0:04:47] <residentfunko> exatly

[0:04:57] <YaiGameworks> I think he's going in release order, so REmake comes after Code Veronica.
[0:05:02] <%Gurren10101> Gurren10101 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[0:05:07] <hassanico2> When's UMBRELLA CHRONICLES PAT
[0:05:10] <YaiGameworks> And he'll only play one route in REmake like how he played one route in RE1.
[0:05:11] <hassanico2> You gigacoward
[0:05:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> SCREAM AT ZOMBIES LIKE bokoenOoo_RD
[0:05:14] <%grimm_hatter> I wonder how long re3 will be
[0:05:17] <goddomove> @hassanico2 yeah ok
[0:05:21] <rytisone> still the wrong game in the category
[0:05:24] <%CygnusRoboticus> Oh man UC would be awful
[0:05:25] <%Vyskus> apatDab_HF apatDab apatDab_HF apatDab
[0:05:28] <CaptainKayla3917> code Veronica is the only classic I haven't finished. is it worth it?
[0:05:33] <hassanico2> Umbrella and Darkside are super cannon you cannot deny that fact
[0:05:36] <SilverFaustX> no
[0:05:37] <YaiGameworks> He said he wouldn't do most of the spin-offs like survivor, dead aim, Chronicles games, Gaiden, etc., but would be doing the two Revelations titles.
[0:05:38] <%StaceMcGate> Also Dandelion goes by his original name Jaskier
[0:05:43] <%the_mental_punk> @CaptainKayla3917 yes
[0:05:44] <derekwst3> soon ill have all the emotes from channel points
[0:05:52] <residentfunko> also i just finished Witcher it's a slow start but it really kicks off strong and finishes you off wanting a 2nd helping which were getting cause production starts in February :)
[0:05:56] <%blondie_ow> I can't wait for Pat to speedrun Leon B with no damage and no saves.
[0:05:57] <%deviljhojho_> The books sure were different from the games
[0:05:57] <hassanico2> @derekwst3 don't those only last a day?
[0:05:58] <rideroftraps1> apatSleep
[0:05:58] <cant_pick_a_name> Code Veronica is crazy
[0:06:05] <%CygnusRoboticus> Cyber Mr. Xes are canon I can't deny it

[0:06:08] <SoySocks> good afternoon pat and chat
[0:06:11] <%honeyman18> @derekwst3 don't those only last 24 hours?
[0:06:13] <%dekkitout> @derekwst3 Dear god, he's assembling the channel points infinity gauntlet
[0:06:16] <hassanico2> Code Veronica goes maximum stupid in the best way
[0:06:18] <%deviljhojho_> im glad Cavil is finally allowed to release his inner nerd
[0:06:22] <%deviljhojho_> he is a mighty gerald
[0:06:26] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat i guess they do
[0:06:35] <hassanico2> But probably not the best for gameplay
[0:06:41] <CaptainKayla3917> Guess it's time to bust out the dreamcast then
[0:06:41] <xanderfist> but what if the zombies scream back?
[0:06:47] <%StaceMcGate> Each episode of Witcher is based on the books... so it's hella nerdy
[0:06:47] <derekwst3> that makes me want to !raffle
[0:07:00] <%deviljhojho_> !raffle
[0:07:03] <hassanico2> Also Darkside has a legit better Code Veronica I feel. Even in light gun game form.
[0:07:03] <EliGrumble> no hit run lesgo
[0:07:05] <%KaiserMario> It's a shame Pat will never play Dead Aim, that game has some dumb shit
[0:07:09] <+veraverse> !raffle

Also, don't Elden Ring and Bayo 3 look incredible?

[0:32:11] <kiefmeister123> beat Sherry with a stick
[0:32:12] <narusao> aand how she's deaf in one ear
[0:32:13] <+Darren716> Like 5, 6 , rev 2
[0:32:13] <%AncelDeLambert> just pick her up and carry her, at this point
[0:32:13] <spoonbruh> Worse companion than Ashley haha
[0:32:15] <Dragon_Batman> I can't imagine Paige joingin in 5
[0:32:16] <rytisone> kick zombies head right in from of the child
[0:32:20] <JetpackMcQuack> That would be great
[0:32:21] <godzookylives> RE5 with Paige LUL
[0:32:21] <vascillia> @AngriestPat what do you think of this game's music vs remake's? I think remake dropped the ball there
[0:32:26] <%IncendiaryStupidity> Pat you gotta be nice to Sherry she's cowering for two now
[0:32:30] <Spawntaneous501> RE6 with paige
[0:32:31] <tigerfang86> RE5 with paige....
[0:32:33] <Dragon_Batman> Hell RE Rev 2 stopped
[0:32:33] <+sockafock> firing your gun right next to the child’s ear
[0:32:34] <Fujiwara_92> SPARKSHOT THO
[0:32:36] <hassanico2> Classic Music is way better
[0:32:42] <hassanico2> RE2 Remake music's too subdued
[0:32:42] <Serge_12> Do Re5 with Paige!
[0:32:42] <%Tenebrae94> Tenebrae94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[0:32:44] <AutechreTwinAphex> why dont the zombies attack sherry?
[0:32:46] <Gruntini> If you COOP 5 or 6 with paige, we'll never make it to 7
[0:32:46] <+ConLin_Arts_> RE5 with Paige would be super fun!
[0:32:53] <+ConLin_Arts_> good!
[0:32:57] <Dragon_Batman> It does need to happen
[0:32:57] <cant_pick_a_name> damn I don't even really remember remake's music lol
[0:32:57] <$draugrix> Sherri would play Apex legands and you know it
[0:32:59] <+ilikegamestime> re5 is the one where you have to save africa right?
[0:33:01] <%Teintstein> she loves it
[0:33:01] <uncledoodsauce> we all know paige is the one playing. pat's just using a broken controller. also DSP is their house cleaner. Kappa
[0:33:01] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kappa
[0:33:03] <%blondie_ow> Lol at Sherry just staring at you
[0:33:05] <tripfiendWK9> is that zambambo wearing an Adam and The Ants shirt?
[0:33:06] <DracaenaLeaf> Wasn't Paige not good at aim controls?
[0:33:10] <Dragon_Batman> Yea @ilikegamestime
[0:33:11] <Ner234> "Yes, puke on the child." - Pat, 2019
[0:33:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> GREAT
[0:33:19] <MikeNized> The music in Remake isn't memorable because there is a different focus now : graphics and ambiance over ambients.
[0:33:20] <+thenoodle007> Puke in the child's purse
[0:33:20] <hassanico2> @draugrix RE6 Sherry looks like a streamer
[0:33:21] <%Jekado> sherry is tank role
[0:33:23] <spoonbruh> They won’t attack her because she’s infected
[0:33:23] <+EmotionalFatGuy> children are like 90% puke anyways
[0:33:24] <%deviljhojho_> girls HATE being puked on
[0:33:26] <+Shadowpint> Just play on Easy for Paige
[0:33:26] <GoogleyGareth> LUL
[0:33:29] <%Jekado> Sherry tank top
[0:33:29] <%deviljhojho_> most of em anyways
[0:33:29] <%honeyman18> The next level
[0:33:31] <%blondie_ow> Pat's going to be an awful parent
[0:33:34] <GoogleyGareth> woolieMIRIN
[0:33:34] <%Teintstein> hahaha sherry
[0:33:35] <%AliceAstro> stop smelling the gun child
[0:33:35] <%starotter70> Hey Sherry
[0:33:37] <%Jekado> sherry
[0:33:37] <tigerfang86> We'll just go and replace everythingo n the child
[0:33:38] <%SoFarFetched> Better to puke on the child than to puke in your girlfriend's purse
[0:33:40] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[0:33:41] <%dekkitout> Have the child feed
[0:33:41] <Ner234> aaaaaaa
[0:33:44] <+saltytyrz> Father of the decade
[0:33:45] <%deviljhojho_> oh no oh no no no
[0:33:49] <%starotter70> By Crouching
[0:33:51] <rytisone> someday these clips will come back to haunt you
[0:33:53] <%AliceAstro> unevolved
[0:33:55] <+Darren716> Man i cant believe punchmom agreed with woolie on the puke thing
[0:33:56] <%Bailey__gaming> Aaaaaaaaaa
[0:33:56] <spoonbruh> They mostly puke at night....... mostly
[0:33:57] <Fujiwara_92> Woolie would puke on a child to save the wedding
[0:34:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH
[0:34:01] <%officerodoherty> Pat needs a bot that posts out of content quotes so bad
[0:34:03] <%EliGrumble> best song in the game tim
[0:34:03] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[0:34:04] <MikeNized> I mean, she crouched a lot, yes.
[0:34:05] <%Crimpson> Hi Pat!
[0:34:06] <%Jekado> zombies can't see you if you crouch
[0:34:06] <+ConLin_Arts_> will you play RE2Make after this or after 7?
[0:34:08] <%EliGrumble> time*
[0:34:10] <%legendscar01> par would be a great dad lol
[0:34:12] <%Alpha8087> The tactic of the Woolie, corner crouch
[0:34:12] <+saltytyrz> you mean WHY
[0:34:12] <%officerodoherty> Context* not content
[0:34:12] <phrickshun> pat would throw a child into some one puking to "save" a wedding
[0:34:14] <%Teintstein> tis a fountain
[0:34:15] <stretch_marx> Pat screams at infant "HOW DID YOU SURVIVE"
[0:34:16] <+nathandiel> Her tummy hurts
[0:34:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> MEMES
[0:34:18] <%starotter70> @Fujiwara_92 Holy shit, I was not prepared for that
[0:34:23] <DracaenaLeaf> boss room
[0:34:24] <Fujiwara_92> boss fountain
[0:34:28] <hassanico2> @AngriestPat Deep lore question but where do the 3D RE movies fall in the timeline?
[0:34:28] <+Hasmeister96> sorry I just showed up; how come Pat is playing old re2?
[0:34:31] <MikeNized> And Jill does the same : she crouches to survive.
[0:34:32] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> khadSquirt khadSquirt khadSquirt
[0:34:33] <+ilikegamestime> if they do re5 are they going to use sheva's outfit
[0:34:37] <Ner234> Even WITH context, some of things Pat says are awful LUL
[0:34:38] <%KaiserMario> The idea that Woolie believes he's gonna do a Kishsibe Rohan moment and do a whole plan in his mind before puking is ridiculous...
[0:34:40] <hassanico2> @Hasmeister96 chronological order
[0:34:41] <+Darren716> Hasmeister96 Hes going through the whole series
[0:34:42] <+ConLin_Arts_> He's playing all them RE games!
[0:34:42] <tripfiendWK9> the S in Sherry stands for crouch
[0:34:44] <%blondie_ow> This is the area I wish was in the remake
[0:34:45] <spoonbruh> Because hype train for remake that’s why
[0:34:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Boss Fountain boys
[0:34:53] <SPKTR34> just got here, how much I missed?
[0:34:56] <hassanico2> @Hasmeister96 but the icon for it is the remake because Twitch is dumb
[0:34:57] <%officerodoherty> @hassanico2 I know Vendetta comes after RE6
[0:35:01] <spoonbruh> Not much
[0:35:01] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 is the idea behind puking on the child to blame the kid for puking, making the whole situation less awkward since it was a dumb kid that did it, and not an adult man?
[0:35:03] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> mrfreezepunsbestpuns's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[0:35:03] <Ner234> @SPKTR34 About 20 mins
[0:35:07] <%Vikken141> whooo RE 0 plot hole
[0:35:11] <%huberthecockatoo> @conlin_arts_ probably after 7 since he's going in release order
[0:35:13] <darthriven501> i just got here too, what i miss?
[0:35:14] <spoonbruh> Just pat shouting at a pregnant 12 year old
[0:35:16] <godzookylives> Birkin 2 time
[0:35:17] <SPKTR34> @Ner234 thanks
[0:35:18] <Fujiwara_92> @starotter70 use your imagination... now think of woolie puking on a 6 year old and screaming "DON'T WORRY, THE WEDDING IS SAVED"
[0:35:20] <%Alpha8087> Silent Hill Door
[0:35:24] <+DowntownDrunk> best game ever
[0:35:25] <%Yautjabutts> It's one of those magic doors
[0:35:27] <hassanico2> The timeline for this train machine makes ZERO sense
[0:35:28] <+Hasmeister96> @darren716 OK thanks. I haven't had Twitch installed on my phone for some time so I haven't been keeping up with the streams
[0:35:28] <%Chichen> There was a door here, it's gone now
[0:35:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> But will he play Umbrella Corps????
[0:35:31] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> golbarUmu golbarUmu golbarUmu
[0:35:32] <+Shadowpint> What is exactly so great about the marshaling yard
[0:35:32] <TheNewJapanGuy> "There's no need to go to RE2"
[0:35:33] <%Crimpson> They remodeled
[0:35:33] <darthriven501> no
[0:35:34] <%Alpha8087> Man fuck imagine a Silent Hill/RE crossover
[0:35:35] <Tubit> Respect the bagle
[0:35:36] <rytisone> different facility built using same plans
[0:35:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is there
[0:35:45] <+SweepTheLegoMyEggo> there was a door there, its gone now
[0:35:46] <%EliGrumble> @Shadowpint the music tbh
[0:35:47] <Serge_12> @chichen i like that
[0:35:47] <%Vikken141> yeah its crazy and makes no sense
[0:35:49] <Dragon_Batman> Umbrella really failed in not focusing on their magic door tech
[0:35:52] <hassanico2> Like the Turntable's exact location changes so frequently in a period of 2 days
[0:35:55] <MikeNized> Maybe it got flexsealed.
[0:35:57] <%starotter70> @Fujiwara_92 Thankfully the child is solid enough, so the puck won't soak through and hit the floor
[0:35:57] <+Darren716> God that elevator is fucking dumb
[0:36:02] <black_pariah> umbrella working on that teleport tech
[0:36:10] <Ner234> @Alpha8087 That's two different apocalypse in one
[0:36:10] <Masterman_Zane> that was in outbreak right?
[0:36:10] <%Bailey__gaming> I love that pat has encylopedic knowledge of this game

[0:38:20] <+ConLin_Arts_> Dog Birkin isn't in the original?
[0:38:24] <%Valdorick> That is the shittiest greanade launcher ever
[0:38:25] <MikeNized> You took damage, time to reset the run.
[0:38:26] <%deviljhojho_> @StarlitStunner this is the true RE experiece crikAlert
[0:38:31] <hassanico2> @Crimpson Royal lets you stream the whole game till December
[0:38:35] <%EliGrumble> the remake soundtrack sucks apart from Mr X's theme

[0:43:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The valve rules.

[0:43:30] <天使42199> GabeN me too I love that valve
[0:43:30] <Drivershaft> Yo Pat whens the Caliban Cove playthrough?

[0:48:10] <%Hasmeister96> @gespenst25 dude I've been watching the Eternal Darkness LP; Pat love of re2 can't be stopped
[0:48:11] <hassanico2> gettem in the brain, yeehaw
[0:48:12] <derekwst3> on a serious note, why would you eat plants in a room with plant people near by?
[0:48:13] <%D3rrtyD4n> acid on the brain
[0:48:15] <%unclekulikov> same
[0:48:16] <thelonechris> Just like everything else with a brain
[0:48:17] <%officerodoherty> @ipsenscastle : O
[0:48:18] <%Jekado> what a great design feature exposed brain
[0:48:18] <%SuperSonichu> apatLiz apatLiz
[0:48:21] <rytisone> that's usually how it works
[0:48:25] <blondie_ow> Don't forget the weapon key!
[0:48:30] <hassanico2> This room is only on the escape
[0:48:31] <Prevot> exposed brain seems kinda like a design flaw
[0:48:38] <%SuperSonichu> yeah this is like the last room in remake
[0:48:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Weren't lickers mostly firemen, because the reason they're fucked up and skinless is they were burned to death in the first place?
[0:48:47] <%SuperSonichu> I'm mad that the re3 remake isn't called the re3make
[0:48:50] <+vosmi_6> Too many herb
[0:48:53] <%gespenst25> @Hasmeister96 Weirdly I've watched that LP three times. hmeThink
[0:48:58] <MikeNized> Fuck that room in Outbreak tho.
[0:49:00] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @fruit_pie_the_magician what?
[0:49:00] <megaminimechamocha> R3make
[0:49:02] <%officerodoherty> @supersonichu but what about 3make
[0:49:04] <hassanico2> If you wanna see something dumb look up "Regis Licker"
[0:49:06] <%InugamiTheHound> @Prevot same with exposed heart
[0:49:08] <MoulesFritz> tell that to the tyant with the exposed HEART
[0:49:12] <cant_pick_a_name> what
[0:49:14] <%Maids4lyfe> lickers are mutated zombies
[0:49:14] <megaminimechamocha> R3mak3
[0:49:15] <%SuperSonichu> @officerodoherty shit thats better
[0:49:17] <black_pariah> V-ACT
[0:49:22] <TheNewJapanGuy> That's stupid I love it
[0:49:26] <+ConLin_Arts_> ah yes, Firemen, the people known for licking
[0:49:30] <rytisone> they should call remake Resident Evil 3 Last Escape
[0:49:34] <天使42199> crimson head ?
[0:49:38] <Meekest> Is there an evolution after Lickers?
[0:49:39] <cureneckbeard> Hey Paige, remember not to wear those fake eyelashes!
[0:49:39] <%InugamiTheHound> crimson heads?
[0:49:40] <hassanico2> Zombie -> Crimson Head -> Licker
[0:49:40] <%blondie_ow> So Crimson heads eventually become Lickers?
[0:49:41] <%officerodoherty> @supersonichu RIGHT?? It's SO good and no one uses it 😔
[0:49:42] <%dekkitout> That sounds like a SFV thing
[0:49:44] <%Yautjabutts> #NotAllZombies
[0:49:44] <Prevot> v-skill?
[0:49:46] <warmnoid> so zombo -> crimson head -> licker?
[0:49:51] <Aydarkzero> isn't the other option becoming a crimson?
[0:49:52] <%SuperSonichu> doesn't one in like a few million zombies turn into a tyrant
[0:49:52] <godzookylives> @blondie_ow yes
[0:49:53] <%Jekado> i just realize she's holding a lot of grenades
[0:49:53] <%deviljhojho_> beautiful
[0:49:56] <KingGoblodyte> What kind of liquor?
[0:49:57] <Big_King_Coconut> the ideal we all strive for
[0:49:57] <%unclekulikov> Oh I thought the Lickers were the orphans that were experimented on
[0:49:57] <%deviljhojho_> nature sure is amazing
[0:49:58] <cureneckbeard> Why aren't lickers extremely vulnerable because of their exposed brain
[0:49:59] <+denmonari> "natural"
[0:50:00] <hlreiku> Boom baby
[0:50:01] <ahmz1404> how does this look so good
[0:50:04] <Dragon_Batman> Circle of life really

[0:50:17] <天使42199> hes playing on dolphin with HD texture mod
[0:50:21] <%mh9s> my doctor says if I keep up how I'm doing that I'll eventually turn into liquor too
[0:50:26] <%BayowolfTerra> Its crimson heads too. Are crimson heads canon?
[0:50:27] <%starotter70> Is that the game or Paige?
[0:50:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pre rendered backgrounds, yo
[0:50:42] <Ultimatefool> Is Pat running this on a super Dreamcast or something
[0:50:46] <%honeyman18> So if all these viruses got loose and the whole world was infected it just turns to super fast evolution world?

[0:51:20] <godzookylives> pupate DansGame
[0:51:20] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @SuperSonichu no, in order for a person to become a tyrant is to either have the right DNA for it when bitten by a zombie or exposed by the t-virus, or to be in a lab environment and have scientists specifically set it up to become one

[0:57:13] <TheNewJapanGuy> ULTRA COMBO!
[0:57:13] <ExpressNode> Is there a time limit or does this repeat endlessly?
[0:57:15] <godzookylives> A little overkill
[0:57:18] <+Tacowavable> What type of self-destruct sequence is this? The obvious exits aren't just suddenly exploding and not a single ceiling has caved in!
[0:57:19] <hassanico2> MOO DISC

[0:57:26] <$Dakuu75> remember DISKS?! zoomers!
[0:57:26] <%Ipsenscastle> ELMO DISC
[0:57:27] <+Jolnir> If leon and claire stayed in the rpd they couldve just got away in hunks chopper
[0:57:31] <%edgeyberzerker> oooh those up res backgrounds look nice!
[0:57:39] <hassanico2> Does MO stand for Modus Operandi?
[0:57:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why is there grenades in the medical area???
[0:57:43] <AutechreTwinAphex> ah that's where they got that scanner thing from for the remake
[0:57:51] <MikeNized> Use the vaccine on yourself for the good ending.

[0:58:01] <alwayspronking> For EXTREMEM medicine
[0:58:01] <$Dakuu75> it's the Last Resort
[0:58:02] <trianglehat> for health reasons
[0:58:02] <superchronicc> they are bio grenades
[0:58:03] <hassanico2> Grenades are good for curing zombietis
[0:58:03] <%Jekado> CURE THE SHIT OUT OF SOMEONE
[0:58:03] <Tubit> for emergencies
[0:58:04] <%Alpha8087> Are they just frag grenades?
[0:58:04] <+neeto_makar> If they don't have insurance...
[0:58:05] <californaya> Science grenades.

[0:58:09] <+NinjaWitaSniper> no
[0:58:09] <+Jolnir> No
[0:58:10] <%D00msDayDan> hematic grenades
[0:58:10] <%blondie_ow> Because they had doctors with explosive talent.
[0:58:10] <Make_me_mad> Some security guy left them there when he got a shot in the ass.

[0:58:23] <jimmypurple> Because Umbrella has a thing for weird bombs and shit
[0:58:24] <%legendscar01> Experiment room?
[0:58:24] <ExpressNode> I guess grenades is one sort of cure....
[0:58:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:58:29] <%SuperSonichu> so what was even the point of blowing up the lab if the army nae nae'd the city with a nuke literally a day after

[0:58:39] <+NinjaWitaSniper> resident evil 3 now you coward
[0:58:40] <+CaptainJax> Nah just skip to CVx
[0:58:41] <$Dakuu75> it was a grenade pulled from someone's ass
[0:58:43] <%AkronymCLT> You need the grenade to sterilise wounds
[0:58:46] <hlreiku> All because of green herbs
[0:58:46] <hassanico2> @SuperSonichu It's just an automatic protocol
[0:58:49] <pan_nochal> please play RE3
[0:58:49] <%SolidusRex> Nah it's fine, but thanks for asking
[0:58:51] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat is Rihanna a secret member of umbrella?

[0:58:54] <pan_nochal> Nemesis will shit on you
[0:58:58] <rytisone> for Claire
[0:59:00] <hassanico2> @SuperSonichu no one activated this, it just happened when Birkin went crazy
[0:59:02] <%wizkid50000> pat, do you like chicken tenders
[0:59:04] <$draugrix> @captainjax but what about GUN SURVIVOR
[0:59:04] <%edgeyberzerker> the zombies are just free balling
[0:59:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is Umbrella. Of COURSE there are grenades handy in the surgery area.
[0:59:06] <$Dakuu75> those look like shitty SCP monsters lol
[0:59:07] <+Order_of_Mystery> is Pat doing Leon B, chat?
[0:59:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat For when the tumor you're cutting out turns into a boss fight!
[0:59:10] <TheNewJapanGuy> GOOD GRIEF HE'S NAKED!

[0:59:13] <%Hasmeister96> Sorry, my audio crapped out for some reason. What was Pat's answer to my donation?
[0:59:14] <+neeto_makar> I guess
[0:59:14] <%Teintstein> stupid sexy zombies

[0:59:24] <%Double_Tap_That> Uuoooo
[0:59:27] <%unclekulikov> there were naked zombies in RE1?
[0:59:29] <Gruntini> You didn't do Chris for RE1, so why bother doing B sides for the other games?
[0:59:31] <missingangle> because we need more sexy zombs in this game, Pat
[0:59:32] <phatballlz54> i like how they have buttholes for mouths
[0:59:34] <oniwahoo> "They've become naked but why?" I mean, for the Claire obviously
[0:59:37] <%huberthecockatoo> @order_of_mystery yes
[0:59:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The obvious answer is "to kill the thing they're trying to bring back to life in case it comes back to life and kills them"
[0:59:41] <+CaptainJax> Pat are you gonna play THE DARKSIDE CHRONICLES?

[1:07:01] <+theodolitejones> deffo Paige
[1:07:03] <%Bailey__gaming> Paige
[1:07:03] <%walternatorz> pat would require a step stool
[1:07:03] <hassanico2> Mr. Paige
[1:07:03] <thelonechris> Pat, because he can't reach anything
[1:07:03] <%starotter70> Paige, decreased vision
[1:07:03] <%Teintstein> and she can't see
[1:07:04] <Tampaoster> paige cause of lupus
[1:07:04] <mark_collins45> and vision
[1:07:05] <pan_nochal> Pat can slash knees easier

[1:07:06] <alwayspronking> but Pat I can't reach LUL
[1:07:07] <%unclekulikov> Pat because he couldn't reach some of the puzzles
[1:07:08] <Nekros4442> Paige would be faster though. She has longer legs
[1:07:08] <+TDotGoat> ah, I see I came just in time
[1:07:09] <Dragon_Batman> Hah

[1:07:12] <%cvp5127> fair
[1:07:12] <+Darren716> Paige has shot a gun before though
[1:07:13] <%Jekado> pat would be too short to hit the zombies in the head
[1:07:14] <cbdg> paige would have broken tank controls
[1:07:14] <dukenux> LUL
[1:07:15] <+NitronStreams> LUL THAT GOOD
[1:07:16] <Nekros4442> Paige would have all the walk speed
[1:07:16] <marvel877> ALL OF THE ITEMS
[1:07:16] <+Blargimazombie> Paige blind
[1:07:16] <%Alpha8087> She would have a luigi jump
[1:07:17] <+Darren716> Pat would be fuked
[1:07:17] <%ChaosAethr> Pagie
[1:07:17] <%AncelDeLambert> seems legit
[1:07:17] <%grimm_hatter> always poisoned

[1:07:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Paige is LITERALLY a glass cannon character
[1:07:20] <%Teintstein> Paige doesn't have an orb
[1:07:20] <mark_collins45> Paiges health meter would be in a steady decline the whole game.
[1:07:21] <+PanicSwytch> Noooooooo I missed the stream
[1:07:21] <Asblom> Paige has no map

[1:07:27] <hassanico2> ALYSON COURT the OG Claire
[1:07:27] <%D00msDayDan> paige would have tank controls that don't work properly
[1:07:30] <%Bailey__gaming> Paige has a big sword
[1:07:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Paige
[1:07:30] <%mh9s> less health and a permanently blurry screen
[1:07:30] <Prevot> Paige also can't do shadow puzzles
[1:07:31] <%nofestu2> only pat would have tank controls
[1:07:34] <animalxer> Pat has a set chance to not fire his gun due to mind goblins
[1:07:35] <artoflec> on the upside, Pat could disguise himself as a Hunter pretty easily
[1:07:38] <jrglz90> fröhliche Weihnachten
[1:07:39] <%Jekado> would paige's first aid sprays just be mustard?

[1:15:54] <+King_floppy> Leon is such a twink in this game
[1:15:54] <+ZephynM> So Leon just casually dresses in his Police uniform?
[1:15:56] <%deviljhojho_> @StarlitStunner hey man, if you are gonna use a "model" for all your bioweapons might as well make him a ripped eastern european. That's what happened in the terminator too

[1:16:41] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat He wouldnt have done that lol, because they dont have a ton of blood ns hit on them
[1:16:41] <cureneckbeard> the only reason he hesitated at all is that some of the zombie are white

[1:17:17] <%Teintstein> tokyo drift hell yeah
[1:17:21] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat "you're a cop right" is delivered 10 years older than all of clair's other linex
[1:17:22] <+Caped_Eggy> @neeto_makar Don't plagiarize me Kappa
[1:17:25] <%dukenux> [muffled Leon Please]
[1:17:28] <+Sapientiae> sirens in a zombie outbreak

[1:17:34] <%Keyd00d> NOEL
[1:17:35] <rytisone> they didn't know it was that bad
[1:17:35] <heartlesshealer> NO
[1:17:35] <hassanico2> LEON'S CLONE
[1:17:38] <%deviljhojho_> NO KEVAN
[1:17:38] <MattDemers> Oh no Zombie Leon Model

[1:17:42] <%Ipsenscastle> Cleon is so distracting
[1:17:42] <ajgilmore1> Loen!
[1:17:43] <+Simketh> The enitre city was INFESTED with ZOMbies
[1:17:44] <Devildavacado> Hindsight 20/20.
[1:17:44] <heartlesshealer> Leon voice lines are great
[1:17:44] <spongeofmystery> EVANNNNN

[1:17:46] <+theodolitejones> But if they had left then who knows what might have happened
[1:17:46] <+thenoodle007> LOEN NOOOO
[1:17:50] <%walternatorz> good thing the police station is connected to the entire city
[1:17:50] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat "you're a cop right" is delivered 10 years older than all of clair's other lines
[1:17:50] <+ZephynM> And that is why you wear your seat belt
[1:17:52] <KitsuneManami> WRONG
[1:17:52] <Nekros4442> THATS WH Y YOU WEAR A SEATBELT PAT
[1:17:53] <hlreiku> WHEE
[1:17:53] <trianglehat> this is why you use the seatbelt
[1:17:53] <rufus2k2> why is Steve in the backseat?
[1:17:55] <+theodolitejones> Although it all would have been nuked anyway
[1:17:57] <hassanico2> @AngriestPat so the difference is whether you crash into the pole or swerve backwards into it?
[1:18:00] <Aydarkzero> turns out the station was fucked
[1:18:01] <%Jekado> in all fairness it did have ammo and shit
[1:18:01] <+NinjaWitaSniper> LEON PLEASE! I NEED YOU TO FUCK MY SISTER, CONTINUE THE REDFIELD BLOODLINE! LEON STOP FISHLIPPING AROUND AND GET IN CLAIRES FISHLIPS!
[1:18:03] <Huntercd> Claire must continue the bloodline
[1:18:08] <ajgilmore1> that guys a maniac!
[1:18:08] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Did they say why they took out the Streets from the Remake?
[1:18:09] <Higaraishi> >imagine blieving cops can do something
[1:18:10] <%Shoosler> like a scene from T2
[1:18:11] <cureneckbeard> Why don't they steal a car and drive out of the city and never look back
[1:18:11] <%Jekado> and like a billion grenade rounds
[1:18:13] <%dukenux> i dunno but theres something funny aboutthat zombie falling through the winshield
[1:18:20] <%dukenux> LEEON
[1:18:23] <%Flambage> The city is fucked why did they expect the police station to be under control? @AngriestPat
[1:18:23] <hlreiku> Still in one piece
[1:18:23] <%honeyman18> apatDab_HF apatBig apatDab
[1:18:24] <%deviljhojho_> LEON
[1:18:26] <BoneofMalkav> LMAO
[1:18:27] <PeteyMcPickle> apatRaffle
[1:18:28] <+neutral_guy> They also weren't expecting the police station to be filled with a bunch of dumb puzzles because the chief is crazy or somethign
[1:18:35] <Aydarkzero> At the same time, at the same place
[1:18:37] <+NightOwlSam> it's a shame you've never played this before Pat Kappa
[1:18:41] <天使42199> nice delorean
[1:18:44] <%dukenux> Did they ask Ashley's VA to replicate that line?
[1:18:44] <hassanico2> Yeah reminder that Brian Irons sabotaged the FUCKING HELL out of the Police Station
[1:18:45] <%Crimpson> Speedrun!@
[1:18:48] <%dukenux> Cause it sounded REALLY similar
[1:18:49] <%Jekado> I thought that was the cybertruck
[1:18:50] <Finaldragoon> you know that joke doesn't make any sense because if Leon fucked Claire he'd just be continuing the Kennedy bloodline
[1:18:50] <+NinjaWitaSniper> BEEF HAMBURGERS
[1:18:52] <BoomerUnchained> Run Leon, run
[1:18:55] <$draugrix> @ninjawitasniper no , stop fucking that Asian woman, my sister needs your baby batter

[1:19:32] <Lophostrix_> leon is so hot
[1:19:34] <rufus2k2> did you leave theextra holster for leon?
[1:19:34] <+ZephynM> I kind of wish I was able to play this game as a kid, but I'm also glad my first time was the remak.e
[1:19:35] <+Shadowpint> I prefer Leon in OG and Claire in REmake
[1:19:37] <hlreiku> Can you go back through that door?
[1:19:39] <%EliGrumble> Pat your RE knowledge makes me nervous
[1:19:40] <+NinjaWitaSniper> MARTY ITS YOUR KIDS MARTY! THEY TURNED INTO ZOMBIES MARTY! WE GOTTA GO BACK TO 1998 TO SAVE THEM
[1:19:41] <ImaPlayThis> The B campaign as Leon is sooo much easier
[1:19:44] <Lophostrix_> but leon won't fuck claire
[1:19:46] <%Valdorick> "Marty! Marty I fucked up bad this time! I gave the idea for a zombie outbreak to some guy in sunglasses, and now if we don't get back to the future, it'll be complete global saturation!"
[1:19:47] <Dragon_Batman> Claire in Remake is super fun
[1:19:49] <%Razputin217> 1.21 Gigawatts!
[1:19:51] <rufus2k2> SERPENTINE!
[1:19:53] <godzookylives> Leon is probably my favorite RE protag
[1:19:55] <%Teintstein> it's the Libyans!

[1:20:11] <hlreiku> Helicoptor... whats going on with that helicoptor
[1:20:11] <%blondie_ow> Leon is my favorite RE character, but Claire is the better character in RE2 imo.

[1:20:22] <+Simketh> I kinda wish they made Claire and Leon a little more distinct skill-wise in remake
[1:20:22] <Nekros4442> Wow that guy has stormtrooper aim

[1:20:45] <+corrosivePaladin> Why did that Paul Blart cop have elf ears?
[1:20:45] <%thewildzubat> WE DO IT!
[1:20:45] <+EmotionalFatGuy> stormtroopers were watching over RCPD and that's why they're dead
[1:20:46] <%D3rrtyD4n> hero
[1:20:46] <cureneckbeard> has anyone counted the number of bullets this guy's gun actually shoots, because it seems like about 70
[1:20:46] <godzookylives> Leon just watched the entire thing
[1:20:46] <Heyestus> Cod4 cutscenes all over again
[1:20:47] <phatballlz54> 10/10 luck right there
[1:20:48] <Fujiwara_92> Nat 1
[1:20:48] <%Teintstein> Leon just sat there and watched
[1:20:48] <Higaraishi> what a inconvenient series of events!
[1:20:49] <zedravan> is this the origin of paul blart
[1:20:49] <ajgilmore1> talk about a clusterfuck
[1:20:49] <%baronblank> did not know that was how that crashed, that's hilarious
[1:20:49] <%deviljhojho_> and leon is like "damn"
[1:20:49] <hassanico2> @davimotion96 no
[1:20:50] <%dukenux> litteraly
[1:20:50] <ImaPlayThis> I still love how leon just watches it and did nothing
[1:20:50] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat If for one day you could have sex with any of male RE characters who would it be?
[1:20:51] <%Valdorick> He's doing his best
[1:20:51] <%Jekado> well he did kill those zombies
[1:20:52] <+joeygrizzle> paul blart
[1:20:53] <+NightOwlSam> and leon stood there and watched and did nothing to help that dude
[1:20:53] <jrglz90> das hat bestimmt weh getan
[1:21:01] <%D3rrtyD4n> birbs
[1:21:01] <+thenoodle007> Imagine being in a helicopter and dying by a submachine gun Kappa
[1:21:02] <Aydarkzero> Pat tips Kappa
[1:21:03] <ArseMcDonuts> can't hit zombies 4ft away but sure as hell can hit a helicopter pilot in the air
[1:21:04] <%deviljhojho_> pecked to death
[1:21:06] <mark_collins45> Pro Tip Pat
[1:21:07] <+theodolitejones> Leon helped by staying out of the way
[1:21:08] <%deviljhojho_> damn
[1:21:09] <pan_nochal> in Remake it's not even explained why the heli eats shit, it just does
[1:21:09] <rufus2k2> ignore helpful crows
[1:21:13] <%grimm_hatter> well their wasn't much he could do
[1:21:15] <+ZephynM> Birds going after you just like in the movie "birds"
[1:21:16] <%dukenux> It sure is Hitchcock in here
[1:21:16] <Aydarkzero> what an idiot dying to birds Kappa
[1:21:17] <Finaldragoon> 2 kills, 1 team kill, and 1 death. that cop has a perfect 1:1 ratio for this map
[1:21:17] <$draugrix> when you roll a nat 1 on to hit but max damage
[1:21:21] <hassanico2> @AngriestPat so what extra items and setpieces can you leave for Leon B after playing Claire?
[1:21:23] <cureneckbeard> AngriestCat
[1:21:24] <kerotuyu> IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS KILLED BY A CROW OR SOMETHING
[1:21:24] <heartlesshealer> I HEAR THE BABY
[1:21:25] <+Maswrath> Did Leon stand there and not help?
[1:21:25] <%SolidusRex> I remember my dad was playing the RE2make and he reached the part where the helicopter crashed. I told him how it crashed in the original, he said that was dumb and it makes sense why they changed it. He's not wrong TBH

[1:29:43] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @hassanico2 oh wasnt sure what you meant im pretty sure in that situation they were used to keep snoopers from finding out whats actually going on like how in 3 the nemesis is specifcally going after stars members that already know
[1:29:45] <phrickshun> while I understand the RPD is a converted museum of sorts, why does it still have puzzles and shit
[1:29:47] <vampireinarm> coulndt lean have just climbed up and reached in for the key
[1:29:47] <BurdRightsActivist> @derekwst3 You have to earn your zapping system mastery certificate
[1:29:54] <Mrmcrolan> Bruh, that key could just as easily have gone down the floor drain. WHAT THEN HUH!?
[1:29:56] <天使42199> @phrickshun cause puzzles make it fun
[1:29:56] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @hassanico2 thats me just taking a wild ass guess of the top of my head atm

[1:30:17] <%dukenux> Are we zappin yet?
[1:30:18] <+neutral_guy> Isin't the reason the police station is full of dumb puzzles and shit is because it used to be a museum or something?

[1:33:30] <%dukenux> still Fine
[1:33:32] <%Ipsenscastle> What's the lore re typewriters, do they just stop to write a haiku every so often?
[1:33:35] <jrglz90> zombies überall als wäre man in einem Videospiel
[1:33:36] <+NinjaWitaSniper> I liked this room alot in RE2Make because it has no ceiling
[1:33:37] <rufus2k2> yeah claire kicks
[1:33:41] <Aydarkzero> @heartlesshealer only when you get ankle bit
[1:33:42] <%blondie_ow> Such a shame they took out the head stomp for when a zombie bites your leg in the remake.
[1:33:43] <%D3rrtyD4n> thanks me
[1:33:43] <%Alpha8087> Like imagine if Jack Baker just falcon punched through the metal door
[1:33:47] <%dukenux> nah it's canon, the zombie didn't bit through material
[1:33:50] <%Cervantas> Is THIS the zapping system?
[1:33:53] <derekwst3> i remember this room
[1:33:54] <PeteyMcPickle> ZAPPING SYSTEM
[1:33:56] <Aydarkzero> @blondie_ow a real shame
[1:33:58] <Mrmcrolan> I was just about to say that this looks a lot like RE2 remake, and then I realised how fucking retarded I am -_-
[1:34:03] <%ace_cfa44> and it's making zapping sounds
[1:34:04] <+Kurt_0> PogChamp
[1:34:04] <%grimm_hatter> but leon got here first HOW
[1:34:04] <xeros720> oh, beat claire's scenario already?
[1:34:07] <heartlesshealer> Even if it's only the one situation, it's still pretty neat
[1:34:08] <$Dakuu75> that seems like a stretch
[1:34:13] <%dukenux> But spray??
[1:34:16] <fairore> @mrmcrolan lmao
[1:34:19] <extradopeness> you kids haven’t seen a pink vinyl purse lying around I’m just dyin to get my cigarettes
[1:34:19] <天使42199> why not spray ?
[1:34:20] <uberhox> FAKE FAN
[1:34:20] <rufus2k2> man Jack Baker had a rough life
[1:34:22] <Aydarkzero> first aid sprays LUL
[1:34:22] <+Dingalow> Pat
[1:34:25] <%Cervantas> is he doing all run combos or just this one?
[1:34:27] <pan_nochal> fuck the spray
[1:34:30] <SilverFaustX> secondary fan
[1:34:31] <%Jekado> i don't think he wants it
[1:34:32] <天使42199> lowers rank :(
[1:34:35] <derekwst3> healing is for losers
[1:34:36] <+TungstenViper> @ipsenscastle they write a journal of what's happening
[1:34:37] <heartlesshealer> also showcases how weak bones get in the zombos
[1:34:38] <rufus2k2> also End of Zoe is best RE7 DLC
[1:34:39] <black_pariah> pat dont care about no spray
[1:34:43] <Supervyxen> Why does the game look weird
[1:34:44] <NeroIscariot12> spray ruins rank
[1:34:45] <xeros720> he's just doing one of each to get the real ending
[1:34:46] <%StaceMcGate> I like how the zombos keep their hats on
[1:34:53] <Aydarkzero> Zoe Kreygasm
[1:34:56] <rufus2k2> @Supervyxen GC emulation plus texture mod
[1:34:58] <%Ganerumo> What trick ? I just came in
[1:35:02] <hassanico2> @AngriestPat you learned a new trick after 20 years, that's cool
[1:35:02] <derekwst3> those are police, they are just trying to help you
[1:35:03] <Run44forrest> FUCK RANK this post was made by first aid spray hggGANG
[1:35:05] <%deviljhojho_> very smart crikIQ
[1:35:09] <%Ipsenscastle> @TungstenViper I'm establishing a haiku headcanon then
[1:35:13] <mark_collins45> Maximum killing engaged
[1:35:14] <+Shadowpint> Why did the games rank you down for first aid sprays in particular, it's not like full heals with R+G or 3 G herbs are that hard ti get
[1:35:14] <%D3rrtyD4n> i am so smrt
[1:35:14] <fairore> that door animation always gave the feeling of getting jumped scared
[1:35:15] <xeros720> one weird trick?
[1:35:18] <Supervyxen> O shit I never knew RE2 was on the GameCube
[1:35:23] <jrglz90> gute Nacht liebe Freunde
[1:35:24] <%dukenux> This ONE trick Umbrella doesn't tell you about(Zombies HATE IT)!!
[1:35:30] <Aydarkzero> so how come Leon even has a lighter?
[1:35:36] <cureneckbeard> pro strats
[1:35:40] <rufus2k2> @Supervyxen yeah a lot of the REs came out busget price
[1:35:41] <NaturalGear> I can't believe Pat invented RE2
[1:35:43] <JetpackMcQuack> For the herbs
[1:35:46] <Fujiwara_92> You spend more bullets this way tho, if im not wrong
[1:35:46] <extradopeness> 20 rupees
[1:35:46] <hassanico2> @Shadowpint Using 1 item vs. having to combine multiple?
[1:35:46] <+corrosivePaladin> You know what saves more time tho? Running past them like a pro
[1:35:48] <天使42199> @Supervyxen you could get every main resident evil from re4 and back
[1:35:54] <+CaptainJax> So nobody ever lit that fireplace before today?
[1:35:55] <%RoninRorinth> RoninRorinth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! 
[1:36:01] <rufus2k2> I still can't get over that zombies track you by SOUND
[1:36:06] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat is this a bit?
[1:36:12] <rufus2k2> which is why the skating trick exists for speed runners
[1:36:12] <mark_collins45> 10 secrets that Capcom doesn't want you to know!
[1:36:16] <+TungstenViper> @aydarkzero a gift from when he joined the rpd
[1:36:21] <Run44forrest> what if you sprayed a zombie with first aid and that just cured them. like lucatiel not knowing how to use a human effigy
[1:36:29] <Cecion> The T Virus was originally discovered in Pat's bathroom
[1:36:34] <Aydarkzero> weird
[1:36:41] <xeros720> the P Virus you mean
[1:36:44] <cureneckbeard> yeyeye

[1:36:54] <fairore> @angel42199 I think Nintendo got Revelation 1 and 2
[1:36:56] <warmnoid> i did that shit in fatal frame
[1:37:01] <Aydarkzero> those zombies must be using Astro Headsets Kappa
[1:37:02] <+Dingalow> Spazkid calls it "air walking"
[1:37:02] <hassanico2> COOL MECHANICS IN ANCIENT GAMES
[1:37:04] <cureneckbeard> There should be a smell detection radius in case Leon farts
[1:37:04] <+badjab326> Which version is this?
[1:37:09] <$Dakuu75> in this generation of games, they had that technology? impressive
[1:37:12] <hassanico2> @badjab326 gamecube emulation
[1:37:12] <%InugamiTheHound> someone did that same skating trick for MGS1 on the ps1
[1:37:20] <%officerodoherty> @cureneckbeard LUL LUL
[1:37:21] <%Jekado> i do that in most of my games in general because it looks dumb

[1:37:32] <jrglz90> uralte spiele mit krassen Mechaniken
[1:37:40] <%Jekado> i hear baby
[1:37:43] <hassanico2> @AngriestPat What 's the dumbest thing you genuine dislike about this game?
[1:37:43] <+Nomicro4u> What are thoughts on new Jill design ?
[1:37:46] <+monky3d> did you ever unlock 4th survivor in re2?
[1:37:47] <xeros720> mgs1 even tells you about it in codec conversations, i don't think it's as useful though
[1:37:47] <Supervyxen> Yeah just mash R1 to equip and unequip a weapon in MGS1 and you move completely silently.
[1:37:48] <+CaptainJax> Pat you're not supposed to say the emulator words
[1:37:49] <BurdRightsActivist> shut the fuk up BB
[1:37:49] <%KaiserMario> Isn't the GameCube Pat's favorite console ever?
[1:37:56] <Mrmcrolan> Elmo?
[1:37:58] <+TungstenViper> yeah with the noisy ground
[1:38:01] <+Shadowpint> New Jill is good
[1:38:07] <cureneckbeard> the gamecube is pat's favourite colour: blue
[1:38:09] <%radda343> babby me missed every single one of these hidden bits of ammo
[1:38:09] <%Ganerumo> it's not a super complicated system in terms of execution, usually it just means your character has an invisible sphere around them that expands with noise and enemies also have one for detection
[1:38:09] <+Shadowpint> New Carlos is hot af
[1:38:09] <Aydarkzero> i've only ever played the ps3 version
[1:38:10] <Prevot> old Jill is better
[1:38:13] <+Dingalow> That statue puzzle is tricky, first time
[1:38:15] <DracaenaLeaf> uh uh uh
[1:38:15] <Coystick> Ah yes, the iconic blue Gamecube
[1:38:17] <rufus2k2> COP PARTY COP PARTY COP PARTY
[1:38:20] <zedravan> pretty sure this mod uses the sourcenext's HQ fmvs too
[1:38:23] <%Takreth> uhhhhhh
[1:38:23] <Ner234> Of course
[1:38:24] <%InugamiTheHound> yeah you gotta equip and unequip the gun and snake will skate along. Its good for not making a noise near rex lair
[1:38:24] <%Jekado> hat protects from bullets
[1:38:24] <Skadisson> 12 bricks
[1:38:25] <%Cervantas> gamecube is purple
[1:38:26] <+CaptainJax> Just like in TF2
[1:38:27] <%deviljhojho_> respect their authority
[1:38:27] <%officerodoherty> @shadowpint same
[1:38:28] <+Nomicro4u> I don't like new Jill just doesn't look the same
[1:38:28] <Supervyxen> @xeros720 Only Twin Snakes tells you about moving silently. In the original, Snake is like "I can't do it"
[1:38:29] <Dragon_Batman> Hats really give that power
[1:38:29] <jrglz90> zombiemütze
[1:38:30] <%radda343> the hats absorb the bullets apatHat
[1:38:36] <%SolidusRex> Zombie Sex With Hats On
[1:38:36] <fairore> her design looks too much like Clair imo
[1:38:37] <%Ipsenscastle> Their power resides in the hat
[1:38:39] <rytisone> that's why X wears one
[1:38:40] <+Remery_> hat on = more health, naked = more dmg?
[1:38:40] <Mcgack2> it gives them Hat rage energy right?
[1:38:41] <天使42199> @Nomicro4u why would they make it look the same ?
[1:38:42] <pan_nochal> STAAARSS office
[1:38:44] <Cecion> new Jill's hair look jank
[1:38:45] <Skadisson> ...i just found... 5 cops.

[1:41:30] <valcheese> why he screm....why the baby screm
[1:41:32] <Gruntini> Fun Fact: The VP70's stock is actually built to do that
[1:41:35] <%Ganerumo> Fun fact, that gun actually behaves the same way IRL, the burst mechanism is activated by the stock @AngriestPat
[1:41:37] <extradopeness> what a beautiful duwang
[1:41:41] <xeros720> elmo keeps screaming to find that answer
[1:41:44] <arivalappears> Does it ever waste ammo by doing that?
[1:41:47] <cureneckbeard> Forgotten Weapons has a video on it
[1:41:48] <Mrmcrolan> U need to fed the BB
[1:41:50] <+TungstenViper> that's a holster in real life
[1:41:50] <Skadisson> it also stuns the tyrant with enough ammunition naroDerp
[1:41:50] <Gruntini> VP70
[1:41:52] <+Simketh> can you still get the costume key from Brad?
[1:42:09] <jrglz90> wie lange willst du noch streamen?
[1:42:10] <+NinjaWitaSniper> you mean stock?
[1:42:13] <%nofestu2> the holster?
[1:42:14] <Aydarkzero> shame i hate the burst fire
[1:42:16] <%Ganerumo> it's a stock and holster
[1:42:16] <%radda343> Forgotten Weapons did a video on it
[1:42:17] <%dukenux> oh right, back when no one cared about Gun trademarks
[1:42:18] <+Dingalow> Daaaaamn
[1:42:24] <%Ipsenscastle> he's Canadian, leave him alone
[1:42:25] <+Darren716> Funny enough the stock doubles as a holste
[1:42:25] <%Ganerumo> pistol stocks double as holsters 90% of the time
[1:42:26] <StarlitStunner> Leon the Professional
[1:42:27] <Fujiwara_92> Holster Kappa
[1:42:27] <%comfyman12> It's a holster and a stock together!
[1:42:28] <+asgard147> monkaS
[1:42:31] <+Darren716> So pat is correct
[1:42:31] <Coystick> Forgotten Weapons gotta cover more vidya/movie weapons their vid on Mando's gun was great.
[1:42:32] <Tubit> details... schmeetails...
[1:42:33] <Mrmcrolan> Holster, stock...Basically the same thing really.
[1:42:34] <xeros720> he lives in canada, he doesn't have to worry about random firearm death like the U.S. does
[1:42:34] <%D00msDayDan> don't forget the tommy gun magazine
[1:42:37] <%InugamiTheHound> HK aka heckler & koch vp70m
[1:42:38] <+chaumiester> The VP70 also has one of the worst triggers in Gun History. Described to be liked to a staple gun in real life
[1:42:39] <%dukenux> Lock Stock
[1:42:40] <+Dingalow> Canadians don't know gun slang

[1:43:45] <+chaumiester> @AngriestPat Was there a reason the VP70 was chosen for Leon's Main gun in RE2 instead of giving him a generic Samurai Edge?

[2:03:08] <+neeto_makar> Crazy how much harder Ben the journalist gets it in the original comapred to remake
[2:03:09] <PeteyMcPickle> Most RE2 mods are just nude mods though
[2:03:11] <+NobleJedi> ADA WAYT
[2:03:12] <+Shadowpint> I'm gonna try a fun (yet unbalanced) mod that lets you have all weapons on both characters
[2:03:13] <天使42199> max should use the DMX mr x theme mod
[2:03:17] <Coystick> @commanderclaw HER BUTTHOLE WHISTLES LEON!
[2:03:18] <%blondie_ow> Still wish the remake had more radio interactions. Claire and Leon don't even use them to talk to each other
[2:03:20] <%Ganerumo> Is MH World similar to a game as a service or is it something you can actually put down and not play for a month without feeling incredibly left out
[2:03:23] <hassanico2> Chat would you a Mrs. X?

[2:03:56] <fairore> @neeto_makar really getting your face squash is pretty brutal imo
[2:03:58] <%officerodoherty> The spiders in the OG resident evil games look so fluffy and cute
[2:04:01] <hassanico2> Mr.X Handler is best Handler
[2:04:02] <%euronymooose> who thought spiders were a good idea
[2:04:03] <%BioHunter> theres a lot of story bits i like better in og re2 better than remake
[2:04:06] <SilverFaustX> u can play mhw and pause for months np
[2:04:09] <hassanico2> Like holy crap Capcom you geniuses
[2:04:12] <fairore> nvm
[2:04:12] <%Ipsenscastle> @Maximilian_DOOD Just floating the idea of a co-op Iceborne stream with Pat to get him up to speed on the DLC! He'll protest because he's a grumpy loner but it would be super rad
[2:04:23] <%Jekado> but the seasonaly stuff comes back every year and not a lot of dlc
[2:04:27] <%officerodoherty> And I hate spiders tbh
[2:04:27] <%Ganerumo> Cool, I'll buy it while it's on sale then, thanks for the advice
[2:04:28] <%zeroarturia> There is a full animated Heather Mason mod for Claire.
[2:04:28] <Ianrazz> Why does the dialogue of 90's and 2000's games read like porn?? Not talking about RE2
[2:04:38] <fairore> @hassanico2 it's so weird though lol
[2:04:39] <%Jekado> i thought its on sale now
[2:04:47] <%euronymooose> lol that made me jump
[2:04:47] <%Ganerumo> yeah it's why I was asking
[2:04:48] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> Which is a steal tbf
[2:04:49] <SilverFaustX> iceborne also on sale on ps4
[2:04:52] <hassanico2> @fairore Do it to protect his smile
[2:04:56] <天使42199> @Ianrazz it has the same chees writing and poor voice acting porn typically has
[2:04:57] <+Nomicro4u> grab those feets

[2:05:18] <hassanico2> @SuperSonichu Ouroboros seems waaaaay worse
[2:05:21] <extradopeness> I need to get Iceborne but I’m still doing Elders so I’m not in a rush to buy it
[2:05:23] <+Sartastic> zero clips
[2:05:24] <Blank9> zero swords in your shotgun
[2:05:25] <Heyestus> Plagas are stronger than Virus mutants.
[2:05:26] <+CaptainJax> perfected ouroboros is way more nuts
[2:05:27] <%RedSharkHC> funny how weak the lickers are here, compared to remake
[2:05:30] <zafooru> 0 SNAILS in your shotgun
[2:05:41] <%valriot> Man I just remembered when Paige thought the Licker said "Oh boy!"

[2:12:48] <Coystick> I thought you said Hamgun parts the second time
[2:12:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> gives a reason to play both versions
[2:12:49] <Ianrazz> Hopefully this new gangbusters that Capcom brought in 2019 can restore its fighting games division to the good ol days
[2:12:50] <fairore> @questionableradioactivity like are talking about one or two btw
[2:12:50] <%SuperSonichu> the fact that you can actually burn nemesis arms/head off and he still comes at you is 100% the rawest shit
[2:12:59] <fairore> sgit
[2:13:00] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> @fairore Either

[2:13:47] <天使42199> I think re make 1 is the better remake but remake 2 is cool
[2:13:47] <%SoFarFetched> @agadejobi they include her tube top for RE3 Remake if you pre order.
[2:13:52] <%ElenaManetta> The word magnum has been ruined for me by Danny Devito

[2:17:31] <%ElenaManetta> This HD mod makes the game look like how you thought old games looked in your kid head
[2:17:34] <blackened61986> In remake those lickers will straight up run you the fuck down.
[2:17:41] <天使42199> @pan_nochal haha the original music does have the Title screen "resident evil 2" voice if you keep the OG music enabled and then start the game up again
[2:17:43] <$Afterman_> pat and his collection of plugs
[2:17:43] <+Nomicro4u> need more liquor
[2:17:44] <%Ipsenscastle> I read that as 'butthole plug'. Clearly Freudian

[2:17:47] <spooktrain> i won't even eat the corn chip ill probably toss it out
[2:17:52] <天使42199> it just doesnt have the gamecube RE2 voice which is the best one

[2:24:38] <SaltyGuyMan> is it me or does Leon sound a little bit like Carth from KOTOR?
[2:24:40] <%theodolitejones> Both of them are gonna have terrible UTI after that sewer run
[2:24:41] <+Robbo169> I wish PS1 games looked clean like this back in the day
[2:24:46] <%QuestionableRadioactivity> @Ultimatefool But it's not ZOMBIE ICKIES
[2:24:48] <+Remery_> Leon likes his women with a little sewer grime on them
[2:24:52] <%euronymooose> they both probably stink like shit
[2:24:55] <rytisone> the hell is wrong with music?
[2:24:57] <cureneckbeard> Yeah if you like go through a sewer and touch your face you will get an infection on your face
[2:24:57] <JunkyardCrow> Ada treats Leon like a baby forever

[2:26:00] <Make_me_mad> Everyone in the Resident Evil universe just smells like corpses, shit, gun-oil and herb residue. No wonder no one wants to fuck. It must have taken a heroic effort for Ashley to stay horny.
[2:26:07] <天使42199> how come
[2:26:07] <+Shadicara> Bio weapons are for pussies

[2:37:12] <PeteyMcPickle> poo in the bullet hole
[2:37:12] <+asgard147> That's not great limesS
[2:37:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Anti-biotics may help.
[2:37:14] <%theodolitejones> Septicemia
[2:37:14] <codesounds> John dead Yes, I mean Wait? -Leon
[2:37:15] <+Nomicro4u> he loves it
[2:37:17] <%speaks2much> sewer sepsis
[2:37:17] <%dukenux> All these zombie bites made him immune, its fine
[2:37:17] <Tracazoid> Like that Evil Within 1 chainsaw would Sebastian gets
[2:37:18] <%SharkMissile> That's what blue herbs are for.
[2:37:19] <rytisone> Leon is super lucky boi
[2:37:20] <%deviljhojho_> they get bitten all the time and nothing happens to them
[2:37:21] <insomnioid> no it's fine
[2:37:22] <+Simketh> He's got Gangrene, gangpurple, and gangblue
[2:37:22] <%SharkMissile> You iknow...sepsis.
[2:37:22] <Ultimatefool> No shut up
[2:37:23] <%Shoosler> Ada could catch a pipe :) you know what I mean
[2:37:24] <ohgodscorpions> herbs prevent infection
[2:37:24] <%Jeemukun> it's fiiiine
[2:37:25] <TheNewJapanGuy> "Magic Herbs"
[2:37:27] <heartlesshealer> the bandage isn't even close over his wound I love it
[2:37:27] <ThorgrimFunhammer> oh he dead
[2:37:27] <Dragon_Batman> I mean his wound is above the water level but if it happened yup
[2:37:28] <roundii> RE2: Leon has MRSA
[2:37:29] <iggdrafolium> he's 100 percent getting ligma and all that sht
[2:37:30] <%Big_Dream> nah he got herbs
[2:37:30] <+Remery_> No in RE sewer water is an aphrodisiac
[2:37:31] <+CaptainJax> The most evil boss fight of all: Gangrene
[2:37:33] <%euronymooose> herbs cure all
[2:37:33] <+ilpeggiore_> is this some kind of texture pack for emulators?
[2:37:37] <%Sadira_snack_attack> Herbs are truly magic
[2:37:37] <munchkay> Video games Pat
[2:37:41] <+asgard147> I did not know you could do that limesPoggers
[2:37:42] <BoneofMalkav> Yet Leon's plot armor prevents that
[2:37:43] <%Gogogolem> What you don't know is Racoon city has the cleanest most sterile sewers.
[2:37:44] <Meekest> Bulslhit
[2:37:49] <Devildavacado> I'm sure if Leon can fight off a zombie virus, he can fight off sewer filth.
[2:37:50] <Aydarkzero> the actual biohazard is safer than the in game biohazard
[2:37:53] <rubbishbinge> So what you mean is peepeepoopoo is the ultimate BIOWEAPON?
[2:37:54] <cureneckbeard> cured with green urbs
[2:37:57] <ranarath> Remember in Evil Within 1, Seabass get a chainsaw cut on his leg and then trapes through a sewer and a blood pit before it is magically healed? Good times.
[2:37:57] <SilverFaustX> do canadians taste like syrup?
[2:37:58] <Ner234> Medicine in the RE universe is basially magic. He's fine
[2:37:58] <+Remery_> I thought he said Canada
[2:37:59] <Drusain> If Ada could heal Leon now why didn't she do it when he was bleeding on the ground?
[2:37:59] <trianglehat> a green herb a day keeps the T-virus at bay
[2:38:00] <%Ipsenscastle> Leon is soaked in peepoops for the entire remainder of the game
[2:38:00] <Coystick> Wade through Ada's dank waters, Leon
[2:38:01] <%ElenaManetta> Can you imagine how embarrassing it is to be in the zombie apocalypse and die due to infected wound

[2:38:12] <rytisone> Clocktower?
[2:38:12] <Blank9> they get bit in canon, but they are more resistant to the virus
[2:38:14] <Aydarkzero> no
[2:38:15] <$Dakuu75> In Canada the Maple-Trees can bite you. it's how they defend their SAP
[2:38:16] <+apocplz> ???
[2:38:17] <%mh9s> a queer meter, to measure how much Leon is giving me a boner
[2:38:17] <%Vikken141> apatHoldon

[2:38:18] <%mistermastergreg> "GREEN HERBS"
[2:38:20] <SPKTR34> fear meter sounds like a pain

[2:38:31] <SulfurousAcid> raccoon city is in Wisconsin because everything is a shithole
[2:38:32] <BoneofMalkav> Paige and her Clock Tower
[2:38:34] <Blank9> it's like sex without a condom, you go pee afterwards and you're safe
[2:38:34] <%Wrashis> i think its much less realistic that they survive hordes of zombies unscratched than not dying from sewer shit
[2:38:34] <+mgskomododragon> the herd could be weed.
[2:38:35] <plzza_kun> Sanity's Requiem had a sanity meter and that was a cool mechanic
[2:38:35] <Ivarent> big spoder
[2:38:37] <%Ipsenscastle> Paige your sanity meter is low
[2:38:38] <Skadisson> PAIGE WAIT
[2:38:39] <+Maswrath> Isn’t it a 1/10 chance to be immune?
[2:38:40] <SilverFaustX> bang
[2:38:40] <goddamndavid> no see they would smoke the herbs and calm down
[2:38:40] <+PenmanLupine> Why do I hear a red headed shrill harpy?
[2:38:41] <%TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> Paige... they can actually get bit? Why would a meter that makes them think they're gonna get bit matter? Like... they DO get bit?
[2:38:43] <+dumbgrayhair> Ada is helping.

[2:39:10] <PeteyMcPickle> Imagine if clocktower was good
[2:39:10] <+Simketh> Has Paige ever played NightCry? Spiritual successor to Clock Tower
[2:39:11] <+mgskomododragon> the herbs could be weed and it would just be everyone is getting high so they wouldnt go insane with all the zombies running around
[2:39:11] <TheNewJapanGuy> Says LOL player Pat
[2:39:12] <%Gogogolem> "why don't they make the games not meant for the way i like them." Paige 2019.
[2:39:13] <heartlesshealer> Example: RE1 dialogue
[2:39:13] <%Jekado> but pat can be scissor man because he's the right height
[2:39:15] <Make_me_mad> @TonyPullMyDTRedgrave She means instead of getting bit. So that you don't have the dumb in-universe logic of them never taking a hit.
[2:39:16] <ThirdPersonPhil> Paige LP Haunting Grounds
[2:39:16] <$Dakuu75> she's too tired for this Pat-related-BS it seems lol
[2:39:18] <Devildavacado> Does RE ever explain what's in the herbs, or are we just supposed to accept that they're just really healthy for you?
[2:39:18] <%mh9s> pat's weird bag will go unshaken this eve
[2:39:21] <%Ipsenscastle> who cares she has bad bagel opinions
[2:39:22] <ImaPlayThis> in fairness if you had a sanity meter and herbs refilled it then couldnt re in that case just be a guy trippin mad balls lol
[2:39:24] <King_thunder365> What’s your favorite entry in the Clocktower series, Paige?
[2:39:25] <munchkay> My friend was so stupid, he said "Yeah all the RE main cast is imune, cus they get bitten and they're fine"

[2:39:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Make the Health into Stamina, representing your ability to break out of grabs or whatever. No Stamina means fatal bite.
[2:39:36] <blackened61986> If Paige tries to fucking turn RE into Clock Tower one more time I'm going to lose my shit.
[2:39:36] <ohgodscorpions> extra extra bacon

[2:39:48] <BoneofMalkav> If Clock Tower supported the SNES Mouse controller, I would love it more.
[2:39:50] <%SharkMissile> Because Clock Tower isn't a Skeleton or a Goblin
[2:39:53] <%JD_Lars> Ketchup ruins everything

[2:58:35] <%InugamiTheHound> remember when matt yelled at woolie for eating "steak and eggs" for BREAKFAST! even thought steak and eggs is a common breakfast in america!
[2:58:36] <%RedSharkHC> to burn those 3 plant dudes, that's about it
[2:58:36] <blackened61986> All pork can basically poison you.

[2:58:43] <+Remery_> white gravy is the devils gravy
[2:58:43] <%Ipsenscastle> OMG I saw a picture of chitlins, it looked like something from the Bloodborne fishing hamlet

[2:58:50] <%Niney_Who> White Gravy is best for Fried food

[2:58:53] <%SoFarFetched> @euronymooose southern food thing.
[2:58:59] <%Niney_Who> Especially chicken fried steak
[2:59:02] <nobknee> Dip the pineapple pizza in the white gravy.
[2:59:04] <$Dakuu75> Man, Chat's ADD is kicking up a storm today lol
[2:59:05] <%radda343> @euronymooose chitlins are just fluffier pork scratchings
[2:59:08] <PeteyMcPickle> White gravy = Baby batter
[2:59:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[2:59:12] <marvel877> @InugamiTheHound Yeah, but Woolie didn't even have eggs with it, thus making it not a breakfast meal at all.
[2:59:14] <+Maswrath> Anything in enough excess can poison you
[2:59:15] <%Niney_Who> Chicken Fried Steak is so good
[2:59:16] <%euronymooose> ohhhhh ok! i can picture that

[3:00:38] <atgithursdays> Meat Gravy > Mushroom Gravy

[3:01:03] <PeteyMcPickle> apatWink
[3:01:03] <%ElenaManetta> Change your twitch layout so instead it looks like the game is inside a thought bubble coming out of your head

[3:01:18] <%Alpha8087> I jsut saw Cats got patched??? I didnt know that was a thing
[3:01:21] <pan_nochal> the Pee Room Key
[3:01:21] <nobknee> Chat agrees with Woolie on vomit. Thus, we are always to be ignored.
[3:01:23] <fairore> @captainjax yes you are correct
[3:01:23] <%SharkMissile> @SoFarFetched Dang, I totally missed doing that. Oh well, next month. :p
[3:01:24] <rytisone> Pee Room Key
[3:01:25] <kazadog> put stink lines above the face cam for the true experience
[3:01:28] <Enyoyable> @ElenaManetta I want to see a streamer do that now
[3:01:28] <%dukenux> When the Engineer from TF2 says "CREAM GRAVY" does he mean the white one, or regular?
[3:01:29] <+Remery_> chat gets downplayed alot but sometimes are cheeky
[3:01:32] <atgithursdays> Can the next podcast feature Plague of Gripes after he's watched Cats? I'd be interested to hear his opinion
[3:01:32] <%Ipsenscastle> apatWink_SA Santa Elmo brings White gravy to all the children
[3:01:32] <ohgodscorpions> itz n9t called white gravy its called biscuit sauce
[3:01:34] <%Typhaeon> DLC in cinemas? God help us
[3:01:34] <%grimm_hatter> yes the magnum clearly needs to be stronger
[3:01:39] <%radda343> @dukenux the white one
[3:01:39] <%Niney_Who> Engineer is Texan so white gravy
[3:01:39] <dredshift> @AngriestPat which would you suggest for seeing on Christmas: the 5/10 Rise of Skywalker or the amazing disaster Cats?
[3:01:42] <extradopeness> Tomato Gravy is the TRUE southern gravy
[3:01:43] <%trunubus> wow just got here, the game looks SICK!
[3:01:45] <$Dakuu75> Leon is dribbling basket balls with those foot-steps. ffs
[3:01:49] <%BayowolfTerra> g virus is a great bioweapon. has to be completely incinerated to stay down.
[3:01:51] <%Niney_Who> Tomato gravy doesn't exist
[3:01:52] <%Niney_Who> I refuse
[3:01:54] <Mexrage> i wish all RE games had unlimited ammo unlock, doing a full run with unlimited magnum is so satisfying on those games @AngriestPat
[3:01:57] <%Niney_Who> That can't be athing
[3:01:58] <+Nomicro4u> save your money and see neither
[3:02:00] <%dukenux> @radda343 whoa, i just learned new trivia about TF2 in 2019
[3:02:02] <%SoFarFetched> @Niney_Who wait it's a thing?
[3:02:04] <%radda343> tommy tallirico invented footsteps
[3:02:06] <%Jekado> i heard the new cats was weird and about mostly cats wanting to fuck at least thats like every review so far
[3:02:06] <%InugamiTheHound> Pat has already seen the star wars movie
[3:02:08] <TyrantBelial> Cats atleast seems entertaining
[3:02:08] <extradopeness> It is and it’s delicious in rice
[3:02:09] <nobknee> Tomato gravy on rice is good.
[3:02:12] <%Niney_Who> Someone said tomato Gravy and I refuse to allow it to exist as fact
[3:02:16] <+Shadicara> Incinerated and a building pretty much dropped on it
[3:02:17] <%Ipsenscastle> @dredshift pretty sure he'd just recommend knives out
[3:02:20] <+Remery_> America will eat anything
[3:02:24] <%Niney_Who> I mean yes
[3:02:29] <%Niney_Who> I've eaten alligator
[3:02:30] <%euronymooose> T virus that just turns people into Tommy Wiseau
[3:02:31] <Calek> tomato gravy is just warm ketchup
[3:02:33] <%Archer2150> Because food is good
[3:02:33] <+Order_of_Mystery> Woolie's stance on vomit is selfless and good, y'all are wrong woolieMIRIN
[3:02:36] <+Remery_> shuddap
[3:02:37] <+Shadicara> Go go leon shotgun
[3:02:40] <%dukenux> id eat an alligator
[3:02:41] <logan224312> why's leon wrapped in bandages?
[3:02:42] <%BayowolfTerra> and it comes back stronger Everytime it's knocked down. like Saiyan's.
[3:02:42] <dredshift> @Ipsenscastle I wish, but that's not an option at my theater :(
[3:02:48] <Jaghatai> Reflexes of a God
[3:02:50] <marvel877> he got shot
[3:02:50] <TheNewJapanGuy> Cats is apparently some fetish fan-fiction type shit
[3:02:52] <fairore> @niney_who you've eaten what?!
[3:02:55] <%Niney_Who> Alligator
[3:02:55] <%Jekado> not many american's will eat nato or balut
[3:02:56] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat I feel like if regular enemies had a chance to poison you when they bit you would justify having blue herbs, because theyrre just useless otherwise
[3:03:01] <%dekkitout> @Remery_ Oddly enough, soul food's origins can be traced in some cases to when slaves would essentially cobble together dishes form left overs
[3:03:01] <extradopeness> Rice and tomato gravy is great
[3:03:11] <Country_Girl__> @SharkMissile From what I've seen, Pat usually thanks subs/cheers and reads the messages either during a break or at the end of the stream. :-)
[3:03:14] <%dukenux> those "flowers" apatWhat
[3:03:17] <%Ipsenscastle> is tomato gravy different to tomato sauce?
[3:03:36] <%InugamiTheHound> americans don't eat blood sausage. Only the British!!
[3:03:36] <%Jekado> i assume
[3:03:39] <%dukenux> i assume tomato gravy includes tomatoes and gravy
[3:03:44] <%Gogogolem> The dankest kush.
[3:03:47] <+Remery_> @dekkitout does the soul needs chitlins?
[3:03:49] <%Niney_Who> Yeah you say Americans eat anything
[3:03:51] <%grimm_hatter> re2make is really good
[3:03:52] <%Niney_Who> the British eats Blood budding
[3:03:52] <%Jekado> pork's blood is tasty if made well tho
[3:03:55] <logan224312> blood sausage sounds gross
[3:03:56] <%Niney_Who> *pudding
[3:03:57] <%Archer2150> You know people talk about how anime cat girls would be amazing but then they see the movie cats
[3:03:59] <%Alpha8087> The fuck is blood pudding
[3:04:00] <%dekkitout> In a way, yes
[3:04:00] <McAngrimStein> toes and gravy
[3:04:01] <Mexrage> hope the defense boost still there on RE3, it would have been so helpful on the original RE3, because of how unreliable is to avoid getting hit by nemesis
[3:04:03] <%RedSharkHC> not killing the moth?
[3:04:03] <%radda343> blood sausage is fucking disgusting and the british are monsters for eating it
[3:04:06] <+Remery_> the blood of a pig is nice
[3:04:08] <%dukenux> All the Europe has their own version of blood pudding
[3:04:09] <%Ipsenscastle> Never tried blood sausage - I've had black pudding, it's weirdly perfume tasting
[3:04:10] <%Niney_Who> Blood pudding looks like black ichor made into sausages
[3:04:12] <%dukenux> It's good
[3:04:14] <%BayowolfTerra> you're the expert
[3:04:15] <%Typhaeon> I'll take a good blood pudding too
[3:04:19] <lethallylactic> YOU
[3:04:19] <+Nomicro4u> U
[3:04:20] <+Shadicara> Blood sausage is a very aquired taste. Not my cup of tea personally
[3:04:23] <kazadog> blood sausage is great
[3:04:24] <$Dakuu75> @AngriestPat you're not making any mistakes. That's why chat is talking about Biscuits and gravy.

[3:08:59] <+Shadicara> Now he is Liquid X Kappa
[3:09:00] <+Nomicro4u> CHEATED ON CLAIRE
[3:09:00] <%Jekado> Leon is infected with the Y virus, stands for Yellow
[3:09:00] <%BayowolfTerra> Leon is saving himself for Ada. Chris doesn't approve.
[3:09:01] <%OkamiDude15> he's still alive woolieMIRIN
[3:09:03] <Goldteddy> Nothing better than to come outta a hot steaming bath, Right Mr X?
[3:09:04] <$Dakuu75> dundundun-dundun... dundundun-dundun
[3:09:05] <%InugamiTheHound> IMO RE ORC is not that bad of the game. They could done better with the controls
[3:09:13] <SleepyMaribo> Who is Sherry?
[3:09:13] <fairore> @jekado omg
[3:09:15] <@StridentSong> Aww man I just got here, could you start over from the beginning?
[3:09:15] <vascillia> I've seen multiple reviews of RE2/remake where idiots think Super Mr X is Birkin /facepalm
[3:09:16] <ohgodscorpions> it kinda looks like a hulk hand with claws
[3:09:18] <blackened61986> Those are some electrical effects and a fucking half.
[3:09:19] <cureneckbeard> WHO'S SHERRY
[3:09:19] <17sevens> at what fucking point do you go "maybe the g virus isn't worth all this?"
[3:09:22] <%Gogogolem> Oh good my backup bitch is alive great.
[3:09:22] <+CaptainJax> he met sherry once
[3:09:24] <%dukenux> Leon got taste of Ava first, he'll never fuck Claire now.
[3:09:24] <%weissguard> WHY is SHERRY?
[3:09:24] <+Nomicro4u> HELLO?!?!
[3:09:25] <derap41> Nah Leon is to nice to ask such rude questions
[3:09:26] <+Swaggamanca> CONTINUE THE REDFIELD LINE LEOOOOON
[3:09:27] <+Dingalow> Okay, final smash idea for Leon. Ada goes "Leon, use this!" then he blows away the opponent with the rocket launcher
[3:09:28] <%RedSharkHC> Sherry Wait
[3:09:29] <%ElenaManetta> She's a little girl, short, brown hair
[3:09:29] <Skadisson> naroDX RE characters never answering the "where are you" questions

[3:09:35] <Kenny_Riot> He has no idea that was sherry
[3:09:36] <+REDtheBEAST> Here comes the Superior form of Mr.X,the one they should have remade.
[3:09:38] <+SlumberMan> I love that Leon in the remake has a look of "Who the fuck is this kid?" when he gets on the train.
[3:09:38] <+keyoray> Sherry is wine, probably thought she wanted to get drunk at the Apocalypse
[3:09:39] <Tracazoid> "Nobody listens to me."-Leon

[3:24:48] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat The secret ending in RE:Outbreak always implied that something survived the Raccoon City nuke. I always thought it was Birkin, but nothing ever came of it
[3:24:49] <vulkans2> it's so primus

[3:24:51] <+SlumberMan> Nemesis is the same way. Jill shooting him doesn't stop him, but it keeps him down to get nuked.

[3:24:56] <iWBstovetop> Then they proceed to NOT take out umbrella.

[3:24:56] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[3:24:56] <Skadisson> :) I made that.
[3:24:57] <%Hasmeister96> The fact that you keep saying that it took a nuke to kill Birkin makes me confused that they even bothered to make other viruses
[3:24:58] <%jessedouglas> HE SAID IT!

[3:25:11] <rcw_official> SourPls
[3:25:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> And they never did takeout umbrella, but they did find themselves
[3:25:14] <+keyoray> Birkin needed friends
[3:25:14] <+CaptainJax> And then Leon wrote a dumb nerd paper that got Umbrella in trouble
[3:25:15] <%theodolitejones> so many people died!
[3:25:18] <%theodolitejones> so many!
[3:25:18] <hassanico2> @Hasmeister96 other viruses incorporate G but more controllable
