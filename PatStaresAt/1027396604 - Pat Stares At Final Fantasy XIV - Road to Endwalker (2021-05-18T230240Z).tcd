[0:11:49] <+InternetShis> Big shame, fully understandable
[0:11:49] <%walternatorz> "a slog"
[0:11:51] <mr_saturday93> What about the new content?
[0:11:53] <%king_wragles> @BigNaturalMan59 Did you know? Meticulous sourdough is just thorough bread!
[0:11:55] <%baka_sugoi> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[0:11:57] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT THESE ANTI GENOCIDE COWARDS
[0:11:58] <%Meidolaon> There's some shit near the back end I hear
[0:11:59] <%Maids4lyfe> aw
[0:12:01] <cardamomo88> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:12:03] <%patriotrenegade> why what happened
[0:12:04] <Daniel_Is_I> The new stuff is great but it's also the same fucking game outside of that
[0:12:08] <bob900000> would you recommend it to someone who hasn't played it?
[0:12:13] <ricotez> I'm finally here for a Pat FFXIV stream
[0:12:15] <T_Sasquatch> I just finished Ending B and it realy is not worth replaying through it , its fucking unnecesary
[0:12:21] <Tomschiii> route b is such a boring slog
[0:12:24] <%valriot> Its hard to play Nier Replicant 5-6 times, especially when its an obtuse game
[0:12:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @Patstaresat the 2nd half is MUCH better and faster than the 1st half
[0:12:29] <terramagus> 3.14159
[0:12:37] <%Dementedpenguin> Yeah, everytime I see someone stream Nier, it always looks like an endurance
[0:12:39] <+evbites> E is great
[0:12:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @prettygoodatstuff thanks dood. I feed him and help him get around. my mother said the same thing you did.
[0:12:41] <%BoxNavy> you should at least youtube the new stuff
[0:12:52] <%SvenHolgersson> RIP
[0:12:53] <%ssjklyco> There's more than enough content  on the 2nd run.
[0:12:54] <+ultimatehentai00> Still better than the original Drakengard lollllllllllllll.
[0:13:01] <%real_life_ghost> just wait for clemps to cover it.
[0:13:02] <%Monkeyweed21> there's new stuff in part 2
[0:13:04] <cardamomo88> then we will discuss end E?
[0:13:04] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think it'd be fair to just play it on your own at that point just to get there
[0:13:06] <+rafaelba93> new stuff is neat tho
[0:13:07] <@SSaryn> just do it 5head
[0:13:07] <Giothegame> Isn't there new stuff after the time skip though??
[0:13:10] <tanarath> Gotta suffer for your art, Pat.
[0:13:12] <T_Sasquatch> theres no point of youtubing it when I OWN it , i have to play it on my own LUL
[0:13:15] <+evbites> just d ending d instead of e
[0:13:20] <%linSP> Replicant is so janky to play and enjoy with all the artificial fluff injected
[0:13:21] <Ghostbusttyler> Dude, I'm like 17 hours in on my first run and I already feel comepltely wiped from it
[0:13:22] <%sick_kickflips> prettygoodatstuff gifted a Tier 1 sub to TurtlesAndTentacles! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[0:13:23] <jman13131313> why not load a save of end game?
[0:13:28] <%AzureGale> Yeaaaaaah swords and quests yeaaaaaaah
[0:13:32] <Tomschiii> heard one needs to get all weapons for route c ?
[0:13:37] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:13:38] <leinadtonu> i love that part!
[0:13:39] <%JoshManVGH> The games are also CONCENTRATED melancholy. And like... The Times make that harder to take for hobby fun times.
[0:13:39] <genmypoweralready> Oh noooo
[0:13:43] <LordOfThePoultry> oof
[0:13:44] <Nupinoop296> f
[0:13:45] <bob900000> damn
[0:13:45] <%sick_kickflips> hope that helps brother :) @turtlesandtentacles
[0:13:47] <%thetunnelhomer> Would Papa Nier have helped?
[0:13:47] <Daniel_Is_I> That's not a good stream energy
[0:13:48] <%Valdorick> Behind the Streamer: Pat
[0:13:49] <%real_life_ghost> just leave it for clemps. I'll watch his video as I'm in the same boat.
[0:13:53] <cardamomo88> lest just watch the ending E
[0:13:56] <+rafaelba93> new ending tho
[0:13:59] <%ConLin_Arts_> @Tomschiii yeah, it is not that hard
[0:13:59] <%patriotrenegade> Mama mia, here we go again
[0:13:59] <%bugz_munny> They're also suffering porn, that is a good point
[0:14:01] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:14:06] <T_Sasquatch> you dont just need to get 33 weapons, You also have to replay ending b AGAIN
[0:14:10] <%Bmrandfriends> i told u i spent 2 hours getting 10 hoat hides
[0:14:11] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> If I were in those shoes, I would just go off and play it off stream, then bug Woolie about the full thing on the podcast sooner
[0:14:19] <%AzureGale> TOPIC PIVOT
[0:14:22] <%Bmrandfriends> goat hides
[0:14:31] <+GundamF91> Automata's strength really is the playable character being different for each Playthrough, Replicant is just too much of the same
[0:14:34] <%JoshManVGH> WedGagement Ring
[0:14:37] <Tomschiii> @conlin_arts_ how. they all cost billions of money that i dont have
[0:14:40] <%AzureGale> Whoa, refocus
[0:14:40] <%SvenHolgersson> The real question is how hot is Pat's Bunny Boi gunna be
[0:14:52] <%Fenrisulfr_V> That's the good shit
[0:14:54] <+Swerto> No pat, because you sleep like a goblin
[0:14:55] <%ConLin_Arts_> just do every quest
[0:14:55] <%SaiyanShoto> That's funny I have the opposite reaction with Nier and Disco. I get excited when I start Nier then have to force myself to play Disco
[0:14:56] <%emperordread> Nothin beats that first fart of the day
[0:14:59] <Ghostbusttyler> Atleast you get new weapons to use in the 2nd half
[0:15:00] <%ConLin_Arts_> and fish a bit
[0:15:04] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I hate when I get to that point and realize I have to get up and get something
[0:15:04] <%jackythefrost> Its the apollo justice thing!
[0:15:10] <Tomschiii> @t_sasquatch oh god no

[0:15:32] <%linSP> fuck route c, i just reloaded my save to get ending d save myself another playthrough
[0:15:32] <terramagus> That's why you gotta cut off the finger if you lose it, and pretend a bear attacked you
[0:15:34] <aeonicvector> they also get the right your one of your kidneys regardless of compatability
[0:15:34] <T_Sasquatch> you dont just need to get 33 weapons, You also have to replay ending b AGAIN
[0:15:34] <bob900000> is this based of experience?
[0:15:35] <Profmcstevie> You go back to a toad and the magic fades
[0:15:37] <+ultimatehentai00> What if she loses it first.
[0:15:38] <%solracc25> Ring means you made it.
[0:15:39] <%sick_kickflips> @bigdumbeak like she doesn't already
[0:15:43] <Tracazoid> Surprised you don't have a "who will lose the ring first" bet with Paige, like your shit yourselves bet
[0:15:43] <+fartpolice> OR HUSBAND
[0:15:46] <+chiazam> WHO WILL LOSE IT FIRST!?!?!?!

[0:16:49] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Well it is reset so might as well
[0:16:51] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the last time u did this it sold me on the game so this should be fun
[0:16:52] <%justcallmebobplease> Here's a question - what FF9 stuff is in 14?  Anything besides Summons?
[0:16:52] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> my FFXIV streams have all been just grinding out the Moogle Tomes since the fanfest started it all over again, got my Great Ringa already lol
[0:16:53] <+patriotrenegade> What, no "Bulletstomr"? Afraid pf the dick-tits?
[0:16:53] <%AzureGale> Good point
[0:16:53] <mr_saturday93> I don't know how pat deals with Paige always adding Uh to her words.
[0:16:53] <%sick_kickflips> but we're all stupid
[0:16:55] <+InternetShis> No, that would be incredible

[0:38:17] <%depotagents> what's wrong with crystal... (crystal native)
[0:38:18] <+jau_twitch> new character
[0:38:18] <%bugz_munny> if you need a story refresher?
[0:38:20] <heartlesshealer> "WHY???" > Crystal > "Oh
[0:38:20] <ashuckel> lvl 30 is 5% of the journey
[0:38:21] <%MisterRockett> MisterRockett subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! There's a theory that Yoshi P totally caused the gender split controversy on purpose because Square said he could only add one more race but he wanted to add both. Makes sense that he wouldn't feel bad about squeezing more money out of them.
[0:38:23] <%MrMegaJackpots> early quests suck tho
[0:38:25] <%GelatinBoi> 30-ish is where I bounced off the first time
[0:38:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Crystal is fine, Pat is just a weenie.
[0:38:27] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think having one friend to go through with from the start would be nice to start over, 30 IS in fact nothing
[0:38:31] <metalsiren31> Come to Primal, we have cookies
[0:38:32] <digitalbooklet> you can just redo the first 30 in like no time now due to msq cuts and exp buffs
[0:38:32] <%Frost_Quill> Crystal is fine but if you wanna play with your friends make a new character.
[0:38:33] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:38:36] <ammobasket> it'll go fast with the rebalance
[0:38:38] <+PMAvers> Depends how much you value your time? If you don't want to replay that content, you can transfer to somewhere less awful.
[0:38:39] <+OmegaWeltall> New friends?! DansGame ewwww
[0:38:41] <vapidq> im anti social tho
[0:38:41] <%bugz_munny> BUT HOW
[0:38:42] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah but making new friends is hard
[0:38:42] <MarvelousMrD> new account use that free trial
[0:38:44] <@SpaceCapnCrone> shucks
[0:38:44] <@CreepyPorpoise> shut up :C
[0:38:44] <$Ziegsy> Pat, will you be my friend?
[0:38:46] <$RealThiele> man fan fest this year was an emotional roller coaster
[0:38:47] <%patriotrenegade> but how
[0:38:47] <xxshadowxx416> 2 year burn why
[0:38:48] <+makouzer> @PatStaresAt any idea what you want to play since you don't care about playing nier anymore?
[0:38:48] <%DruSM157> I don't care if all my friends are on Aether, i've been on Ultros since 2014 and I'll be buried in that dumb server
[0:38:48] <Finaldragoon> friends haha what are those BibleThump
[0:38:48] <karovus> making friends is hard tho
[0:38:49] <+ChaosedStar> i have no friends TvT
[0:38:49] <skyentombment> And Suzy!
[0:38:53] <%Frost_Quill> ALSO free trial.
[0:38:53] <%Canorius> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwww
[0:38:54] <CriticKitten> How make friends
[0:38:55] <T_Sasquatch> but i dont llike people !!
[0:38:58] <InXplotch> It's ok to play on crystal, it's really not a big deal what data center you're on unless you have want to play with specific people
[0:39:00] <@CreepyPorpoise> he's all mushy ew
[0:39:02] <@SSaryn> You should all play FFXI together
[0:39:02] <%Axellogic> i leik food
[0:39:02] <heartlesshealer> Crystal is fine if you make your friends inside the game rather than play with friends you have from before FF14
[0:39:04] <+ChaosedStar> How make
[0:39:07] <%depotagents> tbh just make a new character. you dont need to buy a server transfer, youll be back where you were in another three hours on a new character
[0:39:07] <InXplotch> real cool pat
[0:39:07] <+Shoosler> anyone play on Aether - Jenova ?
[0:39:08] <@BigNaturalMan59> :3
[0:39:09] <@StridentSong> Shut up SSaryn
[0:39:11] <%BoxNavy> im not even friends with the people in my fc moon2W

[0:39:21] <+Club_Sodar> just be urself
[0:39:21] <Reap14> Community finder is a decent way to find an FC
[0:39:24] <+TheAntitype> I have a character on Aether, Primal and Crystal, but they were made well before DC travel was announced.
[0:39:27] <+Hoonbaba_Woods> give out chocolates to pretty ladies, lots of friends
[0:39:28] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> No be LAME so that way the friends know what they may be getting into
[0:39:29] <oadf_threestrikes> I'm on primal, because my friends are there
[0:39:30] <metalsiren31> Throw up a PF for friends
[0:39:31] <%pilgrimsayswhat> psaUp
[0:39:31] <$RealThiele> CSB FC
[0:39:33] <metalsiren31> Works every time
[0:39:33] <collapsedVigil> Just use the community finder an join a small-ish FC
[0:39:33] <+seoliart> Crystal has a lot of RPers and the clearance rate for higher end content is low, but it's not really a big deal if you don't care about that.
[0:39:38] <collapsedVigil> You'll make friends
[0:39:39] <Guardiansaiyan> MEMES
[0:39:39] <%Axellogic> feed me food i become friend

[0:58:02] <%shurtal> gief Warrior, or Paladin?
[0:58:02] <%depotagents> haven't been very tempted to make a catboy but... the bunny boys? SO tempting
[0:58:07] <ChungusQuest> well, consider his role models
[0:58:07] <collapsedVigil> I wish no company had any conviction with single-gender races, cause they're dumb
[0:58:09] <%jamox1> Gief has big buffs
[0:58:09] <+CookieCutter007> I don't either FeelsBadMan
[0:58:09] <@PeachSaliva> Other cats don't know what Elmo is
[0:58:10] <%bugz_munny> Are catbois going to see a resurgence of "coolness"?

[0:58:59] <SomersaultJustice> do the voices yourself
[0:59:00] <%Valdorick> That's not true Paige, our big boy cat meows and purs at Elmo when he's on screen. And when he's not on screen, he meows, asking where elmo is.
[0:59:00] <%i_chevalier> @daxalog a tired healer class support pet.

[1:18:27] <%jamox1> Pat when are you going to activate your Borutogan?
[1:18:30] <%Takreth> Takreth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! So while playing ffxiv, I realized that the ninjas teleport is actually just a dash. Would you say that they are instead just moving really fast? Just some food for thought, thanks for the great streams.
[1:18:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> hmmm quite
[1:18:35] <%NitronStreams> I think if you can make your phones default text size bigger it will carry over to the twitch chat

[1:19:06] <%the22cstomp> to run
[1:19:17] <neptious> Thats only good for controller
[1:19:22] <%ssjklyco> Optimal controls
[1:19:27] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> and more importantly you can spin jump
[1:19:32] <SaltyAzteca> significant difference

[1:19:38] <xxshadowxx416> just zoom
[1:19:40] <%radregice> i can only play legacy on mouse and keyboard
[1:19:40] <+anovertmoose> I use that camera on Keyboard and it's great
[1:19:42] <+Shoosler> it's  literally the same as every other month it's  fine if you're used to that

[1:20:24] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Wait 12
[1:20:25] <@StridentSong> I want to get off Mr. Taro's wild ride
[1:20:26] <%jamox1> Woolie got us on that
[1:20:26] <%zepherl> you can strafe with Q and E so there's no point using standard on keyboard
[1:20:27] <%CalderGaming> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:20:27] <A_Red_Robot> WAIT, 12 more weeklies or 6 more weeklies?
[1:20:28] <%ShawnTK_> @Valdorick Most likely
[1:20:29] <%GelatinBoi> 12 more weekly lore pads
[1:20:30] <collapsedVigil> Patch 6.0: 6 more Nier Quests
[1:20:30] <+SpaceHobo55> cant wait to not read 6 more
[1:20:31] <+makouzer> @PatStaresAt the camera turns if you strafe on m&k with the legacy camera, it sucks
[1:20:32] <2DSuperiority> I want off Taro's wild ride
[1:20:35] <AoiRob> yoko taro's wild ride never ends
[1:20:35] <Mattais88> Six months is a long time with nothing new, got to fill it somehow
[1:20:35] <Explodincatz> PET US
[1:20:36] <TheFramedWarlock> Time to read the datamined spoilers LUL
[1:20:37] <metalsiren31> Awww yeah more reasons to log in 15 minutes a week
[1:20:38] <Veserados> Are the nier quests limited time?
[1:20:40] <+Calek> @Frost_Quill I do believe this is week 5
[1:20:41] <@StridentSong> *The ride never end*
[1:20:42] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt If you have ANY EXPERIENCE with MMO movement outside this game, you literally cannot use Legecy. It fucks both your strafing and turning. Walking backwards is the only good thing
[1:20:42] <%MrUnKnownAlien> We just hit 6
[1:20:43] <+projectmanatees> Woollen will return to the first
[1:20:43] <Zeldrick> So 12 more weeks of Nier quests?
[1:20:44] <+InternetShis> Fwomp
[1:20:45] <%Phayzeout> I tried to play this a few years ago but I got to lvl20 and combat felt super slow.
[1:20:45] <%thedankestmeeme> hey pat is there a way to see if someone is using my email for ff14?
[1:20:47] <%psidefx> cuteness
[1:20:48] <SpookyMooks> he flompin
[1:20:49] <SaltyAzteca> Wonder if you'll be able to fight that one dude
[1:20:50] <%i_chevalier> @patstaresat When Monster hunter?
[1:20:51] <HeroToxiko> taro never stops never stopping
[1:20:53] <%PMAvers> Pat, if you want a nice chat monitor for a extra screen, I like this one: *** Cuts out a lot of the crap with the regular one for readability's sake.
[1:20:58] <%psidefx> Some never will
[1:21:00] <WakeUpThrow> MOtherfucker sneezed at you
[1:21:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @Veserados no but whenever you do it will take you 12 weeks to finish
[1:21:15] <%jamox1> @patstaresat have you beaten RISE yet?
[1:21:28] <%i_chevalier> Monster hunter When.
[1:21:29] <pmmori> I just came by to sneeze on you again
[1:21:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GOOD FF14
[1:21:30] <%Aeoneth> Yay Pat's doing a Newbie guide,  just in time for me since I just started
[1:21:33] <tranquilturnip> ff14 just hates second window
[1:21:33] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GOOD ON YOU
[1:21:35] <Veserados> @Monkeyweed21 ooo just curious cause it's one of the reasons I want to start playing it
[1:21:38] <%ssjklyco> A tablet would be a good idea if FF XIV keeps doing the bug
[1:21:39] <+SpaceHobo55> going to be actually shocked if there is something really good at the end
[1:21:46] <%MrUnKnownAlien> Yea
[1:21:49] <%Tman451> Do you have Windows Game Mode on? That causes weird throttles sometimes
[1:21:50] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PatStaresAt out of curiousity, are you using the built-in OBS Twitch chat or going to Twitch directly for the chat? I might have found possible solutions you can try later?
[1:21:52] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YES IT S
[1:21:52] <%Frost_Quill> There IS a newbie guide already.
[1:21:54] <+makouzer> @PatStaresAt what are you hoping to see for lvl90 abilities in endwalker? Personally I want to see alot more situational abilities
[1:21:54] <tranquilturnip> aren't ther elike 3
[1:21:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @Veserados it will be around forever
[1:21:56] <tranquilturnip> by you
[1:21:57] <KingVantq> he already did that stream
[1:21:59] <TheFramedWarlock> Yh tablet might be a good idea but it's expensive for just one game
[1:21:59] <%the38bandit> anyway of getting rid of random controller disconnects on pc?
[1:22:00] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt are you using borderless?
[1:22:04] <+goney> windows g
