[0:07:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt I'm really surprised Paige didn't wanna go big and strong with Demon's Souls. She should raise her stats just enough to use the Long Sword. Damage type is super important in DeS compared to DaS. At least the the x-1 worlds, one weapon of each type would be useful. The Winged Spear (pierce) in 1-1, Kilij (slash) in 4-1, and Mace (blunt) in 5-1 vendor. Even at base level they'll do more damage against their respective enemies with each weakness. You get what I'm saying, right?
[0:08:28] <SomersaultJustice> I thought pat hates this game because it's not hollow knight or something
[0:08:30] <%DianaTheAscian> Does anyone know how Paige's Demon's souls stream went?

[0:21:37] <%cartakus> Neither did paige
[0:21:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt Did she order glasses like she said she would?
[0:21:55] <%argavus> That dog used to be smol
[0:22:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> What did you just say?
[0:22:01] <%MonsterEnvy> I barely remember yesterday's events

[0:22:10] <%ChrisPlaysThing> All of it, out of necessity
[0:22:11] <%VashyronM> too many
[0:22:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> A decent amount. I do simple work. Solar installation
[0:22:13] <%rosysyntax> memory is overrated, forget life, play games
[0:22:15] <%InternetShis> If a customer is an asshole, a long time
[0:22:15] <+TheAmazingNick> Do you remember your friend Woolie? the guy with the dreads. You used to play games together
[0:22:15] <ExpressNode> For me a lot surprisingy
[0:22:21] <%argavus> Everything
[0:22:21] <whatsittoya> Yes
[0:22:26] <%barrakuta371> maybe 20% at most
[0:22:26] <SomersaultJustice> that happens a lot
[0:22:27] <%StephanieSadGirl> I remember all of that actually...
[0:22:27] <zodiark26> how many bread have you eaten in your life?
[0:22:28] <+ALazo> you go "who are you?"
[0:22:30] <%Ne1son> I have to remember quite a bit at my job

[0:22:35] <notgarza> Remember every number
[0:22:35] <%McSoliace> honestly i might
[0:22:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> To me be fair, i'm a freak beast like tim rodgers
[0:22:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'd have a vague recollection at least
[0:22:37] <Frostydough1> Pog Arm chair doctors in chat
[0:22:37] <@ssjklyco> "Remember that customer who was an asshole"  Me: Which one
[0:22:38] <Estuko> I've had classmates try to call back to me and I've never seen or met them before because it was like 10+ years ago
[0:22:39] <%D00msDayDan> just have an eidetic memory 4head
[0:22:40] <%strakillias> I work in an sccounting firm and people fucking do that
[0:22:40] <marvel877> @TheAmazingNick Woolie does not exist
[0:22:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> anyone in chat remember being an infant?
[0:22:43] <+ripcrispy> It's sad, but as a Cyber Security engineer I have to remember information like that all the time.
[0:22:45] <%InternetShis> Depends on how much it affects me personally
[0:22:45] <%argavus> yeah super
[0:22:46] <Paltheos> Depends on how big of a problem it was. (Notoriety is the difference-maker)
[0:22:48] <SomersaultJustice> "sir this is a wendys"
[0:22:48] <%Dakuu75> @zodiark26 lots of breads
[0:22:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I *can't* forget

[0:23:02] <+rasend0ri> For the millionth time Pat, you don‚Äôt have a REAL job
[0:23:03] <+zal_silverfang> Pat goes away for 6 months and returns home to Paige "WHO ARE YOU WOMAN???"
[0:23:10] <%MonsterEnvy> Everyone what happened at 1 6 days ago.
[0:23:10] <%Complete_Phased> @PatStaresAt your talk on the podcast last week got me to reinstall Nioh 2 and its been exactly what I needed to get out of the Endwalker hole
[0:23:12] <chimeraxmachina> I sometimes will forget entire clients I‚Äôve worked on just two weeks previously. It‚Äôs mad
[0:23:15] <+Weeewer> Pat is a Pat fan? Figures.
[0:23:21] <@ssjklyco> " I said I would do what to supermans mouth?"
[0:23:22] <%D00msDayDan> exhibit B: detroit 2nd gig and you guys making all the same jokes

[0:23:26] <+takotoots> LUL
[0:23:27] <HoldBtoRun> I've rewatched recorded things I've done and thought of the same jokes I made. Hilarious
[0:23:27] <%Monkeyweed21> reading twitch chat is giving Pat early Alzheimers
[0:23:30] <%Logoth_> and very loud
[0:23:30] <%cartakus> I wish I had Tim memory without the debuffs
[0:23:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> - SAID NO ONE EVER

[0:23:41] <AMDBR9S> i sometimes forget what i did the whole day when i go to bed
[0:23:43] <RushUnplugged> Pat has no objects permanence, like small babies

[0:24:14] <lloyddboy> PAST PAT STOLE MY JOKE
[0:24:15] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaWhat
[0:24:18] <%DashXero> Doesn't that mean you're super consistent, though?
[0:24:19] <+Cynicalto> one time I walked into a movie watched the entire movie and when I left the theater I forgot literally everything about the movie including the name. Kinda freaked me out
[0:24:22] <%Archmortal> THAT'S REALLY GOOD
[0:24:23] <Treasure_Vault> That's consistent quality
[0:24:26] <%coward_man> past Pat almost as intelligent as current pat
[0:24:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat is deterministic
[0:24:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt SURCOME TO THE LOGOS PAT
[0:24:29] <TheOtherLen> [crazy talk]
[0:24:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> The deterministic nightmare
[0:24:32] <%cartakus> forever stuck in time
[0:24:34] <stranger59> Do that Bladerunner test on Pat
[0:24:34] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Is that Crazy Talk Requiem?
[0:24:34] <Paltheos> Here's the real question though: Have you ever said something and then watched footage of yourself saying *the exact opposite*?
[0:24:35] <%Complete_Phased> Im going to need an example?
[0:24:40] <SivSarcast> I sometimes type Discord messages which I already typed 2 years ago, so now I just link those messages instead.
[0:24:41] <+takotoots> consistent
[0:24:43] <OldManDeckardCain> future pat just respects the script
[0:24:45] <+ATorL> You're just internally consistent
[0:24:50] <$Ziegsy> pat is proof of the simulation
[0:24:52] <+TheAmazingNick> Your dice rolls have been determined before you were born
[0:24:55] <%argavus> Patbot 9000
[0:25:05] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat Internalizes the Anti-Life Equation At
[0:25:08] <@GeneralSCPatton> Father whats-his-face would be proud of you following The Law.
[0:25:09] <%Logoth_> Dont forget Mighty No. 9
[0:25:09] <Paltheos> That makes sense.
[0:25:13] <%vivaldiva> The planets align every year pat!
[0:25:16] <@ssjklyco> "Play fallout 76, the new game from Bethesda "
[0:25:17] <Mottyrob> Pat's Personal Character Growth Arc comes later on.
[0:25:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> dead game?
[0:25:22] <blewbeary> input gets output
[0:25:23] <%cartakus> "I'm nothing if consistent"
[0:25:32] <%Dakuu75> sometimes I get a respone to a youtube comment or tweet from liker 5+ years ago... and I'm jsut like, "Fuck, past-me shouldn't of said that."
[0:25:39] <Anthrozzz> hey is the pupper?
[0:25:42] <Anthrozzz> how*
[0:25:43] <+mace210> <3
[0:25:45] <%Supermonaman> David Cage is much more of a hack.
[0:25:57] <RushUnplugged> you gained eternal amounts of trust after apologizing for even just hyping up MN9
[0:25:59] <%ElkRiverDog> To be fair that one got a lot of us
[0:26:02] <%coward_man> someone get Pat to do the Turing Test, we gotta find out if he's a replicant
[0:26:04] <%Dakuu75> oooooohhh nooooooo~

[0:26:17] <%Logoth_> Its fine
[0:26:17] <%Dakuu75> Might-guilt
[0:26:18] <%MonsterEnvy> I had fun with it, but it was not great.
[0:26:19] <@ssjklyco> I remember Woolie talking about how the video for the kickstarter made him sad
[0:26:20] <%coward_man> got your commupence like an anime fan on prom night psaDab
[0:26:21] <lloyddboy> did you ever refund anybody for mn9
[0:26:23] <Estuko> @PatStaresAt Yeah, make those guys cry like an anime fan on prom night :]
[0:26:24] <stranger59> Oh, we should not look back at all that pre-Mighty No 9 talk
[0:26:28] <%MonsterEnvy> Mega Man 11 was great at least.
[0:26:33] <%Logoth_> That was great
[0:26:35] <%D00msDayDan> GOD, ANTHEM
[0:26:35] <commanderapathy> what was wrong with MN9 again?
[0:26:37] <+mace210> dont remind me
[0:26:38] <%PocketBearIllustrator> like an anime fan on prom night
[0:26:38] <Tracazoid> Can't always call if a game is going to be shit or not, meanwhile you're playing the Castlevania-like that didn't fuck up completely
[0:26:40] <%Dakuu75> ALL LIES
[0:26:42] <%rosysyntax> @ReallyBigRocks stay strong, we will live in the stars
[0:26:43] <+rasend0ri> Lol
[0:26:45] <+Mechanized82> why bloodstained? is this a goblin
[0:26:46] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:26:47] <%Dakuu75> Killzone 2 trailer
[0:26:47] <JDlightside> Better than nothing I suppose...
[0:26:49] <TheOtherLen> it looked good up until that stanky 3d model of Beck and then it was over
[0:26:49] <SivSarcast> Anthem had that rehearsed voice chat shiet the Division did.
[0:26:50] <+rasend0ri> We all do
[0:26:52] <+TheAmazingNick> I felt the same haha. "That flying is absolute bullshit"
[0:26:55] <+KumaPrime> is that a Bazelgeuse shirt?
[0:26:56] <+NecDW4> I remember Pat being LEGIT horribly upset on the podcast because he blamed himself for other people losing their money to M#9
[0:26:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> It was KILLZONE 2 LEVEL
[0:27:00] <%cartakus> "That looked like shit"
[0:27:00] <%Dakuu75> lol
[0:27:01] <%cvp5127> now woolie is also dead inside
[0:27:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> @rosysyntax one day lmao
[0:27:03] <%Dakuu75> poor baby
[0:27:03] <RushUnplugged> how can Woolie not recognize a giant bullshot trailer lol
[0:27:03] <%Archmortal> how does Woolie think he DOESN'T KNOW in that situation, HE KNOWS
[0:27:06] <%MonsterEnvy> @commanderapathy It was a 6 instead of a 9.
[0:27:07] <@ssjklyco> Woolies doing that to Reggie now
[0:27:16] <stranger59> It LOOKED cool, as a fake game
[0:27:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @kumaprime its our favorite B52
[0:27:17] <bob900000> was that the one with fake people playing
[0:27:18] <%Dakuu75> he was so pure and naive back there
[0:27:18] <%Logoth_> lol
[0:27:27] <%DashXero> Imagine having to ingest feces to know not to ingest feces...
[0:27:32] <+Catpurnicus> anthem killed his love of the jetpack
[0:27:33] <%DianaTheAscian> and Reggie will do that to somebody someday
[0:27:34] <%abuelabeula> abuelabeula subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:27:35] <%mikehuntis4timmy> the optimism dwindles with age
[0:27:37] <%Monkeyweed21> I wish Anthem's movement was in a good video game
[0:27:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> It literally could've just been the flying mechanics and I would've played hours and hours
[0:27:41] <Anthrozzz> i have no faith in video games lol i wait till they come out if i like them
[0:27:41] <%PocketBearIllustrator> yeah, best not to use concept art to promote your game
[0:27:43] <%Logoth_> Time is a circle
[0:27:45] <artoflec> i guess im always just right about what I choose to get into elaBased
[0:27:49] <%brisk_dacat> Reggie will never lose optimism
[0:27:59] <+PrimalDweeb> Experience is king, for the most part. LUL
[0:28:02] <%DashXero> Give him a year or two.
[0:28:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I'm suprised pat is awake
[0:28:07] <TheOtherLen> give it a few years
[0:28:07] <+Catpurnicus> he is jubilant
[0:28:09] <%AgniBrandt> That statement will age poorly
[0:28:11] <Paltheos> @Anthrozzz I still have faith, but it's in many fewer things lol
[0:28:11] <commanderapathy> @patstaresat I spent 60 bucks on anthem because of my dumbass friend
[0:28:12] <%emperordread> Reggie is a good boy woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[0:28:13] <%Valdorick> A pessimist is just an optimist with experience.
[0:28:13] <+mace210> and if there is no one ur the one whose full of shit
[0:28:13] <%Djinnazz> Reggie saw the trailer of SH1 and thought the cutscenes were what the game would look like.
[0:28:15] <Arqartur0> I think Bloodborne might...
[0:28:16] <%mikehuntis4timmy> isnt he yall age
[0:28:16] <%cartakus> He is a golden boi
[0:28:16] <%Archmortal> @brisk_dacat idk, those Dokapon playthroughs...
[0:28:19] <Treasure_Vault> Reggie gains optimism from food, he's unstoppable
[0:28:20] <%Tacgnol66> I'm surprise I'M awake.
[0:28:21] <$Emperor_Machinus> I keep expectations low to be able to be surprised when proven wrong
[0:28:23] <%xemnahort> @brisk_dacat ds2 shrine of Amana will break him
[0:28:34] <TheOtherLen> you've a heard of gold, dont let them take it from you
[0:28:36] <Mattais88> just a few more Dokapon runs...
[0:28:41] <+Mechanized82> is Reggie 30 yet? that's the deadline when the turn happens
[0:28:42] <SivSarcast> Then you have the reverse case i.e Infinite Warfare being different in a good way, but got backlash for being too different.
[0:28:45] <+mace210> wut

[0:28:49] <C0nKeR> LUL
[0:28:50] <%Dakuu75> oopsie
[0:28:51] <%Monkeyweed21> you know Reggie loses his optimism when he switches back to French
[0:28:52] <JDlightside> it's sad, because I and probably a few other people wanted that game to at least become good.
[0:28:57] <%dalmek> you probably made a joke about NFTs years prior to their existence

[0:30:37] <%greasypete00> [C R A Z Y  T A L K]
[0:30:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> I wonder what actual use cases NFTs will have, surely there'll be something
[0:30:38] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:30:44] <%DashXero> Watching other people eat shit before making a move is the best.
[0:30:45] <%Monkeyweed21> "one of our major shareholders became a cryptobro and if we say no outright he'll sell his shares and crash the stock price"
[0:30:54] <+Mechanized82> they could just make nft gachas. combine all the trash together
[0:30:59] <yukichocomilk> that sounds realistic LUL
[0:31:00] <bullprophet> this might just be a "yeah we're gonna see if ubisoft quartz blows up or not before making a move lol"
[0:31:00] <+xen0riddley> wait, you'd bet money dollars?  Real or fake moneydollars?
[0:31:00] <+PrimalDweeb> ...Fuck that guy.
[0:31:02] <+mace210> and theyre waiting for that guy to forget
[0:31:04] <%AncelDeLambert> a guy as dumb as that can't be trusted, let him pull, then
[0:31:06] <Arqartur0> Talking with my brother about it, he thinks that Crypto will collapse.
[0:31:06] <+Catpurnicus> its like that futurama episode where the entire mine is run by a single australian miner
[0:31:09] <%cartakus> Fuck off dude
[0:31:09] <%Arsenic_8> hopeful thinking, but possible
[0:31:10] <Rionxgarland> itll go down like the titanic
[0:31:12] <%greasypete00> are stupid
[0:31:15] <%Logoth_> are the lowest form of life
[0:31:17] <tanarath> Just Lie.
[0:31:17] <+twohitgood> you're being very generous there for someone who was just talking about being more cynical.
[0:31:19] <%InternetShis> Square made Final Fantasy 7 and now this, so it's a gun to their heads
[0:31:20] <%cartakus> And burn
[0:31:21] <@commanderclaw> Get ready for the Kingdom Hearts NFT game that will have lore you need to know for Kingdom Hearts 4
[0:31:23] <Anthrozzz> lets make a NFT of Pat
[0:31:23] <SivSarcast> Shareholders, the ultimate One Guys.
[0:31:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Shareholder Primacy is dumb as fuck, fuck shareholders
[0:31:25] <%rosysyntax> @ReallyBigRocks NFTs? Use cases? lolololol
[0:31:26] <%xemnahort> Nft=New Frontier Trash
[0:31:26] <%Archmortal> bullying the company you invested in into crypto to try and make back your losses with crypto
[0:31:27] <californaya> I just got 2 Genshin ads when loading stream, is that a sign

[0:31:30] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[0:31:30] <%dalmek> lol
[0:31:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> "earned" lol
[0:31:40] <yukichocomilk> or you were born into money
[0:31:44] <+Arek_1> What kind of kid must that dumbass shareholder have been in their youth?
[0:31:44] <%floornine> NFT idea: make an Nft of someone else‚Äôs kid so you can legally own them
[0:31:45] <Arqartur0> With every great Fortune is a Great Crime.
[0:31:51] <stranger59> Like Elon earned those blood emeralds from his daddy
[0:31:52] <+mace210> earned it fair and square Kappa
[0:31:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> let's not talk about stolen artwork being sold as NFTs, JFC.
[0:31:55] <%mikehuntis4timmy> its basically gambling
[0:31:56] <Anthrozzz> touch my camera through the fence pat
[0:31:56] <Daskolin> Rich people are trust fund babies. And are dumb asf
[0:31:59] <%Monkeyweed21> kudos to Phil Spencer for calling NFTs a scam
[0:32:01] <SunjammerIV> go read anything elon musk has said ever
[0:32:06] <%DianaTheAscian> I remember Iwata's screaming matches with share holders
[0:32:06] <%cartakus> Blood diamond mines had nothing to do with it
[0:32:09] <%Valdorick> "What if we just buy the stocks on bond!?"
[0:32:11] <%Hamborgini> just look at all the big investors that got duped by theranos
[0:32:12] <%Archmortal> shareholders can't even fucking get out of bed without a god damn instruction manual
[0:32:12] <%Logoth_> "Can we charge people to make mario jump higher"
[0:32:17] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Rich people can't be dumb cause theyre rich pat Kappa

[0:32:27] <Gray_LoFi> So the Yakuza 7 minigame wasn't an exaggeration?
[0:32:31] <$ItsRatman> "Nintendo, I think you should expand into hard drugs."
[0:32:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> fucking lmao
[0:32:33] <%cartakus> Why not
[0:32:34] <%InternetShis> And then they did that
[0:32:39] <+xen0riddley> Keanu Reeves also laughed at the idea of NFT's
[0:32:40] <bob900000> what!?
[0:32:40] <draca23> Never forget the Producer who kept begging for a giant robo spider in a movie
[0:32:53] <%DashXero> Yup
[0:32:55] <%mikehuntis4timmy> true
[0:32:55] <Treasure_Vault> You have to be criminally dumb to be rich
[0:32:58] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the big thing is that shareholders don't give a fuck about the company and want money as fast as possible even if the company crashes and burns right after
[0:32:59] <%rosysyntax> CORRECT TAKE
[0:33:00] <lloyddboy> wasn't there a guy in the 1800s who was a huge fuckin idiot but got insanely lucky off joke business advice?
[0:33:10] <bullprophet> rich people don't need survival instincts, they got money
[0:33:10] <%Archmortal> why learn anything when money
[0:33:10] <%cartakus> Don't need to learn shit
[0:33:12] <@commanderclaw> I honestly find that the smartest people tend to be the people who *made* the rich person their money
[0:33:12] <%holydeviant1> They can ignore evolutionary pressure entirely
[0:33:13] <Arqartur0> like your memory about streams
[0:33:15] <+mace210> LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS US PRESIDENT
[0:33:19] <SunjammerIV> peter thiel :D
[0:33:20] <BoneofMalkav> Oh you should hear shit nurses hear from shareholders of hospitals say. Some of those people baffle me how they have any money what so ever. They sometimes ask nurses to literally break the law.
[0:33:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> What do you mean I'm wrong? I can just pay to be right!
[0:33:22] <+NecDW4> On a related note, Dont Look Up was fantastic.
[0:33:23] <Estuko> How much does a banana cost? $10?
[0:33:23] <+mace210> FOR EXAMPLE
[0:33:28] <%holydeviant1> Oh god that's horrifying
[0:33:30] <%VictorVonLouche> Like a speeding ticket is just a pass to break the speed limit to them.
[0:33:31] <%brisk_dacat> You can pay to make problems disappear
[0:33:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> "Why even allow your brain-state to have a correlation with reality when you could just money tho?"
[0:33:37] <commanderapathy> rich people are some of the dumbest motherfuckers

[0:33:42] <%rosysyntax> "Screw the rules, I have money" - Kaiba
[0:33:44] <%miabyte> ahoy Pat
[0:33:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> People just have sign blindness
[0:33:48] <%DashXero> The only thing that can threaten rich people are people who can't be bought.
[0:33:53] <+Gamblor69> Customers are bastards
[0:33:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> rich people just don't live on the same plane of reality as normal people
[0:33:54] <%holydeviant1> That being said, I've run into people who literally cannot count, Pat
[0:33:57] <%Supermonaman> I have no expectations for media I watch so I'm happier if I love or like it and much less disappointed if I don't. Although thankfully I haven't lost my optimism that media can be good/great. Cheer500
[0:33:58] <KeiPrime> retail is hell
[0:34:02] <Arqartur0> @GeneralSCPatton Also, we need to money the money for MORE money!
[0:34:04] <+black_pariah> those people in NY who treat parking tickets as fees and not punitive fines
[0:34:09] <+Arek_1> Shareholders don't care about the company just like HR doesn't care about employees.
[0:34:10] <%DianaTheAscian> who was human
[0:34:15] <ValkahRoctsteel> That sounds like a typical day working retail
[0:34:15] <%MidnightPacif1c> coupons have 1st grade legalese lol
[0:34:16] <%emperordread> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:34:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> like putting rules on a sign is the number 1 way to guarantee people won't follow them
[0:34:22] <%holydeviant1> IT'S A HUGE DEAL
[0:34:25] <Estuko> Normal guy :)
[0:34:26] <tanarath> 'Why aren't to solving my problems & thanking me for existing, Slave?'
[0:34:26] <%AncelDeLambert> no that's a big deal
[0:34:29] <+BignanasTheGawd> woolieONEGUY
[0:34:30] <%cartakus> Finished Arcane?
[0:34:33] <%Logoth_> Rich people will pay huge money for you to fix BASIC ASS COMPUTER PROBLEMS
[0:34:34] <@ssjklyco> He's probably worked your kind of job and knew
[0:34:34] <%coward_man> those customers are THE BEST
[0:34:39] <Shwepie> @Dr_DangerPhD This is even worse in America, because shareholders can sue the company for dereliction of duty if the company doesn't try to constantly be more profitable.
[0:34:41] <%DashXero> Smash cut to that guy watching television in a hotdog suit.
[0:34:42] <+twohitgood> that sounds like a big deal when ever other person is probably a raging piece of shit trying to scam free stuff despite being wealthy.
[0:34:43] <intestinal_bleeding> my apples!
[0:34:46] <Paltheos> I can't say I've encountered that. The worst I encountered in my brief stint in retail is this one real racist POS who gave my senior trouble for no good reason.
[0:34:54] <@commanderclaw> Lawyers are like Professors, they're very useful in a very narrow set of circumstances
[0:34:57] <%walternatorz> I imagine he worked retail at some point
[0:35:04] <Treasure_Vault> He was like their accountant or some shit
[0:35:06] <stranger59> The good ol' tie tug
[0:35:09] <+RobertWayneLewis98> the cool teacher
[0:35:10] <%holydeviant1> It's like a mental switch
[0:35:14] <%PocketBearIllustrator> can we see gief more. I'd like good vibes today
[0:35:14] <fuji_n2> it's super a big deal, it's the calm on the sea, a breathing moment
[0:35:16] <%Jhylla81> i worked at a grocery store and some old lady tried to return a steak that she 'bought last week' that has a sell date of like 6 months ago with a ton of freezer burn
[0:35:18] <EynoStiles> the fact they have money, but cant have there 0.50 cent coupon is expired.
[0:35:18] <ArmadaGeddra> That was proably the token guy from a poor background who worked their way up.
[0:35:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> That man wants to live in the woods and never see another human ever
[0:35:23] <+mace210> @walternatorz oh definitely
[0:35:24] <jowi_time> wooo first stream of the new year!
[0:35:26] <%Archmortal> I hate ties and everything they represent
[0:35:30] <lloyddboy> he was the only one whose brain needed the oxygen
[0:35:33] <+BignanasTheGawd> Little did you know, he was buying those apples to throw them at homeless children
[0:35:34] <%Shikari21> Probably an assistant
[0:35:36] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no that's a bad case
[0:35:39] <TheyCallMeVawn> He sounds like a main character
[0:35:39] <Arqartur0> you know, as a 38 year-old architect... I have to wonder, how these money-bros keep getting dumber, but also getting wealthier!?
[0:35:40] <%StephanieSadGirl> @PocketBearIllustrator Ill second this, can Gief be main screen and pat just talk off screen?  that'd be perfect
[0:35:41] <Sunstalker> It's because he's ana ctual human being who needs to breathe and not a ghoul like his collegues.
[0:35:47] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a BAAAAD case he got thrown
[0:35:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> Enough to acquire some insight
[0:35:51] <fuji_n2> yeah those are wierd
[0:35:54] <draca23> And he would probably get the most shit for the least reason. I have been there...
[0:36:00] <%waltzqueen> Fair
[0:36:00] <%Dakuu75> aawww
[0:36:01] <%floornine> That wasn‚Äôt a lawyer, that was Rodney Dangerfield
[0:36:02] <%Archmortal> this sounds like he might be the only person in the firm that knows how ANYTHING works and has to do everything himself
[0:36:07] <thelonechris> Just quit 4Head
[0:36:08] <%AncelDeLambert> "I'm being forced to represent a total shithead"
[0:36:10] <%PocketBearIllustrator> lemme tell ya, working in retail as an autistic person is like hell on earth for me
[0:36:12] <%Jhylla81> Or some other lady tried to return a 12 pack of diet coke in a type of packaging that hadn't been sold in years
[0:36:13] <%coward_man> yeah he's in that job for money and fuck all else
[0:36:14] <+xen0riddley> you don't KNOW them, but you know them
[0:36:14] <@commanderclaw> Big ass law firms will suck your soul. My Dad had to bail on one cause it was like working for aliens who eat babies
[0:36:14] <%DashXero> Wow. You guys were on the same wavelength.
[0:36:16] <@ssjklyco> And you did

[0:47:49] <Paltheos> Most equity traders are like this, I think, but not all businessmen. Afaik, control of Intel was wrested back into some guy with longer-term vision, and subsequently the share prices plummetted because there was no promise of a short-term return.
[0:47:51] <%Dakuu75> Stadia will be the Stadia killer, dude

[0:49:03] <urkleturtle> it just all goes back to the fact that once you reach a certain company size threshold, the people who are there for the money will outweigh the people who are there for the product
[0:49:04] <%Jhylla81> Blizzard's lawyers calling pat because he made fun of WoW
[0:49:15] <%floornine> @tdotgoat Ghostbusters?

[0:49:34] <fuji_n2> blizzard xhecking if pat has a phone
[0:49:36] <KyberNasse> Roller Beetles alone make Guild Wars 2 better than WoW
[0:49:36] <%Monkeyweed21> GW2 does a bunch of stuff different, which means lots of people dont like it but it also means it maintains a consistent place as #4 in the mmo market
[0:49:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aw

[0:50:13] <%Supermonaman> Adorable. <3
[0:50:15] <commanderapathy> @patstaresat So is NFT one of those things that sounds good on paper but ends up fucking you in the long run?
[0:50:18] <%Puhff> deez nuts
[0:50:19] <%cartakus> WOW
[0:50:21] <%Movemeister> HNY Pat‚Äôs mum
[0:50:26] <@Ranryu692> @Puhff LUL
[0:50:41] <+Hellarussian> brillint
[0:50:43] <%JonathLP> Heh
[0:50:45] <toyforus235> AND ITS MADE BY EA
[0:50:46] <+megaman_sentinel> they would never do something like that oh wait
[0:50:47] <%DianaTheAscian> was that a real thing?
[0:50:50] <+PrincessLuna85> i liked warhammer online FeelsBadMan
[0:50:51] <fuji_n2> it would sell right? Kappa
[0:50:52] <%Monkeyweed21> REMEMBER RIFT
[0:50:53] <%Complete_Phased> That warhammer MMO was really bad
[0:50:54] <Mattais88> But at least it was free
[0:50:56] <%Puhff> :(
[0:50:58] <%SpontaneousC> Age of Reckoning played a ton better than WoW, EA just didnt market it for shit
[0:51:00] <%VashyronM> @DianaTheAscian yes
[0:51:00] <Tracazoid> What did LOTR Online do different? Outside of the license
[0:51:01] <Sunstalker> And then one day we get Amalur
[0:51:02] <Byronic_dreamer> wasn't the pvp okay though?
[0:51:02] <%Monkeyweed21> REMEMBER AION
[0:51:03] <%moonmintparadise> Kingdoms of Amalur ?
[0:51:05] <+Dradugun> it too Total Warhammer to bring that IP back
[0:51:06] <%Ynkubus_> WAR was actually good but didnt have the support
[0:51:06] <KyberNasse> Remember Destiny killers like Anthem? Even Destiny can't kill itself, try as they might. @patstaresat
[0:51:06] <+Kyma1020> There was a video about this on YouTube recently called WoW: Pandora's Box
[0:51:07] <%SpontaneousC> or support it
[0:51:10] <%MechArch> But you love the warhammers tho
[0:51:10] <%Monkeyweed21> REMEMBER WILDSTAR
[0:51:13] <blewbeary> MOBAs
[0:51:14] <ItsAbout9000> Moba boom
[0:51:15] <@Ranryu692> there was a fighting game boom?
[0:51:16] <T_Sasquatch> i wasnt here for the fighit
[0:51:17] <Hoaxfish> remember when warhammer online killed a person
[0:51:17] <scrumbotime> it doesn't have to be good if it sells enough to make them money before they throw it out
[0:51:17] <commanderapathy> cause that's what it sounds like
[0:51:18] <Enthaarungscreme> Makot platformer
[0:51:19] <T_Sasquatch> fgit
[0:51:20] <urkleturtle> wasn't warcraft created due to a blizzard dispute with gw in the first place? kinda like the playstation?
[0:51:21] <Raldavar> Rich people: "Heed him no mind. Thus but the insane ramblings of a madman"
[0:51:22] <%Jhylla81> I played like 10 minutes of the Dungeons & Dragons mmo
[0:51:23] <%InternetShis> Advanced movement boom
[0:51:27] <%JonathLP> The first Warcraft game was suppose to be a Warhammer game, but Blizz couldn't get a license. That led to Games Workshop being much more liberal in licensing the game.
[0:51:29] <%cartakus> horror games boon?
[0:51:29] <T_Sasquatch> i cant type, its okay
[0:51:33] <ExpressNode> Then the boom boom which I'm about to do
[0:51:34] <+hey_an0n> warcraft was going to be a warhammer game but they pulled out
[0:51:34] <%KetsuoTaberu> thank god mobas are over
[0:51:35] <+CherteuseKapibara> HOTS :)
[0:51:36] <anAngryHamster> The fighting game boom only worked cause they were comparatively cheap to make
[0:51:38] <Arqartur0> LoL and Dota only survived
[0:51:39] <@GeneralSCPatton> Because MOBAs suck
[0:51:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> 3 out of 4 failed
[0:51:40] <%coward_man> hero shooter boom
[0:51:42] <TheOtherLen> survival games too
[0:51:42] <Treasure_Vault> I still miss the DC moba
[0:51:42] <%DianaTheAscian> are still in the battle royal boom?
[0:51:43] <+deathscythe1287> @patstaresat we can make a game like Fortnite but more Radical and call it Radical Hights
[0:51:45] <%Puhff> vermintide is really the only proper way to explore the world of Warhammer cuz that places is awful
[0:51:46] <SomersaultJustice> F HOTS
[0:51:48] <MKII> hey hots was decent
[0:51:48] <%Djinnazz> no?
[0:51:49] <+aphotophilic> I remember all the mobil moba clones lol
[0:51:51] <%cvp5127> the gacha boom
[0:51:51] <BoneofMalkav> indie platformers boom?
[0:51:52] <%charp35> No
[0:51:52] <%KetsuoTaberu> nope
[0:51:53] <Enthaarungscreme> Dongguard
[0:51:53] <%MidnightBurst12> no
[0:51:53] <+Dova573> Dawngate was great fuck you EA
[0:51:53] <@commanderclaw> The DC one had some cool alternate world stuff
[0:51:54] <+RobertWayneLewis98> will we get a boom for survival games? :p
[0:51:54] <xmetalicdemon> Who?
[0:51:55] <+Kyma1020> REMEMBER DAWNGATE
[0:51:55] <%JonathLP> I remember the DC moba, it was okay
[0:51:56] <intestinal_bleeding> hahaha yes
[0:51:56] <@ssjklyco> Remember dawn gate
[0:51:56] <%InternetShis> Card game boom
[0:51:58] <TheOtherLen> plague of early access survival crafting games was the worst trend
[0:51:58] <+Tom_Bruise> I hardly remember Heroes of the Storm!
[0:51:58] <intestinal_bleeding> I liked Rook
[0:51:58] <fuji_n2> TERA Online and RO only ate half my lifespan cause they were free* (RO wasn't but private servers)
[0:51:59] <%MidnightPacif1c> they put so much money into heroes esports
[0:51:59] <%Buttlo> All moba players hate every moba except for the one they love to hate.
[0:52:00] <+A0N33> The MOBA market was ALREADY full when the boom started
[0:52:02] <+Captain_Spicy_> Them MOABers
[0:52:03] <%Complete_Phased> Im still mad about Paragon getting shot in the back by Fortnite
[0:52:05] <T_Sasquatch> @CherteuseKapibara i literally only played it for the overwatch skins
[0:52:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >heroes of the storm
[0:52:05] <%Puhff> lol no
[0:52:05] <%Valdorick> Aw man, DEMIGOD
[0:52:06] <%Daxalog> Theyre very high commitment games
[0:52:10] <%Monkeyweed21> the moba one died as soon as Dota 2 and HoTS picked up enough steam to compete with LoL for the top 3 spots
[0:52:12] <KyberNasse> Remember Anthem?
[0:52:13] <urkleturtle> fortnite competed with pubg tho and won
[0:52:19] <%JonathLP> It was a bust
[0:52:22] <%VashyronM> It was like the MMO boom. They tried to kill DOTA and League, which like best of luck
[0:52:24] <%ospreyworks> I rather like Apex
[0:52:27] <@goose_attack_almanac> ARK 2 LETS GOOOOO
[0:52:29] <toyforus235> earthbound indie game boom?
[0:52:32] <T_Sasquatch> @Complete_Phased the devs wanted paragon to die and they did everything in their power to let it die
[0:52:35] <%dalmek> hell, Fortnite used to be a tower defense game and then they saw PUBG and just did it better
[0:52:35] <%ospreyworks> shlooter boom
[0:52:36] <+Captain_Spicy_> I feel like we're on the tail end of Battle Royale boom
[0:52:37] <%DianaTheAscian> the fighting games boom gave use a lot of great series in the end
[0:52:38] <+RobertWayneLewis98> We have the worst games man
[0:52:43] <+victhebeard> copy, paste, dump
[0:52:43] <@ssjklyco> Speaking of, did Rust ever officually release?
[0:52:44] <+WeLucklessJacks> Yeahhhhh.
[0:52:48] <%Daxalog> There were always survival games. They just move them to steam
[0:52:49] <Enthaarungscreme> Most survival games were really the minecraft boom
[0:52:51] <%cartakus> FUCKING STOMPING LANDS
[0:52:51] <$Emperor_Machinus> Was there a live service game boom?
[0:52:52] <%vivaldiva> LUL
[0:52:52] <fuji_n2> LUL
[0:52:55] <Mattais88> There's an ignore games list?
[0:52:57] <Tracazoid> Didn't DayZ's retail take years to, or never caught up to the mod?
[0:52:59] <%Valdorick> ARK ever hit 1.0?
[0:53:01] <%floornine> Have you seen NFT fighting games?
[0:53:03] <@goose_attack_almanac> Careful not to show the 50,000 tiddy games that use every tag to show up fuckin everywhere
[0:53:07] <+megaman_sentinel> yeah bring back pitfighter
[0:53:12] <%MidnightBurst12> early access for almost a decade with almost no progress made
[0:53:17] <Zourath> @Monkeyweed21 Wildstar was the worst one. People were leaving WoW due to WoW catering exclusively to high end raiders at that point. So you'd think they'd cater to the people leaving? Nope, cater to the high end raiders even harder than WoW.
[0:53:20] <xmetalicdemon> people like it
[0:53:20] <BoneofMalkav> Or my personal favorite, Every indie game has their own little reference to Shovel Knight. Don't get me wrong, shovel knight's fantastic. But Not needs to be reference in every indie game ever fantastic.
[0:53:20] <fuji_n2> ARK is big between Vtubers tho
[0:53:21] <KyberNasse> Hentai [Word]
[0:53:23] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Ark is finished, working on Ark 2 now lol
[0:53:24] <+izanagi22> So what inspired coming back to Bloodstained? Sorry if already explained, just got here
[0:53:25] <%Infernal_Dalek> Arcana Heart has finished installing.
[0:53:25] <%cartakus> ARK has a bunch of bullshit now
[0:53:25] <kingra> Huh.
[0:53:27] <ArmadaGeddra> Rust is p gppd
[0:53:30] <%JonathLP> Rust is okay-ish now
[0:53:36] <%JonathLP> ARK is a full blown scam
[0:53:40] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Yeah but who do you here talking about rust?
[0:53:41] <%DianaTheAscian> like years ago
[0:53:43] <%AncelDeLambert> ARK is a 150 fucking gigs
[0:53:44] <fuji_n2> ARK is big, ARK 2 soon
[0:53:45] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Rust console edition got me into it
[0:53:46] <%greasypete00> like 2020 i think
[0:53:48] <+Kyma1020> It's Star Citizen now
[0:53:48] <%kknutson4> 7 days to die has been in alpha for like 8 years
[0:53:50] <Elykial> 7 days to die is on alpha 20 and started early access in 2013
[0:53:52] <%Valdorick> @goose_attack_almanac I don't know about you, but those massive tiddy anime games are infact psychological horror.
[0:53:53] <%Complete_Phased> @T_Sasquatch I remember the week that happened because that Monday they said Fortnite would allow them to help fund other games. And then that Thursday Paragon was cancelled.
[0:53:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @RobertWayneLewis98 Is it tho?
[0:53:56] <lloyddboy> vin diesel early access
[0:53:58] <scrumbotime> ARK is nuts
[0:53:58] <ArmadaGeddra> Rust is a weird game but good
[0:54:01] <TheOtherLen> wonder if it actually left early access or they just slapped 1.0 on it and shipped
[0:54:02] <%rosysyntax> Project Zomboid rules. No point to make, just putting that out there.
[0:54:19] <Zourath> The worst EA survival example is still ATLAS
[0:54:26] <+RobertWayneLewis98> @Monkeyweed21 ohh.... no. still broken as hell, hate to love it
[0:54:27] <Sunstalker> Ark has their pirate spinoff that was such a ripoff a streamer turned all his sponsormoney into giftsubs as an apology.
[0:54:27] <@goose_attack_almanac> @goose_attack_almanac Boy howdy are they
[0:54:31] <KyberNasse> @patstaresat Remember the card games?
[0:54:31] <%Puhff> uh oh
[0:54:32] <+megaman_sentinel> words
[0:54:32] <%ospreyworks> still looking forward to the full, final release of Baldur's Gate 3
[0:54:35] <@goose_attack_almanac> Wait Ark is actually finishedn ow
[0:54:38] <%floornine> Oh god what‚Äôs that one game I keep thinking is Rust? Is it like Blink or Brink? Has a blue cover with a guy shooting
[0:54:47] <Estuko> @rosysyntax seeng the explosion in popularity made me raise my arms in joy
[0:54:54] <@goose_attack_almanac> @floornine brink
[0:54:56] <%Monkeyweed21> The 8th Umbral Cringe Compilation
[0:54:58] <%dalmek> @floornine that sounds like Brink
[0:54:59] <+dawnks> looking  great pat
[0:55:01] <%Complete_Phased> Did Pat ever play Death's Gambit?
[0:55:08] <%floornine> YEAH
[0:55:09] <%greasypete00> good luck
[0:55:12] <%MechArch> Our existence is cringe
[0:55:12] <T_Sasquatch> @Complete_Phased dude i was deep in the paragon community, i still remember cam winston saying that they knew the card system was bad and they still left it in
[0:55:18] <%ospreyworks> yeah, building a pc is easy. getting a gpu aint
[0:55:20] <dredgyboi> Graphics cards nightmarer
[0:55:21] <%rosysyntax> @rosysyntax It is SUCH a good game to play with friends, makes me happy too
[0:55:22] <%athuramn> ATX sizing's really did make life way easier with building a pc
[0:55:22] <Enthaarungscreme> Worst time to build a pc
[0:55:23] <ExpressNode> I built two computers it's pretty easy
[0:55:24] <BoneofMalkav> but good luck getting a good GPU for under 500 bucks
[0:55:26] <@Ranryu692> the only hard part of building a PC is getting all the wires in the right place
[0:55:26] <%Bluwizard21> Get a static guard
[0:55:28] <%charp35> Good luck getting any component
[0:55:30] <%DianaTheAscian> I'm lazy and would just buy something pre built
[0:55:32] <%PocketBearIllustrator> building a PC can be fun if you know what you're doing
[0:55:34] <+victhebeard> let SuperEyePatchWolf know.
[0:55:35] <+megaman_sentinel> Elmo attack

[0:55:39] <%ShogunNoonto> Rust was one of the best ones  I personally like emperium but it's not Super popular
[0:55:41] <%KetsuoTaberu> RAM in the wrong slots, etc etc
[0:55:43] <%Supermonaman> Elmo!
[0:55:43] <KeiPrime> turning it on for the first time
[0:55:44] <@goose_attack_almanac> The inherent struggle of wanting to play Project Zomboid but then I would be suffering in Zomboid regardless of how much I enjoy the game
[0:55:46] <kookaburragangwar> Or forgot to put the back shield
[0:55:48] <Zourath> Shin Megami Tensei, but instead of Law/Chaos, it's Cringe/Based
[0:55:52] <%ospreyworks> don't buy a Dell for the love of god
[0:55:53] <intestinal_bleeding> snapping the CPU into place will give you anxiety fears
[0:55:53] <%floornine> ELMO
[0:55:53] <PirateMike_> What is Post?
[0:55:53] <%StephanieSadGirl> I forgot to plug in the power button and had no idea why it didnt turn on
[0:55:55] <+Catpurnicus> anyone remember the Athlon XP chips where you have to align a giant heatsink on a chip the size of a microsd card
[0:55:58] <%floornine> psaBlep psaPorgmo
[0:55:58] <KyberNasse> Fuck Brink, it gave TF2 the ugly Sniper hat every tryhard uses
[0:55:58] <T_Sasquatch> which is why i will never build a pc on my own, thats too much stress to spend 1000s on
[0:55:58] <+twohitgood> just look up the post error code.
[0:56:00] <+CherteuseKapibara> you'll forget to take off the plastic cover on the cooler and burn your computer down :)
[0:56:06] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @victhebeard yeah, don't ever bother getting a DELL PC.
[0:56:07] <%KetsuoTaberu> @PirateMike_ power on self test
[0:56:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aw fuck
[0:56:12] <+Catpurnicus> and if its tilted just a bit it breaks the corner of the chip off and you just lost $300
[0:56:13] <+re_double> back in the day one could easily reverse usb pins LUL
[0:56:16] <Enthaarungscreme> no modern mobos will show you where the problem is
[0:56:18] <@Ranryu692> that suuuuucks
[0:56:18] <BoneofMalkav> Wow!
[0:56:20] <Paltheos> PepeHands
[0:56:22] <@ssjklyco> Protip: Plug in CPu, RAM  and m.2 before putting into your case.
[0:56:22] <+CherteuseKapibara> gotta update that bios :)
[0:56:23] <%MidnightBurst12> fuck that shit

[0:56:27] <%GinAndRoses> oof
[0:56:31] <%Dr_DangerPhD> worst thing some people will do is to buy parts one at a time over a long period, that can be a disaster when it come times to build
[0:56:34] <PirateMike_> @KetsuoTaberu Ah thanks
[0:56:35] <%Ironbuttz> Happy New Year Pat.  Hope you and the family have a great year.
[0:56:42] <@goose_attack_almanac> #sponsored?
[0:56:42] <%TalisKanju> He
[0:56:43] <%D00msDayDan> and that's why i'm just gonna pay extra for artesian to handle mine
[0:56:44] <commanderapathy> I'm paying someone fuck that
[0:56:44] <%greasypete00> also many motherboards dont include a POST code readout, which can make it hard to actually look at whats wrong
[0:56:46] <SomersaultJustice> use code woolievs
[0:56:47] <%KetsuoTaberu> @PirateMike_ SeemsGood
[0:56:49] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat would you recommend there stuff?
[0:56:51] <%TalisKanju> He's playing Bloodstained again?
[0:56:53] <%AgniBrandt> Artesian builds is SO expensive though
[0:56:54] <%DashXero> Don't forget to use code Woolievs
[0:56:57] <+CherteuseKapibara> remember to use the code wooliewoolz :)
[0:56:58] <%ospreyworks> would recommend staying away from 12th gen intel right now. ddr5 ram is getting scalped to shit
[0:56:59] <+ekodrop> they're hella pricy
[0:57:00] <+kewlmyc> Will you use code "WooieVs"
[0:57:01] <+PrimalDweeb> Could you link it in chat?
[0:57:03] <+Tucker0603> I need a house of my own B4 I get my own artisans builds pc
[0:57:05] <tanarath> Pat, get that sponsorship, though.
[0:57:05] <%cartakus> Giv money
[0:57:06] <+Netgearer22> I bought from BuildRedux...That was on the 10th
[0:57:11] <%AgniBrandt> Like... a whole grand more than I'd pay to build the same thing
[0:57:12] <%TheDullaMAN> Got mine from them and it's good
[0:57:15] <%Valdorick> #SponseredByWoolieVs
[0:57:15] <MonsterGills> ironside computers like Suzy?
[0:57:15] <Shwepie> Use code WoolieVs
[0:57:16] <+izanagi22> I had a year of PC blackouts, I'm buying a premade next time I need a full PC
[0:57:16] <%SpontaneousC> I had mine thrown together by Artesian since they had 3080s at the time and it was the only way to get one, Im pretty happy with it even if it was overpriced
[0:57:16] <Noeleon64> prebuilts can be nice, what little more you pay is put into things like warratny and customer support so
[0:57:18] <@ssjklyco> Yu can stream yourself watching their stream of building you PC
[0:57:21] <+RobertWayneLewis98> @PatStaresAt what kind of tv do you have? oled?
[0:57:21] <+Netgearer22> I'm probably gonna get a refund soon
[0:57:23] <@GeneralSCPatton> The build I got from them was great, and they went above and beyond in terms of customer support
[0:57:29] <RLT917> atpRtsd
[0:57:30] <@goose_attack_almanac> its kinda sad that "It got here and it works" is the best thing we can say about things now
[0:57:38] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:57:50] <%cartakus> oof
[0:57:55] <%ospreyworks> Also, best tip: buy a used GPU off ebay for now. rx 470 and rx 570 are good value for reasonable price
[0:57:59] <%jamsbybetty> @PatStaresAt I got an Artesian Builds PC that didn't work when it got in. Their customer support was dedicated and they shipped it back to their HQ and fixed it.

[1:15:21] <Hoaxfish> how to discover you've drunkenly installed silent hill 2 porn mods
[1:15:28] <BoneofMalkav> You think that's crazy, try installing Deus Ex 1 mods. Some of the install instructions are baffling if your trying to keep your mods in their own folders.
[1:15:36] <%cartakus> Please do sh2
[1:15:37] <tanarath> Somehow...
[1:15:46] <+PrimalDweeb> In some, mysterious way...
[1:15:46] <+re_double> Bloodstained POGGERS
[1:15:49] <%rosysyntax> @BoneofMalkav Malkavian mod for life
[1:15:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's a good thing you keep a legit copy on a hard drive
[1:15:54] <%waltzqueen> @Hoaxfish GOD i can't even imagine how you could add porn to that game without making everything way more disturbing
[1:15:56] <%StephanieSadGirl> How much dop we have to donate to turn this into a Silent hill 2 stream, Pat?  We will do it!
[1:16:05] <SlangPunk> Is the pc versions of SH worth getting if you already own the ps2 versions?
[1:16:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh god
[1:16:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I'm guessing bloodstained set itself on fire ?

[1:16:21] <nomolomo> btw pat beard is looking fly af!
[1:16:25] <@Ranryu692> @SlangPunk not the HD Collection
[1:16:31] <%StephanieSadGirl> @Hoaxfish You just give James the most badoinking badonkers you have ever seen.
[1:16:32] <%waltzqueen> @SlangPunk yeah, the original discs are falling apart. totally worth the back up
[1:16:33] <BoneofMalkav> LUL Here's to hoping for more Malkvian Mod content in 2022 (22?! OH MAN! GOLDBERG!)
[1:16:57] <%rosysyntax> GEP GUN
[1:17:13] <SlangPunk> @waltzqueen oh yeah disc rot is totally a thing, I just mean in terms of which version is the definitive noe
[1:17:17] <%Cityscape17> Just curious, is Nioh 2 worth getting? The christmas sale is still going and im still not 100% about it. I did play nioh 1 as well
[1:17:20] <+TheBitingIrish> NotLikeThis
[1:17:20] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Why dont use something like "total comander" as file manager?
[1:17:20] <+PrincessLuna85> as a tank i have dripping with materia from roulettes
[1:17:27] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm really proud of my hermit tendancies
[1:17:31] <$Hommando> Reaper getting the big nerf
[1:17:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> never got it once
[1:17:36] <%ospreyworks> just a fun aside, boy do I love the internet archive. someone restored the 80s JoJo OVA and it is PRETTY.
[1:17:42] <%InternetShis> DARK KNIGHT NERFED AGAIN
[1:17:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Cityscape17 if you liked 1 then YES
[1:17:48] <dashmatt> on screen
[1:17:48] <@Ranryu692> I hope they don't nerf Warrior before I finish levelling it LUL
[1:17:51] <%waltzqueen> @SlangPunk oh yeah, it's not the HD collection or anything so it's worth having. Especially with Enhanced Edition out
[1:17:51] <%VictorVonLouche> DRK of course getting some form of ability change.
[1:17:51] <%kainhighwind1990> I'm def calling a Warrior nerf
[1:17:56] <%kainhighwind1990> Bloodwhetting too op
[1:17:57] <%JonathLP> Don't nerf PLD. Don't nerf PLD. Don't nerf PLD.
[1:17:57] <%NeroInfinite> War nerf: never ever
[1:18:01] <bullprophet> reaper's gonna get slapped with a hard nerf, it's TOO good for them to leave alone
[1:18:02] <fuji_n2> DARK KNERF INCOMING AGAIN
[1:18:02] <%InternetShis> Monk will take the top spot by virtue of not being touched
[1:18:04] <Danitaras> warrior is just silly right now
[1:18:07] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Please don't nerf WAR, it
[1:18:10] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> it's so fun
[1:18:17] <%Cityscape17> @Cityscape17 more of the same im assuming with some decent changes thrown in?
[1:18:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Reaper needs a nerf for sure
[1:18:23] <%Archmortal> Reaper dps Nerf, Warrior healing Nerf, Sage healing buff, Paladin dps buff
[1:18:27] <%NeroInfinite> War only has two buttons to press FeelsBadMan
[1:18:38] <%InternetShis> Reaper is so fucking good, it'll be the first to go
[1:18:39] <T_Sasquatch> gimme monk buffs, i dont need it but i sure as hell will take it
[1:18:49] <nomolomo> chart stream!
[1:19:07] <%Movemeister> Maybe this chart will be the chart home
[1:19:09] <+izanagi22> Should I hop off for spoilers?
[1:19:13] <%NeroInfinite> reaper is kinda busted
[1:19:18] <+Netgearer22> Sweeeet, SMN getting a buff
[1:19:20] <%Archmortal> dps that give party buffs aren't supposed to be highest dps
[1:19:21] <%InternetShis> Bonkers
[1:19:23] <BoneofMalkav> Know what? Fuck it, replace ALL guns with nerf guns with foam projectiles! There! Now no one can bitch about a character needing a nerf. LUL
[1:19:30] <+SilverDevilfish> Bloodstained: Chart of the DPS
[1:19:30] <%BigCoffee> I have a reaper at 90. They're just super fun to play
[1:19:31] <%Kaask> RIP selfish DPS SAM.
[1:19:33] <%cartakus> Just a lil OP
[1:19:33] <T_Sasquatch> reaper fucks
[1:19:36] <%walternatorz> reaper worst is the same as what I'm assuming the lower quartile as dancer
[1:19:48] <%rosysyntax> lewd
[1:19:49] <%Kaask> i mean dnc was always low
[1:19:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> PHRASING
[1:19:53] <BoneofMalkav> Phrasing LUL
[1:19:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MNK 2ND BAYBEE
[1:19:54] <%waltzqueen> hehehe "bottom"
[1:19:55] <%Master_Van> Wow never thought I‚Äôd see monk up there
[1:19:55] <%BigCoffee> yeah but dancer was always about making someone else SHine
[1:19:56] <%MegadBlitz> what's this chart looking at again?
[1:19:56] <Explodincatz> getting Cata arcane mage dejavu
[1:19:57] <%VictorVonLouche> Wow dancer does not feel weak though.
[1:19:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> sounds kinky
[1:20:00] <T_Sasquatch> bruhhh
[1:20:00] <+superchronicc> the power of dance just isnt enough
[1:20:00] <@GeneralSCPatton> nikkib12Lewd
[1:20:01] <+Netgearer22> TBF, Dancer is a Raid DPS class
[1:20:04] <fuji_n2> hehe
[1:20:06] <%cartakus> Nice
[1:20:10] <Calek> shouldn't machinist be above bard being selfish and all
[1:20:10] <%whyskeywolfe> Hehe, bottom
[1:20:20] <+Kilikan5670> What sight is this?
[1:20:20] <%Valdorick> To be fair, that's because Dancer is giving Reaper that boost.
[1:20:21] <%PlatinumAvacyn> PlatinumAvacyn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:20:23] <%Kaask> oof
[1:20:24] <+Kilikan5670> *site?
[1:20:30] <%BigCoffee> Yeah but dancer makes someone else strong
[1:20:33] <Iwashi94> my boy ninja :'(
[1:20:34] <Danitaras> Sam and Blm should be top in fairness, they are supposed to be cannons, not party buffs, just there to mess shit up
[1:20:34] <T_Sasquatch> fflogs
[1:20:37] <+PrimalDweeb> I thought Summoner would be a bit stronger than that.
[1:20:41] <%InternetShis> Reaper is FAT
[1:20:42] <%kainhighwind1990> I still think WAR will get hit the hardest cause Bloodwhetting too op
[1:20:47] <%Monkeyweed21> summoner could also use a little more
[1:20:50] <%Kaask> rip pld
[1:20:52] <fuji_n2> DARK KNERF
[1:20:54] <%Kaask> couldnt stand at the top forever
[1:20:57] <%Futurecity10> I hate paladin. Cant stand it
[1:20:57] <%kainhighwind1990> @PrimalDweeb ranged dps that can move
[1:20:58] <%NeroInfinite> pal need buff
[1:21:04] <OBS_VinnieK> Honestly shouldn't Reaper Samurai Black Mage and Machinist be top DPS they are all selfish dps
[1:21:04] <bullprophet> paladin's trying its best. it's trying so hard
[1:21:05] <%JohnAtDawn> And Paladin was the Face of Endwalker wtf happened
[1:21:06] <2Bs_USB_port> GNB should be top
[1:21:06] <dredgyboi> jesus that floor on paladin
[1:21:06] <+Bjaldo> PLD needs a buff
[1:21:07] <%BigCoffee> Why is paladin so weak
[1:21:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Clear support
[1:21:09] <%jamsbybetty> PLD is also pretty unkillable
[1:21:10] <2Bs_USB_port> that rotation is HARD
[1:21:12] <%RealThiele> the swords are made of foam
[1:21:16] <%Archmortal> Remember this is Paladin's expansion
[1:21:16] <T_Sasquatch> gnb should be top an
[1:21:18] <%JonathLP> We PLDs are trying our best
[1:21:19] <%Alazull> No nerfs only buffs
[1:21:19] <@Ranryu692> I love PLD, but killing stuff while solo takes forever
[1:21:22] <%jamsbybetty> mascot curse
[1:21:25] <%VictorVonLouche> Wow Sage is busted
[1:21:31] <%StephanieSadGirl> How did we go from Silent Hill 2 to MMO dps charts...
[1:21:37] <ashen_void> reaper gets a party damage buff and party regen
[1:21:38] <%cartakus> Wait now you're fine with drk?
[1:21:40] <BoneofMalkav> NotLikeThis
[1:21:42] <%MegadBlitz> wtf sage
[1:21:42] <Zeif00> yoooo MNK
[1:21:42] <%RealThiele> damn sage
[1:21:47] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[1:21:56] <+superchronicc> is sage a tank class?
[1:21:58] <%Archmortal> DRK's problem isn't its damage, its the self-sustain
[1:22:00] <%BreakfastSampler> sage damage is good if the group knows what they're doing
[1:22:04] <%BreakfastSampler> shit recovery if the group is bad
[1:22:04] <%VictorVonLouche> Whats the healing output is sage the lowest?
[1:22:08] <$SGrim> @StephanieSadGirl Pat's train of thought is multi-track drifting.
[1:22:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> meanwhile me, a WHM, "haha glare go brrr"
[1:22:13] <%VashyronM> @cartakus numerically, DRK is fine. Play wise, it plays like worse WAR
[1:22:15] <%JohnAtDawn> Wait, why does that make sense? Why do Pure healers need to be the lowest?
[1:22:18] <bullprophet> let the healer mains have this one they've suffered enough
[1:22:22] <%jamsbybetty> just throw like 10% potency on all PLD skills and call it good, I'd be happy with that :P
[1:22:25] <%InternetShis> Dark Knight is too weak
[1:22:26] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat what about self healing?
[1:22:26] <%StephanieSadGirl> @StephanieSadGirl It feels like the most cruel pratical joke
[1:22:27] <%Archmortal> @VictorVonLouche by far
[1:22:27] <%MugenSandan> samurai shouldn't be below monk :/
[1:22:28] <%SwdVengeance> Honestly, Sage should be ahead
[1:22:29] <@Ranryu692> wow, my two main classes, PLD and DNC, suck shit for DPS apparentlyLUL
[1:22:30] <%MonsterEnvy> The DPS seem pretty good.
[1:22:30] <%Futurecity10> I love dark knight
[1:22:30] <Cervantas> the two new classes are the best performing in the xpac they are released in? Say it aint so.
[1:22:31] <+ALazo> wish sage would deal less damage and but heal more
[1:22:33] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Do you think they'll nerf bloodwhetting?
[1:22:36] <%Kaask> dark knights the worst MT because it has little self sustain, unlike the other tanks
[1:22:40] <%cartakus> I see
[1:22:40] <+Netgearer22> Summoned buffs plox
[1:22:45] <Danitaras> the fact Drk doesn't have syphon heals is insane
[1:22:45] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> GOOD
[1:22:46] <%SWFanatic> I like pretty colors
[1:22:49] <%ShogunNoonto> Yeah but sage makes up for lack luster heals with the belief you heal with damage
[1:22:51] <%InternetShis> Dark Knight has like 4 CDs and half of them are magic damage
[1:22:51] <%SWFanatic> aw man
[1:23:01] <%NeroInfinite> Wars would RIOT if Blodowhetting got nerfed.
[1:23:06] <commanderapathy> don't nerf reaper plz
[1:23:16] <%MonsterEnvy> Most of the DPS seem in a pretty good place
[1:23:18] <%VictorVonLouche> That unmending improvement skill should move to knocking 30 seconds off of their aoe heal.
[1:23:20] <%RealThiele> just because a WAR is great in fates and dungeons doesnt mean it will be nerfed
[1:23:24] <%Monkeyweed21> DRK literally lower the DPS of the healers by virtue of having worse  sustain and Living Dead
[1:23:28] <+kewlmyc> Yep
[1:23:33] <+PrimalDweeb> They're basically the same.
[1:23:46] <%NYCrownlessKing> then just make dragoon better
[1:23:50] <ashen_void> Dragoon gets to be clunky AND worse dps
[1:23:54] <floatRand> It will get a nerf. Probably reducing potency during Enshroud -RPR
[1:23:55] <%Futurecity10> Good, Dragoon's kinda eh
[1:23:56] <%MugenSandan> it's easier to play than Samurai while doing more DPS too
[1:23:58] <%Akizea> reaper needs a mild touch to make it even with drg
[1:23:59] <%Sterski> But less cool
[1:23:59] <OldManDeckardCain> nah, fuck them showoff dragoons
[1:23:59] <%BigCoffee> just make dragoon less clunky
[1:24:00] <%NYCrownlessKing> also make nin better plz <3
[1:24:01] <@Ranryu692> Dragoons look cooler, at least
[1:24:04] <Cervantas> buffing everyone isn't the answer you have to nerf outliers
[1:24:07] <+Netgearer22> buff summoner!!!
[1:24:07] <%cartakus> Well life is not fair
[1:24:10] <+cascadepersona> As a Dragoon player, yeah, we kinda suck right now, but we feel good to play, so I'm fine
[1:24:11] <+Bjaldo> It also does more damage then the actual selfish dps classes
[1:24:17] <ashen_void> lmao on what planet does dragoon look cooler than reaper
[1:24:19] <Estwilde> reaper has everything. super easy to play, escape movement forward and back
[1:24:19] <%rekinom> Reaper is also MUCH more fun to play for me compared to DRG
[1:24:20] <Forulkan> making every other job better just makes everything easier, better to just nerf reaper
[1:24:20] <+Bjaldo> It's wack
[1:24:21] <%MonsterEnvy> I like Dragoons
[1:24:23] <%kainhighwind1990> I'm getting Wrath DK vibes from reaper
[1:24:23] <%Akizea> reaper is even better than the two classes that are SUPPOSED to be top dps thats not fair if it supposed to be on part with DRG lol
[1:24:24] <%RealThiele> reapers also get to steal drg gear LUL
[1:24:24] <%Futurecity10> Dont nerf reaper, buff Dragoon
[1:24:26] <TheOtherLen> if DRG was way behind like dancer then yeah make DRG better
[1:24:27] <Gregorhasjoined> The NUMBERS don't lie, its kinda substancial
[1:24:28] <%NYCrownlessKing> Ninja's got it worse.
[1:24:31] <%VashyronM> Pat's correct. Reaper is super easy to play and has insanely quick burst windows. It's fine being nerfed.
[1:24:34] <+Toshatron> this isn't SFV Cammy, this is ST Akuma
[1:24:35] <bullprophet> dragoon ain't bad it's just that reaper is WAY WAY better
[1:24:36] <%PlatinumAvacyn> snuffMischief
[1:24:39] <+keiji_maede> @PatStaresAt  What about Rdm, Pat? Do you think Smn needs a buff or no way
[1:24:42] <%cartakus> Make the summons bigger

[1:25:04] <%PlatinumAvacyn> snuffMischief
[1:25:05] <%SwdVengeance> Reaper is like way ahead of Sam and Mnk, which shouldn't be the case to start with. If it's not even in line with those, it needs to be tuned back
[1:25:06] <fuji_n2> ah-vuh-sin

[1:28:48] <@Ranryu692> this was only the second Metroidvania I ever played, so I don't have a ton of reference points, but I loved this game

[1:29:12] <nickynack_> i put in like a month of this game back in the summer. it was so amazing
[1:29:12] <%holydeviant1> There's a part of me that wishes this was spritebased even now, with SNES/PS1 era sprites, but we can't win them all
[1:29:12] <+SilverDevilfish> SingsNote limesDance
[1:29:13] <%floornine> Bloodstained starts at Ritual
[1:29:14] <SunjammerIV> too bad the rest of the soundtrack is army of lovers covers
[1:29:15] <%Buttlo> I hate that every single game defaults to INCREDIBLY OVERLOUD, I have to turn that shit down to like ten percent every time.

[1:29:29] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt did you beat nightmare mode?
[1:29:29] <+re_double> do you have Castlevania Advanced Collection?
[1:29:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> IGAVANIA IS BACK BABEYYY

[1:29:41] <%lord_woodsy> @arqartur0 a very wild ride
[1:29:44] <Arqartur0> @MugenSandan well, the intro fucking slaps, so that is good.
[1:29:45] <%athuramn> maybe 5% lower? it's drowning your voice out a tiny bit @PatStaresAt
[1:29:46] <%cartakus> Diamond is the most light hearth of all jojo

[1:29:52] <%Archmortal> in the words of Tim Rogers, Bloodstained IS the new Castlevania
[1:29:54] <BoneofMalkav> PogChamp

[1:30:05] <+Catpurnicus> the sprite-based bloodstained games are getting up there to rondo quality
[1:30:05] <+ElDragon_1> I recently got the platinum for this game. Loved every minute of it.
[1:30:06] <%RealThiele> classic mode is pain
[1:30:07] <chimeraxmachina> Very pretty orchestration
[1:30:12] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt it also has 2 extra characters

[1:30:18] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Pat, have you considered playing Disco Elysium again?
[1:30:26] <+Catpurnicus> I hope the next 3D bloodstained improves the art style
[1:30:29] <%cartakus> Bass is here?
[1:30:30] <SunjammerIV> it would be easier and cheaper for them to make a sprite game because this was made by a mobile game developer with no experience in complicated 3d platformers and boy were they in over their heads
[1:30:35] <Ultralazuli> still pretty loud
[1:30:35] <+SilverDevilfish> "I'll make my own Castlevania. With Not!Shanoa's and Samurai!" - Iga

[1:32:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> NOPE
[1:32:43] <%cvp5127> time to delete my account
[1:32:47] <+cascadepersona> At least I funded the games I wanted to before I left that platform. Kingdom of the Dump and Eiyuuden.
[1:32:48] <%barrakuta371> Wait Kickstarter is now dabbling into Crypto?! NotLikeThis
[1:32:48] <%LowSkillGod> Pat, what do you mean ENTIRELY?
[1:32:49] <@Ranryu692> so long as Platinum still has to give me the rest of the backer rewards they owe me, I don't care what Kickstarter does
[1:32:49] <Shardlab> Crazy Talk
[1:32:49] <HoldBtoRun> is this one of those April Fools... oh no
[1:32:51] <Lynxystem> pretty sure they actualy doubled down on it
[1:32:53] <%greasypete00> THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
[1:32:53] <+WeLucklessJacks> Yeah, I heard that they were doing that.
[1:32:56] <%athuramn> I'm pretty sure they went even harder
[1:33:00] <%Mendin> Goddamned CAPITALISM caused Dracula
[1:33:01] <Calek> dang it kickstarter
[1:33:01] <DXLelouch24> we need to BULLY THEM
[1:33:02] <%Archmortal> @Archmortal not when the music is just mixed too loudly in general
[1:33:02] <+lumporr> that sounds like fighting games
[1:33:04] <%holydeviant1> @holydeviant1 There's no way that habit is official format, is all I'm sayin'
[1:33:05] <%livlinn> woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG
[1:33:06] <DXLelouch24> BULLY THEM ALL INTO SUBMISSION
[1:33:07] <%SpontaneousC> Its a huge hit for the indie tabletop scene since they pretty much live and die by kickstarter
[1:33:07] <+TheBitingIrish> yike
[1:33:09] <+lumporr> "kickstarter doubles down on blockchain"
[1:33:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Man Kickstarter is being stupid
[1:33:13] <+Catpurnicus> crypto is going to tank the entire tech industry at this rate
[1:33:14] <@ssjklyco> Kickstopper becoming real
[1:33:16] <%MonsterEnvy> They already make free money
[1:33:16] <%cartakus> yay
[1:33:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Man, the video game industry as a whole is wounding my soul. i'm nearing 10 years i nthis shit now

[1:33:18] <%livlinn> I'm deleting my account
[1:33:19] <+re_double> lionDemon4
[1:33:20] <Majestic_Flof> that seems even more impossibleto return money
[1:33:21] <%lilytastic> "what we've heard is that we have to do a better job telling the story of why we're switching to blockchain"
[1:33:24] <anAngryHamster> indiegogo stocks going up
[1:33:25] <urkleturtle> indiegogo is still around i guess?
[1:33:28] <+lumporr> always double down on blockchain before wakeup
[1:33:28] <%LowSkillGod> Wheres good ole Teddy K when you need him?
[1:33:29] <Evendrag> why would you shoot yourself in the foot like that
[1:33:30] <%VictorVonLouche> So rip anyone wanting to kick start anything ever.
[1:33:30] <%Alazull> Oh sweet
[1:33:31] <BoneofMalkav> Dracula but with ALCHEMY LUL
[1:33:33] <+re_double> SHARTBINGERS
[1:33:41] <fuji_n2> SHART
[1:33:42] <+izanagi22> We made Shanoas
[1:33:42] <+FlappySeal_> It's like some of these companies don't actually want money
[1:33:46] <%Cityscape17> gotta love this games music
[1:33:47] <+Kyma1020> Dracula but with Crystals
[1:33:47] <%LowSkillGod> as a treat
[1:33:49] <stranger59> As a treat?
[1:33:51] <@Ranryu692> you could give him a skateboard
[1:33:51] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> "Boy, we sure love experimenting on the youths"
[1:33:52] <%floornine> Woolie should revive Scrublords just to look at NFT fighting games
[1:33:53] <+superchronicc> what if not dracula
[1:33:53] <%KetsuoTaberu> Pat can have a little Dracula as a treat
[1:33:54] <%cartakus> What is a dog?
[1:33:54] <%holydeviant1> They created a SHITLOAD of Draculas, then killed the Draculas in a ritual, but missed a few, somehow
[1:33:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> A little Dracula as a treat
[1:33:56] <TheyCallMeVawn> So they created SMT protags
[1:33:57] <+PrimalDweeb> Yeah, the music is still kinda loud; while the dialog is low.
[1:33:59] <%Pappajimbo> damn those goop jade eggs!!!
[1:34:00] <pixelkenj> is this about marijuana
[1:34:06] <@Ranryu692> @floornine that would be free publicity though
[1:34:07] <%floornine> What if an Alucard
[1:34:15] <DXLelouch24> time for The Age of Piracy Chat, time to crash the industry if need be
[1:34:16] <$Ziegsy> dracula? oh we playing ff14 new raids?
[1:34:16] <+izanagi22> Suddenly James Bond melody
[1:34:17] <DXLelouch24> again
[1:34:17] <lloyddboy> would you say this game is Draca-Lackin'?
[1:34:17] <+NekoDraga> Dialogue is pretty quiet
[1:34:18] <%Logoth_> Who names their son "GEBEL"
[1:34:22] <+SilverDevilfish> The story is basically Legally Distinct Ecclesia
[1:34:24] <%Logoth_> You may as well name your child Eggers
[1:34:34] <Arqartur0> I have to fight off Crypto-bros stealing my photos to make their fucking NFTs, it's fucking horrible.
[1:34:36] <%cartakus> Gabe my boy
[1:34:37] <pixelkenj> gebel is a weebel
[1:34:38] <Vashido22> eh Gebel is alright
[1:34:39] <DSD24> Miriam is also cute
[1:34:40] <SaltyAzteca> Pretty much
[1:34:42] <KeiPrime> wacky alchemists and their not-real names
[1:34:44] <fuji_n2> waht if we made a ton of Alucards and Shanoas and killed them except 2
[1:34:47] <%MonsterEnvy> He's ok
[1:34:47] <Evendrag> Yeah she big Shanoa!
[1:34:49] <%floornine> Gay Bell
[1:34:51] <Vashido22> HE SAID THE THING
[1:34:52] <@Ranryu692> I can't remember what default Miriam looked like
[1:34:52] <SomersaultJustice> HE SAID THE THING
[1:34:56] <kingra> Miriam <3
[1:34:57] <+Plus_On_Black> @pixelkenj exactly
[1:35:00] <%MugenSandan> HE SAY THING
[1:35:02] <+Kyma1020> Gebel is fake Drakula tbh
[1:35:05] <%LowSkillGod> Gebel is okay but his main drawback is that his name is fucking Gebel
[1:35:07] <%Logoth_> Say the line
[1:35:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> I CLAPPED
[1:35:10] <ArmadaGeddra> Gebil is just a lame Richter
[1:35:12] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> did you know the NFT shitty bored apes have their own animated YouTube show now called Red Ape Family? it really is awful
[1:35:14] <%Valdorick> Title Drop, end credits
[1:35:15] <SunjammerIV> gebel is a great boss on nightmare lvl 1 if you deliberately equip the shittiest sword in the game so he doesn't die in 3 seconds

[1:35:49] <%shootbang_exe> did pat say how far into this game he has gotten before?
[1:35:50] <%MonsterEnvy> I think the game is a second behind.
[1:35:51] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I forgot how much i dislike the graphics of this game
[1:35:54] <%floornine> Reminds me of the boat stage in Castlevania Judgment
[1:35:55] <Vashido22> It barely has a story, dont worry about it
[1:35:58] <+Kyma1020> Hey it's the lady that loves Mothman
[1:36:00] <+NecDW4> Dont forget, your kick has a fireball motion, that can be input up to 3 times, and has forward momentum in the air for making jumps you normally wouldnt
[1:36:10] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Speaking of Dracula X, any plans to stream all or parts of the Advance collection?
[1:36:13] <%MonsterEnvy> No wiat it was on me

[1:36:16] <%LowSkillGod> ex-po-si-tion
[1:36:20] <nansex> i wish they would have gone with pixel art
[1:36:21] <SunjammerIV> the moon is unbelievably evil in curse 2
[1:36:21] <%Cityscape17> does he have a, Dark Soul?
[1:36:23] <TheyCallMeVawn> They really shouldve just used portraits for these dialogue scenes.
[1:36:29] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt What is a Kickstarter but a miserable pile of NFTs
[1:36:32] <+Plus_On_Black> @chat Did Pat play Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth yet?
[1:36:33] <enerkaizer> The way they pronounced Johannes hurts me as a German XD"
[1:36:33] <%holydeviant1> @JustTheGuyYouNeed There's something about the models. Like, individually they're all good, and so are the environments... But put together, it looks and feels like a Flash game
[1:36:34] <%MonsterEnvy> The game looks fine I think.

[1:42:27] <%Movemeister> Pat taught this game wrong, as a joke
[1:42:28] <@ssjklyco> You're thinking of Mighty No 9, which never released their DS/Vita  version
[1:42:29] <%StephanieSadGirl> why orb man only read my comments that could come off as mean...?
[1:42:35] <fuji_n2> man the ship ost is my favorite from this game

[1:42:39] <+NekoDraga> Hold Up to Jojo pose
[1:42:45] <%PatchTheSquid> @gan_n_dorf theres alot of direct jojo references in this game.
[1:42:50] <+Fooguwu> @gan_n_dorf You can actually make her do a jojo pose
[1:42:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can jump on that fallen mast
[1:42:54] <%athuramn> ONE GUY STRIKES AGAIN
[1:42:55] <+AlucardX60> You have to do it from the map menu
[1:42:55] <DevilHands_> Open the map screen, than do it
[1:42:58] <+meatmaaan> @gan_n_dorf you can legit make her do jojo poses and the stone mask is a piece of armor lol

[1:43:52] <+Netgearer22> I mean she LITERALLY gets stands, and has a symbol on her body
[1:43:57] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Fun fact most Demons in this game are named after the Demons of the Goetia.

[1:44:35] <@commanderclaw> You can master certain moves, and if you do so, they can unlock more special moves for similar types of weapons
[1:44:35] <%RealThiele> hall wuggin
[1:44:39] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Your special moves have exp, use em more and you'll be able to use them with other weapons of the same type.
[1:44:40] <+meatmaaan> astral chain was pretty good
[1:44:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> GOBLINS ACTIVATED
[1:44:47] <%baronblank> Didn‚Äôt they confirm astral chain sold well enough to get sequels?

[1:45:01] <%Movemeister> That astral chain soundtrack Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:45:02] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat special moves are attached to weapons, but they build mastery experience by hitting enemies with them; mastery lets you use the move on all weapons of that type
[1:45:02] <+meatmaaan> techniques
[1:45:10] <marvel877> in techniques
[1:45:16] <artoflec> i mean Takahisa Taura is a big boy at Platinum now, he's already on his next directed game
[1:45:17] <+twohitgood> the mastery only goes up if you use the attack on an enemy, btw.
[1:45:21] <%MonsterEnvy> If you master one you can use them on all weapons of the same type
[1:45:22] <JDlightside> speaking of platinum, are you still looking forward to Granblue Fantasy Relink despite platinum not really being apart of that game anymore?
[1:45:23] <@GeneralSCPatton> More accurately: Special moves are associated to specific equips, but can be unlocked for other weapons in that class by grinding them
[1:45:25] <%RealThiele> SOUL STEAL
[1:45:25] <%cartakus> The platinum curse is still going strong
[1:45:30] <%Logoth_> Who puts a bookcase in front of a staircase

[1:45:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> bar go up
[1:45:49] <+Catpurnicus> yeah its reasonable at the start
[1:45:51] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt the Cris from Symphony is straight up in this game
[1:45:52] <lloyddboy> a nutcase, that's who
[1:46:00] <%greasypete00> they just get so into it
[1:46:00] <+Catpurnicus> I mean its no simon strut
[1:46:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bookshelves also list techniques as I recall
[1:46:04] <+haitakaa> it's like a forward moonwalk
[1:46:05] <+twohitgood> oh never noticed that return to neutral animation. that's ncie.
[1:46:06] <%cartakus> stop the french stuff
[1:46:07] <%MonsterEnvy> So if you master it you will be able to use that move on all shoes
[1:46:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> Soma Cruz always had the coolest walk
[1:46:10] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, their runs are very flow-y
[1:46:10] <%baka_sugoi> idle animation
[1:46:11] <pixelkenj> so if you wish you can spend a ton of time farming souls, items, food, tech exp

[1:46:24] <SunjammerIV> the flame cannon shard is possibly the most efficient dps move in the game
[1:46:41] <Vashido22> man this makes me want to play this game again
[1:46:42] <+NekoDraga> @SunjammerIV Void Ray?
[1:46:43] <%Mendin> Just the requisite Satan Lounging Couch Room on the galleon
[1:46:44] <+CelioHogane> Mi biggest dissapointing with the other characters in the game that are Miriam is that they just don't use the RPG systems, basically making them feel like... straight up worse.
[1:46:45] <+Catpurnicus> good old crab couch
[1:46:47] <sentaiexpresss> Love the way this game feels to play.
[1:46:47] <%RealThiele> man the portrait skill prior to nerf was OP as hell
[1:46:49] <%kainhighwind1990> @SunjammerIV what about the heretical grinder?
[1:46:49] <Bearheart223> So in what order should one play the bloodstained games?
[1:46:50] <Vashido22> yeah
[1:47:00] <fuji_n2> yup
[1:47:05] <+Dova573> I wish Dead Cells felt anywhere as good as this game does
[1:47:06] <%Dakuu75> safe, so far.
[1:47:06] <Treasure_Vault> No, which kind of safe
[1:47:09] <%RealThiele> erotic violence pachinko defeated
[1:47:13] <+Gohyakuen> is it?
[1:47:17] <solidoutlaw> they have separate canons yeah
[1:47:18] <Tracazoid> Three good games, so Bloodstained has earned its place
[1:47:19] <+izanagi22> In what way? Like the genre's in good hands with Bloodstained?
[1:47:19] <TheeRabbi> I pretend none of the games after SOTN exist and that this is the direct sequel
[1:47:21] <SaltyAzteca> Curse of the Moon has the best OST
[1:47:22] <%cartakus> Castlevania yes, Dracula? no...
[1:47:22] <Vashido22> @Bearheart223 no order, curse and ritual are separate
[1:47:27] <+meatmaaan> place is legit infested with vampires and undead how is that safe? Kappa
[1:47:27] <+CelioHogane> @Bearheart223 This one and the pixel art ones are different timelines, you can play either order.
[1:47:28] <+ElDragon_1> Welcome Company was my most used Shard probably
[1:47:31] <%MonsterEnvy> That is a useful damage move as well
[1:47:38] <SaltyAzteca> Blasphemy Unto Heaven fukken SLAPS
[1:47:39] <%NeroInfinite> Defeating enmies gives you more shards..some more useful than others.
[1:47:40] <artoflec> welcome company is amazing yeah
[1:47:41] <DoomRedMage> Curse of The Moon 2 is super good
[1:47:41] <%MisterRockett> Both Metroid and Castlevania(kinda) are back
[1:47:46] <%jasole37> Dracula is in this game
[1:47:47] <%NopeBadguy> you say that but it's only a matter of time until Castlevania nfts

[1:47:57] <+CelioHogane> @NeroInfinite My favorite thing from Soma.
[1:47:59] <@GeneralSCPatton> Ngl, I am terrible at that hadoken input for the kick, because I don't do fighting games.
[1:48:00] <%RealThiele> Dracula is busy signing deals with squeenix
[1:48:18] <+rednecked__crake> I remember Aris spending half a stream doing that un-deux-trois kick to reach some faraway chest
[1:48:23] <+CelioHogane> It should be both
[1:48:28] <+Catpurnicus> I've always seen after
[1:48:34] <+Catpurnicus> 1234
[1:48:39] <%NopeBadguy> @generalscpatton the inputs in this game are surprisingly strict, especially on follow ups
[1:48:41] <artoflec> that kind of stuff also just has an input buffer that you just need to feel out right?
[1:48:43] <+CelioHogane> Yes, that's why it should be both
[1:48:46] <+CelioHogane> so it's just fucked up
[1:48:51] <fuji_n2> after for me too
[1:48:52] <XionBarzhad> KoF does with and it throws me off bad
[1:48:55] <%andrewofbob> It should be negative edge at same time ONLY
[1:48:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> CLEARLY it should be attack button first then the motion inputs
[1:49:04] <+izanagi22> There's something satisfying about how Castlevania maps fill in
[1:49:08] <%cartakus> Metal slug looking ass aliens
[1:49:12] <ahmz1404> I'm watching in 160p
[1:49:12] <+Catpurnicus> ff6 simplified circle motions so you can just tap the cardinal directions twice instead
[1:49:17] <+meatmaaan> alternate between the two just to fuck with The Gamerz
[1:49:18] <artoflec> yeah kick that CANNON
[1:49:18] <%NeroInfinite> the dragon heads
[1:49:18] <KeiPrime> hodl the attack, do the motion, then release, like primal rage
[1:49:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt btw theres a divekick that has enemy step
[1:49:24] <KeiPrime> HahaBaby
[1:49:27] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt the best part of playing bloodstained is seeing a new enemy and you can inmediately tell wich castlevania enemy it is
[1:49:27] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Which of the classic Castlevanias is your favorite and which of the Metroidvanias?
[1:49:30] <+CelioHogane> In fact, the game should punch you every time you do the imput, you should physically be punished for doing the motion imput.

[1:51:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Because it's Castlevania
[1:51:24] <+izanagi22> I mean you went into a coffin in SotN
[1:51:25] <fuji_n2> idk
[1:51:27] <urkleturtle> and how does this room exist on a ship?
[1:51:28] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Because is cool
[1:51:29] <@commanderclaw> Cause Satan is proud of you, even if you're not proud of yourself
[1:51:29] <%andrewofbob> My headcannon is that the savepoint is in another dimension
[1:51:30] <+NekoDraga> Comfy chairs are not evil
[1:51:30] <SunjammerIV> the save point is a boss
[1:51:30] <+Dova573> ITS COOL EVIL IS FINE
[1:51:31] <@Ranryu692> looks cool
[1:51:33] <+Hellarussian> because good is dumb
[1:51:33] <tanarath> Pat, just give artists money.
[1:51:35] <%TheDullaMAN> Only the Debil can save you from this
[1:51:36] <pixelkenj> castle boat
[1:51:36] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt The save point is a statue of Mephisto.
[1:51:36] <%brisk_dacat> Because it.. BloodStained!!
[1:51:37] <%cartakus> To make you feel safe
[1:51:37] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> An evil boat
[1:51:39] <+CelioHogane> No, the save point IS an evil castle.
[1:51:39] <Treasure_Vault> Evil boat
[1:51:39] <$Ziegsy> evil boat
[1:51:40] <%LowSkillGod> its an evil boat i guess
[1:51:40] <+Joe2187> thats the boss from curse of the moon
[1:51:40] <@PrefectusCorgi> Castle Boat
[1:51:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> THE DEMONS BROUGHT IT
[1:51:43] <Tracazoid> A boat is a pirate's castle
[1:51:44] <%moonmintparadise> no money for custom save rooms for the first section of the game, pat
[1:51:44] <SaltyAzteca> Boatvania Kappa
[1:51:45] <%LowSkillGod> most boats are evil
[1:51:46] <fuji_n2> evil boat then
[1:51:46] <Sunstalker> Pat did prophecise the boat souls
[1:51:47] <Treasure_Vault> Like the titanic. Evil boat.
[1:51:50] <%coward_man> oh god this is the one where you dress up your doll
[1:51:53] <Zeif00> Animated emotes would be pretty cool too
[1:51:55] <%cartakus> hooooo
[1:51:58] <+CelioHogane> ONLY the save point is an evil castle, everywhere else isn't.
[1:51:59] <%orbulon> late game armor changes the chestpiece
[1:51:59] <%NeroInfinite> Scar hat and face mask are the main visual changes iirc.
[1:52:02] <+CelioHogane> DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:52:02] <SunjammerIV> the real question is why does the evil castle have the same demon couch room as the boat
[1:52:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt hit down and a in midair for a divekick iirc
[1:52:07] <+valiard> Dont worry bout the STONE ROOM in the ship
[1:52:10] <+CelioHogane> @orbulon no
[1:52:12] <+izanagi22> I wish this game had transmogs

[1:53:46] <+Fetrigon> bane is based nobully PunOko
[1:53:47] <Raldavar> The Woolie Ring
[1:53:48] <+CelioHogane> @Valentinius_Anodyne And it will be gone probably when they actually release costume DLC.
[1:53:55] <tanarath> Pat, just pay artists to make memes for you if you're too boomer to think of them yourself.

[1:55:16] <+meatmaaan> box jank
[1:55:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> I KNOW
[1:55:23] <%Buzzard42> yeah the whip attack is bad
[1:55:27] <Saltmeisterr> oh man
[1:55:27] <SomersaultJustice> they're probably not allowed to have it the same
[1:55:29] <%TheDullaMAN> Hi Paige
[1:55:30] <urkleturtle> whips kinda suck in this game
[1:55:30] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat they added monkaPat on the discord; you could ask strident for that
[1:55:31] <T_Sasquatch> she is literally being taken advantage of
[1:55:33] <%croxeye> yeah Custom Deliveries!!! Help Kai`shir pimp out his friends XD
[1:55:34] <%moonmintparadise> that was honestly the biggest dissapointment for me too man
[1:55:34] <fuji_n2> yeah... yeeeeeeeah
[1:55:35] <XionBarzhad> the whip is pretty bad
[1:55:35] <Treasure_Vault> Did Pat get the Ring in the far east tall room? I wasn't watching for a minute
[1:55:37] <Zeif00> hay Paige
[1:55:38] <%MonsterEnvy> I like the whip
[1:55:40] <+CelioHogane> There is THE WHIP on classic mode, tho.
[1:55:40] <SaltyAzteca> Cuz its not The whip
[1:55:40] <%Archmortal> New Castlevania, New Whip
[1:55:43] <TravinoEXE> I do wish the whip was better
[1:55:44] <Saltmeisterr> i can't wait to see EEEEEE OOOOOOOO man again
[1:55:44] <Treasure_Vault> Secret wall ring, I mean.
[1:55:49] <+izanagi22> Yes
[1:55:55] <TravinoEXE> there's a better whip later on that kinda rules
[1:55:56] <%NopeBadguy> baby tired
[1:56:14] <+CelioHogane> It makes it stronger.
[1:56:14] <%brisk_dacat> He got so much attention last night. He should be attention fatigue
[1:56:15] <%DEETRz> it gets stronger
[1:56:17] <+meatmaaan> when we gonna get to the real game... the cooking
[1:56:17] <%Movemeister> Good words
[1:56:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Powers it up the more ya get
[1:56:21] <%Movemeister> Strong
[1:56:22] <%TheDullaMAN> More Shard mean More Power
[1:56:25] <+Ilmataria> Grade is damage and rank is something else
[1:56:26] <%Monkeyweed21> duplicates upgrade it
[1:56:28] <Treasure_Vault> Ring in the tall room on the right, secret wall.
[1:56:28] <%NeroInfinite> You can upgrade it later and it'll just bounce of rbasically ever
[1:56:28] <%MonsterEnvy> You get stronger for more shards
[1:56:29] <artoflec> i cant remember the difference between Grade and Rank or whatever
[1:56:32] <Vashido22> GUNS ARE SO MUCH FUN
[1:56:33] <%RyTYoung> @patstaresat have you watched Don't Look Up? that movie is wild
[1:56:33] <+CelioHogane> GUN
[1:56:35] <Saltmeisterr> GUN
[1:56:36] <%cartakus> brittish pat
[1:56:39] <TheOtherLen> rank goes up from usage, grade from duplicate copies iirc
[1:56:39] <%Cityscape17> every  time you pick up the same shard, it increases the grade and increases the damage
[1:56:39] <%orbulon> i love how the marketing was "whip or sword" as if most whips don't suck
[1:56:40] <+RobertWayneLewis98> this looks like a roguelike, is this a roguelike?
[1:56:41] <+meatmaaan> shard faaaaaarm
[1:56:43] <fuji_n2> GUN
[1:56:48] <@Ranryu692> guns are pretty good imo
[1:56:48] <%croxeye> the best martial art, GUN
[1:56:48] <circular7> pat won the game Kappa
[1:56:48] <+NekoDraga> The best weapon in the game is a gun. Shoot bangs are fun
[1:56:49] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Shoot da Dracula with your GUN
[1:56:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Guns are fun
[1:56:51] <%JoshManVGH> G U N
[1:56:51] <TravinoEXE> guns are fucking OP in this game
[1:56:51] <%Cityscape17> rank changes the effect a little bit
[1:56:53] <%andrewofbob> Each shard has different benefits to grade and rank
[1:56:53] <Vashido22> @RobertWayneLewis98 no just a metroidvania
[1:56:55] <%LowSkillGod> gun time
[1:57:02] <%NopeBadguy> guns kinda suck tbh
[1:57:05] <+Catpurnicus> that gun is so busted
[1:57:07] <+CelioHogane> @RobertWayneLewis98 It's a metroidvania, but there will be a roguelike mode.
[1:57:08] <anAngryHamster> Did you ever play those Shaman King GBA games? They're just Castlevania lite
[1:57:09] <%Movemeister> That sounds like it feels nicr
[1:57:11] <+re_double> Castlevania Aria of sorrow had gun

[1:58:01] <Make_me_mad> Order of Ecclesia is maybe the best castlevania. It will NEVER be rereleased.
[1:58:01] <%baka_sugoi> S W O R D
[1:58:02] <+NekoDraga> Now you can use the kicks with any shoe weapon
[1:58:02] <%SWFanatic> Hi Pat
[1:58:05] <+FingaLights> I'm Pat
[1:58:06] <pixelkenj> I love the train part in portait of ruin
[1:58:06] <circular7> i dunno i thought you were matt Kappa
[1:58:07] <SomersaultJustice> is that pat's down air attack in smash
[1:58:09] <%DEETRz> you missed the drop
[1:58:09] <%LowSkillGod> Silent Hill DownPatting
[1:58:11] <%kknutson4> Does Pat know he can spam the roundhouse kick move in the air to get to certain unreachable places?
[1:58:15] <Calek> Order of Ecclesia just used the bottom screen as a map so it's not  big deal
[1:58:17] <%TheDullaMAN> Only certain weapons have certain moves, until you master them.
[1:58:17] <%DEETRz> he dropped his helm
[1:58:18] <+Shadic790> Missed the item drop NotLikeThis
[1:58:19] <+izanagi22> I just want SotN on Switch ffs
[1:58:24] <%NeroInfinite> it's gone now
[1:58:26] <%andrewofbob> Too late; you leave a room, drops are deleted
[1:58:27] <%Buzzard42> Hi pat
[1:58:31] <%DEETRz> its gone now
[1:58:33] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat mastery doesn't unlock new moves; they unlock that move for all weapons of that type
[1:58:36] <pixelkenj> get everything
[1:58:41] <%RealThiele> only part of bloodstained im not a fan of is soul grinding
[1:58:42] <%MonsterEnvy> We may cause the Pachinko industry is going to become much less profitable
[1:58:44] <Treasure_Vault> Secret Ring, East double tall room
[1:58:45] <+meatmaaan> helmet
[1:58:46] <%DEETRz> no he dropped something else that time
[1:58:48] <+CelioHogane> You missed the rarest of loots
[1:58:53] <+CelioHogane> 1% drop chance gone
[1:58:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> They drop 2 mats and their helm
[1:58:59] <DXLelouch24> in the sequel you should just get the move
[1:58:59] <+valiard> Mastering moves adds it to a permanent move list
[1:59:02] <DXLelouch24> FUCK IT
[1:59:03] <+CelioHogane> Same
[1:59:04] <pixelkenj> wheres the dash cancel
[1:59:05] <+TheBitingIrish> Katanas have like, 6
[1:59:07] <%Buzzard42> greatsword moveset is the best one
[1:59:07] <DXLelouch24> go nuts
[1:59:14] <@Ranryu692> guess what? It's broken here, too
[1:59:14] <%baka_sugoi> HELM BREAKER
[1:59:15] <Make_me_mad> Big overhead swing is the best.
[1:59:17] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt oh you gonna LOVE some swords you get then
[1:59:20] <+izanagi22> I can't handle long windups
[1:59:21] <+CelioHogane> Broadswords feel too good
[1:59:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> Claymore for life
[1:59:23] <%cartakus> Dullahammer is a cool name
[1:59:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @JoshManVGH Mostly gimmicky stuff, Dawn of Sorrow and the bonus characters in the latter two would need to be edited to take account of DS gimmicks for a few small things
[1:59:25] <$TheSmerdis> There's a version of that sword with multihit thats NUTS
[1:59:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I love the basilard and other knives, they stab so fast lol
[1:59:31] <@GeneralSCPatton> Claimh Solais
[1:59:33] <+CelioHogane> You can get there now
[1:59:34] <+NekoDraga> The shard from the Dullahans was pretty useful in the early game for me
[1:59:35] <%TheDullaMAN> If you kick late enough, you can make it across
[1:59:36] <+Catpurnicus> you can use the kick to get there
[1:59:37] <SomersaultJustice> you can probably make that with the 3 kicks
[1:59:38] <Saltmeisterr> RAT
[1:59:38] <%MidnightPacif1c> gweedoseva
[1:59:39] <+Ilmataria> You can make that jump with the kicks I think
[1:59:40] <%MonsterEnvy> You can use your Air Kick to get up there
[1:59:43] <lloyddboy> RATS
[1:59:44] <+Catpurnicus> the kick is a triple jump
[1:59:45] <+NecDW4> @PatStaresAt Boots will get you across that gap
[1:59:46] <+CelioHogane> If you use the kicks you can totally reach
[1:59:46] <%NeroInfinite> you can cheese it with the kungfu shoes
[1:59:48] <%NopeBadguy> you can air kick over it
[1:59:49] <%cartakus> This boat is fucking hugh
[1:59:51] <Treasure_Vault> kick up there
[1:59:53] <circular7> if only pat had some kinda triple kick... Kappa
[1:59:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> You can do the un deux trois to sequence break that gap
[1:59:58] <%RealThiele> rats have taken over the ship
[2:00:02] <+valiard> You might be able to make it
[2:00:06] <DXLelouch24> if we can get TWEWY to work we can get the Castlevania DS games to work
[2:00:12] <+FingaLights> Rats on the boat.. Cause they can't swim
[2:00:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> For the time yes
[2:00:15] <quigley_plays> I'm just glad they could fit dracula's casting couch in the boat
[2:00:16] <%orbulon> a boat with multiple stone save rooms
[2:00:21] <%MonsterEnvy> Do remember it takes up MP
[2:00:21] <%NopeBadguy> is this a one off or full playthrough?
[2:00:25] <%RealThiele> chest blind
[2:00:26] <%Buzzard42> @DXLelouch24 TWEWY barely works
[2:00:27] <+Catpurnicus> Pat, isnt it great how this game is teaching you french pronunciation
[2:00:33] <%Buzzard42> Pog

[2:15:48] <+Jaromero435> make something cool
[2:15:49] <Vashido22> nodachi
[2:15:49] <XionBarzhad> Nodachi or Claymore are good starters
[2:15:50] <Top_Lane_Duelist> anything with big number
[2:15:50] <TravinoEXE> I think there might be an in game menu to look at all the icons
[2:15:51] <%TheDullaMAN> Katana has a shitton of Techniques
[2:15:51] <%TheEvilOmega> Just short hop attack.

[2:16:01] <Profmcstevie> Of course you are
[2:16:06] <+NekoDraga> Renee's Requiem is the best weapon when fully upgraded
[2:16:06] <%baka_sugoi> WEEABO SWORD
[2:16:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Katanas get a ton of techniques later on
[2:16:09] <%epide> max the water shard its STUPID good
[2:16:11] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Go down to the bottom of the crafting menu
[2:16:12] <TravinoEXE> I liked the Pelekus a lot at the start
[2:16:15] <%Valdorick> Big swords are big good
[2:16:17] <ZaerichAnakalypton> "I'll go with this" oh man, I've heard that far too many times
[2:16:17] <%bundle_of_herbs> dull blade run
[2:16:25] <%Gogogolem> Honestly all the weapons are equally good.
[2:16:27] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt There are a few extra weapons at the bottom
[2:16:28] <%andrewofbob> Oh boy, I have this on the switch, and that port has framerate drops all over the castle
[2:16:33] <ComfyFox> Do You Understand?
[2:16:34] <+pectusumbra> didn't realize an early start today! So how goes the stream?
[2:16:37] <%Gogogolem> The feet suck though.
[2:16:40] <TheeRabbi> The weapon system in this game is really, really fun. There are some really cool weapons later on that you can make, but I won't spoil. Curious to see how much into the system you dive.
[2:16:41] <Coystick> Weeb swords in western style fantasy hurt me
[2:16:42] <DSD24> Its Numbah 1
[2:16:43] <SparkAfterDark> sharts
[2:16:46] <pixelkenj> farming crafting materials was an ordreal, as expected
[2:16:55] <$Ziegsy> I leave for 20 and we are a pirate. game wild
[2:16:56] <Vashido22> idk if its just me, but I love the cooking system lmao
[2:16:59] <%baka_sugoi> F O O D
[2:17:01] <PanicSwytch> Pat, aside from leveling up, consuming food for the first time also increases stats
[2:17:01] <%RyTYoung> MEAL GIVES STATS
[2:17:02] <+FingaLights> FOOD
[2:17:03] <%TheDullaMAN> Food gives Permanant Buffs
[2:17:03] <%UvBenServed> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[2:17:06] <%RyTYoung> NUMBER GO UP
[2:17:07] <SaltyAzteca> YOU GOTTA EAT RIGHT
[2:17:09] <Vashido22> COUNTAH
[2:17:09] <+izanagi22> Cooking is great in this game
[2:17:10] <%greasypete00> permanent boost too
[2:17:10] <urkleturtle> ah yes alchemy. also known as cooking
[2:17:10] <+Grayhammatter> F O O D
[2:17:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Food gives permanent buffs the first time you try one, is very important
[2:17:11] <+Catpurnicus> Pat, meals give you a permanent stat boost the FIRST time you eat it
[2:17:16] <fuji_n2> the first time u eat it, then it's just hp
[2:17:19] <+sixcubit> PERMANENT stat boost
[2:17:19] <%cooldude69xx> Games always be trying to trick me into eating healthy
[2:17:19] <@ssjklyco> It's permanent, which I didnt relize until later
[2:17:19] <xeroslash1> big parries for big bois
[2:17:22] <%Buzzard42> the hitbox on katanas rule
[2:17:23] <marvel877> Did the last character DLC ever come out yet? They said they'll make the sequel as soon as that DLC is done.
[2:17:26] <%Valdorick> Don't knock meals, they're PERMA stat boosts
[2:17:30] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Oh yeah, Katana won the Sword vs. Whip thing, so I think it's got the most amount of techniques
[2:17:30] <+JustToWatch> are you saying that eating something other than gruel will make you healthier and stronger
[2:17:34] <%MonsterEnvy> I think the katana as a dash attack or something
[2:17:47] <%Cityscape17> the goofy weapons are fucking amazing
[2:17:54] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt You can get the 7 bit coin in like two screens
[2:18:02] <%kainhighwind1990> 8 bit*
[2:18:09] <+Fetrigon> @justtowatch unfortunately woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:18:12] <+HelveticaScenario> Paige sounds exactly like the old woman in this game when she does her elderly voice.
[2:18:14] <SaltyAzteca> LOOK AT THE DISPLAY
[2:18:18] <@StridentSong> Food stat boosts are permanent. So you want to eat everything you can at least once. The stat boost will only happen the first time you eat it, then it's just healing
[2:18:19] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I'm pretty sure one of those goofy weapons is a lightsaber
[2:18:19] <pixelkenj> :)
[2:18:20] <%Akett> This is really making me want to play this game again.
[2:18:21] <%baka_sugoi> PIZZA PogChamp

[2:28:38] <MayShip> extras for crafting i guess
[2:28:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Can craft with those
[2:28:44] <@ssjklyco> You can used one for a quest item
[2:28:47] <+twohitgood> having duplicates of weapons and accessories will be a must for crafting.
[2:28:48] <XionBarzhad> Yeah I found out that if this game gives you multiples, it is probably for crafting or a quest notkohNote
[2:28:48] <%athuramn> "here's 3 rings, mine, my husbands, and one for dominique when she asked to join us"'
[2:28:54] <fuji_n2> she has more quests now
[2:28:56] <SunjammerIV> you can do an incredible amount of hours food and gear crafting in this game

[2:37:02] <+re_double> WOO
[2:37:03] <fuji_n2> nice
[2:37:12] <jorniev> passive shards are necesary
[2:37:13] <fuji_n2> this is actually pog
[2:37:13] <Pigeonsquall> level that shit pat! level it good!
[2:37:15] <%Mendin> He's a big guy, for you
[2:37:32] <%TheDullaMAN> Nope
[2:37:33] <+SargentToughie> No, there's a separate soul for Katana mastery
[2:37:34] <%orbulon> no
[2:37:35] <+justianxix> dont think so
[2:37:37] <+NekoDraga> With the passive shards, if you fully upgrade them with Johannes they become permanently active, even if they are not equipped
[2:37:37] <%andrewofbob> Katanas are not swords, but maces are
[2:37:40] <+pectusumbra> I don't *think* so
[2:37:41] <MacMog> I believe that parry as much as I believe a Tarufell defender
[2:37:44] <+AlucardX60> You can see if you take the shard off
[2:37:46] <+Catpurnicus> kick your way to the chest
[2:37:46] <XionBarzhad> Nope, Katana and swords are separate
[2:37:50] <fuji_n2> different weapon unfortunately
[2:37:51] <%RealThiele> 2H vs 1H
[2:37:57] <+izanagi22> Katanas are a separate class iirc
[2:37:59] <%Valdorick> @andrewofbob hrngh
[2:37:59] <+justianxix> katana are Special swords Kappa
[2:38:01] <%NeroInfinite> No, but big bastard sword and claymors count
[2:38:01] <%JoshManVGH> No, dachis don't count, I guess.
[2:38:08] <MacMog> katanas are better than swords because weeb
[2:38:11] <@Ranryu692> Silver Chariot
[2:38:12] <jorniev> the passive shards are so good because you can also get many

[2:42:50] <Psyramics> they're all available now, you can start hitting them already
[2:42:51] <+izanagi22> God parrying a bat is hilarious
[2:42:52] <%JoshManVGH> Oh hey did he talk about why the Rerun Twitch thing was bad? I fell a sleep so I think I missed some bullshit.
[2:42:53] <@Ranryu692> I feel like there's a sizable core that stay for ~most~ of the stream, and then a few hundred cycle through
[2:43:00] <%Ironbuttz> gathering stream?  that last one was a fun watch
[2:43:03] <Danitaras> node pops 100's of gathers descend from the sky
[2:43:04] <+Grayhammatter> wow, summon many bats
[2:43:09] <Mattais88> I'm grinding MonHUn Rise
[2:43:15] <+boti_balint> summon bat is a great spell
[2:43:18] <+Catpurnicus> you were a worthy adversary, bat #53
[2:43:21] <%TheDullaMAN> NOTE: If you parry, everything that the slash across touches, gets damaged.

[2:43:37] <%CalderGaming> the Up-Bats

[2:43:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yamane doesn't do bad music :)
[2:44:01] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[2:44:03] <%MonsterEnvy> You have to learn them on the weapons listed
[2:44:04] <Azathotic> No you can do them
[2:44:04] <fuji_n2> nah they can come with the weapon
[2:44:05] <%RealThiele> the tower music is Kreygasm
[2:44:13] <%MonsterEnvy> Well one of the weapons listed
[2:44:16] <Das_Beergut> I enjoyed grinding shards more than grinding souls Castlevania; I think it's the visual differences at higher ammounts
[2:44:20] <+boti_balint> CAT
[2:44:21] <+pectusumbra> item to your left from dog
[2:44:23] <+ocelotshotfirst> You can do them on their weapon before you learn the combo by guessing.
[2:44:26] <$Emperor_Machinus> cat painting!
[2:44:27] <%andrewofbob> You don't need the book to start learning, but it helps to not spam various motions on whatever weapons
[2:44:27] <%JoshManVGH> Do the bats... sound like monkeys?
[2:44:28] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat they're attached to weapons, but you can do them as long as you know the input and have the weapon
[2:44:29] <Vashido22> yeah pretty much are curse of the moon enemies are here

[2:44:35] <Saltmeisterr> CAT
[2:44:44] <+Toshatron> you can just do them like SotN if you know them
[2:44:49] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt katanas get more moves than any other weapon if I remember correctly, and almost all of them are winners
[2:44:53] <$Emperor_Machinus> a cat backed this
[2:45:01] <+Catpurnicus> can you turn off kickstarter stuff in the options?
[2:45:03] <+izanagi22> Better backer portraits than usual too
[2:45:06] <Iwashi94> the portraits are backers right?
[2:45:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> mmm, jiice
[2:45:13] <artoflec> mm tomato

[2:45:20] <%RealThiele> blud
[2:45:22] <%UvBenServed> What's that smell?
[2:45:24] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt If you obtain the weapon the technique is listed on you can use it
[2:45:27] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> it's blood!
[2:45:32] <%NeroInfinite> A blood fountain
[2:45:34] <Elykial> hope that isnt chris's blood
[2:45:36] <%MonsterEnvy> If you master it it can be used on all waepons of it's type
[2:45:37] <lKaleidoscopel> bless
[2:45:37] <ExpressNode> Oh yeah I remember the option to change blood color and the fountain can look freaky
[2:45:38] <+Xeno351> some of the spells are so stupid OP tho that you might never use a weapon again
[2:45:40] <+izanagi22> Bless you
[2:45:43] <+terry_quest> gesundheit
[2:45:59] <%NeroInfinite> oh and it's from the werewolf that's been impaled
[2:46:03] <%moonmintparadise> I actually really like it when Portraits are real people, be it Developers in silly costumes or painted versions of Backers. Divinity OS 2 has those too and they are fun
[2:46:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That goddamn Laser Shard is busted as hell later on
[2:46:03] <+boti_balint> oh, just lore
[2:46:03] <$Emperor_Machinus> What's that smell.. Is it blood?! No, its smash players
[2:46:04] <+Grayhammatter> delicious book

[2:48:58] <%floornine> GEBEL STOLE MY MANGA
[2:49:02] <Zeif00> I am... Alive
[2:49:05] <PanicSwytch> Da book
[2:49:08] <%MisterRockett> How much of an asshole do you have to be to go "that's all in the past" to your victim?
[2:49:09] <%rosysyntax> something about the way Alfred phrases things is hilarious
[2:49:22] <+FingaLights> Book horny
[2:49:37] <%Alazull> Now Alfred what if you fucked off and explained
[2:49:41] <+Catpurnicus> it totally is
[2:49:43] <XionBarzhad> Pretty sure that is intentional
[2:49:44] <SparkAfterDark> Gebel pronounced like evil
[2:49:47] <doselfren> I feel that
[2:49:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah ITS GREAT
[2:49:49] <+Catpurnicus> and everyone else talks normally and goes wtf
[2:49:49] <%Jhylla81> His power is maximum
[2:49:50] <Rav3Games> they did a REALLY good job
[2:49:53] <%rosysyntax> English dialogue with japanese coaches?

[2:49:58] <%RealThiele> DIE YOU MONSTER
[2:50:00] <+swid_harry> I need The Book
[2:50:07] <%orbulon> it gets to the point
[2:50:09] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> A functional jank
[2:50:11] <%moonmintparadise> it is in-lore rambling that only the player should understand at once
[2:50:13] <%rosysyntax> Good vibes tho
[2:50:16] <%Shingodzilla009> Shingodzilla009 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey pat happy new year! Looking forward to more pat and Paige content as always!
[2:50:20] <+Toshatron> Stilted
[2:50:23] <%CalderGaming> stilted?
[2:50:25] <+HelveticaScenario> It's supposed to sound old timey, Pat, but just comes off as stilted.
[2:50:27] <WillofGame> It doesn't flow well.
[2:50:29] <%floornine> What‚Äôs the book? It‚Äôs a book
[2:50:29] <Ghufufin> phoenetically pronounced english?
[2:50:34] <+Catpurnicus> its like they recorded half of each sentence separately
[2:50:36] <Treasure_Vault> mad libs?
[2:50:36] <%moonmintparadise> It is phrases that tell you more information that any real conversation would have
[2:50:40] <%Cityscape17> The Book!
[2:50:48] <MacMog> questionably localized by someone trying a bit too hard to write Olde Englishe
[2:50:51] <%MisterRockett> "We have exactly 5 minutes of audio for dialog make this shit count."
[2:50:54] <SparkAfterDark> It's written like someone speeding towards a data storage limit
[2:50:59] <%thebeargoesHONK> that fucking character model.... what did i walk into?
[2:51:05] <%whyskeywolfe> [GRAMMERISM]
[2:51:07] <%Jhylla81> They're talking about The Hungry Caterpillar
[2:51:08] <mczarklesby> It's like only Alfred got run through that process yeah.
[2:51:12] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah I get that
[2:51:12] <mczarklesby> Bold choice.
[2:51:16] <shadoke> It's a result of bending over backwards to avoid the characters actually communicate information that would clear up conflict and make large parts of the drama unneeded
[2:51:17] <pixelkenj> "long time no see"
[2:51:19] <XionBarzhad> Begone Monster, you don't belong in this world.
[2:51:20] <+Catpurnicus> Gee, Bill
[2:51:26] <lloyddboy> BIG DOG SNORE
[2:51:28] <+30k_GST> What is this Stone Mask
[2:51:28] <MacMog> yes, writing English words with a dash of Japanese structure
[2:51:37] <Das_Beergut> "Make no mistake. I won't let anyone touch that tome but me."
[2:51:43] <Raldavar> What do you mean you CAN'T translate a language into another one to one?
[2:51:43] <%Valdorick> BIG save
[2:51:45] <%RealThiele> stone mask is just some stats
[2:51:57] <$Order_of_Mystery> 2020Unroll
[2:51:59] <%Keyd00d> It can't be helped
[2:52:04] <MacMog> from the era when they tried too hard to localize honorifics and accents
[2:52:08] <%Valdorick> Just never turn Blood white in the settings, Pat!
[2:52:15] <+pectusumbra> could always farm it if you wanted
[2:52:20] <Das_Beergut> Alfred would totally say "You SPOONY bard!"
[2:52:21] <%alcors_wisdom> alcors_wisdom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! aye pat you know how this goes, lets see broke the connecting bone to my thumb while boarding which is fine the travel insurance covers it but then yesterday i dropped a boston butt on my middle finger and i think it might be broken as well
[2:52:24] <$Order_of_Mystery> dont you get a pose with stone mask?
[2:52:24] <+SargentToughie> If you wanted, you could pretty easily go farm it. Half my gametime in my playthrough was just running in and out of rooms killing the same dude like 50 times
[2:52:25] <+leviting> "it can't be helped" is hilarious though
[2:52:35] <Vashido22> THE BOY
[2:52:37] <%RealThiele> get that luk stat cranked up for soul farming
[2:52:51] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt When you max level each passive shard, you get their ability without having to equip them
[2:53:07] <pixelkenj> yeaap
[2:53:09] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Yep
[2:53:09] <%Valdorick> And you CAN still equip 1
[2:53:12] <@Ranryu692> it's the fucking best
[2:53:12] <crob91> Wait, really? I don't remember that
[2:53:14] <%Valdorick> so you can double up the luck shard
[2:53:16] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[2:53:17] <%MonsterEnvy> Back in the ship you can actually see Zantgetsu boating in the back ground of a screen
[2:53:21] <%andrewofbob> Farm the luck shard so you can farm shards
[2:53:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> STACKS ON STACKS
[2:53:29] <%Jhylla81> Yup
[2:53:32] <+pectusumbra> I don't remember that, but cool
[2:53:33] <%RealThiele> farm time
[2:53:38] <%AgniBrandt> Oh yeah you can end this game ABSURDLY overpowered
[2:53:39] <%JonathLP> He's beginning to see through the matri-I mean game
[2:53:41] <%UvBenServed> Shit can get super broken
[2:53:41] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt yeah you can become the most overpowered motherfucker ever
[2:53:42] <Vashido22> its great
[2:53:54] <urkleturtle> passive shards are fairly rare drops
[2:53:57] <+pectusumbra> @AgniBrandt which is good given what nightmare mode is like
[2:53:59] <Zap_Rowsdower32> The drop rate in this game is rather generous compared to the handheld Castlevania
[2:54:05] <+storkeylope> He got that Baiken sweep
[2:54:07] <%Jhylla81> I maxed out like half of the passive shards
[2:54:12] <Raldavar> You could max out flame cannon as should as you get access to the shop till it was patch. Now it takes 10 more mins of farming the 1st level LUL
[2:54:13] <%RealThiele> generous drop rate is still like 5%
[2:54:15] <Iwashi94> gun cheese build was how I beat the final boss
[2:54:23] <XionBarzhad> Shard farming sucks so much.
[2:54:23] <+pectusumbra> might be worth healing and saving
[2:54:34] <+Catpurnicus> you need the time stop to farm better
[2:54:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> In gacha terms thats basically 100% LUL
[2:54:36] <%Valdorick> I maxed out every single shard... uuuuuuuugh
[2:54:39] <Vashido22> SourPls
[2:54:46] <%RealThiele> weed
[2:54:50] <%andrewofbob> Thanks, flytrap
[2:54:52] <+Catpurnicus> I love the flying pigs

[2:54:59] <+re_double> time to die
[2:55:04] <%RealThiele> flying pig soul is crazy gopod
[2:55:06] <%MonsterEnvy> Barbados here gives a great shard
[2:55:07] <+pectusumbra> @Das_Beergut yes, the first time
[2:55:14] <+justianxix> launch with the what?
[2:55:18] <XionBarzhad> Played this since beta so can probably answer w/e you were wanting to ask
[2:55:20] <%RyTYoung> I used the flying pigs for most of the game my first time round, best spell just spam pigs Kappa
[2:55:26] <+pectusumbra> I actually like the gambler boss a lot more in curse of the moon than ritual of the night. way more fun
[2:55:37] <jorniev> the clock tower of this game has my favorite song
[2:55:37] <%RealThiele> pigs just bounce around and murder the whole screen
[2:55:38] <Iwashi94> but what if you need it later? Kappa
[2:55:38] <%Valdorick> Mind Goblins = Defeat
[2:55:41] <Das_Beergut> @RyTYoung SPAM spam?
[2:55:42] <Zap_Rowsdower32> I didn't have much trouble getting all the shards, definitely felt easier than the Sorrow games.
[2:55:43] <%Keyd00d> Launch with the...
[2:55:47] <jifbua> but what if you need them later?
[2:55:48] <+pectusumbra> care, dangerous area

[2:59:32] <%Mendin> Wall chicken canonized
[2:59:33] <+justianxix> a chicken in a wall perhaps
[2:59:34] <Gregorhasjoined> Get it?
[2:59:36] <XionBarzhad> See your problem buddy is that you're looking in chests and not in the walls
[2:59:37] <fuji_n2> huh
[2:59:38] <+quackisalive> Wouldn't it be cool to live in a Castlevania style castle?
[2:59:38] <+re_double> later

[2:59:47] <%Mendin> Ominous-ass bloodmoon
[2:59:55] <Das_Beergut> @quackisalive Nah, it'd be a b*tch to heat
[3:00:09] <+terry_quest> Jebaited
[3:00:16] <@Ranryu692> the shortcut IS the secret
[3:00:26] <%Valdorick> No secret YET.
[3:00:33] <Sonny_Firestorm> Is this another game Pat has mind goblins over?
[3:00:37] <%moonmintparadise> shoot the pig at an angle so it bounces around a lot
[3:01:00] <Das_Beergut> Scrape every wall, get rewards
[3:01:01] <%Valdorick> They REWARD your Goblins
[3:01:02] <hakumaribo> yep

[3:01:07] <+AlucardX60> Why that moon like that?
[3:01:08] <Treasure_Vault> You can 100% it
[3:01:10] <Das_Beergut> Gather 9 shards, get power
[3:01:12] <%RyTYoung> yeah that makes sense
[3:01:13] <+twohitgood> gimme all masteries
[3:01:15] <+Grayhammatter> wug those halls
[3:01:15] <pixelkenj> does that include farming for 1% drops
[3:01:18] <%rekinom> I think the correct answer was "Mind gobblin deez nuts"

[3:01:19] <PanicSwytch> Must feed the Goblins
[3:01:22] <+FingaLights> Goblin maker

[3:01:23] <+SargentToughie> This game rewarded my obsessive need to grind souls to max level *very* kindly
[3:01:24] <sirrice77> Does that make Iga the goblin king
[3:01:25] <%Mendin> Moon's haunted
[3:01:25] <Vashido22> I hope pat plays Touhou Luna Nights and the Record of Lodoss War metroidvania, they're great metroidvanias

[3:01:47] <MaybeFalco> there's also just so much shit to get that it's hard to care if you miss something
[3:01:47] <zodiark26> lol
[3:01:48] <JobbedBone> "I look at the moon and I see a perfect society"
[3:01:48] <+AlucardX60> Pat's right. I 100%'d this game because I needed to max everything.

[3:03:55] <+justianxix> EEEE OOOOOO

[3:04:07] <snivins> the parry not stoping it is bullshit LUL
[3:04:23] <+pectusumbra> good jumps
[3:04:26] <grimm_hatter> why no triple kick across gaps
[3:04:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> It stops if they die. Kappa
[3:04:30] <JobbedBone> etalPumpIt
[3:04:30] <+twohitgood> * farming chainsaw blade guy is worth it.
[3:04:31] <+re_double> why patrick jumped down
[3:04:32] <+Fetrigon> @snivins learn spacing PunOko
[3:04:34] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[3:04:36] <@Ranryu692> this entire castle looks suspicious
[3:04:37] <tattleworm> heck yeah lethal boots
[3:04:39] <%RyTYoung> Has Pat figured out he can learn techniques early? Kappa
[3:04:47] <%AncelDeLambert> "There might be wall chicken here!!"
[3:04:48] <+quackisalive> Wait is that boots so you can Mario mf'ers?
[3:04:50] <Das_Beergut> These boots are made for slaying, and that's just what they'll do...
[3:04:51] <%TheDullaMAN> Yes.
[3:04:51] <%Mendin> Hey Pat could you move your face to the bottom-right so we see all your delicious item pop-ups?
[3:04:52] <%rosysyntax> lethal boots for maximum cheese
[3:04:55] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt The lethal boots have a skill if you want to see
[3:05:07] <JobbedBone> because all the assets are so smooth but the map is still grid based
[3:05:27] <pixelkenj> I think you can randomly input one you dont know if you guess correctly
[3:05:28] <%floornine> ‚ÄúHey I know you‚Äôre sick, but what‚Äôs the fifth letter of the alphabet?‚Äù EEEEE OOOO
[3:05:36] <%charp35> You don't need to read the books to unlock the technique by the way you can just do them
[3:05:38] <+WeLucklessJacks> Yeah, it's an annoying thing if you don't have the weapon on hand immediately to do it.
[3:05:40] <Vashido22> down down
[3:05:41] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, just use every basic fighting game input on every weapon, it'll probably show up
[3:05:41] <%rosysyntax> they're extremely cool
[3:05:42] <Profmcstevie> Shout out to Sword Brothers in Symphony of the Night, fucking charge inputs
[3:05:42] <@GeneralSCPatton> Down down attack in air
[3:05:44] <%TheDullaMAN> Try Down Down
[3:05:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Un
[3:05:51] <%DEETRz> you can just do them
[3:05:51] <pixelkenj> yeeeee
[3:05:51] <%AncelDeLambert> deux
[3:05:51] <Vashido22> yes
[3:05:52] <%TheDullaMAN> Yup
[3:05:52] <+hush_wolf> whoa sick
[3:05:53] <+justianxix> repeat
[3:05:53] <+Joe2187> do QCF
[3:05:53] <SaltyAzteca> yep
[3:05:53] <fuji_n2> yes
[3:05:54] <+Fetrigon> yo those are sick woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[3:05:54] <%RyTYoung> yep
[3:05:55] <%AncelDeLambert> KORAAAAH!
[3:05:57] <XionBarzhad> You have to have the correct weapon and know the input.
[3:06:00] <zodiark26> chain them
[3:06:01] <Das_Beergut> Un, deux, trois
[3:06:01] <MayShip> just mash out all the fighting game inputs. half the time that does something
[3:06:03] <+pectusumbra> yeah you can do stuff as long as you have the right weapon and input
[3:06:03] <%moonmintparadise> yes the books just show you the inputs
[3:06:04] <nansex> just like sotn
[3:06:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> You either find a hint book, or figure out without it.
[3:06:06] <SaltyAzteca> Just mash buttons til something happens LUL
[3:06:06] <+Joe2187> use Kung Fu boots skill
[3:06:09] <+hush_wolf> this game is deep bruh
[3:06:13] <%TheDullaMAN> Most weapons have one leaning skill.
[3:06:15] <Radioactivetaco9> so you just gotta try everysingle motion input you know when you pick up a new weapon :)
[3:06:16] <+tempestzephyr> Hazanshu
[3:06:16] <SaltyAzteca> Yes
[3:06:20] <pixelkenj> some
[3:06:25] <+pectusumbra> yeah usually to sets of weapons
[3:06:26] <+Joe2187> Wear those kung fu boots and become chun li
[3:06:27] <XionBarzhad> Once you master it, it can be used with every weapon of that type.
[3:06:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Becomes universal once you master it.
[3:06:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> Until mastered
[3:06:30] <Profmcstevie> Like spells, you technically know all your special inputs
[3:06:32] <%andrewofbob> When mastered, the technique is useable for all weapons of that type
[3:06:32] <+ocelotshotfirst> Thank god
[3:06:39] <%Animatic_> Animatic_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! shoe rekkas are very good.
[3:06:45] <Vashido22> hell yeah
[3:06:46] <Das_Beergut> Boot weapons are used for minor sequence breaks
[3:06:47] <@Ranryu692> yeyeye

[3:06:52] <fuji_n2> yes, I love it
[3:06:53] <%TheDullaMAN> Yes, and it is.
[3:06:54] <%AncelDeLambert> sadly it drags in the last quarter
[3:06:54] <CodeKirugin> This game is great.
[3:06:54] <+the_drummaestro> YEE
[3:06:54] <+pectusumbra> Its good. I really should revisit it myself
[3:06:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its very poggers
[3:06:55] <+Grayhammatter> heck yeah
[3:06:55] <+justianxix> Loving the BLUD
[3:06:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> biggus funnus
[3:06:56] <Sol_Install> ncie game
[3:06:56] <+Fetrigon> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[3:06:57] <%RyTYoung> I'm shocked you didn't go back to it until now
[3:06:57] <Treasure_Vault> Reminds me of the secret moves in twisted metal.
[3:06:57] <ExpressNode> Change the blood to white
[3:06:57] <2dhurrah> yeah this games lit
[3:06:59] <%Valdorick> Its a bop, it fucking sucks your save file corrupted before
[3:06:59] <Sol_Install> nice*
[3:07:01] <+Pixel_Matt> Yeah
[3:07:02] <%orbulon> yeah, put a lot of time into this game
[3:07:03] <Das_Beergut> I am having a Highly Excellent time
[3:07:04] <+the_drummaestro> gonna play it again because of you
[3:07:06] <+hush_wolf> ive never played, should i buy?
[3:07:06] <+FingaLights> It's a good game
[3:07:09] <+Grayhammatter> making me want to play through it again
[3:07:09] <%Keyd00d> psaGoblin
[3:07:12] <%Jhylla81> @PatStaresAt If I remember correctly if you master a technique you can use it whenever you equip that type of weapon
[3:07:14] <+quackisalive> Isn't this the game you said looked garbage on the podcast when it came out XD
[3:07:16] <Treasure_Vault> The right way to play, you mean?
[3:07:17] <%Mendin> Pat playing the Tactics Advance style
[3:07:19] <Vashido22> this stream is making me want to play this again, so hell yeah
[3:07:20] <%RyTYoung> Did Woolie play through Ritual of the night?
[3:07:23] <+croutonian> bloodstained really snowballs in quality, the longer you spend with it the more fun it gets
[3:07:25] <%kainhighwind1990> There are wayyyyyy too many abilities to master imo
[3:07:25] <%kulmoth> i liked the game, its kinda jank in places but it very much hit the castelvania spot
[3:07:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I recently started Outer Wilds but I am doing some shinanigans to get PS5 controler rumble and it makes the game SO MUCH MORE
[3:07:33] <%TheDullaMAN> The Katana has the most moves
[3:07:34] <+PrimalDweeb> She sounds like someone doing a poor imitation of a crow! LUL
[3:07:35] <@Ranryu692> I regret playing this on game pass and not buying it
[3:07:35] <Profmcstevie> The goblin of "wanting things"?
[3:07:36] <jifbua> can you show off what the ''shitty'' armore looks like?
[3:07:37] <+pectusumbra> that's fair. get the move, then transmute a better katana
[3:07:37] <Sonny_Firestorm> Katanas get a ton of imput moves for whatever reason.
[3:07:39] <+Fooguwu> @PatStaresAt I would love to see you finish this. I never got to myself, cuz of the big disabled
[3:07:41] <%andrewofbob> DOG
[3:07:41] <+ocelotshotfirst> Boss gonna be good
[3:07:42] <PanicSwytch> Suuure Pat...its "not" a goblin
[3:07:42] <theshillman> boublin
[3:07:43] <%Keyd00d> Nah you're right
[3:07:43] <Saltmeisterr> DOG ACQUIRED
[3:07:44] <zodiark26> it is goblin! but its good goblin!
[3:07:45] <MechanizedGentleman> OhMyDog
[3:07:45] <+FingaLights> Yeah, that's how I played too
[3:07:47] <Das_Beergut> Dog Launcher!
[3:07:47] <+Grayhammatter> summon pupper
[3:07:52] <urkleturtle> wanting things is a goblin. become buddha
[3:07:55] <ExpressNode> This game does have some awkward stiffness but I can get over it with enough time after putting it down
[3:07:57] <pyjama_day> @PatStaresAt youll eventually be able to equip movesets to a shortcut menu, so youll be able to use whatever you want, and get your parry back in just 2 button inputs or whatever
[3:07:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> ATTACK ZANGIEF
[3:07:58] <%andrewofbob> psaDogchamp
[3:07:59] <%Jhylla81> The parry is great once you get the timing down
[3:08:03] <Saltmeisterr> Omg its just attack cats from Aria
[3:08:14] <Das_Beergut> Zangiftsu
[3:08:23] <Ralfclogs> Go Gief go
[3:08:23] <+pectusumbra> If they did another kickstarter would you try to get elmo or zangief in the game?
[3:08:29] <pyjama_day> *equipment loadouts
[3:08:31] <JobbedBone> red shelled dog
[3:08:35] <jorniev> a bit
[3:08:45] <+twohitgood> elmo as one of the enemies would be great.
[3:08:46] <@ssjklyco> Pillers

[3:08:58] <@Ranryu692> *Pillars
[3:09:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Where?
[3:09:04] <ExpressNode> Thats if I don't die before they release the next one
[3:09:07] <%Jhylla81> ( still need to properly play Circle of the moon 2
[3:09:08] <jorniev> ZUBAZ mask is in this game right?
[3:09:10] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt btw, that big lion's shard might be important for Katana builds later down the line, just saying

[3:10:17] <MechanizedGentleman> Become Denji
[3:10:22] <Ralfclogs> noice
[3:10:23] <+quackisalive> eeeeeeee oooooohhhhh
[3:10:24] <urkleturtle> it got nerfed. it's still good but not stupid anymore
[3:10:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now YOU are the csbeastE csbeastE csbeastE
[3:10:26] <%Jhylla81> Heretical grinder is great built up
[3:10:27] <%Animatic_> wait, there's parries in this game now?!
[3:10:30] <hakumaribo> Grinder has a really good weapon drop as well
[3:10:32] <NickelCanvas> @d00msdaydan heck yeah they were
[3:10:39] <+pectusumbra> woo!
[3:10:43] <JobbedBone> this at home drug test says "zig zag bud" is a synonym for weed LUL I think its targeted at zoomers
[3:10:43] <MaybeFalco> Eeee Ooouuughhh
[3:10:53] <XionBarzhad> @Animatic_ Certain weapons have parry techniques
[3:10:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why does the phrase Heretical Grinder make me think of a sandwich
[3:10:56] <JobbedBone> boomers*
[3:10:59] <@Ranryu692> I love all the stained glass in this game
[3:11:03] <deity_majora> @PatStaresAt  Commander_Claw put Elmo in.
[3:11:07] <+terry_quest> cant make shit
[3:11:08] <%Animatic_> oh, sick.
[3:11:08] <jorniev> was katana or sword the one with the most moves? i remember spear getting a really crazy sprint
[3:11:09] <+pectusumbra> I think you can get stuff from the nun for cooking?
[3:11:13] <%Bluwizard21> gathering the ingredients for everything was a pain in the ass
[3:11:13] <%JH1224> A lot of the stuff can be bought next door
[3:11:14] <%orbulon> you can get basic ingredients from anne
[3:11:15] <%andrewofbob> Might want to unlock the farm
[3:11:15] <%JonathLP> Need rice
[3:11:16] <XionBarzhad> FYI Pat, anything you can craft is automatically brought to the top of the list.
[3:11:17] <tattleworm> you can buy some ingredients next door
[3:11:18] <snivins> did you find the farmer?
[3:11:18] <fuji_n2> buy stuff to make stuff at the shop
[3:11:19] <Sonny_Firestorm> Cooking is OP, so it's tricky to do
[3:11:19] <%Animatic_> i basically only did shoes when I played.
[3:11:19] <@GeneralSCPatton> But ingredients
[3:11:20] <%andrewofbob> Like, agriculture farm
[3:11:21] <MechanizedGentleman> buy ingredients
[3:11:23] <californaya> dude, I used Heretical Grinder for like 90% of this game, that shit's broken
[3:11:23] <%Animatic_> so i had no idea.
[3:11:23] <+terry_quest> dosent he sell ingridents?
[3:11:24] <@GeneralSCPatton> *Buy
[3:11:25] <ChatNinja> a lot of basic has to be bought
[3:11:27] <MarylandJutsu> @Ranryu692 stained glass is one of the most prettiest of art mediums imo
[3:11:30] <+AlucardX60> You can grow crops outside.
[3:11:30] <%floornine> There‚Äôs a shop across the hall
[3:11:40] <+ocelotshotfirst> That Castle came from the Hell
[3:11:40] <%JoshManVGH> Smashing, Johan
[3:11:45] <MarylandJutsu> I can't beileve Mirian is a dio stand
[3:11:46] <%Keyd00d> Some kind of Castle in a Vania
[3:11:46] <+pectusumbra> WOW, I don't remember this
[3:11:47] <Das_Beergut> "One toot on this whistle will send you to a far away land!"
[3:11:51] <MarylandJutsu> *stan
[3:11:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> Foreshadowing KEKW
[3:11:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHY
[3:12:00] <MechanizedGentleman> rice, potatoes, and corn need to be grown in the farm
[3:12:02] <%andrewofbob> Save?
[3:12:07] <MacMog> sure, let me research the Summon Hell-Castle ritual
[3:12:10] <%floornine> Thank you, Mr. Diskin
[3:12:13] <Sonny_Firestorm> DOMMY MOMMY TIME
[3:12:13] <%JoshManVGH> Temmin'it'grew... outta hell
[3:12:16] <+FingaLights> Oh yeah, I forgot about farming
[3:12:17] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt now that I think about it, are the alchemist  not fucking up in any media ever?
[3:12:19] <%Tearonex> Holy shit that guy voiced young Joseph in part 2 LUL
[3:12:20] <@GeneralSCPatton> Go outside to the left for a farm
[3:12:20] <+twohitgood> yes. craft all the foods.
[3:12:20] <Das_Beergut> Make a lasagna!

[3:12:28] <MarylandJutsu> This ma'ams outfit is not church approved
[3:12:29] <artoflec> do NOT eat the mercury pat
[3:12:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> sick I thought I was typing but I wasn't and now the joke is gone reeeeeeeeeeeee
[3:12:29] <ginger_robinson> Goddamn it @Sonny_Firestorm you beat me too it
[3:12:32] <+Grayhammatter> buy stuff to make food i guess
[3:12:32] <+terry_quest> yes eat mercury
[3:12:33] <jorniev> HALITE is SALT
[3:12:34] <XionBarzhad> Sort 2 categories over, you'll find ingredients
[3:12:34] <JobbedBone> good idea
[3:12:35] <+twohitgood> you'll need more than one of each.
[3:12:35] <%TheDullaMAN> You could make some stuff
[3:12:36] <+justianxix> thats what I did
[3:12:39] <%JoshManVGH> Mmm delicious sulfer
[3:12:39] <%kknutson4> You want to eat 1 of each food for the buffs
[3:12:40] <+pectusumbra> crafting foods is worth your time to get HUGE
[3:12:40] <urkleturtle> then you'd have one of each food
[3:12:42] <Dopamien> elaLibido elaLibido elaLibido
[3:12:43] <+twohitgood> you'll want a few eggs and flours.
[3:12:43] <shadoke> buy the seeds to have the guy up above plant them for you
[3:12:45] <jorniev> WELCOME TO POOR TOWN
[3:12:47] <MarylandJutsu> just like going to the grocery store
[3:12:47] <Estuko> Masterworks all you can't go wron
[3:12:49] <%waltzqueen> Tasty!
[3:12:51] <jorniev> POPULATION PAT
[3:12:51] <+AlucardX60> Or you could grow the foods.
[3:12:59] <+ocelotshotfirst> Making Food is the best part of this game.
[3:13:10] <MechanizedGentleman> gotta GROW rice
[3:13:11] <@Ranryu692> @MarylandJutsu I agree. I actually had some stained glass windows growing up because the apartment got no direct sunlight, so some previous tenant had replaced a few windows with backlit stained glass. it was awesome
[3:13:12] <MarylandJutsu> mmmm egg
[3:13:13] <Das_Beergut> You have to grow your own rice
[3:13:13] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:13:15] <+pectusumbra> you have to grow rice I think, or get it as a drop?
[3:13:15] <%TheDullaMAN> Gotta grow rice, first
[3:13:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> just eat a raw stick of butter like a feral animal
[3:13:15] <XionBarzhad> Some food ingredients only get sold once discovered
[3:13:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOU MUST GROW RICE
[3:13:18] <ArmadaGeddra> you need food for the old woman side quests
[3:13:20] <Sonny_Firestorm> Crafting Dough from Flour unlocks Dough on shop.
[3:13:26] <jorniev> rice is from JAPANIPPON after all
[3:13:28] <Vashido22> yeah the food system is legit fun
[3:13:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Go outside to the left for a farm

[3:38:13] <+Fooguwu> i wonder how many backers have been killed by themselves
[3:38:14] <worldbrand> does the shard still play the voice line every time?
[3:38:16] <MarylandJutsu> @GeneralSCPatton summon the poewr of patren to kill foes
[3:38:33] <hakumaribo> different builds
[3:38:35] <%andrewofbob> Instant loadouts
[3:38:35] <+izanagi22> You can make builds!
[3:38:36] <+pectusumbra> you can have loadouts
[3:38:37] <+Toficque> loadouts
[3:38:38] <%Animatic_> you can make sets now.
[3:38:39] <+Jaromero435> those are loadouts
[3:38:41] <worldbrand> they're loadout slots
[3:38:41] <Vashido22> oh yeah, shortcut is for preset builds
[3:38:42] <+AlucardX60> Nothing assigned to the shortcut.
[3:38:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Item loadouts
[3:38:44] <Louie_Salmon> It I remember right the poltergeist shard is super good
[3:38:44] <%kainhighwind1990> Its so you can save loadouts
[3:38:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> loadouts
[3:38:52] <Sigma_190_Beta> Loadouts.
[3:38:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> cause it's set to nothing
[3:39:01] <fuji_n2> you gotta save the loadout first
[3:39:01] <+terry_quest> you have to save it with the weapon
[3:39:01] <+pectusumbra> because the loadout starts empty
[3:39:08] <tattleworm> the loadout's empty so using it is unequipping your gear
[3:39:10] <MechanizedGentleman> cannot comprehend new mechanics
[3:39:14] <%andrewofbob> SwordgungtrickFIST
[3:39:17] <Louie_Salmon> There you go
[3:39:40] <MarylandJutsu> you pasted the same thing
[3:39:42] <Treasure_Vault> You pasted current and overwrote the mace.
[3:39:43] <+Grayhammatter> you copied the same one
[3:39:45] <KaiserMario> Damn, Pat is bad at menus LUL
[3:39:54] <+pectusumbra> so you can instantly switch between shards, element builds, or different weapons to juggle different moves
[3:40:00] <marvel877> Reading is hard
[3:40:01] <+izanagi22> I imagine it helps for technique grinding
[3:40:03] <tattleworm> it's nice later on so you can quick swap to traversal skills or whatever
[3:40:03] <%JoshManVGH> LP Tax
[3:40:07] <+izanagi22> OH THESE THINGS
[3:40:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> @KaiserMario Why do you think he gets mind goblins with Nioh? LUL
[3:40:08] <+Fooguwu> is it tho
[3:40:09] <Louie_Salmon> Definitely useful later
[3:40:14] <+re_double> run
[3:40:14] <+Fooguwu> CURSED
[3:40:14] <Profmcstevie> Pats UX is to mash and be surprised at the menus
[3:40:15] <FullMetalSnorlax> it's good for gringding, you can quickly switch between a luck build and a normal one
[3:40:26] <+pectusumbra> Yeah, that bitch is REAL
[3:40:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wew
[3:40:32] <MechanizedGentleman> Nice HP you got there Kappa
[3:40:34] <+pectusumbra> also she's weak to fire
[3:40:34] <%RealThiele> proper curse
[3:40:35] <@GeneralSCPatton> Loadouts are great
[3:40:36] <worldbrand> you also dont have to fill every part of the loadout
[3:40:38] <+izanagi22> She will fuck you up
[3:40:38] <stranger59> Oh, I remember this area well now, those things were rough.
[3:40:39] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, that's a real one
[3:40:41] <%TimetodiveLTX> no jiggle physics mod huh
[3:40:43] <+boti_balint> ! CURSED !
[3:40:59] <hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt those evil barber guys drop one of the best weapons in the game.
[3:41:00] <Treasure_Vault> The drill seems good for bosses, but maybe less good for mobs?
[3:41:02] <KaiserMario> Change the channel name to "PatisBadAt"
[3:41:05] <brunoberserk> weird but useful , this is a thing since dawn of sorrow
[3:41:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> Curse isn't just tough, the way you get Curse Resistance yellow shard is awful to find/grind. (likely on purpose)
[3:41:07] <FullMetalSnorlax> there is nothing good behind the scary ghost at the top, you can just take the right path.
[3:41:07] <$Emperor_Machinus> backer destroyed
[3:41:20] <Sonny_Firestorm> I said things don't move DURING the animation.
[3:41:23] <+Fooguwu> maybe once mastered or something?
[3:41:29] <KaiserMario> I love the Buer
[3:41:40] <Das_Beergut> @KaiserMario We're here for entertainment, not perfection
[3:41:40] <pixelkenj> I didnt move
[3:41:44] <+haitakaa> one guy
[3:41:51] <%TimetodiveLTX> oh is pat grinding ON screen?
[3:41:54] <pixelkenj> was it the katana parry?
[3:41:56] <%andrewofbob> Mastered = available for all similar weapons, woolieONEGUY
[3:41:58] <+FingaLights> I held my breath
[3:42:02] <%RealThiele> uno hombre
[3:42:07] <+re_double> it's because that one guy
[3:42:08] <MarylandJutsu> AMAZING
[3:42:09] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat you died.
[3:42:09] <KaiserMario> @Das_Beergut I never said I wasn't entertained
[3:42:10] <+Fooguwu> ya she for real
[3:42:11] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> psa1guy
[3:42:13] <+pectusumbra> command grab
[3:42:16] <$Emperor_Machinus> can't believe one guy killed Pat
[3:42:16] <%waltzqueen> RIP riPepperonis
[3:42:19] <+Fooguwu> PAT LOOK OUT
[3:42:19] <+pectusumbra> fire is good on her
[3:42:20] <%vivaldiva> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[3:42:21] <Sarcastastic> STAIN THAT BLOOD
[3:42:26] <Profmcstevie> Chat I think it's time to just stop talking, this is like the 5th One Guy this stream
[3:42:28] <+pectusumbra> that's pretty good though!
[3:42:29] <@Ranryu692> yeah that's a good one
[3:42:36] <+Grayhammatter> god DAMN
[3:42:38] <EmeraldLance> The katana parry stops time when it hits
[3:42:42] <Sonny_Firestorm> Gun Build is super OP in this game.
[3:42:45] <tattleworm> you get more arrows for each dupe too, it gets stupid
[3:42:49] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, I just started reading Berserk recently and I was wondering if any of the shows or video games are good?
[3:42:51] <Zombrocom> I don't remember shit about this game so I just keep quiet
[3:42:51] <%studleydoorite> jermaOneguy jermaOneguy jermaOneguy jermaOneguy jermaOneguy
[3:42:54] <%TimetodiveLTX> your mom stops time when i hit
[3:42:58] <%waltzqueen> @Profmcstevie everyone trying to get their yearly quotas done with lol
[3:42:59] <Elykial> pat do you like hummus
[3:43:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @timetodiveltx nice LUL
[3:43:19] <Das_Beergut> @Sonny_Firestorm GUN is my favorite 8bit weapon
[3:43:19] <%andrewofbob> iframes are not timestops, chat
[3:43:20] <EmeraldLance> only on the parry though
[3:43:25] <Sonny_Firestorm> Huh, maybe they patched it out of the game? Been a while since I played this game.
[3:43:27] <fuji_n2> nice
[3:43:28] <swordoftheberserk> @kainhighwind1990 the 97 anime is good, and the ps2 and dreamcast games are alright
[3:43:29] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> They are not moving, the world is moving them
[3:43:31] <+Fooguwu> BTW, drillsword can cheese enemies through walls IIRC
[3:43:32] <codydudetm> This "time stop" jape has gotten into Pat's head rent free
[3:43:33] <+ikantreeed> Do u guys know any other good metroidvania with RPG aspect kinda like this one on steam?
[3:43:37] <%Alazull> One Guy is getting styled on today
[3:43:40] <fuji_n2> I'd go back and save even
[3:43:52] <Zombrocom> I think its just good on her because it lets you keep away?
[3:43:55] <%andrewofbob> You could check it in the bestiary
[3:44:00] <%bevyrage> you're dealing 20 damage with the other attack compared to 15 with the fire weakness
[3:44:00] <fuji_n2> idk
[3:44:00] <stranger59> She just is
[3:44:01] <%bevyrage> rip
[3:44:02] <hakumaribo> your not meant to fuck with them yet
[3:44:02] <+re_double> banshee goes thru walls too tho
[3:44:03] <MayShip> because ghoooooooost
[3:44:04] <Tatsabutt> ikantreeed blasphemous, vigil the longest night, hollow knight
[3:44:05] <+Catpurnicus> to let you know this area is real
[3:44:07] <Das_Beergut> Truely, the Dark Sould of videogames!
[3:44:12] <pixelkenj> L4D witch energy
[3:44:13] <tattleworm> dark souls graveyard design
[3:44:14] <+pectusumbra> her shard is the scream attack, but yeah, she's just really nasty early enemy
[3:44:15] <+izanagi22> I just run from her tbh
[3:44:15] <Treasure_Vault> So you go right.
[3:44:15] <%waltzqueen> You're weak to Ghost Type
[3:44:16] <aeonicVector> its to signify "if you havent yet, dont be afraid to go back for powerups/food"
[3:44:18] <%andrewofbob> But yeah, areas of the game will just throw in one enemy that's super real
[3:44:20] <FullMetalSnorlax> there isn't anything good behind her, its a COME BACK LATER enemny
[3:44:24] <+WeLucklessJacks> She does a lot of cardio.
[3:44:32] <+blue_twitch> what's ordog
[3:44:32] <Profmcstevie> Or dog
[3:44:33] <Sonny_Firestorm> To remind players that Iga doesn't fuck around.
[3:44:34] <Profmcstevie> the Ordog
[3:44:44] <PortableBoredom> Was there a reason why Pat spent like ten minutes in that last room
[3:44:45] <+re_double> no chicken huh
[3:44:45] <+ikantreeed> @Tatsabutt thanks
[3:44:47] <Sarcastastic> god the music in this game is so good
[3:44:48] <worldbrand> a lot of the game has been rebalanced since launch from what i've heard
[3:44:51] <+TheBitingIrish> SourPls
[3:44:52] <%andrewofbob> Welcome back!
[3:44:54] <MaybeFalco> LUL
[3:44:54] <fuji_n2> nice

[3:44:57] <+Fooguwu> pat no
[3:44:59] <Louie_Salmon> Hmm
[3:44:59] <zodiark26> lol
[3:45:00] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:45:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> rip
[3:45:05] <FullMetalSnorlax> all you missed was a hat in that room on the loeft
[3:45:06] <Das_Beergut> Why is she so strong? Kagels.
[3:45:06] <Sol_Install> nice
[3:45:08] <+pectusumbra> pain peko
[3:45:09] <+FingaLights> Shortcut
[3:45:12] <+Catpurnicus> fallling is a one way shortcut
[3:45:12] <EmeraldLance> That's how it be sometimes
[3:45:12] <fuji_n2> never punished
[3:45:14] <ZaerichAnakalypton> Welp, unintentional shard farming time
[3:45:15] <+Fooguwu> Never drop before checking out the top smh
[3:45:15] <Vashido22> thats why you should open the big map before a leap of faith LUL
[3:45:27] <+pectusumbra> @FullMetalSnorlax but was it a tiny hat? :p
[3:45:34] <Elykial> i forgot after like 2 minutes playing this there were special moves for the weapons and just went through the game like a new SOTN
[3:45:45] <+ikantreeed> i hate those backers prtraits so much. i their a mod to remove them LUL?
[3:45:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> Oh hey Jirard.
[3:46:01] <FullMetalSnorlax> @FullMetalSnorlax No it's the biggest hat in the game :P
[3:46:01] <%TimetodiveLTX> @ikantreeed iirc there actually is
[3:46:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ikantreeed I'm told that the Record of Lodoss War metroidvania that Team Ladybug did is also very good and hits the same notes as Castlevania, but I haven't played through it myself yet
[3:46:22] <FullMetalSnorlax> daggers and rappiers have the best DPS in the game
[3:46:24] <+FingaLights> @Elykial but SOTN has special moves doesn't it?
[3:46:27] <+izanagi22> Lodoss even has the Alucard shadow from SotN
[3:46:28] <+ikantreeed> @Valentinius_Anodyne iHave it it's pretty good
[3:46:32] <PortableBoredom> @ikantreeed There's mods for everything, I'm sure there's something to get rid of all these kickstarter nerds
[3:46:36] <Das_Beergut> Oh sure, Miriam stabs a few bats it's it's "Game of the Year"; I stab ONE bat with a knife and all of a sudden I need to "Leave the Zoo immediatly"
[3:46:37] <+pectusumbra> @Valentinius_Anodyne I played it but only for a little bit. admittedly not as into the IP so it didn't grab me as hard as something like Luna Nights did
[3:46:40] <theredfox930000> @valentinius_anodyne that game is godlike and on gamepass
[3:46:40] <%kknutson4> Speaking of metroidvanias, I just finished Ender Lilies.  It was pretty good
[3:46:41] <+hush_wolf> @Valentinius_Anodyne it is very good, very pretty too
[3:46:47] <Elykial> does it?! like the QCF and stuff?
[3:46:57] <%VashyronM> @FingaLights ish. you have Alucards spells, but only a couple are really useful
[3:47:01] <+AlucardX60> @Valentinius_Anodyne It's movement is VERY SotN and I liked the use of the element system.
[3:47:01] <+ikantreeed> I don't like ender lilies
[3:47:06] <+Catpurnicus> yeaaaaaah
[3:47:15] <PortableBoredom> Gross.
[3:47:20] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Lisa had the best backer characters
[3:47:21] <+Catpurnicus> poochies of eternity
[3:47:21] <Sonny_Firestorm> @FullMetalSnorlax Recycle Hat + Diamond Bullets + Best Gun would like to have a word with ya. LUL
[3:47:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> Their stories suck
[3:47:26] <%cvp5127> they put fanfiction in the  game?
[3:47:30] <%Logoth_> how cringe?
[3:47:30] <+Demoli_PT> what about pathfinder
[3:47:30] <+FingaLights> I think things like shield Rod and other weapons have special moves
[3:47:31] <gespenst25> The one in Pathfinder KIngmaker was pretty bad
[3:47:31] <PortableBoredom> But will anything ever top So Sorry as the worst Kickstarter character of all time
[3:47:32] <+ikantreeed> In this game i find the portraits cringe
[3:47:33] <%JoshManVGH> Is there a good way to avoid them?
[3:47:35] <%CalderGaming> Cheshire Chest
[3:47:37] <%TheDullaMAN> Blue Chests repop
[3:47:37] <Profmcstevie> Backers made NPCs with their own origin stories??
[3:47:37] <+Demoli_PT> it had that super cringe guy
[3:47:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> Blue chests refill
[3:47:38] <tattleworm> that one refills i think
[3:47:39] <+pectusumbra> the light blue ones refresh
[3:47:39] <+haitakaa> chesire chest
[3:47:39] <snivins> chest respawn
[3:47:40] <Sarcastastic> @PatStaresAt some chests respawn
[3:47:40] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Pathfinder Kingmaker also has a really cringe Backer insert
[3:47:41] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I think Hollow Knight has my favorite backer made stuff.
[3:47:41] <%Futurecity10> But you're also cringe pat
[3:47:42] <%whyskeywolfe> Get the Cheshire Chest, Pat.
[3:47:43] <%Logoth_> cheasure chest

[3:47:52] <+Toficque> I think some of the chests respawn
[3:47:52] <+Grayhammatter> some chests respawn
[3:47:54] <Zombrocom> Oooh Darven?
[3:47:55] <%hairtoday> darven is the worst
[3:47:57] <%TimetodiveLTX> i actually really dug how indulgent the portraits were
[3:47:57] <Zombrocom> Fuckin Darven
[3:47:58] <Vashido22> @ikantreeed not much RPG elements, but Touhou Luna Night is a SUPER good metroidvania
[3:47:59] <tanarath> Che-zure chest
[3:48:01] <shadoke> light blue treasure chests refill with crafting materials
[3:48:04] <%Deft_Thought> Invisible has some pretty bad Kickstarter designs in there
[3:48:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @JoshManVGH The Pillars ones have unique nameplates so you can just ignore them
[3:48:06] <Vashido22> like, actually top notch
[3:48:06] <%kulmoth> its laughable "teleports behind you" tier so yeah
[3:48:07] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt is it better or worse than the npcs in indivisible
[3:48:09] <%Valdorick> The Pathfinder one IS so bad its good
[3:48:10] <%Alazull> Inverse Cringe Principle
[3:48:10] <+Fooguwu> yeah good stand in the enemy
[3:48:17] <%TimetodiveLTX> like "we'll give you everything" sort of showman ship
[3:48:17] <Zombrocom> Darven is so bad I almost think it's satire
[3:48:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt does this mean conrad is a backer character?
[3:48:18] <MacMog> remember Divekick with that character The Baz?
[3:48:19] <%Jhylla81> a bunch of the chests respawn
[3:48:20] <Zombrocom> Almost
[3:48:21] <Zeif00> Remember that one dude who put his OC in every game he could find?
[3:48:23] <+pectusumbra> yeah, the blue ones have crafting materials so you can farm them based on certain areas
[3:48:24] <FullMetalSnorlax> @FullMetalSnorlax I often don't count the guns, as normal weapons. But they are broke as hell
[3:48:24] <EmeraldLance> Specifically, blue chests respawn
[3:48:37] <TheeRabbi> In Pillars of Eternity, almost all the backers picked the same race which--according to the lore--was meant to be EXCEPTIONALLY rare, destroying immersion instantly because they littered the streets of the first area.
[3:48:39] <Elykial> i remember that castlevania dude from shovel knight who cried when you win
[3:48:39] <%TimetodiveLTX> lmao

[3:48:53] <+TheBitingIrish> haHAA
[3:48:55] <+ikantreeed> @Vashido22 I just don't like the art style of that game sadly
[3:48:56] <%Valdorick> Reize
[3:48:56] <%D00msDayDan> oh you mean zubaz?
[3:49:00] <Treasure_Vault> It's cooler when your oc is a loser
[3:49:02] <MayShip> who would do such a thing
[3:49:02] <%waltzqueen> oooooo
[3:49:04] <dinnydanny777> Eee Oooo
[3:49:07] <Das_Beergut> @TheeRabbi Wasn't there also a debacle over a transphobic limerick?
[3:49:07] <KaiserMario> Baz isn't an OC, technically
[3:49:08] <Saltmeisterr> remember DARK REIZE?
[3:49:10] <Louie_Salmon> @elykial Yeah that castlevania dude, for sure
[3:49:11] <%floornine> You mean Mario?
[3:49:12] <Zap_Rowsdower32> The Baz is best boy
[3:49:14] <+kewlmyc> Funniest part is that Baz is fucking stolen from old Capcom artbooks
[3:49:14] <aeonicVector> that reminds me, still bummed a kickstarter i backed had a "no prexisting characters" clause, because i would've put himin
[3:49:15] <Vashido22> @ikantreeed thats unfortunate, the sprite work is beautiful
[3:49:20] <marvel877> Reize from Shovel Knight? He's okay. Now that Zubaz guy... oof.
[3:49:20] <Ipsenscastle> @D00msDayDan lol gottem
[3:49:23] <%roobanguy> LMAO
[3:49:26] <%RyTYoung> LUL

[3:49:40] <+justianxix> there's a hollowknight zubaz?
[3:49:42] <%waltzqueen> They were rgiht it was cool
[3:49:42] <MechanizedGentleman> there's a zubaz bug in hollow knight?
[3:49:45] <+terry_quest> i need to get hollow knight one of these days
[3:49:47] <FullMetalSnorlax> eventually the BAZ just became self-sustaining entity
[3:49:49] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt I love Shovel Knight Specter of Torment, but when I learned that two of the plot important characters were backer OCs....
[3:49:55] <aeonicVector> yeah, in the grave with all the backers
[3:49:55] <%JoshManVGH> Where the hell is The Baz in Hollow Knight?
[3:49:56] <Vashido22> I was surprised LUL
[3:49:58] <%moonmintparadise> The Zubug was a fun one
[3:49:58] <+ikantreeed> @Vashido22 they are ijust don't like the anime little girl mad ype shit too much
[3:50:02] <+pectusumbra> It's one way to make sure you are leveled and see some shards I suppose, but yeah, this game does do that kind of thing
[3:50:04] <MacMog> Bugbaz? Zubug?
[3:50:11] <%Valdorick> Remember when Reize's creator shit his ass because Shovel Knight's girls knight mode had CONCEPT ART of his OC as a woman?
[3:50:12] <aeonicVector> the boomarang one is great tho
[3:50:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Baz in Hollow Knight is in the graveyard
[3:50:13] <%Valdorick> Amazing.
[3:50:18] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Something wrong, Pat? Kappa
[3:50:21] <Saltmeisterr> @Vashido22 wait Luan is a back OC?
[3:50:23] <+ikantreeed> all OC's are cringe 2022
[3:50:25] <Vashido22> I fucking hate Reize
[3:50:25] <+ScrapKingKeita> at least they didn't self-insert themselves like LISA Kappa
[3:50:28] <+ikantreeed> stop being original
[3:50:29] <%moonmintparadise> not as bad as the furry in undertale with the diaper
[3:50:30] <Vashido22> @Vashido22 yes
[3:50:32] <dinnydanny777> Eee ooo
[3:50:35] <+Fooguwu> pat would NEVER be cringe
[3:50:35] <MayShip> i remember being excited for Indivisible guest characters. cool how that never happened.
[3:50:36] <Saltmeisterr> backer*
[3:50:37] <Vashido22> same maker as reize
[3:50:37] <@Ranryu692> stab him in the dick!
[3:50:37] <SharKinStereo> can the existence of cringe turn something based into cringe?
[3:50:39] <+CherteuseKapibara> :)
[3:50:41] <Zombrocom> EEE!..... ooooooooooh
[3:50:43] <Profmcstevie> If you didn't know that without lookign it up, I guess that'd be fine
[3:50:45] <+FingaLights> All characters are someones OC's if you think about it
[3:50:45] <stranger59> Characters are cringe in general.
[3:50:46] <tattleworm> feel like baz gets a pass since the joke is he sucks while most oc inclusions are "look how cool my oc is"
[3:50:47] <Das_Beergut> Miriam is just Igarashi's OC
[3:50:47] <PortableBoredom> Hopefully one day it'll just be a widely recognized fact that no one wants to see your OC you cyber on anime forums with as a character we have to interact with
[3:50:49] <%floornine> Technically all video game characters are OCs
[3:50:51] <Elykial> does this megaman the king of it? since they used to have fan contests i think?
[3:50:52] <+tempestzephyr> pat is marrying cringe
[3:50:53] <%waltzqueen> @moonmintparadise who
[3:50:54] <%Keyd00d> in the ohhh
[3:50:54] <+justianxix> Didn't you guys have OCs in LISA
[3:50:56] <$SGrim> Aren't all characters in original video games OC's?
[3:50:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt in a decade everyone would forget about it...and they will just become characters and at least Shovel Knight did it well
[3:50:59] <+TheBitingIrish> I mean, EVERY character is an OC
[3:51:03] <+ikantreeed> 100%
[3:51:03] <MacMog> controversial: video games should never have any characters
[3:51:14] <stranger59> You mean like the Baz?
[3:51:15] <+twohitgood> make your character have flaws because they'll be interesting.
[3:51:15] <+BelricPsytar> No...
[3:51:16] <+pectusumbra> here here!
[3:51:16] <%whyskeywolfe> That was the whole point of the Baz.
[3:51:18] <%RyTYoung> Like Harrier Du Bois?
[3:51:21] <+FingaLights> Losers are the coolest
[3:51:22] <Elykial> did you mean: travis touchdown
[3:51:22] <+SargentToughie> This describes me playing D&D
[3:51:23] <Das_Beergut> Like the butter dragon OC in Undertale?
[3:51:24] <Profmcstevie> Children wanna be Ryu, cool kids wanan be Dan
[3:51:24] <%JoshManVGH> Cringe but on purpose?
[3:51:24] <pixelkenj> knows the ropes but kinda sucks
[3:51:25] <+leviting> @MacMog isn't this the dnf duel approach?
[3:51:25] <Sol_Install> 100% disagree on that
[3:51:26] <aeonicVector> make em a fun gag so people WANT to remember them, not the strongest or tragic or w/e
[3:51:27] <+ikantreeed> That's why u always create urself in games
[3:51:27] <%Valdorick> Like BAZ?
[3:51:28] <WillofGame> Like Jon from Garfield?
[3:51:29] <Sol_Install> nah
[3:51:29] <%BreakfastSampler> Lester the Unlikely
[3:51:29] <Rav3Games> either make them a loser or make them suffer to an insurmountable degree
[3:51:30] <%waltzqueen> less Yusuke, more Kuwabara
[3:51:33] <%floornine> So like Zubaz?
[3:51:33] <worldbrand> if they were a loser everybody loved, that's pretty great
[3:51:34] <MayShip> just a regular guy who works at your local grocery store
[3:51:35] <%cvp5127> like travis
[3:51:35] <marvel877> Oh, remember that Plague guy in Indivisible? Man, who's OC was that? pfft.
[3:51:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i feel like it's best when they're just a normal person, neither lame or cool
[3:51:41] <brunoberserk> thats way we love zubaz
[3:51:42] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt I agree, that would at least make them memorable
[3:51:43] <+blue_twitch> benjamin the coolest backer character of all time
[3:51:43] <+ScrapKingKeita> Make them the shopkeeper
[3:51:44] <dinnydanny777> Kurt Zisa was kinda neat in kh1
[3:51:47] <+Demoli_PT> i dunno find these portaits not that bad as backer rewards
[3:51:47] <DartAran> Your OC should be like Asgore
[3:51:48] <%alcors_wisdom> its a spectrum if your character is too much of a looser their inclusion is just annoying if they're too cool then its just eye rolling
[3:51:48] <+Catpurnicus> baz the eternal jobber
[3:51:49] <@Ranryu692> my dnd wizard used Magic cards instead of having a spell book
[3:51:52] <PortableBoredom> @PatStaresAt There's a thing you can get later to master skills faster
[3:51:53] <+BelricPsytar> No, i would say for me ot changes from happy go lucky badass to grizzled im tired badass
[3:51:53] <EmeraldLance> Pat with the jump attack cancel tech
[3:51:55] <hakumaribo> NO FUCKING WAY
[3:51:55] <%moonmintparadise> @moonmintparadise look up "So Sorry", he was only available under a certain date and the guy irl was super cringe
[3:51:58] <%kainhighwind1990> THAT'S THE CRIS
[3:51:59] <Sonny_Firestorm> Kurt was just the name, not the design.
[3:51:59] <ChilledBlu> Never finished  this game, should probably go back and replay it
[3:52:02] <+Demoli_PT> especially the ones that play it into the style rather than being silly
[3:52:03] <%Alazull> Whereas if they're super cool I'm just going to forget about the not-main character
[3:52:03] <%bevyrage> nothing more cringe than mike z as himself in indivisible though
[3:52:04] <hakumaribo> oh man i thought you got the weapon
[3:52:05] <+Fooguwu> Strong enemy ahead, Therefore Try right
[3:52:05] <codydudetm> Purposefully make a super lame OC insert so bad people make a speedrun with them as a follower
[3:52:05] <%Valdorick> The Chad Loser Zubaz vs the Virgin Cool Rage of Africa
[3:52:07] <+swid_harry> Thats what my current DND character has become through bad rolls at key moments lol.
[3:52:08] <+pectusumbra> but yes, for that banshee, IF you level it all the way it's a pretty big AoE attack but it's not worth it right now
[3:52:08] <urkleturtle> that's what a loser would think. winners make ocs that can kill and fuck everything and buy nfts
[3:52:16] <Sonny_Firestorm> GO UP
[3:52:19] <%floornine> Make your OCs like Yamcha instead of Goku
[3:52:21] <@Jekado> i think there is an area thats good for leveling up skills near the tower elevator because it has a save point and some good mobs to kill
[3:52:22] <Saltmeisterr> i still think its funny that the creator of reize was super pissed of what they did to him in Specter or Torment
[3:52:23] <jmft2000> So thats why you choose to play like yourself
[3:52:24] <+Catpurnicus> look its chester from blloodborne
[3:52:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> oh wait, not yet
[3:52:31] <@Ranryu692> or rather, it was a binder of magic cards, rather than a spell book
[3:52:32] <FullMetalSnorlax> DO YOU?
[3:52:33] <Elykial> if my oc buys an nft im writing a story about them getting run over by a train
[3:52:36] <Sol_Install> fuck makinng a oc like yamacha
[3:52:37] <%Logoth_> Dig up
[3:52:42] <+Fooguwu> no just stand inside them it's sick
[3:52:44] <marvel877> I miss Rage. We needed to push him more, but he never truly got over like Zubaz did.
[3:52:45] <+Fooguwu> you're doing great
[3:52:46] <+twohitgood> i prefer no knockback. ü§∑
[3:52:47] <Zombrocom> Eh, but then you get knocked off a ledge and fall ten floors and it SUCKS
[3:52:48] <%RealThiele> classic mode says otherwise
[3:52:50] <MayShip> you do in the Rondo of Blood mode
[3:52:50] <Profmcstevie> Old games? You mean....just Sotn? Cos knockback I'm fairly sure is just Sotn
[3:52:54] <@Jekado> did pat just start from a new save?
[3:52:56] <TheSphereHunter> 639 raiders from TheSphereHunter have joined! 
[3:52:58] <Treasure_Vault> need morphball
[3:52:59] <+tempestzephyr> Time Stop

[3:53:21] <+Romeeo> WE COME FOR THE SPHERES
[3:53:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> You've been raided brother

[3:53:35] <Profmcstevie> @nansex specifically the igavanias we're mentioning
[3:53:38] <%Keyd00d> raid PogChamp
[3:53:42] <%andrewofbob> One thing I found refreshingly surprising in Freedom Planet is that enemies didn't just maim you on contact
[3:53:43] <Sonny_Firestorm> upper left
[3:53:43] <TheSphereHunter> thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB thesph1JillGOODJOB
[3:53:44] <Zombrocom> Oh jeez it's a raid
[3:53:45] <+Fooguwu> PAT CARES NOT FOR THE RAID
[3:53:48] <+BelricPsytar> pay the fuck attention pat
[3:53:50] <FullMetalSnorlax> there is only 2 of those cat enemies, and it has some great rare drops if you grind it.
[3:53:57] <+Fooguwu> PAT SEES ONLY VIOLENCE, NOT RAIDS
[3:53:58] <%Keyd00d> he's in gamer mode
[3:54:00] <MacMog> @leviting DNF Duel has characters, just without names. They should be made of blocks and spheres, no faces or voice acting or anything
[3:54:00] <Louie_Salmon> These stream has a big orb
[3:54:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey Sphere
[3:54:02] <malcobraaklynny> ngl I was saddened to learn that Miriam's horns were just a headpiece and not real horns
[3:54:02] <+Maleicus> my favorite part of this game was how easy it was to crash
[3:54:02] <nansex> @Profmcstevie he didn't specify igavania
[3:54:04] <TheSphereHunter> yea I really got stood up there huh
[3:54:11] <aeonicVector> @andrewofbob also some supers have iframes (like the cat's multikick)
[3:54:12] <@StridentSong> Sphere Hunter just raided you Pat
[3:54:18] <Stipli> In all fairness there was a cat on screen
[3:54:19] <+Fooguwu> Pat doesnt love you anymore suzi :(
[3:54:21] <%waltzqueen> @TheSphereHunter yeah, sorry bruh
[3:54:22] <+FingaLights> :(
[3:54:28] <TheSphereHunter> oh i raid
[3:54:34] <Profmcstevie> @nansex I assumed it was implied considering Castlevania classic is famous for it's knockback

[3:55:08] <+tempestzephyr> time is an illusion
[3:55:13] <%Keyd00d> Time is convoluted
[3:55:18] <Ipsenscastle> the lesson of this story is: never raid Pat
[3:55:23] <indig0bird> Does Bloodstained girl count as a Suzi character?
[3:55:32] <+Grayhammatter> gun go up
[3:55:33] <Stipli> time truly is an illusion
[3:55:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Time and Space is indeed convoluted in Montreal

[4:05:02] <+Fooguwu> MAKE ER TITS HUGE PATRICK
[4:05:02] <+pectusumbra> It used to just be color selections. honestly I kind of preferred it over the sliders as being a little less granular
[4:05:02] <+ArkadeNoah> Way better until you see the physics lmao
[4:05:07] <Elykial> was all this color stuff in the game at launch?
[4:05:08] <Ghostduck01> shadow the hedgehog hair style

[4:14:30] <+pectusumbra> also a good time to pick up more quests
[4:14:35] <%waltzqueen> @rasend0ri how much?
[4:14:41] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> God, I'm so happy this game's good.
[4:14:55] <+AlucardX60> Talk to the lady under the stairs Pat.
[4:14:57] <%Kaask> thats blue
[4:15:01] <MacMog> plant the 8-bit coin
[4:15:01] <+Maleicus> if only it didnt crash so much
[4:15:02] <+zal_silverfang> thats blue tho
[4:15:02] <%Dakuu75> wine red is the best color
[4:15:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because that Purple was ugly
[4:15:08] <+hush_wolf> @waltzqueen 16-17 usd i think
[4:15:10] <%waltzqueen> goth color schemes
[4:15:10] <@Jekado> WHAT IF IT WAS PURPLE
[4:15:10] <%rosysyntax> Pat loves "purple"
[4:15:11] <Mattais88> Royal Pat
[4:15:11] <+Grayhammatter> that's blue
[4:15:11] <%TheDullaMAN> Aesthetic
[4:15:14] <+pectusumbra> Both good colors
[4:15:19] <anAngryHamster> "purple"
[4:15:20] <+Sendrak70> The red you chose for FF14 is a more unique look than ever other purple based color scheme in that game.
[4:15:20] <%Broand> I too, like a good deep blue
[4:15:23] <Vashido22> KILL THOSE MURDERERS DEAD
[4:15:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so you're gonna use a blue dye then Kappa

[4:15:44] <Sypheck> is purple still your favorite color? khalaCreep
[4:15:45] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Alot of those names are Castlevania references
[4:15:45] <Sonny_Firestorm> This Lady is a representation of half the Castlevania fanbase towards Konami. KEKW
[4:15:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its ugly
[4:15:46] <+BelricPsytar> KILL

[4:15:55] <@Ranryu692> cassis
[4:15:56] <FullMetalSnorlax> the names of the people who died in these quests are special
[4:15:56] <@QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Man this sub baby is really gonna leave a wake of destruction when it finally busts out
[4:15:57] <+pectusumbra> yeah, bunch of castlevania references
[4:16:06] <DukeBeefhammer> I played this on switch at launch and I already can see a visual upgrade.
[4:16:07] <%Saadi90> I like grape purple in 14
[4:16:09] <%Rathalos2006> I just think Wine Red is a really nice shade in that game. Maybe it's the lighting or the shaders or something? It just looks good on  almost all materials.
[4:16:09] <%andrewofbob> They're dead because Konami
[4:16:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that is indeed a dark purple
[4:16:11] <%blistexthief> They're masterworks all, you can't go wrong
[4:16:12] <californaya> KILL THOSE MURDERERS DEAD
[4:16:12] <%CalderGaming> kill konami dead

[4:16:16] <hakumaribo> wait which 8 bit weapon did you make?
[4:16:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> The other quest giver too
[4:16:17] <+hush_wolf> i am the revenge merchant, watttaya buyin?
[4:16:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do they have a monster named konami?
[4:16:22] <danteftw20> AVENGE THEM PATT!
[4:16:23] <+ocelotshotfirst> Oh they fuckin'
[4:16:23] <FullMetalSnorlax> they live on in netflix
[4:16:23] <%Valdorick> Something tells me this lady wants you to kill those murderers dead.
[4:16:28] <+Netgearer22> There is straight up a secret Simon boss in this game btw
[4:16:30] <scrumbotime> grape purple goes good with gold
[4:16:32] <%moonmintparadise> grey purple is really good but gold purple is much better
[4:16:33] <worldbrand> a currant is a grapelike berry innit?
[4:16:35] <PanicSwytch> I like burgundy
[4:16:42] <%asakura_ayase> Rolandberry red is good
[4:16:42] <indig0bird> Dark Purple?
[4:16:45] <+FingaLights> Castlevania is dead
[4:16:47] <%Broand> What flavour are the purple skittles in Canada?
[4:16:50] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I like miilioncorn yellow because it makes armor look like gold
[4:16:51] <MacMog> you have to be cruel to be kind
[4:16:53] <indig0bird> It's one of the cheapest General Purpose
[4:16:54] <MillaMoks> worse than pure white dye?
[4:16:56] <T_Sasquatch> Dark purple may as well be black in ffxiv
[4:16:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that just looks like an off black
[4:16:58] <%Dakuu75> aren't all the expensive dyes like, a dollar in the shop?
[4:17:03] <%BlackMage66652> @PatStaresAt My Chocobo is Grape Purple
[4:17:04] <hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt which 8 bit weapon did you make?
[4:17:04] <%rosysyntax> black currant jam is delicious
[4:17:06] <%JoshManVGH> Hey they fixed the SMN Boots! They are dyeable now!
[4:17:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> maple syrup purple
[4:17:15] <+pectusumbra> supposedly konami is working on a castlevania now but I BIG DOUBT taht
[4:17:16] <@Ranryu692> I must get my hands on those healthy purpleberries
[4:17:16] <%waltzqueen> like kool-aid
[4:17:19] <%Broand> I ask because it's not grape in europe
[4:17:20] <fuji_n2> purple flavor
[4:17:21] <Profmcstevie> All skittles are flavoured equally
[4:17:26] <Mattais88> Banana, like all pruple things are, why?
[4:17:28] <%TimetodiveLTX> purple goated
[4:17:30] <hakumaribo> yeah 8 bit coin weapons are busted
[4:17:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> Other quest-giver have anything?
[4:17:36] <%Bluwizard21> "super powerful"
[4:17:36] <+Grayhammatter> WHOA
[4:17:36] <+Netgearer22> backer weapons
[4:17:36] <+pectusumbra> You basically get 1 for a long time
[4:17:41] <+Sendrak70> They arnt that powerful. They get scaled out mid-game.
[4:17:41] <%waltzqueen> fun over balance
[4:17:48] <fuji_n2> this is the weak version tho
[4:17:48] <+leviting> I love purple flavored junk food
[4:17:49] <+anoldtoilet> theyre Okay weapons
[4:17:51] <brunoberserk> is fun being overpower
[4:17:55] <fuji_n2> I think
[4:17:57] <%TimetodiveLTX> @Sendrak70 this was my experience as well
[4:17:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> YEUP

[4:18:07] <KenzBurp> the green ones are still lime in the UK and that makes me mad.  get this green apple shit out of here
[4:18:10] <+Catpurnicus> yep thats the tradeoff
[4:18:20] <tattleworm> i think encrypted orchid had a special but i forget the input
[4:18:21] <MacMog> show me ya moves
[4:18:24] <+pectusumbra> also if I remember right, the demon shard is a passive int up, if you want to be more casty
[4:18:25] <+Sendrak70> @TimetodiveLTX The flying sword is where I spent a lot of my time. Also upgraded the crap out of it.
[4:18:32] <FullMetalSnorlax> the cat enemy has some good drops, you only find it twice in the game
[4:18:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt 8bit weapons are for bosses or "I don't want to bohter with this area" runs
[4:18:47] <%TimetodiveLTX> i just used whips and jump cancelled my landings a lot
[4:18:56] <hakumaribo> new hair cut
[4:18:58] <tattleworm> new hairstyle unlocked
[4:18:58] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt These barbers drop this game's equivalent of Castlevania's Vorpal Blade. (yes, you use these to craft the Not-Crissaegrim)

[4:25:50] <Treasure_Vault> ohhhh
[4:25:52] <fuji_n2> ooooooooooh
[4:25:57] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt when you see a bookshelf next to the entrance to a room it usually means a saverrom
[4:25:57] <+pectusumbra> it's been a WHILE, but this game does stick, particularly for the farming points
[4:26:00] <+rasend0ri> All Chat Are Bastard
[4:26:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> Crazy Talk at it again?
[4:26:04] <+re_double> save room restores magix
[4:26:08] <%RealThiele> GUN
[4:26:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> yknow an under desk pedal machine goes great with RPG grinding

[4:26:55] <+pectusumbra> also familiars do stuff while you are sitting I believe
[4:26:56] <+Pixel_Matt> Pog
[4:26:57] <+hush_wolf> sick! magic sword
[4:27:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Now you got the SOTN Sword
[4:27:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> Unequip familiar to equiip sword
[4:27:04] <%RealThiele> now get 8 more LUL
[4:27:07] <kinkade_77> sword famililars r the coolest
[4:27:11] <+CherteuseKapibara> summon sword :)
[4:27:13] <@Ranryu692> you can't equip it as a familiar and a weapon at the same time
[4:27:14] <tattleworm> as the familiar levels, the sword gets stronger and changes visual, it's super cool
[4:27:14] <artoflec> some of them do
[4:27:17] <fuji_n2> it gets stronger if the familiar lvls up
[4:27:18] <+hush_wolf> idle or on the couch?
[4:27:21] <+AlucardX60> You can't equip the sword if you have it out as a familiar.
[4:27:37] <%bevyrage> no pat just use REMOVE
[4:27:37] <fuji_n2> remove pat
[4:27:38] <%Mendin> Up one for Remove
[4:27:41] <Sonny_Firestorm> You can REMOVE it
[4:27:42] <%Treuan> The top option was remove, not back
[4:27:43] <Zombrocom> ...Did you not see the remove option?
[4:27:49] <Vashido22> remove
[4:27:51] <+BelricPsytar> pat....are you blind?
[4:27:55] <%bevyrage> pat has been very blind this stream
[4:27:59] <%RealThiele> big blind
[4:28:01] <Profmcstevie> Exceptionally blind today aren't we
[4:28:08] <+BelricPsytar> BLIND
[4:28:11] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Pat is having a really bad time with menus today huh
[4:28:15] <+re_double> as a familiar he will grew into a stronger literal weapon
[4:28:20] <%andrewofbob> So, I fired up the Switch version. I does indeed have all the new features. It also still farts a consistent 30 fps, and has NEW COMPLIANCE VOIDING GRAPHICAL GLITCHES
[4:28:25] <tattleworm> but it won't level if you're using it as a weapon, sadly
[4:28:28] <FullMetalSnorlax> its not a great weapon
[4:28:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gotta use it as a familiar to level it
[4:28:33] <+AlucardX60> The weapon gets stronger as the familiar does.
[4:28:34] <marvel877> Paige needs to order glasses for herself AND Pat.
[4:28:37] <%TheDullaMAN> Level it up as a Familiar, it gets stronger as a Weapon
[4:28:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> Last time I played it only levels when used as Familiar.
[4:28:39] <fuji_n2> Max as a familiar first
[4:28:47] <+PJSmooth> Yeah let him be a familiar till it maxes out
[4:28:47] <+pectusumbra> so you farm the shards and it makes the sword stronger
[4:28:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @andrewofbob oh shit like what kind of glitches?
[4:28:47] <%RealThiele> its a boring straight sword
[4:28:52] <%livlinn> livlinn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! 20 month in 2022. Wish you the happiest hypest New Years Pat and chat!
[4:28:52] <Sonny_Firestorm> It gets stronger and it's appearance changes.
[4:28:53] <Zombrocom> Really no reason to use it as a weapon but its there
[4:28:58] <GeneralHysterics> SPIDERTRON?
[4:28:59] <tattleworm> capped out it's probably the second strongest weapon in the game
[4:29:00] <%orbulon> a shame you dont have a GIANT HAND, oh the things you could do with a GIANT HAND
[4:29:02] <+hush_wolf> that animation made me dizzy
[4:29:05] <Vashido22> oh look a GIANT HAND
[4:29:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ZA HANDO
[4:29:08] <%RealThiele> ART

[4:29:15] <+GenesysCreed> BOSS FIGHT
[4:29:15] <%UvBenServed> psaFist psaFist psaFist
[4:29:22] <Profmcstevie> ZA HANDO
[4:29:22] <MacMog> an E.M.M.I.?! Here?!
[4:29:24] <+Netgearer22> fun fact, if you beat bosses in this game without taking damage, you get rewarded with a special emblem
[4:29:28] <Magick_Man> FLIK
[4:29:29] <Zourath> Imagine what you could do with it!
[4:29:29] <%andrewofbob> @andrewofbob Quite reliably a lot of the screen just flashes a bright colour for one frame
[4:29:29] <SaltyAzteca> FLICKED
[4:29:29] <%StephanieSadGirl> It has a mouth ITS A MIMIC
[4:29:31] <+izanagi22> Catholic Hand
[4:29:35] <Reanimator83> Did Paige order her glasses?
[4:29:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat loves the knockback, he said so
[4:29:37] <%livlinn> spaceyeenBeans
[4:29:41] <DejaraUndead> Giant Enemy Crab Hand
[4:29:43] <%RealThiele> art mimic aye
[4:29:47] <Ghostduck01> LUL
[4:29:49] <+Grayhammatter> oh fuck
[4:29:56] <Anderobot> Lmao the contact damage
[4:29:57] <@Jekado> oh right the weird HAND boss
[4:29:58] <+FingaLights> Giant Hand, makes ALL of Da rules
[4:29:58] <SaltyAzteca> Contact damage sucks!
[4:29:58] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat, look out, it's a giant hand
[4:30:00] <+Pars_Librum> Pat, food is absolutely shit for healing, just a warning
[4:30:01] <+re_double> time to die
[4:30:02] <zodiark26> that healed nothing
[4:30:05] <+pectusumbra> maybe a longer range weapon?
[4:30:06] <%StephanieSadGirl> Its the ghost of all of Paige's destroyed and lost glasses!
[4:30:08] <%rosysyntax> This is why we heal.
[4:30:09] <mczarklesby> Well, you gotta hand it to the devs.
[4:30:10] <BraxtonSwine> atpCap
[4:30:11] <%Broand> giant hands?
[4:30:13] <terrible35> I hate giant hands?
[4:30:14] <+Fooguwu> dagger bad
[4:30:15] <%livlinn> HEALTH
[4:30:21] <fuji_n2> yeah dagger is kinda oof
[4:30:29] <supakaminarikun> use weapon with better range
[4:30:31] <@Jekado> is Miriam gonna be in Smash sofarfThink
[4:30:31] <pixelkenj> you mean the entire game?
[4:30:32] <+tempestzephyr> get a longer weapon then
[4:30:32] <%studleydoorite> I can accept stained glass master hand boss but why does it have teeth
[4:30:33] <%TimetodiveLTX> contact damage more like contact dumbage
[4:30:37] <%rosysyntax> Having no knockback does suck. This is why I stuck with longer range stuff.
[4:30:38] <+Kodkiro> Pat how are you doing
[4:30:39] <+Cameony> it's bad but it's fun to use
[4:30:40] <%livlinn> kiichiTooth
[4:30:46] <FullMetalSnorlax> this is def a boss you should be able to stand on.
[4:30:47] <Sonny_Firestorm> First few levels are freebies.
[4:30:50] <Joru_Brun> I hate the painting in this area.
[4:30:52] <%TheDullaMAN> Right
[4:30:52] <%Bluwizard21> as long as they have a reason for contact damage I'm cool with them, but for them to just walk into u and do tons of damage for no reason is ridiculous
[4:30:54] <fuji_n2> at the start ye
[4:31:02] <+ocelotshotfirst> Familiars have levels.
[4:31:03] <tattleworm> rank is dupes, grade is upgrading with johanes i think?
[4:31:08] <tattleworm> maybe the other way around
[4:31:09] <Sonny_Firestorm> Grade and Rank don't do a whole lot anymore. Got nerfed after people complained about one that you can't farm freely.
[4:31:10] <+Fooguwu> It also has folds and megacrunches
[4:31:11] <Treasure_Vault> and spheres and dynes and ascensions
[4:31:19] <%livlinn> Bork psaDogchamp
[4:31:33] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp psaMenace psaMenace
[4:31:36] <%BlackMage66652> borgor
[4:31:51] <%LowSkillGod> it looks like pat is using kinda a shitty dagger, why is that?
[4:31:54] <%shurtal> cleansing the boy?
[4:32:09] <$LowSkillGod> !dog cleansed!
[4:32:12] <%livlinn> Gief is protecting the staircase
[4:32:23] <+Cameony> I'd say a giant monster hand made of broken glass against a not-so-modestly-dressed human would be a decent reason for contact damage. The other monsters, not so much
[4:32:40] <+Fooguwu> ow!
[4:33:02] <+Dova573> La mano Pachona
[4:33:02] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:33:24] <%LowSkillGod> contact damage in modern games really screws with me
[4:33:31] <PizzicatoFive5> any link to the discord?
[4:33:38] <MacMog> all monsters, like Goombas and Koopa Troopas, bathe in contact poison
[4:33:38] <Ultralazuli> sword puttin in work

[4:33:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> rip upper room
[4:33:55] <+pectusumbra> gjo
[4:33:56] <+Cameony> I hate contact damage, especially when you don't have too much ability to get away
[4:33:58] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Does Zangief still hate the lipstick monkey?
[4:34:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> he used the throw twice
[4:34:01] <stranger59> Give Pat a hand!
[4:34:05] <LeafarOz> master hand looks different
[4:34:06] <%orbulon> a shame you dont have a GIANT HAND, oh the things you could do with a GIANT HAND
[4:34:08] <FullMetalSnorlax> GIVE HIM A HAND EVERYBODDY!
[4:34:09] <+Cameony> death's door doesn't have it though which is nice
[4:34:14] <supakaminarikun> GAMER
[4:34:15] <Gregorhasjoined> Good job Familiar
[4:34:16] <@Jekado> @Top_Lane_Duelist yee it talks
[4:34:21] <%FacetiousAF> FacetiousAF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! i think game is good and i'm happy to see you play it

[4:34:57] <+pectusumbra> ?
[4:35:00] <+re_double> what
[4:35:04] <%LowSkillGod> ?
[4:35:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> yep, you need to kill the boss before he can throw the second stone thingy

[4:35:32] <Vashido22> killing it just means you get it earlier
[4:35:36] <zodiark26> one guy
[4:35:38] <+N0ZZ45> just go back and save and it'll be there
[4:35:38] <+Catpurnicus> its just a sequence break
[4:35:42] <+izanagi22> Bloodbringer's cooler anyway imo
[4:35:42] <%RealThiele> later
[4:35:42] <+pectusumbra> Oh, I remember! It's another familiar, silver knight or something
[4:35:44] <+Pars_Librum> I can't really think of anything that is super time locked in this

[4:42:52] <%0dinpen> am I in time for the mindgoblins? How long as pat been on this screen LUL
[4:42:56] <+pectusumbra> It's weird, they were in the game before and got replaced with the sliders!
[4:42:56] <fuji_n2> same
[4:42:57] <+re_double> I think there were and this the update LUL
[4:42:58] <FullMetalSnorlax> the funny thing is, there was ONLY preselectable colours at launch
[4:43:00] <%DashXero> I could have sworn there used to be.
[4:43:00] <tattleworm> there used to be! it was updated to be more customisable
[4:43:00] <+AlucardX60> There were presets but then they changed it to a wheel.
[4:43:00] <kinkade_77> i like color sliders
[4:43:05] <%LowSkillGod> what is he going for here? is it a reference to another character or just the vibes Pat likes
[4:43:06] <+Fooguwu> but waifu customization must be detailed pat
[4:43:10] <MacMog> give me glamor plates in every game
[4:43:10] <marvel877> there were.
[4:43:14] <Profmcstevie> Always have both
[4:43:43] <%RealThiele> dog respects reading
[4:43:45] <FullMetalSnorlax> FYI the flying kicks allow many sequnece breaks
[4:43:48] <+pectusumbra> I did like boots as well from time to time
[4:43:51] <+Joe2187> Use the kung fu boots
[4:43:53] <%FacetiousAF> wait isn't there supposed to be a breakdance after she lands the dropkick?
[4:44:04] <%LaughingCatt> they are
[4:44:05] <+SargentToughie> It's kind of insane how good they are, actually
[4:44:05] <+justianxix> ye
[4:44:06] <MaybeFalco> they are
[4:44:06] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat they're pretty nice
[4:44:06] <MacMog> if I make an appearance I like, let me save it as a preset so I can experiment without fear of losing the cool thing
[4:44:06] <+kyokadesuu> Meh they're not my thing
[4:44:06] <%Agami23> yeyeye
[4:44:08] <%CalderGaming> monstrorum? matter of taste
[4:44:08] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah

[4:44:12] <dinnydanny777> Ooo
[4:44:12] <%Flightedwings> I agree the weapons look great
[4:44:14] <%Rathalos2006> Yeah, they're cool. I got the axe last week and I love it
[4:44:15] <@QueequegTheater> YE
[4:44:19] <%Valdorick> Yes
[4:44:21] <%LaughingCatt> got the scythe & havent used anything else for Reaper since
[4:44:21] <%Alazull> Yeah
[4:44:22] <%Agami23> but they are black and purple. so of course they look amazing
[4:44:26] <%kainhighwind1990> you talking about the 81 dungeon weapons?
[4:44:27] <%RealThiele> id say most of the 81-87 gear is great this time
[4:44:27] <%Saadi90> Yeah they cool
[4:44:33] <Sonny_Firestorm> I dunno man, all I know about FF14 is that unholy amalgamation from the Nier collab.
[4:44:33] <%DianaTheAscian> they look better than any of the arr primal stuff
[4:44:41] <+BrightSol> Are they technically a primal set tho? :D
[4:44:41] <ne0bunny> I love the lv87 dungeon smn book
[4:44:47] <dinnydanny777> cool music
[4:44:57] <donstylo> I think the Lv. 85 Dungeon has one of the best looking Armors in the game i think.
[4:45:02] <FullMetalSnorlax> Wow look at pat's new haircut and breakdancing skills
[4:45:07] <%Alazull> Do it coward
[4:45:16] <%waltzqueen> that moon looks healthy

[4:45:32] <dinnydanny777> You could be really good at Basketball :O
[4:45:36] <%TheDullaMAN> Remember the Iron Maiden?
[4:45:37] <%kainhighwind1990> RELEASE TOAD IS AMAZING
[4:45:37] <FullMetalSnorlax> REALESE THE TOAD
[4:45:38] <%PMAvers> I don't think I've actually seen a weapon drop out of there other than the scythe or maybe the scholar book, it's always one of those two.
[4:45:40] <codizle> Bigby's Hand
[4:45:41] <%LowSkillGod> UNLOAD YOUR TOAD
[4:45:46] <Profmcstevie> Not summon, RELEASE
[4:45:52] <%whyskeywolfe> Of course a giant hand for Pat is just a regular hand for us.
[4:45:53] <MacMog> pushing with your body is useless, must use Master Hand
[4:45:54] <%0dinpen> unbench the kench?
[4:45:56] <%Blank9> anima weapon summoner book is the only summoner weapon for me
[4:46:08] <@QueequegTheater> Once I have the full HQ crafting/gathering sets, do I just farm scrips for materia until I have them all pentamelded?

[4:46:51] <indig0bird> I'm disappointed at weapons that get much smaller when sheathed
[4:46:55] <%DianaTheAscian> can you get different outfits or is it just all head stuff
[4:46:55] <+brave_sj> Why is the hog so powerful
[4:46:55] <%Rathalos2006> You can probably use that Kick combo in the air to cover more distance than you're supposed to at this point? Sequence break with it maybe?
[4:46:57] <%TheDullaMAN> Congrats, you're Cammy now
[4:46:58] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So does...pat have a hat fetish or his he just a hat fan?

[4:47:07] <pixelkenj> This is a hazy memory, but have you tried using the heel tech in the air?
[4:47:16] <dinnydanny777> The Coachman is so nice
[4:47:26] <+tempestzephyr> Hazanshu
[4:47:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Wait, is that a Battle Tendency reference?

[4:49:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> grinding the materials to level everything is hell.

[4:50:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> Did you guys make him hold Up yet?
[4:50:33] <cheapdoc> You having a good time Pat?
[4:51:00] <SaltyAzteca> YOU WILL BE COLLECTING FOR A LONG, LONG TIME
[4:51:07] <s1rcuit> is he accepting quests from the other lady? the one in the same screen as the farmer?
[4:51:09] <%Nekros4442> the black/purple glowy weaps?
[4:51:09] <+pectusumbra> @EngiNierXII It's good if a bit jank, but if you like the iga-vania castlevanias it's for you
[4:51:11] <@Ranryu692> @Sonny_Firestorm it was one of the first things he did
[4:51:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> @EngiNierXII If you wanted a new Symphony of the Night, then yes it's everything we wanted.
[4:51:17] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat did you already get all the 83 dungeon outfits?
[4:51:20] <T_Sasquatch> They're cool but i don't recall loving then THAT much
[4:51:21] <%baka_sugoi> the JAPANESE MAN
[4:51:22] <+FingaLights> @EngiNierXII Very good IgaVania, If you like the handheld CastleVania or SOTN, you probably will like it
[4:51:35] <stranger59> I should finish up Blasphemous and then this.
[4:51:40] <%Blank9> I need to do 81 over and over again just to get the minion
[4:51:52] <moopycat> Boobs
[4:51:54] <$The_Angry_God_Hoogs> I deleted my trial ff14. It didn't really do it for me.
[4:52:04] <inksmears> nope
[4:52:05] <%watts121> best looking weapons imo are lvl 87 dungeon
[4:52:07] <inksmears> not sellable
[4:52:09] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt I did Frontlines to get a pistol for a glam...only to realize the 87 dungeon dropped a MCH pistol with almost the exact same model
[4:52:11] <donstylo> Pat, what do you think about the Lv. 85 Dungeon gear?
[4:52:12] <gan_n_dorf> I have a lot of hours in this game, thanks to the randomizer mode
[4:52:14] <indig0bird> The lvl 88 crafted weapons share their model with the lvl 83 ones
[4:52:14] <%SwdVengeance> Nope, it's BoP
[4:52:17] <%JoshManVGH> Time to grind!
[4:52:19] <%orbulon> no, trust me ive ran it many times
[4:52:22] <SaltyAzteca> No thats a normal castle Miriam
[4:52:25] <stranger59> Everyone in Hell is taller
[4:52:27] <+NecDW4> Not sure if you caught this, since i had to step out for a bit, but the first time you eat a food you get a  permanent stat increase, so its worth it to grind out the recipes
[4:52:28] <%Mathochism> I play Dancer. All of our weapons except the Lvl 89 one is trash.
[4:52:30] <Danitaras> nope you have to suffer grind
[4:52:37] <+hush_wolf> hahahah
[4:52:38] <stranger59> Slut gear
[4:52:40] <Zebylth> good
[4:52:41] <scrumbotime> oh now pat doesn't want slutpants
[4:52:41] <%DianaTheAscian> so it's perfect
[4:52:42] <dinnydanny777> that's bad...?

[4:52:44] <Vashido22> you say it like its a bad thing
[4:52:45] <gunstars20> LUL
[4:52:46] <+Fooguwu> hell yes
[4:52:47] <SunjammerIV> slut shaming

[4:52:48] <+tempestzephyr> embrace slut
[4:52:48] <%tinyswampthing> awesome
[4:52:48] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[4:52:49] <%Archmortal> I rolled an 89 and wasn't even the second highest roll on it so now I'm spite-farming it
[4:52:51] <+JustToWatch> But Pat you are a slut
[4:52:52] <theshillman> but thats good
[4:52:52] <FullMetalSnorlax> "i consider myself to be a pretty high jumper" is an understatment when you can jump 10 feet
[4:52:52] <fuji_n2> as you should
[4:52:55] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Are any of the Berserk video games any good? I just started reading it recently and I love it
[4:52:55] <kingra> The belly is the most erotic part of the human
[4:53:00] <+hush_wolf> middriff hussy
[4:53:02] <%MisterRockett> You.... DON'T like that?
[4:53:03] <%MidnightPacif1c> well there's a distinct lack of slut wear so
[4:53:03] <@QueequegTheater> Why us that bad?
[4:53:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> He does.
[4:53:07] <EngiNierXII> I wanna love the 85 stuff but the pants and shirts are like... weird.
[4:53:08] <ne0bunny> bun bois are sluts
[4:53:08] <%JoshManVGH> I like some of the mods to the 87 gear. But I miss the color.
[4:53:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> oh my god david hayter's in this
[4:53:10] <+Plus_On_Black> Damn, let me be a slutt.
[4:53:11] <dinnydanny777> Dominique's thighs are so large üò≥
[4:53:12] <%TimetodiveLTX> i totally forgot
[4:53:17] <%JoshManVGH> Weapons are cool though
[4:53:24] <kinkade_77> some sort of........... double jump
[4:53:25] <Treasure_Vault> what a nerd, just call it a library
[4:53:26] <+SargentToughie> "I want the cool powerup, though!"
[4:53:28] <%Archmortal> you want your pants to go OVER your belly button?
[4:53:30] <SaltyAzteca> YOUD LEARN TO SKELLY BLAZE
[4:53:33] <EngiNierXII> I wish the 89 dungeon dropped gear.
[4:53:35] <SunjammerIV> dominique's lots of things are so large
[4:53:36] <KenzBurp> crystal....exarch
[4:53:38] <DirtyMiser> @kainhighwind1990 Technically Dragon's Dogma is a dope Berserk game
[4:53:41] <MacMog> screw physics, just jump in midair
[4:53:47] <%watts121> I can't wait till female hrothgar come out so I can finally play a girl with hairy pits.
[4:53:51] <Bakafied> Yoooo I love this game.
[4:53:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Get more waystones. They're great
[4:53:52] <+SargentToughie> I actually love the way that the characters just nakedly talk about the video game mechanics
[4:53:52] <+Fooguwu> JO crystals
[4:53:54] <SunjammerIV> i think pat is trying to describe lowrider pants
[4:53:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Coins can be purchased, but you can also get them as drops somewhere.
[4:54:01] <+thesubgenius91> please tell me zangief had boots for the polar vortex!
[4:54:09] <%TheDullaMAN> Try and upgrade your shards, too Pat.
[4:54:09] <Ultralazuli> you can fuze the shards

[4:54:38] <+brave_sj> HOG
[4:54:38] <+Fooguwu> upgrade your shids and fards
[4:54:40] <%LowSkillGod> PORK ENHANCEMENT
[4:54:43] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Upgrading pig gives you more pigs when you summon
[4:54:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Passive Shards become permanent at Rank 9
[4:54:47] <gan_n_dorf> I play on Crystal and queue hasn't been a thing for a week or so
[4:54:48] <%LowSkillGod> HOG GO UP
[4:54:52] <donstylo> My favorite Gear is the Lv. 90 Tombstone one for Reaper Combined with the Dreadwyrm gear you look like a Dynasty Warriors character.
[4:54:52] <+pectusumbra> pig or int passive
[4:54:54] <+Fooguwu> heretical grinder for sure
[4:54:54] <%TheDullaMAN> Most shard material is dropped from the monster it came from?
[4:54:55] <@Ranryu692> upgrade the pig with pig meat
[4:54:56] <+izanagi22> Grinder for DPS?
[4:54:57] <%waltzqueen> porked up

[4:55:05] <%RealThiele> yeyeye
[4:55:05] <fuji_n2> PIG UP
[4:55:07] <+FingaLights> Slap pig with pork, make it stronger
[4:55:07] <FullMetalSnorlax> they are usually upgraded by tems the mosnter also drops, which is pretty redundant
[4:55:10] <MacMog> @xen0riddley depends heavily on which server and when you want to log in
[4:55:12] <gan_n_dorf> increase the pork
[4:55:15] <+pectusumbra> yeah, the pig stays out longer
[4:55:16] <+Pars_Librum> @PatStaresAt Can bounce around more
[4:55:16] <+twohitgood> duration of how long pig is on screen.
[4:55:17] <lloyddboy> PORK UP
[4:55:19] <+re_double> enhancing pork with some salt I see lionNice
[4:55:21] <+brave_sj> Hog Eternal
[4:55:25] <%FacetiousAF> i really really really liked summon bat
[4:55:28] <%kainhighwind1990> wait no I had a brain fart I was thinking of something else
[4:55:29] <%RealThiele> more bounces
[4:55:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> sure you like Ham, but if it's so good, how come you can't upgrade it to Ham 2
[4:55:37] <%epide> i always say upgrade the starter water one it gets more bonces and damage
[4:55:41] <MacMog> humongous pig
[4:55:41] <%Jhylla81> Some shards look different when you upgrade them
[4:55:43] <%orbulon> much more pig
[4:55:43] <fuji_n2> Max rank does something better I'd guess, but idk
[4:55:45] <+blue_twitch> "if you encounter him, make sure to bail"
[4:55:45] <+xen0riddley> @MacMog well, I'm 2nd shift, so I can only do it in early morning, or at like 1am for a an hour or two LUL
[4:55:53] <gan_n_dorf> pig is great when you need to conserve mp
[4:55:55] <+Hellarussian> evil will always triumph because good is dumb
[4:55:57] <%RealThiele> Hamaga
[4:56:00] <%orbulon> @blue_twitch nice
[4:56:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> There's really only 1 attack shard you need to break this game: TEPS OCEUS
[4:56:07] <%baka_sugoi> F E E T
[4:56:09] <cheapdoc> Foot stuff
[4:56:09] <pixelkenj> careful with that phrase
[4:56:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> the foot stuff
[4:56:10] <%watts121> kick gurl Mirriam is the best
[4:56:11] <+FingaLights> Hmm, is bacon Ham 2?
[4:56:11] <+Fooguwu> phrasing
[4:56:13] <+justianxix> wording
[4:56:13] <+Pars_Librum> Pat, no
[4:56:15] <@Ranryu692> Pat's starting to see the appeal of foot stuff
[4:56:15] <+Catpurnicus> yeah the boots are the best weapon
[4:56:16] <+TheBitingIrish> Kappa
[4:56:17] <fuji_n2> big combos
[4:56:19] <MacMog> @xen0riddley yeah, after midnight ET I usually get in after a minute or three
[4:56:23] <cheapdoc> PAT YES
[4:56:23] <+theenigmaticdude> she's like Cammy
[4:56:42] <+pectusumbra> there are plenty of fairies if you want her
[4:56:46] <Sonny_Firestorm> there's more of them up ahead
[4:56:51] <FrostedZaibatsu> I remember farming this spot too much
[4:56:51] <+CherteuseKapibara> OW
[4:56:54] <DXLelouch24> i mean for all we know Pat does have a foot fetish and hes just lying about it
[4:56:54] <+Fooguwu> i remember these fairies drop something good
[4:56:58] <anAngryHamster> Shine
[4:56:59] <+twohitgood> you do want fairy dust
[4:57:01] <DXLelouch24> no way to know
[4:57:03] <+brave_sj> @patstaresat Does living in a place where a lot of people speak French make the language less hot?
[4:57:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> Fairy: "ACH! FUCK JESUS"
[4:57:11] <%twistedj3ster> pat stop slapping that girl with your bloated hog
[4:57:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> You need the pork for something too
[4:57:17] <+tempestzephyr> pat's killing little anime girls
[4:57:17] <%RealThiele> pure fairy dust uncut
[4:57:17] <kingra> Bullying fairies :(
[4:57:21] <%cartakus> Still going strong?
[4:57:31] <+xen0riddley> oh yeah, the game can have some massive grind...
[4:57:33] <@Ranryu692> Quebecois French was never hot anyway
[4:57:36] <+twohitgood> familiarity breeds contempt
[4:57:39] <+brave_sj> What a loss
[4:57:40] <+pectusumbra> the special thing about the fairy familiar is that it has special heal items that it can use on it's own to heal you
[4:57:41] <%baka_sugoi> oui oui
[4:57:42] <%Agami23> is there a language you find hot?
[4:57:46] <%DianaTheAscian> languages aren't hot but accents are
[4:57:46] <%Broand> Oh wow oooh la la
[4:57:48] <DXLelouch24> its not a grind if its fun
[4:57:51] <%Keyd00d> pat is attracted to the southern drawl
[4:57:52] <%orbulon> the appeal is more of the french accent anyway
[4:57:52] <%StephanieSadGirl> If french is so hot explain why everyone here doesnt cum in their pants when Pat speaks french?
[4:57:54] <%TheDullaMAN> A little further ahead is a better grinding spot.
[4:57:55] <%Ne1son> Thats Canadian French though
[4:57:55] <+pectusumbra> otherwise I don't like it much myself
[4:57:58] <%Axellogic> French always sounds like someone is about to spit in my ear
[4:58:03] <+tempestzephyr> CUM
[4:58:03] <Sonny_Firestorm> there's more up ahead
[4:58:05] <Ipsenscastle> Diana gets it
[4:58:08] <+Fooguwu> cum
[4:58:09] <+xen0riddley> what about german?  Is that a better language than french?
[4:58:10] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt CAN YOU GUESS WHICH ONE
[4:58:10] <%cartakus> Nothing is hotter than germans screaming at the top of their lungs
[4:58:15] <SunjammerIV> i grew up west canada french immersion school and that made me associate french with raging psychopathic middle aged teachers exported from quebec
[4:58:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> couple more = quite a few several
[4:58:17] <cheapdoc> There's gonna be a ton of fairies, you don't need to grind them right now
[4:58:18] <%whyskeywolfe> eeyaAAAaaaAAA
[4:58:22] <FullMetalSnorlax> equip luck item

[4:58:47] <FullMetalSnorlax> if you have the faiiry hwere it sings
[4:58:48] <+xen0riddley> a kindly old german lady could be saying kind things to you, and it'll sound like she's going to stab you

[4:58:51] <@GeneralSCPatton> If you have the pixie, she sings here
[4:58:52] <PanicSwytch> I love this song
[4:58:52] <Anderobot> Get the fairy shard and sit at the piano for better music
[4:58:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> now do this, but with a fairy
[4:58:56] <%whyskeywolfe> Some companions react to the piano differently.
[4:58:56] <%Animatic_> the fairies do fight back.
[4:58:59] <+brave_sj> You should try this with the fairy familiar
[4:59:02] <fuji_n2> fairy does a thing here too yeah
[4:59:03] <%RealThiele> PLAY FREEBIRD
[4:59:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> This is the main menu theme actually.

[4:59:26] <%cartakus> Why is pat commiting genocide against farries?
[4:59:27] <%TheDullaMAN> Going across the top leads to recipes.
[4:59:29] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt I'M SICK OF THIS CRAMPED OLD CASTLE, LET'S PLAY IN THE FOREST
[4:59:31] <+Kodkiro> chat what jrpg should i look forward to this new year
[4:59:34] <dinnydanny777> That's like, the Mario/Link kick in Smash
[4:59:35] <@Ranryu692> excuse me, they're dagger feet
[4:59:37] <gan_n_dorf> "hello, 911, my feet are knives"
[4:59:43] <Ipsenscastle> Wolverfeet
[4:59:48] <%cartakus> Elden Ring
[4:59:48] <+xen0riddley> @Kodkiro Project Eve
[4:59:49] <%Axellogic> I wish the game had less quarter circles
[5:00:02] <cheapdoc> The sword summon is so funny
[5:00:04] <SunjammerIV> @Kodkiro sea of stars
[5:00:09] <FullMetalSnorlax> @Axellogic what you prefer pretzle motions?
[5:00:12] <%Logoth_> Do you eventually get laser feet?
[5:00:17] <+pectusumbra> beware the right!
[5:00:20] <+xen0riddley> @SunjammerIV so excited for that.  backed it on KS
[5:00:33] <%DianaTheAscian> quarter circles are super easy though
[5:00:33] <%TheDullaMAN> You hit the wrong part of the wall on the left.
[5:00:41] <+xen0riddley> beware the random battle!
[5:00:45] <%Axellogic> @Axellogic I prefer less complicated inputs for basic actions like a block/parry
[5:00:51] <%Animatic_> gun up
[5:00:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yes LUL
[5:01:00] <cheapdoc> Did anyone use guns in bloodstained?
[5:01:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> knife kick the curtain wraith with the help of your bloated pig
[5:01:10] <+pectusumbra> also you can go down that well she's guarding
[5:01:12] <Sonny_Firestorm> @cheapdoc I did
[5:01:13] <Vashido22> yeah, guns are great

[5:01:18] <+blue_twitch> @Kodkiro eiyuden chronicle: rising
[5:01:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> Guns are killjoy.
[5:01:31] <+Grayhammatter> go piggy go!
[5:01:32] <Sonny_Firestorm> They trivialize everything.
[5:01:32] <+pectusumbra> and this is where I farmed her shard
[5:01:32] <%NopeBadguy> just got back, how's your technique progress?
[5:01:34] <pixelkenj> behold the pig room
[5:01:34] <FullMetalSnorlax> @cheapdoc yes they are broken. make the whole game a joke
[5:01:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Guns are busted good, especially once you get some ammo
[5:01:37] <SaltyAzteca> PORK 'ER
[5:01:41] <+Kodkiro> @xen0riddley @SunjammerIV Thanks for the recommendation
[5:01:42] <cheapdoc> @Sonny_Firestorm huh, I didn't expect it, that's kindda fun
[5:01:47] <s1rcuit> imagine getting killed by a pig balloon
[5:01:50] <fuji_n2> PIG'EM
[5:01:58] <+FingaLights> Porkamancy'
[5:01:59] <Sonny_Firestorm> You need a couple things for the full Gun build though.

[5:02:18] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its a big pig
[5:02:19] <%kainhighwind1990> Have you ever been hit with a flying pig?
[5:02:21] <%JoshManVGH> imagine spending years perfecting the "Orb Pig" spell.
[5:02:22] <%Agami23> have you ever had a pig thrown at you? shit hurts
[5:02:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> Oh shit, I just remembered

[5:03:32] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt That fairy familiar will point out fake walls to you

[5:03:34] <FullMetalSnorlax> you feed pig, he grow strong
[5:03:37] <+Catpurnicus> SAVE
[5:03:37] <Sonny_Firestorm> piano
[5:03:39] <%moonmintparadise> go to plano
[5:03:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> if you could cast big glazed ham slices from your hands would you just walk out onto the street and start shooting them at stray animals
[5:03:50] <+Dova573> the most powerful stand
[5:03:56] <supakaminarikun> fairy can help you find secret and also heal you
[5:03:56] <FullMetalSnorlax> Pizano
[5:04:00] <%MidnightPacif1c> moon2SPIN
[5:04:01] <+brave_sj> Yes
[5:04:02] <+CreggaMonsta> how stained is the blood?
[5:04:08] <%cartakus> Hey plague!
[5:04:14] <%twistedj3ster> awww the fairy isn't round and oinking...
[5:04:19] <SaltyAzteca> I dunno whether theyd be happy or not
[5:04:19] <%TheDullaMAN> But are we sure it's glazed?
[5:04:20] <%JoshManVGH> Aww give them all a snack!
[5:04:21] <Profmcstevie> Specifically the pigs
[5:04:23] <cheapdoc> I mean, stray animals gotta eat
[5:04:30] <Top_Lane_Duelist> 420 glaze it
[5:04:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> Zagan shard gives chance of multiple items from crafting
[5:04:37] <Saltmeisterr> WTF
[5:04:39] <kinkade_77> dont be mean to her
[5:04:39] <+pectusumbra> yeah she really sucks besides the fact that she can heal for you
[5:04:40] <fuji_n2> she's utility
[5:04:40] <%livlinn> Happy new year Plague! PrideRise
[5:04:45] <FullMetalSnorlax> she can use healing items, and tell you about breakable walls
[5:04:47] <Saltmeisterr> THAT GUY JUST THROWS BUERS
[5:04:52] <Saltmeisterr> thats sick!
[5:04:53] <fuji_n2> she's not dps
[5:04:53] <%waltzqueen> she heals you eventually
[5:04:57] <%andrewofbob> The fairy has a super useless feature where it pulls fairy-only items out of your inventory
[5:04:57] <+izanagi22> It's a 2% drop for Zagan though, so fair warning
[5:04:59] <+brave_sj> Fairy is mostly a healer but she only uses special separate fairy potions. she kinda sucks.
[5:05:04] <Profmcstevie> Welcome to 2022 Plague, hope you and your family are well
[5:05:06] <%Animatic_> she uses those fairie meds you picked up.
[5:05:09] <+pectusumbra> the medicine she drops she uses, and only she can use them
[5:05:09] <Sonny_Firestorm> If you have Pixie Potions, she can use them
[5:05:11] <fuji_n2> she can use those fairy medicine
[5:05:13] <cheapdoc> pai ano
[5:05:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> If I met a mage that shot glazed pineapple ham at me, I might give it a shot
[5:05:17] <+Cameony> My wife and I are watching the stream side-by-side and there's like a 60 second discrepancy between us, she's ahead
[5:05:18] <%kainhighwind1990> She also finds hidden walls for you
[5:05:19] <FrostedZaibatsu> The wall detection is the best
[5:05:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Saltmeisterr Alas, poor President Buer has been reduced to a mere projectile
[5:05:23] <+re_double> u need fairy medicine in your inventory tho
[5:05:26] <FullMetalSnorlax> fairy points out breakable walls if you klevel her up
[5:05:32] <kingra> SourPls

[5:05:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> aren't these the fairies you murder for fun
[5:05:42] <%cartakus> It's bad
[5:05:43] <+BelricPsytar> Not great but not terrible
[5:05:43] <%twistedj3ster> now make the pig sing
[5:05:44] <+izanagi22> @Keyd00d LUL

[5:05:53] <SomersaultJustice> the jp version is better
[5:05:53] <+Kodkiro> its neat
[5:05:54] <PanicSwytch> Noooooo
[5:05:54] <heartlesshealer> no vocal training, but nice enough
[5:05:55] <Ipsenscastle> voice is kinda grating
[5:05:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> Some people prefer Japanese
[5:05:56] <Profmcstevie> Is there a different song in JP?
[5:05:56] <+TheBitingIrish> PAT NOO
[5:05:57] <+Mrbaconator> her voice is kind of uh not great

[5:06:01] <fuji_n2> LUL
[5:06:01] <$SGrim> Dropping that to a 7/10 after the high note
[5:06:01] <+Cameony> you get an achievement if you hear the whole song
[5:06:01] <artoflec> the english dub makes me giggle in this game
[5:06:04] <+hush_wolf> yeah, talented lady but song not amazing
[5:06:04] <%Keyd00d> @izanagi22 It sounded similar at first lol

[5:10:21] <%cartakus> You get thicc legs
[5:10:23] <FullMetalSnorlax> you need to upgrade it to unlock all the moves
[5:10:24] <+brave_sj> The point is to be a sexy bunny girl
[5:10:30] <+pectusumbra> you get their moveset. Also you can pause while transformed to see the model up close :p
[5:10:31] <Vashido22> pause when you're in bunny form
[5:10:39] <supakaminarikun> Bunny is glass cannon
[5:10:42] <notabrobro> DOG

[5:11:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> I need to see more of whatever that was
[5:11:14] <+Joe2187> Dive kick and lightning legs as well
[5:11:15] <+re_double> never saw this
[5:11:18] <%Agami23> is that fairy using your items to heal you like that?
[5:11:21] <MaledictusXCII> what? LUL
[5:11:22] <Sonny_Firestorm> also, you SLIDES and DIVE KICKS also scale with magic.
[5:11:23] <+justianxix> LUL Glitch
[5:11:23] <Sol_Install> OH YEA
[5:11:28] <Sol_Install> that make sesne
[5:11:32] <+Fooguwu> PAt's willingness to be inside enemies perplexes me
[5:11:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> Ok, that makes sense
[5:11:33] <MaybeFalco> that dog is LETHAL
[5:11:34] <+re_double> must be from update
[5:11:35] <+pectusumbra> @Agami23 It uses items only she can use
[5:11:36] <fuji_n2> no more healing
[5:11:39] <%Jhylla81> Fairy uses fairy items to heal
[5:11:44] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> eat cheese in middle of boss fight mangoHmm
[5:11:48] <%cartakus> No health
[5:11:54] <+pectusumbra> risky but very worth
[5:11:58] <%ReaverbotJesus> Did he sit at the piano with the fairy yet?
[5:12:00] <+Joe2187> practice bunny in save room
[5:12:00] <Sonny_Firestorm> Sit down on save room for a bit.
[5:12:08] <%FacetiousAF> yea reaver
[5:12:13] <Evendrag> yes reaver
[5:12:21] <cheapdoc> Bunnygirl DT
[5:12:22] <artoflec> you probably gotta level it up
[5:12:23] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> no dive kick?
[5:12:23] <dinnydanny777> debugYes Bunny Girl
[5:12:23] <ohkayNiko> u have to level it up to get more moves
[5:12:23] <%andrewofbob> Quarter circles?
[5:12:24] <+Catpurnicus> no theres a moveset
[5:12:25] <pixelkenj> do you know about the unlockable drop kick spam in Castlevania? It gets bonus damage in that form
[5:12:25] <+izanagi22> You get more moves with higher rank iirc
[5:12:26] <MaybeFalco> they get more moves as you rank it up i believe
[5:12:26] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt Rank up to unlock more moves
[5:12:27] <FullMetalSnorlax> YOU  NEED TO UPGRADE IT TO GET MORE MOVES
[5:12:30] <OldManDeckardCain> didn't you need grade or lvl for more moves?
[5:12:30] <ohkayNiko> u get a chun-li kick
[5:12:31] <%DashXero> There's more, but it's not really worth it.
[5:12:32] <+seaearthandsky> I think you have to lvl it up
[5:12:32] <+FingaLights> Do you have to upgrade to get it?
[5:12:33] <Evendrag> @facetiousaf jinx!
[5:12:33] <56Bagels> is this Pat's first time through this? I can't believe that
[5:12:34] <%kainhighwind1990> Gotta level it up
[5:12:38] <%ReaverbotJesus> Love all the little easter eggs in this game, too bad the switch port is ass
[5:12:39] <%RealThiele> yea she doiesnt scale well
[5:12:39] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> bunny girl has motions?
[5:12:41] <fuji_n2> you need high rank I think
[5:12:42] <Profmcstevie> Grade and Rank are always a thing
[5:12:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> get Chun-li kick barrage and throw knife
[5:12:50] <FrostedZaibatsu> Chun-li stomp is what broke the game @PatStaresAt
[5:12:54] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt you changed your equipment back to worse stuff
[5:12:55] <Mattais88> RAn like dogshit
[5:12:57] <supakaminarikun> bunny had pletzer
[5:12:57] <Vashido22> since you used the shortcut
[5:12:57] <%FacetiousAF> switch port was janked as fuck
[5:12:58] <%andrewofbob> The Switch port is shite
[5:13:03] <Profmcstevie> Cos it runs like poopy
[5:13:04] <+SargentToughie> It's because the Switch port was really awful when it launched
[5:13:06] <+Dova573> i have the ps4  version
[5:13:06] <+swesterly> is this just SotN but horny
[5:13:07] <fuji_n2> cause it's garbage
[5:13:07] <%LowSkillGod> it was really controversial how bad it was on switch @PatStaresAt
[5:13:09] <+Catpurnicus> mash attack in bunny form
[5:13:12] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> switch has a huge user base
[5:13:13] <+Catpurnicus> and hit your backstep
[5:13:14] <cheapdoc> Is that a glitch?
[5:13:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @56Bagels Technically 2nd, but he didn't finish it the first time, and I don't think he got super far from what I understand
[5:13:17] <ShinMaddrox> The Switch port was terrible for the longest time,
[5:13:17] <+pectusumbra> unicorn ring
[5:13:17] <%Agami23> because metroidvanias work good portable and it ran BAD
[5:13:17] <Vashido22> dance mask and unicorn ring
[5:13:20] <FullMetalSnorlax> switch port sucked, development was held back a year trying to make it suck less
[5:13:21] <+Hyphixsys> JOJO
[5:13:22] <+izanagi22> It's what I got it on since my favorite Castlevanias were on handheld too
[5:13:22] <ZaerichAnakalypton> It seemed like something I would like to play on the switch; I regret that decision
[5:13:23] <+justianxix> thats what I played it on, a bunch of people it seems
[5:13:25] <%DianaTheAscian> is the PS4 version okay?
[5:13:25] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> switch user base is also very loud
[5:13:26] <Sonny_Firestorm> @swesterly SotN was horny too
[5:13:30] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt unicorn ring and dance mask
[5:13:33] <%andrewofbob> I'm running it now and it has 30fps, has loading hitches, and wants to trigger eppileptic seizures
[5:13:34] <$Emperor_Machinus> did they eventually patch the switch to be good?
[5:13:35] <SunjammerIV> sotn has a boss with tits straight exposed to the air
[5:13:36] <cheapdoc> Dance Mask
[5:13:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Grinding those Bunny girls can also get you a dope as scarf.... as well as mats for upgrading the shard and making a cool whip
[5:13:37] <MaledictusXCII> switch version is fine now
[5:13:39] <marvel877> PS4's fine
[5:13:40] <+brave_sj> I backed it and got my backer copy on the switch, huge mistake
[5:13:41] <%cartakus> I wanna play god hand....
[5:13:43] <%MisterRockett> I just opened the game up for the first time in months and it started downloading a 30 minute patch.
[5:13:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> @DianaTheAscian yes, it works perfectly
[5:13:44] <+pectusumbra> and mask
[5:13:47] <+izanagi22> Dance mask
[5:13:49] <OldManDeckardCain> the ps4 version is ok, pc still best by a mile
[5:13:56] <%DianaTheAscian> kk
[5:14:03] <56Bagels> @Valentinius_Anodyne that's wack, but hey at least he's giving it an honest (??) shot again
[5:14:08] <pixelkenj> dont even have that many heal items to amplify
[5:14:09] <Vashido22> SourPls
[5:14:14] <+izanagi22> catJAM
[5:14:15] <+justianxix> SourPls

[5:14:23] <+brave_sj> Haha, SourPls
[5:14:26] <%Jhylla81> Im tempted to redownload the switch version and see if they patched more of it. Haven't played it since it came out
[5:14:26] <+pectusumbra> true, if you are willing, it's worth farming lili for sure
[5:14:32] <+hush_wolf> big dog
[5:14:33] <@Jekado> oh yeah that happened to me to
[5:14:34] <+twohitgood> oh yeah, you somehow outran the boss, right?
[5:14:39] <marvel877> yeah, this was the bug
[5:14:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @56Bagels Hell yeah, it's a great game and it's nice to see more people playing it
[5:14:41] <+pectusumbra> and yeah, the game could break at this boss fight
[5:14:47] <+brave_sj> I wish SourPls worked on mobile
[5:14:49] <@Ranryu692> wanna make a backup save?
[5:14:50] <Evendrag> damn, they made ot way easier to master stuff didnt they

[5:17:54] <+brave_sj> What I really want is a god damn shiny Turtwig
[5:17:55] <+izanagi22> The music really makes up for how jank this level can be
[5:18:00] <%TheDullaMAN> If you really wanna traverse this place, come back with double jump.
[5:18:00] <+twohitgood> gotta love that the kicks are a traversal skill.
[5:18:04] <dinnydanny777> Cool B)
[5:18:05] <+justianxix> try it on
[5:18:07] <kingra> Looks cool

[5:18:13] <artoflec> elaBased
[5:18:14] <marvel877> No shit, they had Wayforward come in to help and the game still has jank like that sometimes.
[5:18:16] <+pectusumbra> gives you a little dark resistance but you are correct, it's not about the stats :P
[5:18:17] <tape_player> everyone knows stats aren't real
[5:18:17] <+Pars_Librum> Fashion as always is the true end game
[5:18:17] <%CalderGaming> "Deal With It"
[5:18:18] <kingra> B)
[5:18:20] <+justianxix> All about the FASHION
[5:18:20] <StarkAvKnark> I clapped, I clapped when it happened
[5:18:21] <+izanagi22> This game REALLY needed Transmog
[5:18:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> B)
[5:18:26] <+Pixel_Matt> CoolCat
[5:18:29] <dinnydanny777> The drip B)

[5:19:11] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:19:13] <%kainhighwind1990> Yeah
[5:19:14] <Vashido22> I FORGOT ITS EVRY TIME LUL
[5:19:15] <+WeLucklessJacks> This part is a lagging nightmare on Switch.
[5:19:15] <Evendrag> i wanted to post the clip
[5:19:18] <+justianxix> Yeah this place is confusing
[5:19:20] <%RealThiele> gear AND shard sets
[5:19:20] <+pectusumbra> this area is more complex than you'd expect from a tower level
[5:19:21] <FullMetalSnorlax> the bugs didnt do that at launche, they actually patched that in for some reason
[5:19:22] <fuji_n2> yes
[5:19:22] <tattleworm> i forget exactly how but there's a way to change the loadout so it only changes the weapon, not your armour and shards
[5:19:23] <pixelkenj> I got lost in this tower many times
[5:19:25] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt fitting that the insectoid enemies are a bit buggy
[5:19:26] <SaltyAzteca> Why they gotta die like that DansGame
[5:19:28] <dinnydanny777> catJAM
[5:19:36] <+brave_sj> I can't believe Woolie would allow that to happen
[5:19:38] <Evendrag> thats a BUG BUG HAHH
[5:19:47] <%kainhighwind1990> Chat, isn'tt that one sword here?
[5:19:47] <SaltyAzteca> @SGrim You stop this
[5:19:49] <%Arrotal> its because those enemies are not on the same plane as you but the parts of their death animation need to be on the right plane, so it stretches I guess
[5:19:50] <%Valdorick> Question gamers - why do clock towers have the best themes?
[5:19:54] <MaybeFalco> there's so much hidden stuff in this one single room its insane
[5:19:54] <%cartakus> boo
[5:20:15] <%RealThiele> so how much of the legendary node stuff should i farm?
[5:20:15] <$SGrim> @SaltyAzteca I'm just winging it.
[5:20:29] <pixelkenj> yeeeee
[5:20:31] <kingra> Cool
[5:20:33] <%DianaTheAscian> cool
[5:20:34] <%kainhighwind1990> yup there it is
[5:20:35] <%cartakus> Clock towers must be amazing. It's a clock tower
[5:20:36] <+justianxix> a CLASSIC
[5:20:36] <MaybeFalco> its so good

[5:21:47] <Sonny_Firestorm> trivializes room clearing and most bosses alike

[5:28:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> Look at the background in that large room.
[5:28:04] <zodiark26> chat: did you do that one thing pat?
[5:28:05] <+Pars_Librum> Hm, those blue crystals looked familiar
[5:28:05] <%CalderGaming> the backseating today is intense
[5:28:05] <+twohitgood> that blue bit is your hint at what is interactable
[5:28:07] <fuji_n2> doors?
[5:28:09] <dmtjinni> chat trippin
[5:28:12] <pixelkenj> """ door """
[5:28:19] <fuji_n2> wield it says doors
[5:28:20] <%Bt_Robot> That's a very important thing in the next room
[5:28:26] <fuji_n2> wierd
[5:28:26] <%FacetiousAF> doors... monkey cages...
[5:28:28] <heartlesshealer> oh, they mean pay attention to visual cues
[5:28:31] <+Pars_Librum> Pat, that was a bookshelf, not a door
[5:28:34] <+twohitgood> "door" is better described as "interactable object'
[5:28:39] <+pectusumbra> they mean any of that glowing shit, yeah
[5:28:39] <%andrewofbob> You know the trick - disguise the door as a bookcase
[5:28:41] <Sonny_Firestorm> It sorta is.
[5:28:43] <cheapdoc> The painting ability is so strong, I love it
[5:28:45] <+hush_wolf> i agree, f that
[5:28:51] <Radioactivetaco9> yea thats definitly on the game LUL
[5:28:51] <Sonny_Firestorm> Secret door
[5:28:54] <Treasure_Vault> Books are doors to another world!
[5:29:04] <+hush_wolf> XD
[5:29:04] <Treasure_Vault> You know, metaphorically.
[5:29:10] <+hush_wolf> gtfo here
[5:29:24] <tattleworm> huh, those things hurt
[5:29:42] <pixelkenj> who filed away these monkeys into the library
[5:29:47] <Sonny_Firestorm> @tattleworm they're usually found in another zone later down the line, hence why they're "traps" here
[5:29:48] <+justianxix> hate those monkeys
[5:29:49] <%andrewofbob> Yeah, avoid releasing the monkeys unless you want to fight them
[5:30:07] <kingra> Cute
[5:30:11] <+justianxix> judging silently
[5:30:11] <%TimetodiveLTX> hyperventilator would be a good gun name too
[5:30:24] <%DashXero> My guess: A big spender.
[5:30:26] <%Keyd00d> admire the man
[5:30:26] <+tempestzephyr> backer
[5:30:28] <dmtjinni> secret
[5:30:28] <pixelkenj> Hmmmmm
[5:30:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ambience
[5:30:30] <zodiark26> just a guy that donated more
[5:30:32] <Zombrocom> Higher trier supporter I guess?
[5:30:33] <%orbulon> love me some chairs
[5:30:35] <FullMetalSnorlax> Do you njot enjoy sitting?
[5:30:35] <Treasure_Vault> Library!
[5:30:36] <+pectusumbra> It's a library
[5:30:38] <heartlesshealer> to sit and read
[5:30:38] <stranger59> It's called being fancy
[5:30:42] <tape_player> libraries have a lot of chairs?
[5:30:45] <@GeneralSCPatton> I think you might get to see a ghost painter if you sit long enough in one of those empty painting rooms
[5:30:55] <tattleworm> sit on every chair to unlock the chair sitter achievement
[5:31:02] <heartlesshealer> Pig so damn powerful
[5:31:09] <Sonny_Firestorm> shortcut
[5:31:13] <Treasure_Vault> Missed a breakable wall, I think.
[5:31:13] <+Grayhammatter> pigged
[5:31:14] <+justianxix> shortcut
[5:31:24] <@GeneralSCPatton> Also, there's a shard that gives you the sit-to-heal ability from Dawn of Sorrow
[5:31:31] <Treasure_Vault> Breakable wall at far right end of the long hallway.
[5:31:36] <%TheDullaMAN> The Fairy doesn't do that.
[5:31:40] <Treasure_Vault> Might be full of shit though.
[5:31:46] <%TheDullaMAN> A different shard does that.
[5:31:47] <FullMetalSnorlax> YOU NEED TO UPGRADE THE FAIRY BEFORE SHE DOES THAT
[5:31:51] <%waltzqueen> does she not do that?
[5:31:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> @GeneralSCPatton Chair Mimic doesn't do heal-on-sit.
[5:32:00] <+pectusumbra> ah apparently an upgrade
[5:32:01] <Profmcstevie> It doesn't "yet"
[5:32:02] <%waltzqueen> Upgrade the fairy, ohhh
[5:32:04] <%kainhighwind1990> gotta level her up
[5:32:05] <Sonny_Firestorm> You can, down + Jump
[5:32:07] <%DashXero> You got multi- woolieONEGUY
[5:32:11] <FrostedZaibatsu> Fairy has an aoe detection i believe
[5:32:18] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat  level it up I'm guessing
[5:32:26] <@GeneralSCPatton> @Sonny_Firestorm Oh, did I remember that wrong?
[5:32:28] <%TheDullaMAN> The Fairy will OCCASIONALLY point at breakables.
[5:32:35] <+justianxix> LUL
[5:32:36] <kingra> Oh
[5:32:39] <%DashXero> Well I'll be damned.
[5:32:40] <%SolumFuturae> sus
[5:32:42] <%DashXero> I was wrong.
[5:32:43] <Sonny_Firestorm> @GeneralSCPatton I know cause I did too.
[5:32:45] <+hush_wolf> she does her best
[5:32:48] <+brave_sj> She's doing her best Pat.
[5:32:49] <Zombrocom> Man, that pig is STRONG
[5:32:49] <heartlesshealer> she just takes a while, damn
[5:32:54] <fuji_n2> man chats dumb LUL
[5:32:57] <FullMetalSnorlax> upgrading fairy increases the odds
[5:32:57] <%TheDullaMAN> Books are another familiar.
[5:33:03] <Bakafied> The most powerful weapon: Gun
[5:33:08] <+pectusumbra> and the other familiar
[5:33:08] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[5:33:14] <FullMetalSnorlax> Don't attack the flying lady, she is your friend!
[5:33:16] <+izanagi22> That death animation is straight out of SotN LUL
[5:33:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> that demoness is docile until attacked
[5:33:31] <+blue_twitch> boar blaster
[5:33:36] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt How does this compare to the actual Castlevanis iyo so far?
[5:33:37] <FullMetalSnorlax> Rul'sha are non-hostile unless you attack themk, they give you buffs if you wait
[5:33:38] <%waltzqueen> baller
[5:33:44] <ammobasket> pig if true
[5:33:46] <%TheDullaMAN> Gotta do it with Thorn Whip
[5:33:46] <+blacksoap65> Whip super slow
[5:33:47] <+justianxix> real belmont hours
[5:33:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So you can get an ability from every enemy as long as you kill them a bunch of times?
[5:33:53] <%FacetiousAF> nothing for THAT whip
[5:33:57] <Vashido22> not for that one
[5:33:58] <artoflec> i hope in inevitable bloodstained 2 theres just a shit ton of moves
[5:34:08] <+pectusumbra> there is one but you need thorn whip or snake bite
[5:34:10] <%TheDullaMAN> You might be able to make a Thorn Whip
[5:34:12] <Sonny_Firestorm> Go back, go up
[5:34:15] <+pectusumbra> also you can get ALOT of stuff early with alchemy
[5:34:31] <+blue_twitch> farts canonically demons
[5:34:34] <+tempestzephyr> summon fart
[5:34:42] <Treasure_Vault> Fart conjuration is too taboo
[5:34:44] <FullMetalSnorlax> if you hang out with the lady who drops the flame whip she is friendly and gives you buffas
[5:34:45] <Sypheck> fart conjurer is a much needed class
[5:34:53] <+Dova573> man I would love a rogue like mode for bloodstained
[5:35:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> cameo incoming
[5:35:17] <+brave_sj> There's a bookcase somewhere that tells you how to use the whip to give the past the slip. I think you have to step on a crack and break your mama's back though.
[5:35:21] <%andrewofbob> Fairy wants to kill
[5:35:25] <Vashido22> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[5:35:25] <+pectusumbra> yeah that's the only enemy that does that

[5:38:55] <+pectusumbra> fair enough
[5:39:06] <+pectusumbra> this is a game where you can absolutely "Grind offscreen"
[5:39:14] <+KrissFliss> Square Enix is going to start with NFT's now, so that's something...

[5:39:39] <+brave_sj> She's called a Carabosse for some reason like she's too good to be a regular ass fairy
[5:39:40] <+pectusumbra> it usually runs in tiers so you need more rare matierals to get the highest ranks, if I remember right
[5:39:45] <%Broand> heretical grinder gets big
