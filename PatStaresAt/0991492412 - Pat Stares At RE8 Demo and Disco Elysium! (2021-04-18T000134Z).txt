[0:17:04] <%dalmek> " A fine cigar unlike cigarettes is natural. Its ash is essentially just carbon, potassium, and calcium.. nothing harmful"
[0:17:04] <aiutare47> @ShineTheDiamond Its actually a manual, like it has nice pictures and instructions with a bit of historical context. So it has "How to make a Celt Ax" out of rocks and trees, or how to make a forge. Its real cool
[0:17:05] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[0:17:06] <thatlolifrompersona1> Do they eat it?

[0:26:19] <$HyperionXV> @theshillman Opossum with a silent O are the north american rrat-shaped racoon like marsupial. Possums without the silient O are tiny australian monkey-like marsupials.
[0:26:21] <%walternatorz> suzi just finished the demo early
[0:26:25] <VvTacoSaladvV> Skunks like "fuck around and find out."
[0:26:27] <%Dakuu75> I walk in at "dumbster chicken" got coffee then came back to "max lost to a skunk"
[0:26:29] <%sniffy77> opossums are objectively the best animals in the universe
[0:26:33] <Chibi_Dino_Bun> @patstaresat Raccoons wash their food. They get sad when you give them a sugar cube
[0:26:37] <%Schizocyte> An opossum will eat ~5,000 ticks every season
[0:26:38] <DianaTheAscian> For some reason I forget that dogs can eat animals

[0:27:05] <KasiCrafter> Big Fat Willy
[0:27:05] <VvTacoSaladvV> Armadillos are armored opossums.
[0:27:06] <%bustawof> @devbob98 you too LUL

[0:29:11] <willyfreshness> coyotes have taken many a family pet from me
[0:29:14] <%AzureGale> What about foxes
[0:29:14] <SomeOtherNeb> is that why you prefer women that can't go in the wild without exploding now?
[0:29:15] <+urdumb4twitching> an average  person can take a coyote in one on one combat

[0:31:23] <Devbob98> Written by an only child
[0:31:26] <%extradopeness> icky
[0:31:27] <+robosqueeb> there is so much creepy shit in the news right now about decriminalizing incest
[0:31:27] <%Monkeyweed21> FUCK OFF FUTABA THIS IS GETTING CREEPY
[0:31:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Not blood-related *airhorns blare*
[0:31:29] <+themightyquinn3000> Insert *ready for vampire mommy* joke here
[0:31:30] <Profmcstevie> Yeah they're nudging enough to hurt your ribs in that game
[0:31:30] <%Bailey__gaming> incest is winsecst in that game
[0:31:31] <%JoshManVGH> That's... unfortunate

[0:31:32] <Chibi_Dino_Bun> I miss Elmo

[0:31:36] <Ethel9727> Is it as bad as Fire Emblem: Fates? AKA "Four sisters, four brothers, but you aren't related by blood so go ahead."
[0:31:44] <%ssjklyco> my giant vampire sister can't possibly be this cute
[0:31:47] <%ExpressNode> They did the same thing in Trails in the Sky to which was also weird
[0:31:52] <mannywatcha> Cheer300\
[0:31:55] <%AzureGale> Sacred stones might be the champion of overt incest overtones in games
[0:32:00] <Manwad> doesn't the westermarck effect pop regardless of blood relation?
[0:32:02] <CrimsonFox777> monkaS
[0:32:05] <mannywatcha> i cant i give bits
[0:32:06] <+darkpulse703> DQ 11 is phenomenal !!!
[0:32:07] <%AzureGale> Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones, that is
[0:32:08] <iosephe> mhm
[0:32:08] <%Dakuu75> chat, you need to use commas and gramar when you dono, brothers
[0:32:11] <+cascadepersona> @tracazoid That's the Cold Steel games. The Trails in the Sky games are kinda different than when they decided to ape Persona
[0:32:20] <%BigCoffee> Making a copy of ff or dq1 these days wouldnt take long
[0:32:27] <Devbob98> Who needs commas? Losers that’s who
[0:32:29] <%Sausious> Early DQ was better than early FF but FF got alot better and inovated
[0:32:30] <ChungusQuest> Higher highs and lower lows
[0:32:34] <DianaTheAscian> FF changes it up a lot more
[0:32:35] <%cache_22> Final Fantasy games are borderline experimental.
[0:32:38] <%Agami23> yeah dragonquest is very very samey
[0:32:39] <Profmcstevie> DQ is familiarity, FF is wild
[0:32:39] <%extradopeness> no dont listen to that guy never use commas or any if that shit ots for nerds
[0:32:39] <+cascadepersona> Final Fantasy is more novel whereas Dragon Quest is stable
[0:32:42] <%Bailey__gaming> oswrevCoke
[0:32:42] <OkamiDude15> if you fuck your sister you'll get some pretty cool passive bonuses and dual techs tho psaUp - falcom probably
[0:32:50] <+darkpulse703> yeap
[0:32:51] <waffleandman> dragon quest is just the same throughout
[0:32:54] <kikoeru_san> also some DQ games are long as shit
[0:32:58] <+MaxInaba> DQ sticks to its guns, FF actually experiments
[0:33:01] <Dunmarkh> Dragon quest spinoffs are great
[0:33:03] <%ExpressNode> He talked about grammar by misspelling it
[0:33:04] <%MelBrooksKA> @Devbob98 Grandma needs commas
[0:33:04] <%Drunkengen> I dont think DQ would make a plot about Magic is dead thing
[0:33:08] <Sotetsu> I still love Dragon Warrior 1
[0:33:12] <%captain_thickthighs> did I miss the vamp tits?
[0:33:12] <cardamomo88> same plot kinda
[0:33:13] <%BigCoffee> DQ has story differences, like 5-8-11, but the gameplay is just the same fucking shit
[0:33:14] <+cascadepersona> FF5 the goat
[0:33:20] <balthazar758> i love commas,
[0:33:21] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt do u know if dq11 on the switch is good?
[0:33:22] <+panlakes> I just got some medicine set aside for this demo and am looking forward to the critiques
[0:33:22] <MusouMiko> its basically playing the same game 11 times with varying quality
[0:33:24] <rekinom> 13, 13-2, 13-3
[0:33:25] <%Alazull> Oh FF13-complete apathy
[0:33:28] <+DarkNerdShawny> I love FF8!
[0:33:29] <%AzureGale> I like how you just skipped FFX
[0:33:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'D RATHER FF8 THAN X-2~
[0:33:32] <kikoeru_san> God damn it Pat now I wanna keep playing FFV, but disco
[0:33:33] <Laecerelius> We really need FF3/4 style FF5 and 6 remakes
[0:33:34] <shadowknight145> You played one DQ, you kinda played them all
[0:33:34] <%radda343> "ehhhh" is the best description of X-2 I've ever seen
[0:33:36] <%Nordguy> don't you talk shit about my girl FFX-2
[0:33:37] <marvel877> and then you get 13...
[0:33:39] <%JoshManVGH> The job system in X2 was great
[0:33:40] <Profmcstevie> DQ is fine with scoring a double, FF WANTS A HOME RUN and sometimes misses the ball
[0:33:40] <Pandybun> @PatStaresAt I like your Moogle shirt
[0:33:40] <%BigCoffee> @DianaTheAscian its the best version of dq11
[0:33:41] <%extradopeness> commas are for posers
[0:33:44] <%BubbaRands> Payne was how i got into punk chicks so....yay?
[0:33:44] <cardamomo88> LUL
[0:33:47] <%Puhff> Microsoft Flight Sim when?
[0:33:49] <Lutre> DQ9 basically has chalice dungeons as the end game
[0:33:49] <%radda343> X-2 so fun to play but boy is everything else garbage
[0:33:55] <hot4dukat> Boo triple triad
[0:33:56] <DianaTheAscian> @BigCoffee k thx
[0:33:59] <%cache_22> I wish more Ace Combat games were playable on current consoles.
[0:34:11] <+oda_flobunaga> FF X2 has the best ATB systen in all FF and the worst story in FF
[0:34:12] <%BigCoffee> @DianaTheAscian np fam
[0:34:12] <+MugenSandan> or FF13, HEEEEUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHH
[0:34:13] <%Bailey__gaming> Microsoft Flight Simulatior is so bizarre but sucessesfi
[0:34:33] <ProjektRF> You can speedrun this demo in like 5 minutes
[0:34:33] <aiutare47> Pat, can you pause the stream I need to get another slice of grape pie
[0:34:39] <$Zalthia> I played x2 when I was younger, but I dont know if it would hold up. I love all the dress spheres though.

[0:35:01] <%radda343> I like the evil being mostly man-made in RE
[0:35:01] <%BigCoffee> X-2's combat is near 10/10 but the story is like a weak 7/10

[0:35:18] <%patriotrenegade> it did?
[0:35:21] <lemon_lover28> zombies oh no wait plagas
[0:35:22] <%AJ_Cherenkov> are you saying you wouldn't fight cosmic shit in RE?
[0:35:23] <scht3v3> They did mention the old gods in the prayer
[0:35:24] <Ethel9727> What if Bloodborne was a  RE game all along?
[0:35:24] <%captain_thickthighs> so next is wesker chthulu
[0:35:25] <%patriotrenegade> I dont remember
[0:35:27] <%BigCoffee> progenitor virus was pretty ok
[0:35:27] <BlueLunecy> The secret to Resident Evil is that we want more RE4
[0:35:31] <balthazar758> mutated nature
[0:35:32] <%BigCoffee> before it got fucked
[0:35:33] <mannywatcha> Could RE6 be remaid and improved or is there no hope for that one?
[0:35:35] <OkamiDude15> man is the TRUE evil
[0:35:35] <ARobotFromtheFuture1> @patstaresat hey Pat just started Shadowbringers and god I love it
[0:35:35] <%Drunkengen> It turns out it was man.
[0:35:36] <Devbob98> The evil is the rich
[0:35:36] <Aydarkzero> @bustawof i knew it wouldn't be as good as the 1st game Kappa
[0:35:37] <+Gespens> Las Plagas
[0:35:37] <%shurtal> what if we take this thing, and just SHOVE IT IN PEOPLES VEINS
[0:35:39] <doublemasteramerica> Pat how are you gonna feel when the viruses and parasites are all from space?
[0:35:41] <%Uselesswhitenoise> "bears can fuck you up, what if we put machine guns on it?"
[0:35:43] <thelonechris> The western pharmaceutical monopoly wants to make some $$$
[0:35:44] <%Eilocke> Eilocke subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! ultimately, there will always be a biolab
[0:35:44] <+darkpulse703> lol
[0:35:47] <%Jamejarrs> Am I too late? Has Pat played yet?
[0:35:48] <%AzureGale> Good ass-scientists
[0:35:50] <+oda_flobunaga> So RE 8 Women are a problem, so a guy comes along and makes areal bigg woman
[0:35:50] <+superchronicc> lets use this flower to become gods among men
[0:35:50] <%bustawof> LUL
[0:35:51] <%ElkRiverDog> Good thing re8 is a reskin of re4 then
[0:36:00] <+ssjklyco> it makes Wesker teleport
[0:36:00] <%miguelrod777> what if we made it more dangerous
[0:36:00] <+DarkNerdShawny> I feel like im the only human that doesnt like Re4 but loves all the other RE games
[0:36:01] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I can't wait for Paige to stream this and get stuck on a puzzle for 30 minutes
[0:36:02] <%captain_thickthighs> so would it be possible to one day have a resident evil that doesn't take place in modern day?
[0:36:03] <+darkpulse703> monkaW Big pharma
[0:36:04] <%Frost_Quill> There's a reason most people don't know about the natural version basically.
[0:36:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stop selectively breeding and splicing these natural monstars!
[0:36:04] <%Dementedpenguin> @Jamejarrs not yet
[0:36:09] <rufus2k2> @Jamejarrs just running out the clock as susual
[0:36:12] <+oda_flobunaga> DAY 3 Hype!
[0:36:15] <hot4dukat> @bluelunecy Lol! True
[0:36:21] <+Birdigalore> Wesker doesn't teleport, he just moves fast
[0:36:27] <%Jamejarrs> Ah, good haha
[0:36:30] <+Birdigalore> huehue
[0:36:33] <$Zalthia> When did Re7 come out again?
[0:36:35] <fat_burtreynolds> Aww sleepy pat:
[0:36:42] <+spookycool> Did he start yet
[0:36:46] <Devbob98> I’m hyped for the lab design in re8
[0:36:48] <kikoeru_san> RE is the story of "White man sees some crazy plant then weaponizes it
[0:36:48] <%patriotrenegade> But this time, its gonna be bio DUNGEON
[0:36:55] <+OddEyesGardevoir> Just got done with the demo. I’m excited
[0:36:57] <%captain_thickthighs> do it in reverse
[0:36:59] <%BigCoffee> Do you think RE8 could be the best one in the series?
[0:37:00] <OkamiDude15> @Zalthia 2017
[0:37:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Gotta have a lab or it's not RE
[0:37:06] <fat_burtreynolds> There’s always a man, a city, and tower
[0:37:07] <%captain_thickthighs> wa
[0:37:11] <%MelBrooksKA> Has anything broken the formula and also been good? @PatStaresAt
[0:37:12] <QuasarKnightGaming> Has he done the 8 demo yet?
[0:37:13] <atgithursdays> Why the fuck did you count on your fingers like that?
[0:37:14] <%patriotrenegade> Dont forget boat
[0:37:17] <cardamomo88> the cycle of RE
[0:37:18] <theshillman> i hope the lab in village is all renaissance looking
[0:37:23] <%DoktorZee> LUL
[0:37:23] <%captain_thickthighs> @Wait Pat doesn't that mean bloodborne does it in reverse because you start out in a lab?
[0:37:25] <Devbob98> If it ain’t broke
[0:37:26] <Aydarkzero> VCB
[0:37:29] <%Valdorick> LUL
[0:37:30] <bob900000> LUL LUL
[0:37:32] <+darkpulse703> :)
[0:37:33] <+MoonObscure> LOL
[0:37:33] <%BigCoffee> ok but re5 and 6 doesnt fit that trope Pat
[0:37:35] <%Uselesswhitenoise> can't wait for re lab
[0:37:35] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[0:37:36] <+MK_Ineptitude> RE9: Castle
[0:37:36] <Tracazoid> LUL
[0:37:38] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Yeah considering all of the Umbrella stuff in it,theres so gonna be a lab
[0:37:40] <nobleclonetrooper> Shut up tho.
[0:37:41] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[0:37:41] <balthazar758> Resident Evil: Lab
[0:37:42] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:37:42] <+oda_flobunaga> HYPE go down
[0:37:43] <%AzureGale> So the next RE will be called castle?
[0:37:43] <%Jamejarrs> And second demo is Castle
[0:37:43] <$lumporr> i can't wait for Resident Evil: Lab
[0:37:44] <fat_burtreynolds> Dont forget to throw huey out da boat
[0:37:44] <%twistedj3ster> oh my gosh, the look in your eyes
[0:37:44] <BalloniWright> Can't wait for Reseident Evil Lab
[0:37:45] <mannywatcha> Quickly to the secret lab!!
[0:37:45] <Chatterbox1991> RE7 @PatStaresAt  Mansion, Boathouse, Barn, Ship.
[0:37:45] <+michingmallecho> So have I
[0:37:48] <Tham1k> So the next game is gonna be castle?
[0:37:49] <%Drunkengen> but when is RE9 STREETS
[0:37:50] <+michingmallecho> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:37:50] <+PunkMcFox> RE9 Castle, RE10 Lab
[0:37:50] <DSD24> But RE5 has Sun Lasers
[0:37:51] <CrimsonFox777> RE9 = Castle, REX = Lab, got it!
[0:37:52] <$Zalthia> @okamidude15 I was thinking it was way too soon for a new RE mainline game... But... Nope.
[0:37:52] <rufus2k2> @QuasarKnightGaming no just rambling abotu skunks and stuff
[0:37:53] <%DoktorZee> RE5 is literally that
[0:37:53] <%BigCoffee> village, sure
[0:37:54] <morow1ec> can't wait for Re9 Castle
[0:37:56] <%TheMattman1313> Don't forget 5 isn't "castle", it's werird ancient pyramid
[0:37:57] <lemon_lover28> 5 does, 6 not really
[0:37:57] <+superchronicc> re5 didnt go to a castle at all
[0:37:58] <Devbob98> They just wanted the cool hidden title
[0:37:58] <+panlakes> dont look at the camera it intimidates me
[0:37:58] <%Maids4lyfe> FIVE WAS IN A VILLAGE
[0:37:58] <+michingmallecho> Re5 have a village
[0:37:58] <%ssjklyco> 5 was literally a village
[0:37:58] <%Dakuu75> 6 has a graveyard. Idk about the others
[0:38:00] <placeholder03> RE10: Lab
[0:38:00] <%Frost_Quill> So we're absolutely finding a lab under the castle right?
[0:38:01] <%BigCoffee> the swamps?
[0:38:04] <Draleokong> Hey Leprachaun man just wanted to say hi for now
[0:38:05] <%Valdorick> RE5 100% fits that... and 6 is just bad so doesn't count psaDab
[0:38:07] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> RE14:B
[0:38:11] <s1rcuit> @patstaresat it's all the same and you love it
[0:38:11] <scht3v3> It might be village castle SEWERS lab this time
[0:38:14] <bob900000> what about revelations 2
[0:38:18] <%patriotrenegade> SWAMP
[0:38:19] <naoi0> RE5 the return of foreign culure?
[0:38:19] <Chatterbox1991> 7?
[0:38:20] <MusouMiko> even 7 fits it
[0:38:21] <+tempestzephyr> African Aztec LUL
[0:38:22] <susukouhai> this is why 6 is the bad game
[0:38:23] <Meekest> RE7?
[0:38:24] <cardamomo88> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:38:27] <CappuccinoGuil> and it's also divided into 4 campaigns
[0:38:28] <atgithursdays> You are stretching the definition of "castle" a lot
[0:38:28] <thelonechris> You mean when you were shooting spear-throwing dude in grass huts?
[0:38:30] <yourliteraldog> Not mainline
[0:38:32] <%Drunkengen> PRISON
[0:38:35] <marvel877> and that's why 6 sucked.
[0:38:35] <%Monkeyweed21> why was there an Aztec temple in Africa?
[0:38:37] <smuggleruncle> in 6 you can make it fit
[0:38:38] <+TheotherKristian> Village Castle Lab
[0:38:38] <%patriotrenegade> village, swamp, refinery, aztec ruins, lab, boat
[0:38:38] <StevenNewJersey> what about the movie, it was all lab
[0:38:38] <SeelessButts> What about Final Fantasy 11
[0:38:39] <Aydarkzero> Prison
[0:38:40] <CandyCoatedConfection> that is the loudest snoring dog I've ever heard.
[0:38:41] <%BigCoffee> isnt it the mega swamps and lake, then the underground old nation sanctuary, then the old lab, then volcano (ok doesnt count here)
[0:38:41] <%caramelatte1> Island then Lab
[0:38:43] <%Maids4lyfe> 7 WAS MANSION SALT MINE LAB
[0:38:44] <hot4dukat> Re9: Castle
[0:38:47] <crazypsico55> Did I miss gameplay?
[0:38:49] <naoi0> Alcatraz?
[0:38:49] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Prisons also show up a lot
[0:38:50] <XeroSigmaPrime> Prison, City, Village, LAb Mansion
[0:38:50] <+Queenemereldas> code veronica?
[0:38:50] <anAngryHamster> RE6 strayed the furthest from the formula and look how that turned out
[0:38:51] <+CookieCutter007> umbrella corps :)
[0:38:52] <Aydarkzero> Rev 2 is just Arkham City LUL
[0:38:53] <Chatterbox1991> 7 is Guest House Mansion, Boathouse, Barn, Ship, Lab
[0:38:55] <%Dakuu75> a prison is basically a castle. it's just 99% dungeon
[0:38:57] <AstrodropGaming> RE6 had too many levels, that was its big problem
[0:38:57] <%bustawof> does that make the mansion the village Kappa
[0:39:00] <%Uselesswhitenoise> they should start you in a lab in ne of these games
[0:39:00] <%bevyrage> RE6 has one of the storylines that leads from an abandoned village to a reinforced building that then hides the secret lab though
[0:39:01] <$lumporr> Swamp, House, Sludge
[0:39:01] <CappuccinoGuil> @Meekest you start in the Baker house, go out to the boat, return to house, go through the mines (which is Lucas' lab)
[0:39:02] <OkamiDude15> RE:X where you work as an umbrella scientist in a lab and need to evacuate to the castle and then go to the village
[0:39:04] <%Uselesswhitenoise> space lab
[0:39:05] <Devbob98> Reverse though
[0:39:05] <DSD24> Boat!
[0:39:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> it'd be weird to start with Lab
[0:39:08] <+darkpulse703> swamp
[0:39:08] <+panlakes> what about devil may cry?
[0:39:08] <CarOden> @SeelessButts What do you want to know about FF11
[0:39:11] <+GrandmasterBFunk> House Forest Lab
[0:39:20] <tsuchi7> is it really just one 30 min gameplay then thats it?
[0:39:21] <fat_burtreynolds> Evil within 2 had that same layout
[0:39:21] <SomeOtherNeb> LUL
[0:39:23] <Calek> boats on water are basically sewers
[0:39:26] <fritz_dacat> Dothe CGI movies also follow those steps
[0:39:26] <%captain_thickthighs> @patstaresat bloodborne starts in a biolab then village then castle etc.
[0:39:28] <Ethel9727> "The boat is on water so it's like a sewer."
[0:39:31] <Aydarkzero> wait what?
[0:39:32] <Sotetsu> I like house over town
[0:39:34] <%Drunkengen> Wai is that why its called Resident Evil
[0:39:35] <$lumporr> mines, where we research how to get rocks
[0:39:35] <%Frost_Quill> Damn it it totally does argh.
[0:39:36] <nobleclonetrooper> Boat is on the water so it's like a Sewer.... that's a stretch.
[0:39:39] <Devbob98> This game is going do village, castle, caves, castle and lab
[0:39:41] <%ssjklyco> lab is just hell
[0:39:42] <Aydarkzero> that's weird
[0:39:44] <+panlakes> dude.... true
[0:39:45] <%JoshManVGH> Onimusha has that formual
[0:39:45] <ScreamLord> Because DMC1 was gonna be RE4
[0:39:45] <cardamomo88> LUL LUL
[0:39:46] <%Niney_Who> Hell is Demon Lab uh huh
[0:39:49] <doublemasteramerica> So technically RE4 follows the DMC1 formula?
[0:39:50] <+darkpulse703> 5Head
[0:39:53] <theshillman> that sounds like stretching it
[0:39:53] <korpocalypse> so the formula is what again?
[0:39:53] <1matheuw> great to see we're still on this
[0:39:54] <neon_z1> HELL = LAB
[0:39:55] <placeholder03> What about Haunting Ground?
[0:39:56] <MusouMiko> swamp is basically a sewer
[0:39:56] <Sotetsu> When is RE8 coming out?
[0:39:57] <%Cozy90> Pat you hyped for House of the dead remake?
[0:40:00] <%ssjklyco> Even the escape timer
[0:40:03] <BalloniWright> Hell Lab
[0:40:03] <%Frost_Quill> DMC1 was gonna be RE4!?
[0:40:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Every game secretly follows this formula
[0:40:04] <+Gespens> Isn't DMC2 City -> Military Base -> Castle?
[0:40:05] <+darkpulse703> What about Mon Hun Capcom game? Kappa
[0:40:07] <korpocalypse> I wanna make a dnd campaign out of this formula what was the formula
[0:40:08] <+oda_flobunaga> What about Room, Hallway, Bathroom, Hallway, Room
[0:40:08] <%Niney_Who> Haunting Ground does have a lab
[0:40:08] <+DynDimAcsiwn> your brain is so big right now
[0:40:08] <SMuffinMan> @doublemasteramerica DMC1 follows the RE1 formula
[0:40:08] <OkamiDude15> hell is lab spelled backwards
[0:40:08] <Lord_Magtok> Hell is just Satan's laboratory.
[0:40:09] <CappuccinoGuil> So we're going to spend 30 minutes in Lady D's bedroom,  right?
[0:40:10] <%bassoontyphoon> Did I miss the demo?
[0:40:14] <%Cozy90> oh ok :(
[0:40:16] <1matheuw> dmc 3 works kinda like that if you squint enough
[0:40:19] <$SGrim> @neon_z1 its where the demons are made
[0:40:20] <Ethel9727> @doublemasteramerica Oh god that's true
[0:40:22] <$lumporr> it's timeless
[0:40:24] <%Niney_Who> THE LOIYFE CYKUL
[0:40:25] <+superchronicc> house of the dead is dope
[0:40:26] <korpocalypse> wait what was the formula @PatStaresAt NotLikeThis
[0:40:28] <thelonechris> When's Overkill 2?
[0:40:33] <$Timesteel> sinden light gun
[0:40:35] <Devbob98> But it dumb fun
[0:40:36] <VvTacoSaladvV> Remake Typing of the Dead
[0:40:37] <$lumporr> the old house of the dead is just fine
[0:40:38] <SMuffinMan> Yup
[0:40:39] <Meekest> Thats why the Wii existed
[0:40:42] <$lumporr> shout out to time crisis on the PS1
[0:40:45] <%wibbwobbler> tru
[0:40:45] <+CookieCutter007> typing of the dead though
[0:40:45] <%CalderGaming> Suffer Like G Did
[0:40:46] <+xBolts4Lifex> D:
[0:40:46] <%Dakuu75> we jsut need to buy our own light-gun cabnets
[0:40:47] <%BigCoffee> what if you use the switch remotes as a gun?
[0:40:47] <+darkpulse703> PogChamp OLED
[0:40:49] <ProjektRF> sinden lightgun, Pat
[0:40:51] <DSD24> Suffer like G did
[0:40:51] <%TheMattman1313> GOLDMAN!!
[0:40:51] <Laecerelius> I mean the Wii could do some good lightgun stuff
[0:40:52] <%AzureGale> ok
[0:40:52] <SMuffinMan> HotD on PC is just cheating
[0:40:53] <Aydarkzero> wouldn't it just use the switch motion control?
[0:40:54] <JustYudha> You don't like VR?
[0:40:54] <aiutare47> there was one of those cabinets in my local pizza place and it spooked me as a kid, thats all I know
[0:40:55] <%Drunkengen> Its like they are inviting me in
[0:40:55] <%Frost_Quill> There's totally gonna be a "Stop being a creep." achievement in Lady D's bedroom.
[0:40:55] <%Mendin> Don't they still  have dangling plot hooks from like HotD3 thety need to tie up?
[0:40:56] <+redyoshi5> sinden light gun supposedly fixes that
[0:40:57] <OkamiDude15> release typing of the dead 2 in the west
[0:40:57] <%emperordread> Suffer like G did
[0:40:58] <+DarkNerdShawny> Isnt it only on Switch with the motion cons?
[0:40:59] <%SaiyanShoto> The Wii and PS3 ones are good
[0:41:01] <Aydarkzero> or is it confirmed cursor only
[0:41:04] <Wakiza97> @PatStaresAt they have a solution for light guns on new LCD/LED tv's
[0:41:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Typing of the Dead FUCKS
[0:41:05] <%Cozy90> IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.... FRIENDS
[0:41:05] <%Dementedpenguin> Cursor on the screen is not the same as shooting with a light gun. I miss those games.
[0:41:07] <%BigCoffee> The Wii resident evil games are actually good
[0:41:07] <Calek> switch motion control and light guns are completely different
[0:41:11] <korpocalypse> what was the formula with the castles? @PatStaresAt
[0:41:12] <OldManDeckardCain> *MAX WILL REMEMBER THAT*
[0:41:15] <Wakiza97> @PatStaresAt They are super hard to get tho
[0:41:16] <cardamomo88> just play duck hunt
[0:41:17] <$lumporr> what if Typing Game was a popular genre

[0:41:28] <%SaiyanShoto> There are light guns for current tv's

[0:42:20] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt How many runs of the demo are you planning to do, or is it just one tonight?
[0:42:22] <DSD24> Chris is J Talbain
[0:42:23] <thelonechris> It should have just been Resident Evil Engine
[0:42:23] <%Monkeyweed21> chris stop calling my period the LOIF COYCLE
[0:42:23] <$Zalthia> If Chris is a werewolf, does that mean he has a fursona?
[0:42:25] <+michingmallecho> it was cool. It’s basically a taste of RE8, no wonder it’s a 30 minute limit
[0:42:29] <%MechArch> Why Chris Viking man?
[0:42:29] <rufus2k2> turn on subtitles
[0:42:29] <%Frost_Quill> "He turned himself into a werewolf and killed my girlfriend so I'd bang his sister, he's crazy."
[0:42:30] <%ExpressNode> I'm glad I put a SSD in my PS4 Pro it helps with games like these
[0:42:32] <1matheuw> no japanese for the ara ara?
[0:42:40] <%TheBensonator_> RE TO THE MOOOOOOOOON
[0:42:46] <scht3v3> @smuggleruncle I thought the pc demo was going to be in may, was it not?
[0:42:47] <BalloniWright> what languages are in the demo?
[0:42:47] <%watts121> watts121 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[0:42:49] <korpocalypse> what was the formula?
[0:42:49] <SomeOtherNeb> but if you give them your data maybe Vampire Lady can find you
[0:42:50] <+panlakes> will Ethan evolve further into the godlike being the world has set out for him to become?
[0:42:53] <Devbob98> You can spend time in menu, timer doesn’t start
[0:42:57] <%DoktorZee> psaHoldon
[0:43:00] <rufus2k2> how often does RE get japanese dubs
[0:43:03] <rufus2k2> if ever
[0:43:03] <%Frost_Quill> Imagine if the time started at the title screen.
[0:43:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea options!
[0:43:06] <bettysharkface> Has there been an RE on the moon yet?
[0:43:08] <rufus2k2> SUBTITLES
[0:43:08] <Aydarkzero> after playing the demo i might turn off adaptive triggers LUL
[0:43:09] <smuggleruncle> @scht3v3 hmm ill need to check on that
[0:43:09] <placeholder03> Wheres the giant eyeball?
[0:43:11] <+xBolts4Lifex> Ray Tracing :O
[0:43:14] <SMuffinMan> After playing Doom Eternal this game felt so slow lmao. Creepy tho
[0:43:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> Oh man they have the giant timer in the corner from the start
[0:43:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> good, Pat is still talking, I just got kicked out of my demo
[0:43:21] <+TheotherKristian> Doesn't ray traycing mean 45fps?
[0:43:21] <Vaunno> play in japanese for 100% more ara ara
[0:43:24] <%RoboticAnimeDude> 45 fps RT mode ftw
[0:43:26] <%watts121> Ray Tracing is just a cheap trick by graphic cards that aren't Radeon!
[0:43:26] <Draleokong> We gonna see big BOOBA vampire Lady in this demo?
[0:43:27] <%bassoontyphoon> A little loud
[0:43:28] <Lord_Magtok> No cool narrator shouting RESIDENT EVIL, lame.
[0:43:28] <T_Sasquatch> why can he play and I cant ?
[0:43:28] <mannywatcha> Look at that scarescrow.
[0:43:29] <+xBolts4Lifex> Ray tracing drop it to 30 fps?
[0:43:30] <tanarath> @patstaresat menu time might not count for the 30m limit.
[0:43:32] <s1rcuit> I made the mistake of not playing halo 4 without subtitles, I have no idea what the plot of halo 4 is as a result

[0:54:20] <FatherGreyBeard> This music makes me think of the first Ganado theme
[0:54:22] <%charp35> So re4 remake is clearly just going to be this game in third person
[0:54:23] <+boogaleeboo> They really want you to guard and dump bullets
[0:54:24] <soundcloud_raptor> 30-50 feral cavemen

[0:54:43] <+TEANTACLES> @SomeOtherNeb what happened?
[0:54:43] <AoG_JarlRaven> what tactical training has Ethan Winters undergone?
[0:54:46] <+michingmallecho> this game definitely has Resident evil 4 influence
[0:54:48] <+MackFighters> "flour"
[0:54:49] <+shradke> Bullet sponging isn’t a good way to make enemie scary
[0:54:50] <%Draleokong> Goddamn crackheads in Europe i thought that was just america
[0:54:52] <acratese> He's actually going to find it wow
[0:54:53] <%Caped_Eggy> I bet there are gems in those flour bags
[0:54:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Load the shells into your handgun
[0:54:58] <%Dakuu75> time to backtrack all ready? lol
[0:55:00] <%toolofparanoia> How long has Pat been playing the demo?
[0:55:01] <+Tacos_Bob> isnt flour flamable?
[0:55:04] <Hellarussian> wow
[0:55:06] <thelonechris> YEYEYE
[0:55:08] <morningmoondude> why so much flour?
[0:55:08] <rufus2k2> aw yiiiiiiiis
[0:55:10] <+darkpulse703> monkaS Flour bomb
[0:55:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so as a warning, the shotgun only has ONE shot in it, so be glad you found the ammo
[0:55:11] <%Alig200> @TEANTACLES aren't they just collectibles, breaking them all in the full game probably unlocks something.
[0:55:12] <%Dakuu75> dude, that is a nice looking shotgun
[0:55:12] <mannywatcha> Good gun
[0:55:12] <SomeOtherNeb> @TEANTACLES nothing clear for now
[0:55:13] <%toolofparanoia> SHOTGUN ACQUIRED
[0:55:16] <FatherGreyBeard> SHOTGUN
[0:55:16] <+CarissMcbober> I do not understand the point of the flour
[0:55:21] <eustine> like 7 min
[0:55:22] <aiutare47> that looks like an soviet anti tank mine?!
[0:55:22] <%Monkeyweed21> MINELAYER
[0:55:23] <rufus2k2> dust explosions can occur, yes
[0:55:24] <%Drunkengen> SHOTGUN GET
[0:55:26] <%Caped_Eggy> Jesus, they are throwing everything at you this early
[0:55:26] <+michingmallecho> shit, I didn’t find the shotgun, I just ran through BibleThump
[0:55:26] <1matheuw> can you knife the flour?
[0:55:27] <+Kashishh> damn i never found the shotgun
[0:55:27] <%Fenrisulfr_V> What a clean shotgun.
[0:55:29] <$SGrim> Grenades? LAND MINES! KKona
[0:55:29] <+TEANTACLES> @SomeOtherNeb cool, thx
[0:55:30] <AoG_JarlRaven> very nice etchings on that shotgun
[0:55:31] <TioXyco> wow, that shotgn reminds me of Alien Trilogy on the PS1 LUL
[0:55:34] <+Tacos_Bob> wheat field=flour
[0:55:34] <%fat_burtreynolds> Land mine too?
[0:55:36] <doublemasteramerica> Flour is combustible in the right circumstances
[0:55:36] <%Draleokong> "Gun your my only friend"
[0:55:36] <Devbob98> I didn’t even know their was a shotgun in demo
[0:55:37] <%toolofparanoia> That shotgun has engravings!
[0:55:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the Lycan ate me up, not going down in nearly as many hits as I wanted
[0:55:39] <+DkLordG> you use flour to bake
[0:55:40] <EynosStyles> a shotgun the bestest of friends
[0:55:41] <+OhioNitsud> shake hands with gun
[0:55:41] <Pandybun> I like the sound it makes when you switch pages
[0:55:42] <Meekest> That's VERY RE4
[0:55:43] <%badfleshboy> Sweet now I can stop backseat gaming
[0:55:45] <+TensecondTarvis> map looks like it tells you when area is clear too
[0:55:47] <Big_Dream> die she still have the nagic healing juice
[0:55:48] <thelonechris> That's not at all alarming
[0:55:48] <ZE_Count> maybe wolf hates flour in nose?
[0:55:49] <%Emperor_Machinus> Friendship with handgun ended, shotgun new best friend
[0:55:53] <Thepothero> Fucking landmines LUL
[0:55:55] <+Tacos_Bob> resident flour
[0:55:56] <Big_Dream> does he still have the nagic healing juice
[0:55:58] <%Dakuu75> @CarissMcbober it says "use for cloud cover" maybe it's like throwing pocket sand at enemies when you shoot it close to them. idk
[0:55:58] <corepercentlives> in Re4 you also get shotgun very early
[0:55:58] <%twistedj3ster> @D grass?
[0:55:58] <puse9> how do you like the demo so far?
[0:55:59] <%Monkeyweed21> now you are Luis

[0:56:02] <Big_Dream> does he still have the magic healing juice
[0:56:10] <%twistedj3ster> *2D
[0:56:11] <SomeOtherNeb> ooh that shotgun looks like it feels good
[0:56:14] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Engravings give you no tactical advantages
[0:56:14] <soundcloud_raptor> good shotgun
[0:56:15] <xeros720> real ganado energy these guys
[0:56:20] <naoi0> Headshots for days
[0:56:21] <thelonechris> Hairy crackheads
[0:56:21] <%Draleokong> Who is making all the crack for these fuckers
[0:56:22] <hakumaribo> a reminder irl, shotguns only hold 3 - 4 rounds depending on the type,  you have ot manually remove a part to allow it to hold more and its not actual legal.
[0:56:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's timed, he can't answer
[0:56:25] <Hellarussian> these dudes are tough as shit
[0:56:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> DIE MOTHER FUCKER
[0:56:28] <%Dakuu75> CRITICAL HIT
[0:56:29] <sirtommygunn> headshot didn't even make him flinch
[0:56:30] <doublemasteramerica> NO SILVER BULLETS NO XP!
[0:56:31] <+critikal_bit> Strong bois
[0:56:32] <%toolofparanoia> gottem
[0:56:32] <+xBolts4Lifex> love the music
[0:56:34] <rufus2k2> at least they popped
[0:56:35] <+panlakes> Half these zombwolves know how to juke, the other half get stuck on terrain lul
[0:56:40] <+skull522> When the shotgun launches dudes, you know its good
[0:56:40] <%Eilocke> infinitely cooler than molded. god i hated the molded
[0:56:42] <%walternatorz> they've got the right sound for skulls exploding
[0:56:44] <rufus2k2> also that gun is probably garbage til upgraded
[0:56:46] <%Sausious> [robably tuned up for the demo
[0:56:47] <1matheuw> i though you needed silver to kill lycans
[0:56:49] <Laecerelius> Beefy bois
[0:56:49] <+MackFighters> you're running outta time pat
[0:56:51] <+CarissMcbober> @Dakuu75 To blind them so you can stealth by them? Maybe, but this guys seem dangerous to just leave alive.
[0:56:52] <mannywatcha> Thank god they drop loot then cause boy they are gonna be bullet sponges.
[0:56:54] <Pandybun> I think one of them threw something at you so they might throw objects to stun you
[0:56:56] <%Dakuu75> @Eilocke for real
[0:56:59] <RaccoonBoy> goat
[0:57:00] <aiutare47> @hakumaribo Unless you live in the US and extending tubes is fun and cool
[0:57:01] <%0oki> what difficulty are you playing on?
[0:57:02] <%fat_burtreynolds> I can tell you’ve been playing fortnite haha
[0:57:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yep, Lycan messed me up, I didn't want to watch Shotgun ammo
[0:57:05] <naoi0> Quick shoot that child
[0:57:06] <%donbomber777> Seems to be a massive improvement over the molded
[0:57:06] <naoi0> oh
[0:57:06] <%SaiyanShoto> Dammit my demo ended in the middle of a cutscene LUL
[0:57:07] <%BigCoffee> Are th graphics kinda bad? This still looks like re7 moreso then a ps5 game
[0:57:07] <+xen0riddley> @Eilocke the molded would have been better if there were more than just 4 of them
[0:57:08] <Devbob98> What’s his time at
[0:57:09] <naoi0> It's a woman
[0:57:10] <soundcloud_raptor> clodor
[0:57:11] <+panlakes> maybe they come back to life until later in the game when you get silver ammo
[0:57:15] <%za7az> @1matheuw Enough bullets will kill anything
[0:57:15] <rufus2k2> i live here dumbass
[0:57:16] <Devbob98> Listen to her voice Pat

[0:57:49] <%Dakuu75> just for ONCE I would like to see ppl GLAD to see an "Outsider"
[0:57:50] <doublemasteramerica> @hakumaribo that's highly dependent on the make and model of the specific shotgun and legality is highly subject by locales and nation
[0:57:51] <Pandybun> Hey there are cloves of garlic
[0:57:52] <%Dementedpenguin> Normal people in an RE game? Uh oh >_>
[0:57:52] <Devbob98> It’s Jill’s voice actor from re 3
[0:57:54] <theredlotus_> Speaking in English so that the outsider can understand everything.
[0:57:55] <lemon_lover28> why are they speaking english?

[0:58:45] <%dkzk21> Re4 vibes are even stronger than i expected
[0:58:47] <+xen0riddley> @SGrim god, that's worse than being in "Rural Europe"

[1:08:35] <EynosStyles> harem acquired
[1:08:35] <%bassoontyphoon> Ethan probably resistant due to mold

[1:08:38] <ZE_Count> Ethan got that immunity from the bayou
[1:08:38] <+funkyjim69> but how do you become a MonStar?
[1:08:38] <Dmorktry> Kinda crazy how this game predicted the pandemic

[1:08:46] <Lutre> ethan is riddled with mould like a potato salad, so he's fine
[1:08:46] <%Cozy90> pot o gold
[1:08:47] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[1:08:48] <Meekest> That Julian guy is gonna be pissed
[1:08:50] <mannywatcha> It didn't help them that they were praying to satan either.
[1:08:50] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt maybe it's bacterial this time
[1:08:53] <+superchronicc> my eyes have been oipened
[1:08:54] <%Idziman> Idziman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! man, four years already. thanks for all that entertainment for so long, Patster
[1:08:55] <bettysharkface> Might also be a "they're all already infected, they just have to die" sorta deal
[1:08:55] <$RenegadeHatter> Just like the old Gypsy Woman said WutFace
[1:08:56] <%Dakuu75> Damn healing church is fucking around with blood again

[1:09:04] <$SGrim> Ethan gemmed in Blight Resistance 3. PogChamp
[1:09:04] <scarman125> @captain_thickthighs I don't think Ethan boned his duaghter
[1:09:06] <%SaiyanShoto> Ethan has that mold blood, he's probably immune
[1:09:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Who keeps a key in the drawer next to the sink?

[1:09:18] <Jaysky> That sound effect for finding a screwdriver is a little over the top
[1:09:21] <+impressionistcowboy> lol ethan has 3 stooges syndrome
[1:09:22] <KingKrampus> @renegadehatter roma. gypsy is a slur
[1:09:22] <%Drunkengen> Why do they play the sary music when you found a new item?

[1:09:26] <%JoshManVGH> So as Bio-curses go... werewolf seems pretty badass. you could still possibly buy pants!
[1:09:27] <Talen99> I would actually love it if Ethan is immune to this games evil because he's chock full of the last games evil
[1:09:28] <+darkpulse703> Either Zombie, Vampire or Weredoggo virus mopNote
[1:09:29] <Devbob98> What’s his time

[1:09:31] <+impressionistcowboy> so many hell viruses they just can't get through

[1:09:36] <%ssjklyco> don't worry, the fire won't spread until you escape
[1:09:38] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Shotgun will never leave you.
[1:09:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> M1897 Shotgun in real life gets either 5 or 6 shots, I forget

[1:09:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> probably seconds left
[1:09:47] <Ethel9727> I would absolutely love if it became canon that Ethan had *just enough* mold in his blood to be a super badass without getting taken over.
[1:09:47] <CappuccinoGuil> DO SOME SICK DONUTS
[1:09:48] <%mads_valentine> It's a piece of shit.

[1:09:52] <ulcaban> Grab those chilli peppers!
[1:09:53] <%Cozy90> now she will disappear
[1:09:53] <%Deft_Thought> What are the odds that engine actually turns over

[1:10:52] <StarlitStunner> The best plan
[1:10:52] <Jaysky> THen stop talking
[1:10:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Everyone knows smoke sticks to the ground.
[1:10:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ethan is so dumb
[1:10:55] <+UnabashedGarbage> DO NOT FOLLOW THAT ADVICE CHAT
[1:10:56] <SomeOtherNeb> oh yeah just breathe the non-smokey air

[1:11:10] <Ethel9727> What if Ethan gets infected by this new thing too and ends up becoming the ULTTIMATE BIOWEAPON
[1:11:11] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Fire can't climb
[1:11:12] <%captain_thickthighs> maybe had to turn around
[1:11:13] <Lord_Magtok> Wait if they have a truck why isn't there a garage door or something for it to leave through?

[1:13:49] <%cache_22> Jebaited
[1:13:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ethan wasn't there for that
[1:13:50] <%Frost_Quill> Chris was there, he punched down the boards so she'd fall.  No women other than his sister must be near Ethan.

[1:14:17] <%Tman451> You were very close

[1:14:19] <Zap_Rowsdower32> You were almost at the end
[1:14:20] <BalloniWright> You missed Miranda
[1:14:20] <%Eilocke> why time limit a demo that's already so limited?
[1:14:20] <Meekest> Like 20 seconds

[1:14:22] <%BestTeaMaker> no
[1:14:23] <+condemned_15> let me guess: Spencer is tied to Mother Miranda in some way
[1:14:24] <acratese> All he had to do was walk down the hill and open the gate
[1:14:24] <%weissguard> Like, insert thing into door and roll trailer.
[1:14:24] <%DoktorZee> no
[1:14:24] <%StebTheVee> no
[1:14:25] <+illusiveSaint> same thing

[1:14:26] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Nope
[1:14:26] <cbdhempwraps> that shit is aggravating
[1:14:27] <Reanimator83> no
[1:14:27] <doublemasteramerica> Wasn't a whole city filled with zombies and hunters then wiped out by a solar satellite in revelations
[1:14:27] <Pandybun> What is his weapon? Like a clock staff?
[1:14:27] <%ssjklyco> speed run
[1:14:27] <Mr_JustinJones> you didn't miss anything
[1:14:28] <acratese> Same trailer
[1:14:28] <+GameOver_Here> That's Nicoli's voice actor
[1:14:29] <EynosStyles> @rendingmelody That's good lol
[1:14:29] <+KaijuUltimax> You see Mother Miranda
[1:14:30] <%thelaxinator> probably just had to get the seal and slot it in
[1:14:30] <xhawkeyeninja> no
[1:14:30] <%JoshManVGH> !uptime
[1:14:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 14m.
[1:14:30] <+TrixxImp> Like a minute away
[1:14:31] <+thegreenbenis> Bout 30 seconds.
[1:14:31] <+glumz> you grab the other emblem and open the castle gate
[1:14:31] <%caramelatte1> 1 minute of content
[1:14:32] <Zap_Rowsdower32> It just ends as you enter the castle
[1:14:32] <mar_krow> Remember Ethan said why is everyone dying around me again is Mia dead
[1:14:33] <+xen0riddley> that dude with the hammer dragging Ethan seems like he's gonna be a cool dude
[1:14:33] <+glumz> the end
[1:14:34] <%BigCoffee> thats a dissapointing demo
[1:14:34] <cactusdt> RE 8 DEMO ANY% LETS GOOO
[1:14:34] <+michingmallecho> Skipping and just blowing bast everything it took me 7 minutes
[1:14:35] <theredlotus_> There was only the part where you need to use both crests. After that the demo ends anyway.
[1:14:35] <+Teais4cups> You made it like 2 mins longer  than me
[1:14:35] <%floniac> You were like 2 mins
[1:14:36] <+Terran_Gell> put things in gate, demo end.
[1:14:36] <PinoProxie> alright
[1:14:36] <Improv1> A few minutes left at most
[1:14:37] <ngb1423> ruined
[1:14:38] <+glumz> nothing lost
[1:14:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's it? Seriously?!
[1:14:39] <%baka_sugoi> M O O N
[1:14:39] <+DkLordG> no, same trailer
[1:14:39] <%SaiyanShoto> I ran out of time like 10 seconds after you
[1:14:40] <Devbob98> Nope you put pieces in and it end s
[1:14:40] <doublemasteramerica> (you had like eh a few minutes)
[1:14:41] <Capseetra> fitzCozy
[1:14:43] <mannywatcha> Damn they are so short
[1:14:45] <XeroSigmaPrime> Cool cutscene at the end of demo tho @PatStaresAt
[1:14:45] <Mr_JustinJones> you open a door and it ends
[1:14:45] <+Pendragwn> @Eilocke to force hype
[1:14:46] <Improv1> Nothing new
[1:14:46] <Aydarkzero> it's very lite
[1:14:46] <+KingpinLarry> I got to putting the pieces in the gate, then it cut out.
[1:14:47] <+funkyjim69> He missed a little bit
[1:14:47] <AtticusofBronne> Looks neat
[1:14:48] <+balkonas1> They showed mother miranda behind that gate
[1:14:49] <%caramelatte1> you see a character
[1:14:52] <%hrbeck_> NTR'd
[1:14:53] <%Drunkengen> It barely showed anything
[1:14:53] <%TheMattman1313> You burned down a a house and killed 8 people to get a screwdriver, good job Ethan!
[1:14:54] <%JoshManVGH> Was that an hour?
[1:14:56] <+panlakes> it's smart but disappointing, I agree
[1:14:57] <@SSaryn> Just give me a fucking demo?
[1:14:57] <T_Sasquatch> How is it smart ??
[1:14:58] <+darkpulse703> Graphics look good
[1:14:58] <+Jack8274> It leaves you wanting more
[1:14:58] <+NiktenKing> the only other thing is that a horde spawns when you go back outside before letting in the two people indoors
[1:14:59] <Dr_Mooose> did I come in at the end?
[1:15:00] <Mr_JustinJones> This demo sucked
[1:15:01] <%Dementedpenguin> There was a lot of scripted moments.
[1:15:01] <theshillman> i gotta say, slow child singing has got to go i am so tired of it
[1:15:02] <thelonechris> I do not think the shotgun is going to be right there to pick up
[1:15:03] <%floniac> You get to see mother Miranda
[1:15:04] <+illusiveSaint> you didn't miss anything pat
[1:15:05] <Meekest> It said you could go in the castle though right?
[1:15:06] <CappuccinoGuil> @JoshManVGH 30 minutes
[1:15:06] <trianglehat> slurp
[1:15:06] <%twistedj3ster> there was very little gameplay in that demo
[1:15:06] <wolfen091> suzi pointed out that louise is one of the dead girls you find in the other demo, same model at least
[1:15:06] <%Mathochism> LITTLE BROTHER

[1:15:17] <trianglehat> Ethan tastes a little moldy I think
[1:15:17] <%radda343> You get a taste of all three parts: exploration, story, and shootbangs
[1:15:17] <%hrbeck_> booba
[1:15:19] <+balkonas1> Mother miranda was behind the gate
[1:15:19] <huskarl_zap> THE WHOLE FIST
[1:15:22] <Pandybun> I wonder who D's brother is
[1:15:22] <acratese> You see a person die
[1:15:23] <%hax_metatron> This demo looks bad. Nothing entices me about the game other than big lady
[1:15:25] <missingangle> They fucking know, goddammit
[1:15:26] <Ethel9727> Is Dimitrescu going to get the mold by succing Ethan?
[1:15:26] <%Piemen99> HOT
[1:15:27] <Meteor719> You get a peak at the big bad and thats all ya missed

[1:15:33] <AhmCha> bro they know exactly what they're doing
[1:15:34] <+boogaleeboo> That asshole with the hammer is probably her brother
[1:15:36] <%toolofparanoia> LYCANS
[1:15:36] <antshadow14> max cosplay
[1:15:38] <CrimsonFox777> The games?
[1:15:39] <%SaiyanShoto> There's mother miranda in the back
[1:15:40] <%Alig200> the four heads of the houses.
[1:15:40] <naoi0> Oh cool a sniper
[1:15:44] <tzuin21> 3 enemies Kappa
[1:15:44] <aiutare47> What gun was that?
[1:15:45] <+captain_thickthighs> the truck just worked in that trailer
[1:15:46] <%weissguard> Having a playable demo with unlimited run time and a definitive end point would've been better, but hey.
[1:15:50] <shotgang86> mother miranda is the old lady calling it now
[1:15:50] <EynosStyles> it was Wesker the whole time
[1:15:51] <thedrunkenmerchant> This was just like the RE3 Remake demo
[1:15:52] <+panlakes> those were people on a conveyer belt in fucking Moria
[1:15:53] <+impressionistcowboy> oh man blood factory looks sick
[1:15:54] <+thegreenbenis> FRENCH RIFLE
[1:15:54] <%Dementedpenguin> everything outside of the demo looks cool
[1:15:55] <acratese> Chris has drip
[1:15:57] <%baka_sugoi> stinky crew
[1:15:58] <%Maids4lyfe> THAT'S JUST A BLOODBORNE
[1:15:58] <Gunnehsan> CHUNGUS
[1:15:59] <AoG_JarlRaven> that looked like a Metro Exodus monstar
[1:15:59] <%Dakuu75> So, that was a Village demo, now theres a castle demo?
[1:16:00] <+darkpulse703> Chris punches Ethan LUL
[1:16:00] <%californaya> I still don't understand why Ethan is special.
[1:16:01] <+oda_flobunaga> JASON!
[1:16:02] <%AzureGale> ETHAN WINTERS
[1:16:02] <+KingpinLarry> It's a one time shot. It was not clear to me that it was so.
[1:16:03] <+thegreenbenis> That was a French Rifle.
[1:16:04] <+lockbreaker> is Ethan the new Leon
[1:16:04] <+Ellila> Excited to see Lady Dimitrescu (AKA Biomomster) in action when she eventually turns into a horrific goo monster.
[1:16:05] <Talen99> BLOOOOODBOOOOOOORNE
[1:16:05] <+oda_flobunaga> Jason
[1:16:05] <CappuccinoGuil> They are REALLY pushing Ethan here
[1:16:08] <%SaiyanShoto> The fact they say his name so much in that part has me suspicious
[1:16:08] <+UnabashedGarbage> Why the fuck does everyone here know who Ethan is
[1:16:09] <+panlakes> why are there PEOPLe on a conveyor belt
[1:16:09] <waffleandman> no swole chris
[1:16:10] <naoi0> Did ethan basically become a legend for surviving 7?
[1:16:12] <+oda_flobunaga> JAAAASON
[1:16:13] <%MelBrooksKA> Did that kid with the shotgun die in the fire?
[1:16:15] <%bassoontyphoon> Matt Damon
[1:16:15] <Zeif00> EeTHAN
[1:16:15] <PinoProxie> "rose's baby"
[1:16:15] <Mr_JustinJones> It seems like Ethan will be more of a character in this game
[1:16:16] <EynosStyles> Your not the hero Ethan.... your the villain.
[1:16:16] <%Dakuu75> Who the fuck is Rose?
[1:16:18] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt he got a mold juice STD
[1:16:20] <+darkpulse703> Hunk PogChamp

[1:16:23] <s1rcuit> look at all that bloodborne nonsense
[1:16:24] <+JaseAdrift> Ethan is the unluckiest motherfucker
[1:16:24] <%toastybites> Ethan gets isekai'd into Bloodborne circa 2021
[1:16:25] <StarlitStunner> Castle Demo
[1:16:26] <ulcaban> Ethan Winters, Welcome to Die!
[1:16:26] <+NiktenKing> DO ME
[1:16:26] <shotgang86> D O  M E
[1:16:28] <susukouhai> CHRIS DO ME
[1:16:28] <%Frost_Quill> I can't believe Chris invented lycanthropy to get Ethan to fuck his sister.
[1:16:28] <%radda343> I bet the plot twist is gonna be Ethan looking in a mirror and he's actually Chris
[1:16:29] <CrimsonFox777> Oh yeah, Mia's dead.
[1:16:29] <@SoFarFetched> RoseMary's baby
[1:16:29] <acratese> Ethan is basically Leon but less cool
[1:16:30] <OkamiDude15> @MelBrooksKA probably
[1:16:30] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:16:31] <SolSwagGuy56> DO ME Kreygasm
[1:16:31] <critiquequartz> Is that the joke
[1:16:31] <%SaiyanShoto> That's his daughter
[1:16:31] <%AzureGale> Yes, Chris, do Ethan
[1:16:31] <PinoProxie> the baby is rose pat
[1:16:31] <%Ranryu692> the baby's name is Rose
[1:16:32] <%Deadpal> Cause the game said rose too.
[1:16:32] <SomeOtherNeb> Rose is baby name
[1:16:32] <%Niney_Who> That's his kid's name
[1:16:32] <%weissguard> Rose is Ethan's child
[1:16:32] <Laecerelius> CHRIIIIIIIIIS!!
[1:16:32] <%Agami23> rose IS the baby
[1:16:33] <Talen99> Was that Last of Us Joel?

[1:17:52] <%Dakuu75> the way I understood it, there was a demop that takes place in the village and one in the casstle? or are they different days?
[1:17:53] <+xen0riddley> @josnotforlewd wouldn't that result in the best timeline?
[1:17:53] <+black_pariah> just bought all of blazblue for 16 bucks
[1:17:58] <+DarkNerdShawny> He wasnt saying the demo sucks, he was saying the way its handle sucks
[1:18:04] <%fat_burtreynolds> Nobble hobbo
[1:18:06] <Devbob98> Rip Elena, too cool for Ethan
[1:18:12] <Arek_1> SourPls
[1:18:20] <Mr_JustinJones> Capcom said you can go as far as you can in 30minutes which is a fucking lie
[1:18:24] <%Alig200> @Dakuu75 yeah, thers a village demo, and a castle demo, both 30 minutes each. then they combine into one 60 minute demo.
[1:18:30] <aiutare47> Yo any firearm buffs recognize the rifle it showed for a second in the trailer? I didnt.
[1:18:35] <%JoshManVGH> The MonHunt demo was handled great, whats the deal with this?
[1:18:39] <corepercentlives> looked good to me, not excellent but got my interest up
[1:18:40] <user_naim> Is RE8 also going to have a dumb minecart rollercoaster?
[1:18:43] <%Dakuu75> @Alig200 ah ok. gotchya
[1:18:44] <+josnotforlewd> @xen0riddley it'd be so cool that I know it would never happen
[1:18:55] <mar_krow> Pieres broke Chris
[1:18:57] <%Dementedpenguin> Not gonna lie, nothing about that demo made me want to buy RE8. (I'll play it though)
[1:19:26] <%Dakuu75> @mar_krow dude I liked Piers. he was my favorite dude from 6
[1:19:41] <%Daxalog> is it disco time?
[1:19:42] <mar_krow> Same
[1:19:43] <Blank9> jake and piers ruled
[1:19:45] <Blank9> fun to play as
[1:19:46] <Devbob98> I think it’s the first person aspect, doesn’t make me feel like it’s RE
[1:19:51] <Arek_1> SourPls
[1:19:57] <@SoFarFetched> yeah switching over to Disco Elysium
[1:19:58] <+lockbreaker> @blank9 big agree
[1:20:05] <%Daxalog> WOO!
[1:20:23] <+illusiveSaint> disco next?
[1:20:47] <rkytek> flip did i miss the demo?
[1:20:59] <sirtommygunn> yeah
[1:21:01] <theshillman> ye
[1:21:02] <+lockbreaker> @rkytek yep, I did too
[1:21:07] <%peachyprimrose> Yup
[1:21:15] <%toolofparanoia> You didn't miss much
[1:21:22] <+illusiveSaint> spoilers the demo sucked
[1:21:22] <rkytek> ahhhh well
[1:21:24] <sirtommygunn> it looks like RE8 will be good, unsurprisingly
[1:21:55] <rkytek> oh neat
[1:21:57] <Zollington> lol i got a patrón ad just now
[1:22:01] <ghoulspan> demo sucked ass
[1:22:35] <%toolofparanoia> i really wanna know who that father gascoigne looking guy is
[1:22:42] <aguynamedd> RPGYonger
[1:22:55] <sirtommygunn> i don't think RE's current formula works well for a short, time restricted demo
[1:23:07] <%invalid_robin> How did the demo suck?
[1:23:08] <%Dementedpenguin> the game as a whole looks interesting, but the demo itself felt like a bad representation.
[1:23:12] <%extradopeness> It was like ten minutes of gameplay bookended by the same trailer
[1:23:20] <%invalid_robin> Just because its time locked?
[1:23:50] <%toolofparanoia> encouraging people to try and speed run a horror game the first time is blah
[1:23:57] <%peachyprimrose> Just hope the game won't have as many moments where Ethan is doing nothing while interjecting his feelings while the player is sitting there like "wow, that character did a dumb and/or unsurprising thing"
[1:24:06] <sirtommygunn> a lot of the time is basically an extended cutscene
[1:24:24] <sirtommygunn> not much time to establish an atmosphere or get into the deeper game mechanics
[1:24:36] <%peachyprimrose> After 7 you'd think Ethan would be quicker to realize he's in danger and needs to move on
[1:24:58] <%toolofparanoia> I wanted to see the duke, aka new merchant
[1:24:59] <%cache_22> I am thinking this RE8 demo timing and split into parts is driven more on Sony+Capcom's partnership to get attention for the PS4/PS5 version and less about driving interest to the game.
[1:25:06] <%Tman451> Way too short
[1:25:09] <%TheMattman1313> It didn't seem that gRE8
[1:25:09] <ingman112> And a minute before the end too
[1:25:11] <%Tman451> The demo I mean
[1:25:11] <%toolofparanoia> its dumb!
[1:25:16] <@SoFarFetched> I feel it shouldn't count "scenes"
[1:25:16] <LorcaNomad> I just got here, was it bad?
[1:25:17] <%Deadpal> It seems like more of the same writing wise. Just torture porn.
[1:25:19] <wolfen091> pirate
[1:25:20] <marvel877> Time limit sucks.
[1:25:20] <Qsmash_> remember how great the re7 demo was
[1:25:21] <%za7az> Yeah
[1:25:22] <%walternatorz> you will enjoy your slice of bread until we give you another slice of bread
[1:25:26] <Devbob98> It was very railroad
[1:25:27] <@SoFarFetched> like if scenes are playing,the timer should pause
[1:25:30] <+RedLanternReview> I feel like the Castle one will be much better, this one was too Story heavy
[1:25:33] <sirtommygunn> yeah if it had a definitive end idk why they would time restrict it too
[1:25:38] <%BigCoffee> What did you think about the graphics? They looked kinda poor from my POV, but maybe my TV is old?
[1:25:41] <@SoFarFetched> cause scenes up eat up minutes
[1:25:42] <+TheotherKristian> You gonna watch the end on youtube?
[1:25:46] <%bassoontyphoon> 3.5 enemies
[1:25:50] <%walternatorz> you can't even progress forward, there's no point for the time limit
[1:25:54] <T_Sasquatch> New age marketing woooo
[1:26:00] <%weissguard> BIG Streams for Big Pats.
[1:26:00] <SoAndSoap> whats the smallest room you could see yourself living in?
[1:26:05] <%toolofparanoia> you pushing your limits
[1:26:06] <%BigCoffee> Isn't it weird that they said you could check castle or village in the demo?
[1:26:15] <%bassoontyphoon> D-I-s-c-o
[1:26:28] <+illusiveSaint> the timer is arbitrary and adds fake urgency
[1:26:34] <%Alig200> castle demo isn't until next week
[1:26:46] <%Quigsies> Hey Pat, just beat this game a few days ago, holy shit

[1:30:51] <%OrangeMDT> Pat x Dababy
[1:30:53] <penitentpendant> So, going through multiple playthroughs, it looks like your 'specialty' stat gives you bonuses on 'passive' checks
[1:30:56] <%walternatorz> when was the last time you updated your extensions?
[1:30:56] <wolfen091> really?  mines the rear admiral
[1:31:01] <%baka_sugoi> gottem
[1:31:06] <+Neon_Negro> "that aint dababy thats my baby" - Pat probably
[1:31:07] <%psidefx> Song when?
[1:31:10] <kazadaz> you're whirlin in rags, you're vast and you're sad
[1:31:12] <sirtommygunn> bed time
[1:31:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Volition is Your BFF even though its boring
[1:31:16] <ingman112> Doesn't look like it
[1:31:23] <%walternatorz> doesn't look like it
[1:31:24] <%torusendor> You don't
[1:31:26] <+RyanTheRecluse> nope
[1:31:28] <ingman112> You can see all the item bonuses on the side
[1:31:31] <%GarbageNirvana> He can see EVERYTHING
[1:31:31] <shotgang86> look at this loser
[1:31:33] <%emperordread> nope, on the left side of the screen it shows bonuses from items. Perception isn't on there
[1:31:34] <+turbothot666> hi pat i love your large bonce
[1:31:39] <slegg0> Don't forget to read the book
[1:31:39] <yourwebgod> im on my second play thru, love disco!
[1:31:41] <trianglehat> hobo with cyber legs
[1:31:42] <%logoth_> dont you hate PANTS??
[1:31:44] <kazadaz> One thing they should really patch is redoing the UI around clothes
[1:31:46] <%walternatorz> you may have perception from your thoughts
[1:31:50] <%torusendor> That's where the dick is
[1:31:51] <%cache_22> Those pants have seen things.
[1:31:57] <iosephe> pants love the drugs
[1:32:01] <kazadaz> Coats tend to have really good stats
[1:32:03] <sirtommygunn> He's got +5 from thoughts
[1:32:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Really gotta wonder what Kim's gonna say the moment he lays eyes on you in those boots
[1:32:07] <Blank9> authority rules
[1:32:09] <+oda_flobunaga> Finished a run last night, so beautifully depressing
[1:32:12] <%za7az> No
[1:32:30] <kazadaz> like all authority
[1:32:32] <LunarRemix> Authority is the best
[1:32:32] <user_naim> Most people start with intellect and psyche, huh. Me included. Doing a 2 2 4 4 character now though
[1:32:35] <%Chex868> i missed re demo what did pat think of it
[1:32:36] <yourliteraldog> well that fits
[1:32:40] <%Uselesswhitenoise> authority does exactly one really really good thing
[1:32:40] <baby_luigi83> hi
[1:32:41] <sirtommygunn> Authority is bad
[1:32:42] <penitentpendant> Authority is important later, so don't tank it completely
[1:32:43] <ingman112> I'd say just keep in mind how high perception is for now, and be ready to swap one of the two thoughts out in future
[1:32:46] <sirtommygunn> But also good
[1:32:52] <%Daxalog> Is your perception at "Too high" status right now?
[1:32:57] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i had -1 authority and my run went fine
[1:32:58] <%BigCoffee> What do the armored boots give
[1:33:00] <Blank9> bag + flashlight will let you pick up anything anywhere, besides locked stuff
[1:33:05] <+oda_flobunaga> yes
[1:33:07] <aiutare47> its getting there
[1:33:11] <aiutare47> not quite
[1:33:12] <TundraOW> What the fuck
[1:33:16] <%torusendor> LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
[1:33:17] <sirtommygunn> It's fine, you're fine
[1:33:18] <IminyourBase> he can hear bees fart
[1:33:19] <faegbeard> too high is just more content
[1:33:20] <%walternatorz> you likely got some from your thoughts
[1:33:21] <TundraOW> Pat can you see God?
[1:33:22] <aiutare47> Id say 11 is too high
[1:33:22] <%cache_22> That's psaBig perception.
[1:33:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Don't forget all the passive checks
[1:33:24] <%extradopeness> dude why did u take the boots im still so upset
[1:33:24] <%hax_metatron> Pat took DMT
[1:33:29] <yourliteraldog> what happens if a stat is too high
[1:33:35] <penitentpendant> Oh good, they patched the 'run the numbers' task to show it's timed before you start it
[1:33:35] <%bassoontyphoon> Perception has minimal drawbacks
[1:33:38] <%Uselesswhitenoise> i did a full ten to everything cheat run once
[1:33:41] <+upandadam> pat you got this case SOLVED
[1:33:42] <+illusiveSaint> i just realized actually holding the ledger gives you stats :(
[1:33:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt dont forget the novel
[1:33:45] <%invalid_robin> How did you get to 10 PERCEPTION
[1:33:47] <aiutare47> @yourliteraldog You can pass checks youd rather not
[1:33:48] <%Uselesswhitenoise> it was a lot of words
[1:33:51] <Blank9> best duo
[1:33:53] <HonterThompson> Drippin' Du Bois, they call him
[1:33:53] <ingman112> @torusendor He can't do anything with it yet, even if he passes the check. Stop telling him
[1:33:55] <%logoth_> My cans. My precious antique CANS
[1:33:59] <%logoth_> what have you done to em??
[1:34:05] <%VyperVic> @yourliteraldog they might start getting into trouble
[1:34:07] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[1:34:08] <+oda_flobunaga> if a stat is too high, you bass all passive checks and get pulled into some fucked up shit
[1:34:24] <%Mothman007> This man's voice is SO GOOD
[1:34:30] <yourliteraldog> cool
[1:34:32] <aiutare47> Hey that kinda sounds like another place

[1:39:28] <%torusendor> It's because it's so close to our world while also being completely alien
[1:39:36] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Futurecity10 The studio is working on publishing an English version.
[1:39:52] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I'm definitely buying it when it comes out.

[1:40:46] <%Xevtes> nvm
[1:40:49] <%Agami23> this game feels like a parody of real life that i dont think i've seen in any other game.

[2:22:44] <sirrice77> @NoHopeForMyCuirass yes he does and takes money because he feels he earned it
[2:22:45] <%extradopeness> People with big secrets are ALWAYS forthcoming
[2:22:45] <%mads_valentine> L  O  S  T   G  U  N
[2:22:47] <yeeyeyee> @NoHopeForMyCuirass that's a very major spoiler
[2:22:47] <%Deft_Thought> He's manipulative
[2:22:48] <+livingdynamo> @NoHopeForMyCuirass He does care, otherwise he'd sell the union out
[2:22:55] <%bevyrage> lost gun...
[2:22:55] <ingman112> Everybody take it easy. Chill. Remember what we know and don't know so far and let's not jump the gun
[2:22:55] <primaryfire> this is a strategy
[2:22:56] <+BaronBlackwood> You MUST speak to Joyce about the LOST GUN WITHOUT KIM
[2:23:02] <twohitgood> i've gotta think that if he's saying "tell her everything" then he's kayfabin everything.
[2:23:11] <%hax_metatron> DO THE CONTAINER IT's SO GOOD
[2:23:18] <Queqs_> Yeah talk to the container Pat. Reason with it
[2:23:19] <NeroInfinite> talk to container
[2:23:20] <%emperordread> Use CHARM on CONTAINER?
[2:23:25] <Zap_Rowsdower32> @NoHopeForMyCuirass I would answer that but it would be spoilers. I will say Evrart is a really nuanced character though.
[2:23:27] <%putnampuppeteer> The container takes a while to get to tho
[2:23:28] <+KingpinLarry> there's some good stuff in that container
[2:23:29] <+bugz_munny> Whether you like it or not
[2:23:34] <%dalmek> I love how Evrart emanates slime
[2:23:36] <+KilogramHours> Composure?
[2:23:37] <%sawgrass_> @hax_metatron If he passes trhe check without save scumming
[2:23:37] <%red_cuppa> composure? lmao
[2:23:38] <%dalmek> you can really tell
[2:23:40] <+JustToWatch> seduce the container Pat
[2:23:40] <%Maids4lyfe> I like his voice
[2:23:40] <%BigCoffee> inland!
[2:23:41] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> What if thats not Evert
[2:23:43] <%Deft_Thought> Did you even talk to him about the hanging? That man could fucking gab
[2:23:45] <+MisterAvry> that seemed like a bad man
[2:23:49] <+UnabashedGarbage> Go charm the fucking doors of that container Pat
[2:23:53] <yeeyeyee> Evrart and Joyce are both real 3D characters and that only comes to the front as the game progresses
[2:23:53] <LunarRemix> Nah put it Rhetoric
[2:23:55] <+JustToWatch> any more thought slots?
[2:23:55] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt You'll want to save scum the container. It is *amazing*
[2:23:56] <%Deft_Thought> Ohhhh
[2:23:57] <%putnampuppeteer> Nearly everyone in the game is nuanced with the exception of like maybe three people
[2:23:57] <ZE_Count> hes slime for the people
[2:23:58] <T_Sasquatch> verbal boss fights PogChamp
[2:24:03] <+KillerCrocomire> Evart is a slimeball physically
[2:24:04] <soflicar> up your rhetoric and go to the container
[2:24:07] <sirtommygunn> Save skill points for retrying white checks
[2:24:09] <ZE_Count> SAVE
[2:24:11] <ingman112> Don't save scum. You can always come back
[2:24:13] <penitentpendant> Sidequesting for a badguy
[2:24:14] <+illusiveSaint> shivers is world building, you need composure to CHILL
[2:24:15] <%Deft_Thought> Yeah, he and his brother are twins, right? I wonder if there's any way to tell which is which
[2:24:16] <naoi0> Kind of wish you could do a post-evart conversatio wtih kim
[2:24:16] <vilecrois> You need another bath after handlign Evart, worse than handling the corpse
[2:24:16] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> YESSSSS, Container TIME
[2:24:23] <+lostcolors> WHAT?
[2:24:23] <+marlborored5> WHAT

[2:24:40] <%putnampuppeteer> @PatStaresAt if you wait for another day or two it'll become easier
[2:24:41] <perfect_disaster> that guy is a very well written character
[2:24:41] <%emperordread> Bonuses on the left say you have rhteotic-1 clothes
[2:24:42] <%mads_valentine> TAKE OFF BUM HAT
[2:24:44] <sirtommygunn> You can retry it after juicing
[2:24:46] <%VyperVic> hat

[2:26:56] <%Daxalog> "actual"
[2:27:01] <DSD24> Actual Art Degree
[2:27:01] <%putnampuppeteer> Half hobo half cop half artist, all sex symbol
[2:27:06] <Estwilde> We must identify art criminals
[2:27:06] <Vaunno> ((ACTUAL ART DEGREE))
[2:27:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeeeeeah shit all over the CW
[2:27:12] <+tnomads> yeah art cop is great
[2:27:24] <+OneGorillionDollars> LUL
[2:27:35] <primaryfire> the description is amazing
[2:27:37] <+MisterAvry> I'm already hooked
[2:27:39] <%Monkeyweed21> read the blurb
[2:27:39] <T_Sasquatch> I genuinely think being a critque is the lowest form of job a person can have
[2:27:40] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[2:27:41] <Tisaric> it's so good
[2:27:42] <vonmaultke> LUL
[2:27:53] <Aydarkzero> GOTTEM
[2:27:54] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Read the blurb sir?

[2:28:08] <ZE_Count> talk to steps guy
[2:28:09] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What's the Art Cop blurb sir?
[2:28:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Nah man being a youtube cartoon critic is the lowest
[2:28:10] <%king_wragles> Sorry Streamer
[2:28:10] <%putnampuppeteer> Pat takes morale damage
[2:28:11] <%Daxalog> But your a personality not a critic
[2:28:12] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> Being a GOOD critic is a very high stratum, but that's not easy
[2:28:12] <%torusendor> Journalist is lower
[2:28:13] <%Xevtes> read the blurb
[2:28:14] <perfect_disaster> damn
[2:28:15] <%Monkeyweed21> You dont even qualify as a critic Pat
[2:28:26] <T_Sasquatch> that wasnt directed at you LUL @PatStaresAt
[2:28:27] <Talen99> HAHAHA
[2:28:27] <%sawgrass_> Don't worry Pat, you're an appreciator not a Critique
[2:28:31] <%walternatorz> only thing worse are letsplayers. they don't even have an opinion worth a damn
[2:28:39] <trickster721> Yeah, we should just watch things and not comment on them
[2:28:49] <+Odinhasnobooty> By "the plain" he means "the pale"
[2:28:52] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> OMG I just got hear, DID PAT FINALLY APOLOGIZE TO SASQUATCH???
[2:29:03] <yeeyeyee> @T_Sasquatch as a job it's pretty trashy, but a critical eye applied constructively to those who are learning is an important part of being a good teacher
[2:29:03] <+TheBigO75> Manana is pretty cool.
[2:29:11] <T_Sasquatch> I meant like people that say they are movie critics or music critics and get paid to critque LUL
[2:29:18] <yeeyeyee> the other important part is of course knowing how to create
[2:29:25] <ingman112> RACISM
[2:29:26] <+KilogramHours> What does 2 even mean?
[2:29:26] <%Ranryu692> racism
[2:29:26] <%dalmek> racism
[2:29:27] <ZE_Count> racisist?
[2:29:28] <penitentpendant> Good ole 4
[2:29:28] <+Odinhasnobooty> PAT NO THAT'S RACIST
[2:29:28] <Vaunno> hustlegrinder????
[2:29:29] <%putnampuppeteer> It means he's not white
[2:29:30] <LeotheHuntsman> racist
[2:29:30] <%king_wragles> It's the dork option
[2:29:31] <+JustToWatch> I think it's rascism
[2:29:32] <%Eilocke> it is racism
[2:29:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> racism
[2:29:32] <+Odinhasnobooty> THAT'S VERY RACIST
[2:29:33] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It's racism pat
[2:29:33] <+upandadam> racism
[2:29:34] <%mads_valentine> Racism
[2:29:35] <Queqs_> Harry doesn't even know what it means
[2:29:35] <+projectmanatees> racsim
[2:29:35] <$apolitenoob> Gotta stay on that Hustlegrind
[2:29:36] <RedPlasticCup> racism
[2:29:38] <%Ranryu692> it isn't a white weasel
[2:29:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> big racism
[2:29:38] <iosephe> White weasel
[2:29:38] <+RyanTheRecluse> racism
[2:29:40] <%torusendor> Racism
[2:29:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Racist
[2:29:41] <Aydarkzero> that's a racism alright
[2:29:43] <penitentpendant> 2 is 'NATIONALISM'
[2:29:44] <%king_wragles> Wait fuck, is it racist?
[2:29:45] <perfect_disaster> oh no
[2:29:47] <Deceptimus> Out -of-towner Weasel.
[2:29:49] <+upandadam> racists love cloaking their shit
[2:29:56] <rekinom> commie art cop
[2:29:56] <user_naim> Smells like racism
[2:30:02] <Vaunno> COMMUNISM YEAH
[2:30:03] <+Mrbaconator> YA COMMUNISM
[2:30:05] <+Odinhasnobooty> It's Inuit racism, I think (or the DE equivalent of Inuit people)
[2:30:07] <%extradopeness> man FUCK gary
[2:30:15] <ZE_Count> I mean not local is pretty obvious
[2:30:20] <%Deft_Thought> Manana is a cool dude
[2:30:49] <%mads_valentine> Manana is my favorite
[2:31:01] <penitentpendant> @ZE_Count problem is there's Nationalist AND Racist political options, and sometimes they overlap in overtures
[2:31:16] <vilecrois> I am the law.
[2:31:16] <+TheBigO75> I love when you have arguments inside your own head.
[2:31:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I am the  LAAAW
[2:31:26] <%sawgrass_> I like that Manana's grin does'nt affect his moustache

[2:38:41] <feralspidey> Speaking as an American, it's meant to represent the memory of all armed forces that gave their lives for our liberty. And YES, even with that context is it offensive how many US Flag Bikinis there are.

[2:42:45] <gecomaman> @blowfirethroattotem It’s mostly fine, i assume it’ll get better with more patches. Most of the problems are just finicky interface and a tiny tiny text size

[2:47:34] <%Garthunox> Talk to the racist lorryman instead, he has new dialogue i swear
[2:47:34] <penitentpendant> TBF, the lory quest is a little problematic because you have to talk to them multiple times until the task says 'complete'
[2:47:36] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt put us in emote jail pls

[2:53:24] <penitentpendant> It IS neat when people drop their accents in this game
[2:53:24] <+MisterAvry> of all the accents to fake, why that one?
[2:53:29] <CharredChord> Game very pretty
[2:53:31] <%Deft_Thought> The cars look cool in this game
[2:53:33] <sirtommygunn> zed
[2:53:34] <Lutre> there's a lot of lines in this game that make it seem as if Harry is attracted to men but in denial, hence why f- is the only censored slur in-game IIRC
[2:53:37] <%Ranryu692> @wizard_of_diamonds nice
[2:53:58] <+KilogramHours> The vehicle designs in this game are so interesting

[2:55:24] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Kim has like all his stats at like 10
[2:55:25] <%putnampuppeteer> Kim Kitsuragi is the ultimate sigma male
[2:55:30] <sirtommygunn> Kim looks like he's 50 pounds lighter than you and he popped that window easily
[2:55:36] <+MisterAvry> good thing you have Kim around
[2:55:37] <yourliteraldog> 1
[2:55:38] <ingman112> "We can't break this, so it must be shattterproof!"
[2:55:48] <Talen99> Kim is so high off his victory with the racist, he just muscles through bullet glass
[2:55:52] <pokefan9956> !uptime
[2:55:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 56m.
[2:56:10] <moonmeh> wtf is ambrette
[2:56:11] <%dalmek> bluhd
[2:56:12] <Ranryu692> IT'S BLUD
[2:56:23] <%hax_metatron> The Kim pose is amazing for your posture, really gets you feeling like you can take on the world when you fold your hands behind you and puff up your chest
[2:56:25] <perfect_disaster> hot
[2:56:29] <+MisterAvry> I know it's a different timeline, but "even the 90s" hurts a little
[2:56:31] <jorniev> ITS BLUUUUUUD
[2:56:42] <%putnampuppeteer> the skylight in the truck is kind of a nice touch
[2:56:51] <+Pyroclase> So do some of the skills share voice actors?
[2:57:19] <sirtommygunn> yeah
[2:57:20] <%putnampuppeteer> I think all of the skills with the exception of the occasional Shivers line have the same voice actor
[2:57:22] <perfect_disaster> thats big
[2:57:23] <Zap_Rowsdower32> All the skills have the same VA
[2:57:23] <naoi0> @Pyroclase I think they all do
[2:57:36] <+Pyroclase> oooh, that's a bit disappointing admittedly
[2:57:48] <trickster721> They took the audiobook approach
[2:57:51] <naoi0> Yeahh.
[2:58:00] <+Pyroclase> I thought Drama had a different voice in one of the trailers?
[2:58:04] <Profmcstevie> All the personalities inside your head sound the same, I don't mind that idea
[2:58:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> For extra friction
[2:58:12] <penitentpendant> Phoenix Wright Music INTENSIFIES
[2:58:12] <egoat> there
[2:58:13] <%Garthunox> @Pyroclase that'd be 20 VA's alone, Zaun are an indy studio
[2:58:17] <+projectmanatees> smooth sole
[2:58:20] <naoi0> Neat.
[2:58:23] <+Pyroclase> Yeah, good point.

[2:58:59] <+LucaSteal> OOOOOO
[2:59:05] <digaogrunge> Hard Ladyboy
[2:59:08] <%emperordread> Devil Woman
[2:59:23] <+KilogramHours> You dont need to look at the body
[2:59:23] <+Mrbaconator> they exist
[2:59:24] <ingman112> Apparently 4 hours
[2:59:28] <%hax_metatron> This is a FANTASTIC mystery for a video game
[2:59:28] <+KilogramHours> Basically nothing
[2:59:28] <kazadog> you can solve the mystery on like day 4
[2:59:30] <+projectmanatees> 40 mins
[2:59:32] <+Pyroclase> You'd need to pass time manually because of the bridge, though
[2:59:35] <+illusiveSaint> this was one of the last quests i completed
[2:59:38] <%hax_metatron> Really cool detective type shit
[2:59:40] <NeroInfinite> you can skip the body investigation
[2:59:42] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you don't need to look at the body even
[2:59:42] <Zap_Rowsdower32> You don't even have to investigate the body
[2:59:44] <Tisaric> oh there's dozens of these extra bits, it's amazing
[2:59:44] <penitentpendant> TBF, more of this is optional than you think.
[2:59:45] <%emperordread> There's an achievement for not even investiigating the body
[2:59:46] <%bread_assassin> You can complete the game without looking at the body. There's an achievement for doing it.
[2:59:51] <yeeyeyee> @kazadog takes at least 5
[2:59:52] <+OhioNitsud> i didnt do this in my run
[2:59:52] <%Garthunox> There's a trophy for completeing the game without looking at the body
[2:59:54] <+projectmanatees> docwalk holds the wr with 40 mins and 44 seconds
[2:59:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah I think I finished the game on like day 5
[2:59:57] <penitentpendant> There's an achievement for NEVER LOOKING AT THE BODY
[3:00:11] <jorniev> NEEEEERD
[3:00:12] <sirtommygunn> you haven't done much differently from me but you've gotten a ton of different evidence out of it
[3:00:14] <Zap_Rowsdower32> And I did it my second playthough
[3:00:15] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  one of the achievements is solving the mystery without looking at the body
[3:00:22] <ingman112> @perfect_disaster STFU
[3:00:24] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> there is a achievement for solving the case without looking at the body
[3:00:27] <%hax_metatron> MAP GET
[3:00:36] <%SirGO0SE> @Chatterbox1991 thats rad
[3:00:46] <perfect_disaster> @ingman112 why
[3:00:57] <ingman112> Don't spoil shit that could or might happen
[3:01:06] <user_naim> let’s not discuss anything we haven’t seen
[3:01:14] <ingman112> If it hasn't happened on screen yet, take woolie's advice and STFU
[3:01:30] <tanarath> ^
[3:01:40] <penitentpendant> Also, this game would be hell to speedrun since checks can ruin the run

[3:42:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Great rebuttle, considering the circumstances
[3:42:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, this game has lots and LOTS of "Maybe don't say that shit" options
[3:42:24] <%GarbageNirvana> What do you call russian roulette in this

[3:43:00] <+oda_flobunaga> Graddian Juggling probably
[3:43:01] <+frobotmk2> Klaasje and the merc were an interesting dynamic to me
[3:43:05] <%putnampuppeteer> @GarbageNirvana Honestly, probably Revachol Roulette. It's not quite a parallel, but it's close enough
[3:43:09] <%hax_metatron> This is a GREAT mystery
[3:43:10] <OverheadOctopuss> she just wanted 2 cover her ass you mean
[3:43:16] <$RealThiele> titus the rape man

[3:43:25] <LorcaNomad> titus' story is fucking nuked at this point
[3:43:26] <Parapattern> According to Woolie, love is just chemicals in your brain, so isn't drugs the most pure love of all?
[3:43:31] <sirtommygunn> also a thug of the company
[3:43:37] <naoi0> Snort.

[3:44:37] <$RealThiele> HMMMM
[3:44:47] <penitentpendant> ...that's some advanced tech on her part
[3:44:52] <+oda_flobunaga> Clever Girl...
[3:44:55] <LorcaNomad> Poor Garte
[3:44:55] <%dork_doggler> Damn that takes a bit of know-how
[3:45:06] <jorniev> this game is awesome
[3:45:10] <OverheadOctopuss> bullshit no idea what shez doin
[3:45:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> "You know these guys?"
[3:45:24] <penitentpendant> Absolutely correct!

[3:45:28] <faegbeard> based and orange-pilled
[3:45:29] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So hella based
[3:45:30] <Dr_Mooose> pretty based
[3:45:30] <aiutare47> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:45:31] <vilecrois> Henry's tottaly smitten
[3:45:33] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Just like Volition said.
[3:45:33] <%kyh9> Bebe is SO cool

[3:45:41] <%hax_metatron> This is a boss fight that fucks your stats
[3:45:43] <ZE_Count> SHE IS BASED
[3:45:47] <%kyh9> Reaction Speed is pretty stable, but Volition is the MVP here
[3:45:49] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> She is red pilled and based alright
[3:45:49] <balthazar758> base
[3:45:51] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Your skills are a part of you, any you DEFENITELY think she's based
[3:45:52] <%grub> @Daxalog definitely not cuno
[3:45:58] <%extradopeness> shes the fucking best
[3:45:59] <%putnampuppeteer> I mean, to be fair, she's fairly based
[3:46:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I thought she was pretty cool.
[3:46:02] <penitentpendant> @hax_metatron To quote star wars: BETRAYAL
[3:46:05] <Drewcromwell79> the video feed keeps repeating
[3:46:06] <%hax_metatron> What a performance!
[3:46:20] <ingman112> This is one where when we get to Woolie I really hope people clamp down on shit
[3:46:24] <reonome> im just thinking about her watching cuno throw rocks at him
[3:46:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They should make the next game about her doing based drifter shit
[3:46:34] <ingman112> It's one of the coolest things in the game and it'd be a shame to fuck it up for him
[3:46:36] <%extradopeness> narcissistic
[3:46:39] <%Ranryu692> this is making me want a cigarette lol
[3:46:41] <Wanderer_Demon> @aiutare47 more of a time investment issue. But I will for sure take a look at this later.
