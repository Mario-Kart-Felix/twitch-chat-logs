[0:11:59] <Vigonept> get to work clown funny man
[0:12:06] <iamnotaparrot> the blood and cum thing is real. the BTs are weak to "signs of life and connection." blood is family connection and sex is the ultimate connection.

[0:12:55] <gustavozxd> Sakurai said that back in smash 4 though...
[0:12:57] <%heyitsbrian> PAT hello.
[0:12:58] <+HyperCharge_Sam> they say that so you get surprised in 2044 when Goku gets in
[0:12:59] <%hntronium> The biggest

[0:13:20] <%superc37> So does no Halloween mean no saw?
[0:13:24] <ape_hawk> is this a new record?
[0:13:28] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat No sound
[0:13:29] <%Wrashis> muted
[0:13:31] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat we can't hear the game

[0:16:22] <iamnotaparrot> we do the forklift seagulls yet?
[0:16:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Ion_Laser I'm sorry, I'm not sure who you mean

[0:16:44] <%Calek> oh that's a thing I didn't find
[0:16:51] <%devanmuse> @VritraReiRei you mean "a puzzle that you can fall bass ackward into the solution of"
[0:16:57] <gustavozxd> @arancet every platform lmao that sucks
[0:17:22] <%Ion_Laser> @rumtumtugnutz The main character in this game is like Neo from The Matrix movies with the ability to fly and move objects with the mind
[0:17:22] <%nmaten> fang shwee
[0:17:28] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat so we're dealing with that one stand from part 6
[0:17:28] <%JJnAJjohnson> fung shway
[0:17:33] <%Tearonex> So these fucks just gamble all day?
[0:17:42] <%king_wragles> Yes
[0:17:42] <%42nfl19> all in is bad?
[0:17:43] <LeftOverPizza13> is this loss
[0:17:46] <+ArcaniteForce> Turn on the lights on the desk and try the roulette
[0:17:50] <%Jaxnos> Jaxnos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! let the puzzle flow through you, it will definitely work
[0:17:50] <VritraReiRei> @devanmuse eh, there's at least one thing you have to do purposely. can't exactly fall into the fish solution
[0:17:53] <+Clik404> @arancet I think all the excitement I had for that game got sucked out of me by everything surrounding it, not even a boycott, just a lack of interest at this point
[0:18:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Fang shoe-y?
[0:18:03] <%SummonerMagno> its not gambling, its surprise mechanics
[0:18:05] <+SolverCODO> Remember, luck fall out if upside down, duh
[0:18:08] <%ThirdPersonPhil> the person on top passes the psych test for having drawn a floor for his stick figure
[0:18:12] <%ElenaManetta> you fuckers need to donate more so i can stop missing the gameplay when i dont get home exactly at 8pm
[0:18:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Film Projector has a light in it.

[0:18:48] <+SolverCODO> People are lying to you pat
[0:18:52] <Ner234> Why Pat?

[0:19:07] <flatty1000> and then not stand in the room?
[0:19:07] <@commanderclaw> Honestly, you should look up the answer to this puzzle, it's fucked
[0:19:11] <gustavozxd> Jebaited
[0:19:18] <ActualNobody6400> You let all the light out now
[0:19:21] <+SolverCODO> It's totally solvable as presented
[0:19:22] <@lewdskeletor13> Claw wants you to do big cheats
[0:19:26] <Flunkorg> Yeah, this puzzle is fucked
[0:19:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I said that, lol. I was thinking it may be not obvious. I guess breaking lights is one way to eliminate working lights haha
[0:19:35] <@commanderclaw> Damn, straight I do, I hate this puzzle
[0:19:37] <+SolverCODO> you just have to trial and error it, turn a thing on and see how it affects the number
[0:19:40] <%blankwaffle> you walked right by a document in the last room on the desk if it matters
[0:19:45] <@lewdskeletor13> apatGib

[0:22:33] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The horse shoe's on an orange plaque outside the door. First cublicle to your left at the main turn.
[0:22:40] <@commanderclaw> Plant the clover
[0:22:45] <%Laecerelius> he planted it
[0:22:46] <IminyourBase> you should have been the one to fill that dark projector with liiiiiiiight
[0:22:47] <%king_wragles> @commanderclaw he got it
[0:22:52] <%hntronium> wasn't there something about a horseshoe
[0:22:56] <@commanderclaw> No, you have to plant the clover behind the CRT
[0:22:56] <%JJnAJjohnson> it took me a few tries with what i thought the solution would be, just keep going
[0:23:00] <flatty1000> don't you need the horseshoe in there too?
[0:23:08] <%hntronium> I think he planted the clover
[0:23:12] <+SolverCODO> luck go down
[0:23:13] <%Laecerelius> flip horseshoe so the luck flows out?
[0:23:15] <%king_wragles> @commanderclaw ya, he did that
[0:23:19] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you keep running by the horse shoe
[0:23:19] <+JustToWatch> check the board again, if it's a question mark it might be no
[0:23:23] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Don't stand on the rug.
[0:23:23] <dredshift> Pat, you need to step away after spinning
[0:23:27] <LeftOverPizza13> clovers make land more fertile for crops which is why it's considered lucky

[0:24:19] <%hntronium> check data again?
[0:24:24] <+SolverCODO> Fish only needs to be on red carpet

[0:34:50] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Is this Saints Row 5?
[0:34:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat These virtual plants in this virtual world get more attention and affection from this virtual character than I do irl. FeelsBadMan .gif
[0:35:01] <+SolverCODO> From the luck room puzzle
[0:35:03] <cureneckbeard> was it a shadow puzzle
[0:35:03] <shevan123> KING IN YELLOW
[0:35:08] <rosemon5001> that line was changed defenatly since another letsplay i watched said flaps instead @AngriestPat
[0:35:16] <VirtuaRailith> If he was really RPing as Paige, she'd be telling the plants about her fanfiction
[0:35:25] <%devanmuse> now that you have levitate, couldn't you float to the bottom of that pit in the other room?
[0:35:28] <%AnIrishPapaya> I'll have to check the VOD. Hopping into these control streams is rough

[0:39:18] <%Laecerelius> Pat fucked a skeleton so he got the Mustard Queen suit
[0:39:23] <Patzzki217> i should start talking to my succulents LUL
[0:39:25] <madskull456> If someone told me this was a fan made game for paige id believe it

[0:39:34] <%marsanta> Ground pound!
[0:39:36] <%rasterman> more energy
[0:39:37] <+zackalan> does the gold suit do anything special?
[0:39:38] <%Calek> more energy more launching
[0:39:38] <Patzzki217> more energy?
[0:39:40] <ape_hawk> levtate
[0:39:41] <VritraReiRei> Energy
[0:39:42] <Flunkorg> Shield barage kinda sucks
[0:39:42] <%hntronium> go for it

[0:39:45] <%Ascethetic> energy
[0:39:46] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat what are the options? Go over them so we can see the symboles?
[0:39:46] <Patzzki217> since energy is pretty low
[0:39:47] <+SolverCODO> shield barrage is nice
[0:39:49] <%Aeoneth> shield barrage
[0:39:50] <%JJnAJjohnson> slam
[0:39:51] <%mistymntns> Get your Energy up
[0:39:51] <%flyingavocad0s> Energy
[0:39:53] <%Aeoneth> ground pound is useless
[0:39:55] <%mistymntns> Just focus on that and helath
[0:39:57] <+SolverCODO> energy is really important tho ya
[0:40:06] <%NeroInfinite> Energy is good stuff
[0:40:07] <%Calek> weirdly enough the ground pound can be used as a flashlight
[0:40:11] <+JustToWatch> large enemies telekinesis is mediocre, but what come AFTER that is amazing
[0:40:17] <%flyingavocad0s> @aeoneth Only way to get to some areas
[0:40:25] <+SolverCODO> Large enemy seizure is WAY more valuable than throwing

[0:40:39] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat so is part of the inspiration the same book that inspired stalker? it's just a bunch of alien trash that made stuff odd
[0:40:52] <%Dementedpenguin> Ew
[0:40:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Mind telling us what the tiny blue light sources are on the ground? Are they health pips? I haven't been able to figure it out and missed the explanation, if there was one.
[0:40:56] <%Dr_Mooose> moldy bois
[0:40:57] <%JJnAJjohnson> gross
[0:40:57] <+SolverCODO> With large enemy seizure you can capture those orbs that will heal you AND other enemies you seize, extending the timer
[0:41:01] <%Calek> I had to look up a guide for this side quest, I found it weirdly difficult

[0:43:05] <Graxe_> The mold is explicitly told to you that it smells nice and makes you hungry
[0:43:07] <+ledgefiendd> the camera is in an interesting spot
[0:43:09] <%marsanta> Frame picture!
[0:43:12] <%JJnAJjohnson> @ledgefiendd shooter scp

[0:43:57] <JinzoWave> oh shit do I get to see crazy talk in action?
[0:44:01] <latgeek> AWE actually means Alan Wake Event
[0:44:06] <%hntronium> alan wake dlc fuck yea
[0:44:06] <iswearimjustdandy> @sammyovision he started at like 8:15

[0:44:24] <iswearimjustdandy> @sammyovision so you didnt miss much
[0:44:25] <Delenay> in the back?
[0:44:27] <@commanderclaw> The last cluster is bullshit

[0:44:40] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat check showers
[0:44:41] <Strider222> hello
[0:44:50] <%grayjammer> there was one in there
[0:44:51] <+Javaa01> One in a Shower, one in the door you cant go through in the office
[0:44:51] <+SolverCODO> when he screm = health low
[0:44:51] <ape_hawk> oh, then youre in bad health
[0:44:54] <Ominnous> Kind of short on health it looks like
[0:44:54] <%JJnAJjohnson> no very healthy
[0:44:56] <+Jimboq> pat is the picture of perfect health
[0:44:57] <%king_wragles> The smaller Pat gets, the less health the character has
[0:44:59] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat if you're the health icon does that mean it's low?
[0:44:59] <%marsanta> Health is low then
[0:45:04] <%Futurecity10> Anyone know why the view count is so low? Is it really because of borderlands?
[0:45:04] <latgeek> the mold blob glows, pat
[0:45:06] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s looking pretty unhealthy Kappa
[0:45:17] <%hntronium> one more?
[0:45:19] <krymzen5> such a short health bar Kappa
[0:45:24] <Patzzki217> the last one took me a while
[0:45:27] <+SolverCODO> Last one is a bitch. Through that first long room, through the gap in the door at the end @AngriestPat
[0:45:30] <Patzzki217> its pretty hidden
[0:45:34] <majindusto> There was a health meter here...It's Gone now
[0:45:34] <%42nfl19> i was away, what did pat get with the lucky puzzle?
[0:45:44] <Trash_leviathan> i just got here why are you yellow
[0:45:45] <%Calek> this last one I found right away, a completely obvious one that I overlooked made me look up a guide
[0:45:48] <%FirearmsInstructor> "Eradicate" the mold by dispersing it and making the spores airborne. Good logic, game. :P
[0:45:55] <%Ion_Laser> @42nfl19 he got this yellow suit
[0:45:59] <%ledgefiendd> ledgefiendd subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:46:01] <Cherokia666> These were a little tricky to find. always hidden in plain sight
[0:46:09] <%mayorrev> what's with the suit

[0:46:17] <%JJnAJjohnson> @FirearmsInstructor but shut up tho LUL

[0:48:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat One of the funniest things is just hearing a semi-muffled, but emphatic "FUCKER!" from a different floor when I'm making dinner in a different part of the house.
[0:48:17] <Marpolo13> lol
[0:48:18] <ape_hawk> you FORGOT about fridge duty?!

[0:50:48] <djFishmonger> A chair shaped like a hand
[0:50:51] <Marpolo13> @TheHeroAppears a chair for your hand
[0:50:53] <%Calek> @rasterman modern technology doesn't work in this buildling
[0:50:54] <$rytyoung> ohh that's a nice suit, never got that one
[0:50:55] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat they talk with Langston
[0:50:56] <latgeek> @rasterman the building doesn't like new tech
[0:50:56] <%Calek> the buildilng doesn't like it
[0:50:57] <%hntronium> new guns dont work
[0:51:01] <+SolverCODO> @TheHeroAppears it's less horrifying than you might imagine
[0:51:11] <Reanimator83> @vritrareirei yeah
[0:51:11] <%solidousstream> @theheroappears I assume it's a chair that looks like a hand
[0:51:13] <ape_hawk> now to launch forklifts and shit
[0:51:15] <%floralkami> @rasterman have you been around for the earlier parts?
[0:51:15] <iswearimjustdandy> @rasterman things that are too new dont work in the oldest house

[0:51:28] <TheHeroAppears> as long as it's not a chair made of hands
[0:51:29] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's like getitng the max arm upgrades in deus ex
[0:51:29] <$GoogleyGareth> Basically anything that has physics
[0:51:30] <+Javaa01> Now you can basically throw everything in the game
[0:51:30] <%InugamiTheHound> pat has big balls now

[0:51:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Forklift Driver Klaus
[0:51:37] <Reanimator83> Ok SeemsGood
[0:51:38] <$rytyoung> that's gonna be useful later
[0:51:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> How large are we *TALKIN*!? ;D
[0:51:40] <%yatags> yatags subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:51:42] <%worldbrand> forkliftlift
[0:51:42] <+JustToWatch> it does a LOT of damage
[0:51:46] <%NeroInfinite> We ain't magneato Yet
[0:51:47] <latgeek> I really don't like that upgrade. It fucks with my flow when I'm just trying to chuck stuff at guys.
[0:51:48] <Patzzki217> upgrade pierce or grip
[0:51:48] <ape_hawk> now you can carry all those sins on your back
[0:51:50] <rosemon5001> its usually best to max out launch stuff
[0:51:51] <latgeek> Wish it was a different button.
[0:51:55] <%devanmuse> they TRIIIIIIED to kill me with a FORKLIFT~~
[0:51:57] <+SolverCODO> grip imo
[0:52:03] <%grayjammer> choice’s
[0:52:03] <%JJnAJjohnson> grip for sure
[0:52:05] <%Razputin217> Pierce can be upgraded now?
[0:52:11] <snoozeaholic> if only you could throw a ROAD ROLLA DA
[0:52:11] <TheMorilo> grip is the shit
[0:52:16] <twistedj3ster> I beat te game with just grip so you're good
[0:52:16] <%Laecerelius> Yeah it can be upgraded now
[0:52:19] <ape_hawk> yeah, they patched pierce
[0:52:24] <ape_hawk> its a boss-killer now
[0:52:27] <%grayjammer> for some reason i never liked grip
[0:52:36] <$rytyoung> I mostly used grip and shatter
[0:52:38] <%floralkami> @razputin217 it could always have been upgraded, if the materials were present
[0:52:39] <Reanimator83> Grip and shatter
[0:52:40] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat level IV?
[0:52:41] <%solidousstream> Does it look like you can fully upgrade everything before the end of the game?
[0:52:42] <iswearimjustdandy> I wonder when he will get 「THE WORLD」
[0:52:51] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat not sure if you knew this but you can dismiss quests you no longer want to do. That way, you can cycle through them until you get the BEST rewards
[0:52:54] <%Razputin217> it was bugged before
[0:52:56] <Pepebotellaw> if it's intense, sometimes I have to get a grip while taking a shit
[0:53:01] <LeftOverPizza13> bang bang bang bang
[0:53:02] <+SolverCODO> Spin is really good with an accuracy, raw damage, and headshot bonus up
[0:53:06] <%AnIrishPapaya> was Destroy All Humans the game that had the sick ass telekinetic powers?
[0:53:22] <$rytyoung> @anirishpapaya yah
[0:53:32] <Trash_leviathan> @AnIrishPapaya yeaa
[0:53:38] <%ThatOneGameTester> ooh hey now my twitch chat is working
[0:53:43] <%devanmuse> Can someone explain the logic as to why the magic TV gave you FLYING powers? The other OOPS I've seen at least made some kind of sense as to the powers they gave you, but that one eludes me...
[0:53:44] <VritraReiRei> Get rid of ALL OF THEM until you get MAX RANK rewards
[0:53:57] <%BoboDaHobo> so I've missed like all of these control streams, what should I know?
[0:54:07] <%AnIrishPapaya> Cool, these powers remind me of that. Always max upgrade telekinesis
[0:54:18] <%solidousstream> @bobodahobo there is no god
[0:54:20] <%ThatOneGameTester> @BoboDaHobo Ever heard of SCP? That.
[0:54:30] <latgeek> <the service weapon/gun is good, go forth and dismiss/kill>
[0:54:37] <+SolverCODO> This is such a weirdly trivial system
[0:54:40] <VritraReiRei> @BoboDaHobo he can FLY now
[0:54:52] <djFishmonger> clocks!
[0:55:06] <VritraReiRei> The Safe PogChamp

[0:55:39] <+SolverCODO> yeah you dont see that in a lot of games
[0:55:39] <%ThatOneGameTester> Don't ya love effort?
[0:55:58] <Reanimator83> Did Pat do the redacted TV’s
[0:56:03] <$rytyoung> Anyone know how you get the yellow suit?
[0:56:05] <latgeek> holy shit the GLOWING HOLE in the concrete behind the guy!
[0:56:07] <%Scrub_Seeker> @Reanimator83 yes
[0:56:14] <Graxe_> Clocks

[0:58:39] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat you can find the altered items you collect in the panopticon
[0:58:48] <iswearimjustdandy> @guilkato got it from a puzzle

[1:01:21] <%Soul_Intern> MORTIS
[1:01:21] <Strider222> you are dead
[1:01:22] <GuilKato> its time to die?
[1:01:24] <@commanderclaw> This is a rough one, throw damage helps
[1:01:29] <majindusto> WTF WAS THAT?
[1:01:29] <%Razputin217> this one took me a while
[1:01:30] <Graxe_> Clocks hurt when an anchor spits them at you
[1:01:34] <%marsanta> I love that it's attacking clockwise
[1:01:39] <T_Sasquatch> Oh thats a cute suit
[1:01:52] <asddsa28> wach that agin
[1:01:53] <%BoboDaHobo> what's with all the mouth sounds from pat today?
[1:01:55] <asddsa28> o well
[1:01:59] <%floralkami> @solvercodo naw, I'm tryna die much later, thanks
[1:02:00] <%Soul_Intern> So what have I missed before the clock throwing anchor?
[1:02:00] <TheMorilo> I kinda like this dark souls ass boss run
[1:02:02] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat you can hit it from the side if you aim just right
[1:02:09] <iswearimjustdandy> We have all been conditioned to like mustard
[1:02:21] <%grayjammer> Bit of trial and errorinvolved, which makes the run back to the boss each time somewhat aggravating
[1:02:30] <%solidousstream> @angriestpat his best
[1:02:43] <T_Sasquatch> Boss runs suck in any game
[1:02:45] <%InugamiTheHound> did paige dress her up in the mustard suit??
[1:02:50] <transporterthesequel> that's right pat RE-ESTABLISH DOMINANCE
[1:02:51] <Graxe_> All he's got are rockets. He's doing his best
[1:02:54] <twistedj3ster> Wow, this looks a lot better when all the settings aren't all on low
[1:02:55] <%ThatOneGameTester> Ahh yet, the Pat-tented bullet to the back technique Kappa
[1:02:55] <%JJnAJjohnson> the other control point is closer
[1:02:55] <Reanimator83> The added enemies in this one was tough
[1:02:55] <+Invaderjaymz> well it's hard to do anything WHEN YOU CAN WARP THE DANG WORLD
[1:03:01] <%Razputin217> Pierce still can't be upgraded on console FeelsBadMan
[1:03:01] <majindusto> HE WAS DOING HIS BEST BibleThump
[1:03:01] <+allups> how do u ger tht suit
[1:03:05] <djFishmonger> What's everyone's favorite type of clock?
[1:03:19] <TheMorilo> This game has one awful boss run
[1:03:20] <cureneckbeard> clock and balls
[1:03:22] <%floralkami> @allups a mission reward
[1:03:24] <+Fynale> mine is a ridwatch
[1:03:26] <T_Sasquatch> @djfishmonger digital it's just simpler
[1:03:28] <%grayjammer> @allups when you get Clearance 5, return to Luck and Probability, and do a puzzle
[1:03:36] <%InugamiTheHound> @djFishmonger does a pocket watch count? I want one from FMA
[1:03:42] <twistedj3ster> Pat stop holding your clock on stream
[1:03:43] <firehawk_420> !uptime
[1:03:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 3m.
[1:03:44] <majindusto> It is A CLOCKMAKER
[1:03:48] <+Grayhammatter> but do you actually?
[1:03:55] <Basch71> clock Ozma Kappa
[1:04:01] <%marsanta> In a clockwise direction
[1:04:03] <Patzzki217> like a clock almost
[1:04:04] <djFishmonger> @InugamiTheHound You can find them pretty cheap at conventions!
[1:04:04] <+allups> thanks @Grayhammatter @floralkami
[1:04:09] <%marsanta> Almost like it has a clock theme
[1:04:11] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat here's a tip, the Anchor attacks..... CLOCKwise haHAA
[1:04:25] <+Grayhammatter> almost like it's rotating CLOCKwise
[1:04:26] <firehawk_420> This is a cool fight
[1:04:29] <majindusto> Holy Shit...it IS Ozma!!!
[1:04:40] <%psydaku> is this the final boss?
[1:04:40] <%ThatOneGameTester> It all *adds* up now Kappa
[1:04:54] <%Calek> @psydaku just a side quest
[1:04:57] <%mistymntns> @psydaku Nah.
[1:04:58] <firehawk_420> @psydaku no it’s optional
[1:05:04] <Marpolo13> i suppose it helps when you convert the suicdalist to your side lol
[1:05:32] <djFishmonger> I'm still shocked to see side bosses be a thing and also one of the better parts of the game?
[1:05:43] <gekizenbu> love them Shapes
[1:05:52] <+Zereaux> Why is pat fighting hunhow?
[1:05:53] <%psydaku> oh. looks like a final boss tbh
[1:05:54] <latgeek> The mirror sidequest is THE best part of the entire game imo
[1:06:10] <%Laecerelius> woof
[1:06:11] <TheMorilo> This boss is a really sexy shape
[1:06:11] <%Razputin217> MISS
[1:06:13] <djFishmonger> @psydaku you should've seen the Former boss, now THAT looks like the final boss
[1:06:15] <T_Sasquatch> I really don't know what I'm looking at
[1:06:16] <%Verd_254> was a rock not a clock
[1:06:22] <%JJnAJjohnson> @psydaku the sidequests are better than the final tbh
[1:06:23] <%InugamiTheHound> why doesn't pat use his shield power?
[1:06:25] <%Verd_254> doesn't matter i guess
[1:06:26] <latgeek> 1hp
[1:06:27] <%king_wragles> pixel
[1:06:30] <firehawk_420> Ouch
[1:06:32] <%Razputin217> MAGIC PIXEL
[1:06:50] <%ThatOneGameTester> pow right i nthe kisser
[1:06:52] <majindusto> It's TIME for you to Die!!!
[1:06:53] <Marpolo13> yum
[1:06:53] <firehawk_420> I love that there’s a magic pixel in this
[1:06:59] <ape_hawk> YA THINK, JESSE?
[1:07:01] <%Ion_Laser> Nice!
[1:07:04] <%NeroInfinite> Ah the actual anchor
[1:07:04] <+ThunderZebraKing> Looks like that boss....Ran outta time B)
[1:07:09] <%reonome> why is it not a clock
[1:07:09] <twistedj3ster> Time to unwind
[1:07:10] <cureneckbeard> Throwing clocks with a floppy disk, the basis of all combat
[1:07:11] <%king_wragles> ... why clocks?
[1:07:11] <%reonome> 0/10
[1:07:13] <Graxe_> Who knew that an anchor could control clocks
[1:07:17] <plzza_kun> she's may from guilty gear?
[1:07:21] <laserbeaming> Oh, it was a literal anchor
[1:07:24] <%HRDSalami654> Put's on sunglasses.
[1:07:30] <%HRDSalami654> YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHH
[1:07:37] <majindusto> OCELOT
[1:07:49] <+reluctant_monkey> put an anchor in your pocket?
[1:07:56] <@BigNaturalMan59> hello patrick
[1:07:58] <%Dr_Mooose> excuse me?
[1:08:00] <Marpolo13> ded
[1:08:00] <ape_hawk> so its a black hole generator?
[1:08:02] <TheHeroAppears> I hate loss of fingernails
[1:08:06] <Graxe_> So the thing about the anchor is the what it does in the boss fight is not what the anchor is supposed to do.
[1:08:07] <latgeek> vomiting, vertigo, loss of fingernails = scurvy?
[1:08:10] <%reonome> ow my nails
[1:08:13] <@commanderclaw> "Loss of fingernails" might be the worst sentence ever
[1:08:16] <%AnIrishPapaya> Loss of fingernails is disturbingly specific
[1:08:19] <%Calek> can't believe Pat hates his mods
[1:08:20] <%NeroInfinite> No it's a REALITY anchor
[1:08:20] <%Razputin217> crush them all
[1:08:26] <%mistymntns> @AngriestPat look up. when you cross that threshold.
[1:08:26] <%axellogic> I have a weird thing with this game where I dont retain anything that happens
[1:08:28] <%Laecerelius> gotta eat those bad mods for money to upgrade your guns
[1:08:37] <%cereal_box_conspiracy> Never "presume" I'm dead - keep looking until you find a corpse!
[1:08:38] <+ThunderZebraKing> @commanderclaw Well, you'd never get hang nails again
[1:08:40] <%Aeoneth> Yeah the mod system definitely isn't the best
[1:08:42] <%worldbrand> BigNaturalMan59 commanderclaw dont listen to pat you guys are alright
[1:09:03] <+SolverCODO> There ARE weapon mods that are straight damage ups
[1:09:15] <%worldbrand> it was a joke because you said bad mods
[1:09:18] <@BigNaturalMan59> i am the greatest of all time
[1:09:19] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat there's two chest you didn't get in therer
[1:09:19] <%Bad1uck> @latgeek Scurvy would also include symptoms of hemophilia too I think
[1:09:21] <@commanderclaw> "I'm drowning in Bad Mods"
[1:09:29] <ape_hawk> that really doesnt explain what it was doing with the clocks, though
[1:09:38] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat WOW, way to just dump on your mods live on stream
[1:09:42] <%arancet> mods tyhemselves are fine i think, its managing the inv that sucks ass
[1:09:45] <asddsa28> look at the vod agin
[1:09:45] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:09:46] <Strider222> MORTIS
[1:09:46] <Patzzki217> there's no option to sort them out too which is annoying

[1:09:54] <%king_wragles> It's what you get for being mean to Claw
[1:09:55] <latgeek> I like it, the system is very non-committal
[1:09:58] <%Bad1uck> welp
[1:10:00] <%BappoSama> And Hello Pat
[1:10:00] <+ThunderZebraKing> Nobody expects the spanish inquisition!

[1:10:33] <+sabertoothzombie> more energy
[1:10:37] <%mistymntns> ENERGY
[1:10:40] <%floralkami> @devanmuse he walked into a pit
[1:10:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gravity is truly the strongest OoP of all
[1:10:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> shit went shopping before it started Did I miss anything?
[1:10:52] <Sokumotanaka> @flyingavocad0s there's a motel in this game?
[1:11:10] <%NeroInfinite> ha
[1:11:10] <T_Sasquatch> Unironically , gravity defeats everything
[1:11:15] <latgeek> Dank growth.
[1:11:16] <%floralkami> @doc_ock_rokc one of the better side quests
[1:11:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @floralkami GOD DAMN IT
[1:11:32] <%Laecerelius> Pat did a luck puzzle that got him the might mustard suit and has just been doing sidequests
[1:11:32] <latgeek> "I know exactly where to go!"
[1:11:33] <iswearimjustdandy> @doc_ock_rokc and a side boss
[1:11:34] <+Grayhammatter> this looks exactly like paige
[1:11:35] <%Soul_Intern> NICE
[1:11:37] <%flyingavocad0s> @sokumotanaka The oceanview motel
[1:11:43] <%Bad1uck> @doc_ock_rokc luck puzzle and the anchor
[1:11:47] <Graxe_> I really like this quest line
[1:11:49] <mat2501> The last fly ability point is so cool
[1:11:51] <firehawk_420> Paige would wear that suit
[1:11:55] <%ThatOneGameTester> do they have the equivalent of of that scp that only moves when not observed in this game?
[1:12:05] <twistedj3ster> You can drop down, then just evade
[1:12:07] <LeftOverPizza13> BACK TO THE PIT
[1:12:10] <ape_hawk> the pit was such a terrible show
[1:12:15] <@commanderclaw> The Kids are Down with the Devil!
[1:12:18] <+Fynale> why does this elevator end at a bathroom
[1:12:20] <%Razputin217> MOLD
[1:12:22] <%floralkami> @doc_ock_rokc don't worry, you're in time for the even better-er side quest
[1:12:22] <+Jimboq> yes
[1:12:23] <%arancet> @AngriestPat i'm halfway through AC's post games cases and man a lot of these fights are really great, might want to stream some of them

[1:12:36] <%Soul_Intern> @valriot LUL
[1:12:38] <%grayjammer> It "is" on the map, just only really vaguely
[1:12:39] <%NeroInfinite> Is that...THE TYPE WRITER?
[1:12:39] <Reanimator83> Time for Pat to get fucked
[1:12:39] <firehawk_420> *fondly remembers Dankest Dungeon*
[1:12:49] <Marpolo13> cuz why not
[1:12:52] <+ThunderZebraKing> Man, scp containment breach looks a lot different from how I remember it
[1:12:56] <twistedj3ster> elevator back
[1:12:58] <T_Sasquatch> There's something very lonely about this game

[1:27:07] <ape_hawk> Alan Wake Expansion... AWE
[1:27:12] <%gespenst25> is it Alan Sleep?
[1:27:18] <Wizardism> Alan Wake? Really? What a time to be alive.
[1:27:21] <+Fynale> didn't giant bomb get denied a code cuz of "dubious E3 coverage"?
[1:27:24] <Zebroneath> That selective review shit was kinda slimy
[1:27:25] <Strider222> look at all this MOLD
[1:27:26] <%Soul_Intern> @gespenst25 Alan Comma
[1:27:27] <latgeek> Alan Get Tucked In Bed

[1:27:58] <Daxalog> Can you convert the snipers?

[1:28:03] <latgeek> use the popcorn, patrick
[1:28:08] <+Fynale> i'm not suprised 2k games did just release literal gambling and tried to say it wasn't gambling and put unskippable ads into it's loading screens
[1:28:16] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Slimer isn't even as slimy as 2K and Gearbox right now
[1:28:16] <jackgrimsly> i got banned from the release stream for asking about Randy exposing himself to some kids.
[1:28:21] <%InugamiTheHound> Randy is a pedo right?
[1:28:22] <Marpolo13> how hard is that?
[1:28:26] <RupanSen> that's hard tho
[1:28:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> But crimes are fun.
[1:28:31] <transporterthesequel> To be fair, not commiting crimes as a CEO is HARD
[1:28:33] <seniormeatbox> @AngriestPat Do you think we'll ever get another Brothers in Arms game
[1:28:33] <chicken_danger> you don't understand, bribery and nepotism saves you 10% on production costs
[1:28:34] <Onmi_Khaos> Commit all the crimes and never stop being a hunka shit
[1:28:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat and not ruin a youtuber's career
[1:28:36] <Onmi_Khaos> Got it
[1:28:39] <jackgrimsly> Yeah, came up in his court case.
[1:28:41] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat All they had to do was lock Randy in a closet until launch
[1:28:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Well, his crimes weren't the fun kind.
[1:28:44] <%derekwst3> but ceo doing crimes is them showing they have balls.
[1:28:52] <Zebroneath> Have your CEO not commit crimes AND your publisher CEO not send two goons to someone's house.
[1:28:53] <jackgrimsly> Guess we know why he wants to be a magician huh?
[1:28:53] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it was 2k doing that ya know the guys who made NBA 2k
[1:28:54] <CaptainFrankincense> I dont know if randy can stop himself from having sex with children pat
[1:29:04] <%Soul_Intern> SPEEN
[1:29:07] <Reanimator83> Now that’s just crazy talk Pat LUL
[1:29:07] <seniormeatbox> Randy has fallen so far from 1997
[1:29:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> @derekwst3 Randy doesn't have balls just magic kits
[1:29:22] <chicken_danger> Not having a criminal CEO discourages investors
[1:29:23] <jackgrimsly> Make some little boys buts magicly get looser.
[1:29:25] <Onmi_Khaos> No no he only watches barely legal theme'd porn because girls squirting is akin to fucking magic
[1:29:30] <%InugamiTheHound> nba 2k20 is so broken

[1:30:15] <%reonome> too many games coming out anyway
[1:30:18] <Onmi_Khaos> I know you got like super internet, but seriously the DRM is brutal
[1:30:19] <%Slaardacity> isn't selling well tho?
[1:30:29] <%TenderBabyBacon> @arancet I've always played it solo and had a good time. But that could just be me
[1:30:30] <CaptainFrankincense> you to can fund little boys going to randy's peacock theatre
[1:30:33] <%stovetopism> theres so much better shit coming out anyway
[1:30:34] <RupanSen> tbf seems kinda pointless to play Borderlands singleplayer anyways
[1:30:38] <seniormeatbox> @Slaardacity fuckin Madden and NB2K sells well
[1:30:38] <%Soul_Intern> @Slaardacity Which is a fucking tragedy
[1:30:39] <%stovetopism> like shenmue 3 Kappa
[1:30:40] <chicken_danger> Borderlands 3 will be great after the DLC, it's already good. Better than 2.

[1:31:23] <%NeroInfinite> Far too many games comming out it's insane
[1:31:24] <%axellogic> But what if you LOVE Code Vein
[1:31:24] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat do you have thoughts on the rooster teeth lay offs?
[1:31:27] <%Anime_Flux> Is Remnant over or will you pick that back up someday?
[1:31:28] <%Piemen99> Shadowkeep?
[1:31:31] <Zebroneath> Pat updated the schedule down below.
[1:31:34] <reiju_22> i played the first network test and it felt like shit but apparently it got better?
[1:31:35] <%Razputin217> back to Remnant?
[1:31:36] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat, did you see the Crawfish summon in Yakuza 7?
[1:31:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ape_hawk sounds like my friend who was hyped for anthem and then the beta happened and he was so defeated
[1:31:40] <%arancet> i want code vein to be good.... its not sounding good
[1:31:42] <%Mitalis> You plan on completing FF7?
[1:31:43] <%InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat what if code vein is actually good? Would you play more of it?
[1:31:45] <DracaenaLeaf> I played the demo and actually enjoyed compared to when I watched people play the beta
[1:31:47] <%floralkami> @doc_ock_rokc ....... fuck, i just noticed that.
[1:31:52] <Sokumotanaka> the he's code vein and blasphemous?
[1:31:53] <CaptainFrankincense> oh and deamon X machina
[1:32:01] <+Javaa01> @angriestpat document on the box next to the control point you missed
[1:32:04] <Jontman42> There's too many good games this year let alone games in general
[1:32:06] <%MagickBurritoh> Daemon X Machina came out today
[1:32:07] <%joylent_blue> TONSO
[1:32:08] <seniormeatbox> @arancet It may turn out that Vampyr would be a better Vampire Dark Souls than the literal Vampire Dark Souls
[1:32:09] <%Anime_Flux> fair enough
[1:32:09] <fid0n> Did Pat do the fridge mission yet?
[1:32:11] <+Grayhammatter> tonzo
[1:32:15] <chicken_danger> PAT YOU JUST NEED TO STOP SLEEPING STREAM THEM ALL
[1:32:15] <+Fynale> tonezo to be donezo
[1:32:20] <%grayjammer> tunzo main

[1:32:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> The Barrel is Over flowing
[1:32:21] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat well hurry up and finish games faster
[1:32:22] <%stovetopism> I'm looking forward to code vein cuz I'm not made of fuckin paper for the first souls type game in awhile
[1:32:22] <Jontman42> Tonzo gaemz
[1:32:23] <%Soul_Intern> @fid0n Yeah he killed the fridge god

[1:32:23] <%Emperor_Machinus> But Daemon x machina
[1:32:23] <%psydaku> what about Daemon X Machina
[1:32:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Tonso games needs to be a game company
[1:32:26] <%alexandrecau> tonzo hattori
[1:32:34] <firehawk_420> @angriestpat have you been playing Iceborne off stream? Some of those new monsters are FOR REAL
[1:32:35] <Delenay> wasnt made with levitate in mind
[1:32:38] <%NeroInfinite> If you want to see more of the games pat covers but doesn't do full LPs of you can always buy the game yourself if you're into it
[1:32:44] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat Has the new Yakuza 7 stuff changed your opinions on it?
[1:32:44] <Ner234> @Fynale You stole my joke. I was gonna say that.
[1:32:46] <seniormeatbox> Why is the player character covered in mustard
[1:32:48] <Sokumotanaka> yeah pat's still gotta do ff7 and that takes alot of time on t's own
[1:32:49] <chicken_danger> JUST ORDER SOME PALATTES OF RED BULL IT'S FINE
[1:32:56] <foxhounder29> pat speedrunning is the future
[1:33:08] <%Laecerelius> Seeing the actual gameplay of Yakuza 7 has made me super hype for it
[1:33:13] <SomersaultJustice> patrunning
[1:33:20] <Marpolo13> big hidden
[1:33:20] <VritraReiRei> Ground floor, right entrance, there is a sign for "restrooms." Go that way for the toilet one and further down for the TV one
[1:33:23] <seniormeatbox> Oh yeah FF7 remake is PS4 only for some reason
[1:33:30] <Onmi_Khaos> No it isn't?
[1:33:35] <Onmi_Khaos> It's on the One?
[1:33:40] <%stovetopism> The final fight of Iceborne took we way more attempts than it should have, cuz of my refusal to rely on the crutch claw
[1:33:40] <seniormeatbox> Nope
[1:33:45] <seniormeatbox> PS4 only
[1:33:48] <%Soul_Intern> apatBig Lost
[1:33:50] <seniormeatbox> Don't know why
[1:33:53] <%Slaardacity> did pat finish all those red bulls?
[1:33:57] <latgeek> not being able to find a toilet? it's like a nightmare
[1:33:57] <Onmi_Khaos> No pretty sure they said it was multi-plat are you sure?
[1:34:08] <laserbeaming> They might port it later
[1:34:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> So I got a job today...amazon but still a job. Should I get a game to celiebrate/spend my last week off or should I make a children's book
[1:34:09] <%Soul_Intern> BASKET
[1:34:11] <RupanSen> I'm sure it'll come out on other platforms later on
[1:34:15] <laserbeaming> But for now PS4 only
[1:34:17] <firehawk_420> I’m stuck on sabertooth boi
[1:34:18] <%Razputin217> Pick a Nick Basket
[1:34:18] <Onmi_Khaos> Huh
[1:34:19] <+Javaa01> FF7R is multiplat, but it might have a launch exclusivity period on the PS4
[1:34:19] <Sokumotanaka> @seniormeatbox cause the original was only a playstation exclusive...
[1:34:22] <firehawk_420> He just murders me
[1:34:25] <%psydaku> no one EVER said it was multiplat
[1:34:25] <SlimeSlimeSlime> SCP?
[1:34:28] <leothewhitelion> Yes. Cocaine and Pat. My favourite combo.
[1:34:28] <Onmi_Khaos> Sure as fuck I coulda sworn it was announced as Multi-Plat

[1:35:01] <seniormeatbox> is multiplat
[1:35:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> @NeroInfinite this is a big false
[1:35:05] <chicken_danger> They'll do a FF7 remake PC release when sales die, which will be forever because it's episodic. Expect a FF7R on PC in 2021
[1:35:06] <%stovetopism> I honestly wanna wait for the full game to come out before playing FF7Remake
[1:35:07] <%falineth> falineth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months!

[1:37:12] <chicken_danger> Why is this anime protagonist dressed like Hillary Clinton?
[1:37:13] <shotgang86> I have just arrived, this is the first time I'm looking at this game and I though that white dot was a dead pixel in my monitor
[1:37:17] <seniormeatbox> why is the director wearing mustard
[1:37:19] <%Laecerelius> well there was that one threshold kids about a magic tv...
[1:37:20] <%TimetodiveLTX> imagine if your department head could fucking fly
[1:37:29] <firehawk_420> Dylan grew up in a glass cube watching that shit and being questioned constantly. No wonder he’s fucked up.
[1:37:31] <@BigNaturalMan59> patrick what is this game
[1:37:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is it a saucy puppet show?
[1:37:34] <shotgang86> I just freaked out for a good 20 seconds

[1:38:23] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat outer wilds?

[1:38:28] <%arancet> @AngriestPat how interested are you in the jedi game? people seemed dismissive at e3 but i think it has good potential
[1:38:29] <DracaenaLeaf> That gives us the excuse to purchase the games ourselves if we want to see the endings
[1:38:31] <Sokumotanaka> Got alot on your plate
[1:38:35] <%NeroInfinite> I'll be honest I'd probably just buy indvisble on myown and play just to support Lab Zero folks
[1:38:38] <T_Sasquatch> I've literally stopped buying games by the end of thus year
[1:39:03] <Marpolo13> no they were fucked

[1:39:35] <%miguelrod777> shes fun
[1:39:37] <mat2501> Metroidvania!
[1:39:38] <Marpolo13> BIG SHOOT
[1:39:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Valaria suit gained

[1:39:40] <%arancet> good news! its a suppository!
[1:39:42] <firehawk_420> Odd that she doesn’t mention all the dead rangers she did find
[1:39:42] <+fromnibelheim> microdosing
[1:39:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Greedfall looks alright, but I reckon that wouldn;t be a very good stream game.

[1:40:08] <%reonome> be a dog
[1:40:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> that would be nice, lady
[1:40:10] <%floralkami> I at least have to give her that, she didn't refer to them as subjects or some objects, she knows they were people @angriestpat

[1:40:28] <cureneckbeard> smelmo
[1:40:29] <%Nope80808> Melee Fans rejoce finally a pill for you!
[1:40:29] <%Slaardacity> does Jesse have any cute outfits in this?
[1:40:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> I remember this pit
[1:40:32] <%ThatOneGameTester> so now you will want to vomit instead of scarf down all the mold
[1:40:32] <latgeek> also THRESHOLD KIDS
[1:40:34] <%Virokwet> will it always smell now
[1:40:37] <@lewdskeletor13> The pill is made out of Emlo
[1:40:41] <%Dementedpenguin> Pitfall has changed over the years....
[1:40:47] <Marpolo13> wait.... does this mean you can EAT the mold and NOT get fucked up? PogChamp ?
[1:40:49] <iswearimjustdandy> Only 90s kids remember threshold kids
[1:40:51] <+soulcyber> So I've heard aboot this game being SCP basically but is it scary like SCP at all or just the science fictiony stuff?
[1:40:53] <ammobasket> meat bad broccoli good
[1:40:54] <areallygoodname> puppet time crikPog
[1:40:56] <latgeek> @flyingavocad0s yeah but it'd refresh so he respawns there instead of in Central Research
[1:40:57] <%NeroInfinite> if only we had a flas light
[1:40:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Due to the way that everything *** would make sense that she just gave her a placibo that caused an issue

[1:49:11] <%floralkami> damn
[1:49:12] <Marpolo13> well you tried. time to call it quits
[1:49:14] <Patzzki217> just lame it out behind the big pillar

[1:49:16] <Marpolo13> Keepo
[1:49:18] <%Boscuito> checkpointing continues to suck
[1:49:18] <%Soul_Intern> THAT SUCKS
[1:49:19] <latgeek> please WHAT
[1:49:21] <Meta_Four> Just tuning in. What did I miss since the last episode?
[1:49:21] <%Bad1uck> maybe you can shoot it's projectiles for hp
[1:49:22] <Jontman42> Back into the mold hole
[1:49:26] <Arts_Shadow2> What I miss?
[1:49:32] <Ner234> Speedrun time
[1:49:35] <%grayjammer> I'd give some solid advice that I think would work pretty well, but also I only managed to beat it when it bugged out and didn't attack me
[1:49:36] <%Laecerelius> Dark Souls it back to the boss!
[1:49:37] <%floralkami> i dont recommend laming it out behind a big pillar
[1:49:42] <VritraReiRei> Yeah... it's unfortunately like Dark Souls. You respawn at your "bonfire"
[1:49:53] <iswearimjustdandy> @arts_shadow2 mold, British professors and broken vhs tapes
[1:50:00] <shotgang86> N O P E
[1:50:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> shoot arm
[1:50:12] <%SammyOVision> Remember your shield.
[1:50:19] <Reanimator83> I will say this about this game. The checkpoints are fucking awful
[1:50:22] <%Dementedpenguin> o_O
[1:50:23] <krymzen5> jeez
[1:50:24] <Arts_Shadow2> BibleThump BibleThump

[1:50:34] <%dalmek> I think if you dodged while in the air
[1:50:35] <%Laecerelius> Yeah it really does look like a Zelda boss
[1:50:35] <%alexandrecau> you tried
[1:50:35] <%Ghost__Pantsu> Exploded lobosLULN
[1:50:36] <%Soul_Intern> Its gonna take a while
[1:50:36] <+SolverCODO> Low health, BIG damage
[1:50:37] <asddsa28> might want a sheld
[1:50:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> Oh hey when did they remake Battlekid
[1:50:40] <%dalmek> you might be able to survive?
[1:50:40] <latgeek> he's got BIG tracking
[1:50:44] <%Monkeyweed21> raise your shield
[1:50:44] <%grayjammer> It does driop health, just unfortunately close to the poison aoe
[1:50:46] <%Zalthia> Would shield help you?
[1:50:57] <iswearimjustdandy> Remember, never ever use shield
[1:50:59] <chaos2frozen> The checkpoint is Dark Souls style, and everyone loves Dark Souls
[1:51:01] <Meta_Four> Snazzy new outfit.
[1:51:15] <latgeek> what worked for me was just chucking a lot of the popcorn from the ceiling, and swapping out of any "health recovery" items for launch boosts
[1:51:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> How dare you kill your pretty little mold source who is just trying to give you food
[1:51:27] <transporterthesequel> Shield is for COWARDS and LOSERS
[1:51:28] <%alexandrecau> control is the dark souls of video game
[1:51:34] <GuilKato> use explosive fungus from room launched at mould?
[1:51:39] <majindusto> NOPE
[1:51:47] <Marpolo13> just win
[1:51:54] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat morning/evening dude. I tune in and the first thing I see is you throwing yourself into a pit LUL
[1:52:08] <%Captainahab_37> is the game GOOD
[1:52:09] <%worldbrand> this game is much more videogames than i expected it to be
[1:52:16] <chaos2frozen> shoot the glowing green ponts when its NOT covered
[1:52:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight just like bloodborne and darksouls
[1:52:17] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat the explosive mold on the ceiling does more damage btw
[1:52:22] <iswearimjustdandy> The PiT oF DeSpAiR
[1:52:24] <+SolverCODO> Pat just shoot the big center one...
[1:52:28] <Delenay> drop things on it?
[1:52:32] <twistedj3ster> I just focused on the face
[1:52:41] <latgeek> OH
[1:52:42] <%RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc lol EXACTLY
[1:52:49] <Marpolo13> mold vs gun
[1:52:52] <%Razputin217> I DIDNT KNOW THAT
[1:53:06] <%alexandrecau> bomb beat gun any day of the week
[1:53:18] <Arts_Shadow2> She can just fly?
[1:53:29] <Marpolo13> dayum
[1:53:33] <%Laecerelius> Pat got an item that lets him levitate
[1:53:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Arts_Shadow2 for a short period of time
[1:53:34] <majindusto> SNIPED
[1:53:35] <%Aeoneth> Gotta dodge those lunges brah
[1:53:41] <%NeroInfinite> upside at least know what to do
[1:53:48] <%TimetodiveLTX> i'm just gonna type out 'dash vectoring' for the 10 or so people in the chat that might actually know what i'm talking about
[1:53:50] <+krye> I had a lot of trouble with this fight. I saw a comment on a youtube video that said, "I beat everything in the game except this boss"
[1:53:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Shoot the middle one when he is shooting and the other two when they are punching
[1:53:54] <%blastazoid26> Hoes mad
[1:54:11] <VritraReiRei> @Arts_Shadow2 technically it's levitate because she can't really gain much more height than jumping twice
[1:54:17] <latgeek> lunging works, also you can toss stuff before it's floating next to your hand, remember that
[1:54:25] <%starkandstag> spbPLACEHOLDEREMOTE
[1:54:27] <%alexandrecau> how can you beat everything except this not final boss?
[1:54:59] <%Razputin217> Face tank the Mold 4Head
[1:55:14] <asddsa28> you might need more engry to do this
[1:55:15] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so if I manage to find any more specific information on that bug, or manage to trigger it myself since it's shared across platforms, I'll let you know immediately. Just keep a DM line open to me so I can do that. I know I was kinda vague earlier but sadly that's due to lack of info + being half asleep at the time.
[1:55:16] <Arts_Shadow2> ouch
[1:55:24] <@commanderclaw> There *are* health elements in the hurty fog
[1:55:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> No healer use other means other then pulling agro
[1:55:25] <+Squdnate> Use your shild when it projectile spams
[1:55:25] <Reanimator83> Face fuck that mold Pat
[1:55:42] <+Squdnate> and just shoot it when youre low on health, it drops blue stuff
[1:55:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Time to eat mold
[1:55:48] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat if you kill one of the arms it drops HEALTH
[1:55:50] <%Razputin217> the side quest bosses are pretty damn tough
[1:55:53] <%alexandrecau> mikiri counter pat
[1:55:57] <+TaylOctopus91> Don't feel bad Pat, it's a Dark Souls boss for sure.
[1:55:58] <+Javaa01> Listen to the audio cues
[1:56:00] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat you can easily kill it by putting auto bind on only one legion
[1:56:04] <iswearimjustdandy> I was just joking about not using shield
[1:56:07] <ape_hawk> Is that the source? It's... kinda pretty.
[1:56:08] <8_Bit_Badger> Pat when did you turn yellow
[1:56:16] <Shwepie> This looks like the inside of my walls.
[1:56:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> pillars are frineds

[1:58:19] <%Mitalis> Pat when you're making your way to the boss, you don't have to go out of your way to kill the moss guys, you can run straight to the boss, they won't follow you down to the boss room.
[1:58:33] <cureneckbeard> a bunch did
[1:58:34] <+SolverCODO> Raw damage is really good, you can get up to 100% increase. I got 98% anyway
[1:58:35] <latgeek> @Mitalis they just did tho
[1:58:39] <wholewheat420> @mitalis a bunch of them DID
[1:58:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Mitalis we just had a few that did
[1:58:45] <cureneckbeard> crazy talk activate.
[1:59:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat this room is the only one that matters
[1:59:10] <%Mitalis> oh I must've missed that... I did this boss yesterday, and I never got ambushed
[1:59:14] <%RubberFistFight> @Mitalis yeah like 3 dudes wound up in there with him and gave him a bad time.
[1:59:16] <chaos2frozen> I was told the boss would spawn adds, never let it live long enough though
[1:59:37] <%Monkeyweed21> You have to dodge
[1:59:38] <ape_hawk> he always eats that first smack
[1:59:40] <latgeek> wow it's almost like mold-1 starts with that attack EVERY TIME
[1:59:53] <Arts_Shadow2> I'm thinking about growing some clam mushrooms with a kit.
[2:00:01] <SixthSun2> OOF
[2:00:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> oaky
[2:00:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Stop taking hits
[2:00:08] <%Aeoneth> 2 punches and a headbutt
[2:00:10] <Delenay> fuck you i guess
[2:00:11] <%Monkeyweed21> DODGE
[2:00:13] <%Soul_Intern> This is going to take a while, isnt it?
[2:00:17] <latgeek> just stop getting hit 4Head
[2:00:20] <%Soul_Intern> Yep, it is
[2:00:22] <Patzzki217> pat hasnt even hit phase 3 yet
[2:00:22] <%flyingavocad0s> DODGE
[2:00:23] <Marpolo13> heart of the card pat
[2:00:24] <%marsanta> You MAY be underleveled
[2:00:25] <%Soul_Intern> You can do it
[2:00:26] <GuilKato> the shield is trying its best pat
[2:00:27] <latgeek> dodge > shield
[2:00:27] <%Mr_Strut> DOOOOOODGE
[2:00:27] <%RubberFistFight> just fucken picked outta the air
[2:00:30] <%Teyaric> timing. there is some gud to git
[2:00:31] <mat2501> it drops health on hit
[2:00:32] <%Soul_Intern> We believe in you Pat
[2:00:32] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> No pat DON'T get hit. I thought that was clear
[2:00:32] <Asuxley> that's a lot of red hue
[2:00:40] <+Javaa01> It punishes you for HOLDING the shield, drop it when you don't need it
[2:00:41] <Mister_McDerp> just stand there and take the hit
[2:00:42] <+Jimboq> this fight is a bitch
[2:00:50] <%dalmek> you've specced too heavily into Anti-Hiss
[2:00:50] <+Grayhammatter> might wanna drop your shield then
[2:00:54] <%SoleilAstier> Can somone tell me if its the stream or is the frame rate in this game all over the place?
[2:01:01] <Reanimator83> Tip for all Bosses: Never Stop Moving
[2:01:01] <+TaylOctopus91> Shield only helps with projectile spores sadly
[2:01:08] <Delenay> bring friends down?
[2:01:11] <+rowegd> Probably hardest fight in the game. At least it was for me.
[2:01:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SoleilAstier its the one complaint the game has
[2:01:24] <SixthSun2> Nice, friendly mobs for the bossfight
[2:01:25] <%grayjammer> Is that the SuuS?
[2:01:33] <ape_hawk> he dodged!
[2:01:35] <chaos2frozen> I stack headshot damage and it melted this boss
[2:01:35] <%SoleilAstier> @doc_ock_rokc thank you
[2:01:40] <%Bad1uck> @soleilastier framerate on this game sucks
[2:01:48] <Delenay> do mind slaves
[2:01:50] <Delenay> go
[2:01:50] <%Razputin217> the Tomassi fight was apatBig PJSalt for me
[2:01:56] <chaos2frozen> Too far, the launch lockon isn't working
[2:01:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Now you got it
[2:01:58] <latgeek> hey your friends are there!
[2:02:04] <latgeek> he's helping!!
[2:02:10] <+TaylOctopus91> @soleilastier the framerate does go all over the place at times. But dev's have said they're working on improvements in upcoming updates
[2:02:11] <Delenay> you can do it
[2:02:19] <%TimetodiveLTX> go moldmen go

[2:02:49] <+SolverCODO> @angriestpat those platforms can block the boss' strikes
[2:02:50] <Asuxley> it reminds me of lephantis, kinda

[2:02:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> HE was doing work!
[2:03:11] <asddsa28> so close

[2:03:19] <%dalmek> much better though, considering
[2:03:21] <TakesGuts> lmao

[2:03:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Walk it off and get back in there.
[2:03:24] <cureneckbeard> can you not wait and recover hp
[2:03:24] <%Monkeyweed21> gotta dodge better
[2:03:24] <%Ion_Laser> that was close

[2:03:25] <Patzzki217> the floor is now poison

[2:03:29] <%d00msdaydan> EMILY, WE NEED THE HAMMER
[2:03:30] <+JustToWatch> you really need to use your telekinesis more than your gun for bosses

[2:03:50] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat honestly, the guns aren't really helpful for these kinds of bosses. I did it with just LAUNCH
[2:03:50] <%Boscuito> there was an attempt

[2:03:57] <ScreamLord> So I left the stream for a few minutes and now I see Pat fighting a Necromorph
[2:03:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> That awkward moment you know someone that worked on Gears 5 and want to support him but no longer like gears of war anymore
[2:03:58] <%grayjammer> apatBig tilted

[2:04:22] <Reanimator83> This is Pats decline into madness
[2:04:33] <%flyingavocad0s> @doc_ock_rokc Gears 5 is good tho
[2:04:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> sorry to distract you
[2:04:36] <%NeroInfinite> Killed by goobers
[2:04:37] <%Ion_Laser> welp
[2:04:42] <krymzen5> its all falling apart
[2:04:43] <ape_hawk> its true
[2:04:43] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> true
[2:04:46] <%d00msdaydan> oh so it's like advanced warfare
[2:04:47] <%AnIrishPapaya> That's what happens
[2:04:54] <%Dr_Mooose> I stopped caring after 3
[2:04:55] <%Dementedpenguin> I gave up after Gears 2. Just wasn't into it.
[2:04:58] <%42nfl19> at least 5 is on steam right?
[2:05:00] <ape_hawk> just read the wiki for the summary of the plot of gears 4
[2:05:01] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat Sun down?
[2:05:03] <EliteShadowMan> Gears 4 was fine
[2:05:04] <Mister_McDerp> I stopped caring after Gears 3
[2:05:09] <RupanSen> @AngriestPat Can we dance if we want to?
[2:05:13] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> they do a recap of 4 on the beginning of 5 so its fine
[2:05:15] <%RubberFistFight> @NeroInfinite yeah he's hit the level of frustration where the mistakes compound upon one another until you're suddenly being killed by hollows in undead burg again.
[2:05:16] <SirKezington> There's a "Previously on..." in Gears 5
[2:05:17] <Sokumotanaka> The saddest thing about gears 5 is it's existence
[2:05:21] <%42nfl19> yeah 3 was a good ending for me
[2:05:21] <%AnIrishPapaya> Good thing that didnt happen to God of War
[2:05:25] <Asuxley> there are three more after 2?
[2:05:27] <ScreamLord> I liked the part where Marcas killed himself and his ghost steals his son's beard
[2:05:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Yeah my friend worked hard on it and nearly every game he touches does well...but usually isn't popular at its time
[2:05:29] <%HRDSalami654> @AngriestPat Yeah, but if you have Game Pass you might as well play it.
[2:05:30] <%InugamiTheHound> I love gears 1-3 and 4 books, yeah gears 4 is really bad I didn't care about them
[2:05:34] <gimmickypizza> It’s didn’t need open world elements
[2:05:37] <chaos2frozen> @VritraReiRei stacking headshot damage melts this boss though. I'll say mix up between launch and guns so that you'll always bee laying on some damage
[2:05:37] <Arts_Shadow2> Mushroom pizza, the hard way.
[2:05:46] <Mister_McDerp> gears 1-3 were great
[2:05:46] <DomunDomunDomun> Gears 5 got bautista, tho.
[2:05:55] <%HRDSalami654> $2 for it right now.
[2:06:01] <%Piemen99> when did pat get the turn enemies into friends
[2:06:12] <%d00msdaydan> gears lore is actually lowkey fire, too bad nobody takes it seriously because shootbang kill the bugs
[2:06:14] <%Piemen99> ability
[2:06:17] <+Calek> a couple streams ago?
[2:06:18] <%NeroInfinite> A while a go
[2:06:22] <SirKezington> This Boss gives me Barinade vibes
[2:06:27] <onetrueking27> the 1 good thing about gears 4 was the railgun, it was pretty cool
[2:06:29] <asddsa28> you might need more energy to pull this off
[2:06:31] <+TaylOctopus91> I kinda still want to try getting the 1 through 3 or 4 collection since my 360 version of 1 had a progression bug I experienced in a section where you had to push a car for cover
[2:06:32] <Captain_Joe1911> atpCap
[2:06:33] <Arts_Shadow2> ugh...
[2:06:36] <cureneckbeard> party cliff
[2:06:37] <%Dr_Mooose> oof
[2:06:39] <a_mad_dragon> HABEEB IT
[2:06:42] <%RubberFistFight> yeah man i think you need to be more swole to do this
[2:06:42] <Ralfclogs> @angriestpat watch out now you made fun of gears 4 it's going to be rude to you on twitter
[2:06:45] <%alexandrecau> how can this be
[2:06:48] <ScreamLord> Battle Kid returns
[2:06:48] <%grayjammer> You dont have to do this one *now*
[2:06:48] <chaos2frozen> ignore the adds just keep moving around
[2:06:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> This actually looks really tough
[2:06:53] <+Jimboq> I do :)
[2:06:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> That reminds me I need to get him a game because he got drunk one day and gifted me Neir automata because I didn't play it yet
[2:06:55] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it's fine just go do some grinding offscreen Kappa

[2:06:59] <majindusto> Naruto: BELIEVE IT
[2:07:16] <%Teyaric> I killed him in two without the shield. just HUSTLE harder.
[2:07:25] <Reanimator83> Hovering helps because your not getting hit by splash damage
[2:07:27] <ammobasket> Hell yeah!
[2:07:31] <majindusto> Suuuuuuuuuuuuure you are lol
[2:07:32] <+Jimboq> true
[2:07:34] <%RubberFistFight> that's the spirit!

[2:08:12] <%42nfl19> maybe your lucky suit is not so lucky @angriestpat
[2:08:16] <+TaylOctopus91> When I was stuck on this boss I switched out my Personal mods for better Launch efficiency in first two slots, with my best Health mod in third slot
[2:08:16] <%RubberFistFight> @Soul_Intern SHUT UP NAIL
[2:08:19] <%Teintstein> did Pat just get here or is he dying a bunch to this boss?
[2:08:20] <%Dr_Mooose> this is FF14 right?
[2:08:21] <cureneckbeard> this is the dark souls of scp
[2:08:21] <%worldbrand> your vibe is good and your meat is huge
[2:08:26] <Sodium_Chloride09> Pat this boss is just super tough skeep it up you are doing great
[2:08:27] <+Calek> no but Pat I did it blindfolded with both hands behind my back upside down underwater, it's ezpz!
[2:08:33] <Arts_Shadow2> YOU CAN DO IT!
[2:08:35] <cureneckbeard> kind of pretty.
[2:08:35] <%grayjammer> This area and boss is fucking difficult. i only succeeded due to a glitch. You get no brownie points from me for calling it easy.
[2:08:37] <chaos2frozen> Level 9 enemies, this shit is tough as hell
[2:08:39] <iswearimjustdandy> @soul_intern Neeeeerd
[2:08:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat you are doing better then most people on this boss
[2:08:50] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat this boss is a real bitch - you're doing great
[2:09:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Now you got the pattern
[2:09:03] <%Soul_Intern> @RubberFistFight @iswearimjustdandy Cultured individuals

[2:09:11] <%alexandrecau> oh no he is good
[2:09:23] <%grayjammer> Solid maneuvers
[2:09:24] <%42nfl19> does his shield not work on thos projectiles?

[2:09:58] <%42nfl19> pet elmo NOW
[2:10:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @42nfl19 hes not using his shield
[2:10:00] <%VanaSkiller> P E C K

[2:10:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Let the hate flow through you. USE IT
[2:10:07] <%Teyaric> it's an an reaction vs planning test - it does a wiggle pause wind up watch it like a rathian
[2:10:10] <cureneckbeard> abipopPANTSU
[2:10:14] <SirKezington> I feel like the sound cues are REALLY important, for this.
[2:10:15] <+Fynale> finalYIKES finalKAPPA
[2:10:15] <Delenay> it have seen hp and its toxic around it
[2:10:20] <+SolverCODO> Shield is annoying to use because you can't hurt the boss then
[2:10:20] <%Razputin217> Frustration is getting bigger
[2:10:21] <+rowegd> telekinesis does more damage than gun. You got this.
[2:10:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> \`[T]/
[2:10:21] <+asgard147> Pat, will the shield not work against it's attacks? limesThink
[2:10:24] <bearrier_> this is the same energy as arin fighting that plant in battle kid
[2:10:29] <%worldbrand> apatGib take my energy
[2:10:29] <%Soul_Intern> @Teintstein Yes, but he is Pat
[2:10:29] <%TenderBabyBacon> @doc_ock_rokc Hands are already in the air
[2:10:34] <Delenay> nah not the melee ones
[2:10:36] <%Teintstein> @Soul_Intern fair enough
[2:10:38] <ammobasket> shield does have startup, guys
[2:10:41] <Marpolo13> believe in the power of friendship Pat and you will succeed
[2:10:44] <+TaylOctopus91> Yup, I said that and more when I got stuck here for what felt like forever. Sorry friend. Best of luck!
[2:10:50] <%Soul_Intern> BRUTE FORCE
[2:10:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ded
[2:10:58] <%Teintstein> @Soul_Intern has he changed up his mods to max his health out?
[2:11:00] <%ThatOneGameTester> just don't get hit 4Head
[2:11:04] <+asgard147> Ah, I see limesHmm
[2:11:08] <%grayjammer> I hid behind the platforms, personally, like a big coward bbaby
[2:11:15] <%worldbrand> this game feels like it could use e-tanks
[2:11:18] <iswearimjustdandy> @teintstein i think he just maxed energy and damage
[2:11:23] <%LiquidShake83> I subscribe for omikron tears! Give'm up!
[2:11:25] <%Teintstein> ah, gotcha
[2:11:25] <LixFury> Wheres Axe Legion when you need him Kappa
[2:11:25] <%Soul_Intern> @Teintstein He could RIGTH NOW
[2:11:26] <+TaylOctopus91> *expletives I mean. Lots of swearing. It really does help
[2:11:32] <Delenay> at least you are getting mods while you corpse run
[2:11:37] <twistedj3ster> DAMAGE BOOSTS STACK
[2:11:38] <%NeroInfinite> Did he win
[2:11:46] <%Teintstein> @Soul_Intern le sigh
[2:11:49] <Reanimator83> Hovering and dashing are best
[2:11:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> Yeah! Fuck Damage! Like with Batman and Catwoman
[2:11:52] <%flyingavocad0s> I just stayed in the air and dodged
[2:11:55] <%Zombrocom> So this game do checkpoints or like, respawns
[2:11:56] <%Soul_Intern> @Teintstein He didnt, HE IS PAT
[2:11:59] <iswearimjustdandy> @twistedj3ster doesnt he know it stacks?
[2:12:01] <+RogueMinja> I wonder what stacking damage boosts on pierce is like.
[2:12:17] <%Soul_Intern> @RogueMinja Rocket launcher
[2:12:24] <%Bad1uck> @zombrocom bonfires
[2:12:25] <%NeroInfinite> Damage boost is good for these armoed fuck boys
[2:12:41] <%Zombrocom> Ah
[2:12:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat From what I've seen on the patterns. Shield for projectiles. holding shield baits punches. Punches can be blocked by pillars but baits out gas.
[2:12:54] <Arts_Shadow2> Stick and move champ.
[2:12:54] <%d00msdaydan> go do those hiss nodes tho
[2:12:58] <%LiquidShake83> suffer!
[2:13:01] <ammobasket> gotta dodge that mushroom's Dempsey Roll
[2:13:06] <Mister_McDerp> flying seems bad to do
[2:13:06] <+Jaysky> That must have hurt
[2:13:07] <%Soul_Intern> IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
[2:13:11] <%42nfl19> @angriestpat are there any mods to increase your telekinesis damage just for this fight?
[2:13:14] <%Zombrocom> Hm. Levitation seems to be a bad idea.
[2:13:15] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Eundoling
[2:13:15] <%EmiinV> that sounded brutal
[2:13:16] <%Monkeyweed21> you should give yourself extra health
[2:13:17] <ape_hawk> this is why im glad i maxed launch early
[2:13:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Scream is to get you ontop of pillars
[2:13:23] <+zackalan> has pat still not crafted the explosive gun?
[2:13:23] <%Teyaric> shatter, keep blapping, and focus on your footwork?
[2:13:25] <%arancet> @AngriestPat i stayed behind the platform every time there wasnt gas, only popped out to throw
[2:13:26] <SleepyMaribo> this... seems like the boss has to many attacks tha ttrack super hard
[2:13:26] <ape_hawk> maxed launch is so fucking good
[2:13:31] <+nekodelic> anders6Angrysip
[2:13:34] <a_mad_dragon> just win, pat 4Head
[2:13:37] <asddsa28> evade engry
[2:13:38] <%Bad1uck> @arts_shadow2 well he's got the stick part down lol
[2:13:42] <%MrBorisMakarov> rooSip
[2:13:44] <Marpolo13> where is the win mod
[2:13:45] <%Soul_Intern> CRAZY TALK
[2:13:48] <SirKezington> Is is possible to just get super close?
[2:13:50] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat dodge efficiency
[2:13:51] <%grayjammer> only way to increase launch damage ius upgrading it
[2:13:52] <%Laecerelius> reduce evade/throw cost more so you can do it more often?
[2:13:53] <BlindGato> You need TIME STOP
[2:14:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Try Spin?
[2:14:02] <+cafefunk> Hi Pat bunnycIAO
[2:14:03] <+zackalan> @angriestpat have you built the explovise mode on your gun?
[2:14:07] <iswearimjustdandy> @marpolo13 it was patched out
[2:14:08] <RupanSen> can't you use axe legion in this fight?
[2:14:09] <%Soul_Intern> Try SPEEN
[2:14:34] <iswearimjustdandy> @angriestpat have you tried using ripple?
[2:14:40] <%Teyaric> try Shatter! damage up and choke gives it a fat blapp
[2:14:40] <Marpolo13> @iswearimjustdandy damn Keepo
[2:14:44] <%grayjammer> His spin isnt as useful as grip cuz he hasnt upgraded it
[2:14:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RupanSen not in the framerate dimension
[2:14:56] <RupanSen> @doc_ock_rokc damn
[2:15:06] <ape_hawk> win?

[2:15:46] <+asgard147> NICE limesPoggers
[2:15:48] <Arts_Shadow2> Run Forest!
[2:15:54] <%Soul_Intern> CAN HE DO IT?
[2:15:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Lizard0TM its more flood/infested but yeah
[2:15:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I believe in you
[2:15:58] <iswearimjustdandy> Pat doing it!
[2:15:59] <%LiquidShake83> suffer!
[2:16:21] <meowarco> I wish this boss had worked for me, this looks fun.
[2:16:23] <Arts_Shadow2> Run good-er
[2:16:26] <%Soul_Intern> nO
[2:16:27] <%shockzndrawe> is this ctrl+alt_delete?
[2:16:27] <%Monkeyweed21> DODGE
[2:16:28] <%worldbrand> that shit's mean
[2:16:29] <Delenay> throw more
[2:16:29] <%Soul_Intern> No he cannot
[2:16:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Roars are punches
[2:16:31] <%Lizard0TM> @doc_ock_rokc Ye like a thresher maw got infested by the flood
[2:16:32] <Captain_Joe1911> atpSpiner
[2:16:33] <%marsanta> You did kill an arm that time
[2:16:33] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Try staying close to its body. It's AI has a hard time keeping track of you that way.
[2:16:39] <iswearimjustdandy> Closer man!
[2:16:42] <krymzen5> your bullets
[2:16:42] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat you shot its ball
[2:16:43] <Delenay> more direct hits?
[2:16:44] <%shockzndrawe> crack open that drinky drink
[2:16:45] <Patzzki217> you hit the blue part
[2:16:46] <%grayjammer> you did enough damage to it
[2:16:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> Two bombs and bullets
[2:16:48] <%marsanta> The arms must have their own life bars for their blue ball
[2:16:50] <Daxalog> You shot its blue spot
[2:16:53] <asddsa28> you but a boom in its sweet spot then shot it
[2:16:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Shooting at the blue "eye" and 2 bombs on it
[2:16:56] <ammobasket> smacked the bulb
[2:16:56] <%Laecerelius> the bombs seem to be the best way to damage it
[2:16:59] <+regularjimmy88> Are you going to be watchng the FF7 TGS presentation?
[2:17:08] <iswearimjustdandy> @angriestpat you hit the blue part with big damage
[2:17:15] <shevan123> i think the biggest problem are the side arms that pinch off too much health at once
[2:17:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> is pat the yellow king
[2:17:32] <%Laecerelius> unfortunately grabbing the bombs off of the ceiling seems rather dodgy
[2:17:40] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat fwiw I beat this boss by maxing my health, spamming bombs, and hitting it with pierce
[2:17:45] <+TaylOctopus91> I never managed it in my game, but I'm pretty sure it's doing enough damage to the blue glowing weak points that makes the arms pop
[2:17:49] <iswearimjustdandy> @pookiedaexzile no
[2:17:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat do you have the explosive gun?
[2:17:57] <%Soul_Intern> KINDA PRETTY
[2:17:59] <%Soul_Intern> ERGH
[2:18:00] <paakyu> monkaS
[2:18:09] <iswearimjustdandy> @doc_ock_rokc you mean pierce?
[2:18:13] <ammobasket> DID SOMEONE CALL ME PRETTY
[2:18:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ammobasket no
[2:18:30] <meowarco> This boss glitched out for me and didn't move so I just shot it in the face
[2:18:33] <%Razputin217> SERPENTINE
[2:19:01] <iswearimjustdandy> @meowarco apparently thats a known bug
[2:19:01] <%Teintstein> I think @doc_ock_rokc means Charge
[2:19:02] <%Soul_Intern> HES DOING IT CHAT
[2:19:21] <%LiquidShake83> suffer!
[2:19:21] <$drbuttss> do big damage
[2:19:23] <%worldbrand> holy shit
[2:19:24] <Arts_Shadow2> Go left
[2:19:25] <%shockzndrawe> apatBig death
[2:19:26] <%Soul_Intern> Oop
[2:19:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Welp
[2:19:28] <Mister_McDerp> don't fly
[2:19:28] <Delenay> you had it
[2:19:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> ouch
[2:19:29] <ammobasket> oooooooo
[2:19:30] <iswearimjustdandy> Big money no whammies
[2:19:38] <%Razputin217> Geometry fucked ya there
[2:19:39] <$drbuttss> wlecome to die
[2:19:39] <%shockzndrawe> havin fun Pat?
[2:19:42] <SomersaultJustice> be more perfect
[2:19:44] <transporterthesequel> Did he figure out the pillars are moderately safe from charges?
[2:19:46] <VritraReiRei> Just don'
[2:19:46] <%Teintstein> huh, it looks like there might be a second phase when one of the claws gets killed
[2:19:48] <Delenay> i dont think this area/fight was made with levitate in mind
[2:19:49] <asddsa28> you dont doge after they come at you
[2:19:55] <%Teintstein> the energy pills were different?
[2:19:58] <Madbearv> get gud
[2:20:00] <Patzzki217> this boss is fucked
[2:20:05] <%Soul_Intern> Just get gud
[2:20:05] <VritraReiRei> Just don't get hit 4Head
[2:20:06] <Delenay> i think you sequence broke and made it worse
[2:20:07] <%Mr_Strut> Just don't make mistakes then
[2:20:08] <chambatron> So Dark Souls?
[2:20:09] <%ThatOneGameTester> apatBig apatMenace
[2:20:11] <Sitromxe> Get good scrub.
[2:20:11] <%Soul_Intern> Like Dark Souls
[2:20:14] <iswearimjustdandy> Dooooooodge!
[2:20:14] <jtdobyns> Damn. he can come back to it.... level up health and his force through then come back to boss.
[2:20:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> remnant but with flying
[2:20:16] <Patzzki217> it was literally the hardest thing in this game
[2:20:17] <Rexwarrior1> hey pat love u
[2:20:18] <+JustToWatch> use telekinesis instead of your gun pat, it's clearly not working
[2:20:21] <a_mad_dragon> just don't make mistakes 4Head
[2:20:26] <%Razputin217> wait till the Tomassi fight
[2:20:33] <iswearimjustdandy> @justtowatch he likes the gun too much
[2:20:38] <VritraReiRei> Well, These ARE Optional
[2:20:40] <+SolverCODO> Tomassi was surprisingly difficult
[2:20:45] <%luckysteak> whoa, just got here. when did this become "the last of us"?
[2:20:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat try different guns?
[2:20:52] <%Teintstein> Tomassi was also a bitch to kill
[2:20:57] <%flyingavocad0s> Not even close to tomassi
[2:21:00] <%Teintstein> mostly because of the inviso-assholes
[2:21:01] <iamnotaparrot> it's a metroidvania. come back when you're more powered up.
[2:21:10] <Cherokia666> Not the hardest, but pretty hard. I remember taking a few tries with this. Not easy. Don't remember how I won, just that it was "barely"
[2:21:30] <+SolverCODO> Yeah took me a few tries too and I just barely won
[2:21:40] <%LiquidShake83> suffer!
[2:21:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Man I want a real Castlevania
[2:21:42] <iamnotaparrot> dash is your friend. tons of I frames.
[2:21:48] <viciousgrim> BibleThump
[2:21:50] <VritraReiRei> I found all the optional stuff to be INCREDIBLY hard compared to the rest of the game
[2:21:51] <%Razputin217> DAM SUN
[2:21:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Try Spin?
[2:21:52] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan forgot wallet at home, spent all day at work. barely got to eats
[2:21:55] <%SammyOVision> Shield those fast projectiles?
[2:21:57] <+TaylOctopus91> Yeah, this and the rematch with Tomassi proved to be the most infuriating parts for me.
[2:21:57] <Captain_Joe1911> atpCap
[2:21:59] <+Estuko> also what in the heck is that giant eldritch horro
[2:21:59] <transporterthesequel> Pat you gotta remember the bombs bruv
[2:22:03] <asddsa28> you must fly and doge when it gets to hafe helth it looks like
[2:22:03] <+SolverCODO> with a streamer tax I could see this being very difficult
[2:22:12] <majindusto> PLANT 42 IS KICKING YOUR ASS!!!
[2:22:16] <%Teyaric> It's the game's super-boss, yeah.
[2:22:18] <%TimetodiveLTX> this dodging pattern reminds me of virtual on
[2:22:18] <mat2501> stay flying, thats how I did it
[2:22:21] <%Soul_Intern> apatBig Dark Souls moment
[2:22:22] <Cherokia666> Maybe dodge and big damage only?
[2:22:24] <@Pandora_Prime> PJSalt apatBig
[2:22:28] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Focus on the arms first. Don't shoot the flower.
[2:22:31] <%worldbrand> was that projectile hell from the side arms?
[2:22:35] <Caidezes> Maybe you could try shooting the weak points instead of just tossing rocks at them.
[2:22:35] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat I beat this by staying in the air and dodging
[2:22:36] <+JustToWatch> then leave and do it later
[2:22:42] <+TaylOctopus91> Chat, it really is a crazy insane fight. Ease off Pat a bit?
[2:22:42] <Arts_Shadow2> kill right left then center?
[2:22:47] <%Teyaric> FLY!
[2:23:05] <%Soul_Intern> @TaylOctopus91 No he must be perfect in everyway
[2:23:09] <+xenogre> have you tried using the shield ability to block the bolts?
[2:23:10] <%alexandrecau> got the arm
[2:23:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> One down!
[2:23:20] <iamnotaparrot> "I hate it when the game makes itself harder"
[2:23:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Run other way
[2:23:34] <%stovetopism> jesus thats a lot of projectiles
[2:23:35] <+TaylOctopus91> @soul_intern Touché
[2:23:35] <%LiquidShake83> suffer!
[2:23:36] <%Soul_Intern> DO IT
[2:23:38] <%Soul_Intern> Aw
[2:23:42] <asddsa28> close
[2:23:45] <%Teyaric> You know you can kill an arm now, though!
[2:23:47] <%Soul_Intern> You can do it Pa
[2:23:48] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This is tough.
[2:23:50] <majindusto> SUFFER
[2:23:51] <artoflec> i didnt quite see what hit you to get you in the Red that time
[2:23:55] <+VideoGameTim_> im glad this wasnt just me, some of this side content is FUCKED
[2:23:57] <Caidezes> Shooting seems to work a lot better on the arms.
[2:24:01] <iswearimjustdandy> Big fun
[2:24:13] <cureneckbeard> dump the goo
[2:24:13] <%LiquidShake83> stop running
[2:24:14] <%NeroInfinite> Shield up on a platform at that point
[2:24:15] <%Monkeyweed21> shield
[2:24:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat when it drops the bombs do shield and leveitate up top
[2:24:19] <+asgard147> Are you sure you can't block them?
[2:24:21] <Cherokia666> i had a lot of flight upgrades at this point. I did this pretty late in the game
[2:24:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah. There seems like there's a part where everything turns red and your fucked.
[2:24:29] <b1gboss007> you cand dash while you fly
[2:24:32] <%luckysteak> would hte pierce gun be better?
[2:24:41] <%Soul_Intern> Oh, that helps
[2:24:44] <mat2501> relying too much on throwing stuff, fly, shoot weak spot and dodge
[2:24:50] <+zcairstrike> Is the turns red an enrage timer OR a health threshold?
[2:24:52] <Cherokia666> welp
[2:24:55] <%TimetodiveLTX> if the bullets are coming from your side, dash forward or backward. if they're coming from in front, dash left or right
[2:24:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Where did these fucks come from@
[2:24:57] <iswearimjustdandy> @luckysteak yeah probably
[2:25:05] <+asgard147> The fuck did they come from?! limesHeck
[2:25:28] <%Ninestempest> @zcairstrike red screen means low health
[2:25:32] <%devanmuse> the mold guys followed him down
[2:25:36] <Reanimator83> From above. Pat keep running past them and they follow him
[2:25:44] <%ursusbearrammage> pat
[2:25:45] <iswearimjustdandy> @zcairstrike pat is covering the health bar
[2:25:51] <%LiquidShake83> suffer!
[2:25:55] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Jesus Christ
[2:25:56] <%Ninestempest> WOW
[2:25:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> off
[2:25:57] <transporterthesequel> wao they did not like that!
[2:25:57] <%NeroInfinite> wow the fuck
[2:25:58] <Kaijudomage> LUL
[2:25:59] <+m0nk3y80y> That mold is hard
[2:25:59] <+zcairstrike> Oh, durr, that'd be why. I thought the goes red was referring to something else.
[2:25:59] <%derekwst3> bitched slapped
[2:26:00] <cureneckbeard> 3
[2:26:00] <%Dakuu75> god-damn dude. that's brutal
[2:26:01] <%Ninestempest> This boss looks fucking awful
[2:26:01] <artoflec> wtf even hit yo there
[2:26:02] <%Dr_Mooose> oww
[2:26:03] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> that was a hard counter
[2:26:03] <%miguelrod777> jesus
[2:26:04] <%Virokwet> just stop getting hit /s
[2:26:07] <%TimetodiveLTX> wow
[2:26:07] <cureneckbeard> ^
[2:26:07] <%LiquidShake83> take a break
[2:26:12] <crushing_hubris> Is easy mode selectable yet?
[2:26:14] <Cherokia666> Maybe later?
[2:26:14] <%derekwst3> sun down
[2:26:15] <Delenay> more dashes?
[2:26:18] <%TimetodiveLTX> ~instant death~
[2:26:22] <%shockzndrawe> just win the game
[2:26:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Aww yeah, I made it.
[2:26:33] <%luckysteak> Pierce! get your shots off without spending a lot of time firing at it
[2:26:41] <%derekwst3> sun super down
[2:26:44] <%Monkeyweed21> go dump some paint
[2:26:53] <%m0nk3y80y> m0nk3y80y subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:26:56] <%Ninestempest> this is not sundown this is dumb optional bosses
[2:27:00] <%Ninestempest> in a game with shitty shooting
[2:27:02] <iswearimjustdandy> @well at least youve now learned things the game already showed you
[2:27:08] <Blank9> Remedy doing what they are best known for: terrible boss fights
[2:27:12] <Reanimator83> Call Paige and see her beat it on the first try
[2:27:15] <@thenefftw> You know what I think the problem is, Pat? I think you're losing health. Stop that, it's not good for you.
[2:27:20] <%Teyaric> the shooting is goddamn amazing on grip, shatter, and spin, man, what are you on about?
[2:27:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Looks like I missed quite a bit. Can't wait for the vod
[2:27:40] <%Soul_Intern> NICE
[2:27:42] <+rowegd> IIRC when the side tentacles did they drop health.
[2:27:43] <%StaceMcGate> SeemsGood1000 SeemsGood1000 Hey Pat, just finished File 11 and I don't get why Japanese devs keep pushing fakeout endings. This whole game has been characters refusing to tell us what going on and at this point any resolution they provide will not feel worth it after all this context blueballing.
[2:27:51] <Arts_Shadow2> RAGE MY SOLDIERS!
[2:27:52] <krymzen5> ur guns hurts more
[2:27:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bait a punch lay into it
[2:28:11] <%Ninestempest> @Teyaric if you mean me, i just think the overall shooting and combat design in this game is garbage
[2:28:12] <%derekwst3> i started shield hero manga yesterday, now im caught up......
[2:28:27] <+VideoGameTim_> My best advice pat is honestly just spam Launch as much as possible. When I finally beat him it took like 20 seconds
[2:28:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> almost there!
[2:28:36] <%LiquidShake83> suffer!
[2:28:39] <%Soul_Intern> HES FEELING IT
[2:28:40] <+TaylOctopus91> It might be worth putting on the back burner and come back with upgraded Levitate and Shield skills. Or upgraded Launch skill for more damage.
[2:28:43] <worldbrand> what are you supposed to do about that? hide?
[2:28:43] <Caidezes> Just shoot them, yes.
[2:28:45] <Sitromxe> @AngriestPat Seconding the use of Pierce. Wait for the lunge attack them shoot the arms point blank in the weak point
[2:28:47] <Delenay> its changing mechanics almost at random
[2:28:47] <+Estuko> @StaceMcGate I like my problem to be there and everyone's "yeah, we gotta take care of it." But I also enjoy a plan totally not going as intended
[2:28:52] <majindusto> HE'S LEARNING
[2:28:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Do they home around cover?
[2:28:56] <Delenay> floor gas for no reason
[2:29:03] <+JustToWatch> make all your personal mods launch cost reducer
[2:29:04] <krymzen5> gun seems way better if u can hit the blue
[2:29:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @King_Wolf_Rigger kinda
[2:29:06] <iswearimjustdandy> @king_wolf_rigger yes
[2:29:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's some miserable missile mechanics lol
[2:29:22] <+SolverCODO> I like that holding them resets/stops their timer
[2:29:26] <Kaijudomage> just shoot the blue things and dodge everything Kappa
[2:29:30] <worldbrand> i dont think it's completely at random, the floor gas is to get you out of cover and different attacks are probably at different HP thresholds
[2:29:32] <VritraReiRei> To be honest, I didn't even realize they had a weak point, I just spammed Launch Explosive Mold at it :D
[2:29:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> This is just just jack and daxter 5
[2:29:42] <%Laecerelius> You could probably upgrade your pierce at this point, Pat
[2:29:46] <%StaceMcGate> @Estuko I'm 40 hours into this game, just killed evil god lord of the universe, and I still don't know what the villains plan was or the backstories of any of the main characters.
[2:30:04] <%Laecerelius> Sounds like a good plan
[2:30:15] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat you should just eat the mold, looks a lot easier
[2:30:17] <%flyingavocad0s> @king_wolf_rigger The game wants you to dodge them
[2:30:33] <%FrostMass22> Only losers don't give up
[2:30:51] <kc703> ?
[2:30:56] <+Estuko> @StaceMcGate oh, well then lol. I have not played this game lmao
[2:31:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> its not giving up...its starting over
[2:31:04] <%TimetodiveLTX> winners don't do commitment
[2:31:04] <Arts_Shadow2> Hmm... New Dr Stone sub is out.
[2:31:13] <krymzen5> no ur pretty
[2:31:15] <cureneckbeard> kind of pretty
[2:31:15] <Manjove> Quitters are the greatest of heroes!
[2:31:16] <+Estuko> Stubs the Zombie says, winners don't use drugs
[2:31:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @flyingavocad0s Dodging didn't seem to much. Looked like the missiles even changed direction.
[2:31:20] <%LiquidShake83> dont hhide
[2:31:21] <iswearimjustdandy> @stacemcgate has pat found info you never bothered to pick up?
[2:31:27] <Kaijudomage> nice shooting tex
[2:31:30] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Its looks like that is too slow
[2:31:32] <%FrostMass22> It takes a truly brave person to accept failure
[2:31:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat maybe try scatter on the punch arms
[2:31:39] <+Estuko> Jesus Joel !
[2:31:49] <krymzen5> look at tht dmg
[2:31:56] <%ThatOneGameTester> yikes this fight
[2:31:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> SO much red
[2:31:56] <worldbrand> that's fucked up
[2:31:58] <%RubberFistFight> @Estuko nope, winners go home and fuck the prom queen. Then they do drugs.
[2:32:03] <%Soul_Intern> HOW IS HE ALIVE
[2:32:06] <%LiquidShake83> suffer!
[2:32:07] <Reanimator83> HP on the floor Pat
[2:32:08] <%devanmuse> EVERYTHING'S EXPLODING
[2:32:08] <+Estuko> @RubberFistFight FeelsBadMan I wasn't prom queen
[2:32:10] <Captain_Joe1911> :D
[2:32:11] <%Soul_Intern> There you go
[2:32:12] <Arts_Shadow2> ouch.
[2:32:14] <Kaijudomage> weakpoint
[2:32:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> what?
[2:32:15] <%FrostMass22> That's a lotta damage!
[2:32:17] <ape_hawk> because YOU HIT THE GLOWING PART
[2:32:17] <+reluctant_monkey> mortis
[2:32:17] <%SammyOVision> You hit the weak spot.
[2:32:19] <cureneckbeard> you were already red
[2:32:20] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat because you believed in yourself
[2:32:20] <krymzen5> its the headshot plus dmg
[2:32:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's trap HP
[2:32:33] <joylent_blue> no but there's HP on the floor tho
[2:32:35] <%RubberFistFight> @Estuko me either. so this is what it sounds like when doves cry :'(
[2:32:36] <%Virokwet> is the poison instant?
[2:32:36] <%grayjammer> so dont stay in thhe poison deathpit for so long
[2:32:38] <mat2501> dash through it
[2:32:40] <%flyingavocad0s> @king_wolf_rigger You're supposed to wait till the last second
[2:32:41] <krymzen5> i think the blue counts as hs
[2:32:43] <%derekwst3> Girls its time to stop watching for a secound, it will make him big strong
[2:32:49] <Patzzki217> destroy some duplicate mods
[2:32:50] <%FrostMass22> Pick up the hp, it'll heal you from the death gas
[2:32:51] <%king_wragles> Ya, take the 30 damage to heal for 35
[2:32:51] <%LiquidShake83> no be coward!
[2:32:53] <a_mad_dragon> just resist the poison 4Head
[2:32:54] <%StaceMcGate> @iswearimjustdandy Nah, I know more than Pat at this point cause I've played it more. This just seems to be a recurring trend among JRPGs for the TRUE ending to be a NewGame+ scenario. The big problem with Astral Chain is that its obviously saving all its plot revelations until you clear the final secret chapter
[2:32:55] <%king_wragles> LoGiC
[2:32:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @flyingavocad0s makes sense.
[2:32:55] <+Bad1uck> isn't there mods that increase HP succ range?
[2:32:57] <worldbrand> does it have any tech for you getting into its face or is it like a souls boss where its crotch is shockingly safe
[2:33:03] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat it does damage because it kind of blocks your direct telekinetic attacks
[2:33:14] <Reanimator83> Get HP with Dash
[2:33:14] <%RubberFistFight> @Patzzki217 but what if he needs them later? Kappa
[2:33:39] <Patzzki217> @RubberFistFight fuck
[2:33:39] <%grayjammer> You can heal more that the poison damage fiel tho
[2:33:54] <Garry_Guyface> Astral Blip: The Prequel to Astral Chain
[2:34:06] <b1gboss007> i beat it by floating all the time and spaming dash when the arms moved
[2:34:32] <%SammyOVision> Pat do we really need seize speed on a boss with no adds?
[2:34:33] <Reanimator83> @b1gboss007 same
[2:34:42] <%Teintstein> @b1gboss007 same
[2:34:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> kinda pretty
[2:34:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> How can my mold1 boss be so cute
[2:35:03] <%Teintstein> I can't remember if I even tried to kill the side arms or if I just spam launched the middle eye
[2:35:08] <chambatron> The charge shot does a shit ton of damage tho
[2:35:32] <+Estuko> Squid1 uwu Squid4 @doc_ock_rokc
[2:35:36] <kc703> yea i would just go for main
[2:35:49] <worldbrand> scary
[2:35:58] <Arts_Shadow2> Big the poison.
[2:35:59] <alexandrecau> both arm gone
[2:36:00] <joylent_blue> monkaS
[2:36:09] <Reanimator83> Spam the fuck out of the dash in the air

[3:11:28] <%RubberFistFight> @Soul_Intern lol sorry I'm just messing with you. This game is weird and I hesitate to call it good, but it's nowhere NEAR as not-good as Beyond Become Fucks.
[3:11:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> AND THE ADL DESERVE IT
[3:11:37] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat to answer the inevitable question - no - you can't find Marshall in Black Rock

[3:12:13] <%Razputin217> Maybe we’ll find out in the DLC Kappa
[3:12:13] <vonmaultke> That guard is the best part of this game to me <3 FeelsGoodMan
[3:12:27] <%king_wragles> @SolverCODO closest I can find is cognitive dissonance, you?
[3:12:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> it's the force
[3:12:31] <%ScreamLord> apatGoblin
[3:12:37] <AdmiralButtloaf> your yellow suit makes you look like an asshole

[3:13:05] <ShichiNoBushi> So would Budhism be fundamentally opposed to the Hiss?
[3:13:09] <%RubberFistFight> so basically it's the compelling voice from the Bene Gesserit?
[3:13:11] <Centauren> I mean "Cognitive Collapse" would just mean that they lose the ability to think
[3:13:13] <Marpolo13> oh COURSE it's different
[3:13:13] <+Estuko> His name HAD to be Dylan, that son of a bitch
[3:13:17] <Marpolo13> of*

[3:14:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> YO
[3:14:09] <+SolverCODO> All I found on cognitive collapse was about forming an entire outlook out of a few ideas, sometimes unrelated to reality. So like, living in concrete lies you tell yourself i guess, being out of touch with reality
[3:14:10] <%Laecerelius> Great
[3:14:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I prefer aft-shadowing

[3:27:53] <Shwepie> No immediately looking up to where the camera was. Disappointment.
[3:27:55] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It happened SUPER briefly the during the first conversation for a split second, like a blink, I thought it was just the game being dumb.

[3:28:12] <%Capta1n_H3nry> So
[3:28:12] <+SolverCODO> it's all just super powers and dream logic though, he's not literally the camera, maybe just vaguely aware of the camera

[3:37:18] <%grayjammer> N O I T U A C
[3:37:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Estuko how could you curse me like this. That girl is crazy attractive and nice
[3:37:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Estuko, this is like the 4th time you've mentioned goth girl at gamestop. Are you the goth girl at gamestop?
[3:37:26] <%waltzqueen> @Teintstein I put my OOP down and {REDACT} it
[3:37:26] <ShichiNoBushi> There's an SCP that is a small chamber with two mirrors at slight angles to each other making a perceived circle of reflections inside. When something/someone is inside, it is closed, and a mechanism is activated, whatever is inside is replaced with an alternate, usually left-right reversed version of what was originally inside.
[3:37:29] <+SolverCODO> Pat doesn't brute force, he brute smarts
[3:37:34] <+SolverCODO> ..........
[3:37:35] <transporterthesequel> you FOOL pat does not read!
[3:37:39] <VritraReiRei> Does anyone know how to play back reversed audio? I want to be able to understand what they are saying here
[3:37:41] <iswearimjustdandy> @teintstein @reanimator83 finally some culture
[3:37:54] <+SolverCODO> that does not do it
[3:37:58] <%InugamiTheHound> nope
[3:37:58] <%Starlight_Gamer> i dont get whats heppening

[3:38:00] <%Soul_Intern> I do not understand
[3:38:01] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I think you reversed one side.
[3:38:02] <%Teintstein> @VritraReiRei he'll find a tape through the mirror with the recording reversed
[3:38:04] <+Grayhammatter> that's not the do it
[3:38:10] <+Estuko> @Sphincter_Spelunker I ALMOST was, lmao. I think it's funny too. Like our version of Nurse Joy.
[3:38:12] <%PauliusMaximus> i cant see anything changing
[3:38:13] <Meta_Four> @VritraReiRei You can reverse audio files with Audacity. It's a free program.

[4:04:57] <%grayjammer> Ugh the Tennyson Report

[4:10:35] <$drfaustisdead> You hear that Pat Persona 6 and 7 our our future.
[4:10:36] <%Meekest> Pat have you seen all the shit you've done so far
[4:10:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[4:10:36] <+RogueMinja> So shit like this doesn't happen.
[4:10:37] <+SolverCODO> Think about it. There's a reason this gun was also Excalibur and Mjolnir
[4:10:37] <%FirearmsInstructor> apatBig apatWrong
[4:10:40] <fusedforms> given how often they fuck up, the magic gun seems pretty important
[4:10:41] <transporterthesequel> WAO
[4:10:42] <+king_of_beggars> Because they're in charge of magic bullshit that needs to be shot.
[4:10:42] <Caidezes> Shit gets loose if there's no Director.
[4:10:44] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat the gun has some strict criteria
[4:10:45] <%Laecerelius> Respect the power of GUN
[4:10:47] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat thnk normies can take out the mold plant?
[4:10:47] <+QueequegTheater> @SolverCODO excuse me, what
[4:10:57] <AdmiralButtloaf> magic roaches
[4:10:58] <transporterthesequel> Oh they are level 4 babies lol
[4:10:58] <areallygoodname> how would you punish your subordinates without a gun?
[4:11:00] <ape_hawk> also getting the gun is the way you can communicate (or at least understand) the Board
[4:11:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> You are already proving you are doing a better job solving problems so far
[4:11:03] <%spacehouse> The Board demands/requires it
[4:11:03] <ActualNobody6400> Has to be a chosen one because reasons
[4:11:10] <Sphincter_Spelunker> How many times are teenagers gonna face themselves. When are we gonna get into phobias
[4:11:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat the gun used to be Excalibur and Mojinr Only one person can be its user
[4:11:11] <%hntronium> Pat everyone was pretty much fucked until you came along
[4:11:14] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat only parautilitarians can use the gun
[4:11:20] <+SolverCODO> @QueequegTheater the early document explaining the service weapon mentions it was various famous weapons, including mjolnir, excalibur, and one other i forget and never heard of
[4:11:21] <Mister_McDerp> the gun is literally excalibur
[4:11:26] <%hntronium> That's a good enough reason to have a prime candidate
[4:11:39] <transporterthesequel> if I had GUN it would be Excalibur all the time
[4:11:48] <%Dakuu75> this is the strangest looking rainbow-ripple-effect... looks like when gasoline reflects a rainbow
[4:11:51] <%hntronium> excaligun
[4:12:00] <+crimsonharvest> did he beated the extremely frustrating mold boss
[4:12:04] <ape_hawk> pat, theres a threshold kids in this area (inside the closed cases room)
[4:12:04] <alexandrecau> the true form of a rainbow
[4:12:14] <Meta_Four> Yeah he killed the mold.
[4:12:15] <Reanimator83> @crimsonharvest yes
[4:12:18] <ZE_Count> The alan wake AWE file is here somewhere if I remember right.
[4:12:26] <+GalacticaPhanto> doesn't one of the Fate GO Sabers have an excalibur
[4:12:28] <%FirearmsInstructor> Are most of these shelters empty now?
[4:12:33] <%Teintstein> yup
[4:12:33] <iswearimjustdandy> @angriestpat closed cases room has trheshold kids
[4:12:34] <+GalacticaPhanto> Excaligun
[4:12:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> How often are there survivors if not?

[4:14:41] <%starotter70> I love this tie in
[4:14:44] <%Soul_Intern> YEYYEYEYEYEY
[4:14:50] <+SolverCODO> Alan was so powerful he accidentally created a fucked up fantasy world with his typewriter/mind
[4:14:52] <+Calek> Clay Steward was in the very beginning of Alan Wake in the dream sequence
[4:15:02] <plzza_kun> so in other words, we'll never get an Alan Wake sequeal... FeelsBadMan
[4:15:02] <$drfaustisdead> @FalseEyeD Remedy has 3 projects in it's pipeline right now. AW 2 maybe incomeing.
[4:15:03] <ape_hawk> yes
[4:15:03] <Caidezes> Alan Wake confirmed psychic.
[4:15:03] <%Meekest> Yes
[4:15:06] <artoflec> i wonder if Quantum Break was supposed to tie into this in a greater way
[4:15:08] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yea
[4:15:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want Alan wake 3 damn it!
[4:15:10] <%rdark_ksu> wake

[4:15:12] <+SolverCODO> Yes, the logo makes it VERY clear
[4:15:12] <FalseEyeD> Yes, the 2nd DLC for Control will be Alan Waker
[4:15:12] <Mister_McDerp> nice
[4:15:13] <iswearimjustdandy> @angriestpat big thank you
[4:15:14] <%grayjammer> Heavily implied
[4:15:14] <%Onlysamfisher > I got paper Mario's face tattooed on my bicep today
[4:15:16] <+Calek> the promo art has Alan Wake art
[4:15:17] <%SammyOVision> The logo for the AWE Dlc is basically the alan wake logo
[4:15:18] <ape_hawk> jesse
[4:15:20] <%Meekest> Who knows
[4:15:22] <+QueequegTheater> Jalan
[4:15:22] <%Dr_Mooose> essej
[4:15:23] <Reanimator83> I hope
[4:15:23] <artoflec> it has both on the logo
[4:15:23] <%Razputin217> Maybe?
[4:15:25] <%king_wragles> @iswearimjustdandy yo, catch the vod later. Twitch saves your spot and everything. You get some rest to do awesome shit tomorrow
[4:15:25] <%stagemage> the logo has alan wake logo in it

[4:15:25] <%Soul_Intern> ALAN PLEASE
[4:15:26] <+twohitgood> that's what it's like sometimes when you're on shrooms. (the room geometry)
[4:15:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Jalan Wakeden
[4:15:28] <worldbrand> Dylan wake calling it now
[4:15:29] <%Meekest> You really don't
[4:15:31] <+SolverCODO> it's a pun on Augmented World Event too, Alan Wake Event. the DLC is called AWE
[4:15:31] <Mister_McDerp> its gonna be esseJ
[4:15:32] <Neo_Kaiser> How? What about the licensing issues?
[4:15:34] <artoflec> ehhhh lol
[4:15:34] <%Monkeyweed21> No you dont
[4:15:34] <%bevyrage> i'm not sur ewhy
[4:15:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Did you do a LP of AW? If so, where can it be found? I actually missed it, if so. I'd like to watch.
[4:15:38] <%republicofu> never played allan wake, is any good?
[4:15:39] <+Calek> American Nightmare is hella short
[4:15:40] <$drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat what if it's Alice it's still A. Wake.
[4:15:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Will you play it on stream?
[4:15:42] <$drfaustisdead> same
[4:15:43] <+xenogre> you don't
[4:15:44] <%Dakuu75> @iswearimjustdandy there are few things as useful as that kind of certification. You're basically a white mage
[4:15:45] <%42nfl19> i missed it, what did pat unlock from the mirror dimension?
[4:15:45] <buckwheat70> So was Alan Wake P1-5 or P7?
[4:15:47] <%bevyrage> not sure why, but i really appreciate this wonk geometry
[4:15:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Alan! So sayeth the airplane raptor.
[4:15:49] <Panquake25> Yep. Loved it
[4:15:56] <%Teintstein> @buckwheat70 we're about to find out
[4:15:57] <transporterthesequel> Nah either you are Meg are P7
[4:16:00] <transporterthesequel> Possibly both
[4:16:01] <+anarachnid> Yooo, just got confirmed for a med school interview!
[4:16:01] <%Soul_Intern> I just want Alan to be freed :(
[4:16:03] <%Monkeyweed21> remember that cop he got killed for drama
[4:16:04] <+Calek> Alan Wake has no powers and he's dealing with all that crap
[4:16:05] <%Sokumotanaka> meh pretty generic
[4:16:08] <ShichiNoBushi> You think Alan Wake should get a modern update?
[4:16:09] <artoflec> is fucking max payne gonna join Jesse, Alan Wake and Quantum Break Man to make paranormal avengers
[4:16:14] <ZE_Count> threshold kids episode somewhere in closed cases
[4:16:16] <%flyingavocad0s> @42nfl19 He got an outfit
[4:16:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShichiNoBushi YES

[4:16:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShichiNoBushi DOUBLE YES
[4:16:47] <artoflec> AWE is what the DLC is called
[4:16:50] <%Zalthia> It isn’t CONFIRMED but he’s in the logo for the dlc, the dlc itself is called AWE, and it will come out around the 10th anniversary of the game (I’ve heard) @angriestpat
[4:16:55] <Cherokia666> JAM

[4:17:05] <+Calek> Sarah Breaker's dad being an Ex-Control agent makes me so happy
[4:17:06] <Zebroneath> With this much info concerning Alan Wake, there HAS to be DLC or a followup for this.
[4:17:17] <%Dakuu75> @iswearimjustdandy doodBro
[4:17:25] <%king_wragles> @iswearimjustdandy huh, that's weird. Anywho people just call the videos on Twitch vods. You could also do what some people do and just bookmark your spot by saying something in chat (e.g. "good night" or "watch here" etc)

[4:23:26] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Calek I don't think it was the N-Gage but you're not wrong.
[4:23:27] <+el_thag> He’s busy been on fire for ever?

[4:23:48] <%velemi> same
[4:23:56] <%Teintstein> no he was yelling at Polaris
[4:24:00] <%Teintstein> "he was alone"
[4:24:01] <ALazo> Maybe Polaris was talking to him
[4:24:02] <cureneckbeard> 1
[4:24:05] <%Kiiper> He was yelling at Polaris
[4:24:08] <Mister_McDerp> he was speaking to polaris
[4:24:08] <Marpolo13> MIND EVIL
[4:24:12] <%flyingavocad0s> Polaris is doing her best

[4:24:33] <+QueequegTheater> Because that's a DEEP fucking Lovecraft cut
[4:24:39] <ALazo> Polaris like the ghost named after the star
[4:24:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> dude got fucked
[4:24:48] <gekizenbu> but yeah mind communication and the hiss is pretty much a lethal combination
[4:24:52] <%grayjammer> Talking to ghosts, which as we all know, isn't ESP Kappa Kappa Kappa
[4:24:55] <gekizenbu> memetic spread is beyond real
[4:24:57] <%hntronium> doesn't sound like boys being boys
[4:24:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> OOF
[4:24:58] <%Teintstein> @QueequegTheater yup, Jesse & Dylan named her Polaris after the star
[4:24:59] <ZE_Count> nice

[4:25:30] <+QueequegTheater> So maybe we just kill Dylan
[4:25:35] <+SolverCODO> You know how if you dunk a sphere into a 2d universe it would only be represented in their world by its cross section? That's what the hiss are, except for sound. They're represented by light and sound but that's just the part we can observe
[4:25:36] <%miguelrod777> so fight the oops
[4:25:37] <ActualNobody6400> cuz they stwong
[4:25:38] <alexandrecau> It was Roberts, it's fine

[4:26:44] <%Teintstein> probably just an easter egg

[4:26:56] <Sphincter_Spelunker> So that's why Kramer was always on edge
[4:27:00] <Valdorick> You're not paranoid if they're REALLY after you.

[4:28:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @starotter70 The upside to having paranoia justified, is that you're not crazy. The downside to it is that you're gonna disappear very soon.

[4:33:05] <$megamonmon123> gg pat
[4:33:05] <areallygoodname> elite gamer senses
[4:33:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Maybe Pat has the ESP
[4:33:10] <+SolverCODO> That was legit a Director Pat moment holy shit
[4:33:11] <%Teintstein> nah
[4:33:13] <%Teintstein> not that
[4:33:16] <$arcielardor> Damn that gun looks fun to use.
[4:33:16] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat is clairvoyant
[4:33:19] <%Dakuu75> how come pat's channel doesn't have that twitch-points junk like Max's channel?
[4:33:19] <%starotter70> Pat's instinctual ball tickle saved him yet again
[4:33:20] <ValidVenasaur> Clairvoyance Rank Up
[4:33:21] <%Soul_Intern> In the other room
[4:33:22] <%hntronium> there, no longer tilted
[4:33:27] <$megamonmon123> morphogenic field theory saved pat
[4:33:28] <+SolverCODO> The OCD, the crazy talk, the frequent brute smarts, Pat is P8
[4:33:29] <%hntronium> good job pat
[4:33:39] <lethallylactic> Fuck that painting in particular
[4:33:41] <Flunkorg> ...no?
[4:33:45] <+el_thag> Hey there’s hidden rooms behind some paintings FYI
[4:33:49] <%Soul_Intern> Hmmmmmm
[4:33:49] <$arcielardor> You can FEEL that gun's recoil through the screen. That's good sound design right there.
[4:33:50] <+SolverCODO> P8 sounds like "pat" if you say it in that one weird voice pat does. COINCIDENCE?
[4:33:52] <%Soul_Intern> Maybe not?
[4:33:58] <Flunkorg> @el_thag shut your mouth lol
[4:34:02] <ミュウレ4242> can yyou fire the big shot while flying? look for breakable walls up high, sort of thing.
[4:34:04] <%Soul_Intern> Oh well
[4:34:07] <%starotter70> @SolverCODO Does that explain why he's so short?
[4:34:19] <%Teintstein> ya, you can fire all the guns while leivtating
[4:34:21] <%StaceMcGate> have I missed the music video?
[4:34:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> did she say ex-spear-ments
[4:34:26] <Marpolo13> super EVIL
[4:34:26] <transporterthesequel> No it's fine
[4:34:27] <%Soul_Intern> RED
[4:34:27] <%Dakuu75> fuck this, indeed
[4:34:28] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy, we in hell
[4:34:29] <%waltzqueen> EVIL
[4:34:30] <%Teintstein> @StaceMcGate nope
[4:34:31] <ZE_Count> Means your next director pat sheesh
[4:34:32] <transporterthesequel> The red lighting is soothing
[4:34:34] <+SolverCODO> @starotter70 it's because he extra dimensional body is actually huge, the Pat we know is just the part we can see
[4:34:34] <%Ion_Laser> Welp...
[4:34:40] <%waltzqueen> damn
[4:34:41] <lols_royce> nothing bad ever happened in a room with red lights
[4:34:45] <+el_thag> Ex-spearmints
[4:34:47] <Marpolo13> pat it's just EVIL. you've dealt with that befre
[4:34:49] <%starotter70> @SolverCODO Oh shit monkaS
[4:34:51] <ミュウレ4242> red jello shoggoth!
[4:34:52] <$arcielardor> I just realized that the red Hiss rooms look like the framerate dimension in Astral Chain!
[4:35:02] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat prime candidates are able to become director
[4:35:13] <%Soul_Intern> :(
[4:35:14] <%starotter70> BibleThump
[4:35:16] <Arts_Shadow2> Magic solve problems.
[4:35:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dylan got all the recessive genes, and Jesse got all the dominant genes
[4:35:21] <Marpolo13> it means you the big shit
[4:35:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> it means you're the director
[4:35:31] <%CherrieVelvet> you get the big chair
[4:35:32] <Wan6Saber> this is why Pat cant play multiplayer games @AngriestPat athUG
[4:35:32] <Mister_McDerp> king arthur was a director
[4:35:33] <ShichiNoBushi> The gun won't kill them, I presume.
[4:35:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat the Board needs a represenative
[4:35:35] <ape_hawk> technically, anyone can become the director, if you can hold the gun
[4:35:38] <ALazo> they talk to the board. They get excaligun. They sit in the biggest chair
[4:35:39] <%hntronium> It means you have the biggest dick energy
[4:35:39] <Nyemmers> fun fact, alan wake is a prime candidate
[4:35:41] <ActualNobody6400> It means you're the real chosen hero
[4:35:41] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat cleanse the control point and then come back here to find a hidden area
[4:35:42] <%aeravon> It means you have the power to exert *control* over the OOPs in the FBC
[4:35:43] <+SolverCODO> Wait Pat there's a secret up there
[4:35:44] <Arts_Shadow2> gun
[4:35:44] <%waltzqueen> but why do they needs supernatural creeps?
[4:35:44] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I hear the chair is comfy
[4:35:49] <%Laecerelius> I'm assuming that the magic gun has high standards
[4:35:56] <+JustToWatch> pat activate the circle
[4:35:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Parautilitarians are the only people who can understand the board
[4:35:56] <%Dakuu75> ppl rather sit on the chair than someone's lap
[4:35:57] <Caidezes> Pat, the gun chooses the Director. They gotta be psychic.
[4:35:57] <%velemi> Pat, because otherwise they die when they pick up the gun
[4:35:57] <+SolverCODO> @AngriestPat there IS a secret room in that red area opposite the objective, up high
[4:35:57] <%superc37> Cuz of the gun
[4:35:59] <+RogueMinja> Go back down that corridor.
[4:36:05] <ape_hawk> because they are fifth dimensional space gods, DUH
[4:36:05] <ミュウレ4242> i guess the point the director at big problems, and hope to uncover scraps they can feed their scientistss.
[4:36:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> 3
[4:36:07] <%ThatOneGameTester> someone has to have the big magic pat
[4:36:07] <+el_thag> There’s always a board & a director & a lighthouse....wait
[4:36:08] <b1gboss007> they are people able to use strong O.O.P. in case of an emergency like this
[4:36:09] <%miguelrod777> because you need powers to keep up with the weird bullshit
[4:36:10] <%starotter70> Well @AngriestPat , you sit in a big chair when you'r in a car right?
[4:36:14] <%bevyrage> ooo~
[4:36:21] <+Grayhammatter> whoa, what the fuck PogChamp
[4:36:22] <ZE_Count> think there s hidden room back at the start of the tracks got to fly I think.
[4:36:26] <%Calek> @AngriestPat there's a hidden room that you can float to at the southern end
[4:36:28] <%Laecerelius> Yeah magic powers seems really useful in this line of work
[4:36:28] <%Teintstein> ya on the right
[4:36:33] <Marpolo13> hm
[4:36:33] <%arancet> @SECRET ROOM IN HERE

[4:36:57] <ape_hawk> ahaha, the game didnt load your mold immunity
[4:36:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why are you no longer dying to mold, btw?
[4:37:02] <ALazo> board must be necessary to the functioning of the organization. Somehow
[4:37:03] <+SolverCODO> not bugs, MOLD
[4:37:08] <+el_thag> Has Pat taken the pill?
[4:37:10] <%Laecerelius> He got an upgrade
[4:37:12] <%jobbedbone> MOLDED BY IT
[4:37:13] <%Soul_Intern> @FirearmsInstructor Pill

[4:37:14] <arkv01> I have bad news, mold is eternal
[4:37:15] <cureneckbeard> he put down some bleach and now the mold is ok
[4:37:18] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Being a para-utilitarian means you have the ability to solve problems and fix the fucky wucky bullshit when it go crazy.... having powers let's you handle things
[4:37:19] <+SolverCODO> more in there
[4:37:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> It not bug its a mold
[4:37:21] <Flunkorg> GO BACK

[4:37:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> more or less
[4:37:34] <transporterthesequel> Yeah there's more in there dude
[4:37:35] <heartlesshealer> Pat, you didn't even look at A wall
[4:37:35] <%arancet> @AngriestPat go back to that room, you missed it
[4:37:35] <%grayjammer> NotLikeThis
[4:37:37] <%Teintstein> I think only parautilitarians can "bond" with objects of power
[4:37:40] <+JustToWatch> something else in the room
[4:37:44] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Soul_Intern @Marpolo13 Thank you. :) I missed a stream or two.

[4:39:02] <%Kiiper> anti perspirant?
[4:39:03] <%starotter70> But you get dirty immediately after you leave the shower @AngriestPat
[4:39:03] <areallygoodname> tomatoDry you callin me stupid
[4:39:03] <%velemi> Being IN the shower is great, but before you get in it's like nah I'll do it in a bit

[4:54:02] <%RubberFistFight> @boxedbit hon hon hon oui oui baguette omelette du fromage
[4:54:03] <+Darren716> The fucks the point of watching more Death Stranding? Isnt that game out in 2 weeks?
[4:54:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Yeah, but I'm also a hot-rodder, and neither of those things are cheap hobbies hahaha.
[4:54:10] <oJxn> @AngriestPat Its 30 mins of footage today
[4:54:15] <digaogrunge> She ran away
[4:54:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @King_Wolf_Rigger His friend was starting a flight school and offered to teach him for 2,500 and a 3,000 painting
[4:54:16] <%velemi> no pat that was the therapy session they spied on her at
[4:54:16] <+Darren716> Like why wouldnt you just wait for it
[4:54:16] <%jobbedbone> I have researched fuckzilla and will never be the same
[4:54:17] <%Ninestempest> @Darren716 yeah but kojima hype or something
[4:54:19] <%grayjammer> The Jesse interviews were the Psychiatrist tapes
[4:54:20] <ミュウレ4242> maybe they didn't. maybe dylan busted her out.
[4:54:20] <asddsa28> cost to cost
[4:54:21] <+SolverCODO> Dog Neil FrankerZ incoming
[4:54:22] <cureneckbeard> maybe she is the control group
[4:54:22] <%Calek> they didn't interview her, they took tapes from her therapy sessions
[4:54:28] <+el_thag> Death Stranding is Nov 9th?
[4:54:28] <%Teintstein> @jobbedbone you're welcome
[4:54:29] <heartlesshealer> They took Dylan as a control and let Jesse grow up free range?
[4:54:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> is it THEY
[4:54:45] <Meta_Four> Seems more like Jesse went to a psychiatrist, who was secretly working for the FBC.
[4:54:46] <%RubberFistFight> @heartlesshealer 100% cruelty-free jesse?
[4:54:49] <artoflec> im guessing its going to be the first gameplay demo..thats usually how TGS goes
[4:54:56] <heartlesshealer> yes
[4:54:58] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat she escaped
[4:54:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger I hear you. Firearms aren't cheap, but ammo adds up super fast, too. :|

[4:55:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> neohO
[4:55:33] <heartlesshealer> please don't tell me I'm right, these streams are all I know about Control
[4:55:34] <T_Sasquatch> Control group
[4:55:34] <cureneckbeard> the game is called CONTROL
[4:55:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Don't I know it. 7.62x54R is oddly rare where I live.
[4:55:44] <KishinGrek> CONTROL group
[4:55:47] <+el_thag> Jessie just escaped is all
[4:55:48] <alexandrecau> one is control group the other is experimented on
[4:55:49] <arkv01> x variable and control
[4:55:52] <+SolverCODO> It's about more than just that too
[4:55:55] <%Rumbutt> The one you don't experiment on is the control, yeah
[4:55:58] <%Starlight_Gamer> why pat?
[4:56:06] <sappinmahbinyot> Any plot summary up to this point?
[4:56:07] <FalseEyeD> @el_thag They were watching her over the years.
[4:56:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger spam cans, man. Gotta go bulk for that stuff. you have a nugget?

[4:56:28] <%Teintstein> and how we are controlled by the Board
[4:56:29] <%starotter70> cha
[4:56:40] <%Teintstein> and how the altered items are controlled by the Board
[4:56:43] <+Grayhammatter> the whole adult population? monkaS
[4:56:43] <%boxedbit> Is the experiment peer reviewed?
[4:56:56] <%jobbedbone> how much do you have to use the Ctrl key while playing this
[4:56:57] <%InugamiTheHound> @FirearmsInstructor I would love to learn how to fire guns
[4:56:59] <ZE_Count> Someone interview her. Not them maybe
[4:57:03] <%grayjammer> The interviews were her therapy sessions
[4:57:04] <Mister_McDerp> no the psychiatrist interviewed her, not the bureau
[4:57:05] <+SolverCODO> I think the interview with her was under the guise of normal, unrelated therapy
[4:57:06] <%Calek> those were tapes from her therapy sessions not interview tapes
[4:57:08] <$megamonmon123> what if jessie is from another dimension
[4:57:08] <%velemi> no pat you're wrong
[4:57:09] <+JackMillerTime> do you think they decided on the ordinary town after dylan killed that guy?
[4:57:10] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Alan Wake Events
[4:57:16] <gekizenbu> GUN
[4:57:18] <%ParaSpitfire> The film is not rolling

[4:57:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Mementos*
[4:57:35] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor I sure do lol. Soviet stamped, made in 1944. Has grooves in the wood, and it took me four hours and more than 300 patches to clean the barrel.
[4:57:45] <%FirearmsInstructor> @InugamiTheHound Are you in the states? I'm sure there's a local range nearby that you can visit and will be happy to introduce you to the sport and allow you to shoot. :)

[5:00:42] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor It wasn't cosmolene. It went from black, to dark green which is the colour of oxidized copper. The barrel is mostly smooth now, with a few grooves in it. That thing got shot who knows how many times before I got.

[5:03:50] <Mister_McDerp> WutFace dung monkeys
[5:03:50] <ZE_Count> Some asshole kids took the slide.
[5:03:50] <%NeroInfinite> ew
[5:03:51] <%Teintstein> ya the whole Ordinary event is super fucked
[5:03:55] <%starotter70> ummmm
[5:03:57] <%Calek> if the Ordinary event was a video game, the Not-Mother would be the final boss
[5:03:57] <%velemi> the one that they lived through?
[5:04:01] <FalseEyeD> Big Whoops
[5:04:01] <ActualNobody6400> What is this game
[5:04:05] <ActualNobody6400> jesus
[5:04:06] <+el_thag> Dung Monkey tiddy milk
[5:04:07] <%Teintstein> went to "Temple" and met "Not Mother"
[5:04:10] <cureneckbeard> like the Threshold episode
[5:04:11] <ZE_Count> Thats a big OOPS
[5:04:13] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat you missed a file
[5:04:13] <+anarachnid> This game is "control"
[5:04:15] <+anarachnid> I am helpful
[5:04:16] <transporterthesequel> Now I do want a whole Ordinary game
[5:04:18] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat the VA's name is Sean Durrie btw
[5:04:19] <Meta_Four> Uh, could the "Temple" just be an unexplored room in The Oldest House?
[5:04:21] <FalseEyeD> This game is LORTNOC
[5:04:23] <alexandrecau> Who is casper anyway?
[5:04:23] <+SolverCODO> Oh we're gonna learn something important real soon
[5:04:33] <%Zalthia> Man that sucks what happened to Dylan
[5:04:38] <+el_thag> Casper is darling
[5:04:39] <%Calek> Darling Caspar is the head scientist of the FBC
[5:04:39] <Valdorick> Pro tip chat - if you ever start a town, names to stay away from - "Sanctuary" "Ordinary" "Nevergonnagetfuckedland"
[5:04:41] <ActualNobody6400> @anarachnid lol, you're good, It was more in disbelief than curiosity
[5:04:50] <%Zalthia> It’s really sad :(
[5:04:52] <Nyemmers> dont you hate it when you stole some pen from school and the pen summons satan at your home
[5:05:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Valdorick what about Hell, Michigan
[5:05:03] <%Teintstein> sometimes dead is better
[5:05:05] <+SolverCODO> @Valdorick "Paradise" burned to the ground a few months ago
[5:05:06] <%starotter70> ooooooh
[5:05:15] <ALazo> cute
[5:05:19] <ActualNobody6400> burn it
[5:05:21] <%velemi> real talk I wanna play the game based on the events of ordinary
[5:05:21] <FalseEyeD> 88 MPH
[5:05:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Yeah. Like I said, soviet stamped 1944. I'm pretty certain it was a WWII survivor that made it over here. That barrel is thrashed. Came with the original oil can and rope bore-cleaner. And the ammo belt. Best part was the original four-edged bayonet.
[5:05:29] <%InugamiTheHound> @Valdorick don't forget about silent hill, shepard's glenn
[5:05:30] <%Zalthia> This is scary and sad
[5:05:30] <Valdorick> Naming your city Hell is like, playing Uno Reverse on the rule.
[5:05:31] <asddsa28> why tho
[5:05:34] <%Scrub_Seeker> so the projector is just SCP 93
[5:05:35] <transporterthesequel> This is a fuckin boss arena for suuure
[5:05:38] <%flyingavocad0s> Break it
[5:05:43] <%NeroInfinite> so they simpsons movied off the whole town?
[5:05:51] <+el_thag> That would be an epic wh40k board
[5:05:52] <worldbrand> is this how you go through the final level lol
[5:05:59] <transporterthesequel> God I need an Ordinary game
[5:06:08] <%Scrub_Seeker> this is awesome because SCP 93 is like the best SCP to adapt into a game
[5:06:09] <%Teintstein> @AngriestPat the stages correspond to the files you've been reading
[5:06:13] <+SolverCODO> Fight in this COD level
[5:06:34] <sappinmahbinyot> Wait what you can fly?
[5:06:47] <Valdorick> Fly/Super Hero
[5:06:48] <jtdobyns> so the swirl door in the motel is Alan wakes realm?
[5:06:51] <Manjove> this is a cool fight arena
[5:06:52] <%Teintstein> @sappinmahbinyot yup he cleansed an object of power last stream
[5:06:52] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s falling with style
[5:06:54] <%RubberFistFight> lol is this a model city?
[5:06:58] <asurite_warrior> God damn Paige reminds me so much of my aunt.
[5:06:58] <Sphincter_Spelunker> go to the eye doctor paige
[5:06:59] <Jolnir> jesse is in a dream world as the control and the hiss are the real people diving in to stop her finding out the truth
[5:07:01] <%RubberFistFight> so this is basically a big fucking Kaiju fight
[5:07:03] <%Calek> @jtdobyns most likely the Dark Place
[5:07:06] <alexandrecau> you're a director of course you fly
[5:07:09] <%velemi> SCP 93 is the best SCP
[5:07:09] <ShichiNoBushi> The area expands exponentially in proportion to the constant rate of the radius.
[5:07:09] <sappinmahbinyot> @Teintstein I have no ideaa what that means but that sounds cool
[5:07:15] <jtdobyns> oh okay yah
[5:07:19] <asurite_warrior> Pat couldn't be more different from mu uncle though
[5:07:37] <transporterthesequel> Holy SHIT
[5:07:38] <+el_thag> All executives can fly don’t ya know
[5:07:40] <ZE_Count> this si good
[5:07:42] <+SolverCODO> I think this is the one
[5:07:43] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger I'd have to look into it more. I'm not super well versed on mosins outside of the basics, but that sounds fairly rare and unique. I'd research it more or check out forums online and share. Either way that's cool. :)
[5:07:53] <%Monkeyweed21> what does the slide projector actually do
[5:07:55] <+JustToWatch> there's more stuff in the model room
[5:07:58] <asddsa28> why is there a moc town
[5:08:09] <Arts_Shadow2> Anyone watch The Lost Room?
[5:08:11] <%Calek> that line was used in an Old Gods of Asgard song
[5:08:17] <ActualNobody6400> Love this flooring
[5:08:21] <KasiCrafter> @Arts_Shadow2 I did, actually!
[5:08:25] <$megamonmon123> alternate universe jesse?
[5:08:26] <ALazo> part of alan wakes lyrics
[5:08:29] <%Niney_Who> Niney_Who subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[5:08:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @calek which one....Poet and the Muse?
[5:08:36] <KasiCrafter> The Lost Room and everything in it is basically an SCP.
[5:08:37] <alexandrecau> she is a shitty psychiatrist
[5:08:40] <+RogueMinja> The psychiatrist is an asshole.
[5:08:40] <+el_thag> @monkeyweed21 Basically windows to other worlds ala Thresholds
[5:08:45] <%starotter70> wow
[5:08:46] <sappinmahbinyot> @el_thag I thought so too but when one of my co workers jumped out the window, disappeared and then started calling me weekly without any sign of ever living, then I figured out I was just imagining him the whole time. Huh, froggy was always a weirdo.
[5:08:47] <%MagickBurritoh> DAMN
[5:08:48] <%Deano8817> Deano8817 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! jermaJup1 jermaJup2
[5:08:48] <%Calek> @doc_ock_rokc Children of the Elder God from American Nightmare
[5:08:50] <%Deano8817> jermaJup3 jermaJup4
[5:08:51] <transporterthesequel> Oh and she happens to love it here huh
[5:09:00] <%InugamiTheHound> @ALazo his book or the song they used in the game?
[5:09:02] <Mister_McDerp> JUP
[5:09:02] <ZE_Count> Oh yeah the lost room was good.
[5:09:03] <Arts_Shadow2> It came out before SCP...
[5:09:05] <lethallylactic> The "psychiatrist" is really just a bureau interrogator fromt he sound of it.
[5:09:06] <Valdorick> The pencil that creates a penny when you tap it is the greatest thing ever, and I want it.
[5:09:08] <%Deano8817> apatHat mother fu
[5:09:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor I'm glad someone else thinks so haha. You're probably right, I should do some more research on it. I do also have an old Westernfield 12 ga.
[5:09:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Calek American nightmare had Balance slays the demon
[5:09:29] <%Calek> that's the one sorry
[5:09:31] <%NeroInfinite> combo broken deano
[5:09:34] <%Calek> I get the songs confused sometimes
[5:09:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger I'll poke around and see if I can find out anything further about it if I find the time and energy to do so. :)
[5:09:50] <ALazo> Deep within the ocean of darkness, in the mirror of light, balance becomes a stranger, And in your fantasies, he rides a storm on your peace
[5:09:50] <KasiCrafter> I think the ticket that transports you to the same place in Kansas(?) when it touches your skin is sick.
[5:09:58] <arkv01> agents man, dunno lol
[5:10:05] <%johnny_gogo> SOUNDS fucking nutz
[5:10:06] <asddsa28> ooo she know
[5:10:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh boy
[5:10:07] <%Calek> I hope they explain how Jesse knows a poem from a poet who wrote himself out of existence
[5:10:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor That'd be cool dude.
[5:10:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby sbfpSweetbaby
[5:10:27] <Jolnir> take your meds jesse schizo
[5:10:37] <transporterthesequel> Oh Polaris and this Hiss aren't connected at ALL huh:blatent sarcasm:
[5:10:43] <%Koosahmii> Hence the punch move!
[5:10:44] <%ParaSpitfire> "the government did it, you gotta believe me government agent!"
[5:10:45] <+SolverCODO> yikes
[5:10:50] <ActualNobody6400> I swear to god if this turns out to be some Shutter Island bullshit...
[5:10:55] <FalseEyeD> Big Yikes
[5:11:02] <+Grayhammatter> that's a big yikes
[5:11:10] <%starotter70> Yikes
[5:11:13] <%Ion_Laser> oof
[5:11:16] <Tucker0603> fuck....
[5:11:16] <%NeroInfinite> oh man that's ROUGH
[5:11:17] <Mister_McDerp> she totally did it
[5:11:19] <%grayjammer> Ambiguious
[5:11:27] <lethallylactic> Did the Not-Mother take them? monkaS
[5:11:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> threshold kids
[5:11:30] <%Ion_Laser> Did she wish them to a corn field?
[5:11:30] <%bevyrage> threshold kids
[5:11:34] <%grayjammer> Might've been the other kid that wanted the same thing
[5:11:34] <transporterthesequel> YEEEEEP
[5:11:36] <+SolverCODO> Ya I really do imagine the Ordinary story as being a Stranger Things situation with a bunch of kids but it goes wrong and they actually can't fix it
[5:11:36] <+JustToWatch> no
[5:11:39] <%miguelrod777> probaly
[5:11:43] <FalseEyeD> no
[5:11:51] <Bunnykinght96> Children of the corn bro
[5:11:59] <areallygoodname> Wisconsin eww
[5:12:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> You're the most SCP
[5:12:08] <%bevyrage> the town SCP is featured in the series Containment
[5:12:18] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat you missed something in the other room
[5:12:19] <%Calek> Remedy could actually do a mini live action series for Ordinary, live action is not new to them
[5:12:19] <%bevyrage> and instead of being people disappearing it was peeps dying and showing up in the town
[5:12:22] <Valdorick> Jessie has one slide... Dylan has the other?
[5:12:23] <ALazo> Pfft. Just bring over the dump.
[5:12:30] <KasiCrafter> Wait. The PHYSICAL dump???
[5:12:34] <+Fynale> like who the fuck is funding this place
[5:12:34] <ALazo> Fly it up to the office
[5:12:38] <gekizenbu> what if the psychic kids are the slides
[5:12:40] <+SolverCODO> Jesse likely DID create the slide projector. She's a powerful parautilitarian, who thought about escaping to other worlds frequently, and intentful thought is how AWE's happen in the first place
[5:12:44] <%miguelrod777> even the maggots
[5:12:45] <KasiCrafter> Freaking OoPs shenanigans.
[5:12:47] <%Razputin217> All the garbage
[5:12:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Either Jesse or Dylan is a slide I bet
[5:12:57] <ZE_Count> I think each slide had a weird alternative god beings. Doing weird shit.
[5:12:57] <alexandrecau> with an object of power
[5:12:59] <wholewheat420> JUST TAKE THE WHOLE DUMP.. AND PUSH IT OVER THERE
[5:13:02] <FalseEyeD> Anyone else getting suttering?
[5:13:02] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they had to be selling some of these lesser ones to fund this place or something
[5:13:07] <Arts_Shadow2> in dump trucks
[5:13:07] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat you missed an audio file
[5:13:09] <Valdorick> How'd they move an entire dump - answer: The Subway tunnels Kappa
[5:13:10] <cureneckbeard> jesse is dylan's stand
[5:13:14] <%WackyGear> in the first toom up there
[5:13:16] <+SolverCODO> We're gonna learn something soon that supports the idea she created it
[5:13:34] <TheMirai> stuttering
[5:13:36] <artoflec> yeah im getting a weird stuttering too, like the video is interpolating
[5:13:37] <%WackyGear> oops
[5:13:37] <%Soul_Intern> Well
[5:13:39] <+el_thag> They brought every single soiled body pillow Pat...
[5:13:39] <%bevyrage> pat, reading audio files in 2019
[5:13:40] <%Soul_Intern> He is wacky
[5:13:41] <%bevyrage> what a time to be alive
[5:13:42] <%NeroInfinite> H O W
[5:13:48] <Mister_McDerp> alan wake caused his AWE, so she probably caused hers
[5:13:51] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat how do they do that shit
[5:13:52] <%Soul_Intern> Insanity
[5:14:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @NeroInfinite Old house shit
[5:14:02] <gekizenbu> "Dump's haunted" -Darling
[5:14:02] <Valdorick> But no really, likely the magic subway tunnel that connects to the old house.
[5:14:03] <%Teintstein> @Fynale there's a file that mentions the Oldest House's ability to not be noticed expands to the Bureau's budget so the Treasury Department just gives them money without noticing
[5:14:06] <%flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat sounds like Jesse made an awe the same way Alan wake did
[5:14:06] <ActualNobody6400> That's unbelievable? THAT'S the part you don't believe?
[5:14:21] <transporterthesequel> HAUNTED DUMP
[5:14:22] <%Calek> @Mister_McDerp the dark presence started it but yeah
[5:14:25] <GuilKato> having extra-dimensional space must make it way easier to just seal off parts of your office
[5:14:28] <%Teintstein> I have haunted dumps like every other week
[5:14:29] <+Grayhammatter> that's a BIG haunted
[5:14:30] <%NeroInfinite> The dump is the origin of the HISS
[5:14:40] <TheMirai> dump's haunted "what" *loads gun and gets back into dumptruck* "dump's haunted"
[5:14:47] <ALazo> The hiss are dumpster babies
[5:14:47] <+SolverCODO> lol
[5:14:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> moons haunted is my favorite meme
[5:14:50] <+Bad1uck> @fynale it's better than that, their budget comes from the federal government but due to the Oldest House nobody notices their lines on the budget and it just gets approved
[5:14:57] <GuilKato> band from alan wake I think?
[5:15:08] <artoflec> yeah i think that was the alan wake band
[5:15:09] <%VanaSkiller> you missed too LUL
[5:15:21] <%Calek> that's the alan wake band yeah, played by the real band Poets of the Fall who also exist in this world go figure
[5:15:32] <+SolverCODO> Let you walk into them is what
[5:15:43] <%Teintstein> there's a really neat sequence with music later on
[5:15:50] <%Teintstein> music by Poets of the Fall*
[5:15:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Calek in Alan wake Poets of the fall say they were inspired by Old gods
[5:16:01] <%Soul_Intern> DE-LETED
[5:16:18] <+el_thag> Wait so are the Hiss just the ET Atari carts out for revenge?
[5:16:20] <%Calek> I love Alan Wake so much I gotta replay it leading up to the DLC
[5:16:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is it back on sale?
[5:16:40] <%Calek> I have no idea
[5:16:45] <ScatterCatt> Is the stream kinda choppy for everyone else?
[5:16:46] <cureneckbeard> WHO'S DARLING
[5:16:54] <Wan6Saber> stream is fine, chat
[5:16:54] <%Teintstein> stream's fine for me
[5:16:59] <+el_thag> Alan Wake rights got sorted out it’s back on sale
[5:17:03] <ShichiNoBushi> He's the one that implemented the things everyone is wearing on their chests?
[5:17:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> EEEUP alan wake is back online
[5:17:09] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> so THIS is where he recorded the videos!
[5:17:10] <Valdorick> … wait... was Darling using YOUR projector to record his fucked up video's? Is that why he's so off?
[5:17:21] <FalseEyeD> Stream is running fine, but the image is VERY stuttery
[5:17:39] <+SolverCODO> We're about to get to the thing! BOTH THINGS
[5:17:40] <ScatterCatt> @FalseEyeD Yeah, it's stuttery. That's what I'm talking aboutl.
[5:17:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> I guess the Thin White Duke's lawyers sorted it out quick
[5:17:42] <%Calek> @Valdorick projectors don't record, they take tiny pictures and make them bigger
[5:17:44] <gekizenbu> DUMP'S HAUNTED
[5:17:47] <%Teintstein> @Valdorick it was a slide projector, so it doesn't record anything, just projects, and the slides were special
[5:17:50] <+JackMillerTime> did this dude mike tv himself?
[5:17:51] <Tucker0603> HE WENT IN
[5:17:57] <Valdorick> OH RIGHT!
[5:17:59] <Ner234> Shit's cursed
[5:18:02] <Tucker0603> HES IN THE THERE
[5:18:10] <transporterthesequel> oh god
[5:18:12] <FalseEyeD> @AngriestPat Is the image stuttering for you?

[5:18:29] <ミュウレ4242> and immediatly used it to make anime real.
[5:18:31] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> hey question, how do we know we're not in a slide right now?

[5:32:45] <Neo_Kaiser> lol just found out that Borderlands 3 requires a constant 2mb/s DRM upload in order to run on PC
[5:32:57] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[5:32:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 32m.
[5:33:00] <%ArcanumMBD> @Neo_Kaiser lmfao what??
[5:33:01] <%Teintstein> @Neo_Kaiser lol wut why
[5:33:08] <%Calek> @Neo_Kaiser that's insane
[5:33:10] <Patzzki217> @Neo_Kaiser what
[5:33:17] <Slim_Lipid> Just refund the game and run it through the exe
[5:33:18] <+CourageTheCat> Spyware time
[5:33:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Teintstein its the DRM system
[5:33:22] <Slim_Lipid> save money
[5:33:27] <Neo_Kaiser> Someone said he couldn't stream Borderlands 3 cause it was killing his internet
[5:33:28] <+el_thag> Look up in the ceilings & edges of the top walkways
[5:33:30] <%grayjammer> Saying "Blind" while hes doing this quest is fucking so goddamn rhetorical. Like. That shits hidden man
[5:33:32] <%Teintstein> fuck that game and Randy Pitchford
[5:33:34] <%ArcanumMBD> oh my god he's right. Google Borderlands 3 DRM Upload and you'll get a reddit link
[5:33:46] <%gatoralus> thats crazy i am loving that game but fuck man
[5:33:55] <Patzzki217> FUCK US AUSTRALIANS THEN
[5:33:57] <lols_royce> the fuc?
[5:33:58] <%Monkeyweed21> did you see the rick and morty reference
[5:33:59] <%Ion_Laser> What?
[5:33:59] <%starotter70> Jeeeeeesus
[5:34:02] <%FirearmsInstructor> wtf???
[5:34:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Spyware
[5:34:04] <%velemi> thats.... insane?!
[5:34:05] <%falineth> 2MB/s???
[5:34:06] <bear_breaker20> sounds sketch
[5:34:06] <%grayjammer> Oh yucky
[5:34:07] <Valdorick> 10/10, amazing DRM
[5:34:12] <%hntronium> fuck that
[5:34:20] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's also possibly for the twitch intergration
[5:34:21] <%FirearmsInstructor> It's actually uploading your CC#'s and SSN and personal shit.
[5:34:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat too bad its probably already cracked
[5:34:28] <%NeroInfinite> IT don't matter how strong the DRM is pirates WIll find away
[5:34:30] <Tucker0603> that fucking sucks
[5:34:34] <gekizenbu> its gonna get cracked out of necessity
[5:34:35] <ミュウレ4242> and people pirate it anyway.
[5:34:35] <lionmanguy> And here's beating it's a week tops before it's cracked anyways
[5:34:39] <noobpsyboticus> it uploads your homemade porn
[5:34:39] <%nmaten> always online drm doesnt stop pirates tho it just fucks over the people that pay for it
[5:34:39] <ALazo> Yet another reason to not get the game. Amazing.
[5:34:45] <LixFury> to the point where people with bad internet cant play online because of it
[5:34:46] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah because always-online DRM has never been circumvented before Kappa
[5:34:46] <%Teintstein> it's just sending all your data to Randy Pitchford
[5:34:51] <%aeravon> Cho dropped a pouch you might need for the quest?
[5:34:54] <%Kiiper> I mean, I'm running it right now and It's only using less then a KB/s
[5:34:57] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat bl3 has the vermintide thing where twitch chat can make it harder and stuff for you
[5:35:02] <asddsa28> is it doing well now?
[5:35:03] <%Calek> 1 and 2 were so neat though
[5:35:03] <%gatoralus> the game itself is really good though
[5:35:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @nmaten that is why Steam has been so effective. its DRM that people like because it isn't made by dicks
[5:35:14] <Owlboy7> FeelsBadMan
[5:35:15] <veldinmusic> Yea i wish randy would just fuck off
[5:35:17] <Arts_Shadow2> they had one job
[5:35:18] <ShichiNoBushi> Goons sent directly to your house.
[5:35:19] <%Meekest> Borderlands 3 is like Death By A Thousand Cuts in terms of interest
[5:35:22] <%Teintstein> did you watch Jim's video on the review process as well?
[5:35:22] <FalseEyeD> Borderlands is the definition of overhyped franchise
[5:35:22] <sappinmahbinyot> God I hate Randy
[5:35:28] <%RubberFistFight> What a bunch of fucking muppets, seriously. Doing that kind of shit ENSURES that people WILL pirate it at rates they wouldn't have if it wasn't implemented in the first place.
[5:35:34] <ZE_Count> Did you ever hear about that infinite ammo mod?
[5:35:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> I lost all intrest when 2k ruined that superfan's career
[5:35:40] <sappinmahbinyot> Gearbox is so good at fucking over their devs.
[5:35:42] <%RubberFistFight> fucking self-fulfilling prophecy so Randy the Tosspot can play victim.
[5:35:45] <sappinmahbinyot> And screwing up PR.
[5:35:47] <%Kiiper> This is all big lies lmao
[5:35:47] <+el_thag> That’s Magic Pitchford for ya
[5:35:50] <%velemi> ALLEGEDLY
[5:35:54] <sappinmahbinyot> But it's surprising that 75% of that is pitchford alone
[5:35:56] <LixFury> They made it so the pirated version will be the better version LUL
[5:35:57] <Slim_Lipid> "allegedly"
[5:35:58] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat we can blame it all on good ol honest randy and goon loving 2k
[5:35:58] <+CourageTheCat> A L L E G E DDL Y
[5:36:00] <%NeroInfinite> Steam DRM is good since it doesn't fuck over the paying people
[5:36:01] <%Ion_Laser> allegedly...
[5:36:02] <sappinmahbinyot> He's really a toxic person.
[5:36:04] <ZE_Count> I never got this
[5:36:06] <+SolverCODO> I never got this :O
[5:36:07] <%Kiiper> I'm all for talking the shit out of Gearbox and Randy
[5:36:08] <%Zalthia> I just don’t care about it. When it was announced I was so excited but now I just don’t care, and I’m not even sure why
[5:36:10] <noobpsyboticus> more like Randy pitchfork

[5:41:44] <%RubberFistFight> @Soul_Intern head mod conspired with a mod of a circlejerk subreddit (who hated freefolk and wanted to destroy it) to pull a "positivity week" thing and ban swearing. They then used the drama that generated to justify setting the sub to private. When it came back, they had demodded and banned all the other mods. The reddit ADMINS had to step in and do a 24 hour rollback as well as removal of the conspirator and head mod's permissions - but the new mod list contains confirmed alts of them.
