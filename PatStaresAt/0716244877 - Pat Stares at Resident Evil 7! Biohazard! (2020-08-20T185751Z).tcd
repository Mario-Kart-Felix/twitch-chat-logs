[0:30:10] <%saiyan24675> @evbites agreed
[0:30:13] <%Agami23> oh. if pats interested in it, its probably a fate character action game
[0:30:13] <Futurecity10> Oh boy, I can’t wait to see saber raped in a new way
[0:30:25] <%rissaleigh14> Puppy needs his quality of life
[0:30:27] <jeffishype> Hope you splurged
[0:30:35] <%weissguard> Future, you good?
[0:30:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Dust my wets.
[0:30:43] <%saiyan24675> Don’t let puppy drink from toilet
[0:30:46] <+evbites> also to watch gigguk die
[0:30:52] <%crimsonharvest> its star wars so nothing matters
[0:30:53] <%CzeekyPlays> "Oh please, Mr. Wets is my father's name. Please call me Sharts."
[0:31:00] <fairore> @weissguard talking about fate
[0:31:00] <Futurecity10> @weissguard I’m actually referencing something from the series
[0:31:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> yup same FeelsBadMan
[0:31:24] <%Meidolaon> Something that hasn't happened since the original game
[0:31:24] <%asgard147> They ain't too bad
[0:31:26] <%Meidolaon> Thanks Medea
[0:31:28] <%weissguard> I get that, but you've mentioned it a couple of times now. It's a little offputting.
[0:31:33] <%Solid_Stro> I’m a good Jedi, which means I’ll hate you if you do anything less than good. psaPat
[0:31:40] <KeiPrime> damn re7 got really scarey
[0:31:43] <Futurecity10> Yeah it is isn’t it?
[0:32:01] <%Garthunox> Pat have you watched Hbomberguys RWBY video? even if you're not a fan it's a really good watch
[0:32:05] <%crimsonharvest> in the case of 1.0 survivors, literally isekais
[0:32:13] <%asgard147> yeah, that's really hard to do
[0:32:14] <%Jonesman64> "Loli Ho!" "What did you call me?"
[0:32:21] <%Meidolaon> @weissguard Especially with the fixation on something that happened once and then was never brought up again
[0:32:21] <%mikessdd> yeah WOL is like the same character by the end more or less. They give you a lot more predetermined back story than you'd normally see
[0:32:25] <%Agami23> i just got to the part where the main character sees a tomestone and looks like they are going to fucking dye
[0:32:46] <JesterEgbert> pat are you gonna play any RE7 mods? like 3rd person or family guy?
[0:33:01] <%NeoCre> Referencing Lonesome Road? Now I’m interested
[0:33:22] <fairore> got I want to ff 14 train so bad I'm so jealous of all you
[0:33:33] <+IndieSpenceable> I would have went back to FFXIV but I chose WoW instead, big mistake?
[0:33:39] <+chase959> what is this discussion about?
[0:33:44] <Futurecity10> I not remember that scene from 5.0
[0:33:46] <+chase959> what happened
[0:33:56] <BlackOrchidKI> @fairore Same. This game's story is interesting me more and more
[0:34:02] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Clown Shit
[0:34:07] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Is way more fun to watch
[0:34:25] <%Garthunox> Pat have you watched Hbomberguys RWBY video? even if you're not a fan it's a really good watch
[0:34:26] <Futurecity10> Yo that new hololive clown girl though
[0:34:28] <%bassoontyphoon> Im in Montreal too, I agree that I wish more people wore them
[0:34:31] <%asgard147> We need some clown shit Pat, things are kinda bad FeelsBadMan
[0:34:32] <%mikessdd> WoW is a very different game in terms of feel etc. You'd play them for completely different reasons
[0:34:35] <%BinaryFireball> still super dangerous
[0:34:39] <DrkJP520> Nobody wares one in Sweden. I feel like the 0.1%
[0:34:43] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I wear my mask in the shower
[0:34:43] <%patriotrenegade> WEAR YOUR MASK IN PUBLIC PLACES
[0:34:46] <Huntercd> Does Zangief have a mask?
[0:34:47] <%afronooch> i gotta sick cactaur mask, i wear it for the drip tbh
[0:34:49] <%marsantas> Low isn't ZERO
[0:34:49] <+evbites> BuT PuPpY - idoits
[0:34:50] <+IMCthulhu> @PatStaresAt its 120f out here some days, people are barely walking outside, i can put my mask on before going in the store
[0:34:52] <nauskills> People in Montreal's Metros take out their masks often, it's the fuckin worst
[0:34:53] <%rissaleigh14> I can see that being a serious issue in heavily populated areas
[0:34:55] <rytisone> the last time I put the mask, I ended up dancing with Tina in a Coco Bong club
[0:34:58] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> 1. Don't Panic. 2. Don't Be Stupid
[0:34:59] <SummonerMagno> no mask no pet dog
[0:35:04] <%TheGreatSkenardo> @Futurecity10 what hololive clown girl
[0:35:18] <%Solid_Stro> Internet Historian’s video about toilet paper is hilarious doodLUL
[0:35:20] <CapOfAllFools> Yup! The complacency is frustrating, especially here in Georgia, which is now the number 1 state in the U.S. to be exposed to Covid. FML.
[0:35:20] <%mikessdd> Well shit i guess it's good they have the car now
[0:35:24] <NeuFK> Keep in mind that to be infected you need a viral charge big enough to be infected.
[0:35:27] <Aydarkzero> same
[0:35:27] <%toolofparanoia> I see people wearing their mask in their car and im like do they share the car? Are they an uber? If not they are just fucking stupid.
[0:35:31] <%bassoontyphoon> Unfortuntely I need to take the bus to get to the Hospital
[0:35:34] <%bigdumbidiotguy> coronavirus itself drives the bus
[0:35:34] <%asgard147> Good call
[0:35:37] <%BinaryFireball> the worst place ever
[0:35:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Heroin?
[0:35:43] <%rissaleigh14> If I didn't have a car I would not have left the house since this all began
[0:35:53] <NeuFK> Honestly I subscribed to bixi to avoid the metro
[0:35:56] <%rissaleigh14> Because I do not trust public transport
[0:36:09] <%afronooch> @bigdumbidiotguy covid gotta pay rent too
[0:36:10] <%bassoontyphoon> @NeuFK Thats a good idea, how pricey is it?
[0:36:10] <Huntercd> Inb4 Last of Us
[0:36:14] <%cowardman93> the london underground is severely overcrowded cause of less trains in usage so covid cases are gonna skyrocket because of it
[0:36:20] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I have Moronavirus
[0:36:23] <+ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[0:36:29] <NeuFK> @bassoontyphoon like 100 a year or something

[0:36:39] <@SoFarFetched> hon hon hon
[0:36:41] <%toolofparanoia> I have rode the metro. You are required to wear a mask on it and people do.... but not always right, ie the mask not covering their FUCKING NOSE

[0:38:56] <%bigdumbidiotguy> can you start the game over? I missed the beginning
[0:39:17] <%Skelegroove> I hate when they put a bunch of items immediately after an item box. Makes you rearrange your inventory twice

[0:58:40] <+evbites> no
[0:58:40] <Aydarkzero> no
[0:58:40] <%ScottishMadJacko> @BallerSwagBro9k It is over a few years so maybe that helps
[0:58:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BallerSwagBro9k actually over a 3 year period it would be rather normal
[0:58:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> sadly
[0:58:46] <KeiPrime> this is the main game
[0:58:48] <+RyTYoung> But it's a good machine gun tho
[0:58:51] <lazypointer> Or is this Chris?
[0:58:55] <+RyTYoung> too bad it comes into the game too late

[0:59:01] <%honeyman18> eww that pop is stanky man
[0:59:03] <dukenux> @BallerSwagBro9k i like to think Rusty from LA Noire was delegated to the investigation "eh, they drowned in bayou. case cloded"
[0:59:05] <Aydarkzero> this is the main game story
[0:59:07] <lazypointer> I thought he'd have finished yesterday
[0:59:08] <gade177> It's the main story.

[1:00:44] <+xeros720> yeah, they can't climb ladders and then you go through this "load crevice"
[1:00:48] <PiotrRasputin> It's true. Evelyn is a cut scene "encounter".
[1:00:53] <lazypointer> WIND PAT, WIND IS THE LAST BOSS
[1:00:55] <+xeros720> or is it a "load shimmy"
[1:00:55] <NeoseekerStitch> Find it kinda weird that the wall that ou enter to get in the basement is now just open and blocked by wood, but in the beginning, it's wood against a solid wall.
[1:00:56] <%gespenst25> t90GG WP
[1:00:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> she is more of a cutscene fight
[1:00:57] <+RyTYoung> This game is still great

[1:01:19] <pineapplepervert> There's no final boss, grandma is a victory lap.

[1:03:22] <thefunkiestpunkiest> Ethan simping for his bio terrorist gf cost him a hand and a foot
[1:03:26] <DrivenDust> backseating BabyRage
[1:03:28] <%penitentpentwitch> Now that I think about it, Ethan is still infected when the game ends
[1:03:36] <dukenux> yes, he a simp, because he didn't give cure to Zoe Kappa

[1:03:59] <DrivenDust> Jeeezus
[1:04:02] <rosemon5001> @dukenux rbzSmrt
[1:04:04] <%penitentpentwitch> It may be why Chris uses him for RE8. He still has super healing powers.
[1:04:05] <%Skelegroove> RE8 infection could be a mutation of the mold

[1:08:20] <brambobelurkin> ahh

[1:11:05] <Talfri> Chris has a hard time looking like Chris
[1:11:06] <lazypointer> He looks like Nathan Drake
[1:11:07] <BlkFlameKami> HE IS FAKE THO
[1:11:09] <+gustavozxd> people still think that
[1:11:10] <SirKeigan> IF they didn't take so long there would be no game
[1:11:12] <oligobear> continue the redfield bloodline
[1:11:12] <+amaranthos> i wonder if ethan's limbs just fall off if he gets cured
[1:11:13] <Sapphire_Breeze> it still can be
[1:11:14] <pineapplepervert> Deflated Chris
[1:11:14] <Aydarkzero> Mia elaYIKES
[1:11:14] <%maskofmichael> It's not a fake Chris?
[1:11:16] <reavingd00m> did they ever explain why Zoe wasn't being mind controlled? Is it because Evie has no place for her in her family?
[1:11:16] <+evbites> also blue umbella makes no sense
[1:11:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> AND THEN HE ROIDED UP FOR 8
[1:11:19] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> ugh, push er out
[1:11:19] <Forticon> well that and he showed up in an Umbrella helicopter lol
[1:11:22] <ThunderRemix8> pay your face actors people!
[1:11:23] <+DeRedBaron> read the chat people been saying the moment he showed up before you said that lolol
[1:11:25] <brambobelurkin> "Hey Ethan wanna come home and fuck my sister? That was a huge monster, you are truly a worthy successor of the Redfield line."
[1:11:25] <%TheGreatSkenardo> so much for your hot sister though
[1:11:26] <Hanyusha> Chris in the 8 trailer looks super different
[1:11:27] <%Shockrates20XX> His face is just way taller and skinner.
[1:11:27] <%MidnightBurst12> now push her out the door
[1:11:28] <%AncelDeLambert> wait she's alive... we must fix this
[1:11:29] <%logoth_> Mia, not a Zoey
[1:11:30] <NeoseekerStitch> That's what a get for Scanning a real person in for the model. :P
[1:11:32] <Gallhint> he's blue umbrella's Chris Redfield TM
[1:11:33] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> yay we saved her this will totally not be invalidated in the next game
[1:11:33] <%cowardlord> Now off to life in prison for her
[1:11:34] <+Shiso666> southern girl should have been canon
[1:11:34] <illtima> And then they made him look like old Chris in RE8
[1:11:34] <auraofdawn> Thanks not!Chris!
[1:11:35] <%penitentpentwitch> That "took you so long" line really sells the idea Ethan is an agent of some kind.
[1:11:36] <%toolofparanoia> HE LOOKS MORE LIKE WESKER THAN HE DOES CHRIS
[1:11:38] <DrkJP520> They stopped making characters look like super models
[1:11:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Doesnt matter now. Hes back to normal in 8 LUL
[1:11:39] <ShichiNoBushi> They could reveal that RE7 and RE8 Chris is an impostor in 8.
[1:11:41] <%ClutchRoadagain> They made it until 8
[1:11:41] <SirKeigan> WHO SAYS THAT
[1:11:43] <%jiin6> Just ol Capcom messing with the model again
[1:11:43] <rytisone> where's Lucas, what happened to Zoe? I gues theyy went to DLCland
[1:11:45] <SirKeigan> I'LL FIGHT THEM
[1:11:45] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> what a story ethan
[1:11:48] <Dannzzyy> Chris has had some hard times since re1.
[1:11:51] <wibbwobbler> every chris looks so different from one another, other than 5 to 6
[1:11:52] <SpaceGuntank> the ending is so cheesy lol
[1:11:53] <Huntercd> WAP saved

[1:12:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> don't you just turn into goop if you run away
[1:12:12] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah that's why she just stayed in that trailer while the rest of the family stayed inside.
[1:12:13] <+unclekulikov> why is chris working for umbrella
[1:12:13] <%DappercatEsquire> BIOTERRORISM
[1:12:15] <%ClutchRoadagain> This speech is a big fat lie
[1:12:16] <%AncelDeLambert> I wonder if Chris will ask Mia to be a surrogate mother for THE REDFIELD LINE!!
[1:12:18] <%penitentpentwitch> She didn't sleep in the house, so she wasn't as close at all times

[1:17:33] <+DeRedBaron> oh yeah like my house is a little like that when i was younger
[1:17:35] <%DensityD> bear in the big blue house
[1:17:35] <%DappercatEsquire> People shrink from the wealth they inherited
[1:17:36] <DrivenDust> Mold everywhere CmonBruh
[1:17:37] <+ConLin_Arts_> old family home
[1:17:37] <blackbaron98> it;s a family house, been passed down
[1:17:37] <%Piemono> it's family house that's been there forever
[1:17:43] <%maskofmichael> It's middle class
[1:17:44] <+Shacklebox> poverty dirty not monster ditty
[1:17:45] <Phoenon> Back when he could enter the safe room, good times
[1:17:45] <%ScottishMadJacko> there is a hurricane to be fair
[1:17:45] <%BinaryFireball> making new assets is expensive
[1:17:46] <%blaccbird914> This is so depressing
[1:17:52] <chaumiester> I've seen a couple houses like his IRL. They old houses
[1:17:53] <+spaghetti_shaman> The house houses the residents......of evil
[1:17:54] <brambobelurkin> old bayou house. Cheap houses in the South look like that.
[1:17:54] <%phytopath> old money was used up....
[1:17:57] <gade177> @Divantae I think that's just because they don't know exactly how fucked up Lucas really is.
[1:17:57] <+Shacklebox> no that's just the south
[1:17:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt its what a lot of houses were like at a certian point
[1:17:58] <oniwahoo> It's probably been in the family for generations
[1:17:59] <+gustavozxd> family (family, family) house
[1:18:03] <fairore> it makes me so sad
[1:18:04] <rytisone> maintaining such a big house must be difficult
[1:18:05] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> That's rural America
[1:18:05] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt So basically in swamp lands big plantation homes like this are owned by poor people because they basically can't be maintained and are constantly filled with mold and are falling apart.
[1:18:07] <%blaccbird914> All I can think of is my grandparents and their house and I get sad
[1:18:08] <$floralkami> @divantae Lucas wasn't an overt psychopath before he got his mold powers.
[1:18:10] <SpiritsRiseR2> either clean the floor or get a dark carpet
[1:18:11] <%toolofparanoia> the house is weathered because bayou
[1:18:11] <+Shacklebox> cheap house in the south, probably inherited
[1:18:13] <%Shockrates20XX> Back in Boomer days even blue collar workers could afford a hosue like this.
[1:18:14] <Divantae> Louisiana is in a constant apocalypse they're trying their best
[1:18:15] <%DensityD> it houses the evil biohazard
[1:18:19] <+evbites> gdo they sill have a morgue
[1:18:21] <%mikessdd> yeah it's an old family house. like nobody has paid a mortgage on it since like the 40s or something
[1:18:23] <+lordericter> the batroom doesn't look like Paige's food

[1:19:15] <%weissguard> Ugh, she inked.
[1:19:19] <%ClutchRoadagain> Lucas is a fan of American Football confirmed
[1:19:21] <oniwahoo> How dirty do you have to be to turn a bed black just from laying in it for a minute
[1:19:22] <+gustavozxd> this is where a water bender would be useful
[1:19:30] <+not_draven> the word daddy is a bit weirdchamp
[1:19:32] <+spaghetti_shaman> How can a cripple run that fast?
[1:19:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> tiny child legs
[1:19:34] <SpiritsRiseR2> she's stealing your rare cards pat STOP HER
[1:19:36] <$floralkami> @divantae they took him to the doctor cause they thought he was autistic (him bring an idiot savant). they didn't know he killed someone.
[1:19:38] <%Deft_Thought> I've been playing a lot of Iceborne over the past four months. Just now getting into the Iceborne content and man, the Elder Dragon remixes are just frustrating. Not enjoying Blackveil Vaal Hazak at all.
[1:19:38] <+AcrutaLao> Oh no Lucas died
[1:19:40] <%xcompleasedad> WHERE IS THE LIGHTER
[1:19:42] <DrivenDust> She ain't gonna question that little kid going all Babadook? Okay I guess monkaS
[1:19:46] <TomFrancis_> lucas got beat up by a little girl LUL
[1:19:47] <PiotrRasputin> He's faking.

[1:20:30] <illtima> Man, Evie took control in SECONDS
[1:20:33] <oniwahoo> Is it just me or is the angle of his head and neck kind of unnatural, like a snapped neck?
[1:20:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I could see Nico from DMC as a weird neighbour living down the road
[1:20:36] <%Skelegroove> This section is weird because it shows them get infected almost instantly
[1:20:39] <+ConLin_Arts_> well, not his super mold form
[1:20:40] <Divantae> Lucas has like a meth lab yo
[1:20:43] <Phoenon> He just has different shades of shit
[1:20:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Capcom needed to look at how a zippo flame forms more than not at all
[1:20:46] <+spaghetti_shaman> They own cats I bet
[1:20:48] <%DensityD> SMOrc
[1:20:52] <%mikessdd> moldy mold spores

[1:21:19] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit Ev is just orcs
[1:21:20] <$floralkami> @skelegroove it did take like only 2-5 minutes during the tests, so bruh. plus, it's airborne
[1:21:21] <wibbwobbler> so was etan infected?
[1:21:21] <%weissguard> LUL

[1:21:30] <%AncelDeLambert> ZUG ZUG!
[1:21:31] <%NopeBadguy> everyone except Ethan and Mia apparently
[1:21:32] <SainEdge> monkaS
[1:21:34] <Tooniearcade> Woooooooo
[1:21:35] <%Mr_Pylon> but why bugs?!
[1:21:35] <+not_draven> i dont like how nebulous evie's powers are
[1:21:37] <chaumiester> Isn't Lucas just ridiculous smart
[1:21:38] <rytisone> BUGSNAX
[1:21:38] <GoldenColts> mama no
[1:21:41] <DrivenDust> monkaS
[1:21:41] <%patriotrenegade> Pats stepbrother isn’t that smart
[1:21:48] <%penitentpentwitch> But why bugs though?
[1:21:49] <$floralkami> @patstaresat isn't your brother pretty dumb?
[1:21:51] <+AcrutaLao> Go to horny jail.
[1:21:51] <%maenos2> so did she just like...shove bugs down her gullet in the last like ten minutes?
[1:21:52] <%UvBenServed> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:21:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Jack is such a bro
[1:21:55] <%Typhaeon> Kinda mom and kinda snack
[1:21:56] <%AncelDeLambert> this happens SO DAMN FAST
[1:21:56] <%penitentpentwitch> That has little to do with mold
[1:21:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> Jack BibleThump
[1:22:00] <+spaghetti_shaman> The dad is one of the best RE characters
[1:22:00] <Phoenon> Jack was such a good guy
[1:22:01] <DrivenDust> No thanks monkaS
[1:22:02] <LordOfThePoultry> WutFace
[1:22:03] <Aydarkzero> Jack really tried FeelsBadMan
[1:22:04] <TheHylianGuard> He took that awfully well
[1:22:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Jack is hero BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:22:07] <+Aworie> shame they were an ok family until all of this happened.
[1:22:08] <+amaranthos> how did she find that many bugs that quickly
[1:22:10] <%DensityD> a class 3 felony going to horny jail
[1:22:11] <black_pariah> she became a living hive in like 7 minutes
[1:22:13] <NeoseekerStitch> Man, I love Ma Baker's actress performence. :3
[1:22:15] <%Skelegroove> @floralkami RE always showed injections as much faster. It's more of how did Ethan manage to do anything
[1:22:16] <oniwahoo> Yeah
[1:22:17] <@SoFarFetched> I assume Marguarite had the weaker mentality and was taken over first is why.
[1:22:18] <%weissguard> Dire, even.
[1:22:22] <%mikessdd> well he was a marine
[1:22:22] <KeiPrime> like it aint the first time
[1:22:25] <Talfri> Maybe the older the victim, the faster and stronger the mind control
[1:22:26] <GoldenColts> daddy always knows what to do FeelsBadMan
[1:22:26] <KeiPrime> he had to tie her up
[1:22:28] <+azure22900> Jacks so good
[1:22:29] <Grandfather_Nurgle333> jack gonna have some fun with marguarite
[1:22:30] <%Loinclothiclese> yea he was a marine so makes sense
[1:22:30] <%mikessdd> Exactly
[1:22:33] <%za7az> Yeah
[1:22:34] <LorcaNomad> Jack is just the best
[1:22:35] <DrivenDust> Jack PepeHands
[1:22:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Jack was totally an RE protagonist who had sex
[1:22:41] <Talfri> Mia, Zoe, and Ethan weren't mind controlled so quickly
[1:22:47] <+ConLin_Arts_> I love my daddy
[1:22:52] <Huntercd> How did she get bugs?
[1:22:54] <%DensityD> mmm, delicious centipede vomit
[1:22:59] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> ....Only then
[1:22:59] <smuggleruncle> this stream is just a box match waiting room
[1:23:00] <%maskofmichael> That'll hold up court
[1:23:01] <%penitentpentwitch> Normal Person: "This looks like grounds for a divorce."
[1:23:03] <benjiFG> blurblurblurbrlubrlub
[1:23:04] <TheHylianGuard> Attacking is bad, but the centipedes take it over the line
[1:23:07] <illtima> Did mold turn into centipedes??
[1:23:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> FeelsBadMan
[1:23:09] <DrivenDust> beat da living shit out of your wife LULW
[1:23:13] <%mikessdd> welp he's gone
[1:23:16] <brambobelurkin> Jack and Uncle Joe are the best
[1:23:19] <%AncelDeLambert> SO FAST
[1:23:19] <%za7az> Jesus
[1:23:21] <SpaceGuntank> japan really loves their evil centipede allegory
[1:23:24] <ThunderRemix8> such a good line
[1:23:28] <+gustavozxd> FeelsBadMan
[1:23:33] <%asgard147> limesS monkaS
[1:23:40] <+AcrutaLao> But she got the rope
[1:23:44] <+RyTYoung> oh no
[1:23:47] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> my problem with this dlc is just how FAST this happens...it's so jarring
[1:23:50] <%mikessdd> I wonder if there's a difference in potency when she's young vs being old as shit
[1:23:50] <rytisone> no youre not
[1:23:51] <+RyTYoung> but daddy why
[1:23:53] <KeiPrime> centipedes are inherently evil, just look at them
[1:23:54] <@SoFarFetched> Zoe BibleThump
[1:23:57] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I think we know what's gotten into him... a knife.
[1:23:59] <%DappercatEsquire> TIME TO JUKE
[1:23:59] <%bassoontyphoon> daddeh no
[1:24:00] <DrivenDust> monkaS
[1:24:06] <SainEdge> yep LUL
[1:24:10] <+RyTYoung> BUT WE DID GET ROPE
[1:24:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The only cure for zombification in Japan is preforming a wrestling finishing move
[1:24:15] <chaumiester> So, Evie just controls them right? Why are they super insane now? Does mold make you crazy?
[1:24:18] <+ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[1:24:25] <%NopeBadguy> welcome to the family daughter
[1:24:27] <+spaghetti_shaman> So does Jack wear the same shirt every day?
[1:24:34] <Grandfather_Nurgle333> game over
[1:24:37] <%Totally_Not_Toby> cause it's scary
[1:24:49] <GoldenColts> its his trusty swamp shirt
[1:24:49] <%Bailey__gaming> why is evie actually evil tho?
[1:24:51] <+evbites> it's like forceing id
[1:24:51] <illtima> It would be cooler if had to spend a few days, slowly realizing that Evie is corrupting everyone
[1:24:52] <%DensityD> zoe gives you religious epiphanies
[1:24:53] <brachydios777> Jack got fucked
[1:24:54] <%afronooch> PULL MY CRAZY TRIGGER
[1:24:54] <%Bailey__gaming> what causes it?
[1:24:56] <AFlyingTaco1> @chaumiester The mold drives them insane, but it comes from Evie
[1:24:57] <%penitentpentwitch> Pumpin' that adrenaline button
[1:25:04] <%DensityD> ROPE
[1:25:06] <%DensityD> LUL
[1:25:09] <$floralkami> @skelegroove yeah, but before 6 (which also has the airborne, instantaneous virus), they never had an airborne pathogen, and the virus needed to be transferred through fluid contact.
[1:25:09] <blackbaron98> everyone has a crazy button
[1:25:10] <+RyTYoung> Because "Family"
[1:25:12] <%MelBrooksKA> Iindirect mind control
[1:25:14] <rosemon5001> she is a limited range 5g sith tower @PatStaresAt
[1:25:17] <%maskofmichael> It's more like a hard suggestion
[1:25:17] <Divantae> Jack still retains some of his personality along with the other infectees so it's not control
[1:25:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> There is a document in the game that shows that first she drives them mad as she learns how to control them
[1:25:22] <%AncelDeLambert> anger short-circuits the brain
[1:25:26] <%rissaleigh14> she said they were hers now and they are
[1:25:27] <wibbwobbler> they're like trapped in their minds?
[1:25:31] <shruke> So was EV always evil or?
[1:25:32] <%NopeBadguy> there are types of irl parasites that are able to exert control over their host.
[1:25:33] <rusho> @chaumiester The mold attaches to their nervous system, then Evie is able to manipulate them as pat just described.
[1:25:34] <+DeRedBaron> he said something about needing to show his devotion and "if you're under my roof then you'll do as i tell you" which kinda might be his personality but hyped up to 50
[1:25:38] <%rissaleigh14> it was just that simple
[1:25:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Would you kindly stick a shovel in that cop
[1:25:47] <%DensityD> title drop
[1:25:53] <%penitentpentwitch> She is the smol ebil
[1:25:54] <+gustavozxd> THE NAME OF THE THING
[1:25:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> Biohazard 7
[1:25:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> You said it!!!
[1:25:56] <%M4T1A5> bad parenting
[1:25:56] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> it's all she ever knew
[1:25:56] <DrivenDust> WHEN I ASK FOR ROPE I EXPECT TO GET ROPE SwiftRage SwiftRage
[1:25:57] <rytisone> nah go past that
[1:25:59] <+RyTYoung> @shruke Yes, she was designed to be like this
[1:26:01] <TheHylianGuard> I was going to ask why she was evil, but I remembered that she's a child. All children are evil
[1:26:03] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> they made her that way
[1:26:03] <Grandfather_Nurgle333> Evie just wants a family bro
[1:26:07] <chaumiester> So just learned Evil or born evil?
[1:26:07] <Aydarkzero> Lucas LUL
[1:26:10] <+gustavozxd> lmao lucas

[1:26:51] <$floralkami> @skelegroove with people constantly guessing that Ethan is a Wesker kid, that may have something to do with it (also why he's relatively unphased by Umbrella's arrival

[1:28:28] <+gustavozxd> "but knowing his half assed approach to thing" the tutorial says LUL
[1:28:34] <%miguelrod777> that's a long time
[1:28:43] <Forticon> his laptop is in the attic i think
[1:28:45] <+not_draven> are the bugs hallucinations?
[1:28:45] <+amaranthos> the weirdest part is her becoming a literal bug hive in minutes
[1:28:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> His laptop is in a secure place, thanks to Nord VPN
[1:28:49] <KeiPrime> what good's a bioweapon that dont work fast
[1:28:50] <%penitentpentwitch> Still don't know why it manifested as bugs though
[1:28:56] <+amaranthos> you'd think it'd take time to get all those centipedes
[1:28:57] <BallerSwagBro9k> WAT NO ONE PUNCH MAN?
[1:28:57] <$floralkami> @skelegroove we probably will, with Chris acting "different" than what Ethan expects.
[1:29:03] <%DappercatEsquire> what's the time elapsed between Evie infecting the family and Ethan showing up?
[1:29:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea they kinda "retcon" them slowly turning for this dlc
[1:29:05] <rytisone> do you have dog heads?
[1:29:07] <Talfri> I think the older characters get "turned" more quickly
[1:29:09] <+spaghetti_shaman> F
[1:29:10] <%AncelDeLambert> not even the most virulent disease replicates this fast
[1:29:12] <+AcrutaLao> Imagine making a bioweapon only to lose control of it and they go on a rampage killing everybody around them.
[1:29:13] <%rissaleigh14> she's so fast
[1:29:16] <+lordericter> yeah Marguirite's transformation into a living hive was pretty drastic

[1:29:25] <%penitentpentwitch> It looks like the lighter being off did help
[1:29:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DappercatEsquire 3 years atleast?
[1:29:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @dappercatesquire i think 2 years
[1:29:32] <brambobelurkin> @DappercatEsquire I believe Ethan shows up 6 months later
[1:29:35] <SleepyMaribo> @DappercatEsquire a couple of months
[1:29:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo her command grab has bullshit range
[1:29:43] <%Totally_Not_Toby> well shit

[1:29:55] <+The_Protagonist> PAT THE FRONT DOOR WAS OPEN
[1:29:56] <SainEdge> yeah but i think it isnt full time at this moment, only during certain times. The full time control takes longer

[1:30:45] <+The_Protagonist> is that not an open door right in front of your face?
[1:30:49] <brambobelurkin> @DappercatEsquire Just checked wiki Ethan is 3 years later, some of the other guys were right with 3 years
[1:30:50] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> I think he's already on the path with the bad ending since he didn't look at Lucas's stuff from the start...idk though
[1:30:51] <%Totally_Not_Toby> the light!

[1:31:01] <SainEdge> @PatStaresAt do you want to know how to get the good ending?
[1:31:03] <NeoseekerStitch> is there a way to turn the light off?

[1:46:57] <mark_collins45> Baptise the sin away!
[1:47:00] <DrivenDust> @doc_ock_rokc facts
[1:47:03] <BallerSwagBro9k> Centipedes are the worst. Worse than spiders
[1:47:09] <@SoFarFetched> the fact that he easily sliced through his ribchage
[1:47:11] <shruke> dad strength
[1:47:12] <@SoFarFetched> ribcage*
[1:47:17] <spongeofmystery> how the fuck is cutting through his ribs?
[1:47:18] <WomboWookie> I only played this once but I don’t remember this part at all
[1:47:22] <brambobelurkin> @benjiFG I never realized that lol
[1:47:22] <%toolofparanoia> spiders are great
[1:47:27] <AFlyingTaco1> B I O H A Z A R D
[1:47:27] <AdmiralButtloaf> he cut through his own sternum with a kitchen knife
[1:47:30] <SirKeigan> DEEp
[1:47:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> GIB ROPE
[1:47:32] <brachydios777> Eve made Jack so strong
[1:47:37] <%Shadicara> Bio curse activate
[1:47:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> This game did wonders for my bug fetish
[1:47:38] <SirKeigan> Yea, that's his rib cage, impossible
[1:47:40] <Talfri> Mia did toss Ethan up some stairs and through a wall
[1:47:45] <TheHylianGuard> don't be such a baby, ribs grow back, zoey!
[1:47:51] <WomboWookie> Is this a dlc
[1:47:51] <%rissaleigh14> i'm surprised the door is actually stalling him
[1:47:51] <+lordericter> precious antique fork
[1:47:52] <+amaranthos> redbox
[1:47:54] <+unclekulikov> sharp knife
[1:47:54] <Phoenon> He truly was the Evil Resident
[1:47:56] <PiotrRasputin> The Wolverine healing factor does wonders for Jack.
[1:47:56] <fairore> @talfri yep
[1:47:56] <Talfri> screw steroids, just take some Mold
[1:47:58] <AdmiralButtloaf> the knife would break tho
[1:47:58] <%Skelegroove> Or very weak bones
[1:47:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Reminds me of when Joel took me camping that one time
[1:47:58] <chll0ne> @xerosigmaprime cmonBruh cmonBruh
[1:48:00] <%Mr_Pylon> it was a really sharp knife, okay
[1:48:03] <%toolofparanoia> little ones though... big ones like from the down under can fuck off
[1:48:06] <SainEdge> @WomboWookie yes
[1:48:07] <%penitentpentwitch> Sharp knife
[1:48:07] <%weissguard> Daddy, no! I like Silent Hill! - Zoe, probably
[1:48:17] <%JumboCrunchies> Yeah Evie's infection powers are crazy.
[1:48:17] <WomboWookie> @sainedge ty
[1:48:19] <KeiPrime> its also impossible to turn into a giant mold beast but he does it
[1:48:19] <Daxalog> Im also assuming the virus turns your bones to jelly
[1:48:22] <SirKeigan> But the knife wouldn't survive
[1:48:25] <+Espadadegusto> Super strength via bugs and virus goo.
[1:48:29] <%maenos2> lol people talking about possibilities when we're talking about a mold that made marge start spitting centiepdes within MINUTES
[1:48:32] <%Shadicara> Seriously who designs these houses?
[1:48:32] <SirKeigan> The knife doesn't have super durability
[1:48:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @chll0ne Something about a centipede with its legs is actually kinda sexy XD
[1:48:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Humans only use 10-15% of our musels max output to avoid damage
[1:48:40] <fairore> I like to think Jack still fighting it
[1:48:42] <rytisone> what a weird house key
[1:48:54] <oligobear> lighter
[1:48:55] <+gustavozxd> @Daxalog considering the boss fights in the main game yeah
[1:48:55] <%JumboCrunchies> I think Lucas designed all the crazy shit in this house.
[1:49:02] <%Skelegroove> That wasn't the mold just then. Jack just really wanted to beat Lucas
[1:49:04] <SirKeigan> And adrenaline let's us use more of that muscle power
[1:49:04] <commanderapathy> @rytisone right?!
[1:49:04] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> dad strength is immeasurable force of nature
[1:49:06] <cherubs_anonymous> Except Lucas
[1:49:08] <%DensityD> zoe is just too moldy
[1:49:10] <Aydarkzero> her freak out there is here trying to fight it
[1:49:13] <$floralkami> @shadicara literally the same person who make the Spencer estate. it's an Easter egg
[1:49:16] <rytisone> noo
[1:49:17] <%Mr_Pylon> Like Jack in the garage blowing his head off was his means of resisting
[1:49:18] <$sylphyyyy> Lucas just went full dio lol
[1:49:20] <%DensityD> lucas such a shit
[1:49:22] <+gustavozxd> wait
[1:49:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Aww nooo
[1:49:25] <%bassoontyphoon> not again
[1:49:25] <brambobelurkin> @RAAAAAINMAKER absolute facts
[1:49:27] <PhantonBat> There is literally a scene in the game where Jack outright tells you this.
[1:49:28] <Divantae> lol sometimes Marguerite tries to swat at her own bug powers
[1:49:28] <%bassoontyphoon> too sad
[1:49:29] <%penitentpentwitch> It's like falling though, the longer it goes the faster it goes
[1:49:30] <Phoenon> Marguerite is strangely more effective at fighting it for some reason
[1:49:32] <Divantae> nooo
[1:49:33] <+gustavozxd> don't you have to use the dog head?
[1:49:34] <%afronooch> :(
[1:49:38] <+amaranthos> Lucas wasn't effected he was just always a massive pile of shit
[1:49:50] <yojohny> Wrong way again LUL
[1:49:52] <wibbwobbler> whoa
[1:49:53] <Divantae> bad end get
[1:49:53] <+gustavozxd> that makes sense
[1:49:59] <$floralkami> @cherubs_anonymous no, Lucas got his for a bit until he got the cure to keep an eye on Eveline
[1:50:01] <%DensityD> the yAArd
[1:50:05] <+evbites> excMia you bitch what did you do
[1:50:05] <+gustavozxd> strong lighter
[1:50:11] <SirKeigan> True
[1:50:12] <$sylphyyyy> ugh pitch black with rain is the big anxiety
[1:50:14] <SirKeigan> Didn't think of it like that
[1:50:16] <MayorRev> epic lighter
[1:50:16] <%AncelDeLambert> so him stabbing himself is probably the same
[1:50:29] <Talfri> Lucas got Mold powers but I believe he got the cure for the mind control part
[1:50:33] <+evbites> Mia you bitch
[1:50:39] <%penitentpentwitch> Reminds me of The Hollow Knight

[1:53:45] <+ConLin_Arts_> Screaming army man
[1:53:45] <%mikessdd> yeah admittedly chris in Village trailer actually looks like chirs not fake chris
[1:53:46] <BluBox> Late streamer
[1:53:47] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> It's Chris Simp, he wasn't injected with the cure
[1:53:48] <+evbites> or code veronica chris
[1:53:49] <+gustavozxd> he's gonna forget the stream and spend the next 2 hours petting the dog
[1:53:50] <wibbwobbler> while the home is rotten and abandoned, they were still acting like a family? creepy...
[1:53:50] <%DensityD> psaGeif
[1:53:51] <pizza_oven3000> his cousin Mark
[1:53:54] <PanicSwytch> Pats gonna remodel his bathroom with poop
[1:53:57] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Oh god I thought we were going to have to look at that roaring chris face as he left
[1:53:57] <brambobelurkin> Not a hero aka save the turkey baster aka operation goof juice aka gamer goo chronicles
[1:53:59] <robo_badger> In order to find out if it is Chris we should ask his opinion on the state of the Redfield bloodline
[1:54:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "Ok guys I'm gonna go for a Chris break"
[1:54:08] <bluefooddye1> I'm not Chris, I'm my own original character, Bhris
[1:54:09] <Gallhint> Well i mean RE2 remake leon doesnt look like RE2 leoin
[1:54:14] <Varrens> oooooh theres a new cut in for the Puppy :3
[1:54:16] <%penitentpentwitch> Still find it funny Chris's RE8 design looks like he ate Wesker and Mr.X
[1:54:21] <%DensityD> psaDogChamp
[1:54:25] <Gallhint> they probably planned to re characterise all the re cast
[1:54:30] <+evbites> This is before chris realized leon needed to fuck claire
[1:54:31] <DrivenDust> awwwww, I didn't see that they added Zangief yet widepeepoHappy
[1:54:45] <%MidnightBurst12> psaDogchamp
[1:54:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> psaDogchamp
[1:54:58] <PiotrRasputin> RE8 Chris ate too many steaks at that Romanian bar.
[1:55:15] <%DensityD> sheva dead?
[1:55:26] <$floralkami> @xerosigmaprime bits of the house were by Trevor's design, yeah. certain parts Jack built would literally not have worked within Trevor's input (the crawl space between the den and backyard balcony, the garden). these were later expanded upon by Lucas with his room and secret doors. point is, the same guy that build the houses locking mechanisms did so for the Spencer estate and the police station.
[1:55:27] <+evbites> Chris went back to steroids during not a hero
[1:55:28] <%toolofparanoia> he just keeps getting stronger
[1:55:45] <Aydarkzero> @DensityD into the void of maybe we'll use that character
[1:55:49] <%Skelegroove> RE8 is just gonna be that all the old myths and legends were actually viruses
[1:55:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> @evbites No on the contrary he lost weight from depression after failing to get Leon to fuck Claire. However after meeting Ethan and finding him to be a prime candidate, he roids up again for RE8 to go after Ethan
[1:56:13] <%toolofparanoia> sheva dead in the sense she's alive and can come back if capcom decides to bring her back
[1:56:36] <%penitentpentwitch> Chris: "Ethan! Your mold powers make you super fertile! Continue the Redfield Bloodline!"
[1:56:41] <$floralkami> ... I wonder what would be the reasoning for RE8's puzzles and mechanics.
[1:56:47] <PiotrRasputin> @Skelegroove Makes sense. Spencer could be tied to it as well.
[1:56:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> psaDogchamp_HF psaDogchamp psaDogchamp_HF psaDogchamp psaUp_HF
[1:56:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah his Chris is just on his off cycle, office drug tests have tobeclean
[1:57:09] <PhantonBat> Creepy European Castle bullshit
[1:57:10] <+evbites> I don't get why "jill dies" in re 5 only for that to go back down and for her to be used in wesker's creepy waifu creator
[1:57:24] <AFlyingTaco1> Maybe Chris has to beef up for RE8 cuz it's in a cold environment
[1:57:29] <%mikessdd> Spencer is dead. Only thing left is a chilled tube of his sperm in a lab somewhere
[1:57:54] <$floralkami> @evbites cause that game wasn't as great as people like to imagine it was.
[1:58:09] <PiotrRasputin> Spencer is the Palpatine of RE. He'll never truly be dead.
[1:58:11] <+evbites> Not even a joke anymore chris can use the steroids upgrade in the dlc
[1:58:24] <%penitentpentwitch> The RE8 trailer is trying to sell Chris as a villain. Maybe he'll take the 'necessary evil' route?
[1:58:40] <%mikessdd> Oh shit chris uses the steroids in this dlc? that's on the nose
[1:58:43] <%DensityD> welcome back
[1:58:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Wassup ho
[1:58:46] <AFlyingTaco1> I just hope the village is as creepy as RE4's
[1:58:52] <Varrens> Welcome back
[1:58:52] <%rissaleigh14> that's good
[1:59:01] <ergulor> Burg?
[1:59:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Does paige want to see the redfield nonsense
[1:59:03] <rytisone> @penitentpentwitch And Dante in DMC4 is evil
[1:59:04] <Varrens> Awww we love the pupper
[1:59:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> Is Paige not gonna watch the DLC? @PatStaresAt
[1:59:05] <%mikessdd> I mean Capcom was like no it is Chris we just used model scan and we're sorry we fucked up
[1:59:07] <+xeros720> he back
[1:59:13] <%asgard147> RE8 better have someone say "witch" with complete seriousness
[1:59:14] <%bassoontyphoon> why is he wanted alive though?
[1:59:15] <UncleAndross_> it's all according to puppy plan
[1:59:23] <+xeros720> barfk
[1:59:24] <%penitentpentwitch> @rytisone Exactly
[1:59:25] <%DappercatEsquire> Lucas fuckin would
[1:59:26] <gruulmagebeast> its the boulder boy
[1:59:27] <PhantonBat> I like to think Chris is like Bane...skinny until he juices on whatever in this universe, then becomes a monster
[1:59:28] <DrivenDust> Never saw this lol
[1:59:29] <%bluescreen1988> Fuckin Inc
[1:59:29] <+evbites> aso mia is evil so maybe chris was assigned to take her out
[1:59:32] <Phoenon> The absolute hook on this nose
[1:59:35] <%toolofparanoia> i want village to be like proto RE4 was... with the hook man

[2:00:03] <Phoenon> John Redfield, back in action
[2:00:05] <PhantonBat> Does anyone else think that Lucas looks like a cracked out Troy Baker?
[2:00:13] <lazypointer> the what?
[2:00:13] <%DensityD> JOHN
[2:00:14] <%Bailey__gaming> sounds like a 70's soul band

[2:00:39] <Azathotic> Remember the shitty terrorists in Rev1 they tried to make the new Umbrella?
[2:00:42] <PhantonBat> Why did we have to get rid of Rodger Craig Smith as Chris? We had a good thing going
[2:00:43] <%maskofmichael> @BallerSwagBro9k No Answers, Only Questions!
[2:00:43] <%Meidolaon> That or the thing that Reveleatons was supposed to lead into
[2:00:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> I doubt any RE6 lore will ever be pursued LUL
[2:00:48] <Phoenon> Of their BEST
[2:00:48] <AFlyingTaco1> EY youse can't turn your back on DA FAMILY
[2:00:51] <%Bailey__gaming> Please welcome the musical stylings of Lucas & The Connections
[2:00:52] <rytisone> rip those guys
[2:01:02] <%penitentpentwitch> It's a tough market for Evil ever since Umbrella dissolved into 200 evil companies. Only so many names before you sound ridiculous.
[2:01:03] <Divantae> ready for Blubrella to be a part of Connections too
[2:01:03] <%mikessdd> Oh jesus I just realised Lucas kinda looks like an uncle of mine fuck
[2:01:04] <%NopeBadguy> isn't the connections wesker's organization or is that hcf
[2:01:07] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp

[2:01:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> That dog Learned from the best
[2:01:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Chris Redfield is just a codename like James Bond
[2:01:14] <+amaranthos> pupper
[2:01:15] <%Skelegroove> Revelations 1 might as well be fan fiction
[2:01:19] <%penitentpentwitch> And Umbrella is not a high starting point

[2:01:28] <%the22cstomp> psaDogchamp
[2:01:30] <+OwlLightningMage> I think Chris can also punch stuff in this DLC
[2:01:32] <+amaranthos> bork bork pupper
[2:01:33] <$floralkami> @ballerswagbro9k let that game cease to exist in any form or thought.
[2:01:34] <DrivenDust> GIEF widepeepoHappy
[2:01:35] <watts121> Pat still a sweaty pepperoni boi?
[2:01:48] <+spaghetti_shaman> Yup ChuckECheese has a Twitch Channel
[2:01:49] <+evbites> The E virus
[2:01:51] <Aydarkzero> @watts121 always is
[2:01:58] <+lordericter> I wonder if the reason chris is so bulky in Re8 is that the clone is mutating due to experimentation or limited lifespan
[2:02:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> @floralkami Wipe it from the timiline
[2:02:05] <SaltyAzteca> what...
[2:02:05] <%asgard147> "BE SILENT PUNCHING BAG!" psaPorgmo
[2:02:09] <PhantonBat> I can't believe he named a shotgun after Wesker as well...seriously couldn't he have named it after Joseph frost or something instead?
[2:02:09] <PiotrRasputin> The Gief is UNLEASHED.

[2:02:38] <Huntercd> Bullshit
[2:02:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> Thats not promising
[2:02:40] <%mikessdd> I mean the real answer for chris in 8 is people hating how he looks in this game
[2:02:41] <%cowardman93> psaDogchamp
[2:02:41] <%Skelegroove> Who cares about the name
[2:02:44] <+evbites> It's 5:00 on the east coast
[2:02:47] <DianaTheAscian> bull
[2:02:51] <annearkie> is chris dumb enough to believe that?
[2:02:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Keeping the name is fucking ballsy
[2:02:56] <%mikessdd> So as usual nothing matters
[2:02:58] <AFlyingTaco1> Motherfuckin' PMCs again
[2:02:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> A FORMER CORRUPT CORP BECOMING A PMC? SEEMS LEGIT
[2:03:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> discipline your child, take away his ps4
[2:03:02] <%penitentpentwitch> It may be a long time before you can trust Gief with Elmo's food bowl
[2:03:02] <+amaranthos> careful not to cut yourself on all that edge
[2:03:03] <Aydarkzero> knife tech
[2:03:05] <cephas97> @ballerswagbro9k please remind pat about the parry, hes gonna die so many times
[2:03:11] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:03:18] <PhantonBat> No, he literally tells them they're full of shit
[2:03:20] <lazypointer> "We wanted people to think we're good, so we made our logo a swastika but Blue"
[2:03:20] <%DensityD> PogChamp
[2:03:24] <Huntercd> How is a PMC going to be law enforcement?
[2:03:25] <%ClutchRoadagain> If anything, attaching the Umbrella name makes it super fishy.
[2:03:29] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm excited for this Chris to fight roided roid Chris in RE8

[2:03:58] <Sotetsu> He wasted a bullet, restart the playthrough
[2:03:59] <ShichiNoBushi> Chris used Rock Smash.
[2:04:01] <PhantonBat> You don't need ammo
[2:04:03] <TheHylianGuard> Not quite the RE4 melee system, but similar
[2:04:04] <+amaranthos> was it Jack's brother that had a DLC where you go to town with nothing but your fists
[2:04:05] <%DappercatEsquire> they're lucky they aren't boulders

[2:04:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> People on the ship
[2:04:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> blocking is for cowards
[2:04:56] <+Fep3> this... is still RE7?
[2:04:56] <chaumiester> That's the one subtle difference I like between Chris and Ethan. Ethan doesn't know how to aim..... fat thumbed that last message
[2:05:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> and people they kidnapped
[2:05:01] <PiotrRasputin> Well.. he's definitely going to sound like Carlos in 8.
[2:05:02] <%penitentpentwitch> How many people are needed on a supertanker?
[2:05:02] <cephas97> @ballerswagbro9k noooooooooooo
[2:05:03] <%ScottishMadJacko> I miss old chris
[2:05:06] <MayorRev> that
[2:05:08] <pizza_oven3000> this is Chris step brother Jerry
[2:05:12] <%Arxel1> I mean, there was that whole boat....
[2:05:12] <+spaghetti_shaman> But where is the 5th family member Troy Baker?
[2:05:12] <+amaranthos> Joe Baker for president
[2:05:19] <AFlyingTaco1> Make Joe Baker the hero of RE8
[2:05:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @chaumiester I noticed that as well
[2:05:22] <%Meekest> This is Chris Jr
[2:05:25] <$floralkami> @patstaresat they did get dozens of people, the ship was right near the house area
[2:05:27] <%mike2hands> the people in the boat
[2:05:30] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Remeber there are coins, so search those corners
[2:05:34] <%mike2hands> that was a big ass boat
[2:05:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> unbind block, Chris would never do that
[2:05:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> @pizza_oven3000 What's the deal with zomboies?
[2:05:48] <heartlesshealer> hi Lucas
[2:05:50] <PhantonBat> @spaghetti_shaman He got addicted to meth and changed his name to Lucas
[2:05:53] <+evbites> this is great
[2:06:07] <heartlesshealer> oh no the evil within 2 happened
[2:06:12] <LordOfThePoultry> what a fucker
[2:06:18] <+unclekulikov> the fuck
[2:06:18] <%Shadicara> Literally everyone knows chris
[2:06:21] <+xeros720> really should've just shot him
[2:06:21] <%mikessdd> that's how we know it's really chirs. people died and it's his fault lol
[2:06:22] <%NopeBadguy> why does Lucas know his name
[2:06:22] <Phoenon> Chris' reaction time is pretty trash
[2:06:23] <+spaghetti_shaman> Did Chris hand blew up
[2:06:23] <+amaranthos> what a piece of shit
[2:06:27] <+spaghetti_shaman> nvm
[2:06:28] <+AcrutaLao> Fawk
[2:06:29] <+evbites> Brains vs brawn
[2:06:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> What an asshole
[2:06:33] <PhantonBat> How much time did this take to set up?
[2:06:40] <SainEdge> yeah he is a coward and asshole LUL
[2:06:44] <%Konquerer> such an asshat
[2:06:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> @NopeBadguy I assume "The Company" gives hin intel
[2:06:49] <MayorRev> "f u c k"
[2:06:55] <$ItsRatman> he could kill Chris right there, but nah gotta be an asshole
[2:06:58] <+D00msDayDan> don't forget to wipe your mask too
[2:07:05] <rytisone> NO TIME
[2:07:07] <PhantonBat> The worst mechanic for an action focused DLC to have
[2:07:08] <chaumiester> Why do they keep sending Chris in alone all the time. At least a backup buddy or something right?
[2:07:11] <$floralkami> @phantonbat this was going on for at least 6 months, so he had time
[2:07:12] <%madskull456> Thanks for the HyperCooldown @gespenst25
[2:07:15] <blackkanye> There is no time!
[2:07:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> NO NOT CHRIS"S ARM
[2:07:18] <%penitentpentwitch> I'm glad you don't have to find filters
[2:07:18] <Phoenon> Lucas sure can run fast
[2:07:30] <heartlesshealer> he coulda killed the most powerful man alive in the RE universe, but gotta be a asshole first =p
[2:07:35] <Aydarkzero> @chaumiester isn't his whole deal is he doesn't want to see anybody else die?
[2:07:42] <+evbites> @chaumiester They all get captured
[2:07:43] <LordZazas> Damn, Lucas booked it while wearing that heavy tactical gear
[2:07:47] <MayorRev> woolieCHAN
[2:07:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Such a causal, there's no time... what a hero
[2:07:50] <%NopeBadguy> if it goes off, you can get a cool bionic arm just like that Spencer guy
[2:07:52] <+spaghetti_shaman> What if it isn't a bomb but a bom
[2:08:00] <ThunderRemix8> he looks smaller, but the boulder punching is still there
[2:08:01] <%Raiden_Breaker> The Hud makes this look Sci-fi at times
[2:08:03] <PhantonBat> @floralkami I meant the whole dressing up as a member of Chris' team and waiting for him
[2:08:03] <%penitentpentwitch> Chris must protect his boulder punching arm
[2:08:04] <ha2ken> Son of a bitch LUL
[2:08:07] <+evbites> everyone not a main guy is already dead
[2:08:09] <TheHylianGuard> @RAAAAAINMAKER Not a hero*
[2:08:10] <chaumiester> @evbites Before. I mean, he did land with a bunch of other guys
[2:08:20] <rytisone> this shoulda been at the end of the main game
[2:08:21] <chhdez> Panch!
[2:08:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> You shot most of us
[2:08:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> @chaumiester They do send people but Chris lets them all die LUL
[2:08:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> GIB HUNNIGAN
[2:08:37] <%Skelegroove> "All that's left now is the name" You JUST killed another BOW
[2:08:39] <AFlyingTaco1> So what she's saying is Hunk runs the company
[2:08:41] <SaltyAzteca> see that zombie? he was one of us!
[2:08:57] <%mikessdd> FAmbly
[2:09:01] <$floralkami> @phantonbat probably 20 minutes. he knew they were coming.
[2:09:02] <+Estuko> We playing Republic Commando? PogChamp
[2:09:06] <Phoenon> Steroids LUL
[2:09:09] <%mikessdd> think Lucasa drinks faygo?
[2:09:12] <+amaranthos> all the drugs
[2:09:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> @AFlyingTaco1 Man imagine we get a HUNK/CHRIS teamup XD
[2:09:19] <spongeofmystery> Chris Redfield and steroids? NEVER
[2:09:22] <+spaghetti_shaman> "Lucan has the info of Leons whereabouts, Leon will get my sister preggo by my will it will happen" - RE8 plot
[2:09:23] <+evbites> CHRIS LOOKING AT ROIDS MY OLD FRIEND
[2:09:23] <blackkanye> roids!?
[2:09:24] <+amaranthos> one weed please
[2:09:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chris doesn't know what steroids are
[2:09:25] <Dragovus> No sympy for Steve
[2:09:27] <Nickdick96> chris, just crack your knuckles to reload faster
[2:09:30] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[2:09:32] <faithless_zealot> LUL
[2:09:37] <MayorRev> Are those boulder punching steroids?
[2:09:38] <LordOfThePoultry> his favorite
[2:09:42] <+BeezusHrist> I LOVE STEROIDS TOO!!!
[2:09:43] <%Totally_Not_Toby> by the end of this dlc he's as big as he is in the 8 trailer
[2:09:48] <KaiserMario> I believe there is a coin in this room
[2:09:51] <+BeezusHrist> RAWR
[2:09:57] <%penitentpentwitch> Chris uses the steroids, it just fills up needle rather than put more in him.
[2:09:58] <yojohny> Deux
[2:10:00] <%afronooch> i wonder if faygo is better or worse off due to the culture?
[2:10:02] <simulationbard> Chris get's the steroids and just eats the syringe whole
[2:10:06] <Phoenon> HURRK
[2:10:08] <SainEdge> there is also a box and a savepoint in the big room
[2:10:09] <%asgard147> what if they make it canon in RE8 that Chris REALLY does take steroids?
[2:10:26] <+BigCoffee> who fucking makes these doors
[2:10:26] <PhantonBat> How? How did he get this strong? How many press ups did he do? How many sit ups? What kind of juice did he drink?!?
[2:10:36] <Phoenon> URRRRGH
[2:10:39] <Nickdick96> @asgard147 universal duh?
[2:10:44] <+BigCoffee> 100 push ups, 100 situps, 100 squats, 10km a day
[2:10:46] <%LeiaSkynoober> Chris would never take steroids, winners don’t take drugs
[2:10:47] <%mikessdd> I mean the culture has definitely given Faygo more mind share than they ever could've gotten through traditional marketing
[2:10:51] <SlimeSlimeSlime> He's go the rona!
[2:10:52] <%ClutchRoadagain> The mold is too powerful
[2:10:52] <%Totally_Not_Toby> there's too much fucking garbage
[2:10:54] <faithless_zealot> De poo-poo gas is too stronk
[2:10:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> Why is coughing? He has a filter LUL
[2:11:03] <AFlyingTaco1> He trains by punching boulders
[2:11:06] <mark_collins45> the potato salad had more mold than that.
[2:11:06] <PhantonBat> @BigCoffee Yo
[2:11:09] <+evbites> THE IDEA OF GASMASKS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE
[2:11:11] <%Shadicara> No shut up pat Kappa
[2:11:13] <%penitentpentwitch> After a point, you would think the veteran RE characters would just carry satchel charges at all times
[2:11:16] <%Meekest> How did Ethan survive
[2:11:22] <%Totally_Not_Toby> not for chris though he's too tough
[2:11:22] <@commanderclaw> Chris' immune system punches the spores
[2:11:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Not if you're a badass Pat. Duh
[2:11:27] <%Skelegroove> Mold creates the weakest monsters though
[2:11:27] <+D00msDayDan> a very potent curse
[2:11:31] <%AquilaHarukaze> he just clenches his lung muscles and they destroy the virus
[2:11:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> CHRIS NOSE MUSCLES PROTECT HIM
[2:11:35] <$floralkami> yes, it is airborne
[2:11:35] <%DensityD> it's a biohazard
[2:11:36] <+BeezusHrist> HE HAS A VACCINE PAT
[2:11:38] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Chris only uses guns to give the monsters a chance
[2:11:38] <%Meekest> Chris what
[2:11:39] <%mikessdd> oh look more people to die on chris' watch
[2:11:42] <%toolofparanoia> not even the Airborne C-virus?
[2:11:51] <rytisone> the protagonists of RE universe are super people
[2:11:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Meekest he was infested but evie didn't want to drive him mad at frist
[2:11:57] <AFlyingTaco1> Nice
[2:12:01] <+evbites> I like to think this is Chris's cousin
[2:12:02] <Nickdick96> they don't get infected because they never got bitten canonically
[2:12:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> 3 years
[2:12:11] <+xeros720> if they didn't need a person to spread it, it'd be a pretty effective weapon
[2:12:12] <cosmicgoatee> Paige almost became a molded when she didn't look at that potato salad
[2:12:21] <@commanderclaw> You could send Evie into a major metropolitan area and it'll be worse than Raccoon city in a day
[2:12:28] <AFlyingTaco1> The RE protagonists are safe from viruses because they never have sex
[2:12:29] <%DensityD> jiggle jiggle
[2:12:30] <+BeezusHrist> Viral Funguses are hard to transmit to other humans... in real life
[2:12:31] <%Totally_Not_Toby> oh nice very good
[2:12:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> @rytisone Chris is the STR user. Leon is DEX, Claire is INT
[2:12:34] <%penitentpentwitch> And she creates patches which are also likely infectious
[2:12:38] <%mikessdd> that's a shitty grenade
[2:12:39] <%Totally_Not_Toby> very cool collision
[2:12:44] <Phoenon> Probably fun to see Knife Only runs of this
[2:12:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige is totally a molded. Paige has the puppy virus
[2:12:52] <mark_collins45> great lighting in this game.
[2:12:54] <chaumiester> I mean, there was the conversation that.... these bio-weapons. While powerful. Were also.... kinda dumb
[2:12:57] <LordZazas> FRAG OUT
[2:12:58] <PhantonBat> What is with this channel points thing?
[2:12:59] <%DensityD> sheva is CHR?
[2:13:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BeezusHrist yes but we breath in mold all the time
[2:13:06] <+spaghetti_shaman> This is what Resident Evil Survivor should've been
[2:13:06] <+BeezusHrist> There is currently no way to make a vaccine for a fungal virus
[2:13:07] <+SH1NK1R0> Once the airborne virus settles after a few hours it becomes standard t virus infection method.
[2:13:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> GRENADA
[2:13:12] <LordZazas> FRAG OUT AGAIN
[2:13:15] <faithless_zealot> @cosmicgoatee LUL
[2:13:16] <LordZazas> AND A THIRD
[2:13:17] <Aydarkzero> Sheva is ADP LUL
[2:13:17] <%AquilaHarukaze> There's SO many of them what
[2:13:19] <LordZazas> BLYAT
[2:13:21] <%Totally_Not_Toby> theres so many of these guys
[2:13:22] <+BeezusHrist> @doc_ock_rokc Yeah, and most of it is harmless
[2:13:24] <+Estuko> @PhantonBat it's for doing varioius chat things like "unlock emote for 24hrs" or "high messages" etc
[2:13:25] <PhantonBat> @doc_ock_rokc And it's super bad for you
[2:13:26] <%mikessdd> shotgun good do
[2:13:29] <%Totally_Not_Toby> oh MORE
[2:13:31] <%Loinclothiclese> @PhantonBat to do whatever channel stuff is set in by the streamer....
[2:13:32] <+Estuko> orly
[2:13:33] <Guardiansaiyan> sup
[2:13:34] <%anticrust> really
[2:13:38] <%Meekest> Chris is so unfazed
[2:13:39] <%penitentpentwitch> DLC, gotta make it tough
[2:13:40] <%DensityD> it's always the 16th molded that gets you
[2:13:42] <+spaghetti_shaman> Chris had it easy
[2:13:42] <+evbites> it feels so good to see someone fully armed for a mission
[2:13:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> Really really
[2:13:47] <PiotrRasputin> Exactly.
[2:13:47] <Guardiansaiyan> B O U L D E R
[2:13:48] <PhantonBat> Weird
[2:13:51] <KaiserMario> Blind
[2:13:51] <%penitentpentwitch> Well, "tough"
[2:13:52] <rytisone> and then Pat dies
[2:13:52] <BlueLunecy> Chris could probably eat the mold and be just fine
[2:13:53] <LordZazas> AND THEY DON'T STOP COMING AND THEY DON'T STOP COMING
[2:13:53] <Guardiansaiyan> Punch a BOULDER
[2:13:55] <+NitronStreams> damn i miss the start ofthe stream and you're already on not a redfield
[2:13:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> These zombies are EASY TO KILL
[2:14:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> HE FOUGHT IN VOLCANO
[2:14:00] <chaumiester> This is Chris "Boulder Puncher" Redfield!
[2:14:02] <+amaranthos> all geared up uhahahaha
[2:14:03] <%Meekest> Chris had to deal with black people this is nothing
[2:14:03] <KaiserMario> missed handgun ammo
[2:14:04] <%ospreyworks> Molded vs Crimson heads
[2:14:06] <Futurecity10> Chris "Killed my wife so I'd have to fuck his sister" Redfield
[2:14:10] <PhantonBat> Which is why the gas mask shit is so tedious in this DLC
[2:14:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> Chris is like god gimme a challenge and not stupid mold
[2:14:10] <%toolofparanoia> Chris is like "BITCH I PUNCHED A BOULDER!"
[2:14:14] <%mikessdd> yeah Chris dispatching molded with lethal efficiency reads pretty well
[2:14:22] <%Garthunox> has chris even been the sole protagonist of a game?
[2:14:25] <DensityD> no way, friend
[2:14:30] <spongeofmystery> Killed an OG Tyrant, a weird bug lady, and superhuman vampire cosplayer Albert Wesker
[2:14:34] <+spaghetti_shaman> Pat will you stream Resident Evil Survivor for the PS1?
[2:14:39] <PhantonBat> And MW players saw the Origin 12 sucjs
[2:14:46] <%penitentpentwitch> Send a mold covered boulder at Chris, then we'll talk
[2:14:46] <%cowardman93> this is quite literally a day at the office for Chris
[2:14:47] <Phoenon> Dude could solo this whole mission with a knife if he wanted to
[2:14:51] <%ospreyworks> Nah, because Chris couldn't carry a game on his own, tbh
[2:14:52] <chaumiester> Do you think Chris tells that story all the time at parties? About the time he punched a boulder?
[2:14:54] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt he probably thinks Chris is just a random spec ops
[2:14:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> a precious antique coin...
[2:14:59] <%ospreyworks> He ain't exactly Mr. Charisma
[2:15:00] <+Estuko> I want to see chris just grab a mold by the head and, fucks sake there's already that guy in the fucking DLC punching mold and power bombing bitches
[2:15:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pffft they don't even teleport
[2:15:05] <%mikessdd> lol
[2:15:07] <rytisone> he fought the final boss in an active volcano
[2:15:07] <%DensityD> soap
[2:15:09] <faithless_zealot> LUL
[2:15:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> I still wish Chris and Wesker had had a shirtlees fistfight in the volcano
[2:15:12] <+evbites> but soap is dead
[2:15:12] <faithless_zealot> RE!
[2:15:12] <%ScottishMadJacko> God, imagine
[2:15:15] <%toolofparanoia> lol kinda does
[2:15:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Playing as hunk in RE2
[2:15:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> SOAP BibleThump
[2:15:19] <PhantonBat> @spaghetti_shaman He'd probably respond with something about rolling in razor blades
[2:15:20] <SainEdge> true LUL
[2:15:20] <TheHylianGuard> We need Soap to clean off this mould
[2:15:20] <Phoenon> If that scrub Ethan can rampage through these, imagine Chris' ease
[2:15:20] <%NopeBadguy> that's probably why they made this dlc standalone and free
[2:15:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> check these corners, Soap
[2:15:23] <+BeezusHrist> @Garthunox Resident Evil 4 is the only game with a sole protagonist
[2:15:25] <%ScottishMadJacko> Soap is alive in my heart
[2:15:26] <%CzeekyPlays> Famed protag of RE1, Soap McTavish
[2:15:26] <chhdez> Antique quoang
[2:15:26] <Aydarkzero> c r a n k
[2:15:26] <+amaranthos> take the crank
[2:15:27] <Guardiansaiyan> @BallerSwagBro9k at least Wesker was shirtless
[2:15:30] <AquilaHarukaze> What kind of name is Soap
[2:15:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chris has Reached HUNK status
[2:15:43] <%Garthunox> @aquilaharukaze a nickname
[2:15:44] <KaiserMario> Equip that now!
[2:15:46] <%penitentpentwitch> Don't drop the protagonist
[2:15:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> @AquilaHarukaze That's classified
[2:15:52] <annearkie> here comes mungoooo
[2:15:53] <Phoenon> Aw a big slow target, that's cute
[2:15:55] <rytisone> wasted
[2:16:03] <%AquilaHarukaze> How'd a muppet like him get past selection
[2:16:04] <Phoenon> High regeneration? TIME TO PUNCH
[2:16:04] <%Meekest> They're just like shit's fucked
[2:16:07] <jimmytwofeet> WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
[2:16:10] <chaumiester> Or Leon "Sexy" Kennedy
[2:16:11] <%ospreyworks> Right? The four of them should be straight up celebrities
[2:16:12] <%mikessdd> As soon as any of them show up. Oh fuck pack it up people we gotta go!
[2:16:13] <%Meekest> Chris is like "whatever"
[2:16:15] <%Dementedpenguin> Chris: psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[2:16:18] <%Totally_Not_Toby> chris really should just rip it apart with his bare hands
[2:16:18] <+amaranthos> smoky molded
[2:16:19] <TheHylianGuard> doesn't look very new to me
[2:16:19] <+Estuko> That's a HUGE BITCH
[2:16:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> PUNCH IT CHRIS
[2:16:20] <%anticrust> lorge
[2:16:21] <Phoenon> It's a wicker man
[2:16:22] <KaiserMario> You need RAMRODS
[2:16:23] <%DappercatEsquire> "What am I looking at" *shrug*
[2:16:24] <rufus2k2> man this dlc really made Chris into a wuss
[2:16:24] <%penitentpentwitch> King Orb comes
[2:16:27] <SaltyAzteca> it's a fat regenerator
[2:16:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chris "Oh is this a Regenerator?"
[2:16:32] <rytisone> see you later, fucker
[2:16:32] <Nickdick96> even chirs know better than messing with Mushroom Father
[2:16:33] <%Garthunox> That's one big man babeh
[2:16:40] <%DensityD> the power of sandbagging the molded
[2:16:41] <%DensityD> wow
[2:16:42] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> "I wanted to meet the Grim Reaper" Best line in RE2R
[2:16:46] <%AquilaHarukaze> How to deal with monster: Don't
[2:16:48] <+OwlLightningMage> I wish more villains in long running series acknowledged how strong the protagonists are. Like Yakuza villains shitting their pants seeing Kiryu in later games
[2:16:49] <Aydarkzero> watch out for these people
[2:16:49] <%ClutchRoadagain> The years have not been kind to the regenerator.
[2:16:51] <+evbites> Chris is like this is not the worst thing i've dealt with
[2:16:57] <rytisone> this poor guy
[2:16:58] <%ospreyworks> List of People to Not Kidnap Ever Again: Claire Redfield

[2:18:26] <+xeros720> "we only have one filter that successfully stops it" "we gave it to the other guy"
[2:18:26] <CursedNobleman> swapping the filter doesnt un-contaminate you Kappa
[2:18:29] <%Totally_Not_Toby> does that make him super stronger
[2:18:31] <+PulleylubeTW> RIGHT
[2:18:31] <%cvp5127> shhhhh
[2:18:31] <+spaghetti_shaman> he is immune
[2:18:32] <%DappercatEsquire> SHUT UP
[2:18:33] <%DensityD> it's heavy
[2:18:35] <%ScottishMadJacko> Exactly
[2:18:35] <%AkronymCLT> Getting put in Chris' or Hunk's squad might as well be a death sentence

[2:18:37] <%Meekest> Shut up
[2:18:37] <TheHylianGuard> chris had a knife, he could have freed him
[2:18:37] <%Skelegroove> Budget cuts
[2:18:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> No idea
[2:18:37] <%miguelrod777> budget cuts
[2:18:37] <+reycharles75> moneys tight
[2:18:38] <%Shadicara> Because he punches boulders pat
[2:18:38] <rytisone> cause video gmaes
[2:18:38] <+Taglog7> cuz plot
[2:18:38] <+evbites> he likes to scavenge
[2:18:39] <%Dementedpenguin> He's stingy.
[2:18:39] <heartlesshealer> ALL BRAIN NUTRIENT TO FIST
[2:18:39] <+Qsmash_> never needed one before
[2:18:40] <+ColonelHandzLanza> This is a Chris clone created by Nubrella obviously
[2:18:40] <PiotrRasputin> Cause video games.
[2:18:40] <%weissguard> Cause Stumbo
[2:18:40] <Nickdick96> he choose big shotgun instead of filter as his starting gift
[2:18:41] <%NopeBadguy> because he needs to power up
[2:18:41] <+lordericter> it is a mystery
[2:18:41] <chaumiester> Because he has the memory of a Goldfish or Blue Umbrella trying to kill him
[2:18:42] <@commanderclaw> So that people can die around him
[2:18:42] <LordOfThePoultry> shhhhh
[2:18:42] <Xiangchang> Because he's Chris Redfield!
[2:18:42] <%VHGS> only made one
[2:18:43] <%NovaKnightmare> TENSION
[2:18:43] <%ospreyworks> Because New Umbrella actually wants to kill him maybe???
[2:18:43] <+bugz_munny> cuz he doesnt trust umbrella tech lol
[2:18:43] <blackkanye> Gameplay shut up
[2:18:44] <+xeros720> fuck, why the hell isn't the ANTI BOW PMC buying them?
[2:18:45] <Aydarkzero> b/c he's Chris Redfield
[2:18:45] <%DensityD> budget
[2:18:45] <+Brostress> Because he's thick, thick fraud
[2:18:46] <pizza_oven3000> Gameplay SHUT UP
[2:18:46] <+OwlLightningMage> Because he's never been infected before. Duh
[2:18:48] <$Caped_Eggy> Corona isn't around yet when the game came out
[2:18:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> he's flex the whole time
[2:18:50] <%AquilaHarukaze> I came in late and just assumed he lost his or something. Did he seriously come in without one???
[2:18:51] <robo_badger> Hisbosses are cheapskates
[2:18:51] <%Jekado> he was gonna punch the spores away
[2:18:51] <Huntercd> Blue Umbrella supplied him
[2:18:54] <%cowardman93> for plot!
[2:18:54] <Srthunda> He wanted cool guns instead
[2:18:54] <SaltyAzteca> because the plot dude, it's like every other encounter he's been in
[2:18:55] <%ArcanumArcanum> He has rights Pat. You can't make him wear a high grade mask
[2:18:58] <annearkie> he needs pure oxygen to fuel his strength
[2:18:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Why would he need to LUL
[2:19:00] <+RyTYoung> Because Chris never comes fully equipped to anything
[2:19:00] <%mikessdd> BSAA defense budget
[2:19:00] <+BeezusHrist> DONALD TRUMP CUT THE UMBRELLA FEMA BUDGET
[2:19:00] <KaiserMario> Probably cause Lucas put that filter on the guy...
[2:19:02] <%toolofparanoia> Umbrella didn't think he was worth it.
[2:19:02] <%anticrust> He's Done this before, he knows that anything he needs will miraculously be on site
[2:19:03] <+amaranthos> bureaucratic mixup?
[2:19:03] <+spaghetti_shaman> LUCAS WHERE IS LEON!!!!!!!!!!
[2:19:03] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt nope

[2:19:20] <rufus2k2> They Caught Billy!
[2:19:21] <%Dementedpenguin> I feel like they do a "better" job blowing them up.
[2:19:21] <chaumiester> .................Sherry?
[2:19:23] <brachydios777> Nada
[2:19:24] <%Skelegroove> They caught that guy at the end of REV1 didn't they?

[2:20:06] <spongeofmystery> You mean that guy in 5. Irving?
[2:20:06] <%AquilaHarukaze> The voice is that guy from RE5

[2:20:29] <@SoFarFetched> BY PUNCHING IT
[2:20:30] <%anticrust> POUNCH
[2:20:34] <faithless_zealot> He was such a good bad guy
[2:20:35] <%Totally_Not_Toby> use your BEAST FISTS
[2:20:35] <chaumiester> Better then RE6, where Chris was running around with the cheapest no name pistol ever
[2:20:38] <%mikessdd> It's always the white ones lol
[2:20:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> RAMRODS
[2:20:40] <%AquilaHarukaze> "Normal ammo isn't going to cut it" *PUNCH!*
[2:20:41] <+amaranthos> ramrods
[2:20:42] <%verscoll> LUL
[2:20:42] <$floralkami> @patstaresat didn't Chris's high grade filter get damaged after the first explosion?
[2:20:43] <Aydarkzero> i just ran around them LUL
[2:20:44] <%NopeBadguy> this reminds me of Metroid prime
[2:20:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> RAMROD Kreygasm

[2:20:50] <SpaceGuntank> RAMRODS LUL

[2:20:56] <jimmytwofeet> IS THIS DLC
[2:20:58] <%CrookedSpiral> say car RAMROD
[2:20:59] <KaiserMario> You have to go past him
[2:20:59] <+BeezusHrist> @doc_ock_rokc Not the new company. It went through bankruptcy and was bought out by the government and repurposed as a biohazard response agency
[2:21:00] <rufus2k2> GUESS WHAT
[2:21:01] <Guardiansaiyan> SEXY TYRANT
[2:21:01] <%DensityD> the big penis
[2:21:01] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL

[2:21:08] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> sexy poison

[2:21:09] <%Konquerer> wesker is the only one who gets to be cool
[2:21:10] <BluBox> Sexy tyrant Kreygasm
[2:21:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> 14 NAKED BSAA AGENTS AT RAMROD RANCH
[2:21:13] <%NopeBadguy> and then he's like a giant blob with three big penises with eyes on em
[2:21:16] <%mikessdd> when you said sexy tyrant I imagined sexy squidward
[2:21:17] <blackkanye> 'Ah shit' LUL
[2:21:23] <%Skelegroove> Wesker was almost a straight upgrade aside from the regular injections
[2:21:25] <+evbites> i love pat's shitty villain voice
[2:21:27] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[2:21:27] <chaumiester> Does anybody ever turn out.... okay after injecting themselves?
[2:21:28] <annearkie> its too dark and spooky for chris :(
[2:21:28] <cephas97> he fucking did the parry
[2:21:30] <jimmytwofeet> @Guardiansaiyan what's the name of this dlc pls
[2:21:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BeezusHrist P in PMC means Private BSAA would be government
[2:21:37] <%Garthunox> NOT A HERO SUCKS BRUH

[2:21:39] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[2:21:40] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt You have to go past the guy
[2:21:46] <%cowardman93> Thanks for the HyperReveal @benzell
[2:21:47] <%NopeBadguy> I think you can run past the white molded
[2:21:55] <+lordericter> Or when Salazar turned into a fucking flower
[2:21:56] <%Konquerer> to be fair though someone must be into the irving monster
[2:21:58] <KaiserMario> ye
[2:22:01] <%DensityD> HyperLost
[2:22:02] <+evbites> @chaumiester jill and sherry
[2:22:03] <%ScottishMadJacko> Dont recall, havent played it after beating it the first time
[2:22:03] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah give me some of that sexy teleporting wesker poison
[2:22:04] <Phoenon> Man First Person Chris just isn't as effective as Third Person Chris
[2:22:05] <%penitentpentwitch> Punch and run past him, I think?
[2:22:05] <rytisone> it's a bit counter intuitive
[2:22:05] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Skelegroove and that only happened in RE5, before that he only weakness he had "ah no, I don't like fire that much"
[2:22:14] <Guardiansaiyan> @jimmytwofeet not a hero DLC
[2:22:15] <%cowardman93> if Irving gave up and didn't go flesh beast Wesker's plan would've worked
[2:22:16] <jimmytwofeet> could someone tell me the name of this dlc please?
[2:22:16] <Sapphire_Breeze> so yeah, Wesker had the best version of it
[2:22:16] <Aydarkzero> cum zombies
[2:22:20] <chaumiester> I honestly don't understand. Why does Chris run into every situation with just a pistol and basic equipment
[2:22:24] <%NopeBadguy> it's a devil triggered molded
[2:22:25] <blackkanye> Oh shit I didn't even put that together
[2:22:26] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Just like you, white and crusty. <3
[2:22:27] <Huntercd> So naked?

[2:23:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt because you are Irving
[2:23:21] <+Grandnatics> You do a pretty mean Alex Ashford
[2:23:25] <brachydios777> I hear Roxo the rock and roll clown
[2:23:25] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt Slowbeef wants to know your location
[2:23:29] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt Pat, IO've never had more appreciation for you than now
[2:23:29] <%cowardman93> you can do a fairly good ashford
[2:23:33] <Nickdick96> is Irvin the african boat man?
[2:23:33] <%Solid_Stro> How’s your Wesker impression?
[2:23:34] <Aydarkzero> i dunno i always though Salazar was silly
[2:23:35] <fairore> Steve?
[2:23:39] <Phoenon> Remember how Chris could go 1v1 against a majini with a chainsaw with a knife
[2:23:41] <%Meekest> Idk there might be stupider
[2:23:41] <Mechazoic_Era> THE stupidest?
[2:23:42] <rytisone> he's a man with StAnDaRtS
[2:23:45] <fairore> @nickdick96 yes
[2:23:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I'd be that zombie that is quiet and get to bite one of the protagonists
[2:23:48] <Aydarkzero> @Nickdick96 yes

[2:34:46] <LordZazas> The correct answer is NANOMACHINES
[2:34:54] <chaumiester> Has there ever been a simple Assassination attempt against the Redfields, Kennedy, and or Jill Valentine.... Something that didn't involve. Bio weapons and an extra stupid plot
[2:34:55] <chhdez> 10 gam gams?!
[2:34:58] <cephas97> makes the game so much cooler
[2:35:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> You can technically beat this without night vision right/

[2:36:04] <PhantonBat> I love how Ethan needs to push that for ages to get it moving and Chris just boots it
[2:36:07] <Guardiansaiyan> @evbites yes
[2:36:07] <+SH1NK1R0> I mean entire bio terrorist attacks have amounted to assassination attempts against the main cast

[2:39:15] <chaumiester> It's.... honestly going back to Pat's point. A bunch of dudes with Guns..... something simple. But it's always bio weapon.... or long intricate plot/trap

[2:39:52] <PhantonBat> Phrasing
[2:40:00] <chaumiester> I guess..... in one of the RE movies. They tried to chaingun Leon down in a cafe. I guess that sorta counts

[2:41:50] <KaiserMario> That was Crazy Talk Requiem
[2:41:50] <rytisone> you mean EW1
[2:41:52] <%Jekado> i oddly was thinking about that scene when you were doing this
[2:41:52] <dinnydanny777> Why is Lucas fine with this so long as you don't pick up your squadmate
[2:41:59] <PhantonBat> Pat...we are all literally talking about that in chat
[2:41:59] <Captain_Doomsday> It's the biggest not-a-hero time.
[2:42:00] <+spaghetti_shaman> Pat are you excited for new Pinball Killer in DbD
[2:42:04] <$Rashnam> I remember that. It was a fantastic moment.
[2:42:06] <%anticrust> it was 2
[2:42:07] <+lordericter> got a lot of rammable rods
[2:42:12] <dinnydanny777> Why does Lucas only try to kill you when you pick up your comrade
[2:42:15] <%anticrust> pats right (for onece)
[2:42:20] <Aydarkzero> a glorious moment
[2:42:28] <chaumiester> Chris is dumb.........
[2:42:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> In Sonic 2 the game also glitched because of crzy talk
[2:42:45] <%Shadicara> Least he got over people dying
[2:42:53] <Captain_Doomsday> Individually you're ultra-boned near him.
[2:42:58] <brachydios777> Is Lucas the most evil RE villain?
[2:42:58] <DSD24> They have mask so they won't have to lip synch
[2:43:01] <rufus2k2> walking like he fell on his keys

[2:43:18] <+lordericter> gooey
[2:43:19] <chaumiester> Seriously Blue Umbrella..... Send in more then one guy. Stop sending just Chris
[2:43:22] <%DappercatEsquire> i think Chris is just have mini alcoholic amnesia episodes between these deaths, he made them a lot quicker
[2:43:23] <Aydarkzero> what are Crazy Talks stats?
[2:43:24] <heartlesshealer> !
[2:43:25] <SpaceGuntank> 99% of the people that work with Chris die horribly. its just hilarious at this point.
[2:43:27] <+amaranthos> you pop it
[2:43:27] <+evbites> How did you get this comm
[2:43:28] <DSD24> Chris didn't actually do anything there
[2:43:30] <%mikessdd> Chris is Mad at Mia for dead guys confirmed
[2:43:33] <annearkie> You guys? I don't think he's getting tired of playing games...\
[2:43:36] <+Espadadegusto> Sooo.. how did that man didnt notice the necklace rigged with bomb.
[2:43:37] <heartlesshealer> Paige is here
[2:43:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt HI PAIGE we are about to fight lucas and jack again
[2:43:41] <+evbites> oh right he has the helmet
[2:43:46] <PhantonBat> It's more than 3
[2:43:46] <%ScottishMadJacko> I thought those were blue umbrellas men?
[2:43:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> POP
[2:43:48] <Aydarkzero> 10 minutes monkaS
[2:43:51] <chaumiester> At least the BSAA gave them battle buddies
[2:43:51] <%asgard147> RUN PAT!
[2:43:52] <%penitentpentwitch> Chris: "Lucas, your face is looking awful boulder-like right now."
[2:43:59] <rytisone> of course Chris gets the timer
[2:44:00] <%DappercatEsquire> @chaumiester based on the survival rates, maybe they should ONLY send Chris
[2:44:11] <$joylent_blue> who's WE, CHRIS? EVERYONE'S DEAD
[2:44:11] <$Vineslop_Tod> @PatStaresAt See this is why Chris kills Mia and Ethan in the trailer for RE Not 8. Gotta kill his teammates before his enemies do.
[2:44:12] <dinnydanny777> Lucas is kind of a lame villain ngl
[2:44:16] <%afronooch> meth juice
[2:44:18] <Captain_Doomsday> He was a douchebag on his own merits.
[2:44:22] <AFlyingTaco1> So why didn't Lucas just detonate Chris' bomb?
[2:44:27] <%Shadicara> Truly an american hero
[2:44:29] <+kikanshat0masu> Imagine if the dlc was all shadow puzzles
[2:44:36] <dinnydanny777> Lucas is like super non threatening
[2:44:40] <%ScottishMadJacko> I cant wait for paige to see joe
[2:44:41] <haitakaa> he was doing experiments on grandma for the company
[2:44:42] <%DappercatEsquire> oops all shadow puzzles
[2:44:42] <chhdez> Clancey!
[2:44:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> NEW LORE FOR PAIGE
[2:44:47] <Captain_Doomsday> The greatest hero of them all, Action Man.
[2:44:47] <robo_badger> Chris ain't scared of no mold
[2:44:54] <brachydios777> Chris is COD man
[2:44:59] <annearkie> he's da jokah, babyy
[2:45:01] <brambobelurkin> is it uncle Joe time?
[2:45:07] <cephas97> pat, grenades stun the big guy so you can punch him
[2:45:10] <chhdez> Smart juice
[2:45:10] <chaumiester> @DappercatEsquire It seems so far. 1-3 people. Okay, people will survive. 3+.... highly likely chance everyone will die
[2:45:12] <%Skelegroove> Blue umbrella is just a front so they can gain BSAA's trust before killing them
[2:45:16] <+D00msDayDan> heat the key
[2:45:18] <+amaranthos> protip: never actually stick your hand in liquid nitrogen
[2:45:19] <%Shadicara> Ice solves all bio problemw
[2:45:20] <Captain_Doomsday> Chris is stronger than COD. He can survive direct rocket hits and punches boulders.
[2:45:22] <%penitentpentwitch> "Punch the ice to freeze the bomb"
[2:45:26] <%SaiyanShoto> I want Joe and Jack to be in the next Marvel vs Capcom
[2:45:26] <%gespenst25> Heat the bomb. No wait
[2:45:26] <BurdRightsActivist> BEST AIM NA
[2:45:27] <PhantonBat> Step 2. Freeze the key
[2:45:34] <rytisone> do it like in Lethal Weapon 2
[2:45:35] <dinnydanny777> Is Chris's gun supposed to be silenced?
[2:45:42] <BallerSwagBro9k> CHRIS COULDVE WON WW3 ALONE IN MW
[2:45:44] <chhdez> Blue umbrella is save the people but experiment on the monsters
[2:46:00] <%DappercatEsquire> @chaumiester yeah it's a pretty bad gig with a high turnover rate
[2:46:01] <AFlyingTaco1> @dinnydanny777 Bo they just designed it funky
[2:46:01] <rufus2k2> no just an extended barrel
[2:46:04] <%mikessdd> Chris would punch all the russians
[2:46:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> Pat the scavenger
[2:46:05] <AFlyingTaco1> *No
[2:46:13] <+spaghetti_shaman> When will you be on the Dick Masterson show with Paige?
[2:46:20] <DSD24> We will keep the cursed name though
[2:46:31] <%Skelegroove> They still made Evie though
[2:46:32] <lordchum1150> Has he played through joes fists of ultimate justice again yet? Or is he just doing the main story
[2:46:35] <%penitentpentwitch> Chris and HUNK would have a real awkward conversation
[2:46:43] <Captain_Doomsday> Don't forget the RAMRODS are equipped now
[2:46:47] <haitakaa> more like cumbrella
[2:47:00] <brachydios777> Is Hunk still alive?
[2:47:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Skelegroove No Evie is made by someone else
[2:47:04] <+amaranthos> nice
[2:47:08] <dinnydanny777> I like how they kept the name as if people wouldn't immediately be distrustful towards organization called Umbrella
[2:47:13] <+PulleylubeTW> hunk never dies
[2:47:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> @brachydios777 He cannot die
[2:47:17] <PhantonBat> It's especially weird that they keep the name after Neo Umbrella attacked the whole world like 4 years before this game
[2:47:21] <chaumiester> Oh yeah. There is also Chris' ridiculous background. Wasn't he a Captain in the USAF at 21 or something ridiculous
[2:47:22] <chhdez> Numbrella
[2:47:24] <rufus2k2> hunk is immortal
[2:47:35] <dinnydanny777> Who did the attack in 6 anyway
[2:47:40] <MonstarGrrrl> steroids POG
[2:47:41] <AFlyingTaco1> @chaumiester I think it was like 17 or 18
[2:47:45] <%Meekest> Chris needs those to live
[2:47:45] <%penitentpentwitch> There is no canon end for HUNK, so most fanon has him retired to an island somewhere
[2:47:48] <+evbites> i like to think one guy in umbrella was just like dude our company does what i just make cough drops
[2:47:49] <Aydarkzero> is this a boss fountain?
[2:47:51] <DSD24> They should have been called Parasol

[2:51:29] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt You can crouch to dodge his horizontal splurges
[2:51:35] <%AncelDeLambert> now, how often do you have to weaken the boss with the special gun?
[2:51:43] <%AncelDeLambert> not very, I see
[2:51:47] <%Shadicara> Grenade punch
[2:51:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Skelegroove Nope Ethan knew nothing of MIa's job. Actually I dont think we ever know Ethans job....which could be interesting in th e future
[2:51:55] <%penitentpentwitch> To the moon!
[2:52:01] <$joylent_blue> the fact that it backflips is way too goofy lookin'

[2:52:13] <BurdRightsActivist> PHASE THROUGH THE BOXES YEAZH
[2:52:15] <dinnydanny777> Did he just punch that thing through the air
[2:52:15] <%Manwad> do you think, because it's a mold monster, it's actually light for its size and that's why chris can shoryuken it with ease
[2:52:17] <%AncelDeLambert> this isn't a real RE boss fight, where are the eyeballs?
[2:52:18] <cephas97> you can parry all attacks in this game and take no damage
[2:52:22] <haitakaa> God I hope Chris turns into a werewolf in village
[2:52:24] <chhdez> Backflipping is essential to reduce fall damage
[2:52:26] <%penitentpentwitch> The belly bump of doom
[2:52:40] <BluBox> Who needs a samurai edge when you have an uppercut like Chris?
[2:52:42] <%AncelDeLambert> high speed attache case action, folks
[2:52:47] <annearkie> I love how the actual weakness of this boss isn't the bullets that are specifically engineered to destroy, and is actually just letting chris get a couple swings in
[2:52:50] <lordchum1150> I really hope Ethan is just a normal dude who just happens to have all minds of crazy stuff happen around him
[2:52:56] <dinnydanny777> I hope they bring back Jake's dumb martial arts for 8
[2:53:02] <@SoFarFetched> that's cause chris' fist is filled with steroids.
[2:53:04] <%penitentpentwitch> What feelings would you have if Ethan kills Chris at the end of RE8?
[2:53:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @lordchum1150 I mean, his wife is like CIA and he's something similar
[2:53:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> @haitakaa Chris refuses to die until his sister ins impregnated by a warrior of justice LUL

[2:53:44] <%AncelDeLambert> push WALL to continue boss fighting
[2:53:47] <+Espadadegusto> @penitentpentwitch , if like the passing of the torch kind of action, maybe. But unsure.
[2:53:47] <DSD24> This should freeze your arm
[2:53:48] <%AncelDeLambert> uhhhhhh
[2:53:49] <chhdez> If old boxers can knock out dumbasses with a single punch, chris can kill monsters with it too, belieeeve it
[2:53:50] <%AncelDeLambert> why
[2:53:51] <dinnydanny777> Shouldn't that destroy his hand?
[2:53:53] <%Skelegroove> Ouch
[2:53:56] <spongeofmystery> That's hi hand gone
[2:53:56] <%M4T1A5> never put a glove inside liquid nitrogen
[2:53:58] <$joylent_blue> RIP HAND
[2:53:59] <dinnydanny777> Shouldn't his hand shatter?
[2:53:59] <%Meekest> Just like that lady from Friday the 13th
[2:54:00] <%Solid_Stro> And his arm would be fucked
[2:54:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> GOODBYE HAND
[2:54:00] <%DappercatEsquire> i mean say goodbye to that hand
[2:54:05] <%xcompleasedad> IT'S A BOMB
[2:54:05] <%AncelDeLambert> explain to me how any of that works
[2:54:09] <@commanderclaw> Yes and no, gloves protect from N2 pretty well
[2:54:10] <%xcompleasedad> WHAT ELSE CAN HE DO
[2:54:14] <Aydarkzero> it's padded guys don't worry Kappa
[2:54:14] <%AngriestAngryArtist> and his arm GONE! LOL
[2:54:14] <%ScottishMadJacko> Thank god his gloves were thick
[2:54:17] <rufus2k2> REEEEEEEE DIE CHRIS
[2:54:19] <SainEdge> i mean he has a bomb on his arm, not many options
[2:54:20] <+amaranthos> it's just you and me and my crippling frostbite
[2:54:21] <%cellularmishap> good ole frostbite
[2:54:21] <+Dunnesparce> IRL what would that have done to his hand? Completely frozen it?
[2:54:25] <PiotrRasputin> Chris put his hand in their with no hesitation.
[2:54:27] <annearkie> bombs get sleepy when they're cold, we all know this
[2:54:28] <%ClutchRoadagain> "Loocus?"
[2:54:28] <%maskofmichael> Why didn't Lucas put the bomb around Chris's neck?
[2:54:30] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt How many coins you got? I think you missed one in the main room
[2:54:30] <AFlyingTaco1> No guys it's fine. Chris trained his arm to survive by punching boulders
[2:54:33] <Guardiansaiyan> @AncelDeLambert Plot armor with a side of side-effects from Weskers STARS health benefits
[2:54:33] <%ClutchRoadagain> He totally said that like a caveman
[2:54:34] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, I've worked with LN2 a lot, and I ahve no clue wtf that was supposed to do
[2:54:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> HIS BODY HEAT MUSCLES PROTECTED HIM
[2:54:38] <+Espadadegusto> Nope, if its long exposure then it would solidify, but thats somewhat short of time that it didnt freeze instantly
[2:54:39] <chaumiester> You would get some gnarly ice burns
[2:54:43] <Nickdick96> @Dunnesparce instantaneous severe frostbite
[2:54:43] <spongeofmystery> Hand wouldn't shatter, just all the nerves would be dead permanently
[2:54:46] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> there's. no. time
[2:54:46] <%penitentpentwitch> @Espadadegusto They've mentioned before how they want 'younger protagonists' so that'd be one way to do it. Could easily be done badly though
[2:54:46] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Dunnesparce depends on the glove material
[2:54:49] <Captain_Doomsday> Chris got beat on by Wesker, a little frozen hand won't hurt him.
[2:54:50] <shruke> I think the glove would actually protect him a good bit
[2:54:51] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @maskofmichael Couldn’t fit it around.
[2:54:52] <chhdez> @maskofmichael He'd just dip his head tbh
[2:54:53] <Aydarkzero> the roids protected him from the cold
[2:54:58] <%Manwad> chris' hands are mostly callous from the boulder punching, it's fine.
[2:54:58] <$joylent_blue> maskofmichael because shut up that's why
[2:54:59] <dinnydanny777> Chris is lucky none of those Mold monsters left him with any open wounds for that to get into
[2:54:59] <%Solid_Stro> That Redfield bloodline is strong
[2:55:00] <+evbites> @maskofmichael Too WIDE
[2:55:01] <%madskull456> Chris's inner goku saved him
[2:55:01] <Guardiansaiyan> Wesker Vacinated Chris against broken bones
[2:55:04] <+Espadadegusto> Tis true
[2:55:08] <%asgard147> Antique coins? limesPoggers
[2:55:10] <ha2ken> The real question is if Chris has a Heat mode
[2:55:19] <+evbites> Roids
[2:55:21] <%anticrust> DROGS

[2:55:22] <BurdRightsActivist> STEROIDS
[2:55:29] <+evbites> no the meme
[2:55:30] <%Typhaeon> Fake Chris confirmed
[2:55:30] <%DappercatEsquire> not playing Chris in character
[2:55:32] <%penitentpentwitch> Chris has enough Roids in his life

[2:55:34] <rytisone> thats not chris way

[2:56:24] <LordOfThePoultry> so when was all this shit built?

[2:56:39] <@commanderclaw> I love that it's been long enough for Pat to only half remember this shit

[2:56:48] <%SwdVengeance> Knockoff Fallout Vault
[2:56:49] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe there's a coal mine around here somewhere
[2:56:52] <dinnydanny777> How do Lucas's family not know about this shit anyway
[2:56:54] <%penitentpentwitch> You'd think a mine wouldn't be viable in a swamp
[2:56:56] <brachydios777> @anceldelambert Got a thing for gas masks?
[2:57:01] <dinnydanny777> I assume he's been doing this for a while
[2:57:02] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, it's the wrong type of excavator for coal, but fuck it I'll take it

[2:57:42] <rytisone> yeah, who could punch the molded?
[2:57:45] <Aydarkzero> at this moment Lucas is looking up Chris on the internet and realized he made a mistake
[2:57:46] <dinnydanny777> @ballerswagbro9k So he set up this entire lab after the family get infected?
[2:57:46] <%NopeBadguy> won't chris have to burn this suit with the amount of mold it's been in contact with after the mission
[2:57:49] <Captain_Doomsday> Why is the limbless attack scary when Regeneradores do it but lame here?
[2:57:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @chhdez Tali IS my waifu

[2:57:52] <+spaghetti_shaman> Why didn't Umbrella invent a virus that prevents you from pooping?

[2:58:42] <BurdRightsActivist> @spaghetti_shaman They did. It's called a Colostomy Bag. None of the umbrella agents use it because it can be a targeted weakpoint

[3:05:53] <cephas97> HES PLAYED THIS DLC ALREADY
[3:05:56] <%AncelDeLambert> is it because they gave up on animating you?

[3:06:54] <T_Sasquatch> Is it weird i don't see this game as an RE game

[3:07:02] <ReNhoSoft1> remember kids, theres no problem steriods cant solve
[3:07:08] <%AncelDeLambert> I just assume that grate was bolted down and he kicked it out like Batman
[3:07:13] <DSD24> Why didn't you confirm the kill
[3:07:17] <chhdez> @ReNhoSoft1 Junk shrinking
[3:07:18] <dinnydanny777> Is this supposed to be scary btw?

[3:07:38] <+The_Protagonist> He's working with.... scrumbrella
[3:07:38] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt Chris' survival instincts are fueled by the desire to shoot Mia in a black trench coat
[3:07:41] <%JumboCrunchies> This part isnt, no.
[3:07:42] <%AncelDeLambert> god, if there was anything I would change about Arkham Asylum, it would be getting the fuck rid of the QTEs for the grates
[3:07:43] <Wobuzhidao> no this is just boulder punching chris mode
[3:07:46] <%ClutchRoadagain> Swamp lab
[3:07:47] <%Shadicara> Nice lab

[3:08:12] <brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 Supposed to be like re4 , re5 in tone I think
[3:08:14] <%penitentpentwitch> Credit to the construction company that built this lab in the swamp
[3:08:15] <lilichar33> probably not someone important
[3:08:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:08:21] <%M4T1A5> How did Lucas build this lab
[3:08:23] <Captain_Bear_Mode> LUL
[3:08:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> Man I want Wesker back

[3:08:28] <rufus2k2> Alfley Alford
[3:08:29] <SpaceGuntank> a lab, under a mineshaft, under a swamp. classic.
[3:08:32] <LordZazas> This is how they re-canonize him

[3:08:47] <dinnydanny777> How do you keep the swamp water out of the laboratory anyway
[3:08:52] <%penitentpentwitch> Welbert Asker you say?
[3:08:55] <+evbites> This area makes no sense
[3:08:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> FALCO.....PAWNCH
[3:08:56] <devanmuse> do you think this area was supposed to be in the base game but got cut for time?
[3:09:08] <heartlesshealer> more item there?
[3:09:09] <rufus2k2> SNITCHES GET STITCHES
[3:09:11] <lilichar33> random umbrella dude: I've had enough of this dude
[3:09:12] <PiotrRasputin> Who the hell would promote Lucas to anything.
[3:09:13] <$joylent_blue> yeah how'd that go
[3:09:17] <heartlesshealer> unless it's an empty drawer or something
[3:09:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The lab is a salt mine, not a swamp
[3:09:26] <Captain_Bear_Mode> Im sure that went great
[3:09:31] <Aydarkzero> what a nerd
[3:09:31] <%Solid_Stro> If my position was taken by a guy like Lucas, I’d be pissed too
[3:09:33] <@commanderclaw> I love the idea of going to MIT or some shit and then going into Bioterrorism
[3:09:34] <%Meekest> Shoot him RIGHT NOW
[3:09:34] <lilichar33> im suprised lucas has a job
[3:09:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> probably pays in bitcoin
[3:09:36] <+The_Protagonist> "there's no power" all the lights and computers are on
[3:09:37] <%madskull456> he keeps putting mold samples into my sandwich

[3:09:45] <%stabbityrabbit> I'm glad that even Not!Umbrella hates him.

[3:13:28] <rufus2k2> Why, Sheva carried his ass all through 5?
[3:13:28] <%RueOrin> Implying Wesker wasn't always a stupid villain
[3:13:28] <%mikessdd> wesker is so lame/cool/badass/lame/cool
[3:13:29] <BallerSwagBro9k> NO BEST VILLAIN
[3:13:31] <dinnydanny777> are the molded people, I forgot
[3:13:32] <heartlesshealer> nice
[3:13:32] <@commanderclaw> Or that woman that Wesker can't remember
[3:13:33] <+lordericter> Chris should work with Jill or Sheva
[3:13:33] <+PulleylubeTW> wesker obv had a hannibal/will relationship with chriss
[3:13:36] <%Dementedpenguin> Jill fell out of a window when she teamed up with Chris >_>
[3:13:36] <chaumiester> His partner from RE5 is technically alive
[3:13:41] <spongeofmystery> It's how Wesker makes egg mayonnaise sandwiches, with CRESSSSSSSS
[3:13:44] <%mikessdd> Wesker is bester
[3:13:44] <+evbites> Remember when wesker was explain the tyrant and chris just laughed at him\
[3:13:45] <%walternatorz> Target lost.
[3:13:47] <rufus2k2> like every QTE in RE5 is chris getting his ass kicked and saved by Sheva
[3:13:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Chris should work with Joe Baker
[3:13:50] <+SH1NK1R0> I dunno sheva was helpful
[3:13:50] <SainEdge> nah thats when he was the best villian
[3:13:50] <%Meekest> What about Piers
[3:13:52] <+Grandnatics> How many ram rods does Chris have?
[3:13:55] <heartlesshealer> did anything even happen to Sheva? Did she die offscreen for working with Chris?
[3:14:00] <dinnydanny777> Isn't Jill the strongest human being in the world?
[3:14:04] <rufus2k2> Chris: LOL
[3:14:06] <%stabbityrabbit> Only Jill has the big dick energy to survive being on Chris' team.
[3:14:15] <%Alopekis> Chris is the ultimate bio weapon
[3:14:19] <brachydios777> @heartlesshealer She is super still alive

[3:14:26] <Guardiansaiyan> @heartlesshealer Sheva is just chilling killing umbrella and clones
[3:14:35] <%Samurai_Mak> punch the boulder
[3:14:38] <%afronooch> You STEAL mens MOLD
[3:14:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> is that why they got the information?
[3:14:40] <BurdRightsActivist> Wesker is that kid in class who's desperately trying to seem cool and impressive to the people who bullied him a year ago. That's why he wears sunglasses
[3:14:42] <heartlesshealer> @brachydios777 @Guardiansaiyan Nice
[3:14:43] <%ClutchRoadagain> Wesker, for as cool as he presents himself to be, gets the dorkwinkle treatment so hard.

[3:32:22] <+not_draven> this sounds like mario music
[3:32:31] <%penitentpentwitch> Easy to fail
[3:32:31] <$joylent_blue> SourPls
[3:32:32] <STINKerton22> you need to get him to throw you through a wall to gain access to secret location
[3:32:35] <lilichar33> mmm good glass
[3:32:55] <STINKerton22> no
[3:32:56] <%miguelrod777> where are they getting this food from anyway
[3:33:03] <rytisone> that's a lie
[3:33:13] <%Alopekis> There
[3:33:18] <$joylent_blue> chat's just havin' a giggle
[3:33:23] <$joylent_blue> as they do
[3:33:28] <%Alopekis> No giggles here
[3:33:34] <brambobelurkin> 10s per shot
[3:33:35] <%Alopekis> I haven't giggled in 27 years.
[3:33:36] <black_pariah> looks like if you give him 3 plates of spiced chicken, it'll fill him up almost all the way
[3:33:57] <chhdez> Woooohoooo
[3:33:58] <%walternatorz> is it possible to feed jack bullets?
[3:34:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Spice. Dune.
[3:34:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Arrakis
[3:34:15] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Man the south sure is a wacky place
[3:34:17] <brambobelurkin> spice gardbage
[3:34:17] <+DiabloDeAzul> You should use the item box more to store spices
[3:34:17] <@SoFarFetched> does pepper count as bullets LUL cause you can feed him straight pepper
[3:34:19] <zeroskub> Desert Planet
[3:34:20] <PhantonBat> If you don't get Jack his food, he's gonna put you through a fuckin' wall!
[3:34:22] <chhdez> Feed him some chipotle
[3:34:25] <%Alopekis> You have to satiate Daddy's hunger, Pat.
[3:34:28] <%NovaKnightmare> the music makes me think of Disneyland
[3:34:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Not enough WutFace
[3:34:32] <lil_drummer2552> Is the blue blaster supposed to be a loose megaman reference?
[3:34:33] <+DukeBlack_> reset
[3:34:34] <black_pariah> never mind all the other stuff, just run right to the spices and chicken
[3:34:39] <%AncelDeLambert> nice aim, chief
[3:34:49] <+shocknawful> but why is fire?
[3:34:50] <%AncelDeLambert> this dlc makes no sense
[3:34:55] <%afronooch> ew
[3:35:00] <%GhostThane> sugar in water
[3:35:04] <%walternatorz> ask Paige for some sugar
[3:35:06] <%Alopekis> This DLC makes more sense than any of the other DLC
[3:35:12] <%AncelDeLambert> chimkin
[3:35:16] <%maenos2> First you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women
[3:35:19] <+OwlLightningMage> This DLC is the only sense
[3:35:21] <brambobelurkin> @GhostThane put the sugar. in the. water
[3:35:32] <chhdez> More
[3:35:47] <dinnydanny777> Can you feed Jack Bugsnax?
[3:35:50] <zeroskub> I combine sugar with garbage every day of my life Kapp
[3:35:55] <$autcetera> Makes Twinkies?
[3:36:00] <%Alopekis> Bugsnax Jack
[3:36:00] <%GarbageNirvana> That's American cuisine for ya, am I right fellas
[3:36:03] <brambobelurkin> The sugar show?
[3:36:16] <+evbites> BUGSNAX IS A JOE THING
[3:36:26] <@commanderclaw> Pour some sugar on Pat
[3:36:35] <Hirschensky> what are little girls made of?
[3:36:35] <STINKerton22> its bugsnax!
[3:36:40] <%Alopekis> Sugar with garbage is a Southern staple.
[3:36:56] <zeroskub> The football helmet increases the Molded sexiness by a huge factor.
[3:36:58] <+wmeldrum> Joe Baker is the bugsnax we made along the way
[3:37:00] <+shocknawful> always assume chat is bullshitting
[3:37:03] <black_pariah> 2 spiced chicken and two wine seems to be the fastest strat to fill him up
[3:37:10] <Drusain> Sugar's not in the first level
[3:37:13] <rytisone> sugar is probably in the later stages
[3:37:37] <brambobelurkin> double or triple chicken
[3:37:41] <+NitronStreams> So the garbage is just garbage?
[3:37:42] <STINKerton22> What is a trick, but a mere gamer treat?
[3:37:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:37:48] <+not_draven> re2 make could have used something like this

[3:37:58] <Hirschensky> combine it with me, call it a girlfriend
[3:38:00] <%GhostThane> garbage is just garbage until later level with sugar yeah
