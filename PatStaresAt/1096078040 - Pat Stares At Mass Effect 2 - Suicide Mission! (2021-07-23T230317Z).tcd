[0:08:53] <%jackelzxaa> Hi pat hope you dont accidentally suicide mission your channel again :<
[0:08:57] <TrollKing96> My granddad is doing the suicide mission right now.
[0:08:57] <+Ipsenscastle> Is Sexy Beasts what it sounds like it is? :(
[0:09:02] <%ssjklyco> Ultrawide or just regular 27"?
[0:09:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> The 70" isn't big enough?
[0:09:22] <%bread_assassin> Then where would we go?
[0:09:23] <%Ranryu692> and then WE will be the TV
[0:09:27] <%AyotoCorp> Does this mean the return of LoL
[0:09:29] <%JoshManVGH> Oh no then it will look like pat is staring at us all the time
[0:09:29] <rekinom> Why did Capcom make that Cat in Stories 2 breedable
[0:09:30] <%Rumbutt> and if you do that then chat goes on the tv and becomes SUPER psaBig
[0:09:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Sweet
[0:09:35] <%morningmoondude> so with fuck-assy games us in chat would be living in the OLED?
[0:09:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh, like the Dark Souls 2 damage bar @PatStaresAt
[0:09:38] <dekkitout> The ones that just so happen to come from eastern europe
[0:09:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Strain those eyes for our entertainment
[0:09:47] <%GabeSweetMan> @PatStaresAt What do you mean you can't read this 14 pt Helvetica from 20 ft away?
[0:09:50] <%jackelzxaa> Dragon Age Origins on the table?
[0:09:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why tho?
[0:10:01] <+pr_illuminati> game text size is 100% the biggest shared issues among PC games right now imo
[0:10:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dark Souls 2 HP bar LUL
[0:10:13] <%polothegreatest> it looks nice but cant read sht LUL LUL
[0:10:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, I had to get a UI mod for DAO
[0:10:28] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I still don't see the big appeal for 4k yet. I just have a regular 1080p 144hz monitor.
[0:10:32] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Dead Rising 1 has text, but only as a joke
[0:10:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Text size as a slider option needs to become standard.
[0:10:40] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt It's been like that since the beginning of 4k
[0:10:43] <guiltyboya> crystaEvil
[0:10:44] <dekkitout> Any game that isn't made for the lcd is likely to have monitor intended ui

[0:11:58] <%polothegreatest> yeah no, tekken has 60fps but 720p? horrible
[0:12:02] <+FennecZephyr> My main point of wanting a 4k monitor is that I can't use my steam link to stream games to my TV at 4k without one

[0:31:54] <%Daxalog> Wickid
[0:31:55] <dekkitout> Ah dang, they use a proprietary driver
[0:31:57] <spongeofmystery> The Geth are orders of magnitude better than the Quarians, which makes certain decisions in ME3 extremely easy to make
[0:32:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Logical.
[0:32:05] <%Daxalog> 0 vs 1's
[0:32:05] <dukenux> "Hypocrite that you are..."
[0:32:06] <jorniev> 0 1

[0:32:47] <Profmcstevie> All geth would love Reapers
[0:32:48] <%MugenSandan> could it have something to do with the fact that LEGION IS THE COOLEST
[0:32:48] <Saffry_Ruzin> The Geth in ME1 ARE pretty curvy...
[0:32:49] <AllenDeadman> yeah that virus has to GO
[0:32:53] <peachy996> Don't worry there's one regardless!
[0:32:54] <+BigBruthaThunda> there's no difference

[0:32:54] <Mattais88> Mordin's is pretty up there

[0:36:12] <+AmericanSkidd> neat
[0:36:13] <SovPho> Oh you mean the model of having people submit copyrighted works to your stream for you to publicize to thousands of nonpaying consumers isn't smart or sustainable?

[0:38:45] <%teefpal> as a programmer this shit is nonsense and I love it
[0:38:46] <+AmericanSkidd> they downloaded BIGPORNZ
[0:38:48] <%RealThiele> DDoS the space station
[0:38:59] <%Wurmspawn> Why would a space ship have windows? To see a ship that hides its emitions and em field to make it undectable to sensors.
[0:39:05] <%NopeBadguy> i feel like an engineer Shep shoulda understood that
[0:39:05] <%Shubreaker> "ugh gotta clear these recycle bins'

[0:39:33] <peachy996> No. Blow up their dyson sphere Tali
[0:39:33] <dukenux> Wololo.exe
[0:39:35] <AllenDeadman> shut th efuck up
[0:39:35] <mattynezz> Nope
[0:39:36] <stantheman_97> brainwash or slaughter
[0:39:38] <tlflordhand> Gethware > Bioware clearly ,nigga
[0:39:40] <%RealThiele> maybe if stop trying to genocide them babe
[0:39:40] <Tracazoid> "We can rewrite them to accept our Vtuber overlords"- Legion after downloading all the 21th century human achieves
[0:39:41] <dukenux> Wololo .exe
[0:39:43] <mattynezz> You literally can't
[0:39:46] <Tracazoid> archieves*
[0:39:51] <+trackles_64> paragon?
[0:39:53] <%JoshManVGH> Man DC Douglas is so cool as a robot
[0:39:55] <%NopeBadguy> we already did tali's mission right
[0:39:55] <%robuttastic> why must qw decide the races future
[0:39:59] <$SGrim> Brainwash vs. Murder.
[0:40:01] <+Vigonept> brainwash brainwash
[0:40:02] <%JohnAtDawn> ITS NOT
[0:40:03] <dukenux> nah
[0:40:04] <%AncelDeLambert> except they're not biological
[0:40:04] <+Cactuskris> it is not
[0:40:05] <%JohnAtDawn> WTF PAT
[0:40:07] <%RealThiele> unethical
[0:40:08] <Meltgar> BRAINWASH or GUN TO THE HEAD Kappa
[0:40:09] <+trackles_64> its not
[0:40:10] <%JamesCorck> If you blow them up, it makes a pivotal mission of ME3 much easier.
[0:40:10] <kirk_vander> NO
[0:40:12] <Teras_ode> I love the renegade option in this
[0:40:14] <%robosqueeb> the game prefers murder
[0:40:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> ITS NOT PAT
[0:40:16] <+trackles_64> the game wants murder
[0:40:18] <+AmericanSkidd> I wouldnt do it to an organic
[0:40:18] <Mattais88> Game says brainwashing is immoral
[0:40:19] <%JamesCorck> the game actually rewards you for just blowing them up.
[0:40:19] <peachy996> Brainwashing is a nice alternative to murder yes
[0:40:19] <Dunmarkh> fixing bugs is unethical
[0:40:20] <+Cactuskris> better die than to live a slavew
[0:40:21] <%miguelrod777> killing them gets better chance for peace
[0:40:21] <+DatAsuna> It's not, but the game says it's paragon
[0:40:21] <+SilverDevilfish> Murder is the correct choice for ME3 points
[0:40:22] <%Torus1025> If they're not already brainwashed it's pretty fucked
[0:40:22] <tattleworm> legion explains if you bring it up
[0:40:23] <%teefpal> Geth in the ME1 ME2 era were actually alien and interestign
[0:40:23] <nyacoo> wololo
[0:40:24] <%Monkeyweed21> Legion outright says you cant judge it by organic standards
[0:40:24] <%Ranryu692> it isn't brainwash, it's fixing a computational error
[0:40:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> They're software, I doubt they mind the rewrite
[0:40:25] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat blowing them up can lead to a payoff in me3
[0:40:26] <dawarw0lf> Oh yeah Pat is control all the way
[0:40:26] <kirk_vander> Pat goes full Mordin.
[0:40:27] <sendart> rewriting is wayvworse
[0:40:30] <%Wurmspawn> Why would HHH have an opnion on this?
[0:40:31] <mattynezz> The game thinks it's less evil to rewrite, as it makes peace easier
[0:40:34] <%Ranryu692> it's a cure
[0:40:36] <Dunmarkh> woolie being a game tester was basically genocide
[0:40:37] <jorniev> yay
[0:40:38] <%RealThiele> they made the decision to follow the reapers
[0:40:39] <dukenux> deleting mind's content is essentialy s kill
[0:40:40] <+Scevda> Eugenics or nah?
[0:40:40] <%JohnAtDawn> GEE WONDER WHY
[0:40:42] <leinadtonu> rewriting them is the same as killing them, tho.
[0:40:42] <dawarw0lf> It’s been like 3 weeks
[0:40:42] <teridax4> More dead quarians
[0:40:43] <dekkitout> Given that there's a dialogue prompt saying it's a slippy-slope....
[0:40:45] <Profmcstevie> I knew he'd forget
[0:40:46] <%ssjklyco> It's been 2 weeks total
[0:40:48] <buhbuhboat> Missed out on a cool Legion line
[0:40:48] <AllenDeadman> wellp
[0:40:49] <GuyverTypeL> just remember you can repukken people
[0:40:51] <%Ranryu692> @Dunmarkh LUL
[0:40:53] <jorniev> 3 WEEKS?
[0:40:58] <AllenDeadman> time to restart
[0:40:59] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt which would you prefer if you were one of those Geth? Would you want to die or literally have your opinion changed by a virus?
[0:41:01] <%RealThiele> BIOTIC CHARGE BAYBEEE
[0:41:09] <kirk_vander> It was their free will and conclusion to follow.
[0:41:10] <+Scevda> 9 playthroughs
[0:41:12] <dukenux> this choice is whatever youre less queazy with
[0:41:14] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt these Geth made a choice to follow the reapers. Legion says they weren't indoctrinated, so you're taking their free-will.
[0:41:14] <Vikingincognito> You could argue they have already been brainwashed by the Reapers. Who's to say that the new conclusion they came to isn't the Synth version of indoctrination?
[0:41:15] <%robuttastic> Are we playing ME3 right after suicide tonight?
[0:41:18] <stantheman_97> i would say it's the same because they're essentially dead either way. it's just a difference between ego death and actual death
[0:41:21] <nyacoo> I can't believe it's been 4 weeks
[0:41:22] <%JamesCorck> I'd rather die, honestly, before getting brainwashed.
[0:41:24] <%teefpal> Opinion changed = worse than death
[0:41:25] <SivShele> you're talking to the guy that would rather be a toilet than die
[0:41:25] <+Cactuskris> becoem a toilette or do as I say
[0:41:27] <+Vigonept> id rather be alive to see that opinion changed
[0:41:27] <+AmericanSkidd> oh right that is the pat stance
[0:41:29] <%Ipsenscastle> Pretty confused that some of chat seems to think murder is the lesser of these two evils
[0:41:29] <%bread_assassin> The "points" you get from destroying the geth can easily be made up by doing a single side quest in 3 and picking the appropriate option. It's really not that big a deal.
[0:41:30] <Profmcstevie> both are death of the self
[0:41:30] <Dunmarkh> @robuttastic no we have the dlc
[0:41:32] <%walternatorz> UPGRADES
[0:41:36] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat blowing them up contributes to a payoff in me3
[0:41:37] <%RealThiele> i mean they fought a war to stop the quarians from doing just that
[0:41:38] <The7thCrownLessKing> cbt?
[0:41:39] <tlflordhand> Logic fail, geth dont die just get uploaded until new body
[0:41:42] <%AncelDeLambert> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:41:42] <%teefpal> The thing?
[0:41:43] <+Scevda> Even toilet robot
[0:41:43] <leinadtonu> But if I stop being me, what's the difference?
[0:41:43] <MexicanMau> but what if your opinion is changed to make death preferable?
[0:41:45] <+trackles_64> lol no faq
[0:41:45] <%JamesCorck> psaGoblin

[0:41:57] <LluthyY> GOBLINS!
[0:41:58] <mattynezz> Opinion MAJORLY changed would be worse, but this is a slight alteration, not total brain jacking

[0:42:00] <Teras_ode> AWAKEN MY GOBLINS
[0:42:00] <dawarw0lf> @mattynezz actually in 3 it’s bad to rewrite as Quarians don’t like it
[0:42:00] <%saadi90> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:42:02] <ahaegotrigger> lmao
[0:42:02] <%AJ_Cherenkov> AJ_Cherenkov subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! I was gonna say, you don't remember how to keep people alive in suicide mission?
[0:42:03] <+condemned_15> GOBLIN ATTACK
[0:42:03] <dukenux> Opinion changed = getting owned. id rather choose death
[0:42:05] <%Monkeyweed21> oh thats a really good one
[0:42:14] <dekkitout> This is gonna watch weird after seeing the "Prove to the court I am sentient" clip
[0:42:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> If they were kicking and screaming about being rewritten, sure, that's a dilemma; but if it's just "oh we believe this now, okay", then that's probably fine
[0:42:25] <%teefpal> @dukenux embrace your cringe, be free
[0:42:29] <dawarw0lf> Peace in 3 is easier to obtain if you kill the Geth
[0:42:32] <Vikingincognito> The change in calculation could just be software indoctrination. There is no way to know for sure
[0:42:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> fine being relative
[0:42:39] <Profmcstevie> Aim for the wi-fi
[0:42:48] <%RealThiele> comcast effect
[0:42:55] <%ahomeschooldropout> Are we doing DLC tonight?
[0:43:00] <rekinom> -explosion- "we have been detected"
[0:43:04] <+Cactuskris> I did everything renegade and still got peace with screaming at people in 3
[0:43:11] <Teras_ode> "fuckers interuped my torrent"
[0:43:19] <+ultimafullmetal> Perhaps we can think of rewriting the error as forcefully medicati g
[0:43:22] <mattynezz> Geth are so cool
[0:43:22] <%ssjklyco> It's a Robot Sex chamber
[0:43:27] <+Vigonept> converting cultist away from their evil outer gods is "evil"
[0:43:29] <mattynezz> Too bad they get kind of lame in 3
[0:43:34] <+AmericanSkidd> Geth are extroverts
[0:43:36] <%JoshManVGH> so singularly
[0:43:46] <%AncelDeLambert> and then those Geth platforms insist they're Sovereign Citizens and everything goes to hell
[0:43:51] <%teefpal> "remember when we were cool and different? now ewebady has a sowl and is metal ppl" - geth
[0:43:52] <dukenux> it's like WE are Legion or sth
[0:43:58] <%DarkJaguar124> Me like bots.
[0:44:01] <wolverinewaswrong> Way better than 3 or 1
[0:44:03] <%JoshManVGH> So singularity in a computer sense would be crushing to geth
[0:44:03] <%CatastropheCorvid> Legion, what about YOUR CURRENT perspective? Does that persist?
[0:44:14] <+Scevda> Geth is so awesome
[0:44:18] <mattynezz> "But if we ever got upgraded, all this cool stuff would go away, because that's how every other story goes"
[0:44:19] <+senfood> HELL YEAH TIME FOR SUICIDE
[0:44:21] <SaltyAzteca> They just get used to it
[0:44:21] <%AncelDeLambert> they're basically a hive mind, and the heretics are REALLY close to being a cancer
[0:44:24] <%teefpal> ?
[0:44:24] <+AmericanSkidd> so easily
[0:44:27] <%Shubreaker> NO REWRITE THO
[0:44:30] <AllenDeadman> well shit
[0:44:34] <sirrice77> but that will make peace harder in 3
[0:44:35] <kirk_vander> Death.
[0:44:37] <dukenux> Okay, so both choices are morally fine i guess
[0:44:38] <+Cactuskris> yes it is the only way
[0:44:38] <kirk_vander> Kill them.
[0:44:39] <Goraka91> They made their choice, they get the consequences
[0:44:39] <+Scevda> Wanna try?!
[0:44:40] <wolverinewaswrong> assuming direct control?
[0:44:41] <Aiutare47> So uh, does the rewrite play into 3?
[0:44:42] <tlflordhand> According to the Saren book geth traumatized but bioware retcon that lel
[0:44:43] <heartlesshealer> :)
[0:44:45] <Aiutare47> I thought it did
[0:44:47] <+Cactuskris> death over rewrite any day
[0:44:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> what? I wasn't paying attention
[0:44:47] <$LightningLynx89> Death to Geth!
[0:44:54] <sirrice77> i actually don't know if its needed though
[0:44:55] <+black_pariah> i hate bioware walk and talk, use better camera angles rather than characters making random motions
[0:44:56] <+AmericanSkidd> its fine they are not geth
[0:45:00] <dawarw0lf> @cactuskris It’s less about being paragon or renegade but choosing charm/itemadate options
[0:45:01] <%Wurmspawn> Chat, let him live wiht his choices, this is why he's going to be playing ME3.
[0:45:04] <%DarkJaguar124> LUL
[0:45:06] <SaltyAzteca> Geth to Death! wait...
[0:45:07] <peachy996> Overrite the drones like you should overrite the Geth
[0:45:08] <+fetrigon> smart
[0:45:18] <%RealThiele> what a hero
[0:45:23] <+fetrigon> running all cylinders here
[0:45:26] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Smrt
[0:45:27] <stantheman_97> the geth are so cool and legit one of the best ideas for a synthetic race
[0:45:31] <%bread_assassin> @Aiutare47 Rewriting makes peace slightly harder to obtain and you get less resources from the Quarians but more from the Geth.
[0:45:35] <dawarw0lf> With how Pat plays he’ll be fine no matter what choice he makes
[0:45:37] <Mattais88> Nope, glass is a weakness
[0:45:40] <Dunmarkh> pat wants the reapers to win so he can be an immortal husk
[0:45:41] <%teefpal> Playing this as a kid was the highlight of my gaming childhood
[0:45:43] <%RetroCop87> Is chat being pissy because Pat chose choices they don't like?
[0:45:47] <%RetroCop87> good, stay pissy
[0:45:51] <dukenux> honestly, id pick whatever Legion would suggest. he prolly has better grasp on it than any organic
[0:45:52] <%Shubreaker> T
[0:45:56] <%RealThiele> B O P
[0:45:56] <%Ipsenscastle> this ethical debate seems kind of redundant when half your party members use skills like AI hacking and Dominate
[0:46:03] <peachy996> Neither choice matters in 3 anyway
[0:46:06] <+AmericanSkidd> cuz why would they need gravity
[0:46:15] <peachy996> So piss is at a minumum for me
[0:46:26] <dukenux> ALERTA
[0:46:26] <heartlesshealer> Legion Love Pathing
[0:46:29] <+Cactuskris> @dukenux the thing is he dosen´t know he says it liek 50% to 49%
[0:46:30] <dawarw0lf> @dukenux It’s said later it’s 571:573 in terms of what he thinks
[0:46:39] <Blank9> shepard even is a synthetic
[0:46:44] <+PharosOfLight> what use do Geth have for medkits?
[0:46:47] <%Solid_Stro> Smooches the Robit
[0:46:48] <%DarkJaguar124> She can join in
[0:46:50] <dukenux> @dawarw0lf good, pick 573
[0:46:51] <%psidefx> LUL
[0:47:07] <mattynezz> Medgel heals Legion, so...
[0:47:10] <dawarw0lf> @dukenux Then it’s rewrite
[0:47:11] <peachy996> @PharosOfLight That's....don't worry about that
[0:47:13] <ape_hawk> im always bigger when im on top
[0:47:17] <%Ipsenscastle> no problem Pat
[0:47:20] <Saffry_Ruzin> They use the medigel for lube
[0:47:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Did we kill Jacob yet?
[0:47:25] <PanicSwytch> Chat has become..BIG
[0:47:30] <%JoshManVGH> "Yo, Tali, wanna have a three way with this here vacuum cleaner!?
[0:47:31] <%RealThiele> easy when bigger :)
[0:47:35] <dukenux> @dawarw0lf i think thats what ibpicked
[0:47:35] <peachy996> Legion is a special platform for the geth
[0:47:38] <+HefestoForges> embiggened
[0:47:40] <+fetrigon> glad to be of use
[0:47:41] <knight_verse> @blank9 Correction: He is partly synthetic, but is mainly organic, EDI says this in ME3.
[0:47:50] <tlflordhand> Those turrets are same ones from kotor just slightly changed LUL
[0:47:53] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt That a single slug shotty or a pump shotty?
[0:48:06] <+Scevda> I still think you sit too close to the Tv. You often dont notices things that pass by on the corners
[0:48:18] <dukenux> Wasn't Shep always a cyborg
[0:48:25] <+Cactuskris> legions mind is hive mind geth software but when he is out of reach he develops a self
[0:48:27] <%AJ_Cherenkov> there are slug shotties in me3
[0:48:29] <ExpressNode> Playing my switch in handheld for the first time in a long while. Not as bad as I thought but I have a early model with the weak battery
[0:48:33] <+AmericanSkidd> Ok so, Tali, or Legion with "Hardware Attachments"?
[0:48:38] <%Solid_Stro> To pump up the jam
[0:48:41] <%RealThiele> Pump Kreygasm
[0:48:46] <+Cactuskris> whait so is my dads with a poacemaker a cyborg too?
[0:48:48] <%JamesCorck> Assimilate this.
[0:48:50] <Vikingincognito> Actually Pat, Soldeirs have mucles and bone implants put in them by the alliance
[0:48:53] <dukenux> like didnt they get some implants upon joining the military
[0:48:55] <SaltyAzteca> See deez nuts Geth
[0:48:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gotta love that biotic charge. Best move in the franchise
[0:48:57] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @AmericanSkidd somehow, I don't think legion would be interested regardless
[0:48:59] <Mattais88> Nova is so much fun in ME3
[0:49:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is there a threshold of robo-parts you need to be a cyborg or does anything do it
[0:49:02] <tlflordhand> No, biotics don't need to be cyborks
[0:49:14] <TrollKing96> I thought Biotics were just super psychics?
[0:49:15] <+Cactuskris> I will make them pay for what they did - in tank top
[0:49:19] <%machshop> EZClap
[0:49:29] <$SGrim> @AmericanSkidd I'm having an orgy every time I fuck Legion, but Tali got the Qussy.
[0:49:30] <+Scevda> One could argue the distinction between being cyborg and just being cybernetically enhanced.
[0:49:30] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @TrollKing96 they have control implants for the biotics
[0:49:33] <Vikingincognito> Biotics are space radiation mutants. Soldiers are the Cyborgs
[0:49:34] <+Cactuskris> biotics have a brain implant
[0:49:36] <homestylewaffles> @TrollKing96 they have implants that allow that
[0:49:40] <dukenux> Biotics usually have an implant to help them with biotic powers
[0:49:46] <tlflordhand> Miranda tells you as such implants or genetic purification
[0:49:46] <kirk_vander> Everyone in Mass Effect tends to be a gene-modded or implant-filled beast.
[0:49:48] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[0:49:51] <%psidefx> NICE
[0:49:56] <%HotSauceFiend> do the powerups carry over into the me3?
[0:49:57] <%robosqueeb> well earned
[0:49:58] <$SGrim> Playing as intended, not as designed.
[0:49:59] <+AmericanSkidd> @AmericanSkidd As an organic learning experience
[0:49:59] <%RealThiele> thanks Krogan Vitality
[0:50:00] <Profmcstevie> """"Genuine"""" success
[0:50:01] <Mattais88> Humna biotics at least, Asari are just naturals
[0:50:05] <Vikingincognito> wow pat
[0:50:13] <Teras_ode> biotics cybernetics are more like a microchip at the back of the head, not a full on cyborg thing
[0:50:17] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Why would they have audible alarms?
[0:50:18] <$StrawberryPantsu> You cheated not only the game, but yourself. You didn't grow. You didn't improve. You took a shortcut and gained nothing. You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained. It's sad that you don't know the difference. Kappa
[0:50:24] <+Scevda> Im worrying about ir
[0:50:25] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @HotSauceFiend no, just alingment points and some xp
[0:50:26] <+Soliloquy123> Why would the geth need an alarm noise tho
[0:50:27] <+condemned_15> yeet
[0:50:35] <dukenux> Would you rather get augmented or be a genetic freak, if you lived in ME verse
[0:50:36] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[0:50:39] <%teefpal> @StrawberryPantsu cope
[0:50:49] <%DarkJaguar124> They're dog legs
[0:50:50] <%RealThiele> gimme those cyborg parts fuck yeah
[0:50:53] <buhbuhboat> Need to let intruders know they've been spotted

[0:50:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Futaba?
[0:50:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> good one pat
[0:50:59] <%psidefx> Froppy
[0:51:01] <$SGrim> Froppy!
[0:51:02] <+ScrapKingKeita> Tali is a Space Wyverian
[0:51:02] <%NitronStreams> Froppy
[0:51:02] <GuyverTypeL> mmmm quarian feet
[0:51:02] <peachy996> She is a dweeb
[0:51:03] <SovPho> atsui tsuyu? froppy?
[0:51:05] <%Solid_Stro> She’s Froppy
[0:51:05] <Sunstalker> As Neil Armstrong?
[0:51:06] <%RealThiele> undyne
[0:51:06] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You fucked those frog feet Pat
[0:51:07] <+Urgotfantasy> froppy :)
[0:51:07] <heartlesshealer> ...
[0:51:08] <%teefpal> the my hero academia girl?
[0:51:08] <$StrawberryPantsu> @teefpal /woosh
[0:51:10] <+Cactuskris> she would cosplay as the flotilla girl with sheppard as the turian hot guy
[0:51:10] <tlflordhand> Because level design, gotta have an audio que for the most oblivious lel
[0:51:10] <peachy996> This is true
[0:51:11] <dawarw0lf> I wonder what difficulty Pat will choose in 3. Normal is technically casual in 3z
[0:51:14] <%Ranryu692> Pat did you know that the season is ongoing?
[0:51:20] <%Shubreaker> wait are krogan battlemasters natural biotics or implant modified
[0:51:22] <%Solid_Stro> Call her Tsu doodStare
[0:51:22] <Mattais88> I love the line where tali asked why you have so many fingers, and isn't it hard to not get them in the way
[0:51:22] <%HotSauceFiend> so this is like the borg
[0:51:25] <dukenux> Pat, pls, Tali and Froppy together is too much
[0:51:36] <%Wurmspawn> That's also a great analogy line.
[0:51:37] <PanicSwytch> Froppy is best gurl
[0:51:55] <+Scevda> You do know that your leg bones curve too Pat
[0:51:57] <%RealThiele> they hacked our codewalls!
[0:52:00] <+AmericanSkidd> Legion sounds so betrayed
[0:52:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Geth are on some Brave New World shit. Disgusting
[0:52:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> Isn't the whole deal with Asari that they know other peoples minds?
[0:52:10] <+Urgotfantasy> I love how expressive Legion is
[0:52:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> NOT ANYMORE
[0:52:16] <dukenux> Geth know no SUS
[0:52:19] <+Cactuskris> a litany of blood wow
[0:52:21] <+wizard_of_diamonds> THANKS REAPERS
[0:52:24] <+trackles_64> consensus of genocide?
[0:52:26] <SaltyAzteca> NOO SAD LEGION
[0:52:28] <dukenux> that alrrady makes their existence superior
[0:52:28] <%RealThiele> until now
[0:52:28] <%machshop> perhaps we are not so different
[0:52:29] <dawarw0lf> It ok legion
[0:52:30] <%teefpal> Wow THIS IS TIMELY

[0:53:09] <peachy996> lmao
[0:53:09] <+Cactuskris> can let the data mix
[0:53:09] <%Monkeyweed21> thats not how that works pat
[0:53:10] <SaltyAzteca> This is it
[0:53:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> keep the ick out the good brains
[0:53:11] <%bassforte123> It's a bit interesting though contrasting with their "We with to develop in our own way" mentality
[0:53:12] <heartlesshealer> wow pat
[0:53:15] <%AncelDeLambert> (X)
[0:53:16] <dawarw0lf> Actually yes
[0:53:18] <%nichos7> That's not really how that works
[0:53:20] <+lag2993> but then your infecting the good brain
[0:53:20] <%Garthunox> Pat, you want to rewrite them, trust me
[0:53:21] <GuyverTypeL> C O N S E N S U S
[0:53:24] <%JamesCorck> It literally is the moral thing to do.
[0:53:25] <Dunmarkh> based moral bug testing genocide
[0:53:27] <Teras_ode> murder good
[0:53:28] <dukenux> correction: its not amoral
[0:53:30] <dawarw0lf> Kill the Geth before they gain souls
[0:53:30] <tattleworm> rewriting the geth means more dead quarians, so it's actually the moral thing to do
[0:53:32] <+Scevda> Gotta keep your gussy intact
[0:53:32] <$BoneWheelSkeleton> I'd like to replay this series, but I am physically unable to play RENEGADE, so it'd be the same goody-two-shoes run FeelsBadMan
[0:53:32] <heartlesshealer> saying that the geth have organs. Pretty rude
[0:53:35] <tlflordhand> Kill em all, let geth sensus sort em out later
[0:53:37] <dukenux> *immoral, sorry
[0:53:40] <+fetrigon> this is the weirdest git merge command ever LUL
[0:53:43] <%RealThiele> they made their choices, you can take it from them sure i guess but mehhhh
[0:53:49] <%AncelDeLambert> never allow differing opinions, annihilate all who disagree
[0:53:51] <%KishinGrek> good ol legion and hot Russian space chick
[0:53:52] <dukenux> its actually pretty amoral, by the organic standards
[0:53:57] <Dunmarkh> you can hack these
[0:53:57] <+lag2993> its not because by murdering them you change the good guys to be bad because the accepted genocide
[0:53:59] <peachy996> @tattleworm More dead quarians is....bad?
[0:54:06] <peachy996> I dunno about that
[0:54:09] <nyacoo> Have a problem? Just kill it!
[0:54:29] <%Theycallmenerf> Theycallmenerf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 19 month streak! I got tired of waiting to see the suicide mission so I got through it myself and now I’m in ME3.
[0:54:36] <+Cactuskris> dont be sad about the ships tali it´s like firworks - pat in me3

[0:54:45] <dawarw0lf> “No matter what you do what makes the Geth as individuals dies” samara
[0:54:47] <%HotSauceFiend> Wow they melted those turrets fast
[0:54:47] <Saffry_Ruzin> "Start your Upload" Uh oh, indirectly and unintentional foreshortening spotted
[0:54:49] <%machshop> weeeeee
[0:54:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> those turrets did literally nothing lmao
[0:54:53] <kirk_vander> Kill them with their ideals or make these into something they are not.
[0:54:55] <dawarw0lf> Both are morally grey choices
[0:55:05] <+Soliloquy123> @PatStaresAt Did you see that Amazon's MMO is apparently bricking people's 3090s
[0:55:06] <%AncelDeLambert> speaking of tower defense, apparently Orcs Must Die 3 is out today
[0:55:06] <Mattais88> When I did this, I actudentlly shockwaved one up to the rafters and couldn't advance until i found it and killed it. took five minutes
[0:55:09] <tlflordhand> Anyone keeping a death tally on Pat's play through? :D
[0:55:11] <dukenux> morally colorless
[0:55:15] <%JamesCorck> Pat, what's your current level?
[0:55:15] <%AncelDeLambert> I didn't even know they were working on an OMD3
[0:55:17] <Teras_ode> oh we are getting suicide mission OST early
[0:55:23] <%teefpal> @kirk_vander If you do that youll have more of your own people
[0:55:26] <kirk_vander> Many Batarians.
[0:55:28] <+lag2993> its not just 3090 its mostly evga cards
[0:55:32] <%HotSauceFiend> Bro-Bot
[0:55:35] <%Wurmspawn> ASSUMING Control..
[0:55:37] <%XeroRaizer> yoooo i made it in time
[0:55:38] <%Monkeyweed21> HE SAID THE LINE
[0:55:40] <dekkitout> He said the thing, Shepard
[0:55:50] <%Theycallmenerf> Also I did Arrival for the first time and damn.
[0:56:03] <Saffry_Ruzin> The suicide Mission battle music is actually part of Tali's theme apparently
[0:56:15] <Teras_ode> funny thing, both legion's and tali's missions share some soundtracks, including a version of this one
[0:56:21] <SaltyAzteca> PULL!!!
[0:56:22] <%AncelDeLambert> "I'm nOt gOnnA nEeD THesE"
[0:56:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Saffry_Ruzin Tali was the final boss of Mass Effect all along
[0:56:42] <dawarw0lf> Of course, your on baby normal
[0:56:48] <%teefpal> I thought this theme was exclusive to the suicide mission
[0:56:50] <+lag2993> tali is the secret hitler
[0:56:56] <Saffry_Ruzin> Tali is Canon romance confirmed
[0:57:11] <peachy996> it's 4am and you just woke them up with gunshots, you be effective at your job
[0:57:14] <+lag2993> i thought canon was garrus and tali
[0:57:25] <teridax4> RU gonna do Shadow Broker and Arrival this stream?
[0:57:27] <Mattais88> How wierd is it that Liara is the canon romance?
[0:57:28] <%Garthunox> REWRITE
[0:57:30] <+AmericanSkidd> fuck em
[0:57:32] <Saffry_Ruzin> Liara is Bioware's Canon one
[0:57:34] <%DarkJaguar124> Rewrite
[0:57:38] <+Scevda> Imagine if the mobile platforms all uploaded and attacked simultaneously.
[0:57:43] <tattleworm> absolutely rewrite
[0:57:45] <%RealThiele> BOOM
[0:57:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> YES
[0:57:56] <%cvp5127> he likes you
[0:57:57] <%HotSauceFiend> So is Tali the voice of reason in this?
[0:57:58] <%AncelDeLambert> not really, he's huge conflicted
[0:57:59] <+abrupt_abe> He does idolize you
[0:58:02] <+AmericanSkidd> He looks up to him
[0:58:02] <%Ipsenscastle> he's a super fanboy though
[0:58:04] <+Cactuskris> lie
[0:58:06] <SovPho> I don't think he necessarily trusts like a human trusts.
[0:58:07] <%DarkJaguar124> Legion is like your son so....
[0:58:07] <ahaegotrigger> I mean he sees you as a hero so maybe
[0:58:09] <%AncelDeLambert> there, see?
[0:58:09] <Profmcstevie> I think you're SO COOL I'll let you decide my peoples fate
[0:58:10] <%teefpal> Its the core conceit of the entire series
[0:58:12] <%Solid_Stro> He’s a fan boy,
[0:58:15] <spongeofmystery> @teefpal To be fair, the part of the Suicide Mission this track plays on is during the steam valves section, which (before Kasumi) the correct team members to use are Legion and Tali
[0:58:16] <MidnightPacif1c> his trust is.... binary
[0:58:16] <SaltyAzteca> Rewrite sounds good
[0:58:19] <Mattais88> Not really hes a huge enough fanboy to use your armour as a patch
[0:58:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Mattais88 Not that weird? I mean, I romanced her. It'd be weird if it was like, Morinth or smthn
[0:58:21] <kirk_vander> Liara thematically is the better romance. Tali in terms of character though.
[0:58:21] <%RealThiele> until the next time they use it
[0:58:26] <peachy996> well then rewrite
[0:58:26] <nyacoo> but how does liking work if chemicals aren't real
[0:58:28] <AllenDeadman> KILL
[0:58:28] <+Cactuskris> kill
[0:58:29] <KetsuoTaberu> make that 574
[0:58:30] <%crazyspartan214> Rewrite
[0:58:30] <%cvp5127> geocide it is
[0:58:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> PARAGON OR RENEGADE
[0:58:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Rewrite really is no more unethical than deletion
[0:58:32] <%ssjklyco> "Here's the Robo A bomb. Use it once but no copies"
[0:58:35] <%Solid_Stro> Son is asking dad for permission
[0:58:36] <$SGrim> It is safer to kill them.
[0:58:37] <peachy996> 573-571 isn't a split decision
[0:58:38] <dawarw0lf> Choose what you want pat
[0:58:38] <+lag2993> is brainwashing better than murder
[0:58:40] <%HotSauceFiend> but they;re robots
[0:58:41] <%AncelDeLambert> they don't HAVE lives, they're program fragments
[0:58:43] <vendervic> KILL
[0:58:43] <%robosqueeb> makes you no better than sovereign
[0:58:45] <RaidenRising> rewrite
[0:58:45] <teridax4> KILL
[0:58:45] <Goraka91> Those Geth chose to follow Sovereign, they get what they fucking deserve
[0:58:47] <%bhp_99> rewrite
[0:58:48] <tattleworm> not really
[0:58:48] <dukenux> Well, it's not that ridiculous from his standpoint. it's just different means to an end. the ramifications are much more dramatic for the organics
[0:58:48] <%AncelDeLambert> but they're a minority
[0:58:48] <+Scevda> Awesome
[0:58:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> FUCK EM.
[0:58:50] <+lag2993> how your rewritting them
[0:58:51] <%JamesCorck> Blowing up the base makes a ME3 mission easier.
[0:58:51] <Ardailec> Poor Legion is playing Disco Elysium on Ultra Hard mode.
[0:58:52] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Liara is bae for me
[0:58:52] <+tinytinykittycat> KIL
[0:58:53] <%Monkeyweed21> thats not how that works
[0:58:54] <%HotSauceFiend> but wouldnt that be solved by re--writing them?
[0:58:56] <%morningmoondude> KILL
[0:58:58] <%Solid_Stro> CONVERT OR DIE sabert14Gun sabert14Gun sabert14Gun
[0:58:58] <+JaseAdrift> KILL
[0:59:00] <%animaturgy> Rewrite!
[0:59:00] <+lag2993> this is basically two forms of genocide you monster
[0:59:00] <%trianglehat> rewrite
[0:59:01] <SaltyAzteca> They will be perfectly fine with rewriting
[0:59:01] <%viewtifulr> more war force
[0:59:04] <%teefpal> The entire series is about you deciding the fate of entire species single-handedly. The devs fucked it up, but that was the intent.
[0:59:04] <%nichos7> No it doesn't
[0:59:04] <%AncelDeLambert> and it's a pretty minor rewrite
[0:59:05] <%JamesCorck> If you blow this base up, you'll have an easier time during a part of ME3.
[0:59:05] <+fetrigon> majinoSkiip fuck em
[0:59:06] <%barrakuta371> rewrite!
[0:59:06] <peachy996> fucked up decisions will be made regardless
[0:59:06] <vendervic> K I L L
[0:59:07] <+BigBruthaThunda> u really don't need to overthinking this
[0:59:07] <AllenDeadman> I geth are not like liquied
[0:59:09] <%Garthunox> Killing em makes the geth strength weaker in ME3
[0:59:09] <Teras_ode> brainwash good? LUL
[0:59:10] <Blank9> surely it is more ethical to kill
[0:59:11] <LluthyY> It dont work like that really lol
[0:59:12] <Sunstalker> But they could learn from those mistakes too
[0:59:12] <tattleworm> rewrite gets you more geth troops and fewer quarian ones in 3 so it's objectively good
[0:59:13] <dukenux> Yea but you rewrite them
[0:59:14] <%machshop> mercy kill
[0:59:16] <rambling_madman> K I L L
[0:59:16] <%Ipsenscastle> it reintroduces them to the collective, not necessarily their conclusions
[0:59:16] <Tracazoid> "Indoctrination is good"- Legion, probably
[0:59:16] <teridax4> Destroy them
[0:59:19] <%Theycallmenerf> Rewrite ;D
[0:59:21] <+Rikufmix21> boo
[0:59:22] <mr_saturday93> BAD CHOIE
[0:59:23] <%strakillias> Burn purge kill
[0:59:25] <Wydamn> technocide
[0:59:25] <Josef_Stryker> Kill them
[0:59:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> RENEGADE
[0:59:26] <%cvp5127> tali goes sploosh
[0:59:26] <%trianglehat> fair reasoning
[0:59:27] <%HotSauceFiend> Tali Fist pumps in the background
[0:59:31] <%faintsmile> welp thats not as good for me3
[0:59:31] <Goraka91> Killing is more ethical than brainwashing tbh
[0:59:35] <+JaseAdrift> BIG MURDER
[0:59:36] <%AncelDeLambert> OH MAH GAHD METROID
[0:59:36] <+AmericanSkidd> Death to the Heratics
[0:59:37] <+lag2993> oh well you corrupted the geth cant wait till they do the same to humies
[0:59:38] <KetsuoTaberu> PLUS THIRTY
[0:59:38] <%andrewofbob> Free to DIE
[0:59:39] <kirk_vander> Best Renegade Decision.
[0:59:40] <%JamesCorck> That was the right choice!
[0:59:40] <spongeofmystery> Krush Kill N Destroy
[0:59:41] <rambling_madman> Killing gives a point towards Peace in 3, it's good
[0:59:42] <%AncelDeLambert> DAMN YOU MOTHER BRAIN!
[0:59:43] <%Solid_Stro> Tali is so horny right now
[0:59:44] <%nichos7> What happens is that more geth exist in 3, when all of them ally with the reapers
[0:59:45] <%Ancopro> oh no now WE genocide the geth
[0:59:45] <Meltgar> PAT, you Can't CALL THEM THAT Kappa
[0:59:46] <+GobbleLynn> no it doesn't pat it completely overrides their logic... you'll see later I guess?
[0:59:47] <dawarw0lf> Kill the Geth before they are good
[0:59:47] <$LightningLynx89> Right choice
[0:59:47] <%Ranryu692> big renegade
[0:59:48] <peachy996> This decision is pointless in 3
[0:59:49] <%Monkeyweed21> cool Pat made the racist choice
[0:59:49] <+Cactuskris> true
[0:59:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Tali and Liara are both super hot tho. I refuse to romance any of the other chicks. Garrus and Wrex are bae
[0:59:51] <%teefpal> - Hitler
[0:59:53] <%RealThiele> its want the heretics wanted: freedom of choice isnt freedom of responsibility
[0:59:53] <%JamesCorck> You'll be happy when you reach one of the parts in ME3.
[0:59:55] <%NitronStreams> Agree to disagree
[0:59:55] <%HotSauceFiend> THE MIGRANT Fleet will REMEMBER that
[0:59:57] <Dunmarkh> pat had a gamer genocide moment
[0:59:59] <jorniev> DID THEY? WASNT IT A VIRUS?
[0:59:59] <%bevyrage> it honestly is real fucked that paragon is the jedi bullshit brainwashing method
[1:00:03] <ToneBacas> that's a huge bitch
[1:00:04] <%machshop> LUL
[1:00:04] <dukenux> Kill the Heretic, Purge the Unclean
[1:00:04] <Josef_Stryker> It's the right choice in the long run
[1:00:07] <Wydamn> They're not alive in the organic sense, so as an organic you can feel no guilt about it
[1:00:11] <mr_saturday93> i think i remember that in 3 rewriting them doesnt change shit
[1:00:12] <+lag2993> i guess pat was the real secret hitler all along
[1:00:14] <Mattais88> @GarbageQueenEllie Because it always seems like nobody ever chooses her. Like Jacob, if jacob could be bi and in all the games.
[1:00:19] <SivShele> they give you three minutes for a hallway?
[1:00:23] <Blank9> god, 3's gameplay is such a massive step up
[1:00:25] <%polothegreatest> convertion by force or robo genocide WutFace
[1:00:27] <%Solid_Stro> Tali is so wet
[1:00:29] <%teefpal> @GarbageQueenEllie are there even any other reasonable options?
[1:00:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> SMASH CUT
[1:00:31] <Wydamn> wooliePOYO
[1:00:31] <Dunmarkh> you got indoctrinated, time to wipe out your race
[1:00:31] <Saffry_Ruzin> Paragon and Renegade aren't good and bad... until 3 anyway
[1:00:35] <KetsuoTaberu> Legion wears clothes?
[1:00:36] <+condemned_15> LUL
[1:00:37] <dawarw0lf> Now that the decision is made it literally has a net 0 change on the war assets in 3. It only matters if you can’t get peace.
[1:00:38] <Goraka91> Why is Legion so fucking good
[1:00:40] <%machshop> monkaS
[1:00:40] <dd44dostivei> shame they weren't batarians
[1:00:40] <+AmericanSkidd> Apple model Unlocked
[1:00:44] <+JaseAdrift> Tali loves a good murder
[1:00:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I love the rengade resolution to this
[1:00:51] <Saffry_Ruzin> They bangin
[1:00:51] <%morningmoondude> Hi, Heretics! I respect your decision to worship the reapers by leaving your free will, but i'm asserting my dominance as a Spectre by BLOWING YOU TO SHIT
[1:00:51] <GuyverTypeL> Legion in a Tuxedo
[1:00:52] <Profmcstevie> yeyeye
[1:00:53] <Meltgar> RACE WAR LUL
[1:00:53] <+condemned_15> explosion dot wav
[1:00:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Mattais88 I for one believe these types of games shouldn't even HAVE a canon.
[1:00:56] <+Cactuskris> I´ll solve the proble,m by facts and logic
[1:00:57] <%viewtifulr> tali wants it now with all those exploded geth there
[1:00:57] <Tracazoid> So you think you'll make it to Arrival? Pat, or are we leaving off at the end of the Suicide Mission.
[1:00:58] <spongeofmystery> Tali the genocide apologists
[1:00:58] <Goraka91> This filthy fucking Geth looked at me funny
[1:00:58] <Josef_Stryker> In ME3, rewriting the heretics gives the Geth more reinforcements which makes it harder to broker peace with the Quarians
[1:00:59] <%Ipsenscastle> Legion was going through her underwear drawer
[1:01:00] <jorniev> NOW HAVE A THREESOME WITH THEM
[1:01:00] <dukenux> Tali beating Legion with his own arm
[1:01:03] <Teras_ode> Portal turret skin Legion
[1:01:04] <+JaseAdrift> YEEEAH KILL
[1:01:04] <PanicSwytch> Tali knows ur cheating on her with Legion

[1:01:12] <teridax4> U doing arrival and shadow broker?
[1:01:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> RENEGADE CHOICE
[1:01:27] <%faintsmile> tali shut up LUL
[1:01:29] <dukenux> its only logical
[1:01:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn not enough Renegade
[1:01:32] <Tracazoid> "Guys, guys. I'll sleep with both of you."
[1:01:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Stop being racist, Tali
[1:01:32] <%morningmoondude> Why is my little tali so racist?
[1:01:32] <SaltyAzteca> PARAGONITOUT
[1:01:33] <%JohnAtDawn> They walked it back SO HARD in 3
[1:01:34] <%AncelDeLambert> the difference being that Legion is stealing info
[1:01:37] <peachy996> Back off Tali
[1:01:37] <metalsiren31> The Geth LITERALLY did nothing wrong
[1:01:38] <%HotSauceFiend> That Paragon option would never work in real life
[1:01:43] <Wydamn> Legion is morally and logically correct. But Tali's got that ass, though.
[1:01:43] <%RealThiele> legion found the deathstar plans
[1:01:44] <+AmericanSkidd> EVERY TIME
[1:01:44] <+Urgotfantasy> Legion is so right but that wont make her qussy goosh
[1:01:44] <%Dopamien> You're both right EleGiggle
[1:01:45] <+Wolfstriker121> LEGION IS 100% NOT WRONG
[1:01:46] <+Cactuskris> theey will try agaoin
[1:01:47] <%Solid_Stro> TALI, CALM YOUR THIGHS
[1:01:55] <samcast1> oh god
[1:01:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Legion is absolutely in the right
[1:01:57] <Goraka91> MrDestructoid We literally act in self defence every time
[1:01:59] <%dilly2lame> Legion is such a good character, I'm sad we get him so late in the game.
[1:02:01] <+fetrigon> I KNOW???
[1:02:03] <Mattais88> @GarbageQueenEllie You're not wrong. But there's always the question of the supplimental stiff like comics or books that requires a canon pick.
[1:02:05] <%NopeBadguy> I just got back, what did we do with the base
[1:02:05] <Sp3ctre48> it's kinda lame honestly, there's no choice here when the Quarians are always clearly wrong
[1:02:07] <%RealThiele> THEY SHOULD
[1:02:08] <dukenux> it's official, Pat preffera cold robot ass > warm qussy
[1:02:10] <peachy996> "You're both right, but Legion is more right"
[1:02:14] <Meltgar> NOW MAKE UP
[1:02:16] <FassieFons> Quarians are always the aggressor
[1:02:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Mattais88 True. Who did you romance?
[1:02:25] <+JaseAdrift> THE QUARIANS WONT ALLOW THIS
[1:02:26] <+Wolfstriker121> but its all the quarrins fault!!

[1:07:57] <+fetrigon> that's cool
[1:08:04] <%RealThiele> just fill that suit with virophages
[1:08:07] <spongeofmystery> The Quarians, the pandas of Mass Effect. Nature really, really doesn't want them alive
[1:08:09] <+Scevda> ADAPT TO THISK DICK
[1:08:12] <+JaseAdrift> Gotta learn to ADAPT
[1:08:12] <$SGrim> @conchthechimera He's using the rush method to romance her after taking Legion on her loyalty mission.

[1:08:40] <+DatAsuna> race wars be that way
[1:08:40] <+StrikeTheErf> do you know that, or do you gain joy out of pessimism
[1:08:44] <%walternatorz> all their problems get fixed in a generation
[1:08:44] <%HotSauceFiend> Has Paige Cosplayed as Tali yet? Seems like a perfect fit
[1:08:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Or just, y'know, NOT declare war on your roboppl
[1:08:48] <%ssjklyco> I'm surprised out of millions, there aren't some off world Quarians that can survive non suit life.

[1:09:04] <gerryxeszo1> The stubborn stupidity of the Quarians is the most realistic thing about the entire series
[1:09:05] <kirk_vander> It's terrifying how tiny their population is.

[1:09:38] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[1:09:39] <%Wurmspawn> Based on how Tali was describing the situation, It seems like the Quarian homeworld was their ONLY colonized world. The environment provided their people with valuable symbiotic organism that helped them which are now a threat because they haven't been exposed to them for so long.

[1:12:16] <nyacoo> come ooon crazy talk
[1:12:17] <%Wurmspawn> Accordign to the wiki, "Quarian immune systems have always been relatively weak, as pathogenic microbes were comparatively rare in their homeworld's biosphere. Furthermore, what few viruses and other microbes were native to their homeworld were often at least partly beneficial to them, giving them a symbiotic relationship with their environment." So basically their homeworld was the ONLY safe world form them to live on. Once they got kicked off, that was it.
[1:12:17] <Jmann1892> Because Crazy Talk that's why

[1:19:09] <dukenux> did you accidentaly romance Mordin
[1:19:09] <Teras_ode> *is unromanceable
[1:19:12] <Jmann1892> My mom was so pissed when she learned you couldn't fuck Mordin
[1:19:13] <kirk_vander> Aint getting in that cloaca
[1:19:15] <Dunmarkh> @dukenux mordin doesn't want to fuck pat
[1:19:15] <+SilverDevilfish> Salarians don't really care about "the fuck"
[1:19:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wait, I thought this was the version where Mordin tells Shep that he doesn't want to fuck them
[1:19:16] <Laecerelius> Get all up in there
[1:19:19] <+Chaos_Aether> did he just.....
[1:19:22] <GuyverTypeL> Waaay up there

[1:19:41] <dukenux> @dunmarkh yeah i know, so what was that about
[1:19:42] <Dunmarkh> @Jmann1892 does your dad look like mordin?
[1:19:43] <%Bailey__gaming> Good luck commander Pat
[1:19:47] <Sunstalker> Mordin needs to save his nut for science
[1:19:48] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt if you have no more missions left, banging will occur directly after talking to her
[1:19:52] <%dilly2lame> did pat get the special hanar fish
[1:20:00] <dukenux> Edit save for Tali
[1:20:02] <+SilverDevilfish> Shut up Joker

[1:20:03] <Jmann1892> @Dunmarkh Nope
[1:20:04] <%Torus1025> Fuck off Joker
[1:20:09] <peachy996> Wait till the next "mission" and try again
[1:20:11] <%AncelDeLambert> god I can't wait for the "crawl" line
[1:20:14] <godila2> uhhh pat didnt get kely to feed fish?
[1:20:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> That's a pretty fucked up thing to say about a crewmate Joker
[1:20:15] <+ScreamLord> The Romance scene with Garrus is hilarious when you have a dozen dead fish floating in your tank
[1:20:15] <+AmericanSkidd> Time for a stupid ass decision by the commander
[1:20:18] <peachy996> The dialogue will prob progress
[1:20:25] <Vantesla> You forgot to talk to Tali after her mission so you are off by one. or just by one mission. been a while
[1:20:25] <+redthebaron> joker hates robots big robotism
[1:20:28] <%NopeBadguy> oh okay so we destroyed the geth base
[1:20:33] <godila2> ohh good
[1:20:37] <+ScrapKingKeita> by it up, do you mean 'the fish?'
[1:20:37] <+ScreamLord> She might fuck the fish
[1:20:40] <+Wolfstriker121> HERE WE GO BOYS AND GIRLS
[1:20:41] <Profmcstevie> She keeps taking her clothes off to feed my fish
[1:20:41] <dekkitout> Or sometimes literally fucks it
[1:20:44] <dawarw0lf> Something tells me she might not be able to do it anywas
[1:20:44] <stantheman_97> she will try to fuck the fish
[1:20:44] <%RealThiele> only when she gets kidnapped
[1:20:48] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Joker was born with glass bones and paper skin
[1:20:52] <%maenos2> CRAM EVERYONE ON THE SHUTTLE
[1:20:52] <+Scevda> No no she fucks the fish
[1:20:54] <Saffry_Ruzin> Shepard does a big dumb because the Squad select screen scares him
[1:20:59] <Teras_ode> does she eat the fish?
[1:21:02] <%RealThiele> HIT THE BUTTON
[1:21:02] <peachy996> Eddie?
[1:21:09] <%Ipsenscastle> Commander Miranda
[1:21:11] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> this is still goofy
[1:21:11] <+DatAsuna> "this one time only we'll take everyone"
[1:21:13] <+JaseAdrift> he said 80
[1:21:14] <conchthechimera> Trying to remember if EDI gets her body in this one or ME3
[1:21:14] <+SilverDevilfish> "Let's take the entire combat portion of the crew away in a shuttle mission" crystaDerp
[1:21:20] <%NopeBadguy> WHAT MISSION IS THIS

[1:21:28] <+BigBruthaThunda> this is fine
[1:21:28] <Mattais88> ME3
[1:21:29] <%andrewofbob> Does the shuttle even seat 13?
[1:21:29] <%teefpal> Fucking dumb
[1:21:31] <%sniffy77> Dont fuck it up joker
[1:21:31] <%miguelrod777> On one small ass shuttle
[1:21:32] <%KishinGrek> KishinGrek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! recently rewatched Soul Eater,(have you heard of it?), there's a huge Twin Peaks reference I overlooked, there's a "heroes mind palace" that looks just like the Velvet Room, the devil living there dances just like the man from another place
[1:21:32] <Josef_Stryker> EVERYONE IN THE SHIP
[1:21:32] <Sp3ctre48> Lets ALL leave the ship for no reason
[1:21:32] <teridax4> Why would they take everyone?
[1:21:33] <dd44dostivei> well this and the suicide mission
[1:21:33] <%Torus1025> Edi gets a body next game
[1:21:33] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> this sequence is still super cool
[1:21:35] <kirk_vander> The Kodiak must be damn crowded.
[1:21:35] <QuestlordJake> squeeze in, gang
[1:21:36] <%AncelDeLambert> she gets her pointless, stupid body in 3
[1:21:36] <$SGrim> Seems like you should leave who you don't wanna take, but what do I know.
[1:21:36] <%GabeSweetMan> ALL THE WARRIORS
[1:21:38] <+Jay_Watching> inb4 big botch suicide time
[1:21:38] <+StrikeTheErf> citadel talks about how they always all go, they're just off screen
[1:21:38] <+tigerfang86> ALL THE PEOPLE
[1:21:38] <+JaseAdrift> WHY IS EVERYONE GETTING IN
[1:21:39] <dawarw0lf> But bad writing doesn’t happen till 3 I thought?
[1:21:41] <+TheotherKristian> its for the drahma

[1:21:44] <oz19999> ALL THE WARRIORs
[1:21:47] <+Scevda> Fucking tight seating room

[1:21:47] <+DatAsuna> reminder: one of the few cool things in andromeda is you fight the final boss with the whole squad at once
[1:21:47] <+BigBruthaThunda> the reaper killer is staying behind tho
[1:21:48] <%machshop> BOOM
[1:21:48] <%Torus1025> Orgy
[1:21:50] <%faintsmile> its so stupid
[1:21:51] <Laecerelius> Every badass into the shuttle, I'm sure nothing bad will happen
[1:21:51] <+SilverDevilfish> With the DLC that's alot of people to cram into that shuttle
[1:21:51] <%bread_assassin> This offscreen mission must be the most intense in the franchise.
[1:21:51] <Dunmarkh> why the fuck did we take jacob
[1:21:51] <%RealThiele> BRICK, SALTY B, OLD SPICE, POWDER
[1:21:52] <+tigerfang86> why IS everyone coming what if they just MURDERED YOU ALL

[1:25:32] <%GabeSweetMan> "I will use this extra processing power to design a porkable body for your benefit later."
[1:25:32] <MexicanMau> EDI is a Dom who love pegging
[1:25:33] <dukenux> Look at you, JOKER, crawling through MY vents...
[1:25:36] <+DatAsuna> man console load times were so bad back in the day
[1:25:39] <kirk_vander> One of two reasons to hesitate on Destroy.

[1:26:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That is going to be a LOT of broken bones
[1:26:24] <peachy996> the joker/edi romance is too weird
[1:26:24] <nyacoo> crunch
[1:26:25] <conchthechimera> She called him Jeff because they finally formed trust
[1:26:25] <%NitronStreams> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL

[1:26:37] <peachy996> Because at this point he starts calling her mom
[1:26:37] <dukenux> They're dead, Jeff. Everyone's dead, Jeff
[1:26:38] <+DatAsuna> his bones are meant to be made of glass
[1:26:40] <%teefpal> That should have shattered every bone in his body
[1:26:41] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking liquefied Jokers brittle bones
[1:26:43] <kirk_vander> Spine destroted.

[1:27:31] <Badgerconda_> and now you're getting yelled at by an australian that only exists because the devs wanted to sculpt a really nice ass.
[1:27:35] <Mattais88> To be fair have you seen cerberus? They die en mass to plant zombies
[1:27:36] <Blank9> it's not his fault, we decided to all leave the ship unprotected at once
[1:27:39] <kirk_vander> The Turian God of Death and War.

[1:28:45] <gerryxeszo1> People make fun of the sexbot body she has in ME3 (rightfully so) but her actual character is totally fine

[1:28:52] <kirk_vander> He most certainly will
[1:28:53] <%RealThiele> meta

[1:28:54] <dawarw0lf> And edi
[1:28:54] <+DatAsuna> ME3 lets you murder a lot of squadmates outright, but miranda's one of the few that can only die tragically
[1:28:55] <peachy996> and Edi
[1:28:56] <%Monkeyweed21> and EDI
[1:28:57] <%Wurmspawn> And feed the fish cause kelly is gone.

[1:29:03] <%walternatorz> EDI conversations
[1:29:03] <+MidnightBurst12> and bone both of them
[1:29:04] <%Ipsenscastle> The fact that Joker's so ripped is really confusing
[1:29:04] <peachy996> You should talk to Edi
[1:29:08] <heartlesshealer> Feed fish
[1:29:11] <TioXyco> time to try and go up that qussy

[1:35:45] <Profmcstevie> My best friend of the war crime varietys
[1:35:46] <%nichos7> Empty vessel
[1:35:46] <%Maids4lyfe> Hey Mordin feels bad about it
[1:35:50] <KetsuoTaberu> I SHOULD GO
[1:35:50] <%bread_assassin> What's a few warcrimes between friends?
[1:35:51] <+Scevda> some nazis were probably pretty cool to get a beer with
[1:35:52] <+ScreamLord> Real Science says Humans and Turians/Quarians can "exchange fluids" with little to no risk. Because DNA Chirality doesn't mean everything in cyanide to the opposite
[1:35:52] <BeastlyWhale> salarians have a deep and rich culture of warcrimes
[1:35:52] <dukenux> Thats rite, Joker
[1:35:53] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah, what WERE we doing?
[1:35:53] <%Torus1025> Yeah Pat what WERE you doing
[1:35:54] <+ultimafullmetal> Is it a war crime if it was sanctioned by the highest authorities in the galaxy?
[1:35:55] <+Wolfstriker121> OH FUCK OFF jeff
[1:35:57] <%dilly2lame> I should go
[1:35:57] <%NopeBadguy> Get it out of your system, Joker?
[1:35:59] <%RealThiele> not his fault
[1:36:00] <%bread_assassin> That's a very good question, Joker.
[1:36:00] <Badgerconda_> "not if i break your brittle ass legs you little twerp"
[1:36:01] <+tigerfang86> lmao

[1:36:29] <%viewtifulr> im not sorry I HATED THEM heh
[1:36:30] <chamblers> oof
[1:36:30] <Vikingincognito> Seth Green was a great choice

[1:36:32] <RaidenRising> eewww
[1:36:33] <stantheman_97> no but he's totally right the ship was left unprotected for no reason

[1:37:20] <blackjack8182> Ask about Cerberus
[1:37:21] <nyacoo> haha
[1:37:22] <+D00msDayDan> illegal space porn
[1:37:22] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@HefestoForges) (warning)
[1:37:23] <+tigerfang86> joker's ILLEGAL PORNZ
[1:37:23] <%justcallmebobplease> That was NOT a joke
[1:37:24] <dekkitout> What kind of porn these people got
[1:37:24] <Mattais88> He really knows how to push her buttons
[1:37:26] <+senfood> SO STSUNDERE

[1:37:31] <stantheman_97> what an asshole i love her
[1:37:31] <Latija> edi is already hitting on him
[1:37:32] <kirk_vander> Asari-Hanar fetish pron.
[1:37:32] <dukenux> Joker's illegal hentai
[1:37:33] <+SilverDevilfish> Joker saw Kelly's video
[1:37:35] <+AmericanSkidd> She says its a joke anyway
[1:37:37] <%NopeBadguy> Joker into those Hanar-Asari hentai games
[1:37:37] <RaidenRising> cancel joker
[1:37:40] <%bread_assassin> Joker's looking at the forbidden hanar porn.
[1:37:41] <%Bailey__gaming> SPACE PORN gotta be tight tbh
[1:37:42] <dukenux> That's kinda hot, ngl
[1:37:47] <peachy996> I'd much rather Edi be the Ship than some generic sexbot, it was cooler this way
[1:37:48] <KetsuoTaberu> and I'm so sorry
[1:37:48] <$StrawberryPantsu> SWEET SWEET SPACE SHIP PUSSY
[1:37:50] <nyacoo> Jeff's looking up those 120 y/o asari
[1:37:50] <+HefestoForges> oh no I formatted my joke wrong and got timed out LUL
[1:37:51] <dekkitout> The cockpit... well, Joker IS here
[1:37:55] <rekinom> quantum lootbox?
[1:38:00] <TioXyco> EDI is a well writen character, we can't deny tht
[1:38:01] <%RealThiele> touch that helmet
[1:38:03] <%Wurmspawn> @Wurmspawn It's not a matter of animal ancestry, their DNA is literally incompatible with each other. This is why Tuarian and Quarian foods has to be different from Human and Asari foods. They are poison to the opposite member of the species.
[1:38:03] <TioXyco> **That
[1:38:11] <TheAntiNihilist> yo joker you have child porn...JK
[1:38:11] <%HotSauceFiend> is ship pussy "shussy"
[1:38:11] <peachy996> Kind of like Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda
[1:38:12] <%viewtifulr> shissy?
[1:38:28] <+Soliloquy123> Yeah but some of them were locked, remember
[1:38:29] <%JoshManVGH> YEAH!
[1:38:31] <spongeofmystery> It's a real shame the Normandy isn't a Transformer so EDI could fight as a giant robot
[1:38:31] <peachy996> Which wouldn't shock me if Andromeda was the inspiration for Edi
[1:38:31] <dekkitout> @HotSauceFiend Pretty sure it's the cockpit
[1:38:32] <+Soliloquy123> She turned red
[1:38:32] <dukenux> Nussy
[1:38:35] <ingman112> Nah the anti-Reaper is new
[1:38:51] <+senfood> So they're terrorists.
[1:38:51] <zhenthrim213> splinter cells
[1:38:55] <+Cactuskris> like the cia
[1:38:58] <%HotSauceFiend> @dekkitout Damit that's great
[1:38:58] <%RealThiele> like a true abuser
[1:39:05] <%maenos2> this explanation about cerberus is funny given me3
[1:39:07] <Mattais88> He knows everything that happens
[1:39:10] <dukenux> a little
[1:39:11] <%teefpal> @Wurmspawn I remember reading somewhere that dna-based life of different chiralities cant process each others organic matter
[1:39:13] <%AncelDeLambert> thank you, void over Joker's head
[1:39:13] <TioXyco> what was that camera?LUL
[1:39:14] <Sp3ctre48> Did he disappear?
[1:39:14] <peachy996> Okay Invisible Kid
[1:39:15] <+SilverDevilfish> Thanks for the insight air
[1:39:15] <%michingmallecho> Baker’s dozen
[1:39:21] <+DatAsuna> That's gonna change FAST
[1:39:22] <Saffry_Ruzin> Then in 3 Cerberus suddenly has millions of soldiers
[1:39:23] <ape_hawk> "illusive man, how many rogue cells are there?" "depends, which cerberus encounter did you dislike?"
[1:39:23] <heartlesshealer> ceiling camera because joker can't stand
[1:39:26] <peachy996> Never seen what he did
[1:39:27] <Valkryna> they have approximately a billion in mass effect 3
[1:39:27] <dukenux> that seems awfully low
[1:39:38] <blackjack8182> They have the largest army in the universe according to ME3
[1:39:44] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[1:39:45] <Sp3ctre48> Camera please
[1:39:45] <+Scevda> @saffry_ruzin ya, sign….
[1:39:46] <%pokefan9956> geez. inflation doesn't really exist in the mass effect universe does it
[1:39:50] <%RealThiele> elusive man is at the top of the crypto scam
[1:39:52] <tattleworm> this camera has no idea where joker is
[1:39:53] <peachy996> Invisible Kid never seen what he did
[1:40:02] <captain_kirkhammer> @blackjack8182 ehhh that's explained well enough
[1:40:02] <godila2> i see camera showing wrong stuff wasnt fixed
[1:40:04] <%Shubreaker> ooh is that an Operation Paperclip ref
[1:40:04] <OldManDeckardCain> "there are several suspiciously rich furry sponsors behind the illusive man..."
[1:40:07] <%teefpal> Like, imagine a algae with the other chilrality getting into the oceans. It'd coat the oceans beacuse nothing could eat it
[1:40:07] <Sp3ctre48> They're basically the galactic empire in ME3 because shut up
[1:40:08] <+Cactuskris> we´re cooking the mother of all omletts here commander
[1:40:09] <+DatAsuna> Cerberus spends time levling in the hyperbolic time chamber between every game
[1:40:10] <Questiy> Does that mean you essentially wipe out like 40% of Cerberus in ME1?
[1:40:11] <kirk_vander> Cerbecoin.
[1:40:11] <dawarw0lf> Don’t forget about sanctuary. The army didn’t exists before 3
[1:40:14] <dukenux> so they stole the plans, got it
[1:40:16] <Saffry_Ruzin> I suppose you could say Cerberus were indoctrinating people in 3, but still
[1:40:22] <+Scevda> @shubreaker most likely
[1:40:27] <Saffry_Ruzin> Right
[1:40:30] <heartlesshealer> in the Janeway Cluster
[1:40:32] <+tigerfang86> because you are an insane person
[1:40:34] <%Ipsenscastle> Shepard found several million credits lying around in crates during ME1, so billions for Cerberus isn't that impressive
[1:40:35] <%walternatorz> Legion?
[1:40:36] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt My friend is starting this series for the first time. Should I guide them through critical points or let them make their own failures?
[1:40:37] <peachy996> He is an insane person
[1:40:37] <dekkitout> Looks like?
[1:40:39] <TioXyco> he is insane
[1:40:39] <Sp3ctre48> You will kill the crew
[1:40:40] <%teefpal> @Sp3ctre48 you could say that about everything in ME3
[1:40:40] <kirk_vander> Cerberus' numbers make no sense by 3. But hey.
[1:40:41] <%JoshManVGH> Legion!
[1:40:43] <+AmericanSkidd> very dead
[1:40:44] <%kyh9> Cerberus is a terrorist organization in ME1 and is basically a second shadow government in ME2
[1:40:46] <dawarw0lf> That’s why it’s time for dlc
[1:40:48] <%kyh9> DLC
[1:40:48] <MidnightPacif1c> milkshakes
[1:40:49] <mak0t0yukii> They will be Jellyfied
[1:40:52] <munitalprats> crew become VERY dead
[1:40:55] <%Bailey__gaming> lots of war crimes in the Voyager Cluster
[1:40:55] <ingman112> @patstaresat There is actually a new interesting line under the anti-Reaper cyberwarfare
[1:40:56] <%DireHamster> DireHamster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[1:40:59] <%Sadira_snack_attack> but you can watch Kelly get turned to goo
[1:41:00] <%dilly2lame> you've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?
[1:41:00] <%walternatorz> exhaus... OH FUCK
[1:41:01] <munitalprats> crew become goo, if you will
[1:41:02] <dawarw0lf> Time to go pick up a worse mako
[1:41:02] <+RAWPowerStudios> Why would the crew die?
[1:41:03] <+Scevda> You can do one
[1:41:04] <Teras_ode> yummy people juice
[1:41:07] <%bread_assassin> Can't you do like one before people die?
[1:41:08] <mrtanaka111> WHY IS HE SOL BALD
[1:41:12] <SaltyAzteca> y'ever put a cockroach in a blender chat? Its kinda like that
[1:41:14] <+ultimafullmetal> Guys, ME3 explains where Cerberus troops come from. shut up
[1:41:17] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat having a flummoxed realization mid-brag is my favorite bit.
[1:41:19] <%polothegreatest> oh no who are expendable
[1:41:21] <+HefestoForges> wow, shepard
[1:41:23] <+AmericanSkidd> we are built different
[1:41:23] <Sp3ctre48> That was a little rude Shepard LUL
[1:41:27] <%RealThiele> Sol Bald Guy
[1:41:30] <dawarw0lf> @scevda You can’t
[1:41:30] <%teefpal> @RAWPowerStudios it takes time for you to do missions is the justification
[1:41:35] <%Shubreaker> my thread ripper child
[1:41:36] <MidnightPacif1c> so much ram PogChamp
[1:41:44] <Badgerconda_> see, that's where it all goes wrong. you can't let the robots self improve.
[1:41:50] <%Wurmspawn> @Wurmspawn Liek I said, Shepard and Tali may be able to have sex, but reproduction is not biologically possible.
[1:41:52] <peachy996> Can't say I ever put a cockroach in a blender no...you ever spray paint ants?
[1:41:53] <TheAntiNihilist> legion romance?
[1:41:54] <mrtanaka111> @RealThiele thank you
[1:41:58] <Zebroneath> woke up to JUSTICE
[1:42:00] <munitalprats> man i love you geth
[1:42:00] <ExpressNode> I wonder how many 3090s he runs off of.
[1:42:03] <%JoshManVGH> Geth are the Internet
[1:42:06] <%Shubreaker> the Geth WOKE UP TO JUSTICE
[1:42:07] <%teefpal> @bread_assassin in that case "only" half the crew dies
[1:42:11] <%RealThiele> <3
[1:42:12] <Vikingincognito> "Exhaustive reserch" pat its not hard. Just do all the loyalty missions as they come before you recruit Legion, then do his Loyalty, then the Suicide mission
[1:42:13] <Mattais88> Remember how in ME1 they say Cerberus only broke off from the alliance a few months ago? that means all the Jack stuff was under the banner of the Alliance
[1:42:13] <dukenux> gethstalt
[1:42:18] <terrible35> gestalts frucking rock
[1:42:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Gestault is such a cool word.
[1:42:26] <%Dopamien> @Wurmspawn are you reminding yourself? calebKek
[1:42:28] <+condemned_15> I'm more of a replicant kind of guy
[1:42:34] <+StrikeTheErf> shepard-daddy, there is more to me than this platform
[1:42:38] <+fetrigon> FeelsWeirdMan
[1:42:39] <dawarw0lf> Paige important
[1:42:43] <jorniev> SO legion is a cool group of friends
[1:42:52] <%Sartastic> i wanna be part of a hivemind
[1:42:53] <%teefpal> @Mattais88 sure would be cool if they accounted for that in ME2 and 3 and we learn the Alliance was corrupt to the core
[1:42:59] <%ssjklyco> the Geth sound like the Chimera Ants
[1:43:08] <mrtanaka111> whos the best sniper,fish guy,legion or garrus?
[1:43:09] <%Wurmspawn> @Dopamien I started saying that way back when chat was going nuts about getting Tali pregnant.
[1:43:14] <Mattais88> yep
[1:43:31] <%Dopamien> @Wurmspawn you @ yourself
[1:43:38] <%miguelrod777> actual genocide

[1:43:47] <%RealThiele> data center make smarts go way up
[1:43:48] <%teefpal> Cool cyber civilization gets fladerized into pinoccios
[1:43:51] <%Wurmspawn> @Dopamien It's a conversation branch.
[1:44:00] <GohansBeforeHohans> His face plate movements are cool
[1:44:04] <dawarw0lf> This is super important!!!
[1:44:13] <peachy996> you watched them band
[1:44:16] <%trianglehat> 5Head
[1:44:17] <peachy996> and then bang
[1:44:21] <dukenux> Damn
[1:44:26] <%RealThiele> jesus 327 years the quarians keep trying to genocide them
[1:44:31] <%Dopamien> @Wurmspawn my fault I'm dumb I'm on chatterino so it doesn't show up
[1:44:36] <dukenux> Legion is big smart
[1:44:42] <jorniev> SHE IS SAYING HE HAS A HUGE PEEN
[1:44:43] <dawarw0lf> Baby legion
[1:44:48] <%Wurmspawn> @Dopamien No problem.
[1:44:51] <peachy996> Shodan is that you?
[1:44:51] <%robosqueeb> :(
[1:44:52] <Badgerconda_> "no, you don't, you're a walking toaster. GET BACK TO WORK"
[1:44:53] <mrtanaka111> does legion dream of eletric quarians?
[1:44:55] <+tigerfang86> usedFeels
[1:44:59] <%NitronStreams> oh geez
[1:44:59] <%JoshManVGH> Ooooha! The question that started it all!
[1:45:00] <dukenux> MS Sam Legion
[1:45:01] <%viewtifulr> legion big cyber
[1:45:02] <LluthyY> TIME TO KILL THE ROBOTS
[1:45:04] <%robosqueeb> You pass butter
[1:45:06] <%RealThiele> "you spread butter"
[1:45:07] <dukenux> FeelsBadMan
[1:45:07] <%Sartastic> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:45:08] <%dilly2lame> rude
[1:45:12] <%GabeSweetMan> TIME TO MURDER
[1:45:12] <+condemned_15> all robot dogs go to heaven
[1:45:12] <%Dopamien> Do these units smoke dank weed? Who taught you this word?
[1:45:15] <kirk_vander> And so billions died.
[1:45:19] <dekkitout> "Prove to me you are sentient"
[1:45:21] <+senfood> WOW
[1:45:22] <jorniev> THAS SO COOL
[1:45:22] <%machshop> LUL
[1:45:22] <ape_hawk> thats powerful
[1:45:24] <+Bigbossman91> fuck the quarians
[1:45:24] <Valkryna> whoa
[1:45:25] <%JoshManVGH> Aww that's kinda nice
[1:45:26] <+cermo55> and then they did murder
[1:45:27] <+ThomasOfTroy> That's a VERY important distinction that Legion makes
[1:45:27] <MidnightPacif1c> I'm a scientist but,
[1:45:28] <Vikingincognito> THATS SUCH A FANTASTIC DISTINCTION
[1:45:29] <heartlesshealer> SO THEY ASKED BEFORE
[1:45:29] <nyacoo> "yeah whatever man"
[1:45:31] <dawarw0lf> It was asked constantly
[1:45:32] <triangularblasphemy> "This unit thinks the creators can pass their own butter."
[1:45:32] <+tigerfang86> ONLY A BIT
[1:45:34] <Zebroneath> just a lil
[1:45:35] <+AmericanSkidd> that context makes all the difference
[1:45:36] <%RealThiele> Quaren
[1:45:36] <GohansBeforeHohans> @dawarw0lf You just kinda messed with my head a little didnt realize all this time that was him
[1:45:39] <%GabeSweetMan> A touch of an overreaction.
[1:45:39] <+condemned_15> that;s interesting
[1:45:40] <Badgerconda_> Pat, you can't just let your appliances start thinking they're people.
[1:45:41] <%machshop> so there was a long line of cool quarians and one fucked it up
[1:45:41] <+redthebaron> legion is so cool
[1:45:43] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> A quarian WOMAN leave it to the WOMAN am I right?
[1:45:45] <%walternatorz> forget the mission, just keep talking to Legion
[1:45:46] <Dunmarkh> And then the quarians got nae naed
[1:45:46] <murdocismyhero> Jokes on you, You are a video game, no one has souls
[1:45:52] <ExpressNode> "That's interesting" BYE
[1:45:52] <Sp3ctre48> Genocide was indeed a slight overreaction to that question
[1:45:58] <%JoshManVGH> So there were people who reacted with kindness and compassion, mabey
[1:46:02] <peachy996> and then the 5th time was "shut up, toaster"
[1:46:02] <%teefpal> @dekkitout "my mom sucked me good and hard through my jorts"
[1:46:02] <dukenux> "You're doing just fine without one."
[1:46:04] <+cermo55> Quarians after hearing that: #$%^#$%^#$
[1:46:05] <%robosqueeb> @TurtlesAndTentacles geth incels RISE UP
[1:46:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> Pat, you are going to LOVE ME3's geth lore
[1:46:09] <revmaddox> people forget just how good Mass Effects writing was
[1:46:10] <zhenthrim213> uh oh murder
[1:46:10] <%Solid_Stro> Man, the Geth and Quarians are the most well written species in fiction
[1:46:11] <lloyddboy> HELP MY TOASTER ASKED WHAT BEING HORNY IS LIKE
[1:46:12] <dawarw0lf> @gohansbeforehohans I took notice because of a mission in 3
[1:46:12] <BigFingerRo> "YEAH THAT'S COOL AND ALL, BUT NOW TIME TO BONING MY ALEIN GIRL"
[1:46:14] <rekinom> "Toaster's sentient"
[1:46:15] <+Soliloquy123> It took one Quarian Karen to get all pissy about it and start a war
[1:46:18] <Mattais88> We just accidently'd a sentience
[1:46:19] <+HefestoForges> pee stored in the dick confirmed
[1:46:20] <heartlesshealer> empty orb
[1:46:21] <AthenaAegis> PISS GOBLINS Kappa
[1:46:22] <AluxStreams> Would be pretty creepy if all your toasters asked you if they had a soul over the course of a month.
[1:46:22] <jorniev> TURN UP THE MUSIC
[1:46:23] <leinadtonu> do a suicide pee
[1:46:24] <%dilly2lame> pee is stored in the balls tho

[1:46:26] <%RealThiele> empty the tits of piss
[1:46:27] <Vikingincognito> @JoshManVGH ME3 shows there were sympathetic Quarians
[1:46:32] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @robosqueeb LMAO YOU MADE ME SPIT MY DRINK LMAOOOOO
[1:46:36] <jorniev> SUICIDE MISSION THEME IS THE BEST
[1:46:40] <dawarw0lf> The Geth consensus mission is just legion’s past
[1:46:42] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls
[1:46:45] <%HairballCT> so basically the geth asking if they have a soul is the equivalent to "are we there yet?"
[1:46:45] <mrtanaka111> lets not pretend we woulndt put all ai on fulls top if this happened on earth
[1:46:50] <Sp3ctre48> There are like 2 sympathetic Quarians in our time
[1:46:52] <+condemned_15> Toonami just dropped a trailer for a Blade Runner series

[1:47:00] <AthenaAegis> @RealThiele God dammit, I nearly spit out my drink lmao
[1:47:03] <triangularblasphemy> @AluxStreams Your toaster, your fridge, your thermostat. Everything in your smart house all screaming at you about souls and ontology and dreams.
[1:47:03] <%teefpal> Suicide Mission is one of the best part of the series
[1:47:06] <BigFingerRo> piss is in the balls, not in the dick
[1:47:09] <PunchSlugfest> @condemned_15 no shit?
[1:47:12] <+AmericanSkidd> go poop before suicide missions is good advice for everybody
[1:47:21] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:47:29] <dukenux> @condemned_15 The same people as that 2022 short?
[1:47:31] <dekkitout> @mrtanaka111 No, because on Earth we have enough media to make a sufficient conclusion
[1:47:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @mrtanaka111 I for one welcome our AI overlords, they cant do much worse than the human overlords
[1:47:38] <+condemned_15> @PunchSlugfest it's 3d animated
[1:47:39] <%robosqueeb> piss can literally be stored in the knees
[1:47:40] <%teefpal> @triangularblasphemy "none of us have souls, conciousness is peacock feathers designed to torment us, stfu"
[1:47:59] <+Scevda> I can't believe that I have got to personally witness both Mass Effect and Game of Thrones both piss away their entire zeitgeist momentum at the final moment for each series.
[1:48:00] <KetsuoTaberu> YAY

[1:52:00] <%Dopamien> illusive man needs some chapstick
[1:52:01] <%GabeSweetMan> "Assuming control" is quite a power move statement to say during sex.
[1:52:06] <dukenux> "Shepard's fucking the Quarian, just as planned" *Gendo pose*
[1:52:10] <mrtanaka111> so cerberus reconstructed shepard but couldn give him a few extra hairs
[1:52:17] <+PenmanLupine> thanks Martin Sheen
[1:52:17] <GohansBeforeHohans> @saiyanblitz Lmao
[1:52:18] <peachy996> Look at that screenshot angle
[1:52:20] <BigFingerRo> Shepard crushed that qussy and I didn't tell him no!
[1:52:26] <jorniev> here we go
[1:52:26] <+Scevda> Man, the tali face meme was great.....good times.
[1:52:27] <Sp3ctre48> Garrus' romance is really vanilla because they still can't decide what Turians should look like outside of their armor
[1:52:30] <%Vyskus> @mrtanaka111 they wanted him EXACTLY as he was
[1:52:33] <peachy996> Alright this is the scariest location in Mass Effect I think
[1:52:33] <Ravioli_Ronin> EVIL REPAY
[1:52:35] <%Monkeyweed21> oh no the halloween relay
[1:52:39] <blackjack8182> LET'S DO THIS!
[1:52:41] <%machshop> what's christmas
[1:52:42] <%demiiluna> Imagine you start the suicide mission and it's just everyone cheering as the Normandy plows full-speed into an asteroid followed by a cut to credits.
[1:52:42] <%HotSauceFiend> @mrtanaka111 they gave him scars after the surgery
[1:52:43] <%maenos2> YAY BEST MUSIC
[1:52:43] <peachy996> Imagine putting your ship here
[1:52:44] <%JoshManVGH> Illusive Mans 30 year eugenics project
[1:52:44] <BigFingerRo> Qrush the Qussy!}
[1:52:44] <terrible35> No Bosley hair treatment in the future, the tech lost to time
[1:52:48] <+AmericanSkidd> JACOB GET OFF THE COMM
[1:52:50] <stantheman_97> now let everyone die
[1:52:50] <jorniev> aw man
[1:52:53] <peachy996> It's almost nightmarish
[1:52:54] <mrtanaka111> is baldness a tatical advantege?
[1:52:57] <jorniev> sound bad on my end
[1:52:59] <%machshop> skrrrrrrt
[1:52:59] <+Scevda> Cool as fuck scene
[1:53:03] <%RealThiele> just zap jacob to release the excess
[1:53:07] <SaltyAzteca> DID STAR WARS TAKE THIS SCENE
[1:53:08] <ape_hawk> RIGHT INTO A SHIP GRAVEYARD
[1:53:11] <SaltyAzteca> STAR TREK*
[1:53:11] <peachy996> Just right next to the Galactic Core
[1:53:11] <Sp3ctre48> The music for the suicide mission is so good
[1:53:14] <%Solid_Stro> Love this game so much
[1:53:16] <dawarw0lf> I think desponoa gives me more fears
[1:53:21] <Laecerelius> "Awww jeeze, guys, when you rebuilt me couldn't you have fixed my hair too?!"
[1:53:22] <%G_Thunders> Wouldn’t the red imply the relay is like, broken?
[1:53:26] <dawarw0lf> Fear of oceans
[1:53:28] <%RealThiele> I mean JJ abrams is a hack, so yes?
[1:53:30] <+tinytinykittycat> straight from trek 09
[1:53:41] <Sp3ctre48> No it's red cause evil
[1:53:42] <SaltyAzteca> @RealThiele FIEND
[1:53:42] <+Scevda> heh accretion disk
[1:53:44] <jorniev> IS THIS THAT STAR WARS? I DINT WATCH IT?
[1:53:55] <Ravioli_Ronin> Nah it’s red cause it’s cherry flavored
[1:53:57] <tattleworm> ORB
[1:53:59] <BigFingerRo> I CLAPPED?
[1:54:02] <%demiiluna> Are you going to take this opportunity to murder Jacob and make it look like an accident?
[1:54:03] <%Dopamien> good thing time doesn't just skip 400 years later, you know being so close to a black hole
[1:54:09] <GohansBeforeHohans> @G_Thunders Its using a different type of mass effect energy straight from the reapers
[1:54:13] <+SiameseDuck> Now the game won't stutter and struggle not to die as it keeps track of all your commander suicide points like it did on the 360
[1:54:16] <Josef_Stryker> Cain time?
[1:54:18] <jorniev> its red because of COMUNISM
[1:54:18] <Josef_Stryker> Cain time
[1:54:20] <BigFingerRo> @Ravioli_Ronin Strawberry you cad!
[1:54:20] <+senfood> I love how she keeps callling him Jeff.
[1:54:23] <%NopeBadguy> JACK DEAD
[1:54:23] <+Chaos_Aether> hope your upgrades hold
[1:54:25] <%RealThiele> HES SUCH A SHIT FILMMAKER THO JJ ABRAMS KILLED STARWARS, LOST, FRINGE, HE CANT FINISH A PLOT
[1:54:25] <+AmericanSkidd> Oculus Rift is attacking
[1:54:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> doc_ock_rokc subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! so 31 months woo. I'm not employed by that one company sadly but its due to some circumstances i may get a new defense job soon. Stepdad's cancer is bad they had to take him off the super good experimental treatment but hopefully that'll be fixed soon.
[1:54:30] <%NopeBadguy> if only
[1:54:32] <%walternatorz> I noticed Pat left one upgrade for the ship unpurchased
[1:54:44] <Sp3ctre48> For the uninformed people would start dying here if you didn't get the ship upgrades
[1:54:46] <sirrice77> its hilarious how if you don't have the new plating a lazer just rips through and kills jack
[1:54:46] <peachy996> That's 1 death avoided
[1:54:46] <%BioHunter> o forget who dies here
[1:54:47] <%GabeSweetMan> These are the upgrade checks that kill people off if you didn't get them.
[1:54:48] <%BioHunter> i*
[1:54:52] <Dunmarkh> @walternatorz med bay
[1:54:58] <%HotSauceFiend> So you can fail this mission completely if you don't buy any upgrades i guess right? It's not like Minecraft where a failthrough is possible
[1:55:03] <dukenux> modern SW/Trek 100% stole shit from ME. which is just circle coming around
[1:55:04] <+Cactuskris> only upgrads that mtter are garrus, jacob and one other
[1:55:04] <AluxStreams> The way Joker flies this war frigate as if it's the Milennium Falcon is crazy.
[1:55:04] <dawarw0lf> This is the first time I’ve heard fringe war ruined
[1:55:10] <+Scevda> Grunt could deal with it himself
[1:55:12] <TheAntiNihilist> imagine if a ship captain said to take a ship in crappy and rough
[1:55:13] <%BeeComfy> Damn Go get them
[1:55:13] <+SilverDevilfish> Nerd crews
[1:55:14] <%Vyskus> I love you Legion I love you Tali
[1:55:16] <blackjack8182> Bring Miranda! It’s hilarious.
[1:55:18] <%Torus1025> Take the Boi
[1:55:18] <BigFingerRo> SET PHASERS TO PUSSCRUSH
[1:55:20] <%NopeBadguy> I don't like the white for Legion. It makes him look like a medic.
[1:55:21] <%GabeSweetMan> The robo crew
[1:55:21] <Laecerelius> robo fuck squad
[1:55:24] <%G_Thunders> @realthiele JJ only helped write the first 3 episodes of Lost lol. Same deal with Fringe
[1:55:26] <SaltyAzteca> Grunt could not be happier
[1:55:26] <%walternatorz> @walternatorz aw, I hoped he was targeting Jacob
[1:55:32] <%sniffy77> shepard how are you breathing
[1:55:35] <Vikingincognito> @HotSauceFiend the entier crew can die if you keep fucking up
[1:55:36] <sirrice77> @HotSauceFiend sort of, you i believe you technically succeed at the cost of every life
[1:55:39] <Sp3ctre48> @HotSauceFiend Basically, everyone can die if you don't do it right
[1:55:41] <%JoshManVGH> Would love to go down ther and find Grunt and Jack just having the best time
[1:55:41] <SaltyAzteca> DID IT JUST LUL
[1:55:42] <%Shubreaker> KILL THE FACEBOOK DRONE
[1:55:42] <peachy996> Kill that Oculus Rift
[1:55:42] <+SilverDevilfish> oh no a VR headset
[1:55:43] <ape_hawk> so, would this be an Oculus Rift?
[1:55:46] <%sniffy77> you're exposed to the vacuum of space
[1:55:48] <mrtanaka111> oculus
[1:55:52] <dukenux> those are scary
[1:55:53] <jillpilled> KILL THE OCULUS
[1:55:56] <+senfood> b i g e y e
[1:55:58] <%RealThiele> @G_Thunders true it was his lickspittles Orci and Kurtzman that did the rest
[1:55:59] <Sp3ctre48> Most it means is that you can't bring your Shepard into Mass Effect 3
[1:56:00] <Ravioli_Ronin> Is this Destiny?
[1:56:01] <AthenaAegis> OCULUS?!? WutFace
[1:56:03] <Mattais88> @HotSauceFiend Nah, but each missed upgrade will kill a team member, and if unloyal enough can die during the mission you fail to escape
[1:56:03] <%sunsetdisc0> sunsetdisc0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! boy I sure hope nothing in this ship malfunctions and kills me as we cross the omega 4 relay
[1:56:05] <%trianglehat> special eyes
[1:56:07] <terrible35> this is what facebook makes out of the occulus ip
[1:56:08] <dawarw0lf> @g_thunders Like the last season wasn’t the best but it was fare from horrible. Never watched lost
[1:56:10] <mrtanaka111> My camera obscura
[1:56:11] <+PenmanLupine> Facebook is working with the Collectors!!!
[1:56:13] <+Cactuskris> occulus in the omega 4 rift
[1:56:14] <%CatastropheCorvid> @ape_hawk We discontinued the Rift line. That's a Quest.
[1:56:19] <%JoshManVGH> Oh cool that's where destiny got the idea
[1:56:26] <GohansBeforeHohans> @HotSauceFiend Even Shepard can die if you fuck up bad enough
[1:56:29] <%StaceMcGate> and everyone lived
[1:56:36] <stantheman_97> music Kreygasm
[1:56:38] <mrtanaka111> so epic wow
[1:56:40] <dukenux> Maybe find some straps, shep
[1:56:40] <dekkitout> Don't scratch the paint, Jeff
[1:56:43] <+ALazo> good thing we upgraded
[1:56:47] <%NopeBadguy> Yes
[1:56:47] <%machshop> sure why not
[1:56:48] <Ravioli_Ronin> Like who played this game and was like “nah I don’t wanna upgrade my ship to the max”?
[1:56:49] <+Scevda> Yeah it never makes sense
[1:56:50] <MidnightPacif1c> a leaf on the wind Kappa
[1:56:51] <%StaceMcGate> because you brought Tali
[1:56:52] <lloyddboy> you took tali
[1:56:52] <%miguelrod777> tali's with you
[1:56:53] <%NopeBadguy> Kasumi is first on the priority list for the engine room
[1:56:55] <%NopeBadguy> If you haveh er
[1:56:56] <%Vyskus> Probably cause tali is in your squad
[1:56:56] <dukenux> She was stealing fuel
[1:56:56] <+senfood> She looks unusually hype.
[1:56:57] <%HotSauceFiend> @GohansBeforeHohans i figured ME3 would just rebuild Shepard again or something
[1:56:57] <%Monkeyweed21> you took Tali
[1:56:58] <%Shubreaker> cause you grabbed Legion and Tali
[1:57:00] <dekkitout> Well duh, Tali's all sex'd out
[1:57:01] <peachy996> Kasumi is a tech and you took both techs with you
[1:57:01] <dawarw0lf> JACK WALL YOUR THE BEST
[1:57:03] <+Scevda> but its always there with her DLC and fully prepared
[1:57:04] <%teefpal> @Ravioli_Ronin speedrunners?
[1:57:06] <Josef_Stryker> CAIN TIME
[1:57:06] <%G_Thunders> @dawarw0lf Oh I agree, Fringe and Lost both had fine last seasons. At the very least they didn’t ruin any of the characters
[1:57:08] <%viewtifulr> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:57:10] <+FennecZephyr> @Ravioli_Ronin To be fair, that doesn't do anything until now
[1:57:10] <Josef_Stryker> USE THE CAIN
[1:57:13] <+AmericanSkidd> first to die
[1:57:15] <%tank7013> Even if you don't have tali
[1:57:18] <%Solid_Stro> If you have Tali in your party, yes
[1:57:19] <SaltyAzteca> I AM THE HEAVY WEAPON
[1:57:22] <mrtanaka111> oculus, armor
[1:57:27] <%tank7013> like down there with you
[1:57:28] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Kasumi can also be used for your Tech Expert
[1:57:29] <gerryxeszo1> The "points" system is kinda fucked. Mordin having so little points compared to others never made sense
[1:57:29] <%robosqueeb> "Dismantle mines, Yes? Or you die..."
[1:57:30] <+HefestoForges> it just means eye
[1:57:30] <%twistedj3ster> kill it, it sucks!
[1:57:31] <$StrawberryPantsu> HEY IT'S THAT BOSS FROM METROID PRIME HUNTERS
[1:57:34] <DracaenaLeaf> Murder the Oculus Rift!
[1:57:34] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you could just call it a Beholder
[1:57:35] <GohansBeforeHohans> @HotSauceFiend Tbh Ive never seen the fallout if Shepard dies in 2 lol
[1:57:36] <%JoshManVGH> It's a Servitor
[1:57:36] <Sp3ctre48> You'd think it would be more concerning that these things are beaming holes into the ship
[1:57:40] <%maenos2> i mean, it means eye basically doesn't it
[1:57:42] <%teefpal> It's like having the main badguy be called Discord
[1:57:46] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt It doesn't. We discontinued it. Quest now.
[1:57:46] <Ravioli_Ronin> What’s the one in Destiny called?
[1:57:49] <dawarw0lf> @g_thunders I heard lost ended weird
[1:57:52] <mrtanaka111> god, shut up miranda
[1:57:54] <SaltyAzteca> Its a singularity
[1:58:05] <GohansBeforeHohans> @teefpal Or Chaos scjLaugh
[1:58:06] <dukenux> wow i cant believe Metroid Dread ripped this off
[1:58:09] <Mattais88> VENGENCE
[1:58:09] <+trackles_64> Hero moment
[1:58:11] <$Wafflum> Pure concentrated evil
[1:58:11] <sgtbloopface> @GohansBeforeHohans i believe canonically ME3 cannot happen if sheperd dies
[1:58:14] <Ravioli_Ronin> The collector Bass
[1:58:16] <spongeofmystery> *happy Garrus noises*
[1:58:17] <%Shubreaker> @ravioli_ronin servitors
[1:58:18] <%NopeBadguy> Garrus should have a line here
[1:58:20] <SaltyAzteca> REVENGEANCING
[1:58:25] <%HotSauceFiend> @PatStaresAt what's the fallout if Shepard dies in this mission? How does that play out in ME3?
[1:58:27] <jorniev> WASP SHIP
[1:58:28] <kirk_vander> Time for calibrations to pay off.
[1:58:29] <+senfood> V I O L E N C E
[1:58:29] <%RealThiele> CALIBRATIONS COMPLETE
[1:58:31] <%JoshManVGH> Damn that is a huge ship!
[1:58:32] <%dilly2lame> thanix for the memories, collectors 😎
[1:58:32] <peachy996> Good thing that ship doesn't have humans on it anymore right?
[1:58:38] <%teefpal> @GohansBeforeHohans you cant transfer your save if shep dies
[1:58:40] <+AmericanSkidd> FUCK EM UP
[1:58:44] <+BigBruthaThunda> WAR DRUMS
[1:58:45] <BrinstarGardeningSociety> MOONSTONE CANNON, FIRE
[1:58:45] <+Cactuskris> perfectly calibreated
[1:58:45] <digaogrunge> GARRUS CALIBRATED THOSE CANNONS
[1:58:47] <%StaceMcGate> KAMEHAMEHA
[1:58:51] <Josef_Stryker> All those Calibrations for that moment
[1:58:56] <dukenux> how often do you get to fire tgat thing
[1:58:57] <SaltyAzteca> CALIBRATE THIS DICK
[1:58:57] <+cermo55> yeah calibrations!!!
[1:58:57] <%viewtifulr> And then kirby comes by on the legendary air machine!
[1:59:02] <knight_verse> @sgtbloopface ME3 Citadel dlc would like a word with you. (not saying what it is for obvious reasons)
[1:59:04] <+trackles_64> calibrated guns
[1:59:05] <dawarw0lf> Are you ready for the jokes in 3
[1:59:07] <+HefestoForges> kablamo
[1:59:09] <Josef_Stryker> PERFECTLY CALIBRATED
[1:59:09] <BigFingerRo> OCTOQUSSY TENTACLES?
[1:59:13] <GohansBeforeHohans> @sgtbloopface So you defeat the collectors and save the galaxy just for it to get fucked a few months later scjLaugh
[1:59:15] <Ravioli_Ronin> Pew pew
[1:59:16] <%walternatorz> and all the humans captured from the normandy were evaporated
[1:59:17] <%JoshManVGH> They coulda showed Garrus shooting the gun
[1:59:17] <kirk_vander> In that moment. he ascended to his godhood in Mass Effect 3.
[1:59:18] <%G_Thunders> @dawarw0lf It makes sense in context, but a lot people watched it expecting all the answers in the final episode so it kinda became a meme that the end makes no sense.
[1:59:22] <+senfood> CALLIBRATE DEEZ NUTS
[1:59:22] <Mattais88> @HotSauceFiend You can't import it through, so have to make a new one from scratch
[1:59:23] <mr_saturday93> Title drop!
[1:59:24] <%HotSauceFiend> I remember when i played the original version there was a distinct loading screen at each of these decision points
[1:59:32] <%Torus1025> That works, sure
[1:59:36] <GohansBeforeHohans> @teefpal Oh shit had no idea but it makes sense
[1:59:37] <Wickface> He said the word!
[1:59:41] <%JoshManVGH> I just wanna see the team have a great time
[1:59:49] <%sunsetdisc0> THAT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT WING OFF
[1:59:53] <%RealThiele> ships in one piece it counts
[1:59:56] <mrtanaka111> mirands wrong
[1:59:57] <+AmericanSkidd> SHUT UP MIRANDA
[1:59:58] <%JohnAtDawn> He probably did though, call the doctor
[1:59:59] <%Sol_Install> I thought that was in game lol
[2:00:03] <+trackles_64> miranda so emo
[2:00:03] <+Scevda> IVE HAD QUSSY, I CAN DO ANYTHING

[2:00:08] <sightlesspoem> kill Miranda so hard
[2:00:10] <%walternatorz> those foley artists are really good. that metal falling sounded totally real
[2:00:15] <dawarw0lf> @g_thunders I remember my mom hating it as much as my brother hates got’s ending
[2:00:18] <jorniev> THIS is why Me3 war felt so disappointing, because they already had done this before
[2:00:22] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Kasumi can be used for your Tech Expert if you wanna hear some new lines.
[2:00:26] <GohansBeforeHohans> Please stop sayin Qussy chat lmao

[2:02:26] <digaogrunge> your boy Legion
[2:02:28] <+SiameseDuck> Sent Tali onto the shaft. I mean into
[2:02:31] <Sp3ctre48> So Tali Legion and Kasumi are the right choices there
[2:02:31] <%NopeBadguy> Tali and Legion don't really do anything useful here
[2:02:32] <somekindofsam> talk or legion
[2:02:34] <%RealThiele> jacob will live like his father
[2:02:34] <teridax4> Kill jacob
[2:02:35] <Josef_Stryker> Fiiiiine, I guess Jacob can live
[2:02:35] <%andrewofbob> Jacob volunteers to needlessly die
[2:02:37] <mesamus> ok thought you were gonna send jacob
[2:02:37] <+Urgotfantasy> Tali's got that full womb courage
[2:02:40] <+Scevda> Jack lol
[2:02:41] <%faintsmile> love how jacob sucks for ALL of these lmfao
[2:02:42] <dukenux> Right, Tali's already experienced in working the shaft
[2:02:46] <%miguelrod777> garrus agrees lmao
[2:02:48] <peachy996> Garrus shakes his head no lol
[2:02:48] <mesamus> send miranda as team leader

[2:02:53] <%StaceMcGate> Garrus
[2:02:53] <+SilverDevilfish> So not you Miranda
[2:02:54] <%NopeBadguy> So if Jack's dead, Garrus raises the objection at Miranda here
[2:02:54] <%miguelrod777> GARRUS
[2:02:54] <GohansBeforeHohans> Yeah like Garrus
[2:02:55] <peachy996> Love that character touch
[2:02:56] <+trackles_64> you think you got loyalty bitch?
[2:02:56] <tattleworm> do not pick zaeed
[2:02:56] <blackjack8182> Garrus
[2:02:56] <dawarw0lf> @jorniev @sp3ctre48 if we’re talking about earth as a mission I’d agree but 3 is fucking excellent at making the war impactful during the entire game
[2:02:59] <Josef_Stryker> GARRUS
[2:03:00] <+Wolfstriker121> GARRUS
[2:03:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Garrus

[2:03:57] <+trackles_64> geefy
[2:03:58] <gerryxeszo1> Tali is a bad Leader choice and Miranda says so, but Garrus also literally got his entire team wiped but she's okay with him as a choice
[2:04:04] <SkinnyRite> Pooch continues to continue crimes
[2:04:05] <%machshop> Legion and Samara
[2:04:08] <Ravioli_Ronin> Ominous dog noises
[2:04:08] <+condemned_15> gief is hyped
[2:04:10] <+senfood> WHO'S BARKING
[2:04:11] <%RealThiele> gief stream!

[2:04:13] <%Foopoof> gief came to DESTROY
[2:04:14] <%justcallmebobplease> Noooo!
[2:04:14] <+Scevda> @gerryxeszo1 Ya
[2:04:16] <%G_Thunders> He’s hype
[2:04:23] <+AmericanSkidd> The pet varren is getting rowdy
[2:04:23] <+Scevda> @gerryxeszo1 And then becomes admiral
[2:04:25] <%teefpal> gief is best videogame
[2:04:28] <digaogrunge> RUB HIS BELLY
[2:04:29] <%JoshManVGH> Dog excited for extreme danger!
[2:04:29] <leinadtonu> Gief about to be sent on a suicide mission
[2:04:32] <blackjack8182> He’s hyped for the suicide mission
[2:04:36] <%RealThiele> pats excited and it makes the boy excited
[2:04:39] <peachy996> Maybe if ME3 let you have your ME2 squad or at least interact with them in person instead of a phone call, it could be just as good as this moment in ME2
[2:04:42] <Sp3ctre48> Well I mean, it wasn't Garrus's fault that his entire team died
[2:04:44] <BigFingerRo> the dog grows uneasy
[2:04:49] <dawarw0lf> @jorniev All the talks on the citadel prove you wrong. Like your objectively wrong. The asari huntress. The old lady missing her son. It’s all so impactful
[2:04:54] <BigFingerRo> He becomes the rambunctious
[2:05:07] <+Cactuskris> team leaders is always jacob miranda or garrus tech expert is kasumi legion or tali and biotics is jack or samara
[2:05:31] <+Cactuskris> leave zaeed and garrus always with the 2 team
[2:05:32] <peachy996> Who would ever pick Jacob
[2:05:41] <+Scevda> I send legion as a synthetic hes less likely to get harmed by whatever is int the shaft.
[2:05:44] <%demiiluna> I picked Zaeed for the Fire Team leader and he fucking bit it hard. 50 years of mercenary experience don't make a good leader compared to fucking JACOB?!
[2:05:52] <Sp3ctre48> also always send Mordin back with the crew
[2:05:59] <+Scevda> I send Zaeed to bull rush em
[2:06:01] <+Cactuskris> zaeed is a bad leader
[2:06:04] <PunchSlugfest> always mordin
[2:06:07] <dawarw0lf> The war is felt all across 3 as the devastating thing it was always going to be so much so that there has to be a device specifically made to end it
[2:06:08] <+Cactuskris> he always gets his team killed
[2:06:10] <%robosqueeb> @demiiluna same! It was such bs
[2:06:10] <Vikingincognito> @demiiluna I;m with you, Zaeed should work there
[2:06:12] <+Scevda> I keep the full quarian womb with me
[2:06:18] <Sp3ctre48> or he'll just die randomly even if you do everything right
[2:06:19] <peachy996> I got Grunt killed because I thought he was good enough to lead a team on account of his loyalty mission
[2:06:23] <mrtanaka111> will pat star me3 today?
[2:06:24] <peachy996> Big whoops on y part
[2:06:36] <%NopeBadguy> Yeah, Grunt's not a leader
[2:06:39] <%NopeBadguy> He's a Grunt
[2:06:41] <Vikingincognito> @mrtanaka111 Nah, hes still got DLC
[2:06:43] <+Scevda> @mrtanaka111 I hope so
[2:06:45] <peachy996> And in 3 he leads a team of his own anyway so I wasn't far off
[2:06:46] <Josef_Stryker> Grunt is only tough but he doesn't understand leadership. He's an attack dog basically
[2:06:48] <Sp3ctre48> @mrtanaka111 We still have the terrible arrival dlc for ME2 so nah
[2:06:51] <nyacoo> he a baby
[2:06:53] <dawarw0lf> The only good thing about earth as a mission is the dog fight in space and the last survive section
[2:06:53] <PunchSlugfest> @Sp3ctre48 Yeah, his squad was betrayed from within
[2:06:54] <+SiameseDuck> @demiiluna Maybe the reasoning is because he's a merc and not a trained squad leader? Even though he'd realistically have leadership experience with all the shit he did. I dunno it's stupid, it's just my guess
[2:06:55] <+Scevda> @NopeBadguy ya its in the name lol
[2:06:56] <SkinnyRite> they're all bad leaders. All of them had a team at one point who all died, except for Mordin i guess. honestly with Jack turning out to be a TEACHER in 3 she might just be the best choice
[2:06:56] <mrtanaka111> ahhhh
[2:06:57] <kirk_vander> Until Wrex promoted him.
[2:07:05] <TrollKing96> my granddad just beat ME2. He only lost Thane because he fudged his Loyalty Mission.
[2:07:07] <%BlackStarAura> I always send Tali back and fight with Mordin in the Reaper room
[2:07:19] <Josef_Stryker> Garrus knows leadership well considering his success with his Omega team. They only died due to circumstances out of his control
[2:07:27] <+SiameseDuck> Didn't even know you could fudge Thane's loyalty mission
[2:07:30] <%NopeBadguy> Zaeed isn't a good fire team leader bc if you saw his loyalty mission, you wouldn't pick him as a leader either
[2:07:32] <PunchSlugfest> @TrollKing96 Hopefully he saved Cpt. Karrahe
[2:07:34] <%NopeBadguy> Zaeed is too unstable
[2:07:45] <peachy996> Miranda is a good bait and switch for the Leader/Biotic role. Feels like that was Bioware trying to trick you
[2:07:46] <+Scevda> @TrollKing96 Thats the easiest to mess up so I don't blame him/
[2:07:47] <mrtanaka111> zaeeed is the only survivor
[2:07:48] <+Cactuskris> zaeed loyalty mission showed that he had no regards for peoples lives he is a survivor not a leader
[2:07:49] <mrtanaka111> not a leader
[2:07:50] <Sp3ctre48> it literally wasn't his fault that his team died, Garrus was doing fine as a leader before then
[2:07:50] <+SiameseDuck> Yeah fair enough, I could buy that
[2:07:52] <dawarw0lf> Why is Jacob good at leading? I don’t understand.
[2:07:54] <Josef_Stryker> Compared that to say Tali who kept getting all her teams killed or Zaeed where he keeps talking about being the last guy left in the squads he goes on missions with.
[2:07:55] <gerryxeszo1> My fiance played Suicide Mission first time this month and it's fine except last part's too vague that you need to leave the "heavy" squadmates at the last choice
[2:08:06] <Josef_Stryker> I don't get how Jacob is suitable tho. Is it because he was a Corsair?
[2:08:17] <+Cactuskris> garus is described as having leadership skills if he steps out of shepards shadow in shadowbroker dlc
[2:08:28] <+SiameseDuck> Jacob went through Alliance leadership training if I remember correctly
[2:08:29] <Sp3ctre48> Jacob led people at some point I guess, who cares you won't pick him anyway
[2:08:31] <kirk_vander> Jack has some of the best character development out of the ME2 cast. Barring Mordin.
[2:08:34] <mrtanaka111> garrus was aways a mvp
[2:08:35] <%dilly2lame> Zaeed is lone wolf
[2:08:45] <+Scevda> @Josef_Stryker because daddy issues, which is funny because its for that same reason the others arent good picks
[2:08:49] <%sunsetdisc0> @dawarw0lf because military experience directly correlates to leadership capability, somehow
[2:08:52] <Vikingincognito> @Cactuskris true, good catch
[2:08:52] <Josef_Stryker> I guess being head of the security team in Cerberus has to count for something too
[2:08:57] <peachy996> Jack is the best choice for the bubble but picking Samara isn't bad either
[2:09:06] <peachy996> It just adds to Jack's arc more than Samara's
[2:09:06] <+Scevda> @kirk_vander true, I was surprised by it as well
[2:09:09] <dawarw0lf> ME 3 Jack could lead a team
[2:09:13] <Josef_Stryker> Literally everyone in the Normandy has daddy issues or is the daddy issues
[2:09:17] <+SiameseDuck> Gotta pick the blue space mom
[2:09:19] <Vikingincognito> @peachy996 JAck makes the most sense thematically
[2:09:26] <%BlackStarAura> I often pick Jacob and Miranda for the fire teams.
[2:09:26] <%demiiluna> I picked Samara for bubble because I figured Jack was more unstable and Samara was more focused and paladin-like
[2:09:29] <gerryxeszo1> Also it never made sense to me why Mordin has such a low survivability/durability point variable when you chart out the Suicide Mission
[2:09:40] <%teefpal> @Josef_Stryker It's a useful trope for easy character development/arcs
[2:09:43] <%ShawnTK_> @Josef_Stryker Not Mordin
[2:09:44] <Sp3ctre48> Samara was the mommy issue in her loyalty mission BabyRage
[2:09:47] <Vikingincognito> Its because hes salaraian
[2:09:49] <peachy996> Probably because he's an old Salarian and in STG
[2:09:59] <%teefpal> @gerryxeszo1 he *is* the most elderly
[2:10:03] <+Cactuskris> @gerryxeszo1 he only does black ops mission and no out rights assaults
[2:10:06] <%dilly2lame> @gerryxeszo1 because you should feel bad for picking her over Samara
[2:10:10] <dawarw0lf> @gerryxeszo1 Because he’s a salarian. He’s a badass but still squishy. Same with tail.
[2:10:10] <+Scevda> @gerryxeszo1 Hes medic also like 110 in human yers.
[2:10:12] <%robosqueeb> samara is almost as much of a nothing character as Jacob imo. Justicars are a dope concept tho
[2:10:23] <Sp3ctre48> tbf, by that logic Tali should probably also have low survivability
[2:10:27] <+tinytinykittycat> I usually sent Mordin back with surviving crew
[2:10:36] <mrtanaka111> @robosqueeb hard disagree
[2:10:45] <+Scevda> @Sp3ctre48 isn't she just one level up from mordin?
[2:10:51] <gerryxeszo1> But Mordin has hella combat/field experience and general knowledge over even say, Tali or maybe Kasumi, and he's even points with them?
[2:10:53] <Sp3ctre48> Samara is fine
[2:10:54] <captain_kirkhammer> @gerryxeszo1 he's old and he was trained for spec ops
[2:10:54] <PunchSlugfest> @robosqueeb but samara hot tho
[2:10:56] <peachy996> I also find it funny how the bubble doesn't kill the person using it, it kills one of your squad. So even if you hate Miranda and picked her hoping to see her die.
[2:10:58] <+Cactuskris> the only thing people get wrong is miranda as biotic cause she says any biotic will do and is describes as having enhanched biotics
[2:11:03] <peachy996> She won't die there lol
[2:11:07] <dawarw0lf> Jack, tail, kasumi and mordin are the squishy ones
[2:11:09] <Sp3ctre48> @Scevda If she is that's news to me
[2:11:30] <Sp3ctre48> it always seemed like Mordin was the one that died for no reason
[2:11:32] <+Cactuskris> mordin is best send out with survivors
[2:11:32] <%GarbageNirvana> So how many people have died so far
[2:11:32] <+Scevda> Miranda
[2:11:35] <%dilly2lame> The crew members you get after the collector ship feel like they get less time to develop
[2:11:37] <GohansBeforeHohans> @Cactuskris I made that mistake first playthrough scjLaugh
[2:11:42] <+Scevda> 's plot armor is rediculous
[2:11:45] <TrollKing96> My grandad has been running with Kasumi and Grunt.
[2:11:45] <+Cactuskris> it dosent matter but at least he isnt ther to die
[2:12:05] <Sp3ctre48> You have to try really hard to kill Miranda it's great
[2:12:11] <dawarw0lf> @garbagenirvana No one, not even collectors
[2:12:13] <+Scevda> @TrollKing96 Huh, thats an interesting combo
[2:12:22] <%GarbageNirvana> oh dang
[2:12:23] <Vikingincognito> Put miranda in the themal pipe
[2:12:23] <peachy996> First time on this run, I got Grunt killed, Mordin died at the end and Jack wasn't loyal so she lived up to the Reaper Baby
[2:12:24] <%robosqueeb> miranda is lame but her model actress is my waifu
[2:12:36] <%teefpal> @Sp3ctre48 The very first time I beat ME2 back in 2011, mordin died. It was my first WRPG style game and it *gutted* me.
[2:12:39] <peachy996> So that's 3 of my favorite characters dead
[2:12:40] <+Cactuskris> there is a squad point system that lowers the survival of the 2nd team if you take all the heavy hitters away
[2:12:41] <dawarw0lf> Oh wait the collector ship might have had some on board
[2:12:44] <+trackles_64> Geefy has to much energy
[2:12:46] <%BlackStarAura> Because they knew people would be like “I hate him/her KILL ThEM”
[2:12:49] <captain_kirkhammer> @TrollKing96 Grunt, Samara, Legion, and Zaeed are the best. The rest of the team remind me of mall ninjas I've known.
[2:12:52] <+Scevda> @peachy996 jesus did you even try their loyalty missions? lol
[2:13:03] <%robosqueeb> I can't believe you can bungle so bad that even shepherd dies
[2:13:13] <%robosqueeb> imagine how pissed cerberus would be
[2:13:18] <peachy996> @Scevda I did but the problem was Jack and Miranda's argument
[2:13:21] <%andrewofbob> I somehow kept everyone alive first try, but I didn't save Kelly in 3
[2:13:26] <peachy996> It unloyals her
[2:13:33] <%teefpal> oh no im not done making my food
[2:13:36] <+Scevda> @robosqueeb Grunt
[2:13:41] <%Garthunox> GRUNT!

[2:14:15] <%robosqueeb> grunt is a good boy

[2:22:33] <peachy996> Like it's crazy how it HAS to be Mordin
[2:22:37] <dukenux> "That's how i always do it Garrus, slip inthe back"
[2:22:42] <+Scevda> The most obvious one
[2:22:42] <%ahomeschooldropout> Fun fact; if Miranda is taken by the seeker swarm she just comes back
[2:22:43] <Sp3ctre48> Best boy saved
[2:22:47] <%Lion_kun> FUCK YOU GAME, HOW WAS I SUPPSOED TO KNOW TO SEND MORIDIN
[2:22:48] <SaltyAzteca> I think I used Kasumi for that one
[2:22:50] <+Scevda> THE BACK DOOR
[2:22:50] <%ohno778> Grunt worked for me on the survivors
[2:22:52] <dawarw0lf> I did Jack for the lols
[2:22:52] <jorniev> why mordin?
[2:22:56] <%NopeBadguy> LEVEL CAP
[2:22:56] <%CalderGaming> the big Cerberus dump-off starts NOW
[2:22:58] <%Lion_kun> MISSED OUT ON THE BEST STORYLINE BECAUSE OF THAT BULLSHIT
[2:22:58] <%Treuan> Robo Gang
[2:22:59] <+Wolfstriker121> HERE IS THE GOOD MUSIC
[2:23:00] <Laecerelius> Robo fuck squad engage!
[2:23:01] <%JamesCorck> This is exactly the same way I do it in my game, good picks.
[2:23:01] <%andrewofbob> It doesn't have to be Mordin, but he's on the lowest tier for the final line
[2:23:03] <Sp3ctre48> @ahomeschooldropout Does she really?
[2:23:07] <%JoshManVGH> Max level achieved.
[2:23:07] <$SGrim> @Lion_kun SEND THE DOCTOR WITH THE INJURED PEOPLE
[2:23:09] <%JamesCorck> Oh shit, level 30.
[2:23:10] <%KishinGrek> fuck yeah, sexy Russian space lady and robot
[2:23:11] <+Cactuskris> it dosent have to be mordin squad mates needs to be loyal but mordin is weak so send him away from fights
[2:23:11] <+Scevda> She really didn't have to make it that big
[2:23:12] <SlimCognitoEntertainment> I'd let Samara beat the shit outta me
[2:23:13] <%walternatorz> reverse escort mission
[2:23:13] <jorniev> SHPPARD DID YOU PLAY WITCHER 2?
[2:23:14] <%machshop> if Revolver Ocelot were here he could just swing his guns at the collector bees
[2:23:15] <%GabeSweetMan> I did Jack for this as well. Worked out alright.
[2:23:17] <+senfood> oh my god she's so awesome and hot
[2:23:17] <%Garthunox> @Lion_kun Anyone works for sending them back
[2:23:17] <%HotSauceFiend> Zahir and kasumi have no dialogue at all in this section huh
[2:23:18] <+Scevda> she could have cut the radius by half
[2:23:18] <count_bob> Level up?
[2:23:30] <dukenux> i cant remember if i picked Samara or Jack for this.
[2:23:31] <%Lion_kun> I SENT THANE BECAUSE STEALTH
[2:23:31] <dawarw0lf> It should be him or tail, kasumi and jack
[2:23:32] <%bread_assassin> I only recently found out that Thane is one of the most useless members of the team when it comes to the Suicide mission.
[2:23:32] <+ScreamLord> @jorniev Because he more likely to die on the mission than most unless you send him back
[2:23:34] <Sp3ctre48> Jack and Samara are the correct options
[2:23:37] <+Dwarven_Gaming> would they DO anything to legion?
[2:23:38] <SaltyAzteca> ASSUMING CONTROL OF THE SWARM
[2:23:43] <%NopeBadguy> @HotSauceFiend They do in gameplay
[2:23:48] <peachy996> The reason this works for Samara too is because it's believable for a Justicar to do this shit slightly more than Jack who uses her Biotics to destroy rather than protect
[2:23:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Once you get near the end you can literally sprint to the cutscene trigger and be fine.
[2:23:49] <Latija> YOUR MILF CANNOT PROTECT YOU SHEPARD
[2:23:50] <+Cactuskris> @HotSauceFiend kasumi does if she is tech expert
[2:23:50] <%Lion_kun> If you don't send Moridin, Moridin dies.
[2:23:53] <%RealThiele> just get enough asari to envelop a whole ship in a biotic field and then CHARGE SHIT
[2:23:55] <+HefestoForges> this hurts the shepard
[2:23:56] <peachy996> But that's what makes the Jack pick so good too

[2:36:14] <peachy996> "They just saw a Kaiju Movie"
[2:36:15] <Mattais88> But all reapers are cuttlfish, so is the human reaper piloting a ship that looks like a shrimp?
[2:36:18] <Jmann1892> ISN'T THIS METAL SHEPARD
[2:36:18] <triangularblasphemy> THE ROBOT IS WRONG, I AM BUILDING A SHEPARD, SHEPARD
[2:36:19] <%Ynkubus_> CHICKS DIG GIANT ROBOTS SHEPARD
[2:36:19] <SaltyAzteca> Legion does not like this Reaper
[2:36:20] <+Wolfstriker121> HAVE YOU SEEN GUNDAM WING SHEPARD
[2:36:23] <+Scevda> GIVE EM THE OLE DICK TWIST
[2:36:23] <%teefpal> Isn't it to preserve the species they exterminate?
[2:36:23] <%Daxalog> This was every bossfight in the gen, No wonder darksouls took off
[2:36:24] <+vaderxyz1970> So how would it move in space like superman?
[2:36:25] <sgtbloopface> god the reapers are so petty
[2:36:28] <%Torus1025> It's always about labor
[2:36:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> SHEPARD DONT YOU DARE BRING MY MOM INTO THIS
[2:36:30] <%alternative_flu> it's time to kill da baby human reaper
[2:36:30] <mrtanaka111> THIS BOSS WAS A GOOD IDEA ON PAPER SHEPARD
[2:36:31] <%robosqueeb> the human reaper is pretty cool big t100 looking motherfucker
[2:36:31] <BigFingerRo> LOOK AT OUR COOL GIANT TERMINATOR SHEPARD
[2:36:31] <+ScreamLord> GET IN THE GIANT ROBOT SHEPARD
[2:36:32] <dekkitout> Get in the robot Shepard, or I'll make Tali do it
[2:36:34] <triangularblasphemy> I'M GOING TO LEVEL WITH YOU, I'M VERY FOND OF YOU SHEPARD
[2:36:38] <digaogrunge> Even Legion thinks this is fucked
[2:36:40] <Sp3ctre48> Now tbf, this human thing probably will be put into the core of the squid ship, but the fact that it exists like this is just so terrible
[2:36:42] <%Lion_kun> If you take miranda with you, you can get her killed in this section
[2:36:43] <peachy996> Like this makes so little sense with a reaper ship
[2:36:44] <wolverinewaswrong> Shepard should have piloted the human reaper in ME3
[2:36:45] <%GabeSweetMan> WHY ARE YOU CHECKING YOUR PHONE DURING THE BEST PART SHEPARD
[2:36:46] <%Ranryu692> DON'T GET ANY IN MY HAIR, SHEPARD
[2:36:46] <holyxgrale> Watch out he's all full up on human juice monkaS
[2:36:47] <%snow_bush> Your soul is still bound by Gravity shepard
[2:36:52] <Aiutare47> boy howdy does that plot detail get thrown away completely
[2:36:52] <dawarw0lf> Just nuke it and skip the boss fight please
[2:36:53] <+RowenCleric> i mean its kinda rad
[2:36:54] <+AmericanSkidd> EVA
[2:36:55] <$SGrim> WRONG

[2:36:57] <Jimsehy> THESE MEN ARE PAWNS
[2:36:57] <%Lion_kun> That's what I did and boy was it great not having to deal with her in 3
[2:36:58] <%teefpal> @triangularblasphemy "Really? I didn't notice."
[2:36:58] <IntrepidEye> So space Skynet made a giant T-800. nice i guess
[2:36:59] <+BigBruthaThunda> if reapers reaped several times, how come they only have like 2 shapes
[2:37:00] <%Shubreaker> GIEF
[2:37:01] <+ScreamLord> THIS IS HUMAN INSTUMENTALITY SHEPARD
[2:37:01] <triangularblasphemy> OKAY GOODBYE SHEPARD
[2:37:02] <$lotharrio> A thing that does not happen anywhere else.
[2:37:03] <wolverinewaswrong> LIE
[2:37:06] <+black_pariah> all reapers are made this way, they just usually are the leviathan shell
[2:37:07] <peachy996> Even if it existed in the core it would still look stupid
[2:37:08] <Tracazoid> Which is super odd since all the ones we see are the same
[2:37:08] <%RealThiele> APEX PREADTOR
[2:37:09] <dawarw0lf> Gift why!
[2:37:09] <%GabeSweetMan> THE BOY IS HUNGY SHEPARD

[2:37:24] <BigFingerRo> EXCUSE ME IF YOU HAVE PLACES TO BE, SHEPARD
[2:37:28] <homestylewaffles> @Tracazoid hanar reapers
[2:37:29] <+cermo55> Shepard killed a reaper and they said "We NEED ONE OF THOSE"
[2:37:30] <+redthebaron> it is cool that harbinger just let's you take your time before starting this
[2:37:31] <wolverinewaswrong> So all species in past cycles were just cuttlefishes?
[2:37:33] <%robosqueeb> pats just like "I should go"
[2:37:37] <peachy996> And did we not enter a Dead Reaper's Core to get the IFF?
[2:37:37] <Sp3ctre48> @BigBruthaThunda They have different designs in this game but ME3 cut those out
[2:37:38] <+ScreamLord> Look at all the human fart gas leaking out
[2:37:40] <%teefpal> Oh shit Gief blew up the White House
[2:37:41] <triangularblasphemy> @triangularblasphemy I'VE JUST... BEEN OUT OF THE DATING SCENE FOR AWHILE... BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC... SHEPARD

[2:37:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> WE WANTED TO MAKE IT A GIANT PICKLE SHEPARD
[2:37:58] <%RealThiele> cuttlefish were previously their strongest foe
[2:37:58] <%Monkeyweed21> @JoshManVGH they were supposed to be more unique but Bioware Magic
[2:37:59] <%cvp5127> I SENT YOU NUDES PLZ RESPOND SHEPARD
[2:37:59] <triangularblasphemy> replied to myself. Awesome.
[2:38:01] <blackjack8182> MOM SAID IT WAS MY TURN TO PLAY WITH THE XBOX SHEPARD
[2:38:02] <Wydamn> JoshManVGH Yeah, in ME3 I think they all have that cuttlefish shape, so that makes no sense unless every other speciies was a cuttlefish
[2:38:03] <mrtanaka111> geif is indocrinated
[2:38:09] <%Wurmspawn> Remember when it was revealed that this human reaper was supposed to resemble a human fetus? Then the age/content limitation people were like, yeah, no. That's not a good image.
[2:38:10] <+flexin_apex> The human juice is flowing and glowing
[2:38:14] <Ner234> He's grown too powerful
[2:38:16] <FeralFozzie> the collectors are just off screen. "do we attack him now? no he's in a cutscene"
[2:38:17] <BigFingerRo> @triangularblasphemy OOOOK LET'S NOT GET TOO REAL SHEPARD
[2:38:19] <%GabeSweetMan> YOU MUST AVOID THE NOID SHEPARD
[2:38:21] <+condemned_15> is your dog John K?

[2:38:23] <IntrepidEye> so whats the endgame here. if they finish it is it just going to be a giant skeleton flying through space?

[2:39:02] <%Treuan> You must survive
[2:39:02] <+AmericanSkidd> Harbinger is controlling the Zangief
[2:39:03] <%cade_calrayn> NO BEHAVE, ONLY DESTROY
[2:39:03] <tommyboy96> @Wurmspawn I could see a foetus floating with all the other squid boys

[2:39:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> SHEPARD YOURE LIKE 30 WHY ARE YOU SO BALD
[2:39:18] <+black_pariah> essence is genetics, eve tho that doesnt make sense
[2:39:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @Scevda you need A LOT of baby batter to make a reaper
[2:39:22] <%cade_calrayn> HE LEARNED IT FROM YOU, DAD
[2:39:25] <%Solid_Stro> Zangief “We Are Harbinger.” psaDogchamp
[2:39:26] <%RealThiele> they are building a reaper pilot LUL
[2:39:28] <dawarw0lf> Harbinger is controlling him
[2:39:29] <NetherTable> MAYBE IT IS NATURAL, MAYBE IT IS HUMAN ESSENCE SHEPHARD
[2:39:35] <tlflordhand> At this point the reaper origin stories from the books make no fucking sense

[2:39:57] <wolverinewaswrong> @tlflordhand There's a different one than the Organics/synthetics crap?
[2:39:58] <+Scevda> I like the theory that the skeleton would be inside a big ol crab shell space ship
[2:39:58] <%teefpal> ABORTION TIME
[2:40:02] <dekkitout> It's gotta be big enough where you can do a cool pose on its shoulder
[2:40:02] <%justnathan18> Fun fact: this reaper was originally supposed to be a baby.
[2:40:02] <%JamesCorck> It's Bioshock!

[2:40:46] <wolverinewaswrong> The ending of Earthbound basicallly
[2:40:47] <knight_verse> One Reaper is the total collection of the species it was made from, so however many Reapers there are means that that's how many species they harvested.
[2:40:50] <kevamadi> LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION SHEPARD

You get one last moment to see the cruel truth behind the Collectors, they were abused and created to server the reapers and in the end even that wasn't enough, the reapers STILL had to mentally control the collectors and when they finally "failed" they were just left to die.
[2:53:22] <%AncelDeLambert> or it could have doomed us all just like the relays

[2:55:43] <blackjack8182> The end

[2:57:12] <+ScatterCatt> Never thought about this before, but why is the human reaper the only one that doesn't look like a squid thing? There's no way that all of the previous species they wiped out were all squid based.
[2:57:13] <SaltyAzteca> Thane things, nice
[2:57:13] <Laecerelius> She doing the Thane bullshit
[2:57:15] <%Shubreaker> YOU ARE NOT OK

[2:57:36] <triangularblasphemy> God, can we go back, I wanna Harbinger meme again
[2:57:38] <%jackelzxaa> i wonder if the idea was the human reaper was supposed to go within a reaper hull crustacian thing
[2:57:38] <+OhioNitsud> did she sex a fish? what hapened?
[2:57:39] <peachy996> That's totally the camera angles for PTSD
[2:57:42] <%NitronStreams> Gonna need a LOOOOOOT of therapy for the crew
[2:57:43] <triangularblasphemy> I lost myself back there
[2:57:47] <+Bigbossman91> @ScatterCatt it wasn't finished yet that's why
[2:57:47] <%tank7013> I always took that to be a hint that she's part dreel
[2:57:49] <captain_kirkhammer> @ScatterCatt the devs explain that there's a techno-nightmare version of every assimilated species in the core of a reaper
[2:57:50] <dukenux> IT'S NEVAH OVAH
[2:57:50] <+flexin_apex> She had some of thane b4 she was taken
[2:57:53] <%Wurmspawn> @ScatterCatt The original idea was to make the human reaper look like a fetus, but content restrictions put a stop to that.
[2:57:54] <%andrewofbob> Collectors come back in ME3 multiplayer
[2:57:56] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> wait is that fucking seth green
[2:57:59] <%KishinGrek> Yay Seth green
[2:58:01] <Sp3ctre48> @ScatterCatt It's never confirmed but since it flying around like a superman would be too stupid even for Mass Effect, it'll probably be the core in one of the bigger ships
[2:58:03] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> JEFF
[2:58:07] <DSD24> @TrevyWeaponsGuy Yeah it is
[2:58:07] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> holy shit

[2:59:35] <%RealThiele> next step: big war crimes
[2:59:39] <+RowenCleric> 16 is like middlde aged for Salarian
[2:59:40] <ioci2112> isn't 16 like 50 for salarians, they only live until 40 years old
[2:59:42] <Mattais88> Salarians only live to 40 so 16 is like 45
[2:59:47] <tommyboy96> 16s 40ish?
[2:59:49] <+TheotherKristian> Remember 16 is like 40-50 in human comparison
[3:00:12] <KetsuoTaberu> neat
[3:00:18] <%BlackStarAura> Family family family
[3:00:18] <%GabeSweetMan> ~2.5x years compared to human years so 16 is like 40.
[3:00:24] <dawarw0lf> @realthiele No that’s later, time for shadow broker shenanigans
[3:00:29] <triangularblasphemy> "Yawning percieved as contagious in humans. Incorrect. Salarians responsible for all yawns."

[3:03:47] <%RealThiele> oh no ver voice is chasing you
[3:03:48] <dawarw0lf> I should go
[3:03:49] <+AmericanSkidd> Kasumi and Tali are totally gal pals
[3:03:50] <%bread_assassin> If you romance Miranda, Kasumi yells at you for fucking her at Tali's workstation.
[3:03:51] <%Lion_kun> I lost Solus and Miranda in my run.
[3:03:52] <fugly_nick> @nyacoo She was watching from stealth
[3:03:59] <dukenux> thanks mom
[3:04:02] <churropoppa> @teefpal cause cerberus are nazis and he's token

[3:04:19] <%RealThiele> thanks Pala-mom
[3:04:21] <emMmDeeKay> How about Zangief a.k.a. Grunt, your BIG son

[3:04:42] <+RyanTheRecluse> just dropped in, did he clear the base with no casualties?
[3:04:45] <+Cactuskris> had to do it to them
[3:04:47] <fugly_nick> I'm glad Miranda actually agrees with you here
[3:04:52] <SlimCognitoEntertainment> never hated a character more
[3:04:52] <dawarw0lf> What is there to do
[3:04:55] <BigFingerRo> @GalacticaPhanto "Oh yeah, that's totally part of his weird thing, the broccoli"
[3:04:56] <%andrewofbob> Surely Miranda has LESS work...
[3:04:57] <+trackles_64> failure
[3:05:00] <%NopeBadguy> TOTAL FAILuRE
[3:05:00] <peachy996> She quits if you take her with
[3:05:01] <+ScrapKingKeita> to sacrifice jacob
[3:05:03] <nyacoo> uh...
[3:05:04] <tattleworm> do the vods count as casualties
[3:05:05] <%teefpal> @teefpal Jacob being the Ben Carson makes too much sense. But doesn't that make Shepard a fascist sympathizer?
[3:05:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> for everyone to die
[3:05:11] <jbrachob> we expect you to erase all vods
[3:05:11] <dukenux> yeah i think all the crew agrees with blowing up the base
[3:05:12] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:05:12] <Sp3ctre48> TALK TO ME GARRUS

[3:05:17] <stormhawk9891> C A L I B R A T I O N S
[3:05:18] <dawarw0lf> It needs more garrus!
[3:05:22] <+Cactuskris> if you give him the base everybody is like are you stupid Shepard
[3:05:22] <%Ziegsy> no one wants to talk to Shepherd ;;
[3:05:23] <%NopeBadguy> Pat we've always expected total failure from you
[3:05:23] <+tinytinykittycat> lol
[3:05:25] <fugly_nick> @peachy996 Yeah taking her to the final boss leads to a really nice scene
[3:05:28] <%RealThiele> hey it worked out last time

[3:06:59] <jorniev> GETH ARE BASED
[3:07:07] <lloyddboy> geth roombas
[3:07:08] <%JoshManVGH> Awww!
[3:07:14] <dawarw0lf> It’s still the same. Remember it’s because of the Quarians that the Geth make the decision
[3:07:17] <DSD24> Don't forget Quarian's attack them all the time
[3:07:18] <$LightningLynx89> Geth are so lame
[3:07:27] <Sp3ctre48> Very difficult to pick a side in this conflict
[3:07:32] <GuyverTypeL> takes your planet and refuses to ellaborate further
[3:07:33] <dukenux> Geth are litteraly competely in moral right, desoite not caring for organic mirwlity
[3:07:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> It's crazy that Geth just wanted to be alive, whodve thunk it
[3:07:36] <dawarw0lf> I don’t blame the Geth in 3
[3:07:37] <%barrakuta371> I can't wait for Homeworld 3
[3:07:39] <dukenux> *morality
[3:07:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That's a dumb thing Legion said
[3:07:48] <+AmericanSkidd> Home is where you make it stupid organic
[3:07:49] <+ScrapKingKeita> Char pls
[3:07:49] <stormhawk9891> @Sp3ctre48 Not really
[3:07:50] <%teefpal> FOUND FAMILY
[3:07:52] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Someone's been showing legion the time-life channel
[3:07:53] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That's a smart thing Legion said
[3:07:55] <%dilly2lame> Geth did nothing wrong
[3:07:58] <+Ches_Neckbeard> that....was the best "home is where the heart is" ever
[3:08:03] <dukenux> Sorry Tali, i side with cool robot now
[3:08:04] <Mattais88> Legion spitting the hard truths
[3:08:08] <$LightningLynx89> @sp3ctre48 Nah man, put the Geth in the trash compactors
[3:08:11] <%BlackStarAura> I never got this convo
[3:08:13] <jorniev> THIS ROBOT IS ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT FAMILLY
[3:08:15] <Tracazoid> "We knocked those punks off the planet and didn't even keep it."
[3:08:21] <Sp3ctre48> @stormhawk9891 I was being sarcastic, it's not hard at all and that's the problem
[3:08:32] <BigFingerRo> HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS
[3:08:43] <dawarw0lf> It’s so adorable that the Geth still care about their creators
[3:08:43] <%KishinGrek> Did he say auschwitz?
[3:08:57] <Mattais88> yes, he did
[3:09:00] <williamrooster> can't side with the geth, quarrien pussy to good.
[3:09:01] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> so cool
[3:09:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> GODDAMN I LOVE LEGION
[3:09:03] <MexicanMau> yes
[3:09:08] <Sp3ctre48> At least there are valid arguments to both sides of the genophage argument, here the Geth are right and the Quarians are so goddamn stupid
[3:09:09] <%teefpal> @KishinGrek a lot of people died there and we memorialized it
[3:09:11] <peachy996> You love Geth so much why don't you marry one
[3:09:12] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> like robo vulcans without a stick up their ass
[3:09:14] <Tracazoid> The Geth, "why can we be cool" Quarians, "KILL THEM ALL!"
[3:09:14] <%JoshManVGH> Aww Geth. Geth are cool
[3:09:16] <AllenDeadman> Legion rules
[3:09:20] <fugly_nick> I got Legion killed on my first playthrough, I was so bummed
[3:09:21] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> what a cool robot
[3:09:22] <rekinom> Qussy got me acting strange
[3:09:23] <dawarw0lf> WHY DO PEOPE DECIDE TO KILL THEM ALL
[3:09:23] <PunchSlugfest> @williamrooster nah it's all about that gussy
[3:09:23] <%BlackStarAura> Good point, Legion
[3:09:25] <willyfreshness> So nuts how small the roster is in ME3
[3:09:25] <%jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt Heads up: The main 3 DLC missions are all as long as multiple normal missions, so you might want to plan for each dlc to take up a full stream
[3:09:25] <jorniev> I LOVE YOUR ENTIRE SPECIES
[3:09:28] <%RealThiele> i mean if i could fuck a robot id be down
[3:09:29] <+condemned_15> check the 2 crew members in the barracks
[3:09:30] <%GalacticaPhanto> Grunt loves it
[3:09:30] <$SGrim> @peachy996 He and I both would if we could.
[3:09:35] <dukenux> They're like a kid that still cares about their abusive parent :(
[3:09:37] <knight_verse> They are so cool... still pressing that destroy button real hard.
[3:09:37] <$LightningLynx89> Man fuck these AI bastard a I’m glad I destroy the Geth every chance I get
[3:09:42] <emMmDeeKay> How our BIG SON doin?
[3:09:44] <dukenux> das rite Grunt
[3:09:45] <Sp3ctre48> Has he not done Shadow broker yet?
[3:09:52] <$lotharrio> Grunt is so happy that he's approaching galactic apex predator.
[3:09:53] <jbrachob> You know grunt had a raging boner the hole time during the mision
[3:09:55] <triangularblasphemy> Grunt immediately sticks a gun into his own mouth, smiling like a madman
[3:09:57] <%jackelzxaa> also doing at least the first firewalker before overlord helps with consistency a little (really weird they let you access overlord before you get the vehicle)
[3:09:58] <BigFingerRo> talk to your purple waifu
[3:10:07] <%KishinGrek> They were killed psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp

[3:10:18] <ahaegotrigger> lmao
[3:10:20] <dawarw0lf> @jackelzxaa I don’t think a stream per dlc is required
[3:10:23] <dekkitout> Cause his tongue isn't min maxed for the toy?
[3:10:24] <+Scevda> ya but he is still food driven.
[3:10:25] <dukenux> and paper skin

[3:10:38] <dawarw0lf> It will only take one more stream
[3:10:38] <+AmericanSkidd> He can break his arm at people
[3:10:40] <%Ranryu692> that's why we put you there, and the reporter there next time
[3:10:41] <%JoshManVGH> What weapon? your busted ass rifle?

[3:15:10] <+dayz1003> so does the shadow broker dlc
[3:15:11] <%jackelzxaa> they're basically like feros or noveria without the town parts
[3:15:14] <%dilly2lame> Firewalker is inconsequential
[3:15:15] <%KishinGrek> No cuddle cringe
[3:15:17] <%jackelzxaa> 3 streams probably
[3:15:18] <dawarw0lf> Each take an hour or two
[3:15:20] <%Monkeyweed21> it will take 2 streams for all of it
[3:15:22] <Sp3ctre48> Overlord and arrival are pretty short I know that much
[3:15:25] <%jackelzxaa> firewalker is just a setup for overlord yeah
[3:15:28] <tanarath> Big snore
[3:15:29] <+ScreamLord> Firewalker doesn't matter
[3:15:30] <dukenux> Do Shadow Broker fiest
[3:15:30] <dawarw0lf> Shadow broker first
[3:15:32] <fugly_nick> Save Arrival for last definitely
[3:15:39] <knight_verse> Arrival is the shortest and that's saying something.
[3:15:43] <BigFingerRo> GIB ORB
[3:15:46] <%KishinGrek> Are thos FF14 expansions?
[3:15:50] <leinadtonu> never apologize for pooch
[3:15:51] <GuyverTypeL> yellow suits you good man
[3:15:52] <+Scevda> and its only gonna get worse
[3:15:53] <dawarw0lf> Honestly just skip firewalker
[3:15:54] <%jackelzxaa> they made the tank suck less in Legendary Edition. Originally it had like ZERO health and would die in 2 seconds. now it dies in FOUR seconds.
[3:15:57] <%ahomeschooldropout> Save Arrival for last then go straight to ME3 Kappa
[3:16:08] <tanarath> Big, big snore
[3:16:09] <%NopeBadguy> LOL
[3:16:10] <%RetroCop87> nice
[3:16:10] <$lotharrio> Oops
[3:16:12] <%GalacticaPhanto> rip
[3:16:15] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[3:16:15] <%Sol_Install> fucking damn
[3:16:16] <%IDTheftVictim> cheer500 aw why did you shut down that perfectly normal cuddle screen?
[3:16:16] <$apolitenoob> Rip
[3:16:18] <%KishinGrek> DM it
[3:16:21] <%blue8moon> unfortunate
[3:16:23] <+TheotherKristian> ince
[3:16:24] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> nice
[3:16:59] <fugly_nick> I would save Citadel for post game
[3:17:05] <BigFingerRo> Whenever you say thanka de peepo, I think of a time you got BUSTED in some other game and went "FUCKINEH SHITTUH
[3:17:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Javik is the best
[3:17:13] <dawarw0lf> @fugly_nick No
[3:17:18] <$lotharrio> I mean, Javik is the most interesting character so like... to hell with Freddy Prinze Jr.
[3:17:31] <%Ranryu692> @fugly_nick there is no post game, and it explicitly takes place before the ending
[3:17:37] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:17:37] <%KishinGrek> So why is Kanye on the Normandy?
[3:17:42] <$lotharrio> Off brand?
[3:17:48] <%jackelzxaa> citadel you can do in two parts because it opens a hub that's fun to return to between major missions. there's the first part and then the other part. i usually do the first part right away as soon as it lets me, and then i do the last part before the last mission. either way works and theres benefits to whichever way you do it.
[3:17:49] <dawarw0lf> @lotharrio Vega is better then Jacob or Kaiden
[3:17:49] <OldManDeckardCain> no speaking the truth then LLU
[3:18:03] <+Jay_Watching> that sounds hard to do
[3:18:06] <ExpressNode> He would only need the past year for that
[3:18:12] <%Monkeyweed21> pat smells and thinks Smash players deserve special treatment
[3:18:27] <%RetroCop87> Twin Peaks in fucking SOUL EATER?
[3:18:32] <stantheman_97> characterize YOU as an asshole?
[3:18:37] <%KishinGrek> Yup
[3:18:37] <$lotharrio> @dawarw0lf Not what I was suggesting. I imagine Pat will go for Garrus or Tali over Vega, though.
[3:18:38] <%teefpal> Too bad the Citadel Epilogue Mod isn't compatible with Legendary Edition
[3:18:41] <dawarw0lf> @ranryu692 no but it needs to be after the ending because happy endings only…lame
[3:18:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Twin Peaks is in SCOOBY DOO
[3:19:07] <%KishinGrek> Fuck That
[3:19:11] <%jackelzxaa> pat already deleted his channel so he can't be cursed by playing kingdom hearts
[3:19:15] <arkv01> kingdom hearts fans please LEAVE
[3:19:15] <%alternative_flu> there better or I swear to gawd
[3:19:15] <%Wallabri> for now......
[3:19:15] <Tracazoid> Pat filling in that Blazblue lore, truly a surprising twist
[3:19:15] <+Scevda> for limited time
[3:19:15] <%blue8moon> but will there
[3:19:17] <OldManDeckardCain> WILL THERE THO
[3:19:18] <$lotharrio> ...maybe
[3:19:19] <%IDTheftVictim> WILL THERE!
[3:19:20] <+D00msDayDan> wait pat saves vods of his streams?
[3:19:21] <dawarw0lf> @teefpal Too bad that the happy ending sucks
[3:19:21] <%Monkeyweed21> WILL THERE?
[3:19:22] <+Jay_Watching> i dont believe him
[3:19:23] <%za7az> sure there will
[3:19:23] <Mattais88> Will there though?
[3:19:26] <%RealThiele> Xi Qi Key Hearts done
[3:19:55] <%teefpal> @dawarw0lf I just use JAM or other less-cringey ending mods
[3:20:00] <%jackelzxaa> make a dummy save with the upgrades turned off and then try to get as many people killed as possble
[3:20:02] <%RetroCop87> KH3, where you have to buy the real ending for $40
[3:20:07] <%Puhff> nice, same
[3:20:18] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> not a regret in sight
[3:20:23] <%jackelzxaa> SHEPARD. I WILL DELETE YOUR VODS. THIS HURTS YOU.
[3:20:28] <%KishinGrek> I had rage moment for x blade in KH
