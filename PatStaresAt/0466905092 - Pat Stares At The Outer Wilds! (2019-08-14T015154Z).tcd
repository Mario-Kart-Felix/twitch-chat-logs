[0:40:12] <%Tennochief> now crash into the sun again
[0:40:14] <devanmuse> how much replay value is there to this game if the main hook is solving mysteries and puzzles? I imagine if you know exactly what you have to do, you could probably get everything done in this game in, like, twenty minutes?
[0:40:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone
[0:40:25] <+Addem_Up> @devanmuse pretty much none whatsoever, and yes
[0:40:31] <%ElenaManetta> It's kind of a pain in the ass to finish because it's so time based
[0:40:32] <%dekkitout> Isn't Sunless City a place in DSIII
[0:40:33] <%Estuko> @devanmuse hmm, yes
[0:40:33] <rytisone> The truth is out there
[0:40:34] <+go4thekneez> @devanmuse literally no replayability at all
[0:40:39] <%ElenaManetta> So you might be doing it for one or two more lives
[0:40:41] <Youwereeatenbyalid> big sunless city
[0:40:42] <%dekkitout> Or am I thinking Sunken City
[0:40:43] <%joylent_blue> without a dream in my hearrrrt

[0:43:06] <mrvidicus> Remember, there's a 8- 15 second delay before he can read chat
[0:43:06] <alrobot2014> i like how the quantum moon just pops in for a visit ever so often
[0:43:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie "Oh man! This monster/thing was sooooo scary! I can't even describe it! It was so nutso. I cannot emphasize enough how crazy it is! While also not saying what it was."

[0:45:42] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat what is this game all about? can you explain?
[0:45:43] <%ssjklyco> Objects are solid. don't fly into them
[0:45:49] <EntombedRaider> I would make Ellen Page at least bi LOL

[0:46:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat you need to hustle to do that
[0:46:16] <+Scevda> You took your sweet time
[0:46:18] <+Addem_Up> @arfsm95 Explore a solar system and discover a hidden mystery as to why you're playing Majora's Mask
[0:46:19] <+go4thekneez> @croxeye every 22 minutes the sun goes super nova, and you have to figure out why while stuck in a time loop
[0:46:21] <+gutlesscoward> sonic's the name, speed's your game
[0:46:22] <mrvidicus> Fuck I forgot how much I love this fuckin soundtrack.

[0:46:24] <+KenSmi> Reset
[0:46:25] <cache_22> You did spend about 2 minutes looking for the shortcut.
[0:46:26] <$correctedsun117> Pat, you need big speedrun strats to get there
[0:46:28] <+Bluemanzee> Ghost Matter is just Fart Gas
[0:46:30] <EntombedRaider> @mrvidicus Yup, my birth name is David Cage and I created those awesome games
[0:46:31] <%ElenaManetta> That's what makes me think you can only choose one or two doors unless there are secret paths to get the "one trip achievement"
[0:46:32] <+jjhoho> if u knew where to look you could be there super fast dw
[0:46:32] <GlassBird> you DID take a while to find the entrance
[0:46:33] <EuropanLamprey> You don't need to be fast, you just need to not be lost
[0:46:34] <%ChaosAethr> this music is great
[0:46:34] <Deekman> Late game puzzle. Go faster
[0:46:39] <+arfsm95> @Addem_Up yeah, i see majora's there
[0:46:41] <%dekkitout> Saaaand! Curse you and your gravity bound behavior
[0:46:41] <%ElenaManetta> Or unless you just BLAZE through it on purpose
[0:46:44] <Monkeyweed21> you did it
[0:46:49] <LodiFrostbeard> he's been there right?
[0:46:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> what's ghosts got to do with it
[0:46:53] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat Stepping Stone Cave is how you got up the Anglerfish's skull
[0:46:55] <%joylent_blue> play the song of inverted time to slow it down
[0:46:56] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat what is this game all about? can you explain??
[0:47:07] <%croxeye> @elenamanetta the only thing you need to beat the game is knowledge
[0:47:09] <hassanico1> @arfsm95 space exploration for lore
[0:47:10] <+Addem_Up> Did you go to the temple, Pat?
[0:47:13] <%aimlesshealer> @arfsm95 This game is about roasting marshmallows
[0:47:17] <$ZE_Count> missed the temple pat
[0:47:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat stepping stone cave is the path to the anglerfish, anglerfish district has the writing with the kids, eye shrine had a bunch of religious stuff about the eye
[0:47:21] <mrvidicus> "We're meeting in the Fossil Fish cave to play the game!" It's TIME TO PLAY THE GAME!
[0:47:22] <TheMorilo> Is this game worth it even if I already know some of the twists?
[0:47:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @arfsm95 explore space
[0:47:23] <Monkeyweed21> no you haven't
[0:47:27] <ssks123> did you do the place with the ghost matter?
[0:47:27] <EntombedRaider> Rub Pat’s Hot Tum Tum For Good Luck and Prosperity
[0:47:27] <+Addem_Up> Go to the Temple
[0:47:27] <%Piemen99> @arfsm95 escape the room with planetts
[0:47:29] <LodiFrostbeard> missing the temple of the eye
[0:47:30] <%corepool> no
[0:47:30] <%starotter70> Space
[0:47:31] <$correctedsun117> It's about SPACE
[0:47:31] <%nmaten> spaaaaaaaceeeee
[0:47:32] <WeebFever> Leanring
[0:47:34] <AirlineFood74> @arfsm95 it's like an escape room but video game
[0:47:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's about FAMILY, and that's what makes it so powerful
[0:47:34] <WeebFever> nice
[0:47:35] <thegreenbenis> SPACE
[0:47:37] <Endocrom> Aww, little kids writing is kinda janky. also Little kid skeleton
[0:47:38] <Futurecity10> entropy
[0:47:38] <$Brother_Coduss> @arfsm95 you seen Groundhog Day? it's groundhog day in space
[0:47:41] <%joylent_blue> arfsm95 if you have any interest in playing the game, leave and play it without knowing anything
[0:47:44] <%ssjklyco> Existential Dread
[0:47:44] <%Mr_Pylon> I don't think you've seen the Eye Shrine here yet
[0:47:44] <%Verd_254> nothing more needs to be said

[0:47:46] <+jjhoho> @themorilo stop watching now, play it, watch the vods
[0:47:46] <+go4thekneez> @TheMorilo probably not
[0:47:50] <%Tennochief> go back and read
[0:47:51] <+JacktheMan18> Star Trek*
[0:47:51] <+arfsm95> aight, thanks guys
[0:47:52] <ShichiNoBushi> Yaaaaay! You said "solar system" and not "galaxy"!
[0:47:58] <Youwereeatenbyalid> good description tbh
[0:47:58] <%ElenaManetta> Exploring a mini universe that is stuck in a time loop and discovering the secrets of how and why
[0:47:59] <$ssamjangg> Why am i getting motion sickness from this? I never get motion sickness :(
[0:48:00] <+jjhoho> that's what I did a couple episodes ago
[0:48:01] <%ElenaManetta> Maybe?
[0:48:02] <ScreamLord> Think No Man's Sky, but deep
[0:48:04] <%ElenaManetta> Without giving away spoilers?
[0:48:05] <Deekman> It is a solar system
[0:48:06] <%MassConnect> the construction in montreal appears to be in a time loop
[0:48:09] <+jjhoho> extremely worth it
[0:48:11] <ShichiNoBushi> You said "galaxy" before.
[0:48:15] <+PanicSwytch> To go where no pat or elmo has gone before
[0:48:16] <+go4thekneez> no one who has any interest in playing this should watch someone play it imo
[0:48:18] <$ZE_Count> Eye shrine
[0:48:19] <EuropanLamprey> Woolie kept saying galaxy
[0:48:20] <+linSP> this game is all your space fears
[0:48:21] <EntombedRaider> I died 10 years ago: I’m currently a shitty ghost
[0:48:22] <Junkles> part smart
[0:48:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> This could honestly be a Star Trek episode
[0:48:24] <+Addem_Up> Go to the eye shrine!
[0:48:29] <jaylabrando> Hi wut i miss
[0:48:31] <hassanico1> Pat hasn't been to Energy Lab yet right?
[0:48:32] <Zombrocom> Technically a Star System, since it doesn't orbit Sol.
[0:48:34] <%starotter70> YOU BROKE IT
[0:48:39] <+Grayhammatter> you SOILED it
[0:48:39] <%joylent_blue> uhhh
[0:48:39] <%Gray_skies1993> I can see it @GarbageQueenEllie
[0:48:39] <$correctedsun117> No Man's Sky had it backwards, you don't need multiple galaxies to make space interesting
[0:48:41] <%StripesUltimateEdition> whoooops
[0:48:43] <%nmaten> can you?
[0:48:43] <ShichiNoBushi> Spooky ghosts?

[0:48:55] <EntombedRaider> Break ‘em Pat! DO IT
[0:48:55] <+Addem_Up> GOOD JOB
[0:48:55] <cache_22> If type passes along enough and this becomes the last star would that make the solar system it's own galaxy?
[0:48:55] <GlassBird> its fine,
[0:48:56] <%Teintstein> rest in power
[0:48:57] <Medo3G> you could turn off the stuff you're already been to
[0:48:58] <+Shadicara> LUL
[0:48:58] <%MassConnect> if you watch reruns, every Star Trek episode is a time loop
[0:48:58] <kane21601> big stumbo
[0:48:59] <EuropanLamprey> INTO THE PIT YOU GO
[0:49:01] <Buttku> Hi gang, hope everyone had a good day

[0:49:05] <%dekkitout> Saaaaand!! apatFist
[0:49:06] <+Addem_Up> Pat flew directly into the sand
[0:49:07] <%Estuko> spooks WutFace
[0:49:11] <EntombedRaider> INTO THE BRAD PITT YOU GO
[0:49:17] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat so, what secrets have you discovered?
[0:49:20] <$correctedsun117> GO BACK
[0:49:23] <+Addem_Up> Go back to the corpse
[0:49:24] <$Brother_Coduss> crawl through the sand like the scrublord you are!
[0:49:25] <Youwereeatenbyalid> That fucking rock pile fixing itself scared the shit out of me
[0:49:41] <+Addem_Up> There's a secret by that one corpse on the bed
[0:49:42] <mrvidicus> Is the implication that these skeletons died from suffocation when sand spilled on them? Because FUCK THAT.
[0:49:53] <+JacktheMan18> It sucks that you have limited fuel in your suit.
[0:49:53] <+Addem_Up> @mrvidicus it's even worse actually
[0:49:55] <kane21601> wow a door that actually works for once
[0:49:58] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @mrvidicus no they all died from the ghosts
[0:50:00] <%ssjklyco> Why are the corpses missing clothes? who looted them
[0:50:02] <JojoPiero> @mrvidicus Nah it wsa something else entirely
[0:50:03] <%starotter70> Walk in
[0:50:03] <%Tennochief> Imagine using Quantum Imaging to hack your way into invulnerability in a fight
[0:50:03] <$ZE_Count> gotta fly good
[0:50:04] <+arfsm95> are there enemies or just straight up puzzles all the way?
[0:50:04] <+jjhoho> Pat once you get sanded out of here, it's worth it to explore what the sand uncovered rather than just meditate
[0:50:05] <+JacktheMan18> Kinda feel like there's a risk for getting stuck
[0:50:08] <mrvidicus> OOooooohhhh
[0:50:09] <%joylent_blue> GHOST MATTER
[0:50:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Did they try eating the sand?
[0:50:15] <+gutlesscoward> ghost matter is such a cool name
[0:50:15] <%Estuko> monkaS
[0:50:16] <%starotter70> Spooky Gas
[0:50:18] <%Gray_skies1993> NICE
[0:50:24] <%ElenaManetta> This one house looks SO specific but has nothing in it and it bothers me.
[0:50:25] <+go4thekneez> @mrvidicus all the aliens died from spooky crystals from a meteor
[0:50:25] <%dekkitout> That room is coated in the space cummies

[0:50:43] <%Estuko> GRANT US EYES
[0:50:43] <+nawji> You've been to the temple on Brittle Hollow
[0:50:44] <flyingavocadosofdoom> The floor is spooky
[0:50:45] <$correctedsun117> Playing this right after watching Chernobyl made the Ghost Matter a lot more terrifying
[0:50:46] <EntombedRaider> Ghosts Shit A Lot
[0:50:46] <hassanico1> No you didn't
[0:50:47] <Monkeyweed21> thats wrong pat
[0:50:48] <+Addem_Up> There are a few enemies that are the absolute worst to fight

[1:02:52] <mrvidicus> I fucking love this kind of level design. Narrow ruins and corridors that spread into a labyrinth, where something new is discovered in such a confined area constantly. It's my favorite thing about Arkham Asylum.

[1:09:20] <+StoweCo> This game has easily become my favorite game of 2019
[1:09:22] <@commanderclaw> Not a bug
[1:09:23] <Daxalog> Dooom Billboard particles
[1:09:24] <Zombrocom> More an oversight
[1:09:25] <+MellowMute> Not a bug
[1:09:25] <ShichiNoBushi> 2D texture animation?
[1:09:27] <+RoboBro1212> fun fact: even melee has a similar effect if you pause the game
[1:09:27] <$ZE_Count> some good ASMR
[1:09:28] <%Verd_254> not so much a bug as it is just a jpg
[1:09:28] <%aimlesshealer> Aw yeah, flat texture
[1:09:29] <+Addem_Up> Just how the unity works
[1:09:29] <+titans_ace_jerid> It's just a falling texture, not a bug.
[1:09:29] <+SammyOVision> Pat that's not a bug... that's billboarding
[1:09:30] <Monkeyweed21> just a rendering technique
[1:09:31] <filialpails> it's just billboarding
[1:09:31] <Cranky_Construct> its just a 2d plane to save from using a particle engine
[1:09:31] <%PauliusMaximus> im pretty sure it's just a2d texture
[1:09:32] <$correctedsun117> I wouldn't say bug, just an unfortunate reality of particle physics
[1:09:33] <Medo3G> not really a bug
[1:09:34] <+nawji> I think it's just a perspective trick that doesn't work from inside the stream
[1:09:34] <+earthboy2k> it's just a 2d sprite
[1:09:36] <Rosy_Joan> Thats actually a standard Unity Engine asset
[1:09:38] <%MachoMadnesss94> no its a feature
[1:09:40] <JojoPiero> ur a bug

[1:09:49] <%ElenaManetta> Do you want them to animate EVERY PARTICLE OF SAND
[1:09:50] <EuropanLamprey> Jpeg Dog was actually a bug
[1:09:51] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Is that a texture? Must be a bug
[1:09:51] <+Grayhammatter> Jpeg dog = bug

[1:24:21] <%ElenaManetta> So I didn't quite get what this was hinting at, but was it suggesting they are making suns explode into supernovas and harnessing their energy?
[1:24:22] <+Addem_Up> Redirect the energy
[1:24:24] <$ZE_Count> remember to go back to the bottom
[1:24:25] <flyingavocadosofdoom> Go downstairs

[1:25:05] <$ZE_Count> use the cores
[1:25:09] <Deekman> Did warp cores
[1:25:10] <+SammyOVision> Pat the cores

[1:28:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @haveswordmuststing speaking of, there was one point in the game where I figured "Yeah if they delete my save file here I wouldn't be mad"

[1:28:31] <%StripesUltimateEdition> I need to clip that hold on

[1:28:34] <%dekkitout> @SleepyMaribo Yep
[1:28:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> To get to the black hole forge you have to get on the Ash Twin
[1:28:37] <%Tennochief> it's hard to explain

[1:28:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 28m.
[1:28:39] <+FyteSoulstone> Goof job pat you not only died you destroyed everything before you exisited and after as well
[1:28:40] <hassanico1> Black Hole Forge and Ash Twin is all that's left?
[1:28:40] <LodiFrostbeard> @mankeyfigh remove the core while there are 2 signals
[1:28:40] <+Addem_Up> @mankeyfigh When something enters a black hole,it comes out of a white hole slightly before it enters
[1:28:41] <%Verd_254> @thefishofwar The prob comes out of the white hole before entering, Pat unplugged the white hole core before it could finish entering meaning he created matter and had duplicate probes, breaking spacetime.
[1:28:41] <Monkeyweed21> ash twin is all thats left
[1:28:41] <$Micome> Pat dabbed too hard
[1:28:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Man, fuck Spacetime. That shit is weak, bro
[1:28:43] <+go4thekneez> he took out the black hole while there were two drones out due to space time shit.
[1:28:44] <rytisone> Pat invented Half Life 3

[1:28:47] <%Ferakin> @AngriestPat It's been at least 10 runs Pat, I'll fill out Tank and Ninja before this is over
[1:28:47] <%Scarnehu> baba ceases to BEEEEE
[1:28:49] <+EthorXL> he removed a warp core when there were two scouts at once @mankeyfigh
[1:28:50] <Blurredborderlines> Ha created a paradox by having the same object exist twice symultaneously
[1:28:51] <%PROUD2beGINGER> That is the BEST and scariest thing I've seen in this game
[1:28:52] <+jjhoho> I think you take out one of the warp cores? while your Scout is going thru or something
[1:28:53] <+Addem_Up> @mankeyfigh Pat made something exist in two places at once
[1:28:53] <+go4thekneez> making a paradox
[1:28:53] <mrvidicus> AHAHA

[1:29:03] <TylerTjd> @AngriestPat did we get into the black hole forge yet?
[1:29:05] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> Maybe the black and white holes are in and out gates of parallel universes? I'm not sure what purpose it would serve but the ability to teleport briefly to a supercondensed version of your universe and then back out would make long distance travel easier
[1:29:05] <LodiFrostbeard> nice flying champ
[1:29:05] <$Audega> It's fineeee

[1:29:21] <+jjhoho> the nomai had ethics
[1:29:23] <+nawji> @AngriestPat remember that as you're learning all this shit you're unlocking more conversation options with the other Hearthian astronauts
[1:29:25] <+SammyOVision> Cracked glass is FINE in a vacuum pressure difference...
[1:29:25] <%starotter70> @mankeyfigh The probe comes out the white hole before entering the black hole, so if he removed the black hole before the probe goes into it then 2 of the same probes exist simultaneously
[1:29:27] <+jjhoho> And no save games
[1:29:29] <%Louie_Salmon> I am going to need to look at the visual effect of the universe breaking again, I couldn't even tell what I was looking at
[1:29:31] <+go4thekneez> now wait :)
[1:29:31] <+jpivot> @EuropanLamprey probably for the best they didnt, or else we wouldnt have spacetime fabric
[1:29:35] <+Addem_Up> The Nomai were smart enough to not destroyeverything
[1:29:37] <$ZE_Count> yep its a wait
[1:29:39] <+floralkami> @checkmydubsskrub it makes longer distances easier

[1:30:18] <Mendin> "hit" teh sun station he says

[1:30:39] <LodiFrostbeard> @Youwereeatenbyalid might aswell hit the sun more like lol
[1:30:40] <mrvidicus> Give Elmo the brushies.
[1:30:40] <GlassBird> go for it dude, i believe in you! it is a hard landing though
[1:30:41] <%Verd_254> landing on the sun station is difficult.
[1:30:42] <%Gray_skies1993> Ember Twin's like "sup bro"
[1:30:44] <chikensandwich> your gonna hit the sun alright
[1:30:44] <%Tennochief> EYEBALL IT

[1:30:51] <+nawji> this gon be good
[1:30:51] <+go4thekneez> you get an achievement if you land on the sun station normally it's super difficult
[1:30:52] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriespat untargetable
[1:30:53] <+Addem_Up> You aren't supposed to land there
[1:30:54] <EuropanLamprey> CHASE IT
[1:30:54] <kane21601> you get an achievement for landing on this thing
[1:30:54] <castlerock42> Time to hit the sun (station).
[1:30:54] <Naoyin> im gonna be real surprised if he lands on it like this
[1:30:55] <+StoweCo> @yeeyeyee do you know what I'm reffering to?
[1:30:56] <%This_is_Marco> que interstellar music
[1:30:57] <b_ikki> he'll do it no problem
[1:30:58] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> I haven't seen any crops or any form of nutrient ingestion from these three eyed freaks so maybe they had pocket agriculture dimensions that linked directly to their stomachs?
[1:30:58] <SpaceGuntank> i give pat a 20% to actually make the landing
[1:30:58] <GlassBird> you got this!
[1:30:59] <alrobot2014> autopilot?
[1:31:00] <+yeeyeyee> if you can do this i'll donate $200
[1:31:00] <+MellowMute> Only real astronauts can land on this launchpad 😎
[1:31:01] <%dekkitout> Approach it from retrograde?
[1:31:02] <filialpails> go the other way!
[1:31:02] <Jolnir> cmonBruh

[1:31:11] <+yeeyeyee> @StoweCo i do, but letting him figure it out will be more fun
[1:31:13] <Deekman> Did you not read the high energy walls?
[1:31:14] <LodiFrostbeard> over/under he yeets himself into the sun?
[1:31:15] <%Scarnehu> dig space up
[1:31:17] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat put it like this: There is an achievement for landing on it
[1:31:17] <%seylumiue> How can this be

[1:31:49] <cjsugar> whooooooo
[1:31:49] <%MachoMadnesss94> @AngriestPat it IS possible to manually land on the sun station but it is VERY difficult and you get an achievement for it
[1:31:49] <+JacktheMan18> nice
[1:31:50] <+yeeyeyee> @StoweCo they nerfed it in the patch so it's easier to figure out now, i think pat can do it
[1:31:50] <$Brother_Coduss> mooooooom, the celestial bodies are bullying me make them stoooop~
[1:31:51] <+jjhoho> shhhhh chat
[1:31:51] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You should probably try something else
[1:31:51] <+SammyOVision> Did you see the warp pad on top of the sun station before you crashed into the sun?
[1:31:54] <%galaxyswirl> can we get emote mode
[1:31:55] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> I hypothesis you'll need to warp to the sun collector
[1:31:55] <+yeeyeyee> @StoweCo but same actually
[1:31:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat you have to teleport on it it has a teleporter
[1:31:56] <rytisone> Sun is the biggest bully

[1:32:32] <%mankeyfigh> @angriestpat Apparently there’s an achievement for landing ON IT

[1:32:59] <mrvidicus> Just don't blurt out shit though, have some self control so we don't all have to go emote mode.
[1:33:02] <+jjhoho> yeah I'm all in for emote only mode
[1:33:04] <+go4thekneez> didnt they add the ability to wait at camp fires in the most recent patch?

[1:49:10] <Regret_rookie> TRY TO ROLL WITH THE FALL
[1:49:10] <+Addem_Up> @nademonkey1100 yes hedid

[1:49:22] <%Tennochief> No idea
[1:49:27] <+go4thekneez> gotta wait like 8 minutes per loop for all the sand to vanish it's real not great
[1:49:28] <+meatxsteam> You guys are genuine bullies. Pat's gonna cry tonight cause you called him Cumbo
[1:49:29] <garbageheaphound> fuck yeah there is more to explore
[1:49:29] <+Addem_Up> @rjshnozz big secret there
[1:49:32] <+jjhoho> @saltima it gets hinted at
[1:49:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Really, though, Pat, I didn't mean to call you 'cumbo'. That was a mistype
[1:49:34] <%TaifuDragon> Cumbo
[1:49:39] <%wsintai> @rjshnozz Chat's been bad about backseating tonight
[1:49:40] <%Louie_Salmon> @rjshnozz Because the value of this game can be ruined in single sentences
[1:49:41] <kane21601> @AngriestPat if you wanna explore ash twin, you might wanna sleep at a campfire
[1:49:42] <GlassBird> because people are giving big spoils and we want to bury their comments
[1:49:46] <jacob2996> @Stebdavee Beyond Two Souls is boring with a second playthrough, it's just railroading you up until the literal ending.
[1:49:46] <+OkamiDude15> Cumbo sfhTHINK
[1:49:46] <implied_consent> @go4thekneez You don't need to wait for the sand to vanish.

[1:52:58] <castlerock42> Such a majestic ship, flying off like that.
[1:52:59] <+OperatorPlease> did he just start investigating the twins btw
[1:53:00] <mrvidicus> I feel like you could totally jetpack to the sun station from here if you planned it well enough.
[1:53:04] <MyNameIsRasus> waiting on the twins is my least favorite part of this game
[1:53:07] <+jjhoho> just started ash
[1:53:08] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Youwereeatenbyalid no but seriously there's nothing of value to see there and I'm not sure why they're in the game
[1:53:09] <itesket> How long has pat been going
[1:53:10] <thegreenbenis> JET PACK TO STATION
[1:53:17] <+jjhoho> u can beat the game shipless
[1:53:18] <Monkeyweed21> this is the ember twin towers
[1:53:20] <%Mr_Pylon> try following the sand
[1:53:20] <+wydamn> That is correct, Pat
[1:53:23] <garbageheaphound> i dont think so
[1:53:23] <%mankeyfigh> @operatorplease nah, did ember twin last stream
[1:53:23] <+jjhoho> it's a speedrun cat
[1:53:26] <%Louie_Salmon> @mrvidicus That would be nothing short of a miracle
[1:53:32] <+jpivot> take a nap next to chert next time
[1:53:34] <LodiFrostbeard> @itesket like an hour or so, not much progress tho
[1:53:39] <thegreenbenis> Neat
[1:53:40] <+ImpHelpSingIt> whats our ETA here boys?
[1:53:42] <mrvidicus> @Louie_Salmon Never give me the odds.
[1:53:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> He come the sand
[1:53:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I wonder if pat will end up "
[1:53:46] <+Addem_Up> Pat, remember that the towers all look like theplanets they warp to
[1:53:48] <hassanico1> at east 5 minutes
[1:53:51] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I wonder if pat will end up "sequence breaking" this bit
[1:53:52] <+SammyOVision> Pat please, the sand, you're giving me anxiety standing here.
[1:53:53] <+Addem_Up> What do these towers look like?
[1:53:55] <$ZE_Count> thres like three or four buildings to see here I think
[1:53:56] <+earthboy2k> I'm getting really dizzy
[1:53:59] <+OperatorPlease> @mankeyfigh i missed an entire stream of confused pat?! damn it
[1:54:01] <%Tennochief> look at our ship, what a fucking champ
[1:54:02] <%starotter70> Here comes the big Cumbo
[1:54:02] <%DedlokPM> ***
[1:54:10] <+yeeyeyee> has pat even been to the sun station?
[1:54:11] <%aimlesshealer> That sand pillar's girth makes me shudder
[1:54:12] <+wydamn> You're getting dizzy now, imagine playing this in VR
[1:54:17] <mrvidicus> His ship goes inside of the planet's core. Is there a zone in there, I wonder?
[1:54:19] <Finchit> wow thats fucking awesome
[1:54:19] <MaxXtreme23> i hope pat has a plan for his oxygen and fuel
[1:54:20] <+jjhoho> no
[1:54:28] <+ssulcer> how long has the stream been up?
[1:54:28] <LodiFrostbeard> @wydamn puke induceing
[1:54:30] <+SammyOVision> Go around the equator and look at the rest of the stuff around?
[1:54:32] <ZetaPulse> poke
[1:54:35] <implied_consent> @angriestpat reading more lore will answer your questions about the warp towers.
[1:54:35] <Finchit> imagine if no man's sky was this interesting
[1:54:36] <kane21601> no it is
[1:54:36] <%mankeyfigh> Plans shams
[1:54:38] <MyNameIsRasus> man those ar some tilted towers. good thing us alpha gamers can rise
[1:54:39] <itesket> This game in vr would be a nightmare
[1:54:39] <Monkeyweed21> yes it is pat
[1:54:45] <GlassBird> as someone who almost never gets motion sick, id love this in vr
[1:54:45] <%MachoMadnesss94> i'm back, has he been stumboing?:
[1:54:49] <KingVantq> @ssulcer started actually playing a bit over an hr ago
[1:54:52] <%Reveresao> I think the new patched image they put in for ash twin is worse than the dende original.
[1:54:54] <+jjhoho> thanks I tilted them myself
[1:54:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> yeah
[1:54:56] <+Saltima> what do these pillars resemble?
[1:54:57] <$ZE_Count> look aorund that building pat
[1:55:00] <+Scevda> Did you just gaslight yourself?
[1:55:01] <CheckMyDubsSkrub> This game but with irl oxygen systems
[1:55:05] <%Bad1uck> If only Pat understood how sand works
[1:55:07] <+Addem_Up> What do these buildings look like?
[1:55:11] <+ssulcer> @KingVantq good to know, ill catch the vod later then
[1:55:13] <+linSP> HERE WE GO
[1:55:18] <kane21601> you would think they would build it in the place the GIANT KILLER SAND PILLAR is not
[1:55:18] <MaxXtreme23> difficult jumping puzzle time
[1:55:25] <CherrieVelvet> the cactus room!
[1:55:34] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @MaxXtreme23 you did it as a jumping puzzle? LUL
[1:55:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> My cactus bois
[1:55:46] <MaxXtreme23> yes, but it was too late in the loop, and i couldnt warp in time
[1:55:50] <$Audega> It's not a jumping puzzle? lol
[1:55:54] <MaxXtreme23> i only found the real solution later lol
[1:55:55] <Rosy_Joan> a power source so dangerous you can break spacetime Kappa

[1:56:29] <%Verd_254> no way, eh
[1:56:30] <+yeeyeyee> @mrvidicus the sand goes back and forth, they grew while the sand was on ember twin
[1:56:30] <hassanico1> not fucked
[1:56:35] <kane21601> oh pat is fucked
[1:56:35] <MyNameIsRasus> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE GUYS

[1:56:54] <Youwereeatenbyalid> how...CAN..THIS.BEEE
[1:56:55] <+yeeyeyee> @mrvidicus that same species of cactus is on ember twin, which probably means they seeded from one to the other

[1:57:18] <Mendin> Patt the black hole cores exist for a reason
[1:57:19] <+Addem_Up> Pat there's too much sand
[1:57:23] <+jjhoho> sand blocking the pad
[1:57:23] <MaxXtreme23> pat remember what that thing in the high energy lab said?
[1:57:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I know the game isn't exactly super realistic, but the fact that the sand-pillar is the only thing falling into the other twin bothers me
[1:57:23] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Look at all the trees
[1:57:24] <%starotter70> All that Sand Oxygen
[1:57:25] <%Reveresao> you have to be standing on the black hole pad @angriestpat
[1:57:29] <kane21601> pat the pad needs to be present

[1:57:38] <mrvidicus> Nonono, I get that. But I mean the way it was all clustered together in that specific room. I get silly about details like that in a game.

[1:58:09] <%Tennochief> interesting
[1:58:10] <jacob2996> I think how it works is that you need to stand close to the warp core for it to work.
[1:58:14] <$ZE_Count> Time to leanr pat

[1:59:46] <$MetalPanic> this is less randomly generated than the entirety of Yakuza
[1:59:47] <+SammyOVision> Nope, the game devs were VERY aggressively advertising the fact that the system was HAND CRAFTED in promos.
[1:59:47] <MaxXtreme23> isn't the quantum moon randomly generated to a small extent?

[2:12:19] <mrvidicus> I dunno guys. I feel like he was so close that one time, and it's kind of unfair he didn't get the answer.
[2:12:19] <%dekkitout> Anyone got a campfire song?

[2:12:26] <$correctedsun117> @AngriestPat if only you had something ROUGH and COARSE to protect you from the cactus

[2:12:48] <not_twitter_rowan> remember how you GOT to the High Energy lab?
[2:12:48] <+Addem_Up> There were some you couldn't jump.

[2:13:19] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat they're in order of orbit, by the way
[2:13:20] <$Dakuu75> shouldn't your big-meaty space-boots be able to tank a few cactus needles?
[2:13:21] <+Onivino> Clearly he should stay far away from cacti

[2:15:35] <Deekman> It’s the first building to uncover
[2:15:35] <%Reveresao> follow the tower of sand
[2:15:38] <+nawji> There is a middelground pat. Get into the room before it's completely empty

[2:15:45] <+Onivino> You can leave the solar system if you disable the autopilot
[2:15:46] <MaxXtreme23> you actually can get to the probe, i've done it
[2:15:46] <chikensandwich> just jump over it!!!
[2:15:47] <Shiranui24> You can find the room with sand

[2:15:58] <%HeadsHeldHigh> sandy cheeks
[2:15:58] <MaxXtreme23> but there's no real acknowledgement for it
[2:15:59] <GlassBird> im having as much fun watching people try to yell over each other with explanations as watching pat try to guess what they're saying

[2:30:39] <+MidnightBurst12> 4 mins. good luck
[2:30:39] <+yeeyeyee> What is the absolute most energy you can get at once? The nergy of a supernova, a million nuclear explosions going off at once
[2:30:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> on Porpoise

[2:30:48] <Saltmeisterr> WHY THO
[2:30:51] <$correctedsun117> @AngriestPat So its going supernova on it's own
[2:30:53] <Junkles> programmers would never design for that exception
[2:30:53] <%worldbrand> Fine work, skeleton!
[2:30:55] <Valdorick> Why? FOR SIENCE
[2:30:56] <+StoweCo> HOW TO GET HERE?
[2:30:57] <+Onivino> It was a time machine
[2:30:59] <JDebss> BIG hint
[2:31:01] <+meatxsteam> Woah space cthulu

[2:31:07] <jaylabrando> HeY gUyS lEtS bLoW uP tHe FuCkIn SuN fOr ScIeNcE
[2:31:09] <+Onivino> Who spoiled that
[2:31:12] <%Akanesasusora> has pat found the probe control module yet?
[2:31:13] <mrvidicus> Yes but that energy is being caused by a FUCKING SUPERNOVA aka BIG DEATH.
[2:31:20] <+twohitgood> you maniacs! you blew it up!!! damn you!! god damn you to hell!!
[2:31:29] <itesket> wow
[2:31:31] <CherrieVelvet> ohh.. is that why all of the stars are going supernova at the same time?
[2:31:34] <+Onivino> A COMET YOU SAY?
[2:31:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The fucking comet
[2:31:39] <+Addem_Up> @CherrieVelvet No they're just old
[2:31:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The cummie comet
[2:31:47] <+StoweCo> @Onivino he's already been
[2:31:47] <mrvidicus> So Pye went fucking crazy, made their weapon thing work, and is now blowing up all the suns in the universe.
[2:31:57] <ashuckel> a comet aproached the sun huh
[2:31:59] <+Addem_Up> @mrvidicus No
[2:31:59] <+Onivino> Yeah but this is one of the few other times they mention it
[2:32:02] <%Niney_Who> Oh boy death approaches
[2:32:04] <+nawji> Now go upstairs while you still have time
[2:32:05] <Valdorick> Blow up sun - DOESN'T WORK ANYWAY!
[2:32:07] <+Onivino> Sun Station failed
[2:32:07] <Wireframefool> We already looked at the interloper
[2:32:08] <%HeadsHeldHigh> Weeeelllll
[2:32:12] <$correctedsun117> Holy shit, that mural

[2:32:13] <haisho> Surprise! It's completely useless!
[2:32:14] <NeroInfinite> yeeep
[2:32:14] <+punit216> It didn't work
[2:32:17] <%psychodave1234> so byf just gave pat a quick run down on twitter about d2
[2:32:17] <Monkeyweed21> universe is naturally exploding
[2:32:17] <tanarath> It's not pointless, it's a superweapon
[2:32:18] <haisho> and IRRELEVANT
[2:32:18] <+EthorXL> ISN'T THAT GREAT!?
[2:32:18] <$correctedsun117> I missed that the first time
[2:32:18] <MaxXtreme23> absolutely useless
[2:32:18] <Deekman> The sun station only worked because it exploded naturally
[2:32:19] <Shiranui24> now*
[2:32:19] <Wireframefool> The sun station was meant to blow up the sun, it's a big red herring
[2:32:20] <+linSP> the sun station is important for the story
[2:32:20] <%psychodave1234> and thats p cool
[2:32:20] <JDebss> The point was to try
[2:32:21] <+wydamn> Better get back to that teleport
[2:32:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> 100%
[2:32:21] <jacob2996> If the sun blew up, the Ash Twin would've made it not happen.
[2:32:21] <%Keyd00d> what a bunch of assholes

[2:32:27] <MaxXtreme23> you should probably get out
[2:32:28] <+Onivino> Then they decided to explore the quantum moon and the comet
[2:32:29] <%ssjklyco> So were the Nomai just super villains
[2:32:30] <%mankeyfigh> RUN
[2:32:31] <%Reveresao> @angriestpat they could not figure out how to navigate dark bramble, but was able to figure out time travel and how to explode the sun
[2:32:32] <+Addem_Up> RUN PAT RUN
[2:32:33] <Youwereeatenbyalid> They didn't want to and it couldn't work anyway
[2:32:36] <%TaifuDragon> You're looking at the time loop trigger

[2:32:41] <majindusto> RUN LIKE HELL
[2:32:43] <bear_breaker20> this games great cause there is hardly a proper sequence to break

[2:33:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> here is timber
[2:33:40] <%Calek> the only thing keeping you alive is the time loop
[2:33:42] <%Kirby_Sauce> Go talk to giant's deep boy
[2:33:42] <NeroInfinite> yeeted
[2:33:42] <kane21601> @Wireframefool SHUT UP
[2:33:43] <hassanico1> THWACK
[2:33:43] <+Fortunato5678> Elena, it's very hard to explain
[2:33:44] <ShichiNoBushi> You put yourself into orbit.
[2:33:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> But stars don't die that quickly, do they? I mean, it skips half its life cycle in minutes
[2:33:45] <%arcaderabbit48> Perfect
[2:33:48] <haisho> You were fucked naturally and not by some psycho that wanted to blow up the sun. In a way, that's kind of a disappointment.
[2:33:49] <+jjhoho> now YOU are chert
[2:33:49] <jacob2996> Yeah. If it worked as intended, they would've gone back to before they fired the sun destroying ray, and then just stopped it.
[2:33:50] <ashuckel> circles?
[2:33:51] <%HeadsHeldHigh> bingo bongo
[2:33:51] <tanarath> But their tech allows you to be fucked forever until you're possibly not fucked.
[2:33:52] <majindusto> You have 22 minutes to Survive...Make your Time
[2:33:54] <Monkeyweed21> They are all fucked but you can survive
[2:33:57] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat did you not notice the statue inside the sun station?
[2:33:58] <+wydamn> Is THIS Bramble Londo?
[2:33:59] <MaxXtreme23> hey doesn't that look like the hot springs on timber hearth
[2:34:00] <+Onivino> The Nomai were alive like millions of years ago
[2:34:03] <+Addem_Up> @GarbageQueenEllie Artistic leeway for cool visual
[2:34:07] <+yeeyeyee> @Keyd00d in truth, the nomai weren't assholes. they were irresponsible but obviously their plan WOULD have worked, since you're here reliving shit over and over
[2:34:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AngriestPat go talk to guy on giant's deep
[2:34:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Onivino 200K years ago to be precise
[2:34:12] <hassanico1> @Onivino 281000 years ago
[2:34:15] <%Niney_Who> You did a apatBig 1
[2:34:18] <+Onivino> Yeah there you go
[2:34:22] <majindusto> Welp
[2:34:23] <Zalthia> So what now?
[2:34:23] <+yeeyeyee> @Keyd00d it's just unfortunate that they all died before they could see their plan succeed
[2:34:25] <SixthSun2> The resurrection statue
[2:34:26] <%Niney_Who> You avoided the entire top-floor of the sun station
[2:34:26] <%Louie_Salmon> @garbagequeenellie These are also Mario Galaxy planets with sand swapping and time travel
[2:34:27] <+jjhoho> I mean they were correct and it worked, hoes just mad
[2:34:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tanarath They invented GER
[2:34:29] <+StoweCo> IGNOR THAT COMMENT
[2:34:33] <AdmiralButtloaf> brocolli head?
[2:34:33] <+EthorXL> there was a memory statue
[2:34:34] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat THAT STATUE IS NOT ACTIVE, CHAT IS A FUCK
[2:34:34] <+Vlad3163> Except I think that the HE lab proves that they actually couldn't stop it
[2:34:37] <LodiFrostbeard> ONE GUY
[2:34:38] <mrvidicus> Nah there was a cutey statue.
[2:34:40] <MyNameIsRasus> God damn it cbat
[2:34:41] <ShichiNoBushi> There were statues just like the one in the museum.
[2:34:41] <not_twitter_rowan> chat is a fuck
[2:34:42] <%reonome> stop it chat
[2:34:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat ignore chat
[2:34:44] <foreverN2dust> chat is fuck
[2:34:44] <Monkeyweed21> there was nothing else there
[2:34:44] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat nah there was one of them nomai statues
[2:34:45] <%worldbrand> Don't worry about it
[2:34:45] <%TaifuDragon> Statue is pointless, chat is a fuck
[2:34:47] <+StoweCo> SHUT UP CHAT, MISLEADING INFO
[2:34:47] <%Niney_Who> Dunno if it was anything but you didn't check
[2:34:48] <KaseKaizer> 3
[2:34:48] <$correctedsun117> @AngriestPat Don't worry, you're done with SUn
[2:34:49] <%Niney_Who> cryShrug
[2:34:52] <%Louie_Salmon> I don't think that matters, there were just some statues in there
[2:34:54] <mrvidicus> I dunno if it's relevant or anything though. It looked cute.
[2:34:54] <$ZE_Count> use door
[2:34:55] <hassanico1> 5
[2:34:55] <+Addem_Up> Statue is minor lore but ultimately not i,portant
[2:34:55] <Blurredborderlines> There were two inactive statues
[2:34:56] <%galaxyswirl> there was a statue you just ignored, just curious if you noticed it
[2:34:56] <+Onivino> Theres only 3 statues active and one of them doesn't matter because the dude is dead. Its real fucked up to think about though
[2:34:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> It was a decorative statue
[2:34:58] <Monkeyweed21> you got everything
[2:34:58] <MyNameIsRasus> there have been like 30 "one guys"
[2:35:00] <implied_consent> @onivino The nomai are actually alive right now in the game. They're a huge species, only 1 clan was trapped in this solar system.
[2:35:03] <Endocrom> You can't get back this loop anyway
[2:35:04] <zenith0111> wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt wtfSalt
[2:35:05] <Zalthia> What now?
[2:35:06] <+SammyOVision> Statues were off. They never even turned on the project, except for the dormant ash twin files
[2:35:08] <Frostydough> I CAN'T believe chat would lie to Pat
[2:35:08] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat there's an inactive memory statue in there, it bears little relevance to the mystery
[2:35:08] <JDebss> trying to go back home for some reason?
[2:35:08] <%RubberFistFight> It's not really relevant besides being a cool thing, since there's statues all over the place.
[2:35:18] <%TaifuDragon> honk
[2:35:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Triangle!
[2:35:22] <+linSP> statues were made for a reason
[2:35:22] <EuropanLamprey> [Crazy Talk: All I need is you] activates again
[2:35:23] <iswearimjustdandy> There were like 3 statues, clearly not important
[2:35:24] <+jjhoho> yeah the nomai are big chillin, be cool to see them after a quarter million years of evolution
[2:35:24] <+StoweCo> @AngriestPat The WHAT twin project?
[2:35:25] <%HeadsHeldHigh> touch the cute cacti
[2:35:28] <mrvidicus> OH ON
[2:35:29] <LodiFrostbeard> @MyNameIsRasus chat is being extra bitchy and demanding today
[2:35:29] <MaeMae94> People would lie on the internet?! SHOCKING
[2:35:29] <mrvidicus> JANK
[2:35:31] <ashuckel> there are more total statues, like the ones in the sun station, but only 3 statues are active
[2:35:33] <%Tennochief> OH NO
[2:35:36] <%HeadsHeldHigh> AAAA
[2:35:37] <+meatxsteam> So what's it look like when the sun station gets engulfed, is it cool?

[2:36:58] <jacob2996> Pat that's specifically the White Hole Forge.
[2:36:58] <Professor_Rakor> Curious the nomai had genders, while our species seems to not.

[2:38:46] <MaxXtreme23> speaking of upside down, didn't this warp pad used to be upside down? did they change it?
[2:38:53] <JDebss> bloop
[2:38:54] <%RupanSen> apatGib
[2:38:55] <+SammyOVision> This whole tower was changed from a patch, initially the pad was on the other side of the floor, upside down, to represent that you are going in upside down. But people... didn't think that hard so it was changed to not be.
[2:38:58] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait....shouldn't it have just triggered?
[2:39:02] <+go4thekneez> you used to have to stand on the portal upside down. because it's the hanging city
[2:39:04] <bear_breaker20> its so hard to guage his overall progress lol
[2:39:05] <+Addem_Up> no that was Timber Hearth

[2:41:06] <+jjhoho> ok lads while he's gone post bepis
[2:41:06] <+Addem_Up> That ceiling sand pad thing is a dumb puzzle tbh
[2:41:10] <hassanico1> @f0rgeman unless he gives up in less than 1 hour
[2:41:12] <%Akanesasusora> what about pirate planet tho
[2:41:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Still got big shits from that chicken wrap? Brutal
[2:41:20] <mrvidicus> In case any of you missed Pat figuring out what a circle surrounded by triangles represents in the context of a space puzzle: ***
[2:41:22] <+Addem_Up> I get that it exists to avoid the BIG spoil but
[2:41:23] <jacob2996> So really, the only warp pad he hasn't gone to is the one that'll wrap this up.
[2:41:25] <+Onivino> He eat Taco Bell?
[2:41:29] <GlassBird> I wonder what the nomai childhood fatality rate was; the museum said that nomai had brittle bones, and nowhere in this solar system looks like it was safe in its prime
[2:41:33] <%ssjklyco> The Nomai were cave Johnson the whole time
[2:41:35] <mrvidicus> Wait this one. ***
[2:41:37] <bear_breaker20> Who else quantum moon bros?
[2:41:39] <hassanico1> Also can we get back to Pat not knowing what a fucking Equator is
[2:41:40] <+Addem_Up> there's exactly nothing that tells you "go while sand"
[2:41:44] <+Onivino> Well we see some dead Nomai by the angler skeleton
[2:41:49] <+Onivino> Dead Nomai kids that is
[2:41:51] <majindusto> But...EqUaToR
[2:41:53] <Shiranui24> how long has he been playing?
[2:41:57] <hassanico1> !uptime
[2:41:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @mrvidicus we're seeing asterisks, my man
[2:41:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 41m.
[2:41:58] <+Cthulos> do you fuckers not know how to say a starburst
[2:42:04] <mrvidicus> FACK.
[2:42:11] <+Addem_Up> @Cthulos what does candy have to do with this
[2:42:12] <+StoweCo> @GlassBird They mostly spent their time in other solar systems. The particular clan you see in this game were stranded in this specific solar system
[2:42:13] <mrvidicus> Ahh well. That fucking equator conversation killed me.
[2:42:15] <+Onivino> Sturburst
[2:42:16] <jacob2996> Pat came SO close to figuring out where that other tower went.
[2:42:18] <mrvidicus> I think I burned a few calories losing my mind.
[2:42:19] <Shiranui24> and has he been to to the lab on ember twin yet?
[2:42:23] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Wow Pat good that Twitch Smell-O Vision is working for sure jeez
[2:42:26] <+Addem_Up> @Shiranui24 yes
[2:42:29] <+jjhoho> there's a text log that says there will be six towers and five attunements
[2:42:31] <%Yadogari> I doubt Pat knows what a starburst is
[2:42:32] <%WackyGear> fast pee pee
[2:42:32] <+Onivino> The fastest pee in the north
[2:42:33] <hassanico1> @Shiranui24 yes
[2:42:38] <jaylabrando> shit fast
[2:42:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> at night
[2:42:42] <CherrieVelvet> night time!
[2:42:42] <mrvidicus> Did you hurt your pee-pee going that fast?
[2:42:42] <hassanico1> There are only 2 rooms he has not been in left
[2:42:43] <+Scevda> NIGHTTIME
[2:42:45] <Shiranui24> @Addem_Up did he break space time?
[2:42:45] <%psychodave1234> did big pee and poo
[2:42:46] <%BioApple> alright time to visit Ninja Station on Jagged Piece of Shit Planet
[2:42:46] <+jjhoho> it's just not stated I guess cus all the nomai got it
[2:42:46] <%RubberFistFight> SpaaaaAACCEEE!!!
[2:42:48] <Deekman> Raise the forge!
[2:42:49] <Kemmybelle> Pats back from the toilet planet.
[2:42:51] <%arcaderabbit48> Do we have to?
[2:42:52] <+Addem_Up> @Shiranui24 yes he did
[2:42:54] <zedravan> "meditate until next poop"
[2:42:55] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat tell me what a starburst is without looking at your phone
[2:42:56] <hassanico1> @Shiranui24 yes, he freakd out hard
[2:42:57] <%realm_forge> t101LETS t101DO t101THIS
[2:42:59] <GlassBird> @StoweCo yeah, and i'm wondering how often the escall clan's kids died
[2:42:59] <Shiranui24> aww i missed it
[2:43:03] <Manjove> if only you could put the forge before you teleport
[2:43:09] <%HeadsHeldHigh> don't forget to raise forge
[2:43:09] <jacob2996> Hey Pat, there's a couple more warp pads you didn't go through yet, and one you came close to solving.
[2:43:12] <+Onivino> You could also chase the probe
[2:43:12] <%WackyGear> @Onivino I like the sound of Pat the fastest pe in the west apatMenace
[2:43:16] <lionmanguy> Wait stop, I need to remember, what video/series did paige say she just pretends it's night time in space in?
[2:43:17] <Shiranui24> You're so close to done
[2:43:19] <%dekkitout> Oh nooooo apatGoblin
[2:43:19] <LodiFrostbeard> THATS NOT TRUE
[2:43:20] <%dumemoto> Man this game is neat
[2:43:20] <+jjhoho> that actually sounds pretty right tbh
[2:43:21] <+wydamn> Has Pat been to the interloper yet? I forget.
[2:43:23] <ssks123> just use all the warp pads pat
[2:43:23] <$correctedsun117> Wait, can you actually catch the probe?
[2:43:24] <%moondog_> moondog_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! look here shitlord. I did care enough...I just wanted to support your broken woman instead of you....but then she didn't stream enough. so I thought I would just settle.
[2:43:26] <+Addem_Up> @lionmanguy MAss Effect I think
[2:43:29] <+SammyOVision> Yeah he's done interloper.
[2:43:30] <+Onivino> He's the quickest pissest around
[2:43:31] <+OperatorPlease> you still need to piece together a lot of things
[2:43:33] <Endocrom> He tried to chase the probe, it's too fast
[2:43:33] <CherrieVelvet> oh yeah, the launch probe
[2:43:37] <AdmiralButtloaf> @lionmanguy star trek
[2:43:37] <+jjhoho> yeah you can catch the probe but it doesn't do a lot
[2:43:39] <+Onivino> Naw its not that fast
[2:43:44] <+Onivino> You can easily overtake
[2:43:44] <+jjhoho> no it's not
[2:43:45] <%ThatOneGameTester> apatHoldon apatWrong
[2:43:50] <+jjhoho> it doesn't accelerate
[2:43:50] <+Onivino> You just have to disable the autopilot
[2:43:51] <+linSP> the SWITCH btw
[2:43:52] <Shiranui24> @AngriestPat I actually bought (and beat) this game because of you
[2:43:54] <+jjhoho> while you do
[2:43:56] <BlacSoul> Star Trek
[2:43:57] <+Onivino> You're speed is EXPONENTIAL
[2:43:59] <+Scevda> Sun Shot should do the same
[2:44:00] <%arancet> i caught the probe, its not worth it
[2:44:04] <CherrieVelvet> you can turn off the autopilot when it tries to send you back
[2:44:06] <%HeadsHeldHigh> You're too sloooww - Knuckles
[2:44:08] <EuropanLamprey> You have to be fast when orbiting that close
[2:44:08] <SpellCatty> RAMMING SPEED
[2:44:12] <+jjhoho> yeah it doesn't do anything
[2:44:16] <%dekkitout> Is it possible for the probe to fly directly into Timber Hearth?
[2:44:16] <%Kirby_Sauce> What's the plan next guys, have him get the cheevos?
[2:44:16] <kane21601> theres also a chance it will hit a planet, since it fires in a random direction
[2:44:17] <+Onivino> Yeah but its neat
[2:44:22] <Endocrom> Maybe have to be lucky since it picks a random direction each time
[2:44:24] <JDebss> You can catch it? Wow!
[2:44:25] <+Onivino> Like the fact that they modeled the probe at all
[2:44:32] <+Onivino> And it s a big detailed model
[2:44:39] <+jjhoho> yeah I read in the subreddit somebody got hit by it and just fucking died
[2:44:43] <%Tennochief> aw no crash
[2:44:44] <+Addem_Up> @Onivino If you think that's neat, try to find the easter egg satellite
[2:44:45] <%dekkitout> Cool
[2:44:46] <%BioApple> i really thought pat was gonna get slammed by a lava moon there for a second
[2:44:54] <GlassBird> lmao @jjhoho
[2:44:55] <+jjhoho> I found the satellite really early
[2:44:56] <+Onivino> Oh man theres a satellite?
[2:45:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> @jjhoho that's great
[2:45:05] <+Scevda> water is very blue
[2:45:11] <MyNameIsRasus> i found the satellite. shits weird
[2:45:13] <jacob2996> @BioApple He doesn't make the same mistake twice... very often.
[2:45:14] <+Onivino> @Addem_Up I got all the endings but I never found the satellite neat
[2:45:17] <AdmiralButtloaf> toilet planet
[2:45:18] <+jjhoho> literally just wake up and it heads straight towards them
[2:45:21] <hassanico1> nice landing
[2:45:24] <%starotter70> apatGib
[2:45:25] <Shiranui24> is there anything on brittle hollow's moon?
[2:45:30] <+jjhoho> yeah it's for the backers I think
[2:45:32] <+Addem_Up> @Shiranui24 pain and death
[2:45:33] <hassanico1> perfect
[2:45:36] <%Louie_Salmon> @addem_up I found that thing like a couple cycles in, just happened to highlight it in space and lock on, I don't get it but it is neat
[2:45:36] <JDebss> cool, he remembered!
[2:45:39] <%Kirby_Sauce> Why does he read it each time?
[2:45:42] <+Onivino> There is one log on Hollow's Lantern
[2:45:45] <+Onivino> But its a bitch to get
[2:45:54] <+jjhoho> I didn't find it that hard tbh
[2:45:57] <Shiranui24> @Onivino how?
[2:45:59] <Manjove> fuck off, Lantern has a thing
[2:46:02] <CherrieVelvet> i rammed right into the probe and the cockpit immedietly broke off NotLikeThis
[2:46:04] <+Vlad3163> oh, did they fix that stair?
[2:46:06] <+SammyOVision> Yeah I'd love to see him do that log.
[2:46:08] <+Onivino> Just don't get hit by the lava
[2:46:09] <jacob2996> Back to Ash Twins we go?
[2:46:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> he mew
[2:46:19] <+SammyOVision> It's hard, gotta land in a volcano at the end of the cycle when the lava is low.

[2:47:04] <+Onivino> He Cumbo, he do the Stumbo
[2:47:05] <JDebss> he good boi
[2:47:06] <aiutare47> Real cumbo hours who up
[2:47:06] <+MidnightBurst12> the age of CUMBO is now
[2:47:08] <KangarooCyborg> Cumbo Baggins
[2:47:13] <%Kirby_Sauce> Sounds grosser
[2:47:15] <mrvidicus> Cumbo Bumbo.
[2:47:18] <%HeadsHeldHigh> I'm still laughing at Pat's "Don't call me a cumbo...:("
[2:47:21] <SaltyGuyMan> Cumboivin
[2:47:24] <%castarts> Cumbo III : Second Impact
[2:47:28] <mrvidicus> Cumbo want Gumbo. You Dumbo bring Cumbo Gumbo.
[2:47:30] <%walternatorz> is it possible to lengthen cumbo to columbo?
[2:47:30] <o0SilentKnight_> Cumbo Gang
[2:47:31] <%starotter70> Get a load of this Cumbo
[2:47:35] <+jjhoho> in universe it's "you woke up 22 mins before supernova"
[2:47:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> @SaltyGuyMan brilliant
[2:47:39] <bear_breaker20> remember to pee after you cumbo
[2:47:45] <GlassBird> @ssjklyco i think it goes back 22 minutes, regardless of activation time
[2:47:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Cumboivin is strong
[2:47:49] <JDebss> so much bullshit
[2:47:49] <+Scevda> Its all their fault
[2:47:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bingo Bongo, Cumbo Combo
[2:47:51] <+EthorXL> then the interloper murdered them
[2:47:52] <$correctedsun117> All of it to find that answer
[2:47:55] <%Scarnehu> Scarnehu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! thanks for the years of entertainment. now go defeat space you stumby goof
[2:47:58] <%arancet> sunny go boom, except it didnt, until now
[2:47:59] <%HeadsHeldHigh> They built everything then got fucking recked by the ghost cums
[2:47:59] <+EthorXL> fuck the interloper
[2:47:59] <+SammyOVision> And they all died like a bitch to ghost farts
[2:48:00] <+linSP> you know the comet killed everyone
[2:48:02] <+Onivino> Basically
[2:48:03] <Valdorick> The real message is of the game is - Science is a fuck, become a luddite!
[2:48:04] <not_twitter_rowan> Yup
[2:48:04] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Wasn't Clum Babies a Wooldor Sockbat thing
[2:48:04] <%starotter70> They saw the Cum
[2:48:05] <%BioApple> they went and saw the cum
[2:48:05] <%bakiinthedemon> And they died like bitches
[2:48:05] <$ZE_Count> it was all built to track the eye of the universe
[2:48:06] <%castarts> the WHAT
[2:48:07] <$correctedsun117> Comet = Chernobyl
[2:48:07] <beefomkers> Hey Cumbo how's space @angriestpat
[2:48:08] <%dekkitout> That is some Seele tier boondogglery
[2:48:08] <%MachoMadnesss94> check your log see if you missed anything @AngriestPat
[2:48:10] <Wan6Saber> they got junkersREKT ?
[2:48:10] <Shastafield> and then they died
[2:48:12] <+Onivino> The comet FUCKED them up
[2:48:13] <%Louie_Salmon> The interloper is just a bastard
[2:48:15] <EuropanLamprey> RAMMING SPEED
[2:48:15] <SpaceGuntank> i thought this was all to see the eye of the universe?
[2:48:15] <ashuckel> what was in the comet pat?
[2:48:16] <%HeadsHeldHigh> Wooooooo
[2:48:16] <mrvidicus> Sick X-Wing manuevers there, Pat.
[2:48:17] <%crimsonharvest> fuckin barnstorming up in
[2:48:17] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat they didn't find the eye though, that's recent
[2:48:19] <majindusto> IT WAS ALL THEIR DOING
[2:48:19] <+wydamn> Pat is basically correct
[2:48:20] <%arancet> well, sun exploder was a confirm fail BEFORE the comet
[2:48:21] <+meatxsteam> Holy shit
[2:48:23] <+jjhoho> ghost matter is basically just super uranium
[2:48:23] <+Addem_Up> @AngriestPat Life is futile and weak and you're going to die without knowing why
[2:48:24] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I don't know this game, but I do like the idea of "they build the sun exploding station, they solved the moon."
[2:48:26] <hassanico1> CRASH
[2:48:27] <%HeadsHeldHigh> "Feel"?
[2:48:31] <+Addem_Up> That's the moral of the story
[2:48:31] <bear_breaker20> the comet how?
[2:48:31] <hellfirejefe> @AngriestPat their plan would have totally worked if they didn't get fucked by the interloper
[2:48:33] <hassanico1> RAMMING SPEED
[2:48:40] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat you definitely did
[2:48:41] <%BioApple> Interloper did nothing wrong, it just wanted to save the sun
[2:48:42] <kane21601> you kinda did
[2:48:43] <Shiranui24> the wha
[2:48:44] <%Reveresao> you will soon
[2:48:44] <+go4thekneez> :)
[2:48:45] <+jjhoho> and think of how long it's been in the solar system
[2:48:46] <+Addem_Up> You did.
[2:48:50] <+guterman500> You did
[2:48:51] <%Reveresao> you already found a third person
[2:48:52] <+Onivino> Its surprising your PC's alien race didn't die from the comet, I think water negates the ghost matter
[2:48:52] <+SammyOVision> The third person is the DATA from the ash twin project
[2:48:53] <OldOnyx> still haven't found the 3rd birthday
[2:48:54] <beefomkers> You already did
[2:48:54] <%bakiinthedemon> Third person?
[2:48:57] <+wydamn> Pat the third mask isn't for a person, it's for the oribtal probe canon.
[2:48:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat You found cheit last time
[2:48:59] <Manjove> you will find them in the Ash Twin
[2:48:59] <%MachoMadnesss94> Jesus
[2:48:59] <%TaifuDragon> Solanum
[2:48:59] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat Think about it, what else is going back in time besides you and gabbro
[2:49:01] <+Onivino> You probably did but you didn't recognize him
[2:49:03] <%Reveresao> the probe
[2:49:03] <$correctedsun117> @AngriestPat THe entire project itself
[2:49:03] <Kowtowner> LUL
[2:49:04] <laguerrilha> you did
[2:49:05] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat THE THIRD PERSON WAS BEHiND YOU ALL ALONG
[2:49:07] <kane21601> probe data
[2:49:07] <f0rgeman> don;t tell him
[2:49:10] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Not who, WHAT
[2:49:10] <Monkeyweed21> the third is the probe
[2:49:12] <alrobot2014> you found feldspar, gabbro, and chert?
[2:49:13] <+jjhoho> don't worry about it
[2:49:13] <%dekkitout> I thought he found all three
[2:49:14] <+Addem_Up> Who else did you meet?
[2:49:17] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Quantum Moon bro.
[2:49:17] <+Onivino> Theres a log on Giant's Deep
[2:49:17] <jacob2996> ...Huh?
[2:49:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> Shut up
[2:49:18] <+BloodyBurney> spanish inquisition
[2:49:20] <%HeadsHeldHigh> Wow chat is actually split on this
[2:49:21] <+JokerNewby> Giants deep canon
[2:49:21] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> good
[2:49:23] <%bakiinthedemon> Banjo man on brittle hollow?
[2:49:23] <%Reveresao> the probe is the third one that's hooked up to the system that sends it back into the past
[2:49:26] <WeebFever> It was you, the player
[2:49:27] <+Onivino> A log on Giant's Deep tells you who the third person is
[2:49:27] <Manjove> the Probe data
[2:49:28] <Kowtowner> shh everyone
[2:49:28] <GlassBird> chat is dumb
[2:49:29] <+xBolts4Lifex> nothing you guys is making sense
[2:49:29] <Monkeyweed21> the third statue is for the probe
[2:49:30] <+MellowMute> what third person?
[2:49:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Felspar is in brittle hollow, Gabbro is on Giants deep, Cheit is on Ember Twin
[2:49:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> bibbilldy blorpyblorpy
[2:49:32] <$Mothman742> @AngriestPat its ur mum lol gottem
[2:49:33] <%BioApple> "nothing you guys is making sense" -angriestpat, 2019
[2:49:33] <derekwst3> its pikachu
[2:49:34] <Naoyin> why does the probe launch in different directions
[2:49:37] <mrvidicus> Does your character know how many loops he's been through? Or does he just wake with the knowledge? What if he's done millions of loops, and failed each time. That's gotta fuck with you real bad.
[2:49:38] <jacob2996> Are you talking about the banjo man on Brittle Hollow Pat?
[2:49:39] <MyNameIsRasus> it's the data from the probe
[2:49:39] <+Addem_Up> There's one person who would know how the statue works
[2:49:39] <+RD_nx> aren't you the third, then it's the guy on the ember twin and the guy on giants deep?
[2:49:40] <%dekkitout> Were we the third person all along?
[2:49:43] <%korth367> 3rd person was the friends we made along the way
[2:49:44] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat each of the masks is data going back in time. What data goes back in time that was the point of this whole loop?
[2:49:44] <%ssjklyco> It was Earth all along
[2:49:45] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Probe is third
[2:49:47] <%Louie_Salmon> @naoyin It's built to
[2:49:47] <%HeadsHeldHigh> it's obviously peepeepoopoo
[2:49:49] <+SammyOVision> Remember the probe is being shot randomly each cycle/timeline? the project is taking that data and sending it back in time for reference.
[2:49:51] <alrobot2014> oh
[2:49:52] <derekwst3> summon exodia
[2:49:52] <%MachoMadnesss94> one is BABA
[2:49:53] <$correctedsun117> Gabbro
[2:49:54] <%CalebHatesGames> CalebHatesGames subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Love you, Pat. Stay cool.
[2:49:54] <Endocrom> The probe has groundhog day powers too
[2:49:54] <+Onivino> The third person lives a horrible life
[2:49:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> OHHHHHH
[2:49:55] <%bakiinthedemon> Ohhhhh
[2:50:01] <kane21601> they only fired the probe once because it would fire in a different direction each loop, adn thus they would eventually find it, as long as the data was sent back
[2:50:01] <+Addem_Up> They know how the statue works.
[2:50:01] <+EthorXL> the third one was in the probe tracker
[2:50:02] <+jjhoho> @mrvidicus you've been conscious of the loop for as long as you have been playing the game
[2:50:02] <Monkeyweed21> the third is the probe
[2:50:02] <ssks123> Baba is third
[2:50:04] <+wydamn> Remember how they shot the probe canon thousands of times, but only used the canon once?
[2:50:04] <+StoweCo> Solanum
[2:50:05] <+Grayhammatter> Baba?
[2:50:06] <%Kirby_Sauce> Go talk to him again btw
[2:50:06] <%worldbrand> The third person was the friends we made along the way
[2:50:06] <+MellowMute> Use your signal scope?
[2:50:06] <Naoyin> @Louie_Salmon meant to direct it at pat specifically lol
[2:50:07] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat not who, what
[2:50:07] <%galaxyswirl> shhhhhhhh
[2:50:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Guy on the Quantum Moon?
[2:50:09] <shiny_prinny> baba
[2:50:09] <%Reveresao> @angriestpat the statue is synced with the probe looks for the eye and since the data back into the past
[2:50:10] <beefomkers> Baba
[2:50:10] <chikensandwich> the probe
[2:50:10] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Probe
[2:50:11] <+Addem_Up> The third isn't the probe.
[2:50:11] <+go4thekneez> the probe beacon on giants deep
[2:50:12] <derekwst3> you meet him
[2:50:12] <+linSP> how do you think they have so much prob data lcoations and only ONE launch?
[2:50:13] <bear_breaker20> my wife*
[2:50:13] <Shiranui24> The third mask is paired to the project itself for the data
[2:50:13] <lionmanguy> The half dead nomai on the quantum moon?
[2:50:14] <$correctedsun117> The probe has to send info back 22 minutes, remember
[2:50:14] <Valdorick> You'll find third, shut the fuck up chat.
[2:50:14] <+JokerNewby> probe that launches differently everytime
[2:50:15] <+Onivino> The third is not the probe
[2:50:16] <TenorSounds> One of the statues is I. The third probe that has the coordinates
[2:50:16] <+ShadowForceX75> didn't you say they discovered a way to send data back in time, fr
[2:50:18] <AdmiralButtloaf> Emet Selch is the 3rd person
[2:50:18] <%Mr_Pylon> don't worry you'll find out
[2:50:19] <%arancet> i think its your moon friend
[2:50:19] <%Louie_Salmon> @naoyin Ah, right
[2:50:20] <WeebFever> ???
[2:50:22] <jacob2996> Pat you met the third one. The guy that's both dead and alive on the Quantum Moon.
[2:50:22] <Junkles> Mukuro Ikusaba. The seventh planet hidden somewhere in this solar system.
[2:50:22] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Addem_Up the what the fuck is it?
[2:50:24] <derekwst3> and the other is
[2:50:25] <+go4thekneez> that's how the data is different each loop
[2:50:26] <+StoweCo> The third is Solanum on Quantum Moon
[2:50:29] <Monkeyweed21> cuz it fires in a different direction each loop
[2:50:30] <Manjove> you learned that last time
[2:50:31] <beefomkers> Just keep exploring Pat
[2:50:32] <+Onivino> The third is not Solanum
[2:50:33] <TenorSounds> It keeps sending the probe data back in time
[2:50:35] <%dekkitout> What about the other guy on the fish planet?
[2:50:35] <kane21601> @StoweCo nope
[2:50:36] <%MachoMadnesss94> hi
[2:50:36] <JDebss> no the probe is seperate
[2:50:38] <+jjhoho> solanum isn't aware
[2:50:38] <MyNameIsRasus> not solanum
[2:50:39] <%Estuko> Plant: HeyGuys
[2:50:42] <+Onivino> The probe just works that way
[2:50:42] <mrvidicus> @jjhoho Oh, that's not so horrific then. You just have to feel your entire being gte wiped out in a super nova every 22 minutes.
[2:50:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Elena spoiled it
[2:50:43] <%Louie_Salmon> Well, that's how that can actually keep track of which one finds the eye, specifically
[2:50:43] <+StoweCo> I see how I'm wrong
[2:50:48] <+Hinasil> The 3rd person was I, DIO
[2:50:49] <Kowtowner> well spoilers, its sends its data back to itself after the reset
[2:50:49] <+go4thekneez> solanum isnt in the loop
[2:50:51] <itesket> Is that it?
[2:50:52] <+wydamn> @jacob2996 I don't think Solanum is paired with a statue
[2:50:57] <+Onivino> She isn't
[2:50:57] <+jjhoho> yeah but like, you technically never have to if u just got gus
[2:51:00] <+jjhoho> gud*
[2:51:01] <+Addem_Up> I thought it was Sola, fuck me then
[2:51:02] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Hi moon bye moon
[2:51:03] <%Keyd00d> the third person is me, come find me if you can
[2:51:04] <+Jaysky> But BABA is LOOP
[2:51:07] <+jjhoho> Really it's your own fault
[2:51:09] <Endocrom> Remember you are looking for the triangle one
[2:51:10] <jacob2996> Okay then I got nothing. I finished the game and I don't even know.
[2:51:14] <+RD_nx> badass.
[2:51:16] <hassanico1> UH
[2:51:18] <%Louie_Salmon> Yeah, solanium is just a Schrodinger's cat situation
[2:51:20] <+Addem_Up> I guess it is the probe
[2:51:23] <$KnivesEve> if your on the quantum moon and you blink does that mean your no longer on it?
[2:51:26] <+Onivino> The third person has left their treasure but you'll have to find it in ONE PIECE
[2:51:26] <JDebss> Not really sure who it is either actually
[2:51:27] <hassanico1> phew
[2:51:28] <jacob2996> Oh the probe!
[2:51:29] <$correctedsun117> EVERYBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP
[2:51:30] <%HeadsHeldHigh> Solanum is just cute, that's all
[2:51:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> yeah WHY DID THEY
[2:51:31] <Valdorick> Because their science is a fuck - answer to everything.
[2:51:31] <%arancet> why indeed
[2:51:32] <ssks123> HMMMMM
[2:51:33] <+Onivino> GEE I WONDER WHY

[2:52:09] <garbageheaphound> dont forget black hole forge
[2:52:11] <%bakiinthedemon> Big think. 1000 IQ gamer
[2:52:13] <+LastHazzerd> das a gerd querstion mergaman
[2:52:17] <%dekkitout> "But y tho" is all I'm feelin' this stream
[2:52:19] <itesket> The nomai built it as a social experiment to put on youtube
[2:52:20] <Manjove> if only there was something on the Ash Twin we are locked offf from
[2:52:20] <ammobasket> Brittle hollow tho
[2:52:21] <+Grayhammatter> just to prank pat, obviously
[2:52:22] <+go4thekneez> hmm you haven't seen the relay for it
[2:52:24] <zenith0111> Pat does a think
[2:52:24] <poweredscoot> Just a prank bro
[2:52:24] <Shiranui24> aww
[2:52:25] <%MachoMadnesss94> thank you
[2:52:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat you really should
[2:52:31] <f0rgeman> goddammit
[2:52:36] <+derrigible> Take the Jetpack Jesus!
[2:52:36] <mrvidicus> I feel like he was about to figure it out there too.
[2:52:37] <+wydamn> @ashuckel he's mostly figured them out, just not the one for the twins
[2:52:39] <+jjhoho> we're railroading him
[2:52:41] <kane21601> that is hearth
[2:52:41] <Endocrom> Not that one
[2:52:42] <%starotter70> Clutch
[2:52:43] <%psychodave1234> big stumbo
[2:52:43] <+Onivino> He has infinite tries, he could have just figured it out right now
[2:52:44] <%Akanesasusora> that one's for timber hearth
[2:52:45] <+jjhoho> we're bad dms
[2:52:45] <MyNameIsRasus> he really should hit the forge first
[2:52:49] <jacob2996> Ember Twin, twin tower warp pads... Hmmm.
[2:52:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Almost landed on a cactus.
[2:52:54] <kane21601> might want o2 though
[2:52:54] <ashuckel> that's not what i meant
[2:52:58] <zenith0111> Cumbo do a think
[2:53:00] <+meatxsteam> You need to make an emote for everytime you go euuuuuuhhhhh
[2:53:01] <+axellogic> Stumbo akimbo
[2:53:03] <WeebFever> Is that how canadians say hearth?
[2:53:04] <+Addem_Up> Get air umbo
[2:53:05] <+SammyOVision> Pat that's oxygen though
[2:53:07] <MyNameIsRasus> the towers are ordered in distance of the sun i think
[2:53:08] <+Grayhammatter> do a big think pat
[2:53:10] <Manjove> do think yeah
[2:53:10] <hassanico1> >herth
[2:53:14] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat hey if you haven't figured it out, the brittle hollow warp station is shaped like the black hole forge
[2:53:14] <Endocrom> Yes that one
[2:53:14] <%crimsonharvest> it's really convenient that none of the planets in this solar system have orbital inclination or axial tilt
[2:53:20] <jacob2996> This is the one.
[2:53:25] <+go4thekneez> this is it
[2:53:28] <+jjhoho> yeah I was gonna say
[2:53:30] <+Onivino> Its a tiny sun
[2:53:31] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @crimsonharvest you mean like our solar system?
[2:53:33] <haisho> that's ninja planet, because kunais are triangles
[2:53:34] <+Onivino> And tiny planets
[2:53:41] <mrvidicus> OH no not again!
[2:53:41] <%StripesUltimateEdition> sleep
[2:53:44] <$correctedsun117> BIG OOF
[2:53:45] <+jjhoho> there are a lot of conceits so that this game works but I'm okay with all of them
[2:53:46] <%psychodave1234> OH BOI
[2:53:47] <ashuckel> BIG BUG
[2:53:48] <+Addem_Up> @crimsonharvest you can literally jump into a black hole and be fine in this universe
[2:53:52] <hassanico1> Can you sideways choke on Sand?
[2:53:54] <+gutlesscoward> ninja planet! yoooooo
[2:53:54] <mrvidicus> Pull out your shovel and dig before the sand kills you and you lose all your stuff!
[2:53:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @crimsonharvest its actually the norm. Our solar system is weird to have one lopsided
[2:53:56] <%crimsonharvest> @Youwereeatenbyalid yeah out here in Sol we don't line up perfectly
[2:54:03] <+jjhoho> this is just video gamey enough
[2:54:05] <+edited156> annnnnnd jump
[2:54:06] <%bakiinthedemon> We in there!
[2:54:07] <%BioApple> okay now jump
[2:54:10] <laguerrilha> clap
[2:54:10] <+Addem_Up> Don't jump
[2:54:10] <Manjove> that teleport freaks me out everytime
[2:54:11] <GlassBird> yeaaah
[2:54:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @crimsonharvest I mean we're pretty close though
[2:54:12] <+StoweCo> Jump!
[2:54:14] <ashuckel> jump
[2:54:15] <%Louie_Salmon> And now jump for joy
[2:54:19] <ammobasket> Wheeee!

[2:54:25] <%Kashi_Nin> Hello!
[2:54:26] <+Onivino> Somebody get the hinker
[2:54:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @crimsonharvest neptune is the only weird one
[2:54:27] <+go4thekneez> STOP
[2:54:29] <+Onivino> Honker
[2:54:30] <kane21601> nope
[2:54:30] <zedravan> F
[2:54:33] <+Addem_Up> NO
[2:54:33] <%Reveresao> the forge
[2:54:35] <%Yadogari> PAT PLEASE
[2:54:36] <%bakiinthedemon> Pat look relative up
[2:54:37] <NeroInfinite> our lopsided orbit is why we can live on earth comfortably.
[2:54:37] <+StoweCo> Jump pat!
[2:54:38] <f0rgeman> phew
[2:54:39] <%starotter70> whew
[2:54:40] <Shiranui24> just the exit over there
[2:54:41] <+Onivino> HE'S DOING IT CHAT
[2:54:41] <mrvidicus> "Black Hole Forge" Didn't know Woolie makes a cameo in this game.
[2:54:44] <%crimsonharvest> @Youwereeatenbyalid earth is inclined, uranus is inclined 90 degrees, netptune is fucked up
[2:54:45] <Infinityod> whew
[2:54:47] <+edited156> Hey Pat what's that thing Kris Kross will make you do?
[2:54:50] <Valdorick> Blackhole forge, won't you come, and manufacture cores. Blackhole Forge, won't you come.
[2:54:52] <+StoweCo> heheheh <3
[2:54:52] <%galaxyswirl> he knows
[2:54:54] <%Tennochief> CRISS CROSS

[2:55:17] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @crimsonharvest oh yeah the axial tilts.
[2:55:20] <+Onivino> If you just remember what each of those stones looks like for each planet
[2:55:21] <ScreamLord> DAYTAH!\
[2:55:25] <%RubberFistFight> Go ask Tasha Yar, she got a piece of Data that one time, remember? :P
[2:55:28] <%Reveresao> thank God he's he's finally here wubbyPray

[2:55:40] <%Tennochief> ash twins
[2:55:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> sun
[2:55:47] <zoldknight> I really don't get the tower resemblance for brittlle hollow
[2:55:47] <+StoweCo> LOOK, TWINS, HMMM, TWINSSS
[2:55:48] <mrvidicus> The shuriken station.
[2:55:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> but where's the equator 🤔
[2:55:52] <hntronium> there's the ninja planet
[2:55:53] <+jjhoho> I completely forgot about this
[2:55:55] <42nfl19> so how close is Pat to the end? Can he possible finish it tonight?
[2:56:00] <GlassBird> dont you mean the dark bramble

[2:56:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> (gasp) the TWINS!
[2:56:04] <%Reveresao> @angriestpat the image on the floor was the original image that was inside of the high energy lab before the patch
[2:56:06] <itesket> Look at this smug statue
[2:56:09] <+SammyOVision> The symbol for the sun station looks like the pendulum in the middle of the sun.
[2:56:12] <ashuckel> are you?
[2:56:14] <+Addem_Up> @42nfl19 if he gets big smarts
[2:56:15] <+jjhoho> those statues are little bitches
[2:56:16] <+Onivino> ALL THE CORES ARE GONE PAT
[2:56:16] <%MachoMadnesss94> is this black hole station?

[2:56:39] <JDebss> Your princess is in another castle
[2:56:45] <+Jaysky> Baba is End but Pat is Gun
[2:56:46] <+Onivino> Technically you're supposed to get here before the High Energy Lab
[2:56:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> YEYEYEYE
[2:56:48] <%aimlesshealer> Poke sounds uncomfortably close to Pokey
[2:56:50] <%MachoMadnesss94> apatBig THINKING!
[2:56:52] <ShimmerFairy> sun station = planet
[2:57:00] <Deekman> 2nd last location. You can finish this to ight

[2:57:09] <+StoweCo> ASHUU TWINUUU
[2:57:10] <%Louie_Salmon> Hmm

[2:57:16] <$correctedsun117> Bramble has no station. It wasn't important to the project
[2:57:18] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Those gears are grinding
[2:57:19] <hassanico1> BUT BABA
[2:57:19] <%MachoMadnesss94> apatBig THINKING!!
[2:57:21] <+jjhoho> poked with u238

[2:57:25] <%crimsonharvest> bramble isnt a native planet
[2:57:26] <jacob2996> Pat think, why is there two towers?
[2:57:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> what does the OTHER one say
[2:57:26] <%HeadsHeldHigh> alright they literally told you soooo

[2:57:35] <+SammyOVision> Maybe look at the other text?
[2:57:40] <%Akanesasusora> man, i haven't been back here since before the patch, and i kind of can't believe how drastically they redesigned it
[2:57:41] <laguerrilha> vineBrainyot
[2:57:50] <mrvidicus> Baba!?
[2:57:55] <+jjhoho> this what I BEEN saying
[2:58:04] <%dekkitout> Wat?!

[2:58:42] <ShimmerFairy> Don't forget the data hunk on the floor.
[2:58:43] <+Addem_Up> Where it's pointing and where it goes aren't necessarily the same, @AngriestPat
[2:58:44] <+wydamn> So, basically what I'm getting from this is that the Nomai are just fucking all the time.
[2:58:44] <$ZE_Count> slab
[2:58:45] <%crimsonharvest> so they said six towers, but you dont necessarily have to line up perfectly? was that it? i dont get this
[2:58:46] <+jjhoho> Clary getting that hot goat Dick
[2:58:47] <%Keyd00d> ASMR
[2:58:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Get the tablet clumbo
[2:58:48] <zoldknight> Oh, that's where the dialog was changed
[2:58:48] <%Louie_Salmon> Don't forget the slab
[2:58:49] <Valdorick> Can't help but notice the twin ash tower is TWO towers.

[2:59:05] <jacob2996> Remember the slab Pat.
[2:59:07] <kane21601> return the slab pat
[2:59:12] <+jpivot> twin planets, twin towers. HMMMMM
[2:59:12] <+SammyOVision> This was the text changed in the patch
[2:59:12] <mrvidicus> The Nomai are goat people, huh? Not that there's... anything wrong with that, Raiden...
[2:59:20] <+Saltima> strange how you've been teleported UNDER brittle hollow's crust
[2:59:20] <%starotter70> What's your Offer!?
[2:59:21] <+jjhoho> this is good text change

[3:14:25] <hassanico1> What the heck does Gabro have to say?
[3:14:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat if you're going to do that, might as well check the lantern as well.

[3:18:19] <NeroInfinite> That was all he had to say
[3:18:21] <$correctedsun117> TIME IS COLLAPSING. Yeah, but my music tho
[3:18:22] <%Reveresao> @angriestpat remember you need the launch code for the eye
[3:18:23] <GlassBird> i love gabbro, he doesn't give a fuck
[3:18:24] <%realm_forge> Inverse the subatomic particle field so that a warp core overload creates a cascading subspace pulse wave that should invert the temporal anomaly
[3:18:30] <Naoyin> im so excited
[3:18:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Reveresao he got it already
[3:18:30] <%dekkitout> Gabbro is the definition of boolin
[3:18:31] <zoldknight> What a quote
[3:18:34] <LodiFrostbeard> he gives no shit's, he's done all this before
[3:18:36] <+go4thekneez> @reveresao he got it
[3:18:37] <+Walopoh> That's a mood]
[3:18:39] <+Onivino> Hollow's Lantern
[3:18:39] <itesket> Maybe dont
[3:18:40] <mrvidicus> I am legitimately so worried that this game doesn't have a happy ending.
[3:18:41] <zenith0111> That dude on the hammock is my spirit animal
[3:18:42] <+MellowMute> Restart the loop and give yourself more itme
[3:18:48] <%Louie_Salmon> Or at least, end this solar system for good
[3:18:50] <chambatron> Ill east your brain
[3:18:53] <%Reveresao> I know guys I wanted to make sure he had it on hand when he got to it
[3:18:53] <NutolasCage> Grabbo is a pretty cool guy. eh plays fluet and doesn't afraid of anything
[3:18:54] <jacob2996> You took a photo, right?
[3:18:59] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah, reset the loop, i think you're out of time now.
[3:18:59] <zoldknight> Oh. THat's smart
[3:18:59] <jacob2996> In the last part?
[3:18:59] <+Onivino> It doesn't matter
[3:19:00] <+Grayhammatter> the egg palace
[3:19:00] <%mankeyfigh> @mrvidicus Define happy
[3:19:02] <+Vlad3163> Doesnt need to, he needs to wait for the tower to uncover anyway
[3:19:03] <+Onivino> The game just gives you code
[3:19:03] <EuropanLamprey> Let's put that up on Pat quotes "Alright, let's get out of here and end the universe"
[3:19:04] <Shiranui24> It actually tells you automatically if you know the code
[3:19:04] <+go4thekneez> the tower isnt even uncovered yet he has plenty of time
[3:19:06] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat with the core inserted, the coordinates show up in the bottom left when you need to input them
[3:19:10] <+wydamn> Pat, you just did a good thing that will make your life a lot easier
[3:19:12] <%Kirby_Sauce> The game reminds you
[3:19:13] <majindusto> RAMMING SPEED
[3:19:18] <+Walopoh> Bill Marketing pushes the end universe button
[3:19:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @mrvidicus there is no happy ending to the heat death of everything FeelsBadMan
[3:19:19] <+Onivino> Its like how you always have the launch codes at the start of the game
[3:19:24] <+jjhoho> it shows up like the launch codes dw
[3:19:24] <mrvidicus> @mankeyfigh Something remains.
[3:19:24] <Monkeyweed21> ash twin pat
[3:19:27] <zoldknight> Yeah
[3:19:38] <+jjhoho> yeah I didn't even realize you could Mark that
[3:19:41] <%Tennochief> The Aphex Twin Project
[3:19:49] <+Onivino> That makes it way easier
[3:19:52] <%MachoMadnesss94> @AngriestPat look at the map view of the log you may see somewhere you haven't been. I missed something that way, but you may have already gotten it
[3:19:53] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @AngriestPat just make sure you land the ship so it won't get sucked away
[3:19:55] <%mankeyfigh> @mrvidicus sure yeah
[3:19:56] <+armor_kuma> Why did you even GO to giants deep then jist wait on the ash twin
[3:19:59] <%realm_forge> Fuck it just fall into the sun again
[3:19:59] <JDebss> Anyone else here manage to land on the sun station?
[3:20:00] <+go4thekneez> looks good
[3:20:01] <LodiFrostbeard> always overshoots
[3:20:01] <+Grayhammatter> overshot again
[3:20:02] <$correctedsun117> Wow, you actually have a lot more time than I thought
[3:20:09] <jacob2996> Autopilot is a fuck.
[3:20:09] <itesket> Tick tock
[3:20:15] <Wireframefool> You have plenty of time
[3:20:16] <%starotter70> Watch him fly into the sun with the core
[3:20:16] <zoldknight> Yeah, but clench is garunteed otherwise
[3:20:16] <MyNameIsRasus> tick
[3:20:17] <+go4thekneez> @armor_kuma new dialogue with the other guy in the loop
[3:20:20] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat good spot to land the ship is one of the two super tall gravity tower things.
[3:20:20] <hassanico1> this autopilot, ugh
[3:20:20] <Wireframefool> It's just stressful
[3:20:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat looks like you got there in time. Make sure not to park the ship where the sand is
[3:20:21] <%galaxyswirl> lets hope the ship doesnt get carried away
[3:20:22] <+jjhoho> if u wanna camp it's about 4:45 to be safe with some time to spare
[3:20:23] <GlassBird> i honestly didnt realize you could mark the vessel, so i went to the nomai grave and shot the probe during my final run instead
[3:20:23] <%Estuko> Why am I suddenly remembering the movie "Gorillas in the mist" NotLikeThis now I'm sad
[3:20:24] <%bakiinthedemon> Should have just enough time really
[3:20:24] <MyNameIsRasus> tock
[3:20:25] <+Onivino> You can't do it until like the last 10 minutes
[3:20:25] <Manjove> you have at leas 11 minutes
[3:20:27] <%starotter70> Like poetry
[3:20:27] <laguerrilha> want to train with the angler fish?

[3:59:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride1000 LET THERE BE LIGHT! Kind of a bittersweet ending. What an experience though.
[3:59:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat When you saw yourself it was the universe shrinking into a tiny tiny dot so small you occupied two spaces
[3:59:32] <%GabeSweetMan> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:59:32] <%DedlokPM> Congratulations! *Clap*
[3:59:32] <derekwst3> dont skip credits
[3:59:32] <+armor_kuma> And then no one played it D:
[3:59:32] <zoldknight> She isn't there
[3:59:32] <+yeeyeyee> she's just not here
[3:59:32] <%realm_forge> time to make and kill the dinosaurs followed by Jesus
[3:59:33] <Manjove> She isnt there
[3:59:33] <+nawji> Solanum just isn't there for the ending
[3:59:34] <%ssjklyco> The game ends at the beginning
[3:59:34] <Monkeyweed21> she isnt there
[3:59:34] <kane21601> not there
[3:59:35] <%Deadpal> SHe's not there
[3:59:35] <%Calek> a slightly different ending
[3:59:36] <KaseKaizer> she's not there
[3:59:36] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat she's not there
[3:59:36] <Hydrapissed> stinger
[3:59:36] <CherrieVelvet> big stumbo made the big bang
[3:59:37] <+armor_kuma> She isn't there
[3:59:37] <%starotter70> Same end but without her
[3:59:37] <+jjhoho> same just not as good a song
[3:59:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> Isn't there
[3:59:39] <+linSP> no solanum :(
[3:59:40] <Deekman> no keyboard
[3:59:40] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Not often you see a game end with you creating the universe
[3:59:41] <$ZE_Count> You got better ending
[3:59:41] <+SammyOVision> it's okay to cry
[3:59:41] <@lewdskeletor13> I wasn’t sure at first, but that’s easily GOTY so far
[3:59:42] <Wireframefool> You got the best ending
[3:59:43] <tanarath> Would say it's 7/10, Pat?
[3:59:43] <+TehBeerBaron> I actually didn't meet her, and about the same
[3:59:44] <+jpivot> :^)
[3:59:45] <+go4thekneez> no keytarist
[3:59:46] <jacob2996> No Solanum, and you get the normal ending.
[3:59:46] <SleepyMaribo> when you touch the orb you essentially kill the universe
[3:59:49] <+BloodyBurney> oh god im actually crying
[3:59:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat no solanum, no sweet piano
[3:59:50] <+wydamn> Solanum just isn't there if you don't meet them
[3:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:52] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat she's missing from the final song. You basically get the GOOD ending. You just got the GOLDEN ending.
[3:59:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> See you, Space Cowboy
[3:59:52] <zoldknight> Yeah, and I think post credits changes
[3:59:52] <%Louie_Salmon> And of course, no piano in the song
[3:59:53] <Hydrapissed> ima cry brb
[3:59:53] <jaylabrando> what happens if you go straight to the end
[3:59:57] <titsmaloy> There's a campfire that pops up at the end that wouldn't otherwise, implying that you fucked up the new universe
[3:59:58] <laguerrilha> This is the best space themed game in existence
[3:59:59] <Naoyin> post credits changes a tiny bit
[4:00:00] <+pedrothecruel> I can't believe it stuck the landing
[4:00:01] <$ZE_Count> Hell of a indie Game.
[4:00:02] <%Mr_Pylon> song ain't as good and the final screen changes
[4:00:05] <solar_pinnacle> wtf its been 4 hours?!?
[4:00:06] <ShichiNoBushi> What if you beeline from the immediate start to the end?
[4:00:06] <Deekman> Goty easily
[4:00:06] <$Bane_Kaikyo> BIG C L A P
[4:00:07] <+nawji> We just saw Heat Death > Big Crunch > Big Bang condensed into a game
[4:00:08] <%Agami23> this game is the opposite of "dont let it set in" its "embrace inevitability"
[4:00:08] <+Tarkara> @AngriestPat Its theorised that if the amount of matter in the universe is just right then this will actually happen, everytime the universe dies itll collapse and explode out again
[4:00:08] <chambatron> I just can't believe this game at all. So fresh and new OMG
[4:00:09] <+Onivino> Now get the 3 other endings
[4:00:10] <jacob2996> And because you shot the probe, you got the PERFECT ending!
[4:00:11] <%HeadsHeldHigh> i've seen this ending multiple times, but I get teary everytime
[4:00:11] <Deekman> LOVED THIS
[4:00:11] <%mankeyfigh> @jaylabrando you get bad end
[4:00:11] <%croxeye> @SleepyMaribo the universe that you inhabited is already dead, you're making a new one
[4:00:14] <$ZE_Count> Top tier indie game.
[4:00:15] <zoldknight> Most optimistic ending about the end of the universe confirmed?
[4:00:16] <jaylabrando> Ah
[4:00:16] <chikensandwich> GOTY
[4:00:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now everybody clap!
[4:00:18] <derekwst3> so that's how darksouls started...….interesting
[4:00:18] <+yeeyeyee> @jaylabrando the game won't let you without seeing the coordinates in giant's deep
[4:00:18] <KangarooCyborg> Yeah, get the dog ending
[4:00:19] <mr_slaide> I can fap to this!
[4:00:19] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat btw, once you get the warp core, you can actually coward out and run from the supernova or hide on the quantum moon for bad ends
[4:00:21] <%Tennochief> no THIS was an adventure
[4:00:22] <darcfowler1995> this game deserves like so many fucking Awards
[4:00:23] <bear_breaker20> now go read Rene Guenon*
[4:00:23] <zenith0111> @tarkara BibleThump
[4:00:24] <+Grayhammatter> man, that was a nice ride, even if anglerfish are fucking bastards
[4:00:24] <Deekman> This music is the best
[4:00:25] <+Despera__> It's amazing how well it ends
[4:00:25] <maxwell_adams> do another run where you slam dunk the warp core into the sun
[4:00:27] <JDebss> Fucking big claps
[4:00:27] <%Agami23> i have never hated epic games more than right now.
[4:00:29] <$ZE_Count> I clapped
[4:00:29] <%waltzqueen> This feels like a game about accepting Death
[4:00:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> It's that one asimov story and it's the best.
[4:00:31] <MaxXtreme23> this ending was truly made in heaven
[4:00:31] <mrvidicus> "A perfect story doesn't exi-"
[4:00:31] <SleepyMaribo> @croxeye im talking about the bad ending
[4:00:35] <Manjove> great game
[4:00:35] <+go4thekneez> @onivino he got the space time one
[4:00:36] <KaseKaizer> too bad it's not on Steam yet FeelsBadMan
[4:00:38] <%Sirculbs> so what happens if you die with the twins turned off
[4:00:38] <jaylabrando> That shit was amazing
[4:00:38] <MyNameIsRasus> there's two endings you've missed i think
[4:00:39] <+Onivino> Oh cool
[4:00:41] <JDebss> Is this a perfect game?
[4:00:43] <@lewdskeletor13> I hope this new universe doesn’t have anglerfish
[4:00:47] <zoldknight> Ya die
[4:00:47] <+nawji> YOU ARE DEAD
[4:00:47] <Manjove> bad end
[4:00:48] <%RubberFistFight> @maxwell_adams fuck that, do a run where you remove the core from the ship and throw yourself into the eye with it.
[4:00:49] <KaseKaizer> credits
[4:00:49] <ssks123> reset progress
[4:00:49] <Shiranui24> bad end
[4:00:49] <zenith0111> I'VE FINALLY ACCEPTED MY MORTALITY BibleThump
[4:00:50] <+yeeyeyee> game over
[4:00:51] <Meekest> You die
[4:00:51] <%Deadpal> bad end
[4:00:51] <%croxeye> @SleepyMaribo ah i see, i never got it myself
[4:00:51] <kane21601> ya ded
[4:00:51] <+Onivino> You die
[4:00:51] <Naoyin> u just die and reload a save
[4:00:52] <%galaxyswirl> you due
[4:00:52] <haisho> then you die
[4:00:52] <$correctedsun117> @AngriestPat Credits
[4:00:53] <+Grayhammatter> big dead
[4:00:53] <+jpivot> it says YOU ARE DEAD
[4:00:53] <VigilantShield> guess you just die
[4:00:54] <%starotter70> Game over
[4:00:54] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat it sends you back to main menu and you reload to your last wakeup
[4:00:54] <%Tennochief> can't wait for this game to come out outside of EPic
[4:00:55] <Valdorick> Start screen and you reload the last leap
[4:00:57] <+Fortunato5678> Same as before you touch the statue
[4:00:57] <+BurncoatRapscallion> You die for real
[4:00:57] <LodiFrostbeard> YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE
[4:00:58] <+Who_lio42> you get YOU ARE DEAD like the start of the game
[4:00:58] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> People die when they are dead
[4:00:59] <+linSP> game over like the one you got when you died before pairing with the statue LUL
[4:00:59] <ShichiNoBushi> Game Over credits?
[4:01:00] <JDebss> find out
[4:01:01] <+Despera__> It's like the first you died screen you got
[4:01:01] <+jjhoho> same as when you broke the universe but without the joke part
[4:01:01] <%wujak> same as when you drowned at the start of the game
[4:01:01] <%Louie_Salmon> It gracefully keeps your save
[4:01:03] <+jjhoho> no fuck no
[4:01:03] <+derrigible> you should find out
[4:01:04] <MyNameIsRasus> a failure of the game designer
[4:01:04] <CherrieVelvet> "YOU ARE DEAD" and then credits
[4:01:04] <majindusto> IT SET IN
[4:01:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat it deletes your save
[4:01:04] <zoldknight> Nah
[4:01:05] <$ZE_Count> Its dont reset
[4:01:05] <%TaifuDragon> It does NOT reset your progress
[4:01:05] <%mankeyfigh> DED
[4:01:06] <%Kirby_Sauce> No
[4:01:06] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat without the core the ash twin project doesn't work, breaking the loop.
[4:01:06] <+taco_flambe> You just die
[4:01:07] <+gutlesscoward> then you're dead, bad end. but bad ends are like the joke ending you got, you can just start from your save
[4:01:07] <gloppie> No it doesnt
[4:01:07] <+wydamn> you just get gameover, it doesn't delete your save
[4:01:08] <+jjhoho> that would be horrible
[4:01:08] <+LastHazzerd> no
[4:01:08] <fatalDestiny> Like when you dies of falling damage before the statue
[4:01:08] <%HeadsHeldHigh> LUL you die in real life...
[4:01:10] <Deekman> It doesnt
[4:01:10] <+go4thekneez> big wrong
[4:01:12] <+armor_kuma> NO it just says YOU DIED
[4:01:12] <derekwst3> but i thought yugioh started the world
[4:01:12] <%ComboDogeX> Claps All around for these guys huh
[4:01:13] <%dekkitout> Let's dodge the end of the universe tajC
[4:01:13] <zoldknight> Same as the breaking time thing
[4:01:16] <%arancet> kicks you to title
[4:01:19] <+LastHazzerd> it's like when ya broke reality
[4:01:19] <zoldknight> It would
[4:01:20] <%Cthulos> Damn green baby angler fish
[4:01:20] <$correctedsun117> Hiro comes to your house and punches you in the face
[4:01:21] <%worldbrand> I admire games with the balls to reset your progress
[4:01:22] <%starotter70> I know right?
[4:01:23] <KangarooCyborg> It uninstalls steam
[4:01:23] <poweredscoot> deletes hard drive
[4:01:23] <zenith0111> RIGHT?
[4:01:24] <%dave323dave> that was probably on their design doc tho
[4:01:25] <+Tarkara> GOTY?
[4:01:26] <+go4thekneez> lol
[4:01:26] <bear_breaker20> Thats how it should be*
[4:01:27] <shinichizio> Games that delete your save for excess stupidity are bold
[4:01:28] <Hydrapissed> unistalls lol
[4:01:28] <$ZE_Count> That would piss people super off
[4:01:28] <JDebss> @AngriestPat YES
[4:01:29] <Wan6Saber> badass I say :tf:
[4:01:30] <MasterDecoder> Remember Chat, it's 10 seconds between us and him
[4:01:30] <tanarath> It SHOULD delete your save.
[4:01:30] <%Keyd00d> deletes the game from your hard drive and blocks it forever
[4:01:31] <derekwst3> yugioh started the bigbang
[4:01:32] <+jjhoho> oh for sure
[4:01:32] <%BioApple> deleting your save wouldn't even mean anything aside from making you do the tutorial again
[4:01:33] <%Deadpal> Yeah, but this is a more relaxing game than that
[4:01:33] <Caidezes> It's not a Yoko Taro game, Pat.
[4:01:34] <+Onivino> You can orbit just around the super nova too and see it happen but not get the ending
[4:01:34] <+OperatorPlease> well because of how the game works that wouldnt set you BACK
[4:01:35] <%Kirby_Sauce> Deletes the game from your console
[4:01:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> It totally should. I'd be mad, but I'd get it.
[4:01:35] <+armor_kuma> That'd make this game a 10
[4:01:36] <Monkeyweed21> you would already know what to do
[4:01:38] <%Verd_254> you never really lose progress in this game tho. just computer data
[4:01:39] <%RubberFistFight> Guys did Pat figure out how to break the universe in the high energy lab? The trick with the probe?
[4:01:39] <+Jaysky> Like Nier?
[4:01:39] <%wujak> it wouldnt really matter. you can still go straight there and try again
[4:01:40] <+BurncoatRapscallion> That would be so good
[4:01:41] <haisho> it doesn't really change anything you already personally know
[4:01:43] <tanarath> But fuck them, you can do all of that in like 1 or 2 run again.
[4:01:43] <%StripesUltimateEdition> :,)
[4:01:43] <+EthorXL> your save of what?
[4:01:43] <%Estuko> IT calls the CIA to come assassinate you for fucking up LUL
[4:01:47] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Just like with ........ From Nier Gestalt
[4:01:47] <+Who_lio42> like thatd be fucked but it wouldnt matter much tbh?
[4:01:48] <+PolarBearPat> what if you went straight to ash twin and the vessel?
[4:01:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wait this is FUCKING UNITY!
[4:01:49] <KangarooCyborg> It emails your credit card information to the players who didn't fuck it up
[4:01:50] <hassanico1> @RubberFistFight he did and he freaked out
[4:01:50] <%bakiinthedemon> Would've been. not like you couldn't beat it right then anyways
[4:01:51] <+wydamn> I mean, technically you can beat the game on the first loop anyway.
[4:01:51] <bear_breaker20> best UNITY game *
[4:01:51] <$ZE_Count> I liekd it too pat
[4:01:51] <%Keyd00d> it sends goons to your house
[4:01:51] <%MachoMadnesss94> Cheer100 it was fun watching you stumbo through this fantastic game. I never would have played it myself if I hadn't watched your first stream so thanks for that.
[4:01:52] <GASHUNK0> is it still GOTY?
[4:01:52] <%Louie_Salmon> @bioapple Well, and losing all the QOL info in the ship
[4:01:53] <+jjhoho> ludonarrative synchronicity meet practicality there
[4:01:55] <%HeadsHeldHigh> Still GOTY?
[4:01:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh man can you IMAGINE speedruns?!
[4:01:55] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat it would have been fucked up, but I would have respected it.
[4:01:55] <laguerrilha> Didnt know i could cry for this. that ending BibleThump
[4:01:57] <%arcaderabbit48> Outer Wilds is a fantastic game that I could not bounce off of harder. But I'm glad everyone else had fun, especially PAt
[4:01:57] <TheyCallMeVawn> Outer Wilds is okay
[4:01:59] <+Onivino> Theres also an ending involving the Quantum Moon
[4:02:00] <+TheNeonGraveyard> if you die with the warp core you die in real life
[4:02:00] <+gutlesscoward> @AngriestPat well the problem with that is that progression doesn't matter. you didn't get a single necessary key item that you'd lose by resetting progress
[4:02:01] <hassanico1> @AngriestPat BTW this took 7 years to make
[4:02:04] <%arancet> still say GOTY?
[4:02:04] <$ZE_Count> I wanna see some speedruns now
[4:02:05] <alrobot2014> @RubberFistFight yes he did, and it was freaky
[4:02:05] <jaylabrando> 9/10 too many anglerfish
[4:02:06] <+Saltima> I really like the final frame of these credits
[4:02:06] <Finaldragoon> shame it's locked behind the Epic Game Store
[4:02:07] <foreverN2dust> it's been a crazy ride, thanks for taking us along Pat
[4:02:09] <%ssjklyco> 6 Hearthians and one Female Nomai. Time to repopulate
[4:02:09] <%RubberFistFight> @hassanico1 hahaha oh man i missed it, i;ll have to check out the vod
[4:02:09] <JDebss> @laguerrilha same
[4:02:11] <CherrieVelvet> breaking the fabric of space time should break your save
[4:02:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @GabeSweetMan speedruns aren't that good apparently.
[4:02:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Thanks for showing us this awesome game
[4:02:16] <tanarath> If you know the quantum rules, you can meet solanum in one, then go to the Ash core in the second.
[4:02:16] <%starotter70> This was nice
[4:02:17] <+armor_kuma> @AngriestPat You can break the universe in the high energy lab too and blow it up
[4:02:17] <zoldknight> God I love the soundtrack
[4:02:17] <+jjhoho> speedruns aren't THAT crazy, 12-17 minutes depending on category
[4:02:18] <%Estuko> @ssjklyco uwu
[4:02:18] <+Onivino> Pat didn't get the Quantum Moon ending right?

[4:02:19] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[4:02:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The real outer wilds was the band we made along the way.

[4:02:20] <%Mornaka> cryCry
[4:02:21] <+Who_lio42> I love how all the "tools" you get to solve shit are just knowledge
[4:02:22] <zenith0111> I'M NOT CRYING
[4:02:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Finaldragoon it is a bloody shame
[4:02:24] <$ZE_Count> I gotta find this music for phone
[4:02:24] <Blurredborderlines> this is how you make a game in Unity
[4:02:26] <%Tennochief> Epic does not deserve to have this masterpiece
[4:02:26] <+jjhoho> yes he did
[4:02:26] <%RupanSen> now respec in FTH for the second run
[4:02:26] <Explodincatz> GOOD
[4:02:27] <zenith0111> YOU'RE CRYING
[4:02:28] <MaxXtreme23> this music is so fantastic
[4:02:28] <%HeadsHeldHigh> wellll
[4:02:29] <$correctedsun117> @AngriestPat Reminder that you could have done this whole thing on your first life
[4:02:29] <JDebss> right?
[4:02:29] <+zetaplus> Eh I feel pretty indifferent about this game
[4:02:30] <mrvidicus> It was a great journey, everyone. Games like this remind me how powerful art can be, and what it can do for you as an indivual.
[4:02:30] <hassanico1> speedruns miss the point of the game
[4:02:32] <+BurncoatRapscallion> There's Shipless speedruns
[4:02:32] <%Louie_Salmon> Well, it's fun to do the movement
[4:02:33] <+nawji> A game that can't be speedrunned is a good thing, speedrunners are crazy people
[4:02:34] <Monkeyweed21> You have to speedrun to beat it
[4:02:34] <+RD_nx> and thanks to Epic Games for funding this title!!! ... oh wait
[4:02:35] <MyNameIsRasus> there are no ship runs tho
[4:02:35] <tanarath> It really is about the journey.
[4:02:35] <chikensandwich> not at all
[4:02:36] <+Despera__> @AngriestPat I think a 100% speedrun would be cool
[4:02:37] <Shastafield> a lot of speedruns are
[4:02:37] <Deekman> Speed runs if this game are like 10 minutes lop
[4:02:38] <poweredscoot> speedruns are pointless.
[4:02:38] <$Audega> @AngriestPat Still better than RE2?
[4:02:38] <%Piemen99> WE ALL ARE CRYING TOGETHER
[4:02:39] <Hydrapissed> @AngriestPat yo peach gana play?
[4:02:39] <derekwst3> you need to wake paige up and tell her its bed time
[4:02:40] <titsmaloy> Music giving me that end hallway of Undertale vibes
[4:02:41] <CoffeeTableBlack> a great indie game reminds me of thomas was alone
[4:02:43] <+jpivot> god bless andrew prahlow for the absolutely SICK tunes
[4:02:43] <Assaultpanda> @ZE_Count IT'S ON SPOTIFY
[4:02:44] <zoldknight> I mean speedrun the full log maybe?\
[4:02:44] <+wydamn> I cried too. Get a lot of weird feels from this ending
[4:02:44] <+jjhoho> shipless is fucking funny
[4:02:45] <+linSP> @AngriestPat this is gone home but space
[4:02:45] <+LastHazzerd> I'm 100% crying
[4:02:46] <laguerrilha> The universe ending and you meting your friends for the last time is so sad
[4:02:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BurncoatRapscallion I do not believe it
[4:02:47] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @ZetaPulse then I am sorry for you
[4:02:50] <+go4thekneez> one of the least replayable games ever
[4:02:50] <zedravan> shipless
[4:02:53] <rytisone> now onto Pat's top 10 games of 2016
[4:02:53] <GlassBird> I like the ship movement a lot, so this is the only game ive ever considered speedrunning
[4:02:55] <%worldbrand> shipless sounds hysterical
[4:02:56] <haisho> I mean getting to the ending is TECHNICALLY a speedrun
[4:02:59] <%Kirby_Sauce> No
[4:02:59] <%Estuko> beat's another CERTAIN GAME'S center of the universe ending LUL
[4:03:00] <itesket> @AngriestPat Will you pick up fish detective game again or is that just dropped?
[4:03:01] <Acidshocker> Wish I caught this from the beginning...
[4:03:02] <LodiFrostbeard> tops yeah
[4:03:02] <chambatron> I'm sad this game has an end tbh fam
[4:03:03] <+guterman500> Speedrun world record is 16 minutes I think
[4:03:05] <+luftraumm1> you could just do it right after all this
[4:03:07] <Deekman> This is one of those games I want to wipe my memory of
[4:03:08] <$HyperionXV> There's also a 100% notes found speedrun
[4:03:10] <%MachoMadnesss94> so the eye of the universe is just a apatBig reset button
[4:03:10] <%Kirby_Sauce> Unskippable tutorial
[4:03:11] <+jjhoho> 16:52 sleepless
[4:03:11] <%Calek> and all endings speedrun would have to be a thing
[4:03:11] <JDebss> I cried so hard
[4:03:13] <%HeadsHeldHigh> god this OST though
[4:03:13] <%Louie_Salmon> Well yeah, the goal is for it to be shorter, that's why they go fast
[4:03:14] <zenith0111> Makes everything seem so small doesn't it?
[4:03:16] <+Castawayplague> 8min.
[4:03:17] <f0rgeman> one loop run: ***
[4:03:19] <ZazzyDoesStuff> current WR is 16:30ish
[4:03:21] <derekwst3> so are you doing a borderlands playthrough now?
[4:03:22] <$correctedsun117> Poor kickstarters got fucked that this went to Epic instead of Steam tho
[4:03:23] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat Notes found and full band could be routes tho
[4:03:26] <%mankeyfigh> @angriestpat WHAT ABOUt a 100% speedrun
[4:03:26] <%Estuko> @Deekman never experience it for first time again
[4:03:27] <+Despera__> 100% ship would be a good run
[4:03:28] <%Mr_Pylon> the nomai are so interesting and terrifying as hell.plan to blow up the sun over and over until we find the eye, then don't blow up the sun that time.
[4:03:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Nihilism: The Video Game
[4:03:31] <MichaelDood> So what exactly is The Eye?
[4:03:31] <+armor_kuma> @GlassBird I mean thats just any space game really, you'd probably just like elite dangerous or star citizen too
[4:03:32] <+floralkami> how fast can you speedrun the heat death of the universe.
[4:03:32] <darcfowler1995> speedruns have always been pointless but I guess I get why people like them
[4:03:32] <tanarath> You could probably do quantum at the start, get to the ash twin, then do the thing maybe.
[4:03:34] <+go4thekneez> @kirby_sauce all you have to do is walk to the observatory takes like 1 minute
[4:03:36] <Deekman> @estuko the true pain
[4:03:37] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Shipless % is 23:36 minutes
[4:03:37] <%ssjklyco> Nomai's Sky
[4:03:38] <jacob2996> You gotta run to the observatory, run back, get in your ship, do all that junk and run through the eye stuff.
[4:03:38] <+jjhoho> there's also normal, shipless, and solanum% iirc
[4:03:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Become as Pucci
[4:03:42] <+yeeyeyee> The nomai's plan failed, but it led to the universe being reborn, and in the end the last remaining member of their species got to see it happen
[4:03:43] <%wujak> ive seen someone do it without the ship and only the jetpack
[4:03:46] <haisho> 100% speedrun would be painful
[4:03:47] <tanarath> 'What is the eye?' Memory.
[4:03:52] <%heyitsbrian> THESIS ADVISORS??
[4:03:52] <Futurecity10> Shame you didnt explore the interloper fully
[4:03:53] <Nina96> @what if it said 99% complete and u missed one line of text?
[4:03:53] <rytisone> Epic
[4:03:54] <%logoth_> Next time get all 5 library cards
[4:03:55] <@lewdskeletor13> TIM SCHAFER?
[4:03:57] <+Onivino> 100% All Endings Speed Run
[4:04:02] <ShichiNoBushi> "Everyone at EPIC"
[4:04:04] <+jjhoho> yup this game was for a doctorate I guess
[4:04:05] <bear_breaker20> so that eye of the universe tho*
[4:04:06] <MyNameIsRasus> but shipless tho
[4:04:06] <%Tennochief> @GeneralSCPatton Pucci could only dream of achieving this level of perfection
[4:04:06] <zoldknight> The eye is azatoth
[4:04:07] <zenith0111> Speedruns would be dumb
[4:04:08] <%Mr_Pylon> check out the no ship run
[4:04:09] <%Keyd00d> the homies
[4:04:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Did I see Tim Schafer in that list
[4:04:10] <%Verd_254> the homies
[4:04:12] <$ZE_Count> Uep this was good game
[4:04:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Tim Schafer is an anagram for Mr Shitface
[4:04:12] <mrvidicus> Wouldn't you need to meet all the people to get the true ending though? So more than one loop.
[4:04:13] <+jjhoho> I gotta find out what
[4:04:13] <+yeeyeyee> Any game that thanks you for playing it is a good game
[4:04:13] <nobody12349> Post credits scene where you're killed by a kid in a baseball uniform
[4:04:14] <+go4thekneez> ship less lmao
[4:04:15] <%Keyd00d> THANK YOU FOR PLAYING
[4:04:15] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @lewdskeletor13 holy shit that man can still be involved in good games?
[4:04:15] <JDebss> I guess the eye is the origin of all things and the location of the big bang
[4:04:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> This was a great series
[4:04:16] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Defy the Head Death of the Universe by igniting another Big Bang
[4:04:20] <+wydamn> Big Red Button is also in here somewhere. AKA the company behind Sonic Boom
[4:04:21] <%Estuko> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[4:04:22] <%Verd_254> that's a feel good
[4:04:23] <+armor_kuma> @yeeyeyee I mean it didnt really fail, they shot out like 90000 probes and found the eye, they just died
[4:04:24] <%Louie_Salmon> 100% plus all endings would be kinda fun, going everywhere and doing everything
[4:04:24] <+luftraumm1> life games that do that
[4:04:24] <%Deadpal> It's classy
[4:04:24] <%worldbrand> I love it

[4:05:52] <haisho> how is the ending now that you saw the probe?
[4:05:53] <+Tarkara> THE TITLE SCREEN IS THE ENDING
[4:05:53] <%dave323dave> that probe has seen some shit!
[4:05:54] <kane21601> if you sit on this title screen you can watch all the stars blink out
[4:05:56] <VigilantShield> man that's a trip

[4:06:33] <$correctedsun117> GAME OF THE BILLION YEARS
[4:06:33] <tanarath> Did you ever think that the main menu was or is now the Eye?
[4:06:34] <derekwst3> im proud of you son
[4:06:35] <foreverN2dust> Best space game, bar none.
[4:06:35] <+Onivino> YOU WERE SPOILED ALL ALONG HAHA
[4:06:36] <%tebari> Forest
[4:06:36] <Gerik1233> Shit, twitch gave out for me right after the credits!
[4:06:37] <darcfowler1995> I hope our universe gets to end in such a cool way
[4:06:38] <JDebss> @AngriestPat Is this a perfect game?
[4:06:39] <Deekman> I want a sequel to this so bad
[4:06:40] <MyNameIsRasus> hey look it's that forest
[4:06:41] <Meekest> THE FOREST IS THE END OF THE GAME
[4:06:42] <jacob2996> Oh shit this forest is the quantum realm place!
[4:06:43] <%RupanSen> I hope in Outer Wilds 2 you get to fight aliens with big robots
[4:06:44] <+BloodyBurney> GOTY
[4:06:45] <+MellowMute> There goes another billion lives
[4:06:45] <%Tennochief> this game doesn

[4:06:46] <@lewdskeletor13> This game is amazing
[4:06:48] <+FyteSoulstone> the main menu is the end of the game... GG
[4:06:52] <haisho> Title screen was a spoiler the whole time!
[4:06:52] <NeroInfinite> oh wowow
[4:06:52] <%realm_forge> Why couldn’t synthwave make it to the end of existence
[4:06:53] <CatmanIX> shit, did i miss the stream?

[4:06:53] <zoldknight> See you in 7 years for the sequel
[4:06:53] <%Keyd00d> soak it all in
[4:06:53] <+linSP> TITLE SCREEN WAS EYE ALL ALONG
[4:06:54] <+jjhoho> I mean the eye had the title screen Forest yeah
[4:06:54] <tanarath> Most aren't going to put it together.
[4:06:56] <%Tennochief> this game doesn't need a sequel
[4:06:59] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh my fucking god it's the GOD DAMN EYE
[4:07:00] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I feel like a sequel to this defeats the purpose
[4:07:01] <Futurecity10> @jacob2996 Dyson spheres have suns, not black holes
[4:07:01] <%Tennochief> this game is perfect as it is
[4:07:02] <Monkeyweed21> you're looking at the ending this whole time
[4:07:02] <Gallhint> this game is absolute fucking KINO
[4:07:05] <Deekman> So is it still your goty pat?
[4:07:05] <%starotter70> Time to bask in the afterglow
[4:07:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Well, that's enough existentialism for one day, I think.
[4:07:08] <%RubberFistFight> @JDebss no because you can only really play it once. I mean, you can re-play it, but you'll only ever get that first experience once, never again.
[4:07:10] <Zombrocom> Well that was a thing
[4:07:11] <Endocrom> Now make Paige play it!
[4:07:13] <majindusto> IT WAS HERE ALL ALONG
[4:07:13] <SpaceGuntank> so pat how ya feelin'
[4:07:13] <MrGarettLefebvre> Top 5 of 2019?
[4:07:16] <%croxeye> @CatmanIX if you haven't played the game yourself GO PLAY IT instead of spoiling it for yourself
[4:07:16] <zoldknight> You would never know
[4:07:17] <nobody12349> That's dope
[4:07:19] <Jetsfantasy> That end screen is available on wallpaper engine to everyone btw
[4:07:19] <+RD_nx> like DMCV
[4:07:21] <Basch71> thats peak kino
[4:07:21] <haisho> @Endocrom You madman. No.
[4:07:21] <zenith0111> That's how you make a good nostalgia
[4:07:23] <+luftraumm1> conscience is just the universe investigating itself huh
[4:07:23] <%Keyd00d> is it still GOTY for you Pat
[4:07:23] <rytisone> just like in Nier Automata
[4:07:23] <%starotter70> Same
[4:07:24] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Make Paige play it when it comes to steam
[4:07:26] <%Deadpal> Goodnight pat!
[4:07:26] <mr_slaide> He is le tired.
[4:07:26] <ssks123> how long do you think it would take paige to beat it
[4:07:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Endocrom Paige is scared of space
[4:07:26] <tanarath> Pat, you missed some lore in the Ash Twin Project Core.
[4:07:27] <bear_breaker20> well time to jerk off i guess...
[4:07:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> in conclusion, 10/10 game of the year
[4:07:28] <%crimsonharvest> you did a big good job

[4:07:34] <majindusto> Tired Pat
[4:07:34] <Deekman> What a ride
[4:07:36] <+Fortunato5678> Creating a new universe really takes it out of you
[4:07:37] <tanarath> There were updated stones that you didn't look at.
[4:07:37] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat not surprised, you gave birth to a new universe.
[4:07:37] <%Louie_Salmon> You'd never even think, because it's just a cute forest on a little planet
[4:07:38] <%realm_forge> YES! Make Paige play it!
[4:07:38] <rathomk> Now you can do two things @angriestpat , you could’ve done what you did and quit, and you can start a new game and make EVERYTHING futile
[4:07:39] <%Keyd00d> yeyeye more ff7

[4:08:06] <ssks123> you should see what the alpha looked like
[4:08:06] <+Onivino> This game proves its just nighttime and then you make it daytime
[4:08:07] <Endocrom> Just have her fly around for a bit at the begining of a stream
[4:08:07] <SleepyMaribo> you gotta make Woolie finish this game

[4:08:38] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Paige would LITERALLY DIE
[4:08:38] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat maybe do a Sinking City stream this week for the extra slot? I found that game pretty interesting too
