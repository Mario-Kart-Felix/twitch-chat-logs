[0:10:36] <%cvp5127> boohoo
[0:10:38] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:10:38] <peachy996> I just played this DLC to Doom Eternal, I have mixed feelings on it
[0:10:46] <%toolofparanoia> Those people are freaks
[0:10:47] <bufflb> they're right
[0:10:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Much needed
[0:10:47] <+Irridium> COWARDS
[0:10:48] <+silentblast93> but it wasnt hard
[0:10:48] <Pookiedaexzile> It's less Dick Splitting, which is not how doom works
[0:10:49] <+OmegaWeltall> ....Good
[0:10:49] <%drabberfaun535> cowards
[0:10:52] <StarmanJay> Difficulty? Forget that mess. I'm upset about how it shit all over the story.
[0:10:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm playing Part 1, it's barely nerfed
[0:10:56] <user_naim> Play on Nightmare Pat!
[0:10:58] <peachy996> It sucks
[0:10:58] <@commanderclaw> But if they can't beat a bullshit hard game, how can we know their penises are super huge?
[0:11:00] <bufflb> it was already easy
[0:11:03] <+Cobaltor_252> na it was warranted
[0:11:03] <%Tman451> Made it less ballbusting, but is still difficult for sure
[0:11:03] <%JoshManVGH> oh no... the game is still fun right?
[0:11:05] <+tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to peachy996! They have given 425 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:11:06] <%peachy996> I don't like it
[0:11:07] <ghoostyberry> those cowards fucking back down
[0:11:07] <armchairmaster_> The difficulty isn't the issue, it's the fact that story is fucking ASS.
[0:11:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> People are hoes mad that its easier and short despite its also 3 levesl
[0:11:10] <%BoxNavy> so everyone could have just played on easy
[0:11:11] <%valriot> Fuck that, i beat all these on Nightmare, TAG1 was really fucked towards the end. They already said they want DLC to be DLC, not Master Levels
[0:11:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @barrakuta371 congrats man i had the some thing ealrier this last year...now im back into the unemployment jobhunt again
[0:11:12] <+silentblast93> i played it on ultra nightmare
[0:11:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt I'm playing Part 1, it's not nerfed that much
[0:11:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'm buying a house within the month, and have a femboi vtuber moving in with me this week. So that's life I guess.
[0:11:24] <%drabberfaun535> doom needs a hell or hell mode
[0:11:26] <Zebroneath> Part 1 is harder than part 2, but it's still pretty tough
[0:11:26] <+SilverDevilfish> But Pat, I have to pretend I play the hard game so people think I have the big peepee Kappa
[0:11:28] <+Cobaltor_252> who tf cares about the story it's doom
[0:11:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm playing it on normal
[0:11:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> its doom
[0:11:34] <%peachy996> Not really
[0:11:36] <kingmemelord97> if i by a game and its dlc i wanna beat it
[0:11:37] <%BoxNavy> thats fine who care
[0:11:40] <%valriot> Its Doom plot
[0:11:40] <%toolofparanoia> Ancient Gods part 1 was CBT mode ovekill
[0:11:43] <%JoshManVGH> I mean, Eternal wasn't exactly grand writing itself.
[0:11:46] <Tracazoid> It's Doom, something something plot in porn
[0:11:47] <Pookiedaexzile> CIRCLES
[0:11:47] <SaltyAzteca> I mean its Doom.
[0:11:48] <%valriot> IDK what people expected
[0:11:50] <%peachy996> It starts off from Final Sin and goes from there
[0:11:52] <%YakumoYomi> @GeneralSCPatton Femboi, you say...?
[0:11:54] <%coward_man> doom plot: demons suck
[0:11:59] <Sprawler14> Does the Doomguy shoot the de-mon?
[0:11:59] <raikagelord1> So is playing part 1 and 2?
[0:11:59] <bufflb> doomguy resurrects daisy
[0:12:00] <%BoxNavy> uhhhh....
[0:12:02] <Sprawler14> That's all it needs to be
[0:12:04] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:12:04] <%valriot> Its a game about a game who just shoots Mars
[0:12:05] <%peachy996> Story sucks so who cares

[0:12:36] <%JoshManVGH> Cool.
[0:12:37] <+Mrrccava> how could it not matter? I'm not like super into Doom lore lol but unless the next doom is ANOTHER reboot I don't get it lol
[0:12:38] <StarmanJay> Doom 2016 and Eternal base gave us a story to care about. And then the expansions told us not to care about the story.
[0:12:39] <+Cobaltor_252> the story is just an excuse to shoot more and bigger demons
[0:12:43] <bufflb> new menu music
[0:12:47] <%peachy996> @armchairmaster_ Yeah well the DLC turned it to crap so yay
[0:12:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Doom has a Story?

[0:21:52] <%BoxNavy> NO I MEANT THE SKILL
[0:21:53] <+CookieCutter007> but poison is cool
[0:21:55] <%BoxNavy> NOT RAW GS
[0:21:56] <TheBeanBox> you just need the great sword to be bigger, the biggest

[0:22:10] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> As a hammer main, yeah elements are for suckers just hit harder
[0:22:15] <+BettyMwwaahh> There arent any good GS in Iceborne that didnt have element or status
[0:22:15] <halfmasks> that greatsword is RAW
[0:22:20] <%valriot> But Pat i thought you said Woolie was fdumb for not adapting to the game and using amrour skills
[0:22:23] <%PanicSwytch> Just go Gunlance Blast element
[0:22:23] <%Axellogic> Negative affinty weapons are so useless in icebourne it sucks
[0:22:25] <Theoyveyman> IT'S  R A W
[0:22:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Putting elements on a great sword is like putting ketchup on a steak
[0:22:34] <Theoyveyman> LEAVE THE STOVE

[0:52:16] <+EdenOfLove> patpat you have a bfg ammo coming up so dont miss a chance to fire it
[0:52:27] <user_naim> @ipsenscastle what do you mean? They’re just stronger, but give more resources

[0:53:12] <%peachy996> But the Imp Rush is still fun
[0:53:13] <Ipsenscastle> I'm thinking of something else I guess
[0:53:15] <user_naim> @ipsenscastle that’s the spirits from DLC one
[0:53:22] <Theoyveyman> Oh yeah, they STILL haven't put invasions into the game
[0:53:31] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt So far, do you think they balanced this better than the previous dlc?
[0:53:35] <Ipsenscastle> @user_naim oh thank you, i was mixing things up
[0:53:35] <spawnzie> @Ipsenscastle that's spirit posessed demons, empowered demons are just stronger

[0:58:24] <%Jaxnos> the funniest bit is that your ability to talk seems to decrease while you're NOT fighting
[0:58:25] <%Paperware> Doom: Become Unga Bunga
[0:58:29] <Theoyveyman> Oh hi DS2
[0:58:29] <%YakumoYomi> @ABakedDemon I'd honestly just want Eternal's new toys in 2016. I don't care for all the platforming in Eternal
[0:58:35] <xbb1024> I think Pat's brain is at max capacity
[0:58:36] <Ipsenscastle> big brain am winning again
[0:58:38] <ScreamLord> Big Brain Drain

[0:58:58] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Remember chaingun is big beef too
[0:58:58] <Darkfire346> Doom: Eekum the Bokum
[0:59:02] <scht3v3> The fuck?
[0:59:03] <huskarl_zap> The fact that they nerfed it so much says they think changing it drastically was a mistake
[0:59:07] <user_naim> too slow?
[0:59:07] <T_Sasquatch> nu-doom*
[0:59:16] <brachydios777> I love the movement in Eternal, going back to 2016’s movement is pretty different
[0:59:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Khan Makyr? More like Dum-dum Makyr AMIRITE
[0:59:24] <Pookiedaexzile> You will not be safe
[0:59:29] <%logoth_> The door was just painted on

[0:59:45] <%maenos2> NotLikeThis
[0:59:53] <%valriot> God i hate that chrono rune LUL
[0:59:58] <+Jolnir> Doom: A great relationship with the kids Edition
[1:00:00] <ABakedDemon> @YakumoYomi Honestly I think I agree, I just replayed 2016 after eternal and preferred some things about it, it still had some platforming but different for sure
[1:00:07] <Pookiedaexzile> The Marriage has turned Pat into a a dad
[1:00:21] <KaiserMario> Oh, here comes Bowser Castle shit
[1:00:24] <ABakedDemon> I like the platforming and exploration though
[1:00:25] <%peachy996> It doesn't make the platforming better
[1:00:40] <%valriot> The DI rune is the best imo, and the faster equipment time
[1:00:41] <Kalarchis> The fuck is this Mario shit
[1:00:43] <Theoyveyman> You ready for  V I D E O  G A M E  environments?
[1:00:51] <MyNameIsRasus> nice
[1:00:51] <%vaporousTippler> If you weren't convinced by now that Doom Eternal was just Mario...
[1:00:55] <%BoxNavy> that was gamign
[1:01:02] <brachydios777> The movement in Eternal gives so much more options though
[1:01:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Theoyveyman FUCK YES I AM

[1:01:56] <+SaltySombrero> OH NO THE PURPLE GOOP
[1:01:58] <brachydios777> Isn’t Mirrors Edge technically a platformer?
[1:01:58] <AoG_JarlRaven> cacodemons are trivialized so hard by grenades in this game
[1:01:58] <spawnzie> THE GOOP
[1:01:59] <%vaporousTippler> Mirror's Edge was a big fat okay.

[1:06:21] <%RetroCop87> you guys realize that if you keep spamming emathook, he's not gonna use the meathook, right?
[1:06:23] <%crazyspartan214> NERD!!!
[1:06:26] <fap_to_sherrys_legs> Good Guy Intern
[1:06:29] <brachydios777> Intern is a Bud
[1:06:29] <Zebroneath> time to SMASH
[1:06:31] <KaiserMario> Ah yes, the Adoring Fan
[1:06:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> The second biggest balled person in the world
[1:06:34] <%TONYOO101> the dlc makes me feel like they got sandy peterson or some of the old devs who made the real dickish doom expansions to come back and design a few encounters, like  plutonia
[1:06:37] <%valriot> TIME FOR BONK, GO TO DEMON JAIL
[1:06:39] <%peachy996> This hammer is awesome and makes the Crucible look like babby's first argent weapon
[1:06:41] <+BusterRepukken> thanks Kratos
[1:06:44] <Gutsandlove> intern the best
[1:06:44] <mybigmeech> TIME FOR BONK

[1:07:01] <brachydios777> HAMMER TIME
[1:07:02] <%Jaxnos> THAT LOOKS LIKE SOME HYPE SHIT
[1:07:02] <spawnzie> I LIKE THE BONK
[1:07:03] <xbb1024> Intern needs to get paid
[1:07:05] <Ner234> B O N K

[1:07:09] <%solracc25> YEAH
[1:07:11] <MyNameIsRasus> TO HORNY JAIL WITH YOU, SATAN
[1:07:12] <trfurkanrey18> @TONYOO101  exactly how I felt for TAG1 and it was amazing, as for this one; it was underwhelming
[1:07:13] <pmmori> the hammer is the best thing that could have been added to this game
[1:07:14] <%DedlokPM> rooBonk
[1:07:14] <Chester_goes_Berserk> I dunno about intern, he signed off on this super dumb plan
[1:07:17] <%MugenSandan> GO TO HORNY JAIL
[1:07:20] <%Niney_Who> ew
[1:07:21] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[1:07:23] <user_naim> Man this hammer is so good
[1:07:25] <samuelfisk> That was abrupt
[1:07:25] <%ssjklyco> That's right
[1:07:26] <Pookiedaexzile> @RetroCop87 I'm hoping for that so bad, spite ignoring a mechanic into giving up on the game would make my night
[1:07:27] <+BettyMwwaahh> you wanted a controller
[1:07:28] <MyNameIsRasus> THEY RAN OUT OF BUTTONS LUL
[1:07:30] <mike2hands> they're getting out of buttons
[1:07:32] <+Irridium> same as the sword
[1:07:32] <spawnzie> Where the crucible used to be
[1:07:34] <%Daxalog> Its got range
[1:07:37] <%Valdorick> YOOOOO
[1:07:38] <brachydios777> It’s better than the cruicible
[1:07:39] <Darkfire346> S T O P  Hammer time!
[1:07:39] <Ner234> That's just silly
[1:07:40] <%peachy996> You'll get used to it if you require it alot
[1:07:41] <%BoxNavy> OH SHIT
[1:07:48] <Zebroneath> Combo that shit
[1:07:50] <Theoyveyman> HAMMER DOWN
[1:07:51] <%valriot> YEAAAAA

[1:07:57] <Ipsenscastle> that's amazing
[1:08:02] <%Daxalog> Hammer has range
[1:08:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BONK
[1:08:05] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Giving me Final Boss Veigar flashbacks with these sound effects
[1:08:08] <Josef_Stryker> HAMMER DOWN
[1:08:10] <spawnzie> psst you can do both at once
[1:08:12] <Theoyveyman> GET THE CHART READY
[1:08:14] <%Burdenslo> Too much tech, this game is insane

[1:08:25] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> sounds arcady
[1:08:26] <%valriot> You can stun Maruarders after you counter them LUL
[1:08:27] <Ipsenscastle> NOOOOO
[1:08:30] <Josef_Stryker> OH NOOOOO
[1:08:32] <%Jaxnos> i hope you have your notepad out to take notes for the exam later
[1:08:33] <levitcleos> no Hammer Time jokes?
[1:08:33] <spawnzie> yay my favorite....
[1:08:36] <%UvBenServed> yaaaaay
[1:08:40] <%Valdorick> Sword is no longer my best friend. Sentinel Hammer is my new best friend.
[1:08:40] <%solracc25> BONKAI

[1:08:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @levitcleos None
[1:08:50] <%Niney_Who> So many Revenants
[1:08:57] <+EdenOfLove> @PatStaresAt you're gonna be using that hammer a LOT during this dlc so get used to it
[1:09:01] <Ipsenscastle> @user_naim welp there we go LUL
[1:09:03] <+Delenay> i missed the start. why is doomguy in this place idk
[1:09:04] <%JoshManVGH> I am so NOT relaxed by this game and I'm only watching it. Bloodborne is more relaxing.
[1:09:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Was that a buff totem?
[1:09:04] <KaiserMario> Hey kids, you wanna see the devil? You name it "the devil" and the kids'll come! The kids love "the devil"!
[1:09:09] <fap_to_sherrys_legs> plutonia???
[1:09:14] <user_naim> @ipsenscastle yup
[1:09:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Delenay to get back into the heart of hell
[1:09:23] <user_naim> Didn’t want to say anything
[1:09:30] <%WhereIsWill> psaCaco psaCaco psaCaco
[1:09:34] <%peachy996> You can Bomb the Caco when he's stunned too
[1:09:34] <%valriot> GO TO HORNY JAIL
[1:09:34] <spawnzie> @PatStaresAt dont hesitate to use the hammer it refills fast
[1:09:37] <brachydios777> It’s so good!
[1:09:39] <Zebroneath> It's goofy, but I love it
[1:09:39] <+Cobaltor_252> its so goofy I love it
[1:09:44] <%Monkeyweed21> SEND THE DEMONS TO HORNY HELL
[1:09:44] <%Jaxnos> i wish it just straight up was an air hammer that played a lloney tunes bonk effect
[1:09:45] <T_Sasquatch> nu-dooms color pallette is so weird
[1:09:47] <%dekkitout> BOP Horny jail is the true hell
[1:09:47] <%MugenSandan> oh my god I thought the video game noises were for the tutorial
[1:09:48] <Pookiedaexzile> This is a Video game
[1:09:50] <penitentpendant> I'm curious where they got the feedback for some of these changes
[1:09:52] <%Jaxnos> looney tunes*
[1:09:54] <%toolofparanoia> well this is a video game
[1:09:55] <+Delenay> just a different path there then, hes going to kill the negadoomguy right
[1:09:58] <ABakedDemon> I think doom eternal embraced that feeling in general
[1:09:58] <Pookiedaexzile> This is a Video game ass video game
[1:09:59] <mike2hands> TO HORNY HELL WITH YOU
[1:09:59] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Look at this video game ass video game right here
[1:10:00] <fap_to_sherrys_legs> "There are more revenants than there are stars in the sky." -some head guy
[1:10:03] <ChungusQuest> Would you say it's...bonkers?
[1:10:04] <xbb1024> Doom guy himself is a nerd, so he probably customised it that way
[1:10:13] <T_Sasquatch> its edgy and helly with neon lights and bright pinks
[1:10:14] <StarmanJay> @penitentpendant Not from the players, that's for sure
[1:10:16] <%peachy996> I didn't know that it did
[1:10:19] <%vaporousTippler> Doom Eternal's a borderline parody.
[1:10:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Meathook
[1:10:34] <Ipsenscastle> it's hammertime I guess
[1:10:34] <%BoxNavy> alright :)
[1:10:46] <negrosnake9185> It doesn’t hurt you
[1:10:49] <%toolofparanoia> doom guy has a gaming rig and plays guitar of course he's a nerd
[1:11:07] <%peachy996> I'm glad it refills after 2 Glory Kills, makes it more fun to loop
[1:11:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Of course Doom guy is a nerd look at his abs he counts marcos
[1:11:36] <+Nomenanza> it's  a fucking Space Kadet pinball noise
[1:11:57] <%Lion_kun> is it just me or is this dlc pathetically easy?
[1:11:59] <+BusterRepukken> or a commander keen noise
[1:12:10] <pochiyeah> playing this on console looks hard af
[1:12:28] <+panlakes> This game would be perfect if they removed all the platforming, it was too long and tedious. might go back for the DLC if they reduced that a bit
[1:12:33] <%peachy996> @Lion_kun It has 1 or 2 tough spots later but yeah they toned it down sadly
[1:12:36] <%toolofparanoia> its gonna ramp up eventually
[1:12:40] <T_Sasquatch> the more i play console fps the more i just wish for a wider fov
[1:12:42] <+l3sovikk> Spirits are the worst thing to come out of doom
[1:12:59] <%valriot> @panlakes Actually get good though. The platforming takes like 3 seconds
[1:13:15] <%peachy996> @l3sovikk There's something worse coming up later
[1:13:37] <%Burdenslo> Man I couldn’t handle playing this game on controller! My hands would become like spaghetti
[1:13:58] <nuane> big boys
[1:13:58] <%valriot> Possessed are like the one thing im iffy on, simply cos they ignore mechanics, but thats it tbh
[1:14:00] <%toolofparanoia> TYRANT
[1:14:00] <KaiserMario> Bfg time
[1:14:06] <SaltyAzteca> Saiba Demon
[1:14:08] <MyNameIsRasus> i miss gauss chan
[1:14:09] <kingmemelord97> welcome to the thunderdome
[1:14:16] <+l3sovikk> @peachy996 No there's not. I've been through this whole dlc already. Nothing is worse than the spirits. Force you into using a shitty mod and stand in place
[1:14:23] <Pookiedaexzile> This game would be perfect if It just let me not play half the game or use half the mechanics
[1:14:37] <%peachy996> @l3sovikk I think the new Prowler is way worse
[1:14:37] <Pookiedaexzile> :)
[1:14:51] <%valriot> @l3sovikk Microwave is actually super underrated
[1:15:18] <+aspirationdeath> @pookiedaexzile you can. its called weapon swapping
[1:15:19] <+OrangeMDT> What riveting commentary /s
[1:15:23] <%Burdenslo> @pookiedaexzile in all fairness I don’t think I fired off a single grenade so you can avoid that at least
[1:15:27] <%Lion_kun> I just think 2016 was this perfect mix of mechanics and difficulties and eternal just makes the game too bloated with mechanics
[1:15:28] <+l3sovikk> @l3sovikk Makes you too slow, and heat blast is just too good. Blows off weak points and gives damage amp at full charge
[1:15:30] <spawnzie> @PatStaresAt you can ice bomb while microwavin the spirit and it wont break the beam
[1:15:48] <Ipsenscastle> how on earth did Pat just find time to read chat, that was superhuman
[1:15:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> microwave is op for big bois
[1:15:51] <%valriot> Its underrated cos you can see health bars and stun Possessed
[1:15:58] <%peachy996> Microwave is good when you can alternate throwing Frag Grenades
[1:15:59] <+l3sovikk> Microwave is garbage
[1:16:02] <Zebroneath> It can stun the possessed if you need a breather
[1:16:02] <SaltyAzteca> nice
[1:16:04] <godzookylives> @PatStaresAt having fun yet?
[1:16:05] <+aspirationdeath> @pookiedaexzile you can just use shotty/ballista swap and eviscerate everything
[1:16:07] <%TONYOO101> you have to strafe and keep your crosshair on the dude with microwave
[1:16:09] <Kadraxan> you can tap microwave to stun, then swap weapons for a shot or three
[1:16:11] <bashful_bard> 2016 plays the same in almost every single fight
[1:16:15] <+BusterRepukken> 2016 is boring
[1:16:16] <%ArchimerCXV> chat's doing misery olympics about playing the game the right way, just ignore it
[1:16:27] <+l3sovikk> I will die on this hill
[1:16:28] <KaiserMario> Y'know, it wouldn't be a waste to use at least one BFG shot on those guys...
[1:16:29] <%AyotoCorp> Stunning possessed is a terrible idea when you need that ammo to kill the spirits
[1:16:31] <user_naim> I think it does stop the spirit buffed guys though
[1:16:36] <SomersaultJustice> I think you should shoot the things with the bang bangs
[1:16:42] <mybigmeech> SPEEEEN
[1:16:45] <%peachy996> Here is your third reskin: Stone Imps. Credit where it's due they make you use the forgotten part of a weapon
[1:16:46] <%valriot> Microwave can also just be a "No" button, cos it locks them in place for a second, good for chasing Barons ect
[1:16:46] <Kadraxan> also, unmaykr exists and is good for superheavies without using a lot of ammo at once
[1:16:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Boys boys, you're all pretty and beat the game without jumping or using a single extra life. I get it
[1:16:53] <ABakedDemon> They sonic roll at you lmao
[1:16:53] <%ringabal> WE GOT BLANKA BALLS NOW
[1:16:57] <+BusterRepukken> after playing this, i cant play 2016 anymore.
[1:16:58] <%DakotaMacDoodle> these guys are fun
[1:17:04] <kilmas09> Pat try to switch weapons mid attacks against heavy enemies. it saves ammo and it's a fast dps. Balista+one rocket+super shotgun as an example
[1:17:05] <%AzureGale> The stone imp took too much weeeeeeeeeeeed
[1:17:21] <%toolofparanoia> Why would the dark lord make imps out of stone?
[1:17:22] <spawnzie> "please guys i'm begging you to use full auto"
[1:17:25] <brachydios777> Sonic Imps
[1:17:30] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Full Auto finally got a reason to exist past early game
[1:17:34] <spawnzie> you can also chainsaw them
[1:17:49] <nuane> I don't like how you're forced to use certain mods now, before you options but now its "use this or die"
[1:17:52] <%peachy996> Out of all the reskins, I think they're the most okay
[1:17:55] <kingmemelord97> @toolofparanoia mass confusion
[1:18:00] <OverlordedK> I'd always use full auto to break the doom hunter sleds
[1:18:01] <brachydios777> That chainsaw is strong af
[1:18:04] <Theoyveyman> They barely look like stone
[1:18:06] <%Tman451> I wish Imps werent fodder
[1:18:07] <%Piemen99> im getting big skeleton wheel vibes
[1:18:14] <%toolofparanoia> seems legit
[1:18:23] <kilmas09> you can insta kill stone imps with the chaingun shield dash
[1:18:27] <jbmay> imagine being so strong that you tell doomguy  "you can only kill me with these 2 weapons. otherwise go fuck yourself"
[1:18:32] <KaiserMario> Don't waste it...
[1:18:35] <+BusterRepukken> how are you forced to use certain mods, i dont get why people keep saying this
[1:18:36] <%peachy996> There's a small easter egg around here
[1:18:42] <brachydios777> Hammer also insta kills these guys
[1:18:50] <%peachy996> There's like an old Doom sprite on one of the destroyed bridges
[1:19:03] <kingmemelord97> tearing ?
[1:19:11] <D4N5T3P> @jbmay but you can kill it with any weapon, it'll just take a bit longer
[1:19:11] <%toolofparanoia> can barely tell on my end
[1:19:14] <+panlakes> do you have freesync
[1:19:18] <%AyotoCorp> Hammer is limited use and the game tells you outright only the shotgun damages them
[1:19:18] <%ElkRiverDog> !uptime
[1:19:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 19m.
[1:19:32] <Sundaysmiles01> WHY IS IT SO GREEN???
[1:19:40] <Sundaysmiles01> I need muh demon lava
[1:19:44] <%ArchimerCXV> there he is
[1:19:47] <%valriot> YEEEEEEEEE
[1:19:48] <Ipsenscastle> LUL what
[1:19:49] <+Nomenanza> uh oh
[1:19:49] <spawnzie> that's the noise of the armor respawning
[1:19:50] <%Jaxnos> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:19:50] <mike2hands> HUH?
[1:19:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:19:51] <SaltyAzteca> ohhhh nice
[1:19:51] <%UvBenServed> dmol
[1:19:51] <%toolofparanoia> JPEG
[1:19:52] <+BusterRepukken> @AyotoCorp except thats not true at all lol
[1:19:55] <%UvBenServed> smol
[1:19:57] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah you found it
[1:19:58] <Theoyveyman> REMEMBER CHILDHOOD
[1:19:59] <Darkfire346> wut
[1:20:09] <+hungriest_of_joes> howdy pat
[1:20:09] <brachydios777> Classic
[1:20:09] <%Jaxnos> IT'S LIKE THE LIL LUIGIS
[1:20:10] <ABakedDemon> Oh shit this the part you're gonna love pat
[1:20:10] <Theoyveyman> REMEMBER IT CONSUMER
[1:20:12] <+panlakes> great easter egg lol
[1:20:16] <+aspirationdeath> even marauder has other ways than intended to kill him. people just dont want to get creative. doesnt help that the game shoves tips and tutorials down your throat telling you how the game "should" be played
[1:20:17] <%AyotoCorp> It's not true that the game says "only the rapid shotgun mod"?
[1:20:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIGHT THE SIGNAL
[1:20:20] <Darkfire346> FIRE IT UP
[1:20:22] <%peachy996> That sound you hear is the Armor Pickups refilling
[1:20:23] <%primarch_lupercal> World spear is a very cool name
[1:20:24] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Did you deliberately chose to wear red for Doom?
[1:20:24] <Sundaysmiles01> beat his ass with the torch
[1:20:27] <%AzureGale> Is the world spear made from the world tree
[1:20:32] <%toolofparanoia> DOOM GUY IS MAGIC
[1:20:35] <%Anime_Flux> dammit I really wish I'd gotten here at the beginning, I really enjoy this storyline
[1:20:35] <mesamus> heres your LOTR ref
[1:20:36] <+BusterRepukken> @aspirationdeath I agree, the tutorials make people think one way.
[1:20:38] <+hungriest_of_joes> bearer of the curse, seek souls
[1:20:45] <armchairmaster_> Oh look, da multiplayer armor from the multiplayer they FUCKING REMOVED for no reason
[1:20:47] <Darkfire346> GONDOR CALLS FOR AID
[1:20:50] <%Anime_Flux> Gondor calls for aid!
[1:20:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Doom Souls
[1:20:58] <%ssjklyco> Did this become Halo?
[1:20:59] <%BoxNavy> :O

[1:30:38] <Ipsenscastle> snow levels are the BEST
[1:30:38] <%maybefalco> snow levels are pretty cool
[1:30:39] <%AzureGale> The music of snow levels is usually pretty raed

[1:30:50] <%justcallmebobplease> You like the sterile, lifeless feel, don't you Pat
[1:30:51] <%moonmintparadise> Autumn levels are so much better than snow levels
[1:30:51] <%toolofparanoia> snow in Doom is a nince change of pace
[1:30:52] <brachydios777> I love how the dragon is specifically the Doom Slayer because it has his logo
[1:30:56] <jorniev> so many game engines named after snow
[1:30:56] <bufflb> pat likes this dlc because it's for babies

[1:55:03] <bashful_bard> Oh it just tells you huh

[1:55:09] <%ShogunNoonto> do combo
[1:55:11] <$realm_forge> Super Slayer Blue
[1:55:13] <brachydios777> Make maraurders your bitch
[1:55:14] <Darkfire346> ITS "PURPLE"
[1:55:18] <Hydrapissed> it is a stun extender
[1:55:18] <%AzureGale> Use the Sentinel hammer on demonic spiders to annihilate them
[1:55:18] <Ner234> B O N K
[1:55:19] <comicalmond9135> everything is a nail
[1:55:23] <+DarkDsion> skin and a background  for the menu
[1:55:24] <%moonmintparadise> marauders are so easy now with the combos haha
[1:55:38] <DanThePumpkinman> i kinda want the hammer noise as a text tone lol
[1:55:45] <%toastybites> @toastybites any lore drops about hayden yet
[1:55:48] <%peachy996> I never got the combos down personally
[1:55:51] <Hydrapissed> the windows pin ball noise
[1:56:05] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah I think it only extends, doesn't start stun by itself
[1:56:07] <brachydios777> Did it miss?
[1:56:19] <Hydrapissed> yep stun extender
[1:56:19] <+LandOfTheWay> i straight up forgot these hammer bros fuckers existed
[1:56:33] <anuchallengertwitch> The Hammer extends stun states
[1:56:40] <%peachy996> farm leftover fodder for Glory Kill
[1:56:51] <Hydrapissed> a stun state will be extended via the hammer
[1:56:53] <Louie_Salmon> Man this game has a lot of buttons that do different things huh
[1:57:28] <kilmas09> you do have to use the hammer immediately after shooting the marauder once he green flahes, otherwise he wont falter
[1:57:30] <Hydrapissed> it charges off weak point shots to
[1:57:32] <Hydrapissed> so even faster
[1:57:32] <Krakenoid> when in doubt you gotta press buttons
[1:57:54] <ScreamLord> What happened to your sword?
[1:58:13] <anuchallengertwitch> @ScreamLord  shoved it into the Icon of Sin's brain
[1:58:16] <deviljhojho_> maurauding hard or hardly marauding
[1:58:21] <Louie_Salmon> @ScreamLord It's in the final boss of the main campaign
[1:58:27] <nintega010> woolie worse enemy
[1:58:33] <+BettyMwwaahh> the tutorials popping up before you even fight the enemy is lame
[1:58:33] <blackbookalpha> T-Pose
[1:58:36] <anuchallengertwitch> It needs to stay there in order for it to stay dead
[1:58:36] <huskarl_zap> T pose on em
[1:58:39] <%DedlokPM> Come on out Marauder Shields!
[1:58:42] <user_naim> Mister 0/75
[1:58:46] <lets_be_friendos> nerfed
[1:58:46] <brachydios777> Nice shot
[1:58:50] <%BoxNavy> wow you reeeeeeally need to headshot them
[1:58:57] <+TensecondTarvis> what difficulty is he playing?
[1:58:58] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:59:05] <nintega010> woolie can't
[1:59:05] <Ipsenscastle> that was impressive
[1:59:09] <%RyderTiliqua> "Are you a snapshot king?"
[1:59:13] <Louie_Salmon> And boy will that be stressful when there's also 10 other enemies around
[1:59:20] <%peachy996> Not without slowdown I can't
[1:59:27] <OverlordedK> I never thought to use that for them instead of the sniper...
[1:59:37] <ScreamLord> @Louie_Salmon @anuchallengertwitch Wait, that makes him loose the Crucible? I thought he just snapped off a blade in it like he did for Titan when he first reclaimed it?
[1:59:40] <%Monkeyweed21> with big auto aim
[1:59:45] <user_naim> I guess Pat didn’t even need the slowdown
[1:59:48] <%toolofparanoia> the chest rip open glory kill on the prowler is one of the most brutal i think
[1:59:57] <thepenguinprince> Ew. That brain has a face
[2:00:05] <huskarl_zap> Are the empowered enemies players?
[2:00:06] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> ephie_aka_pulpy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! I haven’t gotten a chance to play  any of the Doom Eternal expansions yet. They look great. Hope you and the fam are doing well!
[2:00:23] <+BusterRepukken> @huskarl_zap they're demons whove killed other players
[2:00:34] <bashful_bard> Empowered demons used to be players
[2:00:36] <huskarl_zap> I see
[2:00:43] <anuchallengertwitch> @ScreamLord  yes he lost the blade because of that. He needed to snap off the blade in order for it to stay dead. I guess he just never went back and made a new blade end
[2:01:01] <huskarl_zap> So player invasion were never added even though it was shown at E3
[2:01:01] <bashful_bard> Atm they're static spawns in the dlc
[2:01:19] <$RealThiele> damn disposable hellswords
[2:01:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @huskarl_zap they did add them Pat disabled it
[2:01:24] <%peachy996> And no Marauder lol
[2:01:30] <huskarl_zap> ok
[2:01:37] <OverlordedK> I really don't get why give that marauder tutorial there then don't have you fight one there LUL
[2:01:39] <%peachy996> The game gets you ready for it just to surprise you with big tentacle
[2:02:06] <mr_saturday93> I forgot Bout the player invasion shit
[2:02:13] <PhantonBat> Use meathook to video game

[2:02:40] <AShinyVagikarp> Archdragon Peak?
[2:02:40] <%ArchimerCXV> it really is literally anything vaguely norse, huh?
[2:02:44] <+BettyMwwaahh> Sif with a gun would be nuts
[2:02:46] <Krakenoid> imagine having to fight Sif, but instead of a big sword, its a big gun
[2:02:48] <%AncelDeLambert> ROM YOU FUCKER I'M COMING FOR YOU
[2:02:54] <%solracc25> Until it' s done

[2:02:56] <%dekkitout> Is Excalibur on the other side of this fog?
[2:02:56] <+shaidot> Gilgamesh!?
[2:02:57] <ranarath> Gonna fight Rom in the lake?
[2:03:01] <%Ne1son> Is he really dead tho
[2:03:02] <%peachy996> Welll
[2:03:03] <PhantonBat> Confirmed Pat's a game journalist
[2:03:04] <OverlordedK> you didn't kill him pat, you just didn't revive him
[2:03:04] <+BettyMwwaahh> hes alive. as a presence
[2:03:05] <Louie_Salmon> Ariandel?
[2:03:06] <mr_saturday93> the father isn't dead pat...
[2:03:07] <penitentpendant> He's vocal for a dead god
[2:03:07] <+LandOfTheWay> eh, he don't need a body
[2:03:09] <%Xelhesia> shhhhhhhhhh
[2:03:10] <%Monkeyweed21> he got better
[2:03:10] <+BusterRepukken> i think you';re confusing the Father and Samur
[2:03:10] <Pookiedaexzile> You didn't
[2:03:11] <Theoyveyman> PART THE RED SEA WITH YOUR BEYBLADE DOOM MAN
[2:03:13] <mr_saturday93> Pat is dumb
[2:03:16] <SunsetJack> Isn't father Vega?
[2:03:17] <%peachy996> You killed his physical form
[2:03:17] <AShinyVagikarp> ORB
[2:03:20] <%Ne1son> He's god tho
[2:03:24] <mr_saturday93> Pat is smooth brain
[2:03:25] <$realm_forge> Cut to the Rom boss fight from bloodbourne
[2:03:25] <anuchallengertwitch> Father is Vega, and Vega is good boy
[2:03:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PhantonBat hey pat actually contributes to society
[2:03:28] <bashful_bard> It's really unclear how that worked
[2:03:28] <spongeofmystery> Vergil is up there
[2:03:30] <heart_ablaze> killed his body, not spirit
[2:03:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> He just can't take physical form ever again
[2:03:31] <Pookiedaexzile> He is Program now
[2:03:32] <Louie_Salmon> Anor Londo?
[2:03:33] <%Monkeyweed21> it just means he doesnt get a body
[2:03:33] <brachydios777> Killed his soul not his mind I guess
[2:03:34] <Krakenoid> imagine Sif doing big devil may cry gun combos
[2:03:34] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt You smashed the orb that was going to revive him
[2:03:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Holy SHIT this is pretty
[2:03:38] <%arcielardor> he forgives you
[2:03:39] <%BoxNavy> 👁️
[2:03:41] <Louie_Salmon> Crystal Caves?
[2:03:42] <kilmas09> he can't take physical form due to the sphere being destroyed, but he aint dead
[2:03:46] <%solracc25> Father is VEGA
[2:03:46] <SunsetJack> On brand
[2:03:47] <user_naim> Orb is the soul, Father is what’s left of the mind
[2:03:47] <mr_saturday93> The orb was just to revive him into a mortal body not kill him
[2:03:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Eyegina
[2:03:52] <+TheMorilo> just got here, thought this was Final Fantasy XII for a second
[2:03:52] <anuchallengertwitch> Yes, but the Father's essence is still around. he just can't have a physical form now
[2:03:55] <%vehementvadr> fort stares at
[2:03:56] <%AzureGale> Oh no, it's made of Soul Calibur
[2:04:01] <%AncelDeLambert> this is pretty eldritch
[2:04:01] <Chester_goes_Berserk> the father was really chill about losing his body
[2:04:03] <Ipsenscastle> @Krakenoid Sif was only using Swordmaster this whole time
[2:04:04] <Pookiedaexzile> THis Pussy Sees all
[2:04:06] <mr_saturday93> Let's all just agree that Pat is an isiot
[2:04:07] <%dekkitout> Ocular orbs 👁️
[2:04:07] <Theoyveyman> Are we on the Bionis Arm?
[2:04:12] <ABakedDemon> Cthhulu space rock

[2:04:23] <Krakenoid> it was aliens the whole time doomguy
[2:04:26] <+shaidot> very xenoblade
[2:04:26] <anuchallengertwitch> Also Samur was just doing what the Father told him to do
[2:04:29] <ranarath> @mr_saturday93 We very much do.  LUL
[2:04:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no not Xen

[2:04:42] <Krakenoid> I hope nothing bad happens to that intern
[2:04:57] <%BoxNavy> masher monkaS
[2:04:59] <Louie_Salmon> Love that an intern is still your main line of communication on this
[2:05:07] <+TheMorilo> Black Mesa Xen 2
[2:05:08] <anuchallengertwitch> So not even HEAVEN Dimension, gave off readings like this
[2:05:18] <%BoxNavy> dont get mashed monkaS
[2:05:20] <%peachy996> Refilling Armor Pickups to make the platforming more forgiving
[2:05:35] <Krakenoid> honestly they should move that intern to a full paid position
[2:05:40] <%arcielardor> pounding Doom vagina eye columns
[2:05:43] <mr_saturday93> gg pat uh
[2:05:55] <anuchallengertwitch> This set piece and the way Doomguy traverses it reminds me of Samurai Jack
[2:06:05] <+Delenay> how?
[2:06:08] <Ipsenscastle> Is this Xen?
[2:06:09] <Krakenoid> all these eyes are giving off an old bible angel vibe
[2:06:09] <brachydios777> LUL
[2:06:18] <+Delenay> oooh draenei paladins
[2:06:19] <$realm_forge> I’m getting Metroid prime vibes from this level

[2:06:25] <%BoxNavy> ?

[2:06:27] <Louie_Salmon> Uh
[2:06:27] <+TheBitingIrish> ???
[2:06:33] <ABakedDemon> Time limit

[2:10:37] <%holydeviant1> Doomguy is all like, where all the dee mones
[2:10:39] <%Burdenslo> I prefer earth when it was overrun by demons
[2:10:40] <ScreamLord> The planets recovered quickly after the earth was lit on fire
[2:10:41] <%real_life_ghost> This looks like Destiny.
[2:10:46] <Louie_Salmon> The DARK LORD

[2:12:29] <Theoyveyman> Do you think ID is just forbidden from calling to the Dark Lord as Satan?
[2:12:39] <%bapposbungers> Nice shot
[2:12:42] <MyNameIsRasus> I'm expecting "You are cursed" reaction images by tomorrow morning
[2:12:45] <%BoxNavy> oh shit
[2:13:01] <ergulor> bop it
[2:13:25] <%toolofparanoia> how have we not fought a marauder yet

[2:13:38] <+BusterRepukken> @toolofparanoia ;) ;) ;)
[2:13:40] <MyNameIsRasus> that's not a dog sound
[2:13:42] <%bapposbungers> psaDogchamp
[2:13:43] <Ipsenscastle> the dog is doing Djent snoring
[2:13:46] <MyNameIsRasus> that's a xenomorph sound
[2:13:49] <%BoxNavy> is that noise him?
[2:13:50] <%AzureGale> Awww
[2:13:56] <%dekkitout> psaDogchamp No u
[2:13:57] <user_naim> Vibin
[2:13:58] <atgithursdays> Oh good dog talk I don't care about
[2:13:58] <Theoyveyman> Why is Hell fair game, but you have to come up with these alternate names for Heaven, angels, & Satan?
[2:14:00] <+BusterRepukken> save your work
[2:14:01] <%AzureGale> LUL
[2:14:15] <%walternatorz> pragmatic
[2:14:16] <+BusterRepukken> its now safe to turn off your computer
[2:14:18] <%bapposbungers> "The end is here. Run for your lives."
[2:14:18] <+NeonLight> Slayer's arrival is a natural disaster
[2:14:23] <+TheBitingIrish> I think it is
[2:14:26] <%BoxNavy> is it a bad sign that i cant tell zangief noises apart from DOOM noises?
[2:14:26] <brachydios777> @atgithursdays Go to a different streamer then man
[2:14:31] <%toolofparanoia> CAPITALISM TAKES NO BREAKS EVEN FOR THE END OF THE WORLD
[2:14:37] <KinduVborrd> Doomguy inspection, look busy
[2:14:42] <Louie_Salmon> OnlyTorso
[2:14:46] <%solracc25> ASSET REUSE
[2:15:01] <Theoyveyman> COOL ASSET REUSE
[2:15:17] <+TheBitingIrish> YEA
[2:15:27] <+BusterRepukken> video games reuse assets????? whattt??
[2:15:29] <ranarath> @Theoyveyman I imagine it's less of a they can't use this name, and more of a "Hey, this is the real stuff that heaven and hell are based on."
[2:15:35] <Louie_Salmon> Assets are bitches, re-use 'em all the way
[2:15:52] <pi_in_the_sci> this literally is the first level
[2:15:58] <%peachy996> Wonder if you'll get Cursed again
[2:16:02] <%solracc25> This plce
[2:16:07] <user_naim> God this track is the shit
[2:16:07] <%arcielardor> I'd love to see random groups of humans standing around in distant buildings cheering and occasionally getting eaten or blown up by stray shots like a Dethklok concert.
[2:16:14] <Louie_Salmon> I think they mean the building levels at the start of the main campaign, but they have sunlight and grass now. But like, whatever man
[2:16:19] <%Xevtes> using an enemy more than once? thats asset reuse /s
[2:16:37] <bashful_bard> It's like explicitly different in every feasibile way from level 1
[2:16:43] <%ShadowFoxoon> I want to see more games with reused assests from  other games they've worked on.  Give me more Tony Hawk in my Mortal Kombat
[2:16:48] <Louie_Salmon> Every doomguy effort grunt MUST be unique.
[2:16:53] <%the22cstomp> chat it's thematically consistent with the game who cares if it's reused lmao
[2:17:16] <%the22cstomp> i cant believe street fighter reused the shoryuken asset for 7 games
[2:17:17] <Louie_Salmon> Every time I pull out a gun it should look completely different, no asset reuse.
[2:17:21] <%peachy996> It's not even bad asset reuse if it is so I don't see the big deal
[2:17:38] <xbb1024> Post-hell earth must be rich in mineral resources now
[2:17:43] <+BusterRepukken> @the22cstomp yeah was about to say, if you have an issue with asset reuse, dont look at fighting gsames
[2:17:51] <Theoyveyman> They have a guy captive at the studio, & his grunts are being streamed live into the game
[2:17:55] <+Cobaltor_252> how tf is this asset reuse, the architecture just looks similar
[2:17:58] <%peachy996> Oh man don't play Tekken
[2:17:59] <+Cobaltor_252> yall are dumb
[2:18:02] <%JoshManVGH> Try shootings them, that's a neat trick
[2:18:04] <BoomerSqueaker> Damn Pat is really focused rn LUL
[2:18:13] <%BoxNavy> i always thought it was cool how the enemies still fight you even though you shoot most of their meat off of their bones
[2:18:14] <%arcielardor> one guy
[2:18:14] <pi_in_the_sci> it's geometry reuse and it does a good job of showing the impact of your actions.  I like it
[2:18:15] <BoomerSqueaker> PogChamp
[2:18:16] <+BusterRepukken> dont play any old KOF games
[2:18:21] <%the22cstomp> god that guitar wind down is so fucking good
[2:18:28] <OverlordedK> hammer makes this dlc way more fun in general
[2:18:33] <lets_be_friendos> only cause it's easier :)
[2:18:42] <%toolofparanoia> I wonder if sam is going to come back?
[2:18:51] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:18:55] <%ShadowFoxoon> New Game + Doom
[2:18:56] <+BusterRepukken> just mod it in
[2:18:57] <%dekkitout> Is there no ng+?
[2:18:57] <Theoyveyman> YOU CAN
[2:18:59] <bashful_bard> I wish there was a ng+
[2:19:02] <%peachy996> I would love to play the whole game and TAG1 with Hammer
[2:19:02] <%BoxNavy> theres mods apparently
[2:19:03] <Louie_Salmon> Do the master levels do that?
[2:19:04] <OverlordedK> That'd be nice
[2:19:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> mods
[2:19:14] <+Cobaltor_252> @Theoyveyman you can't
[2:19:14] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Waiting for that complete master level pack
[2:19:16] <%JoshManVGH> Isn't there a level select?
[2:19:19] <brachydios777> There’s mods on pc
[2:19:23] <Theoyveyman> Oh

[2:19:36] <+BusterRepukken> the super gore nest master level is nutty, especially on classic
[2:19:37] <+BettyMwwaahh> they need to release ALL the master levels so i can go through the whole game on those
[2:19:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Doom Souls: Customize your choosen Un Doomed
[2:19:43] <brachydios777> He means base game

[2:21:28] <bashful_bard> Doom does kinda rule
[2:21:33] <%dekkitout> You think the intern is canonized as like a disciple/apostate?
[2:21:33] <%the22cstomp> i want to see a doom3 remake where it's the same game but you have doom eternal movement
[2:21:37] <MyNameIsRasus> everyone should have an otacon
[2:21:40] <KinduVborrd> I have to finish it
[2:21:44] <BoneofMalkav> Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 are pretty awesome even with their no vertical aiming limitations
[2:21:44] <user_naim> DOOM is eternal
[2:21:50] <+OneGorillionDollars> people complain about this level as is 2016 didnt have "Argent Facility (Destroyed)" as a separate level

[2:23:28] <huskarl_zap> RIOT GUARD
[2:23:29] <lets_be_friendos> calling these guys chaingunners in an insult to the og chaingunners
[2:23:40] <%peachy996> Careful if you die from environmental damage, no extra life to take back
[2:23:44] <CappuccinoGuil> Dude tried to T-pose to assert dominance and he dieded
[2:23:54] <%valriot> OG Chaingunners sucked anyway
[2:23:59] <ergulor> because you restored the power
[2:24:05] <BoneofMalkav> It's electric (Boogie Woogie Woogie)

[2:24:33] <KinduVborrd> T-Pose to fill your DT gauge and boost your Style
[2:24:35] <%peachy996> I think this room was legit fun despite dying a bunch of times, but you'll probably hate it
[2:24:37] <%dekkitout> How else do trains move?
[2:24:40] <+BettyMwwaahh> if it has the symbol of the Beast, you gotta punch it
[2:24:42] <KinduVborrd> Motherfucker suplexed a train

[2:25:11] <user_naim> pt. 2
[2:25:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @Daxalog I don't understand this, you punch trains to ride them.

[2:25:21] <OverlordedK> this is the room I spent the most time in all the DLC LUL
[2:25:24] <MyNameIsRasus> YEAH THAT'S CORRECT

[2:25:49] <%BoxNavy> do empowered cacodemons not eat grenades?
[2:25:52] <user_naim> I appreciate that the first heart of the nest is the weak one, then comes the Slayer Gate version for the second wave
[2:25:55] <Louie_Salmon> Man this game is rad
[2:26:00] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i feel like the first gore nest is the hardest
[2:26:06] <MyNameIsRasus> not as rad as this suit

[2:27:36] <%dekkitout> How was ghost dog not an ability for doomguy
[2:27:37] <impulse255dj> this legit is probably the most difficult room in the DLC. Everything else is trivial compared to this room.

[2:33:15] <OverlordedK> it's just a free full heal LUL
[2:33:17] <+Saggitori> BUSSIN MAKED ME FEEL GOOD
[2:33:27] <%peachy996> Whats that sound?
[2:33:28] <$realm_forge> Fuck it I’m making a prop of that fuckin hammer
[2:33:36] <%bapposbungers> Doom looks like a fucking video game from someones dream
[2:33:36] <Pizzoots> @Saggitori stop it. get some help
[2:33:37] <%peachy996> Oh just a Marauder
[2:33:39] <%BoxNavy> ! ARCHVILE INCOMING !
[2:33:47] <%Puhff> Yeah this game seems needlessly difficult and complicated for a FPS
[2:33:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> @louie_salmon Like a Destiny or a Borderlands or a Shadow Warrior 2
[2:33:57] <KaiserMario> If this was DLC Part 1, there'd be like 3 Arch-Viles, 2 Marauders, 2 Doom Hunters and 2 Tyrants by now
[2:33:58] <garbageheaphound> NICE
[2:33:58] <%Deadpal> Nice one pat
[2:34:00] <%peachy996> God I love these Marauder Combos
[2:34:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @realm_forge its mostly just acrylic
[2:34:02] <%Deadpal> good maradur kill!
[2:34:09] <Qsmash_> there are Street Fighter stuns in this game?
[2:34:14] <+Cobaltor_252> @Puhff LUL
[2:34:15] <ChungusQuest> That hammer is making straight-up pinball machine noises
[2:34:19] <+TopTieramisu> it's more character action than a classic fps
[2:34:21] <mesamus> hammer turns them into jobbers
[2:34:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Just get some acrylic sheets cut it right and its done
[2:34:29] <lets_be_friendos> they really toned down the difficulty for this dlc and part1 for some reason
[2:34:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chat? Lets qnswer the question started by the SleepyCabin podcast all those years ago...Is it gay to suck your on dick? I'd say its pretty gay.
[2:34:32] <bashful_bard> It's a skill based fps. No shit it's gonna seem difficult
[2:34:33] <%Burdenslo> Shredded dayum
[2:34:34] <%arcielardor> marauders ain't shit now
[2:34:36] <+BusterRepukken> its the DMC5 of shooters
[2:34:36] <reasonance> now I really understand that podcast bit about doom becoming DMC
[2:34:54] <impulse255dj> @KaiserMario they have actually removed a bunch of monsters from DLC1 to make it more consistent with the rest of the game.
[2:34:54] <%ArchimerCXV> Real Talk: Expertly fucking done dude.
[2:34:57] <OverlordedK> goddamn this makes me wish I had lives for this room

[2:35:12] <%dekkitout> @sonofthedeepsouth I'd say it's bold and inventive- essentially very
[2:35:16] <+TheBitingIrish> @Puhff Would you rather stand in place and hold left click until everything is dead?
[2:35:16] <$realm_forge> At least the skin is cool
[2:35:17] <%Daxalog> But what if the next one is Purple?
[2:35:17] <garbageheaphound> Fuckin Legit well done

[2:36:00] <%Puhff> @TheBitingIrish No, I'd rather play a fun game.
[2:36:01] <%peachy996> Now that that's done you'll fly by the rest of the dlc
[2:36:06] <%BoxNavy> hold on demons we have to read this sick lore
[2:36:07] <mike2hands> bless you
[2:36:11] <+Ninjamaninjas> Why isn't it called the gate of Doom?
[2:36:11] <%Burdenslo> I really wish this game had a style meter
[2:36:43] <Theoyveyman> @patstaresat You should dub over all Prepare to Cry's
[2:36:54] <%Puhff> this plot is fucking stupid too LUL
[2:37:01] <corepercentlives> an effort was made

[2:37:03] <Pookiedaexzile> That does seem weird doesn't it :0
[2:37:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Gonna be honest I liked the story in doom 2016 more. Eternal story seems all over the place
[2:37:09] <Pookiedaexzile> How could this be
[2:37:13] <%Puhff> and not in a good way
[2:37:14] <%toastybites> Alexa, are you hiding from Satan?
[2:37:14] <MyNameIsRasus> You're a guy blood punching demons because your bunny died. when has it ever made sense
[2:37:40] <%toolofparanoia> "I play Doom for the plot"
[2:37:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean its a good reason for righteous fury
[2:37:45] <+BusterRepukken> people just come here to be annoying huh
[2:37:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Because its hammer time
[2:37:53] <%Daxalog> This is the hammer store
[2:37:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> No reason /shrug
[2:37:55] <+BettyMwwaahh> @PatStaresAt for fun
[2:37:57] <OverlordedK> it was a hammer fun room and you never went to the party part of it LUL

[2:40:00] <marvel877> BORK
[2:40:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @kewlmyc but they are not TOXIC water segmants
[2:40:13] <Theoyveyman> SWEEM
[2:40:14] <%bevyrage> they're now tolerable for not being timer based
[2:40:21] <bashful_bard> Kinda hope we get the hammer in some form in Doom 3 2

[2:41:08] <TakesGuts> it be do
[2:41:08] <%holydeviant1> neat
[2:41:08] <+Saggitori> rip
[2:41:08] <KaiserMario> hey guys, I don't remember if he mentioned it (I probably missed it), does anyone know if Woolie will be playing this on stream too?
[2:41:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Rad
[2:41:09] <BaronVonProlix> i thought he was the unwilling prohpet
[2:41:10] <bigben01> Robert Altman is also a famous movie director
[2:41:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> Doom now canon to dead space?
[2:41:12] <garbageheaphound> huh neat
[2:41:13] <+BusterRepukken> remember dead space
[2:41:14] <%Calliphor> He was also the Zenimax head that just died
[2:41:15] <+TheBitingIrish> Dead Space NotLikeThis
[2:41:15] <a_mad_dragon_> and he HATED it
[2:41:17] <+Cobaltor_252> Robert Altman is also a deceased fim director @PatStaresAt
[2:41:19] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh that guy WOULD have a Chairman's Club, the fuck
[2:41:20] <Theoyveyman> Might just be a coincidence
[2:41:21] <MyNameIsRasus> fucking nice catch dude
[2:41:21] <%TONYOO101> isnt he a real person
[2:41:25] <%ABakedDemon> Dead space is pretty similar to doom in some ways
[2:41:27] <KeystoneA2> @PatStaresAt Michael Altman. That guy is actually some guy that just died at iD
[2:41:33] <Tracazoid> Micheal Altman but close
[2:41:33] <%Arancet> No, Dead Space was MICHAEL Altman
[2:41:36] <+SH1NK1R0> I thought it was Michael altman
[2:41:36] <Ipsenscastle> that was a hell of a catch
[2:41:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> He had a very fufilling life it seems
[2:41:45] <pi_in_the_sci> there is a switch on the wall
[2:41:48] <BaronVonProlix> crazy talk
[2:41:50] <%Ne1son> Boomguy in Dead Space: how does he do?
[2:41:50] <+Saggitori> robert altman was the ceo of zenimax
[2:41:53] <%AncelDeLambert> He's also the creator of Unitology
[2:41:55] <%AncelDeLambert> MAKE US WHOLE
[2:41:59] <%AncelDeLambert> ISAAAAAAAC!
[2:42:02] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt Dead Space guy was MICHEAL Altman
[2:42:04] <+TheBitingIrish> OH
[2:42:20] <+TheBitingIrish> He was the co-founder of Zenimax and Bethesda FeelsBadMan
[2:42:21] <%Daxalog> Robert A. Altman, founder of Bethesda and id Software
[2:42:25] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:42:31] <SatansDelight> did they explain what happened to the sword cuz i really dont remember
[2:42:33] <MyNameIsRasus> in space no one can hear CRAZY TALK
[2:42:41] <%AzureGale> Except how to RIP and TEAR
[2:42:47] <%BoxNavy> did you skip it?
[2:42:52] <%peachy996> Interesting, maybe Michael Altman was a reference to Doom all along
[2:42:53] <MyNameIsRasus> i thought he stuck the sword in something
[2:43:02] <%ArchimerCXV> a respectful homage to a head of a company in a videogame? that's some high esteem.
[2:43:03] <%peachy996> OH GOD this is where the story turns for the worst
[2:43:12] <+TheBitingIrish> Didn't the sword break on the Icon of Sin?
[2:43:15] <ItIsSky> the hell dimension!
[2:43:22] <%ABakedDemon> The necromorphs are kinda like demons
[2:43:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chad davoth
[2:43:24] <+BusterRepukken> idk about turns to the worst
[2:43:35] <%dekkitout> First world problems, huh...
[2:43:38] <%Calliphor> Zenimax Altman was also the CEO of AdultFriendFinder for a while, hence why his name would be associated with a "Gentleman's Club"
[2:43:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> UN I SON
[2:43:40] <Theoyveyman> Why it go bad?
[2:43:51] <anuchallengertwitch> turns out Satan was God the whole time
[2:43:56] <Pookiedaexzile> ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW MR CRABS
[2:44:00] <MyNameIsRasus> MORALLY GRAY
[2:44:06] <+BusterRepukken> and we're going to kill him
[2:44:10] <Pookiedaexzile> in Doom Satan is GOD
[2:44:11] <+TheBitingIrish> Yeah, alright
[2:44:11] <Ner234> oh nooooo
[2:44:12] <%Deadpal> that makes perfect sense
[2:44:12] <%BoxNavy> godsatan
[2:44:18] <huskarl_zap> Alduin is Akatosh shit
[2:44:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Morally Gray ONLY if they show the cheeks
[2:44:23] <%Deadpal> that's consistent with god too
[2:44:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Lucifer is an Angel
[2:44:23] <bashful_bard> Morally grey Satan
[2:44:27] <%peachy996> So then who's the Father? Just some random Maykr Angel
[2:44:32] <user_naim> So let’s kill God-Satan
[2:44:33] <Pookiedaexzile> and God is a Woman Alien
[2:44:33] <%Puhff> but who was PHONE?!
[2:44:38] <%dekkitout> This is nearing Naruto Shippuden layers of retcons
[2:44:42] <%Burdenslo> @bashful_bard Satan’s hot
[2:44:44] <huskarl_zap> egg
[2:44:48] <%ArchimerCXV> @huskarl_zap alduin was one of his children tho?
[2:44:49] <%Deadpal> just some guy who overthrew god
[2:44:50] <%toastybites> like if the animals on the ark threw noah off the boat
[2:44:50] <lets_be_friendos> why wasn't that in the game instead of being relegated to a codex?
[2:44:51] <%Maids4lyfe> The Father is Davoth's creation
[2:44:51] <jorniev> DOPPIO WHAS HPONE!?
[2:44:58] <%Deadpal> who... the father is basically lucifer then?
[2:44:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Also Satan Looks like you
[2:45:03] <Pookiedaexzile> You look like God
[2:45:10] <%Deadpal> Lucifer if he succeeded ?
[2:45:12] <anuchallengertwitch> @peachy996  Father is the REAL Satanic archetype
[2:45:13] <samuelfisk> That’s lame
[2:45:15] <%Deadpal> nah
[2:45:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Cause
[2:45:18] <%RetroCop87> sATAN IS dOOM gUY'S nOBODY
[2:45:21] <%BoxNavy> because you are the satangodman
[2:45:21] <Theoyveyman> AI JESUS
[2:45:22] <MyNameIsRasus> is doomguy jesus
[2:45:23] <+LandOfTheWay> cause satan hasn't been around for a long time
[2:45:23] <%Deadpal> Satan chose your body cause "it's the deadliest thing around"
[2:45:24] <%peachy996> It's stupid
[2:45:25] <%Emperor_Machinus> Cause he was just a guy who was inmortal
[2:45:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Why does Ventus look like Roxas?
[2:45:31] <Ipsenscastle> they're gonna give doomguy some dumb secret origin i dont like :(
[2:45:33] <%ArchimerCXV> @PatStaresAt they made him look like you at the end of part 1 cause 'you're what they fear most'
[2:45:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> Sam Shrugs
[2:45:36] <anuchallengertwitch> @Deadpal  pretty much. Father is Lucifer if he overthrew god, and god became the devil
[2:45:37] <+BusterRepukken> Satan thought Doomguy was cool
[2:45:37] <MyNameIsRasus> oh my god
[2:45:37] <jorniev> maybe he thought doom man was the ultimate life form?
[2:45:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> Cause Doomguy is peak male body and performance Kappa
[2:45:38] <%peachy996> Hey speaking of Samur where'd he go?
[2:45:38] <Pookiedaexzile> JESUS
[2:45:40] <%Monkeyweed21> I always knew white people were the devil
[2:45:43] <+Delenay> satan 2 electric boogalloo
[2:45:44] <MyNameIsRasus> doom is kingdom hearts
[2:45:44] <+ALazo> the true satan was inside us all along
[2:45:48] <huskarl_zap> @archimercxv Yes but also the Atmorans called Akatosh Alduin in their animal pantheon
[2:45:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Satan: "Why can't my creations be immortal too? I sad when they die. Please help me, other creations." Some Asshole: "BETRAYAL"
[2:45:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Doom guy is Jesus/ Moses
[2:45:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> He did itnfor the LUL s
[2:45:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> @peachy996 Hyper Dead
[2:45:54] <%Xevtes> @CappuccinoGuil asking the real q's
[2:45:58] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> im calling a "there must always be a lich king" ending pat
[2:46:02] <Ipsenscastle> @Monkeyweed21 you figured us out oh no
[2:46:03] <%RetroCop87> "As for me? I'm already half Doom Guy"
[2:46:04] <%ABakedDemon> @peachy996 Didn't he die at then end of part 1?
[2:46:14] <%ShogunNoonto> it seem cool at the time
[2:46:20] <SatansDelight> Just enough lore cards to know everything and not cerail the fun of the game
[2:46:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @Xevtes I'm feeling like Nomura snuck into Id one day.
[2:46:23] <mesamus> no one knew how the dark lord looked in milions of years
[2:46:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> tbf nobody knew that doomguy looked like satan cause satan has been sealed for all eternity
[2:46:35] <%peachy996> Samur gets teleported away before you kill him, The Father "You don't need to kill him"
[2:46:37] <%toolofparanoia> Samur got teleported away by Father before the slayer could kill him
[2:46:37] <%ArchimerCXV> @huskarl_zap right, the more obscure knowledge instead of the upfront thing bethesda got to tell everyone, you do you
[2:46:38] <MyNameIsRasus> doom guy... IS LIGHT
[2:46:44] <Theoyveyman> So wait is John Doom not here because he was upset about his rabbit?
[2:46:45] <%BoxNavy> SICK
[2:46:55] <+Delenay> he is
[2:46:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Doomguy becoming the next world religion is prettt cool not gonna lie
[2:46:59] <anuchallengertwitch> @JusTTheGuyYouNeed  yeas that is something I forgot too
[2:47:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Doom guy only weighs 180 pounds
[2:47:11] <%the22cstomp> no he is mad because of rabbit
[2:47:12] <%ABakedDemon> Oohhh you're right, it's been a few months I forgot that's what happened
[2:47:15] <%TONYOO101> huh, didnt even know you can glroy kill those, always just headshot them for the instant kill
[2:47:18] <lets_be_friendos> @Theoyveyman in cut dialogue doomguy is from another universe where earth got destroyed
[2:47:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @MyNameIsRasus that is implied to have happened waaaaaay long ago.
[2:47:25] <%Burdenslo> @doc_ock_rokc that’s his dick weight
[2:47:25] <bashful_bard> John Doom is explicitly here bc he's pissed at Satan about hi rabbit
[2:47:37] <%BoxNavy> rip life
[2:47:39] <Meltgar> Apparently every demon got man to the prime demon that killed daisy going: "All this for that fucking rabbit" LUL
[2:47:43] <Meltgar> *mad
[2:47:45] <%RetroCop87> He tanked TWO!?
[2:47:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> same, forgot he got ported teehee~
[2:47:48] <anuchallengertwitch> @the22cstomp  he STARTED because he just happened to be on mars when they opened hell. He went back to kill demons because of daisy
[2:47:52] <%the22cstomp> did that fucker just eat 2 bfgs
[2:47:54] <%peachy996> Tanked 2 BFG shots like a boss
[2:47:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> it wasnt
[2:47:58] <MyNameIsRasus> @CappuccinoGuil what is?
[2:48:00] <$Dakuu75> wait, hol-up. did that fucker jsut take 2 BFG shots and NOT die???
[2:48:00] <Theoyveyman> So why Satan look like John?
[2:48:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> in which case, yeah, where the fuck DID he go?
[2:48:07] <%ArchimerCXV> the BFGs aint shit
[2:48:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Meltgar its like that one scene from john wick
[2:48:10] <%peachy996> Put that Baron in the Hall of Fame
[2:48:15] <%Monkeyweed21> So is John the demons or is the demons John?
[2:48:20] <pineapplepervert> And then John was the Satan
[2:48:20] <jorniev> I CAN
[2:48:26] <Ipsenscastle> man the BFG feels really underpowered now
[2:48:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> He doesnt afrid of anything
[2:48:33] <%holydeviant1> One BFG to clear the armor, two to eat the health pool, and a shotgun blast to actually kill holy shit
[2:48:37] <lets_be_friendos> the scrapped dialogue basically confirms the OG games take place in the “7th dimension"
[2:48:42] <%Maids4lyfe> JUMP
[2:48:42] <%barrakuta371> No Satan, you are the John Halo
[2:48:48] <bashful_bard> The bfg is just a room clear
[2:48:48] <jorniev> JOHN HALO WAS THE DEMON FOR THE COVENANT AFTER ALL
[2:48:50] <%toastybites> i mean doesnt the covenant think master chief is satan
[2:48:56] <%Ne1son> its is against anything thats not a heavy demon
[2:48:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @MyNameIsRasus the rabbit thing.
[2:49:00] <%Monkeyweed21> its a room clear
[2:49:01] <anuchallengertwitch> What about the unmakyr?
[2:49:11] <%the22cstomp> they think master chief is a demon but yeah same thing
[2:49:17] <thedw420> Wait, they’ve rebalanced the game since launch?
[2:49:18] <hakumaribo> wait what did they do to the bfg?
[2:49:21] <anuchallengertwitch> Is the unmakyr still good?
[2:49:26] <+Alaster101> Does Eternal have the option for the classic doom gun position like 2016?
[2:49:27] <%peachy996> Ammo would be more scarce in the entire DLC/Base Game as a result
[2:49:32] <Kadraxan> @PatStaresAt BFG power is mostly AoE from the tendrils, Unmaykr is more for single hard targets
[2:49:33] <%Maids4lyfe> Barons of Hell have always tanked BFGs
[2:49:37] <%muetank> De-powered it to make hammer and sword seem cooler in comparison
[2:49:39] <%TONYOO101> i think they made the balance so that bfg is for mob clearing and unmakyr for solo big guys
[2:49:41] <%Maids4lyfe> even original Doom
[2:49:42] <user_naim> They want you to actually play the game
[2:49:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> There are really good things, and REALLY bad things
[2:49:43] <+the22cstomp> it's a bunch of miniscule things adding up
[2:49:45] <pineapplepervert> Lore is off the rails
[2:49:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> And you cant access the Unmaykr in the dlc right?
[2:49:46] <$Dakuu75> that's some Plague of Gripes shit
[2:49:46] <%BoxNavy> they went in a weird direction for sure
[2:49:50] <+NeonLight> Doom is meant to be stressful, so theres room to be negative
[2:49:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @anuchallengertwitch Unmakyr is "Delete this fucking thing in particular" while BFG is "Delete almost everything"
[2:49:54] <BaronVonProlix> its why i much prefer 2016
[2:49:54] <bashful_bard> It's not perfect but it's still really fun
[2:49:54] <user_naim> @alaster101 i think so
[2:49:57] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i think its fine, it does kill anything that is not a heavy in one shot
[2:50:01] <%cvp5127> i like 2016 better
[2:50:02] <%BoxNavy> 2016 is a hard game to follow up
[2:50:04] <%Monkeyweed21> the minor issues stand out more
[2:50:07] <MyNameIsRasus> @CappuccinoGuil i think you tagged the wrong guy
[2:50:08] <%Maids4lyfe> @sonofthedeepsouth he still has unmakyr, pat just won't swap to it
[2:50:11] <penitentpendant> I prefer the plot pacing and game balance of 2016 over Doom Eternal, overall
[2:50:12] <+TheBitingIrish> Imagine thinking the BFG should ever be nerfed
[2:50:14] <Kadraxan> umaykr is totally available
[2:50:18] <MyNameIsRasus> but i do love the rabbit thing
[2:50:20] <%ArchimerCXV> when a game demands enough of you, you want a certain respect of it in return to be refined as possible, complaints come from enjoyment
[2:50:20] <Kadraxan> *unmaykr
[2:50:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @MyNameIsRasus lol maybe, sorry about that
[2:50:22] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat...
[2:50:22] <%BoxNavy> Perfume
[2:50:23] <anuchallengertwitch> @doc_ock_rokc  yeah. I think that can  be useful sometimes
[2:50:23] <Theoyveyman> Because Satan was originally God, that means you can STILL become Satanael & pillage him, right?
[2:50:24] <illtima> Are you having a stroke?
[2:50:25] <$RealThiele> purple gloop is still the worst idea
[2:50:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:50:27] <+Irridium> I honestly can't go back to 2016 that game's just too slow
[2:50:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt The closer to perfection something is the easier it is to see its flaws
[2:50:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> words
[2:50:30] <Pizzoots> i think the BFG nerf was good because in 2016 it trivializes every fight
[2:50:32] <garbageheaphound> Pat are you ok?
[2:50:32] <%the22cstomp> it feels way better than 2016 because you get to use all the weapons
[2:50:34] <BaronVonProlix> purfume it?
[2:50:35] <lets_be_friendos> playing 2016 after this is like playing Tales of Symphonia after Xillia 2
[2:50:37] <$Dakuu75> lol, WUT?!
[2:50:37] <%the22cstomp> instead of only needing 2
[2:50:38] <%BoxNavy> monkaS it would.
[2:50:40] <%dekkitout> It is?
[2:50:41] <+BusterRepukken> try going back to 2016 after this tho
[2:50:46] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:50:47] <garbageheaphound> Wait what?
[2:50:52] <+sixcubit> "is pat having a stroke?" i mean, usually
[2:50:53] <godzookylives> @PatStaresAt not for DSP
[2:50:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> are you serious?
[2:50:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> eyyy
[2:50:54] <+TheBitingIrish> Fucking Comcast
[2:50:54] <%BoxNavy> lame secret
[2:50:54] <ape_hawk> yeah, but you get off if your DSP
[2:50:55] <%Monkeyweed21> never stopped anyone before
[2:50:55] <syanplague> i mean the more you like something the more you think about it and the more easy to think and understand what bad about it
[2:50:57] <$RealThiele> buh fuh guh
[2:50:59] <BaronVonProlix> i do! regularly
[2:50:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> 4
[2:51:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> well, 3.5
[2:51:01] <%peachy996> @BusterRepukken Kind of afraid to
[2:51:03] <+BusterRepukken> 3 and a half kinda
[2:51:05] <+thechungiestofbois> wait... having a medical complication live on stream is a problem with TOS @PatStaresAt
[2:51:06] <mesamus> 3
[2:51:06] <+Irridium> 3 and a half
[2:51:07] <+OutLawMiller> 4
[2:51:07] <%peachy996> 3 and a Boss Level
[2:51:07] <anuchallengertwitch> 4
[2:51:08] <Ipsenscastle> he means stroking his penis, chat
[2:51:10] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> 3 and a boss
[2:51:17] <mesamus> 4 is boss
[2:51:18] <impulse255dj> 3 levels + boss fight which is seperated.
[2:51:18] <anuchallengertwitch> There's three levels and a boss level
[2:51:21] <%ABakedDemon> 3 and boss level
[2:51:22] <user_naim> 3 and BOSS
[2:51:23] <%BoxNavy> thats fine
[2:51:24] <pineapplepervert> You can literally "get off" on stream if you're DSP Kreygasm
[2:51:25] <+BusterRepukken> @peachy996 I did, and you miss so much.
[2:51:27] <%ABakedDemon> I think you can finish it
[2:51:27] <%Monkeyweed21> rip fortnite
[2:51:30] <$Dakuu75> don't tell me someone had a stroke on stream and twitch's response was so ban them
[2:51:33] <leothelion1001> Hi
[2:51:34] <%BoxNavy> im FUMING
[2:51:34] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> You can beat the game in like 3 or 4 hours

[2:51:53] <%dekkitout> Is Doomguy in the forkknife?
[2:51:55] <samuelfisk> The last is one extremely short.
[2:51:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pretty upset
[2:51:59] <bashful_bard> 2016 feels so basic after playing a ton of this. It makes me really interested to see where the combat goes with the next Doom
[2:52:09] <hakumaribo> why not kill the purple ones?
[2:52:09] <%peachy996> @BusterRepukken I imagine it's like going from Arkham City/Knight/Origins and then playing Asylum
[2:52:18] <leothelion1001> Hi Pat! Great game choice!
[2:52:19] <thepenguinprince> Wow. Not even a second to get your bearings. That's just rude

[2:53:02] <pth88> kenshi is so sick though
[2:53:02] <+BusterRepukken> @peachy996 Pretty much, there's just too many additions and too many QOL improvements in Eternal.
[2:53:09] <Theoyveyman> Shame about the Rise's ending
[2:53:09] <%Arancet> pat? modifying a schedule? what world is this?
[2:53:10] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> the six people that want to watch kenshi -- myself included -- are devastated
[2:53:11] <%BoxNavy> someones mad about that probably
[2:53:19] <anuchallengertwitch> Which Monster would work best as a fighting game character?
[2:53:20] <%Paperware> Do you plan on buying the PC port later this year too?
[2:53:20] <%GarbageNirvana> You heard him Capcom, crush that indie developer's dreams into the dust
[2:53:36] <%BoxNavy> OH GOD IT DOES
[2:53:36] <blackbookalpha> Brachy
[2:53:37] <+ALazo> would you want to stream it early? Already seen at least one person try that and get banned
[2:53:38] <$RealThiele> security station
[2:53:39] <%Daxalog> You say that every dlc
[2:53:42] <%BoxNavy> the second level
[2:53:43] <%peachy996> Looks just like him
[2:53:47] <pineapplepervert> throwback
[2:53:48] <%ArchimerCXV> yep, it's the UAC mars-esque design
[2:53:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @anuchallengertwitch HUNTING HORN
[2:53:53] <MyNameIsRasus> maybe up?
[2:53:58] <%ABakedDemon> It's because it a UAC facility
[2:53:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> it opens later
[2:53:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat should play morrowind actually Kappa
[2:53:59] <MyNameIsRasus> i dunno
[2:54:02] <+BusterRepukken> basically, you're going to load up 2016 and then immediately try to speed dash and can't and you'll be like oh...
[2:54:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its a monster to ME damn it
[2:54:05] <Ipsenscastle> Doom 2016 is a cool guy and doesnt afraid of anyone
[2:54:05] <Case_Ah_Dia> red key?
[2:54:06] <%ShadowFoxoon> Where's the vent entrance
[2:54:10] <lets_be_friendos> this dlc was rushed imo, they wanted to stick to the year one pass thing
[2:54:11] <impulse255dj> later
[2:54:12] <huskarl_zap> Hunting horn only run
[2:54:18] <%peachy996> Pat let me save you time and say this opens up after you do the room ahead

[3:00:38] <%thedw420> I agree
[3:00:42] <+TheBitingIrish> Can't FUCKING ANNIHILATE them if they aren't in the game
[3:00:44] <+BusterRepukken> like oh god i hate x monster hunter monster, i hope hes in rise
[3:00:45] <SatansDelight> Theyre the worst best chjallenge
[3:00:49] <anuchallengertwitch> Achviles are like Shadows in DMC 1
[3:01:00] <ChungusQuest> A worthy foe
[3:01:03] <syanplague> i mean there is not liking something but still apreciate what can it bring to the table
[3:01:11] <Theoyveyman> @patstaresat Did Pat ever fight Iceborne Fatalis? Cause that fight's awesome
[3:01:13] <anuchallengertwitch> or  Furies in DMC5
[3:01:14] <%ABakedDemon> Like Dual wielding elite ultras in halo 2 legendary lol well actually idk
[3:01:14] <Josef_Stryker> Any reason Pat is using the standard shotgun more than the Super Shotty?
[3:01:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Is Doomguy the ultimate Sigma Male
[3:01:28] <%Emperor_Machinus> @balthazar758 Now someone must edit Gief rising from the ocean and causing havok in Japan
[3:01:32] <huskarl_zap> yes
[3:01:36] <Theoyveyman> Aww
[3:01:36] <bashful_bard> Fuckin same
[3:01:38] <%BoxNavy> praying that hr shit is not in rise
[3:01:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt We need to kill fatty soon
[3:01:45] <lets_be_friendos> the best part about rise is cutscenes can be skipped
[3:01:51] <%Monkeyweed21> its really easy tho
[3:01:52] <%the22cstomp> playing world and then playing rise is such night and day, rise actually feels like a fun monster hunter game
[3:02:02] <$RealThiele> pass
[3:02:04] <%BoxNavy> @lets_be_friendos oh thank the lord
[3:02:06] <%AzureGale> Fuck and grind
[3:02:10] <OverlordedK> But hunting monsters is fun pat
[3:02:13] <tattleworm> mathematically impossible for you to not have the ranks and have accomplished both of those things
[3:02:17] <%Monkeyweed21> I got to MR 100 long before getting all the mantles I needed
[3:02:21] <%ArchimerCXV> the HR/MR grind in world is by far the worst part of it being release dlike a GaaS
[3:02:24] <+shaidot> Bump & Grind
[3:02:26] <%the22cstomp> i like grinding, but grinding monsters not ranks
[3:02:26] <lets_be_friendos> rise hype in japan is so huge that a CEO gave all his staff the day off for launch day
[3:02:27] <%peachy996> You could finish the DLC right now or save it for a short stream for later on
[3:02:28] <%Monkeyweed21> dont grind just have fun
[3:02:36] <elicoy> Thats where csb podcast comes in for the grind
[3:02:39] <$SGrim> I play monster hunter to hunt cool monsters
[3:02:40] <+MarlooRedd> how do you taint a prophecy?
[3:02:40] <%toastybites> @Monkeyweed21 the worst part is that some mantle upgrades are locked behind MR125
[3:02:41] <$RealThiele> reinserted tainted prophecy
[3:02:42] <%RetroCop87> The taint orifice
[3:02:42] <%arcielardor> oh god I got to that one kirin fight before Rajang and I just peaced out. couldn't take it anymore.
[3:02:44] <MyNameIsRasus> IT WAS ME AUSTIN
[3:02:47] <balthazar758> @Emperor_Machinus as elmo, his rival, tries to stop him. the lore grows deeper.
[3:02:48] <MyNameIsRasus> IT WAS ME ALL ALONG AUSTIN
[3:02:52] <%Monkeyweed21> THATS DUMB
[3:02:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dark Messiah hours
[3:03:01] <%BoxNavy> world was ultra grindy with the streamstones and the guiding lands shit
[3:03:02] <+BusterRepukken> its GREAT
[3:03:04] <%dekkitout> Makes a Jesus as an act of vengeance LUL
[3:03:09] <%peachy996> This is the best stopping point or you could finish it here.
[3:03:13] <$RealThiele> nanomachines
[3:03:14] <%ABakedDemon> Cool and dumb
[3:03:23] <samuelfisk> That’s lame

[3:03:33] <%maskofmichael> No, shut up and shoot demons
[3:03:34] <lets_be_friendos> just don't think about it :)
[3:03:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's when you make a complete collection of every weapon at the end of the tree, and every armor.
[3:03:40] <bashful_bard> Guiding Lands was just kinda dogshit by yourself
[3:03:40] <%Maids4lyfe> only the Father knows what Davoth looked like
[3:03:40] <%toastybites> maybe they're red green colorblind
[3:03:42] <%dekkitout> I'd have to dig through the vod, but iirc, then no, no one remembered
[3:03:43] <%cvp5127> shhhh

[3:04:36] <%peachy996> We doing it then
[3:04:37] <syanplague> i have to say it kind bother me that Doom 2016 was a game about "no lore" or "story is boring" to this thing with massive lore, it just feel like a contradiction

[3:26:04] <thepenguinprince> A pacific rim video game would be so cool
[3:26:04] <%JoshManVGH> No shit?
[3:26:09] <%Daxalog> He followed me on Twitter. Then unfollowed me years later
[3:26:21] <+Vampireinarm> @thepenguinprince there is one
[3:26:27] <user_naim> I love Hugo Martin
[3:26:38] <+ShutUpAceyP> remember when everyone was worried about how slow DOOM 2016 originally was?
[3:26:51] <%JoshManVGH> @vampireinarm Is it good?
[3:26:57] <blackbookalpha> Hugo did Gipsy's concept
[3:26:58] <%peachy996> You gotta max delay your jump and dashes for that one I think
[3:27:05] <godzookylives> @Daxalog Did you say Pacific Rim sucked or something?
[3:27:12] <$realm_forge> I hope bungie is paying attention because this is what an all out war  in a FPS is supposed to feel like
[3:27:24] <%Daxalog> No!
[3:27:27] <%peachy996> Or that lol
[3:27:31] <+TheBitingIrish> What was that gold thing?
[3:27:45] <Ultimatefool> Wait the purple poo is in the DLC too? Noooooo
[3:27:47] <+beetalogist> @TheBitingIrish refills 1 blood punch
[3:27:49] <%peachy996> That was a Blood Punch pick up
[3:27:52] <+Vampireinarm> @JoshManVGH they did a video on it in the old channel, its pretty much a 1v1 Jaeger vs Kaiju boxing style game? its pretty basic but its fun for what it is
[3:27:57] <+TheBitingIrish> Bungie ain't paying attention to anything
[3:28:17] <user_naim> I think I’m sitting on like 30 on my extra lives playthrough of the main game. It fills me with joy
[3:28:31] <scrumbotime> Jesus Christ remember when fighting ONE Pain Elemental was a huge deal and a tough fight?
[3:28:48] <blackbookalpha> I remember visiting id's office. 1:1 Doom Guy statue guards the lobby
[3:28:54] <%ABakedDemon> This is one crazy skyrim mod
[3:29:10] <%BoxNavy> Dragon.
[3:29:12] <%AzureGale> DRAGON
[3:29:13] <%holydeviant1> @blackbookalpha I like to imagine they have a button somwhere that wakes it up
[3:29:19] <%Monkeyweed21> DARGIN
[3:29:20] <%JoshManVGH> @vampireinarm Oh damn, i totally missed that one!
[3:29:21] <bashful_bard> Not really, pain elementals have been easy from day 1
[3:29:30] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I like it when the dragon did a Dragon
[3:29:41] <ape_hawk> did doom guy and mood guy bone each others buttholes yet?
[3:29:42] <balthazar758> dog! i mean, dragon!
[3:29:43] <blackbookalpha> @holydeviant1 nah that's for the Revenant carved out of wood using a chainsaw
[3:29:45] <MyNameIsRasus> more goo? this truly is hell
[3:29:45] <+BusterRepukken> id software said the more complaints they got about purple goo, the more they wanted to add it
[3:29:50] <Ultimatefool> Hype shit in the background

[3:32:08] <HeroToxiko> so, is the doomslayer a clone of the dark one or what
[3:32:08] <%holydeviant1> "You can't just shoot a hole in - ah, fuck it."
[3:32:17] <$realm_forge> I want a smartphone made out of Helltech
[3:32:23] <%toastybites> gotta kill that demon tesla
[3:32:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Palpy did it all
[3:32:33] <ape_hawk> i convinced you all to be stupid, and you fell for it
[3:32:34] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Doing satan things
[3:32:36] <%BoxNavy> yeah what if
[3:32:37] <+BusterRepukken> @HeroToxiko no, he got his powers from the dark lord putting doubts into the Maykrs minds
[3:32:46] <%peachy996> These guys are jobbers
[3:32:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Was that The Father trying to subvert the Dark Lord's plan then?
[3:32:57] <ape_hawk> unfodderable fodder
[3:33:02] <mr_saturday93> CAJSE THEY WEAK
[3:33:06] <%peachy996> Yeah and they die in one hit

[3:33:15] <%Daxalog> What?
[3:33:15] <+beetalogist> @GeneralSCPatton yes, in a nutshell

[3:33:17] <HeroToxiko> @BusterRepukken oh cool
[3:33:17] <impulse255dj> but they can be killed with flame beltch LUL
[3:33:18] <+BusterRepukken> these are doom 2016's multiplayer guys
[3:33:19] <$Dakuu75> rly?
[3:33:20] <%MugenSandan> "We didn't have the budget left to animate the glory kills on these guys"
[3:33:20] <huskarl_zap> asset reuse

[3:34:10] <lets_be_friendos> oh god this part
[3:34:10] <%arcielardor> they were riding dragons
[3:34:13] <%walternatorz> they got their own crossbows
[3:34:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> psaBig Annoying time
[3:34:15] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> oh this part
[3:34:18] <bashful_bard> Do it
[3:34:19] <trfurkanrey18> hugo martin moment
[3:34:19] <mr_saturday93> So the ruling elite as the weakest demons...
[3:34:21] <$realm_forge> This level is literally my subconscious
[3:34:24] <+beetalogist> to be fair, most of the demons probably started peacing out once the slayer yeeted himself through the wall
[3:34:25] <%holydeviant1> @ape_hawk I wonder if there's any really evil people who just happen to have an architecture degree
[3:34:27] <+BusterRepukken> now just run
[3:34:30] <$RealThiele> awooo
[3:34:40] <trfurkanrey18> buckio1Superpog supersphere
[3:34:44] <user_naim> oh no
[3:34:45] <+beetalogist> oh yeah the screechers respawn, being fodder :D
[3:34:45] <%BoxNavy> buffed the marauder :)
[3:34:46] <$RealThiele> goodboi
[3:34:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Did anyone else play a lot of DoomRL?
[3:34:59] <%Maids4lyfe> the screechers are infinite Pat
[3:34:59] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> they respawn
[3:35:01] <ape_hawk> OOPS ALL SCREECHERS
[3:35:01] <$RealThiele> LUL
[3:35:03] <%Maids4lyfe> stop killing them
[3:35:12] <%peachy996> Find that window
[3:35:13] <$RealThiele> way to buff all your enemies
[3:35:14] <+OmegaWeltall> the fodder is your ammo and health
[3:35:15] <%josstil> THERE IS NO MEME. DIE.
[3:35:18] <$realm_forge> Bad doggies become marauder fodder
[3:35:19] <+beetalogist> wait, it's all screechers? always has been.
[3:35:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> Worst room in the DLC PogChamp
[3:35:29] <user_naim> Oops all fuck you
[3:35:43] <$Dakuu75> OH SHIT , you have a way to de-shield them now?
[3:35:43] <%AyotoCorp> This room is the hardest fight in the DLC
[3:35:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Seems as if Pat fucked around and found out
[3:36:11] <zamzoph> I got through this part first try because one marauder got stuck running into a wall
[3:36:21] <%moonmintparadise> the music is really good here
[3:36:25] <bashful_bard> This room's honestly really funny
[3:36:36] <$RealThiele> awooo
[3:36:37] <trfurkanrey18> yeah this parts music is amazing
[3:36:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Why not kill purple dudes while Marauder is buffed?
[3:36:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> They respawn
[3:36:53] <%AyotoCorp> They infinitely spawn
[3:36:54] <%the22cstomp> they respawn
[3:37:05] <bashful_bard> Like no shit they're gonna troll the people that suck at killing marauders
[3:37:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Oooh I didn't catch that, gotcha
[3:37:18] <$realm_forge> ....they always come back....
[3:37:28] <%ABakedDemon> @PatStaresAt Next time you shoot the demonic soldiers shoot them with the rifle they just pop is pretty funny
[3:37:28] <+beetalogist> noice
[3:37:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> All downhill
[3:37:35] <%peachy996> Tricky room but the 7 lives remain
[3:37:46] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you basically just beat the game
[3:38:05] <lets_be_friendos> these guys LUL
[3:38:06] <$RealThiele> yeah yeah but where mecha tho
[3:38:08] <ChungusQuest> Now approaching the spooky apartment...WHERE THE DEVIL LIVES
[3:38:18] <%AyotoCorp> The mecha is in the cutscene
[3:38:24] <%cvp5127> booo
[3:38:27] <%peachy996> Samur got played by the Devil
[3:38:30] <%dekkitout> "It was me all along, Sora"
[3:38:30] <+TheBitingIrish> Are these supposed to be multiplayer bots from 2016?
[3:38:31] <zamzoph> Palpatine's behind it all!
[3:38:38] <+strifexfair> Pat, when are we gonna get you to play a final fantasy that's not FF14. would love your thoughts on other games in the series
[3:38:38] <$RealThiele> thanks sam
[3:38:45] <HeroToxiko> OOPS LUL
[3:38:45] <%moonmintparadise> oh hey that was the gladiator armor in that artwork
[3:38:47] <scrumbotime> The Divinity Machine was SUPPOSED to kill people?
[3:38:52] <jorniev> i hate that samuel hayden plot twist
[3:38:58] <bashful_bard> Those are the mp bots from 2016
[3:39:03] <HeroToxiko> i guess satan was just posessing him the whole time LUL
[3:39:03] <%peachy996> These enemies could die to the 2016 Pistol
[3:39:08] <+kullumanati> Pat is walking through his Factorio level
[3:39:17] <zamzoph> really Hayden was better off staying as robot man
[3:39:34] <+chaomera888> was lurking for a bit, yall seem like cool people :) just beat this tonight
[3:39:34] <huskarl_zap> yes
[3:39:35] <%ABakedDemon> @jorniev I agree after playing 2016 again it doesn't make a lot of sense. It's almost like it wasn't planned...
[3:39:43] <%moonmintparadise> wtf do they shoot dodgeballs ?
[3:39:59] <%the22cstomp> @strifexfair he's played 15, 7, 7r, and some of 12 on stream
[3:40:08] <$RealThiele> orbddemon
[3:40:21] <OverlordedK> magic pixel...
[3:40:43] <trfurkanrey18> shaver lookin ass control panel
[3:40:44] <%moonmintparadise> this feels like a classic doom level with a lot of enemies just in corridors instead of arenas
[3:40:51] <Pookiedaexzile> NICE
[3:40:54] <HeroToxiko> @jorniev the doomslayer lore makes it clear he had been in hell fo centuries killing demons but the samael stuff was only explained in key art
[3:41:04] <+LandOfTheWay> i do like that the mission objective is just "KILL THE DARK LORD"
[3:41:09] <+strifexfair> @the22cstomp thanks dude, i dont think i was around when he played those
[3:41:10] <scrumbotime> I like the idea that Samual Hayden was an unfortunately conveniently named guy who was dying of cancer, Then our Makyr Sam built a robot body and pretended to be him after he died of cancer.
[3:41:25] <%moonmintparadise> wow that was fast
[3:41:27] <HeroToxiko> key art you had top translate LUL
[3:41:28] <%AzureGale> CRITICAL DAMAGE
[3:41:39] <Pookiedaexzile> This even has  that same color scheme of old doom just remixed  in different amount's
[3:41:41] <garbageheaphound> its the weekly ones
[3:41:42] <+chaomera888> honestly just found out TODAY that swapping weapons to instantly shoot was not some weird speedrunning tech but actually intended game design, and honestly made me appreciate the game even more LUL
[3:41:44] <bashful_bard> They uh, they don't
[3:41:45] <%moonmintparadise> >Battlemode LUL
[3:41:46] <%Monkeyweed21> its for xp
[3:41:48] <%AzureGale> Yeah but the challenges don't really matter
[3:42:22] <%peachy996> too easy
[3:42:34] <%peachy996> Still fun though
[3:42:36] <OverlordedK> the 7 lives prolly help LUL
[3:42:38] <+TheBitingIrish> They nerfed the difficulty of p1

[3:58:10] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:58:10] <%BubbaRands> hehehehehe ye
[3:58:10] <%DashXero> The best bosses are just like you.
[3:58:11] <Hydrapissed> HE IS U

[3:58:12] <%solracc25> he got HP

[3:58:13] <+DarkDsion> yes
[3:58:13] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> yes he did

[3:58:16] <$slawson619> he can do everything you can do
[3:58:18] <%baka_sugoi> evo15MindBlown sbfpSetIn
[3:58:18] <%Emperor_Machinus> Battle of attrition?
[3:58:20] <%ABakedDemon> Honestly I would have liked this fight better if it doesn't tell you how to deal damage to him right away it's too easy
[3:58:20] <TheTakkster> Strap in boys
[3:58:21] <%josstil> Vergil?
[3:58:21] <%RaziWraith> No! Not the dogs! monkaS
[3:58:22] <+ShutUpAceyP> fight virgil?
[3:58:25] <Sarevic> Just like you
[3:58:25] <user_naim> health
[3:58:27] <+GrandmasterBFunk> holy shit that's a video game ass effect
[3:58:27] <+griffball13> chaingun is best
[3:58:28] <%JoshManVGH> He is you after a sense...
[3:58:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @DashXero people cant figure out how to fight marauders even with tutorial popupo
[3:58:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kinda
[3:58:30] <$realm_forge> WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME BITCH
[3:58:32] <mike2hands> still it is lame that give you hints to the last boss by default
[3:58:33] <comicalmond9135> oh ya he gonna take all your health
[3:58:33] <%peachy996> So basically he demands your reactions are on point
[3:58:35] <blackbookalpha> use gat when he's stunned
[3:58:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> MORE DPS
[3:58:39] <huskarl_zap> Owl fight two Doom Eternal
[3:58:43] <%Piemono> Those fucking video arcade noises when you stun him man\
[3:58:43] <Balay123> Use the minigun Pat, the tutorial already gave you the hint
[3:58:45] <OverlordedK> I like the whole health split mechanic
[3:58:45] <jorniev> whats with this music?
[3:58:50] <huskarl_zap> God can get dizzy?
[3:58:52] <blackbookalpha> ye ye ye
[3:58:58] <$Afterman_> @Balay123 he just did lol
[3:58:59] <Hydrapissed> he Healed lol
[3:59:01] <$Dakuu75> 2 men enter, 1 man leaves! TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN LEAVES~!
[3:59:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> HE JUST GOT HEALTH BACK
[3:59:04] <scrumbotime> Oooh, his shoulder guns are like your grenades
[3:59:11] <superchunk121> Balls kekw
[3:59:14] <Brandon__Brando> that stun sound is such a video game sound I love it
[3:59:19] <%Arancet> theres something wrong about mecha satan having a goofy dazed stance with stars above his head
[3:59:20] <+ShutUpAceyP> oh he heals huh?
[3:59:21] <Balay123> @Afterman_ He did as I sent it
[3:59:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> welp
[3:59:26] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt pro tip if you shot him when he is not green he gets a massive heal
[3:59:27] <Theoyveyman> OH GOD
[3:59:27] <%baka_sugoi> that heath tho
[3:59:28] <trfurkanrey18> it really is bullshit how when you hit him when he isnt blinking he just gets healed
[3:59:32] <nevan_44> oof
[3:59:34] <%AzureGale> Yeah, I can see this fight is going to SUCK
[3:59:38] <$Afterman_> @Balay123 ur telepathic and telekinetic
[3:59:40] <jorniev> the stun stars kinda look silly
[3:59:41] <Sapphire_Breeze> this boss is kind of lame
[3:59:43] <Ravioli_Ronin> Dig up, satan
[3:59:48] <mike2hands> this song needs more metal
[3:59:54] <Theoyveyman> NICE
[3:59:56] <%peachy996> The Zombies are good for Ammo Refill, Glory Kill when you need the Hammer immediately and panic health
[3:59:57] <%Nekros4442> I assume this is just phase 1 guys lol
[3:59:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Glory kill the fodder to recharge hammer
[4:00:01] <jorniev> this song is too slow
[4:00:03] <OtterSlinger> Do the stun stars show up on grenade falters and the like?
[4:00:04] <%dekkitout> Do combo
[4:00:05] <+kullumanati> Better than the ADdD a thin of part 1 final. Oss
[4:00:06] <$Afterman_> melty melty
[4:00:17] <%baka_sugoi> F O O T S I E S
[4:00:19] <trfurkanrey18> the song gets faster its actually pretty good
[4:00:19] <%Fooguwu> waiting for my covid test results, wish me luck chat
[4:00:21] <+beetalogist> @Nekros4442 yeah check out the blue pips above the boss's health bar
[4:00:34] <$Afterman_> this fight is basically giovana from strive
[4:00:47] <trfurkanrey18> hope its negative dude but regardless you can overcome it @Fooguwu
[4:00:49] <impulse255dj> good luck @Fooguwu
[4:00:50] <%peachy996> True, while this is a weird boss for THE final Boss. It's not as bad as Samur
[4:00:51] <%dekkitout> Now for phase 2/5 psaSkelmo
[4:00:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> showery
[4:00:55] <huskarl_zap> If only the game had more indepth  close combat other than sword being a different looking bfg
[4:00:55] <+griffball13> CHARGING STAR
[4:01:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> why have TUTORIALS mid fight
[4:01:02] <jorniev> WHY ARE YOU TUTORIALIZING THE BOSS FIGHT
[4:01:06] <Sparda_blizzard> this tutorial popup is kinda lame
[4:01:07] <+LandOfTheWay> this fight is fine, but the tutorial messages are really not needed
[4:01:10] <Ventuss> shield to the face
[4:01:14] <jorniev> THATS THE WORST
[4:01:14] <comicalmond9135> SHIELD SLASH
[4:01:16] <DSD24> Love how we are still doing these
[4:01:18] <$slawson619> is this the final boss or the first tutorial KappaHD MiniK KappaHD
[4:01:18] <%Nekros4442> Cus people complained too much about Part 1 I assume
[4:01:19] <%maskofmichael> @dekkitout More like phase 2/666
[4:01:19] <Hydrapissed> eternal has always had tutorials on everything
[4:01:20] <Balay123> Remind me why Pat uses a controller again
[4:01:22] <%peachy996> Dodge to the side
[4:01:23] <huskarl_zap> Also wasn't the unmayker supposed to be super important
[4:01:24] <%the22cstomp> STARS AND STRIPES
[4:01:26] <$Dakuu75> burn to the ground!, burn to the ground!, BURN BURN BURN BURN, BURN TO THE GROUND
[4:01:29] <OtterSlinger> Am I the only one who thinks Doom 2016 has better boss fights than Eternal
[4:01:29] <+ShutUpAceyP> make it to the final boss? here's a tutorial on how to beat him.
[4:01:32] <$Afterman_> jesus
[4:01:45] <%AzureGale> FINAL... JUSTICE
[4:01:49] <%moonmintparadise> he has grenades too haha
[4:01:51] <+griffball13> this is some footsies
[4:01:51] <%ABakedDemon> @ShutUpAceyP Right I don't like that it's too easy
[4:01:54] <jorniev> AGAIN SONG TOO SLOW
[4:02:01] <%peachy996> The 3 Boss Fights in 2016 are okay
[4:02:07] <+ManimalCrackerss> isnt this guy a vergil or something
[4:02:07] <$Afterman_> he do his best
[4:02:13] <pineapplepervert> this fight is badly designed
[4:02:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @shutupaceyp Not having those tutorials would be fine if you kept your extra lives when reverting to checkpoint.
[4:02:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @OtterSlinger did you forget how nothing Spider Mastermind was
[4:02:24] <trfurkanrey18> yeah wish he was a vergil
[4:02:29] <$Afterman_> oh my god does this dude have 4 pips total
[4:02:43] <DSD24> Isn't it 5 pips?
[4:02:49] <user_naim> They don’t want the player to have to figure out the basics.
[4:02:53] <BurdRightsActivist> The MEGA MURADER
[4:02:54] <OtterSlinger> @Monkeyweed21 Fit that game better than this does Eternal
[4:02:54] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> he has 5
[4:02:55] <$Afterman_> @DSD24 one is gone already
[4:03:07] <user_naim> Only the advanced stuff and how to actually do it
[4:03:07] <impulse255dj> @OtterSlinger no not just you. Doom Eternal's bosses are nothing to write home about. And the Dark Lord is probably the worst.
[4:03:08] <$Afterman_> i meant left, not total total, sorry
[4:03:15] <+Teais4cups> this entire fight is just waiting for him to do a specific attack and don't get hit its sooo lame
[4:03:19] <jorniev> i forgot how video gamey this game was
[4:03:20] <DSD24> @Afterman_ Its all good man!
[4:03:26] <$Dakuu75> this mother fucker, do evil-satan, charging stars lol
[4:03:27] <Balay123> Stop using the Flame Belch on him, it hasn't worked the first 3 times lmao
[4:03:27] <%peachy996> I dunno I think Khan Maykr is worse than this
[4:03:35] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i love doom eternal, but all the bosses kinda suck
[4:03:41] <jorniev> that super arcade noise from the stun... i do not care for it
[4:03:43] <$Afterman_> this fight looks like how you gotta play sekrio bosses... forcing the AI to do certain actions so you get hit them
[4:03:46] <%Lion_kun> boy it sure is fun waiting for a boss to do a specific attack before shooting
[4:03:52] <$Afterman_> get to hit them*
[4:03:53] <%peachy996> Icon of Sin is kind of a similar thought process to this fight
[4:03:54] <OtterSlinger> Has there ever been a TRULY amazing FPS boss fight?
[4:04:02] <%Lion_kun> I mean back in the day, shooting it till it was dead was good enough
[4:04:04] <%Arancet> this seems fine for *A* boss, but weak for the FINAL boss
[4:04:04] <OtterSlinger> I'm genuinely asking I want to know
[4:04:05] <Balay123> That shield charge is kinda bull
[4:04:15] <%peachy996> The Icon of Sin requires you to master the Sword, this requires the Hammer
[4:04:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Too reliant on the hammer for the summons
[4:04:16] <%ABakedDemon> Pat you have beaten every dar souls you got this
[4:04:22] <OverlordedK> shield charge is jsut dodge left/right
[4:04:23] <Theoyveyman> The wolf howls surely won't run thin anytime soon...
[4:04:24] <trfurkanrey18> @OtterSlinger  Gladiator from the base game
[4:04:30] <samuelfisk> What do you all think of 2016 Cyberdemon?
[4:04:30] <+beetalogist> yeah it is
[4:04:31] <jorniev> i hate those wolves
[4:04:31] <$Afterman_> when is he gonna pull out his shoulder mounted minigun?
[4:04:32] <$Dakuu75> can... can you hit his grenade back at him?
[4:04:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Shield bash is a pain
[4:04:41] <DSD24> Do you think these zombies want the dark lord to lose so that's why they are showing up?
[4:04:42] <impulse255dj> Id Software: "Hey guys, lets make a Dark Souls boss and then remove any pattern from the fight."
[4:04:43] <+Ninjamaninjas> I wish he had to manage his ammo too, so you'd both be fighting over killing fodder
[4:04:45] <%Monkeyweed21> stop running into him
[4:04:50] <DSD24> @samuelfisk I loved that fight!
[4:04:55] <OtterSlinger> @trfurkanrey18 He wasn't that great, at least that's how I feel
[4:04:55] <user_naim> Side double doge worked for me
[4:04:56] <%Lion_kun> truly a great idea for a doom boss fight, not shooting
[4:04:58] <%peachy996> 2016 Cyberdemon was alright.
[4:04:58] <Balay123> @Dakuu75 Nah
[4:04:59] <Theoyveyman> WOOOOOOOOO
[4:05:01] <jorniev> that stun noise is so annying to me
[4:05:02] <%ABakedDemon> I liked the cyberdemon fight it was just easy, should've had more phases
[4:05:17] <%Fooguwu> why is satan a robot
[4:05:19] <+ThemDubs> walks straight into it
[4:05:21] <Ventuss> why make the most disliked enemy a boss fight
[4:05:22] <+ShutUpAceyP> alright. now fight the boss without getting hit once
[4:05:32] <jorniev> WOOOOOOOOO
[4:05:35] <%peachy996> The Slug fight wasn't bad either
[4:05:36] <$Afterman_> can you really only hit him when he is green? what about when he is exposed during an animation? does he block it?
[4:05:38] <+TheBitingIrish> Satan is IN the robot @Fooguwu
[4:05:40] <$realm_forge> PAT YOU SURVIVED HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL THIS IS NOTHING
[4:05:41] <trfurkanrey18> @OtterSlinger  each their own man can see it but it got me with the music yelling rip and tear
[4:05:44] <Theoyveyman> WOOOOOOO
[4:05:44] <%AzureGale> "Hey, how can we make this boss complete bullshit? Let's give him health draining properties!"
[4:05:45] <+griffball13> you are too far away
[4:05:52] <trfurkanrey18> fight itself was great too
[4:05:57] <impulse255dj> @Ventuss because Hugo Martin LOVES the Marauder.
[4:05:57] <jorniev> man this fight seems really cool, but im just NOT FEELING IT
[4:05:58] <+Breaknoon> the sfx bro
[4:05:59] <+Teais4cups> this fight alone killed the entire dlc for me it's such a lame fight
[4:06:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @Ventuss marauder works as a boss not a regular enemy
[4:06:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Keeps getting baited into hammering right before the opening
[4:06:06] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt shooting the grenades really helps as well
[4:06:11] <%Fooguwu> @TheBitingIrish satan sounds like a little babby bitch boi
[4:06:11] <%peachy996> I can't really say any of the boss fights in either Doom game are legit bad. Some of them are just better/worse than others
[4:06:21] <DSD24> I actually think that he gets health drain is cool
[4:06:27] <ChungusQuest> The Dark Lord: "I'm sending you home, Boy. Now."
[4:06:38] <$Afterman_> nice
[4:06:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> I feel like the chaingun shield would have a lot of value here
[4:06:46] <%baka_sugoi> 3
[4:06:53] <jorniev> I DONT CARE FIGHT
[4:06:53] <%solracc25> Cool
[4:06:59] <%Lion_kun> Doom 2016 bosses are easily far better than Eternal
[4:07:00] <jorniev> WHY ARE WE TALKING
[4:07:01] <+Breaknoon> defeat Warhammer man
[4:07:03] <$Afterman_> in before his devil suit is actually HOLDING HIS POWER BACK
[4:07:07] <$realm_forge> Good. You beat the tutorial
[4:07:08] <+griffball13> I WAS GOD ALL ALONG IDIOT
[4:07:09] <DSD24> Stop talking with the mask off
[4:07:12] <%AzureGale> I AM YOUR FATHER
[4:07:13] <%peachy996> Yes we know
[4:07:18] <%dekkitout> Is this dialogue for the ones in the back who weren't listening?
[4:07:20] <%solracc25> Show abs cowrd
[4:07:21] <DSD24> You look cooler with the Mask on
[4:07:22] <%peachy996> But who are you Father
[4:07:22] <%JoshManVGH> Man, boss fights in video games just universally suck, huh!?
[4:07:25] <jorniev> still killing you
[4:07:25] <+BusterRepukken> yes
[4:07:28] <xbb1024> He has to tell you cause lots of people don't read
[4:07:29] <BurdRightsActivist> MARTHA
[4:07:33] <Tracazoid> "I am your creator." "So?" *cocks shotgun*
[4:07:38] <+ShutUpAceyP> so god is stan and satan is god?
[4:07:42] <%Monkeyweed21> he's looking for a shot
[4:07:42] <$Afterman_> @JoshManVGH depends on the game/genre
[4:07:44] <Balay123> @BurdRightsActivist WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME
[4:07:46] <star_feline> Dont care die now
[4:07:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Satan is GOD?!!
[4:07:50] <Hydrapissed> the point lol
[4:07:54] <blackbookalpha> Papa John's Reckoning
[4:07:54] <Hydrapissed> hes just gana shoot u
[4:07:58] <Theoyveyman> WHY ISN'T HE A COOL MONSTER? WHY'S HE JUST A DUDE IN A ROBOT SUIT?
[4:07:58] <+griffball13> here we go boys
[4:07:59] <balthazar758> just kill them all doomguy
[4:07:59] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt Woody from kingdom hearts 3!!!
[4:07:59] <+BusterRepukken> Satan is way cooler than God
[4:08:00] <BurdRightsActivist> SAVE MARTHA
[4:08:00] <DSD24> New area!
[4:08:00] <$RealThiele> who is your daddy, and what does he do?
[4:08:04] <pineapplepervert> spyro bossfight looking ass
[4:08:05] <jorniev> WOOOOOOOOOLVES
[4:08:07] <samuelfisk> This is lame.
[4:08:07] <huskarl_zap> How can god die?
[4:08:07] <+Cobaltor_252> Doomguy's just like "I gotta kill the biggest demon"
[4:08:08] <%dekkitout> Dante? No wait, he'd be irreverent...
[4:08:08] <corepercentlives> me
[4:08:08] <$Dakuu75> satan was god but then he got his throne stolen?
[4:08:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> Welcome to the ACTUAL fight
[4:08:10] <%ABakedDemon> Right he is just waiting for him to shut up so he can kill him
[4:08:10] <Theoyveyman> WOOOOO
[4:08:11] <trfurkanrey18> catJAM
[4:08:13] <OtterSlinger> God Satan? Lucyhvh?
[4:08:14] <%baka_sugoi> WE ANIME NOW PogChamp
[4:08:17] <%peachy996> This is where the fight gets spicy but the Hammer still makes it a cakewalk once you prioritize
[4:08:20] <Pizzoots> NOT WRONG LUL
[4:08:24] <$Afterman_> 100% woody from KH3
[4:08:39] <%TheBensonator_> “Whatever, imma rip and tear some more now” - Doomguy, literaly
[4:08:42] <OverlordedK> I spent most of this phase doing laps getting glory gills on fodder to recharge hammer LUL
[4:08:43] <jorniev> still not feeling the music
[4:08:47] <%thedw420> I miss when doom guy didn’t care about the story
[4:08:50] <mr_saturday93> @afterman_ bullshit really?
[4:08:53] <$RealThiele> thats def the 2016 to eternal difference is the change from metal to anime
[4:09:01] <$Dakuu75> does pat have any BFG ammo?
[4:09:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> He STILL doesn't care
[4:09:14] <$Afterman_> @mr_saturday93 what sounds so bs about it
[4:09:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> Doomguy is Rage
[4:09:15] <HeroToxiko> satangod was just explaining why he has to kill doomguy and dg was just standing there reloading LUL
[4:09:20] <huskarl_zap> Spine penis eyes
[4:09:21] <pineapplepervert> not anime, just generic fantasy
[4:09:30] <OtterSlinger> Less tough, more tedious
[4:09:34] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea
[4:09:43] <%AzureGale> Has this fool even done a green flash slash yet
[4:09:43] <mr_saturday93> @afterman_ just disbelief
[4:09:48] <jorniev> WOOOOLVES
[4:09:55] <$RealThiele> some say the dark lord has received the blessing of all 4 chaos gods
[4:09:57] <$Afterman_> @mr_saturday93 have you never seen the kh3 scene with woody??
[4:09:59] <pineapplepervert> aesthetic and lore of doom eternal is absolute dogshit, and those dlc made it even worse
[4:10:05] <%peachy996> You can leave that Hell Knight alone when he summons
[4:10:07] <pineapplepervert> less is more
[4:10:10] <Theoyveyman> Also these arena borders just look goofy. Like TP Ganondorf fight.
[4:10:14] <mr_saturday93> @afterman_ I did
[4:10:15] <+BusterRepukken> man theres some salty in this chat lol
[4:10:15] <bashful_bard> That's a good strat
[4:10:17] <jorniev> GOD I HATE THOSE WOLVES
[4:10:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> i love a boss that works on the same mechanics you do
[4:10:29] <$Afterman_> @mr_saturday93 oh ok, lol. just checking
[4:10:36] <pineapplepervert> this game is so "silly" and "in your face", it feels like they cater to underage redditors
[4:10:43] <mr_saturday93> @afterman_ I thought you meant that he is voiced by the guy who voiced woody in kh3
[4:10:51] <$Dakuu75> I'm worried it might be spoilers to guess... But, i keep thinking slayer is gonna stab him with his own sword.
[4:10:53] <Jmann1892> Does no one know what doom guy's motivation is? Like he doesn't care about your bs his bunny is dead
[4:10:54] <Pookiedaexzile> I just realized.... Doom Slayer is so bad ass God has to fight him in a mech
[4:10:58] <CoffeeSlice> EY
[4:10:59] <%AzureGale> Noice
[4:11:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Like he's a fucking Kaju
[4:11:02] <bashful_bard> Oh nice

[4:11:07] <+BusterRepukken> >redditors
[4:11:08] <$Afterman_> @mr_saturday93 oh no no no lol. it was in reference to finding a character who gave less of a fuck.
[4:11:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainPileDriver subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! fuck yeah 49 months, question, is your love for paige like diarrhea cause you just can't hold it in anymore?
[4:11:13] <huskarl_zap> I wouldn't mind anything else if the gameplay was just a sequel to the last game
[4:11:13] <+ShutUpAceyP> it should be a cage match
[4:11:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> we take does
[4:11:19] <trfurkanrey18> @Jmann1892 protecting mankind

[4:13:25] <$Afterman_> yes you do
[4:13:30] <+griffball13> hit the boss and don't get hit.
[4:13:33] <$masneo2> dusk is amazing
[4:13:34] <%Lion_kun> this isn't even fun, it's stupidly tedious
[4:13:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> First Person Souls?
[4:13:35] <+CherteuseKapibara> 2 more
[4:13:38] <%AzureGale> This boss fight would be rad were it not for the life drain
[4:13:39] <$Afterman_> just do it better..
[4:13:39] <+ShutUpAceyP> now he's gotta do it 2 more times
[4:13:42] <jorniev> yeah he shot him in the dic!
[4:13:43] <Mattais88> This is going to end up like P5 isn't it? Shooting God in the face while he deathbed monologues
[4:13:45] <OtterSlinger> This is slightly less tedious with weapon switch combos, as cheesy as those might seem
[4:13:46] <$slawson619> if you beat the last boss first try I'm going to be salt bossla9FS brucegNodeaths
[4:13:48] <huskarl_zap> Shoot the boss until it dies

[4:20:36] <%TheBensonator_> Thank the PEE-po
[4:20:37] <spoony_667> hey can someone here eat my shorts
[4:20:37] <HeroToxiko> remember when ubisoft credits were unskippable LUL that was genuinely awful
[4:20:39] <+Ninjamaninjas> The next reboot
[4:20:44] <%peachy996> I dunno. It's still fun just not as good as TAG1 Pre-Nerf. Also the amount of easing you in they do for players is almost patronizing
[4:20:45] <+BusterRepukken> the Ultra Nightmare skin looks awesome for this DLC
[4:20:47] <$jaxondorf> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead
[4:20:48] <%tusk102> @thelonechris Doom 3: Not the other one
[4:20:54] <+TheBitingIrish> @thelonechris In another 15-20 years for Doom 3-2
[4:21:02] <+ShutUpAceyP> Now it's Paige's turn to fight Stan
[4:21:12] <Sarevic> Might risk it all for the TAG2 UN skin
[4:21:24] <user_naim> Can’t wait for the next universe Doomguy falls into in like 2029
[4:21:44] <+BusterRepukken> the TAG2 UN skin is literally the Ultra Nightmare symbol, its sick.
[4:21:53] <%tusk102> @user_naim Wolfenstein Doom splitscreen multiplayer game when
[4:22:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Since Christianity is mostly tapped out, ya think the sequel might go for metal Lovecraft?
[4:22:13] <+BusterRepukken> Quake reboot next pls
[4:22:16] <+Carquar> Now how about a Quake or Hexen reboot?
[4:22:25] <user_naim> @tusk102 Oh yeah, we could let doomguy handle the space nazis
[4:22:30] <+Ninjamaninjas> Doom 4: You wanted more? Doom 5: Just try and stay alive Doom 6: Punching Demon Dix
[4:22:31] <+BusterRepukken> Quake Champions doesnt count
[4:22:43] <+TheBitingIrish> Shame New Colossus sucked
[4:22:43] <%peachy996> Or next time John is actually the demons
[4:22:52] <%tusk102> @user_naim "Why should i kill these guys" "they're demons"
[4:22:56] <%PanicSwytch> RELOAD
[4:22:57] <%AzureGale> Doom 7: Intergrade
[4:23:05] <+TheBitingIrish> KEK
[4:23:18] <+BusterRepukken> Doom 7: Intergrade, Sephiroth just gets decapitated.
[4:23:27] <%tusk102> question what is the dance pat and paige doing from i know i've seen it somewhere
[4:23:31] <+Ninjamaninjas> Doom 7: Remake Intergrade
[4:23:38] <%whyskeywolfe> whyskeywolfe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Maybe I'm just a tired old Irish cynic, but the thought of doing that final boss any times more than once seems like some quare aul bollocks, so it does.
[4:23:44] <blackbookalpha> now with more belts
[4:23:50] <Mattais88> Doom 358/2 Decades
[4:23:56] <Theoyveyman> DOOM: EVER CRISIS
[4:23:57] <balthazar758> ReDOOM
[4:24:01] <+Carquar> Why not another reboot, but it's slow and tactical. Doom: Metal. Music by Sleep
[4:24:02] <@SoFarFetched> @tusk102 its the dance from pop team epic like this DJ scene is from
[4:24:06] <%peachy996> I'd rather do that Satan fight again than the Samur fight
[4:24:14] <Theoyveyman> DOOM: THE FIRST NIGHT SENTINEL
[4:24:20] <%tusk102> @SoFarFetched THANKS i couldn't remember
[4:24:21] <$KnivesEve> DOOM: Dirge of Cerberus
[4:24:21] <%peachy996> Samur fight is probably the most annoying
[4:24:39] <%AzureGale> Doom 8: Doom Slayer Takes Manhattan
[4:24:41] <impulse255dj> @whyskeywolfe I hear ya, shite craic so it is.
[4:24:52] <samuelfisk> @peach996 I hope they can do better than that.

[4:25:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[4:25:32] <%AzureGale> Doom 9: Halo 6
[4:25:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> With the Dark Lord dead and the Father permanently diminished, that leaves plenty of room for eldritch anti-reality bullshit to creep in mostly unopposed
[4:25:33] <%DashXero> Yeah.
[4:25:34] <+TheBitingIrish> NotLikeThis
