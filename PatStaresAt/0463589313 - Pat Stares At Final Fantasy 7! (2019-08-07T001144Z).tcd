[0:13:00] <%SirGO0SE> from my past experience with Fire Emblem games, I usually don't put them down until a new one comes out

[0:14:15] <%RubberFistFight> @Sphincter_Spelunker Man, I havent played in months. BfA fucking killed any desire I had to play it, and from what I can gather it's only gotten worse since launch.
[0:14:25] <+MutedOnTwitter> That little animation of Pat swinging his. arms and then flipping the bird is gr8.

[0:15:25] <%Kenori> The cool thing with destiny is that theres not really any activity that you can do that is too low for you. Most everything you can play is gonna be your level
[0:15:27] <+cvp5127> too late
[0:15:28] <%foreverN2dust> all is fair in love and pur

[0:28:00] <InugamiTheHound> David Hayter was mad at Evo for using his voice same with Konami as well.
[0:28:07] <alrobot2014> why is goons such a fun word
[0:28:12] <+d00msdaydan> tbh if you're gonna start over wait until new light, it'll have the old russia tutorial from d1
[0:28:18] <%Kashi_Nin> goons IS a fantastic word
[0:28:19] <%cureneckbeard> Well, you know what they say. Hayter's gonna hate.
[0:28:27] <%happyface699> Found it
[0:28:30] <%PipIV> why dont people ever use "Goon" anymore. great comic by the by
[0:28:42] <$afronooch> yeah
[0:28:44] <+d00msdaydan> not the zone, just the tutorial level
[0:28:45] <%nmaten> i love when pat thanks the person then gets visibly confused by their message
[0:28:47] <%Kashi_Nin> oh man
[0:28:49] <chambatron> Not D1
[0:28:50] <%happyface699> @pipiv Goon was a fucking great word
[0:28:51] <+d00msdaydan> you play the old tutorial and then the homecoming mission
[0:28:54] <+MutedOnTwitter> I poured cool ranch all over my motherboard and put RAM in my salad, and I don't know where I screwed up.
[0:29:16] <chambatron> Like not D1 russia. We're getting D1 moon tho
[0:29:18] <%SirGO0SE> @MutedOnTwitter are watercooling with mountain dew?
[0:29:21] <%PipIV> Goon was pretty WIZARD.
[0:29:23] <%happyface699> Ranch it up
[0:29:28] <%Kashi_Nin> I WISH we could get all the D1 zones back at least in some fashion

[0:30:28] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> sonicfox is the only good gamer
[0:30:32] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Then Seth cried at the end of another Top 8 commentary. Love him
[0:30:39] <+Austinck> Randy is a bully

[0:31:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> nice
[0:31:07] <%cureneckbeard> pat you need to spend another half an hour reading scubibers
[0:31:07] <natebud> These some good names
[0:31:07] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I just joined. Where is the Mustard Queen and Hair Baby?
[0:31:09] <alrobot2014> do we have a physical representation of [Bring Me To Life] ?
[0:31:09] <%Kashi_Nin> All of these tracks give me the goosbumps to this day
[0:31:09] <Baconrath> & Knuckles
[0:31:11] <$MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:31:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think you mean Clumbo. Who is this Cloud fellow?
[0:31:18] <+asgard147> limesD
[0:31:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Please tell me there’s more cross dressing
[0:31:19] <%PipIV> High in vitamin "D"
[0:31:21] <%manwithboxonhead> Ass4dayz yea...
[0:31:23] <mojokingizakku> hey, it's ol' Clumbo and company
[0:31:25] <disflipmat> They're gonna drop the plate on Sector 7
[0:31:26] <+Austinck> you mean Clumbo
[0:31:28] <moosemonkey397> This gonna be an interesting part in the remake
[0:31:31] <$MajorCrasher> fuck his mouth?! LUL
[0:31:31] <%Gogogolem> I forgot his name was Clumbo
[0:31:33] <@lewdskeletor13> We also did big terrorisms
[0:31:38] <%Owkono> if you see a horse man steal from him
[0:31:41] <%Kashi_Nin> Clumbo, Knuckles, Ass4Dayz, Squall
[0:31:43] <%cureneckbeard> nyannSleepy
[0:31:43] <%happyface699> Awwwww
[0:31:44] <bendatron> ASS4DAYZ
[0:31:47] <%Kashi_Nin> (eventually)
[0:31:51] <natebud> Go throw a phoenix down on Elmo
[0:31:52] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> They're gonna drop that thun thun thun on Sector 7.
[0:31:58] <Ion_Laser> Gonna fight the system by blowing shit up
[0:32:02] <%starotter70> AVALANCHE!
[0:32:03] <MetroidSlayerP7> Big terrorism
[0:32:08] <%Frost_Quill> Clumbo, Chewie, Ass4Dayz. & Knuckles.
[0:32:09] <%PipIV> sometimes you gotta drop a section of the city on top of another section of a city to make an omelet
[0:32:09] <%Kashi_Nin> @NoHoldsBarredProductions oh no lol
[0:32:14] <%happyface699> Big terror
[0:32:15] <%Gogogolem> Clumbo is a terrible terroist name
[0:32:15] <%cureneckbeard> Their names are different in Japanese, that's why you're confused.
[0:32:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Better Names", you mean
[0:32:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> you can't throw a phoenix down on elmo, he's getting old and that'll start to damage soon
[0:32:24] <%manwithboxonhead> apatBig Terrorism apatGoblin
[0:32:27] <@lewdskeletor13> Stupid names? Wait, these names aren’t canon?
[0:32:27] <%PipIV> "FREEDOM FIGHTIN'"
[0:32:28] <+asgard147> limesLUL
[0:32:29] <%starotter70> Nice
[0:32:30] <SummonerMagno> miss??
[0:32:32] <%galaxyswirl> @AngriestPat do you think they will keep the naming of characters in the remake?
[0:32:35] <+Aeogard> i should play ff7 sometime...
[0:32:37] <%SirGO0SE> Stupid? Who stands bravely before the great Clumbo?
[0:32:39] <%Kashi_Nin> yeyeye
[0:32:40] <dailylifewithry> What did Clumbo mean?
[0:32:45] <CrypticMochi> Name Vincent Elmo
[0:32:48] <VirtuaRailith> cloud + stumbo
[0:32:48] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> YAY BEEFERS
[0:32:49] <mojokingizakku> cloud?
[0:32:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Clumsy Stumbo
[0:32:50] <zmuno> Knucles?? OMG
[0:32:51] <%Kashi_Nin> bumbo cloud
[0:32:52] <Funky_Honkey> I can't see his controller, what version is he playing?
[0:32:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Switch
[0:32:58] <%Frost_Quill> @dailylifewithry Stumbo with a Cl because his name is Cloud.
[0:32:59] <mojokingizakku> you mean clumbo
[0:32:59] <+mistspade> 7 not 8
[0:33:03] <natebud> @galaxyswirl Think about what that means. The characters can never say eachother's names in dialogue.
[0:33:04] <+Aeogard> who gets to do the dps limit break
[0:33:05] <KingKZ> Every game needs a "go fucking faster" button.
[0:33:09] <%AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat be sure to steal the staff for Ass4Dayz from the centaur/chariot motherfucker
[0:33:19] <moosemonkey397> only 1 level 4 for each character
[0:33:21] <%galaxyswirl> @natebud that is true...good point
[0:33:21] <%Gogogolem> Especially sonic games.
[0:33:22] <alrobot2014> i believe there's a materia in this area
[0:33:30] <%Kashi_Nin> yeah Stumbo. Plumbo is plumpy stumbo... if thats important...
[0:33:34] <%ShichiNoBushi> You ate your only tent.
[0:33:37] <%AncelDeLambert> nope
[0:33:42] <InugamiTheHound> you need to go to the golden saucer for onmislash, which is fucking hard same with getting knights of round table
[0:33:43] <%galaxyswirl> why bother getting anything for ass4dayz?
[0:33:52] <Funky_Honkey> there's a chest on top of one of the train carts but I don't remember what was in it
[0:33:56] <%AdmiralButtloaf> next screen i think
[0:33:56] <alrobot2014> my memory of the last few months may be shittting itself
[0:33:57] <+cinder_chan> is pats hp a reference to when he was born cause he's old as fuck?
[0:34:02] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> @galaxyswirl Co-sign
[0:34:03] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, we'd rather you read a guide than listen to chat
[0:34:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> because ass4days is broken good
[0:34:05] <%SirGO0SE> ps1 copy runs like a dream on pc, tested it earlier. i forgot that ps1 games are forwards compatible forever
[0:34:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Not too many people know this, but Cloud is a mistranslation of the main character's Japanese name, Kuranbo
[0:34:09] <GustauveVIII> to get the second lvl limit break you have to last hit 80 monsters PER CHARACTER
[0:34:10] <Fien111> There's 2 materias and you've already missed 3 of them
[0:34:20] <%patriotrenegade> Yo I hear Aeris dies
[0:34:27] <%happyface699> Great music fuck man
[0:34:30] <%PipIV> Aerith
[0:34:30] <%cureneckbeard> aeris isn't in this one
[0:34:30] <Zjay87> Steal a powerful weapon from horse enemies
[0:34:30] <mankeyfigh> Oh the steal tech is hard, and he needs to find the specific CREATURE
[0:34:31] <%AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat I think he only spawns in the next screen
[0:34:31] <+golfertony> getting the kill count in those areas that spawn 5 enemies is good. usning enemy skills and all magic
[0:34:35] <otaku9392> wasnt that an item
[0:34:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the amount of monsters actually varies from character to character
[0:34:35] <%Owkono> the little dragons have ethers
[0:34:35] <disflipmat> oh shit, did you miss Steal?
[0:34:37] <%Shackle_Rustyford> is this the switch version @AngriestPat
[0:34:41] <%Kashi_Nin> Ass4Dayz
[0:34:42] <%anticrust> anticrust subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 19 month streak! Oh shit, I had something to say for this... uhhhhh....

[0:34:53] <shinichizio> Nailed it
[0:34:55] <@StridentSong> "You've missed every possible thing ever in the game." -chat
[0:34:59] <%happyface699> PET THE PAIGE
[0:35:00] <EuropanLamprey> @patriotrenegade Does Snape kill her?
[0:35:08] <%AncelDeLambert> God Uemetsu
[0:35:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Still one of the best OSTs.
[0:35:13] <%Frost_Quill> Ass4Dayz kills Dumbledore.
[0:35:16] <+golfertony> so this obviously isnt blind but what is pats experience with ff7?
[0:35:20] <%PipIV> if you miss anything you'll be MILES AWAY
[0:35:22] <SirSmudgey> I've been spoiled by Max's modded playthrough
[0:35:23] <%MoraMiarty> MoraMiarty subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! I love final fantasy and I wub you patwick
[0:35:25] <%starotter70> Can't wait to hear the remake ost
[0:35:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the first forest you encounter is a good place for farming enemies for limit breaks.
[0:35:37] <%twoto858> what's your favorite track in this game?
[0:35:38] <natebud> @galaxyswirl If they do text box dialogue like yakuza it might be possible though.
[0:35:40] <%wjones0415> it's old school ff, of course you love it!
[0:35:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Are the animations sped up??
[0:35:41] <+LandOfTheWay> @europanlamprey no, it's actually Ozymandias who kills her
[0:35:48] <Xalgar> Does Pat know that he can just increase battle speed without having to use 300% speed?
[0:35:50] <%Kashi_Nin> cheer500 Speaking of Switch ports, apparently Grandia 1&2 are getting ports soon?
[0:35:55] <%thefishofwar> thefishofwar subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Heya Pat! Just finished all the role quests in Shadowbringers (DRK WHM DNC RDM) and got that BIG extra lore drop! Have you gotten the chance to see all that stuff yet, and if so what didja think? Either way hope the stream goes well!
[0:35:56] <Fien111> @golfertony I believe he said he played it like 6 times but 20 years ago
[0:35:57] <Louie_Salmon> On the fast speed Cloud looks he's about to fly away on his sword
[0:35:59] <shinichizio> Can you go FASTER than 300%
[0:36:00] <%PipIV> as you do
[0:36:00] <+Greywyn00> can't you also get yuffie in the first forest
[0:36:04] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> @golfertony I could be wrong but I think he has forgotten a lot. So it's fairly fresh.
[0:36:05] <+chaumiester> So how much Woolie splooged when they announced Guilty Gear Pat?
[0:36:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Greywyn00 yup
[0:36:09] <%SirGO0SE> @AngriestPat do you remember that Kotaku article from awhile ago about the guy who leveled Cloud and Barret to 99 before moving forward? He was from luelinks (eti) if you still remember being on that site. he logged the entire process in a thread, its great
[0:36:10] <%manwithboxonhead> So I have been grinding of screan...
[0:36:11] <%Theophilus567> I believe you can steal ethers from those flappy guys
[0:36:16] <%GabeSweetMan> ....huh.
[0:36:16] <%cureneckbeard> grinding off stream, classic pat
[0:36:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Greywyn00 any forest really
[0:36:23] <%MagickBurritoh> big cheats
[0:36:23] <MetroidSlayerP7> Get multiple copies of STEAL so you can STEAL+ALL and STEAL+SNEAK ATTACK
[0:36:24] <@StridentSong> cheer1000 How dare. Top spot is mine.
[0:36:24] <MassConnect> boo this version
[0:36:28] <%RupanSen> fucked
[0:36:29] <%manwithboxonhead> *screen
[0:36:29] <%GabeSweetMan> apatBig CHEATS
[0:36:29] <%BarbellGoose> Is the super lvl 99 button reversible? Or do you have to reload?
[0:36:36] <%Kashi_Nin> lol @StridentSong
[0:36:37] <MoonObscure> puss mode then
[0:36:39] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, the best place to farm limit breaks is on the broken train tracks before you get to Gold Saucer. Use matra magic on the groups of up to five enemies for quick kills
[0:36:39] <TastySammiches> big boy does a big cheat
[0:36:40] <SirSmudgey> No encounters? What's the point of Enemy Away Materia?
[0:36:41] <MassConnect> like, I know it wasn't a hard game originally
[0:36:42] <%Frost_Quill> Where do you first get steal again?
[0:36:43] <+Shockrates20XX> You can steal ethers from the dragon dudes, and a good staff for Ass4Dayz from the wheel guy.
[0:36:44] <%Kashi_Nin> apatBig apatBig apatBig
[0:36:50] <dailylifewithry> Ah, just like the PS4 port, awesome
[0:36:53] <%happyface699> apatBig apatBig apatBig apatBig
[0:36:56] <%Kashi_Nin> but yeah I had some spares to dump
[0:36:56] <KaseKaizer> ew
[0:36:58] <disflipmat> Those are some sharp trains
[0:36:59] <Xalgar> I mean, it's not like FF7 was insanely hard
[0:37:00] <%MoraMiarty> I wont
[0:37:00] <%starotter70> Beautiful
[0:37:02] <%MoraMiarty> you can't make me
[0:37:03] <MassConnect> but people should put in work to cheese their game
[0:37:04] <%GabeSweetMan> WHAT COULD POSSIBLY MOVE?
[0:37:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Yo theres a song called Stumbo by Wiseblood
[0:37:07] <Supervyxen> >Not the original PS1 version WutFace
[0:37:09] <natebud> I had the worst time emulating this on exps1, played to Kalm and lost all my saves.
[0:37:10] <+asgard147> That is rough limesS
[0:37:12] <@lewdskeletor13> Is this the best FF to start on for new players?
[0:37:20] <%GabeSweetMan> I wonder which of these background elements can or cannot move????
[0:37:20] <MassConnect> X is best
[0:37:21] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the best FF period
[0:37:21] <%razielhex> @Xalgar RUBY/EMERALD weapon were tough and had gimmicks.
[0:37:22] <shiny_prinny> i had to use the cheats to get through FF8 because i was so bored and just wanted to see the story
[0:37:23] <InugamiTheHound> @lewdskeletor13 final fantasy 10
[0:37:24] <%MoraMiarty> How dare you even insinuate that
[0:37:25] <%happyface699> Oof
[0:37:33] <%Gogogolem> Go Suckles
[0:37:35] <TastySammiches> ff7 is pretty good for newbies
[0:37:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Most of the FF are fine to start with
[0:37:35] <%MoraMiarty> Play IV
[0:37:36] <%manwithboxonhead> @lewdskeletor13 This or FFX
[0:37:36] <%Wrashis> 10 is probably the best place to start
[0:37:36] <%Kashi_Nin> this or 10?
[0:37:36] <Terrabyte0> I say 10
[0:37:37] <disflipmat> @lewdskeletor13 If you can stand the graphics it's VERY accessible
[0:37:37] <dailylifewithry> @lewdskeletor13 This is pretty good, Final Fantasy X as well
[0:37:38] <%MoraMiarty> Or VI
[0:37:40] <Xalgar> @razielhex Yeah but they were optional right?
[0:37:42] <%SirGO0SE> i think it took my buddy 500 hours to level cloud and barret to 99 before scorpion
[0:37:42] <%Frost_Quill> Is FF7 good on the PS2? I don't know where my PS1 is but I still have my PS2 connected and everything.
[0:37:43] <%MoraMiarty> Or hell, play V
[0:37:43] <moosemonkey397> probabhlyt 10
[0:37:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It was my first FF, and I like FF now....
[0:37:45] <%ColonelRozum> @lewdskeletor13 its the best final fantasy
[0:37:49] <broomclaws> FFX
[0:37:49] <Supervyxen> 10 sucks ass so it's not good for either new or existing fans.
[0:37:50] <TastySammiches> anything but 8 or 13 tbh
[0:37:50] <%Keyd00d> it's not hard
[0:37:51] <alrobot2014> ff5 is a prety alright starting point
[0:37:51] <mojokingizakku> 6?
[0:37:53] <hippieofdeath> Prolly IX
[0:37:56] <%PipIV> so. many. Roman numerals.
[0:37:58] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, tehy're undead, use cure
[0:37:59] <%nmaten> just get into it
[0:38:00] <disflipmat> I'd say FF7 and FFX are the most accessible games in the series
[0:38:02] <%starotter70> I'd say it's totally fine to start here
[0:38:02] <%galaxyswirl> six is the best to start on
[0:38:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> They're all their own thing really
[0:38:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Are these the bitch woolie ghosts?
[0:38:04] <%RupanSen> VII and IX are both S tier FF for me
[0:38:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pretty much
[0:38:11] <%razielhex> @Xalgar Yeah, they were optional bosses, like Culex from SMRPG. You can tke out Sephiroth in 2 attacks.
[0:38:12] <+projectmanatees> mystic quest could be a good one
[0:38:14] <%templar010> Pick one and go
[0:38:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> With Final Fantasy, you can just jump in wherever
[0:38:16] <%Kashi_Nin> I guess it depends more on what type of fantasy you're in to
[0:38:18] <%happyface699> Just play it
[0:38:19] <Louie_Salmon> They're literally just all their own games, play the ones you want to
[0:38:19] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat You should put the steal materia on your highest level character, it has a greater chance of succeding
[0:38:19] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> If ff8 let’s you play through it with dead squall I’ll think about picking it up
[0:38:20] <%Keyd00d> Start at I
[0:38:20] <%manwithboxonhead> sbfpBleetz sbfpBleetz sbfpBleetz You know the game.
[0:38:21] <%PipIV> throw a dart.
[0:38:23] <Aydarkzero> i feel like any FF numbered game is fine to play
[0:38:24] <%Frost_Quill> Ten is the only one I've 100% completed. I plan on 100% completing X-2 eventually.
[0:38:26] <%happyface699> Play all
[0:38:26] <MassConnect> the best hook for FF is Lulu. period
[0:38:26] <disflipmat> WHAT ABOUT THE LORE, PAT
[0:38:28] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> The remake
[0:38:30] <+Greywyn00> I like 3 though
[0:38:31] <%MoraMiarty> the ds remake of III is fine
[0:38:32] <TastySammiches> don't start at 8 or 13
[0:38:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Pick one that looks cool
[0:38:32] <shinichizio> Don't do the crap ones that were invented before q uality.
[0:38:33] <%razielhex> @AngriestPat Best answer: Start with Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest
[0:38:33] <%starotter70> Oops I hit 15
[0:38:36] <+millionstabz> 8?
[0:38:36] <Daxalog> They are all piss baby easy anyway
[0:38:36] <MetroidSlayerP7> The best Final Fantasy to start getting into is Chrono Trigger
[0:38:37] <natebud> Never get in with the best entry. Then it's all downhill. Not that I'm saying FF7 is THE best.
[0:38:37] <CrypticMochi> Anything but 8 or 13
[0:38:39] <vulkans2> I would say 6
[0:38:39] <+millionstabz> Say 8 rite now
[0:38:40] <Nina96> y not 2 0r 3?
[0:38:40] <alrobot2014> what's wrong with 3?
[0:38:41] <Funky_Honkey> we don't talk about 13
[0:38:42] <%AncelDeLambert> don't do 13, just skip that
[0:38:44] <moosemonkey397> 11 and 14 seem like a weird place to start
[0:38:45] <$valriot> 12 sucks
[0:38:45] <%SirGO0SE> yeah sometimes its sword and board fantasy, sometimes you gots the mecha, sometimes theres race war, who knows
[0:38:45] <%EmiinV> I enjoyed playing 13
[0:38:47] <Nina96> *or
[0:38:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> there is no FF8
[0:38:49] <%Wrashis> the games dont have shared lore
[0:38:50] <TastySammiches> the lore is seperate
[0:38:50] <%EmiinV> rangel2Woah
[0:38:52] <%ThatOneGameTester> what about 15?
[0:38:52] <InugamiTheHound> final fantasy 15 is good start same with 10 and 12.
[0:38:53] <%BarbellGoose> I always get hate for this, but I loved ff12
[0:38:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> Kreygasm
[0:38:54] <%Frost_Quill> There is SOME lore. Like X and 7 being in the same universe.
[0:38:55] <$afronooch> Tactics is the best one tho
[0:38:56] <%Kashi_Nin> @MetroidSlayerP7 I see what you did there. Yes.
[0:38:58] <Xalgar> @razielhex Yeah so the core game is a pretty chill experience besides dealing with getting Frogged LUL
[0:38:58] <%templar010> there are shared creatures and themes/character tripes
[0:39:00] <%starotter70> YE YE YE
[0:39:01] <+Greywyn00> nah 12 is actually great with Zodiac Age
[0:39:01] <Louie_Salmon> Oh look, a smash move!
[0:39:03] <+tylerpyre> HeHe he do the smash bros move
[0:39:05] <shinichizio> Where the hell did THAT magic lie lore come from?
[0:39:05] <%happyface699> apatBig no lord
[0:39:05] <BioStormX> Did you not install the remako background textures mod? It's seriously amazing
[0:39:06] <%GarbageNirvana> 11 and 14 are if you want an MMO with your RPG
[0:39:07] <%templar010> but each game is for the most part self-contained
[0:39:08] <%galaxyswirl> i feel like im the only person that liked 8 more than 7
[0:39:08] <nehaerys> lightning returns was kinds fun
[0:39:08] <%Biwaifu> Biwaifu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 6 month streak! yayayaya
[0:39:08] <+UncleAWOL> walked away for 5 to get skittles, did anything catastrophically world ending happen?
[0:39:09] <%MoraMiarty> any Final fantasy that doesn't have a hyphen in the name is unrelated to any other game in the series
[0:39:09] <+mik255> have you seen max's playthrough of the mod?
[0:39:11] <TastySammiches> the only game with lore outside of itself is FF12
[0:39:12] <JoeTierGod> Lore: Chocobos
[0:39:15] <%vectorless_peon> you crazy people saying 13 and 15
[0:39:18] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> 8 is getting a remake can’t say it’s not a thing
[0:39:18] <%GarbageNirvana> And 11 is, like, way old-school
[0:39:19] <+mistspade> @AngriestPat but FFX in very tangentially a prequel to 7
[0:39:19] <%RupanSen> 8 is very flawd but still a good FF imho
[0:39:20] <Louie_Salmon> It's really cool how for the switch version, they gave him that move from Smash.
[0:39:22] <JoeTierGod> That’s it
[0:39:22] <%Frost_Quill> Kid Shinra from X's group would become the Shinra group in 7.
[0:39:22] <disflipmat> Lightning Returns was a fantastic Valkyrie Profile game
[0:39:25] <+LandOfTheWay> @frost_quill x and vii are in the same universe?
[0:39:25] <%MoraMiarty> except for the ffIV sequel we pretend doesn'tt exxistt
[0:39:27] <InugamiTheHound> Then after that 7,8,9, 13 trilogy and type 0
[0:39:28] <+tylerpyre> Nintendo let SE use Clumbo in their spinoff game?
[0:39:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is Tifa called Knuckles because her beefrs stick through her shirt like knuckles
[0:39:31] <TastySammiches> @eldritchhorrortwitchchat remaster, but yeah
[0:39:31] <%chiefironsdidnothingwrong> chiefironsdidnothingwrong subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Tifa must have been confused when she walked into the shop to get a slutty dress in order to seduce Don Corneo and walked out with a dress that covered more then her regular outfit.
[0:39:39] <%Frost_Quill> @LandOfTheWay I'm pretty sure yeah.
[0:39:39] <%supersugoisenpai1> Choo choo
[0:39:40] <%happyface699> That music oooh wee
[0:39:44] <MassConnect> is it too late to name one character "nothing," and another "less?"
[0:39:46] <+mik255> @AngriestPat have you seen max's playthrough of the modded ff7
[0:39:50] <%happyface699> So pretty
[0:39:51] <dailylifewithry> 13 has a fun battle system, kinda wack writing
[0:39:52] <%Frost_Quill> @LandOfTheWay Different planets though.
[0:39:59] <%MoraMiarty> tfw tifa will never final heaven you
[0:40:00] <megaman_sentinel> 9 is the 1 that had trance right ?
[0:40:03] <%razielhex> @Xalgar There's some annoying bosses, but the best defensive skill is learned from an enemy in the beach town with Hojo in it that basically gives you all defenses as an enemy skill. It's really just how far do you want to go down the chocobo breeding hole to get KOTR and final break skills.
[0:40:03] <%starotter70> "Most unlucky for you"
[0:40:09] <MoonObscure> this game is perfect
[0:40:09] <%RupanSen> absolutely
[0:40:14] <natebud> It's like a little set.
[0:40:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> FF8 is a good game with bad characters. People only retroactively like it because of Kingdom Hearts.
[0:40:16] <%Kashi_Nin> The dynamic camera stuff is great too.
[0:40:18] <%Gogogolem> You're Old? but you don't look a day over 60.
[0:40:19] <%SirGO0SE> ive only got 3,4,5,6,7,9 and tactics under my belt. 10 never caught me and i lost track of the series there
[0:40:25] <%GabeSweetMan> Flat textures scale a lot better.
[0:40:26] <%BarbellGoose> The cleaned up models look great in this version.
[0:40:31] <%RupanSen> IX with the Moguri Mod looks incredible
[0:40:32] <%MoraMiarty> I miss ATB
[0:40:34] <%Schrodingers_Box> Final Fantasy 3 was the first game for me, got it on one of these Game Boy Cartridges with like 30 games that shops sold on holiday.
[0:40:36] <%razielhex> There's some magic tricks like always using the Bravery item on your people to put them in an enrage status to build limits faster.
[0:40:37] <+Shockrates20XX> FF8 is a good game with one bad mechanic, the Draw system.
[0:40:39] <%happyface699> Awwwwww pat sounds so happy
[0:40:41] <+Greywyn00> I'm doing 3-6 in order, currently almost done with 3
[0:40:41] <%AncelDeLambert> ditto, and I think they're going too far
[0:40:56] <+StrawberryPantsu> @AngriestPat So you just wanted FF8 Remastered for FF7
[0:40:57] <BioStormX> Then you should use Remako
[0:40:58] <%AncelDeLambert> this reboot is making me nervous
[0:40:59] <disflipmat> The detail on the FF7 models is so low that just bumping up the resolution makes them look great
[0:41:01] <MetroidSlayerP7> New models mean new animations. Old animations would look weird with photo real.
[0:41:02] <shiny_prinny> 8 is bad for the draw/junction system, 13 is a big hallway, 15 has bad combat
[0:41:07] <disflipmat> Now imagine trying to do this to FF8's models
[0:41:07] <%razielhex> And that you can find multiple ribbons and morph cuactars into those meta-elemental accessories.
[0:41:09] <%Edgy_Macaroon> I don't think many wanted massive changes
[0:41:10] <natebud> You mean the RE2 remake?
[0:41:13] <Funky_Honkey> I want Chrono Trigger cleaned up and nothing else done to it. Matter of fact, just re-release Chrono Trigger as is.
[0:41:14] <%SirGO0SE> the people i know who like FF8 like it alot
[0:41:16] <Xalgar> FF8 is controversial, but it has Gunblades :)
[0:41:20] <+Shockrates20XX> Hang around here until you can steal the staff.
[0:41:21] <%Kashi_Nin> oooo. kinda, yeah?
[0:41:24] <InugamiTheHound> I want s final fantasy 8 remake after ff7 remake
[0:41:32] <shinichizio> I want an FF2 remaster. Fix this concept, you big cowards.
[0:41:32] <%razielhex> also HELL HOUSE
[0:41:34] <%Wrashis> id say most people would have preferred ff7 remake to be turn based
[0:41:35] <CrypticMochi> I would like a 8 remake
[0:41:35] <Xalgar> Did Pat miss "All"?
[0:41:38] <%RubberFistFight> @Funky_Honkey they released it on the 3DS a little while back didn't they?
[0:41:39] <alrobot2014> i think the materia is in one of the train cars in the last screen iirc?
[0:41:39] <BioStormX> Remako uses AI to clean up all the pre-rendered backgrounds and FMVs
[0:41:40] <dailylifewithry> @sirgo0se X is one where you definitely need to take things under good faith, considering that the characters and presentation are so weird and memey at times. That said, the core of the story, music, art, and battle system are all on point.
[0:41:40] <%starotter70> Does that mean you'll play FF8?
[0:41:41] <Funky_Honkey> whens HELL HOUSE
[0:41:42] <%Frost_Quill> This was my first Final Fantasy as a kid but I was TERRIBLE at games and the "attack it when it's tail is up" translation error made me quit. Never played past it.
[0:41:44] <%AdmiralButtloaf> just run around a but
[0:41:45] <%AdmiralButtloaf> bit
[0:41:46] <+kitkatcake> ff8 is legitimately amazing if you give it a chance
[0:41:46] <%razielhex> WE WANT HELL HOUSE
[0:41:46] <%GabeSweetMan> "Yo, where my HORSE DICK AT?" -Pat
[0:41:46] <%Kashi_Nin> 2 spoopy bois and a majestic flap flap
[0:41:47] <mojokingizakku> bark if you're his centaurs
[0:41:50] <+mik255> FF8 starts off with a really interesting premise and squall has a cool design
[0:41:50] <Xalgar> @Funky_Honkey SOON
[0:41:52] <disflipmat> We already went passed Hell House
[0:41:53] <%AncelDeLambert> there's like twenty ALLs that drop in this game, never worry about finding them
[0:41:57] <Funky_Honkey> @RubberFistFight yeah but they messed with it.
[0:41:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> there will never be an ff8 remake.
[0:42:01] <mankeyfigh> The percent chance is LOW PAT
[0:42:03] <$jobbedbone> why are they called gunblades when they just vibrate, not shoot
[0:42:06] <OldOnyx> remastered 7 basically already exists on pc via mods
[0:42:06] <MassConnect> I think you have to go back for centaur
[0:42:09] <HelluvaNohbody> I rather have 8’s mechanics retooled from the ground up
[0:42:14] <%shawntk_> @rumtumtugnutz Never say never
[0:42:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> So will you stream the FF7 Remake when it comes out?
[0:42:20] <%Owkono> ghosts hate cure
[0:42:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> NEVER
[0:42:23] <%Frost_Quill> We saw Hell House last time.
[0:42:24] <dailylifewithry> @frost_quill You know, can’t even fault you, that translation...
[0:42:24] <+mik255> but ff8 then has a really dumb twist that even as a kid i thought was dumb
[0:42:29] <%Theophilus567> Nah you don’t have to go back. They’re just rare
[0:42:32] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Ff8 is good if squall is dead the entire time vargDorf
[0:42:32] <%starotter70> The best thing about FF8 is the opening
[0:42:36] <Funky_Honkey> @RubberFistFight also that version is really annoying to get a hold of now.
[0:42:39] <Quietshun13> oh man I love these sound effects
[0:42:43] <mankeyfigh> RARE ENCOUNTER
[0:42:43] <+kitkatcake> yeah but laguna is a fucking baller
[0:42:44] <%SirGO0SE> @dailylifewithry I think its cheap AF on PC, I should bring it up. I think the main reason I didn't play it is bc I grabbed a ps2 late in its life cycle
[0:42:55] <%razielhex> I think there's one boss in Nibelheim that's a major pain in the ass before you go bother Vincent.
[0:42:55] <%MoraMiarty> how would you feel if you shot a man and he glowed red then faded from existence
[0:42:58] <Aydarkzero> centuar farm PogChamp
[0:42:59] <Dementedpenguin> @mik255 I think I might know what you're talking about. If it is, I hated it too, LUL
[0:43:01] <+Shockrates20XX> But big upgrade.
[0:43:01] <%AdmiralButtloaf> staff has 32 attack
[0:43:03] <%Kashi_Nin> #outofcontextpat
[0:43:04] <%This_is_Marco> cant wait to see hellhouse or big shoes in remake LUL
[0:43:08] <+mik255> man i wish we got a whole game with laguna
[0:43:11] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Laguna had a great theme
[0:43:13] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's just an Aerith staff if you really care for that
[0:43:17] <Xalgar> The staff hit noise Kreygasm
[0:43:22] <%razielhex> beekBONK
[0:43:26] <%AdmiralButtloaf> makes aeris as strong as cloud almost
[0:43:26] <InugamiTheHound> one of my favorite Cloud's limit breaks is Meteorain
[0:43:27] <AMDBR9S> god this music so good
[0:43:42] <%Frost_Quill> Hell House better be in the remake. And the ENTIRE segment with Cloud crossdressing better be in it. They better not remove a single fucking part of that part of the game.
[0:43:50] <%TheLostArcader> TheLostArcader subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:43:53] <%SirGO0SE> i never hear anyone bring up X-2, is it actually bad or did people just hate the idea of girl squad
[0:43:54] <alrobot2014> F for that guy in a few minutes
[0:43:57] <+asgard147> Train man limesFeels
[0:44:01] <%Kashi_Nin> The crossdressing this is confirmed I think
[0:44:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> Make it ugly
[0:44:04] <%GabeSweetMan> I FORGOT ABOUT THIS
[0:44:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't spread rumors, or else they'll come true

[0:45:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'm not against the idea of an FF8 remake, but unlike FF7 that's one of the best selling games of the Playstation Era, and is STILL a unit mover for Square, FF8 in its time was critically ripped apart, and it didn't sell well enough for them to even consider a remaster for 20 years. Meanwhile FF7 got remastered three times I think?

[0:49:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @BappoSama from the mind of pat. are we really surprised
[0:49:54] <Dementedpenguin> Imagine playing FFVII back in 1997 as a kid and you see that shit.
[0:49:57] <Baconrath> but thou must
[0:50:00] <%logoth_> Should have named Tifa Chesty La'rue
[0:50:00] <InugamiTheHound> I think Biggs and Wedge from FF8 are better than ff7 version
[0:50:01] <%supersugoisenpai1> Dang it Clumbo, stop being a dumbo
[0:50:03] <%starotter70> Consume Wedge, Gain More Power!
[0:50:16] <%manwithboxonhead> Knuckles: What should we do with Wedge's body?
[0:50:18] <Desertfishing> look at the guy peeing
[0:50:19] <ovan20> @AngriestPat Xenogears streams, when? :P
[0:50:21] <+Tokanova> They gon die
[0:50:22] <BappoSama> @Sphincter_Spelunker I mean to be fair, I was expecting a little class..
[0:50:24] <%vaporousTippler> Biggs and Wedge in 6 were best. They were actual pilots.
[0:50:25] <%manwithboxonhead> Clumbo: Leave him
[0:50:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> bitch, you gon' die
[0:50:29] <+Tokanova> They ALL gonna die
[0:50:30] <BappoSama> But i guess that was a bit much.

[0:51:28] <%templar010> LOOk at these idiotsd
[0:51:32] <%Ilpala> love that you got snuck up on by a pair of losers literally flying by spinning something REALLY FAST
[0:51:33] <MetroidSlayerP7> Biggs will never get to use his harpoons and tow-cables ever again :(
[0:51:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> I didn't know Shinra employed the Sith from Star Wars Rebels
[0:52:00] <%RupanSen> Woolie sold Avanche to Shinra for those sweet propellers
[0:52:01] <MassConnect> I don't remember Biggs on Hoth
[0:52:01] <%Gogogolem> whats a shovel knight enemy doing here?
[0:52:15] <%Kashi_Nin> oh heli-rats
[0:52:23] <%wjones0415> probably when you cheated!
[0:52:25] <Fien111> "So what's our plan of attack, men?" "We float over on hand-held propellers in bright right and attack them with propellers held in the other hand!" "BRILLIANT!"
[0:52:35] <%starotter70> It's so nice that the fanfare doesn't play in these moments
[0:52:56] <%Rust_Wick> is remake still going to be episodic?
[0:52:58] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Think you'll unlock Yuffie and Vincent?
[0:53:10] <Applecannon63> Jessie...
[0:53:14] <thegreenbenis> MAJOR F
[0:53:14] <%supersugoisenpai1> @Rust_Wick Yeah
[0:53:16] <disflipmat> Pat there are mods on PC that keep the battle music from changing. It works really well for tone
[0:53:16] <%GabeSweetMan> FFFFFFFFFFF
[0:53:18] <%manwithboxonhead> They are hard to miss
[0:53:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> bye worst gurl

[0:53:21] <+DarkNerdShawny> @Rust_Wick not episodic, didnt games.

[0:53:37] <%dheng1> Chuck some feathers at her
[0:53:37] <%XzileGaming> Jessie the true hero
[0:53:38] <mercado94> I wish FFXV did the same and keep playing somnus when you reach the city
[0:53:41] <Baconrath> i love these goofy ass helicopter dudes
[0:53:41] <@lewdskeletor13> Remember kids, don’t do the big terrorism
[0:53:42] <%Ilpala> Uninterrupted music time is the best. This one's up there but the best one is in FFX
[0:53:42] <+PlagueOfGripes> remember in Twilight Princess when during the Midna-may-DIE scene, the dramatic music keeps getting interrupted with generic battle music because of rando goblins?
[0:53:43] <MassConnect> is avalanche like PETA?
[0:53:45] <%Ilpala> on the road to Zanarkand
[0:53:46] <%wjones0415> yeah, poetic justice. terrorist scum!
[0:53:49] <mankeyfigh> @screamlord I’m amazed this game lets you skip characters
[0:53:50] <%logoth_> Jessie you probably died because you had tit armor
[0:53:57] <Fien111> I guess we were the terrorist bombings of civilian industries all along....
[0:53:59] <%BarbellGoose> No avalanche is like greepeace
[0:54:00] <Parapattern> Clumbo do big terrorism
[0:54:09] <ScreamLord> Every permanent death in this game is hilarious because Phoenix Downs exist
[0:54:10] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> god look at that future married couple
[0:54:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @thegreenbenis and give it to who. the deady mcdeaderson over there? LUL
[0:54:18] <%XzileGaming> more like "Knockers"
[0:54:21] <%hot4dukat> @logoth lol
[0:54:26] <%Keyd00d> no
[0:54:29] <%starotter70> Good times
[0:54:32] <%Kashi_Nin> yes
[0:54:34] <MetroidSlayerP7> Clumbo's final limit break is "Just One More Thing"
[0:54:36] <Baconrath> @BarbellGoose avalance messed up the nazca lines Kappa
[0:54:39] <thegreenbenis> @Sphincter_Spelunker Worst girl belongs to Yuffie
[0:54:41] <dailylifewithry> How deep? Knuckles deep!
[0:54:41] <%MoraMiarty> Clumbos most powerful limit break: Omniclump
[0:54:46] <Dementedpenguin> Kill that helicopter, Johmn McClaine style.
[0:54:51] <%cureneckbeard> at full force
[0:54:57] <@lewdskeletor13> Columbo did the biggest terrorism
[0:55:00] <%starotter70> Time to turn Chewie into a Tank
[0:55:12] <%logoth_> Theyre attacking from a lego helicopter
[0:55:12] <%supersugoisenpai1> Quick, put the magic rocks in your weapons
[0:55:14] <%MoraMiarty> BRRRRT
[0:55:17] <%razielhex> @lewdskeletor13 Just the facts, Skeletor
[0:55:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> boop
[0:55:25] <+Tokanova> how does barrett reload his arm
[0:55:28] <%nmaten> that was a good boop
[0:55:32] <%manwithboxonhead> apatFist apatFist apatFist
[0:55:34] <shinichizio> What a cool guy.
[0:55:34] <ScreamLord> @mankeyfigh Yeah, Yuffie and Vincent are totally optional party members that you can go the whole game without seeing. They aren't even in the ending FMVs.
[0:55:36] <dailylifewithry> The Turks did nothing wrong
[0:55:37] <Thalchampz> SourPls
[0:55:37] <%dheng1> Infinite ammo
[0:55:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> kick him in the nuts
[0:55:39] <+PlagueOfGripes> time to crush Reno's testicles
[0:55:39] <SleepyMaribo> FF7 machinima abridged flash backs...
[0:55:40] <$jobbedbone> @Tokanova carefully
[0:55:41] <@lewdskeletor13> Is he fucking Porky Pig?
[0:55:43] <T3merity> nothing personnel, kids
[0:55:43] <mankeyfigh> RENO’s a PUSSY
[0:55:43] <InugamiTheHound> does putting certain material on certain slots have a certain impact?
[0:55:45] <%razielhex> Turks are the FF7 Jobbers
[0:55:45] <Dementedpenguin> Three people, not one was protecting the dashboard....
[0:55:45] <Thalchampz> time to break Reno's dick
[0:55:46] <Nekros4442> Man...I really hope Reno and Rude are just their AC versions
[0:55:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> Punch him right in the dick
[0:55:48] <+HeyBoston> how did no one ever accidentally hit that button
[0:55:49] <%hot4dukat> @MetroidSlayerP7 right? lmao
[0:55:50] <WhereIsWill> LETS GO TURKS
[0:55:52] <%manwithboxonhead> VoteYea apatFist
[0:55:53] <Teh_Un> Reno's sprite looks nothing like his Advent Children version
[0:55:53] <%starotter70> The Turks do terrible shit, but we still love them!
[0:55:56] <%XzileGaming> @Tokanova kinda just happens over time, like a bepis
[0:55:58] <%Kashi_Nin> give 'em the triangles, Boss!
[0:56:02] <%Ilpala> don't taze me bro
[0:56:03] <$BoundlessBroadcast> hey @AngriestPat ! Glad I finally caught one of your streams. cheer100
[0:56:03] <$jobbedbone> use the rudebuster
[0:56:05] <%razielhex> The only good Turk was Vincent, and that's saying something
[0:56:05] <%radda343> I hate that Squeenix has tried to frame Reno as a good guy even though he fucking murdered hundreds of people
[0:56:10] <%wjones0415> why doesnt barrett's ever shoot people beforehand?
[0:56:11] <Fien111> Reno just caused the death of thousands! We're gonna completely forget about this after we kick his ass once and ally with him later!......that MONSTER!
[0:56:13] <Basch71> Reno kills like thousands with that button push
[0:56:16] <%razielhex> Elena was competent, I guess
[0:56:21] <%yet_another_brony> have you tried ralsei's pacify
[0:56:21] <%supersugoisenpai1> Barret is a good tank
[0:56:23] <mankeyfigh> SOLVED
[0:56:27] <DSMatticus> You know, now that I think about it, is it seriously just one button to start the whole 'blow up critical city infrastructure?'
[0:56:36] <ScreamLord> @mankeyfigh I'll give Dirge of Cerberus one thing tho. At least they explain what those two were doing and why they we rent in the ending cutscenes.
[0:56:36] <SleepyMaribo> Elena was a idiot, Rude was a OG
[0:56:40] <$jobbedbone> barret isn't the good kind of bara tho
[0:56:42] <DSMatticus> Like, you think they make nuclear power plants with ONE button labelled "fuck this shit up, for reals"
[0:56:42] <%Frost_Quill> @Fien111 I mean so did AVALANCHE.
[0:56:45] <%manwithboxonhead> Pyramid Head what are you doing here
[0:56:57] <%Rust_Wick> oh shit i just remembered, do you think cissnei will be mentioned in remake?
[0:56:58] <%Nedlin> Do you lose if all party members get traingle'd?
[0:57:00] <%Wrashis> crisis core is certainly crisis core but what did you think of the turks girl they added, what was her name? what a memorable character. but i remember liking her. @AngriestPat
[0:57:02] <InugamiTheHound> remember when reno and Rude become comic relief characters in advent children?
[0:57:07] <%MyDarkStorm> Oh god I just remembered Cait sith LB
[0:57:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Oh boy did I.
[0:57:15] <Thalchampz> Reno is just Axel from KH in AC
[0:57:19] <ScreamLord> Oh no, some dude with a pipe!
[0:57:23] <natebud> I don't know why, but I made Barrett the healer first time I played.
[0:57:25] <SleepyMaribo> @Nedlin i think so
[0:57:29] <Nekros4442> I hope they stay as comic relief tbh.
[0:57:31] <$jobbedbone> foreverially trapped in a pyramid. Fully stuck and loving it
[0:57:34] <+HeyBoston> bop
[0:57:35] <Fien111> @Frost_Quill Yeah....they did....who's the good guys again?
[0:57:37] <Ion_Laser> A cattle prod
[0:57:39] <mankeyfigh> @inugamithehound They already are comic-relief
[0:57:41] <%vaporousTippler> Barret's cast animation is unreasonably awesome.
[0:57:43] <WhereIsWill> stun baton
[0:57:44] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> later fuckers
[0:57:47] <%yet_another_brony> coward

[0:57:49] <%starotter70> Which theme is better Turks or Cosmo Canyon?
[0:57:50] <%Ilpala> WOOPWOOPWOOP
[0:57:52] <reonome> wow reno looks uglier than I remember
[0:57:52] <+HeyBoston> good job knuckles
[0:57:54] <hippieofdeath> YOU DIDN'T WIN!!
[0:57:58] <%Edgy_Macaroon> baton?
[0:58:09] <%razielhex> @AngriestPat It's one of those neutral sticks from Demolition Man
[0:58:10] <%XzileGaming> Clumbo gonna clumb.
[0:58:11] <natebud> Look at this loser reno, doesn't want to explode.
[0:58:11] <SummonerMagno> time 2 hack
[0:58:12] <Dementedpenguin> Reno: one button push Knuckle: millions of button presses.
[0:58:13] <MetroidSlayerP7> Give 'em the stick--Don't give 'em the stick!!
[0:58:14] <%GabeSweetMan> A quantum time bomb?
[0:58:16] <Thalchampz> SourPls
[0:58:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's Abby something or other.
[0:58:20] <MoonObscure> -snpas fingers-
[0:58:22] <mayorrev> Thats right Jay
[0:58:22] <Koosahmii> Oof. Reno’s model...
[0:58:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> I always get my party members high on hypers so they always have fury and get more limit breaks
[0:58:24] <Baconrath> jc a bomb

[0:58:36] <%manwithboxonhead> Ah yes the Pimp Turk.
[0:58:37] <+reknownblackcat> @AngriestPat stop enjoying that music right now!
[0:58:38] <InugamiTheHound> @starotter70 the great warrior aka seto's theme is really good
[0:58:40] <SleepyMaribo> Tseng is a asshole
[0:58:41] <%nmaten> which one?
[0:58:41] <%Frost_Quill> @Fien111 I like how this makes Shinra framing them make sense. Of course people are going to think the people who killed hundreds of people in terror attacks would be responsible for the latest terror attack.
[0:58:42] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> i keep hearing the teamfourstar voices
[0:58:44] <+Zerodyne90> rgt420
[0:58:45] <mayorrev> nice aim
[0:58:46] <Nekros4442> .....why arent you dead yet Tseng
[0:58:49] <+Tokanova> he keeps missing!
[0:58:51] <disflipmat> This is especially fucked up because Tseng and Aeris are kinda friends

[0:59:09] <%vaporousTippler> Barret's racking up the renegade points.
[0:59:09] <%manwithboxonhead> I would do anything for Ass4dayz

[0:59:16] <SleepyMaribo> What are you gonna do with Ass4Dayz?
[0:59:17] <InugamiTheHound> Tseng and Elena were faked dead in AC movie
[0:59:18] <%AdmiralButtloaf> Final Fantasy pullets only sting a bit
[0:59:20] <MassConnect> isn't day Z a game or somethign?

[0:59:40] <Basch71> I guess Tseng is an ass man Kappa
[0:59:42] <%Frost_Quill> @Nekros4442 They gotta go through the Shinra building first.
[0:59:42] <Louie_Salmon> Man, I wonder what they're gonna do with this scene in the remake.

[1:00:06] <ovan20> How did Barret misssed a helicopter 10 meters away? DansGame
[1:00:11] <Fien111> @Frost_Quill Barret's kind of a stupid asshole when you come down to it. He has ZERO plan, just "THEY KILL PLANET, BLOW UP NAO!"
[1:00:11] <+Tokanova> SourPls

[1:00:25] <%dheng1> The recoil was too much for barret
[1:00:25] <Dementedpenguin> dead
[1:00:27] <%starotter70> How are they going to show this in the remake?
[1:00:29] <%NovaKnightmare> Tons of people deaaaaaaad

[1:00:38] <ovan20> TERRORISM! YAY!
[1:00:39] <%Deano8817> oh
[1:00:40] <natebud> @starotter70 better
[1:00:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> that tv shot always fucked me up
[1:00:43] <mankeyfigh> BARRETT DIDNT SKIP ARM DAY SUCKERS
[1:00:44] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Y'know Cloud and the gang hade just as much leverage as Tseng did because they could have just threatened to blow it up right then and there and take him with them if he didn't disarm it
[1:00:45] <Zebroneath> That wire must be cartoonishly long to span the entire plate.
[1:00:46] <%vaporousTippler> Imagine all the 9999s popping up all over the city.
[1:00:47] <Basch71> and everyone still likes the Turks
[1:00:50] <MistahMrMatt> yo i forgot that was straight fucked up
[1:00:51] <Desertfishing> luckily that gate was open
[1:00:51] <%juxtest> No school tomorrow!
[1:00:51] <hippieofdeath> Ad everyone died. The end.
[1:00:52] <InugamiTheHound> god damn that is fucked up shit!
[1:00:53] <+LandOfTheWay> how many fucking people lived in that sector?
[1:00:55] <+Tokanova> why aren't their massive protests after this?
[1:00:57] <%manwithboxonhead> Yep and ountless innocent lives died.
[1:00:59] <%Frost_Quill> So how many people did AVALANCHE actually kill by blowing up the two reactors?
[1:00:59] <%NovaKnightmare> fuck u shinra
[1:01:00] <+Tokanova> shouldn't the entire city be up in arms?
[1:01:02] <%Starlight_Gamer> what about the people living on the plate?
[1:01:02] <%Owkono> overkill
[1:01:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> FOR THE PLANET
[1:01:04] <+Tokanova> like holy shit
[1:01:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> YEAH
[1:01:05] <%manwithboxonhead> *countless
[1:01:06] <+Enteshas> just another slice of life LUL
[1:01:06] <mayorrev> You did this
[1:01:07] <%Deano8817> Looks like Avalanche got avalanched Kappa
[1:01:07] <%yet_another_brony> its fiiine
[1:01:11] <zamzoph> those poor people on top of the plate BibleThump
[1:01:13] <%XzileGaming> shuck you finra
[1:01:13] <Fien111> They blame it on AVALANCHE, guys
[1:01:14] <hippieofdeath> Ecoterrorism yay!!
[1:01:14] <mayorrev> GARFIELD
[1:01:15] <Dementedpenguin> thousands of people died, and he's nonchalantly staring down at it.
[1:01:16] <%RupanSen> 20 at least
[1:01:19] <mankeyfigh> Classic PRESIDENT MUSIC
[1:01:24] <Desertfishing> nah everyone lived
[1:01:26] <spinalwizard> Hate to be the guy who was crushed by the giant light
[1:01:28] <Parapattern> Why would you build it like that?
[1:01:28] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Y'know Cloud and the gang had just as much leverage as Tseng did because they could have just threatened to blow it up right then and there and take him with them if he didn't disarm it
[1:01:29] <mayorrev> garfield slide garfield slide
[1:01:30] <%supersugoisenpai1> Didn't even kill any AVALANCHE members, Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie were already dead or dying
[1:01:33] <HollowMan190> our heros?
[1:01:37] <natebud> Man I can't wait to befriend Reno later.
[1:01:40] <ovan20> that got dark really fast monkaS
[1:01:41] <%Keyd00d> They're fine, I can see their parachutes
[1:01:44] <mayorrev> BibleThump
[1:01:44] <InugamiTheHound> oh the park is all messed up
[1:01:47] <$jobbedbone> but the planet tho
[1:01:47] <%dheng1> Big heroes well done
[1:01:50] <+HeyBoston> oh they're super dead bro
[1:01:51] <reonome> F
[1:01:54] <zamzoph> they're fine
[1:01:54] <+SuperBloodWolfMoon> It's 1/8(?) the population of the largest city on the planet.
[1:01:55] <%This_is_Marco> are we the baddies?
[1:01:55] <%GabeSweetMan> It's overkill and it's literally pointless.
[1:01:56] <%Owkono> sense materia below the slide
[1:01:59] <+Tokanova> it was like 9/11 x 10
[1:02:02] <%AdmiralButtloaf> 7/11 was an inside job
[1:02:03] <%templar010> What was it all for..
[1:02:04] <%happyface699> Big bad
[1:02:05] <%Starlight_Gamer> LUL
[1:02:06] <%happyface699> apatBig
[1:02:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> We just cut down the emissons of this city by an 8th! FOR THE PLANET
[1:02:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> your own anger took them Chewie.
[1:02:09] <Tucker0603> is the kid died?
[1:02:09] <%wjones0415> so, they killed thousands just to rout a terrorist group?
[1:02:09] <Nekros4442> @Tokanova I'd say alot more than 10 lol
[1:02:10] <Xalgar> Barret BibleThump
[1:02:10] <%nmaten> cmon man only millions of people died cause you suck
[1:02:11] <ミュウレ4242> he'll get that football one day.
[1:02:12] <HollowMan190> why is he reading like thst it's scarying me stop it
[1:02:12] <Desertfishing> i don't see any bodies so they can't be claimed dead or aliva
[1:02:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Your lust for vengeance.
[1:02:13] <%Deano8817> boy that's gonna hurt to look at in the remake
[1:02:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AdmiralButtloaf part time job
[1:02:20] <%gespenst25> why are we still here? just to suffer?
[1:02:23] <%Frost_Quill> "Sector 7 was an inside job."
[1:02:25] <%manwithboxonhead> SHOOT THE RUBBLE
[1:02:25] <+Zerodyne90> LUL
[1:02:29] <Aydarkzero> this part on the remake is going to be crazy
[1:02:29] <mayorrev> :(
[1:02:30] <Nekros4442> @Tokanova This is the equivalent of like an 8th of a city just being blown up
[1:02:31] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat Ever shoot your gun in the air and go "aaaaaagh"?
[1:02:31] <spinalwizard> and..... you shot the survivors
[1:02:32] <%juxtest> And they still only killed half of them
[1:02:32] <InugamiTheHound> where does he get all the bullets for his arm
[1:02:34] <$jobbedbone> @SuperBloodWolfMoon wouldn't the rich slices of the pizza have a lower population?
[1:02:35] <+Tokanova> "bro just calm down, i know all our friends died but chill"
[1:02:35] <%GabeSweetMan> Best Dad
[1:02:36] <T3merity> someone crawling out of the rubble probably just got shot up by Barrett
[1:02:37] <hippieofdeath> Gonna shoot this rubble, that'll mak eit right
[1:02:41] <SleepyMaribo> i want everyone to take in the fact that they killed thousands to kill 6 people....
[1:02:41] <%razielhex> @wjones0415 Standard foreign policy here in the US.
[1:02:41] <%starotter70> Chewie's had it rough
[1:02:42] <+BigCoffee> >thousands They killed hundreds of thousands
[1:02:46] <mayorrev> ASS4DAYZ
[1:02:46] <%Frost_Quill> "Jet fuel can't melt sector plates."
[1:02:48] <Dementedpenguin> in a children's playground to to drive home the point >_>
[1:02:48] <$BoundlessBroadcast> Man I haven't seen this game since I played the demo for it ages ago.
[1:02:53] <%nmaten> stop censoring ass4dayz
[1:02:54] <+EatinEden> Good to see that slide made it
[1:02:54] <Everdarke> Fire materia can't melt steel beams
[1:02:58] <%starotter70> Who's Aerith?
[1:02:59] <natebud> Avalanche was so damn effective that they assumed it was a bigger threat than it was I guess.
[1:03:00] <ScreamLord> Tens of Thousands. Millions even dead
[1:03:01] <+Tokanova> clumbos so dumb
[1:03:01] <%XzileGaming> that slide is one photoshop edit away from a silent hill monster
[1:03:07] <%yet_another_brony> whats the point of a name like ass4dayz of youre still going to say aerith
[1:03:10] <+SuperBloodWolfMoon> @jobbedbone Yeah, but it'd still be 1/8 of the rich people and 1/8 of the poor people.
[1:03:13] <%vaporousTippler> They got Avalanched.
[1:03:15] <%manwithboxonhead> Their dead for good, don't worry they won't come back as the undead
[1:03:19] <$philoboy123> They do have a 1st Class Soldier with them. He would pose a great problem
[1:03:19] <SummonerMagno> we make diamonds of tehir ashes
[1:03:19] <spinalwizard> Yes
[1:03:20] <%segonian> sector 7 was an inside job
[1:03:21] <nehaerys> YES
[1:03:23] <Nekros4442> Yes....
[1:03:23] <Parapattern> We really goobered it up this time, Chewie
[1:03:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> YES
[1:03:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> you are terrorist GROUP
[1:03:27] <%happyface699> PASTE
[1:03:27] <%Frost_Quill> I mean they already lost their lives BEFORE this Chewie.
[1:03:32] <Nekros4442> You are legit eco-terrorists
[1:03:34] <zamzoph> Moral of the story: don't be a terrorist
[1:03:38] <mayorrev> its the goddamn shinra's fault
[1:03:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> No, you guys. It's cause of you.
[1:03:50] <%Ninestempest> the big evil
[1:03:50] <mankeyfigh> YES
[1:03:51] <dickbuttwoman> Even the sonic comic figured that one out
[1:03:51] <+michingmallecho> Ahhhh....AVALANCHE
[1:03:53] <+Tokanova> this was REALLY extreme
[1:03:54] <Ion_Laser> Should have had a backup base
[1:03:59] <%wjones0415> what did you think you were doing when you blew up plants, asshole!
[1:03:59] <Xalgar> @Nekros4442 But Shinra are BIGGER eco terrorists LUL
[1:04:04] <dickbuttwoman> Freedom fighter HQ is intentionally away from the city
[1:04:07] <%nmaten> no! not the corporate evil (tm)
[1:04:08] <%starotter70> But weren't they stuck in the city?
[1:04:11] <+Tokanova> like they could have deployed the whole shinra army to hunt down avalanche but instead they like... went for the nuclear option?
[1:04:11] <%supersugoisenpai1> Frank Castle once threatened to nuke a country to get one guy
[1:04:12] <%XzileGaming> shuck finra
[1:04:12] <+barkon345> ECO Terrorism is Awesome
[1:04:13] <mayorrev> it's shinra's fault that i didn't pay my taxes on time
[1:04:13] <%RupanSen> shoot the planed Barret
[1:04:15] <@lewdskeletor13> Hmmmm this game has some subtle political commentary
[1:04:15] <spinalwizard> MY EMOTIONS
[1:04:16] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat still blowing up a city to kill a small group of people is way overkill
[1:04:17] <%juxtest> We gotta find a bigger Midgar and DROP IT on this Midgar! That'll show 'em!
[1:04:17] <%Frost_Quill> Actually having it be IN the city would have been good if Shinra weren't evil fucks. They could have painted the people of sector 7 as hostages if they wanted to.
[1:04:17] <%yet_another_brony> ughh feelings
[1:04:20] <%templar010> "Whatever"
[1:04:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> You're technically the villains in this game.
[1:04:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> Clumbo does what Clumbo do
[1:04:24] <Nekros4442> @Xalgar not wrong, just alot of eco-terrorism up in here
[1:04:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Xalgar Shinra just cut down the emssions of the city by and 8th
[1:04:31] <InugamiTheHound> fuck Shell and BP!! We gotta destroy them and save the planet
[1:04:33] <Fien111> directionless terrorism got us into this and directionless terrorism can get us out!
[1:04:40] <Valdorick> I feel like Berret runs into the Freya problem - his story ends just after the first act.
[1:04:44] <natebud> In WWII the Nazis blew up half of occupied Marseille because they assumed there were partisans there.
[1:04:44] <%XzileGaming> but wait, he isnt dead, CLUMBO SURPRISE
[1:04:46] <blackorchidKI2> Knew he would say that
[1:04:49] <Dementedpenguin> I mean.... after thousands killed, it's kinda hard to turn back >_>
[1:04:50] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Isn't just a barren wasteland outside the city walls? Not a lot of places to make a hidden base in
[1:04:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> SourPls
[1:05:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> cue getting lost music
[1:05:04] <+Tokanova> in my head barett sounds like a mix of big smoke from gtaSA and mr T
[1:05:05] <hippieofdeath> Look at the bright side, now that they're part of the lifestream there's more mako to power our dystopia!
[1:05:11] <Baconrath> isnt this the area with the Hell House PogChamp
[1:05:17] <%manwithboxonhead> what...
[1:05:20] <+Tokanova> all ya had to do was follow the damn train ya couldn't get off CJlumbo
[1:05:21] <Nekros4442> @ScreamLord there's a couple places but I forget if there's enough livable places immediately outside Midgar
[1:05:26] <@lewdskeletor13> One minute your cross dressing, the next you’re killing thousands. Stuff happens!
[1:05:27] <%Frost_Quill> So are Shinra Al-Bhed considering they're the descendants of X's Shinra?
[1:05:32] <Xalgar> @Baconrath Yup LUL
[1:05:34] <%vaporousTippler> Jessie's going to be powering a light bulb in no time.
[1:05:36] <%Frost_Quill> Would Wakka be all over AVALANCHE?
[1:05:37] <Desertfishing> man i can't wait to see how this looks in the remake
[1:05:37] <%dheng1> Is cloud trippin balls the whole time ?

[1:06:24] <Dementedpenguin> in a silly way
[1:06:24] <T3merity> they need to put this house on double secret probation PRONTO

[1:07:17] <%manwithboxonhead> The first vampire Caine I know.
[1:07:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is that because their limit breaks can hit multiple times?
[1:07:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> Kain Highwind vs Cid Highwind
[1:07:18] <hippieofdeath> Kane
[1:07:20] <%Starlight_Gamer> what?
[1:07:21] <Thalchampz> Cucklord

[1:07:34] <$BoundlessBroadcast> Ah yes, the crossover Command and Conquer and Final Fantasy lore we all wanted
[1:07:37] <%starotter70> @mayorrev Yup
[1:07:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> yang is still ded
[1:07:38] <%Kenori> Ah yes, the Undertakers Brother Kane

[1:07:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ya gotta name him Kain now then
[1:07:46] <%wjones0415> actually, barrett's hits 10 times while tifas hits 7.
[1:07:46] <ミュウレ4242> i always just rolled the bests available harem. usually tifa and yuffie.
[1:07:46] <%Frost_Quill> @mayorrev Yuffie is missable and Vincent is actually kinda hidden.

[1:08:42] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat Aren’t there parts of the game when certain characters are locked, so you need to bring them all to cap?

[1:08:53] <JoeNeutrino> Extra materia is totally unecessary.
[1:08:56] <%Frost_Quill> This is totally in-line with AVALANCHE's previous behavior so it was SUPER easy to frame them.

[1:09:03] <$BoundlessBroadcast> @goose_attack_almanac well yeah. Survival of the fittest
[1:09:06] <Nekros4442> @mankeyfigh There's not many cases where 3 characters that you're using are locked

[1:37:15] <natebud> That's not rude, that's tifa
[1:37:15] <chad_irl> Better blow up the building to get rid of the evil Shinra staircase.
[1:37:16] <mayorrev> IT WAS ACCEPTABLE IN THE 90s monkaS

[1:37:32] <%manwithboxonhead> I missed that part
[1:37:33] <%Deano8817> aand back down
[1:37:36] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat DAMNIT I just thought of a better name you could have given Tifa! Knipples!
[1:37:36] <Valdorick> It'll be there for the remake - RATED M FOR SAYING A BAD WORD
[1:37:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> Tifa's ass could crush diamonds after this.
[1:37:38] <JoeNeutrino> Can't provoke the ire of the outrage addicts.
[1:37:40] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat they'll probly replace that with "dumbass" if they wanna be simple
[1:37:41] <%Kyma1020> It’ll be a cutscene most likely
[1:37:43] <@lewdskeletor13> Simmer down
[1:37:44] <Futurecity10> I recently watched the MGS4 watch through and matt and pat dropped the R word constantly. I miss those days
[1:37:46] <$BoundlessBroadcast> @ScreamLord that's amazing
[1:37:49] <Louie_Salmon> No, it'll be there, but then everyone will stop and sit Tifa down to explain why she shouldn't use that word
[1:37:50] <kingdomfan0> @AngriestPat are you going to bother with stealing for cloud's sword in Shinra HQ?
[1:37:56] <Xalgar> Twitter once again ruining the internet LUL
[1:37:57] <%Chocolatevgz> Thank you Pat, on behalf of my 3+ family members with that actual condition. Thank you. :3
[1:38:03] <%QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> god I hope it isn't
[1:38:06] <The_Cysquatch> I suppose he was slowing down their progress.
[1:38:06] <mercado94> a censored cutscene
[1:38:08] <Desertfishing> check the tv in the shop
[1:38:10] <%Deano8817> imagine the terrorists climb up 20 flights of stairs just to take the elevator back down

[1:39:14] <Valdorick> Das a bitch ge'nade
[1:39:17] <%Chocolatevgz> The robot with the spike ball under him have carbon bangles
[1:39:20] <shinichizio> We can't start a commotion.
[1:39:30] <SleepyMaribo> my first time playing this game, i went from lvl 13 to 30 in this place lol
[1:39:44] <%Chocolatevgz> This tower has the best named armor in the game: FOUR SLOTS
[1:39:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> So...I assume he doesn't care about the stat boost items then?
[1:39:57] <red_blaster> You can open those when you come back
[1:40:00] <%starotter70> I only played this game recently and the motorcycle shit is still the coolest!
[1:40:04] <%supersugoisenpai1> We don't deal with your kind
[1:40:04] <+Shaggnar> LUL
[1:40:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> 🤔
[1:40:11] <%Chocolatevgz> Shut up, Chewie, we want the money.
[1:40:12] <red_blaster> I think you can see a video on that TV
[1:40:12] <mankeyfigh> @chocolatevgz it’s growth and defense is crap tho, too bad
[1:40:15] <knightmatty21> why does an evil corporation have a gift shop
[1:40:16] <%manwithboxonhead> We dont want your money we are JUSTICE!
[1:40:18] <red_blaster> Check the TV
[1:40:19] <Desertfishing> check the tv for a cut scene
[1:40:19] <Valdorick> "We here to cast Flare on the main support beams of this building!"
[1:40:20] <gerahwar> We are Terrorists not criminals! GET IT RIGHT...wait
[1:40:21] <ranarath> We're terrorists, not criminals!
[1:40:22] <%arcaderabbit48> WE EXPLICITLY ARE
[1:40:22] <%Chocolatevgz> FOUR SLUTS
[1:40:23] <Zebylth> @AngriestPat check tv
[1:40:30] <$BoundlessBroadcast> @knightmatty21 gotta keep the foot soldiers happy
[1:40:32] <megaman_sentinel> the tv
[1:40:32] <%averyoddjew> Let's give the people we're trying to stop our money. That'll show em
[1:40:33] <%Chocolatevgz> Did he miss the turtle
[1:40:36] <EuropanLamprey> Yes, announce your presence while your in the enemy base, what can go wrong?
[1:40:38] <%yet_another_brony> coulda gotten free shit
[1:40:41] <%Estuko> the overlay for the stream is super rad
[1:40:41] <%Chocolatevgz> That's a nice truck, hmm
[1:40:46] <red_blaster> Check the TV in the shop
[1:40:49] <%logoth_> Remember to steal Hard Edge from Soldier 3rd Class enemy
[1:41:03] <%Chocolatevgz> The idea of a three wheel truck was so foreign to me
[1:41:06] <%Chocolatevgz> I thought it was sci-fi
[1:41:17] <Valdorick> ^
[1:41:19] <%Chocolatevgz> But that's a thing
[1:41:20] <%supersugoisenpai1> I always learn new stuff about this game
[1:41:22] <natebud> That's the best part about getting senile.
[1:41:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Gotta love an energy company that arms its security personnel with assault weapons
[1:41:26] <alrobot2014> wait that's a thing?
[1:41:26] <%starotter70> There's SO MUCH
[1:41:31] <+Andrizzleton> did Pat get the Platinum Bangle in the last room?
[1:41:32] <+faithless_zealot> Yeah, makes me a bit nostalgic about some older games as well
[1:41:32] <disflipmat> I only know that three wheeled trucks are a thing because of the Tuk Tuks in Burnout 3
[1:41:38] <shinichizio> Same
[1:41:39] <%Chocolatevgz> We're not that far off from this future, don't worry, lads
[1:41:41] <%Estuko> FeelsGoodMan playing opera omnia final fantasy and I'm able to have aerith and zack on my team.
[1:41:50] <gerahwar> You stole a Mohawk Gernade!
[1:41:56] <InugamiTheHound> That truck they stole was so weird to me until i found out over there in japan they have trucks that open doors like that
[1:42:06] <%Chocolatevgz> If you're grinding to find the enemies to steal from they only appear on certain floors
[1:42:10] <disflipmat> Pat I can't tell from the stream, is this running at 60fps?
[1:42:11] <%logoth_> Ive never seen this
[1:42:12] <%Chocolatevgz> SREPC
[1:42:16] <%razielhex> Look at our cool cars & concept art
[1:42:18] <%starotter70> YO WHAT

[1:42:21] <shinichizio> SREPCMM
[1:42:23] <knightmatty21> wow whats this
[1:42:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Look up the Reliant Robin car. Its a fucking deathtrap
[1:42:24] <Xalgar> SourPls Good Music is comin
[1:42:25] <$BoundlessBroadcast> that car looks safe for rolling over
[1:42:27] <%supersugoisenpai1> Why would you use such ominous music in your commercial
[1:42:27] <ranarath> Woah, I've never seen this cutscene.
[1:42:27] <gerahwar> I never saw this
[1:42:29] <%ColonelRozum> PogChamp
[1:42:30] <+Aworie> what version of this are you playing?
[1:42:32] <%NovaKnightmare> YOOO
[1:42:35] <InugamiTheHound> so steam punk
[1:42:35] <ExpressNode> Finally beat bloodstained and there is this weird high pitched fuzz in the ending sequence. Did anyone else get that or is that a bug?
[1:42:36] <+millionstabz> WTF I never saw this
[1:42:36] <natebud> They're all Morgans
[1:42:37] <%GabeSweetMan> Probably because they have.
[1:42:38] <%starotter70> @Aworie Switch
[1:42:38] <+StrawberryPantsu> They have
[1:42:39] <%logoth_> DRIVER ONLY BIG SEDAN
[1:42:39] <MasterDecoder> @Aworie Switch
[1:42:40] <transporterthesequel> That's because they were!
[1:42:40] <%manwithboxonhead> I never seen this before
[1:42:40] <disflipmat> They look like Soviet DIY cars
[1:42:42] <%razielhex> This cutscene wwas on the original PS1 Version
[1:42:43] <%Chocolatevgz> Some of these cars look like they belong in FF6 Steampunk land
[1:42:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> Diesel Punk
[1:42:43] <AmericanaRed> BUY
[1:42:44] <reinbachthe3rd> Some ghetto-ass steampunk shit.
[1:42:47] <shinichizio> Mirror the words, because why the fuck not
[1:42:47] <+Tokanova> why is this a cutscene
[1:42:48] <+Aworie> oh ok thank you :)
[1:42:48] <%averyoddjew> that's a sedan? wtf
[1:42:48] <Desertfishing> i wonder if something like this could be hidden away in the remake
[1:42:49] <+Atomik456> it was the 90s cyber future
[1:42:49] <jonasislike> I super don’t remember this wtf???
[1:42:49] <%arcaderabbit48> They probably were!
[1:42:51] <%QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> driver only BIG sedan
[1:42:54] <thetyrantcbass> Make those cars mounts in 14 holy shit
[1:42:55] <CrystalSlimeV> Driver only big sedan
[1:42:57] <%Starlight_Gamer> this theme wants me to buy the car
[1:42:57] <%Estuko> That's a SEXY ass car commercial LUL
[1:42:59] <+millionstabz> Is this if you go in the front?
[1:43:00] <%Chocolatevgz> Makou engine
[1:43:02] <MetroidSlayerP7> Gotta love that 90’s high tech look
[1:43:04] <%GarbageNirvana> "ShinRa: Ignore the music, we're totally not evil, we promise"
[1:43:06] <knightmatty21> this is so cool
[1:43:07] <xeros720> they got a "boy scout derby" quality to them
[1:43:07] <AmericanaRed> WHEEL MOVES BUY
[1:43:08] <gerahwar> "WE have maths!"
[1:43:08] <natebud> Why does it have a piston if it's electric?
[1:43:08] <$BoundlessBroadcast> "It has wheels! and turns them too!"
[1:43:10] <Valdorick> Mako Powered Cars
[1:43:10] <%AbnormalVoid> I love this dumb commercial
[1:43:15] <Dementedpenguin> 90s cgi cutscenes were the best
[1:43:16] <%logoth_> That was a good amazon commercial
[1:43:17] <Xalgar> Wait is has a Mako generator inside it?
[1:43:20] <%razielhex> It's such a dumb easter egg thing too
[1:43:23] <Valdorick> "Just run it off nuclear power"
[1:43:24] <%Chocolatevgz> Of course
[1:43:25] <ranarath> Makou Engines
[1:43:27] <%starotter70> I'm glad it plays the evil music throughout the whole thing
[1:43:29] <%razielhex> @Xalgar Like Fallout cars; nuclear engines
[1:43:29] <disflipmat> If this game came out two years later we'd have had a Shinra URL at the end
[1:43:29] <%Chocolatevgz> Just like Space Pirates and Phazon
[1:43:30] <%GabeSweetMan> They might as well be powered by blood.
[1:43:31] <+SuperBloodWolfMoon> I just realized ShinRa Electric Company is ShREC.
[1:43:32] <%ShichiNoBushi> It's as if this sinister music is actually the in universe theme music for Shinra.
[1:43:33] <%Chocolatevgz> They put it in everything
[1:43:34] <Koosahmii> I get the impression they really wanted a racing section in the game
[1:43:37] <Meowshi> Rufus is so cool
[1:43:41] <%GabeSweetMan> It's not ogre....
[1:43:44] <InugamiTheHound> Nuclear engine cars reminds me of fallout games
[1:43:47] <natebud> These are 1-cylinder electric cars
[1:43:48] <+Andrizzleton> That's the lifeblood of the planet FOO!
[1:43:51] <Ghostfaceninja53534> just got here, did he go thru the front?
[1:43:52] <disflipmat> Check yourself before you ShREC yourself
[1:43:56] <ScreamLord> I kinda wish we still got unique car designs like you see from the 50s and back.
[1:44:01] <%Shackle_Rustyford> is this pre snek
[1:44:01] <Valdorick> Nuclear engine cars remind me of the real nuclear cars the 50s wanted to make >.>
[1:44:01] <@lewdskeletor13> You know what they say about the Al Ahbed brudda
[1:44:02] <%QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> but those were just dudes, not power armor
[1:44:09] <%radda343> those guys were robits the whole time
[1:44:12] <%Chocolatevgz> it does have a racing mini-game, just doesn't have cars lol
[1:44:14] <+Atomik456> robocops
[1:44:20] <ranarath> @Ghostfaceninja53534 Went through stairs then back down to do front.
[1:44:21] <Xalgar> @razielhex But like, how do you refuel it? If Shinra have to keep pumping out Mako in reactors, how do you bring that to a gas station? LUL
[1:44:22] <%logoth_> Ed 209s
[1:44:22] <%razielhex> @Valdorick Hence fallout cars were fusion engines and made gigantic mushroom clouds
[1:44:23] <gerahwar> Look at these IRON MEN
[1:44:24] <%Shackle_Rustyford> mad props for pat not just pushing the auto win button
[1:44:36] <$BoundlessBroadcast> @Xalgar drones
[1:44:38] <%Chocolatevgz> I dunno what's the storage medium for Mako?
[1:44:41] <%razielhex> @Xalgar The upper crust who could afford the cars would have mako refueling stations
[1:44:41] <%manwithboxonhead> EXO_SUIT!
[1:44:46] <%Chocolatevgz> Is it a gas? liquid?
[1:44:49] <mankeyfigh> Double defense
[1:44:50] <AmericanaRed> ROBOT GHOST
[1:44:52] <%supersugoisenpai1> Hardedge guys are up near Hojo's lab
[1:45:04] <%Estuko> the somersault move is so satiisfying to pull off in dissidia PogChamp
[1:45:06] <%razielhex> @Xalgar Either that or they're literally powered by reactors that last for 10 years before going supercritical
[1:45:06] <$BoundlessBroadcast> what's with the moonwalking robots
[1:45:07] <%Chocolatevgz> It's worth it to steal at random sometimes tho
[1:45:09] <%manwithboxonhead> Exo-suit
[1:45:15] <disflipmat> Mako's just Lifestream, so it's a liquid but they can heat it into a gas for the fuel injection system in cars
[1:45:19] <+Itselguapo> Yo I forgot about these roller blading robot things
[1:45:19] <shinichizio> Wait, those robots were wearing robots!
[1:45:20] <$jobbedbone> naked robots :)
[1:45:24] <Xalgar> @razielhex Shinra making jobs PogChamp
[1:45:24] <%logoth_> There's an enemy I forget that has a really good bangle
[1:45:30] <%Chocolatevgz> So it's just petrol with souls in it? sweet
[1:45:31] <gerahwar> Yes and no
[1:45:36] <%Big_Dream> no its a robot
[1:45:37] <Kingdom_65> So what made you wanna play FF7, Pat?
[1:45:42] <%supersugoisenpai1> Cast lightning on it and see
[1:45:47] <+Itselguapo> These designs better stay in FF7 Remake
[1:45:47] <disflipmat> Yeah, mako is literally oil but made up of souls
[1:45:47] <+fingalights> Biobot
[1:45:50] <Ghostfaceninja53534> did he go thru the front or back?
[1:45:55] <AmericanaRed> 69
[1:46:03] <$BoundlessBroadcast> cheer100 because I have these bits and don't have a use for them
[1:46:04] <%Chocolatevgz> stairs
[1:46:06] <Kingdom_65> Ah, I see.
[1:46:07] <%starotter70> Goota get to 69
[1:46:08] <%dheng1> I think those robots give you hardedge
[1:46:08] <Xalgar> @razielhex But yeah, that has to be how it works
[1:46:09] <$jobbedbone> what if the dark souls were oil the whole time
[1:46:09] <$BoundlessBroadcast> cheer100 because I have these bits and don't have a use for them
[1:46:12] <revzero25> Has pat tried the remako mod
[1:46:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's basically like Doom, they made reactors out of the afterlife.
[1:46:15] <%Chocolatevgz> I like this scene
[1:46:15] <Ghostfaceninja53534> ty choco
[1:46:15] <Kingdom_65> I'm probably gonna do that too but closer to the release
[1:46:15] <gerahwar> Now you need to heat the card key in order to activate the metal gear! ...wait
[1:46:19] <%Chocolatevgz> not necessary but fun
[1:46:20] <HollowMan190> the game won't be finshed till 2034
[1:46:24] <ranarath> Can't wait to see ol' eye boob.
[1:46:25] <Valdorick> These transitions are so fucking rad
[1:46:25] <%radda343> that transition blew my babby mind
[1:46:26] <%logoth_> Monitor duty has to be the worst job in the world
[1:46:26] <ExpressNode> I need to finish FF7 too
[1:46:31] <%manwithboxonhead> BECAUSE SOME guard slept on the job.
[1:46:36] <%Chocolatevgz> I don't even know what you're talking about but I fucking love Eye Boob
[1:46:39] <typocursedramona> having never played ff7 should i just wait for the remake, or actually get around to playing the original?
[1:46:40] <%GarbageNirvana> So we're not playing past this segment since that's all they're covering in the remake, right
[1:46:42] <natebud> I have never done this right
[1:46:45] <%Chocolatevgz> I'd love monitor duty
[1:46:46] <mankeyfigh> SNEAK TIME
[1:46:48] <%Deano8817> I've still yet to finish a single FF game, and I've tried several times
[1:46:48] <Xalgar> NA Guards LUL
[1:46:49] <disflipmat> I hate this section
[1:47:04] <%logoth_> "stealth"
[1:47:05] <%starotter70> Oh right this part
[1:47:06] <$BoundlessBroadcast> I'm gonna have to crash soon, anybody know the next time that pat and paige are streaming DS2?
[1:47:11] <AmericanaRed> SHHH SNEAKY
[1:47:13] <shinichizio> macawWolfteam Stealth
[1:47:14] <@lewdskeletor13> This is a SNEAKING mission Snake!
[1:47:15] <ranarath> @BoundlessBroadcast Friday
[1:47:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Clumbo, this is a sneaking mission
[1:47:20] <AmericanaRed> SSHH SECRET
[1:47:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> how do they not notice
[1:47:21] <%Chocolatevgz> My dad worked security at a power plant and in the monitor room they'd watch/share pirated movies in downtime
[1:47:21] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I hope these old ass polygon Popeye models will be unlockable costumes in the Remake
[1:47:23] <Valdorick> Stealth? Just Raiden it Kappa
[1:47:27] <%Estuko> monkaS
[1:47:29] <$BoundlessBroadcast> @ranarath thanks; probably later again?
[1:47:30] <Ghostfaceninja53534> sneky snek
[1:47:32] <%Deano8817> Is paige do big sleep or is she off to work again?
[1:47:35] <%Chocolatevgz> I can say that now because he's retired and can't get in trouble now :D
[1:47:36] <%arcaderabbit48> @typocursedramona The remake is going to come out in multiple pieces, so you'll be waiting a while for the full thing. The original is cheap,a nd the remake will be substantially different enough that they're basically different games. So yeah, grab the original on Switch
[1:47:37] <Kingdom_65> @Deano8817 It's understandable, JRPGs can be hard to finish. I still have to finish FF9 and FF10 but I'm lazy.
[1:47:38] <InugamiTheHound> i totally forgot the switch have pro controllers and this entire time I thought you were using a xb1 controller LOL
[1:47:39] <$jobbedbone> with modern tech, and software monitor duty should be trivial
[1:47:39] <%logoth_> Peach feel asleep
[1:47:39] <@lewdskeletor13> She sleeping
[1:47:39] <%MyDarkStorm> Big Boss would be Proud

[1:48:03] <%arcaderabbit48> Why?
[1:48:04] <mankeyfigh> Noice
[1:48:06] <%shadowace2400> they're gonna have to have some kinda cover thing if they plan on putting that into the remake
[1:48:07] <Valdorick> Tactical Rollerblades - Radical 90's action
[1:48:07] <%manwithboxonhead> BOTH SIDES PogChamp
[1:48:09] <$BoundlessBroadcast> @ranarath thanks! Might actually be able to make it then. Stupid work at 7am
[1:48:12] <EuropanLamprey> Ah yes, the real way to play stealth games, kill everything
[1:48:20] <+Atomik456> paige is breaking her back working in the mustard mines
[1:48:28] <Dementedpenguin> oh OH. I forgot you had to start over
[1:48:29] <$BoundlessBroadcast> @Atomik456 and stroking out
[1:48:31] <Xalgar> IT'S SO DUMB that they have to wear rollerblades inside of mech suits LUL
[1:48:40] <Theonlypegsus> Oof
[1:48:41] <%Deano8817> @Kingdom_65 yeaah, I probably could have been able to actually finish ff7 at some point, but I had the pc version and it hard crashed after a certain point so it was impossible for me to go on
[1:48:42] <Psyramics> is the podcast happening tomorrow and are you still streaming tomorrow night if it is?
[1:48:44] <%razielhex> it's mazing you cn afford a living doing this, @AngriestPat

[1:49:37] <Koosahmii> No sinking city?
[1:49:37] <%Yadogari> Yadogari subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Pat you have a pretty amazing stream but you know what's really amazing? The Shin-Ra Model pA-86. The Model pA-86 arrives this year, boasting a 1004cc in line 3 short stroke cylinder and a max speed of 144 kilometers an hour.
[1:49:40] <mankeyfigh> Place your bets on if he makes it past
[1:49:40] <GustauveVIII> if you fail enough times they just stop spawning
[1:49:41] <GustauveVIII> lol

[1:49:53] <%happyface699> Bitch ass robuts
[1:50:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> ez
[1:50:07] <ranarath> @Koosahmii No, he said he wasn't going to stream that anymore
[1:50:09] <Valdorick> Greedy
[1:50:12] <%supersugoisenpai1> Should be more than enough time
[1:50:17] <%arcaderabbit48> You have half a year, you can probably do that

[1:50:17] <%starotter70> LUL
[1:50:18] <didgereedoodah> you just need to beat Midgar

[1:50:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> woopsie doodle
[1:50:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> you could probably knock it out in 7 or so 5 hour streams
[1:50:23] <MetroidSlayerP7> This was “gameplay” back in the day.
[1:50:25] <+TheSaintJohn> so you're putting it all off til the last week of Feb?
[1:50:27] <KaliasTV> We live here now chat

[1:50:29] <EuropanLamprey> Will you even finish this section before March?
[1:50:33] <%Yadogari> Nice way to secretly grind levels Pat
[1:50:33] <shinichizio> Truly pat has reached the anger
[1:50:37] <Hiruzen93> Xp grinding i see
[1:50:43] <KaseKaizer> well I mean at THIS rate..
[1:50:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gameplay back in the day was throwing as many "mini-games" in as possible.
[1:50:48] <tungstenviper> LUL
[1:50:49] <$BoundlessBroadcast> Eventually they'll run out of robots Pat
[1:50:57] <shinichizio> Who said that you'd get mercy if you booched it 3 times in a row
[1:51:08] <disflipmat> @Zaphire_Saucypants FF7 especially had a TON of minigame segments
[1:51:11] <%arcaderabbit48> There's a lot of things I want the remake to have, but the shitty minigames aren't one of them. Stealth is terrible, that wire segment form before is awful, and we haven't even gotten to the fucking dolphin yet
[1:51:14] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> You're getting worse 😂
[1:51:14] <Valdorick> I remember being a kid playing this part at 3AM - they totally run outta robots
[1:51:16] <%manwithboxonhead> Don't fuck up PAt
[1:51:18] <%nmaten> ff 5
[1:51:20] <chronoxgp> pogs
[1:51:22] <alrobot2014> they do give you mercy at some point
[1:51:23] <Ghostfaceninja53534> the timing has to be precise take your time with the last bit
[1:51:27] <Valdorick> Or maybe that was a fever dream...
[1:51:38] <chronoxgp> beyblade
[1:51:40] <disflipmat> Are you gonna keep Fire Emblem to yourself?
[1:51:42] <MetroidSlayerP7> 1 a week is cool
[1:51:42] <mankeyfigh> Outer wilds?
[1:51:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> stealth, CPR, chocobo racing, snowboarding...what am I missing?
[1:51:55] <%starotter70> Don't fuck up
[1:51:58] <$BoundlessBroadcast> I love the little hand wave Cloud does
[1:52:00] <MassConnect> the weird thing about procrastination? why wait until tomorrow when you can start procrastinating today?
[1:52:09] <%supersugoisenpai1> These guards have vision like OG Metal Gear guards
[1:52:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah, the parade
[1:52:15] <%thelaxinator> thelaxinator subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! I'm not sure what's more addictive, getting into the flow with Enochian and spamming Fire 4 as a BLM, or doing Reassemble + Drill as a MCH.
[1:52:15] <%averyoddjew> but what about Metal Wolf?
[1:52:19] <Sokumotanaka> Go golden deer
[1:52:20] <Valdorick> yeyeye Ravendor
[1:52:21] <+Andrizzleton> Golden Deer is best
[1:52:22] <reonome> yeyeyeyeye FE
[1:52:22] <Xalgar> FE has a bullshit difficulty system though
[1:52:23] <disflipmat> Are you doing Edel/Chaos right now?
[1:52:24] <gerahwar> "Remember we're here for Azz4DAYS!"
[1:52:29] <chronoxgp> matt and liam did MWC
[1:52:32] <ExpressNode> I might try Black Eagles my NG+
[1:52:38] <%starotter70> Hard mode isn't too tough until Time Skip
[1:52:46] <%arancet> im loving FE, but while itd be fun to see on stream a bit, a whole run sounds like a bit much
[1:52:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh aaand, that Condor place.

[1:53:15] <Valdorick> That Condor place was so fun for me - I hated that you couldn't go back to it after you got the last reward : /
[1:53:16] <%Kenori> You have to heat the key
[1:53:22] <chronoxgp> what is the dragon quest movie??
[1:53:27] <disflipmat> This security system is bullshit
[1:53:30] <$BoundlessBroadcast> @chronoxgp it's exactly what it sounds like
[1:53:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> man, this top down view sure makes that person you're flirting with super hot
[1:53:39] <%Kenori> It is SHOCKING how little of the world Shinra ACTUALLY controls
[1:53:40] <mankeyfigh> Stairs
[1:53:40] <%arcaderabbit48> @Zaphire_Saucypants There's a bunch of mini-minigames too. Like proto-QTEs. The wire form before, there's a dolphin you have to jump off of later, stuff like that
[1:53:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nu nu, heat the key, then cool it.
[1:53:42] <%Kenori> Less than you'd think
[1:53:42] <%Anonymasque> Yes.... SAFE
[1:53:43] <leargo> so safe
[1:53:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> are they a man or woman, who cares

[2:00:16] <+ryosuke91kc> this puzzle is a little confusing. you gotta find out what category the room is and find out which book doesnt belong. then use the number to indicate which letter of that book is the clue

[2:03:22] <%SirGO0SE> awww hes probably trying to eat it all up
[2:03:22] <%Anonymasque> Kiwami means barf

[2:03:44] <leargo> poor kitty
[2:03:51] <%Lithdoran> This need for revenge...WHO?!
[2:04:04] <%SirGO0SE> throwup is elmos 3rd favorite food after hair and misery
[2:04:12] <%Faustgesicht> ohno i missed elmo barf?
[2:04:24] <%Lithdoran> barfmo
[2:04:28] <ranarath> it wasn't actually on stream
[2:04:48] <%radda343> ! ELMO AT RISK !
[2:04:50] <%SirGO0SE> Pats MOTHERLY INSTINCTS kicked in
[2:04:57] <%SirGO0SE> and he sensed the vomit
[2:05:00] <%ColonelRozum> @Faustgesicht it was upstairs
[2:05:07] <leargo> like in any cat keeper
[2:05:19] <%thelaxinator> an elmo is a type of helmet, further cementing pat's obsession with weird hats
[2:05:29] <%shawntk_> stream cancelled, Nurse Pat has to help his son
[2:05:42] <%Lithdoran> Cats make distinct noises when they're vomiting
[2:05:43] <Koosahmii> The sound of a cat barfing could raise a cat owner from the grave
[2:05:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Nurse Pat. Pat's more of an Orderly
[2:05:54] <%SirGO0SE> we all know paige must wear hat, preferably tiny. but we still are unsure if pat too must partake in hat
[2:06:21] <leargo> maybe hat optional
[2:06:21] <ranarath> man, this music makes me think of donkey kong country 2
[2:06:30] <%SirGO0SE> bane mask was confirmed though
[2:06:44] <%Lithdoran> This music sounds nothing like DKC2
[2:07:14] <%SirGO0SE> dont kill me if wrong but i think this is F1NG3RS tune
[2:07:31] <+faithless_zealot> It's ok
[2:07:32] <ranarath> yeah, i think that's who made it.
[2:07:34] <chronoxgp> i waited until you came back
[2:07:35] <%starotter70> Hey

[2:10:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Dig up
[2:10:45] <%Faustgesicht> Faustgesicht subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! there's probably some clever math things I could with this streak, FF7, and FF14; but fuck it i'm stupid. Good to see ya.
[2:10:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> use bombs
[2:10:46] <%juxtest> You just have to do it the right way

[2:11:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I will have fun with the for fucks sake @happyface699 thank you
[2:11:47] <mankeyfigh> @neo_kaiser you can’t here for some reason
[2:11:51] <%Ranryu692> cheer502 I'm glad you're enjoying FE16. Fun fact: There is an Anna (the cute redheaded merchant) in every Fire Emblem game except FE2 and its remake, FE15. They are canonically all sisters, even though they exist across time and dimensions. In Fire Emblem Heroes, the gacha game, the reason there are units who wear swimsuits is because every year, Anna tricks heroes into buying them to help fund your army (unless one of her sisters beat her to the sale).
[2:11:57] <+Shadicara> Stop stealing all their paper pat
[2:12:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yay
[2:12:02] <%razielhex> ..BING.. ..BING...

[2:12:25] <mankeyfigh> Nooooo
[2:12:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> double deck their toilet before you leave
[2:12:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas
[2:12:32] <mankeyfigh> Noperino
[2:12:42] <%Anonymasque> All cannot be steal, Baba is steal.
[2:12:45] <%ShichiNoBushi> Blue Materia only combines with Green, right?
[2:12:48] <King___Crimson> What do you think this is, skyrim?
[2:12:52] <%Mekhet09> Yes.
[2:12:53] <mankeyfigh> Usselesssss
[2:12:54] <@lewdskeletor13> But if Baba ceases to be
[2:12:56] <King_thunder365> useless useless muda muda
[2:12:57] <miendrh93> Incorrect
[2:13:04] <miendrh93> Blue will also combine with red
[2:13:05] <meteor530> Ah throwing up. Always the answer.
[2:13:06] <%radda343> isn't this where cait sith's ultimate weapon is
[2:13:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wasn't there something in one of the lockers?
[2:13:11] <miendrh93> Added effect and element
[2:13:12] <@lewdskeletor13> I had to clean a double decker toilet at work, pls don’t Pat
[2:13:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah
[2:13:14] <%Wrashis> you can use the treadmill
[2:13:16] <Neo_Kaiser> Go grab Cait Siths ultimate weapon thats just to the north in the locker room
[2:13:17] <%arcaderabbit48> oh no
[2:13:18] <meteor530> Yup in the lockers
[2:13:18] <%Wrashis> if youre interested
[2:13:19] <%depressed_skeleton> for the sex
[2:13:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think it is.
[2:13:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> on the revisit
[2:13:28] <+Shadicara> LUL
[2:13:29] <%Frost_Quill> Talks to the people doing normal stuff. Ignores the guy lying down.
[2:13:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> but does she wiggle the bepis
[2:13:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Ah, Cait Sith. The best character in the game
[2:13:37] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat You should check out the vending machines
[2:13:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's like pigtails, but for your belly.
[2:13:42] <%MelBrooksKA> @lewdskeletor13 He's doing it right now, you can't stop him
[2:13:45] <%AbnormalVoid> holy shit
[2:13:49] <%AbnormalVoid> I never knew that
[2:13:52] <%Tennochief> !uptime
[2:13:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 13m.
[2:13:52] <%logoth_> "This is stupid"
[2:13:57] <%Tennochief> FUCK I'M LATE
[2:13:59] <californaya> yep. that's a treadmill.
[2:14:00] <%depressed_skeleton> gonna be thin in no time
[2:14:01] <meteor530> Work them calves! Work them thighs!
[2:14:02] <+ryosuke91kc> i never knew you could do that
[2:14:06] <%supersugoisenpai1> he run
[2:14:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it'd be funny if this gave you "xp" or something. Cuz exercise.
[2:14:06] <%Wrashis> big trapz
[2:14:08] <%thelaxinator> this ain't dead rising 1
[2:14:08] <%Anonymasque> Ah Cait Sith, the biggest waste of a character slot in the game.
[2:14:12] <Ion_Laser> Feel the burn!
[2:14:12] <%starotter70> Can't wait to see what he calls Cait Sith
[2:14:20] <chronoxgp> hamster wheels
[2:14:20] <+ryosuke91kc> cardio ftw
[2:14:22] <EuropanLamprey> This was Shinra's plan all along
[2:14:23] <%Frost_Quill> Do you get anything for that?
[2:14:28] <meteor530> No
[2:14:30] <King_thunder365> @logoth_ Were you trying to quote when Shinji says "This is dumb"?
[2:14:31] <King___Crimson> GET FIT
[2:14:32] <%Tennochief> how far has Pat gone since the stream started?
[2:14:37] <InugamiTheHound> caith sith= garbage or useless
[2:14:37] <+ryosuke91kc> wtf u only ran for like a minute. thats not how you cardio
[2:14:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> guess you're a stinky smash player now
[2:14:41] <MassConnect> Darth Cait
[2:14:46] <%arcaderabbit48> @Anonymasque The sad thing is, I'd actually give that title to Red XIII. And I actually LIKE Red XIII
[2:14:50] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[2:14:51] <%manwithboxonhead> Cat is totally not a S*Y
[2:14:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hurdur hur
[2:14:59] <Desertfishing> meh useless megaphone
[2:15:00] <+Itselguapo> I understand that reference
[2:15:03] <%thelaxinator> whoa that's nice foreshadowing
[2:15:08] <%radda343> no but it's the best one tho
[2:15:12] <Desertfishing> nobody uses those
[2:15:18] <mankeyfigh> Vending machines in gym
[2:15:26] <+Ploobie> Does Pat know about the 7H / Remako mods?
[2:15:27] <meteor530> So Cait Siths power to harm things is to shout at them.
[2:15:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah this map thing
[2:15:32] <Ion_Laser> WutFace
[2:15:35] <+Shadicara> Use your gunblade pat Kappa
[2:15:41] <%manwithboxonhead> I dont remember this
[2:15:42] <+ryosuke91kc> he uses the megaphone to tell his bear to attack
[2:15:42] <%radda343> weirder than the sentient house?
[2:15:42] <+Itselguapo> fucking chainsaw fish
[2:15:42] <%Yadogari> Got a problem with fish Pat?
[2:15:48] <%Frost_Quill> Shinra employees gotta be careful about the giant flying sawblade snakes.
[2:15:48] <bobxmaker> what's your ideal party paaaaat?
[2:15:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think I caught one of these things in the Orb Vallis
[2:15:50] <%thelaxinator> it's a security drone that uses chainsaws as drive treads
[2:15:51] <+Pixel_Matt> tomatoFear
[2:15:52] <EuropanLamprey> Fucking Buzzsaw Tapeworm roaming this office building
[2:15:52] <InugamiTheHound> yes let's have a chainsaw monster roam the halls in shirna LOL
[2:15:54] <%starotter70> @Ploobie He tried them, but he couldn't get it to work
[2:15:54] <%thelaxinator> that's METAL
[2:15:55] <+Bigdrifter210> just wasted like 30min on stone vigil hard because the party was too retarded to learn the canon mechanics
[2:16:00] <hippieofdeath> Whaaaaaat the fuck was that?
[2:16:01] <+TridentBerryBurst> Why not?
[2:16:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It's for wood working
[2:16:03] <%ShichiNoBushi> Because it's cool.
[2:16:03] <mankeyfigh> Hacks
[2:16:04] <+Itselguapo> PUT THAT IN THE REMAKE!
[2:16:07] <meteor530> It's ok Pat. Don't question it. Just drink the Bleach.
[2:16:08] <Basch71> don't worry about that
[2:16:13] <@commanderclaw> What is it with evil corporations and tiny model cities?
[2:16:14] <%arcaderabbit48> @meteor530 He uses the megaphone to give his mog robot commands to attack enemies. Why megaphoens directly empower the mog bot is unclear
[2:16:22] <%Anonymasque> @arcaderabbit48 I see your point, but even after Nibelheim I still have Red some space in the party.
[2:16:27] <%ShichiNoBushi> Let me match it with this question: Why is there a Hell House?
[2:16:38] <+jamsbybetty> it's a Makophone
[2:16:46] <rhus> oh god, I just remembered what this room is
[2:16:46] <%thelaxinator> hell house answers to nothing, for it has no answers
[2:16:48] <%Frost_Quill> @ShichiNoBushi Hojo probably.
[2:16:48] <%supersugoisenpai1> Hate this floor
[2:16:56] <%SirGO0SE> Ass3Dayz*
[2:17:00] <meteor530> This is the best puzzle.
[2:17:02] <%Yadogari> I never got past this puzzle
[2:17:03] <%MattDemers> I really love how they don't speed up the music if you use the speed-up thing @AngriestPat. Much better than like, an emulator speed-up
[2:17:04] <%Yadogari> Kappa
[2:17:08] <meteor530> No brain power required.
[2:17:09] <%radda343> I hope the remake makes this an actual puzzle
[2:17:14] <MassConnect> this is what I call "do the only thing"
[2:17:17] <%arcaderabbit48> @Anonymasque Okay yeah, from a gameplay perspective Cait Sith is really the worst character. Red XIII isn't great, but his Limit Breaks can still eb really useful for their buffs. I meant more storywise
[2:17:18] <%Anonymasque> If we're going to ask about Hell House we're just going to have to get into a long list of bizarre enemies in FF7
[2:17:29] <%arcaderabbit48> Good
[2:17:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Thats a good list
[2:17:34] <%supersugoisenpai1> steal
[2:17:38] <+Intolerable> is Paige there? Or is she sleep?
[2:17:43] <Ion_Laser> sleep

[2:23:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> You think Tifa would call Palmer the stair word
[2:24:08] <Psyramics> that dude is in a board meeting singing songs and bouncing around
[2:24:08] <%Frost_Quill> Oh yeah he was the space guy. I forgot about that. I legit thought TFS's abridged made that up.

[2:24:18] <ミュウレ4242> the space program is humanity's only hope, and everyone just makes fun of it.

[2:25:34] <Sokumotanaka> @AngriestPat So apparently reeve here controls cait sith by his OWN limit break that controls inanimate objects.. It's in a popular japanese official ff7 mag

[2:25:35] <+LandOfTheWay> who's aeris?
[2:25:35] <ミュウレ4242> might not be barbed. hyenas are in the same family, and they have way different junk.

[2:25:51] <%wjones0415> jojo is one fucked up individual.
[2:25:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> ass4dayz knows not this Aeris/th
[2:25:57] <@lewdskeletor13> Excuse me it’s Ass4Dayz
[2:26:00] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay but no seriously, what is H O J O's actual plan here? He's going to have the last of the Ancients have sex with an animal. A magical intelligent animal, but still a four-legged cat/lion/dog/wolf ginger beast thing. What does he expect to come from this!?
[2:26:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Come on now, no need to kinkshame Hojo
[2:26:12] <%Lithdoran> Who the fuck is Aeris?
[2:26:14] <Valdorick> Did I miss Pat talking to Knuckles 500 times in prison?
[2:26:14] <+EatinEden> you chose this path, don’t back out now

[2:26:19] <Darkfire346> Aeris is just Aerith spelled with more freedom
[2:26:21] <natebud> kink shame hojo to death
[2:26:24] <%Lithdoran> does he mean Ass4dayz?
[2:26:28] <meteor530> He deserves all the shame. I bet he's into BDSM as well.
[2:26:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> whos though is the question
[2:26:30] <+Scevda> @arcaderabbit48 He doesn't know but he thinks he will like it.
[2:26:30] <rmwolfe> hojo is actually just not very good at his job
[2:26:30] <%Frost_Quill> I wonder how many people will freak out when they said Areith's/Aeris' name in the remake.
[2:26:31] <$jobbedbone> not the kind of bestiality you want to take home to mother
[2:26:33] <chronoxgp> cloud is just walking through that place with a horse cutter strapped to his back
[2:26:34] <blackorchidKI2> @arcaderabbit48 Furries.
[2:26:34] <machshop> @arcaderabbit48 a new specimen
[2:26:37] <mankeyfigh> I will kinkshame the fuck outta HOJO
[2:26:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Hojo is just a trash excuse for a scientist. A failure compared to his predecessor
[2:26:40] <VirtuaRailith> Hojo wants to create the ultimate life form... shadow the hedgehog
[2:26:51] <%thelaxinator> isn't he planning on trapping you?
[2:26:51] <meteor530> Haha
[2:26:56] <%arcaderabbit48> So does this mean that Red and Ass4Dayz are somehow genetically compatible!?
[2:26:57] <%SirGO0SE> there is no kink shaming. only kink sharing.
[2:27:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> shut up with the Aeris/th argument. for the sake of fuck. it literally doesn't matter.
[2:27:14] <%arcaderabbit48> I prefer the middle ground. Aerish
[2:27:15] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat This floor is where you can find the better sword for CLOUD
[2:27:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Listen. The ending cutscene shows us life finds a way
[2:27:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> her name is canonically Ass4days.
[2:27:24] <%Rust_Wick> air whis
[2:27:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> kinda matters now that they're voicing the characters and gonna be saying their goddamn names.
[2:27:28] <GustauveVIII> SOLDIERS
[2:27:30] <%republicofu> STEAL
[2:27:32] <natebud> This is no Aeriz only Ass4Dayz
[2:27:34] <GustauveVIII> stealll
[2:27:37] <InugamiTheHound> wasn't there two scientist in crisie core and they both kinda scummy but not a scummy as Hojo
[2:27:39] <%arkv01> CRIME
[2:27:39] <blackorchidKI2> @arcaderabbit48 Now you got me thinking of Family Guy with that.
[2:27:40] <meteor530> THEFT IS GOOD
[2:27:43] <chronoxgp> Aireeeees
[2:27:43] <mankeyfigh> LUCKKKKKKKYYYY
[2:27:44] <%SirGO0SE> but does her name change as the days draw nearer?
[2:27:50] <ミュウレ4242> sso now we're also gonna have japanese and english pronounciations.
[2:27:52] <%juxtest> Her name is Asth4Dayz
[2:27:55] <%thelaxinator> are these real s.o.l.d.i.e.r.s?
[2:27:56] <foxhounder29> pat are you going to date ja rule or no?
[2:28:03] <MasterDecoder> No matter her name, her fate is sealed..
[2:28:06] <meteor530> Lower rank ones yes. They are Soliders
[2:28:11] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah actually, what the FUCK does Hojo think he's gonna be doing? Did he do something to RedXIII to make him genetically compatible with humans? Or are Ancients SUPER fertile and can breed with anything that's alive?
[2:28:17] <+Scevda> I wish I could control exactly how fast the game wnrt
[2:28:22] <%D33TR> stealing from these guys take ages
[2:28:23] <machshop> @thelaxinator no they also believe they are zack
[2:28:25] <%Frost_Quill> Could Aerith fuck a tree and make a dryad?
[2:28:29] <ranarath> They will say Aeris' name a different way every time in tehe remake
[2:28:30] <%starotter70> One day....
[2:28:31] <%radda343> roll them dice
[2:28:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Maybe it's cuz the Ancients are so connected to the Lifestream or whatever all that jazz was.
[2:28:44] <disflipmat> I like that the AI is so dumb that it keeps trying to use abilities even when it's out of MP
[2:28:46] <foxhounder29> could red xiii mate with ja rule?
[2:28:47] <meteor530> I remember doing this on the plane a few weeks ago. Took 28 tries.
[2:28:49] <%Takreth> Imagine this on normal speed
[2:28:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> I named her Atreyu.
[2:28:51] <mankeyfigh> ITS HARD
[2:28:52] <%arcaderabbit48> @Frost_Quill Thank you!
[2:28:53] <%thelaxinator> I'm sure someone got it in natural play
[2:28:53] <chronoxgp> should jus nickname her pin cushion
[2:28:55] <%D33TR> its super low chance

[2:30:39] <%dheng1> these enemies better be in the remake
[2:30:46] <+Scevda> Attack this stationary highway divider!
[2:30:48] <GustauveVIII> its because of your elemental you're not doing damage
[2:30:49] <EuropanLamprey> You know, this game seems a little stupid at times
[2:30:50] <mankeyfigh> @andrizzleton YES
[2:30:51] <VirtuaRailith> man ff7 has stupid enemies
[2:30:51] <%Frost_Quill> Clumbo STR, Knuckles DEX, Ass4Dayz FTH, Chewie GUN
[2:30:56] <Theonlypegsus> What was that???
[2:30:57] <%Takreth> You've never been attacked by a sign before?
[2:31:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> Is it Hard Edge or Fire=Elemental that dealt 0 damage?
[2:31:03] <%starotter70> Oh hell yeah, this part
[2:31:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> if I had a stand, I'd want it to be Hokey Pokey.
[2:31:05] <%Wrashis> @AngriestPat cloud did no damage because you had elemental attached to lightning
[2:31:07] <natebud> Very hidden
[2:31:09] <chronoxgp> drawing 3 models with simple forms is the problem

[2:31:39] <%thelaxinator> scientifically, what does he want with nanaki?
[2:31:40] <%SirGO0SE> PHEW
[2:31:46] <%Frost_Quill> So what the fuck does Hojo think is gonna happen when Aerith and Red "breed?"
[2:31:47] <natebud> Doesn't looks so precious to me
[2:31:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The raping shall commence...soonish.
[2:31:53] <ミュウレ4242> tifa is like "i'd fuck it."

[2:32:15] <%GabeSweetMan> whelp
[2:32:16] <%Frost_Quill> Jenova is probably one of my favorite parts of this game.
[2:32:16] <SilverJakler> that woman got no head
[2:32:17] <EuropanLamprey> AHH ALIEN TITS! MY MIND!
[2:32:18] <King_thunder365> "That woman has no head"
[2:32:18] <@commanderclaw> Oh no, it's the Jenova's Witnesses!
[2:32:18] <%wjones0415> where is it fucking head?
[2:32:20] <@StridentSong> Banned
[2:32:23] <VirtuaRailith> that's what happened to me when I saw a boob the first time too cloud
[2:32:23] <mankeyfigh> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA RR

[2:32:33] <%marvinbrewton25> Hojo in the top chamber with tissue and lotion just waiting.
[2:32:33] <+Andrizzleton> witness me!
[2:32:34] <Sokumotanaka> Barrent: Okay WTF CLOUD!?
[2:32:35] <%RupanSen> insight gained
[2:32:35] <groovykrovvy> T for Tiddies
[2:32:36] <%starotter70> Where's it's Fucking Head!?
[2:32:38] <Lordkeyblade> That woman has no head
[2:32:39] <disflipmat> lol I fucking love Barret's reaction
[2:32:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Barret's reaction is the best.
[2:32:40] <MetroidSlayerP7> *tiddies
[2:32:41] <JasonTheJazz> THIS WHOLE THINGS STUPID
[2:32:42] <reonome> barret pls
[2:32:43] <%templar010> Barret: This is bullshit
[2:32:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Barret's right, it IS stupid
[2:32:46] <Darkfire346> eye tiddy
[2:32:49] <+Scevda> "A Torso is fine too"
[2:32:50] <%razielhex> Barret sums up FF7 in a single line
[2:32:50] <@lewdskeletor13> So no bead?
[2:32:51] <+cvp5127> thank you barret
[2:32:54] <Basch71> Barret woke to this shit
[2:32:54] <+Shadicara> Who's barret?
[2:32:55] <Fathuran> So when I first saw that image, I thought that jenovah's beheaded torso was an alien head
[2:32:56] <mankeyfigh> Barrett’s right
[2:32:56] <@lewdskeletor13> So no head?
[2:32:57] <%UncleAWOL> clumbo needs more eyes on the inside
[2:32:58] <%Agami23> if they just shot a fire spell into that pod, would most of ff7 be fixed?
[2:33:03] <%thelaxinator> the head is in advent children
[2:33:03] <Sokumotanaka> Barrent sums up my feelings on this whole game
[2:33:04] <Darkfire346> you could just fuck the neckhole
[2:33:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> *breaks skateboard*
[2:33:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh excuse us. CHEWIE
[2:33:13] <%GabeSweetMan> Chewie's reaction.
[2:33:13] <+Shadicara> All I see is Chewie
[2:33:15] <rhus> what the fuck is a barret, I only know chewie
[2:33:18] <%Frost_Quill> So the "Sephiroth" you meet at certain points is actually just Jenova or something right?
[2:33:25] <+earthboy2k> Kotaku did a great series of videos about FFVII's translation errors
[2:33:30] <%Takreth> Here we go again
[2:33:34] <ranarath> @Frost_Quill That's right
[2:33:34] <%thelaxinator> yeah seph is in a crystal in the crater
[2:33:37] <disflipmat> @Frost_Quill Pretty much, yeah
[2:33:39] <mankeyfigh> @agami23 Nah the moment Sephiroth went crazy
[2:33:48] <King___Crimson> "I DON'T WANT NOTHIN' TO DO WITH IT"
[2:33:49] <%starotter70> Do not make the mistake that I did and put Poison on the Elemental Materia
[2:33:53] <Darkfire346> spoilers, guys! gawwwww
[2:33:58] <%SirGO0SE> seph is a j.o crystal
[2:33:59] <disflipmat> That's why I REALLY want them to play up the freaky space alien angle for Jenova in the remake
[2:34:00] <+Scevda> No wonder everyone loved this when they were growing up. It was jam packed full of taboo stuff that their parents wouldn't want them to be exposed but got away with it because of the aesthetics and graphics
[2:34:06] <mankeyfigh> You’re going to have a bad time
[2:34:20] <KaseKaizer> earn this
[2:34:23] <Thalchampz> stealing reminds me of FF9, though 7 seem to be more forgiving- NVM...
[2:34:31] <Thalchampz> it's just as duimb
[2:34:34] <%SirGO0SE> FF9 is not fucking forgiving
[2:34:39] <antthefool> Give him dat S U C C
[2:34:40] <%arkv01> jenova is going to be ultra fuckable in th reemake
[2:34:41] <%Yadogari> Stealing from Gizamaluke NotLikeThis
[2:34:42] <disflipmat> At least in 7 once you've stolen once that's it
[2:34:43] <%radda343> you an have the other two defend to take less damage while you're stealing
[2:34:47] <Neo_Kaiser> Press select and R2 in combat Pat
[2:34:50] <%supersugoisenpai1> This is the worst game ever
[2:34:50] <natebud> I hate it, keeps doing it...
[2:34:50] <@StridentSong> It has a unique item though!
[2:35:00] <%Estuko> HYPEST GAMEPLAY ON TWITCH
[2:35:09] <%AdmiralButtloaf> this game has so many weird centaurs to steal from
[2:35:10] <%Frost_Quill> I sometimes genuinely forget Khimarhi is a blue mage and not a thief since I always make him a thief super early.
[2:35:11] <%starotter70> Do you think that Clumbo is just trying to reach into the enemies pockets throughout the fight?
[2:35:12] <%SirGO0SE> first playthrough my dumbass got to the "HEY DONT BRING MAGIC HERE" part and kept thinking "surely, they will let me change my party, its fine to save here" and softlocked my run
[2:35:12] <mankeyfigh> HYPEEEEE
[2:35:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> incoming reset
[2:35:15] <+earthboy2k> reminds me of Vinny's ff9 stealing
[2:35:16] <CoffeeTableBlack> i think tifa has better stats for stealing
[2:35:16] <%razielhex> promising nothing and delivering less
[2:35:16] <%Yadogari> TIFA LUL
[2:35:18] <KaseKaizer> STUMB
[2:35:18] <%arcaderabbit48> The stealing mechanic of FF9 is one of the reasons I can never go back to that game. I love the idea of making your MC a thief and having stealing items be an integral part of powering your characters, but oh my god Zidane level your Pickpocket skill!
[2:35:18] <%starotter70> And Everybody is like WTF?
[2:35:18] <disflipmat> TOO FAST
[2:35:24] <disflipmat> LUDICROUS SPEED
[2:35:27] <InugamiTheHound> yes Sephiroth is still stuck in the life stream. Sephiroth you see is actually Jenvoa
[2:35:32] <%Takreth> how can fist without knuckles
[2:35:47] <%Frost_Quill> Wait what does select and r2 do? I missed it.
[2:35:47] <%razielhex> When was his last save, because he's gonna game over by failing to steal jewelry
[2:35:49] <%thelaxinator> I left for 30 seconds and it all went to shit
[2:35:51] <InugamiTheHound> pat has hard edge now
[2:35:58] <%SirGO0SE> rise beefers
[2:36:01] <+ShedVolans> Sonic 3 & Fisting
[2:36:05] <%ShichiNoBushi> All has limited uses per battle.
[2:36:06] <natebud> This battle has not been cost effective
[2:36:12] <alrobot2014> the all is on ice isn't it
[2:36:13] <+earthboy2k> on ice
[2:36:14] <%supersugoisenpai1> Only good once per battle
[2:36:15] <%starotter70> On Ice
[2:36:16] <%marvinbrewton25> Rngesus says not today!
[2:36:16] <%Frost_Quill> All is limited?
[2:36:17] <%radda343> you can only use it a certain number of times
[2:36:19] <disflipmat> You can only target all for as many levels as the materia has
[2:36:21] <Darkfire346> Tifa: Queen of the Beefers
[2:36:22] <$shurtal> yeah, it always did
[2:36:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> all can't be used multiple times. Gotta upgrade
[2:36:23] <%radda343> per leel of the matiera4
[2:36:24] <%RupanSen> it has limited uses per battle until you level it up
[2:36:24] <%templar010> You have to level it up
[2:36:24] <Neo_Kaiser> Press full health button
[2:36:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Finally
[2:36:26] <%republicofu> until it levels up you only get one
[2:36:27] <GustauveVIII> leveling up ALL gives it +1 use
[2:36:27] <CoffeeTableBlack> you can only use all once per level of the all materia
[2:36:27] <natebud> Damn right it does
[2:36:28] <%supersugoisenpai1> Gets more as you level it
[2:36:30] <disflipmat> So at most you get 5 all-targets
[2:36:31] <%ShichiNoBushi> Level All up for more uses.
[2:36:32] <%starotter70> Oh right
[2:36:33] <+EthorXL> the uses of All go up when the materia levels up
[2:36:34] <shiny_prinny> 1 per materia level
[2:36:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah.
[2:36:35] <Desertfishing> level it up you can use it more
[2:36:39] <MassConnect> I never not farmed enough to know all is limited
[2:36:39] <ミュウレ4242> that's why you level the fuck out of the All materia.
[2:36:41] <@StridentSong> All can be used once per materia level
[2:36:42] <Sokumotanaka> Even my dumbass knew that and I hate this dumb game
[2:36:44] <+Andrizzleton> can only do it once per battle level 1, twice at level 2
[2:36:44] <mankeyfigh> You can only do it once per all
[2:36:45] <+Andrizzleton> etc
[2:36:55] <%Frost_Quill> So once per level.
[2:36:56] <Neo_Kaiser> Once ALL is mastered you can use it infinitely
[2:36:57] <%RupanSen> you just forgot
[2:36:59] <CoffeeTableBlack> and all materias are the best to sell cause they worth big money at max level
[2:37:01] <rhus> @MassConnect same, this is news to me
[2:37:07] <Neo_Kaiser> Same thing with summons, once per battle until you level it up.
[2:37:10] <natebud> Pressing the shoulder buttons lets you switch from all to single, to save a charge of all @AngriestPat
[2:37:14] <+Scevda> wow level 13...I think I by accident leveled Cloud to 33 before getting to the mansion
[2:37:14] <%Nobrev> are you sure you played this game when you were younger
[2:37:20] <%Tsumikiro> !uptime
[2:37:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 37m.
[2:37:24] <+ArcLifth> Can't be 2 of 3
[2:37:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> like over 1 million gils worth
[2:37:30] <%republicofu> the summons thig is faulse
[2:37:34] <%Frost_Quill> What does this guy drop?
[2:37:35] <mankeyfigh> LUCK
[2:37:37] <%radda343> use defend
[2:37:45] <ミュウレ4242> few people ever play this game deeply, so it has a lot of replay value.
[2:37:45] <+HeyBoston> don't use defend
[2:37:49] <%Owkono> but you need 5 of them
[2:37:59] <+Scevda> Q: Does anybody else think it looks like Paige is eating her hair in the side pic?
[2:38:00] <jerkhov_> stealing is why I hate trying to completionist ff games
[2:38:04] <%thelaxinator> ass4days aside, who are you supposed to use as a dedicated caster in this game?
[2:38:14] <natebud> Imagine what it's going to be like when he gets the Enemy Skill Materia.
[2:38:20] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> "C'mon, just gimme". Story of my life right there.
[2:38:21] <jerkhov_> red 13 has good magic stats
[2:38:34] <%starotter70> I use RedXiii
[2:38:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> it's frustrating playing sub zero
[2:38:38] <ミュウレ4242> thelaxinator, the one w/ good caster stats who isn't off doing their own side stuff at the moment.
[2:38:41] <$jobbedbone> frusturbated
[2:38:41] <%AdmiralButtloaf> steal rate sucks and mug is worse
[2:38:43] <%arcaderabbit48> @thelaxinator Vincent actually has a pretty good magic stat when he's not eating people and turning in to a horromovie monster
[2:38:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, I don't think Pat is gonna try THAT hard for the Enemy SKill shit.
[2:38:53] <disflipmat> But at least mug is an attack too
[2:38:58] <mankeyfigh> @owkono IKR!? most people just get 3 defensive items and swap every time they swap characters, which is annoying to me
[2:38:59] <%marvinbrewton25> everyone is a dedicated caster in this game when you fight the weapons lol
[2:39:06] <%shawntk_> @Zaphire_Saucypants There's only like 4 he needs anyway
[2:39:07] <King_thunder365> @thelaxinator Technically anyone can be your dedicated caster. Especially when you can farm items for increasing specific stats near the end of the game when you have everyone already at level 99.
[2:39:07] <InugamiTheHound> if you don't get carbon bangle here , where is next place you can buy it?
[2:39:09] <%Estuko> had a salad to try to eat healther, that shit was unsatisfying FeelsBadMan
[2:39:11] <%AdmiralButtloaf> only level difference and steal glove increases steal rate
[2:39:12] <+Intolerable> Equip?
[2:39:16] <ミュウレ4242> enemy skill is cool, tho. blue mages represent.
[2:39:27] <ミュウレ4242> get some matra magic and trine up in here.
[2:39:41] <%templar010> enemy skill breaks the game
[2:39:43] <jerkhov_> dog sex
[2:39:44] <%Frost_Quill> They played Blue Mage pretty damn dirty in XIV.
[2:39:48] <ranarath> I abused the heck out of Trine, it was so good.
[2:39:50] <Eternal_Harmony> lmao
[2:39:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Big Guard and Aqua Lung and Magic Breath and Beta
[2:39:53] <%ColonelRozum> yeeeea red13 sex pit
[2:39:55] <natebud> Can we get some love for Big Guard?
[2:39:55] <%manwithboxonhead> Well fuck
[2:39:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Estuko drink water, chew gum to curb the appetite.
[2:39:55] <%starotter70> LUL

[2:40:01] <$shurtal> That's no sample chamber, that's a sexnasium
[2:40:01] <disflipmat> White Wind is super good
[2:40:03] <King_thunder365> "Yeah, that makes sense!"
[2:40:05] <%templar010> Beta
[2:40:07] <+Scevda> In the room too
[2:40:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Isn’t the sex out the dungeon you’re currently in?
[2:40:10] <Ion_Laser> Time to save dat ass!
[2:40:13] <$jobbedbone> MY MASTURBATORIUM
[2:40:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wait, has Pat seen the FF7 Machinima thing?
[2:40:17] <InugamiTheHound> red 13 is furry icon
[2:40:17] <+Scevda> "Its all so tiresome"
[2:40:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kill them all, Clumbo
[2:40:26] <%marvinbrewton25> Oh the crazy full on 5 minute chain summon combo you can do with knights of the round xD
[2:40:26] <SassyAssSlap> hojo isnt even the one operating the machine though
[2:40:29] <+ArcLifth> Just shoot all the equipment
[2:40:31] <KaseKaizer> TOS monkaS
[2:40:32] <mankeyfigh> @templar010 Beta is a bitch and a half to get early game
[2:40:32] <disflipmat> Who cares about operating the equipment? We just need to break the fucking glass
[2:40:33] <%Frost_Quill> So really though, what the fuck is Hojo planning to do? They can't breed unless Hojo made Red compatible with humans, in which case he could just make test tube ancients if he could do that.

[2:50:47] <blackorchidKI2> @Shwepie At least, not in her... Kappa
[2:50:52] <natebud> Just enough to suggest cosmo canyon
[2:50:59] <Sokumotanaka> I'm both AMAZED and BAFFLED That Red's species is a thing in this world and yet you never learn of the name of the race.
[2:51:08] <+Ell1ot> why did Aeris and Barret split up?
[2:51:11] <%thelaxinator> did pat take the stairs?
[2:51:13] <HollowMan190> why is woolive in guilty gear and older woolive in tekken 7
[2:51:17] <InugamiTheHound> not a fan of putting too much material on characters, takes away too much HP
[2:51:17] <%segonian> does that mean he's going to find a random 4-legged animal to fuck?
[2:51:18] <+Itselguapo> OH BOY!
[2:51:21] <jerkhov_> because his species is dying out

[2:51:47] <jerkhov_> elmo get in the camera
[2:51:47] <Neo_Kaiser> Because you might come across an enemy with an ability you can learn
[2:51:47] <%arcaderabbit48> I think its meant to be implied that Red doesn't acutally know what he is because there are so few of him left
[2:52:09] <%radda343> you can level it for giggles
[2:52:09] <@lewdskeletor13> I was just following orders!
[2:52:10] <%thelaxinator> man no one in shinra gives a shit, they all just want to go home
[2:52:11] <+Scevda> "Just following orders, and making vids every so often"
[2:52:11] <+Ell1ot> that guy was like, "i just work here"
[2:52:16] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Doesn't the border have to be updated now that Paige is Level 31
[2:52:27] <natebud> "you have to understand Clumbo, it was my fetish too!"

[2:53:03] <%arcaderabbit48> Like, why is that a biological function?
[2:53:05] <+Scevda> For the techical limitations, red 13 looks pretty good for a quadraped animal for psx era
[2:53:11] <mankeyfigh> Why is your tail not on fire

[2:53:19] <+Scevda> Charmander sends his regards
[2:53:21] <%Frost_Quill> He's a Pokemon.
[2:53:23] <%StripesUltimateEdition> the nicest floor
[2:53:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If his tail's fire goes out, then he dies
[2:53:26] <Sokumotanaka> Cause he's a charzard
[2:53:28] <%Keyd00d> he's a secret pokemon
[2:53:29] <%thelaxinator> that being said if a man with a sword the size of a truck bumper, a big tiddie punch-girl and a talking fire wolf came into my place of work I'd do what they asked
[2:53:34] <Neo_Kaiser> Kill Clouds old mates!

[2:53:54] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Knuckles go down
[2:53:54] <natebud> Maybe playing at 300% speed isn't great all the time
[2:53:55] <%starotter70> KNUCKLES!! BibleThump
[2:53:56] <+Ell1ot> do date points go down when the character gets KO'd?
[2:54:03] <MassConnect> no

[2:54:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> why is eveerythign so fast
[2:54:15] <+Scevda> @thelaxinator But what if you carried around a lance all day in your dystopic science lab job on the middle of a flying pizza?
[2:54:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Is Pat under leveled? I feel like he's taking a lot of damage here
[2:54:17] <natebud> Knuckles should have paused the game and jumped out of there
[2:54:23] <%Frost_Quill> @TurtlesAndTentacles Switch version has a speed up.

[2:55:55] <%GabeSweetMan> The sass
[2:55:55] <%mostundesired> Press down, be a rebel, you're already a terrorist.
[2:56:00] <$shurtal> Should your ff7 layout be changed, now that paige leveled up? @angriestpat
[2:56:00] <%Keyd00d> Rude's gonna take you back to 69
[2:56:00] <+Ell1ot> 3 vs 2 kick their ass!
[2:56:01] <mankeyfigh> GOING UP
[2:56:03] <Neo_Kaiser> Yes, left thumbstick for speed, right thumbstick for full health, MP and limitbreak, both thumbsticks at the same time to turn off random encounters.
[2:56:03] <ameraaaaaa> I'm back bitchs!
[2:56:14] <TeepPhoenix> Here comes this dog marching into the president's office like it's no big thing.
[2:56:16] <MassConnect> lol, red's not tied up
[2:56:17] <%radda343> look at this asshole's battle station, it's like he's piloting a fuckin robot
[2:56:18] <Teyaric> Why isn't this a /fight/?! Oh, yeah, because Rude and Tseng is not enough to capture them!
[2:56:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what a fuckin desk
[2:56:23] <+satan_is_waitin> BUSTED
[2:56:23] <%Estuko> redbull: I'm a dog, they tried to make me fuck some chick
[2:56:24] <%GabeSweetMan> I love that Red(bull) just HANGS OUT.
[2:56:25] <%StripesUltimateEdition> It's for if you care about the store more than the gameplay
[2:56:29] <+Intolerable> Is it weird that I really like the Turks?
[2:56:31] <ameraaaaaa> long time since i watched a pat stream
[2:56:40] <HollowMan190> terks are such fucking dorks
[2:56:42] <rhus> no, everyone loves the turks
[2:56:44] <%AncelDeLambert> "SAFE! Safer with me than anywhere else!"
[2:56:45] <InugamiTheHound> how do you handcuff barret? he's got a gun arm?
[2:56:47] <%starotter70> @Intolerable Not at all
[2:56:47] <HeadsHeldHigh> twurks
[2:56:47] <TeepPhoenix> No, Intolerable, they're some of the best characters in the FF seires.
[2:56:47] <Valdorick> Don't forget to talk to Knuckles 100 time in prison to assure she's your date
[2:56:49] <natebud> Man Ass4Dayz is just being passed from sex dungeon to sex dungeon.
[2:56:50] <+StrawberryPantsu> You Give president Shinra a southern accent
[2:56:56] <jou_star> Look at this space desk.
[2:56:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat Forget it, Clumbo, it's Chinatown
[2:56:58] <+Ell1ot> that office desk is ridiculous
[2:57:00] <ameraaaaaa> I'm so fucking hungry
[2:57:02] <%Keyd00d> the Promised Neverland
[2:57:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Prez Shinra doesn't even bat an eye at Red talking
[2:57:10] <%Dovakhin573> Assfordays is a good name but floe had the best Aerith name ever it was MAHVEL
[2:57:12] <mayorrev> THERE'S OIL
[2:57:14] <DirgeNovak> Man the exposition is this game is so goddamn terrible
[2:57:15] <%Frost_Quill> Then the Cetra must be very fertile too!
[2:57:16] <+Itselguapo> After taking 2 weeks of grinding Machinist up to level 70 from level 32, and doing the main scenarios before shadowbringers, I'm almost in shadowbringers.
[2:57:20] <+Scevda> If you wanted to visit Israel, they should have just booked a flight
[2:57:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Pretty sure this is the last scene where the Turks actually get to be threatening or competent. Every scene after this is a slow decline to basically being Team Rocket
[2:57:22] <MassConnect> they tried to tie up red bull.. but they couldn't take his wings
[2:57:29] <%thelaxinator> the promised land is either a different planet, or a different method of living entirely. Either that or it's where midgar was before they built it
[2:57:29] <+satan_is_waitin> That talking coyote was just a talking dog
[2:57:33] <Darkfire346> the land is.......ferrrrrrtile
[2:57:34] <bear_breaker20> yuppp
[2:57:35] <rhus> MIDGAR 2
[2:57:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> back when video game writing was mediocre at best.
[2:57:40] <TeepPhoenix> You know, if Barrett turned around, he could probably nail the pres with his gun arm
[2:57:41] <%yet_another_brony> do you think this game might've been trying to get just a little political?
[2:57:42] <+Itselguapo> Alphinaud is still the worst character in FFXIV....
[2:57:45] <+Scevda> @satan_is_waitin damn straight
[2:57:49] <%Frost_Quill> @thelaxinator I like to think it's Spira.
[2:57:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @yet_another_brony at least it's not Ferngully
[2:57:57] <%starotter70> Oh Chewie
[2:57:58] <%mostundesired> Seems legit
[2:58:01] <%Estuko> @Itselguapo I'd do many terrible things to him though
[2:58:03] <%Keyd00d> @Itselguapo how dare you
[2:58:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> damn, rude must be strong as shit
[2:58:03] <knightmatty21> wait how'd they tie up barrels gun hand
[2:58:04] <TeepPhoenix> Stone cold.
[2:58:06] <Valdorick> @TeepPhoenix He missed a helicopter that was 10 meters away, I doubt he'll hit
[2:58:07] <natebud> im evil by the way
[2:58:08] <%Frost_Quill> @thelaxinator Considering Spira is literally another planet in this universe.
[2:58:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> bye Dead Man
[2:58:16] <+Itselguapo> Oh I dare Alphinaud is a freaking stupid.
[2:58:17] <Quietshun13> @itselguapo nah

[2:58:36] <Darkfire346> talking dog best friend!!
[2:58:42] <+ryosuke91kc> its crazy how 20 years ago they modeled him president shinra after our current president
[2:58:43] <Valdorick> Speak to her ONE HUN DRED TIMES
[2:58:49] <TeepPhoenix> RED HAS FLEAS?!
[2:58:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so...like...are we dating Tifa here?

[2:59:22] <%arcaderabbit48> Ass8Dayz?
[2:59:29] <hippieofdeath> Yo dog, wanna do some ecoterrorism?
[2:59:30] <%Keyd00d> SQUAWK GRAMPA
[2:59:31] <TeepPhoenix> "You're so damn boring" is one of my favorite bits of the game.
[2:59:31] <%segonian> Are the Shenra the Templars?
[2:59:32] <Youwereeatenbyalid> What is this
[2:59:35] <jerkhov_> rip the end
[2:59:37] <Valdorick> @Scevda In the PS1 version, the game is bugged to give you points toward the date every single time you talk to someone in the jail.
[2:59:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Is this some new indie game?
[2:59:42] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat To date Tifa, encourage her unlimited TIMES
[2:59:42] <+Ell1ot> i used to think Barret's cell bed was a heater
[2:59:45] <%thelaxinator> Marlene is like 30 now
[2:59:45] <natebud> I hope he though about me first
[2:59:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Barret, you're such a prick.
[2:59:51] <+Scevda> @Valdorick Ah
[2:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:55] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Looks...not great.
[3:00:00] <+Scevda> DRINK THE H 2 O
[3:00:01] <%thelaxinator> This game is set in like 1999 right?
[3:00:02] <Valdorick> But mostly memeing
[3:00:09] <jerkhov_> who you romancing?
[3:00:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> begone thot

[3:00:21] <+Ell1ot> Knuckles is giving me a good knuckling in here
[3:00:21] <zamzoph> PunOko
[3:00:24] <HeadsHeldHigh> catty
[3:00:25] <reonome> BIG JELLY
[3:00:27] <%Frost_Quill> I wonder why they didn't put the two women into the same cell and instead put the pretty boy and the buxom girl in the same cell.
[3:00:29] <%AbnormalVoid> vineJape
[3:00:30] <%Keyd00d> women am I right
[3:00:33] <TheUltraCarl> rip
[3:00:36] <natebud> "Don't lie to me Clumbo, I know you were thinking about Barrett!"
[3:00:43] <%Estuko> Knuckles: well I'M gonna suck his dick, and YOU'RE just gonna have to listen
[3:00:45] <NumbusPlays> unlock the planet?
[3:00:45] <+Intolerable> "The doctors say I only have hours of ass left..."
[3:00:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> tension, that's why.

[3:00:58] <+Scevda> The promised land was inside us all along
[3:01:10] <Sokumotanaka> DAMNIT TIFA GROW A PERSONALITY THAT DOESN'T RESOLVE AROUND CLOUD
[3:01:12] <%starotter70> Elmo's trying to speak to the planet
[3:01:17] <%Frost_Quill> The Primised Land was the friends we made along the way.
[3:01:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> found family dude. @ryosuke91kc
[3:01:20] <miendrh93> @knightmatty21 Cloud is the opposite of smooth

[3:01:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought haagen dazs adopted him @ryosuke91kc
[3:01:41] <%Frost_Quill> I will be MASSIVELY upset if Cloud is brooding and smooth in the remake.
[3:01:41] <TeepPhoenix> THE CAT IS DESTROYING THE FURNITURE?!
[3:01:45] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Elmo scream
[3:01:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> What
[3:01:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Okay
[3:01:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> Leave it to Me

[3:02:04] <TeepPhoenix> Is there some easter egg youre trying to unlock?
[3:02:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just who we're dating here. And this pleases me.
[3:02:06] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat's trying to date Tifa but he'll accidentally date Barrett.
[3:02:07] <%yet_another_brony> does this still work?
[3:02:07] <jerkhov_> flop
[3:02:07] <Youwereeatenbyalid> What the fuck is going on here
[3:02:10] <%Frost_Quill> So does this still work or did they fix it?
[3:02:14] <SilverJakler> pet da baby
[3:02:15] <+Itselguapo> You ready for more bitching about Pokemon sword and shield tomorrow!
[3:02:16] <GustauveVIII> i think aerith is more emotional tho :/
[3:02:17] <Valdorick> I'm doing great - my family recently got a new cat. Some asshole threw its 8 week old ass out their car, so my dad rescued him. He screm… lots @AngriestPat

[3:02:24] <fazoburquina> baby bite
[3:02:25] <%radda343> he attacc
[3:02:25] <+Ell1ot> what are you doing, Pat?
[3:02:25] <MetroidSlayerP7> If you click on Tifa 50 times you get a roll of film with Rebecca on it
[3:02:25] <natebud> There's gotta be some diminishing returns on this braveness
[3:02:27] <%wsintai> Good Elmo
[3:02:27] <+Scevda> Just continuously yell
[3:02:28] <artificiallynatural> CHOMP
[3:02:28] <knightmatty21> we're really leaving it to cloud huh
[3:02:28] <%GabeSweetMan> baby attak
[3:02:29] <jerkhov_> clumbo you're so brave
[3:02:31] <%Manly_BeardedOne> because cat
[3:02:32] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ryosuke91kc both, and that the grandpa is just a japanese translation from old man
[3:02:35] <%Anonymasque> Wait is this a CHEAP way to get Tifa date points?
[3:02:35] <Desertfishing> 100 more
[3:02:35] <KaseKaizer> more
[3:02:37] <%thelaxinator> 40
[3:02:38] <%Faustgesicht> This some sims level dating right here.

[3:02:40] <+ryosuke91kc> nah get more
[3:02:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> do it more foo
[3:02:41] <chad_irl> Clumbo's gotta hide that half-boner
[3:02:41] <TheUltraCarl> more
[3:02:42] <$CarlosEoM> @Youwereeatenbyalid this increases affinity with Tifa to ensure the date is with her later on the game
[3:02:43] <TeepPhoenix> This is like in FF9 if you say the same thing over and over Ruby will come out and call you a dumbass.
[3:02:43] <+harmlessgs> only works once pat
[3:02:45] <%starotter70> More
[3:02:47] <+ryosuke91kc> gotta make sure we go on that Tifa date man
[3:02:49] <jou_star> so brave
[3:02:51] <+ryosuke91kc> do it for like a minute
[3:02:51] <TheUltraCarl> MORE
[3:02:53] <%thelaxinator> 50
[3:02:56] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat justs wants to be told he's brave.
[3:02:56] <+earthboy2k> What is this trick
[3:02:56] <+Itselguapo> Fast foward
[3:02:56] <%wsintai> You did this 7 times
[3:02:56] <%starotter70> This reminds me of Fire Emblem
[3:03:01] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat bites can either mean "stop that" or "I love you so much" It's kinda hard to tell, I just go with if it breaks skin it's an angry bite.
[3:03:04] <+Ell1ot> is this date points stuff?
[3:03:04] <+Andrizzleton> It's a lock
[3:03:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @CarlosEoM oh wow. That's...certainly something.
[3:03:06] <%yet_another_brony> nice
[3:03:09] <%thelaxinator> 60
[3:03:09] <%Cinebeast> Cinebeast subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! awww yeah
[3:03:10] <+Scevda> Just yell continuously 'KIND HARD' at Tifa while making motions at your crotch 100 times
[3:03:16] <%manwithboxonhead> Hold my beer
[3:03:17] <@StridentSong> Tifa starts with the highest amount of relationship points, and you've boosted it well beyond anything the game needs. You only need 50 to get the alternate reaction after the crater
[3:03:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I lost count when Elmo bit you. You'll need to start over.
[3:03:19] <natebud> I believe the number was 9999
[3:03:20] <+without_borders> So brave
[3:03:22] <MistahMrMatt> does that do something?
[3:03:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> nah, 40 more to be safe
[3:03:27] <%thelaxinator> 67 by my count
[3:03:32] <jerkhov_> enterr the konami fuck code
[3:03:32] <Neo_Kaiser> Is this how Pat started dating Paige?
[3:03:33] <%Keyd00d> about 200 more times
[3:03:35] <%starotter70> Clumbo, you're so brave!
[3:03:36] <Valdorick> Now speak to Ass4Dayz 69 times to get the Black Materia
[3:03:37] <%arcaderabbit48> We must unlock the fuck
[3:03:38] <+ryosuke91kc> @Sphincter_Spelunker ahh so like an honorific
[3:03:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Clumbo you're SO brave! Put it in me!
[3:03:40] <mayorrev> what was he doing that for?
[3:03:41] <TeepPhoenix> Is cloud gonna sleep in the toilet?
[3:03:42] <jou_star> we need more bravery
[3:03:45] <JoeNeutrino> Grinding to boost Tifa's moist meter.
[3:03:50] <jerkhov_> beeg
[3:03:51] <InugamiTheHound> watch tifa take a huge shit
[3:03:53] <%arcaderabbit48> Clumbo SMASH
[3:03:54] <%radda343> why would you date tifa when you can date barrett
[3:03:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> he hates it
[3:03:56] <+Andrizzleton> what if it's on a 256 counter and you EXCEED and drop back down to 1?!?!?!
[3:03:59] <natebud> Columbo you are at least 67x more attractive than before.
[3:04:00] <Darkfire346> awe shiiiiiit
[3:04:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> for a date mechanic @mayorrev
[3:04:04] <chronoxgp> who the fuck would put a man and woman in the same jail cell
[3:04:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> So Knuckles is now wildly in love with Pat?
[3:04:11] <+Scevda> Enjoy that sweet baby, he will stay with your memories for all time.
[3:04:12] <mayorrev> oh wow
[3:04:12] <jerkhov_> elmo knows the camera's there
[3:04:14] <%wsintai> @chronoxgp Hojo?
[3:04:17] <%Keyd00d> scary bloodtrail time
[3:04:21] <TeepPhoenix> THE SHINRA, THAT'S WHO?
[3:04:22] <Valdorick> Yo - where's my GameFAQs "Save Aeith by talking to her exactly 777 times in the jail" crowd at!?
[3:04:22] <%segonian> he's sleeping against a wall...
[3:04:22] <miendrh93> Elmo made my cat jealous and now I have all the loves
[3:04:23] <TheUltraCarl> time for big spook
[3:04:29] <CrypticMochi> Went out to have a nice dinner, came back to Pat trying to make Tifa sploosh to his bravery
[3:04:30] <natebud> @chronoxgp well it has been established this is a fetish dungeon
[3:04:34] <%Keyd00d> monkaS
[3:04:36] <+Scevda> Grab tifa?
[3:04:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @mayorrev if you end up dating Tifa, you get some additional dialogue with her near the end of the game.
[3:04:40] <TeepPhoenix> Also, Red 13 and Barrett banged while you were asleep.
[3:04:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> honk tifa
[3:04:56] <King___Crimson> Wuh Happun
[3:04:57] <%wsintai> @TeepPhoenix It was super hot, shame Pat missed it
[3:04:58] <%SirGO0SE> when i snuck in to look at cheefas beefas sipsipHonk sipsipHonk
[3:04:58] <Valdorick> Chewie drank that Redbull13
[3:04:59] <+earthboy2k> I hope the remake gets this right
[3:05:03] <+Scevda> wha happa
[3:05:04] <Sokumotanaka> So sephiroth broke in killed the president and then left his sword in his back
[3:05:09] <ranarath> "You need to see this" cliche.
[3:05:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> big Clumbo
[3:05:20] <%arcaderabbit48> So who was on top?
[3:05:22] <%Keyd00d> come with me red bull
[3:05:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> doodNuts Hey Clumbo how you doin?
[3:05:29] <TeepPhoenix> They fought.
[3:05:30] <JoeNeutrino> Scout ahead, Red!
[3:05:31] <Teyaric> ITS A CYBORG NINJA
[3:05:32] <Basch71> take a look at THIS
[3:05:33] <+Scevda> man that guard gets more attention than some side characters
[3:05:34] <TeepPhoenix> To be on top.
[3:05:35] <%manwithboxonhead> Of course Knuckle's goes toAss4dayz first.
[3:05:42] <Valdorick> Behold - the final dungeon of the remake
[3:05:42] <%Frost_Quill> If you date Tifa it's heavily implied they fuck at the bridge scene right?
[3:05:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> HURT ME MORE, SN--I MEAN CLOUD!
[3:05:47] <%Wrashis> whats that smell? its bluuud
[3:05:52] <DirgeNovak> I hope this isn't Chris's blood
[3:05:54] <%thelaxinator> They never really talk about the robots they've been fighing this whole way
[3:05:54] <%Frost_Quill> Or like lightly implied?
[3:06:01] <+Scevda> Enough to make a man sick
[3:06:04] <%starotter70> The fuck?
[3:06:05] <%radda343> what's that smell? IT'S BLUD
[3:06:07] <Neo_Kaiser> Woof, talk about shark week
[3:06:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> God I love how the music carries over
[3:06:09] <Valdorick> Honestly, I get the feeling the remake is just going to be like, fucking Ys1 or something. 50% of the game will take place in the tower.
[3:06:10] <JoeNeutrino> What's that smell?
[3:06:11] <InugamiTheHound> sephiroth killed everyone in building
[3:06:15] <+ryosuke91kc> @Zaphire_Saucypants man ur right, this is very similar to the ninja scene
[3:06:19] <+Ell1ot> i think it's kinda weird that those things are in an office building
[3:06:19] <+ryosuke91kc> i never thought about it
[3:06:20] <+bearrier_> IZ BLUD
[3:06:23] <%StripesUltimateEdition> refuse...?
[3:06:24] <%thelaxinator> I'll just heal this full party real quick
[3:06:25] <DKDiamantes> Oh fuck, shits going down in Shinra Town
[3:06:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> re-fuse or ref-use
[3:06:29] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh wOw this art style. Like I know it's old, but this is like the worst of both worlds
[3:06:30] <TeepPhoenix> I forgot about the weird robot noise Aerith makes when she heals.
[3:06:34] <natebud> music?
[3:06:37] <+Scevda> doink*
[3:06:38] <%Frost_Quill> REFUSE
[3:06:40] <shadowcat6lives> sup pat sup chat
[3:06:41] <%Keyd00d> SPEED
[3:06:41] <$Ultradoom333> someone went Hotline Miami in here
[3:06:44] <FyreStorm640> just blew some poopy smell at you
[3:06:44] <milleniumfalcon69> how far in is the stream guys?
[3:06:45] <+Intolerable> It's funny we mentioned blood... Plague just went live.
[3:06:45] <%wsintai> @Ell1ot They make sure you dont take bathroom breaks longer than 5 minutes.
[3:06:47] <%arcaderabbit48> This ultra dramatic moment is kinda ruined by these weird floating washing machines
[3:06:54] <%yet_another_brony> but it refused
[3:06:54] <%thelaxinator> kinda breaks the tension
[3:07:01] <TeepPhoenix> It is.
[3:07:04] <+ryosuke91kc> hes fighting coffeemakers gone bad @Ell1ot it makes sense, right?
[3:07:07] <ranarath> @milleniumfalcon69 Not very far.
[3:07:09] <+ryosuke91kc> ....
[3:07:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> She's an ANDROID
[3:07:14] <jou_star> why is there so much fruit punch on the floor?
[3:07:15] <TheUltraCarl> what
[3:07:15] <DKDiamantes> This part legit freaked me out when I was a young lad
[3:07:16] <milleniumfalcon69> thanks boss
[3:07:16] <%Frost_Quill> But the future REFUSED to change.
[3:07:19] <%manwithboxonhead> I dont remember this
[3:07:20] <DirgeNovak> beep boop beep I'm Aerith
[3:07:20] <+Scevda> man, what are THOSE gonna look like in the remake
[3:07:21] <%segonian> oh no, the fart gas.
[3:07:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> Wait do you fight Jenova soon?
[3:07:22] <JoeNeutrino> What the fuck are those things and how did Hojo make them?!
[3:07:24] <MasterDecoder> OH, hey DK
[3:07:24] <ameraaaaaa> redbull is a robot!
[3:07:24] <%templar010> beep boop
[3:07:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> doodNuts M-Muther.....
[3:07:26] <%thelaxinator> Her staff kinda vibrates between two positions, I always took it that she was spinning it but it's poorly animated
[3:07:28] <Teyaric> GEAR AERIS UP BEFORE BOSS DUDE
[3:07:35] <DKDiamantes> @MasterDecoder Hola friend!
[3:07:35] <%MagickBurritoh> they spilled cool-aid
[3:07:38] <%wjones0415> that's alot of strawberry jam
[3:07:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ass4Days must be some kinda cyborg ninja
[3:07:39] <TeepPhoenix> This is some gory Resident Evil stuff
[3:07:47] <ranarath> @StrawberryPantsu No, the first Jenova fight is on a boat.
[3:07:51] <Youwereeatenbyalid> is this the work of that Sephiroth dude or somethin?
[3:07:53] <deepestdahkness> how did they sleep through this?
[3:07:53] <+Scevda> @Teyaric hopefully @AngriestPat
[3:07:59] <HeadsHeldHigh> obscure game, really
[3:08:03] <Desertfishing> it's a indie game
[3:08:03] <MasterDecoder> Damn Pat
[3:08:08] <%Keyd00d> me oto
[3:08:08] <DKDiamantes> WHAT IS THIS FUNNEL FANNY SERIES YOU SPEAK OF?
[3:08:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> First time I've heard of it
[3:08:11] <%arcaderabbit48> 4th of Juluau was a terrible idea
[3:08:12] <%GabeSweetMan> That atmosphere is solid.
[3:08:12] <%radda343> I'd never seen so much blood in a game
[3:08:13] <SaltyDongs> older than Pat
[3:08:14] <%yet_another_brony> its like ff14 but halfed
[3:08:15] <ExpressNode> It's a sleeper hit game
[3:08:18] <+Scevda> The Forest Temple was my "Freakout do no progress" moment for me
[3:08:19] <Teh_Un> Same, this part was unnerving
[3:08:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Same @AngriestPat
[3:08:22] <Neo_Kaiser> A kid? This game is 22 years old.
[3:08:25] <Teh_Un> creepy music
[3:08:25] <TheMirai> the total silence and lack o battle music helps
[3:08:30] <blackorchidKI2> What a niche game. Nobody has heard of it until it was streamed. Kappa
[3:08:31] <%Centrilion> Cant wait for this in remake, would be cool for some RE2 remake levels of gore here
[3:08:32] <Sokumotanaka> pussy
[3:08:36] <%Frost_Quill> 4kids version of FF7. "Seth" is a notorious prankster and covered all these people in strawberry jam, so now Cloud and his best buddies gotta go and put him in time out.
[3:08:38] <DKDiamantes> It was the music and the blood and the creepy fucking Jenova head that put me on edge
[3:08:39] <MetroidSlayerP7> Hojo, the ultimate bio weapon
[3:08:40] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Got that metroid fusion vibe
[3:08:41] <%segonian> ha, this the final fantasy then I guess, hahahahaha!
[3:08:47] <%topendbuzz> kid pat is such a baby
[3:08:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Also notice the CLAW marks. Very distinctly NOT human.
[3:08:53] <Koosahmii> I’m an adult and I’m freaked out right now!
[3:08:54] <+Scevda> @Frost_Quill And don't forget the impromptu naps
[3:08:56] <Desertfishing> that's the placenta dragging behind jenova
[3:09:04] <%thelaxinator> where does the sword come from
[3:09:04] <+EatinEden> I remember making my party only guys cause girls are gross
[3:09:05] <Neo_Kaiser> Long time until the nexxt save point. You ready?
[3:09:14] <%GabeSweetMan> But it was definitely Sephee tho.
[3:09:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Rest In Pieces
[3:09:14] <%Keyd00d> Skewered
[3:09:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but the sword, Pat, da swooooord.
[3:09:17] <Teyaric> He's not, he left Aeris completely ungeared
[3:09:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> Hey, whose sword is that?
[3:09:18] <Youwereeatenbyalid> is that a Samurai sword
[3:09:18] <+Itselguapo> HE DEAD!!!
[3:09:18] <TeepPhoenix> Is President Shinra OK!?
[3:09:20] <%Estuko> @GabeSweetMan I've helped customers with nails like that, they make the clack clack clack sound as they touch things LUL
[3:09:20] <+Scevda> Biggest dead ever
[3:09:21] <%segonian> quick take a nap behind this desk
[3:09:24] <reonome> SEPHIROTH
[3:09:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Mission Accomplished
[3:09:26] <+Intolerable> LIEK, SO DED
[3:09:26] <%GabeSweetMan> Not human but it was TOTALLY Sephee.
[3:09:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The Masamune
[3:09:27] <jerkhov_> sephirioth
[3:09:28] <DKDiamantes> DUN DUN DUUUUN
[3:09:29] <chad_irl> Here Barrett should go, FUCK YEAH
[3:09:29] <%wsintai> @EatinEden Gotta get those cootie nullifying accessories
[3:09:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> is that a big Sephiroth vergil dude?
[3:09:34] <%topendbuzz> ANIME
[3:09:34] <Sokumotanaka> I'm glad sephiroth left his sword here to be extra
[3:09:36] <%Yadogari> I didn't notice that chewie points his gun at him even though he is CLEARLY dead
[3:09:36] <HeadsHeldHigh> SEH FEE LOTH
[3:09:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that was the name of the sword, right?
[3:09:39] <+Ell1ot> no human could've stabbed someone with a sword!
[3:09:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> The Masamune?
[3:09:42] <%Keyd00d> yoink
[3:09:45] <TeepPhoenix> KILL HIM!
[3:09:47] <zamzoph> It's not even a real sword
[3:09:49] <+Scevda> Thats lewd
[3:09:52] <sellyourselfshort> Kill him!
[3:09:53] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh god, kill the subhuman monster!
[3:09:54] <%thelaxinator> it's like a 15 foot long folded steel katana without a sheathe, it's unclear how he transports it
[3:09:54] <Valdorick> Ah man, is that game with the white haired, black cloaked pretty boy who seeks to evolve himself to his genetic desitney and kill humanity who wronged him... Dragon Quest 4
[3:09:55] <sellyourselfshort> Kill everyone!
[3:09:56] <ranarath> @Zaphire_Saucypants yeah
[3:09:57] <%Keyd00d> I SEEN IM
[3:09:59] <%manwithboxonhead> NANI?!?!?!?
[3:09:59] <DKDiamantes> Thats an awkward time for Sephiroth to co... anyway...
[3:10:04] <+Ell1ot> stop asking the same question over and over!
[3:10:05] <JoeNeutrino> I saw him when I was buying a space.
[3:10:08] <%RupanSen> "I have the power of anime and aliens on my side"
[3:10:12] <%arcaderabbit48> "He sounded just like Superman! It was kinda hot, in a confusing why."
[3:10:19] <jou_star> yeah save sure
[3:10:20] <TeepPhoenix> KILL HIM!
[3:10:24] <%topendbuzz> wtf was that
[3:10:26] <HeadsHeldHigh> LUL that dumb animation
[3:10:28] <Sokumotanaka> @Valdorick WRONG FOOL! IT's clearly breath of fire 4
[3:10:30] <+Scevda> VP is the son? lol
[3:10:32] <TeepPhoenix> That fatass can move.
[3:10:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh get run over by a goddamn truck, Palmer.
[3:10:34] <%segonian> It was Moses!
[3:10:34] <DKDiamantes> Rufus is suave af
[3:10:35] <bear_breaker20> the promised land was actually the friends we made along the way*
[3:10:36] <jou_star> ma boi
[3:10:37] <CrypticMochi> He weilds it with the power of M-muthur
[3:10:38] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Take his SWORD
[3:10:41] <+StrawberryPantsu> Sipher?
[3:10:47] <%Keyd00d> not even cry
[3:10:48] <+StrawberryPantsu> What's he doing here
[3:10:52] <natebud> Never cried, what a badass
[3:10:52] <%thelaxinator> oh he's cried
[3:10:52] <%starotter70> Half of Palmer's body just came apart
[3:10:53] <Valdorick> @Sokumotanaka Curses! Exposed as a fake fan
[3:10:54] <%AdmiralButtloaf> hi hitler
[3:10:57] <InugamiTheHound> he gets more in advent children
[3:10:58] <%AbnormalVoid> more like Doofus
[3:10:58] <TeepPhoenix> KILL THAT FATASS
[3:10:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I feel that too
[3:10:59] <Sokumotanaka> he did in the movie
[3:11:01] <%arcaderabbit48> Not country enough, Pat
[3:11:03] <jou_star> he should've
[3:11:05] <+EatinEden> Not even a sniffle
[3:11:08] <Pat_Squared> They went so far to make him so cool and you only fight him this one time
[3:11:11] <%Keyd00d> a dog
[3:11:12] <JoeNeutrino> Rufus is intruduced as if he's going to be a threatening antagonist and then he really isn't. It's weird.
[3:11:13] <%topendbuzz> shrug
[3:11:14] <TeepPhoenix> What a motley crew.
[3:11:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "We're terrorists! :) "
[3:11:16] <%segonian> And then Moses pulled out his weeb sword and struck down the Pharoh.
[3:11:19] <DKDiamantes> You named Aerith Ass4Days?
[3:11:20] <%manwithboxonhead> We are from the Mickey Mouse Club!!!!!!
[3:11:21] <DKDiamantes> You monster
[3:11:21] <@commanderclaw> That's a fucking RPG party right there
[3:11:21] <+EthorXL> and we are, the breakfast club
[3:11:22] <natebud> Look at these chucklefucks, am i right?
[3:11:22] <+StrawberryPantsu> @AngriestPat he got a lot of play in Advent Children
[3:11:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "I was down to fuck, but not really, jklol"
[3:11:33] <DKDiamantes> Paige is a monster
[3:11:36] <%Frost_Quill> The President is dead, long live the President.
[3:11:36] <DKDiamantes> A MONSTER
[3:11:38] <+Ell1ot> Barret and Tifa just admit to being terrorists
[3:11:40] <Sokumotanaka> Rufus: You're not a clown, you're the whole circus
[3:11:40] <MasterDecoder> XD
[3:11:43] <Ion_Laser> :D
[3:11:44] <ranarath> Hopefully, Rufus will have more in the remake
[3:11:46] <%starotter70> Her true name is COOLRANCH
[3:11:47] <DKDiamantes> D'aaawwwww
[3:11:48] <%Keyd00d> just walking around
[3:11:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> adorable
[3:11:55] <Thalchampz> daaaaw
[3:11:57] <%Frost_Quill> @Ell1ot They admit to being terrorists that killed lots of people.
[3:11:58] <Youwereeatenbyalid> <3
[3:11:59] <%Edgy_Macaroon> ain't that sweet
[3:12:06] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh
[3:12:10] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[3:12:17] <deepestdahkness> that's actually harder, rufus
[3:12:18] <TeepPhoenix> You know, Barrett or Cloud could probably splatter Rufus right now while he's yakking.
[3:12:20] <%manwithboxonhead> Ahhhhh
[3:12:23] <natebud> This Aeris name is going to pay off much later
[3:12:28] <%Keyd00d> I'll control the world with fear, unlike my father who dropped an entire plate on thousands of people
[3:12:31] <+Ell1ot> this is a real crisis core for the planet
[3:12:37] <%Keyd00d> that didn't scare anybody
[3:12:39] <%thelaxinator> rufus is pretty cool in advent children
[3:12:40] <Gerik1233> I've always like the theory that Rufus was secretly a good guy.
[3:12:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ...that orange hair...that attitude...jesus christ, the parallels are SLIGHTLY uncanny.
[3:12:41] <TeepPhoenix> Hell, even Tifa could.
[3:12:42] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ...what do you expect to happen here?
[3:12:43] <%manwithboxonhead> I would get Ass4dayz in for a while.
[3:12:52] <King_thunder365> @Ell1ot I appreciate that joke.
[3:12:52] <SleepyMaribo> Pat aboutto have a real bad time
[3:12:56] <CrypticMochi> I kinda wanted her to be Big Puss
[3:13:08] <JoeNeutrino> @Zaphire_Saucypants They're really not.
[3:13:22] <Sokumotanaka> God tifa's such a sakura
[3:13:29] <TeepPhoenix> Oh hey, here comes the fight scene from Hobbs and Shaw almost 30 years early.
[3:13:42] <%thelaxinator> time for barret to carry the team in a ranged-only boss fight
[3:13:47] <Edible_Enthusiasm> spoilerrrs :P
[3:13:56] <InugamiTheHound> what does elemental materia do?
[3:14:09] <TeepPhoenix> A E R I T H
[3:14:12] <%yet_another_brony> whos that
[3:14:21] <%yet_another_brony> dont you mean
[3:14:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> doesn't elemental add the elemental effect of a Materia to a weapon or armor
[3:14:23] <TeepPhoenix> It adds your elemental attack
[3:14:27] <natebud> just press up
[3:14:28] <alrobot2014> A S S 4 D A Y S
[3:14:28] <%yet_another_brony> ass4dayz
[3:14:30] <%RupanSen> or defense
[3:14:30] <%arcaderabbit48> Elevator Tank, I guess!
[3:14:31] <%Keyd00d> time for a long elevator ride
[3:14:34] <%Tyonidus> YEEE I love you Pat
[3:14:36] <TeepPhoenix> Hobbs and Shaw, like I said.
[3:14:38] <%Tyonidus> you're the big cool man
[3:14:38] <ranarath> Gotta shoot out the glass
[3:14:38] <%starotter70> It's great
[3:14:38] <groovykrovvy> you can put it on armor to resist the element
[3:14:39] <+Intolerable> A E R I S
[3:14:39] <miendrh93> It makes it so your weapon gives off the same magic as the materia, and your armor protects against it.
[3:14:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Bad ass.
[3:14:40] <%templar010> PS1 Effects PogChamp
[3:14:41] <deepestdahkness> elemental adds elements to your weapon and resistance to your armor
[3:14:46] <HeadsHeldHigh> pushing the ps1 to the limit
[3:14:46] <mybigmeech> This is gonna be awesome in remake
[3:14:47] <Sokumotanaka> Just a random tank in an elevator
[3:14:51] <Edible_Enthusiasm> for defense or offense purposes, depending on what you equip it to.
[3:14:58] <%segonian> dead
[3:15:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Totally generic design, but the LOCATION makes it so unique.
[3:15:04] <Edible_Enthusiasm> why is there a tank in the elevator
[3:15:05] <Desertfishing> i had to do this fight with barret only when i first played
[3:15:09] <%thelaxinator> I forgot this boss was regular battle music
[3:15:14] <rodrigo3z> yo first time here,huge fan
[3:15:18] <Canti58> @AngriestPat I haven't played this game in about 10 years but the fact that you link materia green to blue instead of blue to green upsets me and I don't know why
[3:15:23] <%RupanSen> Weak against Serah
[3:15:26] <Edible_Enthusiasm> no raaaaange
[3:15:28] <%GabeSweetMan> No ground attacks.
[3:15:31] <Desertfishing> didnt equip materia
[3:15:40] <42nfl19> imagine this in the remake
[3:15:41] <Sokumotanaka> @mybigmeech Since they want the story to make SENSE I doubt it'll be there. If not majorly altered to have a reason
[3:15:42] <+Itselguapo> This fight in the remake but you have to jump from elevator to elevator since the big ol robot will do big ol AOE's
[3:15:49] <Desertfishing> i was a babby at the time
[3:15:57] <+itz_dono> I remember playing this the first time and having nearly no range. brutal
[3:16:06] <natebud> he was desertfishing jr
[3:16:13] <%GabeSweetMan> This boss caught me off guard my first time. Second round went much better.
[3:16:17] <Edible_Enthusiasm> but why pat, why
[3:16:18] <Applecannon63> what if in the remake you the two bosses at the same time?
[3:16:20] <deepestdahkness> all works with cover as well
[3:16:21] <%starotter70> oh shit yeah, how is this fight going to be done in the remake?
[3:16:23] <%radda343> blue supports green, that's how it works, mind gobalins said so
[3:16:23] <groovykrovvy> there are people who put blue first?
[3:16:25] <mybigmeech> @sokumotanaka Well hopefully there is still a elevator fight of some sorts
[3:16:29] <%thelaxinator> oh man, it took me 20 years to realize that "big shot" was a pun between being a big shot and firing a large bullet
[3:16:31] <GustauveVIII> you can link blue to red or green
[3:16:32] <TeepPhoenix> So I've always wondered, how exactly does Aeris make her staff float when she casts a spell?
[3:16:44] <natebud> magnets
[3:16:45] <%Keyd00d> magic
[3:16:46] <%radda343> magic
[3:16:48] <Edible_Enthusiasm> sensor cannon you say
[3:16:49] <%wjones0415> blue supports green, red and yellow
[3:16:50] <Applecannon63> magick
[3:16:52] <MetroidSlayerP7> Blue+blue Kappa
[3:16:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Lifestream
[3:16:56] <%starotter70> With her ass
[3:16:57] <HollowMan190> dose anyone atactally think they will make it though to the end with the remake
[3:16:57] <Canti58> @AngriestPat it's like seeing someone play RE4 with a horribly organized attache case
[3:16:58] <%RupanSen> nanomachines
[3:16:58] <HeadsHeldHigh> ez
[3:16:59] <Valdorick> Its in her DNA
[3:17:01] <TeepPhoenix> SHE'S NOT THAT MAGIC!
[3:17:02] <Edible_Enthusiasm> is there a float materia
[3:17:05] <%bread_assassin> @thelaxinator I was today years old when I realized that.
[3:17:07] <Sokumotanaka> @mybigmeech It's just barret and The turks pressing the button to race towards the bottom to get out first XD
[3:17:07] <%Sh00s> how do u do magic when ur doing magic, dawg?\

[3:23:41] <Aji__> Motorball doe @wrashis
[3:23:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> I just learned from the wiki that FFVII is set in the far off future of 2004
[3:23:46] <%ShichiNoBushi> And he leaves on a helicopter like Lan Di. It would be hillarious if that would be the last you see of him in the Remake Part 1.
[3:23:47] <Valdorick> The real question is - will the escape from the city be the ending of the remake?
[3:23:49] <groovykrovvy> its very episodic

[3:24:12] <RagingLeo> yeah not like 24 hours or something like Gigaboots did in their single sitting run stream
[3:24:14] <%radda343> I bet the remake ends with a big dumb fight against Sephiroth

[3:26:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> fucking Sick
[3:26:06] <DKDiamantes> I want to laugh
[3:26:07] <%Keyd00d> it's gonna end on a weird minigame
[3:26:08] <DirgeNovak> 100%
[3:26:10] <jou_star> the best
[3:26:10] <disflipmat> Yeah, this'll definitely be the finale to part 1
[3:26:12] <Theonlypegsus> Mini games!?
[3:26:13] <Theonlypegsus> Holy shit
[3:26:14] <+earthboy2k> SourPls
[3:26:14] <%logoth_> weird minigame + Boss
[3:26:14] <Desertfishing> this size of everything makes no sense how big is that building and how big are the vehicles lol
[3:26:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmmm very likely
[3:26:17] <%Tyonidus> the first part? what do you mean?
[3:26:18] <%Keeble24> Tifa’s honkers transcend space and time
[3:26:22] <Darkfire346> they should end it after the nibelheim flashback
[3:26:22] <%GabeSweetMan> This is absolutely going to be fully expanded.
[3:26:22] <TeepPhoenix> I wanted Red XIII to be theone driving.
[3:26:22] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat They'll probably have a different final boss than this highway one
[3:26:25] <fazoburquina> SourPls SourPls vineLucas
[3:26:28] <%Wrashis> the game is episodic
[3:26:28] <HeadsHeldHigh> LUL
[3:26:30] <SleepyMaribo> set up materia
[3:26:31] <mayorrev> i belive the boss after this brief sequence will do it yeah
[3:26:31] <%arcaderabbit48> @Keyd00d Well there is a boss fight after this
[3:26:31] <+RealPT1> the no SFX felt weird to me at the time but now I know that fmvs were early at the time for square
[3:26:32] <EuropanLamprey> Didn't know they master jiggle physics in 97
[3:26:32] <+EatinEden> what is that 9 hours? Didn’t they say they’d stretch it out to 60?
[3:26:36] <%Wrashis> the first game will end here
[3:26:38] <DirgeNovak> Part two coming on PlayStation 6 in 2035
[3:26:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> them leaving Midgar, actually
[3:26:42] <+buffn99> They could always make a new place for it to end
[3:26:45] <%arkv01> >abandon friends>continue quest solo
[3:26:46] <Dreigun> I want to hear the remake's version of this song
[3:26:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> will probably be where it leaves off
[3:26:50] <%Keyd00d> I kinda want it to end with the flashback in the next town but that's probably too much to ask
[3:26:56] <%radda343> man you really like rearranging your matiera
[3:26:57] <+dickbuttboss> doodWAT
[3:26:57] <%Tyonidus> @Wrashis my dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I can't believe I haven't heard that until now.
[3:27:00] <mybigmeech> @tyonidus Everything till now is considered its own game in remake
[3:27:01] <el_patronn64> Makes sense when you leave midgar
[3:27:04] <%Tyonidus> ALL THIS TIME AND THE GAME IS EPISODIC REEEEEEE
[3:27:05] <b_ikki> kalm would be the best bit to end it on yeah
[3:27:06] <shiny_prinny> @keyd00d same
[3:27:06] <Darkfire346> Part 3 with the final boss will be released as Epic Store exclusive
[3:27:08] <%Frost_Quill> It's gonna end with them at that cliff when they escape the city.
[3:27:08] <Neo_Kaiser> If you turn off encounters this game is only 9 hours long.
[3:27:12] <InugamiTheHound> yeah the boss at the end can be a bitch. Because if you get hurt in this mini game everyone is hurt during the boss fight
[3:27:14] <TeepPhoenix> I'm worried they'll make the entire Nibelheim flashback it's own part.
[3:27:18] <groovykrovvy> 9 hours with mostly popeye arms with text boxes and some prerendered cutscenes
[3:27:18] <%ShichiNoBushi> Elemental needs to be linked.
[3:27:26] <%SirGO0SE> end with tifas speed bumps going over speed bumps on motorcycle for entire credit sequence pls
[3:27:28] <%arkv01> @TeepPhoenix nah too short
[3:27:31] <DKDiamantes> Of course its Episodic, how else will they milk their cash cow for all its worth?
[3:27:34] <+ultimafullmetal> I could see the first Jenova fight being at the end of the remake instead of the tanker.
[3:27:44] <%arkv01> @TeepPhoenix its like 1.5hours at most
[3:27:49] <+Shockrates20XX> Well you should at least equip Sense on somebody. You'll need to max it for master Command materia.
[3:27:50] <Valdorick> The second game is likely to start off In medias res with Cloud's backstory (just cut out the walk to the town)
[3:27:53] <natebud> Man I forgot how evil red13 looks in that art
[3:27:54] <TeepPhoenix> Yes, that's why I'm worried.
[3:27:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> it'll be done by the time the 30th anniversary
[3:27:56] <mayorrev> DAYTONAAAAAA
[3:27:57] <+prism_zet> "only" 9 hours
[3:27:58] <groovykrovvy> the end of Midgar has enough material for a whole modern game
[3:27:59] <+mjkenney24> have they really not fixed the music bug in the ps4 version?
[3:28:01] <InugamiTheHound> red 13's icon in this sequence looks so bad
[3:28:03] <Theonlypegsus> Holy shit I didn't know this was in this game!
[3:28:04] <%Keyd00d> AWKWARD
[3:28:05] <%arcaderabbit48> Well each episode si going to be expanded out to its own huge game, so its not like we're getting the short end of the stick on content
[3:28:06] <EuropanLamprey> OH god it's Ride to Hell
[3:28:07] <+Pixel_Matt> Look at this videogame!
[3:28:07] <+Grayhammatter> good lord
[3:28:09] <Theonlypegsus> What the fuck!?
[3:28:09] <%thelaxinator> You can do this later in the gold saucer
[3:28:12] <+EatinEden> I expect nothing but perfection if their gonna milk it like that
[3:28:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mhm
[3:28:13] <%Keyd00d> omg pat
[3:28:16] <Ion_Laser> Spread the remake out into episodes, then release a collector's edition with all of the episodes later!
[3:28:18] <natebud> Hitsparks4dayz
[3:28:18] <%doug_famous> Just hit them, Pat
[3:28:19] <%arkv01> pat FRENS ARE DYING
[3:28:20] <%Yadogari> Just hit them Pat
[3:28:20] <%thelaxinator> I bet you all forgot about snowboarding
[3:28:22] <groovykrovvy> better than ride to hell
[3:28:24] <Edible_Enthusiasm> did you know there was a Japanese phone game that was just a remastered version of this minigame.
[3:28:25] <Neo_Kaiser> This minigame is cool, except for near the end when the camera changes for no reason.
[3:28:30] <+Ell1ot> if only someone had a gun!
[3:28:30] <blackorchidKI2> There needs to be an Akira powerslide somewhere at the end of this.
[3:28:34] <TeepPhoenix> YOU JUST HAD TO FOLLOW THE TRAIN CJ
[3:28:34] <EuropanLamprey> It's Ride to Hell but it plays better
[3:28:34] <+Grayhammatter> i hope it fucking plays better than this
[3:28:37] <%Keyd00d> I almost feel like Fort Condor will be completely cut
[3:28:41] <42nfl19> Do you know what would be helpful? If a certain someone with a gun HELPED OUT
[3:28:44] <%starotter70> Doesn't the damage transfer over to the boss fight?
[3:28:48] <%Starlight_Gamer> road rash
[3:28:54] <+dickbuttboss> You think they'll introduce Red IX sooner in the Remake?
[3:28:54] <%arkv01> I think barrets shooting but uhhh its hard to aim on a truck
[3:28:57] <%thelaxinator> the snowboarding minigame happens almost immediately after the big spoiler, in case you forgot

[3:29:05] <TeepPhoenix> He's not even driving.
[3:29:05] <%segonian> this is rad
[3:29:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Look Barret's helping. LIke that matters.
[3:29:16] <TeepPhoenix> He's sitting in the back with damn red 13
[3:29:18] <b_ikki> dont pat pls him this shit sucks
[3:29:20] <+EthorXL> the gold saucer in the remake should have a retro room with all the original versions of the mini-games
[3:29:24] <%QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> but who would design a road like this
[3:29:25] <+bearrier_> me and the boys on our way to help kill 30-50 feral hogs
[3:29:26] <groovykrovvy> so many minigames in ff7
[3:29:32] <MetroidSlayerP7> Character icons look different
[3:29:33] <%doug_famous> look at those textures
[3:29:35] <%GabeSweetMan> @EthorXL A+ absolutely
[3:29:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he's shooting his gun. Probably does shit all in this sequence.
[3:29:38] <%arkv01> 30-50 3rd class soldiers ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[3:29:41] <Valdorick> Hot take - Gold Saucer won't even be in the remake Kappa
[3:29:44] <natebud> life is a fuck. 410,132,445 dead shinra
[3:29:45] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Why does this highway have no off-ramps
[3:29:46] <mayorrev> nyooooom
[3:29:47] <%thelaxinator> Godbert had better be in the FF7 gold saucer
[3:29:48] <b_ikki> it was the future
[3:29:50] <HeadsHeldHigh> Dynamic camera angles
[3:29:52] <%arkv01> VROOM
[3:29:55] <groovykrovvy> like THIS shit is like the san andreas final chase
[3:29:59] <DirgeNovak> t h r e e d e e
[3:30:01] <%arkv01> BOSS TIME BOYS
[3:30:01] <%AdmiralButtloaf> THE FINAL BOSS!
[3:30:01] <%Keyd00d> PogChamp
[3:30:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls
[3:30:02] <+quinnage7> You can only do this minigame here
[3:30:04] <b_ikki> skrrr
[3:30:05] <%GabeSweetMan> ROAD ROLLAH DAAAA
[3:30:07] <%arkv01> that was hype
[3:30:08] <%Yadogari> SUPLEX IT
[3:30:09] <%segonian> road ends
[3:30:09] <juanrock89> remake's final boss
[3:30:12] <b_ikki> SourPls
[3:30:12] <%arkv01> now EVEN BIGGER HYPE
[3:30:13] <%Wrashis> you can do it again in gold saucer
[3:30:15] <TeepPhoenix> I'll surprised if Cait Sith is even a PC in the remake. He'll probably be an NPC with some strange minigame mechanics.
[3:30:17] <SleepyMaribo> i suggest healing for youe first move
[3:30:18] <Canti58> it's "The Butt Crusher"
[3:30:19] <Valdorick> Double Hot Take - Gold Saucer's games will be paid DLC Kappa
[3:30:20] <%starotter70> It does
[3:30:21] <+Grayhammatter> wow, knuckles is fucked
[3:30:21] <%QUOTE_ME_IF_HE_DOES_IT> bonk
[3:30:22] <%Ilpala> WRYYYYYYYYYY
[3:30:22] <%Keyd00d> knuckles got fuckled
[3:30:22] <+quinnage7> That thing is probably gonna chase you around in the remake
[3:30:22] <InugamiTheHound> cloud and crew be riding dirty!
[3:30:23] <%Yadogari> 18 LUL
[3:30:24] <EuropanLamprey> Gotta stop before you drive into the Infinite Abyss
[3:30:24] <b_ikki> there's no way this guy is the final boss
[3:30:24] <natebud> he attac
[3:30:25] <groovykrovvy> they have an arcade in golden saucer for the bike, right?
[3:30:26] <%segonian> dead
[3:30:27] <mayorrev> yeah remake's final boss by the looks of it
[3:30:27] <b_ikki> they're gonna change it
[3:30:30] <%bevyrage> @quinnage7 you can also do the minigame in the flying saucer later on
[3:30:31] <Mitchellsocks> There are so many bosses in this segment, it's rediculous
[3:30:33] <%Keyd00d> look how DUMB it is
[3:30:35] <Edible_Enthusiasm> big multihit miss
[3:30:37] <%TheTakkster> I feel like they'll have something else here for the finale
[3:30:38] <groovykrovvy> TANK KNIGHT
[3:30:39] <+buffn99> I really doubt this will be the final boss for part 1, too lame
[3:30:40] <+RealPT1> really wanted to put one over on that Chrono cross race sequence
[3:30:43] <%arkv01> its just GUNTANK
[3:30:45] <natebud> What a dumb final boss for the remake. Can't wait
[3:30:47] <%AdmiralButtloaf> this loser is the final boss
[3:30:49] <%arkv01> er slashtank
[3:30:51] <%thelaxinator> those wheels aren't asphalt safe
[3:30:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> after this'll probably be a good stop for the stream.
[3:30:58] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> This will be the 1st boss, then we'll flashback
[3:30:58] <EuropanLamprey> @AngriestPat Did you enjoy Ride to Hell but better?
[3:30:59] <%Truunbeaten> Truunbeaten subscribed at Tier 2. 
[3:30:59] <TeepPhoenix> The Turks are going to be riding that thing in the Remake and taunting Cloud.
[3:31:01] <natebud> poison that machine
[3:31:03] <groovykrovvy> bio doesnt work on robots
[3:31:03] <%AbnormalVoid> poison the robot
[3:31:06] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL
[3:31:07] <%arcaderabbit48> I dont know, I think the remake could do something interestign with this boss. Tank Knight Centaur isn't a terrible idea for a boss
[3:31:08] <Neo_Kaiser> You can't poison a robot!
[3:31:09] <hippieofdeath> YEs PAt, pioson the giant car
[3:31:09] <%arkv01> yeah pats def gonna stop after we leave midgar
[3:31:09] <artificiallynatural> what an incredible final boss
[3:31:11] <+dickbuttboss> I ain't gonna lie, This thing does not feel like it should be the last boss of the first part of the Remake.
[3:31:13] <%Wrashis> i mean hes about to beat the game so of course hell stop it here
[3:31:13] <Valdorick> Stop the stream only after we hear that overworld music. That shit slaps
[3:31:14] <groovykrovvy> but do it anyway
[3:31:18] <+Ell1ot> does bio work on robots?
[3:31:20] <chronoxgp> i dunno this game has a lot of the 80's aesthetic
[3:31:22] <Basch71> its kinda hilarious most of the garlean robot bosses in 14 don't look much different than this design LuL
[3:31:24] <%segonian> poison the robot Pat.
[3:31:25] <%arkv01> @dickbuttboss yeah but the game wasn't originally in parts
[3:31:27] <DKDiamantes> They're gonna figure out some convoluted way to make a Sephiroth end battle for the end of the first game.
[3:31:28] <%arkv01> so it'll have to do
[3:31:28] <natebud> Final boss, MOTOR BALL
[3:31:33] <%doug_famous> Shinra: What if built a tank and put arms on it but then we put swords on those arms?
[3:31:38] <TeepPhoenix> So call forth the main chracter of FF13.
[3:31:40] <%arcaderabbit48> Come to think of it, the Remake will probably have Rufus pilot this thing
[3:31:44] <TeepPhoenix> Since it is weak to her.
[3:31:45] <peanutandbuttershow> Fuck yea Elmo. :D
[3:31:45] <groovykrovvy> this is why i usually buy like three bolts
[3:31:47] <disflipmat> @Ell1ot Nope, I know for a fact cause last time I did this I had Cloud with bio-elemental on his weapon and couldn't do shit
[3:31:49] <mayorrev> what does bio do
[3:31:51] <+Grayhammatter> seems legit
[3:31:57] <Valdorick> The final boss will Sepharoth sitting inside this tank like Dr Robtnik.
[3:31:58] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Oh I see the new anthem patch is looking a bit experimental
[3:32:02] <+dickbuttboss> Maybe incorporate in like a big finale but not just by itself
[3:32:02] <TeepPhoenix> Or Reno or Rude.
[3:32:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @mayorrev poison
[3:32:03] <InugamiTheHound> hurts and poisons them
[3:32:03] <%logoth_> "Its not OVAH YET"
[3:32:04] <%Keyd00d> probably
[3:32:04] <%Goobbue> Goobbue subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:32:06] <mayorrev> oohh
[3:32:07] <%arkv01> no thats stupid, rufus is too cool to pilot this
[3:32:13] <TeepPhoenix> Or Palmer or Heidegger
[3:32:13] <+prism_zet> poison status
[3:32:15] <%arkv01> unless they replace this with a mech tank
[3:32:18] <Valdorick> They could have Heidegger do it.
[3:32:25] <natebud> I kind of like Rufus just getting bored and flying away.
[3:32:26] <Valdorick> Since he pilots that mecha later on anyway.
[3:32:27] <%RupanSen> Nah, I think they're gonna be two separate battles with Rufus at the end
[3:32:28] <%logoth_> That looks dumb
[3:32:29] <TeepPhoenix> GYA HA HA HA!
[3:32:29] <groovykrovvy> burnout
[3:32:29] <%Nekemancer> Yes, because Poison is so good against machines
[3:32:30] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit
[3:32:30] <peanutandbuttershow> Man. I love this game.
[3:32:30] <%republicofu> its a robot pat
[3:32:33] <b_ikki> air hockey ass shit
[3:32:33] <Mitchellsocks> Rufus would totally pilot, he's nerd cool

[3:32:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> get this man some flex tape
[3:32:38] <+Shockrates20XX> I hope they don't have Rufus furiously rampaging after you. Cool thing about him is how he stays cool.

[3:34:15] <+quinnage7> DA END
[3:34:17] <%thelaxinator> end of the road
[3:34:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> >>>To Be Continued
[3:34:21] <natebud> "I don't know, motor ball seems like a good place to end"
[3:34:29] <DKDiamantes> Load up your save from right before the Rufus fight and grind for optional DLC boss
[3:34:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> deadbeat dad
[3:34:31] <+SuperBloodWolfMoon> Midgar in a scene: A highway that goes literally nowhere.
[3:34:32] <Desertfishing> they should get parachutes in the remake
[3:34:33] <Ion_Laser> Cut to TO BE CONTINUED
[3:34:36] <%Wrashis> this would actually be an ok scene to end on
[3:34:43] <peanutandbuttershow> Can't wait for remake... I ain't that poor. ;)
[3:34:51] <TheHotStuven> $60 FOR THIS NotLikeThis
[3:34:52] <Valdorick> The one thing I'm going to be sad about in the remake, more than anything... NO OVERWORLD MAP... Dicks out and Fs for Overworld maps F
[3:34:53] <%Keyd00d> see ya fuckers
[3:34:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> that is 100% an ending.
[3:34:59] <TeepPhoenix> I really want them to finish the Remake, just so we can see how they show the Supernova attack.
[3:35:00] <ranarath> F
[3:35:06] <+Ell1ot> Barret has upgraded from local terrorist to world wide terrorist.
[3:35:07] <mayorrev> how many discs is this gonna have
[3:35:07] <%vectorless_peon> now to EXPOSITION TOWN!
[3:35:08] <mayorrev> 3?
[3:35:09] <+quinnage7> END OF PART 1
[3:35:10] <Mitchellsocks> Maybe they'll make more of the Rufus boss, and begin with motorball and chase
[3:35:16] <milleniumfalcon69> F
[3:35:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> time for get Vinnie and some thieving little shit
[3:35:19] <chronoxgp> the rest of the game is kinda boring lol
[3:35:24] <peanutandbuttershow> Got this on steam. Love ya'll
[3:35:26] <Sedrelic> - 100 tifa points
[3:35:28] <+EatinEden> xqcSad
[3:35:28] <%arcaderabbit48> Its mostly that shot that at the end that makes me think its the stopping point. Having the credits roll after the characters look out over the sunrise on a new horizon towards the outside world is cinematic as fuck
[3:35:30] <%vectorless_peon> Pat get the underware i sware to Job
[3:35:33] <Mitchellsocks> Most of my replays end here honestly
[3:35:44] <b_ikki> we're going for barret obviously right
[3:35:45] <Mitchellsocks> It's such a perfect segment of the game
[3:35:47] <+Grayhammatter> Mrs. Ass4Dayz
[3:35:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Let's mosey
[3:35:48] <%arkv01> oh yeah, aeris is totally the only city person in the party right now
[3:35:49] <TeepPhoenix> This is the line that utterly fucked up Aerith's character in Crisis Core.
[3:35:51] <juanrock89> it's gonna be fine aerith, nothing bad's gonna happen
[3:35:54] <katocrimson> waifu team
[3:35:59] <mayorrev> punch the ait
[3:36:01] <Louie_Salmon> Such weird perspective on this shot
[3:36:01] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Never seen this game before
[3:36:02] <peanutandbuttershow> Love how Elmo is Tha Boss!!!
[3:36:02] <natebud> And NOT the mass murderer
[3:36:04] <%Keyd00d> dayum
[3:36:12] <projecthazoid> You and 57% of other players looked at the map of Midgard with Tifa

[3:36:24] <%thelaxinator> calm. the exposition dump
[3:36:24] <Mitchellsocks> Barret will remember this
[3:36:25] <%radda343> don't split the party dumb dumb
[3:36:25] <%arkv01> here, take this samsung galaxy 9
[3:36:27] <TeepPhoenix> YAY
[3:36:29] <%arkv01> so we can contact each other
[3:36:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nah, Chewie has leadership experience
[3:36:30] <%Keyd00d> one and only party
[3:36:35] <%starotter70> That's the one
[3:36:35] <Neo_Kaiser> Special dialogue here if you have an all boys or all girls team
[3:36:38] <mayorrev> aw
[3:36:39] <Pat_Squared> you best get that matra magic as soon as you step outside
[3:36:44] <redial_nick> you mean like a zapping system Kappa
[3:36:44] <smugjorgen> 2 parties stronger then 1 big boy strong party
[3:36:45] <chronoxgp> they could've lowered the bike with that hook lol
[3:36:45] <mayorrev> i'm gonna miss barret
[3:36:45] <+EatinEden> Oh god, they better not add phones in remake
[3:36:46] <TeepPhoenix> Is the end of the stream?
[3:36:46] <blackorchidKI2> Aaand end
[3:36:48] <DirgeNovak> It's too dangerous for five people, let's split up into smaller groups
[3:36:50] <Mitchellsocks> OVERWORLD THEME
[3:36:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> k boomer
[3:36:53] <%arkv01> I think it blew ALL of us
[3:36:54] <Desertfishing> yup same here
[3:36:55] <%arcaderabbit48> Also ending there means Disc 2 is going to open on this!
[3:36:56] <natebud> change the camera angle
[3:36:57] <%GabeSweetMan> Everyone's head ASLPODE
[3:36:58] <DKDiamantes> Saaaaame
[3:36:58] <%arkv01> like WHOA, what is this mode
[3:36:59] <InugamiTheHound> same here dude
[3:37:00] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Pat was a dumb kid
[3:37:01] <groovykrovvy> a whole huge world
[3:37:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what? They had phoones dude
[3:37:03] <MoonObscure> yup
[3:37:04] <%GabeSweetMan> This was so NUTS to me.
[3:37:08] <peanutandbuttershow> I want to see yo women play DS2 SOTF.
[3:37:08] <%Keyd00d> all that in that tiny circle
[3:37:09] <%Starlight_Gamer> tutorial over
[3:37:09] <%arkv01> and that midgar world map model is
[3:37:09] <+Grayhammatter> but did it blow you?
[3:37:10] <%republicofu> THAT WAS THE FIRST TOWN!!!!
[3:37:10] <reonome> -END OF REMAKE PART 1-
[3:37:11] <%arkv01> REALLY COOL
[3:37:11] <%Frost_Quill> How far did you think you were?
[3:37:12] <%Owkono> you can trap yourself
[3:37:14] <%logoth_> I wish the entire game was midgar
[3:37:14] <%SirGO0SE> apatHoldon
[3:37:16] <%Keyd00d> LOOK AT THIS MAP
[3:37:16] <mayorrev> ZA WORLDO
[3:37:17] <natebud> we goin
[3:37:18] <+EatinEden> they had phones??? xqcOld
[3:37:18] <%Tyonidus> YES THAT'S HOW EVERYBODY FELT THEN BRAIN BLOW UP
[3:37:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> like, they actually had mobile phones.
[3:37:19] <Valdorick> Look at this fucking Fetus, not thinking the Bridge getting repaired in Final Fantasy 1 was the ending.
[3:37:22] <InugamiTheHound> 3 discs also blew my mind because more games are 1 disc back in the day
[3:37:24] <%logoth_> Midgar is so much more interesting than the rest of the world
[3:37:24] <natebud> L1 i think
[3:37:27] <DKDiamantes> They just don't make em like they used to.
[3:37:34] <+dickbuttboss> Home is behind you... The world is ahead...
[3:37:34] <thetyrantcbass> Yeah, the PHS is a phone
[3:37:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> Kreygasm
[3:37:38] <%thelaxinator> the world map is actually just a very well presented linear hallway, but it FEELS AMAZING
[3:37:39] <groovykrovvy> patrician camera angle
[3:37:40] <%arkv01> @DKDiamantes they really don't... I think we need to reset the clock on humanity
[3:37:41] <Jolly_Adventurer> How long was that midgar section? 7 hours?
[3:37:45] <%Keyd00d> this theme is soooo GOOD
[3:37:45] <mayorrev> imagine them walking all this distance
[3:37:49] <%Wrashis> we beat the game
[3:37:50] <+Itselguapo> I honestly think squenix is lying about FF7 remake ONLY being in midgar....
[3:37:51] <@CoalSavoie> When I was a kid, I thought the world map would be jumping from sectors in Midgar and that's where the whole game took place
[3:37:52] <+faithless_zealot> D:
[3:37:52] <natebud> See you when remake comes out guys
[3:37:54] <Edible_Enthusiasm> aww
[3:37:56] <+Grayhammatter> fuck, i missed the whole stream
[3:37:59] <b_ikki> thanks for playing part 1 of the final fantasy vii remake
[3:38:01] <+Itselguapo> it's too fucking weird to think about that being an entire game..
[3:38:05] <b_ikki> see you in 2024
[3:38:07] <%starotter70> These are really chill streams
[3:38:08] <mayorrev> should i buy it on switch
[3:38:09] <MetroidSlayerP7> Theme is so soft and quiet... for now
[3:38:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> After FF3/6, I was ready for pretty much anything.
[3:38:11] <mayorrev> tempted
[3:38:11] <juanrock89> 5 hours seems short for a full game
[3:38:13] <zamzoph> 9's better tho
[3:38:17] <+peppament> Don't forget about Yuffie
[3:38:17] <%AdmiralButtloaf> @but pat you gotta steal the ballhand from the robot centaurs
[3:38:18] <%Keyd00d> wait for that crescendo
[3:38:23] <%arcaderabbit48> @thelaxinator A lot of FF maps are like that actually. The only thing that really varies is how well they hide the linearity.
[3:38:25] <groovykrovvy> just the part 1 remake will be 40 to 60 hours a least
[3:38:25] <Mitchellsocks> Midgard FEELS like an entire game. Same length as a DMC, lmao
[3:38:28] <natebud> Be sure to buy the season pass
[3:38:29] <%AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat but pat you gotta steal the ballhand from the robot centaurs
[3:38:29] <peanutandbuttershow> I do love this game. :X
[3:38:34] <DKDiamantes> It sure as shit is
[3:38:34] <chad_irl> I fully expect Metal Wolf XD on stream later
[3:38:34] <%Keyd00d> noice
[3:38:35] <%Frost_Quill> @juanrock89 They're gonna pad the FUCK out of the remake.
[3:38:38] <Valdorick> Thinking on it - maybe they'll reuse abunch of the possible assets from FF15's city section that never happened.
[3:38:44] <mayorrev> wholesome <3
[3:38:47] <smugjorgen> do you think yuffiw will be in part 1 of remake
[3:38:50] <MoonObscure> yes .w. the memories...
[3:38:51] <%starotter70> Yeah
[3:38:51] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Heart2 heart2Eundori heart2Saebom heart2Kigom heart2Heart2
[3:38:52] <natebud> that some wholesome shit
[3:38:52] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Feels so good
[3:38:54] <InugamiTheHound> all ff games are linear but only 13 did you see the linear of the map
[3:38:57] <peanutandbuttershow> Fuck yea.
[3:39:02] <%ReenMan350> ReenMan350 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[3:39:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Thing is a lot of people could argue the game doesn't even really start until you get outta Midgar
[3:39:06] <%bevyrage> when i was a kid i'd listen to this music when it was hard to fall asleep
[3:39:06] <%RupanSen> VII main theme is unironically one of my favorite pieces of music of all time
[3:39:07] <TeepPhoenix> Will Cait Sith even be playble in the remake?
[3:39:09] <%bevyrage> good times
[3:39:09] <+Quadralatus> HI PAT <3
[3:39:10] <%arkv01> why yes, please make red13 THICC with padding
[3:39:11] <Ion_Laser> Gotta milk that nostalgia somehow...
[3:39:11] <Mitchellsocks> I'm very excited for a d d i t i o n a l c o n t e n t
[3:39:12] <LLZeroX> we already know that the sewer under Don Corneo's is going from literally one screen to an entire huge area
[3:39:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 1997 was a damn good year. This music just brings it all back.
[3:39:15] <TeepPhoenix> NAME HIM CAIT SITH
[3:39:15] <%arcaderabbit48> @InugamiTheHound FFX is a great game, but it is also a straight line for 95% of it
[3:39:16] <AMUSERNAME> Kreygasm this part
[3:39:17] <+Ell1ot> name your new dog redbull
[3:39:21] <peanutandbuttershow> Aww Tha Baby!!!
[3:39:21] <DKDiamantes> Heart warming
[3:39:26] <%Keyd00d> Kreygasm
[3:39:27] <Valdorick> Choke on that PAINT
[3:39:28] <%doug_famous> Do you think they'll do an overworld in the remake?
[3:39:28] <%QueequegTheater> ATB still sucks
[3:39:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Thanks for streamin
[3:39:32] <%QueequegTheater> Hoes still mad
[3:39:33] <groovykrovvy> i dont think it even needs padding with a modern remake
[3:39:36] <+EatinEden> jnbAw
[3:39:38] <+dickbuttboss> doodNuts
[3:39:41] <DKDiamantes> Grandia franchise makes me feel like such an old fuck
[3:39:43] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Grandia 1 was my childhood
[3:39:43] <%segonian> Dreamcast
[3:39:44] <peanutandbuttershow> Mwaa
[3:39:44] <%SirGO0SE> pls dont tempt crazy talk
[3:39:59] <InugamiTheHound> @arcaderabbit48 yeah I know that, both 10 and 13 are the same linear but one everyone loved and other hated even though they didn't do anything different when it comes to map
[3:40:01] <Valdorick> I want an overworld on the remake... but I don't think it'll happen.
[3:40:02] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you're getting drowned out
[3:40:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> turn the music a smidge
[3:40:03] <%wsintai> But what about the ZAPPING SYSTEM tho
[3:40:08] <%arkv01> @doug_famous its hard to make a case for world maps these days but they are catering to the nostalgia crowd, 50/50
[3:40:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> down*
[3:40:11] <%arcaderabbit48> There's a ton fo stuff to expand on in Midgar, so I really don't think the padding is strictly a negative
[3:40:13] <Ion_Laser> turn the music down a little bit
[3:40:15] <%QueequegTheater> Just go turn based or real time, ATB is muddled in-between bullshit
[3:40:16] <AMUSERNAME> GOOD
[3:40:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo
[3:40:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> you are

[3:40:21] <%Faustgesicht> yeah
[3:40:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, it really is
[3:40:23] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it kinda picked up a bit, ya
[3:40:24] <%terminallyCapriciousz> very loud
[3:40:24] <%starotter70> Bit loud
[3:40:26] <reonome> make it louder
[3:40:28] <JoeNeutrino> No. The volume is fine
[3:40:29] <%QueequegTheater> BETTER
[3:40:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> slightly lower and it will be perfect
[3:40:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> game noise big loud
[3:40:32] <peanutandbuttershow> Have a great day Pat!!!
[3:40:33] <%QueequegTheater> MAWP

[3:40:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> wah wah
[3:40:57] <smugjorgen> too low
[3:40:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> perfect
[3:40:59] <%terminallyCapriciousz> much better
[3:41:01] <%Keyd00d> this theme goes on a while too
[3:41:02] <%ColonelRozum> much better
[3:41:03] <Ion_Laser> better
[3:41:04] <%starotter70> Fine
[3:41:05] <%king_wragles> VoteYea
[3:41:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> if we can't hear him, he can't leave
[3:41:07] <peanutandbuttershow> I love FF7!!!!
[3:41:08] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Hey, tell Paige I got her Twitter message but my account is currently suspended. It's no worries
[3:41:11] <+Intolerable> GOOD
[3:41:11] <+dickbuttboss> jaboodyGurt
[3:41:13] <darcfowler1995> the fact that the Remake is going to be multiparts is kind of ridiculous it just seems like a big cash grab really no reason for it
[3:41:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's literally much better, now it's background music, PURFEKT
[3:41:24] <%CRAZYMOOSES77> CRAZYMOOSES77 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[3:41:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> LOL, chief irons
[3:41:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Chief Irons
[3:41:29] <%starotter70> LUL
[3:41:32] <peanutandbuttershow> You can do no wrong!!!
[3:41:32] <%Keyd00d> Chie Firons
[3:41:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> THE ultimate BIOlogical WEAPON
[3:41:47] <%SirGO0SE> based
[3:41:48] <Valdorick> Look, Don wants a classy hooker, not a slut.
[3:41:51] <blackorchidKI2> It's like people just up and forgot episodic JRPGs existed.
[3:41:55] <blackorchidKI2> I'm fine with it.
[3:41:55] <%QueequegTheater> I preferred the Hat in Time sub animation
[3:42:06] <%QueequegTheater> PROTECT YOURSELF FROM BIG BROTHER
[3:42:14] <Ion_Laser> Don prefers clad, not scantily clad
[3:42:20] <Valdorick> Ah yes, Episodic JRPGs... Fucking Xenosaga. Mostly Xenosaga 2.
[3:42:24] <%arcaderabbit48> FF7 is an absurdly big game. There's so much buried in here, and so many segments that people forget. Episodic makes a lot of sense
[3:42:25] <%Keyd00d> wow
[3:42:30] <peanutandbuttershow> Tell Paige, I love you both!!!
[3:42:31] <%doug_famous> We really are the ASS4DAYS
[3:42:31] <%starotter70> @blackorchidKI2 As someone who has played the Trails series, I can deal with the Remake
[3:42:38] <%QueequegTheater> There are also impending sub miscarriages
[3:42:40] <blackorchidKI2> @Valdorick dotHack was my introduction to that stuff.
[3:42:44] <%arkv01> @Valdorick 2 WutFace
[3:42:54] <+Ell1ot> i got to the end but never finished it because i wanted to get all the stuff before the final boxx
[3:42:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> @darcfowler1995 I dunno, the apparently 20-ish hours of gameplay part 1 is supposed to be seems like it's already gonna be a longer game than most AAA games already.
[3:43:00] <peanutandbuttershow> Shit drunk to much!!!
[3:43:02] <JoeNeutrino> FF7 isn't absurdly big. It's a pretty standard JRPG length.
[3:43:03] <Valdorick> Breed her with Dawg
[3:43:12] <peanutandbuttershow> Drink
[3:43:13] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Hey, tell Paige I got her Twitter message but my account is currently suspended. It's no worries
[3:43:25] <peanutandbuttershow> Drunk?
[3:43:28] <%Bane_Kaikyo> B I G E Y E
[3:43:29] <%QueequegTheater> Thanks
[3:43:29] <InugamiTheHound> I never got omni-slash or knights of round and golden chocobo
[3:43:30] <TeepPhoenix> The Meteor descends.
[3:43:34] <Valdorick> @blackorchidKI2 Oh shit, I forgot about dotHack… mostly because I never played the second one, or the third one!
[3:43:42] <peanutandbuttershow> Gopodnight everybody.
[3:43:43] <%Keyd00d> yes
[3:43:46] <%QueequegTheater> SWEET BOI
[3:43:48] <%starotter70> Ye
[3:43:50] <darcfowler1995> well if that's true that'll be cool I just hope it's not what I'm thinking and it actually turns out that it was for a good reason I just ran through the game on switch myself a couple of weeks ago it just seems weird to me
[3:43:51] <%starotter70> apatGib
[3:43:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can't really expect to make a game in the scope of FFVII as a single game anymore. It was already kind of two games anyway.
[3:43:55] <%Keyd00d> apatGib
[3:43:56] <JoeNeutrino> aww baby
[3:44:03] <blackorchidKI2> @Valdorick I only knew of G.U. thanks to my brother owning the (former) trilogy back in the day.
[3:44:05] <%QueequegTheater> Imma head over to Plague
[3:44:08] <%arkv01> he itty bitey
[3:44:15] <TeepPhoenix> What is Plague playing?
[3:44:21] <InugamiTheHound> ff 14
[3:44:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> FFXIV
[3:44:42] <%Tyonidus> umm what? lmao
[3:44:45] <%Owkono> it runs on souls
[3:44:48] <@lewdskeletor13> Just got back, stream ending or just a break?
[3:44:55] <+Ell1ot> how long is this part of the remake supposed to be?
[3:44:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> ending
[3:44:56] <%starotter70> *Sinister Music Starts Playing
[3:44:58] <Valdorick> Ending
[3:45:00] <InugamiTheHound> stream is over
[3:45:02] <%thelaxinator> 10?! holy shit
[3:45:02] <@lewdskeletor13> Thanks
[3:45:06] <%king_wragles> @lewdskeletor13 stream compltee
[3:45:11] <%Frost_Quill> If I ever streamed FFVII I'd purposefully miss Yuffie and Vincent just to fuck with people. It's probably good that I don't stream.
