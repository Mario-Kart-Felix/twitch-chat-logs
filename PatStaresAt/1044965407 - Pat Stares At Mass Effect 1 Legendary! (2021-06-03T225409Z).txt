[0:18:38] <+waltzqueen> I had a rottweiler who was a year old. Everyone said he was scary even though Potato was the sweetest idiot tht ever lived
[0:18:38] <DubyaOFS> My dogs do that to people too. They just love people and they’re afraid for various reasons
[0:18:39] <LailahQueenx> I get that way and I had a dog growing up
[0:18:39] <RGBgamesinc> gief put the big friendly vest on AS A TRICK
[0:18:40] <%Jumpie8> Jumpie8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey Pat just got my first shot today. Zaangief is a good boy and needs pets.
[0:18:40] <%TheYellowcouch> All it takes is one time being chased as a kid and suddenly every dog is terrifying
[0:18:41] <%Zeikier> "he's really nice" dog owners can go to hell
[0:18:43] <%W1nterTitan> "He's very dumb and friendly"

[0:19:03] <+fetrigon> Can't have people scarin your pets
[0:19:12] <jackelzxaa> You fix it by calling them a big fat stupid idiot
[0:19:18] <%Maids4lyfe> @42nfl19 that's because it was in Canada at least
[0:19:18] <Ipsenscastle> If I hadn't seen him be a big idiot many times, I would personally be scared of him biting my face off
[0:19:19] <xeros720> pugs must seem like weird aliens

[0:36:00] <missingangle> This is them pushing Cage under a bus and driving said bus
[0:36:01] <+GingerStrawhat> Is this a bigger shitshow then the Apple vs Epic thing or is it just better?
[0:36:02] <%TheWinged7> its a jab with SELF DAMAGE
[0:36:03] <%TheYellowcouch> Easiest court defense in the history of law
[0:36:03] <Jane_Lo> @Rojahh you think he cares?
[0:36:05] <filialpails> we demand to be taken seriously
[0:36:05] <%JoshManVGH> The Defense lawer must be so confused to have a week off from work like this

[0:36:11] <teflonbilly777> David Cage put on trial for FAT EVIL
[0:36:11] <%DirtyGlasses23> Quantic Dream makes legal decisions the same way they make games: bad

[0:36:16] <jorniev> yeah DOC saying no one has worked with them again REALLY REALLY makes sense now

[0:36:42] <%Archphronimos> Aren't true narcissists fucking fascinating? So aggressive yet sooo fragile
[0:36:42] <thetunnelhomer> This 100% means that David Cage has seen the old playthroughs and probably cried about them.
[0:36:42] <%Pappajimbo> david cage tatics:pull the pin and then throw the pin keep the grenade

[0:41:45] <+VideoGoblin> Wow that's dumb
[0:41:48] <%BoxNavy> do they think that asian people just naturally harvest the virus in them?

[0:41:50] <%Maids4lyfe> fuck racism

[0:41:53] <+AFellowDegen> @JoshManVGH he called Taiwan a country
[0:41:56] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking bullshit rhetoric spread by goddamn wackos.
[0:41:58] <%TheYellowcouch> it's almost like a certain important person faned the flames to this for no real reason
[0:41:58] <Sunstalker> There's those fucking douchebags assaulting elderly people
[0:41:59] <teflonbilly777> It really helped that the former president of the US was constantly blaming CHYNA and calling it the china virus even after being told not to
[0:42:01] <+RoByte2> It didn't help there was a "leader" going around calling it the China flu, and kung flu, etc
[0:42:06] <%Zeikier> how dare they be responsible
[0:42:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Credit to that mayor
[0:42:06] <T_Sasquatch> and other people !

[0:42:48] <%toolofparanoia> Asia smart, Murican dumb
[0:42:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> If we had like 2 weeks of masking and social distancing every year, we could break the flu forever
[0:42:49] <+SlagChambers> I will say though, thank you Pat for giving me a way to numb the pain/anxiety caused by coming to realization that my country is seeping into Fascism
[0:42:49] <%Maids4lyfe> I love masks, government can't see my fucking face
[0:42:50] <%TheJubbernaut> thats just because everyone had covid, the flu didnt exist this year
[0:42:53] <%zacyzacy> same
[0:42:54] <%dankjerri> the air is chunky
[0:42:54] <%bhp_99> same
[0:42:54] <%JamesCorck> You can't trust people Pat!
[0:42:54] <tintedpalette> Too bad masks have been denoted with freedom so people aren’t going to do it in the USA which is dumb
[0:42:55] <%BoxNavy> they gotta make mask 2. the mask that doesnt fog up your glasses
[0:42:55] <%Zeikier> "bUt vOuS mUsT eNjOy MoI jErMs!"
[0:42:57] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Wales had only 30 cases of flu this year
[0:42:57] <%skeleklng> If there's one good thing coming out of the pandemic is that people are finally fucking washing their hands properly
[0:42:59] <%FacetiousAF> i went to WALMART
[0:43:00] <%JamesCorck> Don't trust anyone!

[0:43:09] <%Rumbutt> shaking hands is DEAD I am never doing that againt
[0:43:09] <Aydarkzero> mask mandate is kind of done where i am but everyone is still wearing one anyway'

[0:43:13] <digaogrunge> MASKS ARE COOL
[0:43:13] <Gorshum> I'm vaccinated but I like wearing a mask just because it makes people down here mad.
[0:43:15] <%zacyzacy> especially if I ever go on a plane again it would just make that better
[0:43:15] <%TheYellowcouch> I haven't been as free from sickness as I have been this past year
[0:43:16] <%DirtyGlasses23> THE BEST PART is now the crazy anti-maskers ARE wearing masks SO THEY DON'T /CATCH SIDE EFFECTS/ FROM VACCINATED PEOPLE
[0:43:18] <ValkahRoctsteel> Haven’t had a cold/flu in over a year.
[0:43:19] <%TheYellowcouch> it's awesome
[0:43:20] <DubyaOFS> I didn’t get sick last year!
[0:43:20] <T_Sasquatch> Mask ownership is a human right
[0:43:21] <%JamesCorck> Don't trust anyone, regardless of anything, people are gross!
[0:43:21] <%peanutdot007> Yeah until they've really tamped down overall spread masks are a good second line even with a vaccine
[0:43:21] <+FierceDeityGabe> Hide the ugly

[0:43:23] <%TheJubbernaut> thats fine but dont talk down to people who dont wear them mask
[0:43:25] <peachy996> I'm keeping my masks. Hiding my face is actually nice
[0:43:25] <%Jumpie8> I don't want to take my mask off
[0:43:26] <Solvari> yeah I don't understand the problems people have with putting a mask on for a minute

[0:47:27] <%Spydurman> luh luh
[0:47:27] <deviljhojho_> hey man if it works it works

[0:47:36] <AmericanaRed> cage: TOUCH GRASSE
[0:47:36] <Sunstalker> ethan, give me your phantom nut
[0:47:37] <thesugardaddy111> what was the worst David cage game in your opinion?
[0:47:38] <%TheYellowcouch> what a thespian
[0:47:41] <%DirtyGlasses23> I LOVE the one where Ethan just fucking offs himself in front of Madison
[0:47:43] <deviljhojho_> i wish it was made up
[0:47:45] <%DaKnightWarrior> OSFrog
[0:47:46] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Did you heard about the crazy at the david cage lawsuit
[0:47:48] <T_Sasquatch> @BigCoffee oh yes ! i finished an entire series doing that. Also if youre going to l
[0:47:48] <%bugz_munny> beyond
[0:47:48] <ergulor> wait there is a video?
[0:47:51] <ergulor> and omikron?
[0:47:52] <%Spydurman> Omikron
[0:47:52] <%DirtyGlasses23> WHAT
[0:47:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> SLAM ME TILL I'M PREGGERS ON YOUR CHILD'S GRAVE ETHAN
[0:47:54] <%JamesCorck> I can't deny it.
[0:47:56] <%TheWinged7> Omicron?
[0:47:56] <Grandnatics> Not Omikron??
[0:47:57] <Mothraken> THERES A VIDEO
[0:47:57] <iosephe> Omikron?
[0:47:58] <missingangle> "My son is dead I am so sad." "Ethan put baby in meeee."
[0:47:58] <+GingerStrawhat> Even more the Omikron
[0:47:58] <DatAsuna> I still say fahrenheit
[0:47:59] <+SargentToughie> Beyond worse than Omikron?
[0:48:00] <HieloMcFly> Ethan gets mad, cries, and stomps out of the room
[0:48:00] <%DirtyGlasses23> Are we not counting Omikron?
[0:48:00] <%Monkeyweed21> OMIKRON
[0:48:01] <teflonbilly777> Omikron is worse mechanically
[0:48:01] <%dankjerri> OMIKRON
[0:48:01] <%JamesCorck> Indigo Prophecy?
[0:48:02] <%DianaTheAscian> the full version is even worse
[0:48:02] <bob900000> what's the best
[0:48:02] <%Zeikier> yeah Beyond is pretty awful
[0:48:02] <T_Sasquatch> @BigCoffee level up all crafters nd gathers or dont bother
[0:48:03] <bluetooth39> psa1guy
[0:48:04] <Aydarkzero> that one has questionable moments
[0:48:04] <deviljhojho_> best is detroit me am hooman, not that thats saying much
[0:48:05] <+GingerStrawhat> Cause Omikron is at least more interesting
[0:48:05] <joapple_> omikron is worse
[0:48:05] <%bugz_munny> but Beyond is PLOT BAD
[0:48:07] <%FacetiousAF> omikron IS that bad
[0:48:07] <%Jumpie8> Omikrom is worst
[0:48:07] <Solvari> Omicron my man
[0:48:08] <%slimmixrp> Omikron.
[0:48:08] <AmericanaRed> OMIKRON TOP 1
[0:48:09] <%BoxNavy> omikron KILLED woolie
[0:48:09] <%TheWinged7> LUL that was repressed
[0:48:09] <DatAsuna> remember the indigo child?
[0:48:10] <Explodincatz> YOU FORGOT
[0:48:10] <%JamesCorck> I thought Indigo Prophecy was way worse.
[0:48:10] <%transporterthesequel> Nah the Ellen Page abuse beats out Omikron
[0:48:10] <%Zeikier> Omikron don't count cuz it's their first game innit?
[0:48:10] <%TheYellowcouch> Yeah omikron is unplayable but beyond is fucking insulting
[0:48:11] <+flexin_apex> Still can’t believe it
[0:48:11] <missingangle> No it's SUPER TRUE
[0:48:13] <%maenos2> I mean omikron has bowie at least
[0:48:13] <bijushu> LUL
[0:48:13] <%Spydurman> at least B2S is easy to play
[0:48:13] <+VideoGoblin> WELCOME IN OMICRON
[0:48:13] <%BigCoffee> @T_Sasquatch it's slot as a lvl 50 botanist so far
[0:48:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ALWAYS OMIKRON
[0:48:16] <Profmcstevie> Omikron bad game, Beyond bad game AND creepy
[0:48:17] <+bassoontyphoon> Not omikron??
[0:48:17] <Solvari> Fahrenheit was ok for the first half
[0:48:17] <viewtifulr> I mean interms of gameplay or writing?
[0:48:17] <%templar010> Omikron is a fucking war crime
[0:48:17] <Frozilla15> Omikron is mechanically worse
[0:48:17] <%AbnormalVoid> Beyond is  stupider, but Omikron is terrible
[0:48:17] <%Ranryu692> Beyond Two Souls at least runs pretty well
[0:48:17] <%Tman451> Indigo Prophecy falls apart pretty hard
[0:48:18] <%JoshManVGH> Omicron is bad mechanically Two.Souls seems like a writing crime.
[0:48:18] <%Agami23> beyond two souls is the worst game, omikron isnt a game
[0:48:18] <DatAsuna> Or the aliens that killed the dinosaurs?
[0:48:19] <%DirtyGlasses23> Beyond Two Souls at least has controls, that's more than anyone can say about Omikron
[0:48:20] <RetributionP> do you have more fun having a bad time?
[0:48:20] <Basch71> Omikron is bad but B2S is way up its own ass
[0:48:20] <%peanutdot007> @PatStaresAt The fact this is a question says something really
[0:48:20] <%Maids4lyfe> TIES CAN EXIST
[0:48:21] <set29> Omikron is at least fun to watch someone else play
[0:48:23] <%NateyBeak> my favorite part of omikron is when you kill two innocent people to open a door you could have asked help on
[0:48:23] <%ironohki> The Beyond Two Souls LP got me back into SBF after I fell off from the old old stuff.
[0:48:24] <tranquilturnip> Omikron is at least interesting
[0:48:24] <AmericanaRed> OMIKRON REMAKE
[0:48:25] <Ipsenscastle> Nothing Cage makes really communicates any meaning that he intended anyway, the dude wouldn't know how to deliver a theme if he had a map
[0:48:25] <digaogrunge> ITS ALL BAD MY DUDE
[0:48:26] <+evbites> @PatStaresAtwhat about indigo?
[0:48:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:48:27] <%GinAndRoses> omigron not good
[0:48:28] <Dfreddy8> Yeah but Omikron is and older game.
[0:48:29] <%craigb31> omikron might be my favorite LP you guys did
[0:48:29] <+DeadlyPeaks> The game of real life
[0:48:30] <Sp3ctre48> I don't think Omikron can count, it barely qualifies as a game
[0:48:30] <%Kurgash> Kurgash subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Thanks for all the great content and helping me unwind after long stressful days at the office.
[0:48:33] <Grandnatics> Power gap for Detroit?
[0:48:33] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt you guys almost killed each other in that lp
[0:48:34] <%shurtal> PAT FORGOT ABOUT OMIKRON
[0:48:34] <%blastazoid00> Omikron was PAIN
[0:48:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Detroit
[0:48:35] <doggieo> Gameplay VS Graphics
[0:48:35] <%Ranryu692> Indigo Prophecy is my favorite because it's the most absurd lol
[0:48:35] <AmericanaRed> sbfpKoopy
[0:48:36] <deviljhojho_> oh god its all bad
[0:48:36] <thetunnelhomer> Omicron is Trash, but Beyond is expensive trash
[0:48:36] <%DirtyGlasses23> omigron
[0:48:37] <%AllenDeadman> didn't beyond 2 souls use the girl's naked model without her permission or something?
[0:48:39] <%BigCoffee> Wait is Indigo actually good?
[0:48:40] <%ospreyworks> Did Paige play all of the David Cage games?
[0:48:40] <tranquilturnip> Pat you and the gang gave Omikron value by suffering through it
[0:48:40] <%toolofparanoia> I WANNA PUNCH DAVID CAGE IN THE THROAT FOR HIS FUCKIN SCUMBAGNESS
[0:48:41] <%bugz_munny> its so weird Detroit was kinda good
[0:48:41] <+bassoontyphoon> Beyond two souls is playable and is at least short
[0:48:41] <%dankjerri> detroit is really the best?
[0:48:42] <$BoBoGaijin> octoLurk
[0:48:43] <peachy996> they all suck
[0:48:45] <%ironohki> It's good until you think about it.
[0:48:46] <T_Sasquatch> honestly i prefer heavy rain. detroit is only good for connor
[0:48:46] <+CursedNobleman> two souls is that much worse than indigo?
[0:48:47] <aiutare47> FAHRENHEIT COULD'VE BEEN GOOD
[0:48:47] <teflonbilly777> A third of Detroit is great
[0:48:47] <marvel877> OMIKRON is barely playable, Beyond at least functions.
[0:48:49] <Sunstalker> Omikron is bad mechanically, beyond 2 souls is awful story and detroit is terrible metaphors
[0:48:49] <+evbites> kara is irrelevent
[0:48:50] <missingangle> Detroit's great in some places and TERRIBLE in most others
[0:48:51] <%GinAndRoses> so you're saying they're trending upwards
[0:48:52] <Broken_Sonex> NEVER FORGET OMIKRON
[0:48:54] <Ipsenscastle> Detroit was almost kinda good
[0:48:54] <%peanutdot007> Detroit is all the tools to make a good game used by an idiot
[0:48:54] <%Zeikier> yeah yeah
[0:48:54] <%DirtyGlasses23> Detroit and Heavy Rain are SO CLOSE to actually being good
[0:48:55] <%Monkeyweed21> its so close to being great
[0:48:56] <%JamesCorck> Augh.
[0:48:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its a decent game
[0:48:57] <SpellCatty> Detroit has Connor and Mr Krabs
[0:48:59] <%transporterthesequel> Infinite money spent on a bad screenplay
[0:49:00] <%JamesCorck> Pat you're so right.
[0:49:01] <Grandnatics> 2/3 of Detroit was good
[0:49:01] <+GingerStrawhat> Theres so much Talent on display surrounded by the shittiest writing
[0:49:02] <deviljhojho_> detroit gets hard carried by the characters in a couple of routes
[0:49:05] <%TheYellowcouch> If detroit was made by literally anyone else it would be a fine game
[0:49:06] <%Zeikier> especially cuz Connor and Hank's actors were pissing Cage off by being good actors
[0:49:06] <deviljhojho_> just remove kara
[0:49:06] <%JamesCorck> Detroit could've been excellent.
[0:49:07] <missingangle> Literally just gimme a game with Connor and Hank and it'd be top tier
[0:49:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> The best parts of Detroit isn't even die to Cage it's the actors changing things to make it good
[0:49:08] <friedsquidiot> I loved the tech demo it spawned from
[0:49:09] <no123450n> just like the city
[0:49:10] <+flexin_apex> Yea
[0:49:10] <%RetroCop87> I just had poutine with onion rings instead of fries, and now I'm desperately brushing my teeth to get rid of the taste
[0:49:11] <T_Sasquatch> if you remove connor, detroit would be trash
[0:49:11] <AmericanaRed> cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh
[0:49:11] <Dunmarkh> Remove kara
[0:49:12] <Sunstalker> Detroit is just where the really got the money for good actors and animations
[0:49:13] <teflonbilly777> Connor and Clancy Brown are fantastic
[0:49:13] <DatAsuna> "I can fix him" the game
[0:49:15] <%FacetiousAF> you only need 1/3 of Detroit, really
[0:49:16] <%JamesCorck> But it's tied to the David Cage dick.
[0:49:16] <%DaKnightWarrior> Yep
[0:49:17] <%JoshManVGH> All of Clancy Browns stuff yeah
[0:49:17] <%skeleklng> The parts with Connor is genuinely borderline genius
[0:49:17] <%jillpilled> Robit and Mr. Krabs carry that game
[0:49:17] <Aydarkzero> Connor and Mr Krabs carry that game HARD
[0:49:19] <Grandnatics> What part of Detroit would you cut out?
[0:49:19] <$Faustgesicht> How much of Detroit BH isn't David Cage's writing?
[0:49:19] <marvel877> DETROIT works in certain places because the actors adlibbed the best parts.
[0:49:19] <bluetooth39> heavy rain > detroit
[0:49:20] <peachy996> I hate Mass Effect 3 plot but I''ll play it any time over the Cage "games"
[0:49:21] <%JamesCorck> So it can't be good.
[0:49:21] <tranquilturnip> There is a good thread in there somewhere
[0:49:21] <Ipsenscastle> Just the Connor bits, that would be rad
[0:49:25] <thesugardaddy111> seriously, they grasped defeat from the jaws of victory imo
[0:49:26] <%bugz_munny> agree
[0:49:27] <%dankjerri> how did Detroit win GOTY awards
[0:49:27] <%BoxNavy> yeeeeah
[0:49:28] <Aydarkzero> Kara was pointless!
[0:49:29] <stantheman_97> Detroit is almost good until the last fourth
[0:49:31] <deviljhojho_> Absolutely, just completely eradicate it
[0:49:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DELET KARA
[0:49:32] <%Agami23> yeah
[0:49:33] <missingangle> 100% yes
[0:49:33] <%toolofparanoia> OOF
[0:49:34] <%DianaTheAscian> just leave Conner in
[0:49:35] <Solvari> Connor carried hard
[0:49:35] <%bugz_munny> just Connor and the rev guy
[0:49:36] <%Ranryu692> step one is acknowledge that it's a metaphor for civil rights lol
[0:49:36] <FortuneEX> yup
[0:49:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> I usually let her die on replays
[0:49:37] <Browncoat_Alex> detroit should have just been android LA Noire with Hank and Connor investigating cyber crimes, make the android rights stuff subtext
[0:49:37] <%DirtyGlasses23> Or at the VERY LEAST take out the twist
[0:49:38] <no123450n> but the evil fat
[0:49:39] <Ipsenscastle> and then remove Marcus' sections
[0:49:40] <%kewlmyc> Fat Evil though
[0:49:40] <missingangle> She has no momentum in the story
[0:49:42] <%ospreyworks> Just save the buddy cop segment
[0:49:44] <teflonbilly777> Just make it a Connor game
[0:49:44] <%Zeikier> pretty much yeah
[0:49:44] <peachy996> but pat you remove the tits!!
[0:49:45] <Broken_Sonex> DELET KARA
[0:49:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OR REMOVE THE TWIST
[0:49:46] <%snow_bush> I mean, real detroit is basically Fortnight
[0:49:46] <%RetroCop87> I'd say Marcus's section holds up
[0:49:47] <%Varlinator> Ctrl Alt Delete Kara
[0:49:49] <missingangle> well minus the racist stuff.
[0:49:49] <%ospreyworks> also remove Marcus
[0:49:51] <Grandnatics> WHAT ABOUT THE BUS
[0:49:52] <$Sdeje> Kara was there because she was a tech demo
[0:49:52] <%Monkeyweed21> BUT WE NEED THE HUGE BLACK SLAVE ROBOT TO SING THE SONG
[0:49:52] <%Zeikier> Marcus almost had good sections but then they fucked it up
[0:49:53] <peachy996> David Cage NEEDS THE TITS
[0:49:53] <%bugz_munny> oh god that twist too
[0:49:54] <%aBlueWizard> you mean the talking Rhumba?
[0:49:54] <+ralph4044> I've not finished it but WHAT
[0:49:56] <thesugardaddy111> but, the fat evil tho
[0:49:57] <$BoBoGaijin> Lol
[0:49:57] <%JoshManVGH> Well... there is Marcus freedom speech.

[0:50:14] <%Jumpie8> I was so pissed after David Bowie died and David Cage decided to shell his fucking game
[0:50:14] <deviljhojho_> COMPLETELY
[0:50:14] <%JoshManVGH> Keep Clancy Brown!
[0:50:14] <+GingerStrawhat> I actually like Kara's section more the Marcus
[0:50:16] <%illtima> They fuck
[0:50:16] <HieloMcFly> I was always more interested in connors and hanks story
[0:50:16] <iosephe> ENTIRE GAME
[0:50:16] <%Agami23> i want markus to be able to triple down on murder.
[0:50:18] <deviljhojho_> Oh

[0:50:19] <Solvari> BROMANCE DLC
[0:50:19] <fritz_dacat> even the painting bit
[0:50:20] <teflonbilly777> Add some FAT EVIL for Connor and Hank to fight
[0:50:20] <missingangle> You're on the money!!!
[0:50:20] <thesugardaddy111> so literally, get rid of 2/3rds of the game?!?!?!
[0:50:20] <marvel877> Connor is SO much more fleshed out than Kara and Marcus that they feel like after thoughts.
[0:50:21] <%walternatorz> connor hank deviant hunting parties
[0:50:21] <%dankjerri> conners section, completely gone
[0:50:22] <Ipsenscastle> make them kiss
[0:50:23] <Grandnatics> is that a different game at that point or not?
[0:50:23] <%DaKnightWarrior> YEYEYEYE
[0:50:24] <%toolofparanoia> I AGREE
[0:50:24] <SpellCatty> Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song is basically is Detroit didn't suck, in like, anime form. Starring Hatsune Miku. They even have the radtacular walking corpse garbage dump bit
[0:50:24] <+GingerStrawhat> Exactly
[0:50:25] <+SinnerEbru> connor + hank = kiss
[0:50:26] <SaltyAzteca> Conner and Hank were pretty fun
[0:50:26] <FortuneEX> You love to see it
[0:50:26] <%jillpilled> LET CONNOR KISS HANK
[0:50:26] <AmericanaRed> ALL GAME
[0:50:27] <%TheYellowcouch> and remove the big war at the end
[0:50:28] <+GingerStrawhat> And the dialogue
[0:50:28] <%Varlinator> WHOLE GAME
[0:50:28] <tranquilturnip> Connor and Hank main game, Marcus NG+
[0:50:28] <marvel877> FUCK
[0:50:29] <%BoxNavy> hes done it
[0:50:30] <BerryliciousDefinition> His romance with North, was just so bad
[0:50:30] <+GingerStrawhat> and the action
[0:50:31] <%Zeikier> make a game of the AI making the game
[0:50:31] <T_Sasquatch> if it was just connor and jank that game would be a 9/10
[0:50:33] <%peanutdot007> Just a two hour segment at the end of the game where Connor literally just kills all humans
[0:50:34] <$BoBoGaijin> jiyuNice seems good
[0:50:34] <Broken_Sonex> MAKE THEM KISS
[0:50:35] <+StoopKid241> yup

[0:50:41] <Basch71> my robot buddy cop game
[0:50:42] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Connor is best character
[0:50:43] <+bassoontyphoon> Make them a couple
[0:50:43] <HieloMcFly> You did it
[0:50:43] <dan_g_v> but the robot slave powers
[0:50:44] <fritz_dacat> but running away with my child
[0:50:44] <%JoshManVGH> The best part of any David Cage game right there.
[0:50:46] <%twistedj3ster> YEAH
[0:50:47] <AmericanaRed> PAT EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
[0:50:49] <xeros720> thank you for reminding us connor and hank are written by completely different peopl
[0:50:52] <teflonbilly777> STOP WINKING BRIAN!
[0:50:54] <missingangle> Like Connor's so damn charming because Bryan Dechart is just cute af. Make him the main main character and you have an immediate improvement
[0:50:56] <%Zeikier> YES. YES
[0:50:57] <stantheman_97> markus would be good without the "DO EVIL" and "DO GOOD" characters
[0:50:58] <dan_g_v> we neee. robot enslaving other robots
[0:50:59] <FortuneEX> LUL
[0:50:59] <%shurtal> but what about the dump?  thats a pretty good sequence in Marcus section
[0:50:59] <Aydarkzero> oh dude that's the best
[0:51:00] <%Jumpie8> LUL
[0:51:00] <%BoxNavy> TANTRUMS
[0:51:01] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Yeah cage is a mega cock
[0:51:02] <%RetroCop87> and Cage getting pissed about that
[0:51:05] <%DakotaMacDoodle> It was clearly the section where Cage had the least control of.
[0:51:09] <+GingerStrawhat> Looking more and more real by the day
[0:51:10] <ape_hawk> "no you are ruining my art by being better than meeeeeeeee!"
[0:51:12] <Aydarkzero> like get dunked on idiot we'll have fun
[0:51:13] <horse_disguised_as_horse> The royal king of cocks
[0:51:14] <friedsquidiot> :o
[0:51:14] <%JamesCorck> "I like dogs. What's your dog's name?"
[0:51:15] <+StoopKid241> That sounds incredible
[0:51:15] <%TheYellowcouch> Brian dragged that game into goodnes
[0:51:18] <%dankjerri> Cage is an Wattpad author
[0:51:18] <%Zeikier> Bryan and Clancy are fucking immaculate
[0:51:19] <missingangle> That single wink Connor gives is better than Kara's entire damn story
[0:51:20] <%DirtyGlasses23> WAIT BUT PAT IF YOU GET RID OF MARCUS'S STORY YOU WON'T GET "PRESS X TO SADNESS"
[0:51:23] <%ospreyworks> the only part of Marcus' game that was any good was his climb out of hell/the junkyard
[0:51:23] <Sunstalker> It's so good but it doesn't beat Wesley Snipes CGI eyes
[0:51:25] <%Varlinator> I love that they did that so much
[0:51:26] <peachy996> It's also bizarre because someone went over Cage to keep it in
[0:51:27] <Browncoat_Alex> also Bryan dechart is hot af
[0:51:27] <HieloMcFly> The Smile that connors does
[0:51:29] <%TheYellowcouch> his back must have been so sore afterwards
[0:51:34] <teflonbilly777> Also Clancy Brown is one of the greatest That Guy actors. Rewatched Highlander not that long ago and The Kurrgan is still menacing
[0:51:35] <Apolar_> Ze bad game
[0:51:39] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Does this have a video of this?
[0:51:40] <AmericanaRed> JAMES CAMERON or DAVID CAGE sbfpShido
[0:51:43] <Grandnatics> But if you lose Marcus you lose TERMINATOR CONNOR
[0:51:44] <%peanutdot007> LA Noire but with robots would be cool
[0:51:46] <stantheman_97> i wonder what he thinks of those parts being the most well-received
[0:51:51] <arkv01> connor/hank is a great bromance
[0:51:55] <peachy996> "DO NOT WINK, I MAKE ZE BAD GAME, NOT GOOD!"
[0:51:57] <Ipsenscastle> for real
[0:51:57] <%JoshManVGH> And then you have to escape fat evil... again
[0:51:59] <%Zeikier> OH BOY TIME FOR SPAGHETTI AND LIE-BALLS
[0:52:00] <%BoxNavy> haha
[0:52:00] <%Varlinator> #RELEASETHECONNORCUT
[0:52:00] <teflonbilly777> When Connor says "I was scared..." I felt that
[0:52:02] <Profmcstevie> Wind out of my sails
[0:52:02] <%TheYellowcouch> oh totally
[0:52:03] <Aydarkzero> but the emotions!
[0:52:04] <$BoBoGaijin> Lol
[0:52:06] <+AFellowDegen> threw more tantrums i bet
[0:52:06] <%walternatorz> *wink*
[0:52:07] <%Monkeyweed21> TIME FOR THE MONSTER MANSION
[0:52:08] <%skeleklng> @PatStaresAt when I played Detroit I immediately killed the other two characters ASAP and only played Connor
[0:52:09] <Psyramics> most games have peaks and troughs, Detroit has plateaus and flatline
[0:52:09] <Aydarkzero> 28 stab wounds!
[0:52:10] <missingangle> BUT in order to get the best ending with Connor and Hank you gotta slog trhough the other stories and get those best endings, too :/
[0:52:10] <thesugardaddy111> I want a big fan of Detroit become human from the premise alone, robots. are. not. capable. of. emotions!!!!!!!
[0:52:14] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Until royal cock cage shits all over it
[0:52:15] <%spitelite> kara could have been really good if alice hadn't been a robot
[0:52:16] <$BoBoGaijin> oh riiight the David Cage thing
[0:52:17] <%Agami23> i can genuinely imagine david cage screaming like a petulant child "STOP FOCUSING ON NOT MEEEEEEE"
[0:52:19] <HieloMcFly> Your a god gamer
[0:52:20] <Profmcstevie> He probably weeps over a baguette
[0:52:23] <Apolar_> I showed up here to see if Pat was talking shit about David Cage and I'm not disappointed
[0:52:25] <%Jumpie8> he needs glasses because his vison sucks
[0:52:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Vision these nuts David
[0:52:27] <BerryliciousDefinition> Probably yelled some more slurs
[0:52:29] <friedsquidiot> You’re making me want to play just that part of the game
[0:52:30] <%toolofparanoia> DAVID CAGE MAKEA DA BAD GAME
[0:52:33] <arkv01> imagine my surprise when I'm binging DS9 and hanks actor shows up LUL
[0:52:34] <%BoxNavy> @Zeikier im cracking up over here cus of "lie-balls"
[0:52:35] <+london_flexing> So a critic then
[0:52:40] <%bugz_munny> transformative vs narcassistic
[0:52:42] <AmericanaRed> DETROIT CAGE CUT sbfpSetIn
[0:52:51] <%JoshManVGH> @skeleklng Can you still get the good Hank and Conner ending that way?
[0:52:52] <horse_disguised_as_horse> David Cage was a cock now he's a royal cock
[0:53:04] <%twistedj3ster> ehhhh
[0:53:06] <%toolofparanoia> CUT THE CAGE OUT OF DETROIT
[0:53:11] <xeros720> good old fashioned classic schlock
[0:53:12] <%JamesCorck> and Classic Schlock!
[0:53:15] <%TheYellowcouch> classic shlock
[0:53:20] <Aydarkzero> my vision!
[0:53:20] <thesugardaddy111> Detroit was stupid because robots aren't capable of half the stuff that happened in the game
[0:53:27] <SaltyAzteca> C3PO LUL
[0:53:31] <AmericanaRed> NO PURPLE LIGHTSABER sbfpWipeouts
[0:53:32] <+ZoltanBMagnus> James Cameron, too
[0:53:32] <%BigCoffee> wait Lucas did that?
[0:53:37] <%toolofparanoia> yeah
[0:53:38] <%Agami23> anyone who defends george lucas, strange magic.
[0:53:41] <iosephe> "I hate sand" is very important
[0:53:48] <%RetroCop87> psaDogchamp
[0:53:51] <Browncoat_Alex> thats not how lucas directs, lucas just said "faster, more intense"
[0:53:56] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib big coffees
[0:53:58] <corncob333> Niel Breen for new head of Quantic Dream
[0:53:58] <thesugardaddy111> why does paige like strange magic so much?
[0:53:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> goose_attack_almanac subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! Sumo is a good dog though.
[0:54:01] <HieloMcFly> David cries and stomps out of the office
[0:54:02] <%ospreyworks> Stanley Kubrick notoriously treated Shelley Duvall like shit.
[0:54:05] <teflonbilly777> @BigCoffee Lucas told Hayden Christiansen to do Anakin less human
[0:54:05] <%AllenDeadman> I hate sand
[0:54:09] <deviljhojho_> no crikSmile
[0:54:11] <%ssjklyco> "I hate sand. "
[0:54:15] <stantheman_97> it feels me with joy
[0:54:16] <ammobasket> Oh boy did he
[0:54:17] <%GarbageNirvana> You're my favorite customer. Hi doggy
[0:54:19] <%BigCoffee> iisisshhhhhhhh
[0:54:23] <%Varlinator> "Nooooo, zat iz not my genius writing"
[0:54:26] <no123450n> he sounds like david fincher, but without the talent
[0:54:28] <peachy996> Is that not what Jap directors do for RE voices
[0:54:28] <%JoshManVGH> Didn't it come out that Carrie Fischer was responsible for some of the best stuff in Empires Strikes Back?
[0:54:28] <%TheYellowcouch> yeah og trilogy was good just cause his wife told hime he was being dumb
[0:54:30] <bob900000> obi wan was the best
[0:54:30] <thetunnelhomer> To be fair, that did make some really funny memes.
[0:54:30] <%ospreyworks> Kubrick was a douchebag
[0:54:33] <%Zeikier> George wtf
[0:54:35] <%Rumbutt> SHAVE OFF THOSE SIDEBURNS
[0:54:36] <ape_hawk> so another creepy perv with too much power, got it
[0:54:37] <%BigCoffee> How do you fuck up having Natalie Portman
[0:54:40] <vonmaultke> god he's one of those
[0:54:41] <$lotharrio> Do it WORSE.
[0:54:41] <TourettesPlays> the chad auteur theory Pat
[0:54:42] <%peanutdot007> "No do it worse"
[0:54:45] <%JamesCorck> Faster and more intense.
[0:54:47] <thetunnelhomer> I'll gladly take prequel memes over a good movie
[0:54:49] <%MechArch> happier and with your mouth open
[0:54:54] <%dekkitout> LuvUok
[0:54:54] <%preeeow> its coarse and it gets everywhere
[0:54:57] <$BoBoGaijin> those damn space Italians jiyuTurnt
[0:54:57] <%JamesCorck> George Lucas would only give two directions: "Faster and more intense"
[0:54:58] <%Zeikier> the opposite end of that is the Coen Brothers, like all the stammers n shit in Big Lebowsky are all in the script
[0:54:58] <%AllenDeadman> yup
[0:55:00] <ammobasket> Lucas did all that greenscreen in eps 1 2 3 partly so that they could do a million takes
[0:55:02] <%UvBenServed> How embarrassing
[0:55:02] <%NopeBadguy> OF COURSE YOU KNOW. YOU. ARE. DOOMED.
[0:55:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, it is.
[0:55:04] <%bugz_munny> and then she kisses him
[0:55:04] <teflonbilly777> @corncob333 For all his fault, from that five hour how to make a movie documentary he did, Neil Breen seems like a good boss
[0:55:04] <%shurtal> I dieduh
[0:55:05] <%DaKnightWarrior> Ugh...
[0:55:07] <AmericanaRed> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:55:07] <Profmcstevie> Itsa in ma spaghetti
[0:55:09] <thesugardaddy111> Lucas is one of the main reasons that Hayden Christiansen was a terrible anakin
[0:55:10] <%BoxNavy> getsa
[0:55:10] <bijushu> yep
[0:55:11] <deviljhojho_> getsa
[0:55:16] <%AbnormalVoid> or like he's Paige
[0:55:16] <missingangle> Writing and direction really make an actor's performance more often than not. As a writer, the dialogue feels very crisp with Connor and Hank. You can tell they themselves got their hands into it.
[0:55:18] <James_Quivers> Sounds like Paige
[0:55:19] <%toolofparanoia> Lucas tried to kill Star Wars way before disney got it
[0:55:20] <+AnthonyJMax> cringe to the max
[0:55:20] <%TheYellowcouch> spitaly

[0:55:26] <thesugardaddy111> omg your right
[0:55:26] <Sunstalker> I COOKA DA SPACE PIZZA
[0:55:27] <T_Sasquatch> @varlinator to be fair .... He's the director.  There's a give and take to actors giving feedback.  You can't just have people doing random shit
[0:55:27] <%captainpodock> Apparently Michael Bay can be an insufferable dickhead on set but a sweetheart off the set and when someone asked home why its because on set everyone likes to gossip which can create friction between the different departments but if he's a dick to everyone it gives them a common enemy... I don't by it.
[0:55:27] <Gorshum> Why have you done this to me?
[0:55:28] <%BigCoffee> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, IT CANT BE TRUE
[0:55:28] <%dekkitout> Does that make Vader the Space Don?

[0:55:37] <Browncoat_Alex> pat looks like Watto lmao
[0:55:38] <+robert_edwards> @patstaresat Did Omikron or Cage in general have a role in the old channel ending, or am way off base?
[0:55:39] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT JEXTER DEXTER IN THAT DINNER
[0:55:42] <deviljhojho_> its real crikSuffer
[0:55:42] <Aydarkzero> oh god i just saw it
[0:55:44] <marvel877> Lucas wrote all of the prequels. The original trilogy he had other people writing alongside him and his then wife double checked his work.
[0:55:44] <Grandnatics> Isn't Kubrick WORSE?
[0:55:44] <soviet_spudtato> No pat please
[0:55:45] <%Scottigecko> BUT HE'S FREE
[0:55:45] <%BoxNavy> HE DOES
[0:55:45] <BerryliciousDefinition> HOLY SHIT THAT SUCKS
[0:55:45] <fritz_dacat> goo look at the prequils are you mad
[0:55:46] <thetunnelhomer> Okay okay, which is worse Lucas's cringe or souless mouse?
[0:55:46] <$Faustgesicht> because he was raised by WATTO, THE SCUMBAG
[0:55:46] <friedsquidiot> I heard that his wife had a big role in like editing the original trilogy and since they got divorced the she didn’t work on the prequel
[0:55:46] <Enajy314> LUL
[0:55:47] <Grandnatics> He'd make you take 50 takes
[0:55:47] <joapple_> im so glad i hate star wars
[0:55:48] <+polothegreatest> nah, itsa impossible
[0:55:50] <VigilantShield> Pat you made that moment worse for me somehow
[0:55:50] <+CursedNobleman> OH FUCK
[0:55:54] <%Monkeyweed21> I was like 6 when that movie came out and I knew it was TRASH
[0:55:55] <%peanutdot007> FUCK YOUR RIGHT
[0:55:55] <thesugardaddy111> oh yeah and then the 50s diner part
[0:55:55] <%JoshManVGH> Is talking about sand the one weird trick? I bet women do hate it.
[0:55:55] <%dekkitout> I now want the timeline where Marlon Brando voiced Vader
[0:55:56] <%dankjerri> more like CRONGE

[0:56:00] <$dalmek> I CAN'T UNHEAR IT NOW

[0:56:13] <HieloMcFly> Gets-a everywhere mrksHOW
[0:56:15] <FortuneEX> Oh god I just listened to it
[0:56:15] <$lotharrio> Kubrik berates actors and forces them to redo scenes until they have mental breakdowns.
[0:56:16] <%Zeikier> I'm gonna get gondolorrhea from this conversation
[0:56:18] <ManlyMcBeefington> darn it's real

[0:56:33] <%VigilantShield> VigilantShield subscribed with Prime. 
[0:56:33] <Sigma_190_Beta> I will argue to my deathbed however, it doesn't suck as much as the Sequels @PatStaresAt
[0:56:35] <peachy996> It's gonna be great x 4
[0:56:36] <%FacetiousAF> like movie goofs with cameras in mirrors and whatnot
[0:56:36] <digaogrunge> Speaking of space italians, a fan-cut of the Super Mario Brothers Movie came out, adds like 20 minutes of rough footage
[0:56:37] <xeros720> that sucksa so much
[0:56:37] <jorniev> MY FAVORITE IS WHEN PEOPLE BELIVE THE BAD WAS A JOKE
[0:56:38] <%Varlinator> @T_Sasquatch Dude... don't @ me and start defending David Cage. Pls, just don't.
[0:56:39] <$lotharrio> Lucas was still salty over Jar-Jar not being embraced.
[0:56:39] <+AFellowDegen> He got influenced by Jar-Jar as a kid. good writing
[0:56:40] <thesugardaddy111> anakin jumpman mario

[0:56:56] <missingangle> Man I'm glad I don't give two shits about Star wars, I can't imagine having to look at stuff like that and suffer.
[0:56:56] <%captainpodock> Can you imagine timid little George Lucas saying "Your going to say it Getsa everywhere or I'm going to break your legs "
[0:56:57] <HieloMcFly> Like David's tears, It Gets-a everyywhere
[0:56:58] <%Monkeyweed21> NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT OBITO'S GHOST GIVING KAKASHI A FLYING MECHA
[0:56:59] <%dankjerri> I think the words just might be too close together, pat.
[0:56:59] <%Maids4lyfe> SO DOES THAT MEAN GEORGE WANTED ANAKIN TO BE SPACE RACIST TO SPACE ITALIANS?
[0:57:00] <$BoBoGaijin> We need more Space Italian representation :)
[0:57:02] <thesugardaddy111> jar jar was honestly one of the worst parts of that movie
[0:57:03] <%bugz_munny> PADME doesnt getsa everywhere
[0:57:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I dont know theres A LOT OF BAD LINES
[0:57:04] <$lotharrio> Mesa hates sand. It muy muy coarse-a and rough-a and it getsa everywheres!
[0:57:04] <+polothegreatest> holy, itsa real.

[0:57:12] <%JoshManVGH> Yo mah pizzone getsa all gritty
[0:57:14] <ape_hawk> the shitty part is that these were all GREAT actors being given shitty scripts and a shittier director
[0:57:16] <jorniev> IT FEELS LIKE STAR WARS WAS DESTINED TO DIE
[0:57:16] <%Monkeyweed21> the fans AND the haters always forget the worst parts
[0:57:18] <%dekkitout> @Monkeyweed21 Because it's cool. 🙃
[0:57:19] <AmericanaRed> PURPLE LIGHTSABER THO sbfpWipeouts
[0:57:21] <$goregrinder138> yo homie, so love your content king ✌️
[0:57:23] <%ospreyworks> if you as a director have to treat your actors like shit to the point that they have panic attacks, you suck as a director
[0:57:28] <SaphronBlackbourne> I keep imagining Lucas Baker doing all this cuz I forgot George exists
[0:57:29] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:57:29] <ape_hawk> hi
[0:57:32] <ryman_official> I cooka da sandghetti ayyyyy
[0:57:41] <thesugardaddy111> eeyyy ya gettin sand in MA grinder
[0:57:41] <teflonbilly777> Poor Hayden Christiansen. His career never recovered. Dude can act
[0:57:42] <%DaKnightWarrior> Just looked it up. what have you done to me Pat NotLikeThis
[0:57:44] <%DJFakie> Zangief has 100% stun on all his moves
[0:57:45] <%dankjerri> oh fuck its monkeyweed

[0:58:02] <%bugz_munny> 100%
[0:58:03] <%dekkitout> Makes for good memes atleast
[0:58:04] <+YabbaTroll> I cant imagine anyone else though
[0:58:06] <pth88> Mace Windus part was written for Tupac
[0:58:08] <%dankjerri> the blackest most popular man at the time
[0:58:09] <thetunnelhomer> If they let Sam Jackson go full Sam Jackson it would have been great
[0:58:09] <$lotharrio> It's a complete waste of the actor.
[0:58:15] <seancbo> Pat, you dont understand. The accent is simply a reference to the great Italian Operas of old. Hayden Christensen is the Luciano Pavarotti of film
[0:58:18] <Broken_Sonex> We got some great memes out of it though
[0:58:18] <stantheman_97> they did the best with what they were given
[0:58:20] <%TheYellowcouch> but we did get Ewan McGregor and that was pog
[0:58:21] <RetributionP> a sith LOARD?
[0:58:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> USE THE FORCE MOTHERFUCKA
[0:58:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Lucas wasted Sam
[0:58:23] <digaogrunge> but purple
[0:58:23] <%BigCoffee> I dunno I kinda liked zen Sam Jackson....
[0:58:25] <%Meidolaon> Okay but Kingsman tho

[0:58:28] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt IDK, I feel like Sam as Mace gets a sort of quiet anger
[0:58:28] <peachy996> I feel like every Star Wars trilogy has only 1 actor whose career survives

[0:59:12] <%jillpilled> He comes back for 5 seconds too, fucking sham
[0:59:12] <%JoshManVGH> Watching the behind the scenes stuff, Haden is being told by George that the lines were rewritten last night, and Hayden looks like he just got told his day shift is now also a night shift, but he can't tell his boss to fuck off without losing his job.
[0:59:12] <thesugardaddy111> Morgan Freeman would have done better imo
[0:59:13] <T_Sasquatch> Keith david would do a treat maxe

[0:59:16] <jorniev> OH YEAH
[0:59:18] <DatAsuna> Remember how mace comes from a planet of only black people who live in the jungle?
[0:59:21] <+OzdotTV> Keith David would've been a good Mace
[0:59:24] <%GalacticaPhanto> He's godlike as an actor
[0:59:24] <%JamesCorck> hell at this point Eddie Murphy would've been a better Mace Windu.
[0:59:24] <+Freesidesu> casablanca
[0:59:26] <peachy996> Only Harrison Ford's career survived, Natalie Portman did the same and it's looking like Oscar Isaac will be the survivor here
[0:59:28] <fritz_dacat> But Sam has better star power
[0:59:28] <ChungusQuest> Yo imagine if they cast Michael Dorn for Mace
[0:59:29] <%ArCielArDor> THEY CALL ME MISTER TIBBS
[0:59:30] <teflonbilly777> Ewan had the cadence of Alec's speech pattern down
[0:59:30] <%dankjerri> KEITH DAVID THOUGH YEAH
[0:59:32] <%bugz_munny> Keith would have loved that roll
[0:59:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Denzel Washington would have fit waaaayyy better

[1:02:32] <%dekkitout> I could really go for a source on this please
[1:02:33] <+SLEEPATHALFMAST> FUCKING CUCKMAN BEING THE WORST
[1:02:33] <shadowstreakXIII> that soo badddddd oh god
[1:02:35] <JetpackMcQuack> oops
[1:02:35] <%valriot> Now we know why the reviews were good
[1:02:36] <skyentombment> WOOOOOWEEEEE
[1:02:36] <%DianaTheAscian> holy shit
[1:02:37] <thesugardaddy111> my brain is leaking out of the side of my head with this shit
[1:02:38] <slix3431> So the game is also Pro-genocide?
[1:02:39] <tintedpalette> Man no wonder the game journalists loved the game
[1:02:39] <%Teintstein> can we just have an apartheid state where ONLY zuckman is isolated from the rest of us?
[1:02:40] <%BigCoffee> This hurts more then omikron
[1:02:40] <+ThomasOfTroy> Neil Druckman pls go
[1:02:40] <%ArCielArDor> so fucking dumb
[1:02:42] <deviljhojho_> I dont think he is saying sike
[1:02:44] <moonmeh> wooooooow
[1:02:46] <%bugz_munny> PEOPLE BOUGHT IT TOO
[1:02:46] <horse_disguised_as_horse> What you're saying is the game is still shit
[1:02:47] <Broken_Sonex> [INDESCRIBABLE PAIN AND RAGE]
[1:02:48] <%TheYellowcouch> biy yikes
[1:02:49] <Dfreddy8> But Game of the Year though....
[1:02:50] <+BigBruthaThunda> turksTrashy
[1:02:50] <%DirtyGlasses23> That whole GAME was fucking stupid
[1:02:53] <%JamesCorck> That whole game is embarrassing.
[1:02:53] <Browncoat_Alex> its still good tho
[1:02:55] <%toolofparanoia> jesus fucking christ
[1:02:55] <%Daxalog> Is shindlers list a good movie never watched it?
[1:02:55] <+polothegreatest> oh sick, but reverse the roles
[1:02:55] <%DirtyGlasses23> The first one wasn't even good either
[1:02:55] <+Toshatron> wtf I love Abby now
[1:02:57] <ChaosedStar> so hes pro-israel?
[1:02:57] <$Futurecity10> did you see the druckman video by Chris Voiceman?
[1:02:58] <jackelzxaa> What a perversion
[1:02:58] <friedsquidiot> Hm???????
[1:03:01] <thetunnelhomer> @captainpodock It's pretty wild, I wanna live in that reality.
[1:03:03] <skyentombment> THAT'S SO FAR UP HIS OWN ASS
[1:03:03] <%Garthunox> so why do we then play as that character?
[1:03:04] <%captainpodock> He's full of shit
[1:03:05] <%JamesCorck> And miserable, and boring, and bad, and hypocritical as fuck!
[1:03:05] <Psyramics> don't compare your game to anything, let it stand on its own
[1:03:06] <Aydarkzero> I should see that movie
[1:03:08] <%Monkeyweed21> TLOU2 is going both sides are wrong
[1:03:09] <%mikeriffic> Just got here, what game and who is comparing themselves to schindlers list?
[1:03:10] <friedsquidiot> Wait what
[1:03:11] <$RealThiele> timeless social commentary
[1:03:12] <T_Sasquatch> @daxalog pain. It's pain
[1:03:13] <peachy996> When can I get a Game written by Druckman+Cage+Kojima.
[1:03:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> Never compare anything you made yourself as Schindler's List
[1:03:18] <%JoshManVGH> We had to watch it academically in high school.
[1:03:18] <thesugardaddy111> I dont understand, why? like at all?
[1:03:20] <%dekkitout> What's the Citizen Kane of games?
[1:03:23] <%Zeikier> your game about the mushroom people
[1:03:26] <marvel877> do not compare your work to some sort of atrocity.
[1:03:27] <%toolofparanoia> drukman endorses war crimes
[1:03:28] <teflonbilly777> @Daxalog It is amazing, but it's sad how making it broke Spielberg's sense of wonder
[1:03:28] <+evbites> also Shindler was a historical moive
[1:03:28] <olaksi> and the other is a throw away zombie plot
[1:03:32] <Profmcstevie> You can't sell a timeless classic upfront
[1:03:32] <RayCSmooth> Game of the Year Kappa
[1:03:32] <%Teintstein> even worse than that though
[1:03:34] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat nothing in TLOU2 comes ANYWHERE close to 'this pin, 2 people. I couldve got more.'
[1:03:37] <%Teintstein> the holocaust was REAL
[1:03:41] <Aydarkzero> he'd want to say it but knows he can't LUL
[1:03:42] <%TheYellowcouch> he would just put citizen kane IN his game
[1:03:42] <%transporterthesequel> he TOTALLY thinks it in his head
[1:03:42] <+GingerStrawhat> He loves movies too much to say that
[1:03:43] <%Zeikier> he's up his own ass but it's HIS ass that he's up
[1:03:44] <%dekkitout> Does he? Yeah... he does...
[1:03:47] <%Zeikier> not anyone else's
[1:03:47] <%bugz_munny> that big chungus mgs meme is the citizen kain of games
[1:03:48] <bob900000> that would be hilarious
[1:03:48] <%nikoloas_> that wasn't part of the marketing it was some reviewer
[1:03:50] <%Agami23> whats citizen cane?
[1:03:50] <ape_hawk> hell, kojima PREDICTED how covid would affect us and didnt say shit about it
[1:03:52] <%GarbageNirvana> The reason people say their games aren't political is because their politics are MASSIVELY FUCKED
[1:03:53] <%mikeriffic> What game is this?
[1:03:53] <%DEETRz> kojima is mad but not dumb
[1:03:54] <thetunnelhomer> Death Stranding is the "eat 70 pounds of raw vegetables in a single sitting" of games
[1:03:54] <thesugardaddy111> who wants to say "my game is the Schindlers list of games" !?!??@?@?@
[1:03:54] <seancbo> Death Stranding is the LotR of games because its just fuckin walking
[1:03:58] <jackelzxaa> Yoko Taro came out and said nier was the 9/11 of games
[1:04:00] <wolfen091> ooo suzi playing re0 sorry pat gotta go
[1:04:02] <marvel877> he probably does, but he's not going to say it.
[1:04:02] <T_Sasquatch> Schindler's list didn't hit me super hard until the actual survivors appeared at the end
[1:04:02] <pajamarammaslamma> Kojima did directly stated that DS was inspired by Trump and Brexit
[1:04:03] <%peanutdot007> Kojima 100% thinks that in his head which is in his ass
[1:04:05] <%DianaTheAscian> he does for sure
[1:04:06] <tanarath> Dr. Uckman knew better, though?
[1:04:08] <+Plus_On_Black> That's actually Mario 3
[1:04:09] <%The_Protagonist> BB was a sled.
[1:04:11] <+bassoontyphoon> Is citizen Kane the first strand type film
[1:04:11] <%SaiyanShoto> I can’t wait for Kojima movie
[1:04:12] <+Dova573> Maybe one day I can make a game thats the equivalent of The Room
[1:04:13] <+DeadlyPeaks> I’m cringing even more at the people that vehemently defend this game
[1:04:13] <thetunnelhomer> Oh right, Nier is 9/11
[1:04:15] <%TheYellowcouch> secret fart sniffer
[1:04:15] <%Mekhet09> If I had any respect for dunkman it'd be gone with that statement pat.
[1:04:17] <nivlac_555> his farts sniff good tho
[1:04:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok i just finished a lvl 50 dungeon with a tank that never used tank stance help im turning into THAT healer now
[1:04:18] <%JoshManVGH> At least he's not a huge asshole about it.
[1:04:19] <peachy996> Kojima will never be on the same level as fart sniffers like Druckman and Cage because there's still an inherent goofiness in his writing.
[1:04:19] <+GingerStrawhat> I think David Cage either dosn't know what art is or what it means, or doesn't care. He just knows that he wants to replicate it in someway
[1:04:20] <RetributionP> he pretty smart
[1:04:20] <+pacmanswang> Genius Kojumbo loves his own farts.
[1:04:21] <stantheman_97> he's pretentious as fuck but it's an enjoyable pretentiousness
[1:04:22] <%dankjerri> the 9/11 of games is TLOU2
[1:04:23] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Kojima probably has himself as his ringtone
[1:04:23] <$lotharrio> I mean, in Kojima's defense, he's pretty talented.
[1:04:25] <jorniev> LIKE its fine if you say: its like this made me feel like this and i want my game to feel like that too
[1:04:26] <%ArCielArDor> LUL LUL
[1:04:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT KOJUMBO
[1:04:29] <James_Quivers> He made a museum dedicated to his interactions with celebrities FFS
[1:04:31] <peachy996> Those two fucks are 100% serious in everything they do
[1:04:32] <%Agami23> the problem with kojima sniffing his own farts is that his farts make good neat games
[1:04:34] <tranquilturnip> A tier dog name
[1:04:38] <thewhiterice92> "Genius Kojumbo" said Kojima
[1:04:44] <%peanutdot007> Kojima has some pretty fine farts to be fair
[1:04:46] <FortuneEX> Sumo is such a good dog name
[1:04:47] <SaltyAzteca> Honda Kappa
[1:04:47] <Browncoat_Alex> important to note that druckmann said he felt gross and guilty for his feelings of anger and revenge after viewing the Israel video
[1:04:48] <%toolofparanoia> but Deathstranding was good. ot
[1:04:48] <%BigCoffee> Kojima sniffs his own farts but he also make-a da good-a game-a
[1:04:50] <thetunnelhomer> How does Nier work as a politcal thing, and not TLOU2? Is it writing quality?
[1:04:51] <tubit> I'm passing on both of those games as if they were highly polished turds on the sidewalk
[1:04:52] <jorniev> IS it pretensious when he keeps predicting the future by accident?
[1:04:52] <%Zeikier> I kinda wanna own a bulldog and name them "Abby," short for "abattoir"
[1:04:53] <+bassoontyphoon> Yeah
[1:04:55] <teflonbilly777> THE DOG IN FAR CRY 6 WILL MAKE ME BUY THE GAME!
[1:04:56] <yourliteraldog> Sic him sumo
[1:05:00] <skyentombment> Would you agree with the assessment that public figures should remove their internet footprint every year or so? as in, comments, tweets, etc?
[1:05:02] <thesugardaddy111> yeah but Kojima actually makes good games as a result
[1:05:03] <AmericanaRed> CHORIZO sbfpMember
[1:05:03] <%Zeikier> no wait! "Abattoir's Laughter"
[1:05:04] <%JoshManVGH> Oh I'm naming my next do Kojumbo, for sure
[1:05:06] <ChaosedStar> Thought Taro also stated that drakengard E is The bombings not 9/11?
[1:05:07] <Ipsenscastle> geniuses all love their own farts - but they're geniuses, they probably know something about their farts that we don't
[1:05:08] <peachy996> I bet you the humor David Cage has written for his games is still 100% serious
[1:05:11] <%jillpilled> @thetunnelhomer Pretty sure that was Drakengard 3, might be mistaken on that
[1:05:13] <RetributionP> Gator in farcry 6
[1:05:14] <%AFellowDegen> Jedi save
[1:05:15] <%toolofparanoia> I love sumo
[1:05:19] <%BigCoffee> @Zeikier I named my cat Abby for Abigail
[1:05:19] <%bugz_munny> wait
[1:05:20] <deviljhojho_> oh....
[1:05:21] <%bugz_munny> wut
[1:05:21] <skyentombment> not because they have an obligation, but as a prevention of disasters
[1:05:21] <nivlac_555> lmfao
[1:05:23] <%JoshManVGH> ...
[1:05:25] <bob900000> what?!
[1:05:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh fuck i forgot
[1:05:27] <deviljhojho_> please stop making stuff
[1:05:27] <jorniev> HIS POWERT LEVELS
[1:05:29] <+Chimeraelite> ?????
[1:05:29] <%Monkeyweed21> the ending of MGS5 is a massive allegory for Kojima is nothing special and any talented director could achieve similiar greatness if they were as lauded and supported as he was @PatStaresAt
[1:05:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[1:05:30] <$lotharrio> Huh?
[1:05:31] <%dankjerri> you mean Tatooine
[1:05:32] <%DianaTheAscian> ....
[1:05:33] <olaksi> Nier was never directly about 9/11
[1:05:34] <%BigCoffee> we have a new predator movei?!

[1:05:36] <+ThomasOfTroy> Autism is the NEXT STAGE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION
[1:05:36] <%Agami23> oh yeah
[1:05:37] <+MightyDuckShoes> Hey why didn't Padme buy Anakin's mom?
[1:05:37] <jackelzxaa> How weird is it that cage games stories get better the more characters you allow to die as early as possible?
[1:05:38] <%Maids4lyfe> what
[1:05:38] <%JoshManVGH> Is that the one with Topher Grace?
[1:05:38] <thetunnelhomer> Oh right, Autism is a superpower.

[1:06:08] <James_Quivers> Predators are already autistic, they're obsessed with collecting trophies, lol
[1:06:08] <$lotharrio> Well that's an idea. I can't deny it.
[1:06:09] <%TheYellowcouch> stay classy hollywood
[1:06:09] <%SaiyanShoto> I thought they went to earth chasing a fugitive predator
[1:06:10] <%ironohki> The guy who played the biglarge predator used to hang out at my Parkour gym. He's super nice.

[1:06:23] <Dfreddy8> There's Overlord plot
[1:06:24] <teflonbilly777> I wish Pat would read the autism origin story of Aquaman's nemesis Black Manta on stream and react to it

[1:10:05] <$lotharrio> Dracula... 2001 I think, has that as a vampire weakness. But the higher level vampires are supernatural fast, so it only buys you like three seconds.

[1:20:09] <arkv01> can I give you a brojob, kaidan?
[1:20:11] <peachy996> Council is really just Turian Councilor Sparatus being a dick. Valern and Tevos are more calm
[1:20:14] <+D00msDayDan> i like that it acknowledges that you're a biotic
[1:20:14] <jackelzxaa> kaiden's backstory is so fucking interesting
[1:20:16] <ape_hawk> pat is vanguard
[1:20:18] <James_Quivers> CONATIX! TETSUO!
[1:20:20] <%Agami23> oh, thats the carth?
[1:20:22] <fugly_nick> He's not choosing to save Ashley
[1:20:24] <jackelzxaa> "So humanity was kind of being shitasses"
[1:20:28] <yourliteraldog> I don't like that comander sheapered looks like a PE teacher who was fired Inappropriate conduct
[1:20:30] <%ironohki> Kaiden was my first Carth. I hated him until Ashley made me realize I made the wrongest choice.
[1:20:31] <jackelzxaa> "And then these turians were ultra racist"
[1:20:34] <peachy996> Oh neat speaking of Turian dicks
[1:20:35] <%DJFakie> Don't say Carth, remember the bet
[1:20:40] <%Robot_Nixon_> Is this a new DLC character I don't remember seeing him
[1:20:40] <%ironohki> @Agami23 It's literally Carth's voice actor.
[1:20:41] <%AzureGale> eezo
[1:20:41] <%toolofparanoia> oooh nice, vanguard for ME2 is neat
[1:20:45] <thetunnelhomer> Only fools save Ashely.

[1:20:57] <notsoy> yeah, carth's VA is uh, pretty distinct
[1:20:57] <%jillpilled> This Carth's chin is remarkably high detailed I can't focus on anything else
[1:21:06] <peachy996> Turian Biotics are a thing but are very rare
[1:21:07] <TourettesPlays> is Kaiden supposed to be asian?
[1:21:09] <%ironohki> @thetunnelhomer I was that fool. I am regret.
[1:21:09] <moonmeh> god
[1:21:21] <%TheYellowcouch> There's so much space racism in this game

[1:21:55] <thetunnelhomer> Kaiden is the most Canadian video game character ever.
[1:21:55] <%logoth_> he walked off the psychic torture
[1:21:56] <%GarbageNirvana> What could possibly have gone wrong

[1:23:35] <jackelzxaa> liara is an asari bluepremacist
[1:23:39] <peachy996> I do not like how Liara is forced down your throat the entire series
[1:23:39] <Dfreddy8> *150 years
[1:23:41] <%YakumoYomi> 150?!
[1:23:43] <jorniev> LIARA this is really inappropriate topic for work
[1:23:44] <olaksi> liara acting like she's oh so clueless about human emotions never made any fucking sense to me, we do meet other asari
[1:23:45] <DatAsuna> I'm reminded of the ME3 convo about the head tentacles
[1:23:45] <Hemmy99> She progressively gets better throughout each game
[1:23:46] <+DukeBlack_> you mean 50
[1:23:47] <arkv01> 150? I'll fucking take that
[1:23:48] <$lotharrio> And Salarians live for like what? 20 years?
[1:23:50] <%TheJubbernaut> 1501?!?!?!?!?
[1:23:50] <yourliteraldog> Liaria is the type of gal who only dates humans
[1:23:52] <peachy996> She will always be your friend and you can never kill her off.
[1:23:53] <%Jumpie8> brownLEWD
[1:23:54] <tomahank18> Shepard is canonically 28/29 at this point. She’s the creepy one.
[1:23:54] <%TheLakinessMonster> 150 through future tech
[1:23:55] <Solvari> when does this game play again LUL
[1:23:57] <+evbites> @deviljhojho_ thats the whole asari race it's a insult if you are a pure asari
[1:24:02] <tranquilturnip> 150 in this era of space tech
[1:24:02] <$Futurecity10> We will fuck every alien

[1:24:09] <AmericanaRed> cougar sbfpRichard
[1:24:10] <jackelzxaa> if you don't romance liara in 1 her character becomes WEIRD feeling.  it almost feels like you and her aren't even really friends

[1:32:20] <Sunstalker> Ashley is the human version of the Batarians. Everybody hates them.
[1:32:24] <tomahank18> Garrus has the reach

[1:33:53] <%weissguard> Krogan Progenitor
[1:33:53] <%peanutdot007> 4 balls!
[1:33:54] <jackelzxaa> @peachy996 i checked the wiki and just being a completionist paragon can actually make her unkillable.  the scoring system is pretty detailed on her decision to believe shepard is good or not
[1:33:54] <ChaosedStar> CRACKED THE CODE!
[1:33:55] <nevan_44> D:
[1:33:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> GARRUS IS A BAD COP
[1:33:56] <+senfood> please stop
[1:33:59] <%Monkeyweed21> dude he fuckin kills people
[1:33:59] <yourliteraldog> He is to silly to be a krogan
[1:34:00] <aiutare47> holy shit
[1:34:00] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I knew there was a reason I like Gappy
[1:34:04] <%Varlinator> Makes the genophage soooo much worse. Imagine having 4 balls & ALL 4 of them are worthless!
[1:34:05] <Broken_Sonex> I'M CALLING WREX GAPPY FROM NOW ON
[1:34:05] <+emperri> I hate when people start bleeding profusely
[1:34:06] <$RealThiele> his final nutt
[1:34:06] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I hate being late to the stream. I miss the best parts.
[1:34:09] <jorniev> jojo part 9 is gonna be crazy
[1:34:13] <%Agami23> sort of
[1:34:14] <%dekkitout> Ya know in krogan, Wrex's name can also be pronounced as 'Jo'
[1:34:15] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> THEY  HAVE 4
[1:34:17] <RetributionP> if only zangif had 4 nuts. he could of hidden them away
[1:34:22] <DatAsuna> liara is a quarter krogan on her dad's side
[1:34:26] <DatAsuna> Ergo she has one nut
[1:34:31] <T_Sasquatch> i need to continue part 8 ... its the only one ive just stopped completely and its not bad
[1:34:35] <jackelzxaa> it only takes 4 ashley points to make her unkillable and there are 4 really easy accidental points to gain
[1:34:37] <Dunmarkh> hot
[1:34:38] <viewtifulr> that means they cloned some krogan balls in them
[1:34:40] <DatAsuna> just 1
[1:34:40] <Sunstalker> But how do you defeat these super people with extra organs? D:
[1:34:43] <Dfreddy8> That's rad/bad
[1:34:45] <$RealThiele> i mean id sell my own cloned organs
[1:34:48] <Grandnatics> How do you manage to grow an EXTRA HEART
[1:34:48] <Broken_Sonex> @DatAsuna A single nut. As a treat
[1:34:50] <$Futurecity10> Honestly? if it was 100% success rate, I would do it
[1:34:51] <tomahank18> Sometimes they remove farm animal balls with rubber bands
[1:34:54] <%TheYellowcouch> it's so evil
[1:34:54] <peachy996> Bah roll the dice, I believe Pat can save Based Kirrahe, Kill Kaiden and shoot Ashley in 3
[1:34:55] <+emperri> crazy space cancer
[1:34:56] <%MidnightBurst12> that's horrific
[1:34:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That's super fucked up
[1:35:06] <thesugardaddy111> Krogan nut
[1:35:09] <%QueequegTheater> It's hilariously evil
[1:35:12] <yourliteraldog> Here me out garrus is a bad cop but he isn't a rapist or wife beater so still better than a real cop.
[1:35:21] <slix3431> Fast as fuck booooi
[1:35:35] <tomahank18> Garrus can’t beat a wife he doesn’t have. Big brain.
[1:35:36] <%The_Protagonist> he blew his lab? that seems inappropriate psaJpeg
[1:35:38] <$RealThiele> HQ sus
[1:35:40] <RedPlasticCup> "Why didn't they let me kill the hostages???" Garrus the space cop
[1:35:42] <olaksi> oh garrus, always shooting at the hostages
[1:35:44] <jackelzxaa> kaiden is actually worth keeping around as a whipping boy into 3.  in citadel dlc he gets alot of funny content and you never have to bring him on a mission.  (There's even a check for one scene for it)
[1:35:49] <%Ranryu692> Garrus is fucking stupid
[1:35:51] <DatAsuna> pussies, not wanting to drop exploding ships on houses
[1:35:53] <%peanutdot007> Local Cop just wants to kill all the hostages
[1:35:54] <seancbo> ME1 Garrus is so cool, he's so young and plucky and impressionable
[1:35:55] <RetributionP> eeehhhhh
[1:35:55] <Sunstalker> I make a da organs
[1:36:00] <+evbites> renagade for life
[1:36:03] <%TheYellowcouch> Garrus "fuck them kids"
[1:36:03] <T_Sasquatch> my shepard doesnt give shit about hostages
[1:36:07] <thesugardaddy111> I make a da organs
[1:36:07] <jorniev> HOW
[1:36:08] <%JoshManVGH> Killem all and win Garrus
[1:36:16] <DatAsuna> Garrus wants to kill the hostages AND anyone living below
[1:36:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> He's right
[1:36:21] <%TheYellowcouch> He's such a cop
[1:36:21] <slix3431> That is pussy logic
[1:36:22] <+senfood> GARRUS STOP YOU'RE HOT
[1:36:22] <$RealThiele> fuck the hostages
[1:36:25] <Dunmarkh> based
[1:36:27] <%StaceMcGate> The hostages are all dead, we won guys
[1:36:27] <Grandnatics> Garrus is a psycho cop
[1:36:27] <+mgskomododragon> Tough Choice
[1:36:28] <%miguelrod777> KILL THEM ALL PETER
[1:36:29] <$Futurecity10> To be fair Garrus is right, many more people died
[1:36:29] <yourliteraldog> Oh fuck I forgot how bad he was
[1:36:29] <%Torus1025> Based
[1:36:30] <moonmeh> garrus always has this mindset
[1:36:30] <AmericanaRed> BASED OWL2019DVa
[1:36:30] <%peanutdot007> SAVE THESE PEOPLE BY KILLING THEM
[1:36:30] <viewtifulr> Garres kills for what he wants
[1:36:31] <+evbites> Yes  garrus
[1:36:31] <%dekkitout> That's not very cash money, Garry
[1:36:32] <%YakumoYomi> I am the law!
[1:36:32] <%Varlinator> LOOSE CANON!
[1:36:33] <%toolofparanoia> SET HIM RIGHT PAT
[1:36:33] <RetributionP> he would just make more victims
[1:36:33] <$RealThiele> MORALLY GREY
[1:36:33] <xeros720> i picked a lot of neutral choices when i played me1
[1:36:34] <peachy996> Dr.Heart/Dr. Saleon is probably the only evil Salarian in this series. And he certainly looks the part
[1:36:34] <DatAsuna> collateral damage
[1:36:34] <jorniev> YOURE WRONG
[1:36:34] <T_Sasquatch> hostages are useless , fuck hostages
[1:36:35] <%zyberion626> your influence determines if Garrus becomes Batman or the Punisher
[1:36:35] <$lotharrio> Garrus is a COP ON THE EDGE
[1:36:36] <%Aluminar> dirty garry
[1:36:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> THAT'S A GOOD CHANCE TO KILL ANYONE UNDERNEATH THE SHIP AS IT'S BROUGHT DOWN!
[1:36:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GARRUS YES
[1:36:40] <ARDM112> You're forgetting the part where the hostages are dead either way. It's like deciding not to shoot down the 9/11 planes
[1:36:40] <+senfood> MORALLY GREY
[1:36:41] <seancbo> good ol "GUN EM DOWN" GARRUS! WOO
[1:36:41] <%jillpilled> Psycho cop Garrus
[1:36:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Can't make an omelet etc etc
[1:36:45] <James_Quivers> Garrus watched a lot of Dirty Harry movies
[1:36:45] <viewtifulr> Garres is the new Griffth
[1:36:46] <jackelzxaa> garrus's argument is if you let him get away the hostages all die anyways, it's not the best reasoning but it is like....an argument i guess
[1:36:46] <yourliteraldog> Sherrif Garrus Arpio
[1:36:49] <%RetroCop87> that's genuine regret
[1:36:49] <tomahank18> Garrus is like 25, he’s a young dipshit
[1:36:49] <+GuilKato> Garrus means well @PatStaresAt
[1:36:51] <ChungusQuest> Maybe you're right
[1:36:51] <T_Sasquatch> that guy is going to do worse on a different planet
[1:36:53] <%TheYellowcouch> he's great
[1:36:53] <corncob333> surprisingly reasonable
[1:36:53] <Grandnatics> I'LL SAVE YOU ALL EVEN IF I HAVE TO KILL THEM ALL
[1:36:54] <%MelBrooksKA> Garus, please don't be moreally grey
[1:36:55] <thesugardaddy111> so inorder to kill the person, kill all of the hostages as well
[1:36:56] <AmericanaRed> COPIUM
[1:36:57] <tomahank18> Lmfao
[1:37:00] <Alzero83> you didnt before?
[1:37:00] <%QueequegTheater> He looks at it and says "Fuck, that is kind of crazy"
[1:37:00] <%justcallmebobplease> He was just frustrated and hoping for a simple answer, he knows it wouldn't REALLY work - is how I read it.
[1:37:00] <ape_hawk> cuz hes not a psychocop
[1:37:03] <%Varlinator> <3 Garrus
[1:37:04] <jackelzxaa> garrus is willing to take shepard's lessons to heart right away because he's a good boy
[1:37:04] <peachy996> Because Garrus sees your point?
[1:37:05] <nivlac_555> lol
[1:37:10] <%TheYellowcouch> We love ONE space coppo
[1:37:11] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> THIS IS WHY GARRUS IS A JACKASS
[1:37:12] <%Ranryu692> see, he's more hotheaded and stupid than genuinely psycho
[1:37:16] <AdamLon4> Yes garrus, play the morally grey companion role
[1:37:16] <olaksi> hmm, feels like he's just deflecting there
[1:37:17] <srv4254> garrus is jolee
[1:37:18] <+GingerStrawhat> He looks up to you
[1:37:19] <%AncelDeLambert> "I'm up against a wall, makes me frustrated."
[1:37:19] <TourettesPlays> a wittle fucky wucky
[1:37:20] <thesugardaddy111> it's OK just kill all the hostages
[1:37:20] <James_Quivers> AND WHAT? - Garrus
[1:37:21] <aiutare47> you can call him out at every time and he gets better, then when you arent there in 2 he goes off the rails
[1:37:21] <%ironohki> Garrus I would hate you for your murderous tendencies if you weren't so god fucking sexy.
[1:37:21] <%The_Protagonist> honestly Garrus and Tali are my favorite party members, love their dialogue
[1:37:22] <%SwdVengeance> He's self aware of his own passion to murder criminals
[1:37:22] <$lotharrio> Garrus is your best friend and you should love him.
[1:37:23] <corncob333> garrus with a punisher tshirt
[1:37:25] <%dekkitout> Garry: "These streets be too real, dawg"
[1:37:26] <%logoth_> Maybe cops should have garrus on their cars instead of the punisher
[1:37:27] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Garrus is intelligent enough to recognize he can be wrong
[1:37:28] <%Mathochism> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[1:37:29] <%blutzwavedave> Garrus did NOTHING wrong
[1:37:32] <%Varlinator> He's willing to listen to your reasoning
[1:37:32] <jackelzxaa> i can't wait for garrus to become batman
[1:37:34] <%peanutdot007> @PatStaresAt Garrus is better then Ashley because he knows he's an asshole
[1:37:37] <%toolofparanoia> Garrus is a controlled cannon
[1:37:38] <%Robot_Nixon_> Streets do be cold
[1:37:43] <%dekkitout> "A turrian been through alot, aiight"
[1:37:45] <Sunstalker> And he still ignores all this talk and becomes fkn archangel and gets his shit wrecked
[1:37:45] <T_Sasquatch> congrats you saved hostages and let this guy continue his work LUL
[1:37:46] <%QueequegTheater> @logoth_ unironically a better role model
[1:37:47] <jackelzxaa> garrus did nothing wrong but he sure thought about it a few times
[1:37:47] <%TheYellowcouch> and then you look over to AShley "I can't tell the aliens from the animals" Williams
[1:37:50] <Oxybe> I can see why people want to fuck the bugman
[1:37:53] <olaksi> Garrus did nothing wrong because  the authorities stopped him LUL

[1:38:08] <+GuilKato> also Garrus isn't a space racist :P
[1:38:09] <AmericanaRed> AHHHH SHIT

[1:38:43] <%AzureGale> Dont you mean clans, Wrex
[1:38:44] <%AncelDeLambert> Garrus is that cop that has seen one too many innocent people bite a bullet from a perp and now just assumes they're gonna die. As such, getting the bad guy is what he prioritizes
[1:38:47] <rekinom> That creep from subway strikes again
[1:38:48] <%craigb31> Jarrod from Subway
[1:38:48] <yourliteraldog> Garrus would be one of the officers at the Capital who suggested less force, Ashely would have been the lady who was shot by the secret service.
[1:38:49] <%ironohki> Now imagine this but it's Wookie barks,

[1:40:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Garrus is Anakin Skywalker without the dead mom and dipshit superiors
[1:40:05] <T_Sasquatch> They are the problem and everyone else is the problem
[1:40:05] <peachy996> I think Okeer touches on this too before he kicks the bucket
[1:40:06] <%QueequegTheater> Doesn't Mordin outright state this in 2 or 3?
[1:40:11] <TourettesPlays> so it wasn't technically genocide!
[1:40:13] <%Torus1025> Wrex is a perfect philosopher king and I love him
[1:40:13] <Profmcstevie> if they fuck and not war they'll be fine.....however
[1:40:15] <%peanutdot007> Salarians are assuming that everyone wants to bone all the time
[1:40:17] <%zyberion626> that's exactly what happened.
[1:40:19] <%AncelDeLambert> and that's me being silly
[1:40:19] <%BigCoffee> @TourettesPlays he's close to a thousand I think
[1:40:20] <+InternetShis> So what you're saying is..
[1:40:20] <%AFellowDegen> Mordin goes over this in 2
[1:40:23] <tomahank18> psaGoblin
[1:40:24] <ARDM112> They actually surpassed genophage anyway and Mordin had to update it
[1:40:24] <ChungusQuest> Why breed when you can KILL
[1:40:25] <+InternetShis> APATHY IS DEATH?
[1:40:26] <ハクア> yeah, mordin says exactly that in me2
[1:40:27] <+evbites> @PatStaresAt also the salirains gave them space tech when the krogan were cave men
[1:40:27] <jorniev> ooooh
[1:40:27] <jackelzxaa> mordin goes into alot of this
[1:40:29] <James_Quivers> That's Mordins whole reasoning behind it, he thought it was fine from a logistical standpoint but it fails in a cultural context
[1:40:36] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> So you're saying... Tuchanka is japan?
[1:40:37] <%slackware98> genophage.. or covid?
[1:40:37] <tranquilturnip> they aren't adapting
[1:40:37] <Sunstalker> Not too mention that th genophage makes them feel it's worthless to actually try that plan
[1:40:37] <$lotharrio> They briefly did. But like by the 10th mass birthing of stillborn children, it started to break their spirit.
[1:40:38] <dd44dostivei> of course the salarians are going to think super practically
[1:40:39] <%kyh9> I always liked how grey the genophage problem was
[1:40:39] <%dekkitout> Woops, all genocide
[1:40:42] <jackelzxaa> his modification tried to get closer to the original goal yeah
[1:40:44] <Gorshum> It seems like the moral of every story in here is science bad.
[1:40:48] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt the thing with the Genophage is that it was arguably the right decision at the time, whilst simultaneously being a horrific monstrous thing. The whole point is that it's massively grey no matter how you slice it. Arguments on both sides have merit.
[1:40:49] <jorniev> they didnt take culture into acount
[1:40:49] <Pookiedaexzile> That just sounds like Genocide with more steps
[1:40:55] <stantheman_97> krogan are too violent and turned a population control method into genocide
[1:40:55] <jackelzxaa> mordin's moral struggle is genuinely fascinating and complex
[1:40:56] <greatspaceadventure> what's the difference? Kappa
[1:40:57] <Broken_Sonex> Salarians didn't count on them being assholes
[1:40:59] <$RealThiele> crush is the name for a metting, real productive sounding
[1:41:00] <DatAsuna> @InternetShis according to ludo kresh and not kreia, yes.
[1:41:02] <JetpackMcQuack> Let me tweak some more
[1:41:05] <jackelzxaa> it's actually "no it's actually complex he's well written"
[1:41:06] <%captainpodock> wait what about Krogab culture prevents then maintaining population? just their disposition towards violence?
[1:41:08] <thetunnelhomer> That's why competely reversing the Genophage in 3 sat weirdly with me.
[1:41:08] <%kyh9> Krogan literally will take over the galaxy if left on their own.
[1:41:12] <%Mekhet09> @RubberFistFight Which is why ME3 shits always against it.
[1:41:12] <AmericanaRed> sbfpVita
[1:41:17] <seancbo> >Man that wants to fight literally all the time says he wants to talk >Actually wants to fight >Shocked pikachu
[1:41:19] <+D00msDayDan> cotton eye joe
[1:41:22] <AmericanaRed> SPOOKY SCARY
[1:41:22] <%ironohki> Statistical testicle
[1:41:24] <yourliteraldog> The nazi's used math and science to argue how ethical the holocaust was.
[1:41:25] <%AncelDeLambert> it's statistical, but not psychological
[1:41:25] <+evbites> @Broken_Sonex they knew they were assholes they gave cavemen nukes
[1:41:28] <%Agami23> thats metal
[1:41:32] <BlueLunecy> Pro-tip, statistics are bullshit
[1:41:35] <peachy996> You get 1 kid if you're lucky
[1:41:36] <aiutare47> Its terrifying in its cold thorough nature
[1:41:37] <%ironohki> @D00msDayDan I'dd been married long time ago
[1:41:38] <+senfood> The genophage is eugenics in the most literal sense of the term.
[1:41:39] <ARDM112> You get to see a bunch of dead babies
[1:41:41] <Sp3ctre48> It's a cycle of bad scenarios, The genophage was not a bad thing at the time, but Krogan culture wasn't ready to exist in a way that could endure that
[1:41:45] <$RealThiele> yea thats alotta trauma
[1:41:50] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex Well asshole to each other.
[1:41:57] <Pookiedaexzile> The Big problem is Sterilzation of species that is sentient
[1:41:57] <Profmcstevie> Need a good batch
[1:41:59] <Sunstalker> @captainpodock They can't stop fighting and doing dangerous stuff.
[1:42:01] <T_Sasquatch> The genophage is fucked but the krogan WILL take over the galaxy if you let them
[1:42:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats fucked up
[1:42:05] <+senfood> aka The Banality of Evil
[1:42:07] <%AncelDeLambert> the genophage needed a programmed in time limit
[1:42:09] <+InternetShis> They uplifted them for war and neutered them
[1:42:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Regardless
[1:42:12] <$lotharrio> My parents had a still birth and they waited like ten years before they tried for another kid.
[1:42:13] <Grandnatics> With Jarrod being Wrex's father and being a Krogan Rebellion veteran, this implies that Wrex is about ~1200 to 1400 years old
[1:42:19] <%dekkitout> D:
[1:42:20] <+evbites> the krogan is what happens when there is no prime directive,
[1:42:27] <AmericanaRed> sbfpRage sbfpRage sbfpRage sbfpRage
[1:42:34] <%UvBenServed> Completely forgot that part
[1:42:39] <jorniev> WREX PRINCE OF EDENIA
[1:42:40] <Sp3ctre48> Like the Krogan really should be practicing population control to avoid potential wars, but culturally they were still in their warmonger phase so they didn't care
[1:42:46] <%dekkitout> HIS DAD'S A NECROMANCER TOO?!
[1:42:48] <Broken_Sonex> @Grandnatics Old Boi
[1:42:49] <%captainpodock> @grandnatics So he's like a grandad here?
[1:42:49] <tomahank18> psaGoblin I got this from a Pat blind box and it told me to show off
[1:42:50] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Wrex is the best.
[1:42:50] <%AncelDeLambert> KAH'PLAH!
[1:42:50] <jackelzxaa> @AncelDeLambert thats something that comes up in 2
[1:42:57] <deviljhojho_> god wrex is so fucking metal
[1:42:57] <%jillpilled> PogChamp That's metal
[1:42:58] <%dave323dave> I remember Mordin emphasizing how the Krogan didnt have a unifying culture to warrant curing the genophage. Not until Wrex took over
[1:42:59] <%SkyfireHero> they should have made it so there weren't any dead babies
[1:43:01] <RetributionP> never ever
[1:43:02] <aiutare47> The most fascinating part of the genophage is its largely considered necessary, even Krogan admit "Yeah we wouldve fucked them up if they hadnt"
[1:43:02] <%Ranryu692> Yeah.. you'll never go back LUL
[1:43:02] <stantheman_97> metal
[1:43:02] <+senfood> Wrex is metal as fuck.
[1:43:03] <jackelzxaa> the krogan evolutionary system creates redundant organs
[1:43:05] <T_Sasquatch> sure buddy
[1:43:08] <mr_saturday93> Kratos: This man understands
[1:43:15] <RubberFistFight> @Sp3ctre48 Was it the Krogan who were "uplifted" into essentially war machines and then got out of control afterwards?
[1:43:19] <T_Sasquatch> aww
[1:43:20] <+InternetShis> Fun fact about animals, eyes on the side are a prey species evolution, but krogan use them to hunt in every direction
[1:43:21] <jorniev> WREAV
[1:43:24] <TourettesPlays> "my brother is a huge dickhead thats about it"
[1:43:25] <+GuilKato> yes Wrex yes we are making you cry so Shepard can hug you
[1:43:27] <peachy996> I think Krogan cry?
[1:43:28] <%ironohki> They don't get their ass kicked.
[1:43:29] <%BigCoffee> @Sp3ctre48 yes
[1:43:30] <HeroToxiko> way stronger backs too
[1:43:30] <aiutare47> @RubberFistFight basically yeah
[1:43:31] <yourliteraldog> Wrex is literally a Philosopher King
[1:43:32] <$lotharrio> Krogans spit on Klingons.
[1:43:33] <HeroToxiko> and smarter
[1:43:33] <%Mekhet09> They're also more scary.
[1:43:34] <Grandnatics> I mean he might have kids? Unlikely for Wrex
[1:43:34] <+jjjdanny> fighting words
[1:43:36] <deviljhojho_> krogan admit they are pieces of shit a lot of the time too
[1:43:36] <%derpy_platypus> Worf is useless
[1:43:36] <%SirGO0SE> they have huge honor
[1:43:38] <%Rumbutt> Krogan are the best part of ME hand down
[1:43:38] <no123450n> their ridges are bigger, too
[1:43:40] <%Maids4lyfe> THEY DON'T GET BODIED BY PLASTIC BARRELS
[1:43:40] <%dekkitout> Can Krogans recite Shakespeare?
[1:43:42] <%walternatorz> they're so awesome they literally had to be nerfed
[1:43:44] <%peanutdot007> Basically everyone learned from Worf in DS9 for their Klingon ripoffs
[1:43:44] <%Monkeyweed21> they aren't constrained by a costume budget
[1:43:46] <corncob333> wrex didnt get owned by a barrel
[1:43:46] <yeshua723> just saw the thing about David Cage and Pat’s tweet
[1:43:47] <karl_rex> I forgot Wrex was super old and was probably born before 1000 AD
[1:43:47] <+senfood> Do Klingon have four balls?
[1:43:48] <+allups> Klingons are kinda lame
[1:43:49] <%TheYellowcouch> wrex would not die from a plastic barrel
[1:43:50] <%UvBenServed> Teenage Mutant Ninja Krogans
[1:43:51] <%TheYellowcouch> he is tough
[1:43:51] <Dunmarkh> wrex could kill that plastic barrel
[1:43:53] <Alzero83> So the Husks are the Borg? @PatStaresAt
[1:43:54] <ChungusQuest> Krogans show, Klingons tell
[1:43:54] <twoto858> aaaaaaand there's the quest
[1:43:55] <thewhiterice92> cuz they're huge lizard people
[1:43:57] <peachy996> Nvm I'm thinking of the Krogan poet in 2
[1:43:58] <jorniev> ONE KROGAN SURVIVED A FALL FROM ORBIT AND GOT MAD PUSS
[1:43:58] <digaogrunge> Big turtle man is good
[1:44:00] <+InternetShis> Krogan don't get Worf'd
[1:44:00] <RubberFistFight> @Maids4lyfe PLASTIC BARREL HAS NO HONOUR
[1:44:13] <tomahank18> Imagine how much of a mess you’d make with twice as many balls
[1:44:13] <%captainpodock> Wrex would kick the shit out of Worf
[1:44:17] <%Garthunox> end of the day, every race in Star Trek, every race is still human looking
[1:44:18] <+InternetShis> Bri'ish bird man
[1:44:19] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[1:44:20] <SaltyAzteca> We need that armor
[1:44:23] <%toolofparanoia> LETS KILL A TURIAN WAR CRIMINAL
[1:44:24] <%Ranryu692> Wrex is Killmonger confirmed
[1:44:26] <%Maids4lyfe> OH SO HE'S SPACE BRITISH
[1:44:27] <yourliteraldog> This like if we steralized Japan after the nuke.
[1:44:27] <pronooblet> Wrex PogChamp
[1:44:27] <%dekkitout> Was not expecting Turrinan gold...
[1:44:28] <viewtifulr> so museums huh?
[1:44:29] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 Yeah, like I said it's a cycle of bad scenarios where no one is really correct, the Salarians did what they had to do to survive the Rachni wars, which resulted in the situation they're in
[1:44:30] <Alzero83> Are Geth the Borg or Husks @PatStaresAt
[1:44:34] <dd44dostivei> gonna killmonger this scene
[1:44:37] <$lotharrio> Worf, your spine is so strong and advanced that this empty barrel crushed it and it's impossible to fix, now.
[1:44:43] <+evbites> @Garthunox mass effct is star track with a budget
[1:44:43] <%ironohki> Wrex.
[1:44:44] <%StaceMcGate> So....Wrex is cool
[1:44:47] <%logoth_> Shepard
[1:44:49] <+InternetShis> He's gonna put them in a museum on Palevan
[1:44:51] <Oxybe> Kicking the shit out of Worf isn't hard, narratively speaking.
[1:44:51] <%toolofparanoia> LETS KILL DA HOE
[1:44:52] <AmericanaRed> when's XCOM 3 BibleThump BibleThump
[1:44:54] <Alzero83> Who are the Borg in the ME universe @PatStaresAt ?
[1:44:55] <RaidenRising> wrex
[1:44:56] <+InternetShis> Wrex.
[1:44:57] <pronooblet> Commaaaaander Shepard
[1:44:57] <%logoth_> Wrex
[1:44:59] <peachy996> It bears reminding that Turians are equally responsible for the Genophage as the Salarians
[1:45:00] <jorniev> WREX?
[1:45:01] <+athuramn> wrex
[1:45:02] <SaltyAzteca> you dont understand we NEED that armor
[1:45:03] <yourliteraldog> Geth aren't borg, they are actually unique
[1:45:06] <%Agami23> wrex seems pretty great
[1:45:06] <+InternetShis> WHAT UP, XENOPHILE?
[1:45:07] <Sp3ctre48> @Alzero83 The Reapers
[1:45:08] <+evbites> @Alzero83 the reapers
[1:45:09] <%ironohki> Shepard.
[1:45:13] <Lamokmok> Oh the other racist!
[1:45:14] <%goose_attack_almanac> HEY WIFE
[1:45:17] <peachy996> The Salarians made it but it was the Turians who insisted on it being deployed
[1:45:19] <Savior127> God damn this makes me mad about Andromeda even more
[1:45:19] <$lotharrio> Reapers are pretty much Borg, yeah.
[1:45:20] <pronooblet> Wrex
[1:45:29] <AmericanaRed> SHIP: BRIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEMMMMM
[1:45:30] <tomahank18> Shepard
[1:45:30] <viewtifulr> make the ship loud then
[1:45:30] <Grandnatics> Enjoying your TECH ESPIONAGE, TALI?
[1:45:31] <peachy996> You'll find out later in the Citadel DLC
[1:45:35] <%miguelrod777> come give uncle sheoard a kiss
[1:45:35] <Alzero83> Geth seem more Borg like
[1:45:42] <%StaceMcGate> We will Bang in ME 2 okay?
[1:45:44] <RubberFistFight> @Agami23 the cool thing about Wrex is that he's reasonable.
[1:45:44] <rekinom> She brings back shepherds dick in a pickle jar
[1:45:48] <James_Quivers> "Sorry Bioware didn't think people would wanna bang you until 2 came out, Tali, I'll be with the blue chick til then"
[1:45:54] <%ironohki> Hey remember when Jayne Cobb was a Quarian thug?
[1:45:54] <no123450n> daddy issues in the whole crew
[1:45:55] <Sp3ctre48> tbf the Krogan were literally dropping asteroids on the Turian's homeworld, they were very desperate
[1:45:56] <Pookiedaexzile> I don't get why you give the Salarians a Pass on the genophasge but not the Qurians
[1:45:58] <%captain_thickthighs> Tali big hips and no bugs best girl
[1:46:00] <aiutare47> Navy brat, but still cool
[1:46:03] <Alzero83> Tali Romance in ME2 or Bust, Pat
[1:46:04] <%NocturneNovember> Oh my god, I discovered the worst thing about David Cage's birthday.  He was born June 9, 1969, meaning he was born 6/9/69. He doesn't deserve that birthday.
[1:46:05] <%AncelDeLambert> the only thing I remember about her father is how he fucks up in 3

[1:46:29] <ARDM112> Yeah, you will totally never be an admiral Tali, that'll never happen LUL
[1:46:29] <peachy996> It's true, the Krogan gave the Turian good reasaon to say "well fuck you"
[1:46:32] <ammobasket> she's got those lumps
[1:46:32] <%captain_thickthighs> Daddys issues mean opportunity
[1:46:35] <RetributionP> PAT WITH THE TRASH PRINCESS
[1:46:35] <Sunstalker> @Pookiedaexzile Because the Geth weren't agressors. They fought a defensive war
[1:46:40] <+InternetShis> We can fix her, Pat
[1:46:44] <yourliteraldog> Geth are what AI is going to be if we don't teach ethics and treat it with respect.
[1:46:48] <pronooblet> Smashley Kappa
[1:46:52] <peachy996> Not just the Genophage but the bomb on Tuchanka

[1:48:25] <%transporterthesequel> Wait....are Space Elves ALWAYS fucking the universe?
[1:48:27] <seancbo> I hated how black and white ME3 tried to make the Geth/Quarian situation. The only good robot is a dead robot, fuck em
[1:48:33] <TourettesPlays> @solidgoldtoast they literally summon the reapers to the galaxy again
[1:48:34] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat Did you hear about NASA's newest strategy to get a manned mission to Mars? They're going to planet.
[1:48:34] <Sp3ctre48> I like how it's played pretty neutrally most of the time, but then in 3 the Quarians literally tried to genocide the Geth
[1:48:35] <Solvari> our cursed enemy that we created
[1:48:35] <Ipsenscastle> @MichelangeloStark on console it's a MUCH better experience
[1:48:39] <deviljhojho_> Look man from shepard's perspective he cant fuck a geth
[1:48:41] <slix3431> I don't care if she is a colonizer. I'll colonize-HER
[1:48:44] <deviljhojho_> the choice is obvious
[1:48:44] <%JoshManVGH> "They won't stop not fucking with out shit, Sheperd!"
[1:48:45] <yourliteraldog> @dekkitout That is actually the best case scenario if we give the AI the feels, but idk some of those silicon valley dudes are alittle rapey
[1:48:48] <+flexin_apex> Geth did nothing wrong
[1:48:52] <%captain_thickthighs> First we need to build settlements on the space strip
[1:48:54] <%TheYellowcouch> I can change her
[1:48:56] <%transporterthesequel> Wait
[1:48:56] <seancbo> @Sp3ctre48 exactly. I always kill the geth out of spite
[1:48:56] <%Torus1025> @internetshis I didn't know about politics last time I played this
[1:49:01] <%Torus1025> rip
[1:49:01] <ARDM112> Geth weren't evil but quarians didn't know that and had no way of knowing that.  Even pre-ME3, they're plenty of examples of AIs and VIs going genocidal. It was either attack them immediately or do a coin toss on whether or not the geth will genocide them.
[1:49:04] <+InternetShis> @transporterthesequel The asari are the space elves here, but still yes
[1:49:07] <T_Sasquatch> @seancbo based
[1:49:09] <%transporterthesequel> Did a fucking PRINCESS JUST GO LOL BOOTSTRAPS
[1:49:10] <AmericanaRed> damn gurl
[1:49:11] <Sp3ctre48> The Geth actually did nothing wrong, the Quarians swung first LUL
[1:49:13] <%QueequegTheater> Fuck those clankers
[1:49:16] <+evbites> @seancbo nah it was still grey and irrelevant if you pick destroy
[1:49:20] <%jillpilled> the geth are actual good boys
[1:49:22] <aiutare47> Tali is a young child of a Admiral, its akin to the 17 yr old daughter of a 4 star general going "Yeah, we're defending freedom and killing terrorists" when asked about the middle east.
[1:49:23] <yourliteraldog> Geth are so fucking based
[1:49:23] <+MonocleGrizzly> @torus1025 a lot of us didn’t lol
[1:49:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Which is why you ignore the plight of the Krogan
[1:49:27] <%Maids4lyfe> the geth were innocent
[1:49:28] <SaltyAzteca> You love the geth, or one particular geth?
[1:49:29] <deviljhojho_> im jealous of anything with eternal life
[1:49:29] <Sunstalker> The Geth did nothing wrong. kinamaGun
[1:49:31] <T_Sasquatch> i dont hate the geth but im not putting robot lives over living things
[1:49:34] <RubberFistFight> @ARDM112 It's not that deep - the Quarians didn't like that their slaves were asking questions.
[1:49:34] <%TheYellowcouch> That one conversation with Tali about hte start of the conflict made me real sympathetic to the geth
[1:49:34] <+evbites> Robots are not alive
[1:49:36] <peachy996> I kill the Quarians more often than I kill the Geth. In runs where I have to make a choice
[1:49:36] <thewhiterice92> i had to choose the entire geth or tali
[1:49:39] <%Maids4lyfe> the quarians murdered them because a geth asked if it had a soul
[1:49:40] <%dekkitout> @yourliteraldog Fair counterpoint. I believe the adequate resolution to that involves mechs
[1:49:41] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The Geth were actually super cool till Reaper influence.
[1:49:43] <peachy996> Fuck the Quarians, they're shit
[1:49:44] <seancbo> Even if I have high enough points to save both and have a peaceful solution I still dunk on the toasters
[1:49:46] <%TheYellowcouch> WHICH WAS NOT HER PLAN
[1:49:52] <%DianaTheAscian> so far I'm super unimpressed by Tali
[1:49:54] <ape_hawk> "DADDY WASNT THERE, TO TAKE ME TO THE FAIR!"
[1:49:55] <Sp3ctre48> I love the Geth because the Quarians are braindead a lot the time
[1:49:55] <deviljhojho_> Look geth arent people but its still wrong to kill them
[1:49:57] <T_Sasquatch> @Maids4lyfe as they SHOULD
[1:49:58] <James_Quivers> Guys, they can't be 'colonizers' when the quarians were literally the only ones on the planet, stop trying to match a video game to RL politics ffs
[1:50:00] <Grandnatics> God the Military Princess is EXTREME
[1:50:00] <Sunstalker> is Tali just fucking Megan Mccain? D:
[1:50:00] <$lotharrio> Despite being baddies in this one, there's plenty of hints that the Geth, as a whole, are good people.
[1:50:01] <aiutare47> Tali is just a child of propaganda
[1:50:01] <RubberFistFight> @thewhiterice92 I threaded that needle and got to choose both.
[1:50:03] <seancbo> besides, tali a cute
[1:50:06] <deviljhojho_> just like its bad to kill gorillas or something i dunno im bad at analogies
[1:50:06] <Sp3ctre48> except Tali, I love her <3
[1:50:14] <%Maids4lyfe> fuck off
[1:50:18] <kylejburke> hmm, hope nothing bad happens to tali's dad
[1:50:18] <+evbites> @Maids4lyfe i would thats fucking scary
[1:50:20] <arkv01> daddy issues huh? Girl you can call me daddy too...
[1:50:21] <+D00msDayDan> well yeah, he has that helmet on
[1:50:22] <yourliteraldog> Geth where all like hey dad are we slaves? That's fucked.
[1:50:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Qurussy be hittin different
[1:50:23] <ARDM112> The geth also did a lot of wrong things to people other than quarians. You literally have to brainwash them into not siding with the Reapers.
[1:50:27] <peachy996> But in my better runs I pick both
[1:50:29] <deviljhojho_> thats a big brained take
[1:50:32] <tomahank18> So Garrus is a cop fuck and Tali is a colonizer
[1:50:49] <+InternetShis> This is still silver age Bioware, this IS politics
[1:50:50] <James_Quivers> They're like 7 different cultural references in one
[1:50:50] <%StaceMcGate> Gypsies namely
[1:50:51] <Blank9> yeah matching real life to fantasy doesn't work a lot of times
[1:50:54] <MichelangeloStark> @Ipsenscastle the legendary edition, i take it. usually when it comes to these things, its very polarizing but seems like console legendary vs console OG games debate is mostly "legendary is great"
[1:50:55] <Pookiedaexzile> But think about what Bioware in 2007 was thinking
[1:50:57] <%TheYellowcouch> morally grey
[1:50:57] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> and 3, they are stock photos
[1:50:58] <TourettesPlays> @lotharrio the problem is that it's almost trivial to reprogram billions of them and suddenly you've got an army
[1:50:59] <%cvp5127> morally grey
[1:50:59] <%Torus1025> True
[1:51:00] <solidgoldtoast> Basically
[1:51:00] <+senfood> There's a difference between politics and objective morality.
[1:51:00] <Grandnatics> "Tell me what your sweat tastes like." - Bioware Forum Shepard
[1:51:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> VERY ATTRACTIVE.
[1:51:01] <deviljhojho_> the ultimate in morally grey tech
[1:51:01] <%AbnormalVoid> Morally Grey
[1:51:02] <AmericanaRed> RUH ROH
[1:51:03] <wasdsf> but they are hot so they are morally grey
[1:51:05] <Alzero83> Kee'lah Seelai
[1:51:05] <LeotheHuntsman> my kind of woman
[1:51:06] <%derpy_platypus> So an anti-hero?
[1:51:06] <%jillpilled> Literally everyone on this ship, yes. Tali especially though LUL
[1:51:07] <%valriot> Morally Purple
[1:51:08] <Solvari> Nerds in a hazmat suit
[1:51:10] <Blank9> like instant church in fantasy = catholic church of the crusades exclusively
[1:51:10] <iosephe> morally gray
[1:51:11] <RedPlasticCup> nah, thats a copout answer. everything is political.
[1:51:12] <%SkyfireHero> so morally grey
[1:51:12] <plaguedoctor_syan> Morally gray
[1:51:13] <Sunstalker> @ARDM112 ? Wasn't it breaking their brainwashing from the reapers?
[1:51:13] <+D00msDayDan> thanks pat
[1:51:13] <+InternetShis> Morally genocidal
[1:51:14] <MichelangeloStark> wait, who are wrong? the Asari?
[1:51:14] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt way way back when I streamed ME2, I had someone get so fucking mad at me in chat when it got to the "indentured servitude" side-quests, because I wouldn't agree with them trying to force their own view of it via the lens of contemporary politics on me.
[1:51:14] <%Torus1025> @tomahank18 They get cool later
[1:51:15] <rekinom> Wow this woman is a genocidal maniac but also she's super hot so who knows
[1:51:15] <$Futurecity10> The geth never sent any peace envoy's either
[1:51:18] <Broken_Sonex> VERY HOT AND VERY WRONG
[1:51:18] <%jillpilled> Only Joker, Kaidan are excluded
[1:51:18] <viewtifulr> who knew being wrong can make you hot
[1:51:20] <solidgoldtoast> The Quarians are wrong but they got thick thighs so they're morally grey
[1:51:22] <%captain_thickthighs> for politics des2 is now have race baiting as a theme now
[1:51:24] <%StaceMcGate> Quarians are very attractive photoshopped models
[1:51:27] <%JoshManVGH> Ah yes, "Fuckable Wrong" the best kind of wrong!
[1:51:28] <James_Quivers> MORALLY HOT
[1:51:29] <vVAstrAVv> so morally gray?
[1:51:35] <%QueequegTheater> "If anything it makes her hotter"
[1:51:36] <%TheYellowcouch> oh no
[1:51:37] <%derpy_platypus> jk.... unless?
[1:51:37] <$Faustgesicht> They are ignorant from the their self-imposed exile
[1:51:37] <T_Sasquatch> QUARIANS DID NOTHING WRONG BUT LOSE
[1:51:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh the ole Gal Gadot
[1:51:38] <%haic26> morally grey?
[1:51:39] <+InternetShis> Lemme get that purple snatch and take the throne
[1:51:39] <%cvp5127> go on
[1:51:39] <corncob333> "guys I can fix her"
[1:51:39] <AmericanaRed> NO RED FLAGS AT ALL
[1:51:40] <aiutare47> THATS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
[1:51:41] <Solvari> KKona
[1:51:45] <seancbo> To be fair, the brainwash vs destroy decision in the Legion loyalty mission is one of the best moral choices in the series
[1:51:45] <Savior127> "I can fix her"
[1:51:45] <Ipsenscastle> @MichelangeloStark that and it's the only way to play it on current console hardware anyway, so the point becomes kind of moot, I guess
[1:51:46] <Sp3ctre48> That's so hot
[1:51:47] <%walternatorz> that's so interesting
[1:51:48] <+MonocleGrizzly> Morally grey = fuckable
[1:51:48] <%TheYellowcouch> ....Is it bad that that made her more attractive to me???
[1:51:48] <+SinnerEbru> "my dad's an IDF general (:"
[1:51:49] <%transporterthesequel> MORALLY ELF
[1:51:49] <$Futurecity10> Thats crazy, show me your butthole
[1:51:49] <Alzero83> crazy....and hawt

[1:51:51] <+InternetShis> We can fix her
[1:51:53] <+GuilKato> you didn't check in with your quartermaster! he might have new gunes
[1:51:57] <ChaosedStar> The geth were created n was going to be deleted. they didn't need to be peaceful lol
[1:51:58] <+GuilKato> or let you sell guns to him
[1:52:01] <solidgoldtoast> @Savior127 You literally can tho
[1:52:02] <%BigCoffee> Oh ma gawd Sheppar
[1:52:03] <James_Quivers> Like when Obama said he pretended to be into socialist literature jsut to get with college girls LMAO
[1:52:03] <%afronooch> "oh wow big hero"
[1:52:03] <deviljhojho_> Please stop youre ruining her ass
[1:52:04] <$lotharrio> "My dad's a general and he has a lot of opinions on people from the Middle East. I LOVE your car!"
[1:52:07] <SaltyAzteca> *hair flick*
[1:52:08] <Pookiedaexzile> "Damn girl forreal war crimes that's crazy"
[1:52:09] <Solvari> I failed to fix the toaster but maybe I can fix her
[1:52:10] <%JoshManVGH> "You're dumb but big bonkers, keep talking"
[1:52:11] <+GuilKato> what about talking to kaidan
[1:52:15] <viewtifulr> i can fix her with my blue slushie dick
[1:52:16] <%jillpilled> Wow, very cool Tali
[1:52:16] <tranquilturnip> "My dad helps control the fate of my entire ethnostate"
[1:52:16] <peachy996> I find it fascinating how people still have intense debates about this game to this day
[1:52:17] <deviljhojho_> YOURE RUINING THIS FOR ME BRO
[1:52:17] <%bugz_munny> I should go
[1:52:17] <Alzero83> ...and hawtr
[1:52:19] <%Monkeyweed21> WELL SHE'S A BITCH AND A GHOUL AND SHE LOOKS LIKE A RAAAAT
[1:52:19] <wasdsf> eat your vegetables or the robots win
[1:52:20] <thetunnelhomer> Oh god, I think Pat just ruined Tali for me
[1:52:20] <%valriot> Wow youre so interesting and pretty
[1:52:20] <aiutare47> She's just a kid who was told that the Geth killed all her race and theyre evil and they need to die.
[1:52:21] <RubberFistFight> "My dad is like this guy, you might know him, his name is Space Oppenheimer, he helped make the space nukes..."
[1:52:21] <ARDM112> @Sunstalker The thing is, there's literally no difference between the two of those. Legion says some difference in some mathematical constant makes them like the Reapers, but who says that Legion's version of that constant is actually correct and not just as arbitrary?
[1:52:22] <rekinom> "Wow that's crazy so like do you have a cloaca or?"
[1:52:23] <+InternetShis> "I served in the IDFuhh"
[1:52:27] <TourettesPlays> Subtle acting Pat, very nice
[1:52:29] <deviljhojho_> THIS CANT BE
[1:52:32] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "So my dad, Ronald Reagan..."
[1:52:32] <Jonny_Uppercut> Wow Tali that's crazy, you ever try DMT?
[1:52:33] <%captain_thickthighs> do the Russian girls in my college that threaten death because of who their dads were it was kind of hilarious. I was here in pure stories from the taxi drivers
[1:52:33] <%skeleklng> Should I play Destiny 2 y/n
[1:52:34] <solidgoldtoast> YOU'RE MAKING IT BETTER
[1:52:36] <Broken_Sonex> "Oh wow, yeah, dad's a big hero, yeah......" @PatStaresAt
[1:52:37] <Dunmarkh> Purple Ashley
[1:52:37] <peachy996> People STILL argue about the Genophage on 4chan and whether it was right or wrong
[1:52:38] <%TheYellowcouch> Twirls hair "haha warcrimes? your're sooo funny"
[1:52:39] <%dekkitout> "wow, there's like- so much pathos in that, Tali...~"
[1:52:41] <%GalacticaPhanto> @solvari holy shit that's so good
[1:52:46] <yourliteraldog> But yeah if we build AI we need it to read every piece of literature in the field of Philosophy on ethics and virture
[1:52:49] <%psidefx> y&n
[1:52:51] <+senfood> Garrus: RUINED. Tali: RUINED. Wrex: You're cool.
[1:52:53] <+GuilKato> collect the info beside pressly on the console beside the galaxy map @PatStaresAt
[1:52:57] <+Rebellious_gate> The Geth are cool but I'll flush their race down the toilet for some of that hot Quarian ass
[1:52:58] <%AbnormalVoid> boners make you stupid
[1:52:59] <aiutare47> yeah
[1:53:00] <%cvp5127> but
[1:53:00] <MichelangeloStark> @Ipsenscastle yeah but for those who have the games already like me, its more "am i still good with what i got or are the changes so significant and for the better that I should get the legendary edition"
[1:53:01] <%Jumpie8> yep
[1:53:02] <tranquilturnip> Hot Evil
[1:53:02] <aiutare47> it happens
[1:53:02] <%transporterthesequel> I mean, she did literally say, "I'm a princess" before saying, "YEAH YOU GOTTA PULL YOURSELF UP BY YOUR BOOTSTRAPS."
[1:53:05] <%SkyfireHero> Mr Feel was portraying her as a little sister you might wanna bone
[1:53:05] <yourliteraldog> Been there
[1:53:07] <deviljhojho_> the college experience
[1:53:07] <%derpy_platypus> but the bone zone
[1:53:09] <%MidnightBurst12> oh boy
[1:53:09] <iosephe> But she's hot!

[1:53:23] <RubberFistFight> @ARDM112 Legion explained how the Reapers' meddling essentially introduced a forced rounding error in the "converted" Geth, leading to imprecise conclusions.
[1:53:23] <+evbites> @yourliteraldog but what if it comes to the conclusion that life is meaningless

[1:54:09] <%TheLakinessMonster> The hotter the girl the crazier/more she can get away with being. Look at Neekolul, big tax the rich type of person, but then shows off her 2 million mansion.
[1:54:10] <+GuilKato> @PatStaresAt shy do you keep skipping the info on the panel next to Pressley?
[1:54:11] <%transporterthesequel> LAB THE TALI MATCHUP
[1:54:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> Tali is an adorable little racist.
[1:54:14] <+InternetShis> When it comes time for her loyalty mission, DO WE FUCK HER OVER
[1:54:14] <SaltyAzteca> You can be adorable and absolutely wrong
[1:54:15] <%JoshManVGH> Pat replaying RE2 while talking to hot chicks in college
[1:54:17] <DatAsuna> You can be cute and radicalised.
[1:54:19] <%lockhead45> jack better pick her!
[1:54:20] <TourettesPlays> Reminder that Tali sees Shepard as more of a parental figure and sleeping with her is irresponsible and wrong
[1:54:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Jack is worth it
[1:54:24] <RetributionP> pat getting cardio running around the map
[1:54:24] <+yoshkosh20> My little genocider can't be this cute.

[1:54:29] <Sp3ctre48> You can think Tali is adorable and that the Quarians are stupid, it isn't mutually exclusive
[1:54:29] <DatAsuna> Gal gadot is very cute, but also oof
[1:54:30] <%zyberion626> Tali is wrong, but you can't blame her
[1:54:32] <+alphonseisbest> OOOH WHOES THE TALI COUNTER PICK!

[1:55:20] <%TheYellowcouch> oh this is nuts these menus are so different from the ps4 version
[1:55:20] <ARDM112> @RubberFistFight Is that error actually an error, though? It doesn't seem to cause the geth to malfunction in any other way. It's an error to Legion because it's different from how he's coded. Both in his loyalty mission and in 3 you don't convince the geth, you just reprogram them. The geth don't choose to stop helping Reapers, you and Legion choose for them. And BTW, originally they contacted the Reapers willingly.

[1:58:10] <aiutare47> @dekkitout its a moderate size fission, but I dont know how its done in the future
[1:58:11] <RrenKrieg> @dekkitout i mean i think it's overkill for a probe's self-destruct module
[1:58:11] <%JoshManVGH> Was The Game and the art of "neg-ing" written by someone watching a couple like Pat and Paige and thinking "Of Course! Call women dumb to their face and they will hop on your dick!" like they clearly had no idea what they were seeing?
[1:58:11] <peachy996> Oh Cool! I hear they fixed this sidemission so it made more sense plot wise.
[1:58:13] <%BigCoffee> @zyberion626 possible world ending war with an alien race?

[2:00:15] <James_Quivers> James in 3 is the only cool human squadmate in this entire series
[2:00:17] <fritz_dacat> Allright understood no earthling allowed
[2:00:17] <%Garthunox> Loyalty missions
[2:00:18] <seancbo> Zaeed is kinda sick
[2:00:18] <olaksi> you can do it pat
[2:00:19] <%Ranryu692> nah, loyalty missions dont count
[2:00:19] <pth88> Ash solod saren in my insanity run while I was sniping the geth that drop down
[2:00:20] <Lamokmok> I mean, they're required in some missions in 2 and 3
[2:00:20] <tranquilturnip> Maybe the guy in 3
[2:00:21] <%Robot_Nixon_> Kaiden who??
[2:00:22] <Grandnatics> I can't remember if Ash or Kaiden get ANY special dialogue
[2:00:23] <$Faustgesicht> Besides the mandatory stuff is ME@
[2:00:23] <%Varlinator> I mean, it makes sense for the ending
[2:00:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> There are no loyalty missions for them in this one.
[2:00:24] <%peanutdot007> ME2 humans can be fun
[2:00:24] <CloudCircus> Tr-ash
[2:00:24] <%QueequegTheater> Vega is peak himbo hours
[2:00:25] <%BigCoffee> The nuke probe mission is perfect for 3 humans
[2:00:25] <Dfreddy8> Miranda?
[2:00:26] <+bassoontyphoon> Ashley in soon to be ashsquad
[2:00:26] <thelonechris> I don't think you're getting up there
[2:00:27] <+alphonseisbest> JAMES
[2:00:28] <+InternetShis> Jack can do the big biotic barrier
[2:00:28] <Ipsenscastle> Kasumi is fun
[2:00:28] <jbrowning134> Wow looks like a great game
[2:00:29] <+alphonseisbest> VEGA
[2:00:30] <Alzero83> Its not working Pat.....go around
[2:00:30] <Burger_Bonanza> Who says your human teammates need to be loyal?
[2:00:31] <SaphronBlackbourne> I like Jack, Zaeed, Kasumi, and James
[2:00:31] <+flexin_apex> I lost count how many pics I took of these beautiful stars like the bright blue one
[2:00:32] <+liquidzr0> adumWat
[2:00:32] <ハクア> jack is an okay character but she sucks ass in combat
[2:00:32] <%dave323dave> Vega has his moments but i never bring him
[2:00:34] <RrenKrieg> holy fuck this cliff
[2:00:34] <jackelzxaa> jack and kasumi are good
[2:00:35] <%AzureGale> WHAT'S-HER-FACE
[2:00:36] <tomahank18> Jacob straight up sucks, except when he cheats on you and leaves you as femshep. That’s dope
[2:00:36] <%SkyfireHero> I normally bring Kaiden for any mission that has to do with fucked up biotic
[2:00:37] <T_Sasquatch> jack kasumi
[2:00:40] <%AzureGale> THE UGLY ONE
[2:00:40] <%twistedj3ster> boost BEFORE the apex
[2:00:41] <%zyberion626> James really grew on me
[2:00:42] <DatAsuna> James is great
[2:00:43] <jackelzxaa> if you bring jack on miranda's loyalty mission she sasses her
[2:00:44] <+D00msDayDan> do jacob's loyalty mission but leave him on the normandy
[2:00:46] <Shade075> A thing I found really weird is that according to the math in the codex, modern day nukes are actually more powerful than godamn Reaper beams, albiet a lot slower.
[2:00:46] <+Soliloquy123> I kinda  like Jack, Kasumi and Vega
[2:00:47] <AmericanaRed> WHY DID WE TAKE THE CAR ????? sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[2:00:48] <ChaosedStar> Kasumi n Jack are best humans that you can take with you.
[2:00:48] <Grandnatics> JUST GO AROUND
[2:00:52] <ChaosedStar> I like Kelly too
[2:00:56] <+InternetShis> Zaeed, Kasumi, and Jack are the only cool humans
[2:00:56] <TourettesPlays> Zaeed + Miranda is one of the best squad combos in the game
[2:00:56] <moonmeh> zaeed is cool
[2:00:58] <Valkryna> LUL
[2:00:58] <James_Quivers> Zaeed is Australian tho, that's barely human
[2:01:02] <seancbo> The only good thing about James is that he's voiced by Freddy Prince Jr and you can pretend you're in Space Scooby Doo
[2:01:03] <%dekkitout> GOTEEM
[2:01:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> gottem

[2:01:06] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:01:06] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Vega grew on me when I sent him to hack a terminal and he started kicking it
[2:01:06] <%snow_bush> I took Zaeed everywhere, he's great
[2:01:07] <seancbo> Oh yeah, Kasumi is dope
[2:01:07] <+InternetShis> I CAN'T IT'S TOO HUGE
[2:01:07] <dalish2k> :o

[2:01:10] <+yoshkosh20> PAT SUCCEEDS THROUGH THE POWER OF SPITE.
[2:01:11] <+RoeDeerRootie> lmao
[2:01:12] <SaltyAzteca> DO A CHRIST AIR

[2:01:15] <BerryliciousDefinition> Gottem
[2:01:17] <Dfreddy8> Miranda has Warp and Overlord.
[2:01:17] <radioamnesiac> i am ashamed at how hard i laughed at "go around this dick"
[2:01:18] <AmericanaRed> EVERBODY INSIDE 🤮
[2:01:18] <%jillpilled> The Mako goes THROUGH shit not around fuck your mountain
[2:01:22] <%AzureGale> It's too hard to go around Pat's dick
[2:01:23] <stantheman_97> i always keep my team varied in rpgs
[2:01:26] <Lamokmok> Mako's true power
[2:01:27] <%QueequegTheater> THE BACK DOWNS
[2:01:29] <%POUND_CAKE94> Omg
[2:01:30] <%Garthunox> take kasumi on some missions, you said you never used her back in the day so it could be cool to hear your takes on her perspective
[2:01:31] <RetributionP> it's not a large detour
[2:01:32] <%toolofparanoia> JACK IS BASED
[2:01:32] <Sp3ctre48> Jack is great
[2:01:33] <James_Quivers> Jack gets SIGNIFICANTLY better in 3
[2:01:33] <seancbo> Jacob sucks for sure
[2:01:33] <dd44dostivei> james is cool because he's the GOW fan proxy and he's dumb as shit
[2:01:34] <stantheman_97> i hate jack
[2:01:37] <Ipsenscastle> I hate Jack
[2:01:37] <TourettesPlays> Miranda has a perk that lets her increase squad weapon damage she's the best Human squad member in any of the games
[2:01:37] <+DrSmashy> jacob? who?
[2:01:38] <tranquilturnip> I find it impossible to feel anything towards jacob
[2:01:38] <%dave323dave> jacob is too boring to hate
[2:01:39] <ape_hawk> why do you hate jacob?
[2:01:40] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Hating Jacob is very valid
[2:01:41] <%valriot> Squad combos are kinda just, covering a shield in ME1 and 2, but in 3 its real good, the combo stuff is rad
[2:01:43] <thetunnelhomer> Jack is the best romance, and Jacob is the worst.
[2:01:46] <%NocturneNovember> Jacob is even more drywall than KAidan
[2:01:46] <%Mekhet09> I had to google kaiden's name because I wasn't sure if it was acutally karth.
[2:01:46] <jellssssss20> Do you hate Kasumi and Zaeed too?
[2:01:46] <Sunstalker> I don't care if he kicks a computer to hack it, I don't want to see space new jersey in my game
[2:01:47] <+alphonseisbest> JACK IS GREAT IN 3
[2:01:47] <Alzero83> You hate Jacob?
[2:01:47] <yourliteraldog> The Expanse actually goes into great detail why it is super fucking illegal and often deadly to make modifications to a ships ID transponder. When each ship is a nuke it behooves everyone to know where everyone else is.
[2:01:47] <%YakumoYomi> I don't like her hair in 3
[2:01:48] <jackelzxaa> jack's romance in me2 is the best content she has in the game, and me3 is basically the entire game is paragon jack and it's the best
[2:01:49] <T_Sasquatch> Thats fair. jack is a real edgelord
[2:01:49] <%AFellowDegen> Miranda is the strongest companion in 2 I think
[2:01:51] <$lotharrio> Man, remember how quickly Jacob cheats on you if you romance him?
[2:01:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> jacob is a sleeze ball
[2:01:52] <+Soliloquy123> I was very surprised to actually really like Vega
[2:01:53] <%zyberion626> jacob is just the worst
[2:01:53] <ChaosedStar> the only hatable thing about Jack is that she only likes dick.
[2:01:53] <olaksi> romancing jack sounds ... uncomfortable
[2:01:54] <%QueequegTheater> @ape_hawk he cheats on FemShep dude
[2:01:55] <jackelzxaa> well she's not in the entire game but still
[2:01:55] <%NateyBeak> yea isnt she wearing like nothing but 2 belts in 2?
[2:01:55] <Broken_Sonex> And Miranda?
[2:01:56] <%Ranryu692> you were asking yesterday what Jacob's personality was LUL how can you hate him?
[2:01:57] <%lockhead45> jack is best girl if you do the paragon run with her
[2:01:57] <+InternetShis> Jacob basically cheats on you if you romance him in 2 and you get to slap him in the Citadel DLC
[2:01:59] <+alphonseisbest> JACOB CAN PISS OFF
[2:02:01] <Sp3ctre48> Jacob is fucking awful though and his romance in 3 is actually insulting
[2:02:03] <RrenKrieg> Jacob is Alenko but boringer
[2:02:03] <Hanzmolman> What about Miranda’s assets
[2:02:04] <Lamokmok> Jacob sucks
[2:02:07] <dd44dostivei> jacob is a sex object
[2:02:07] <%POUND_CAKE94> Vega came around for me too
[2:02:09] <+Rebellious_gate> Tali + Krogan is best party. You won't change my mind
[2:02:12] <Ipsenscastle> Jacob and Miranda and Ashley and Kaiden are too boring to inspire real hatred in me
[2:02:13] <%toolofparanoia> JACK GETS GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
[2:02:13] <SaltyAzteca> You mean her assets arent enough
[2:02:14] <$Futurecity10> Miranda + Kasumi destroys on insanity
[2:02:14] <peachy996> Yeah Jack in 3 is one of the parts I liked but also I hate how you can't take her with
[2:02:15] <yourliteraldog> Miranda sucks ass
[2:02:16] <seancbo> Miranda is the strongest Ass in Mass Effect 2
[2:02:17] <Jolnir> Jacob is a fucking cunt
[2:02:19] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[2:02:20] <Shade075> LUL
[2:02:23] <+jjjdanny> LUL
[2:02:23] <Alzero83> thats Racist, Pat....

[2:02:25] <+InternetShis> Is she Aussie?
[2:02:25] <AmericanaRed> OI OI OI
[2:02:25] <James_Quivers> Perfect buck teeth
[2:02:27] <%zyberion626> there's a mod to punch Jacob even if you never romanced him
[2:02:28] <DatAsuna> Kasumi stalking jacob is funny
[2:02:30] <SaltyAzteca> Nailed it Kappa
[2:02:31] <jackelzxaa> if you take miranda to the final boss of me2 you get a really good scene with the illusive man that only happens for paragon ending
[2:02:32] <Grandnatics> "I think Cerberus would like this!"
[2:02:32] <$Futurecity10> Kasumi can literally teleport across the map
[2:02:33] <tomahank18> Doesn’t Jacob get some other woman pregnant lol
[2:02:34] <%craigb31> perfect
[2:02:35] <olaksi> it's crazy how little character development jacob has
[2:02:36] <peachy996> Miranda is a marginally better Ashley
[2:02:36] <Dfreddy8> Wrong colony Pat!!!
[2:02:37] <ape_hawk> "oi, does me bum look big in this suit??"
[2:02:37] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:02:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's still so weird that Jacob is in Cerberus at all.
[2:02:38] <+senfood> Jacob is...there?
[2:02:40] <%dekkitout> Digeridoo. Space dingo. Kangaroo
[2:02:41] <AmericanaRed> he ded
[2:02:41] <digaogrunge> ONE LESS
[2:02:43] <seancbo> I like Kasumi, she's really cool
[2:02:43] <%NocturneNovember> Miranda doesn't call anyone a cunt, 0/10 fake Australian
[2:02:44] <fritz_dacat> Pip Pip for the Space Queen
[2:02:46] <yourliteraldog> Human Companions are the worst becuase I can hang out with alien bros
[2:02:51] <+Punchasaur> Why would you defend a character who gets good later when you can characters who are radical now
[2:02:52] <Blank9> crikey me arse is absolutely bollocks
[2:02:54] <HeroToxiko> Jacob definitely cheats on femshep
[2:02:57] <+StoopKid241> The Cerberus lapdog. I love how Miranda acts like they were in the right with whatever ship bombing Tali accuses them of.
[2:02:58] <%peanutdot007> Still somehow better then Ashley
[2:02:58] <mikesumusprime> ME2 pro squad is Mordin and Miranda
[2:02:59] <KaiserMario> Tryin'a fuck at the 'Randa? Tryn'a fuck at me?!
[2:03:01] <%Mekhet09> I feel like kaiden would be fine if he just had something. I don't know why they made the humans boring or racist or both.
[2:03:02] <+InternetShis> "OI, SHEPA' OI'M A TEST CHUBE BEBEH"
[2:03:02] <DatAsuna> Also this reminds me of the one nomad convo in andromeda where peebee tries to NTR jaal with you and it gets really weird
[2:03:04] <seancbo> The only good thing about Jacob is his loyalty mission is kinda cool
[2:03:04] <jellssssss20> Jacobs loyalty mission is to kill his cult leader dad who just wanted a funtime village of fucks and nomen
[2:03:04] <%walternatorz> god damn it
[2:03:04] <SaphronBlackbourne> Miranda is... okay
[2:03:04] <Ipsenscastle> It's weird that Miranda is constantly going on about her perfectly engineered looks when her face looks so fucking weird
[2:03:06] <wasdsf> OY MISTA PRIME MINISTA!

[2:03:14] <Shade075> The best thing about Jacob is his hilariously terrible porno dialogue in his romance scene
[2:03:15] <Grandnatics> Is Miranda better than Ashley?
[2:03:16] <seancbo> I mean, it is a great bum
[2:03:16] <%QueequegTheater> cheer500 James Vega really grew on me when I sent him to hack a terminal and he just started kicking it like an asshole, I love him

[2:05:55] <%POUND_CAKE94> Pat’s favorite thing to do is see comments from the clearly stupid/ignorant and just farm them for content so he can feel good and make funnies. Big streamer win/win
[2:05:57] <Sunstalker> @Dakuu75 Well, if it's a comfort, the first hour was just shitting on david cage
[2:05:57] <%peanutdot007> To be fair anyone setting a trap for Shepard is in danger
[2:05:59] <%machshop> it goes vyooo
[2:06:04] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm sure their confused by our dumb fusion
[2:06:14] <yficaptions> shouldn't shots just obliterate everything

[2:06:51] <+InternetShis> To elect them
[2:06:52] <digaogrunge> Thats why we're here
[2:06:52] <Ipsenscastle> stupid people are people too Pat. Just dumber and worse.
[2:06:52] <FortuneEX> One Guy doing his job
[2:06:53] <%Jumpie8> yeah, that's why I watch the RE4 LP over and over again
[2:06:53] <Sunstalker> Is that why it's so good when you and paige are both on stream? because you get to blow up the other person?
[2:06:53] <%POUND_CAKE94> I KNOW I AM RIGHT because I’d do it to buddy
[2:06:55] <$Futurecity10> Someone has to watch your content Kappa

[2:07:59] <%Ranryu692> Paige bucks that trend
[2:08:03] <TourettesPlays> I sure did like game overthinker back in 2009
[2:08:03] <peachy996> This guy used to be a Human, in LE he's a Turian now because why would a human be leading other alien pirates against a human colony?
[2:08:04] <tomahank18> I’m glad to be here with you guys.
[2:08:05] <Ipsenscastle> I've watched you be ultra fucking dumb but I still believe after all these years you're secretly smart
[2:08:07] <SaltyAzteca> WE MEET
[2:08:14] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt my thought is ussally "This guy plays many games for many hours, he HAS to be good at them by now"
[2:08:15] <%AzureGale> Oh he's a turian now
[2:08:18] <+senfood> Honestly, my opinion of Pat's intellgence has gone up over the years. DON'T TELL HIM THAT.
[2:08:18] <%POUND_CAKE94> How many people expose you to THAT MUCH of their brain
[2:08:19] <seancbo> Oh hey! This guy used to accidentally be human and it made no sense LUL
[2:08:19] <jackelzxaa> this guy was a human originally which was lore innacurate
[2:08:21] <firewhiskeys> he was a human
[2:08:23] <%jillpilled> "I don't even know you"
[2:08:24] <%NocturneNovember> Was this guy supposed to be a Batarian?
[2:08:26] <%blutzwavedave> REMEMBER WHEN THIS WAS A HUMAN?
[2:08:32] <slix3431> George Takei?
[2:08:33] <%NocturneNovember> nvm
[2:08:33] <%BigCoffee> @AzureGale what was he before
[2:08:35] <nivlac_555> huh
[2:08:36] <no123450n> why give him a literal 3d picture of your face
[2:08:36] <%toolofparanoia> this guy wasn't a turian!
[2:08:40] <yourliteraldog> I think you are pretty smart, but also behave stupidly which is actually how the most intresting people are
[2:08:40] <%Varlinator> He used to be a human in the OG Mass Effect 1
[2:08:43] <Broken_Sonex> OH SHIT HE'S NOT HUMAN ANYMORE
[2:08:43] <KeystoneA2> Feel like Elanos should've been a Batarian tbh
[2:08:44] <%QueequegTheater> OH SHIT
[2:08:44] <%POUND_CAKE94> Ahhhhh that’s a good fix thanks for pointing it out
[2:08:45] <JetpackMcQuack> You’re cute :)
[2:08:49] <%kjsandwich> I got all of the mass effect games from Xbox Game Pass. Didn’t know the legendary edition was even coming out. Should I do the dumb thing and get the Legendary edition or should I be ok with what I got?

[2:11:25] <RubberFistFight> @seancbo PC version was always like that.
[2:11:25] <tomahank18> I have a theory that Shepard constant helmet wearing made his hair rub off
[2:11:26] <+pmtriox> hill sprint

[2:11:32] <%POUND_CAKE94> Sprint down this slope it’ll be tight

[2:12:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Imagine you see a glowly blue fucker and his alien girlfriends roll up on you over a hill
[2:12:21] <$RealThiele> some trouble
[2:12:22] <$lotharrio> Man, what a bad plan that guy had.
[2:12:26] <%Dakuu75> @Mekhet09 probably nothing would do it at this point. Other than just being comnpletely different character
[2:12:26] <Psyramics> yes
[2:12:29] <%Mekhet09> Yes
[2:12:31] <Psyramics> yes it absolutely was
[2:12:31] <%toolofparanoia> Biotics are OP
[2:12:32] <%chiluzza> barrier was busted as FUCK
[2:12:32] <+butteryfan_> I came across him in the mako and just cannoned him
[2:12:33] <%QueequegTheater> Yes it was
[2:12:34] <Shatterthought> barrier was always this busted, yes
[2:12:35] <%machshop> vanguard was always busted
[2:12:35] <+toastchi> yep
[2:12:35] <KeystoneA2> This part is always fun if you have a sniper with explosive rounds
[2:12:36] <Mattais88> yes
[2:12:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[2:12:37] <%jillpilled> mhm
[2:12:37] <+alphonseisbest> yes
[2:12:38] <%logoth_> Pat has an endgame character already
[2:12:38] <Solvari> It's maxed out
[2:12:43] <aiutare47> Your specialization gives you a bonus to barrier
[2:12:45] <$RealThiele> ME3 BIOTIC CHARGE
[2:12:45] <TheApeGatsby> Yeah defensive abilities in me1 just make you totally unkillable
[2:12:48] <%POUND_CAKE94> The concept of OP on enhances this stream
[2:12:48] <sendart> why were those dudes just setting around a spot a nuke was going to go off on
[2:12:48] <%Varlinator> Immunity DEFINATELY was gamebreaking
[2:12:49] <+athuramn> yes, you just didn't reach it as quickly in the first playthrough @tourettesplays
[2:12:49] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I wonder what this game looks like if you CE all the stats right away
[2:12:50] <%peanutdot007> You're like ten levels higher then you should be for this section
[2:12:50] <Grandnatics> Pat did you already go to the moon?
[2:12:51] <yourliteraldog> Warp and Statis makes explosion
[2:12:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Barriar, Throw, Lift, Warp Rotation
[2:12:54] <+pmtriox> biotics were always insane
[2:12:54] <%bread_assassin> I played through the game on Insanity, and boy howdy, Barrier was like the only reason I made it through.
[2:12:57] <yourliteraldog> Warp Explosion
[2:12:58] <thetunnelhomer> God I really wanna replay ME1, but I do not wanna buy the legendary edition
[2:12:59] <CrypticMochi> It is on normal after all
[2:13:04] <+athuramn> like this would be 3 playthroughs in
[2:13:05] <Shatterthought> the only way you die is if you take barrier/shield ignoring damage
[2:13:06] <+butteryfan_> biotics are the best
[2:13:07] <%dekkitout> Mo yamage
[2:13:13] <+pmtriox> you should up intimidate
[2:13:15] <+shinpete> Is it just me or is that the worst mission design ever? Nothing made sense
[2:13:18] <+butteryfan_> they make so much stuff super easy
[2:13:19] <+pmtriox> because fuck it why not
[2:13:24] <%AFellowDegen> spectre
[2:13:28] <Ipsenscastle> Lift is fun
[2:13:28] <peachy996> I'd suggest Lift if only for the final battle
[2:13:31] <sweatch0> is lift bad?
[2:13:36] <thetunnelhomer> Man Assault training sounds like the most violent shit ever
[2:13:50] <peachy996> Lift makes the Citadel battle a joke
[2:13:52] <yourliteraldog> Drone go boop
[2:13:53] <CrypticMochi> Better lift affects stronger enemies
[2:13:54] <%POUND_CAKE94> There’s a reason lift didn’t make a big comeback later
[2:13:54] <%Dakuu75> that helmet is pretty cool. noit a fan of the perfectly clear visor thoughh
[2:13:55] <peachy996> It's hilarious
[2:14:00] <Vantesla> With the Barrier specialization it regens 40 shields per sec. Also enhance by ones amp and armor if I recall. So ya Barrier is pretty strong.
[2:14:01] <Dfreddy8> Battlestar Galactica
[2:14:04] <%QueequegTheater> More lift
[2:14:07] <tomahank18> Fuck so pats pretty far in with those stats
[2:14:07] <%bread_assassin> I actually stunlocked Saren to death by alternating Lift and Stasis.
[2:14:10] <peachy996> Not the Saren battle mind you, the one with geth
[2:14:11] <Ipsenscastle> fuck stasis
[2:14:25] <%QueequegTheater> Master hacking
[2:14:31] <yourliteraldog> Dose she not have a drone in this game?
[2:14:34] <+TallPixels> didnt know the rule 34 characters had a game
[2:14:35] <+InternetShis> Expert
[2:14:36] <$Captainahab_37> yeah!
[2:14:38] <peachy996> I used to lift Geth off the Citadel and they just flew away
[2:14:39] <%machshop> uh oh better get mako
[2:14:42] <thetunnelhomer> Master of unlocking
[2:14:49] <ape_hawk> GIRLS GET IT DONE
[2:14:51] <$RealThiele> make uses the relay
[2:14:56] <Ipsenscastle> @bread_assassin last week Saren kindly locked himself for me and hung in mid air letting me shoot him forever
[2:14:56] <+Soliloquy123> Maaaan, Tali rules
[2:14:58] <%AFellowDegen> no
[2:15:03] <jorniev> GIRLS GET IT DONE
[2:15:04] <%POUND_CAKE94> Yeah lift for the final gauntlet not battle
[2:15:07] <battlexqueen> I remember killing saren with a grenade. not the grenade exploding, but the grenade hitting him in the face
[2:15:07] <$Captainahab_37> are the elevators still slow as shit
[2:15:15] <Vantesla> Stasis only good on Shepard if using Bastion Sub class. For ME 1. In ME3 it is really good on Liara
[2:15:18] <+pmtriox> remember this? remember when the journal entries actually tracked your quests and weren't just vague statements?
[2:15:26] <+InternetShis> I remember playing ME3 Expanded Galaxy and actually paying for choices made in ME1. It was crazy
[2:15:28] <ianabstract> @Captainahab_37 Yes but you can skip them
[2:15:37] <+pmtriox> both
[2:15:38] <$Futurecity10> 3
[2:15:39] <Shatterthought> @Captainahab_37 you get a prompt to skip the elevator once it's loaded
[2:15:41] <peachy996> Yeah @POUND_CAKE94 knows what I'm talking about
[2:15:44] <CloudCircus> I love the song on the galaxy map
[2:15:47] <+pmtriox> mostly 3
[2:15:47] <mikesumusprime> 3
[2:15:47] <%Ynkubus_> @battlexqueen * bonk *
[2:15:48] <Lamokmok> 3's the worst
[2:15:54] <%sporeian94> 3 is literally just fetch quests from convos you overhear
[2:15:55] <%dave323dave> im playing through 3 now and the journal sucks
[2:15:56] <dd44dostivei> journal in 3 is fucked
[2:16:04] <+pmtriox> 2 at least was straight forward with its side quests
[2:16:18] <+alphonseisbest> yes side quests in 3 suck ASS
[2:16:19] <peachy996> 3's quests will get you tired of hearing the Reaper Horn
[2:16:20] <jorniev> Does anyone hear that weird thing the music does where it sounds super creepy?
[2:16:21] <+pmtriox> from what i understand the remaster still doesn't fix it
[2:16:27] <Grandnatics> It definitely is
[2:16:29] <sweatch0> monke
[2:16:33] <peachy996> It's the monkey planet
[2:16:33] <+athuramn> it's "patation" isn't it?
[2:16:34] <Essixian> tomatoCrust Monke?
[2:16:37] <RedPlasticCup> monke
[2:16:38] <CloudCircus> 3 is pulp scifi trash
[2:16:38] <ToneBacas> go back to monke
[2:16:39] <Grandnatics> Monke planet
[2:16:39] <%jillpilled> return to monke
[2:16:40] <peachy996> Fuck this planet
[2:16:42] <+Faultlined> The lads
[2:16:42] <+butteryfan_> MONKEY
[2:16:43] <Ipsenscastle> It's crazy how 2's DLCs ran the gamut from 'best in series' to 'absolute trash'
[2:16:44] <Grandnatics> didn't go triple monke
[2:16:45] <%QueequegTheater> MONKE
[2:16:47] <%toolofparanoia> FIND THE SHIFTY SPACE COW
[2:16:48] <arkv01> return to monke
[2:16:53] <Lamokmok> Did Pat see the cows already?
[2:16:54] <+pmtriox> not just the monkey planet, the POISON monkey planet
[2:16:55] <ape_hawk> MONKE
[2:16:56] <+InternetShis> If you give info on Cerberus to the Alliance in 1, it makes a pre-Earth raid on Cerberus's ME2 station much easier, and that's a SIDEQUEST choice
[2:16:56] <%sporeian94> I think this might be the shifty cow planet if i recall
[2:16:58] <Vantesla> 3 was rushed in many aspects. It has the least exploring/intrigue outside of designated safe hubs...
[2:16:59] <KeystoneA2> @peachy996 "I wonder what's in this system. Lemme do a quick scan."  *HONK*
[2:17:00] <peachy996> Fuck how nice this planet looks. It's to trick you
[2:17:07] <LorcaNomad> i just got here what's that about monke?
[2:17:22] <+InternetShis> Time for MAX RENEGADE
[2:17:23] <ToneBacas> look at your team all souped up
[2:17:25] <+pmtriox> it is
[2:17:29] <peachy996> HONNNNK "Ah god lemme just reset the reaper placements and leave"
[2:17:33] <$Captainahab_37> monkey gases
[2:17:35] <Botman_R> Super big pollen planet.
[2:17:36] <%kujofire990> so....smash players?
[2:17:36] <%machshop> too much oxygen
[2:17:37] <%LordCorgi_> pat fucks reptile men
[2:17:40] <%sporeian94> That's literally just the definition of Florida
[2:17:41] <CloudCircus> @patstaresat why don’t you just bring a human team for fun?
[2:17:42] <%twistedj3ster> it still looks bad too
[2:17:42] <%dekkitout> How so?
[2:17:42] <%AFellowDegen> is this the polen planet?
[2:17:44] <+Punchasaur> Da bois and da monkes
[2:17:50] <ToneBacas> LUL
[2:17:51] <%QueequegTheater> Jesus that's a tight spread
[2:17:52] <%captain_thickthighs> so like normal earth in like50 years
[2:17:58] <CloudCircus> Why am I toxic?
[2:18:00] <%Agami23> britney spears is on it
[2:18:00] <+athuramn> that last one got it rough
[2:18:03] <thelonechris> That last guy got discombobulated
[2:18:07] <jackelzxaa> wait is this the monkey planet or is it the hint about cerberus planet
[2:18:10] <muXPerience> sometimes people forget that putting big gun on a vehicle also means that you can put big stabilizer and big optic
[2:18:10] <sio_pao2001> hi
[2:18:12] <Essixian> Not me I love poison
[2:18:13] <+pmtriox> mako is clearly superior
[2:18:18] <%jillpilled> That brrrt is somehow more satisfying than the OG gotta say
[2:18:21] <jackelzxaa> exogeni stuff planet looks similar to the monkey one but is slightly less blue
[2:18:25] <ToneBacas> oh no
[2:18:29] <peachy996> Wait Thorian Creepers?
[2:18:33] <peachy996> This isn't monke
[2:18:36] <Solvari> LUL brute forcing it
[2:18:37] <jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt do you think the mako shoulda stuck around?
[2:18:38] <Gans626> is it me why does everything seem all warped like video seems going extremely fast but sound is lagging?
[2:18:39] <Ipsenscastle> firing the cannon at footsoldiers feels exactly like flicking a bug
[2:18:44] <peachy996> Wait this isn't Eletania is it?
[2:18:46] <%dekkitout> Zerg that lock!
[2:18:52] <ToneBacas> it's not even a puzzle
[2:18:52] <Grandnatics> Colossus is the best ingame
[2:18:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> 8
[2:18:53] <AmuserName> BEST ARMOR
[2:18:54] <jackelzxaa> collossus is good armor
[2:18:54] <$RealThiele> brute smarts
[2:18:55] <Grandnatics> Nevermind
[2:18:55] <Dfreddy8> That's good armor
[2:18:55] <%POUND_CAKE94> Oh I like those sounds a lot. Haven’t seen mako stuff til this
[2:18:56] <+InternetShis> WORTH
[2:18:56] <+pmtriox> thats a hell of a boost
[2:18:57] <Grandnatics> Wrong one
[2:18:57] <ape_hawk> colossus 8
[2:18:58] <SaltyAzteca> BIG DEFENSE
[2:18:58] <thelonechris> I was expecting you to get permanently locked out like in Fallout
[2:18:58] <jackelzxaa> its the endgame shit
[2:18:58] <RubberFistFight> @Gans626 its you.
[2:18:59] <%dekkitout> Nice
[2:18:59] <%captain_thickthighs> giving us great soundboard parts here
[2:19:00] <KeystoneA2> You're gonna wanna put that on
[2:19:00] <Ipsenscastle> thats good armour
[2:19:01] <bigboy3d> play frogger to open box
[2:19:01] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Eletania is monke planet
[2:19:01] <$renegade_blade> colossus allaFox
[2:19:03] <%Mekhet09> Colosss is stupid good.
[2:19:04] <jackelzxaa> red pat
[2:19:05] <%sporeian94> best armor in the game
[2:19:05] <Grandnatics> YEAH I WAS RIGHT
[2:19:06] <sweatch0> ow
[2:19:06] <RaidenRising> nice
[2:19:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Slick
[2:19:07] <jackelzxaa> red like pat
[2:19:07] <+pmtriox> yeah that's 8
[2:19:09] <%POUND_CAKE94> Oooohhhh
[2:19:09] <peachy996> YEAH Finally a good armor
[2:19:11] <%Varlinator> BEST ARMOUR!
[2:19:12] <%jillpilled> That's HOT
[2:19:13] <%toolofparanoia> EDGE LORD THEME UNLOCKED
[2:19:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Makes your hips pop
[2:19:18] <jackelzxaa> best armor accessible in the game
[2:19:20] <digaogrunge> DOPE
[2:19:22] <Ipsenscastle> thats a hell of a lucky drop
[2:19:26] <+InternetShis> Classic black and red
[2:19:29] <+athuramn> I thought you couldn't get anything 8 on first playthrough
[2:19:30] <+pmtriox> now you have to be a renegade
[2:19:31] <RaidenRising> we edge lord now !
[2:19:32] <jackelzxaa> the unusable armors are better but theyre just not accessible without cheats or mods
[2:19:35] <Lamokmok> Stupid good
[2:19:35] <+Soliloquy123> This game's loot system is bunk
[2:19:36] <CrypticMochi> One of the best armor brands
[2:19:36] <KeystoneA2> Titan's good, but not as good as Collosus
[2:19:37] <jorniev> nice
[2:19:38] <+InternetShis> That actually looks way more modern
[2:19:40] <peachy996> Now you don't look like a chode with blinky lights
[2:19:51] <%POUND_CAKE94> You got some Woolie Luck(tm) on that one
[2:19:55] <Dfreddy8> ZEUS
[2:19:57] <+pmtriox> okay this bit always freaked me out
[2:20:04] <+InternetShis> Skyrim it
[2:20:05] <sweatch0> this isnt yo mama's armor
[2:20:06] <%AFellowDegen> jump then boost!
[2:20:10] <peachy996> OH THIS PLANET
[2:20:10] <%QueequegTheater> They should just give the Mako infinite boost and jump fuel
[2:20:14] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:20:14] <$Captainahab_37> couldn't you change the color of your shit in ME2 or am I crazy?
[2:20:15] <%Mekhet09> I thought the mako could fly.
[2:20:17] <Pookiedaexzile> I always wondered why future armor needs leds
[2:20:17] <thelonechris> I thought his ME2 looks was "being burnt horrifically via atmosphere reentry after getting his shit rocked"
[2:20:21] <peachy996> This is the planet I hated with the Mako!
[2:20:21] <%POUND_CAKE94> Yeah THIS PLANET
[2:20:23] <Pookiedaexzile> you'd think that'd be a hazard
[2:20:29] <jackelzxaa> imagine doing this without boosters
[2:20:29] <twoto858> so what's the consensus on the mako again?
[2:20:30] <SaltyAzteca> nailed it
[2:20:31] <Solvari> With the power of 1000 dovakhins
[2:20:34] <%dekkitout> High Hrothgar, here we come
[2:20:37] <Ipsenscastle> good luck getting out of here
[2:20:38] <+InternetShis> Hack the gold
[2:20:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> HACK THE GOLD
[2:20:41] <$realm_forge> God this planet sucked n the original
[2:20:42] <Grandnatics> Hack the earth
[2:20:42] <KeystoneA2> @Pookiedaexzile Yes but you couldn't put on different armor like in 1
[2:20:42] <$RealThiele> poop?
[2:20:43] <%POUND_CAKE94> psaBig
[2:20:44] <%QueequegTheater> That's how geology works, kiddos
[2:20:45] <%cvp5127> hack that rock
[2:20:47] <jorniev> why did they build levels like that?
[2:20:49] <+athuramn> look at that gold just sitting there
[2:20:51] <bigboy3d> The Mako was probably 90% of the Normandy's budget
[2:20:51] <MichelangeloStark> Man, future exploration tanks sure are durable and safe for passengers with those inertial dampeners!
[2:20:53] <%AFellowDegen> I missed all the random side planet stuff after one planet because the mako sucks ass
[2:21:08] <%QueequegTheater> @AFellowDegen how dare you
[2:21:19] <+athuramn> he's going around
[2:21:22] <$Captainahab_37> oh shit this sucks
[2:21:22] <peachy996> I knew there was a reason I hated this planet, It wasn't monke it was the assfuckkity terrain you trudge over with the Mako
[2:21:22] <thelonechris> That is a 90 degree angle
[2:21:26] <tomahank18> Do Shepard and the crew get paid for this shit? Like is Garrus getting paid
[2:21:27] <Hanzmolman> The game looks really good
[2:21:28] <%twistedj3ster> prolly
[2:21:28] <sweatch0> i can do this irl
[2:21:30] <SaltyAzteca> Wheres the fun in that tho
[2:21:31] <Grandnatics> doesn't going out of bounds send you to the start point?
[2:21:32] <%AncelDeLambert> you sure do visit a lot of planets with heavy tectonic activity but minimal weathering
[2:21:33] <%sporeian94> Turn off Mako handling and climb those walls
[2:21:33] <%AFellowDegen> @QueequegTheater I HATE IT
[2:21:34] <%POUND_CAKE94> That makes the levels look like early procedural generation that was polished after
[2:21:36] <RedPlasticCup> yeah
[2:21:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Do it Pussy
[2:21:43] <%QueequegTheater> @AFellowDegen coward
[2:21:43] <jackelzxaa> it was way worse in the base game before you had boosters but this is the worst mountain planet in the entire game
[2:21:44] <+DeadlyPeaks> Skyrim it up
[2:21:44] <sweatch0> WOO
[2:21:45] <$Captainahab_37> game of the fuckin year baby
[2:21:45] <%POUND_CAKE94> Tru
[2:21:47] <$RealThiele> genius kojumbo
[2:21:50] <Pookiedaexzile> yeyeyeyeyeyeye
[2:21:50] <jackelzxaa> its so much easier now lol
[2:21:53] <thelonechris> Is this how tanks work?
[2:21:54] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[2:21:54] <%byuniart> Fuck this mountain too
[2:21:56] <%dekkitout> All terrain, bitchez
[2:21:57] <%byuniart> LET'S GOOOO
[2:21:57] <MichelangeloStark> @thelonechris This, students, is what we call a "RIGHT" angle /s
[2:21:58] <jackelzxaa> that woulda taken so much longer on the old game
[2:22:06] <%RaziWraith> Commander Shepard's Pro Mako LUL
[2:22:08] <%MelBrooksKA> Saw that too
[2:22:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Someone play Death stranding music
[2:22:10] <KeystoneA2> @PatStaresAt Imagine doing this planet without boosters.
[2:22:15] <%jillpilled> The old Mako would've flipped a thousand times and blown up by now
[2:22:16] <jackelzxaa> hey wrex lets go off ramps in the mako
[2:22:20] <peachy996> Yeah these are bad memories with the mako lol
[2:22:22] <%QueequegTheater> @RaziWraith unironic Day 1 purchase
[2:22:25] <%twistedj3ster> why do we even have this planet
[2:22:33] <%POUND_CAKE94> Lol who turned on CHVRCHES????
[2:22:34] <jackelzxaa> i can't believe all it took to make the mako fun was to make it heavy and add a boost button
[2:22:34] <%AFellowDegen> @QueequegTheater ok, half the issue was that yo are forced to be in for half the story missions also, and  then most planets are a rocky mess so there are no shortcuts
[2:22:36] <Vantesla> Predator X armor beats Colossus armor in Shields and tech/biotic resist. In pure damage reduction Colossus is the best though. Personally like Predator X because of camo like look.
[2:22:39] <jackelzxaa> and make it so it can shoot down
[2:22:45] <Solvari> Just ride this across a Reaper to destroy it
[2:22:46] <%psidefx> Sarge would be proud of that jump
[2:22:48] <+athuramn> BUT NOT THROUGH?
[2:22:49] <+InternetShis> Who bets he kills a few monkeys
[2:22:55] <+DeadlyPeaks> I’ll take Mako over probe any day
[2:23:00] <peachy996> I can see it
[2:23:00] <$realm_forge> Here I am doing eeeeeverything I can 🎶
[2:23:01] <%QueequegTheater> @AFellowDegen the shortcut is going straight up an 80 degree incline
[2:23:04] <+BIumen> i didnt know the game let you play in rural pennsylvania
[2:23:05] <thelonechris> Asylums for the feeling
[2:23:07] <CrypticMochi> Also not instant dying to lava

[2:23:12] <RedPlasticCup> this isn't the monkey planet
[2:23:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Keep on Keepin On
[2:23:17] <%QueequegTheater> The Chad Mako vs. the Virgin Warthog
[2:23:20] <%POUND_CAKE94> The shade of green is just right
[2:23:21] <Psyramics> Death Stranding has a very primordial look to it, and this is a primordial planet
[2:23:23] <%dekkitout> You played perfectly
[2:23:27] <%Piemen99> He was?
[2:23:28] <%MelBrooksKA> No
[2:23:28] <$Captainahab_37> this is the clown world
[2:23:31] <+RoByte2> What, you want a skin for the Mako that promotes Ride with Norman Reedus?
[2:23:32] <+kawachipto> Death stranding was the most fun boring game ever
[2:23:33] <+athuramn> nailed if
[2:23:33] <fritz_dacat> ..Oh yeah you played it perfetly the exact quote
[2:23:34] <Profmcstevie> ....did you dream that
[2:23:35] <%MelBrooksKA> Didn't even know that was a thing
[2:23:36] <thelonechris> This tank should be on Ride with Norman Reedus
[2:23:37] <+pmtriox> you want a secret with the mako? you have more traction in reverse than going forward
[2:23:39] <ammobasket> it's like you're on Ride
[2:23:40] <jorniev> Fuck off the warthog is better
[2:23:40] <Ner234> The hell is this driving LUL ?
[2:23:40] <peachy996> @Blumen well done
[2:23:43] <T_Sasquatch> Its almost impressive how empty and large thses planets are
[2:23:43] <%AFellowDegen> @QueequegTheater and then you get suck in a hole surrounded by rocks
[2:23:46] <digaogrunge> There was a vote?
[2:23:46] <$realm_forge> Pat won by a single vote
[2:23:46] <%sporeian94> I like how that composer was like "Pat is the perfect death stranding player" and then he went over to Woolie's channel and went oh no
[2:23:47] <JetpackMcQuack> we don't need roads
[2:23:48] <$Captainahab_37> death Stranding is Elite Dangerous on foot
[2:23:55] <%JamesCorck> Holyshit.

[2:24:09] <Pookiedaexzile> That's not a good sign for the game
[2:24:10] <%Ranryu692> did you ask him if Kojima knows you exist?
[2:24:11] <%Taisuru> LUL
[2:24:13] <Grandnatics> Is Death Stranding just an OCD game then?
[2:24:14] <%twistedj3ster> even that time you dropped everythng and then the car blew you up?
[2:24:15] <%POUND_CAKE94> That’s who it wasssss Ludwig
[2:24:15] <%JamesCorck> You were crazy enough to get into Kojima's mind.
[2:24:17] <T_Sasquatch> death stranding came and went LUL
[2:24:18] <%mikeriffic> omg it is Elite dangerous on foot
[2:24:19] <ammobasket> True
[2:24:19] <%walternatorz> Pat "Perfect" Boivin
[2:24:20] <%QueequegTheater> Pat it's Kojima, perfect does not mean good
[2:24:21] <+CursedNobleman> Pat Egos At
[2:24:25] <Ranger747> slingshot across america
[2:24:26] <%POUND_CAKE94> Yes it is a OCD game
[2:24:27] <%TheWinged7> congrats pat, your FINALLY perfect at something Kappa
[2:24:28] <%psidefx> The game was made for Pat
[2:24:29] <fritz_dacat> 2020 Pat was Perfect'
[2:24:29] <peachy996> So outside of the Story it was a game for Pat
[2:24:31] <%POUND_CAKE94> Sometimes
[2:24:31] <KaiserMario> I remember praising you too, but nobody cares what I think...
[2:24:33] <+D00msDayDan> it's true i was there
[2:24:34] <%SaiyanShoto> To be fair they didn’t see us non streamers play it so we could’ve been playing it more perfect
[2:24:34] <+GamerWorlock> I just remember you constantly mumbling about reconnecting america
[2:24:34] <+polothegreatest> you mean the ladder bit
[2:24:36] <jorniev> KOJIMA SAID THIS MAN WAS A GENIOUS
[2:24:37] <tranquilturnip> @mikeriffic oh NO LUL
[2:24:37] <%TheLakinessMonster> Remember you talking about it in the podcast.
[2:24:40] <thelonechris> I remember when people started to park their bikes on the highway for the sake of being a dick
[2:24:44] <Valkryna> LUL
[2:24:47] <%POUND_CAKE94> Saying it was made for Pat is a better way to put it
[2:24:47] <%sporeian94> Yeah but have you meet Kojima pat?
[2:24:48] <%Garthunox> @T_Sasquatch good, it was a great game, didnt need live service or dlc
[2:24:50] <+pmtriox> so they just got rid of the hazardous environment meter huh?
[2:24:53] <Ranger747> sasuga

[2:25:23] <twoto858> oh it's the best hands down
[2:25:25] <jackelzxaa> Pat have you talked about your feelings on the changes to the mako?
[2:25:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Kojima really knows how to make a game for people  with OCD
[2:25:35] <jackelzxaa> god look at this mako cheat code
[2:25:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Large Chungus Man
[2:25:38] <%peanutdot007> The memes Snake!
[2:25:39] <jackelzxaa> i'm so upset /s
[2:25:39] <$realm_forge> Kojima himself was rendered speechless by Pat’s raw masculine energy as he tumbled off that cliff in that one truck
[2:25:40] <Ner234> That's not how driving works wtf LUL
[2:25:41] <$Captainahab_37> this is a good planet
[2:25:41] <peachy996> Come on, climb the mountains you big magnificent bitch!
[2:25:41] <jorniev> ITS FACTUALLY THE BEST
[2:25:44] <%QueequegTheater> Look at this absolute fucking unit of a vehicle

[2:28:45] <$RealThiele> prancing creeper
[2:28:55] <+evbites> @bigboy3d normal
[2:29:02] <SaltyAzteca> Mass Effect, The Flood edition
[2:29:12] <+Punchasaur> You might as well be mousing over those guys and deleting them with a debug tool
[2:29:13] <%POUND_CAKE94> Man Kirrahe is so cool I’m ready for his slimy self
[2:29:14] <peachy996> @Captainahab_37 Thank you for the horrifying image
[2:29:15] <jackelzxaa> veteran isn't that much harder than normal
[2:29:23] <%QueequegTheater> ME3 gets fun on higher difficulty
[2:29:25] <Profmcstevie> If it doesn't become a better game on a higher difficulty, fuck it
[2:29:26] <+pmtriox> 3 is super easy
[2:29:26] <jackelzxaa> i usually do veteran for 1, hardcore for 2, and insanity for 3
[2:29:26] <+SlagChambers> ME2 on Insanity is a cluster fuck
[2:29:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Hard and Insane in ME2 are fun
[2:29:27] <+InternetShis> Garrus carried me through Insanity
[2:29:28] <%valriot> 3 is good on Hardcore since its a real videogame
[2:29:28] <bigboy3d> The first one in particular, the combat is kinda ass
[2:29:29] <$Captainahab_37> you don't want to beat Mass Effect on kiss your ass goodbye mode?
[2:29:29] <+abrupt_abe> 2 is pretty good at a higher difficulty
[2:29:31] <peachy996> Same Kirrahe is the best
[2:29:35] <jackelzxaa> oh this lady's a total bitch
[2:29:36] <jorniev> future wars are gonna be fucked, there is not gonna be ennought plastic bags to pick up all the casualties
[2:29:37] <%twistedj3ster> QUICK, KILL THEM!
[2:29:37] <+CursedNobleman> im ready to lose a jerkbag crewmember!
[2:29:39] <Pookiedaexzile> but I'm bias they came out whe nI was a kid

[2:29:48] <Lamokmok> Exogeni?!
[2:29:49] <ape_hawk> THATS NOT WHAT YOU SAID
[2:29:56] <%Daxalog> Why are you armed!?
[2:30:06] <The_Dudde> i remember watching yiu eat a chicken sandwich and it looked so fucking good
[2:30:07] <%valriot> "Oh ayy we were tryin to make medigel into maple syrup"
[2:30:09] <$Captainahab_37> who's XO Jenny? does she know XO Presley?
[2:30:09] <+Alopekis> I'm playing through on Insanity. It really doesn't seem as hard as people made it out to be.
[2:30:20] <%AFellowDegen> woops
[2:30:21] <feralspidey> they straight up made "creepers"
[2:30:22] <$RealThiele> LUL oops you caught us well heres a pile of warcrimes
[2:30:23] <+InternetShis> So you have a slave plant. Cool, die now
[2:30:25] <BlueLunecy> Imagine calling for help and getting the one guy that blew up your big experiment some planets over
[2:30:26] <stormhawk9891> CUZ THAT ALWAYS WORKS OUT
[2:30:28] <%NateyBeak> m...minecraft
[2:30:28] <Lamokmok> Like the geth, right Tali?
[2:30:29] <+senfood> creepers = freakers
[2:30:29] <RaidenRising> THE FREAKERS?
[2:30:31] <%POUND_CAKE94> Yeah these NPCs look better for sure. Human faces still kinda eh but wow the clothes and lighting
[2:30:39] <%mikeriffic> Insanity and harcore isnt bad at all actually fun with RPG elements, encouraging you to make number go up. For ME1 its really not bad, ME2 its rough at first but once you upgrade its fine......ME3...tho the combat is more fun, Insanity is a lot less fun. Just beat all 3 on it, ME1 was my fav to play on insanity. 3 best gameplay but hardest insanity
[2:30:41] <bigboy3d> @Alopekis IMO they're only hard at the beginning
[2:30:41] <CrypticMochi> I had to play on insanity b/c Commando Infiltrator and Bastion Adept are so busted
[2:30:45] <+Punchasaur> I DIDNT ORDER A CREEPER
[2:30:45] <%POUND_CAKE94> THE FREAKERS yes
[2:30:46] <$Captainahab_37> why do mass effect NPCs always look so afraid
[2:30:58] <$Captainahab_37> goddamn freakers
[2:31:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn Freakers getting into my Space Base thinking they can Freak it up

[2:33:23] <%Rumbutt> Sent them to the toughest jail of them all, hell
[2:33:26] <%peanutdot007> Killing them was so worth it
[2:33:27] <RedPlasticCup> jail
[2:33:27] <%POUND_CAKE94> If I was with her I’d bail super hard
[2:33:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat why did you opt to kill them all
[2:33:29] <Buiadaptive> AMAZING MISSION COMPLETE, THAT RIGHT THERE IS WHY YOU'RE THE BEST BOSS
[2:33:32] <hat_under_bread> I like how these dumbasses think they can take out an ultra elite special forces squad.

[2:33:36] <$Captainahab_37> laser jail

[2:33:40] <%jillpilled> You have an endgame character already LUL
[2:33:42] <%toolofparanoia> ENEMIES NEUTRALIZED WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE
[2:33:42] <+pmtriox> so you're pretty much god now
[2:33:42] <%Order_of_Mystery> SCOPED AND DROPPED
[2:33:42] <%BigCoffee> Why did you kill them?
[2:33:45] <olaksi> i don't think her bodyguards even did anything
[2:33:54] <Profmcstevie> didn't feel a thing
[2:33:59] <+samiscoolbro> I love this is so fucked up both renegade and paragon couldn't be bought off
[2:34:01] <%POUND_CAKE94> This is good stuff right here good stuff
[2:34:02] <digaogrunge> do they stack?
[2:34:05] <$Captainahab_37> they were commiting big war crimes
[2:34:05] <The_Dudde> kinda upset i never played this series
[2:34:06] <+polothegreatest> could you just take their money then "jail" them?
[2:34:09] <TioXyco> @olaksi they hid and got killed... that counts?
[2:34:12] <ChaosedStar> being a spectre is so cool lol
[2:34:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Did you get some gas for your space bike
[2:34:26] <Lamokmok> Wrex's brain lagging
[2:34:29] <+InternetShis> We saved the Thorian
[2:34:31] <%ospreyworks> does gief still bark at the screen when shep draws his gun?
[2:34:32] <%DJFakie> I did the same thing, the second the money came up, cos fuck them
[2:34:34] <%ForlornCarton> Teaching Garrus that killing people when you could arrest them is ok if they're bad.
[2:34:37] <%toolofparanoia> Bitch didn't want to go to jail... so... she chose death
[2:34:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> giant hero
[2:34:46] <%byuniart> Who is Pat romancing?
[2:34:50] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Thats not paragon at all...you killed Innocent people in that too....
[2:34:51] <%QueequegTheater> @samiscoolbro Renegade is less corrupt and more Dirty Harry
[2:34:52] <+emperri> they died when you shot them in the face
[2:34:56] <digaogrunge> BLOOD FOR BLOOD
[2:35:03] <James_Quivers> BLOOD FOR BLOOD
[2:35:04] <Dunmarkh> @byuniart Blussy
[2:35:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Blood for blood
[2:35:10] <jackelzxaa> How horrifying is it that guns in mass effect can just melt you into nothing instantly?
[2:35:13] <$Captainahab_37> proper police work is using excessive force when they spit on your honor
[2:35:20] <$Captainahab_37> with your laser shotgun
[2:35:35] <%QueequegTheater> @Captainahab_37 damn straight
[2:35:35] <%byuniart> hmmm Blussy, understandable
[2:35:44] <%toolofparanoia> if those mercs were smart they would have said nah man i quit... i aint with her
[2:35:45] <%DJFakie> They did declare hostile intent!
[2:35:47] <%QueequegTheater> Also, big murderers, so....
[2:35:50] <peachy996> that's the end of that
[2:35:51] <+katarjin> How goes the space game?
[2:35:58] <%captain_thickthighs> wouldnt killing the staff make it easier on the company?
[2:36:04] <%QueequegTheater> They active started shooting at you
[2:36:08] <$Captainahab_37> they did kill A LOT of people
[2:36:10] <Alzero83> Are you finishing 1 today @PatStaresAt ?
[2:36:10] <%POUND_CAKE94> Cut to the Woolie stream where they talk for 45 mins about how the ExoGeni employees behind her were still innocent
[2:36:13] <%QueequegTheater> That's called suicide by cop
[2:36:16] <+SinnerEbru> its both
[2:36:18] <%MelBrooksKA> @Captainahab_37 Just like my extra judicial space cop grand pappy woulda done
[2:36:18] <Minorou> mass effect is rad
[2:36:21] <+pmtriox> its because mass effect 1 is the best game
[2:36:21] <Pyon84> It is fun to watch you play it
[2:36:23] <%walternatorz> you enjoy games "perfectly"
[2:36:26] <James_Quivers> Hot take but the ME series is pretty great
[2:36:27] <%Wallabri> both!
[2:36:28] <+katarjin> ME still has a place in my heart....
[2:36:30] <+CursedNobleman> how soon is virmire! NotLikeThis
[2:36:31] <ape_hawk> you make most things watchable because of your inate insanity, patrick
[2:36:31] <%NCC1701Dave> And it is beautiful
[2:36:32] <Alzero83> actually...
[2:36:34] <Pookiedaexzile> I played the whole series before I turned 18,  this is like my childhood
[2:36:35] <%ForlornCarton> Your streams are great when you're having a good time.
[2:36:35] <%sporeian94> 1 is the actual shortest of the games pat
[2:36:36] <Alzero83> its not really
[2:36:40] <akitanito> do an endurance stream
[2:36:41] <%AFellowDegen> ME is so fricken good
[2:36:42] <Psyramics> no grinding offscreen here
[2:36:43] <+toastchi> When someone is enjoying what they are doing it is much more fun to watch.
[2:36:43] <$dalmek> it's that and it's been a long time since I've seen/played any of it
[2:36:44] <Alzero83> 20 Hours to do everything
[2:36:49] <+samiscoolbro> Well it is a good game
[2:36:51] <+katarjin> 3 was ok..ME A ..had good gameplay but nothing else\
[2:36:51] <%QueequegTheater> Pretty much
[2:36:52] <%toolofparanoia> Pat you didn't got to Noveria yet right?
[2:36:54] <peachy996> I love this series through better and worse
[2:36:54] <Pookiedaexzile> You wont
[2:36:56] <%Ranryu692> most of ME3 is quite enjoyable
[2:36:57] <+alphonseisbest> yea
[2:36:58] <cybz99> Mass Effect means a lot to me
[2:36:58] <+pmtriox> they changed dialogue in 2 btw
[2:36:59] <%Monkeyweed21> most of ME3 is good
[2:36:59] <$RealThiele> biotic chargeeeeeee
[2:37:01] <$hattrick61> me3 has the best gameplay
[2:37:02] <+SinnerEbru> i first played ME3 in 2015, it was alright!
[2:37:02] <$Captainahab_37> Are the parts you enjoy good enough to outweigh the garbage
[2:37:02] <%Agami23> this seems like the type of games i dont think i would ever play. but watching you play them is fun.
[2:37:03] <+DeadlyPeaks> Been waiting years for this LP
[2:37:06] <%Monkeyweed21> the bad parts are BAAAAD
[2:37:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> Nerd Squad best squad
[2:37:13] <+alphonseisbest> that's the ME3 way
[2:37:14] <%QueequegTheater> 90% of Mass Effect 3 is great
[2:37:14] <+ryujinran> mass effect 3 is great up until the last 5%
[2:37:15] <Lamokmok> Always felt that way for me
[2:37:15] <%MugenSandan> When will Pat romance Sovereign ;-;
[2:37:16] <%toolofparanoia> XENERD SQUAD
[2:37:16] <%POUND_CAKE94> I will be here to roast those parts with you
[2:37:18] <+pmtriox> ideas in ME3 were good, the game was not
[2:37:18] <Profmcstevie> I never had any interest in ME till it got the visual polish....also the ME3 stuff turned me off
[2:37:20] <Alzero83> It seemed longer back when because the loads times @PatStaresAt
[2:37:20] <%sporeian94> Just go in understanding after you beat the korgan arc in 3 the game gets pushed for time and after the quarian arc the game falls apart and the very end shits it's pants
[2:37:20] <%Order_of_Mystery> team ditigrade leg!
[2:37:20] <dd44dostivei> i always burnout halfway through 3. the worse writing is a big reason.
[2:37:21] <RedPlasticCup> did Pat do Bring Down The Sky yet?
[2:37:24] <+senfood> e're here for the upsetting parts. Expect your ME3 playthrough to have hundreds more viewers.
[2:37:25] <%QueequegTheater> But HOO BOY that other 10%
[2:37:30] <%AFellowDegen> ME3 feels like a game released recentley. the gameplay is so fricken good
[2:37:33] <jackelzxaa> me3 in LE is objectively a better game than the original because all the dlc work they did is just baked in for free now
[2:37:33] <Grandnatics> Not monke planet
[2:37:34] <$Captainahab_37> I never played anything outside the demo of 3
[2:37:36] <+Punchasaur> Liara is a nerd tho
[2:37:37] <James_Quivers> See, the ending of ME3 is indeed bad, but it isn't sooo bad that it destroys the entire setting, world and lore, so it's contained for the most part
[2:37:40] <%BigCoffee> @Profmcstevie its funny because it looks worst then before
[2:37:42] <$hattrick61> Honestly i love the weapon/weight system in 3 and wish they brought it to 2
[2:37:42] <peachy996> I look forward to dreading it
[2:37:44] <+Gregmeyer> do it right before virmirre
[2:37:44] <+butteryfan_> Bring Down The Sky is a great mission
[2:37:45] <feralspidey> The journey matters more than the end...
[2:37:45] <%sporeian94> literally just do it whenever i don't think there's a single check
[2:37:47] <dd44dostivei> have you ever done it?
[2:37:48] <Alzero83> Before Illos
[2:37:49] <+butteryfan_> Super fun
[2:37:51] <%toolofparanoia> FUCK YEAH LETS KILL BATARIANS!
[2:37:51] <%sporeian94> do it before virmire
[2:37:53] <%luckysteak> hey, there is foilage in this version
[2:37:54] <+butteryfan_> MAN FUCK VIRMIRE
[2:37:59] <%Garthunox> before noveria
[2:38:00] <+butteryfan_> ALL MY HOMIES HATE VIRMIRE
[2:38:00] <%sporeian94> do everything then virmie last into the endgame
[2:38:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> Bring Down the Sky isn't good but the Batarian dialogue is good.
[2:38:01] <+katarjin> @hattrick61 me too
[2:38:06] <%Garthunox> oh yeah virmire
[2:38:07] <%valriot> ME3 has some, questionable moments, but unless the more "finality" style where its not Star Trek and you are doing real bvig shit all the time bothers you, its overall a great game
[2:38:09] <jackelzxaa> theres a really good tali armor in bring down the sky
[2:38:10] <%Varlinator> After Noveria
[2:38:11] <peachy996> You can do it whenever
[2:38:13] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I prefer a good journey with a bad ending to the opposite
[2:38:17] <$hattrick61> Bring Ash so you can racist it up together
[2:38:17] <peachy996> Hell you could do it now
[2:38:18] <James_Quivers> Tin foilage everywhere
[2:38:21] <+katarjin> poor Batarians
[2:38:24] <%DJFakie> I wonder if the Fox News joke is still there
[2:38:24] <buhbuhboat> this planet is awful
[2:38:27] <%POUND_CAKE94> Dude his team is going to ASSAULT Virmire I’m here for ittttt
[2:38:31] <+SinnerEbru> man the mako looks so good
[2:38:32] <+pmtriox> its the WORST ending though
[2:38:35] <Shade075> LUL
[2:38:37] <+SinnerEbru> it looks so fun
[2:38:37] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[2:38:39] <%QueequegTheater> Then it wasn't bad sex
[2:38:39] <%dekkitout> He's right ya know
[2:38:40] <Alzero83> Impssible
[2:38:40] <%Ranryu692> the part that gets me is when Pat sideyes the chat to see if anyone got mad about his mispronunciation LUL
[2:38:41] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> ...
[2:38:43] <%sporeian94> I've never had sex so the analogy falls apart
[2:38:44] <James_Quivers> I've had that happen unironically
[2:38:44] <$Captainahab_37> what if you never feel your legs after that nut tho
[2:38:45] <akitanito> feel guilty
[2:38:45] <ape_hawk> did pat ever learn about dolphin pussies?
[2:38:46] <+pmtriox> no journey is worth getting your nuts kicked in
[2:38:49] <susukouhai> her Ass Effect is making ur Mass Erect
[2:38:51] <thetunnelhomer> I mean he's not wrong
[2:38:51] <%Monkeyweed21> why couldnt they just make these planets flatter?
[2:38:52] <deviljhojho_> this is the real mako experience
[2:38:54] <peachy996> Bring Down The Sky is basically a filler mission where it's okay to have filler.
[2:38:55] <DatAsuna> @pmtriox indigio prophecy is worse
[2:38:59] <+katarjin> @ape_hawk ,..whta
[2:39:00] <hat_under_bread> Well, that depends on it being good enough to get you to the point of nutting.
[2:39:02] <+trackles_64> they fixed the ending you chads
[2:39:03] <%twistedj3ster> I've had that, prefer journey
[2:39:07] <TioXyco> no elp
[2:39:08] <peachy996> But it's not bad filler y'know?
[2:39:08] <+SinnerEbru> no, die :3
[2:39:09] <Pookiedaexzile> People think the begining is better than it is.  The story is shit in 3 up to the end as well
[2:39:10] <Lamokmok> Ah, the almost vertical climbs were the best
[2:39:11] <Sp3ctre48> A bad ending can really ruin what comes before it for me
[2:39:11] <ChaosedStar> a great ending can like completely change your feelings towards something specially after the fact look at Code Geass
[2:39:11] <Ner234> Damnit Pat jsut drive around.
[2:39:12] <ape_hawk> look it up
[2:39:12] <akitanito> take a long detour
[2:39:14] <kulmoth> you truly are the mass effect
[2:39:15] <$RealThiele> Paaaaatuhhhhh
[2:39:15] <thetunnelhomer> Anyway, ME3's Original Endings are the actual worst. The extended cut is just dumb.
[2:39:16] <Pookiedaexzile> but dat gameplay
[2:39:17] <+samiscoolbro> I always liked doing noveria last it feels better paced like that
[2:39:17] <SaltyAzteca> Where is the grip
[2:39:18] <Alzero83> FailFish
[2:39:20] <James_Quivers> BDTS is the intro to the true scum that is the god damn BATARIANS
[2:39:25] <%QueequegTheater> DO NOT DRIVE AROUND
[2:39:25] <+katarjin> @ape_hawk i got so confused I could not type right
[2:39:25] <%shurtal> pat's havin' a hard time getting it up, lol
[2:39:27] <RedPlasticCup> don't you just LOVE the Mako???
[2:39:27] <%Taisuru> GO AROUND IDIOT
[2:39:28] <jackelzxaa> i am curious how pat feels about the LE version of the ending, since they did take alot of the criticisms to heart where they could,  half of giant bomb played after the dlc came out and liked thier me3 experience more than the half that played at launch
[2:39:28] <%QueequegTheater> DIG UP, STUPID
[2:39:29] <%strakillias> Thing is though you only have to play ME 3 to the end once. Every subsequent playthrough you can just end on the Citadel DLC and be happy.
[2:39:31] <+pmtriox> @DatAsuna indigo prophecy was awful from start to finish, its not the same level of awful
[2:39:32] <%PhysicsLB> i think i remember why i never play 1
[2:39:33] <Grandnatics> Yeah go around
[2:39:34] <%Monkeyweed21> this is why the Mako never came back
[2:39:34] <SaltyAzteca> Going the normal way is for CHUMPS
[2:39:36] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[2:39:38] <Alzero83> Get Fauked
[2:39:41] <peachy996> 3 has glaring problems in writing and it's not just the ending it's just the most well known
[2:39:42] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:39:44] <akitanito> I don't get how the mako has thrusters to help with landing but not for jump vertically
[2:39:44] <+trackles_64> this planet is so dark on screen
[2:39:47] <+SinnerEbru> YOU WERE SO CLOSE TO FLIPPING IT OVER aw
[2:39:48] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna It's still a way worse ending
[2:39:51] <+katarjin> I love the Mako...hate teh tank in 2
[2:39:53] <Ner234> NotLikeThis Pat
[2:39:54] <thetunnelhomer> I would rather the Mako than nothing
[2:39:58] <peachy996> But it has some good parts too
[2:40:03] <James_Quivers> This really makes you FEEL like Norman Reedus on his new show, Ride
[2:40:04] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah Mass Effect 3 has lots of problems other than the ending so it's not exactly a "It was good until the last ten minutes" thing
[2:40:06] <Ranger747> as bennet foddy talks about stuff
[2:40:11] <Shade075> Game of Thrones may be the wiorst ending since it killed all interest in the series, no one talks about it anymore
[2:40:12] <peachy996> The little Mako that could
[2:40:12] <Grandnatics> Yeyeyeyeye
[2:40:15] <+InternetShis> Imagine if they stuck to the Dark Energy storyline
[2:40:16] <%luckysteak> make your own switchbacks
[2:40:17] <Alzero83> Green = Traction @PatStaresAt
[2:40:17] <jackelzxaa> i wish this was still in the sequels
[2:40:19] <+trackles_64> green means traction
[2:40:21] <jackelzxaa> i love this stupid shit
[2:40:22] <%Taisuru> SO MUCH TIME SAVED
[2:40:22] <jackelzxaa> so much
[2:40:22] <Lamokmok> You're doing it!
[2:40:24] <akitanito> skyrimmmmmmm
[2:40:24] <%Kitafin> I think I can
[2:40:26] <%Deft_Thought> Praise the Green. The Green is good.
[2:40:31] <+trackles_64> Starbucks is canon
[2:40:32] <%POUND_CAKE94> You know what game is really good but has some really bad crap in it? FFX (mostly because of age)
[2:40:32] <$RealThiele> Getting over it with commander shepard
[2:40:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Game of what?
[2:40:40] <%BigCoffee> Lost too, no one talked about Losrt
[2:40:45] <+YawnSong_> GoT was always bad
[2:40:46] <DatAsuna> People still like the books
[2:40:46] <SaltyAzteca> Whats a Game of Thrones
[2:40:46] <jackelzxaa> god game of thrones really was just....it's painful beyond belief
[2:40:51] <%POUND_CAKE94> Correct
[2:40:52] <deviljhojho_> game of who
[2:40:52] <akitanito> people did a memory wipe for GoT
[2:40:53] <%mikeriffic> that cus GOT retroactivly ruined stuff in the past, ran back character development nad ugh
[2:40:54] <%Monkeyweed21> at least people still meme about the Attack on Titan ending
[2:40:55] <Broken_Sonex> Game of.....huh? What?
[2:40:55] <KaitlynnHere> Who what now?
[2:40:56] <Profmcstevie> 7 seasons....poof
[2:40:56] <stantheman_97> people still look at mass effect fondly
[2:40:56] <DatAsuna> Lost was awful for more than just the ending
[2:40:57] <thetunnelhomer> Those last books are NEVER EVER getting written.
[2:40:57] <jackelzxaa> it hurts to look at cast and crew photos of Game of Thrones characters
[2:40:58] <James_Quivers> Yeah, certain endings retroactively ruin previous things. For as bas as ME3 ending is, ti doesn't do that
[2:40:58] <%DianaTheAscian> It disappeared
[2:40:58] <%mikeriffic> no not going to talk about it
[2:40:58] <+senfood> You mean those books, right?
[2:40:59] <HeroToxiko> they ended it like they ended wolverine origins LUL
[2:40:59] <tomahank18> People talk about game of thrones alllllll the time though
[2:40:59] <dustworthmain> who?
[2:41:00] <$Captainahab_37> Game of Thrones was a War of Roses fanfiction
[2:41:03] <peachy996> That's true
[2:41:03] <%luckysteak> missed a crate
[2:41:04] <+polothegreatest> its was like a dream
[2:41:05] <Sp3ctre48> Mass Effect can be bad but I'll love ME3's multiplayer forever <3
[2:41:05] <deviljhojho_> man these suits were all so ugly
[2:41:06] <%mikeriffic> I can not relive
[2:41:06] <dd44dostivei> eh people watch lost sometimes
[2:41:07] <%AFellowDegen> @POUND_CAKE94 I agree completely
[2:41:07] <+pmtriox> @Sp3ctre48 100% dude
[2:41:07] <+EmptyMug> Are you ever going to watch GoT?
[2:41:08] <Alzero83> why is the hacking Diferent in the PC version
[2:41:08] <buhbuhboat> I got into GoT right before the final season and it really was the worst possible place to catch up to
[2:41:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Same with the Star Wars sequels
[2:41:09] <DatAsuna> Lost had multiple seasons of being trash
[2:41:10] <+trackles_64> Also battle star galactica
[2:41:12] <stantheman_97> nobody even talks about game of thrones
[2:41:14] <%toolofparanoia> MASS EFFECT WAS MY UPBRINGING I legit cried at how bad the ending of 3 was though
[2:41:14] <%QueequegTheater> Now jerk off on it
[2:41:17] <SaltyAzteca> SOMEONE MAKE A REFERENCE
[2:41:17] <KaitlynnHere> It’s a real shame they’d canceled that show before season 6 was aired
[2:41:18] <DatAsuna> Sherlock is one of the bigger ones TBH
[2:41:18] <tomahank18> Game of thrones is like a constant topic on Reddit lol
[2:41:19] <%mikeriffic> Imiss game of thrones...we deserved 11 seasons
[2:41:19] <%valriot> The fact youre even PLAYING mass effect again shows the ending is bad but 95% of the series fucks
[2:41:20] <%bread_assassin> Citadel DLC redeemed ME3, imo.
[2:41:22] <%mikeriffic> like HBO wanted
[2:41:23] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt GoT's ending was the kind of ending that invalidates literally everything that came before it. Like, it renders basically everything the characters did meaningless, and was so nonsensical that on rewatches you're forced to view it through that lens.
[2:41:23] <KeystoneA2> All the armor you find that isn't Colossus is garbage
[2:41:24] <ChaosedStar> Dexter has a similar effect just not as strong
[2:41:25] <%Monkeyweed21> people are going to be meming about the AOT ending for years to come
[2:41:28] <%mikeriffic> and GRRM wanted 14
[2:41:28] <+RAWPowerStudios> Where's the Dead Space marker?
[2:41:30] <Grandnatics> Missed a crate in the house?
[2:41:30] <$RealThiele> game of thrones also has GRRM looking like hes about to die if someone gives him another ham sandwich
[2:41:31] <%Rumbutt> Rumbutt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Really excited to see you eventually take French cyber zombie Pat Shephard through ME3
[2:41:31] <jackelzxaa> did pat find the planet with the sphere on it
[2:41:37] <DatAsuna> where it used to be one of the biggest and most annoying fandoms and then sherlock season 3 happened and everyone abandoned it
[2:41:38] <thetunnelhomer> Citadel DLC should have just been the whole game.
[2:41:39] <%Maids4lyfe> That makes me think, do you think the GoT ending will ruin future sales of the books? Assuming Martin ever finishes them before he dies.
[2:41:42] <%Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[2:41:45] <%barkon345> it was a mix of that atrocious ending and the fact that GRRM refuses to make the last two books
[2:41:46] <dd44dostivei> i dropped classes from being depressed by me3s ending
[2:41:49] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT YOU MISSED A CRATE
[2:41:54] <%luckysteak> is this the one that needs the consort's medallion?
[2:41:57] <+pmtriox> so they just dumped the some planets will kill you
[2:41:58] <Vantesla> Probably won't replace Colossus, unless a better Colossus or Predator X Medium Armor ironmouseKEK LUL
[2:41:59] <%QueequegTheater> Mass Effect's ending doesn't go out of its way to actively retcon good characters into being bad ones
[2:41:59] <Psyramics> @Maids4lyfe no, people will want to know if he fucks it up
[2:41:59] <digaogrunge> BIG BLIND
[2:42:00] <+trackles_64> in 2 the protean sphere becomes a coffee table object
[2:42:02] <Grandnatics> TWO
[2:42:04] <tomahank18> Book 6 will come out, 7 is ehhhhh
[2:42:07] <KaitlynnHere> @maids4lyfe no, if anything people are dying for those books because they want a real ending
[2:42:09] <Pookiedaexzile> You can also do a sick Jump off that Pyramid
[2:42:09] <+samiscoolbro> While me3 is bad it didnt butcher its whole cast like game of thrones did
[2:42:10] <Grandnatics> ONE OUTSIDE ONE INSID
[2:42:12] <+SinnerEbru> @Maids4lyfe nah, i think there'll be a whole wahoo when he finally does
[2:42:13] <+trackles_64> blind
[2:42:14] <$RealThiele> it had all the good stuff
[2:42:14] <thetunnelhomer> The Citadel DLC is kinda ruined by the fact that every minute that passes while you are doing fun stuff, like a billion people get killed.
[2:42:14] <digaogrunge> 2 CRATES
[2:42:18] <%Maids4lyfe> @Psyramics good point
[2:42:19] <akitanito> at least you haven't drove down the slope yet
[2:42:22] <RubberFistFight> @Maids4lyfe Martin's not finishing shit. Like, i think people need to come to terms with that. He'd rather fuck around with Elden ring and prequels than finish the books - largely because I think he DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO.
[2:42:36] <$RealThiele> brute smarts
[2:42:44] <+PenmanLupine> missed another one
[2:42:46] <Grandnatics> YOU MISSED ANOTHER CRATE
[2:42:47] <%QueequegTheater> Elden Ring isn't real
[2:42:53] <+Punchasaur> I remember the GoT Twitter account tweeted out "winter is coming" and Woolie clapped back with "no one cares"
[2:42:54] <Drunkengen> Cant you use Omni Gel to auto hack?
[2:42:55] <digaogrunge> INSIDE
[2:42:56] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah that's a good point @RubberFistFight
[2:43:00] <%Taisuru> Real talk, Game of Thrones books are kinda bad too
[2:43:00] <Pookiedaexzile> What is Game of ThroneS?
[2:43:00] <+pmtriox> @thetunnelhomer and that it doesn't change that the ending makes no sense
[2:43:02] <%luckysteak> inside the shack
[2:43:03] <Grandnatics> INSIDE
[2:43:04] <peachy996> People still talk about Mass effec as a whole 9 years after the release of 3 and 4 years after the release of Andromeda. ppl still love this franchise despite the lows
[2:43:05] <akitanito> he saw how it ended with the TV series
[2:43:06] <%dekkitout> Is GoT even real>
[2:43:07] <Zeif00> I just remember the entitlement takes from game journos whenever I remember ME3
[2:43:09] <tomahank18> Book 6 will come out. 7 probsbly won’t
[2:43:09] <Lamokmok> Lol
[2:43:10] <%JoshManVGH> But it sure is over
[2:43:11] <$RealThiele> agreed GRRM is coasting on his money living it up
[2:43:12] <%AFellowDegen> auto hack ALL the things
[2:43:12] <%QueequegTheater> @Drunkengen what if he needs it later
[2:43:13] <$Captainahab_37> That's okay that GoT won't end, the fantasy book I like will truly never end now so
[2:43:15] <tomahank18> The books being bad is a hot take
[2:43:17] <%Monkeyweed21> you will be lucky if you get 1 more book
[2:43:22] <%NateyBeak> gwass pwanet :3
[2:43:22] <ChaosedStar> Gimme a Mistborn Series or Movies
[2:43:23] <KaitlynnHere> You missed all the creates. Now you gotta go back to the beginning of the game @patstaresat
[2:43:23] <%barkon345> at this point most of his fan base has given up on him ever complementing book 6 so I think even if it comes out no one will buy it.
[2:43:28] <thetunnelhomer> @thetunnelhomer AND it actually made the Green Ending even worse.
[2:43:32] <hat_under_bread> This terrain material is almost good. Not that it matters too much because the planets are jank anyways, but it's bugging me.
[2:43:32] <tanarath> @patstaresat the author is also racist & anti trans, it sucks
[2:43:35] <RubberFistFight> @tomahank18 they're mediocre.
[2:43:38] <James_Quivers> I at least think the Fire And Blood TV adaptation has the potential to be good, because that book is actually FINISHED
[2:43:39] <+PenmanLupine> Game of Thrones is gonna go the way of Berserk
[2:43:39] <ammobasket> it will be a straight novelization of the final season
[2:43:40] <+pmtriox> people who talk about andromeda positively are insane
[2:43:40] <Alzero83> Is Paige a spider yet?
[2:43:41] <%G_Thunders> Lol yeah pessimism for no real season about a fictional series would be so helpful
[2:43:43] <Pookiedaexzile> What is That?
[2:43:43] <%POUND_CAKE94> It still has too much Big Brand Energy to ever truly “end” outside of the books
[2:43:52] <KaitlynnHere> No
[2:43:53] <tomahank18> Objectively weonn
[2:43:53] <SaltyAzteca> Ohhhhh Game of Thrones
[2:43:55] <tomahank18> Wrong
[2:43:56] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Book 6 ain't out yet.
[2:43:56] <thetunnelhomer> Ignore Game of Thrones. Get into the Cosmere.
[2:43:58] <akitanito> what if elden ring has no ending
[2:43:58] <RubberFistFight> it'd be book 5.
[2:43:59] <Sigma_190_Beta> OHHHHH ELDEN RING!
[2:44:01] <%Taisuru> @tomahank18 They start good but by the newest one they're straight up bad SHOCKING SWERVE writing
[2:44:01] <%JamesCorck> And then get sued by GRRM for writing fanfiction.
[2:44:02] <ChaosedStar> oooohhhhh the eldon ring
[2:44:03] <KaitlynnHere> They’re making a game?
[2:44:03] <BlueLunecy> What if Elden Ring really IS the end of GoT
[2:44:03] <Alzero83> Aria sailed to Elden Ring
[2:44:04] <Drunkengen> @QueequegTheater BUT WHAT IF THIS IS THE LATER
[2:44:04] <$RealThiele> Solaire busts in and resurrects Jon
[2:44:06] <Pookiedaexzile> If Book 6 is Elden Ring, that will be the rawest move ever
[2:44:06] <%Maids4lyfe> but when is elden ring coming out?
[2:44:06] <Grandnatics> What if they reference Season 8 in Elden Ring?
[2:44:08] <+InternetShis> Remember that there is a discontinued tablet game for Mass Effect, so half of Mass Effect is bad, YET IT IS STILL BELOVED.
[2:44:14] <+trackles_64> the fan fiction is just endless sex scenes  tho
[2:44:19] <%mikeriffic> book is takingsoooo long
[2:44:19] <+pmtriox> have any books come out since the show started?
[2:44:20] <thetunnelhomer> Brandon Sanderson is the one true Fantasy fiction man
[2:44:21] <Pookiedaexzile> What if tho,
[2:44:21] <%QueequegTheater> @Drunkengen what if he needs it later later
[2:44:22] <ammobasket> #ITBURNS
[2:44:23] <%dekkitout> Maybe book 6 were the friends we made along the way
[2:44:23] <+SinnerEbru> i wonder if GoT will only ever be "finished" thru a spiritual successor
[2:44:26] <%mikeriffic> if he made it before the show ended
[2:44:26] <%Agami23> dont worry guys, wheel of time is getting a series that will surely be good
[2:44:28] <akitanito> overkill
[2:44:28] <feralspidey> she said the thing
[2:44:29] <%mikeriffic> it might have been saved
[2:44:30] <olaksi> what if elden ring ends on a cliffhanger
[2:44:31] <Vantesla> Didn't Martin slightly recently try to take a few jabs at Tolkien work? Like he has any leg to stand on LUL
[2:44:32] <thewhiterice92> Here's what you should do for Game of Thrones, read One Piece
[2:44:34] <Drunkengen> THIS IS LATER
[2:44:37] <%mikeriffic> its been 8 years since the last one i think
[2:44:42] <+trackles_64> Elden Ring is literally book 6
[2:44:44] <Grandnatics> "How horrible!" BRRRRRT
[2:44:44] <$realm_forge> I prefer the South Park version of George rr Martin
[2:44:45] <ChaosedStar> @thetunnelhomer doodBro doodBro doodBro
[2:44:45] <%POUND_CAKE94> CANT WAIT FOR THE WHEEL OF TIME SERIES
[2:44:46] <%luckysteak> grant them peace through superior firepower
[2:44:48] <%bread_assassin> I don't think Book 6 of GOT is ever coming out. GRRM's riding the royalties from the show until he's dead/
[2:44:48] <tomahank18> 10
[2:44:52] <peachy996> And then Tywin Lannister holds the Moonlight Great Sword
[2:44:56] <peachy996> The End
[2:44:57] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Yeah remember when GRRM was like "if i don't finish it by this date then you can lock me in a room and force me to write it"? Well, it wasn't finished by that date, and he didn't get locked into a room to finish it. So... yeah.
[2:44:59] <%shurtal> Windows just crashed on me, but when i got back to desktop, mordin was the random wallpaper on my main monitor, so hey, great job windows
[2:45:00] <thetunnelhomer> I really hope the Wheel of Time TV series is good.
[2:45:00] <+InternetShis> Oh yeah that thing that's not real
[2:45:05] <godzookylives> 2 more books left
[2:45:05] <Pookiedaexzile> WHAT IF THO
[2:45:09] <akitanito> berserk is tied to dark souls
[2:45:11] <jackelzxaa> oh no is miyazaki cursed
[2:45:12] <Ner234> FeelsBadMan
[2:45:14] <RGBgamesinc> OH GOD WHEEL OF TIME
[2:45:15] <+trackles_64> Isobelle Car.ody is way worse with her sequels
[2:45:15] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Guts and Casca killed Griffith and moved to Catarina
[2:45:17] <iosephe> Berserk was in a good place
[2:45:18] <$Captainahab_37> I doubt wheel of time TV series will be good tbh
[2:45:19] <RGBgamesinc> i forgot
[2:45:20] <jackelzxaa> miakazaki should never make a one piece inspired game
[2:45:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Just remember, if you're dissapointed by the Game of Thrones ending you should read Attack in Titan, that will never end badly
[2:45:28] <+InternetShis> FUCK WHAT?
[2:45:30] <%AncelDeLambert> oh he's crazy
[2:45:32] <KaitlynnHere> @vantesla if saying gandalf should’ve stayed dead and that was what inspired him to kill off main characters than yea I guess that’s a jab
[2:45:33] <%Maids4lyfe> WHY
[2:45:34] <$RealThiele> oh jesus
[2:45:34] <James_Quivers> He will inherit THE CURSE
[2:45:36] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a DUMB thing to say
[2:45:37] <jackelzxaa> i hope miura had ALOT of notes
[2:45:39] <%Taisuru> Berserk will kill TWO authors
[2:45:40] <Oxybe> Oh no...
[2:45:40] <%shurtal> tha's a LOT of pressure
[2:45:41] <Profmcstevie> Not a mantle I'd want
[2:45:42] <%Maids4lyfe> HE'S GOING TO
[2:45:42] <RubberFistFight> Didn't Miura explicitly give his blessing for that to happen at least though/
[2:45:43] <stantheman_97> wait what
[2:45:43] <$Futurecity10> He most likely will
[2:45:44] <hat_under_bread> I feel like he would be lynched if it's not amazing.
[2:45:44] <%dekkitout> Dude- look. At. Getter. Godspeed to Berserk in all realness...
[2:45:46] <%AncelDeLambert> at least give it a few years before you even say that
[2:45:46] <+trackles_64> isobelle Carmodie  is way worse with her sequels
[2:45:46] <peachy996> Oh that poor guy
[2:45:47] <+polothegreatest> i hope aot anime have alternate ending
[2:45:47] <akitanito> even if he was following the script, he would still get blamed for it
[2:45:48] <thetunnelhomer> Oh, has there been any discussion on AoT's endings?
[2:45:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Why not
[2:45:49] <+InternetShis> Boat 2
[2:45:50] <+PenmanLupine> Did he actually say that? I heard that options were being considered but no one actually claimed to continue it
[2:45:50] <%jillpilled> I really hope he doesn't for his sanity sake
[2:45:51] <digaogrunge> Vaati will explain Elden Ring and it will be better than GoT
[2:45:53] <dd44dostivei> just give it a subtitle
[2:45:57] <$RealThiele> one run of good, then death
[2:45:58] <%peanutdot007> It's one of those things where I hope there's like five chapters left in Berserk if he's doing that
[2:46:01] <KaitlynnHere> Anime=death
[2:46:01] <James_Quivers> He should treat it as a side projects, take his time
[2:46:01] <%Agami23> dude i cant believe they are retconning the attack on titan ending.
[2:46:02] <+butteryfan_> That poor man, i hope he's gonna be okay
[2:46:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Even if he reproduces Miura's work perfectly people will still complain
[2:46:03] <thetunnelhomer> I got caught up with that and I felt like it was a waste of time
[2:46:03] <%za7az> What if they end up making it even better somehow?
[2:46:04] <%POUND_CAKE94> It’s at a solid spot right now tho no complaints if he backs off
[2:46:06] <Lamokmok> Jump, you trashcan on wheels!
[2:46:06] <%RetroCop87> Oh man, but think about the assistants who will inevitably be stuck with Hunter x Hunter
[2:46:07] <+trackles_64> it takes ages to write a book
[2:46:10] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It would be like trying to write Return of the King with just Tolkien's notes
[2:46:10] <+titansloth93> TBH I would accept some drop in art quality if the story gets a satisfying ending
[2:46:12] <+Punchasaur> At least elden ring wasn’t being written by Miura
[2:46:12] <RubberFistFight> hahahah shakesman. Fucken plinkett.
[2:46:14] <peachy996> He already inherits the "Miura wouldn't have done it that way" criticism
[2:46:14] <+YawnSong_> What if they nailed it though? How beautiful would that be?
[2:46:15] <%JamesCorck> o.O
[2:46:15] <stantheman_97> that's so much pressure
[2:46:21] <KaitlynnHere> ........
[2:46:24] <James_Quivers> Frank Herberts son did a good job with Dune, at least
[2:46:24] <%JamesCorck> Oooh I get it.
[2:46:26] <%valriot> Apparently Miura DID tell people how he wanted it to end, but if they were to do, he wouldnt do it alone, the Ippo guy would help at least
[2:46:27] <%peanutdot007> That did actually happen with Shakespeare (maybe) though
[2:46:29] <%dekkitout> Romeo x Hamlet ft. Macbeth
[2:46:31] <+HeyItsScubaSteve> Ah yes william shakesman
[2:46:32] <+SinnerEbru> romeo&hamlet sounds like some great, pre-copyright fanfiction shit
[2:46:32] <stantheman_97> shakesmens
[2:46:32] <%JamesCorck> I thought I was having a stroke there for a second.
[2:46:33] <ammobasket> pick up the 'speare where he dropped it
[2:46:34] <%QueequegTheater> RUN AWAY
[2:46:36] <Pookiedaexzile> What if Someone handed you a Todd Mcflarene Spiderman Page and said finish it
[2:46:39] <akitanito> they should just claim miura draw everything already
[2:46:39] <%QueequegTheater> COWARD HUSKS
[2:46:41] <dd44dostivei> romeo and hamlet might be problematic
[2:46:48] <+Punchasaur> I mean,Miura DID die under the pressure
[2:46:54] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:46:57] <RubberFistFight> @James_Quivers if by a "good job" you mean "molested its corpse like a frat boy in the coat room during a party" then yeah.
[2:46:58] <%RetroCop87> Oda has a literal safe full of the rest of the story for his assistants should he pass away
[2:46:59] <$RealThiele> happy pride month romeo and hamlet
[2:47:01] <KaitlynnHere> Are you trying to avoid copyright for Shakespeare by saying all those names wrong?
[2:47:03] <Shade075> LUL
[2:47:05] <%Maids4lyfe> He's going to commit suicide because of the pressure and the Antis on the internet harassing him until he dies
[2:47:05] <%Archphronimos> Mozart's Requiem was finished by his assistants after he died... although I think you're absolutely right regarding Berzerk
[2:47:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember that according to Miura, getting off the boat was like the 50 or 60% mark
[2:47:08] <ChaosedStar> The art pressure alone man
[2:47:08] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Tali is enjoying this murder
[2:47:08] <peachy996> @Pookiedaexzile Venom and Peter Parker would kiss
[2:47:12] <%barkon345> damn I just looked it up, its seriously been 10 years since A Dance With Dragons was released
[2:47:15] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt Have you seen the side manga that those Miura assistants have done, though? They've gotten exceptionally good at copying his style, so they're clearly committed
[2:47:16] <Oxybe> @patstaresat why u killing all the Skullomania
[2:47:18] <%POUND_CAKE94> If a bunch of mangaka do a tribute chapter that works it’d be hype and wholesome
[2:47:20] <RubberFistFight> @KaitlynnHere No, it's a redlettermedia/mister plinkett joke.
[2:47:25] <tomahank18> With japans declining birth rate, does that mean there’s gonna be way less anime in the future
[2:47:29] <+PenmanLupine> its been since 2011 since Dance of Dragons
[2:47:29] <+samiscoolbro> Did pat get explosive ammo yet?
[2:47:31] <%JamesCorck> Wasn't it like a decade?
[2:47:36] <%JamesCorck> Since the last book came out?
[2:47:41] <akitanito> it's that old huh
[2:47:41] <Pookiedaexzile> What is this game you keep talking about
[2:47:44] <KaitlynnHere> @rubberfistfight oh I see
[2:47:44] <%JamesCorck> The whole series came out between the last book and now.
[2:47:44] <solidgoldtoast> A Dance With Dragons came out 9 years ago
[2:47:45] <Pookiedaexzile> is it PS 1 era
[2:47:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Its not that old lol
[2:47:49] <+gksnipa> i wondef if king killer chronicles comr out with a new book
[2:47:50] <%AFellowDegen> ......
[2:47:50] <%RetroCop87> Did the Dark Tower series take longer to finish then Game of Thrones has gotten?
[2:47:53] <Grandnatics> NICE
[2:47:54] <+SinnerEbru> NICE
[2:47:54] <Vantesla> @punchasaur no he had poor health for decades. He did work hard for sure and especially under his condition. Still he had physical issues that shorten his life already sadly.
[2:47:56] <Hazerto> Just let Sanderson do it again I guess
[2:48:00] <BlueLunecy> What the fuck was that
[2:48:02] <%JamesCorck> The GoT Fandom is way too loyal, the IP doesn't deserve it.
[2:48:04] <thetunnelhomer> Dark Tower was pretty quiack.
[2:48:04] <tomahank18> GoT book one came out in 95
[2:48:04] <Grandnatics> some crates downstairs
[2:48:06] <stantheman_97> i didn't exist
[2:48:10] <%Maids4lyfe> @tomahank18 nah most animation studios outsource to Korea and China now
[2:48:11] <Oxybe> no mor Skullomanias...
[2:48:15] <zentzen> winds of winter has been announced since 2010
[2:48:17] <Grandnatics> Wait there was no info screen
[2:48:17] <$Captainahab_37> I hear the dark tower movie was not good
[2:48:20] <%QueequegTheater> I was two years old
[2:48:30] <RubberFistFight> @Captainahab_37 it was super not good.
[2:48:30] <%RetroCop87> The first Dark Tower book came out in the early 80's, no?
[2:48:30] <thetunnelhomer> I don't want Sanderson to finish GoT, I want Stormlight Archive 5-8
[2:48:33] <%Maids4lyfe> dark tower movie was bad
[2:48:35] <+SinnerEbru> @tomahank18 god i'm as old as the series... i'm about to go to grad school
[2:48:41] <thetunnelhomer> And like 18 generations of Mistborn
[2:48:42] <$RealThiele> dark tower movie tried to cram all the books into a 90 fucking minute movie it was a mess
[2:48:44] <%AncelDeLambert> ... these doors are STUPID
[2:48:45] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I'm still mad that Stephen King retconned Randall Flag being Nyarlathotep
[2:48:45] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat why is liara not on nerd squad? She’s an archaeologist.
[2:48:46] <hat_under_bread> Something about that door sound just screams 2007 to me.
[2:48:48] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater tiny pissbabby queeq :P
[2:48:53] <ToneBacas> Shepard. Wrex
[2:48:53] <Pookiedaexzile> In un related news Walking Dead is still going
[2:48:56] <$Captainahab_37> I just want a Blood Meridian TV show
[2:48:56] <+PenmanLupine> Sanderson said he would never finish Game of Thrones. It's not his kind of book series to write
[2:49:03] <tranquilturnip> get that nutrition
[2:49:04] <%DashXero> DashXero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I am enjoying the stream.
[2:49:06] <$Teh_Un> Wrex
[2:49:08] <%QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Adapt or die old man
[2:49:10] <Profmcstevie> Snack break, just vibe to the map music

[2:49:13] <rekinom> mukkbang time
[2:49:16] <%RetroCop87> a break break, or an end break?
[2:49:16] <%Ranryu692> do it dude, I wouldn't mind a break  to do something else without missing anything LUL
[2:49:17] <%barkon345> who is Sanderson?
[2:49:18] <thetunnelhomer> Walking Dead is an apt name of that series.
[2:49:20] <Alzero83> Just use DoorDash
[2:49:20] <peachy996> Take a food break before Geth Incursions, if you don't you'll be incredibly hungry
[2:49:20] <godzookylives> @PatStaresAt My parents read the books when they first came out and even my Dad gave up and looked at the TV ending
[2:49:22] <Alzero83> Your sponsor
[2:49:23] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater all that coke left holes in his brain.
[2:49:25] <%templar010> No subsist on game alone
[2:49:26] <+Punchasaur> @vantesla right but he still broke under the stress of it all
[2:49:31] <%QueequegTheater> @barkon345 Wheel of Time
[2:49:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Husk aren't Organic
[2:49:36] <%POUND_CAKE94> Cam off mic on super high ASMR interlude
[2:49:37] <RubberFistFight> @RetroCop87 a break like ross and rachel
[2:49:38] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> oh crap song of fire and ice did come out in 96 lolololol
[2:49:43] <Psyramics> dots are bad when you one or two shot everything
[2:49:44] <Grandnatics> Green > Red
[2:49:46] <%Ynkubus_> you should if you stream like yesterday
[2:49:48] <Dabrikishaw> Yo, Pat has Colluss
[2:49:51] <Alzero83> Use DoorDash so they can tamper with your food @PatStaresAt
[2:49:51] <Lamokmok> To put into perspective, the first book came out before Harry Potter's first book.
[2:49:54] <thetunnelhomer> @barkon345 Brandon Sanderson, Stormlight Archive, Mistborn. Best books in recent memory.
[2:49:59] <Dabrikishaw> I mean the best armor on
[2:50:00] <+InternetShis> Grass beats Fire
[2:50:01] <%luckysteak> bask in the warm glow of no ammo
[2:50:07] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY DO THEY HAVE SO MUCH MONEY
[2:50:12] <%POUND_CAKE94> Yeah he got that colossus drop earlier super dope
[2:50:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Garrus is the strongest squadmate in the series.
[2:50:23] <%DJFakie> That's Spectre grade weapons for you!
[2:50:25] <RubberFistFight> THEY INVESTED IN HUSKCOIN
[2:50:26] <%QueequegTheater> That is a statement that remains true for the entire series
[2:50:28] <olaksi> the one nice thing about GoT ending is that now a lot of people know appeal to foreshadowing is a logical fallacy
[2:50:29] <ChaosedStar> @barkon345 Fantasy author who finished the wheel of time series. Writes mistborn, stormlight and the skyward series
[2:50:30] <%templar010> Yeah money skaling gets loopy
[2:50:32] <Pookiedaexzile> The Geth just put them on the spike they don't loot them
[2:50:33] <$RealThiele> they are made of fancy metal
[2:50:35] <semachie> something somewhere just dies
[2:50:38] <%templar010> Scaling' rather
[2:50:38] <%Monkeyweed21> they had like 6K each LUL
[2:50:39] <%TheotherKristian> Mass effect 3 is almost as good as Mass Effect 2, until it is not
[2:50:41] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Have you ever tried a Sniper RIfle + explosive rounds build?
[2:50:44] <+butteryfan_> Why Garrus is the best pt 1 out of 35
[2:50:48] <%POUND_CAKE94> Hugeeee scaling in these games
[2:50:50] <Grandnatics> You have Shredder Rounds Pat
[2:50:52] <akitanito> otherwise known as oblivion bandits wearing glass armor
[2:50:58] <SaltyAzteca> SOKOLOV Kreygasm
[2:51:02] <Grandnatics> Those are way better for 90% of planets and Feros
[2:51:06] <+InternetShis> Pat, I want you to look up "Garrus ascends to godhood." You though he was good with a sniper, give him an AR and watch everything die instantly
[2:51:07] <+polothegreatest> skyward sword spite stream? when?
[2:51:16] <%AFellowDegen> WWO
[2:51:16] <BlueLunecy> YEAH
[2:51:17] <%QueequegTheater> YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
[2:51:18] <+butteryfan_> I LOVE THIS BUG
[2:51:19] <SaltyAzteca> THATS THE JANK YEYEYEYE
[2:51:19] <jackelzxaa> mods are worth it too
[2:51:20] <hat_under_bread> vijeo bames
[2:51:20] <%Ranryu692> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:51:20] <%shurtal> Find enough weapons, BUY armor
[2:51:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Isn't this the best armor in the game
[2:51:21] <stantheman_97> AW YEA BABY
[2:51:22] <Vantesla> LUL
[2:51:22] <$Captainahab_37> I'd say GoT got iffy around season like 5
[2:51:23] <%AFellowDegen> FUNKY DANCE TIME!
[2:51:23] <%dekkitout> Backing up!
[2:51:23] <Radioactive_Jam > thats the mass effect I know
[2:51:23] <KaiserMario> Prfect
[2:51:26] <RaidenRising> YEYE
[2:51:26] <Pyon84> That looks fine
[2:51:26] <%QueequegTheater> CROOKED SIGHT
[2:51:27] <+butteryfan_> Look at that jank
[2:51:29] <+titansloth93> JANK
[2:51:29] <%NCC1701Dave> love it
[2:51:30] <jackelzxaa> does pat have high explosive rounds yet
[2:51:32] <Ner234> jankjankjank
[2:51:32] <Dunmarkh> this is fine
[2:51:34] <semachie> hell yeah
[2:51:34] <set29> i always get that bug after looting shit but it doesnt correct itself
[2:51:35] <Daebunz> i had that happen multiple times
[2:51:36] <Lamokmok> Look at all these bugs fixed by Bioware!
[2:51:36] <peachy996> I usually want more alien armors
[2:51:37] <%Piemen99> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEEE
[2:51:38] <%kewlmyc> Farting out shotgun shots
[2:51:39] <+vaderxyz1970> Just joined has he accidentally used the gas grenades on the wrong enemy on that green planet yet?
[2:51:39] <RubberFistFight> so i didn't see the initial streams, did Pat save the block of wood or the massive space racist?
[2:51:39] <stantheman_97> YEAH DO IT
[2:51:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Moonwalking
[2:51:41] <%luckysteak> that man is focused
[2:51:41] <+Sebenoth> *chefs kiss*
[2:51:44] <%NCC1701Dave> THIS SHITS DOPE
[2:51:45] <%Jeemukun> I had this happen today!
[2:51:45] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt The Asteroid DLC has an option for some of the best armor in the game as a reward
[2:51:45] <James_Quivers> DYNAMIC CAMERA ANGELS
[2:51:48] <thetunnelhomer> Can you holster your gun?
[2:51:49] <peachy996> I think Garrus in Thermal Armor is a great look for him
[2:51:49] <Vantesla> Love this big wasn't patched out from original ironmouseKEK
[2:51:49] <sweatch0> look at him go
[2:51:52] <SaltyAzteca> Thats the nostalgia I wanna see!
[2:51:52] <jackelzxaa> its actually really fun to put high explosive rounds on an AR or Pistol and then try to get the heat mitigation to make sense
[2:51:55] <dd44dostivei> this bug wasn't on the 360
[2:52:02] <ChaosedStar> Edmontonion brilliance
[2:52:08] <Vantesla> bug... dang auto correct....
[2:52:13] <olaksi> @Captainahab_37 it really did, but most people didn't notice until affected their waifu
[2:52:14] <%templar010> Yeah thats new
[2:52:17] <jackelzxaa> that bug happened in me3 sometimes originally
[2:52:26] <ChaosedStar> wait thats new haha
[2:52:30] <%snow_bush> I had that once on the 360
[2:52:32] <+Punchasaur> This is why you were chosen for the spectres
[2:52:32] <buhbuhboat> I did the suicide mission in ME2 today and all the audio in the cutscenes just cut out completely which made things pretty anticlimactic
[2:52:41] <%Varlinator> That bug happened the most in ME2 for me
[2:52:41] <RubberFistFight> the FuckTruck
[2:52:41] <%snow_bush> Like, legitimately once
[2:52:41] <jackelzxaa> the worst bug for me in ME1 was when i brought up the power wheel the geth kept moving and it was so uncomfortable i actually froze up and got killed
[2:52:42] <Vantesla> I had it on 360, PC and PS3....
[2:52:43] <+SinnerEbru> maybe thats why, bc this wasn't the me1 engine (right?)
[2:52:47] <jackelzxaa> it felt like when dio saw jotaro's wrist move
[2:52:48] <Alzero83> Team Mako Go!
[2:52:51] <godzookylives> Shepard will not be constrained by your petty laws of physics
[2:52:51] <jackelzxaa> in the forzen time
[2:52:53] <morningmoondude> i'm glad im not the onlyone who loves the mako
[2:52:54] <%templar010> Its weird there are spectre weapons but no spectre armor or amps
[2:52:54] <thetunnelhomer> It's so satisfying hitting something with the canon
[2:52:58] <%AFellowDegen> I got a bug where I would get out of the Mako and have to reload because I couldn't interact with anything a decent amount
[2:53:00] <+samiscoolbro> Nah thats an old bug it happened to me
[2:53:00] <%templar010> or omnitools
[2:53:01] <%luckysteak> I love how the husk spikes are called "dragon's teeth" just like in the legend of...siegfried, I think?
[2:53:04] <Dfreddy8> It wouldn't be a BioWare game without bugs, new ones too.
[2:53:05] <%QueequegTheater> I named my Mako "The Fuck Machine"
[2:53:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Thinking of doing FF14 Free Trial. Whats a good class to start with ?
[2:53:11] <%skeletonmilk> why does pat have a 56 year old man head but the juicy ass of a 21 year old?
[2:53:15] <$Captainahab_37> I hope that the wheel of time show doesn't fuck up
[2:53:16] <Pookiedaexzile> YOu are
[2:53:19] <peachy996> There used to be a bug in ME3 console where going into a certain area on the Palaven moon would just kill you
[2:53:21] <buhbuhboat> Honestly LE feels like it has more bugs than the original games
[2:53:23] <tomahank18> Remember anyone that hasn’t played suicide mission in 2. Have Mordin escort the crew!
[2:53:24] <James_Quivers> I'M FUCKIN INVINCIBLE
[2:53:27] <+spartanluchador534> I dont think i would love ME1 as much without its jank
[2:53:27] <+toastchi> I thought dragons teeth are greek
[2:53:29] <RubberFistFight> on the PS3 i got a bug where my squaddies were glued to my character model so we were all running around in a line.
[2:53:33] <%AFellowDegen> @QueequegTheater Because it fucks u over a lot?
[2:53:34] <%DJFakie> On not-Insanity, pretty much, yeah.
[2:53:37] <+SinnerEbru> @skeletonmilk that spectre training keeps your body tight
[2:53:38] <Ner234> Sound delay?
[2:53:53] <$Captainahab_37> Husk bucks
[2:53:55] <%luckysteak> @TurtlesAndTentacles for Main story qeusts, I would recommend any DPS, as tank and healer classes are easier to level outside the main story than DPS
[2:53:55] <SaphronBlackbourne> @TurtlesAndTentacles Lancer I've haerd is pretty easy to start out with?
[2:54:00] <%AFellowDegen> money is just an object to burn
[2:54:01] <jackelzxaa> imagine if videogame shotguns were longrange like in real life
[2:54:05] <Dfreddy8> I used Thane for escort
[2:54:09] <Sunstalker> @tomahank18 Nah, just keep him with you to fight
[2:54:10] <%skeletonmilk> @skeletonmilk hcjSickos hcjGun2
[2:54:13] <$RealThiele> in 14 arcanist gives you summoner dps and scholar healing to try out
[2:54:18] <peachy996> The Biggening is starting to commence
[2:54:20] <Lamokmok> They're made of money!
[2:54:25] <KeystoneA2> @jackelzxaa Rising Storm 2's is
[2:54:31] <jackelzxaa> Pat are you gonna stick with vanguard the whole way through or are you gonna class switch in 2?
[2:54:37] <Oxybe> I just cannot look at husks without my monke brain thinking of Skullomania. I cant take them seriously...
[2:54:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Shotguns in real life have range, but a rifle still has more, its just that real life gun ranges aren't sexy
[2:54:42] <Vantesla> was that a savant?
[2:54:43] <peachy996> I use Mordin for escort because apparently he's easy to get killed without
[2:54:44] <SomeAsianDood> Some sort of high net worth individual
[2:54:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Damn you Cerberus!
[2:54:51] <Grandnatics> Oh those scamps
[2:54:51] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt Check that svant amp, I remember those being really good (in case you needed a better amp)
[2:54:52] <SaltyAzteca> Damn theyre so illusive
[2:54:59] <jackelzxaa> man cerberus sounds like the most evilest
[2:55:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @SaphronBlackbourne @luckysteak Thank you for the suggestions!
[2:55:05] <%walternatorz> and that was the last of that
[2:55:06] <jackelzxaa> i hope you never meet them
[2:55:08] <%AFellowDegen> @peachy996 same
[2:55:13] <Vantesla> @templar010 best amp I game
[2:55:14] <+butteryfan_> Man Cerberus what a bunch of asshats
[2:55:15] <peachy996> My first time playing the Suicide Mission I got 3 of my fav characters killed
[2:55:19] <morningmoondude> damn cerberus, they're so bad, would never want to work for them
[2:55:20] <+butteryfan_> Hopefully we never have to work with them
[2:55:22] <akitanito> gief threatened
[2:55:22] <thetunnelhomer> I miss when Cerberus was just wildly cartoonish evil
[2:55:26] <$Captainahab_37> When is the day we finally get a 40k hbo show
[2:55:27] <Dfreddy8> GIEF
[2:55:27] <peachy996> Mordin was one of them
[2:55:28] <%NateyBeak> i LOVE that geif hates this menu
[2:55:28] <%jillpilled> Gun psaGiefrail
[2:55:30] <%Piemen99> The boy awakens
[2:55:30] <$Captainahab_37> and its terrible
[2:55:33] <jackelzxaa> imagine if at the start of ME2 shepard just sees jacob and miranda and instantly kills them yelling CERBERUS!!!
[2:55:34] <%templar010> BOOM
[2:55:37] <%peanutdot007> psaDogchamp
[2:55:42] <thetunnelhomer> Damn, that was one hell of an AMP
[2:55:44] <Profmcstevie> The trilogy of upsetting Gief
[2:55:45] <%skeletonmilk> you look like commander shepard's drunk uncle
[2:55:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> Just wait for ME2 where Shephard's 2.8 million credits are stolen.
[2:55:53] <$RealThiele> Menuke
[2:55:56] <RubberFistFight> @peachy996 from bad decisions or did you fail their loyalty mission?
[2:55:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Gib Zangief a gun
[2:55:59] <peachy996> The other was Jack because of the stupid argument with Miranda and I made a bad call with Grunt leading the second team
[2:55:59] <tomahank18> @jackelzxaa they’d be better off with Jacob dead.
[2:56:00] <James_Quivers> @thetunnelhomer The only time they aren't is in 2, then they're back to their old ways in 3, lol
[2:56:00] <susukouhai> HE DID IT
[2:56:00] <%luckysteak> @TurtlesAndTentacles no problem. have fun with the game and remember that so long as you are trying, you are a valuable team mate
[2:56:02] <%walternatorz> what does Paige think of gun?
[2:56:13] <RubberFistFight> @skeletonmilk Chester "the molestor" Shepard.
[2:56:17] <ChaosedStar> Guns don't work on Giefs thiccness
[2:56:18] <%TheotherKristian> Hey, may anyone tell me how good is Jade Empire? I am thinking of playing it.

[2:56:27] <%skeletonmilk> @skeletonmilk LUL
[2:56:31] <peachy996> @RubberFistFight I figured Hey Grunts a Krogan he'll do fine. I was wrong
[2:56:34] <%shurtal> THREE SOLO BIRDS DOWN
[2:56:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @Too_Much_Nukie project Lazarus was not covered by Health Insurance
[2:56:39] <+Punchasaur> Apparently there’s a bloodborne show in development for hbo?
[2:56:41] <tomahank18> Jade empires combat is weird.
[2:56:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @luckysteak <3 Thank you

[2:57:14] <Srthunda> what even is the wallpaper
[2:57:15] <%kewlmyc> Wallpaper Engine LUL
[2:57:17] <Profmcstevie> OH NO, THE INSIGHT
[2:57:17] <%DianaTheAscian> ?????????
[2:57:18] <akitanito> I thought that was pat
[2:57:21] <Samurai_Tchan> crazy talk music
[2:57:27] <Minorou> wonder why wallpaper engine just sometimes does that
[2:57:30] <%Treuan> Evening all, what'd I miss?
[2:57:35] <tomahank18> I love Pat.
[2:57:41] <peachy996> Yeah so that stupid argument with Miranda is what got Jack killed my first time
[2:57:42] <Samurai_Tchan> Welcome to omega dance club
[2:57:44] <ne0bunny> silly pat, who doesnt turn off music in wallpaper engine's settings immediatly?
[2:57:47] <FirewallStorm> why am I hearing Boss music
[2:57:53] <%DashXero> What happened? I looked away for a minute.
[2:58:07] <tomahank18> Dogs gonna peepee
[2:58:36] <Dfreddy8> Gief is taking Pat out for a pee break
[2:58:40] <Samurai_Tchan> Watch these two human space slaves dance ,at laser gun point
[2:58:44] <peachy996> What's fun in a horrible way is making runs where everyone dies from ME1 to ME3.
[2:58:53] <+Punchasaur> Wallpaper engine will only play the first half second over whatever I’m playing/watching
[2:59:26] <peachy996> Involves thinking on how you can kill people later on vs offing them at the end of 1/2
[2:59:28] <tomahank18> Isn’t there playthrough of 3 where you end up with JUST Edi, Liara, and James?
[2:59:52] <peachy996> You can technically kill those 4 by picking Refuse
[3:00:23] <Samurai_Tchan> i wish ME4 could import the final player decision of ME3 ,changing the tone of the entire game .
[3:00:47] <aiutare47> Anyone else kinda miss the old Voltabass brb? I like this a lot but  the old one had a je ne sais quoi
[3:00:47] <%cylish> huh, pats the biggest ME stream in the world right now. neat

[3:10:56] <Wolfstriker121> It’s a bugg I had it as well and my friends
[3:11:00] <Samurai_Tchan> FINALLY DEFEATED by a hack console
[3:11:03] <sweatch0> elmo zoom
[3:11:04] <%sporeian94> PAt it's a glitch get off the ship and reload
[3:11:07] <Wolfstriker121> On that part
[3:11:10] <%Varlinator> Just like old times, Shepard
[3:11:15] <dd44dostivei> i think dead salarian npcs do this. it gets really bad on virmire
[3:11:15] <ioci2112> like real police
[3:11:16] <+Sebenoth> yeah, this happened on orher streams
[3:11:18] <%byuniart> Let Garrus shoot someone
[3:11:20] <aiutare47> Garrus NEEDS Shepard to balance out his innate murderboner. He needs a good cop to his awful.
[3:11:21] <akitanito> you shot him
[3:11:21] <jackelzxaa> wrex shot him, garrus didnt.  ;-)
[3:11:22] <Ner234> Shoot him the BACK like a HERO.
[3:11:27] <%byuniart> Don't be a narc
[3:11:32] <dero45> but it what you wanted
[3:11:33] <DatAsuna> Garrus feared for his life
[3:11:34] <+abrupt_abe> Just like a real cop!
[3:11:38] <%captain_thickthighs> Space Cops all the same, that salarain was dark skinned.
[3:11:38] <Samurai_Tchan> garrus is samuel l jackson and shepard john travolta
[3:11:41] <%aBlueWizard> wrex wouldn't have even let him run
[3:11:43] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Just like John Wayne woulda done woolieFABRICATION
[3:11:45] <%strugglepunk2> Honestly as much as narc as paragon shepard is, I think the idea of the special super above the law agent man being the type of person that sincerely and legitimately thinks those laws are important and are there to prevent abuse of power is pretty neat and cool honestly.
[3:11:48] <+Sebenoth> everyone garrus kills magically becomes guilty of crimes, its very convenient
[3:11:48] <%jillpilled> KKona I feared for my life brother
[3:11:50] <sweatch0> hello elmo
[3:11:53] <jackelzxaa> i am pretty sure wrex took the shot
[3:11:55] <%aBlueWizard> giving garrus shit but you'd clap if wrex did it.
[3:11:56] <FilthyGraveLover> You know it's bad when he's got the excuse for shooting someone in the back PRELOADED
[3:11:56] <HeroToxiko> He "faded into the wilderness" mysterious like db cooper
[3:11:57] <rekinom> "If he didn't want me to shoot him he shouldn't have broken the law. Blue lives matter shepard"
[3:11:57] <%Rumbutt> and people say Doc is wrong for saying Garrus is a cop, when this mission is right here
[3:12:05] <%Monkeyweed21> talk to Garrus
[3:12:06] <%toolofparanoia> Be patient with garrus he has crippling BY THE BOOKNESS
[3:12:09] <+polothegreatest> just sprinkle some crack, let get out of here garrus
[3:12:14] <peachy996> Paragon Shep does have a history of cockblocking Garrus revenge-y murderboner
[3:12:16] <%Ranryu692> @strugglepunk2 definitely
[3:12:17] <dashmatt> blind
[3:12:19] <%slimmixrp> No
[3:12:19] <%MrBorisMakarov> pat theres two there
[3:12:21] <peachy996> Does it like 3 times?
[3:12:21] <tomahank18> Did Pat punch reporter woman? Or is that just in 2
[3:12:22] <%peanutdot007> There's two
[3:12:22] <RubberFistFight> @Sebenoth "Quick Shepard, sprinkle some space crack on him and let's get outta here."
[3:12:23] <%toolofparanoia> THE BOOK OF MILITARISM
[3:12:29] <peachy996> Heart, Harkin and Sidonis
[3:12:31] <Grandnatics> @toolofparanoia he's the opposite of by the book
[3:12:33] <aiutare47> Doc isnt wrong that Garrus is shit, Doc is wrong in saying Garrus never gets better.
[3:12:33] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat
[3:12:39] <%Jumpie8> Elmo is like "You are Winning, Pat?"
[3:12:40] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlep psaWhat
[3:12:44] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[3:12:46] <Grandnatics> he's so cowboy he can't even stay on station and quits
[3:12:54] <%toolofparanoia> @toolofparanoia ITCHY TRIGGER FINGER I MEANT
[3:12:54] <Grandnatics> ah
[3:12:59] <$dalmek> @tomahank18 he DID in fact punch a reporter woman this run
[3:13:05] <%captain_thickthighs> @Sebenoth we gonna introduce crack in those Krogan Ghettos
[3:13:06] <%aBlueWizard> talk to garrus on the ship
[3:13:13] <$dalmek> although I don't remember if he reloaded afterwards
[3:13:16] <tomahank18> @dalmek good
[3:13:20] <RubberFistFight> Garrus is a weird combination of big authoritarianism with a very strong sense of justice.
[3:13:22] <peachy996> This is the bugs
[3:13:26] <thelonechris> Or like every planet you've been to
[3:13:27] <+InternetShis> Not enough radioactive rubble
[3:13:32] <peachy996> Wait is this the bugs?
[3:13:41] <jackelzxaa> yeah you can land here without the quest
[3:13:41] <aiutare47> @RubberFistFight Those two often go hand in hand
[3:13:44] <Grandnatics> Unexplored icon
[3:13:46] <jackelzxaa> you just have to find the hideout again
[3:13:49] <dashmatt> There's two systems in this cluster
[3:13:50] <Grandnatics> by the materials
[3:13:54] <Grandnatics> Minable rocks
[3:13:55] <jackelzxaa> now you can enter the hideout
[3:13:55] <%Treuan> Oh yeah it's that question mark that didn't go away
[3:14:00] <jackelzxaa> you cant open the door without the quest
[3:14:00] <+InternetShis> @rubberfistfight "Turian Rebel" is his unique trait for a reason
[3:14:05] <Lamokmok> Are there giant worms though?
[3:14:11] <+Sebenoth> @rubberfistfight so like.. odo from ds9?
[3:14:11] <%peanutdot007> There's two systems in this cluster
[3:14:12] <pth88> Yes
[3:14:14] <+Punchasaur> Elmo wants you to shoot the racist woman
[3:14:35] <%Jumpie8> LUL
[3:14:36] <IrishWeegee> holy shit
[3:14:37] <Parapattern> Elmo is interested
[3:14:37] <akitanito> impressive
[3:14:37] <thetunnelhomer> Oh huh. Stabler is back on SVU. Didn't see that coming.
[3:14:38] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Wrong system Pat
[3:14:43] <thetunnelhomer> Didn't he get sent to super jail?
[3:14:45] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight True
[3:14:48] <+InternetShis> That's why we always use DisplayPort
[3:14:53] <akitanito> that's a late dinner
[3:14:55] <aiutare47> yeah dude no problem
[3:14:55] <%blastazoid00> Elmo is frozen
[3:14:58] <thelonechris> 12:30 dinner
[3:14:58] <+InternetShis> He knew HDMI was garbage
[3:15:02] <IrishWeegee> Yeah, thanks for the 3 hour heads up LUL
[3:15:05] <%aBlueWizard> talk to garrus
[3:15:15] <Aleate> Elmo looks so majestic
[3:15:19] <%slimmixrp> Yes
[3:15:22] <%Treuan> Hidden
[3:15:26] <tomahank18> You should eat so late. It’s not good for your health.
[3:15:29] <%captain_thickthighs> what breed is Elmo?
[3:15:30] <%aBlueWizard> secret star system
[3:15:35] <+Sebenoth> Sokay pat, food is important, if gief is to be believed
[3:15:38] <sweatch0> elmo so cool
[3:15:41] <%captainpodock> who's more likely to have a renegade run Elmo or Zangief?
[3:15:55] <sweatch0> hes got style and grace
[3:15:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> what
[3:15:55] <%blastazoid00> I love it when elmo just sits there
[3:15:56] <trianglehat> monke
[3:15:56] <%bread_assassin> Elmo for sure.
[3:15:59] <ioci2112> monke
[3:16:00] <+Sebenoth> Elmo is renegade for sure
[3:16:00] <+NotaryRotary> monke
[3:16:02] <RubberFistFight> @tomahank18 if this is the middle of the day for Pat then it's fine. It's not the time of day that makes the difference so much as where the meal takes place on your personal "clock".
[3:16:03] <semachie> elmo the best
[3:16:07] <%Deft_Thought> Is Elmo schleep
[3:16:07] <Parapattern> Mmmm...monke
[3:16:08] <+ryuguitarfreak> God, I love this song so much
[3:16:11] <thewhiterice92> elmo looks like an owl that is falling asleep
[3:16:14] <+Punchasaur> PATashi
[3:16:16] <%mikeriffic> iLOVE HOW ELMO JUST SITS BESIDES PAT ON A PERCH, FALLING ASLEEP, also caps yay
[3:16:17] <%jillpilled> Elmo is teeming with renegade energy
[3:16:17] <$Faustgesicht> He's pretty close tbh
[3:16:18] <%Deft_Thought> He's so good and fluffy
[3:16:24] <%blastazoid00> Embrqce tradition, return to monke
[3:16:28] <dashmatt> same
[3:16:34] <%JamesCorck> OK, off I go. I'll catch the VoD when it's out! Laters you guys <3 Have fun with the Effects of the Masses, Pat <3 psaDogchamp
[3:16:35] <tomahank18> @rubberfistfight I just want Pat to live forever
[3:16:48] <%Treuan> yup
[3:16:49] <%captain_thickthighs> yep
[3:16:49] <+YabbaTroll> click clack
[3:16:50] <%Jumpie8> yes
[3:16:51] <Parapattern> Yes
[3:16:51] <IrishWeegee> sounds like snapping
[3:16:51] <rekinom> yes
[3:16:53] <akitanito> you mean the clicking noise
[3:16:53] <RubberFistFight> that weird clicking?
[3:16:54] <%Kilagn> Kilagn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Woah! Mass Effect! How many butt shots were removed from each game in this addition? psaWhat
[3:16:54] <LluthyY> yeah
[3:16:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> sounds like your jaw clicking
[3:16:56] <$lotharrio> Sounds like mouth noises.
[3:17:00] <%Ranryu692> I got up at 9 today and didn't eat breakfast until after 5 LUL
[3:17:04] <+LionKagura> yes please stop
[3:17:12] <%Kilagn> Fuck. Edition not addition
[3:17:12] <+Sebenoth> ..yes?
[3:17:16] <RubberFistFight> @tomahank18 then invent toilet transformation tech.
[3:17:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Is your dog Niel Cicierega
[3:17:18] <RubberFistFight> :P
[3:17:21] <%GarbageNirvana> *Neil
[3:17:23] <%GarbageNirvana> wow I'm tired
[3:17:25] <rekinom> It's not unpleasant to hear for what it's worth
[3:17:27] <viewtifulr> that clicking?
[3:17:30] <jackelzxaa> yeah this is more like it
[3:17:34] <jackelzxaa> i thought the sky didnt look right
[3:17:36] <+red_cuppa> i have woken u to regal elmo awwww look at him
[3:17:41] <Dfreddy8> They shot first
[3:17:43] <Lamokmok> Shepard
[3:17:43] <%MrBorisMakarov> imagine standing there guarding for days just to get shot by a cannon
[3:17:44] <+red_cuppa> up*
[3:17:44] <viewtifulr> then yes, its nice and clear
[3:17:48] <jackelzxaa> i can't believe i've nearly memorized the look of every side planet in me1
[3:17:49] <%captainpodock> is Elmo captivate by the movement of the Mako he seems like he is in a trance lol
[3:18:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> I wish that if you didn't do this quest Wrex had a different armor in 2/3.
[3:18:07] <jackelzxaa> i feel like when mike stolklasa talks about star trek whenever i get to talk about mass effect
[3:18:14] <%DJFakie> That pause gives you the quest in case you don't have it
[3:18:14] <+Sebenoth> Theres something about using a tank round on infantry that doesnt feel very paragon of shep
[3:18:16] <peachy996> I'm saddened by how quiet the enemies are now
[3:18:25] <peachy996> They don't even say GOGOGOGO anymore
[3:18:26] <tomahank18> I have to imagine that 90% of the people Shepard and Crew run up on are not expecting to ever be found
[3:18:27] <%MisterRockett> Why are you fighting humans?
[3:18:32] <SaltyAzteca> Tonn Actus
[3:18:34] <%captain_thickthighs> Ah Wrex, warrior races are the best  in any scifi
[3:18:35] <%captainpodock> Emlo good boy
[3:18:37] <Grandnatics> Good think you're invincible
[3:18:42] <peachy996> When's the last time you heard Enemies are Everywhere
[3:18:43] <tomahank18> Like you’re in the middle of nowhere
[3:18:46] <%DJFakie> @misterrockett They stole Wrex's stuff
[3:19:02] <$Faustgesicht> Yeah, the voice lines gave the game jank character
[3:19:07] <James_Quivers> Army men toys banging together
[3:19:10] <RubberFistFight> yeah the way the player character "connects" to the controls is super strange in ME1
[3:19:11] <jackelzxaa> @PatStaresAt do you know what difficulty you're gonna play 2 and 3 on?
[3:19:15] <Grandnatics> For a human sure
[3:19:16] <Psyramics> that's the krogan way, man
[3:19:16] <akitanito> it's finneeee
[3:19:18] <%captain_thickthighs> like the armor bear in golden compex
[3:19:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> its Krogan though
[3:19:19] <SaltyAzteca> You get paid to murder
[3:19:20] <+Ancopro> but its for wrex bro
[3:19:20] <Grandnatics> this is a dull Krogan affair
[3:19:22] <RubberFistFight> it feels like you're offset on one axis or something, not just visually.
[3:19:24] <bossfight1> yeah but they're pirates, therefore they must die
[3:19:26] <%captainpodock> Shepare
[3:19:28] <stantheman_97> not for wrex
[3:19:35] <+HanbaobaoZaiNar> what is the appropriate amount of murder for some ceremonial armor?
[3:19:35] <Dfreddy8> Pirates=bad
[3:19:36] <dd44dostivei> shoot up that museum
[3:19:36] <%aBlueWizard> murder for armor = good, murdering a man doing research on living people = don't do that it's wrong.
[3:19:38] <RubberFistFight> elmo lik
[3:19:38] <brexdq> you've murdered for less
[3:19:38] <%peanutdot007> A single piece of ceremonial armor taken before any of the people involved were alive
[3:19:41] <rekinom> They're colonists who genocided a race and stole their cultural artifacts to sell Pat
[3:19:58] <dd44dostivei> whatever.
[3:20:00] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:20:00] <Dfreddy8> Whatever
[3:20:02] <tomahank18> @peanutdot007 which is saying a lot because Wrex is old as shit
[3:20:03] <James_Quivers> Whatever
[3:20:03] <%captainpodock> Shepard is supposed to be an item soldier but sounds out of breath after a brisk sprint
[3:20:06] <RedPlasticCup> Whatever.
[3:20:06] <%AFellowDegen> *blush*
[3:20:06] <%AbnormalVoid> b-baka...
[3:20:07] <Lamokmok> Now kiss
[3:20:07] <%GinAndRoses> i love you too wrex
[3:20:10] <%jillpilled> Whatever..

[3:20:24] <sweatch0> wrex is cool
[3:20:25] <Parapattern> Give 'im a smooch
[3:20:25] <IrishWeegee> LUL
[3:20:25] <%DJFakie> Free pass on Virmire now
[3:20:26] <%captainpodock> Aww
[3:20:28] <%Monkeyweed21> I forgot how bad the loyalty missions in 1 are
[3:20:29] <karl_rex> Doesn't he wear it in 2?
[3:20:32] <akitanito> pat. eli.
[3:20:32] <+CursedNobleman> LUL
[3:20:33] <Lamokmok> Lol
[3:20:33] <stantheman_97> including the massacre?
[3:20:34] <+LionKagura> LUL
[3:20:35] <%captain_thickthighs> ba baka
[3:20:35] <%BigCoffee> Urdnot Plague
[3:20:36] <%trustycoyote> Cute
[3:20:37] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt how long before Wrex starts telling you facts about space duck penises? :P
[3:20:38] <semachie> lmao
[3:20:39] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYE
[3:20:39] <bossfight1> Weird, Wrex never gave me furry porn...
[3:20:40] <James_Quivers> How dare you, Wrex isn't a furry
[3:20:43] <+Sebenoth> LUL
[3:20:44] <sweatch0> what wrex smell like?
[3:20:44] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah that's about right
[3:20:45] <%mrgaster8> mrgaster8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 7 month streak! psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[3:20:47] <%Monkeyweed21> these loyalty missions suck ass compared to 2
[3:20:51] <hat_under_bread> LUL
[3:20:51] <akitanito> but you don't get that option
[3:20:57] <peachy996> Ashley never talks to Wrex thats the funniest thing
[3:21:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> I remember when Wrex went on a long tangent about horse breeding and the quality of the internet in the outh
[3:21:01] <$hattrick61> SHE DOESN'T EVEN TALK FIRST
[3:21:01] <SaltyAzteca> Suplex them toes
[3:21:03] <%byuniart> You should totally just shoot ashley
[3:21:04] <dd44dostivei> ashley killed wrex my first playthrough
[3:21:04] <%Agami23> i bet krogans smell sandy
[3:21:04] <viewtifulr> I really wonder what it looks like, the armor that is
[3:21:05] <akitanito> can you point the gun away?
[3:21:05] <%Jumpie8> but Plague would talk about furrie porn
[3:21:10] <%byuniart> Show her what that blicky do
[3:21:12] <+Sebenoth> The eternal plague dilemma of “are you even having fun wrex, i cant tell”
[3:21:13] <jackelzxaa> is pat planning to blow ashley up with the bomb?
[3:21:13] <+trackles_64> hates guns
[3:21:16] <$hattrick61> just *bang* hatecrimed
[3:21:18] <%GarbageNirvana> I wish every moral choice gave you an option to shoot Ashley
[3:21:22] <Hanzmolman> Who’s the worst partner in me?
[3:21:24] <bossfight1> @sweatch0 I'd imagine something like smoke or burnt flesh
[3:21:25] <brexdq> yes put on a helmet you creepy uncle
[3:21:26] <tomahank18> Ashley just wanted to shoot an alien
[3:21:33] <jackelzxaa> i'll be sad if we dont get to keep kirahe, he's exactly half as good as mordin, which is 3 times better than all other salarians
[3:21:33] <TourettesPlays> WOW that biotic amp is nutty
[3:21:38] <tomahank18> She thought he was a regular toad. Couldn’t tell the difference
[3:21:39] <RubberFistFight> Wrex: "Look, Shepard. I'm not a space furry, alright? I just draw lots and lots and lots of space furry art."
[3:21:41] <jbrachob> elmo fucking loves item management
[3:21:43] <stantheman_97> he hates gun
[3:21:47] <%MrBorisMakarov> elmo is entranced
[3:21:48] <+trackles_64> elmo is completely fine with it.
[3:21:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Save or kill the Rachni queen? Neither, shoot Ashley
[3:21:50] <Lamokmok> I mean, you get a a chance to shoot Ash, way later though.
[3:21:52] <%kullumanati> Gief
[3:21:53] <%GinAndRoses> he protective boy
[3:21:53] <dashmatt> speaking of maw
[3:21:56] <%DakotaMacDoodle> He is trying to protect
[3:21:58] <peachy996> That's true make sure you save Kirrahe
[3:21:58] <%byuniart> @GarbageNirvana Killing Ashley is always morally correct
[3:22:02] <%Buzzard42> Buzzard42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Flip the Mako
[3:22:03] <jackelzxaa> Salarians go: Mordin > Kirahe > the list is over go home
[3:22:05] <FeralFozzie> let the bork flow thru you!
[3:22:05] <%bread_assassin> @Hanzmolman As a character or gameplaywise?
[3:22:07] <SaltyAzteca> Does the bug still work where you can jump and shoot and they wont move?
[3:22:16] <Broken_Sonex> Can you IMAGINE if Krogans were into Furry porn?
[3:22:19] <tomahank18> I totally believe Kaiden becoming a spectre over Ashley... which is why you let her die
[3:22:23] <jbrachob> Its the autoblow 3000cable
[3:22:31] <bossfight1> I had to replay half of my FemShep playthrough because I got locked onto the Kaiden romance (when my heart belongs to Garrus); as a precaution I left Kaiden to die on Virmire.
[3:22:31] <peachy996> Kirrahe is pretty important for Salarian support in 3 plus he's a cool guy
[3:22:38] <$Faustgesicht> Suspiciously Rich Krogans
[3:22:38] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> @byuniart agree
[3:22:43] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Agreed
[3:22:51] <%jillpilled> @broken_sonex Sure some on Tuchanka have gotten bored enough to get into something like that
[3:22:53] <+CursedNobleman> @Broken_Sonex "How do krogans mate?"
[3:22:58] <James_Quivers> Is there a lore reason why thresher maws are on like every planet?
[3:23:10] <tomahank18> @faustgesicht Crazy, Rich Krogans
[3:23:14] <peachy996> spores
[3:23:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yes.
[3:23:24] <Broken_Sonex> @jillpilled "What's all this about?" - Grunt
[3:23:31] <+CursedNobleman> krogans spread them like invasive species like humans spread rats? @James_Quivers
[3:23:32] <Dunmarkh> seems legit
[3:23:32] <$Futurecity10> They are fungus
[3:23:33] <%Monkeyweed21> they are Greenskins
[3:23:35] <ioci2112> spores travel huge distances through space so they are basically everywhere
[3:23:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> Thresher Maws reproduce by firing spores into space that are nearly indestructible.
[3:23:37] <%mikeriffic> Spores
[3:23:42] <%bread_assassin> @James_Quivers I think there spores attach to spaceships or something.
[3:23:45] <%mikeriffic> they reproduce through spores
[3:23:45] <%captain_thickthighs> you need sand worms in planet dessert, its the law
[3:23:46] <Shatterthought> @James_Quivers Kalros got around in her youth
[3:23:50] <%mikeriffic> the sports get on ships and shit
[3:23:50] <+YabbaTroll> cause there eggs survive reentry, I forget how they et into space in the first place
[3:23:55] <%mikeriffic> and then they land and grow
[3:23:55] <+trackles_64> thresher maps are basically bugs from starship troopers
[3:23:58] <+CursedNobleman> no, im bullshitting sir @PatStaresAt
[3:23:59] <dd44dostivei> did i miss the inner light pyramid?
[3:23:59] <stantheman_97> they bust fat nuts into space
[3:24:04] <akitanito> so zergs
[3:24:10] <+D00msDayDan> if only there was a codex you could read up on it
[3:24:13] <+InternetShis> They're spores that latch on to ships like birds shitting seeds
[3:24:14] <%byuniart> He really hates these mountains
[3:24:15] <James_Quivers> Are you guys telling me thresher maws are space barnacles
[3:24:18] <%bread_assassin> The codex entry says why.
[3:24:20] <James_Quivers> that's fucked
[3:24:22] <$Futurecity10> Read the codex entry on them, its voiced
[3:24:25] <holsety5> its right in the codex
[3:24:27] <$Faustgesicht> Threshers just kinda jizz into space like assholes
[3:24:27] <%Monkeyweed21> they work like Warhammer Orcs
[3:24:33] <%logoth_> Survey minerals by playing frogger
[3:24:34] <%zyberion626> read the codex entry on em @patstaresat
[3:24:35] <+CursedNobleman> thresher codex!
[3:24:43] <$hattrick61> They shoot their goo into space and wherever it goes they go
[3:24:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> If you play Sole Survivor Shephard should start hyper ventilating every time you fight a thresher.
[3:24:44] <+HanbaobaoZaiNar> man, it'd have to be really cold for that to be a solid mercury deposit
[3:24:50] <+trackles_64> Hack the rock
[3:24:57] <%Treuan> Wow, you've just about cleared it out
[3:25:09] <+trackles_64> the geth mission is long.
[3:25:14] <Dfreddy8> Hmmmmm
[3:25:22] <%Monkeyweed21> read your codex
[3:25:22] <peachy996> i told you
[3:25:26] <jackelzxaa> no pat, it's 4 and then a 5th opens up
[3:25:28] <peachy996> It's a long one
[3:25:31] <Dfreddy8> 5
[3:25:32] <%CatastropheCorvid> Just got here. Did I miss anything important?
[3:25:40] <trianglehat> af
[3:25:42] <+Sebenoth> Pats food will arrive before mine.. sad times
[3:25:44] <SaltyAzteca> LOOKIT THAT GUY RUN
[3:25:45] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat thresher maws reproduce via spores which can survive in space
[3:25:47] <ioci2112> kinda like pat
[3:25:49] <Wolfstriker121> Yeah take a break now
[3:25:51] <tomahank18> @catastrophecorvid Ashley was a space racist
[3:25:54] <Wolfstriker121> It’s long
[3:25:55] <Manderfuzz> NNNFF that VOICE ACTOR <3
[3:25:56] <Vantesla> Be kinda cool if in Krogan War that Krogans would use spores to infect other planets. To try also taking claim given how they are use to fighting and living with Threshers. Also it show Krogans don't care about ware crimes if win LUL
[3:26:00] <Broken_Sonex> @CatastropheCorvid Wrex got his dumb armour back
[3:26:00] <KaitlynnHere> I’m back, is pat breaking the game?
[3:26:03] <arkv01> these are TOUGH motherfuckers
[3:26:04] <+ryuguitarfreak> Voiced Codex Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:26:05] <%DianaTheAscian> wow
[3:26:08] <karl_rex> They're fungus!?
[3:26:10] <akitanito> I can't believe they are just mold
[3:26:16] <%Ynkubus_> fucking space bobbin worms man
[3:26:18] <@Pandora_Prime> Oh my god Imiss the codex
[3:26:23] <%Ynkubus_> bobbit*
[3:26:23] <KaitlynnHere> Oh cool so they can swim in space
[3:26:23] <%CatastropheCorvid> @tomahank18 So, nothing and no-one important? :D
[3:26:23] <+InternetShis> Orks
[3:26:25] <akitanito> YOU FOOL

[3:26:31] <Lamokmok> F
[3:26:31] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT
[3:26:33] <Aleate> Wait, from the earth?
[3:26:34] <James_Quivers> They're the molded, therefore Ethan WInters is a threasher maw
[3:26:36] <%jillpilled> SOILED IT
[3:26:37] <%Ranryu692> what happened?
[3:26:37] <IrishWeegee> DUN GOOFED
[3:26:37] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Broken_Sonex Neat! Thanks.
[3:26:37] <GustauveVIII> THE THRESHER MAW IS A LAVOS

[3:26:41] <%The_Protagonist> doomsd14Death
[3:26:41] <arkv01> ogeeey
[3:26:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> Basically they're like barnacles on the bottom of ships?
[3:26:49] <tomahank18> Do you think you can eat thresher maws?
[3:26:51] <%DJFakie> See ya soon!
[3:26:51] <SaltyAzteca> Alright lads, poop time
[3:26:53] <IrishWeegee> rescKb
[3:26:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> s'all good
[3:26:56] <Broken_Sonex> WHY DID YOU PUT YOUR HAND THERE?! I SAW IT
[3:26:57] <arkv01> take your time
[3:27:00] <akitanito> eating stream
[3:27:01] <nevan_44> he's going away forever :(
[3:27:01] <+Gespens> Threshers are NOT a fungus, they are what is called a "Broadcast Spawner." Lots of polychates are broadcast spawners
[3:27:02] <%Ranryu692> take as long as you need
[3:27:06] <peachy996> I'm gonna go look to see if Kirrahe can be saved, while Kaiden can be killed
[3:27:07] <RubberFistFight> Pat's Big McFuckyWucky
[3:27:08] <battlexqueen> cool time to cook
[3:27:11] <KaitlynnHere> Why not make it an even half an hour
[3:27:12] <%Monkeyweed21> you have been gone for like 30 minutes pooping before
[3:27:12] <leinadtonu> just play some jank jonk
[3:27:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> Time to watch anime girl wrestling while I wait for Orb Father
[3:27:17] <RetributionP> Normandy music > BRB music
[3:27:19] <Dfreddy8> Have a Eating stream!!!
[3:27:29] <morningmoondude> Hope he doesn't pull a my dad on us and never comes back
[3:27:37] <peachy996> Ashley needs to be shot in 3 but not at the expense of a dead Kirrahe in this Virmire mission
[3:27:46] <ttc_lover> Nah eat king
[3:27:48] <tomahank18> Now that Pats gone we can talk about how kissable he is
[3:28:04] <KaitlynnHere> @retributionp best music, I have the some mass effect OS on my playlist
[3:28:13] <KaitlynnHere> Especially the map music
[3:28:14] <+Punchasaur> Ashley needs to be shot in 1
[3:28:15] <+Sebenoth> Nah, we need to take this time to formalize a gief cult
[3:28:44] <KaitlynnHere> @punchasaur esplain?
[3:28:55] <peachy996> Ashley doesn't get shot in 1
[3:29:00] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Sebenoth As long as there's an Elmo chapter of this Gief Cult, then you son of a bitch, I'm in.
[3:29:04] <tomahank18> My stream is for sure like 2-3 minutes slow
[3:29:05] <peachy996> She gets nuked and hailed as a hero
[3:29:13] <+Punchasaur> But she should be
[3:29:16] <KaitlynnHere> Oh I thought you said slot, not shot
[3:29:31] <KaitlynnHere> I’m like “uuuhhh... no?”
[3:29:36] <peachy996> It seems you just have to take care of the Geth fliers to keep Kirrahe alive, the other stuff determines how much of his team is left
[3:29:41] <%QueequegTheater> I like Ashley
[3:29:57] <peachy996> I like Ashley in ME1, not 3
[3:30:03] <tomahank18> I’m sure Ashley likes you, you’re human.
[3:30:08] <KaitlynnHere> Does she get any character development or does she stay her racist self the whole game?
[3:30:15] <Jaysky> In theory you could bring Ashley along every mission and purposely send her out to get shot and downed, just leave her there so she may experience pain.
[3:30:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> ↑
[3:30:19] <%QueequegTheater> She's not racist
[3:30:24] <peachy996> Yeah but I want to bang alien dudes so probably not lol
[3:30:26] <tomahank18> @kaitlynnhere she gets hot
[3:30:41] <Jolnir> you could
[3:30:42] <+LemonyLilly> ashley apologist train incoming
[3:30:43] <%QueequegTheater> @tomahank18 This guy gets it
[3:30:43] <Broken_Sonex> I hate Ashley's fucking hair bun. Makes her so much more annoying for some reason
[3:30:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> Comparing aliens to animals and expressing disdain and mistrust is pretty fuckin racist.
[3:30:55] <+Punchasaur> I mean outside the xenophobia she’s also just bitchy
[3:31:01] <Jaysky> @kaitlynnhere She says, "it should have been me to die not Kaiden"
[3:31:07] <peachy996> She's not as racist as time goes on but she trades that with distrusting you cuz you worked for Cereberus
[3:31:11] <KaitlynnHere> “Uhm actually”
[3:31:11] <tomahank18> @broken_sonex she looks so much better without the hair bun
[3:31:23] <peachy996> So she's just a different type of shitty person to be around
[3:31:25] <%QueequegTheater> @CatastropheCorvid First one is a bug, and the second one is explicitly proven correct by the events of 3
[3:31:31] <+Sebenoth> Feels like ashley was purposefully designed to show just how little humanity has advanced in ME
[3:31:36] <Broken_Sonex> @tomahank18 She also got plumber lips. Real bimbo. I liked it
[3:31:45] <%Puhff> Her sister Abby sounds way. Master swordswoman who loves corsets
[3:31:56] <%QueequegTheater> @tomahank18 This guy gets it
[3:31:56] <%Puhff> Way cooler
[3:31:57] <KaitlynnHere> @jaysky I think kaiden says the same thing right? Or is he like “man I’m glad that bitch is dead”
[3:32:25] <%THOUTHPAW> i just think kaiden is incredibly boring, which is why i always keep ashley around
[3:32:32] <+Punchasaur> So it took them til the end of the trilogy to run it back lol
[3:32:34] <Jaysky> @kaitlynnhere He does, they have similar arcs. It'd be hilarious if he said that though
[3:32:36] <tomahank18> I think they had to make Ashley look more “traditionally hot” in 2 because Miranda shows up and they wanted people to actually keep the romance with Ashley up until 3 lol
[3:32:56] <KaitlynnHere> @jaysky we just need a mod for it
[3:32:58] <Jaysky> Kaiden is less boring in 3
[3:33:05] <peachy996> I say nuke Kaiden for being boring and shoot Ashley in 3 for being Ashley
[3:33:11] <Broken_Sonex> @tomahank18 Well in that can they should have given her a bigger ass
[3:33:13] <peachy996> Up to Pat though
[3:33:24] <%Taisuru> I only wish there was an option to kill both
[3:33:28] <peachy996> He'll probably nuke Ash on pure temptation alone
[3:33:31] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Tali is best girl though
[3:33:35] <tomahank18> Does Ashley have any real business being a Spectre by 3?
[3:33:47] <Lamokmok> Pat wants to kill Ash himself, so Kaiden has to go.
[3:33:48] <Broken_Sonex> No.
[3:33:50] <KaitlynnHere> Tali is best girl
[3:33:52] <+Soliloquy123> Both Kaiden and Ashley get a lot better in ME3 imp
[3:33:53] <peachy996> Not really
[3:33:55] <KaitlynnHere> I wanna hug her
[3:33:56] <Jaysky> @taisuru There is. It's just different games
[3:33:59] <peachy996> Kaiden isn't made one
[3:34:00] <%QueequegTheater> I think it's implied she does a lot between 2 and 3 fighting Cerberus
[3:34:19] <Jaysky> @kaitlynnhere A natural feeling. Tali is best
[3:34:22] <James_Quivers> I wanna hug and then fug tali
[3:34:30] <Lamokmok> Besides, the one who dies in Virmire dies a hero, can't let that be Ash
[3:34:36] <tomahank18> @queequegtheater I was gonna say, I totally get Kaiden. He’s got the experience and the powers
[3:34:38] <%THOUTHPAW> basically jack is the best human companion
[3:34:48] <KaitlynnHere> @james_quivers noooooo! Your human genitalia will make her sick tho!
[3:34:58] <%QueequegTheater> Vega > Jack
[3:35:01] <tomahank18> @thouthpaw but Zaeed exists
[3:35:07] <peachy996> Although the Aliens and Animals line gets misread as a positive if she dies
[3:35:08] <%jillpilled> I guess I could see her or Kaidan being picked to counter Cerberus and the rumors surrounding Shep, but otherwise her being a spectre is kinda pointless
[3:35:08] <Broken_Sonex> @THOUTHPAW Too tryhard. I perfer Kasumi
[3:35:10] <%Puhff> I like Kaiden
[3:35:10] <Jaysky> @kaitlynnhere Sick AS FUCK
[3:35:12] <peachy996> That's hilarious
[3:35:14] <%afronooch> zaeeds lame
[3:35:28] <KaitlynnHere> @thouthpaw I loved jack but the nicer I was to her the more she told me to fuck off :/
[3:35:34] <%QueequegTheater> @peachy996 oh that's fucking funny
[3:35:35] <%Puhff> He's nice and is chill w aliens
[3:35:57] <peachy996> They take Ashley's worst line and spin it as a positive in the news for her memorial lmao
[3:36:00] <tomahank18> @afronooch the only way to keep Zaeeds loyalty is to light a fucker on fire right? That’s rad
[3:36:06] <%THOUTHPAW> kasumi has a great intro and mission but i didnt end up using her much. zaeed feels like a parody
[3:36:20] <KaitlynnHere> I think the last line she says at the end of her side dialogue if you don’t get on her good side is “yeah... whatever”
[3:36:21] <%mikeriffic> @peachy996 oh what line is that, ive never seen the scene
[3:36:28] <James_Quivers> GUDDAMN BATARIANS
[3:36:34] <James_Quivers> TRYNA TAKE MUH JESSE
[3:36:43] <peachy996> It's not a scene more a throwaway news you hear in passing
[3:36:46] <%jillpilled> Kasumi gets phased out of existence for way too much of 3 :(
[3:36:47] <Jaysky> Zaeed is a cool rough BASTARD that just wants revenge and nothing more
[3:37:02] <morningmoondude> guys i think Pat is getting the Switch Pro for us
[3:37:06] <+jerkhov_> most characters don't matter in 3 because 3 sucked
[3:37:07] <peachy996> I forget how it goes 100% but it's along the lines of "We're all animals" or something
[3:37:15] <Jaysky> She was dlc only so it makes sense
[3:37:16] <%mikeriffic> Well whats the worst line
[3:37:18] <%mikeriffic> oh lol
[3:37:32] <tomahank18> A lot of 3 was cool. Until it wasn’t.
[3:37:42] <+InternetShis> Citadel DLC is good because you can slap Jacob for cheating on you, which I know none of you knew about because Jacob sucks
[3:37:44] <%jillpilled> Yeah suppose so, still why even include her outside Citadel then lol
[3:37:47] <peachy996> "Human or Alien, We're all animals" I think
[3:37:48] <Jaysky> Last 10 minutes of 3
[3:37:48] <ioci2112> @tomahank18 nah you can convince him you did the right thing with enough paragon points
[3:38:03] <+jerkhov_> it would still be the worst of the trilogy by a lot even if it somehow did have a good ending
[3:38:13] <KaitlynnHere> @internetshis he cheats on shepherd?! That asshole!
[3:38:20] <Jaysky> Eh
[3:38:20] <morningmoondude> if the ending didn't absolutely shit hte bed, I think everyone would go "yeah 3 wasn't as good as 2, but it's still one of the best franchises in gaming"
[3:38:42] <Jaysky> I liked a lot of missions from 3
[3:38:46] <SaltyAzteca> @morningmoondude This pretty much
[3:38:50] <ttc_lover> Pee pee poo poo
[3:38:57] <tomahank18> The Omega dlc isn’t great. And it’s super hard if you try to play too eaelt
[3:38:59] <tomahank18> Early
[3:39:03] <+Punchasaur> The animals line doesn’t even make sense because there’s no animals on the citadel
[3:39:10] <%G_Thunders> I never really got into the codex entries and deeper lore about ME, so when ME3 ended I was just like, “oh... okay, cool I guess.” And never thought much about it
[3:39:13] <+BigBruthaThunda> they took away so many dialogue choices in 3
[3:39:18] <SaltyAzteca> Pat is super lucky he never got into 3, he dodged a mental bullet
[3:39:18] <morningmoondude> there's a lot of things wrong/bad with 3, but also a lot of really good things. A downgrade but not a significant one.
[3:39:26] <peachy996> Is the Omega DLC still glitchy? Like Aria twirling around
[3:39:27] <+InternetShis> I'm just hoping they don't make ME4 and DA4 in Frostbite again
[3:39:28] <Jaysky> I dislike ninja man, I dislike the ending, but the gameplay is solid and story is still enjoyable.
[3:39:33] <%THOUTHPAW> 3 has a lot of good individual moments and some great dlc, but overall weak. the multiplayer was the best part
[3:39:34] <Lamokmok> @internetshis That would be me. I played 2 and 3 way too many times. I was like WTF Jacob?
[3:39:41] <ioci2112> I just cannot stand cerberus in any capacity, they went from being a rogue alliance cell in 1 to a galaxy spanning network with unlimited resources in 2 to a power capable of fighting against the council and the reapers at the same time in 3
[3:40:17] <morningmoondude> 3 was brave for letting you get cucked. A very forward thinking idea to make you get NTR'd
[3:40:19] <tomahank18> @javi9563 the illusive man has cool eyes though
[3:40:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Well you did kind of hand them a buncha shit in 2
[3:40:45] <KaitlynnHere> Yea him smoking a cigar in front of space always looked cool
[3:41:17] <%jillpilled> Martin Sheen tho, absolves all the war crimes
[3:41:20] <%YakumoYomi> True. In the process of dealing the Collectors, Shepard enables Cerberus to gather a bunch of resources
[3:41:29] <%jillpilled> PogChamp
[3:41:38] <Dabrikishaw> @Javi9563 I get that completely. I honestly feel like Mass Effect 2 would have been better off just making the TIM-Lead Cerberus in that game a new faction with a different name. Same with 3.
[3:42:02] <+天使42199> where is that let's go from
[3:42:07] <peachy996> Wanted to double check and the Kirrahe thing is tied to the extra objectives in Virmire. So you can kill whichever boring human you want
[3:42:17] <ioci2112> that still doesn't explain how they made the best ship in the galaxy even better in record time, have better intelligence than all the council races combined and revived the greatest hero in the galaxy when nobody else could do it in 2
[3:42:20] <tomahank18> Is the Normandy in 2 the same as the one in  3?
[3:42:20] <+InternetShis> I just remembered that while ME2 has Cerberus become a power capable of rivaling the Alliance in two years, Halo invented, used, and destroyed time travel in the First Strike novel so Chief could make it from Installation 04 to Earth in a month
[3:42:22] <KaitlynnHere> I thought the illusive man looked cool so I’d let him touch my peepee
[3:42:24] <+天使42199> r type Leo?
[3:42:32] <Blank9> @天使42199 Metal Slug
[3:42:42] <morningmoondude> The Normandy is completely different in every game
[3:42:43] <+天使42199> @blank9 ah okay
[3:42:46] <+天使42199> thanks
[3:42:55] <%G_Thunders> Did Andromeda add anything cool or interesting to the ME universe? Like, anything they could include in ME4 that would feel like it fits?
[3:43:09] <tomahank18> So what happens to the 2 Normandy that is superpowered by the end?
[3:43:15] <peachy996> @G_Thunders ehhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:43:17] <Psyramics> andromeda took place in another galaxy, so probably not
[3:43:21] <peachy996> hhhh uhhhhhh? mmmmm
[3:43:23] <morningmoondude> it looks cool,
[3:43:25] <peachy996> Not really
[3:43:37] <+InternetShis> @g_thunders The Alliance having the spending money to make a colony ship
[3:43:37] <morningmoondude> Andromeda is also 600 years in the future
[3:43:42] <Lamokmok> @g_thunders The Nomad's handling lol
[3:44:01] <morningmoondude> so they'll probably have a codec somewhere that references that they send hybernation pods to andromeda and that's it
[3:44:04] <%G_Thunders> Ah okay, thanks
[3:44:08] <KaitlynnHere> Did anyone here finish andromeda?
[3:44:10] <peachy996> It slightly upped the fertility rates for the Krogan and the Krogan raise their young instead of whatever they do now but thats it
[3:44:14] <+InternetShis> Everything on the colony ships is basically ME1 tech adjacent
[3:44:17] <peachy996> very slightly
[3:44:27] <peachy996> @KaitlynnHere Me.
[3:44:32] <%jillpilled> @g_thunders It did add some logs from Liara that'll probably come back later, idk though only watched someone play through it
[3:44:36] <ioci2112> @Javi9563 cerberus just sucks, a lot of the problems of me3 story started in me2, cerberus reviving shepard is a huge asspull and it only gets worse from there
[3:44:44] <%THOUTHPAW> andromeda was trying and failing too hard at trying to please every fan that it didnt add much at all
[3:44:48] <%twistedj3ster> @KaitlynnHere I was going to and then it refused to load any of my saves
[3:44:57] <$renegade_blade> I did one playthrough of andromeda at launch
[3:44:58] <Lamokmok> I finished Andromeda, 100%. It was okay to play, but the story was not great.
[3:45:00] <jackelzxaa> cerberus in me2 is such a cool feeling secret spy organization thingie
[3:45:02] <tomahank18> Remember how the Quarian ship in andromeda just completely disappeared because it was planned dlc
[3:45:05] <KaitlynnHere> @peachy996 and what did you think?
[3:45:06] <peachy996> I've been putting off a second run of Andromeda for ages
[3:45:10] <jackelzxaa> you got the cool cerberus armor with the white and the black and orange trim
[3:45:12] <jackelzxaa> and the money
[3:45:14] <+InternetShis> We never got quarians in MEA despite the sequel hook
[3:45:18] <jackelzxaa> me2 feels like you're hanging out with money
[3:45:20] <Dabrikishaw> @Javi9563 That first and third part is more of an issue with the silly opening that also killed Shepard. None of that makes sense no matter who's involved. As for the second part, it wasn't an information issue, the Council just do not want or care to act outside Council Space.
[3:45:29] <jackelzxaa> which is analogous to bioware and ea
[3:45:30] <Jaysky> I thought Shepherd bei g revived was cool and excused you in character to switch classes
[3:45:36] <peachy996> @KaitlynnHere Mediocre but not terrible
[3:45:38] <jackelzxaa> and then in me3 cerberus turns on them....like EA....
[3:45:38] <+jerkhov_> the only thing I know about Andromedia is it had nipples
[3:45:52] <tomahank18> @jerkhov_ nipples?
[3:45:55] <jackelzxaa> i don't think mass effect should have nipples
[3:45:56] <Reverend_Godshyne> I got to a point in Andromeda where I couldn't stand to hear any of the characters speak anymore
[3:45:58] <KaitlynnHere> NIPPLES?!?!
[3:45:59] <jackelzxaa> its too crude.
[3:46:04] <jackelzxaa> dragon age should but not mass effect
[3:46:07] <peachy996> Thing about the end of Andromeda is that it supports ME4
[3:46:17] <+jerkhov_> they realized half the people still playing were SFM audience
[3:46:28] <jackelzxaa> andromeda IS 4...
[3:46:28] <KaitlynnHere> Yea big titties should only stay in high fantasy
[3:46:28] <+jerkhov_> might as well put it in the base game
[3:46:31] <jackelzxaa> the next one is 5...
[3:46:36] <peachy996> At the end the Andromeda guys try to contact the Milky Way which is years in the future as we know it
[3:46:42] <Lamokmok> Funnily, it is the more ME1-like than 2 and 3. I hope they carry over some aspects of it.
[3:46:48] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Eundoling heart2Kigom tansy5Tuntun
[3:46:49] <+InternetShis> No, ME:A is a canon spin off
[3:46:50] <peachy996> So you could connect the two if you were so inclined
[3:47:09] <jackelzxaa> it's weird that liara is basically the mascot for mass effect because she can live long enough to be in the future generations of the series
[3:47:09] <%jillpilled> @kaitlynnhere agreed
[3:47:24] <jackelzxaa> she's also the only one that's normally not killable
[3:47:37] <peachy996> And yeah the DLC to Andromeda being canceled is super noticable
[3:47:41] <Dabrikishaw> Andromeda having the spirit of Mass Effect 1 was fine. Its main problem was copying Mass Effect, and parts of 2.
[3:47:41] <KaitlynnHere> High elves with their bobbing bewbs
[3:47:44] <+InternetShis> We have a week for EA to tell us that ME4 is ME4
[3:47:57] <+SIXminWHISTLE> how much longer is this break?
[3:48:01] <peachy996> There are empty spots in the MP character select that were probably going to be other races from the dlc
[3:48:02] <jackelzxaa> the main problem was the writing and characters were actually kind of just very bad
[3:48:05] <jackelzxaa> and the animation too
[3:48:08] <Captain_Joe1911> mimi006181 mimi006187 ?

[3:50:19] <tomahank18> Labs smell so bad when they get wet man
[3:50:23] <akitanito> gief just wants his own social media account
[3:50:24] <ioci2112> @Javi9563 maybe, but it would have more sense to me if the specters or the council revived shepard, or even if the alliance did it... cerberus is just a stupid idea, and also shepard KNOWS all the bad shit they've done in the past, but mac walters wrote the original cerberus mission in me1, and he became a main writer in me2 and me3, so now you're stuck with a terrorist organization with unlimited funding and resources because one guy wanted it
[3:50:25] <peachy996> They never copied Mordin when they made your pilot a Salarian
[3:50:34] <%jillpilled> Coopt your account to Gief, right now!

[3:51:29] <RubberFistFight> @Javi9563 The specters are space cops and the council is like a space UN with less teeth who would argue for a year before doing anything. How on earth would EITHER of them reviving shepard make any kind of sense?
[3:51:30] <wasdsf> big progress

[3:51:40] <akitanito> I don't even remember what happens
[3:51:40] <%SkyfireHero> SkyfireHero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! I watched an almost 3 hour video breaking down Ashley as a character and now I think she's a pretty good character, I still leave her on vermire though
[3:51:42] <%barrakuta371> I went to get dinner and came back right before you did. I'm eating ramen right now.
[3:51:49] <$Futurecity10> they are part of tali's quest
[3:51:50] <%JoshManVGH> They have wrex sass
[3:51:50] <Shatterthought> @Javi9563 I can't see the Alliance or the Council reviving Shepard, because they have morals and don't want to play God. Cerberus had no morals other than 'whatever it takes to make humanity the best'
[3:51:51] <%QueequegTheater> A bit I think
[3:51:51] <%Scottigecko> No, just go shoot some geth in the mako
[3:51:54] <televisedrevolting> Yes. Special dialogue for 2 I think?
[3:51:54] <%captain_thickthighs> @PatStaresAt I heard a rumor you might touch des2 again. any truth to that?
[3:51:59] <jackelzxaa> yeah the geth incursions have ambient stuff and tali stuff at the end

[3:54:48] <%QueequegTheater> I AM THE LAW, KIM
[3:54:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That eyebrow raise LUL
[3:54:52] <Dabrikishaw> @Javi9563 I agreed with you. That's why I said the Cerberus in 2 should have been a new organization instead, unrelated to Cerberus from 1 in anyway. As for why the Council didn't get Shepard first, originally Legion was going to be Shepard's first squadmate and he was the one who'd give Shepard's body to Cerberus. I don't know what else got left on the cutting room floor, but anything else would just be contributing to the feeling of forcing the player to work with Cerberus and their past bagga
[3:54:53] <KaitlynnHere> @lamokmok gotta motor boat first

[3:57:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> She was starting RIGHT at Shepard's dick
[3:58:01] <%captainpodock> Nope
[3:58:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> "I'm a Spectre" THAT'S THE REGULATION
[3:58:03] <KaitlynnHere> I wanna swipe my dick between her boobs like a credit card
[3:58:03] <%twistedj3ster> yeah, the threesome

[3:58:05] <%QueequegTheater> I'm a fucking Spectre, I literally exist to counter red tape
[3:58:12] <%Alazull> Alazull subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 19 month streak! 
[3:58:12] <RetributionP> specter what don't you understand
[3:58:15] <rekinom> Blue head pussy got me actin strange
[3:58:16] <TheAntiNihilist> he could bury you in bullets...bring on the paperwork
[3:58:17] <logothete2401> Spectres can literally just say fuck your regulations
[3:58:22] <+InternetShis> @james_quivers They live for a millennium
[3:58:23] <ioci2112> @Javi9563 exactly, shepard knows cerberus is completely fucked, and me2 gives no option to tells them to fuck off (even if you don't give them the collector base at the end they still get it somehow in me3), but marc walters wrote cerberus, and he wanted cerberus, so cerberus we got
[3:58:23] <RubberFistFight> @Javi9563 they're not "morally grey" though. They're AMORAL. There's a difference. They're like Section31 in Trek. They don't go full evil until ME3.
[3:58:24] <akitanito> booo, it doesn't ring again
[3:58:24] <Sunstalker> You've known her for 2 days max Sheperd D:
[3:58:28] <Samurai_Tchan> @Samurai_Tchan because its a possible treat
[3:58:30] <Parapattern> Only military people are trustworthy, you guys
[3:58:30] <%CatastropheCorvid> That chick had crazy Matthew McConaughey eyes.
[3:58:33] <Lamokmok> That underage blussy
[3:58:40] <peachy996> To get a peak15pass: You can narc, you can kill that asshole guard, you can double narc, or you can help a secrent narc
[3:58:41] <+Punchasaur> 👀
[3:58:46] <plaguedoctor_syan> We bang, ok?
[3:58:46] <%QueequegTheater> Oh my god her armor highlights her vagina
[3:58:50] <%captainpodock> @patstaresat have you started romancing Liara yet?
[3:58:56] <%QueequegTheater> Why does it have a landing strip
[3:58:56] <peachy996> All involve narc
[3:59:02] <Samurai_Tchan> A VIOLENT HANNAR
[3:59:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> The strongest ability specters have is the ability to say "No" in response to any requests.
[3:59:02] <RubberFistFight> @Javi9563 You can repeatedly act against Cerberus' interests and verbally bitchslap the main guy every time he tries to call you on it.
[3:59:03] <+FierceDeityGabe> Kreygasm
[3:59:06] <DSD24> Doesn't ME take place over the course of a few months?
[3:59:11] <%Treuan> God I thought their name was Merchant Opioid

[3:59:21] <Jaysky> We need Blasto
[3:59:21] <+InternetShis> I love and hate Noveria because of the back and forth bullshit encompassing beuracracy to a T
[3:59:24] <+jerkhov_> thought he was called merchant opioid
[3:59:24] <akitanito> shep the IRS agent
[3:59:30] <otakon17> ME takes place over the course of a few weeks I think?
[3:59:33] <KaitlynnHere> @samurai_tchan I was just about to say that
[3:59:35] <Samurai_Tchan> they dont use clothes
[3:59:36] <+InternetShis> Drug

[3:59:43] <SaltyAzteca> he honest
[3:59:44] <otakon17> not drug
[3:59:57] <Sigma_190_Beta> So it's a drug?
[3:59:59] <KaitlynnHere> How far up my ass does it have to go?
[3:59:59] <akitanito> so what about outside the port
[4:00:00] <otakon17> Hanar are honest to a fault
[4:00:07] <%jillpilled> @jaysky yep exactly
[4:00:11] <Sunstalker> So it's an alien dildo?
[4:00:12] <%captainpodock> The next mass effect protag should be a Hanar, could you imagine the renegade options?
[4:00:12] <Lamokmok> It's this one's porn collection

[4:00:40] <otakon17> Hanar are fun
[4:00:42] <peachy996> This is one option to narc
[4:00:42] <tomahank18> They are smuggling quads
[4:00:45] <Jaysky> @captainpodock Enkindle this

[4:01:06] <+InternetShis> Crimes are bills to the rich
[4:01:07] <Dabrikishaw> @Javi9563 That's meaningless hair-splitting man. The conversation was about why forcing the player to work with a faction that did that bad shit in the first place just constrained the writing to justify it. And it worked on you it seems.
[4:01:08] <LeotheHuntsman> AnCAp Hannar
[4:01:10] <peachy996> But I think you can do all the narcing in this area, you're free to do them all

[4:02:56] <KaitlynnHere> @psyramics I low key hate it when games put in a merchants own money limit
[4:03:03] <James_Quivers> Elonus, eh? Hmmmm

[4:10:13] <+jerkhov_> should've just bought endwalker
[4:10:22] <+AmericanSkidd> The package is just a subscription to Fornax

[4:11:01] <buhbuhboat> noo you should have given it to the krogan
[4:11:03] <akitanito> >250
[4:11:03] <peachy996> Good job Criminal

[4:11:22] <wasdsf> hannar grifter
[4:11:23] <%QueequegTheater> PARAGON AS FUCK
[4:11:28] <+Sebenoth> a whole 250
[4:11:29] <%AzureGale> LUL
[4:11:34] <arkv01> PunOko TIP YOUR WAITERS
[4:11:34] <%Agami23> the way these guys talk reminds me of the moonanites from aqua teen
[4:11:39] <Psyramics> kinda laughable amounts at this stage
[4:11:39] <+AmericanSkidd> money rewards in this game are a joke
[4:11:40] <akitanito> "thoughtful"
[4:11:43] <HeroToxiko> ANTE UP
[4:11:43] <+D00msDayDan> damn he's really breaking the bank
[4:11:44] <%MidnightBurst12> "damn, u rite"
[4:11:44] <James_Quivers> YOU GOT 6000 FROMA  RANDO HUSK
[4:11:45] <peachy996> That's nothing, should have narced
[4:11:47] <SaltyAzteca> wooooooooooow....husks literally give five figures
[4:11:51] <jackelzxaa> i like how if you betray opold he still sells to you
[4:11:56] <+InternetShis> This is specifically Mog Station that didn't list the sale, which I assumed was an error because the finalfantasyxiv site said it would be applied, but the Squenix shop has it applied
[4:11:57] <Dabrikishaw> You can come here first early game, which is why the amount is so low
[4:12:05] <%SataruYamate> he just gave you a nickel for that
[4:12:07] <%Mekhet09> Would Narcing give you anything.
[4:12:10] <+jerkhov_> it's a big hotel
[4:12:12] <%mikeriffic> they removed some walls
[4:12:13] <%Mekhet09> Other than I guess satisfaction.
[4:12:15] <Reverend_Godshyne> bless
[4:12:16] <%mikeriffic> to make it be more open looking
[4:12:18] <morningmoondude> wouldn't concrete get super cold?
[4:12:19] <%walternatorz> did pat just fall off a cliff?
[4:12:19] <twoto858> That one trailed for a bit
[4:12:20] <Jaysky> It's cause the barriers are removed
[4:12:20] <+Sebenoth> dont spend it all at once pet
[4:12:20] <James_Quivers> They removed a couple of dumbly palced walls, maybe that's why
[4:12:22] <jackelzxaa> yeah narcing gets you a shortcut to the garage pass
[4:12:23] <+bumpynavel> @patstaresat They did update it in legendary to make it feel more big and open.
[4:12:23] <rekinom> the amount is also low because they didn't update the quest for the new scaling, they would have had to re-record voice lines
[4:12:25] <%toolofparanoia> Lorrik is in the garage
[4:12:27] <+D00msDayDan> that was a really good sneeze
[4:12:30] <peachy996> Narcing will give you a pass to peak 15 from anoleis
[4:12:31] <Jaysky> It's open concept in this game
[4:12:31] <%mikeriffic> since the walls were there to help with draw distances on old hardware they removed them on new ones
[4:12:39] <thelonechris> Clint Howard
[4:12:40] <peachy996> You can do more fun things to get that pass
[4:12:40] <%MisterRockett> You're sneezing like that on purpose now, Pat.
[4:12:41] <akitanito> doesn't it just make it more empty
[4:12:42] <jackelzxaa> you can also betray the client or opold and get a hitsquad to try to ambush you once
[4:12:54] <+cafefunk> Bless you, i think
[4:13:01] <+cafefunk> That was a dramatic sneeze
[4:13:05] <+AmericanSkidd> I like this quest
[4:13:09] <akitanito> dull stone
[4:13:14] <%QueequegTheater> That's a terrible insult
[4:13:20] <peachy996> Asari in Yellow, you don't see that everyday
[4:13:24] <%Agami23> her eyes are so dead
[4:13:26] <Broken_Sonex> What's wrong with your face?

[4:14:35] <jackelzxaa> you can betray her

[4:24:05] <otakon17> just the ONE runs away
[4:24:05] <%QueequegTheater> They shot first

[4:24:09] <Drunkengen> shoulda just shot em
[4:24:09] <penitentpendant> Paragon Points AND Exp, WIN WIN!
[4:24:13] <Grandfather_Nurgle333> no peace only murder
[4:24:13] <%captainpodock> @queequegtheater I now want Bill Burr to voice a Turian
[4:24:14] <SaltyAzteca> Peace was NEVER an option
[4:24:15] <jackelzxaa> melt these men so thier families don't have a body to bury
[4:24:16] <%logoth_> W+M1
[4:24:17] <+NotaryRotary> Jesus LUL
[4:24:20] <Kidbizzaro> There still needs to be a shooting part
[4:24:22] <+senfood> Peace was never an option.
[4:24:22] <Profmcstevie> I certainly tried peace....not very well , but I did try
[4:24:23] <DefaultSettiings> murder is justified when they are in your way SeemsGood
[4:24:23] <otakon17> well you don't have to kill EVERYONE at least
[4:24:29] <+Daigrey> lol your shotgun is so stupid good
[4:24:30] <hat_under_bread> pace was never an option]
[4:24:30] <peachy996> No more Peace Only Polonium
[4:24:31] <$Faustgesicht> you just shot a guy for 7125 credits
[4:24:31] <%QueequegTheater> @captainpodock Fuck, that's strong
[4:24:33] <Dfreddy8> Garrus has a Pistol out
[4:24:34] <%MidnightBurst12> the single available attempt was made
[4:24:38] <HeroToxiko> was she already in combat mode when you started the conversation LUL
[4:24:38] <otakon17> he will shoot all the shots
[4:24:39] <malcobraaklynny> Do any of these people ever realize they're trying to fuck with a specter?
[4:24:40] <akitanito> this is a big office
[4:24:41] <%templar010> Kill them all Shephard its the only way
[4:24:52] <viewtifulr> Pat -Look what you made me do!
[4:24:56] <otakon17> YOU FINALLY GOT 12 CHARM
[4:24:58] <ammobasket> blood spilled only on the tiles
[4:25:00] <otakon17> when did I miss that
[4:25:01] <jackelzxaa> pat's almost at cap
[4:25:03] <RubberFistFight> mmm, all that delicious blue asari skin texture
[4:25:03] <jackelzxaa> it's 30 now
[4:25:17] <otakon17> >not leveling Liara's Electronics when she has the shittiest armor
[4:25:22] <+AmericanSkidd> suicide by specter is probably a thing
[4:25:29] <jackelzxaa> i can't believe that works for the frogger game i'm so upset
[4:25:29] <otakon17> she NEEDS the Shields man
[4:25:29] <logothete2401> At least there's no blood on the floor, because you disintegrated them
[4:25:31] <%Mekhet09> I feel like people don't respect thae fact that you're a fucking specter. A biotic spector. I hate that the game never acknowledges your choices. 3 is pretty bad as a biotic because the game thinks your a fucking soilder at all times. No cut scene biotic power uses.
[4:25:32] <jackelzxaa> i always did it the real way
[4:25:41] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind
[4:25:42] <%QueequegTheater> @otakon17 he has Garrus and Tali for Electronics
[4:25:56] <otakon17> I know he HAS them for Electronics
[4:26:00] <jackelzxaa> theres one cutscene in 3 that uses your biotics in a cutscene
[4:26:01] <otakon17> bu there's a reason Liara has it
[4:26:11] <+liquidzr0> SourPls
[4:26:14] <jackelzxaa> second floor pat
[4:26:15] <otakon17> she has the WEAKEST armor in the game and CANNOT upgrade to wear better or improve it
[4:26:18] <jackelzxaa> quinn's upstairs
[4:26:38] <otakon17> She **needs** Electronics to bolster her super weak armor or she dies in a few seconds
[4:26:40] <jackelzxaa> theres one cutscene in me3 with an engineer only interupt prompt
[4:26:47] <%logoth_> stop all the downloadin
[4:26:47] <Profmcstevie> I didn't catch the name of this planet earlier, where are we?
[4:26:50] <+GingerStrawhat> That's usually how it is with main quests
[4:26:51] <otakon17> aye
[4:26:55] <otakon17> and I'm aiming for it
[4:26:57] <otakon17> this is NOveria
[4:27:03] <Dunmarkh> she's got barrier @otakon17
[4:27:05] <jackelzxaa> time to do more kill!
[4:27:05] <peachy996> Now, Pat, Now.
[4:27:07] <+AmericanSkidd> oh, its you...
[4:27:08] <RubberFistFight> fucking polonium rounds, lol. Isn't that like a warcrime
[4:27:09] <akitanito> oh it's her again
[4:27:15] <peachy996> KILL HER
[4:27:15] <yourliteraldog> Polonium my faveriot poisin
[4:27:18] <otakon17> Barrier only last for a few seconds
[4:27:18] <jackelzxaa> time for kill
[4:27:21] <jackelzxaa> her face is different
[4:27:24] <jackelzxaa> they changed her eye shape
[4:27:31] <RubberFistFight> I'M SERGEANT TERRIBLE IMMOBILE HAIRCUT
[4:27:33] <+trackles_64> Corruption
[4:27:36] <+NotaryRotary> True
[4:27:38] <James_Quivers> GARRUS YOU LOVE BREAKING THE LAW
[4:27:38] <Reverend_Godshyne> I remember her being very blonde in the original
[4:27:39] <%peanutdot007> @RubberFistFight Can't be a warcrime if you're in space. just ask Janeway
[4:27:39] <%SkyfireHero> almost at the point where Pat can get infinite paragon or renegade
[4:27:40] <+NotaryRotary> LUL
[4:27:41] <yourliteraldog> Yeah Kill Dirty Cops
[4:27:41] <HeroToxiko> Is that a bodycount reference?
[4:27:46] <+trackles_64> All cops are bastards
[4:27:46] <akitanito> big regrets
[4:27:46] <SaltyAzteca> THERE SHE GOES
[4:27:48] <+jerkhov_> 2007 haircuts everwhere
[4:27:48] <%blutzwavedave> LUL LUL LUL
[4:27:48] <Grandnatics> MELTED
[4:27:49] <%logoth_> Barely one second after her threat and she's mulched
[4:27:49] <ioci2112> they tried
[4:27:50] <%mike2hands> LUL LUL LUL
[4:27:51] <%MidnightBurst12> atomized
[4:27:51] <Reverend_Godshyne> wow
[4:27:52] <+NotaryRotary> KEKW
[4:27:52] <FortuneEX> LUL
[4:27:52] <Dunmarkh> good fight
[4:27:54] <HyperionXV> raysL
[4:27:55] <%walternatorz> did she bounce?
[4:27:55] <jackelzxaa> man do enemies just not use biotics or tech skills on you in normal?
[4:27:56] <Gorshum> LUL
[4:27:56] <Enajy314> LUL
[4:27:57] <otakon17> and vaporized
[4:27:59] <%Puhff> DAMN LADY
[4:27:59] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt You finally got to kill her
[4:27:59] <$SGrim> got em
[4:28:00] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Wrex: Know what we do to dirty cops on mine?
[4:28:01] <%mike2hands> T pose into oblivion
[4:28:01] <CurrySauseBandit> I don't think she can hear ya
[4:28:03] <TheAntiNihilist> lol
[4:28:03] <%charp35> That went really poorly for them
[4:28:04] <+polothegreatest> well, that ended fast
[4:28:06] <+senfood> ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
[4:28:06] <peachy996> damn bro
[4:28:07] <otakon17> THE FIGHT LASTED LESS THAN THE CONVERSATION
[4:28:09] <RubberFistFight> @RubberFistFight good ol' Captain Undiagnosed Psychotic Disorder.
[4:28:10] <+Sebenoth> no body, no paperwork
[4:28:11] <%GarbageNirvana> ACAB
[4:28:14] <ammobasket> gonna be weird when they find her body here, huh
[4:28:15] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt and then he apologizes for calling Taiwan a country
[4:28:20] <%MisterRockett> is there a particular reason there's only aliens and human women here?
[4:28:26] <otakon17> oooh Energized Plating!
[4:28:27] <jackelzxaa> shepard's canon dialog: "Yes, i finally got to kill with gun."
[4:28:27] <+redthebaron> attacking the super cop that can just kill you seems dumb
[4:28:28] <Ultimatefool> Wow very hard hacking
[4:28:30] <otakon17> that's the GOOD shit Pat
[4:28:30] <$Futurecity10> Shame John Xena sucks now
[4:28:34] <yourliteraldog> Garus Killing Dirty Cops counters the fact he loves extra judicial murder
[4:28:35] <%blutzwavedave> That's what Xi did to him when he called Taiwan a country
[4:28:39] <+jerkhov_> because the matriarch
[4:28:41] <commander_ninja> Most firefights last less than the conversations
[4:28:43] <peachy996> You know why he's calling Taiwan country
[4:28:44] <jackelzxaa> shepard shoots them so hard they melt into green goo
[4:28:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is disgusting.
[4:28:50] <jackelzxaa> all of these people get turned into goo
[4:28:50] <RubberFistFight> @Futurecity10 yeah that was pretty terrible
[4:28:51] <otakon17> did he SHOOT behind him
[4:28:58] <otakon17> Polonium Rounds are the BEST ammo in the game
[4:29:08] <RubberFistFight> I AM ENTIRELY INNOCENT
[4:29:08] <%DianaTheAscian> oh yeah
[4:29:10] <otakon17> I think he was making a joke
[4:29:10] <+trackles_64> best side character on mass effect
[4:29:11] <RubberFistFight> ENTIRELY
[4:29:14] <dd44dostivei> IM ENTIRELY INNOCENT
[4:29:17] <+GingerStrawhat> Holy shit did you see your eyes go Black for a second there
[4:29:18] <jackelzxaa> theres unused mods in the game that are even better than polonium
[4:29:18] <yourliteraldog> I'm Innocent
[4:29:19] <$Faustgesicht> WHOA YOUR EYES
[4:29:20] <+D00msDayDan> entirely innocent
[4:29:23] <Ultimatefool> Holy shit Shepard's eyes just PHASED IN
[4:29:24] <jackelzxaa> the unused harpoon rounds are ridiculous
[4:29:27] <%Ranryu692> hubba hubba
[4:29:28] <+trackles_64> don't play coy with ne
[4:29:28] <yourliteraldog> I DIDNT DO ANYTHING
[4:29:29] <%RetroCop87> WANNA BANG SPECTRE
[4:29:32] <%QueequegTheater> Why is your face made of smudged plastic, Gianna?
[4:29:35] <+GingerStrawhat> LIke it was Black and Blue
[4:29:35] <jackelzxaa> theres mods to add all the unused stuff back into the shops and rotations
[4:29:37] <peachy996> More chances to Narc and Snitch
[4:29:37] <otakon17> oh man HARPOON rounds?
[4:29:40] <otakon17> what did THEY do?
[4:29:40] <%logoth_> Shepards eyes are phased in and his wrists are rotated on their axis
[4:29:42] <dd44dostivei> YES
[4:29:44] <$Futurecity10> Explosive rounds send fuckers to the moon
[4:29:46] <yourliteraldog> Depends on the target
[4:29:46] <Dunmarkh> explosion rounds are cooler
[4:29:47] <RubberFistFight> For what, Pat? WAR CRIMING?
[4:29:48] <+AmericanSkidd> they are really strong
[4:29:49] <$hattrick61> Y E S
[4:29:52] <jackelzxaa> explosive rounds are awesome but they overheat like a motherfucker
[4:29:53] <+trackles_64> Polnium rounds don't have a level X
[4:29:54] <buhbuhboat> explosive rounds make your weapons overheat in like 2 seconds
[4:29:56] <peachy996> they build heat up like crazy
[4:29:57] <CurrySauseBandit> Yes, but it doesn't matter right now.
[4:29:57] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Not for your shotgun, you'll kill yourself
[4:29:58] <+AmericanSkidd> soon
[4:29:59] <$hattrick61> Nextish planet
[4:30:00] <Dabrikishaw> I preferred Slowblind Rounds after a while, but Polonium rounds are def one of the best
[4:30:01] <%Puhff> Wow every human hates you here so far
[4:30:01] <viewtifulr> Now shepard can shot into her next Kappa
[4:30:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> Both sledgehammer and high explosive rounds are better than polonium
[4:30:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> Explosive rounds are considered the best in the game.
[4:30:07] <otakon17> Explosive Rounds are GREAT but they dont' stop Krogan Regen and on higher difficulties that shit is RIDICULOUSLY fast
[4:30:08] <jackelzxaa> you'll probably get them at peak 15
[4:30:09] <+Sebenoth> was this place on the verge and just needed shep as an excuse?
[4:30:12] <+jerkhov_> it's weird how the elevators still exist when they're so short now
[4:30:16] <%Ranryu692> my name is HOV
[4:30:16] <+GuilKato> polonium rounds would kill them a few days later
[4:30:16] <%RetroCop87> MY NAME IS HOV
[4:30:20] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt I believe never since the explosive rounds were that illegal mod? and they only show up if you keep the mod. Not actually sure
[4:30:22] <otakon17> plus you can only shoot like, 1 second with Explosive Rounds
[4:30:22] <DatAsuna> yeyeye parasini
[4:30:22] <malcobraaklynny> So do regular people know of Commander Shepherd, or at least the specter unit?
[4:30:23] <peachy996> So you better have damn good materials to support the explosive rounds
[4:30:28] <akitanito> "profitably"
[4:30:30] <+InternetShis> But are they like real ammo explosions or video game ammo explosions
[4:30:30] <otakon17> SHE'S A COP COP
[4:30:31] <jackelzxaa> putting explosion rounds on the pistol with 2 heat dampeners lets you use them with marksman for big damage and minimal overheat
[4:30:38] <ammobasket> mmmmm profit
[4:30:39] <HeroToxiko> There's no longer an "internal" to investigate tho LUL
[4:30:39] <%Ranryu692> @RetroCop87 I'm glad I wasn't the only one LUL
[4:30:42] <Dabrikishaw> Explosive Rounds are best on Shotguns and Snipers. Polonium is oone of the best on Assaults and Pistols
[4:30:45] <%Garthunox> SHE'S A SNITCH TOO!
[4:30:48] <RLT917> LUL
[4:30:50] <%jillpilled> Can't escape the IRS, even off-world monkaS
[4:30:55] <Samurai_Tchan> shes a man not a god
[4:30:56] <jorniev> SNICH SQUAD
[4:30:57] <otakon17> SO MUCH BACKSTABBING IN THIS GAME
[4:30:57] <+InternetShis> MAX SNITCH
[4:30:58] <Profmcstevie> ....I would totally keep a record cos I'm so evil and cool
[4:30:59] <+AmericanSkidd> I love how blunt she is
[4:30:59] <+trackles_64> space narc
[4:31:04] <yourliteraldog> It's okay to snitch on cops
[4:31:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> @malcobraaklynny They know about Spectres and that there's a human Spectre for the first time. Not Shephard themself yet.
[4:31:13] <akitanito> can't she just be lying to you about being IA
[4:31:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> In 2 and 3 Shephard becomes a household name.
[4:31:25] <HeroToxiko> internal investigations are the cops who cop on other cops
[4:31:33] <Dabrikishaw> The backstabbing adds to the roleplaying on Noveria. It's why this is one of my favorite partd of the game
[4:31:35] <otakon17> I love Gianna's complete switch in personality when this comes up
[4:31:37] <%logoth_> I like the pay me option
[4:31:37] <iosephe> PAY ME
[4:31:39] <RubberFistFight> Liara just standing there silently with her big blue space tits.
[4:31:39] <yourliteraldog> PAY ME
[4:31:42] <%DianaTheAscian> PAY ME
[4:31:43] <+RahuHordika> Fuck you pay me, lol
[4:31:43] <Dunmarkh> fuck you, pay me
[4:31:43] <%Mekhet09> PAY ME
[4:31:44] <%Monkeyweed21> PAY ME
[4:31:44] <otakon17> PAY ME
[4:31:44] <+Daigrey> PAY MEEEE!!!!
[4:31:45] <peachy996> You can also snitch to Anoleis about her and they'll kill each other
[4:31:46] <Drunkengen> POCKETS???
[4:31:47] <+jerkhov_> fuck you pay me
[4:31:53] <%jillpilled> Fuck you, pay me
[4:31:53] <SaltyAzteca> GIVE ME YOUR MONEY
[4:31:54] <+yoshkosh20> Liara looks like she hasn't slept in days.
[4:31:55] <otakon17> THE DE FACTO PAT CHOICE
[4:31:59] <Profmcstevie> Narcs stay together
[4:32:00] <otakon17> XD
[4:32:04] <RubberFistFight> yes
[4:32:04] <James_Quivers> DO IT
[4:32:06] <yourliteraldog> Cool
[4:32:07] <$Futurecity10> I do not recommend that
[4:32:08] <+D00msDayDan> pat's breaking character
[4:32:08] <jackelzxaa> yeah
[4:32:10] <jackelzxaa> thats a rela one
[4:32:11] <Grandnatics> Yes
[4:32:11] <%Mekhet09> Yeah.
[4:32:11] <buhbuhboat> yep
[4:32:12] <+InternetShis> Sounds like we know what we're doing next
[4:32:12] <%QueequegTheater> Pat that's super Renegade
[4:32:13] <peachy996> Yeah it's real
[4:32:13] <otakon17> NO
[4:32:13] <akitanito> sounds like a renegade outcome
[4:32:14] <%DJFakie> yes
[4:32:14] <Samurai_Tchan> play ball huh ?
[4:32:15] <otakon17> DON'T DO IT
[4:32:16] <RubberFistFight> but then you fuck yourself out of sidequests in 2 and 3 by doing it
[4:32:16] <jackelzxaa> its actually the funniest outcome
[4:32:18] <+Sebenoth> liara’s face is uncanny to me
[4:32:18] <morningmoondude> SAVE and do it
[4:32:19] <Grandnatics> It's kinda lame, cut to black
[4:32:19] <otakon17> ANOLEIS IS A SHITHEAD
[4:32:19] <Dabrikishaw> Liara probably HASN'T spelt in days
[4:32:21] <akitanito> wasn't there something similar in KOTOR1?
[4:32:23] <peachy996> You still get the pass
[4:32:24] <jackelzxaa> its the most renegade but its hilarious
[4:32:26] <otakon17> Parasini is at least decent with you
[4:32:26] <%mikeriffic> I like how pat is going paragon not cus he wants to be the good guy but because it provides maximum snitching oppurntunity
[4:32:29] <%maenos2> she shows up in 2 if you help though
[4:32:30] <peachy996> Save and test it out
[4:32:31] <+GuilKato> but Pat if you kill her she wont be around in 2 for the fun mission
[4:32:32] <%Monkeyweed21> you ruin side quests in later games
[4:32:33] <%Ynkubus_> A little renegade, as a treat
[4:32:33] <+YabbaTroll> doesnt she come back in 3 tho
[4:32:35] <Dabrikishaw> And yes you can snitch to Anolieas to get him and her killed
[4:32:37] <yourliteraldog> Renegade
[4:32:38] <%Garthunox> Save and do it!
[4:32:43] <+trackles_64> testify
[4:32:46] <+SirCacaPee> Hello PAT
[4:32:50] <Samurai_Tchan> "i'll anal layass" her
[4:32:58] <RubberFistFight> this guy shows up in a later game too as well .can't remember if it's 2 or 3.
[4:33:13] <%DJFakie> This convo is the infinite Paragon bug
[4:33:14] <Drunkengen> THANKS GARRUS
[4:33:15] <akitanito> sure crumpled easy
[4:33:23] <jackelzxaa> just walk past the lady when you go to the office and tell anoleis.  then you can get the pass from his office after they're both dead
[4:33:23] <Grandnatics> That was easy convincing

[4:39:08] <Grandnatics> *no one* was using the garage
[4:39:08] <jackelzxaa> theres a person to talk to and a tank you could have gotten in to shoot guns
[4:39:12] <+SimplesRock> What class is pat playing as?
[4:39:15] <akitanito> why is your mako conveniently there
[4:39:15] <+InternetShis> Didn't we fight Geth on Eden Prime?
[4:39:22] <+D00msDayDan> fortunately they had a mako prepped and ready for you
[4:39:23] <+SimplesRock> Adept?
[4:39:30] <%QueequegTheater> Only regular geth troopers

[4:39:38] <%justcallmebobplease> He will bark at GUN
[4:39:39] <RubberFistFight> borf

[4:39:41] <Alzero83> Emergency Food Fattening
[4:39:42] <Samurai_Tchan> OU
[4:39:49] <peachy996> The Slim ones get a stinger and a cutscene
[4:39:50] <+SimplesRock> @cheekybirb thanks!
[4:39:53] <notsoy> he speaks kinda quietly
[4:39:54] <Hillthugsta> This game has fewer enemies to fight than the original
[4:39:54] <%logoth_> "real" gun
[4:39:55] <Grandnatics> Your little hands don't count
[4:39:57] <%justcallmebobplease> Huh, finger gun check: Failed.
[4:39:59] <susukouhai> HE KNOWS
[4:40:05] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Or he knows you're not a threat
[4:40:08] <%kullumanati> Show gun
[4:40:12] <+trackles_64> Tokyo drift
[4:40:12] <yourliteraldog> Mako is a space lowrider
[4:40:13] <+Daigrey> he knows your hands aren't loaded
[4:40:15] <akitanito> can you fly off the cliff??
[4:40:16] <Samurai_Tchan> MUST BE sheppard in the tv
[4:40:18] <yourliteraldog> Prove me wrong
[4:40:19] <jackelzxaa> pat missed a very low importance npc that shows up after you kill those geth
[4:40:32] <Ultimatefool> Chat: MAY-ko or MAH-ko
[4:40:34] <Dunmarkh> it would be a good death
[4:40:36] <jackelzxaa> you can stand at the edge of the cliff and make yoru squad run off of it and die
[4:40:37] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater yeah i was gonna say for whatever reason it seems Gief can identify shep on the screen as striking a "threat pose" when he pulls his gun.
[4:40:37] <%Monkeyweed21> do it
[4:40:40] <RubberFistFight> no idea how
[4:40:41] <otakon17> you would in fact die
[4:40:43] <notsoy> MAH EH KO
[4:40:43] <yourliteraldog> Show me those hops
[4:40:51] <jackelzxaa> they'll just kill themselves over and over
[4:40:51] <Alzero83> Mah ko
[4:40:52] <+Sebenoth> May-ko
[4:40:56] <malcobraaklynny> I hate this section in the original
[4:41:04] <jackelzxaa> unless they patched that to add an invisible wall or something
[4:41:06] <otakon17> despite the Mako surviving EVERY FALL OFF A MOUNTAIN BEFORE THIS if you fall off THIS particular mountain you die instantly
[4:41:11] <otakon17> just run'em over
[4:41:16] <SaltyAzteca> Upgrade kit pat
[4:41:17] <yourliteraldog> Can't you hear the planet bleed it runs on MAKO
[4:41:21] <jackelzxaa> being able to aim down makes the mako so much better
[4:41:22] <SaltyAzteca> you passed it
[4:41:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> Why do they have a Mako on this planet? Aren't all their people literal business men?
[4:41:28] <otakon17> man I love using the Mako to run roughshod over Geth
[4:41:31] <%buffaloaff> buffaloaff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Just in time to watch pat bring back horrible flashbacks of the Mako....Thanks Pat...Pet babies, Kill Reaper, Profit.
[4:41:37] <RubberFistFight> @otakon17 i like how if the tiniest edge of ONE of your tyres touches lava it's instant death
[4:41:39] <%QueequegTheater> The Mako respects instant death pits
[4:41:46] <otakon17> they use it for transportation there @Sigma_190_Beta
[4:41:49] <peachy996> Gotta traverse the area somehow
[4:41:55] <otakon17> the Mako is just a combat model of the rover
[4:42:02] <%QueequegTheater> He downloaded more wan
[4:42:02] <rekinom> Did he unlock easy mode?
[4:42:04] <%QueequegTheater> *wam

[4:42:17] <+Sebenoth> dedodated wam?
[4:42:18] <Sigma_190_Beta> @otakon17 Fair enough... but why do they have the gun then?
[4:42:20] <otakon17> a Gethraffe
[4:42:22] <%Ynkubus_> Now park the mako on top of it
[4:42:29] <otakon17> *ahem* RAMMING SPEED
[4:42:30] <%Paperware> Lol that geth just hauling ass in the back
[4:42:36] <jbrowning134> I remember this part of the game being way too long and tedious
[4:42:51] <Ultimatefool> Amazing hacking minigame LUL
[4:42:51] <otakon17> PAT DO YOU EVEN LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING XD
[4:42:53] <%DianaTheAscian> wow
[4:42:55] <peachy996> Peak 15 is pretty slow
[4:42:58] <Jaysky> @jbrowning134 Likely due to the mako
[4:43:07] <otakon17> Peak 15 is pretty slow
[4:43:07] <akitanito> I hate how easy pat makes hacking look
[4:43:09] <RubberFistFight> @jbrowning134 same. i got my ass kicked a lot because PS3 controls for the mako were TERRRRIIIIBBLLLEEE
[4:43:12] <yourliteraldog> Jump
[4:43:14] <SaltyAzteca> Flashbacks of Outer Wilds
[4:43:15] <RubberFistFight> was better when i replayed it on PC

[4:43:19] <Dfreddy8> No, Pat is just blind
[4:43:21] <otakon17> what you said akitanito
[4:43:23] <RubberFistFight> interested to see how much more improved the new mako controls are
[4:43:30] <otakon17> he is the shiniest of pokemon
[4:43:31] <%QueequegTheater> @SaltyAzteca *Worlds
[4:43:31] <%MidnightBurst12> he's like a little hippo
[4:43:38] <otakon17> it means he's healthy
[4:43:38] <%AbnormalVoid> m6kwRember
[4:43:45] <Alzero83> So Gief is all bark and no bite?
[4:43:48] <akitanito> hippos are scary tho
[4:43:52] <otakon17> can you imagine Pat with an actual Pygmy Hippo?
[4:43:53] <%QueequegTheater> Bulldogs are a tank class
[4:43:55] <yourliteraldog> Mini Hippo
[4:44:06] <%DJFakie> Is Hitchhiker the positive idea of "Hire fans lol"
[4:44:06] <Shade075> But hioppos are super evil remember what Woolie said?
[4:44:12] <ChungusQuest> He is fat and he is sleek and he has nice burgers. Hormf hormf.
[4:44:15] <jbrowning134> hippos are like the most insane animal there is, even crocs wont fuck with them
[4:44:17] <Profmcstevie> Gief refused to spec into INT, he went all HP and DEF
[4:44:17] <otakon17> Bulldogs are tanks with good single target control
[4:44:21] <akitanito> no they aren't
[4:44:23] <%blastazoid00> Pat =  Orb, Gief = Cube
[4:44:27] <yourliteraldog> Chimps are more evil
[4:44:30] <%MidnightBurst12> baby hippos are adorable
[4:44:30] <SaltyAzteca> @QueequegTheater No no, WIlds. When he was with Elmo and didnt realize he crashed into the sun LUL
[4:44:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> They are not cute.
[4:44:32] <akitanito> they fling shit all over the place
[4:44:33] <otakon17> have you SEEN the baby hippo?
[4:44:36] <otakon17> dolphins are evil
[4:44:37] <morningmoondude> they are teh cutest
[4:44:40] <%QueequegTheater> They're cute until you see them pop a watermelon in their mouth like it's a fucking grape
[4:44:42] <alextrebeken> so morally ambigious
[4:44:45] <Alzero83> Gief has adopted Pats Coward tactics in a fight tho
[4:44:45] <otakon17> DOLPHINS are EVIL because THEY KNOW WHAT EVIL IS
[4:44:46] <%SirGO0SE> they can be drawn really cute for sure]
[4:44:46] <%Gloom_Tangerine> He has a lustrous coat!

[4:46:10] <James_Quivers> WHERE ARE YOOOOOOU AND I;M SO SOOOOOOOORRY
[4:46:11] <%JoshManVGH> Remember when Tinnitus was hearing loss "It's the last time you'll ever hear that tone again!"
[4:46:11] <%logoth_> Saint anger on blast
[4:46:11] <+Daigrey> listened to St. Anger on blast
[4:46:11] <danteftw20> Tinitus is a cruel mistress
[4:46:13] <+wizard_of_diamonds> u wat
[4:46:16] <SaltyAzteca> BIG GETH
[4:46:18] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt Fuckin weird how some people pronounce it "Tinni-Tus" instead of how you just did.
[4:46:20] <Psyramics> Pat is the guy on 4chan with 30000 plays of In The End
[4:46:23] <RubberFistFight> @jerkhov_ or doing factory work
[4:46:24] <peachy996> Don't turn your back on me
[4:46:24] <otakon17> good god you just blew that poor bastard away
[4:46:30] <Apolonm> Nickelback maybe
[4:46:32] <SaltyAzteca> wow
[4:46:33] <otakon17> Pat, just charges into battle
[4:46:34] <CheekyBirb> loading
[4:46:34] <akitanito> I like how that juggernaut is just a bigger geth
[4:46:37] <morningmoondude> you bullied that krogan
[4:46:42] <RubberFistFight> "User alert: Shit's on fire."
[4:46:43] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt so can you increase game difficulty or is that only selectable at start?
[4:46:44] <Doomstar16> So flipping cool.
[4:46:45] <otakon17> LOOK AT THE KROGAN REGEN
[4:46:46] <%QueequegTheater> Oh my god you're outdamaging the invincibility shield
[4:46:47] <%MidnightBurst12> this is just embarassing
[4:46:50] <+liquidzr0> WubTF
[4:46:50] <peachy996> So Krogan bleed blue huh
[4:46:55] <muXPerience> high quality listening interfaces pretty much negate the need for blasting music
[4:46:58] <%AzureGale> At least they're biohazard materials and not Resident Evil materials
[4:47:02] <otakon17> and it was STILL nearly outhealing the damage
[4:47:13] <%maenos2> aww
[4:47:19] <+D00msDayDan> Time for a trip to Hanoi
[4:47:20] <%JoshManVGH> Daaaw.
[4:47:21] <SaltyAzteca> Pat will make a cool dad I can see that
[4:47:23] <+GingerStrawhat> That's a lie pat why do you lie
[4:47:28] <+trackles_64> do you love chat pat?
[4:47:31] <Profmcstevie> When is peaches expected back, if ever Kappa
[4:47:31] <otakon17> you know i'm surprised there aren't more bio-weapons in ME, the team could have made some good horror stuff
[4:47:34] <$RealThiele> ewwwwwwwwww\
[4:47:34] <%JoshManVGH> Haha pat loves his wife! ... wait
[4:47:41] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt I never used headphones. I always just listen to me stuff out in the open and I used to work around aircraft APUs. No tinnitus
[4:47:42] <James_Quivers> MILLIONS OF PEACHES, PEACHES FOR ME
[4:47:42] <jbrowning134> Peaches are a 6/10 fruit
[4:47:42] <%AzureGale> But peach cobbler is delish
[4:47:43] <%Ranryu692> peaches are surpassed only by nectarines
[4:47:44] <Drunkengen> can eat a peach of hours
[4:47:47] <%chiluzza> i bet you also kiss her with that mouth too
[4:47:47] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[4:47:47] <+GingerStrawhat> They are good with Cottage Cheese
[4:47:48] <peachy996> I also hate Peach, I understand the irony of my name
[4:47:48] <otakon17> TURIAN ARMOR UPGRADE
[4:47:51] <Grandnatics> YEYEYEYEYE
[4:47:51] <yourliteraldog> What a nerd he loves his fiance
[4:47:52] <%LeiaSkynoober> You love your wife? That’s kinda gay tho
[4:47:53] <Dunmarkh> you got the good shit
[4:47:54] <otakon17> FINALLY
[4:47:56] <SaltyAzteca> Peaches the fruit are okay.
[4:47:58] <otakon17> NOT SLAP THAT ON YOUR SHOTTY
[4:47:59] <%Monkeyweed21> I COULD EAT A PEACH FOR HOURS
[4:48:01] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Oh Pat, you got some good armor too! The Predator M
[4:48:02] <otakon17> NOW*
[4:48:02] <akitanito> I don't like most of the peaches you can get in Canada
[4:48:04] <peachy996> Er peaches not Peach Saliva
[4:48:05] <%JoshManVGH> But what if you had millions of peaches?
[4:48:13] <dd44dostivei> i didn't know it was loot!
[4:48:18] <jackelzxaa> did they adjust the heat distribution on that
[4:48:18] <$Faustgesicht> that peach mountain dew is pretty fucking goood tho
[4:48:19] <peachy996> Oh this is a good time coming
[4:48:20] <%SaiyanShoto> Peaches are ok
[4:48:21] <jbrowning134> peaches come in a can
[4:48:22] <muXPerience> Good for turians?
[4:48:24] <jackelzxaa> i cnat see pat's meter
[4:48:26] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Bloody Turians...
[4:48:27] <%OrangeMDT> Cold canned peaches are top tier
[4:48:29] <otakon17> it's a BIG upgrade for Garrus
[4:48:32] <RetributionP> sound bite that and send it to peach with no context
[4:48:37] <muXPerience> @jbrowning134 I would certainly hope not
[4:48:39] <+Punchasaur> When you’re a teenager you probably won’t have high quality listening interfaces tho
[4:48:43] <akitanito> it's just a hand cannon at this point
[4:48:48] <%Ranryu692> It's stone fruit season and I am fucking HYPE
[4:48:59] <Grandnatics> NOOOO
[4:49:01] <jackelzxaa> frictionless materiels makes the gun overhead very rarely
[4:49:02] <Grandnatics> Max damage
[4:49:05] <Grandnatics> Max heat
[4:49:06] <jbrowning134> @muXPerience They were put there by a man in a factory down town
[4:49:06] <jackelzxaa> if you ahve two
[4:49:08] <Grandnatics> ragdoll
[4:49:13] <akitanito> but more shotsss
[4:49:14] <%QueequegTheater> Wrong gun
[4:49:25] <otakon17> OH don't forget to equip everyone with Health Regen parts for their armor, the enemies coming up ignore Shields and can end low Armor squaddies
[4:49:35] <otakon17> means the spread will be tigther
[4:49:58] <otakon17> Combat Optics is good stuff
[4:50:02] <+Punchasaur> I like tangerines. They’re me favorite
[4:50:11] <jackelzxaa> having two level 10 frictionless materiels does some work
[4:50:20] <otakon17> yeah Rail Extensions all day every day, the LOWERED fire rate actually helps a little
[4:50:25] <%ItalianWaifu> just take a pause and be solid
[4:50:28] <peachy996> 4 shots it is
[4:50:58] <otakon17> it is
[4:51:07] <Dunmarkh> It's like amazon
[4:51:43] <jackelzxaa> make a manual save just in case any elevator here breaks
[4:51:43] <otakon17> think about it, if you fire slower it means heat accumulates more slowly
[4:51:52] <SaltyAzteca> BACK TO THE PIT
[4:51:54] <peachy996> Beautiful
[4:51:55] <%DJFakie> RIP City
[4:51:56] <sweatch0> wow
[4:52:01] <%QueequegTheater> Yeah that's how shotguns work
[4:52:01] <jackelzxaa> i haven't heard of any elevators in LE breaking but it happens sometimes in og me1
[4:52:03] <peachy996> geth go boom
[4:52:03] <yourliteraldog> Vanguard dosen't have the charge abilty in 1 right?
[4:52:04] <RedPlasticCup> cutscene time

[4:53:05] <jorniev> MORE DAMAGE
[4:53:07] <+D00msDayDan> It’s definitely not the zerg
[4:53:10] <yourliteraldog> Orson Scott Card demands those space bugs be more homophobic
[4:53:11] <+GingerStrawhat> I really like the Rachni but I will acknowledge that they are just a big Flood Rip off
[4:53:11] <ChungusQuest> If you do 1 of each can you still get 4 shots?

[4:56:30] <%Treuan> Parenting is a thankless job
[4:56:39] <otakon17> he got it confused with marshmallow fluff
[4:56:42] <%shurtal> Why does Elmo taste so good
[4:56:44] <ChungusQuest> Let's be fair, Pat: have you tried the taste of Elmo yet? At least 50% of your household enjoys it.
[4:56:44] <%peanutdot007> Saturn Consuming His Son
[4:56:49] <zenith0111> Is Elmo fur just... delicous?

[4:57:16] <yojohny> Pussy

[5:00:19] <%JobbedBone> I like those voices you hear at airports. its always somebody who sounds 50 something
[5:00:20] <%JoshManVGH> Thats Dr Chakwas
[5:00:21] <RubberFistFight> Carloyn Seymour is Doctor Chakwas
[5:00:22] <peachy996> I didn't know she was in MK annihilation
[5:00:24] <+D00msDayDan> Just keep staring at liara
[5:00:26] <$Faustgesicht> She's Diane Michelle
[5:00:33] <%maenos2> Diane Michelle pat
[5:00:39] <%Monkeyweed21> lol Pat's phone is twice as big as his hand
[5:00:57] <%QueequegTheater> Pat why did you get an adult-sized phone
[5:01:04] <$Faustgesicht> Natalya from Diablo 2?
[5:01:09] <peachy996> just one of those voices
[5:01:12] <%JobbedBone> so it looks like a wide screen TV
[5:01:16] <+pre10cious_1> Pat just got small hands
[5:01:24] <+black_pariah> she was in days gone
[5:01:29] <thelonechris> One of these days, Pat's going to get his phone and it's just going to be a massive slab compared to him
[5:01:32] <otakon17> Anahi Bustillos
[5:01:54] <%Treuan> We have to nuke the site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
[5:01:56] <%JoshManVGH> She was Zam Wessel is Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds.
[5:02:04] <otakon17> at least Mira didn't go full Red Queen
[5:02:20] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt this voice actress is also Dr Warren and the Destiny Ascension Commander.
[5:02:21] <peachy996> Hot Labs in Cold Place
[5:02:22] <+D00msDayDan> The HOT labs
[5:02:23] <%JobbedBone> oh god the kids don't know widescreen, is anything 4:3 anymore? LUL
[5:02:24] <RubberFistFight> in this game.
[5:02:49] <otakon17> Hot Labs mean that they carry out live experiments
[5:02:54] <peachy996> Are you sorry? Are you really?
[5:02:55] <%DJFakie> It's not a power failure, it's an "unplanned outage"
[5:03:04] <peachy996> You don't sound very genuine
[5:03:07] <+Awesomegearthree> Pat, Mira’s VA is the same as the opening VA of the tram PA in Half Life. That or just very similar.
[5:03:09] <otakon17> BLUDGEON HER
[5:03:15] <ammobasket> but how does that make you *feel*?
[5:03:19] <morningmoondude> SMT5 is out on November 11

[5:04:37] <%blastazoid00> Release date leaked from their website
[5:04:41] <Mattais88> SMT5 realease date? doubt.
[5:04:42] <brovietto> there's a date for SMTV?
[5:04:43] <otakon17> you're re-enablin the landline
[5:04:44] <+jerkhov_> Why announce it before the E3 Direct?
[5:04:48] <muXPerience> Rachni getting hit with biotics looks pretty cool
[5:04:49] <peachy996> Bless the Explosive Rounds
[5:04:51] <+senfood> WAIT WHAT
[5:04:53] <+D00msDayDan> bullshit SMT5 isn't real
[5:04:58] <%Garthunox> @Monkeyweed21 TWH3?
[5:05:02] <%QueequegTheater> Oh goody SMT I can't wait to pay $60 to get the shit kicked out of me in the tutorial area like the last game
[5:05:04] <Shade075> Wasnt SMT5 supposed to be released on the WiiU or something
[5:05:07] <morningmoondude> they put it on their japanese website by accident lol
[5:05:10] <AoG_JarlRaven> Smh at the smt5 bait
[5:05:24] <$Faustgesicht> Like how they just tell you it's the Rachni
[5:05:27] <%Chichen> @QueequegTheater thats the best part!
[5:05:28] <+lucaflowe> Oh shit it actually did leak, November 11th
[5:05:34] <peachy996> Peak 15 and the tale of USER ALERT
[5:05:36] <%Monkeyweed21> @Garthunox Total Warhammer 3
[5:05:37] <morningmoondude> nah, SMT5 was revealed in that big Switch conference 4 and a half years ago
[5:05:44] <%walternatorz> OR GUN
[5:05:51] <%dekkitout> Big dump time
[5:05:53] <zenith0111> Daddy I need to shit!
[5:05:56] <akitanito> probably going to be pooping elmo fur
[5:06:05] <%AzureGale> Poop brek
[5:06:10] <%coreyyotto> poop isn't tos
[5:06:15] <otakon17> see the one place where the game screws up
[5:06:24] <otakon17> is TELLING you that the things you're fighting are Rachni
[5:06:31] <otakon17> they shouldn't have said what they are
[5:06:56] <infiniteFERN> oooh good point
[5:07:04] <peachy996> Also you can spoil yourself on the rachni if you do Kahoku's mission
[5:07:17] <otakon17> just put in the nameplate "unknown lifeform"
[5:07:29] <otakon17> and the reveal is a bit better afterwards
[5:07:38] <peachy996> ME1 oddly spoils itself
[5:07:43] <otakon17> surprised they didn't change that in the Legendary actually
[5:07:53] <otakon17> it does at times
[5:07:54] <infiniteFERN> makes sense
[5:08:02] <peachy996> Expat will flat out tell you about Feros and Noveria before you go to them
[5:08:11] <otakon17> it's not a perfect game by any means but GOD I love the universe it sets up
[5:08:29] <$hattrick61> reload
[5:08:30] <peachy996> yeah its a great universe
[5:08:36] <infiniteFERN> hell yeah
[5:09:08] <jbrowning134> Its been a long time since I played, but was ME1 really short and had very little content?
[5:09:24] <peachy996> The news stories in 2 had so much left unseen
[5:09:28] <infiniteFERN> no
[5:09:54] <peachy996> Like we were in the process of having a new species until the Reapers showed up
[5:09:56] <otakon17> oh man you mean the little things in the Cerberus Network?
[5:10:06] <peachy996> Yeah
[5:10:11] <peachy996> Stuff like the Raloi
[5:11:04] <Goraka91> Raloi the birbs?
[5:11:16] <peachy996> yeah
[5:11:48] <Ner234> I had to leave for a bit. Is the stream ending or is he just on another break?
[5:11:56] <peachy996> The come 3 the reapers show up and they cut all contact and destroy their spacefaring tech so the reapers don't come for them
[5:12:02] <%AzureGale> Yeah, it's a break
[5:12:06] <%QueequegTheater> Break
[5:12:19] <Ner234> cool thanks
[5:12:48] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> smt v release date leaked poor atlus LUL
[5:12:59] <+cafefunk> I need an opinion: if i play through the dmc games, should i skip 2 and the remake?
[5:12:59] <+docsocks> docsocks subscribed with Prime. 
[5:13:12] <%AzureGale> yes
[5:13:17] <allanmiri> YEs
[5:13:17] <%GinAndRoses> yes and yes
[5:13:26] <AoG_JarlRaven> Where are you finding the leaked date
[5:13:26] <marvel877> remake? you mean reboot? yes and yes.
[5:13:30] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> yes and no :)
[5:13:38] <+RenoDeGeneric> You can skip 2, DmC is a fine action game, just a bad Devil May Cry
[5:13:40] <marvel877> wario64
[5:13:55] <commander_ninja> Yuji Naka no longer employed at squenix. RIP Balan Wonderland
[5:14:05] <%Ynkubus_> Just read a synopsis of 2 unless your really curious
[5:14:06] <AoG_JarlRaven> I play 2 for the cool Dante outfit
[5:14:14] <theredfox930000> these guys know how to dance
[5:14:39] <%StrawberryPantsu> Play though DMC2 and DmC so you can appreciate the games that came out before them and after them.
[5:14:49] <+RenoDeGeneric> @cafefunk Also if you can, play the Definitive Edition of DmC, or mod the PC version into it. It's significantly better.
[5:15:12] <+Punchasaur> People need to stop giving Yuji Naka money
[5:15:17] <TomFrancis_> is he done for the night?
[5:15:34] <%AzureGale> No, just a break
[5:15:40] <malcobraaklynny> I never played ME 2 or 3; could someone explain why EDI is allowed to exist despite AI’s being illegal by the Citadel?
[5:15:45] <theredfox930000> dmc definitive edition is pretty fucking good
[5:15:47] <he1lhydra> dog had to poop
[5:16:18] <HeroToxiko> endings are a raid usually
[5:16:22] <%LeiaSkynoober> @malcobraaklynny In 2, you're not working with the council
[5:17:01] <infiniteFERN> that's a good non-spoiler way to put it
[5:17:07] <peachy996> in 3 its not handled well
[5:17:25] <peachy996> everyone just pretends she's joker's assist bot
[5:17:25] <allanmiri> A lot of things in 3 aren't handled well.
[5:17:31] <+black_pariah> @malcobraaklynny they tell everyone who asks that shes a vi in a shell meant to help joker
[5:17:37] <commander_ninja> EDI was created by a terrorist organization. They don't care about laws
[5:17:37] <Redmannasah> @peachy996 That's like the tag line for all of 3 LUL
[5:17:37] <peachy996> Ha

[5:18:17] <%JoshManVGH> The psycho neighbors that kept fucking with paige?
[5:18:18] <akitanito> was gief pooping right in front of them
[5:18:18] <%templar010> ooooof

[5:18:23] <%mikeriffic> No one won
[5:18:23] <marvel877> NICE
[5:18:26] <+holyxgrale> They chose the renegade option monkaS
[5:18:27] <%TheotherKristian> Classic Neighbour stuff
[5:18:28] <%Taisuru> Vobuocle
[5:18:28] <allanmiri> No one wins in devorce.
[5:18:28] <otakon17> lol what
[5:18:29] <ChungusQuest> The lawyers always win in the end
[5:18:30] <+Punchasaur> FrankerZ

[5:18:39] <acridpaladin> aww its no fun if its just a yelling divorce
[5:18:39] <+CursedNobleman> DESTROOOOOOOOOOOOYED
[5:18:42] <otakon17> BIG STREET FIGHT, get the popcorn time?
[5:18:48] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt see there's only a finite amount of marriage energy in the world. Because you and paige are tying the knot, then energy has been extracted from elsewhere, and they were the closest available reservoir of it.
[5:18:50] <%Taisuru> You should have joined in as a striker
[5:18:52] <%JoshManVGH> The person with the house won, it seems
[5:18:52] <%ssjklyco> the one who doesn't get the kid wins
[5:18:53] <plaguedoctor_syan> The Asshole guy that keep bothering Paige?
[5:18:57] <morningmoondude> did gief pee on one of them?
[5:19:01] <CrimsonGargoyle> @arkv01 LUL
[5:19:02] <%DJFakie> Did you consider shouting "Worldstar"?
[5:19:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> Not as awkward as one of them finding out the reason for the divorce
[5:19:07] <%AzureGale> SO HOWS THE WEATHER
[5:19:08] <otakon17> No items, all cursing, final destination
[5:19:08] <%justcallmebobplease> Drunken screaming, or 'just' screaming?
[5:19:08] <$Faustgesicht> Who was outside?
[5:19:10] <malcobraaklynny> Oof
[5:19:13] <theredfox930000> pat stop talking about your thickness
[5:19:15] <%chiluzza> @PatStaresAt  was it about dipping food in the pool water? i did watch someone get into a fight over that
[5:19:21] <%YakumoYomi> @DJFakie LUL
[5:19:23] <akitanito> and soon there will just be one of them
[5:19:26] <allanmiri> Hey, they're the ones who decided to argue out in public so fuck them.
[5:19:29] <CrimsonGargoyle> lul
[5:19:31] <morningmoondude> you should've offered them to pet the dog
[5:19:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[5:19:37] <morningmoondude> then they'd still be in love
[5:19:38] <acridpaladin> ohyea was it the angery old guy or just a randim neighbour?
[5:19:40] <+holyxgrale> You should've saved their marriage you have enough charm
[5:19:42] <%NateyBeak> BIG STRETCH!
[5:19:48] <HeroToxiko> LUL
[5:19:55] <+catman042285> elmo stream!!!
[5:19:57] <%DJFakie> Why didn't you Paragon them Pat
[5:19:59] <Srthunda> oh so its those ones
[5:19:59] <CheekyBirb> guess paige knew what was up, lmao
[5:20:06] <morningmoondude> will their divorce be in ME2?
[5:20:07] <%AzureGale> Cat want attention
[5:20:09] <%ssjklyco> you should buy their house and fuse it into yours
[5:20:10] <%Divryne> Where was your Paragon interrupt Pat? You could have saved the marriage.
[5:20:17] <+holyxgrale> monkaS
[5:20:20] <%JoshManVGH> Now you may only ever meet one of them
[5:20:21] <GiefHoward> they'll run it back
[5:20:22] <allanmiri> That bad?
[5:20:27] <+Rekinsinn> what was loud? I just got here
[5:20:28] <akitanito> it's not like they are shooting
[5:20:37] <%AzureGale> +2 reputation
[5:20:37] <+holyxgrale> OH no
[5:20:41] <allanmiri> Oh GOd!
[5:20:41] <AoG_JarlRaven> What happened?
[5:20:44] <Sp3ctre48> oh
[5:20:48] <Grandnatics> That depends on the part of Montreal tbh
[5:20:49] <%YakumoYomi> It's after midnight, after all
[5:20:55] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt Was it in English or French?
[5:20:57] <SaltyAzteca> oof yes. the whole block hears it
[5:20:57] <+derrigible> yeah I grew up listening to that kind of yelling
[5:21:00] <%Monkeyweed21> The kind that reminds me of my childhood
[5:21:00] <Profmcstevie> Whole neighbourhood gets an earful huh
[5:21:01] <AoG_JarlRaven> No?
[5:21:02] <akitanito> throat's gonna hurt the next day
[5:21:06] <%captainpodock> and you get the feeling that of something goes down your the only other person. that could do something
[5:21:08] <allanmiri> I think Liara was just sending signals on the elevator...
[5:21:16] <Grandnatics> Scram rail is next level of extended rail
[5:21:18] <Grandnatics> but worse
[5:21:18] <+InternetShis> It scrams
[5:21:18] <tanarath> I mused what happened, people being jerks outside?
[5:21:18] <%ssjklyco> broken marriages, live on stream
[5:21:21] <otakon17> lookit dat floof
[5:21:23] <%DJFakie> Scram Rail is rad is what it is!
[5:21:24] <peachy996> So you ever realize how Liara looks terrible in nearly all of the armors in Mass Effect 1
[5:21:25] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt thanks to the construction of the street I live on, when the people directly across from my house have one of their many loud, 2 am domestics, it literally sounds like it's coming from the front yard directly infront of the bedroom window. It's the absolute fucking worst and I hate it.
[5:21:36] <tanarath> @patstaresat better thing for damage
[5:21:46] <otakon17> @peachy996 it's that weird belly the armor gives her
[5:21:54] <allanmiri> Is this version worth playing despite the shit ending of 3?
[5:21:58] <+InternetShis> God that sound is awful
[5:22:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> I like how the enemies are named before Sheperd knows what they are
[5:22:06] <otakon17> Scram Rail is a better version of the Rail Extension
[5:22:08] <+darthvader438> Is this mass effect 4?
[5:22:20] <malcobraaklynny> Does the Legendary Edition make the autosave system more reliable in ME1?
[5:22:26] <+holyxgrale> put the boom rounds in PogChamp
[5:22:26] <CrimsonGargoyle> @goose_attack_almanac databases baybeee
[5:22:27] <otakon17> this is ME1 Legendary Edition
[5:22:32] <%blastazoid00> psaElmo
[5:22:36] <AoG_JarlRaven> This is Mass Effect: Will Return
[5:22:41] <otakon17> WHY IS LIARA USING AN AR?!
[5:22:48] <KingSpunf> What does New Zealand have to do with Mass Effect?
[5:22:51] <%templar010> Yeah its spotty still
[5:22:57] <$renegade_blade> Did Pat forget that he can use carnage to purge the overheat from the shotty?
[5:23:00] <allanmiri> Is it worth playing despite 3's shit ending? Question for pretty much everyone.
[5:23:13] <allanmiri> This version I mean.
[5:23:16] <%Monkeyweed21> give Liara a good pistol @PatStaresAt
[5:23:40] <otakon17> well Garrua has PROFciENCY in AR's at least
[5:23:45] <otakon17> Liara can barely use a damn pistol
[5:23:47] <%blastazoid00> Is it normal in ME1 that everything gets 1-shotted?
[5:23:49] <malcobraaklynny> I wonder how it would feel to rub your fingers in asari hair-tentacle things
[5:23:54] <+ClamityArt> Popping in for the first time. You rocking Vanguard?
[5:23:55] <otakon17> that muted "wow"
[5:24:00] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you have Combat Exoskeleton equipped? You just got one
[5:24:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> Patguard
[5:24:10] <otakon17> @malcobraaklynny it's probably smooth and cool to the touch, like touching a snake
[5:24:12] <+ClamityArt> It's so busted. Love Vanguard.
[5:24:13] <tanarath> They used to @patstaresat
[5:24:15] <+senfood> whow
[5:24:28] <Sigma_190_Beta> Missed a crate.
[5:24:29] <ChungusQuest> missed a box
[5:24:30] <allanmiri> It's a fun sounding shotgun at leasat.
[5:24:39] <%StrawberryPantsu> Cause it wasn't
[5:24:39] <%Monkeyweed21> missed a locker
[5:24:39] <$Faustgesicht> locker
[5:24:40] <+ClamityArt> It's way worse in 2 then gets good in 3 again
[5:24:43] <otakon17> in the original game at close range Explosive Rounds at point blank range would cause you damage
[5:24:48] <+D00msDayDan> i don't think i even ever played vanguard in 1
[5:24:48] <%Taisuru> psaPorgmo
[5:24:59] <wasdsf> it rocks in 2 wtf are you talking about
[5:25:02] <%maenos2> worse?  wtf no it isnt
[5:25:02] <wasdsf> the dash is awesome
[5:25:02] <+CursedNobleman> i thought vanguard was cool in 2
[5:25:05] <DSD24> Dash is great in 2
[5:25:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Its amazing in 2
[5:25:11] <+Punchasaur> The locker
[5:25:13] <allanmiri> How can Bioware make something better and then worse?
[5:25:14] <televisedrevolting> I just finished 2 and thought it was alright
[5:25:16] <chancho4tierra> is great in 2
[5:25:18] <RetributionP> one guy
[5:25:18] <%maenos2> vanguard improves each game
[5:25:18] <$hattrick61> yeah but you lose barier
[5:25:19] <+InternetShis> One Guy
[5:25:21] <%Taisuru> Vanguard is amazing in 2
[5:25:24] <DatAsuna> the weapon system in 2 sucks and is undermined by 2's much worse sprint and turn speed
[5:25:24] <AoG_JarlRaven> Vanguard went from bottom tier to best
[5:25:24] <%sunsetdisc0> Vanguard only ever gets better tf
[5:25:27] <otakon17> no, it's BETTER in 2
[5:25:27] <%AzureGale> Engineer is the best
[5:25:28] <+CursedNobleman> I ARGUE AND MAD.
[5:25:28] <+SimplesRock> Nah it’s good in 2 still
[5:25:30] <%ssjklyco> Chat is divorcing now
[5:25:34] <%mikeriffic> You are only stuck with a few guns in 2
[5:25:34] <otakon17> you get the Biotic Charge
[5:25:35] <Sunstalker> Two's fine, just it's hard on Insanity because you're constantly in the open after using your charge so you take a beating
[5:25:35] <%blastazoid00> I only played 3 and vanguard was rad in 3
[5:25:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Infiltrator and Vanguard just get better every game
[5:25:37] <CrimsonGargoyle> dunno about good or not, but vanguard is hella fun throughout the whole trilogy
[5:25:37] <%JoshManVGH> Teleport boom, but Sentinel was also rad.
[5:25:38] <%mikeriffic> SMGs i dont like
[5:25:39] <$Faustgesicht> it's rad in 2, especially when you get the CLAYMORE
[5:25:40] <Explodincatz> reee
[5:25:40] <%maenos2> you don't need barrier you become a biotic wrecking ball
[5:25:41] <infiniteFERN> i remember it being great in 2 and 3, maybe it's related to the legendary edition?
[5:25:41] <+D00msDayDan> lose barrier, gain sickass biotic charge
[5:25:43] <televisedrevolting> Having just gotten into 3, it is back to absolutely nuts.
[5:25:45] <DatAsuna> vanguard is just okay in 2, but too jank to work as intended
[5:25:46] <+catman042285> I played solider
[5:25:47] <+InternetShis> @patstaresat One Guy
[5:25:48] <Ner234> D: Pat
[5:25:49] <+ClamityArt> Maybe I was wrong. Dash got me blasted to hell in 2 most the time.
[5:25:50] <%SirGO0SE> :O
[5:25:50] <faiz_saad> SMOrc fight
[5:25:53] <fritz_dacat> Rada Rada mad
[5:25:53] <%captainpodock> @allanmiri absolutely, the ending sucks but theres alot of interesting stuff
[5:25:55] <%JoshManVGH> Shield like barrier but also explodes.
[5:25:56] <otakon17> like if they managed to make the Biotic Charge in ME1 that would be AMAZING
[5:25:56] <%dekkitout> It has been a difficult mating season for Bird-Man
[5:25:57] <allanmiri> Is this the bug monster mission? This was my favorite back in M1 original.
[5:25:59] <Srthunda> I only played 3 hello chats who is right in this argument
[5:25:59] <CheekyBirb> oh so pat is the reason for the divforce Kappa
[5:26:02] <RubberFistFight> @malcobraaklynny d'ya think that scale texture goes all the way down?
[5:26:05] <DatAsuna> It's only in in 3 where vanguard becomes what it should be
[5:26:07] <allanmiri> @captainpodock Thanks you.
[5:26:08] <peachy996> I think the dash in 2 is great but the general movement is sluggish
[5:26:08] <otakon17> Garrus is YOUR TECHMAN
[5:26:17] <peachy996> Once you get to run it gets better
[5:26:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Vanguard and Infil get better every game
[5:26:24] <Sp3ctre48> No biotic class is good in ME2
[5:26:25] <Wolfstriker121> its fun for me in 2
[5:26:26] <DatAsuna> The dash is great but other parts of 2's combat drag it down
[5:26:28] <James_Quivers> it's not optimal but it's hella fun
[5:26:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> I would have loved a moment in Mass Effect where everyone's translators just stop working. And you have to listen to Garrus chirp and screech and click about how crime is bullshit
[5:26:32] <Alzero83> Charge in 2 is Really good
[5:26:34] <%Rumbutt> Vanguard isn't good in 2 but 3 makes up for it
[5:26:35] <televisedrevolting> For 1=Busted, 2=Alright, 3=NUTS
[5:26:35] <DSD24> Infiltrator is the best class
[5:26:36] <wasdsf> it dash it good
[5:26:36] <+ClamityArt> I'm sorry Pat I didn't mean to divide us
[5:26:38] <DatAsuna> And 1 move alone doesn't make it good
[5:26:39] <%MidnightBurst12> It's fun
[5:26:40] <Sunstalker> It is but it can be a bit jank since charge is new and it's ME combat, let's be honest. It's fine.
[5:26:41] <Sp3ctre48> Inflitrator
[5:26:44] <%Ranryu692> Balan Wonderworld was so bad that Yuji Naka no longer works at Square Enix LUL
[5:26:45] <%DJFakie> Adrenaline Rush is really good IMO
[5:26:45] <%AzureGale> Every biotic class is good in 2
[5:26:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> I liked Infiltrator
[5:26:45] <%Taisuru> psa1guy
[5:26:46] <DSD24> Infitrator
[5:26:46] <DatAsuna> Yeah 3 is where biotics really came into their own
[5:26:47] <ioci2112> infiltrator probably
[5:26:48] <%MidnightBurst12> fun = good
[5:26:49] <%bread_assassin> Sentinal 2 is real good.
[5:26:49] <+Qexec> IInfiltrator
[5:26:50] <James_Quivers> soldier for the special assault rifle that melts everything
[5:26:50] <+lucaflowe> Infiltrator
[5:26:51] <otakon17> Vanguard is GREAT in 2
[5:26:51] <$Futurecity10> Sentinal
[5:26:51] <+SaintValiance> Soldier & Infiltrator
[5:26:51] <peachy996> Infiltrator I suppose
[5:26:52] <%Rumbutt> Soldier is definitely best in 2 no question
[5:26:52] <chancho4tierra> there is no argument is amazing
[5:26:53] <Grandnatics> Biotic classes in 2 get nerfed by higher difficulties thanks to barriers and armor
[5:26:53] <+D00msDayDan> infiltrator with a bullet
[5:26:53] <DatAsuna> Solider the most boring, but strongest class in 2
[5:26:54] <Dabrikishaw> Sentinel is the best class in 2
[5:26:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Infiltrator is busted
[5:26:58] <fritz_dacat> The romance class
[5:26:58] <DatAsuna> INfiltrator is a close second
[5:26:59] <Parapattern> Ask what Elmo thinks
[5:27:00] <aiutare47> infil is great always
[5:27:00] <%mikeriffic> its so much fun in 3 omg in 2 i played soilder
[5:27:00] <$Faustgesicht> soldier
[5:27:00] <Sunstalker> Infiltrator is the most boring shit, it's stealth archer ffs
[5:27:00] <peachy996> It has the Cloak
[5:27:00] <+Punchasaur> Someone would have to love chat first before divorcing chat
[5:27:00] <Grandnatics> They're all fun
[5:27:00] <%JoshManVGH> Vanguard isn't invincible in 2, but the hit and run was a lot of fun.
[5:27:02] <Kidbizzaro> Its basic and boring, but Soldier
[5:27:02] <otakon17> 2 is where the Vanguard truly came into it's own first
[5:27:03] <allanmiri> Seriously Liara is giving Shepard the fuck eyes in that lift...
[5:27:03] <DatAsuna> Then power gap everything else
[5:27:05] <DSD24> You get cool cloaking and the WIDOW
[5:27:05] <otakon17> LIES
[5:27:06] <AmuserName> Assault Rifle Sentinel
[5:27:06] <RetributionP> vanguard
[5:27:08] <%rockcentuar> TECH
[5:27:09] <%ashton_nobal> ashton_nobal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[5:27:10] <+InternetShis> The door-
[5:27:10] <DatAsuna> I like sentinel most but sentinel is not best
[5:27:11] <otakon17> SENTINEL
[5:27:11] <akitanito> oh no rogue vi
[5:27:11] <%DJFakie> Soldier's slomo upgrade is nuts
[5:27:13] <otakon17> TECH ARMOR
[5:27:14] <%GinAndRoses> infiltrator is preeetty good
[5:27:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Biotics are only bad in 2 on higher difficulties
[5:27:17] <+D00msDayDan> endgame infiltrator slows down time whenever you scope in and the cloak gives you a FAT damage boost on your first shot
[5:27:19] <%AzureGale> Tech classes are 4/7.3 in 2
[5:27:20] <fritz_dacat> What class helps you make out with aliens
[5:27:20] <DatAsuna> Bear in mind my definition of best is strongest
[5:27:21] <Kidbizzaro> Welcome, Cat
[5:27:22] <Grandnatics> Sentinel has ABSURD survivability
[5:27:28] <peachy996> Vanguard's Faults in 2 are more on the general movement of ME2
[5:27:31] <otakon17> yeah on vanilla Biotics are great
[5:27:32] <chancho4tierra> is not the most broken class but is the most fun to play and watch
[5:27:32] <+lucaflowe> Tech is pretty busted in ME 2
[5:27:32] <DatAsuna> So my favourite class is not the best
[5:27:41] <%JoshManVGH> Maybe all the classes are good in 2?
[5:27:41] <jorniev> vanguard is my favorite, you mass effect people to death
[5:27:42] <$Faustgesicht> oh Sentinel is just fucking busted in 2
[5:27:46] <Sp3ctre48> I only say that because Biotics won't affect armor, barrier or shields in 2 and it makes those classes kinda dull to play
[5:27:47] <$Futurecity10> Sentinal because of the Locust DLC SMG, then multiclass with Assault rife with the Mattock
[5:27:47] <DatAsuna> Sentinel auto detonating the armour on shield drop was a bad design choice
[5:27:47] <+ClamityArt> In 2 it really focuses on cover. Infiltrator goes hard in it. Charge on higher difficulties got me killed a lot until I got Barrier.
[5:27:47] <otakon17> but EVERYTHING gets protection in ME2 on harder difficulties making Biotics much weaker
[5:27:49] <allanmiri> I really liked the bug monster mission in the orignal ME1.
[5:27:58] <+Chimeraelite> I just went Soldier and borrowed Samara's Reave power for near instant killing of the "control" dude. 2 reaves in 1 party is neat
[5:27:59] <DatAsuna> The way ME3 handles the cooldown on the shield is better for sentinel
[5:28:00] <Parapattern> Oof that light is not flattering to Pat's character
[5:28:01] <%AzureGale> No all the classes suck in 2
[5:28:09] <televisedrevolting> The only thing I really leaned on in 2 was Warp Ammo+Tempest SMG and that killed most things.
[5:28:15] <DatAsuna> as is just being able to do every kind of combo as sentinel
[5:28:20] <+Chimeraelite> Cooldowns in ME3 are hilariously low compared to the others
[5:28:22] <%AzureGale> Warlock is best class in 2
[5:28:27] <destroyeverythingin> finished the trilogy years ago almost done with the remastered ME3
[5:28:30] <otakon17> Warp Ammo was best overall ammo
[5:28:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt people that say biotics are bad in 2 are talking about higher difficulties
[5:28:39] <otakon17> unless you fought regenerating enemies
[5:28:40] <+Chimeraelite> although I'm also Lv20 right off the bat cause import. Still biotic is beautiful
[5:28:40] <peachy996> Also Wheel of Life
[5:28:42] <%JoshManVGH> Divorce ME2 frome legendary. throw the whole man away.
[5:28:48] <DatAsuna> While the biotic powers are less optimal in ME2 than soldier, I do think they're more successful at what they wanted to do.
[5:28:51] <sweatch0> ELMO
[5:28:52] <allanmiri> So Pat who you gonna fuck? Or have Shepard fuck I mean?
[5:29:05] <%trustycoyote> So SMT5 release date was leaked by Atlus
[5:29:07] <akitanito> oh no, can't just spam up
[5:29:09] <+ClamityArt> Can I unite the chat back together if I say Tali is best girl?
[5:29:16] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[5:29:18] <DSD24> Hang out with Samara she's cool
[5:29:19] <otakon17> urge to play ME1 again RISING
[5:29:22] <%DJFakie> @ClamityArt NO
[5:29:22] <allanmiri> Tali is best girl.
[5:29:24] <MichelangeloStark> what is this team comp? did Pat just go Blue Team???
[5:29:26] <+Chimeraelite> Samara best girl >:(
[5:29:26] <%Monkeyweed21> just spend the Omni Gel Shephard
[5:29:29] <+InternetShis> Buggo burn
[5:29:29] <DSD24> @trustycoyote Ooo we got a date for SMT?
[5:29:31] <%AzureGale> No Liara is best girl
[5:29:33] <televisedrevolting> Yay they're dead
[5:29:40] <+liquidzr0> adumBooty
[5:29:45] <allanmiri> Only bad part about playing FemSHep is you can't romance Tali.
[5:29:48] <MichelangeloStark> @allanmiri fact
[5:29:48] <otakon17> hey at least you can try again in Legendary, I remember the vanilla release only let you attempt it ONCE before it was locked forever
[5:29:53] <%trustycoyote> @DSD24 Nov
[5:29:54] <%Ranryu692> LUL that model just blinked out of existence when you shot it
[5:29:55] <+Chimeraelite> Milf asari ftw
[5:30:01] <%AzureGale> FemShep is best girl
[5:30:01] <MichelangeloStark> @allanmiri more facts
[5:30:01] <otakon17> BURN BAYB BURN,  MASS EFFECT INFERNO
[5:30:02] <%trustycoyote> @DSD24 Sorry Nov 11
[5:30:11] <fritz_dacat> Fem shep is best girl let’s be real
[5:30:12] <Melon_Bread_Enthusiast> Melon_Bread_Enthusiast subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:30:13] <DSD24> @trustycoyote Ey that's not too bad actually
[5:30:17] <%AzureGale> Morrigan is best girl
[5:30:18] <%DJFakie> It's that dog?
[5:30:19] <CrimsonGargoyle> BARZ
[5:30:25] <%ingman112> This about to look jank
[5:30:26] <CheekyBirb> @allanmiri at least garrus doesn't support genocide
[5:30:29] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlep psaWhat
[5:30:34] <DSD24> @AzureGale That's the truth
[5:30:34] <+Chimeraelite> mine's got grey hair and green eyes
[5:30:34] <DatAsuna> Vanguard will be most popoular
[5:30:34] <+InternetShis> One argue
[5:30:37] <%luckysteak> engineer has the biggest improvement
[5:30:39] <DatAsuna> just cause the dash is flashy
[5:30:40] <aiutare47> probably Infiltrator for sheer DPS
[5:30:43] <DSD24> Morrigan is top tier
[5:30:45] <mr_sups> Vanguard
[5:30:46] <DatAsuna> It just also has the most problems
[5:30:48] <Dunmarkh> the one with the space magic good
[5:30:49] <%luckysteak> but soldier with the mattock rifle is simple and OP
[5:30:50] <peachy996> Different opinions I suppose
[5:30:54] <chancho4tierra> is not the most broken class but is the most fun to play and watch
[5:30:55] <%DJFakie> You just want engagement, Pat! psaWhat
[5:30:56] <%Rumbutt> ME2 Soldier gets time slow, combine that with sniper for ez game
[5:30:56] <karl_rex> Sentinel
[5:30:58] <+kiradusk4200> this is madness, Vanguard is great in me2
[5:30:59] <AmuserName> Sentinel is EXCELLENT with stripping all defenses.
[5:31:02] <+Toaderator> Soldier gets 5 guns
[5:31:04] <DatAsuna> Soldier is the most boring but most strong
[5:31:06] <CrimsonGargoyle> the best class is always the one you have most fun playing
[5:31:07] <MichelangeloStark> @fritz_dacat can't deny that
[5:31:09] <Parapattern> Has any major race in the ME universe NOT comitted genocide?
[5:31:10] <+InternetShis> Engineer in 3 because it has an exclusive Paragon interupt
[5:31:13] <otakon17> they're ALL great
[5:31:14] <DSD24> Man I miss Dead Space
[5:31:14] <+Chimeraelite> Time slow in ME2 is beautiful
[5:31:16] <%Monkeyweed21> Infiltrator gets stupid damage bonuses and invisibility to bail them out
[5:31:17] <$renegade_blade> sentinel can be ridiculously tanky in me3 if you stack tech armor with the defense matrix ability you can get
[5:31:18] <allanmiri> @CheekyBirb Garrus do be a good boi.
[5:31:19] <DatAsuna> @Rumbutt time slow that also adds a damage and defense multiplier
[5:31:22] <infiniteFERN> yeah honestly
[5:31:25] <%DJFakie> I didn't like adept until Biotic Combos
[5:31:28] <otakon17> Sentinel is tanky and great at stripping protection, Biotics on vanilla OWN
[5:31:28] <%maenos2> vanguard has shktgun
[5:31:31] <DatAsuna> Soldier in 2 is stupidly overpowered yet boring
[5:31:31] <$Futurecity10> adept is trash in every game
[5:31:36] <+InternetShis> @parapattern Geth
[5:31:36] <MichelangeloStark> engineer? dispenser goin up
[5:31:38] <%bread_assassin> Adepts got shafted in ME2 since they only work on red health
[5:31:39] <Mattais88> Me2 adept is terrible because all you get are pistols and smg
[5:31:39] <+ClamityArt> Time slow and Reave are busted in ME2
[5:31:41] <%AzureGale> But tech armor is for exploding
[5:31:44] <+SimplesRock> Oh same. It was not great
[5:31:45] <peachy996> I hated Engineer
[5:31:47] <%Rumbutt> @DatAsuna Damn I forgot about that part, op
[5:31:52] <+kiradusk4200> listen sometimes a bullet solves the problem better than a mass effect field
[5:31:54] <%ingman112> ME2 suffers from the new shared cooldown, they hadn’t quite worked it out
[5:31:58] <DatAsuna> N7 Adept in ME3 MP are amazing tho
[5:32:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Adept doesnt shine until Biotic combos are a big deal
[5:32:00] <%DJFakie> "No autopsy, no foul"
[5:32:02] <otakon17> >hating the combat drone
[5:32:03] <AoG_JarlRaven> Oh i remember this
[5:32:10] <%RetroCop87> I hope you get the chance to rub it in the security lady's face how shit she is at managing her station
[5:32:10] <otakon17> yeah shared cooldown sucked
[5:32:14] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt In Mass Effect 2, you have to use weapons that are good at taking out armor when you use biotics. That's why these nOoBs believes biotics suck in Mass Effect 2. Vanguard is awesome in 2
[5:32:18] <allanmiri> "I'm not assuming anything." That's fair.
[5:32:25] <%AzureGale> Why didn't ME just use an MP bar
[5:32:32] <jimmytwofeet> De bastardes
[5:32:39] <DatAsuna> yeah global cooldown sucks
[5:32:54] <DatAsuna> @AzureGale because if you make the biotics finite people would use them even less
[5:33:21] <%sabertoothzombie> this SMT V leak makes me so happy
[5:33:22] <allanmiri> "I'll keep my fellow NPCs alive you go save the day super hero main character man."
[5:33:23] <DSD24> Wow that's a line
[5:33:28] <+ClamityArt> I love how a hot blue lady can just roll up and go "Hello yes I am a mama asari let me in."
[5:33:29] <%peanutdot007> He is so right, every lab in Mass Effect gets people killed
[5:33:35] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt that's why biotics in 2 usually specialize in weapons that take out armor and heavy weapon that takes out shields
[5:33:36] <Lamokmok> I think the worst part for Vanguard in 2 is all those guys in sniping positions you can't reach.
[5:33:42] <%AzureGale> @DatAsuna I was thinking of regenerating MP but fair
[5:33:52] <AoG_JarlRaven> Honestly thought SMTV was going to slip into 2022
[5:33:53] <jimmytwofeet> zzz alyens
[5:34:08] <DatAsuna> @AzureGale well then it isn't an MP system so much as just a different way of showing cooldowns
[5:34:16] <vVAstrAVv> did his voice change?
[5:34:20] <%trustycoyote> Yeah thought it would be bumped into 2022 as well
[5:34:21] <+shapeforn> I'm just gonna say it, abilities, if nothing else, were pretty fun in Andromeda
[5:34:21] <DSD24> At least SMT5 is getting a worldwide release
[5:34:45] <vVAstrAVv> WHYS HE GOT 2 VOICES
[5:34:45] <FeralFozzie> we call them the hot labs because the "bow-chica-bow-wow" labs is too long
[5:34:46] <%sabertoothzombie> I can't believe how much info got released so early
[5:34:48] <allanmiri> They're coming outta the goddamn wallS!!!
[5:34:54] <fritz_dacat> Which one
[5:34:59] <peachy996> You are so huge it doesnt matter if your gun overheats
[5:35:01] <DatAsuna> Andromeda had a lot of fun powers
[5:35:12] <DatAsuna> It's a shame it didn't have all the ME3 MP powers tho
[5:35:15] <allanmiri> @vVAstrAVv Actor couldn't show up that day and they need the line NOW I guess?
[5:35:22] <HeroToxiko> the dash was fun in andromeda
[5:35:23] <DatAsuna> Though it kept a few like lash .etc
[5:35:25] <warpath1911> Wow already to noveria? Isn't this stream 2? Lol
[5:35:25] <Basch71> I liked the shooting in Andromeda and the dashes were pretty sick
[5:35:29] <Detrius25> psaGoblin Hello our wounderful Ginger Shep
[5:35:29] <%trustycoyote> @sabertoothzombie Yeah it's a crazy amount that was leaked so blinders up until Nov
[5:35:29] <%AzureGale> Andromeda let you build however the fuck you wanted. That was cool
[5:35:33] <AoG_JarlRaven> Well animals can’t learn if they’re dead
[5:35:40] <peachy996> Andromeda Biotic is a fun prospect
[5:35:49] <peachy996> Haven't done it yet
[5:35:53] <DatAsuna> andromeda added a ton of mobility to the combat, the soft cover system worked well with the dashes/jumps
[5:35:53] <+shapeforn> I think Bioware has gotten better at combat, if nothing else
[5:35:53] <DSD24> I just switching power types didn't start another cooldown
[5:36:01] <vVAstrAVv> @allanmiri then do them all with the second guy lol
[5:36:06] <+InternetShis> @datasuna ME3 mods are fun for that reason, as well as making choices have actual consequences with war asset rebalancing
[5:36:07] <%RetroCop87> I'm here with the science team! *CHEERS*
[5:36:11] <DatAsuna> Being able to singularity into vanguard charge in mid-air was cool tho
[5:36:17] <DSD24> Asari version of Fantastic from NV
[5:36:18] <jbrowning134> keekee
[5:36:24] <peachy996> First time playing it was basically Infiltrator plus Incinerate and something else
[5:36:27] <mr_sups> Elmo!
[5:36:33] <Profmcstevie> Personal Question: Why are you a cunt
[5:36:33] <warpath1911> Fuck I remember that bitch
[5:36:35] <HeroToxiko> ye
[5:36:35] <Doomstar16> Spout the random facts lady.
[5:36:39] <BeezusHrist> Indoctrinated
[5:36:40] <DatAsuna> "tell me about your species"
[5:36:52] <peachy996> Rude Lady is Rude
[5:36:55] <%Reveresao> oof
[5:36:55] <CrimsonGargoyle> "i WaS mEdItaTinG aNd HaVinG mY lAtTe"
[5:36:58] <+D00msDayDan> fuck you lady we do meditation too
[5:37:01] <Doomstar16> "All asari know each other."
[5:37:01] <DatAsuna> based
[5:37:08] <otakon17> SHE SASSY
[5:37:09] <DatAsuna> she is my spirit animal
[5:37:12] <warpath1911> WutFace
[5:37:21] <%Reveresao> That lady is right tho
[5:37:21] <KingSpunf> Big Lads
[5:37:23] <HeroToxiko> your brain literally projects what other people want to see what do you think you look like LUL
[5:37:30] <otakon17> the SASS on this one
[5:37:35] <+shapeforn> Inquisition combat got pretty decent too... idk maybe DA4 will play well at least
[5:37:36] <allanmiri> I LOVE these guys.
[5:37:41] <%ingman112> I’m actually quite impressed with chat for not calling her a Karen
[5:37:45] <jackelzxaa> How sad would you be if an elcor died in a mass effect game
[5:37:45] <otakon17> I love the Elcor
[5:37:53] <+cafefunk> Why do all aliens speak English, do they wear translators?
[5:37:54] <otakon17> I wish we could have played them in ME3 Multiplayer
[5:37:55] <allanmiri> They're literally my favorite of the aliens.
[5:37:56] <MichelangeloStark> appreciative, gotta love these space elephants
[5:37:59] <Serge_12> Pat, is the Hulk Hogan spirit in you brother? LUL
[5:38:05] <otakon17> they're translated real time
[5:38:06] <DSD24> @cafefunk Yes they do
[5:38:07] <jackelzxaa> Yeah translators are canon
[5:38:09] <peachy996> Yes they have translators
[5:38:10] <KeiPrime> mass effect fields make all the aliens understand each other
[5:38:11] <otakon17> it's explained in the codex
[5:38:12] <Grandnatics> @cafefunk Yes, in ear pieces
[5:38:14] <KeiPrime> probably
[5:38:15] <%AzureGale> @cafefunk Yes
[5:38:15] <jackelzxaa> It comes up in thanes romance
[5:38:24] <otakon17> THAT'S A GOOD LICENSE
[5:38:31] <jackelzxaa> It cant translate the drell word “siha”
[5:38:32] <DatAsuna> I hated inqusition combta because it forced you to plant your feet to channel for melee strikes. DAI in so many ways was just a worse version of swtor @shapeforn
[5:38:38] <otakon17> you want your radar to work? Don't sell the Optics
[5:38:42] <Parapattern> Thank goodness they ditched it
[5:38:47] <peachy996> I'm shocked there's no Sell All button
[5:38:51] <BeezusHrist> omnigel...
[5:38:54] <DSD24> DAI had that cool Knight Enchanter class though
[5:39:02] <jackelzxaa> Make omni goo, pat
[5:39:04] <otakon17> just keep at least 3 of each mod
[5:39:07] <Profmcstevie> Games with tons of loot and no proper system to deal with it are a crime
[5:39:09] <aiutare47> Hey Pat did you ever Andromeda? And if not, do you have any intention of trying it? After youre done with 3, whenever that is...
[5:39:11] <jackelzxaa> Turn your garbage into goo
[5:39:20] <otakon17> since you use only 1 weapon really at a time per squaddie and yourself
[5:39:23] <Grandnatics> nooo rail extensions
[5:39:25] <DatAsuna> He played the start of andromeda.
[5:39:28] <warpath1911> Gimme day goo!
[5:39:31] <otakon17> SAVE THE POLONIUM ROUNDS
[5:39:32] <+ClamityArt> There's basically no reason to do that
[5:39:34] <otakon17> NO
[5:39:35] <otakon17> YOU DO
[5:39:37] <DatAsuna> Andromeda really frontloads all the worst stuff too. lol
[5:39:39] <MichelangeloStark> why aren't we making strides in Omni gel?
[5:39:41] <peachy996> Andromeda is much like 1 in the amount of inventory cleanup you can do
[5:39:42] <+InternetShis> And Tali, who is yours
[5:39:50] <fritz_dacat> And joker
[5:39:50] <+shapeforn> @datasuna I see what ya mean, but in the late game you could actually get some fun builds going, similar to Andromeda. like a freezing dagger throwing rogue.
[5:39:53] <akitanito> are you planning to kill everyone in 2
[5:39:55] <jackelzxaa> Theres some wacky stuff you can do with mods in the lategame
[5:40:02] <AoG_JarlRaven> I wish there was an elcor squadmate
[5:40:06] <DatAsuna> Andromeda changed their inventory UI to be more like how fallout/elder scrolls do stores .etc
[5:40:15] <DatAsuna> Which I don't love either but it's a bit better than this
[5:40:17] <jackelzxaa> Cryo rounds turn assault rifle into almost a semi auto
[5:40:19] <jbrowning134> God the items in this game are way too repetitive
[5:40:22] <dragon_ab> Hello everyone
[5:40:23] <%DJFakie> Are you already at the cash cap?
[5:40:23] <James_Quivers> How would  that even work
[5:40:28] <DSD24> Weren't Elcor like walking tanks?
[5:40:33] <+InternetShis> @patstaresat Any plans for murder during the suicide mission?
[5:40:36] <$Solid_Stro> @akitanito Typically everyone survives but Jack for me sabert14Box
[5:40:38] <Profmcstevie> Elcor squadmate would add at least 4 hours to game time given how slow they talk
[5:40:38] <DSD24> Like they had cannons on their backs?
[5:40:52] <DatAsuna> yeah if you minmax mods you get a full auto shotgun that never overheats
[5:40:52] <jackelzxaa> The problem with an elcor squadmate is if he gets shot you’d cry every time
[5:40:58] <otakon17> yeah, Elcor in combat are basically LIVING TANKS
[5:41:05] <warpath1911> Walking tanks was a term they begrudgingly accepted I think
[5:41:05] <MichelangeloStark> @james_quivers how would that work? awesome, that's what
[5:41:06] <AoG_JarlRaven> @profmcstevie it’s ok cause they’ll just teleport to catch up to you 4Head
[5:41:07] <otakon17> they're super heavily armored, shielded and pack MASSIVE guns
[5:41:25] <otakon17> sure they're slow but when you have FIREPOWAH and DAKKA
[5:41:33] <$Faustgesicht> Could you play an Elcor in Multiplayer?
[5:41:35] <+ClamityArt> But you could be more OP Pat please the children are crying they need .03% more damage
[5:41:41] <otakon17> yeah until you fight more than one Krogan at a time and it just out-regens your damage output
[5:41:47] <jackelzxaa> On normal pat doesnt have to worry as much about enemy biotics and tech attacks so he can face fuck the game pretty easy
[5:41:47] <peachy996> No Elcor were not in MP
[5:41:49] <allanmiri> So Pat who you gonna have Shepard fuck if anyone?
[5:41:51] <ioci2112> @shapeforn I actually enjoyed playing inquisition in nightmare as an archer with all the movement habilities you have, you could basically go from a shotgunner to a sniper in 2 seconds while stunning, poisoning and nuking the shit out of every enemy at the same time
[5:41:53] <peachy996> Volus were though
[5:41:53] <otakon17> I wonder what Volus look like under their suits
[5:41:55] <Parapattern> Shut up! Stupid idiot!
[5:41:59] <fritz_dacat> The came from Haloo with 2 O’s
[5:42:02] <jackelzxaa> Veteran is when they start fighting back for real
[5:42:05] <$Clarke1010> Is Pat basically a Volus?
[5:42:13] <%DJFakie> Han only gets a few lines but is pretty cool
[5:42:15] <DSD24> That was such a bad idea
[5:42:22] <+black_pariah> i wonder what does wrex say about this
[5:42:25] <otakon17> Han Olar
[5:42:30] <allanmiri> Oooh. I remember this convo now.
[5:42:32] <+senfood> I like this guy.
[5:42:33] <otakon17> he's an odd VOlus
[5:42:33] <Fear_Ranjer> PUPPY
[5:42:36] <+ClamityArt> Big baby...
[5:42:38] <jbrowning134> Do the dog and the cat play together?
[5:42:38] <otakon17> he talks like he's a human
[5:42:40] <%AzureGale> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[5:42:41] <warpath1911> Based
[5:42:41] <MichelangeloStark> "I'm sane! God, am I sane." that's a good quote right there
[5:42:46] <fritz_dacat> Aww yeah burgers get pat
[5:42:46] <otakon17> GIEF!
[5:42:49] <$Faustgesicht> I feel bad for this guy
[5:43:03] <otakon17> same
[5:43:15] <otakon17> he's definitely got PTSD
[5:43:26] <AoG_JarlRaven> Man it’s crazy how vividly i remember this dialogue when I see the gameplay again
[5:43:27] <warpath1911> That's survivors guilt if I've ever seen it
[5:43:30] <allanmiri> He got some serious survivor's guilt. Also we weren't there so it's not clear if the woman could've made it in time or not without both them dying.
[5:43:33] <%ingman112> Is this Konrad from Spec Ops? Kinda sounds like him
[5:43:36] <tanarath> Fatal dose of capitalism
[5:43:37] <akitanito> why.
[5:43:40] <Parapattern> Give this dipshit a weggie
[5:43:41] <Jaysky> I'm positive I've heard this one
[5:43:41] <peachy996> Oh hey it's Scientist Pat
[5:43:43] <%AzureGale> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[5:43:43] <jackelzxaa> Imagine if female volus were really tall and had lupus

[5:46:07] <Grandnatics> *** problems
[5:46:09] <peachy996> I'd question the logic in that but he is Salarian
[5:46:18] <malcobraaklynny> the NDA's won't matter when you're DEAD
[5:46:25] <ammobasket> NDA's don't work for crimes, any crimes to report?

[5:48:26] <warpath1911> @srthunda The P in PTSD stands for puns
[5:48:45] <jackelzxaa> The med labs are in the side basement by the elcor
[5:48:49] <jackelzxaa> Next to the asari
[5:48:50] <MichelangeloStark> @srthunda its the few things they can enjoy in a job where everything is clinical and logical
[5:49:22] <akitanito> ppfffttt
[5:49:25] <jackelzxaa> They darkened his hair too
[5:49:28] <peachy996> This guy sounds like a male version of Dr. Chakwas
[5:49:33] <warpath1911> This doc also voices the dwarf merchant in dragon age origins
[5:49:37] <peachy996> Like the accent is similar
[5:49:37] <%AzureGale> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm

[5:50:22] <Fear_Ranjer> God Garrus is so attractive in this
[5:50:38] <peachy996> He is very pretty
[5:50:39] <MichelangeloStark> I loathe how sentences just get a new line for 1-3 words.
[5:50:39] <warpath1911> A weapon to surpass metal gear
[5:50:39] <%POUND_CAKE94> Was just thinking “no way Pat is still going” and now I’m BACK IN
[5:50:40] <+ClamityArt> Those are the worst kinds of arguments. "If I dont do it someone else will!"
[5:50:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Fear_Ranjer he a cutie
[5:50:42] <jackelzxaa> Yeah, corona virus is illegal
[5:50:54] <AoG_JarlRaven> Garrus has a nice voice
[5:50:58] <allanmiri> @Fear_Ranjer They knew what they were doing.Garrus Liara and Tali are like the top three in these games.
[5:51:15] <%POUND_CAKE94> Isn’t Garrus in LA Noire?
[5:51:25] <+trackles_64> bio terror
[5:51:26] <peachy996> He is
[5:51:28] <warpath1911> @pound_cake94 Yes
[5:51:33] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt that guy was voiced by Lt Barclay
[5:51:38] <peachy996> He was going to be your Burglary partner
[5:51:39] <%DianaTheAscian> he is?
[5:51:43] <%POUND_CAKE94> The voice of cop
[5:51:48] <+holyxgrale> The worst
[5:51:49] <akitanito> from your dinner?

[5:51:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt need to talk to the capitan
[5:52:02] <Fear_Ranjer> god I thought you meant Garrus himself and not his actor and now I'm imagining Garrus in a noir detective film
[5:52:04] <+holyxgrale> GET IT OUT
[5:52:20] <akitanito> get gief to eat it
[5:52:34] <%POUND_CAKE94> Garrus and Cole may be a okay team. Garrus and Phelps would save the world
[5:52:36] <Profmcstevie> Good old RPG flag hitting
[5:52:42] <peachy996> I told you, Save, Decrypt the Door and Enjoy the chaos
[5:52:43] <MichelangeloStark> @clamityart so might as well get in front of the situation to better control this genie coming out of the bottle? frustrating..
[5:52:46] <mr_sups> 4 hours of sleep in 3 days? What is he? A grad student
[5:52:57] <peachy996> Everyone gets suuuuuper pissed
[5:53:02] <%POUND_CAKE94> No wait Garrus and KELSO would save the world
[5:53:19] <MichelangeloStark> @fear_ranjer give him an old detectives hat, a cigarette, and trench coat
[5:53:26] <Fear_Ranjer> This backtracking looked so much more passable as a teen with empty brain syndrome
[5:53:27] <+senfood> Liara just standing there knowing she looks hot as fuck.

[5:56:40] <peachy996> Weapons free more like they're free
[5:56:41] <%MidnightBurst12> that was sad
[5:56:44] <AoG_JarlRaven> The Asari was in cahoots with the asari?!!!? Unfathomable
[5:56:45] <%bugz_munny> you better parse pink on mass effect 1 normal mode
[5:56:45] <CheekyBirb> have to go deeper

[5:57:43] <warpath1911> Lol can't say geth here
[5:57:44] <akitanito> I like how everyone else in this room doesn't even care about the dead guard
[5:57:45] <allanmiri> Just like a volus
[5:57:45] <%Ranryu692> ye
[5:57:53] <+ClamityArt> I love doing that to my old english but I think he hates it
[5:57:54] <Doomstar16> Lol good one.

[5:58:05] <heartlesshealer> tears of joy
[5:58:06] <arkv01> a lil bit of matricide to seal the deal
[5:58:06] <malcobraaklynny> What do volus breath?
[5:58:08] <allanmiri> Liara is gonna ink when she sees you kill her mom.
[5:58:09] <Parapattern> Stupid manthing! I'm fucking ballin'
[5:58:10] <%ingman112> Nice save
[5:58:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> YEAH, GET HER PORKED UP ON TEARS SO THAT UNCLE PAT CAN TAKE CARE OF HER.
[5:58:14] <peachy996> Either with eye tears or crotch tears
[5:58:19] <MichelangeloStark> I mean the Asari are based on women with slicked back hair after coming out of a pool
[5:58:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Call her a packet of Fruit Gushers
[5:58:22] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[5:58:22] <AoG_JarlRaven> Lmao i completely forgot that there’s just a dead guy and everyone else carries on
[5:58:33] <%StaceMcGate> "Shepard, what is WAP? Is that a human condition?"
[5:58:34] <allanmiri> They're squids right? So they should likely ink.
[5:58:43] <%ingman112> Like fish covered in sandpaper
[5:58:45] <warpath1911> It's a dry wet
[5:58:46] <AdamLon4> Asari are notoriously dry? Nvm pat romance a humanoid
[5:58:46] <peachy996> I swore he was gonna say Alexia
[5:58:55] <%Taisuru> Saren T. Specter
[5:58:59] <MichelangeloStark> @allanmiri they ain't squids nor are they kids
[5:59:04] <+DukeBlack_> is that doofenshmirtz?!
[5:59:22] <%luckysteak> lol
[5:59:30] <+senfood> [X] DOUBT
[5:59:39] <akitanito> what about the maintenance area
[5:59:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Liari might as well be a Blue Raspberry Gusher at this point
[5:59:41] <MichelangeloStark> why aren't we making strides in medí gel?
[5:59:48] <Fear_Ranjer> Paragon til' death
[5:59:50] <awalbaru> hey guys, this is Mass Effect 2 already?
[5:59:53] <allanmiri> @MichelangeloStark LOL.
[5:59:57] <plaguedoctor_syan> Thanks for the entreteriment Pat
[5:59:58] <akitanito> no
[6:00:08] <intestinal_bleeding> Good boys
[6:00:09] <%rockcentuar> Hot labs
[6:00:09] <warpath1911> @michelangelostark Too hard, use a band-aid
[6:00:12] <awalbaru> thx
[6:00:12] <Jaysky> @awalbaru This is 1
[6:00:18] <MichelangeloStark> @fear_ranjer you ruined it. you took it and you ruined it.
[6:00:34] <viewtifulr> shit gonna have to catch the vod from back to when they extorted that guy to admit for evidence
[6:00:57] <MichelangeloStark> @warpath1911 use bandages. bandaids are copyrighted name of a product, not a type of product
[6:01:02] <%logoth_> Dig up
[6:01:04] <%Monkeyweed21> the doctor @PatStaresAt
[6:01:10] <MichelangeloStark> can't let the lawyers get ya!
[6:01:11] <peachy996> wing it
[6:01:25] <sweatch0> dog protocol door
[6:01:26] <%afronooch> got ask him for the pass
[6:01:27] <RetributionP> pat really having to work his brain tonight
[6:01:27] <akitanito> you forgot to ask for access
[6:01:27] <Jaysky> Not enough
[6:01:31] <sweatch0> no no
[6:01:34] <tanarath> SPEAK AGAIN
[6:01:39] <heartlesshealer> another slang for the bandaid type of bandages is "adhesive" if that works for whoever was asking
[6:01:46] <tanarath> You could have asked
[6:01:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Volus told you to ask the doctor
[6:02:00] <%ingman112> There’s multiple ways to do this, you can also just go to the hot labs
[6:02:01] <jackelzxaa> I think youre suppised to go to the hot labs now where the captain is
[6:02:01] <+ClamityArt> You gotta go through storage I think
[6:02:02] <MichelangeloStark> @heartlesshealer oo nice
[6:02:07] <jackelzxaa> Theres an elevator infront of him
[6:02:09] <+balroy> what class did you pick
[6:02:23] <Dunmarkh> @balroy vanguard
[6:02:24] <jackelzxaa> This part is so confusing to get through
[6:02:29] <akitanito> nah this is on you
[6:02:29] <AoG_JarlRaven> Lol that running animation looks a little goofy when zoomed out
[6:02:31] <allanmiri> Vanguard. I think.
[6:02:37] <peachy996> Peak 15 is slow
[6:02:42] <%POUND_CAKE94> I fkn love shotguns in this game
[6:02:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat there's only backtracking because you forgot to ask and got lost LUL
[6:02:47] <jackelzxaa> The hot labs are the elevator infront of the captain
[6:02:49] <RetributionP> back tracking because you missed diolog dosnt count
[6:02:56] <peachy996> Port Hanshan is the real good part of Noveria imo
[6:02:57] <+balroy> is vanguard the charge shotgun class?
[6:02:58] <Profmcstevie> For an area called Peak 15 this content per minute is PLUMMETING
[6:02:58] <DSD24> Ferros was cool
[6:02:58] <RubberFistFight> so many corridors
[6:03:00] <%afronooch> Noveria is a slog
[6:03:01] <jackelzxaa> Thats a thing you can do in a weird order but its mandatory
[6:03:06] <%maenos2> yeah noveria sucks
[6:03:07] <tanarath> Feros waz better
[6:03:09] <dOjOTron> remember mass effect 1 was just digital comic? smart
[6:03:12] <Dunmarkh> @balroy ye
[6:03:16] <%Monkeyweed21> you're only backtracking cuz you keep going the wrong way
[6:03:22] <tanarath> such a weird & interesting premise
[6:03:23] <MichelangeloStark> forgot to ask : how are the elevator loading times on console????
[6:03:40] <heartlesshealer> breathable air yay
[6:03:44] <peachy996> Renegade players can just say fuckit and hack the doors open
[6:03:52] <warpath1911> @michelangelostark Pretty fast. Plus there's a skip button
[6:03:59] <%DJFakie> You can do down and raid the front entrance for more XP with no drawbacks
[6:04:12] <%AzureGale> It is time!
[6:04:19] <Minorou> the backdown
[6:04:20] <notsoy> ALEXA, PLAY PLEDGE OF DEMON
[6:04:20] <heartlesshealer> game's catching wise, Pat. It's making you press left and right now to hack
[6:04:20] <allanmiri> Nope.
[6:04:21] <%DJFakie> It's in the elevator here
[6:04:22] <akitanito> not like they'd be a threat to you
[6:04:24] <MichelangeloStark> @warpath1911 whoa... nice!!
[6:04:26] <ChungusQuest> That must have looked great from her perspective
[6:04:27] <%POUND_CAKE94> I remember hating all the loading in ME2 on 360
[6:04:27] <+trackles_64> NOT THAT WAY
[6:04:28] <%wibbwobbler> doodWat
[6:04:35] <sweatch0> peepee

[6:05:11] <+balroy> do everything else b4 boss
[6:05:14] <AoG_JarlRaven> For some reason the layout of the room is this boss fight is very memorable
[6:05:18] <%DJFakie> You fight the guards but there's no drawback
[6:05:25] <peachy996> That's why lol
[6:05:34] <$Faustgesicht> Oh
[6:05:37] <$Faustgesicht> oop
[6:05:40] <RedPlasticCup> the guards HATE IT
[6:05:43] <%DJFakie> I mean, eh
[6:05:46] <warpath1911> Whoops
[6:05:52] <tanarath> IT'S A GOOD SHOOT PART

[6:06:06] <DSD24> There she is
[6:06:06] <tanarath> IT WAS SELF DEFENSE
[6:06:07] <+D00msDayDan> i was not ready for you saying that
[6:06:09] <%maenos2> ACTING
[6:06:11] <viewtifulr> Get a blue slurpie from her mom
[6:06:12] <+trackles_64> You ignored your own daughter
[6:06:13] <+ClamityArt> You're a Vanguard with an N& shotgun, you are beyond death
[6:06:16] <+red_cuppa> no it's normal and just a fairly easy game
[6:06:16] <%DJFakie> Hi Councilor
[6:06:17] <%Monkeyweed21> bitch what

[6:06:25] <+holyxgrale> She knows the ancient techniques to destroy your mind and your monkaS
[6:06:25] <+vaderxyz1970> The Womb is a weapon
[6:06:25] <DSD24> Whatever.
[6:06:26] <RubberFistFight> BLUE
[6:06:26] <+D00msDayDan> jesus benezia
[6:06:27] <RubberFistFight> MILKERS
[6:06:28] <ioci2112> big blue milkers
[6:06:29] <%DianaTheAscian> what?
[6:06:31] <%StaceMcGate> imma be honest, her voice acting work is pretty dry in this
[6:06:33] <warpath1911> @yojohny He's got end game armor and weapons
[6:06:34] <DatAsuna> okay darth zhorrid
[6:06:40] <MichelangeloStark> despair? what is this: danganronpa??
[6:06:45] <malcobraaklynny> She gives Lady D a run for her money
[6:06:49] <Dunmarkh> yes
[6:06:51] <%logoth_> we killed a bunch of them on the way here
[6:06:54] <peachy996> Yesss I enjoy Liara's suffering
[6:06:54] <+trackles_64> @StaceMcGate  its because shes indoctrinated
[6:07:02] <%embranz> this part is so jank lol
[6:07:03] <%MidnightBurst12> yes actually
[6:07:05] <DSD24> Stop
[6:07:07] <RubberFistFight> Z W O R P
[6:07:09] <DSD24> Hammertime!
[6:07:13] <tanarath> SHE DOESN'T
[6:07:14] <James_Quivers> I fogrgot what her deal even was
[6:07:20] <RedPlasticCup> nope
[6:07:22] <%luftraumm1> this fight is awful
[6:07:22] <Jaysky> Dangerous
[6:07:23] <infiniteFERN> STOPZA
[6:07:24] <%POUND_CAKE94> Hahahaha if they don’t yell “I will destroy you” you gotta reload
[6:07:26] <akitanito> how threatening
[6:07:29] <Burger_Bonanza> I saw someone say that Benezia feels like a first-draft character that got left in because nobody had a better idea, and I think that's pretty apt
[6:07:30] <+D00msDayDan> oh man i forgot they tried to have, like, mechanics with this fight
[6:07:30] <malcobraaklynny> This is such an awkward cutscene
[6:07:31] <Ranger747> nice one
[6:07:36] <%logoth_> she used her powers to open a door
[6:07:38] <viewtifulr> melts them
[6:07:39] <warpath1911> She is mentioned alot but not shown much
[6:07:40] <allanmiri> So is this on easy or is that Shotgun just really powerful?
[6:07:40] <%Ranryu692> more like Sorry Commandos
[6:07:40] <%GarbageNirvana> duduDUDUDU
[6:07:40] <akitanito> how is sending geths more dangerous?
[6:07:41] <peachy996> She gets about as much as Liara's Dad if not less
[6:07:44] <+trackles_64> asari comandoes suck
[6:07:46] <%MidnightBurst12> this is so janky
[6:07:52] <%AzureGale> Is Benezia's power level over 9000
[6:07:53] <RedPlasticCup> wow
[6:07:53] <DatAsuna> you don't like add bosses?
[6:07:54] <Basch71> whats Stasis to a Shotgun LUL
[6:07:55] <KeiPrime> whats the scouter say about her power level
[6:07:57] <James_Quivers> WHAT DOES THE UI METER SAY ABOUT BENEZIAS POWER LEVEL?!
[6:07:57] <+D00msDayDan> wait a goddamn minute, have humanoid enemies been completely silent during every fight? where's the GO GO GO and I WILL DESTROY YOU
[6:08:04] <AoG_JarlRaven> Wow...
[6:08:05] <+holyxgrale> She has the power to spawn geth and asari?
[6:08:07] <CheekyBirb> tibby
[6:08:08] <jackelzxaa> Pat on Liquid Normal: “Wow this games easy”
[6:08:08] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[6:08:09] <%logoth_> all she does is summon adds
[6:08:10] <+trackles_64> lol here death animation is so jank
[6:08:14] <Jaysky> 2 in 1
[6:08:16] <akitanito> what is her powers even, opening doors?
[6:08:16] <crookedfinger68> boob window
[6:08:16] <KeiPrime> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[6:08:17] <%POUND_CAKE94> I have yet to hear a good yell
[6:08:17] <DatAsuna> she opened 3 doors, very tiring
[6:08:23] <%radregice> wow
[6:08:23] <+Gespens> alien booba
[6:08:25] <peachy996> What are you doing that's tiring you out lady?
[6:08:25] <illicitdonut> I forgot that this was just a mob battle.
[6:08:26] <MichelangeloStark> psychic powers and all she does is open doors.
[6:08:30] <Jaysky> THIS HURTS YOU.
[6:08:32] <jackelzxaa> Shoot her weakpoint
[6:08:33] <%POUND_CAKE94> The post-fight dialogue from teammates is still there
[6:08:33] <AoG_JarlRaven> Look she’s tiring!
[6:08:33] <Burger_Bonanza> @D00msDayDan the legendary edition nerfed the shouting, it's unfortunate
[6:08:34] <wasdsf> this hurts you
[6:08:35] <warpath1911> Never seen successful asari commandos
[6:08:36] <jackelzxaa> The booba
[6:08:38] <DSD24> Man she is getting bodied
[6:08:38] <ChungusQuest> She summons adds and becomes weakened
[6:08:39] <%maenos2> I know you feel this
[6:08:40] <TomFrancis_> my ice cream BibleThump
[6:08:41] <RetributionP> she is getting weak from opening doors LUL LUL LUL
[6:08:41] <peachy996> These Asari Commandos look like Geth
[6:08:43] <+holyxgrale> She has the ability to completely freeze you on the spot but she decides to spawn people in and make a bubble wtf
[6:08:48] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm a little disappointed they took out the "ENEMIES EVERYWHERE"
[6:08:48] <%DianaTheAscian> now for the booba
[6:08:51] <AoG_JarlRaven> Few humans have.
[6:08:55] <auraofdawn> this part did fuck me up on my first run tho
[6:08:58] <jackelzxaa> This fights harder on veteran because they actually use biotics
[6:09:01] <Zulrez> 'asari commandoes', more like 'we're sorry and hoes'
[6:09:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> Can I point out how they used the Asari scales to give her a villain beard
[6:09:07] <%maenos2> ACT-ING
[6:09:18] <dashmatt> This sounds like an episode of TNG
[6:09:18] <%BigCoffee> Pat's playing on normal, it's easy mode
[6:09:24] <+pre10cious_1> Lady B> Lady D
[6:09:37] <jbrowning134> blue boobies
[6:09:40] <+GuilKato> i feel you could un-indoctrinate her by using asari bonding to fix her brain
[6:09:40] <TheAngryArtist> is that diana troi???
[6:09:41] <RubberFistFight> @goose_attack_almanac Wait, the talking boobs have a face? Interesting...
[6:09:53] <Samurai_Tchan> "ENOUGH TALK ,DIE CONRED"
[6:09:55] <RubberFistFight> @TheAngryArtist Yes it is.
[6:10:01] <yojohny> Normal is a joke, this fight was hell on highest difficulty
[6:10:15] <TheAngryArtist> thats radical
[6:10:23] <Doomstar16> He's pretty arrogant.
[6:10:24] <Profmcstevie> Just a little indoctrination
[6:10:26] <RubberFistFight> IT FELL BEHIND THE COUCH ALRIGHT, IT WASN'T OUR FAULT
[6:10:30] <DatAsuna> Boy it sure is good that the control ending in ME3 is shepard gaining indoctrination powers, that's not problematic at all.
[6:10:34] <+MKUltima> Assuming Direct Control vs. devil on your shoulder whispering in your ear
[6:10:37] <+Soliloquy123> Can anybody grade this game on how well it controls w/ M+KB
[6:10:38] <Doomstar16> He'd be cool if it actually worked though.
[6:10:43] <James_Quivers> We do a little bit of indoctrination
[6:10:44] <aiutare47> the more control a reaper exerts the more it fries your brain I think
[6:10:45] <%maenos2> ...
[6:10:45] <CheekyBirb> @Profmcstevie as a treat
[6:10:48] <%TheWinged7> thats an odd angle
[6:10:48] <Broken_Sonex> @Profmcstevie As a treat
[6:10:49] <Samurai_Tchan> KILL THIS WITCH
[6:10:55] <DatAsuna> very blue paragon power, indoctrination
[6:11:00] <%RetroCop87> TELL ME YOUR PLANS
[6:11:08] <DatAsuna> only the bluest bois
[6:11:10] <RubberFistFight> @aiutare47 yeah. Even just being indoctrinated is enough to completely decimate your mind once they leave.
[6:11:14] <DSD24> Its pretty static
[6:11:15] <%MidnightBurst12> weird camera angle
[6:11:21] <CheekyBirb> bioware camera angles are a thing
[6:11:22] <allanmiri> My favorite version of this trope was in Drakengard 3 when Zero pretended that she was mind controlled or whatever to get her sister to hug and then Zero stabbed her to death while calling her a stupid bitch.
[6:11:24] <MichelangeloStark> these characters are all A-POSING
[6:11:28] <AoG_JarlRaven> Pretty weird angle
[6:11:30] <viewtifulr> put the camera up her ass Like Ann from P5
[6:11:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> What order did the ridiculous crown and titty window come. Before indoctrination or after? Did Sovereign tell her to release the cleave?
[6:11:35] <viewtifulr> Kappa
[6:11:43] <RubberFistFight> "The indoctrination has faded, we can talk, you have to be fast!" <spends the next 3 hours soliloquising>
[6:11:44] <%StaceMcGate> Did Saren make you install the boob window?
[6:12:04] <$RealThiele> booba
[6:12:04] <RubberFistFight> @StaceMcGate Saren paid top dollar for the tiddy job.
[6:12:05] <%MisterRockett> Man her titties look GREAT.
[6:12:07] <+bigcorry> look at this ladies big cartoon teeth, its bothering the shit out of me
[6:12:08] <Samurai_Tchan> thats ONE UGLY ASSARI
[6:12:10] <+vaderxyz1970> Moraly Grey?
[6:12:16] <MichelangeloStark> @goose_attack_almanac the more evil you fall, the more seductive you must become

[6:13:24] <DatAsuna> You say it's funny to kill her mom in front of her, but it's actually funnier to just roll up to her on the ship and drop that you killed her mom.
[6:13:26] <AoG_JarlRaven> Shotgun is so busted
[6:13:29] <RubberFistFight> @wasdsf where's Nifto Cal, Biotic God when you need him?

[6:14:36] <Broken_Sonex> Lol no light, heaven ain't real
[6:14:36] <jackelzxaa> Shepard puts his hand into garrus and liara’s goo to level their stats
[6:14:39] <RubberFistFight> @RealThiele "go milk thing. Yoda want blue milk!"
[6:14:43] <+holyxgrale> How savage would it have been if that was the matriarch instead of some rando
[6:14:46] <allanmiri> Puppet corpse waifu.
[6:14:47] <peachy996> maybe asari don't go to heaven because they're all harlots
[6:14:47] <MichelangeloStark> @goose_attack_almanac i get it I get it

[6:15:18] <yojohny> Wow imagine if this decision actually mattered ever
[6:15:19] <peachy996> This is way more distressing in 3
[6:15:19] <%possumwalsh1221> The voice effect is cool
[6:15:22] <$RealThiele> we are not *happy* *campers*
[6:15:23] <+vaderxyz1970> They don
[6:15:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Music = Color got it

[6:15:27] <Dunmarkh> asari are basically sleeves for other psychics
[6:15:28] <peachy996> Bunch of dying Krogans as the voice
[6:15:31] <Samurai_Tchan> reksai
[6:15:35] <%ingman112> I feel like this should have been Benezia’s body

[6:15:42] <RubberFistFight> PSYCHIC BUG BRAIN SHIT
[6:15:45] <viewtifulr> so do rakni talk like the big dudes?
[6:15:59] <peachy996> Benezia already died this one was dying
[6:16:00] <tanarath> Rachni are so cool
[6:16:03] <RubberFistFight> @ingman112 the queen doesn't have the force power necessary to lift that massive rack.
[6:16:03] <viewtifulr> oh wait nvm
[6:16:07] <Samurai_Tchan> its Sinestesia
[6:16:14] <jackelzxaa> It woulda been wild if it used benezia to deliver this
[6:16:16] <+trackles_64> kill them happily
[6:16:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I remember when they were going to be so fucking cool. Thanks ME3
[6:16:36] <%POUND_CAKE94> Yeah this conversation saves this planet’s story
[6:16:44] <jackelzxaa> Remember how benezia and saren are unique designs for their races with features that never show up again?
[6:16:47] <jackelzxaa> Grunt too
[6:16:51] <+senfood> oh no, the species is actually beautifully empathetic!
[6:16:58] <+D00msDayDan> tags: mind break
[6:16:58] <Broken_Sonex> @ingman112 TOO MUCH BLUE MILK
[6:17:03] <Samurai_Tchan> NO ,DONT
[6:17:03] <peachy996> Example: Jack
[6:17:05] <%Reveresao> KILL FOR DUMD SHIT IN ME3
[6:17:06] <aiutare47> This choice does come up in 3, even if its a bit minor
[6:17:08] <malcobraaklynny> Shepherd, you mind putting a bit more emotion into your lines to match the situation?
[6:17:10] <Samurai_Tchan> DO not extinc
[6:17:19] <%maenos2> LET HER GO
[6:17:21] <tanarath> RELEASE
[6:17:25] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I bet they spent like half their mocap budget on that head shake
[6:17:28] <Goraka91> YEAH BIG TURIAN WAR CRIMES
[6:17:30] <peachy996> I wish I could tell you this choice mattered
[6:17:31] <Samurai_Tchan> noooo clone them
[6:17:32] <+trackles_64> Renegade
[6:17:34] <Samurai_Tchan> use for agriculture
[6:17:34] <CheekyBirb> oh nvm garrus said genocide is good
[6:17:36] <karl_rex> Save the queen
[6:17:38] <peachy996> too bad I can't
[6:17:41] <Samurai_Tchan> domesticate rachini
[6:17:43] <+senfood> THAT WAS ODDLY SPECIFIC, LIARA
[6:17:46] <RubberFistFight> @aiutare47 if you save her here, i think you get them as a war asset in 3.
[6:17:49] <%possumwalsh1221> BE FREE BUG MOM
[6:17:50] <Profmcstevie> RIDE THEM INTO BATTLE
[6:17:51] <yojohny> Don't worry guys. your choices matter
[6:17:58] <Doomstar16> Bugs are pretty cool.
[6:17:59] <%BigCoffee> It's bad in 3 because the writter is a fucking hack
[6:18:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> it honestly doesn't matter....
[6:18:02] <$RealThiele> tee hee no
[6:18:03] <jackelzxaa> Wrex gets pissed if he’s here for this
[6:18:04] <tanarath> It plays out just fine
[6:18:05] <aiutare47> you get them as an Asset but I forget how much its worth
[6:18:11] <DSD24> Oily Shadows
[6:18:13] <malcobraaklynny> This actually matters in 3?
[6:18:16] <Samurai_Tchan> in ME3 they return domesticated to help
[6:18:21] <peachy996> That said I'd rather her live than the alternative you find in 3
[6:18:21] <jackelzxaa> Its worth 100 points
[6:18:25] <$Futurecity10> You get them as an asset in 3 if you save them in 1
[6:18:27] <tanarath> ME3 had a bad writer & pidgeon-holed them
[6:18:30] <karl_rex> Oily shadows just like the visions in 3
[6:18:30] <Jaysky> Yes they can help in 3
[6:18:31] <%BigCoffee> @Samurai_Tchan you still fight some of them
[6:18:31] <Samurai_Tchan> RACHINI good
[6:18:33] <Jaysky> Or hinder
[6:18:33] <yojohny> Fucking ME3
[6:18:33] <allanmiri> You get them as a war asset no matter what you do because the writing in 3 is soooooooo good.
[6:18:36] <feralspidey> NotLikeThis
[6:18:36] <+liquidzr0> they help in 3. wtf
[6:18:42] <Goraka91> The only difference in 3 is you save the queen, again instead of killing the identical clone queen
[6:18:42] <Doomstar16> Spoiler alert, it's good to save em.
[6:18:47] <malcobraaklynny> What happens in 3 if you let them live?
[6:18:48] <%BigCoffee> @allanmiri such sarcasm :p
[6:18:48] <RetributionP> piss note? gross
[6:18:49] <$Futurecity10> If you kill them in 1, then save them in 3 they damage you
[6:18:51] <+senfood> [Glass them]
[6:18:51] <%HairballCT> 🎵 piss note 🎵
[6:18:53] <peachy996> Because she tells you about the rachni in 2 if you leave her alive
[6:18:54] <%AbnormalVoid> Here's a brown note *brap*
[6:18:57] <+storkeylope> Does 3 not have them appear as enemies if you kill her here?
[6:19:03] <%Taisuru> Shoulda brought wrex here
[6:19:05] <+trackles_64> wellp rip  humanity
[6:19:07] <peachy996> So it's at least worth it for that
[6:19:10] <Samurai_Tchan> save queem = free blowjobs
[6:19:13] <Josef_Stryker> I remember Wrex is super salty if he's here
[6:19:15] <+vaderxyz1970> I WILL LET YOU DIE OF GENETIC INBREEDING
[6:19:20] <Doomstar16> See you later bug chan
[6:19:21] <+GuilKato> i feel you should have been able to I will free you but the council will give you a planet to hang out on
[6:19:23] <MichelangeloStark> sing the story of the Shepard!
[6:19:27] <DSD24> By Bug Mom
[6:19:28] <%ramielthe5th> yay
[6:19:28] <Srthunda> he didnt even press the buttons
[6:19:28] <%goose_attack_almanac> @storkeylope 3 has the reapers create a clone. So there's no real repercussions for doing either.
[6:19:29] <tanarath> @storkeylope there are enemies one way or another
[6:19:33] <%miguelrod777> 3 is dumb with the rachni they deserve better
[6:19:35] <tanarath> It's stupid
[6:19:36] <RedPlasticCup> good work pat. saved some bugs.
[6:19:38] <%StaceMcGate> welp the Zerg are back
[6:19:38] <+trackles_64> peace out yall
[6:19:40] <Samurai_Tchan> BYE XENOMORPH
[6:19:41] <James_Quivers> If you let them live, you can recruit in 3. Killing them has a different queen appear who has been affected by the reapers, and saving her in 3 has them turn on you eventually
[6:19:44] <%logoth_> Pargon +23
[6:19:45] <peachy996> You get to meet her later in 2 sort of
[6:19:45] <%shootbang_exe> 3 is very undercooked
[6:19:46] <jackelzxaa> It woulda been rad if killing the queen here meant there were no rachni enemies in 3
[6:19:46] <%Taisuru> LUL
[6:19:47] <%Ranryu692> right in the tits
[6:19:47] <+senfood> The Rachni are gorgeous. I want to date them.
[6:19:48] <$RealThiele> shoo the spider out the door instead of smooshing it
[6:19:49] <allanmiri> Double tap.
[6:19:51] <%ingman112> I love bringing Wrex here b/c he’s like “you fucking serious m8”
[6:19:52] <Vi_Stri> how the heck do they even get off the planet?
[6:19:53] <RubberFistFight> Later on to her children: "Lol this dumb nerd let me go free, you should go eat them all now. Just eat like the whole planet."
[6:19:55] <zenith0111> This is literal the plot of Sentient Psychic Spiders in Rick and Morty
[6:19:55] <heartlesshealer> 3 needed better writing overall
[6:19:58] <RetributionP> I realese you into the subzero atmosphere
[6:19:59] <%logoth_> Mass Effect 3 is very Boneless
[6:20:01] <ioci2112> if you kill them renegade shep has the best answer ever for the turian council member tho
[6:20:04] <%MisterRockett> One of the coolest choices in the game, huh?
[6:20:06] <Alzero83> Double Tap
[6:20:09] <jackelzxaa> 3 had a fucked up dev cycle
[6:20:11] <+balroy> save!
[6:20:12] <+senfood> CALL ME
[6:20:12] <heartlesshealer> I barely know anything about 3 and I know that from what I've gleaned
[6:20:14] <Doomstar16> Rachni are so freaking cool. I wish they did more with them.
[6:20:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> Surprisingly Tali actually wants them to live.
[6:20:22] <ChungusQuest> serve the hive
[6:20:26] <jackelzxaa> Hot labs
[6:20:28] <%GarbageNirvana> @zenith0111 You mean sentient psychic spiders are literally the plot of this
[6:20:29] <Samurai_Tchan> PRO nature
[6:20:31] <jackelzxaa> Did pat do the hot labs yet
[6:20:42] <%Taisuru> Spicy labs
[6:20:43] <viewtifulr> Tali didn't want to genocide any LIVING creatures only robots
[6:20:45] <%ingman112> Gotta do the hot labs
[6:20:47] <jackelzxaa> Pat do the hot labs
[6:20:51] <peachy996> Whats annoying about this decision in 3 is: just don't place the fucking Ravagers in the area if you decided to kill the rachni
[6:20:53] <jackelzxaa> You have one more task
[6:21:01] <peachy996> That's all you had to do
[6:21:07] <tranquilturnip> he looks photoshopped onto that chair
[6:21:12] <%luftraumm1> what a beautiful face
[6:21:14] <Samurai_Tchan> im here to release aliens
[6:21:14] <Goraka91> They are inventing a THYME MACHINE
[6:21:20] <chancho4tierra> what happens to the rachni in mass effect 3 i dont remember
[6:21:22] <zenith0111> @garbagenirvana Yes because Dan Harmon has talked about Mass Effect A LOT
[6:21:23] <DSD24> That's a shit excuse
[6:21:30] <malcobraaklynny> he looks kind of like H3H3
[6:21:36] <jackelzxaa> I think the dungeon town is now inaccessible
[6:21:41] <jackelzxaa> Wow his hair is different
[6:22:01] <+D00msDayDan> literally weyland-utani
[6:22:01] <RubberFistFight> "YER MUH KHWEEN"

[6:30:08] <sora2025> anitaGasm
[6:30:08] <jackelzxaa> He killed everyone
[6:30:10] <%CatastropheCorvid> He's marrying Paige, I don't think he's unwilling to commit.
[6:30:20] <Samurai_Tchan> who designed crazy talk ?
[6:30:20] <AdamLon4> Ashley's racism infiltrating pat
[6:30:25] <+bassforte123> Ashley's pulling out her racisim double talk to confuse you
[6:30:26] <jackelzxaa> Pat and Ashley sitting in a tree, being  r a c i s t
[6:30:26] <%dekkitout> Let's review: Pros - sent the council to voicemail, Cons - made the blussy sad. Questions, comments, concerns?
[6:30:31] <%sunsetdisc0> aw man I missed the last couple streams. pat saved ash?
[6:30:39] <%Taisuru> I can't believe Pat hates Liara and loves Ashley
[6:30:53] <+balroy> those boobs are out of control
[6:30:57] <%StaceMcGate> @sunsetdisc0 I'm pretty sure he is sparing her to kill her himself in 3
[6:30:59] <Profmcstevie> time to pivot to racism I guess usedFeels
[6:31:02] <peachy996> I for one commend your effort in making Liara sad. first you kill her mom and now you yell at her
[6:31:07] <mak0t0yukii> Can't believe liking liara was a myth
[6:31:14] <Josef_Stryker> Man, Pat *really* has it out for Ash.
[6:31:16] <+bassforte123> @sunsetdisc0 A talking prompt didn't specify who Shepard would be yelling at, so pat yelled at Liara when he was trying to yell at Ashley
[6:31:23] <peachy996> Can't wait for Thessia with Javik
[6:31:27] <%sunsetdisc0> @stacemcgate that's what I was thinking
[6:32:41] <peachy996> It's fine Liara will still sploosh herself extra hard because you yelled at her
[6:32:44] <sora2025> love that relode
[6:33:07] <sora2025> I think its from Monkey Ball?
[6:33:52] <allanmiri> You know what's funny? If you play as FemShep and romance Kaiden in ME1, but someone else in ME2 and dump Kaiden in ME3, FemShep brother zones his ass super hard.
