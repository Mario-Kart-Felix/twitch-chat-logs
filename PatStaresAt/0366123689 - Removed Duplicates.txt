[0:03:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @AngriestPat Just want to let you know that the 6th mission "Long Day" that you stopped at last stream is actually possible using standard missiles only but it's hard to do, so my recommendation is grind for a better plane so you can have an easier time
[0:03:51] <$NocturneNovember> Which game had the live-action scenes everyone references?
[0:03:51] <$Brother_Coduss> @callsigneagle01 i...havent made top gun references. i've never even seen top gun....if you're talking about when i said i wish pat would use the gun more, i legitimately meant that. missles seem easy mode
[0:03:52] <AggsMK7> lol
[0:03:53] <lionmanguy> Kinda. You mean from story perspective or gameplay, because I fully accept I wont understand story
[0:03:54] <+uncledickbutt> paypal was a mistake

[0:15:25] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @AngriestPat Just want to let you know that the 6th mission "Long Day" that you stopped at last stream is actually possible using standard missiles only but it's hard to do, so my recommendation is grind for a better plane so you can have an easier time

[0:19:04] <lionmanguy> Remember ti maintain air superiority
[0:19:05] <+jkfd> just to compare I checked out a video of a guy playing falcon 4.0 yesterday. he spent what felt like 20 minutes going through a launch checklist and flipping switches in the cockpit before waiting another 10 minutes for the tower to give him permission to take off
[0:19:05] <%vaporousTippler> My god. Watching Pat without having to hear him. Is such a thing possible?
[0:19:05] <Squirtydirtturd> I hated FF10
[0:19:06] <%stolando_florida> @callsigneagle01 0311 is marines, 11B is army
[0:19:06] <dominichokage> it's aces combat!
[0:19:06] <%Eaglestrike117> i can tell you that
[0:19:06] <alrobot2014> @callsigneagle01 so is the result an impassable wall of debris and nuclear waste?
[0:19:06] <Inglonias> lrrFINE dasNASA
[0:19:06] <%YabbaTroll> is this a game that i could use a flight stick and have fun?

[0:19:07] <%Skullgonian> @thatguyfrommars Is there perhaps a delay on it?
[0:19:08] <daedri> Man that A10 turned on a time.
[0:19:08] <max_powerfist> Feels like an Ace Combat game that's trying to be an Ace Combat game, smh.
[0:19:09] <OToole42> pats having us all edge with umpending BRRRT
[0:19:10] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat are there landing gameplay sequences?

[0:19:21] <AggsMK7> Bong
[0:19:21] <%Typhaeon> Use LastPass & 2FA
[0:19:25] <privatesargent> its slow speed, sharp turning, and great endurance means the A10 can fly into the center of a base and just lay waste to everything, like Pat is doing right now
[0:19:25] <The_Blumper> I dont want to be lewd but the A-10 really makes me wet
[0:19:26] <420moneymoney69> Army doesn’t have the same MOS number as us

[0:19:52] <callsigneagle01> Remember when the USAF said they wanted to drop the A-10 and the army said they'd buy it if they did and they walked right the fuck back?
[0:19:53] <%FrostMass22> I'll try spinning, that's a good trick
[0:19:54] <rufus2k2> can you change the color of jets? I'd paint the A-10 blue to appeal to my GI Joe Nostalgia
[0:19:54] <callsigneagle01> start with 4

[0:21:49] <%TheSpiritof2277> YEYEYEYE
[0:21:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Why are they so amazed that drones are a thing when they have a SPACE ELEVATOR
[0:21:50] <%joylent_blue> BRRRRRRT BabyRage
[0:21:51] <%ArtemisM822> Agreed. The music is awesome
[0:21:53] <SpeedFetishist> Hey Pat, there's a unique dialogue from your wingmen if you fly through a tunnel in this stage
[0:21:53] <TheEnablerr> what is this flying god
[0:21:54] <%Shady_Zaku> So how's Pat liking the game so far?
[0:21:54] <+Cyoctane> Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
[0:21:55] <HiddenPorpoise> You are a gun with wings, use the gun
[0:21:56] <%TheSpiritof2277> The spread is beautiful

[0:21:59] <%Eaglestrike117> Sparrow
[0:21:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Skullgonian nice nice. it should be in your connections tab in settings and it would be under sub-enabled servers
[0:22:00] <thelonechris> Looks like Arizona
[0:22:00] <%Eaglestrike117> Especially when you are dodging AA fire
[0:22:03] <Blank9> the autocannon's louder in cockpit view I think
[0:22:05] <%Eaglestrike117> Its so fuckin good
[0:22:05] <ArcticAsylum> Use that infamous A-10 Chain Gun man
[0:22:05] <callsigneagle01> Pat just remember you WILL be fighting drones later in the mission
[0:22:06] <max_powerfist> AC7 comes out, buys a Japanese PS2 and copy of AC3 and plays that instead - Me
[0:22:07] <%Eaglestrike117> Standard controls you dont have roll
[0:22:07] <subjectg> @Eaglestrike117 the one with the canards? do they at least have the SE?
[0:22:07] <yourliteraldog> Can you only use butt junk tier lane planes
[0:22:07] <%bruhimnotarobot> i didnt know Pats flying an A-10
[0:22:08] <%joylent_blue> Shady_Zaku i believe his wording was "fucking radical"
[0:22:08] <privatesargent> the gun is a little muted, but i can still here the BRRRRRT
[0:22:09] <Gruhunchously> @dominichokage This game has fantasy everything. The things from the real world are the planes.
[0:22:09] <callsigneagle01> Remember that different targets have different point values, so pick out the juciest ones
[0:22:09] <%Eaglestrike117> Putting maunverabily on an A10 is like strapping some wings to a gu--oh wait what they did that already
[0:22:09] <TalisKanju> So does @Moobot shout that much or is it Pat saying that?
[0:22:10] <Red_5_Alpha> speed boosting on an A-10 is a waste
[0:22:10] <callsigneagle01> and they will fuck you up in this
[0:22:11] <+SideswipePrime606> Aw man AC music is still great
[0:22:11] <DarkKnightGrave> I GOT THE NEED
[0:22:12] <%lewdskeletor13> @shady_zaku He’s basically cumming over it

[0:24:11] <$2Metronomes> That guy threatens solitary a lot
[0:24:11] <dominichokage> *sense
[0:24:11] <subjectg> fly through that tunnel
[0:24:11] <privatesargent> great thing about the A10, you can fly EXTREMELY slowly and make incredibly sharp turns
[0:24:12] <TalisKanju> @ThatGuyfromMars makes sense
[0:24:12] <%Bt_Robot> Do you feel them crawling on your back?
[0:24:12] <%Eaglestrike117> No lewd
[0:24:12] <%Laecerelius> Perfectly calibrated bombing run!
[0:24:12] <%lizard0tm> Game too quiet, I can't hear the BRRRRRRRRRRRRT
[0:24:14] <masterfire23> where is my ace combat mecha game SwiftRage
[0:24:15] <yourliteraldog> Tell us how much chair force sucks
[0:24:16] <%Eaglestrike117> This is AREA FUCKING 88
[0:24:16] <rufus2k2> @lewdskeletor13 more like dirty Dozen
[0:24:16] <%nelsonq415> in the real world, how many mithles could the warthog actually carry?
[0:24:16] <%Skullgonian> So is Ace Combat a high school melodrama in a plane based combat set dressing?
[0:24:17] <CassandraSaturn> nice. i just became your first deaf follower @AngriestPat YOU'RE WELCOME LUL
[0:24:17] <$Brother_Coduss> THIS IS BEST PLANE
[0:24:17] <+KSabot> cuttin it close
[0:24:18] <TheEnablerr> "Leprechaun has destroyed the base"
[0:24:20] <Polengoldur> there's something so un-sportsman like about shooting landed birds
[0:24:20] <Captain_Joe1911> Go Paaat notekHug
[0:24:22] <%rytisone> Michael Bay it up

[0:24:23] <%joylent_blue> SuiZideD gotta do what you gotta do o7
[0:24:24] <%joylent_blue> SirBrawler18 pats loving it
[0:24:24] <%snow_bush> CHONK
[0:24:24] <Dakuu75> this mission doesn't look like it needs a jet, it needs a bomber with cluster bombs eqquiped
[0:24:26] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Skullgonian okay so link your discord with your twitch and it should show up as an invite, you may have to restart discord
[0:24:26] <callsigneagle01> God those drones are gonna fuck you
[0:24:27] <a_mad_dragon> it's not like he's gonna run out though
[0:24:27] <%cvp5127> B I G
[0:24:27] <%lewdskeletor13> KILL THEM ALL
[0:24:28] <Forces45> Yes let me talk about breaking into military documents on an open channel
[0:24:28] <ScreamingMeat> So how do they make sure you don't fuck off with the plane?
[0:24:31] <+AlopekisPup> PAT
[0:24:32] <defectivefire718> @patzzki217 but more than one missle is more FUN i say
[0:24:32] <+Shohinzo> High roller dies two minutes ago bandogs like "wake up slackers!"
[0:24:32] <AlfredoChicken> High Roller :(
[0:24:33] <%CharileMurphyPendelton> Aim High... Air Force
[0:24:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Except for tanks, those takes 2 MSL
[0:24:33] <privatesargent> bombing runs are so satisfying
[0:24:34] <Tucker0603> LOOK aT THIS BIG BOOTIED BITCH!
[0:24:35] <%Eaglestrike117> i can tell you it only gets more area 88 as the game goes on
[0:24:35] <Polengoldur> ok how is that even a competition? Trigger shot down the president while he was surrounded by a fleet of allies. Trigger is 100% the best
[0:24:37] <%Stratiotai2> So the best explanation for this game I have ever heard is its just metal gear with jets
[0:24:38] <dekkitout> leprechaun is the perfect call sign for pat LUL
[0:24:40] <SuiZideD> Sleeping @joylent_blue LUL
[0:24:41] <%Eaglestrike117> Yes
[0:24:41] <Polengoldur> so whens the next mission with an Arsenal Gear?
[0:24:41] <%lewdskeletor13> @rufus2k2 I meant the comic, not the movie
[0:24:41] <%nelsonq415> does 1st person offer more points?
[0:24:41] <ScreamingMeat> 1k left, 1k left
[0:24:41] <HiddenPorpoise> You have insane gun range, just linger on yaw
[0:24:41] <$nademonkey1100> LOUDER BRRRRT please
[0:24:42] <%Bt_Robot> Pull up, pull up ground warning!
[0:24:43] <%Taisuru> MANUAL LAND COWARD
[0:24:43] <callsigneagle01> @stolando_florida also were you 0311 or something else?
[0:24:45] <%Eaglestrike117> That is correct
[0:24:49] <%Eaglestrike117> Uhhh
[0:24:49] <rufus2k2> @lewdskeletor13 Noice~
[0:24:50] <%TheSpiritof2277> Not enough BRRRRRRRT FREEDOM noises
[0:24:51] <%Eaglestrike117> Its a while
[0:24:51] <+TastySammiches> why your plane got a big fat ass
[0:24:51] <Polengoldur> @HiddenPorpoise DMG meter buttom right
[0:24:52] <%vaporousTippler> My god. Watching Pat without having to hear him. Is such a thing possible?
[0:24:52] <+jkfd> just to compare I checked out a video of a guy playing falcon 4.0 yesterday. he spent what felt like 20 minutes going through a launch checklist and flipping switches in the cockpit before waiting another 10 minutes for the tower to give him permission to take off
[0:24:53] <%Eaglestrike117> i can tell you that
[0:24:53] <%stolando_florida> @callsigneagle01 0311 is marines, 11B is army
[0:24:53] <dominichokage> it's aces combat!
[0:24:54] <%LogothX> Eagle 20, Fox 2
[0:24:54] <%Skullgonian> @thatguyfrommars Is there perhaps a delay on it?
[0:24:55] <daedri> Man that A10 turned on a time.
[0:24:55] <max_powerfist> Feels like an Ace Combat game that's trying to be an Ace Combat game, smh.
[0:24:57] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat are there landing gameplay sequences?
[0:24:58] <%Typhaeon> Smash that base like it's a Like button Kappa
[0:24:59] <dominichokage> thats a beautiful rendered plane
[0:24:59] <+AlopekisPup> Get your booty in gear
[0:24:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Skullgonian its more like gundam but instead of giant robots it's jets
[0:24:59] <%Nobrev> fuck you bandog
[0:24:59] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat just nuke the site from orbit, its the only way to be sure
[0:25:00] <Gruhunchously> I know
[0:25:00] <+Skatedeandre> The president is like 5 billion points
[0:25:00] <daedri> dime even.
[0:25:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat-titles
[0:25:02] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL Pat wtf
[0:25:03] <Fordlotus> Hey guys , can you change the dub of this game ?
[0:25:03] <%Eaglestrike117> @AngriestPat I'll give you a hint when it comes to ground targets, if you hit just one of oil or fuel tanks, it sets off a chain reaction and they all go up in smoke
[0:25:03] <AggsMK7> Ouchies
[0:25:03] <DevilShadowQc> tangBRAA BRRRRRT
[0:25:03] <%nelsonq415> use your cannon
[0:25:05] <%umbypokochan> this is just Star Fox with people
[0:25:06] <$awsomesaucekirby> "Dancing angels..."
[0:25:07] <%Eaglestrike117> Yes
[0:25:07] <callsigneagle01> Fug sorry, I forget it changes with the army @stolando_florida
[0:25:08] <AggsMK7> Bong
[0:25:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> ! Plane at risk !
[0:25:09] <%joylent_blue> the A-10 got a big sexy ass you mean
[0:25:12] <The_Blumper> I dont want to be lewd but the A-10 really makes me wet
[0:25:12] <privatesargent> its slow speed, sharp turning, and great endurance means the A10 can fly into the center of a base and just lay waste to everything, like Pat is doing right now
[0:25:13] <420moneymoney69> Army doesn’t have the same MOS number as us
[0:25:15] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Bandog's like "don't pretend like you're not supposed to die, don't forget what you are"
[0:25:15] <%lewdskeletor13> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:25:15] <yourliteraldog> use combo
[0:25:15] <+d00msdaydan> give me BRRRRT or give me death
[0:25:17] <+KSabot> He cutting it reeeeaaal close
[0:25:17] <%snow_bush> Ah, the sweet siren son of target locks
[0:25:18] <$Brother_Coduss> this one mission is making me want this game. the thunderbolt is just so fucking COOL
[0:25:18] <%Bt_Robot> It's a bug hunt.
[0:25:19] <%Eaglestrike117> Theres a JP Sound track
[0:25:19] <%Hazard_Kujacker> B A R R E L R O L K
[0:25:20] <%waddledoops> hey this game looks p good
[0:25:20] <Reanimator83> Pat needs to play the Air Wolf intro music while playing this
[0:25:21] <%CharileMurphyPendelton> que the Tom Cruise documentary Top Gun
[0:25:21] <Mangahero18> @vaporousTippler It sounds too good to be true.
[0:25:23] <Gruhunchously> @The_Blumper Same
[0:25:23] <%GohanEgret> @The_Blumper l ... lewd
[0:25:23] <lionmanguy> Almost there
[0:25:24] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> I loved manual landing in Unsung War. God that was so cool for some reason!
[0:25:25] <+Shohinzo> Damn this game is gorgeous
[0:25:26] <Polengoldur> landing is always t he hardest part of a flight sim
[0:25:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Star Fox with less furries
[0:25:27] <Josef_Stryker> Landleing
[0:25:27] <The_Blumper> @TastySammiches Fat bottom girls make the rockin world go 'round
[0:25:28] <Forces45> Like fish in a barrel
[0:25:29] <%lizard0tm> @AngriestPat turn the sound fx up, can't hear that sexy BRRRT
[0:25:30] <tungstenviper> @AngriestPat G R E A T
[0:25:30] <Worldbrand> Oh good im not the only one stuck on this mission
[0:25:31] <%NovaKnightmare> I want to become a pilot solely so I can BRRRRT
[0:25:31] <saberknight_> fuck this game looks rad
[0:25:31] <dominichokage> i think the computer is trying to tell you "missile"
[0:25:31] <%lewdskeletor13> BREAK!
[0:25:32] <+moondog_> @tastysammiches because if it didnt the gun that is attached to would literally propellant the opposite direction
[0:25:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Make sure you shoot down enemies over civilian areas
[0:25:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Those are some big bombs
[0:25:35] <+moondog_> start using the gun on that bitch
[0:25:36] <%Eaglestrike117> This isnt a flight sim
[0:25:36] <callsigneagle01> Star Fox with better flying
[0:25:36] <420moneymoney69> He means infantry
[0:25:37] <AggsMK7> Anakin killed LANDLINGS
[0:25:37] <+SWFanatic> Fox! Help me!
[0:25:37] <Madbearv> did pat die yet
[0:25:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Changing dubs is for cowards
[0:25:39] <callsigneagle01> Remember when the USAF said they wanted to drop the A-10 and the army said they'd buy it if they did and they walked right the fuck back?
[0:25:40] <Blank9> if you think this is cool you haven't seen anything yet
[0:25:40] <%FrostMass22> I'll try spinning, that's a good trick
[0:25:41] <rufus2k2> can you change the color of jets? I'd paint the A-10 blue to appeal to my GI Joe Nostalgia
[0:25:41] <%GohanEgret> missile!
[0:25:41] <Nazgul240> gonna lose again bc of the drones
[0:25:42] <%Eaglestrike117> stop calling it a flight sim
[0:25:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Skullgonian it's possible
[0:25:42] <%badmr7> suck it drone
[0:25:42] <defectivefire718> @max_powerfist mani hate it when games try to be what they are

[0:25:51] <Vozati> the explosions in this game are so good
[0:25:51] <%Eaglestrike117> nah he made it
[0:25:51] <420moneymoney69> An A10 would never take out air targets
[0:25:51] <Heartless_01> hows the multiplayer?
[0:25:52] <callsigneagle01> @rufus2k2 you can in the hangar
[0:25:52] <privatesargent> this right here is why the A10 rules
[0:25:52] <marsano168> when I think of manual landing I get bad Pilot Wings for snes flashbacks

[0:30:03] <%nelsonq415> in the real world, how many mithles could the warthog actually carry?
[0:30:03] <%Skullgonian> So is Ace Combat a high school melodrama in a plane based combat set dressing?

[0:30:07] <%brave_sj> I mean, what did you do? Are you a murderer?
[0:30:08] <%snow_bush> If you didn't want to deal with him you shouldn't have killed the president.

[0:30:11] <Dakuu75> this mission doesn't look like it needs a jet, it needs a bomber with cluster bombs eqquiped
[0:30:11] <The_Blumper> I think Trigger was framed

[0:31:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Changing dubs is for cowards
[0:31:26] <callsigneagle01> Remember when the USAF said they wanted to drop the A-10 and the army said they'd buy it if they did and they walked right the fuck back?

[1:40:01] <$Tuskor13> the gas is super great, as someone with shit teeth, i can tell you that that gas is fucking top tier high
[1:40:01] <$avarice99> ive only had wisdom tooth yanked, didnt need surgery, just took 30 minutes with a syringe and my doc

[1:40:02] <%nyghtmare42> I just got numbed and yankedfor my wisdom teeth. damn.
[1:40:02] <%cureneckbeard> Ginger people are more likely to have the gene that makes them resist the pain drug they use at the dentist

[3:04:55] <%topendbuzz> this is why you need air to ship
[3:04:57] <%Eaglestrike117> @AngriestPat Frigates take 2, Destoryers take 3, Cruisers take 4, Aegis's take 5

[3:05:20] <BlitzChocula> I would hate to be on a boat during an airstrike.
[3:05:21] <Tucker0603> air to ship hits it out faster

[3:05:33] <geekjacob> no not outer heaven
[3:05:35] <dominichokage> yaaay mildly encouraging AWACS

[3:05:45] <+twilightwing66> @timblenaut this intel guy likes foosd
[3:05:45] <%Keyd00d> BURG
[3:05:45] <%lewdskeletor13> The dialogue is hilarious, but the narrative is so frustrating
[3:05:45] <Gruhunchously> Sandwich? You just made that saying up!
[3:05:46] <%MaiHusbando9S> a burger is a sandwich
[3:05:48] <poweredscoot> Can you fly through those platforms
[3:05:50] <%kiiiirsten> I'll put the meat between YOUR buns
[3:05:50] <LurkerMkIV> Hamburger is a sandwich though.
[3:05:51] <d_jay_o> You CAN fly through them actually
[3:05:51] <%LtThunderbolt> mmms sandwiches
[3:05:52] <%Divryne> FOOD PUNS.
[3:05:52] <callsigneagle01> So this AWACS likes food
[3:05:53] <marsano168> yeah food analogies!
[3:05:53] <BlitzChocula> well-done.
[3:05:53] <+LandOfTheWay> Kaz? Is that you?
[3:05:56] <%Remery_> No it's not
[3:05:57] <Estuko> does anyone remember that tunnel flying mission in AC Unsung War and the anxiety that formed lmao
[3:05:57] <MasterTonberry23> FLying a plane through a tight space? This is Ace Combat all right.
[3:05:57] <Thalchampz> >superiour numbers LUL
[3:05:59] <%snow_bush> MORE CORPSES
[3:06:01] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Is Long Caster just gonna keep talking about food the entire game?
[3:06:01] <Coystick> A burger is NOT a sandwich
[3:06:01] <Dakuu75> why is he getting so close? lol
[3:06:04] <callsigneagle01> Is this Perrault's kid?
[3:06:04] <Shastafield> this is the weakest army ever omg
[3:06:07] <%joylent_blue> i can't believe we're bombing outer heaven
[3:06:11] <crusader_heide> rut took u so wrong
[3:06:13] <Gruhunchously> NEEEEaawwww
[3:06:17] <marsano168> A burger toally counts as a sandwich
[3:06:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Motherbase is doomed
[3:06:18] <%LtThunderbolt> yaaaww
[3:06:19] <%Keyd00d> YAW
[3:06:20] <Tucker0603> shoulda brought A10 BAR

[3:06:23] <callsigneagle01> @Eaglestrike117 Hey how many more missions are there?
[3:06:26] <MasterTonberry23> Enemy radar spike!
[3:06:27] <AlasterAngelo> why are we still here
[3:06:27] <%Eaglestrike117> 21
[3:06:27] <tungstenviper> Defeating a sandwhich only makes it tasteir
[3:06:28] <Jack8274> LUL
[3:06:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> A burger is a Specialized Sandwich. A Sandwich is just a starter class.
[3:06:30] <%LtThunderbolt> YAW yaw
[3:06:30] <Pilzkun> nice
[3:06:33] <$Brother_Coduss> Wait, did Tabloid get killed off?
[3:06:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> 90 degree homing, nice
[3:06:36] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @Coystick this is the sandwich alignment chart all over again
[3:06:37] <A_Zealous_Retort> YEAh do that Immelmann turn
[3:06:38] <Jack8274> Tokyo drift
[3:06:40] <d_jay_o> Lv1 Sandwich, Lv50 Burger?
[3:06:41] <%Eaglestrike117> no tabloids alive
[3:06:44] <pillowwasp> @dirtydeedsdundirtcheap it’s not an anime without a character obsessed with food
[3:06:45] <+Thorn14> Tabloid was sent to another frontline
[3:06:46] <ThatManSam> A burger can count as a sandwich but it depends what is acting as the bun
[3:06:47] <crusader_heide> stay frosty pat
[3:06:48] <%lewdskeletor13> @garbagequeenellie This is the best way to think about it
[3:06:50] <ebonifragaria> @GarbageQueenEllie So Burger is a prestige class?
[3:06:50] <%sparrrow_> Pat is the pull up/out king
[3:06:54] <yourliteraldog> Oh shit war crimes
[3:06:55] <%joylent_blue> Tabloid lives on in our hearts
[3:06:55] <%Eaglestrike117> Trigger and count got promoted, the rest of the squadron are at tyler
[3:06:56] <ThatManSam> those brioche buns disqualify it as a sandwich
[3:06:57] <MasterTonberry23> That one plane is doing all the work! Someone shoot that guy down!
[3:06:57] <Gruhunchously> We're targeting non-combatants now.
[3:06:58] <AnimeJedi25> Does anyone else feel like playing Rogue Squadron from watching this?
[3:07:03] <Coystick> @marsano168 cease your communist lies, sandwich apologist
[3:07:07] <dominichokage> THE ENEMY HIND
[3:07:07] <+misterfistor> lol helicopters
[3:07:09] <Estuko> Also confirmation I heard someone say COOP was in here but I'm also not seeing anything about it
[3:07:10] <yourliteraldog> It is mother bas
[3:07:11] <Estuko> ???
[3:07:13] <+Thorn14> You gotta be equal
[3:07:14] <%Eaglestrike117> Pat doesnt even realise how mant points he needs
[3:07:18] <$Brother_Coduss> oh god why did we get stuck with shitlord count instead of someone who's NOT an asshole
[3:07:19] <%Eaglestrike117> you need 25K here
[3:07:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> @ebonifragaria Yes- think of Cheeseburgers as dual-wield, and hamburger as fencing
[3:07:27] <KaleidoKey> did they say "non-combatants"
[3:07:28] <%joylent_blue> "pull up, stupid"
[3:07:30] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @pillowwasp So I'd totally be that character if life was an anime is what you're saying? Because I could go for some empanadas right now...
[3:07:31] <Gruhunchously> That 'pull up' sounds so much like Paige it's freaking me out.
[3:07:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm not sure if the targets that dies from the platform falling on them contributes to the score or not
[3:07:33] <+Bloodxb> because hes the second best
[3:07:35] <BayowolfTerra> i will say this story bounces around characters way more than previous ones did. from what i remember.
[3:07:38] <MasterTonberry23> So if Pat is in Strider squadron, is the enemy rival squadron gonna be Grandmaster?
[3:07:38] <Gwyndellyn> VoHiYo Pull Up VoHiYo Pull Up VoHiYo
[3:07:41] <%Eaglestrike117> Which is WHY i stressed A2S missiles, cause you fucking need em here
[3:07:42] <+Thorn14> This is the mission I left off at, I'm at work now FeelsBadNow
[3:07:42] <Canti58> the last ace combat game i played was 2 and this looks like the same thing, how does this series continue?
[3:07:45] <$Brother_Coduss> @KaleidoKey shhhhhhhhhh
[3:07:45] <d_jay_o> Coop isn't in Multiplayer yet; there's only Team Deathmatch and Battle Royale modes
[3:07:45] <+Thorn14> FeelsBadMan
[3:07:54] <%ElenaManetta> I keep thinking that it's Paige whispering pull up, missile, caution every ten seconds off to the side
[3:07:55] <MoulesFritz> maybe if pat wasn't using weak ass air to air he'd need less hits
[3:08:03] <Coystick> Bun makes a burger, bread makes a sandwich, we live in a society.
[3:08:04] <%sparrrow_> pretty up good?
[3:08:05] <Gruhunchously> I'm the chef this time. Gotta serve up those sandwiches.
[3:08:07] <%Hilleltaco> That was a good words pat
[3:08:07] <+D3rrtyD4n> pretty up dawg
[3:08:08] <+zaworldo> PRETTY UP GOOD
[3:08:09] <+Thorn14> Yup, Air to Ship would fuck those ships up hard

[3:08:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ElenaManetta stop. now I'm hearing it
[3:08:16] <%joylent_blue> now Paige will actually start whispering just to fuck with us
[3:08:17] <poweredscoot> Pretty Up Good
[3:08:18] <AlasterAngelo> what

[3:08:38] <%InsaneJackLondon> is a quesadilla a sandwich?
[3:08:39] <+Thorn14> No you need Multirole for this
[3:08:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige: "...Shoot your teammates, Trigger"
[3:08:43] <DracaenaLeaf> paige keeps telling pat to pull up /s
[3:08:44] <+Thorn14> *Multorle

[3:08:47] <+Thorn14> MULTI.ROLE.
[3:08:47] <%Eaglestrike117> he should have used the FA 18 with air to LASM's
[3:08:48] <%TheYellowcouch> mod in Paige in the game

[3:08:50] <%TheSpiritof2277> Paige doing ghost-voice work
[3:08:53] <%Eaglestrike117> so he can one hit ships
[3:08:55] <%Keyd00d> If it was paige it'd be "pull out" Kappa
