[0:01:28] <stolando_florida> Aw man Remnant is such a good game. I've played it like 5 times through already
[0:01:38] <+Katoma_115> KomodoHype
[0:01:42] <foxhounder29> ja rule to show up on stream?
[0:01:43] <zv1neda> @stolando_florida IT'S SO GOOD
[0:01:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh damn, is Pat going to be playing it for the first time?

[0:02:17] <%Frost_Quill> So I've heard this is Dark Souls but with GUN. And not in the same way Bloodborne was.

[0:02:22] <@lewdskeletor13> @ssaryn Binch
[0:02:25] <stolando_florida> I beat remnant in 13 hours in my first run but the meme is that things are randomized per run so you can't COMPLETE it in 1 run
[0:02:37] <jubejube56> Saying gun souls is a one way ticket to eternal damnation
[0:02:40] <%Calek> this has very little to do with Dark Souls in all honesty
[0:02:44] <stolando_florida> I've put in 46 hours into Remnant so far
[0:02:52] <%Lithdoran> @lewdskeletor13 I don't mean the stream is early, but it's just early for me, since I work third shifts
[0:02:52] <%PaladinDupre> Jim Sterling didnt like Remnant
[0:02:53] <+griffball13> i am curious about this game
[0:02:57] <xxafrodragonxx> What is this game?
[0:02:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Dark souls invented video games
[0:03:02] <SilverFaustX> wow eu friendly stream
[0:03:04] <zv1neda> the zones are randomly generated so each time you go through you'll encounter different bosses and enemies and sometimes different npcs
[0:03:06] <@lewdskeletor13> @lithdoran Ah gotcha
[0:03:11] <%Calek> some quirks maybe like loading screen item descriptions

[0:20:19] <%Frost_Quill> Wait, he says "Claud" like "Clode?"
[0:20:22] <%VanaSkiller> he MUST mean clode
[0:20:22] <%BestTeaMaker> no
[0:20:22] <AMajorTom> If you lived in Montreal you would understand, though
[0:20:23] <EuropanLamprey> Agree to disagree Pat
[0:20:24] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat quick question what do you use to clean your controlers?
[0:20:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> dump on woolie stream
[0:20:26] <devanmuse> I can at least understand GaskWANG because the french language is fucky, but how does he even come to the conclusion that claude is pronounced CLODE?
[0:20:26] <DatAsuna> Tikka is an underrated slip
[0:20:26] <%happyface699> NOO woolie
[0:20:26] <Tomschiii> i mean gascwagne

[0:20:27] <Dest_121> claude tells you his name like right after you meet him

[0:20:48] <%hntronium> NO LONGER FRIENDS
[0:20:52] <DatAsuna> he was too scaed frm 100 episode of forgetting the triangle in TMS FE
[0:20:53] <+PenmanLupine> no its just a Woolie's stubbornness thing
[0:20:57] <IntrepidEye> to be fair I've seen FE vets not realize the triangle wasn't in until many hours in
[0:20:57] <%yet_another_brony> dewit
[0:20:58] <%ColonelRozum> oh we will
[0:20:58] <Zebroneath> Probably because of Tokyo Mirage Sessions
[0:21:00] <%TwinBat> CBT
[0:21:00] <@commanderclaw> Depends on how passive aggressive Woolie feels
[0:21:03] <%AncelDeLambert> it's not hard, they're so huge and exposed

[0:21:03] <%TheDullaMAN> The Ball Busting COMMENCES!
[0:21:03] <%SergeantSov> We desire the busted bawls
[0:21:03] <+aivalera> Because everyone screamed at him about the weapon triangle in #fe
[0:21:11] <ShichiNoBushi> Weapon Triangle was a notable feature of the Fire Emblem games, so I would expect a newcomer to at least have heard about it.
[0:21:18] <%zamzoph> I have a feeling Woolie isn't going to react well to the video
[0:21:19] <DatAsuna> to be fair ti was real rough in the FE LP
[0:21:19] <JMSkiiboskii> PAT DONT LOOK NOW

[0:42:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 The zones, dungeons, bosses, and events you get in your campaign are randomized. You can always reroll the campaign for a shot at new stuff, as a semi new game +, because it's always scaling. All equips and traits are gotten from one specific place, so you'll need to reroll or jump in multiplayer to get and do everything.

[0:52:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @absolute_weapon Apocalypse happened in 60s
[0:52:39] <rytisone> lock on is for pussies
[0:52:40] <xeros720> souls like with guns
[0:52:41] <sjcodan> I'd big reccomend mouse and keyboard

[0:52:43] <%Lammchen> Lammchen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Wahoo 5 months! Thanks for keeping me company all this time when I’m bored out of my mind, keep being rad. Quick question for priorities, should I finish FE:3H or Shadowbringers first?
[0:52:45] <%Doruben> not a melee game
[0:52:47] <TheVampiricVamp> No lock on, only LOCK OFF
[0:52:48] <Doomed2Die> it kinda plays like RE mercenaries tbh
[0:52:50] <+Sindellah> does he know there's guns in this game? Cause there's no need for a lock on later/
[0:52:50] <%megabrogus> he wants a lock on in a shooter
[0:52:51] <%ColonelRozum> not a mele game
[0:52:52] <%nmaten> this looks clunky like lords of the fallen
[0:52:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Probably no lock on because it's mostly guns
[0:52:54] <borous> this is not a melee focused game
[0:52:58] <FalseEyeD> Shadowbringers first
[0:52:58] <rosemon5001> @gigacanuck impossible we must be on mass coke
[0:53:00] <%ColonelRozum> its a shooter @AngriestPat

[0:53:19] <xeros720> this code vein prequel looks pretty good
[0:53:20] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[0:53:23] <sjcodan> Its Resident Evil Souls
[0:53:25] <gigacanuck> @wolfofsound that would be the sun

[1:23:17] <+Pookiedaexzile> and she go the biker gloves
[1:23:18] <flatty1000> looks kind of cheap
[1:23:20] <RantingRavager> Or snuff it out and usher in an age of darkness
[1:23:22] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat this game has souls borne lore in the items like clothes and guns
[1:23:23] <flatty1000> and not the good kind of cheap
[1:23:27] <transporterthesequel> Privy return to the walking sands
[1:23:31] <+Rezca> *note: Do not give Pat a gun
[1:23:31] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @AngriestPat just a heads up most big bosses have an alternate kill condition that drops a different boss weapon
[1:23:31] <sjcodan> @s_deep Thats not the MASTER key, you get that later
[1:23:33] <gigacanuck> very poor safety protocols around here
[1:23:33] <stolando_florida> Mods change your weapon's aesthetic
[1:23:34] <+Nomicro4u> y\

[1:23:46] <+oleron_666> cause of the mod
[1:23:48] <Jodoxk1> mods change appearnce of the weapon
[1:23:49] <%worldbrand> That's neat
[1:23:56] <%GarbageNirvana> I wish more games did that
[1:24:00] <sjcodan> KEY

[1:24:12] <Mister_McDerp> activate the stargate
[1:24:12] <mor3gan> when does it become fun
[1:24:18] <+jorgamund> launch the nukes
[1:24:21] <sjcodan> @mor3gan Like, 4 hours in
[1:24:23] <MrGreenToS> mods change looks of weapons
[1:24:24] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean it sounds like Pat's been having fun so far
[1:24:32] <transporterthesequel> OH WHAT
[1:24:43] <transporterthesequel> What is this big 60's magic?!!
[1:24:47] <energywarning> i'm so invested in all this important lore
[1:24:50] <+Nomicro4u> Is this game any good solo?
[1:24:51] <star_feline> That's a clean ass computer considering it's from the 1960s
[1:24:51] <$valriot> Literally The Marker
[1:24:52] <flatty1000> oh no capitalised monster terms
[1:24:55] <sjcodan> PAT: Area
[1:25:01] <sjcodan> s's are randomly generated
[1:25:03] <gigacanuck> *STARGATE THEME GETS LOUDER*
[1:25:06] <transporterthesequel> Turn on the doom portal
[1:25:06] <flatty1000> scientists agree to call this mysterious force....the Root
[1:25:11] <+jorgamund> "in case of catastrophic failure and imminent death, please see me in my office. Don't hesitate to knock!"
[1:25:13] <$valriot> TOTALLY NOT EVIL AT ALL
[1:25:16] <sjcodan> You might not even find the same bosses
[1:25:17] <%brave_sj> Super not evil
[1:25:17] <+GenesisKnight> That's a big evil magic
[1:25:18] <%starotter70> Naaaaah
[1:25:19] <+Cardz_> Oh thats a baseball
[1:25:20] <DetroitSentai> @Nomicro4u I've been doing pretty fine solo, pretty viable no matter what
[1:25:21] <+Nomicro4u> LETS TOUCH IT
[1:25:24] <%worldbrand> Something smells like resonance cascade
[1:25:26] <%GarbageNirvana> There's that Joe Mad magic
[1:25:32] <$valriot> FRIENDLY ARTIFACT
[1:25:32] <KaliasTV> Weird, this hell magic crystal attracts the evil somehow
[1:25:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> She sliding
[1:25:33] <flatty1000> smells like the marker
[1:25:34] <%dalmek> I like this industrial magic bs
[1:25:34] <%Razputin217> BONFIRE LIT
[1:25:34] <+Sindellah> Is Pat gonna go through the whole game or is this a one shot?
[1:25:37] <+Nomicro4u> I was thinking of buying it, but classic comes out in 2 days :(
[1:25:41] <spinalwizard> I wonder how radioactive that thing is
[1:25:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Jamie Lee Curtis
[1:25:51] <transporterthesequel> I think VERY
[1:25:55] <TwitchingFrog> This voice acting seems off
[1:25:57] <+Nomicro4u> I always see people playing multiplayer, but thats generally not how I like to play souls games
[1:26:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dude, I love magic meets apocalyptic tech. This is such a good setting.
[1:26:05] <+Cardz_> Red glowing stuff is always safe
[1:26:10] <captainnathaniel> I feel like we are just inside the darksiders world and War is just walking somewhere close to here
[1:26:15] <transporterthesequel> One day he BECAME A BOSS I NEED TO KILL
[1:26:20] <SilverFaustX> game audio is low
[1:26:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TwitchingFrog it's off because she takes such long pauses for dramatic effect.
[1:26:25] <thebiganxiety> So whats the story of the monster bullshit?
[1:26:28] <spinalwizard> right. it's the glowing blue that kills ya
[1:26:28] <Mister_McDerp> lick the red glowing crystal
[1:26:29] <sjcodan> SEARCH THAT ROOM BIG
[1:26:31] <transporterthesequel> Gascoigne 2.0
[1:26:37] <%nmaten> ayytoll
[1:26:38] <energywarning> did he leave an armor set? perhaps with some skills on it?
[1:26:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Game audio seems fine to me but I've got headphones on
[1:26:39] <RantingRavager> It's pronounced Atoll
[1:26:43] <$valriot> Gasqwang
[1:26:46] <%Jp3g95> Gascwang
[1:26:47] <justaguy3> Put it on verry hard pat. that dificulty is fun!
[1:26:49] <Mister_McDerp> AYY LMAOTOLL
[1:26:50] <rytisone> This is one of the infinity stones...
[1:26:52] <TwitchingFrog> @CappuccinoGuil I think you mean ATTEMPTED dramatic effect, it doesn't land well
[1:26:52] <+Nomicro4u> TABERNAC
[1:26:53] <transporterthesequel> YES THAT walk off was great
[1:26:58] <flatty1000> I think you find its pronounced Ate-All
[1:26:58] <transporterthesequel> Max jank
[1:26:59] <%Jp3g95> Gassionee
[1:27:00] <%dalmek> "oh yeah thanks but you're banned from Firelink"
[1:27:00] <RantingRavager> Gasquank
[1:27:06] <%dalmek> would be a very ballsy alternative
[1:27:12] <+Aiki_Man> !uptime
[1:27:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 27m.
[1:27:14] <$valriot> Teabag the W O O D
[1:27:20] <Mister_McDerp> sit at bonfire
[1:27:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Bonfire'd
[1:27:23] <+Nomicro4u> Bonfire activate
[1:27:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> Why the in game animation look better than the cut scenes
[1:27:26] <%Keeble24> is this big bonfires
[1:27:29] <transporterthesequel> WHAT
[1:27:30] <+GenesisKnight> Reroll?
[1:27:31] <sjcodan> AREAS ARE RANDOMIZED
[1:27:31] <%Calek> that's to make it harder
[1:27:32] <Doomed2Die> @AngriestPat you have to reroll to change difficulty if you want
[1:27:35] <%starotter70> Excuse me?
[1:27:35] <star_feline> Guy seems awfully eager to touch the big evil crystal
[1:27:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can also sprint crouch when you need to slide into cover
[1:27:36] <SpaceGuntank> its a rougelike
[1:27:37] <justaguy3> rellor it to change dificulkty pat
[1:27:37] <%Keeble24> BIG BONFIRE TIME
[1:27:38] <%Jp3g95> RANDOMIZED
[1:27:38] <ittla> this game is so weird. whens a boss fight
[1:27:40] <stolando_florida> Rerolling is an end-game thing after you beat the game because the game is randomized.
[1:27:40] <KaliasTV> Earth
[1:27:41] <%dalmek> wait, EARTH?
[1:27:41] <+GenesisKnight> Earth?! What
[1:27:42] <Cendov> Rerolling is for enga e and farming stuff
[1:27:45] <+Xenomorphfiend> rerolls your world layout. start at beginning
[1:27:45] <+Rezca> Loot and Bosses are randomized
[1:27:46] <sjcodan> REROLL TO GET DIFFERENT BOSSES/LOOT
[1:27:48] <%Evan2Echoes> the world is somewhat procedurally generated
[1:27:49] <%SergeantSov> Areas a big random. Procedurally generated
[1:27:49] <%Jp3g95> Wait what
[1:27:52] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat did you know the 4th floor is out for hades?
[1:27:53] <gigacanuck> endgame stuff
[1:27:54] <DetroitSentai> Your campign zones are randomized, different bosses and loot
[1:27:54] <+king_of_beggars> Tha's a wicked ass looking aethryte.
[1:27:54] <%Evan2Echoes> you'll find different areas and different loot
[1:27:56] <+AllenDeadman> DO NOT REROLL
[1:27:57] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> its semi proceduraly generated
[1:27:58] <sjcodan> BIG PROCEDURAL GENERATE
[1:28:00] <%decisivelynameless> it remakes the maps
[1:28:00] <manoshake> reroll changes the world and bosses

[1:28:06] <+Zxtole> I love when games create random names for already established terms
[1:28:06] <@SSaryn> If you go to the stone and look at it, you can Reroll the Campaign from Normal, Hard and something else, don't worry about that right now though.

[1:28:30] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat at anytime you can replace the ENTIRE campaign with a newly generated one, but it sets enemy level to your current gear level (and you can pick difficulty atop that)

[1:34:45] <sjcodan> @GeneralSCPatton He did
[1:35:04] <%bevyrage> is there an option to turn the mini-map off?
[1:35:09] <%GarbageNirvana> I think it's mapped cause of the procedural generation thing, if you didn't have it you'd probably end up getting lost
[1:35:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sjcodan The other one. It says something about him burning all his notes
[1:35:14] <rytisone> The Division Souls
[1:35:17] <borous> just relax chat let him explore
[1:35:18] <VJdarkworld> ashes one.... seek souls
[1:35:19] <sjcodan> @bevyrage No, you kinda need it
[1:35:24] <%bevyrage> wait it's procedural? shit
[1:35:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wait Pat can you try and do an advanced Wallbounce shot gun shot combo for me. I'm sure you're very up to date with your high tier GEars 2 combat

[1:35:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> I need to know, but I don't wanna waste the dough

[1:36:09] <VJdarkworld> use the Fume UGS :)
[1:36:14] <+Xenomorphfiend> @hepabuttlicker its dps just destroys any enemies at close to mid range. Have a sniper secondary and you're golden. Plus it recharges mods real fast

[1:39:14] <ittla> pat are you enjoying this?
[1:39:15] <%galaxyswirl> is this only on pc or what?

[1:39:35] <+Xenomorphfiend> its a really pretty game too
[1:39:36] <RantingRavager> Gunsouls
[1:39:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> All breakables are wood

[1:39:45] <mor3gan> It looks like it belongs in last gen
[1:39:47] <+Rezca> yeah... between this and Surge. I'd go this
[1:39:47] <ittla> i think the surge is kinda awful
[1:39:49] <transporterthesequel> The who now?
[1:39:49] <energywarning> i try not to remember
[1:39:50] <+kuervojones> Surge is a good game
[1:39:50] <Skeletonmanners> Sergei
[1:39:51] <DetroitSentai> hunter has good mobility
[1:39:51] <sjcodan> It gets MUCH better in the further areas
[1:39:51] <gustavozxd> I don't want to remember
[1:39:51] <%SergeantSov> Surge was Dark Souls but sci-fi and half-baked
[1:39:53] <AnacondaVirtue> I wish I DIDN'T remember The Surge
[1:39:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> I won't be impressed till I see a wall slide into wall bounce into 360
[1:39:54] <+AllenDeadman> pat playing in normal?
[1:39:55] <+TheDankDemon> it's good tbh
[1:39:55] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat is this a soulslike?
[1:39:55] <%GarbageNirvana> That was a PS+ free game at one point
[1:39:57] <%BubbaRands> Hoontah
[1:39:57] <%aishman> There are certain items that drop randomly which gives you like say, a magunm
[1:39:59] <+Chaossheep> Hunter and Cultist probably pretty similar
[1:40:00] <$Garthunox> the drink?
[1:40:00] <+Xenomorphfiend> @Nanocomputer doesnt really matter cause you can just get the armor you want
[1:40:03] <xeros720> i beat the Surge earlier this year, was okay
[1:40:04] <%aishman> Also each starting class gives you a unique third trait
[1:40:05] <thegreenbenis> @CommanderSqueaks I know about the joke I thought you were actually asking that.
[1:40:06] <%Jp3g95> I liked the Surge but I wish there was more of an idea of which way to fucking go in that game
[1:40:06] <transporterthesequel> Can any class use any gun?
[1:40:07] <sjcodan> Armor wheight does nothing but effect roll
[1:40:08] <%bevyrage> pat go back to the hall you missed a thing in the corner
[1:40:10] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat Surge 2's coming out i think
[1:40:10] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> if you turn on advanced stats you can see your equip load
[1:40:10] <+allups> surged the only game where u can play someone in a wheelchair for abouyt 5 secs
[1:40:11] <stolando_florida> Yes, Transporter
[1:40:11] <%arcaderabbit48> Fun Fact: The Surge is getting a sequel this year
[1:40:13] <sjcodan> Its SUPER SOULS
[1:40:16] <aeonicvector> Souls-esque
[1:40:17] <DetroitSentai> Yeah it's souls
[1:40:19] <+Uulyaoth> all mobikity is the same
[1:40:20] <%ssjklyco> It's Fallout Souls
[1:40:21] <Mister_McDerp> yep
[1:40:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @thegreenbenis No prob bob
[1:40:21] <+Lost_Zombie> Personally like Cultist the best for the starting trait
[1:40:23] <%DedlokPM> @thegreenbenis The "Who's talking" thing is a stream running joke thing.
[1:40:23] <sjcodan> Its 100% souls
[1:40:24] <+Trair> Its a survival horror souls like
[1:40:24] <ittla> the thing that bugs the hell out of me with the surge is that your augments are surgically implanted on top of your clothes
[1:40:25] <flatty1000> so so far we've seen 3 types of enemy
[1:40:27] <rytisone> now use Estus
[1:40:27] <ittla> it's so dumb
[1:40:27] <DetroitSentai> Need a better genre term honestly
[1:40:28] <%SergeantSov> By the way you can reload and roll
[1:40:29] <%BubbaRands> GunSouls
[1:40:31] <blackbookalpha> Red Dead By Daylight?
[1:40:33] <star_feline> Is Surge that punchy souls game that I gave up on because it looked too complex?
[1:40:36] <%Jp3g95> Wow that firing rate
[1:40:36] <Iwashi94> it's like if Resi4 was souls
[1:40:37] <sjcodan> SOULVIAL HORROR
[1:40:37] <+Chaossheep> transporterthesequel there are no classes in that sense, it just determines your starting equipment and you can buy all the stuff you didn't pick. Everyone has access to everything, yeah.
[1:40:38] <%poker4121> it has souls-like on the steam page
[1:40:38] <+Zxtole> Soulsborne is a great term
[1:40:38] <%Nanocomputer> @Xenomorphfiend I just heard the scrap guy had slow rolls so I thought mobility was tied to class.
[1:40:44] <Tatrix912> Is there a weight system? carry item and armor weight for fat rolling
[1:40:45] <+SuperSilverPanda> How is the game?
[1:40:45] <%ArcanumMBD> Is this just Bloodborne but with guns?
[1:40:49] <+Xenomorphfiend> @Nanocomputer just armor
[1:40:51] <cosmicdischarge> the game sold really well and the devs said next upcoming dlc is free @AngriestPat
[1:40:52] <transporterthesequel> Thanks @Chaossheep !
[1:40:54] <+Zxtole> Bloodborne has guns LUL
[1:40:57] <VJdarkworld> "a third person shooter where devs love dark souls" is the specific genre :)
[1:41:00] <thegreenbenis> @DedlokPM I know that, I thought he was actually asking who was talking in the game. I was their when Paige told the story.
[1:41:00] <Mister_McDerp> bloodborne has guns?
[1:41:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> can you slide into cover?
[1:41:02] <%ArcanumMBD> Thats the joke @Zxtole
[1:41:05] <%SergeantSov> I use it to reload my coachgun safer all the time
[1:41:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Bloodborne has "guns"
[1:41:06] <$valriot> Gungeon strats
[1:41:10] <+primax104> souls had almost become one of the default 3rd person camera genre
[1:41:10] <thegreenbenis> I mean here in chat.*
[1:41:10] <sjcodan> @Zxtole No, Bloodborn had a parry boom
[1:41:11] <%DedlokPM> @Tatrix912 there is an armor weight thing yeah
[1:41:12] <blackbookalpha> Dark Souls with swords
[1:41:12] <Mister_McDerp> LUL
[1:41:15] <Ropcord> it also has some procedural stuff so maps are all different between playthroughs
[1:41:15] <Tomschiii> the bosses are pretty stupid tbh
[1:41:19] <flatty1000> no bloodborne had an interesting aesthetic to it whereas this is kind of generically urban fantasy
[1:41:19] <%Jp3g95> Is this just the Surge with guns?
[1:41:23] <DetroitSentai> Bosses are ez
[1:41:23] <xeros720> Bloodborne had long range parry machines
[1:41:24] <%bevyrage> bloodborne isn't a good comparison because the pacing of combat is more intense than this
[1:41:24] <koffeemancer> You dont lose "souls" on death so it's not super soulslike
[1:41:30] <+Zxtole> @sjcodan Tell that to my Cannon
[1:41:32] <JMSkiiboskii> is this only pc?
[1:41:34] <%arcaderabbit48> Bloodborne has peashooters, and cannons with very little inbetween
[1:41:37] <sjcodan> ITS PROCEDURAL
[1:41:37] <BungalowBanshee> It's wild that this came from the Darksiders team
[1:41:40] <+Chaossheep> Yeah it does, it's like diablo 2 in that sense
[1:41:40] <DetroitSentai> Yep
[1:41:43] <%decisivelynameless> It's mostly on bosses and dungeon spawns
[1:41:46] <%Who_lio42> RNG? better ban it for smash
[1:41:46] <sjcodan> YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN GET THE GEAR YOU WANT
[1:41:46] <+Xenomorphfiend> darksiders 3 team
[1:41:48] <aeonicvector> Yeah, this is randomly generated like a warframe map
[1:41:48] <%PaladinDupre> Oh god, procedural souls
[1:41:48] <RupanSen> that's very un-soulslike
[1:41:49] <MajorMaryJane> yeah alot of the areas look the same
[1:41:49] <rytisone> Chunk Souls
[1:41:52] <%SergeantSov> You've already got a better world-seed than I did
[1:41:53] <Cendov> Bosses are randomly picked from a pool as well
[1:41:55] <Skeletonmanners> darksiders 2 and 3 guys
[1:41:55] <%GarbageNirvana> This is on consoles too
[1:41:58] <sjcodan> GEAR AND GUNS ARE RANDOM
[1:41:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> I explain that in a donation. Don't worry about it.
[1:41:59] <VJdarkworld> chalice souls
[1:41:59] <flatty1000> so does that just mean you'll be seeing the same buildings and maps a lot?
[1:41:59] <$sylphyyyy> So it's like Dark Cloud
[1:42:00] <+primax104> procedural
[1:42:03] <star_feline> Dark Souls but with roguelike
[1:42:05] <LucaSteal> Hey, this game any good? Looks good.
[1:42:07] <Gamester091> @AngriestPat each players save is seeded so everyone one is different
[1:42:10] <$valriot> LUL LUL
[1:42:10] <Mister_McDerp> loot box
[1:42:13] <%SwdVengeance> Warframe with Tiles
[1:42:13] <%bevyrage> that loot drop was hella diablo 2 geez
[1:42:13] <Ropcord> it's pretty great
[1:42:14] <%arcaderabbit48> Loot Sploosh
[1:42:16] <thebiganxiety> Wait are the levels procedurally generated?
[1:42:16] <GundamF91> The overall aesthetic of this is mad boring honestly
[1:42:17] <+AllenDeadman> you need multiple playthroughs to get all equipment
[1:42:19] <DetroitSentai> Chalice dungeon the game sorta
[1:42:19] <HorribleHog> Very diablo with loot too it seems
[1:42:21] <%bevyrage> just slap that shit on the ground like PAH
[1:42:22] <%Calek> sometimes enemies come out of nowhere and they don't stop
[1:42:23] <%DedlokPM> @sjcodan mini-bosses are random too
[1:42:24] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat lay out, bosses, events, and a few dungeons are random
[1:42:25] <%Bane_Kaikyo> P E E S T O L E
[1:42:25] <Pequod1> Also kinda looks like a resident evil
[1:42:29] <$valriot> Fortnite box
[1:42:30] <xeros720> i can see why people are into this though, this is pretty much what i wanted from borderlands
[1:42:33] <tigerfang86> D R O O G S
[1:42:34] <%GarbageNirvana> It's hard to do post-apoc not-boring imo
[1:42:34] <stolando_florida> @GundamF91 that's only the starter area. There's multiple areas in this game
[1:42:35] <flatty1000> NO PAT ITS A CONSUMABLE
[1:42:37] <mor3gan> this is not a game i see myself playing
[1:42:37] <captainnathaniel> im just waiting for vulgrim to turn up and reveal we are on the darksiders universe
[1:42:39] <%arcaderabbit48> F R E N Z Y
[1:42:45] <%PaladinDupre> @GundamF91 third person wasteland 2 without the world building
[1:42:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> BUT ITS a consumable
[1:42:48] <sjcodan> !!! FRENZY !!!
[1:42:49] <+Xenomorphfiend> @thebiganxiety kinda yea. Some things are set in stone, but the map layouts are different for each zone
[1:42:50] <$valriot> PIZZA PogChamp
[1:42:50] <MrGreenToS> you have to beat game several times to fully see everything
[1:42:53] <xeros720> if this gets to ps4, i'll probably play it
[1:42:54] <+Rezca> wish the effects lasted longer, 30s feels too short
[1:42:54] <Pequod1> Looks kinda barren though, pretty boring
[1:42:55] <+ultimafullmetal> I heard someone call it Gears of Souls Diablo Edition.
[1:43:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hoard it like dragon
[1:43:05] <%Jp3g95> GEARS OF SOULs holy shit
[1:43:08] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat it seems when you move your accuracy decreses
[1:43:09] <Thesomeone96> it is on ps4
[1:43:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Soul of Gears
[1:43:16] <DetroitSentai> I really dont like the diablo comparisons
[1:43:17] <Tatrix912> @DedlokPM Thanks! was curious about that
[1:43:17] <star_feline> Honestly always a fan of urban overgrowth enviroments
[1:43:18] <Pequod1> Nice dodhe
[1:43:19] <TheVampiricVamp> BIG DODGE
[1:43:20] <Fabric_tester> 3rd person shooter darksiders
[1:43:22] <VJdarkworld> magnetism magic :O
[1:43:23] <Mister_McDerp> souls of war
[1:43:24] <+AllenDeadman> you can crit the weakspots too
[1:43:24] <%Jp3g95> Soul of the Blood of the Gear
[1:43:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> It can't be called Gears of Souls untill I see a wall bounce
[1:43:28] <+Xenomorphfiend> there is weapon sway
[1:43:29] <DetroitSentai> I just never got that feeling with my time in it
[1:43:32] <%PaladinDupre> The level design of Darksiders 3 meets the aesthetic of Last of Us
[1:43:35] <%WackyGear> so what is the setting of this game
[1:43:35] <MrGreenToS> its barren because its just the first world
[1:43:35] <flatty1000> yeah Gears of War feels like the closest thing but with some loot mechanics and light rpg stuff thrown in
[1:43:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @star_feline So the Last of Us aesthetic?
[1:43:41] <%arcaderabbit48> So the enemies definitely seem plant related
[1:43:50] <Tomschiii> anyone seen the trailer of the kickstarte game Bleak Faith: forsaken?
[1:43:51] <sjcodan> YOU THINK?
[1:43:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Well they are called the Root
[1:43:54] <%Jp3g95> Its Bark Souls
[1:43:55] <VJdarkworld> its over :O
[1:43:56] <nukle0nik> those enemies all do the same spin when they go down lol
[1:43:56] <%bevyrage> they're named 'the root' after all
[1:43:57] <TheVampiricVamp> Woah, It's over
[1:43:59] <+primax104> so is this using assets from darksiders 3?
[1:43:59] <+Rezca> prepare to hate it 3 hours in
[1:44:00] <%bevyrage> heh, bark souls
[1:44:04] <%bevyrage> BARK BUSTERS
[1:44:06] <Pequod1> Is it over again?
[1:44:06] <flatty1000> less last of us more "legendary" lol
[1:44:08] <star_feline> @CommanderSqueaks Pretty much, but for some reason I didn't dig the Last of Us
[1:44:09] <%SergeantSov> He'll say "Its over" whenever you don't attack anything for a certain amount of time
[1:44:11] <Timurine> Looks like a forgettable game
[1:44:11] <tigerfang86> BORK BUSTED
[1:44:14] <%dalmek> Dark Soils
[1:44:14] <rytisone> A telephone booth. Call Nico
[1:44:14] <JayEarly> @tomschiii yes, I got a new favorite band now
[1:44:15] <%Jp3g95> BEVY YES
[1:44:18] <Ropcord> it's what vergil did in dmc5 but everywhere
[1:44:19] <HorribleHog> it's got some cool aesthetics, I'm not a fan of the diablo looting or the weapons
[1:44:19] <gigacanuck> aw, disappointing
[1:44:20] <%WackyGear> is Ygdrasil the villain?
[1:44:23] <%PaladinDupre> BulletBorne
[1:44:24] <StromkoPenguin> I don't want to ruin it for Pat but this whole aesthetic we're seeing here is only a small part of the game.
[1:44:26] <%decisivelynameless> Lol wait until you get a bit further in the game. The aesthetic gets much cooler.
[1:44:30] <gigacanuck> Bark Souls should be Dark Souls but it's all dogs
[1:44:33] <xeros720> sweet, i'll have to pick this up once i finish Shadowbringers
[1:44:39] <stolando_florida> The last area in the game is so pretty I love it
[1:44:42] <+Rezca> true game begins at world 2
[1:44:42] <%bevyrage> nah that'd be 'Bork Souls'
[1:44:44] <Doomed2Die> the first "act" is the worst part of this game tbh
[1:44:46] <%PaladinDupre> @gigacanuck thats Bork Souls
[1:44:47] <artoflec> also this game isn't full price which is nice
[1:44:48] <%Jp3g95> Giga that's strong furry bait ya got there
[1:44:50] <+Pookiedaexzile> Question to chat, how many of the enemy types have we already seen, like most of them or just an intro
[1:44:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> or like half
[1:44:55] <%arcaderabbit48> @gigacanuck Yeah, I'd play that
[1:44:59] <DetroitSentai> just an intro
[1:45:01] <aeonicvector> @Pookiedaexzile intro
[1:45:02] <+Xenomorphfiend> @Pookiedaexzile 1/4
[1:45:03] <Doomed2Die> there is alot of enemy types
[1:45:03] <flatty1000> good job that torch didn't burn out in this ABANDONED CITY
[1:45:03] <Pequod1> item
[1:45:06] <JayEarly> how is this game
[1:45:08] <Doomed2Die> more than most games
[1:45:11] <aeonicvector> games great
[1:45:16] <%bevyrage> that torch is doing its best
[1:45:17] <Tomschiii> @JayEarly THAT and hopefully a great game that actually is as good as the trailer material^^
[1:45:20] <stolando_florida> The root are obviously lighting the torches cos it gets spooky at night
[1:45:20] <aero160h> When you go back to ward 13 go to the lower levels and finish exploring it.
[1:45:23] <Gartender> Is it still great without friends
[1:45:32] <%PaladinDupre> BIG IRON
[1:45:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> Thank you
[1:45:32] <+griffball13> BIG IRON
[1:45:34] <TheVampiricVamp> BIG IRON
[1:45:35] <aeonicvector> titanite get
[1:45:35] <%bevyrage> big item: BIG IRON
[1:45:35] <%Jp3g95> apatBig Iron
[1:45:36] <Ropcord> i've been playing it solo and it's still pretty fun
[1:45:37] <gigacanuck> audio cues messing me up here
[1:45:37] <+Cardz_> BIG IRON
[1:45:38] <+Rezca> iRon
[1:45:41] <thegreenbenis> BIG IRON
[1:45:43] <%DeepFryedLogic> iron so far away
[1:45:43] <Mister_McDerp> IRON
[1:45:46] <%arcaderabbit48> Well, we know at least one other person has been in this area so having some torches isn't entirely out of the question
[1:45:46] <xeros720> i heard that the game balance is a bit better solo since the bosses spawn less adds
[1:45:46] <%PaladinDupre> FASTEST DRAW
[1:45:46] <gigacanuck> SMASH
[1:45:46] <captainnathaniel> @Pookiedaexzile this game has 100 plus types of enemies mobs
[1:45:51] <Fabric_tester> Iran
[1:46:06] <deviljhojho94> The true apocalypse was the toxic friendhips we made along the way
[1:46:08] <JayEarly> @tomschiii Heilung is the most metal band that isn’t metal
[1:46:09] <AnacondaVirtue> The game feels pretty good
[1:46:10] <RagingLeo> So like Bloodborne?
[1:46:10] <+griffball13> pat is basicly texus red
[1:46:13] <Arth__> Default_Pistol_Sound_1.mp3
[1:46:13] <stolando_florida> Stagger with boolet, smash with melee
[1:46:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> I agree though, this game is lacking the 'pressure' of a Souls. Souls wasn't full of distinct, DMClike arenas, enemies just existed in the world. I feel like each of these battles should end with a style ranking.
[1:46:22] <%PaladinDupre> @griffball13 had not stopped typing when a post was fairly sent
[1:46:22] <star_feline> Texas Plague
[1:46:25] <xeros720> oh you know what, this actually reminds me of the first Tomb Raider reboot, funny enough
[1:46:36] <manoshake> you can destroy the shelfs for scraps
[1:46:42] <Gartender> Better on mouse/keyboard or controller
[1:46:42] <%BestTeaMaker> so that's Outer Wilds, The Sinking City, Plague Tale, and now Remnant From the Ashes that I'll add to my wishlist
[1:46:46] <FirearmsInstructor> This isn't the Final Fantasy! D:
[1:46:48] <Fabric_tester> Tomb of the bark souls?
[1:46:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Well you can up the difficulty from the sounds of it if you're really looking for that brutal Souls-like experience
[1:46:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Hopefully that doesn't just make the health bars bigger
[1:46:57] <TheVampiricVamp> Everybody let's stay down
[1:47:03] <deviljhojho94> just like john wayne woulda done
[1:47:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> I feel like some music would really really help.
[1:47:04] <+king_of_beggars> Can you imagine Paige trying to play THIS Souls-like?
[1:47:04] <Tomschiii> @JayEarly dont expect less of a band that is named "heilung" and their origin^^
[1:47:06] <%Calek> This game is pretty difficult on the standard difficulty at times
[1:47:18] <%PaladinDupre> Someone needs to do an LP of this as The Lorax
[1:47:21] <transporterthesequel> That is some generous iframes
[1:47:28] <star_feline> This game so far needs more ammo scarcity
[1:47:33] <+primax104> is that a style ranking line?
[1:47:38] <Ropcord> the enemies in this area are much easier to deal with than the ones you get later
[1:47:44] <%bevyrage> ammo scarcity seems to be adjusted with higher difficulty
[1:47:44] <%BestTeaMaker> does this have gun katas
[1:47:48] <stolando_florida> @star_feline you can bump up the difficulty
[1:47:49] <DetroitSentai> Scarcity gets up there at times @star_feline
[1:47:51] <justaguy3> in hardmode pat this game can be ruthles
[1:47:52] <%Jp3g95> I'm def picking this game up at some point in the future
[1:47:55] <%WackyGear> so much iron
[1:47:57] <+AllenDeadman> no gun katas
[1:47:59] <Doomed2Die> the first difficulty jump is prob the first dungeon, but i was playing on hard
[1:48:00] <Cendov> Dungeon time!
[1:48:00] <transporterthesequel> Yes magic portal should be fine
[1:48:01] <DetroitSentai> dungeon
[1:48:01] <gigacanuck> it's a trap
[1:48:04] <gigacanuck> calling it now
[1:48:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> A gears with a style ranking would be lit, Like Vanquished but better
[1:48:06] <star_feline> Ah no wonder people wanted to Pat to increase difficulty
[1:48:08] <%SergeantSov> Time for big Dungeon Crawl
[1:48:08] <xeros720> i'm personally hoping one of the classes can perfect dodge into a melee counter
[1:48:08] <JayEarly> those are some nice duster physics
[1:48:10] <transporterthesequel> All magic portals are friendly!
[1:48:11] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat enjoy the easy first enemies. this is the kind of game that makes you rage
[1:48:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @star_feline That's it, I don't nearly feel the same stakes as in a Soulslike, no actual threat.
[1:48:12] <TwitchingFrog> So... What is this game? I saw it on Steam a few days ago and that was my first time seeing or hearing about it.
[1:48:12] <Brainworm205> Oooh I love this game. Just about it beaten it. Some sweet boss fights. Some bad ones too.
[1:48:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Shiny sewer
[1:48:14] <%arcaderabbit48> I think the ammo is fine. The draw fo the game is actually being able to use your guns against these arboreal horrors. I'd rather the guns have too much ammo, than too little
[1:48:17] <+primax104> sewer level?
[1:48:25] <rytisone> go hunt ninja turtles
[1:48:27] <TheVampiricVamp> Bonefire
[1:48:28] <+primax104> SEWER LEVEL!
[1:48:30] <FirearmsInstructor> Did Pat play FFVII earlier, or is he going to play later? This game looks interesting.

[1:54:16] <star_feline> DansGame Kitchen pooper
[1:54:17] <+Technores> (vr game)
[1:54:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat why do you poop in the kitchen?
[1:54:19] <FirearmsInstructor> Hi Chat. I just got here 10 minutes ago. Can someone tell me the schedule? Did he start at 3, and has he played FFVII? (That's what it says on the schedule.) Thanks. :)
[1:54:20] <+AllenDeadman> pretty sure it ain't the darksiders universe seeing as how there is no demons running around
[1:54:21] <%skizzuto> of course pat would poop in the kitchen, the bathroom is a disgusting place, after all
[1:54:23] <TwitchingFrog> When I first saw this game, I thought it was maybe meant to be a 19th century post-apocalypse, but they've mentioned microwaves.
[1:54:24] <Fabric_tester> Why do you poop in the kitchen?
[1:54:26] <+kuervojones> Repeater pistol or SMG?
[1:54:27] <%terribleusername> he uses the sink of course
[1:54:28] <justaguy3> lee is the one who sells consumbales
[1:54:28] <+Valentttine> upgrade the thing, number go up

[1:54:49] <star_feline> Mom found the poop kitchen
[1:54:50] <+griffball13> is he a melee player?
[1:54:50] <Pequod1> Ey Reggie
[1:54:52] <flatty1000> it skirts over the complicated notion of sourcing the ingredients for bullets
[1:54:55] <JayEarly> is that Lee?
[1:55:01] <RantingRavager> It's Lee
[1:55:02] <stolando_florida> @kuervojones pistol does more damage in less shots, smg is one of the weakest guns in the game but has more ammo.
[1:55:03] <justaguy3> @JayEarly ye

[1:56:27] <TwitchingFrog> Are the guns in this game meant to be original post-apocalyptic designs? That pistol is clearly just a Bergmann.

[1:57:18] <flatty1000> they went, like a lot of things, "hey that RE4 pistol is super popular, put something like that in there"
[1:57:20] <nukle0nik> why is money worth anything in this post apocalypse
[1:57:22] <gunzerkingdunce> @variousominousdrones its rough but enjoyable
[1:57:23] <+Cardz_> He called you a friend and you tell him to fuck off
[1:57:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @twitchingfrog Yup
[1:57:31] <star_feline> Wait so did the world end from nuclear BOMBS or nuclear DEMONS?
[1:57:32] <VariousOminousDrones> Worth grabbing it as a co-op experience?
[1:57:33] <stolando_florida> @VariousOminousDrones I've put about 48 hours into it, and enjoyed it. It's reviewed quite high, it's a little jank but really fun imo.
[1:57:35] <%GarbageNirvana> So far Pat's reaction has been "Hmm" but with an upward, curious inflection
[1:57:36] <captainnathaniel> @TwitchingFrog yes
[1:57:37] <gunzerkingdunce> @nukle0nik its scrap my dude
[1:57:38] <cbdg> that's a big security card
[1:57:43] <stolando_florida> @VariousOminousDrones if you're looking for a coop game this is a real good one
[1:57:44] <+TheSaintJohn> Lore Room
[1:57:49] <VariousOminousDrones> niceeeeee
[1:57:50] <%GarbageNirvana> It's piqued his interest if nothing else
[1:57:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> @star_feline You're about to get some clues on that
[1:57:53] <VariousOminousDrones> will check it out
[1:57:53] <nukle0nik> ah
[1:57:55] <gunzerkingdunce> This room is real cool
[1:57:57] <Mister_McDerp> he even opens doors like a souls character
[1:58:00] <+AllenDeadman> save them for now
[1:58:03] <+Rezca> Max trait level is 20
[1:58:05] <%bevyrage> bank it
[1:58:07] <Ropcord> P U M P
[1:58:07] <+Lost_Zombie> Save it
[1:58:08] <star_feline> @GeneralSCPatton Oh boy oh boy
[1:58:09] <+NobuuNobuu> Save
[1:58:09] <stolando_florida> Health is always good
[1:58:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Save it
[1:58:09] <BlindGato> Vigor
[1:58:11] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> pump
[1:58:11] <@SSaryn> Vigor is a good for now.
[1:58:13] <gigacanuck> PUMP
[1:58:14] <gunzerkingdunce> No, you'll get alot
[1:58:15] <aeonicvector> save or spirit @AngriestPat
[1:58:17] <Mister_McDerp> VIGOR
[1:58:17] <+TheNewZealandStory> save it until you need it
[1:58:18] <TwitchingFrog> Kinda weird that there's a Bergmann of all things but not a FAL or something more modern in the 1960s
[1:58:18] <+Vanic_Venator> What if you need the point later?
[1:58:18] <+TheSaintJohn> get BIG
[1:58:19] <%SergeantSov> Big Pump
[1:58:21] <+floralkami> all tech advancement ended in the 50's 60s, so no new guns
[1:58:23] <JayEarly> Isn’t the Red9 just a mauser?
[1:58:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat VIGOROUSLY PUMP
[1:58:23] <nukle0nik> 5mhz what a beast
[1:58:26] <TheVampiricVamp> Save the PUMP
[1:58:27] <%bevyrage> traits are consumables, therefore you must hoard them
[1:58:39] <FirearmsInstructor> I mean save it.
[1:58:40] <TwitchingFrog> @JayEarly The Red9 is a Mauser C96, yes
[1:58:42] <cosmicdischarge> do not use it for vigor you really dont need it @AngriestPat
[1:58:42] <%Calek> I beat the first area recently, should I reroll the campaign and do it again or just move on
[1:58:49] <star_feline> I'm still bothered how clean that computer loks
[1:58:57] <+smevvster> Do you customize your player character in this game?
[1:59:04] <gunzerkingdunce> @calek continue on unless an area crashes your game
[1:59:06] <gigacanuck> smash stuff Pat
[1:59:10] <%BestTeaMaker> it's a fallout computer
[1:59:12] <nukle0nik> the Red 9 in RE4 is a C96 mauser chambered for 9mm, named so because those guns in real life had a red 9 on the grip so you wouldn't accidentally load 7.65 ammo into them
[1:59:14] <+krozbones> @smevvster yeah a lil' bit
[1:59:21] <BlindGato> Basically Area51
[1:59:23] <rytisone> Character:"how do I download porn with this thing?"
[1:59:30] <FirearmsInstructor> @nukle0nik correct :)
[1:59:38] <JayEarly> I REALLY like those duster coat physics
[1:59:41] <@lewdskeletor13> PogChamp
[1:59:50] <+Pookiedaexzile> The dream....you say
[1:59:56] <star_feline> stfu it's MAGIC
[1:59:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> and these people are hunters of a sort
[1:59:56] <+floralkami> @star_feline it's an older computer. if it wasn't clean, it wouldn't work.
[1:59:59] <nukle0nik> it's really weird to see these retro computers but with widescreen displays
[2:00:06] <@lewdskeletor13> do the wizards teleport their shit away?
[2:00:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> So we could have a Dreamers hunt if you will
[2:00:22] <+griffball13> has science gone to far
[2:00:22] <stolando_florida> Oopsie woopsie we made a big fucky wucky
[2:00:27] <nukle0nik> @floralkami why would you think that, they'd still work even if they were dusty
[2:00:32] <%arcaderabbit48> They always do. Its getting boring
[2:00:35] <star_feline> @floralkami I get that but it LITERALLY looks out of the box
[2:00:35] <stolando_florida> FURRY WORLD
[2:00:36] <+floralkami> like, that computer is still running DOS
[2:00:38] <%ItsRatman> this isnt an old timey computer, not even clicky clacky noises
[2:00:39] <%Ranryu692> absolutely no clue what's going on since I missed the start, so I guess I'll just catch the VOD. Enjoy
[2:00:41] <gigacanuck> uuuugh
[2:00:47] <gigacanuck> UGH, LORE
[2:00:50] <JayEarly> @pookiedaexzile they even wear really long coats
[2:00:52] <MidnightBurst12> the UwU Realm
[2:01:01] <nukle0nik> the fuzzies lol
[2:01:01] <FirearmsInstructor> Fuzzies??
[2:01:01] <Mister_McDerp> fuzzies?
[2:01:09] <derap41> Like OG ultima fussies
[2:01:12] <%arcaderabbit48> Guardian Entity? Dreamers have a STAND
[2:01:14] <+floralkami> @star_feline yeah, they were finicky, like that. any dust in them and whole thing shorts out
[2:01:22] <%ItsRatman> Fuzzies OwO
[2:01:23] <Ropcord> second dream spoilers 😡
[2:01:26] <captainnathaniel> dreamer? is this turning cthulu stuff?
[2:01:33] <FirearmsInstructor> Emlo = Fuzzie
[2:01:38] <TwitchingFrog> There's a weird collection of tech on display here, we've got an old computer that hasn't leaked and fucked itself over, widescreen displays, and mostly late 19th to pre-WW2 weapons
[2:01:39] <nukle0nik> touch fuzzy get dizzy
[2:01:47] <thegreenbenis> OwO
[2:01:49] <star_feline> @floralkami Damn, I hope they got post-apocalyptic compressed air then LUL
[2:01:53] <stolando_florida> rip furries
[2:01:53] <+GenesisKnight> Motile?
[2:01:54] <VJdarkworld> furries evolved into fuzzies??? D:
[2:01:56] <StromkoPenguin> I would be very surprised if a computer like that existed prior to the mid 70's
[2:02:02] <%ItsRatman> Slaughter me daddy UwU
[2:02:10] <derap41> So this is how Lord British killed all the Fuzzies
[2:02:11] <%ThatOneGameTester> WutFace
[2:02:15] <%Cthulos> save them uwu
[2:02:16] <+Pookiedaexzile> "The fuzzies took up lodging on a New york Street, like a gang...but worse. They are learning english and teaching it to the children on....Seasame Street"
[2:02:17] <+floralkami> @stromkopenguin they did, in the military.
[2:02:19] <flatty1000> the fuzzywuzzies
[2:02:24] <nukle0nik> this appears to be some kinda microcomputer so it wouldn't have come into existence until 1978
[2:02:28] <tiojoe85> ResidentSleeper
[2:02:30] <%bevyrage> fuzzies
[2:02:30] <flatty1000> they don't like it uppem
[2:02:32] <%bevyrage> or FURRIES
[2:02:35] <gunzerkingdunce> Y'all time is fucked in this game. we started with a legit longsword and came in on a sail boat
[2:02:35] <+AllenDeadman> so we got other worlds
[2:02:36] <Dreigun> Save the furries, kill the trees?
[2:02:36] <FirearmsInstructor> Are the wooden bark creatures the fuzzies? D:
[2:02:38] <TwitchingFrog> @StromkoPenguin I suspect the devs didn't care much about picking a specific time period, they just had to pick a decade and then added anything they wanted regardless of period
[2:02:45] <+GenesisKnight> Insight gained?
[2:02:49] <gigacanuck> new trait?
[2:02:49] <KaliasTV> hell mixtape
[2:02:50] <+allups> this basement is basically the game
[2:02:51] <RantingRavager> INSIGHT GAINED
[2:02:52] <nukle0nik> smash that R2R tape
[2:02:52] <@lewdskeletor13> The Lore Dumping Grounds
[2:02:53] <exploitativity2> ooh SHIT
[2:02:54] <+AllenDeadman> elder knowledge? we gonna read lovecraftian shit
[2:02:54] <@SSaryn> ye
[2:02:54] <+floralkami> @nukle0nik commercially, but not for military use
[2:02:57] <%Cthulos> the fuzzies will cry out for me to save them. I will grumble under my breath, fine.
[2:02:57] <+Rezca> Insight gained
[2:03:02] <%arcaderabbit48> Ah, there's the Bloodborne. IT popped in early
[2:03:02] <star_feline> Those tree people doesn't seem so fuzzy to me
[2:03:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Elder Knowledge totally pays for itself
[2:03:16] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat Useful in this game cause perlevel xp caps out
[2:03:17] <nukle0nik> @floralkami most institutions like this would've used dumb terminals for a while yet
[2:03:19] <gunzerkingdunce> For puzzle
[2:03:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> So We got Bark bitches, Fuzzie Yiffers, and Now we need what....reptile boys
[2:03:20] <TwitchingFrog> @star_feline Maybe it's just Autumn/Fall?
[2:03:20] <derap41> ...yuou dfon't know what a fuse is?
[2:03:21] <rytisone> for fuse box
[2:03:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> AcidGirls
[2:03:27] <Ropcord> resident bloodborne
[2:03:28] <+Animefreak369> Elder Knowlage is great because there is no max level
[2:03:30] <JayEarly> what we need...is to get dizzy
[2:03:31] <+Snirtax> Aren't those kinda traits completely worthless ?
[2:03:34] <stolando_florida> reptile boys love making noise
[2:03:34] <derap41> @rytisone
[2:03:44] <star_feline> Play Mickey Mouse PogChamp
[2:03:45] <+TheNewZealandStory> does anything ever actually happen in this game
[2:03:50] <KaliasTV> A fuse is some sort of key, just like in real life :)
[2:03:50] <derap41> @rytisone Fusebox count +1
[2:03:52] <Ion_Laser> shhhh
[2:03:53] <+krozbones> I was super glad to see you cast a shadow in the projector. The game's not lazy
[2:03:54] <energywarning> she jsut knows
[2:03:58] <flatty1000> FUCK THESE LIMITED MEDICAL SUPPLIES
[2:04:01] <TwitchingFrog> @TheNewZealandStory I was kinda waiting for that too
[2:04:02] <gigacanuck> PAAAAAAAAAAIGE
[2:04:03] <pectusumbra> We GOTTA TELL PAIGE
[2:04:03] <alrobot2014> don't tell paige? I gotta tell paige!
[2:04:05] <@lewdskeletor13> Everyone go tell her
[2:04:06] <star_feline> @peachsaliva
[2:04:06] <+Pookiedaexzile> @peachsaliva Skeletons
[2:04:09] <xeros720> PAAAAAT
[2:04:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Go snitch
[2:04:12] <Ion_Laser> Her Skele-Sense is tingling!
[2:04:13] <%arcaderabbit48> We dont have to tell her. She can sense it
[2:04:14] <+floralkami> @nukle0nik well it's not supposed to be the 70's exactly, just that tech hasn't progessed muchpast that era
[2:04:15] <%MoonObscure> lol
[2:04:16] <CurrySauseBandit> @Snirtax In this game? Nope.
[2:04:18] <gunzerkingdunce> @angriestpat vault through glass windows
[2:04:19] <+Animefreak369> @Snirtax its great becasue there is no max level
[2:04:19] <MrGreenToS> that fuse can be used downstairs
[2:04:20] <%Laecerelius> I'm assuming that Paige has evolved a form of skeleton sense at this point
[2:04:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @snirtax Nope, xp per level caps out and stops scaling after a while. It will pay for itself
[2:04:21] <manoshake> you can vault on windows
[2:04:21] <JayEarly> yes Pat is just exploring the hub
[2:04:22] <@lewdskeletor13> Feed her addiction
[2:04:23] <+gatoralus> @TheNewZealandStory yeah this is just a lore and semi-secret area
[2:04:28] <StromkoPenguin> @Snirtax It depends how the game scales itself. If challenge is scaled to your character level, then yes, it'd be super useless.
[2:04:28] <%StEmlosWater> !uptime
[2:04:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 4m.
[2:04:46] <nukle0nik> "Harsgaard"
[2:04:51] <star_feline> " This isn't magic" Has literal RUNES
[2:04:58] <StromkoPenguin> Someone said this game scales itself to equipment level so character level shouldn't hurt if so.
[2:05:03] <+Snirtax> @GeneralSCPatton okay yeah fair enough that changes everything
[2:05:06] <nukle0nik> "dr itsaso", "is that so"?
[2:05:12] <%Cthulos> It's aliens you fucks
[2:05:29] <star_feline> Magical aliems
[2:05:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What are these items on your bottom left? Trying to understand as I got in way late. This game seems dark-souls / vampire / apocolapyse-esque. What is your characters goal / "motivation"? So far I only got fuzzies... .-.
[2:05:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> don't fuck aliens unless they really want it
[2:05:43] <+TheNewZealandStory> delivering lore in this manner is painfully dull
[2:05:53] <exploitativity2> eh, it's alright if you like reading
[2:05:55] <TwitchingFrog> Is this some "sufficiently advanced technology" magic shit?
[2:05:55] <+floralkami> @nukle0nik plus, the computers in a medical room.
[2:05:58] <VJdarkworld> error D:
[2:06:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Err-or
[2:06:06] <flatty1000> the wood dimension
[2:06:07] <star_feline> Wiki lore really sucks ngl
[2:06:08] <exploitativity2> okay THIS is interesting
[2:06:09] <manoshake> you can vault through windows pat
[2:06:11] <gigacanuck> this is literally a recipe for DOOM
[2:06:11] <%bevyrage> oh shit an akria
[2:06:12] <nukle0nik> it's the T-1000 arrived
[2:06:13] <flatty1000> oh a terminator
[2:06:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is this an ARG?
[2:06:14] <@SSaryn> Yeah. Shits fucked.
[2:06:14] <stolando_florida> A terminator definitely dropped there
[2:06:14] <+Sindellah> This is the best one
[2:06:16] <FirearmsInstructor> Terminator bubble!
[2:06:17] <TheVampiricVamp> Open up some butt?
[2:06:17] <+GenesisKnight> That's a thing.
[2:06:18] <CurrySauseBandit> Some bullshit that's what.
[2:06:20] <rytisone> Terminator
[2:06:20] <+GunToad> Terminator LUL
[2:06:20] <+griffball13> Vanilla Ice was there
[2:06:21] <RupanSen> Vanilla Ice?
[2:06:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Terminator came from the future
[2:06:22] <FirearmsInstructor> TIMEWARP
[2:06:23] <RantingRavager> This looks like 3.6 Rots. Not great, but not terrible
[2:06:24] <energywarning> the biggest ice cream scoop in the WORLD
[2:06:25] <+AllenDeadman> something got yeeted to another dimention
[2:06:26] <%heyitsbrian> Where an MRI melted into nothing?
[2:06:30] <Shwepie> Is this game what happens if Doom and Dark Souls have a baby?
[2:06:30] <gunzerkingdunce> They were REALLY fucking around with alternatives dimensions @angriestpat
[2:06:31] <Dapper_Cactuar> heyyo
[2:06:32] <+Shotgundam009> monkaS
[2:06:44] <+floralkami> THAT IS LITERALLY A TIME SCAR
[2:06:46] <%razielhex> Ah, Remnant, a game where you play as Erron Black in M. Night Shaymalayn's "The Happening."
[2:06:57] <nukle0nik> 55 fahrenheit i hope
[2:06:59] <+AllenDeadman> CLEMENTINE
[2:07:04] <derap41> Man these fucking devs
[2:07:05] <TwitchingFrog> Should probably say 55 degrees in what system, maybe that's where the fuck up occured
[2:07:05] <%Cthulos> okay, they knew
[2:07:06] <JayEarly> Everyone is doing a Terminator tie-in, it’s shameless
[2:07:15] <gigacanuck> @Shwepie impossible, DOOM and Dark Souls are thematic opposites
[2:07:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> CLEMENTINE AND LEE!
[2:07:19] <ShichiNoBushi> That's either hot or cold depending on the unit of temperature.
[2:07:20] <star_feline> Walking Dead universe confirmed
[2:07:21] <@lewdskeletor13> First Lee, now Clementine
[2:07:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Clems here?
[2:07:34] <+gatoralus> @AngriestPat I'm glad you are playing this, this is probably my second favorite game this year just behind RE2
[2:07:42] <rytisone> this game rips off everything
[2:07:48] <%arcaderabbit48> Clawbone?
[2:07:51] <gigacanuck> In Dark Souls you're trapped with the demons......in DOOM, the demons are trapped with you.
[2:07:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> I forgt RE2 came out this year
[2:07:53] <gunzerkingdunce> The lore here is the janitor turned up the temp and it made the dreamer freak
[2:07:54] <%razielhex> If you're going for a Western aesthetic, then "Lee" is usually a reference to Lee Van Cleef. And Clementine is... the song..
[2:08:01] <VJdarkworld> Unforeseen Consequences...........
[2:08:03] <nukle0nik> maybe if you're fucking with an entity named clawbone, maybe stop
[2:08:07] <star_feline> This place makes Black Mesa look like a 1st grader Science Fair
[2:08:11] <exploitativity2> interesting way to do [REDACTED]
[2:08:11] <+GenesisKnight> The Janitor fucked up didn't he
[2:08:12] <%Cthulos> this is some cthulhu shit
[2:08:13] <captainnathaniel> the world ended because the janitor couldn't keep his hands off the AC
[2:08:16] <+AllenDeadman> oh so that hole on the wall and floor was the janitors god damn fault
[2:08:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat They were sticking their dicks in an electrified hornet's nest. :|
[2:08:21] <+AllenDeadman> LUL
[2:08:22] <%Cthulos> these are the elder things
[2:08:23] <gunzerkingdunce> Basically these people had SCP stands
[2:08:24] <%razielhex> LOGGED IN: Q*Bert
[2:08:28] <%arcaderabbit48> This isn't just screwing with one alternate dimension, they were screwing with multiple different parallel dimensions. We're probably seeing the results of multiple apocalypses happening all at once
[2:08:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh boy
[2:08:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> Somebody got fucked
[2:08:37] <nukle0nik> notice how that desk appears to be solid
[2:08:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> DIMENSIONAL YOINK
[2:08:41] <gigacanuck> @gunzerkingdunce they had UAC standards
[2:08:43] <%Cthulos> they are trying to get to us the same way we are to them
[2:08:47] <+Sindellah> "Aw that sucks" cracks open a cold one
[2:08:47] <Mister_McDerp> scp bullshit
[2:08:53] <%bevyrage> no security no capture no protection
[2:08:54] <%Cthulos> who are they posessing?
[2:08:54] <FirearmsInstructor> SP Breach
[2:08:55] <%GarbageNirvana> "What a shame"
[2:08:55] <+AllenDeadman> jesus
[2:08:58] <+floralkami> F for Janitor
[2:08:58] <cbdg> so it has hot monster girls?
[2:08:58] <gigacanuck> uh oh
[2:08:58] <RantingRavager> SFP: Secure, Fuck around, Protect
[2:08:59] <%arcaderabbit48> Much, much less containment
[2:09:00] <star_feline> SCP Highschool Detention
[2:09:01] <VJdarkworld> SCP hangout
[2:09:01] <californaya> look at all this environmental storytelling
[2:09:02] <Ner234> And more End of the World Scenario
[2:09:05] <a_mad_dragon> this is the kind of thing the SCP would have to come clean up afterwards
[2:09:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> did I dream that there was a commercial from like Walmart or something about shitting your pants?
[2:09:07] <nukle0nik> goddamn there's a million computers in here
[2:09:09] <Dreigun> SCP: we're just winging it edition
[2:09:09] <%keyworthe> so the story of this game is basically, "you fucked up! "you fucked up!"
[2:09:10] <mr_slaide> Look at this Fallout bullshit.
[2:09:11] <%razielhex> Doki Doki SCP Containment Club
[2:09:15] <TheVampiricVamp> SCP without the P
[2:09:21] <SilverFaustX> tomuch readin
[2:09:22] <%arcaderabbit48> You fucked up x24
[2:09:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> I hate that I love this SCP bullshit
[2:09:24] <RantingRavager> EGO THE LIVING PLANET
[2:09:29] <Mister_McDerp> ew
[2:09:31] <%GarbageNirvana> We have dabbed
[2:09:33] <+Nomicro4u> MOIST OWO
[2:09:37] <%Cthulos> this is the whisperer in the dark
[2:09:38] <gigacanuck> who?
[2:09:39] <mr_slaide> Everything should be about Ego.
[2:09:41] <californaya> SCPingas
[2:09:54] <%razielhex> The Fuzzies are just mogwai
[2:09:54] <star_feline> Is that a fictional author?
[2:09:58] <+floralkami> this seems more like a XK class apocalyptic even
[2:09:59] <+TheNewZealandStory> these fucking computers are a good indicator that i should avoid this game
[2:10:00] <+griffball13> ATHIEST
[2:10:01] <rosemon5001> the void will stab you if you look at it

[2:10:32] <+griffball13> revolution brothers
[2:10:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> I'm not dumb
[2:10:36] <+Pookiedaexzile> Just young
[2:10:38] <gigacanuck> ASMR: Pat Reads Remnant Lore
[2:10:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> And full of the other rhyming word
[2:10:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Are they fuzzy as in "elmo"-like and fur? Or fuzzy as in visual, and you can't see them properly? (Visual camouflage)
[2:10:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> @floralkami Yeah, I assume this lore will move towards every world being the product of a dreamer, and the dreamer's death causes a reality-fuck?
[2:10:56] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami because it's fucking boring and it just keeps going on and on.
[2:10:58] <star_feline> I'm sorry but when I think of fuzzies I think of TRIBBLES
[2:11:07] <%razielhex> Critters
[2:11:11] <%razielhex> with the fur
[2:11:11] <%Cthulos> this is explicitly Lovecraftian Squid1 zoneLemmyL zoneLemmy zoneLemmyR Squid4
[2:11:12] <Mister_McDerp> that escalated quickly
[2:11:14] <exploitativity2> I mean you don't have to read them
[2:11:19] <JayEarly> when I think of fuzzies I get dizzy
[2:11:24] <%GarbageNirvana> This some kinda multiple-dimension Matrix
[2:11:24] <+GenesisKnight> This is why you don't put a mad scientist in charge of things
[2:11:25] <+Nomicro4u> damn fuzzie degenerates
[2:11:27] <%Big_Dream> Pat do want to know how to get a good gun ealry and in ward 13
[2:11:28] <+TheNewZealandStory> then how would i understand the story
[2:11:29] <%arcaderabbit48> "This is terrible and all, but SCIENCE"
[2:11:31] <%razielhex> FuzzyWorld
[2:11:31] <+Pookiedaexzile> Nah nah son.....What we got here is a simple case of muppets
[2:11:31] <cbdg> the Internet
[2:11:32] <zv1neda> Seems like humans messed with things they shouldn't have....yet again
[2:11:32] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory you mean optional story you don't have to read?
[2:11:32] <+AllenDeadman> other worlds
[2:11:34] <gigacanuck> you fools
[2:11:35] <nukle0nik> some bad shit
[2:11:36] <transporterthesequel> Magic Internet
[2:11:38] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dis dick
[2:11:39] <%SergeantSov> Parallel dimensions
[2:11:40] <borous> The connected worlds are 100% real watch what happens

[2:11:47] <%Arxel1> The main router on the magic internet Pat.
[2:11:47] <%Dementedpenguin> 10/10 leap
[2:11:48] <%ThatOneGameTester> i don't know and neither did they
[2:11:48] <+griffball13> leon s kennedy that windo
[2:11:49] <Ner234> Fuck windows
[2:11:49] <star_feline> ACTION ROLL
[2:11:51] <rytisone> just like Leon would have done
[2:11:51] <gigacanuck> noice
[2:11:56] <+Nomicro4u> the internet
[2:11:58] <JayEarly> yes
[2:11:59] <%razielhex> Why does not Erron Black simply use fire to ill the trees
[2:11:59] <Shwepie> That was a really rank bandage.
[2:12:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> disdick
[2:12:00] <manoshake> go back
[2:12:03] <gunzerkingdunce> Each other
[2:12:03] <TheVampiricVamp> Guardians of the Galaxy?
[2:12:04] <%connos_procrastination> windows 98
[2:12:05] <+krozbones> If you need someone to sit down and tell you the story that's uhh... exactly what Pat's doing right now so there's that.
[2:12:06] <ShichiNoBushi> A Myst Age?
[2:12:06] <+TheSaintJohn> have a feeling this game is going to be some kinda Darksiders 4 tie in
[2:12:07] <StromkoPenguin> He was writing that while the corpse was still there? Well I guess everything went to crap very shortly after or it sat there rotting while the bureaucracy whirred
[2:12:09] <rosemon5001> something that doesnt like visitors
[2:12:11] <+primax104> za wardo
[2:12:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> So is this just darksouls with the power of GUN
[2:12:11] <JayEarly> this game is kino
[2:12:13] <+AllenDeadman> they're connecting to some sort of god entities in other worlds?
[2:12:16] <+GenesisKnight> They're bonding to some sort of guardian stand entity on the other side
[2:12:16] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami if I don't read it then how will I understand the story? Maybe the game should find some way to deliver its lore that isn't ridiculously dull
[2:12:17] <+Shotgundam009> They're connecting to internet 2
[2:12:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat btw, don't ever crash through glass. IT SUCKS and I do not recommend it. Glass is hard as fuck and it's like hitting concrete, even if it does break. :|
[2:12:21] <%bevyrage> lore key required
[2:12:23] <Ner234> Shit's locked
[2:12:23] <Zebroneath> The cloth physics look pretty neat.
[2:12:24] <+primax104> it even has patrick seitz as dio
[2:12:29] <manoshake> you can get the key downstairs
[2:12:30] <+floralkami> @generalscpatton oooooh, i like that. kind sounds like a reality anchor fuck up
[2:12:30] <%razielhex> They're using IPv6, the magic of eternal internet
[2:12:31] <TwitchingFrog> I forgot about internet 2
[2:12:35] <thetruenicster> means the game is really good
[2:12:36] <%connos_procrastination> cinematic
[2:12:37] <DracaenaLeaf> Pat's Old lmao
[2:12:37] <DatAsuna> kino = film
[2:12:38] <+Nomicro4u> German for good
[2:12:39] <ShichiNoBushi> Kino's Journey?
[2:12:39] <%Shadowthedigger> Kino is classy, culture. Very good.
[2:12:41] <nukle0nik> kino is a dork ass way of saying cinematic
[2:12:43] <%Arxel1> A Serbian Film is kino pat :^)
[2:12:44] <%dalmek> @AngriestPat Kino is a movie snob term for "very good film"
[2:12:44] <+AllenDeadman> kino's journey
[2:12:46] <+AllenDeadman> a movie
[2:12:46] <+gatoralus> it feels great its a good ass game
[2:12:51] <gunzerkingdunce> @thenewzealandstory I mean, it's the same method as dark souls
[2:12:52] <%Shadowthedigger> As in Kinomatic
[2:12:55] <VJdarkworld> The Dark Knight :)
[2:12:57] <JayEarly> @firearmsinstructor you know from what experience?
[2:12:57] <%razielhex> Cinematic = cino = Kino
[2:12:57] <gigacanuck> "kino"=something about films, anyone who uses it to describe anything other than film is brutally retarded
[2:13:01] <SilverFaustX> kino is cinema in german
[2:13:03] <qwaizy> kino reaves
[2:13:05] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@wolfofsound) (warning)
[2:13:08] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory but it does, through player interaction with NPC's. you don't have to study it right there, dude
[2:13:14] <SpaceGuntank> its a meme word thats overused to describe literally anything
[2:13:16] <+primax104> cinematic, right
[2:13:18] <alrobot2014> moobot wtf
[2:13:18] <$i_am_therydon> connecting to evil within world?
[2:13:20] <EuropanLamprey> Kino is 4chan meme
[2:13:20] <TwitchingFrog> Kino has become corrupted as a term, it's a specific kind of German film which then became a word for good cinema that didn't treat you like a retard, now it is often used to just mean "I like this and think it is good"
[2:13:22] <Mister_McDerp> kino is what people say when they can't describe why they like something
[2:13:24] <VJdarkworld> moobot hiding the meme origins :O
[2:13:26] <+Snirtax> Talk of reality anchors makes this game so much cooler
[2:13:26] <DatAsuna> it's lessjank than i expected when people said souls
[2:13:29] <Gerik1233> so is dark souls
[2:13:31] <DetroitSentai> Using Kino is like using "Film" or "cinema" instead of movie
[2:13:33] <+TheNewZealandStory> @gunzerkingdunce dark souls doesn't have you reading what are essentially entire wikipedia entries. also I don't like dark souls
[2:13:34] <+Nomicro4u> LOL deleted
[2:13:35] <nukle0nik> that fuse was already there lol
[2:13:35] <%Dementedpenguin> Moobot apatFist
[2:13:37] <star_feline> Moobot censoring the masses D:
[2:13:39] <%razielhex> Kino is most likely from TVIV in SomethingAwful
[2:13:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Kine is german for poopoo peepee party
[2:13:43] <SilverFaustX> moobot dont like that
[2:13:43] <+allups> WOW
[2:13:44] <+floralkami> I've never heard that word.
[2:13:45] <alrobot2014> they didn't even put in a link
[2:13:45] <DatAsuna> it's pretty bad that when people pitch a game as souls like i expect it to be jank as hell
[2:13:52] <nukle0nik> this looks like a boss room
[2:13:54] <Crushter> It's a meme from the tv board, technically, didn't know slashes would count as a link
[2:13:56] <alrobot2014> they just put slash tv slash
[2:13:58] <exploitativity2> wait are 4chan boards banned words here?
[2:13:58] <+OSDevon> Hi
[2:14:00] <FirearmsInstructor> @JayEarly unfortunately yes. Went to run outside as a little kid at my mom's friend's house. Didn't know they had a glass door that was closed. Thought it was an open doorway and man did it suck. Thankfully I didn't get cut, but I was bruised over like 10% of my body.
[2:14:04] <%GarbageNirvana> It's true
[2:14:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> WOAH
[2:14:10] <gunzerkingdunce> @angriestpat fan go off
[2:14:11] <+Animefreak369> To get through the fan you can turn the power back off
[2:14:11] <%keyworthe> what game isn't jank
[2:14:11] <+Nomicro4u> why is 4chan not a banned word then
[2:14:12] <DetroitSentai> jank is good
[2:14:15] <%keyworthe> every game is jank
[2:14:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @JayEarly Face, arms, chest, one leg... not fun.
[2:14:16] <star_feline> WOah that hot take
[2:14:16] <+Pookiedaexzile> Too far
[2:14:18] <captainnathaniel> we are on SCP territory now
[2:14:18] <DatAsuna> the souls game are frequently more jank than the likes tbh
[2:14:19] <+Nomicro4u> moobot?????
[2:14:19] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory yes, but each and ever item has it's own description you can spend hours trying to decipher if you want
[2:14:24] <+krozbones> It works though. I love the fighting in this game and I've yet to be struck by a big ol magic shockwave from an enemy attack
[2:14:27] <cosmicdischarge> yes
[2:14:29] <+Animefreak369> Yes
[2:14:30] <+unknowingchuck> yes
[2:14:30] <Crushter> @exploitativity2 I think twitch things the slashes indicate links
[2:14:30] <+Sindellah> Yes

[2:14:34] <gunzerkingdunce> Yes
[2:14:34] <+Delror> please get it, yes
[2:14:34] <%aishman> YES
[2:14:34] <CaptainFrankincense> yes
[2:14:35] <+GenesisKnight> More experience is always good
[2:14:35] <+AntithesisEK> DS1 mad jank, so many pvp movement tricks
[2:14:35] <Ariddic> yes
[2:14:37] <DatAsuna> I've been using bows/crossbows making another alt to invade paige with
[2:14:37] <kilbert66> More exp means more traits
[2:14:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> yes
[2:14:38] <DatAsuna> and boy
[2:14:39] <aeonicvector> no makes game too easy
[2:14:39] <%SergeantSov> Its free XP
[2:14:42] <Cendov> Yes, you have no max level so it's worth
[2:14:43] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat that fan looks pretty big huh like big enough to walk through mizzThinking
[2:14:43] <DatAsuna> bows are peak jank in souls
[2:14:44] <Crushter> Elder is the one you should max first, is what everyone tells me
[2:14:47] <thetruenicster> Elder Knowledge? that sounds like some Cthulu shit
[2:14:47] <+OSDevon> I can't believe you really asked what the bandage does.
[2:14:48] <+gatoralus> it will pay for itself and more
[2:14:49] <%Arxel1> You get a talent reset item later. so get XP for MAX TALENT GAIN
[2:14:49] <+ArcLifth> It also sounds like so cthulu shit
[2:14:50] <+Lost_Zombie> Max it first
[2:14:52] <%Gogogolem> i have no idea
[2:14:53] <borous> get that KNAWLEGE
[2:14:55] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami but I don't care and never said dark souls was preferable in the first place
[2:14:57] <EuropanLamprey> @Nomicro4u wait, what word is banned?
[2:14:57] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s free real estate
[2:14:58] <mikash81> honey, pick up some elder knowledge from the shop on your way back
[2:14:59] <cosmicdischarge> max elder @AngriestPat
[2:14:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> Pat just called Bloodborne Jank live on stream, someone notify the masses

[2:15:04] <VJdarkworld> :(
[2:15:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> I believe levels cap out at 1500 xp
[2:15:06] <+Animefreak369> Turn the power back off
[2:15:07] <+shin_phil> Spoilers: Pat youre gonna have to shoot a gun.
[2:15:07] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat can you shoot the fan?
[2:15:09] <eco419> do it
[2:15:14] <manoshake> turn the energy off
[2:15:16] <Crushter> souls games are jank but they're good jank
[2:15:17] <JayEarly> a lot of Souls clones are European in origin so you get the Eurojank on top of the Souls jank
[2:15:18] <gustavozxd> all jank is good said the omikron fan
[2:15:22] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory if a game has an in depht story, don't expect it to be short. you used it as a counterexample, so it was viewed as such
[2:15:27] <MrGreenToS> there is a way to get pass a fan
[2:15:31] <transporterthesequel> Oh noo
[2:15:32] <+OSDevon> A peepee box!
[2:15:33] <+krozbones> Pretty much the old world realized that if it's made of wood it's a great place to hide your metal bits.
[2:15:36] <transporterthesequel> Someone is theeer
[2:15:40] <+AllenDeadman> the set you had at the begining increases the chances of scrap being dropped
[2:15:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dat dank shit

[2:16:29] <rytisone> Pat's couch gets up and leaves
[2:16:31] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I'm not complaining about the story existing, I'm complaining about the story being presented in the driest, most boring, tedious way possible
[2:16:35] <+Delror> @nukle0nik how does it seem unbalanced
[2:16:35] <rosemon5001> tons of scrap and that 1 piece of iron
[2:16:35] <TwitchingFrog> Has a reason been stated for the name "Fuzzy World"?
[2:16:36] <+xGreenflame> Gotta break furniture for you red orbs
[2:16:37] <%razielhex> *The chair has dodged*
[2:16:38] <+krozbones> @hax_metatron The are he's in can be accessed almost immediately
[2:16:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat This place actually isn't abandoned. The scientists are just at lunch. They come back and are like "WTF HAPPENED TO THE CHAIRS!?" xD
[2:16:50] <ShichiNoBushi> No one gets to sit!!

[2:17:05] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat this is byrgenwerth if it was on our world
[2:17:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> So what is this? 1980s apocolipse scifi souls?
[2:17:07] <%Dementedpenguin> You would think that room would have better security.....
[2:17:07] <TheVampiricVamp> "Hello fellow workers, let's do some bullshit today"
[2:17:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you missed a green thing behind the door
[2:17:20] <+hax_metatron> @krozbones So can I start watching from here or is it worth going back in the stream at all? Don’t know anything about the game

[2:17:54] <+king_of_beggars> There was a dragon. They said there was a dragon. This is a Dragon's Dogma.
[2:17:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stranger souls
[2:17:55] <+AllenDeadman> he got it
[2:17:59] <uncledickbutt> like cheap gas
[2:18:02] <%Cthulos> More Lovecraft Elder Being shit than anything

[2:18:06] <stolando_florida> THE LOCKER, PAT! THE LOCKER!
[2:18:06] <manoshake> turn the energy off and go through the fan
[2:18:08] <+allups> LUL @Crushter
[2:18:09] <stolando_florida> sarcasm
[2:18:10] <cosmicdischarge> not that door
[2:18:16] <+capnbeeb> it's the metal gear hallway
[2:18:16] <%Cthulos> there are sentient plant aliens
[2:18:16] <cosmicdischarge> other one
[2:18:16] <ShichiNoBushi> Microwave hallway?
[2:18:16] <FirearmsInstructor> pop tarts!
[2:18:17] <nukle0nik> it's the microwave hallway from MGS4
[2:18:18] <alrobot2014> @king_of_beggars is the dragon here to continue a cycle of finding people to become god?
[2:18:20] <%WackyGear> locker
[2:18:20] <%radda343> it's where they made their hot pockets
[2:18:21] <+king_of_beggars> METAL GEEEARRRR
[2:18:22] <%Odetokale> turn the power off to get behind the fan.
[2:18:23] <Lutre> microwave hallway? monkaS
[2:18:23] <KaliasTV> Microwave Hazard: Food too hot
[2:18:24] <cbdg> microwave hazard? is that the lunch room?
[2:18:24] <BlindGato> Behind FAN
[2:18:24] <TheVampiricVamp> Cooking giant pop-corns i see Kappa

[2:18:29] <+gatoralus> pat the power
[2:18:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> SHUTOFF POWER TO FAN
[2:18:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> remove the fuse?
[2:18:31] <manoshake> go behind fan
[2:18:32] <%brave_sj> Yeah but it destroyed the Soviet Union didn't it? If so mission accomplished
[2:18:32] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami Either tighten that shit up to be more succinct, or have better cutscenes that are more informative. I guarantee this shit aint any more in depth than a classic Silent Hill game, and those games have you read very little
[2:18:33] <Tucker0603> turn off power
[2:18:33] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat you missed the computer on the microwave room
[2:18:33] <a_mad_dragon> turn power off again
[2:18:34] <transporterthesequel> Turn off the power
[2:18:34] <gogorobos> Turn off th electricity
[2:18:35] <+Sindellah> The breaker with the fuse
[2:18:37] <+gatoralus> you can turn off the power bruh
[2:18:37] <manoshake> turn the energy off
[2:18:39] <+GenesisKnight> Turn off the power
[2:18:39] <AlanJoestar> TURN OF THE POWAH
[2:18:40] <%croxeye> turn off the power pat
[2:18:41] <energywarning> they wanted to see if they could heat up 10000 packages of microwave ready dinners at once
[2:18:42] <MrGreenToS> Hit up fuse again to get pass fan
[2:18:43] <%Cthulos> they reverse engineered that tech and stingered the hewmons
[2:18:45] <Crushter> @AngriestPat those walls are for the inside of a radiation chamber, that's why they're bubbled
[2:18:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> oh god pat really
[2:18:51] <+GenesisKnight> Galaxy Brain
[2:18:52] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat been levleing mch and man they have buttons to press
[2:18:52] <%Dementedpenguin> Just put your hat there like Kung Lao
[2:18:54] <+ArcLifth> Puzzle solved
[2:18:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> pat plz
[2:18:58] <eco419> mendoT
[2:19:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> thats actually kinda cool
[2:19:04] <%Keeble24> Pat did BIG THINK good job!
[2:19:05] <star_feline> Kappa puzzle
[2:19:06] <TheVampiricVamp> Puzzle defeated
[2:19:07] <Crushter> apparently there are some real puzzles later
[2:19:13] <kilbert66> Well, I'm apparently braindead.
[2:19:13] <+king_of_beggars> @alrobot2014 His corpse is going to turn us all into Nier.
[2:19:17] <Crushter> this looks fun
[2:19:18] <RantingRavager> BOSS WEAPONS?
[2:19:21] <+primax104> is this also procedural?
[2:19:23] <a_mad_dragon> find the door first
[2:19:25] <alrobot2014> oh no not angelus again
[2:19:30] <+primax104> like the ward basement
[2:19:35] <%Dementedpenguin> I forgot the Surge existed.
[2:19:36] <rosemon5001> surge 2 looks dope tho @AngriestPat
[2:19:38] <+Pookiedaexzile> Oh shit son
[2:19:41] <kilbert66> Overworlds and dungeons are procedural, I don't think the layout of the ward is
[2:19:42] <%keyworthe> gun souls is pretty cool
[2:19:44] <mark_collins45> just like real life
[2:19:48] <+Pookiedaexzile> But can you wall bounce
[2:19:50] <%Ascethetic> how much is this game? i dont feel like booting up steam
[2:19:53] <a_mad_dragon> DOOR
[2:19:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> its a key
[2:19:55] <%bevyrage> it's the other door
[2:19:56] <foreverN2dust> !uptime
[2:19:56] <%bevyrage> ye ye
[2:19:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 19m.
[2:19:57] <%Calek> apparently there's an update coming where the random thing isn't an issue
[2:20:00] <%Calek> like an Adventure Mode
[2:20:04] <Crushter> why would you compare this to the surge since its more roguelike @AngriestPat just cause they're both in the genre?
[2:20:13] <JayEarly> yo that’s some RE shit
[2:20:14] <star_feline> Hey that's no bad
[2:20:15] <%keyworthe> it really feels like a double A game
[2:20:16] <whittacre> yesss
[2:20:17] <whittacre> the AA game
[2:20:17] <Mister_McDerp> game looks pretty good
[2:20:18] <+DangerMan83> $54 in Canadian Tire money
[2:20:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> So its Steam saleable
[2:20:23] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> I dont get it, it was cheaper for me
[2:20:23] <gustavozxd> is JoJo eye of heaven good?
[2:20:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Seed generation?
[2:20:24] <+gatoralus> its like at the absolute top tier of AA too its good
[2:20:25] <%bevyrage> why would you compare games outside of one another's genre?
[2:20:27] <%vaporousTippler> 40 feels pretty fucking spot on for this.
[2:20:27] <whittacre> we need more A-AA games
[2:20:27] <@SSaryn> What DOES that mean
[2:20:28] <Floofiie> Everybody's campaign is rng
[2:20:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> dats 20 bucks on a good day
[2:20:29] <uncledickbutt> maybe its random but with some thought putt into it , that would be best
[2:20:30] <manoshake> adventure mode
[2:20:30] <+king_of_beggars> Double-AAAAAYYYYYYY
[2:20:31] <aeonicvector> a no procedrual mod/seeds maybe?
[2:20:31] <Ericgi231> The randomization is weird as shit. You only get to fight like half the bosses in one playthrough. So you get half of the unique weapons and abilities.
[2:20:33] <%Ascethetic> @AngriestPat you picking up astral chain?
[2:20:35] <+allups> i like the random. its makes it better for New game+
[2:20:36] <%Calek> I dunno just read an article that said that
[2:20:39] <+RocketAttila> Believe in me, the complete random person on twitch that this game is amazing!
[2:20:51] <DatAsuna> locked seed isn't the issue
[2:20:55] <exploitativity2> @RocketAttila I don't like your tone
[2:20:57] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory a gamelike Silent Hill showed instead of tell and was made to be vague. Silent Hill barely has an origin, other than simply existing in people's minds. an example like that doesn't work in this argument cause this game isn't focused on story, nor is it told in a vague concept, but rather (this is how shit got fucked, fyi)
[2:20:57] <captainspauldin> is surge bad?
[2:20:58] <AnIrishPapaya> Does anyone think that the game looks great except for the character models/ cutscenes?
[2:21:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> @RocketAttila Can. You. Wall. bounce.
[2:21:01] <exploitativity2> also I don't know who or what you're talking about
[2:21:03] <DatAsuna> It's that the levels are made of prefabs
[2:21:06] <%bevyrage> 'this ace combat game is real fast compared to need for speed'
[2:21:06] <+gatoralus> it is pretty awesome tho @RocketAttila
[2:21:06] <%Ascethetic> surge is okay but its super jank
[2:21:07] <nukle0nik> lol gotta check the door agian
[2:21:09] <stolando_florida> I'm also a random person on twitch and absolutely love this game and can't wait for more.
[2:21:09] <Crushter> Well they are in similar genre's, but I feel that they're pretty significantly different
[2:21:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> GUN
[2:21:20] <rosemon5001> GUN MAGIC
[2:21:20] <star_feline> Hell yeah
[2:21:21] <+Cardz_> SMG
[2:21:22] <%Dementedpenguin> Jesus christ, I just realized how loaded that guy's backpack is
[2:21:22] <Tucker0603> SMG
[2:21:23] <Ropcord> G U N
[2:21:24] <rytisone> TMP
[2:21:24] <nukle0nik> brap brap brap
[2:21:25] <+allups> Yes i dint get tht my 1st run
[2:21:26] <DatAsuna> I like RNG map generation
[2:21:27] <JayEarly> yes i love these RE2 closeups
[2:21:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Purp
[2:21:28] <+RocketAttila> @Pookiedaexzile with enough commitment, any game has wall bounce.
[2:21:29] <+Denshoni> das a gud gun
[2:21:30] <Mister_McDerp> GUN GET
[2:21:33] <DatAsuna> just not in games like this that do a lot of exploration
[2:21:34] <masterfire23> @@@@@@@@@@@@@
[2:21:35] <exploitativity2> wait were you being sincere? then nevermind
[2:21:41] <+Cardz_> G U N
[2:21:51] <DatAsuna> I don't wanna explore RNG maps, I just want them as RNG arenas .etc
[2:21:55] <gigacanuck> oh boy
[2:21:56] <star_feline> Microsoft LUL
[2:21:59] <%keyworthe> thought i saw microsoft fly of the table
[2:22:03] <+primax104> psychokinetic?
[2:22:07] <%Laecerelius> Psycher bullshit!
[2:22:08] <grimporio> Thanks for the FightCookie @bane_kaikyo
[2:22:09] <+primax104> PSK Fire
[2:22:11] <gigacanuck> 13 year old?
[2:22:12] <Mister_McDerp> psychic powers
[2:22:19] <zv1neda> O h
[2:22:19] <%Ascethetic> what did Kenny do to her??
[2:22:19] <+krozbones> Since you get to keep stuff you get when you join other people's games you can get all kinds of cool junk just by playing with randos. Gear, xp, scrap, irons, etc
[2:22:19] <+ArcLifth> jeez
[2:22:19] <poweredscoot> stand powers
[2:22:20] <Crushter> @DatAsuna but the point of the game is to be more Roguelike than set like Dark Souls
[2:22:22] <%GarbageNirvana> eesh
[2:22:29] <+RocketAttila> For real though I beat this game yesterday and I had a fun time with it. On new game+ for it now.
[2:22:30] <captainnathaniel> they were doing this stuff to 13 YEARS OLDS?
[2:22:30] <Mister_McDerp> damn psykers
[2:22:36] <transporterthesequel> Ohh it's a pistol!
[2:22:41] <star_feline> I imagine you have to fight Clementine?
[2:22:41] <+primax104> we earthbound now boyz
[2:22:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> oh great these are children!!
[2:22:43] <+gatoralus> the smg is real good pat
[2:22:45] <FirearmsInstructor> What is "bloodwort"? What are the quick items on the bottom left? Garlic??
[2:22:47] <%Laecerelius> So a psyker got daemon possessed and everything turned to shit, I guess
[2:22:54] <FirearmsInstructor> Can't see behind pat's frame.
[2:22:57] <%Wintermute_VRC> !uptime
[2:22:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 22m.
[2:22:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Laecerelius I guess
[2:22:59] <JayEarly> so we got a little bit of FEAR in this totally ethical science stew
[2:23:00] <aeonicvector> Smg is kinda garbage imop, but good if your using a slowfire primary
[2:23:03] <%keyworthe> im so far into the game and i haven't gotten that gun yet
[2:23:05] <+Sindellah> Nah, no rarity
[2:23:06] <%Gogogolem> don't know
[2:23:06] <+Rezca> Nope the weapon is a weapon
[2:23:07] <@SSaryn> Not really, regular wepaons and boss weapons basically.
[2:23:08] <Ropcord> it's souls, guns are guns
[2:23:09] <%SergeantSov> Nope
[2:23:09] <rosemon5001> when you connect to chtulu land you gain instant insanity +999
[2:23:10] <Cendov> No rarity, just normal and boss weapons iirc
[2:23:11] <manoshake> there are boss weapons
[2:23:11] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> nope just normal weapons and boss weapons
[2:23:12] <+AllenDeadman> ope
[2:23:13] <borous> There are weapons and boss weapons, that it
[2:23:14] <stolando_florida> @FirearmsInstructor BLoodwort is like a DS2 lifegem. The garlic is frenzy dust which increases your ROF and reload speed
[2:23:15] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat think darksouls rules, no rarity but only one source per item
[2:23:16] <manoshake> secret weapons
[2:23:16] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory more cutscenes would lead to a MGS4 problem, and this is only the first part of the game. also, i don't see how this is bland for giving text to read when EVERY game with story rich content does the same?
[2:23:16] <+krozbones> It's souls style. You find that SMG? That is the SMG. they are all the same minus how much + you give them
[2:23:17] <Teyaric> strictly set gear - think souls, not loot shooter
[2:23:18] <zv1neda> no rarity weapons
[2:23:21] <%bevyrage> thank god there's no rarity
[2:23:21] <Ropcord> it's purple because that's just what equippable items look like
[2:23:23] <+linSP> is this number go up souls
[2:23:24] <BlindGato> You got guns and BOSSguns
[2:23:28] <gigacanuck> >going berserk because you ate some garlic
[2:23:34] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami Isn't showing rather than telling what you're suppose to be doing if possible? Also, your Silent Hill lore is wrong, and the games aren't vague. If this game isn't focused on the story, then why are there fucking paragraphs and paragraphs of dry text
[2:23:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Damage per cartridge and fire rate? Might have to do quick maths.
[2:23:36] <+AllenDeadman> there are some weapons you can get by killing a boss in a specific way iirc
[2:23:41] <RupanSen> Rarity on items is cancer, real mad that's what they're doing with CP77
[2:23:43] <star_feline> Howdy Lee
[2:23:49] <JayEarly> @gigacanuck seems legit to me
[2:23:49] <+primax104> Lets visit Dio
[2:23:53] <manoshake> buy some mods too pat
[2:23:54] <zv1neda> @angriestpat Normal weapons go to +20 boss weapons go to +10
[2:23:56] <AnIrishPapaya> Did somebody say BOSS weapoooooons?
[2:23:58] <%wolfofsound> Well that's the last time I say THAT
[2:23:59] <nukle0nik> imagine yelling some guy, clearly running past you, "i'm not in the mood for chat"
[2:24:00] <manoshake> fire mod is really useful
[2:24:05] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> yeah most big bosses have an alternate kill condition that changes the boss weapon you get @AngriestPat
[2:24:06] <+primax104> this is patrick seitz right?
[2:24:14] <manoshake> buy fire mod pat
[2:24:21] <Picia000123> You can always go pacifist run in CP77 tho
[2:24:24] <star_feline> Imagine reacting "keep moving" towards someone shooting
[2:24:24] <%Calek> @AnIrishPapaya Boss Weapons!
[2:24:30] <Teyaric> Tail cuts on dragons get better gear kind of system- one boss has a spear stuck in, you stagger him to yank it out, another has a giant tail
[2:24:32] <%Laecerelius> Ah, so it does the Lords of the Fallen thing
[2:24:35] <foreverN2dust> @heckubrickyillneverdie no point in telling people really unless they want to be spoiled
[2:24:36] <%Schrodingers_Box> So like surge?
[2:24:38] <Ropcord> wait what 👀
[2:24:42] <gigacanuck> @Picia000123 going pacifist in a cyberpunk dystopia Kappa
[2:24:48] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat enjoy the first easy enemies, this game will make you rage
[2:24:48] <@SSaryn> wat
[2:24:52] <exploitativity2> RESOLUTION OH GOD OH FUCK
[2:24:52] <@SSaryn> excuse me
[2:24:53] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is this like dark souls where if you rest at a bonfire the enemies reset?
[2:24:54] <%cureneckbeard> right down the road
[2:24:54] <+RocketAttila> @Laecerelius is lords of the fallen worth my time?
[2:24:54] <@SSaryn> hello
[2:24:54] <%croxeye> smg is good
[2:24:54] <star_feline> Nah son, Rip and Tear

[2:24:58] <+Cardz_> nice
[2:24:58] <%Laecerelius> No
[2:24:58] <Cendov> Euro jank
[2:24:58] <Picia000123> @gigacanuck I mean, it's an option :P
[2:24:58] <californaya> neat
[2:24:59] <Ner234> Uh oh
[2:24:59] <+ArcLifth> resolution oh no
[2:25:01] <Ner234> JANK
[2:25:02] <+griffball13> enhance zoom
[2:25:02] <exploitativity2> z o o m
[2:25:04] <Jolnir> sewer level is apparently half the game
[2:25:04] <ittla> praise jank
[2:25:05] <%Laecerelius> It's really not
[2:25:06] <@SSaryn> huh
[2:25:06] <energywarning> closer! we must get closer!
[2:25:08] <%Arxel1> ZOOOM
[2:25:09] <Mister_McDerp> Z O O M
[2:25:09] <Ion_Laser> That is some Jank there
[2:25:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Dynamic resolution?
[2:25:10] <EuropanLamprey> This game does not like to be streamed
[2:25:10] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @foreverN2dust thats not even a spoiler, it would be a spoiler if I told him all the kill conditions.
[2:25:11] <+Rezca> the Jank in action
[2:25:11] <+primax104> professor ZOOOM
[2:25:13] <%unrolls> apatHoldon
[2:25:13] <gigacanuck> @Picia000123 okay Ghandi
[2:25:13] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Wahey
[2:25:14] <+Cardz_> Z O O M
[2:25:14] <%radda343> no it's fine
[2:25:14] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory bruh, you understand the words "optional, first part, can learn through playing?" and Silent Hill was vague, at least the few that are good. the player is supposed to think about the deeper meaning. there is no deeper meaning here
[2:25:15] <stolando_florida> @Jolnir sewer is not half the game. or even close lmao
[2:25:15] <+griffball13> because jank
[2:25:17] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> which I dont even know
[2:25:19] <Teyaric> oh you're not on ps4 are you? huge crash bugs
[2:25:21] <%razielhex> got that Star Trek: INto Darkness zoom
[2:25:21] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami you don't need to MGS4 levels of cutscenes to tell an engaging story; and I've yet to see a 'story rich game' that relies on just having you straight up read paragraphs and paragraphs of text every couple of minutes
[2:25:22] <+Nomicro4u> because it is good to do
[2:25:22] <+krozbones> X-treme over shoulder ballistic action!
[2:25:22] <Jolnir> apparently it is
[2:25:23] <%radda343> the jank is why we come
[2:25:25] <zv1neda> example without spoiling you can shoot a part of a boss to get a different drop that would make a different weapon
[2:25:26] <rytisone> programming is hard
[2:25:26] <%unrolls> apatBig apatWrong
[2:25:27] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Did you have zoom / aim down sites held when zoning or triggering a zone change?
[2:25:27] <@SSaryn> I've straight up never seen that.
[2:25:31] <Picia000123> Did the game die?
[2:25:32] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Z O O M apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace

[2:26:19] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Some source-engine based games get bugged out with a locked zoom if you zone while scoped in or aiming down sites.
[2:26:19] <derap41> early onset alzheimers?
[2:26:31] <energywarning> it's like finding 20 dollars in your jacket pocket that you forgot about. except that 20 bucks screams at you.
[2:26:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> this is very subdued but it looks a bit...Darksiders ish
[2:26:35] <%radda343> is time for baby
[2:26:40] <zv1neda> @angriestpat did you see yain garuga is back in iceborne
[2:26:41] <RupanSen> he was wet, remember?

[2:26:46] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory bruh, every couple of minutes? is this your first time seeing this game? YOU DON'T need to read it, but it is there if you want. that's why it's hub world tex
[2:26:46] <%WackyGear> not bay but bebe
[2:26:47] <Teyaric> darksiders dev's made it
[2:26:50] <alrobot2014> did his piss dry?
[2:26:50] <+Nomicro4u> Elmo wanted camera time
[2:26:52] <star_feline> Pat why you keep kissing the pee pee baby
[2:26:56] <gigacanuck> @energywarning you mean Elmo can be exchanged for goods and services?
[2:27:01] <+primax104> @doc_ock_rokc same studio as darksiders 3 i think
[2:27:06] <EuropanLamprey> It's okay Pat, Elmo has just been leveling up his stealth stat
[2:27:09] <chaseyd> I really need to make a compilation of all the times Pat's been such a good guy to Elmo.
[2:27:10] <justaguy3> darksiders 2 and 3
[2:27:13] <%keyworthe> isn't the team working on this game like really fucking small?
[2:27:14] <+linSP> doesnt he climb in the toilet
[2:27:14] <+Nomicro4u> He flop
[2:27:17] <Skeletonmanners> its by Darksiders 2 and 3 guys ye
[2:27:19] <%ItsRatman> Dont it takes it sees

[2:27:24] <ShichiNoBushi> The One Ring?
[2:27:25] <rytisone> The cake is a lie
[2:27:26] <splicerss> Hello fuqboys
[2:27:27] <%wolfofsound> monkaS
[2:27:30] <nukle0nik> dark? not really
[2:27:31] <Crushter> its a super small team yeah
[2:27:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[2:27:40] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory the only reason you saw it all now at once if cause Pat chose to read it all, for his own enjoyment.
[2:27:40] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami Silent Hill isn't vague at all. The games have symbolism, but the stories are told with concrete details and characters. I don't care whether this is optional or if its just in the beginning, it's a shit way of conveying information
[2:27:44] <KaliasTV> This is Paige levels of dark
[2:27:47] <JayEarly> not that hard to see really
[2:27:47] <+Nomicro4u> those almost look like flood
[2:27:48] <nukle0nik> i don't think those are the enemies to melee
[2:27:49] <+primax104> boomers
[2:27:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> he's definitely been there since like five minutes after you said he was wet.
[2:27:50] <+mmack093> Is this really gun souls?
[2:27:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> The little ones are melee fodder
[2:27:54] <%bevyrage> oh hey are these the fuzzies?
[2:27:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Moment I saw that thing running up I thought that was a splodey boy
[2:27:58] <%WackyGear> mushroom monsters!
[2:27:58] <+gatoralus> yeah gunfire games they made DS3 and are small like 63 people. they did gud
[2:28:00] <star_feline> Are those the fuzzies?
[2:28:08] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory can you just accept you don't like reading?
[2:28:09] <rytisone> who is he talking to?
[2:28:20] <captainnathaniel> so the fuzzies got into our world?
[2:28:23] <ittla> this looks soulsy but the gameplay seems identical to that of a horde shooter
[2:28:26] <VJdarkworld> reedus and the funky fuzzies
[2:28:26] <gigacanuck> corrupted fuzzies
[2:28:27] <JayEarly> I take it those are supposed to be co-op barks
[2:28:28] <Crushter> its impressive that this game seems more quality than Darksiders 3
[2:28:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> okay see this enemy rush is what I wanted to see out this game
[2:28:33] <ShichiNoBushi> Don't touch them or else you get dizzy.
[2:28:41] <%bevyrage> hehehe, ye
[2:28:47] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I don't like reading paragraphs and paragraphs of dry text, barely spaced even a minute apart, no
[2:28:48] <%Calek> @CommanderSqueaks you ain't seen nothing yet
[2:28:53] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory not every thing has the budget and direction for hours of cutscenes to explain everything.
[2:28:59] <ssks123> ive been replaying on hard and those tiny guys bum rush the fuck out of you
[2:29:06] <%WackyGear> break the barrels pat
[2:29:07] <ssks123> its pretty great and also stressful
[2:29:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> I prefer being in an enclosed space with this kind of combat
[2:29:16] <star_feline> NICe
[2:29:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Joe mads styleis kinda here its like they couldn't unlearn it
[2:29:23] <nukle0nik> are they little goblins with knives?
[2:29:29] <+Nomicro4u> take that fatherless blobs
[2:29:30] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I don't care if it doesn't have the budget, fuck it. Find a better way of telling your story anyway
[2:29:32] <+ArcLifth> I love when pat and the character match up
[2:29:33] <%bevyrage> sweet
[2:29:38] <%radda343> these things are like tiny evil Teddies from P4
[2:29:42] <Crushter> spooks
[2:29:45] <exploitativity2> this looks fun
[2:29:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Does the damage vary by range? Rounds that impact at medium / long range have less velocity, and therefore less damage. Is that reflected in the gameplay?
[2:29:48] <a_mad_dragon> SPEND THAT POINT
[2:29:50] <+gatoralus> this has some sick enemy designs
[2:29:54] <+mmack093> Why do people compare this to dark souls? IT seems easier
[2:29:55] <IronGlorfindel> are those little dudes the fuzzies?
[2:30:00] <%Mythicalbrit> are those fucked up cupcake monsters?
[2:30:01] <aero160h> This game has no rarity, it's not a shlooter. Boss weapons are a thing. multiple bosses have different conditions to beat them to receive a different weapon from them. bosses are randomly generated as are the game world's. meaning, you might not get the boss you want in your campaign. some bosses are set. There is one randomly generated npc merchant in final area of the game, bummer.
[2:30:01] <stolando_florida> Yes, Firearms.
[2:30:01] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory you sound ignorant, and the kind of person to make Assassin's Creed game of the year.
[2:30:04] <+Cardz_> PAT
[2:30:04] <Crushter> art direction seems nice
[2:30:05] <@SSaryn> Ot
[2:30:06] <MarylandJutsu> little fuzzies are like EMLO
[2:30:06] <nukle0nik> you missed a thing to your left pat
[2:30:08] <nukle0nik> behind you
[2:30:08] <%Scarnehu> Scarnehu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I'd be here if not for hosting my wife's 33rd birthday party today. Keep it up big stumbo and I'll catch you on the VoD
[2:30:11] <+Cardz_> BLIND
[2:30:12] <+dirtyh4rr1> missed a thign!
[2:30:15] <+Zxtole> Just get more money to develop your game Jebaited
[2:30:18] <AlanJoestar> FirearmsInstructor it does for the shotgun atleast. i know that
[2:30:22] <+krozbones> The little dudes still look like twisted vines, unless the Root like... took them over xenomorph style?
[2:30:23] <nukle0nik> behind the door
[2:30:24] <exploitativity2> difficulty isn't the defining characteristic of dark souls as much as specific design elements are
[2:30:25] <%Odetokale> go back
[2:30:28] <%worldbrand> how is this so far? what does it rate on the gamepro scale of facial expressions?
[2:30:28] <+Nomicro4u> wow his wife gets 33 parties for her birthday
[2:30:31] <@SSaryn> It's... kinda like what if a Dark Souls had the randomizer put in.
[2:30:34] <+DangerMan83> there was a chest in there too lol
[2:30:35] <cosmicdischarge> back
[2:30:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @AlanJoestar That makes sense. Thanks.
[2:30:36] <+Cardz_> Goddamnit
[2:30:37] <+Lost_Zombie> still missed it
[2:30:38] <cosmicdischarge> box
[2:30:38] <stolando_florida> Every weapon has a max effective range and it does less damage the further away you are
[2:30:38] <+Lost_Zombie> lmfao
[2:30:43] <cosmicdischarge> you blind man
[2:30:45] <ShichiNoBushi> I, Ron.
[2:30:49] <+Cardz_> He still misses it
[2:30:49] <a_mad_dragon> it's chalice dungeon the game
[2:30:55] <%Calek> it's basically Bloodborne Chalice Dungeons: The Game but you shoot things instead
[2:30:56] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I'm ignorant because I don't like bad storytelling in games? What the fuck does Assassin's Creed have to do with anything? I can't stand that series
[2:30:59] <%arcaderabbit48> It doesnt matter if he misses stuff
[2:31:03] <splicerss> Is there character creation?
[2:31:03] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory it's not even integral to the gameplay, yet you sitting there mad that you gotta read to lknow what happened before
[2:31:21] <%Lammchen> Based on what you’ve played so far would you say the game is worth $40 usd?i was thinking about picking it up and then convincing friends to do the same
[2:31:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its the unholy lovechild of Warframe dark souls anddarksiders
[2:31:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sodium content high in stream chat
[2:31:31] <stolando_florida> @splicerss yes it's kind of basic though. doesn't matter too much since you'll be covering yourself in armor
[2:31:32] <%GarbageNirvana> oof
[2:31:33] <Crushter> oh shit
[2:31:35] <exploitativity2> THAT'S A LOTTA DAMAGE
[2:31:35] <+smevvster> Just a Kiwi angry about reading
[2:31:36] <a_mad_dragon> I N F E C T E D
[2:31:37] <+Nomicro4u> INFECTED
[2:31:39] <star_feline> ! INFECTED !
[2:31:41] <+krozbones> I haaaaate Infection
[2:31:42] <%worldbrand> ! INFECTED !
[2:31:45] <cosmicdischarge> you missed a box
[2:31:47] <Crushter> ! THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE !
[2:31:47] <cosmicdischarge> you blind man
[2:31:47] <JayEarly> that’s a nice shotgun
[2:31:50] <+Nomicro4u> AIIIIIIIIIIIIDS
[2:31:50] <+Cardz_> I N F E C T E D
[2:31:50] <%salty_syd913> ! INFECTED !
[2:31:50] <+ArcLifth> ! infected !
[2:31:50] <splicerss> Looks cool so far
[2:31:53] <stolando_florida> @AngriestPat drink the green oilskin potion to cure
[2:31:54] <Ominnous> damn he stiled on you
[2:31:56] <gigacanuck> need to use consumables
[2:31:57] <Ominnous> styled*
[2:32:04] <JayEarly> what does infection do?
[2:32:04] <justaguy3> infected it's kinda anoying LYL
[2:32:06] <theKingRamses> the thing you missed was apparently a chest
[2:32:12] <+krozbones> That cough will interrupt everything at the worst times and essentially fuck you
[2:32:13] <justaguy3> @JayEarly makes you coff
[2:32:15] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat missed a chest in that room
[2:32:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Seems like the trade-off is you get to use it fewer times
[2:32:28] <@SSaryn> Give that to Reg when you get back.
[2:32:34] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory but it isn't even storytelling, it's flavor text. it doesn't stop you in the middle of your game to read, so you're complaining that it exists. like, if that text wasn't there with no other change, you wouldn't be complaining in the first place
[2:32:34] <%worldbrand> I bet it increases poise
[2:32:37] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami do you know just HOW MANY lower budget/indie games rely on just making you read entire fucking essays every other minute? I'm just so tired of it being relied on as a storytelling crutch
[2:32:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lee is gonna want that back
[2:32:45] <manoshake> give it to lee
[2:32:46] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat in the other room with the iron
[2:32:48] <nukle0nik> back where you found that other thing you missed
[2:32:48] <JayEarly> @krozbones that is devious
[2:32:51] <theKingRamses> in that room you thought you got the thing you missed
[2:33:00] <+Zxtole> Sure do love idiots posting paragraphs over and over
[2:33:02] <borous> please stop telling pat everything
[2:33:04] <Ropcord> streamer you missed a tinted rock
[2:33:07] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory They're literally codecs that are optional and missable, it's not the core of the storytelling calm your tits
[2:33:11] <artoflec> I don't mind reading lore if its written well but i feel you need to have done enough within the game to make you want to read a dialogue dump of anything elaSmile
[2:33:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Hm
[2:33:12] <mikash81> The story here some Dragon Age / S.T.A.L.K.E.R. sorta thing? Humanity mind poisoning heaven / the mentalsphere?
[2:33:15] <zv1neda> @angriestpat estus will always be a full heal but if you're bleeding it'll only heal 50% of what it would
[2:33:16] <borous> give him a chance to think about items he finds
[2:33:17] <+Cardz_> :)
[2:33:17] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory most lower budjet games are either all text or none, what are you TALKING about
[2:33:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Dunno how I feel about opening a chest and then items just falling out like that
[2:33:21] <FirearmsInstructor> So scrap is currency and iron is upgrade material??
[2:33:23] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami How could you possibly know that it's just optional flavor text if you don't stop to read it in the first place
[2:33:23] <nukle0nik> can you break barrels?
[2:33:26] <Crushter> @mikash81 it's Half Life
[2:33:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[2:33:27] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean I know Diablo does it but
[2:33:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Can you smash the barrels?
[2:33:37] <%aishman> Weapons are unique, you will get a bunch of weapon mods though
[2:33:43] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory CAUSE YOU CHOOSE WHEN TO READ IT
[2:33:43] <Crushter> humans did some dumb shit
[2:33:50] <%aishman> Which does change how the weapons look like
[2:33:52] <+krozbones> The Coach Gun feels so good
[2:33:53] <%arcaderabbit48> @TheNewZealandStory You just pointed out they were low budget and indie though? That's usually why it has to be in a readable form, they dont have the time, money, or manpower for anything else?
[2:33:56] <stolando_florida> Weapons and gear are unique and it's not like borderlands where you have to sort through 40 of the same looking gun to find which one's better
[2:33:59] <zv1neda> humans always do dumb shit
[2:34:00] <Picia000123> D:
[2:34:00] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory You sound like you've never played a video game before in your life.
[2:34:00] <%worldbrand> im not as peeved as that guy but i dont like the trend either. i'd much rather show-don't-tell
[2:34:04] <+Rezca> DANGER
[2:34:04] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT. OPTIONAL
[2:34:05] <Crushter> aw yeah that looks cursed
[2:34:05] <nukle0nik> break it
[2:34:05] <+Nomicro4u> touch it
[2:34:05] <zv1neda> PogChamp
[2:34:05] <energywarning> touch it
[2:34:06] <californaya> Neat
[2:34:06] <+DangerMan83> looks friendly
[2:34:07] <@SSaryn> Would recommend against doing anjything with that.
[2:34:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Well
[2:34:08] <Ropcord> monkaS
[2:34:09] <cosmicdischarge> hit it
[2:34:09] <gigacanuck> kill it
[2:34:10] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami Being able to choose when to read it has no bearing on the content of the text though
[2:34:11] <VJdarkworld> call the doom slayer D:
[2:34:11] <%Doruben> destroy it
[2:34:12] <%Ynkubus18> lick. it.

[2:34:13] <+Cardz_> kiss it
[2:34:13] <+Delror> smash it coward
[2:34:13] <+dirtyh4rr1> PUT YOUR PENIS IN IT
[2:34:15] <rosemon5001> lick it
[2:34:15] <JayEarly> that’s a satisfying looking shotgun
[2:34:15] <exploitativity2> USE A TORCH ON IT
[2:34:16] <%ItsRatman> p-p-put your dick in it
[2:34:16] <manoshake> hit it
[2:34:16] <%aishman> SHOOT IT
[2:34:16] <+KingOfTheGeats> lets go
[2:34:16] <star_feline> That's some DOOM shit
[2:34:21] <manoshake> shoot it
[2:34:21] <ssks123> break it
[2:34:22] <theKingRamses> christmas decoration
[2:34:24] <RupanSen> eh
[2:34:24] <rytisone> stick your dick into it
[2:34:24] <Crushter> bust that shit
[2:34:25] <%Arxel1> Hit it VERY HARD
[2:34:26] <gigacanuck> gore nest
[2:34:27] <Sundz15> Slap it
[2:34:27] <JayEarly> talk to it?
[2:34:28] <captainnathaniel> that is sum heresy
[2:34:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mikash81 Maybe. I think it might be going towards, every single world/reality is the product of a dreamer in another one. When a dreamer dies, you get some flavor of reality fuck.
[2:34:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Its a sexy evil shrine is what it is. Rub your dick on it!
[2:34:31] <+Nomicro4u> IT HATES IT

[2:34:36] <+Cardz_> OH\
[2:34:36] <artoflec> Yeah its either you get no story or you get a badly written one, which im fine with skipping out on it LUL
[2:34:37] <Twerknadooo> Just joined, how many times have people asked why you're playing as Plague?
[2:34:39] <Crushter> SHAMBLER TIME
[2:34:39] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory it does when you judge the entire GAME on it
[2:34:40] <RantingRavager> THE FURRIES
[2:34:40] <exploitativity2> THE SHAMBLEEER
[2:34:42] <%keyworthe> YOU WOKE UP SHROUD
[2:34:43] <%ItsRatman> CS GO LEGEND SHROUD
[2:34:44] <+Cardz_> LUL
[2:34:44] <+smevvster> Dark Souls also hides all of it's lore in missable walls of texts :thinking:

[2:35:43] <californaya> so is this just Gears controls
[2:35:43] <Ner234> MORTIS
[2:35:46] <theKingRamses> ok yeah this game looks neat
[2:35:48] <BionicPulga> foofigGlare
[2:35:49] <nukle0nik> lol a nietsche quote
[2:35:49] <gigacanuck> was that a minigun?
[2:35:49] <+allups> tht is an elite boss type
[2:35:50] <Crushter> looks like an hmg boy
[2:35:52] <xeros720> gears enemies too
[2:35:53] <+aivalera> Rip
[2:35:54] <gigacanuck> I think that was a minigun
[2:35:54] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami It being technically option doesn't mean it's not required to understand the story. You have no way of knowing whether the information is necessary till you stop to fucking read the shit
[2:35:54] <+Nomicro4u> Pet Elmo to relieve stress
[2:35:57] <%Who_lio42> its a JJ
[2:35:57] <+radpuffin> thaty was a heavy
[2:35:57] <$valriot> THE BABY
[2:35:58] <+GenesisKnight> that was a big ol boi
[2:35:59] <+allups> enemy type*
[2:36:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gears of stranger souls

[2:36:06] <xeros720> just push all your stress into Elmo
[2:36:06] <californaya> eh
[2:36:06] <captainnathaniel> you just got ambushed by a boss and by a elite mob
[2:36:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> wat is that thing I am going to walk toward it!!
[2:36:10] <+Cardz_> Whats with these paragraphs
[2:36:12] <star_feline> BIG hero pose
[2:36:13] <+aivalera> You are dead? Really? Resident evil much?
[2:36:14] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Dark Souls is lauded for it's story presentation and it's also hidden behind wall of text
[2:36:20] <+Delror> you dont lose anythign when you die
[2:36:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Dying seems to be of no real consequence
[2:36:21] <+DangerMan83> Yeah you dont lose anything but time
[2:36:22] <Ropcord> you don't lose anything when you die
[2:36:27] <gigacanuck> @Cardz_ dipshits gonna dipshit
[2:36:28] <FirearmsInstructor> ROFL that's one hell of a trigger guard on an uzi
[2:36:29] <manoshake> @angriestpat buy the fire mod for the smg
[2:36:30] <+krozbones> I'm pretty down with that.
[2:36:30] <xeros720> oh cool, nice to not have to worry about death penalties
[2:36:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU LOSE NOTHING! GOOD DAY SIR!
[2:36:38] <star_feline> Your character seems to like to whine a lo
[2:36:39] <+Nomicro4u> you lost all your souls though
[2:36:41] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster I don't care.
[2:36:46] <Crushter> I assume the miniboss is gone though @Ropcord
[2:36:51] <+Sindellah> McCabe
[2:36:52] <%aishman> From the crafter store
[2:36:53] <xeros720> you assume we had souls to begin with
[2:36:56] <aeonicvector> Angry lady
[2:36:57] <RupanSen> so there's no retrieval mechanic in this game?
[2:36:58] <+DangerMan83> it costs like 700 doesnt it?
[2:36:59] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @smevvster no but I dont like it so its bad and a storytelling crutch- that guy probably
[2:36:59] <energywarning> spit hot fire
[2:37:00] <%GarbageNirvana> There's only been so many guys you could buy things from
[2:37:02] <+gatoralus> from the lady next to the upgrade guy
[2:37:02] <%aishman> You can buy all armorr/mods
[2:37:02] <manoshake> rude lady
[2:37:03] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Then this is a "You" problem and has no bearing on any level of objective quality.
[2:37:05] <SeikanTekka> Hi Pat, hi chat
[2:37:06] <AnIrishPapaya> That mini boss is a one and done
[2:37:07] <justaguy3> you dont lose nothin when you die btw pat
[2:37:09] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Critical hitbox seems to be low center mass on the little ball gremlins
[2:37:10] <+Jiziason> @RupanSen nope
[2:37:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SeikanTekka hello
[2:37:18] <%keyworthe> how is it roguelike?
[2:37:18] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory there's a LOT OF text for each and every character in Hollow, even shit enemies, just so you can understand the world better. doesn't that ristle your jimmies?
[2:37:19] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster I am entirely fed up with Dark Souls story presentation, and games that take after it
[2:37:21] <AnIrishPapaya> Since he did he lost his chance this runthrough
[2:37:21] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> diablo is a good comparrison
[2:37:24] <+Nomicro4u> Roablo
[2:37:24] <aeonicvector> somewhere between diablo, souls, and like 6 other franchises
[2:37:25] <+Rezca> Diablo is more schlooter though
[2:37:26] <AnIrishPapaya> died*
[2:37:26] <%Shonen_hero> This game looks fucking cool
[2:37:27] <Ragnakawaii> Hello
[2:37:29] <+TehBeerBaron> Not really
[2:37:29] <stolando_florida> @FirearmsInstructor woah no way the guys that are low to the floor have a low hitbox?
[2:37:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Like a co-op RE Diablo
[2:37:30] <Scyllas> Anthem Souls
[2:37:31] <star_feline> CoolCat BABY
[2:37:32] <+allups> diablo but shooting and in a cool world
[2:37:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Wait, roguelike? Didn't you die?
[2:37:36] <%Shonen_hero> It fits my aesthetic
[2:37:36] <MrGreenToS> You can tab from craft to buy from her menu
[2:37:36] <xeros720> a slower warframe
[2:37:39] <+Nomicro4u> Soulablro
[2:37:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Scyllas but good
[2:37:40] <Vyneci> How can this be diablo-ish if the camera isn't up high though? Kappa
[2:37:41] <%arcaderabbit48> Its Diablo, but without the loot? So yeah, multiplayer is probably really good for this
[2:37:43] <+Delror> @TheNewZealandStory then you don't have to play them, man. let people like what they want to like
[2:37:44] <gigacanuck> @aeonicvector so it's not really like anything
[2:37:47] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory So you're mad that there is a story to read
[2:37:48] <Jolnir> minecraft souls
[2:37:48] <RupanSen> souls gunplay?
[2:37:48] <EatMyVordts> The game is a different beast singleplayer and coop
[2:37:50] <%Calliphor> Sounds of War?
[2:37:52] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @TheNewZealandStory its okay to not like things other people do, the problem is when you wont shut up about it
[2:37:54] <+radpuffin> gears of rogue
[2:37:54] <fazoburquina> anthem souls LUL
[2:37:54] <$spacehouse> @angriestpat you can get hurt while knocked down, bware of that
[2:37:56] <%Calliphor> err, Souls of War
[2:37:58] <T_Sasquatch> its dark souls with guns Kappa
[2:37:59] <Cendov> Talk to reg again
[2:38:00] <energywarning> BAHNING
[2:38:01] <+allups> cmon man Anthem was a cool idea
[2:38:02] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat more like diablo and hellgate London
[2:38:06] <aeonicvector> @gigacanuck it is and it isnt, youll see
[2:38:07] <+Rezca> Sell at the other two merchants
[2:38:10] <+TheNewZealandStory> @Delror I'm not stopping anyone. I just think it's shit
[2:38:11] <rytisone> Souls of Souls
[2:38:15] <+DangerMan83> Its Gears of war dark souls in chalice dungeons
[2:38:19] <%Cthulos> Vanquish: Gears of Souls (No slide, bitch!)
[2:38:19] <xeros720> i'd really say it's more standard 3rd person shootbangs, but it borrows a lot of souls mechanics
[2:38:26] <californaya> It was the best of times, it was the Dark Souls of times.
[2:38:26] <star_feline> I don't get the decision to have SOULS music in a 1960s apocalypse hell hole
[2:38:28] <Storm_Samurai> Is this just Dark Souls with guns?
[2:38:28] <StromkoPenguin> Well, Diablo 3's looting was mostly to scrap things for parts to craft / upgrade the crap you actually wanted, so that's very similar to this
[2:38:39] <%Evan2Echoes> oh man no, you'll need those ammo boxes
[2:38:41] <artoflec> i dunno, dark souls is an extreme but sometimes you can get reflections of lore in the environment. On the other extreme is GOW2018 where nobody shuts up and no line of dialogue is memorable or interesting.
[2:38:43] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory a bigger problem when you don't understand why it's a thing, and that you don't even need it
[2:38:47] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory You're conflating "I dont like thing" with "thing is bad"
[2:38:48] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Interesting choice, selling the ammo box
[2:38:49] <%Arazien> Today's entry of Hoes Mad" is @TheNewZealandStory
[2:38:50] <gigacanuck> inb4 ammo bow was most important consumable
[2:38:51] <exploitativity2> god these NPCs are pissy
[2:38:51] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> brave move
[2:38:53] <KaliasTV> Ammo - unnecessary
[2:38:58] <+TheNewZealandStory> @heckubrickyillneverdie I'm only replying to people. I only made one statement about how I hated the computer terminals
[2:39:00] <+Technores> music is like this cuz chronos had this music
[2:39:02] <+floralkami> @smevvster thank you
[2:39:13] <aero160h> the game is generous with resources. don't ever sell any items. ammo box is the most important thing for boss fights
[2:39:22] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> lol
[2:39:23] <exploitativity2> well thinking something is bad is an opinion
[2:39:25] <@SSaryn> Ammo Box is literally only for emergencies.
[2:39:25] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster I don't like the thing because it's bad.
[2:39:29] <captainnathaniel> @exploitativity2 just the tsun girl looks pissed
[2:39:29] <Jolnir> is the tutorial over?
[2:39:30] <xeros720> ammo refill during bosses?
[2:39:30] <%Evan2Echoes> They do give you enough. By giving you Ammo Boxersd
[2:39:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> hahahahaha
[2:39:32] <justaguy3> yeaah ammo boxes are the most important. youll run out of amo on boss fights
[2:39:34] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Well yeah they kinda do but Ammo Box helps in boss fights
[2:39:35] <gigacanuck> Pat, what do you think those ammo boxes were?
[2:39:35] <nuane> did he just start?
[2:39:36] <+Cardz_> They wouldnt break the law or theyd go to jail
[2:39:37] <aeonicvector> no? ive had maybe3 bosses where i ran out, and thats cause im refusing to go above my current gear
[2:39:37] <Sundz15> In endgame yes
[2:39:39] <EatMyVordts> There's like 3 bosses that require it almost.
[2:39:39] <+gatoralus> later on its just useful so you don't have to pick up ammo, but they want to fix that
[2:39:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Enough ammo might mean meleeing adds
[2:39:41] <exploitativity2> @captainnathaniel I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR A CHAT
[2:39:41] <Ericgi231> On hard mode, they do not give you enough ammo. I usually have enough ammo for half of the bosses health.
[2:39:41] <star_feline> No shit sherlock
[2:39:43] <%Niney_Who> Ammo boxes are what I hate.
[2:39:46] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory no, you said that the game having long passages to read to get more story is why you think the game is bad.
[2:39:46] <Jolnir> this seems like playing l4d solo
[2:39:49] <+RocketAttila> I rarely used ammo boxes but I think it was because I had an OP shotgun or something at the start of the game.
[2:39:51] <MrGreenToS> So far I’m rocking 55 ammo boxes and 70 bloodviles
[2:39:58] <a_mad_dragon> he's playing solo, he won't need as much ammo for boss fights
[2:39:59] <gigacanuck> and?
[2:40:02] <gigacanuck> oh no
[2:40:11] <gigacanuck> he's not piecing it together
[2:40:15] <manoshake> @angriestpat ammo boxes is mostly for bosses
[2:40:15] <%Dakuu75> this game looks neat, never seen it till now.
[2:40:15] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I never said the game was bad, I said I should avoid the game
[2:40:15] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory But there are thousands of literate individuals that enjoy reading, unlike your American ass.
[2:40:16] <+Rezca> Yeah... you need like 2 ammo bosses when you coop
[2:40:16] <SeshohoCian> ammo box is a consumable that refreshes your ammo
[2:40:20] <+RocketAttila> then again I am stupid at video games and keep saying "i dont need this item yet:
[2:40:20] <%arcaderabbit48> Schroedinger's Ammo! They're for whatever gun you happen to be holding when you open it! I assume
[2:40:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> I see by giving you a gun, they fucked up as it were
[2:40:23] <$spacehouse> Lots of bosses are tuned for group's I hear
[2:40:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat doesn't like consumables, remember
[2:40:24] <SeshohoCian> right?
[2:40:28] <DantesAnimus> these levels designs remind me a little bit of Let It Die
[2:40:30] <+krozbones> There's really only a few stretches where I felt strained on ammo and there was a checkpoint before it mattered each time.
[2:40:33] <justaguy3> ammo boxes full refresh your ammo
[2:40:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> pat is gonna run out and go "But how could this happen
[2:40:41] <+krozbones> Now in coop where ammo drops aren't shared? I like them a lot
[2:40:47] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory "I don't like the thing because it is bad" --you to another commentor
[2:40:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> He sold 1 ammo box, guys, come on
[2:40:52] <%Lizard0TM> ammo boxes are purely for boss fights, because you WILL RUN OUT OF AMMO NO MATTER WHAT
[2:40:56] <a_mad_dragon> crayup
[2:40:57] <stolando_florida> Run right into the business end of my axe little dudes thank you
[2:41:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> I assume some bosses will take so much ammo, and your only choice is boxes or using melee on adds until they drop some.
[2:41:03] <artoflec> im literate i just think most of the lore written in these types of games is bad and never has any follow through in the world
[2:41:04] <%Arazien> @TheNewZealandStory You literally just said "I don't like the thing because it's bad.", so don't try and pull the "I never said the game was bad"
[2:41:04] <%radda343> nothing quite like a eurojank game on stream and a pissbaby in chat that doesn't like reading for some reason
[2:41:11] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster I enjoy reading though, just not wikipedia entries of dry text placed every couple minutes in what is ostensibly an action game
[2:41:11] <%arcaderabbit48> Pat finally worked up the courage to sell a consumable item and ya'll are jumping down his throat for it
[2:41:12] <%radda343> I am sports entertained
[2:41:14] <JayEarly> @angriestpat what if this game subverts your expectations like the Last Jedi and doesn’t give you enough ammo
[2:41:18] <Crushter> it makes the brain hurt when u have to read
[2:41:19] <+Rezca> Enemies can hurt each other, its sometimes fun to do
[2:41:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> FULL ENEMY FRIENDLY FIRE
[2:41:20] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Yeah there's Friendly Fire in this game for both sides.
[2:41:21] <stolando_florida> I wish I could mute people like newzealand lol
[2:41:26] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory read a boog
[2:41:27] <aeonicvector> almost all enemy non-melee attacks can freindly fire
[2:41:33] <gigacanuck> ugh, subverting expectations
[2:41:33] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory But you DON'T have to read it
[2:41:42] <+TheNewZealandStory> @Arazien saying something in a game is bad is not saying that the game is bad.
[2:41:43] <%GarbageNirvana> Would y'all shut up about the computers already, goddamn
[2:41:50] <gigacanuck> I EXPECT YOU TO MAKE A GOOD PRODUCT
[2:41:51] <Ion_Laser> ^
[2:41:51] <%arcaderabbit48> @aishman How bad is the friendly fire? Because this game looks like it would be chaotic in multiplayer
[2:41:52] <StromkoPenguin> @stolando_florida You can, but then you couldn't whine about people whining.
[2:41:53] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory you can CHOOSE to, but you don't HAVE to
[2:41:58] <foreverN2dust> @GarbageNirvana this
[2:41:58] <+Taglog7> DARKWATCH?!
[2:42:04] <star_feline> It's been like half an hour and yall arguing about the computers still LUL
[2:42:04] <nuane> heavy weapons guy
[2:42:05] <$Big_King_Coconut> KonCha
[2:42:09] <artoflec> like, Nioh has a weird problem where you fight a revenant, and then their spirit tells you lore - but it generally just supports what you've already learned from playing through the mission.
[2:42:13] <StromkoPenguin> It's a popular past time in this chat, we're sad people.
[2:42:14] <Skeletonmanners> if you feel you cant beat something you can reroll the world to start from the start with all your stuff
[2:42:15] <captainnathaniel> oh shit, the ease music started
[2:42:16] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami but I have to read it in the first place to know whether I shouldve read it in the first place
[2:42:18] <%arcaderabbit48> We have now been talking about the computer terminals longer than it took Pat to read the computer terminals
[2:42:18] <MarylandJutsu> kill all these evil emlos
[2:42:19] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory the first thing you said was that the game is bad because of the flavot text
[2:42:22] <+krozbones> @TheNewZealandStory On the plus side, I'm a good few hours in and I haven't had but three or four things to read outside of that "lore basement"
[2:42:25] <%Dakuu75> lmao "Darkwatch" man this is an old-as-fuck call-back XD @Taglog7
[2:42:28] <stolando_florida> @AngriestPat while aiming if you click in L3 you can switch the shoulder you're firing from
[2:42:30] <Crushter> use the mod pat
[2:42:31] <+Rezca> I like Nioh's though, they are rather short
[2:42:31] <%radda343> yeah lame it out
[2:42:33] <%radda343> delicious cheese
[2:42:40] <$Big_King_Coconut> @Skeletonmanners thank you I was wondering how that worked
[2:42:44] <%arcaderabbit48> Also, Crystal Tree Minigun is pretty cool
[2:42:44] <justaguy3> OH YEAH btw pat you can change shoulder
[2:42:49] <%radda343> right in the dick
[2:42:50] <+Taglog7> Poooound
[2:42:58] <RupanSen> bech
[2:42:58] <T_Sasquatch> laming it out is what guns are made for
[2:43:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> [complete silence] bitch
[2:43:02] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory NO. YOU DON'T. I didn't even know that text wasa thing cause every other streamer just DIDN'T READ IT
[2:43:05] <artoflec> Nioh's are short and sweet yeah, but with so much rich history they're working with - like the character bios - it owuld have been nice to see that more. There are hints to Yasuke early on which is really cool because then you FIGHT him later.
[2:43:09] <%worldbrand> what a meanie bulli pants
[2:43:16] <+Rezca> ONE SHOT
[2:43:18] <JayEarly> that shotgun has a real nice punch
[2:43:19] <nuane> Nobody: Pat: bitch
[2:43:20] <rytisone> one time try
[2:43:21] <%Swampykins> restart
[2:43:24] <%aishman> ONE SHOT in that instance
[2:43:25] <+Nomicro4u> better luck next time
[2:43:26] <stolando_florida> Don't restart.
[2:43:27] <FirearmsInstructor> One opportunity.
[2:43:28] <gigacanuck> that is a LOT of human bones
[2:43:28] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami the first thing I said was asking whether anything ever actually happens in this game, followed by me saying that these computer terminals make me want to avoid the game
[2:43:28] <%aishman> You'll fight him again later
[2:43:28] <RantingRavager> ONE OPPORTUNITY
[2:43:30] <%arcaderabbit48> Wait, seriously
[2:43:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> One chance
[2:43:31] <+gatoralus> pat don't worry about it
[2:43:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> I've been on a bloodborne kick for a while so when I saw he staggered i was thinking REPOST THAT BITCH
[2:43:37] <+Nomicro4u> MOMS SPAGHETTI
[2:43:37] <$Fistofgraal> You missed your chance to blow
[2:43:40] <Kongro_> Is Pat having a good time?
[2:43:47] <+Technores> reg enemies are static. the captains are random per life
[2:43:49] <%Doruben> its the area boss and destroying the totems helps
[2:43:51] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat dont worry about it, if he's gone you can reroll teh world for him
[2:44:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> Theres furries are furious
[2:44:03] <stolando_florida> He's not gone.
[2:44:06] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I have to read it, otherwise how would I know what it says?
[2:44:08] <%radda343> those things kinda look like the pokemon that pretends to be pikachu
[2:44:09] <%worldbrand> y'all obviously aren't going to change his mind so just ignore him maybe?
[2:44:10] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Wow missable flavour text that's entirely optional what a shit game.
[2:44:11] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory so you walked into a stream, didn't see any action for t minutes and went, THIS IS SHIT
[2:44:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sit and stew in your failure
[2:44:13] <TheVampiricVamp> Is Pat a...PAT?
[2:44:18] <BaslerJones> hello Patrick
[2:44:20] <T_Sasquatch> there was a boss here, its gone now - james
[2:44:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Furries have evolved into their final form
[2:44:35] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory you skim?
[2:44:36] <stolando_florida> Furries final form is sewer gremlins?
[2:44:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Or fight it in someone else's game
[2:44:37] <captainnathaniel> fuzzies
[2:44:50] <StromkoPenguin> Ward 13 was an odd part of this game to be fair. If walking around reading terminals was someone's first impression of the game they would have no idea what it is.
[2:44:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Seriously, could you guys take it to DMs or something if you're gonna keep arguing about the computers
[2:44:55] <tylerpyre> lol get fucked
[2:45:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> The fuzzies evolved into furries and it all went wrong
[2:45:01] <SenketsuKira> dont re roll it will force scale everything to you everytime you do it
[2:45:07] <TheVampiricVamp> Ow Pat punched me
[2:45:09] <+Pookiedaexzile> @captainnathaniel I'm pretty sure its Furries
[2:45:11] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory like, it didn't tell you to go solve any puzzles that will be using the lore, did it?
[2:45:14] <%Doruben> nother one
[2:45:15] <JayEarly> is time convoluted in this universe as well?
[2:45:16] <aeonicvector> @SenketsuKira but never ABOVE you good to note
[2:45:16] <+AllenDeadman> elite
[2:45:18] <+trekkie11041> @AngriestPat those things are making the same noises as necromorphs
[2:45:19] <Ner234> LUL
[2:45:20] <$Big_King_Coconut> friendly fire LUL
[2:45:21] <+gatoralus> those guys are the worst enemies lol
[2:45:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> ...friendly fire isn't
[2:45:23] <star_feline> LMAO get murked
[2:45:24] <Crushter> use the mod you installed @AngriestPat
[2:45:24] <gigacanuck> LUL
[2:45:29] <%Dakuu75> that enemy friendly fire Kreygasm
[2:45:30] <manoshake> use fireshot
[2:45:30] <captainnathaniel> @Pookiedaexzile no, the little guys are called fuzzies
[2:45:33] <%drabberfaun535> why are all the creature yells from dead space 2?
[2:45:36] <Crushter> there ya go
[2:45:37] <+Rezca> man, fireshot is great
[2:45:39] <artoflec> what happens if you touch fuzzies
[2:45:40] <manoshake> melted
[2:45:42] <+Cardz_> nice
[2:45:45] <+gatoralus> hotshot owns so hard lol
[2:45:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you switch / toggle which side you shoot? Toggle down sites on the left side?
[2:45:51] <%arcaderabbit48> Fire seems really solid, hot damn
[2:45:52] <+Nomicro4u> FARTGAS
[2:45:55] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami Yeah, watching someone wander around a basement with nothing happening while reading entire essays every thirty seconds sure wasn't a good first impression
[2:45:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> @captainnathaniel Nah I beat this game twice mate, its furries
[2:45:58] <%worldbrand> I thought that said boot rot
[2:46:04] <+krozbones> Most Root are of the opinion that Fire Bad
[2:46:06] <+Rezca> use the heal mod
[2:46:07] <aeonicvector> you can change side your aiming on with a stick in iirc
[2:46:08] <artoflec> w-what happens if you touch furries 👀
[2:46:08] <Wan6Saber> 💥
[2:46:12] <star_feline> WOW that meter is slow to climb down
[2:46:16] <$Big_King_Coconut> Do good shoot Pat
[2:46:20] <+Nomicro4u> they infect you with their degeneracy
[2:46:21] <californaya> Touch Furry, Get Dizzy
[2:46:25] <Crushter> rematch time
[2:46:25] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory DUDE, IT'S PAT. HE READS
[2:46:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is just the adventures of eli going to the store on tuesday
[2:46:30] <%arcaderabbit48> What is Root Rot?
[2:46:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Right, blocks it is then
[2:46:33] <%omegasis> how's pat liking the game so far?
[2:46:36] <%arcaderabbit48> How do status effects work here?
[2:46:40] <xeros720> Eli Souls
[2:46:41] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami Yeah, what's your point? I read too
[2:46:43] <+Rezca> Root Rot leads to Infected
[2:46:45] <@SSaryn> Yeah, resistances are huge in this game.
[2:46:45] <%worldbrand> Is that the evil miniboss thing?
[2:46:51] <aeonicvector> root rot dosent even decrease unless your positve resist iirc
[2:46:55] <$Big_King_Coconut> @arcaderabbit48 it makes you start coughing, which prevents you from doing anything else
[2:46:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thenewzealandstory I was fucking enthralled by the lore dump that felt like it should have been late game. It's like if you got the AoT basement in season 1.
[2:46:56] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory maybe not judging the whole thing in 5mins would've helped your shit opinion
[2:46:57] <+ImperiusMex> is this pc or console?
[2:46:57] <nuane> does this dude ever shut up? (the character, not Pat)
[2:46:58] <%Zutrax> Infection, which causes you to cough sometimes interrupting actions
[2:47:00] <aeonicvector> also root rot makes you have asthma in game
[2:47:07] <@SSaryn> And Root Rot is just your Infected status, it's coughing.
[2:47:11] <%aishman> @AngriestPat If Root Rot gets fulled, it means you're infected, making you cough rather than doing any actions.
[2:47:12] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory patience is a virtue
[2:47:17] <%aishman> Yeah like @SSaryn said.
[2:47:20] <%arcaderabbit48> @Big_King_Coconut Is this a Dark Souls style "meter fills and you are effected" kinda deal?
[2:47:20] <+Nomicro4u> INVADER SHROOD
[2:47:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Root rot = infection = coughing
[2:47:28] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I didn't judge the whole thing, I judged the part I saw
[2:47:28] <$Big_King_Coconut> @arcaderabbit48 exactly
[2:47:33] <%Doruben> behind you
[2:47:37] <%BestTeaMaker> bossfight
[2:47:38] <%Niney_Who> I hear footsteps
[2:47:40] <+Cardz_> Shroud got tired of killing people in game and now he kills people for sport
[2:47:43] <+xddddsorandom> Man I love Shroud he plays the twtich games
[2:47:44] <%GarbageNirvana> What exactly does root rot do?
[2:47:44] <+Nomicro4u> train noises
[2:47:46] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory obviously you only read as much to survive day to day
[2:47:49] <tanarath> what is this, souls shooter?
[2:47:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> And so it begins
[2:47:55] <rytisone> gangbanged no matter what
[2:47:55] <%arcaderabbit48> @Big_King_Coconut Okay, that's not too bad
[2:48:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> Is Pat a casual or a leet pro gamer
[2:48:03] <%Doruben> ENCOUNTER CLEARED
[2:48:05] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory "I should stay aay from this game"
[2:48:05] <JayEarly> big booty root rot party
[2:48:07] <star_feline> Be careful of alien Heavy Weapons Guy
[2:48:07] <%arcaderabbit48> Really not a fan of adds for a fight liek this
[2:48:10] <Crushter> yo he's got gas grenades
[2:48:13] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory But you said you'd avoid the whole game because of the party you saw, thus you judged the whole thing.
[2:48:19] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory because someone took time to read
[2:48:20] <+Rezca> Shoot it
[2:48:20] <%Doruben> thats not shrtoud
[2:48:21] <Zebroneath> Is there difficulty scaling in co-op?
[2:48:24] <T_Sasquatch> is there dodge invincibility ?
[2:48:28] <%Lizard0TM> yes
[2:48:28] <%Niney_Who> Boss Left
[2:48:28] <nuane> i'm the boss
[2:48:30] <@SSaryn> Nah, miniboss left.
[2:48:30] <aeonicvector> boss ran
[2:48:30] <%aishman> The boss ran away.
[2:48:33] <Crushter> boss ran
[2:48:35] <manoshake> it is the boss
[2:48:39] <Crushter> health bar's gone
[2:48:40] <%worldbrand> Wow those things last for a while
[2:48:42] <+RocketAttila> @Zebroneath from what I have heard it scales to the highest level player in the lobby
[2:48:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Boss ran away
[2:48:43] <+Nomicro4u> NS
[2:48:43] <manoshake> you will encounter it later
[2:48:45] <masterfire23> he said no and left LUL
[2:48:47] <borous> this is a special spawn
[2:48:47] <+TheSaintJohn> bosses will have on on-screen health bar
[2:48:49] <%MonsieurHedge> @Zebroneath yeah, with 3 people it's pretty much a morde shooter
[2:48:49] <star_feline> Oh fuck it's fricking Pokemon mechanics LUL
[2:48:50] <%aishman> The boss left dude.
[2:48:52] <borous> you fought one earlier
[2:48:52] <aeonicvector> boss flees
[2:49:00] <SpaceGuntank> it ran away
[2:49:05] <@SSaryn> Literally just leaves. I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you what it does.
[2:49:06] <%worldbrand> Be wary of fart gas
[2:49:07] <%Niney_Who> Ran away like a coward
[2:49:15] <borous> boss peaces out at like 50% HP
[2:49:16] <Crushter> supposedly the totem destruction makes your life easier in the fight
[2:49:18] <Mister_McDerp> coward boss
[2:49:19] <$Big_King_Coconut> Big Cowardice
[2:49:20] <%Dakuu75> that root-rot icon is a skull... might be isnta-death, idk
[2:49:20] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami The game does something I hate, seems like a good enough reason to avoid it to me
[2:49:20] <+Rezca> Heal mod
[2:49:21] <aeonicvector> use r1 to heal
[2:49:22] <a_mad_dragon> use your heal aura
[2:49:22] <cosmicdischarge> is this the new pokemon ?
[2:49:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Are we fighting Pat?
[2:49:26] <%arcaderabbit48> So, you summon the boss, it fights you, but then it leaves if you die but it also leaves if you dont? Why bother summoning it then?
[2:49:26] <stolando_florida> Might as well use your healing mechanic on your mod
[2:49:31] <%Dementedpenguin> I mean, he should forfeit his title of "boss" if he ran. >_>
[2:49:31] <+GenesisKnight> Don't forget your health mod
[2:49:32] <%Bane_Kaikyo> that's kinda bullshit?...
[2:49:32] <a_mad_dragon> USE THE SHOTGUN HEAL
[2:49:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> You have a free heal aura!
[2:49:44] <aeonicvector> >using consumables over abilities
[2:49:44] <Crushter> its the area boss defending its territory, I imagine
[2:49:51] <star_feline> @Dementedpenguin He's more middle management tbh
[2:49:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, Shotgun heal
[2:50:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> USE YOUR MODS
[2:50:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @aeonicvector Im so proud!
[2:50:01] <%arcaderabbit48> Does damage you do to it now carry over?
[2:50:07] <aeonicvector> lmao
[2:50:07] <xeros720> we in there
[2:50:07] <SeikanTekka> Go hunt that monst... I mean boss
[2:50:09] <Crushter> no I think it heals
[2:50:11] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster the game is $40 and I had no real interest in it in the first place. doing one thing I hate is enough of a reason to avoid it
[2:50:19] <rytisone> so the most common enemy is just a flood from halo, I see
[2:50:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is Root Rot like petrify?
[2:50:23] <%Dakuu75> any grenad-o's?
[2:50:24] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory you must not like a lot of things...
[2:50:25] <%raios22> raios22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[2:50:29] <Crushter> aussies hate reading
[2:50:30] <%worldbrand> i can't decide whether that chest was goofy or charming
[2:50:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Use your Shotgun alt to heal
[2:50:33] <%Niney_Who> you have shotgun heal if you need it
[2:50:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, why are you wasting your time trying to convince this person to buy a game they don't want?
[2:50:43] <Zedkan> twtich streamer shroud is the boss
[2:50:46] <star_feline> Yeah hit him with that DPS shit
[2:50:47] <Crushter> so bosses summon adds
[2:50:47] <%Niney_Who> Boss ran again
[2:50:48] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Imagine being so poor you need to avoid a 40 dollar game for making you read
[2:50:52] <+AllenDeadman> elite incoming
[2:50:52] <Crushter> with a sound que
[2:50:52] <%Doruben> ran away
[2:50:53] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I don't like a lot of things. I'm very picky and have high standards.
[2:50:56] <%Lizard0TM> root rot is literally like poison
[2:51:01] <+allups> heavy attacks might stun her
[2:51:02] <%Dakuu75> what is this shooter-souls-born shit, lol. this game looks rad
[2:51:03] <%Lizard0TM> but makes you cough too
[2:51:03] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory but to call it bad because of story, is a shit opinion i hope others won't follow
[2:51:07] <nuane> @CappuccinoGuil i'm a gorilla marketer
[2:51:10] <T_Sasquatch> @smevvster dont make fun of poor people you dick
[2:51:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> @nuane you mean guerilla?
[2:51:17] <%Klownkommander> Klownkommander subscribed at Tier 1.

[2:51:25] <star_feline> I like how Pat sighs when the character sighs
[2:51:29] <+smevvster> @T_Sasquatch I'm making fun of an ass this is different.
[2:51:30] <Crushter> shotgun heal mod is good stuff
[2:51:34] <%Wallabri> so...... good game?
[2:51:38] <nuane> @CappuccinoGuil I know what I said
[2:51:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Rub his bag
[2:51:41] <%Estuko> I was just playing this game, goodstufff!!!
[2:51:42] <$Big_King_Coconut> good game
[2:51:43] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory ............ okay, starting to smell like bitch in here....
[2:51:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cappuccinoguil It's not that. His opinions are bad and he should feel bad.
[2:51:45] <aeonicvector> is good game, but def play co-op if you can
[2:51:46] <Mister_McDerp> gorilla?
[2:51:46] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster Why would anyone spend $40 that they're mostly indifferent to aside from doing something they outright hate?
[2:51:47] <MarylandJutsu> Emlo likes the VIBBEO GAME
[2:51:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat THat's NOT how cats work! D:
[2:51:49] <Scyllas> Boss is laming out Pat
[2:51:50] <sambws> lol chat is heated today
[2:51:54] <%Dakuu75> looks better than code vein
[2:51:55] <tanarath> Rub the bag for luck
[2:51:55] <justaguy3> wassuh estuko
[2:52:00] <%Estuko> @justaguy3 hihi
[2:52:02] <Crushter> imagine hating optional reading
[2:52:02] <%worldbrand> being picky doesn't mean you have high standards. i can't believe this is still going on. i'm just going to mute the whole thing.
[2:52:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie on monday: So Its like If I played a Fighting game againist waves of enemies"
[2:52:04] <+griffball13> now that is some bloom
[2:52:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> MODERN DAY?!
[2:52:06] <+HelloImTom08> he made it
[2:52:06] <%Doruben> next area and checkpoint
[2:52:06] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Because your average human with a brain doesnt have a violent physical reaction when confronted with reading
[2:52:07] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory do you hate shooting games?
[2:52:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> @GeneralSCPatton it's literally a videogame. You can just... not waste your time
[2:52:15] <+Rezca> Now to have some fun
[2:52:18] <justaguy3> oh yeah btw pat sorry for spamming
[2:52:19] <gigacanuck> @TheNewZealandStory you never got invited to anyone's birthday as kid, did you?
[2:52:22] <%Niney_Who> Is chat still having a bitchfit over reading or something
[2:52:23] <%Niney_Who> apatWhat
[2:52:36] <%Estuko> This game is super fun, @AngriestPat I'm positive you're gonna enjoy this game.
[2:52:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Niney_Who yup. It's starting to get real annoying
[2:52:42] <%Klownkommander> Oof the chat is salty af today
[2:52:44] <%Dakuu75> remember when everyone called these things "save points" instead of "bonfires" ?
[2:52:45] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I didn't call it bad because of story. My whole complaint is about the fucking concentrated lore dump in one spot
[2:52:45] <Ragnakawaii> So whats the story of this so far
[2:52:45] <nukle0nik> did you give the ring to that guy?
[2:52:52] <%TheGreatPenor> Is this like a supernatural survival game
[2:52:54] <+Nomicro4u> baby song
[2:52:55] <$Big_King_Coconut> Good song
[2:52:55] <ShichiNoBushi> It's almost iron-ic.
[2:52:57] <+gatoralus> @Estuko agreed really good game
[2:52:58] <nuane> bars
[2:52:59] <xeros720> Pat could use a lyrics writer
[2:53:01] <Ion_Laser> It's good shit
[2:53:04] <BlindGato> LEE RING
[2:53:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lee wants his ring back
[2:53:08] <aeonicvector> Yes, leaving lore in a relevant spot = BAD didnt you know Kappa
[2:53:08] <FeelinNifty> it got vod muted
[2:53:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @niney_who piss baby bitch fitz are half the reason I come here
[2:53:10] <gigacanuck> Lee ring?
[2:53:13] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory so, you don't like reading. something i asked a while back
[2:53:15] <captainnathaniel> @TheNewZealandStory thats literally the only place that has that
[2:53:17] <+krozbones> @Ragnakawaii 1960's science went to far and merged some dimensions, the world is boned and people are trying their best not to die
[2:53:23] <%Estuko> @Ragnakawaii cosmic enemy reached earth, Flood/Eldritch kinda deal.
[2:53:24] <%Calek> I've been reading the same argument for like an hour, why is it still going
[2:53:32] <TheVampiricVamp> Eeh, just be, Anytime
[2:53:34] <Cendov> Lee has some new dialogue
[2:53:40] <Ragnakawaii> ah okay
[2:53:44] <Ragnakawaii> thanks
[2:53:48] <JayEarly> this music reminds me of the first area in DD
[2:53:50] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I like reading. I don't like reading paragraphs and paragraphs of text in an action game.
[2:54:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Question: are there bigger chunks for upgrades or is it all just Iron?
[2:54:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Perfectly balanced as all things should be
[2:54:11] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat how do the controls feel to you?
[2:54:14] <%Calek> there's bigger chunks
[2:54:15] <stolando_florida> @CappuccinoGuil there's bigger iron bits
[2:54:17] <tusk102> Yaaay, first time actually catching a stream of pat. Sometimes I catch paige but not our good ol dwarf man.
[2:54:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @calek Isn't it amazing when these npcs have more dialog variety than the people arguing in chat?
[2:54:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @stolando_florida gotcha
[2:54:20] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Then we're back to "you don't like thing", not "thing is bad"
[2:54:25] <aero160h> hey Pat did you get the armor set in the founders hideout by breaking the bookshelf in there?
[2:54:31] <%Dakuu75> not a fan of these weapons that literally look like trash, super glued together lol
[2:54:33] <gigacanuck> *ILLITERACY ALERT*
[2:54:34] <+Captain_Bear_Mode> Hi Lee, tell me about clementine monkaS
[2:54:35] <+griffball13> what does that mean
[2:54:35] <nukle0nik> old as teeth?
[2:54:42] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory then skip it. youre having a bad time right now
[2:54:42] <%Niney_Who> OPINONS are SUBJECTIVE
[2:54:45] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I'm indifferent to shooting games. It depends of what the game does in particular
[2:54:46] <%Niney_Who> NotLikeThis
[2:54:48] <%Estuko> @CommanderSqueaks This game even has rewards or consequences from various conversational decisions LUL
[2:54:48] <%Bailey__gaming> so whats the verdict so far?

[2:55:34] <%worldbrand> @CappuccinoGuil cut out the middle man and just hang us all
[2:55:36] <star_feline> @CappuccinoGuil No fair D:
[2:55:38] <%Estuko> @CommanderSqueaks don't think so, but I wanna watch what he does lol
[2:55:41] <%Dakuu75> oh, this game has co-op, neat.
[2:55:42] <T_Sasquatch> guys , the MUTE function EXISTS
[2:55:42] <zv1neda> TSUN TSUN
[2:55:43] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory okay, you're alergic to reading in video games, we get it
[2:55:44] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster but I like visual novels when I have the time for them
[2:55:44] <aero160h> oh okay, couldn't see it that well.
[2:55:47] <%TheGreatPenor> TheGreatPenor subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Keep up. Work good. Like much.
[2:55:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gee, it sure is incredible that not everyone likes the same things, eh chat? :)
[2:55:58] <+griffball13> would he be considered a magic black man trope?
[2:56:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> Ol Reggie
[2:56:00] <gigacanuck> @T_Sasquatch but it's fun to see people's horrible opinions
[2:56:14] <%Niney_Who> All the fucking Prime people are fighting, stop it apatDab
[2:56:17] <%Estuko> @CommanderSqueaks I mean, unless he asks specifically I wanna see what mess occurs. I learned the game can be different such as almost getting killed in the reactor part lol
[2:56:20] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory I'm amazed you survived to this day.
[2:56:25] <JayEarly> I’m a fan of the guns looking like junk glued together, reminds me of Metro
[2:56:39] <foreverN2dust> Married
[2:56:40] <%worldbrand> Is that stockpile thomas?
[2:56:42] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster Because I don't like reading essays of text in an action game?
[2:56:49] <star_feline> @griffball13 More like wise old black guy with experience
[2:56:49] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Oh, but I guess if you just skip all the text and look at the pretty pictures, I guess even you could get through a VN.
[2:56:57] <$Big_King_Coconut> darling francis?
[2:56:58] <%Estuko> Like I DIDN'T GET THIS oh man I super missed this NotLikeThis
[2:56:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> I love that we all call him Lee instead of Reggie. That man left a mark in our hearts. RIP

[2:57:59] <aeonicvector> you didnt
[2:58:02] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster But I'm mostly just shitposting too
[2:58:04] <@SSaryn> You probably didn't.
[2:58:06] <+griffball13> free money
[2:58:06] <aeonicvector> chats not knowing what they want
[2:58:08] <%MonsieurHedge> yeah thats some bullshit, theres no armor set from this
[2:58:09] <%dalmek> "You have a heart of gold. Don't let them take it from you"
[2:58:16] <nukle0nik> you had a point more
[2:58:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dragon4234 Are you thinking of the bandit set? That's from the pocket watch.
[2:58:20] <+AllenDeadman> oh scarvenger perk
[2:58:23] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory "it's a prank, bro"
[2:58:24] <%Estuko> @smevvster just block/mute him if it bothers you tbh, prevents a lot messy stuff
[2:58:24] <+Dragon4234> Yeah my b
[2:58:25] <a_mad_dragon> you still have a point
[2:58:33] <cosmicdischarge> Max elder @AngriestPat

[2:58:40] <@lewdskeletor13> Kill them all Pat
[2:58:41] <%Estuko> @smevvster wasn't hear earlier for whatever was going on, but I prob would've done it lol
[2:58:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Seems like any game where you have a perk that gives you an XP boost is basically saying "You're an idiot if you don't pick me first"
[2:58:48] <+TheNewZealandStory> @floralkami I'm not the one that pulled the "its a prank" card first
[2:58:54] <+Walopoh> Kill them all Sony
[2:59:00] <%Calek> @GarbageNirvana it's a trap in Fallout New Vegas
[2:59:01] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Oh man he's still going

[2:59:42] <%Calek> @GarbageNirvana it's a perk that you can pick up and you only get those every few levels or so, and you hit the level cap so easy in that game without it

[2:59:44] <%Dakuu75> RIP AND TEAR~!!!!! <3
[2:59:46] <krymzen5> shroud?
[2:59:46] <JayEarly> YEAH FOG WALLS
[2:59:47] <%MonsieurHedge> my pro tip for shroud: ignore the adds and just blitz that fucker with a shotty
[2:59:50] <stolando_florida> Just keep swimmin', just keep swimmin'
[2:59:51] <%koriedacoward> Is this dark souls with guns?
[2:59:54] <tusk102> pat never stop moving you will get horribly maimed
[2:59:56] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory I'm amazed you feel such a compulsion to justify your shit taste
[2:59:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Gotcha gotcha
[2:59:58] <%Estuko> This game is so cool
[2:59:58] <%arcaderabbit48> Im sorry, I stepped away for a moment, Was that a god damn fog door
[3:00:05] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory Just have your shit taste

[3:00:12] <gooeychild> hi pat
[3:00:24] <%Lizard0TM> @angriestpat ads are Infinite Pat
[3:00:24] <+Dragon4234> @arcaderabbit48 nah man it's a "mist gate"
[3:00:26] <+floralkami> @arcaderabbit48 YUP
[3:00:33] <star_feline> I like how bosses in this game is an enemy rush instead of a big thing you slash at like in the souls games
[3:00:33] <+TheNewZealandStory> @smevvster people are starting to get upset by all your anatagonizing, so I'm done now.
[3:00:36] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat fighting archer with explosive arrow rain basically
[3:00:40] <stolando_florida> F
[3:00:40] <+Cardz_> nice
[3:00:41] <$realm_forge> Had my eye on this for a while how do u like it so far?
[3:00:42] <%BestTeaMaker> F
[3:00:43] <+AllenDeadman> So, some bosses have suffixes that give them a certain boost pat
[3:00:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[3:00:45] <tusk102> F
[3:00:45] <+smevvster> @TheNewZealandStory hahahaha
[3:00:47] <Mister_McDerp> F
[3:00:49] <TheVampiricVamp> OH NO
[3:00:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Use Shotgun moe
[3:00:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> mod
[3:00:53] <+Delror> most bosses in this game have adds as a way for you to replenish ammo @AngriestPat
[3:00:57] <foreverN2dust> no more adds=no more ammo drops
[3:00:58] <+griffball13> do you loose anything on death?
[3:00:59] <%Niney_Who> Welcome to Remnant, where the Adds are infinite and the Ammo doesn't matter
[3:01:05] <%Estuko> @griffball13 Pride
[3:01:08] <gigacanuck> now I'm all for reading in games and all, but >thinking that VNs are anything but trash
[3:01:10] <JayEarly> @dragon4234 I hope it’s actually called a mist gate
[3:01:10] <+Walopoh> I'm surprised there's not a game where bosses fire real advertisements at you
[3:01:11] <Crazybrads> The ads spawn in waves, infinitely yes but not constantly
[3:01:14] <%worldbrand> vapor fence ahead
[3:01:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Mist Gate'
[3:01:18] <$Big_King_Coconut> just meter for your mods @griffball13
[3:01:20] <%arcaderabbit48> Not a fan of so many adds during a boss fight. Usually a fan of bosses being their own things, unless the adds are part of a mechanic of some kind
[3:01:21] <star_feline> @griffball13 Clout
[3:01:22] <artoflec> @gigacanuck elaMad
[3:01:24] <+floralkami> @smevvster LMAOOOOOOOO "Your antagonizing
[3:01:30] <+griffball13> good thing i have no pride
[3:01:33] <%worldbrand> be wary of smog turnstile
[3:01:39] <aero160h> all bosses in this game have adds.
[3:01:41] <stolando_florida> HELL YEAH FEED EM THAT BUCKSHOT
[3:01:45] <%Estuko> Yare yare
[3:01:50] <%koriedacoward> This is just dark souls with guns. Gun souls
[3:01:53] <a_mad_dragon> [SIGH]
[3:01:54] <+griffball13> ! BLEEDING !
[3:01:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Well that can't be good
[3:01:55] <Mister_McDerp> BLEED
[3:01:59] <tusk102> Dark Gun
[3:02:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> you had 3 stacks of bleed
[3:02:04] <%Estuko> ! BLEED !
[3:02:10] <%Niney_Who> !!!ISBLOOD!!
[3:02:12] <%Dakuu75> rip and tear
[3:02:15] <foreverN2dust> what's that smell?
[3:02:15] <%MonsieurHedge> i will reiterate: just blitz that bitch with a shotty and you gcci
[3:02:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe dont charge boss on a narrow catwalk
[3:02:19] <%arcaderabbit48> Shroud seems like a really rough first boss
[3:02:21] <%Niney_Who> You got shot
[3:02:22] <gigacanuck> @artoflec prove me wrong chat Kappa
[3:02:25] <rytisone> a boss fight that requires regular enemies to support it is not a good boss fight
[3:02:31] <Mister_McDerp> don't get shot lol
[3:02:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Does Pat have any kind of rifle type weapon yet?
[3:02:35] <%Lizard0TM> maybe use roll more
[3:02:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> fire mod
[3:02:38] <captainnathaniel> if you are having trouble on this boss I have bad feelings on your experience with the rest of the bosses
[3:02:39] <+Sindellah> How do you get Shroud rather than Gore? I got Gore first.
[3:02:44] <gigacanuck> @rytisone I was about to say something like that
[3:02:44] <star_feline> @arcaderabbit48 SMG
[3:02:46] <JayEarly> The real Remnant starts here huh
[3:02:47] <%Niney_Who> Yeah I'm personally not a fan of Add-filled bosses either. Some have Adds that don't even drop ammo
[3:02:47] <%galaxyswirl> thats nice
[3:02:48] <Albedo28> At least this isn't AOE spam Shroud. The modifiers can really fuck you here
[3:02:49] <+Sindellah> And he's way easier.
[3:02:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Game just decided he got Shroud I guess
[3:02:55] <+Dragon4234> @rytisone The problem is in that you need ammo somehow
[3:02:57] <%Estuko> @rytisone I think it was a good fight, and the ads are not much if you can dispatch them properly. they help replenish ammo
[3:02:58] <+gatoralus> @Sindellah its randomized, you can get either
[3:03:01] <+floralkami> @arcaderabbit48 no, he just start, so i don't think he got anything else
[3:03:02] <%arcaderabbit48> @Sindellah Apparently its totally random
[3:03:03] <%Calek> I got Shroud first as well
[3:03:09] <+Sindellah> Thanks, all.
[3:03:15] <%crimsonharvest> ey
[3:03:17] <RogerPoore> My shroud spammed gas fumes, pat got lucky
[3:03:20] <aero160h> @sindellah it's random
[3:03:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Don't you have bandages?
[3:03:26] <captainnathaniel> @rytisone the mobs are for you, not the boss. you kill them for ammo
[3:03:26] <+TheNewZealandStory> Flooding the arena with shit mobs for every boss fight, sure is a good, not obnoxious, way of making a difficult fight
[3:03:27] <star_feline> Jesus that's PUNISHING
[3:03:31] <+Dragon4234> It's kinda like in Borderlands that you need adds in a fight in case you get downed so you can revive
[3:03:31] <Mister_McDerp> use bandage
[3:03:32] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:03:42] <TheVampiricVamp> BIG DAMAGE
[3:03:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Canonically, didn't Earth lose because everything had infinite spawns and infinite adds all the time?
[3:03:45] <%Estuko> LUL that one ad saved Pat, "GET DOWN MR PRESIDENT"
[3:03:52] <%thegreatestbambe> monkaS
[3:03:53] <$realm_forge> This is getting me all porked up for Doom Eternal
[3:03:54] <justaguy3> btw pat you can get a completly diferent boss on other rerolls.
[3:03:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Not having a true ranged weapon against a teleporting archer feels not great. At least he seems to have relatively low health though?
[3:03:55] <%MonsieurHedge> close! just gotta keep it upsies
[3:03:56] <%Niney_Who> Yep
[3:03:58] <professormorrigan> Fighting Shroud? Pog
[3:03:59] <zv1neda> did pat upgrade his gear?
[3:04:02] <OldManDeckardCain> 15 minutes ago chat was like "too easy to call dark souls" LUL
[3:04:03] <CurrySauseBandit> @AngriestPat You have a smg still.
[3:04:03] <%galaxyswirl> u see the do it?
[3:04:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> BURN the shroud
[3:04:04] <%radda343> pet babby for luck
[3:04:11] <%MonsieurHedge> also the mod this guy drops is OP as fuck and will carry you the entire game
[3:04:11] <+smevvster> Lmao the boss literally has 2 moves and a teleport.
[3:04:11] <%Estuko> @OldManDeckardCain it gets tough sometimes lmao
[3:04:11] <professormorrigan> Is this your first char? @AngriestPat
[3:04:13] <Mister_McDerp> git gud
[3:04:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> BEWARE THE SILVER SHROUD!
[3:04:19] <TalekAetem> @AngriestPat uses bandages ot stop bleeding
[3:04:21] <%Estuko> LUL
[3:04:22] <+Nomicro4u> DO IT SHROOD
[3:04:24] <%Lizard0TM> try co op?
[3:04:26] <Crazybrads> Did he upgrade his armour?
[3:04:30] <gigacanuck> maybe grind a little more
[3:04:35] <%Doruben> LUL
[3:04:37] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat Maybe move to a more long range gun like the pistole since he teleports all over?
[3:04:37] <professormorrigan> should play with mustard queen
[3:04:38] <TheVampiricVamp> Downgrade your equipment
[3:04:41] <+Nomicro4u> Nah just git gud
[3:04:42] <stolando_florida> You don't need to grind to beat the boss.
[3:04:45] <aero160h> don't get hit Pat. duck the shots with ur crouch
[3:04:51] <+floralkami> @thenewzealandstory see, THAT'S a logical opinion
[3:04:52] <%Lizard0TM> what level is Pat? I came at this boss at like level 20 ish
[3:04:53] <%Estuko> @gigacanuck it's not too difficult, he just needs to find out the flow of the fight
[3:04:56] <%GarbageNirvana> SMG's doing work
[3:04:59] <MavMarsh> not really much you can grind at this point
[3:05:04] <aero160h> or strafe while shooting
[3:05:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @oldmandeckardcain The difference is that in Dark Souls even the mooks can fuck you. Everything but the boss has been super easy thus far
[3:05:06] <gustavozxd> chat is beating the sack right now
[3:05:07] <gigacanuck> @stolando_florida it's not about need, it's about makes it easier
[3:05:08] <gooeychild> @AngriestPat get gud
[3:05:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thank you SMG ramasama
[3:05:21] <star_feline> At LEAST he only shoots twice
[3:05:29] <+Rezca> bandages would be nice on the hotbar here
[3:05:31] <%Theophilus567> Is that the game that’s like dark souls with guns?
[3:05:32] <%Estuko> Pat's advantage is that he can overwhelm anyone, it's just the Shroud's incredible range that gets him
[3:05:32] <+Nomicro4u> still bleeding... [SIGH]
[3:05:39] <%Theophilus567> Also. Is this game any good?
[3:05:40] <StromkoPenguin> Now he knows how ladies feel.
[3:05:41] <%Dakuu75> where's the Esuna?!
[3:05:42] <+AllenDeadman> oh so the light is not the attack queue
[3:05:42] <+GenesisKnight> Doesn't he have bandages
[3:05:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Man, don't you just hate it when you bleed to death
[3:05:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Such an inconvenience
[3:05:54] <transporterthesequel> He does have bandages
[3:05:55] <Idon__> Oh god the blood bleeding out lmao
[3:05:57] <crimsonsaens> Can Pat get more items that remove bleeding

[3:06:24] <tusk102> @AngriestPat when adds are actively next to you while with the boss you should take them out, otherwise ignore them. Also bandages stop bleeding. Don't forget your shotgun's healing also
[3:06:24] <$Big_King_Coconut> No Camping Allowed
[3:06:26] <stolando_florida> Might want to equip Bandages.
[3:06:26] <+dirtyh4rr1> no need
[3:06:27] <Wan6Saber> junkersREKT
[3:06:28] <%worldbrand> We are scientists
[3:06:29] <TheVampiricVamp> Good plan
[3:06:30] <WhereIsWill> no campin allowed!
[3:06:32] <+GenesisKnight> @AngriestPat use your bandages
[3:06:34] <%MonsieurHedge> but what if he needs the bandages later? forget the fact they're 50scrap apiece
[3:06:34] <%Niney_Who> This game is Lactose Intolerant
[3:06:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat please USE BANDAGES
[3:06:35] <Mister_McDerp> LUL that worked great
[3:06:36] <BionicPulga> faeeHeck
[3:06:36] <+Rezca> He does go to where he can see you
[3:06:36] <%Niney_Who> No cheese allowed
[3:06:38] <+krozbones> All these dudes with swords and suddenly you meet the one guy with airstrikes
[3:06:38] <BlindGato> otg wombo combos
[3:06:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Your shotgun blast salvos are only doing the equivalent of a 4-5 round burst fro your SMG at range.
[3:06:40] <+AllenDeadman> shroud: "I ain't playing your games"
[3:06:40] <%GarbageNirvana> @DJTsurugi Come join us in yelling at Pat for not using bandages
[3:06:42] <stolando_florida> Ah okay
[3:06:43] <captainnathaniel> "oi, stop hiding human!"
[3:06:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> O

[3:06:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:06:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> SMG fire mod get a dot on him
[3:06:55] <+conradical> mind goblins that i definitely understand
[3:06:55] <+ArcLifth> What if I need them right now though
[3:06:55] <professormorrigan> is this on PC? no m/kb?
[3:06:55] <%Niney_Who> But the Bandages make you not die
[3:06:55] <transporterthesequel> If he uses them the number goes down!
[3:06:58] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat they're very fast to use, and the scraps to purchase more and extremely generous. USE THEM
[3:06:58] <SilverFaustX> ends game with 50 megalixers
[3:07:03] <gooeychild> Never use items ever. - Pat
[3:07:03] <$realm_forge> This looks brutal and i love it
[3:07:03] <%crimsonharvest> mister gobolina mister brain gobolina
[3:07:06] <Mister_McDerp> you can always get more dude
[3:07:06] <MavMarsh> this is the bleediest boss in the game tho
[3:07:06] <+WhackyChiraqi> What the fuck is this this looks cool as hell
[3:07:07] <EuropanLamprey> "But I only have 85 of them"
[3:07:07] <JayEarly> Pat you may have to use consumable
[3:07:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god Pat mind goblins
[3:07:09] <+WhackyChiraqi> is this Gunborne??
[3:07:10] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:07:11] <%Klownkommander> you'll die for sure if you don't use the bandages
[3:07:13] <tusk102> pat: dies to bleeding damage also pat: refuses to use bandages because he will die
[3:07:17] <+DJTsurugi> why did you die? I didn't use bandages. why didn't you use them? might need them later...
[3:07:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat use the consumables!!!!
[3:07:22] <MrGreenToS> When you hear her scream, time to move
[3:07:22] <+TheNewZealandStory> boy this game seems like shit
[3:07:25] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Your shotgun blast salvos beyond about 12' are only doing the equivalent of a 4-5 round burst fro your SMG at range.
[3:07:27] <borous> @AngriestPat consumables in this game are cheap, infinite at shops, and give you resistance to the status when you use them
[3:07:27] <%thunderborn32> @angriestpat did paige clog her artery to avoid going to the eye doctor for new glasses?
[3:07:32] <gooeychild> Mortis
[3:07:34] <a_mad_dragon> just don't get hit 4Head
[3:07:35] <%worldbrand> this could be improved with goofy death gasps
[3:07:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> I swear to god Pat
[3:07:37] <+WhackyChiraqi> oh this is 100% gunborne
[3:07:38] <+Nomicro4u> Pet Elmo for buff
[3:07:40] <%radda343> pet baby for relax and luck
[3:07:42] <professormorrigan> Just dodge :)
[3:07:48] <justaguy3> the boss rooms of this game are burtal
[3:07:49] <xeros720> feels like you need to keep running forward, like Dom
[3:07:50] <%keyworthe> @TheNewZealandStory nice bait
[3:07:52] <xeros720> er, Doom
[3:07:52] <+Cardz_> Sounds like something paige would do
[3:07:52] <+smevvster> Is this actually the first boss
[3:07:53] <+GenesisKnight> Use SMG and build your fire buff
[3:07:54] <%Niney_Who> Yeah I just don't like the level of Adds and Projectiles you're expected to dodge while also shooting
[3:07:57] <tusk102> consumables are infinite in this game you don't need to goblin them
[3:07:59] <TheVampiricVamp> Pat, the bandages kidnapped my family, please use them to save my family
[3:08:00] <%MonsieurHedge> yeah either keep at a distance using the hunting rifle, or run him down with a shotgun. i dont think coach gun isn good for this fight
[3:08:02] <star_feline> Even her body is making excuses LUL
[3:08:02] <aero160h> like I said before game is very generous with items, use them.
[3:08:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Seems like you're better off using audio cues to seek this guy out
[3:08:07] <%Estuko> @keyworthe I get it now lol, I just blocked because I'm only here to have a good time LUL
[3:08:09] <+kuervojones> SMG or repeater pistol?
[3:08:10] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat put bandages on the hothey
[3:08:11] <+Sindellah> Headphones are a MUST for this game
[3:08:16] <star_feline> NICE PACE
[3:08:19] <%worldbrand> that was good
[3:08:19] <captainnathaniel> *hotkey
[3:08:20] <Zedkan> he doesnt want those hands
[3:08:20] <%Dakuu75> yeah, Paige's neck vein has bleeding and she didn't wanna use a bandage because she might need it later
[3:08:21] <WhereIsWill> good dmg on them melees
[3:08:23] <foreverN2dust> I had to use the audio ques with my headset to find him
[3:08:24] <+WhackyChiraqi> @AngriestPat I'm sorry if this is not on topic but I haven't played Warframe in (I just checked this) 5 years, would jumping back in be too much or still fine
[3:08:25] <+Nomicro4u> melee good
[3:08:25] <+griffball13> pat rolles way to earlty
[3:08:26] <%worldbrand> ...[SIGH]
[3:08:27] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat advice: Bosses can hurt ads too
[3:08:29] <+Cardz_> I'm in trouble
[3:08:29] <tusk102> question is this seeing the eye doctor the same one from the ds1 playthrough?
[3:08:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @niney_who I like it cause it forces you to run and gun instead of camp and cheese
[3:08:30] <star_feline> Nevermind
[3:08:31] <Albedo28> I love that just punching him has been the best strat in gunsouls
[3:08:33] <%arcaderabbit48> Unless the Adds have a specific mechanic to them, I dont think they should be in a boss fight. They just get in the way, which isnt difficult so much as just annoying
[3:08:34] <Mister_McDerp> F
[3:08:34] <professormorrigan> Assassinated.
[3:08:34] <MidnightBurst12> damn
[3:08:36] <MavMarsh> if you get right up in his nuts with melee he can’t hit you with the sraight shot
[3:08:36] <orangemdt> NOW THATS A LOTTA DAMAGE
[3:08:37] <+Nomicro4u> Look at that fluffy belly
[3:08:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Then use them
[3:08:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> give baby love
[3:08:46] <WhereIsWill> melee do BIG DAMAGE lol
[3:08:47] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> But Pat will have 99 Bandages when hes finished the game
[3:08:47] <rytisone> I wonder if this game adjusts difficulty based on amount of players in the room
[3:08:50] <gooeychild> baby needs love badly
[3:08:52] <SilverFaustX> rub elmo
[3:08:52] <prideofacadia> Comment ca va Patrick?
[3:08:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Which that's gonna be rough for anyone playing this game who's hearing impaired
[3:08:55] <zv1neda> when you see the flash wait like one second then roll you're rolling to early
[3:08:57] <+Nomicro4u> BUT WHAT IF I NEED THEM LATER
[3:08:57] <%Estuko> @arcaderabbit48 killing them helps replenish ammunition
[3:08:59] <+Snirtax> Pat dying of bleeding eight times wondering what he's doing wrong
[3:08:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:08:59] <Ner234> Buy more?
[3:09:01] <%keyworthe> STOP IT PAT
[3:09:01] <PiCheese> you can just buy more
[3:09:03] <borous> PAT THEY ARE INFINITE
[3:09:04] <%keyworthe> USE THEM NOW
[3:09:04] <tusk102> buy more
[3:09:06] <%Nanocomputer> yeah this boss is better with long range.
[3:09:07] <Mister_McDerp> just get more then!
[3:09:07] <%radda343> but if you use them and you don't die they're not
[3:09:08] <captainnathaniel> I think the AI is actually a shroud clone
[3:09:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> PAT GOD DAMMIT
[3:09:09] <startstoprepeat> he can't keep getting away with this
[3:09:09] <+Rezca> Think of them as a convenience
[3:09:10] <tusk102> PAT THEY ARE INFINITE
[3:09:11] <Albedo28> The game increases enemy heath and mob spawns with multiplayer
[3:09:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> but if you don't use them you die
[3:09:13] <star_feline> NotLikeThis It's literally infinite in the shops
[3:09:13] <senfood> Oh boy, it's the brain goblins!
[3:09:14] <+ArcLifth> and if you bleed out cause you dont use them then you waste your time
[3:09:15] <borous> you can buy more for literally pennies
[3:09:17] <@lewdskeletor13> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:09:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Scrap will become abundant
[3:09:20] <%Razputin217> Art stream quiettBob
[3:09:21] <tusk102> if you don't use them you will die
[3:09:22] <transporterthesequel> It's a Sniper Battle Snake!
[3:09:23] <%Klownkommander> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:09:26] <%Dakuu75> @tusk102 are they infinite? like they refresh?
[3:09:27] <%Estuko> ! INSIGHT GAINED !
[3:09:32] <T_Sasquatch> I dont understand why everyones acting like he hasnt done this before
[3:09:32] <+DJTsurugi> that may be the worst reason I've ever heard about not using consumables...
[3:09:35] <%arcaderabbit48> @Estuko As someone who doesnt play Shooters often, I'd rather the ammo just rain down from the sky or have chests that replenish every few seconds
[3:09:37] <%worldbrand> If you don't use them and you die because of it, your time is wasted! It's time vs. bandages!
[3:09:38] <+TheNewZealandStory> @keyworthe sorry, dark souls but procedurally generated and with guns and shit boss fights, doesn't scream "good game" to me
[3:09:40] <whimsicallifestyle> what is this bootleg dark souls
[3:09:43] <aero160h> but if u don't use them you'll die faster
[3:09:46] <gooeychild> What if I need bandages later? *End Credits*
[3:09:47] <MidnightBurst12> cheese tactics
[3:09:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> You can buy UNLIMITED BANDAGES in the shop. DON'T BE LIKE THIS
[3:09:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> just keep moving pat
[3:09:53] <star_feline> NICE
[3:09:54] <%MonsieurHedge> this is how i did it, basically
[3:09:57] <Albedo28> unlimited bandage works!
[3:10:00] <%Estuko> @arcaderabbit48 ooh lol, to each their own I guess. I like when it gets intense
[3:10:00] <tusk102> @Dakuu75 not that kind of infinite but you can easily buy them or just go and kill enemies for them. They aren't rare.
[3:10:11] <+KingOfTheGeats> Adds are harder then the boss in this game
[3:10:13] <xeros720> you can really hear all the adds spawning behind him
[3:10:17] <+Rezca> weird, didn't bleed him
[3:10:23] <%keyworthe> @TheNewZealandStory cool
[3:10:27] <+DJTsurugi> hey Pat, drop your shield to recover stamina
[3:10:29] <%worldbrand> he's doing it!
[3:10:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Look at that, you're using your estus, that item is usable
[3:10:36] <jeffishype> the hall-mark of any poorly designed boss is putting in adds
[3:10:50] <tusk102> adds are the failure of the game designer
[3:10:50] <zv1neda> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[3:10:51] <%Dakuu75> butt cheeks are clenched

[3:11:47] <gooeychild> Consumables are overrated
[3:11:48] <+FoolsArcade> Bullets are consumable
[3:11:49] <stolando_florida> @Brother_Coduss because it IS
[3:11:51] <transporterthesequel> Brute GOBLINS
[3:11:51] <Albedo28> Rub face against boss to save consumables

[3:11:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Brother_Coduss Because it is, apparently
[3:11:57] <gigacanuck> his goblins are only getting stronger
[3:11:59] <Mister_McDerp> CONSUME NEVER
[3:11:59] <%connos_procrastination> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:12:01] <%rytyoung> Pat is a man who desires no consumables
[3:12:01] <%Calek> bullets are not consumable, you get them on checkpoints
[3:12:02] <EuropanLamprey> But I only have 85 of them
[3:12:03] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat chest
[3:12:03] <MidnightBurst12> their purpose is in the name
[3:12:04] <CaptainFrankincense> @AngriestPat your armour is probably low level
[3:12:05] <Mahkulaan> B̥ͦͬL̜̩ͯĨ͍͙ͬN̪͚̲D̥͔̤
[3:12:05] <gigacanuck> CHEST
[3:12:05] <+kuervojones> passed a chest
[3:12:06] <rytisone> but what if he needs them after he beats the game
[3:12:07] <xeros720> he somehow glitched the game to avoid the status ailment
[3:12:08] <Kelevara> Stinky
[3:12:09] <Vivalabonte> Pat? Use a consumable item in a a game?
[3:12:09] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Apparently you can buy consumables for super cheap though. So its a Monster Hunter scenario
[3:12:12] <zv1neda> CHEST
[3:12:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> It smells like MIND GOBLINS
[3:12:18] <%Estuko> Smells like teen spirit
[3:12:18] <zv1neda> PAT GO BACK
[3:12:19] <KaliasTV> How does this have any destiny in it
[3:12:19] <%keyworthe> @Estuko wish the spat out some mean shit at the harder bosses like "take that you FUCKING BITCH!!" or something
[3:12:28] <foreverN2dust> they shine a bit
[3:12:29] <xeros720> shootbangs?
[3:12:30] <Saltmeisterr> its a loot game
[3:12:31] <%wolfofsound> the blindness is spreading
[3:12:34] <%Calek> they get better in the next area
[3:12:35] <Albedo28> break every box you can't open
[3:12:38] <+gatoralus> they change
[3:12:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you are just blind
[3:12:39] <Albedo28> sometimes they drop loot
[3:12:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't they pulse and glow yellowish?
[3:12:41] <justaguy3> @KaliasTV youll see
[3:12:43] <star_feline> You gotta pay extra attention
[3:12:43] <T_Sasquatch> shlooter Kappa
[3:12:50] <+kuervojones> @KaliasTV It has guns in it
[3:12:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KaliasTV its the looter shooter based on stats thing
[3:12:51] <xeros720> seems like they only pulse if you look at them, which is the problem

[3:23:42] <RiceeFTW> @GypsySquid adds are pretty necessary for ammo drops and in terms of zoning, I don't see them as much different from Dark Souls bosses if ranged weapons were actually more viable
[3:23:50] <@SSaryn> Check Pocket Watch
[3:23:51] <+GenesisKnight> Check the watch
[3:23:53] <Cendov> What does the amulet do?

[3:24:00] <%Dakuu75> <3
[3:24:03] <RiceeFTW> @GypsySquid since the player has guns, you have to even out the field; of course the bosses will be "zoners"
[3:24:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> The watch is great
[3:24:09] <Albedo28> watch is stronk
[3:24:12] <%GarbageNirvana> That's your future Pat
[3:24:15] <+GenesisKnight> Character
[3:24:16] <+MrMcCrabby> gotta read tehm item descriptions
[3:24:16] <professormorrigan> amulet
[3:24:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Heloclopter sounds like something Apollo would use
[3:24:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Take a good long look
[3:24:20] <T_Sasquatch> thats a massive helocopter
[3:24:24] <@SSaryn> It's pretty good.
[3:24:26] <AnacondaVirtue> Chloranthy ring
[3:24:26] <%Dakuu75> damn-dude.
[3:24:28] <transporterthesequel> CHLORANTHY ring
[3:24:30] <%aishman> @AngriestPat So funny enough, this dude didn't spawn in my world. This is the first time I've seen him.
[3:24:31] <Ner234> That's good
[3:24:31] <Mister_McDerp> das good
[3:24:34] <%BestTeaMaker> that's just a chloranthy ring
[3:24:34] <tusk102> chloranthy ring
[3:24:39] <%Estuko> @T_Sasquatch it came from space, duuh that's why it's so big
[3:24:40] <%worldbrand> that's a good starting accessory
[3:24:43] <RiceeFTW> @aishman he didn't spawn in mine either PepeHands
[3:24:48] <+MrMcCrabby> yeah this npc is actually a random spawn
[3:24:51] <Cendov> @AngriestPat Be sure to check the rating vs sone stat in the stat page
[3:24:51] <RiceeFTW> hggFeelspiccoloman hggSad no pepehands emote
[3:24:52] <%aishman> Yeah it sucks but what can ya do
[3:24:56] <aeonicvector> nor my world, btu did see him in a freinds
[3:24:58] <%Dakuu75> car-coolant. we don't have cars anymore so jsut drink it. lol
[3:25:01] <+gatoralus> its useful for most of the game too
[3:25:01] <%aishman> That is one of the things that suck about this game, how random it can be
[3:25:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> whats up with the gigantic pizza cutter on his back
[3:25:07] <star_feline> Car coolant potion LUL
[3:25:07] <%aishman> Entire NPCs can just not spawn
[3:25:10] <%Arxel1> Huh, yeah, didnt see the guy in mine either. Thanks Pat xD
[3:25:10] <justaguy3> So! how you liking the game so far
[3:25:17] <%Estuko> @DeaconBluesClues to cut giant pizzas
[3:25:25] <+gatoralus> i didn't get it until my second run through
[3:25:26] <+Raspada_Ryner> @AngriestPat how is the game so far?
[3:25:30] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Estuko shit must be real in this universe
[3:25:30] <RiceeFTW> @aishman yeah, that'd be one of my few problems with the game; not having the choice to pick your world seed seems very annoying, but the devs said they're looking into it already
[3:25:30] <%Dakuu75> @star_feline drink the anti-freeze lol
[3:25:32] <tusk102> random spawning npcs
[3:25:34] <MavMarsh> the annoying part is that you need him to spawn if you want an alternative solution to another boss that might not spawn
[3:25:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @aishman I kinda like that its a souls game but you can't get every single story line thus you have a reason to new game plus
[3:25:35] <CurrySauseBandit> @aishman I find it pretty interesting. Makes everyone's run their own thing.
[3:25:37] <professormorrigan> Nah, the procedural generation keeps things fresh across playthroughs.
[3:25:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm intrigued by this game.
[3:25:42] <+Nomicro4u> WEED
[3:25:43] <%aishman> Oh I agree it's itneresting
[3:25:44] <%SergeantSov> Mudtooth and several other events/people/places are random
[3:25:45] <transporterthesequel> Holy SHIT
[3:25:48] <%aishman> But it sucks when you're missing good fucking items
[3:25:49] <transporterthesequel> That's a taunt!
[3:25:51] <+Nomicro4u> big WEED
[3:25:51] <+MrMcCrabby> ratle weed is OP
[3:25:52] <aeonicvector> Boss Spell
[3:25:54] <%Estuko> LONG DISTANCE TAUNT
[3:25:54] <%aishman> Like the Pocket Watch, or the Magnum
[3:25:57] <Albedo28> rerolling the first area a bunch to get different weapons and bosses is one strat folks like to recommend
[3:25:57] <%keyworthe> rattle weed is the best active skill in the game
[3:25:58] <professormorrigan> Rattle Weed is HELLA OP
[3:25:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Interesting
[3:26:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder if that update they're working on will fix that
[3:26:02] <%Buttface_> Buttface_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 「ＧＵＮ」
[3:26:06] <tusk102> long distance taunt
[3:26:08] <%SergeantSov> Rattleweed saves solo playthroughs
[3:26:12] <RiceeFTW> @professormorrigan the main problem though is that some really good consumables are locked behind random NPCs like that, so it can be hard to stack up on items even through NG+ runs
[3:26:14] <%MoonObscure> bless ya
[3:26:14] <aeonicvector> Rattle weed is garbo compared to half of the mid game ones
[3:26:16] <justaguy3> bless
[3:26:19] <SilverFaustX> monkaS
[3:26:23] <MavMarsh> best skill in the game because it erases the adds problem
[3:26:24] <borous> I would recommend you upgrade armor at least a little
[3:26:27] <tusk102> rattle weed is good for solo
[3:26:28] <stolando_florida> BLAZE IT
[3:26:30] <Ericgi231> Rattleweed is goddly early on. Gets worse as the enemies get stronger
[3:26:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Having NPCs be random events is fine, but giving the NPCs associated items leaves a bitter taste to it. That watch seems really cool, so having it just never show up kinda sucks
[3:26:32] <seycheles> esfandH
[3:26:39] <%keyworthe> use it
[3:26:42] <star_feline> DansGame Ew what a bitch
[3:26:43] <+Sindellah> replace mender
[3:26:45] <CaptainFrankincense> now he says
[3:26:51] <tusk102> it's good until the enemies starting hitting hard enough to break it fast
[3:27:03] <professormorrigan> Weed's pretty tanky
[3:27:04] <+gatoralus> yeah keep hotshot imo, menders is okay
[3:27:07] <Albedo28> again, folks, you can just reroll the first zone without much wasted time to get new stuff
[3:27:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat you'll get even more mods soon enough
[3:27:09] <%Dakuu75> imagine is in 100-200 years ppl forget what the "U.S.A." was and jsut call us the "OOSA" XD christ, that kills me.
[3:27:09] <Ericgi231> @arcaderabbit48 Bosses are random too, you can miss out on boss weapons and abilities.
[3:27:09] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat are you gonna ignore that the old men said there were TALKING ANIMALS before the apocalipse? we did it! we invented batgirls before ending the world!
[3:27:09] <RiceeFTW> @Ericgi231 luckily the mods scale to the level of the weapon it's equipped to, but yeah I agree it's still not nearly as useful late game as it is early game
[3:27:22] <aeonicvector> ???
[3:27:22] <+MrMcCrabby> well he literally just started
[3:27:24] <aeonicvector> ues you do
[3:27:24] <MavMarsh> yeah but by then you can get traits that help build up mod generation
[3:27:26] <%arcaderabbit48> @Ericgi231 Yeah, I heard. Also not super happy about that
[3:27:27] <%Calek> you have enough iron
[3:27:29] <MrGreenToS> Rattleweed so useful, it makes monsters only focus attacks on it. Let’s you heal or escape
[3:27:30] <aeonicvector> just not enough for all of it
[3:27:31] <tusk102> pat just wants a big iron to blast enemies into paste
[3:27:33] <RiceeFTW> yeah, you should be upgrading your gear with just about every new zone since the next zone adds +1 to the enemy level according to your equipment
[3:27:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat You have 7 iron
[3:27:35] <TheVampiricVamp> Enough hi Ron
[3:27:35] <MavMarsh> then you can just spam it before the last one breaks
[3:27:54] <Cendov> @AngriestPat The Zone vs Rating stat shws if your gear is good enough for the zone.
[3:28:02] <SpaceGuntank> its just titanite
[3:28:03] <jeffishype> Pat you had enough
[3:28:05] <+DJTsurugi> "hello demons? it's me ya boi"
[3:28:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @captainnathaniel Batgirls, eh? I must admit, that's a new one to me
[3:28:08] <tusk102> titanite
[3:28:10] <RiceeFTW> titanite hggTom
[3:28:13] <aeonicvector> borrom left
[3:28:18] <aeonicvector> bottom*
[3:28:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @captainnathaniel batgirls? Never thought of that before, but seems potentially cuter than catgirls.
[3:28:21] <professormorrigan> bottom leftu
[3:28:33] <RiceeFTW> just wait til he has to use twinkling titanite hggFeelspiccoloman
[3:28:33] <%Kirby_Sauce> PAT
[3:28:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> !uptime
[3:28:50] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 28m.
[3:28:51] <captainnathaniel> I said catgirls, but my autocorrect didnt agreed with me it seems
[3:28:51] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW still haven't gotten to use mine lol, and I'm at forest.
[3:29:03] <%arcaderabbit48> Didnt he just upgrade stuff he isnt wearing?
[3:29:09] <professormorrigan> Should've started a solo nightmare run, Pat Kappa
[3:29:10] <stolando_florida> No he upgraded the right stuff.
[3:29:15] <transporterthesequel> No he upgraded the right stuff
[3:29:18] <%Estuko> @captainnathaniel bat girls need love too
[3:29:21] <%Dakuu75> look at this dead-space, beacon looking thing, lol
[3:29:31] <%Evan2Echoes> It's totally safe, I promise
[3:29:32] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko didnt get a boss weapon you can use? both the weapons from Singe are great
[3:29:41] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay cool. The Drifter and Cultist stuff look very similar to me
[3:29:43] <gigacanuck> catgirls are sexy and all, but are ultimately a surface-level kink, a costume a woman puts on to channel the perceived sexual energy of a cat
[3:29:45] <+MrMcCrabby> im sure this big red glowing crystal isnt evil at all
[3:29:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> @captainnathaniel Batgirls are probably better anyways. They squeak and they give wing hugs.
[3:29:48] <justaguy3> OH YEAH pat check iif you have a skin for your clothes
[3:29:52] <Albedo28> you definitely want to upgrade all your gear evenly. You'll get upgrade items for +6 only when you average is a +5 across all equipped gear
[3:29:54] <gigacanuck> like when a sham puts on animal skins for a ritual
[3:29:58] <ShichiNoBushi> These loading screen teasers of future items.
[3:30:16] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW I just met the king and went through the portal.
[3:30:17] <gigacanuck> *when a shaman
[3:30:17] <star_feline> Wait how is the old man playing music, is it radio? monkaS
[3:30:18] <tusk102> you get upgrade items based on how upgraded your gear is but also on progress
[3:30:20] <%ChaosVulpes> ChaosVulpes subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:30:26] <RiceeFTW> @Albedo28 not true, the calculation for equipment drops is a lot more complicated, but you're right that it's better to upgrade equipment evenly
[3:30:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 Pat, you tink just cause I was at work I wouldn't hear you talking about me? The discord is my ears now. And I am much better than Ssaryn, I can make sandwiches dagwood would be jealous of. Also, I'm peeing as I write this and you can't stop me.
[3:30:34] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[3:30:35] <%Dakuu75> is there old-timey bioshock music going in the backgroud?
[3:30:38] <tusk102> @star_feline probably a record player
[3:30:46] <professormorrigan> I wonder if he'll get the Ent. That'll be spicy.
[3:30:57] <%ChaosVulpes> apatPorgmo
[3:31:06] <CaptainFrankincense> nice coin
[3:31:07] <+GenesisKnight> Precious antique coin
[3:31:07] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko wait so you didnt even fight singe? at the least you had to fight the Ent, so you HAVE to have at least one boss weapon available to you
[3:31:09] <borous> best item in the game
[3:31:10] <FALCONxPAWNCH> Nice
[3:31:11] <captainnathaniel> I like singe better. he has a baller OST
[3:31:13] <Torruun> Oh nice. I've been looking for that fucking coin.

[3:31:40] <RiceeFTW> it's SUPER GOOD
[3:31:41] <$povertysenpai> its pretty strange
[3:31:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It only lands on heads

[3:31:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lucky Coin
[3:31:44] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW singe? what world ?
[3:31:44] <%MonsieurHedge> magnum is the black knight sword equivalent
[3:31:45] <rytisone> Dante's coin from dmc2
[3:31:46] <+Lost_Zombie> @AngriestPat Go give it to Ace, you're gonna be real happy
[3:31:48] <professormorrigan> Wow, already got the Magnum. Lucky.
[3:31:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> What is this? Destiny souls?
[3:31:54] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko for Earth, you either get Singe or the Ent
[3:31:59] <+DeaconBluesClues> is this game basically wild west future mad maxes shoot tree people for lootboxes
[3:32:01] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW ooh I got Ent lol
[3:32:03] <RiceeFTW> @Kirby_Sauce basically
[3:32:08] <transporterthesequel> That's not to code
[3:32:12] <%Calek> Singe was a nightmare in solo
[3:32:18] <%Dakuu75> looks like Darksiders 3
[3:32:19] <%Estuko> monkaS
[3:32:21] <tusk102> why did we ever abandon the joke from the EOH lp of pat being called PAT in full caps smh
[3:32:23] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko the ent weapon is really good too, it's worth using through mid game
[3:32:24] <star_feline> uh oh
[3:32:28] <tusk102> @Dakuu75 made by the same people
[3:32:32] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW is that the.. bloom weapon?
[3:32:43] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko Sporebloom, yeah
[3:32:47] <%Dakuu75> @tusk102 oh, neat.
[3:32:49] <professormorrigan> @RiceeFTW You can chop the Ent's legs off for a melee weapon.
[3:32:54] <star_feline> The weapon mod looks sick as fuck tho
[3:32:54] <+Kriptin> Wow it really IS Souls, so much rolling.
[3:32:56] <+MrMcCrabby> Pat I would recommend switching to the hammer, its a lot easier to use as a melee weapon
[3:32:57] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW ooh lol, I never grabbed it. I wasn't too sure about it yet
[3:33:02] <%MonsieurHedge> ent hammer isnt as good as the shotty tho
[3:33:03] <CaptainFrankincense> its funny that most of them have 2 and people dont know
[3:33:06] <tusk102> boss become enemy in record time
[3:33:07] <SilverFaustX> sound is better now
[3:33:08] <%MonsieurHedge> riven > pet. maul
[3:33:14] <gigacanuck> PAT
[3:33:14] <RiceeFTW> @professormorrigan yeah, that goes for just about any of the non-optional bosses, they can all drop 2 weapons I believe
[3:33:15] <californaya> Baby I'm Bleeding
[3:33:17] <gigacanuck> PAAAAAAAT
[3:33:21] <CaptainFrankincense> G O B L I N
[3:33:22] <stolando_florida> He was fighting those enemy types before the boss Tusk lol
[3:33:23] <tusk102> pat you're bleeding
[3:33:28] <gigacanuck> you're bleeding don't ignore that shit
[3:33:29] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko just about all the weapons are great in this game and can be used to a certain extent
[3:33:31] <+Nomicro4u> paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[3:33:32] <%MonsieurHedge> i have no idea
[3:33:33] <%XxPatchworkxX> sup all
[3:33:35] <foreverN2dust> 3
[3:33:35] <gooeychild> paaat
[3:33:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Don't you have that instant rescue item
[3:33:36] <RiceeFTW> don't ignore the bleed LOL
[3:33:37] <+jumge> is this game any good?
[3:33:37] <tusk102> paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
[3:33:38] <CaptainFrankincense> pats on his period
[3:33:39] <+Nomicro4u> BUT WHAT IF HE NEEDS IT LATER
[3:33:39] <RiceeFTW> it lasts SUPER LONG
[3:33:40] <%XxPatchworkxX> is this game dope?
[3:33:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> That's a lot of red paint you got in your suit there
[3:33:42] <professormorrigan> b a n d a g e
[3:33:44] <+allups> yo money comes free in this game
[3:33:44] <feralady> paaaaat ~ !
[3:33:45] <Eilocke> really bleeding quite profusely there
[3:33:46] <@lewdskeletor13> paaaaaaaaaaaat BabyRage
[3:33:49] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat You can just buy mroe Bandages, cant you?
[3:33:49] <+MrMcCrabby> he's not fighting anything its fine calm the f down
[3:33:50] <tanarath> But ap
[3:33:52] <justaguy3> pat use the bandage dude
[3:33:56] <+MrMcCrabby> dont waste a bandage
[3:33:57] <stolando_florida> Pat turning in the coin first isn't a bad thing at all
[3:33:58] <RiceeFTW> give the coin to Ace
[3:33:59] <star_feline> Guys he's literally at a a bonfire LUL
[3:34:00] <aeonicvector> remember, bleed reduces healing AND is a DoT
[3:34:08] <tanarath> pat can't use an item, HE'LL DIE
[3:34:19] <tusk102> pat would rather lose half his health rather than use an item he can buy
[3:34:23] <%GarbageNirvana> Is that rescue item one time use only
[3:34:26] <transporterthesequel> If an item is used in game he dies in real life
[3:34:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> In all fairness, Pat was objectively making the right choice there to not use the bandage since he was heading to the checkpoint anyhow
[3:34:33] <%MonsieurHedge> getting the magnum is basically like having the Black Knight Sword drop from the guy in undead burg. its THAT good
[3:34:35] <RiceeFTW> pat would rather die than use consumables LUL
[3:34:39] <+Nomicro4u> wat
[3:34:40] <%punkthepsychopenguin> punkthepsychopenguin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! I'm 1/3rd of a way to a sub baby. Pat what do you do when this game is just Dark Souls??????
[3:34:41] <+Oscarthemowerman> cmon guys items are for the end of the game and to never be used :)
[3:34:42] <%Dakuu75> lmfao. *face palm* gdi Pat
[3:34:45] <professormorrigan> magnum is such an amazing secondary
[3:34:47] <%worldbrand> I clearly missed a joke
[3:34:47] <RiceeFTW> and tbh in this game it's prob better to die than use consumables LUL
[3:34:49] <tusk102> pat drink more pee
[3:34:50] <+MrMcCrabby> stop making pat stop to read your bad advice every second
[3:34:51] <%Estuko> FeelsBadMan I never got the coin
[3:34:53] <+jumge> @angriestpat has Elmo sired any children to continue his powerful bloodline?
[3:34:53] <aero160h> lol you can't teach Pat anything, as stubborn as a brick wall

[3:35:29] <@SSaryn> Put that big fat fucking Magnum on
[3:35:29] <tanarath> Exactly. Pat needs to live with the dot.
[3:35:30] <%GarbageNirvana> apatBig damage
[3:35:32] <aeonicvector> pull mod off
[3:35:33] <%Estuko> OH MY GOD
[3:35:34] <RiceeFTW> it's a pistola
[3:35:39] <+Sindellah> BIG IRON TIME
[3:35:40] <%Dakuu75> now you need bullets for your MAGNUM DONG
[3:35:41] <+DeaconBluesClues> WHY DID THIS WOMAN GIVE AWAY THE MAG GUM
[3:35:42] <transporterthesequel> Good lord it's your most powerful weapon lol
[3:35:42] <Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:35:47] <tusk102> WHEN HE TRIED TO MATCH THE RANGER WITH THE BIG IRON ON HIS HIP
[3:35:47] <MavMarsh> low ammo capacity tho so don’t miss
[3:35:49] <tanarath> Even if it hurts.
[3:35:50] <+allups> u can remove mods freely
[3:35:50] <manoshake> @AngriestPat talk to le about the tarnished ring too
[3:35:54] <%worldbrand> Is having two heavy damage slow guns a good idea?
[3:35:55] <%MonsieurHedge> prioritize hotshot and rattleweed, mender's aura kinda sucks tbh
[3:35:56] <manoshake> lee*
[3:36:00] <star_feline> Magnum and shotgun for good damage
[3:36:02] <%Solidnick18> that's good
[3:36:03] <%IDTheftVictim> don't mention you found that coin on a corpse
[3:36:06] <+Marsidicus> Pat, do you also find the UI in this game kinda clunky?
[3:36:07] <transporterthesequel> THE THRILL OF THE REVOLVER
[3:36:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hoo boy, that's some real power right there
[3:36:07] <+GenesisKnight> We Resident Souls now
[3:36:09] <gigacanuck> big FUCK OFF gun
[3:36:09] <RiceeFTW> @MonsieurHedge not true, mender's aura heals A LOT
[3:36:10] <manoshake> LEE*
[3:36:10] <%arcaderabbit48> That has some Chunk to it, damn
[3:36:18] <+gatoralus> you already gave the ring to lee
[3:36:20] <manoshake> LEE
[3:36:20] <stolando_florida> He already turned in the tarnished ring
[3:36:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat you alreayd did that
[3:36:22] <%MonsieurHedge> @RiceeFTW dont need to heal if everyone is dead
[3:36:23] <%GarbageNirvana> I love to reload during a battle
[3:36:25] <stolando_florida> he already TURNED IT IN
[3:36:25] <$realm_forge> Chonky shootbang
[3:36:25] <transporterthesequel> He already talked to Lee about the ring
[3:36:27] <BlindGato> He already did the ring thing
[3:36:30] <+GunToad> BIG IRON
[3:36:38] <%worldbrand> He already talked to stockpile thomas about the ring
[3:36:40] <OldManDeckardCain> Wait, how can Pat even fire a gun if he hates using consumables? Kappa
[3:36:43] <RiceeFTW> @MonsieurHedge say that in Hard or Nightmare mode first playthrough where enemies eat bullets for breakfast
[3:36:46] <manoshake> oh ok
[3:36:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Big iron on his HIiiiiiipppppp
[3:36:47] <tusk102> @AngriestPat pat now YOU are the ranger
[3:36:50] <star_feline> Got that big Arizona Ranger build
[3:36:56] <star_feline> Gonna kill that Texas Red
[3:37:02] <+allups> good point
[3:37:04] <RiceeFTW> @MonsieurHedge better to prioritize healing because even if you run out of ammo, you can still melee for good damage
[3:37:07] <gigacanuck> that is a good question
[3:37:08] <%skizzuto> because bullets are like estus in this game, they come back at bonfires
[3:37:09] <%BlackJack607> @AngriestPat How you liking the game(or not) so far?
[3:37:11] <+GenesisKnight> Pat loves gun more than he hates spending consumables
[3:37:11] <%Arxel1> Pat looking ready to kill Texas Red xD
[3:37:12] <tusk102> 1 and 19 more
[3:37:15] <+Nomicro4u> weird bag
[3:37:16] <+ArcLifth> The game gives him enough free bullets so he doesn't recognize them as consumables

[3:37:21] <jeffishype> his bag?
[3:37:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat we feel that as your loyal streamers we are obliged to give you shit whenever your mind goblins come out.

[3:37:26] <@lewdskeletor13> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[3:37:28] <+gatoralus> its a big good game
[3:37:32] <gigacanuck> really?
[3:37:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ammo is an exception, I think. It's specifically tied to healing/buff items
[3:37:34] <+Nomicro4u> Elmo parasites have infected your brain
[3:37:34] <%D33TR> think its worth playing through solo first or do co op right away?
[3:37:36] <%starotter70> Thanks for the FightSalad @kirby_sauce
[3:37:39] <gigacanuck> in spite of the jank?
[3:37:40] <tusk102> pat just use the big iron to shoot your mind goblins
[3:37:40] <stolando_florida> KERBLAMZO
[3:37:43] <RiceeFTW> one-shot
[3:37:44] <@lewdskeletor13> Elmo has brainwashed you
[3:37:46] <%BlackJack607> How do I get onto the discord again?
[3:37:47] <%dalmek> but if you die so much you're using up your TIME, the ULTIMATE CONSUMABLE @AngriestPat
[3:37:48] <RiceeFTW> ezpz weaksauce enemies
[3:37:50] <transporterthesequel> PFFT
[3:37:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its jank in the right places but smooth where it needs to be
[3:37:52] <%Louie_Salmon> Jank is part of the fun
[3:37:52] <MidnightBurst12> that's a good gun
[3:37:53] <nademonkey1100> is this the dark souls of fps Kappa
[3:37:54] <%BlackJack607> Figure 7 months is enough procrastination time...
[3:37:56] <aero160h> good, cause ur gonna hate it real soon
[3:37:56] <star_feline> Can you hip fire?
[3:37:59] <+MrMcCrabby> it also knocks them on their ass if you don't kill them
[3:38:00] <+Kriptin> No
[3:38:01] <gigacanuck> bitch is right
[3:38:04] <energywarning> six shots: enough to shoot one bullet and throw away the rest to reload
[3:38:05] <%Estuko> @star_feline no, melee
[3:38:05] <RiceeFTW> no hipfiring in this
[3:38:06] <+Kriptin> Hip fire is melee
[3:38:07] <%BlackJack607> @star_feline You can't, it's just auto attack
[3:38:08] <RiceeFTW> you'll melee instead
[3:38:09] <TheVampiricVamp> So is this game a game then?
[3:38:10] <stolando_florida> @star_feline there is no hip-fire if you don't ADS you melee instead
[3:38:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> You know it's a good shooter when Pat just says "Bitch" after each kill
[3:38:21] <star_feline> that sucks
[3:38:22] <%Solidnick18> yeah that has some chunk
[3:38:24] <%Estuko> ROUND 2
[3:38:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> How was PAT with ammo in Bloodstained? Those were especially bad for me
[3:38:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[3:38:26] <RiceeFTW> that thing is a handcannon
[3:38:29] <RiceeFTW> it's SO GOOD
[3:38:31] <%MonsieurHedge> yeah that gun is fucking dope
[3:38:32] <+GenesisKnight> Magnum is good gun
[3:38:32] <WhereIsWill> this gun rocks
[3:38:33] <+gatoralus> its one of those games that has some jank but the devs clearly had passion and ambition
[3:38:33] <%Dakuu75> I love these Autumn looking colors
[3:38:35] <%Estuko> GUN
[3:38:37] <tusk102> @AngriestPat pat has mind goblins and paige has mind worms
[3:38:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Number go up
[3:38:55] <%worldbrand> Who has worm goblins?
[3:39:03] <RiceeFTW> i think you get 5-6 bullets per ammo pickup
[3:39:04] <Geno4344> elmo
[3:39:04] <$realm_forge> Pop pop watchin demons drop
[3:39:06] <OhioNitsud> !uptime
[3:39:06] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 39m.
[3:39:09] <%worldbrand> perfect
[3:39:09] <RiceeFTW> it's pretty great
[3:39:09] <%MonsieurHedge> im ~40 hours further than this and i STILL use the magnum. shit's baller as fuck
[3:39:09] <tusk102> elmo has worm goblins aka toxoplasmosis
[3:39:21] <RupanSen> can you increase ammo cap eventually?
[3:39:21] <+gatoralus> @MonsieurHedge its so good lol
[3:39:23] <%fattness132> Magnum + Ruin is my loadout i love those guns
[3:39:26] <%cureneckbeard> toxo-pat-mosis
[3:39:26] <stolando_florida> @RupanSen no.
[3:39:31] <RiceeFTW> tfw hunting rifle is the best gun in the game and you can get it at the start hggShaq hggShaq hggShaq
[3:39:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What's the skull diamond marker on the mini-map circumference?
[3:39:46] <MavMarsh> smg may be the meta wep but that’s lame
[3:39:46] <stolando_florida> Rice ikr the hunting rifle carried me all the way to the final boss. it owns so hard
[3:39:46] <%MonsieurHedge> mag + beam rifle OTP
[3:39:47] <FALCONxPAWNCH> Difficulty
[3:39:48] <%GarbageNirvana> How long before Pat's coaching Woolie through this game I wonder
[3:39:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cureneckbeard that explains why we are addicted to pat
[3:39:51] <%Estuko> Are beginning guns still viable when you get further in the game (with upgrades)
[3:39:52] <RiceeFTW> @FirearmsInstructor shows difficulty
[3:39:56] <+MrMcCrabby> i havent found any way to increase ammo capacity, i think youre supposed to just use ammo boxes or git gud
[3:39:56] <MavMarsh> i gotta feel these headshots
[3:40:01] <%Doruben> south
[3:40:02] <+MrMcCrabby> skull marker is the objective
[3:40:04] <CaptainFrankincense> @AngriestPat thats your diff
[3:40:05] <aeonicvector> Pffft @RiceeFTW your funny, that shit isnt even top 5 imop
[3:40:06] <%BlackJack607> @AngriestPat Also I just finished KOTOR and am moving onto KOTOR 2 and I have to say I love the tor series..
[3:40:08] <+gatoralus> yeah the guns are always viable
[3:40:08] <%fattness132> @Estuko yes as long as you upgrade you can use whatever
[3:40:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MonsieurHedge Mag +Penta = Best combo
[3:40:12] <tanarath> Enemies drop ammo, thus enemies ARE ammo. Thus bullets are more bullets.
[3:40:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat RiceeFTW says it shows difficulty.
[3:40:18] <transporterthesequel> Big bosso/end of the level I imagine
[3:40:18] <+griffball13> @Estuko you can buy them from the weapon smith
[3:40:21] <%MonsieurHedge> @Estuko yeah pretty much. i find that the coach gun falls off pretty hard and the beginner pistol sucks ass, but everything else is great
[3:40:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's where the spooky ghosts hang out
[3:40:41] <%Estuko> @MonsieurHedge the pistole is dropping off for me, the long gun I use is very handy still
[3:40:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @blackjack607 If you have the PC version look for the unofficial patches that fix a bunch of shit and restores some cut content
[3:40:48] <star_feline> NICE Hologram
[3:40:50] <%worldbrand> what are those anger grapes
[3:40:51] <RiceeFTW> @aeonicvector LMFAO well other than the the obvious busted beam rifle, it's definitely the best in the game because the devs specifically stated the weapons/enemies were made with the hunting rifle as the baseline
[3:40:53] <transporterthesequel> WAO that's cheatin
[3:40:55] <MavMarsh> you are basically invisible when that weed is ip
[3:40:58] <%Solidnick18> goddamn
[3:41:01] <tusk102> rip angery grapes
[3:41:02] <%arcaderabbit48> Its really interesting to me when someone mentions a gun in chat. And half of the chat is all "Oh yeah, that gun is the fucking best" and the other half is like "PFFT you mean that peashooter??" And its been like this for every gun
[3:41:03] <+allups> the skull means difficulty
[3:41:09] <RiceeFTW> @aeonicvector and through NG+++++ it's still one of the best long guns in the game
[3:41:14] <MrGreenToS> You can adjust the size of the minimap
[3:41:18] <%XxPatchworkxX> anyone here play hunt showdown?
[3:41:20] <aeonicvector> oh for sure, def consistent
[3:41:29] <star_feline> I wonder if the characters says EZ if he ends an encounter without damage
[3:41:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'm back, chat. What did I miss? Last I saw him, he was fighting the Shroud
[3:41:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> I stand by the fact that if the Magnum isn't the best handgun in the game, the game is shit
[3:41:43] <%Dakuu75> might as well leave it there, so it doesn't take inventory space.
[3:41:45] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat enjoy the easy enemies. next dungeon on you are going to be on full salt mode
[3:41:50] <tusk102> @CappuccinoGuil he got magnum
[3:41:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> He got a revolver? Is he ocelot now?!??!
[3:41:55] <+MrMcCrabby> @star_feline haven't heard them say it but i wouldn't be at all surprised
[3:41:55] <%Estuko> @CappuccinoGuil met mudtooth, got magnum
[3:41:56] <jou_star> I have no idea what this is
[3:41:56] <RiceeFTW> it uses minimal bullets and has a very high DPS if you're hitting headshots. the recoil is very minimal and enemies generally die in 2-3 shots even on the harder difficulties
[3:42:02] <tanarath> killed shroud, found magnum
[3:42:11] <+gatoralus> the magnum is amazing the whole game, but... there is another really cool handgun
[3:42:18] <tusk102> @CappuccinoGuil more like the ranger with his big iron since only one revolver
[3:42:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @CappuccinoGuil Indeed. It only has six bullets, more than enough to kill anything that moves.
[3:42:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Estuko no idea who that is, but I'm sure they are a lovely person and smell of freshly picked flowers.
[3:42:22] <stolando_florida> @arcaderabbit48 the thing I like about this game is the gear. Every piece of gear is better or worse in everyone's opinion. It has something for everyone's playstyle
[3:42:30] <aeonicvector> @gatoralus you mean... the chaos emeralds?
[3:42:36] <SaintSoren> Good evening friends!
[3:42:36] <RiceeFTW> @gatoralus hunting pistol? PogChamp
[3:42:39] <%Estuko> @aeonicvector monka
[3:42:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Valentinius_Anodyne but.... I'm something that moves D:
[3:42:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mauser pistols are pretty cool too
[3:42:46] <$realm_forge> This is like last of us and Darksiders had a one night stand
[3:42:49] <%MonsieurHedge> @GarbageQueenEllie the only gun better than the magnum so far is the boss weapon equivalent magnum
[3:42:54] <+gatoralus> no guys the hunting pistol sucks
[3:42:54] <%fattness132> This game is basically Chalice Dungeons done better and as a whole game i super dig it
[3:42:54] <professormorrigan> I recommend a full melee build Kappa
[3:42:59] <%Estuko> @AngriestPat rolling breaks destructables too
[3:43:06] <tusk102> how to make magnum better: get bigger magnum
[3:43:06] <%arcaderabbit48> @stolando_florida Agreed, its really cool! Its not often I see something like this, usually the verdict on skills or weapons in a shooter or RPG is pretty unanimous!
[3:43:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> @realm_forge bold of you to assume they had just a one night stand Kappa
[3:43:11] <%Estuko> LUL ad got BLEED
[3:43:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The skull isn't a marker or objective. The color of the skull(s) indicates area difficulty: Bronze (normal), Silver (hard), Gold (nightmare)
[3:43:14] <+gatoralus> @aeonicvector i think so lol
[3:43:16] <%GarbageNirvana> When is Woolie back from Japan anyway
[3:43:23] <%decisivelynameless> The game gets a lot better once you get past the first zone, too
[3:43:25] <RiceeFTW> @MonsieurHedge I'd argue the SMG might be the best pistol because it builds mod power super fast and does a lot of hitstun
[3:43:33] <aeonicvector> Elite mobs*
[3:43:36] <%Solidnick18> oh i like that hat
[3:43:40] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestPat it's totally not twinkling titanite LUL
[3:43:47] <%MonsieurHedge> @RiceeFTW or you could just use the guardian axe and the magnum together lmao
[3:43:50] <+MrMcCrabby> smg range is really shit though
[3:43:50] <%arcaderabbit48> What was the boss mod Pat got from Shroud?
[3:43:54] <%Estuko> We pretending that Frenzy dust isn't coke?
[3:43:59] <%BlackJack607> Need more iron in your diet.
[3:44:02] <Zalthia> !uptime
[3:44:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 44m.
[3:44:06] <%Dakuu75> I hope this game has mimics
[3:44:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Estuko SHHHH!
[3:44:13] <crimsonsaens> If it's wood you should wack it
[3:44:19] <RiceeFTW> @MonsieurHedge oh guardian axe is great and the magnum is great, but for real end game, mod power becomes very important
[3:44:20] <+Nomicro4u> BIG
[3:44:22] <transporterthesequel> real big
[3:44:22] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @AngriestPat Just popped in, how ya like it so far?
[3:44:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> Okay, when will Pat cave in and make a Gasm emote?
[3:44:23] <%Solidnick18> uh
[3:44:23] <%Estuko> And it's pissed off LUL
[3:44:25] <%BlackJack607> The chungining.
[3:44:27] <%Dakuu75> smash these crates and boxes, dude.
[3:44:31] <tusk102> i love that the shotgun has all this glowing red shit on it and the magnum is just a normal magnum
[3:44:32] <RiceeFTW> @MonsieurHedge but just about every weapon in this game has viability
[3:44:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> ALL THE COOL STREAMERS HAVE THEM
[3:44:34] <Saltmeisterr> does this game have nonsensical guns?
[3:44:45] <%Estuko> monkaS he's coming for you
[3:44:47] <AlwaysBeGaming> monkaW
[3:44:47] <Zalthia> What’s this game about?

[3:45:05] <Zombrocom> Gun souls
[3:45:06] <+gatoralus> @Saltmeisterr there are some... interesting designs :)
[3:45:07] <+Nomicro4u> shoot him in the dick
[3:45:09] <+ZeroGhostDesign> any good?
[3:45:10] <Zalthia> Any story?
[3:45:10] <fearhurst> more like remnant from my asses
[3:45:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Zalthia take gears of war add in darksouls and diablo
[3:45:11] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @Saltmeisterr oh then yes
[3:45:14] <RiceeFTW> i'd say the melee weapons in this game are a lot weirder
[3:45:15] <+cahv123> Some of the enemies even look like destiny enemies.
[3:45:16] <%Solidnick18> what jobber
[3:45:18] <Saltmeisterr> good
[3:45:21] <tusk102> omg guys we need to get the "parry this you fuckin casul" image for this with pats face on the knight
[3:45:22] <%Estuko> I super want that lad's giant sword
[3:45:27] <+GenesisKnight> You have more trait points
[3:45:29] <%MonsieurHedge> story is alright. ive seen better and ive seen worse
[3:45:30] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat you have 2 more trait points
[3:45:39] <star_feline> That was literally the opposite of rough
[3:45:44] <aeonicvector> Spirit
[3:45:46] <stolando_florida> @AngriestPat you got 3 trait points lol
[3:45:46] <+ZeroGhostDesign> any replayability
[3:45:48] <professormorrigan> anyone in the chat done nightmare yet?
[3:45:49] <aeonicvector> its legit your best stat rn
[3:45:51] <stolando_florida> Yaay!
[3:45:52] <+griffball13> free money
[3:45:52] <+GenesisKnight> There ya go
[3:45:55] <%Estuko> MONEY
[3:45:56] <+gatoralus> scrap boost is real good
[3:45:56] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> @AngriestPat btw each trait caps at 20
[3:45:59] <gigacanuck> rolling in dough
[3:46:01] <Crushter> e l d e r
[3:46:04] <+MrMcCrabby> scrap boos is not goodlmao
[3:46:09] <%Estuko> @heckubrickyillneverdie very good knowledge
[3:46:14] <tusk102> @ZeroGhostDesign yeah there is different weapons and differeny play types also multiplayer mode with multiple character types
[3:46:14] <RiceeFTW> EXPERIENCE
[3:46:15] <+griffball13> must have even
[3:46:23] <Crushter> Elder is best to max first
[3:46:25] <CaptainFrankincense> elder knowledge>everything else
[3:46:26] <%arcaderabbit48> @ZeroGhostDesign For better or worse, tons of stuff in the game is random and procedural generation, including some bosses and NPCs. So yeah, probably
[3:46:29] <RiceeFTW> even at end game, all the levels only take 1500 exp, it doesn't scale higher
[3:46:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> MAX ELDER FIRST
[3:46:33] <+allups> bro u are ganna get so many traits tho
[3:46:37] <RiceeFTW> so it's always better to max elder first
[3:46:42] <%Dakuu75> i'm with Pat on that one. Odd numbers suck. Even-gang for life
[3:46:42] <borous> you will never have enough points to make stats even, get what you think is the best stuff
[3:46:43] <+MrMcCrabby> maxing elder sounds awful
[3:46:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The skull isn't a marker or objective. The color of the skull(s) indicates area difficulty: Bronze (normal), Silver (hard), Gold (nightmare)
[3:46:51] <stolando_florida> Hitting dudes point blank with that shotgun is so satisfying
[3:46:53] <+gatoralus> you can get a lot of traits, like a lot lol
[3:46:54] <professormorrigan> elder is GOOD
[3:46:55] <star_feline> Subway
[3:46:56] <KaliasTV> Sounds like chat has goblins too
[3:46:57] <%MonsieurHedge> adventure mode's gonna be great. cant wait to just roll the first area for the last couple things i need
[3:46:59] <RiceeFTW> @borous false, I've capped everything hggWoke
[3:47:07] <cosmicdischarge> @AngriestPat Mex Elder Frist
[3:47:08] <%Estuko> I'm a huge fan of how enemies get knocked back or staggered with heavy gun shots, very good
[3:47:09] <+MrMcCrabby> literally just play the game more
[3:47:16] <gigacanuck> chest
[3:47:19] <gigacanuck> CHEST
[3:47:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Chest
[3:47:26] <+ausl0> sho nuff
[3:47:28] <aeonicvector> Enter the gungeon
[3:47:33] <+Nomicro4u> LARGE CHEST
[3:47:35] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> a ding dong boblagon
[3:47:35] <borous> I mean for pat while he streaming this, when he hits the cap sure he'll have it all
[3:47:36] <+BigBruthaThunda> should me and my bud co op this?
[3:47:39] <hard_bop_sax_solo> what genre of jogo is this?
[3:47:41] <Mister_McDerp> donjon
[3:47:42] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko i'm still not sure if it's by HP threshhold or if there's a different calculation, because even SMG's will stagger
[3:47:42] <%worldbrand> Amazing chest ahead
[3:47:46] <+gatoralus> @angriestpat it indicates which difficulty you are on, you are on normal, silver would be hard, crazy demon skull is nightmare
[3:47:48] <gigacanuck> keep going
[3:47:48] <%Estuko> @BigBruthaThunda it'd be fun don't see why not
[3:47:52] <gigacanuck> you walked right by it
[3:48:00] <gigacanuck> it looked like just another box
[3:48:02] <professormorrigan> @BigBruthaThunda It's so much fun co-op. Highly recommend.
[3:48:07] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW wow really? didn't grab smg I just stuck with the 3 weapons they gave me lol
[3:48:15] <%Dakuu75> I didn't see it either lol
[3:48:19] <foreverN2dust> Jebaited
[3:48:21] <+ArcLifth> This is the sort of game that the chests need to be different that boxes
[3:48:23] <%wolfofsound> 3
[3:48:23] <MavMarsh> just know that on ps4 there are currently some issues with crashing in coop
[3:48:24] <+Nomicro4u> Paige vision
[3:48:26] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko SMG is 100% worth it, it's an endgame monster when it's upgraded and it builds tons of mod power very quickly
[3:48:27] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> eh fughedaboutit
[3:48:29] <%MonsieurHedge> to be fair the chests in this area blend into the bakcground SUPER hard
[3:48:29] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I aint seen SHIT
[3:48:29] <SilverFaustX> pooBlind
[3:48:33] <Mister_McDerp> where chest?
[3:48:33] <%MonsieurHedge> later areas are more clear
[3:48:35] <foreverN2dust> 3
[3:48:36] <%Estuko> @ArcLifth chests do get design changes in various areas
[3:48:38] <stolando_florida> I think they saw a desk corner and thought it was a chest.
[3:48:39] <%worldbrand> I also didn't see one
[3:48:39] <$realm_forge> Everythings brown
[3:48:41] <transporterthesequel> No chat is
[3:48:41] <MavMarsh> and crashing in general really but coop gets it bad
[3:48:41] <%arcaderabbit48> Pat, come on! ITs clearly that box that looks just like all the other boxes! Why are you so blind?
[3:48:43] <+canabananilism> SMG is good stuff. Used it through ym entire first run
[3:48:43] <%neraren> That guys crazy dont worry about it
[3:48:44] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> yes but thats unrelated
[3:48:45] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW ooooooh, does the guy sell it ?
[3:48:45] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko all the starter weapons are actually great though
[3:48:46] <+allups> eyah the should come out with an update tht just increases saturation
[3:48:47] <gigacanuck> further back
[3:48:49] <+canabananilism> mostly becuase I never got anything else...
[3:48:49] <%pilgrimsayswhat> LIARS
[3:48:49] <%Dakuu75> is it near a wall? the car? the plant? be specific dudes
[3:48:53] <gooeychild> Pat's exposed on stream losing it
[3:48:55] <+gralho> Jebaited Jebaited
[3:48:57] <mikesapartment> Pat...
[3:49:02] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko no, but you can get it REALLY EARLY for free, you can literally get it once you finish tutorial (start the crystal)
[3:49:07] <%BlackJack607> Some of there are randomly generated.
[3:49:09] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh good, more sewer
[3:49:10] <gigacanuck> I can't say, I just saw it and recognized it as a chest
[3:49:11] <%worldbrand> YOU LIT
[3:49:16] <+gatoralus> it gets a whole lot more interesting a few hours into the game lol
[3:49:16] <%Estuko> @RiceeFTW oohh, what did I miss BibleThump
[3:49:16] <$OmegaWeltall> dark souls western?
[3:49:21] <+GenesisKnight> Junk rat?
[3:49:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Thy Dungeonman
[3:49:22] <borous> ItS HIM
[3:49:24] <+canabananilism> ooooh this guy
[3:49:24] <%Estuko> HIM
[3:49:24] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat you seen nothin' yet
[3:49:25] <stolando_florida> @arcaderabbit48 the sewers are just in the first area and go away pretty quick.
[3:49:25] <%Dakuu75> no bathroom
[3:49:26] <Zombrocom> So how is this game? any good?
[3:49:27] <+MrMcCrabby> oh this guy si fun

[3:49:31] <star_feline> no bathroom monkaS
[3:49:31] <professormorrigan> the masketta man
[3:49:32] <jou_star> oh god it IS Gun souls
[3:49:32] <gigacanuck> didn't bother committing it to memory because I though Pat would spot it too
[3:49:33] <RiceeFTW> @Estuko look up how to get it, it is a little bit convoluted but it's very easy and 100% worth it
[3:49:35] <%SergeantSov> TAKE MASK
[3:49:41] <@lewdskeletor13> Is this like Blight Town
[3:49:41] <+Rezca> His seed seems pretty good
[3:49:43] <Mister_McDerp> don't steal the bathroom
[3:49:44] <professormorrigan> TAKE MASK - TALK TREE - KILL TREE
[3:49:46] <+canabananilism> This game is a solid 7/10. but a very solid 7
[3:49:46] <JimJamr> GET THAT MASK
[3:49:49] <rytisone> he seems ok
[3:49:49] <RiceeFTW> right as ACID RAIN
[3:49:51] <%SergeantSov> KILL MAN
[3:49:53] <+griffball13> super introvert
[3:49:55] <%MonsieurHedge> AS FOR THE MASK

[3:51:03] <+Nomicro4u> MURDERER
[3:51:05] <%Dakuu75> this fucking escalated

[3:51:20] <OhioNitsud> gib maks
[3:51:22] <@SSaryn> Pat the fucking murderer
[3:51:23] <%neraren> Straight murder
[3:51:25] <gustavozxd> hearing the twitch chat all the time WOULD make someone insane
[3:51:27] <%Estuko> monkaS
[3:51:30] <+GenesisKnight> We got us a good ol fashoined shootout
[3:51:31] <RiceeFTW> the dude was hearing twitch chat, he has to be going insane monkaS
[3:51:35] <tusk102> on today's stream pat fuckin murders a man

[3:51:37] <+allups> cover-based shooter
[3:51:37] <%Septawn> Majora gonna get it
[3:51:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Can't wait till the whole compound doesn't respond to this
[3:51:41] <TheVampiricVamp> SUCH A LUST FOR MASK
[3:51:41] <%MonsieurHedge> FATHER MASK TIME
[3:51:41] <transporterthesequel> Obtained MASK
[3:51:42] <%Piemen99> Well weird guy shot first
[3:51:42] <AlwaysBeGaming> LUL
[3:51:42] <+Rezca> if he gets the tree I will be outraged
[3:51:44] <fugnuggets01> F
[3:51:49] <Zalthia> The law of rpgs- I like your outfit I’ll take it off your corpse
[3:51:49] <GypsySquid> Wasn't worth.
[3:51:50] <star_feline> Obtained INSANITY MASK
[3:51:51] <%MonsieurHedge> dont take that off
[3:51:52] <xxafrodragonxx> F
[3:51:53] <%D33TR> hell yeah regen is alwaus good
[3:51:54] <+MrMcCrabby> this guy just exists to give you the mask
[3:51:55] <professormorrigan> It's relevant for later.
[3:51:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Slowly regen health... but GO SUPER NUTS
[3:52:00] <OhioNitsud> dope
[3:52:02] <jou_star> nice mask
[3:52:02] <+canabananilism> Helmet is good too
[3:52:03] <%Estuko> @Rezca I got the tree FeelsBadMan but I was too dumb to connect it, am I able to like run back and stuff ?
[3:52:04] <manoshake> break everuthing
[3:52:05] <@SSaryn> You also now have really shitty resistances.
[3:52:06] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Now we look like an ASSHOLE
[3:52:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bad End
[3:52:09] <+Nomicro4u> Elmo looks comfy
[3:52:11] <aeonicvector> @professormorrigan it MAY be relevant later, it isnt always
[3:52:12] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> peach and woolie lvls of murder here
[3:52:14] <%Septawn> Mask boi
[3:52:16] <gigacanuck> chest on table?
[3:52:16] <%aishman> OH I guess cause the boss that would give you the entire set isn't spawning in your world
[3:52:18] <professormorrigan> The mask has crazy good rot resist
[3:52:19] <tusk102> playthrough ruined
[3:52:19] <RiceeFTW> hmmm, slowly regenerate HP but I go crazy? NOW I'LL NEVER HAVE TO USE HEALS
[3:52:25] <%Buddha1231> Buddha1231 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:52:26] <gustavozxd> @Zalthia in akiba's trip you can just steal people's pants off and they run away naked
[3:52:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> baby looking good
[3:52:28] <%MonsieurHedge> the mask's resistances are actually REALLY strong for this area so
[3:52:29] <stolando_florida> There's a trait that makes the HP regen EVEN BETTER too
[3:52:30] <Combat_Data> Game rewards you for things you might not expect
[3:52:33] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Yeah I got the entire set off of a random boss out in the world.
[3:52:35] <+MrMcCrabby> it's reaaaallly slow
[3:52:35] <$realm_forge> The guppy set
[3:52:39] <manoshake> break the boxes dun dun
[3:52:40] <star_feline> @RiceeFTW Pat is already crazy dw
[3:52:42] <+gatoralus> pat blind missed boxes
[3:52:43] <+gatoralus> lol
[3:52:45] <+Maximum_KIX> Hows this game look so far yall
[3:52:50] <tusk102> it's super slow it's not even 1 per second
[3:52:50] <Zalthia> I hope the whispers are subtitled
[3:52:50] <%Dakuu75> that regen is SO damn slow, it's non existent
[3:52:54] <professormorrigan> @aeonicvector Assumed they spawned together or something. Guess not?
[3:52:59] <RiceeFTW> @star_feline the mask just lets him channel crazy talk better PogChamp
[3:53:00] <+Rezca> @Estuko yeah, wear that mask and tp back to it. Unless its dead then either reroll or hope you get lucky in coop.
[3:53:05] <+canabananilism> Its best for toping off between fights
[3:53:06] <captainnathaniel> when they said slowly regenerates health, the meant REALLY SLOWLY
[3:53:08] <seycheles> pat's b
[3:53:10] <stolando_florida> @Dakuu75 with the complete set and the trait that boosts your HP regen it gets REAL quick
[3:53:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Gotta be honest, this looks fun
[3:53:13] <%Buddha1231> apatBig
[3:53:17] <gustavozxd> boxes actually drop stuff
[3:53:19] <@lewdskeletor13> This game does look fun
[3:53:23] <%StripesUltimateEdition> that good eurojank
[3:53:24] <star_feline> @RiceeFTW CRAZY TALK REQUIEM PogChamp
[3:53:25] <RiceeFTW> yeah there's some jank, but the game is tons of fun so I don't mind
[3:53:29] <jou_star> this looks like fun jank tho
[3:53:32] <RiceeFTW> @star_feline hggWoke hggWoke hggWoke
[3:53:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> (bang bang bang) Gib mask, biiitch
[3:53:34] <professormorrigan> AA game. Smol budget.
[3:53:37] <+allups> some people arent liking the graphics i get its a little brown but i like it
[3:53:38] <@lewdskeletor13> A little jank never hurt no one
[3:53:40] <Crushter> I dunno if jank means its not DMC where your attacks are basically locked towards enemies
[3:53:40] <RiceeFTW> the devs are working REALLY HARD too
[3:53:42] <%Puhff> Eh, I found grey, brown, and red to get old very quickly
[3:53:42] <@SSaryn> It gud. It do the big.
[3:53:43] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The color palette for the world is making me SUPER blind to so many boxes and chests and stuff! It's really bad.
[3:53:47] <tusk102> @AngriestPat it's fun jank tho
[3:53:48] <viciousgrim> i think any thing wood drops stuff
[3:53:50] <+Maximum_KIX> How customizable is your mans tsbCPM
[3:53:55] <%fattness132> Its Chalice Dungeons on steroids i love it
[3:53:57] <%Shonen_hero> I like just a little jank. That's what so good about the first Witcher. It's got a bit of jank but it's fun to play
[3:54:00] <RiceeFTW> the devs love to stop in to streams and ask how the game is
[3:54:01] <+GenesisKnight> Can you take the mask off?
[3:54:05] <gustavozxd> random ass question but does anyone know if jojo eyes of heaven is any good?
[3:54:07] <@lewdskeletor13> @ssaryn No what else is gud? You
[3:54:08] <+ArcLifth> Does he big purr?
[3:54:09] <%MoonObscure> cute
[3:54:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Challis donjon
[3:54:14] <%Piemen99> BABY
[3:54:15] <TheVampiricVamp> Happy boy best boy
[3:54:15] <%GarbageNirvana> apatGib
[3:54:16] <gustavozxd> happy emlo
[3:54:18] <gigacanuck> @GenesisKnight it would be extremely painful
[3:54:18] <+canabananilism> You get the feeling that a lot of stuff got cut, but the game is getting enough traction, that I hope the devs get to do some cool stuff with it later on
[3:54:18] <foreverN2dust> @GenesisKnight for you
[3:54:20] <%Arxel1> Well there are bosses and NPCs you might never see in a playthrough. Like I didnt see the old man in the helicopter O.o
[3:54:20] <@SSaryn> ey ty
[3:54:22] <ShichiNoBushi> Other than Chalice Dungeons?
[3:54:23] <hard_bop_sax_solo> this reminds me of hellgate london
[3:54:23] <tusk102> @gustavozxd yes and no. it's fun but also reaal janky
[3:54:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> He's praising the Dumb
[3:54:26] <Combat_Data> The Ancient Core is just fluorite
[3:54:26] <stolando_florida> @Maximum_KIX player customization is kind of mediocre but you're gonna cover it all up in lots of armor sets so it doesnt really matter
[3:54:27] <+gatoralus> Its pretty unique in some ways, its jank in spots, but they absolutely knew how to make it fun
[3:54:30] <%rytyoung> how long does a level take to complete roughly?
[3:54:30] <jou_star> liberate the black sun. that sounds friendly
[3:54:31] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you have an ultimate objective? Or are you just survival murderhoboing it up?
[3:54:32] <%worldbrand> is this early access? people are talking about it like there's still a lot left to make, but i can't find anything saying so
[3:54:39] <+canabananilism> Its released
[3:54:41] <professormorrigan> I didn't find this game too janky honestly
[3:54:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> I'm glad they make loud noises
[3:54:48] <%decisivelynameless> It's not early access, no.
[3:54:48] <+canabananilism> not early access
[3:54:50] <WhereIsWill> magnum looks like it feels good
[3:54:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> to tell you there coming
[3:54:52] <%fattness132> @worldbrand its released, devs have said they want to do lots of dlc / expansions for it
[3:55:01] <%worldbrand> i see, thanks
[3:55:02] <QuaiRolDor> is it wood cthulhu? aka Woodthulhu @AngriestPat
[3:55:04] <tusk102> dark tower
[3:55:07] <+l3sovikk> Pat, did you get your flesh suit from Nightwave?
[3:55:09] <star_feline> CHEAT
[3:55:13] <+ArcLifth> The mask also seemed like it was really good for rot, but not anything else
[3:55:13] <star_feline> CHEST
[3:55:14] <%Dakuu75> lol, chest just burps loot
[3:55:15] <Crushter> I dunno how this game looks or feels unfinished in any spots considering what's been seen
[3:55:17] <hard_bop_sax_solo> magic in this game?
[3:55:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Like that's the game's objective, or just this mission's objective?
[3:55:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Ten bucks says the tower is its own randomized dungeon
[3:55:23] <%Piemen99> What was the beginning of the game like?
[3:55:26] <Combat_Data> Getting to a tower in a Souls-ish game? Ya don't say
[3:55:29] <stolando_florida> There is pseudomagic in this game
[3:55:30] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Get to tower, fight BBEG?
[3:55:36] <cheezbass> so is this a tps rogue like souls game?
[3:55:42] <%fattness132> Pretty much yeah
[3:55:46] <gustavozxd> the tower of <fantasy name>
[3:55:47] <%Bailey__gaming> is the monsters ctulu's doing?
[3:55:47] <gigacanuck> smash th efire hydrant
[3:55:51] <aero160h> @quairoldor nope, not even close
[3:55:52] <star_feline> Jesus that health regen really is slow
[3:55:59] <professormorrigan> Was pretty unimpressed by the final boss in this game. :/
[3:56:08] <+canabananilism> I'll take you up on that bet, @GarbageNirvana (totally havent beaten it already)
[3:56:10] <tusk102> the mask has negatives in everything besides rot and has less defense than his current hat. i would suggest waiting til he upgrades it to wear it
[3:56:10] <%fattness132> Its like fries w/ a milkshake, it sounds gross but its delicious if you try it
[3:56:16] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> fasionsouls
[3:56:16] <+gatoralus> @professormorrigan i think its the worst part of the game
[3:56:20] <aero160h> no survival mechanics
[3:56:21] <+DJTsurugi> is it really tho?
[3:56:21] <jou_star> my only problem with buildings in videogames is that they always look too empty
[3:56:21] <crimsonsaens> Max Eldritch all day
[3:56:21] <tusk102> valid reason tho
[3:56:23] <gigacanuck> aawwwwww
[3:56:27] <+Fenlig> Its really not
[3:56:29] <gigacanuck> can't smash fire hydrants
[3:56:30] <MavMarsh> the gimmick to it is really lame
[3:56:33] <ShichiNoBushi> A lot of Rot resistance, tool
[3:56:34] <tusk102> it regens like .15%
[3:56:37] <ShichiNoBushi> *too
[3:56:38] <orangemdt> eat fresh
[3:56:38] <Mister_McDerp> hat was cooler
[3:56:39] <transporterthesequel> Oh totally not a boss comin up
[3:56:41] <professormorrigan> @gatoralus It was so disappointing. Expected way more.
[3:56:42] <+Nomicro4u> subway benches too stronk
[3:56:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How is this roguelike? You've died multiple times and you just respawn at a campfire area. Isn't roguelike's basically permadeath? Or am I just completely wrong.
[3:56:44] <%Puhff> Does your max health go done every time you die?
[3:56:54] <%fattness132> There is a trait you can get that makes all healing including regen way better
[3:56:58] <%decisivelynameless> You can go full tanking melee build if you get a hammer
[3:56:59] <star_feline> Yeah honestly the health regen could be worse
[3:57:06] <gustavozxd> how different are the runs
[3:57:06] <aero160h> regens same amount as woodwort potion item
[3:57:07] <%skizzuto> @FirearmsInstructor zones are procedurally generated and you can reroll them
[3:57:11] <%fattness132> Bosses, areas, and encounters are randomized every playthrough
[3:57:12] <stolando_florida> Please stop being a roguelike elitist lol
[3:57:15] <mikesapartment> there is no permadeath
[3:57:16] <+Fenlig> Its also 3 player coop right
[3:57:23] <professormorrigan> Melee can work... except for the bosses that float/fly around.
[3:57:25] <%fattness132> yep 3 player co op
[3:57:26] <+canabananilism> 4 palyer coop
[3:57:27] <%Arxel1> Different Pat. Some bosses and NPCs might not appear in your game
[3:57:27] <aero160h> ng+ is a thing too
[3:57:32] <TheVampiricVamp> Subway of Jesus
[3:57:32] <%worldbrand> People are saying NPC encounters are random
[3:57:33] <%decisivelynameless> Playthrough also requires you to manually regenerate the levels
[3:57:33] <+canabananilism> 4 players at once I thnk
[3:57:34] <+Futzleburger> @AngriestPat Map Layouts, Weapon Locations and even boss spawns are random
[3:57:34] <QuaiRolDor> THESUNTHESUNTHESUNTHESUNTHESUN
[3:57:39] <star_feline> bUrself
[3:57:39] <aeonicvector> @professormorrigan you can beat like all but 2 bosses with melee
[3:57:41] <+Fynale> but you don't have a sword
[3:57:43] <foreverN2dust> it also scales to your level equipment level when you re-roll, so beware doing it before you clear the game
[3:57:45] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat @skizzuto ahhh my understanding of "roguelike" was based around permadeath and random level design.
[3:57:45] <tusk102> only 3 players @canabananilism
[3:57:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Like The cript of the necrodancer zelda edition?
[3:57:51] <%Dakuu75> fucking apex legends, slide lol
[3:57:55] <tanarath> Diablo's maps
[3:57:59] <professormorrigan> @aeonicvector hmm im not gonna namedrop them, but that sounds low
[3:58:06] <professormorrigan> im sure hteres more
[3:58:07] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat how long is this game supposed to be?
[3:58:08] <+canabananilism> I coulda sworn I had a game of 4, but I guess Im just insane
[3:58:14] <+canabananilism> crazy talk rubbing off on me
[3:58:21] <%fattness132> It took me about 15 hours for first playthrough, but its built to be replayed a lot
[3:58:28] <%skizzuto> he a good boy apatWink
[3:58:29] <+AllenAlastor> CoolCat
[3:58:32] <%starotter70> apatGib
[3:58:36] <@lewdskeletor13> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[3:58:38] <+DJTsurugi> I miss my cat...
[3:58:38] <%GarbageNirvana> His little feets
[3:58:39] <%worldbrand> apatBlep nice feet
[3:58:40] <aero160h> there is an area with too many enemies that destroys your framerate
[3:58:41] <+aivalera> So, is remnant as terrible as people say Pat?
[3:58:44] <aeonicvector> Final and act 3 2v1 @professormorrigan
[3:58:44] <@lewdskeletor13> Give him big pets
[3:58:49] <aeonicvector> just enough to NOT be possible
[3:58:53] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Did the mask super fuck your resistances? I thought they all plummetted.
[3:58:55] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Number go up
[3:59:08] <+gatoralus> first run through was 24 hours for me but i literally searched for everything i could
[3:59:14] <tusk102> the mask makes all his stuff super negative
[3:59:15] <professormorrigan> @aeonicvector What about the floaty triangle thing
[3:59:19] <tusk102> beside rot
[3:59:21] <MavMarsh> some people just really bounce off of some of the game’s more frustrating aspects
[3:59:24] <KaliasTV> 2 3 3 NotLikeThis
[3:59:30] <%worldbrand> revolver ocelot
[3:59:40] <aeonicvector> @professormorrigan its possible to NOT roll that boss as important
[3:59:41] <%Remery_> Remery_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:59:45] <+MrMcCrabby> the mask is actually great for exploring world 1
[3:59:52] <%fattness132> Unfortunately, the worst part of this game is the intro which will turn a lot of people off
[4:00:03] <+canabananilism> pretty much, fattness
[4:00:10] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> that was just a miniboss
[4:00:16] <%worldbrand> ominous fungus ahead
[4:00:17] <+canabananilism> too many of the bosses are add swarms
[4:00:19] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> you havnt got to a real boss yet
[4:00:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No no, it's fiiiiiiiiiiine
[4:00:20] <+MrMcCrabby> a lot of the world 1 bosses are pretty lame not gonna lie
[4:00:22] <captainnathaniel> ah yes, thats some real heresy up on this subway
[4:00:23] <star_feline> Got that Fallout 3 metro vibes
[4:00:26] <KaliasTV> All the streams I saw of this just had regular enemy bosses
[4:00:29] <+gatoralus> difficulty go up
[4:00:33] <%Calek> game gets a lot more interesting once you're past the first area
[4:00:35] <tusk102> purge this place in holy hellfire
[4:00:38] <%skizzuto> hey man, these enemies look like they could be some fun guys
[4:00:40] <professormorrigan> @aeonicvector I mean, you'll need competent ranged capabilities for the flappybois otherwise you're just stuck.
[4:00:53] <aero160h> resistance isn't a huge deal throughout the game. if u have the consumables to cure the ailments ur fine.
[4:01:03] <tusk102> these enemies look like the plant guy ben 10 turned into lmao
[4:01:04] <professormorrigan> But you're right, you can melee most stuff. It could get rough in a couple of area though
[4:01:05] <+canabananilism> 3rd world bosses I fought were dope
[4:01:06] <aeonicvector> yes, but its only like 2 bosses that can stop the gunless run
[4:01:07] <+DJTsurugi> ever have one of those moments when things just sort of work out for no reason? it's weird for me, like literally a first
[4:01:19] <tusk102> @aero160h that's the problem. pat hates using consumables
[4:01:21] <@SSaryn> Eyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[4:01:24] <borous> fantastic ring
[4:01:24] <transporterthesequel> WAO
[4:01:26] <%worldbrand> WOAH
[4:01:28] <transporterthesequel> Max blessed run
[4:01:30] <%ThatOneGameTester> COwards Ring
[4:01:32] <+GenesisKnight> Sneak attack ring
[4:01:33] <%Doruben> stelth
[4:01:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Sneak damage?
[4:01:36] <jou_star> Nice
[4:01:36] <+DJTsurugi> 100% sneak attack crit
[4:01:36] <gigacanuck> mmmmm yeah
[4:01:39] <KaliasTV> Backst..gun
[4:01:40] <+AllenDeadman> NICE
[4:01:40] <+gatoralus> really great ring
[4:01:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Does the pocketwatch do something? Do you have it equipped or was it just in inventory?
[4:01:42] <%SergeantSov> What is with Pat's seed goddamn
[4:01:42] <gigacanuck> delicious crits
[4:01:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Completely different spot from where I found it
[4:01:47] <+aivalera> That’s a goo ribg!!!
[4:01:48] <%worldbrand> time for crouch
[4:01:53] <+canabananilism> still not sure if the crit bonus applies in combat, or just for the sneaks
[4:01:54] <tusk102> @FirearmsInstructor it's the chloranthy ring
[4:01:58] <Combat_Data> I hear you can kind of stealth in this
[4:02:06] <+Rezca> Unfortunately this game is not heavy on the sealth
[4:02:06] <+gatoralus> he got gud seed with strong big big items
[4:02:09] <star_feline> Try crouching for sneak
[4:02:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @tusk102 idk what that is. Not a DS guy ;( Mind elaborating? Thanks :)
[4:02:17] <%fattness132> I am so happy that the devs let you reload while rolling.
[4:02:18] <%Kirby_Sauce> Why do all these VAs have problems with David? At least the popular ones...
[4:02:25] <+canabananilism> its a decent ring for the surface if you have a sniper
[4:02:26] <+MrMcCrabby> yeah this is a pretty good world seed
[4:02:28] <tusk102> @FirearmsInstructor stamina regen and loses less stamina
[4:02:30] <+canabananilism> not much use otherwise
[4:02:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 Why do all these VAs have problems with David? At least the popular ones...
[4:02:33] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[4:02:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @tusk102 thanks man
[4:02:46] <professormorrigan> They scaled to your ilvl.
[4:02:51] <professormorrigan> Or something.
[4:02:58] <aeonicvector> remember bleeding halves heals
[4:03:11] <%worldbrand> i dig that machete thing
[4:03:20] <star_feline> Is it me or is the player character more crazy talking
[4:03:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 Cause whenever I hear about VA teams on stuff, the best ones are filled with David Haters *badum-tsss.....
[4:03:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[4:03:30] <gigacanuck> Paaaaat use the consumable
[4:03:31] <+kuervojones> Where did Pat get the revolver?
[4:03:42] <+canabananilism> melee those guys
[4:03:45] <+canabananilism> dont shoot them
[4:03:46] <+MrMcCrabby> revolver is from a quest itme that is a random spawn
[4:03:46] <tusk102> @kuervojones turned in a coin to ace
[4:03:46] <+Rezca> New variant
[4:03:47] <%worldbrand> he traded a coin for it if i remember right?
[4:03:48] <+DJTsurugi> Kirby go to the corner please...
[4:03:48] <+GenesisKnight> @kuervojones he gave someone a precious antique coin
[4:03:50] <professormorrigan> immolater
[4:03:56] <aeonicvector> some do
[4:03:58] <+canabananilism> black = fire when shot
[4:03:59] <professormorrigan> just a rando elite
[4:04:00] <manoshake> Elite mob
[4:04:01] <%decisivelynameless> new emeny tupe
[4:04:01] <Zombrocom> It's his hobby
[4:04:05] <captainnathaniel> meet the immolator
[4:04:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @Zombrocom lol
[4:04:12] <+MrMcCrabby> he wants to give you a warm hug
[4:04:16] <aero160h> enemies only scale to level when co-oping. they have set levels otherwise
[4:04:17] <+rendingmelody> his type? hot men
[4:04:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Too much skin oil because he hasn't been bathing
[4:04:19] <%SergeantSov> Immolators are covered in oil and explode on fire when you shoot them
[4:04:28] <Meekest> How's Bloodborne 2
[4:04:33] <stolando_florida> hitting Immolators with melee does not ignite them.
[4:04:34] <aeonicvector> @aero160h incorrcet, enemies scale to area generated level
[4:04:47] <$realm_forge> He's been pent up 4 a while
[4:04:52] <foreverN2dust> the twisted fire maker
[4:04:52] <professormorrigan> @aero160h I heard the level is set when you first enter an area/dungeon.
[4:04:53] <aero160h> that's a set level
[4:04:54] <%Doruben> look up
[4:04:55] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm the firestarter
[4:04:57] <AdmiralButtloaf> The Burnbringer
[4:04:58] <+Rezca> The part of the game I hate, the scaling
[4:04:59] <+DJTsurugi> said no one ever
[4:05:05] <%Shonen_hero> You are the fire that burns the Amazon
[4:05:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Twisted firestarter
[4:05:06] <TheVampiricVamp> Pat "Firemaker" it's his in-ring name
[4:05:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Sewer? It seems like a trainyard or something... :|
[4:05:08] <aeonicvector> so they either have your gear level, or the area level
[4:05:09] <OhioNitsud> pat doesn't like to get shot either, go figure
[4:05:10] <%MagickBurritoh> it's a tunnel level
[4:05:11] <foreverN2dust> @GarbageNirvana this guy gets it
[4:05:12] <star_feline> It's not even a sewer
[4:05:19] <captainnathaniel> pretty in a "wow, these monsters corrupted everything" kind of way
[4:05:23] <professormorrigan> Game would become trivial without scaling.
[4:05:24] <%Kaask> thats the subway
[4:05:26] <%worldbrand> please do not poop on the train tracks
[4:05:28] <%Boscuito> das a toofer
[4:05:33] <+canabananilism> Scaling works according to gear level. Ares have a minimum, and will scale up to your gear when you FIRST enter an area. Wont change until you re-roll the world
[4:05:34] <+MrMcCrabby> its pretty if you really like red
[4:05:46] <AlwaysBeGaming> LUL
[4:05:47] <OhioNitsud> good trades
[4:05:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Nice fucking triple kill. Gotta love shotties :)
[4:05:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's not surprising that it's cool, considering how damp the place is
[4:05:49] <%Dakuu75> WTF LOL
[4:05:50] <Combat_Data> oh no
[4:05:51] <%SergeantSov> There he is!
[4:05:51] <%skizzuto> that was dope
[4:05:51] <+allups> this guys a bitch
[4:05:53] <star_feline> monkaS
[4:05:54] <%SergeantSov> THIS FUCK
[4:05:54] <jou_star> OH
[4:05:54] <Ner234> monkaS
[4:05:56] <+GenesisKnight> That was pretty awesome
[4:05:57] <%pilgrimsayswhat> have to fight him melee or shoot when he's about to swing
[4:05:58] <Mister_McDerp> PogChamp
[4:06:02] <+canabananilism> HEAL MOTHERFUCKER
[4:06:04] <Mister_McDerp> that guys hype
[4:06:07] <+allups> dont get grabbed mother fucker
[4:06:07] <Ner234> THAT was cool
[4:06:08] <Crushter> holy shit pat almost got decapitated and then did
[4:06:09] <+Rezca> I love those guys
[4:06:10] <FirearmsInstructor> Bullshit
[4:06:11] <jou_star> F
[4:06:12] <%Wallabri> woah
[4:06:12] <%skizzuto> don't hit him while he's glowing I guess
[4:06:12] <tusk102> @AngriestPat you can't harm him when he glows
[4:06:13] <%pilgrimsayswhat> lol nvm, i guess he's different
[4:06:13] <professormorrigan> They can cut your head off.
[4:06:14] <%dekkitout> I'm having Taken Captain flashbacks NotLikeThis
[4:06:15] <%worldbrand> he was glowing red
[4:06:15] <%MagickBurritoh> invincibility
[4:06:18] <@SSaryn> Yeah those guys aren't ok
[4:06:20] <krymzen5> huh
[4:06:20] <+gatoralus> that dude is so cool, but a total fucker
[4:06:23] <+MrMcCrabby> no you *need* to hit him when he glows
[4:06:26] <%SergeantSov> That motherfucker fucking ruined my life two days ago
[4:06:26] <%fattness132> He has armor you have to break to deal damage to him
[4:06:27] <+AllenDeadman> he's a fuck
[4:06:28] <%Remery_> He has a poncho :)
[4:06:29] <FirearmsInstructor> He have berkserker rage invul or something??
[4:06:31] <+Uulyaoth> You gotta poop in his buttt
[4:06:31] <RupanSen> 99 ADP build
[4:06:32] <+allups> Blood armor
[4:06:32] <%Arxel1> He's fucking cool, thats what
[4:06:34] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat meet the "you fucked up" guy
[4:06:34] <@SSaryn> They basically buff themselves and take no damage, it acts like a FFXIV Stoneskin.
[4:06:48] <tusk102> @AngriestPat glowing red=big boy armor
[4:06:48] <$realm_forge> Thats Scott He's a dick
[4:06:49] <professormorrigan> Just like Resident Evil 4!
[4:06:55] <professormorrigan> Kinda where it started.
[4:06:58] <MrGreenToS> That type can block shots, gotta wait for it to rush you then shoot it
[4:06:59] <+MrMcCrabby> shooting them gets rid of the glowy armor
[4:07:00] <%worldbrand> they have a lag switch self buff
[4:07:01] <+katarjin> How ya'll be toning?
[4:07:15] <manoshake> Theres a mod for that
[4:07:15] <%Doruben> shoot the floor bomb
[4:07:18] <+MrMcCrabby> pat there is a grenade launcher mod
[4:07:19] <%SergeantSov> You wish you had a grenade huh...interesting....
[4:07:19] <%pilgrimsayswhat> There are mods that kind of fill that role
[4:07:20] <+Rezca> its what the weapon mods are for
[4:07:21] <grayjammer> you cant hit them if theyre naruto running
[4:07:22] <+allups> u mean a mod
[4:07:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you not? What are the items on bottom left D-pad wheel?
[4:07:30] <tri3dgE027> So this game's variety only comes down to three for the Primary (Shotgun, Sawed-off Shotty, and Rifle)?
[4:07:32] <Combat_Data> non-consumable grenades
[4:07:34] <CaptainFrankincense> just pray to rnjesus for grenades
[4:07:43] <TheMorilo> This game looks kinda cool
[4:07:44] <+gatoralus> lets just say you'll probably get something to fulfill that need lol
[4:07:46] <%decisivelynameless> @tri3dgE027 There are a ton of weapon types
[4:07:46] <manoshake> If you find the brabus boss fight, he gives you a grenade mod for the weapon
[4:07:47] <captainnathaniel> are they.... humming?
[4:07:55] <+MrMcCrabby> you should use your mods more, they can help you save ammo
[4:07:58] <+Rezca> @tri3dgE027 nah, more weapon types. But you gotta kill bosses
[4:08:01] <Tucker0603> @tri3dge027 double barrel not sawed off
[4:08:14] <+MrMcCrabby> BAHNING
[4:08:16] <stolando_florida> BURNING!
[4:08:24] <SpaceGuntank> is this pat's Mr.Shakedown?
[4:08:35] <fearhurst> summon hordes
[4:08:35] <gigacanuck> bosses need adds? bad game design
[4:08:36] <manoshake> rekt
[4:08:37] <%worldbrand> oh what an asshole
[4:08:41] <star_feline> WHAT A MOTHERFUCKER
[4:08:43] <tusk102> actually the worst
[4:08:44] <+asgard147> so is this any good?
[4:08:45] <Combat_Data> Monster Hunter roar
[4:08:52] <foreverN2dust> he scream sipsipElmo
[4:08:53] <professormorrigan> use ur taunt
[4:08:53] <tri3dgE027> Thanks for the clarification, I'm on the fence on getting the game, but do love me some gunplay loot-shooter since it really reminds me of Hellgate
[4:08:54] <TheVampiricVamp> Everything is falling apart
[4:08:56] <+Rezca> MOD UP
[4:08:57] <tusk102> pat needs ear plugs level 5
[4:08:58] <GreggyGallz> run
[4:08:58] <professormorrigan> T A U N T
[4:08:59] <+MrMcCrabby> this is when tree comes in handy
[4:09:02] <jou_star> friendly noises
[4:09:05] <%decisivelynameless> pat if you put points into the mod power bonus, use mods more
[4:09:06] <%Doruben> the ads are literally there for ammo replen
[4:09:07] <tusk102> pat use the rattle
[4:09:16] <+katarjin> @tri3dgE027 ..hellgate? man I forgot about that
[4:09:17] <%SergeantSov> Bosses don't need adds in this game, you do.
[4:09:19] <Combat_Data> Get your cat on the drums next time
[4:09:21] <%Doruben> pat forgot about mods
[4:09:33] <tusk102> @AngriestPat use the rattle for that situation
[4:09:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Check ammo.
[4:09:40] <star_feline> Oh yeah he could've used hologram
[4:09:41] <MavMarsh> but what if he needs them later
[4:09:44] <%SergeantSov> I mean, unless you're caring a billion ammo boxes like me
[4:09:58] <tri3dgE027> Gave Hellgate a shot, it does have crap melee combat, but the shooting aspect is serviceable (for the time)
[4:09:59] <+canabananilism> took me a while to get used to mods as well, tbh
[4:10:01] <+MrMcCrabby> saving them just means you use up ammo faster
[4:10:22] <foreverN2dust> You can see them hanging on the ceiling
[4:10:24] <manoshake> @AngriestPat if you melee him he doesn't explode in flmaes
[4:10:25] <tusk102> but pat what if you need the bullets later
[4:10:28] <+canabananilism> most of the come back pretty quick too
[4:10:28] <$Tarcanist_> what is this game, patrick? @angriestpat
[4:10:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh nice smg dark souls
[4:10:31] <%fattness132> probably
[4:10:31] <%SergeantSov> He might, he might not
[4:10:37] <TheVampiricVamp> Who knows
[4:10:40] <stolando_florida> @AngriestPat It's one of the randomized things.
[4:10:40] <%SergeantSov> In my run I got three!
[4:10:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Akimbo is for noobs

[4:11:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH
[4:11:59] <justaguy3> This game loves to spawn stuff behind you btw pat
[4:11:59] <%worldbrand> right in the dickis
[4:12:00] <+Rezca> nothing is immune to dick shots
[4:12:04] <krymzen5> that magnums reaL GOOD
[4:12:16] <tusk102> dick shots, awoohoo
[4:12:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> So why are the trees pissed
[4:12:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Rezca You mean the secondheadshots
[4:12:34] <gigacanuck> oh what?

[4:13:51] <%Boscuito> there was an attempt

[4:13:52] <captainnathaniel> welcome to remnant
[4:13:53] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @bobbenxd You can friendly fire summoned teammates
[4:13:53] <%fattness132> No pvp right now. devs have expressed interest
[4:13:54] <Tucker0603> !uptime
[4:13:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 13m.
[4:13:54] <professormorrigan> big screm
[4:13:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[4:13:58] <$drbuttss> is this a dark souls
[4:14:01] <professormorrigan> was worth it for me :)
[4:14:09] <%aishman> Well as long as you have fun dude, that's the important thing
[4:14:10] <aeonicvector> @FuriousJohn87 Worth if co-op or your super down for a few rough difficulty spikes
[4:14:10] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I love this game a lot
[4:14:10] <%Arxel1> Time to head back and upgrade gun again :^)
[4:14:10] <$FuriousJohn87> I see people praising it, but all it seems like is the most mediocre game this year.
[4:14:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just shit on Pats night
[4:14:13] <+gatoralus> big worth imo but what do i know
[4:14:13] <cosmicdischarge> it is worth it
[4:14:14] <OhioNitsud> its shlooter souls
[4:14:18] <%Doruben> 4 h first zone not worth?
[4:14:20] <%Ixiah> @AngriestPat call help, 1st dungeon is harder than dark souls
[4:14:20] <%MagickBurritoh> git gud fuccboivin
[4:14:21] <%pilgrimsayswhat> That 1 vigor, woof
[4:14:23] <bobbenxd> @aero160h @pilgrimsayswhat alright thanks dudes <3
[4:14:28] <star_feline> meelee in this game is suicidal
[4:14:28] <$heckubrickyillneverdie> accepted his fate
[4:14:32] <justaguy3> pat if you feel like the 2 barrel shot gun it aint doing it the hunting riffle is reaally good
[4:14:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Awesome
[4:14:44] <jordanstayshome> Pat will you be looking into Telling Lies from Sam Barlow?
[4:14:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Hunting Rifle is THE SHIT
[4:14:46] <%MonsieurHedge> greeded out for the +exp +scrap, not enough inhealth
[4:14:51] <aero160h> hold down melee button
[4:14:51] <%D33TR> wait there isnt any death loss for a souls like
[4:14:54] <professormorrigan> lose big dungeon progress
[4:14:54] <gigacanuck> >PVP DansGame
[4:14:56] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat There are no hand-thrown grenades in this game, from what I read.
[4:15:01] <$drbuttss> just grind and get super huge lol
[4:15:02] <aeonicvector> your over-relying on the shotgun and not reloading enough, mixed with your HP habits its kinda risk
[4:15:04] <%Suplexsenpai> Suplexsenpai subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[4:15:07] <%worldbrand> That is kinda nuts
[4:15:13] <captainnathaniel> well, you die a lot, I think the devs didnt want to be that mean
[4:15:16] <+MrMcCrabby> they really want you to replay the game a lot, so it kind of makes sense there's no punishment for dying
[4:15:31] <professormorrigan> If I dropped all my scrap upon death, I'd probably kms
[4:15:33] <%Ixiah> where is the moonlight shotgun ?
[4:15:38] <aero160h> @d33tr cause there's no resource u need to use to lvl up
[4:15:48] <foreverN2dust> each level in health is just 2.5 life, it's kinda not worth it till you can dump more than 5 into it
[4:16:00] <Albedo28> lol, I'd love a moonlight shotgun
[4:16:17] <%pilgrimsayswhat> nice
[4:16:17] <mayorrev> this looks like Warframe but a lot slower
[4:16:30] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @AngriestPat They power up I think when they're on fire
[4:16:35] <%decisivelynameless> how on earth does this look like warframe lol
[4:16:39] <Dreigun> the way enemies slowly advance, then charge forward or throw things makes me feel like this is a House of the Dead game
[4:16:39] <%MagickBurritoh> HAHA
[4:16:40] <professormorrigan> SURPRISE
[4:16:41] <%Ixiah> D:
[4:16:43] <+MrMcCrabby> i would still say dump points into health somewhat early, unless you got a build in mind
[4:16:46] <gigacanuck> LUL
[4:16:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nice
[4:16:48] <Mister_McDerp> jumpscare
[4:16:51] <+GenesisKnight> LUL
[4:16:52] <FirearmsInstructor> SURPRISE, MOTHERFUCKER! D:< xD
[4:16:52] <captainnathaniel> surprise motherfucka!
[4:16:52] <star_feline> BANDAGE PogChamp
[4:16:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Albedo28 My guiding moonlight
[4:16:54] <%Ixiah> DROP YOUR SHOTGUN
[4:17:13] <$Kenzo2000> I just got here who are the tree people?
[4:17:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @Ixiah lol
[4:17:18] <OhioNitsud> instead of space ninja your a hellscape ninja Kappa
[4:17:19] <stolando_florida> They're the ROOT
[4:17:19] <professormorrigan> da ROOT
[4:17:23] <Mister_McDerp> the ROOT
[4:17:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Kenzo2000 Deadwoods or THE ROOT
[4:17:36] <aeonicvector> @Kenzo2000 barky bois are the Root, they are rude and dont like human
[4:17:36] <gigacanuck> 7:10, time to start drinking
[4:17:40] <%pilgrimsayswhat> The Guar'ee :nerd_emoji:
[4:17:40] <%MagickBurritoh> Da root sandstorm
[4:17:40] <%Boscuito> they make all of the rools
[4:17:40] <%dekkitout> The Rootin' Tootin' goons
[4:17:41] <stolando_florida> Rooty tooty point and shooty
[4:17:41] <aero160h> @kenzo2000 they are groot
[4:17:42] <SilverFaustX> so its kinda like the last of us ?
[4:17:43] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I see you've found the... root of the problem, then.
[4:17:44] <star_feline> Tree zombies basically
[4:17:44] <$drbuttss> raise da root
[4:17:44] <Lagseene> the groot
[4:17:47] <+emperordread> So how does this game work? is it asymmetrical or something?
[4:18:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @emperordread Its posudo random generated
[4:18:04] <OhioNitsud> whens Groot dlc so we can fight the root while we are groot
[4:18:07] <%pilgrimsayswhat> This game feels much better on M&KB, just btw
[4:18:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> They ARE ROOT
[4:18:19] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Preference, whichever
[4:18:24] <WhereIsWill> cleanest dodge
[4:18:29] <professormorrigan> The Root are just cleansing earth of all life. They're good guys.
[4:18:32] <+GenesisKnight> Time to buff that vigor
[4:18:40] <+gatoralus> @emperordread its a third person shooter with soulsborne elements and 3 player coop
[4:18:56] <foreverN2dust> the balls on that melee
[4:18:57] <damienlunas> perfect
[4:18:58] <%SergeantSov> That was a bold plan there at the end
[4:19:00] <star_feline> Those I frames saved your life
[4:19:01] <+MrMcCrabby> pat if you want to melee, use the running attack more
[4:19:08] <+GenesisKnight> You got a trait point
[4:19:08] <Albedo28> swings melee out of range, gets in enemy face and shoots instead >.>
[4:19:11] <+emperordread> @doc_ock_rokc @gatoralus ah grand, so procedural dungeon crawler kinda stuff?
[4:19:14] <%dekkitout> I wouldn't suppose there was some feature in this game to reload on roll?
[4:19:16] <justaguy3> wow that crack of your neck was picked up by your mic
[4:19:17] <+anchovypositive> hey guys and goobs
[4:19:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Careful about screamy summon boy
[4:19:18] <tusk102> @emperordread also randomized run
[4:19:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @emperordread kinda
[4:19:24] <%fattness132> halfway through
[4:19:26] <+gatoralus> checkpointo
[4:19:33] <%MagickBurritoh> glowy
[4:19:34] <+MrMcCrabby> you still wanna explore everything
[4:19:36] <aeonicvector> 1/2 done with this "dungeon"
[4:19:51] <$drbuttss> its a rock bonfire
[4:19:54] <Albedo28> I hear there are secret rooms but I'
[4:19:59] <Albedo28> Never seen any
[4:19:59] <Scyllas> @dekkiout only in Iceborne
[4:20:00] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Wait does sitting reset your ammo???
[4:20:01] <aero160h> there's not good description for the game because it borrows stuff from lots of games, except shlooters
[4:20:02] <aeonicvector> there are
[4:20:04] <tusk102> basically chalice dungeons 2: electric bugaloo
[4:20:05] <+gatoralus> @emperordread yeah with some events that are story so they are always in your run
[4:20:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> MMMM health
[4:20:09] <%SergeantSov> "Lets, yeah."
[4:20:10] <star_feline> Honestly they could've made it look less of a bonfire rip off LUL
[4:20:11] <+AllenDeadman> but elder knowledge tho D:
[4:20:16] <Scyllas> Kappa Kappa
[4:20:17] <+MrMcCrabby> bonfires do refill ammo and health
[4:20:19] <+GenesisKnight> Delicious health
[4:20:35] <Albedo28> no, make it more like a bonfire
[4:20:36] <orangemdt> so was there a reason he just stood there...
[4:20:41] <captainnathaniel> they are humming, for real
[4:21:19] <stolando_florida> It's Nothing!!
[4:21:23] <%starotter70> If Woolie ever has a son he should name him Woruto
[4:21:27] <professormorrigan> Anyone else see Jim Sterling shit on Remnant? :(
[4:21:30] <KnightAsteran> so how many "Parry this you fuckin casual" jokes have been made so far by chat?
[4:21:37] <stolando_florida> Only 1 that I saw so far tbh
[4:21:44] <%SergeantSov> Big bad boi here
[4:21:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @professormorrigan of course he did Remnant didn't pay him
[4:21:50] <Albedo28> The main character talks too often it feels
[4:21:51] <gigacanuck> @KnightAsteran yours is the first, though long overdue
[4:21:56] <professormorrigan> But issa good game
[4:21:58] <stolando_florida> @AngriestPat shoot the red shield off
[4:22:10] <stolando_florida> BIG GOT EM
[4:22:11] <tri3dgE027> The voice-quips start to sound annoying LUL doodBenny LUL
[4:22:13] <+gatoralus> I kind of rarely agree with jim sterling so whatever to me
[4:22:19] <MavMarsh> h-he’s fast!
[4:22:19] <star_feline> Ah, you shoot him in the back
[4:22:21] <Albedo28> certain amount of hits maybe?
[4:22:23] <+kuervojones> @professormorrigan Why? What did he say?
[4:22:23] <fearhurst> woah its over
[4:22:28] <WhereIsWill> thought it was a shoot em in the back thingy
[4:22:32] <gigacanuck> what was I doing again?
[4:22:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KnightAsteran not as much as I expected
[4:22:33] <+MrMcCrabby> certain amount of hits
[4:22:35] <gigacanuck> ah, yes, beer
[4:22:41] <Albedo28> neat
[4:22:42] <%fattness132> Its damage on shield - not hits
[4:22:44] <professormorrigan> @kuervojones A whole lot. Check out the video. Nothing nice.
[4:22:56] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat there is a ever cooler variation of that enemy
[4:22:58] <professormorrigan> "The Dark Souls Of Mediocre Rubbish"
[4:23:11] <KnightAsteran> I've stopped watching Jim videos f
[4:23:12] <+MrMcCrabby> idk, dumping with the smg on his shield gets rid of it pretty fast and smg isnt exactly hard hitting
[4:23:24] <@SSaryn> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[4:23:25] <%skizzuto> apatWink
[4:23:27] <Albedo28> Mediocre seems harsh. It's not AAA but that's to be expected
[4:23:28] <KaliasTV> When you make it procedural you're going to get some people having an awful experience
[4:23:28] <stolando_florida> gayess station
[4:23:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> Don't give Jim views. He is a poser who only hands out good reviews for cash
[4:23:45] <star_feline> Honestly Jim Sterling is entitled to his opinion
[4:23:52] <star_feline> Even if we don't agree
[4:23:58] <aero160h> nope, the shield only blocks from the front. also he never recovered his shielding stance, was wide open in the corner
[4:23:59] <+MrMcCrabby> the game has a few flaws and the first world kind of leaves a worst impression of the game then you should have
[4:24:02] <%bubbli97> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[4:24:02] <@lewdskeletor13> We love you Elmo!
[4:24:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @star_feline He is entitled we can agree to that
[4:24:05] <%BestTeaMaker> the fuck are you on about, doc
[4:24:06] <professormorrigan> Pretty scathing impressions video though. Poor devs.
[4:24:13] <KaliasTV> doc got a vendetta
[4:24:13] <krymzen5> Jim can be p funny, but i rarely agree with him
[4:24:16] <KnightAsteran> I've just gotten tired of Jim's shtick
[4:24:21] <%fattness132> I thought you were gonna name the dog "Trash"
[4:24:29] <Albedo28> Plus he could have gotten a terrible seed. The Shroud for him was the AOE variant and its a boss that already has an AOE attack
[4:24:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Patmo, Paigemo, housemo
[4:24:35] <KnightAsteran> shouldn't the dog be Baseball?
[4:24:39] <%pilgrimsayswhat> don't be stingy with upgrades
[4:24:42] <professormorrigan> He got an Enchanter Ent, right? :D
[4:24:44] <FirearmsInstructor> whaddabitch!
[4:24:48] <Aydarkzero> Is paige streaming later?
[4:24:49] <professormorrigan> That's pretty unlucky.
[4:24:50] <star_feline> D: rude
[4:24:56] <MavMarsh> enchanter is terrible and needs a nerf honestly
[4:24:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BestTeaMaker Jim is notorious for demanding things for reviews. He did it for years and only quit escapist when they confronted him about it
[4:25:03] <Tucker0603> HAMMER
[4:25:05] <MavMarsh> it fires way too often
[4:25:06] <Ominnous> "good now go" -has been gone for 2 minutes
[4:25:07] <%NopeBadguy> How are you liking this game? A friend bought it for me, but some of the early boss/dungeon design made me bounce off it really hard.
[4:25:09] <$Tarcanist_> or could one call the house homo? @generalscpatton
[4:25:21] <SilverFaustX> going to play astral chain next week?
[4:25:40] <%BestTeaMaker> is ther any proof of that
[4:25:40] <star_feline> COWBOY REPEATER PogChamp
[4:25:43] <WhereIsWill> NAISU
[4:25:48] <Albedo28> nice that each mod is different looking
[4:25:52] <professormorrigan> I really enjoyed 3-player coop in this game. Was hella fun.
[4:25:54] <KnightAsteran> how much time is there between Asteal Chain and Iceborne, cause god damnit I need more time
[4:25:54] <SilverFaustX> sweet
[4:25:57] <%starotter70> cool
[4:25:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yay anime
[4:26:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BestTeaMaker you can google it there is plenty of times people pointed it out
[4:26:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What's the schedule for FFVII?
[4:26:04] <+gatoralus> the hunting rifle is really good just gotta hit those headshots/weakspots
[4:26:09] <krymzen5> is there an assault rifle?
[4:26:11] <justaguy3> ineed is more of a cowboy repetar then a hunting riffle but's good
[4:26:20] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Tuesday or Thursday?
[4:26:21] <Albedo28> yeah, you blow that game
[4:26:23] <+gatoralus> @krymzen5 yeah there is

[4:27:28] <Albedo28> There's a beam rifle too
[4:27:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BestTeaMaker then there is plenty of times he shat on fans despite being "Pro consumer" because he would get a better kickback if he didn't support his fans
[4:27:30] <@SSaryn> There's A LOT of dumb bullshit in this game.
[4:27:33] <professormorrigan> Beam Rifle is sick
[4:27:38] <+gatoralus> yeah pat its just super rare for whatever reason

[4:29:01] <exploitativity2> OH SHIT
[4:29:02] <+allups> the smg is a must pick
[4:29:06] <%Estuko> monkaS
[4:29:08] <Doomed2Die> oh god what
[4:29:08] <%Estuko> OH SHIT
[4:29:09] <Albedo28> the bosses sometimes have extra objectives that can drop weapons or weapon crafting items. Like stagger it and run around to its back to get an item ala Uragaan
[4:29:21] <manoshake> here he comes
[4:29:29] <KnightAsteran> @tucker0603 PF it, everyone wants your bonus tomes, also some people will join for Wonderous Tails
[4:29:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> I LIKE THE WAY YOU DIE BOY
[4:29:41] <stolando_florida> Wo-oah here he comes
[4:29:41] <tri3dgE027> DMC5, Furies flashback 4Head
[4:29:43] <captainnathaniel> thats some matrix shit
[4:29:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat yea it's definitely a damage absorption shield, not hits
[4:30:01] <ChoculaUltra> is it weird that this feels more like a tactical Gears of War than "Souls with Guns" to me?
[4:30:01] <%pilgrimsayswhat> It's nice, I agree
[4:30:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nope
[4:30:03] <professormorrigan> YEAH GET IT
[4:30:04] <%SergeantSov> I like it too
[4:30:05] <+gatoralus> nah its done pretty well
[4:30:07] <%Estuko> No it's GREAT
[4:30:08] <stolando_florida> I like the little combat barks too
[4:30:08] <Mister_McDerp> no
[4:30:09] <$drbuttss> whew its over
[4:30:10] <%fattness132> It gives good cues as to when you are safe or not its actually helpful
[4:30:10] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Gives you a little more that zero personality
[4:30:12] <aeonicvector> Fire works best on high RoF or ALOT of damage, but consistency is great
[4:30:13] <+MrMcCrabby> some of the voice lines are terrible lol
[4:30:15] <fearhurst> whoa bro, its over
[4:30:16] <Albedo28> he does at least tell you when an encounter is done or if an enemy is powering up
[4:30:16] <%Estuko> "Yare yare Daze"
[4:30:17] <kindashagg> nah it's cool
[4:30:17] <rytisone> He talks to himself, so it's relatable
[4:30:19] <star_feline> NO, because I'm tired of Gordon Freeman ass characters
[4:30:20] <Tucker0603> @knightasteran mkay I'll try that
[4:30:22] <gigacanuck> I thought Bloodborne had guns too
[4:30:22] <Combat_Data> Feeling like they are actually a character and not a weird murder mute
[4:30:23] <%ChaosVulpes> Imagine if the Dark Souls player characters talked... "Whelp, guess I'll die."
[4:30:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> TAC TA COOL PATTY
[4:30:28] <Albedo28> The random woohoos and yeah get it bothers me lol
[4:30:29] <Clowns> i've had enough silent protagonists so yes it's good.
[4:30:29] <%pilgrimsayswhat> "YOU AINT SO TOUGH! YOU AINT SO BAD!"
[4:30:31] <MavMarsh> what’s that one voice that constantly whines
[4:30:36] <FirearmsInstructor> That lever action fucking rocks
[4:30:40] <%fattness132> Like 25-30 ish total i think
[4:30:40] <KnightAsteran> @tucker0603 just remember to unsync
[4:30:40] <foreverN2dust> rooShrug a lot
[4:30:41] <MavMarsh> voice 4 i think
[4:30:41] <professormorrigan> at least 3
[4:30:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 11
[4:30:45] <derap41> not enough
[4:30:47] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Comparable to Bloodborne I felt
[4:30:48] <%MonsieurHedge> what type
[4:30:48] <%aishman> Like 10-ish?
[4:30:49] <gooman_the_gooster> makes them feel alive
[4:30:49] <Mister_McDerp> several
[4:30:49] <%SergeantSov> I wanna say 10-11
[4:30:49] <%Kaask> a lot
[4:30:50] <+gatoralus> um a good amount, i could tell you the amount
[4:30:50] <BakerBrute> 69
[4:30:50] <stolando_florida> I'd say there's at least 20 if you count primaries and secondaries
[4:30:52] <$drbuttss> at least 1
[4:30:53] <Albedo28> above 12 if the wiki is right
[4:30:53] <%Estuko> "HEY BEING WHO'S EXISTENCE DRAWFS MY OWN, EAT MY ASS."
[4:30:54] <%Kaask> a fair amount
[4:30:54] <Ominnous> 420.69
[4:30:55] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat not a MASSIVE ammount but ive got ATLEAST 15
[4:30:56] <%Sh00s> 420
[4:30:56] <@SSaryn> Definitely at least 20.
[4:30:57] <$Tarcanist_> 1 or more guns
[4:30:58] <%starotter70> More tha n 7
[4:30:59] <stolando_florida> There's a lot
[4:31:00] <SpaceGuntank> 20+
[4:31:01] <%MonsieurHedge> i think there's 13 long, 10 hand, and like 25 melee
[4:31:02] <+gatoralus> there are more than 20
[4:31:03] <star_feline> at least 2
[4:31:04] <%aishman> Not all can be optained in a single play through
[4:31:04] <derap41> NEVA ENOUGH DAKKA
[4:31:05] <OhioNitsud> tree fiddy
[4:31:06] <ssks123> way more than 11
[4:31:08] <BakerBrute> Way more than 11
[4:31:08] <%sourceofall> i have like 15 right now
[4:31:11] <%fattness132> Its at least 30 if you count all weapon categories
[4:31:11] <manoshake> more than 20
[4:31:12] <tusk102> theres more than 11
[4:31:13] <%Kaask> maybe like 10~ per weapon type
[4:31:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so this game has character creaation right?
[4:31:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> Did pat get the moonlight greatsword?
[4:31:15] <%Odetokale> around 25
[4:31:16] <+MrMcCrabby> its way more than 11
[4:31:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:31:17] <manoshake> they are all highly unique
[4:31:18] <absolute_cagemony> Yeah but you get a bunch of sick kung fu moves
[4:31:18] <%arcaderabbit48> More than 3
[4:31:20] <tusk102> 30 in all around there
[4:31:20] <stolando_florida> @AngriestPat It's ~20 if you count Primaries and Secondaries, ~30 if you count melee
[4:31:28] <aero160h> u can switch shoulder view by pressing in the left stick
[4:31:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ kinda
[4:31:29] <+king_of_beggars> 8 handguns, 14 long guns
[4:31:38] <%fattness132> M+kb controls are good too
[4:31:40] <+gatoralus> pat passed loot
[4:31:40] <aeonicvector> you can turn it off too
[4:31:43] <Albedo28> crits and weakness damage stacks and that's really cool to me
[4:31:46] <%PaladinDupre> I looked at the wiki and all weapons combined seems to be about 3d
[4:31:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I see
[4:31:48] <star_feline> Baby mode Kappa
[4:31:48] <%pilgrimsayswhat> H E A D S H O T
[4:31:48] <nademonkey1100> cause pat is bad at the aim
[4:31:51] <+MrMcCrabby> did pat not get the mothers ring
[4:31:54] <Xalgar> Controller aim LUL
[4:31:55] <%PaladinDupre> *35
[4:31:57] <%aeravon> You missed some scrap
[4:32:10] <%Estuko> Oh shit THIS GUY
[4:32:10] <viciousgrim> 23 guns
[4:32:14] <%worldbrand> big yell
[4:32:17] <Albedo28> poor tree friend!
[4:32:19] <%Estuko> monkaS
[4:32:27] <professormorrigan> ono
[4:32:32] <%SergeantSov> I do like that they can occasionally hit each other
[4:32:33] <%Estuko> Tat sound when a strong enemy appears is GREAT I love it
[4:32:33] <aeonicvector> also pat, while fire is acive it applies to all your guns
[4:32:35] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I count 37 weapons. 8 handguns, 14 long guns, 15 melee. (From the lists I read.)
[4:32:44] <KnightAsteran> although this game does go for a more bloodborne type of weapon variety than DS or say MonHun
[4:32:44] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[4:32:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 32m.
[4:32:46] <+king_of_beggars> @AngriestPat 8 handgun, 15 long, 16 melee They're on fextralife
[4:32:52] <star_feline> IS THAT ALL YOU GO- uugh Kreygasm
[4:32:55] <krymzen5> 37s p great
[4:32:55] <+gatoralus> dude getting that lumenite
[4:33:04] <+gatoralus> yeah and they are all cool
[4:33:06] <Albedo28> 8 handguns seems oddly low to me >.>
[4:33:06] <%fattness132> And devs have said weapons / armor are on the list for trickling dlc too
[4:33:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> He lit himself on fire to become immune to your firebullets
[4:33:12] <+allups> enough to get to know
[4:33:13] <%pilgrimsayswhat> It doesn't have a bunch of useless variants like DS2
[4:33:13] <manoshake> @AngriestPat every gun is highly unique specially the boss weapons
[4:33:14] <+gatoralus> yes all unique
[4:33:20] <%SergeantSov> Extremely unique
[4:33:21] <aeonicvector> also they are going to keep supporting the game and added new tiles, maps and weapons if possible
[4:33:25] <ChoculaUltra> did Pat finish grinding out the Solstice armor? I saw he got the Ace and allat.
[4:33:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat lol shit is SUPER diverse and crazy sounding
[4:33:29] <%Piemen99> what are you going to do stab me?! -gets stabbed-
[4:33:35] <+razzoth> theres a gun that shoots black holes
[4:33:40] <%worldbrand> Well if you shoot yourself enough you also become immune to bullets
[4:33:44] <professormorrigan> Repulsor?
[4:33:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Do you prefer us to Siri or Alexa @angriestpat
[4:33:47] <%arcaderabbit48> You cant stab me, I've already stabbed myself!
[4:33:48] <professormorrigan> wait no
[4:33:49] <%GarbageNirvana> Well what were you gonna do, set him more on fire?
[4:33:51] <%Estuko> @worldbrand I.. well... son of a
[4:33:52] <+allups> i know whn im on fire im immune to fire
[4:33:55] <%dekkitout> Now do any of those guns silently judge me or create Wolfpack rounds?
[4:33:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GarbageNirvana yes
[4:34:02] <KnightAsteran> there's a radiation laser gun that gets stronger the longer you shoot
[4:34:07] <Albedo28> I mean, we joke, but literally if you get killed by allies enough, you get resistance to friendly fire in this game
[4:34:18] <aeonicvector> Yo number of guns is cool but lets avoid hard specifics on weird ones
[4:34:19] <%worldbrand> that's pretty neat
[4:34:24] <%shadowace2400> do you have the ff14 GARO mounts?
[4:34:26] <star_feline> NICE headshot
[4:34:32] <star_feline> for auto aim Kappa
[4:34:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you open your inventory for a moment? What weapons do you have in your loadout currently?
[4:34:34] <cstigerwright> How are the boss fights in this so far?
[4:34:34] <$Tarcanist_> if they become immune to fire bullet when on fire, why don't they become immune to bullets after being shot once?
[4:34:38] <%fabulousgaybear> fabulousgaybear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:34:40] <Mister_McDerp> i heard a caribou
[4:34:41] <KnightAsteran> @albedo28 yeah get knocked down by a friendly 10 times and you unlock the friendly fire resistance trait
[4:34:42] <stolando_florida> BIG LEVER ACTION
[4:34:43] <+gatoralus> i used that gun most of the game
[4:34:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good gun big
[4:34:55] <orangemdt> just high noon'd some sticks
[4:34:56] <Albedo28> I hope that Pat feels that way about each new gun.
[4:34:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat apparently the entire game is balanced around that gun
[4:34:58] <FirearmsInstructor> melee?
[4:35:01] <foreverN2dust> and a pizza cutter
[4:35:02] <%starotter70> Who said that?
[4:35:03] <+MrMcCrabby> its more that the coach gun sucks
[4:35:04] <professormorrigan> is it boss time
[4:35:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What's the melee?
[4:35:14] <stolando_florida> @doc_ock_rokc there's much better weapons but the lever action rifle is the best starter IMO
[4:35:17] <ChoculaUltra> ah no sweat about the Solstice armor. It just looked cool is all. I'm p sure everyone will get Armor 2.0 gear out the gate in Shadowkeep by just playin'.
[4:35:17] <%Estuko> my favorite mini boss is the mother fucker who flash steps out of the way of your bullets
[4:35:19] <SoySocks> breaking bad movie about jesse pinkman coming to netflix
[4:35:25] <%GarbageNirvana> I imagine the coach gun you could eventually make better
[4:35:31] <star_feline> @SoySocks WHAT
[4:35:31] <%GarbageNirvana> But like...lever action, man
[4:35:35] <Albedo28> spooky musak
[4:35:35] <+MrMcCrabby> shotgun and magnum is a solid loadout
[4:35:42] <stolando_florida> Lol
[4:35:42] <professormorrigan> well....
[4:35:46] <+AllenDeadman> btw pat, have you seen the demon slayer anime?
[4:35:50] <SoySocks> @star_feline just saw it on the netflix twitter account. called El Camino
[4:36:03] <%Arxel1> Wow, a fog door on that church LUL
[4:36:06] <+gatoralus> its a fog door so....
[4:36:08] <%arcaderabbit48> That is one of the most ominous fucking names Ive heard in a long time
[4:36:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Lever action guns are always cool
[4:36:11] <Mister_McDerp> root lady in church
[4:36:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Reminds me of bb guns
[4:36:22] <fearhurst> slog door
[4:36:31] <star_feline> I wanna shoot a lever action in real life now that I think about it
[4:36:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Especially when you spin 'em to chamber the next shot
[4:36:47] <%SergeantSov> Lever Actions are sick IRL too
[4:36:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @star_feline they are cool to shoot...just remember barrel safety
[4:36:54] <+gatoralus> my parents have several old timey rifles and they are cool
[4:36:59] <%Dakuu75> @Estuko oh yeah, we saw an enemy doing that a few minutes ago. shit was rad, lol
[4:36:59] <Tucker0603> HAMMER
[4:37:14] <%arcaderabbit48> The Mask
[4:37:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @angriestpat You missed some lore in the first room you ever warped to that is about to be relevant
[4:37:27] <%Estuko> @Dakuu75 I had a long rifle and pistole, that shit was NOT okay for me LUL
[4:37:31] <star_feline> @doc_ock_rokc don't worry safety is my LAST name
[4:37:33] <+gatoralus> try the hammer at some point, believe me its fun
[4:37:38] <fearhurst> lever action spinning is cool but if you do it around anyone they might kill you
[4:37:49] <+MrMcCrabby> the founders hideout has a secret room
[4:37:51] <@SSaryn> Was it the diary?
[4:37:54] <@SSaryn> I thought he got that
[4:38:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @fearhurst your more likely to kill yourself
[4:38:08] <@SSaryn> Oh ok.
[4:38:09] <@SSaryn> Well.
[4:38:09] <$drbuttss> a goddam fog door lol
[4:38:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> The other corkboard, and extra pages in the founder's secret room
[4:38:12] <%SergeantSov> Its about this next boss room

[4:38:33] <star_feline> That walk looks wrong
[4:38:35] <%Estuko> LUL
[4:38:36] <rytisone> now fight bloodstarved beast
[4:38:39] <+MrMcCrabby> the corkboard isnt really a big deal

[4:58:23] <Auriel_Astrum> an eye infection can make you go blind since your immune system doesn't recognise your eye as part of your body so it can make you go blind
[4:58:34] <%mostundesired> I unironically love the feeling of good $40 games
[4:58:42] <Mister_McDerp> kill all trees
[4:58:43] <Auriel_Astrum> so take your eyes seriously since your immune system won't xD
[4:58:43] <captainnathaniel> @AngriestPat this game has 100 plus enemy variations
[4:58:47] <%ChaosVulpes> Why are trees so evil?
[4:58:53] <%Dementedpenguin> apatDab ?
[4:59:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 Levels quickly cap out at 1500 XP per level, so maxing Elder Knowledge first is awesome. And jumping into other people's games, or rerolling, lets you get unlimited trait points from Tomes. There's usually like 1 tome per zone.

[4:59:37] <%thebeargoesHONK> Hey Pat. Does Paige enjoy the mustard ice cream?

[5:00:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, Pat, I just started playing REsident Evil 2 remake and I am purposely playing it the exact opposite of how you'd run it (I'm using consumables immediately, not rotating my saves, etc.) The pettiness of it all is empowering to me.
