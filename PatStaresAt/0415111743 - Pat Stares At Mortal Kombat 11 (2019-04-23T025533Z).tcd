[0:30:09] <%curlym0nster> creamy is superior
[0:30:09] <%Spiders4Brekfast> Peanut butter is the worst butter
[0:30:11] <leviathan666303> the correct answer is both
[0:30:12] <%rdark_ksu> ever had a peanut butter, banana and honey sandwich? that was my childhood to a T
[0:30:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> If I wanted chunky peanut butter, I'd eat peanuts

[0:32:19] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[0:32:23] <%brickwall35> LUL

[0:32:36] <VRNK> wouldnt canadian boomers just be boomers
[0:32:36] <lloyddboy> Pat Boomvin
[0:32:40] <televisedrevolting> One thing I agree with Pat 100% on is the fact that Ariel is the worst Disney Princess.
[0:32:40] <+Tennochief> the boomer term is being used incorrectly now
[0:32:41] <%Spiders4Brekfast> Kanji is totally into men tho
[0:32:43] <ArtThouBored> Oh my god that Sonic 06 Fandub Paige pointed people to on Twitter
[0:32:45] <+tiishi> mmm
[0:32:46] <Capn_Bilge> why settle for one when you can date them all? that's a healthy sentiment.
[0:32:48] <ArtThouBored> It's amazing
[0:32:48] <HeadsHeldHigh> I like Naoto but I hate cuckin my boi Kanji
[0:32:48] <VRNK> because that was the wwii vet children generation
[0:32:49] <majindusto> CHIE is SUPERIOR
[0:32:49] <+Dull_Fangs> Pats a 30 year old boomer
[0:32:54] <kingbaconcrispy> Isn't Pat a 30 year old bomer?
[0:32:55] <+Tennochief> people keep on using boomer to refer to people who are not boomers
[0:32:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat's a millennial, just like probably a large number of the people that are here.

[0:35:08] <xeros720> he's barely moving in this scene
[0:35:08] <gorillahandz> MK11 look better than 10 and 9 from the previews

[0:35:57] <%Albadabar> Pat are you gonna be able to make it? You sound like you died 2 hours ago
[0:36:00] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat why do i feel like this games story is just them justifying all the previous timetravel bullshit?
[0:36:02] <ArtThouBored> Being a huge idiot even
[0:36:07] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat what's your favorite MK?
[0:36:08] <Run44forrest> pachinko?
[0:36:16] <+Dull_Fangs> Well guess what this one has the exact same thing
[0:36:18] <coreybom> But this game has actually good animation
[0:36:20] <$RaikenTB> Pat's going to give us all dragon rot.
[0:36:20] <bendatron> @AngriestPat dont forget shujinko being the stupidest person ever

[0:36:21] <+omenzazu> sipsipElmo
[0:36:22] <+Lionkevinson> Shujinko
[0:36:22] <ArtThouBored> Shujinko is SO STUPID and gullible in Deception and that's your hero
[0:36:22] <GlootsforSloots> NRS games have really floaty animations with inconsistent weight and hitstun
[0:36:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Raiden did nothing wrong
[0:36:35] <televisedrevolting> Watch the Launch Trailer, Pat-boy.
[0:36:36] <Prism_Wing> III
[0:36:37] <ArtThouBored> Yeah brother
[0:36:39] <%Konquerer> I got 100% on all the ps2 mortal kombats and now question my life decisions
[0:36:41] <%GarbageNirvana> The PS2 era MK fighters were all chumps
[0:36:43] <ArtThouBored> MK2 IS the shit
[0:36:43] <Ion_Laser> Shujinko is dumb as fuck
[0:36:43] <$RubberFistFight> @Brother_Coduss it kind of is, but it's great anyway because MK is the dumbest kind of fun, or the funnest kind of dumb, there is. Always has been, always will be.
[0:36:45] <$DarkKnightGrave> Trilogy
[0:36:45] <%GohanEgret> MK3 for the stupid killer instinct style combos
[0:36:52] <%ennui_on_me> MK vs DC is the only one I've played and I'm sure that's the best one
[0:36:54] <%rdark_ksu> MK is dumb story wise. Like hey this is a literal God but its okay we can just punch it to death.....
[0:36:58] <+Dull_Fangs> The only good MK is UMK3

[0:37:05] <LiteralFraud> Pat you need to full reset your batteries
[0:37:05] <%Mornaka> @AngriestPat take a 30 minute power nap
[0:37:06] <arcaderabbit48> The worst part about Shujinko is that he can't even fight on his own, he just copies everyone else. Until he CAN fight on his own, and he's the worst fucking character in the game.
[0:37:08] <gustavozxd> gonna be a good day huh
[0:37:09] <%low_hell_key> christ he's like a malfunctioning robot

[0:48:55] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 people hate meatloaf. I just don't like existing. Hell, the only reason I'm still here is cause when I brought up the prospect of euthinasia to my parents when I was 12 or 14 or something, they started to bawl and do that ugly cry thing. I'm being GUILT TRIPPED into this shit, so now the only thing I can do is wait them out, make snide comments with my dark humor, and work on trying to expand self determination legislation. that, and when I have a really bad day, or

[0:52:43] <TheCrunge24> did you guys see the leak about rocksteadys new game being announced Friday?

[0:53:03] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[0:53:05] <sdgundum990> Did Anita Sarkeesian not make several videos about how women in video games are dressed too sexily and used MK as an example? Are they not dressing down their characters sexuality to appease those who agree with her sentiments?
[0:53:07] <antonius40k> @tennochief you're totally right. it's sad to know that feminism nowadays is doing more damage for women than any amount of good they could claim it's doing

[0:53:43] <+Ryutaryi> Thank you, Pat.
[0:53:43] <Nina96> @AngriestPat yeah but those DICKS THOUGH?

[0:53:44] <sjcodan> I disagree
[0:53:44] <%Konquerer> i've never liked any of the old designs anyway
[0:53:44] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow, I can't believe there are people unironically complaining about female characters in MK having less tiddy exposed LUL
[0:53:44] <%FrostMass22> Yeah, Sheeva looks great
[0:53:45] <+Haarute> Rare footage of Pat being right.
[0:53:46] <Sajallday> All the mk ladies are SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOD

[0:53:49] <DracaenaLeaf> Skarlet has a red hair alt it's all cool
[0:53:50] <soraabora> go play dead or alive if you want titties lmao
[0:53:50] <%ElenaManetta> Tits in a porn-filled internet world, who cares, you have unlimited supply, it's no longer a treat in video games or movies or tv shows
[0:53:50] <Neo_Kaiser> The problem is about the double standard.
[0:53:50] <StaticSunrise> they hated jesus because he spoke the truth
[0:53:51] <%deviljhojho94> Everyone literally looks the best it has ever been
[0:53:51] <Run44forrest> gamers rise up
[0:53:51] <HefestoForges> THANKS PAT PogChamp
[0:53:52] <Caidezes> Just go watch porn if you want tits.
[0:53:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> boooooooooo more tiddies
[0:53:52] <ArtThouBored> It's just people who grew up on MK9 being mad
[0:53:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Gotta have a good look at that boob while you're ripping it off of its owner right
[0:53:53] <%spiritofmojave> People are fucking stupid, especially in reference to that. Who sodding cares
[0:53:53] <+Promessa_EX> i do like titty tho and the designers don't seem to
[0:53:53] <%joylent_blue> MK women have historically had terrible terrible designs
[0:53:53] <+Tennochief> also they fucked up Jacqui
[0:53:53] <televisedrevolting> BIG COOL PAT HERE
[0:53:53] <Frodiddly> Turns out designing a character based around chest skin is not terribly interesting
[0:53:53] <%Jetsfantasy> Revenant tits DansGame
[0:53:55] <Frodiddly> SHOCKING
[0:53:55] <+krispen_wa> PURE CHRISTIAN PAT
[0:53:55] <%Typhaeon> I dunno about that, there are some I'm on board with
[0:53:56] <+PanicSwytch> Tig ol bitties
[0:53:56] <%RedMageRebel> with the exception of Cassie, I miss her old hair
[0:53:57] <%Bupkis7> You are super wrong Pat
[0:53:57] <+Tennochief> and Sheeva
[0:53:57] <+miguelrod777> porn exists of these characters just watch that
[0:53:57] <%JenovasPuppet> Even Frost?
[0:53:59] <%rdark_ksu> Jaqui briggs looks great
[0:54:00] <%IMDRanged> They couldn't come up with a good design, so show skin
[0:54:01] <RedNeptonic> but think of mah source filmaker porn
[0:54:01] <horsesaredumb> LUL
[0:54:02] <gustavozxd> Sonya looks lame though
[0:54:02] <soraabora> there are so many titties, just look at the dudes
[0:54:02] <+Tennochief> they fucked up SHeeva
[0:54:02] <%MegboyManuel> ungrateful shits =))))
[0:54:03] <+purps26> MK9 lady designs were so fucking bad
[0:54:04] <@lewdskeletor13> They don’t all wear the Sam skimpy bikinis now? Dangit, that was so original!
[0:54:04] <%deviljhojho94> even the ninjas look good
[0:54:04] <sjcodan> MK11 SHOULD RESPECT MY TIME AND ADD BiG ANIME TIDDIES
[0:54:05] <UnderpaidBob> Frost looks great
[0:54:05] <televisedrevolting> JUST SAYING THE THING
[0:54:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Here we go
[0:54:06] <%Kazooki_Kazami> Just make nude mods later jackasses
[0:54:06] <+DrunkenDice> go on alukardBAEgasm
[0:54:07] <%Dr_DangerPhD> MK character designs improve the more clothes you put on them, just like Dead or Alive
[0:54:07] <DXLelouch24> Kitanas hot, they have bad taste
[0:54:08] <starotter70> Nah, where's Sonia's vapor jacket tho
[0:54:09] <+cvp5127> just wait for pc mods LUL
[0:54:10] <+Tennochief> like holy shit Sheeva is terrible
[0:54:11] <coreybom> THANK YOU PAT!
[0:54:11] <+Anjogumi> Isn't that bit subjective though? Also the issue is that they're fine sexualizing men and having them half naked but not women?
[0:54:11] <gensoukaizou> why does sheeva look so bad
[0:54:12] <masso101> Oh no he’s being willfully ignorant that’s a shame
[0:54:12] <MarylandJutsu> 10 minutes to go
[0:54:12] <$RubberFistFight> @Kataguro Sonya's design is based on her MK3 design so there's already precedent there that invalidates the argument.
[0:54:13] <ArtThouBored> Kitana looked like ass in MK9 and I don't care what you guys say
[0:54:14] <Magnetgear> @deviljhojho94 more like sand flying in your face from out of nowhere just to prove a point
[0:54:14] <HeadsHeldHigh> I don't like the goggles on Skarlet's hood
[0:54:15] <TruTrashMan> It's almost like bare skin is not visually interesting from a character design perspective. ALMOST
[0:54:15] <sosuke5> But my anime tiddies though
[0:54:16] <Desertfishing> we should be able to cock slap people with johnny cages big ol dad dick
[0:54:18] <ArtThouBored> Her shitty ponytail
[0:54:18] <+Haarute> Sheeva is fantastic.
[0:54:18] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Jacui looks worse but she never looked good to begin with, from one kind of bland to another kind of bland, and Cassies MKX default is better, but the rest look great
[0:54:19] <%weissguard> Kitana looks like an ACTUAL Princess now! PogChamp @AngriestPat
[0:54:19] <CopperTucker> these designs are better honestly
[0:54:21] <%Birdigalore> Kitana had a fuckin' ape face in MK9
[0:54:21] <+cvit_> schrodinger's titties
[0:54:22] <Dral54> Get this quote ready
[0:54:22] <+Eclipse_knight_> i think thats more because the old designs were just terrible
[0:54:23] <@lewdskeletor13> The Perverts Argument LUL
[0:54:23] <Bakefowl> 😡 Why don’t my ninjas have the silicones 😡
[0:54:25] <+DrunkenDice> lol
[0:54:25] <starotter70> Ah god MK9 Designs!
[0:54:27] <zamzoph> MK9 faces LUL
[0:54:28] <televisedrevolting> Hard cut to that ProZD video
[0:54:30] <Dragon_Batman> Skarlet is the huge 180 from 9 to 11
[0:54:31] <%Konquerer> man face all over in that
[0:54:31] <ArtThouBored> No her hair IS THE WORST in MK9
[0:54:32] <%Typhaeon> MK9 had the opposite problem
[0:54:33] <UnderpaidBob> They gave Kitana bad bitch energy
[0:54:33] <sdgundum990> I don't disagree with the designs being good. I'm saying there is a point to the devs doing so beyond aesthetics.
[0:54:35] <%TheMilhouseExperience> DOA sold really well, right?! Right?!
[0:54:36] <Dr_Mooose> don't, don't look at the face
[0:54:36] <%MegboyManuel> I want my fake 3D boob's cause I can't get tits IRL
[0:54:38] <alphapneumatic> especially the netherworld people
[0:54:39] <%deviljhojho94> @Magnetgear Time is the pocket sand of god
[0:54:41] <HoIlywood_SN> she has a dog face in MK9
[0:54:42] <%ennui_on_me> Any move away from total eye candy is apparently SJW propaganda
[0:54:43] <ArtThouBored> Her chunky ass ponytail
[0:54:45] <%fFailureatlife> @sdgundum990 who cares
[0:54:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> T I D D I E S ( . Y . )
[0:54:46] <StrikeTheGiant> romans wrestle naked
[0:54:47] <%Mev852_> Mev852_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 7 months of Yakuzies, fighting games, and Vampire bullshit. Looking forward to what's coming up.
[0:54:49] <gorillahandz> SHE'S HOT IN MK11
[0:54:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@VektorTroika) (warning)
[0:54:53] <gustavozxd> focus the attraction on the body so people don't look at her face
[0:54:53] <$RubberFistFight> Most of the fucking crybaby having a tantrum over "too much clothing" aren't even fucking MK fans, jesus. I've been bashing away at the games since the arcade cab of the VERY FIRST GAME EVER, and I think the new costume designs are fucken dope.
[0:54:54] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Originally, all MK girls were 80percent titties and 19percent body, 1 percent face
[0:54:54] <%RedMageRebel> The asian people actually look like Asians!
[0:54:55] <%deviljhojho94> I like milena face from before MKX Keepo
[0:54:55] <%colouroftheiris77> Sonya's design is cool. Too bad they cast a transphobe asswipe to voice her.
[0:54:55] <dagreenpillow> fOr tHe BoNeR cUlTuRe
[0:54:56] <%FrostMass22> It isn't just about them getting covered up, it's the reason why.
[0:54:57] <Caidezes> LUL
[0:54:57] <Frodiddly> Remember when Kitana poledanced as her victory move; that was embarrassing
[0:54:58] <Magnetgear> @deviljhojho94 amen brother

[0:55:04] <%rdark_ksu> you and your bitches pat
[0:55:04] <Dral54> What it lacks in core valued it has it in character design
[0:55:05] <zamzoph> STEP ON ME?
[0:55:05] <%Typhaeon> Oh, so it's a fetish-based argument LuL
[0:55:05] <%Reaped_Psyche> Agreed
[0:55:07] <gustavozxd> YES YES YES
[0:55:07] <%IMDRanged> YEP
[0:55:07] <HeadsHeldHigh> THERE IT IS
[0:55:07] <%ThePuddingDead> its subjective dude
[0:55:07] <%Albadabar> Pat gets it
[0:55:08] <%Bupkis7> NO IT'S NOT
[0:55:08] <mayorrev> lmao
[0:55:09] <HefestoForges> she is an actual character now
[0:55:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no
[0:55:10] <Ion_Laser> YES
[0:55:10] <%mercado94> @TheMilhouseExperience which one? DOA6 or VEnus
[0:55:11] <gorillahandz> Like this ain't even a matter of prudeness, she's just straight up way more attractive like that
[0:55:11] <+RoboBro1212> my man
[0:55:11] <+combomaniadeluxe> the only problem I have with the redesigns is that they all look like entirely different people from game to game
[0:55:12] <+Tennochief> @Frodiddly I think you mean nice
[0:55:12] <+Shastafield> Kreygasm
[0:55:12] <%ElenaManetta> iF ONLY THEY PUT A TiNY HAT ON HER, SHE'D BE MEGA HOT FOR PAT

[0:55:18] <%Kataguro> @RubberFistFight It still doesn't look very good, even if it's a throwback. I would say Jax looks bad if he was black and yellow gangsta Jax
[0:55:19] <CopperTucker> more clothes is hotter
[0:55:19] <worldbrand> We could use a few more ribbed sweaters than bikinis anyway
[0:55:20] <%yoshkosh20> the girls shown so far look fuckin great and cool. but I'm gonna miss the silly dumb bikinis because the shlockiness was silly
[0:55:20] <%weissguard> She looks GREAT.

[0:55:31] <Tooniearcade> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:55:32] <sdgundum990> Some people do care. I dont even have the system to play it on, and clearly there are those who disagree with the direction.
[0:55:32] <%Sora20030c> This is the most correct I have ever seen Pat
[0:55:32] <Antrodox> show feet
[0:55:33] <%FrostMass22> Pat, that isn't the argument.
[0:55:33] <ArtThouBored> You can see lewd shit on the internet bro
[0:55:35] <sjcodan> They made the tiddies smaller, and that's unforgivable
[0:55:35] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Pixel skin I might add
[0:55:35] <%Finalzero0> Pat is right
[0:55:35] <%deviljhojho94> WHAT ABOUT MILENA , BRING BACk HER HUGE FANGS
[0:55:35] <%Ranryu692> Tell 'em, Pat!
[0:55:36] <%spiritofmojave> It's persona that makes people get horny on main, not just skin-fare
[0:55:37] <%fFailureatlife> PAT IS SO RIGHT
[0:55:38] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> People are dumb, man
[0:55:38] <+Anjogumi> It's not about that though, it's about still having half naked men and sexualizing them but females HAVE TO BE covered up.
[0:55:39] <+QuadraticGravity> Real Patricians get off on vore these days
[0:55:40] <ArtThouBored> Like why
[0:55:40] <%hussdogrob> @screamingmeat trueeeeee
[0:55:40] <%ennui_on_me> Bayonetta's covered up, can't believe they're censoring that game so much
[0:55:40] <T_Sasquatch> pat come on , people have different tastes and you have your taste
[0:55:40] <MelancholicMasochist> I just want smoke back :c
[0:55:40] <%ElenaManetta> I like lewd skin, but only if it's detached from the person. apatWhat
[0:55:41] <%Reaped_Psyche> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:55:41] <Madbearv> its censorship when it offends MY interests
[0:55:41] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat the MK9 women all look like gorilla people with fucked up dog faces
[0:55:42] <%lord_hades> cover dem titties
[0:55:42] <Zombrocom> So it's just fetish wars for you people huh
[0:55:43] <$RaikenTB> For shame, Patrick.
[0:55:43] <ReedphariusOmegon> it's what separates the boys from the connoisseurs
[0:55:43] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat pat explaining his fetish is making my unconfortable NomNom NomNom NomNom
[0:55:43] <televisedrevolting> Femdom is the fucking hottest and no one can dissuade me otherwise!
[0:55:43] <HefestoForges> who ordered GINGER ROAST
[0:55:43] <$SGrim> Skin isn't even necessary. Aria from KI is more than proof of that rooGasm
[0:55:44] <oAznoUta> you'd think they figured out after flesh pit Mileena that they weren't selling to 12 year olds anymore
[0:55:44] <Nina96> @AngriestPat u shoudnt be surprised pat
[0:55:44] <auraofdawn> THANK YOU PAT

[0:55:46] <@lewdskeletor13> Pats never been more right
[0:55:47] <antonius40k> yeah won't she's a queen so she shouldn't be dressed in a bikini. I get the whole warrior woman thing but come on guys if you don't think she still looks hot then you're delusional and just go watch hentai
[0:55:48] <%Keeble24> anime tiddies be selling since the beginning of time lol

[0:55:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> like you
[0:55:49] <gorillahandz> like this ain't Sony censoring Trish's buttcrack in DMC5, its just better character design
[0:55:50] <%Konquerer> only REPTILE is hot and that's the way it has always been

[0:55:54] <starotter70> It's true
[0:55:54] <Run44forrest> remember pat can only get off to hats now
[0:55:54] <$RaikenTB> Fuck off, Pat LUL
[0:55:55] <thewhiterice92> Do not speak with troglodytes
[0:55:56] <gensoukaizou> her mk 10 outfit is way better
[0:55:57] <+iamwood99> there’s so much porn in the internet why are they getting off to character models
[0:55:57] <%FrostMass22> Nice strawman but okay
[0:55:57] <+Tennochief> seriously they fucked up SHeeva
[0:55:58] <$RubberFistFight> @FrostMass22 As long as the argument is "the game is shit because I can't see nipples and puss through her bikini" then I'll gatekeep as hard as I goddamn want.
[0:55:58] <SubjectX07x> Normally I'm on the side of people like TheQuartering but even I agree the whining over these changes is just dumb.
[0:55:58] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat, that's not the argument.
[0:55:59] <gustavozxd> he's not wrong
[0:56:00] <ArtThouBored> Pretty much. It always comes down to taste
[0:56:00] <Desertfishing> Don't lie you wanna see a nude johnny cage

[0:56:00] <%IMDRanged> shoutSiltom apatDab shoutSilcr
[0:56:01] <%deviljhojho94> Its like the xenoblade 2 tighs argument
[0:56:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 watch they just reallocated all the creepy sexy design points into what is essentially just a massive sentient pair of tits. Pat's right though, I'm ace and can say clothes look better than the people in them.
[0:56:02] <%nofestu2> But tits tho

[0:56:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> k, por que no los dos
[0:56:05] <%DigitalJoshie> but Pat titties are more important than good design
[0:56:05] <clockworkblues> Who the fuck even cares play your games and move on
[0:56:06] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Depravity breeds more depravity

[0:56:06] <televisedrevolting> ASK NOT THE EAGLE
[0:56:07] <T_Sasquatch> i dont care but you are literally just saying your sexual attraction is better than others
[0:56:09] <ArtThouBored> Sonya looked shit in MK9 too
[0:56:10] <haveswordmuststing> Most of the characters are deep as a puddle, not even a kiddie pool, so the tiddy is the only defining feature to most of them

[0:56:16] <jastrouble97> sorry we aren't all old like you but for real your right
[0:56:17] <majindusto> Bring back Mileena tho

[0:56:17] <BatmanPortal05> Not the argument or not, he is right

[0:56:19] <ArtThouBored> Her titvest without a tanktop
[0:56:19] <Senselessvirus> I personally like the new designs
[0:56:19] <ReedphariusOmegon> wait, fuck, was pat just RIGHT about something?

[0:56:33] <+Anjogumi> It's not about not having boobs, it's about sexualizing men but female characters get covered up.

[0:56:33] <%ElenaManetta> pat STOLE THAT MAN'S BIRTHDAY
[0:56:34] <%ennui_on_me> Every time there's an outrage over making the sexy video game girls less sexy now it's just the most mind-numbing shit
[0:56:34] <%FrostMass22> @rubberfistfight You're doing a good job fighting that strawman. It's nice to see that "it's fine when I do it."
[0:56:34] <%fFailureatlife> Pat was literally the most right hes ever been
[0:56:35] <sdgundum990> It isn't about the designs. It's about the devs berating people who disagree with them. That's the whole point.

[0:56:38] <artoflec> but real answer, if they wanted to show skin, they could, but they're frankly not good enough designers to make skin show nad it not look boring either

[0:56:49] <+Anjogumi> Pat is missing the entire point LUL
[0:56:50] <masso101> Pat it’s not about them being hot, and I think you know that. The character designer had no reason to go out of their way to be like “huhuh you mysoge therapists don’t get your anime tiddies nana nana boo boo”
[0:56:50] <$RubberFistFight> @yoshkosh20 most of the character redesigns are but these crusty thirsty shits see anything that has more fabric than a handkerchief and lose their minds.

[0:57:38] <kingbaconcrispy> I think Pat misinterates the argument. Yeah there's people who only want tits but I think an argument can be made about the designs just being lame. Kitana is the only female in that game that looks cool in part due to her attitude. She's the only one who doesn't feel like a background character. Her and Frost and maybe Dvora.

[0:57:56] <oAznoUta> when the fuck did the character designer say that? DansGame
[0:57:57] <ScreamingMeat> My concern is. Are they covering the girls up more because they like the designs they came up with, or to avoid outrage from people that don't even play MK? If it's the former then fair enough, more power to them. if it's the later then they're sellouts

[0:59:36] <+Tennochief> us marines coming to fuck Prince Harry's butt
[0:59:37] <%FrostMass22> @rubberfistfight All the men are still sexualised.
[0:59:39] <%Verd_254> Let the designers make what the want. Whether it's outrage culture or "boner culture" all these demands are stupid imo.
[0:59:41] <+Internet_Jorge> 5 MINUTES!
[0:59:41] <televisedrevolting> Wait fuck wrong guy, damn.
[0:59:46] <ArtThouBored> I love when people compare Baraka as sexy to justify their argument. Y'all lying motherfuckers don't see Baraka the way I do

[0:59:58] <masso101> Don’t get me wrong people, I don’t give a shit, the designs are fine, but I take issue with creators shitting on their fanbases, I don’t care what the reason is.

[1:00:17] <kingbaconcrispy> @RubberFistFight Ok let me rephrase that. The guys who only want titties are dumb, but I think people are well in their right to not like the designs for other reasons then tits. Don't just assume I'm mad because he has a different opinion. Actually attack my argument.

[1:00:33] <MelancholicMasochist> senran kagura is good tho
[1:00:34] <%Kataguro> It is pretty goofy for the character designer to say how they're trying to give all the characters outfits that are functional and not sexualized when half the male cast is shirtless and Shao Khan is fucking STACKED

[1:07:55] <%Jetsfantasy> MK on pad is pretty normal
[1:07:55] <starotter70> With a Kontroler?
[1:07:55] <%JenovasPuppet> Look at Frost in the Character Lessons screen like she's actually available
[1:07:55] <%ORGANizerC> mash all the buttons to fatality
[1:07:56] <+xx123manxx> Thats how it be
[1:07:57] <T_Sasquatch> there is NO reason why frost is locked
[1:07:57] <%wizkid50000> MK is designed for Kontroller use
[1:07:59] <+Zidi0s> Well sonic fox plays with a controller so w/e
[1:07:59] <ArtThouBored> Works better on controller
[1:08:00] <+solzan2000> yea MK11 is made for pad
[1:08:00] <%bearrier_> mk on stick is suffering
[1:08:02] <%Kanax55> Yikes
[1:08:02] <%TheMilhouseExperience> She’s shinnok

[1:08:23] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer100 quit whining you babies, day 1 dlc is fine. i'm not gonna explain it to you, go watch the extra credits video on it
[1:08:23] <%AllyBeeBoo> it looks so slow
[1:08:23] <%spiritofmojave> Sound is tight
[1:08:26] <physicaldepression> you can get her for free by playing the story
[1:08:26] <%Kazooki_Kazami> sound good
[1:08:26] <@lewdskeletor13> Sound good
[1:08:27] <dekkitout> Jump around

[1:08:30] <Ordinaryknight> No, consume dlc then get excited for new dlc
[1:08:31] <BoneofMalkav> Sounds good
[1:08:31] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Sounds like Banjo Kazooie life pickups
[1:08:36] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> Hey, Pat. Did you hear about how character loadouts are not set to the tournament legal versions
[1:08:36] <+aslfrasle> it's all in the mind!
[1:08:38] <Run44forrest> jank
[1:08:40] <artoflec> Max is stuck because the game is trying to hit the servers and the server is down elaSmile
[1:08:40] <%Kataguro> These animations really are kind of ass
[1:08:41] <+801braxton> Oh wow
[1:08:41] <Ordinaryknight> Frost does look great though
[1:08:44] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it's extremely fast, man.
[1:08:45] <+16BitAndUp> UE3
[1:08:51] <+RoboBro1212> nice to see MK not feeling like sludge I guess
[1:08:52] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat i swear i thought subzero was frost cuz his sides are visible like to show sideboob
[1:08:55] <+Tennochief> Sub Zero us hardly moving
[1:08:59] <Nina96> the stupid stance shit is still there?
[1:08:59] <%Dr_DangerPhD> yeah its def better than MKX
[1:09:01] <+16BitAndUp> Input lag is low.
[1:09:04] <%deviljhojho94> looks fine and dandy
[1:09:04] <+Haarute> this game's great
[1:09:06] <%terminallyCapriciousz> I don't like that Scorpion OR Sub-Zero costume
[1:09:06] <%LozsCat> its amazing
[1:09:07] <+Hamblasto> He doesn't want to make a stick with a centered block button
[1:09:08] <%ennui_on_me> Yeah this game looks damn good
[1:09:09] <Ion_Laser> Great Graphics
[1:09:10] <T_Sasquatch> game is pretty
[1:09:10] <Dragon_Batman> Yea this game looks amazing
[1:09:10] <%Konquerer> i see a compressed stream
[1:09:10] <%IMDRanged> 4K
[1:09:13] <sdgundum990> @Kirby_Sauce Right, the same guys with the worst takes on the internet. lmao
[1:09:14] <%spiritofmojave> It looks real good for PS4
[1:09:15] <gorillahandz> watch Scorpion come to Smash and have the greatest animation he's ever had
[1:09:15] <%IHATREID> is this game 30 or 60
[1:09:16] <@lewdskeletor13> I know nothing about the gameplay, I’ve only seen the story mode
[1:09:19] <%FrostMass22> Image quality is really high so you get to see Sheeva's man facr
[1:09:21] <%AncelDeLambert> ... does Subzero look wierd to anyone else?
[1:09:21] <%Jetsfantasy> 4k doesn't necessarily need AA though
[1:09:22] <%yoshkosh20> get it on pc for the eventual nude mods
[1:09:22] <missingangle> Yeah this looks great
[1:09:24] <horsesaredumb> ps4pro?
[1:09:25] <+solzan2000> PS4 version is geat
[1:09:25] <jamesofn> @IHATREID 60
[1:09:28] <majindusto> Muh Jaggies
[1:09:29] <%RedMageRebel> I dig this sub-zero actually
[1:09:31] <+Tennochief> I like the older costumes better
[1:09:33] <Capn_Bilge> jaggies aren't in until the Monster Hunter crossover
[1:09:36] <+801braxton> Fighting games are always 60
[1:09:36] <%cappyd33> did you get pc or ps4?
[1:09:37] <sjcodan> Big clunky
[1:09:38] <%Kravedarknesss> I find it amazing that its running on ue3
[1:09:39] <ScreamingMeat> Scorpion and Sub-Zero look fucking awesome in this!
[1:09:39] <rubbishbinge> Jaggies are MH my guy
[1:09:39] <MasterTonberry23> Hey, I'm a refugee from Max's stream because he's only letting subs talk right now
[1:09:39] <+Tennochief> Sub in MKX is top tier
[1:09:39] <%BayowolfTerra> 30 for cutscenes, I think
[1:09:39] <ArtThouBored> Sheeva always looked manface-y
[1:09:40] <%AncelDeLambert> he looks, I dunno, deflated or something
[1:09:40] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> we might have better netcode Pat. don't count out pc yet
[1:09:40] <%ORGANizerC> now play it on switch :^)
[1:09:43] <rattler123> J U M P S
[1:09:43] <%yeknomlive> pc could also be kursed like the last one was for awhile
[1:09:45] <%IMDRanged> Hopefully I don't need a PS4 Pro if PS5 should be backwards to all PS4 hopefully.
[1:09:45] <sdgundum990> @Kirby_Sauce You dont have to qualify your statements why should I? lol
[1:09:46] <Nina96> thats pretty fancy for ps4 its pro right?
[1:09:53] <+Shaggnar> Nah, 4k needs at least 2x aa
[1:09:55] <+Grayhammatter> CLICK
[1:09:55] <+Tennochief> nice
[1:09:57] <fairore> @frostmass22 steve is hurt by this
[1:10:04] <rattler123> CLICK
[1:10:06] <SpaceGuntank> clicky noise?
[1:10:06] <%ElenaManetta> Why is that SIGNIFICANT!!!
[1:10:06] <danknugglit> Mk amsr
[1:10:07] <Dragon_Batman> kool
[1:10:07] <Dr_Mooose> the future is now!
[1:10:08] <ArtThouBored> No seriously Sheeva doesn't have a good record of being attractive
[1:10:09] <dekkitout> That's ADORABLE
[1:10:11] <missingangle> Clicky click
[1:10:11] <$RubberFistFight> ok this is great, scorps and subbie look like their lineage suggests they should, for fucking once.
[1:10:12] <%ORGANizerC> *click*
[1:10:12] <%yeknomlive> like tekken?
[1:10:13] <%Kataguro> It is?
[1:10:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm lost, why clicky important?
[1:10:18] <+solzan2000> PS5 will have ps4 settings for sure
[1:10:19] <+RoboBro1212> Tekken 7 had htat, great feature
[1:10:19] <+Shinmaddrox> Sound que for combos
[1:10:20] <%spiritofmojave> Those clicks are going to be satisfying to hear
[1:10:20] <+xx123manxx> that clicking noise sounds like when your nose is stuffed
[1:10:23] <SchroedingersFerret> Pat do combo
[1:10:24] <%IMDRanged> His PS4 controller speaker making noice?
[1:10:26] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> Klicky nois
[1:10:28] <haveswordmuststing> oh thats some Skullgirls tier QoL
[1:10:28] <DrkJP520> Tekken does noises too, right?
[1:10:29] <TruTrashMan> Klicky noises are always good
[1:10:30] <Dehlome> makes timing much clearer
[1:10:32] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Do kombo
[1:10:33] <ScreamingMeat> It shows you the timing to which is great
[1:10:38] <%yoshkosh20> @ArtThouBored she got four arms. she don't need to be attractive
[1:10:43] <+drshull> Do the combo
[1:10:45] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Ps5 more like ps4.5
[1:10:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> max did combo
[1:10:52] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, okay
[1:10:53] <%Jetsfantasy> Blazblue had this problem early on
[1:10:54] <MarylandJutsu> there ya go
[1:10:54] <+801braxton> it lets you get a grasp of the timing
[1:10:55] <+Tennochief> nice
[1:10:56] <%yeknomlive> timing is everything. clicks help learning and remembering so much easier
[1:10:57] <%spiritofmojave> It helps develop a good rhythm
[1:10:57] <%AncelDeLambert> "Kompleted" oh no
[1:10:58] <invisi_bliss> doesn't tekken do that?
[1:10:58] <%FrostMass22> @artthoubored I'm glad they upped the ugly factor. That's no moon, that's Sheeva's face but they're equally round
[1:10:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> I don't hear it
[1:10:59] <+drshull> Just do the combo
[1:11:00] <leviathan666303> for honor has a really good version of this @AngriestPat
[1:11:01] <+Shastafield> kool
[1:11:01] <Botman_R> So, who did they get to scab to replace Patrick Seitz for Scorpion?
[1:11:02] <%ennui_on_me> That's super good for new players
[1:11:04] <+Shinmaddrox> Sound Ques for correct timing for Combos to land
[1:11:05] <Dragon_Batman> The timing is always the hardest thing to find out in combos in my opinion
[1:11:08] <%ennui_on_me> Might have to pick this up now
[1:11:09] <+RushUnplugged> I do love the random K's in words
[1:11:14] <%Mornaka> How was that NOT kancel/ konfirm
[1:11:14] <+801braxton> block button :(
[1:11:14] <%patriotrenegade> blocking disabled
[1:11:15] <haveswordmuststing> @TheMilhouseExperience you mean shadily made PC Kappa
[1:11:16] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat Elmo is greatest Kat
[1:11:21] <deafmutelaughing> I'm angry whenever I see the letter c in this game they should all be replaced with K's
[1:11:24] <%laserbeaming> so, those attacks were all universal?
[1:11:26] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Mortal ELLLLLMMMMMOOOOOO
[1:11:26] <%Prevot> I'm concerned for anyone who found Sheeva attractive at any point
[1:11:27] <%AncelDeLambert> @Mornaka LUL
[1:11:28] <alexandrecau> at least in the past sheeva looked like a woman, here I think it's the armor having breast
[1:11:31] <Dr_Mooose> get low
[1:11:34] <danknugglit> Low hits low 4Head
[1:11:35] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @numbertoobig Yes
[1:11:40] <+Promessa_EX> why not duck all the time
[1:11:41] <%RedMageRebel> Yo are there any vietnamese characters in fighting games? I just realized Scorpion (and like half of Street Fighter) is Japenese, Sub is Chinese, theres that korean crazy chick in SF
[1:11:42] <T_Sasquatch> they spelt common with a c , BOOO
[1:11:47] <%Kirby_Sauce> @deafmutelaughing SKorpion
[1:11:48] <%yoshkosh20> all the sounds are so chunky. I love it
[1:11:51] <%Ranryu692> rofl
[1:11:51] <BigCoffee> why does scropion have a kunai and a katana?
[1:11:51] <%Hilleltaco> They're not doing that weird swaying stance so that's good
[1:11:52] <%AncelDeLambert> which one is Sheeva, and why does she have the same name as a Warframe knife?
[1:11:53] <%RedMageRebel> would be nice to see a Viet person in a game
[1:11:54] <%BayowolfTerra> I really do think think Sheeva looks that bad. Though I only saw the one picture
[1:11:54] <jamesofn> @AngriestPat you gonna get some games with woolie going later?
[1:11:55] <%thelonechris> Bop
[1:11:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Are we gonna have to deal with whiny people on chat all night?
[1:12:00] <%marsano168> This is one chonky game
[1:12:03] <ArtThouBored> Sheeva is the four armed woman
[1:12:03] <alcors_wisdom> so i know fuck all about fighting games does 60 frames make combos better or worse
[1:12:05] <Run44forrest> wtf that was an overhead?
[1:12:07] <+arzeniccatnip> Yeah man
[1:12:08] <%patriotrenegade> sub mode incoming
[1:12:08] <+Dull_Fangs> Like this is a 3D fighter
[1:12:09] <KazMkII> Animations seems like a real improvement Kappa // Netherrealm
[1:12:11] <+Hamblasto> Hold the button in the middle of your other buttons
[1:12:12] <%Sora20030c> fuzzy guarding wooo
[1:12:16] <starotter70> @lewdskeletor13 Yes
[1:12:18] <fairore> @bayowolfterra its worse in motion
[1:12:22] <sjcodan> You guys see they changed Johnny
[1:12:27] <+Promessa_EX> and it probably avoid grabs
[1:12:31] <Capn_Bilge> i will literally never be able to block on reaction to the different heights...
[1:12:33] <+Dull_Fangs> Fuzzy guard
[1:12:33] <%yoshkosh20> sweep the leg
[1:12:37] <+Tennochief> nice
[1:12:38] <haveswordmuststing> @alcors_wisdom more responsive, but more maths if you want frame data
[1:12:40] <%marsano168> I am down for all of this
[1:12:41] <starotter70> Krazy
[1:12:45] <%Sora20030c> mids and lows get blocked on low
[1:12:49] <%Mornaka> kontrols
[1:12:49] <KazMkII> @AngriestPat Why the gotta always beat up Sub Zero
[1:12:50] <42nfl19> Do they still have the each character has 3 styles thing? @AngriestPat
[1:12:51] <%Sora20030c> overheads and jumps blocked by standing
[1:12:52] <%AncelDeLambert> ... interact?
[1:12:53] <+Promessa_EX> mids should hit blocks imo
[1:12:54] <Dehlome> Interact? in MK?
[1:12:54] <Dragon_Batman> Backround stuff
[1:12:54] <TruTrashMan> Stage hazards is my guess
[1:12:55] <sjcodan> He was making the OK sign, and aparently thats a alt-right thing now?
[1:12:57] <+Tennochief> ???
[1:12:57] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> rpg?
[1:12:58] <%ORGANizerC> because there's stage hazards in mk
[1:12:58] <%Kduff89> stage hazzards
[1:12:59] <UnfilteredComic> Background shit
[1:13:00] <lloyddboy> barrels
[1:13:01] <coreybom> Please put this chat insub mode
[1:13:02] <rattler123> Interact?
[1:13:03] <%Sora20030c> the latter two are much slower and you can usaully react to
[1:13:03] <+Promessa_EX> mids should hits ducking imo i mean
[1:13:04] <%Hilleltaco> Always with the weird interactables
[1:13:04] <%Jetsfantasy> There's stage weapons and hazards
[1:13:05] <+Shinmaddrox> Stage hazards
[1:13:05] <%Laecerelius> Gotta throw those pigs, Pat!

[1:13:47] <+Promessa_EX> is that my man steve blum
[1:13:48] <%Kataguro> Shove
[1:13:48] <alcors_wisdom> @NumberTooBig isnt high level play all about frame perfect combos and therefore frame data? does that make high level play preventitive or does is learning it not actually that hard
[1:13:49] <Capn_Bilge> this game sounds like injustice but wetter
[1:13:49] <+Scevda> Hi steve blum
[1:13:50] <GlootsforSloots> guys he knows what interact is he's asking why R1 which is way more useful and accessible is interact while throw is L1
[1:13:50] <%yoshkosh20> aw yeah. shitty one liners
[1:13:55] <+Promessa_EX> he bacc
[1:13:56] <%ElenaManetta> WOAH

[1:14:00] <asd2897> did...did subzero just say snow honor>
[1:14:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Now is Scorpion teleporting or just moving super fast?
[1:14:01] <@lewdskeletor13> Of course Sub Zero is Blum
[1:14:05] <%Konquerer> when is it not steve blum
[1:14:06] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat ohhhh you're gonna LOVE some of the stuff that happens in story mode. also, negative edging is on by default - dunno if you like it on or off, worth checking.
[1:14:07] <%ORGANizerC> snowed under
[1:14:07] <%Kataguro> Snowed Under
[1:14:07] <UnderpaidBob> is this always how throw breaks have worked in MK?
[1:14:08] <%crimsonharvest> "snowed under"
[1:14:09] <%yoshkosh20> snowed under

[1:15:54] <jamesofn> how is he alive then? wouldnt scorpion kill him wasnt that his whole deal
[1:15:54] <MangoCoal01> Sub-Zero beat Scorpion once in MK9.

[1:16:09] <%nekodelic> sub-zero won one in the cartoon
[1:16:11] <%rdark_ksu> well he is kinda the face of the franchise
[1:16:11] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Pat the first time they fought Sub-Zero ripped his head off
[1:16:13] <ScreamingMeat> I'd figure Noob Saibot would be his fav
[1:16:14] <%RedMageRebel> Shao Kahn in this talks about how Sub Zero beat Scorpions ass
[1:16:15] <flubber3d> sub-zerp is the number of wins he has against scorpion
[1:16:16] <nature_hoot> Scorpion is the Triple H of Mortal Kombat
[1:16:17] <+Fortrify_Streager> Oh shit the Nagitama is back from Silent Hill
[1:16:19] <T_Sasquatch> sub zero doesnt have chance against scorpion tho
[1:16:20] <benjiFG> fancy

[1:16:22] <Jrhakim> @arcaderabbit48 go watch the Frost trailer you'll enjoy what it implies
[1:16:22] <Infamous_Reason4U> he beat him in MK9 and Mythologies
[1:16:24] <fussyfukc> scorp is eds hasbando
[1:16:25] <%Kataguro> Cartoon isn't canon since Jax wasn't a fat kid
[1:16:25] <%cappyd33> maybe the lin kuei just suck
[1:16:25] <Rellim80> Sub 1 bodied Scorps son though.

[1:16:32] <redial_nick> i guess he made the sub-zero game bad as a joke.
[1:16:33] <Antecursor> I thought the whole reason scorpion was dead in the first place is because the original sub zero killed him
[1:16:33] <px120> Are we not counting off screen stuff
[1:16:34] <Halospaz117> Younger Sub-Zero won in MK9

[1:16:51] <ShinobiPhoenix> Mk9 and Mythologies, because it was his game
[1:16:52] <%ElenaManetta> What is that prompt
[1:16:52] <+intjperspective> Scorpion hates sub zero bodied him in their first fight
[1:16:53] <%ElenaManetta> Holding?
[1:16:54] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat older Sub-Zero ripped Scorpions head off and younger Sub-Zero won in a fight in MK9s story mode, you are super wrong
[1:16:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> @HoIlywood_SN I think that was a different Sub-Zero.
[1:16:57] <+Tennochief> it's really good
[1:16:58] <+Grayhammatter> yo, that's tight
[1:17:01] <+thehoboacrossts> PogChamp
[1:17:02] <MangoCoal01> Sub-Zero beat Scorpion once in MK9, but before he could kill Scorpion, he got captured by the Cyber Lin Kuei.
[1:17:02] <alexandrecau> @Antecursor nope, wasn't even sub zero that killed his family it was quan chi
[1:17:02] <%TheCrispyBoi> ohh that's good
[1:17:03] <HoIlywood_SN> @rumtumtugnutz still Sub-Zero
[1:17:04] <%kenpachi9211> pat stop well your ahead

[1:17:06] <Capn_Bilge> damn, a tutorial where they actually gave a shit!
[1:17:07] <+arcturusblade> Wow, they actually put a lot of effort in the tutorial for this
[1:17:08] <Mutanthunter> You defeat scorpion as sub zero in mk9
[1:17:11] <+RoboBro1212> those timers are fucking cool
[1:17:13] <@lewdskeletor13> No you got it backwards, Scorpion killed The original Sub Zero
[1:17:14] <pipboy344> @stemloswater No
[1:17:15] <Madbearv> Well I mean
[1:17:17] <%Jetsfantasy> Nice that they give you some starter strings
[1:17:19] <+xx123manxx> They took out everything that made me like MK for this game so I just watched the story mode
[1:17:20] <%Radregice_> is this new metet system any good
[1:17:23] <%Radregice_> *meter
[1:17:23] <Dementedpenguin> @stemloswater only just went in tutorial for now

[1:17:45] <%BayowolfTerra> @lewdskeletor13 it was a tit for tat thing. they killed each other
[1:17:46] <%yoshkosh20> isn't this game technically a weapon fighter now? like soul calibur?
[1:17:46] <Desertfishing> ha countered
[1:17:52] <%ennui_on_me> Yeah, this tutorial seems super welcoming. I'm interested in learning this game now.
[1:17:53] <+Answer_Moose> Can you kombo his spear from his chain?
[1:17:54] <TruTrashMan> The biggest obstacle for me getting into fighting games was learning that you had to press the next button in the combo before the animation had the guys fist actually touch your opponent. I'm glad people jumping into this don't have to suffer like that
[1:17:56] <%Niney_Who> Use your EX's pat

[1:18:54] <%deviljhojho94> kiryu

[1:19:13] <@Fuggins4U> yo this is sick
[1:19:13] <deafmutelaughing> it's pretty unrealistic that they're stabbing each other and it doesn't instantly kill or at least seriously wound them
[1:19:14] <%Sora20030c> oh man

[1:19:21] <%Jetsfantasy> Frost's Fatal Move is the most ridiculous IMO, it's just a fatality
[1:19:23] <MangoCoal01> @spiritofmojave But he totally has killed people. The first Sub-Zero for example.
[1:19:23] <@lewdskeletor13> Fuggins apatGib

[1:19:40] <+KuroTendouSouji> this suits the clits
[1:19:41] <arcaderabbit48> I really like almost every part of that Frost trailer except the part where her head is a weapon. That's just dumb

[1:20:14] <deafmutelaughing> T_Sasquatch that sounds like the opposite of "mortal"!
[1:20:16] <%ElenaManetta> It's really late at night and there's something about replacing all words that start with "C" with "K" that's making me laugh
[1:20:17] <T_Sasquatch> you people forget that if someone is a guest chracter, you have to be okay with seeing that chracter horribly murdered

[1:20:22] <haveswordmuststing> @lewdskeletor13 the first thing Kiryu hits is a dude that looks like Harada LUL
[1:20:23] <%Radregice_> i feel like there would be more potential for guest characters if people were more okay with their characters getting mutilated in every match
[1:20:26] <+Tennochief> nice
[1:20:26] <%RedMageRebel> Y'all whos your're dream guest for MK
[1:20:26] <gorillahandz> I don't want to watch Kiryu get his face sliced off and brain eaten by Baraka thanks
[1:20:29] <%SaltyDongs> Majima instead
[1:20:31] <Dragon_Batman> Krushing blows
[1:20:32] <%BayowolfTerra> Hence why all the movie monsters
[1:20:32] <%Jetsfantasy> @arcaderabbit48 It may be dump, but it's also stupid. Also see Alice in Tekken and Ms. Fortune in Skullgirls so it isn't completely new
[1:20:33] <+Tennochief> OW
[1:20:34] <%thelonechris> F
[1:20:37] <%deviljhojho94> not dead btw :)
[1:20:39] <+Tennochief> OUCHIES
[1:20:39] <%Hilleltaco> God why does Twitch never stop desyncing
[1:20:39] <Ion_Laser> F
[1:20:41] <%spiritofmojave> Fucking hell
[1:20:41] <TikanZK> ow
[1:20:43] <%RedMageRebel> your* damn
[1:20:43] <%bars_l> well krud
[1:20:44] <%ElenaManetta> Goddamn that's a long fucking animation
[1:20:45] <%marsano168> He's fucking ded son
[1:20:45] <+Genericho> dont worry hes fine
[1:20:45] <+EmoLlama97> sounds like a goron LUL
[1:20:48] <alexandrecau> rubber kunai
[1:20:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> how the fuck is he not super dead by that
[1:20:49] <UnfilteredComic> KRITICAL
[1:20:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Scorpion never killed anyone :)
[1:20:51] <T_Sasquatch> @deafmutelaughing characters in this game fight actual gods , so who knows LUL
[1:20:51] <sjcodan> Those take way too long
[1:20:52] <%MisterCrimson> Krushing Blows. Normal hits that do boosted damage once certain criteria are met
[1:20:53] <%salty_syd913> fuck that looks like it hurts
[1:20:56] <ArtThouBored> Krushing Blows do good chunky damage and they are sometimes if it's counterhit
[1:20:56] <%deviljhojho94> i miss goron so fucking much bros tomatoPain
[1:20:59] <%deviljhojho94> i want to die
[1:20:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> HOW DO THEY KEEP COMlNG UP WITH THESE
[1:21:00] <Jigglebounce> Like his skull imploded come on lmao
[1:21:01] <volraths_bane> it's a crushing blow. There's special extra damage attacks that only trigger if you meet the right conditions and only once per match each
[1:21:03] <%rdark_ksu> they really went above and beyond for the gore factor. Got inventive
[1:21:04] <Dragon_Batman> Some have different ways to trigger that
[1:21:05] <+Tennochief> LUL
[1:21:06] <%thelonechris> Oh no
[1:21:08] <gorillahandz> Mortal Kombat guests suck because if it's someone cool like Bayonetta or Kiryu it means you have to watch them get horribly murdered, unlike assholes like Freddy or Kratos
[1:21:08] <arcaderabbit48> @Jetsfantasy I did immediately think of Fortune, yeah. But she's meant to be a more comical character, wheras Frost seemed mostly pretty serious.
[1:21:09] <%Jetsfantasy> LUL
[1:21:09] <T_Sasquatch> Ok now go online LUL
[1:21:09] <%laserbeaming> YOU KOQUERED

[1:21:51] <%valriot> DC who?
[1:21:52] <TruTrashMan> But the Injustice comics had some REALLY cool ideas!
[1:21:52] <T_Sasquatch> A fucking tutorial in a fighting game PogChamp
[1:21:53] <%MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat Each character tutorial gives you a skin for completing it
[1:21:54] <dekkitout> Fair-
[1:21:55] <Dr_Mooose> in what?
[1:21:55] <VRNK> mk tech demo
[1:21:55] <%LozsCat> This Tutorial is hella good
[1:21:56] <+xx123manxx> Big Facts
[1:21:57] <Dragon_Batman> Except not really but I see what your saying
[1:21:58] <Capn_Bilge> how DARE you be correct!?
[1:21:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Injustice is cool BibleThump
[1:21:58] <+Haruharuharuko> Wow rude
[1:21:59] <+wackylunchsack> you'd think woolie mode would be dlc
[1:22:00] <deafmutelaughing> special move *C*ancels?!
[1:22:00] <%ennui_on_me> Injustice is just Mortal Kombat with good characters
[1:22:01] <%Radregice_> cancels NotLikeThis
[1:22:04] <rubbishbinge> do et yuou coweurde
[1:22:05] <ArtThouBored> Injustice is the waiting period between MKs
[1:22:06] <DaniReDux> Fair enough
[1:22:06] <flubber3d> pat's prejudice is an injustice SeemsGood
[1:22:07] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Woah. Hot takes from pat.
[1:22:08] <haveswordmuststing> Character Tutorials is all i need to see to say its a good tutorial
[1:22:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> injustice was indepth about their tutorials, they showed you how many frames a move took
[1:22:10] <+Tennochief> DO THEM ALL
[1:22:11] <%ECRead> it's true, but he shouldn't say it
[1:22:13] <%deviljhojho94> crikGood
[1:22:15] <+aspirationdeath> Its story mode shits on mks tho
[1:22:15] <+Shinmaddrox> Incentive to train
[1:22:16] <%RedMageRebel> is injustice bad? I know I'm casual with fighters but I always liked it
[1:22:16] <%logoth_> That's a good fucking idea
[1:22:17] <Grayson_XLS> What about Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe?
[1:22:17] <+Answer_Moose> God this game is such a game for woolie
[1:22:17] <%ElenaManetta> Is MK trying to set a standard with tutorials or something? Are they trying to encourage more people to get into fighting games, I have no idea if the community is dwindling or not
[1:22:17] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Is it christmas?
[1:22:18] <%BayowolfTerra> and proper incentive!
[1:22:18] <deafmutelaughing> WHY IS IT WITH A C
[1:22:18] <dekkitout> Neat~
[1:22:18] <+RoboBro1212> "you spelled kombat with a C!"
[1:22:19] <suikudo> Super man a good character? LUL
[1:22:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> shit were not doing story this night arent we
[1:22:21] <%Hilleltaco> I was never a huge Mortal Kombat fan but the fact that there's a frame data tutorial is actually amazing, lack of explanation is one of my biggest problems with stuff like Tekken
[1:22:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> along with the frame data
[1:22:25] <xeros720> guess we're doing character tutorials all stream
[1:22:26] <%valriot> Thats super good, i like that
[1:22:28] <+tigerfang86> @ThatGuyfromMars Critical TOMORROW I GUESS boneAAH
[1:22:32] <$spardanwarrior> @AngriestPat You get a special bonus for beating all of the advance tutorials
[1:22:32] <suikudo> DC good characters? LUL
[1:22:34] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat "release check" is negative edge.
[1:22:34] <%deviljhojho94> Special move Kancel
[1:22:36] <schmuggies> flippy kick
[1:22:36] <dekkitout> Wait, don't you mean Kharacter?
[1:22:39] <%yoshkosh20> oh man. johnny looks like a jackass with that haircut.
[1:22:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tigerfang86 wait what
[1:22:43] <arcaderabbit48> I'll say this much, Injustice has a fun roster. Enchantress, Swamp Thing, and Scarecrow are all good picks
[1:22:43] <+Tennochief> aw
[1:22:44] <DracaenaLeaf> JAx's voice isn't as deep :(
[1:22:51] <sir_nack> Seems like one of the best tutorials in a non-niche fighter
[1:22:56] <asd2897> yeah even just messing around in the demo it felt better
[1:22:57] <%deviljhojho94> He is tomatoDevious
[1:22:58] <%Radregice_> it seems like there's less of the weird character animations like from X
[1:22:58] <antonius40k> l@yoshkosh20 implying that Johnny Cage at any point didn't look like a jackass
[1:22:59] <%valriot> Fighting games giving players ACTUAL fucking rewards has been needed for a long time
[1:23:00] <+Tennochief> the best jackass
[1:23:02] <+Walopoh> 100% intended
[1:23:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "with the haircut."
[1:23:03] <%Swish19XX> Let Pat learn so you'll all stop yelling at him
[1:23:03] <Madbearv> Johnny Cage for main character
[1:23:04] <thebalticguy1> Johnny's great in this game
[1:23:04] <MarylandJutsu> you would know PAt
[1:23:04] <starotter70> is Jax wearing yellow here?
[1:23:06] <Cobaltor_252> but now he's an oooold jackass
[1:23:07] <+Andrizzleton> johnny is a jackass
[1:23:09] <mayorrev> jackass is in Johnny's blood
[1:23:10] <%MisterCrimson> Johnny is a good father, don't call him a jackass
[1:23:13] <%deviljhojho94> Kano looks like an idiot
[1:23:13] <px120> That's his defining feature
[1:23:15] <+Shinmaddrox> So Johnny Cage looks like Johnny Cage?
[1:23:16] <%connos_livereview> Australia vs America
[1:23:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ELLO BABYBEEE
[1:23:18] <%Laecerelius> HE's studied all ya moves!
[1:23:18] <+xx123manxx> 99% of all the characters in this game have bad redesigns or shitty voice acting
[1:23:18] <%deviljhojho94> erron black always styling tho
[1:23:18] <%Kataguro> I studied all your moves SONYA
[1:23:19] <xeros720> it's no UNIST, but it's still really good
[1:23:24] <alexandrecau> study all his moves pat
[1:23:25] <%marsano168> out of everything I'm surprised Erron Black is back
[1:23:28] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s Australia man!
[1:23:29] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Johnny?! A jackass?! Couldn’t be?!
[1:23:29] <+Walopoh> Kombo
[1:23:31] <%salty_syd913> wait is this cowboy looking asshole new?
[1:23:32] <+RoboBro1212> yo who the fuck is Erron Black he looks cool
[1:23:32] <Run44forrest> background johnny
[1:23:33] <%deviljhojho94> Back to Black
[1:23:35] <+Tennochief> cowboy ninjas are awesome
[1:23:35] <haveswordmuststing> @starotter70 its Mortal Kombat, of course he does Kappa
[1:23:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I can't believe they found a way to make Kano sound MORE Aussie
[1:23:36] <Madbearv> oh man what's matt mercer doing in mortak kombat
[1:23:39] <UnderpaidBob> The only subpar VA I've seen is Sonya
[1:23:39] <+Tennochief> besides Mesa Prime
[1:23:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[1:23:40] <%rdark_ksu> theres a cowboy in this game?
[1:23:41] <sir_nack> Yeah unist is still the king of fighting game tutorials
[1:23:43] <+Promessa_EX> kano looks good
[1:23:43] <arcaderabbit48> Erron Black did not need to exist, but I'm glad he does
[1:23:43] <majindusto> Huge Jackass...But a Great Father
[1:23:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Do all the Krazy Kombos.
[1:23:47] <sjcodan> Oh god Black's idle pose is stull fucking awful
[1:23:47] <%Radregice_> i wish kenshi came back FeelsBadMan
[1:23:48] <$Brother_Coduss> Oh hey, it's brokeback mountain!
[1:23:48] <LVDoomien> @RoboBro1212 MKX new character that works for Kotal Khan
[1:23:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Gonna kill you like the fishies killed Steve Irwin, I will!
[1:23:49] <%RedMageRebel> Erron Black, he was in MKX
[1:23:50] <UnderpaidBob> everyone else is pretty great
[1:23:50] <%Jetsfantasy> Australia is basically America 2
[1:23:52] <alexandrecau> erron black is arthur morabout itgan when you think
[1:23:57] <+play_un_squadron> kano looks more whack than usual
[1:24:00] <%Dr_DangerPhD> you have to hit the jump in deep
[1:24:02] <dekkitout> Is there a pirate ninja in Mortal Kombat?
[1:24:02] <%Remery_> MKX needed a Deadshot
[1:24:03] <%RedMageRebel> Hes actually cool, I dig him
[1:24:04] <%deviljhojho94> I wish mileena was back FeelsBadMan
[1:24:06] <Dragon_Batman> You weren't comboing it looked like
[1:24:07] <haveswordmuststing> so does Erron Black still flail his arms around like a wimp in this game
[1:24:07] <%Mornaka> WTF is Johnny doing
[1:24:08] <+16BitAndUp> Commit to the attack
[1:24:12] <antonius40k> God I hate that cowboy. out of all the wackiness in mortal Kombat He's just never felt like he actually belong there with his devil May cry guns that don't kill things when he shoots
[1:24:14] <%Hilleltaco> The jumps still kinda look weird
[1:24:14] <horsesaredumb> tight timing?
[1:24:16] <Death_by_moogle> Finish me?
[1:24:16] <nelsonq415> Deep
[1:24:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kano honestly looks like Bennett from Commando
[1:24:18] <@lewdskeletor13> Erron Black aka Troy Baker
[1:24:21] <nelsonq415> Kreygasm
[1:24:24] <+purps26> dial in the full combo while he's in the air?
[1:24:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Hey croikie. Gonna punch the wallabies.
[1:24:26] <VRNK> òwó
[1:24:27] <$RubberFistFight> [IT'S GROWING]
[1:24:29] <+DrunkenDice> just go deeper 4Head
[1:24:30] <%valriot> Junp animations still whack though LUL
[1:24:31] <%marsano168> These Australians must be some sort of Crazed warrior race of outworld
[1:24:31] <VHLW> they probably make the example deep so people learn
[1:24:31] <%Mornaka> Look at Johnny Cage in the back, all creepy
[1:24:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I STUDlED ALL YO MOVES
[1:24:33] <sjcodan> DEEPER
[1:24:34] <+Tennochief> Kano should be more bulky like in MKX
[1:24:35] <+Answer_Moose> The tool tip is saying do the input before you land?
[1:24:36] <UnfilteredComic> Deeper pat
[1:24:37] <%Kataguro> The tutorial got Crazy Talked into being less good
[1:24:37] <%FrostMass22> @underpaidbob Isn't Sonya's VA crazy? Someone earlier said she's transphobic and a sandy hook conspiracy theorist? If that's true, it's surprising because everything else with the game
[1:24:37] <StarkAvKnark> Why hello from early morning EU
[1:24:37] <alwayspronking> LUL [ITS GROWING]
[1:24:37] <+16BitAndUp> You dont confirm jump ins in NRS games
[1:24:39] <Ravoric> Is the game trying to tell you the string isnt real?
[1:24:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> ELLO BAYBE
[1:24:43] <%Remery_> Cool the Australian
[1:24:43] <Gallhint> What all have I missed?
[1:24:47] <%laserbeaming> are there short hops?
[1:24:47] <+Andrizzleton> yep
[1:24:48] <%salty_syd913> wait is that jonny in the back lol
[1:24:50] <starotter70> Oh, look at me jump'n around all like me ol' Kangaroos
[1:24:50] <Jigglebounce> maybe you should look at the FRAME DATA
[1:24:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @RoboBro1212 He worked with Shang Tsung first. Shang Tsung went to cowboy times, gave Erron Black immortality at the cost of not be able to sleep.
[1:24:52] <nelsonq415> Thta swhat she said
[1:24:52] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@TikanZK) (warning)
[1:24:55] <majindusto> Mileena, Rain and Reptile need to come back
[1:24:57] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah you just hammer out the combo as fast as possible.
[1:24:58] <horsesaredumb> what???
[1:24:59] <%Jetsfantasy> Yup. That's a MK
[1:25:00] <i_worship_his_shadow> read the tip on the screen
[1:25:00] <SovPho> that's fuckin weird
[1:25:01] <$Brother_Coduss> @deviljhojho94 she died doing what Plague would have loved, making out with a sexy bug lady
[1:25:02] <leviathan666303> You buffer the attacks?
[1:25:03] <%wujak> thats what the tip in the top right has been saying over and over
[1:25:03] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat You basically pre-buffer your entire combo
[1:25:04] <$RubberFistFight> that caugght me off guard too.
[1:25:04] <+16BitAndUp> Commit early
[1:25:05] <+discodemolition> i felt like mkx was that way
[1:25:05] <Nina96> THATS WERID
[1:25:07] <%valriot> Thats fuckin good, cos SFV is worse for that shite
[1:25:07] <+Andrizzleton> you gotta diala combo
[1:25:08] <+DrunkenDice> mash like it's evo Pat Kappa
[1:25:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Johnny is watching these two villains fight LUL
[1:25:12] <%ElenaManetta> That seems like very difficult to utilize in a fight, but I'm a dumb idiot for fighting games so
[1:25:13] <xeros720> odd, since it seems to work either way, tutorial is just goofy
[1:25:14] <Dragon_Batman> ooooh inputs that have to be dialed in
[1:25:15] <DaniReDux> @Gallhint pat trying the tutorial
[1:25:16] <%spiritofmojave> Seriously what the fuck is Johnny doing
[1:25:16] <sjcodan> Oh its got that crustybuffer?
[1:25:17] <%laserbeaming> so you have to commit
[1:25:22] <GalacticSpecter> That's why it's called dial-a-kombo
[1:25:23] <sosuke5> Fighting games in a nutshell: just mash the buttons lol
[1:25:27] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Just mash the buttons real hard
[1:25:27] <%Radregice_> wasn't it like that before? haven't played MKX in a hot minute but i remember that
[1:25:27] <UnfilteredComic> Kano Ball PogChamp
[1:25:27] <+Answer_Moose> short hops?!
[1:25:27] <Hyphixsys> DSP is gonna have a field trip with this game Kappa
[1:25:29] <@lewdskeletor13> Johnny is just chilling
[1:25:29] <%RedMageRebel> Sonya's VA is Rohnda Rousey; I dont know if she said any of that but I doubt it, considering how famous/infamous she is in some circles
[1:25:31] <+rathekingofthesun> KOMPLETIONIST
[1:25:31] <+purps26> You can always mash out a combo super fast. you don't have to time them
[1:25:31] <%BayowolfTerra> it ain't a real MK11 without Meat Kappa
[1:25:32] <eldragon_1> Mkx was like that
[1:25:32] <arcaderabbit48> I feel like MK has ascended button mashing to an artform. The game expects you and ecnourages you to button mash, so long as you're doing it the right way
[1:25:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> KoF?
[1:25:32] <+xx123manxx> I find it incredible that Johhny went from a nobody to the best character in the series in just 2 games
[1:25:33] <kingbaconcrispy> Attack buffering? Didn't they have that in blazblue? shouldn't he be familiar with that?
[1:25:35] <sjcodan> Not at all
[1:25:36] <flubber3d> TEST YOUR MIGHT
[1:25:36] <+BoomerTiro> That looked like an arena you'd find Guile in from street fighter
[1:25:36] <+RoboBro1212> "krusty buffer" LUL
[1:25:43] <HeadsHeldHigh> krumpet buffers
[1:25:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Hyphixsys implying hes not gonna blame online all day

[1:25:45] <%RedMageRebel> I miss Cassies old VA; she sounds too young in this
[1:25:47] <%Kduff89> do button yeah
[1:25:47] <%ElenaManetta> HAHAHA
[1:25:48] <%Laecerelius> Pat? Play Blazblue?!
[1:25:49] <Hyphixsys> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli LUL

[1:25:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:25:57] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Krusty burger
[1:25:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Man why can't we have Jeri Ryan back as sonya
[1:26:01] <antonius40k> is it just me or did they slim jax up big time
[1:26:01] <sjcodan> I can't believe I got him to say "Krusty buffer"
[1:26:02] <+Haruharuharuko> Watch out girl imma give you the ole crusty buffer
[1:26:04] <kingbaconcrispy> Ok yeah no he probably didn'T
[1:26:06] <ArtThouBored> This track is giving me the MK5 vibes
[1:26:11] <ArtThouBored> Or Dead Pool
[1:26:12] <%Mornaka> that's a good looking Jax
[1:26:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Hyphixsys Its online lag, doooood, im not bad, the game always had laggy shit online
[1:26:17] <Ion_Laser> @ThatGuyfromMars i know right
[1:26:18] <Dao_Puppy> Wait did MK have KOF hops before?
[1:26:19] <%rdark_ksu> yes my boi jax!
[1:26:19] <haveswordmuststing> short hops in MK... where have i been this whole time
[1:26:19] <+play_un_squadron> theyve all slimmed down
[1:26:20] <+DrunkenDice> maybe it's just me but Krusty Buff sounds like a smash term LUL
[1:26:20] <RICE02> Its KOF short hop
[1:26:20] <ShichiNoBushi> What's the hops, bro?
[1:26:21] <Nina96> @AngriestPat so is sf5 dead now?

[1:26:23] <meermadon> rouseys VA is fucking awful in this
[1:26:23] <%ElenaManetta> fuck pat reads so fucking fast
[1:26:24] <kingbaconcrispy> I didn't know they now called it krusty buffer or whatever
[1:26:25] <Chumblago13> @thatguyfrommars Ronda does surprisingly well
[1:26:27] <daisymaisy02> @ThatGuyfromMars no instead we apparently need the transphobe who can't act and thinks Sandy Hook didn't happen
[1:26:29] <%ElenaManetta> i'm like halfway through by the time he hits next
[1:26:30] <Dragon_Batman> Kinda like the 3rd strike instant overhead but with more inputs
[1:26:31] <%Niney_Who> Tiime to WAVEDASH
[1:26:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Yo jax looks fucking badass
[1:26:33] <+purps26> being able to read a low kick to do that in a match seems tough
[1:26:36] <$Brother_Coduss> didnt jax get killed by erron black last game>
[1:26:36] <$RubberFistFight> there are a LOOOOOTT of MK3/UMK3 designs showing up in story mode, and I LIKE IT

[1:27:28] <%FrostMass22> @purps26 There's tons of stuff
[1:27:29] <Chumblago13> Heard her, as far as voice acting for this game she does well
[1:27:29] <sjcodan> Why are nearly all the men half naked, but none of the women have any skin showing? I understand tonning down the sexuality, but it seems lopsided
[1:27:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man all the redesigns looks fucking awesome
[1:27:37] <+combomaniadeluxe> why isn't it dash kancle
[1:27:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Answer_Moose Time travel
[1:27:42] <haveswordmuststing> are these specific dash attacks you can you cancel into the standing normal off dash
[1:27:44] <%deviljhojho94> @Answer_Moose All your favorite characters are dead but the ones that are alive look pretty nice
[1:27:46] <Nina96> i dont like her hair though
[1:27:46] <+Tennochief> redesigns are meh
[1:27:47] <+tigerfang86> yeah these designs are all rad
[1:27:47] <+xx123manxx> @sjcodan Devs are fake woke
[1:27:47] <+Promessa_EX> kano is really the only man showing skin so far
[1:27:48] <%Prevot> oh right it's fucking ronda rousey
[1:27:49] <$RubberFistFight> @sjcodan the designs vary across the board, calm the fuck down.
[1:27:50] <%valriot> SFV is only hype at EVO or CC, then you put in back in the garbage
[1:27:52] <%Grey_Serval> Why is Princess Leia here?

[1:28:00] <%Niney_Who> Dash Cankel
[1:28:04] <antonius40k> she looks like the dark empress which is what she's supposed to look like. not a random girl who's basically in a slave bikini. which is fine just not for her. an alternate costume yeah but this is who she is now and you should all love it

[1:28:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He ghot tired of everyones shit
[1:28:19] <kingbaconcrispy> Yeah Rounda is clearly not a voice actor, it's bad in any scene where there's Cassie or Raiden. They're so much better then her.
[1:28:19] <%marsano168> Edgelord Raiden in the house
[1:28:20] <smegma_sorcerer> raiden looks like the power ranger robot LUL
[1:28:20] <%ElenaManetta> So here's my thing with fighting games: I do the tutorial and everything SEEMS O-K when you do stuff one at a time. But then when thrown into a match, I panic and button mash.
[1:28:21] <%GarbageNirvana> So we can't even get towers right now, this might be the best use of our time at the moment
[1:28:22] <daisymaisy02> It is kinda funny that the women all still have lil kitten heels on their shoes

[1:29:27] <+tigerfang86> and he fucked that up too
[1:29:32] <antonius40k> he is a loser that transcends time and space that is the extent to how much of a loser he is

[1:29:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> they did a weird realign of the characters right? Kabal and Scorpion are good guys or anti-heroes now, and ermac is a bad guy again
[1:29:58] <T_Sasquatch> raiden basically gets tired of everyones shit and decides to be a massive asshole for "good" reasons
[1:30:00] <+purps26> this game seems really good
[1:30:01] <xeros720> can you dial it in during the animation?
[1:30:01] <%fFailureatlife> @Remery_ dont listen to him it was said completely unironically

[1:30:01] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat You skim-skipped. EACH blow is once per match.
[1:30:02] <%marsano168> Kabal looks like a tuskan raider lol
[1:30:05] <antonius40k> I definitely dig this kabal outfit
[1:30:07] <%RedMageRebel> I miss good guy Ermac tho, he was a fave as a kid
[1:30:07] <xiccy> Raiden sucks
[1:30:13] <alexandrecau> wait only one krushing per fight too ?
[1:30:13] <%BayowolfTerra> does the community have a better name for these then "krushing blow"?
[1:30:14] <%FrostMass22> @rubberfistfight He's strawmanning the other side of the argument by cherry picking the one idiot.
[1:30:15] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yeah ermac was cool
[1:30:16] <$MonsterEnvy> Ermac is not in this game
[1:30:18] <%deviljhojho94> Raiden will never be cool
[1:30:23] <%deviljhojho94> fuck his hat
[1:30:23] <%RedMageRebel> I know, I was just saying
[1:30:26] <+Promessa_EX> uh no rebreaking bones
[1:30:29] <T_Sasquatch> @MonsterEnvy he is :)
[1:30:29] <%Remery_> @fFailureatlife It's a joke to everyone and someone was serious about it
[1:30:32] <@lewdskeletor13> @frostmass22 Hey. Maybe stop. Thanks
[1:30:32] <dekkitout> I like his hat
[1:30:33] <lloyddboy> MK11 is ANTI-SCALIE
[1:30:35] <+Tennochief> ooo
[1:30:36] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Oof ow my bones
[1:30:36] <%marsano168> Was ermac killed last game I forget?
[1:30:37] <Dragon_Batman> Yea whole match
[1:30:38] <%Prevot> monkaS
[1:30:38] <UnderpaidBob> it would be so weird to have reptile as DLC
[1:30:39] <sdgundum990> @Haarute again, it isn't about the designs themselves, it's about the devs insulting people who disagree. I agree the designs are good, I just don't think it's a good idea to insult the people who want to buy your game.
[1:30:41] <Rhinoprotoss> KRUSH, KILL KESTROY
[1:30:43] <+tigerfang86> @ThatGuyfromMars tbh scorpion's an ok guy if he has a chance to calm down from his FAMLY Famly famly
[1:30:44] <$RubberFistFight> @FrostMass22 I dunno, there seem to be a lot of similar-thinking idiots right here in this chat, he's not singling out just the one.
[1:30:48] <+Answer_Moose> So could you essentially chain the crushing blows?
[1:30:49] <%Captainahab_37> how much milk do you need to have MK bones
[1:30:51] <%RedMageRebel> Him being a weird mummy in X was a weird feel for me
[1:30:51] <+RoboBro1212> I really like this trend of "bullshit buttons" being once PER MATCH
[1:30:55] <sunny_side_up> yep @Answer_Moose
[1:30:56] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Here come lame “Krushing Blow Job” jokes
[1:30:56] <+kraajkase> so they're basically consumables...
[1:30:56] <%FrostMass22> @lewdskeletor13 What am I doing wrong?
[1:30:57] <+RoboBro1212> good choice from NR imo
[1:30:58] <%JaydenSai> !uptime
[1:30:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 31m.
[1:30:59] <%ElenaManetta> Wait, I'm confused by that. Is it treating Krushing Blow like a consumable or a meter
[1:30:59] <%Intersceptre> Max found some silly 60% kombo off a Noob KrushBlow
[1:31:02] <alexandrecau> But they don't want to buy the game
[1:31:03] <%RedMageRebel> I just want my cool ninja bro with TK powers
[1:31:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tigerfang86 I'd be pissed too if my family was brutally murdered
[1:31:06] <Hyphixsys> ERROR LUL
[1:31:07] <%Mornaka> HE MEW
[1:31:07] <Nina96> u can still counter after right its just no animation?
[1:31:08] <+Tennochief> I'm still confused on how bullets are even a problem anymore
[1:31:09] <%thelonechris> Oh no
[1:31:09] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat is this game stirring the GAWBLINS yet?
[1:31:09] <MangoCoal01> @marsano168 Nah, Ermac was still alive after MKX.
[1:31:09] <ScreamingMeat> Wish there were more games that had some of China's weirder weapons like the Hook Swords, Meteor Hammer, 3-Sectioned Staff, Monk Spade, ect.
[1:31:12] <Bakefowl> @sdgundum990 How did they insult you
[1:31:13] <dekkitout> He kries D:

[1:31:24] <+tigerfang86> oh he's right to be mad, he's just not a good guy when he's mad :V

[1:31:44] <haveswordmuststing> @lewdskeletor13 but it's more interesting than the actual game LUL
[1:31:45] <Mnightshyamallama> aren't the krush moves just the moves from SC6?
[1:31:45] <+QuadraticGravity> I dont think hes listening skeletor
[1:31:46] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@MrSuperCasualBoom) (warning)
[1:31:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Every character an alternate swimsuit Kostume
[1:31:50] <%ElenaManetta> Look at those WORDS ON THE SCREEN. THat's fucking cool man
[1:31:50] <%deviljhojho94> fuck you moobot
[1:31:50] <antonius40k> @lewdskeletor13 fortunately or unfortunately it's a little too late for that.
[1:31:51] <CrackerJack450> @angriestpat any way we can get you to do one character tutorial?
[1:31:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> > dedicated block buttons LUL
[1:31:53] <HeadsHeldHigh> Jade is Kreygasm Kreygasm in this game
[1:31:54] <arcaderabbit48> Mortal Corn Bat
[1:31:54] <%deviljhojho94> YEYEYEYEYEY
[1:31:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tigerfang86 yeah but didn't he become a good-ish guy after he realized he fucked up after killing sub zero in 9?
[1:31:57] <%deviljhojho94> monkaS
[1:31:58] <+Tennochief> ok now Jade looks better
[1:31:58] <%ElenaManetta> I don't know if I've seen that in a tutorial before.
[1:32:02] <sjcodan> KRUSTY GUARDiNG
[1:32:05] <%valriot> Hairy Guarding
[1:32:05] <suikudo> Wow it really is teaching the fuzzy guard
[1:32:08] <$RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 honestly I think you're gonna half to start getting a bit timeout-happy, because Pat called an end to the argument what, like 20 minutes ago, and it seems people just can't help themselves.
[1:32:08] <+KSabot> fuzzy guard is a bit more than that but
[1:32:08] <pipboy344> @crackerjack450 FUCK yooooooou
[1:32:09] <Desertfishing> this makes me wanna get the game but i'll only play it once and never touch it again
[1:32:09] <%Prevot> I still can't believe Jade's back
[1:32:10] <+KSabot> I guess
[1:32:13] <+Answer_Moose> Fuzzy Guarding?
[1:32:13] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oh shit yeah smoke was a good guy for like 5 minutes too
[1:32:15] <%Kataguro> They'd probably teach you a name with a K or something
[1:32:15] <%Intersceptre> I'd argue this isn't quick enough to be fuzzy guard but ok
[1:32:17] <%marsano168> dude Jade loks so dang cool now
[1:32:18] <%deviljhojho94> I will avenge my fallen bethren. You will see Moobot. One day. Our night will come tomatoPain
[1:32:23] <%yoshkosh20> @Youwereeatenbyalid I demand kano in a banana hammock
[1:32:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> YO does cyborg smoke still exist
[1:32:25] <+RoboBro1212> this game probably has the most newbie-friendly tutorial I've ever seen
[1:32:25] <majindusto> The Fuck is Fuzzyguarding?
[1:32:26] <sdgundum990> @Bakefowl They didn't insult me, they insulted the people who wanted the sexier costumes. I'm against devs insulting thir audience.
[1:32:26] <+KSabot> fuzze guarding is different from purely reacting
[1:32:28] <%valriot> Use your fuckin MUFF GUARD
[1:32:29] <LiquidMathew> I can't believe one of the characters just sounds like Dr. Claw now
[1:32:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @RubberFistFight not helping dude, drop it as well
[1:32:29] <EMP_Ike_Turner> DIRTY
[1:32:30] <+Tennochief> ouch
[1:32:31] <@lewdskeletor13> Moobot cannot be stopped
[1:32:32] <+Promessa_EX> i don't like it when crouch guarding is your default
[1:32:32] <%valkuma> Tennochief her model looks better but the covered up midriff to oppose twitter crowds ResidentSleeper
[1:32:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Pat youre so free LUL
[1:32:33] <DaniReDux> @AngriestPat get ready to buy that anti-gravity water drop machine for elmo
[1:32:35] <%FrostMass22> @rubberfistfight Yeah, ban me because I disagree with you.
[1:32:36] <%ElenaManetta> Damn, I would say to make the tutorial even better, the block words should be color coded to help train your brain even better
[1:32:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:32:37] <UnfilteredComic> Low to 3 overheads? Jesus
[1:32:39] <MangoCoal01> I really like Jade's revenant design.
[1:32:42] <%RedMageRebel> nah smoke never got cyberized in this timeline
[1:32:46] <starotter70> Man, Jade's new design is great
[1:32:46] <+tigerfang86> lol
[1:32:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @yoshkosh20 Johnny cage in a pink g-string
[1:32:52] <+purps26> that's a fucked up mixup
[1:32:53] <$RubberFistFight> @Sphincter_Spelunker I was talking to lewdskeletor, not you. :)
[1:32:54] <%Aztec50> Blockstrings: The Game
[1:32:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oh yeah it was subzero this time wasn't it
[1:32:57] <+tigerfang86> what a mixup
[1:32:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> and sunglasses
[1:33:00] <arcaderabbit48> Is everyone in this game undead and/or evil now??
[1:33:00] <%Jetsfantasy> That's a pretty dirty special she has
[1:33:01] <%BayowolfTerra> Smokes a big ol evil zombie dude
[1:33:01] <%MisterCrimson> Game: Learn the match-ups idiot
[1:33:01] <+Tennochief> @valkuma I like midriffs but it wouldn't work for her costume here
[1:33:03] <LiquidMathew> i'm still a little disappointed Cyber Sub-Zero never went anywhere
[1:33:03] <icantstopthescreams> !uptime
[1:33:03] <olwe123> This game looks sick, Can't wait too get it
[1:33:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 33m.
[1:33:05] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Krusty Krab is that one dick spectator throwing seafood at a Melee tournament.
[1:33:05] <+rareqq> what mixup?
[1:33:05] <sjcodan> I can't wait to deal with low-OH-OH strings online
[1:33:06] <%ORGANizerC> yeah that mixup is crazy if you've never seen it
[1:33:07] <Nina96> Porb gonna play jade
[1:33:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatPorgmo
[1:33:08] <haveswordmuststing> @Youwereeatenbyalid he could look good in a Urien thong Kappa
[1:33:09] <televisedrevolting> @youwereeatenbyalid I would pay a wild amount of money for that.
[1:33:10] <%deviljhojho94> Wait who is a good guy and a bad guy this time aronud?
[1:33:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man I can't remember all the lore in MK
[1:33:12] <dekkitout> There's something about Noob Saibot sounding like Dr. Claw that makes me chuffed, I mean cmon, look at the guy
[1:33:12] <@lewdskeletor13> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[1:33:14] <%yoshkosh20> Hell Yeah
[1:33:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @RubberFistFight k man
[1:33:16] <%RedMageRebel> Mmhm, they switched him back in the comics tho
[1:33:16] <Dementedpenguin> Jade looks like a cool-ass looking power ranger.
[1:33:22] <+Promessa_EX> yeah but a midriff would work on this costume
[1:33:23] <+Answer_Moose> I know in the past games, I remember smoke had a great finisher where he blew up the planet.
[1:33:27] <$Brother_Coduss> DANTE FOR MK11
[1:33:28] <%RedMageRebel> I know way too much about MK despite me playing only a handful of the games
[1:33:29] <+tigerfang86> give em the TIME STOP
[1:33:33] <%laserbeaming> have fun memorizing block strings I guess
[1:33:34] <%BayowolfTerra> there's a lot of good and bad guys.
[1:33:34] <%ORGANizerC> @deviljhojho94 everyone
[1:33:36] <%deviljhojho94> MK Lore is fucking stupid anyways, doenst mean I dont wanna understand what Im seeing
[1:33:38] <%Remery_> Almost thought it was Reptile
[1:33:38] <%ORGANizerC> is the bad guy
[1:33:42] <$RubberFistFight> @Answer_Moose lol yeah that was robosmoke in MK3, loved that fatality, it's so fucking absurd.
[1:33:42] <EMP_Ike_Turner> za warudo
[1:33:46] <%deviljhojho94> @ORGANizerC Hmmm I suposse that makes sense...
[1:33:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I love the MK lore, it's so nuts and stupid
[1:33:51] <Capn_Bilge> gotta getup to get down
[1:33:52] <%ElenaManetta> I can't handle the word "kompleted"
[1:33:52] <+krispen_wa> Let's learn how to Marc Echo's Getting Up
[1:33:52] <+tigerfang86> ^
[1:33:52] <+Tennochief> Raiden should've kept his alt costume in MK9
[1:33:53] <%RedMageRebel> we had the VHS's of the films when I was a kid and me and my bros watched them so much my mom hid them cause she was worried we'd hurt each other
[1:33:55] <DeanX27> Look at that "talk to the hand" stance while blocking
[1:33:55] <%yoshkosh20> my big thing is I hate it when people were stilletos and stuff in combat games like this.
[1:33:56] <%Intersceptre> They made this MK lenient. it's noob friendly-adjacent
[1:33:56] <deafmutelaughing> Wakeup, Getup, Getoutthere
[1:33:57] <%Prevot> MK is the stupidest
[1:34:00] <aceofspades627> pat needs help egtting up
[1:34:01] <+Answer_Moose> Smoke had always been one of my favorites.
[1:34:01] <+tigerfang86> Remember when BARAKA TOTALLY DIED
[1:34:01] <%Remery_> KUM
[1:34:02] <%Swish19XX> Servers are keepinmg me down
[1:34:04] <+tigerfang86> but they didn't
[1:34:05] <@lewdskeletor13> This games story mode is great
[1:34:05] <%valriot> Wake Up Get Up, Retort it
[1:34:06] <ScreamingMeat> I have no idea why, but Jade kinda reminds me of Raziel from Legacy of Kain
[1:34:07] <Nina96> MK lore makes me laugh
[1:34:08] <starotter70> Kongratualations
[1:34:09] <%BayowolfTerra> I think raidens still a good guy? just a prick now
[1:34:10] <arcaderabbit48> I love the Smoke Fatality where he pulls out a hokey stick and spikes your severed head with it
[1:34:11] <benjiFG> flashback to paige's beyond two souls stream
[1:34:13] <%thelonechris> Is that fucking Goro's corpse?
[1:34:13] <alexandrecau> Remember when Jade posed for playboy
[1:34:13] <+tigerfang86> because you didn't HAVE to perform that fatality as dvorah
[1:34:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I should revise my statement, I love MK lore post 9, it's so stupid and I love it
[1:34:15] <%RedMageRebel> I think my first actual MK was deception?? I only really liked the games with the new ones starting at 9
[1:34:17] <$RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 I'm partway into it now and yes, yes it is.
[1:34:24] <%Typhaeon> No okis here, only getus
[1:34:26] <%marsano168> I love MK cause of the whole "White guys heavy metal love letter to asian fantasy" feel
[1:34:27] <+tigerfang86> GORO CORPSE
[1:34:28] <%Kisabuza> GOOD
[1:34:28] <%FrostMass22> @swish19xx Are you able to do anything or is it true that a lot of stuff is online only?
[1:34:28] <+Tennochief> also hiis base costume in Injustice 2 rocks
[1:34:29] <alexandrecau> and then made an ad to compete in girls gone wild?
[1:34:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @valriot wow how could you be so ableist mods ban this person
[1:34:30] <%Jetsfantasy> Yes, but it costs meter now
[1:34:30] <arcaderabbit48> @thelonechris It looks like it
[1:34:31] <haveswordmuststing> man, anyone else think there's an alternate universe where they made MK into a cheesy Kung Fu movie tribute
[1:34:31] <%ThatGuyfromMars> MK games got better after 9 anyway
[1:34:32] <mayorrev> eesh looks like chat room had it's own Mortal Kombat
[1:34:33] <LiquidMathew> Raiden's just Angry Protector of Earth rather that Protector of Earth
[1:34:33] <$Brother_Coduss> @tigerfang86 honestly, theres so many takartans they just pick a new one every week or so and name him baraka
[1:34:36] <%deviljhojho94> My first MK was the one that had the stupid corpse guy with the flies
[1:34:36] <%MisterCrimson> wake-ups cost meter, so don't play like a bitch
[1:34:36] <asd2897> always wake up shoryu
[1:34:36] <combomaniadeluxe> so is MK's combo system like injustice's or is it different
[1:34:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd

[1:36:50] <%deviljhojho94> is sheeva on this game?
[1:36:52] <%Jetsfantasy> It's always weird seeing the physics also reset .
[1:36:52] <%ORGANizerC> i can't believe the 4 armed giant woman looks ugly
[1:36:53] <KingOfTheGeats> I don't like Sheeva's face

[1:37:08] <haveswordmuststing> wait... does that happen...
[1:37:12] <+Promessa_EX> i
[1:37:12] <%RedMageRebel> she was bad in 9 too
[1:37:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> that 90s hair
[1:37:13] <arcaderabbit48> Sheeva's face has never looked good. Its kinda the point, she's a demon person kinda
[1:37:15] <lloyddboy> KONTINUE
[1:37:15] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Sheeva has a big brain because she watches rick and morty
[1:37:17] <ScreamingMeat> Sheeva looks like a dude now. I miss my buff, 4-armed girl
[1:37:18] <UnfilteredComic> kontinue
[1:37:20] <%Jetsfantasy> ADVANCING GUARD
[1:37:20] <+Tennochief> her MK9 look is infinitely better than what she is here
[1:37:21] <xeros720> wonder how many frames you have
[1:37:21] <%RedMageRebel> shes always been weird looking
[1:37:22] <smegma_sorcerer> kontinue LuL
[1:37:22] <+QuadraticGravity> 'kontinue'
[1:37:23] <fairore> @brother_coduss steve
[1:37:23] <%ElenaManetta> Is Pat a pro yet? Is he ready to join an online game?
[1:37:24] <TruTrashMan> "kontinue" we cot one at least
[1:37:29] <+Promessa_EX> i'm curious now, because she's supposed to be an ugly monster
[1:37:30] <+blueface_yea_ight> @ancienttoco casHahaa
[1:37:30] <%deviljhojho94> Dvorah looks a bit fucked on MK11 but I cant put my finger on why....
[1:37:31] <ArtThouBored> Sheeva's face has issues but like...it's Sheeva. She's been an uggo since MK3
[1:37:34] <+RoboBro1212> Sheeva always looked like an action figure, probably because she literally was one lol
[1:37:38] <%spiritofmojave> Kontinue- these K's are getting out of hand LUL
[1:37:38] <ArtThouBored> And oh god her voice in MK3
[1:37:40] <%iwishthiswasicq> I like that Pat's own mouth can't even read it before his brain has moved on.
[1:37:44] <%ennui_on_me> Sheeva isn't even a playable character in this game, who cares
[1:37:45] <+Tennochief> Sheeva was hot in MK9
[1:37:45] <Frostydough> I T S G RO W I N G
[1:37:46] <starotter70> Not with that attitude
[1:37:46] <%deviljhojho94> NO, MORE Ks
[1:37:48] <ArtThouBored> AAAHH OOOHHH OH
[1:37:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oh man I'm not thinking of Sheeva, I'm thinking of Sindel or whatever
[1:37:52] <Dragon_Batman> Not with that attitude
[1:37:52] <Dr_Mooose> not with that attitude
[1:37:54] <@lewdskeletor13> Does Sheeva need to be pretty?
[1:37:55] <ArtThouBored> Burned into my mind
[1:37:58] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Fblock
[1:37:59] <%RedMageRebel> shes on the DLC list I think
[1:37:59] <+AncientToco> @blueface_yea_ight chasefD1 chasefD1
[1:37:59] <$Brother_Coduss> yes, because the HALF DRAGON DEMON is expected to be a fucking BEAUTY QUEEN
[1:38:00] <icantstopthescreams> Does the game feel better then MKX?
[1:38:00] <fairore> @tennochief cmonBruh
[1:38:01] <UnfilteredComic> I feel bad for the poor programmer who had to write some shit to turn all of the "c"s into k's
[1:38:02] <+plzdodge> I feel like Cyrax not being in the game is god laughing at me for laughing at people who wanted Rain to be in X
[1:38:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Kitana's mom or whatever, wow that's bad
[1:38:02] <%deviljhojho94> no but it helps
[1:38:03] <dekkitout> I demand more k's
[1:38:03] <+krispen_wa> Royal Release
[1:38:08] <%ashrv2> would love to see a 3rd strike stream sometime <3
[1:38:09] <%deviljhojho94> MORE K
[1:38:09] <majindusto> Not with that Attitude, you won't
[1:38:09] <xeros720> some tight timing there
[1:38:10] <%Jetsfantasy> First we had Woolie fight Daigo. Now we need Pat vs SonicFox Kappa
[1:38:12] <+Tennochief> @fairore I speak the truth
[1:38:12] <LiquidMathew> Sheeva's problem is her face is too human looking for her race
[1:38:13] <ArtThouBored> @lewdskeletor13 She does need a couple things but not due to prettiness
[1:38:19] <Prism_Wing> When they gonna bring back my boi Darrius?! Kappa
[1:38:19] <starotter70> Kost so many gauges
[1:38:20] <ArtThouBored> I miss her black lipstick
[1:38:20] <+blueface_yea_ight> casBueno
[1:38:22] <ScreamingMeat> Oh no the Gobolins are coming
[1:38:25] <%ElenaManetta> WOW
[1:38:25] <%deviljhojho94> i wish sheeva was more monstruous, true, like my boy goro
[1:38:25] <%RedMageRebel> THAT STILL MAKES ME MAD. why make fighters with a moveset in the single player but not playable
[1:38:25] <%Remery_> Just give Sheeva a mask and call it a day
[1:38:28] <%valriot> CLANG
[1:38:30] <ArtThouBored> Looks off without it
[1:38:30] <$Brother_Coduss> @LiquidMathew so....not ugly enough then?
[1:38:30] <%Intersceptre> Pat vs Sonicfox. Loser shits their fursuit match.
[1:38:32] <%manwithboxonhead> What did I miss?
[1:38:33] <%TheMilhouseExperience> If you replace sheevas brain with helium she could fly.
[1:38:38] <arcaderabbit48> Okay, but is Onaga here? Where is Onaga, the dragon king?
[1:38:39] <%ElenaManetta> DID HE DO IT? That was so fast I think I blinked
[1:38:42] <%deviljhojho94> I liked mileena more when she wasnt so pretty
[1:38:43] <starotter70> @manwithboxonhead Tutorial

[1:39:03] <TruTrashMan> That tip is mocking you I think
[1:39:03] <%RedMageRebel> Probably never coming cause he was never as cool as Shao Kahn or Shinnok
[1:39:04] <$Brother_Coduss> @deviljhojho94 agreed. lovely smile she used to have
[1:39:06] <%deviljhojho94> Time to fight max

[1:39:43] <+Salvation122> Things that will not be needed to complete story mode include
[1:39:48] <%Dr_DangerPhD> that down 2 has a hell of a disjointed hitbox lol
[1:39:49] <arcaderabbit48> @NumberTooBig ...okay??

[1:39:56] <%Remery_> You beat the Story Mode :0
[1:39:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Great! Excellent! Fantastic!
[1:39:59] <dekkitout> Just by watching this, my hands are beginning to feel why a stick would be better
[1:40:01] <%deviljhojho94> i can see it working!
[1:40:04] <SeventeenOnGod> servers are semi working now
[1:40:05] <+Mr_Lawful> remember when we used to think it was weird for games to always online?
[1:40:05] <+Answer_Moose> Now throw the old lady!
[1:40:06] <%ElenaManetta> Who the hell else is playing MK at midnight on a Monday
[1:40:08] <$Brother_Coduss> @deviljhojho94 i honestly think they gave her human lips just for the dvorah kiss of death scene. wouldnt have worked with baraka teeth
[1:40:08] <%RedMageRebel> Im so fucking glad I get my OG Kung Lao in this
[1:40:09] <%ElenaManetta> Get fucked video game world
[1:40:17] <majindusto> Pat, Remember the basics of CQC
[1:40:18] <Dementedpenguin> Because of course there's an arena stage LUL
[1:40:18] <%Konquerer> now for projektiles
[1:40:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I'm actually kinda shocked the servers are overloaded today, I didn't think MK was as popular as it used to be
[1:40:30] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Neat
[1:40:33] <@lewdskeletor13> MK is more popular now
[1:40:34] <%Intersceptre> Huhhh. Thats new.
[1:40:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> MK has always been popular at launch
[1:40:40] <%ennui_on_me> Mortal Kombat is the fighting game series that the like bro crowd likes
[1:40:42] <@lewdskeletor13> X was their best selling game
[1:40:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Never lasted a year though
[1:40:44] <%deviljhojho94> @Brother_Coduss Hmm all this time I tought they were just appealing to the common denominator but your explanation does make sense.... I think
[1:40:46] <%Prevot> MK is fucking huge
[1:40:49] <+Answer_Moose> Ooof
[1:40:50] <Dragon_Batman> That's a neat way to add mixups to those
[1:40:50] <%marsano168> Mk has been on an uphill climb since 9 and I'm glad for it
[1:40:52] <dekkitout> Kool~
[1:40:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Why is the guy from The Force Awakens in this game?
[1:40:53] <benjiFG> boop
[1:40:54] <%nitronLVIII> mk is like the most mainstream fighting game franchise
[1:40:54] <%Dr_DangerPhD> MK is like the most popular fighting game
[1:40:55] <%Remery_> MK is really popular all you need is some good trailers and tasty gore
[1:40:56] <%RedMageRebel> @ThatGuyfromMars maybe its my friend group but its always been one of the biggest launches in my area
[1:40:57] <arcaderabbit48> @ThatGuyfromMars My understanding is that the series got a resurgence when 9 did the reboot thing, and both it and 10 did really well. I think
[1:40:57] <TheGershon> MK has never been bigger
[1:40:57] <%deviljhojho94> Fighting games are becoming more popular!
[1:41:02] <%Intersceptre> Cow advantage tech
[1:41:03] <haveswordmuststing> MK is popular for a month and most people ditch the game
[1:41:04] <LiquidMathew> wonder who they'll add for DLC characters
[1:41:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> really? I never hear anything about MK after it's launch, I knew the quality of the games went up after 9
[1:41:08] <+Answer_Moose> God damn that looks painful
[1:41:09] <ScreamingMeat> @deviljhojho94 It was kinda weird how they kept her fucked up Tarkatan mouth but also put normal human lips over it with no cheeks
[1:41:10] <+purps26> this game has so many fucking mechanics
[1:41:10] <%RedMageRebel> we have big parties when it releases over the weekend to get drunk and play
[1:41:11] <benjiFG> now do frame data

[1:41:37] <+Answer_Moose> Koopy Sandwhich

[1:55:56] <Caidezes> LUL
[1:55:57] <fazoburquina> powered up by evil magic and immortal evil bruce lee @AngriestPat
[1:55:57] <dekkitout> LUL
[1:55:57] <%AncelDeLambert> y'know, at least in DOOM they had resources to gather

[1:56:05] <+thehoboacrossts> Liu Kang was a zombie at one point....
[1:56:06] <%JaydenSai> Death truly means nothing in the MK universe
[1:56:07] <BlindGato> Oh man Zombie Liu Kang was the best/worst
[1:56:07] <ArtThouBored> Jax beat him in X
[1:56:07] <%patriotrenegade> Except Cassie is now canonically the strongest because she defeated Shinnok @AngriestPat
[1:56:08] <Evilmuffistudios> being dead has only made ppl even cooler in mortal kombat

[2:48:09] <Bobbledygook> he does the BIG murder
[2:48:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> well..
[2:48:10] <MasterTonberry23> No he totally murdered the shit out of Liu Kang
[2:48:10] <gorillahandz> he kinda did maybe a lil bit
[2:48:10] <%Konquerer> he explicitly did
[2:48:11] <antonius40k> he did
[2:48:11] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Even though it was Sindel that killed the entire MK9 kast
[2:48:11] <%AncelDeLambert> ... eeeeeeh
[2:48:12] <+iamreadytopoop> enter the dragon!
[2:48:13] <Dragon_Batman> The only person who knows is the evil Raiden
[2:48:13] <+preppyposs> SHES RIGHT
[2:48:14] <Solokaldaka> breaMadface Raiden is ebil
[2:48:14] <majindusto> Accidentally
[2:48:14] <Exicuren> Well, Liu Kang lashed out at Raiden first, tho
[2:48:16] <+Grayhammatter> but he actually did though
[2:48:17] <ireliaismaiwaifu> its not
[2:48:17] <%patriotrenegade> That's negligent homicide
[2:48:17] <Dovakhin573> TBF That was a freak accident
[2:48:18] <Run44forrest> dude theyre from the future
[2:48:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SHES SO RIGHT
[2:48:18] <%Birdigalore> I mean Raiden was right in the end, but then Liu Kang decided not to give a fuck anymore
[2:48:21] <LiquidMathew> I mean he DID get murdered, just not by Raiden
[2:48:21] <ArtThouBored> And maybe it's not smart to punch a Thunder God
[2:48:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Liu Kang died because he lashed out tho
[2:48:22] <+spiegelspike> manslaughter
[2:48:23] <Echelon_94> not really
[2:48:23] <DracaenaLeaf> He sent Kun lao to his death
[2:48:24] <%Remery_> Literally "NU UH"
[2:48:25] <%fFailureatlife> Liu kang started it tho
[2:48:25] <ScreamingMeat> Liu Kang's death was kinda his own fault
[2:48:26] <+Grayhammatter> liu got destroyed
[2:48:26] <%AncelDeLambert> it's VERY funny attempting to pretend the plot matters
[2:48:28] <%Kataguro> Use the punch and the kick
[2:48:29] <GizmoKSX> It was more a really, really stupid accident
[2:48:32] <%RedMageRebel> Liu was an accident tho
[2:48:33] <$MonsterEnvy> No it was a mistake and an accident
[2:48:33] <MasterTonberry23> He totally murdered Liu, and could have saved Kung but didnt because he wasnt paying attention
[2:48:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Liu Kang was the one that got buttmad
[2:48:35] <%BayowolfTerra> liu Kang was big murdered, everyone else was gross incompetence
[2:48:36] <Pairoschuz> kung lao got punked by shao khan cause he got pissed
[2:48:37] <+shinpete> Raiden didn't murder him. It was a total accident
[2:48:40] <Guntherkiin> Have you played as jax yet?
[2:48:41] <jastrouble97> how did Kang die again
[2:48:42] <Dementedpenguin> So is Jade gonna walk away too and come back a second later? Kappa

[2:48:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kung Lao died because he doesnt pay attention
[2:48:47] <bendatron> lui kang was just stupid justly stupid
[2:48:48] <VritraReiRei> wait did he just throw the body of a monk?
[2:48:48] <Run44forrest> liu kang got left in the microwave for too long
[2:48:48] <energywarning> oh so that's the flame jets
[2:48:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mean

[2:48:57] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> "Kritikal"
[2:48:59] <+ryujinran> Raiden did nothing wrong
[2:49:02] <%yoshkosh20> wasn't it like self defense that got a bit outta hand. the fight between raiden and liu?
[2:49:03] <%goose_attack_almanac> Okay so Raiden didn't "Murder" Liu Kang. He just Manslaughtered him
[2:49:06] <Madnoob23> This game looks pretty violent, Should I buy it for my 14 year old daughter?
[2:49:06] <majindusto> Liu Kang Screwed Liu Kang
[2:49:07] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat in fairness, Liu tried to use his death punch on Raiden, and Raiden was CLEARLY covering his face and acting non-offensively. Liu brought it on himself by having the hubris to try and strike down a god.
[2:49:08] <mayorrev> I bet there's a stage fatality for that booby trap
[2:49:09] <%Birdigalore> I like how Scorpion literally fucked off to get big mam Jade to fight his battle for him
[2:49:10] <a_mad_dragon> raiden did EVERYTHING wrong
[2:49:10] <%patriotrenegade> tbf to Raiden it was self-defence
[2:49:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Raiden parried Liu Kang's attack tho
[2:49:15] <+DrunkenDice> Shao Kahn did nothing wrong :)
[2:49:19] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Enemies should not be allowed to taunt unless they;re winning

[2:53:46] <+TruKiryu> I am the shadow, your true self.
[2:53:47] <%Hilleltaco> "You're not me, YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE ME"
[2:53:47] <InsomniacPersona> No Liu Kang wanted to push Shao Kahn back to Outworld and fight him, which Elder gods wouldnt have intervened and Kiu and Raiden would've died then
[2:53:48] <a_mad_dragon> says every adult about their teenage selves
[2:53:48] <sjcodan> Johny Cage MUST WIN
[2:53:49] <Baconrath> mirror match lets gooo
[2:53:49] <MasterTonberry23> Evil Liu Kang, still proving he's a million times better than hero Liu Kang
[2:53:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Liu, you can stop these guys without being a massive TOOL
[2:53:50] <JSebz> Raiden had to stand his realm
[2:53:50] <%Kduff89> you are both equally ignorant
[2:53:51] <SovPho> Lord Raiden lives in Florida, which is a stand your ground state
[2:53:53] <gorillahandz> is this Persona
[2:53:53] <$Brother_Coduss> that moment when you side with basically satan
[2:53:54] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Shadowboxin
[2:53:56] <TeefTwo> liu so fast
[2:53:59] <Chumblago13> Raiden messed up but he didn't blatantly purposely murder Raiden and there was no glory involved.
[2:54:00] <+MrDizazta> Face myself
[2:54:00] <secretbosssauce> Extreme Self-harm
[2:54:01] <+AsylumGC8> $20 says Liu Kang wins....who's in?
[2:54:02] <+ryujinran> so i guess pat isn’t a raiden fan huh
[2:54:03] <thewhiterice92> PAT NO IT ISNT
[2:54:03] <%DedlokPM> Nekron MUST WIN mogsLOUD
[2:54:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Liu has the toxoplasmosis.
[2:54:04] <%AncelDeLambert> looks like armor slows your ass down
[2:54:05] <Chumblago13> so that's neat
[2:54:06] <DracaenaLeaf> Wa
[2:54:06] <%Remery_> Ow my chest
[2:54:09] <dekkitout> I want them to clash bicycle kicks like it's a Jojo fight
[2:54:15] <Jolly_Adventurer> I really like Lui Kang's "80's action hero" look he has going on
[2:54:16] <Exicuren> Shao Kahn needed to merge the realms so he could be destroyed
[2:54:16] <+MrDizazta> Liu Kang's Persona is what?
[2:54:18] <GalacticSpecter> I love how Pat is just agreeing with the revenants
[2:54:18] <%Jetsfantasy> Will young Liu Kang get stronger for defeating his shadow?
[2:54:20] <SovPho> why is patently better liu kang getting his ass beat
[2:54:20] <Gorgen> his jaw is on the floor
[2:54:26] <haveswordmuststing> @dekkitout like God Hand?
[2:54:27] <ScreamingMeat> Evil Liu Kang should have cool lightening scars
[2:54:30] <+iwasJase> is @AngriestPat more comfortable using pad when playing MK over stick?
[2:54:33] <%Intersceptre> woolieWHENS woolieYE
[2:54:34] <alexandrecau> raiden tried selling souls to quan chi shut up about self defense
[2:54:35] <Belutima> I love that the bicycle kick sound is back
[2:54:37] <vampireinarm> wouldnt be surprised if those were the exact same voice clips Dante uses when he uses King Cerberus
[2:54:38] <%QueequegTheater> @SovPho Because Good Liu Kang is younger and stronger
[2:54:39] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @iwasJase yeah
[2:54:39] <Kefkaisnotamused> Evil Liu jobbing.
[2:54:40] <GizmoKSX> Revenant has cooler armor, but human has plot armor
[2:54:40] <haveswordmuststing> it halfway happens there
[2:54:41] <HeadsHeldHigh> watototototototoo
[2:54:47] <%Birdigalore> Evil Liu: I hear Raiden touches little boys and lied on his tax returns!
[2:54:49] <Madnoob23> Don't worry, This game will probably get rid of the entire story of MK9 is my guess.
[2:54:51] <ekozu_3> mk was built for pad tho
[2:54:51] <majindusto> KILL THE FUTURE
[2:54:52] <+iwasJase> fair enough
[2:54:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Bitches
[2:54:53] <dekkitout> Like whatever, I just want bicycle kicks to clash

[3:10:06] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat thats just Smoke
[3:10:06] <GypsySquid> Cyber Scorpion, basically Smoke.
[3:10:06] <falconx9k> Takeda basically

[3:10:10] <Echelon_94> cyborg noob pls
[3:10:11] <energywarning> honestly, i try not to dedicate too much brain power to MK in general
[3:10:11] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat cyber scorpion is just MK3 Smoke
[3:10:11] <vampireinarm> "we have to walk away from the cutscene and into the stage before we fight"
[3:10:12] <%Jetsfantasy> Slightly different yellow cyrax
[3:10:12] <AzureInTheDark> UMK3 Smoke is literally Cyber Scorpion
[3:10:14] <+TruKiryu> I perfer my scorpion, human, thank you
[3:10:14] <+VashyronM> Cyber Revenant Scorpion
[3:10:14] <jamesofn> but what colour would he be when Cyrax took yellow
[3:10:14] <Exicuren> Well, just look at the background
[3:10:15] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Corporate_Redeemer)
[3:10:16] <%QueequegTheater> @AscheRichard Everyone is robots
[3:10:16] <%DigitalJoshie> isn't that just smoke tho?
[3:10:17] <metabot64> WHAT COLOR WOULD HE BE

[3:10:18] <KungFooMaen> Cyber everyone
[3:10:19] <%MagickBurritoh> I like the robot ponytail
[3:10:19] <ScreamingMeat> REVENANT Cyborg Scorpion
[3:10:19] <Kefkaisnotamused> Sektor is red.
[3:10:20] <%Mornaka> When i was a kid, i thought Cyrax WAS cyber scorpion
[3:10:22] <horsesaredumb> why lose?
[3:10:23] <%valriot> Nooborg
[3:10:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He actually has a moveset
[3:10:24] <sdbzdb> But is Cyber Scorpion cooler than Skeletopn Scorpion?
[3:10:24] <oAznoUta> I'm too busy over here thinking about Cyber Noob Saibot
[3:10:25] <BreakersAweigh> I miss smoke
[3:10:30] <ShinobiPhoenix> but Cyber Scorpion is just Smoke
[3:10:31] <dekkitout> Takeda was pretty rad too
[3:10:33] <MasterTonberry23> So is Cyrax using his MK9 moveset?
[3:10:34] <physicaldepression> cyrax could be a secret character
[3:10:36] <majindusto> SO MUCH YELLOW
[3:10:36] <physicaldepression> imagine that
[3:10:39] <%Niney_Who> He isn't a character right? What's his super
[3:10:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> so is this scorpion still an undead
[3:10:40] <+Uttrik> waiiiit, what would cyrax's fatal blow be?

[3:10:48] <%Niney_Who> Let us see his final blowww
[3:10:52] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> what makes scorpion awesome is all his sick hellfire stuff, which he'd lose if he was an emotionless robot
[3:10:57] <mayorrev> CMERE
[3:10:58] <%yoshkosh20> it's chakra.

[3:11:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Wellllll
[3:11:19] <Kefkaisnotamused> Yeah, weirdly he kept his link with hell due to his time being a slave to it.

[3:11:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat If I remember correctly, I think Scorpion defeated his Revenant spirit or something so he can still use hellfire without becoming a huge vengeance man

[3:33:13] <%FrostMass22> Max has subs only for chat
[3:33:15] <%BayowolfTerra> writings is kinda plot holey, but it feels very fun.
[3:33:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> sounds like an MK game
[3:33:27] <Son_Goku135> @thatguyfrommars It’s in sub mode for now
[3:33:27] <%FrostMass22> I would love to see what 26k people would have to say tho
[3:33:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> dicks and fucks
[3:33:50] <$Lord__Ainz> Max is in Sub only mode, just a heads up
[3:33:51] <@lewdskeletor13> Probably complain about a certain kulture
[3:33:55] <%FrostMass22> @BayowolfTerra The fact that Liu Kang and Kung Lao were not killed during the time stop may be the worst writing I've seen in a fighting game
[3:34:05] <%FrostMass22> @lewdskeletor13 Stop talking about boner culture
[3:34:07] <%laserbeaming> Max's stream doesn't have creepy eyeballs

[3:34:49] <Sunstalker> What a good time to join FeelsBadMan
[3:34:59] <%laserbeaming> in the future
[3:35:03] <%BayowolfTerra> @frostmass22 Agreed. the. again, I've never liked the "don't kill them, we"ll need then for the future" trope unless REALLY earned.
[3:35:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Poor Cyrax got it rough
[3:35:12] <%nitronLVIII> man i cant till pat sees the rnding tho
[3:35:15] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Reminder that Skullgirls had a “core values” patch to class up some of the character frames from just being tasteless. It was received well. Times have changed a lot.
[3:35:22] <%nitronLVIII> cant wait*
[3:35:36] <%laserbeaming> I want Human Cyrax. I liked him so much more as a ninja
[3:35:37] <%FrostMass22> And it was stupid then

[3:37:23] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat yo did you catch that when lui kang was telling kung lao about the traps to expect, he was listing off all of the environment hazards from the shaolin monks game the chapter was named after?
[3:37:33] <%AncelDeLambert> any earlier and I'll be at work while you start streaming
[3:37:44] <+SirFailsAlott> @TheMilhouseExperience the name isn't but their status is pretty important, no?

[3:38:52] <DadStopPls> did the game already officially release on ps4 and xbox
[3:38:53] <gekizenbu> Go to a psych dude
[3:38:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat is not a therapist
[3:38:59] <marvel877> ooof
[3:39:00] <%mercado94> not this shit again
[3:39:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Getting help is the first step to getting better
[3:39:02] <px120> OIF
[3:39:03] <gekizenbu> like, drag your ass to a psych
[3:39:05] <%Chichen> Streamers arent therapists
[3:39:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> But I LOVE depression
[3:39:06] <px120> Oof
[3:39:07] <+SirFailsAlott> Stop bothering people with your shit and get help
[3:39:08] <Shalderave> Don't use bad internet entertainment as a crutch
[3:39:14] <%laserbeaming> teatheSadcat
[3:39:14] <%FrostMass22> @SirFailsAlott Now I'm confused. So was Skullgirls patching the game's content a mistake. or is that not your view?
[3:39:15] <TheBlankAce> Kirby this isn't about what you like, see a doctor
[3:39:15] <hntronium> F
[3:39:16] <%SaltyDongs> Big oof
[3:39:18] <DracaenaLeaf> Thanks five
[3:39:20] <%Piemen99> F
[3:39:20] <globalGinnicide> so does anyone else think that the time lady in this looks like the thumb people from spy kids?
[3:39:24] <ArtThouBored> Thank you money!
[3:39:25] <$RubberFistFight> Kirby, coming from someone who let their own problems go undiagnosed for FAR too long and has paid for it, your mind ain't right - go get it seen to. There's no shame in it.
[3:39:27] <ragingsystem> Streamers ain't your therapist bro.
[3:39:28] <lloyddboy> pat doing a theater thing
[3:39:31] <HeadsHeldHigh> @globalGinnicide LUL
[3:39:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat dropped out of psychology remember
[3:39:45] <ArtThouBored> Yeah
[3:39:45] <Run44forrest> pat cant prescribe drugs
[3:39:48] <+SirFailsAlott> @FrostMass22 yes it was, from the company that hired zone for making a good porn
[3:39:50] <@lewdskeletor13> Shake that bag!
[3:39:54] <ArtThouBored> This is my second main behind Baraka
[3:39:54] <%bevyrage> i like this guy
[3:40:08] <DracaenaLeaf> MeOWwww
[3:40:09] <ArtThouBored> You should take a look at his moves and outros
[3:40:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> @RubberFistFight it's a depression born of genetics and logic. nothing i want to do to fix that
[3:40:15] <%BayowolfTerra> those some distracting arms
[3:40:17] <%SaltyDongs> Asuras jax
[3:40:20] <%bevyrage> kollector looks to have spinal's souls mechanic in his theft system
[3:40:21] <HeadsHeldHigh> Dude can give SIX handjobs
[3:40:22] <ArtThouBored> You get put in the bag alive or dead
[3:40:23] <%FancyHatMan> remember when pat dropped out of psych :D
[3:40:31] <%bevyrage> also looks to have a good projectile rushdown game
[3:40:34] <%Hilleltaco> @SirFailsAlott I think it was confirmed at some point that the porn wasn't a factor in Zone getting hired, or at least not the Skullgirls animation
[3:40:36] <%FrostMass22> @SirFailsAlott For clarification, do you then mean that the company shouldn't have hired Zone since they knew the content Zone made if they were going to get fussy about it?
[3:40:37] <ArtThouBored> It's still just as dumb
[3:40:39] <+SirFailsAlott> @Kirby_Sauce stop bring others down if you don't want help
[3:40:41] <%Kazooki_Kazami> with a hint of sarcasm a little
[3:40:48] <$RubberFistFight> @Kirby_Sauce which is exactly what I said right up until the point that I realised I couldn't live like that anymore. GET. YOURSELF. TREATED.
[3:40:50] <ArtThouBored> But that's both a negative and a positive
[3:40:52] <Caidezes> The writing got dumber, actually.
[3:41:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> @SirFailsAlott not trying to, I was proving a point from the last stream
[3:41:10] <@lewdskeletor13> It might make sense later
[3:41:14] <@lewdskeletor13> Just saying
[3:41:16] <HeadsHeldHigh> Time plots are not something to make sense of
[3:41:16] <%Kazooki_Kazami> get sleep my guy
[3:41:17] <%Ne1son> Seems not as good in the writing dept as MK9
[3:41:18] <ArtThouBored> @lewdskeletor13 naaaaaahhhhhh
[3:41:18] <%laserbeaming> @SirFailsAlott Let's avoid calling people out like that. Might make things worse.
[3:41:35] <ProfBadger> I mean, the revenants don't like Raiden, which is why they side with Kronika.
[3:41:36] <+SirFailsAlott> @laserbeaming some people need a wakeup call man
[3:41:37] <GypsySquid> Well, by her logic, the revenants are the absolute worst people to fight themselves, 'cause what happens if they win and accidentally kill themselves?
[3:41:38] <%Rngiddion> possibly that if they killed the old versions the netherealm army of mooks might fuck off or something
[3:41:38] <ArtThouBored> While I love MK the story is not something you seriously think about for too long
[3:41:47] <+trashamn> pway ff12 tho
[3:41:49] <%Naho_Saenoki> @AngriestPat If the revenant versions disappear, there's no one leading the Netherrealm armies anymore.
[3:41:49] <milleniumfalcon69> I just joined have i missed the stream???
[3:41:51] <+Eclipse_knight_> just kill the younger ones and make the revenants
[3:41:57] <Run44forrest> ye strean over
[3:41:59] <%BayowolfTerra> I don't know how to do sub messages. I'll figure it out.
[3:42:03] <ArtThouBored> It's almost like Tekken 7 but not as bad as Tournaments are held every month/week
[3:42:03] <milleniumfalcon69> FUCC
[3:42:06] <ProfBadger> the old versions are Raiden loyal, because he hasn't fucked up hard enough yet.
[3:42:12] <+SirFailsAlott> @FrostMass22 I think it's just silly that they hire them and then years down the line decide that they have morals to uphold
[3:42:13] <DracaenaLeaf> well happy bday now
[3:42:18] <%Chichen> @BayowolfTerra its on resubs. It'll show a "SHARE" message in chat.
[3:42:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> @RubberFistFight and i say: FUCK THAT. I just don't like being alive, same how some people don't like broccoli
[3:42:20] <%laserbeaming> @SirFailsAlott It's not our choice to take. Better safe than sorry.
[3:42:35] <%BayowolfTerra> ok, that makes sense, thank you.
[3:42:40] <HeadsHeldHigh> Lol
[3:42:42] <$FuriousJohn87> I just learned what the bosses name in MK11 is and it's fucking stupid Kronica is the worlds least creative name.
[3:42:45] <$yves_is_online> monkaS
[3:42:45] <$RubberFistFight> @Kirby_Sauce fine, be like that. Don't drag it into someone's stream the way you do then.
[3:42:48] <%Kazooki_Kazami> is it just fate
[3:42:50] <%FrostMass22> @SirFailsAlott Got it, I just wanted to be sure I understood what you meant. I agree.
[3:42:54] <%Rngiddion> but its a rare jpeg
[3:42:55] <GPAlpha> Ah yes, the Gacha Gulag
[3:42:56] <@lewdskeletor13> Kirby we don’t need to hear this
[3:42:56] <+Shastafield> LUL
[3:43:01] <%Over_ninek> An absolutely justified move.
[3:43:01] <GypsySquid> It's a jpeg with STATS. :V
[3:43:03] <HeadsHeldHigh> gotta get those collectible waifus
[3:43:09] <%BayowolfTerra> I. deep into fate grand order. but I haven't spent money on it in half a year, so progress.
[3:43:13] <%Hilleltaco> @SirFailsAlott People really overstate the animation changes. It was like a few frames changed because they were unnecessary/didn't make sense, 99% of the panty shots are still there
[3:43:15] <DadStopPls> hats are just a 3d model
[3:43:16] <%Ranryu692> the demons make me play the gacha gsmes
