[0:26:31] <leole11> i've failed college, then i reenrolled, and now i'm top of my class
[0:26:31] <$TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer600 Heyo, my favorite red-headed chucklefucks! Here's some new bits from my new MANAGER job at the fuel station I STARTED at as a peon! Which is also why I missed Paige's stream (stream on a Wednesday and Thursday for once you mustard-guzzling dork) Also, help Pat's self-esteem to increase his Big Dick Energy.
[0:26:32] <crashrox92> Tell us how that makes you feel??
[0:26:33] <Bailey__gaming> Finally caught a pat/Paige stream live! @angriestpat hope you are good
[0:26:33] <+Fenlig> super early for pat!
[0:26:33] <leole11> just chill
[0:26:33] <+skramms> except you only met the people through college
[0:26:34] <element_of_loyalty> ABUSE
[0:26:34] <xIgnitionCrowx> Fr
[0:26:36] <+Tbnero> hello you guys
[0:26:38] <+king_of_beggars> It's also hard to fail college because they've become glorified day cares for the middle class.
[0:26:39] <Prism_Wing> Graduating leads to failure for most people nowdays.
[0:26:40] <%jediwatchman11> Seriously, go the fuck to class
[0:26:41] <arcadeking48> In particular, these days college can hurt more than it helps. Spend shit tons of money for a degree that's useless!
[0:26:44] <SchroedingersFerret> Don't ask these scrubs about college
[0:26:45] <BionicPulga> Yo.
[0:26:48] <Flyrant> don't bother with college, it's a waste of time
[0:26:51] <$SGrim> Note: don't go to college unless you have a career path in mind. You will fuck yourself by being indecisive.
[0:26:51] <xIgnitionCrowx> Life is circumstantial for the most part.
[0:26:56] <element_of_loyalty> I wanna be able to loose my hand in Elmo fur
[0:26:58] <xdeathknightx> half of it is not playing Third Strike in college with your friends Kappa
[0:27:03] <+yetionayacht> pat
[0:27:04] <%PatNTheHat> The OTHER half is making the professors like you.
[0:27:04] <Avatar_Beifong> Unless it's medical then fuck

[0:27:06] <crashrox92> Omg that tail is so poofy

[0:27:11] <Mr_Strut> But if you were super cool, you'd skip and pass anyway.
[0:27:12] <Gorgen> i want to stick my faec in Elmos belly
[0:27:12] <raven_frame> The way to do college is to just do it.
[0:27:14] <studleydoorite> did Pat go to a high school and think it was college?
[0:27:15] <god_woke> Dont go into insurmountable debt
[0:27:15] <NeonIceCavern> Pay thousands of dollars to just show up
[0:27:17] <+BiggestBuckets> or youll fail college
[0:27:17] <element_of_loyalty> 10/10
[0:27:20] <SatansDick1> pat is big smart
[0:27:21] <TheWeenieZucchini> Thanks, guys! I'm just being anxious for no reason
[0:27:21] <ragasquid> @SGrim can confirm. am indecisive. am also fucked
[0:27:24] <Thalchampz> he licc
[0:27:28] <element_of_loyalty> yes
[0:27:30] <SubliminaIMessages> College is bullshit that you need.
[0:27:37] <absdaddy> you really don't.
[0:27:38] <arcadeking48> Also if you are setup to go to college but don't know what to go for, get a degree in business. Its super generic and useful. Even if it doesn't become a creer, you'll at least be good at money and doing your taxes!

[1:05:44] <%Divryne> MANTISMEN.
[1:05:45] <SatansDick1> o yea
[1:05:46] <%skizzuto> skinny boi
[1:05:49] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> Mantis Lords OP
[1:05:50] <Hydrapissed> ITS paige's village
[1:05:50] <element_of_loyalty> Anne Coulter?

[1:05:53] <Jontman42> We in mantis town now boys
[1:06:00] <$GohanEgret> PSYCHO MANTIS?
[1:06:01] <runningfleet> mantis are so fuckin cool
[1:06:01] <zargy> P O I N T E Y B O E Y
[1:06:05] <%MeAuntieNora> Mantids don't sting
[1:06:06] <Bobbledygook> the wasp is just as much of an asshole as in real life
[1:06:11] <%SomeNEET> Fuckin HATED these thinbois
[1:06:11] <Mr_Strut> They're too strong
[1:06:13] <yukichocomilk> these guys are the coolest
[1:06:13] <TheyCallMeVawn> Does Pat know you can parry?
[1:06:25] <Flyrant> if I didn't like stardust crusaders would I like the rest of Jojo? I liked part 1 and 2
[1:06:32] <%skizzuto> welcome to mantis town
[1:06:35] <+yetionayacht> parry isnt really a thing
[1:06:37] <+yetionayacht> i mean it is
[1:06:41] <+yetionayacht> but it isnt
[1:06:44] <leole11> but it is
[1:06:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Hey Pat don't forget that upgrade at the station
[1:06:49] <Bobbledygook> but it's not
[1:06:50] <yukichocomilk> but it isn't
[1:06:52] <%jediwatchman11> @Flyrant rest of jojo is more part 3 than 1 or 2
[1:06:53] <runningfleet> yeah its better to dodge
[1:06:54] <%BioApple> @Flyrant 4 is my favorite, but they're all different enough that it's tough to compare them
[1:06:56] <$GohanEgret> but it is
[1:06:57] <%PipIV> but then again it is
[1:06:57] <leole11> i mean it is
[1:06:58] <%jediwatchman11> if you didn't like part 3 bail out
[1:06:58] <runningfleet> you get more hits in
[1:07:03] <+KingGilbertIV> @flyrant It depends on what you didn't like in part 3
[1:07:04] <%Divryne> Mantis are a WARRIOR RACE.
[1:07:05] <ArcanumMBD> Mantis men are the true edge lords
[1:07:07] <yukichocomilk> true but it isn't
[1:07:11] <%jediwatchman11> Part 5 is my favorite so I'm the really weird one
[1:07:15] <Flyrant> I didn't like polnareff or the fucking shitty dog
[1:07:17] <%neodeltai> They're like pre-STD Klingons.
[1:07:20] <leole11> yeah but at the same time it is
[1:07:21] <blockedL> its more like a clash
[1:07:23] <MrDrayko> Hey Pat, any opinions on aa dumb leak i saw today that said that MvC:I is getting ported to the switch? cheer200
[1:07:24] <Bobbledygook> the dick plant palace
[1:07:31] <$GohanEgret> but it really isn't
[1:07:32] <leole11> a parry is a type of clash, if you think about it
[1:07:33] <Parapattern> The hubris
[1:07:34] <$nademonkey1100> wonder what ending he is going to get
[1:07:37] <%PipIV> but on the other hand it is
[1:07:39] <yukichocomilk> good points 🤔
[1:07:40] <Flyrant> thanks for the answers guys
[1:07:44] <SwindlerOfProgress> @Flyrant I think so. SC was him still trying to figure out stands. I don't love SC either, but Part 4 is great. If you don't like 4, the rest of Jojo's probably not for you.
[1:07:51] <leole11> go DOWN pat
[1:07:54] <+Gooniekorn> yea that aint happening
[1:07:56] <Bobbledygook> but in one aspect it isn't
[1:08:01] <$GohanEgret> that game is DEAD
[1:08:01] <%jediwatchman11> MvCI is dead
[1:08:02] <+GrimSquirrel> But smash bros though
[1:08:02] <+yetionayacht> this mad man needs to heal

[1:10:41] <%MisterCrimson> Man, wait til he gets Time Stop
[1:10:41] <Nemesisnick33> cup head is hideous theres a reason no one uses that art style anymore
[1:10:42] <arcadeking48> @AngriestPat Its oversaturation. A lot of Indie games have artstyles like this and it all kinda blends together. Not this specifically, but the general cartoony aesthetic.
[1:10:44] <$GohanEgret> buckle it?!
[1:10:47] <+GrimSquirrel> no pat you killed a whole village to unlock that room
[1:10:49] <+nolifegamin> now this is where the real Hollow Knight starts

[1:10:50] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Alright listen, you're about to do something that you can very much do now, but don't progress past it
[1:10:51] <dekkitout> cuphead is about you and a pal claiming souls for satan, if that aint edge than what is
[1:10:52] <Bouldus> kinda
[1:10:53] <Mr_Strut> More of a pants buckle

[1:11:00] <Flyrant> wouldn't all the blood get stuck in the dick if you tied a belt around it
[1:11:05] <Jontman42> Was that a readable on the wall
[1:11:07] <Bouldus> i mean it stops your dick falling out

[1:11:13] <RoosterSauces> the buckle doesnt go on your weiner
[1:11:14] <%bluetocho13> he thinks the jump is the best part, its the sliding down walls that is the best
[1:11:16] <Kavtech> @SchroedingersFerret True.

[1:15:44] <asbestosflavored> CoolStoryBob
[1:15:48] <frozenottsel> Since we're on the subject of ants, AntsCanada is a super great youtube channel if you want to learn about ants
[1:15:48] <+FadingEmber> Why do you know this?
[1:15:49] <+Kawaso> free notch is wasted
[1:15:52] <MrLittleSam> Ants was cool.
[1:15:55] <+yetionayacht> yum
[1:15:58] <sangi53> the princess ants usually move out of their nest
[1:15:58] <leole11> HERE WE GO
[1:16:00] <+AntithesisEK> they make their own colonies
[1:16:05] <%jediwatchman11> why does Paige know so much about ants
[1:16:05] <+Sp3ctre48> because ants pat
[1:16:07] <+trekkie11041> Paige is wrong sbfpPat
[1:16:08] <EVA_Unit02> Because the Queen Ant is PAIGE
[1:16:08] <Ell1ot> ants get hungry too, Pat
[1:16:08] <dekkitout> queen cant have no hussies show her up yo
[1:16:09] <+th3madness> antz was definitely not disney/pixar
[1:16:11] <%Divryne> Cause they can be the only puss.
[1:16:11] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> Because nature is dumb

[1:16:16] <Mr_Strut> The mantis was the best x files monster
[1:16:16] <HibiscusMist> @AngriestPat Some ant species actually have multiple queens producing for the colony
[1:16:16] <Domonomin> Nature is dumb...
[1:16:17] <+CandideCamera> Sometimes you just gotta eat your babies
[1:16:17] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> and you can't choose the gender
[1:16:17] <+d00msdaydan> wait i wasn't paying attention, are they talking about bugs or britain?

[1:16:44] <Mr_Strut> If you want the real shit, look at bees.
[1:16:45] <powerprotoman> thats not a double jump
[1:16:48] <xeros720> i trust Paige more about Aunts

[1:16:51] <randomp141> Some colonies do have multiple queens
[1:16:53] <%PipIV> apatWrong that you're wrong

[1:17:08] <KekFrog> I think the "baby queen ant" does that by its self when it reaches a certain point.
[1:17:10] <%WorthlessSamurai> When are we gonna get SimAnt HD Remaster? Kappa
[1:17:10] <definitelynotyakra> sometimes the queen get hangry

[1:24:43] <+FadingEmber> Why homeless tho?
[1:24:44] <%MeAuntieNora> That's a very Gerstmann fear
[1:24:45] <$GohanEgret> sigh
[1:24:49] <%Cranky_Construct> So you're saying I should bring an empty syringe to magfest then
[1:24:50] <+yetionayacht> beecause
[1:24:51] <Jontman42> It's not an actual bee
[1:24:52] <zal_silverfang> never going to California then
[1:24:52] <Mr_Strut> Maybe his talisman should be a homeless person.
[1:24:54] <bracketmanps> Pat's actual talisman is a homeless person it sounds like
[1:24:56] <Hydrapissed> its a talisman not a actual SYRINGE
[1:24:58] <definitelynotyakra> Pat, I think you have a really unrealistic idea of what motivates homeless people
[1:24:59] <+seaearthandsky> pat you are a strange strange man LUL
[1:25:00] <%jediwatchman11> @MeAuntieNora now that you mention it, that is very Gerstmann esque
[1:25:00] <%WorthlessSamurai> 🤔
[1:25:01] <Flyrant> wouldn't a bee attract more bees?
[1:25:02] <+AntithesisEK> while you were studying the bee, the homeless person studies the syringe.
[1:25:02] <arcadeking48> Why does Pat hate homeless people?
[1:25:02] <%neodeltai> There he is.
[1:25:02] <Hydrapissed> hey its best lad

[1:25:08] <+FadingEmber> @AngriestPat Why homeless tho?
[1:25:08] <circular7> perfect sense
[1:25:08] <TalisKanju> Pat must LOVE jellyfish
[1:25:11] <%Cranky_Construct> just use it as leverage to get pat around the con
[1:25:12] <%PipIV> but it doesn't work for you
[1:25:17] <epylepticpanda> SOLAIRE
[1:25:19] <%BioApple> NAILSMITH
[1:25:27] <TalisKanju> Jellyfish are practically made of syringes

[1:25:33] <blockedL> you can beat them anyway tho
[1:25:34] <%MeAuntieNora> @jediwatchman11 He has talked about basically that exact scenario! I think the phrase "stab me with drugs!" has been used before hahah
[1:25:34] <Majiinbooh> thats bs the fight here is super doable with the lvl 1 nail
[1:25:39] <Jontman42> "Yeah don't have to beat that tough boss yet" - Says game
[1:25:44] <%rdark_ksu> It can just be a picture of a syringe
[1:25:46] <+AntithesisEK> scare the syringes away
[1:25:47] <+yetionayacht> fuck the nailsmith, get good
[1:25:52] <AtlasMcCoy> @Majiinbooh Ye but having a better nail makes it less hard
[1:25:55] <definitelynotyakra> But do you, Pat? How do you know the insulin isn't filled with poison?
[1:25:56] <TyrantSlime> Pat's fear isn't a syringe. It's the mystery fluid within
[1:25:57] <+Kawaso> wat
[1:25:57] <Hydrapissed> pat is insane
[1:25:57] <gunstar73> mantis lords ate free yall trash
[1:25:58] <Hydrapissed> like legit
[1:25:59] <%BioApple> pat knows all about syrettes from his morphine habit
[1:25:59] <Twoiis> Will you REALLY know what's in the syringe?
[1:26:00] <Flyrant> death inc
[1:26:00] <+NWR_James> Pat is weirdly right
[1:26:02] <Gorgen> f
[1:26:02] <KekFrog> What if the talisman is an oral syringe, is that close enough to ward off big boy syringes?
[1:26:02] <Hydrapissed> very very insane
[1:26:03] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> Just fill the syringe with blood plasma
[1:26:08] <%PipIV> 2 different things
[1:26:11] <zargy> THE MADMAN
[1:26:12] <frozenottsel> Like a serette of morphine?
[1:26:18] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> as a diabetic person, pat is literally insane
[1:26:19] <Prism_Wing> Bladed Birthday?
[1:26:20] <runningfleet> the fight is kinda long with lv1 nail
[1:26:22] <TalisKanju> It's difficult to put something back into a syrette
[1:26:23] <+filthyheretichorus> @AngriestPat I have type 2 and I take pills instead of needles
[1:26:24] <%PipIV> @frozenottsel essentially
[1:26:26] <studleydoorite> im going to cosplay as a syringe at the next con you go to
[1:26:28] <+FadingEmber> What is this weird obsession with the homeless?
[1:26:29] <Gehtingsberg> Wall cheat
[1:26:29] <$vinnybushes> @AngriestPat does that mean your least favorite heath action in the yakuza games is the one for the mysterious syringe?
[1:26:29] <$GohanEgret> who trashed my dead shadowman's grave
[1:26:33] <randomp141> Pat needs a syringe filled with air.
[1:26:37] <%BillyMaze> Why does pat always have an intricate explanation for his insanity
[1:26:38] <Jontman42> Might wanna put a boss marker there
[1:26:43] <SwindlerOfProgress> That usually only happens for bosses so you have a decent chance to get your money back.
[1:26:45] <+TeethMuncher> But the crimes feel so good!
[1:26:45] <%Trekalone> it's purely dependent on the room
[1:26:48] <+yetionayacht> will pat be a big man and beat the mantis boys with the old nail

[1:26:50] <+Comrade_Vladof> Just rob a bank, and then donate it all to Pat

[1:26:55] <epylepticpanda> yeah what pat said

[1:44:13] <Jontman42> Look at the map, look what's above you
[1:44:13] <SwindlerOfProgress> No, that guy looks way bigger.
[1:44:13] <KilljoyHexx> we are all the hollow knights
[1:44:14] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:44:15] <%maskedriderhero> We truly were, the Hollow Knight
[1:44:17] <+resstarr> Water doesn't hurt, just acid

[1:44:22] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @arcadeking48 OK cool I just started ff14 and it doesn't seem as bad as Maplestory
[1:44:23] <Hydrapissed> WE ARE the hyper light

[1:44:38] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> the real hollow knight were the bugs we killed along the way
[1:44:38] <%TenderBabyBacon> The hollow knight is the friends we made along the way
[1:44:40] <%jediwatchman11> The true hollow knight was the friends we made along the way
[1:44:46] <+Shaggnar> The real hollow knight was the friends we made along the way
[1:44:46] <SirSmudgey> fasttravel in this game suck tbh

[1:45:04] <SwindlerOfProgress> @fazoburquina Not at the moment, at least. Not sure if he'll need it later.
[1:45:10] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @flyrant would be nice if it was free to play up to a certain point
[1:45:15] <%Agami23> the true hollow knight was the friends we made along the way
[1:45:15] <gslayer14> The true hollow knight was the hollows we knighted along the bug
[1:45:26] <%Agami23> lol.

[1:45:38] <arcadeking48> @CharileMurphyPendelton Once you get to the really grindy part of 14, you only have to grind for a little bit before you can branch out more. Raids, 24-mans, and dungeons all give perfectly serviceable gear and you can get a lot of loot currency once your roulettes all unlock.

[1:52:30] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> It became too much like a relationship so he bailed.
[1:52:34] <Namboto> @Shooterboy23 why not both?
[1:52:35] <Shooterboy23> Liking Haru is a meme, nobody actually likes her.
[1:52:36] <TalisKanju> Way better than Makoto or Futaba
[1:52:36] <%MrMcCrabby> stop saying kumakawa sbfpPat

[1:53:10] <%bluetocho13> kawacummies
[1:53:12] <Shooterboy23> Haru has a great moveset that is mitigated by her being a shitty character
[1:53:12] <Flyrant> wut
[1:53:14] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> You're at the beginning right now
[1:53:15] <TalisKanju> You really can't go wrong with any choice in that game. Unless it's Ann.

[1:53:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Down the elevator, mid jump to the platform
[1:53:31] <Flyrant> Haru better than Makoto at least

[1:53:39] <stigna1> Hey @AngriestPat, there's secret/easter egg in this game that you have to SWEAR to check out when the time comes.

[1:53:55] <MyNameIsRasus> No map
[1:54:02] <oruandrew> what a squish
[1:54:03] <$SGrim> @TalisKanju but you could also go with Ann strictly to cuck the cat. rooShrug
[1:54:03] <TalisKanju> Haru is FAR BEYOND the likes of Yukiko and Yukari
[1:54:05] <$Tredecian> i think the shadow showes up
[1:54:06] <%Press_X_ToJASON> @jediwatchman11 take out makoto entirely and you're good
[1:54:07] <Shooterboy23> they're pretty huge

[2:03:18] <%Paralurx> apatBig apatWrong apatBig
[2:03:22] <+Comrade_Vladof> Illinois was a part of the Union, they just weren't super happy about it
[2:03:23] <Them00n> Sorry Paige but I'm not trusting a lady who took 10 hours to beat portal.
[2:03:26] <ragasquid> "yo what up slaves" Paige, 2018

[2:03:32] <+csisson147> @stigna1 ok cool, thanks
[2:03:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "Yo, what up! Slaves n' stuff!" --Paige.
[2:03:33] <jinkipng> yo waddup slaves and stuff - real humans in 1865
[2:03:34] <%jediwatchman11> Illinois was firmly Union. Missouri didn't secede
[2:03:35] <element_of_loyalty> CHI GETS SNOW AND SNOW IS NOT IN SOUTH
[2:03:36] <AtlasMcCoy> F
[2:03:37] <Spydurman> South = states that fought for slaves, North = fought against Confeds, Midwest = joined later, West = potheads
[2:03:38] <+megaotter> that is factually ioncorrect
[2:03:38] <corepool> i guess paige makes sense if u really separate the south and the deep south
[2:03:39] <Hydrapissed> 1 2 3 DeD
[2:03:39] <Flyrant> damn pat is bad
[2:03:40] <Gorgen> Ohio belongs to the Nords!

[2:03:49] <+blewbeary> Illinois is Lincoln’s state!!!!!

[2:04:04] <Psych_man13_13> Your actually wrong Paige
[2:04:06] <dewyweb> the Civil War never happened anyway so who gives a shit
[2:04:07] <SatansDick1> illinoise is lincoln land
[2:04:08] <%Press_X_ToJASON> @corepool nope, making the entire actual south "deep south" doesnt make the north the south
[2:04:10] <element_of_loyalty> MUFFINS ARE NOT CAKES
[2:04:11] <TheStrongBanana> Paige is my source for all my facts and info
[2:04:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Imperials suck ass too though
[2:04:13] <SubliminaIMessages> Ulysses was a president ya filthy Canadian
[2:04:14] <Brainworm205> PAT AND PAIGE ARE WRONG. WOWWOWOW SHOCKER
[2:04:14] <dekkitout> the stormcloaks and the union, yes, who can forget when tultius freed the slaves
[2:04:18] <+OranHexthief> fairly certain she is just superimposing virgina and west virginia onto her home state
[2:04:19] <$SGrim> I come to this stream for the repeated assurances of completely incorrect statements said with supreme confidence. rooKek
[2:04:21] <Flyrant> pat on tilt
[2:04:28] <AtlasMcCoy> This is where that long nail would come in handy
[2:04:29] <corepool> @Press_X_ToJASON i'm not saying it is
[2:04:34] <stigna1> I can't wait 'till he figures out how to get a chain-pogo on these boyos.
[2:04:34] <VeryTricky> Were talking about that time where we fought ourselves for some reason
[2:04:36] <TheMilhouseExperience> Crazy Talk activates to smite Paige.
[2:04:36] <%Press_X_ToJASON> @Brainworm205 LUL
[2:04:40] <%skizzuto> Pat, longnail is really useful against those flying dudes
[2:04:41] <SatansDick1> time for break
[2:04:47] <%commanderclaw> Take a break man
[2:04:48] <%DedlokPM> "I am super on tilt" apatDab

[2:04:50] <epylepticpanda> SOMEONE STOP PAIGE
[2:04:51] <Kalcom> what
[2:04:54] <element_of_loyalty> Cairo?
[2:04:57] <%commanderclaw> Don't eat the meal while you can't taste it
[2:04:58] <Gorgen> So is Canada in north or south
[2:04:58] <stigna1> Paigie is in de nile, confirmed.
[2:04:58] <+chimaera24> Paige I think you're thinking of Virginia and West Virginia
[2:04:58] <+Spastic_Luv_Monkey> mob town
[2:04:59] <%JackalKing> The South is actually a clearly defined region, geographically, and it does not include Illinois. Illinois was firmly within the Union and contributed a ton to the Union Army. There are five border states that, despite being in the Union, contributed to the South and Illinois is not part of them
[2:05:01] <Kalcom> DIO IS IN AMERICA
[2:05:05] <%lutefiiisk> guys. i got the mustard shits. pls help
[2:05:07] <Brainworm205> STOP PAIGE’S CRAZY TALK
[2:05:12] <%Press_X_ToJASON> this is paige's "jet moto was really good guys" moment
[2:05:13] <element_of_loyalty> AGREE TO DISAGREE
[2:05:21] <$GohanEgret> @Press_X_ToJASON it was
[2:05:21] <%Press_X_ToJASON> excpet even more demonstably incorrect
[2:05:23] <Hydrapissed> its all south btw
[2:05:23] <%kenpachi9211> Paige as a man who has a history major your wrong
[2:05:26] <%skizzuto> FYI that key follows Zelda rules: breaks on use
[2:05:29] <Brainworm205> THANK YOU @jackalking
[2:05:38] <epylepticpanda> PAIGE CRAZY TALK IS LEVELING UP
[2:05:39] <$Mendin> Time for Pat to open the hatched at the bottom of the city Kappa
[2:05:41] <$birdfella> Teaching time with Paige.
[2:05:42] <%jediwatchman11> @kenpachi9211 grad student in history, I'm losing my fuckin' mind right now
[2:05:42] <ValidVenasaur> you can parry hits if you hit a at the same time they do
[2:05:43] <shurtal> Paige is from the prison down there
[2:05:44] <%BioApple> #NotAllIllinoisans
[2:05:44] <+Saggitori> @angriestpat there is a town named Syria in Virginia
[2:05:45] <SchroedingersFerret> Admit defeat Paige
[2:05:46] <%jediwatchman11> this is actually painful
[2:05:50] <SecksOffender> the confederate flag is also prevalent in Michigan
[2:05:53] <Kalcom> they are blue?!?
[2:05:54] <+barkon345> its prelevant in upsatate new york as well New York is still in the north
[2:05:54] <alcors_wisdom> boy i could tell you stories about what a big stink people roused up here in SC about taking the confederate flag down at the state house
[2:05:54] <shinesparker198> now Pat can go die to the dung beetle boss
[2:06:00] <Flyrant> did Illinois vote for Trump? If it did it's part of the South
[2:06:01] <ragasquid> I've caused such a debate
[2:06:03] <HatingSince87> Technically Paige is dying, Pat. Because of da loops
[2:06:03] <KekFrog> It all depends on how you define "the South" and you can't entirely view a state and all of its citizens at the time as being for or against something.
[2:06:05] <+polaroidjackson> north/south illinois might as well be different states entirely
[2:06:07] <Majiinbooh> fast travel to the right
[2:06:09] <$GohanEgret> @Flyrant nope
[2:06:09] <+OranHexthief> fun fact: while maryland was technically part of the union, the only reason it didn't separate to the confederacy was because the maryland senate was illegally jailed to prevent them from voting to seceded
[2:06:12] <AtlasMcCoy> Learning is for NERDS
[2:06:12] <Rostichenburg> Pat go right
[2:06:13] <ArcanumMBD> no learning allowed
[2:06:13] <%Press_X_ToJASON> @SecksOffender i've seen them in new england, doesnt make us the south
[2:06:18] <+Comrade_Vladof> @Flyrant all of it but Chicago did
[2:06:20] <%DedlokPM> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE! apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:06:20] <+polaroidjackson> you go down south and it gets REAL south real quick
[2:06:21] <+barkon345> just becasue people in a state act like they are in the south dose not mean the state they live in is in the south
[2:06:22] <Flyrant> @GohanEgret alright good to know
[2:06:23] <element_of_loyalty> Confederates lost war and did not write history
[2:06:28] <Hydrapissed> whattt
[2:06:29] <stigna1> Wait, was that guy a necrophilliac?
[2:06:32] <$SGrim> Were their confederate soldiers from Illinois? Yes. Did any part of Illinois function as part of the confederacy? Absolutely not.
[2:06:34] <%EvilWillYT> Howdy from the south shore!
[2:06:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> how disconcerting
[2:06:36] <alcors_wisdom> paige doesnt even sound like she has a drawl to me
[2:06:38] <Hydrapissed> is that guy a grand wizard?
[2:06:38] <Afterman_> lol if you dont think confederates wrote history
[2:06:44] <Spydurman> did he kill the chick he fucked . . .
[2:06:46] <+seaearthandsky> so he murdered so one?
[2:06:48] <Rostichenburg> Follow that sign Pat
[2:06:50] <+seaearthandsky> LUL
[2:06:50] <KaiserRolled> Pat you already have close to 150 again
[2:06:51] <Hydrapissed> 4 off
[2:06:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "What made me a man is now dead"
[2:06:56] <+AntithesisEK> Tennessee zombie, it's a common issue.
[2:06:57] <SatansDick1> 4 off
[2:06:57] <%umbypokochan> sad Pat is sad
[2:07:01] <ragasquid> IM SORRY
[2:07:02] <element_of_loyalty> MUFFINS VS CAKES IS POINTLESS
[2:07:02] <+barkon345> again this is a Canadian trying to tell Americans what is in America
[2:07:02] <$birdfella> They hated her because she was right
[2:07:05] <Kalcom> okay lol
[2:07:06] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Easiest way to explain is southern by location not by location
[2:07:08] <$vinnybushes> there's a sigh for a stag station!
[2:07:09] <guppy_> why is pats character so stinky
[2:07:10] <SatansDick1> its literally argueing semantics
[2:07:12] <%bluetocho13> #2000lostgeos
[2:07:14] <+th3madness> jump pat
[2:07:14] <AtlasMcCoy> oh pat
[2:07:14] <jinkipng> SNOWBIRD COSPLAYS AS A SHOUTHERNER
[2:07:14] <Brainworm205> BECAUSE ITS NOT IN THE SOUTH. I LOVE YOU ANYWAY
[2:07:14] <%Press_X_ToJASON> @ragasquid you didn't make them ignorant
[2:07:15] <+MisterMusashi> he doesn't see th epath right there sbfpSetIn
[2:07:16] <alcors_wisdom> northerners are assholes about southerners
[2:07:16] <Flyrant> nobody wants to be part of the south
[2:07:16] <stigna1> Oh no. He does not know.
[2:07:16] <%Ferakin> Also people in the north desperately don't want to be associated with the south
[2:07:17] <ValidVenasaur> pat blind?
[2:07:17] <$Mendin> Oh it's Big Thing
[2:07:18] <%rdark_ksu> culture not location damnit!
[2:07:19] <danzig2> just keep running in circles pat
[2:07:20] <Spydurman> US regions make zero sense cause half of it is based off a war 150 years ago that makes zero sense today
[2:07:22] <%Remery_> Doesn't matter America as a whole is a piece of garbage
[2:07:23] <Hydrapissed> if it aint a coast its south
[2:07:24] <tUxUt> we dont want you to be tainted by the southern germs paige FeelsBadMan
[2:07:26] <%Press_X_ToJASON> GET THE AIR HORN
[2:07:26] <Them00n> Different regions in America may aswell be different countries in some cases.
[2:07:26] <%BioApple> "southern not by location" just means rural
[2:07:28] <TW2SElite> Pat go up
[2:07:29] <element_of_loyalty> eat a dick pat
[2:07:33] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Paige quit trolling the precum babies.
[2:07:36] <soraabora> Pat its cause we all hate each other and need to seperate
[2:07:37] <KekFrog> It's basically people being over concerned with regional classifications quite often based on modern ideas of historical stereotypes and such.
[2:07:37] <%JackalKing> Every time I see a confederate flag in California I think "Do you even know where you are right now?"
[2:07:39] <+TheUberknife> the grey corner
[2:07:39] <Mr_Strut> There's a north, south, west, east, and a center.
[2:07:43] <%Ferakin> There are no good corners to the US though
[2:07:44] <+mobius_won> No one does
[2:07:45] <AtlasMcCoy> Oh god my heart, these jumps
[2:07:47] <%commanderclaw> California is the asshole then
[2:07:48] <thelaxinator> The midwest is actually on the eastern half of the states right?
[2:07:48] <Kalcom> floridamen
[2:07:49] <%Ferakin> They all suck in different ways
[2:07:51] <%Press_X_ToJASON> @CrystalLakeWasJusASetback imagine thinking it;'s trolling and not ignorance
[2:07:52] <SatansDick1> go pay the trol toll
[2:07:53] <Brainworm205> BECAUSE Alabamians like me do not want to be lumped in with corn-ass Illinois
[2:07:55] <Mr_Strut> The yeti people
[2:07:56] <%Solidnick18> idk
[2:07:58] <%Agami23> those arnt people pat
[2:07:58] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean if we refer to it like that then Canada becomes America's hat
[2:07:58] <corepool> HA
[2:07:59] <SchroedingersFerret> To be fair, we don't have many things to be proud of.
[2:08:00] <donny_pandairaz> Florida is the Gun of the US
[2:08:00] <KekFrog> Some people live up North, but they talk funny
[2:08:01] <AtlasMcCoy> PAT PLEASE
[2:08:01] <Flyrant> west coast is best coast
[2:08:02] <stigna1> Gaaaaaa
[2:08:03] <danzig2> pat i swear

[2:08:04] <Hydrapissed> oh man hes gana die
[2:08:04] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:08:06] <+buttdirt> florida is the bathsalts corner
[2:08:09] <+OranHexthief> it's too big cause we have corners AND the mid-west which is further separated into three parts
[2:08:09] <%commanderclaw> Don't like 90% of canadians live within 200 miles of the US border?
[2:08:10] <+Saggitori> @angriestpat without the midwest we wouldn't have midwest emo music like americam football
[2:08:11] <Shooterboy23> why is that song so familiar
[2:08:12] <goronhead> Is this obvious shortcut helpful?
[2:08:14] <$GohanEgret> CORN IS GREAT
[2:08:14] <%Agami23> and remember paige, LA is the boot
[2:08:15] <%EvilWillYT> Isn't California the most Canada-Like state?
[2:08:16] <SatansDick1> go pay the toll pat
[2:08:16] <+Ciphris> pat being racist to my fellow inuit
[2:08:16] <hypoid77> corn ass
[2:08:16] <element_of_loyalty> AGREE ALABAMA
[2:08:17] <%Remery_> Hahah
[2:08:21] <TalisKanju> Florida: America's Butt
[2:08:24] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat ask the Canadian government. They don't consider the first-nationals people rooKek ... oh wait FeelsBadMan
[2:08:24] <%Ferakin> Alabama is literally hell
[2:08:25] <+mobius_won> Chicago o hare is the worst tho
[2:08:26] <$vinnybushes> @Shooterboy23 it's the first track off a 2mello album
[2:08:27] <%Press_X_ToJASON> @EvilWillYT yes
[2:08:27] <+th3madness> oh no
[2:08:28] <AtlasMcCoy> Yea but to be fair, who wants to be associated with alabama?
[2:08:30] <%Remery_> Chicago is like Detroit's drunk cousin
[2:08:31] <Flyrant> Alabama is the worst
[2:08:31] <+mobius_won> It’s fine
[2:08:31] <ragasquid> I agree
[2:08:32] <soraabora> LMAO
[2:08:33] <element_of_loyalty> FUCK YOU PAT
[2:08:33] <%Solidnick18> i guess
[2:08:33] <$Mendin> Pat go open that lift
[2:08:35] <xiccy> night
[2:08:36] <Hydrapissed> we need like two
[2:08:36] <stigna1> America has WAAAAYYY too many states.
[2:08:37] <AncelDeLambert> Healing is far too slow in this game
[2:08:39] <+Fenlig> Give some up for the robots
[2:08:39] <$OmegaWeltall> we have 50
[2:08:40] <SweetCheeksTrap> Just nuke half of them
[2:08:40] <TheMilhouseExperience> To be fair no one wants to be lumped in with you FIBs.
[2:08:41] <%BioApple> I'm pretty sure "flyover state" was a term deliberately invented to refer to illinois
[2:08:41] <%commanderclaw> We don't have enough
[2:08:41] <Mr_Strut> We have exactly as many states as we need.
[2:08:42] <+megaotter> I'm from Georgia. We have Atlanta I guess
[2:08:43] <+barkon345> its like how people in up satate new york get pissed when people say that every part of new york that is not the city is up state
[2:08:43] <dekkitout> we dont have enough ststes
[2:08:45] <Borealum_EX> is pat getting worse as he gets further into the game?
[2:08:48] <SatansDick1> albama sucks
[2:08:51] <TalisKanju> California is nothing like Canada. First of all, California isn't a frozen wasteland.
[2:08:53] <Kirijuo> We also have territories that aren't even states
[2:08:53] <%MrMcCrabby> @AngriestPat we have extra states in case the androids demand we give them one
[2:08:56] <Brainworm205> If you live in Birmingham, it’s fine. If you live anywhere else in Alabama, it sucks.
[2:08:56] <%PipIV> you could drive 12 hours and then some in Texas and still be in the great state of the lone star
[2:08:57] <ancrest_tant> I say we need 50 more
[2:08:57] <%D_day> Alabama is only good for the "Alabama Slamma" joke
[2:08:57] <+mobius_won> It’s humid as fuck
[2:08:58] <+FadingEmber> 13 is unlucky Pat
[2:08:58] <%Agami23> the republicans are trying to give us more states by splitting california into 3 more smaller californias.
[2:08:59] <%bluetocho13> you can drive 24 hours and still be in texas
[2:09:00] <Happy_Karl> Pat most of Canada is woods.
[2:09:00] <stigna1> @Borealum_EX Yeah, he was...NAILING iIT earlier. :D
[2:09:01] <GreatSmasherPunch> Illinois is poverty Minnesota
[2:09:02] <MCCrackaZac> @Borealum_EX he's getting tired probably
[2:09:07] <$vinnybushes> you didn't activate the stag station
[2:09:07] <KangarooCyborg> We bought extra states because of the OCD. Needed that round number.
[2:09:07] <element_of_loyalty> Pat does not mature with age
[2:09:08] <+jjjkopf> Germany has like 16 states
[2:09:08] <corepool> it really isn't that much don't sweat
[2:09:09] <Hydrapissed> 1200 geo DOWN
[2:09:09] <$SGrim> Is she actually having McDonalds more than once a day? rooWut
[2:09:10] <+th3madness> 1200 geo is nothing you baby
[2:09:13] <frozenottsel> what's the difference between 13 and 10+3
[2:09:20] <Flyrant> California is great, there's just too many people
[2:09:22] <+mobius_won> I pray every night my ac doesn’t ever die
[2:09:22] <SwindlerOfProgress> Paige is right. It's not even that much Geo.
[2:09:22] <%bluetocho13> #1200
[2:09:24] <AncelDeLambert> Well, how many states are in the European Union? HaHA, checkmate, Canuckistan!
[2:09:25] <AtlasMcCoy> LUL
[2:09:25] <%Remery_> Hahahah
[2:09:27] <$GohanEgret> that answers that
[2:09:27] <Prism_Wing> @taliskanju Nope, it's a burning wasteland Kappa
[2:09:28] <%Solidnick18> i guess
[2:09:28] <KilljoyHexx> Tilt knight begins now
[2:09:28] <Borealum_EX> oh well then it's understandable
[2:09:29] <%Ferakin> One's a bad game and the other's a game that doesn't exist
[2:09:31] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat just grind off screen
[2:09:31] <+Sam_Tzu> Alabama = college football + "other things?"
[2:09:32] <+Roundelay11> The addiction is real
[2:09:33] <alcors_wisdom> oof i can only stomach fast food like once a week
[2:09:33] <Borealum_EX> have a nice game
[2:09:37] <Gorgen> How tf is she not fat?
[2:09:40] <element_of_loyalty> CHEESE
[2:09:41] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Should Paige go to the shame car?
[2:09:41] <ryu1299> wait until the actual hard shit
[2:09:43] <+Shaggnar> Confirmed rooNom
[2:09:44] <Them00n> McDonalds intervention when?
[2:09:44] <MrTurtleThief> It's not even a joke now LUL
[2:09:45] <rhus> MADONAL
[2:09:46] <element_of_loyalty> WORMS
[2:09:46] <$GohanEgret> mcdoanlds all the time? she MUST be from the south Kappa
[2:09:46] <pede2011> Who the fuck get McDonalds more than once a month? Shit is nasty
[2:09:48] <AtlasMcCoy> What did paige do to deserve the mcdonalds now?
[2:09:49] <%JackalKing> Pat, the entire population of Canada is less than the population of California alone. You have 13 states because most of Canada is empty and there is no reason to break it up further
[2:09:50] <+Ilpala271> it's all the lupus
[2:09:51] <%PipIV> the lupus burns all the excess
[2:09:51] <KekFrog> It's not just Republicans that want to split California, some Democrats, third-party supporters, and independent want it too. Honestly though, most people just don't care, from what I can tell.
[2:09:54] <%Remery_> Mc'Donalds eating, Illnois livin, Trash Panda
[2:09:55] <SatansDick1> california has some cool places, but way too many people. im from cali btw
[2:09:55] <TalisKanju> 3 Californias, AKA two Californias shit on Los Angeles
[2:09:56] <element_of_loyalty> GLASSES

[2:10:12] <TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 I meant in like, what made me a man in the stereotypical ''sex conquest'' aspect, and the ''actual functional human person'' aspect. Both who gave me that are dead. That's what I meant. And yes, Pat, you're right, we do have too many. We should consolidate some of them.

[2:11:01] <KekFrog> Fat is not just about calories in and calories out, if you just run a deficit of calories, your body will most likely eat its own muscle instead of fat.
[2:11:02] <TheMilhouseExperience> The grease is going straight to her eyes. Explaining the blindness.

[2:18:41] <AtlasMcCoy> Man, that would have been 2000 right now if he didnt lose 1200 geo
[2:18:47] <AncelDeLambert> it's an extreme delicacy because people have died eating it
[2:18:48] <shinesparker198> and that's one of the reasons why the french are a joke

[2:40:49] <%Fenrirlives> check Pat's Orgasms for worms planted by McDonald's
[2:40:52] <clonexsniperx> isn't it more of the idea that to check his sperm count he has to jerk it in a docotr office
[2:41:09] <%Remery_> No I want to watch you chew Pat :(
[2:41:09] <TalisKanju> What did Pat order?

[2:50:22] <Crankthulhu> @Anonymasque Don't tell people how I live - Pat
[2:50:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Anonymasque What's worse, is that since he knows he's being watched, he'll wind up looking even more awkward trying to play cool
[2:50:51] <KangarooCyborg> #2 burgers
[2:51:09] <whoami777> pats locked in bug hell now, but at least he saw cornifer and bought the map. Joseph Anderson did the same thing but missed the map, too.
[2:51:23] <Flurbleman44> Just got here, whats up guys!
[2:51:31] <Crankthulhu> I like on the podcast Pat complained about having to grind better Amps in Warframe, but the missions that force you to use them, you can't fail
[2:51:39] <KaiserRolled> lionDemon3 lionDemon4
[2:51:42] <randomp141> Pat and Paige are festing, Elmo's still the supreme ruler of the stream
[2:51:46] <Crankthulhu> You die and just respawn
[2:51:47] <+MetaSla> Anyone know this song title? Sounds like it's P5, but I haven't played P5.
[2:51:55] <sparrrow_> Pat's existence has always been a bug hell
[2:52:04] <+TeethMuncher> I just hope he finds the pass and doesn't have to backtrack
[2:52:10] <SweetCheeksTrap> Oh man Pat's so fucked now
[2:52:13] <+thesw1tch> @sparrrow_ nah he didn't get that job

[2:52:34] <+MetaSla> @TalisKanju thanks m8
[2:52:42] <%theblackgoddess> @MetaSla it is from p5
[2:52:50] <SweetCheeksTrap> Does this mean he misses the "friend" encounters you get to see throughout deepnest?
[2:52:52] <element_of_loyalty> oney <3
[2:53:04] <Eresus> I hate deepnest, it's the worst... and I love it
[2:53:13] <Wauughlord> Has Pat said anything about the Warframe "Frame Fighter" update?
[2:53:16] <$Retrocop87> just joined, has Pat defeated Jiren yet?
[2:53:19] <Solidus_113> woke by bugs
[2:53:20] <panchetekills> speaking of warframe, you think maiming strike will become useless in melee 3.0? cus I farmed like 4 of those badboys last week and want to sell them
[2:53:21] <stigna1> @Eresus I love how mean it is. Like, it deliberately tries to heck you up.
[2:53:26] <SweetCheeksTrap> Pat's stuck in Deepnest
[2:53:32] <%Jpdodds> Just got here, did I miss hard progress?
[2:53:39] <+Justin_Wood> Yo Solidus
[2:53:41] <stigna1> @panchetekills Nah. They already nerfed the spin-to-win build and memeing strike lived.
[2:53:49] <Flyrant> who did this "be right back" screen?
[2:53:56] <%Jpdodds> Voltabass
[2:54:03] <randomp141> I get the feeling Pat's gonna get destroyed by evil butt bugs.
[2:54:06] <KangarooCyborg> "The Food and Drug Administration allows up to 19 maggots and 74 mites in every 3.5-ounce can of mushrooms before they act on behalf of our food’s safety. If you’ve ever eaten canned mushrooms, it’s likely you’ve also ingested a maggot (or two) by accident."
[2:54:26] <ChineseNininga> that’s the game
[2:54:31] <KaiserRolled> People who eat mushrooms are subhuman anyway so it's fine
[2:54:42] <element_of_loyalty> Pat gets hic ups
[2:54:44] <ChineseNininga> hollow knight is all about being destroyed by evil butt bugs
[2:54:53] <$Retrocop87> mushrooms grow from insects anyways, so it's fine
[2:55:03] <HatingSince87> So streamlabs made me log in before I could donate, is that new?
[2:55:03] <KekFrog> >there's something wrong with eating maggots
[2:55:03] <+Sam_Tzu> mites are teeny tiny. maggot oaf thats rough
[2:55:12] <randomp141> Ya, but the way people describe the are I suspect it's gonna get worse.
[2:55:15] <%GarbageNirvana> It's been doing that to me too
[2:55:36] <%zangetsu_114> Drops my mushroom flavored Doritos. What do you mean subhuman?!
[2:55:40] <TalisKanju> You eat less bugs in mushrooms than you would have if you ate broccoli
[2:55:43] <+owl_jack> song name?
[2:55:43] <SweetCheeksTrap> Does anyone know if Pat is now missing out on the creepy little bug encounters you see in deepnest?
[2:55:55] <King___Crimson> deepnest isn't even the worst zone
[2:55:55] <HatingSince87> I really wanted them to read my donation around the time of the surprise loads cause now it'll seem even weirder than it already is
[2:56:02] <Deku_Scribe> Try washing your vegetables maybe?
[2:56:07] <zafooru> @owl_jack this is behind the mask from p5 i think
[2:56:08] <KekFrog> This is like how your kitchen counter has more dirt and crap on it than your toilet set, clearly this is fine.
[2:56:17] <+owl_jack> thanks
[2:56:19] <%flagi64> As someone who lost a ball to cancer @angriestpat , you should get yours checked.
[2:56:35] <KangarooCyborg> "Americans on average most likely ingest 1 to 2 pounds of flies, maggots, and mites each year without knowing it — a level the FDA says is safe."
[2:56:42] <zafooru> beneath the mask, rather
[2:56:47] <whoami777> seeetcheeks im not sure but it seems droppjng through the back enterence moves cornifer so its possible
[2:56:52] <HatingSince87> Pat is one of those weirdos who fears getting sick but fears finding out whats wrong with him even more
[2:57:13] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Is that a mustard IV?
[2:57:22] <+DeaconBluesClues> @HatingSince87 so, a coward?
[2:57:23] <%zangetsu_114> Let your fears consume you.
[2:57:35] <Gorgen> Why does Peepee have a box cutter
[2:57:36] <%Cadwae> Yes, she needs it @Roasted_Pheasant
[2:57:54] <randomp141> Eh, just say Pat has leprosy of the brain.
[2:58:08] <+Justin_Wood> So where did Pat go? Bathroom? Just wondering if there's an ETA on his return

[3:40:59] <missmariefanart> the mantis lords are rad
[3:41:00] <AtlasMcCoy> Time to get bodied a second time
[3:41:00] <Sol_Install> that burp was just LUL
[3:41:00] <AncelDeLambert> wait until the final level when you go in yourself, Pat, you get to call it Meatboy then
[3:41:01] <%Ssaik> I feel like 'Losing slowly' sums up the entirety of this game's atmosphere, same with Souls
[3:41:01] <+AntithesisEK> sounded like paige
[3:41:04] <asbestosflavored> do we know if woolie did whilte palace?
[3:41:04] <%maskedriderhero> Is Paige melting?
[3:41:05] <damienlunas> I really want to see Pat do Path of Pain
[3:41:10] <Sol_Install> it was like paige
[3:41:12] <SecksOffender> get away from these eating noises
[3:41:16] <Sol_Install> Paige is working btw
[3:41:22] <%BioApple> Liquid Paige
[3:41:24] <stigna1> @Ssaik Someone last stream said "this is basically DS2, plot-wise" and it really blew me away.
[3:41:27] <pede2011> She is dying with style
[3:41:31] <$Tredecian> "illl timestop the world and melt with you'
[3:41:39] <+king_of_beggars> What about that Shadow Realm on the first map?
[3:41:41] <malfion> Who is the disembodied head there behind Paige
[3:41:45] <AncelDeLambert> the game is literally DS2 with bugs
[3:41:47] <AtlasMcCoy> CAPITALISM HO
[3:41:51] <%Ssaik> @stigna1 oh wow that's super right wow
[3:41:58] <damienlunas> Actual Mini-buys
[3:42:00] <SatansDick1> wait now you have some time stops you can go to some of your blue markers
[3:42:02] <$vinnybushes> @AngriestPat originally there were no custom map markers period
[3:42:02] <%BioApple> @AncelDeLambert but DS2 already had bugs :^)
[3:42:02] <KaiserRolled> So many people cried and bitched about that when the game came out and dropped the game as a result i'm sure
[3:42:04] <AtlasMcCoy> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[3:42:07] <Prevot> you want free markers? what are you, a dirty commie?
[3:42:09] <+AntithesisEK> except not incoherent trash heap narrative wise
[3:42:15] <corepool> probably want to sit at closer bench
[3:42:21] <KaiserRolled> PogChamp
[3:42:23] <+AntithesisEK> hollow knight succeeds
[3:42:24] <missmariefanart> no freebies
[3:42:29] <cerberuscarmine> mantis village! :D
[3:42:35] <AncelDeLambert> @kaiserrolled nah, you have to get to the end to get the lore that this is literally DS2
[3:42:38] <ssmotzer> Back in the Forgotten Crossroads
[3:42:40] <KaiserRolled> I got a deep nest for ya pat *points to butt*
[3:42:40] <%Divryne> That's in Greenway.
[3:42:44] <NerevaRising> Map management is one of the best aspects of this game imo
[3:42:45] <leole11> it was in forgotten crossroads
[3:42:48] <pede2011> @AngriestPat You marked it
[3:42:52] <VentusHero> honestly thought that picture in the back was paige
[3:42:55] <+TeethMuncher> Too dark to jump
[3:42:55] <Thesasquatch95> How’s the stream going I just got home from work.
[3:42:58] <missmariefanart> he's marked a lot of things
[3:42:58] <cerberuscarmine> LOL
[3:43:06] <AtlasMcCoy> Man those fucking dlc map markers would have been super great to have when I played this game
[3:43:09] <malfion> In a sense we are all Paige
[3:43:09] <SatansDick1> greenpath has a dark place
[3:43:11] <Prevot> to defeat the mantis boss you need to plug the controller into the other port
[3:43:11] <Tisaric> Every mechanic, including the mapping, feels so fleshed out
[3:43:16] <stigna1> @Thesasquatch95 Pretty good! Lost some geo, got salty, beat mushroom land and got stuck in deepnest.
[3:43:16] <AncelDeLambert> @thesasquatch95 Pat fell into Blight Town and couldn't get out for an hour
[3:43:19] <+TeethMuncher> @Thesasquatch95 progress made, progress lost
[3:43:24] <%BioApple> so how much you want to bet he falls straight back into deepnest after the mantees

[3:54:04] <energywarning> try the spite charm if you have it
[3:54:06] <%maskedriderhero> Pat is a Stage Beetle, shouldn't he fucking trounce these string beans?
[3:54:07] <KaiserRolled> Once you find the attacks where you can get off a heal it's not as bad
[3:54:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Good try Pat
[3:54:13] <+TastySammiches> but just win tho
[3:54:15] <%drabberfaun535> cheer400 Been watching your and liams playthrough of prey back to back. the different dynamics are interesting to see. would e fun to see woolies perspective too.

[3:54:29] <stigna1> @drabberfaun535 God, I love Prey so much.
[3:54:32] <SatansDick1> theyre literally the abyss watchers
[3:54:37] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> LEFT
[3:54:40] <stigna1> Yo, she did Ebriatas E.Z.
[3:54:43] <AtlasMcCoy> Dont worry pat, it took me like, 6-7 tries
[3:54:44] <%Agami23> paige only helps those who help themselves

[3:55:46] <reonome> harpischrod, yes pat
[3:55:52] <SnaKemuho> there's a boss literally called Watcher Knight, so this one isn't really Abyss Watchers
[3:55:54] <AtlasMcCoy> I bet the mantis lords are actually super cool with you comin here

[3:56:17] <shinesparker198> I wanna see pat completing the arena
[3:56:29] <+Worldbrand> i mean to be fair it is important to heal before phase 2 because you get much less breathing room
[3:56:31] <SwindlerOfProgress> He's learning. PogChamp
[3:56:32] <+Dimfish> the arena will drain his soul
[3:56:35] <Prevot> @shinesparker198 don't ask for the impossible

[4:16:40] <brosephmike> Temple of the Black Egg is a vacation spot
[4:16:40] <+TeethMuncher> @StridentSong he can't explore the mines yet

[4:17:09] <SecksOffender> the temple is more of an Easter egg than actual content

[4:25:49] <%skizzuto> nope
[4:25:54] <devanmuse> holy shit he's still going... is Paige still awake? She looks dead
[4:26:01] <missmariefanart> no subways in a mine
[4:26:01] <brosephmike> All roads lead to laser bugs
[4:26:05] <cerberuscarmine> she ded
[4:26:05] <$Varlinator> Is this game anything like Ori and the Blind Forest?
[4:26:06] <LixFury> there is no stagstation in bah sing say
[4:26:06] <$Mendin> Pat stop getting owned
[4:26:08] <%Divryne> No stag for you.
[4:26:11] <SirSmudgey> stags are inconveniently rare
[4:26:11] <Rostichenburg> No stagways here
[4:26:11] <cerberuscarmine> rest in donalds
[4:26:13] <Kirijuo> theres a stag right outside tho
[4:26:23] <+Dimfish> hes about to lose his 600 geo isnt he

[4:26:27] <%HobeBryant> Paige sliding further and further inside the couch
[4:26:36] <missmariefanart> they eat the mcdonalds worms
[4:26:39] <+gantz_zero> i think the mine is too new for a stagway to be around? @AngriestPat
[4:26:40] <MyNameIsRasus> can pat deflect projectiles?
[4:26:43] <stigna1> Pat, your souls!
[4:26:46] <custoadian> Stag stations being few & far apart is probably my only real gripe with this game
[4:26:58] <missmariefanart> only some projectiles
[4:27:02] <%Spydurman> Paige's shirt matches the couch and makes it look like she's meshed together with it
[4:27:06] <ValidVenasaur> your shade tho
[4:27:07] <stigna1> @MyNameIsRasus Yee; hitting projectiles with the nail deflects them. Hitting melee attacks with the nail parries them.
[4:27:09] <agustorm123> Pat go for your geos
[4:27:13] <SatansDick1> paige has gained enough insight to become the couch
[4:27:14] <missmariefanart> paige the couch homunculous
