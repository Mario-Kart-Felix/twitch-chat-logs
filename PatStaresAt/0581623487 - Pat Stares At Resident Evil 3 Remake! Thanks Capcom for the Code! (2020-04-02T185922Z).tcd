[0:20:18] <+Creggamonsta> I'm really torn with getting RE3 when I know i'm goin to drop it when FF7 comes out
[0:20:21] <%cvp5127> neets rise up

[0:20:23] <%amilie3> amilie3 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 3 month streak! re3 hype lets go

[0:20:25] <EuropanLamprey> I have actually noticed no change in my life
[0:20:27] <%Faustgesicht> Has pat played RE3re besides the demo?
[0:20:33] <LeetRunt> Hi all
[0:20:38] <+CoPowah> bruh PSN is fast. takes 30 minutes for me to reinstall FFXV with all the DLC and the standalone Multiplayer
[0:20:43] <worldbrand> oh that fucking sucks
[0:20:44] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Pigg1yJuffs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! How you doing, Pat? I'll be honest, kinda jealous that you're playing some RE3 right now, seeing as I didn't have the money for a pre-order and there weren't any physical copies in stock. (I'm weird about downloads after losing some emails in the past.)
[0:20:48] <+Valask> @collind99 fuck them
[0:20:50] <%Dragon_Batman> I don't think he has touched RE3 other than maybe a test
[0:20:52] <+REDtheBEAST> @Man_in_the_Red i know hes played the OG RE3 walrusCant
[0:20:57] <%Dragon_Batman> beside the demo I mean

[0:21:00] <GUNxSPECTRE> Just a friendly reminder that money is made up
[0:21:04] <%RadicalPirate> @collind99 I would check your contract and see if they can legally even do that. Research, know your rights, for real
[0:21:09] <%ItsAbout9000> All I have to say is screw Randy Pitchford.

[0:22:35] <the_sprankton> how did that not just spread all over the world?
[0:22:37] <+XGSaber> Virus is extremely dangerous. So ill carry it in a glass vial in my pocket. Ooops
[0:22:39] <Perky_EDF> @Nobody404 The virus makes the infected comatose. They buried them in shallow graves quickly to get rid of the bodies thinking they were dead.
[0:22:41] <%spiritofmojave> discord your buddies I've been doing it for a year, same applies to face to face peeps :b
[0:22:42] <%MonsterEnvy> Also 10% of people are immune to the T Virus aka the survivors in the game.
[0:22:43] <DexteraXIII> Turns out that was kind of hard to write around.
