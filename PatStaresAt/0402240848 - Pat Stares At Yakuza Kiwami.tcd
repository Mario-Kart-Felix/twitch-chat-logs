[0:20:23] <%lewdskeletor13> This is makes a lot of things make sense
[0:20:24] <%ElenaManetta> I had a teacher with a lazy eye in high school and on my first day going there he asked me a question but I didn't realize he was talking to me and then said "WHAT, OH ME? YOU WEREN'T LOOKING AT ME"

[0:24:28] <%SrG00SE> your eyes dont just get worse as you get older, its rare but some people (myself) have had their eyes improve over time
[0:24:31] <RealThiele> reverse sharingan, forget all seen moves
[0:24:31] <%starotter70> Arguable
[0:24:34] <grayjammer> ITS PURPLE
[0:24:34] <%Teintstein> bet it'd be frustrating to be red color blind and also be a red-head
[0:24:34] <Thalchampz> i can't make fun of your blindness, my eyes are so fucked that i need lenses
[0:24:36] <%MagickBurritoh> the blurple

[0:24:52] <devanmuse> the "perfect calibration" of your television?
[0:24:53] <%ElenaManetta> I used to lie during eye exams by trying to look at the sheets before hand and memorizing the letters
[0:24:53] <+punch_ghost> I'm legally blind with what the doctor called 20/500
[0:24:54] <%kiiiirsten> It explains every best friends youtube comment that was just "BLIND"
[0:24:55] <JZPotter> 20/20 Vision club over here
[0:24:56] <%Keaton_x> My eyes don't dilate properly so I'm almost completely blind in direct sunlight and darkness. It's real fun driving home on country roads at night.
[0:24:57] <%lewdskeletor13> It explains your LP blindness
[0:24:59] <pectusumbra> yeah, my eyes are super bad
[0:25:00] <theangryguyofde> nearsighted? Pat can't even see the ground LUL
[0:25:02] <%starotter70> Yeah, that was nuts
[0:25:03] <Mnightshyamallama> 20/10 is better than normal, 10/20 is 20/40
[0:25:04] <%BisoromiBear> These were early symptoms of your Stand awakening
[0:25:06] <%MagickBurritoh> I see those
[0:25:07] <$valriot> I HAVE THAT
[0:25:07] <%TheGreatBamBe> @AngriestPat I have kreaconus or whatever the fuck it is spelled, the lens on my eyes are warped and that means light FUCKS me up. I can't drive without getting blinded by light. My vision is killing me slowly

[0:25:19] <%ScreamingMeat> That was a weird anime, what with the titty milk and all that
[0:25:20] <%shiplord13> shiplord13 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from hawk_rush! 
[0:25:21] <%kknutson4> kknutson4 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Pat now that you beat Sekiro you should give Nioh another shot. I've played both and Nioh is definitely the easier one.
[0:25:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh no Pat
[0:25:25] <Psyramics> that's also what a streaky windshield looks like, so make sure there isn't one of those in the way

[0:25:34] <%BigNerdSam> Pat, just get some robot cyber eyes.
[0:25:35] <%shotgang86> Man I had 8 degrees myopia, had a cirurgy, best money spent on my life
[0:25:37] <%salty_syd913> yeah that just happens right?
[0:25:38] <Shortnamer> a lot of people have slight astygmatism iirc
[0:25:38] <%Bloop3l> Asti is how curvy your eyeball be
[0:25:39] <%mastertwin2> mastertwin2 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Pat, been playing DMC5 and just discovered the beauty of Royal Guard, the perfect parry sound is stuck in my head. Thanks for introducing me to this sick niche Japanese bullshit! Rock on you crazy ginger
[0:25:40] <Bouldus> yea
[0:25:45] <%MagickBurritoh> that seems wrong
[0:25:45] <%HuskyGreene> Hey chat! Hey Pat
[0:25:48] <%ElenaManetta> So what you're saying is you're the perfect candidate for the GOOGLE GLASS
[0:25:50] <Bouldus> whats happening?
[0:25:52] <Mr_Strut> Yo Pat, why your eyes so shit?
[0:25:53] <+aivalera> I may have that, but that may just be my glasses too.
[0:25:53] <%shotgang86> its an investment, HUGE one, but it is super worth it
[0:25:57] <%Metaljohn117> J.J. Abrams directing your life
[0:25:57] <%lewdskeletor13> @huskygreene Howdy apatDab
[0:25:57] <%GohanEgret> what do you mean everyone looks like monsters and I'm currently in silent hill?
[0:25:59] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat the fucky thing for my
[0:26:00] <$Gehtingsberg> Pat you just squint to much my guy
[0:26:04] <thelonechris> Get 2 robot eyes
[0:26:08] <narusao> one of them cowboy bebop eyes that see the past
[0:26:09] <%Laecerelius> Make sure you have orks believe that it can shoot lasers
[0:26:09] <%SrG00SE> i feel like we should have the tech for better robot eyes already
[0:26:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Doesn’t your mom have an aura too
[0:26:16] <Bouldus> like a smart person
[0:26:17] <%kiiiirsten> Lasik scares me
[0:26:18] <aimlesshealer> That makes sense
[0:26:18] <NotHereToStream> oh boy the restaurant scene upcoming
[0:26:19] <+Ell1ot> they do that while you're awake
[0:26:20] <$valriot> @angriestpat Get a Sharingan
[0:26:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Or was that Paige’s mom
[0:26:24] <%ElenaManetta> I'm terrified of laser eye surgery because of an Adult Swim show
[0:26:24] <+masked_hero_lucky> My astigmatism is under control for the most part, but I can do this thing with my eyes where I can make them rapidly jerk back and forth.
[0:26:25] <RealThiele> uncle did both and he was useless for days as well
[0:26:25] <%BigNerdSam> No Pat, chrome up both of your eyes. Chrome your eyes off with cyborgism.
[0:26:26] <%lewdskeletor13> I don’t remember
[0:26:26] <%mitchteck> I only get that when i squint
[0:26:27] <%klutch02> Lasik is SUPER WORTH IT, do both at once
[0:26:28] <foreverN2dust> Just got here, Pat isn't going blind is he? NotLikeThis
[0:26:31] <%nitronLVIII> i heard that starburst patterns are unique to you based on the shape of your eyes
[0:26:31] <%kiiiirsten> AcHOO
[0:26:34] <SilverFaustX> lol
[0:26:35] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat the fucky thing for me is one of my eyes is much better long distance while the other one is better up close
[0:26:37] <%snow_bush> @AngriestPat I got Lasic It's not that bad, although your eyes will itch like hell for a day or so
[0:26:38] <+DarkSunGvvyndolin> one eye at a time makes it sound like you have more than two
[0:26:39] <MarylandJutsu> Pat become BIG BLIND
[0:26:39] <%daveronald> go to 2 doctors and compair
[0:26:39] <%Metaljohn117> get the robo eye, start the cyborg process
[0:26:42] <%gespenst25> you think they'd sneeze and hit both?
[0:26:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten it's nothing, just a doctor SHOOTING LAZERS lNTO YOUR EYE
[0:26:43] <+PenmanLupine> you know they don't hang over you while lasering your retinas
[0:26:45] <shadowkitsune1236> pretty sure a computer is "lasering" your retinas
[0:26:46] <+PenmanLupine> They're in another room
[0:26:48] <%Laecerelius> laser eye surgery isn't even permanent. your eyes can go back to being fucked afterwards after a few years
[0:26:50] <%ElenaManetta> I'm terrified of all correction and cosmetic surgery
[0:26:50] <$Gehtingsberg> Only half blind
[0:26:51] <%SrG00SE> ive never heard of someone getting lasik and regretting it just saying
[0:26:52] <%klutch02> Ive had it for both eyes, its life changing my dude
[0:26:53] <@StridentSong> LASIK is done by a machine, not by hand
[0:26:53] <Bouldus> not as blind as Paige though Kappa
[0:26:53] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars WutFace
[0:26:54] <foreverN2dust> Thank god
[0:26:55] <%starotter70> If that happens, at least Paige could take care of you... sipsipSipsipblind
[0:26:56] <%connos_livereview> everyone is going blind
[0:26:57] <ToneBacas> what, the doctor is gonna sneeze twice, once for each eye in the same procedure?
[0:26:58] <%kiiiirsten> Excuses
[0:27:00] <porterhau15> I did Lasik it is awesome. it's pretty much all machines now
[0:27:05] <%lewdskeletor13> We already knew you were blind
[0:27:06] <$valriot> Surrreeeee
[0:27:10] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[0:27:13] <MarylandJutsu> But is ELMO blind?
[0:27:14] <marvel877> Or the player's inability to think to look up...
[0:27:17] <%shotgang86> it depends more on you actually, You have to stay really still so it doesn't burn your corneas in the wrong places
[0:27:18] <devanmuse> I remember covering stuff like that in science class. The Gorilla video, right?
[0:27:19] <%GohanEgret> sounds like johns to me Kappa
[0:27:22] <%rdark_ksu> !uptime
[0:27:23] <%SrG00SE> tunnel vision
[0:27:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 27m 24s.
[0:27:23] <$cureneckbeard> What if he spits in your hair
[0:27:29] <$PulverKong> it's the same thing as people not seeing a huge gorilla running past while staring at a magician doing a thing
[0:27:30] <%starotter70> Skellmo has the best vision in the house
[0:27:33] <wolvenelf> Johnsblindness
[0:27:33] <foreverN2dust> Is it like the thing with the ape playing basketball?
[0:27:35] <%shotgang86> and the "It explains so much" was a joke man
[0:27:36] <%ElenaManetta> That happens when people watch me draw
[0:27:39] <aimlesshealer> I think it's amazing you can play a game and read chat at the same time
[0:27:39] <MarylandJutsu> Woolie and Paige BIG BLIND

[0:28:04] <%lewdskeletor13> What if Paige spits in your hair?
[0:28:06] <porterhau15> would you get a cyborg eye?
[0:28:07] <Bouldus> Pat has hair, its on his face
[0:28:11] <%ElenaManetta> Do you dread the day you have to get glasses
[0:28:13] <Mr_Strut> How would you know?
[0:28:13] <%bread_assassin> It's like that video where you're asked to count the # of times a basketball is being passed around, and then asks if you saw the dancing gorillla in the video.
[0:28:18] <+DarkSunGvvyndolin> well he'd have t spit in your beard
[0:28:20] <%rdark_ksu> yea lets talk about brain shit!

[0:28:22] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat but what if the barber lasers your eye?
[0:28:24] <%BigNerdSam> What if the eye laser doctor etches a butt into your eyeball, so everything you see is butts?
[0:28:27] <%nobunagaesq> what if he sneezes in your eye
[0:28:28] <%connos_livereview> what if the eye laser doctor checks your prostate but his hands are on your shoulders

[0:28:37] <%Bloop3l> Bloop3l subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Weird fact that I use to break the ice on dates, Apparently stardew valley broke the geneva conventions at one point, wierd
[0:28:40] <C_S_N_G> Like a CPU
[0:28:41] <%brickwall35> that's 100% false
[0:28:42] <Nekros4442> Our brains are basically really shitt single-core processors
[0:28:42] <Bouldus> you can actualyl multitask, it jsut doesnt give you a good result
[0:28:43] <%Hiro01231> are you trying to keep him away from doctors?
[0:28:43] <flyingavocadosofdoom> You're awake for eye surgery
[0:28:44] <$PulverKong> your brain don't work on many things at once, but it can multiplex if you work on it
[0:28:46] <%daveronald> no one can actualy chew gum and walk at the same time
[0:28:50] <%SaltyDongs> gear second
[0:28:50] <%ElenaManetta> He's talking AND drinking, folks
[0:28:53] <+roach__> Drummers do it.
[0:28:54] <+lewisleicester> ONLY ON THE BULL!
[0:28:54] <%lewdskeletor13> So multitasking
[0:28:58] <%GohanEgret> dabbing? apatDab
[0:28:59] <+SimplesRock> in computer science, that's called "context switching". Most OS's manage many threads in this way
[0:29:09] <%ElenaManetta> It's easy as an adult
[0:29:12] <$valriot> That a lie, i can watch porn and jack it
[0:29:13] <%ElenaManetta> Rub belly
[0:29:14] <%ElenaManetta> Pat head
[0:29:15] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yes
[0:29:16] <%HyperCharge_Sam> pat and rub your belly in circles
[0:29:16] <%SrG00SE> its the direction change
[0:29:18] <%MagickBurritoh> Do it fast
[0:29:18] <arkv01> some forms of multitasking rely on muscle memory
[0:29:21] <%shotgang86> Hey CHAT, do THAT that Pat did, seriously
[0:29:21] <ToneBacas> that, but then rub faster
[0:29:22] <%lewdskeletor13> Shake your own bag
[0:29:24] <aimlesshealer> What?!
[0:29:27] <%shotgang86> you would be surprised
[0:29:29] <%king_wragles> cause of brain devolpment
[0:29:31] <%SrG00SE> you have to do it consistently then try to change directions
[0:29:31] <%ElenaManetta> It's hard as a kid and when you're drunk
[0:29:34] <%salty_syd913> you gotta get a rhythm to it
[0:29:38] <%salty_syd913> it makes it easier
[0:29:39] <$valriot> Then why can you do it????
[0:29:41] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat pretty much
[0:29:41] <%brickwall35> @SrG00SE still super easy
[0:29:42] <logoth_> ! BABY BROKE !
[0:29:43] <Xelhesia> that makes sense kids are stupid
[0:29:50] <%BigNerdSam> Babies need time to calibrate
[0:29:51] <%SrG00SE> @brickwall35 well fuck me then
[0:29:52] <%lewdskeletor13> Kids are dumb as fuck
[0:29:52] <%Harawanagangsta> LUL babybork

[0:30:07] <+Ell1ot> i have a VHS tape of my brother getting eye surgery. he was awake for it and the numbing started to wear off when they got to his oither eye
[0:30:09] <yellowpandamilo> That’s a shitty skill to get through level up
[0:30:11] <JetpackMcQuack> If you practice anything enough you can do it via muscle memory in the background
[0:30:11] <MarylandJutsu> Put those BRAINS BACK IN THE OVEN
[0:30:12] <%ElenaManetta> You actually look MORE sleepy
[0:30:12] <%Teintstein> if you want to break your brain a little bit check out the stroop effect
[0:30:12] <Shortnamer> yeah kids are pretty dumb
[0:30:14] <Bouldus> kids are less intelligent then the average dog until theyre like 4
[0:30:14] <$Gehtingsberg> Watch as the entire chat pats their head and rub their belly

[0:37:08] <+miguelrod777> DONT LITTER TOO
[0:37:08] <%king_wragles> That's.... that's actually a pretty nice thought
[0:37:08] <%brickwall35> but not pay, just dine and dash. and litter.
[0:37:08] <+Caped_Eggy> Isn't that more expensive?
[0:37:10] <%shotgang86> big tips and big sips
[0:37:11] <r_Foeburden87> i always tip unless service was extreemly negative

[0:37:17] <Nekros4442> But Pat, what if you live in a country where wait staff are actually payed a livable wage?
[0:37:19] <$cureneckbeard> But if I don't tip, I could give Pat the money and he will read out my shitpost

[0:40:32] <Prevot> not tipping makes you an asshole, unlike littering LUL
[0:40:36] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat in america its already required to tip at restaurants tho
[0:40:37] <%lewdskeletor13> You can totally blame the customer
[0:40:40] <$PulverKong> in my county waiters get ACTUAL SALARIES no need for tips here
[0:40:43] <%El_Desperad0> no
[0:40:46] <%cvp5127> ??

[0:41:01] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 yeah man, I'm not seeing the 1. As a retail worker, or any kind of work, I HATE tips. Or money gifts. ESPECIALLY from family
[0:41:01] <%nicoleymcquack> My tips last summer paid for my much needed laptop for school, without those tips I'd be fucked so, tip servers ppl
[0:41:03] <%gespenst25> how often do you have 100 when you see your mail man
[0:41:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can also just give your mailman a gift at Christmas time.
[0:41:05] <foreverN2dust> WutFace
[0:41:06] <Bouldus> nothing
[0:41:06] <Dao_Puppy> Mailmen find this offensive, they don't want more to carry.
[0:41:06] <$cureneckbeard> It's like a money sale
[0:41:06] <%owl_jack> 20 bucks max
[0:41:06] <r_Foeburden87> That could get them in trouble unfotunatly

[0:41:08] <%kiiiirsten> Fuck you and your maple syrup money!
[0:41:08] <%tweedler92> MONOPOLY MONEY
[0:41:10] <Seitine> The argument that the employer should pay you doesn't work though when the employer isn't going to start paying them just cause you didn't tip them.
[0:41:10] <+SimplesRock> is a toony less than a loony?
[0:41:10] <%SrG00SE> i give them bottles of liquor
[0:41:11] <Bouldus> you dont give anything to the mailman
[0:41:12] <aimlesshealer> How many people do I gotta bribe?!
[0:41:14] <%alexandrecau> give him a tock
[0:41:14] <ToneBacas> @PulverKong like every other developed country should work. except USA for some weird stupid reason

[0:41:17] <Bouldus> theyre the mailman
[0:41:17] <GoldeNOVA> Give him a package Kappa
[0:41:19] <+frontlinecaster> I don't ever interact with a mailman because I live in an apartment
[0:41:19] <Ion_Laser> tip people in coins? WutFace
[0:41:20] <%primax104> give him your love

[0:41:22] <+starkandstag> tip your aniki
[0:41:22] <%lewdskeletor13> I got a 5 once for helping someone out to their car at the store

[0:41:24] <%nitronLVIII> YOU Canadians and your fake money

[0:41:27] <%SaltyDongs> Give him a kiss
[0:41:31] <%Fadedblank247> i give my mailman my bills
[0:41:32] <%gus_hornblende> @AngriestPat i read your mail chat in twitter, I dont know if I can take your mailman advice
[0:41:33] <%MagickBurritoh> Monopoly money
[0:41:34] <+SuzakuRising> just don't tip your waiter the way Kiryu tips his waiter.

[0:41:38] <+Ell1ot> Fuck my mail man. He never drops off my packages and always leaves those, "sorry we miissed you" slips
[0:41:40] <Bouldus> why do people not get paid for their jobs?
[0:41:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Canadian money sounds so dumb. "Hey, I have a toonie! I'm gonna go to timmies and buy a Double Double!" We're such a broken country.
[0:41:44] <+WorldsBestPanda> When I was a cashier, helping a customer to their car was a welcome break from cashiering. No tip necessary.
[0:41:44] <Dapper_Cactuar> looks like the Warframe anniversary event started
[0:41:45] <InugamiTheHound> why can't America switch to a $1&$2 dollar coins
[0:41:49] <Fujiwara_92> Kiwami means Graphic Card
[0:41:51] <Bouldus> fuck tipping pay your employees
[0:41:52] <$TheCrispyBoi> i don't thin that's a thing in the u.s
[0:41:53] <$PulverKong> @ToneBacas yep every american seems to think tipping is "the shit", whereas in other countries you get an actual monthly wage and don't need tips to survive
[0:41:54] <%MagickBurritoh> Give your waiters YOUR tip
[0:41:55] <%Keaton_x> Every time I hear about Loonies and Toonies, I believe less and less that Canada isn't some made-up fantasyland.
[0:41:56] <KishinGrek> loony tunes, milk in bags, CANADA
[0:42:00] <joneworldbeater> You should probably tip your barber so they don't spit in your hair
[0:42:02] <+aslfrasle> A looney is a $1 coin and a twooney is a $2 coin. They're called that because the $1 coin has a loon on it.
[0:42:03] <CrimsonCore90> evoShill woolieYE
[0:42:05] <%nicoleymcquack> Y'all don't understand how literally a dollar can make a huge difference
[0:42:06] <reonome> @InugamiTheHound we do have $1 coins
[0:42:06] <%ECRead> I often was tipped for putting Christmas trees on people's cars. not as often as I'd like.

[0:42:22] <%SaltyDongs> did he say crackages
[0:42:23] <%SrG00SE> during the summer if you live somewhere hot, keep a case of water near the door and give a bottle to your delivery man
[0:42:24] <r_Foeburden87> SPEAKINg of packages you got Video card incoming
[0:42:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PulverKong We don't think tipping is great, it's a horrible system. But if you don't tip the wait staff they starve to death. So tip your waiter.
[0:42:26] <+aivalera> Wow, that’s super cool of you Pat
[0:42:28] <foreverN2dust> UPS is still better than USPS

[0:44:00] <%primax104> it's the big Zinc and BRASS corporations man
[0:44:00] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Nickle is also almost completely useless
[0:44:00] <+aivalera> I’m one
[0:44:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> IF we get rid of pennies, how will I tip my waiter @AngriestPat
[0:44:03] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the penny is trash currency only useful for whipping at people you don't like
[0:44:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> LIKE 500 POUNDS
[0:44:07] <%Agami23> last teusday to get fate/extella link
[0:44:07] <%camodikk> its also stupid the penny costs more then a penny to create
[0:44:08] <%vincerocmm> throw em at the homeless and bits
[0:44:08] <%nobunagaesq> it cost more to make then its worth
[0:44:09] <Yrefe> You're talking to people that use a MADE UP measurement system!
[0:44:09] <%AllYouCanYeet> I genuinely throw pennies in the trash
[0:44:10] <%supersugoisenpai1> Those penny press things at museums and zoos
[0:44:10] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[0:44:11] <%nicoleymcquack> I literally THROW my pennies away
[0:44:11] <%primax104> Big Zinc and Brass
[0:44:11] <JetpackMcQuack> Aren’t pennies for tips? Kappa
[0:44:11] <%kiiiirsten> Been there
[0:44:12] <%DeathsEvilTwin> is the audio out of sync?
[0:44:12] <+Ell1ot> i give beggars pennies
[0:44:13] <%starotter70> Don't we lose more money making the penny?
[0:44:13] <nerdblase> You've never had the joy of rolling pennies into 50c rolls.
[0:44:15] <%alexandrecau> @jujushermano got rid of them like 5 years ago
[0:44:15] <%Edgy_Macaroon> I've used nickels and dimes before
[0:44:17] <%galaxyswirl> PENNIES ARE AWESOME
[0:44:17] <%BigNerdSam> Pennies are useful. you can put a hundred of them in a sock and smack a motherfuckers eye out of their socket for under a dollar.
[0:44:19] <%rdark_ksu> I have a bottle that can hold over 200$ in pennies
[0:44:20] <r_Foeburden87> take the coin mnonney to comicon i do
[0:44:20] <%nitronLVIII> PENNIES literally cost more to make than they are worth
[0:44:22] <+aivalera> We have, more or less.
[0:44:23] <%SrG00SE> and youre always shocked with how low the payout is
[0:44:26] <%galaxyswirl> I WILL FIGHT FOR PENNIES
[0:44:26] <$cureneckbeard> How strong do you have to be to carry a 18 litre full of copper
[0:44:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> And it only ends up being like seven dollars
[0:44:29] <%supersugoisenpai1> We should also switch to metric
[0:44:30] <mochile69> PENNIES ARE DEMOCRACY
[0:44:31] <%gus_hornblende> Hey, how DO you access the discord?
[0:44:32] <Omnislash195> How would you tip the mailman without pennies? lol
[0:44:32] <%HyperCharge_Sam> you can melt them down and sell them for more then their worth
[0:44:34] <+Smegmaester> Pennies are garbage but you will never defeat the AMERICAN SPIRIT
[0:44:34] <Xelhesia> same here. penny must be removed from our simulated reality. just like the sun
[0:44:34] <+aivalera> We just use credit cards
[0:44:35] <+RobotPancake> but its worth whatever you wish for when you toss it in a fountain...thats a bargain
[0:44:36] <%MagickBurritoh> I got 3 dollar-coins today
[0:44:37] <jujuschlempermo> @alexandrecau makes sense
[0:44:38] <+Ghostbody> but 50 cent rolls are fun to punch with.
[0:44:40] <reonome> @BigNerdSam thats more than a dollar if you count the sock
[0:44:40] <+silverback129> I got $50 from pennies
[0:44:41] <foreverN2dust> Take it to the bank instead, they don't take out as much as the coin machines.
[0:44:42] <$PulverKong> US folks, if you actually PAY the waiters a normal wage noone needs to tip them. Like here in Norway.
[0:44:43] <%King_Sear> I once saved like $60 dollars in change over like 3 years
[0:44:50] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat your never suppouse to get that many its literally used for the small purchases like 6.78 and such
[0:44:58] <%lazylynch> niohs great
[0:45:00] <%chaumiester> We should be like the Japanese, and melt our pennies to use as jackets.... for OUR FREEDOM BULLETS!!!
[0:45:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> NIOH IS GOOD
[0:45:06] <Bouldus> has it ever been?
[0:45:07] <CSeriesJTYPE> the gamefeel
[0:45:08] <$PulverKong> In Japan you don't tip also. They consider it an insult
[0:45:09] <$Ascethetic> its the mission system
[0:45:10] <%SaltyDongs> I heard that pronunciation you weeb
[0:45:10] <%Rngiddion> View Nioh as a Loot game
[0:45:13] <Prevot> goblins
[0:45:14] <%King_Sear> the amount that it was compared to the amount of coinage was so underwhelming
[0:45:14] <+aivalera> Thatms why you use pickle jar
[0:45:14] <InugamiTheHound> I wish in America we could get rid of penny and replace $1&$2 dollar bills with dollar coins
[0:45:15] <$TheCrispyBoi> play bloodlines, you fuck
[0:45:17] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat My mom used to have one of those giant water jugs for Office water fountains full of pennies
[0:45:17] <%galaxyswirl> just ignore the gear
[0:45:18] <%Metaljohn117> @angriestpat You only use pennies when someone's a huge dick to you and you have to pay them for a service or product
[0:45:20] <Bouldus> yea niohs a loot game
[0:45:21] <foreverN2dust> Nioh's loot is way too much
[0:45:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> Yeah, I hate the loot part of Nioh
[0:45:24] <%connos_livereview> the only thing pennies are good for is loading int buckshot to fire at the bourgeosie
[0:45:24] <reiju_22> just wait for nioh 2
[0:45:25] <+aivalera> Pickle jars can only weigh like twenty pounds
[0:45:27] <Bouldus> thats a good descriptor
[0:45:28] <$shurtal> @angriestpat fun fact, the e penny costs like 1.7 cents to make or some shit
[0:45:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> IT JUST iSNIN'T DARK SOULS
[0:45:31] <BlacSoul> FUCK that inv system
[0:45:31] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @AngriestPat penny production is heavily lobbied by the zinc industry i believe
[0:45:34] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 pennys are great. Lincoln freed the slaves, a sock of pennys makes a great weapon, and there is no sweeter pleasure than buying a $20 item with all pennys and making the poor suck count them out. Especially if you know the guy behind the counter
[0:45:39] <+StrawberryPantsu> Nioh is ez
[0:45:41] <+NickyDynamite> You just gotta look at big numbers and lock what you like, then delete the rest
[0:45:43] <$valriot> Nioh is fuckin Diablo
[0:45:44] <Shortnamer> @AngriestPat can we get an Omikron stream with Paige? Kappa
[0:45:44] <Deano8817> you can do it pat
[0:45:44] <MarylandJutsu> oh dear
[0:45:45] <%RabbiKing> How do you have a problem with that game's inventory management when its a looter like the many other looters you play
[0:45:45] <PowerfulBlackGangs> ...
[0:45:45] <Kirby_Sauce> No numer 1
[0:45:46] <rad_dude123465> Nioh is fucking awesome, I do wish the loot was dialed back a bit
[0:45:46] <%nameless_majin> cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 here are some bits I wont be giving to my waiter. and theres nothing you can do about it
[0:45:49] <Mr_Strut> You broke Pat

[0:46:06] <Bouldus> did they do something to the jews?
[0:46:07] <the_youngster21> It was because they weren't allowed to use the Red Cross symbol
[0:46:07] <+Ghostbody> eh?
[0:46:07] <Ner234> I'm sorry what?
[0:46:07] <Jontman42> You can't just not explain that
[0:46:11] <%Tucker0603> wut the fuck that mean?
[0:46:11] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, the Diablo loot in Nioh was bleh.

[0:46:13] <+ItBeNyx> yeah

[0:47:13] <Xelhesia> @AngriestPat they gotta adjust first tho
[0:47:20] <%Laecerelius> As someone who decided to coward out as a DPS in 14, we ARE the worst
[0:47:20] <Psyramics> Healers are forged in the fires of Dumbass Mountain, where they pull DPS from the depths of stupidity
[0:47:23] <%SaltyDongs> Sad boivin

[0:47:31] <%primax104> Drag on Drag oon?

[0:47:48] <r_Foeburden87> ISgardians specificaly
[0:47:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Playing with exclusively randos in Warframe really forces you to make sure you're as godlike as possible so you don't have to rely on them
[0:47:56] <Calek> I play Healer in FF14 because I don't want to rely on anyone else, and I trust myself to do a good jbo

[0:48:59] <%starotter70> Oh boy
[0:49:00] <+코코꾸라> oh no
[0:49:00] <%El_Desperad0> Kind of true
[0:49:01] <aimlesshealer> The flames are rising
[0:49:01] <rad_dude123465> Game time?
[0:49:01] <%Teintstein> here it comes
[0:49:01] <+Mrkel90> Hey pat how you doing?
[0:49:02] <%galaxyswirl> @aslfrasle really?
[0:49:02] <%Teintstein> oh shit
[0:49:03] <+frontlinecaster> Fuck off if you don't tip they won't magically pay waiters more
[0:49:04] <+TridentBerryBurst> good pops
[0:49:04] <+aslfrasle> @vaporousTippler Apparently.
[0:49:04] <$TheCrispyBoi> fuck you, pay them
[0:49:07] <reonome> TIP YOUR SERVERS
[0:49:07] <%SrG00SE> apatBig apatHoldon
[0:49:08] <%connos_livereview> tbf the goverment really aught to pay workers a living wage
[0:49:10] <StromkoPenguin> You not tipping isn't going to make them pay a living wage.
[0:49:11] <+frontlinecaster> You're not fixing anything by fucking over servers
[0:49:11] <Bouldus> no fuck you pay your staff, not my problem
[0:49:13] <Necrobern> cmonBruh
[0:49:18] <Xelhesia> yup
[0:49:19] <%Teintstein> time for a patsplain
[0:49:27] <+frontlinecaster> Literally fuck off and eat shit if you don't tip in the states or elsewhere where it's normal.
[0:49:29] <reonome> don't punish the fucking servers for a manager's decision
[0:49:33] <%Laecerelius> You not tipping isn't going to make the restaurant less dirtbag
[0:49:33] <%cvp5127> guilt is a powerful motivator
[0:49:34] <%shiplord13> It helps people
[0:49:40] <$PulverKong> The problem is that in US they never STOPPED doing that...in other countries they pay waiters actual wages
[0:49:42] <Basch71> its true
[0:49:42] <indig0bird> I just finished ARR and post-ARR. Hell, post-ARR is so much better than the rest
[0:49:44] <Bouldus> dont guilt the customers fuck you
[0:49:44] <%NovraSplice> NovraSplice subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Fuck you it's March-uary?
[0:49:46] <%nicoleymcquack> Y'ALL servers don't get paid enough and some managers keep tips fron their servers, like they NEED it?????
[0:49:46] <Twoiis> Nah. They love tips.
[0:49:46] <%nmaten> its true
[0:49:47] <%connos_livereview> true
[0:49:47] <%SrG00SE> is it ideal? no. is it the world we live in? yeah
[0:49:47] <JetpackMcQuack> BUT!
[0:49:48] <aeonicvector> Your right, but also wrong
[0:49:49] <+frontlinecaster> No one wants tipping as a system. But not tipping is just starving a fucking worker instead of the boss
[0:49:50] <Seitine> And it's not like anyone will fucking listen to people who want to change it and pay the people a living wage. You're not fighting shit.
[0:49:53] <+butch_deadlift> if you dont tip youre just an asshole
[0:49:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you don't tip the server, you're not fixing it.
[0:49:53] <Twoiis> Because they end up making more than an hourly wage.
[0:49:55] <%El_Desperad0> Only tip your delivery drivers
[0:49:57] <+frontlinecaster> Literally just fucking kill yourself if you're not tipping
[0:49:58] <%rdark_ksu> oh god not rent
[0:49:58] <Bouldus> fucking pay your staff
[0:49:58] <Dovakhin573> you are hurting the people man
[0:50:00] <%SaltyDongs> just like the story woolie told
[0:50:01] <Bouldus> noit my problem
[0:50:02] <%nameless_majin> LUL
[0:50:02] <%shiplord13> By not tipping you are screwing someone over not the system
[0:50:02] <StromkoPenguin> Would you not tip the street urchin that shined your shoes? Yes society should be looking after them but it won't.
[0:50:03] <%ElenaManetta> I don't think it's about sticking it to the man, it's not not shaming a customer if he DOESN'T tip
[0:50:05] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Fight the power
[0:50:05] <Mr_Strut> Tell the waiter to get a better job
[0:50:06] <+Mrkel90> !uptie
[0:50:09] <+Mrkel90> !uptime
[0:50:09] <%lewdskeletor13> ALL YOURE DOING IS HURTING THE SERVER YOU ASSHOLES grrr
[0:50:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 50m 11s.
[0:50:09] <+greatgetter> Good thing this doesn't apply in the UK
[0:50:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> PiZZA DELIVERY DUDES MAKE $5.85 AN HOUR WHILE IN THEIR CAR
[0:50:13] <$TheCrispyBoi> you speak the tru tru
[0:50:13] <Yrefe> ok but what would Marx do?
[0:50:20] <+frontlinecaster> @ElenaManetta Shame on you if you don't tip
[0:50:21] <Archmortal> @Bouldus fight the system then, jackass
[0:50:23] <DracaenaLeaf> Japan doesn't tip iirc
[0:50:23] <%chaumiester> Know a guy who makes 90K through tips... works at a very high class joint though. And yes, he knows Tipping is BS, but he doesn't complain too much for obvious reason
[0:50:24] <%JustToWatch> if you don't tip you're a fucking psychopath
[0:50:24] <%terribleusername> just be a good or hot server. no problem
[0:50:24] <%king_wragles> Ya, just don't go to the restaurant
[0:50:24] <%nicoleymcquack> Like I said, my tips were the ONLY way I could afford a laptop for school, id be fucked without it
[0:50:24] <Bouldus> no were going defy america, because america dumb
[0:50:25] <indig0bird> Basically that, you're not fixing shit by not tipping
[0:50:25] <$SGrim> Technically, the lack of salary and union options are hurting them, but whatever rooShrug
[0:50:26] <reiju_22> PogChamp
[0:50:26] <dekkitout> Chill out there, Jotaro Kujo
[0:50:26] <%SaltyDongs> Just like Woolies story oh my god
[0:50:27] <TheBlankAce> What a hero
[0:50:28] <Necrobern> I WAS THERE
[0:50:28] <foreverN2dust> I clapped
[0:50:31] <$PulverKong> @lewdskeletor13 not if the server gets a normal wage as they do in other developed countries except for USA
[0:50:33] <%Exyoh> If everybody goes 'not my problem,' people in the service industry are fucked
[0:50:33] <%Fruitywhompus> if you pay with a card and dont tip youre actually taking money away via taxes
[0:50:34] <Bouldus> @Archmortal pay your staff jackarse
[0:50:35] <flame_of_udun_> 👏
[0:50:37] <%NovraSplice> yeah we don't have that problem in the UK cos we still get paid minimum wage
[0:50:38] <reonome> @Bouldus how brave of you
[0:50:38] <Xelhesia> @AngriestPat where i am a waiter only gets paid $4.50 an hour. i always tip 10 bucks cuz i've been there and it sucks
[0:50:39] <TheNewJapanGuy> You sound like Amazing Atheist right now for some reason
[0:50:41] <Littlecjmajor> @AngriestPat it was used as bribe until WWII cause they had to make "cut backs" in certain areas but it was really for people to pay the servers less
[0:50:41] <%nameless_majin> apatBig PogChamp
[0:50:42] <+sham_> @bouldus don't fucking eat out then you twat LUL
[0:50:42] <jobbedbone> No you're not because the US system is fucked, the place is REQUIRED to make up the difference to minimum wage
[0:50:45] <Absurd_Lizard> PogChamp //
[0:50:46] <Bouldus> PA YOUR STAFF
[0:50:46] <grouchio> I hope Pat talks more about anime on the podcasts. Especially stuff like Slime Isekai and Kaguya-Sama.
[0:50:46] <%HyperCharge_Sam> That's why everyone needs to support a 15$ min wage
[0:50:47] <%lewdskeletor13> @pulverkong Yeah but they dontv
[0:50:49] <%NovraSplice> so a bonus tip is like "Oh neat, a nice bonus for my actual service"
[0:50:49] <skeith77> PogChamp
[0:50:49] <%starotter70> I clapped when I saw it
[0:50:50] <Bouldus> how is that hard
[0:50:51] <$cureneckbeard> the war economy
[0:50:55] <Bouldus> it works for the rest of the world
[0:50:55] <%brickwall35> @AngriestPat Do the opposite, leave a tip but don't pay the bill
[0:50:57] <%connos_livereview> realistically the only solution is to overthrow the rich
[0:50:57] <+HelveticaScenario> People who don't tip when the server makes less than minimum are scum.
[0:50:58] <Mr_Strut> I just don't eat out
[0:50:58] <%SaltyDongs> This is amazing
[0:50:58] <NotHereToStream> may aswell pay the waiters entire salary while we're at it Kappa
[0:51:03] <+frontlinecaster> @Bouldus None of us is making that decision. TIP YOUR FUCKING WAITER
[0:51:11] <JetpackMcQuack> You’re just gonna puss off the people that handle your food
[0:51:12] <ToneBacas> are waiter just slaves then?
[0:51:15] <Omnislash195> Just cook at home and forget that noise
[0:51:17] <%lewdskeletor13> If you don’t tip your waiter you’re scum
[0:51:18] <%connos_livereview> revolution when
[0:51:21] <%Exyoh> If y'all want to not need to tip again, ever, just get the living wage
[0:51:21] <%cvp5127> or just dine and dash
[0:51:23] <%Fruitywhompus> @ToneBacas yes
[0:51:24] <Bouldus> @frontlinecaster i live in a country that pays their customers, pay your staff
[0:51:24] <%Shadowthedigger> And then watch as the companies pass those new costs onto you the consumer and the waiters get fired.
[0:51:27] <%Teintstein> Diet Coke Count: 1
[0:51:27] <Nekros4442> BUT JOTARO DID IT
[0:51:28] <jobbedbone> You think restaurants won't lobby to keep it how it is?
[0:51:29] <reonome> @Bouldus don't eat out and complain to your local politician if you care so much about wait staff
[0:51:30] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat canada have the none minimum wage for waiters too? thought only was am american thing
[0:51:31] <Bouldus> pays their staff*
[0:51:33] <televisedrevolting> NO BE JOTARO THO
[0:51:37] <+frontlinecaster> @Bouldus I don't have staff, because I'm not a fucking owner
[0:51:38] <%galaxyswirl> @Shadowthedigger exactly
[0:51:38] <%starotter70> Fucking Kujo
[0:51:42] <$PulverKong> @frontlinecaster not if the server gets a normal wage as they do in other developed countries except for USA
[0:51:42] <+Ell1ot> how will you get arrested? you ate the proof!
[0:51:43] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I left for 40 minutes and Pat is still yapping LUL
[0:51:44] <Seitine> There should be a sign you put on your table if you're not going to tip so you have to go get your own shit.
[0:51:44] <omen_setter> just don't eat ever
[0:51:46] <Archmortal> @Bouldus Then why are you telling people who don't live in that kind of place not to tip their waiter, fuck you
[0:51:46] <MarylandJutsu> @Nekros4442 jotaro teenage is an asshole
[0:51:48] <grouchio> @Fruitywhompus I hope Pat talks more about anime on the podcasts. Especially stuff like Slime Isekai and Kaguya-Sama. Can you tell him this?
[0:51:50] <+frontlinecaster> But the no tipping thing doesn't punish the owner. It punishes the fucking worker
[0:51:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Luesagna00 It's not. There are a lot of countries that do it.
[0:51:58] <$SGrim> @HyperCharge_Sam 15$ is unsustainable for agrarian communities and would cause mass destabilization of the food market in the US. rooShrug
[0:51:58] <Bouldus> dude its an american problem, pay your staff, stop being shit, every other country does it
[0:52:03] <nerdblase> Raise minimum wage, businesses adopt automation to eliminate jobs to compensate reducing the value of raw labour, eventually all basic labour becomes automated, wealth is either redistributed from machine owners or consolidated to machine owners causing social upheaval.
[0:52:05] <Mr_Strut> Well yeah with that attitude
[0:52:11] <+frontlinecaster> You want to change, work to pass laws. But you still have to tip in the mean time.
[0:52:11] <%JustToWatch> if you repeatedly go to the same restaurant and never tip, you've probably eaten waiter spit
[0:52:12] <%vaporousTippler> What's bullshit are delivery fees that don't get paid to the drivers.
[0:52:19] <%ElenaManetta> Not if the restaurant has a policy that forbids tips, which some do that have minimum wage
[0:52:20] <Prevot> you're kinda being like Japan
[0:52:31] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @AngriestPat random thing, I just got a Flagellant in Darkest Dungeon named Boivin
[0:52:31] <+White_Sasquatch_> do you consider donating on Twitch to be basically tips for streamers?
[0:52:31] <Mr_Strut> That's right
[0:52:33] <%cvp5127> oh well
[0:52:34] <%nicoleymcquack> Also being a server is WAYYY harder than most job roles, I've worked in retail and iffices and waitressibg drained my actual life force, the tips make it all worth while
[0:52:34] <jobbedbone> they aren't getting punished. they still make minimum wage
[0:52:36] <+frontlinecaster> If you object to tipping, don't eat out
[0:52:36] <Absurd_Lizard> "has to" work there? wut?
[0:52:38] <Twoiis> I actually don't know what Canada does. I still pay them 15% but I don't know how they're being paid.
[0:52:40] <Mr_Strut> No. Punish the workers
[0:52:40] <%chaumiester> Or.. actually what Commonly happens when Min Wage gets forcibly raised by law. People get fired instead
[0:52:44] <Seitine> Screaming in a fucking chat on Twitch that "just pay your employees' isn't fucking doing shit. You're just a cuck.
[0:52:46] <reonome> @jobbedbone they don't, thats the point
[0:52:47] <$HentaiSenpai9K> This is why anarchy is good
[0:52:48] <GoldeNOVA> The game was rigged all along!
[0:52:50] <+frontlinecaster> Like fucking don't eat at restaurants with waiters if you don't believe in tipping.
[0:52:51] <%SaltyDongs> Set things on fire
[0:52:51] <%lewdskeletor13> It would be great if we didn’t have to tip BUT THATS NOT THE WAY IT IS
[0:52:52] <$HentaiSenpai9K> LUL
[0:52:52] <C_S_N_G> Punish them by not going there in the first place
[0:52:52] <+frontlinecaster> It's that easy
[0:52:53] <%connos_livereview> piss in the owners BMW
[0:52:53] <TheNewJapanGuy> it is yes
[0:52:56] <%Rngiddion> thats exactly what this is
[0:52:58] <%SrG00SE> @Bouldus your worldview reminds me of mine when i was also 12
[0:52:59] <%AllYouCanYeet> If you want to punish the business, don't eat there
[0:53:01] <%SaltyDongs> Start anarchy
[0:53:02] <President_valentine> don't tip pat
[0:53:04] <%primax104> Just the tips?
[0:53:05] <%terribleusername> stop taking those tips and make minimum wage instead Kappa
[0:53:07] <%shiplord13> True, which is why I subbed
[0:53:08] <jobbedbone> @reonome yes they do, legally its required.
[0:53:09] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat but if we punish the employees enough, then they will quit or die and that will temporarily punish the business. rooThink

[0:53:16] <%Doruben> you are a clown
[0:53:19] <%JustToWatch> if you don't tip you only deserve to eat fast food
[0:53:19] <Bouldus> @SrG00SE my r=world view reflects that of a country that values their employees
[0:53:19] <televisedrevolting> You technically don't get paid anything.

[0:53:43] <%Verd_254> apatSkelmoney
[0:53:43] <+frontlinecaster> Anyone who lives in a country that requires tipping and doesn't needs to fuck off and die. That simple.
[0:53:44] <omen_setter> if you were my waiter i would tip you even if you didn't make me laugh
[0:53:44] <+Ell1ot> i love money gifts
[0:53:46] <grouchio> @AngriestPat talk more about anime on the podcasts. Especially stuff like Slime Isekai and Kaguya-Sama.
[0:53:48] <%SrG00SE> @Bouldus clearly. your worldview is your country view. thanks for clearling that up lol
[0:53:49] <Bouldus> @SrG00SE not guilting the public

[0:53:53] <%starotter70> Let's see where this goes
[0:53:54] <%nicoleymcquack> It's the same as an artist, you pay for the art and tip for the service

[0:54:11] <Kirby_Sauce> @MarylandJutsu because

[0:54:15] <%connos_livereview> *pweep
[0:54:16] <+aivalera> I see tips as a necessary evil to ensure that my waiter does a decent job.
[0:54:18] <Bouldus> @SrG00SE again, its an american problem, and its dumb
[0:54:20] <%Exyoh> Personal pride stopping you from taking a tip to which you're entitled is just THE MAN keeping you down
[0:54:20] <$cureneckbeard> Now you sit on your ass playing video games and people tip you like $500
[0:54:21] <%Shadowthedigger> Yes those tips you totally gave to your supervisor cause that's illegal in canada probably.
[0:54:22] <$Gehtingsberg> Kiryu lives of of involuntary tips for beatdowns
[0:54:23] <%Verd_254> I tipped the cook once for making me a killer burger. Old guy, said it was the first tip he ever got.
[0:54:23] <%ElenaManetta> BUT YOU NeVER KNOW
[0:54:25] <%lewdskeletor13> People who think they’re fighting the system by not tipping are morons

[0:54:33] <jobbedbone> @reonome if you make under minimum wage from your tips, the employer makes up the difference. Thats literally how it works.

[1:09:25] <acesahn> Ok but seriously... why is he a zombie??
[1:09:27] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat WTFFFFFF??? i had no IDEA that majima can actually do supers as an npc O.o
[1:09:28] <$cureneckbeard> first try
[1:09:31] <+TastySammiches> @acesahn I think the story they wrote works well enough, they just should've had his breakdown over being Shimano's pawn towards the middle of the game instead of the end
[1:09:42] <%nicoleymcquack> Majima used resurrect
[1:09:45] <dekkitout> Sure he did Zachary, not in cannon- but sure he did... tajC

[1:10:03] <Shir0yasha> sumo slapping strong af
[1:10:04] <+aivalera> Zombie Majima should shamble away whenever you beat him
[1:10:05] <0rond> @AngriestPat isn't that the move you kept spamming in the zero LP until it started doing 0 damage?
[1:10:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow majima is like brah you're doing too good
[1:10:08] <%Tucker0603> it slaps
[1:10:08] <%lewdskeletor13> WAKE UP PEOPLE! Batman kills people! Kappa
[1:10:08] <acesahn> @TastySammiches He was all slapping hands and broing out with the guy holding his leash at the end! I didnt buy him going crazy for a second!
[1:10:13] <%galaxyswirl> its the best move in the game @AngriestPat
[1:10:17] <+d00msdaydan> i'll slap your shit
[1:10:21] <Prevot> oh this move is good
[1:10:23] <+aivalera> A great ass move
[1:10:24] <PowerfulBlackGangs> What did the five fingers say to the kiwami?
[1:10:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @galaxyswirl Nah, Tiger Drop.
[1:10:26] <%Gogogolem> essence of pimp hand.
[1:10:29] <%RogueCrocodile> @angriestpat essence of David the gnome
[1:10:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Tiger Drop is so good it breaks the game.
[1:10:42] <President_valentine> Tiger drop is super lenient in this game
[1:10:42] <%SaltyDongs> I would have had batman got to jail
[1:10:42] <nobody12349> He skipped over it
[1:10:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol HEAVYY DRINKING MASTERY
[1:10:46] <%galaxyswirl> @Too_Much_Nukie other than that. i used sumo way more tho
[1:10:50] <$ooblagis> It's a really good Heat move. You can basically activate whenever. Damage isn't huge, but being able to just throw out a Heat move for free is super strong.
[1:10:50] <%Teintstein> "Change Blindness"
[1:10:52] <%laserbeaming> Myeeh
[1:10:52] <TuxedoNash> It can be done from a considerable distance and has no real requirement besides heat
[1:10:58] <+aivalera> Essence of give me my money
[1:11:03] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @gogogolem The power of Mega Pimp shined within you
[1:11:06] <Shir0yasha> tiger drop is good too bad i suck at timing
[1:11:07] <aimlesshealer> "Lord, guide my pimp hand and make it STRONG, Lord."
[1:11:21] <0rond> spamming heat moves makes them deal less and less damage though

[1:11:27] <+TastySammiches> @acesahn the tone of that scene is so weird because Sagawa is about to be killed off and they both know it
[1:11:28] <%nicoleymcquack> Are you planning on a long stream tonight? tempted to stay up all night to unfuck my sleeo pattern
[1:11:28] <Ner234> Bite him Elmo
[1:11:34] <%SaltyDongs> Peta
[1:11:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Body counter has awkward timing compared to the other counter moves but it's good. IMO.
[1:11:37] <+Grayhammatter> pat needs to learn the essence of sumo slapping
[1:11:38] <%lewdskeletor13> DONT HURT THE BABY
[1:11:39] <dekkitout> Tables will turn, hoomin
[1:11:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> eat him, elmo
[1:11:41] <Thalchampz> LUL
[1:11:43] <0rond> that's why tiger drop is op, it's not a heat move so it's damage doesn't scale down
[1:11:44] <SephirKath> Sumo Slap him back elmo!
[1:11:46] <$HentaiSenpai9K> God Hand was The Pimp master
[1:11:46] <+aivalera> Now Pat is a Zombie!!!!

[1:11:49] <+TastySammiches> @acesahn but for whatever reason they never make that explicitly clear
[1:11:56] <$Mendin> crazy talk
[1:12:01] <TheNewJapanGuy> Smoke break
[1:12:04] <stabbityrabbit> Listen, Majima just needed a nap.
[1:12:10] <CastellanVon> Doing any heat moves is detrimental in this game because Heat moves scale super hard INCLUDING Kiwami Heat moves. Bosses will literally regen more HP than you deal with a Kiwami Heat Move if they're scaled. Kiwami System in this game is bullshit.
[1:12:11] <InugamiTheHound> in hobo park, smoking some cigs
[1:12:12] <Ner234> Just chillin
[1:12:13] <%Birdigalore> @AngriestPat I wanna play Yakuza, but where's a good starting point for PC? Zero??
[1:12:17] <%shiplord13> Mandatory Smoke break
[1:12:19] <dekkitout> Majima on his union mandated 15
[1:12:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Zero is the best Yakuza

[1:12:31] <$PulverKong> Is this the game where you buy child porn for a kid?
[1:12:35] <TheNewJapanGuy> Zero is the best
[1:12:35] <%Birdigalore> Thanks folks
[1:12:36] <President_valentine> Zero is the best
[1:12:37] <%ElenaManetta> Video Games are weird
[1:12:42] <%shiplord13> Date:.... I am not a father

[1:13:15] <%starotter70> "Kiryu, don't worry, take your time"
[1:13:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Majima is a cool guy who stopped caring about things and gets his dick hard by fighting his frenemy Kiryu
[1:13:16] <dekkitout> Majima is everywhere, that's who he is
[1:13:35] <$PulverKong> @televisedrevolt ah I just vaguely remember it from a SBFP lets play

[1:14:03] <%DK_Rance> @Birdigalore yea zero is literally before all the other games so its a great place then the kiwami games witch are updated remakes of previous yakuza games 1, 2 and so on cant remember how many kiwamis there are
[1:14:03] <TheNewJapanGuy> He does
[1:14:04] <%Typhaeon> Yes, he speaks it very stiltedly
[1:14:05] <%HuskyGreene> mr satan potatohead
[1:14:05] <%starotter70> Is this accent racist or not?
[1:14:09] <%chaumiester> I can pretend to speak Chinese.....
[1:14:11] <%Typhaeon> And with some of the lilt you'd get in Chinese
[1:14:11] <televisedrevolting> @pulverkong It's a great fuckin' let's play.
[1:14:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> His accent is kind of an offensive charicature.
[1:14:24] <+HellCopter> He sounds as bad as me, an american, doing a fake chinese accent
[1:14:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Recently saw Super
[1:14:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Issa rot rike tawkin rikea dis.
[1:14:29] <Iggeh0> i know the words mamoru, tatakai and nakama
[1:14:29] <Prevot> look at this real dude
[1:14:31] <%rdark_ksu> I cant tell shit
[1:14:33] <%nicoleymcquack> I took a couple years of Japanese but accents are difficult for me to detect
[1:14:34] <%Birdigalore> Thanks @DK_Rance
[1:14:35] <%lewdskeletor13> The Japanese love being offensive to the Chinese
[1:14:38] <dekkitout> Is it REALLY?!?
[1:14:40] <SilverFaustX> lol
[1:14:41] <%starotter70> LUL
[1:14:43] <$PulverKong> @AngriestPat it is kind of like americans making funny "black person" accents
[1:14:45] <Shir0yasha> ummm LUL
[1:14:47] <+burritocheetos> theres definitely a "leaning stereotypical chinese" accent
[1:14:47] <+ilasper1> 4Head
[1:14:48] <%HuskyGreene> damn
[1:14:48] <Ion_Laser> cocaine? WHERE?
[1:14:51] <%Typhaeon> They redubbed the Chinese assassin in 0 for the western release
[1:14:52] <logoth_> huuaahahauhuhuahuahuaaaa
[1:14:52] <%AncelDeLambert> THIS IS SO APPROPRIATE!
[1:14:53] <%afronooch> Mada Mada
[1:14:54] <Kirby_Sauce> AND YET they won't hire an authentic American
[1:14:56] <ender344> Yakuza 6 does a way better job at showing Chinese-accented Japanese and Japanese-accented Chinese
[1:14:56] <%brickwall35> No Yakuza member has ever sold drugs, they are a good group of people
[1:15:03] <%DK_Rance> @Birdigalore then of course normal versions of course of whatever game doesnt have a kiwami of course but yea no problem man
[1:15:04] <%supersugoisenpai1> Not even selling drugs, he just had them
[1:15:07] <Ner234> Offensive Caricature? Yeah sure. Drugs? NOOOO
[1:15:12] <+TastySammiches> @Typhaeon they REDESIGNED the chinese assassin for the chinese release
[1:15:20] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Terada is like oh man these are chucklefucks
[1:15:21] <%Typhaeon> Oh yes, his features also
[1:15:24] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Who is worse? The Yakuza or the Bratva?
[1:15:25] <%starotter70> OH YEAH
[1:15:26] <reiju_22> LUL
[1:15:27] <+sham_> LUL
[1:15:28] <%alexandrecau> the chinese in 0 are like that too save Lee
[1:15:29] <+HellCopter> Did it ever strike you as odd that kiryu's most famous enemies are the evil chinese and korean *body snatchers*?
[1:15:36] <Darren716> Wait do drugs EVER come up in Yakuza?
[1:15:36] <%SrG00SE> I always found it really funny/strange as to what accents are okay to mock and which ones aren't. Italian? no problem. German? lols! Chinese? fucking racist.
[1:15:36] <+burritocheetos> does he say yeehaw alot? LUL
[1:15:39] <Kirby_Sauce> >what I JUST SAID
[1:15:40] <TheNewJapanGuy> Yakuza 3 is ... weird
[1:15:42] <Prevot> american accents in japanese media are HILARIOUS
[1:15:44] <CrowbarFacelift> He's the worst
[1:15:48] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Recently saw Eyepatch Wolf video on YAKUZA. It's so good
[1:15:50] <majindusto> But he is an English speaker tho
[1:15:50] <R3c0n31> Dont we have a voice actor that literally voices all american dudes in games?
[1:15:51] <%shiplord13> Hey should the guy with a concussion be driving the car?
[1:15:53] <%lewdskeletor13> Remember in 0 how the Chinese assassin looked like a FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER?
[1:15:55] <%El_Desperad0> Is the worst part of the game coming up or did Pat do it already?
[1:15:59] <aimlesshealer> IMMA MAD SCIENTlST iss so kewwwl
[1:15:59] <%nicoleymcquack> Idk why its so hard for these companies to find native speakers, it makes all the difference
[1:16:01] <DomunDomunDomun> Does he sound like bacchus in 0?
[1:16:02] <silverira> did i miss Kiryu killing someone?
[1:16:04] <ancrest_tant> That American was as American as sushi
[1:16:10] <+코코꾸라> HEY BOY
[1:16:11] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> @darren716 I don't think drugs are ever mentioned in the series
[1:16:14] <Prevot> @lewdskeletor13 yeah, it was awesome
[1:16:15] <PowerfulBlackGangs> OH BOY
[1:16:20] <+Reizie_Etherealm> MAMORU
[1:16:24] <Kirby_Sauce> We speak no americanno
[1:16:25] <+frontlinecaster> So before we get to this place it is very important to remember that Kiryu never kills anyone.
[1:16:30] <+TastySammiches> DON'T RUN AWAY
[1:16:33] <Prevot> wake the fuck up and accept that Kiryu kills people
[1:16:36] <%HuskyGreene> I was just playing Yakuza 6 and I am pretty sure there is an English speaking convenience store working because he's the only character in the game with a non-japanese accent
[1:16:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Kiryu DOES NOT kill people
[1:16:42] <%alexandrecau> To be fair the chinese assassin is litterally called old demon, all the other chinese are pretty standard looking
[1:16:47] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Don't run away from living
[1:16:52] <+Grayhammatter> kiryu has NEVER killed people
[1:16:52] <silverira> except that one guy
[1:16:54] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Nishki probably would have died in prison
[1:16:55] <Forester_Skippy> how would that scene play out 10 years ago when they jsut planted a line of coke tho
[1:16:59] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @frontlinecaster Even when he does he actually doesn't
[1:17:01] <NannerFone> but kiryu is a big honor boy
[1:17:02] <majindusto> "Wesker" is Yakuza 3 is an English Speaking actor tho
[1:17:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If Nishiki went to prison the Toujou Clan would've prospered for decades.
[1:17:11] <DagetStreams> Why she got adult hands/
[1:17:12] <%lewdskeletor13> I think Nishki wouldn’t be so awful
[1:17:12] <+TastySammiches> shit would've been waaay better for everyone except nishiki
[1:17:12] <ancrest_tant> You are my nakama and nothing will change that you fucking dick
[1:17:12] <+miguelrod777> but they said he would get more street cred so he'd probably be fine

[1:17:14] <%DK_Rance> ew elmo dont

[1:18:59] <+Zeromaru2> He was just defending himself
[1:19:00] <+WorldsBestPanda> Nah, that guy was doomed. Kiryu merely used his corpse as a shield. Totally fine.
[1:19:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jesus the highway scene in 0 was like a war crime
[1:19:00] <%starotter70> Kiryu "Technically" never killed anybody

[1:19:26] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Kiryu didn't kill that guy. The bullets did
[1:19:27] <+TastySammiches> there may or may not be another highway scene in this game
[1:19:27] <+VVerewolfJones> I'm Dick Tracy! Take that Pruneface!
[1:19:34] <%PaladinDupre> Dante VS Kiryu when
[1:19:34] <+코코꾸라> Those are riot bullets, Pat!
[1:19:36] <Darren716> He killed legit 100 people directly there
[1:19:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Good thing there's no highway chase in this game.
[1:19:36] <+frontlinecaster> Kiryu shoots a lot of people in the car chases
[1:19:42] <%bread_assassin> Kiryu used rubber bullets.
[1:19:43] <%lewdskeletor13> No shut up tho
[1:19:45] <Graywolf_the_45th> the car chase is in this game too i'm pretty sure
[1:19:45] <McAngrimStein> I'm Prune Tracy! Take that Di-
[1:19:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He's exploding helicopters while they fire RPGs at him
[1:19:50] <%shiplord13> Was that sword blue?
[1:19:53] <+aivalera> @angriestpat Don’t forget he killed the helicopter and the people inside it!!
[1:19:55] <MusaboriMan2> wielding a scimitar, eh?
[1:19:57] <%HuskyGreene> Kiryu mellows. He kills 'less' as the games go on
[1:19:58] <+BSplitz> has he killed the guy yet?
[1:20:00] <MusaboriMan2> sure not killing anyone
[1:20:03] <%lewdskeletor13> he did
[1:20:04] <InugamiTheHound> chinese dao
[1:20:06] <%supersugoisenpai1> For a Japanese man who doesn't murder, Kiryu sure is good with a handgun
[1:20:07] <Darren716> BSplitz Just missed it
[1:20:07] <%starotter70> Yup
[1:20:08] <rainwater739> @AngriestPat Any plans on streaming more RE2 with Woolie?
[1:20:10] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Also don't forget his knife fatality
[1:20:11] <%Exyoh> That man got crushed so hard by a table, with a sword under his back, that he vanished. But he DIDN'T DIE
[1:20:13] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The C-virus J'avo??
[1:20:15] <Forester_Skippy> thats not a katana in this japanese game set in japan
[1:20:15] <+BSplitz> awh fuck
[1:20:17] <HeroPietro> Pretty sure there were car gun sequences in every single game
[1:20:18] <+SuzakuRising> the rocket launcher to the helicopter in Yakuza 6 though... theres no way he didn't kill that pilot
[1:20:21] <Mr_Strut> They didn't get enough CP.
[1:20:30] <+aivalera> THAT MUSIC THOO
[1:20:30] <%alexandrecau> martial trainign of getting your hand behind your back as you kick
[1:20:32] <+frontlinecaster> Probably shouldn't have spent so much money on these sword proof tables
[1:20:33] <JetpackMcQuack> That greeter was a coke dealer in his free time
[1:20:37] <%shiplord13> Why are the swords blue in the cut scenes
[1:20:38] <%connos_livereview> @lewdskeletor13 pastaThat DoritosChip StinkyCheese back now heres spaget w tortillas and melted cheese
[1:20:39] <+TastySammiches> it's not a scimitar it's a dadao
[1:20:44] <rainwater739> WHOOOO! I love that series!
[1:20:44] <TheNewJapanGuy> Is the DMC 5 LP finished recording?
[1:20:45] <+Ryham_Assassin> SourPls
[1:20:46] <%MagickBurritoh> a date between Pat and Woolie?
[1:20:48] <PowerfulBlackGangs> They probably just watched a couple wuxia movies and called it training
[1:20:53] <%connos_livereview> did i miss anythin chat
[1:20:55] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, he's gonna be super rusty
[1:20:56] <%starotter70> @TheNewJapanGuy I think so, yes
[1:20:56] <%lewdskeletor13> @connos_livereview Many thanks <3
[1:20:58] <InugamiTheHound> I said it was a dao
[1:21:01] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Rusty makes it more fun
[1:21:03] <aimlesshealer> I can't wait for that shit
[1:21:03] <silverira> a "little"
[1:21:04] <TheNewJapanGuy> Good!
[1:21:05] <$TheCrispyBoi> a date with woole hmmm
[1:21:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> How much of a mess did Woolie make when he learned about Sin Devil Trigger?
[1:21:09] <Ner234> Neat
[1:21:13] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat alot of studies have been done that show people who take martial arts all their life get their shit pushed in by street thugs.
[1:21:17] <simulationbard> It's been a hot minute
[1:21:17] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Bloody Palace LP/Stream?
[1:21:18] <MusaboriMan2> this music is pretty cool
[1:21:20] <%SrG00SE> @supersugoisenpai1 you can go look for yourself ep 29 i think
[1:21:23] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @supersugoisenpai1 That video is already out
[1:21:24] <Shir0yasha> a whole episode in the void. sick!
[1:21:26] <Ner234> @supersugoisenpai1 Rumor has it they are still cleaning up
[1:21:31] <%lewdskeletor13> The last two episode last have been Woolie making orgasm noises
[1:21:38] <aimlesshealer> The Woolie Hole will never be the same
[1:21:38] <$PulverKong> @Gogogolem because martial artists only spar with people using the same rules as they do.
[1:21:41] <+TastySammiches> USE GUN
[1:21:47] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @supersugoisenpai1 He literally told Pat to leave so he could wank LUL
[1:21:49] <%nicoleymcquack> I just switched on my laptop and it pinged SO LOUD at 1am :/
[1:21:50] <+silverback129> "What does the hat do on trickster?"
[1:21:52] <%Gogogolem> @PulverKong Exactly
[1:21:55] <$PulverKong> @Gogogolem what you kicked my balls? that's not ALLOWED
[1:22:10] <+frontlinecaster> Or a table
[1:22:14] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Or a bowling ball
[1:22:15] <devanmuse> there's no such thing as a fair fight in the real world
[1:22:16] <%SaltyDongs> Pick up a rock
[1:22:18] <+cosinity> But what if they pick up a syringe
[1:22:18] <GoldeNOVA> No matter what people do, headbutts always look so fucking strong
[1:22:18] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The only good style is FREESTYLE
[1:22:20] <%starotter70> Always go for the eyes
[1:22:21] <aimlesshealer> Or a bag of doritos
[1:22:21] <Ion_Laser> or a bicycle
[1:22:22] <+TastySammiches> pat why do you forsake the mighty GUN
[1:22:22] <Nekros4442> Further proof that Cody is the stronger mfer ever
[1:22:23] <%Ahack13> Thats you should never fight with rules.
[1:22:23] <%JustToWatch> speaking of that have you seen Baki?
[1:22:26] <Prevot> MMA is the only worthwhile martial art
[1:22:27] <dekkitout> No amount of training will prepare you for- POCKET SAND!
[1:22:28] <%Ahack13> Honor is for chumps
[1:22:29] <rad_dude123465> That’s the whole premise behind a Baki arc
[1:22:29] <+dramajoe> i would beat the shit out of gsp on the streets
[1:22:30] <%shiplord13> Remember people fight like cheater
[1:22:31] <Xelhesia> the void episode was great i loved wooile marking out at Dante excedding the style ranking
[1:22:31] <Darren716> The only good style is GUN
[1:22:34] <Dovakhin573> I think thats the premise of Baki in netflix
[1:22:36] <logoth_> Look at Kiryu's running animation
[1:22:36] <$PulverKong> "You're not supposed to punch me when I perform this COOL MOVE"
[1:22:37] <Shir0yasha> box of nails
[1:22:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> luckily, for all it's flaws, bruce lee's style actually promoted ball attacks and fouls of all kinds
[1:22:48] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Speaking of MMA McGregor is retiring
[1:22:49] <rosemon5001> ooh lok a syringe on the ground let me stab you martial artist man @AngriestPat
[1:22:51] <logoth_> Essence of Box of Nails
[1:22:51] <%lewdskeletor13> I wonder what Kiryu would think of Dante
[1:22:53] <%SrG00SE> as someone whos taught martial arts, the first thing i taught my students was there is nothing i can show you or teach you that will stop a weapon, there are only ways to mitigate and remove them.
[1:22:56] <%starotter70> I think there's another one
[1:22:59] <televisedrevolting> Just Perfect Guard all they're attacks and Release when they attack again
[1:23:05] <TheNewJapanGuy> As an Irishman I've mastered that skill years ago
[1:23:08] <Shir0yasha> try that bottle on my royal guard
[1:23:10] <%Gogogolem> @PulverKong Also taekwan do kicks done by most people are really easy to grab and just throw them on the ground then beat their ass.
[1:23:14] <%Laecerelius> Look at all that fire to slam people's face in!
[1:23:19] <%SrG00SE> "if you face a knife, accept immediately that you will be cut"
[1:23:21] <+Grayhammatter> the ashina style
[1:23:22] <paiguy> This song horseGASM
[1:23:27] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat is Dr Faust a gun tho? Kappa
[1:23:28] <silverira> USE THAT STOVE
[1:23:28] <theoverlordgopher> Oh God, this room was fucked on my playthrough
[1:23:29] <%shiplord13> Cheating is the best type of fighting style, because it is impossible to predict and the most versatile style there is.
[1:23:31] <TheNewJapanGuy> THICC
[1:23:31] <+TastySammiches> 🔫
[1:23:31] <%connos_livereview> yeah ive got heavy drinking mastery too
[1:23:32] <ShreddingPixels> SourPls
[1:23:32] <aimlesshealer> Rule 1: win. Rule 2: don't lose
[1:23:32] <+Grayhammatter> the cooks? OH NO
[1:23:33] <InugamiTheHound> gun
[1:23:33] <%alexandrecau> throw a shuriken
[1:23:34] <%Josef_Stryker> ESSENSE OF GUN
[1:23:35] <PowerfulBlackGangs> THICC
[1:23:37] <$PulverKong> @SrG00SE yeah, if you see a knife, just run the fuck away
[1:23:39] <%supersugoisenpai1> Kiryu learns gunslinger
[1:23:40] <%connos_livereview> old man GUN
[1:23:42] <Ner234> Is Kiryu just gonna fuck up this whole restaurant? LUL
[1:23:42] <%alexandrecau> zhang
[1:23:42] <+frontlinecaster> Non lethally use that GUN Kiryu
[1:23:43] <Shir0yasha> so basically if u win, ur using the ashina style
[1:23:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat do the the unique heat move by the fire!
[1:23:45] <%Typhaeon> Unforgivable
[1:23:47] <Iggeh0> Unforgivable
[1:23:47] <+aivalera> Hey @AngriestPat did you see that DMCV tweet about going to mcdonalds after church?
[1:23:50] <%MagickBurritoh> won't forgive
[1:23:51] <TheNewJapanGuy> PIGHEAD
[1:23:53] <%alexandrecau> that's enough
[1:23:54] <$Mendin> Kitchen Battle
[1:23:54] <+frontlinecaster> PIG HEAD
[1:23:57] <%Gatzarlok> Why did only the dude at the front door have fully automatic weaponry?
[1:23:58] <+frontlinecaster> Get the pig head!!!
[1:24:00] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Kazuma "never killed anyone" Kiryu is about to shove somebody's face into a stove fire
[1:24:02] <+TastySammiches> shouldn't these guys be speaking chinese?
[1:24:02] <%VantomPayne> it means I wont forgive you
[1:24:03] <%SrG00SE> @PulverKong literally, 100% of real martial artists will tell you exactly that
[1:24:03] <devanmuse> Pig Advantage!!
[1:24:04] <%Exyoh> Little Chef and Little Chef are looking for action
[1:24:05] <%BigNerdSam> Did I miss Kiryu killing that guy?
[1:24:06] <%connos_livereview> IT means extreme

[1:24:13] <%starotter70> Shut up
[1:24:14] <Deano8817> OH JESUS

[1:24:22] <shaneok64> NEVER KILLED
[1:24:22] <+Reizie_Etherealm> To taunt?
[1:24:22] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Hes ok guys lool
[1:24:23] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Kiwami means yurusanai
[1:24:24] <+frontlinecaster> Definitely still alive
[1:24:24] <%DK_Rance> face not cooked
[1:24:25] <televisedrevolting> That's actually Dead tho
[1:24:29] <silverira> so you can feel ofended
[1:24:31] <Shir0yasha> but its yakuza kiwami not triads kiwami
[1:24:32] <%lewdskeletor13> Cause the Japanese love being offensive to the Chinese
[1:24:33] <+Grayhammatter> lies, he never kills
[1:24:33] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Get the Pig Advantage
[1:24:34] <Forester_Skippy> to make you feel bad
[1:24:34] <%connos_livereview> FUCK
[1:24:35] <+d00msdaydan> the answer is no because kiryu totally didn't kill that guy
[1:24:37] <%BigNerdSam> Shit
[1:24:37] <Xelhesia> lol definetly dead
[1:24:37] <%Edgy_Macaroon> they need to make sure you know
[1:24:39] <$PulverKong> @SrG00SE yes, because martial arts is taught as a SPORT, not an effective way of killing all your opponents anymore :)
[1:24:42] <+Grayhammatter> except for that one waiter
[1:24:42] <%laserbeaming> He got SUPER killed
[1:24:43] <logoth_> Kiwami means Manslaughter
[1:24:49] <%supersugoisenpai1> Remember that Punisher game where Frank shoves a guys head in a deep fryer?
[1:24:50] <+TastySammiches> kiryu didn't kill that guy, he just held him directly in front of the deadly bullets
[1:24:53] <TheNewJapanGuy> Feel The Heat Pat!
[1:24:53] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The legendary triad weapon, the kitchen knife
[1:24:54] <Prevot> don't worry, there's a lot more guys to kill
[1:25:00] <Shir0yasha> kiwami means everyone speaking Japanese
[1:25:00] <+frontlinecaster> It's bad because you don't have Pig Advantage Pat
[1:25:02] <BlacSoul> Didn’t shoot him, just kept himself from being shot
[1:25:03] <%DK_Rance> @BigNerdSam go to youtube and try and search kiryu human shield youll find the scene you missed
[1:25:04] <+d00msdaydan> really it's the gunman's fault for not holding fire after kiryu grabbed the guy
[1:25:13] <theoverlordgopher> Get the bacon, Pat
[1:25:16] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Use the pig Pat
[1:25:16] <%SrG00SE> @PulverKong yep, most american styles at least. they're taught for points not for survival.
[1:25:20] <%Exyoh> These fights get so much better when you're trying to rationalise them not dying
[1:25:21] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> It's around the point the difficulty gets BS without Tiger Drop
[1:25:25] <Deano8817> type up that time kiryu killed someone for the meme version
[1:25:25] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Turn them into stew!
[1:25:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Fuck you, Ma
[1:25:32] <$Quack_of_Dawn> @supersugoisenpai1 that shit's the most fucked kill in that game, my opinion
[1:25:40] <%nicoleymcquack> My neighbours are being super loud like come on guys I'm tryna watch Pat play Yakuza HAVE SOME RESPECT
[1:25:41] <silverira> whats the point in swearing in another language you lose all the moral damage that it would cause
[1:25:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat missed the shotguns in this area.
[1:25:58] <%connos_livereview> SourPls
[1:26:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> PIG HEAD?
[1:26:03] <%lewdskeletor13> Yakuzies always has good music
[1:26:14] <+aivalera> CHINA MAN
[1:26:14] <%laserbeaming> That's a nice chair
[1:26:17] <%Tearonex> HEY IT'S LAU!
[1:26:18] <televisedrevolting> I can hear it now.
[1:26:21] <+TastySammiches> I don't even speak japanese and I can tell he's speaking in broken japanese
[1:26:21] <Andrade9T> fuck for a second i tough the stage boss was tiny
[1:26:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> Did you need to tape up the girl's mouth?
[1:26:26] <%starotter70> Sounds like there's something stuck in his mouth
[1:26:29] <televisedrevolting> The heavy accent.
[1:26:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeaaaah. His accent is cartoony.
[1:26:38] <%alexandrecau> yes girl is annoying sometime
[1:26:44] <aimlesshealer> As opposed to the Canadian yakuza?
[1:26:48] <%lewdskeletor13> His accent sounds like a white person doing a black guy voice
[1:26:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You fuck young girls Lau Ka Long? That's fine, Cole Phelps says that's okay
[1:26:49] <Prevot> hah those dumb japanese yakuza
[1:26:49] <$PulverKong> @nicoleymcquack teach your neighbors respect the Kiryu way. Ring their doorbell and kick the door in their faces when they open
[1:26:52] <%nicoleymcquack> He's trying
[1:26:52] <TheNewJapanGuy> *gasp*
[1:26:53] <$valriot> Hes sounds like hes from Kung Pow
[1:26:54] <Sitromxe> *Angrily donates*
[1:26:55] <StromkoPenguin> Not like those Hong Kong Yakuza, those guys are geniuses in comparison
[1:26:55] <stabbityrabbit> You know, I don't speak Japanese but somehow I can hear the racism now.
[1:26:57] <Shir0yasha> he's talking like a text to speech
[1:26:58] <+aivalera> NISHIKIYAMA?!
[1:26:59] <devanmuse> Even his subtitles seem like they're written in broken english half the time
[1:27:09] <%collindoucet99> Kiryu is like Yakuza Geralt @angriestpat
[1:27:10] <%Exyoh> He's got this inflection that reminds me of Vinny's teletubby voice
[1:27:11] <%nitronLVIII> you can practically here the buck teeth
[1:27:15] <majindusto> HARUKA IS NOT ANNOYING, SHUT UP
[1:27:17] <$valriot> Tiger tiger tiger. hmmm, birdy. birdy birdy

[1:28:18] <theangryguyofde> 3rd worse, the other two have guns NotLikeThis
[1:28:19] <%lewdskeletor13> Shimano is the worst imo
[1:28:21] <%alexandrecau> @AngriestPat forgetting the Arai boss already?, he is the worst
[1:28:23] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I think the worst is still the serbian mob.
[1:28:26] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Oh this is probs the second best fight
[1:28:26] <%Typhaeon> That spinning attack looks so dumb

[1:28:37] <%ElenaManetta> pat said this is the worst fight in the game right
[1:28:37] <%snow_bush> Pick up the chair with the girl in it and hip him!
[1:28:38] <Graywolf_the_45th> I find any "guy with gun" boss fight to be the actual worst
[1:28:39] <Shir0yasha> the guns are the worst.. u know which one
[1:28:40] <earth2kev> Worse then the brothers?
[1:28:40] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Heat move him with Haruka
[1:28:42] <%collindoucet99> Worst? By quality or because it’s difficult?

[1:28:59] <dekkitout> What about that Ornstein and Smough like fight
[1:28:59] <televisedrevolting> That's dead
[1:29:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This fight is also much better if you use a weapon.
[1:29:02] <%shiplord13> Kiryu should be dead
[1:29:04] <%ScreamingMeat> Dead. Kiryu should be dead
[1:29:06] <%lewdskeletor13> USE THE MORTAL BLADE
[1:29:06] <$PulverKong> why can kiryu stand up after being lifted in the air with a spear
[1:29:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> How is kiryu not dead
[1:29:07] <%alexandrecau> Kiwami 2 had the only good boss with a gun in majima's sidestory
[1:29:08] <devanmuse> oh hey, you shattered that spear

[1:29:34] <stabbityrabbit> You know, I would count it the glaive as a point towards racism, but the yakuza also use katanas so I think it's fine.
[1:29:35] <Deano8817> Why aren't you royal guarding pat?
[1:29:36] <+aivalera> This fight is a lot more reasonable when you counter his weapons with your own
[1:29:36] <%lewdskeletor13> LUL
[1:29:36] <silverira> this fight sucks holy shit

[1:30:19] <%Exyoh> Look at those dinky cutlasses
[1:30:19] <%lewdskeletor13> The Japanese have a hard on for being racist towards the Chinese
[1:30:19] <Xelhesia> Niitoryu
[1:30:20] <+TastySammiches> VASE ON HEAD
[1:30:22] <theangryguyofde> I did this on hard mode, I carried ALOT of healing items

[1:31:04] <$PulverKong> just do shoryuken movements all the time and hit buttons
[1:31:05] <%alexandrecau> Pat you can heal there is no punishment on your rank
[1:31:07] <%collindoucet99> Pat use your EX Gauge
[1:31:07] <PowerfulBlackGangs> That guy upstairs should really be helping his boss
[1:31:10] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m amazed Haruka isn’t MORE traumatized
[1:31:10] <%snow_bush> Kiwami means NO HEALING
[1:31:13] <televisedrevolting> IGNITE THE FLAME! NOW!
[1:31:16] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wish it's more extreme than that
[1:31:17] <%BigNerdSam> Kiwami means steak.
[1:31:20] <The_500lb_Child> This is why you always carry a gun, incase people with swords appear.

[1:31:28] <$HentaiSenpai9K> 1
[1:31:29] <%king_wragles> @alexandrecau I think he only has full heals, so he's getting low before using them
[1:31:34] <%rdark_ksu> I like to imagine Haruka has been kidnapped so many times shes just sitting there bored out of her mind
[1:31:35] <%starotter70> Kiwami means racist accents
[1:31:41] <Desertfishing> drop your shield pat
[1:31:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Andrade9T You can do it against regular enemies too.
[1:31:43] <Shir0yasha> always carry tuna cannon
[1:31:49] <$PulverKong> People with swords can only fight other people with swords..so they kinda suck
[1:31:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Beast also has a heat move for stunned enemies.
[1:31:52] <%Niney_Who> IGNITE THE FLAME
[1:31:52] <joneworldbeater> I love the kid just sitting there watching this.
[1:31:54] <+Mtome> You can just use the katan if you have the skill which doesn't decrease durability if you have no heat and after imediately aquiring heat you can just stun lock him with that
[1:31:59] <SephirKath> Kick him in the junk!
[1:32:00] <%alexandrecau> full heals are cheap, he can pull 20 of those
[1:32:01] <%lewdskeletor13> Hey Niney apatDab
[1:32:04] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> If you have a weapon and heat drinks, you can just spam heat moves on the guy
[1:32:04] <%Niney_Who> apatDab
[1:32:05] <Ner234> Man, Haruka has seen some shit.
[1:32:13] <+aivalera> Mr Gun Guy, aka "reload your save and get the bulletproof vest" in Yakuza OG
[1:32:14] <devanmuse> @joneworldbeater I mean... she IS tied up
[1:32:15] <%connos_livereview> GUN is the strongest martial art
[1:32:15] <R3c0n31> I would say Sekiro has really changed in play through 2
[1:32:17] <+TastySammiches> 極[EXTREME]
[1:32:25] <+BlackAce186> oh this is would be a lot easier with full dragon style. Oh wait that would be every fight.
[1:32:27] <+DeeJayOkay> The Rush Kiwami is the best one, fucking fight me
[1:32:32] <Desertfishing> KIWAMI MEAN FIST TO FACE
[1:32:32] <Shir0yasha> kiwami means no damage

[1:32:43] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Lau Ka Long (Savage)
[1:32:45] <%lewdskeletor13> Kill him just like Batman woulda done
[1:32:46] <+DeeJayOkay> @Niney_Who i stand by my statement
[1:32:51] <$PulverKong> Kiwami means "tip your waiters dammit"
[1:32:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @BlackAce186 Even just leveling up Dragon Style as much as he could at this point would make this fight easier.
[1:32:53] <silverira> Kiwami means cheating
[1:32:54] <CastellanVon> Kiwami means worst mechanic ever
[1:32:58] <%nicoleymcquack> Kiwami means Shadows die twice because y'all been dead a good few times now
[1:33:03] <logoth_> Why does Kiryu have a fleshlight equipped
[1:33:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat's not going to be able to max out Dragon Style because he's not doing a lot of the minigames.
[1:33:08] <Shir0yasha> rush kiwami is straight up Kenshiro
[1:33:15] <0rond> does patty know you can charge that final rush kick for massive danage?
[1:33:20] <CastellanVon> Dragon style is trash in this game. Even upgraded. But Tiger Drop is straight up broken
[1:33:23] <Desertfishing> bwaaaaa
[1:33:29] <%bluetocho13> that exp tho
[1:33:31] <TheNewJapanGuy> aawwwh
[1:33:32] <%collindoucet99> Broke his neck
[1:33:33] <joneworldbeater> @devanmuse I know, but it's still hilarious
[1:33:33] <+frontlinecaster> So you're not traumatized or anything by that? Cool
[1:33:33] <+aivalera> Kiwami means Exceeded Expectations
[1:33:37] <%machshop> nani
[1:33:38] <%laserbeaming> When did she get untied?
[1:33:38] <+TastySammiches> @Shir0yasha it's more jojo than kenshiro, given the ORA ORA
[1:33:40] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Guns exist
[1:33:41] <Xelhesia> daughter has been savrd
[1:33:45] <%lewdskeletor13> Kiwami means bring the Dragons Heritage back west by ingesting and becoming pregnant with Kuro
[1:33:45] <%Josef_Stryker> AWKWARD
[1:33:45] <%starotter70> Kiryu you killed like 50 guys
[1:33:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dragon Style in Kiwami is MUCH better than Dragon Style in 0 by the end.

[1:34:08] <%lewdskeletor13> “Kiryu did you kill that guy up front???”
[1:34:14] <Buttsong> Kiwami means skateboarding
[1:34:15] <justafoxhere> What happened to the triads on the walkway above the fight
[1:34:17] <devanmuse> @joneworldbeater actually, given how she was able to get off the chair but still had ropes around her, it's possible she wasn't even tied TO the chair. She could have just walked off
[1:34:20] <0rond> if he had showed up earlier he would have been like "why are you kidnapping this nice chinese man's daughter?"
[1:34:20] <alrobot2014> back to prison
[1:34:22] <+BlackAce186> But dragon style in this game isn't trash...

[1:41:45] <+aivalera> Not only does that revolver hold 15 rounds, but Kiryu is also a talented gunslinger that can load those bullets in the span of a single second
[1:41:46] <+DoubleKayga> I mean you just shot all those people and they're fine, so why wouldn't you be fine from an RPG
[1:41:47] <TheBlankAce> Yeah the RPG will just put Kiryu to sleep

[1:41:49] <%collindoucet99> Japan fucking rules
[1:41:49] <alrobot2014> hey if kiryu didn't kill those other guys in those car explosions i'll believe haruka can survive an rpg

[1:41:50] <%Agami23> well, it doesent kill their men when you shoot them with guns. so why should it kill you?

[1:42:18] <+frontlinecaster> Kiryu doesn't kill
[1:42:18] <%El_Desperad0> Explains a lot
[1:42:19] <%connos_livereview> actually a fulton launcher
[1:42:19] <InugamiTheHound> Japanese devs don't know anything about guns?
[1:42:19] <+Vexen4th> Wasn't it super janky in the original too
[1:42:19] <$Tuskor13> But Kiryu never killed anyone
[1:42:20] <+DoubleKayga> worlds slowest rocket
[1:42:21] <Paradocks23> Those are very poor bullets.
[1:42:23] <+aivalera> Was it? I didn't remember this at all
[1:42:25] <+TastySammiches> well yeah, it's canon
[1:42:27] <simulationbard> @aivalera He's using a speed loader don't worry about it
[1:42:31] <%lewdskeletor13> NEVER KILLS THO
[1:42:35] <%connos_livereview> it was bad
[1:42:38] <%Toynota10> Kiryu sure can eat bullets
[1:42:39] <Andrade9T> it does look like a sequence from a long time ago
[1:42:41] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Is this Virtua Cop?
[1:42:42] <%Solidnick18> GET THE GUN TRUCK
[1:42:42] <ancrest_tant> I go to Japan often...I hate it when the yakuza have gun fights on the highway
[1:42:43] <T_Sasquatch> yeyeye i missed the bginning of this. this is the worst shit i have ever had to play. fuck this section
[1:42:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is a long free highway
[1:42:47] <Desertfishing> the fuck was that turn
[1:42:48] <Ner234> This is SO Dumb LUL I love it

[1:42:54] <SirDogBear> this truck part still gives me ptsd in legend difficulty
[1:42:56] <%Exyoh> How the fuck did they stay standing on that swerve?!
[1:42:57] <The_500lb_Child> Didnt this game come with a Lightgun?
[1:42:57] <%supersugoisenpai1> Kiryu must have spent a lot of time at the range to shoot a rocket. Good thing everyone has guns in Japan
[1:42:58] <T_Sasquatch> "kiryu doesnt kill anyone"
[1:42:58] <Basch71> this bit IIRC was harder in the ps2 version
[1:42:59] <+frontlinecaster> I love how it's a revolver but they still gave it 15 rounds and instant reload
[1:43:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Shoot the unarmed driver, Kiryu
[1:43:00] <DRAGKUDO> how much does he have
[1:43:02] <+TastySammiches> @Shir0yasha this is 2005
[1:43:04] <%Solidnick18> Oof
[1:43:05] <dekkitout> Kiryu has paracausal bullets you see, while he fataly shot them, he didn't kill them
[1:43:07] <TomCrimson> Yeah these dudes are totally alive after this, 100%
[1:43:10] <%Luna_Ashford> Its stupid but you love it nerd!
[1:43:10] <Shir0yasha> I mean 2005
[1:43:10] <RichAnvils> 15 shot revolver eh?
[1:43:10] <Siebersboy> I love how stupid this is
[1:43:11] <+MrRabbles> not only 15 rounds but this cop car was stored with tons of ammo just for this situation
[1:43:12] <+berserkscarlett> Imagine this in real life....

[1:43:21] <%WhackyChiraqi> I've watched this motherfucker for like a decade on YouTube and this is the first time I've ever been able to give him 5 dollars
[1:43:22] <$Tuskor13> This feels like an arcade game where the controller is a big plastic gun but you're using an actual controller
[1:43:23] <%Gatzarlok> They must be in the ghetto because police response to what would be the biggest terrorist attack ever is a little slow
[1:43:23] <alrobot2014> i'm still trying to figure out how 15 bullets fit in the revolver
[1:43:25] <DRAGKUDO> why not just shoot the driver?
[1:43:26] <%Solidnick18> date has insane driving skills
[1:43:26] <+frontlinecaster> Is this even a cop car? Or just Date's car?

[1:43:29] <%snow_bush> Wait, how does that revolver hold 15 shots?
[1:43:29] <TheNewJapanGuy> I want the truck to Transform so Kiryu can punch it
[1:43:30] <%connos_livereview> yakuza 1 is actually like 2001
[1:43:31] <indig0bird> How many bullets was Date carrying?
[1:43:33] <+tymetak> wow
[1:43:34] <%Solidnick18> yes
[1:43:35] <$TheCrispyBoi> this has gone on for way too long

[1:43:37] <%Tucker0603> that revolver should only hold 6
[1:43:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Is this Sekiro?
[1:43:38] <Prevot> yeah
[1:43:39] <omen_setter> date stole a fucking armory's worth of ammo from the police station

[1:48:35] <%nicoleymcquack> Why does he look too big for that car
[1:48:38] <InugamiTheHound> Nishikiyama looks like Tachibana
[1:48:41] <Seitine> He got fucking Yaoi hands.
[1:48:43] <Jrockoni> that car looks straight out of a ps3 game
[1:48:47] <+creamandsugar> i love how tiny that friggin phone is in kiryu's giant gorrila hands
[1:48:49] <%alexandrecau> Kiryu is a big man
[1:48:51] <%collindoucet99> Yakuza is like 6’5
[1:48:52] <CastellanVon> @AngriestPat Do the sidequest in Purgatory with the interviewer. It's the best in the game.
[1:48:54] <+TastySammiches> @Jrockoni this is a PS3 game

[1:48:59] <Iggeh0> noble hobos

[1:49:35] <%serpenttucker> @AngriestPat so this game also subscribes to the Fat evil noble hobo tropes?
[1:49:38] <%lewdskeletor13> I think Zero and Kiwami made Nishki a WAY better character
[1:49:40] <CryptusMaximus> Dont worry. We'll protect you with our lack of money
[1:49:44] <0rond> a florist is someone that deals with flower
[1:49:47] <%bread_assassin> Remember how Pat spent the whole Yakuza 0 LP hating on Nishiki for things he wouldn't do for another 17 years?

[1:51:52] <$Mendin> Because Reina wanted to climb Mt Nishikiyama
[1:51:53] <+Sulfur_Boride> @D4C_Trice Actually, I believe it was mere allegations of doing drugs that got him blacklisted, and he might have actually been cleared of those allegations later, but those allegations still hurt his rep, and he left acting for good.
[1:51:56] <+TastySammiches> look a kiryu's bitchy resting face and his eyes not moving
[1:51:57] <+zaworldo> REALLY!!?!
[1:52:00] <$D4C_Trice> @collindoucet99 what about that human shield of a waiter he used to not get shot,

[1:52:16] <0rond> REINA JUST WANTED THE D
[1:52:16] <+Grayhammatter> that's a lot of blood
[1:52:16] <KatabolicRage> with the hindsight of zero in mind nishiki is even less of a threat in this, he's such a jobber

[1:56:09] <%nicoleymcquack> In Japan they're too embarrased that it's someones period so they just pretend it's not there
[1:56:13] <Shir0yasha> the essence of getting beat up

[1:56:36] <CastellanVon> Huh so the Ufotable thing is like the Gainax thing back then. They were pulling in too much money and instead of reporting it, they put it into non-reported bank accounts.

[1:58:34] <KatabolicRage> is he still playing bloodlines on friday? cos he needs the usual caveats of that game still being kinda jank even with patches
[1:58:39] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @AngriestPat When are you going to play shitty games you think are good again? Kappa
[1:58:40] <%blastazoid26> Xenoblade is a shitty game, play that

[1:59:34] <+Grayhammatter> that guy is DEAD
[1:59:35] <+Reizie_Etherealm> That's fucked
[1:59:35] <KatabolicRage> if he plays that with anything other than the basic version of the unofficial patch I will burst a blood vessel
[1:59:35] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I love that game, but it IS pretty shitty
[1:59:35] <%DK_Rance> @count_bob lets be real pat already is nosforatu LUL
[1:59:35] <+3InchMensch> If he gets the GOG version, he should be good to go

[1:59:39] <0rond> THAT GUY IS OK
[1:59:40] <Ion_Laser> GODDAMN LUL
[1:59:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> you killed that guy
[1:59:40] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Maybe you can do a blitz night where you play through Steam games you've never/barely touched for half an hour each?
[1:59:42] <%ShogunNoonto> lies
[1:59:43] <dekkitout> That was fucking radical!
[1:59:43] <T_Sasquatch> can you not play games i want to play, thanks pat
[1:59:45] <ShershaAD> Would kiryus stando be called "Judgement"?
[1:59:45] <phatballlz54> kiryu doesn't kill people
[1:59:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> That's not even rad, that's horrible
[1:59:46] <AoG_JarlRaven> He's fine...
[1:59:50] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@0rond) (warning)
[1:59:56] <Zinax7> @AngriestPat did you hear that max quit sekiro cuz of the last boss?
[1:59:57] <Shir0yasha> even if he's alive, he's just gonna be a burden
[1:59:59] <count_bob> Exactly! @DK_Rance He'll feel right at home.
[2:00:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Toynota10 That is an awful idea.
[2:00:02] <%Luna_Ashford> Because that is a sentence that makes sense.
[2:00:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kiryu's stand would just be Kiryu.
[2:00:11] <%Luna_Ashford> I'm going to buy a bulletproof amulet
[2:00:11] <0rond> @AngriestPat you can start street enouncters with a beast grab heat move to just remove 3 enemies, grabbing also gives you tons of heat
[2:00:17] <%TIME_PUNCHER> VTMB is a contradiction wrapped in a paradox coated in an oxymoron with how bad, yet also amazing, it is.
[2:00:18] <$Quack_of_Dawn> It's okay, just two dislocated arms and a spinal fracture
[2:00:20] <minidude34> rofl max quit sekiro?
[2:00:21] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I'd imagine it would take a literal day to get it set
[2:00:22] <doctor_be> Talk to Vinny Vinesauce about doing that, he does it often
[2:00:25] <joneworldbeater> Bloodlines isn't shitty, it just looks and plays shitty
[2:00:31] <foreverN2dust> Vampire is the buggiest game I've ever played, good luck getting it working for stream.
[2:00:35] <KatabolicRage> VTMB is just unfinished, it's a great game but you can see the exact moment the lights got turned off

[2:34:20] <+aivalera> It wasn't, there were only six and each one had a cinematic
[2:34:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is smelly
[2:34:26] <+frontlinecaster> Go do karaoke while Shingi dies!
[2:34:27] <RichAnvils> in Japan the Yakuza series is "Like A DILF"
[2:34:35] <+HellCopter> Yakuza 6 is such a blast!
[2:34:36] <Run44forrest> Do the weird sex card game sidestory
[2:34:37] <%Hiro01231> as a 0erson not an event
[2:34:37] <MetalDeerS0LID> Is there pachinko in this game? I missed it in 0
[2:34:38] <Sunditsu> I really doubt the term DILF was a thing when Yakuza 1 was released
[2:34:40] <%bread_assassin> Not the minigame, the man.
[2:34:44] <TheNewJapanGuy> Ryu Ga DILF
[2:34:50] <ManfredA> the sex card game is fun
[2:34:55] <redial_nick> the remaster is coming just wait
[2:34:58] <%lewdskeletor13> I don’t think the word DILF even existed back then
[2:34:59] <NeroInfinite> @AngriestPat Slot racing is only in this game. Pocket is just a side quest for six.
[2:35:03] <PowerfulBlackGangs> 5 was mad lame

[2:35:08] <+Das_Bass> 6 is really good

[2:38:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @InkyDraconian I'm not going to support his channel just because it exists as a channel. You're saying his channel should be supported over a corporation just because he's a youtuber, just because he's a person with this profession.

[2:40:08] <InugamiTheHound> where's dragon dogma on this stream?

[2:40:21] <%bluetocho13> it does more damage the more heat you have
[2:40:21] <%connos_livereview> @drugbustincat YES
[2:40:21] <GoldeNOVA> How many P-sans want to bone Majima?
[2:40:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @InkyDraconian I could not give less of a shit who the top youtuber is. You realize the highest watched videos are still cute animal clips right?

[2:44:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 44m.
[2:44:29] <%bluetocho13> someone tell that to pat
[2:44:34] <InkyDraconian> @Wrashis @Too_Much_Nukie well i guess i can't argue against personal taste
[2:44:35] <+zaworldo> So why is he not using the legend style? i mean it's fine but
[2:44:38] <%Nomad_Scholar> no
[2:44:41] <dekkitout> Is Godspeed when he moves so fast, there's two of him?
[2:44:43] <Smaenus> @bluetocho13 We have, he refuses LUL
[2:44:48] <+frontlinecaster> Nah
[2:44:52] <majindusto> Shinj is Jerky by now!
[2:44:52] <%shiplord13> Nah, he can wait longer
[2:44:52] <+frontlinecaster> Go bowling instead
[2:44:53] <+Grayhammatter> should prolly go see shinji's corpse
[2:44:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ehh
[2:44:58] <%alexandrecau> Shinji got this
[2:44:59] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Nah, Shinji's fine, go bowling
[2:44:59] <Run44forrest> Do karaoke
[2:45:00] <%starotter70> He's fine
[2:45:01] <TheNewJapanGuy> He's probably fine...
[2:45:01] <SirDogBear> you can help shinji after some rounds of mahjong
[2:45:02] <%shiplord13> He's dead by now so no rush
[2:45:04] <BlacSoul> Bring flowers
[2:45:05] <phatballlz54> he'll be fine!
[2:45:06] <InugamiTheHound> batting cages instead
[2:45:09] <+MrRabbles> because dragon style sucks unless you have the majority of its skill tree unlocked
[2:45:23] <+zaworldo> But he has 18/18 skills for it
[2:45:25] <%bluetocho13> but its easy and you dont need to do the whole quest
[2:45:29] <Ner234> I just realized; are these streets always wet?

[2:46:08] <+aivalera> But what does trickster do to it?
[2:46:09] <%tweedler92> I didn't expect Woolie to be that bad LUL
[2:46:09] <Run44forrest> Not having dragon kiwami heatmove sucks. Bad game design
[2:46:11] <+Grayhammatter> hat is gun
[2:46:11] <ManOfReason> but swordmaster tho
[2:46:12] <%Birdigalore> -Woolie heavy sweating_ Episode 30

[2:46:28] <%CerberusDriver> The hype melted Woolies brain
[2:46:30] <joneworldbeater> IT'S AGUN
[2:46:30] <phatballlz54> but what does it do in royal guard?

[2:46:40] <%laserbeaming> Someone should make that "This is a pipe" meme, but with a hat, and it should say "This is a gun"
[2:46:41] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat did you know if you hold down gunslinger with double kalina anne you can put one down?
[2:46:43] <%shiplord13> How does this guy not sense Kiryu's DILF engergy
[2:46:44] <troxcree> You can't expect a Nero main to truly understand the complexities of Dante's style.

[2:48:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Run44forrest Time of Godspeed. One of the highest abilities in the game.
[2:48:37] <Scorian> Kiryu is a badass
[2:48:38] <dekkitout> A large man, glowing with purple sex energy, kicks your door down? What do you do?
[2:48:40] <%NWR_James> @SirDogBear sometimes he boots them open. Nobody told him how knobs work
[2:48:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The yellow burst was Time of the Destroyer.
[2:48:51] <TalisKanju> Woolie is the chessmaster
[2:48:53] <%cvp5127> Which of kiryus style is gunslinger?
[2:48:57] <alrobot2014> @dekkitout bow before his DILFhood
[2:48:57] <%MagickBurritoh> Is Kiryu a stand user with his body as the stand?

[2:49:21] <+zaworldo> kIRYU IS BOTH STAND USER and STAND
[2:49:21] <%NWR_James> Kiryu is his own stand

[2:49:53] <%AncelDeLambert> AncelDeLambert subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey, Pat, I've had the flu for the last week and a half, and had a weird fever dream where Dante was Trickster dodging through a jumprope during a double dutch session with two little girls, the jumpropes spinning at light speed and red orbs showering out
[2:49:56] <%Niney_Who> Other one is better tbh
[2:49:58] <zerocruz> Time for destruction+Rush= TRUE POWER
[2:50:05] <+JacktheMan18> SourPls
[2:50:10] <%NWR_James> The actions of the bad guys in this game are infinitely more insane once you added Yakuza 0 to the plot. They saw this dude rip the entire Tojo HQ apart.
[2:50:10] <%galaxyswirl> TRICKSTER
[2:50:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to be fast though, so it's easiest to start with Time of QingLong, the one that gives infinite heat.
[2:50:14] <%connos_livereview> yakuza is a pretty cool guy and doesnt afraid of anything
[2:50:16] <+aivalera> @AncelDeLambert That's rad!!

[3:01:19] <KatabolicRage> No, and all those people he shot on the highway were shot with rubber bullets, fell out of rubber cars, onto the bouncy rubber highway
[3:01:19] <+aivalera> That doesn't count as a knockdown, only a knockback
[3:01:26] <Ion_Laser> @MrSuperCasualBoom that's definitely true on the main roster

[3:02:16] <+aivalera> Yeah, Rush makes the gun fights a lot more easier
[3:02:26] <gustavozxd> I still prefer the original PS2 version of 1, didn't even care about playing kiwami 2 after that
[3:02:28] <+Evitron1> kiwami is just yakuza zero+ but without money coming out of everyone whenever you punch them

[3:06:56] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> A lot of the Yakuuzie 1 bosses were way more grounded in the original, but the gameplay was way more clunky, so even the chuuni ass stuff they're doing is easier to deal with with the added mobility

[3:16:10] <+Shastafield> LUL
[3:16:11] <+Evitron1> majima time ya silly bich
[3:16:14] <+Ell1ot> this Majima guy seems to be everywhere
[3:16:18] <%Gatzarlok> No one shakes down Kiryu but majima himself!
[3:16:19] <+SimplesRock> oh that health bar
[3:16:19] <TheNewJapanGuy> "Majima, two of my friends JUST died.. could we take a rain-check??"
[3:16:20] <%hntronium> Where's that MISTER SHAKEDOWN
[3:16:20] <nobody12349> HE'S DANClNG ALL OVER YOU
[3:16:25] <Strider222> majima is a really cool guy
[3:16:26] <%drabberfaun535> why isint he getting yen from hitting them?
[3:16:29] <MarylandJutsu> @Ell1ot in a sort of....system ifyou would
[3:16:32] <%SaltyDongs> Get styled on
[3:16:34] <majindusto> TONIGHT IS MAJIMA NIGHT!!!
[3:16:35] <TheNewJapanGuy> Yes
[3:16:40] <%lewdskeletor13> @drabberfaun535 Cause that was only in Zero
[3:16:40] <Run44forrest> everyone a yakuza till majima start dancin 😔
[3:16:43] <%Tucker0603> MAJIMA is the best
[3:16:45] <%Keyd00d> Kiwami 2 is much better than 1
[3:16:47] <+HellCopter> That's why this game is cheaper
[3:16:47] <alrobot2014> majima does this to cheer kiryu up after all that death
[3:16:49] <%battlepope99> what's kiwami 2 like?
[3:16:51] <tj_timbs> Kiwami is just an extension of 0 really
[3:16:51] <@commanderclaw> I feel like the combat is better in Kiwami, but everything else is better in Zero
[3:16:53] <T_Sasquatch> yes
[3:16:55] <+HellCopter> This is like Yakuza 0 DLC
[3:17:00] <tj_timbs> Kiwami 2 is one of the best in the series though
[3:17:00] <TheNewJapanGuy> Kiwami 2 is much better than K1
[3:17:01] <%Das_Bass> 2 is my fave for sure
[3:17:03] <%GarbageNirvana> How much more could you change it without making it unrecognizable from the first game
[3:17:05] <%MagickBurritoh> ohno
[3:17:05] <Basch71> Kiwami feels 1:1 if you have already played the original besides the new secnes
[3:17:05] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> They should included in the next Virtua Fighter at this point
[3:17:06] <%Kduff89> nice taunt LUL
[3:17:09] <+HellCopter> the Dragon Engine is so coool
[3:17:11] <+SimplesRock> @MarylandJutsu we could implement said 'system', bringing the joy of Majima to many places. perhaps even... all places
[3:17:15] <+aivalera> Kiwami 2 is the best yakuza game so far
[3:17:19] <T_Sasquatch> i actually like kiwamis combat more than 1
[3:17:20] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s just a remake with Zeroes graphics, not much else they could’ve done
[3:17:21] <%laserbeaming> Kiryu needs Royal Guard
[3:17:28] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> The trick in kiwami is crushing everyone with the broken tiger drop
[3:17:28] <%Toynota10> don't worry you'll like Kiwami 2 a lot more
[3:17:32] <Strider222> wow
[3:17:38] <+Castlecaedo96> i feel like kiwami 2 is a bit better
[3:17:43] <T_Sasquatch> i think kiwami 2 has the best combat but its piss wasy and i think its story is retarded
[3:17:53] <Run44forrest> he kicked the shit out of that bike
[3:17:55] <MarylandJutsu> what does kiwami 2 bring to the table?
[3:17:56] <%Das_Bass> 2,0.4.6,1,3 in that order
[3:17:57] <T_Sasquatch> easy*
[3:18:00] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> He got a BI-cycle!!!
[3:18:02] <%lewdskeletor13> @t_sasquatch C’mon now let’s not apatWhat
[3:18:13] <r_Foeburden87> Majima sellinmg hands
[3:18:15] <%CerberusDriver> 2 has an amazing rival
[3:18:16] <dekkitout> Using your ass to clean his shoes
[3:18:17] <Basch71> Ryuji's dope
[3:18:21] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 alright, Imma front with you. How much you want for a shill stream? If it's over $300 I'll need a week or 2 to get it together(with an additional 2 for every 300). I won't force you to play a single game, rather, I'd give you the option from a list of 10 or so games.
[3:18:23] <TheNewJapanGuy> Elmo Everywhere System
[3:18:25] <tj_timbs> @AngriestPat so are you gonna play Kiwami 2 next or
[3:18:27] <%Das_Bass> you fight fucking tigers
[3:18:31] <MarylandJutsu> Emlo up to mischief
[3:18:32] <%Toynota10> Kiwami 2 does some great stuff with Majima
[3:18:35] <HollowMan190> Kamwi 2 combat is garbage tho
[3:18:38] <+Grayhammatter> he dealt with it
[3:18:39] <artoflec> @MarylandJutsu its a totally different combat system, uhh, you can charge basically every move and it has a totally new physics ssystem, no transitions into battles etc.
[3:18:39] <InugamiTheHound> no virtua fighter 6 yet
[3:18:42] <SirDogBear> at least kiwami 1 gave the public a good dose of majima, its still not enough but you gotta start somewhere
[3:18:43] <%lewdskeletor13> You can also play as Majima in Kiwami 2 so that makes it great
[3:18:46] <detovini> DO IT
[3:18:51] <%starotter70> You can piss in that game!
[3:18:52] <%SaltyDongs> I saw that electricity come off him
[3:18:52] <%Tucker0603> try resolve against majima
[3:18:54] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat kyru has devil trigger??
[3:18:55] <MarylandJutsu> @artoflec neat
[3:18:55] <%nitronLVIII> ORA ORA
[3:18:56] <%Piemen99> muda muda muda muda
[3:18:58] <+RushUnplugged> the hypest move
[3:18:58] <Ion_Laser> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[3:18:58] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> 2 is a mix of amazing villain and complete crazy batshit
[3:18:59] <LeonSteel> DO IT COWARD
[3:19:04] <%connos_livereview> FOTNS then KIWAMERS 2 pls
[3:19:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think he should go for finishing 5 finally
[3:19:06] <Run44forrest> @awsomesaucekirby 🤨
[3:19:06] <+aivalera> Yes
[3:19:07] <Strider222> there are no styles in kiwami 2
[3:19:08] <TheNewJapanGuy> Yes
[3:19:09] <gustavozxd> Yakuza 2 is the game that they actually gave majima some character development, cause 1 he didn't really do much
[3:19:10] <%Toynota10> YUP
[3:19:12] <+RueOrin> Yep
[3:19:12] <tj_timbs> yes
[3:19:14] <majindusto> MAD DOG YES
[3:19:14] <TheNewJapanGuy> Yeah Mad Dog
[3:19:17] <%Edgy_Macaroon> kiwami 2 majima side story is great
[3:19:21] <tj_timbs> Majima is horribly limited in Kiwami 2 unfortunately
[3:19:21] <%alexandrecau> a really crippled one but yes
[3:19:22] <%El_Desperad0> Does 0 have dragon style?
[3:19:22] <$AbsoluteUppercut> You probably don't want to get burnt out before Judgement
[3:19:23] <+aivalera> @AngriestPat Temper your expecatations for Majima in kiwami 2
[3:19:25] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> !stream time
[3:19:29] <%Toynota10> He's pretty OP. His only upgrades are for health and heat
[3:19:30] <$Mendin> The first time he fought you in the game when you got out of jail he was using Mad Dog style
[3:19:30] <detovini> DMX STYLE
[3:19:31] <MarylandJutsu> @Plague_Nurse yeah but you unlock it near the end
[3:19:34] <TheNewJapanGuy> NO
[3:19:35] <+RueOrin> Kiwami 2 is so much better than Kiwami
[3:19:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Majima literally uses Majima style
[3:19:40] <Deano8817> Majima's side story is short as hell
[3:19:42] <InugamiTheHound> @Plague_Nurse yes but you have to unlock it same with Majima's best moves
[3:19:43] <%MelBrooksKA> !uptime
[3:19:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 19m.
[3:19:49] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Majima gets three chapters throughout the game
[3:19:51] <%Keyd00d> majima's story is just like 3-4 hours
[3:19:52] <TheNewJapanGuy> No its 3 Chapthers
[3:19:52] <%Das_Bass> @AngriestPat in K2 Majima only fights with the knife and its a side story on its own
[3:19:53] <%alexandrecau> majima has three chapters not making an hour
[3:19:55] <StromkoPenguin> Majima developed this style to show off his sick glowing shoes.
[3:19:55] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> majima story is like 2 hours
[3:19:57] <%El_Desperad0> @MarylandJutsu thanks
[3:19:58] <+aivalera> Kiwami 2 Majima is 3 two hour long missions strung together
[3:20:00] <T_Sasquatch> @MarylandJutsu its literally just better in every way interms of combat , animations, interactability , you can throw people through store windows then walk into the store
[3:20:02] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Whoa, missed a lot of stream
[3:20:03] <%lewdskeletor13> Majima sections are not as much as Kiryus
[3:20:04] <artoflec> im still early in kiwami 2 but i love it, i heard people didnt like 6's system but kiwami 2 apparently is just that but done a lot better
[3:20:04] <TheNewJapanGuy> Yea..
[3:20:05] <%starotter70> It's quite short
[3:20:07] <%alexandrecau> the clan battle is the good stuff
[3:20:17] <majindusto> BUT ITS REALLY GOOD
[3:20:17] <tj_timbs> and his chapters unlock as you progress through the main story
[3:20:18] <%Wrashis> 3 is more than 0
[3:20:19] <MarylandJutsu> @T_Sasquatch ohhh damn thats neat
[3:20:19] <Scorian> its enjoyable though
[3:20:21] <Otatoptohami> yeah he doesnt get much content at all
[3:20:22] <Deano8817> ORAORAORA
[3:20:24] <+aivalera> You start out with all abilities, there are no side missions besides fighting people
[3:20:28] <Run44forrest> but he gets sidestories right?
[3:20:29] <MarylandJutsu> JO JO
[3:20:30] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat The ending of his story is really nice though
[3:20:31] <%nitronLVIII> ORA
[3:20:31] <%Das_Bass> it ties up things from 0
[3:20:33] <%Nobrev> 極
[3:20:34] <%Piemen99> muda muda muda
[3:20:35] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> 「Judgement」is unbreakable
[3:20:38] <+RueOrin> You unlock Majima chapters as you play the main campaign, they don't interweave into the main campaign
[3:20:42] <%Keyd00d> ther'es some good closure for majima
[3:20:44] <Deano8817> The ending to Majima's side story alone makes it so fucking worth it
[3:20:45] <%connos_livereview> whens the majima stand alone story
[3:20:45] <T_Sasquatch> @lewdskeletor13 i completely stand by what i said, the final boss is the dumbest thing ever , it didnt have to happen
[3:20:46] <+zaworldo> Kiwami means extreme
[3:20:46] <%lewdskeletor13> 3 is better than none and it ties into zero
[3:20:46] <+JackMillerTime> man that jacket is cool
[3:20:46] <Scorian> LUL
[3:20:46] <%alexandrecau> majima gets no sidestory
[3:20:50] <%starotter70> Try the blue one
[3:20:59] <%Tucker0603> Try Resolve
[3:21:00] <tj_timbs> least Kiwami 2 doesn't deprive you of Majima like Yakuza 6 does, holy shit
[3:21:05] <MarylandJutsu> @connos_livereview the closest we'll get is 0
[3:21:05] <T_Sasquatch> @MarylandJutsu literally google yakuza kiwami 2 combat, its insane
[3:21:12] <+Grayhammatter> you still are
[3:21:19] <%connos_livereview> a man can dream
[3:21:21] <%lewdskeletor13> @t_sasquatch Your use of a certain word was unnecessary. That’s all i took issue with
[3:21:22] <+aivalera> @AngriestPat Kiwami 2's Majima chapters only serves to round out his story, expect nothing more
[3:21:25] <InugamiTheHound> chug those Japanese 5-hour energy drinks
[3:21:28] <%Das_Bass> the lack of majima in 6 was sad
[3:21:32] <MarylandJutsu> I'll def check out kiwami 2, cause I really loved kiwami
[3:21:49] <Ner234> Man, I just looked up a picture of Majima in Yakuza 6 and that does not look like a 52 year old. Seriously do these guys age?
[3:21:50] <%gespenst25> What is this bull-crapoera?
[3:21:54] <artoflec> oh also the new engine that kiwami 2 has is really IMMERSIVE and you can walk around in first person and just look at everything
[3:21:54] <%Toynota10> Man I wish there was behind the scenes stuff showing Majima's VA having fun lol
[3:21:55] <%Edgy_Macaroon> majima chapters give closure to a story from 0
[3:22:02] <tj_timbs> Majima was introduced in 6 like he was actually gonna be a main character but he's only in like 2 scenes
[3:22:11] <%alexandrecau> kiwami 2 also has the BEST colisseum fights , free 4 all with wrestlers and tigers
[3:22:14] <MarylandJutsu> @artoflec ive seen some older japanese people who look nothing CLOSE to their actual age
[3:22:16] <%Wrashis> man i must have missed a shitton of strem last i remember majima was at like c
[3:22:19] <TheNewJapanGuy> Noice
[3:22:21] <+aivalera> Is Majima an antagonist in Judgment??
[3:22:23] <%Gatzarlok> Y'all remember when Kiryu had 3 bajillion yen?
[3:22:26] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat when colliseum stream?
[3:22:27] <majindusto> Yeah, Majima is totally shafted in 6
[3:22:31] <T_Sasquatch> @lewdskeletor13 ohh lytWAH
[3:22:33] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Are you going to fight Amon? Cause I want to see you get turned inside out
[3:22:34] <artoflec> @MarylandJutsu haha yeah
[3:22:34] <gustavozxd> Haruka is the only one that ages because they want to **** her but anyway
[3:22:37] <Run44forrest> he blew it all on soaplands
[3:22:54] <+Grayhammatter> bummer
[3:22:54] <%lewdskeletor13> Remember when Kiryu was the Realtor King of Kamorucho?
[3:22:55] <majindusto> COWARD
[3:22:57] <Run44forrest> @gustavozxd 🤨
[3:22:59] <InugamiTheHound> kuwabara, kuwabara, kuwabara
[3:23:02] <%Das_Bass> Pat what's your favorite Yakuza game?
[3:23:04] <artoflec> i personally could never do these games and not try to do all the substories
[3:23:05] <TheNewJapanGuy> But DILF was a sub-story!
[3:23:07] <%SaltyDongs> Is there an HxH game
[3:23:08] <MarylandJutsu> @artoflec like some game deveolpers are like in their 50s and they look 30 itws ridic
[3:23:08] <TioXyco> gotta do the colisseum if you wanna max dragon style
[3:23:11] <+Grayhammatter> not dead
[3:23:12] <%XzileGaming> twist that face
[3:23:28] <artoflec> @MarylandJutsu yeah it makes me want to like..eat better and live a better lifestyle but elaSmile
[3:23:30] <MarylandJutsu> get guud pat
[3:23:33] <+logoth_> remember that time kiryu bought porn
[3:23:35] <%lewdskeletor13> I still think Zero is the best game
[3:23:35] <MarylandJutsu> amen art. amen
[3:23:39] <+zaworldo> So he's never using dragon style, right?
[3:23:50] <tj_timbs> if you bother to do coliseum, you'll get Tiger Drop which is super busted in this game
[3:23:57] <alwayspronking> I think that move is straight up a dick punch
[3:23:59] <Run44forrest> remember when kiryu had that solid gold kiryu statue built
[3:24:06] <%Toynota10> You wanna call it a night then?
[3:24:09] <+aivalera> @AngriestPat It's not that bad
[3:24:10] <Desertfishing> feels like home eh
[3:24:14] <%Wrashis> @AngriestPat did you ever find out what was wrong with woolie's controller, the suspense is killing me about 5 mins every dmc5 ep
[3:24:28] <tj_timbs> you're gonna have a fun time with Jingu i bet
[3:24:29] <Run44forrest> @wrashis it was haunted
[3:24:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Remember when Kiryu has billions of dollars in the 80s?
[3:24:31] <MarylandJutsu> yeah Shangri-La is a bit of an ordeal
[3:24:35] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> tiger drop really lets ya breeze majima tho
[3:24:40] <oddly_offensive> I could never beat the Highway shooting section for this game :(
[3:24:45] <%alexandrecau> @AngriestPat have you done the judoka substory?
[3:24:51] <Dapper_Cactuar> I love the car door heat move
[3:24:57] <TheNewJapanGuy> Tiger Dropped
[3:25:03] <%Keyd00d> F bag

[3:40:26] <%afronooch> yeah as long it makes/saves business money it ain't changing
[3:40:31] <%hntronium> Fuck people who want tips even though they didn't give decent service
[3:40:37] <%PlainSimpleTailor> That's how it is on this bitch of an earth
[3:40:41] <%MelBrooksKA> Anyone got a time stamp for tipping? This sounds interesting
[3:40:44] <%lewdskeletor13> NOT TIPPING doesn’t hurt the business genius, it just hurts the server
[3:40:44] <%NWR_James> this is false
[3:40:48] <%ThDark> I work for tips, not tipping only affects the individual worker/server, the business makes all the money they would have made regardless.
[3:40:59] <%ThDark> Tips literally buy me food
[3:41:01] <indig0bird> It hurts the fucking servers!
[3:41:08] <indig0bird> How is that hard to understand?
[3:41:13] <T_Sasquatch> some how many other countries dont have this problem 🤔 i wonder why
[3:41:14] <%bevyrage> not tipping doesn't /directly/ hurt the business
[3:41:18] <Run44forrest> people that complain about not getting more than 20% on social media are gross
[3:41:21] <%PlainSimpleTailor> You should tip the Chef, not the person who walked maximum 15 feet to bring the food
[3:41:26] <%connos_livereview> i wish my eyes would get stronger
[3:41:30] <%mitchteck> I always tip 20% no matter how bad my service is
[3:41:45] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> It super sucks when people need tips, like it's not a bonus it's needed to pay rent
[3:41:45] <%El_Desperad0> BibleThump
[3:41:52] <%ThDark> I mean I work at a coffee/tea shop, so I make all the products I serve
[3:42:13] <%bevyrage> it wouldn't be an issue if the tips /were/ a bonus though
[3:42:16] <alrobot2014> SHOVEL KNIGHT?!

[3:47:34] <%lewdskeletor13> FAST THINGS DONT BREAK STUFF duh
[3:47:35] <Ion_Laser> F = M * A

[3:47:57] <%NWR_James> It'd be like being hit by the most powerful gun ever
[3:47:58] <Neo_Kaiser> Hyperspace in Star Wars is a different dimension
[3:48:00] <%Jibbleheimer> Jibbleheimer subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:48:01] <%QueequegTheater> Momentum is mass times velocity squared
[3:48:01] <$cureneckbeard> I just got back, is Pat explaining Second Impact

[3:48:05] <+HeadsHeldHigh> NEVER STOP
[3:48:06] <MasterDecoder> @hntronium because it's not viable all the time
[3:48:08] <%Nomad_Scholar> infinite mass punch
[3:48:08] <%lewdskeletor13> This is the dumbest nitpick ever jesus
[3:48:12] <frozenottsel> Deja Vu
[3:48:12] <Run44forrest> 1
[3:48:13] <+HeadsHeldHigh> NEVER STOP GOING IN
[3:48:13] <SchroedingersFerret> I majored in physics please stop
[3:48:14] <+Ell1ot> then why didn't they just hyperspeed a bunch of ships at the death stars?
[3:48:14] <mor3gan> 1 big truck hitting tiny car, both vehicles apply same force against eachother
[3:48:15] <%El_Desperad0> 3
[3:48:17] <%fragdar> if you take a ship in light speed, and point to a planet can you blow it up?
[3:48:17] <%MelBrooksKA> f=ma means that mass is a completely different thing...
[3:48:19] <Run44forrest> everyones wrong
[3:48:20] <%starotter70> yes
[3:48:22] <%starotter70> what
[3:48:25] <%gazingeye1> herperspace is a seperae dimension! mass shouldnt interact!
[3:48:25] <%connos_livereview> eh star wars is fantasy magic bullshit anyway
[3:48:26] <%hntronium> @MasterDecoder It would've been viable against the Death Star
[3:48:27] <%crimsonharvest> If you want to read a funny book about stupid physics, pick up What If by Randal Munroe
[3:48:29] <%SaltyDongs> 3 2 1
[3:48:29] <%nmaten> also theres theories that at the speed of light you would need to have no mass and therefore not interact with anything
[3:48:32] <%brickwall35> a car made of diamonds hits a brick wall...
[3:48:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> But it's not supposed to be a projectile that hits the target really hard
[3:48:36] <%lewdskeletor13> WHO CARES
[3:48:37] <$SGrim> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN rooREE
[3:48:39] <%nmaten> kinda like what happens in cowboy bebop
[3:48:39] <Run44forrest> physics dumb itd just math but worse
[3:48:39] <%QueequegTheater> @fragdar With a super star destroyer, maybe
[3:48:41] <+Mittensbro> no pat the problem is that suddenly it creates the question of WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE DO THIS
[3:48:43] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> So twerking means super nice fast fat ass?
[3:48:43] <%hntronium> Pat how is that ridiculous
[3:48:45] <T_Sasquatch> im more bothered by fucking princess leia space jesus
[3:48:47] <indig0bird> There were clearly pieces of ship crushing into other ships
[3:48:47] <Neo_Kaiser> If hyperspace is just going fast then how can anybody travel anywhere when there's millions of planets, asteroids and stars betwen them?
[3:48:48] <mor3gan> Bullets just go
[3:48:50] <%Jibbleheimer> @AngriestPat Thanks for getting me into the Yakuza series. The whole thing is a crazy ride.
[3:48:53] <hussdogrob> Pat go to sleep chat is trying to melt your brain
[3:48:58] <+RushUnplugged> no Pat, pissbaby has to keep whining about TLJ after 2 years, it's important
[3:48:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Whine about your baby complaints somewhere else
[3:48:59] <gustavozxd> we're talking about a movie with space wizards
[3:49:06] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 was gonna be like shantae pirates curse, or EBF5 or something. Had a few games you could have chosen from for a 1 off
[3:49:08] <%Mekhet09> it was at e3
[3:49:09] <+Ell1ot> Hyperspeeding your ship into things seems to solve a lot of problems
[3:49:12] <%connos_livereview> puppeteer of the penis
[3:49:16] <%QueequegTheater> TLJ was good, not perfect, but good
[3:49:17] <T_Sasquatch> this doesnt make sense in my movie about LIGHTSABERS
[3:49:28] <%fragdar> @QueequegTheater the empire is missing big time making those balls with lasers then
[3:49:29] <%Laecerelius> EDF5
[3:49:31] <%cvp5127> shantae 5 hype
[3:49:33] <T_Sasquatch> and the "FORCE"
[3:49:34] <%ace_cfa44> probably EDF 5
[3:49:35] <$SGrim> "Like getting hit by a bullet going 1000 times faster than a bullet that was the size of a island." rooBlank
[3:49:39] <%Toynota10> I think he means Earth Defense Force 5
[3:49:40] <%gazingeye1> if hyperspace isnt a seperate dimension everyone should be riddled with holes from micro-asteroids!
[3:49:40] <%El_Desperad0> YEYEY
[3:49:41] <Kirby_Sauce> Epic battle fantasy. Rpg
[3:49:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> But a single projectile doesn't mean it will automatically destroy adjacent ships in a radius around the trajectory
[3:49:44] <%connos_livereview> earth befence force
