[0:00:17] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 26m.
[0:00:20] <%fallen92x> yis
[0:00:21] <%DirtyGaijin> yeah paige having the big lupus?
[0:00:22] <+Sigmatub> Oh jeez
[0:00:25] <%Ion_Laser> @the_sorrow_ LEWD
[0:00:30] <+JayEarly> What a fucking ending
[0:00:33] <DonatelloJose> Paige is busy being a Ninetails
[0:00:33] <redrins> @The_Sorrow_ now now don't kink shame
[0:00:35] <DingusMcBaseball> whats this song on the brb?
[0:00:37] <MrNoobMcSalt> I just got here happened
[0:00:38] <Saturdaythe14th> So now I'll say again to anybody playing DMC5, I really recommend getting max gunslinger because of double kalina ann
[0:00:40] <The_Sorrow_> not in like a sex way DansGame
[0:00:42] <%the_devil_breaker> STANDO. Crazy Talk - ruoiding hio
[0:00:43] <+Sigmatub> Like is it full on right now?
[0:00:43] <helpmeimafruit> Vergil is such a fucking dork I want to shove him in a locker
[0:00:43] <Cameony> While Pat's busy, can anyone tell me if there's a decent weapon other than the Ludwig's holy blade and the blade of mercy?
[0:00:45] <aimlesshealer> Paige had an allergic reaction to the fire stone
[0:00:46] <%CerberusDriver> that Vergil boss was basically Vergil 2 mixed with DmC Vergil but if DmC Vergil wasn't fucking lame.
[0:00:47] <Saturdaythe14th> because shooting vergil in the face with a laser cannon until he dies is hilarious
[0:00:48] <%vincerocmm> apatBig apatPorgmo
[0:01:03] <%VioletHeart> @Cameony I don't think there's a bad weapon in that game so
[0:01:03] <mastermidget23> Is it bad that every time Paige is sick and he goes to check on her, I kind of low-key worried she's just dead?
[0:01:04] <42nfl19> so how do you unlock the gum taunt? want to make sure I don't miss it for my unlock
[0:01:13] <+JayEarly> @saturdaythe14th hell even Ebony and Ivory are fun to use now with Gunslinger
[0:01:20] <Cameony> is the stake driver any good?
[0:01:24] <EVA_Unit02> This sounds like a SMT IV track? Where is this from?

[0:01:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 27m.
[0:01:29] <Artista_AF> i swear PeePee keeps getting closer the more you look
[0:01:29] <%VioletHeart> It's tough to use but I enjoy it.
[0:01:30] <helpmeimafruit> so dante saying "not in a million years" after vergil uses doppelganger is 100% a nod to DmC, right?
[0:01:32] <%VioletHeart> Very close range.
[0:01:33] <masso101> @42nfl19 beat neros credits sequence
[0:01:35] <KaptainKappathe5th> hi dad
[0:01:36] <DonatelloJose> @mastermidget23 that would make for a ROUGH fucking stream
[0:01:37] <Dragon_Batman> Hey again
[0:01:39] <+Mace_Dragon> GS Faust is great crowd control too
[0:01:39] <Saturdaythe14th> gunslinger is great now, but mega cascade is great because vergil can't deflect it
[0:01:39] <%VioletHeart> More like a dagger than a pile bunker.
[0:01:40] <person181> that WAS fast
[0:01:42] <indig0bird> Is Paige ok?

[0:08:10] <Artista_AF> Dante is not a Gay Cowboy, just a cowboy afraid of responsibility LUL
[0:08:10] <mastermidget23> That seems like something Trish might just say to be, uh, Trish.
[0:08:13] <Make_me_mad> If anything she means she's implying she fucked Nero.
[0:08:14] <%SergeEXE> Virgil doesn't even REMEMBER that he fucks

[0:08:21] <%El_Desperad0> It does?
[0:08:21] <%DirtyGaijin> Dante's purity must be persevered
[0:08:22] <%kiiiirsten> @T_Sasquatch he does in my 405 page fanfiction
[0:08:26] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Dante screams "M-Mother" as he blows inside
[0:08:27] <blackbookalpha> Did Vergil fuck a GOD?
[0:08:28] <dukenux> G-GRANDMA
[0:08:29] <%rubbishbinge> Man, I can't believe Gilver is canon now.
[0:08:31] <+Silentman0> @AngriestPat they just announced a netflix dragon's dogma anime
[0:08:34] <Saturdaythe14th> Yeah, if you bash vergil into his ghost the lyrics start playing

[0:09:44] <%Tarcanist_> I'M SINGING IN THE RAIN, JUST SINGING IN THE RAIN! WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELING, I'M HAPPY AGAIN! pat
[0:09:45] <%rubbishbinge> @D4C_Trice Gilver was Vergil in the DMC1 prequel novel. He was the one who killed Nell, with a gun no less.
[0:09:46] <TheyCallMeVawn> Its funny how Dante is trying to take something from Vergil in V while Vergil was trying to take something from Dante in 3
[0:09:52] <$valriot> SCHUM
[0:09:52] <KaptainKappathe5th> PLAYABLE VIRGIL
[0:09:54] <%nitronLVIII> PLAYABLE
[0:09:54] <Tha_Mik> I slowly pull your devil trigger
[0:09:56] <Saturdaythe14th> @AngriestPat Did you see the kill animation V has against Vergil, since you saw modded and datamined stuff?
[0:09:57] <%hntronium> VERGIL CHARACTER when
[0:09:59] <TranquilTurnip> Suspiciously complete
[0:10:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hmmmmm
[0:10:03] <SnaKemuho> like he always did?
[0:10:04] <42nfl19> hmmm
[0:10:05] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> There's already gameplay of people using him.
[0:10:07] <%Klefth> That has always been the case
[0:10:09] <indig0bird> Probably not tweaked for that
[0:10:10] <dekkitout> No way
[0:10:10] <RantingRavager> @AngriestPat have you seen the custom animation that V has when he's fighting Nero?
[0:10:11] <%Halowood> He seems p limited to me compared to 4SE Vergil
[0:10:11] <%sshen> Isn't it his 4SE moveset
[0:10:11] <%Solidus_113> He has all his moves from 4SE
[0:10:14] <%TheFilth> Robust
[0:10:18] <person181> thoughts waking though my head
[0:10:19] <KaptainKappathe5th> YEYEYEYE
[0:10:20] <Dragon_Batman> Hah

[0:10:27] <%AkronymCLT> Fun Fact, if you look at rebellion's model you can see that it's made from damascus steel
[0:10:27] <$D4C_Trice> he has his DMC3 costume too
[0:10:28] <T_Sasquatch> if dragons dogma is getting an anime then dragons dogma 2 is fucking happening
[0:10:28] <dekkitout> Something something mod?
[0:10:28] <benjiFG> maybe they're in the higher difficulties

[0:10:37] <Artista_AF> Vergil becoming playable? what a fucking shock! i could NEVER have seen it coming Kappa
[0:10:37] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat Vergil does air combos in SoS
[0:10:40] <rosemon5001> ahhaha
[0:10:40] <$Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 turn the sound up pat. If it's too loud, we can turn it down, but as it stands I can barely hear you. I've had a bad day at school today, and I need to lessen my constant suffering with your nonsense. Can't do that if I can't hear you.

[0:10:53] <%starotter70> Great
[0:10:53] <+ZingAmazing> V has a special finish against Vergil, so you will probably fight himin the palace
[0:10:54] <+decisivelynameless> Pat, the Vergil that you can swap in is actually super broken and barely works.
[0:10:54] <+DeniedPants> Is that really a surprise though?
[0:10:54] <%TheFilth> When Capgod
[0:10:56] <lizard0tm> @AngriestPat So... playing as Virgil tonight?

[0:11:05] <CptBritches> @AngriestPat Are you excited to see how they use V's gameplay as a summoner character in Dragon's Dogma 2?
[0:11:05] <+Polter_ge1st> Pat when will you be playable in Bloody Palace?

[0:35:44] <ravencloak13> Now they need to somehow let you play that version of the game with the live action mocap guys. That be next level bullshit fun.

[0:37:52] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Oh! They flipped the scene and cameras at the end for better continuity! Niiiice.
[0:37:53] <rosabellamelantha> @AngriestPat I actually kinda dislike this because that means you need to double exceed and ALSO charge your gun constantly I just can't stand it
[0:37:56] <irfan_> How does DT Tomboy work?
[0:37:57] <OrochiSheewa> crew cut was yelling for her let him go
[0:37:57] <suikudo> Not feeling the japanese voice acting
[0:38:01] <ravencloak13> Wow, that fucking grab goes far.
[0:38:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nero's full moveset looks pretty rad
[0:38:09] <%hntronium> Japanese Nico 10/10

[0:39:48] <Darkrenai> @AngriestPat You so need to show Paige the pre viz cutscenes, she would love how stupid fun they are
[0:39:51] <%DirtyGaijin> Im having a breakdown thinking about he Hat scene with these cinematics
[0:39:51] <reonome> the ending
[0:39:56] <+GoldySUP> Nero is 100% the most fun character to play
[0:39:59] <+ahdurian> @SGrim the best live action cutscene
[0:40:03] <aimlesshealer> Pat's rating of DMC5: shitzillion/10
[0:40:04] <spire6> @SGrim top quality cutscenes
[0:40:06] <SnaKemuho> btw there was a scene in the trailer where Dante rode Cavaliere on this bridge, and it's not in the game
[0:40:07] <Tucker0603> Nero is the fucking best
[0:40:10] <AlasterAngelo> @GoldySUP he's super fun but Dante's still top
[0:40:12] <ravencloak13> Actually for any aspiring movie directors the Dev Cutscenes would probably be nice to look at as reference.
[0:40:12] <stirlingw17> tom boy is a weird one to me I don't know if I like it
[0:40:17] <+Punisher7771> i though the has his arme ack?

[0:53:25] <MeowmereArt> @KaptainKappathe5th pretty sure his human arm is devil bringer, cause he can make it go away when he put on devil breaker. So at least its not just solid human normal arm.
[0:53:27] <+AxeassinChris> Damn, did he finish the story?
[0:53:28] <%DirtyGaijin> back down king

[0:54:08] <PrinceOfEden> @iwishthiswasicq Oh that's fucking cool, I guess I pulled it off trying to grab someone immediately after an attack.
[0:54:08] <Spiderfacev> @AngriestPat is DMC4 Charge Shot similar to color up? Just hold the gun button?
[0:54:09] <%HyperCharge_Sam> no cutscene here apparently
[0:54:11] <KaptainKappathe5th> @MeowmereArt true, but its still a fact that nero has a human arm and vergil still gets yamato

[0:57:42] <%masneo2> live action cutscenes are great
[0:57:43] <%TheMattman1313> Doesn't Vergil's ass stay with Urizen and is nonexistent on V?
[0:57:47] <%DirtyGaijin> I want these guys as in game models now please

[0:58:17] <CptBritches> Starring: Elmo
[0:58:19] <$DeaDHer015> bug key?
[0:58:23] <stirlingw17> is V just Vergil's turd in the wind?

[0:58:30] <T_Sasquatch> yes
[0:58:32] <dero45> Elmo being a cat
[0:58:34] <InugamiTheHound> id dente makes out with V? Does that make it incest?
[0:58:36] <ArbysLiker1969> it still has the super
[0:58:37] <b_ikki> except it does a million more damage
[0:58:37] <%El_Desperad0> yup
[0:58:38] <T_Sasquatch> i didnt expect you to get it back
[0:58:44] <nox_nyctores> Buster arm does more damage, ideal for bosses
[0:58:44] <%fattness132> Buster arm does double damage of your non-arm buster
[0:58:44] <%gnarly_memes_bro> GEE NICO 2 BUSTERs?
[0:58:46] <%ThePuddingDead> that is the most wrong you ever are for this game Pat
[0:58:46] <Someguy893> but it has real impact
[0:58:48] <+DeRedBaron> it feels like the idea of you even getting it back was like a no way
[0:58:49] <SnaKemuho> @angriestpat charged Buster does more damage
[0:58:49] <Dragon_Batman> I'm shure it's that and a here you go for the time being
[0:58:50] <PrinceOfEden> It does more damage. @AngriestPat
[0:58:51] <FuqBoiSlim> Buster arm does like twice the damage though
[0:58:52] <mechslayer71> It becomes completely worthless, great fake out LUL
[0:58:53] <LozsCat> It does more damage pat
[0:58:54] <%DirtyGaijin> Nico Nico buster
[0:58:55] <Nobuwaroo> the break age is good though
[0:58:55] <+CCCPKi> Its exceeded form auto-grapples un-staggered enemies and does far more damage @AngriestPat
[0:58:58] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat pretty sure it was so people thought you wouldn't get your buster back
[0:58:59] <koolkid1208> @AngriestPat Did you see the Sekiro Launch trailer
[0:59:01] <jinking79> well fully charged it a DT buster
[0:59:01] <kouhi12> it does more damage than his normal buster
[0:59:11] <+ZealStar> Buster does like more than double the damage and yo ucan't be interrupted in the break age. Saves you on DMD
[0:59:14] <yuribo26> Hey chat, what difficulty is he on?
[0:59:19] <%gnarly_memes_bro> SoS

[0:59:25] <gogoszy> Charge shot 3 is godlike, as ususal
[0:59:25] <aimlesshealer> Yay hood
[0:59:29] <+Punisher7771> @AngriestPat whats the diffrane between gp01 and regular?
[0:59:35] <CptBritches> We in da hood now
[0:59:43] <dero45> Hood engaged
[0:59:49] <Russelnotscp> is he saying "bingo" or "begone?"
[0:59:51] <+DeRedBaron> it launches you in teh air instead of shooting out front
[0:59:53] <squidpeanut> Because it just would make anti spoiler budgeting look like buster
[0:59:54] <yuribo26> Charget shot 3 is obscene
[0:59:56] <PrinceOfEden> Begone
[0:59:59] <T_Sasquatch> @Russelnotscp begoneee
[1:00:00] <FenixSeraph> Begone
[1:00:02] <%The_Esquana> @Russelnotscp begone
[1:00:04] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Physalis Arm goes up/ down
[1:00:07] <Shooterboy23> They nerfed Charge shot 3 from being fuck busted in 4 to just being busted in 5.
[1:00:10] <benjiFG> robotic trick up
[1:00:13] <%Dr_FoxWolf> Buster arm is stronger than your bringer btw
[1:00:14] <+TheoTTree> fuck you no it isn't
[1:00:16] <stirlingw17> it's down trick though
[1:00:17] <yuribo26> I prefer GP01 all the way
[1:00:18] <AlasterAngelo> ehhhhh
[1:00:18] <gottigotbundles> wait is he actually getting those revs on every swing?
[1:00:19] <ZaibatsuFan> But that looks cooler
[1:00:19] <b_ikki> hell no
[1:00:20] <+TheoTTree> >:(
[1:00:21] <gogoszy> Thought it was just cosmetic.
[1:00:24] <CptBritches> Pat wrong as usual
[1:00:24] <FenixSeraph> gotta get that Gundam 0083 reference in somehow
[1:00:31] <+TheoTTree> GP-01 feels so much nicer
[1:00:32] <Shooterboy23> the dlc gerbera is better if you're creative enough to actually do COMBO but hey do you i guess
[1:00:37] <T_Sasquatch> its literally not better LUL, it has more moves
[1:00:37] <Tucker0603> I kinda like GB01 more though
[1:00:39] <CptBritches> Buster arm is WAY stronger
[1:00:39] <stirlingw17> @yuribo26 same
[1:00:42] <ArbysLiker1969> I was kinda hoping charge shot wouldn't come back
[1:00:42] <+CuteKitkat> im having such a hard time at SoS Cerberus rn
[1:00:46] <aimlesshealer> noooo
[1:00:46] <%SpcOpsBear> @AngriestPat You ever think of getting a controller with paddles instead of having to remap your buttons?
[1:00:48] <+BaronEgo> buster arm is stronger and uninterruptible
[1:00:49] <MeowmereArt> LMFAO
[1:00:49] <AlasterAngelo> hahahaha
[1:00:49] <yuribo26> EAT SHIT LUL
[1:00:51] <mayorrev> pat pls
[1:00:52] <theobble> what about dendrobium
[1:00:55] <CptBritches> Lmao

[1:01:00] <ShreddingPixels> Raw
[1:01:00] <shinbuya> wow wat those wings
[1:01:01] <RantingRavager> wait, imaginary yamato?
[1:01:01] <KaptainKappathe5th> YO THAT WAS THE YAMATO
[1:01:03] <Dragon_Batman> That broke the floor dam
[1:01:03] <%Ion_Laser> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:01:03] <benjiFG> nice
[1:01:05] <cavefishes> SUUPER SEXY
[1:01:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wait, I missed something. why yamato
[1:01:11] <%ThePuddingDead> we know you tried pat
[1:01:14] <+Parrish_broadnax> Tried to be like DADDy
[1:01:14] <Fujisaki_Chihiro> yeah the buster arm has much higher damage potential due to the charged grab
[1:01:16] <Shraquet> Which announcer is that? He sounds like Lupin III.
[1:01:17] <aimlesshealer> and then you did do it good, and it was good
[1:01:17] <SnaKemuho> so it actually has 1 armor hit now
[1:01:19] <CptBritches> That's what we expect
[1:01:19] <Shooterboy23> yeah that move makes no sense in this game
[1:01:21] <Tucker0603> WHAT?!? ETHEREAL YaMATO,?
[1:01:22] <gogoszy> You'll do it good at some point.
[1:01:23] <%DirtyGaijin> imaginary Yamato just like his absent dad
[1:01:23] <+JavaManJoJo> I messed around with Buster in the void and I don't remember the exact numbers but it did around 1000 damage where the other one does a couple hundred or something
[1:01:24] <%gnarly_memes_bro> O i guess the floor can break there
[1:01:25] <thebehatted> you can change the ranking announcer?
[1:01:26] <%Trinity5> @shraquet its nico
[1:01:27] <Zerud> is this on SoS or DMD?
[1:01:27] <dero45> That’ll do pat
[1:01:27] <Megapikman132> @Shraquet it's Nico
[1:01:28] <%alexandrecau> It's not yamato but like the other he can make sword on DT
[1:01:30] <b_ikki> base buster arm grab also does a ton more damage than regular buster
[1:01:32] <%SpcOpsBear> SoS
[1:01:34] <+sweetnesss688> sipsipHellmo
[1:01:37] <dking0000> Can you still do the new Blue Rose stuff when you unlock the old stuff?

[1:02:06] <jessicaamado> !uptime
[1:02:07] <foxhounder29> hypothetically speaking, Nero's devil trigger in 4 is not really a devil trigger. it's just him using yamato's power.
[1:02:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 28m.
[1:02:07] <RantingRavager> can elmo do a stinger?

[1:02:10] <ZaibatsuFan> ELMO WILL DESTROY YOU
[1:02:11] <Fujisaki_Chihiro> There's a video of someone practically one shooting the final boss by staggering him, hitting him with 4 overture charges, and then a charged buster arm
[1:02:13] <Dehlome> if you could summon any sword why not the yamato?
[1:02:15] <gottigotbundles> vergil, sparda, Lucia need to be playable

[1:06:50] <shinbuya> his face a droopy vagina ?
[1:06:50] <ZaibatsuFan> LMAO
[1:06:50] <%pogodick> Schtick Hydro Dick Bot
[1:06:51] <SnaKemuho> @kevarjo555 some cutscenes don't have live versions sadly
[1:06:52] <ChoculaUltra> is 8 segments the max dt gauge?
[1:06:54] <gustavozxd> this enemy is fun to fight, clash with their blades and fuck em up
[1:06:57] <ZaibatsuFan> That was awesome
[1:06:58] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Use Nero's DT more, it builds super fast
[1:06:58] <b_ikki> @AngriestPat if you want to bully them buster ignores their armor
[1:07:05] <%iwishthiswasicq> Doing Break Away with Punch Line out does PHAT damage.
[1:07:12] <PrinceOfEden> I skip unnecessary fights when I'm confident that I'll still get an S rank
[1:07:14] <%Trinity5> @monstersdogma learn the royal guard timings to stock up DT if you're getting rocked
[1:07:15] <PrinceOfEden> This is one of them
[1:07:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Trinity5 Never owned a game, played 1 and 3 for about an hour at a friend's before. I need a PS4 :(
[1:07:18] <Sedrelic> next game nero with sdt
[1:07:23] <%ThePuddingDead> how do you NOT know this?
[1:07:29] <%hawk_rush> yep
[1:07:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> yeah you explode the rocket
[1:07:36] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> That Rocket Arm comboing enemies is the fucking funniest thing I've seen all year!
[1:07:38] <%GurrenPrime> have you not use helter skelter with buster yet Pat?
[1:07:39] <$cureneckbeard> put the headcrab in the big vagina
[1:07:39] <yuribo26> @AngriestPat you can skip nidghogg hatchlings animation by pressing start
[1:07:42] <gustavozxd> look at Nero's dialogue and look at the next arm to show u- oh yeah this is on SoS
[1:07:45] <%hawk_rush> breakaway ups your style
[1:07:45] <%Trinity5> @sphincter_spelunker lol have you watched the entire playthrough with Pat?
[1:07:45] <Dragon_Batman> It does more if you break away punch line while in rocket mode I'm shure
[1:07:47] <Turbocommand> Hey Pat, why did Woolie release like a bizillion episodes of DMC
[1:07:49] <+wolfdude_120> Yeah, Punchline breakaway is tight
[1:07:50] <%iwishthiswasicq> It blows up Punchline and it does big damage.
[1:07:51] <nox_nyctores> @AngriestPat what's your controller configuration after Nero gets his DT? Still trying new configurations
[1:07:54] <stirlingw17> punch line when fired can be broken and do some ok damage
[1:07:58] <%DirtyGaijin> its time for quality content
[1:07:58] <gustavozxd> Nero says this arm is pretty sweet and sweet surrender shows up
[1:07:59] <SnaKemuho> consider it an AOE charge
[1:08:00] <%Rngiddion> awwww
[1:08:01] <b_ikki> do a skateboard trick through the people's ashes

[1:08:09] <%ArcanumMBD> this isn't live action. time to refund the game
[1:08:10] <%alexandrecau> you can break away to get out of a grab or being surrounded
[1:08:12] <%GurrenPrime> @turbocommand wanted to try a different lp style and comments bitching
[1:08:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Trinity5 Of course. Not completely lost.
[1:08:14] <$MightyMaxT> @AngriestPat So, going through the gallery, there is art for Vergil's DT Version 1, Is that a part of the boss fight that I have missed or did it not get added?
[1:08:17] <+KevarJo555> bad scene BibleThump

[1:08:31] <mayorrev> eww what are these hideous computer graphics
[1:08:31] <%ThePuddingDead> it helps the gun doesnt act like it did in 4
[1:08:32] <+TheStarvingGood> is there any difference between using devil breaker or bringer when pulling enemies towards you?
[1:08:32] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat do you use default V controls or did you move Griffon to R2?
[1:08:33] <JT137> Square BUSTER

[1:08:43] <%Trinity5> @sphincter_spelunker nah I'm just wondering if the interest held out past the first stream. good to hear!

[1:12:24] <+JonnyCue> That arm reminds me of half of The End Of The World
[1:12:27] <Make_me_mad> @AngriestPat If you throw him at that tower it collapses on top of him.
[1:12:28] <%budyd> good night my dude, got a midterm tomorrow, send me some luck.
[1:12:29] <MeowmereArt> Nero is such a goofball
[1:12:31] <danknugglit> I remember this bowser fight
[1:12:32] <$XeroSigmaPrime> @SnaKemuho Not true dude, you gotta play and experiment with this game more. There's some ridiculous shit you can do with the bosses
[1:12:33] <azamitomo> So apparently Knuckle can also be activated when you get hit by an enemies attack.
[1:12:35] <Zerud> does it cause more damage if you throw at a building?
[1:12:39] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat THROW HIM INTO THE TOWER

[1:13:22] <danknugglit> You gotta throw him into the bombs not off the side
[1:13:25] <yuribo26> @omegasis all bosses have an animation like that, where you buster them while they are stunned
[1:13:26] <InugamiTheHound> jerk off the demon with your jack hand
[1:13:27] <AlasterAngelo> i dont even know what sweet surrender does

[1:14:05] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat There's a unique animation if you throw him into the tower
[1:14:18] <$XeroSigmaPrime> @SnaKemuho no they don't. They have even sicker shit you can do like throwing Artemis thru the roof or grabbing her with nightmare

[1:21:57] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat what buster is your favorite so far
[1:21:58] <+Personified134> why does she not have lines for D and C?
[1:21:59] <Shooterboy23> I noticed that too because i used it alot as Dante in 4
[1:22:02] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat did you hear about the dragons dogma anime?
[1:22:04] <CptBritches> There's so many small things in this game

[1:22:48] <%ThePuddingDead> agreed
[1:22:50] <thebehatted> is there still a point to buster arm?

[1:23:02] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat how to you set it so the middle button is the taunt instead of the small share button?
[1:23:02] <Zerud> Can you get hit in the middle of a buster animation with R2? Like when you do with buster arm?
[1:23:03] <+EvilSoully> So does Buster Arm do more damage than the actual Buster?
[1:23:05] <%ThePuddingDead> its like turrets in FF XIV...no fuckin point

[1:23:11] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @EvilSoully yes
[1:23:17] <+teg88> Buster Arm hits WAY harder
[1:23:18] <%AncelDeLambert> this is the mega-elixir argument all over again
[1:23:19] <+Spinningrobo> dont let that man upstage you
[1:23:19] <Jermatoo> @sappinmahbinyot Yeah, a friend of mine got super spoiled on Nero getting DT on his first playthrough of mission 7. :(
[1:23:19] <sappinmahbinyot> @AlertDOTEXE yes
[1:23:20] <+Konquerer> you have the same layout as me somehow, i hate it
[1:23:32] <AlertDOTEXE> thanks
[1:23:32] <%lloyddboy> DUMBASS
[1:23:33] <SnaKemuho> dumbass
[1:23:37] <Covil91> The buster execution doesn't use gun charge. Sad.
[1:23:37] <Hellarussian> BIG combo drop
[1:23:38] <+mugwugsampoo> LUL
[1:23:40] <PrinceOfEden> Red Knight is showing off with his double SS LUL
[1:23:41] <b_ikki> look at how better red knight is doing
[1:23:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I am currently jump cancelling knuckle into itself to ORAORAORA people to death in the air without ever touching them with not knuckle on the default control
[1:23:49] <+tigerfang86> OWNED
[1:23:51] <Megapikman132> DT
[1:23:56] <%mostundesired> Did the chorus just start over or am I nuts?
[1:23:59] <shinbuya> EW
[1:24:01] <+Punisher7771> red knight is out styllin you pat
[1:24:04] <ZaibatsuFan> So the custom cutscenes are paid content only?
[1:24:05] <sappinmahbinyot> @Jermatoo well I mean nero's theme songis called devil trigger so oit's no surprise. But knowing that he gets his buster back is a pretty big deal.
[1:24:12] <+sweetnesss688> woah
[1:24:12] <SnaKemuho> imo Buster Arm's claws also look better
[1:24:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @mostundesired It's rank related
[1:24:13] <+tigerfang86> SICK
[1:24:13] <%AncelDeLambert> PILEDRIVER!!
[1:24:14] <%Typhaeon> Powerbomb!
[1:24:16] <masso101> Pat do you have any advice for using shadow and griffon at the same time?
[1:24:18] <Shooterboy23> @mostundesired The music is dynamic. Changes based on rank.
[1:24:18] <Ner234> @AngriestPat have you ever used a buster attack on a Fury (The super fast enemy) ? It's hype.
[1:24:22] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat how do you make taunt the big middle button?
[1:24:22] <%mostundesired> Neat
[1:24:25] <b_ikki> :)
[1:24:27] <JT137> they dont rage after a buster knock down
[1:24:28] <+TunyNinja> @AngriestPat What did they say?
[1:24:33] <StrangeCoincidence> Believe in your own justice
[1:24:39] <TheWildVlad> can you use two different busters without losing style, or are they considered the same move?
[1:24:42] <b_ikki> to buster the cleaver dudes when they have armor
[1:24:49] <+omegasis> why not put griffin in trigger?
[1:24:50] <ZaibatsuFan> You have to pay extra for the custom cutscenes, right?
[1:24:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat have you read the the Reviews for DMCV yet...Have you seen the Scrubery
[1:24:51] <T_Sasquatch> holy shit i missed aall those rorbs
[1:24:58] <dsauce999> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[1:25:03] <Covil91> Just put Griffin on L2. Two handed controls
[1:25:05] <+Konquerer> i put griffon and shadow on both triggers
[1:25:10] <rosemon5001> you purpously left that 1 pile of robrs huh?
[1:25:13] <PrinceOfEden> Starring DEVIL MAY CRY ITSELF
[1:25:14] <AnEnemyStandu> how do you get ps4 icons
[1:25:14] <+EvilSoully> @AngriestPat I know its still early days, but how do you rate this game compared to the rest of the series? You seem to quite like it
[1:25:15] <televisedrevolting> How do you feel about making the summons the triggers?
[1:25:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Pookiedaexzile The bingo card was spot on.
[1:25:17] <Pistachius> so is V related to Bayonetta in any way?
[1:25:19] <SnaKemuho> I put Griffon on R2 and book on L2, so it's kinda like Nero
[1:25:20] <Jermatoo> @AngriestPat What are your thoughts on V getting his own prequel manga?
[1:25:24] <JT137> nani
[1:25:27] <alwayspronking> WutFace
[1:25:30] <$ooblagis> Griffon on L1 works
[1:25:30] <suikudo> Why does V-sync cause god awful controller input lag on almost every game?
[1:25:34] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat someone made a template you can st your controller too in steam big picture mode, just one click and taunt goes to the touch pad
[1:25:36] <krksobk> devilish
[1:25:39] <Pookiedaexzile> @Sphincter_Spelunker It got filled in with in the day
[1:25:44] <Morning_Asakura> triggers seem great
[1:25:44] <%gnarly_memes_bro> do you people hat your wrists?
[1:25:45] <Kostas1001> @AngriestPat did you hear that Capcom leaked a Denuvo-less .exe that improves performance?
[1:25:45] <%Trinity5> I just put every gun/ranged thing on r2
[1:25:47] <+Konquerer> it's working for me on DMD
[1:25:50] <+tigerfang86> I wish V stayed around SOMEHOW
[1:25:51] <JT137> V has come to
[1:25:52] <%Trinity5> every melee on triangle
[1:25:53] <+Silentman0> griffon is just the gun, of course i put it on the trigger
[1:25:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[1:25:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 52m.
[1:25:53] <+tigerfang86> he's really fun
[1:25:56] <%GurrenPrime> a guy I know who streams plays on stick
[1:25:56] <%lloyddboy> where does V GET HIS CLOTHES
[1:25:57] <T_Sasquatch> i have attacks , and devil breakers on triggers LUL
[1:25:58] <+tigerfang86> as like a character
[1:26:00] <Shooterboy23> Putting guns on R2 and L2 is so straining on my wrists so i put them on L1
[1:26:00] <%GurrenPrime> dudes fucking crazy
[1:26:11] <Covil91> I want foot pedals to play dmc so I have 2 more limbs to use.
[1:26:12] <RangerJ95> Do you hope we see a return of V's moveset in a sequel?
[1:26:15] <%El_Desperad0> I hope we get a character like V in the next DMC
[1:26:17] <%Chatterbox1991> @AngriestPat What do you feel about a DMC6 where Nero gets his own rival character like Dante had wity Vergil?
[1:26:17] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat do you think theres any possibility of V somehow returning in a future entry despite the fact that he got reabsorbed and his familiars got punked?
[1:26:17] <televisedrevolting> Pat talk about V's prequel again.
[1:26:19] <%alexandrecau> V's book become the new V. like demon essence make it alive
[1:26:21] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I used to have Griffon on right trigger, but it was too awkward so I made him triangle and Shadow square
[1:26:21] <+thepinkestcatgirl> "V"-sync
[1:26:21] <%Typhaeon> apatBig processing
[1:26:26] <Pookiedaexzile> SPOILERS: Isn't it implied that V was in on it the whole time
[1:26:26] <Jermatoo> @lloyddboy That's mentioned in the prequel novel, he uses griffon to literally rob and kill people for free shit LUL
[1:26:29] <%Shadowthedigger> You were saying about V Pat?
[1:26:30] <InugamiTheHound> has pat gotten the hidden taunt move yet?
[1:26:33] <%lloyddboy> NICE
[1:26:39] <%mitchteck> @angriestpat do you think trish will get a new weapon in the dlc because Sparta is gone?
[1:26:40] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Fuck Denuvo
[1:26:44] <dsauce999> @AngriestPat what about that new dragon's dogma...anime?
[1:26:53] <%Kravedarknesss> What if they tried to integrate V's moves into Virgil"s
[1:26:53] <sarg1010> Do you think you'll ever get tired of hearing the Red Queen rev up? Cause I know I won't.
[1:26:54] <JackalKing> Denuvo keeps insisting it doesn't impact performance at all. And yet every time something like this happens performance magically improves.
[1:26:55] <%masneo2> is there an achievement for those photos?
[1:26:56] <nox_nyctores> Starring Devil May Cry from the Devil May Cry series
[1:26:58] <CptBritches> V will serve as a basis gampley wise for a summoner type character in Dragon's Dogma 2
[1:26:58] <Sedrelic> that guy who uploaded the firts exe cost capcom a fuck ton of money
[1:27:01] <+EvilSoully> I dont think its possiblee to get tired of this song
[1:27:05] <PrinceOfEden> F
[1:27:05] <+sweetnesss688> new dragons dogma with DMC move sets
[1:27:09] <Hellarussian> restart
[1:27:11] <Jermatoo> Literally starring Devil May Cry LUL
[1:27:15] <Shooterboy23> @sarg1010 Well dmc4 came out in 2008 so....No.
[1:27:24] <SnaKemuho> now don't lose it ever
[1:27:29] <Pookiedaexzile> All of you are stupid, V is obviously the basis for the next Dark Stalkers game
[1:27:30] <suikudo> Those 3 million red orb taunts are lame as hell
[1:27:30] <%Ion_Laser> Denuvo sounds like a CPU throttleler
[1:27:31] <Giothegame> Yo @AngriestPat have you gotten S rank on Prologue yet? Somehow was easier to get on SoS
[1:27:33] <b_ikki> I'd like to know the difference between devil may cry and the devil may cry crew
[1:27:34] <alwayspronking> Nico? Nero.
[1:27:34] <RealPT1> does he not have the air guitar anymore?
[1:27:37] <ZaibatsuFan> A demon pie
[1:27:38] <JT137> V's violin is pritty up there
[1:27:44] <nox_nyctores> V has to do something?
[1:27:45] <yuribo26> Wait, the different announcer also change the style titles?
[1:27:53] <%Dr00_PhD> not true
[1:27:54] <Dragon_Batman> nice reward
[1:27:56] <%lewdskeletor13> She’s taking care of orphans
[1:27:56] <+SteveRail> i think for that one, you have to hit a moving platform down there
[1:27:58] <bxrby> Have you gotten the EX Provocation yet?
[1:27:59] <+zetaplus> @RealPT1 his air guitar is there. with a song included
[1:28:00] <Megapikman132> Only the vocal one.
[1:28:02] <%alexandrecau> @alwayspronking he is talking about the announcer
[1:28:04] <Megapikman132> The text is the same
[1:28:05] <RealPT1> nice
[1:28:05] <Xirn> they change what they say for the style titles, but not the visual
[1:28:08] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Why is Pat assuming that she will be baking a pie? I don't see a ring on her finger :P
[1:28:08] <TheWildVlad> @AngriestPat can you use two different busters one after another without losing style?
[1:28:09] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 my "setup" pat, is a pair of headphones plugged into my phone. the wire of which snapped a little bit ago due to the cold. now I'm sitting here drinking my sandwich in bed. Someone should mod over Shadow, Griffin, and Nightmare's models with Shadow the hedgehog, Femto, and Knightmare (SolCal) respectively. FOR THE MEMES.
[1:28:10] <rosemon5001> you know what would be weird vergil saying the style ranking qoutes
[1:28:12] <Shooterboy23> @yuribo26 No, every unique announcer just has their own names for the ranks.
[1:28:18] <GoldeNOVA> This area gives me big Nier Automata vibes
[1:28:19] <alwayspronking> @alexandrecau Yeah, isn't it Nero, or random?
[1:28:22] <yuribo26> @Xirn @Shooterboy23 thanks
[1:28:24] <PrinceOfEden> Favorite Taunts are Hood, Air Guitar, Air Violent, V's Spinning air taunt, and Dante's "You look like you just got your ass kicked"
[1:28:29] <kiryuva> !uptime
[1:28:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 54m.
[1:28:29] <StrangeCoincidence> How many times has Pat beaten this game?
[1:28:30] <nox_nyctores> Nico is a better announcer than Balrog
[1:28:32] <+Frostychip> Do you guys think we will get playable Vergil in dlc?
[1:28:35] <+EvilSoully> So yeah, I've only played DMC4 before this one, how does 5 stack up against the others? The best one?
[1:28:35] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Ive gotten over there without killing them all. Not sure why you cant :\
[1:28:36] <PrinceOfEden> Air Violin*
[1:28:40] <dero45> Love hood because it requires you to not get hit to keep it
[1:28:41] <%alexandrecau> the announcer for v and nero is nico, dante is morrisson
[1:28:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Because it's not gimicky
[1:28:44] <RealPT1> now does dante have an air instrument?
[1:28:48] <+tigerfang86> BEEF hard but you're also BEEFED
[1:28:48] <kakdela7> is there any difference between the devil bringer grab and the buster arm grab?
[1:28:48] <Clyderso> I'm loving this PATented stream!
[1:28:50] <Xirn> I love DMD once you've unlocked most stuff
[1:28:51] <+BorinCorran> @rosemon5001 At SSS does he just say "Now, you're motivated"?
[1:28:53] <%lewdskeletor13> @evilsoully Easily the best
[1:28:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 53412
[1:28:54] <Zombrocom> Is there any difference between Wire Snatch and Demon Snatch?
[1:28:54] <midnightmile> LDK is best
[1:28:57] <Shooterboy23> @AngriestPat DMD is pretty nerfed in this so now its actually fun.
[1:29:02] <JT137> Dante has Faust Kappa
[1:29:03] <Rang0Steel> @AngriestPat did you beat Urizen in prologue?
[1:29:04] <+Evitron1> @evilsoully if you think about it, vergil is already playable
[1:29:09] <ReiDuran> @AngriestPat please tell Woolie we love and appreciate him.
[1:29:09] <Shooterboy23> armor isn't as obnoxious on enemies
[1:29:13] <RealPT1> everyone should have some kind of air music taunt
[1:29:20] <+Arbal3st> Baller Alert!
[1:29:25] <freedomboyz> is ex-act easier in this game?
[1:29:29] <krksobk> you can already mod vergil in, but he's a bit broken
[1:29:33] <SnaKemuho> are Hell and Hell enemies SoS or DH difficulty in this?
[1:29:34] <Shooterboy23> @freedomREMM much easier
[1:29:41] <+Frostychip> I mean, technically he is playable, but I want actual Vergil gameplay
[1:29:42] <vonmaultke> Now Dante IS a gay cowboy pvpSK pvpSlay
[1:29:42] <rosemon5001> @BorinCorran lol yea
[1:29:44] <freedomboyz> thats dope
[1:29:45] <%Ion_Laser> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:29:47] <sappinmahbinyot> He's just incomplete @krksobk , just like V Kappa
[1:29:51] <freedomboyz> i can tell LUL
[1:29:54] <Kirby_Sauce> Someone mod over Shadow, Griffin, and Nightmare with Shadow the Hedgehog, Femto, and Knightmare respectively.
[1:29:55] <spire6> THAT'S RAD!
[1:29:59] <Clyderso> PogChamp
[1:30:01] <Dragon_Batman> It must be picky about the shot
[1:30:06] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat i notice you don't use a lot of the new moves on nero. do you just not like them?
[1:30:07] <%alexandrecau> holy shit are they like gonna throw goliath as regular enemy on higher difficulty
[1:30:14] <Megapikman132> Use DT
[1:30:16] <gogoszy> Charge shot plus tomboy?
[1:30:17] <yuribo26> LUL
[1:30:17] <RealPT1> dante should have a drumming taunt with Cerberus
[1:30:18] <RiverBirch> Do it F a s t e r
[1:30:21] <JT137> I know capcom has Vergil dlc somewhere
[1:30:21] <solarxlipse> Wat difficulty is this
[1:30:23] <rosemon5001> oh do that?
[1:30:23] <%hawk_rush> DO IT
[1:30:26] <Mangoesarentcats> We need a kool-aid man mod for nightmare
[1:30:28] <ShamanKing0811> YEYEYE DO IT

[1:30:30] <+tigerfang86> WHOA
[1:30:31] <%ThatGuyfromMars> sos @solarxlipse
[1:30:33] <%Ion_Laser> too late. someone probably is
[1:30:34] <%SuttonIsTrash> solarxlipse son of sparda
[1:30:35] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @AngriestPat DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT YOU'Re ONLY ENCOURAGING THEM
[1:30:40] <KirbonicAcid> Well now it's inevitable
[1:30:43] <Xirn> I saw the Buster counter to Vergil's Starscream attack earlier, that's so sick
[1:30:43] <ZaibatsuFan> Buster looks sick in Photo Mode
[1:30:47] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Well we will now Pat
[1:30:48] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Can you keep your lvl 3 charged shots with the air taunt?
[1:30:49] <person181> @gogoszy yes, it turns into a laser beam
[1:30:50] <$KnivesEve> i guess shadow is being modded in as we speak
[1:30:51] <vonmaultke> pvpMotivated pvpSlay heresy
[1:30:52] <Kirby_Sauce> love that he read it
[1:30:53] <Shooterboy23> Itsuno says they'll add Vergil if fans "demand it". LUL just say "we'll do it later" ffs
[1:30:54] <Lotharman> What about Mr.X in Nightmare's place?
[1:30:59] <Elsewize> What mode is this??
[1:31:00] <dekkitout> YES
[1:31:03] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Why is DMD not named Devils May Die?
[1:31:04] <PrinceOfEden> I'm not saying that the Fury is an annoying enemy, but the Fury is an Annoying enemy.
[1:31:08] <%Dr00_PhD> sos
[1:31:08] <RealPT1> man, I just love the violence in the buster animations
[1:31:09] <Covil91> If your DT gauge is capped you aren't using it enough.
[1:31:09] <T_Sasquatch> @Lotharman yes
[1:31:11] <Jermatoo> @AngriestPat Did you hear that theres a editor that lets you change your character to any of the 3 current ones for whatever mission you want? i.e. picking V for the final boss.
[1:31:13] <SnaKemuho> @stirlingw17 he doesn't have young man reaction times and memory
[1:31:30] <%gessho> Playing dmd right now
[1:31:30] <+wolfdude_120> Wait what the fuck that's breakable?
[1:31:33] <%TheFilth> so is there any use for the buster arm after getting dt?
[1:31:34] <%gessho> shit does so much damage
[1:31:35] <PrinceOfEden> I'm just waiting for the mods for this game
[1:31:39] <solarxlipse> @thatguyfrommars @suttonistrash thanks
[1:31:40] <Smaenus> awww YEEEEUH
[1:31:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Buster is more damage
[1:31:42] <bleugh> cuz nero is lame and doesn't deserve his own difficulty
[1:31:42] <PrinceOfEden> I loved the companion mod for DMC4
[1:31:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @solarxlipse <3
[1:31:46] <%SuttonIsTrash> solarxlipse np xcalGJ
[1:31:50] <Hitokiri222> gotta warn you guys. I eat poop
[1:31:50] <Jermatoo> @PrinceOfEden There's already a few more lewd ones on nexusmods.
[1:31:52] <PrinceOfEden> I really want this one to get one too
[1:31:54] <EchoXOF> @AngriestPat any tips on getting better at exceeding? Most normals don't really have visual information on when to press, although some moves like streak do.
[1:31:56] <Shraquet> Do you unlock these announcers by beating the game?
[1:31:57] <nox_nyctores> Nero having so many glowing things really highlights the lighting the game, it's extra beautiful
[1:31:59] <Dragon_Batman> Hah they knew
[1:32:01] <T_Sasquatch> fuck those bats
[1:32:02] <PrinceOfEden> @Jermatoo Good to know lucidLewd
[1:32:05] <%alexandrecau> @TheFilth charged move and does more damage
[1:32:06] <%lewdskeletor13> Nero is the best

[1:32:26] <%El_Desperad0> V plays the violin
[1:32:26] <RealPT1> YES
[1:32:26] <SpaceGuntank> NICE
[1:32:28] <ZaibatsuFan> Expectations: Exceeded
[1:32:29] <+Arsimckhoi> dante is a shitty guitar player
[1:32:30] <%TheFilth> @alexandrecau ahh cheers
[1:32:30] <Shraquet> DE?
[1:32:32] <freedomboyz> fucking Pog
[1:32:33] <PrinceOfEden> I'm sad that taunts don't raise your style ranking as much as they used to
[1:32:34] <hussdogrob> what mode is Pat on right now?
[1:32:41] <Smaenus> I want Nico to punch me in the face and call me a dumbass tbh
[1:32:42] <Crankthulhu> I wish post-game Nero's Devil Buster and Breaker arm weren't as redundant
[1:32:43] <PrinceOfEden> SoS @hussdogrob
[1:32:46] <danknugglit> Dmc is back
[1:32:47] <%skizzuto> @Shraquet deluxe edition
[1:32:48] <SnaKemuho> @echoxof most attacks exceed right when they connect with an enemy
[1:32:51] <%machshop> seed of sparda
[1:32:51] <Shraquet> Oh, I see.
[1:32:52] <alwayspronking> @AngriestPat DMC 5 spoilercast tomorrow?
[1:33:04] <%alexandrecau> try to grab the gas tank
[1:33:07] <Crankthulhu> Like, I wish they just replaced Wire Snatch with Devil Bringer Snatch, since why is he still using both?
[1:33:11] <Shraquet> The more I hear about the Deluxe Edition, the more I'm convinced that it's one of the few Deluxe Editions that's worth buyting.
[1:33:11] <%hawk_rush> woolie hasn't been it yet, tho, right?
[1:33:14] <+EvilSoully> @AngriestPat How many hhours you got on this game by now?
[1:33:14] <Shraquet> *buying.
[1:33:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie's playthrough isn't done being recorded yet
[1:33:14] <%skizzuto> @alwayspronking woolie hasn't beaten it yet
[1:33:21] <lastexile95> No alternate costumes?
[1:33:30] <Crankthulhu> Also, that there was some synergy between Buster throws and Buster Arm, like combo grabs, but it's just nitpickinbg
[1:33:31] <ReiDuran> What's the difference between Snatch with the robot arm and the demon arm?
[1:33:31] <danknugglit> Or has he?
[1:33:32] <Dragon_Batman> I think Pat isn't used to DT cuz he hasn't used it in a bit
[1:33:32] <Jermatoo> God Tomboy is so fucking cool
[1:33:37] <b_ikki> tomboy is so unga
[1:33:37] <%alexandrecau> tomboy is dempsey roll with a sword
[1:33:41] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat remember when we all thought the dmc 5 announcement was way to ballsy cause they said it would exceed all expectations. i think they followed up pretty damn well
[1:33:45] <+tigerfang86> WHOA
[1:33:45] <SnaKemuho> @echoxof stuff like ex launcher exceed right when they finish hitting an enemy
[1:33:45] <gogoszy> VECTOR CANNON
[1:33:47] <Hitokiri222> no I eat shit. just warning you guys
[1:33:48] <%Ion_Laser> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:33:56] <Shooterboy23> Wow woolie played through that much of the game and hasn't touched it since? Jesus the discipline on that man.
[1:33:56] <Shraquet> Nero DOES have a projectile.
[1:33:56] <gogoszy> YEET
[1:33:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Expectations Exceeded
[1:33:57] <Clyderso> That is so dope
[1:33:58] <Plague_bagel> hes having a bad day
[1:34:00] <PrinceOfEden> Whenever someone enters and leaves a fight with full DT I kill an Anime Cat girl. Think of the neko girls guys, spend your DT. I feel no pleasure in this role, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't take pride in it.
[1:34:01] <Megapikman132> USE DT
[1:34:03] <Covil91> Tomboy makes you play as red queen, Nero just tries to hang on.
[1:34:04] <Elsewize> Tomboy is best arm xD
[1:34:05] <sappinmahbinyot> Why is tomboy so cool
[1:34:05] <ZaibatsuFan> M O R T I S
[1:34:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> YO KNUCKLE TOMBOY
[1:34:14] <Jermatoo> @lastexile95 There's like one or two unlockable costumes but they're spoilery
[1:34:14] <Crankthulhu> @ReiDuran I tested it, both Snatches have the same range, its just Devil Snatch has always leads to a Buster throw while Breaker Snatch has the individual Breakers
[1:34:14] <InugamiTheHound> ichigo has unlocked his banaki
[1:34:22] <%TheFilth> so now with the punch you have two layers of rhythm with Nero
[1:34:32] <dsauce999> I can't believe that taunt is not max-actable Kappa
[1:34:35] <PrinceOfEden> Thanks Pat, I won't have to kill neko girl today.
[1:34:36] <bobbydrill> use it all the fuckin time dt charges really fast in this game
[1:34:38] <gogoszy> Oh god
[1:34:43] <sarg1010> So what do the different arms do?
[1:34:44] <%Cavumentum> Super-stand Nero
[1:34:45] <b_ikki> ora ora
[1:34:50] <Shooterboy23> now knuckle combo B
[1:34:59] <ReiDuran> Oh, cool, thanks
[1:35:00] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I must be playing too much fallout but I always get confused when people say DT then I realize this DMC
[1:35:14] <Crankthulhu> Also, the ORA ORA punches being the same input as the Devil Grab is kinda booty. Makes you fuck up combos with an accidental throw
[1:35:15] <ReiDuran> I just didn't realize there was a difference
[1:35:17] <Megapikman132> Try the buster on these guys!
[1:35:17] <+Exyoh> Any variants on jumps or attacks for DT with the Mega Buster?
[1:35:20] <%masneo2> was nero sweating?
[1:35:20] <TheWildVlad> this game can't possibly mediocre. not in a million years.
[1:35:24] <b_ikki> the music here is so weird
[1:35:25] <krksobk> buster, don't shoot
[1:35:29] <danknugglit> Ichigo went ultra instinct
[1:35:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> IT"S FUCKED WITH dt
[1:35:34] <Shooterboy23> This is a weird DMC1 reference
[1:35:34] <Clyderso> I wonder if Vergol will have a stand when playable.
[1:35:42] <krksobk> n e r o b l a n c o
[1:35:51] <%TheFilth> Vergil better get his motivation metre back
[1:35:51] <Crankthulhu> @ReiDuran They give you both inputs post game and the Devil Arm doesn't require DT. Weird flex by Capcom but hey, gives Nero more options so it's not that bad
[1:36:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Clyderso His version of Sin DT prob
[1:36:16] <Shooterboy23> I hope Vergil doesn't do a fucktillion damage like he did in 4
[1:36:18] <+Sighden> you think Ninja Team's Donte would have been more acceptable if they had instead called him Nero?
[1:36:27] <%claudesavegely> no
[1:36:27] <Clyderso> PogChamp
[1:36:30] <PrinceOfEden> Nah
[1:36:31] <%claudesavegely> Nero respects women
[1:36:31] <KaptainKappathe5th> "ah yes this is a lovely picture of sparks"
[1:36:32] <person181> no
[1:36:35] <%El_Desperad0> @Sighden no
[1:36:37] <Crankthulhu> @TheWildVlad The only things I can even nitpick is Lock-On is still shitty and some of the boss music is kinda boring, but other than that, 11/10
[1:36:37] <Shooterboy23> @Sighden is that not what they did here?
[1:36:38] <stirlingw17> i'm just glad they don't have blitzs in this game
[1:36:39] <Jermatoo> @Sighden The game would have done better if they had just not used the DMC namesake
[1:36:40] <Kirby_Sauce> I want there to be a room where you can fight one of every non-boss enemy in the game. AT ONCE
[1:36:51] <b_ikki> its crazy the jump from sos to dmd
[1:36:51] <PrinceOfEden> @KaptainKappathe5th I've had like 7 retakes because of those shots LUL
[1:36:56] <%alexandrecau> solely becaus epeople wouldn't have cared nero getting derailed back then
[1:36:57] <b_ikki> there should be a in between difficulty
[1:36:57] <+Exyoh> It'd be worse, given that Nero's a pure church boy
[1:37:03] <InugamiTheHound> oh its these assholes from DMC1
[1:37:05] <T_Sasquatch> YEYEYYEYEY
[1:37:06] <Someguy893> Use your DT
[1:37:07] <Crankthulhu> @Sighden Ninja Theory. Ninja Team did Ninja Gaiden, and a DMC from them would've been SICK
[1:37:08] <Clyderso> Yeyeyeye
[1:37:08] <Megapikman132> YEYEYEYE
[1:37:09] <T_Sasquatch> Buster that face
[1:37:14] <Shooterboy23> I think DmC's problem wasn't the character. It was the writing since Nero is just as Douchey as Donte.
[1:37:17] <+Sighden> Just wondering, cause Nero here gives me slight Donte vibe, like a better donte
[1:37:17] <Pixel_gee> SCUM
[1:37:30] <%TheFilth> Pat treats DT like mega-elixers
[1:37:39] <Crankthulhu> @Shooterboy23 Vanilla DmC had the color coded enemies which were a real problem
[1:37:39] <PrinceOfEden> Kills an anime cat girl
[1:37:39] <Jermatoo> @Shooterboy23 Honestly as much as I hate Tameem and how much of an asshole he was. I think NT got fucked by Capcom.
[1:37:41] <PrinceOfEden> YOU DID THIS PAT
[1:37:42] <dsauce999> SCHUM
[1:37:44] <PrinceOfEden> YOU DID THIS TO HER
[1:37:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Sighden it's the hair
[1:37:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Donte was always bad Nero
[1:37:50] <%theluckyhero> cheer100 Two things one did you know that the trophy for beating the game on Son of Sparada is called making Daddy proud which can't help me think of you guys. Two my good friends computer actual got exploded by trying to play dmc 5 so he never wants to play it again
[1:37:55] <+dougrayman> @AngriestPat what is your button configuration?
[1:37:56] <azamitomo> You can also do Knuckle while using the Blue Rose with Tomboy.
[1:37:56] <SnaKemuho> @shooterboy23 nah, Nero is a nice person who only gets douchey when shit gets real
[1:37:58] <%alexandrecau> @Sighden oh yes he clearly has some inspiration, especially when he activates his dt for the first time
[1:37:59] <b_ikki> yeah donte has been bad nero
[1:38:01] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat So DT just totally invalidates the Buster Arm doesn't it?
[1:38:04] <Shooterboy23> @Crankthulhu Yeah gameplay is WHOLE other topic. I could go on for days about those fuckups.
[1:38:07] <InugamiTheHound> Nero actually did a lot badass stuff in DMC4 unlike Dante from DmC
[1:38:08] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@yuribo26) (warning)
[1:38:09] <Clyderso> Instead of rejecting his humanity, Pat rejects his devil trigger
[1:38:11] <T_Sasquatch> that scared me so much on my first try
[1:38:11] <$spacehouse> From his balls
[1:38:13] <Morning_Asakura> genetic
[1:38:16] <+Lunarthewolf> power obsession is hereditary
[1:38:17] <%Dr00_PhD> nope
[1:38:18] <%Dr00_PhD> no
[1:38:19] <+BorinCorran> @Crankthulhu Making the witches that constantly scream at all times color based to weak ass weapons was the height of stupidity.
[1:38:21] <+sweetnesss688> aw
[1:38:22] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat pat please that shit is genetic
[1:38:25] <TheChampionofBoxes> I'm so glad they didn't name this game DMC:Devil May Cry 2
[1:38:26] <Shooterboy23> @SnaKemuho He makes fun of a soldier freaking out about his comrades being fucked up by demons.
[1:38:26] <Tucker0603> @screamingmeat buster arm still does more damage
[1:38:26] <Megapikman132> Naw, it's from when Credo died
[1:38:27] <dekkitout> Wack
[1:38:29] <sappinmahbinyot> Donte is literally bad nero. It was true in DMC4, too.

[1:38:33] <+Jajanken4> these are the best
[1:38:35] <Crankthulhu> @Jermatoo More like Tameem's ego hurt Ninja Theory. Capcom still let them work on DMC4SE and they have shown with Senua they can make good game
[1:38:35] <+Felremi> game worth buying?
[1:38:36] <+Exyoh> All Nero and Donte really have in common is the hair and hoodie. The attitude is all surface

[1:41:12] <Fujiwara_92> Reset
[1:41:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> So reminder. While some bosses are the same type of their Devil Arms in previous titles, Cerberus was still around in Dante's possession in Before the Nightmare
[1:41:17] <Buttku> BUSTER HER ON THE FLOOR
[1:41:18] <%alexandrecau> try to see if you can buster the tackle like vergil
[1:41:20] <+SteveRail> @KaptainKappathe5th that's part of it, the other half was that he would've died otherwise
[1:41:23] <Nobuwaroo> I'm curous, think nero is capable of gaining an SDT or is he too diluted?
[1:41:23] <%lewdskeletor13> @kaptainkappathe5th He was dying and split himself as a desperate attempt to save himself
[1:41:23] <b_ikki> let her do it again
[1:41:40] <mechslayer71> Didn’t pat say he would “absolutely” buster every boss? This is why I told him in the first place LUL
[1:41:41] <KaptainKappathe5th> so half survival, half POWER
[1:41:43] <+imporia_> so how did Urizen actually get the Artemis to stuff lady in?
[1:41:44] <KaptainKappathe5th> got it
[1:41:49] <b_ikki> youll get it eventually
[1:41:50] <$cureneckbeard> So in angel lore, certain powerful angels have three pairs of wings: one regular set to fly between Heaven and Earth, one set to cover their eyes so they cannot gaze upon God, and one set to cover their feet so as not to offend God. Also, "feet" was used in the Bible as a euphemism for genitals.
[1:41:53] <%SuttonIsTrash> KaptainKappathe5th pretty much
[1:41:55] <Crankthulhu> @KaptainKappathe5th He thought his human side was holding his back so he split it with Yamato's power. The tree eventually spawn's a fruit that gives you bonus Mega Demon Power to anyone who eats it. The whole thing is just an extension of Vergil's "I need more power" but taken to an EXTREME DEGREE
[1:41:57] <Shooterboy23> I think they're gonna make Nero a Nephillim in dmc6
[1:42:00] <PrinceOfEden> @imporia_ Science, nigga.
[1:42:00] <SnaKemuho> @kaptainkappathe5th he thought his human part was holding him back, but after getting back together yeah just wanted to fight his bro

[1:42:27] <+hypethefool> @angriestpat what do you feel about summoned swords being a family ability
[1:42:29] <frenchdipp> What difficulty do we have to beat to unlock Nico's van as a playable character?
[1:42:29] <mechslayer71> !uptime
[1:42:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 42m.
[1:42:29] <Fujiwara_92> Yeyeyeyeyeah
[1:42:33] <%hntronium> You did a good pat
[1:42:34] <%ThePuddingDead> pat beat this game at least 3 times guys
[1:42:34] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat You're the #1 DMC 5 stream on Twitch right now, congrats!
[1:42:35] <captain_kyen> You can also mash exceed to fill up quickly
[1:42:37] <zecht89> buster on this boss is boring tbh
[1:42:41] <Crankthulhu> @cureneckbeard Biblical angels were also mixtures of human and animal features, like having half-human, half-bull head. Which explains the designs of a lot of Bayonetta angels
[1:42:44] <captain_kyen> duing her buster
[1:42:46] <ravencloak13> @imporia_ Found the person who it was sold to and just turned it into a demon again. This thing going on in the game isn’t just in Red Grave City but everywhere.
[1:42:46] <wilsonfisker> is this Son of Sparda?
[1:42:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just hand the controller over to Elmo
[1:42:52] <%SuttonIsTrash> wilsonfisker yes
[1:42:53] <+EvilSoully> Is it ever explained how the swords stick to the backs of their coats, or is it just magic
[1:42:54] <Kirby_Sauce> "Angels May Fart"
[1:43:01] <Shooterboy23> shut the fuck up nero
[1:43:06] <yuribo26> You overshoot a little
[1:43:06] <%ScreamingMeat> Kinda sad that Artemis is destroyed now. It was a cool gun in DMC3
[1:43:06] <PrinceOfEden> ???
[1:43:08] <stirlingw17> remember the magic words pat. Yet for distance, Kobe for accuracy
[1:43:15] <%SuttonIsTrash> EvilSoully demon magic
[1:43:16] <Rang0Steel> @EvilSoully if you have enough style stuff sticks to you
[1:43:19] <Jathspuh> YET
[1:43:20] <ravencloak13> @evilsoully They can double jump with magic sigils. It’s magic.
[1:43:21] <%lewdskeletor13> @evilsoully Why does that even mayter
[1:43:22] <RantingRavager> YEET for distance. KOBE for accuracy
[1:43:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @cureneckbeard Just saw that. Show feet brings a whole new meaning
[1:43:27] <olafnuevo> hlol
[1:43:27] <PrinceOfEden> I love how artemis is basically an improved sanctus fight
[1:43:31] <Fujiwara_92> Yet
[1:43:36] <lizard0tm> Just found out you can buster Urizen
[1:43:41] <+ahdurian> Yet
[1:43:42] <%SuttonIsTrash> EvilSoully same reason why Dante's clothes never have holes in them from all the times he gets fucking impaled
[1:43:43] <%TheMattman1313> Oh hi Moonlight Butterfly
[1:43:46] <stirlingw17> @PrinceOfEden facts
[1:43:49] <%Rngiddion> i think he broke the fight somehow
[1:43:49] <Crankthulhu> @ravencloak13 Dante why the fuck are you eBaying your Devils Arms, YOU ARE DIRECTLY CAUSING THIS
[1:43:52] <+imporia_> Artemis arena and the level leading up to this are easily the nicest looking areas in the game
[1:43:57] <b_ikki> was that a trade
[1:43:57] <%drfaustisdead> No Pat. Fuck you Lady.
[1:43:59] <yuribo26> @TheMattman1313 you're wrong, this is fun
[1:44:01] <%SuttonIsTrash> TheMattman1313 thanks, now i cant unsee it
[1:44:02] <ravencloak13> @crankthulhu Rent money.
[1:44:07] <danknugglit> Thats lady not man :)
[1:44:08] <$XeroSigmaPrime> @lizard0tm SERIOUSLY?! His throne version? When the shield is down?
[1:44:11] <Jathspuh> soggyWhat
[1:44:16] <+EvilSoully> I only brought it up because of the way they hold them with their right hands in the live action cutscenes :P

[1:44:19] <%TheMattman1313> @SuttonIsTrash LUL
[1:44:22] <stirlingw17> @Crankthulhu how else he gonna pay the bills? he broke as fuck
[1:44:30] <PrinceOfEden> Pop your DT soon pat, or another neko girl dies
[1:44:31] <Shooterboy23> I like to imagine Urizen is just buying all of Dantes devil arms off Ebay like "hehehe what a dumbass"
[1:44:32] <%GurrenPrime> when urizens on the chair hes basically a sitting buster dummy
[1:44:35] <RantingRavager> LIGHT OF GOD
[1:44:37] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Crankthulhu) (warning)
[1:44:50] <RantingRavager> THE GRAB
[1:44:51] <ravencloak13> @crankthulhu His shop was destroyed at the beginning of DMC3
[1:44:51] <%ThePuddingDead> now now now
[1:44:53] <Rang0Steel> is there any difference between using the bringer for snatch or the breaker?
[1:44:55] <%TheGreatBamBe> can't wait for all the new doujins of trish and lady and what urizen did to them

[1:45:08] <SnaKemuho> Where are Jump Cancels Pat. Why do you refuse to gain power?
[1:45:09] <Crankthulhu> Dante needs to get a job as a cashier, then maybe he won't be actively threatening the world
[1:45:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> kinda lame

[1:45:17] <+enickma11> God bless this game
[1:45:18] <PunishedRaccoon> @AngriestPat you can rev the sword in that buster
[1:45:19] <HawkGoggles2> You can Exceed while you do that grab.
[1:45:20] <%MagickBurritoh> oh no
[1:45:21] <stirlingw17> you need to rev it when you do that
[1:45:21] <%lewdskeletor13> @heroicspiritavenger What?
[1:45:25] <+KaiserCrimson_1> You can rev that?!
[1:45:27] <PrinceOfEden> It's an echidna thing, you rev it @AngriestPat
[1:45:28] <ShreddingPixels> It was like the one you did in 4 on echidna
[1:45:29] <wilsonfisker> lady was so lame in this game 😂
[1:45:30] <ravencloak13> @crankthulhu What fucking cashier not on welfare can pay rent?
[1:45:34] <JT137> i bet you can buster that
[1:45:40] <%ThePuddingDead> i love how bosses in this game have monster hunter style ai
[1:45:42] <%alexandrecau> try busting when she she flies at you
[1:45:49] <+TheBrazilianHope> didn't rev t90Cry
[1:45:49] <%ThePuddingDead> the lower the health the more crazy there attacks get
[1:45:50] <Crankthulhu> @ravencloak13 One where you can DT the bagging
[1:45:57] <nox_nyctores> I still haven't seen what that attack does and I'm not looking the day I fail to prevent it
[1:45:58] <%alexandrecau> not sure if it works
[1:45:59] <Shooterboy23> Dante doesn't even speak to Lady or acknowledge her in this game
[1:45:59] <%Dr_FoxWolf> @rang0steel The breaker is way stronger
[1:46:00] <T_Sasquatch> @AngriestPat Dont forget you have the an extra 3rd jump
[1:46:02] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> vargLouter
[1:46:02] <heroicspiritavenger> @lewdskeletor13 Lady jobs to Urizen, becomes his minion essentially, and Lady was the one carrying Artemis at the time
[1:46:04] <Pillagius> @JT137 well you can buster Vergil doing that same move so I guess you can buster her too
[1:46:08] <+jyeowa> boy i'm coming off of the woolieVS lp and i am CONFUSED but hapy with what i'm looking at
[1:46:14] <yuribo26> BANNED

[1:56:00] <@Mechz71> and yeah book on L2
[1:56:00] <dukenux> Of course he only wears one glove LUL
[1:56:05] <tacostarvedbeast> pat has the right idea of ladys control scheme so ill trust what he say its best for V
[1:56:09] <PrinceOfEden> Letting you guys know one last time, Fanatical is having a sale that includes DMC5 for $48.

[2:00:17] <Artista_AF> i read the wiki explaining why V calls his demon half Urizen
[2:00:19] <Zerud> no white hair
[2:00:21] <thebakaliyen> when you use Red-orbs on vi for abilities are they technically V-Bucks?
[2:00:22] <ReiDuran> @AngriestPat Infant Joy is where V gets "I have no name, I am but two days old"
[2:00:23] <emillionghost> mod that guy in

[2:00:28] <PsychoFlash1> @Artista_AF Why is that?
[2:00:32] <ravencloak13> Fucking hell. Look a V’s sandals now. They look like sandals a fucking beach bum would wear.
[2:00:38] <+Exyoh> Look Blake's art up if you want some cool occult paintings and muscly demon dudes. He wasn't just a poet
[2:00:40] <dukenux> It's because Urizen is Blake's demon
[2:00:41] <Jdoom12> I missed book in the tutorial and can't seem to find it and don't see a listing in the controls. Don't want to re do the mission. What was the default control?
[2:00:45] <monzy101> Pimp slaped

[2:00:57] <lizard0tm> V is wearing flip flops now?
[2:00:58] <Artista_AF> Urizen is the name of a god in Blake's poem; kinda like his cthullu
[2:01:00] <FenixSeraph> V's outfit in general is kinda silly but his sandals are the worst part
[2:01:01] <%lewdskeletor13> Urizen was a god in Blake’s writings
[2:01:04] <T_Sasquatch> can you imagine dragons dogma 2 in THIS ENGINE
[2:01:07] <T_Sasquatch> PogChamp

[2:01:59] <Idon__> V is what Vergil would've become if he was saved.
[2:02:00] <%gnarly_memes_bro> this is true
[2:02:03] <Prevot> at least he's not wearing socks and sandals
[2:02:06] <%AncelDeLambert> he's Vergil's humanity, or some shit
[2:02:08] <$cureneckbeard> They're probably like magic sandals that give him +15% evade
[2:02:09] <%AncelDeLambert> bet
[2:02:10] <Shooterboy23> GEE I DUNNO PAT
[2:02:10] <%lewdskeletor13> V is all of Vergil’s nerdiness

[2:02:18] <T_Sasquatch> @wolfofsound i am asssuming capGOD is making a dragons dogma 2 because making the anime on netflix is too random
[2:02:19] <indig0bird> He just misses his power
[2:02:20] <kakdela7> I really like the implication that Vergil had to write his name on all his stuff or Dante would take it, and that why's V's book has a V on it
[2:02:20] <+Sp3ctre48> Not exactly, V still really wants to kill Dante
[2:02:20] <%Ganerumo> @AngriestPat nah cuz V is still an asshole, he's just smarmier whereas Urizen is no business
[2:02:22] <sevelodon> vergil with his demon side is a weaboo
[2:02:22] <aimlesshealer> Sparda was good
[2:02:23] <$valriot> He is good, just a dumbass
[2:02:24] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat I think it implies if Vergil was saved during the fire he'd be a better person.
[2:02:25] <+d00msdaydan> POWER
[2:02:25] <masso101> He should be wearing socks with those to complete the loser package.
[2:02:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> He's a good person after the game ends so his time as V was well spent
[2:02:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Artista_AF Well they were spoiling a bunch of stuff, so I assumed that was real too
[2:02:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> DAS RACIST!
[2:02:26] <%Dr_DangerPhD> V still wants to murder dante tho
[2:02:28] <+yourwayworkstoo> Well V is not a good person\
[2:02:28] <+AXL808> Vergil IS an asshole
[2:02:29] <+DAIROCKETTO> more like without his insane powerlust he he actually bothers to reflect on what he's done
[2:02:30] <ShmowzowKapow> v isnt a good person
[2:02:30] <FenixSeraph> he's Nero's conscience
[2:02:31] <R3c0n31> V is also super edgy
[2:02:31] <person181> V wears the most optamil gear
[2:02:31] <%Konquerer> demon's are kind of dicks
[2:02:31] <dukenux> V is Vergil without his hangups on mamoru MOTHER
[2:02:31] <+chimaera24> @AngriestPat He still almost kills Dante even as V
[2:02:32] <bursky00> Vergil is not evil just really SALTY
[2:02:33] <%PlainSimpleTailor> What's fucked up about that?
[2:02:33] <ravencloak13> They are implying that he’d be less power hungry.
[2:02:34] <Basch71> he's a weeb and a nerd
[2:02:36] <+Amazcheema10> I love how all the character depth V has Is just Vergil
[2:02:36] <%Nobrev> he's what vergil would be if he wasn't blinded by ambition
[2:02:39] <%Halowood> V killed a dude to give Morrison money to hire Dante, Dante will take demon hunting jobs for free
[2:02:46] <KaptainKappathe5th> LAG
[2:02:47] <+JavaManJoJo> It could be that this is what he'd be like if Dante and him had their situations switched with getting saved n stuff
[2:02:48] <Dragon_Batman> dunno, he mentions he thinks his life could be different if his roles were switched with Dante's
[2:02:48] <Jermatoo> OOF that frame drop
[2:02:48] <%El_Desperad0> Vergil is still an irredeemable asshole tho
[2:02:48] <Tha_Mik> LUL
[2:02:49] <waifoong98> LUL
[2:02:49] <Jermatoo> Jesus
[2:02:49] <%ThePuddingDead> uh
[2:02:50] <%NopeBadguy> The implication is the truly human side of him would've known what was right if even it at its core didn't lust for power
[2:02:53] <reonome> holy framerate batman
[2:02:57] <Artista_AF> i dunno if good person, but V is seriously a massive nerd... so i guess Vergil is a Closet Nerd LUL
[2:02:57] <Dragon_Batman> so probably not
[2:02:59] <zecht89> no, this just his true persona
[2:02:59] <Mutanthunter> Does that imply that virgil likes poetry and classical music too?
[2:03:00] <$cureneckbeard> V
[2:03:00] <%MelBrooksKA> @Konquerer Except when they wake up to JUSTICE!
[2:03:01] <+kilikhelios> oh boi
[2:03:01] <aimlesshealer> Vergil's a complete doofus
[2:03:03] <%Dagman72> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:03:03] <Tha_Mik> V too powerfull
[2:03:08] <%ThePuddingDead> do u not like royal fork Pat?
[2:03:10] <+yourwayworkstoo> V is lying the whole game. Hes only playing nice to get to the point he gets to at the end of the game
[2:03:11] <xtremegamer80> SKa
[2:03:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> CHUUGGGG
[2:03:14] <%Konquerer> @MelBrooksKA true
[2:03:18] <dukenux> YE YE YE YE
[2:03:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> V is Vergil waking up to justice PogChamp
[2:03:19] <%lewdskeletor13> @artista_af “Closet” nerd? Do you know Vergil?
[2:03:20] <waifoong98> Man this game would die if LDK is in the game LUL
[2:03:21] <+deemans> The Human side of him didn't have the same lust for power and was forced to rely on others
[2:03:22] <Idon__> Vergil stabs Dante and accidentally creates "D" who is essentially Travis Touchdown.
[2:03:22] <+daisyyyy> Vergil is just salty omfg
[2:03:22] <%gusdabus91> wow rude
[2:03:29] <dukenux> Tony Hawk that shit
[2:03:29] <juxtest> Would a good person knock over all those shelves?
[2:03:30] <+Sirsqueebe> Somebody farmed some red orbs.
[2:03:30] <%MagickBurritoh> equivalent to rolling through pottery
[2:03:31] <dekkitout> Well- V is a form of Vergil, so it's natural he'd be too strong for the system
[2:03:32] <+Amazcheema10> vergil good human bad demon, dante bad human good demon
[2:03:33] <+deemans> definitely humbled Vergil
[2:03:37] <Prism_Wing> No skating in the goddamn warehouse, Jimmy! SwiftRage
[2:03:38] <televisedrevolting> @yourwayworkstoo I disagree with that assumption.
[2:03:41] <dukenux> Punished Vergil?
[2:03:42] <absolute_cagemony> wait what's happening I thought pat was further than this
[2:03:42] <%Dagman72> VoHiYo
[2:03:47] <T_Sasquatch> NIGHTMARE gonna give it to ya
[2:03:49] <+Sp3ctre48> I wouldnt say he's playing nice, just that he didnt tell them what he would do once they actually beat Urizen
[2:03:52] <%ThePuddingDead> HEY Kool Aid!
[2:03:53] <Artista_AF> @lewdskeletor13 he wasn't QUOTING the poetry he read in 3 LUL

[2:05:29] <%TheFilth> Crew Cut as a playable character when?
[2:05:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @Shooterboy23 would you prefer the William Tell overture?
[2:05:30] <%lewdskeletor13> I think V’s decision to merge with Urizen was a last minute decision out of desperation
[2:05:32] <ravencloak13> Elmo, become as Shadow.
[2:05:34] <ShmowzowKapow> grenade PogChamp
[2:05:36] <tacostarvedbeast> eye ball grenade
[2:05:36] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat do you think theres any way V can come back in some fashion for a future DMC game?
[2:05:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Which are used as grenades
[2:05:37] <%joylent_blue> V'S SO COOL YOU GUYs
[2:05:43] <PrinceOfEden> And his eye EXPLODES Pat
[2:05:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But his eye is a grenade
[2:05:55] <+Sp3ctre48> Nah I think he always intended to reunite with Urizen
[2:05:57] <waifoong98> what was his motive???
[2:05:58] <Archmortal> "I must reach him before he loses completely."
[2:05:58] <absolute_cagemony> V will come back as Virgil's other son
[2:06:00] <KaptainKappathe5th> he wants urizen to lose so he can merge with him
[2:06:00] <damdash16> Morrison playable when?
[2:06:00] <televisedrevolting> Contrite?
[2:06:01] <%Ganerumo> @AngriestPat He's still Vergil, he still has lust for power.
[2:06:03] <R3c0n31> The desperation?
[2:06:07] <+yourwayworkstoo> Its because he was bullshitting
[2:06:10] <Shooterboy23> He doesn't want to die but he is still a good person
[2:06:10] <SnakeBelmont> his eye is a grenade
[2:06:11] <$ooblagis> Stopping Urizen and not dying weren't mutually exclusive
[2:06:11] <aimlesshealer> I think he realized that splitting himself was a mistake, but he still didn't want to die
[2:06:12] <ravencloak13> So what’s the song V does when he plays his cane like a violin?
[2:06:13] <JT137> pat he needs more power
[2:06:14] <Toxic_Phazon> He wants to be whole, if urizen gets too powerful he won't need V
[2:06:15] <$valriot> Not really
[2:06:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> He's close to nutting. Who wouldn't change behavior
[2:06:18] <SnaKemuho> Well, what would you do if you were crumbling into dust
[2:06:18] <Artista_AF> he's in Power Rehab basically
[2:06:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> because the demon half has rejoined pat @AngriestPat
[2:06:22] <%lewdskeletor13> It was a last minute decision borne out of desperation I think
[2:06:22] <ReiDuran> @AngriestPat the "must kill Urizen" is just a front to get him back to his old self
[2:06:22] <dekkitout> A Vergil by any other name is stilll an asshole
[2:06:24] <televisedrevolting> @yourwayworkstoo I don't agree with that.
[2:06:25] <T_Sasquatch> if v didnt combine with urizen he would have died
[2:06:25] <R3c0n31> "Good"
[2:06:28] <+Sirsqueebe> he needs to stop urizen from dying si what he truly meant
[2:06:29] <+daisyyyy> He saw a way not to die
[2:06:30] <Shooterboy23> @AngriestPat Its almost like he's in a conflict with himself
[2:06:31] <$XeroSigmaPrime> When he says him and Urizen have one thing in common, they have their lust for power
[2:06:31] <$lolslowking> I think merging was always the plan, he just needed Urizen weak enough to pull it off
[2:06:32] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat I think that the idea is that when he's faced with the idea of what is essentially death, he becomes desparate and merges to save himself.
[2:06:35] <%Dr_DangerPhD> V's plan was never to stop Urizen, it was to recombine. He was lying the entire time
[2:06:35] <MrBiocrosss> i assumed he wanted Urizen to be weak enough for him to recombine
[2:06:36] <$ooblagis> Stopping Urizen was his main goal, but regaining his form was a secondary goal
[2:06:38] <+Exyoh> Things looked dicey when he was dangling Sparda in Dante's face. His self-control seems kinda unstable
[2:06:41] <kakdela7> I don't think he actually planned it from the beginning
[2:06:43] <Damie904> Vergil is addicted to power and feeling strong is what that means
[2:06:44] <bursky00> Because his basically Salty that Dante is doing better than him. He can't just let go of the years of resentment towards his brother.
[2:06:46] <filialpails> defeating urizen isn't a lie, he needs to defeat him in order to rejoin with him
[2:06:50] <+Sirsqueebe> he never lied
[2:06:52] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Everybody turns into a Shit when they get comfortable
[2:06:52] <pillowwasp> Would Dante’s V still look like V?
[2:06:56] <SnaKemuho> Urizen couldn't accept his human side, so V had to accept his demon side
[2:06:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Remember Nashandra? Wanted power the MOST because she was the weakest?
[2:06:57] <%ThePuddingDead> they still had the same goal in mind, one didnt have any reason to hold back without his humanity, the humanity aspect still wanted to beat Dante still, but was conscious of the consequences of that goal can cause @AngriestPat
[2:06:57] <+KaiserCrimson_1> I imagine the idea was to actually stop Urizen until his degredation started accelerating. Dude was down with the plan until he realized he was gonna die too lol
[2:06:58] <televisedrevolting> Even when he's alone he's talking about he can't let Urizen gain power.
[2:06:59] <KaptainKappathe5th> he needs urizen to be weak enough that he will let v recombine into vergil
[2:07:02] <%alexandrecau> his smile when nero bring him to urizen implies he was scheming it
[2:07:05] <%lewdskeletor13> @dr_dangerphd Lying when he’s by himself? I don’t think so
[2:07:07] <aimlesshealer> V didn't lie, he just didn't tell everyone what was going on
[2:07:09] <dekkitout> Dante's V would probably be a hipster
[2:07:12] <%TheMilhouseExperience> *too comfortable
[2:07:14] <$valriot> i mean by the end of the game, he seems to of worked out a lot of his grievances, and just kinda fights Dante for fun
[2:07:16] <Prevot> Dante's V would look like Donte
[2:07:16] <sappinmahbinyot> @pillowwasp it would look like anakin
[2:07:19] <R3c0n31> OH YEA
[2:07:21] <Artista_AF> Oh Yeah!
[2:07:23] <aimlesshealer> @Prevot Dante's V is Tony Hawk
[2:07:23] <JT137> Dante's V would be Donte Kappa
[2:07:27] <+Sp3ctre48> Nightmare pls, you're killing the frames
[2:07:28] <dekkitout> @Prevot Oh god, you're right
[2:07:29] <%skizzuto> maybe he's worried if Urizen gains too much power dante and nero won't beat him and V won't be able to re-fuse
[2:07:29] <sevelodon> what would D's playstyle be like
[2:07:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I think he was just giddy after he knew Urizen already ate the fruit
[2:07:31] <Prism_Wing> Dante's V would be Napolean Dynamite.
[2:07:34] <%AncelDeLambert> HE DOES ZANGIEF SPINS!!!
[2:07:34] <%TheFilth> basically the whole plot of the game was a means to get true Vergil back in the story
[2:07:34] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Prevot not in a million years
[2:07:34] <%ThePuddingDead> he dont
[2:07:36] <KaptainKappathe5th> GOOD PIC
[2:07:37] <waifoong98> 'is this SOS difficulty?
[2:07:37] <spire6> Oof
[2:07:40] <%MagickBurritoh> good photo
[2:07:41] <Megapikman132> Sos
[2:07:41] <b_ikki> dante's v would be steve buschemi with the backward cap
[2:07:41] <xtremegamer80> Nightmare's Fist LMAO
[2:07:44] <%lloyddboy> RETAKE
[2:07:46] <+daisyyyy> Or he knows urizen needs to go down, but hed recombine if he had a chance
[2:07:46] <CalderGaming> just logged on. what difficult are we on?
[2:07:48] <Prism_Wing> Or D, rather lol.
[2:07:48] <Idon__> Yeah SoS
[2:07:49] <%gnarly_memes_bro> No Dante's V would be Totally Kyle from te Amanda Show
[2:07:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> sos
[2:07:50] <Artista_AF> nah Dante's V would be Itsuno
[2:07:50] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @lewdskeletor13 If V never wanted to recombine, why did he tell Dante he was leaving at the beginning of the game and then show up at Urizen's throne?
[2:07:51] <FuqBoiSlim> NICE FUCKING PIC
[2:07:51] <absolute_cagemony> I like how by the end of the game everyone just kind of forget that Virgil's actions cost the lives of thousands of people...
[2:07:53] <sappinmahbinyot> D quotes mexican telenovelas instead of edgy literature
[2:07:56] <masso101> He talks about his lust for power like an addiction. He's probably a good person at heart, but that feeling makes him act how he does.
[2:07:57] <CalderGaming> kk
[2:08:03] <aimlesshealer> And because Urizen had ALL OF THE POWER and STILL lost, Vergil has to concede
[2:08:06] <dukenux> Now do the Air Christ
[2:08:08] <SnaKemuho> What would Pat's V be
[2:08:11] <ravencloak13> Wait, since Yamato can separate demons and humans and Rebellion can fuse them... could Rebellion fuse some random as demon to a normal human?
[2:08:15] <Shooterboy23> @IdiotWithADHDGamer *100's
[2:08:19] <natebud> game just started crashing on me today. Played through human no problem. Now having Nightmare out on SOS is destroying my framerate
[2:08:21] <$valriot> Pat is Pats V
[2:08:22] <%lewdskeletor13> @dr_dangerphd He showed up with Nero, “the Insurance policy”
[2:08:22] <Shooterboy23> and its not that big a deal Kappa
[2:08:26] <dekkitout> Aw man, I'm lovin the D lore chat's drafting up
[2:08:29] <Artista_AF> Pat is the V; Paige is the Urizen
[2:08:31] <%TheFilth> Pat's V would be a ginger Elmo
[2:08:33] <bursky00> @valriot that's after Dante revealed he had a son and when Nero proved himself.
[2:08:43] <JT137> pats V is Liam Kappa
[2:08:45] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @ravencloak13 maybe lol, lets attach a frog to an empusa
[2:08:46] <+Higgsworth> Pat is Louis CK's V
[2:08:47] <waifoong98> come on Pat, parry these dual blades fuckers LUL
[2:08:50] <dukenux> Pat's V would be Rich Evans
[2:08:51] <$valriot> Pats Urizen is a toilet on a chair
[2:08:51] <KaptainKappathe5th> paige is v because shes always dying
[2:08:53] <freedomboyz> he went after the car LUL
[2:08:54] <%hntronium> Is griffon singing V's thene song?
[2:09:02] <absolute_cagemony> Pat's V is Ronald Weasly.
[2:09:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ravencloak13 dante's kids are going to be weird.
[2:09:11] <waifoong98> I see
[2:09:17] <PrinceOfEden> Don't get me wrong, I like V, but I'd like him more of he could also attack a little bit more.
[2:09:19] <CurrySauseBandit> Dante having kids. LUL
[2:09:20] <%MagickBurritoh> are those green crystals just crystalized style?
[2:09:21] <pillowwasp> D would be a professional air guitarist
[2:09:21] <joshuaoverheaven> How do you get that green V outfit?
[2:09:22] <aimlesshealer> If Paige is V then what is her Urizen?
[2:09:22] <ravencloak13> @gnarly_memes_bro Actually hell. Didn’t the Order do something similar?
[2:09:23] <dukenux> Or
[2:09:27] <%ThePuddingDead> whyyy are you lyyyiiinnng?
[2:09:28] <Prevot> >dante not being a virgin
[2:09:28] <%lewdskeletor13> I guess V just lies when he’s completely by himself
[2:09:32] <dukenux> What if Pat is Louis CK's V?
[2:09:38] <JC9912> @AngriestPat You can parry with V's cane
[2:09:41] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Pat's V is an autoblow with an orange wig glued on the top
[2:09:48] <ravencloak13> @sphincter_spelunker Fuck, maybe the whole game with them we’d be fusing with whatever demon we want to that we fight.
[2:09:50] <KaptainKappathe5th> hes not lying to himself god dammit!
[2:09:50] <waifoong98> @KaiserCrimson_1 LUL
[2:09:51] <%drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat V's great because you get insight into Virgil's personality without a bunch of expository dialogue.
[2:09:51] <dekkitout> I can see Pat as the Nightmare to Paige's V and Elmo as Shadow I guess Plague is Griffon or something...
[2:09:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Vergils desire for power is rooted in feelings of abandonment and betrayal, so that warps up what would otherwise still be goofy pizza dante
[2:09:56] <reonome> Pat is Paige's V
[2:09:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> is V a Kingdom Hearts Nobody while Urizen is a Heartless? Kappa
[2:09:58] <%MelBrooksKA> Nobody has been saying that Pat
[2:09:58] <+Higgsworth> @dukenux Nice copying me
[2:10:00] <KaptainKappathe5th> he needs urizen to be weak so he can recombine!
[2:10:08] <Archmortal> Urizen. He isn't just Dante's reason, he's V's reason. Urizen is power.
[2:10:12] <%Ganerumo> idk I think V is legit persuaded he has to stop Urizen somehow and he just falls victim to the same issues Vergil had
[2:10:14] <%TheFilth> I guess Pat's Urizen would be off-screen grinding incarnate
[2:10:15] <SnaKemuho> I'm just thinking that Pat's V would be some gross person who has to accept his gross human fluids
[2:10:21] <stirlingw17> could it be from his whole experience later on where his summons get separated from him. that might have impacted his personality
[2:10:22] <Brackleforth> sassy
[2:10:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ravencloak13 Little Kirby's LUL
[2:10:30] <benjiFG> I can't imagine playing as V without the defense upgrades
[2:10:39] <%lewdskeletor13> I was saying that sarcastically Pat, I don’t think he’s lying at all, it was a last minute decision @angriestpat
[2:10:39] <person181> pats V would have no fear of shitting his pants
[2:10:39] <Artista_AF> some people is, considering that he's constantly "i must STOP Urizeen before is too late" to himself
[2:10:47] <waifoong98> hmmmm, now that I think about it, isn't this just a Jagras on Steroid LUL
[2:10:47] <ravencloak13> @sphincter_spelunker Maybe not eldritch levels but close.
[2:10:47] <juxtest> BELLYFLOP
[2:10:48] <Clyderso> The aerial checkmates are cool
[2:10:48] <KaptainKappathe5th> @Ganerumo no, he does need to stop urizen from getting strong, because if urizen is too strong he wont need to recombine with V
[2:10:50] <b_ikki> sick belly flop
[2:10:51] <dukenux> @Higgsworth dude, if you can read every message that goes through chat at 4 am then congratulations
[2:10:52] <Idon__> The Body Splash is my absolute favorite.
[2:10:52] <PrinceOfEden> I'm now realizing, if we get a DMC6, we will need a replacement for V. MikeHogu
[2:10:55] <gogoszy> DYNAMIC ENRTY
[2:10:59] <bsmusic> LUL
[2:11:03] <Jermatoo> @AngriestPat How does it feel knowing that Monster Hunter as a series is 15 years old as of today.
[2:11:08] <KaptainKappathe5th> IT WASNT
[2:11:14] <%claudesavegely> 15 years of monhun
[2:11:14] <Megapikman132> what was?
[2:11:14] <Spiderfacev> @PrinceOfEden Nico with robot pets
[2:11:15] <Artista_AF> V becomes an alt style for Vergil LUL
[2:11:15] <+Higgsworth> @dukenux Its not moving very fast, and it was word for word. I'm calling my lawyer.
[2:11:16] <%claudesavegely> is good
[2:11:17] <Archmortal> Why would he need to get to Urizen before he loses completely, if it was a last minute decision?
[2:11:19] <+Sp3ctre48> I really doubt V just stays dead after this
[2:11:19] <Idon__> It's like Nightmare just tripped off a building.
[2:11:20] <televisedrevolting> @kaptainkappathe5th I disagree
[2:11:23] <KaptainKappathe5th> it was clearly his plan the whole time
[2:11:23] <+KaiserCrimson_1> @PrinceOfEden inb4 Patty comes back as a devil summoner Kappa
[2:11:27] <%ThePuddingDead> happy birthday monhun!
[2:11:29] <JT137> So where is the Yamato?
[2:11:32] <waifoong98> I wish they fix the weapon variety and element Cap in World
[2:11:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> THANK YOU CAPCOM
[2:11:34] <%claudesavegely> yeah they updated the aniversary site
[2:11:35] <SnaKemuho> @princeofeden hopefully with more variety, like switching summons and having more of his own moves
[2:11:36] <wsintai> In the prequel novel, V spends the entire month in between the prologue going around and saving people. I think he's actually just a half decent person
[2:11:36] <PrinceOfEden> @Spiderfacev I would fucking LOVE that.
[2:11:37] <damdash16> I hope DMC6 is nero and nico banding together demon hunters all over the DMC universe
[2:11:37] <Ir_ramble> this game gives me the big nips
[2:11:37] <%claudesavegely> and put up some neat art
[2:11:38] <SpaceGuntank> happy birthday monster hunter!
[2:11:41] <%lewdskeletor13> I agree for sure. His whole speech to Urizen sounds like he just decided to do that
[2:11:43] <+unkle_sterben> Man, after finishing the game today, I really wish the trailers didn't reveal that Vergil was gonna be in. It made the reveal of Urizen's identity significantly less powerful.
[2:11:43] <PrinceOfEden> @SnaKemuho This
[2:11:43] <dekkitout> 15? Oh lord, it's setting in NotLikeThis
[2:11:47] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> They could just bring V back again for Bloody Palace in future games
[2:11:47] <Idon__> So here I am, doing everything I can.
[2:11:49] <%skizzuto> do they ever explain what V's cane is?
[2:11:49] <+KillswitchLikesToPlay> 15 years ?1 Fuck we're old
[2:11:50] <Artista_AF> Urizen has the Yamato
[2:11:50] <Prevot> that feel when every MH clone feels 7 years behind MH
[2:11:51] <$ooblagis> The original 4chan leaker who called EVERYTHING from before the E3 reveal said that V was Vergil. They knew for a while who V was going to be
[2:11:51] <+wolfdude_120> Can Demi-Fiend take V's place as a summoner character for DMC 6?
[2:11:52] <+BorinCorran> @PrinceOfEden Give it to Kyrie, she summons angelic looking demons and her brother on her DT.
[2:11:53] <bsmusic> Yamato is with Urizen
[2:11:54] <absolute_cagemony> Kyrie as a devil summoner. She charms them with her nun powers.
[2:11:57] <%joylent_blue> JT137 with Urizen
[2:11:57] <%El_Desperad0> emlo
[2:12:01] <gogoszy> WOO
[2:12:06] <PrinceOfEden> Credo BibleThump
[2:12:07] <sappinmahbinyot> @wsintai Would make sense. Especially considering how Vergil is by the end of the game
[2:12:09] <+ahegotrigger> this is so nuts
[2:12:15] <joshuaoverheaven> I need that V alt color TakeNRG
[2:12:17] <gogoszy> Explosions everywhere
[2:12:20] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I think the whole reason he split in the first place was he needed to be a pure demon to grow the qliphoth and eat the fruit.
[2:12:20] <aimlesshealer> Idk, I like Kyrie being removed from all the crazy action. She's just a normal girl
[2:12:25] <nox_nyctores> SUPER SEXY SEXY
[2:12:27] <fairore> kyrie going to have v gameplay in dmc 6
[2:12:29] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Then Kyrie really WILL be Orihime lol
[2:12:29] <b_ikki> man bp with v is gonna be wild
[2:12:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> SSS PogChamp
[2:12:40] <Huntercd> Pat do combo
[2:12:43] <SnaKemuho> @b_ikki or boring
[2:12:43] <absolute_cagemony> I got my first SSS in this game with V... I'm kind of upset about it.
[2:12:43] <typocursedramona> @AngriestPat thanks you for introducing me to DMC with the sbfp lets plays cause this shit is hype
[2:12:46] <Pixel_gee> V's theme is really growing on me, i love it.
[2:12:47] <dukenux> @Higgsworth well im gonna call precedent of hundreds of people comparing Pat to Louis CK overthe yeas
[2:12:49] <sappinmahbinyot> Dear got Nightmare kills everything
[2:12:51] <waifoong98> What are these photos thing?
[2:12:52] <%lloyddboy> HOW DOES IT WORK
[2:12:56] <RantingRavager> DO BIG COMBO
[2:12:57] <PrinceOfEden> I'm running V through bloody palace first
[2:13:00] <SyncNet> Does reading the book only charge the 3 bars of the DT?
[2:13:01] <dukenux> DO BETTER COMBO
[2:13:05] <Videogamer4> do a better combo
[2:13:08] <Idon__> How the hell are we gonna deal with BP Vergil as V, lmao
[2:13:09] <Videogamer4> LUL
[2:13:10] <Clyderso> LUL
[2:13:11] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Deano8817) (warning)
[2:13:11] <b_ikki> the names here are fun memes
[2:13:12] <wsintai> @waifoong98 In new game+ you get them as comments on enemies the first time you kill them
[2:13:13] <+Krando> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[2:13:13] <mak0t0yukii> Bloody palace Co-op would be fun tdogDog
[2:13:13] <+Sp3ctre48> Imagine V and Dante in Bloody Palace together NotLikeThis
[2:13:14] <alrobot2014> im still wondering how to beat dsd dante in bp
[2:13:15] <Huntercd> Do more Combo
[2:13:15] <b_ikki> bael the butcher
[2:13:18] <waifoong98> @wsintai neat
[2:13:22] <+JavaManJoJo> DMCV is my first dmc because of you guys and it was great
[2:13:23] <%gnarly_memes_bro> no it fully charges
[2:13:26] <stirlingw17> i can't wait to run through bloody palace as dante
[2:13:27] <absolute_cagemony> @SyncNet nope it charges the whole damn thing
[2:13:27] <%ryome> V needs Urizen to gain power (so he can recombine) but he also needs Urizen to be weakened/not too powerful or he would refuse to reform Virgil. V is actually trying to hamstring Dante by bringing Nero along, because he knows that Dante will hesitate if Nero has to kill his father. That’s my theory.
[2:13:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @unkle_sterben Maybe so. But you can guess as much when V says Urizen took Nero's arm. Then seeing the flashback when he lost it.
[2:13:34] <%hawk_rush> more cutscenes woo
[2:13:34] <waifoong98> LUL
[2:13:35] <bsmusic> it fully charges if you hold it
[2:13:36] <%nitronLVIII> EEEEEEEEE
[2:13:36] <Tha_Mik> LUL
[2:13:36] <%Jetsfantasy> Book charges past 3 bars

[2:13:39] <b_ikki> amazing
[2:13:40] <blaze8423> YEAH
[2:13:41] <joshuaoverheaven> DMC really stands for Do More Combo
[2:13:41] <%Ion_Laser> LUL
[2:13:41] <absolute_cagemony> the 3 bars is just to let you know thats how much you need for nightmare
[2:13:42] <SnaKemuho> DO IT
[2:13:42] <%lloyddboy> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:13:42] <waifoong98> CAW CAW LUL
[2:13:43] <aimlesshealer> @ryome I disagree completely
[2:13:44] <Jermatoo> @AngriestPat The only deal I know with V's book is that you get faster charge the closer you are to enemies while reading it.
[2:13:45] <Idon__> THAT SHITTY BIRD
[2:13:47] <Artista_AF> LUL
[2:13:48] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Not better combo, BIGGER COMBO
[2:13:48] <%MagickBurritoh> YEYEYE
[2:13:49] <krksobk> wiggly boys
[2:13:50] <%alexandrecau> V as a bloody palace boss would be weird, like does he heal the other summons?
[2:13:50] <ravencloak13> Was that a Dante figure?
[2:13:54] <blackflame> wtf is this?
[2:13:57] <juxtest> ~o~
[2:13:59] <SyncNet> LUL
[2:13:59] <damdash16> Who we expecting first to become playable?

[2:14:00] <+SimplyPandaz> I hate it but i love it
[2:14:00] <person181> "quick be a squid"
[2:14:01] <%The_Esquana> I would pay for them to give griffon a dedicated quip button
[2:14:02] <Huntercd> Did Pat already beat the game?
[2:14:02] <PrinceOfEden> @SyncNet @AngriestPat It keeps charging as long as you hold it while there is an enemy in a non weakened state in combat.
[2:14:03] <dukenux> That imterpretative dance
[2:14:06] <RantingRavager> ~o~
[2:14:06] <waifoong98> holyshit
[2:14:10] <%Divryne> SWEET MOVES.
[2:14:11] <%Divryne> BAKA.
[2:14:12] <loveless10> dmc is about drug adictition and it affect on a family and the world

[2:14:14] <%ThePuddingDead> hiss
[2:14:15] <%joylent_blue> Huntercd yes this is Son of Sparda difficulty

[2:14:19] <$KnivesEve> that birb is reat
[2:14:22] <Splatterfest> what is this hahaha?
[2:14:22] <$KnivesEve> great
[2:14:23] <%masneo2> how did they do this without laughing?
[2:14:25] <ravencloak13> @blackflame After beating the game you can unlock behind the scenes versions of how they mocap shit for the cutscenes
[2:14:29] <SyncNet> great thanks @PrinceOfEden
[2:14:30] <%claudesavegely> fuckin sleeve tatoos
[2:14:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It's called acting
[2:14:36] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @Sphincter_Spelunker I agree, I anything short of a pureblood demon would be overwhelmed by the fruit and die. He needed to split himself and then recombine to attain true powet
[2:14:37] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Is that the dance of his people?
[2:14:40] <joshuaoverheaven> i spent an hour last night just watching these deluxe edition cutscenes lmao
[2:14:40] <%joylent_blue> this isn't mocap, this is storyboard stuff
[2:14:42] <waifoong98> man this is some tokusatsu shit right here LUL
[2:14:44] <absolute_cagemony> The Japanese are strong, they can fight the laughter within.
[2:14:44] <D3rrtyD4n> take that nidhogg
[2:14:44] <Idon__> That's such a strong line.
[2:14:45] <%alexandrecau> @masneo2 it's called being professional
[2:14:47] <Jermatoo> @ravencloak13 I thought the previz cutscenes were dlc only?
[2:14:49] <SnaKemuho> @masneo2 dozens of takes probably
[2:14:49] <Idon__> Blake master trash-talker
[2:14:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> whoa
[2:14:52] <%MagickBurritoh> Birdman really carries it
[2:14:54] <%ThePuddingDead> i kinda like this theme
[2:14:54] <AlasterAngelo> these are the legit cutscenes Capcom ran out of budget
[2:14:56] <b_ikki> yeah this fight sucks
[2:14:57] <wsintai> @Sphincter_Spelunker I was about to agree with you, then I saw the bird guy flapping his arms and started giggling
[2:14:57] <bsmusic> I honestly wish it was the mocap
[2:15:03] <Clyderso> V's boss theme SourPls
[2:15:04] <%masneo2> if that's the case i'd like to see the outtakes
[2:15:05] <freedomboyz> i love that they use DMC4 music
[2:15:09] <ravencloak13> @jermatoo What DLC? Haven’t heard of any of that.
[2:15:12] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @AngriestPat get ready this boss molly wopped me on SoS
[2:15:14] <aimlesshealer> Did y'all not see how shocked and afraid V was when he got separated from Vergil? It wasn't some kind of master plan to be recombined in the end
[2:15:17] <jubejube56> lol it is hard to say that V's writing is bad when half his dialogue is quoting good poets
[2:15:22] <nox_nyctores> I had to this fight in DMD with 4 Hp bars... that took some time
[2:15:23] <Jermatoo> @ravencloak13 It's dlc that's a part of the Deluxe Edition.
[2:15:25] <b_ikki> g r o o v y
[2:15:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But Dante is stronger than Mundus and Mundus ate the fruit. No Dante should be able to eat the fruit without splitting
[2:15:26] <%TheFilth> I've found that putting DT into griffon or Shadow ends up giving me more than I invested back
[2:15:28] <$valriot> Just use Domination when hes down, its fuckin busted
[2:15:33] <aimlesshealer> The only reason he did that was because Urizen lost, he learned family values from Nero, and he would've died otherwise
[2:15:36] <absolute_cagemony> dis boss easy on SoS, Pat gonna wallop it
[2:15:36] <imquotin> God fucking damn Pat for being able to play this as a living
[2:15:38] <%gnarly_memes_bro> oh no hes gonna make me look like trash isnt he
[2:15:38] <AlasterAngelo> Who is V's Style announcer?
[2:15:40] <waifoong98> this fight gives me DMC2 Hydra boss fight vibe LUL
[2:15:48] <imquotin> mortals have to work and can't play DMC5 all the time
[2:15:48] <santystuffs> Use the autopilot more
[2:15:50] <ravencloak13> @alasterangelo Sounds like Nico.
[2:15:51] <%lewdskeletor13> People who think V had some master plan lack viewing comprehension
[2:15:51] <Artista_AF> i hope Vergil gets to keep Griphon, he's too fantastic LUL
[2:15:53] <+Sp3ctre48> I love Griffon so much
[2:15:54] <b_ikki> why griffin gotta bully
[2:16:01] <dukenux> No, Vergil straight up "reject his humanity" to become stronger. V was the side effect of that
[2:16:02] <th3madness> BIRD AND CAAAT
[2:16:03] <absolute_cagemony> Read more and Juice more!
[2:16:12] <%ThePuddingDead> if that va the same guy that did those berserker psychos from BL2?
[2:16:16] <damdash16> Vergil should drop with bloody palace
[2:16:18] <Prism_Wing> B I R D AND C A T
[2:16:21] <LtThunderbolt> Nidhog sounds like the goliaths from Borderlands2
[2:16:22] <sappinmahbinyot> Griffon is so rude D:
[2:16:25] <theobble> shut the fuck up elmoooo
[2:16:26] <%ThePuddingDead> the ones where u shoot their helmet and they lose their shit
[2:16:28] <waifoong98> over conclusion, Dragon's Dogma did Hydra the best Kappa
[2:16:29] <Brackleforth> is every boss in this game an immobile fortress type?
[2:16:33] <blackorchidKI2> Vergil pulling a Dio
[2:16:34] <b_ikki> no
[2:16:34] <+mondumbra> hi what difficulty is this?
[2:16:35] <%joylent_blue> datamines suggest Vergil WILL drop with BP
[2:16:36] <$valriot> Griffon sassy boy
[2:16:39] <%TheFilth> The Vergil that comes back has the combined experiences of V and Urizen
[2:16:40] <%lewdskeletor13> @brackleforth No
[2:16:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mundus ate the fruit when he ruled. Dante fought him when he was on his way back after 2000 years
[2:16:42] <benjiFG> is that the voice of the goliaths from Borderlands 2
[2:16:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah but instead of just separating his weak human side he basically lost his memory and soul
[2:16:44] <waifoong98> @Brackleforth not all but a lot
[2:16:45] <PrinceOfEden> I hate that dodging with V gets rid of the current charge you have.
[2:16:45] <stirlingw17> i hate that if you double jump you lose giffions charge
[2:16:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Shut up, anime
[2:16:49] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @dukenux that doesn't necesarily mean recombining after he ate the as urizen wasn't also part of his plan
[2:16:59] <absolute_cagemony> gg ez
[2:16:59] <joshuaoverheaven> when does BP come out?
[2:17:01] <PrinceOfEden> @stirlingw17 Yep, literally typed it at the same time.
[2:17:04] <aimlesshealer> @dukenux but the human part of him, V, regretted that. V wasn't on board witht he power quest
[2:17:04] <Ir_ramble> damn niddhogg and his egotesticles
[2:17:05] <b_ikki> april
[2:17:06] <PrinceOfEden> Same with Shadow
[2:17:07] <%joylent_blue> joshuaoverheaven next month
[2:17:08] <Brackleforth> alright, I've seen like 5 already, not that theyre bad tho
[2:17:12] <santystuffs> I don't want to get everyone's hopes up, but the "playable" Vergil is literally just the AI controlled on Dante's credits section
[2:17:13] <b_ikki> this fight on dmd sucks ass
[2:17:22] <%alexandrecau> @Brackleforth no, gerydon and cavalier angelo are pretty mobile, urizen ultimate is moving too
[2:17:23] <b_ikki> yeyey

[2:19:05] <+Sp3ctre48> He's a big guy
[2:19:06] <aimlesshealer> Before he split himself, Vergil thought he could finally achieve his goals without his humanity holding him back. He thought Urizen could do it. The intention was never to recombine later down the line

[2:20:28] <stirlingw17> Awaken my Masters!
[2:20:35] <%Konquerer> i beat urizen in the prologue on SoS so i could skip to DMD
[2:20:41] <wolfykinzplaytime> weeeee
[2:20:42] <Brutal_Defeat> Do you get the super costumes if you beat urizen on dmd?
[2:20:49] <lizard0tm> Cool as Shadow, Griffon and Nightmare are, I wish V had other demons too
[2:20:51] <%joylent_blue> feels like they should be doing more damage to you
[2:20:53] <SnaKemuho> @brutal_defeat no
[2:21:08] <stingray53_1> I wish V got to control Phantom
[2:21:08] <Ner234> @AngriestPat have you ever used a buster attack on a Fury (The super fast enemy) ? It's hype.
[2:21:16] <aimlesshealer> @gnarly_memes_bro Why would Vergil want his humanity back after removing it?
[2:21:23] <DeebzNutz100> V spin off game
[2:21:25] <stirlingw17> does anyone ever use the dt griffon or shadow?
[2:21:30] <CaptainFrankincense> chaos legion 2
[2:21:31] <alrobot2014> vergil accidentally cut himself apart again oopsie doopsie
[2:21:31] <dekkitout> V: I got better
[2:21:36] <+Sp3ctre48> They kept his book, he'll probably be back
[2:21:36] <Megapikman132> "oh no, Virgil fell on the Yamato
[2:21:38] <waifoong98> They could just give this moveset to somebody else since V doesn't do much really
[2:21:39] <KeroKamina> Nero has to find the power of wakign to get V back
[2:21:42] <Jermatoo> @AngriestPat Have you seen the meme image that shows V as Kylo Ren, Jack Frost as Nero, and the old cop from Too Human as Dante LUL
[2:21:43] <jubejube56> are demon inputs based off where V stands to the enemy or where the demon stands?
[2:21:43] <%arbiduck> I bet they'll use his character "type" for something in Dragon's Dogma 2 honestly
[2:21:46] <+KhonsuII> I'm hoping they put a beast master class into dragons dogma 2 that plays like V
[2:21:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Just make Lucia new V
[2:21:48] <KaptainKappathe5th> if i had to guess we'll probably get a character that does what v does that isnt actually v
[2:21:53] <dukenux> DLC?
[2:21:54] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Just make him a character in DmC 2
[2:21:55] <Firesparks> so do they explain how dante got out of hell from dmc2?
[2:22:08] <b_ikki> @Firesparks yeah he just found a portal
[2:22:08] <%lewdskeletor13> They could just have Vergil use a style similar to V’s gameplay @angriestpat
[2:22:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Firesparks A hole appeared and he went through it
[2:22:09] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @aimlesshealer I believe the whole point was that he needed to split himself in two because nothing less than a pure demon could survive the Qliphoth fruit
[2:22:09] <jetvillain> in prequel novel, yes
[2:22:09] <%joylent_blue> Firesparks the prequel novel does
[2:22:10] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> V is so fun to play I'd be perfectly cool with them making a bullshit reason for him to stick around
[2:22:11] <SnaKemuho> @firesparks the only DMC2 reference is a knife in a map
[2:22:11] <Valeria1080> What difficulty is Pat playing on?
[2:22:16] <dukenux> just make V do something between the separation and this
[2:22:16] <+Sp3ctre48> no because DMC2 doesnt matter
[2:22:17] <%lloyddboy> SoS
[2:22:18] <DeebzNutz100> Clocked out
[2:22:19] <bsmusic> LUL LUL
[2:22:20] <masso101> They could just kingdom hearts it, multiple versions of Vergil can exist at the same time
[2:22:20] <person181> the anime is more present than 2 is
[2:22:21] <Toxic_Phazon> so he pulled kratos
[2:22:22] <SnakeBelmont> Vergil never lost the yamato so he could still stab himself for V
[2:22:23] <Megapikman132> something Balrog did
[2:22:23] <waifoong98> @Firesparks prob the same way they will leave after this game nleh
[2:22:23] <Animal_Farm4> He drove through a portal. It''s in the prequel novel
[2:22:24] <KeroKamina> i think it's explainedi n the novel
[2:22:26] <SnaKemuho> LUCIA MATTERS
[2:22:26] <%sshen> read the japanese only book
[2:22:26] <Idon__> The Order's experiments with the Yamato opened a portal big enough for him to get out iirc.
[2:22:28] <santystuffs> 4 HOURS PLACE Pogchamp
[2:22:29] <redsynod> He just left
[2:22:29] <%joylent_blue> its SORTA implied a shard of yamato was the cause
[2:22:31] <Megapikman132> They mention it like, once in the novel
[2:22:32] <theobble> he said no and left
[2:22:32] <$NocturneNovember> Yeah, Dante just walked through a random portal and got back home
[2:22:33] <KeroKamina> Lucia's atleast explainedi n the novel
[2:22:34] <%hawk_rush> it's in the prequel novel
[2:22:38] <Neo_Kaiser> I hope Pat shows everyone the Secret Mission right up ahead.
[2:22:38] <chaadwyck> Hey Pat, wholesome question, how's your day been?
[2:22:39] <%Halowood> They explain in the prequel novel Balrog was making portals out with a shard of the Yamato and Dante stumbled on one
[2:22:41] <dukenux> He got bored
[2:22:43] <%a_confused_girlscout> Just got here and I'm so happy to see EX V
[2:22:43] <%NWR_James> he called an uber
[2:22:46] <stirlingw17> how did dante get out of hell? it's simple we just made it not cannon anymore
[2:22:48] <aimlesshealer> @gnarly_memes_bro That would make sense, but I don't recall that being said in game. But I was very tired when I played it
[2:22:49] <+PrincessLuna85> where is it in the settings to turn on live action cutscenes
[2:22:54] <%alexandrecau> who the fuck is gonna stop him? Like all the demons likely teamed up to open a portl so dante get the fuck out
[2:22:56] <sappinmahbinyot> @Halowood Thanks Balrog :)
[2:22:57] <waifoong98> I swear they are just going to make magical portals again after this game ending
[2:22:57] <damdash16> They gotta pull a roxas or trish even
[2:23:01] <DeebzNutz100> DMC 2 doesn't deserve a Remake but it does need a redo
[2:23:08] <+KaiserCrimson_1> I always assumed that the ending of DMC Nocturne explained that: as in once the world got remade, he just kinda went home since his job was done
[2:23:12] <%hawk_rush> @PrincessLuna85 it's only available fi you have the deluxe edition
[2:23:17] <+BorinCorran> tfw the anime is more canon than DMC2.
[2:23:17] <%lewdskeletor13> You literally hear him get out of hell in DMC 2, it was never gonna be important
[2:23:18] <+eskman10> What’s up pat
[2:23:22] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat so have you figured what does damaging the legs do here?
[2:23:31] <rumblebunni> @AngriestPat You know with those being Grim Gripe points, I wonder if there was going to be an option to have different characters in each stage.
[2:23:32] <Artista_AF> i would love if they remade the whole franchise with 5's quality of life improvements
[2:23:37] <%sshen> I mean they already have the sword that can cut open portals so I don't think they need to do much
[2:23:49] <+ZenVulgarity> @AngriestPat Are you still used to the cursing at all? That still throws me off playing through it again.
[2:23:55] <Idon__> DMC3 in the RE2 Engine would be Kreygasm
[2:23:55] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @aimless it wasn't im just speculating. i understand this series has a very "if you didn't see it it didn't happen" attitue but im willing to believe vergil is smart enough to plan all of this
[2:23:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Open a portal then Gerault walks through
[2:24:00] <+PrincessLuna85> ah well crap thanks @hawk_rush
[2:24:04] <damdash16> His cane was doing some crazy shit in the familiar fight
[2:24:06] <Animal_Farm4> I think damaging the legs here determines how many of the legs are available to be gripped in the Gilgamesh fight from the start
[2:24:09] <Firesparks> it's strange how both Leon and Dante got a new game to make them relevant again
[2:24:14] <%joylent_blue> Nero's cursing felt pretty normal to me
[2:24:22] <waifoong98> Buff your pets even more, I mean you have the whole DT bar there.
[2:24:38] <Idon__> The difference is Leon got younger and Dante got older, lol.
[2:24:39] <+TheQButton> the die in one hit modes must be so much harder with V cuz you have more to keep track of.
[2:24:43] <%a_confused_girlscout> I've seen some people compare this Nero with Dino, and it makes me sad
[2:24:44] <sappinmahbinyot> Nero cursed in DMC4, too, right?
[2:24:50] <+Mattmatatt> why not use all dat DT
[2:24:51] <%lewdskeletor13> You hear Dante’s motorcycle at the end of 2, meaning he ALREADY got out. It was never gonna be an important plot point @angriestpat
[2:24:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat saves his DT like he saves gunpowder elixers
[2:24:59] <Artista_AF> i dunno, the Sparda family swearing is off-putting but everyone else is fair fucking game
[2:24:59] <%TheFilth> I always buff the pet I'm not trying to do something specific with since the AI can take over
[2:25:02] <Idon__> He did flip the bird, but I don't remember the f-bomb.
[2:25:05] <waifoong98> @sappinmahbinyot I guess his middle finger counts
[2:25:08] <SpaceGuntank> vee
[2:25:09] <PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat Wait until the Furies, hope you can GitGud with parries. They are the main enemy who gave me trouble on SoS.

[2:25:20] <stirlingw17> ah yes i don't like fighting him on devil trigger either
[2:25:24] <nox_nyctores> 🅱️
[2:25:26] <LtThunderbolt> 4 hours
[2:25:29] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Nero cursed during his combos in 4.
[2:25:33] <+Bad1uck> !uptime
[2:25:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 25m.
[2:25:37] <aimlesshealer> @gnarly_memes_bro To me it seems more consistent with Vergil's character to attempt to discard his humanity altogether, since he embraced his demon side in contrast to Dante. But yeah, good discussions all around :)
[2:25:38] <%TheFilth> @PrinceOfEden I misread that as furries
[2:25:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Also DMC 2 takes place 10 years before this game
[2:25:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @imquotin Would assume not much. He followed up by wondering how a binge format would work
[2:25:50] <$valriot> Royal Release all the Fury enemies
[2:25:54] <Idon__> sextuple shank
[2:25:56] <LtThunderbolt> nero did curse in 4 i forgot about that
[2:26:05] <Artista_AF> i might have to revisit 4 to see if Nero actually swears or not
[2:26:08] <PrinceOfEden> Yeah, they port around and are unhitible for half the fight until you parry them or punish. It's basically the only time I really use royal guard.
[2:26:21] <harrfuzz> i've been spamming Red Queen B and Balrog fist mode to deal with furies in my SoS LUL
[2:26:26] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @aimlesshealer i like to think that he wanted to throw it away entirely, but V stayed behind because deep in his subconcious he knew it made him better
[2:26:27] <fairore> do you know if vergil down you in the fight and you get back up hes says how da fuck
[2:26:31] <waifoong98> So did Vergil literally turned into a Valstrax by the end of this game?
[2:26:36] <absolute_cagemony> Trickster works great on Furys, as does le motorcycle
[2:26:48] <%joylent_blue> i've had some TERRIBLE photos LUL
[2:26:52] <Idon__> bad photo, but cool animation
[2:26:55] <%MelBrooksKA> It's fine
[2:26:56] <+Exyoh> Suddenly the lyrics of V's song make narrative sense
[2:26:57] <%joylent_blue> one was just Nero's shoe
[2:26:58] <yeayeadewey> is he playing claw?
[2:26:59] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @aimlesshealer like his subconcious made the plan sorta
[2:27:07] <Firesparks> remember when people joke how raiden is cooler than dante? when revengence came again, what a difference 5 years make
[2:27:13] <+Andrizzleton> one of my photos was Shadow taking up 90% of the image so it was essentially just all black
[2:27:22] <+6695HC> honestly I can see it being a plan vergil had in order to make his demon side stronger before coming together again since vergil is THE MASTER of "You didn't win!"
[2:27:22] <%drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat do you think the Hell Judecca are inspired by the Dreamrunners from DmC: Devil May Cry?
[2:27:35] <%lewdskeletor13> If you think V is some mastermind his whole arc in this game went over your head
[2:27:46] <joshuaoverheaven> Pin ‘em to the wall
[2:27:47] <theobble> you'll never beat Pokemon snap at this rate
[2:27:58] <LtThunderbolt> bahaha
[2:28:00] <%MagickBurritoh> HAH
[2:28:01] <tearsaurther> I love V, he was a surprise good character
[2:28:02] <%joylent_blue> woaw
[2:28:03] <PrinceOfEden> @Andrizzleton I can beat that, one of my photos was in the subway, dude fell down the escalator so it literally zoomed into the floor. Solid black.
[2:28:06] <%jiin6> LUL
[2:28:17] <$highrollermlp> cheer100 Woo! rare time i'm off work to watch the stream have some bits, and keep being hilarious.
[2:28:18] <PrinceOfEden> It was sad, but I laughed for a bit.
[2:28:26] <jubejube56> gotta say comboing enemies towards V so youu can stab them without moving is pretty satisfying
[2:28:26] <takokasa> waow
[2:28:26] <benjiFG> oh lawd she comin
[2:28:28] <Snake1337one> those red bois are like nigh impossible on DMD, especially with V
[2:28:28] <Idon__> no live action :(
[2:28:29] <dukenux> waow
[2:28:32] <%lloyddboy> WOW
[2:28:33] <LtThunderbolt> THICC
[2:28:33] <FenixSeraph> Too bad this cutscene isn't live action
[2:28:34] <%Ganerumo> Griffon sounds a lot like jafar's parrot the more I listen to it.
[2:28:37] <%a_confused_girlscout> Green V looks so good, oml
[2:28:40] <sarg1010> Where's the live action for this guy???
[2:28:43] <waifoong98> Locus kills
[2:28:46] <FenixSeraph> Would love to see a guy just licking the floor the whole time
[2:28:48] <LtThunderbolt> my QUEEN
[2:28:48] <Idon__> I wanted to see a guy with two brooms
[2:28:51] <%TheMilhouseExperience> YASS QUEEN
[2:28:56] <%lewdskeletor13> @ganerumo I feel like it was intentional
[2:28:56] <dukenux> Green V like a LOTR extra
[2:29:10] <%alexandrecau> like you fought those three levels ago on sos
[2:29:20] <imquotin> SAVIOR
[2:29:24] <waifoong98> who is the announcer?
[2:29:30] <benjiFG> nico
[2:29:30] <%lewdskeletor13> Nico
[2:29:30] <%joylent_blue> i don't like nico's announcer voice LUL
[2:29:33] <waifoong98> ooh
[2:29:35] <filialpails> QUEEN
[2:29:38] <petiskoide> but there aren't live actions for enemy introductions are there? at least not for the empusas
[2:29:40] <%lloyddboy> QUEEN
[2:29:42] <+JavaManJoJo> did Nico just say "super sexy, sexy"?
[2:29:43] <Rhide1> KILLER QUEEN
[2:29:43] <%Konquerer> that's my exact picture for that one
[2:29:46] <%TheFilth> Morrison for Dante isn't much better
[2:29:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Is Nico the only alternate style announcer? I thought the 3 characters would have different ones
[2:29:49] <damdash16> Guys imagine in DMC5SE they go all out and give us flashback missions with lucia, credo, and arkham?
[2:29:50] <The_Cysquatch> Dynamite with a laser beam.
[2:29:55] <benjiFG> I wish Nico said "ahyuck" in her announcements
[2:30:01] <DeebzNutz100> ♫She's a Killer Queen Gunpowder, gelatin Dynamite with a laser beam Guaranteed to blow your mind ♫
[2:30:01] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @Sphincter_Spelunker dante gets morrison
[2:30:02] <stirlingw17> Killer Queen, Bits the Dusto!
[2:30:03] <dukenux> Guarantee to blow your mind
[2:30:04] <%jiin6> She's a killer, do not die
[2:30:05] <waifoong98> Just gimme the Marvel 3 guy Kappa
[2:30:07] <blackorchidKI2> Dante has Morrison
[2:30:08] <PrinceOfEden> @Sphincter_Spelunker Dante has morrison I think
[2:30:11] <%nitronLVIII> Guaranteed to blow your mind
[2:30:17] <person181> imagen if virgel did the callout thing for V
[2:30:24] <$XeroSigmaPrime> @damdash16 No, thats like... unnecessary?
[2:30:28] <dukenux> Anytiiiiiiiiiime
[2:30:40] <alrobot2014> oooh recommended at the price
[2:30:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> But V also shares Nico? Not the threesome I imagined
[2:30:42] <%joylent_blue> i would definitely want to hear Vergil say "smoking sexy style"
[2:30:45] <%Tyonidus> big D E M O N
[2:30:46] <%alexandrecau> oh yes gerydon is gonna kill you pets if you aren't careful
[2:30:48] <%a_confused_girlscout> Did we ever actually hear a "SCUM" from V?
[2:30:48] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @person181 it'd make sense but thar=t would have been a huuuge spoiler for a preorder bonus
[2:30:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Vergil better recite some poetry in 6
[2:30:51] <bsmusic> @person181 kind of a big spoiler if that was the case
[2:30:52] <emillionghost> HeyGuys HeyGuys
[2:30:55] <joshuaoverheaven> tbh i miss combat adjudicators, they were a fun way of getting blorb fragments
[2:30:58] <harrfuzz> Weird question possibly. How do you get the Gilgamesh Cutscene where V helps as V? Can you? Ive seen myself pop up for the gost data before
[2:30:59] <$valriot> Yeah this boss is my least favourite
[2:31:10] <BaronVonWidget> B A L L E R
[2:31:12] <$anime_boyz> using shadows skewer move one shots the bulbs in the roots
[2:31:13] <%joylent_blue> scum is nero's word
[2:31:21] <imquotin> "split myself in two"
[2:31:34] <lizard0tm> I'm sad we never got V fighting Urizen at all
[2:31:36] <%joylent_blue> nobodies can go fuck themselves
[2:31:39] <%wolfofsound> I keep hearing metallica in that lyrics "How I'm killing youuuuuu"
[2:31:49] <+nikoninja19> dude what the FFFFF i havent seen one bit of gameplay from this game.. looks dope
[2:31:58] <theobble> r e s t I n p e a s
[2:31:59] <damdash16> Yea your right vergil, lady an trish revamped are enough
[2:31:59] <absolute_cagemony> V's theme reminds me of Jane's Addiction
[2:31:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> God, Nightmare even busts through like a hollow from Hueco Mundo. Stop making me miss the trash that was Bleach
[2:32:00] <waifoong98> Damn Birkin lickers
[2:32:01] <%TheFilth> chaining finishers with V is one of the best feelings
[2:32:02] <Turbocommand> Goth soundwave, laserbeak, and Ravage go alligator hunting in spooky sewers
[2:32:08] <PrinceOfEden> I love that taunt so much
[2:32:10] <+AhmCha> I still haven't figured out how to deal with the Nobody's quickly
[2:32:12] <%lloyddboy> TWIRL
[2:32:14] <PrinceOfEden> Since it's air to ground
[2:32:18] <PrinceOfEden> It's beautiful
[2:32:21] <imquotin> savior bloodstain hellfire shadow
[2:32:30] <%lewdskeletor13> They should give Vergil a summoning style in the next game
[2:32:31] <%Tyonidus> Yeah I hate those things, like you said in woolie's lp enemies that don't take hitstun in these games are awful
[2:32:32] <MeowmereArt> @AhmCha yeah, and what the fuck is about their mask, cant figure that out.
[2:32:34] <Janglebelly> it bothers me that the screen says Smokin Sexy Style butthe voicesays Super Sexy Sexy
[2:32:49] <DeebzNutz100> Bloody palace cant get here soon enough
[2:32:51] <%joylent_blue> they are the FUCKING STRONG
[2:32:52] <%nitronLVIII> They are the fucking strong
[2:32:56] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @Sphincter_Spelunker duude those last couple of years of bleach were rough
[2:33:00] <alwayspronking> Just use a keyblade 4Head 4Head
[2:33:07] <Videogamer4> nobody's on dmd are they fucking worst
[2:33:10] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @Sphincter_Spelunker but that trash juice was so sweet
[2:33:17] <Prism_Wing> @alwayspronking ha
[2:33:17] <%cappyd33> is pat playing this on son of sparda?
[2:33:21] <%joylent_blue> yes
[2:33:22] <%Mikatonic> Random question: are secret missions affected by game difficulty?
[2:33:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Yup
[2:33:25] <%TheMilhouseExperience> It’s like they were an elite enemy in their own game.
[2:33:27] <%KaironFortressKnight> how do we unlock V's color?
[2:33:27] <%wolfofsound> @gnarly_memes_bro just wanted more Zaraki and I got it
[2:33:27] <%joylent_blue> yep Mikatonic
[2:33:34] <DeebzNutz100> si pat working on the 3 million?
[2:33:37] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat actually someone datamined it, apparently nobodies have 3000 hp AND resistance to ALL damage
[2:33:40] <+PabloGuy51> V is pretty sick.
[2:33:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @gnarly_memes_bro It looked cool. FeelsBadMan Even got my hopes up for Burn The Witch
[2:33:44] <%TheFilth> Behemoths, Hell Judeca's, Nobodies and Furies, and the big goat bois are essentially mini-bosses
[2:33:47] <BigCoffee> Isn't it kinda strange to make a new character and it's the least played in the game?
[2:33:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Nah
[2:33:59] <%Mikatonic> @joylent_blue so you have to re-clear them as well. Oh jeez
[2:34:04] <%Tyonidus> I like V okay but he's still definitely my least favorite. Can't decide if I like Nero or Dante better.
[2:34:04] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @wolfofsound that was probably the last good part of the series
[2:34:09] <absolute_cagemony> using Trickster vs Furies leads to some anime shit
[2:34:13] <Spiderfacev> You're getting WAY more orbs on SoS
[2:34:14] <waifoong98> @BigCoffee not that strange, some new character in Musou game sucksssss
[2:34:19] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Baphomets are pussies.
[2:34:21] <+AhmCha> Do they have a parry point or anything?
[2:34:24] <%wolfofsound> @gnarly_memes_bro but what if I used............TWO HANDS
[2:34:24] <CopperTucker> man this game looks gorgeous
[2:34:26] <BigCoffee> Also where is it explained how Virgil came back? You kill him in 3, and then his shadow self in 1, he's not in 2, and not in 4.
[2:34:26] <LtThunderbolt> joy and merth
[2:34:26] <%joylent_blue> Mikatonic ? once you clear them on any difficulty they're permanently cleared

[2:35:57] <%alexandrecau> @BigCoffee V mentions he was barely alive by the time he found Nero and yanked the arm, he kept sucking demon juice in the hope he stayed alive after being freed from mundus

[2:36:12] <Pat_Squared> @BigCoffee well he doesn't die in 3, he just get stuck in hell. As to how he lived from blowing up as Nelo Angelo, its just kinda assumes he just barely survived
[2:36:13] <Idon__> Lol, nightmare just punched geryon
[2:36:15] <Firesparks> has pat beat this game already? can we post spoiler?
[2:36:18] <%TheMilhouseExperience> *granblue fantasy
[2:36:22] <Idon__> yeah he's beaten it
[2:36:29] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @Valdorick yeah kinda weird when you remember this is a severely displaced converation between mother and son, technically
[2:36:29] <joshuaoverheaven> several times i’m sure
[2:36:30] <%TheFilth> Impressive Vergil managed to rip Nero's arm off nearly dead
[2:36:32] <polyanambn> what difficulty is this
[2:36:32] <Nelzar> what difficulty is this?
[2:36:33] <DeebzNutz100> Calling Nightmare while he's taking a shit atpSpiner
[2:36:33] <harrfuzz> @ScatterCatt yes. You get everything and Dante gets rebellion, sparda, or DSD
[2:36:37] <SnaKemuho> @currysausebandit I can't unsee anyone after playing through with these cutscenes
[2:36:40] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s beaten it like 4 times

[2:37:13] <+AhmCha> I became so obsessed with using Double Check on Griffon that I forgot to use Blockade, which is more useful
[2:37:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Y'all need Jesus
[2:37:15] <polyanambn> doesn’t look like SoS
[2:37:17] <+6695HC> @GeneralSCPatton don't know and I never plan on finding out
[2:37:21] <+KaiserCrimson_1> It should be remembered that Nero Angelo does the explosion thing in every fight you have with him in DMC1 btw. Totally plausible to retcon him into surviving lol
[2:37:24] <bsmusic> Bit of a hint there. Hoa would V know about time stead
[2:37:29] <polyanambn> the boss is doing fuck all damage

[2:38:00] <%TheMilhouseExperience> They die real fast to this boss
[2:38:02] <harrfuzz> V's reaction to the angelos in mission 7 makes a lot more sense once you know who he is

[2:38:09] <%chubbypencil> NIGHTMARE
[2:38:10] <Artista_AF> alas you can't beat just the Knight & keep the Geryon for yourself
[2:38:14] <TeamDattony> Happy Birthday Pat \ mioCRY /
[2:38:14] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @bsmusic i mean V's level of knowledge in general was a point of contention before this point, it just reinforces that
[2:38:14] <Idon__> Just do what KH does and put him in a replica body, EZ.
[2:38:25] <polyanambn> @bsmusic that’s such a good point
[2:38:28] <aimlesshealer> @wolfofsound DLC taunt for V
[2:38:29] <absolute_cagemony> "Hey Virgil... we miss V, can you stab yourself and separate again for like...an hour or so?"
[2:38:35] <bsmusic> @alexandrecau I just mean it's a hint about Vergil, since he was in the tower when Dante slayed timestead
[2:38:45] <Spiderfacev> DIE
[2:38:45] <%jiin6> V's evil laugh
[2:38:46] <alwayspronking> "Die"

[2:39:11] <%Ion_Laser> LUL LUL
[2:39:13] <sarg1010> So are these live action cutscenes optional?
[2:39:15] <arcaderabbit48> V was a better dad than you, can you split in half and Dante can just kill Urizen?
[2:39:15] <%lewdskeletor13> LUL LUL
[2:39:19] <PrinceOfEden> I bet his arms are getting tired

[2:39:26] <%joylent_blue> V didn't even know Nero was his son either
[2:39:27] <JinjaBredMan> this is the absolute best

[2:39:30] <+PenmanLupine> he got paid so much money to do this
[2:39:32] <Idon__> no, you HAVE to watch these.
[2:39:34] <SnaKemuho> Shadow and Griffon DO IT
[2:39:34] <CrimsonFox777> Wish I could get paid to pretend to be a bird. :(
[2:39:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Man, Woolie's Vergil boner was like a dowsing rod to V. Just on quotes alone.
[2:39:38] <waifoong98> skin color shirt tatooed LUL
[2:39:41] <$XeroSigmaPrime> They need to release V's books filled with his quotes and poems. They actually really unique and well written
[2:39:46] <+ahegotrigger> holy shit
[2:39:47] <dero45> I’m a mutha fukn bird

[2:39:59] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Honestly I'd rather have them as a separate blu ray @AngriestPat
[2:40:01] <%hntronium> @XeroSigmaPrime Its from a real thing iirc
[2:40:03] <+ahegotrigger> I want to play through this with live action cut scenes first
[2:40:03] <Idon__> Budget May Cry.
[2:40:06] <+eskman10> Who’s the actors
[2:40:08] <Megapikman132> @XeroSigmaPrime That's because nearly all of them are real poems by William Blake
[2:40:08] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie really nailed his V prediction in the LP
[2:40:09] <Valdorick> Now I'm kinda sad we didn't get Live Action RE2 cutscenes
[2:40:11] <KaptainKappathe5th> SIP
[2:40:12] <%RageKingDomo> @XeroSigmaPrime Dude thats atual Poetry

[2:40:31] <Jermatoo> @AngriestPat He's actually drinking Arizona Tea LUL
[2:40:32] <%nitronLVIII> That shit will kill ya
[2:40:34] <%skizzuto> easier to style when there's more enemies
[2:40:36] <SnaKemuho> No V don't drink that, oh no he has AirPods on
[2:40:36] <+BorinCorran> He's drinking slurm!?
[2:40:37] <%joylent_blue> that menu is so cool
[2:40:37] <krksobk> Vrility
[2:40:38] <Archmortal> It's much easier to build style on Son of Sparda tbh
[2:40:38] <ReiDuran> Oh my fucking god was it ACTUALLY VIRILITY
[2:40:38] <%NWR_James> why arent these cutscenes mandatory, clearly the better way
[2:40:39] <waifoong98> Well SOS is more engaging for once LUL
[2:40:40] <Ropcord> fuckin vergil hanging out in the van LUL
[2:40:40] <%RageKingDomo> WIlliam Blake
[2:40:42] <+JavaManJoJo> didn't you buy all the upgrades?
[2:40:43] <%gusdabus91> to be fair you have more abilities
[2:40:43] <Ir_ramble> thought he was drinking a cup from Subway
[2:40:44] <$XeroSigmaPrime> Wait WTF V is quoting William Blake?! HOLY SHIT HE IS!

[2:40:45] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat please tell me Woolie has managed to continue avoiding spoilers
[2:40:47] <Dragon_Batman> I love that screen
[2:40:47] <%Zombino924> they have more health so there's more style potential
[2:40:49] <Idon__> aww
[2:40:49] <$valriot> Enemies have more health, so you can style more
[2:40:50] <gogoszy> gnight
[2:40:51] <LtThunderbolt> ohh
[2:40:51] <polyanambn> bruh that was such a quick defeat
[2:40:51] <FenixSeraph> Maybe it's because enemies last long enough for you to rack up them Style points
[2:40:54] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I hope Woolie didn't get burnt out by the YT comments
[2:40:54] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Having more abilities does that
[2:40:55] <+TheQButton> thanks for the steam man.
[2:40:55] <%afronooch> he wont
[2:40:56] <+KaiserCrimson_1> These splash screens are the most wholesome thing ever like GOD DAMN
[2:40:57] <Artista_AF> LUL DmC confirmed canon, also very hypocrite that Vergil is the one drinking Virility
[2:40:57] <Valdorick> If enemies live longer you can style beast harder
[2:40:57] <Prevot> podcast is getting delayed for sure LUL
[2:40:57] <RantingRavager> <3 thanks for streaming friend

[2:42:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Don’t be THAT ASSHOLE
[2:42:31] <imquotin> Vergil just looks at Nero's Devil Breaker and cringes
[2:42:40] <%wolfofsound> OOF
[2:42:45] <ReiDuran> I think Woolie should play the last three missions since it's the climax.
[2:42:55] <Kirby_Sauce> CANT SUFFER
[2:42:58] <ReiDuran> Since he hasn't yet
[2:42:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> For You can sit there and charge STREAK and repeatedly punch with knuckle
[2:42:58] <$XeroSigmaPrime> If Vergil hates guns, how does he feel about his son's devil breaker?
[2:42:59] <televisedrevolting> Vergil- Hand me your magazine. Dante- No way you've got your own Vergil- Well I want yours too.
[2:43:26] <%joylent_blue> mmm
[2:43:30] <%DrFacilier> @AngriestPat wow Woolie sure is a champ for not finishing this game right away
[2:43:30] <ReiDuran> Hah, that's actually true.
[2:43:35] <aimlesshealer> I only wish Vergil and Dante had a bro hug in the end
[2:43:42] <bsmusic> aww
[2:43:45] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Oh Vergil would HATE the devil breaker

[2:46:36] <%Konquerer> it WILL happen now
[2:46:40] <SnaKemuho> somebody should mod live action Griffon, Shadow and Nightmare into the game
[2:46:43] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Crazy Talk Over Heaven just popped and someone somehow did it 4 hours ago

[2:48:41] <%gnarly_memes_bro> YEAH ITS A THING netflix is bae
[2:48:43] <SnaKemuho> @johnnymedia if you start switching around get used to resetting to default, like Rebellion, Trickster and E&I, so you don't get lost in his moveset
