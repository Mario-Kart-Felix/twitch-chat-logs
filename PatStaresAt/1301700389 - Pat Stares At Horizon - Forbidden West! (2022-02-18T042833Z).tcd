[0:17:52] <%MisterRockett> I was hoping he was alive so I could kill him.
[0:17:53] <%derpmandwn999> I don’t care much for spoilers, because my brain is wired in such a way that I will forget them mere seconds later
[0:18:00] <$PinkertonDanPie> pat have you heard of a game called Elden Ring? Seems low key interesting.
[0:18:00] <%luftraumm1> Ted Faro is basically Elon musk
[0:18:00] <%shurtal> Lance IS cool
[0:18:07] <@goose_attack_almanac> Gene is cool. Too bad he's the worst guest on the Super Beast CAst.

[0:18:37] <%ospreyworks> True
[0:18:37] <%barrakuta371> @goose_attack_almanac get me to be a guest and I'll easily be the worst guest
[0:18:37] <%MisterRockett> There's another game that has the EXACT SAME backstory as Horizon but it does it better.
[0:18:38] <%strakillias> strakillias subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Holy shit theres a new Twitch app for the LG tvs and boy it sucks bad. It won't load subscribed streams because it can't serve an ad first. I can only watch your stream if I'm logged out so it can make me watch an ad first. Great QA Twitch!
[0:18:39] <%ClericOfSparda> Cool. What does any of that mean?!
[0:18:39] <+KingKrampus> TERABITHIA...THAT IS A NAME I HAVEN'T HEARD IN YEARS
[0:18:39] <toyforus235> ted is evil because he wants money
[0:18:41] <%RetroCop87> they confirmed ties to Dark Souls
[0:18:43] <%DianaTheAscian> And then you go watch a german spy vid'
[0:18:44] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Souls games have a madlibs style storyline
[0:18:45] <%sighphers> elon musk is ted faro
[0:18:48] <%Soliloquy123> Hot pro tip: no-sell all spoilers by just having no fucking clue what's going on!
[0:18:49] <hakumaribo> streaming it is bold as fuck
[0:18:49] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS !!!
[0:18:51] <%TigerCatGo> THE ALTAR OF THE UNSEEN???
[0:18:51] <$PinkertonDanPie> you need vaati to explain the spoilers to you
[0:18:51] <%greasypete00> AND IT DOESNT MATTER BECAUDE YOU FONT KNOW
[0:18:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Ted Faro fucked up so hard that there's basically no point to the human species. If one guy can do all that, then history will always repeat and humanity is doomed
[0:18:53] <%ospreyworks> Watch out for those rocks in Terabithia
[0:18:56] <@goose_attack_almanac> The Queen of Terabithia is weak to rocks and slippery floos.
[0:19:01] <Midnight188> is it really a spoiler if its complete bullshit?
[0:19:01] <Jaysky> girldmCrime girldmCrime girldmCrime
[0:19:02] <%YakumoYomi> One of those sites where they hosted the MHW streams before launch
[0:19:03] <%Bloomingzonda> Just stream in the Artifact category on twitch
[0:19:06] <ScreamLord> Spoiling a Souls game is like trying to explain the Kingdom Hearts storyline. It does nothing
[0:19:06] <saibayadon> It's not a rime if you legally acquired it though?
[0:19:10] <%ospreyworks> @goose_attack_almanac LOL

[0:37:54] <%PrimalDweeb> Turn off motion blur
[0:37:54] <@Spydurman> NO
[0:37:55] <bakkatohri> The co-pilot thing might just be so you don't have to trade controllers with your homies if you're too lazy to keep passing it back and forth
[0:37:55] <PlumpPotatoRump> turn on motion blur
[0:37:55] <L3m0nTwi5t> No

[0:38:01] <%croxeye> motion blur is always an auto off for me, but it varies for ppl i guess lol
[0:38:03] <%XzileGaming> HORIZON figured out how to cure Tinnitus. and they arent even advertising it. amazing
[0:38:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I don't think I ever saw Motion Blur that looked good LUL

[0:38:23] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Turn off the screen and go read a book
[0:38:23] <$nameless_majin> Turn off system
[0:38:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Set FOV to minimum and turn on antialiasing
[0:38:28] <bakkatohri> Minimal HUD in Metro: Exodus is THE WORST, because you don't know WHAT MORAL CHOICES YOU'RE PICKING
[0:38:29] <%Taisuru> I've only played one game where turning off motion blur was vital
[0:38:29] <%MelBrooksKA> you don't need to see motion blur to know it's shit
[0:38:31] <%Broand> pritty
[0:38:32] <cpt_langosta> looks alright to me
[0:38:33] <%PrimalDweeb> Motion blur is criminal
[0:38:35] <%RonaldMcDownload> no, MORE motion blur
[0:38:35] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I remember asking Cory Barlog why GoW didn't have button mapping on Twitter and he blocked me

[0:38:44] <%CisealNine> Fun fact: I never played the original because someone was a prick about it. It is likely a great game, but I lost interest after that.

[0:38:56] <GhoulishCripple> I think the spitting poison part is why it's corrupted
[0:38:57] <tanarath> LUL

[0:39:24] <+poordoughboy> i love being very abrasive, especially at the movie theater
[0:39:24] <$nameless_majin> Aloy's new beard looks great
[0:39:25] <hereiam407> That sucks
[0:39:26] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> Not all of them were for terraforming, some of them are for breaking everything down in case the terraforming gets fucked
[0:39:27] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat It actually really thought out. they put in real detailed
[0:39:29] <%SABiscotti> some sort of Cyber Blight
[0:39:31] <%TerpanderLux> NOOOOO
[0:39:32] <Polyceramic> noooooo bb fox
[0:39:36] <+YharnamNighthawk> SIVA!

[0:39:49] <valhallandoates> the animals need more RAM
[0:39:53] <+RushUnplugged> @Samuel412 No, they're programmed to scrub the land clean so that it can be rebuilt, HADES just doesn't have the instructions to understand it needs to stop because it already happened

[0:40:01] <EynoStiles> It seems like human always causing the problem
[0:40:01] <%chiazam> @patstaresat Interesting fact about those Dinos in the desert that surprised you, the AI system designing robots for terraforming was sad about the extinction of megafauna
[0:40:02] <Treasure_Vault> Wonder how weak you'll start, compared to the end of 1
[0:40:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> I bet Aloy is the backup
[0:40:06] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I believe Hephaestus the A.I that was in charge of making the robots got mad at humans killing his robots and started making ones built for battle (This is touched on in HZD

[0:49:04] <AtisutoCurry> What the fuck am i looking at
[0:49:04] <%BigCoffee> we can,t see it
[0:49:04] <%RetroCop87> Paige sees the world at 24FPS
[0:49:04] <xinexes> nothing happened
[0:49:05] <Jontman42> SHE CAN'T SEE OVER 30 FPS
[0:49:05] <%Broand> you're marrying a 15fpser
[0:49:05] <vicar_anat> Its the fabled FPS-blinded!
[0:49:05] <TheMostAverageGamer4> barely a differance
[0:49:05] <%PatNTheHat> .....I also can't see it
[0:49:05] <r0termond> lol
[0:49:06] <hereiam407> Its so much smoother here
[0:49:06] <TheAntiNihilist> Can’t see
[0:49:06] <jtsoppy137> she needs Madness insight
[0:49:06] <+HitmanBillson> the stutter was horrific haha
[0:49:06] <@QueequegTheater> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[0:49:08] <Manwad> her eyes are UNCLOUDED by MAXIMUM GAMING
[0:49:08] <fatalDestiny> It basically cuts the frame rate in half,
[0:49:09] <%chiazam> I can’t see it
[0:49:10] <HeroToxiko> Screen RUPTURING
[0:49:11] <%DianaTheAscian> YOUR NOT ALONE PAIGE
[0:49:12] <hakumaribo> the frame rate tanks
[0:49:13] <%blastyoboots> Frame rate
[0:49:14] <%debugdrawray_> it doesnt show up well on stream tbh
[0:49:14] <IntrepidEye> She doesn't have the framerate insight
[0:49:17] <Guigondi> I CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE
[0:49:18] <wolverinewaswrong> Damn it I just bought a gaming PC and I can't see the difference
[0:49:19] <+OneGorillionDollars> paiges special eyes cant see more than 30 fps
[0:49:19] <%shadowace2400> what?
[0:49:19] <%BogBodyPositive> I also can't tell from my screen
[0:49:20] <+Deekman> Im watching this on a 480p stream
[0:49:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I'm not 100.... like..... it looked choppier I think
[0:49:21] <SaltyFront> Is it just me, or does Varl look like Donald Glover?
[0:49:26] <%BigCoffee> PAT WAT WAS IT
[0:49:27] <majindusto> I can't see it too
[0:49:29] <Samuel412> I see it, but can't say I'd have noticed it without Pat pointing it out
[0:49:31] <DusK_The_Stray> Can't see more than 30 frames
[0:49:31] <hereiam407> Paige can't see past 30fps
[0:49:31] <@QueequegTheater> Paige has evolved beyond the need for eyes
[0:49:32] <xinexes> is pat ok?
[0:49:36] <Gloppie> It turns into an actual slideshow
[0:49:39] <%MelBrooksKA> I was in 480p so I couldn't see it
[0:49:40] <xbb1024> that's a way to break your neck
[0:49:43] <cpt_langosta> which tomb raider one?
[0:49:44] <blackbeaking> I'm with paige I also can't see it... guess I'm blind too
[0:49:45] <+pugszerosugar> Paige remains in 30 fps as fief is 60.
[0:49:45] <%PatNTheHat> Which Tomb Raider 1?
[0:49:46] <SaltyFront> Gatdam, the water looks great
[0:49:47] <hereiam407> It got much smoother on favor performance
[0:49:48] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Because she can see things
[0:49:48] <ttc_lover> Can you show resolution mode while running around a little?
[0:49:49] <%blastyoboots> It was less than halved frame rate
[0:49:51] <+poordoughboy> im gonna be honest i was not paying attention because i was shitposting
[0:49:54] <%TerpanderLux> no
[0:49:57] <HeroToxiko> Im accidentally on 1080 60, it felt bad
[0:50:06] <Ravioli_Ronin> That water def wasn’t deep enough for a dive that high
[0:50:14] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Paige if the water wasn't deep she wouldn't be allowed to dive, duh
[0:50:19] <+OneGorillionDollars> Paige's sees real life at 30 fps too
[0:50:26] <disflipmat> We'd better OPEN the CRAFT MENU
[0:50:28] <r0termond> why even is there a resolution mode, like who would choose that
[0:50:29] <cpt_langosta> wood: ridged for her pleasure
[0:50:29] <+Deekman> That’s a sick idea for the hud
[0:50:32] <%Bloomingzonda> @Ravioli_Ronin its thick alien water
[0:50:33] <Saltmeisterr> damn
[0:50:35] <hereiam407> Big Ridged Wood
[0:50:36] <%PatNTheHat> Bitch picked up a WHOLE TREE
[0:50:38] <Saltmeisterr> that pretty woter
[0:50:40] <$Gehtingsberg> poof
[0:50:43] <disflipmat> No goblin children
[0:50:44] <%TerpanderLux> that tutorial made me stop playing the game
[0:50:49] <%luftraumm1> man the character you play teaching a second character is such a better tutorial
[0:50:51] <Jontman42> that wasn't sarcasm
[0:51:06] <churropoppa> Kappa
[0:51:14] <hereiam407> Eghhh
[0:51:14] <%Pookiedaexzile> Why No Gun
[0:51:15] <@QueequegTheater> Fun fact, we can only really visually distinguish up to around 80ish fps.  Higher than that DOES feel better but it's virtually impossible to tell just by looking at it
[0:51:15] <%PatNTheHat> Pat  you're literally 6 inches tall
[0:51:16] <arcadianskypirate> uh huh
[0:51:18] <+HitmanBillson> pat has a 5 foot vertical leap. Heard it here folks
[0:51:19] <thehullowed> !uptime
[0:51:19] <Tunamanguy> who left the toilet seat in the ladder?
[0:51:19] <@Moobot> @thehullowed I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 51m 28s.
[0:51:19] <$SGrim> If someone threw you?
[0:51:20] <$Gehtingsberg> YOU could?
[0:51:21] <+Deekman> Is this still built on the same engine as death stranding?
[0:51:22] <Samuel412> That lock was on there for a THOUSAND years
[0:51:22] <%RayReborne> yup
[0:51:24] <%TerpanderLux> ewwww
[0:51:24] <cpt_langosta> only if paige bounced you first like a ball
[0:51:25] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Pat  could do it 9 times
[0:51:27] <thunderborn32> i dont think i used base arrows beyond the tutorial a single time
[0:51:27] <AtisutoCurry> copium strong
[0:51:28] <disflipmat> oooh that melee animation
[0:51:31] <%RayReborne> first game had square to crouch too
[0:51:31] <%chiazam> No you could not Pat
[0:51:32] <+RedMaskBandit> no you couldnt
[0:51:35] <Midnight188> teabag the earth, show it you dont respect it
[0:51:36] <%strakillias> That moss looks nice
[0:51:37] <arkv01> pat is basically ant man and can jump like 10x his height
[0:51:37] <outsidedoubtside> I played this for a bit when the complete edition came out, but the movement was just too slow for me, even on robotback
[0:51:41] <%DianaTheAscian> I remember just mashing the shoot button was the best dps I found in he last game
[0:51:41] <valhallandoates> that fuzzy grass is amazin
[0:51:47] <PlumpPotatoRump> Square is t-bag?
[0:51:49] <@QueequegTheater> I like that she fights with a spear

[0:53:31] <+black_pariah> i assume this is demeter at work
[0:54:00] <disflipmat> Might be a rogue copy of demeter or something
[0:55:07] <FullMetalEmblem> did he start the game?

[0:55:09] <@Ranryu692> wow, SH Figuarts made figures of the twins from Trigger's Star Wars short
[0:55:16] <+polothegreatest> So, hzd is tapping greek mythology? plagueWut
[0:55:20] <Samuel412> Demeter is the animal making one? so like a rogue demeter trying to create a bunch of invasive species to compete with the new biosphere?
[0:55:33] <PizzicatoFive5> did the stream end already?
[0:55:41] <+black_pariah> demeter was the plant ai
[0:55:47] <disflipmat> Demeter made plants, Hephaestus made robot designs
[0:55:53] <%Cozy90> @PizzicatoFive5 paige had to poo
[0:55:54] <+black_pariah> Artemis did the animals
[0:55:58] <%VentWilsn> @PizzicatoFive5 pat's taking gief out
[0:56:00] <disflipmat> and uh...I forgot which one made animal
[0:56:04] <disflipmat> artemis, yeah
[0:56:17] <%moondog_> @black_pariah nah he had to carry Paige upstair to shit
[0:56:18] <disflipmat> Poseidon does sea life and water purifications
[0:56:20] <@QueequegTheater> I hope a Hades clone is about to kill us then a frost axe kills it from offscreen and then flies back out of frame and then Aloy looks at the camera and says "We really were the Final Fantasy: Stranger of Paradise all along."
[0:56:27] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What was the AI from the DLC? Just some random hydro-plant system right?
[0:56:46] <disflipmat> Cyan, yeah. It was just a monitoring AI for Yellowstone
[0:56:49] <SaltyFront> CYAN was taking care of the Yellowstone volcano
[0:56:56] <+black_pariah> Cyan was keeping the yellowstone caldrea under control
[0:56:59] <%TerpanderLux> hey
[0:56:59] <Samuel412> Cause like, one thing I like about the plot is that the AIs don't go "rogue" per se. Hades was literally trying to do its designed job and it's only a problem that it was activated
[0:57:03] <+black_pariah> *caldera
[0:57:09] <+polothegreatest> yep, greek, now i get it
[0:57:10] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I want to see more of Cyan, they were great
[0:57:19] <disflipmat> real talk I kinda loved the hell out of the world building in HZD
[0:57:27] <%D00msDayDan> otter
[0:57:29] <disflipmat> oooh, upgrades
[0:57:29] <cpt_langosta> ferretbot
[0:57:31] <SaltyFront> I want more Concrete Beach Party
[0:57:34] <+ghostfaceninja_> weasel
[0:57:37] <+PrincessLuna85> otter or ferret maybe
[0:57:38] <+CookieCutter007> looks like a ferret
[0:57:39] <+UltraViolet371> it's so cuuuute wf
[0:57:39] <plaest2k> weaselbot
[0:57:39] <Samuel412> So they need to justify why the AI is doing this other than just "rogue evil copy"
[0:57:40] <@QueequegTheater> It looks like a good boy
[0:57:48] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Blow ups its fany pack, then go for it's eye
[0:57:49] <deviljhojho_> nice way to do a tutorial
[0:57:55] <disflipmat> fucking lol "okay, glowing weak spots, got it"
[0:57:55] <SaltyFront> I M WEASEL!
[0:57:57] <@QueequegTheater> @Samuel412 Hades wasn't just a rogue evil copy
[0:57:58] <+polothegreatest> so whens kratos gonna show up? roofleMay
[0:58:00] <cpt_langosta> mustelids are known for their weak asses
[0:58:04] <xbb1024> I can't controller aim for shit
[0:58:09] <majindusto> BLOW UP IT'S  ASS
[0:58:09] <@QueequegTheater> @Samuel412 It was an AI with no offswitch
[0:58:15] <hereiam407> Cool music
[0:58:17] <tanarath> This is a great way to do tutorials.
[0:58:20] <SaltyFront> GO FOR THE EYE'S, BOO!
[0:58:23] <%BogBodyPositive> aww him just a baby
[0:58:24] <@QueequegTheater> D:
[0:58:26] <arcadianskypirate> Man, this game makes me realize how far video games have come in such a short amount of time.
[0:58:37] <%TerpanderLux> im not mad :)
[0:58:38] <Samuel412> @QueequegTheater as I said. Hades actions make perfect sense
[0:58:40] <dero45> worms
[0:58:41] <%luftraumm1> oooooo model viewer
[0:58:42] <+ElRoyjo> Think the premise of the second game is them getting to the off switch.
[0:58:46] <Jontman42> same
[0:58:48] <disflipmat> Eyes are weak points for pretty much everything
[0:58:49] <%RayReborne> this is a SEXY u. i ngl
[0:58:49] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Underground? I hate them already
[0:58:51] <majindusto> But yeah, That's  a Ferret/Otter robot
[0:58:55] <plaest2k> i also hate getting shot in my compressed airsac
[0:58:56] <cpt_langosta> my compressed air sac is also my weak point
[0:58:57] <%MrBorisMakarov> compressed air sac aka the cussy
[0:59:01] <@QueequegTheater> I hate when bitches shoot my air sac
[0:59:09] <%PrimalDweeb> Those ones you should be able to hit with your stick
[0:59:10] <@QueequegTheater> comprussy
[0:59:13] <hereiam407> My compressed air sac is full
[0:59:25] <Samuel412> This tutorial is almost beat-for-beat the tutorial from the first game with Aloy taking position as teacher
[0:59:27] <%maskofmichael> @QueequegTheater LUL LUL LUL
[0:59:28] <%MrBorisMakarov> @queequegtheater I like that better atpRtsd
[0:59:29] <SaltyFront> lol, it's now totally witcher sense

[1:00:47] <hereiam407> Big box of tech magic

[1:02:40] <%PrimalDweeb> The Zuck, has assumed his true form in this game. It's about time honestly.
[1:02:43] <Samuel412> Project Zero Dawn was literal apocalypse proofing, to be fair
[1:02:48] <disflipmat> Pat how's the Dualsense feel?
[1:02:56] <Zappaslave> Gotta see an ad before I can watch the same game being streamed

[1:03:56] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> sucks to suck I guess
[1:03:59] <dero45> poop
[1:04:01] <Zappaslave> green fire = acid
[1:04:02] <disflipmat> Everything else looks immaculate and then just green bubbles = acid
[1:04:09] <cpt_langosta> bucket knight...?
[1:04:12] <%luftraumm1> snek
[1:04:25] <Ravioli_Ronin> The hyper realism + video game effects kinda throws me off

[1:05:15] <+polothegreatest> Batman grappler gun LUL
[1:05:16] <xxshadowxx416> no spider man
[1:05:24] <dero45> becoming batwoman
[1:05:26] <%blastyoboots> Gib hook
[1:05:28] <disflipmat> right through his armor; icky pooey
[1:05:32] <%PrimalDweeb> Yeah, that hair is having a hard time.
[1:05:33] <Zappaslave> c'mon big rope
[1:05:37] <+UltraViolet371> having clueless guy along is a perfect way to tutorialize without making Aloy look stupid
[1:05:38] <EynoStiles> It reminds me of batman, when she use the focus
[1:05:50] <mattdaddyd365> grapple the your mom
[1:06:00] <disflipmat> WORKBENCH YEAH
[1:06:05] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I wonder if I'm going to have to make an armor set that is acid resistant?
[1:06:09] <%luftraumm1> yooooo
[1:06:09] <%chiazam> Yeaaaaa
[1:06:10] <dero45> thats just a table
[1:06:13] <tanarath> PULLCASTER
[1:06:15] <hereiam407> What if robot spiders made robot webs
[1:06:20] <%chiazam> SHE JUST MADE IT UP
[1:06:21] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> Good 'ol workbenck
[1:06:22] <thunderborn32> what? she never needed a bench before
[1:06:29] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I like that she is bad at names
[1:06:29] <$Gehtingsberg> landmaster!
[1:06:30] <%Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt hows the game feel so far
[1:06:32] <disflipmat> Yeah, cause other weapons are stuff like Ropecaster and Tripcaster
[1:06:34] <cpt_langosta> you can pull my caster anytime, babe
[1:06:38] <tanarath> And she's TERRIBLE at it
[1:06:38] <hereiam407> Does it cast poles?
[1:06:40] <%AncelDeLambert> the real question is whether this game has an upgrade to the tether gun that makes it pull a hawk down WITH LESS THAN TWO SHOTS DAMMIT!
[1:06:43] <dero45> pull faster would have been better
[1:06:50] <Samuel412> @hereiam407 I could see like, an industrial cable web
[1:07:02] <%TerpanderLux> she strong as hell
[1:07:04] <hereiam407> @Samuel412 The strongest ever
[1:07:08] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> Get over here!
[1:07:11] <%PrimalDweeb> Holy rusted metal Batman! You did it!

[1:07:14] <hereiam407> Superhero strength
[1:07:23] <%AncelDeLambert> oh dear, we're still not free of the useless interact button features. Just pull the damn wall down, lady, don't make me mash or hold anything
[1:07:30] <xbb1024> yeah, there was no pulley or leverage, she just pulled it straight
[1:07:32] <$SGrim> Those are chunks of I-Beams. How the fuck can she leverage against nearly half-a-ton on flat ground? HOW HEAVY IS SHE!?
[1:07:45] <ScreamLord> I bet he's a prick too
[1:07:47] <wolverinewaswrong> Bad guy voice
[1:07:48] <azure_dunes> this guy seems like a shitbag
[1:07:49] <%AncelDeLambert> whatever this is, it's probably stupid
[1:07:49] <%VentWilsn> omg Zuck is introducing us to Meta again
[1:07:52] <@QueequegTheater> I already hate him
[1:07:54] <disflipmat> You know, unlike Nier it's crazy how language didn't change at all

[1:11:39] <mattdaddyd365> ye
[1:11:43] <+RushUnplugged> yeah they tried an ark ship and it didn't work
[1:11:46] <%shootbang_exe> this dude is either jeff bezos or elon musk lmao
[1:11:50] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater You're not tall enough to be the MC
[1:11:51] <disflipmat> You learn that Far Zenith was a parallel plan to Zero Dawn but it blew up on the way out of the solar system
[1:11:52] <$SGrim> @black_pariah To show "dogged" determination.
[1:11:52] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt this was plan A. Zero Dawn was plan B
[1:11:54] <+RedMaskBandit> yup
[1:11:55] <%strakillias> They just introduced and said fuck space within 5 minutes

[1:12:38] <%blastyoboots> ELIET
[1:12:41] <hereiam407> Classy
[1:12:41] <%TerpanderLux> NOOOOOO
[1:12:43] <ErikFeral> "another catastrophe brings risk to the World...'s Elite!"
[1:12:48] <@DakotaMacDoodle> oh no it Jeff Musk

[1:12:49] <@PrefectusCorgi> LUL
[1:12:49] <$SGrim> Cool.
[1:12:49] <%marvel877> Oh, so just save the rich people, huh?
[1:12:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> WHAT IS HE DOINT???
[1:12:51] <Samuel412> @ScreamLord There are plot reasons they actually would
[1:12:55] <mattdaddyd365> buy are NFT
[1:12:59] <tigerfang86> Eat the rich
[1:12:59] <%barrakuta371> too many problems, time to leave Earth. sucks for anyone left behind
[1:13:00] <%derpmandwn999> OH NO, SPACE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED BY CAPITALISM
[1:13:00] <EynoStiles> Lets escape a shitty world to make an another world thats shit
[1:13:01] <%CourageTheCat> Belon Shusk
[1:13:02] <%chiazam> @AncelDeLambert Naw none of the scientists thought it would work, especially Elisabet
[1:13:05] <%blastyoboots> it is.
[1:13:06] <%AncelDeLambert> the people on this project think "sublety" is only found in a 3 star restaurant
[1:13:06] <tanarath> Horizon is what happens when rich people terraform earth
[1:13:09] <dero45> no ?s asked
[1:13:11] <hereiam407> Space Dawn
[1:13:12] <tigerfang86> Y e a h
[1:13:15] <tigerfang86> Y E A H
[1:13:16] <%marvel877> Either that or if Elon gets to build more rockets out in Texas.
[1:13:16] <%CourageTheCat> yep
[1:13:17] <%YakumoYomi> Wasn't that also the case with Xenoblade X?
[1:13:17] <ErikFeral> this mofo gotta fade and tshirt/jeans during A PRESENTATION ON ROCKETING OFF EARTH WITH THE BILLOINARES
[1:13:18] <Ravioli_Ronin> Investor class fucking sucks
[1:13:19] <%Broand> I dunno what that means and I'm not gonna ask
[1:13:23] <IntrepidEye> ye
[1:13:27] <hereiam407> As they do
[1:13:32] <%Tarage> Big ded
[1:13:32] <%DianaTheAscian> or they did make it to space
[1:13:38] <+RedMaskBandit> did pat not play the 1st one?
[1:13:39] <%notsoy> ded
[1:13:39] <arkv01> haha dumb elite deados
[1:13:41] <James_Quivers> I'm predicting a plot twist where they totally aren't dead
[1:13:41] <%AncelDeLambert> "only care about their own skin" THERE'S A NATION RIGHT BY YOUR HOME THAT HAS SLAVES!
[1:13:44] <disflipmat> I swear Aloy acts like an isekai protag now
[1:13:46] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt I see this game believes subtly is for cowards
[1:13:47] <Zappaslave> But how does she KNOW
[1:13:48] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> wouldn't a planet with nothing but elite tear each other to shreds with no plebs to fuck with?
[1:13:48] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This is also a plot point in Fallout. The Enclave wants to build a spaceship to peace out
[1:13:51] <%Tarage> Pat did NOT play the first one.
[1:13:58] <%CourageTheCat> honestly all of the world's 1% sploding in a spaceship is probably the most silver lining one could possibly glean from this
[1:13:58] <cpt_langosta> a platypus with a MASSIVE erection
[1:14:00] <%D00msDayDan> @RedMaskBandit he got to the desert and stopped both times he tried to get into it
[1:14:00] <%chiazam> @chiazam More like Project please sacrifice your lives fighting robots for a false hope that you can save your loved ones
[1:14:05] <hereiam407> Space Robot Dinos I hope
[1:14:06] <%CourageTheCat> platinum line
[1:14:07] <%DianaTheAscian> Lavos
[1:14:07] <jtsoppy137> a big one
[1:14:07] <$Emperor_Machinus> forbidden US
[1:14:10] <luciluxlu0> mid life crisis
[1:14:11] <ErikFeral> Something Forbidden that sends up Westward.
[1:14:11] <%blastyoboots> You mean how many?
[1:14:13] <@goose_attack_almanac> could be detroit
[1:14:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @WackyGear I met a subtlety once, it killed my dog
[1:14:14] <%Tarage> That doesn't count.
[1:14:15] <dero45> same lol
[1:14:15] <stantheman_97> NO NOT SAN FRANCISCO
[1:14:16] <@QueequegTheater> Jenova
[1:14:16] <EynoStiles> Someone reactivated the killer A.I for knowledge.
[1:14:19] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Like a third
[1:14:22] <James_Quivers> AMONG
[1:14:25] <auraoftheearth009> the origin of the signal or following what's his face
[1:14:26] <%luftraumm1> played before the big plot points come up
[1:14:28] <Psyramics> no, you played like 20%
[1:14:29] <hakumaribo> WAIT
[1:14:30] <Ravioli_Ronin> Forbidden weast
[1:14:30] <xbb1024> oh, then you don't know the story
[1:14:31] <%chiazam> I wouldn't say that's half yeah
[1:14:31] <%RayReborne> second chest
[1:14:32] <hakumaribo> theres another chest
[1:14:33] <%VentWilsn> @chiazam OH......
[1:14:33] <hakumaribo> i think
[1:14:35] <%ForlornCarton> Another chest up there
[1:14:36] <yficaptions> is this uncharted
[1:14:37] <koffeemancer> there was another chest
[1:14:38] <%strakillias> thebdesrt is at like the 1/3 mark unless you did the snow dlc area
[1:14:38] <mattdaddyd365> horizon half Dawn
[1:14:40] <@PrefectusCorgi> There was another Box Upper
[1:14:43] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt it's a tad shame, the only time I enjoyed the first game was the last two robot types, because it became Monster Hunter
[1:14:46] <$Gehtingsberg> "san Francisco is gone now!"
[1:14:46] <%Tarage> "I played a third of Endwalker and... uh... we killed god I guess?"
[1:14:51] <hereiam407> Focus your Pole caster
[1:14:57] <+gallanthartzhartz> I feel like climate stories have stopped being subtle because they've realized it doesn't work lol
[1:14:59] <+RedMaskBandit> yikes pat Ted Faro gets worse at the later half
[1:14:59] <disflipmat> Man traversal looks real good
[1:14:59] <%PrimalDweeb> I hope the dialog options are a little more in depth this time around, and less Fallout 4 like.
[1:15:03] <%Tarage> Nah it's cool.
[1:15:03] <kinkade_77> she strong
[1:15:04] <%AncelDeLambert> naaaaaaaah

[1:15:12] <%AncelDeLambert> fek the first one
[1:15:12] <xxshadowxx416> @Tarage yeah
[1:15:14] <hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt nah the recap was good enough
[1:15:14] <hereiam407> Clap

[1:15:17] <%ClericOfSparda> I'm fine
[1:15:19] <+the_glizzy_wizzy> Fuck Ted Fero
[1:15:20] <%Tarage> I was answering someone's question if you had played it or not.
[1:15:23] <%AncelDeLambert> he's unhumanely stupid
[1:15:23] <%octotasty> there's no need to play horizon
[1:15:24] <+UltraViolet371> Just play both before elden ring :)
[1:15:30] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I'm good with the current events
[1:15:33] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Watch a youtube video and youll be caught up.
[1:15:34] <penitentpendant> TBF, that's appropriate concerning Ted Faro
[1:15:36] <%CourageTheCat> funny dogy
[1:15:38] <%Tarage> ROBOT FERETS
[1:15:40] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> RE snake
[1:15:44] <dero45> im still gonna play dont spoil
[1:15:45] <+polothegreatest> Already spoiled at the begining here LUL
[1:15:46] <@QueequegTheater> I can't believe Ted Faro was the culprit all along
[1:15:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> Its Pat's Fault the chat spoils
[1:15:49] <%CourageTheCat> god they're so cute
[1:15:50] <%AncelDeLambert> the backstory plot of Horizon 1 is so cynical it makes me want to punch the writers
[1:15:51] <%PrimalDweeb> Beat them with your stick!
[1:15:51] <%marvel877> this is good enough. besides, this intro feels like a sufficient enough info dump of the first game.
[1:15:52] <%Tarage> Her hair is freaking the fuck out.
[1:15:53] <%CourageTheCat> I want to pet htem
[1:15:53] <yficaptions> tumblr girl face
[1:15:56] <ErikFeral> her hair is phasing through her shoulders
[1:15:58] <Zappaslave> I believe in you Pat. You CAN do this
[1:15:58] <+RedMaskBandit> SAME it was you who told me he was bad
[1:16:03] <%aWanderingKaivo> stab it in the tubes
[1:16:04] <hereiam407> I dont know how to take care of them
[1:16:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @QueequegTheater HE WAS THO!
[1:16:06] <Paperware> Why are the robots all furries?
[1:16:08] <%CourageTheCat> I would like to Pet It
[1:16:08] <+DragonArt07> robo weasels!
[1:16:10] <%chiazam> Elisabet convinces the military to lie to the public that Zero Dawn will save them when actually it was so humanity would be born again after they all inevitably die
[1:16:11] <+Deekman> @patstaresat check out that 1 hour horizon 1 recap I linked you on Twitter. It’s a great wrap up
[1:16:12] <%TerpanderLux> kill
[1:16:17] <dero45> slap that botty
[1:16:17] <disflipmat> @dero45 for real if you still want to play the first game I'd dip out, cause even the intro spoiled everything about the first game
[1:16:20] <Parapattern> That's a fucking Zoid
[1:16:21] <Samuel412> They're like, thematically retreading Varl's whole arc from the first game
[1:16:37] <GrandmasterBFunk> whenever i hear Ted Faro i get them confused with Ted Lasso and all i can think of is "Damn what happens in season 2 that made people sour on him?"

[1:16:38] <cpt_langosta> mustelidiot
[1:16:38] <dero45> @Parapattern not yet lol
[1:16:43] <Ghufufin> right in the robussy
[1:16:45] <%VentWilsn> @chiazam .....wtf
[1:16:47] <EynoStiles> @anceldelambert You right. its not like we have the rich elite try to destroy the world right now. i mean who would believe that
[1:16:56] <dero45> @disflipmat i prob will just checking it out
[1:16:57] <%BigCoffee> yo those robots are strangely fragile
[1:17:01] <%chiazam> @chiazam Oh its so fucked
[1:17:16] <%Pookiedaexzile> That's called Sativa Pat
[1:17:17] <intestinal_bleeding> the stealth grass
[1:17:17] <auraoftheearth009> there's stealth grass and death grass
[1:17:17] <cpt_langosta> DON'T SMOKE THE RED GRASS
[1:17:20] <Zappaslave> Isn't Varl the name of the horned men in Banner Saga?
[1:17:25] <%CourageTheCat> I mean when all weapons you're using are made outta the same stuff as the robots it should probably be fine
[1:17:33] <xxshadowxx416> run
[1:17:37] <disflipmat> Right in the friggin' eye
[1:17:38] <fistynopunches> its so dumb there have to be huge patches of red foliage just for Aloy's hair
[1:17:39] <dero45> i like the raptors better tbh
[1:17:43] <%chance_h> The red symbolizes your hair because it’s red
[1:17:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> Just Stand  thru the metal its cool
[1:17:53] <%PrimalDweeb> GG
[1:17:56] <%luftraumm1> I love stealth grass
[1:17:58] <%CourageTheCat> @PatStaresAt so did you lose your takeover ability from the first game?
[1:18:03] <%BigCoffee> why do robots die from 1 hit of a stick
[1:18:04] <%AncelDeLambert> @EynoStiles don't be obtuse. Faro singularly destroys the world and then humanity's ability to learn from their mistakes. ONE person glasses the planet
[1:18:04] <dero45> can u just roll none stop like before
[1:18:05] <%Fooguwu> you really fucked their merekussies
[1:18:07] <%BigCoffee> wtf is this
[1:18:14] <ammobasket> red hair = better hiding in red grass
[1:18:17] <+UltraViolet371> so many jagras
[1:18:17] <Zappaslave> I wonder if Stealth Grass feels as fluffy as it looks
[1:18:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Zappaslave I think you're right yeah
[1:18:20] <mattdaddyd365> lucky your hair the same color so they well never know.
[1:18:23] <%CourageTheCat> @BigCoffee the stick is made of the robots
[1:18:26] <%chance_h> Horizon Zero Dawn 2

[1:18:39] <%BigCoffee> @BigCoffee its still a stick
[1:18:40] <dero45> i hate the red grass but it is what it is
[1:18:47] <%chiazam> Project Zero Dawn kidnaps numerous scientists and experts and gives them three choices, 1. work on the project, 2. Become a prisoner forbidden from working on the project, or 3. Medical euthanasia
[1:18:56] <$Falilth> was the flowers/  grass in MGS3 the best ps2 grass?

[1:19:08] <%chance_h> Lol
[1:19:12] <disflipmat> You know, Jin wouldn't have let those foxes die
[1:19:12] <%octotasty> they only have one dead fox model
[1:19:18] <fistynopunches> is the entire game blighttown?
[1:19:19] <arcadianskypirate> That's almost as crazy as getting concerned about a girl's peach fuzz
[1:19:22] <%CourageTheCat> Ancient Hobo Barrel
[1:19:27] <%blastyoboots> Why is it always fox
[1:19:27] <+Deekman> Wtf how late into the game was that line added?!
[1:19:27] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> eh, foxes reek
[1:19:30] <SaltyFront> Lol, beards remind her too much of Rost i guess
[1:19:31] <cpt_langosta> beard-on-beard hatred is getting worse smh
[1:19:31] <%VentWilsn> the blight also kicked the fox while it was tangled
[1:19:32] <%chiazam> Of course no one was euthanized against there will but they were kidnapped against their will
[1:19:35] <dero45> they learned fire
[1:19:40] <%sighphers> thought that was a bbq
[1:19:45] <+Deekman> “Sorry my whiskers offend you” seems pointed
[1:19:46] <%blastyoboots> Is this a furry war against foxes
[1:19:50] <hakumaribo> Well if Jojo has taught us anything, you can gauge how evil something is on how willing it is to kill a cute defenseless animal.
[1:19:55] <Manwad> a fuckin' health pot
[1:19:59] <mattdaddyd365> yeah Alloy you got a beard to

[1:20:29] <+Deekman> @queequegtheater right?!
[1:20:30] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt That seems really useful on harder difficulties. The first enemy chunked me for ~75% of my health
[1:20:38] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[1:20:47] <%chiazam> I'm so happy the inventory is ficed in this game
[1:21:03] <@QueequegTheater> @Deekman I'm not being incredulous.  It's literally not possible that it's a response, game dev doesn't work like that
[1:21:14] <%Quigsies> Hey Pat, how Forbidden is the West so far?
[1:21:23] <@QueequegTheater> You need 3 more Jagras scales

[1:26:34] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pat emd the stream the moment I arrive. Say you already streamed enough for today
[1:26:38] <cpt_langosta> do not anger the Chozo Ghosts until you have the X-ray Visor
[1:26:38] <Kain5707> ghosts of dead robots
[1:26:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> in the machine, one might say
[1:26:38] <%sighphers> can varl not read?
[1:26:41] <$Falilth> ectogenesis would be soul creation
[1:26:41] <%CourageTheCat> some kind of ghost
[1:26:43] <%CourageTheCat> in  the shell...
[1:26:52] <%Tarage> No steppy for you
[1:26:55] <%CourageTheCat> @sighphers why would any of them be able to read
[1:26:58] <%CourageTheCat> cavemen
[1:27:08] <+RushUnplugged> Ectogenesis means using an artificial uterus
[1:27:09] <%PrimalDweeb> The yellow will guide thee
[1:27:11] <+total_overkill> @sighphers nanites, son
[1:27:20] <%CourageTheCat> @RushUnplugged ghost uterus
[1:27:24] <+black_pariah> what are the odds they restore apollo before games end
[1:27:25] <%D00msDayDan> @CourageTheCat only the nora were cavemen, the carja got pretty civilized
[1:27:37] <$Falilth> what does a mount in wow have to do with this
[1:27:38] <hereiam407> worlds a fuck
[1:27:39] <%D00msDayDan> wow is that the female krogan from ME3?
[1:27:58] <@QueequegTheater> I hate that they go out of their way to overpronounce the T in Elizabet
[1:27:58] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> They just stole it
[1:28:02] <James_Quivers> This plot is just Promare TBH
[1:28:04] <+RushUnplugged> guys they can read, the first clones were thought english and basic stuff to at least pre-school levels. They just lost actual knowledge
[1:28:06] <+black_pariah> aw shit
[1:28:08] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah the carja had their own written religion
[1:28:10] <hereiam407> The place robot can't touch me
[1:28:14] <%Soliloquy123> Sci-fi settings just love Greek myth for names, huh
[1:28:16] <Samuel412> It's not clear if the facilities taught the new humans to read, or if the Nora retained that knowledge. The Carja can read and write, though
[1:28:16] <thunderborn32> OH NO
[1:28:18] <@QueequegTheater> JUST FUCKEN YOINKED IT
[1:28:23] <disflipmat> Oh shit, they might still have Apollo
[1:28:23] <Kain5707> Emet Pog
[1:28:26] <churropoppa> @D00msDayDan I was thinking that lol. And bloodhound from Apex
[1:28:28] <fistynopunches> that haicut
[1:28:29] <thunderborn32> it copied the bad parts too!
[1:28:34] <%chiazam> They were supposed to only get Apollo
[1:28:35] <%chance_h> Borrowed
[1:28:44] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Big traps
[1:28:44] <SaltyFront> ahahah the double take
[1:28:52] <auraoftheearth009> So them hacking it activated Hades
[1:28:57] <Paperware> What exactly even IS a technologist?
[1:29:00] <SaltyFront> Troy figuring it out
[1:29:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Because me clone

[1:29:20] <dero45> i dont get it
[1:29:23] <%D00msDayDan> finding this out in the first game was really cool though
[1:29:24] <ohno58> ehhh....
[1:29:24] <mr_saturday93> If they stole it then they might still have it
[1:29:27] <HeroToxiko> Everyone is a clone
[1:29:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Me cave men me no underrstand gene?
[1:29:32] <%CourageTheCat> THE GHOST KIND
[1:29:35] <disflipmat> Yeah, they're pretty much explaining all of the twists from the first game in the first hour here
[1:29:35] <fistynopunches> a realy good 3d printer
[1:29:36] <%Tarage> Bunga
[1:29:42] <%cvp5127> just like paige

[1:29:48] <+ghostfaceninja_> wait like test tube baby or actually an android proper
[1:29:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Use cavemen terms Qlloy
[1:29:54] <@QueequegTheater> God, her hair is gorgeous
[1:29:57] <cpt_langosta> Objective: Explain genetics to this caveman
[1:30:00] <James_Quivers> Varl's entire fucking world view is being shaken up and he's taking it pretty damn well TBH
[1:30:04] <xbb1024> he will figure it out
[1:30:07] <disflipmat> test tube baby, she's a clone of Elizabet
[1:30:07] <hereiam407> I'm Jesus
[1:30:08] <auraoftheearth009> He is one of her only friends
[1:30:10] <arkv01> wait so is there gonna be some soul transfer happening?
[1:30:11] <+OneGorillionDollars> this man is just like "what in the fuck"
[1:30:11] <+RedMaskBandit> a mecha uterus
[1:30:14] <tigerfang86> bro you cant just tell a guy that
[1:30:14] <%Broand> tips fedora
[1:30:14] <%luftraumm1> varl simple man
[1:30:14] <%Tarage> "GOD IS DEAD"
[1:30:14] <%DianaTheAscian> this dude should be having a mental break down rn
[1:30:15] <%maskofmichael> he should of been in the first game then
[1:30:15] <@QueequegTheater> This dude can't even read
[1:30:15] <malcobraaklynny> les enfants terrible
[1:30:18] <SaltyFront> lol, every neuron in varl's brain is on fire
[1:30:19] <+Saggitori> THERE IS NO GOD
[1:30:21] <%CourageTheCat> yeah he is taking this incredibly well
[1:30:22] <$SGrim> Technology has become the divine
[1:30:23] <fistynopunches> @ghostfaceninja_ more test tube, shes organic
[1:30:23] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> She did take care of the planet
[1:30:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> On a practical level the difference isn't worth it right now
[1:30:27] <%chiazam> THERE IS NO GOD
[1:30:27] <Khester824> it's the same
[1:30:28] <$Falilth> sufficently advanced tech is just magic / gods
[1:30:30] <Samuel412> The distinction would be irrelevant to this dude
[1:30:30] <Kain5707> so shes Ryne and shes trying to save her girlfriend?
[1:30:31] <disflipmat> UNGA BUNGA BUT GOD
[1:30:32] <%Tarage> "ATTACK AND DETHRONE GOD"
[1:30:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Sounds like God Alloy

[1:30:44] <%VentWilsn> ITS LIKE GOD, BUT U PLUG IT IN
[1:30:47] <koffeemancer> i mean, by this point science is magic stuff
[1:30:49] <$SGrim> ATTACK AND DE-BUG DOG!
[1:30:49] <hakumaribo> man you just destroyed this mans entire world view
[1:30:50] <$Rancaliber_> "GODS ARE DEAD AND WE KILLED THEM"
[1:30:51] <SaltyFront> Collect and Reassemble God
[1:30:52] <$Emperor_Machinus> The artificial mechanical god of old
[1:30:57] <James_Quivers> ALLOY YELL VARL WHY RED MOUNTAIN SPIT FIRE
[1:30:58] <%chiazam> I'VE SEEN YOUR GOD AND SHE'S ASS
[1:30:58] <tigerfang86> Aloy dont try to say gods a computer, we're like barely above hunter-gather right now
[1:30:58] <HeroToxiko> @ghostfaceninja_ the machine was a genetic ark that cloned the remaining human population. the oldest people are just clones the machines birthed
[1:31:00] <TheFlyingChurro> What if God ran on batteries?
[1:31:01] <%blastyoboots> It’s not a god, it’s dog backwards
[1:31:06] <%derpmandwn999> PLUG AND PLAY GOD
[1:31:07] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's also not clear they believe in an afterlife so the distinction is LITERALLY meaningless
[1:31:07] <tanarath> IT'S JUST A BEING WITH SUPER SCIENCE THAT IS BASICALLY OMNIPOTENT
[1:31:07] <Treasure_Vault> Just like that star trek episode about the greek god
[1:31:09] <jabrodey> Well we understood the term "genetically"
[1:31:11] <ammobasket> At least she's not being Anime Vague
[1:31:11] <cpt_langosta> Arthur C. Clarke wasn't fuckin' around when he said that shit.
[1:31:12] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt You also use laser buttons
[1:31:15] <tigerfang86> GUN???
[1:31:15] <%CourageTheCat> it's a slingshot
[1:31:16] <Samuel412> The more you try to explain it, the more you feed into what his conception of a god is
[1:31:17] <%marvel877> He's upset you're showing him the midichlorians.
[1:31:18] <intestinal_bleeding> GUN
[1:31:18] <%RayReborne> Slingshot
[1:31:18] <Seth_Tek> slingshot
[1:31:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gun
[1:31:21] <%PrimalDweeb> Yeah, but bows and arrows are still technology. Just a more primitive form.
[1:31:22] <Zebroneath> slingshot
[1:31:23] <jtsoppy137> GUN
[1:31:23] <Zappaslave> It's a slingshot
[1:31:23] <%VentWilsn> that looks like a slingshot
[1:31:25] <azure_dunes> L1 for weapon wheel
[1:31:26] <+ghostfaceninja_> shoot gun
[1:31:26] <stantheman_97> explain cloning, genetics, and vat growing to someone who is essentially a caveman
[1:31:30] <%maskofmichael> gun time
[1:31:31] <%RayReborne> L1
[1:31:32] <intestinal_bleeding> just wait until we gotta explain NFTs to varl
[1:31:32] <Warbot40> Like...there's no god...but that might as well be one.
[1:31:34] <+RedMaskBandit> yeah the dlc pokes fun at itself because of that same distinction
[1:31:34] <stormhawk9891> SlingGBun
[1:31:35] <%luftraumm1> frost is the best status effect
[1:31:38] <$Falilth> they said here the grenade launcher missed you
[1:31:39] <dero45> new sling shot
[1:31:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GUN for the ps2 and xbox original
[1:31:41] <JowiJoestar> god is dead, we have guns now
[1:31:42] <HeroToxiko> also the same machine causes the apocalypse so it makes sense that they worship it
[1:31:45] <James_Quivers> "Varl, let me tell you about THE PATRIOTS"
[1:31:51] <@QueequegTheater> Oh no
[1:32:02] <%CourageTheCat> la li lu le lo?

[1:32:16] <%aWanderingKaivo> Varl, let me tell you about cryptocurrency

[1:43:40] <%RayReborne> Doom? grapple hook. Batman? grapple hook.
[1:43:43] <%CourageTheCat> I hope you get a hookshot in BOTW2

[1:43:45] <%chiazam> Pat can't see yellow
[1:43:45] <Gloppie> Real physics grappling hooks are the pinnacle of video games
[1:43:46] <+smackbear> paragliders and grapplehooks are dank
[1:43:46] <+max_radical> anyone else entirely enable to play the first game because the camera drifts and sways wherever the fuck it wants?
[1:43:54] <fistynopunches> Magenta doesn't exist because it has no wavelength

[1:45:32] <+theoldone001> I'm surprised you're up so late you Boomer
[1:45:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I like how biomes like this would have another 300 years before the entire structure c9llapses because rust
[1:45:36] <Ravioli_Ronin> “Oh no it’s too cold for the shuttle’s O-rings”
[1:45:36] <Louie_Salmon> I do wish video game women were allowed to not constantly talk about what they plan to do in 5 seconds

[1:46:02] <sriracha_cream> @ShinSanitater Well it makes no sense that she doesnt given that she sleeps alone in slit up robo carcasses every night lol
[1:46:07] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The real Pat was the friends we made along the way
[1:46:09] <cpt_langosta> and then it wasn't fine, the end
[1:46:18] <+Deekman> @patstaresat did they say what city you’re in the ruins of right now?
[1:46:47] <@QueequegTheater> @sriracha_cream Everyone in the Nora smell like shit, they're tribals with no running water
[1:46:51] <@QueequegTheater> *smells
[1:46:57] <disflipmat> @Deekman they didn't say, but he hasn't hit the coast yet so probably utah or nevada
[1:47:04] <MidnightPacif1c> I wonder if flame dot is as broken in this game
[1:47:24] <+black_pariah> i think this is texas, possibly
[1:47:30] <+Deekman> @disflipmat yeah I was wondering if it’s Nevada if that pyramid is the Luxor in Vegas
[1:47:49] <+sonofthedeepsouth> good
[1:47:50] <disflipmat> I didn't even see it, but maybe, yeah
[1:47:51] <%depressed_skeleton> i thought pat was a pro video gamer u_u

[1:50:06] <+max_radical> i cant wait to never hear the words forbidden west again coz theyll be replaced by elden and ring, like zero dawn being replaced by breath and wild
[1:50:13] <disflipmat> Geez Aloy
[1:50:23] <%GuildmasterAhnonay> The first game was really good at having the start point of its climbing sequences be impossible as fuck to find
[1:50:24] <%RayReborne> this music is pretty good
[1:50:38] <%depressed_skeleton> Why not just shoot arrow at cables....
[1:50:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> That Harlem scene LUL
[1:50:42] <%RayReborne> the bass
[1:50:46] <@QueequegTheater> That guy got it rough
[1:50:48] <+YharnamNighthawk> Hey Zeus
[1:50:48] <%marvel877> Or Ghost Ship
[1:50:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I laugh everytime
[1:50:51] <xbb1024> Classic Christmas movies
[1:50:51] <%Cozy90> i thought that was 2?
[1:50:51] <Kain5707> Pat whats your thoughts on P3S :)
[1:50:52] <+RushUnplugged> 1 > 3 > 2
[1:50:55] <usuallysleepy> 3 is better than 2 tbh
[1:50:55] <@PrefectusCorgi> Wasnt that 2
[1:50:55] <%RayReborne> Giant shuttle cables?
[1:50:56] <+theoldone001> Die Hard is actually a Christmas movie, true story btw
[1:50:57] <cpt_langosta> sam jackson is extremely in it
[1:50:58] <Mattais88> Who underartes 3? It's great! It even has dead nazis
[1:51:00] <%MrGuy516> who under rates die hard 3?
[1:51:02] <%PrimalDweeb> Die Hard 4 is a guilty pleasure of mine.
[1:51:04] <The_Legendairy> 1 > 3 > 4 > 2
[1:51:05] <+RushUnplugged> 2 is the plane one that sucks
[1:51:13] <stantheman_97> i only ever heard people talk about 1 so i assumed they weren't worth watching
[1:51:20] <+RushUnplugged> 4 is good for the "I was out of bullets" scene
[1:51:32] <%marvel877> dig up
[1:51:34] <%Dementedpenguin> @stantheman_97 just don't watch the 5th movie
[1:51:46] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I remember a video where a trauma surgeon pointed out that the only one John could have reasonably survived was Die Hard 2 (and that jumping into a pool is actually a really smart thing to do to avoid an explosion)
[1:51:46] <earthboy2k> they highlight the yellow ledge in yellow LUL
[1:51:50] <%Cozy90> man that RLM video about bruce willis was so good. i had no idea how much garbage he makes now
[1:51:54] <+RushUnplugged> I legit forgot the 5th one exists

[1:52:25] <artoflec> i remember liking die hard 2 elaFeels
[1:52:31] <Jaysky> Heh, the horizon
[1:52:32] <%Dementedpenguin> The 5th movie doesn't even feel like a Die Hard movie. ResidentSleeper
[1:52:32] <+FierceDeityGabe> The calamity ganon
[1:52:39] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The Red Evil
[1:52:53] <@QueequegTheater> They designed their evil cloud to be graphically appealing
[1:52:55] <auraoftheearth009> Probably a terraforming ,machine in the sky
[1:52:56] <%blastyoboots> Everyone knows red evil
[1:52:57] <%mostbrokenrobo> Die Hard 2 was just a repeat of 1 but somewhat sillier.  Still alright though
[1:52:57] <ohno58> That's dumb
[1:53:09] <%PrimalDweeb> The 5th doesn't exist
[1:53:11] <%superc37> please tell me theres an option in the game that makes her shut the hell up cuz this constant talking is annoying already. like ffs, just give me a fucking waypoint instead of all this pointless dialogue
[1:53:11] <Jaysky> She thought they through
[1:53:13] <%depressed_skeleton> who could have seen this coming
[1:53:13] <Jaysky> *this
[1:53:14] <%depressed_skeleton> WHO
[1:53:16] <%PrimalDweeb> That's how bad it was
[1:53:17] <+sonofthedeepsouth> One has to be the bossfight
[1:53:18] <%SpontaneousC> I cant believe Pat just destroyed Space X
[1:53:18] <Samuel412> I've seen only seen 1 and 3, and have gathered those are the correct ones to have seen
[1:53:19] <knight_verse> Thats the plot storm.
[1:53:21] <ohno58> They sat there while she did all that?
[1:53:22] <fistynopunches> boss fight time?
[1:53:24] <+FierceDeityGabe> Hey do you remember Uncharted
[1:53:24] <jtsoppy137> bad plan
[1:53:27] <SaltyFront> yeah, suck it spacex
[1:53:29] <+RedMaskBandit> these cowards need to give alloy her 8 pack shredded abs already
[1:53:33] <%depressed_skeleton> that landing looked bad
[1:53:40] <Jontman42> almost fucking died
[1:53:45] <xbb1024> in a tomb raider game, you would have had to play that fall
[1:53:45] <azure_dunes> literally a miracle that she lived
[1:53:59] <@QueequegTheater> Why were there so many camera cuts it's fucking CGI
[1:54:03] <+YharnamNighthawk> oh god
[1:54:07] <+YharnamNighthawk> Those drop percentages
[1:54:08] <SaltyFront> OK Pat, RE1 has trained you for this
[1:54:11] <cpt_langosta> Metal... Snake!?
[1:54:11] <%superc37> wait so why do they look like animals again
[1:54:13] <+RedMaskBandit> a miracle that she never got tetanus
[1:54:15] <%greasypete00> why did past humans choose to make ginormous snakes
[1:54:18] <+YharnamNighthawk> Never gonna get a Ruby @PatStaresAt
[1:54:22] <Samuel412> All the debris just kind of Uncharted-ed around her

[1:54:48] <dero45> that just a zoid lol
[1:54:49] <%Cozy90> THATS HOT

[1:56:17] <%PrimalDweeb> There's something really weird about the coloring of this game, it's very... Saturated? Or something?
[1:56:23] <%PrimalDweeb> Maybe it's just because we're watching it on stream?
[1:56:47] <%shry7> it really likes that debris pole
[1:56:53] <disflipmat> Look at this fucking video game boss

[2:00:42] <+RedMaskBandit> PokCharizard
[2:00:44] <tanarath> We've got a sphere grid
[2:00:46] <mattdaddyd365> skill woods
[2:00:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This is not a great skill layout if it takes TIME to go through
[2:00:59] <+iLike_femboys> @PatStaresAt did you saw folding ideas video about NFTs?

[2:02:17] <%RayReborne> YO
[2:02:18] <+YharnamNighthawk> Rain of arrows!
[2:02:19] <tanarath> Capscone skills
[2:02:23] <+black_pariah> so the cinematic panaround from the trailers is actually a game mechanic
[2:02:30] <jtsoppy137> i can see it
[2:02:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> And here is proof
[2:02:34] <SaltyFront> @disflipmat from what i read, it's like a limit break
[2:02:35] <Mattais88> I can see it
[2:02:36] <ScreamLord> You didn't make this tho
[2:02:39] <%Teintstein> "what if monster hunter but robots"
[2:02:40] <%AncelDeLambert> it was a little clear, yeah. And then they fucked up the inventory
[2:02:43] <@QueequegTheater> They literally just stole the Bow moveset
[2:02:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> light bowgun
[2:02:47] <%barrakuta371> yep
[2:02:47] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> This is just single player Monster Hunter, yes
[2:02:48] <Jaysky> It's why I liked Horizon in the first place, the hunting
[2:02:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Where is the Great sword Pat
[2:02:51] <Manwad> so this game is just insect glaive and bow from Monhun
[2:02:55] <cnry_m> Seems legit
[2:02:57] <+FierceDeityGabe> I wish it was more of that and less map icon checklists
[2:02:58] <%PrimalDweeb> Yeah, what is with this sudden emergence of the Sphere Grid in games?
[2:03:05] <+YharnamNighthawk> Bow Gun

[2:06:43] <Vermillion129> I use rope trap so much in the first game
[2:06:51] <+CrimKangaroo> is the stream stuttering for anyone else, or just me?
[2:06:53] <@QueequegTheater> Holy shit the entire first game is completely nullified now

[2:07:49] <GalactikaPhantom> I want aloy to have vergils round trip
[2:07:49] <penitentpendant> TBH, concentration usually helps
[2:07:50] <Kain5707> sneaky archer
[2:07:56] <SaltyFront> Concentration, for part sniping
[2:07:56] <thunderborn32> concentration
[2:07:57] <%RayReborne> @queequegtheater EXACTLY
[2:08:03] <%PrimalDweeb> Good choice
[2:08:09] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm just firm on the fully upgraded version of the tether gun actually saving me ammo by pulling down the hawks faster
[2:08:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Just sneak archer. Like Skyrim taught us
[2:08:24] <fistynopunches> oh boy they brought thunderbirds back didnt they
[2:08:29] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How fast are you going to level up in this game?
[2:08:31] <%AncelDeLambert> man that pissed me off. 3 tethers to 2 tethers to 2 tethers, bite me game
[2:08:31] <thunderborn32> the more time stop pat has the better
[2:08:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Grind it Pat
[2:08:38] <%Captainahab_37> Captainahab_37 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! wow pat you're up late
[2:08:40] <%chiazam> You better be able to
[2:08:45] <+FierceDeityGabe> It might pull some Miles Morales shit
[2:08:45] <%PrimalDweeb> You could in the last game, so why not this one?
[2:08:47] <SaltyFront> based on last game, you can fill it out if you do all side stuff
[2:08:47] <%luftraumm1> loot the snaaaake
[2:08:51] <hakumaribo> can you scavenge the boss?
[2:08:54] <%luftraumm1> carve it
[2:08:56] <+UltraViolet371> You could in the first game, but that's a lot
[2:08:57] <%RayReborne> fucking probably, last games problem was experience becoming useless by the last 4th
[2:09:02] <penitentpendant> If you get skill points from quests, then likely. If you get them only from leveling up. Uh...
[2:09:06] <GalactikaPhantom> The real question if you ll full stream the game
[2:09:06] <%shootbang_exe> snork
[2:09:09] <%Captainahab_37> I never knew Cboyardee made Shut Up and Jam Gaiden
[2:09:11] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt Certain quests will probably just GIVE you a skill point like the last game
[2:09:11] <auraoftheearth009> I imagine there's enough side stuff to unlock them all, otherwise if you do main than probably not w/o ng+
[2:09:12] <%Captainahab_37> or worked on it
[2:09:15] <thunderborn32> can you loot the other 2 snek?
[2:09:16] <Samuel412> Slitherfang? I kind of hate the name
[2:09:22] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, at no point did Pat explain "wow that's a big snake" and then crack a Red Bul
[2:09:23] <%MrGuy516> This looks good enough to play for the next 7 days
[2:09:32] <%Captainahab_37> yo this game's foliage is nuts
[2:09:33] <%AncelDeLambert> and then hear "uh oh, Sphagettios" in his head
[2:09:33] <SaltyFront> lol, watch the snake get demoted to midboss now
[2:09:39] <%PrimalDweeb> If they don't let us get all of them, I'll be very annoyed.
[2:09:41] <%MisterRockett> So what's the reason Alloy doesn't have her giant arsenal in this game? Left them at the party?
[2:09:48] <jtsoppy137> ....
[2:09:50] <%Captainahab_37> is this a different VA or does she just sound different? am i crazy?
[2:09:50] <+AGood_Noodle> An IGN video said the level cap is 50 but you can get more skill points through squests
[2:09:50] <+FierceDeityGabe> You mean Faro
[2:09:50] <Jontman42> excuse me
[2:09:53] <ohno58> Bezussy

[2:15:04] <+UltraViolet371> oope Bungie deleted GAIA
[2:15:04] <@Ranryu692> Destiny 2 isn't real, Pat. You dreamt it
[2:15:09] <%chiazam> Back to Meridian?
[2:15:10] <%AncelDeLambert> and then the Highlander fought the Guardian and it was very blue
[2:15:15] <@QueequegTheater> ALOY, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE STEPPED INTO A WAR WITH THE CABAL ON MARS
[2:15:15] <%Captainahab_37> because if you get the dick it ruins the whole mystery
[2:15:20] <%MisterRockett> Alloy acts like relying on other people will physically kill her.
[2:15:22] <%Captainahab_37> you need mystique
[2:15:24] <StarMechV> Yeehaw
[2:15:32] <@Ranryu692> I've ridden a robocow for a few seconds
[2:15:34] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt My favorite thing about Destiny 1 is that it kept all its good expansions
[2:15:37] <%Captainahab_37> facial animations in games look so fuckin weird now
[2:15:42] <+FierceDeityGabe> The second area?
[2:15:43] <%chiazam> Meridian is cool
[2:15:46] <%maskofmichael> yee and or haa
[2:15:50] <%AncelDeLambert> woah, was that pop in on my end?
[2:15:52] <outsidedoubtside> Using the coolant hoses for reins is a choice
[2:15:52] <%MisterRockett> Pat you really did NOT get half way through the game lol.
[2:15:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> AHAHAHA aw its adorable hes bad at it
[2:15:57] <+theoldone001> Is the Ubisoft like formula still strong??
[2:15:59] <Kain5707> destiny 1 was good
[2:16:03] <ThePowerOfRa420> The animations are definitely better in this
[2:16:05] <%PrimalDweeb> Never mind us, we're just awesome.
[2:16:05] <StarMechV> @MisterRockett Alloy is having an issue of "I'm the only one who knows about the real history and so everyone else sound like cavemen"
[2:16:06] <%slandracon> God these games are so good, just to get fucked over by scheduling.
[2:16:09] <%chiazam> She's a big hero now
[2:16:10] <%sighphers> wow this is moving FAST
[2:16:17] <%chiazam> HEY BLAMELESS

[2:16:26] <%PrimalDweeb> Yeah, it's moving way too fast.
[2:16:28] <%Captainahab_37> Imagine naming yourself blameless
[2:16:29] <%luftraumm1> they're kind of mayan
[2:16:30] <%AncelDeLambert> at least he knows her well enough to tell her immediately "stop beeing a neet and enjoy them thinking you're cool"
[2:16:31] <$Falilth> @PatStaresAt  they'
[2:16:33] <%Captainahab_37> you could get away with anything
[2:16:33] <@QueequegTheater> They're like Persian-Romans
[2:16:34] <Kain5707> @Kain5707 agree
[2:16:39] <$Falilth> they're just 40k centurians
[2:16:39] <tanarath> @kain5707 red growth killing everything, need gaia ai to fix things, humanity's turbo-fucked & reduced to hunter-gatherers.
[2:16:45] <%RayReborne> THIS GUYS FACE IS SOME OTHER DUDE FROM THE NORA WTF
[2:16:52] <%PrimalDweeb> It's like they have no concept of pacing.
[2:17:01] <%Dakuu75> I'm waiting for the part where ANYTHING bad happens and everyone imediately blames Alloy
[2:17:02] <@QueequegTheater> @PrimalDweeb There's a canon explanation for that
[2:17:03] <%MisterRockett> @MisterRockett Her "I was an atheist and then got proven right" schtick is honestly her worst quality lol.

[2:17:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PrimalDweeb Humanity went extinct, everyone was regrown after the fact from clones
[2:17:45] <%AncelDeLambert> the most fun I actually had in the first game was realizing that the game takes place in and around Yellowstone National Park and comparing the game map to a real map
[2:17:47] <%VentWilsn> @Dakuu75 im waiting for everyone to turn on Aloy as soon as she talks about her connection to Elizabet

[2:18:14] <%chiazam> @MisterRockett To be fair it's hard not to be bitter about that seeing as they're traditions meant she grew up an Outcast

[2:20:08] <ohno58> lucky ted
[2:20:11] <%shootbang_exe> porque no los dos
[2:20:13] <xbb1024> I have an odd feeling that Pat would side with Sylens
[2:20:13] <%chiazam> Or Sylens
[2:20:13] <%RayReborne> not Ted, Sylens
[2:20:17] <%PrimalDweeb> God damn it Ted
[2:20:19] <@QueequegTheater> Or Zuckussy
[2:20:21] <%MisterRockett> @MisterRockett It's more a problem I have with that entire direction of the writing where you create a new universe with a belief system that's really interesting and then make your star character someone who believes in none of it so they can roll their eyes and be smarter than everyone. She has understandable reasons to believe the things she does but it comes off as wish fulfillment from atheist writers.
[2:20:21] <tanarath> I feel like it was already out there.
[2:20:22] <%Captainahab_37> Jimmy the Grape AI
[2:20:24] <%RayReborne> Sylens the TWAT
[2:20:31] <Seth_Tek> the vibe I get from this series it is a playable young adult adventure novel.
[2:20:35] <%blastyoboots> What about the logic bomb
[2:20:38] <ThePowerOfRa420> Classic souls "just dont touch it idiot "
[2:20:39] <Samuel412> If it was somehow Ted again, this game is amazing
[2:20:47] <$Falilth> i have to go watch the lance reddick destiny meme again
[2:20:48] <%Dakuu75> everyone watching her do this platforming like, "wtf?" lol
[2:20:51] <jtsoppy137> Bonk
[2:20:56] <%AncelDeLambert> everyone who played the first game who hates the guy who programmed Hades hands up!
[2:21:06] <%Captainahab_37> i forgot everything about 1
[2:21:12] <penitentpendant> Good ole Sylens
[2:21:14] <%Captainahab_37> aside from major cloneage
[2:21:15] <+RogueCrocodile> To go to war on mars
[2:21:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> To meme on you aloy
[2:21:24] <%AncelDeLambert> he was the guy who enjoyed watching torture porn
[2:21:29] <%mostbrokenrobo> this lady has to be jacked to do this.  full shredtown
[2:21:32] <%AncelDeLambert> and snuff films
[2:21:53] <%Captainahab_37> that or she weighs 6 pounds
[2:21:57] <%Felhad> Just hopping in, game good?
[2:22:00] <dan_g_v> are those robot helicopters?
[2:22:02] <%Captainahab_37> clones are lighter than humans
[2:22:02] <%Fooguwu> I can't believe Sylens activated the Robussy
[2:22:04] <%AncelDeLambert> climbing is easier than you think
[2:22:14] <scrumbotime> triangles, the most evil of shapes
[2:22:16] <ScreamLord> Well, HADES was supposed to kill all living things if the terraforming was botched. The evil grass and storms suggest to me the terraforming is botched
[2:22:18] <%Dakuu75> are triangles evil?
[2:22:18] <@QueequegTheater> @AncelDeLambert I feel like that difference is just a distinction of editing
[2:22:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> triangles, the sharp, evil shape
[2:22:20] <arkv01> triangles = ancient mayan aliens
[2:22:23] <%Captainahab_37> dude humans really loved triangles before death
[2:22:25] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Where did the rqin come from?
[2:22:27] <%AncelDeLambert> how the fuck did it start raining this hard in ten seconds?
[2:22:27] <fistynopunches> Finna send out the 6G signals
[2:22:30] <Samuel412> @AncelDeLambert I don't think it was meant to be literal snuff just torture porn movies.
[2:22:31] <BreakfastSampler> triangle strategy
[2:22:34] <+Casual_Nopon> Time to ctivate the 5G tower
[2:22:35] <jtsoppy137> and pointy
[2:22:36] <medril07> can always rely on a good robot triangle
[2:22:36] <+YharnamNighthawk> What about pyramids
[2:22:37] <@QueequegTheater> shut up, it's raining now
[2:22:38] <rosemon5001> are you sure this isnt a secret starwars game isth in nature? Kappa
[2:22:39] <mr_saturday93> in destiny they're evil
[2:22:40] <%Captainahab_37> no acute angles in the future
[2:22:44] <dan_g_v> oh no 5g
[2:22:44] <ThePowerOfRa420> Nah its The most evil shape
[2:22:50] <%PrimalDweeb> Yep, game looks much better now. Which means the rest of the game is too bright.
[2:22:51] <%Felhad> @anceldelambert Must be in Florida instead of Cali
[2:22:51] <TheMostAverageGamer4> glad they didnt make you climb all of the tower
[2:22:52] <%barrakuta371> evil destiny triangles

[2:22:59] <Explodincatz> a hexagon is a collection of triangles
[2:23:01] <%derpmandwn999> Triangles aren’t evil. PYRAMIDS THOUGH
[2:23:04] <%chiazam> Sylens you dumbfuck
[2:23:04] <%AncelDeLambert> .... WHY
[2:23:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Ruse
[2:23:05] <medril07> somewhere to the forbidden west
[2:23:07] <%Captainahab_37> is it forbidden because they build with squares like minecraft
[2:23:08] <majindusto> The Triforce is Three Triangles...Definitely  not Evil
[2:23:08] <ThePowerOfRa420> Anime
[2:23:09] <SpaceGuntank> oh no
[2:23:11] <%AncelDeLambert> oh it's not a recording
[2:23:17] <%AncelDeLambert> somehow they're talking, lol

[2:23:40] <@QueequegTheater> Is this Endwalker
[2:23:41] <MidnightPacif1c> @malcobraaklynny hell yeah
[2:23:42] <%Fooguwu> was he just standing there in his VR chat machine waiting for her to do this
[2:23:45] <%Captainahab_37> or....did he die? i thought he died?
[2:23:48] <+RogueCrocodile> Damn you Zavala
[2:23:50] <penitentpendant> Title Drop
[2:23:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Title Drop
[2:23:50] <%depressed_skeleton> HE SAID THE THING
[2:23:51] <ohno58> when you stop being a hater
[2:23:51] <malcobraaklynny> HE SAID IT
[2:23:52] <stormhawk9891> TITLE DROP
[2:23:52] <SpaceGuntank> yay namedrop!
[2:23:54] <@QueequegTheater> @Captainahab_37 no
[2:23:57] <Treasure_Vault> lol i copied satan on a floppy
[2:23:57] <cholesteroid> HE SAID THE THING
[2:23:58] <SpellCatty> HE SAID THE THING
[2:23:59] <xbb1024> Sylens does want to bring back the old world knowledge
[2:24:01] <ThePowerOfRa420> Lets go POG
[2:24:03] <earthboy2k> He sounds like Johnson from Peep Show
[2:24:04] <+Casual_Nopon> He has a point, But why did he have to be an ass about it
[2:24:05] <+UltraViolet371> yeah Hades is great
[2:24:07] <%AncelDeLambert> he.... has not. He's basically trapped Satan in a bottle
[2:24:07] <$SGrim> Cause lie
[2:24:08] <%RayReborne> HE DISCOVERED HADES BRO
[2:24:10] <%TheWinged7> he seems like a bit of a aprick, but yeah
[2:24:11] <%Captainahab_37> i need to replay it i guess
[2:24:13] <%MisterRockett> I fucking LOVE Sylens. He's basically Alloy on a different spectrum. He throws her attitude right back at him. He's 100% right all of the time but is an asshole about it.
[2:24:15] <%chiazam> Sylens isn't Evil but his problem is he's a fuckass who always hides info and isn't forthcoming AT ALL
[2:24:15] <%AncelDeLambert> he SAVED Hades from deletion
[2:24:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Cause red head
[2:24:16] <mr_saturday93> She was tricked that's why
[2:24:19] <hakumaribo> holy shit that water effect is nice
[2:24:21] <Jontman42> why don't you come and find me in Horizon Forbidden West
[2:24:21] <@QueequegTheater> ALOY. HE HAS A COPY OF HADES, WHICH MEANS HE HAS A COPY OF APOLLO. THIS IS A GOOD THING.
[2:24:23] <auraoftheearth009> He's probably not evil, just inquisitive. But it will most likely lead to accidental evil
[2:24:23] <tanarath> He's... trying. Also Hades doesn't sound great.
[2:24:26] <SaltyFront> @Casual_Nopon this is the core of sylens' character
[2:24:26] <majindusto> HE DON'T  SEEM THAT BAD
[2:24:29] <%Felhad> you cant not open the Satan
[2:24:29] <ThePowerOfRa420> True
[2:24:31] <@QueequegTheater> Maybe
[2:24:31] <%RayReborne> HES GONNA THO HES SUPER INTO THAT SHIT
[2:24:34] <rosemon5001> but how else will he keep the race pure?
[2:24:35] <medril07> hey it's the moon general
[2:24:36] <%chiazam> LIKE HE COULD HAVE JUST TOLD HER
[2:24:38] <%PrimalDweeb> But the bottle *will* be opened given enough time.
[2:24:39] <%Captainahab_37> what if Aloy the evil
[2:24:39] <%AncelDeLambert> ... I don't think there's a copy of Apollo
[2:24:40] <%Chichen> use your demon summoning program
[2:24:41] <$Emperor_Machinus> drink the satan in the bottle you say?
[2:24:47] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Sylens likes to watch snuff films, he's gonna open it
[2:24:54] <Gelphaze> JUST DON"T OPEN THE BOTTLE!
[2:24:54] <%derpmandwn999> Don’t open the evil juice, it’s EVIL
[2:25:04] <%Captainahab_37> Sylens binges Salo everyday
[2:25:04] <@QueequegTheater> Frisco DansGame
[2:25:19] <%Captainahab_37> people are ruder there, Aloy
[2:25:20] <medril07> why does the apocalypse always have cool dreads?
[2:25:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> so the weather just conveniently changed for the precise duration of that sequence
[2:25:27] <%Captainahab_37> the rent, it is bullshit
[2:25:31] <ohno58> they're liberal over there
[2:25:34] <@QueequegTheater> Time to kill Caesar's Legion

[2:25:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> About to be betrayed
[2:25:50] <%Captainahab_37> "California RUINED you Aloy!" - Sylens
[2:25:50] <+simmsyfart> why did the make a monster hunter level terrible plot the main focus
[2:25:52] <@QueequegTheater> @Explodincatz Just let humanity die instead
[2:25:53] <%chiazam> New rival tribe?

[2:37:27] <+m3chamike> I love the fact that the different factions have extremely distinctive designs.
[2:37:32] <@QueequegTheater> The Nora are cool tribals tho
[2:37:36] <+theoldone001> Pat claims to love sick hats, but he never wears one. Curious.
[2:37:37] <%sighphers> best way to make me like a character: good outfits
[2:37:37] <stormhawk9891> I don't know what a nora is, but it sounds like a bitch

[2:50:23] <%Captainahab_37> the nora were orphan racist to Aloy so she was a social outcast right?
[2:50:41] <@QueequegTheater> @Gorgodrn She also had her arrogant atheist moment with Varl earlier
[2:50:48] <jtsoppy137> Aoly from Minecraft
