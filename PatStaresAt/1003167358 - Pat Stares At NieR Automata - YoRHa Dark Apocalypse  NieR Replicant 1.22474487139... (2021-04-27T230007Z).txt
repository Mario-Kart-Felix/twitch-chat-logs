[0:13:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Daily reminder that Woolie the Coward never deleted his save file
[0:13:27] <%Dakuu75> his brain went through like 20 different things and settled on "butt"
[0:13:27] <+NYCrownlessKing> fact woolie is having a friend do the neir raid on his channel. means something lol
[0:13:28] <%valriot> Her Boys Love manga

[0:14:11] <%Garthunox> Pat, have you heard about the #TowelBoy shit?
[0:14:12] <Ipsenscastle> Woolie makes some weird fuckin' choices. Like constantly
[0:14:20] <%athuramn> is that content considered world building?
[0:14:22] <ItsPastas> Weird, my last piece of junk on the bunker was in the alien ship sector, not on 2B's room
[0:14:28] <DianaTheAscian> So Woolie put in extra effort to do nothing for 3-4 hrs @PatStaresAt
[0:14:55] <$PinkertonDanPie> what's towel boy

[0:17:18] <ItsPastas> @Vyskus yeah, their copies, that's what I meant
[0:17:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Did Taro make another ten second quest for 14 AGAIN?
[0:17:22] <+D00msDayDan> are these quests on a weekly lockout or can you do them all in one sitting?
[0:17:30] <%Garthunox> @penitentpendant yeah but the weekly quests, that there's one a week of?
[0:17:33] <causewaybob> Oh dope right on time.did that quest only take 15 mins
[0:17:40] <%Garthunox> @D00msDayDan 1 a week
[0:17:48] <Vyskus> yeeeeeeee
[0:18:15] <+D00msDayDan> @D00msDayDan i mean do they unlock a week at a time or can you only complete one a week
[0:18:16] <%bigboyeggo> @AncelDeLambert YOU BET HE DID
[0:18:18] <%jtdobyns> also when all done.. can you do them in a row.. or will they always and forever be weekly?
